i
walking
papers
through
the
suave
warm
radiance
of
that
afternoon
of
spring
in
england
a
gentleman
of
modest
and
commonly
amiable
deportment
bore
a
rueful
countenance
down
piccadilly
and
into
halfmoon
street
where
presently
he
introduced
it
to
one
whom
he
found
awaiting
him
in
his
lodgings
much
at
ease
in
his
easiest
chair
making
free
with
his
whiskey
and
tobacco
and
reading
a
slender
brown
volume
selected
from
his
shelves
this
dégagé
person
was
patently
an
englishman
though
there
were
traces
of
oriental
ancestry
in
his
cast
the
other
he
of
the
doleful
habit
was
as
unmistakably
of
gallic
pattern
though
he
dressed
and
carried
himself
in
a
thoroughly
fashion
and
even
seemed
a
trace
intrigued
when
greeted
by
a
name
distinctively
french
for
the
englishman
rousing
from
his
appropriated
ease
dropped
his
book
to
the
floor
beside
the
chair
uprose
and
extended
a
cordial
hand
exclaiming
ye
monsieur
duchemin
to
this
the
other
responded
after
a
slight
pause
obscurely
enough
oh
ancient
history
eh
well
for
the
matter
of
that
how
are
you
mister
wertheimer
their
hands
fell
apart
and
monsieur
duchemin
proceeded
to
do
away
his
hat
and
stick
and
chamois
gloves
while
his
friend
straddling
in
front
of
a
cold
grate
and
extending
his
hands
to
an
imaginary
blaze
covered
with
a
mild
complaint
the
curiosity
excited
by
a
brief
study
of
that
face
of
melancholy
pretty
way
you
got
of
making
your
friends
wait
on
your
pleasure
here
i
wasted
upwards
of
two
hours
of
his
majesty
time
how
was
i
to
know
you
have
the
cheek
to
force
your
way
in
here
in
my
absence
and
help
yourself
to
my
few
poor
consolations
duchemin
retorted
helping
himself
to
them
in
turn
but
then
one
never
does
know
what
fresh
indignity
fate
has
in
store
after
you
with
that
whiskey
by
your
leave
i
say
i
give
something
to
know
where
you
ignorant
furriners
come
by
this
precious
stuff
but
without
waiting
to
be
denied
this
information
wertheimer
continued
going
on
the
evidence
of
your
looks
and
temper
you
been
down
to
tilbury
docks
this
afternoon
to
see
karslake
and
sonia
off
a
few
such
flashes
of
intelligence
applied
professionally
my
friend
should
carry
you
far
and
the
experience
has
left
you
feeling
a
bit
down
what
i
imagine
even
you
do
not
esteem
parting
with
those
whom
one
loves
an
exhilarating
pastime
but
when
it
so
obviously
for
their
own
good
oh
i
know
duchemin
agreed
without
enthusiasm
if
anything
should
happen
to
karslake
now
it
would
break
sonia
heart
but
and
after
the
part
he
played
in
that
vassilyevski
show
his
lease
of
life
would
be
apt
to
be
prolonged
by
staying
on
in
england
i
agree
but
still
sighed
duchemin
throwing
himself
heavily
into
a
chair
which
wertheimer
continued
standing
is
why
we
arranged
to
give
him
that
billet
with
the
british
legation
in
peking
did
know
you
had
a
hand
in
that
observed
duchemin
after
favouring
the
other
with
a
morose
stare
oh
you
ca
trust
me
when
you
get
to
know
me
better
you
find
always
like
that
forever
flitting
hither
and
yon
bestowing
benefits
and
boons
on
the
ungrateful
like
any
other
giddy
providence
but
one
is
not
ungrateful
duchemin
insisted
god
knows
i
would
gladly
have
sped
karslake
emigration
with
sonia
to
van
dieman
land
or
patagonia
or
where
you
will
if
it
promised
to
keep
him
out
of
the
way
long
enough
for
the
smolny
institute
to
forget
him
since
the
said
smolny
inconsiderately
persists
in
failing
to
collapse
as
per
the
daily
predictions
of
the
hopeful
just
so
but
are
you
forgetting
you
yourself
have
given
that
smolny
lot
the
same
and
quite
as
much
reason
for
holding
your
name
anathema
ah
duchemin
growled
as
for
me
i
can
take
care
of
myself
thank
you
my
trouble
is
i
want
somebody
else
to
take
care
of
i
had
a
daughter
once
for
a
few
weeks
long
enough
to
make
me
strangely
fond
of
the
responsibilities
of
a
father
and
then
karslake
took
her
away
leaving
me
nothing
to
do
with
my
life
but
twiddle
futile
thumbs
and
contemplate
the
approach
of
middle
age
middle
age
why
flatter
yourself
with
a
daughter
married
too
sonia
only
eighteen
she
was
born
when
you
were
twenty
that
makes
you
nearly
forty
and
that
next
door
to
second
childhood
man
the
englishman
declared
solemnly
you
superannuated
i
know
and
so
long
as
i
feel
my
years
even
you
can
abuse
me
with
impunity
but
wertheimer
would
not
hear
him
odd
he
mused
i
never
thought
of
it
before
that
you
were
growing
old
and
i
been
wondering
too
what
it
was
that
has
been
making
you
so
precious
slow
and
cautious
and
cranky
of
late
you
just
doddering
and
i
thought
you
were
simply
tired
out
and
needed
a
holiday
perhaps
i
am
and
do
said
duchemin
patiently
one
feels
one
has
earned
a
holiday
if
ever
anybody
did
in
your
blessed
ah
you
think
so
you
think
so
if
you
been
mucking
round
the
east
end
all
winter
with
your
life
in
your
hands
still
at
your
age
i
be
thinking
about
retiring
instead
of
asking
for
a
rest
although
duchemin
knew
very
well
that
he
was
merely
being
ragged
in
that
way
of
deadly
seriousness
which
so
often
amuses
the
english
he
chose
to
suggest
sourly
my
resignation
is
at
your
disposal
any
time
you
wish
it
accepted
said
wertheimer
airily
to
take
effect
at
once
to
this
duchemin
merely
grunted
as
who
should
say
he
did
consider
this
turn
of
conversation
desperately
amusing
and
wertheimer
resuming
his
chair
the
two
remained
for
some
moments
in
silence
a
silence
so
doggedly
maintained
on
both
sides
that
duchemin
was
presently
aware
of
dull
gnawings
of
curiosity
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
caller
should
have
found
plenty
to
do
in
his
bureau
in
the
war
office
and
to
what
he
enquired
with
the
tedious
irony
of
ennui
is
one
indebted
for
this
unexpected
honour
on
the
part
of
the
first
of
the
british
secret
service
or
whatever
your
official
title
is
oh
wertheimer
replied
lazily
and
knocked
out
his
pipe
i
merely
dropped
in
to
say
duchemin
discovered
symptoms
of
more
animation
hello
where
are
you
off
to
nowhere
worse
luck
i
mean
i
here
to
bid
you
farewell
and
godspeed
and
what
not
on
the
eve
of
your
departure
from
the
british
isles
and
where
pray
am
i
going
that
for
you
to
say
monsieur
duchemin
meditated
briefly
i
see
he
announced
i
to
have
a
roving
commission
worse
than
that
none
at
all
duchemin
opened
his
eyes
wide
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
wertheimer
affirmed
how
do
i
know
whither
you
blow
now
you
a
free
agent
again
entirely
on
your
own
i
got
no
control
over
your
movements
the
s
has
never
no
more
did
you
tender
me
your
resignation
a
moment
ago
was
it
promptly
accepted
look
here
what
the
devil
well
if
you
must
know
the
englishman
interrupted
hastily
my
instructions
were
to
give
you
your
walking
papers
if
you
refused
to
resign
so
your
connection
with
the
is
from
this
hour
severed
and
if
you
ai
out
of
england
within
hours
we
jolly
well
deport
you
and
that
that
one
perceives
one
has
served
england
not
wisely
but
too
well
shrewd
lad
wertheimer
laughed
you
see
old
soul
we
admire
you
no
end
and
we
determined
to
save
your
life
word
has
leaked
through
from
petrograd
that
your
name
has
been
on
the
index
expurgatorius
karslake
too
an
honour
legitimately
earned
by
your
pernicious
collaboration
in
the
vassilyevski
bust
already
taken
care
of
but
you
still
in
the
limelight
and
that
makes
you
a
public
nuisance
if
you
linger
here
much
longer
the
verdict
will
undoubtedly
be
violent
death
at
the
hands
of
some
person
or
persons
unknown
so
here
are
passports
and
a
goodish
bit
of
money
if
you
run
through
all
of
it
before
this
blows
over
we
find
a
way
of
course
to
get
more
to
you
you
understand
no
price
too
high
that
buys
good
riddance
of
you
and
there
will
be
a
destroyer
waiting
at
portsmouth
with
instructions
to
put
ashore
secretly
anywhere
you
like
across
the
channel
after
that
as
far
as
the
british
empire
is
concerned
your
blood
be
on
your
own
head
the
other
nodded
investigating
the
envelope
which
his
late
chief
had
handed
him
then
from
his
letter
of
credit
and
passports
looked
up
with
a
reminiscent
smile
it
is
the
first
time
you
vouched
for
me
by
this
style
remember
well
you
earned
as
fair
title
to
the
name
of
duchemin
as
i
ever
did
to
that
of
wertheimer
but
the
smile
was
fading
from
the
eyes
of
the
man
whom
england
preferred
to
recognize
as
andré
duchemin
but
where
on
earth
is
one
to
go
do
ask
me
the
englishman
protested
and
above
all
do
tell
me
i
do
want
to
know
since
i
been
on
this
job
i
learned
to
believe
in
telepathy
and
mind
reading
and
witchcraft
and
all
manner
of
unholy
rot
and
i
do
want
you
to
come
to
a
sudden
end
through
somebody
establishing
illicit
intercourse
with
my
subconscious
mind
he
took
his
leave
shortly
after
that
and
monsieur
duchemin
settled
down
in
the
chair
which
his
guest
had
quitted
to
grapple
with
his
problem
where
under
heaven
to
go
after
a
wasted
while
he
picked
up
in
abstraction
the
book
which
wertheimer
had
been
reading
and
wondered
if
by
any
chance
he
had
left
it
there
on
purpose
so
strong
seemed
the
hint
it
was
with
a
donkey
duchemin
was
familiar
enough
with
the
work
and
had
no
need
to
dip
anew
into
its
pages
to
know
it
offered
one
fair
solution
to
his
quandary
if
he
assured
himself
there
were
any
place
in
europe
where
one
might
count
on
being
reasonably
secure
from
the
solicitous
attentions
of
the
bolsheviki
it
was
the
cévennes
those
hills
in
the
south
of
france
well
inland
from
the
sea
ii
one
walks
a
little
place
called
le
monastier
in
a
pleasant
highland
valley
fifteen
miles
from
le
puy
notable
for
the
making
of
lace
for
drunkenness
for
freedom
of
language
and
for
unparalleled
political
dissension
was
stevenson
point
of
departure
on
his
travels
with
a
donkey
monsieur
duchemin
made
it
his
as
well
and
on
the
fourth
morning
of
his
hegira
from
england
set
out
from
le
monastier
afoot
a
volume
of
montaigne
in
his
pocket
a
stout
stick
in
his
fist
the
fat
rucksack
strapped
to
his
shoulders
enabling
this
traveller
to
dispense
with
the
society
of
another
donkey
the
weather
was
fine
his
heart
high
he
was
happy
to
be
out
of
harness
and
again
his
own
man
more
than
once
he
laughed
a
little
to
think
of
the
vain
question
of
his
whereabouts
which
was
being
mooted
in
the
underworld
of
europe
where
as
well
he
knew
men
and
women
spat
when
they
named
him
for
his
route
from
the
channel
coast
to
le
monastier
had
been
sufficiently
discreet
and
devious
to
persuade
him
that
his
escape
had
been
as
cleanly
executed
as
it
was
timely
instigated
thus
for
upwards
of
a
fortnight
he
fared
southward
in
the
footsteps
of
stevenson
and
much
good
profit
had
he
of
the
adventure
for
it
was
his
common
practice
to
go
to
bed
with
the
birds
and
rise
with
the
sun
and
more
often
than
not
he
lodged
in
the
inn
of
the
silver
moon
with
moss
for
a
couch
leafy
boughs
for
a
canopy
and
the
stars
for
accommodations
infinitely
more
agreeable
than
those
afforded
by
the
grubby
and
malodorous
auberge
of
the
wayside
average
and
between
sun
and
sun
he
punished
his
boots
famously
constant
exercise
tuned
up
muscles
gone
slack
and
soft
with
easy
living
upland
winds
cleansed
the
man
of
the
reek
of
cities
and
made
his
appetite
a
thing
appalling
a
keen
sun
darkened
his
face
and
hands
brushed
up
in
his
cheeks
a
warmer
glow
than
they
had
shown
in
many
a
year
and
faded
out
the
heavier
lines
with
which
time
had
marked
his
countenance
moreover
because
this
was
france
where
one
may
affect
a
whisker
without
losing
face
he
neglected
his
razors
and
though
this
was
not
his
first
thought
a
fair
disguise
it
proved
for
when
toward
the
end
of
the
second
week
he
submitted
that
wanton
luxuriance
to
be
tamed
by
a
barber
of
florac
he
hardly
knew
the
trimly
bearded
mask
of
bronze
that
looked
back
at
him
from
a
mirror
not
that
it
mattered
to
monsieur
duchemin
from
the
first
he
met
few
of
any
sort
and
none
at
all
whom
a
lively
and
exacting
distrust
reckoned
a
likely
factor
in
his
affairs
it
was
a
wild
bold
land
he
traversed
and
thinly
peopled
at
pains
to
avoid
the
larger
towns
he
sought
by
choice
the
loneliest
paths
that
looped
its
quiet
hills
such
as
passed
the
time
of
day
with
him
were
few
and
for
the
most
part
peasants
a
dull
dour
lot
taciturn
to
a
degree
that
pleased
him
well
so
that
he
soon
forgot
to
be
forever
alert
for
the
crack
of
an
ambushed
pistol
or
the
pattering
footfalls
of
an
assassin
with
a
knife
it
was
at
florac
on
the
tarnon
that
he
parted
company
with
the
trail
of
stevenson
here
that
one
had
turned
east
to
alais
whereas
duchemin
had
been
lost
to
the
world
not
nearly
long
enough
he
was
minded
to
wander
on
till
weary
the
weather
held
there
was
sunshine
in
golden
floods
and
by
night
moonlight
like
molten
silver
between
beetling
ramparts
of
stone
terraced
crenellated
and
battlemented
in
motley
strata
of
pink
and
brown
and
yellow
and
black
the
river
tarn
had
gouged
out
for
itself
a
canyon
through
which
its
waters
swept
and
tumbled
as
green
as
translucent
jade
in
sunlight
profound
emerald
in
shadow
cream
white
in
churning
rapids
the
lofty
profiles
of
its
cliffs
were
fringed
with
stunted
growths
of
pine
and
ash
a
ragged
stubble
while
here
and
there
châteaux
forsaken
as
a
rule
and
crumbling
reared
ruined
silhouettes
against
the
blue
eighteen
hundred
feet
below
it
might
be
more
the
tarn
threaded
lush
tilled
fields
goodly
orchards
plantations
of
walnut
and
spanish
chestnut
and
infrequent
tiny
villages
that
clung
to
precarious
footholds
between
cliffs
and
water
on
high
again
beyond
the
cliffs
stretched
the
causses
vast
arid
and
barren
plateaux
flat
and
featureless
save
for
an
occasional
low
rounded
mound
a
menhir
or
a
dolmen
and
if
such
may
be
termed
features
great
pits
that
opened
in
the
earth
like
cold
craters
which
the
countryfolk
termed
avens
a
strange
bleak
land
inhospitable
haunted
the
home
of
seven
howling
devils
of
desolation
rain
at
length
interned
the
traveller
for
three
days
in
a
little
place
called
meyrueis
which
lies
sweetly
in
the
valley
of
the
jonte
at
its
confluence
with
the
butézon
long
leagues
remote
from
railroads
and
the
world
they
stitch
together
that
world
of
unrest
uncertainty
and
intrigue
which
in
those
days
seemed
no
better
than
a
madhouse
the
break
in
the
monotony
of
daily
footfaring
proved
agreeable
it
suited
one
well
to
camp
for
a
space
in
that
quaint
town
isolate
in
the
heart
of
an
enchanted
land
with
which
one
was
in
turn
enchanted
and
contemplate
soberly
the
grave
issues
of
life
and
death
here
said
duchemin
nothing
can
disturb
me
and
it
is
high
time
for
me
to
be
considering
what
i
am
to
make
of
the
remainder
of
my
days
too
many
of
them
have
been
wasted
too
great
a
portion
of
my
span
has
been
sacrificed
to
vanities
one
must
not
forget
one
is
in
a
fair
way
to
become
a
grandfather
it
is
plainly
an
urgent
duty
to
reconcile
oneself
to
that
estate
and
cultivate
its
proper
gravity
and
decorum
yet
a
little
while
and
one
must
bid
adieu
to
that
youth
which
one
has
so
heedlessly
squandered
a
last
adieu
to
youth
with
its
days
of
high
adventure
its
carefree
heart
its
susceptibility
to
the
infinite
seductions
of
romance
quite
seriously
the
adventurer
entertained
a
premonition
of
his
a
vision
of
himself
in
and
seedy
clothing
the
trousers
at
the
knees
with
rather
more
than
a
mere
hint
of
an
equator
emphasized
by
on
his
waistcoat
presiding
over
the
fortunes
of
one
of
those
dingy
little
parisian
shops
wherein
debatable
antiques
accumulate
dust
till
they
fetch
the
ducats
of
the
credulous
and
of
a
sunday
walking
out
in
a
shiny
with
his
ribbon
of
the
legion
in
the
buttonhole
a
ratty
topper
crowning
his
placid
brows
a
humid
grandchild
adhering
to
his
hand
a
thrifty
and
respectable
bourgeois
the
final
avatar
of
a
rolling
stone
yes
it
is
amusing
but
quite
true
though
it
would
need
a
deal
of
contriving
something
little
short
of
a
revolution
to
bring
it
about
to
precisely
such
a
future
as
that
did
duchemin
most
seriously
propose
to
dedicate
himself
but
always
they
say
it
is
god
who
disposes
and
for
all
this
mood
of
premature
resignation
to
the
bourgeois
virtues
duchemin
was
glad
enough
when
his
fourth
day
in
meyrueis
dawned
fair
and
by
eight
was
up
and
away
purposing
a
round
day
tramp
across
the
causse
noir
to
concerning
which
one
heard
curious
tales
then
on
by
way
of
the
gorge
of
the
dourbie
to
millau
for
the
night
nor
would
he
heed
the
dubious
head
shaken
by
his
host
of
meyrueis
who
earnestly
advised
a
guide
the
causses
he
declared
were
treacherous
men
sometimes
lost
their
way
upon
those
lofty
plains
and
were
never
heard
of
more
duchemin
did
in
the
least
mind
getting
lost
that
is
to
say
failing
to
make
his
final
objective
at
worst
he
could
depend
upon
a
good
memory
and
an
unfailing
sense
of
direction
to
lead
him
back
the
way
he
had
come
he
was
to
learn
there
is
nothing
more
unpalatable
than
the
repentance
of
the
headstrong
he
found
it
a
stiffish
climb
up
out
of
the
valley
of
the
jonte
by
the
time
he
had
managed
it
the
sun
had
already
robbed
all
vegetation
of
its
ephemeral
jewellery
the
causse
itself
showed
few
signs
of
a
downpour
which
had
drenched
it
for
hours
on
end
to
that
porous
limestone
formation
water
in
whatever
quantity
is
as
beer
to
a
boche
only
if
one
paused
to
listen
on
the
brink
of
an
aven
there
were
odd
and
disturbing
noises
to
be
heard
underfoot
liquid
whisperings
grim
chuckles
horrible
gurgles
that
told
of
subterranean
streams
in
spate
coursing
in
darkness
to
destinations
unknown
unguessable
his
path
there
was
no
trace
of
road
ran
snakily
through
a
dense
miniature
forest
of
dwarfed
gnarled
pines
of
a
peculiarly
sombre
green
ever
and
again
in
some
scant
clearing
losing
itself
in
a
web
of
similar
paths
that
converged
from
all
points
of
the
compass
so
that
the
wayfarer
was
fain
to
steer
by
the
sun
and
at
one
time
found
himself
abruptly
on
the
brink
of
a
ravine
that
gashed
the
earth
like
a
cruel
wound
he
worked
his
way
to
an
elevation
which
showed
him
plainly
that
unless
by
a
debatable
detour
of
several
miles
there
was
no
way
to
the
farther
side
but
through
the
depths
of
the
ravine
itself
if
that
descent
was
a
desperate
business
the
subsequent
climb
was
heartbreaking
he
needed
a
long
rest
before
he
was
able
to
plod
on
now
conceiving
the
sun
in
the
guise
of
a
personal
enemy
the
sweat
that
streamed
from
his
face
was
brine
upon
his
lips
for
hours
it
was
thus
with
duchemin
and
in
all
that
time
he
met
never
a
soul
once
he
saw
from
a
distance
a
lonely
château
overhanging
another
ravine
but
it
was
apparently
only
one
more
of
the
many
ruins
indigenous
to
that
land
and
he
took
no
step
toward
closer
acquaintance
long
after
noon
sheer
fool
luck
led
him
to
a
hamlet
whose
mean
auberge
served
him
bread
and
cheese
with
a
wine
singularly
thin
and
acid
here
he
enquired
for
a
guide
but
the
one
man
in
evidence
a
hulking
surly
animal
on
learning
that
duchemin
wished
to
visit
refused
with
a
growl
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
several
times
during
the
course
of
luncheon
he
caught
the
fellow
eyeing
him
strangely
he
thought
from
a
window
of
the
auberge
in
the
end
the
peasant
girl
who
waited
on
him
grudgingly
consented
to
put
him
on
his
way
in
a
rocky
gorge
called
the
rajol
a
spot
as
inhumanly
grotesque
as
a
nightmare
of
gustave
doré
with
the
heat
of
a
pit
in
tophet
he
laboured
for
hours
the
hush
of
evening
and
its
long
shadows
were
on
the
land
when
finally
he
scrambled
out
to
the
causse
again
then
he
lost
his
path
another
time
missed
entirely
the
village
of
maubert
where
he
had
thought
to
find
a
conveyance
or
at
least
a
guide
and
in
the
silver
and
purple
mystery
of
a
perfect
moonlight
night
found
himself
looking
down
from
a
hilltop
upon
rumour
had
prepared
him
to
know
the
place
when
he
saw
it
nothing
for
its
stupendous
lunacy
heaven
knows
what
convulsion
or
measured
process
of
nature
accomplished
this
thing
for
his
part
duchemin
was
unable
to
accept
any
possible
scientific
explanation
and
will
go
to
his
grave
believing
that
some
cyclops
back
beyond
the
dimmest
dawn
of
time
created
in
an
hour
of
idleness
building
him
a
play
city
of
titanic
monoliths
then
wandered
away
and
forgot
it
altogether
he
saw
what
seemed
to
be
a
city
at
least
two
miles
in
length
more
than
half
as
wide
a
huddle
of
dwellings
of
every
shape
and
size
a
labyrinth
of
narrow
tortuous
streets
broken
here
and
there
by
wide
and
stately
avenues
with
public
squares
and
vast
cirques
of
such
amphitheatres
he
counted
no
less
than
six
and
walls
commanded
by
a
citadel
but
never
door
or
window
broke
the
face
of
any
building
no
chimney
exhaled
a
breath
of
smoke
neither
wheel
nor
foot
disturbed
these
thoroughfares
indeed
duchemin
reflected
but
rather
dead
with
the
utter
deadness
of
that
which
has
never
lived
marvelling
he
went
down
into
the
city
of
stone
and
passed
through
its
desolate
ways
shaping
a
course
for
the
southern
limits
where
he
thought
to
find
the
road
to
millau
fatigue
alone
dictated
this
choice
of
the
short
cut
but
for
that
he
confesses
he
might
have
gone
the
long
way
round
he
was
no
more
prone
to
childish
terrors
than
any
other
man
but
to
his
mind
there
was
something
sinister
in
the
portentous
immobility
of
the
place
in
its
silence
its
want
of
excuse
for
being
a
sense
of
evil
like
an
inarticulate
menace
out
of
this
mood
he
failed
to
laugh
himself
time
and
again
he
would
catch
himself
listening
for
he
knew
not
what
approaching
warily
the
corner
of
the
next
huge
monolith
as
if
thinking
to
surprise
behind
it
some
ghoulish
rite
glancing
apprehensively
down
the
corridors
he
passed
or
overshoulder
for
some
nameless
thing
that
stalked
him
and
was
never
there
when
he
looked
but
ever
lurked
impishly
just
beyond
the
tail
of
his
eye
so
that
when
abruptly
a
man
moved
from
behind
a
rock
some
thirty
or
forty
paces
ahead
duchemin
stopped
short
with
jangled
nerves
and
a
barely
smothered
exclamation
possibly
a
shape
of
spectral
terror
would
have
been
less
startling
in
that
weird
place
and
hour
humanity
seemed
more
incongruous
than
the
supernatural
it
was
at
once
apparent
that
the
man
had
neither
knowledge
of
nor
concern
with
the
stranger
for
an
instant
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
latter
peering
intently
down
the
aisle
which
duchemin
had
been
following
a
stout
body
filling
out
too
well
the
uniform
of
a
private
soldier
in
the
american
expeditionary
forces
that
most
ungainly
inutile
unbecoming
costume
that
ever
graced
the
form
of
man
then
he
half
turned
beckoned
hastily
to
one
invisible
to
the
observer
and
furtively
moved
on
as
furtively
his
signal
was
answered
by
a
fellow
who
wore
the
nondescript
garments
of
a
peasant
and
as
suddenly
as
they
had
come
into
sight
the
two
slipped
round
a
rocky
shoulder
and
the
street
of
monoliths
was
empty
iii
meeting
by
moonlight
now
granting
that
a
soldier
should
be
free
to
spend
his
leave
where
he
will
unchallenged
it
remained
true
that
the
last
of
the
had
long
since
said
farewell
to
the
shores
of
france
while
the
tarn
country
seemed
a
far
cry
from
the
banks
of
the
rhine
in
those
days
still
under
occupation
by
forces
of
the
united
states
regular
army
then
too
it
was
a
fact
within
the
knowledge
of
monsieur
duchemin
that
the
uniform
of
the
americans
had
more
than
frequently
been
used
by
those
ancient
acquaintances
of
his
the
apaches
of
paris
as
a
cloak
for
their
own
misdoings
so
it
did
need
the
air
of
stealth
that
marked
this
business
to
persuade
him
there
was
mischief
in
the
brew
but
indeed
he
got
in
motion
to
investigate
without
stopping
to
debate
an
excuse
for
so
doing
and
several
seconds
before
he
heard
the
cries
of
these
the
first
sounded
shrill
with
alarm
as
duchemin
turned
the
corner
where
the
prowlers
had
gone
from
sight
but
a
high
wall
of
rock
alone
met
his
vision
and
he
broke
into
a
run
that
carried
him
round
still
another
corner
and
then
plumped
him
headlong
into
the
theatre
of
villainy
this
was
open
ground
a
breadth
of
turf
bordering
on
one
of
the
great
cirques
a
rudely
oval
pit
at
a
guess
little
less
than
seven
hundred
feet
in
its
narrowest
diameter
and
something
like
four
hundred
in
depth
a
vast
black
well
against
whose
darkness
the
moonglare
etched
a
strange
grouping
of
figures
seven
in
all
on
his
one
hand
duchemin
saw
a
woman
in
mourning
clasping
to
her
bosom
a
terrified
young
girl
the
author
of
the
screams
on
the
other
three
men
in
grimmest
combat
one
defending
himself
against
two
with
indifferent
success
while
in
between
stood
a
third
woman
with
her
back
to
and
perilously
near
the
chasm
shrinking
from
the
threat
of
a
pistol
in
the
hands
of
the
fourth
man
this
last
was
the
one
nearest
duchemin
who
was
upon
him
so
suddenly
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
was
the
more
surprised
when
duchemin
stick
struck
down
the
pistol
hand
of
the
other
with
such
force
as
must
have
broken
his
wrist
the
weapon
fell
he
uttered
an
oath
as
he
swung
round
clutching
the
maimed
member
and
then
seeing
his
assailant
for
the
first
time
he
swooped
down
to
recover
the
weapon
so
swiftly
that
it
was
in
his
left
hand
and
spitting
vicious
tongues
of
orange
flame
before
duchemin
was
able
to
get
in
a
second
blow
but
there
was
the
abrupt
end
of
that
passage
smitten
cruelly
between
the
eyes
the
fellow
grunted
thickly
and
went
over
backwards
like
a
bundle
of
rags
head
and
shoulders
jutting
out
over
the
brink
of
the
precipice
so
far
that
though
his
body
checked
perceptibly
as
it
struck
the
ground
his
own
weight
carried
him
on
he
shot
out
into
space
and
vanished
as
though
some
unseen
hand
had
lifted
up
from
these
dark
depths
and
plucked
him
down
to
annihilation
the
young
girl
shrieked
again
the
woman
gave
a
gasp
of
horror
duchemin
himself
knew
a
sickish
qualm
but
he
had
no
time
to
spare
for
that
it
was
going
ill
with
the
man
contending
against
two
the
adventurer
stick
might
have
been
bewitched
that
night
so
magical
was
its
work
a
single
blow
on
the
nearest
head
but
believe
it
was
selected
with
care
and
instantaneously
that
knot
of
contention
was
resolved
into
its
three
several
parts
the
smitten
clapped
hands
to
his
hurt
moaning
his
brother
scoundrel
started
back
with
staring
eyes
in
which
rage
gave
place
to
dismay
as
he
grasped
the
change
in
the
situation
and
saw
the
stick
swinging
for
his
head
in
turn
he
ducked
neatly
the
stick
whistled
through
thin
air
and
before
duchemin
could
recover
the
other
had
turned
and
was
running
for
dear
life
duchemin
delayed
a
bare
instant
but
manifestly
his
assistance
was
no
more
needed
here
in
a
breath
he
who
had
been
so
recently
outmatched
recollected
his
wits
and
took
the
initiative
with
admirable
address
duchemin
saw
him
fly
furiously
at
his
late
opponent
trip
and
lay
him
on
his
back
then
turned
and
gave
chase
to
the
fugitive
this
was
the
masquerader
in
the
american
uniform
and
an
amazingly
fleet
pair
of
heels
he
showed
taking
into
account
his
heaviness
of
body
already
he
had
a
fair
lead
and
had
he
maintained
for
long
the
pace
he
set
in
the
first
few
hundred
yards
he
must
have
won
away
but
whether
he
lacked
staying
powers
or
confidence
he
made
the
mistake
of
adopting
another
and
less
fatiguing
means
of
locomotion
duchemin
saw
him
swerve
from
his
first
course
and
steer
for
a
vehicle
standing
at
some
distance
evidently
the
conveyance
which
had
brought
the
sightseers
to
view
the
spectacle
of
by
moonlight
waiting
in
the
middle
of
a
broad
avenue
of
misshapen
obelisks
a
dilapidated
barouche
with
a
low
body
sagging
the
lower
for
debilitated
springs
on
either
side
its
pole
drooped
two
sorry
specimens
of
crowbait
and
their
pained
amazement
was
so
unfeigned
that
duchemin
laughed
aloud
when
the
fat
rogue
bounded
to
the
box
snatched
up
reins
and
whip
and
curled
a
cruel
lash
round
their
bony
flanks
from
this
one
inferred
that
he
was
indifferently
acquainted
with
the
animals
certainly
not
their
accustomed
driver
and
since
it
took
them
some
moments
to
come
to
their
senses
and
appreciate
that
all
this
was
not
an
evil
dream
duchemin
hands
were
clutching
for
the
back
of
the
carriage
when
the
horses
broke
suddenly
into
an
awkward
lumbering
gallop
and
whisked
it
out
of
reach
but
not
for
long
extending
himself
duchemin
caught
the
folded
top
jumped
and
began
to
clamber
in
the
man
on
the
box
was
tugging
fretfully
at
something
wedged
in
the
of
his
breeches
proof
enough
that
he
was
not
the
original
tenant
of
the
uniform
since
it
fitted
too
snugly
to
permit
ready
extraction
of
a
pistol
in
an
emergency
but
he
got
no
chance
whatever
to
use
the
weapon
for
the
moment
duchemin
found
his
own
feet
in
the
swaying
vehicle
he
leaped
on
the
shoulders
of
the
other
and
dragged
him
backwards
from
the
box
what
followed
was
not
very
clear
to
him
a
mélange
of
impressions
the
fought
like
a
devil
unchained
cursing
duchemin
fluently
in
the
purest
and
foulest
argot
of
belleville
which
is
not
in
the
french
vocabulary
of
the
doughboy
the
animals
at
the
pole
caught
fire
of
this
madness
and
ran
away
in
good
earnest
that
wretched
barouche
rolled
and
pitched
like
a
rudderless
shell
in
a
crazy
sea
the
two
men
floundered
in
its
well
like
fish
in
a
pail
they
fought
by
no
rules
with
no
science
but
bit
and
kicked
and
gouged
and
wrenched
and
struck
as
occasion
offered
and
each
to
the
best
of
his
ability
duchemin
caught
glimpses
of
a
face
like
a
chinese
hideously
distorted
with
working
features
and
disfigured
with
smears
of
soot
through
which
insane
eyeballs
rolled
and
glared
in
the
moonlight
then
a
hand
like
a
vice
gripped
his
windpipe
he
was
on
his
back
his
head
overhanging
the
edge
of
the
floor
a
thumb
was
feeling
for
one
of
his
eyes
yet
it
could
not
have
been
much
later
when
he
and
his
opponent
were
standing
and
swaying
as
one
locked
in
an
embrace
of
wrestlers
still
duchemin
knew
as
many
tricks
of
fighting
as
the
other
perhaps
a
few
more
and
then
he
was
no
doubt
in
far
better
condition
at
all
events
the
fellow
was
presently
at
his
mercy
in
a
hold
that
gave
one
the
privilege
of
breaking
his
back
at
will
a
man
of
mistaken
scruples
duchemin
failed
to
do
so
but
held
the
other
helpless
only
long
enough
to
find
his
and
rip
out
the
pistol
a
deadly
luger
then
a
thrust
and
a
kick
which
he
enjoyed
infinitely
sent
the
brute
spinning
out
to
land
on
his
head
the
fall
should
have
broken
his
neck
at
the
worst
it
should
have
stunned
him
evidently
it
did
when
duchemin
had
scrambled
up
to
the
box
captured
the
reins
and
brought
the
nags
to
a
stop
no
great
feat
that
they
were
quite
sated
with
the
voluptuousness
of
running
away
and
well
content
to
heed
the
hand
and
voice
of
authority
and
when
finally
he
swung
them
round
and
drove
back
toward
the
cirque
he
saw
no
sign
of
his
apache
by
the
roadside
so
he
congratulated
himself
on
the
forethought
which
had
possessed
him
of
the
pistol
otherwise
the
assassin
since
he
had
retained
sufficient
wit
and
strength
to
crawl
into
hiding
could
and
assuredly
would
have
potted
monsieur
duchemin
with
neither
difficulty
nor
compunction
not
five
figures
but
four
only
were
waiting
beside
the
cirque
when
wheeling
the
barouche
as
near
the
group
as
the
lay
of
the
ground
permitted
he
climbed
down
a
man
lay
at
length
in
the
coarse
grass
his
head
pillowed
in
the
lap
of
one
woman
another
woman
stood
aside
trembling
and
wringing
aged
hands
the
third
knelt
beside
the
supine
man
but
rose
quickly
as
duchemin
drew
near
and
came
to
meet
him
in
this
one
he
recognised
her
to
whose
salvation
chance
had
first
led
him
and
now
found
time
to
appreciate
a
face
of
pallid
loveliness
intelligent
and
composed
while
she
addressed
him
quietly
and
directly
to
the
point
in
a
voice
whose
timbre
was
he
fancied
out
of
character
with
the
excellent
accent
of
its
french
an
exquisite
voice
nevertheless
english
he
guessed
or
possibly
american
but
much
at
home
in
france
monsieur
has
been
wounded
a
knife
thrust
it
will
be
necessary
to
get
him
to
a
surgeon
as
quickly
as
possible
i
fancy
there
will
be
none
nearer
than
nant
do
you
know
the
way
one
can
doubtless
find
it
said
duchemin
modestly
but
i
myself
am
not
without
knowledge
of
wounds
perhaps
if
monsieur
would
be
so
good
duchemin
knelt
beside
the
man
who
welcomed
him
with
open
eyes
and
a
wry
smile
that
was
almost
as
faint
as
his
voice
it
is
nothing
monsieur
a
clean
cut
in
the
arm
with
some
loss
of
blood
but
let
me
see
the
young
girl
in
whose
lap
rested
the
head
of
monsieur
sat
back
and
watched
duchemin
with
curious
grave
eyes
in
which
traces
of
moisture
glimmered
had
the
animal
at
my
mercy
i
thought
apologised
when
suddenly
he
drew
that
knife
stuck
me
and
broke
away
i
understand
duchemin
replied
but
do
talk
you
want
all
your
strength
my
friend
with
his
he
laid
open
the
sodden
sleeves
of
coat
and
shirt
exposing
an
upper
arm
stained
dark
with
blood
that
welled
in
ugly
jets
from
a
cut
both
wide
and
deep
artery
severed
he
announced
and
straightened
up
and
looked
about
at
a
loss
my
pack
one
actions
in
moments
of
excitement
are
apt
to
be
largely
directed
by
the
subconscious
he
knew
still
he
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
he
could
unwittingly
have
unshipped
and
dropped
his
rucksack
while
making
ready
to
pursue
the
american
uniform
nevertheless
it
seemed
that
was
just
what
he
had
done
the
woman
who
had
spoken
to
him
found
and
fetched
it
from
no
great
distance
and
its
contents
enabled
duchemin
to
improvise
a
tourniquet
and
when
the
flow
of
blood
was
checked
a
bandage
during
the
operation
unostentatiously
fainted
the
young
girl
caught
her
breath
a
fluttering
hiss
do
be
alarmed
mademoiselle
duchemin
soothed
her
he
will
come
round
presently
he
will
do
splendidly
now
till
we
get
him
to
bed
and
then
his
convalescence
will
be
merely
the
matter
of
a
while
of
rest
he
slipped
his
arms
beneath
the
unconscious
man
gathered
him
up
bodily
and
bore
him
to
the
carriage
and
thanks
to
man
amusing
amour
propre
made
far
less
of
the
effort
than
it
cost
him
then
with
disposed
as
comfortably
as
might
be
on
the
back
seat
once
again
pillowed
in
a
fashion
to
make
any
man
envious
duchemin
turned
to
find
the
other
women
at
his
elbow
to
the
eldest
he
offered
a
bow
suited
to
her
condition
and
a
hand
to
help
her
into
the
barouche
madame
her
agitation
had
measurably
subsided
the
gentle
inclination
of
the
aged
head
which
acknowledged
his
courtesy
was
as
eloquent
of
her
quality
as
he
found
the
name
which
she
gave
him
in
quavering
accents
madame
de
sévénié
monsieur
with
madame
permission
i
am
andré
duchemin
monsieur
duchemin
has
placed
us
all
deeply
in
his
debt
louise
the
girl
in
the
carriage
looked
up
and
bowed
murmuring
mademoiselle
de
montalais
monsieur
my
granddaughter
and
eve
she
turned
to
the
third
to
her
whose
voice
of
delightful
accent
was
not
in
duchemin
notion
wholly
french
madame
de
montalais
my
daughter
by
adoption
widow
of
my
grandson
who
died
gloriously
for
his
country
at
la
iv
eve
when
she
had
graciously
permitted
duchemin
to
assist
her
to
a
place
in
the
carriage
madame
sévénié
turned
immediately
to
comfort
her
granddaughter
it
was
easy
to
divine
an
attachment
there
between
and
louise
de
montalais
duchemin
fancied
and
as
it
turned
out
rightly
the
two
were
betrothed
but
madame
de
montalais
was
claiming
his
attention
monsieur
thinks
she
enquired
in
a
guarded
tone
taking
advantage
of
the
diversion
provided
by
the
elder
lady
to
delay
a
little
before
entering
the
barouche
monsieur
is
in
no
immediate
danger
still
the
services
of
a
good
surgeon
as
soon
as
may
be
will
it
be
dangerous
to
wait
till
we
get
to
nant
how
far
is
that
madame
twelve
miles
duchemin
looked
aside
at
the
decrepit
conveyance
with
its
unhappy
horses
and
summed
up
a
conclusion
in
a
shrug
millau
is
nearer
is
it
not
madame
but
nant
is
not
far
from
the
château
de
montalais
and
at
la
our
automobile
is
waiting
less
than
two
miles
below
the
chauffeur
advised
against
bringing
over
the
road
from
la
roque
to
montpellier
it
is
too
rough
and
very
steep
oh
said
duchemin
as
one
who
catches
a
glimmering
of
light
pardon
monsieur
madame
chauffeur
is
waiting
with
the
automobile
no
doubt
but
assuredly
monsieur
he
recollected
himself
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
then
at
la
roque
with
an
automobile
at
your
disposal
nant
is
little
more
distant
than
millau
certainly
nevertheless
let
us
not
delay
monsieur
is
too
good
momentarily
a
hand
slender
and
firm
and
cool
rested
in
his
own
then
its
owner
was
setting
into
place
beside
madame
de
sévénié
and
duchemin
clambering
up
to
his
on
the
box
the
road
proved
quite
as
rough
and
declivitous
as
its
reputation
one
surmised
that
the
spring
rains
had
found
it
in
a
bad
way
and
done
nothing
to
better
its
condition
deep
ruts
and
a
liberal
sprinkling
of
small
boulders
collaborated
to
keep
the
horses
stumbling
plunging
and
pitching
as
they
strained
back
against
the
singletrees
duchemin
was
grateful
for
the
moonlight
which
alone
enabled
him
to
keep
the
road
and
avoid
the
worst
of
the
going
until
he
remembered
that
without
the
moon
there
would
have
been
no
expedition
that
night
to
view
the
mock
ruins
of
montpellier
by
its
unearthly
light
and
consequently
no
adventure
to
entangle
him
upon
this
reflection
he
swore
softly
but
most
fervently
into
his
becoming
beard
he
was
well
fed
up
with
adventures
thank
you
and
could
have
done
very
well
without
this
latest
and
especially
at
a
time
when
he
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
permitted
to
remain
the
footloose
wanderer
in
a
strange
land
a
bird
of
passage
without
ties
or
responsibilities
he
thought
it
devilish
hard
that
one
may
never
do
a
service
to
another
without
incurring
a
burden
of
irksome
obligations
to
the
served
that
bonds
of
interest
forged
in
moments
of
unpremeditated
and
generous
impulse
are
never
readily
to
be
broken
now
because
chance
had
seen
fit
to
put
him
in
the
way
of
saving
a
hapless
party
of
sightseers
from
robbery
or
worse
he
found
himself
hopelessly
committed
to
take
a
continuing
interest
in
them
it
appeared
that
their
home
was
a
château
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
nant
well
after
their
shocking
experience
and
with
the
wounded
man
on
their
hands
and
especially
if
la
told
the
story
one
confidently
expected
duchemin
could
hardly
avoid
offering
to
see
them
safely
as
far
as
nant
and
once
there
he
would
be
definitely
in
the
toils
he
would
have
to
stop
in
the
town
overnight
and
in
the
morning
he
would
be
able
neither
in
common
decency
to
slip
away
without
calling
to
enquire
after
the
welfare
of
and
the
tranquillity
of
the
ladies
nor
in
discretion
to
take
himself
out
of
the
way
of
the
civil
investigation
which
would
inevitably
follow
the
report
of
what
had
happened
in
montpelier
no
having
despatched
a
bandit
to
an
end
it
now
devolved
upon
andré
duchemin
to
satisfy
society
and
the
state
that
he
had
done
so
only
with
the
most
amiable
motives
on
due
provocation
to
save
his
own
life
and
possibly
the
lives
of
others
he
had
premonitions
of
endless
delays
while
provincial
authorities
wondered
doubted
criticised
procrastinated
investigated
reported
and
repeated
and
then
there
was
every
chance
that
the
story
thanks
to
the
prominence
of
the
persons
involved
for
one
made
no
doubt
that
the
names
of
sévénié
and
montalais
and
ranked
high
in
that
part
of
the
world
the
story
would
get
into
the
newspapers
of
the
larger
towns
in
the
department
and
what
then
of
the
comfortable
pseudonymity
of
andré
duchemin
posed
in
an
inescapable
glare
of
publicity
how
long
might
he
hope
to
escape
recognition
by
some
acquaintance
friend
or
enemy
heaven
knew
he
had
enough
of
both
sorts
scattered
widely
over
the
face
of
europe
it
seemed
hard
indeed
but
it
was
of
course
he
assured
himself
grimly
all
a
matter
of
fatality
with
him
never
for
him
the
slippered
ease
of
middle
age
the
pursuit
of
bourgeois
virtues
of
which
he
had
so
fondly
dreamed
in
meyrueis
adventures
were
his
portion
as
surely
as
humdrum
and
eventless
days
were
many
another
wars
might
come
and
wars
might
go
but
his
mere
presence
in
its
neighbourhood
would
prove
enough
to
turn
the
palace
of
peace
itself
into
action
front
or
so
it
seemed
to
him
in
the
bitterness
of
his
spirit
nor
would
he
for
an
instant
grant
that
his
lot
was
not
without
its
own
peculiar
compensations
at
la
roque
a
tiny
hamlet
huddled
in
the
shadow
of
montpellier
and
living
almost
exclusively
upon
the
tourists
that
pass
that
way
it
was
as
duchemin
had
foreseen
remembering
the
american
uniform
and
the
face
smudged
with
soot
that
favourite
device
of
the
french
criminal
of
the
lower
class
fearing
recognition
for
there
it
appeared
that
whereas
the
motor
car
was
waiting
safe
and
sound
enough
its
chauffeur
had
vanished
into
thin
air
not
a
soul
could
be
found
who
recalled
seeing
the
man
after
the
barouche
tiad
left
the
village
whereupon
duchemin
asked
whether
the
chauffeur
had
been
a
stout
man
and
being
informed
that
it
was
so
considered
the
case
complete
mesdames
de
sévénié
et
de
montalais
he
suggested
might
as
well
then
and
there
give
up
all
hope
of
ever
again
seeing
that
particular
chauffeur
unless
by
some
mischance
entirely
out
of
the
reckoning
of
the
latter
the
landlord
of
the
auberge
a
surly
sot
who
had
supplied
the
barouche
with
the
man
to
act
as
driver
and
guide
in
one
took
with
ill
grace
the
charge
that
his
employee
had
been
in
league
with
the
bandits
but
this
was
true
on
the
word
of
madame
de
montalais
it
was
their
guide
she
said
whom
duchemin
had
driven
over
the
cliff
and
as
duchemin
had
anticipated
her
name
alone
proved
enough
to
silence
the
landlord
virtuous
protestations
one
could
not
always
avoid
being
deceived
he
declared
he
knew
nothing
of
the
dead
man
more
than
that
he
had
come
well
recommended
with
which
he
said
no
more
but
lent
an
efficient
if
sullen
hand
to
the
task
of
transferring
to
the
motor
car
came
to
while
this
was
being
accomplished
begged
feebly
for
water
was
given
it
with
a
little
brandy
to
boot
and
comfortably
settled
in
the
rear
seat
between
louise
de
montalais
and
her
grandmother
relapsed
once
more
into
unconsciousness
learning
that
madame
de
montalais
would
drive
duchemin
dissembled
a
sigh
of
relief
and
standing
beside
the
car
doffed
his
cap
to
say
he
was
only
too
happy
to
have
been
of
such
slight
service
as
the
circumstances
had
permitted
and
if
at
any
time
he
could
do
more
a
line
addressed
to
him
at
nimes
poste
restante
but
if
monsieur
duchemin
would
be
good
enough
madame
de
sévénié
interposed
in
a
fretful
quaver
and
if
it
would
not
be
taking
him
too
far
out
of
his
way
it
is
night
anything
may
happen
the
car
might
break
down
and
i
am
an
old
woman
monsieur
with
sorely
tried
nerves
looking
down
at
him
from
her
place
at
the
wheel
madame
de
montalais
added
it
would
be
an
act
of
charity
i
think
monsieur
if
it
does
not
inconvenience
you
too
greatly
on
the
contrary
he
fabricated
without
blushing
you
will
be
obliging
a
weary
man
by
putting
him
several
miles
on
his
way
he
had
no
cause
to
regret
his
complaisance
seated
beside
madame
de
montalais
he
watched
her
operate
the
car
with
skilful
hands
making
the
best
of
a
highway
none
too
good
if
a
city
boulevard
in
comparison
with
that
which
they
had
covered
in
the
barouche
following
the
meandering
dourbie
it
ran
snakily
from
patches
of
staring
moonlight
to
patches
of
inky
shadows
now
on
narrow
ledges
high
over
the
brawling
stream
now
dipping
so
low
that
the
tyres
were
almost
level
with
the
plane
of
broken
waters
the
sweep
of
night
air
in
his
face
was
sweet
and
smooth
not
cold
for
a
marvel
in
that
altitude
and
stroked
his
eyelids
with
touches
as
bland
as
caresses
of
a
pretty
woman
fingers
he
was
sensible
of
drowsiness
a
surrender
to
fatigue
to
which
the
motion
of
the
motor
car
swung
seemingly
on
velvet
springs
and
the
shifting
blending
chiaroscuro
of
the
magic
night
were
likewise
conducive
so
that
there
came
a
lessening
of
the
tension
of
resentment
in
his
humour
it
was
true
that
life
would
never
let
him
rest
in
the
quiet
byways
of
his
desire
but
after
all
unrest
was
life
and
it
was
good
to
be
alive
tonight
alive
and
weary
and
not
with
self
in
a
motor
car
swinging
swiftly
and
silently
along
a
river
road
in
the
hills
of
southern
france
with
a
woman
lovely
soignée
and
mysterious
at
the
wheel
perhaps
instinctively
sensible
of
the
regard
that
dwelt
warm
with
wonder
on
the
fair
curve
of
her
cheek
the
perfect
modelling
of
her
nose
and
mouth
she
looked
swiftly
askance
after
a
time
surprised
his
admiration
and
as
if
not
displeased
smiled
faintly
as
she
returned
attention
to
the
road
duchemin
was
conscious
of
something
like
a
shock
of
emotion
a
sudden
surging
of
some
hunger
that
had
long
lain
dormant
in
his
being
unsuspected
how
long
he
could
not
surmise
gaining
strength
in
latency
waiting
to
be
awakened
and
set
free
by
one
careless
sidelong
look
and
smile
of
a
strange
woman
eve
he
whispered
unheard
eve
de
montalais
then
of
a
sudden
he
caught
himself
up
sharply
it
was
natural
enough
that
one
should
be
susceptible
to
gentler
impulses
at
such
a
time
under
circumstances
so
strange
so
unforeseen
so
romantic
but
he
must
not
dared
not
would
not
yield
that
way
danger
lay
not
that
he
feared
danger
for
like
most
of
mankind
he
loved
it
well
but
here
the
danger
held
potentialities
if
not
the
certainty
of
pain
pain
it
might
be
not
for
one
alone
besides
it
was
too
absurd
v
phinuit
co
in
the
upshot
however
the
necessity
of
his
dismal
forebodings
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
length
of
time
devoted
by
monsieur
duchemin
to
kicking
idle
heels
in
the
town
of
nant
where
the
civil
authorities
proved
considerate
in
a
degree
that
even
making
allowance
for
the
local
prestige
of
the
house
of
montalais
gratified
and
surprised
the
confirmed
parisian
for
that
was
just
what
the
good
man
was
at
heart
and
would
be
till
he
died
the
form
in
which
environment
of
younger
years
had
moulded
him
less
french
than
parisian
sharing
the
almost
insular
ignorance
of
life
in
the
provinces
characteristic
of
the
native
boulevardier
to
whom
the
sun
is
truly
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
spotlight
focussed
exclusively
on
paris
leaving
the
rest
of
france
in
a
sort
of
crepuscular
gloom
the
world
besides
steeped
in
eternal
night
the
of
la
roque
turned
out
to
have
been
a
scamp
well
and
to
the
gendarmerie
the
wound
sustained
by
monsieur
bore
testimony
to
the
gravity
of
the
affair
amply
excusing
duchemin
interference
and
its
fatal
sequel
while
the
statements
of
mesdames
de
sévénié
et
de
montalais
duly
becoming
public
property
bade
fair
to
exalt
the
local
reputation
of
andré
duchemin
to
heroic
stature
and
naturally
his
papers
were
unimpeachable
so
that
he
found
himself
before
his
acquaintance
with
nant
was
hours
of
age
free
once
more
to
humour
the
dictates
of
his
own
sweet
will
to
go
on
to
nimes
his
professed
objective
or
to
the
devil
if
he
liked
a
freedom
which
consistent
with
the
native
inconsistency
of
man
he
exercised
by
electing
to
stop
over
in
nant
for
another
day
or
two
at
least
assuring
himself
that
he
found
the
town
altogether
charming
more
so
even
than
meyrueis
and
sometimes
believing
this
fiction
for
as
much
as
twenty
minutes
at
a
stretch
besides
the
weather
was
unsettled
the
inn
which
went
by
the
unpretending
style
of
the
grand
hôtel
de
he
found
clean
comfortable
and
as
to
its
cuisine
praiseworthy
the
windows
of
the
cubicle
in
which
he
had
been
lodged
one
of
ten
which
sufficed
for
the
demands
of
the
itinerant
universe
not
only
overlooked
the
public
square
and
its
amusing
life
of
a
minor
market
town
but
commanded
as
well
a
splendid
vista
of
the
valley
of
the
dourbie
with
its
piquant
contrast
of
luxuriant
alluvial
verdure
and
grim
scarps
of
rock
that
ran
up
on
either
side
the
wanton
glimmering
river
into
two
opposed
and
overshadowing
pinnacles
of
crag
the
roc
nantais
and
the
roc
de
saint
alban
peaks
each
a
rendezvous
just
then
for
hosts
of
cloud
that
scowled
forbiddingly
down
upon
the
peaceful
valley
moreover
even
from
the
terrasse
of
the
café
below
one
needed
only
to
lift
one
eyes
to
see
afar
perched
high
upon
a
smiling
slope
of
green
with
the
highway
to
millau
at
its
foot
and
a
beetling
cliff
behind
the
château
de
montalais
seated
on
that
terrasse
late
in
the
afternoon
of
his
second
day
in
nant
discussing
a
picon
and
a
villainous
caporal
cigarette
of
the
régie
to
whose
products
a
rugged
constitution
was
growing
slowly
reconciled
anew
duchemin
let
his
vision
dwell
upon
the
distant
château
almost
as
constantly
as
his
thoughts
he
was
to
dine
there
that
very
evening
even
taking
into
account
the
signal
service
duchemin
had
rendered
this
was
easy
to
believe
when
one
remembered
the
tradition
of
social
conservatism
among
french
gentlefolk
still
it
was
true
duchemin
of
the
open
road
was
bidden
to
dine
en
famille
at
the
château
de
montalais
in
his
pocket
lay
the
invitation
penned
in
the
crabbed
antique
hand
of
madame
de
sévénié
and
fetched
to
the
hotel
by
a
servitor
quite
as
crabbed
and
antique
monsieur
duchemin
would
confer
a
true
pleasure
by
enabling
the
ladies
of
the
château
to
testify
even
so
inadequately
to
their
sense
of
obligation
etc
with
a
postscript
to
say
that
monsieur
was
resting
easily
his
wound
mending
as
rapidly
as
heart
could
wish
of
course
duchemin
was
going
had
in
fact
already
despatched
his
acceptance
by
the
hand
of
the
same
messenger
equally
of
course
he
knew
that
he
ought
not
to
go
for
a
man
of
his
years
he
was
as
a
matter
of
training
and
habit
amazingly
honest
with
himself
he
knew
quite
well
what
bent
his
inclination
toward
visiting
the
château
de
montalais
just
once
before
effecting
what
he
was
resolved
upon
a
complete
evanishment
from
the
ken
of
its
people
he
had
yet
to
hold
one
minute
of
private
conversation
with
eve
de
montalais
he
had
of
her
no
sign
to
warrant
his
thinking
her
anything
but
utterly
indifferent
to
him
and
yet
no
he
was
ass
enough
to
dream
that
he
was
in
love
with
the
woman
to
the
contrary
he
was
wise
enough
knew
himself
well
enough
to
know
that
he
could
be
easily
and
would
be
given
half
a
chance
to
lose
his
head
his
warning
had
been
clear
beyond
mistake
in
that
hour
in
the
motor
car
on
the
road
from
la
roque
to
nant
when
nature
as
she
sometimes
will
incautiously
had
shown
her
hand
to
one
whom
she
herself
had
schooled
to
read
shrewdly
letting
him
discern
what
was
her
will
with
him
the
snare
that
was
laid
for
his
feet
and
in
which
he
must
soon
find
himself
trapped
beyond
extrication
always
providing
he
lacked
the
wit
and
resolution
to
fly
his
peril
who
knew
through
bitterest
of
learning
that
love
was
never
for
him
now
he
had
seen
madame
de
montalais
another
time
and
had
found
that
she
fitted
to
the
sweetest
detail
of
perfection
his
ideal
of
woman
on
the
previous
afternoon
meeting
the
ladies
of
the
château
by
arrangement
in
the
bureau
of
the
maire
duchemin
had
sat
opposite
and
watched
and
listened
to
eve
de
montalais
for
upwards
of
two
hours
as
completely
devoted
to
covert
study
of
her
as
if
she
had
been
the
one
woman
in
the
room
as
if
the
girl
louise
madame
de
sévénié
and
the
officials
and
functionaries
of
nant
had
not
existed
in
the
same
world
with
her
and
in
that
tedious
and
constrained
time
of
formalities
he
had
learned
much
about
her
but
first
of
all
thanks
to
the
uncompromising
light
of
day
that
filled
the
cheerless
room
that
moonlight
had
not
enhanced
but
rather
tempered
the
charms
of
person
which
had
the
night
before
so
stirred
his
pulses
posed
with
consummate
grace
in
a
comfortless
chair
a
figure
of
slender
elegance
in
her
she
had
narrated
quietly
her
version
of
last
night
misadventure
an
occasional
tremor
of
humour
lightening
the
moving
modulations
of
her
voice
a
deep
and
vibrant
voice
contralto
in
quality
hinting
at
hidden
treasures
of
strength
in
the
woman
whose
superficial
mind
it
expressed
a
fair
woman
slim
but
round
with
brown
eyes
level
and
calm
a
translucent
skin
of
matchless
texture
hair
the
hue
of
bronze
laced
with
intimations
of
gold
her
story
told
and
taken
down
in
longhand
by
a
withered
clerk
she
supplied
without
reluctance
or
trace
of
embarrassment
such
intimate
personal
information
as
was
necessary
in
order
that
her
signature
to
the
document
might
be
acceptable
to
the
state
her
age
she
said
was
her
birthplace
the
city
of
new
york
her
parents
edmund
anstruther
once
of
bath
england
but
at
the
time
of
her
birth
a
naturalised
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
eve
marie
anstruther
née
legendre
of
paris
both
were
dead
in
june
she
had
married
in
paris
victor
maurice
de
montalais
who
had
been
killed
in
action
at
la
on
the
ninth
of
september
following
her
home
the
château
de
montalais
on
the
hand
she
stripped
in
order
to
sign
her
deposition
duchemin
saw
a
blue
diamond
of
such
superb
water
that
this
amateur
of
precious
stones
caught
his
breath
for
sheer
wonder
at
its
beauty
and
excellence
and
worth
such
jewels
he
knew
were
few
and
far
to
seek
outside
the
collections
of
princes
out
of
these
simple
elements
imagination
reconstructed
a
tragedy
a
tragedy
of
life
singularly
close
to
the
truth
as
he
later
came
to
learn
it
a
story
not
at
all
calculated
to
lessen
his
interest
in
the
woman
such
women
he
knew
are
the
product
of
a
cultivation
seldom
to
be
achieved
by
poverty
this
one
had
been
made
before
and
not
by
her
marriage
her
father
then
had
commanded
riches
and
when
one
knew
as
duchemin
knew
what
delights
new
york
has
for
young
women
of
wealth
and
fashion
one
perceived
a
radiant
and
background
for
this
drab
life
of
a
recluse
expatriate
from
the
high
world
of
her
inheritance
which
eve
de
montalais
must
lead
and
for
the
six
years
of
her
premature
widowhood
must
have
led
in
that
lonely
château
buried
deep
in
the
loneliest
hills
of
all
france
the
sole
companion
and
comfort
of
her
husband
bereaved
sister
and
grandmother
chained
by
sorrow
to
their
sorrow
by
an
inexorable
reluctance
to
give
them
pain
by
seeming
to
slight
the
memory
of
the
husband
brother
and
grandson
through
turning
her
face
toward
the
world
of
life
and
light
and
gaiety
of
which
she
was
so
essentially
a
part
isolate
from
which
she
was
so
inevitably
a
thing
existing
without
purpose
or
effect
how
often
duchemin
wondered
had
she
in
hours
of
solitude
and
restlessness
felt
her
spirit
yearning
toward
paris
the
nearest
gateway
to
her
world
and
had
cried
out
how
long
o
lord
how
long
the
mellow
resonance
of
a
automobile
horn
disturbing
the
early
evening
hush
and
at
the
same
time
duchemin
meditations
recalled
him
to
nant
in
time
to
see
a
touring
car
of
majestic
proportions
and
mien
which
coming
from
the
south
from
the
direction
of
the
railroad
and
nimes
was
sweeping
a
fine
curve
round
two
sides
of
the
public
square
arriving
in
front
of
the
hôtel
de
it
executed
a
full
stop
and
stood
curbed
yet
palpitant
purring
heavily
an
impressive
brute
of
a
car
all
shining
silver
plate
and
lustrous
green
paint
and
gold
the
newest
model
of
the
costliest
and
best
automobile
manufactured
in
france
instantly
as
the
wheels
ceased
to
turn
a
young
man
in
the
smartest
livery
imaginable
green
garnished
with
gold
leaped
smartly
from
the
driver
seat
with
military
precision
opened
the
door
of
the
tonneau
and
holding
it
immobilised
himself
into
the
semblance
of
a
waxwork
image
with
the
dispassionate
eye
the
firm
mouth
and
the
closely
razored
square
jowls
of
the
model
chauffeur
rustics
and
townsfolk
were
already
gathering
a
gaping
audience
when
from
the
tonneau
descended
first
a
long
and
painfully
emaciated
gentleman
whose
face
was
a
cadaverous
mask
of
settled
melancholy
and
his
chosen
toilette
for
motoring
as
might
be
seen
through
the
open
and
flapping
front
of
his
ulster
a
tightly
tailored
light
grey
cutaway
coat
and
trousers
with
a
white
waistcoat
a
black
satin
ascot
scarf
transfixed
by
a
single
splendid
pearl
and
spotless
white
spats
his
hand
as
gaunt
as
a
skeleton
assisted
to
alight
a
young
woman
whose
brilliant
blonde
beauty
viewed
for
the
first
time
in
evening
shadows
was
like
a
shaft
of
sunlight
in
a
darkened
room
a
creature
becomingly
and
modishly
gowned
for
motoring
spirited
yet
dignified
in
carriage
she
was
like
a
vision
of
as
she
was
palpably
a
visitation
from
the
rue
de
la
paix
following
her
a
third
passenger
presented
the
indeed
rotund
person
of
a
frenchman
of
thirty
devoted
to
le
sport
as
witness
his
aggressively
english
tweeds
and
the
single
glass
screwed
into
his
right
his
face
was
chubby
pink
and
white
his
look
was
merry
he
was
magnificently
and
débonnaire
like
shapes
from
some
superbly
costumed
pageant
of
high
life
in
the
twentieth
century
this
trio
drifted
rather
than
merely
walked
like
mortals
across
the
terrasse
and
into
the
café
de
which
seemed
suddenly
to
shrink
in
proportion
as
if
reminded
of
its
comparative
insignificance
in
the
scheme
of
things
where
an
awed
staff
of
waiters
led
by
the
overpowered
propriétaires
monsieur
et
madame
themselves
welcomed
these
apparitions
from
another
and
a
better
world
with
bowings
and
scrapings
and
a
vast
bustle
and
movement
of
chairs
and
tables
while
all
nant
all
of
it
that
is
that
was
accustomed
to
foregather
in
the
café
at
this
the
hour
of
the
aperitif
looked
on
with
awed
and
envious
eyes
it
was
all
very
theatrical
and
inspiring
to
monsieur
duchemin
too
who
lost
in
the
shuffle
of
nant
and
content
to
be
so
murmured
to
himself
that
serviceable
and
comforting
word
of
the
time
profiteers
and
contemplated
with
some
satisfaction
his
personal
superiority
to
such
as
these
but
there
was
more
and
better
to
come
there
remained
in
the
car
a
mere
average
man
undistinguished
but
by
a
lack
of
especial
distinction
sober
of
habit
economical
of
gesture
dressed
in
a
simple
lounge
suit
such
as
anybody
might
wear
beneath
a
rough
and
motorcoat
when
the
car
stopped
he
had
stood
up
in
his
place
beside
the
chauffeur
as
if
meaning
to
get
out
but
rather
remained
motionless
resting
a
hand
on
the
windshield
and
thoughtfully
gazing
northwards
along
the
road
that
skirting
the
grounds
of
the
château
de
montalais
disappeared
from
view
round
the
sleek
shoulder
of
a
hill
now
as
the
pattern
chauffeur
shut
the
door
to
the
tonneau
with
the
properly
arrogant
slam
the
man
who
lingered
in
the
car
nodded
gravely
to
some
private
thought
unlatched
the
door
got
down
and
turned
toward
the
café
but
before
following
his
companions
of
more
brilliant
plumage
paused
for
a
quiet
word
with
the
chauffeur
we
dine
here
jules
he
announced
in
english
settling
into
place
behind
the
wheel
jules
saluted
with
fine
finish
and
deference
very
good
phinuit
sir
he
said
meekly
in
the
same
tongue
to
this
he
added
coolly
without
the
least
flicker
of
a
glance
aside
without
moving
one
muscle
other
than
those
involved
by
the
act
of
speech
and
in
precisely
the
tone
of
respect
that
became
his
livery
what
the
awful
idea
you
big
stiff
phinuit
betrayed
not
the
slightest
sense
of
anything
untoward
in
this
mode
of
address
but
looked
round
to
the
chauffeur
with
a
slow
not
unfriendly
smile
why
he
said
pleasantly
you
misbegotten
garage
hound
why
do
you
ask
in
the
same
manner
jules
replied
ca
you
see
it
going
to
rain
phinuit
cocked
a
calm
observant
eye
heavenwards
involuntarily
but
unobtrusively
under
cover
of
the
little
tubbed
trees
that
hedged
the
terrasse
apart
from
the
square
duchemin
did
likewise
and
so
discovered
or
for
the
first
time
appreciated
the
cause
of
the
uncommonly
early
dusk
that
loured
over
nant
between
the
sentinel
peaks
that
towered
above
the
valley
black
battalions
of
storm
cloud
were
fraternising
joining
forces
coalescing
into
a
vast
and
formidable
army
of
ominous
aspect
so
it
is
phinuit
commented
amiably
indeed
not
without
a
certain
hint
of
satisfaction
blessed
if
you
do
see
everything
well
then
what
about
it
why
should
say
you
better
find
a
place
to
put
the
car
under
cover
in
case
it
comes
on
to
storm
before
we
finished
and
put
up
the
top
you
do
mean
to
go
on
in
the
rain
jules
protested
yet
studiously
in
no
tone
of
protest
but
naturally
how
do
you
get
that
way
do
you
want
us
all
to
get
soaked
to
our
skins
my
dear
jules
phinuit
returned
with
a
winning
smile
i
give
a
tupenny
damn
if
we
do
with
that
he
went
to
join
his
company
while
jules
once
the
other
back
was
turned
permitted
himself
for
the
sake
of
his
own
respect
and
the
effect
upon
the
assembled
audience
the
luxury
of
a
shrug
that
outrivalled
words
in
expression
of
his
personal
opinion
of
the
madness
that
contemplated
further
travel
on
such
a
night
as
this
promised
to
be
then
like
the
servant
that
he
was
not
he
meshed
gears
silently
and
swung
the
car
away
to
seek
shelter
taking
with
him
the
sympathy
as
well
as
the
wonder
of
the
one
witness
of
this
bit
of
who
had
been
able
to
understand
the
tongue
in
which
it
was
couched
and
who
knowing
too
well
what
rain
in
those
hills
could
mean
was
beginning
to
regret
that
his
invitation
to
the
château
had
not
been
for
another
night
as
for
the
somewhat
unusual
tone
of
the
passage
to
which
he
had
just
listened
his
nimble
wits
could
invent
half
a
dozen
plausible
explanations
it
was
quite
possible
indeed
when
one
judged
phinuit
by
his
sobriety
in
contrast
with
the
gaiety
of
the
others
it
seemed
quite
plausible
that
he
was
equally
with
jules
a
paid
employee
of
those
ostensible
nouveaux
riches
and
that
the
two
the
chauffeur
and
the
courier
or
whatever
phinuit
was
in
his
subordinate
social
rating
were
accustomed
to
amuse
themselves
by
indulging
in
reciprocal
abuse
but
what
duchemin
could
by
no
means
fathom
was
the
reason
why
phinuit
should
choose
and
how
he
should
rule
the
choice
of
his
party
in
the
face
of
such
threatening
weather
to
stop
in
nant
for
an
early
dinner
with
millau
only
an
hour
away
and
the
chances
fair
that
before
the
storm
broke
the
automobile
would
reach
the
latter
city
with
its
superior
hotel
and
restaurant
accommodations
but
it
was
after
all
none
of
the
business
of
andré
duchemin
he
lighted
another
cigarette
observing
the
group
of
strangers
in
nant
with
an
open
inquisitiveness
wholly
gallic
therefore
inconspicuous
the
entire
clientèle
of
the
café
de
was
doing
the
same
party
was
the
focal
point
of
between
twenty
and
thirty
pair
of
staring
eyes
and
was
enduring
this
with
much
equanimity
phinuit
was
conferring
earnestly
over
the
menu
with
madame
la
propriétaire
the
others
were
ordering
aperitifs
of
a
waiter
through
the
clatter
of
tongues
that
filled
the
café
one
caught
the
phrase
veeskysoda
uttered
by
the
monsieur
in
tweeds
then
the
tall
man
consulted
the
beautiful
lady
as
to
her
preference
and
duchemin
caught
the
words
madame
la
comtesse
spoken
in
the
rasping
nasal
drawl
of
an
american
evidently
a
person
of
rich
humour
the
speaker
madame
la
comtesse
was
abruptly
convulsed
with
laughter
the
chubby
gentleman
roared
phinuit
looked
up
from
the
carte
with
an
enquiring
receptive
smile
the
waiter
grinned
broadly
but
the
cause
of
all
this
merriment
wore
only
an
expression
of
slightly
pained
bewilderment
on
his
of
a
face
at
that
moment
arrived
the
calèche
which
duchemin
had
commanded
to
drive
him
to
the
château
and
with
a
ride
of
two
miles
before
him
and
rain
imminent
he
had
no
more
time
to
waste
vi
visitation
dinner
was
served
in
a
vast
and
sombre
hall
whose
darkly
panelled
walls
and
ceiling
bred
a
multitude
of
shadows
that
danced
about
the
table
a
weird
spasmodic
saraband
without
meaning
or
end
restlessly
advancing
and
retreating
as
the
candles
flickered
failed
and
flared
in
the
gusty
draughts
there
was
duchemin
learned
no
other
means
of
illumination
but
by
in
the
entire
château
the
structure
had
been
thoroughly
renovated
and
modernised
in
most
respects
it
was
furnished
with
taste
and
reverence
one
could
guess
whose
the
taste
and
purse
but
madame
de
sévénié
remained
its
undisputed
chatelaine
a
belated
spirit
of
the
ancien
régime
stubbornly
set
against
the
conveniences
of
this
degenerate
age
electric
lighting
she
would
never
countenance
the
telephone
she
esteemed
a
convenience
for
tradespeople
and
vulgarians
in
general
beneath
the
dignity
of
leisured
quality
the
motor
car
she
disapproved
yet
tolerated
because
for
all
her
years
she
was
of
a
brisk
and
active
turn
and
liked
to
get
about
whereas
since
the
war
good
horseflesh
was
difficult
to
find
in
france
and
men
to
care
for
it
more
scarce
still
so
much
and
more
besides
she
communicated
to
duchemin
at
intervals
during
the
meal
comporting
herself
toward
him
with
graciousness
not
altogether
innocent
of
a
certain
faded
coquetry
having
spoken
of
herself
as
one
born
too
late
for
her
time
she
paused
and
eyed
him
keenly
a
gleam
of
light
malice
in
her
bright
old
eyes
and
you
too
monsieur
she
added
suddenly
but
you
i
think
belong
to
an
even
earlier
day
i
madame
and
why
do
you
say
that
i
should
have
been
guillotined
under
the
terror
but
you
monsieur
you
should
have
been
hanged
long
before
that
hanged
for
a
buccaneer
on
the
spanish
main
madame
may
be
right
said
duchemin
amused
and
quite
possibly
i
was
you
know
then
he
wondered
a
little
and
began
to
cultivate
some
respect
for
the
shrewdness
of
her
intuitions
he
sat
on
her
left
the
place
of
honour
going
by
custom
immemorial
to
monsieur
le
curé
of
nant
for
all
that
duchemin
declined
to
feel
slighted
was
he
not
on
the
right
of
eve
de
montalais
the
girl
louise
was
placed
between
the
curé
and
her
duchemia
could
not
have
been
guilty
of
the
offence
of
ignoring
her
but
the
truth
is
that
save
when
courtesy
demanded
that
he
pay
her
some
attention
he
hardly
saw
her
she
was
pretty
enough
but
very
quiet
and
a
slender
nervous
creature
with
that
pathetically
eager
look
peculiar
to
her
age
and
caste
in
france
starving
for
the
life
she
might
not
live
till
marriage
should
set
her
free
a
pale
and
ineffective
wraith
beside
eve
whose
beauty
relieved
in
candleglow
against
the
background
of
melting
darkness
burned
like
some
rare
exotic
flower
set
before
a
screen
of
lustreless
black
velvet
and
like
a
flower
to
the
sun
she
responded
to
the
homage
of
his
admiration
which
he
was
none
the
less
studious
to
preserve
from
the
sin
of
obviousness
for
he
was
well
aware
that
her
response
was
impersonal
it
was
not
his
but
any
admiration
that
she
craved
as
a
parched
land
wants
rain
less
than
three
months
a
wife
more
than
five
years
a
widow
still
young
and
ardent
nearing
the
noontide
of
her
womanhood
and
immolated
in
this
house
of
perennial
mourning
making
vain
oblation
of
her
youth
her
beauty
the
rich
wine
of
life
that
coursed
so
lustily
through
her
being
upon
the
altar
of
a
memory
whose
high
priestess
was
only
an
old
old
woman
he
perceived
that
it
would
be
quite
possible
for
him
did
he
yield
to
the
bent
of
his
sympathies
to
dislike
madame
de
sévénié
most
intensely
not
that
he
was
apt
to
have
much
opportunity
to
encourage
such
a
gratuitous
aversion
would
see
him
on
the
road
again
his
back
forever
turned
to
the
château
de
montalais
or
if
not
then
as
soon
as
the
storm
abated
it
was
raging
now
as
if
it
would
never
weaken
and
had
the
will
to
raze
the
château
though
it
were
the
task
of
a
thousand
years
from
time
to
time
the
shock
of
some
great
blast
of
air
would
seem
to
rock
upon
its
foundations
even
that
ancient
pile
those
heavy
walls
of
hewn
stone
builded
in
times
of
honest
workmanship
by
forgotten
sieurs
de
montalais
who
had
meant
their
home
to
outlast
the
ages
rain
in
sheets
sluiced
the
windows
without
rest
round
turrets
and
gables
the
wind
raved
and
moaned
like
a
famished
wild
thing
denied
its
kill
occasionally
a
venturesome
gust
with
the
spirit
of
a
minor
demon
would
find
its
way
down
the
chimney
to
the
fire
and
send
sparks
in
volleys
against
the
screen
with
thin
puffs
of
wood
smoke
that
lingered
in
the
air
like
acrid
ghosts
at
such
times
the
curé
sitting
at
piquet
with
madame
de
sévénié
after
dinner
would
cough
distressingly
and
reminded
that
he
had
a
bed
to
reach
somehow
through
all
this
welter
anathematise
the
elements
help
himself
to
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
proceed
with
his
play
duchemin
sat
at
a
little
distance
talking
with
madame
de
montalais
over
their
cigarettes
to
smoking
curiously
enough
madame
de
sévénié
offered
no
objection
women
had
not
smoked
in
her
day
and
she
for
her
part
would
never
but
eve
might
it
was
done
even
in
those
circles
of
hidebound
conservatism
the
society
of
the
faubourg
germain
ladies
of
this
day
smoked
unrebuked
louise
had
excused
herself
to
sit
duchemin
had
no
doubt
by
the
bedside
of
under
the
eye
of
an
old
nurse
of
the
family
being
duly
encouraged
duchemin
talked
about
himself
of
his
wanderings
and
adventures
all
with
discretion
with
the
neatest
expurgations
and
with
an
object
leading
cunningly
round
to
the
subject
of
new
york
at
mention
of
it
he
saw
a
new
light
kindle
in
eve
eyes
her
breath
came
more
quickly
gentle
emotion
agitated
her
bosom
monsieur
knew
new
york
but
well
he
had
been
there
as
a
boy
again
as
a
young
man
and
then
later
in
the
year
when
america
entered
the
great
war
not
since
it
is
my
home
said
eve
de
montalais
softly
looking
away
one
noted
that
she
said
is
not
was
so
duchemin
had
understood
madame
had
not
visited
her
home
recently
not
in
many
years
not
in
fact
since
she
assumed
the
city
must
have
changed
greatly
duchemin
thought
it
was
never
the
same
but
forever
changing
itself
overnight
so
to
speak
and
yet
always
itself
always
like
no
other
city
in
the
world
fascinating
fascinating
but
irresistible
how
i
long
for
it
she
was
distrait
for
an
instant
my
new
york
monsieur
would
you
believe
i
dream
of
it
he
had
found
a
key
to
one
chamber
in
the
mansion
of
her
confidence
as
much
to
herself
as
to
him
unconsciously
dropping
into
english
she
began
to
talk
of
her
life
at
home
her
father
had
been
a
partner
in
a
great
jewellery
house
cottier
of
paris
london
and
new
york
so
that
explained
it
she
was
wearing
the
blue
diamond
again
tonight
with
other
jewels
worth
in
the
judgment
of
a
keen
connoisseur
a
king
ransom
schooled
at
an
exclusive
establishment
for
the
daughters
of
people
of
fashion
eve
at
an
early
age
had
made
her
début
but
within
the
year
her
father
died
and
her
mother
whose
heart
had
always
been
in
the
city
of
her
nativity
closed
the
house
on
east
street
and
removed
with
her
daughter
to
paris
there
eve
had
met
her
future
husband
shortly
after
her
mother
died
eve
returned
to
new
york
to
attend
to
some
business
in
connection
with
her
estate
remaining
only
a
few
weeks
leaving
almost
reluctantly
but
the
new
love
was
very
sweet
she
had
looked
forward
joyfully
to
the
final
transplanting
of
her
affections
and
then
the
war
the
short
month
of
long
long
days
in
the
apartment
on
the
avenue
des
waiting
waiting
while
the
earth
trembled
to
the
tramp
of
armed
men
and
the
tireless
rumbling
of
caissons
and
camions
and
the
air
was
vibrant
with
the
savage
dialogue
of
cannon
ever
louder
daily
more
near
she
fell
silent
sitting
with
bowed
head
and
gaze
remote
from
the
splendid
jewels
that
adorned
the
fingers
twisting
together
in
her
lap
the
firelight
struck
coruscant
gleams
now
i
hate
paris
i
wish
never
to
see
it
again
duchemin
uttered
a
sympathetic
murmur
but
new
york
ah
but
sometimes
i
think
i
would
give
anything
to
be
there
once
more
the
animation
with
which
this
confession
was
delivered
proved
transient
then
i
remind
myself
i
have
no
one
there
a
few
friends
yes
acquaintances
but
no
family
ties
no
one
dear
to
me
but
pardon
you
stay
here
it
is
beautiful
here
monsieur
but
such
solitude
such
isolation
for
you
madame
i
know
still
i
am
fond
of
the
life
here
it
was
here
i
found
myself
again
after
my
grief
and
i
am
fond
of
my
adopted
mother
and
louise
too
and
they
of
me
indeed
i
am
all
they
have
left
louise
of
course
will
marry
before
long
georges
she
used
given
name
will
take
her
away
then
madame
de
sévénié
will
have
nobody
but
me
and
at
her
age
it
would
be
too
sad
across
the
that
lady
looked
up
from
her
cards
and
sharply
interrogated
a
manservant
who
had
silently
presented
himself
to
her
attention
what
is
it
you
want
jean
the
servant
mumbled
his
justification
an
automobile
had
broken
down
on
the
highroad
near
the
château
the
chauffeur
was
unable
to
move
the
car
or
make
any
repairs
in
the
storm
a
gentleman
had
come
to
the
door
to
ask
he
moved
aside
indicating
the
doorway
to
the
entrance
hall
beyond
which
phinuit
was
to
be
seen
standing
with
cap
in
hand
tiny
rivulets
running
from
the
folds
of
his
and
forming
pools
on
the
polished
flooring
as
in
concerted
movement
madame
de
sévénié
eve
de
montalais
the
curé
and
duchemin
approached
his
cool
intelligent
glance
surveyed
them
swiftly
each
in
turn
and
with
unerring
instinct
settled
on
the
first
as
the
one
to
whom
he
must
address
himself
but
the
bow
with
which
he
also
acknowledged
the
presence
of
eve
was
hardly
less
profound
duchemin
himself
at
his
best
could
hardly
have
bettered
it
his
manner
in
fact
left
nothing
to
be
desired
and
the
french
in
which
immediately
he
begged
a
thousand
pardons
for
the
intrusion
was
so
admirable
that
it
seemed
hard
to
believe
he
was
the
same
man
who
had
only
a
few
hours
earlier
composedly
traded
the
slang
of
the
states
with
a
chauffeur
in
front
of
the
café
de
phinuit
was
desolated
to
think
he
might
be
imposing
on
good
nature
but
the
accident
was
positive
the
night
truly
inclement
madame
la
comtesse
was
already
suffering
from
the
cold
and
if
one
might
beg
shelter
for
her
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
while
one
telephoned
or
sent
to
nant
for
another
automobile
but
monsieur
might
feel
very
sure
madame
de
sévénié
would
never
forgive
herself
if
the
hospitality
of
the
château
de
montalais
failed
at
such
a
time
she
would
send
servants
to
the
car
at
once
with
lights
wraps
umbrellas
there
was
no
necessity
for
that
the
remainder
of
the
party
had
it
seemed
presumed
upon
her
courtesy
in
anticipation
and
was
not
far
from
the
heels
of
its
ambassador
even
while
madame
was
speaking
jean
was
opening
the
great
front
doors
to
those
who
proved
formal
introductions
being
duly
effect
by
phinuit
to
be
madame
la
comtesse
de
lorgnes
monsieur
le
comte
her
husband
this
was
the
body
in
tweeds
and
whitaker
monk
of
new
york
these
personages
were
really
not
at
all
in
a
bad
way
their
wraps
were
well
peppered
with
rain
they
were
chilly
the
footgear
of
madame
la
comtesse
was
wet
and
needed
changing
but
that
was
the
worst
of
their
plight
and
when
phinuit
learning
that
there
was
no
telephone
had
accepted
an
offer
of
the
montalais
motor
car
to
tow
the
other
under
cover
and
so
enable
jules
to
make
repairs
and
eve
de
montalais
had
carried
madame
la
comtesse
off
to
her
own
apartment
to
change
her
shoes
and
stockings
the
gentlemen
trooped
to
the
fire
at
the
instance
of
madame
de
sévénié
and
grew
quite
cheerful
under
the
combined
influence
of
warmth
and
wine
and
biscuits
duchemin
standing
by
with
a
doubt
to
preoccupy
him
vaguely
disturbed
by
the
oddness
of
this
rencontre
considered
in
relation
to
that
injudicious
stop
for
dinner
at
nant
in
the
face
of
the
impending
storm
and
with
phinuit
declaration
that
he
did
give
a
tupenny
damn
if
they
did
all
get
soaked
to
their
skins
it
seemed
and
ridiculous
to
imagine
that
people
of
their
intelligence
and
they
were
most
of
them
unusually
intelligent
and
alert
if
demeanour
and
utterances
might
be
taken
as
criterion
should
adopt
any
such
elaborate
machinery
of
mystification
and
duplicity
in
order
to
gain
an
introduction
to
the
château
de
montalais
with
what
possible
motive
but
there
was
the
devil
of
having
a
mind
like
duchemin
once
it
conceived
a
notion
like
that
it
was
all
but
impossible
for
him
to
dislodge
it
unless
or
until
something
happened
to
persuade
him
of
his
stupidity
now
to
make
his
suspicions
seem
at
all
reasonable
a
motive
was
lacking
and
that
worried
the
man
hugely
he
desired
most
earnestly
to
justify
his
captiousness
and
to
this
end
exercised
a
power
of
conscientious
observation
on
his
new
acquaintances
monsieur
le
comte
de
lorgnes
he
was
disposed
to
pass
at
face
value
as
an
innocuous
being
good
natured
enough
but
none
too
brilliant
with
much
of
the
disposition
of
an
overgrown
boy
and
a
rather
boyish
tendency
to
admire
and
imitate
in
others
qualities
which
he
did
not
himself
possess
phinuit
had
not
returned
so
there
was
no
present
opportunity
to
take
further
note
of
him
though
duchemin
first
inferred
from
monk
manner
and
later
learned
through
a
chance
remark
of
his
that
phinuit
was
his
secretary
upon
this
monk
duchemin
concentrated
close
attention
satisfied
that
he
had
here
to
do
with
an
extraordinary
personality
if
not
one
unique
whitaker
monk
might
have
been
any
age
between
and
so
was
that
countenance
of
a
droll
with
its
heavy
black
eloquent
eyebrows
its
high
and
narrow
forehead
merging
into
an
extensive
bald
spot
fringed
with
greyish
hair
its
rather
small
blue
illegible
eyes
its
nose
and
prominent
nostrils
its
wide
and
mouth
its
rather
startling
pallor
taller
by
a
head
than
anybody
in
the
room
except
duchemin
his
figure
was
remarkably
thin
yet
not
neither
was
monk
ill
at
ease
or
ungraceful
in
his
actions
clothed
in
that
extravagantly
correct
costume
correct
at
least
for
a
if
never
for
motoring
he
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
comedian
fresh
from
the
hands
of
his
dresser
one
naturally
expected
of
him
mere
grotesqueries
and
found
simply
the
courteous
demeanour
of
a
gentleman
of
the
world
so
much
for
externals
but
what
more
nature
herself
had
cast
monk
in
the
very
mould
of
a
masquerader
what
manner
of
man
was
hidden
behind
the
mask
his
words
and
deeds
alone
would
tell
duchemin
could
only
weigh
the
one
and
await
the
other
in
the
meantime
monk
was
sketching
rapidly
for
the
benefit
of
madame
de
sévénié
the
excuse
for
his
present
plight
a
chance
meeting
at
monte
carlo
he
said
with
his
old
friends
the
comte
et
comtesse
de
lorgnes
had
resulted
in
their
yielding
to
his
insistence
that
they
tour
with
him
back
to
paris
by
this
roundabout
way
a
whim
of
my
age
madame
somehow
the
nasal
intonation
of
the
american
suited
singularly
well
his
fluent
french
he
seemed
to
have
less
trouble
with
his
r
than
most
as
a
young
man
a
younger
man
ah
well
in
then
i
explored
this
country
on
a
walking
tour
inspired
by
stevenson
you
know
perhaps
his
diverting
travels
with
a
donkey
but
i
daresay
its
spirit
would
hardly
have
survived
translation
at
all
events
i
had
the
whim
to
revisit
some
of
those
scenes
i
say
some
for
naturally
it
would
be
impossible
even
with
the
vastly
improved
roads
of
for
my
automobile
to
penetrate
everywhere
i
wandered
afoot
nor
would
i
wish
it
to
a
few
disappointments
a
few
failures
to
recapture
something
of
that
first
fine
careless
rapture
would
instill
a
lyric
melancholy
but
too
many
would
make
one
morbid
well
then
at
nant
in
those
old
days
i
once
had
a
famous
dinner
and
naturally
returning
i
must
try
to
duplicate
it
even
though
it
meant
going
on
to
millau
in
the
rain
but
alas
the
café
de
is
no
more
what
it
was
or
i
am
grown
over
critical
what
now
of
duchemin
doubts
to
tell
the
sad
truth
they
were
just
as
strong
as
ever
the
man
was
somehow
prejudiced
he
found
monk
story
entirely
too
glib
and
knew
a
mean
sense
of
gratification
when
the
curé
interposed
a
gentle
correction
but
in
monsieur
there
was
no
café
de
in
nant
astonished
eyebrows
climbed
the
forehead
of
monk
no
monsieur
le
curé
truly
not
then
it
must
have
been
another
how
one
memory
will
play
one
false
how
strange
then
is
coincidence
madame
de
sévénié
suggested
you
who
made
a
walking
tour
of
this
country
so
long
ago
monsieur
regard
there
that
good
monsieur
duchemin
himself
engaged
upon
just
such
an
undertaking
duchemin
acknowledged
with
a
humorous
little
nod
monk
look
of
moderate
amazement
at
this
so
strange
coincidence
a
whim
of
my
age
monsieur
he
said
a
project
i
have
entertained
since
youth
but
always
till
of
late
lacked
leisure
to
put
into
execution
but
is
there
anything
more
wonderful
than
the
workings
of
the
good
god
madame
pursued
observe
that
if
monsieur
duchemin
had
been
suffered
to
indulge
his
inclination
in
youth
we
should
all
i
my
daughter
my
even
poor
georges
would
quite
probably
be
lying
dead
at
the
bottom
of
a
cirque
at
naturally
the
strangers
required
to
know
about
that
and
madame
de
sévénié
would
talk
in
fact
doted
on
telling
the
tale
of
that
great
adventure
duchemin
made
a
face
of
resignation
and
heard
himself
extolled
as
a
paladin
for
strength
address
and
valour
the
truth
being
that
he
was
not
at
all
resigned
and
would
infinitely
liefer
have
been
left
out
of
the
limelight
the
more
he
was
represented
as
a
person
of
consequence
the
less
fair
his
chance
to
study
these
others
at
his
leisure
in
the
comfortable
obscurity
of
their
indifference
now
the
enigmatic
eyes
of
monk
were
boring
into
him
seeking
to
search
his
soul
with
a
question
in
their
stare
which
he
could
not
read
and
quite
likely
would
have
declined
to
answer
if
he
could
also
the
eyes
of
monsieur
le
comte
de
lorgnes
were
very
round
and
constant
to
him
and
before
madame
de
sévénié
was
finished
phinuit
strolled
in
and
heard
enough
to
make
him
subject
duchemin
to
a
not
unfriendly
steady
and
open
inspection
and
when
the
trumpets
had
been
flourished
finally
for
duchemin
and
he
had
dutifully
assured
madame
that
she
was
too
generous
and
had
acknowledged
congratulations
on
his
exploit
phinuit
strolled
over
and
offered
a
hand
good
work
he
said
in
english
seen
you
before
have
i
somewhere
mr
duchemin
under
other
circumstances
duchemin
not
at
all
hoodwinked
by
this
too
obvious
stratagem
would
have
taken
mean
pleasure
in
looking
blank
and
begging
monsieur
to
interpret
himself
in
french
but
with
or
without
cunning
phinuit
question
was
eve
de
montalais
was
at
that
moment
entering
the
with
madame
la
comtesse
de
lorgnes
and
she
knew
very
well
that
duchemin
english
was
quite
as
good
as
his
french
at
the
café
de
this
afternoon
he
replied
frankly
i
remember
you
drove
away
just
before
the
storm
broke
in
a
ramshackle
rig
that
must
have
come
out
of
the
ark
to
come
here
mr
phinuit
funny
said
phinuit
with
hesitation
your
being
there
and
then
our
turning
up
here
duchemin
thought
he
knew
what
was
on
the
other
mind
i
was
immensely
entertained
do
you
mind
my
saying
so
to
hear
the
way
your
chauffeur
talked
to
you
monsieur
tell
me
is
it
the
custom
in
your
country
oh
jules
said
phinuit
and
laughed
jules
is
my
younger
brother
when
he
was
demobilised
his
job
was
gone
back
home
and
i
wished
him
on
monk
as
a
chauffeur
we
always
kidding
each
other
like
that
now
what
could
be
more
reasonable
duchemin
wondered
and
concluded
that
if
anything
it
would
be
the
truth
but
he
did
not
pretend
to
himself
that
he
was
quite
illogically
and
with
no
provocation
whatsoever
most
vilely
prejudiced
against
the
lot
of
them
but
you
must
know
america
to
speak
the
language
as
well
as
you
do
duchemin
nodded
but
very
slightly
monsieur
i
was
wondering
somehow
i
ca
get
it
out
of
my
head
i
seen
you
somewhere
before
it
is
quite
possible
when
one
moves
about
the
world
one
is
visible
pas
monsieur
but
my
home
duchemin
added
is
paris
i
guess
said
phinuit
in
a
tone
of
singular
disappointment
it
must
have
been
there
i
saw
you
duchemin
bow
signified
that
he
was
content
to
let
it
go
at
that
moreover
monk
was
signalling
to
phinuit
with
his
expressive
eyebrows
what
about
the
car
phin
examining
his
wrist
watch
phinuit
drew
near
his
employer
jules
should
not
need
more
than
half
an
hour
now
monsieur
was
there
in
this
employment
of
french
to
respond
to
a
question
couched
in
english
the
suggestion
of
a
subtle
correction
from
employé
to
employer
if
not
why
must
duchemin
have
thought
so
if
so
why
did
monk
without
betraying
a
sign
of
feeling
the
reproof
continue
in
french
did
jules
say
half
an
hour
yes
monsieur
my
god
monk
addressed
the
company
if
i
were
pressed
for
time
i
would
rather
have
one
of
jules
than
anybody
else
hour
and
a
half
let
us
hope
however
the
comtesse
de
lorgnes
interposed
sweetly
by
that
time
this
so
dreadful
tempest
will
have
moderated
one
has
that
hope
her
husband
uttered
in
a
sepulchral
voice
but
if
the
storm
continue
madame
de
sévénié
said
you
must
not
think
of
travelling
farther
on
such
a
night
the
château
is
large
there
is
ample
accommodation
for
all
there
was
a
negligible
pause
during
which
duchemin
saw
the
long
lashes
of
the
comtesse
de
lorgnes
curtain
momentarily
her
disastrous
violet
eyes
it
was
a
sign
of
assent
immediately
it
was
followed
by
the
least
of
negative
movements
of
her
head
she
was
looking
directly
at
phinuit
who
so
far
as
duchemin
could
see
made
no
sign
of
any
sort
who
neither
spoke
nor
acted
on
the
signals
which
indubitably
he
had
received
on
the
other
hand
it
was
monk
who
acknowledged
the
proffered
courtesy
madame
de
sévénié
is
too
good
but
we
could
not
dream
of
imposing
no
but
truly
madame
i
am
obliged
to
ask
my
guests
to
proceed
with
me
to
millau
regardless
of
the
weather
important
despatches
concerning
my
business
await
me
there
i
must
consider
them
and
reply
by
cable
without
fail
it
is
really
of
the
most
pressing
necessity
otherwise
we
should
be
honoured
madame
de
sévénié
inclined
her
head
it
must
be
as
monsieur
thinks
best
but
monsieur
monk
madame
la
comtesse
exclaimed
with
vivacity
do
you
know
what
i
have
just
discovered
you
and
madame
de
montalais
are
compatriots
she
is
of
your
new
york
you
must
know
each
other
i
have
been
wondering
monk
admitted
bowing
to
eve
if
it
were
possible
i
could
be
misled
by
a
strong
resemblance
eve
turned
to
him
with
a
look
of
surprise
yes
monsieur
it
is
many
years
ago
you
were
a
young
girl
then
if
it
was
truly
you
madame
but
i
have
a
keen
eye
for
beauty
i
do
not
soon
forget
it
i
was
in
the
private
office
of
my
friend
edmund
anstruther
of
cottier
one
afternoon
selecting
a
trinket
with
his
advice
and
that
was
my
father
monsieur
then
it
was
you
madame
i
felt
sure
of
it
you
came
in
unannounced
to
see
your
father
he
made
me
known
to
you
as
a
friend
of
his
and
requested
you
to
wait
in
an
adjoining
office
but
that
was
not
necessary
i
had
already
made
up
my
mind
i
left
almost
immediately
do
you
by
any
chance
remember
the
effort
of
the
memory
knitted
eve
brows
but
in
the
end
she
shook
her
head
i
am
sorry
monsieur
but
why
should
you
be
why
should
you
have
remembered
me
you
were
a
young
girl
then
as
i
say
and
i
already
a
man
of
middle
age
you
saw
me
once
for
perhaps
two
minutes
it
would
have
been
a
miracle
had
i
remained
in
your
memory
for
as
long
as
a
single
day
nevertheless
remembered
i
am
so
glad
to
meet
a
friend
of
my
father
monsieur
and
i
to
recall
myself
to
his
daughter
i
have
often
wondered
would
you
mind
telling
me
something
madame
de
montalais
if
i
can
your
father
and
i
entertained
one
passion
in
common
one
which
he
was
better
able
than
i
to
gratify
for
good
diamonds
and
emeralds
i
have
often
wondered
what
became
of
his
collection
he
had
some
superb
stones
i
inherited
them
monsieur
they
did
not
find
their
way
into
cottier
stock
then
the
comtesse
de
lorgnes
gave
a
gesture
of
excitement
but
what
a
fortunate
woman
you
truly
have
those
magnificent
emeralds
those
almost
matchless
diamonds
of
which
one
has
heard
the
anstruther
collection
i
have
them
madame
la
comtesse
said
eve
with
a
smiling
nod
yes
but
one
presumes
in
paris
in
some
impregnable
no
madame
here
but
not
here
madame
de
montalais
to
this
eve
gave
another
nod
and
smile
but
are
you
not
afraid
of
what
madame
that
they
will
be
stolen
no
they
have
been
in
my
possession
for
years
indeed
i
should
be
unhappy
otherwise
for
i
have
inherited
my
father
fondness
for
them
and
nobody
has
ever
even
attempted
to
steal
them
but
what
of
the
affair
at
montpellier
the
other
night
enquired
the
comte
de
lorgnes
that
terrible
attack
upon
you
of
which
madame
de
sévénié
has
just
told
us
surely
you
would
call
that
an
attempt
to
steal
simple
highway
robbery
if
you
like
monsieur
le
comte
but
even
had
it
proved
successful
i
had
very
few
jewels
with
me
all
that
mattered
all
that
i
would
have
minded
losing
were
here
in
a
safe
place
nevertheless
said
monk
if
you
will
permit
me
to
offer
a
word
of
advice
i
think
you
are
very
unwise
it
may
be
monsieur
nonsense
madame
de
sévénié
declared
who
would
dare
attempt
to
burglarise
the
château
de
montalais
such
a
thing
was
never
heard
of
there
is
always
the
first
time
for
everything
madame
monk
suggested
gently
i
fancy
it
was
your
first
experience
of
the
sort
at
montpellier
a
rascally
chauffeur
from
paris
a
few
low
characters
of
the
department
since
the
war
things
are
not
as
they
were
that
is
the
very
reason
why
i
suggest
madame
but
monsieur
i
assure
you
all
my
life
i
have
lived
at
montalais
monsieur
le
curé
will
tell
you
i
know
every
face
hereabouts
and
i
know
that
these
poor
these
dolts
of
peasants
have
not
the
imagination
much
less
the
courage
but
what
of
criminals
from
outside
from
the
great
cities
from
london
and
paris
and
berlin
they
have
the
imagination
the

if
they
ever
get

of
the
fortune
madame
de
montalais
keeps
locked
up
here
what
of
the
lone
wolf
the
comtesse
de
lorgnes
added
i
have
heard
that
one
is
once
more
in
france
duchemin
blinked
incredulously
at
the
speaker
but
when
did
you
hear
that
madame
la
comtesse
quite
recently
monsieur
i
had
understood
that
the
monsieur
in
question
had
long
since
retired
only
for
the
duration
of
the
war
monsieur
i
am
afraid
it
is
true
according
to
all
reports
the
comte
de
lorgnes
said
monsieur
lanyard
that
was
the
name
was
it
not
if
memory
serves
monsieur
le
comte
duchemin
agreed
yes
the
count
screwed
his
chubby
features
into
a
laughable
mask
of
gravity
now
one
remembers
quite
well
he
passed
as
a
collector
of
objets
especially
of
fine
paintings
in
paris
for
years
before
the
war
this
monsieur
michael
lanyard
then
he
disappeared
it
was
rumoured
that
he
was
of
good
service
to
the
allies
as
a
spy
acting
independently
and
after
the
armistice
i
have
heard
he
did
well
for
england
in
the
matter
of
a
bolshevist
conspiracy
over
there
but
not
long
ago
according
to
my
information
monsieur
the
lone
wolf
resigned
from
the
british
secret
service
and
returned
to
france
doubtless
to
resume
his
old
practices
perhaps
not
duchemin
suggested
possibly
his
reformation
was
genuine
and
lasting
the
comtesse
de
lorgnes
laughed
that
laugh
of
light
derision
which
is
almost
exclusively
the
laugh
of
the
parisienne
of
a
certain
class
remarking
this
duchemin
eyed
her
mildly
madame
la
comtesse
does
not
believe
that
well
who
knows
perhaps
she
is
right
possibly
she
knows
more
of
the
nature
and
habits
of
the
criminal
classes
than
we
sharing
as
she
does
no
doubt
the
apparently
accurate
and
precise
sources
of
information
of
monsieur
le
comte
at
all
events
phinuit
put
in
promptly
i
know
what
i
would
do
if
i
possessed
a
little
fortune
in
jewels
and
learned
that
a
thief
of
the
ability
of
this
lone
wolf
was
at
large
in
france
i
would
charter
an
armoured
train
to
convey
the
loot
to
the
strongest
safe
deposit
vault
in
paris
thereby
advertising
to
the
lone
wolf
the
exact
location
of
the
jewels
monsieur
so
that
he
might
at
his
leisure
make
his
plans
perfect
to
burglarise
the
vaults
is
that
likely
phinuit
jeered
duchemin
gave
a
slight
shrug
one
has
heard
that
the
fellow
had
real
ability
he
said
the
servant
jean
came
in
caught
the
eye
of
madame
de
sévénié
and
announced
the
chauffeur
of
monsieur
monk
wishes
me
to
say
he
has
completed
repairs
on
the
automobile
and
the
rain
has
ceased
vii
turn
about
duchemin
took
back
with
him
to
nant
that
night
not
only
monsieur
le
curé
in
the
hired
calèche
but
food
in
plenty
for
thought
together
with
a
nebulous
notion
which
by
the
time
he
woke
up
next
morning
had
taken
shape
as
a
fixed
conviction
that
he
had
better
resign
himself
to
stop
on
indefinitely
at
the
grand
hôtel
de
and
see
what
he
should
see
that
fatality
on
which
he
had
so
bitterly
reflected
when
acting
as
emergency
coachman
en
route
from
to
la
had
him
now
fairly
by
the
heels
as
it
were
his
very
shadow
something
as
tenacious
as
inescapable
or
he
had
been
given
every
excuse
for
believing
that
such
was
the
case
impossible
and
the
more
so
the
longer
he
pondered
it
to
credit
to
mere
coincidence
the
innuendoes
uttered
at
the
château
by
monk
and
his
party
no
there
had
been
malice
in
that
duchemin
was
satisfied
if
not
some
darker
purpose
which
perplexed
the
most
patient
scrutiny
now
malice
without
incentive
is
unthinkable
but
duchemin
searched
his
memory
in
vain
for
anything
he
could
have
said
or
done
to
make
anybody
desire
to
discredit
him
in
the
sight
of
the
ladies
of
the
château
de
montalais
still
the
attempt
so
to
do
had
been
unmistakable
the
lone
wolf
had
been
lugged
into
the
conversation
literally
by
his
legendary
ears
surely
one
would
think
that
nocturnal
prowler
of
paris
had
been
so
long
dead
and
buried
even
the
most
ghoulish
gossip
should
respect
his
poor
remains
and
not
disinter
them
merely
to
demonstrate
that
the
past
can
never
wholly
die
had
he
then
some
enemy
of
old
hidden
under
one
of
those
sleek
surfaces
an
excellent
visual
memory
reviewed
successively
the
physical
characteristics
of
messieurs
monk
phinuit
and
de
lorgnes
and
their
chauffeur
jules
with
the
upshot
that
duchemin
could
have
sworn
that
he
had
never
before
known
any
of
these
and
madame
la
comtesse
in
respect
of
that
one
memory
again
drew
a
blank
but
remained
unsatisfied
when
one
thought
of
her
some
remote
faint
chord
of
reminiscence
thrilled
and
hummed
but
never
recognisably
not
that
there
was
anything
remarkable
in
this
if
one
cared
to
look
for
them
the
world
was
thronged
with
women
such
as
she
handsome
spirited
animals
endued
with
some
little
distinction
of
manner
native
or
acquired
with
every
appeal
to
the
senses
and
more
or
less
generally
spurious
to
the
intelligence
they
made
the
theatre
possible
in
france
leavened
the
social
life
of
the
fluttered
conspicuously
and
often
disastrously
through
circles
of
more
sedate
society
had
their
portraits
in
every
salon
their
photographs
in
every
issue
of
the
fashionable
journals
some
made
history
others
fiction
either
would
be
insufferably
dull
lacking
their
influence
but
they
were
as
much
alike
as
so
many
peas
out
of
their
several
shells
and
the
man
who
saw
one
inevitably
remembered
all
setting
aside
then
the
theory
of
positive
personal
animus
what
other
reason
could
there
be
for
the
effort
to
fasten
upon
duchemin
suspicion
of
identity
with
the
late
lone
wolf
a
sinister
consideration
if
any
and
one
duchemin
suspected
not
unconnected
with
the
jewels
of
madame
de
montalais
but
it
was
absurd
to
believe
that
persons
fostering
a
design
of
such
nature
would
so
deliberately
and
obviously
advertise
their
purpose
cheerfully
admitting
that
he
was
an
imbecile
to
think
of
such
a
thing
duchemin
set
his
mental
alarm
for
six
the
following
morning
rose
at
that
hour
and
by
eight
had
tramped
the
five
miles
between
nant
and
the
nearest
railway
station
where
he
despatched
a
code
telegram
to
london
requesting
any
information
it
might
have
or
be
able
to
obtain
concerning
whitaker
monk
of
new
york
and
the
several
members
of
his
party
the
said
information
to
be
forwarded
in
code
to
await
the
arrival
of
andre
duchemin
at
the
hôtel
du
commerce
millau
and
then
partly
to
kill
time
partly
to
get
himself
in
trim
for
trip
which
he
meant
to
make
strictly
in
character
as
the
pedestrian
tourist
he
walked
round
three
sides
of
a
square
in
returning
to
nant
by
way
that
is
of
sauclières
and
the
upper
valley
of
the
dourbie
in
the
rich
sunshine
that
fell
from
a
cloudless
sky
even
the
twin
peaks
that
stood
sentinel
over
nant
had
shamelessly
put
off
their
yashmaks
for
the
day
the
world
was
sweet
to
see
and
duchemin
found
himself
consuming
leagues
with
heels
strangely
light
or
he
thought
their
lightness
strange
until
he
discovered
the
buoyance
of
his
heart
which
was
strange
at
all
he
knew
too
well
the
cause
of
that
and
had
given
over
fretting
about
the
inevitable
the
sum
of
his
philosophy
was
now
must
be
would
have
been
difficult
to
be
unhappy
in
the
knowledge
that
one
retained
still
the
capacity
to
love
generously
honourably
expecting
nothing
exacting
nothing
regretting
nothing
not
even
in
anticipation
of
the
ultimate
inevitable
heartache
toward
a
solitary
mischance
threw
a
passing
shadow
upon
his
content
as
he
trudged
along
the
river
road
on
the
last
lap
of
his
journey
nant
almost
in
sight
he
heard
a
curious
intermittent
rumble
on
a
steep
hillside
whose
foot
was
skirted
by
the
road
and
sought
its
cause
barely
in
time
to
leap
for
life
out
of
the
path
of
a
great
boulder
that
dislodged
from
its
bed
possibly
by
last
night
deluge
was
hurtling
downhill
with
such
momentum
that
it
must
have
crushed
duchemin
to
a
pulp
had
he
been
less
alert
striking
the
road
with
an
impact
that
left
a
deep
dent
with
one
final
bound
the
huge
stone
amid
vast
splashings
found
its
last
resting
place
in
the
river
duchemin
moved
out
of
the
way
of
the
miniature
avalanche
that
followed
and
for
some
minutes
stood
reviewing
with
a
truculent
eye
the
face
of
the
hillside
but
nothing
moved
thereon
it
was
quite
bare
of
good
cover
little
more
than
a
slant
of
naked
earth
and
shale
dotted
manywhere
with
boulders
cousins
to
that
which
sought
his
life
none
however
so
large
if
human
agency
had
moved
it
the
stone
had
come
from
the
high
skyline
of
the
hill
and
by
the
time
one
could
climb
to
this
last
duchemin
was
sure
there
would
be
nobody
there
to
find
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
was
wasted
utterly
on
the
terrasse
of
the
café
de
with
the
château
ever
in
view
wishing
it
were
convenable
to
make
one
duty
call
without
more
delay
but
it
was
not
to
wait
a
decent
interval
would
be
since
duchemin
had
no
longer
any
immediate
intention
of
moving
on
from
nant
finally
he
rather
hoped
to
get
news
at
millau
that
would
strengthen
a
prayer
to
eve
de
montalais
to
be
sensible
and
remove
her
jewels
to
a
place
of
before
it
was
too
late
millau
however
disappointed
at
the
end
of
a
walk
on
a
day
of
suffocating
heat
duchemin
plodded
wearily
into
the
hôtel
du
commerce
engaged
a
room
for
the
night
and
was
given
a
telegram
from
london
which
rewarded
decoding
to
some
such
effect
as
this
monk
american
independent
means
good
repute
no
information
as
to
others
have
asked
surété
concerning
lorgnes
would
give
something
to
know
what
mischief
you
are
meddling
with
this
trip
and
why
the
deuce
you
must
few
things
are
better
calculated
to
curdle
the
milk
of
human
kindness
than
to
find
that
one
has
meanly
contrived
to
keep
his
reputation
fair
when
one
is
satisfied
it
should
be
otherwise
duchemin
used
bitter
language
in
strict
confidence
with
himself
disliked
his
dinner
and
after
conscientiously
loathing
the
sights
of
millau
for
an
hour
or
two
sought
his
bed
in
the
devil
own
humour
though
he
waited
till
eleven
of
the
following
forenoon
there
was
no
supplementary
telegram
london
evidently
meant
him
to
understand
that
the
surété
in
paris
had
communicated
nothing
to
the
discredit
of
monsieur
le
comte
de
lorgnes
and
his
consort
enquiry
of
the
administration
of
the
hôtel
de
commerce
elicited
the
information
that
the
monk
party
had
stopped
there
on
the
night
of
the
storm
doubled
back
in
the
morning
to
visit
returning
for
midday
déjeuner
and
had
then
proceeded
for
paris
just
like
any
other
company
of
tourists
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
but
go
back
to
nant
and
what
made
it
even
more
disgusting
nothing
to
be
done
there
except
wait
thoroughly
disgruntled
more
than
half
persuaded
he
had
staked
a
claim
for
a
he
took
the
road
in
the
heat
of
a
day
even
more
oppressive
than
its
yesterday
in
the
valley
of
the
dourbie
the
air
was
stagnant
lifeless
after
eight
miles
of
it
duchemin
was
guilty
of
two
mistakes
of
desperation
in
the
first
instance
he
paused
in
la
and
tormented
by
thirst
refreshed
himself
at
the
auberge
where
the
barouche
and
guide
had
been
hired
to
convey
the
party
from
montalais
on
to
montpellier
the
landlord
remembered
duchemin
and
made
believe
he
did
serving
the
wayfarer
with
a
surly
grace
the
only
drink
he
would
admit
he
had
to
sell
an
atrociously
acid
cider
fit
to
render
the
last
stage
of
thirst
worse
than
the
first
duchemin
however
thought
it
safer
than
the
water
of
the
place
when
he
had
spied
out
the
associations
of
the
well
he
drank
sitting
on
a
bench
outside
the
door
of
the
auberge
he
could
hear
the
voice
of
the
landlord
inside
grumbling
and
growling
to
what
purport
he
could
determine
but
it
was
difficult
to
guess
and
before
duchemin
was
finished
he
had
testimony
to
the
rightness
of
his
surmise
finding
himself
the
cynosure
of
more
than
a
few
pair
of
eyes
set
in
the
faces
of
natives
of
la
roque
one
gathered
that
the
dead
guide
had
enjoyed
a
fair
amount
of
local
popularity
while
duchemin
drank
and
smoked
and
pored
over
a
of
the
department
a
lout
of
a
lad
shambled
out
of
the
auberge
wearing
a
fixed
scowl
in
no
degree
mitigated
by
the
sight
of
the
customer
in
the
dooryard
which
was
also
the
stableyard
the
boy
caught
and
saddled
a
dreary
animal
apparently
a
horse
designed
by
a
gothic
architect
mounted
and
rode
off
in
the
direction
of
nant
then
duchemin
committed
his
second
error
of
judgment
which
consisted
in
thinking
to
find
better
and
cooler
air
on
the
heights
of
the
causse
larzac
across
the
river
together
with
a
shorter
way
to
nant
indicated
on
the
as
a
running
in
a
tolerably
direct
line
across
the
plateau
than
that
which
followed
the
windings
of
the
stream
accordingly
he
crossed
the
dourbie
toiled
up
a
path
cut
in
the
face
of
the
frowning
cliff
reached
the
top
in
a
bath
of
sweat
and
sat
down
to
cool
and
breathe
himself
the
view
was
splendid
almost
worth
the
climb
duchemin
could
see
for
miles
up
and
down
the
valley
a
panorama
wildly
picturesque
and
limned
like
a
rainbow
across
the
way
la
stood
out
prominently
and
with
such
definition
in
that
clear
air
that
duchemin
identified
the
figure
of
the
landlord
standing
in
the
door
of
the
auberge
with
arms
raised
and
elbows
thrust
out
on
a
level
with
his
eyes
the
pose
of
a
man
using
duchemin
wondered
if
he
ought
to
feel
complimented
then
he
looked
up
the
valley
and
saw
far
off
a
tiny
cloud
of
dust
kicked
up
by
the
heels
of
the
horse
ridden
by
the
boy
from
the
auberge
making
good
time
on
the
highway
to
nant
and
again
duchemin
wondered
having
rested
he
picked
himself
up
found
his
road
a
mere
trail
of
wagon
tracks
and
mindful
of
the
cooling
drinks
to
be
had
in
the
café
de
put
his
best
foot
foremost
after
a
time
something
call
it
instinct
impelled
him
to
look
back
the
way
he
had
come
half
a
mile
distant
he
saw
the
figure
of
a
peasant
following
the
same
road
duchemin
stopped
and
waited
for
the
other
to
come
up
thinking
to
get
a
better
look
at
him
perhaps
some
definite
information
about
the
road
and
in
particular
as
to
his
chances
of
finding
drinkable
water
but
when
he
stopped
the
man
stopped
sat
him
down
upon
a
rock
filled
a
pipe
and
conspicuously
rested
duchemin
gave
an
impatient
gesture
and
moved
on
after
another
mile
he
glanced
overshoulder
again
the
same
peasant
occupied
the
same
relative
distance
from
him
but
if
the
fellow
were
following
him
with
a
purpose
he
could
readily
lose
himself
in
that
wild
land
before
duchemin
could
run
him
down
and
if
on
the
contrary
he
proved
to
be
only
a
peaceable
wayfarer
he
was
bound
to
be
a
dull
companion
on
the
road
and
an
unsavory
one
to
boot
so
duchemin
did
nothing
to
discourage
his
voluntary
shadow
but
looking
back
from
time
to
time
never
failed
to
see
that
squat
figure
in
the
middle
distance
of
the
landscape
following
him
with
the
doggedness
of
fate
toward
evening
however
of
a
sudden
between
two
glances
the
fellow
disappeared
as
completely
and
mysteriously
as
if
he
had
fallen
or
dived
into
an
aven
thus
definite
mental
irritation
was
added
to
the
physical
discomforts
he
suffered
for
if
anything
it
was
hotter
on
the
high
causse
than
it
had
been
in
the
valley
an
intermittent
breeze
imitated
to
vicious
perfection
draughts
from
a
furnace
and
if
this
were
a
short
cut
to
nant
duchemin
judgment
was
gravely
at
fault
otherwise
the
journey
was
not
unlike
an
exaggerated
version
of
his
walk
from
meyrueis
to
except
that
the
road
was
clearly
marked
and
he
found
less
climbing
to
do
he
saw
neither
hamlets
nor
farmsteads
and
found
no
water
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
his
thirst
had
become
sheer
torture
in
dusk
of
evening
he
stumbled
down
into
the
valley
again
and
struck
the
river
road
about
midway
between
the
château
de
montalais
and
nant
at
this
junction
several
dwellings
clustered
in
that
fading
light
dark
masses
on
either
side
of
the
road
duchemin
noticed
a
few
shadowy
shapes
loitering
about
but
was
too
far
gone
in
fatigue
and
thirst
to
pay
them
any
heed
he
had
no
thought
but
to
stop
at
the
first
house
and
beg
a
cup
of
water
as
he
lifted
a
hand
to
knuckle
the
door
he
was
attacked
with
no
more
warning
than
a
cry
the
signal
for
the
onslaught
and
the
sudden
scuffling
noise
of
several
pair
of
feet
he
wheeled
found
himself
already
closely
pressed
by
a
number
of
men
and
struck
out
at
random
his
stick
landed
on
somebody
head
with
a
resounding
thump
followed
by
a
yell
of
pain
then
three
men
were
grappling
with
him
two
more
seeking
to
aid
them
and
another
lay
in
the
roadway
clutching
a
fractured
skull
and
spitting
oaths
and
groans
his
stick
was
seized
and
wrenched
away
he
was
by
numbers
the
knot
of
struggling
figures
toppled
and
went
to
the
dust
duchemin
underneath
so
weighed
down
that
he
could
not
for
the
moment
move
a
hand
toward
his
pistol
by
the
reek
of
unwashed
flesh
he
heard
broken
phrases
growled
in
voices
hoarse
with
effort
and
excitement
the
knife
hold
him
stand
clear
and
let
me
the
knife
struggling
madly
he
worked
a
leg
free
and
kicked
with
all
his
might
one
of
his
assailants
howled
aloud
and
fell
back
to
nurse
a
broken
shin
two
others
scrambled
out
of
the
way
leaving
one
to
pin
him
down
with
knees
upon
his
chest
another
to
wield
the
knife
staring
eyes
caught
a
warning
gleam
on
descending
steel
duchemin
squirmed
frantically
to
one
side
and
felt
cold
metal
kiss
the
skin
over
his
ribs
as
the
blade
penetrated
his
clothing
close
under
the
armpit
before
the
man
with
the
knife
could
strike
again
duchemin
roused
to
a
mightier
effort
threw
off
the
ruffian
on
his
chest
got
on
his
knees
and
raining
blows
right
and
left
as
the
others
closed
in
again
somehow
managed
to
scramble
to
his
feet
told
for
an
instant
he
stood
quite
free
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
uncertain
assassins
whose
cowardice
gave
him
time
to
whip
out
his
pistol
but
before
he
could
level
it
a
man
was
on
his
back
his
wrist
was
seized
and
the
weapon
twisted
from
his
grasp
a
cry
of
triumph
was
echoed
by
exclamations
of
alarm
as
disarmed
duchemin
was
again
left
free
the
thugs
standing
back
to
let
the
pistol
do
its
work
in
that
instant
a
broad
sword
of
light
swung
round
a
nearby
corner
and
smote
the
group
the
twin
glaring
eyes
of
a
motor
car
flooded
with
radiance
that
tableau
of
one
man
at
bay
in
the
middle
of
the
road
in
a
ring
of
merciless
enemies
duchemin
cry
for
help
was
uttered
only
an
instant
before
his
pistol
exploded
in
alien
hands
the
headlights
showed
him
distinctly
the
face
of
the
man
who
fired
the
same
face
of
fat
features
black
with
soot
that
he
had
seen
by
moonlight
at
but
the
bullet
went
wild
and
the
automobile
did
not
stop
but
drove
directly
at
the
group
and
so
swiftly
that
the
flash
of
the
shot
was
still
vivid
in
duchemin
vision
when
the
car
swept
between
him
and
those
others
scattering
them
like
chickens
simultaneously
the
brakes
were
set
the
dark
bulk
began
to
slide
with
locked
wheels
to
a
stop
and
a
voice
cried
quickly
monsieur
quickly
the
voice
of
eve
de
montalais
in
two
bounds
duchemin
overtook
the
car
and
before
it
had
come
to
a
standstill
leaped
upon
the
and
grasped
the
side
he
had
one
glimpse
of
the
set
white
face
of
eve
en
profile
as
she
bent
forward
manipulating
the
then
the
pistol
spat
again
its
bullet
struck
him
a
blow
of
sickening
agony
in
the
side
aware
that
he
was
dangerously
wounded
he
put
all
that
he
had
left
of
strength
and
will
into
one
final
effort
throwing
his
body
across
the
door
as
he
fell
sprawling
into
the
tonneau
consciousness
departed
like
a
light
withdrawn
viii
in
re
amor
et
al
in
the
course
of
two
weeks
or
so
duchemin
was
able
to
navigate
a
wheeled
chair
bask
on
the
little
balcony
outside
his
bedchamber
windows
in
the
château
de
montalais
and
even
strictly
against
orders
take
experimental
strolls
the
wound
in
his
side
still
hurt
like
the
very
deuce
at
every
movement
but
duchemin
was
ever
the
least
patient
of
men
unless
the
will
that
coerced
him
was
his
own
constraint
to
another
however
reasonable
irked
him
to
exasperation
so
that
these
falterings
in
forbidden
ways
were
really
as
he
assured
eve
de
montalais
when
one
day
she
caught
him
creeping
round
his
room
one
hand
pressed
against
the
wall
for
support
the
other
to
his
side
in
the
nature
of
a
sop
to
his
you
only
got
to
tell
me
not
to
do
a
thing
often
enough
he
commented
as
she
led
him
back
to
his
chair
to
fill
me
with
unholy
desire
to
do
it
if
i
die
in
the
attempt
is
that
a
rather
common
human
failing
she
asked
wheeling
the
invalid
chair
through
one
of
the
french
windows
to
the
balcony
that
what
makes
it
all
seem
so
unfair
smiling
the
woman
turned
the
back
of
the
chair
to
the
brightest
glare
of
sunshine
draped
a
light
rug
over
the
invalid
knees
and
seated
herself
in
a
wicker
chair
facing
him
makes
all
what
seem
so
unfair
the
indignity
of
being
born
human
he
accepted
a
cigarette
and
waxed
didactic
the
one
thing
that
the
ego
can
find
to
reconcile
it
with
existence
is
belief
in
its
own
uniquity
i
do
think
she
interrupted
with
a
severe
face
belied
by
amused
eyes
that
sounds
quite
nice
uniquity
because
it
sounds
like
iniquity
they
are
not
unrelated
what
makes
iniquity
seem
attractive
is
as
a
rule
its
departure
from
the
commonplace
but
you
were
saying
merely
it
our
personal
belief
that
our
emotions
and
sensations
and
ways
of
thought
are
peculiar
to
ourselves
individually
that
sometimes
makes
the
game
seem
worth
the
scandal
yes
one
presumes
we
all
do
think
that
but
no
sooner
does
one
get
firmly
established
in
that
particular
phase
of
than
along
comes
life
grinning
like
a
gamin
and
kicks
over
our
pretty
house
of
cards

us
up
to
ourselves

her
eyebrows
i

you
have
shown
me
that
i

one
quality

of

declared

again
to
wrestle
spiritually
with
me
about
the
proper
disposition
of
my
jewels
no
madame
pardon
i
am
contemplating
a
long
series
of
exhaustive
arguments
designed
to
prove
it
your
duty
to
leave
your
jewels
where
they
are
in
all
their
noble
insecurity
this
in
the
firm
belief
that
to
plead
with
you
long
enough
to
adopt
this
course
will
result
in
your
going
and
doing
otherwise
out
of
sheer
perversity
monsieur
humanity
madame
eve
de
montalais
laughed
the
charming
laugh
of
a
happily
diverted
woman
but
spare
yourself
monsieur
i
surrender
at
discretion
i
will
do
as
you
wish
truly
rather
than
listen
to
my
discourse
you
actually
agree
to
remove
your
jewels
to
a
safe
place
even
so
monsieur
as
soon
as
you
are
able
to
get
about
and
the
château
de
montalais
lacks
a
guest
i
will
leave
louise
to
take
care
of
madame
ma
mère
for
a
few
days
while
i
journey
to
paris
alone
but
naturally
taking
your
jewels
with
you
why
else
do
i
go
but
madame
you
must
not
and
why
you
a
woman
travel
alone
to
paris
with
a
treasure
in
jewels
ah
no
i
should
say
not
monsieur
is
emphatic
eve
suggested
demurely
monsieur
means
to
be
rather
than
let
you
run
such
a
risk
i
would
steal
the
jewels
myself
convey
them
to
paris
put
them
in
safe
keeping
and
send
you
the
receipt
what
a
lot
of
trouble
monsieur
would
save
me
if
he
would
only
be
so
kind
as
to
do
as
he
threatens
and
how
amusing
if
he
were
arrested
en
route
duchemin
supplemented
with
a
wry
smile
i
am
quite
confident
of
your
ability
to
elude
the
police
monsieur
do
i
hear
you
compliment
me
if
you
take
it
so
but
suppose
you
were
not
confident
of
my
good
will
impossible
madame
is
too
flattering
one
is
sure
she
is
too
wise
to
put
so
great
a
temptation
in
the
way
of
any
man
monsieur
is
the
reverse
of
flattering
he
implies
that
one
does
not
know
where
one
can
repose
trust
i
must
warn
madame
there
are
those
in
this
world
who
would
call
her
faith
misplaced
doubtless
but
what
of
that
am
i
to
distrust
you
because
others
might
who
do
not
know
you
so
well
but
madame
you
can
hardly
claim
to
know
me
well
listen
my
friend
eve
de
montalais
flicked
away
her
cigarette
and
sat
forward
elbows
on
knees
hands
laced
her
level
gaze
holding
his
it
is
true
our
acquaintance
is
barely
three
weeks
old
but
you
do
injustice
to
my
insight
if
you
assume
i
have
learned
nothing
about
you
in
all
that
time
you
have
not
been
secretive
with
me
the
mask
you
hold
between
yourself
and
the
world
lest
it
pry
into
what
does
not
concern
it
has
been
lowered
when
you
have
talked
with
me
and
i
have
had
eyes
to
see
what
was
revealed
ah
madame
the
nature
of
a
man
of
honour
monsieur
simple
of
heart
and
generous
as
faithful
as
he
is
brave
eve
had
spoken
impulsively
with
warmth
of
feeling
unrealised
until
too
late
now
slow
colour
mantled
her
cheeks
but
her
eyes
remained
steadfast
candid
unashamed
it
was
duchemin
who
dropped
his
gaze
abashed
and
though
nothing
had
any
sense
in
his
understanding
other
than
the
words
which
he
had
just
heard
from
the
lips
of
the
woman
who
held
his
love
as
he
had
known
now
these
many
days
some
freak
of
dual
consciousness
made
him
see
for
the
first
time
in
that
moment
how
oddly
bleached
and
wasted
seemed
the
powerful
nervous
brown
hands
that
rested
on
his
knees
and
he
thought
it
will
be
long
before
i
am
strong
again
with
a
troubled
smile
he
said
i
would
give
much
to
be
worthy
of
what
you
think
of
me
madame
and
i
would
be
a
poor
thing
indeed
if
i
failed
to
try
to
live
up
to
your
faith
you
will
not
fail
she
replied
what
you
are
you
were
before
my
faith
was
and
will
be
afterwards
when
she
did
not
finish
but
of
a
sudden
recollected
herself
lounged
back
in
her
chair
and
laughed
quietly
with
humorous
appeal
to
his
sympathy
so
that
is
settled
i
am
not
to
be
permitted
to
take
my
jewels
to
paris
alone
what
then
monsieur
i
would
suggest
you
write
your
bankers
said
duchemin
seriously
and
tell
them
that
you
contemplate
bringing
to
paris
some
valuables
to
entrust
to
their
care
say
that
you
prefer
not
to
travel
without
protection
and
request
them
to
send
you
two
trusted
men
detectives
they
may
call
them
to
guard
you
on
the
way
they
will
do
so
without
hesitation
and
you
may
then
feel
entirely
at
ease
not
otherwise
you
think
not
otherwise
i
feel
sure
but
why
you
have
been
so
persistent
about
this
matter
monsieur
ever
since
that
night
when
those
curious
people
stopped
here
in
the
rain
can
it
be
that
you
suspect
them
of
evil
designs
upon
my
trinkets
duchemin
shrugged
who
knows
madame
what
they
were
you
call
them
for
my
part
i
find
the
adjective
apt
i
fancy
i
know
what
you
thought
about
them
and
that
is
that
they
rather
led
the
conversation
to
the
subject
of
my
jewels
such
was
my
thought
indeed
perhaps
you
were
right
if
so
they
learned
all
they
needed
to
know
except
possibly
the
precise
location
of
your
strong
box
they
may
have
learned
even
that
how
madame
i
do
know
but
if
they
were
what
you
suspect
they
were
they
were
clever
people
far
more
clever
than
poor
provincials
like
us
she
took
a
moment
for
thought
but
i
am
puzzled
by
their
harping
on
the
subject
of
i
think
they
called
him
the
lone
wolf
now
why
should
they
do
that
duchemin
was
constrained
to
take
refuge
in
another
shrug
who
knows
he
iterated
if
they
were
as
clever
as
we
assume
doubtless
they
were
clever
enough
to
have
a
motive
even
for
that
he
really
existed
this
lone
wolf
he
was
more
than
a
creature
of
fable
assuredly
madame
for
years
he
was
the
nightmare
and
the
scourge
of
people
of
wealth
in
every
capital
of
europe
why
did
they
call
him
the
lone
wolf
do
you
know
i
believe
some
imaginative
parisian
journalist
fixed
that
sobriquet
on
him
in
recognition
of
the
theory
upon
which
apparently
he
operated
and
that
was
that
a
criminal
at
least
a
thief
to
be
successful
must
be
absolutely
anonymous
and
friendless
in
which
case
nobody
can
betray
him
as
madame
probably
understands
criminals
above
a
certain
level
of
intelligence
are
seldom
caught
by
the
police
except
through
the
treachery
of
accomplices
the
lone
wolf
seems
to
have
exercised
a
fair
amount
of
ingenuity
and
prudence
in
making
his
coups
and
inasmuch
as
he
had
no
confederates
not
a
living
soul
in
his
confidence
there
was
no
one
who
could
sell
him
to
the
authorities
still
in
the
end
oh
no
madame
he
was
never
caught
he
simply
ceased
to
thieve
i
wonder
why
i
believe
because
he
fell
in
love
and
considered
good
faith
with
the
object
of
his
affections
incompatible
with
a
career
of
crime
so
he
gave
up
crime
how
romantic
and
the
woman
did
she
appreciate
the
sacrifice
while
she
lived
yes
madame
or
so
they
say
unfortunately
she
died
and
then
so
far
as
is
known
the
converted
enemy
to
society
did
not
backslide
the
lone
wolf
never
prowled
again
an
extraordinary
story
but
is
not
every
story
that
has
to
do
with
the
workings
of
the
human
soul
what
one
of
us
has
not
buried
in
him
a
story
quite
as
strange
even
you
monsieur
deceives
himself
i
am
simply
what
you
see
but
what
i
see
is
not
simple
but
complex
and
intriguing
beyond
expression
a
woman
of
your
sort
walling
herself
up
in
a
wilderness
renouncing
the
world
renouncing
life
itself
in
its
very
heyday
but
hardly
that
monsieur
then
i
am
stupid
i
will
explain
the
sleekly
coiffured
brown
head
bent
low
over
hands
that
played
absently
with
their
jewels
to
a
woman
of
my
sort
monsieur
life
is
not
life
without
love
i
lived
once
for
a
little
time
then
love
was
taken
out
of
my
life
when
my
sorrow
had
spent
itself
i
knew
that
i
must
find
love
again
if
i
were
to
go
on
living
what
was
i
to
do
i
knew
that
love
is
not
found
through
seeking
so
i
waited
such
philosophy
is
rare
madame
philosophy
no
i
will
not
call
it
that
it
was
knowledge
the
heart
wise
in
its
own
wisdom
surpassing
mine
telling
me
that
if
i
would
but
be
patient
love
would
one
day
seek
me
out
again
wherever
i
might
wait
and
give
me
once
more
life
she
rose
and
went
to
the
window
paused
there
turning
back
to
duchemin
a
face
composed
but
fairer
for
a
deepened
flush
but
this
is
not
writing
to
my
bankers
monsieur
she
said
in
a
changed
but
steady
voice
i
must
do
that
at
once
if
i
am
to
get
the
letter
in
post
if
madame
will
accept
the
advice
of
one
not
without
some
experience
what
else
does
monsieur
imagine
i
am
doing
then
you
will
write
privately
and
burn
your
blotting
paper
after
which
you
will
post
the
letter
with
your
own
hands
letting
nobody
see
the
address
and
when
shall
i
say
i
will
make
the
journey
as
soon
as
your
bankers
can
send
their
people
to
the
château
de
montalais
that
will
be
in
three
days
or
less
as
soon
as
your
bankers
can
send
their
people
to
the
château
de
montalais
that
will
be
in
three
days
or
less
but
you
will
not
be
strong
enough
to
leave
us
within
another
week
what
has
that
to
do
this
that
i
refuse
positively
to
go
away
while
you
are
our
guest
monsieur
somebody
must
watch
over
you
and
see
that
you
come
to
no
harm
but
madame
no
i
am
quite
resolved
monsieur
has
too
rare
a
genius
for
getting
in
the
way
of
danger
i
shall
not
leave
the
château
before
you
do
so
i
shall
set
this
day
week
for
the
date
of
my
journey
ix
blind
man
buff
in
short
monsieur
duchemin
considered
convalescence
at
the
chateau
de
montalais
one
of
the
most
agreeable
of
human
estates
and
counted
the
cost
of
admission
thereunto
by
no
means
dear
and
with
all
his
grousing
in
respect
of
which
he
was
conscientious
holding
it
at
once
a
duty
and
a
perquisite
of
his
disability
he
was
at
heart
in
no
haste
whatever
to
be
discharged
as
whole
and
hale
the
plain
truth
is
the
man
malingered
shamelessly
and
even
took
a
certain
pride
in
the
low
cunning
which
enabled
him
to
pose
on
as
the
impatient
patient
when
he
was
so
very
well
content
to
take
his
ease
be
waited
on
and
catered
to
and
listen
for
the
footsteps
of
eve
de
montalais
and
the
accents
of
her
delightful
voice
these
last
he
heard
not
often
enough
by
half
still
he
seldom
lacked
company
in
the
long
hours
when
eve
was
busy
with
the
petty
duties
of
her
days
and
left
him
lorn
madame
de
sévénié
had
taken
a
flattering
fancy
to
him
and
frequently
came
to
gossip
beside
his
bed
or
chair
he
found
her
tremendously
entertaining
endowed
as
she
was
with
an
excellent
and
memory
a
gift
of
caustic
characterization
and
a
pretty
taste
in
the
scandal
of
her
bygone
day
and
generation
as
well
as
with
a
mind
still
active
and
better
informed
on
the
affairs
of
than
that
of
many
a
parisienne
of
the
haute
monde
and
half
her
age
during
the
first
bedridden
week
georges
visited
duchemin
at
least
once
each
day
to
compare
wounds
and
opinions
concerning
the
inefficiency
of
the
local
gendarmerie
for
that
body
accomplished
nothing
toward
laying
by
the
heels
the
authors
of
the
attacks
on
and
duchemin
but
for
all
duchemin
can
say
to
the
contrary
is
still
following
clues
with
the
fruitless
diligence
of
so
many
american
police
detectives
on
the
trail
of
a
bank
messenger
accused
of
stealing
bonds
a
decent
likable
chap
this
as
reticent
as
any
englishman
concerning
his
part
in
the
great
war
duchemin
had
to
talk
round
the
subject
for
days
before
confessed
that
his
record
in
the
french
air
service
had
won
him
the
title
of
ace
and
this
only
when
duchemin
found
out
that
was
at
present
in
his
civilian
capacity
managing
director
of
an
establishment
manufacturing
airplanes
at
the
end
of
that
week
he
left
to
go
back
to
his
business
and
louise
de
montalais
replaced
him
at
duchemin
side
where
she
would
sit
by
the
hour
reading
aloud
to
him
in
a
voice
as
colourless
as
her
unformed
personality
nevertheless
duchemin
was
grateful
and
with
the
young
girl
as
guide
for
the
time
sailed
with
to
newcastle
and
rode
with
him
toward
belle
isle
with
him
frustrated
the
machinations
of
overweening
aramis
and
yawned
over
the
insufferable
virtues
of
that
most
precious
prig
of
all
romance
raoul
vicomte
de
bragelonne
but
the
third
week
found
duchemin
mending
all
too
rapidly
the
time
came
too
soon
when
the
word
held
for
him
all
the
dread
significance
he
assured
himself
that
it
holds
for
a
condemned
man
on
the
eve
of
execution
the
detectives
commissioned
by
madame
de
montalais
bankers
would
arrive
eve
would
set
out
on
her
journey
to
paris
andré
duchemin
must
walk
forth
from
the
château
de
montalais
and
turn
his
back
on
all
that
was
most
dear
to
him
in
life
on
that
last
day
he
saw
even
less
of
eve
than
usual
she
was
naturally
busy
with
preparations
for
her
trip
a
trifle
excited
too
it
would
be
only
the
third
time
she
had
left
the
château
for
as
long
as
overnight
since
returning
to
it
after
her
husband
death
when
duchemin
did
see
her
she
seemed
at
once
exhilarated
and
subdued
and
he
thought
to
detect
in
her
attitude
toward
him
a
trace
of
apprehensiveness
she
knew
of
course
duchemin
at
was
too
well
versed
in
lore
of
women
to
dream
he
had
succeeded
in
keeping
his
secret
from
the
fine
intuition
of
one
of
thirty
but
he
told
himself
a
bit
bitterly
she
ought
to
know
him
well
enough
by
this
time
to
know
more
that
she
need
not
fear
he
would
ever
speak
his
heart
to
her
the
social
gulf
that
set
their
lives
apart
was
all
too
wide
to
be
spanned
but
by
a
miracle
of
love
requited
and
he
had
too
much
humility
and
naivété
of
soul
to
presume
that
such
a
thing
could
ever
come
to
pass
and
even
if
it
should
there
remained
the
insuperable
barrier
of
her
fortune
in
the
face
of
which
the
pretensions
of
a
penniless
adventurer
could
only
seem
silly
he
was
permitted
to
be
about
the
house
in
the
afternoon
and
to
dine
with
eve
and
louise
in
the
draughty
dining
hall
madame
de
sévénié
was
indisposed
and
kept
to
her
room
she
suffered
from
time
to
time
from
an
affection
of
the
heart
nothing
remarkable
in
one
of
her
advanced
age
and
so
no
excuse
for
unusual
misgivings
but
the
presence
of
the
young
girl
in
some
measure
and
the
emotions
of
the
others
in
greater
lent
the
conversation
a
constraint
against
which
duchemin
attempts
at
levity
could
not
prevail
the
talk
languished
and
revived
fitfully
only
when
some
indifferent
impersonal
topic
offered
itself
the
weather
for
example
enjoyed
unwonted
vogue
it
happened
to
be
drizzling
eve
was
afraid
of
a
rainy
morrow
she
confessed
to
a
minor
superstition
she
did
not
really
like
to
start
a
journey
in
the
rain
she
smoked
only
one
cigarette
with
duchemin
in
the
after
dinner
then
excused
herself
to
wait
on
madame
de
sévénié
and
finish
her
packing
it
was
time
too
for
duchemin
to
remember
he
was
still
an
invalid
and
subject
to
a
régime
prescribed
by
his
surgeon
he
must
go
early
to
his
bed
i
am
sorry
mon
ami
the
woman
said
hesitating
after
she
had
left
her
chair
before
the
fire
whose
play
of
broken
light
was
perhaps
responsible
for
some
of
the
softness
of
her
eyes
as
she
faced
duchemin
and
gave
him
her
hand
sorry
our
last
evening
together
must
be
so
brief
i
am
in
the
mood
to
sit
and
talk
with
you
for
hours
if
you
could
only
manage
even
one
madame
she
shook
her
head
gently
with
a
wistful
smile
there
will
never
be
another
night
i
know
i
know
and
the
knowledge
makes
me
very
sad
i
have
enjoyed
knowing
you
monsieur
even
under
such
distressing
circumstances
my
wound
you
tempt
me
to
seek
another
do
be
absurd
he
was
still
holding
her
hand
and
she
made
no
move
to
free
it
but
seeming
forgetful
of
it
altogether
lingered
on
i
shall
miss
you
monsieur
the
château
will
seem
lonely
when
i
return
i
shall
feel
its
loneliness
more
than
i
have
ever
felt
it
and
the
world
madame
said
duchemin
the
world
into
which
i
must
go
it
too
will
seem
a
lonely
place
a
desert
haunted
you
will
soon
forget
château
de
montalais
forget
when
all
i
shall
have
will
be
my
memories
yes
she
said
we
shall
both
have
memories
and
suddenly
the
rich
deep
voice
quoted
in
english
like
almighty
wine
she
offered
to
disengage
her
hand
but
duchemin
tightened
gently
the
pressure
of
his
fingers
bowing
over
it
and
as
he
looked
up
for
her
answer
murmuring
with
permission
she
gave
the
slightest
inclination
of
her
head
his
lips
touched
her
hand
for
a
moment
then
he
released
it
she
went
swiftly
to
the
door
faltered
turned
we
shall
see
each
other
in
the
morning
to
say
au
revoir
with
us
monsieur
it
must
never
be
adieu
she
was
gone
but
she
had
left
duchemin
with
a
singing
heart
that
would
not
let
him
sleep
when
he
had
gone
to
bed
stared
blankly
at
the
last
chapter
of
bragelonne
for
an
hour
and
put
out
his
candle
till
long
after
midnight
he
tossed
restlessly
bedevilled
alternately
by
melancholy
and
exhilaration
or
lay
staring
blindly
into
the
darkness
striving
to
focus
his
thoughts
upon
the
abstract
a
hopeless
effort
trying
to
think
where
to
go
whither
to
turn
his
feet
when
the
gates
of
paradise
had
closed
behind
him
and
knowing
it
did
not
matter
he
did
not
care
that
hereafter
one
place
and
another
would
be
the
same
to
him
so
that
they
were
not
the
place
of
her
abode
the
château
was
as
still
as
any
castle
of
enchantment
only
an
old
clock
in
the
drawing
room
two
floors
below
tolled
the
slow
hours
and
through
the
open
windows
came
the
mournful
murmur
of
the
river
a
voice
of
utter
desolation
in
the
night
he
heard
the
clock
strike
two
and
shortly
after
in
a
fit
of
exasperation
thinking
to
discipline
his
mind
with
reading
lighted
the
candle
on
the
bedside
stand
found
his
book
and
fumbled
vainly
in
the
little
silver
casket
beside
the
candlestick
for
a
cigarette
now
a
sincere
smoker
can
do
without
smoking
for
hours
on
end
as
long
as
the
deprivation
is
voluntary
but
let
him
be
without
the
wherewithal
to
smoke
if
he
have
the
mind
to
and
he
must
procure
it
instantly
though
the
heavens
fall
it
was
so
then
with
duchemin
and
what
greater
folly
could
there
be
than
to
want
a
cigarette
and
do
without
one
when
there
were
plenty
in
the
to
be
had
for
the
taking
he
rose
girdled
about
him
his
took
up
the
candlestick
opened
his
door
the
hallway
was
as
empty
and
silent
as
he
had
expected
to
find
it
he
had
no
fear
of
disturbing
the
household
for
his
slippers
were
of
felt
and
silent
and
the
stairs
were
of
stone
and
creakless
shielding
the
candle
flame
with
his
hand
and
somewhat
dazzled
by
the
light
thus
cast
into
his
face
he
passed
the
floor
on
which
the
three
ladies
of
the
château
had
each
her
separate
suite
of
rooms
and
gained
the
as
noiselessly
as
any
ghost
the
fire
had
died
down
till
only
embers
glowed
faint
under
films
of
ash
like
an
old
anger
growing
cold
with
age
the
cigarettes
were
not
where
he
had
expected
to
find
them
near
one
end
of
a
certain
table
duchemin
put
down
the
candlestick
and
moved
toward
the
other
end
discovering
the
box
he
sought
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
to
the
light
in
the
same
breath
this
last
went
out
he
stood
for
a
moment
transfixed
in
astonishment
there
were
no
windows
open
no
draughts
that
he
could
feel
nothing
to
account
for
the
flame
expiring
as
it
had
suddenly
without
one
flicker
of
warning
an
insane
thing
to
happen
to
one
at
such
an
hour
in
such
a
place
involuntarily
memory
harked
back
to
the
night
of
his
first
dinner
in
the
château
when
the
shadows
had
danced
so
weirdly
and
the
strange
notion
had
come
to
him
that
they
were
like
famished
spectres
greedy
of
the
lights
yearning
to
spring
and
snatch
and
feed
upon
them
as
wolves
might
snatch
at
chops
a
mad
fancy
when
he
turned
hack
to
relight
the
candle
it
was
gone
at
least
he
must
have
been
mistaken
as
to
the
exact
spot
where
he
had
placed
it
perplexed
he
pawed
over
all
that
end
of
the
table
but
no
candlestick
was
there
he
straightened
up
sharply
and
stood
quite
still
listening
no
sound
his
vision
spent
itself
fruitlessly
against
the
blackness
which
the
closed
window
draperies
rendered
absolute
but
for
those
dull
sardonic
eyes
of
dying
embers
in
spite
of
himself
he
knew
a
moment
when
flesh
crawled
and
the
hair
seemed
to
stir
upon
the
scalp
for
duchemin
knew
he
was
not
alone
there
was
something
else
in
the
room
with
him
something
nameless
stealthy
silent
sinister
having
knowledge
of
him
where
he
stood
and
what
he
was
while
he
knew
nothing
of
it
only
that
it
was
there
keeping
surveillance
over
him
itself
unseen
in
its
cloak
of
darkness
then
with
a
resolute
effort
of
will
he
mastered
his
imagination
reminding
himself
that
spirits
gifted
in
the
matter
of
moving
material
objects
such
as
candlesticks
frequent
only
the
booths
of
seance
mediums
without
a
sound
he
stepped
back
one
pace
then
two
to
one
side
away
from
the
table
they
were
long
strides
when
he
paused
he
was
well
away
from
the
spot
where
he
had
stood
when
the
light
was
extinguished
and
where
consequently
a
hostile
move
might
be
expected
to
develop
otherwise
his
plight
was
little
bettered
he
did
not
quite
know
where
he
was
in
relation
to
the
doors
and
the
pieces
which
furnished
the
room
that
habit
of
memorising
the
arrangement
of
furniture
in
a
room
immediately
on
entering
it
had
failed
through
disuse
in
course
of
years
he
was
acquainted
with
the
plot
of
this
in
a
general
way
but
by
no
means
with
such
accuracy
as
was
needed
to
serve
him
now
so
he
waited
straining
to
cheat
that
opaque
pall
of
night
of
one
little
hint
as
to
his
whereabouts
who
had
removed
the
light
resurrecting
another
old
trick
he
measured
time
by
and
stood
unstirring
and
all
but
breathless
for
three
full
minutes
but
perceptions
stimulated
to
extra
sensibility
by
apprehension
of
danger
detected
nothing
and
his
hearing
was
so
keen
he
told
himself
no
breath
could
have
been
drawn
in
that
time
without
his
having
knowledge
of
it
still
he
knew
he
was
not
alone
somewhere
in
that
encompassing
murk
an
alien
and
inimical
intelligence
skulked
baffled
by
powers
of
patience
and
immobility
that
mocked
his
own
he
moved
again
edging
toward
the
a
progress
so
gradual
he
could
have
sworn
it
must
be
imperceptible
yet
he
had
a
feeling
a
suspicion
perhaps
merely
a
fear
that
he
did
not
stir
a
finger
without
the
other
knowledge
a
hand
extended
about
a
foot
encountered
the
back
of
an
upholstered
chair
which
he
identified
by
touch
assuming
the
chair
to
be
occupying
its
usual
position
he
need
only
continue
in
a
line
parallel
with
the
line
of
its
back
to
find
the
in
about
six
paces
within
three
he
stopped
dead
as
if
paralysed
by
sudden
instinctive
perception
of
that
other
presence
close
by
whether
he
had
drawn
near
to
it
inch
by
inch
or
whether
it
seeing
him
about
to
make
good
his
escape
had
crept
up
on
him
he
could
not
say
he
only
knew
that
it
was
there
within
waiting
tense
prepared
and
somehow
deadly
in
its
animosity
digging
the
nails
deep
into
the
palms
of
his
hands
until
the
pain
relieved
his
nervous
tension
he
waited
once
more
one
minute
two
three
but
nothing
then
very
slowly
he
lifted
an
arm
and
swept
it
before
him
right
and
left
at
one
point
of
the
arc
a
trifle
to
his
left
his
brushed
something
he
thought
he
detected
a
stir
in
the
darkness
a
stifled
sound
stepped
forward
quickly
clawing
the
air
and
caught
between
his
fingers
a
wisp
of
some
material
like
silk
sheer
and
glacé
a
portion
of
some
garment
simultaneously
he
heard
a
smothered
cry
of
anger
or
alarm
and
the
night
seemed
to
split
and
be
rent
into
fragments
by
a
thousand
shooting
needles
of
coloured
flame
smitten
brutally
on
the
point
of
the
jaw
his
head
jerked
back
he
reeled
and
fell
against
a
chair
which
went
to
the
floor
with
a
muffled
crash
x
but
as
a
mustard
seed
duchemin
woke
up
in
his
bed
glare
of
sunlight
in
his
eyes
from
the
latter
circumstance
he
reckoned
rather
groggily
it
must
be
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
for
not
till
about
that
time
did
the
sun
work
round
to
the
windows
still
heavy
with
lees
of
slumber
his
wits
occupied
themselves
sluggishly
with
questions
concerning
the
enervation
that
oppressed
him
the
reason
for
his
oversleeping
why
he
had
not
been
called
then
reminded
that
noon
was
the
hour
set
for
eve
departure
fear
lest
she
get
away
without
his
bon
voyage
brought
him
sharply
up
in
a
sitting
position
he
groaned
aloud
and
with
both
hands
clutched
temples
that
promised
to
split
with
pain
that
crashed
between
them
stroke
upon
stroke
like
blows
of
a
mighty
hammer
a
neatly
fastened
bandage
held
in
place
above
one
ear
a
wad
of
cotton
once
saturated
with
arnica
now
dry
duchemin
removed
these
and
with
gingerly
fingers
explored
discovering
a
noble
swelling
on
the
side
of
his
head
where
the
cotton
had
been
placed
also
his
jaw
was
stiff
and
developed
a
protesting
ache
whenever
he
opened
his
mouth
then
duchemin
remembered
that
is
to
say
he
recalled
clearly
all
that
had
led
up
to
that
vicious
blow
from
out
of
the
darkness
which
had
found
his
jaw
with
such
surprising
accuracy
and
he
was
visited
by
one
or
two
rather
indefinite
memories
of
subsequent
events
he
remembered
labouring
up
the
stairs
half
walking
half
supported
by
the
strong
arms
of
the
footman
jean
who
was
in
shirt
trousers
and
slippers
only
while
in
front
of
them
moved
the
shape
of
madame
de
montalais
en
négligée
carrying
a
lighted
candle
and
constantly
looking
back
then
he
had
an
impression
of
being
lifted
into
his
bed
by
jean
and
of
having
his
head
and
shoulders
raised
by
the
same
arms
some
time
later
so
that
he
might
drink
a
draught
of
some
concoction
with
a
pleasant
aromatic
taste
and
odour
in
a
glass
held
to
his
lips
by
eve
de
montalais
and
then
duchemin
had
a
faint
smile
of
appreciation
for
a
mental
parallel
to
the
technique
of
the
cinema
a
singularly
vivid
and
disturbing
memory
of
her
face
of
loveliness
exquisitely
tender
and
compassionate
bended
so
near
to
his
faded
away
into
a
dense
blank
of
sleep
somewhat
to
his
surprise
he
found
the
watch
on
his
wrist
ticking
away
as
callously
as
though
its
owner
had
not
experienced
a
prolonged
lapse
of
consciousness
it
told
him
that
eve
would
leave
the
château
within
another
hour
he
got
up
hastily
grunting
a
bit
though
his
headache
was
no
longer
so
acute
or
else
he
was
growing
accustomed
to
it
and
ringing
for
the
ordered
his
petit
déjeuner
before
this
was
served
he
spent
several
thrilling
minutes
under
an
icy
shower
and
emerged
feeling
more
on
terms
with
himself
and
the
world
the
brought
with
his
tray
the
announcement
that
madame
de
montalais
presented
her
compliments
and
would
be
glad
to
see
monsieur
at
his
convenience
in
the
grand
salon
so
duchemin
made
short
work
of
his
dressing
his
and
half
a
roll
and
hurried
down
to
the
seated
in
an
easy
chair
in
the
tempered
light
of
an
awninged
window
which
stood
open
on
the
terrasse
nothing
in
her
pose
she
was
waiting
quietly
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
nothing
in
her
countenance
in
the
brow
the
grave
serene
eyes
lent
any
colour
to
his
apprehensions
and
yet
in
his
heart
he
had
known
that
he
would
find
her
thus
and
alone
no
matter
what
had
happened
her
profound
reverie
disturbed
by
his
approach
she
rose
quickly
advancing
to
meet
duchemin
with
both
hands
offered
in
sympathy
my
dear
friend
you
are
suffering
he
met
this
with
a
smiling
denial
not
now
at
first
yes
but
since
my
bath
and
coffee
i
as
right
as
a
trivet
and
you
madame
a
little
weary
monsieur
otherwise
quite
well
she
resumed
her
chair
signing
to
duchemin
to
take
one
nearby
he
drew
it
closer
before
sitting
down
but
madame
is
not
dressed
for
her
journey
no
monsieur
i
have
postponed
it
a
slight
pause
prefaced
one
more
word
indefinitely
at
this
confirmation
of
the
fears
which
had
been
haunting
him
duchemin
nodded
slightly
but
the
men
sent
here
by
your
bankers
they
have
not
yet
arrived
we
may
expect
them
at
any
moment
now
i
see
said
duchemin
thoughtfully
and
then
may
i
suggest
that
we
continue
our
conversation
in
english
one
never
knows
who
may
overhear
her
eyebrows
lifted
a
little
but
she
adopted
the
suggestion
without
other
demur
the
servants
he
nodded
or
anybody
then
you
have
guessed
broadly
speaking
everything
i
fancy
not
in
any
detail
naturally
but
one
puts
two
and
two
together
i
may
as
well
tell
you
to
begin
with
i
was
wakeful
last
night
and
finding
no
cigarettes
in
my
room
came
down
here
to
get
some
i
left
my
candle
on
the
table
there
as
soon
as
my
back
was
turned
somebody
took
it
away
and
put
it
out
a
few
minutes
later
while
i
was
trying
to
steal
out
of
the
room
i
ran
into
a
fist
yes
she
said
thoughtfully
and
with
some
hesitation
added
i
too
found
it
not
easy
to
sleep
but
i
heard
nothing
till
that
chair
crashed
then
i
got
up
to
investigate
and
found
you
lying
there
senseless
in
falling
your
head
must
have
struck
the
leg
of
the
table
you
came
down
here
alone
i
listened
first
heard
no
sound
saw
no
light
but
i
had
to
know
what
the
noise
meant
still
you
came
downstairs
alone
but
naturally
monsieur
i
do
believe
said
duchemin
sincerely
the
world
holds
a
woman
your
peer
for
courage
or
curiosity
she
laughed
at
all
events
i
found
you
but
could
do
nothing
to
rouse
you
so
i
called
jean
and
he
helped
me
get
you
upstairs
again
where
does
jean
sleep
in
the
servants
quarters
on
the
third
floor
in
the
rear
of
the
house
it
must
have
taken
you
some
time
several
minutes
i
fancy
jean
sleeps
soundly
when
you
came
back
with
him
or
at
any
time
did
you
see
or
hear
nothing
out
of
the
normal
nobody
indeed
i
at
first
believed
you
had
somehow
managed
to
overexert
yourself
and
had
fainted
or
had
tripped
on
something
and
falling
hurt
your
head
later
then
you
found
reason
to
revise
that
theory
not
till
early
this
morning
please
tell
me
well
you
see
it
all
seemed
so
strange
i
could
sleep
when
i
went
back
to
bed
i
lay
awake
puzzled
uneasy
it
was
broad
daylight
before
i
noticed
that
the
screen
which
stands
in
front
of
my
safe
was
out
of
place
the
safe
is
built
into
the
solid
wall
you
know
i
got
up
then
and
found
the
safe
door
an
inch
or
so
ajar
whoever
opened
it
last
night
closed
it
hastily
and
neglected
to
shoot
the
bolts
and
your
jewels
of
course
she
pronounced
with
unbroken
composure
they
have
left
me
nothing
monsieur
duchemin
groaned
and
hung
his
head
i
knew
it
he
declared
no
credit
to
me
however
naturally
whoever
stole
my
candle
and
knocked
me
out
did
break
into
the
house
for
the
fun
of
it
i
imagine
that
what
with
finding
me
insensible
waking
jean
up
and
getting
me
back
in
my
room
you
must
have
been
away
from
yours
fully
half
an
hour
quite
that
long
it
could
have
been
better
arranged
for
the
thieves
he
declared
if
only
i
had
stayed
in
my
room
if
you
had
it
might
possibly
have
been
worse
might
it
the
burglar
or
burglars
knew
precisely
the
location
of
the
safe
they
were
coming
to
my
room
and
if
they
had
found
me
awake
i
think
it
quite
possible
my
friend
that
your
appetite
for
cigarettes
may
have
saved
my
life
there
consolation
in
that
he
confessed
if
it
any
to
you
who
have
lost
so
much
but
perhaps
i
shall
get
my
jewellery
back
what
makes
you
think
that
there
always
the
chance
is
there
and
i
believe
i
have
a
clue
as
they
call
it
an
indefinite
one
but
something
to
work
from
perhaps
what
is
that
it
seems
to
me
it
must
have
been
what
the
police
at
home
call
inside
job
because
whoever
it
was
apparently
knew
the
combination
of
the
safe
you
mean
it
was
broken
open
that
signifies
nothing
i
never
seen
yours
but
i
know
something
about
safes
and
i
undertake
to
open
it
without
the
combination
within
ten
minutes
you
monsieur
duchemin
he
nodded
gloomily
it
no
great
trick
once
one
knows
it
with
an
ordinary
safe
that
is
such
as
you
apt
to
find
in
a
private
home
have
you
looked
for
not
yet
have
you
any
idea
how
the
thieves
broke
in
through
this
very
window
i
imagine
you
see
i
was
up
early
and
in
my
agitation
dressed
hurriedly
and
came
downstairs
hours
before
i
usually
do
the
servants
were
already
up
but
had
opened
the
living
rooms
for
the
day
i
myself
found
this
window
unlatched
the
fastening
is
insecure
you
see
it
has
been
out
of
order
for
some
time
duchemin
was
on
his
feet
examining
the
latch
true
he
said
but
might
not
the
wind
there
was
no
wind
to
speak
of
last
night
monsieur
and
what
there
was
did
blow
from
that
quarter
she
added
as
duchemin
stepped
out
through
the
window
where
are
you
going
to
look
for
footprints
on
the
tiling
it
was
misting
when
i
went
to
bed
and
with
the
mud
but
there
was
a
heavy
shower
just
before
daybreak
if
the
thieves
had
left
any
tracks
on
the
terrasse
the
rain
must
have
washed
them
clean
away
i
have
already
looked
with
a
baffled
gesture
duchemin
turned
back
to
her
side
you
have
communicated
with
the
police
of
course
she
interrupted
with
an
accent
almost
of
impatience
i
have
told
nobody
but
you
monsieur
not
even
my
mother
and
louise
but
why
i
wanted
to
consult
you
first
and
she
broke
off
sharply
to
ask
yes
jean
what
is
it
the
footman
had
entered
to
bring
her
cards
over
which
eve
de
montalais
arched
her
brows
show
the
gentlemen
in
please
the
servant
retired
the
men
from
paris
madame
yes
you
will
excuse
me
duchemin
bowed
but
one
word
you
can
hardly
do
better
than
put
the
case
in
the
hands
of
these
gentlemen
they
are
apt
to
be
of
a
good
order
of
intelligence
when
selected
to
serve
bankers
you
know
i
understand
she
replied
in
her
cool
sweet
voice
she
went
to
meet
the
men
in
the
middle
of
the
room
duchemin
turned
back
to
the
window
where
standing
in
the
recess
with
the
light
behind
him
he
could
watch
and
reflect
without
his
interest
or
emotions
becoming
too
apparent
and
he
was
grateful
for
that
moment
of
respite
in
which
to
compose
and
prepare
himself
within
an
hour
he
knew
within
a
day
or
so
at
most
he
must
be
under
arrest
charged
with
the
theft
of
the
montalais
jewels
damned
by
his
yesterday
as
much
as
by
every
turn
of
circumstantial
evidence
the
men
whom
jean
ushered
in
proved
to
be
outwardly
what
duchemin
had
expected
of
a
class
only
too
to
him
plain
men
of
the
people
unassuming
and
informed
sceptical
not
improbably
shrewd
hands
in
the
game
of
saluting
madame
de
montalais
with
calculated
ceremony
one
acting
as
spokesman
offered
to
present
their
credentials
duchemin
had
a
start
of
surprise
to
dissemble
when
he
saw
the
woman
wave
these
aside
it
is
not
necessary
messieurs
she
said
i
regret
very
much
to
have
inconvenienced
you
although
of
course
it
will
make
no
difference
in
your
bill
but
i
have
brought
you
here
to
no
purpose
the
necessity
for
my
contemplated
journey
no
longer
exists
there
were
expressions
of
surprise
to
which
she
put
an
end
with
the
words
accompanied
by
a
charming
smile
frankly
messieurs
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
make
allowances
for
the
traditional
inconsistency
of
my
sex
i
have
simply
changed
my
mind
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
openly
more
than
a
little
mystified
the
men
withdrew
the
smile
with
which
she
dismissed
them
lingered
delightful
and
enigmatic
as
eve
recognised
the
stupefaction
with
which
duchemin
moved
to
remonstrate
with
her
madame
he
cried
in
a
low
voice
of
wonder
and
protest
why
did
you
do
that
why
let
them
go
without
telling
them
i
must
have
had
a
reason
do
you
think
monsieur
duchemin
i
do
understand
you
madame
you
treat
the
loss
of
jewels
as
if
it
must
be
a
secret
private
to
ourselves
to
you
and
to
me
possibly
that
is
my
wish
monsieur
he
gave
a
gesture
of
bewilderment
perhaps
she
continued
meeting
his
blank
stare
with
eyes
in
which
amusement
gave
place
to
a
look
almost
apologetic
yet
utterly
kind
perhaps
i
have
more
faith
in
you
duchemin
bowed
his
head
over
hands
so
tightly
knitted
that
the
knuckles
were
white
with
strain
you
would
not
have
faith
he
said
in
a
low
voice
if
you
knew
she
interrupted
in
a
gentle
voice
are
you
sure
what
i
must
tell
you
my
friend
she
said
tell
me
nothing
that
would
distress
you
he
did
not
immediately
reply
the
struggle
going
on
within
him
was
only
too
plainly
betrayed
by
engorged
veins
upon
his
forehead
and
exceeding
pallor
of
countenance
if
you
had
told
those
detectives
he
said
at
length
without
looking
up
you
must
have
known
very
soon
they
must
have
found
me
out
without
too
much
delay
and
who
in
the
world
would
ever
believe
anybody
else
guilty
when
they
learned
that
andré
duchemin
your
guest
for
three
weeks
was
only
an
alias
for
michael
lanyard
otherwise
the
lone
wolf
but
you
are
wrong
monsieur
she
replied
without
the
long
pause
of
surprise
he
had
anticipated
i
should
not
have
believed
you
guilty
dumb
with
wonder
he
showed
her
a
haggard
face
and
she
had
for
him
in
the
agony
and
the
abasement
of
his
soul
still
quivering
from
the
rack
of
emotion
that
alone
could
have
extorted
his
confession
she
had
for
him
the
tender
and
compassionate
that
it
is
given
to
most
men
to
see
but
once
in
a
lifetime
on
the
lips
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
woman
beloved
then
you
knew
i
suspected
how
long
since
the
night
those
strange
people
were
here
and
tried
to
make
you
unhappy
with
their
stupid
talk
of
the
lone
wolf
i
suspected
then
and
when
i
came
to
know
you
better
i
felt
quite
sure
and
now
you
yet
hesitate
to
turn
me
over
to
the
police
no
such
thought
has
ever
entered
my
head
you
see
i
afraid
you
do
quite
understand
me
i
have
faith
in
you
but
why
she
shook
her
head
you
must
ask
me
that
at
the
end
of
a
long
moment
he
said
in
a
broken
voice
very
well
i
wo
not
yet
awhile
but
this
great
gift
of
faith
in
me
i
ca
accept
that
without
trying
to
repay
it
if
you
accept
my
friend
you
repay
no
said
michael
lanyard
that
not
enough
your
jewels
must
come
back
to
you
if
i
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
find
them
and
undying
vanity
would
out
if
there
anyone
living
who
can
find
them
for
you
it
is
i
xi
au
revoir
early
in
the
afternoon
eve
de
montalais
made
it
possible
for
lanyard
to
examine
the
safe
in
her
boudoir
without
exciting
comment
in
the
household
he
was
nearly
an
hour
thus
engaged
but
brought
back
to
the
in
addition
to
the
heavy
magnifying
glass
which
he
had
requisitioned
to
eke
out
his
eyesight
only
a
face
of
disappointment
nothing
he
retorted
to
eve
evidently
a
gentleman
of
rigidly
formal
habits
our
friend
of
last
night
would
dream
of
calling
at
any
hour
without
his
gloves
on
i
been
over
every
inch
of
the
safe
outside
and
in
and
the
frame
of
the
screen
too
but
nothing
however
i
been
thinking
a
bit
as
well
i
hope
to
some
purpose
the
woman
nodded
intently
as
he
drew
up
his
chair
and
sat
down
you
have
made
a
plan
she
stated
rather
than
enquired
i
wo
call
it
that
not
yet
we
got
too
little
to
go
on
but
one
or
two
things
seem
fairly
obvious
therefore
must
not
be
left
out
of
consideration
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
whitaker
monk
and
his
lot
had
a
hand
in
this
ah
you
think
that
i
admit
i
unfair
but
first
they
quarrel
with
my
sense
of
the
normal
by
being
too
confoundedly
picturesque
too
rich
and
brilliant
too
sharp
and
smart
and
glib
too
well
theatrical
like
characters
from
the
cast
of
what
your
american
theatre
calls
a
crook
melodrama
and
then
if
their
intentions
were
so
blessed
pure
and
praiseworthy
what
right
had
they
to
make
so
many
ambiguous
gestures
leading
the
talk
up
to
my
jewels
you
mean
i
mean
every
move
they
made
all
too
suspiciously
smooth
too
well
rehearsed
in
effect
that
stop
to
dine
in
nant
with
the
storm
coming
on
when
they
could
easily
have
made
millau
before
it
broke
what
else
was
that
for
but
to
stage
a
at
your
door
at
a
time
when
it
would
be
reasonable
to
beg
the
shelter
and
hospitality
of
your
roof
then
madame
la
comtesse
de
lorgnes
whoever
is
must
get
her
feet
wet
an
excellent
excuse
for
asking
to
be
introduced
to
your
boudoir
so
she
may
change
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
incidentally
spy
out
the
precise
location
of
your
safe
and
when
their
ear
is
hauled
into
the
garage
phinuit
must
go
to
help
which
gives
him
a
chance
to
stroll
at
leisure
through
the
lower
part
of
the
house
and
note
every
easy
way
of
breaking
in
monk
casually
notes
your
likeness
to
the
little
girl
he
once
met
says
in
your
father
office
something
you
tell
me
you
do
recall
at
all
and
that
places
you
as
the
veritable
owner
of
the
anstruther
jewels
and
no
mistake
then
madame
de
lorgnes
guiding
the
conversation
by
secret
signals
which
i
intercept
somebody
recognises
me
as
the
lone
wolf
in
spite
of
the
work
of
years
and
a
beard
and
you
are
obliquely
warned
that
if
your
jewels
should
happen
to
disappear
it
more
than
likely
the
lone
wolf
will
prove
to
be
the
guilty
party
at
any
rate
they
will
be
ever
so
much
obliged
if
you
believe
he
is
it
save
so
much
trouble
all
around
finally
when
your
what
his
name
albert
dupont
a
name
as
unique
in
france
as
john
smith
is
in
england
when
albert
dupont
tries
to
take
my
life
as
a
simple
and
natural
act
of
vendetta
you
really
think
it
was
that
i
recognised
the
beast
when
he
let
off
that
pistol
at
my
head
i
was
in
his
way
here
and
he
owed
me
one
besides
for
my
interference
at
montpellier
that
night
when
dupont
half
murders
me
and
i
laid
up
on
your
hands
for
nearly
a
month
our
friends
with
designs
on
your
jewels
thoughtfully
wait
before
they
strike
till
i
am
able
to
be
up
and
about
consequently
in
a
position
to
be
accused
of
a
crime
which
no
one
would
put
past
the
lone
wolf
oh
i
think
we
can
fairly
count
monk
and
his
friends
in
on
this
coup
i
am
sure
of
it
said
eve
de
montalais
but
albert
is
he
one
of
them
their
employee
or
confrère
dupont
i
fancy
not
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
believe
he
is
entirely
on
his
own
quite
independent
of
the
monk
party
but
his
attack
on
us
at
montpellier
and
later
on
you
here
coming
at
about
the
same
time
as
their
visit
coincidence
if
you
ask
me
the
weight
of
probability
is
against
any
collusion
between
the
two
parties
please
explain
dupont
is
an
apache
of
paris
the
language
he
used
to
me
when
we
fought
in
that
carriage
at
montpellier
was
the
slang
of
the
lowest
order
of
parisian
criminal
used
spontaneously
under
stress
of
great
excitement
with
no
intent
to
mislead
these
other
people
were
if
anything
but
poor
misjudged
lambs
swell
mobsmen
the
élite
of
the
criminal
world
the
two
castes
never
work
together
because
they
trust
each
other
the
swell
mobsman
works
with
his
head
and
only
kills
when
cornered
the
apache
kills
first
as
a
matter
of
instinct
and
then
thinks
to
the
best
of
his
ability
the
apache
knows
the
swell
mobsman
can
outwit
him
the
swell
mobsman
knows
the
apache
will
assassinate
him
at
the
first
hint
of
a
suspicion
of
his
good
faith
so
they
rarely
if
ever
make
use
of
each
other
you
say
but
possibly
in
this
instance
i
think
not
dupont
was
employed
as
your
chauffeur
you
told
me
upwards
of
a
month
he
had
ample
opportunity
to
familiarise
himself
with
the
premises
and
pass
the
information
on
if
acting
in
connivance
with
those
others
but
we
know
he
did
or
they
would
never
have
shown
themselves
here
in
order
to
secure
information
they
could
have
got
otherwise
i
see
monsieur
said
the
woman
then
you
think
the
thief
may
have
been
any
one
of
the
monk
party
or
several
of
them
acting
in
concert
lanyard
interrupted
smiling
or
albert
not
dupont
unless
i
underestimate
him
gravely
he
is
incapable
of
such
finesse
he
is
a
thug
first
a
thief
afterwards
he
would
have
killed
me
out
of
hand
if
it
had
been
he
who
had
me
at
his
mercy
down
here
in
the
dark
nor
would
he
have
been
able
to
open
the
safe
without
using
an
explosive
that
indeed
is
why
as
i
understand
him
dupont
attacked
you
at
montpellier
if
he
could
have
disposed
of
you
there
he
would
have
returned
here
to
work
upon
the
safe
and
blow
it
at
his
leisure
fobbing
the
servants
off
with
some
yarn
or
if
they
proved
too
troublesome
intimidating
them
killing
one
or
two
if
necessary
but
why
has
he
made
no
other
attempt
you
forget
the
police
have
been
making
the
neighbourhood
fairly
warm
for
him
besides
he
wanted
me
out
of
the
way
before
he
tried
housebreaking
if
he
had
succeeded
in
murdering
me
that
night
i
doubt
he
would
have
burglarised
the
château
soon
after
but
he
failed
the
police
were
stirred
up
to
renewed
activity
and
if
monsieur
dupont
is
not
now
safely
back
in
paris
hiding
in
some
warren
of
montmartre
or
belleville
i
am
much
mistaken
in
the
man
a
type
i
know
well
eliminating
albert
then
there
remains
the
monk
lot
you
are
satisfied
that
one
or
all
of
its
members
committed
the
theft
last
night
not
less
than
two
probably
say
phinuit
at
a
venture
and
his
alleged
brother
jules
the
chauffeur
both
americans
adventurous
intelligent
and
resourceful
yes
i
believe
that
and
your
plan
of
campaign
is
based
on
this
conclusion
that
a
big
name
lanyard
smile
was
diffident
a
plea
for
suspended
judgment
on
his
lack
of
inventiveness
for
a
lame
idea
i
believe
our
only
course
is
to
let
them
believe
they
have
been
successful
in
every
way
and
so
lull
them
into
carelessness
with
a
false
sense
of
security
a
wrinkle
appeared
between
the
woman
eyebrows
how
do
you
propose
to
accomplish
that
she
asked
in
a
voice
that
betrayed
ready
antagonism
to
what
her
intuition
foresaw
very
simply
they
hoped
to
shift
suspicion
on
to
my
shoulders
well
let
them
believe
they
have
done
so
the
waiting
hostility
developed
in
a
sharp
negative
ah
no
but
yes
lanyard
insisted
it
so
simple
nobody
here
knows
as
yet
that
your
jewels
have
been
stolen
only
you
and
i
very
well
you
will
not
discover
your
loss
and
announce
it
till
morning
by
that
time
andré
duchemin
will
have
disappeared
mysteriously
the
room
to
which
he
will
retire
will
be
found
vacant
in
the
morning
his
bed
unslept
in
obviously
the
scoundrel
would
not
fly
the
château
between
two
suns
without
a
motive
inform
the
police
of
the
fact
and
let
them
draw
their
own
conclusions
before
evening
all
france
will
know
that
andré
duchemin
is
suspected
of
stealing
the
montalais
jewels
and
is
a
fugitive
from
justice
no
monsieur
the
woman
iterated
decidedly
you
will
observe
he
continued
lightly
persuasive
it
is
andré
duchemin
who
will
be
accused
madame
not
michael
lanyard
never
the
lone
wolf
the
heart
of
man
is
in
truth
a
dark
forest
and
vanity
the
only
light
to
guide
us
through
its
mazes
i
confess
i
am
jealous
of
my
reputation
as
a
reformed
character
but
andré
duchemin
is
merely
a
name
a
nom
de
guerre
you
may
saddle
him
with
all
the
crimes
in
the
calendar
if
you
like
and
welcome
for
when
i
say
he
will
disappear
i
mean
it
quite
literally
andré
duchemin
will
nevermore
be
heard
of
in
this
world
she
had
a
smile
quivering
on
her
lips
yet
shook
her
head
monsieur
forgets
i
learned
to
know
him
under
the
name
of
duchemin
ah
madame
do
not
make
me
think
too
kindly
of
the
poor
fellow
for
whether
we
like
it
or
not
he
is
doomed
and
if
madame
in
her
charity
means
to
continue
to
know
me
it
must
be
michael
lanyard
whom
she
suffers
to
claim
a
little
portion
of
her
friendship
her
smile
grew
wistful
with
a
tenderness
he
had
the
grace
not
to
recognise
abashed
incredulous
he
turned
aside
his
gaze
then
without
warning
he
found
her
hand
at
rest
in
his
more
than
a
little
monsieur
more
than
a
little
friendship
only
he
closed
the
hand
in
both
his
own
then
be
kind
to
me
madame
be
still
more
kind
give
me
this
chance
to
find
and
restore
your
jewels
it
is
the
only
way
this
plan
of
mine
if
we
adopt
it
no
one
will
suffer
only
an
old
alias
that
is
no
longer
useful
if
we
do
not
adopt
it
i
may
not
succeed
for
the
true
authors
of
this
crime
may
prove
too
wary
for
me
and
the
end
will
be
that
my
best
friends
will
believe
the
worst
of
me
even
you
madame
even
you
will
not
be
sure
your
faith
was
not
misplaced
enough
the
woman
begged
in
a
stifled
voice
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
if
you
will
have
it
so
she
sought
to
take
away
her
hand
but
lanyard
kissed
it
before
he
let
it
go
and
immediately
she
rose
with
a
murmured
half
articulate
excuse
and
went
from
the
room
leaving
him
to
struggle
with
himself
and
that
which
was
in
him
which
was
stronger
than
himself
his
hunger
for
her
love
to
deny
stubbornly
the
evidence
of
his
senses
and
end
by
persuading
himself
against
his
will
that
he
was
nothing
to
her
more
than
an
object
of
common
kindness
such
as
she
would
extend
to
anyone
in
similar
plight
because
he
never
could
be
more
those
few
last
hours
in
the
château
passed
swiftly
enough
most
of
them
in
making
plans
for
his
escape
something
which
demanded
a
deal
of
puzzling
over
maps
and
railway
guides
in
the
seclusion
of
his
room
since
the
next
noon
must
find
andré
duchemin
a
criminal
published
and
proscribed
he
had
need
to
utilise
every
shred
of
cunning
at
his
command
if
he
were
to
reach
paris
without
being
arrested
and
without
undue
loss
of
time
to
take
a
train
at
millau
would
be
simply
to
invite
pursuit
for
that
was
the
likeliest
point
an
escaping
criminal
would
strike
for
a
stopping
place
for
all
trains
north
and
southbound
telegraphic
advices
would
cause
every
such
train
to
be
searched
to
a
certainty
furthermore
lanyard
had
no
desire
to
enter
paris
by
the
direct
route
from
millau
not
the
police
alone
but
others
enemies
even
more
dangerous
might
be
expecting
him
by
that
route
on
the
other
hand
the
nearest
railway
station
was
equally
out
of
the
question
since
to
gain
it
one
must
pass
through
nant
where
andré
duchemin
was
known
and
risk
being
seen
while
at
itself
the
station
people
would
be
apt
to
remember
the
monsieur
who
had
recently
created
a
sensation
by
despatching
a
code
telegram
to
london
there
was
nothing
for
it
then
but
a
walk
due
west
across
the
causse
larzac
by
night
to
tournemire
where
one
could
get
trains
in
any
one
of
four
directions
constraint
marked
that
last
dinner
with
eve
de
montalais
they
were
alone
louise
was
dining
by
the
bedside
of
madame
de
sévénié
who
remained
indisposed
a
shade
more
so
than
yesterday
the
ill
health
of
this
poor
lady
indeed
was
the
excuse
eve
had
given
for
putting
off
her
trip
to
paris
their
talk
was
framed
in
stilted
phrases
inconsecutive
they
dared
not
converse
naturally
each
fearing
to
say
too
little
or
too
much
for
the
memory
of
that
surge
of
emotion
transient
though
it
had
been
in
which
their
discussion
had
culminated
that
afternoon
stood
between
them
like
a
warning
ghost
an
implacable
finger
sealing
its
lips
and
theirs
with
the
sign
of
silence
but
talk
they
must
for
the
benefit
of
the
servants
and
talk
they
did
after
an
uneasy
fashion
making
specious
arrangements
for
departure
on
the
morrow
when
eve
was
to
drive
him
to
millau
to
catch
the
afternoon
rapide
for
paris
nor
was
it
much
better
after
dinner
in
the
consciousness
of
each
other
and
consciousness
of
self
as
each
fought
to
master
the
emotions
inspired
by
thoughts
of
their
near
parting
drove
both
into
the
refuge
of
a
dry
insincere
cool
impersonality
lanyard
communicated
nothing
of
his
plans
though
aware
his
failure
to
do
so
might
be
misconstrued
instil
an
instinctive
if
possibly
unconscious
resentment
to
render
the
situation
still
more
difficult
the
truth
was
he
could
barely
trust
himself
to
speak
lest
mere
words
work
on
his
guard
like
tiny
streams
that
sap
the
strength
of
the
dike
till
it
breaks
and
looses
the
pent
and
devastating
seas
at
half
past
nine
ending
a
long
silence
lanyard
sat
forward
in
his
chair
hesitated
and
covered
his
hesitation
by
lighting
a
cigarette
i
must
go
now
he
said
puffing
out
the
match
he
was
aware
of
her
almost
imperceptible
start
of
surprise
so
soon
she
breathed
the
moon
rises
not
long
after
ten
and
i
want
to
get
away
without
being
seen
either
by
the
servants
or
by
anybody
who
might
happen
to
be
passing
you
understand
she
nodded
he
lingered
frowning
at
his
cigarette
with
permission
i
will
write
please
when
i
have
anything
to
report
she
turned
her
head
full
face
to
him
letting
him
see
her
fluttering
indulgent
smile
you
must
wait
for
that
perhaps
he
faltered
at
least
i
hope
it
wo
be
long
you
must
wait
for
that
perhaps
he
faltered
at
least
i
hope
it
wo
be
long
i
shall
be
waiting
she
told
him
simply
watching
every
post
for
word
from
you
i
sha
worry
only
for
you
he
got
up
slowly
from
his
chair
and
stood
half
choking
with
unutterable
words
i
know
no
way
to
thank
you
he
managed
to
say
at
last
for
what
for
everything

what
are
those

she
demanded
with
a
nervous
little
laugh
words
just
words
that
you
and
i
use
to
hide
behind
like
timid
children
she
rose
suddenly
and
offered
him
her
hand
but
i
think
it
any
use
my
friend
i
quite
sure
that
neither

no

nothing

the

we

go
now
her
fingers
tightened
round
his
but
do
stay
away
any
longer
than
you
must
do

by
silly
traditions
false
and
foolish
standards
when
you
think

now
she
freed
her
hand
and
turned
away
but
oh
come
safely
back
to
me
my
dear
xii
travels
with
an
assassin
under
a
sky
whose
misty
silver
pulsed
with
waves
of
violet
light
and
dim
glimmerings
of
gold
lanyard
grey
with
the
dust
and
weariness
of
twenty
leagues
of
heavy
walking
trudged
into
the
sleeping
streets
of
the
town
of
tournemire
in
the
railway
station
whose
buvette
served
him
such
listless
refreshment
as
one
may
find
at
railway
and
nowhere
else
the
world
over
a
train
was
waiting
with
an
apathetic
crew
and
a
sprinkling
of
sleepy
passengers
for
the
most
part
farm
and
village
folk
of
the
department
there
was
nowhere
in
evidence
any
figure
resembling
that
of
an
agent
de
police
lanyard
made
enquiry
found
that
the
train
was
destined
for
le
vigan
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
cévennes
and
purchased
a
ticket
for
that
point
making
himself
as
comfortable
as
might
be
in
a
depressingly
compartment
there
was
no
first
class
and
the
third
was
far
too
richly
flavoured
for
his
stomach
he
cultivated
a
doze
as
the
train
pulled
out
but
driven
as
provincial
trains
habitually
are
in
a
high
spirit
of
its
first
stop
woke
him
up
with
a
series
of
savage
jolts
which
were
translated
into
jerks
when
it
started
on
again
and
fiendishly
reiterated
at
every
suspicion
of
a
on
the
course
so
that
he
presently
abandoned
all
hope
of
sleep
and
sought
solace
in
tobacco
and
the
shifting
views
afforded
by
the
windows
penetrating
the
upper
valley
of
the
cernon
the
railroad
skirted
the
southern
boundary
of
the
causse
larzac
then
laboriously
climbed
up
to
the
plateau
itself
and
lanyard
roused
to
the
fact
that
he
was
approaching
familiar
ground
from
a
new
angle
the
next
stop
would
be
the
day
was
still
in
its
infancy
when
that
halt
was
made
aside
from
the
station
agent
not
a
soul
waited
upon
the
platform
but
one
or
two
passengers
were
set
down
and
as
the
engine
began
to
snort
anew
a
man
darted
from
behind
the
tiny
structure
that
housed
and
galloped
heavily
across
the
platform
and
with
nothing
to
spare
threw
himself
into
the
compartment
immediately
behind
that
wherein
lanyard
sat
alone
this
manoeuvre
was
performed
so
briskly
and
unexpectedly
that
lanyard
caught
barely
a
glimpse
of
the
fellow
but
one
glimpse
was
enough
to
convince
him
he
had
been
wrong
in
assuming
that
monsieur
albert
dupont
had
sneaked
back
to
paris
to
hide
from
the
authorities
after
failing
to
assassinate
andré
duchemin
more
than
three
weeks
ago
but
why
assuming
one
were
not
misled
by
a
chance
likeness
to
that
heavy
but
athletic
figure
so
why
had
dupont
lingered
so
long
in
the
neighbourhood
in
hourly
peril
of
arrest
and
why
this
sudden
departure
in
the
chill
break
of
dawn
a
move
so
timed
and
executed
that
it
wore
every
sign
of
haste
and
fear
no
reasonable
explanation
offered
in
solution
of
either
of
these
riddles
unless
indeed
it
were
reasonable
to
believe
that
lust
for
vengeance
was
the
ruling
passion
in
the
dupont
nature
that
the
creature
had
hung
about
the
château
in
hope
of
getting
another
chance
at
duchemin
and
had
decided
to
give
it
up
only
on
discovering
inexplicably
at
this
hour
that
the
latter
had
stolen
away
under
cover
of
night
but
lanyard
did
believe
that
neither
did
he
believe
that
dupont
had
had
any
hand
in
the
robbery
of
night
before
last
and
was
now
in
tardy
flight
in
truth
he
did
know
what
to
think
and
the
wildest
flights
of
an
imagination
provoked
by
this
mystery
were
tame
and
timid
in
contrast
with
the
truth
as
he
was
later
to
learn
it
to
an
amateur
in
sensations
there
was
true
piquancy
in
the
thought
that
one
was
travelling
in
company
with
a
thug
who
had
already
had
two
tries
for
one
life
and
would
not
hesitate
to
essay
a
third
in
the
same
coach
separated
only
by
the
thin
partition
between
the
compartments
safe
only
in
the
thug
unconsciousness
of
one
proximity
and
this
without
the
privilege
of
denouncing
the
man
to
the
police
for
to
do
so
now
would
be
to
enmesh
in
the
toils
of
the
law
not
only
albert
dupont
assassin
but
andré
duchemin
charged
with
stealing
the
montalais
jewels
lanyard
would
have
given
something
for
a
in
the
partition
to
be
able
to
study
the
countenance
of
dupont
unaware
that
he
was
under
scrutiny
but
he
had
to
content
himself
with
keeping
vigil
at
the
windows
making
sure
that
dupont
did
not
drop
off
at
some
one
of
those
many
which
the
train
was
so
scrupulous
never
to
slight
monsieur
dupont
however
did
not
budge
a
foot
out
of
his
compartment
before
the
end
of
the
run
and
then
lanyard
purposely
delaying
saw
dupont
get
down
from
the
compartment
astern
and
make
for
the
at
le
vigan
without
a
glance
to
right
or
left
evidencing
not
the
remotest
interest
in
his
late
company
on
the
train
but
rather
a
complete
indifference
an
absolute
assurance
that
he
had
nothing
now
to
fear
and
with
this
a
preoccupation
of
mind
so
thoroughgoing
that
lanyard
was
able
to
edge
up
behind
him
when
he
paused
at
the
guichet
and
eavesdrop
on
his
consultation
with
the
clerk
of
the
ticket
bureau
dupont
desired
ardently
to
proceed
to
lyons
with
the
least
avoidable
delay
under
such
conditions
according
to
the
indicateur
des
chemins
de
fer
his
best
available
route
was
via
nimes
where
the
next
express
from
le
vigan
made
close
connection
with
a
northbound
train
rapide
due
to
arrive
in
lyons
late
in
the
afternoon
there
was
however
this
drawback
or
so
the
clerk
declared
after
a
dubious
summing
up
of
the
disreputable
dupont
ensemble
whereas
one
might
travel
any
class
as
far
as
nimes
the
rapide
for
lyons
carried
only
passengers
of
the
first
class
but
said
dupont
with
other
blasphemy
all
the
world
knew
that
the
sacred
rapides
had
no
sacred
accommodations
for
sacred
passengers
of
the
second
and
third
class
was
he
not
the
peer
of
any
sacred
pig
that
ever
travelled
by
train
in
france
if
not
he
proved
the
contrary
to
his
own
satisfaction
by
paying
for
his
ticket
from
an
imposing
accumulation
of
french
then
with
half
an
hour
to
wait
he
lumbered
into
the
buvette
and
gorged
while
lanyard
having
secured
his
own
transportation
for
lyons
by
the
some
route
skulked
in
the
offing
and
kept
a
close
eye
on
the
gourmand
having
eaten
ferociously
dupont
came
out
slouched
into
a
seat
on
a
bench
and
his
thick
limbs
consumed
cigarette
after
cigarette
in
most
absolute
abstraction
of
mind
observed
thus
off
his
guard
and
at
tolerably
close
range
with
his
face
clean
of
soot
he
projected
a
personality
so
forbidding
that
lanyard
marvelled
at
the
guilelessness
which
must
have
influenced
the
ladies
of
château
de
montalais
to
accept
the
man
at
his
own
valuation
and
give
him
a
place
in
their
household
the
face
of
fat
features
was
of
porcine
cast
the
forehead
low
and
slanted
sharply
back
into
bristles
of
black
hair
the
snout
long
and
blunt
the
lips
flabby
the
chin
retreating
the
jowls
pendulous
the
eyes
a
pig
little
cunning
and
predaceous
the
complexion
sallow
and
pimply
from
unholy
living
with
an
incongruous
of
sunburn
a
type
to
inspire
distrust
one
would
think
at
sight
a
nature
as
repellant
as
a
snake
and
ten
times
as
deadly
in
every
line
and
lineament
in
every
move
and
gesture
an
apache
of
the
apaches
as
for
the
baleful
reflections
with
which
dupont
was
patently
concerned
to
the
exclusion
of
all
considerations
of
either
surveillance
or
environment
lanyard
found
himself
so
inquisitive
that
he
had
never
a
thought
but
to
follow
and
study
the
fellow
till
he
surprised
his
secret
if
possible
at
least
so
long
as
it
might
seem
safe
to
do
so
moreover
nothing
could
have
suited
his
own
purpose
better
than
to
proceed
to
paris
by
way
of
lyons
nothing
hindered
the
carrying
out
of
his
design
still
lost
in
thought
and
inattentive
dupont
entrained
for
nimes
and
at
that
station
changed
to
the
rapide
for
lyons
where
duly
at
four
with
lanyard
still
a
discreet
shadow
he
alighted
in
the
gare
de
perrache
here
again
fortune
favoured
the
voluntary
sleuth
the
station
was
well
thronged
a
circumstance
which
enabled
him
to
keep
inconspicuously
close
to
his
victim
furthermore
dupont
was
obviously
looking
for
somebody
and
so
distracted
presently
a
shabby
furtive
little
rat
of
a
man
nudged
his
elbow
and
dupont
followed
him
to
a
corner
where
they
confabulated
in
undertones
for
many
minutes
while
lanyard
loitered
just
outside
their
normal
range
of
vision
an
unnecessary
precaution
they
were
unafraid
of
observation
interested
only
in
their
private
concerns
the
little
man
did
most
of
the
talking
dupont
seeming
content
with
a
listening
rôle
and
gratified
by
what
he
heard
he
nodded
frequently
and
once
or
twice
a
grim
smile
enhanced
the
ugliness
of
his
mouth
a
smile
terrible
in
its
contained
savagery
fit
to
make
one
blood
run
cold
that
cruelly
relished
in
anticipation
the
success
of
some
evil
scheme
not
to
be
able
to
hear
a
word
was
exasperating
to
a
degree
the
smaller
villain
produced
something
a
slip
of
paper
from
a
waistcoat
pocket
and
handed
it
to
dupont
who
examined
it
with
disfavour
shaking
his
head
repeatedly
to
the
other
recommendations
of
a
sudden
he
ended
the
argument
by
thrusting
the
slip
back
into
the
hands
of
the
jackal
growled
a
few
words
of
imperative
instruction
jerked
his
thumb
toward
the
ticket
bureau
and
without
more
ado
turned
and
strode
from
the
terminus
alone
the
little
man
rolled
appealing
eyes
heavenward
then
he
shrugged
in
resignation
and
trotted
over
to
the
guichet
lanyard
now
with
no
fear
of
being
recognised
ranged
alongside
and
listened
openly
it
seemed
that
booked
for
paris
on
the
rapide
to
leave
at
in
the
morning
this
lesser
rascal
had
been
assigned
a
certain
berth
business
of
displaying
the
ticket
identified
by
lanyard
as
the
object
over
which
the
conference
had
split
now
however
it
appeared
that
a
friend
was
to
journey
to
paris
by
the
same
train
but
in
another
it
was
greatly
desired
by
both
that
they
be
separated
no
farther
than
necessity
might
dictate
that
this
reservation
might
be
exchanged
for
another
in
the
same
carriage
with
the
friend
thus
far
without
interruption
from
the
clerk
of
the
ticket
bureau
but
here
ensued
inevitably
the
violent
french
altercation
between
the
two
human
beings
on
either
side
of
the
guichet
then
as
suddenly
as
it
had
arisen
the
squall
blew
over
an
amicable
settlement
was
arrived
at
the
exchange
of
reservation
was
effected
the
small
scoundrel
with
ten
thousand
thanks
and
profuse
assurances
of
deathless
esteem
departed
grinning
lanyard
secured
the
rejected
berth
and
went
about
his
business
profoundly
mystified
but
not
downhearted
beyond
shadow
of
fair
doubt
dupont
was
up
to
some
new
devilment
but
lanyard
would
be
surprised
if
its
nature
failed
to
develop
on
the
train
or
at
latest
upon
its
arrival
in
paris
the
next
morning
for
the
present
he
was
weary
of
the
sight
of
the
fat
apache
glad
to
believe
he
had
seen
the
last
of
him
for
some
hours
he
had
much
to
do
on
his
own
part
nothing
less
in
fact
than
utterly
to
obliterate
from
human
ken
the
personality
of
andré
duchemin
this
affair
involved
several
purchases
for
he
was
travelling
light
indeed
having
left
even
his
rucksack
at
the
château
de
montalais
nevertheless
it
was
no
later
than
seven
in
the
evening
when
he
left
a
room
which
he
had
engaged
in
a
hotel
so
pretentious
and
heavily
patronised
that
he
was
lost
in
its
ebb
and
flow
of
life
an
inconsiderable
and
unconsidered
bit
of
flotsam
and
left
it
a
changed
man
the
pointed
beard
of
monsieur
duchemin
was
no
more
and
a
little
stain
artfully
applied
had
toned
the
newly
exposed
flesh
to
match
the
tan
of
the
rest
the
rough
tweed
had
been
replaced
by
a
modest
and
commonplace
blue
serge
the
cap
and
heavy
brown
boots
by
a
straw
boater
and
plain
black
shoes
the
flannel
shirt
by
one
of
plain
linen
with
stiff
cuffs
and
a
fold
collar
and
neat
foulard
tie
so
easily
was
madame
de
sévénié
buccaneer
metamorphosed
into
the
semblance
of
a
government
clerk
but
this
was
by
no
means
all
the
papers
of
andré
duchemin
were
crisp
black
ashes
in
the
fireplace
of
the
room
which
lanyard
had
just
quitted
all
but
the
letter
of
credit
and
this
last
was
enclosed
in
an
envelope
to
be
sent
to
london
by
registered
post
with
a
covering
note
to
request
that
the
unpaid
balance
be
forwarded
in
french
to
monsieur
paul
martin
poste
restante
paris
paul
martin
being
the
name
which
appeared
on
an
entirely
new
set
of
papers
of
identification
which
lanyard
had
thoughtfully
secreted
in
the
lining
of
the
tweed
coat
before
leaving
london
if
lanyard
wanted
better
testimony
than
that
supplied
by
his
bedroom
mirror
to
the
thoroughness
of
the
transformation
in
his
looks
he
had
it
unsought
and
that
twice
within
an
hour
the
first
time
was
when
leaving
the
hotel
to
seek
the
post
office
and
despatch
his
letter
to
london
he
found
himself
suddenly
face
to
face
with
dupont
who
was
seated
at
a
café
table
near
the
hotel
entrance
and
narrowly
scrutinising
all
who
passed
in
and
out
covering
this
occupation
with
affected
interest
in
the
gossip
of
his
companion
the
little
rat
man
of
the
gare
de
perrache
at
this
rencontre
lanyard
knew
a
momentary
shock
of
doubt
perhaps
he
had
been
so
clever
as
he
had
thought
himself
in
trailing
dupont
all
the
way
from
to
lyons
but
the
beady
little
eyes
of
a
pig
comprehended
him
in
a
glance
and
rejected
him
as
of
positively
no
interest
to
albert
dupont
a
complete
stranger
and
a
cheap
one
at
that
so
he
fared
serenely
on
his
way
and
dupont
gave
him
never
another
thought
returning
lanyard
was
favoured
with
even
less
attention
an
error
in
judgment
which
enabled
him
to
remark
that
dupont
was
in
an
ugly
temper
sullen
and
snappy
it
might
be
because
of
a
disappointment
of
some
sort
possibly
in
consequence
of
the
liberal
potations
indicated
by
the
tall
stack
of
little
saucers
at
his
elbow
as
for
the
lesser
villain
he
was
already
silly
with
drink
one
would
have
been
glad
of
a
chance
to
eavesdrop
again
upon
those
two
but
there
was
no
vacant
place
within
earshot
of
their
table
besides
lanyard
wanted
his
dinner
so
he
the
hotel
and
sought
its
restaurant
where
the
untiring
long
arm
of
coincidence
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
a
table
immediately
adjoining
one
occupied
exclusively
by
monsieur
le
comte
de
lorgnes
and
this
one
in
turn
looked
lanyard
up
and
down
but
detecting
in
him
not
the
remotest
flavour
of
reminiscence
returned
divided
attention
to
a
soup
and
the
door
of
the
restaurant
which
he
was
watching
just
as
closely
and
impatiently
as
dupont
outside
was
watching
the
main
entrance
and
apparently
with
as
little
reward
for
his
pains
but
now
lanyard
told
himself
one
knew
what
had
dragged
dupont
in
such
hot
haste
to
lyons
somehow
word
had
reached
him
probably
by
telegraph
that
monsieur
le
comte
was
waiting
there
to
keep
a
rendezvous
and
if
you
asked
him
lanyard
would
confess
his
firm
conviction
that
the
other
party
to
the
rendezvous
would
prove
to
be
the
person
or
persons
who
had
effected
the
burglary
at
château
de
montalais
so
he
settled
to
keep
an
eye
on
monsieur
le
comte
and
promised
himself
an
interesting
evening
but
as
time
passed
it
became
evident
that
there
had
been
a
hitch
somewhere
de
lorgnes
was
only
human
he
could
rendezvous
all
by
himself
alone
and
nobody
turned
up
to
help
him
out
he
was
fretting
when
lanyard
first
saw
him
before
his
dinner
was
half
served
his
nerve
was
giving
way
continually
his
distracted
gaze
sought
the
door
only
to
turn
back
in
disappointment
to
his
plate
everlastingly
he
consulted
his
watch
his
appetite
failed
the
hand
that
too
often
carried
a
glass
to
his
lips
shook
so
that
drops
of
wine
spattered
the
cloth
like
blood
he
could
not
even
keep
a
cigarette
alive
but
burned
more
matches
than
tobacco
a
heavy
sweat
bedewed
his
forehead
the
ruddy
colour
of
that
plump
countenance
grew
sadly
faded
the
features
drawn
and
pinched
with
worry
by
nine
the
man
was
by
fear
of
the
unknown
by
terror
of
learning
what
fault
had
developed
in
the
calculations
of
his
confrères
efforts
to
fix
his
mind
on
an
evening
newspaper
failed
miserably
and
this
was
not
for
lack
of
interest
in
the
news
it
published
to
the
citizens
of
lyons
for
lanyard
had
a
copy
of
the
same
sheet
and
knew
that
eve
had
loyally
kept
her
promise
a
brief
despatch
from
millau
told
of
the
simultaneous
disappearance
of
one
andré
duchemin
and
the
jewels
of
madame
de
montalais
and
added
that
the
police
were
already
active
in
the
case
at
length
unable
longer
to
endure
the
growing
tension
of
anxiety
and
keep
up
a
pretence
of
eating
de
lorgnes
called
for
his
addition
and
fled
the
restaurant
lanyard
finished
his
own
meal
in
haste
and
arrived
in
the
foyer
of
the
hotel
in
time
to
see
de
lorgnes
settle
his
account
at
the
bureau
and
hear
him
instruct
a
porter
to
have
his
luggage
ready
for
the
rapide
for
paris
in
the
meantime
anybody
who
might
enquire
for
monsieur
le
comte
de
lorgnes
should
be
directed
to
seek
him
in
the
café
thither
lanyard
dutifully
repaired
and
wasted
the
rest
of
that
evening
which
he
had
thought
would
prove
so
amusing
watching
dupont
and
company
watch
de
lorgnes
to
whom
dupont
barely
dissembled
interest
plainly
meant
nothing
at
all
but
whose
mental
anguish
grew
to
be
all
but
unbearable
nor
did
the
quantities
of
veeskysoda
consumed
by
the
unhappy
nobleman
help
him
bear
it
though
undoubtedly
he
assured
himself
it
did
by
midnight
he
was
more
than
and
wholly
in
despair
half
an
hour
later
he
finished
his
eighth
veeskysoda
and
wove
an
unsteady
but
most
dignified
way
back
to
the
foyer
of
the
hotel
immediately
dupont
and
his
fellow
both
markedly
the
worse
for
wear
paid
and
left
the
café
lanyard
returned
to
his
room
to
get
a
travelling
bag
and
started
for
the
train
afoot
a
neat
brown
paper
parcel
under
one
arm
on
the
way
he
made
occasion
to
cross
the
saône
by
one
of
its
dozen
bridges
and
paused
in
the
middle
of
the
span
to
meditate
upon
the
witchery
of
the
night
when
he
moved
on
the
brown
paper
parcel
was
bearing
merrily
downstream
the
mortal
remains
of
andré
duchemin
that
is
to
say
his
discarded
clothing
in
the
gare
de
perrache
lanyard
witnessed
an
affecting
farewell
scene
between
the
little
man
and
dupont
not
much
to
his
surprise
he
discovered
that
the
former
was
not
travelling
to
paris
that
night
after
all
it
was
on
dupont
account
alone
that
he
had
taken
so
much
trouble
to
secure
the
change
of
reservation
and
when
monsieur
le
comte
de
lorgnes
had
wavered
through
the
gateway
in
tow
of
a
porter
and
dupont
had
torn
himself
away
from
his
fond
familiar
and
lurched
after
the
count
and
lanyard
after
a
little
wait
had
followed
in
turn
he
was
able
to
see
for
himself
that
dupont
had
contrived
to
be
berthed
in
the
same
carriage
with
de
lorgnes
proving
that
he
did
not
mean
to
let
the
count
out
of
sight
day
or
night
well
weary
lanyard
proceeded
to
his
own
compartment
in
the
car
ahead
and
turned
in
a
busy
day
and
not
altogether
unprofitable
whatever
expectations
had
been
thwarted
in
this
mild
outcome
one
had
learned
much
and
one
would
resume
the
chase
anew
and
one
rather
fancied
learn
a
deal
more
but
he
was
not
of
those
who
sleep
well
on
trains
in
spite
of
his
extreme
fatigue
he
woke
up
every
time
the
rapide
stopped
he
was
awake
at
dijon
at
four
in
the
morning
and
again
at
laroche
about
a
quarter
after
six
there
peering
out
of
the
window
to
identify
the
station
he
was
startled
to
see
the
broad
back
of
albert
dupont
making
away
across
the
rails
leaving
the
train
it
was
not
feasible
to
dress
and
pursue
even
had
it
been
wise
and
lanyard
was
vexed
dupont
he
felt
was
hardly
playing
fair
after
giving
one
every
reason
to
believe
he
meant
to
go
through
to
paris
and
what
under
heaven
did
the
brute
think
to
accomplish
in
laroche
was
he
still
after
the
comte
de
lorgnes
then
the
latter
must
likewise
have
fled
the
train
or
else
something
sinister
in
the
slant
of
the
dupont
shoulders
as
he
vanished
something
indescribably
evil
in
his
furtive
yet
heavy
tread
of
a
beast
of
prey
struck
a
thrill
of
horror
into
the
mind
of
lanyard
he
shuddered
and
warned
himself
he
must
learn
to
hold
his
imagination
in
better
check
the
newspapers
of
paris
that
day
had
a
sensation
that
crushed
into
insignificance
the
news
from
château
de
montalais
in
a
compartment
which
he
had
occupied
alone
on
the
night
rapide
from
lyons
a
man
had
been
found
with
his
throat
cut
his
clothing
ripped
to
rags
even
his
luggage
slashed
to
ribbons
whether
through
chance
or
intention
every
possible
clue
to
the
victim
identity
was
missing
xiii
athenais
in
london
about
noon
of
that
day
a
gentleman
whom
lanyard
most
often
thought
of
by
the
name
of
wertheimer
deciphered
a
code
message
whose
contempt
for
customary
telegraphic
brevity
was
quite
characteristic
of
the
sender
indeed
a
better
voucher
for
his

the

a
telegram
from

addressed

was
delivered
late
in

heartfelt

poor

keeping

uneasy
about

therefore
cheerfully
delegating
preservation

virtue
while
in

to

maiden
lady
mature
charms
whom
i
beg
you
will
respect
as
you
would
my
sister
wishing
you
enjoyable
intellectual
evening
it
needed
receipt
of
a
while
he
was
dressing
for
dinner
to
cure
lanyard
of
an
attack
of
premonitory
shivers
brought
on
by
recollection
of
the
awful
truth
that
one
is
never
really
safe
in
trifling
with
an
englishman
sense
of
humour
dear
monsieur
martin
it
is
too
sweet
of
you
to
remember
your
promise
to
ask
me
to
dine
the
first
time
you
came
to
paris
since
you
leave
it
to
me
shall
we
say
the
ritz
at
half
past
seven
in
case
your
memory
for
faces
is
poor
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
we
met
has
it
i
shall
be
wearing
the
conventional
fast
black
with
my
very
best
ingenue
expression
and
my
feather
fan
will
be
always
to
you
athenais
reneaux
now
that
sounded
more
like
only
it
was
a
bit
debilitating
to
contemplate
as
the
mirror
insisted
one
must
the
shortcomings
of
evening
clothes
whose
obviously
exorbitant
cost
as
a
luxury
did
nothing
to
make
amends
for
their
utter
want
of
personal
feeling
for
one
needs
sympathy
in
a
quite
as
much
as
cloth
still
it
was
a
tolerably
personable
figure
that
suffered
critical
inspection
and
an
emergency
is
an
emergency
those
readily
serviceable
clothes
were
of
more
value
than
the
most
superbly
tailored
garments
that
could
possibly
have
been
made
up
for
him
in
any
reasonable
length
of
time
for
night
it
might
and
as
lanyard
held
surely
would
be
too
late
to
accomplish
what
he
hoped
to
accomplish
and
for
whose
accomplishment
evening
dress
was
indispensable
since
wertheimer
had
passed
the
word
on
the
name
of
the
comte
de
lorgnes
would
be
published
to
the
world
in
the
morning
papers
and
by
evening
the
birds
if
they
were
wise
would
be
in
full
flight
whereas
while
still
that
poor
mutilated
body
lay
nameless
in
the
morgue
mademoiselle
athenais
reneaux
lived
up
in
most
gratifying
fashion
to
the
tone
of
her
note
in
the
very
beginning
she
demonstrated
excellent
discretion
by
failing
to
be
on
hand
and
eager
when
lanyard
strolled
into
the
ritz
on
the
minute
of
their
appointment
to
the
contrary
she
was
all
of
minutes
late
a
circumstance
so
consistently
feminine
as
to
rob
their
meeting
of
any
taint
of
the
extraordinary
they
might
have
been
simple
sweethearts
meeting
to
dine
remote
from
jealous
or
censorious
eyes
rather
than
one
of
the
most
useful
parisian
agents
of
the
british
secret
service
under
orders
to
put
her
talents
at
the
disposition
of
a
man
who
was
to
her
nothing
more
than
an
everyday
name
she
swept
spiritedly
into
the
lounge
of
the
ritz
a
tall
fair
girl
very
indeed
and
brilliantly
costumed
and
placed
monsieur
paul
martin
in
one
glance
on
the
instant
of
his
calculated
start
of
recognition
at
once
her
face
lighted
up
with
a
charming
smile
few
women
could
boast
teeth
as
white
and
fine
and
almost
before
lanyard
could
extricate
himself
from
his
chair
she
was
at
pause
before
him
holding
his
hand
paul
she
cried
in
lilting
accents
i
so
glad
it
been
simply
ages
and
looking
so
well
i
do
believe
you
changed
a
bit
the
nicely
judged
pitch
of
her
voice
neither
so
high
nor
so
low
as
to
attract
more
than
passing
attention
won
approval
which
lanyard
put
into
the
pressure
of
his
lips
upon
her
hand
and
the
bow
at
once
punctilious
and
intimate
that
accompanied
it
and
you
athenais
always
exquisite
but
truly
one
has
never
seen
you
looking
better
flattery
she
commented
but
i
love
it
meanwhile
her
gaze
that
seemed
so
constant
to
his
eyes
reviewed
other
people
in
the
lounge
in
one
swift
searching
glance
and
returned
to
lanyard
with
a
droop
of
the
lashes
imperceptible
to
all
but
him
that
signified
there
was
no
one
present
likely
in
her
esteem
to
prove
dangerous
to
their
peace
of
mind
flattery
to
you
but
impossible
he
delighted
her
and
she
showed
it
openly
but
her
lips
said
only
have
i
kept
you
waiting
a
frightfully
long
time
poor
boy
let
your
appetite
accuse
you
athenais
but
i
am
starving
then
as
i
take
it
nothing
on
earth
can
prevent
our
going
in
to
dinner
lanyard
had
already
consulted
with
the
maître
over
the
menu
and
the
reservation
as
the
two
settled
down
at
a
table
on
the
side
of
the
room
not
conspicuously
far
from
any
other
in
use
and
at
the
same
time
comfortably
detached
their
iced
melon
was
waiting
to
be
served
always
the
most
thoughtful
of
men
mademoiselle
reneaux
declared
no
fussing
with
the
carte
no
thrusting
it
into
one
hand
and
saying
anything
you
like
my
dear
i
rather
fancy
the
for
myself
that
why
i
adore
dining
with
you
paul
even
if
i
did
adore
you
for
yourself
one
is
well
repaid
when
one
modest
efforts
are
so
well
appreciated
blague
my
friend
sheer
blague
you
know
you
relish
a
good
dinner
of
your
own
ordering
far
more
than
anybody
appreciation
even
mine
the
waiters
had
retired
leaving
them
alone
in
a
momentary
oasis
of
public
isolation
mademoiselle
said
lanyard
in
more
formal
vein
i
am
sure
underestimates
my
capacity
for
appreciation
may
one
venture
to
compliment
mademoiselle
who
is
marvellous
in
so
many
bewitching
ways
why
not
monsieur
was
ever
music
sweeter
the
girl
laughed
then
her
eyes
sobered
while
her
features
retained
their
appearance
of
complete
amusement
monsieur
received
a
telegram
this
afternoon
yes
mademoiselle
and
you
it
is
here
since
i
am
may
i
see
yours
with
a
gay
gesture
she
handed
over
her
telegram
from
london
and
took
his
in
exchange
the
ordinary
cipher
of
the
was
as
readily
intelligible
to
both
as
if
the
messages
had
been
couched
in
open
french
or
english
lanyard
read
kindly
place
yourself
beginning
with
dinner
and
for
duration
his
stay
in
paris
at
the
commands
of
paul
martin
hôtel
chatham
lunatic
but
harmless
and
of
great
value
to
us
he
seems
to
be
at
present
concerned
with
some
affair
outside
our
knowledge
but
presumably
desperate
else
he
would
not
be
interested
please
exert
best
endeavours
to
get
him
out
of
france
alive
as
soon
as
possible
the
girl
was
laughing
as
she
returned
lanyard
telegram
and
received
her
own
charms
she
pouted
intellectual
evening
oh
how
depressing
poor
paul
but
you
must
have
felt
discouraged
i
did
at
first
and
afterwards
disappointed
and
are
you
going
to
obey
that
injunction
to
treat
me
as
sister
never
in
my
life
how
then
as
anybody
wife
perplexity
knitted
a
little
pucker
in
her
delicately
lined
brows
paul
you
could
speak
french
so
well
and
be
an
englishman
i
assure
you
athenais
i
am
mentally
a
native
of
france
she
sighed
luxuriously
what
an
amusing
prospect
and
this
is
the
sort
of
man
at
whose
commands
i
am
required
to
place
myself
not
required
athenais
requested
begged
besought
i
like
that
better
and
she
enquired
demurely
may
one
ask
what
are
monsieur
commands
first
you
will
continue
to
flirt
with
me
as
at
present
outrageously
even
when
you
make
it
so
difficult
and
then
to
waste
an
evening
in
my
society
must
it
be
wasted
that
will
be
as
it
falls
out
and
what
do
we
do
with
this
evening
of
such
questionable
value
we
finish
dinner
here
at
our
leisure
we
smoke
and
chat
a
while
in
the
lounge
if
you
like
or
if
nothing
better
offers
we
go
to
a
play
and
then
you
will
take
me
by
the
hand
if
you
please
mademoiselle
in
the
maternal
manner
appropriate
to
mature
charms
i
presume
precisely
what
then
you
will
always
remembering
that
my
interest
in
such
things
is
merely
academic
you
will
then
lead
me
hither
and
yon
as
your
whim
lists
and
show
me
how
paris
amuses
itself
in
these
days
of
its
nocturnal
decadence
you
will
dutifully
pretend
to
drink
much
more
champagne
than
is
good
for
you
and
to
be
enjoying
yourself
as
you
seldom
have
before
if
i
discover
an
interest
in
people
i
may
chance
to
see
you
will
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
who
they
are
and
other
details
concerning
their
ways
of
life
if
i
know
but
i
am
sure
you
know
everyone
worth
knowing
in
paris
athenais
then
if
i
am
right
in
assuming
you
are
looking
for
some
person
in
particular
you
have
reason
mademoiselle
i
run
the
risk
of
losing
an
entertaining
evening
not
necessarily
besides
there
are
many
evenings
are
you
not
at
my
commands
for
the
duration
of
my
stay
in
paris
true
so
i
will
have
to
chance
my
perilous
question
i
presume
one
ca
help
being
true
to
the
traditions
of
one
sex
inquisitive
you
mean
but
what
else
is
every
thinking
creature
male
or
female
what
are
men
of
science
what
but
it
was
eve
who
first
ah
raking
up
old
scandal
eh
but
i
wager
something
it
was
really
adam
who
taking
a
purely
scientific
interest
in
the
business
egged
eve
on
to
try
a
bite
of
apple
asserting
that
the
domestic
menu
lacked
variety
telling
himself
if
she
died
of
it
it
would
only
cost
him
another
rib
to
replace
her
and
cheap
at
the
price
paul
you
are
too
gallant
wait
till
i
try
to
find
out
something
about
you
directly
or
indirectly
and
see
what
you
will
then
have
to
say
about
the
curiosity
of
women
but
i
should
mind
it
would
be
too
flattering
so
dig
away
i
will
who
is
it
you
looking
for
in
paris
after
midnight
anyone
of
several
people
perhaps
i
know
them
it
might
save
time
if
you
would
give
me
their
names
now
it
is
you
who
ask
me
to
risk
losing
an
enjoyable
evening
but
so
be
it

her

the
names
then
are
probably
fictitious
if
you
could
describe
them
perhaps
useless
i
am
afraid
neither

an
uncommon
type
any
word
picture
of
either

probably
fit

is
quite
possible
he
made
his
money
in

i
believe
the

reflected
or
perhaps
it
was
oil
then
you
do
know
him
i
met
him
one
night
or
rather
one
morning
several
weeks
ago
with
a
gay
party
that
joined
ours
at
breakfast

we
still

an
adventurous
night

nodded
and

sighed
it
is
true
then

ages
his
follies
never
a
quaint
little
stupid
the
girl
mused
pardon
mademoiselle
i
was
thinking
of

quaint
i
grant
you
but
hardly
little
or
stupid
a
tall
man
as
thin
as
a
diet
with
a
face
like
a
comic
mask
of
tragedy

wisely
to

for
a

let
us
get
hence
if
you
do

and

unregenerate
generation

lanyard
and
athenais
reneaux
had
dawdled
over
dinner
and
coffee
and
cigarettes
with
so
much
tacit
deliberation
that
by
the
time
lanyard
suggested
they
might
move
on
it
was
too
late
for
a
play
and
still
a
bit
too
early
to
begin
the
contemplated
round
of
restaurants
also
it
was
too
warm
for
a
so
they
killed
another
hour
at
the
ambassadeurs
where
they
were
fortunate
in
getting
good
places
and
the
entertainment
imposed
no
strain
upon
the
attention
where
too
the
audience
though
heterogeneous
was
sufficiently
and
to
impart
to
a
beautiful
lady
and
her
squire
a
pleasant
consciousness
of
being
left
very
much
to
themselves
in
an
amusing
expression
of
a
civilisation
cynical
and
but
that
was
so
wherever
they
went
that
night
and
in
a
sense
they
went
everywhere
in
no
city
in
the
world

the
doctrine
of
more
studiously
inculcated
by
example
than
in
paris
especially
in
its
hours
of
relaxation
lanyard
had
not
been
so
long
an
exile
as
to
have
forgotten
his
way
about
entirely
and
with
what
was
new
since
his
time
mademoiselle
reneaux
was
thoroughly
acquainted
and
if
he
felt
himself
rather
a
ghost
revisiting
glimpses
of
a
forgotten
moon
if
all
the
odalisques
were
new
to
his
vision
and
all
the
sultans
strange
if
never
an
eye
that
scanned
his
face
turned
back
for
a
second
look
in
uncertain
reminiscence
he
had
to
console
him
the
company
of
a
young
woman
whom
everybody
seemed
to
know
and
admire
and
like
in
none
of
the
resorts
they
visited
did
she
fail
to
greet
or
be
hailed
by
a
handful
of
acquaintances
yet
they
were
generously
let
alone
as
to
that
lanyard
could
not
complain
the
truth
was
that
despite
the
dark
thread
of
sober
purpose
which
ran
through
those
tolerably
purple
hours
he
was
being
excellently
entertained
not
by
this
sad
business
of
scampering
from
one
place
of
dubious
fame
to
another
not
by
any
reckless
sense
of
rejuvenation
to
be
distilled
from
the
practice
of
buying
champagne
at
each
stop
and
leaving
every
bottle
barely
tasted
not
by
those
colourful
dissolving
tableaux
always
much
the
same
in
composition
if
set
against
various
backgrounds
of
women
sitting
with
concupiscent
men
and
swallowing
cold
poisons
in
quantities
calculated
to
spur
them
into
the
frenzy
of
dances
by
none
of
these
but
simply
by
the
society
of
a
woman
of
a
type
perhaps
not
unique
but
novel
in
his
experience
and
intriguing
to
his
understanding
if
there
were
anybody
or
thing
a
girl
of
her
age
athenais
was
about
should
know
she
knew
him
her
or
it
if
there
were
any
place
she
should
go
she
either
went
or
had
been
there
if
there
were
anything
she
should
do
or
say
or
think
or
countenance
those
things
she
within
limitations
did
and
said
and
thought
and
accepted
or
passed
over
as
matters
of
fact
and
no
consequence
and
though
she
observed
scrupulously
certain
limitations
she
never
made
this
obvious
she
simply
avoided
what
she
chose
to
consider
bad
taste
with
a
deftness
and
tact
that
would
have
seemed
admirable
in
a
woman
of
the
great
world
twice
her
age
and
with
it
all
she
preserved
a
sort
of
champagne
effervescence
of
youthful
spirits
and
an
cameraderie
incomprehensible
when
one
took
into
consideration
the
disillusioning
circumstances
of
her
life
her
vocation
as
a
paid
government
spy
trusted
with
secrets
and
worthy
of
her
trust
dedicated
to
days
of
adventure
always
dangerous
generally
sordid
and
like
at
any
time
to
prove
deadly
young
beautiful
admirably
poised
accomplished
and
intelligent
she
should
by
rights
have
been
wrapped
up
in
love
of
some
man
her
peer
in
all
these
attributes
but
she
was
or
she
said
she
was
in
one
of
those
moments
of
gravity
which
served
to
throw
into
higher
relief
the
of
her
badinage
with
lanyard
asserting
an
entirely
willing
disposition
to
stand
aside
and
play
the
pensive
amused
indulgent
spectator
in
the
masque
of
love
danced
by
a
world
mad
for
it
grasping
for
love
greedily
even
in
its
cheapest
shapes
and
guises
if
it
comes
she
sighed
it
will
find
me
waiting
and
not
unwilling
but
it
will
have
to
come
in
another
form
than
those
i
know
about
my
dear
said
lanyard
be
unafraid
it
always
does
she
called
herself
athenais
reneaux
but
she
did
pretend
to
lanyard
that
she
had
no
better
title
to
another
name
her
french
was
of
the
purest
a
delight
to
listen
to
yet
she
was
in
fact
less
french
than
english
her
paternal
forebears
to
the
third
generation
had
lived
in
england
and
married
englishwomen
she
said
and
more
than
this
much
about
herself
nothing
perhaps
deriving
some
gratification
from
leaving
such
broad
fields
of
conjecture
open
to
the
interest
which
an
enigmatic
personality
never
failed
to
excite
but
i
think
you
quite
as
much
of
a
mystery
as
you
pretend
to
see
in
me
it
rather
nice
do
you
think
at
least
it
gives
us
an
interest
in
each
other
aside
from
sentiment
some
day
perhaps
each
know
all
now
god
forbid
are
you
so
afraid
of
learning
my
girlish
secrets
then
i
do
believe
you
i
do
believe
you
even
care
to
hear

protested
in
a
hollow
voice
non
mon
ami
she
judged
him
shrewdly
with
narrowed
smiling
eyes
you
flirt
with
far
too
much
finish
you
know
it
ca
be
done
to
such
perfection
when
the
heart
truly
involved
but
for
one
thing
and
if
only
you
be
a
little
more
tragic
about
your
disappointments
for
you
have
yet
asked
me
a
single
question
about
anybody
met
no
thus
far
we
drawn
every
cover
blank
he
groaned
for
it
was
after
three
in
the
morning
very
well
but
for
this
and
that
i
be
tempted
to
think
you
were
sleuthing
on
the
trail
of
some
female
fair
but
faithless
but
taking
all
with
entirely
too
much
resignation
there
a
contented
glow
in
the
back
of
your
eyes
i
having
a
good
time
it
pretty
of
you
to
tell
me
so
but
that
not
the
reason
for
your
see
here
lanyard
interrupted
sitting
up
and
signalling
to
the
waiter
for
his
bill
if
i
let
you
run
on
the
way
you
heading
you
presently
be
telling
me
something
you
found
out
about
me
and
i
do
want
to
hear
oh
very
well
she
sighed
i
sure
i
do
wish
to
embarrass
you
but
i
will
say
this
men
of
your
uncertain
age
do
go
round
with
such
contented
eyes
unless
they
prosperously
in
love
oh
come
along
lanyard
growled
offering
to
rise
you
know
too
confounded
much
he
waited
a
moment
and
then
as
she
did
nothing
but
sit
and
glimmer
at
him
mischievously
he
added
shall
we
go
where
now
she
enquired
without
stirring
he
had
a
shrug
of
distaste
maxim
i
presume
unless
you
can
suggest
some
other
place
more
likely
and
less
tedious
no
she
replied
after
taking
thought
i
ca
we
covered
paris
pretty
thoroughly
all
except
the
tourist
places
no
good
wasting
time
on
them
then
let
stop
on
here
till
it
time
to
milk
the
cows
but
there
maxim
left
only
another
tourist
show
nowadays
and
frightfully
rowdy
sounds
like
the
lot
i
after
come
along
she
shook
her
head
vigorously
sha
his
eyebrows
rose
in
mute
enquiry
because
i
do
want
to
she
explained
with
childlike
candour
i
tired
of
being
dragged
around
and
plied
with
drink
do
you
realise
i
had
as
much
as
two
and
a
half
glasses
of
champagne
out
of
the
countless
bottles
you
ordered
well
i
have
and
they
doing
their
work
i
feel
the
spirit
of
independence
surging
in
my
midst
i
mutiny
and
defy
you
a
peal
of
laughter
rewarded
the
instinctive
glance
with
which
he
sought
to
judge
how
far
he
was
justified
in
taking
her
seriously
not
only
that
but
neglecting
me
i
want
to
dance
and
you
have
asked
me
in
fully
half
an
hour
and
you
a
heavenly
dancer
and
so
am
i
she
thrust
back
her
end
of
their
wall
table
and
rose
if
you
please
monsieur
one
could
hardly
resent
such
charming
impertinence
lanyard
drew
a
long
face
of
mock
patience
sighed
an
heroic
sigh
and
followed
her
through
the
huddled
tables
to
the
dancing
floor
a
bewildering
look
rewarded
him
as
they
swung
into
the
first
movement
of
a
tango
do
you
know
you
are
a
dangerous
man
monsieur
paul
martin
oh
mademoiselle
such
fortitude
such
forbearance
when
i
ought
to
be
slapped
enchants
disarms
makes
me
remember
i
am
a
woman
foredoomed
always
to
yield
i
abjure
my
boasted
independence
monsieur
i
submit
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
on
to
maxim
after
this
one
dance
you
know
it
the
last
really
good
music
we
have
to
dance
to
our
last
dance
together
perhaps
who
knows
forever
she
pretended
to
be
overcome
the
lithe
body
in
his
embrace
sketched
a
fugitive
seizure
of
sadness
drooping
with
a
wistful
languour
well
suited
to
the
swooning
measures
to
which
they
swayed
and
postured
his
hand
was
pressed
convulsively
she
seemed
momentarily
about
to
become
a
burden
in
his
grasp
yet
ever
to
recover
just
on
the
instant
of
failing
buoyed
up
by
the
steely
resilience
of
her
lithe
and
slender
body
impossible
to
say
how
much
was
pretence
how
much
impulsive
confession
of
true
feeling
perplexed
perturbed
lanyard
gazed
down
into
that
richly
tinted
face
which
with
eyes
and
lips
seemed
to
betray
so
much
yet
to
his
next
glance
was
wholly
illegible
and
provoking
aware
that
with
such
women
man
vanity
misleads
him
woefully
and
aware
that
she
was
equally
awake
to
this
masculine
weakness
he
wondered
afraid
even
to
guess
telling
himself
he
were
an
ass
to
believe
a
fool
to
deny
then
suddenly
he
saw
her
lashes
sweep
up
to
unveil
eyes
at
once
mirthful
and
admonitory
her
hungry
mouth
murmured
incongruously
an
edged
warning
play
up
paul
play
up
to
me
we
dance
too
well
together
not
to
be
watched
and
if
i
not
mistaken
someone
interested
in
has
just
come
in
no
do
look
yet
just
remember
madly
enamoured
you
and
i
and
do
care
a
rap
who
sees
it
strung
by
her
words
into
a
spirit
of
emulation
lanyard
achieved
an
adequate
seeming
of
response
to
the
passion
feigned
or
real
with
which
the
woman
infused
the
patterned
coquetry
of
their
steps
between
lips
that
stirred
so
little
their
movement
must
have
been
indiscernible
he
asked
who
in
the
same
manner
but
in
accents
fraught
with
an
emotion
indecipherable
but
intense
the
reply
came
do
talk
this
is
too
divine
just
dance
he
obeyed
deliberately
shut
out
of
his
thoughts
the
warning
she
had
given
him
and
let
himself
go
body
and
mind
so
that
a
sway
to
the
sensuous
strains
of
that
most
sensuous
of
dances
the
girl
and
the
man
for
a
space
seemed
one
with
music
that
throbbed
of
love
and
longing
desire
and
denial
pursuit
and
retreat
surrender
and
conquest
on
a
sonorous
phrase
it
ceased
a
flutter
of
applause
ran
round
the
tables
lanyard
mastered
a
sense
of
daze
that
he
saw
reflected
in
the
opening
eyes
of
the
woman
as
she
slipped
from
his
arms
in
an
instant
they
were
themselves
once
more
two
completely
children
of
sophistication
with
superb
insouciance
making
nothing
of
their
public
triumph
in
a
rare
and
difficult
performance
on
the
way
to
their
table
they
were
intercepted
by
a
woman
who
with
two
cavaliers
had
since
the
moment
of
her
entrance
been
standing
near
the
door
of
the
restaurant
apparently
spellbound
with
admiration
through
a
rising
clatter
of
tongues
her
voice
cut
clearly
but
not
at
all
unpleasantly
athenais
it
is
i
liane
inured
as
he
was
to
the
manners
of
an
age
which
counts
its
women
not
dressed
if
they
are
not
half
undressed
and
with
his
sensibilities
further
calloused
by
a
night
devoted
to
restaurants
the
entrée
to
which
for
women
seemed
to
be
conditioned
on
at
least
lanyard
was
none
the
less
inclined
to
think
he
had
never
seen
this
side
of
footlights
a
gown
quite
so
daring
as
that
which
revealed
the
admirably
turned
person
of
the
lady
who
named
herself
liane
there
was
so
little
of
it
that
he
reflected
its
cost
must
have
been
something
enormous
but
in
vain
that
scantiness
of
drapery
the
white
body
rose
splendidly
out
of
its
ineffective
wrappings
only
to
be
overwhelmed
by
an
incredible
incrustation
of
jewellery
only
here
and
there
did
bare
of
flesh
unadorned
succeed
in
making
themselves
visible
at
the
sound
of
her
name
athenais
turned
with
a
perfectly
indicated
start
of
surprise
which
she
promptly
translated
into
a
little
joyful
cry
the
living
pillar
of
ivory
satin
and
precious
stones
ran
into
her
arms
embraced
her
ardently
and
kissed
both
her
cheeks
then
releasing
her
to
lanyard
glints
of
trifling
malice
winked
behind
the
open
interest
of
troubling
rounded
eyes
of
violet
lanyard
knew
himself
known
so
he
had
sacrificed
for
nothing
his
beautiful
beard
he
uttered
a
private
but
heartfelt
damn
and
bowed
profoundly
as
the
woman
tapping
athenais
on
the
arm
with
a
fan
crusted
with
diamonds
demanded
present
instantly
my
dear
this
gentleman
who
tangoes
as
i
have
never
seen
the
tango
danced
before
forestalling
athenais
lanyard
replied
with
a
whimsical
grimace
is
one
then
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
been
forgotten
by
madame
la
comtesse
de
lorgnes
with
any
other
woman
than
athenais
reneaux
he
would
have
hesitated
to
deal
so
bold
an
offensive
stroke
but
his
confidence
in
her
quickness
of
apprehension
and
her
unshakable
was
both
implicit
and
for
she
received
this
overt
notification
of
the
success
of
his
quest
without
one
sign
other
than
a
look
of
dawning
puzzlement
madame
la
comtesse
she
murmured
with
a
rising
inflection
but
monsieur
is
mistaken
the
other
stammered
biting
her
lip
surely
one
can
not
have
been
so
stupid
lanyard
apologised
but
this
is
mademoiselle
delorme
athenais
said
monsieur
paul
martin
liane
delorme
those
syllables
were
like
a
spoken
spell
to
break
the
power
of
dark
enchantment
which
had
hampered
lanyard
memory
ever
since
first
sight
of
this
woman
in
the
café
de
at
nant
a
great
light
began
to
flood
his
understanding
but
he
was
denied
time
to
advantage
himself
immediately
of
its
illumination
liane
delorme
was
quick
to
parry
and
riposte
how
strange
monsieur
should
think
he
had
ever
known
me
by
a
name
what
was
it
but
no
matter
for
now
i
look
more
closely
i
myself
can
not
get
over
the
impression
that
i
have
known
monsieur
martin
did
you
say
somewhere
sometime
but
paul
martin
not
unless
monsieur
has
more
than
one
name
then
it
would
seem
that
mademoiselle
and
i
are
both
in
error
the
loss
is
mine
that
gun
spiked
lanyard
began
to
breathe
more
freely
it
is
not
too
late
to
make
up
that
loss
monsieur
liane
delorme
was
actually
chuckling
in
appreciation
of
his
readiness
pleased
with
him
even
in
the
moment
of
her
own
discomfiture
her
eyes
twinkling
merrily
at
him
above
the
fan
with
which
she
hid
a
convulsed
countenance
surely
two
people
so
possessed
with
regret
at
never
having
known
each
other
should
lose
no
time
improving
their
acquaintance
dear
athenais
do
ask
us
to
sit
at
your
table
while
the
waiter
fetched
additional
chairs
the
woman
made
her
escorts
known
messieurs
benouville
et
le
brun
two
extravagantly
insignificant
young
men
exquisitely
groomed
and
presumably
wealthy
who
were
making
the
bravest
efforts
to
seem
unaware
that
to
be
seen
with
liane
delorme
conferred
an
unimpeachable
cachet
lanyard
remarked
however
that
neither
ventured
to
assume
proprietorial
airs
while
liane
attitude
toward
them
was
generally
indulgent
if
occasionally
patronising
and
sometimes
impatient
champagne
frothed
into
fresh
glasses
as
soon
as
the
band
struck
up
another
dance
athenais
drifted
away
in
the
arms
of
monsieur
le
brun
liane
gazed
round
the
room
acknowledged
the
salutations
of
several
friends
signalled
gaily
to
a
pair
of
mercenaries
on
the
far
side
of
the
dancing
floor
and
issued
peremptory
orders
to
benouville
go
and
ask

to
dance
with
you

being
left
to
bore
herself
while

constance

to
afflict

my
confidences

the
utmost
docility

bien

bien
madame
la
comtesse
liane
sipped
at
her
champagne
making
impudent
eyes
at
lanyard
over
the
brim
of
her
glass
by
what
appears
you
have
at
last
torn
yourself
away
from
the
charming
society
of
the
château
de
montalais
as
you
see
that
was
a
long
visit
you
made
at
the
château
my
old
one
madame
la
comtesse
is
well
informed
lanyard
returned
phlegmatic
one
hears
what
one
hears
one
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
foul
of
an
assassin
lanyard
took
the
trouble
to
explain
an
assassin
the
same
apache
who
attacked
with
others
the
party
from
montalais
at
and
you
were
wounded
lanyard
assented
the
lady
made
a
shocked
face
and
uttered
appropriate
noises
as
you
know
lanyard
added
liane
delorme
pretended
not
to
hear
that
last
and
the
ladies
of
the
château
she
enquired
they
were
sympathetic
one
feels
sure
they
were
most
kind
it
was
not
serious
this
wound
no
mademoiselle
may
judge
when
she
knows
i
was
unable
to
leave
my
bed
for
nearly
three
weeks
but
what
atrocity
and
this
apache
remains
at
large
ah
these
police
and
the
lady
described
a
sign
of
contempt
that
was
wholly
unladylike
still
you
are
well
recovered
by
the
way
you
dance
one
can
not
complain
what
an
experience
still
liane
again
buried
her
nose
in
her
glass
and
regarded
lanyard
with
a
look
of
mysterious
understanding
she
resumed
still
not
without
its
compensations
eh
mon
ami
that
is
as
one
regards
it
mademoiselle
oh
oh
there
was
any
amount
of
deep
significance
in
these
exclamations
one
may
regard
that
in
more
ways
than
one
indeed
lanyard
agreed
with
his
most
winning
manner
one
may
for
instance
remember
that
i
recovered
speedily
enough
to
be
in
paris
and
meet
mademoiselle
without
losing
time
monsieur
wishes
me
to
flatter
myself
into
thinking
he
did
me
the
honour
of
desiring
to
find
me
or
any
other
do
not
depreciate
the
potency
of
your
charms
mademoiselle
who
having
seen
you
once
could
help
hoping
to
see
you
again
my
friend
said
liane
with
a
pursed
judgmatical
mouth
i
think
you
are
much
too
amiable
but
i
assure
you
never
a
day
has
passed
no
nor
yet
a
night
that
i
have
not
dwelt
upon
the
thought
of
you
since
you
made
so
effective
an
entrance
to
the
château
a
vision
of
radiant
beauty
out
of
that
night
of
tempest
and
fury
liane
drooped
a
coy
head
monsieur
compliments
me
too
much
impossible
is
one
then
to
understand
that
monsieur
is
making
love
to
me
lanyard
pronounced
coolly
no
that
won
another
laugh
of
personal
appreciation
what
then
mon
ami
figure
to
yourself
that
one
may
often
dream
of
the
unattainable
without
aspiring
to
possess
it
unattainable
liane
repeated
in
a
liquid
voice
what
a
dismal
word
monsieur
it
means
what
it
means
mademoiselle
to
the
contrary
monsieur
it
means
what
you
wish
it
to
mean
you
should
revise
your
lexicon
now
it
is
mademoiselle
who
is
too
flattering
and
where
is
that
good
monsieur
monk
the
woman
overlooked
the
innuendo
or
rather
buried
it
under
a
landslide
of
emotional
acting
ah
monsieur
but
i
am
desolated
inconsolable
he
has
gone
away
monsieur
monk
lanyard
opened
his
eyes
wide
who
else
he
has
left
france
he
has
returned
to
his
barbarous
america
with
his
beautiful
motor
car
his
kind
heart
and
all
his
millions
and
the
excellent
phinuit
that
one
as
well
how
long
ago
a
week
they
did
sail
from
cherbourg
it
is
a
week
since
anyone
has
heard
me
laugh
lanyard
compassionately
fished
a
bottle
out
of
the
cooler
and
refilled
her
glass
accept
mademoiselle
every
assurance
of
my
profound
sympathy
you
have
a
heart
my
friend
she
said
and
drank
with
the
feverish
passion
of
the
disconsolate
and
one
very
truly
at
mademoiselle
service
liane
sniffed
mournfully
and
dabbed
at
her
nose
with
a
ridiculous
travesty
of
a
handkerchief
be
so
kind
she
said
in
a
tearful
voice
though
her
eyes
were
quite
dry
and
if
one
looked
closely
calculating
a
cigarette
one
inferred
that
the
storm
was
over
lanyard
tendered
his
cigarette
case
and
then
a
match
wondering
what
next
what
he
had
reason
to
anticipate
was
sure
to
come
the
only
question
was
when
not
that
it
mattered
when
he
was
ready
for
it
at
any
time
and
there
was
no
hurry
athenais
finding
herself
paired
with
an
good
dancer
in
le
brun
was
considerately
making
good
use
of
this
pretext
for
remaining
on
the
floor
there
were
two
bands
to
furnish
practically
continuous
music
and
leave
lanyard
to
finish
uninterrupted
what
she
perfectly
understood
to
be
a
conversation
of
considerable
moment
as
for
benouville
he
was
much
too
well
trained
to
dream
of
returning
without
being
bidden
by
liane
delorme
but
it
is
wonderful
murmured
that
one
pensive
and
there
was
that
in
her
tone
to
make
lanyard
mentally
prick
forward
his
ears
he
sketched
a
point
of
interrogation
to
encounter
so
much
understanding
in
one
who
is
a
complete
stranger
lanyard
considered
i
think
it
coming
monsieur
must
not
think
me
unappreciative
ah
mademoiselle
he
protested
sadly
but
you
forget
so
easily
that
we
have
met
before
when
i
term
you
a
complete
stranger
well
yes
it
is
because
i
would
not
be
in
monsieur
debt
pardon
i
will
repay
sympathy
with
sympathy
i
have
already
forgotten
that
i
ever
visited
the
château
de
montalais
so
how
should
i
remember
i
met
monsieur
there
under
the
name
of
but
i
forget
the
name
of
duchemin
i
never
knew
there
was
such
a
name
i
swear
before
i
saw
it
in
type
in
type
monsieur
does
not
read
the
papers
not
all
of
them
mademoiselle
it
appeared
in
le
matin
this
quaint
name
duchemin
in
a
despatch
from
millau
stating
that
a
person
of
that
name
a
guest
of
the
château
de
montalais
had
disappeared
without
taking
formal
leave
of
his
hosts
one
gathers
that
he
took
something
else
nothing
less
than
the
anstruther
collection
of
jewels
the
property
of
madame
de
montalais
née
anstruther
but
i
am
recently
from
the
château
de
montalais
and
in
a
position
to
assure
mademoiselle
that
this
poor
fellow
duchemin
is
unjustly
accused
oh
ho
ho
he
heard
again
that
laugh
of
broad
derision
which
had
seemed
so
out
of
character
with
a
great
lady
when
he
had
heard
it
first
that
night
now
nearly
a
month
old
mademoiselle
does
not
believe
i
think
monsieur
must
be
a
good
friend
to
this
monsieur
duchemin
i
confess
i
entertain
a
sneaking
fondness
for
his
memory
you
can
hardly
call
yourself
an
impartial
judge
it
is
nevertheless
true
he
did
not
steal
the
jewels
then
tell
me
who
did
take
them
unfortunately
for
duchemin
that
remains
a
mystery
rather
i
should
say
fortunately
for
him
you
would
wrong
him
then
but
why
if
innocent
did
he
run
away
i
imagine
because
he
knew
he
would
surely
be
accused
in
which
case
ancient
history
would
be
revived
to
prove
him
guilty
beyond
a
question
in
the
mind
of
any
sane
court
does
one
understand
he
had
a
history
i
have
heard
it
intimated
such
was
the
case
but
i
remain
in
the
dark
the
theft
presumably
was
not
discovered
till
after
his
disappearance
yet
according
to
your
contention
he
must
have
known
of
it
in
advance
how
do
you
account
for
that
mademoiselle
would
make
a
famous
juge
that
does
not
answer
my
argument
how
is
one
to
answer
it
who
knows
how
duchemin
discovered
the
theft
before
the
ladies
of
the
château
did
do
you
know
what
you
make
me
think
that
he
was
not
as
innocent
as
you
assert
mademoiselle
will
explain
i
have
a
suspicion
that
this
monsieur
duchemin
was
guilty
in
intention
but
when
it
came
to
put
his
intention
into
execution
he
found
he
had
been
anticipated
mademoiselle
is
too
clever
for
me
now
i
should
never
have
thought
of
that
he
would
have
been
wiser
to
stay
and
fight
it
out
the
very
fact
of
his
flight
confesses
his
guilt
perhaps
he
did
not
remember
that
until
too
late
and
now
nothing
can
clear
him
how
sad
for
him
a
chance
meeting
with
one
who
is
not
his
friend
a
whispered
word
to
the
préfecture
or
the
nearest
agent
de
police
and
within
an
hour
he
finds
himself
in
the
santé
poor
chap
said
lanyard
with
a
doleful
shake
of
the
head
i
too
pity
him
the
woman
declared
monsieur
against
my
prejudice
your
faith
in
duchemin
has
persuaded
me
i
am
convinced
that
he
is
innocent
how
good
you
are
it
makes
me
glad
i
have
so
well
forgotten
ever
meeting
him
i
do
not
believe
i
should
know
him
if
i
found
him
here
in
this
very
restaurant
even
seated
by
my
side
it
is
mademoiselle
now
whose
heart
is
great
and
kind
you
may
believe
it
well
and
does
mademoiselle
forgetfulness
perhaps
extend
even
farther
into
the
so
dead
past
but
monsieur
i
was
a
mere
child
when
i
first
came
to
paris
before
the
war
how
could
anyone
reasonably
expect
my
memory
of
those
innocent
girlish
days
to
be
exact
regard
that
even
then
i
met
people
by
hundreds
as
a
young
girl
studying
for
the
stage
must
is
it
likely
one
face
would
stand
out
in
my
memory
more
than
another
quite
if
you
ask
me
said
lanyard
dryly
quite
likely
if
any
circumstance
connected
with
that
face
were
at
all
memorable
but
i
assure
you
i
was
in
those
days
much
too
to
pay
much
attention
to
others
it
is
that
way
you
know
in
maiden
days
mademoiselle
does
injustice
to
her
memory
lanyard
insisted
in
polite
astonishment
in
some
ways
it
is
wonderful
the
woman
looked
suddenly
aside
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
face
but
he
perceived
with
an
astonishment
which
he
made
no
attempt
to
hide
that
she
was
quaking
bodily
with
some
unconfessed
emotion
and
when
she
faced
again
his
unbroken
look
of
grave
bewilderment
he
discovered
that
she
was
really
capable
of
tears
monsieur
she
gasped
believe
it
or
not
never
before
have
i
met
one
with
whom
i
was
so
completely
en
rapport
and
instantaneously
it
is
priceless
this
we
must
see
more
of
one
another
much
more
lanyard
assented
gravely
a
great
deal
more
she
supplemented
with
significance
i
am
sure
we
shall
get
along
together
famously
mademoiselle
offers
me
great
honour
nothing
less
than
my
friendship
i
would
be
indeed
an
ingrate
to
refuse
it
but
a
question
will
not
people
talk
what
amusement
shook
her
again
how
talk
what
more
can
they
say
about
liane
delorme
ah
said
lanyard
but
about
madame
la
comtesse
de
lorgnes
my
friend
that
was
a
good
joke
once
but
now
you
must
forget
that
name
as
utterly
as
i
have
forgotten
another
impossible
what
do
you
say
she
frowned
a
little
is
it
possible
you
misunderstood
de
lorgnes
was
nothing
to
me
i
never
thought
he
was
you
had
reason
because
we
were
thrown
together
and
our
names
were
something
alike
in
sound
it
amused
us
not
the
two
of
us
alone
but
all
our
party
to
pretend
i
was
madame
la
comtesse
he
was
really
a
count
who
knows
it
was
the
style
by
which
he
had
always
passed
with
us
alas
sighed
lanyard
and
bent
a
sombre
gaze
upon
his
glass
without
looking
he
was
aware
of
a
questioning
gesture
of
the
head
he
said
no
more
but
shook
his
own
what
is
this
she
asked
sharply
you
know
something
about
de
lorgnes
had
you
not
heard
he
countered
looking
up
in
surprise
heard
he
saw
her
eyes
stabbed
by
fear
and
knew
himself
justified
of
his
surmises
all
day
she
had
been
expecting
de
lorgnes
or
word
from
him
all
day
and
all
this
night
one
could
imagine
the
hourly
augmented
strain
of
care
and
foreboding
indeed
its
evidence
were
only
too
clearly
betrayed
in
her
face
and
manner
of
that
moment
she
was
on
the
rack
but
there
was
no
pity
in
lanyard
heart
he
knew
her
of
old
what
she
was
what
evil
she
had
done
and
in
his
hearing
still
sounded
the
echoes
of
those
words
with
which
obliquely
enough
but
without
misunderstanding
on
the
part
of
either
she
had
threatened
to
expose
him
to
the
police
unless
he
consented
to
some
sort
of
an
alliance
with
her
a
collaboration
whose
nature
could
not
but
be
dishonourable
if
it
were
nothing
more
than
a
simple
conspiracy
of
mutual
silence
and
purposely
he
delayed
his
answer
till
her
patience
gave
way
and
she
was
clutching
his
arm
with
frantic
hands
what
is
the
matter
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
why
do
you
tell
me
if
there
is
anything
to
tell
i
was
hesitating
to
shock
you
liane
never
mind
me
what
has
happened
to
de
lorgnes
it
is
in
all
the
evening
newspapers
the
murder
mystery
of
the
lyons
rapide
de
lorgnes
lanyard
inclined
his
head
the
woman
breathed
an
invocation
to
the
deity
and
sank
back
against
the
wall
her
face
ghastly
beneath
its
paint
you
know
this
i
was
a
passenger
aboard
the
rapide
and
saw
the
body
before
it
was
removed
liane
delorme
made
an
effort
to
speak
but
only
her
breath
rustled
harshly
on
her
dry
lips
she
swallowed
convulsively
turned
to
her
glass
and
found
it
empty
lanyard
hastened
to
refill
it
she
took
the
wine
at
a
gulp
muttered
a
word
of
thanks
and
offered
the
glass
to
be
filled
anew
but
when
this
had
been
done
sat
unconscious
of
it
staring
witlessly
at
nothing
so
lost
to
her
surroundings
that
all
the
muscles
of
her
face
relaxed
and
her
years
peered
out
through
that
mask
of
artifice
which
alone
preserved
for
her
the
illusion
and
repute
of
beauty
thus
the
face
of
an
evil
woman
of
debauched
beyond
hope
of
redemption
was
hideously
revealed
lanyard
knew
a
qualm
at
seeing
it
and
looked
hastily
away
beyond
the
rank
of
tables
which
stood
between
him
and
the
dancing
floor
he
saw
athenais
reneaux
with
le
brun
sweeping
past
in
the
suave
movement
of
a
waltz
the
girl
face
wore
a
startled
expression
her
gaze
was
direct
to
the
woman
at
lanyard
side
then
it
shifted
enquiringly
to
him
with
a
look
lanyard
warned
her
to
compose
herself
then
lifted
an
eyebrow
and
glanced
meaningly
toward
the
doors
the
least
of
nods
answered
him
before
le
brun
swung
athenais
toward
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
other
couples
intervened
liane
delorme
stirred
abruptly
the
assassin
she
demanded
is
there
any
clue
i
believe
he
is
known
by
description
but
missing
but
you
my
friend
what
do
you
know
as
much
as
anybody
i
fancy
except
the
author
of
the
murder
tell
me
quietly
briefly
lanyard
told
her
of
seeing
the
comte
de
lorgnes
at
dinner
in
lyons
of
the
uneasiness
he
manifested
and
the
cumulative
feeling
of
frustration
and
failure
he
so
plainly
betrayed
as
the
last
hours
of
his
life
wore
on
of
the
apaches
who
watched
de
lorgnes
in
the
café
and
the
fact
that
one
of
them
had
contrived
to
secure
a
berth
in
the
same
carriage
with
his
victim
of
seeing
the
presumptive
murderer
slinking
away
from
the
train
at
laroche
and
of
the
discovery
of
the
body
on
the
arrival
of
the
rapide
at
the
gare
de
lyon
absorbed
with
eyes
abstracted
and
intent
and
a
mouth
whose
essential
selfishness
and
cruelty
was
unconsciously
stressed
by
the
compression
of
her
lips
the
woman
heard
him
as
he
might
have
been
a
disembodied
voice
now
and
again
however
she
nodded
intently
and
when
he
finished
had
a
pertinent
question
ready
you
say
a
description
of
this
assassin
exists
have
i
not
communicated
it
to
you
but
to
the
police
is
it
likely
the
woman
gave
him
a
blank
stare
pardon
mademoiselle
but
is
it
likely
that
the
late
andré
duchemin
would
have
more
to
do
with
the
police
than
he
could
avoid
you
would
see
a
crime
go
unavenged
rather
than
dedicate
the
remainder
of
my
days
to
seeing
the
world
through
prison
bars
i
should
say
yes
seeing
that
this
assassination
does
not
concern
me
and
i
am
guiltless
of
the
crime
with
which
i
myself
am
charged
but
you
who
were
a
friend
to
de
lorgnes
know
the
facts
and
nothing
hinders
your
communicating
them
to
the
préfecture
though
i
will
confess
it
would
be
gracious
of
you
to
keep
my
name
out
of
the
affair
but
lanyard
was
not
dicing
with
chance
when
he
made
this
suggestion
he
knew
very
well
liane
delorme
would
not
go
to
the
police
that
for
the
préfecture
she
clicked
a
against
her
teeth
what
does
it
know
what
does
it
do
when
it
knows
anything
i
agree
with
mademoiselle
entirely
ah
she
mused
bitterly
if
only
we
knew
the
name
of
that
sale
cochon
we
do
we
monsieur
i
at
least
know
one
of
the
many
names
doubtless
employed
by
the
assassin
and
you
hesitate
to
tell
me
why
should
i
no
but
an
effort
of
memory
lanyard
measured
a
silence
seeming
lost
in
thought
in
reality
timing
the
blow
and
preparing
to
note
its
effect
then
snapping
his
fingers
as
one
who
says
i
have
it
albert
dupont
he
announced
abruptly
unquestionably
the
name
meant
nothing
to
the
woman
she
curled
a
lip
but
that
is
any
name
then
thoughtfully
you
heard
his
companion
of
the
café
call
him
that
no
mademoiselle
but
i
recognised
the
animal
as
albert
dupont
when
he
boarded
the
train
at
that
morning
and
unnoticed
by
him
travelled
with
him
all
the
way
to
lyons
you
recognised
him
i
believe
it
well
when
had
you
known
him
first
when
i
fought
with
him
at
later
when
he
sought
to
do
me
in
on
the
outskirts
of
nant
he
was
the
fugitive
chauffeur
of
the
château
de
montalais
but
name
of
a
sacred
name
what
had
that
one
to
do
with
de
lorgnes
if
you
will
tell
me
that
there
will
be
no
more
mystery
in
this
sad
affair
the
woman
brooded
heavily
for
a
moment
but
if
it
had
been
you
he
was
after
i
might
understand
he
caught
the
sidelong
glimmer
of
her
eye
upon
him
dark
with
an
unuttered
question
but
the
waltz
was
at
an
end
athenais
and
le
brun
were
threading
their
way
through
the
intervening
tables
the
interruption
could
not
have
been
better
timed
lanyard
was
keen
to
get
away
he
had
learned
all
that
he
could
reasonably
have
hoped
to
learn
from
liane
delorme
in
one
night
he
knew
that
she
and
de
lorgnes
had
been
mutually
interested
in
the
business
that
took
the
latter
to
lyons
he
had
the
testimony
of
his
own
perceptions
to
prove
that
news
of
the
murder
had
come
as
a
great
shock
to
her
on
that
same
testimony
he
was
prepared
to
swear
that
whatever
the
part
if
any
she
had
played
in
the
robbery
she
knew
nothing
of
albert
dupont
at
least
by
that
name
and
nothing
of
his
activities
as
chauffeur
at
the
château
de
montalais
yet
one
thing
more
lanyard
knew
that
liane
suspected
him
of
knowing
more
than
he
had
told
her
but
he
was
sorry
she
should
think
that
it
gave
him
a
continuing
claim
upon
her
interest
henceforth
she
might
be
wary
of
him
but
she
would
never
lose
touch
with
him
if
she
could
help
it
now
athenais
was
pausing
beside
the
table
and
saying
with
a
smile
as
weary
as
it
was
charming
come
monsieur
paul
if
you
please
and
take
me
home
i
danced
till
i
ready
to
drop
annoyed
by
the
prospect
of
being
obliged
to
let
lanyard
out
of
her
sight
so
soon
before
she
had
time
to
mature
her
plans
with
respect
to
him
liane
delorme
pulled
herself
together
go
home
she
protested
with
a
vivacity
so
forced
it
drew
a
curious
stare
even
from
the
empty
le
brun
so
early
my
dear
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
been
on
the
go
all
day
long
athenais
explained
sweetly
and
now
i
got
nothing
left
to
keep
up
on
zut
the
delorme
insisted
have
more
champagne
and
thank
you
no
dearest
my
head
is
swimming
with
it
already
i
really
must
go
surely
you
do
mind
but
liane
did
mind
and
the
wine
she
had
drunk
had
left
her
only
a
remnant
of
sobriety
not
enough
for
good
control
of
her
temper
mind
she
echoed
rudely
why
should
i
mind
whether
you
stay
or
go
it
your
affair
not
mine
she
made
a
scornful
mouth
and
the
look
with
which
she
coupled
lanyard
and
athenais
in
innuendo
was
in
itself
almost
actionable
but
me
she
pursued
with
shrill
vivacity
i
sha
go
yet
i
not
drunk
enough
by
half
get
more
champagne
fred
this
to
le
brun
as
she
turned
a
gleaming
shoulder
to
the
others
quantities
of
it
and
tell
to
bring
angele
over
and
constance
and
victor
too
thanks
to
the
good
god
they
at
least
know
they
are
still
alive
xv
adieu
ever
since
the
fall
of
evening
whose
clear
gloaming
had
seemed
to
promise
a
fair
night
of
moonlight
the
skies
had
been
thickening
slowly
over
paris
while
still
at
the
ambassadeurs
lanyard
had
noticed
that
the
moon
was
being
blotted
out
by
midnight
its
paling
disk
had
become
totally
eclipsed
the
clouds
hung
low
over
the
city
a
dense
blanket
imprisoning
heat
which
was
oppressive
even
in
the
open
and
stifling
in
the
restaurants
now
from
the
shelter
of
the
café
canopy
lanyard
and
athenais
reneaux
looked
out
upon
a
pave
like
a
river
of
jet
ribboned
with
gently
glowing
lights
and
running
between
the
low
banks
of
sidewalks
no
less
black
both
deserted
but
for
a
few
belated
prowlers
lurching
homeward
through
the
drizzle
and
a
rank
of
private
cars
waiting
near
the
entrance
the
bedizened
porter
whistled
fatuously
at
a
passing
taxicab
which
though
fareless
held
steadfast
to
its
way
while
the
driver
acknowledged
the
signal
only
with
jeers
and
disgraceful
gestures
after
the
manner
of
his
kind
so
that
lanyard
remembering
how
frequently
similar
experiences
had
befallen
him
in
paris
reflected
sadly
that
the
great
conflict
had
after
all
worked
little
change
in
human
hearts
charitably
assuming
the
bosoms
of
french
to
be
so
furnished
presently
however
the
persistent
whistle
conjured
from
round
a
corner
a
rakish
hansom
that
like
the
creature
between
its
shafts
and
the
driver
on
its
lofty
box
with
his
face
in
full
bloom
and
his
bleary
eyes
his
and
high
hat
of
oilcloth
had
doubtless
been
brisk
with
young
ambition
in
the
golden
time
of
the
but
unmistakably
of
the
vintage
of
the
was
the
avarice
of
the
driver
for
when
he
had
been
given
the
address
of
the
athenais
apartment
he
announced
with
vinous
truculence
that
his
whim
inclined
to
precisely
the
opposite
direction
gathered
up
the
reins
clucked
in
peremptory
fashion
to
the
nag
which
sagely
paid
no
attention
to
him
whatsoever
and
consented
only
to
change
his
mind
when
promised
a
fabulous
fare
even
then
he
grumbled
profanely
while
lanyard
helped
athenais
to
climb
in
and
took
the
place
by
her
side
the
rue
pigalle
was
as
dark
and
still
as
any
street
in
a
deserted
village
from
its
gloomy
walls
the
halting
clatter
of
hoofs
struck
empty
echoes
that
rang
in
lanyard
heart
like
a
refrain
from
some
old
song
to
that
very
tune
had
the
gay
world
gone
about
its
affaires
in
younger
years
when
the
lone
wolf
was
a
living
fact
and
not
a
fading
memory
in
the
minds
of
men
he
sighed
heavily
monsieur
is
sentimental
commented
athenais
reneaux
lightly
beware
sentimentalists
come
always
to
some
sad
end
one
has
found
that
true
but
you
are
young
to
know
it
athenais
a
woman
is
never
young
after
a
certain
age
save
when
she
loves
my
friend
that
too
is
true
but
still
you
are
overyoung
to
have
learned
it
one
learns
life
lessons
not
in
any
fixed
and
predetermined
order
paul
with
no
sort
of
sequence
whatever
but
as
and
when
life
chooses
to
teach
them
quel
dommage
lanyard
murmured
and
subsided
into
another
silence
the
girl
grew
restive
but
tell
me
my
dear
don
juan
she
protested
do
all
your
conquests
affect
you
in
this
morbid
fashion
conquests
you
seemed
to
get
on
very
well
with
liane
delorme
pardon
if
i
am
sentimental
it
is
because
old
memories
have
been
awakened
memories
of
forfeit
days
when
one
thought
well
of
oneself
here
in
paris
days
in
which
no
doubt
liane
played
a
part
a
very
minor
rôle
athenais
but
are
you
doing
me
the
honour
to
be
jealous
perhaps
petit
monsieur
paul
in
the
broken
light
of
passing
lamps
her
quiet
smile
was
as
illegible
as
her
shadowed
eyes
after
a
moment
lanyard
laughed
a
little
caught
up
her
hand
patted
it
indulgently
and
with
gentle
decision
replaced
it
in
her
lap
it
is
fair
my
dear
to
be
putting
foolish
notions
into
elderly
heads
merely
because
you
know
you
can
do
it
show
a
little
respect
for
my
grey
hairs
of
which
there
are
far
too
many
they
most
becoming
said
athenais
reneaux
demurely
but
tell
me
about
liane
if
it
is
a
secret
oh
that
was
so
long
ago
and
such
a
trifling
thing
one
wonders
at
remembering
it
at
all
i
happened
one
night
to
be
where
i
had
no
right
to
be
that
was
rather
a
habit
of
mine
i
afraid
and
so
i
discovered
in
another
man
apartment
a
young
woman
hardly
more
than
a
child
trying
to
commit
suicide
you
may
believe
i
put
a
stop
to
that
later
for
in
those
days
i
had
some
little
influence
in
certain
quarters
i
got
her
place
in
the
chorus
at
the
variétés
she
made
up
a
name
for
the
stage
liane
delorme
and
that
is
all
you
see
it
was
very
simple
and
she
was
grateful
not
oppressively
she
was
quite
normal
about
it
all
still
she
has
not
forgotten
but
remind
yourself
that
the
chemistry
of
years
is
such
that
inevitably
a
sense
of
obligation
in
due
course
turns
into
a
grudge
it
is
true
liane
has
not
forgotten
but
i
am
by
no
means
sure
she
has
forgiven
me
for
saving
her
to
life
there
may
be
something
in
that
seeing
what
she
has
made
of
her
life
now
there
is
where
you
can
instruct
me
i
have
been
long
in
exile
but
you
know
how
liane
graduated
from
the
chorus
of
the
variétés
became
first
a
principal
there
then
the
rage
of
all
the
music
halls
with
her
way
of
singing
rhymed
indecencies
one
has
heard
something
of
that
on
the
peak
of
her
success
she
retired
saying
she
had
worked
long
enough
made
enough
money
that
too
knows
itself
but
liane
retired
only
from
the
stage
you
understand
perfectly
she
continued
to
make
many
dear
friends
some
of
them
among
the
greatest
personages
of
europe
so
that
gradually
she
became
what
she
is
athenais
reneaux
pronounced
soberly
as
i
think
the
most
dangerous
woman
on
the
continent
how
covetous
grasping
utterly
unscrupulous
and
corrupt
and
weirdly
powerful
she
has
a
strange
influence
in
the
highest
places
blackmail
god
knows
it
was
at
all
events
strong
enough
to
save
her
from
being
shot
during
the
war
i
was
assigned
to
watch
her
then
there
was
a
suspicion
in
england
that
she
was
in
communication
with
the
enemy
i
found
it
to
be
quite
true
she
knew
bolo
pasha
intimately
caillaux
too
other
women
many
of
them
fled
the
country
or
went
to
lazare
for
the
duration
of
the
war
or
faced
firing
squads
at
dawn
for
doing
infinitely
less
than
she
did
to
betray
france
and
her
allies
but
liane
delorme
got
off
i
happen
to
know
that
england
made
the
strongest
representations
to
the
french
government
about
her
i
know
personally
of
two
young
french
officers
who
had
been
on
friendly
terms
with
liane
and
who
shot
themselves
one
dramatically
on
her
very
doorstep
and
why
did
they
do
that
if
not
in
remorse
for
betraying
to
her
secrets
which
afterwards
somehow
found
their
way
to
the
enemy
but
nothing
was
ever
done
about
it
she
was
never
in
the
least
molested
and
nightly
you
might
see
her
at
maxim
or
making
love
to
officers
while
at
the
front
men
were
being
slaughtered
by
the
hundreds
thanks
to
her
treachery
ah
monsieur
i
tell
you
i
know
that
woman
too
well
the
girl
voice
quavered
with
indignation
so
that
was
how
you
came
to
know
her
lanyard
commented
as
if
he
had
found
nothing
else
of
interest
i
wondered
yes
we
were
bosom
friends
almost
for
a
time
it
was
nice
but
the
job
had
to
be
done
then
liane
grew
suspicious
and
our
friendship
cooled
one
night
i
had
a
narrow
escape
from
some
apaches
i
recognised
liane
hand
in
that
she
was
afraid
i
knew
something
so
i
did
but
she
did
dream
how
much
i
knew
if
she
had
there
would
have
been
a
second
attempt
of
that
sort
minus
the
escape
then
the
armistice
came
to
cool
our
passions
and
liane
found
other
things
to
think
about
god
knows
what
other
mischief
to
do
in
time
of
peace
i
think
lanyard
suggested
recalling
that
conversation
in
the
grand
salon
of
the
château
de
montalais
you
had
better
look
to
yourself
athenais
as
far
as
liane
is
concerned
after
she
only
needed
to
see
you
with
me
to
have
confirmed
any
suspicions
she
may
previously
have
had
concerning
your
relations
with
the
i
will
remember
that
the
girl
said
calmly
many
thanks
dear
friend
but
what
is
it
you
are
doing
all
the
time
what
is
it
you
see
as
the
hansom
swung
round
the
dark
pile
of
the
trinité
lanyard
had
for
the
third
time
twisted
round
in
his
seat
to
peep
back
up
the
rue
pigalle
through
the
little
window
in
the
rear
as
i
thought
he
let
the
leather
flap
fall
over
the
and
sat
back
liane
does
trust
me
he
sighed
disconsolate
we
are
followed
by
a
of
some
sort
creeping
along
without
lights
probably
one
of
the
private
cars
that
were
waiting
when
we
came
out
i
have
a
pistol
if
you
need
one
athenais
offered
then
you
were
more
sensible
than
i
lanyard
held
a
thoughtful
silence
for
some
minutes
while
the
cab
jogged
sedately
down
the
rue
lazare
then
had
another
look
back
through
the
little
window
no
mistake
about
that
he
reported
and
bending
forward
began
to
peer
intently
right
and
left
into
the
dark
throats
of
several
minor
streets
they
passed
after
leaving
the
hôtel
terminus
behind
and
heading
down
the
rue
de
la
pépinière
the
deuce
of
it
is
he
complained
this
inhuman
loneliness
if
there
were
only
something
like
a
crowd
in
the
streets
as
there
must
have
been
earlier
in
the
evening
what
are
you
thinking
of
monsieur
but
naturally
of
ridding
you
of
an
embarrassing
and
perhaps
dangerous
companion
if
you
mean
you
planning
to
jump
down
and
run
for
it
athenais
replied
you
a
fool
you
not
get
far
with
a
motor
car
pursuing
you
and
sergents
de
ville
abnormally
on
the
qui
vive
because
the
crime
wave
that
followed
demobilisation
as
yet
shows
no
signs
of
subsiding
but
mademoiselle
it
makes
me
so
unhappy
to
have
any
shadow
but
my
own
then
rest
tranquil
here
with
me
it
is
much
farther
to
my
apartment
possibly
it
would
be
better
to
drop
you
there
first
nothing
of
the
sort
but
positively
the
contrary
my
dear
child
if
i
were
to
do
as
you
wish
they
would
think
my
dear
paul
i
do
give
a
damn
what
they
think
remember
i
am
specially
charged
with
the
preservation
of
your
life
while
in
paris
besides
my
apartment
is
the
most
discreet
little
one
could
wish
there
is
more
than
one
way
in
and
out
and
once
they
think
you
are
placed
for
the
night
it
more
than
likely
they
wo
even
set
a
watch
but
will
trot
off
to
report
then
you
can
slip
away
when
you
will
he
stared
knowing
a
moment
of
doubt
to
which
a
hard
little
laugh
put
a
period
oh
you
need
be
so
thoughtful
of
my
reputation
if
this
were
the
worst
that
could
be
said
of
me
lanyard
laughed
in
turn
quietly
tolerant
and
squeezed
her
hand
again
you
are
a
dear
he
said
but
you
need
to
be
a
far
better
actress
to
deceive
me
about
such
matters
do
be
stupid
her
sulky
voice
retorted
i
not
he
bent
forward
again
folding
his
arms
on
the
ledge
of
the
apron
studying
the
streets
and
consulting
an
astonishingly
accurate
mental
map
of
paris
which
more
than
once
had
stood
him
in
good
stead
in
other
times
after
a
little
the
girl
hand
crept
along
his
arm
took
possession
of
his
hand
and
used
it
as
a
lever
to
swing
him
back
to
face
her
in
the
stronger
lighting
of
the
boulevard
haussmann
her
face
seemed
oddly
childlike
oddly
luminous
with
appeal
please
petit
monsieur
paul
i
ask
it
of
you
i
wish
it
to
please
me
o
lord
lanyard
sighed
how
is
one
to
resist
when
you
plead
so
prettily
to
be
compromised
since
that
settled
of
a
sudden
the
imploring
child
was
replaced
by
mademoiselle
athenais
reneaux
you
may
have
your
hand
back
again
i
assure
you
i
have
no
more
use
for
it
the
hansom
turned
off
the
boulevard
affording
lanyard
an
opportunity
to
look
back
through
the
side
window
still
on
the
trail
he
announced
but
they
got
the
lights
on
now
with
a
profound
sigh
from
the
heart
the
horse
stopped
in
front
of
a
corner
apartment
building
and
later
with
a
groan
almost
human
responded
to
the
whip
and
jingled
the
hansom
away
leaving
lanyard
the
poorer
by
the
exorbitant
fare
he
had
promised
and
something
more
athenais
was
already
at
the
main
entrance
ringing
for
the
concierge
lanyard
hastened
to
join
her
but
before
he
could
cross
the
sidewalk
a
poked
its
nose
round
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
haussmann
a
short
block
away
and
bore
swiftly
their
way
seeming
to
search
the
street
suspiciously
with
its
blank
lidless
eyes
of
glare
peste
breathed
the
girl
i
have
a
private
entrance
and
my
own
key
we
could
have
used
that
had
i
imagined
this
sacred
pig
of
a
concierge
the
latch
clicked
she
thrust
the
door
open
and
slipped
into
dense
darkness
lanyard
lingered
another
instant
the
car
was
slowing
down
and
the
street
lamp
on
the
corner
revealed
plainly
a
masculine
arm
resting
on
its
but
the
spying
face
above
the
arm
was
only
a
blur
come
monsieur
lanyard
stepped
in
and
shut
the
door
a
hand
with
which
he
was
beginning
to
feel
fairly
well
acquainted
found
his
and
led
him
through
the
dead
obscurity
to
another
pause
a
key
grated
in
a
lock
the
hand
drew
him
on
again
a
second
door
closed
behind
him
we
are
chez
moi
said
a
voice
in
the
dark
one
could
do
with
a
light
wait
this
way
the
hand
guided
him
across
a
room
of
moderate
size
avoiding
its
furniture
with
almost
uncanny
ease
then
again
brought
him
to
a
halt
brass
rings
clashed
softly
on
a
pole
a
gap
opened
in
heavy
draperies
curtaining
a
window
a
shaft
of
street
light
threw
the
girl
profile
into
soft
relief
she
drew
him
to
her
till
their
shoulders
touched
you
see
he
bent
his
head
close
to
hers
conscious
of
a
caressing
tendril
of
hair
that
touched
his
cheek
and
the
sweet
warmth
and
fragrance
of
her
and
peering
through
the
draperies
saw
their
pursuing
motor
car
at
pause
not
at
the
curb
but
in
the
middle
of
the
street
before
the
house
the
man
arm
still
rested
on
the
sill
of
the
window
the
pale
oval
of
the
face
above
it
was
still
vague
abruptly
both
disappeared
a
door
slammed
on
the
far
side
of
the
car
and
the
car
itself
after
a
moment
wait
gathered
way
with
whining
gears
and
vanished
leaving
nothing
human
visible
in
the
quiet
street
what
did
that
mean
did
they
pick
somebody
up
but
quite
otherwise
mademoiselle
then
what
has
become
of
him
in
the
shadow
of
the
door
across
the
way
do
you
see
the
deeper
shadow
of
his
figure
in
the
corner
to
this
side
and
there
ah
dolt
the
man
in
the
doorway
had
moved
cautiously
thrusting
one
hand
out
of
the
shadow
far
enough
for
the
street
lights
to
shine
upon
the
dial
of
his
instantly
it
was
withdrawn
but
his
betrayal
was
accomplished
that
enough
said
lanyard
drawing
the
draperies
close
again
no
trouble
to
make
a
fool
of
that
one
god
has
so
nobly
prepared
the
soil
the
girl
said
nothing
they
no
longer
touched
and
she
was
for
the
time
so
still
that
he
might
almost
have
fancied
himself
alone
but
in
that
quiet
room
he
could
hear
her
breathing
close
beside
him
not
heavily
but
with
a
rapid
accent
hinting
at
an
agitation
which
her
voice
bore
out
when
she
answered
his
wondering
mademoiselle
suis
petit
monsieur
paul
is
anything
the
matter
no
no
there
is
nothing
the
matter
i
afraid
i
have
tired
you
out
i
do
not
deny
i
am
a
little
weary
forgive
me
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
not
yet
petit
monsieur
paul
a
trace
of
hard
humour
crept
into
her
tone
it
is
all
in
the
night
work
as
the
saying
should
be
in
paris
three
favours
more
then
i
will
do
you
one
in
return
ask
be
so
kind
as
to
make
a
light
and
find
me
a
pocket
if
you
have
one
i
can
do
the
latter
without
the
former
it
is
better
that
we
show
no
light
one
stray
gleam
through
the
curtains
would
tell
too
much
wait
a
noise
of
light
footsteps
muffled
by
a
rug
high
heels
tapping
on
uncovered
floor
the
scrape
of
a
drawer
pulled
out
and
she
returned
to
give
him
a
little
nickelled
electric
torch
and
then
liane
address
if
you
know
it
the
girl
named
a
number
on
an
avenue
not
far
distant
lanyard
remarked
this
yes
you
can
walk
there
in
less
than
five
minutes
and
finally
show
me
the
way
out
again
she
made
no
response
he
pursued
in
some
constraint
thus
you
will
enable
me
to
make
you
my
only
inadequate
return
leave
you
to
your
rest
yet
another
space
of
silence
then
a
gusty
little
laugh
that
is
a
great
favour
truly
petit
monsieur
paul
so
give
me
your
hand
once
more
but
she
no
longer
clung
to
it
as
before
the
clasp
of
her
fingers
was
light
cool
impersonal
to
the
point
of
indifference
vexed
resentful
of
her
resentment
lanyard
suffered
her
guidance
through
the
darkness
of
another
room
a
short
corridor
and
then
a
third
room
where
she
left
him
for
a
moment
he
heard
again
the
clash
of
curtain
rings
the
dim
violet
rectangle
of
a
window
appeared
in
the
darkness
the
figure
of
the
woman
in
vague
silhouette
against
it
a
sash
was
lifted
noiselessly
air
breathed
into
the
apartment
athenais
returned
to
his
side
pressed
into
his
palm
a
key
that
window
opens
on
a
court
the
drop
from
the
sill
is
no
more
than
four
feet
in
the
wall
immediately
opposite
you
will
find
a
door
this
key
opens
it
lock
the
door
behind
you
and
at
your
first
opportunity
throw
away
the
key
i
have
several
copies
you
will
find
yourself
in
a
corridor
leading
to
the
entrance
of
the
apartment
house
in
the
rear
of
this
facing
on
the
next
street
demand
the
cordon
of
the
concierge
as
if
you
were
a
late
guest
leaving
one
of
the
apartments
he
will
make
no
difficulty
about
opening
i
think
that
is
all
not
quite
there
remains
for
me
to
attempt
the
impossible
to
prove
my
gratitude
athenais
in
mere
unmeaning
words
do
try
paul
the
voice
was
softened
once
more
its
accents
broken
words
can
not
serve
us
you
and
me
there
is
one
way
only
and
that
i
know
is
rue
barré
her
sad
laugh
fluttered
she
crept
into
his
arms
but
still
petit
monsieur
paul
will
not
care
if
only
once
she
clung
to
him
for
a
long
long
moment
then
released
his
lips
men
have
kissed
me
yes
not
a
few
she
whispered
resting
her
face
on
his
bosom
but
you
alone
have
known
my
kiss
go
now
my
dear
while
i
have
strength
to
let
you
go
and
make
me
one
little
promise
whatever
you
ask
athenais
never
come
back
unless
you
need
me
for
i
shall
not
have
so
much
strength
another
time
alone
she
rested
a
burning
forehead
against
the
lifted
straining
her
vision
to
follow
his
shadow
as
it
moved
through
the
murk
of
the
court
below
and
lost
itself
in
the
deeper
gloom
of
the
opposing
wall
xvi
the
house
of
lilith
it
stood
and
massive
on
a
corner
between
the
avenues
de
friedland
et
des
near
their
junction
at
the
place
de
a
solid
stone
pile
of
a
in
the
most
modern
mode
without
architectural
beauty
boasting
little
attempt
at
exterior
embellishment
but
smelling
aloud
of
money
just
such
a
maison
de
ville
as
a
decent
bourgeois
banker
might
be
expected
to
build
him
when
he
contemplates
retiring
after
doing
the
rothschilds
a
wicked
one
in
the
eye
it
was
like
liane
impudence
too
lanyard
smiled
at
the
thought
as
he
studied
the
mansion
from
the
backwards
of
a
dark
doorway
in
the
diagonally
opposed
block
of
dwellings
her
kind
was
always
sure
to
seek
once
its
fortunes
were
on
firm
footing
to
establish
itself
as
here
in
the
very
heart
of
an
exclusive
residential
district
as
if
thinking
to
absorb
social
sanctity
through
the
simple
act
of
rubbing
shoulders
with
it
or
else
as
was
more
likely
to
be
the
case
with
a
woman
of
liane
delorme
temper
desiring
more
to
affront
a
world
from
which
she
was
outcast
than
to
lay
siege
to
its
favour
it
seemed
however
truly
deplorable
that
liane
should
have
proved
so
in
this
particular
respect
it
rendered
one
pet
project
much
too
difficult
of
execution
earnestly
as
one
desired
to
have
a
look
at
the
inside
of
that
house
without
the
knowledge
of
its
inmates
its
aspect
was
forbidding
and
discouraging
in
the
utmost
extreme
heavy
gates
of
wrought
bronze
guarded
the
front
doors
the
single
side
or
was
similarly
protected
if
more
simply
and
stout
grilles
of
bronze
barred
every
window
on
the
level
of
the
street
now
none
of
these
could
have
withstood
the
attack
of
a
man
of
ingenuity
with
a
little
time
at
his
disposal
but
lanyard
could
count
on
only
the
few
remaining
minutes
of
true
night
retarded
though
it
might
be
by
shrouded
skies
dawn
must
come
all
too
soon
for
his
comfort
yet
he
was
conscious
of
no
choice
in
the
matter
he
must
and
in
spite
of
everything
would
know
what
was
going
on
behind
that
blank
screen
of
stone
night
would
be
too
late
tonight
if
there
were
any
warrant
for
his
suspicions
the
jewels
of
eve
de
montalais
lay
in
the
dwelling
of
liane
delorme
or
if
they
were
not
there
the
secret
of
their
hiding
was
but
both
and
more
than
likely
liane
as
well
would
be
on
the
wing
or
lanyard
had
been
sorely
mistaken
in
seeing
in
her
as
badly
frightened
a
woman
as
he
had
ever
known
when
she
had
learned
of
the
assassination
of
de
lorgnes
it
was
possible
he
thought
it
extremely
probable
that
liane
delorme
was
as
powerful
as
athenais
reneaux
had
asserted
influential
that
is
with
the
state
with
the
dealers
in
its
laws
and
the
dispensers
of
its
protection
but
now
she
had
not
to
reckon
with
such
as
these
but
with
enemies
of
her
own
sort
with
an
antagonism
as
reckless
of
law
and
order
as
she
herself
and
she
was
afraid
of
that
infinitely
more
disturbed
in
mind
and
spirit
than
she
would
have
been
in
the
face
of
any
threat
on
the
part
of
the
police
the
préfecture
was
a
known
and
measured
force
an
engine
that
ran
as
it
were
on
mapped
lines
of
rail
its
moves
might
be
forecast
guarded
against
watched
evaded
but
this
other
force
worked
in
the
dark
this
hostile
power
personified
in
the
creature
who
had
called
himself
albert
dupont
the
very
composition
of
its
being
was
cloaked
in
a
secrecy
impenetrable
and
terrifying
its
intentions
and
its
workings
could
not
be
surmised
or
opposed
until
it
struck
and
the
success
or
failure
of
the
stroke
revealed
its
origin
and
aim
liane
or
one
misjudged
her
would
never
sit
still
and
wait
for
the
blow
to
fall
she
was
too
too
much
in
love
with
life
she
must
either
strike
first
in
and
in
such
case
strike
at
what
or
remove
beyond
the
range
of
the
enemy
malice
lanyard
was
confident
she
would
choose
the
latter
course
but
confidence
was
not
knowledge
he
transferred
his
attention
from
the
formidable
defences
of
the
lower
storey
to
the
second
here
all
the
windows
were
of
the
type
called
french
and
opened
inward
from
shallow
balconies
with
wrought
bronze
railings
lanyard
was
acquainted
with
every
form
of
fastening
used
for
such
windows
all
were
simple
none
could
resist
his
persuasions
provided
he
stood
upon
one
of
those
balconies
nor
did
he
count
it
a
difficult
matter
for
a
man
of
his
activity
and
strength
to
scale
the
front
of
the
house
as
far
as
the
second
storey
its
walls
were
builded
of
heavy
blocks
of
dressed
stone
with
deep
horizontal
channels
between
each
tier
these
grooves
would
be
greasy
with
rain
otherwise
one
could
hardly
ask
for
better
footholds
a
climb
of
some
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
to
the
balcony
one
should
be
able
to
make
that
within
two
minutes
granted
freedom
from
interruption
the
rub
was
there
the
quarter
seemed
quite
fast
asleep
in
the
five
minutes
which
had
elapsed
since
lanyard
had
ensconced
himself
in
the
doorway
no
motor
car
had
passed
not
a
footfall
had
disturbed
the
stillness
never
a
sound
of
any
sort
had
come
to
his
attention
other
than
one
distant
blare
of
a
automobile
horn
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
arc
de
triomphe
but
one
dared
not
count
on
long
continuance
of
such
conditions
already
the
sky
showed
a
lighter
shade
above
the
profile
of
the
roofs
and
one
wakeful
watcher
at
a
nearby
window
would
spell
ruin
nevertheless
he
must
adventure
the
consequences
poised
to
leave
his
shelter
and
dart
across
the
street
with
his
point
of
attack
already
selected
his
thoughts
already
busy
with
consideration
of
steps
to
follow
he
checked
and
fell
still
farther
back
into
the
shadow
something
was
happening
in
the
house
across
the
way
a
man
had
opened
the
and
paused
behind
the
bronze
gate
there
was
no
light
behind
him
and
the
gloom
and
intervening
strips
of
metal
rendered
his
figure
indistinct
lanyard
perceptions
had
none
the
less
been
instant
to
remark
that
slight
movement
and
the
accompanying
change
in
the
texture
of
the
darkness
barred
by
the
gate
following
a
little
wait
it
swung
slowly
out
perhaps
eighteen
inches
the
man
advancing
with
it
and
again
halting
to
peer
up
and
down
the
street
then
quickly
as
if
alarmed
he
withdrew
shut
the
gate
and
disappeared
closing
the
behind
him
listening
intently
lanyard
heard
no
click
of
latch
such
as
should
have
been
audible
in
that
dead
hour
of
hush
evidently
the
fellow
had
neglected
to
make
fast
the
gate
possibly
he
had
been
similarly
remiss
about
fastening
the
door
but
what
was
he
up
to
why
this
furtive
appearance
why
the
retreat
so
abruptly
executed
by
way
of
answer
came
the
soft
drone
of
a
motor
then
the
car
itself
rolled
into
view
a
stately
limousine
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
avenue
de
friedland
before
the
corner
house
it
stopped
a
lackey
alighted
with
an
umbrella
and
ran
to
hold
the
door
but
liane
delorme
would
not
wait
for
him
the
car
had
not
stopped
when
she
threw
the
door
open
on
the
instant
when
its
wheels
ceased
to
turn
she
jumped
down
and
ran
toward
the
house
heedless
of
the
rain
at
the
same
time
one
side
of
the
great
front
doors
swung
inward
and
a
footman
ran
out
to
open
the
gates
the
lackey
with
the
umbrella
though
he
moved
briskly
failed
to
catch
up
with
liane
before
she
sped
up
the
steps
so
he
closed
the
umbrella
and
trotted
back
to
his
place
beside
the
chauffeur
the
footman
shut
gates
and
door
as
the
limousine
moved
away
it
had
not
been
sixty
seconds
at
rest
in
fifteen
more
street
and
house
were
both
as
they
had
been
save
that
a
light
now
shone
through
the
plate
glass
of
the
latter
great
doors
and
that
was
soon
extinguished
conceiving
that
the
man
who
had
appeared
at
the
service
entrance
was
the
same
who
had
admitted
liane
lanyard
told
himself
he
understood
impatient
for
his
bed
the
fellow
had
gone
to
the
service
gate
to
spy
out
for
signs
of
madame
return
now
if
only
it
were
true
that
he
had
failed
to
close
it
securely
it
proved
so
the
gate
gave
readily
to
lanyard
pull
the
knob
of
the
small
door
turned
silently
he
stepped
across
the
threshold
and
shut
himself
into
an
unlighted
hall
thoughtfully
apeing
the
negligence
of
the
servant
and
leaving
the
door
barely
on
the
latch
by
way
of
provision
against
a
forced
retreat
so
far
good
he
felt
for
his
pocket
torch
then
sharply
fell
back
into
the
nearest
corner
and
made
himself
as
inconspicuous
as
might
be
footsteps
were
sounding
on
the
other
side
of
an
unseen
wall
he
waited
breathless
stirless
a
latch
rattled
and
at
about
three
yards
distance
a
narrow
door
opened
marked
by
a
widening
glow
of
light
a
liveried
footman
beyond
a
doubt
he
who
admitted
the
mistress
of
the
house
entered
carrying
an
electric
candle
yawned
with
a
superstitious
hand
before
his
mouth
and
looking
to
neither
right
nor
left
turned
away
from
lanyard
and
trudged
wearily
back
to
the
household
offices
at
the
far
end
of
the
long
hallway
a
door
closed
behind
him
and
lanyard
moved
swiftly
the
door
which
had
let
the
footman
into
the
hall
admitted
to
a
spacious
foyer
which
set
apart
the
entrance
and
as
the
play
of
the
electric
torch
disclosed
a
deep
and
richly
furnished
to
one
side
a
broad
flight
of
stairs
ascended
lanyard
went
up
with
the
activity
of
a
cat
making
no
more
noise
the
second
floor
proved
to
be
devoted
mainly
to
a
a
lounge
and
a
library
all
furnished
in
a
weird
inchoate
sort
of
magnificence
with
money
rather
than
with
taste
if
one
might
judge
fairly
by
the
fitful
and
guarded
beam
of
the
torch
the
taste
may
have
been
less
questionable
than
lanyard
thought
but
the
evidences
of
luxurious
tendencies
and
wealth
recklessly
wasted
in
their
gratification
were
irrefutable
lights
were
burning
on
the
floor
above
and
a
rumour
of
feminine
voices
drifted
down
interrupted
by
an
occasional
sibilant
rustle
of
silk
or
a
brief
patter
of
feet
noises
which
bore
out
the
conjecture
that
madame
maid
was
undressing
and
putting
her
to
bed
a
ceremony
apt
to
consume
a
considerable
time
with
a
woman
of
liane
age
and
disposition
passionately
bent
on
preserving
to
the
grave
a
semblance
of
freshness
in
her
charms
lanyard
reckoned
on
anything
from
fifteen
minutes
to
an
hour
before
her
couching
would
be
accomplished
and
the
maid
out
of
the
way
ten
minutes
more
and
liane
ought
to
be
asleep
if
it
turned
out
otherwise
well
one
would
have
to
deal
with
her
awake
no
need
to
be
gravely
concerned
about
that
to
envisage
the
contingency

to
be
prepared
against
it
believing
he
must
possess
his
soul
in
patience
for
an
indeterminable
wait
he
was
casting
about
for
a
place
to
secrete
himself
when
a
change
in
the
tenor
of
the
talk
between
mistress
and
maid
was
conveyed
by
a
sudden
lift
of
half
an
octave
in
the
latter
voice
sounding
a
sharp
note
of
protest
to
be
answered
by
liane
in
accent
of
overbearing
anger
one
simply
could
not
rest
without
knowing
what
that
meant
lanyard
mounted
the
second
flight
of
stairs
as
swiftly
surely
and
soundlessly
as
he
had
the
first
but
just
below
a
landing
where
the
staircase
had
an
angle
he
paused
crouching
low
flat
to
the
steps
his
head
lifted
just
enough
to
permit
him
to
see
above
the
edge
of
the
topmost
a
section
of
glowing
wall
it
would
be
he
could
see
nothing
more
and
liane
had
already
silenced
the
maid
or
rather
reduced
her
to
responses
feebly
submissive
and
consonant
with
the
nature
of
her
kind

rubbing
it
in
and
why
should
you
not
go
with
me
to
that
america
if
i
wish
it

heard
her
say
is
it
likely
i
would
leave
you
behind
to
spread
scandal
concerning
me
with
that
gabbling
tongue
in
your
head
of
an
overgrown
cabbage
it
is
some
lover
then
who
has
inspired
this
folly
in
you
tell
him
from
me
if
you
please
the
day
you
leave
my

without
my
consent
it

be

my
the
large
one
of
steel
with
the

madame
takes
all
her

then
the

enquired
moving
about
the
room
but
naturally
what
do
you
think
that
i
leave
them
here
for
the
to
give
their
maquereaux
i
shall
pack
them
tonight
before

leave

what
time
it

by
midnight

may
decide
to
make

madame

what
to

get
my

up
the

marthe
the
stairway
was
no
place
to
stop
lanyard
slipped
like
a
shadow
to
the
floor
below
and
took
shelter
behind
a
jog
in
the
wall
of
the
grand
salon
where
standing
in
deep
darkness
he
commanded
a
view
of
the
hall
the
maid
came
down
carrying
an
electric
candle
like
the
footman
its
rays
illumined
from
below
one
of
those
faces
of
crude
comeliness
common
to
her
class
the
face
of
an
animal
not
unintelligent
but
first
and
last
an
animal
with
a
hand
on
the
lower
she
hesitated
looking
up
toward
the
room
of
her
mistress
as
if
lost
in
thought
poised
thus
her
lifted
face
partly
turned
away
from
lanyard
its
expression
was
hopelessly
ambiguous
but
some
secret
thought
amused
the
woman
a
shadow
deepened
in
the
visible
corner
of
her
mouth
one
fancied
something
sardonic
in
that
covert
smile
she
went
on
down
a
latch
on
the
ground
floor
clicked
as
the
door
to
the
service
hallway
was
gently
closed
lanyard
came
out
of
hiding
with
a
fresh
enterprise
abrew
one
must
kill
time
somehow
liane
would
be
at
least
another
half
an
hour
busy
with
her
jewellery
and
the
thought
presented
itself
that
the
library
immediately
beneath
her
room
should
be
worthy
an
investigation
in
such
establishments
it
is
a
tradition
that
the
household
safe
shall
be
located
somewhere
in
the
library
and
such
are
apt
to
be
naïve
contrivances
lanyard
did
not
hope
to
find
the
montalais
jewels
stored
away
in
such
a
place
liane
would
surely
take
better
care
of
them
than
that
assuming
they
were
in
her
possession
they
would
be
under
her
hand
if
not
confused
with
her
own
treasures
still
it
could
do
no
harm
to
make
sure
confident
of
being
warned
at
need
by
his
hearing
which
was
normally
supersensitive
and
when
he
was
engaged
as
now
keyed
to
preterhuman
acuteness
he
went
coolly
about
the
business
and
at
his
first
step
found
a
portable
on
a
long
cord
and
coolly
switched
on
its
hooded
light
the
library
was
furnished
with
bulky
old
italian
pieces
of
carved
oak
not
especially
well
selected
but
suitable
enough
with
one
exception
a
ponderous
buffet
an
exquisite
bit
of
workmanship
both
in
design
and
in
detail
but
completely
out
of
place
in
a
room
of
that
character
at
least
nine
feet
in
length
it
stood
out
four
from
the
wall
three
heavy
doors
guarded
by
modern
locks
gave
access
to
the
body
beneath
its
tier
of
drawers
but
this
drew
a
frowning
stare
there
was
a
key
in
the
lock
of
the
middle
door
there
such
a
thing
as
too
much
luck
lanyard
communed
first
the
service
gate
and
door
and
now
this
ready
to
my
hand
he
swung
sharply
round
and
searched
every
shadow
in
the
room
with
the
glare
of
the
portable
lamp
but
that
was
work
of
supererogation
he
had
already
made
sure
he
was
alone
on
that
floor
placing
the
lamp
on
the
floor
and
adjusting
its
hood
so
that
it
focussed
squarely
upon
the
middle
section
of
the
buffet
he
turned
the
key
and
discovered
behind
the
door
a
small
safe
the
run
of
luck
did
not
hold
in
respect
to
this
there
was
no
key
and
the
combination
dial
was
smug
with
confidence
in
its
own
inviolable
integrity
still
lanyard
told
it
it
could
hardly
be
expected
to
know
it
had
yet
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
shade
of
the
lone
wolf
amused
by
the
conceit
lanyard
laid
hold
of
the
knob
with
steady
delicate
fingertips
that
had
not
yet
in
spite
of
years
of
honourable
idleness
forgotten
their
cunning
then
he
flattened
an
ear
to
the
cold
face
of
the
safe
to
his
informed
manipulation
the
dial
whirled
paused
reversed
turned
all
but
imperceptibly
while
the
hidden
mechanism
clicked
ground
and
thudded
softly
speaking
a
living
language
to
his
hearing
in
three
minutes
he
sat
back
on
his
heels
grasped
the
turned
it
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
the
bolts
slide
back
into
their
sockets
and
opened
the
door
wide
but
the
racked
pigeonholes
held
nothing
to
interest
him
whose
one
aim
was
the
recovery
of
the
montalais
jewels
the
safe
was
in
fact
dedicated
simply
to
the
storage
of
documents
love
letters
lanyard
mused
with
a
grimace
of
weariness
and
each
believed
no
doubt
she
cared
too
much
for
him
to
hold
her
power
to
compromise
him
good
lord
what
vanity
is
man
then
the
consideration
offered
that
property
of
real
value
might
be
hidden
behind
those
sheaves
of
papers
he
selected
a
pigeonhole
at
hazard
and
emptied
it
of
several
bundles
of
letters
all
neatly
bound
with
tape
or
faded
ribbon
and
clearly
docketed
it
held
nothing
else
whatever
but
his
eye
was
caught
by
a
great
name
endorsed
on
the
face
of
one
of
the
packages
and
reading
what
else
was
written
there
his
brows
rose
high
while
his
lips
shaped
a
soundless
whistle
if
an
inference
were
fair
liane
had
kept
not
only
such
documents
as
gave
her
power
over
others
lanyard
wondered
if
it
were
possible
he
held
in
his
hand
an
instrument
to
bend
the
woman
to
his
will
suddenly
he
put
out
a
hand
and
switched
off
the
light
a
gesture
quite
involuntary
simple
reaction
to
the
muffled
thump
of
a
chair
overturned
on
the
floor
above
sounds
of
scuffling
followed
as
if
liane
were
dancing
to
no
music
with
a
partner
then
a
groan
his
hands
moved
so
rapidly
and
deftly
that
although
he
seemed
to
rise
without
a
second
delay
the
safe
was
closed
and
the
combination
locked
when
he
did
so
the
buffet
door
was
shut
and
its
key
in
his
pocket
this
time
lanyard
ascended
the
stairs
without
heeding
what
noise
he
made
nevertheless
his
actions
were
never
awkward
or
his
approach
was
not
heard
his
arrival
on
the
upper
landing
was
unnoticed
in
an
instantaneous
pause
he
looked
into
the
room
and
saw
liane
delorme
in
a
negligee
like
a
cobweb
over
a
nightdress
even
more
sheer
kneeling
and
clawing
at
her
throat
round
which
a
heavy
silk
handkerchief
was
slowly
tightening
her
face
already
purple
with
strangulation
her
eyes
bulging
from
their
sockets
her
tongue
protruding
between
swollen
lips
a
thick
knee
was
planted
between
her
the
ends
of
the
handkerchief
were
in
the
sinewy
hands
of
albert
dupont
xvii
chez
liane
conceivably
even
a
journeyman
strangler
may
know
the
thrill
of
professional
pride
in
a
good
job
well
done
dupont
was
grinning
at
his
work
and
so
intent
upon
it
that
his
first
intimation
of
any
interference
came
when
lanyard
took
him
from
behind
broke
his
hold
upon
the
woman
and
lamentably
failed
to
break
his
back
at
the
same
time
whirled
him
round
with
a
jerk
that
all
but
unsocketed
an
arm
and
before
the
thug
could
regain
his
balance
placed
surely
on
the
heel
of
his
jaw
just
below
the
ear
a
blow
that
coming
straight
from
the
shoulder
and
carrying
all
lanyard
had
of
weight
and
force
and
will
to
punish
in
spite
of
dupont
heaviness
fairly
lifted
him
from
his
feet
and
dropped
him
backwards
across
a
from
which
he
slipped
senseless
to
the
floor
it
was
just
like
that
a
crowded
breathless
business
with
bruised
and
aching
knuckles
to
prove
that
the
blow
had
been
one
to
stun
an
ox
lanyard
believed
it
safe
to
count
dupont
hors
de
combat
for
a
time
at
least
in
any
event
the
risk
had
to
be
chanced
liane
delorme
was
in
a
plight
demanding
immediate
relief
in
all
likelihood
she
had
lost
consciousness
some
moments
before
lanyard
intervention
released
she
had
fallen
positively
inert
and
lay
on
a
shoulder
with
limbs
grotesquely
slack
and
awry
as
if
in
unpleasant
mimicry
of
a
broken
doll
only
the
whites
of
bloodshot
eyes
showed
in
her
livid
and
distorted
countenance
arms
and
legs
twitched
spasmodically
the
ample
torso
was
violently
shaken
by
labouring
lungs
the
twisted
handkerchief
round
her
throat
had
loosened
but
not
enough
to
give
relief
lanyard
removed
it
turned
her
over
so
that
she
lay
supine
wedged
silken
pillows
from
the
beneath
her
head
and
shoulders
then
reached
across
her
body
took
from
her
dressing
table
a
flask
of
lovely
italian
glass
and
drenched
her
face
and
bosom
with
its
pungent
contents
she
gasped
started
convulsively
and
began
to
breathe
with
less
effort
that
dreadful
rattling
in
her
throat
was
stilled
heavy
lids
curtained
her
eyes
lanyard
continued
to
apply
the
scented
water
with
a
lavish
hand
in
time
the
woman
shuddered
sighed
profoundly
and
looked
up
with
a
witless
stare
man
is
measurably
a
creature
of
gestures
stereotyped
when
the
world
was
young
lanyard
patted
the
woman
hand
as
one
might
comfort
an
abused
child
it
is
all
right
now
liane
he
said
in
a
reassuring
voice
rest
tranquilly
you
will
soon
be
yourself
again
but
wait
i
will
find
you
a
drink
she
said
nothing
her
look
continued
cloudy
but
the
dazed
eyes
followed
him
as
he
got
up
and
cast
about
for
a
glass
of
water
but
then
he
remembered
dupont
and
decided
that
liane
could
wait
another
minute
while
he
made
it
impossible
for
the
apache
to
do
more
mischief
he
moved
round
the
and
paused
looking
down
thoughtfully
since
his
fall
dupont
had
made
neither
moan
nor
stir
no
crescent
irides
showed
beneath
the
lids
he
was
so
motionless
he
seemed
scarcely
to
breathe
lanyard
dug
the
toe
of
a
boot
into
his
ribs
none
too
gently
but
without
satisfaction
of
any
doubts
the
fellow
gave
no
sign
of
sensibility
but
lay
utterly
relaxed
with
the
look
of
one
dead
lanyard
frowned
uneasily
he
had
seen
men
drop
dead
from
blows
less
powerful
than
his
and
though
this
one
had
well
earned
a
death
swift
and
merciless
lanyard
experienced
a
twinge
of
horror
at
the
thought
often
enough
it
had
been
his
lot
in
times
of
peace
and
war
to
be
forced
to
fight
for
life
and
more
than
once
to
kill
in
defence
of
it
but
that
had
never
happened
never
could
happen
without
his
suffering
the
bitterest
regret
even
now
in
the
case
of
this
butcher
this
ruthless
garroter
dropping
to
his
knees
lanyard
bent
over
the
body
to
search
for
symptoms
of
animation
he
perceived
them
instantly
with
inconceivable
suddenness
dupont
demonstrated
that
he
was
very
much
alive
an
arm
like
the
flexible
limb
of
a
tree
wound
itself
affectionately
round
neck
clipped
his
head
to
dupont
yearning
bosom
ground
his
face
into
the
flannel
folds
of
a
shirt
simultaneously
the
huge
body
heaved
prodigiously
and
after
a
brief
interval
of
fantastic
floppings
like
a
young
mountain
fell
on
top
of
lanyard
but
that
was
the
full
measure
of
dupont
success
in
this
stratagem
if
hopelessly
victimized
and
taken
by
surprise
lanyard
should
have
been
better
remembered
by
the
man
who
had
fought
him
at
and
again
with
others
assisting
on
the
road
to
nant
though
it
is
quite
possible
of
course
that
dupont
failed
to
recognise
his
ancient
enemy
in
monsieur
paul
martin
of
the
damp
and
bedraggled
evening
clothes
however
that
may
have
been
in
the
question
of
brute
courage
dupont
had
yet
to
prove
lacking
his
every
instinct
was
an
apache
left
to
himself
he
would
strike
always
from
behind
and
run
like
a
cur
to
cover
but
cornered
or
exasperated
by
opposition
to
his
vast
powers
something
which
he
seemed
quite
unable
to
understand
he
could
fight
like
a
maniac
he
was
hardly
better
now
when
he
found
himself
thrown
off
and
attacked
in
turn
at
a
time
when
he
believed
his
antagonist
to
be
pinned
down
helpless
at
the
mercy
of
the
weapon
for
which
he
was
fumbling
and
the
murderous
fury
which
animated
him
then
more
than
made
up
for
want
of
science
and
imagination
they
fought
for
their
most
passions
he
to
kill
lanyard
to
live
dupont
to
batter
lanyard
into
conceding
a
moment
of
respite
in
which
a
weapon
might
be
used
lanyard
to
prevent
that
very
thing
from
happening
even
as
animals
in
a
pit
they
fought
now
on
their
knees
straining
each
to
break
the
other
hold
now
wallowing
together
on
the
floor
now
on
their
feet
slogging
like
bruisers
of
the
old
school
dupont
took
punishment
in
heroic
doses
and
asked
for
more
shedding
frightful
blows
with
only
an
angry
shake
of
his
head
he
would
lower
it
and
charge
as
a
wild
boar
charges
while
his
huge
arms
flew
like
lunatic
the
cleverest
footwork
could
not
always
elude
his
tremendous
rushes
the
coolest
ducking
and
dodging
could
not
wholly
escape
that
frantic
shower
of
fists
time
and
again
lanyard
suffered
blows
that
jarred
him
to
his
heels
time
and
again
was
fain
to
give
ground
to
an
onslaught
that
drove
him
back
till
his
shoulders
touched
a
wall
and
more
than
once
toward
the
end
he
felt
his
knees
buckle
beneath
him
and
saw
his
shrewdest
efforts
fail
for
want
of
force
the
sweat
of
his
brows
stung
and
dimmed
his
eyes
his
dry
tongue
tasted
its
salt
he
staggered
in
the
drunkenness
of
fatigue
and
suffered
agonies
of
pain
for
his
exertions
had
strained
the
newly
knitted
tissues
of
the
wound
in
his
side
and
the
hurt
of
this
was
wholly
hellish
but
always
he
contrived
somehow
strangely
to
him
to
escape
annihilation
and
find
enough
in
reserve
to
fly
back
at
dupont
throat
upon
the
first
indication
of
desire
on
the
part
of
the
latter
to
yield
the
offensive
to
do
less
were
to
permit
him
to
find
and
use
his
weapon
whatever
it
might
be
whether
knife
or
pistol
was
besides
the
issue
chairs
the
tables
were
overturned
and
kicked
about
priceless
bits
of
porcelain
and
glass
lamps
vases
the
fittings
of
the
were
cast
down
in
fragments
to
the
floor
constrained
to
look
to
herself
or
be
trampled
underfoot
and
galvanized
with
terror
the
woman
struggled
up
and
tottered
hither
and
yon
like
a
bewildered
child
in
the
beginning
too
bemused
to
be
able
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
combatants
if
she
crouched
against
a
wall
battling
bodies
brushed
her
away
from
it
did
she
take
refuge
in
a
corner
she
must
abandon
it
else
be
crushed
once
she
stumbled
between
the
two
and
before
lanyard
could
thrust
her
aside
dupont
had
fallen
back
half
a
dozen
feet
and
worried
a
pistol
out
of
his
clothing
he
fired
first
from
the
hip
and
the
shot
shattered
the
mirror
of
the
trying
for
better
aim
he
lifted
and
levelled
the
weapon
with
a
trembling
arm
which
he
sought
to
steady
by
cupping
the
elbow
in
his
left
hand
but
the
second
bullet
ploughed
into
the
ceiling
as
lanyard
in
desperation
executed
a
coup
de
pied
in
la
savate
and
narrowly
succeeded
in
kicking
the
pistol
from
dupont
grasp
bereft
thus
of
his
last
hope
they
were
too
evenly
matched
and
both
too
far
spent
for
either
to
force
a
victory
with
his
naked
hands
the
apache
swung
round
and
ran
at
the
same
time
throwing
a
heavy
chair
over
on
its
back
in
the
path
of
pursuit
unable
to
avoid
it
lanyard
tried
to
hurdle
it
caught
a
foot
on
one
of
its
legs
and
as
dupont
threw
himself
headlong
down
the
stairs
crashed
to
the
floor
with
an
impact
that
shook
its
beams
main
lifted
him
to
his
knees
before
he
collapsed
his
last
ounce
of
endurance
wasted
then
the
woman
with
flying
draperies
a
figure
like
a
fury
sped
to
the
banister
rail
and
leaning
over
emptied
the
several
shots
remaining
in
dupont
automatic
down
the
well
of
the
staircase
it
is
doubtful
if
she
saw
anything
to
aim
at
or
accomplished
more
than
to
wing
the
apache
flight
dupont
had
gained
the
second
storey
while
lanyard
was
still
fighting
up
from
his
fall
the
last
report
and
the
crash
of
the
front
door
slammed
behind
dupont
were
as
one
heartbeat
to
the
next
lanyard
pillowed
his
head
on
a
forearm
and
lay
sobbing
for
breath
liane
delorme
turned
and
ran
to
the
front
of
the
house
presently
she
came
back
drooping
sank
into
a
chair
and
with
lacklustre
eyes
regarded
the
man
at
her
feet
he
got
away
she
said
superfluously
in
a
faint
voice
i
saw
him
in
the
street
staggering
like
a
sot
at
that
moment
lanyard
could
not
have
mustered
a
show
of
interest
had
he
been
told
dupont
was
returning
at
the
head
of
a
horde
he
closed
his
tired
eyes
and
envied
the
lucky
dead
whose
rest
was
independent
of
bruised
flesh
and
aching
bones
neither
he
supposed
were
dreams
poisoned
by
chagrin
when
what
was
mortal
no
longer
mattered
three
times
had
he
come
to
grips
with
dupont
and
though
he
had
been
outnumbered
on
the
road
to
nant
in
lanyard
sight
the
honours
were
far
from
easy
neither
would
they
be
while
yet
the
other
lived
or
was
at
large
the
bitterness
of
failure
and
defeat
had
so
rank
a
flavour
in
his
thoughts
that
nothing
else
in
life
concerned
him
now
he
had
forgotten
liane
delorme
for
minutes
when
her
arm
passed
beneath
his
shoulders
and
tried
to
lift
them
from
the
floor
he
looked
up
then
with
listless
eyes
and
saw
her
on
one
knee
by
his
side
giving
him
in
his
turn
that
confident
and
reassuring
smile
with
which
he
had
greeted
her
reviving
senses
a
long
long
time
ago
it
seemed
come
she
said
sit
up
monsieur
and
take
this
drink
it
will
lend
you
strength
you
need
it
god
knew
he
did
his
throat
was
like
a
furnace
flue
his
mouth
held
the
taste
of
leather
but
for
that
thirst
indeed
he
could
hardly
have
found
the
energy
to
aid
her
efforts
and
lurch
upon
an
elbow
a
lancet
pierced
his
wound
and
though
he
locked
his
teeth
against
it
a
groan
forced
out
between
them
the
woman
cried
out
at
the
rapid
ebb
of
colour
from
his
face
but
you
are
suffering
he
forced
a
grey
smile
it
is
nothing
he
whispered
hoarsely
it
will
pass
if
you
please
that
drink
she
put
a
knee
behind
his
shoulders
for
support
and
he
rested
his
head
back
upon
it
and
drank
deep
from
the
glass
which
she
held
to
his
lips
nectar
of
olympus
was
never
more
divine
than
that
deep
draught
of
brandy
and
soda
he
thought
he
quaffed
life
itself
in
its
distilled
quintessence
its
pure
elixir
his
look
of
gratitude
had
almost
the
spirit
and
the
vigour
of
himself
renewed
my
thanks
mademoiselle
your
thanks
she
laughed
with
indulgent
scorn
your
thanks
to
me
he
offered
to
rise
but
was
restrained
by
kindly
hands
no
rest
there
a
little
longer
give
yourself
a
little
time
before
you
try
to
get
up
but
i
shall
tire
you
no
and
if
you
did
what
of
that
it
seems
to
me
my
friend
i
owe
to
you
my
life
to
me
it
seems
you
do
he
agreed
but
such
a
debt
is
always
the
first
to
be
forgotten
is
it
not
you
reproach
me
no
mademoiselle
not
you
but
the
hearts
of
men
we
are
all
very
much
alike
i
think
no
the
woman
insisted
you
do
reproach
me
in
your
heart
you
have
said
has
forgotten
that
but
for
me
she
would
have
been
dead
long
years
ago
this
service
too
she
will
presently
forget
but
you
are
wrong
my
friend
it
is
true
the
years
between
had
made
that
other
time
a
little
vague
with
old
remoteness
in
my
memory
but
has
brought
it
all
back
and
a
renewed
memory
never
fades
so
one
is
told
but
trust
at
need
to
black
it
out
you
have
no
faith
in
me
she
said
bitterly
lanyard
gave
her
a
weary
smile
why
should
i
not
and
as
for
that
why
should
i
have
faith
in
you
liane
our
ways
run
leagues
apart
they
can
be
one
she
met
his
perplexed
stare
with
an
emphatic
nod
with
eyes
that
he
could
have
sworn
were
abrim
with
tenderness
he
shook
his
head
as
if
to
shake
off
a
ridiculous
plaguing
notion
and
grinned
broadly
that
was
a
drink
he
declared
i
assure
you
it
was
too
much
for
my
elderly
head
let
me
up
the
cruel
agony
stabbed
his
side
again
and
again
as
he
not
unaided
got
upon
his
feet
and
though
he
managed
to
gulp
down
his
groans
no
grinding
of
his
teeth
could
mitigate
his
recurrent
pallor
or
the
pained
contractions
of
his
eyes
furthermore
he
wavered
when
he
tried
to
walk
and
was
glad
to
subside
into
a
chair
to
which
the
woman
guided
him
then
she
fetched
him
another
brandy
and
soda
put
a
lighted
cigarette
between
his
lips
picked
up
a
chair
for
herself
and
sat
down
so
close
to
him
that
their
elbows
almost
touched
it
is
better
that
pain
monsieur
he
replied
with
an
uncertain
nod
pressing
a
careful
hand
to
his
side
wound
that
animal
gave
me
a
month
ago
which
animal
monsieur
of
the
garotte
liane
recently
the
assassin
of
de
lorgnes
before
that
the
of
the
château
de
montalais
albert
dupont
as
you
say
it
is
not
a
name
the
same
her
old
terror
revived
my
god
what
have
i
ever
done
to
that
one
that
he
should
seek
my
life
what
had
de
lorgnes
her
eyes
turned
away
she
sat
for
a
moment
in
silent
thought
started
suddenly
to
speak
but
checked
the
words
before
one
passed
her
lips
and
as
lanyard
saw
quite
plainly
hastened
to
substitute
others
no
i
do
not
understand
at
all
what
do
you
think
lanyard
indicated
a
shrug
with
sufficient
clearness
meaning
to
say
she
probably
knew
as
much
as
if
not
more
than
he
but
how
did
he
get
in
i
had
not
one
suspicion
i
was
not
alone
until
that
handkerchief
naturally
and
you
my
friend
i
saw
him
enter
and
followed
this
was
strictly
within
the
truth
lanyard
had
now
no
doubt
dupont
and
the
man
who
had
reconnoitered
from
the
were
one
but
it
was
no
part
of
his
mind
to
tell
the
whole
truth
to
liane
she
might
be
as
grateful
as
she
ought
to
be
but
she
was
still
liane
delorme
a
woman
to
be
tested
rather
than
trusted
i
must
tell
you
but
perhaps
you
knew
there
were
agents
de
police
in
the
restaurant
liane
head
described
a
negative
her
violet
eyes
were
limpid
pools
of
candour
i
am
so
much
a
stranger
in
paris
lanyard
pursued
i
would
not
know
them
but
i
thought
you
perhaps
no
no
my
friend
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
police
i
know
little
about
them
not
only
that
but
i
was
so
interested
in
our
talk
and
then
inexpressibly
shocked
i
paid
attention
to
nothing
else
i
understand
otherwise
you
must
have
noticed
who
followed
me
you
were
followed
and
she
had
found
the
effrontery
to
chide
him
for
lack
of
faith
in
her
he
was
in
pain
for
all
that
the
moment
seemed
amusing
we
are
followed
i
assure
you
lanyard
replied
gravely
one
man
or
two
i
do
know
how
many
in
a
but
you
are
sure
all
we
could
get
was
a
hansom
drawn
by
a
snail
the
automobile
running
without
lights
went
no
faster
kept
a
certain
distance
behind
us
all
the
way
from
the
place
pigalle
to
the
apartment
of
mademoiselle
reneaux
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
furthermore
when
mademoiselle
reneaux
had
persuaded
me
to
take
refuge
in
her
apartment
who
knew
what
they
designed
one
man
left
the
automobile
as
it
passed
her
door
and
stood
on
watch
across
the
way
could
one
require
proof
that
one
was
followed
then
you
think
somebody
of
the
préfecture
recognized
duchemin
in
you
who
knows
i
know
i
was
followed
watched
if
you
ask
me
i
think
paris
is
not
a
healthy
place
for
me
but
all
that
liane
objected
does
not
bring
you
here
patience
i
am
well
on
my
way
lanyard
paused
to
sip
his
brandy
and
soda
and
under
cover
of
that
summon
ingenuity
to
the
fore
here
a
little
fabrication
was
indicated
we
waited
till
about
half
an
hour
ago
so
did
the
spy
mademoiselle
reneaux
then
let
me
out
by
a
private
way
i
started
to
walk
to
my
hotel
the
chatham
there
was
a
taxi
to
be
had
you
understand
presently
i
looked
back
and
saw
i
was
being
followed
again
to
make
sure
i
ran
and
the
spy
ran
after
me
i
twisted
and
doubled
all
through
this
quarter
and
at
last
succeeded
in
shaking
him
off
then
i
turned
down
this
street
hoping
to
pick
up
a
cab
in
the
of
a
sudden
i
see
dupont
he
is
crossing
the
street
toward
this
house
he
does
not
know
me
but
quickens
his
pace
and
hastily
lets
himself
in
at
the
service
entrance
incidentally
if
i
were
you
liane
i
would
give
my
staff
of
servants
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
morning
the
door
and
gate
were
not
locked
i
am
sure
dupont
used
no
key
some
person
of
this
establishment
was
careless
or
worse
trust
me
to
look
into
that
enfin
in
his
haste
dupont
leaves
the
door
as
he
found
it
i
take
a
moment
thought
it
is
plain
he
is
here
for
no
good
purpose
i
follow
him
in
the
state
of
this
room
tells
the
rest
it
is
no
matter
the
woman
reviewed
the
ruins
of
her
boudoir
with
an
apathetic
glance
which
was
however
anything
but
apathetic
when
she
turned
it
back
to
lanyard
face
bending
forward
she
closed
a
hand
upon
his
arm
emotion
troubled
her
accents
my
friend
my
dear
friend
tell
me
what
i
can
do
to
repay
you
help
me
said
lanyard
simply
holding
her
eyes
how
is
that
help
you
to
make
my
honour
clear
speaking
rapidly
and
with
unfeigned
feeling
he
threw
himself
upon
her
generosity
you
know
i
am
no
more
what
i
was
once
in
this
paris
when
you
first
knew
me
you
know
i
have
given
up
all
that
for
years
i
have
fought
an
uphill
fight
to
live
down
that
evil
fame
in
which
i
once
rejoiced
now
i
stand
accused
of
two
crimes
two
two
in
one
i
hardly
know
which
is
the
greater
that
of
stealing
or
that
of
violating
the
hospitality
and
confidence
of
those
good
ladies
of
the
château
de
montalais
i
can
not
rest
while
they
think
me
guilty
and
not
they
alone
but
all
my
friends
and
i
have
made
good
friends
in
france
and
england
so
if
you
think
you
owe
me
anything
liane
help
me
to
find
and
restore
the
montalais
jewels
liane
delorme
sat
back
her
hand
lifted
from
his
arm
and
fell
with
a
helpless
gesture
her
eyes
mirrored
no
more
guile
than
a
child
yet
her
accent
was
that
of
one
who
remonstrates
but
with
forbearance
against
unreasonable
demands
how
can
i
do
that
and
she
had
protested
her
gratitude
to
him
he
knew
that
she
was
lying
anger
welled
in
lanyard
heart
but
he
was
able
to
hold
it
in
leash
and
let
no
sign
of
it
show
in
manner
or
expression
you
have
much
influence
he
suggested
here
in
paris
with
people
of
many
classes
a
word
from
you
here
a
question
there
pressure
exerted
in
certain
quarters
will
help
me
more
than
all
the
powers
of
préfecture
and
surété
combined
you
know
that
let
me
think
she
was
staring
at
the
floor
you
must
give
me
time
i
will
do
what
i
can
i
promise
you
that
perhaps
she
met
his
gaze
again
but
he
saw
something
crafty
in
her
smile
i
have
a
scheme
already
in
mind
we
will
discuss
that
in
the
morning
when
i
have
slept
on
it
you
give
me
new
hope
lanyard
finished
his
drink
and
made
as
if
to
rise
but
relapsed
a
spasm
of
pain
knotting
his
face
afraid
i
must
have
a
cab
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
if
you
could
lend
me
a
coat
of
some
sort
to
cover
these
rags
and
indeed
his
evening
clothes
had
fared
badly
in
their
first
social
adventure
but
if
you
think
i
dream
of
letting
you
leave
this
house
in
pain
and
perhaps
to
run
into
the
arms
of
the
police
you
little
know
me
monsieur
michael
lanyard
paul
martin
if
you
do
mind
the
guest
rooms
are
there
she
waved
a
hand
to
indicate
the
front
part
of
the
house
on
that
floor
you
will
find
everything
you
need
to
make
you
comfortable
for
and
in
the
morning
i
will
send
to
the
chatham
for
your
things
or
perhaps
it
would
be
wiser
to
wait
till
we
are
sure
the
police
are
not
watching
there
for
your
return
but
if
they
are
it
will
be
a
simple
matter
to
find
suitable
clothing
for
you
meanwhile
we
will
have
arrived
at
an
understanding
you
comprehend
monsieur
i
am
resolved
this
affair
is
now
arranged
i
am
well
content
liane
and
that
was
true
enough
whatever
she
had
in
mind
for
him
she
was
only
playing
into
his
hands
when
she
proposed
to
keep
him
near
her
he
managed
to
get
out
of
the
chair
and
accepted
the
offer
of
her
arm
but
held
back
for
a
moment
but
your
servants
well
monsieur
what
of
them
for
one
thing
they
sleep
sincerely
there
are
walls
between
their
part
of
the
house
and
this
more
than
that
they
are
forbidden
to
intrude
no
matter
what
may
happen
unless
i
summon
them
but
in
the
morning
liane
when
they
regard
this
wreckage
i
am
afraid
they
will
think
me
a
tempestuous
lover
they
will
find
me
a
tempestuous

the
storm
had
passed
off
an
ardent
noonday
sun
was
collaborating
with
a
coquettish
breeze
to
make
gay
the
window
awnings
of
the
chamber
where
lanyard
in
borrowed
pyjamas
and
of
silk
lay
luxuriously
bedded
listening
to
the
purr
of
paris
and
with
an
excellent
cigar
to
chew
on
ruminating
upon
the
problematic
issue
of
his
latest
turn
of
fortune
and
not
in
the
least
downhearted
about
it
before
turning
in
he
had
soaked
and
steamed
most
of
the
ache
out
of
bone
and
muscle
in
the
hottest
water
his
flesh
would
suffer
and
six
hours
unbroken
slumber
had
done
wonders
toward
lessening
the
distress
his
exertions
last
night
had
occasioned
in
the
frail
new
tissues
of
his
wound
now
fresh
from
a
cold
shower
following
a
second
hot
bath
and
further
comforted
by
a
petit
déjeuner
served
in
bed
he
felt
measurably
sane
again
and
sound
in
wind
and
limb
as
well
barring
a
few
deep
bruises
whose
soreness
would
need
several
days
to
heal
a
pleasant
languour
like
a
light
opiate
infused
his
consciousness
yet
he
was
by
no
means
mentally
inactive
the
morning
papers
were
scattered
over
the
counterpane
lanyard
had
diligently
scanned
all
the
stories
that
told
of
the
identification
of
the
murdered
man
of
the
lyons
rapide
as
the
comte
de
lorgnes
and
inasmuch
as
these
were
of
one
voice
in
praising
the
préfecture
for
that
famous
feat
of
detective
work
and
not
one
line
suggested
that
it
did
not
deserve
undivided
credit
lanyard
had
nothing
to
complain
of
there
as
for
the
montalais
robbery
it
was
not
even
mentioned
the
restricted
size
imposed
upon
french
newspapers
by
the
paper
shortage
of
those
days
crowded
out
of
their
columns
everything
but
news
in
true
sense
and
there
could
be
none
of
that
in
connection
with
the
montalais
affair
until
either
andré
duchemin
had
been
arrested
or
the
jewels
recovered
from
the
real
thief
or
thieves
and
lanyard
was
human
enough
to
be
almost
as
willing
to
have
the
first
happen
as
the
last
if
it
were
not
given
to
him
to
be
the
prime
factor
in
their
restoration
for
the
time
being
if
he
must
confess
the
truth
he
was
actually
rather
enjoying
himself
rather
exhilarated
than
otherwise
by
the
swiftly
shifting
scenes
and
characters
of
his
unfolding
investigations
and
by
the
brisk
of
wits
in
which
he
was
called
upon
constantly
to
engage
both
essential
ingredients
of
the
wine
of
life
according
to
the
one
recipe
he
knew
and
then
a
review
of
recent
events
seemed
to
warrant
the
belief
that
all
things
considered
he
had
thus
far
made
fair
progress
toward
his
goal
while
it
was
true
he
did
not
as
yet
know
what
had
become
of
the
montalais
jewels
he
had
gathered
together
an
accumulation
of
evidence
which
however
circumstantial
and
hypothetical
established
acceptably
to
his
intelligence
a
number
of
interesting
inferences
to
wit
that
dupont
had
not
left
the
neighbourhood
of
the
château
de
montalais
after
haunting
it
for
upwards
of
a
month
without
definite
knowledge
that
he
would
gain
nothing
by
staying
on
or
without
an
equally
definite
objective
some
motive
more
inspiring
than
such
simple
sensuousness
as
he
might
find
in
assassinating
inoffensive
folk
indiscriminately
that
his
attempt
upon
the
life
of
liane
delorme
within
hours
of
the
murder
of
de
lorgnes
indicated
conviction
on
his
part
that
the
two
were
coupled
in
some
enterprise
inimical
to
his
personal
interests
that
in
spite
of
his
mask
of
a
stupid
pig
dumont
was
proving
himself
mentally
as
well
as
physically
an
adversary
worthy
of
all
respect
and
was
what
was
worse
still
to
be
reckoned
with
that
as
lanyard
had
suspected
all
along
the
monk
party
had
been
visited
upon
the
château
de
montalais
through
no
vagary
of
chance
whatever
but
as
part
of
a
deliberate
design
whose
ulterior
motive
had
transpired
only
with
the
disappearance
of
the
jewels
to
dupont
vast
but
understandable
vexation
of
spirit
that
the
several
members
of
the
monk
party
had
been
working
in
entire
accord
as
a
close
corporation
in
which
case
the
person
whom
the
comte
de
lorgnes
had
expected
to
meet
in
lyons
must
have
been
monk
phinuit
or
jules
consequently
that
at
least
one
of
the
three
last
named
had
been
the
actual
perpetrator
of
the
robbery
and
by
the
same
token
that
liane
had
lied
in
asserting
that
monk
and
retinue
had
sailed
for
america
nearly
a
week
prior
to
its
commission
that
liane
herself
had
not
so
suddenly
decided
to
leave
france
where
she
was
after
a
fashion
somebody
and
journey
to
america
where
she
would
be
nobody
except
in
stress
of
mortal
fear
lest
the
fate
that
had
befallen
de
lorgnes
befall
her
in
turn
as
would
surely
have
been
the
case
last
night
but
for
lanyard
that
she
must
therefore
have
had
a
tolerably
accurate
knowledge
either
of
dupont
identity
or
of
the
opposition
interests
which
that
one
so
ably
represented
and
thus
was
better
informed
than
poor
de
lorgnes
to
whom
dupont
had
been
unknown
which
argued
that
liane
rôle
in
the
intrigue
was
that
of
a
principal
whereas
de
lorgnes
had
figured
only
as
a
subordinate
that
even
if
the
woman
did
mean
well
toward
lanyard
she
was
bound
by
stronger
ties
to
others
whom
she
must
consider
first
and
who
were
hardly
likely
to
prove
so
well
disposed
that
her
protestations
of
friendship
and
gratitude
must
be
valued
accordingly
summing
up
lanyard
told
himself
he
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
let
grass
grow
under
his
feet
since
leaving
château
de
montalais
now
he
found
himself
with
a
solitary
care
to
nurse
the
question
what
had
her
pillow
advised
liane
delorme
he
was
going
to
be
exceedingly
interested
to
learn
what
she
in
the
maturity
of
her
judgement
had
decided
to
do
about
this
man
who
ingenuously
suggested
that
she
requite
him
for
saving
her
life
by
helping
him
recover
the
montalais
jewels
on
the
other
hand
since
lanyard
had
quite
decided
what
he
meant
to
do
about
liane
in
any
event
her
decision
really
did
matter
much
and
he
refused
to
fret
himself
trying
to
forecast
it
whatever
it
might
turn
out
to
be
it
would
find
him
prepared
he
could
be
surprised
there
lanyard
was
wrong
liane
was
amply
able
to
surprise
him
and
did
ultimately
he
felt
constrained
to
concede
a
touch
to
genius
in
the
woman
her
methods
were
her
own
and
never
poor
in
boldness
and
imagination
it
was
without
ceremony
that
she
walked
in
on
him
at
length
having
kept
him
waiting
so
long
that
he
had
begun
to
wonder
if
she
meant
to
try
on
anything
as
crude
as
abandoning
him
and
posting
off
to
cherbourg
without
a
word
to
seek
fancied
immunity
in
new
york
while
he
remained
in
an
empty
house
without
money
papers
of
identification
or
even
fit
clothing
for
the
street
for
on
coming
out
of
his
bath
lanyard
had
found
all
of
these
things
missing
the
valet
de
chambre
presumably
having
made
off
with
his
evening
clothes
to
have
them
pressed
and
repaired
liane
was
dressed
for
travelling
becomingly
if
with
a
sobriety
that
went
oddly
with
her
cultivated
beauté
du
diable
and
wore
besides
a
habit
of
preoccupation
which
one
was
left
to
assume
excused
the
informality
of
her
unannounced
entrance
well
my
dear
friend
she
said
gravely
halting
by
the
bedside
it
about
time
lanyard
retorted
i
was
afraid
you
might
be
growing
impatient
she
confessed
i
have
had
so
much
to
do
no
doubt
but
if
you
had
neglected
me
much
longer
i
should
have
come
to
look
for
you
regardless
of
consequences
how
is
that
she
enquired
with
knitted
brows
regardless
of
what
consequences
any
damage
one
might
do
to
the
morale
of
your
ménage
by
toddling
about
in
the
voluptuous
déshabillé
in
which
you
behold
me
my
sole
present
apology
for
a
wardrobe
she
found
only
the
shadow
of
a
smile
for
such
frivolity
i
have
sent
for
clothing
for
you
she
said
absently
it
should
be
here
any
minute
now
we
only
wait
for
that
you
mean
you
have
sent
to
the
chatham
for
my
things
but
certainly
not
monsieur
liane
delorme
lied
without
perceptible
effort
that
would
have
been
too
injudicious
it
appears
you
were
not
mistaken
in
thinking
you
were
recognized
as
andré
duchemin
last
night
agents
of
the
préfecture
have
been
all
day
watching
at
the
chatham
awaiting
your
return
how
sad
for
them
in
as
much
as
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
this
to
be
outright
falsehood
lanyard
did
feel
called
upon
to
seem
downcast
but
if
my
clothing
there
is
unavailable
i
hardly
see
but
naturally
i
have
commissioned
a
person
of
good
judgement
to
outfit
you
from
the
shops
your
dress
clothes
which
seemed
to
suit
you
very
well
last
night
gave
us
your
measurements
the
rest
is
simplicity
my
orders
were
to
get
you
everything
you
could
possibly
require
it
awfully
sporting
of
you
lanyard
insisted
although
it
makes
one
feel
you
know
not
quite
respectable
however
if
you
will
be
so
gracious
as
to
suggest
that
your
valet
de
chambre
return
my
pocketbook
and
passports
i
have
them
here
the
woman
turned
over
the
missing
articles
but
she
demanded
with
an
interest
which
was
undissembled
if
tardy
in
finding
expression
how
are
you
feeling
oh
quite
fit
thank
you
in
good
spirits
i
know
but
that
wound
lanyard
chose
to
make
more
of
that
than
it
deserved
one
could
tell
when
an
interesting
disability
might
prove
useful
i
have
to
be
a
bit
careful
he
confessed
covering
the
seat
of
injury
with
a
tender
hand
but
it
nothing
like
so
troublesome
as
it
was
last
night
i
am
glad
you
feel
able
to
travel
travel
lanyard
made
a
face
of
dismay
but
one
is
so
delightfully
at
ease
here
and
since
the
prefecture
can
not
possibly
suspect
are
you
then
in
such
haste
to
be
rid
of
me
liane
not
at
all
it
is
my
wish
and
intention
to
accompany
you
well
let
us
trust
the
world
will
be
about
it
and
pardon
my
not
rising
wo
you
sit
down
and
tell
me
what
it
is
all
about
i
have
so
little
time
so
many
things
to
attend
to
nevertheless
liane
found
herself
a
chair
and
accepted
a
cigarette
does
one
infer
that
we
start
on
our
travels
within
the
hour
in
fact
as
soon
as
you
are
decently
clothed
and
where
do
we
go
mademoiselle
to
cherbourg
there
to
take
steamer
for
new
york
fortunately
it
was
lanyard
cue
to
register
shock
it
would
have
cost
him
something
to
have
kept
secret
his
stupefaction
he
sank
back
upon
his
pillows
and
waggled
feeble
hands
while
his
respect
for
liane
grew
by
bounds
she
had
succeeded
in
startling
and
mystifying
him
beyond
expression
what
dodge
was
this
that
cloaked
itself
in
such
anomalous
semblance
of
good
faith
she
had
not
known
he
was
acquainted
with
her
plan
to
leave
france
he
had
discounted
a
hundred
devices
to
keep
it
from
his
knowledge
and
now
she
not
only
confessed
it
openly
but
invited
him
to
go
with
her
in
the
name
of
unreason
why
she
knew
for
he
had
owned
his
possessing
purpose
he
did
not
for
an
instant
believe
liane
delorme
would
fly
france
and
leave
behind
the
montalais
jewels
did
she
think
he
did
not
suspect
her
of
knowing
more
about
them
than
she
had
chosen
to
admit
did
she
imagine
that
he
was
one
of
those
who
can
see
only
that
which
is
in
the
distance
did
she
do
him
the
injustice
to
believe
him
incapable
of
actually
smelling
out
the
jewels
if
ever
he
got
within
range
of
them
but
conjecture
was
too
idle
liane
was
too
deep
for
him
her
intent
would
declare
itself
when
she
willed
it
not
before
unless
he
could
lull
her
into
a
false
sense
of
faith
in
him
trick
her
into
betraying
herself
by
inadvertence
but
my
dear
friend
why
america
you
recall
asking
me
to
help
you
last
night
did
i
not
promise
to
do
what
i
could
well
i
am
not
one
to
forget
my
promise
i
know
something
monsieur
i
believe
you
do
you
gave
me
credit
for
having
some
little
influence
in
this
world
of
paris
i
have
used
it
what
i
have
learned
i
shall
not
tell
you
how
specifically
enables
me
to
assure
you
that
the
montalais
jewels
are
on
their
way
to
america
and
i
am
to
believe
you
make
this
journey
to
help
me
regain
them
what
do
you
think
then
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
mademoiselle
i
am
overwhelmed
abashed
and
humbled
by
contemplation
of
such
generosity
you
see
you
do
not
know
me
monsieur
but
you
shall
know
me
better
before
we
are
finished
one
does
not
question
that
nor
did
one
but
if
i
am
to
sail
for
america
from
cherbourg
at
eight
in
the
morning
well
then
but
how
am
i
to
get
my
passport
vised
i
have
seen
to
that
if
you
will
look
over
your
papers
monsieur
you
will
see
that
you
are
no
longer
paul
martin
alias
andré
duchemin
but
paul
delorme
my
invalid
brother
still
suffering
from
honourable
wounds
sustained
in
the
great
war
and
ordered
abroad
for
his
health
to
this
lanyard
hastily
verifying
her
statement
by
running
an
eye
through
the
passport
found
nothing
more
appropriate
than
a
wondering
mon
dieu
so
you
see
everything
is
arranged
what
have
you
to
say
only
that
mademoiselle
sweeps
one
off
one
feet
do
you
complain
about
that
you
no
longer
doubt
my
devotion
my
gratitude
do
not
believe
me
capable
of
such
stupidity
that
is
very
well
then
now
i
must
run
liane
delorme
threw
away
her
cigarette
and
rose
i
have
a
thousand
things
to
do
and
you
understand
we
leave
as
soon
as
you
are
dressed
perfectly
by
what
train
by
no
train
do
you
know
there
is
a
strike
what
have
you
been
reading
in
those
newspapers
it
is
necessary
that
we
motor
to
cherbourg
that
is
no
little
journey
dear
sister
three
hundred
and
seventy
kilometres
liane
delorme
held
this
equivalent
of
and
thirty
english
miles
in
supreme
contempt
we
shall
make
it
in
eight
hours
we
leave
at
four
at
latest
possibly
earlier
at
midnight
we
are
in
cherbourg
you
shall
see
if
i
survive
have
no
fear
my
chauffeur
drives
superbly
she
was
at
the
door
when
lanyard
stayed
her
with
one
moment
liane
with
fingers
resting
lightly
on
the
knob
she
turned
speak
english
he
requested
briefly
what
about
dupont
simple
mention
of
the
man
was
enough
to
make
the
woman
wince
and
lose
colour
before
she
replied
lanyard
saw
the
tip
of
her
tongue
furtively
moisten
her
lips
well
and
what
of
him
do
you
imagine
he
has
had
enough
who
knows
i
for
one
shall
feel
safe
from
him
only
when
i
knew
he
is
in
the
santé
or
his
grave
suppose
he
tries
to
follow
us
to
cherbourg
or
to
stop
us
on
the
way
how
should
he
know
tell
me
who
left
the
doors
open
for
him
last
night
and
i
will
answer
that
question
the
woman
looked
more
than
ever
frightened
but
shook
her
head
you
did
fail
to
question
the
servants
this
morning
yet
learned
nothing
it
was
impossible
to
fix
the
blame
have
you
used
all
your
intelligence
i
wonder
what
do
you
mean
have
you
reflected
that
since
dupont
got
in
after
you
came
home
his
accomplice
in
your
household
is
most
probably
one
of
those
who
were
up
at
that
hour
who
were
they
only
two
the
footman
leon
you
trust
him
not
altogether
now
you
make
me
think
i
shall
discharge
him
when
i
leave
without
notice
wait
who
else
marthe
my
maid
you
have
confidence
in
her
loyalty
implicit
she
has
been
with
me
for
years
lanyard
said
open
that
door
in
a
tone
sharp
with
such
authority
that
liane
delorme
instinctively
obeyed
and
the
woman
whom
lanyard
had
seen
that
morning
coming
down
the
stairs
with
the
lighted
candle
entered
rather
precipitately
carrying
over
one
arm
an
evening
wrap
of
gold
brocade
and
fur
pardon
madame
she
murmured
and
paused
aside
from
the
awkwardness
of
her
entrance
she
betrayed
no
confusion
i
was
about
to
knock
and
ask
if
madame
wished
me
to
pack
this
you
know
very
well
i
shall
need
it
liane
said
ominously
a
look
from
lanyard
checked
a
tirade
or
more
exactly
compressed
it
into
a
single
word
imbécile
yes
madame
marthe
hinted
at
rather
than
executed
a
courtesy
and
withdrew
liane
shut
the
door
behind
her
and
reapproached
the
bed
trembling
with
an
anger
that
rendered
her
forgetful
so
that
she
relapsed
into
french
you
think
she
was
listening
english
please
to
this
lanyard
added
a
slight
it
is
hard
to
believe
liane
averred
unhappily
after
all
these
years
i
have
been
kind
to
that
one
too
ah
well
at
least
you
know
now
she
will
bear
watching
you
mean
to
take
her
with
you
i
did
until
this
happened
we
quarrelled
about
it
last
night
i
think
she
has
a
lover
here
in
paris
and
does
want
to
leave
him
and
now
will
you
tell
me
that
dupont
knows
nothing
of
your
intention
to
motor
to
cherbourg
today
no
disconsolate
liane
sank
down
into
the
chair
and
resting
an
elbow
on
the
arm
clipped
her
chin
in
one
hand
now
i
dare
not
go
she
mused
aloud
yet
i
must
what
am
i
to
do
courage
little
sister
it
is
i
who
have
an
idea
liane
lifted
a
gaze
of
mute
enquiry
i
think
we
are
now
agreed
it
rests
between
marthe
and
the
footman
leon
this
treachery
she
assented
very
well
then
let
them
run
the
risks
any
further
disloyalty
may
have
prepared
for
us
i
do
not
understand
what
automobile
are
you
using
for
our
trip
this
afternoon
my
limousine
for
you
and
me
and
marthe
how
is
she
to
make
the
journey
in
the
touring
car
which
follows
us
with
our
luggage
it
is
fast
this
touring
car
the
best
money
can
buy
now
tell
me
what
you
know
about
the
chauffeur
who
drives
the
limousine
he
is
absolutely
to
be
trusted
you
have
had
him
long
in
your
employ
the
woman
hesitated
looked
aside
bit
her
lip
as
a
matter
of
fact
monsieur
she
said
hastily
trying
to
cover
her
loss
of
countenance
with
rapid
speech
it
is
the
boy
who
drove
us
through
the
cévennes
monsieur
monk
asked
me
to
keep
him
pending
his
return
to
france
you
understand
he
is
not
to
be
away
long
monsieur
monk
only
a
few
weeks
so
it
would
have
been
extravagant
to
take
jules
back
to
america
for
that
little
time
you
see
lanyard
had
the
grace
to
keep
a
straight
face
he
nodded
gravely
you
make
it
all
perfectly
clear
little
sister
and
the
driver
of
the
touring
car
are
you
sure
of
him
i
think
so
but
you
do
not
tell
me
what
you
have
in
mind
simply
this
at
the
last
moment
you
will
decide
to
take
leon
with
you
give
him
no
more
time
than
he
needs
to
pack
a
handbag
trump
up
some
excuse
and
let
him
follow
with
marthe
no
difficulty
about
that
he
is
an
excellent
driver
leon
he
served
me
as
chauffeur
and
made
a
good
one
too
for
a
year
before
i
took
him
into
the
house
at
his
request
he
said
he
was
tired
of
driving
but
if
the
man
i
had
meant
to
use
is
indisposed
trust
me
to
see
that
he
is
i
can
call
on
leon
to
take
care
of
marthe
and
our
luggage
in
the
touring
car
excellent
now
presuming
dupont
to
be
well
informed
we
may
safely
bank
on
his
attempting
nothing
before
nightfall
road
traps
can
be
too
easily
perceived
at
a
distance
by
daylight
toward
evening
then
we
will
let
the
touring
car
catch
up
you
will
express
a
desire
to
continue
in
it
because
because
of
any
excuse
that
comes
into
your
head
at
all
events
we
will
exchange
cars
with
marthe
and
leon
leaving
the
latter
to
bring
on
the
limousine
while
jules
drives
for
us
whatever
happens
then
we
may
feel
sure
the
touring
car
will
get
off
lightly
for
whether
they
involved
with
dupont
or
not
leon
and
marthe
are
small
fry
not
the
fish
he
angling
for
but
will
not
leon
and
marthe
suspect
and
refuse
to
follow
perhaps
they
may
suspect
but
they
will
follow
out
of
curiosity
to
see
how
we
fare
if
for
nothing
else
you
may
lose
a
limousine
but
you
can
afford
to
risk
that
as
long
as
you
are
not
in
it
eh
little
sister
my
dear
brother
liane
cried
deeply
moved
she
leaned
forward
and
caressed
lanyard
hand
with
sisterly
warmth
in
her
admiration
and
gratification
loosing
upon
him
the
full
of
the
violet
eyes
in
their
most
disastrous
smile
what
a
head
to
have
in
the
family
take
care
lanyard
admonished
i
admit
it
not
half
bad
at
times
but
if
this
battered
old
headpiece
of
mine
is
to
be
of
any
further
service
to
us
liane
you
must
be
careful
not
to
turn
it
xix
six
bottles
of
champagne
once
decided
upon
a
course
of
action
liane
delorme
demonstrated
that
she
could
move
with
energy
and
decision
uncommon
in
her
kind
under
her
masterly
supervision
preparations
accomplished
themselves
as
it
were
by
magic
it
was
for
example
nearer
three
than
four
when
the
expedition
for
cherbourg
left
the
door
of
her
and
paris
by
way
of
the
porte
de
neuilly
the
limousine
leading
with
that
polished
pattern
of
a
chauffeur
jules
at
its
wheel
as
spick
and
span
firm
of
jaw
and
imperturbable
of
eye
as
when
lanyard
had
first
noticed
him
in
nant
the
touring
car
trailing
with
the
footman
leon
as
driver
and
not
at
all
happy
to
find
himself
drafted
in
that
capacity
if
one
might
judge
by
a
sullen
sort
of
uneasiness
in
his
look
nothing
was
to
be
expected
in
the
streets
or
suburbs
neither
speed
nor
any
indication
of
the
intentions
if
any
of
dupont
lanyard
spared
himself
the
thankless
trouble
of
watching
to
see
if
they
were
followed
having
little
doubt
they
were
and
took
his
ease
by
the
side
of
liane
delorme
chatting
of
old
times
or
sitting
in
grateful
silence
when
liane
relapsed
into
abstraction
something
which
she
did
with
a
frequency
which
testified
to
the
heavy
pressure
of
her
thoughts
he
kept
an
appreciative
eye
on
jules
conceding
at
length
that
liane
adjective
superb
had
been
fitly
applied
to
his
driving
so
long
as
he
remained
at
the
wheel
they
were
not
only
in
safe
hands
but
might
be
sure
of
losing
nothing
on
the
road
it
was
in
that
lanyard
first
noticed
the
grey
touring
car
but
for
mental
selection
of
germain
as
the
likeliest
spot
for
dupont
to
lay
in
waiting
and
thanks
also
to
an
error
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
that
one
he
must
have
missed
it
for
there
was
nothing
strikingly
sinister
in
the
aspect
of
that
grey
car
with
the
capacious
hood
betokening
a
motor
of
great
power
but
it
stood
incongruously
round
the
corner
in
a
mean
side
street
as
if
anxious
to
escape
observation
its
juxtaposition
to
the
door
of
a
wine
shop
of
the
lowest
class
was
noticeable
in
a
car
of
such
high
caste
and
what
was
finally
damning
the
man
of
lyons
was
lounging
in
the
door
of
the
wine
shop
sucking
at
a
cigarette
and
watching
the
traffic
with
an
all
too
listless
eye
shaded
by
the
visor
of
a
shabby
cap
lanyard
said
nothing
at
the
time
but
later
when
a
long
stretch
of
straight
road
gave
him
the
chance
verified
his
suspicions
by
looking
back
to
see
the
grey
car
lurking
not
less
than
a
mile
and
a
half
astern
the
delorme
touring
car
driven
by
leon
keeping
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
the
rear
of
the
limousine
these
relative
positions
remained
approximately
unchanged
during
most
of
the
light
hours
of
that
long
evening
despite
the
terrific
pace
which
jules
set
in
the
open
country
lanyard
keeping
an
eye
on
the
indicator
saw
its
hand
register
the
equivalent
of
sixty
english
miles
an
hour
more
frequently
than
not
it
seldom
dropped
below
fifty
except
when
passing
through
towns
or
villages
and
more
often
than
he
liked
lanyard
watched
it
creep
up
to
and
past
the
mark
seventy
with
such
driving
he
was
quite
willing
to
believe
that
they
would
see
cherbourg
or
heaven
by
midnight
if
not
before
always
of
course
providing
for
the
first
three
hours
leon
stood
the
pace
well
then
nerves
or
physical
endurance
began
to
fail
he
dropped
back
and
the
delorme
touring
car
was
thereafter
seldom
visible
no
more
for
that
matter
was
the
grey
shadow
lanyard
forecast
seemed
to
be
borne
out
by
its
conduct
dupont
was
biding
his
time
and
would
undoubtedly
attempt
nothing
before
nightfall
in
the
meantime
he
was
making
no
effort
to
do
more
than
keep
step
with
the
limousine
but
at
a
decent
distance
only
occasionally
when
for
this
reason
or
that
jules
was
obliged
to
run
at
reduced
speed
for
several
minutes
on
end
the
grey
car
would
draw
into
sight
always
however
about
a
mile
behind
the
delorme
touring
car
at
about
seven
they
dined
on
the
wing
from
the
hamper
which
with
liane
jewel
case
in
its
leather
disguise
of
a
simple
travelling
bag
constituted
all
the
limousine
load
of
luggage
lanyard
passed
sandwiches
through
the
front
window
to
jules
who
munched
them
while
driving
like
a
speed
maniac
and
with
the
same
appalling
nonchalance
washed
them
down
with
a
tumbler
of
champagne
then
he
discovered
some
manner
of
sorcerous
power
over
matches
in
the
wind
lighted
a
cigarette
and
signalised
his
sense
of
refreshment
by
smoothly
edging
the
indicator
needle
up
toward
the
eighty
notch
where
he
held
it
stationary
until
lanyard
and
liane
with
one
accord
begged
him
to
consider
their
appetites
at
eight
they
were
passing
through
lisieux
one
hundred
and
eighteen
miles
from
paris
lanyard
made
mental
calculations
the
light
will
hold
till
after
nine
he
informed
liane
by
that
time
we
shall
have
left
caen
behind
i
understand
she
said
coolly
it
will
be
then
after
caen
presumably
another
hour
of
peace
of
mind
she
yawned
delicately
i
think
i
am
bored
by
this
speed
i
think
i
shall
have
a
nap
composedly
she
arranged
pillows
put
her
pretty
feet
upon
the
jewel
case
and
turning
her
face
from
lanyard
dozed
i
think
he
reflected
that
the
world
is
more
rich
in
remarkable
women
than
in
remarkable
men
a
luminous
lilac
twilight
vied
with
the
street
lamps
of
caen
when
the
limousine
rolled
through
the
city
at
moderate
speed
lanyard
utilized
this
occasion
to
confer
with
jules
through
the
window
beyond
the
town
he
said
you
will
stop
just
round
the
first
suitable
turning
so
that
we
ca
be
seen
before
the
corner
is
turned
draw
off
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
i
think
it
would
be
advisable
to
have
a
little
engine
trouble
very
good
sir
said
jules
without
looking
round
then
he
added
in
a
voice
of
complete
respect
pardon
sir
but
madame
orders
if
they
are
not
lanyard
was
nettled
she
will
countermand
them
quite
so
sir
and
if
you
do
mind
my
asking
what
the
idea
i
presume
you
set
some
value
on
your
skin
plumb
crazy
about
it
mademoiselle
delorme
and
i
are
afflicted
with
the
same
idiosyncrasy
we
want
to
save
our
lives
and
we
do
mind
saving
yours
at
the
same
time
that
more
than
fair
with
me
but
is
that
all
i
to
know
if
the
information
is
any
comfort
to
you
in
a
grey
car
which
has
been
following
us
ever
since
we
left
germain
is
the
man
who
i
believe
murdered
monsieur
le
comte
de
lorgnes
on
the
lyons
rapide
and
who
i
know
tried
last
night
to
murder
mademoiselle
delorme
and
i
suppose
that
in
his
wholesaler
way
he
mind
making
a
bag
of
the
lot
of
us
tonight
i
afraid
you
have
reason
if
you
planning
to
put
a
crimp
in
his
ambitions
sir
i
got
a
pistol
i
know
how
to
use
better
have
it
handy
though
i
do
think
we
need
it
yet
our
present
plan
is
merely
to
change
cars
with
leon
and
marthe
the
grey
car
will
pass
and
go
on
ahead
before
we
make
the
shift
then
you
mademoiselle
and
i
follow
in
the
touring
car
the
others
in
the
limousine
if
there
a
trap
as
we
have
every
reason
to
anticipate
there
will
the
touring
car
will
get
through
or
we
hope
so
jules
used
the
tone
of
one
who
perceives
enlightenment
as
a
blinding
flash
marthe
and
leon
are
in
on
the
dirty
work
too
eh
what
makes
you
think
that
putting
two
and
two
together
what
you
just
told
me
with
what
been
noticing
and
wondering
about
then
you
think
those
two
marthe
and
leon
jules
pronounced
with
deliberation
are
two
very
bad
eggs
if
you
ask
me
i
sha
shed
a
solitary
tear
if
something
sad
happens
to
them
in
this
there
was
no
time
then
to
delve
into
his
reasons
for
this
statement
of
feeling
the
outskirts
of
caen
were
dropping
behind
providentially
the
first
bend
in
the
road
to
bayeux
afforded
good
cover
on
the
side
toward
the
town
jules
shut
off
the
power
as
he
made
the
turn
and
braked
to
a
dead
stop
in
lee
of
a
row
of
outhouses
lanyard
was
on
the
ground
as
soon
as
the
wheels
ceased
to
turn
jules
almost
as
quickly
now
for
your
engine
trouble
lanyard
instructed
nothing
serious
you
understand
simply
an
adjustment
to
excuse
a
few
minutes
delay
and
lend
colour
to
our
impatience
got
you
the
first
time
jules
replied
unlatching
and
raising
one
wing
of
the
hood
lanyard
moved
toward
the
middle
of
the
road
and
flagged
the
delorme
touring
car
as
it
rounded
the
turn
a
few
seconds
later
at
such
speed
that
leon
was
put
to
it
to
stop
the
car
fifty
yards
beyond
the
limousine
the
man
jumped
down
and
followed
by
the
maid
ran
back
but
before
he
reached
the
limousine
was
obliged
to
jump
aside
to
escape
the
grey
car
which
tooled
by
a
crack
racing
hand
took
the
corner
on
two
wheels
then
straightened
out
and
tore
past
in
a
smother
of
dust
with
its
muffler
cut
out
and
the
exhaust
bellowing
like
a
lanyard
counted
four
figures
two
on
the
front
seat
two
in
the
tonneau
more
than
this
the
headlong
speed
and
the
failing
light
rendered
it
impossible
to
see
though
had
the
one
been
less
and
the
other
stronger
he
could
have
gained
little
more
information
from
inspection
of
those
four
shapes
shrouded
in
dust
coats
and
masked
with
goggles
watching
its
rear
light
dwindle
he
fancied
that
the
grey
shadow
was
slowing
down
but
one
could
not
be
sure
about
that
there
is
something
wrong
monsieur
the
man
leon
was
at
his
elbow
lanyard
replied
with
the
curt
nod
of
a
disgruntled
motorist
something
jules
can
tell
you
he
said
shortly
meanwhile
mademoiselle
delorme
and
i
have
decided
not
to
wait
got
no
time
to
spare
we
will
take
your
car
and
go
on
but
monsieur
i
leon
began
to
expostulate
the
icy
accents
of
liane
delorme
cut
it
well
leon
what
is
your
objection
objection
madame
the
fellow
faltered
pardon
but
it
is
not
for
me
to
object
i
i
was
merely
startled
then
get
over
that
at
once
he
was
advised
and
bring
my
jewelcase
marthe
will
point
it
out
to
you
to
the
yes
madame
immediately
also
the
if
you
please
assuredly
monsieur
leon
departed
hastily
for
the
limousine
where
marthe
joined
him
while
lanyard
and
liane
delorme
proceeded
to
the
touring
car
but
what
on
earth
do
you
want
with
that
hamper
monsieur
hush
little
sister
not
so
loud
brother
thinks
he
has
another
idea
then
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
interfere
staggering
under
its
weight
leon
shouldered
the
jewelcase
and
carried
it
to
the
touring
car
where
liane
superintended
its
disposal
in
the
tonneau
a
second
trip
less
laborious
brought
them
the
hamper
liane
uttered
perfunctory
thanks
and
called
to
jules
who
was
still
tinkering
at
the
limousine
engine
with
the
aid
of
an
electric
torch
come
jules
leave
leon
to
attend
to
what
is
required
there
very
good
madame
jules
strolled
over
to
the
touring
car
and
settled
down
at
the
wheel
liane
delorme
had
the
seat
beside
him
lanyard
had
established
himself
in
a
debatable
space
in
the
tonneau
to
which
his
right
was
disputed
by
bags
and
boxes
of
every
shape
size
and
description
how
long
jules
will
leon
need
five
minutes
madame
if
he
takes
his
time
about
it
then
let
us
hasten
they
drew
away
from
the
limousine
so
quickly
that
in
thirty
seconds
its
headlights
were
all
that
marked
its
stand
lanyard
studied
the
phosphorescent
dial
of
his
wristwatch
from
first
to
last
the
transaction
had
consumed
little
more
than
three
minutes
liane
slewed
round
to
talk
over
the
back
of
the
seat
what
time
is
it
monsieur
ten
after
nine
in
an
hour
precisely
the
moon
will
rise
it
will
be
in
this
hour
of
darkness
then
a
bend
in
the
road
blotted
out
the
stationary
lights
of
the
limousine
there
was
no
visible
on
the
road
before
them
lanyard
touched
jules
on
the
shoulder
switch
off
your
lights
he
said
all
of
them
then
find
a
place
where
we
can
turn
off
and
wait
till
leon
and
marthe
pass
us
in
sudden
blindness
the
car
moved
on
slowly
groping
its
way
for
a
few
hundred
yards
then
jules
picked
out
the
mouth
of
a
narrow
lane
overshadowed
by
dense
foliage
ran
past
stopped
and
backed
into
it
in
four
minutes
by
lanyard
watch
the
pulse
of
the
limousine
began
to
beat
upon
the
stillness
of
that
sleepy
countryside
a
glare
like
naked
and
hungry
steel
leapt
quivering
past
the
bend
swept
in
a
wide
arc
as
the
lamps
themselves
became
visible
and
lay
horizontal
with
the
road
as
the
car
bored
past
evidently
leon
feels
quite
lost
without
us
lanyard
commented
shoot
jules
follow
his
rear
lamp
and
cut
out
your
muffler
can
you
manage
without
headlights
for
a
while
i
drove
an
ambulance
for
four
years
sir
the
car
swung
out
into
the
main
highway
far
ahead
the
red
sardonic
eye
in
the
rear
of
the
limousine
leered
as
if
mocking
their
hopes
of
keeping
it
in
sight
jules
however
proved
unresentful
and
he
was
marvellously
competent
to
anybody
who
ever
piloted
a
load
of
casualties
through
eighteen
inches
of
mud
dodging
shell
holes
and
shells
on
their
way
to
make
new
holes
in
a
black
rainstorm
at
midnight
this
sort
of
thing
jules
announced
a
hard
smooth
road
under
a
clear
sky
is
simple
pie
so
it
may
have
seemed
to
him
but
to
lanyard
and
liane
delorme
hurled
along
a
road
they
could
not
see
at
anywhere
from
forty
to
sixty
miles
an
hour
with
no
manner
of
guidance
other
than
an
elusive
which
was
forever
whisking
round
corners
and
remaining
invisible
till
jules
found
his
way
round
in
turn
by
instinct
or
second
sight
or
intuition
whatever
it
was
it
proved
unfailing
it
was
a
nervous
time
and
there
was
half
an
hour
of
it
they
were
swooping
down
a
long
grade
with
a
sharp
turn
at
the
bottom
as
they
knew
from
the
fact
that
the
red
eye
had
just
winked
out
somewhere
on
ahead
there
sounded
a
grinding
crash
the
noise
of
a
stout
fabric
rent
and
crushed
with
the
clash
and
clatter
of
shivered
glass
easy
lanyard
cautioned
and
ready
with
the
lights
both
warnings
were
superfluous
jules
had
already
disengaged
the
gears
gravity
carried
the
car
round
the
curve
slowly
smoothly
silently
under
constraint
of
its
brakes
it
slid
to
a
pause
on
a
steep
though
brief
descent
and
hung
there
like
an
animal
poised
to
spring
purring
softly
below
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
headlights
of
another
car
standing
at
some
distance
and
to
the
right
of
the
road
furnished
lurid
illumination
to
the
theatre
of
disaster
something
its
nature
just
then
mysterious
had
apparently
caused
leon
to
lose
control
of
the
heavy
car
so
that
it
had
skidded
into
a
ditch
and
capsized
four
men
crude
shapes
of
nightmare
in
enveloping
and
disfiguring
goggles
were
swarming
round
the
wreck
two
were
helping
the
driver
out
two
others
having
their
gallantry
in
performing
like
service
for
the
maid
rewarded
by
a
torrent
of
vituperative
denunciation
half
hysterical
and
wholly
infuriated
by
the
freedom
of
her
gestures
which
was
rivalled
only
by
that
of
her
language
the
dishevelled
storming
figure
of
marthe
was
manifestly
uninjured
and
in
another
moment
it
was
seen
as
leon
found
his
feet
and
limped
toward
the
others
that
he
had
suffered
only
slight
damage
at
the
worst
lanyard
drew
attention
to
a
dark
serpentine
line
that
lay
like
a
dead
snake
upon
the
lighted
surface
of
the
road
jules
grunted
in
token
of
comprehension
liane
delorme
breathlessly
demanded
what
is
it
an
old
trick
lanyard
explained
a
wire
cable
stretched
between
trees
diagonally
across
the
road
about
as
high
as
the
middle
of
the
windshield
the
impetus
of
the
limousine
broke
it
but
not
before
it
had
slewed
the
car
off
toward
the
ditch
wrenching
the
wheel
out
of
the
driver
hands
he
fondled
the
pistol
which
jules
had
handed
him
slipped
the
safety
catch
and
said
now
before
they
wake
up
jules
give
her
all
got
jules
released
the
brakes
and
as
the
car
gathered
way
noiselessly
slipped
the
gear
shift
into
the
fourth
speed
and
bore
heavily
on
the
accelerator
they
were
making
forty
miles
an
hour
when
they
struck
the
level
and
thundered
past
the
group
a
glimpse
of
startled
faces
the
scream
of
a
man
who
had
strayed
incautiously
into
the
roadway
and
stopped
there
apparently
petrified
by
the
peril
that
bore
down
upon
him
without
lights
or
any
other
warning
until
one
of
the
forward
fenders
struck
and
hurled
him
aside
like
a
straw
and
only
the
night
of
the
open
road
lay
before
them
jules
touched
the
headlight
switch
and
opened
the
exhaust
above
the
roaring
of
the
latter
lanyard
fancied
he
could
hear
a
faint
rattling
sound
he
looked
back
and
smiled
grimly
sharp
short
flames
of
orange
and
scarlet
were
stabbing
the
darkness
somebody
had
opened
fire
with
an
automatic
pistol
sheer
waste
of
ammunition
the
pace
waxed
terrific
on
a
road
like
so
many
roads
of
france
apparently
interminable
and
straight
on
either
hand
endless
ranks
of
poplars
rattled
like
loose
palings
of
some
tremendous
picket
fence
and
yet
long
before
the
road
turned
lanyard
staring
astern
as
he
knelt
on
the
rear
seat
with
arms
crossed
on
the
folded
top
saw
the
two
white
eyes
of
the
grey
car
swing
into
view
and
start
in
pursuit
quick
work
he
called
it
he
crawled
forward
and
communicated
his
news
shouting
to
make
himself
heard
do
ease
up
unless
you
have
to
he
counselled
do
think
we
dare
give
them
an
inch
back
at
his
post
of
observation
he
watched
hoping
against
hope
while
the
car
lunged
and
tore
like
a
mad
thing
through
the
night
snoring
up
grades
screaming
down
them
drumming
across
the
levels
clattering
wildly
through
villages
and
hamlets
while
the
moon
rose
and
gathered
strength
and
made
the
road
a
streaming
river
of
milk
and
ink
while
his
heart
sank
as
minute
succeeded
minute
mile
followed
mile
and
ever
the
lights
of
the
pursuing
car
lost
to
sight
from
time
to
time
reappeared
with
a
brighter
fiercer
glow
and
conviction
forced
itself
home
that
they
were
being
gradually
but
surely
overhauled
he
took
this
intelligence
to
the
ear
of
jules
the
chauffeur
answered
only
with
a
worried
shake
of
his
head
that
said
too
plainly
he
was
doing
his
best
extracting
every
ounce
of
power
from
the
engine
ill
luck
ambushed
them
in
the
streets
of
a
sizable
town
its
name
unknown
to
lanyard
where
another
car
driven
inexpertly
rolled
out
of
a
side
street
and
stalled
in
their
path
the
emergency
brake
saved
them
a
collision
but
there
were
not
six
inches
between
the
two
when
the
touring
car
stopped
dead
and
minutes
were
lost
before
the
other
got
under
way
and
they
were
able
to
proceed
less
than
three
hundred
yards
separated
pursued
and
pursuer
as
they
raced
out
through
open
fields
once
more
and
foot
by
foot
this
lead
was
being
inexorably
cut
down
in
the
seat
beside
the
driver
of
the
grey
car
a
man
rose
and
steadying
himself
by
holding
onto
the
windshield
poured
out
the
contents
of
an
automatic
presumably
hoping
to
puncture
the
tires
of
the
quarry
a
bullet
bored
a
neat
hole
through
the
windshield
between
the
heads
of
liane
delorme
and
jules
the
woman
slipped
down
upon
the
floor
and
jules
crouched
over
the
wheel
lanyard
fingered
his
automatic
but
held
its
fire
against
a
moment
when
he
could
be
more
sure
of
his
arm
instead
he
turned
to
the
lunch
hamper
and
opened
it
provisioning
had
been
ample
for
a
party
thrice
their
number
in
the
bottom
of
the
basket
lay
six
pint
bottles
of
champagne
four
of
them
unopened
lanyard
took
them
to
the
rear
seat
and
found
the
grey
car
had
drawn
up
to
within
fifty
yards
of
its
prey
making
a
pace
better
than
seventy
miles
per
hour
it
would
not
dare
swerve
the
first
empty
bottle
broke
to
one
side
the
second
squarely
between
the
front
wheels
he
grasped
the
first
full
bottle
by
the
neck
and
felt
that
its
weight
promised
more
accuracy
but
ducked
before
attempting
to
throw
it
as
a
volley
of
shots
sought
to
discourage
him
at
the
first
lull
he
rose
and
cast
the
bottle
with
the
overhand
action
employed
in
grenade
throwing
it
crashed
fairly
beneath
the
nearer
forward
wheel
of
the
grey
car
but
without
effect
other
than
to
draw
another
volley
in
retaliation
this
he
risked
the
emergency
had
grown
too
desperate
for
more
paltering
the
lead
had
been
abridged
to
thirty
yards
in
two
minutes
more
it
would
be
nothing
the
fourth
bottle
went
wild
but
the
fifth
exploded
six
inches
in
front
of
the
offside
wheel
and
its
jagged
fragments
ripped
out
the
heart
of
the
tire
on
the
instant
of
the
accompanying
the
grey
car
shied
like
a
frightened
horse
and
swerved
off
the
road
hurtling
headlong
into
a
clump
of
trees
the
subsequent
crash
was
like
the
detonation
of
a
great
bomb
deep
shadows
masked
that
tragedy
beneath
the
trees
lanyard
saw
the
beam
of
the
headlights
lift
and
drill
perpendicularly
into
the
zenith
before
it
was
blacked
out
he
turned
and
yelled
in
the
ear
of
jules
slow
down
take
your
time
they
quit
liane
delorme
rose
from
her
cramped
position
on
the
floor
and
stared
incredulously
back
along
the
empty
moonlit
road
what
has
become
of
them
lanyard
offered
a
vague
tried
to
climb
a
tree
he
replied
wearily
and
dropping
back
on
the
rear
seat
began
to
worry
the
cork
out
of
the
last
pint
bottle
of
champagne
he
reckoned
he
had
earned
a
drink
if
anybody
ever
had
xx
the
sybarites
without
disclaiming
any
credit
that
was
rightly
his
due
for
making
the
performance
possible
lanyard
felt
obliged
to
concede
that
delorme
confidence
had
been
well
reposed
in
the
ability
of
jules
to
drive
by
the
clock
for
when
the
touring
car
made
on
a
quayside
of
cherbourg
avant
port
what
was
for
its
passengers
its
last
stop
of
the
night
the
hour
of
eight
bells
was
being
sounded
aboard
the
countless
vessels
that
shouldered
one
another
in
the
twin
basins
of
the
commercial
harbour
or
rode
at
anchor
between
its
granite
jetties
and
the
distant
bulwark
of
the
digue
nor
was
jules
disposed
to
deny
himself
applause
receiving
none
immediately
when
he
got
down
from
his
seat
and
indulged
in
one
luxurious
stretch
i
disseminate
the
information
to
the
terrestrial
universe
he
volunteered
that
was
travelling
and
now
that
you
have
done
so
liane
delorme
suggested
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
let
the
stewards
know
we
are
waiting
if
the
grin
was
impudent
the
salute
she
got
in
acknowledgment
was
perfection
jules
faced
about
like
a
military
automaton
strode
off
briskly
stopped
at
some
distance
to
light
a
cigarette
and
in
effect
faded
out
with
the
flame
of
the
match
lanyard
did
try
to
keep
track
of
his
going
committed
as
he
stood
to
follow
the
lead
of
liane
delorme
to
the
end
of
this
chapter
of
intrigue
and
with
his
mind
at
ease
as
to
monsieur
dupont
for
the
time
being
at
least
he
was
largely
indifferent
to
intervening
developments
he
had
asked
no
questions
of
liane
and
his
knowledge
of
cherbourg
was
limited
to
a
memory
of
passing
through
the
place
as
a
boy
with
a
criminal
as
guide
and
police
at
their
heels
but
assuming
that
liane
had
booked
passages
for
new
york
by
a
cunarder
a
white
star
or
american
line
boat
all
three
touched
regularly
at
cherbourg
west
bound
from
southampton
he
expected
presently
to
go
aboard
a
tender
and
be
ferried
out
to
one
of
the
steamers
whose
riding
lights
were
to
be
seen
in
the
roadstead
meanwhile
he
was
lazily
content
mellow
voices
of
bell
metal
swelled
and
died
on
the
midnight
air
while
lounging
against
the
motor
car
with
liane
at
his
side
registering
more
impatience
than
he
thought
the
occasion
called
for
lanyard
listened
stared
wondered
the
breath
of
the
sea
sweet
in
his
nostrils
its
flavour
in
his
throat
his
vision
lost
in
the
tangled
web
of
masts
and
cordage
and
funnels
that
stencilled
the
sky
the
witching
glamour
of
salt
water
binding
all
his
senses
with
its
spell
it
was
quiet
there
upon
the
quay
somewhere
a
winch
rattled
drowsily
and
weary
tackle
whined
more
near
at
hand
funnels
were
snoring
and
pumps
chugging
with
a
constant
monotonous
noise
of
splashing
on
the
landward
side
from
wine
shops
across
the
way
came
blurred
gusts
of
laughter
and
the
wailing
of
an
accordeon
the
footfalls
of
a
watchman
or
perhaps
a
sergent
de
ville
had
lonely
echoes
the
high
electric
arcs
were
motionless
and
the
shadows
cast
by
their
glare
lay
on
the
pave
as
if
painted
in
lampblack
dupont
the
road
to
paris
seemed
figments
of
some
dream
dreamed
long
ago
the
tip
of
a
pretty
slipper
tapping
restlessly
continued
to
betray
liane
temper
but
she
said
nothing
privately
lanyard
yawned
then
jules
tagged
by
three
men
with
the
fair
white
jackets
and
shuffling
gait
of
stewards
sauntered
into
view
from
behind
two
mountains
of
freight
and
announced
all
ready
madame
liane
nodded
curtly
lingered
to
watch
the
stewards
attack
the
jumble
of
luggage
saw
her
jewel
case
shouldered
and
followed
the
bearer
lanyard
at
her
elbow
jules
remaining
with
the
car
the
steward
trotted
through
winding
aisles
of
bales
and
crates
turned
a
corner
darted
up
a
gangplank
to
the
of
a
small
steam
vessel
so
excessively
neat
and
smart
with
shining
brightwork
that
lanyard
thought
it
one
uncommon
tender
indeed
and
surmised
a
martinet
in
command
it
seemed
curious
that
there
were
not
more
passengers
on
the
tender
deck
but
perhaps
he
and
liane
were
among
the
first
to
come
aboard
after
all
they
were
not
to
sail
before
morning
according
to
the
women
he
apprehended
a
tedious
time
of
waiting
before
he
gained
his
berth
he
noticed
too
a
life
ring
lettered
sybarite
and
thought
this
an
odd
name
for
a
vessel
of
commercial
utility
then
he
found
himself
descending
a
wide
companionway
to
one
of
the
handsomest
saloons
he
had
ever
entered
a
living
room
that
aside
from
its
concessions
to
marine
architecture
might
have
graced
a
residence
on
park
lane
or
on
fifth
avenue
in
the
sixties
lanyard
stopped
short
with
his
hand
on
the
mahogany
handrail
i
say
liane
have
we
stumbled
into
the
wrong
pew
wrong
pew
the
woman
subsided
gracefully
into
a
cushioned
crossed
her
knees
and
smiled
at
his
perplexity
but
i
do
not
know
what
is
that
pew
i
mean
to
say
this
is
no
tender
and
it
unquestionably
is
an
atlantic
liner
i
should
hope
not
did
i
promise
you
a
what
do
you
say
tender
or
atlantic
liner
but
no
i
do
not
think
i
told
you
what
sort
of
vessel
we
would
sail
upon
for
that
america
you
did
not
ask
true
little
sister
but
you
might
have
prepared
me
this
is
a
private
yacht
are
you
disappointed
i
wo
say
that
it
is
the
little
ship
of
a
dear
friend
monsieur
who
generously
permits
but
patience
very
soon
you
shall
know
to
himself
lanyard
commented
i
believe
it
well
a
door
had
opened
in
the
after
partition
two
men
had
entered
above
a
lank
body
clothed
in
the
white
tunic
and
trousers
of
a
ship
officer
he
recognised
the
tragicomic
mask
of
the
whitaker
monk
at
his
shoulder
shone
the
bland
intelligent
countenance
of
phinuit
who
seemed
much
at
home
in
the
blue
serge
and
white
flannels
of
the
average
amateur
yachtsman
from
this
last
lanyard
received
a
nod
while
monk
with
a
great
deal
of
empressement
proceeded
directly
to
liane
delorme
and
bowed
low
over
the
hand
which
she
languidly
lifted
to
be
saluted
my
dear
friend
he
said
in
his
sonorous
voice
in
another
hour
i
should
have
begun
to
grow
anxious
about
you
you
would
have
had
good
reason
monsieur
it
is
not
two
hours
since
one
has
escaped
death
and
that
for
the
second
time
in
a
single
day
by
the
slenderest
margin
and
thanks
solely
to
this
gentleman
here
monk
consented
to
see
lanyard
and
immediately
offered
him
a
profound
salute
which
was
punctiliously
returned
his
eyebrows
mounted
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
ah
that
good
monsieur
duchemin
but
no
liane
laughed
it
is
true
the
resemblance
is
striking
i
do
not
say
that
if
paul
would
consent
to
grow
a
beard
it
would
not
be
extraordinary
but
permit
me
captain
monk
to
present
my
brother
paul
delorme
your
brother
mademoiselle
the
educated
eyebrows
expressed
any
number
of
emotions
monk
hand
was
cordially
extended
but
i
am
enchanted
monsieur
delorme
to
welcome
on
board
the
sybarite
the
brother
of
your
charming
sister
lanyard
resigned
limp
fingers
to
his
clasp
and
most
of
you
i
sure
captain
monk
i
believe
i
understood
liane
to
say
captain
monk
the
captain
bowed
captain
whitaker
monk
another
bow
lanyard
looked
to
liane
forgive
me
if
i
seem
confused
but
i
thought
you
told
me
mister
whitaker
monk
had
sailed
for
america
a
week
ago
and
so
he
did
the
captain
agreed
blandly
while
liane
confirmed
his
statement
with
many
rapid
and
emphatic
nods
monk
the
owner
is
my
first
cousin
fortune
has
been
less
kind
to
me
in
a
worldly
way
consequently
you
see
in
me
merely
the
skipper
of
my
wealthy
yacht
and
your
two
names
are
the
same
yours
and
your
cousin
you
both
whitaker
monks
it
is
a
favourite
name
in
our
family
monsieur
lanyard
wagged
his
head
in
solemn
admiration
phinuit
had
come
to
his
side
and
was
offering
his
hand
in
turn
it
all
gospel
lanyard
he
declared
with
a
cheerful
informality
which
lanyard
found
more
engaging
than
monk
sometimes
laboured
mannerisms
he
captain
whitaker
monk
skipper
of
the
good
ship
sybarite
mister
whitaker
monk
owner
and
my
name
is
really
phinuit
and
i
secretary
to
monk
you
see
the
owner
got
a
hurry
call
from
new
york
last
week
and
sailed
from
southampton
leaving
us
to
bring
his
pretty
ship
safely
home
that
makes
it
all
so
clear
well
anyway
i
glad
to
meet
you
to
your
bare
face
i
heard
a
lot
about
you
and
if
it
matters
to
you
thought
a
lot
more
if
it
comes
to
that
phinuit
i
have
devoted
some
thought
to
you
oh
daresay
and
now
if
mademoiselle
is
agreeable
suppose
we
adjourn
to
the
skipper
quarters
where
we
can
improve
one
acquaintance
without
some
snooping
steward
getting
an
unwelcome
earful
we
need
to
know
many
things
you
alone
can
tell
us
and
i
wager
you
could
do
with
a
drink
what
but
i
assure
you
monsieur
i
find
your
reception
sufficiently
refreshing
well
said
phinuit
momentarily
but
very
slightly
discountenanced
you
been
uncommon
damn
useful
you
know
i
mean
according
to
mademoiselle
useful
lanyard
enquired
politely
he
calls
it
that
liane
delorme
exclaimed
when
i
tell
him
you
have
saved
my
life
she
swept
indignantly
through
the
door
by
which
monk
and
phinuit
had
come
to
greet
them
two
ceremonious
bows
induced
lanyard
to
follow
her
monk
and
phinuit
brought
up
the
rear
yes
the
woman
pursued
twice
he
has
saved
it
in
the
same
place
phinuit
enquired
innocently
shutting
the
door
but
no
once
in
my
home
in
paris
this
morning
and
again
on
the
road
to
cherbourg
the
last
time
he
saved
his
life
too
and
jules
it
was
nothing
said
the
modest
hero
it
was
nothing
liane
echoed
tragically
you
save
my
life
twice
and
he
calls
it
and
you
call
it
my
god
i
tell
you
i
find
this
english
a
funny
language
but
if
you
will
tell
us
about
it
monk
suggested
placing
a
chair
for
her
at
one
end
of
a
small
table
on
which
was
spread
an
appetising
cold
supper
lanyard
remarked
that
there
were
places
laid
for
four
he
had
been
expected
then
or
had
the
fourth
place
been
meant
for
jules
one
inclined
to
credit
the
first
theory
it
seemed
highly
probable
that
liane
should
have
telegraphed
her
intentions
before
leaving
paris
indeed
there
was
every
evidence
that
she
had
neither
monk
nor
phinuit
had
betrayed
the
least
surprise
on
seeing
lanyard
and
phinuit
had
not
even
troubled
to
recognise
the
fiction
which
liane
had
uttered
in
accounting
for
him
it
was
very
much
as
if
he
had
said
that
brother
stuff
is
all
very
well
for
the
authorities
for
entry
in
the
ship
papers
if
necessary
but
it
wasted
between
ourselves
we
understand
one
another
so
let
get
down
to
brass
tacks
an
encouraging
symptom
though
one
had
already
used
the
better
word
refreshing
spacious
furnished
in
a
way
of
rich
sobriety
tasteful
in
every
appointment
the
captain
quarters
were
quite
as
sybaritic
as
the
saloon
of
the
sybarite
a
bedroom
and
private
bath
adjoined
and
the
open
door
enabled
one
to
perceive
that
this
rude
old
sea
dog
slept
in
a
real
bed
of
massive
brass
his
or
private
office
had
a
studious
atmosphere
its
were
stocked
with
handsome
bindings
the
panels
were
like
those
in
the
saloon
from
the
hands
of
modern
masters
lanyard
knew
good
painting
when
he
saw
it
the
captain
desk
was
a
substantial
affair
in
mahogany
most
of
the
chairs
were
of
the
overstuffed
lounge
sort
the
rug
was
a
persian
of
rare
lustre
monk
was
following
with
a
twinkle
the
journeys
of
lanyard
observant
eye
do
myself
pretty
well
do
you
think
he
observed
quietly
in
a
break
in
liane
dramatic
narrative
perforce
the
lady
must
now
and
again
pause
for
breath
lanyard
smiled
in
return
i
ca
see
you
much
to
complain
of
the
captain
nodded
but
permitted
a
shade
of
gravity
to
become
visible
in
his
expression
he
sighed
a
philosophic
sigh
but
man
is
never
satisfied
liane
had
got
her
second
wind
and
was
playing
variations
on
the
theme
of
the
famous
six
bottles
of
champagne
lanyard
lounged
in
his
easy
chair
and
let
his
bored
thoughts
wander
he
was
weary
of
being
talked
about
wanted
one
thing
only
fulfillment
of
the
promise
that
had
been
implicit
in
phinuit
manner
he
was
aware
of
phinuit
sympathetic
eye
the
woman
sent
the
grey
car
crashing
again
into
the
tree
repeated
lanyard
quaint
report
of
the
business
and
launched
into
a
vein
of
panegyric
regard
him
then
sitting
there
making
nothing
of
it
all
sheer
swank
phinuit
commented
he
just
letting
on
privately
he
thinks
he
a
heluva
fellow
do
you
lanyard
but
naturally
lanyard
gave
phinuit
a
grateful
look
that
is
understood
but
what
really
interests
me
at
present
is
the
question
who
is
dupont
and
why
if
you
asking
me
monk
replied
i
say
going
on
story
monsieur
dupont
is
by
now
a
ghost
one
would
be
glad
to
be
sure
of
that
lanyard
murmured
by
all
accounts
said
phinuit
he
takes
a
deal
of
killing
but
all
this
begs
my
question
lanyard
objected
who
is
dupont
and
why
i
think
i
can
answer
that
question
monsieur
this
was
liane
delorme
but
first
i
would
ask
captain
monk
to
set
guards
to
see
that
nobody
comes
aboard
this
ship
before
she
sails
pity
you
did
think
of
that
sooner
phinuit
observed
in
friendly
sarcasm
better
late
than
never
of
course
but
still
the
woman
appealed
to
monk
directly
since
he
did
not
move
but
i
assure
you
monsieur
i
am
afraid
i
am
terrified
of
that
one
i
shall
not
sleep
until
i
am
sure
he
has
not
succeeded
in
smuggling
himself
on
board
be
tranquil
mademoiselle
monk
begged
what
you
ask
is
already
done
i
gave
the
orders
you
ask
as
soon
as
i
received
your
telegram
this
morning
you
need
not
fear
that
even
a
rat
has
found
his
way
aboard
since
then
or
can
before
we
sail
without
my
knowledge
thank
god
liane
breathed
and
instantly
found
a
new
question
to
fret
about
but
your
men
captain
monk
your
officers
and
crew
can
you
be
sure
of
them
absolutely
you
have
signed
on
any
new
men
here
in
cherbourg
lanyard
asked
monk
worked
his
eyebrows
to
signify
that
the
question
was
ridiculous
no
such
fool
thanks
he
added
yet
they
may
have
been
corrupted
while
here
in
port
liane
insisted
no
fear
that
is
what
i
would
have
said
of
my
maid
and
footman
hours
ago
yet
i
now
know
better
i
tell
you
only
what
i
know
mademoiselle
if
any
of
my
officers
and
crew
have
been
tampered
with
i
do
know
anything
about
it
and
and
wo
until
the
truth
comes
out
and
you
sit
there
calmly
to
tell
me
that
liane
rolled
her
lovely
eyes
in
appeal
to
the
deck
beams
overhead
but
you
are
impossible
but
my
dear
lady
monk
protested
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
go
into
hysterics
if
you
think
it
will
do
any
good
as
it
happens
i
do
i
have
been
idle
or
fatuous
in
that
matter
i
have
taken
every
possible
precaution
against
miscarriage
of
our
plans
if
anything
goes
wrong
now
it
ca
be
charged
to
my
discredit
it
will
be
an
act
of
god
phinuit
declared
one
of
the
unavoidable
risks
of
the
business
the
business
liane
echoed
with
scorn
i
assure
you
i
wish
i
were
well
out
of
business
and
so
say
we
all
of
us
phinuit
assured
her
patiently
and
monk
intoned
a
fervent
amen
but
who
is
dupont
lanyard
reiterated
stubbornly
an
apache
monsieur
liane
responded
sulkily
a
leader
of
apaches
thank
you
for
nothing
patience
i
am
telling
you
all
i
know
i
recognised
him
this
morning
when
you
were
struggling
with
him
his
name
is
popinot
ah
why
do
you
say
monsieur
there
was
a
popinot
in
paris
in
my
day
they
nicknamed
him
the
prince
of
the
apaches
but
he
was
an
older
man
and
died
by
the
guillotine
this
popinot
who
calls
himself
dupont
then
must
be
his
son
that
is
true
monsieur
well
then
if
he
has
inherited
his
father
power
it
is
not
so
bad
as
all
that
i
have
heard
that
the
elder
popinot
was
a
true
prince
in
his
way
i
mean
as
to
his
power
with
the
apaches
his
son
is
hardly
that
he
has
a
following
but
new
powers
were
established
with
his
father
death
and
they
remain
stronger
than
he
all
of
which
brings
us
to
the
second
part
of
my
question
liane
why
dupont
liane
shrugged
and
studied
her
bedizened
fingers
the
heavy
black
brows
circumflexed
monk
eyes
and
he
drew
down
the
corners
of
his
wide
mouth
phinuit
fixed
an
amused
gaze
on
a
distant
corner
of
the
room
and
chewed
his
cigar
why
did
dupont
or
popinot
lanyard
persisted
murder
de
lorgnes
why
did
he
try
to
murder
mademoiselle
delorme
why
did
he
seek
to
prevent
our
reaching
cherbourg
give
you
three
guesses
phinuit
offered
amiably
but
i
warn
you
if
you
use
more
than
one
you
forfeit
my
respect
forever
and
just
to
show
what
a
good
sport
i
am
i
ask
you
a
few
leading
questions
why
did
popinot
pull
off
that
little
affair
at
why
did
he
try
to
put
you
out
of
his
way
a
few
days
later
because
he
wanted
to
steal
the
jewels
of
madame
de
montalais
naturally
i
knew
you
guess
it
you
admit
then
you
have
the
jewels
why
not
phinuit
enquired
coolly
we
took
trouble
enough
to
get
them
do
you
think
you
taking
trouble
enough
to
get
them
away
from
us
are
you
you
do
want
us
to
think
you
so
stupid
as
to
be
wasting
your
time
do
you
his
imperturbable
effrontery
was
so
amusing
that
lanyard
laughed
outright
then
turning
to
liane
he
offered
her
a
grateful
inclination
of
the
head
mademoiselle
you
have
kept
your
promise
many
thanks
hello
cried
phinuit
what
promise
monsieur
lanyard
desired
a
favour
of
me
liane
explained
her
good
humour
restored
in
return
for
saving
me
from
assassination
by
popinot
this
morning
he
begged
me
to
help
him
find
the
jewels
of
madame
de
montalais
it
appears
that
he
or
andre
duchemin
is
accused
of
having
stolen
those
jewels
so
it
becomes
a
point
of
honour
with
him
to
find
and
restore
them
to
madame
de
montalais
he
told
you
that
monk
queried
studiously
eliminating
from
his
tone
the
jeer
implied
by
the
words
alone
but
surely
and
what
could
i
do
he
spoke
so
earnestly
i
was
touched
regard
moreover
how
deeply
i
am
indebted
to
him
so
i
promised
i
would
do
my
best
et
voila
i
have
brought
him
to
the
jewels
the
rest
is
how
do
you
say
up
to
him
are
you
satisfied
with
the
way
i
keep
my
word
monsieur
it
hard
to
see
how
he
can
have
any
kick
coming
phinuit
commented
with
some
acidity
lanyard
addressed
himself
to
liane
do
i
understand
the
jewels
are
on
this
vessel
in
this
room
lanyard
sat
up
and
took
intelligent
notice
of
the
room
phinuit
chuckled
and
consulted
monk
in
the
tone
of
one
reasonable
man
to
his
peer
i
say
skipper
do
you
think
we
ought
to
be
liberal
with
monsieur
lanyard
he
an
awfully
good
sort
and
all
the
services
he
has
done
us
monk
set
the
eyebrows
to
consider
the
proposition
i
am
emphatically
of
your
mind
phin
he
pronounced
at
length
oracular
it
plain
to
be
seen
he
wants
those
jewels
means
to
have
do
you
know
any
way
we
can
keep
them
from
him
monk
moved
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
none
then
you
agree
with
me
it
would
save
us
all
a
heap
of
trouble
to
let
him
have
them
without
any
more
stalling
by
way
of
answer
monk
bent
over
and
quietly
opened
a
false
door
made
to
resemble
the
fronts
of
three
drawers
in
a
pedestal
of
his
desk
lanyard
could
see
the
face
of
the
safe
but
he
could
hear
the
spinning
of
the
combination
manipulated
by
monk
long
and
bony
fingers
and
presently
he
saw
monk
straighten
up
with
a
sizable
steel
in
his
hands
place
this
upon
the
desk
and
unlock
it
with
a
key
on
his
pocket
ring
there
he
announced
with
an
easy
gesture
lanyard
rose
and
stood
over
the
desk
investigating
the
contents
of
the
the
collection
of
magnificent
stones
seemed
to
tally
accurately
with
his
mental
memoranda
of
the
descriptions
furnished
by
eve
de
montalais
this
seems
to
be
right
he
said
quietly
and
closed
the
box
the
automatic
lock
snapped
fast
now
what
do
you
say
brother
dear
your
debt
to
me
is
fully
discharged
liane
but
messieurs
one
question
knowing
i
am
determined
to
restore
these
jewels
to
their
owner
why
this
open
handedness
cards
on
the
table
said
phinuit
it
the
only
way
to
deal
with
the
likes
of
you
in
other
words
monk
interpreted
you
have
under
your
hand
proof
of
our
bona
fides
and
what
is
to
prevent
me
from
going
ashore
with
these
at
once
nothing
said
phinuit
but
this
is
too
much
nothing
phinuit
elaborated
but
your
own
good
sense
ah
said
lanyard
ah
and
looked
from
face
to
face
monk
adjusted
his
eyebrows
to
an
angle
of
earnestness
and
sincerity
the
difficulty
is
lanyard
he
said
persuasively
they
have
cost
us
so
much
those
jewels
in
time
and
money
and
exertion
we
can
hardly
be
expected
to
sit
still
and
see
you
walk
off
with
them
and
say
never
a
word
in
protection
of
our
own
interests
therefore
i
must
warn
you
in
the
most
friendly
spirit
if
you
succeed
in
making
your
escape
from
the
sybarite
with
the
jewels
as
you
quite
possibly
may
it
will
be
my
duty
as
a
man
to
inform
the
police
that
andré
duchemin
is
at
large
with
his
loot
from
the
château
de
montalais
and
i
do
think
you
get
very
far
then
or
that
your
fantastic
story
about
meaning
to
return
them
would
gain
much
credence
d
see
but
distinctly
if
however
i
leave
the
jewels
and
lay
an
information
against
you
with
the
police
to
do
that
you
would
have
to
go
ashore
do
i
understand
i
am
to
consider
myself
your
prisoner
oh
dear
no
said
captain
monk
inexpressibly
pained
by
such
crudity
but
i
do
wish
you
consider
favourably
an
invitation
to
be
our
honoured
guest
on
the
voyage
to
new
york
you
wo
it
would
be
so
agreeable
of
you
sorry
i
must
decline
a
prior
engagement
but
you
see
lanyard
phinuit
urged
earnestly
we
taken
no
end
of
a
fancy
to
you
we
like
you
really
for
yourself
alone
and
with
that
feeling
the
outgrowth
of
our
very
abbreviated
acquaintance
think
what
a
friendship
might
come
of
a
real
opportunity
to
get
to
know
one
another
well
some
other
time
messieurs
but
please
phinuit
persisted
just
think
for
one
moment
and
do
forget
that
pistol
i
know
you
got
in
a
handy
pocket
we
all
unarmed
here
mademoiselle
delorme
the
skipper
and
i
we
ca
stop
your
going
if
you
insist
and
we
know
too
much
to
try
but
there
are
those
aboard
who
might
jules
for
instance
if
he
saw
you
making
a
getaway
and
knew
it
might
mean
a
term
in
a
french
prison
for
him
and
if
i
do
say
it
as
should
of
my
kid
brother
jules
is
a
dead
shot
then
there
are
others
there
surely
be
a
scrimmage
on
the
decks
and
how
could
we
explain
that
to
the
police
who
i
am
able
to
assure
you
from
personal
observation
are
within
hail
why
that
you
had
been
caught
trying
to
stow
away
with
your
loot
which
you
dropped
in
making
your
escape
d
see
how
bad
it
would
look
for
you
to
this
there
was
no
immediate
response
sitting
with
bowed
head
and
sombre
eyes
lanyard
thought
the
matter
over
a
little
indifferent
to
the
looks
of
triumph
being
exchanged
above
his
head
obviously
it
would
seem
you
have
not
gone
to
all
this
trouble
lured
me
aboard
this
yacht
merely
to
amuse
yourselves
at
my
expense
and
then
knock
me
on
the
head
absurd
liane
declared
indignantly
as
if
i
would
permit
such
a
thing
who
owe
you
so
much
or
look
at
it
this
way
monsieur
monk
put
in
with
a
courtly
gesture
when
one
has
an
adversary
whom
one
respects
one
wisely
prefers
to
have
him
where
one
can
watch
him
that
just
it
phinuit
amended
out
of
our
sight
you
be
on
our
nerves
forever
pulling
the
popinot
stunt
springing
some
dirty
surprise
on
us
but
here
as
our
guest
more
than
that
said
liane
with
her
most
killing
glance
for
lanyard
a
dear
friend
but
lanyard
was
not
to
be
put
off
by
fair
words
and
flattery
no
he
said
gravely
but
there
is
some
deeper
motive
he
sought
phinuit
eyes
and
phinuit
unexpectedly
gave
him
an
return
there
is
he
stated
frankly
then
why
not
tell
me
all
in
good
time
and
there
be
plenty
of
that
the
sybarite
is
no
mauretania
when
you
know
us
better
and
have
learned
to
like
us
i
make
no
promises
we
ask
none
only
your
pistol
well
monsieur
my
pistol
it
makes
our
association
seem
so
formal
do
you
think
so
constrained
come
lanyard
be
reasonable
what
is
a
pistol
between
friends
lanyard
shrugged
sighed
and
produced
the
weapon
really
he
said
handing
it
over
to
monk
how
could
anyone
resist
such
disarming
expressions
the
captain
thanked
him
solemnly
and
put
the
weapon
away
in
his
safe
together
with
the
steel
and
liane
delorme
personal
treasure
of
precious
stones
xxi
soundings
with
characteristic
abruptness
liane
delorme
announced
that
she
was
sleepy
it
had
been
for
her
a
most
fatiguing
day
captain
monk
rang
for
the
stewardess
and
gallantly
escorted
the
lady
to
her
door
lanyard
got
up
with
phinuit
to
bow
her
out
but
instead
of
following
her
suit
helped
himself
to
a
long
whiskey
and
soda
with
loving
deliberation
selected
trimmed
and
lighted
a
cigar
and
settled
down
into
his
chair
as
one
prepared
to
make
a
night
of
it
you
never
sleep
no
phinuit
enquired
in
a
spirit
of
civil
solicitude
desolated
if
i
discommode
you
monsieur
lanyard
replied
with
entire
amiability
but
not
not
at
least
until
i
know
those
jewels
have
no
more
chance
to
go
ashore
without
me
he
tasted
his
drink
with
open
relish
prime
scotch
he
judged
one
grows
momentarily
more
reconciled
to
the
prospect
of
a
long
voyage
make
the
most
of
it
phinuit
counselled
remember
our
next
port
of
call
is
the
great
american
desert
after
all
the
despised
camel
seems
to
have
had
the
right
idea
all
along
he
gaped
enormously
behind
a
superstitious
hand
monk
returning
published
an
elaborate
if
silent
superciliary
comment
on
the
tableau
he
has
no
faith
at
all
in
our
good
intentions
phinuit
explained
eyeing
lanyard
with
mild
reproach
it
most
discouraging
monsieur
suffers
from
insomnia
monk
asked
in
his
turn
under
certain
circumstances
ever
take
anything
for
it
it
would
require
nothing
less
than
possession
of
the
montalais
jewels
to
put
me
to
sleep
well
if
you
manage
to
lay
hands
on
them
without
our
consent
phinuit
promised
genially
you
be
put
to
sleep
all
right
but
do
let
me
keep
you
up
messieurs
captain
monk
consulted
the
chronometer
it
not
worth
while
turning
in
he
said
we
sail
soon
after
far
be
it
from
me
to
play
the
giddy
crab
then
phinuit
busied
himself
with
the
decanter
glasses
and
siphon
let
make
it
a
regular
party
we
have
all
to
sleep
it
off
in
if
i
try
to
hop
on
your
shoulder
and
sing

a
steward
and
have
him
lead
me
to
my
innocent
white
cot
but
take
a
fool
advice
lanyard
and
do
try
to
drink
the
skipper
under
the
table
on
the
word
of
one
who
tried
and
repented
it
can
not
be
done
but
it
is
i
who
would
go
under
the
table
lanyard
said
i
have
a
poor
head
for
whiskey
thanks
for
the
tip
pardon
i
mean
to
say
phinuit
explained
i
glad
to
have
another
weakness
of
yours
to
bear
in
mind
you
are
interested
in
the
weaknesses
of
others
monsieur
they
my
hobby
knowledge
monk
quoted
sententious
is
power
may
i
ask
what
other
entries
you
have
made
in
my
dossier
mr
phinuit
you
wo
get
shirty
but
surely
not
well
ca
be
positive
till
i
know
you
better
i
afraid
you
got
a
tendency
to
overestimate
the
gullibility
of
people
in
general
it
either
that
or
no
i
do
believe
intentionally
hypocritical
or
either
but
i
do
understand
remember
your
promise
but
you
seem
to
think
it
easy
to
put
it
over
on
us
mademoiselle
the
skipper
and
me
but
i
assure
you
i
have
never
had
any
such
thought
then
why
this
funny
story
of
yours
told
with
a
straight
face
too
about
wanting
to
get
hold
of
the
montalais
loot
simply
to
slip
it
back
to
its
owner
lanyard
felt
with
a
spasm
of
anger
constrict
his
throat
and
knew
that
the
restraint
he
imposed
upon
his
temper
was
betrayed
in
a
reddened
face
nevertheless
his
courteous
smile
persisted
his
polite
conversational
tone
was
unchanged
now
you
remind
me
of
something
i
presume
captain
monk
it
not
too
late
to
send
a
note
ashore
to
be
posted
oh
monk
eyebrows
protested
violently
a
note
on
plain
paper
in
a
plain
envelope
and
i
do
in
the
least
mind
your
reading
it
the
eyebrows
appealed
to
phinuit
and
that
worthy
ruled
under
those
conditions
i
do
see
we
can
possibly
object
monk
shrugged
his
brows
back
into
place
found
paper
of
the
sort
desired
even
went
so
far
as
to
dip
the
pen
for
lanyard
you
will
sit
at
my
desk
monsieur
many
thanks
under
no
more
heading
than
the
date
lanyard
wrote
dear
madame
de
montalais
i
have
not
forgotten
my
promise
but
my
days
have
been
full
since
i
left
the
château
and
even
now
i
must
be
brief
within
an
hour
i
sail
for
america
within
a
fortnight
you
may
look
for
telegraphic
advices
from
me
stating
that
your
jewels
are
in
my
possession
and
when
i
hope
to
be
able
to
restore
them
to
you
believe
me
dear
madame
devotedly
your
servant
michael
lanyard
monk
read
and
in
silence
passed
this
communication
over
to
phinuit
while
lanyard
addressed
the
envelope
quite
in
order
was
phinuit
verdict
accompanied
by
a
yawn
lanyard
folded
the
note
sealed
it
in
the
envelope
and
affixed
a
stamp
supplied
by
monk
who
meanwhile
rang
for
a
steward
take
this
ashore
and
post
it
at
once
he
told
the
man
who
answered
his
summons
but
seriously
lanyard
phinuit
protested
with
a
pained
expression
no
i
do
get
you
at
all
what
the
use
i
have
not
deceived
you
then
not
so
you
notice
it
alas
lanyard
affected
a
sigh
for
misspent
effort
oh
all
fair
outside
the
law
we
do
blame
you
for
trying
it
on
only
we
value
your
respect
too
much
to
let
you
go
on
thinking
we
have
fallen
for
that
hokum
you
see
monk
expounded
solemn
ass
that
he
was
beneath
his
thin
veneer
of
pretentiousness
when
we
know
how
the
british
government
kicked
you
out
of
its
secret
service
as
soon
as
it
had
no
further
use
for
you
we
can
understand
and
sympathise
with
your
natural
reaction
to
such
treatment
at
the
hands
of
society
but
one
did
know
you
knew
so
much
monsieur
le
capitaine
and
then
said
phinuit
when
we
know
you
steered
a
direct
course
from
london
for
the
château
de
montalais
and
made
yourself
persona
grata
there
oh
persona
very
much
grata
if
i
any
judge
you
can
hardly
ask
us
to
believe
you
did
mean
to
do
it
it
all
just
happened
so
monsieur
sees
too
clearly
why
if
it
comes
to
that
what
were
you
up
to
that
night
pussyfooting
about
the
château
at
two
in
the
morning
but
this
is
positively
uncanny
monsieur
knows
everything
why
should
i
know
about
that
vanity
rang
in
chuckle
who
you
think
laid
you
out
that
night
monsieur
is
not
telling
me
i
guess
i
owe
you
an
apology
phinuit
admitted
but
you
admit
that
in
our
situation
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
i
have
given
anything
if
we
been
able
to
get
by
any
other
way
but
you
such
an
unexpected
customer
well
when
i
felt
you
catch
hold
of
my
shirt
sleeve
that
night
i
thought
we
were
done
for
and
struck
out
blindly
it
was
a
lucky
blow
no
credit
to
me
hope
i
did
jar
you
too
much
no
said
lanyard
reflective
no
i
was
quite
all
right
in
the
morning
but
i
think
i
owe
you
one
afraid
you
do
and
it
going
to
be
my
duty
and
pleasure
to
cheat
you
out
of
your
revenge
if
fast
footwork
will
do
it
but
where
was
captain
monk
all
the
while
right
here
monk
answered
for
himself
sitting
tight
and
saying
nothing
and
duly
grateful
that
the
blue
prints
and
specifications
of
the
great
architect
did
design
me
for
work
then
it
was
jules
no
jules
does
know
enough
it
was
de
lorgnes
of
course
i
thought
you
guess
that
how
should
i
did
you
know
he
was
the
premier
cracksman
of
france
that
is
going
on
mademoiselle
delorme
account
of
him
she
says
there
was
never
anybody
like
that
poor
devil
for
putting
the
comether
on
a
safe
barring
yourself
monsieur
le
loup
seul
in
your
palmy
days
and
she
ought
to
know
those
two
have
been
working
together
since
the
lord
knows
when
a
sound
conservative
bird
de
lorgnes
very
discreet
even
when
drunk
which
was
too
often
but
this
is
most
interesting
how
did
you
get
separated
you
and
de
lorgnes
bad
luck
a
black
night
and
i
guess
there
no
more
question
about
this
your
friend
i
say
this
for
that
blighter
as
a
he
sure
did
give
service
phinuit
gave
his
whiskey
and
soda
a
reminiscent
grin
and
we
thought
we
were
being
bright
at
that
we
figured
every
move
to
the
third
decimal
point
the
only
uncertain
factor
in
our
calculations
as
we
thought
was
you
but
with
you
disposed
of
dead
to
the
world
and
madame
de
montalais
off
in
another
part
of
the
château
calling
the
servants
to
help
leaving
her
rooms
wide
open
to
us
the
job
did
take
five
minutes
the
way
de
lorgnes
made
that
safe
give
up
all
its
secrets
you
have
thought
he
had
raised
it
by
hand
we
stuffed
the
loot
into
a
grip
i
brought
for
the
purpose
and
beat
it
slipped
out
through
the
window
one
second
before
madame
de
montalais
came
back
with
that
doddering
footman
of
hers
but
they
never
even
looked
our
way
i
bet
they
never
knew
there
been
a
robbery
till
the
next
morning
do
i
lose
no
monsieur
you
are
quite
right
well
then
we
had
left
our
machine
we
had
driven
over
from
millau
just
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
standing
on
the
headed
for
nant
with
the
gears
meshed
in
third
so
she
would
start
without
a
sound
as
soon
as
we
released
the
emergency
brake
but
when
we
got
there
it
was
the
frantic
way
we
looked
for
it
made
me
think
of
you
pawing
that
table
for
your
candle
after
de
lorgnes
had
lifted
it
behind
your
back
and
then
of
a
sudden
they
jumped
us
popinot
and
his
crew
though
we
did
know
who
in
hell
it
might
have
been
the
château
people
in
fact
at
first
i
thought
it
was
i
lost
de
lorgnes
in
the
shuffle
immediately
never
did
know
what
had
become
of
him
till
we
got
liane
wire
this
morning
i
was
having
all
i
could
do
to
take
care
of
myself
thank
you
i
happened
to
be
carrying
the
grip
and
that
helped
a
bit
somebody
head
got
in
the
way
of
its
swings
and
i
guess
the
guy
has
forgotten
it
yet
then
i
slipped
through
their
fingers
i
never
tell
you
how
it
was
black
as
pitch
that
night
and
beat
it
blind
i
lost
my
flashlamp
and
had
no
more
idea
where
i
was
heading
than
an
owl
at
noon
of
a
sunny
day
but
they
the
popinot
outfit
seemed
to
be
able
to
see
in
the
dark
all
right
or
else
i
was
looney
with
fright
every
once
in
a
while
somebody
or
something
would
make
a
pass
at
me
in
the
night
and
i
duck
and
double
and
run
another
way
after
a
while
i
found
myself
climbing
a
steep
rocky
slope
and
guessed
it
must
be
the
cliff
behind
the
château
it
was
a
sort
of
path
which
i
could
see
only
guess
at
i
was
scared
stiff
but
they
were
still
after
me
or
i
thought
they
were
so
i
floundered
on
the
path
if
it
was
a
path
was
slimy
with
mud
and
about
every
third
step
i
slip
and
go
sprawling
i
ca
tell
you
how
many
times
i
felt
my
legs
shoot
out
into
nothing
and
dug
my
fingers
into
the
muck
or
broke
my
nails
on
rocks
and
caught
clumps
of
grass
with
my
teeth
to
keep
from
going
over
and
all
the
while
that
feeling
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
however
i
got
to
the
top
in
the
end
and
crawled
into
a
hollow
and
lay
down
behind
some
bushes
and
panted
as
if
my
heart
would
break
and
hoped
i
die
and
get
over
with
it
but
nobody
came
to
bother
me
so
i
got
up
when
the
first
streak
of
light
showed
in
the
sky
there
been
a
young
just
before
that
and
i
was
soaked
to
my
skin
and
struck
off
across
the
cause
for
de
lorgnes
and
i
had
fixed
that
if
anything
did
happen
to
separate
us
we
each
strike
for
lyons
and
the
one
who
got
there
first
would
wait
for
the
other
at
the
hôtel
terminus
but
before
i
could
do
that
i
had
to
find
a
railroad
and
i
did
dare
go
i
thought
because
the
chances
were
the
gendarmes
would
be
waiting
there
to
nab
the
first
bird
that
blew
in
all
covered
with
mud
and
carrying
a
bag
full
of
diamonds
i
managed
to
hold
onto
the
grip
through
it
all
you
see
but
before
that
day
was
done
i
wished
i
lost
it
the
damned
thing
got
heavier
and
heavier
till
it
must
have
weighed
a
gross
ton
it
galled
my
hands
and
rubbed
my
legs
till
they
were
sore
i
was
sore
all
over
anyway
inside
and
out
sometime
during
the
morning
i
climbed
one
of
those
bum
mounds
they
call
couronnes
to
see
if
i
could
sight
any
place
to
get
food
and
drink
preferably
drink
the
sun
had
dried
my
clothes
on
my
back
and
then
gone
on
to
make
it
a
good
job
by
soaking
up
all
the
moisture
in
my
system
i
figured
i
was
losing
eleven
pounds
an
hour
by
evaporation
alone
and
expected
to
arrive
wherever
i
did
arrive
if
i
ever
arrived
anywhere
looking
like
an
early
egyptian
prune
the
view
from
the
couronne
did
show
me
anything
i
wanted
to
see
only
a
number
of
men
in
the
distance
spread
out
over
the
face
of
the
causse
and
quartering
it
like
beagles
i
reckoned
i
knew
what
sort
of
game
they
were
hunting
and
slid
down
from
that
couronne
and
travelled
but
they
seen
me
and
somebody
sounded
the
it
was
grand
exercise
for
me
and
great
sport
for
them
when
i
could
totter
another
yard
i
fell
into
a
hole
into
the
ground
one
of
those
avens
and
crawled
into
a
sort
of
little
cave
and
lay
there
listening
to
the
suck
and
gurgle
of
millions
of
gallons
of
nice
cool
water
running
to
waste
under
my
feet
and
me
dying
the
death
of
a
dog
with
thirst
after
a
while
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
i
crawled
out
prepared
to
surrender
give
up
the
plunder
and
lick
the
boots
of
any
man
slip
me
a
cup
of
water
but
for
some
reason
they
given
up
the
chase
i
saw
no
more
of
them
whoever
they
were
and
a
little
later
i
found
a
peasant
hut
and
watered
myself
till
i
swelled
up
like
a
poisoned
pup
they
gave
me
a
there
and
something
to
eat
besides
and
put
me
on
my
way
to
millau
it
seemed
that
i
was
a
hundred
miles
from
anywhere
else
so
it
was
millau
for
mine
if
it
meant
a
life
sentence
in
a
french
prison
i
sneaked
into
the
town
after
dark
and
took
the
first
train
north
nobody
took
any
notice
of
me
i
could
see
the
use
of
going
all
round
robin
hood
barn
as
i
have
had
to
in
order
to
make
lyons
by
the
time
i
got
there
de
lorgnes
would
have
given
up
and
gone
on
to
paris
phinuit
finished
his
drink
i
say
it
was
a
gay
young
party
the
next
time
i
feel
the
call
to
crime
believe
me
i
going
out
and
snatch
nursing
bottles
from
kids
asleep
in
their
prams
but
they
be
asleep
monk
lifted
himself
by
sections
from
his
chair
it
was
a
good
yarn
first
time
i
heard
it
he
mused
aloud
but
now
i
notice
even
the
sybarite
is
getting
restless
in
the
course
of
phinuit
narrative
the
black
disks
of
night
framed
by
the
polished
brass
circles
of
the
stern
ports
had
faded
out
into
dusky
violet
then
into
a
lighter
lilac
finally
into
a
warm
yet
tender
blue
now
the
main
deck
overhead
was
a
for
thumps
and
rustle
of
many
hurried
feet
pilot
come
aboard
you
think
phinuit
enquired
and
added
as
monk
nodded
and
cast
about
for
the
visored
white
cap
of
his
office
know
pilots
were
such
early
birds
they
not
as
a
rule
but
if
you
treat
right
they
listen
to
reason
the
captain
graphically
rubbed
a
thumb
over
two
fingers
donned
his
cap
buttoned
up
his
tunic
and
strode
forth
with
an
impressive
gait
still
wakeful
phinuit
hinted
hopefully
and
shall
be
till
we
drop
the
pilot
thanks
if
i
had
seen
de
lorgnes
make
that
safe
sit
up
and
speak
and
know
you
were
his
master
i
be
tempted
to
bat
an
eye
or
two
however
phinuit
sighed
despondently
what
can
i
do
now
to
entertain
you
dear
sir
you
might
have
pity
on
my
benighted
curiosity
meaning
this
outfit
lanyard
assented
and
phinuit
deliberated
over
the
question
i
do
know
as
i
ought
in
the
absence
of
my
esteemed
associates
but
what
bothering
you
most
i
have
seen
something
of
the
world
monsieur
and
as
you
are
aware
not
a
little
of
the
underside
of
it
but
never
have
i
met
with
a
combination
of
such
peculiar
elements
as
this
possesses
regard
it
if
you
will
from
my
that
of
an
outsider
for
one
moment
phinuit
grinned
it
must
give
you
furiously
to
think
as
you
say
but
assuredly
take
for
example
yourself
a
man
of
unusual
intelligence
such
as
one
is
not
accustomed
to
find
lending
himself
to
the
schemes
of
ordinary
criminals
but
you
have
just
admitted
that
we
anything
but
ordinary
then
mademoiselle
delorme
one
knows
what
the
world
knows
of
her
that
she
has
for
many
years
meddled
with
high
affairs
that
she
had
been
for
many
years
more
a
sort
of
queen
of
the
of
paris
but
now
you
tell
me
she
has
stopped
to
profit
by
association
with
a
professional
burglar
profit
i
say
she
did
according
to
my
information
it
was
she
who
mapped
out
the
campaigns
for
de
lorgnes
she
was
and
he
merely
the
high
private
in
the
front
line
trenches
with
this
difference
that
in
this
instance
was
perfectly
willing
to
let
the
man
at
the
front
cop
all
the
glory
she
took
the
cash
and
let
the
credit
go
nor
heeded
rumblings
of
the
distant
drum
then
your
picturesque
confrère
captain
monk
and
the
singular
circumstance
that
he
owns
a
wealthy
cousin
of
the
same
name
and
this
beautiful
little
yacht
which
you
seem
so
free
to
utilize
for
the
furtherance
of
your
purposes
is
it
strange
then
that
one
curiosity
is
provoked
one
imagination
alternately
stimulated
and
baffled
no
i
suppose
not
phinuit
conceded
thoughtfully
still
it
far
simpler
than
you
think
one
has
found
that
true
of
most
mysteries
monsieur
i
do
mind
telling
you
all
i
feel
at
liberty
to
you
seem
to
have
a
pretty
good
line
on
mademoiselle
and
i
told
you
what
i
know
about
de
lorgnes
as
for
the
skipper
he
the
black
sheep
of
a
good
old
new
england
family
ran
away
to
sea
as
a
boy
and
was
disowned
and
grew
up
in
a
rough
school
it
would
take
all
night
to
name
half
the
jobs
had
a
hand
in
mostly
of
a
shady
nature
in
every
quarter
of
the
seven
seas
gun
running
pearl
poaching
what
not
even
a
little
slaving
i
suspect
in
his
early
days
he
a
pompous
old
bluff
in
repose
but
nobody
fool
and
a
bad
actor
when
his
mad
is
up
he
tells
me
he
fell
in
with
the
delorme
a
long
time
ago
while
acting
as
personal
escort
for
a
fugitive
south
american
potentate
who
crossed
the
borders
of
his
native
land
with
the
national
treasury
in
one
hand
and
his
other
in
monk
and
of
course
they
all
do
made
a
bee
line
for
paris
how
we
came
to
make
her
acquaintance
my
revered
employer
mister
monk
and
i
through
the
skipper
i
mean
phinuit
paused
to
consider
and
ended
with
a
whimsical
grimace
i
talking
too
much
but
it
does
matter
seein
it
you
strictly
between
ourselves
the
said
revered
employer
is
an
annointed
fraud
publicly
he
the
pillar
of
the
respectable
house
of
monk
privately
he
not
above
profiteering
foreclosing
the
mortgage
on
the
old
homestead
and
swearing
to
an
odoriferous
return
and
when
he
thinks
he
far
enough
away
from
home
my
land
how
that
little
man
do
carry
on
the
war
made
him
more
money
than
he
ever
thought
there
was
so
he
bought
this
yacht
and
started
on
the
grand
tour
but
never
got
any
farther
than
paris
naturally
his
first
stop
news
from
home
to
the
effect
that
somebody
was
threatening
to
do
him
out
of
a
few
nickels
sent
him
hightailing
back
to
put
a
stop
to
it
but
before
that
happened
he
wanted
to
see
life
with
a
large
l
and
cousin
whitaker
gave
him
a
good
start
by
introducing
him
to
little
ingénue
liane
and
then
she
put
the
smuggling
bee
in
his
bonnet
smuggling
lanyard
began
to
experience
glimpses
champagne
if
ever
all
the
truth
comes
out
i
fancy
it
will
transpire
that
liane
getting
a
from
some
vintner
you
see
friend
employer
was
displaying
a
cultivated
taste
in
vintage
champagnes
but
he
been
culpably
negligent
in
not
laying
down
a
large
stock
for
private
consumption
before
the
great
drought
set
in
the
delorme
found
that
out
then
that
his
ancestral
acres
bordered
on
long
island
sound
and
finally
that
the
sybarite
was
loafing
its
head
off
what
could
be
more
simple
she
suggested
than
that
monsieur
should
ballast
his
private
yacht
with
champagne
on
the
homeward
voyage
make
his
landfall
some
night
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
and
put
the
stuff
ashore
on
his
own
property
before
morning
did
he
fall
for
it
well
i
just
guess
he
did
this
is
all
most
interesting
monsieur
but
where
do
monk
and
i
come
in
oh
like
master
like
men
liane
was
too
wise
to
crab
her
act
by
proposing
anything
really
wicked
to
the
owner
and
wise
enough
to
know
nothing
could
shock
the
skipper
and
i
was
wise
enough
not
to
let
him
get
away
with
anything
unless
i
sat
in
on
the
deal
mademoiselle
played
all
her
cards
face
upwards
with
us
she
and
de
lorgnes
she
said
were
losing
money
by
disposing
of
their
loot
this
side
especially
with
european
currency
at
its
present
stage
of
depreciation
and
so
long
as
the
owner
was
doing
a
little
dirty
work
why
should
we
get
together
and
do
something
for
ourselves
on
the
side
if
champagne
could
be
so
easily
smuggled
into
the
states
why
not
diamonds
we
formed
a
company
on
the
spot
and
made
your
first
coup
at
the
château
de
montalais
not
the
first
but
the
biggest
de
lorgnes
mouth
had
been
watering
for
the
montalais
stuff
for
a
long
time
it
seems
my
boss
had
private
business
of
a
nature
we
wo
enter
into
in
london
and
gave
me
a
week
off
and
the
use
of
his
car
we
made
up
the
party
toured
down
the
rhone
valley
and
then
back
by
way
of
the
cévennes
just
to
get
the
lay
of
the
land
i
do
think
there
can
be
much
more
you
need
to
know
monsieur
is
too
modest
oh
about
me
why
i
guess
i
not
an
uncommon
phenomenon
of
the
times
i
was
a
good
citizen
before
the
war
and
everything
if
you
told
me
then
i
be
in
this
galley
i
probably
have
knocked
you
for
a
goal
i
had
a
flourishing
young
business
of
my
own
and
was
engaged
to
be
married
when
i
got
back
from
hell
over
here
i
found
my
girl
married
to
another
man
my
business
wrecked
what
was
left
of
it
crippled
by
extortionate
taxation
to
support
a
government
that
was
wasting
money
like
a
drunken
sailor
and
too
cynical
to
keep
its
solemn
promises
to
the
men
who
had
fought
for
it
i
had
to
take
a
job
as
secretary
to
a
man
i
could
respect
and
now
well
if
i
can
get
a
bit
of
my
own
back
by
defrauding
the
government
or
classing
myself
with
the
unorganised
leeches
on
society
nothing
i
know
is
going
to
stop
my
doing
it
phinuit
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
a
cold
pipe
at
which
he
had
been
sucking
for
some
time
rose
and
stretched
the
worst
of
it
is
he
said
in
a
serious
turn
i
mean
looking
at
the
thing
from
my
bourgeois
viewpoint
of
the
war
but
more
particularly
the
antics
of
the
various
governments
after
the
war
turned
out
several
million
of
men
in
my
frame
of
mind
the
world
over
we
went
into
the
thing
deluded
by
patriotic
bunk
and
the
promise
that
it
was
a
war
to
end
war
we
came
out
to
find
the
old
men
more
firmly
entrenched
in
the
seats
of
the
mighty
than
ever
and
stubbornly
bent
on
perpetuating
precisely
the
same
rotten
conditions
that
make
wars
inevitable
what
germany
did
to
the
treaty
that
guaranteed
neutrality
was
compared
to
what
the
governments
of
the
warring
nations
have
done
to
their
covenants
with
their
own
people
and
if
anybody
should
ask
you
you
can
safely
promise
them
that
several
million
soreheads
like
myself
are
what
the
politicians
call
menace
to
the
established
social
order
clear
daylight
filled
the
ports
the
traffic
on
deck
nearly
deserved
the
name
of
din
commands
and
calls
were
being
bawled
in
english
french
and
polyglot
profanity
a
was
rumbling
a
winch
clattering
a
clanking
alongside
a
tug
was
panting
hoarsely
the
engine
room
telegraph
jangled
furiously
the
fabric
of
the
sybarite
shuddered
and
gathered

we
off
yawned
phinuit
now
will
you
be
reasonable
and
go
to
bed
you
may
monsieur
said
lanyard
getting
up
for
my
part
i
shall
go
on
deck
if
you
do
mind
and
stop
there
till
the
pilot
leaves
us
fair
enough
but
one
moment
more
you
have
been
extraordinarily
frank
but
you
have
forgotten
one
element
to
me
of
some
importance
you
have
not
told
me
what
my
part
is
in
this
insane
adventure
that
not
my
business
to
tell
you
phinuit
replied
promptly
when
anything
as
important
as
that
comes
out
it
wo
be
through
my
babbling
anyhow
liane
may
have
changed
her
mind
since
last
reports
and
so
as
far
as
i
concerned
your
present
status
is
simply
that
of
her
pet
protégé
what
it
is
to
be
hereafter
you
learn
from
her
i
suppose
soon
enough
le
go
xxii
out
of
soundings
when
finally
lanyard
did
consent
to
seek
his
stateroom
with
the
pilot
dropped
and
the
sybarite
footing
it
featly
over
channel
waters
to
airs
piped
by
a
freshening
breeze
it
was
to
sleep
once
round
the
clock
and
something
more
for
it
was
nearly
six
in
the
afternoon
when
he
came
on
deck
again
the
quarterdeck
a
place
of
epicurean
ease
for
idle
passengers
was
deserted
but
for
a
couple
of
deckhands
engaged
in
furling
the
awning
lanyard
lounged
on
the
rail
revelling
in
a
sense
of
perfect
physical
refreshment
intensified
by
the
gracious
motion
of
the
vessel
the
friendly
rhythmic
chant
of
her
engines
the
sweeping
ocean
air
and
the
song
it
sang
in
the
rigging
the
vision
of
blue
seas
and
mirroring
in
a
myriad
facets
the
red
gold
of
the
westering
sun
and
the
lift
and
dip
of
a
far
horizon
whose
banks
of
violet
mist
were
the
fading
shores
of
france
in
these
circumstances
of
the
sea
he
loved
so
well
there
was
certain
anodyne
for
those
twinges
of
chagrin
which
he
must
suffer
when
reminded
of
the
sorry
figure
he
had
cut
overnight
still
there
were
compensations
of
a
more
material
nature
too
than
this
delight
which
he
had
of
being
once
again
at
sea
to
have
cheapened
himself
in
the
estimation
of
liane
delorme
and
phinuit
and
monk
was
really
to
his
advantage
for
to
persuade
an
adversary
to
one
is
to
make
him
almost
an
ally
also
lanyard
now
had
no
more
need
to
question
the
fate
of
the
montalais
jewels
no
more
blank
spaces
remained
to
be
filled
in
his
hypothetical
explanation
of
the
intrigues
which
had
enmeshed
the
château
de
montalais
its
lady
and
his
honour
he
knew
now
all
he
needed
to
know
he
could
put
his
hand
on
the
jewels
when
he
would
and
he
had
a
fair
fortnight
the
probable
duration
of
their
voyage
according
to
monk
in
which
to
revolve
plans
for
making
away
with
them
at
minimum
cost
to
himself
in
exertion
and
exposure
to
reprisals
plans
he
had
none
as
yet
he
would
begin
to
formulate
and
ponder
them
only
when
he
had
better
acquaintance
with
the
ship
and
her
company
and
had
learned
more
about
that
ambiguous
landfall
which
she
was
to
make
as
phinuit
had
put
it
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
not
that
he
made
the
mistake
of
despising
those
two
social
malcontents
phinuit
and
jules
that
rogue
adventurer
monk
that
grasping
courtesan
liane
delorme
individually
and
collectively
lanyard
accounted
that
quartet
uncommonly
clever
resourceful
audacious
unscrupulous
and
potentially
ruthless
utterly
callous
to
compunctions
when
their
interests
were
jeopardised
but
it
was
inconceivable
that
he
should
fail
to
outwit
and
frustrate
them
who
had
the
love
and
faith
of
eve
de
montalais
to
honour
cherish
and
requite
growing
insight
into
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
men
left
him
undismayed
he
perceived
the
steel
of
inflexible
purpose
beneath
the
windy
egotism
of
phinuit
the
pompous
histrionism
of
monk
he
knew
was
merely
a
shell
for
the
cold
calculating
undeviating
selfishness
that
too
frequently
comes
with
advancing
years
nevertheless
these
two
were
factors
whose
functionings
might
be
predicted
it
was
liane
delorme
who
provided
the
erratic
equation
her
mind
was
not
only
the
directing
intelligence
it
was
as
eccentric
as
quicksilver
infinitely
supple
and
corrupt
oriental
in
its
trickishness
and
impenetrability
already
it
had
conceived
some
project
involving
him
which
he
could
by
no
means
divine
or
even
guess
at
without
a
sense
of
wasting
time
trying
to
put
himself
in
her
place
lanyard
believed
that
he
would
never
have
neglected
the
opportunity
that
so
far
as
she
knew
had
been
hers
to
steal
away
from
paris
while
he
slept
and
leave
an
enemy
in
his
way
quite
as
dangerous
as
dupont
to
gnaw
his
nails
in
the
mortification
of
defeat
why
she
had
not
done
so
why
she
had
permitted
monk
and
phinuit
to
play
their
comedy
of
offering
him
the
jewels
passed
understanding
but
of
one
thing
lanyard
felt
reasonably
assured
now
that
she
had
him
to
all
intents
and
purposes
her
foiled
and
harmless
captive
aboard
the
sybarite
liane
would
not
keep
him
waiting
long
for
enlightenment
as
to
her
intentions
he
had
to
wait
however
that
night
and
the
next
three
before
the
woman
showed
herself
she
was
reported
ill
with
lanyard
thought
it
quite
likely
that
she
was
before
she
was
out
of
the
channel
the
sybarite
was
contesting
a
moderate
gale
from
the
southwest
on
the
other
hand
he
imagined
that
liane
might
sensibly
be
making
seasickness
an
excuse
to
get
thoroughly
rested
and
settled
in
her
mind
as
to
her
course
with
him
so
he
schooled
himself
to
be
patient
and
put
in
his
time
to
good
profit
taking
the
measures
of
his
shipmates
and
learning
his
way
about
ship
the
sybarite
seemed
unnecessarily
large
for
a
pleasure
boat
captain
monk
had
designated
her
a
ship
of
nine
hundred
tons
certainly
she
had
room
and
to
spare
on
deck
as
well
as
below
for
the
accommodation
of
many
guests
in
addition
to
the
crew
of
thirty
required
for
her
navigation
and
their
comfort
a
good
boat
very
steady
in
a
seaway
her
lines
were
nevertheless
fine
nothing
in
her
appearance
in
the
least
suggested
a
vessel
of
commercial
character
all
yacht
was
what
monk
called
her
the
first
mate
a
swain
was
a
sturdy
britisher
with
a
very
red
face
and
cool
blue
eyes
not
easily
impressed
if
lanyard
were
not
in
error
swain
entertained
a
private
opinion
of
the
lot
of
them
captain
monk
included
decidedly
uncomplimentary
but
he
was
a
civil
sort
though
deficient
in
sense
of
humour
and
inclined
to
be
a
bit
abrupt
in
a
preoccupied
fashion
collison
the
second
mate
was
another
kind
entirely
an
american
with
the
drawl
of
the
south
in
his
voice
a
dark
slender
man
with
eyes
quick
and
shrewd
his
manners
were
excellent
his
reserve
notable
though
he
seemed
to
derive
considerable
amusement
from
what
he
saw
of
the
passengers
going
on
his
habit
of
indulging
quiet
smiles
as
he
listened
to
their
communications
he
talked
very
little
and
played
an
excellent
game
of
poker
the
chief
engineer
was
a
mussey
stout
affable
and
cynic
a
heavy
drinker
untidy
about
his
person
and
exacting
about
his
a
veteran
of
his
trade
and
it
was
said
an
ancient
croney
of
monk
there
was
at
all
events
a
complete
understanding
evident
between
these
two
though
now
and
again
especially
at
table
when
monk
was
putting
on
something
more
than
his
customary
amount
of
side
lanyard
would
observe
mussey
eyes
fixed
in
contemplation
upon
his
superior
officer
with
a
look
in
them
that
wanted
reading
he
was
nobody
fool
certainly
not
monk
and
at
such
times
lanyard
would
have
given
more
than
a
penny
for
mussey
thoughts
existing
in
daily
contact
more
or
less
close
with
these
gentlemen
observing
them
as
they
went
to
and
fro
upon
their
lawful
occasions
lanyard
often
speculated
as
to
their
attitude
toward
this
lawless
errand
of
the
sybarite
of
which
they
could
hardly
be
unsuspicious
even
if
they
were
not
intimate
with
its
true
nature
and
remembering
what
penalties
attach
to
apprehension
in
the
act
of
smuggling
even
though
it
be
only
a
few
cases
of
champagne
he
thought
it
a
wild
risk
for
them
to
run
for
the
sake
of
their
daily
wage
something
to
this
effect
he
intimated
to
phinuit
do
worry
about
this
lot
that
one
replied
they
wise
birds
tough
as
they
make
ready
for
anything
down
to
the
last
the
skipper
is
a
man
to
take
fool
chances
and
when
he
recruited
this
crew
he
took
nobody
he
could
answer
for
they
more
than
well
paid
and
they
do
as
they
told
and
keep
their
traps
as
tight
as
clams
but
i
take
it
they
were
signed
on
before
this
present
voyage
was
thought
of
while
you
seem
to
imply
that
captain
monk
anticipated
having
to
depend
upon
these
good
fellows
in
unlawful
enterprises
maybe
he
did
at
that
phinuit
promptly
surmised
with
a
bland
eye
i
would
put
it
past
him
the
skipper
deep
and
i
never
tell
you
what
he
had
in
the
back
of
his
mind
when
he
let
friend
boss
persuade
him
to
take
command
of
a
pleasure
yacht
because
i
do
know
if
it
comes
to
that
the
owner
himself
never
confided
in
me
just
what
the
large
idea
was
in
buying
this
ark
for
a
plaything
yachting
for
fun
is
one
thing
running
a
young
floating
hotel
is
something
else
again
then
you
do
believe
the
grandiose
illusions
due
to
sudden
wealth
were
alone
responsible
i
do
know
that
little
man
has
a
mind
of
his
own
and
even
if
i
do
figure
on
his
payroll
as
confidential
secretary
he
does
tell
me
everything
he
knows
still
said
lanyard
drily
one
can
not
think
you
can
complain
that
he
has
hesitated
to
repose
his
trust
in
you
to
this
phinuit
made
no
reply
other
than
a
grunt
and
presently
lanyard
added
it
is
hardly
possible
eh
that
the
officers
and
crew
know
nothing
of
what
is
intended
with
all
the
champagne
you
have
recently
taken
aboard
they
no
fools
they
know
there
enough
of
the
stuff
on
board
to
do
a
cunarder
for
the
next
ten
years
and
they
know
too
there
no
lawful
way
of
getting
it
into
the
states
so
then
they
know
that
how
much
more
may
they
not
know
phinuit
turned
a
startled
face
to
him
what
that
he
demanded
sharply
may
they
not
have
exercised
their
wits
as
well
on
the
subject
of
your
secret
project
my
friend
what
are
you
getting
at
one
is
wondering
what
these
birds
as
tough
as
they
make
would
do
if
they
thought
you
were
as
you
say
getting
away
with
something
at
their
expense
as
well
as
the
owner
what
have
you
seen
or
heard
positively
nothing
this
is
merely
idle
speculation
well
phinuit
sighed
sibilantly
and
relaxed
let
hope
they
never
find
out
by
dawn
of
the
fourth
day
the
gale
had
spent
its
greatest
strength
what
was
left
of
it
subsided
steadily
till
as
the
seafaring
phrase
has
it
the
wind
went
down
with
the
sun
calm
ensued
lanyard
woke
up
the
next
morning
to
view
from
his
stateroom
deadlights
vistas
illimitable
of
flat
blue
flawed
by
hardly
a
wrinkle
only
by
watching
the
horizon
was
one
aware
of
the
slow
swell
of
the
sea
its
sole
perceptible
motion
and
all
day
long
the
sybarite
trudged
on
an
even
keel
with
only
the
wind
of
her
way
to
flutter
the
gay
awnings
of
the
quarterdeck
while
the
waters
sheared
by
her
stem
ran
down
her
sides
hissing
resentment
of
this
violation
of
their
absolute
tranquillity
also
the
sun
made
itself
felt
electric
fans
buzzed
everywhere
and
perspiring
in
utter
indolence
beneath
the
awnings
one
thought
in
sympathy
of
those
damned
souls
below
in
the
hell
of
the
at
luncheon
liane
delorme
appeared
in
a
summery
toilette
that
would
have
made
its
mark
on
the
beach
of
deauville
voluntary
or
enforced
her
period
of
retreat
had
done
her
good
making
every
allowance
for
the
aid
of
art
the
woman
looked
years
younger
than
when
lanyard
had
last
seen
her
nobody
would
ever
have
believed
her
a
day
older
than
no
one
that
is
to
say
who
had
not
watched
youth
ebb
from
her
face
and
leave
it
grey
and
waste
with
premature
winter
as
lanyard
had
that
morning
when
he
told
her
of
the
death
of
de
lorgnes
in
the
restaurant
of
the
buttes
montmartre
liane
herself
had
long
since
put
quite
out
of
mind
that
mauvais
quart
her
present
serenity
was
as
flawless
as
the
sea
though
unlike
the
sea
she
sparkled
she
was
as
gay
as
any
though
any
guilty
or
even
capable
of
a
scintilla
of
the
amusing
impropriety
of
her
badinage
would
have
merited
and
won
instant
expulsion
she
inaugurated
without
any
delay
a
campaign
of
conquest
extremely
diverting
to
observe
to
lanyard
it
seemed
that
her
methods
were
crude
and
obvious
enough
but
it
did
something
toward
mitigating
the
boredom
of
the
cruise
to
watch
them
work
out
as
they
seemed
to
invariably
with
entire
success
and
then
remark
the
insouciance
with
which
another
raw
scalp
dangling
from
her
belt
liane
would
address
herself
to
the
next
victim
swain
was
the
first
to
fall
mainly
because
he
happened
to
be
present
at
luncheon
it
being
collison
watch
on
the
bridge
under
the
warmth
of
violet
eyes
which
sought
his
constantly
drawn
by
what
one
was
left
to
infer
was
an
irresistible
attraction
his
reserve
melted
rapidly
his
remote
blue
stare
grew
infinitely
less
distant
and
though
he
blushed
furiously
at
some
of
the
more
audacious
of
sallies
he
was
quick
to
take
his
cue
when
she
expressed
curiosity
concerning
the
duties
of
the
officer
of
the
watch
and
coming
up
at
about
two
bells
for
a
turn
round
the
deck
and
a
few
breaths
of
fresh
air
before
dressing
for
dinner
lanyard
saw
them
on
the
bridge
their
heads
together
over
the
binnacle
to
the
open
disgust
of
the
man
at
the
wheel
liane
hailed
him
with
vivacious
gestures
commanded
his
attendance
as
a
brother
in
good
standing
one
could
hardly
do
less
than
humour
her
gracefully
so
lanyard
trotted
up
to
the
companion
ladder
and
liane
resting
a
hand
of
sisterly
affection
upon
his
arm
besought
him
to
make
clear
to
her
feminine
stupidity
swain
hopelessly
technical
explanation
of
the
compass
and
binnacle
obligingly
swain
repeated
his
lecture
and
lanyard
learning
for
himself
with
considerable
surprise
what
a
highly
complicated
instrument
of
precision
is
the
modern
compass
and
that
the
binnacle
has
essential
functions
entirely
aside
from
supporting
the
compass
and
housing
it
from
the
weather
could
hardly
blame
his
sister
for
being
confused
indeed
he
grew
so
interested
in
swain
exposition
of
deviation
and
variation
and
magnetic
attraction
and
the
various
devices
employed
to
counteract
these
influences
the
flinders
bars
the
spheres
and
the
system
of
adjustable
magnets
located
in
the
pedestal
of
the
binnacle
that
he
had
to
be
reminded
by
a
mild
exhibition
of
sisterly
temper
that
she
had
summoned
him
to
the
bridge
for
his
private
edification
so
then
he
said
after
due
show
of
contrition
it
is
like
this
the
magnetic
needle
is
susceptible
to
many
attractions
aside
from
that
of
the
pole
it
is
influenced
by
juxtaposition
to
other
pieces
or
masses
of
magnetized
metal
the
iron
ship
itself
for
example
is
one
great
magnet
then
there
are
dissociated
masses
of
iron
within
the
ship
each
possessing
an
individual
power
of
magnetism
sufficient
to
drag
the
needle
far
from
its
normal
fidelity
to
the
pole
so
the
scientific
mariner
when
he
installs
a
compass
on
board
his
ship
measures
these
several
forces
their
influence
upon
the
needle
and
installs
others
to
correct
them
on
the
principle
of
like
cures
like
let
us
put
it
in
a
figure
the
compass
is
the
husband
the
pole
the
wife
now
it
is
well
known
that
husbands
are
for
all
that
human
beings
able
to
perceive
attractions
in
persons
other
than
those
to
whom
they
are
married
the
wise
wife
then
studies
the
charms
of
mind
or
person
which
in
others
appeal
to
her
husband
and
makes
them
her
own
or
if
that
is
impossible
cultivates
other
qualities
quite
as
potent
to
distract
him
it
results
from
this
that
the
wise
wife
becomes
as
they
say
women
to
one
man
now
here
the
binnacle
represents
the
arts
by
which
that
wise
wife
the
pole
keeps
her
husband
true
by
surrounding
him
with
charms
and
qualities
these
magnets
sufficiently
powerful
to
counteract
the
attractions
of
others
do
i
make
myself
clear
but
perfectly
liane
nodded
emphatically
what
a
mind
to
have
in
the
family
she
appealed
to
swain
do
you
know
monsieur
it
happens
often
to
me
to
wonder
how
i
should
have
so
clever
a
brother
it
is
like
that
with
me
too
lanyard
insisted
warmly
he
made
an
early
excuse
to
get
away
having
something
new
to
think
about
mussey
put
up
a
stiffer
fight
than
swain
since
an
avowed
cynic
is
necessarily
a
man
who
knows
about
women
he
gave
liane
flatly
to
understand
that
he
saw
through
her
and
could
be
taken
in
by
all
her
blandishments
at
the
end
of
hours
however
the
conviction
seemed
somehow
to
have
insidiously
penetrated
that
only
a
man
of
his
ripe
wisdom
and
disillusionment
could
possibly
have
any
appeal
to
a
woman
like
liane
delorme
it
was
long
after
that
the
engine
room
was
illuminated
by
liane
pretty
ankles
and
mussey
was
beginning
to
comprehend
that
there
was
in
this
world
one
woman
at
least
who
could
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
machinery
collison
succumbed
without
a
struggle
true
to
the
tradition
of
southern
chivalry
he
ambled
up
to
the
block
laid
his
head
upon
it
and
asked
for
the
axe
nor
was
he
kept
long
waiting
on
the
seventh
day
the
course
pricked
on
the
chart
placed
the
sybarite
position
at
noon
as
approximately
in
contemplating
a
prospect
of
seven
days
more
of
such
emptiness
lanyard
very
soul
yawned
and
nothing
could
induce
captain
monk
to
hasten
the
passage
mussey
asserted
that
his
engines
could
at
a
pinch
deliver
twenty
knots
an
hour
yet
day
in
and
day
out
the
sybarite
poked
along
at
little
better
than
half
that
speed
it
was
no
secret
that
liane
delorme
panic
flight
from
popinot
had
hurried
the
yacht
out
of
cherbourg
harbour
four
days
earlier
than
her
proposed
sailing
date
whereas
the
sybarite
had
a
rendezvous
to
keep
with
her
owner
at
a
certain
hour
of
a
certain
night
an
appointment
carefully
calculated
with
consideration
for
the
phase
of
the
moon
and
the
height
of
the
tide
therefore
not
readily
to
be
altered
after
dinner
on
that
seventh
day
a
meal
much
too
long
drawn
out
for
lanyard
liking
and
marked
to
boot
by
the
consumption
of
much
too
much
champagne
he
left
the
main
saloon
the
arena
of
an
impromptu
poker
party
repaired
to
the
quarterdeck
and
finding
a
wicker
lounge
chair
by
the
taffrail
subsided
into
it
with
a
sigh
of
gratitude
for
this
fragrant
solitude
of
night
so
soothing
and
serene
the
sybarite
making
easy
way
through
a
slight
sea
with
what
wind
there
was
not
much
on
the
port
bow
rolled
but
slightly
and
her
deliberate
and
graceful
motion
as
she
swung
from
crest
to
crest
of
the
endless
swells
caused
the
stars
to
stream
above
her
a
boundless
river
of
broken
light
the
pulsing
of
the
engines
unhasting
unresting
ran
through
her
fabric
in
ceaseless
succession
of
gentle
tremors
while
the
rumble
of
their
revolutions
resembled
the
refrain
of
an
old
quiet
song
the
mechanism
of
the
patent
log
hummed
and
clicked
more
obtrusively
directly
underfoot
the
screw
churned
a
softly
clashing
wake
from
the
saloon
companionway
drifted
intermittently
a
confusion
of
voices
liane
light
laughter
muted
clatter
of
chips
now
and
then
the
sound
of
a
popping
cork
forward
the
ship
bell
sounded
two
double
strokes
then
a
single
followed
by
a
wail
in
minor
key
five
bells
and
all
well
and
of
a
sudden
lanyard
suffered
the
melancholy
oppression
of
knowing
his
littleness
of
body
and
soul
the
relative
insignificance
even
of
the
ship
that
impertinent
atom
of
human
organization
which
traversed
with
unabashed
effrontery
the
waters
of
the
ages
beneath
the
shining
constellations
of
eternity
in
profound
psychical
enervation
he
perceived
with
bitterness
and
despair
the
enormous
futility
of
all
things
mortal
the
hopelessness
of
effort
the
certain
black
defeat
that
waits
upon
even
what
men
term
success
he
felt
crushed
spiritually
invertebrate
destitute
of
object
in
existence
bereft
of
all
hope
what
mattered
it
whether
he
won
or
lost
in
this
stupid
contest
whose
prize
was
possession
of
a
few
trinkets
set
with
bits
of
glittering
stone
if
he
won
of
what
avail
what
could
it
profit
his
soul
to
make
good
a
vain
boast
to
eve
de
montalais
would
it
matter
to
her
what
success
or
failure
meant
to
him
lanyard
doubted
it
he
doubted
her
himself
all
things
within
the
compass
of
his
understanding
and
knew
appalling
glimpses
of
that
everlasting
truth
too
passionless
to
be
cynical
that
the
hopes
of
man
and
his
fears
his
loves
and
hates
his
strivings
and
passivity
are
all
one
in
the
measured
and
immutable
processes
of
time
the
pressure
of
a
hand
upon
his
own
roused
him
to
discover
the
liane
delorme
had
seated
herself
beside
him
in
a
chair
that
looked
the
other
way
so
that
her
face
was
not
far
from
his
and
he
could
scarcely
be
unaware
of
its
hinted
beauty
now
wan
and
glimmering
in
starlight
enigmatic
with
soft
close
shadows
i
must
have
been
dreaming
he
said
apologetic
you
startled
me
one
could
see
that
my
friend
the
woman
spoke
in
quiet
accents
and
let
her
hand
linger
upon
his
with
its
insistent
reminder
of
the
warm
living
presence
whose
rich
colouring
was
disguised
by
the
gloom
that
encompassed
both
four
strokes
in
duplicate
on
the
ship
bell
then
the
call
bells
and
lanyard
muttered
no
idea
it
was
so
late
a
slender
white
shape
collison
emerged
from
his
quarters
in
the
beneath
the
bridge
and
ran
up
the
ladder
to
relieve
swain
at
the
same
time
a
seaman
came
from
forward
and
ascended
by
the
other
ladder
later
swain
and
the
man
whose
trick
at
the
wheel
was
ended
left
the
bridge
the
latter
to
go
forward
to
his
rest
swain
to
turn
into
his
room
in
the
the
hot
glow
of
the
saloon
skylights
became
a
dim
refulgence
aside
from
which
and
its
glimmer
in
the
mouth
of
the
companionway
no
lights
were
visible
in
the
whole
length
of
the
ship
except
the
shuttered
window
of
swain
room
which
presently
was
darkened
and
odd
glimpses
of
the
binnacle
light
to
be
had
when
the
helmsman
shifted
his
stand
a
profound
hush
closed
down
upon
the
ship
whose
progress
across
the
face
of
the
waters
seemed
to
acquire
a
new
significance
of
stealth
so
that
the
two
seated
by
the
taffrail
above
the
throbbing
screws
and
rushing
torrent
of
the
wake
talked
in
lowered
accents
without
thinking
why
it
is
that
one
grows
bored
eh
cher
ami
perhaps
liane
or
perhaps
that
one
thought
are
constantly
with
one
heart
elsewhere
you
think
so
at
the
château
de
montalais
conceivably
it
amuses
you
then
to
shoot
arrows
into
the
air
but
naturally
i
seek
the
reason
when
i
see
you
distrait
and
am
conscious
of
your
neglect
i
think
it
is
for
me
to
complain
of
that
how
can
you
say
such
things
one
has
seen
what
one
has
seen
these
last
few
days
i
think
you
are
what
that
original
phinuit
would
call
fast
worker
liane
what
stupidity
if
i
seek
to
make
myself
liked
you
know
well
it
is
with
a
purpose
one
hardly
questions
that
you
judge
harshly
michael
lanyard
spent
a
look
of
astonishment
on
the
darkness
he
could
not
remember
that
liane
had
ever
before
called
him
by
that
name
do
i
sorry
his
tone
was
listless
but
does
it
matter
you
know
that
to
me
nothing
else
matters
lanyard
checked
off
on
his
fingers
swain
collison
mussey
who
next
why
not
i
as
well
as
another
do
you
imagine
for
an
instant
that
i
class
you
with
such
riffraff
why
if
you
really
want
to
know
what
i
think
liane
it
seems
to
me
that
all
men
in
your
sight
are
much
the
same
good
for
one
thing
only
to
be
used
to
serve
your
ends
and
who
am
i
that
you
should
hold
me
in
higher
rating
than
any
other
man
you
should
know
i
do
the
woman
breathed
so
low
he
barely
caught
the
words
and
uttered
an
involuntary
pardon
before
he
knew
he
had
understood
so
that
she
iterated
in
a
clearer
tone
of
protest
you
should
know
i
do
that
i
do
esteem
you
as
something
more
than
other
men
think
what
i
owe
to
you
michael
and
then
consider
this
that
of
all
men
whom
i
have
known
you
alone
have
never
asked
for
love
he
gave
a
quiet
laugh
there
is
too
much
humility
in
my
heart
no
she
said
in
a
dull
voice
but
you
despise
me
do
not
deny
it
she
shifted
impatiently
in
her
chair
i
know
what
i
know
i
am
no
fool
whatever
you
think
of
me
no
she
went
on
with
emotion
under
restraint
i
am
a
creature
of
fatality
me
i
can
not
hope
to
escape
my
fate
he
was
silent
a
little
in
perplexed
consideration
of
this
what
did
she
wish
him
to
believe
but
one
imagines
nobody
can
escape
his
fate
men
can
some
of
them
men
such
as
you
rare
as
you
are
know
how
to
cheat
destiny
but
women
never
it
is
the
fate
of
all
women
that
each
shall
some
time
love
some
man
to
desperation
and
be
despised
it
is
my
fate
to
have
learned
too
late
to
love
you
michael
ah
liane
liane
but
you
hold
me
in
too
much
contempt
to
be
willing
to
recognise
the
truth
on
the
contrary
i
admire
you
extremely
i
think
you
are
an
incomparable
actress
you
see
she
offered
a
despairing
gesture
to
the
stars
it
is
not
true
what
i
say
i
lay
bare
my
heart
to
him
and
he
tells
me
that
i
act
but
my
dear
girl
surely
you
do
not
expect
me
to
think
otherwise
i
was
a
fool
to
expect
anything
from
you
she
returned
bitterly
you
know
too
much
about
me
i
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
blame
you
since
i
am
what
i
am
what
the
life
you
saved
me
to
so
long
ago
has
made
me
why
should
you
believe
in
me
why
should
you
credit
the
sincerity
of
this
confession
which
costs
me
so
much
humiliation
that
would
be
too
good
for
me
too
much
to
ask
of
life
i
think
you
can
not
fairly
complain
of
life
liane
what
have
you
asked
of
it
that
you
have
failed
to
get
success
money
power
adulation
never
love
the
world
would
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
ah
love
of
a
sort
yes
the
love
that
is
the
desire
to
possess
and
that
possession
satisfies
have
you
asked
for
any
other
sort
i
ask
it
now
i
know
what
the
love
is
that
longs
to
give
to
give
and
give
again
asking
no
return
but
kindness
understanding
even
toleration
merely
it
is
such
love
as
this
i
bear
you
michael
but
you
do
not
believe
divided
between
annoyance
and
distaste
he
was
silent
and
all
at
once
she
threw
herself
half
across
the
joined
arms
of
their
chairs
catching
his
shoulders
with
her
hands
so
that
her
body
rested
on
his
bosom
and
its
scented
warmth
assailed
his
senses
with
the
seduction
whose
power
she
knew
so
well
ah
michael
my
michael
she
cried
if
you
but
knew
if
only
you
could
believe
it
is
so
real
to
me
so
true
so
overwhelming
the
greatest
thing
of
all
how
can
it
be
otherwise
to
you
no
do
not
think
i
complain
do
not
think
i
blame
you
or
have
room
in
my
heart
for
any
resentment
but
oh
my
dear
were
i
only
able
to
make
you
understand
think
what
life
could
be
to
us
to
you
and
me
what
could
it
withhold
that
we
desired
you
with
your
wit
your
strength
your
skill
your
poise
i
with
my
great
love
to
inspire
and
sustain
you
what
a
pair
we
should
make
what
happiness
would
be
ours
think
michael
think
i
have
thought
liane
he
returned
in
accents
as
kind
as
the
hands
that
held
her
i
have
thought
well
yes
she
lifted
her
face
so
near
that
their
breaths
mingled
and
he
was
conscious
of
the
allure
of
tremulous
and
parted
lips
you
have
thought
and
tell
me
your
thought
my
michael
why
i
think
two
things
said
lanyard
first
that
you
deserve
to
be
soundly
kissed
he
kissed
her
but
with
discretion
and
firmly
put
her
from
him
then
his
tone
took
on
a
note
of
earnestness
that
if
what
you
have
said
is
true
it
is
a
pity
and
i
am
sorry
liane
very
sorry
and
if
it
is
not
true
that
the
comedy
was
well
played
shall
we
let
it
rest
at
that
my
dear
half
lifting
her
he
helped
her
back
into
her
chair
and
as
she
turned
her
face
away
struggling
for
mastery
of
her
emotion
true
or
feigned
he
sat
back
found
his
cigarette
case
and
clipping
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
cast
about
for
a
match
he
had
none
in
his
pockets
but
knew
that
there
was
a
stand
on
one
of
the
wicker
tables
nearby
rising
he
found
it
and
as
he
struck
the
light
heard
a
sudden
soft
swish
of
draperies
as
the
woman
rose
moving
toward
the
saloon
companionway
she
passed
him
swiftly
without
a
word
her
head
bended
a
hand
pressing
a
handkerchief
to
her
lips
forgetful
he
followed
her
swaying
figure
with
puzzled
gaze
till
admonished
by
the
flame
that
crept
toward
his
fingertips
then
dropping
the
match
he
struck
another
and
put
it
to
his
cigarette
at
the
second
puff
he
heard
a
choking
gasp
and
looked
up
again
the
woman
stood
alone
en
silhouette
against
the
glow
of
the
companionway
her
arms
thrust
out
as
if
to
ward
off
some
threatened
danger
a
second
cry
broke
from
her
lips
shrill
with
terror
she
tottered
and
fell
as
dropping
his
cigarette
lanyard
ran
to
her
his
vision
dazzled
by
the
flame
of
the
match
he
sought
in
vain
for
any
cause
for
her
apparent
fright
for
all
he
could
see
the
deck
was
as
empty
as
he
had
presumed
it
to
be
all
through
their
conversation
he
found
her
in
a
faint
unmistakably
unaffected
footfalls
sounded
on
the
deck
as
he
knelt
making
superficial
examination
collison
had
heard
her
cries
and
witnessed
her
fall
from
the
bridge
and
was
coming
to
investigate
what
in
blazes
lanyard
replied
with
a
gesture
of
bewilderment
she
was
just
going
below
i
stopped
to
light
a
cigarette
saw
nothing
to
account
for
this
wait
i
fetch
water
he
darted
down
the
companionway
filled
a
glass
from
a
silver
thermos
carafe
and
hurried
back
as
he
arrived
at
the
top
of
steps
collison
announced
it
all
right
she
coming
to
supported
in
the
arms
of
the
second
mate
liane
was
beginning
to
breathe
deeply
and
looking
round
with
dazed
eyes
lanyard
dropped
on
a
knee
and
set
the
glass
to
her
lips
she
gulped
twice
mechanically
her
gaze
fixed
to
his
face
then
suddenly
memory
cleared
and
she
uttered
a
bubbling
gasp
of
returning
dread
popinot
she
cried
as
lanyard
hastily
took
the
glass
away
popinot
he
was
there
i
saw
him
standing
there
a
trembling
arm
indicated
the
starboard
deck
just
forward
of
the
companion
housing
but
of
course
when
lanyard
looked
there
was
no
one
there
if
there
had
ever
been
xxiii
the
cigarette
lanyard
found
himself
exchanging
looks
of
mystification
with
collison
and
heard
his
own
voice
make
the
flat
statement
but
there
is
nobody
collison
muttered
words
which
he
took
to
be
no
and
never
was
but
you
must
have
seen
him
from
the
bridge
lanyard
insisted
blankly
if
i
looked
around
as
soon
as
i
heard
her
call
out
collison
replied
but
i
did
see
anybody
only
mademoiselle
here
and
you
of
course
with
that
match
please
help
me
up
liane
delorme
asked
in
a
faint
voice
collison
lent
a
hand
in
the
support
and
shelter
of
lanyard
arm
the
body
quivered
like
that
of
a
frightened
child
i
must
go
to
my
stateroom
she
sighed
uncertainly
but
i
am
afraid
do
not
be
remember
collison
and
i
besides
you
know
there
was
nobody
the
assertion
seemed
to
exasperate
her
her
voice
discovered
new
strength
and
violence
but
i
am
telling
you
i
saw
that
assassin
she
shuddered
again
standing
there
in
the
shadow
glaring
at
me
as
if
i
had
surprised
him
and
he
did
not
know
what
next
to
do
i
think
he
must
have
been
spying
down
through
the
skylight
it
was
the
glow
from
it
that
showed
me
his
red
dirty
face
of
a
pig
you
came
aft
on
the
port
side
did
you
lanyard
enquired
of
the
second
mate
collison
nodded
running
he
said
could
imagine
what
was
up
it
is
easy
not
to
see
what
one
is
not
looking
for
lanyard
mused
staring
forward
along
the
starboard
side
if
a
man
had
dropped
flat
and
squirmed
along
until
in
the
shelter
of
the
ventilators
he
could
have
run
forward
bending
low
you
know
without
your
seeing
him
but
you
were
standing
here
to
starboard
i
tell
you
that
match
was
blinding
me
lanyard
affirmed
irritably
besides
i
was
looking
except
at
my
sister
wondering
what
was
the
matter
collison
started
excuse
me
he
said
reminded
if
all
right
i
ought
to
get
back
to
the
bridge
take
me
below
liane
begged
i
must
speak
with
captain
monk
monk
and
phinuit
were
taking
their
ease
plus
nightcaps
in
the
a
knock
brought
a
prompt
invitation
to
come
in
lanyard
thrust
the
door
open
and
curtly
addressed
monk
mademoiselle
delorme
wishes
to
see
you
the
eloquent
eyebrows
indicated
surprise
and
resignation
and
monk
got
up
and
inserted
himself
into
his
white
linen
tunic
phinuit
more
sensitive
to
the
accent
of
something
amiss
hurried
out
in
unceremonious
shirt
sleeves
what
up
he
demanded
looking
from
lanyard
grave
face
to
liane
face
of
pallor
and
distress
lanyard
informed
him
in
a
few
words
impossible
phinuit
commented
nonsense
monk
added
speaking
directly
to
liane
you
imagined
it
all
she
had
recovered
much
of
her
composure
enough
to
enable
her
to
shrug
her
disdain
of
such
stupidity
i
tell
you
only
what
my
two
eyes
saw
to
be
sure
monk
agreed
with
a
specious
air
of
being
wide
open
to
conviction
what
became
of
him
then
you
ask
me
that
knowing
that
in
stress
of
terror
i
fainted
the
eyebrows
achieved
an
effect
of
studied
weariness
and
you
saw
nobody
monsieur
and
collison
did
either
lanyard
shook
his
head
to
each
question
still
it
is
possible
monk
cut
him
short
impatiently
all
gammon
all
in
her
eye
no
man
bigger
than
a
cockroach
could
have
smuggled
himself
aboard
this
yacht
without
my
being
told
i
know
my
ship
i
know
my
men
i
know
what
talking
about
presently
liane
prophesied
darkly
you
may
be
talking
about
nothing
at
a
loss
monk
muttered
do
get
you
when
you
find
yourself
some
fine
morning
with
your
throat
cut
in
your
sleep
like
poor
de
lorgnes
or
garroted
as
i
might
have
been
i
not
going
to
lose
any
sleep
monk
began
lose
none
before
you
have
the
vessel
searched
liane
pleaded
with
a
change
of
tone
you
know
messieurs
i
am
not
a
woman
given
to
hallucinations
i
and
i
tell
you
while
that
assassin
is
at
liberty
aboard
this
yacht
not
one
of
our
lives
is
worth
a
sou
no
not
one
oh
you
shall
have
your
search
monk
gave
in
as
one
who
indulges
a
childish
whim
but
i
can
tell
you
now
what
we
find
or
wo
then
heaven
help
us
all
liane
went
swiftly
to
the
door
of
her
room
but
there
hesitated
looking
back
in
appeal
to
lanyard
i
am
afraid
let
me
have
a
look
round
first
and
when
lanyard
had
satisfied
himself
there
was
nobody
concealed
in
any
part
of
liane
suite
and
had
been
rewarded
with
a
glance
of
gratitude
i
shall
lock
myself
in
of
course
the
woman
said
from
the
threshold
and
i
have
my
pistol
too
but
i
assure
you
monk
commented
in
heavy
sarcasm
our
intentions
are
those
of
honourable
men
the
door
slammed
and
the
sound
of
the
key
turning
in
the
lock
followed
monk
trained
the
eyebrows
into
a
look
of
patience
a
glass
too
much
seein
things
no
lanyard
voiced
shortly
his
belief
you
are
wrong
liane
saw
something
nobody
questions
that
phinuit
yawned
what
one
does
question
is
whether
she
saw
a
man
or
a
figment
of
her
imagination
some
effect
of
the
shadows
that
momentarily
suggested
a
man
shadows
do
play
queer
tricks
at
night
at
sea
monk
agreed
i
remember
once
then
let
us
look
the
ground
over
and
see
if
we
can
make
that
explanation
acceptable
to
our
own
intelligences
lanyard
cut
in
no
harm
in
that
phinuit
fetched
a
pocket
and
the
three
reconnoitred
exhaustively
the
quarters
of
the
deck
in
which
the
apparition
had
manifested
itself
to
the
woman
by
no
strain
of
credulity
could
the
imagination
be
made
to
accept
the
effect
of
shadows
at
the
designated
spot
as
the
shape
of
somebody
standing
there
on
the
other
hand
when
phinuit
obligingly
posed
himself
between
the
mouth
of
the
companionway
and
the
skylight
it
had
to
be
admitted
that
the
glow
from
either
side
provided
fairly
good
cover
for
one
who
might
wish
to
linger
there
observing
and
unobserved
still
i
do
believe
she
saw
anything
monk
persisted
a
phantom
popinot
if
anything
but
wait
what
is
it
we
have
here
lanyard
scrutinising
the
deck
with
the
flashlamp
stooped
picked
up
something
and
offered
it
on
an
outspread
palm
upon
which
he
trained
the
clear
electric
beam
cigarette
stub
monk
said
and
sniffed
that
a
famous
find
a
cigarette
manufactured
by
the
french
régie
and
well
stepped
on
too
phinuit
observed
well
what
about
it
who
that
uses
this
part
of
the
deck
would
be
apt
to
insult
his
palate
with
such
a
cigarette
no
one
of
us
hardly
any
one
of
the
officers
or
stewards
some
might
have
sneaked
aft
for
a
expecting
to
find
the
quarterdeck
deserted
at
this
hour
even
ordinary
seamen
avoid
when
they
can
what
the
régie
sells
under
the
name
of
tobacco
nor
is
it
likely
such
a
one
would
risk
the
consequences
of
defying
captain
monk
celebrated
discipline
then
you
believe
it
was
popinot
too
i
believe
you
would
do
well
to
make
the
search
you
have
promised
thorough
and
immediate
plenty
of
time
monk
replied
wearily
i
turn
this
old
tub
inside
out
if
you
insist
in
the
morning
but
why
monsieur
do
you
remain
so
obstinately
incredulous
well
monk
drawled
i
known
the
pretty
lady
a
number
of
years
and
if
you
ask
me
she
quite
up
to
playing
little
games
all
her
own
pretending
you
mean
for
private
ends
the
eyebrows
offered
a
gesture
urbane
and
sceptical
whether
or
not
sleep
brought
monk
better
counsel
the
ransacking
of
the
vessel
and
the
examination
of
her
crew
proved
more
painstaking
than
lanyard
had
expected
and
the
upshot
was
precisely
as
monk
had
foretold
precisely
negative
he
reported
drily
to
this
effect
at
an
informal
conference
in
his
quarters
after
luncheon
he
himself
had
supervised
the
entire
search
and
had
made
a
good
part
of
it
in
person
he
said
no
nook
or
cranny
of
the
yacht
had
been
overlooked
i
trust
mademoiselle
is
satisfied
he
concluded
with
a
mockingly
civil
movement
of
eyebrows
toward
liane
his
reply
was
the
slightest
of
shrugs
executed
by
perfect
shoulders
beneath
a
gown
of
cynical
transparency
lanyard
was
aware
that
the
violet
eyes
large
with
apprehension
flashed
transiently
his
way
as
if
in
hope
that
he
might
submit
some
helpful
suggestion
but
he
had
none
to
offer
if
the
manner
in
which
the
search
had
been
conducted
were
open
to
criticism
that
would
have
to
be
made
by
a
mind
better
informed
than
his
in
respect
of
things
maritime
and
he
avoided
acknowledging
that
glance
by
even
so
much
as
seeming
aware
of
it
and
in
point
of
fact
coldly
reviewed
in
dispassionate
daylight
the
thing
seemed
preposterous
to
him
to
be
asked
to
believe
that
popinot
had
contrived
to
secrete
himself
beyond
finding
on
board
the
sybarite
without
his
participation
the
discussion
continued
he
heard
phinuit
voice
utter
in
accents
of
malicious
amusement
barring
of
course
the
possibility
of
connivance
on
the
part
of
officers
or
crew
do
be
an
ass
monk
snapped
do
be
unreasonable
i
am
simply
as
god
made
me
well
it
was
a
nasty
job
of
work
now
listen
phinuit
rose
to
leave
as
one
considering
the
conference
at
an
end
if
you
persist
in
picking
on
me
skipper
i
ravish
you
of
those
magnificent
eyebrows
with
a
safety
razor
some
time
when
you
asleep
and
leave
you
as
dumb
as
a
wop
peddler
who
lost
both
arms
liane
followed
him
out
in
silence
but
her
carriage
was
that
of
a
queen
of
tragedy
lanyard
got
up
in
turn
and
to
his
amazement
found
the
eyebrows
signalling
confidentially
to
him
what
the
devil
he
exclaimed
in
an
open
stare
immediately
the
eyebrows
became
conciliatory
well
monsieur
and
what
is
your
opinion
why
to
me
it
would
seem
there
might
be
something
in
the
suggestion
of
monsieur
phinuit
ridiculous
monk
dismissed
it
finally
do
you
know
i
rather
fancy
my
own
liane
up
to
something
he
added
explanatory
and
then
as
lanyard
said
nothing
you
have
told
me
yet
what
she
was
talking
to
you
about
last
night
just
before
her
alleged
fright
lanyard
contrived
a
successful
offensive
with
his
own
eyebrows
oh
he
said
have
i
and
walked
out
here
was
a
new
angle
to
consider
monk
attitude
hinted
at
a
possible
rift
in
the
entente
cordiale
of
the
conspirators
why
else
should
he
mistrust
liane
sincerity
in
asserting
that
she
had
seen
popinot
aside
from
the
question
of
what
he
imagined
she
could
possibly
gain
by
making
a
scene
out
of
nothing
a
riddle
unreadable
one
wondered
consumedly
what
had
happened
to
render
monk
suspicious
of
her
good
faith
the
explanation
when
it
was
finally
revealed
to
lanyard
by
the
most
trivial
of
incidents
made
even
his
own
blindness
seem
laughable
for
three
more
days
the
life
of
the
ship
followed
in
unruffled
tranquillity
its
ordered
course
liane
delorme
was
afflicted
with
no
more
visions
as
the
captain
would
have
called
them
though
by
common
consent
the
subject
had
been
dropped
upon
the
failure
of
the
search
and
to
all
seeming
was
rapidly
fading
from
the
minds
of
everybody
but
liane
herself
and
lanyard
this
last
continued
to
plague
himself
with
the
mystery
and
maintaining
always
an
open
mind
was
prepared
at
any
time
to
be
shockingly
enlightened
that
is
to
discover
that
liane
had
not
cried
wolf
without
substantial
reason
for
he
had
learned
this
much
at
least
of
life
that
everything
is
always
possible
as
for
liane
she
made
no
secret
of
her
unabated
timidity
yet
suffered
it
with
such
fortitude
as
could
not
fail
to
win
admiration
if
she
was
a
bit
more
subdued
a
trifle
less
than
was
her
habit
if
she
refused
positively
to
sit
with
her
back
to
any
door
or
to
retire
for
the
night
until
her
quarters
had
been
examined
if
as
lanyard
suspected
she
was
never
unarmed
for
a
moment
day
or
night
she
permitted
no
signs
of
mental
strain
to
mar
the
serenity
of
her
countenance
or
betray
the
studied
graciousness
of
her
gestures
toward
lanyard
she
bore
herself
precisely
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
disturb
the
even
adjustment
of
their
personal
relations
or
perhaps
as
if
she
considered
everything
had
happened
so
that
their
rapport
had
become
absolute
at
all
events
with
a
pleasing
absence
of
constraint
he
really
could
make
her
out
sometimes
he
thought
she
wished
him
to
believe
she
was
not
as
other
women
and
could
make
rational
allowance
for
his
poor
response
to
her
naïve
overtures
but
that
seemed
so
abnormal
he
felt
forced
to
fall
back
on
the
theory
that
her
declaration
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
minor
gambit
in
whatever
game
she
was
playing
and
that
consequently
she
bore
no
malice
because
of
its
failure
no
matter
which
explanation
was
the
true
one
no
matter
which
keyed
her
temper
toward
him
lanyard
found
himself
liking
the
woman
better
not
as
a
woman
but
as
another
human
being
than
he
had
ever
thought
to
say
what
you
liked
in
this
humour
she
was
charming
but
he
never
for
an
instant
imagined
she
was
meekly
accepting
defeat
at
his
hands
instead
of
biding
her
time
to
resume
the
attack
from
a
new
quarter
so
he
was
at
all
surprised
when
one
evening
quite
early
after
dinner
she
contrived
another
and
with
good
conversational
generalship
led
their
talk
presently
into
a
channel
of
amiable
personalities
and
have
you
been
thinking
about
what
we
said
or
what
i
said
my
friend
that
night
so
long
ago
it
seems
three
nights
ago
but
inevitably
liane
you
have
not
forgotten
my
stupidity
then
i
have
forgotten
nothing
she
made
a
pretty
mouth
of
doubt
would
it
not
have
been
more
kind
to
forget
such
compliments
are
not
easily
forgotten
you
are
sure
quite
sure
it
was
a
compliment
by
no
means
sure
still
i
am
a
man
and
i
am
giving
you
the
full
benefit
of
every
doubt
she
laughed
not
but
what
a
man
how
blessed
of
the
gods
to
be
able
to
laugh
at
yourself
as
well
as
at
me
undeceive
yourself
i
could
never
laugh
at
you
liane
even
if
one
did
not
believe
you
to
be
a
great
natural
comedienne
at
will
one
would
always
wonder
what
your
purpose
was
oh
yes
with
deep
respect
one
would
wonder
about
that
and
you
have
been
wondering
these
last
three
days
well
tell
me
what
you
think
my
purpose
was
in
abandoning
all
maidenly
reserve
and
throwing
myself
at
your
head
why
said
lanyard
with
a
look
of
childlike
candour
you
might
you
know
have
been
uncontrollably
swayed
by
some
passionate
impulses
of
the
heart
but
otherwise
she
prompted
hugely
amused
oh
if
you
had
a
low
motive
in
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
me
you
know
too
well
how
to
hide
your
motive
from
such
a
fool
in
a
fugitive
seizure
of
thoughtfulness
the
violet
eyes
lost
all
their
impishness
she
sighed
the
bright
head
drooped
a
little
toward
the
gleaming
bosom
a
hand
stole
out
to
rest
lightly
upon
his
once
again
it
was
not
acting
michael
i
tell
you
that
frankly
at
least
not
all
acting
meaning
i
take
it
you
know
love
too
well
to
make
it
artlessly
i
afraid
so
my
dear
said
liane
delorme
with
another
sigh
you
know
i
am
afraid
of
you
you
see
everything
so
clearly
it
a
vast
pity
i
wish
i
could
outgrow
it
one
misses
so
many
amusing
emotions
when
one
sees
too
clearly
during
another
brief
pause
lanyard
saw
monk
come
on
deck
pause
and
search
them
out
in
the
chairs
they
occupied
near
the
taffrail
much
as
on
that
other
historic
night
not
that
he
experienced
any
difficulty
in
locating
them
for
this
time
the
decklights
were
burning
clearly
nevertheless
captain
monk
confessed
emotion
at
sight
of
those
two
in
a
quite
perceptible
start
and
lanyard
saw
the
eyebrows
tremendously
agitated
as
their
manipulator
moved
aft
unconscious
of
all
this
liane
ended
her
pensive
moment
by
leaning
toward
lanyard
and
making
demoralizing
eyes
while
the
hand
left
his
and
stole
with
a
caressing
gesture
up
his
forearm
is
love
then
distasteful
to
you
unless
it
be
truly
artless
michael
there
so
much
to
be
said
about
that
liane
he
evaded
monk
was
standing
over
them
a
towering
figure
in
white
with
the
most
forbidding
eyebrows
lanyard
had
ever
seen
might
one
suggest
he
did
suggest
in
iced
accents
that
the
is
a
fairly
conspicuous
place
for
this
exhibition
of
family
affection
liane
delorme
turned
up
an
enquiring
look
tinged
slightly
with
an
impatience
which
all
at
once
proved
too
much
for
her
oh
go
to
the
devil
she
snapped
in
that
harsh
voice
of
the
sidewalks
which
she
was
able
to
use
and
discard
at
will
for
a
moment
monk
made
no
reply
and
lanyard
remarked
a
curious
quivering
of
that
excessively
tall
excessively
attenuated
body
a
real
trembling
and
suddenly
understood
that
the
absurd
creature
was
being
shaken
by
jealousy
by
an
enormous
passion
of
jealousy
quite
beyond
his
control
that
shook
him
very
much
as
a
cat
might
shake
a
mouse
it
was
too
funny
to
be
laughable
it
was
comic
in
a
way
to
make
one
want
to
weep
so
that
lanyard
who
refused
to
weep
in
public
could
merely
gape
in
speechless
and
transfixed
rapture
and
perhaps
this
was
fortunate
otherwise
monk
must
have
seen
that
his
idiotic
secret
was
out
the
sport
of
ribald
mirth
and
the
situation
must
have
been
precipitated
with
a
vengeance
and
an
outcome
impossible
to
predict
as
it
was
absorbed
in
his
inner
torment
monk
was
insensible
to
the
peril
that
threatened
his
stilted
but
precious
dignity
which
he
proceeded
to
parade
as
it
were
underlining
it
with
the
eyebrows
to
lend
emphasis
to
his
words
so
long
as
this
entertaining
fiction
of
is
thought
worth
while
he
said
with
infuriated
condescension
it
might
be
judicious
not
to
indulge
in
inconsistent
and
unseemly
demonstrations
of
affection
within
view
of
my
officers
and
crew
suppose
we
he
choked
a
little
in
short
i
came
to
invite
you
to
a
little
conference
in
my
rooms
with
mr
phinuit
conference
liane
enquired
coolly
without
stirring
i
know
nothing
of
this
conference
phinuit
and
i
are
agreed
that
monsieur
lanyard
is
entitled
to
know
more
about
our
intentions
while
he
has
time
to
weigh
them
carefully
we
have
only
four
more
days
at
sea
unable
longer
to
contain
himself
lanyard
left
his
chair
with
alacrity
but
this
is
so
delightful
you
no
idea
really
monsieur
how
i
have
looked
forward
to
this
moment
and
to
liane
do
come
and
see
how
i
take
it
this
revelation
of
my
preordained
fate
it
will
be
i
trust
sincerely
like
a
man
with
momentary
hesitation
and
in
a
temper
precluding
any
sympathy
with
his
humour
the
woman
rose
and
silently
followed
with
him
that
figure
whose
stalk
held
so
much
dramatic
significance
as
he
led
to
the
companionway
after
that
it
was
refreshing
to
find
unromantic
phinuit
lounging
beside
the
captain
desk
with
crossed
feet
overhanging
one
corner
of
it
and
mind
intent
on
the
prosaic
business
of
paring
his
fingernails
lanyard
nodded
to
him
with
great
good
temper
and
while
phinuit
lowered
his
feet
and
put
away
his
penknife
considerately
placed
a
chair
for
liane
in
the
position
in
which
she
preferred
to
sit
with
her
face
turned
a
little
from
the
light
nor
would
his
appreciation
of
the
formality
which
seemed
demanded
by
monk
solemn
manner
permit
him
to
sit
before
the
captain
had
taken
his
own
chair
behind
the
desk
then
however
he
discovered
the
engaging
spontaneity
of
a
schoolboy
at
a
pantomime
and
drawing
up
a
chair
sat
on
the
edge
of
it
and
addressed
himself
with
unaffected
eagerness
to
the
most
portentous
eyebrows
in
captivity
now
he
announced
with
a
little
bow
for
what
one
imagines
phinuit
would
term
the
elaborate
idea
xxiv
historic
repetition
phinuit
grinned
then
smothered
a
little
yawn
liane
delorme
gave
a
small
disdainful
movement
of
shoulders
and
posed
herself
becomingly
resting
an
elbow
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
inclining
her
cheek
upon
two
fingers
of
a
jewelled
hand
thus
she
sat
somewhat
turned
from
monk
and
phinuit
but
facing
lanyard
to
whom
her
grave
but
friendly
eyes
gave
undivided
heed
for
all
the
world
as
if
there
were
no
others
present
she
seemed
to
wait
to
hear
him
speak
again
rather
than
to
care
in
the
least
what
monk
would
find
to
say
captain
monk
filled
in
that
pause
with
an
impressive
arrangement
of
eyebrows
then
fixing
his
gaze
not
upon
lanyard
but
upon
the
point
of
a
pencil
with
which
his
incredibly
thin
fingers
traced
elaborate
but
empty
designs
upon
the
blotter
he
opened
his
lips
hemmed
in
warning
that
he
was
about
to
speak
and
seemed
tremendously
upset
to
find
that
liane
was
inconsiderately
forestalling
him
her
voice
was
at
its
most
musical
pitch
rather
low
for
her
fluting
infinitely
disarming
and
seductive
let
me
say
to
you
mon
ami
that
naturally
i
know
what
is
coming
i
disapprove
absolutely
of
this
method
of
treating
with
you
but
it
is
such
an
honour
to
be
considered
important
enough
to
be
treated
with
at
all
you
have
the
true
gift
for
sarcasm
a
pity
to
waste
it
on
an
audience
incapable
of
appreciation
oh
you
wrong
phinuit
declared
earnestly
i
appreciative
i
think
the
dear
man
immense
might
i
suggest
the
unctuous
tones
of
captain
monk
issued
from
under
mildly
wounded
eyebrows
if
any
one
of
us
were
unappreciative
of
monsieur
lanyard
undoubted
talents
he
would
not
be
with
us
tonight
you
might
suggest
it
phinuit
assented
but
that
would
make
it
so
it
is
to
mademoiselle
appreciation
that
you
and
i
owe
this
treat
and
you
know
it
now
quit
cocking
those
automatic
eyebrows
at
me
you
been
doing
that
ever
since
we
met
and
they
have
gone
off
yet
not
once
irrepressible
liane
laughter
pealed
and
though
he
could
help
smiling
lanyard
hastened
to
offer
up
himself
on
the
altar
of
peace
but
messieurs
you
interest
me
so
much
wo
you
tell
me
quickly
what
possible
value
my
poor
talents
can
have
found
in
your
sight
you
tell
him
monk
phinuit
said
irreverently
i
no
monk
elevated
his
eyebrows
above
recognition
of
the
impertinence
and
offered
lanyard
a
bow
of
formidable
courtesy
they
are
such
monsieur
he
said
with
that
deliberation
which
becomes
a
diplomatic
personage
your
talents
are
such
that
you
can
if
you
will
become
invaluable
to
us
phinuit
chuckled
outright
at
lanyard
look
of
polite
obtuseness
never
sail
a
straight
course
can
you
skipper
when
you
can
get
there
by
tacking
here
i
a
guy
let
me
act
as
an
interpreter
lanyard
this
giddy
association
of
malefactors
here
present
has
the
honour
to
invite
you
to
become
a
working
member
and
stockholder
of
equal
interest
with
the
rest
of
us
participating
in
all
benefits
of
the
organization
including
police
protection
and
as
added
inducement
we
willing
to
waive
initiation
fee
and
dues
do
i
make
myself
clear
but
perfectly
it
like
this
i
told
you
how
we
came
together
the
five
of
us
including
jules
and
monsieur
le
comte
de
lorgnes
now
we
expect
this
venture
our
first
to
pan
out
handsomely
there
be
a
juicy
melon
cut
when
we
get
to
new
york
there
a
lot
more
i
think
you
understand
than
the
montalais
plunder
to
whack
up
on
we
make
the
average
scheme
look
like
playing
store
in
the
with
two
pins
the
top
price
for
anything
on
the
shelves
and
there
is
any
sane
reason
why
we
need
stop
at
that
in
fact
we
do
mean
to
the
sybarite
will
make
more
voyages
and
if
anything
should
happen
to
stop
it
there
are
other
means
of
making
the
customs
look
foolish
each
of
us
contributes
valuable
and
essential
services
mademoiselle
the
skipper
my
even
i
and
i
pull
a
strong
oar
with
the
new
york
police
department
into
the
bargain
but
there
a
vacancy
in
our
ranks
the
opening
left
by
the
death
of
de
lorgnes
an
opening
that
nobody
could
hope
to
fill
so
well
as
you
so
we
put
it
up
to
you
squarely
if
you
sign
on
and
work
with
us
we
turn
over
to
you
a
round
fifth
share
of
the
profits
of
this
voyage
as
well
as
everything
that
comes
after
that
fair
enough
is
it
but
more
than
fair
monsieur
well
it
true
you
done
nothing
to
earn
a
fifth
interest
in
the
first
division
then
too
i
am
here
quite
helpless
in
your
hands
oh
we
do
look
at
it
that
way
which
liane
sweetly
interrupted
is
the
one
rational
gesture
you
have
yet
offered
in
this
conference
monsieur
phinuit
meaning
i
suppose
lanyard
is
far
from
being
what
he
says
helpless
in
our
hands
nor
ever
will
be
my
poor
friend
while
he
breathes
and
thinks
but
liane
lanyard
deprecated
modestly
casting
down
his
eyes
you
overwhelm
me
i
do
believe
you
liane
retorted
coolly
for
some
moments
lanyard
continued
to
stare
reflectively
at
his
feet
nothing
whatever
of
his
thought
was
to
be
gathered
from
his
countenance
though
eyes
more
shrewd
to
read
than
those
of
phinuit
or
monk
were
watching
it
intently
well
lanyard
what
do
you
say
lanyard
lifted
his
meditative
gaze
to
the
face
of
phinuit
but
surely
there
is
more
he
suggested
in
a
puzzled
way
more
what
i
find
something
lacking
you
have
shown
me
but
one
side
of
the
coin
what
is
the
reverse
i
appreciate
the
honour
you
do
me
i
comprehend
fully
the
strong
inducements
i
am
offered
but
you
have
neglected
an
odd
oversight
on
the
part
of
the
man
you
profess
to
be
you
have
forgotten
to
name
the
penalty
which
would
attach
to
a
possible
refusal
i
guess
it
safe
to
leave
that
to
your
imagination
there
would
be
a
penalty
however
well
naturally
if
you
not
with
us
you
against
us
and
to
take
that
stand
would
oblige
us
as
a
simple
matter
of
to
defend
ourselves
with
every
means
at
our
command
means
which
lanyard
murmured
you
prefer
not
to
name
well
one
does
like
to
be
crude
i
have
my
answer
monsieur
and
many
thanks
the
parallel
is
complete
with
a
dim
smile
playing
in
his
eyes
and
twitching
at
the
corners
of
his
lips
lanyard
leaned
back
and
studied
the
deck
beams
liane
delorme
sat
up
with
a
movement
of
sharp
uneasiness
of
what
my
friend
are
you
thinking
i
am
marvelling
at
something
everybody
knows
that
history
does
repeat
itself
the
woman
made
a
sudden
hissing
sound
of
breath
drawn
shortly
between
closed
teeth
i
hope
not
she
sighed
lanyard
opened
his
eyes
wide
at
her
you
hope
not
liane
i
hope
this
time
history
will
not
altogether
repeat
itself
you
see
my
friend
i
think
i
know
what
is
in
your
mind
memories
of
old
times
true
i
am
thinking
of
those
days
when
the
pack
hunted
the
lone
wolf
in
paris
ran
him
to
earth
at
last
and
made
him
much
the
same
offer
as
you
have
made
the
pack
you
should
know
messieurs
was
the
name
assumed
by
an
association
of
parisian
criminals
ambitious
like
you
who
had
grown
envious
of
the
lone
wolf
success
and
wished
to
persuade
him
to
run
with
them
and
what
happened
phinuit
enquired
why
it
so
happened
that
they
chose
the
time
when
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
be
good
for
the
rest
of
my
days
it
was
all
most
unfortunate
what
answer
did
you
give
them
then
as
memory
serves
i
told
them
they
could
all
go
plumb
to
hell
so
i
hope
history
will
not
repeat
this
time
liane
interjected
and
did
they
go
monk
asked
presently
some
of
them
ultimately
all
for
some
lingered
a
few
years
in
french
prisons
like
that
great
popinot
the
father
of
monsieur
who
has
caused
us
so
much
trouble
and
you
why
lanyard
laughed
i
have
managed
to
keep
out
of
jail
so
i
presume
i
must
have
kept
my
vow
to
be
good
and
no
backsliding
phinuit
suggested
with
a
leer
ah
you
must
not
ask
me
to
tell
you
everything
that
is
a
matter
between
me
and
my
conscience
well
phinuit
hazarded
with
a
good
show
of
confidence
i
guess
you
wo
tell
us
to
go
plumb
to
hell
will
you
no
i
promise
to
be
more
original
than
that
then
you
refuse
liane
breathed
tensely
oh
i
have
said
that
you
must
give
me
time
to
think
this
over
i
knew
that
would
be
his
answer
monk
proclaimed
pride
in
his
perspicuity
shaping
the
set
of
his
eyebrows
that
is
why
i
was
firm
that
we
should
wait
no
longer
you
have
four
days
in
which
to
make
up
your
mind
monsieur
i
shall
need
them
i
do
see
why
phinuit
argued
it
an
open
and
shut
proposition
if
ever
there
was
one
but
you
are
asking
me
to
renounce
something
upon
which
i
have
set
much
store
for
many
years
monsieur
i
ca
be
expected
to
do
that
in
an
hour
or
even
a
day
you
shall
have
your
answer
i
promise
you
by
the
time
we
make
our
landfall
perhaps
before
the
sooner
the
better
are
you
sure
monsieur
but
one
thought
it
was
the
tortoise
who
won
the
famous
race
take
all
the
time
you
need
captain
monk
conceded
generously
to
come
to
a
sensible
decision
but
how
good
you
are
to
me
monsieur
xxv
the
malcontent
singular
though
the
statement
may
seem
when
one
remembers
the
conditions
that
circumscribed
his
freedom
of
action
on
board
the
sybarite
that
he
stood
utterly
alone
in
that
company
of
conspirators
and
their
creatures
alone
and
unarmed
with
never
a
friend
to
guard
his
back
or
even
to
whisper
him
one
word
of
counsel
warning
or
encouragement
with
only
his
naked
wits
and
hands
to
fortify
and
sustain
his
heart
it
is
still
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
lanyard
got
an
extraordinary
amount
of
private
diversion
out
of
those
last
few
days
from
the
hour
when
liane
delorme
phinuit
and
captain
monk
in
conclave
solemnly
assembled
at
the
instance
of
the
one
communicated
their
collective
mind
in
respect
of
his
interesting
self
the
man
was
conscious
of
implicit
confidence
in
a
happy
outcome
of
the
business
with
a
conscientiousness
less
rational
than
simply
felt
a
sort
of
bubbling
exhilaration
in
his
mood
that
found
its
most
intelligible
expression
in
the
phrase
which
he
was
wont
often
to
iterate
to
himself
ça
va
bien
that
goes
well
that
the
progressive
involution
of
this
insane
imbroglio
went
very
well
indeed
in
lanyard
reckoning
he
could
hardy
wish
he
could
not
reasonably
demand
that
it
should
go
better
he
knew
now
with
what
design
liane
delorme
had
made
him
a
party
to
this
sea
adventure
and
intimate
with
every
detail
of
the
conspiracy
and
he
knew
to
boot
why
she
had
offered
him
the
free
gift
of
her
love
doubt
as
to
the
one
scruples
inspired
by
the
other
that
reluctance
which
man
can
not
but
feel
to
do
a
hurt
to
a
heart
that
holds
him
dear
however
scanty
his
response
to
its
passion
could
no
longer
influence
him
to
palter
in
dealing
with
the
woman
the
revelation
had
in
effect
stricken
shackles
from
lanyard
wrists
now
when
he
struck
it
would
be
with
neither
hesitation
nor
compunction
as
to
that
stroke
alone
its
hour
and
place
and
fashion
he
remained
without
decision
he
had
made
a
hundred
plans
for
its
delivery
and
one
of
them
that
seemed
the
wildest
he
thought
of
seriously
as
something
really
feasible
but
that
made
it
difficult
if
only
one
could
devise
some
way
to
be
in
two
places
at
one
time
and
the
same
an
impossibility
he
would
deny
that
but
lanyard
had
never
been
one
to
be
discouraged
by
the
grim
hard
face
of
an
impossibility
he
had
known
too
many
such
to
dissipate
utterly
vanish
into
empty
air
when
subjected
to
a
bold
and
resolute
assault
he
would
say
die
never
that
while
he
could
lift
hand
or
invent
stratagem
never
that
so
long
as
fools
played
their
game
into
his
hands
as
this
lot
wished
to
and
did
what
imbecility
what
an
escape
had
been
his
when
in
that
time
long
since
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
have
done
with
crime
once
and
for
all
time
but
for
that
moment
of
clear
vision
and
high
resolve
he
might
be
even
as
these
who
had
won
such
clear
title
to
his
contempt
who
stultified
themselves
with
vain
imaginings
and
the
everlasting
concoction
of
schemes
whose
sheer
intrinsic
puerility
foredoomed
them
to
farcical
failure
lanyard
trod
the
decks
for
hours
at
a
time
searching
the
stars
for
an
answer
to
the
question
what
made
the
law
by
whose
decree
man
may
garner
only
punishment
and
disaster
where
he
has
husbanded
in
iniquity
that
law
implacable
inexorable
in
its
ordained
and
methodic
workings
through
which
invariably
it
comes
to
pass
that
failure
and
remorse
shall
canker
in
the
heart
even
of
success
but
if
he
moralized
it
was
with
a
cheerful
countenance
and
his
sermons
were
for
himself
alone
he
kept
his
counsel
and
spoke
all
men
fairly
giving
nowhere
any
manner
of
offense
for
could
he
tell
in
what
unlikely
guise
might
wait
the
instrument
he
needed
wherewith
to
work
out
his
unfaltering
purpose
and
all
the
while
they
were
watching
him
and
wondering
what
was
in
his
mind
well
he
gave
no
sign
let
them
watch
and
wonder
to
their
content
they
must
wait
until
the
time
he
had
appointed
for
the
rendering
of
his
decision
when
the
sybarite
made
her
landfall
winds
blew
and
fell
the
sea
rose
and
subsided
the
sybarite
trudged
on
into
dull
weather
the
sky
grew
overcast
and
lanyard
daily
scanning
the
very
heavens
for
a
sign
accepted
this
for
one
and
prayed
it
might
hold
nothing
could
be
more
calculated
to
nullify
his
efforts
than
to
have
the
landfall
happen
on
a
clear
calm
night
of
stars
he
went
to
bed
the
last
night
out
leaving
a
noisy
gathering
in
the
saloon
and
read
himself
drowsy
then
turning
out
his
light
he
slept
sometime
later
he
found
himself
instantaneously
awake
and
alert
with
a
clear
head
and
every
faculty
on
the
qui
vive
much
as
a
man
might
grope
for
a
time
in
a
dark
strange
room
then
find
a
door
and
step
out
into
broad
daylight
only
there
was
no
light
other
than
in
the
luminous
clarity
of
his
mind
even
the
illumination
in
the
saloon
had
been
dimmed
down
for
the
night
as
he
could
tell
by
the
tarnished
gleam
beneath
his
stateroom
door
still
not
everyone
had
gone
to
bed
the
very
manner
of
his
waking
informed
him
that
he
was
not
alone
for
the
life
lanyard
had
led
had
taught
him
to
need
no
better
alarm
than
the
entrance
of
another
person
into
the
place
where
he
lay
sleeping
all
animals
are
like
that
whose
lives
hang
on
their
vigilance
able
to
see
nothing
he
still
felt
a
presence
and
knew
that
it
waited
stirless
within
of
his
head
without
much
concern
he
thought
of
popinot
that
phantom
popinot
of
monk
derisive
naming
well
if
the
vision
liane
had
seen
on
deck
had
taken
material
form
here
in
his
stateroom
lanyard
presumed
it
meant
another
fight
and
the
last
to
a
finish
that
is
to
say
to
a
death
without
making
a
sound
he
gathered
himself
together
ready
for
a
trap
and
as
noiselessly
lifted
a
hand
toward
the
switch
for
the
electric
light
set
in
the
wall
near
the
head
of
the
bed
but
in
the
same
breath
he
heard
a
whisper
or
rather
a
mutter
a
voice
he
could
not
place
in
its
present
pitch
awake
monsieur
delorme
it
said
hush
do
make
a
row
and
never
mind
the
light
his
astonishment
was
so
overpowering
that
instinctively
his
tensed
muscles
relaxed
and
his
hand
fell
back
upon
the
bedding
who
the
deuce
not
so
loud
it
me
mussey
lanyard
echoed
witlessly
mussey
yes
i
do
wonder
you
surprised
but
if
you
be
easy
understand
pretty
soon
why
i
had
to
have
a
bit
of
a
talk
with
you
without
anybody
catching
on
well
lanyard
said
i
damned
i
say
the
subdued
mutter
took
on
a
note
of
anxiety
it
all
right
is
it
i
mean
you
are
going
to
kick
up
a
rumpus
and
spill
the
beans
i
guess
you
must
think
i
got
a
hell
of
a
gall
coming
in
on
you
like
this
and
i
do
know
as
i
blame
you
but
well
getting
short
only
two
more
days
at
sea
and
i
could
wait
any
longer
for
a
chance
to
have
a
few
minutes
chin
with
you
the
mutter
ceased
and
held
an
expectant
pause
lanyard
said
nothing
but
he
was
conscious
that
the
speaker
occupied
a
chair
by
the
bed
and
knew
that
he
was
bending
near
to
catch
his
answer
for
the
air
was
tainted
with
vinous
breath
yes
one
required
no
stronger
identification
it
was
beyond
any
doubt
the
chief
engineer
of
the
sybarite
say
it
all
right
wo
you
the
mutter
pleaded
i
am
listening
lanyard
replied
as
you
perceive
i
say
it
decent
of
you
damned
decent
blowed
if
i
take
it
as
calm
as
you
if
i
waked
up
to
find
somebody
in
my
room
i
believe
said
lanyard
pointedly
you
stipulated
for
a
few
chin
with
me
time
passes
mussey
get
to
your
business
or
let
me
go
to
sleep
again
sharp
you
are
commented
the
mutter
i
noticed
it
in
you
be
surprised
if
you
knew
how
much
notice
i
been
taking
of
you
and
flattered
i
sure
look
here
the
mutter
stumbled
i
want
to
ask
a
personal
question
daresay
you
think
it
impertinent
if
i
do
be
sure
i
sha
answer
it
well
it
this
is
or
is
your
right
name
lanyard
michael
lanyard
this
time
it
was
lanyard
who
thinking
rapidly
held
the
pause
so
long
that
his
querist
uneasiness
could
not
contain
itself
is
that
my
answer
i
mean
does
your
silence
that
an
unusual
name
michael
lanyard
cautiously
replied
its
proprietor
how
did
you
get
hold
of
it
they
say
it
the
right
name
of
the
lone
wolf
guess
i
do
have
to
tell
you
who
the
lone
wolf
is
say
who
please
are
oh
there
a
lot
of
talk
going
around
the
ship
you
know
how
it
is
a
crew
will
gossip
and
god
knows
they
got
enough
excuse
this
cruise
this
was
constructively
evasive
lanyard
wondered
who
had
betrayed
him
phinuit
the
tongue
of
that
man
was
hinged
in
the
middle
but
one
could
feel
certain
liane
delorme
had
made
much
of
the
chief
engineer
though
she
seemed
less
likely
to
talk
too
much
than
anyone
of
the
ship
company
but
lanyard
himself
but
then
one
remembered
of
a
sudden
monk
and
mussey
were
by
reputation
old
cronies
it
inconceivable
that
monk
might
have
let
something
slip
and
what
mussey
if
i
should
admit
i
am
michael
lanyard
then
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
something
i
think
interest
you
why
not
run
the
risk
of
interesting
me
whoever
i
may
be
mussey
breathed
heavily
in
the
stillness
the
breathing
of
a
cautious
man
loath
to
commit
himself
no
he
said
at
length
in
the
clearest
enunciation
he
had
thus
far
used
no
if
you
not
lanyard
i
rather
say
nothing
more
just
ask
you
to
pardon
me
for
intruding
and
clear
out
but
you
say
there
is
some
gossip
and
where
there
is
smoke
there
must
be
fire
it
would
seem
safe
to
assume
i
am
the
man
gossip
says
i
am
michael
lanyard
the
mutter
persisted
the
lone
wolf
yes
yes
what
then
i
suppose
the
best
way
to
put
it
to
you
straight
i
warn
you
you
gain
nothing
if
you
do
then
to
begin
at
the
beginning
i
known
whit
monk
a
good
long
time
years
i
known
him
we
sailed
together
off
and
on
ever
since
we
took
to
the
sea
we
gone
through
some
nasty
scrapes
together
and
done
things
that
do
bear
telling
and
always
shared
the
thick
and
the
thin
of
everything
before
this
if
anybody
had
ever
told
me
whit
monk
would
do
a
pal
dirt
punched
his
head
and
thought
no
more
about
it
but
now
the
mutter
faltered
lanyard
preserved
a
sympathetic
silence
a
silence
at
least
which
he
hoped
would
pass
as
sympathetic
in
reality
he
was
struggling
to
suppress
any
betrayal
of
the
exultation
that
was
beginning
to
take
hold
of
him
premature
this
might
prove
to
be
but
it
seemed
impossible
to
misunderstand
the
emotion
under
which
the
chief
engineer
was
labouring
or
to
underestimate
its
potential
value
to
lanyard
surely
it
would
seem
that
his
faith
in
his
star
had
been
was
it
not
now
or
all
signs
failed
delivering
into
his
hand
the
forged
tool
he
had
so
desperately
needed
for
which
he
had
so
earnestly
prayed
a
heavy
sigh
issued
upon
the
stillness
freighted
with
a
deep
and
desolating
melancholy
for
it
appeared
like
all
cynics
mussey
was
a
sentimentalist
at
heart
and
in
the
darkness
that
disembodied
voice
took
up
its
tale
anew
i
do
have
to
tell
you
what
going
on
between
whit
and
that
lot
he
so
thick
with
nowadays
you
know
or
you
would
be
here
is
that
conclusion
what
you
americans
would
call
a
little
previous
previous
the
mutter
took
a
moment
to
con
the
full
significance
of
that
adjective
no
i
would
call
it
that
you
see
on
a
voyage
like
this
well
talk
goes
on
things
get
about
things
are
said
aloud
that
should
be
and
get
overheard
and
passed
along
and
the
man
who
sits
back
and
listens
and
sifts
what
he
hears
is
pretty
likely
to
get
a
tolerably
good
line
on
what
what
of
course
there
never
been
any
secret
about
what
the
owner
means
to
do
with
all
this
wine
shipped
we
all
know
we
playing
a
risky
game
but
we
for
the
owner
he
is
a
bad
sort
when
you
get
to
know
him
and
we
go
through
with
it
and
take
what
coming
to
us
win
or
lose
partly
of
course
because
it
mean
something
handsome
for
every
man
if
we
make
it
without
getting
caught
but
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
tell
you
something
but
truly
i
am
all
attention
i
think
whit
monk
and
phinuit
and
have
framed
the
owner
between
them
ca
say
i
quite
follow
i
think
they
cooked
up
this
smuggling
business
and
kidded
him
into
it
just
to
get
the
use
of
his
yacht
for
their
own
purposes
and
at
the
same
time
get
him
where
he
ca
put
up
a
howl
if
he
finds
out
the
truth
suppose
he
does
the
mutter
became
momentarily
a
chuckle
of
malice
he
in
so
deep
on
the
booze
smuggling
side
he
dassent
say
a
word
and
that
puts
him
in
worse
yet
makes
him
accessory
before
the
fact
of
criminal
practices
that
made
his
hair
stand
on
end
then
suppose
they
want
to
go
on
with
the
game
looting
in
europe
and
sneaking
the
goods
into
america
with
the
use
of
his
yacht
he
going
to
say
how
he
going
to
stop
them
accepting
these
questions
as
purely
rhetorical
lanyard
offered
no
comment
after
a
moment
the
mutter
resumed
well
what
do
you
think
am
i
right
or
am
i
wrong
who
knows
mussey
one
can
only
say
you
seem
to
know
something
i
say
i
know
something
a
sight
more
than
whit
monk
dreams
i
know
as
he
find
out
to
his
sorrow
before
he
finished
with
tom
mussey
but
obliquely
lanyard
struck
again
at
the
heart
of
the
mystery
which
he
found
so
baffling
you
seem
so
well
satisfied
with
the
bona
fides
of
your
informant
there
was
a
sound
of
stertorous
breathing
as
the
intelligence
behind
the
mutter
grappled
with
this
utterance
then
as
if
the
hint
had
proved
too
fine
i
playing
my
hand
face
up
with
you
lanyard
i
guess
you
can
tell
i
know
what
i
talking
about
but
what
i
can
not
see
is
why
you
should
talk
about
it
to
me
monsieur
why
because
i
and
you
are
both
in
the
same
boat
in
a
manner
of
speaking
we
both
on
the
outside
shut
out
looking
in
in
a
sort
of
mental
aside
lanyard
reflected
that
mixed
bathing
for
metaphors
was
apparently
countenanced
under
the
code
of
cynics
does
one
gather
that
you
feel
aggrieved
with
captain
monk
for
not
making
you
a
partner
in
his
new
associations
for
trying
to
put
one
over
on
me
an
old
pal
stood
by
him
through
thick
and
thin
would
gone
through
fire
for
whit
monk
and
in
my
way
i
have
many
the
time
and
now
he
hooks
up
with
phinuit
and
this
delorme
woman
and
leaves
me
to
shuffle
my
feet
on
the
doormat
and
thinks
i
let
him
get
away
with
it
the
voice
in
the
dark
gave
a
grunt
of
infinite
contempt
like
hell
i
understand
your
feelings
monsieur
and
i
ask
you
to
believe
in
my
sympathy
but
you
said
if
i
remember
that
we
were
in
the
same
boat
you
and
i
whereas
i
assure
you
captain
monk
has
not
abused
my
friendship
since
he
has
never
had
it
i
know
that
well
enough
said
the
mutter
i
do
mean
you
got
my
reasons
for
feeling
sore
but
i
do
mean
you
got
reason
enough
of
your
own
on
what
grounds
do
you
say
that
another
deliberate
pause
prefaced
the
reply
you
said
a
while
ago
i
knew
something
well
you
said
it
i
and
you
both
been
frozen
out
of
this
deal
and
we
both
meaning
to
take
a
hand
whether
they
like
it
or
not
if
that
do
put
us
in
the
same
boat
i
do
know
perceiving
he
would
get
no
more
satisfaction
lanyard
schooled
himself
to
be
politic
for
the
time
being
say
it
is
so
then
but
i
think
you
have
something
to
propose
it
simple
enough
when
two
people
find
themselves
in
the
same
boat
they
got
to
pull
together
if
they
want
to
get
anywhere
you
propose
then
an
alliance
that
the
answer
without
you
i
ca
do
anything
but
kick
over
the
applecart
for
whit
monk
and
that
sort
of
revenge
is
mighty
unsatisfactory
without
me
well
what
can
you
do
i
know
you
can
get
that
tin
safe
of
whit
open
when
you
feel
like
it
get
the
jewels
and
all
but
what
show
do
you
stand
to
get
away
with
them
that
is
unless
you
got
somebody
working
in
with
you
on
board
the
ship
see
here
the
mutter
sank
into
a
husky
whisper
and
in
order
to
be
heard
the
speaker
bent
so
low
over
lanyard
that
fumes
of
whiskey
almost
suffocated
the
poor
man
in
his
bed
you
got
a
head
you
had
experience
you
know
how
well
go
to
it
make
your
plans
consult
with
me
get
everything
fixed
lift
the
loot
i
stand
by
fix
up
everything
so
your
work
will
go
through
slick
see
that
you
do
get
hurt
stow
the
jewels
where
they
wo
be
found
and
when
it
all
over
we
split
what
say
extremely
ingenious
monsieur
but
unfortunately
impracticable
that
the
last
thing
stated
the
disappointed
whisper
i
ever
thought
a
man
like
you
would
say
but
it
is
obvious
we
do
not
know
each
other
you
mean
you
ca
trust
me
for
that
matter
how
can
you
be
sure
you
can
trust
me
oh
i
guess
i
can
size
up
a
square
guy
when
i
see
him
many
thanks
but
why
should
i
trust
you
when
you
will
not
even
be
quite
frank
with
me
how
that
have
i
one
moment
you
refuse
to
name
the
source
of
your
astonishingly
detailed
information
concerning
this
affair
myself
included
you
wish
me
to
believe
you
simply
assume
i
am
at
odds
with
captain
monk
and
his
friends
i
admit
it
is
true
but
how
should
you
know
it
ah
no
my
friend
either
you
will
tell
me
how
you
learned
this
secret
or
i
must
beg
you
to
let
me
get
my
sleep
that
easy
i
heard
whit
and
phinuit
talking
about
you
the
other
night
on
deck
when
they
did
think
anybody
was
listening
lanyard
smiled
into
the
darkness
no
need
to
fret
about
fair
play
toward
this
one
the
truth
was
not
in
him
and
by
the
same
token
the
traditional
honour
that
obtains
among
thieves
could
not
be
he
said
as
if
content
in
the
manner
of
a
practical
man
dismissing
all
immaterial
considerations
as
you
say
the
time
is
brief
it
have
to
be
pulled
off
night
or
not
at
all
the
mutter
urged
with
an
eager
accent
my
thought
precisely
for
then
we
come
to
land
do
we
not
yes
and
it
have
to
be
not
long
after
dark
we
ought
to
drop
the
hook
at
midnight
then
the
mutter
was
broken
with
hopeful
anxiety
then
you
decided
you
stand
in
with
me
mr
lanyard
but
of
course
what
else
can
one
do
as
you
have
so
fairly
pointed
out
what
is
either
of
us
without
the
other
and
it
understood
you
to
lift
the
stuff
i
to
take
care
of
it
till
we
can
slip
ashore
we
to
make
our
getaway
together
and
the
split
to
be
fair
and
square
i
ask
nothing
better
where
your
hand
two
hands
found
each
other
blindly
and
exchanged
a
firm
and
inspiring
clasp
while
lanyard
gave
thanks
for
the
night
that
saved
his
face
from
betraying
his
mind
another
deep
sigh
sounded
a
note
of
apprehensions
at
an
end
a
gruff
chuckle
followed
whit
monk
he
learn
something
about
the
way
to
treat
old
friends
and
all
at
once
the
mutter
merged
into
a
vindictive
hiss
him
with
his
airs
and
graces
his
fine
clothes
and
greasy
manners
putting
on
the
over
them
that
stood
by
him
when
he
had
a
red
and
was
glad
to
cadge
drinks
off
spiggoties
in
hells
like
the
colonel
at
colon
him
but
lanyard
had
been
listening
only
with
his
ears
he
had
the
slightest
interest
in
mussey
resentment
of
the
affectations
of
captain
monk
for
now
his
mad
scheme
had
suddenly
assumed
a
complexion
of
comparative
simplicity
given
the
of
the
chief
engineer
all
lanyard
would
need
to
contribute
would
be
a
little
headwork
a
little
physical
exertion
a
little
daring
and
complete
indifference
which
was
both
well
warranted
and
already
his
to
abusing
the
confidence
of
mussey
but
about
this
affair
night
he
interrupted
impatiently
attend
to
me
a
little
if
you
please
my
friend
can
you
give
me
any
idea
where
we
are
or
will
approximately
at
midnight
what
that
go
to
do
perhaps
i
ask
only
for
my
own
information
but
it
may
be
that
i
have
a
plan
if
we
are
to
work
together
harmoniously
mussey
you
must
learn
to
have
a
little
confidence
in
me
beg
your
pardon
said
an
humble
mutter
we
ought
to
be
somewhere
off
nantucket
shoals
lightship
and
the
weather
have
you
sufficient
acquaintance
with
these
latitudes
to
foretell
it
even
roughly
born
and
brought
up
in
edgartown
made
my
first
voyage
on
a
tramp
out
of
new
bedford
guess
i
know
something
about
the
weather
in
these
latitudes
the
wind
been
hauling
round
from
to
south
all
day
if
it
goes
on
to
it
likely
be
thick
with
little
wind
no
sea
to
speak
of
and
either
rain
or
fog
so
now
to
do
what
i
will
have
to
do
i
must
have
ten
minutes
of
absolute
darkness
can
that
be
arranged
absolute
darkness
the
mutter
had
a
rising
inflexion
of
dubiety
how
mean
complete
extinguishing
of
every
light
on
the
ship
my
god
the
mutter
protested
do
you
know
what
that
means
no
lights
at
night
under
way
in
waters
why
by
nightfall
we
ought
to
be
off
block
island
in
traffic
as
heavy
as
on
fifth
avenue
no
too
much
too
bad
lanyard
uttered
philosophic
and
the
thing
could
have
been
done
is
there
some
other
way
not
with
lights
to
hamper
my
operations
but
if
some
temporary
accident
were
to
put
the
dynamoes
out
of
commission
figure
to
yourself
what
would
happen
there
be
hell
to
pay
ah
but
what
else
the
engines
would
have
to
be
slowed
down
so
as
to
give
no
more
than
until
oil
lamps
could
be
substituted
for
the
binnacle
masthead
and
also
for
the
engine
room
and
there
would
be
excitement
and
confusion
eh
everybody
would
make
for
the
deck
even
the
captain
would
leave
his
cabin
unguarded
long
enough
i
get
you
with
a
sigh
it
wrong
all
wrong
but
well
i
suppose
it
got
to
be
done
lanyard
treated
himself
to
a
smile
of
triumph
there
in
the
darkness
xxvi
the
binnacle
it
would
have
been
ungrateful
lanyard
reflected
over
his
breakfast
to
complain
of
a
life
so
replete
with
experiences
of
piquant
contrast
it
happened
to
one
to
lie
for
hours
in
a
cubicle
of
blinding
night
hearkening
to
a
voice
like
that
of
some
nightmare
weirdly
become
articulate
a
ghostly
mutter
that
rose
and
fell
and
droned
broken
by
sighs
grunts
stifled
oaths
mean
chuckles
with
intervals
of
husky
whispering
and
lapses
filled
with
a
noise
of
wheezing
respiration
all
wheedling
and
cajoling
lying
intimating
and
evading
complaining
snarling
rambling
threatening
protesting
promising
and
in
the
end
proposing
an
unholy
compact
for
treachery
and
a
voice
that
might
have
issued
out
of
some
damned
soul
escaped
for
a
little
space
of
time
from
the
pits
of
torment
so
utterly
inhuman
it
sounded
so
completely
discarnate
and
divorced
from
all
relationship
to
any
mortal
personality
that
even
that
reek
of
whiskey
in
the
air
even
that
one
contact
with
a
hard
hot
hand
could
not
make
it
seem
real
and
then
it
ceased
and
was
no
more
but
as
a
thing
of
dream
that
had
passed
and
one
came
awake
to
a
light
and
wholesome
world
furnished
with
such
solidly
comforting
facts
as
soaps
and
razors
and
hot
and
cold
saltwater
taps
and
subsequently
one
left
one
stateroom
to
see
at
the
breakfast
table
and
flushed
of
countenance
an
amorphous
lump
of
humid
flesh
in
shapeless
garments
of
soiled
white
duck
the
author
of
that
mutter
in
the
dark
who
lounging
over
a
plate
of
broken
food
and
lifting
a
coffee
cup
in
the
tremulous
hand
of
an
alcoholic
looked
up
with
lacklustre
gaze
gave
a
surly
nod
and
mumbled
the
customary
matutinal
greeting
monseer
delorme
it
was
all
too
weird
to
add
to
this
the
chief
engineer
paid
lanyard
no
further
heed
at
all
though
they
were
alone
at
table
and
having
noisily
consumed
his
coffee
rubbed
his
stubbled
lips
and
chin
with
an
napkin
rose
and
without
word
or
glance
rolled
heavily
up
the
companionway
the
conduct
of
a
careful
man
accustomed
to
mind
his
eye
and
indisputably
correct
one
never
knew
who
might
be
watching
what
slightest
sign
of
secret
understanding

not
be
seized
upon
and
read

mussey

not
stilled
his
mutter
in
the
night
until
their
joint
and
individual
lines
of
action
had
been
elaborately
mapped
out
and
agreed
upon
down
to
the
smallest
detail
it
now
remained
only
for

to
fill
in
somehow
the
waste
time
that
lay
between

and
the
hour
appointed

due
advantage

acquainting

the

spot
selected
from
the

transaction
his
notion
of
the
precise
location
of

rather
indefinite

had
gathered
from

that
it

on
the
connecticut

of

and

where

the

seeing
that
harbour
it
was
the
approach
alone
that
interested
him
and
when
he
had
puzzled
out
that
there
were
only
two
practicable
courses
for
the
sybarite
to
take
both
bearing
in
a
general
direction
from
nantucket
shoals
light
vessel
one
entering
block
island
sound
from
the
east
between
point
judith
and
block
island
the
other
entering
the
same
body
of
water
from
the
south
between
block
island
and
montauk
point
and
had
satisfied
himself
that
manifold
perils
to
navigation
hedged
about
both
courses
more
especially
their
prolongation
into
long
island
sound
by
way
of
the
race
lanyard
told
himself
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
his
plans
miscarried
always
providing
that
mussey
could
be
trusted
to
hold
to
his
overnight
agreement
but
as
to
that
one
entertained
few
fears
one
felt
quite
sure
that
mussey
would
perform
duly
to
the
letter
of
his
covenant
it
had
required
only
an
hour
of
weighing
and
analysing
with
a
clear
head
his
overtures
and
utterances
as
a
whole
to
persuade
lanyard
that
he
himself
no
less
than
the
chief
engineer
in
the
phrase
of
the
boast
knew
something
it
seemed
unbelievably
stupid
and
childish
what
he
imagined
was
behind
the
gratuitous
intermeddling
of
mussey
but
then
he
reminded
himself
if
there
is
anything
more
stupid
than
to
plot
a
criminal
act
it
is
to
permit
oneself
to
be
influenced
by
that
criminal
stupidity
whose
other
name
is
jealousy
well
whether
he
were
right
or
wrong
the
night
would
declare
it
and
in
any
event
there
was
no
excuse
whatever
for
refusing
to
profit
by
the
stupidity
of
men
whose
minds
are
bent
on
vicious
mischief
the
weather
thickened
as
the
day
grew
older
towards
noon
the
wind
as
if
weary
and
discouraged
with
vain
endeavour
to
make
up
its
mind
to
blow
from
this
quarter
or
that
died
away
altogether
at
the
same
time
the
horizon
appeared
to
close
in
perceptibly
what
little
definition
it
had
had
in
earlier
hours
was
erased
and
the
sybarite
shearing
the
oily
and
lifeless
waters
of
a
dead
calm
seemed
less
to
make
progress
than
to
struggle
sullenly
in
a
pool
of
quicksilver
at
the
bottom
of
a
slowly
revolving
sphere
of
clouded
glass
mutinously
aware
that
all
her
labouring
wrought
no
sort
of
gain
after
an
hour
of
this
captain
monk
on
the
bridge
with
swain
arrived
at
a
decision
of
exasperation
through
the
ventilators
a
long
jingle
of
the
telegraph
was
heard
and
directly
the
sybarite
pulses
began
to
beat
in
quicker
tempo
while
darker
volutes
of
smoke
rolled
in
dense
volume
from
her
funnel
and
streamed
away
astern
resting
low
and
preserving
their
individuality
as
long
as
visible
like
a
streak
of
oxidization
on
a
field
of
frosted
silver
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
left
the
harbour
of
cherbourg
the
yacht
was
doing
herself
something
like
justice
in
the
matter
of
speed
and
this
contrary
to
all
ethics
of
seamanship
on
such
a
day
at
the
luncheon
table
phinuit
ventured
a
comment
on
this
dangerous
procedure
whereupon
monk
turned
on
him
in
a
cold
fury
as
long
as
i
master
of
this
vessel
sir
i
sail
her
according
to
the
counsels
of
my
own
discretion
and
thank
you
to
keep
your
animadversions
to
yourself
animadversions
phinuit
echoed
and
made
round
shocked
eyes
oh
i
never
at
least
i
did
mean
anything
naughty
skipper
dear
monk
snorted
and
grumbled
over
his
food
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
meal
but
later
coming
upon
a
group
composed
of
liane
delorme
lanyard
and
phinuit
in
the
saloon
he
paused
looked
this
way
and
that
to
make
sure
none
of
the
stewards
was
within
eavesdropping
distance
and
graciously
unbent
a
little
i
making
the
best
time
we
can
while
we
can
see
at
all
he
volunteered
no
telling
when
this
misbegotten
fog
will
close
in
and
force
us
to
slow
down
to
or
less
in
crowded
waters
too
and
very
sensible
i
sure
phinuit
agreed
heartily
whatever
happens
we
mus
be
late
for
our
date
with
friend
boss
must
we
we
keep
it
monk
promised
grimly
if
we
have
to
feel
every
inch
of
our
way
in
with
the
lead
i
do
mind
telling
you
this
fog
may
save
our
skins
at
that
wireless
has
been
picking
up
chatter
all
morning
between
a
regular
school
of
revenue
cutters
patrolling
this
coast
on
the
lookout
for
just
such
idiots
as
we
are
so
we
carry
on
and
trust
to
luck
till
we
make
monk
harbour
or
break
our
fool
necks
liane
delorme
gave
a
start
of
dismay
there
is
danger
then
only
if
we
run
afoul
of
a
cutter
liane
monk
tried
to
speak
reassuringly
and
that
not
likely
in
this
weather
as
for
the
fog
it
a
dirty
nuisance
to
any
navigator
but
as
i
said
may
quite
possibly
prove
our
salvation
i
know
these
waters
like
a
book
sailed
them
ever
since
i
was
old
enough
to
tell
a
tiller
from
a
mainsheet
i
can
smell
my
way
in
if
it
comes
to
that
through
the
blindest
fog
the
atlantic
ever
brewed
then
you
do
things
with
your
nostrils
too
phinuit
enquired
innocently
i
often
wondered
if
all
the
intellect
was
located
in
the
eyebrows
monk
glared
growled
and
hastily
sought
the
air
of
the
deck
liane
delorme
eyed
phinuit
with
amused
reproach
really
my
young
friend
i
ca
help
it
mademoiselle
phinuit
asserted
sulkily
too
much
is
enough
i
watched
him
making
faces
with
the
top
of
his
head
so
long
i
dream
of
geometrical
diagrams
laid
out
in
eyebrows
and
wake
up
screaming
and
they
call
this
a
pleasure
craft
with
an
aggrieved
air
he
sucked
at
his
pipe
for
a
few
minutes
besides
he
added
suddenly
somebody
got
to
be
comic
relief
and
i
do
notice
anybody
else
in
a
sweat
to
be
the
life
and
soul
of
the
ship
he
favoured
lanyard
with
a
morose
stare
why
do
you
ever
put
your
shoulder
to
the
wheel
lanyard
why
leave
it
all
to
me
come
on
be
a
sport
cut
a
caper
crack
a
wheeze
do
something
to
get
a
giggle
but
i
am
by
no
means
sure
you
do
not
laugh
at
me
too
much
as
it
is
rot
tell
you
what
phinuit
sat
up
with
a
gleaming
eye
of
inspiration
you
can
entertain
mademoiselle
and
me
no
end
if
you
like
spill
the
glad
tidings
glad
tidings
now
do
monkey
with
the
eyebrows
it
gives
me
the
willies
i
merely
mean
to
point
out
the
day
you
promised
to
come
through
with
the
awful
decision
and
there
no
use
waiting
for
monk
to
join
us
he
too
much
worried
about
his
nice
little
ship
tell
mademoiselle
and
me
now
lanyard
shook
his
head
smiling
but
the
time
i
set
was
when
we
made
our
landfall
well
what
the
matter
with
martha
vineyard
over
there
you
could
see
if
it
was
a
clear
day
but
it
is
not
a
clear
day
suppose
it
gets
thicker
a
fog
we
may
not
see
land
before
midnight
then
till
midnight
we
must
wait
no
monsieur
phinuit
i
will
not
be
hurried
i
have
been
thinking
i
am
still
thinking
and
there
is
still
much
to
be
said
before
i
can
come
to
any
decision
that
will
be
fair
to
you
mademoiselle
the
captain
on
the
one
hand
myself
on
the
other
but
at
midnight
if
the
skipper
promise
holds
good
we
be
going
ashore
the
objection
is
well
taken
my
answer
will
be
communicated
when
we
see
land
or
at
eleven
whichever
is
the
earlier
event
some
further
effort
at
either
persuasion
or
impudence
nobody
but
phinuit
ever
knew
which
was
drowned
out
by
the
first
bellow
of
the
whistle
sounding
the
fog
signal
liane
delorme
bounded
out
of
her
chair
clapping
hands
to
ears
and
uttered
an
unheard
cry
of
protest
and
when
the
noise
suspending
temporarily
she
learned
that
it
was
to
be
repeated
at
intervals
of
two
minutes
as
long
as
the
fog
lasted
and
the
yacht
was
under
way
she
flung
up
piteous
hands
to
an
uncompassionate
heaven
and
fled
to
her
stateroom
slamming
the
door
as
if
she
thought
thereby
to
shut
out
the
offending
din
one
fancied
something
inhumanly
derisive
in
the
prolonged
hoot
which
replied
rather
than
languish
under
the
burden
of
phinuit
spirited
conversation
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
lanyard
imitated
example
and
wasted
the
next
hour
and
a
half
flat
on
his
bed
with
eyes
closed
but
mind
very
much
alive
now
and
again
he
consulted
his
watch
as
one
might
with
an
important
appointment
to
keep
at
two
minutes
to
four
he
left
his
stateroom
and
as
the
first
stroke
of
eight
bells
rang
out
in
one
of
the
measured
intervals
between
blasts
of
the
whistle
ending
the
afternoon
watch
he
stepped
out
on
deck
and
paused
for
a
survey
of
the
weather
conditions
there
was
no
perceptible
motion
in
the
air
witnessing
that
the
wind
had
come
in
from
astern
that
is
to
say
approximately
from
the
southeast
and
was
blowing
at
about
the
speed
made
by
the
yacht
itself
the
fog
clung
about
the
vessel
lanyard
thought
like
dull
grey
cotton
wool
yet
if
the
shuddering
of
her
fabric
were
fair
criterion
the
pace
of
the
sybarite
was
unabated
she
was
ploughing
headlong
through
that
dense
obscurity
using
the
utmost
power
of
her
engines
from
time
to
time
when
the
whistle
was
still
the
calls
of
seamen
operating
the
sounding
machine
could
be
heard
but
their
reports
were
monotonously
uniform
the
waters
were
not
yet
shoal
enough
for
the
lead
to
find
bottom
at
that
pace
the
watch
was
being
changed
as
lanyard
started
forward
with
the
tail
of
an
eye
on
the
bridge
collison
relieved
swain
and
the
latter
came
down
the
just
in
time
to
save
lanyard
a
nasty
spill
as
his
feet
slipped
on
planking
greasy
with
globules
of
fog
there
no
telling
how
bad
a
fall
he
might
not
have
suffered
had
not
swain
been
there
for
him
to
catch
at
and
for
a
moment
or
two
lanyard
was
as
swain
put
it
with
great
all
over
him
clinging
to
the
first
officer
in
a
most
demonstrative
manner
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
he
at
length
recovered
his
equilibrium
then
however
he
laid
hold
of
the
rail
for
insurance
against
further
mishaps
thanked
swain
heartily
added
his
apologies
and
the
two
parted
with
expressions
of
mutual
esteem
the
incident
seemed
to
have
dampened
lanyard
ardour
for
exercise
he
made
a
rather
gingerly
way
back
to
the
quarterdeck
loafed
restlessly
in
a
for
a
little
while
then
went
below
once
more
some
time
after
supine
again
upon
his
bed
he
heard
swain
in
the
saloon
querulously
interrogating
one
of
the
stewards
it
appeared
that
swain
had
unaccountably
mislaid
his
keys
and
he
wanted
to
know
if
the
steward
had
seen
anything
of
them
the
steward
had
he
said
and
lanyard
for
one
knew
that
he
spake
sooth
since
at
that
moment
the
missing
keys
were
resting
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
several
miles
astern
all
but
one
there
was
no
dressing
for
dinner
that
night
liane
delorme
her
nerves
rasped
almost
beyond
endurance
by
the
relentless
fog
signal
preferred
the
seclusion
of
her
stateroom
lanyard
was
really
sorry
the
bosom
of
a
white
shirt
is
calculated
to
make
some
impression
upon
the
human
retina
even
on
the
darkest
night
whereas
his
plain
lounge
suit
of
blue
serge
was
sure
to
prove
entirely
inconspicuous
so
if
he
missed
the
feminine
influence
at
table
he
bore
up
with
good
fortitude
and
after
dinner
he
segregated
himself
as
usual
in
his
favourite
chair
near
the
taffrail
the
fog
if
anything
denser
than
before
manufactured
an
early
dusk
of
a
peculiarly
depressing
violet
shade
nevertheless
evenings
are
long
in
that
season
of
the
year
and
to
lanyard
it
seemed
that
the
twilight
would
never
quite
fade
out
completely
true
night
would
never
come
long
before
it
did
speed
was
slackened
the
yacht
was
at
last
in
soundings
the
calls
of
the
leadsmen
were
as
monotonous
as
the
whistle
blasts
and
almost
as
frequent
lanyard
could
have
done
without
both
if
the
ship
could
not
he
remarked
a
steadily
intensified
exacerbation
of
nerves
and
told
himself
he
was
growing
old
and
no
mistake
he
could
remember
the
time
when
he
could
have
endured
a
strain
of
waiting
comparable
to
that
which
he
must
suffer
now
and
have
turned
never
a
hair
how
long
ago
it
seemed
another
sign
that
the
sybarite
had
entered
what
are
technically
classified
as
inland
waters
where
special
rules
of
the
road
apply
was
to
be
remarked
in
the
fact
that
the
fog
signal
was
now
roaring
once
each
minute
whereas
lanyard
had
grown
accustomed
to
timing
the
intervals
between
the
sounding
of
the
ship
bell
upon
which
all
his
interest
hung
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
blasts
to
the
half
hour
if
you
asked
him
once
a
minute
seemed
rather
too
much
of
a
good
thing
even
in
busy
lanes
of
sea
traffic
still
it
was
better
perhaps
than
unpremeditated
disaster
one
was
not
keen
about
having
the
sybarite
ground
on
a
sandbank
pile
up
on
a
rock
or
dash
her
brains
out
against
the
bulk
of
another
vessel
before
eleven
at
earliest
in
retrospect
he
counted
those
two
hours
between
dinner
and
longer
than
the
fortnight
which
had
prefaced
them
so
is
the
heart
of
man
ever
impatient
when
the
draws
near
though
that
end
be
but
the
beginning
as
well
of
that
longer
journey
which
men
call
death
lest
he
betray
his
impatience
by
keeping
the
tips
of
his
cigarette
too
bright
one
never
knows
when
one
is
not
watched
he
smoked
sparingly
but
on
the
blare
of
the
whistle
after
the
ringing
of
four
bells
he
drew
out
his
cigarette
case
and
as
the
thirtieth
raved
out
synchronous
with
two
double
strokes
and
a
single
on
brazen
metal
he
placed
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
at
the
same
time
he
saw
captain
monk
who
had
been
on
the
bridge
with
the
officer
of
the
watch
for
several
hours
come
aft
with
weary
shoulders
sagging
and
go
below
by
the
saloon
companionway
and
lanyard
smiled
knowingly
and
assured
himself
that
went
well
ça
va
bien
his
star
held
still
in
the
ascendant
there
remained
on
the
bridge
only
collison
and
the
man
at
the
wheel
at
the
fourth
blast
after
five
bells
lanyard
put
a
match
to
his
cigarette
but
he
did
not
puff
more
than
to
get
the
tobacco
well
alight
he
even
held
his
breath
and
felt
his
body
shaken
by
the
pulsations
of
his
anxious
heart
precisely
as
the
body
of
the
sybarite
was
shaken
by
the
pulsations
of
her
engines
with
the
next
succeeding
fog
signal
darkness
absolute
descended
upon
the
vessel
shrouding
it
from
stem
to
stern
like
a
vast
blanket
of
blackness
mussey
had
not
failed
to
keep
his
pact
of
treachery
lanyard
was
out
of
his
chair
before
the
first
call
of
excited
remonstrance
rang
out
on
deck
to
be
echoed
in
clamour
his
cigarette
stopped
behind
on
the
taffrail
carefully
placed
at
precisely
the
height
of
his
head
its
little
glowing
tip
the
only
spot
of
light
on
the
decks
no
matter
whether
or
not
it
were
noted
no
precaution
is
too
insignificant
to
be
important
when
life
and
death
are
at
issue
there
was
nothing
of
that
afternoon
unsureness
of
foot
in
the
way
lanyard
moved
forward
passing
the
ventilators
he
heard
the
telegraph
give
a
single
stroke
collison
had
only
then
recovered
from
his
astonishment
sufficiently
to
signal
to
slow
down
a
squeal
of
the
whistle
followed
instantly
and
lanyard
set
foot
upon
the
bridge
in
time
to
hear
collison
demanding
to
know
what
the
sanguinary
hades
had
happened
down
there
whatever
reply
he
got
seemed
to
exasperate
him
into
incoherence
he
stuttered
with
rage
gasped
and
addressed
the
man
at
the
wheel
i
got
a
in
my
cabin
that

retreating
footsteps
were
just
audible
neither
speaker
had
been
visible
to

by
putting
out
a
hand
he
could
have
touched
the
helmsman
but
his
body
made
not
even
the
shadow
of
a
silhouette
against
the
sky
the
fog
was
rendering
the
night
the
simple
and
unqualified
negation
of

in
that
time
of
stygian
gloom
violence

done
swiftly
surely
and
without

with

with

was
sorry
for

at

what
was
to
be
done
could
not
be
done
in
any
other

the
surprise
aided
him
for
the
fellow
offered
barely
a
show
of
opposition
his
astounded
faculties
had
no
more
than
recognised
the
call
for
resistance
when
he
was
powerless
in
lanyard
hands
swung
bodily
away
from

he
went
over
the

to
the
forward

of

turned
to
the

the

saved
from

which
swain
had
so
unfortunately
and
unaccountably
lost
opened
the

the

of

that
swain
had
used
under

when

a

into

for

in

and
one
by

removed
and
dropped
them
to
the
grating
at
the
foot
of
the
binnacle
he
worked
with
hands
amazingly
nimble
and
sure
and
was
closing
and
relocking
the
door
when
collison
tumbled
up
the
ladder
with
his
so
when
the
second
mate
arrived
upon
the

lanyard
was
waiting
for
him
and
in
consequence
of
a
second
act
of
deplorable
violence
collison
returned
to
the
deck
backwards
and
lay
quite
still
while
lanyard
returned
to
the

collecting
the
abstracted
magnets
he
carried
them
to
the
rail
cast
them
into
the
sea
and
threw
in
the

to
the
little
door
to
keep
them
company
then
back
at
the
binnacle
he
unscrewed
the
brass

of

cylindrical
brass
tube
which

also
replaced
the

consigned
the

by
choice
he
would
have
made
a
good

of
it
and
abolished

he
judged
he

done

to
secure
his

it
was

now
to

the

however
he
was
on
his

again
a
beam
of
light
had
swept
across
the
saloon
skylight
coming
from
below
the
beam
of
a
portable
electric
torch
it
might
have
been
the
signal
for
the
first
piercing
scream
of
liane

a
pistol
shot
with
a
vicious
accent
cut
short
the
scream
after
a
brief
pause
several
more
shots
rippled
in
the
saloon
a
man
shouted
angrily
then
the
found
and
steadied
upon
the
mouth
of
the
companionway
against
that
glare
a
burly
figure
was
instantaneously
relieved
running
up
to
the
deck
as
it
gained
the
topmost
step
a
final
report
sounded
in
the
saloon
and
the
figure
checked
revolved
slowly
on
a
heel
tottered
and
plunged
headforemost
down
the
steps
again
a
moment
later
incredible
that
the
stipulated
ten
minutes
should
have
passed
so
swiftly
the

came
on

with
a

of

clawing
her

her

widely
dilate
with

agape

as
by

mechanical

flat
and
meaningless

no

the

and

and
even
as

looked
the
huge
body
of
the
creature
lifted
from
the
floor
in

last
heroic
spasm

collapsed
and
moved

this
hideous
tableau

what
it
meant
that
popinot

with

outside

across

planted
himself
squarely
in

of

seizing
her

with
his

hands
he
used

to
drag
them
down
to
the

strong

his

deep
into

staring

into

a

for
an
instant
with
a
look
of
confusion
then
her
lashes
drooped
her
body
relaxed
she
fell
limply
against
the

was

fits

you
lanyard

our

i

you

you
be

enough
to
fetch
me
that
carafe

if
we

bring
the

such
as
they

his
tone
was
sufficiently
urgent
to
rouse
liane
out
of
the
lassitude
into
which
reaction
from
terror
had
let
her
slip
she
passed
a
hand
over
still
dazed
eyes
looked
uncertainly
about
then
with
perceptible
exertion
of
will
power
collected
herself
stood
away
from
the
partition
and
picked
up
the
carafe
lanyard
adopted
the
sensible
suggestion
of
phinuit
dropping
on
a
knee
to
rest
his
hand
above
the
heart
of
popinot
to
his
complete
satisfaction
if
not
at
all
to
his
surprise
no
least
flutter
of
life
was
to
be
detected
in
that
chest
a
moment
longer
he
lingered
looking
the
corpse
over
with
inquisitive
eyes
no
sign
that
he
could
see
suggested
that
popinot
had
suffered
hardship
during
his
two
weeks
of
close
sequestration
he
seemed
to
have
fared
well
as
to
food
and
drink
and
his
clothing
if
nothing
to
boast
of
in
respect
of
cut
or
cloth
and
though
wrinkled
and
stretched
with
constant
wear
was
tolerably
clean
unstained
by
bilge
grease
or
coal
smuts
as
it
must
have
been
had
the
man
been
hiding
in
the
hold
or
bunkers
those
traditional
refuges
of
your
stowaway
no
monsieur
popinot
had
been
well
taken
care
of
and
lanyard
could
name
an
officer
of
prestige
ponderable
enough
to
secure
his
quarters
wherein
presumably
popinot
had
lain
perdu
against
search
when
the
yacht
has
been
turned
inside
out
according
to
its
commander
so
this
was
the
source
of
mussey
exact
understanding
of
the
business
as
to
the
question
of
how
the
apache
had
been
smuggled
aboard
and
when
lanyard
never
learned
the
truth
circumstances
were
to
prevent
his
interrogating
mussey
and
he
could
only
assume
that
since
popinot
could
hardly
have
been
in
the
motor
car
wrecked
on
the
road
from
paris
he
must
have
left
that
pursuit
to
trusted
confrères
and
anticipating
their
possible
failure
have
hurried
on
to
cherbourg
by
another
route
to
make
precautionary
arrangements
with
mussey
ah
well
no
fault
could
be
found
with
the
fellow
for
lack
of
determination
and
tenacity
on
the
point
of
rising
lanyard
reconsidered
and
bending
over
the
body
ran
clever
hands
rapidly
through
the
clothing
turning
out
every
pocket
and
heaping
the
miscellany
of
rubbish
thus
brought
to
light
upon
the
floor
with
a
single
exception
popinot
had
possessed
a
pistol
an
excellent
automatic
why
he
had
used
it
to
protect
himself
heaven
only
knew
presumably
he
had
been
too
thoroughly
engrossed
in
the
exercise
of
his
favourite
sport
to
think
of
the
weapon
up
to
the
time
when
phinuit
had
opened
fire
on
him
and
then
thrown
into
panic
he
had
been
able
to
entertain
one
thought
only
that
of
escape
lanyard
entertained
for
a
moment
a
vivid
imaginary
picture
of
the
scene
in
the
saloon
when
phinuit
had
surprised
the
apache
in
the
act
of
strangling
monk
a
picture
that
phinuit
subsequently
confirmed
substantially
in
every
detail
one
saw
the
garroter
creeping
through
the
blackness
of
the
saloon
from
his
hiding
place
forward
in
the
cabin
of
the
chief
engineer
stationing
himself
at
the
door
to
monk
quarters
with
his
chosen
weapon
that
deadly
handkerchief
of
his
trade
ready
for
the
throat
of
the
lone
wolf
when
he
should
emerge
in
accordance
with
his
agreement
with
mussey
the
spoils
of
the
captain
safe
in
his
hands
then
one
saw
monk
alarmed
by
the
sudden
failure
of
the
lights
hurrying
out
to
return
to
the
bridge
the
pantherish
spring
upon
the
victim
back
the
swift
dextrous
noosing
of
the
handkerchief
about
his
windpipe
the
merciless
tightening
of
it
all
abruptly
illuminated
by
the
white
glare
of
phinuit
electric
torch
and
then
the
truncated
crimson
of
the
first
pistol
flash
the
frantic
effort
to
escape
the
hunting
of
that
gross
shape
of
flesh
by
the
beam
of
light
and
the
bullets
as
popinot
doubled
and
twisted
round
the
saloon
like
a
rat
in
a
pit
the
last
mad
plunge
for
the
companionway
the
flight
up
its
steps
that

narrowest
margin

too
busy
to
heed

lanyard
slipped
the
pistol
into
a
pocket
and
got
to
his
feet
then
swain
came
charging
down
the
steps
to
find
out
what
all
the
row
was
about
and
to
report
which
he
did
as
soon
as
monk
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
understand
those
outrageous
and
darkly
mysterious
assaults
upon
the
helmsman
and
collison
both
men
he
stated
were
unfit
for
further
duty
that
night
though
neither
lanyard
was
happy
to
learn
had
suffered
any
permanent
injury
but
what
in
the
name
of
insanity
could
have
inspired
such
a
meaningless
atrocity
what
could
its
perpetrator
have
hoped
to
gain
what
monk
stretched
out
upon
a
leather
couch
in
his
levelled
eyebrows
of
suspicion
at
lanyard
who
countered
with
a
guilelessness
so
perfect
as
to
make
it
appear
that
he
did
not
even
comprehend
the
insinuation
if
i
may
offer
a
suggestion
he
said
with
becoming
diffidence
well
monk
demanded
with
a
snap
despite
his
languors
what
on
your
mind
it
would
seem
to
a
benevolent
neutral
like
myself
you
understand
i
was
in
my
by
the
taffrail
throughout
all
this
affair
the
men
at
the
sounding
machine
nearby
can
tell
you
i
did
not
move
before
the
shots
in
the
saloon
how
the
devil
could
they
know
that
in
the
dark
i
was
smoking
monsieur
they
must
if
they
looked
have
seen
the
fire
of
my
cigarette
as
i
was
about
to
suggest
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
must
be
some
obscure
but
not
necessarily
unfathomable
connection
between
the
three
events
else
how
should
they
synchronise
so
perfectly
how
did
popinot
know
the
lights
would
go
out
a
few
minutes
after
five
bells
he
was
prepared
he
lost
no

how
did

he
was

it

be
safe
to
commit
that
wickedness
whatever
its
purpose
upon
the

at
precisely
that
time
for
plainly
he
too
was
prepared
to
act
upon
the
instant
that
is
if
i
understand

report
correctly
and
how
did
it
happen
that
the

went
out
of

just
then
what

in

anybody
know
i
think

if
you
find
out
the
answer
to
that
last
question
you
will
have
gone
some
way
toward
solving
your
mystery

to

up
again
their

a
sly
eye
at

was
cheered
to

that
his
labours
at
the
binnacle

fruit

so
busy
being
an
invalid

upon

pitied
by

to

voices
as

away
all
that
was
mortal
of
monsieur
popinot
between
roars
of
the
fog
signal
six
bells
vibrated
on
the
air
phinuit
cocked
his
head
intelligently
to
one
side
ransacked
his
memory
and
looked
brightly
to
lanyard
he
murmured
the
fatal
hour
lanyard
gave
him
a
gracious
smile
in
attenuated
accents
captain
monk
without
opening
his
eyes
or
stirring
under
the
caresses
of
that
lovely
hand
enquired
what
say
phin
i
was
just
reminding
monsieur
lanyard
the
fatal
hour
has
struck
old
thing
the
eyebrows
knitted
in
painful
effort
to
understand
when
one
has
narrowly
escaped
death
by
strangulation
one
may
be
pardoned
some
slight
mental
haziness
besides
it
makes
to
retain
sympathy
not
to
be
too
confoundedly
fatal
hour
the
dear
man
promised
to
turn
in
his
answer
to
our
unselfish
little
proposition
at
six
bells
and
not
later
really
the
voice
was
interested
and
so
were
the
eyebrows
but
monk
was
at
pains
not
to
move
and
has
he
not
yet
old
egg
monk
opened
expectant
eyes
and
fixed
them
upon
lanyard
face
the
eyebrows
acquiring
a
slant
of
amiable
enquiry
there
is
much
to
be
said
lanyard
temporised
that
is
if
you
feel
strong
enough
oh
quite
monk
assured
him
in
tones
barely
audible
must
it
be
a
blow
to
the
poor
dear
phinuit
enquired
i
hope
not
very
truly
the
now
betrayed
a
course
had
the
binnacle
compass
then
gone
out
of
its
head
altogether
on
finding
itself
bereft
of
its
accustomed
court
of
well
here
we
all
are
sitting
forward
on
the
edges
of
our
chairs
holding
onto
the
seats
with
both
hands
ears
pricked
forward
eyes
shining
the
suspense
phinuit
avowed
is
something
fierce
i
am
sorry
what
mean
you
sorry
you
not
going
to
back
out
having
never
walked
into
the
arrangement
you
propose
it
would
be
difficult
to
back
out
would
it
not
monk
forgot
that
he
was
suffering
acutely
forgot
even
the
beautiful
and
precious
hand
that
was
soothing
his
fevered
brow
and
rudely
shaking
it
off
sat
up
suddenly
the
eyebrows
were
distinctly
minatory
above
eyes
that
loosed
ugly
gleams
you
refuse
lanyard
slowly
inclined
his
head
i
regret
i
must
beg
to
be
excused
you
damned
fool
pardon
monsieur
a
look
of
fury
convulsed
liane
face
phinuit
too
was
glaring
no
longer
a
humourist
monk
mouth
was
working
and
his
eyebrows
had
got
out
of
hand
altogether
i
said
you
were
a
damned
fool
but
is
not
that
a
matter
of
personal
viewpoint
at
least
the
question
would
seem
to
be
open
to
debate
if
you
think
arguments
will
satisfy
us
but
my
dear
captain
monk
i
am
really
not
at
all
concerned
to
satisfy
you
however
if
you
wish
to
know
my
reasons
for
declining
the
honour
you
would
thrust
upon
me
they
are
at
your
service
i
be
glad
to
hear
them
said
monk
grimly
one
i
fancy
will
do
as
well
as
a
dozen
it
is
then
my
considered
judgment
that
were
i
in
the
least
inclined
to
resume
the
evil
ways
of
my
past
as
i
am
not
i
would
be
as
you
so
vividly
put
it
a
damned
fool
to
associate
myself
with
people
of
a
low
grade
of
intelligence
wanting
even
enough
to
hold
fast
that
which
they
have
thieved
by
god
monk
brought
down
a
thumping
fist
what
are
you
getting
at
your
hopeless
inefficiency
monsieur
forgive
my
bluntness
come
through
phinuit
advised
in
a
dangerous
voice
just
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
you
knowing
i
have
but
one
object
in
submitting
to
association
with
you
in
any
way
to
wit
the
recovery
of
the
jewels
of
madame
de
montalais
and
their
restoration
to
that
lady
have
not
had
sufficient
wit
to
prevent
my
securing
those
jewels
under
your
very
noses
you
mean
to
say
you
stolen
them
lanyard
nodded
they
are
at
present
in
my
possession
if
that
confesses
an
act
of
theft
monk
laughed
discordantly
then
i
say
you
a
liar
monsieur
the
lone
wolf
as
well
as
a
fool
his
fist
smote
the
desk
again
the
montalais
jewels
are
here
lanyard
shrugged
when
did
you
lift
them
phinuit
demanded
with
sarcasm
tell
us
that
lanyard
smiled
an
exasperating
smile
lounged
low
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
the
deck
beams
taking
occasion
to
note
that
the
had
swung
to
true
northwest
ça
va
bien
why
you
insane
impostor
monk
stormed
i
had
that
box
in
my
own
hands
no
later
than
this
afternoon
without
moving
lanyard
directed
his
voice
toward
the
ceiling
did
you
by
any
chance
open
it
and
see
what
was
inside
there
was
no
answer
and
though
he
was
careful
not
to
betray
any
interest
by
watching
them
he
was
well
aware
that
looks
of
alarm
and
suspicion
were
being
exchanged
by
those
three
so
much
for
enjoying
the
prestige
of
a
stupendously
successful
criminal
past
a
single
thought
was
in
the
mind
of
liane
delorme
captain
monk
and
phinuit
with
the
lone
wolf
nothing
was
impossible
liane
delorme
said
abruptly
in
a
choking
voice
open
the
safe
please
captain
monk
i
do
nothing
of
the
sort
go
on
phinuit
advised
make
sure
if
it
true
we
get
them
back
do
we
if
it
is
we
show
him
up
for
a
pitiful
bluff
it
a
dodge
monk
declared
to
get
the
jewels
where
he
can
lay
hands
on
them
the
safe
stays
shut
open
it
i
beg
you
liane
implored
in
tremulous
accents
no
why
not
phinuit
argued
what
can
he
do
i
got
him
covered
and
i
lanyard
interjected
softly
as
you
all
know
am
unarmed
please
liane
insisted
there
was
a
pause
which
ended
in
a
sullen
grunt
from
monk
lanyard
smiled
cheerfully
and
sat
up
in
his
chair
watching
the
captain
while
he
unlocked
the
door
in
the
pedestal
and
with
shaking
fingers
manipulated
the
combination
dial
liane
delorme
left
her
chair
to
stand
nearby
in
undissembled
anxiety
only
phinuit
remained
as
he
had
been
lounging
back
and
watching
lanyard
narrowly
his
automatic
pistol
dangling
between
his
knees
lanyard
offered
him
a
pleasant
smile
phinuit
scowled
forbiddingly
in
response
monk
swung
open
the
seized
the
metal
by
the
handle
and
set
it
upon
the
desk
with
a
bang
then
extracting
his
pocket
he
selected
the
proper
key
and
made
several
attempts
to
insert
it
in
the
slot
of
the
lock
but
his
confidence
was
so
shaken
his
morale
so
impaired
by
lanyard
sublime
effrontery
added
to
his
recent
shocking
experience
that
the
gaunt
hands
trembled
beyond
his
control
and
it
was
several
seconds
before
he
succeeded
lanyard
gave
no
sign
but
his
heart
sank
he
had
exhausted
his
last
resource
to
gain
time
he
was
now
at
his
wits
ends
only
his
star
could
save
him
now
monk
turned
the
keys
but
all
at
once
forgot
his
purpose
and
with
hands
stayed
upon
the
lid
of
the
box
paused
and
cocked
his
ears
attentively
to
rumours
of
excitement
and
confusion
on
the
deck
the
instinct
of
the
seafaring
man
uppermost
monk
stiffened
grew
rigid
from
head
to
foot
one
heard
hurried
feet
outcries
a
sudden
jangle
of
the
telegraph
monsieur
monsieur
liane
implored
open
that
box
the
words
were
on
her
lips
when
she
was
thrown
off
her
feet
by
a
frightful
shock
which
stopped
the
sybarite
dead
in
full
career
before
the
screw
reversed
in
obedience
to
the
telegraph
could
grip
the
water
and
lessen
her
momentum
the
woman
cannoned
against
monk
shouldering
him
bodily
aside
instinctively
snatching
at
the
box
monk
succeeded
only
in
dragging
it
to
the
edge
of
the
desk
before
a
second
shock
accompanied
by
a
grinding
crash
of
steel
and
timbers
seemed
to
make
the
yacht
leap
like
a
live
thing
stricken
mortally
she
heeled
heavily
to
starboard
the
went
to
the
floor
with
a
thump
lost
in
the
greater
din
liane
delorme
was
propelled
headlong
into
a
corner
monk
thrown
to
his
knees
phinuit
lifted
out
of
his
chair
and
flung
sprawling
into
the
arms
of
lanyard
who
pinned
down
by
the
weight
in
his
own
chair
felt
this
last
slide
backwards
to
starboard
and
bring
up
against
a
partition
with
a
bang
that
drove
the
breath
out
of
him
in
one
enormous
gust
he
retained
however
sufficient
presence
of
mind
neatly
to
disarm
phinuit
before
that
one
guessed
what
he
was
about
after
that
second
blow
the
sybarite
remained
at
a
standstill
but
the
continued
beating
of
her
engines
caused
her
to
quiver
painfully
from
trucks
to
keelson
as
if
in
agonies
of
death
such
as
those
which
had
marked
the
end
of
popinot
of
a
sudden
the
engines
ceased
and
there
was
no
more
movement
of
any
sort
only
an
appalling
repose
with
silence
more
dreadful
still
lanyard
had
no
means
to
measure
how
long
that
dumb
suspense
lasted
which
was
imposed
by
the
stunned
faculties
of
all
on
board
it
seemed
interminable
eventually
he
saw
monk
pick
himself
up
and
making
strange
moaning
noises
like
a
wounded
animal
throw
himself
upon
the
door
jerk
it
open
and
dash
out
as
if
he
had
only
needed
that
vision
of
action
to
animate
him
lanyard
threw
phinuit
off
so
that
he
staggered
across
the
slanting
floor
toward
the
door
when
he
brought
himself
up
by
catching
hold
of
its
frame
he
was
under
the
threat
of
his
own
pistol
in
lanyard
hands
he
lingered
for
a
moment
showing
lanyard
a
distraught
and
vacant
face
then
apparently
realising
his
danger
faded
away
into
the
saloon
with
a
roughness
dictated
by
the
desperate
extremity
lanyard
strode
over
to
liane
delorme
where
she
still
crouched
in
her
corner
staring
witlessly
caught
her
by
one
arm
fairly
jerked
her
to
her
feet
and
thrust
her
stumbling
out
into
the
saloon
closing
the
door
behind
her
he
shot
its
bolts
he
went
to
work
swiftly
then
in
a
fever
of
haste
in
his
ears
the
clamour
of
the
shipwrecked
men
upon
the
decks
was
only
a
distant
droning
hardly
recognised
for
what
it
was
by
him
who
had
not
one
thought
other
than
to
make
all
possible
advantage
of
every
precious
instant
and
so
with
the
roar
of
steam
from
the
stripping
off
coat
and
waistcoat
he
took
from
the
pocket
of
the
latter
the
wallet
that
held
his
papers
then
ripped
open
his
shirt
and
unbuckled
the
money
belt
round
his
waist
its
pockets
were
ample
and
fitted
with
trustworthy
fastenings
and
all
but
one
that
held
a
few
english
sovereigns
were
empty
the
jewels
of
madame
de
montalais
went
into
them
as
rapidly
as
his
fingers
could
move
thus
engaged
he
heard
a
pistol
explode
in
the
saloon
and
saw
the
polished
of
the
captain
desk
scored
by
a
bullet
his
gaze
shifting
to
the
door
he
discovered
a
neat
round
hole
in
one
of
its
rosewood
panels
at
the
same
time
to
the
tune
of
another
report
a
second
hole
appeared
and
the
bullet
winging
above
the
desk
buried
itself
in
the
between
the
a
stream
of
bullets
followed
one
after
another
boring
the
stout
panels
as
if
their
consistency
had
been
that
of
cheese
lanyard
stepped
out
of
their
path
and
hugged
the
partition
while
he
finished
stuffing
the
jewels
into
the
belt
and
placing
the
thin
wallet
beneath
it
strapped
it
tightly
round
him
once
more
that
would
be
phinuit
out
there
no
doubt
disdaining
to
waste
time
breaking
in
the
door
or
perhaps
fearing
his
reception
once
it
was
down
an
innocent
and
harmless
amusement
if
he
enjoyed
it
that
it
seemed
a
pity
to
interrupt
at
the
same
time
it
grew
annoying
the
door
was
taking
on
the
look
of
a
sieve
and
the
neighbourhood
of
the
deadlights
lanyard
sole
avenue
of
escape
was
being
well
peppered
something
would
have
to
be
done
about
it
lanyard
completed
his
preparations
by
kicking
off
his
shoes
and
taking
up
another
notch
in
the
belt
that
supported
his
trousers
if
the
swim
before
him
proved
a
long
one
he
could
get
rid
of
his
garments
in
the
water
readily
enough
if
on
the
other
hand
the
shore
proved
to
be
close
at
hand
it
would
be
more
convenable
to
land
at
least
half
clothed
then
the
fusillade
continuing
without
intermission
save
when
the
man
outside
stopped
long
enough
to
extract
an
empty
clip
and
replace
it
with
one
loaded
lanyard
edged
along
the
partition
to
the
door
calculated
the
stand
of
the
lunatic
in
the
saloon
from
the
angle
at
which
the
bullets
were
coming
through
and
emptied
the
pistol
he
had
taken
from
phinuit
at
the
panels
as
fast
as
he
could
pull
trigger
there
was
no
more
firing
he
tossed
aside
the
empty
weapon
made
sure
of
popinot
on
his
hip
approached
one
of
the
deadlights
placed
a
chair
climbed
upon
it
and
with
infinite
pains
managed
to
wriggle
and
squirm
head
and
shoulders
through
the
opening
it
was
very
fortunate
for
him
indeed
that
the
sybarite
happened
to
have
been
built
for
pleasure
yachting
with
deadlights
uncommonly
large
for
the
sake
of
air
and
light
else
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
run
the
risk
of
opening
the
door
to
the
saloon
and
fighting
his
way
out
and
up
to
the
deck
as
it
was
the
business
was
difficult
enough
he
had
to
work
one
of
his
arms
out
after
his
shoulders
and
then
twisting
round
strain
and
claw
at
the
smooth
overhang
of
the
stern
until
able
to
catch
the
outer
lip
of
the
scuppers
above
after
that
he
had
to
lift
and
drag
the
rest
of
him
out
through
the
deadlight
and
hanging
by
fingertips
work
his
way
round
inch
by
inch
until
it
seemed
possible
to
drop
into
the
sea
and
escape
hitting
the
screw
in
point
of
fact
he
barely
missed
splitting
himself
in
two
on
the
thing
and
on
coming
to
the
surface
clung
to
it
while
taking
such
observations
as
one
might
in
that
befogged
blackness
impossible
to
guess
which
way
to
strike
out
the
fog
hung
low
upon
the
water
greying
its
smooth
gently
heaving
black
surface
he
could
see
nothing
on
either
beam
at
length
however
he
heard
through
the
hissing
uproar
of
escaping
steam
a
mournful
bell
somewhere
off
to
port
which
he
at
first
took
for
a
buoy
then
perceived
to
be
tolling
with
a
regularity
inconsistent
with
the
eccentric
action
of
waves
timed
by
pulsebeats
it
struck
once
every
fifteen
seconds
or
thereabouts
undoubtedly
the
fog
signal
of
some
minor
in
confirmation
of
this
conclusion
lanyard
heard
from
the
deck
above
the
resonant
accents
of
captain
monk
clearly
articulate
in
that
riot
of
voices
apparently
storming
at
hapless
swain

you
hear
that
bell

you
what

on
the

off

eastern
end

far
off

he
have

let
go
the
bronze
blade
and
struck
out
for
the
melancholy
bell
ten
minutes
later
the
fingers
of
one
hand
he
was
swimming
on
his
side
at
the
bottom
of
its
stroke

pebbles
he
lowered
his
feet
and
waded
through
extensive
shallows
to

wide
and
sandy

the

of

his

at
the
walpole

high
in

a
southward
vista
of
fifth

enchantment
clothed
in
ever
changing
guises
of
light
and
shade
was
so
potent
that

on
the
first
day
of
his
tenancy

it
could
never
tire
yet
by
noon
of
the

was
viewing
it
with
the
eyes
of
ennui
though
the
disfavour
it
had
so
quickly
won
in
his
sight
was
he
knew
due
less
to
cloying
familiarity
than
to
the
uncertainty
and
discontent
that
were
eating
out
his
heart
three
days
before

on

to
the
latter
a
cheerful
request
that
credit
be
arranged
for
him
by
cable
was
as
prompt
and
satisfactory
as
he
had
expected
it
to
be
but
from
madame
de
montalais
he
heard
nothing
mission
successful
he
had
wired
returning
france
by
la
savoie
in
five
days
having
arranged
safe
transportation
your
property
please
advise
if
you
can
meet
me
in
paris
to
receive
same
or
your
commands
otherwise
and
to
this
silence
only
silence
to
him
to
whom
words
of
her
dictation
however
few
and
terse
and
filtered
through
no
matter
how
many
indifferent
mediums
of
intelligence
would
have
been
precious
beyond
expression
so
it
was
that
as
hour
followed
hour
and
the
tale
of
them
lengthened
into
days
he
fell
into
a
temper
of
morbid
brooding
that
was
little
like
the
man
and
instead
of
faring
abroad
and
seeking
what
amusement
he
might
find
in
the
most
carefree
city
of
the
world
shut
himself
up
in
his
rooms
and
moped
indifferent
to
all
things
but
the
knocks
at
his
door
the
stridulation
of
the
telephone
bell
that
might
announce
the
arrival
of
the
desired
message
and
so
it
was
that
when
the
telephone
did
ring
at
last
towards
noon
of
that
third
day
he
fairly
stumbled
over
himself
in
his
haste
to
reach
the
instrument
but
the
animation
with
which
he
answered
the
professional
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
faded
very
quickly
the
look
of
weariness
returned
his
accents
voiced
an
indifference
fairly
desolating
yes
oh
yes
very
well
yes
at
once
he
returned
to
his
view
from
the
window
and
was
hating
it
with
all
his
heart
when
a
stout
knuckling
on
his
door
announced
his
callers
they
filed
into
the
room
with
a
cheerfulness
of
mien
in
striking
contrast
to
the
weary
courtesy
with
which
lanyard
received
them
liane
delorme
first
then
monk
then
phinuit
rather
bleached
of
colour
and
wearing
one
arm
in
a
sling
all
very
smart
in
clothes
conspicuously
new
and
as
costly
as
the
avenue
afforded
striking
figures
of
contentment
in
prosperity
it
is
a
pleasure
indeed
lanyard
gravely
acknowledged
their
several
salutations
not
i
must
confess
altogether
unexpected
but
a
pleasure
none
the
less
so
you
did
think
we
be
long
spotting
you
in
the
good
little
old
town
phinuit
enquired
had
a
notion
you
thought
the
best
way
to
lose
us
would
be
to
put
up
at
this
home
of
the
highest
prices
no
lanyard
replied
i
never
thought
to
be
rid
of
you
without
one
more
meeting
then
there
good
in
the
old
bean
yet
phinuit
interrupted
in
wasted
irony
one
cherishes
that
hope
monsieur
the
trail
i
left
for
you
to
follow
i
would
be
an
ass
indeed
if
i
thought
you
would
fail
to
find
it
when
one
borrows
a
rowboat
at
plum
island
light
without
asking
permission
government
property
too
and
leaves
it
moored
to
a
dock
on
the
greenport
waterfront
when
one
arrives
in
greenport
clothed
in
shirt
and
trousers
only
and
has
to
bribe
its
pardonably
suspicious
inhabitants
with
handfuls
of
british
gold
which
they
are
the
more
loath
to
accept
in
view
of
its
present
depreciation
in
order
to
secure
a
slopchest
coat
and
shoes
and
transportation
by
railway
to
new
york
when
a
taxicab
chauffeur
refuses
a
sovereign
for
his
fare
from
the
pennsylvania
station
to
this
hotel
and
one
is
constrained
to
borrow
from
the
management
why
i
should
say
the
trail
was
fairly
broad
and
well
blazed
mes
amis
be
that
as
it
may
said
phinuit
here
in
a
manner
of
speaking
we
all
are
at
least
the
happy
family
reunited
and
ready
to
talk
business
and
no
hard
feelings
monsieur
phinuit
there
will
be
none
monk
eyebrows
were
at
once
sardonic
and
which
speaks
volumes
for
their
versatility
at
least
none
on
our
side
when
we
are
finished
that
makes
me
more
happy
still
and
you
liane
the
woman
gave
a
negligent
movement
of
pretty
shoulders
one
begins
to
see
how
very
right
you
are
michael
she
said
wearily
and
always
were
for
that
matter
if
one
wishes
to
do
wrong
one
should
do
it
all
alone
and
escape
being
bored
to
death
by
the
oh
the
unpardonable
stupidity
of
associates
but
no
messieurs
she
insisted
with
temper
as
monk
and
phinuit
simultaneously
flew
signals
of
resentment
i
mean
what
i
say
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
any
of
you
i
am
sick
of
you
all
what
did
i
tell
you
when
you
insisted
on
coming
here
to
see
monsieur
lanyard
that
you
would
gain
nothing
and
perhaps
lose
much
but
you
would
not
listen
to
me
you
found
it
impossible
to
believe
there
could
be
in
all
the
world
a
man
who
keeps
his
word
not
only
to
others
but
to
himself
you
are
so
lost
in
admiration
of
your
own
cleverness
in
backing
that
poor
little
ship
off
the
rocks
and
letting
her
fill
and
sink
so
that
there
could
be
no
evidence
of
against
you
that
you
must
try
to
prove
your
wits
once
more
where
they
have
always
failed
she
illustrated
with
a
dramatic
gesture
against
his
you
say
to
yourselves
since
we
are
wrong
he
must
be
wrong
and
since
that
is
now
clearly
proved
that
he
is
as
wrong
in
every
way
as
we
then
it
follows
naturally
that
he
will
heed
our
threats
and
surrender
to
us
those
jewels
those
jewels
she
declared
bitterly
which
we
would
have
been
fortunate
never
to
have
heard
of
she
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
and
showed
them
a
scornful
shoulder
compressing
indignant
lips
to
a
straight
unlovely
line
and
beating
out
the
devil
tattoo
with
her
slipper
lanyard
watched
her
with
a
puzzled
smile
how
much
of
this
was
acting
how
much
if
anything
an
expression
of
true
feeling
was
she
actually
persuaded
it
was
waste
of
time
to
contend
against
him
or
was
she
shrewdly
playing
upon
his
not
unfriendly
disposition
toward
her
in
the
hope
that
it
would
spare
her
in
the
hour
of
the
grand
débâcle
he
could
be
sure
of
one
thing
only
since
she
was
a
woman
he
would
never
know
monk
had
been
making
ominous
motions
with
the
eyebrows
but
phinuit
made
haste
to
be
beforehand
with
him
you
said
one
thing
mademoiselle
one
thing
anyway
that
meant
something
that
monsieur
lanyard
would
give
up
those
jewels
to
us
that
all
arranged
lanyard
turned
to
him
with
genuine
amusement
indeed
monsieur
indeed
and
everything
we
do
want
to
pull
any
rough
stuff
on
you
lanyard
and
we
wo
unless
you
force
us
to
rough
stuff
monsieur
you
mean
physical
force
not
exactly
but
i
think
you
recall
my
telling
you
i
stand
in
well
with
the
police
department
in
the
old
home
town
maybe
you
thought
that
was
swank
likely
you
did
but
it
was
i
got
a
couple
of
friends
of
mine
from
headquarters
waiting
downstairs
this
very
minute
ready
and
willing
to
cop
out
the
honour
of
putting
the
lone
wolf
under
arrest
for
stealing
the
montalais
jewels
but
is
it
possible
lanyard
protested
you
still
do
not
understand
me
is
it
possible
you
still
believe
i
am
a
thief
at
heart
and
interested
in
those
jewels
only
to
turn
them
to
my
own
profit
he
stared
unbelievingly
at
the
frosty
eyes
of
monk
beneath
their
fatuously
stubborn
brows
at
the
hard
unyielding
eyes
of
phinuit
you
said
it
this
last
replied
with
brevity
it
was
a
good
bluff
while
it
lasted
monsieur
lanyard
monk
added
but
it
could
last
forever
you
ca
get
away
with
it
why
not
give
in
gracefully
admit
you
licked
for
once
be
a
good
fellow
my
god
lanyard
pronounced
in
comic
despair
it
passes
understanding
it
is
true
then
and
true
especially
of
such
as
you
are
as
i
was
in
my
yesterday
that
fortune
wishes
to
destroy
she
first
makes
mad
for
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
you
seem
to
me
quite
mad
messieurs
too
mad
to
be
allowed
at
large
and
in
proof
of
my
sincerity
i
propose
that
you
shall
not
longer
remain
at
large
what
that
monk
demanded
startled
why
you
have
not
hesitated
to
threaten
me
with
the
police
so
now
i
in
my
turn
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
that
anticipating
this
call
i
have
had
relays
of
detectives
waiting
in
this
hotel
day
and
night
with
instructions
to
guard
the
doors
as
soon
as
you
were
shown
up
to
my
rooms
be
advised
phinuit
and
forget
your
pistol
even
to
show
it
in
this
city
would
make
matters
infinitely
worse
for
you
than
they
are
he
lying
monk
insisted
putting
a
restraining
hand
on
arm
as
that
one
started
from
his
chair
in
rage
and
panic
he
dare
would
i
not
then
since
you
believe
nothing
till
it
is
proved
to
you
messieurs
permit
me
lanyard
crossed
rapidly
to
the
hall
door
and
flung
it
open
and
fell
back
a
pace
with
a
cry
of
amazement
at
the
threshold
stood
not
the
detective
whom
he
had
expected
to
see
but
a
woman
with
a
cable
message
form
in
one
hand
the
other
lifted
to
knock
madame
lanyard
gasped
madame
de
montalais
the
fluttered
to
the
floor
as
she
entered
with
a
gladness
in
her
face
that
was
carried
out
by
the
impulsive
gesture
with
which
she
gave
him
her
hands
my
dear
friend
she
cried
happily
i
am
so
glad
and
to
think
we
have
been
guests
of
the
same
hotel
for
three
livelong
days
and
never
knew
it
i
arrived
by
la
touraine
saturday
but
your
message
telegraphed
back
from
reached
me
not
five
minutes
ago
i
telephoned
the
desk
they
told
me
the
number
of
your
room
and
here
i
am
but
i
can
not
believe
my
senses
with
unanimous
consent
jules
phinuit
and
monk
uprose
and
made
for
the
door
only
to
find
it
blocked
by
the
substantial
form
of
a
plain
citizen
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
understanding
in
his
eyes
steady
gents
he
counselled
coolly
orders
are
to
let
everybody
in
and
nobody
out
without
lanyard
says
so
for
a
moment
they
hung
in
doubt
and
consternation
consulting
one
another
with
dismayed
stares
then
phinuit
made
as
if
to
shoulder
the
man
aside
but
for
the
sake
of
the
moral
effect
the
latter
casually
exhibited
a
pistol
and
the
moral
effect
of
that
was
stupendous
phinuit
disconsolately
slouched
back
into
the
room
grasping
the
situation
eve
de
montalais
turned
to
the
quartet
eyes
that
glimmered
in
a
face
otherwise
quite
composed
but
how
surprising
she
declared
madame
la
comtesse
de
lorgnes
monsieur
monk
phinuit
how
delightful
to
see
you
all
again
the
civility
met
with
inadequate
appreciation
nothing
could
be
more
opportune
lanyard
declared
for
it
is
to
this
lady
madame
de
montalais
and
to
these
gentlemen
that
you
owe
the
recovery
of
your
jewels
truly
as
i
am
telling
you
but
for
them
their
charming
hospitality
in
inviting
me
to
cruise
aboard
their
yacht
but
for
the
assistance
they
lent
me
though
sometimes
unconsciously
i
admit
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
say
to
you
your
jewels
are
in
a
safe
place
madame
immediately
at
your
disposal
but
how
can
i
thank
them
well
said
lanyard
if
you
ask
me
i
think
we
have
detained
them
long
enough
i
believe
they
would
be
most
grateful
to
be
permitted
to
leave
and
keep
their
numerous
and
pressing
appointments
elsewhere
i
am
entirely
of
your
mind
monsieur
lanyard
nodded
to
the
man
in
the
doorway
all
right
murray
and
he
stood
indifferently
aside
in
silence
the
three
men
moved
to
the
door
and
out
phinuit
with
a
brazen
swagger
jules
without
emotion
visible
monk
with
eyebrows
adroop
and
flapping
but
lanyard
interposed
when
liane
delorme
would
have
followed
a
moment
liane
if
you
will
be
so
good
she
paused
regarding
him
with
a
sombre
and
inscrutable
face
while
he
produced
from
his
a
fat
envelope
without
endorsement
this
is
yours
the
woman
murmured
blankly
mine
he
said
in
a
guarded
voice
papers
i
found
in
the
safe
in
your
library
that
night
i
had
to
take
them
for
use
in
event
of
need
now
they
are
useless
but
you
are
unwise
to
keep
such
papers
liane
the
envelope
was
unsealed
lifting
the
flap
the
woman
half
withdrew
the
enclosure
recognised
it
at
a
glance
and
crushed
it
in
a
convulsive
grasp
while
the
blood
ebbing
swiftly
from
her
face
threw
her
rouge
into
livid
relief
for
an
instant
she
seemed
about
to
speak
then
bowed
her
head
in
dumb
acknowledgment
and
left
the
room
lanyard
nodded
to
murray
who
amiably
closed
the
door
keeping
himself
on
the
outside
of
it
eve
de
montalais
was
eyeing
him
with
an
indulgent
and
amused
glance
as
he
turned
to
her
she
shook
her
head
slowly
in
mockery
of
reproof
that
woman
loves
you
monsieur
she
stated
quietly
he
succeeded
admirably
in
looking
as
if
the
thought
was
strange
to
him
one
is
sure
madame
must
be
mistaken
ah
but
i
am
not
said
eve
de
montalais
who
should
know
better
the
signs
that
tell
of
woman
love
for
you
my
dear
