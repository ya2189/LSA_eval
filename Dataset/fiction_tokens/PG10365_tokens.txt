precaution
a
novel
by
fenimore
cooper
be
wise
it
is
madness
to
defer
caution
may
arrive
too
late
bryant
discourse
on
the
life
genius
and
writings
of
james
fenimore
cooper
delivered
at
metropolitan
hall
february
it
is
now
somewhat
more
than
a
year
since
the
friends
of
james
fenimore
cooper
in
this
city
were
planning
to
give
a
public
dinner
to
his
honor
it
was
intended
as
an
expression
both
of
the
regard
they
bore
him
personally
and
of
the
pride
they
took
in
the
glory
his
writings
had
reflected
on
the
american
name
we
thought
of
what
we
should
say
in
his
hearing
in
what
terms
worthy
of
him
and
of
us
we
should
speak
of
the
esteem
in
which
we
held
him
and
of
the
interest
we
felt
in
a
fame
which
had
already
penetrated
to
the
remotest
nook
of
the
earth
inhabited
by
civilized
man
we
assemble
for
a
sadder
purpose
to
pay
to
the
dead
some
part
of
the
honors
then
intended
for
the
living
we
bring
our
offering
but
he
is
not
here
who
should
receive
it
in
his
stead
are
vacancy
and
silence
there
is
no
eye
to
brighten
at
our
words
and
no
voice
to
answer
it
is
an
empty
office
that
we
perform
said
virgil
in
his
melodious
verses
when
commemorating
the
virtues
of
the
young
marcellus
and
bidding
flowers
be
strewn
with
full
hands
over
his
early
grave
we
might
apply
the
expression
to
the
present
occasion
but
it
would
be
true
in
part
only
we
can
no
longer
do
anything
for
him
who
is
departed
but
we
may
do
what
will
not
be
without
fruit
to
those
who
remain
it
is
good
to
occupy
our
thoughts
with
the
example
of
great
talents
in
conjunction
with
great
virtues
his
genius
has
passed
away
with
him
but
we
may
learn
from
the
history
of
his
life
to
employ
the
faculties
we
possess
with
useful
activity
and
noble
aims
we
may
copy
his
magnanimous
frankness
his
disdain
of
everything
that
wears
the
faintest
semblance
of
deceit
his
refusal
to
comply
with
current
abuses
and
the
courage
with
which
on
all
occasions
he
asserted
what
he
deemed
truth
and
combated
what
he
thought
error
the
circumstances
of
cooper
early
life
were
remarkably
suited
to
confirm
the
natural
hardihood
and
manliness
of
his
character
and
to
call
forth
and
exercise
that
extraordinary
power
of
observation
which
accumulated
the
materials
afterwards
wielded
and
shaped
by
his
genius
his
father
while
an
inhabitant
of
burlington
in
new
jersey
on
the
pleasant
banks
of
the
delaware
was
the
owner
of
large
possessions
on
the
borders
of
the
otsego
lake
in
our
own
state
and
here
in
the
cleared
fields
he
built
in
the
first
house
in
cooperstown
to
this
home
cooper
who
was
born
in
burlington
in
the
year
was
conveyed
in
his
infancy
and
here
as
he
informs
us
in
his
preface
to
the
pioneers
his
first
impressions
of
the
external
world
were
obtained
here
he
passed
his
childhood
with
the
vast
forest
around
him
stretching
up
the
mountains
that
overlook
the
lake
and
far
beyond
in
a
region
where
the
indian
yet
roamed
and
the
white
hunter
half
indian
in
his
dress
and
mode
of
life
sought
his
game
a
region
in
which
the
bear
and
the
wolf
were
yet
hunted
and
the
panther
more
formidable
than
either
lurked
in
the
thickets
and
tales
of
wanderings
in
the
wilderness
and
encounters
with
these
fierce
animals
beguiled
the
length
of
the
winter
nights
of
this
place
cooper
although
early
removed
from
it
to
pursue
his
studies
was
an
occasional
resident
throughout
his
life
and
here
his
last
years
were
wholly
passed
at
the
age
of
thirteen
he
was
sent
to
yale
college
where
notwithstanding
his
extreme
youth
for
with
the
exception
of
the
poet
hillhouse
he
was
the
youngest
of
his
class
and
hillhouse
was
afterwards
withdrawn
his
progress
in
his
studies
is
said
to
have
been
honorable
to
his
talents
he
left
the
college
after
a
residence
of
three
years
and
became
a
midshipman
in
the
united
states
navy
six
years
he
followed
the
sea
and
there
yet
wanders
among
those
who
are
fond
of
literary
anecdote
a
story
of
the
young
sailor
who
in
the
streets
of
one
of
the
english
ports
attracted
the
curiosity
of
the
crowd
by
explaining
to
his
companions
a
latin
motto
in
some
public
place
that
during
this
period
he
made
himself
master
of
the
knowledge
and
the
imagery
which
he
afterwards
employed
to
so
much
advantage
in
his
romances
of
the
sea
the
finest
ever
written
is
a
common
and
obvious
remark
but
it
has
not
been
so
far
as
i
know
observed
that
from
the
discipline
of
a
seaman
life
he
may
have
derived
much
of
his
readiness
and
fertility
of
invention
much
of
his
skill
in
surrounding
the
personages
of
his
novels
with
imaginary
perils
and
rescuing
them
by
probable
expedients
of
all
pursuits
the
life
of
a
sailor
is
that
which
familiarizes
men
to
danger
in
its
most
fearful
shapes
most
cultivates
presence
of
mind
and
most
effectually
calls
forth
the
resources
of
a
prompt
and
fearless
dexterity
by
which
imminent
evil
is
avoided
in
cooper
having
resigned
his
post
as
midshipman
began
the
year
by
marrying
miss
delaney
sister
of
the
present
bishop
of
the
diocese
of
western
new
york
and
entered
upon
a
domestic
life
happily
passed
to
its
close
he
went
to
live
at
mamaroneck
in
the
county
of
westchester
and
while
here
he
wrote
and
published
the
first
of
his
novels
entitled
precaution
concerning
the
occasion
of
writing
this
work
it
is
related
that
once
as
he
was
reading
an
english
novel
to
cooper
who
has
within
a
short
time
past
been
laid
in
the
grave
beside
her
illustrious
husband
and
of
whom
we
may
now
say
that
her
goodness
was
no
less
eminent
than
his
genius
he
suddenly
laid
down
the
book
and
said
i
believe
i
could
write
a
better
myself
almost
immediately
he
composed
a
chapter
of
a
projected
work
of
fiction
and
read
it
to
the
same
friendly
judge
who
encouraged
him
to
finish
it
and
when
it
was
completed
suggested
its
publication
of
this
he
had
at
the
time
no
intention
but
he
was
at
length
induced
to
submit
the
manuscript
to
the
examination
of
the
late
charles
wilkes
of
this
city
in
whose
literary
opinions
he
had
great
confidence
wilkes
advised
that
it
should
be
published
and
to
these
circumstances
we
owe
it
that
cooper
became
an
author
i
confess
i
have
merely
dipped
into
this
work
the
experiment
was
made
with
the
first
edition
deformed
by
a
strange
punctuation
a
profusion
of
commas
and
other
pauses
which
puzzled
and
repelled
me
its
author
many
years
afterwards
revised
and
republished
it
correcting
this
fault
and
some
faults
of
style
also
so
that
to
a
casual
inspection
it
appeared
almost
another
work
it
was
a
professed
delineation
of
english
manners
though
the
author
had
then
seen
nothing
of
english
society
it
had
however
the
honor
of
being
adopted
by
the
country
whose
manners
it
described
and
being
early
republished
in
great
britain
passed
from
the
first
for
an
english
novel
i
am
not
unwilling
to
believe
what
is
said
of
it
that
it
contained
a
promise
of
the
powers
which
its
author
afterwards
put
forth
thirty
years
ago
in
the
year
and
in
the
of
his
life
cooper
published
the
first
of
the
works
by
which
he
will
be
known
to
posterity
the
spy
it
took
the
reading
world
by
a
kind
of
surprise
its
merit
was
acknowledged
by
a
rapid
sale
the
public
read
with
eagerness
and
the
critics
wondered
many
withheld
their
commendations
on
account
of
defects
in
the
plot
or
blemishes
in
the
composition
arising
from
want
of
practice
and
some
waited
till
they
could
hear
the
judgment
of
european
readers
yet
there
were
not
wanting
critics
in
this
country
of
whose
good
opinion
any
author
in
any
part
of
the
world
might
be
proud
who
spoke
of
it
in
terms
it
deserved
are
you
not
delighted
wrote
a
literary
friend
to
me
who
has
since
risen
to
high
distinction
as
a
writer
both
in
verse
and
in
prose
are
you
not
delighted
with
the
spy
as
a
work
of
infinite
spirit
and
genius
in
that
word
genius
lay
the
explanation
of
the
hold
which
the
work
had
taken
on
the
minds
of
men
what
it
had
of
excellence
was
peculiar
and
unborrowed
its
pictures
of
life
whether
in
repose
or
activity
were
drawn
with
broad
lights
and
shadows
immediately
from
living
originals
in
nature
or
in
his
own
imagination
to
him
whatever
he
described
was
true
it
was
made
a
reality
to
him
by
the
strength
with
which
he
conceived
it
his
power
in
the
delineation
of
character
was
shown
in
the
principal
personage
of
his
story
harvey
birch
on
whom
though
he
has
chosen
to
employ
him
in
the
ignoble
office
of
a
spy
and
endowed
him
with
the
qualities
necessary
to
his
profession
extreme
circumspection
fertility
in
stratagem
and
the
art
of
concealing
his
real
character
qualities
which
in
conjunction
with
selfishness
and
greediness
make
the
scoundrel
he
has
bestowed
the
virtues
of
generosity
magnanimity
an
intense
love
of
country
a
fidelity
not
to
be
corrupted
and
a
disinterestedness
beyond
temptation
out
of
this
combination
of
qualities
he
has
wrought
a
character
which
is
a
favorite
in
all
nations
and
with
all
classes
of
mankind
it
is
said
that
if
you
cast
a
pebble
into
the
ocean
at
the
mouth
of
our
harbor
the
vibration
made
in
the
water
passes
gradually
on
till
it
strikes
the
icy
barriers
of
the
deep
at
the
south
pole
the
spread
of
cooper
reputation
is
not
confined
within
narrower
limits
the
spy
is
read
in
all
the
written
dialects
of
europe
and
in
some
of
those
of
asia
the
french
immediately
after
its
first
appearance
gave
it
to
the
multitudes
who
read
their
language
and
placed
it
among
the
first
works
of
its
class
it
was
rendered
into
castilian
and
passed
into
the
hands
of
those
who
dwell
under
the
beams
of
the
southern
cross
at
length
it
passed
the
eastern
frontier
of
europe
and
the
latest
record
i
have
seen
of
its
progress
towards
absolute
universality
is
contained
in
a
statement
of
the
international
magazine
derived
i
presume
from
its
author
that
in
it
was
published
in
a
persian
translation
at
ispahan
before
this
time
i
doubt
not
they
are
reading
it
in
some
of
the
languages
of
hindostan
and
if
the
chinese
ever
translated
anything
it
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
many
millions
who
inhabit
the
far
cathay
i
have
spoken
of
the
hesitation
which
american
critics
felt
in
admitting
the
merits
of
the
spy
on
account
of
crudities
in
the
plot
or
the
composition
some
of
which
no
doubt
really
existed
an
exception
must
be
made
in
favor
of
the
port
folio
which
in
a
notice
written
by
sarah
hall
mother
of
the
editor
of
that
periodical
and
author
of
conversations
on
the
bible
gave
the
work
a
cordial
welcome
and
cooper
as
i
am
informed
never
forgot
this
act
of
timely
and
ready
kindness
it
was
perhaps
favorable
to
the
immediate
success
of
the
spy
that
cooper
had
few
american
authors
to
divide
with
him
the
public
attention
that
crowd
of
clever
men
and
women
who
now
write
for
the
magazines
who
send
out
volumes
of
essays
sketches
and
poems
and
who
supply
the
press
with
novels
biographies
and
historical
works
were
then
for
the
most
part
either
stammering
their
lessons
in
the
schools
or
yet
unborn
yet
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
just
about
the
time
that
the
spy
made
its
appearance
the
dawn
of
what
we
now
call
our
literature
was
just
breaking
the
concluding
number
of
dana
idle
man
a
work
neglected
at
first
but
now
numbered
among
the
best
things
of
the
kind
in
our
language
was
issued
in
the
same
month
the
sketch
book
was
then
just
completed
the
world
was
admiring
it
and
its
author
was
meditating
bracebridge
hall
miss
sedgwick
about
the
same
time
made
her
first
essay
in
that
charming
series
of
novels
of
domestic
life
in
new
england
which
have
gained
her
so
high
a
reputation
percival
now
unhappily
silent
had
just
put
to
press
a
volume
of
poems
i
have
a
copy
of
an
edition
of
hallock
fanny
published
in
the
same
year
the
poem
of
yamoyden
by
eastburn
and

appeared
almost
simultaneously
with
it
livingston
was
putting
the
finishing
hand
to
his
report
on
the
penal
code
of
louisiana
a
work
written
with
such
grave
persuasive
eloquence
that
it
belongs
as
much
to
our
literature
as
to
our
jurisprudence
other
contemporaneous
american
works
there
were
now
less
read
paul
poem
of
noah
was
just
laid
on
the
counters
of
the
booksellers
arden
published
at
the
same
time
in
this
city
a
translation
of
tristia
in
heroic
verse
in
which
the
complaints
of
the
effeminate
roman
poet
were
rendered
with
great
fidelity
to
the
original
and
sometimes
not
without
beauty
if
i
may
speak
of
myself
it
was
in
that
year
that
i
timidly
intrusted
to
the
winds
and
waves
of
public
opinion
a
small
cargo
of
my
own
a
poem
entitled
the
ages
and
half
a
dozen
shorter
ones
in
a
thin
duodecimo
volume
printed
at
cambridge
we
had
at
the
same
time
works
of
elegant
literature
fresh
from
the
press
of
great
britain
which
are
still
read
and
admired
barry
cornwall
then
a
young
suitor
for
fame
published
in
the
same
year
his
marcia
colonna
byron
in
the
full
strength
and
fertility
of
his
genius
gave
the
readers
of
english
his
tragedy
of
marino
faliero
and
was
in
the
midst
of
his
spirited
controversy
with
bowles
concerning
the
poetry
of
pope
the
spy
had
to
sustain
a
comparison
with
scott
antiquary
published
simultaneously
with
it
and
with
lockhart
valerius
which
seems
to
me
one
of
the
most
remarkable
works
of
fiction
ever
composed
in
and
in
his
year
cooper
brought
out
his
novel
of
the
pioneers
the
scene
of
which
was
laid
on
the
borders
of
his
own
beautiful
lake
in
a
recent
survey
of
mr
cooper
works
by
one
of
his
admirers
it
is
intimated
that
the
reputation
of
this
work
may
have
been
in
some
degree
factitious
i
can
not
think
so
i
can
not
see
how
such
a
work
could
fail
of
becoming
sooner
or
later
a
favorite
it
was
several
years
after
its
first
appearance
that
i
read
the
pioneers
and
i
read
it
with
a
delighted
astonishment
here
said
i
to
myself
is
the
poet
of
rural
life
in
this
country
our
hesiod
our
theocritus
except
that
he
writes
without
the
restraint
of
numbers
and
is
a
greater
poet
than
they
in
the
pioneers
as
in
a
moving
picture
are
made
to
pass
before
us
the
hardy
occupations
and
spirited
amusements
of
a
prosperous
settlement
in
a
fertile
region
encompassed
for
leagues
around
with
the
primeval
wilderness
of
woods
the
seasons
in
their
different
aspects
bringing
with
them
their
different
employments

knew
how
to
draw
them

bright
and
healthful
coloring
of
which
he
was
master

interwoven
with
a
regular
narrative
of
human
fortunes
not
unskilfully
constructed
and
how
could
such
a
work
be
otherwise
than
popular
in
the

sky
and
in
companionship
with
a
race
whose
animal
perceptions
are
the
acutest
and
most
cultivated
of
which
there
is
any
example
but
leatherstocking
has
higher
qualities
in
him
there
is
a
genial
blending
of
the
gentlest
virtues
of
the
civilized
man
with
the
better
nature
of
the
aboriginal
tribes
all
that
in
them
is
noble
generous
and
ideal
is
adopted
into
his
own
kindly
character
and
all
that
is
evil
is
rejected
but
why
should
i
attempt
to
analyse
a
character
so
familiar
leatherstocking
is
acknowledged
on
all
hands
to
be
one
of
the
noblest
as
well
as
most
striking
and
original
creations
of
fiction
in
some
of
his
subsequent
novels
cooper
for
he
had
not
yet
attained
to
the
full
maturity
of
his
powers
heightened
and
ennobled
his
first
conception
of
the
character
but
in
the
pioneers
it
dazzled
the
world
with
the
splendor
of
novelty
his
next
work
was
the
pilot
in
which
he
showed
how
from
the
vicissitudes
of
a
life
at
sea
its
perils
and
escapes
from
the
beauty
and
terrors
of
the
great
deep
from
the
working
of
a
vessel
on
a
long
voyage
and
from
the
frank
brave
and
generous
but
peculiar
character
of
the
seaman
may
be
drawn
materials
of
romance
by
which
the
minds
of
men
may
be
as
deeply
moved
as
by
anything
in
the
power
of
romance
to
present
in
this
walk
cooper
has
had
many
disciples
but
no
rival
all
who
have
since
written
romances
of
the
sea
have
been
but
travellers
in
a
country
of
which
he
was
the
great
discoverer
and
none
of
them
all
seemed
to
have
loved
a
ship
as
cooper
loved
it
or
have
been
able
so
strongly
to
interest
all
classes
of
readers
in
its
fortunes
among
other
personages
drawn
with
great
strength
in
the
pilot
is
the
general
favorite
tom
coffin
the
thorough
seaman
with
all
the
virtues
and
one
or
two
of
the
infirmities
of
his
profession
superstitious
as
seamen
are
apt
to
be
yet
whose
superstitions
strike
us
as
but
an
irregular
growth
of
his
devout
recognition
of
the
power
who
holds
the
ocean
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
gentle
full
of
resources
collected
in
danger
and
at
last
calmly
perishing
at
the
post
of
duty
with
the
vessel
he
has
long
guided
by
what
i
may
call
a
great
and
magnanimous
death
his
rougher
and
coarser
companion
boltrope
is
drawn
with
scarcely
less
skill
and
with
a
no
less
vigorous
hand
the
pioneers
is
not
cooper
best
tale
of
the
american
forest
nor
the
pilot
perhaps
in
all
respects
his
best
tale
of
the
sea
yet
if
he
had
ceased
to
write
here
the
measure
of
his
fame
would
possibly
have
been
scarcely
less
ample
than
it
now
is
neither
of
them
is
far
below
the
best
of
his
productions
and
in
them
appear
the
two
most
remarkable
creations
of
his
imagination
two
of
the
most
remarkable
characters
in
all
fiction
it
was
about
this
time
that
my
acquaintance
with
cooper
began
an
acquaintance
of
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
which
his
deportment
towards
me
was
that
of
unvaried
kindness
he
then
resided
a
considerable
part
of
the
year
in
this
city
and
here
he
had
founded
a
weekly
club
to
which
many
of
the
most
distinguished
men
of
the
place
belonged
of
the
members
who
have
since
passed
away
were
chancellor
kent
the
jurist
wiley
the
intelligent
and
liberal
bookseller
henry
sedgwick
always
active
in
schemes
of
benevolence
jarvis
the
painter
a
man
of
infinite
humor
whose
jests
awoke
inextinguishable
laughter
de

the
naturalist

the
poet
jacob
harvey
whose
genial
memory
is
cherished
by
many

was

the
inventor
of
the
electric
telegraph
durand
then
one
of
the
first
of
engravers
and
now
no
less
illustrious
as
a

henry

whose
acquirements
might
awaken
the
envy
of
the
ripest
scholars
of
the
old
world
halleck

verplanck
who
has
given
the
world
the
best
edition
of
shakspeare
for
general
readers
king
now
at
the
head
of
columbia
college
and
his
two
immediate
predecessors
in
that
office
i
might
enlarge
the
list
with
many
other
names
of
no
less
distinction
the
army
and
navy
contributed
their
proportion
of
members
whose
names
are
on
record
in
our
national
history
cooper
when
in
town
was
always
present
and
i
remember
being
struck
with
the
inexhaustible
vivacity
of
his
conversation
and
the
minuteness
of
his
knowledge
in
everything
which
depended
upon
acuteness
of
observation
and
exactness
of
recollection
i
remember
too
being
somewhat
startled
coming
as
i
did
from
the
seclusion
of
a
country
life
with
a
certain
emphatic
frankness
in
his
manner
which
however
i
came
at
last
to
like
and
to
admire
the
club
met
in
the
hotel
called
washington
hall
the
site
of
which
is
now
occupied
by
part
of
the
circuit
of
stewart
marble
building
lionel
lincoln
which
can
not
be
ranked
among
the
successful
productions
of
cooper
was
published
in
and
in
the
year
following
appeared
the
last
of
the
mohicans
which
more
than
recovered
the
ground
lost
by
its
predecessor
in
this
work
the
construction
of
the
narrative
has
signal
defects
but
it
is
one
of
the
triumphs
of
the
author
genius
that
he
makes
us
unconscious
of
them
while
we
read
it
is
only
when
we
have
had
time
to
awake
from
the
intense
interest
in
which
he
has
held
us
by
the
vivid
reality
of
his
narrative
and
have
begun
to
search
for
faults
in
cold
blood
that
we
are
able
to
find
them
in
the
last
of
the
mohicans
we
have
a
bolder
portraiture
of
leatherstocking
than
in
the
pioneers
this
work
was
published
in
and
in
the
same
year
cooper
sailed
with
his
family
for
europe
he
left
new
york
as
one
of
the
vessels
of
war
described
in
his
romances
of
the
sea
goes
out
of
port
amidst
the
thunder
of
a
parting
salute
from
the
big
guns
on
the
batteries
a
dinner
was
given
him
just
before
his
departure
attended
by
most
of
the
distinguished
men
of
the
city
at
which
peter
jay
presided
and
king
addressed
him
in
terms
which
some
then
thought
too
glowing
but
which
would
now
seem
sufficiently
temperate
expressing
the
good
wishes
of
his
friends
and
dwelling
on
the
satisfaction
they
promised
themselves
in
possessing
so
illustrious
a
representative
of
american
literature
in
the
old
world
cooper
was
scarcely
in
france
when
he
remembered
his
friends
of
the
weekly
club
and
sent
frequent
missives
to
be
read
at
its
meetings
but
the
club
missed
its
founder
went
into
a
decline
and
not
long
afterwards
quietly
expired
the
first
of
cooper
novels
published
after
leaving
america
was
the
prairie
which
appeared
early
in
a
work
with
the
admirers
of
which
i
wholly
agree
i
read
it
with
a
certain
awe
an
undefined
sense
of
sublimity
such
as
one
experiences
on
entering
for
the
first
time
upon
those
immense
grassy
deserts
from
which
the
work
takes
its
name
the
squatter
and
his
family
that
brawny
old
man
and
his
sons
living
in
a
sort
of
primitive
and
patriarchal
barbarism
sluggish
on
ordinary
occasions
but
terrible
when
roused
like
the
hurricane
that
sweeps
the
grand
but
monotonous
wilderness
in
which
they
dwell
seem
a
natural
growth
of
ancient
fields
of
the
west
leatherstocking
a
hunter
in
the
pioneers
a
warrior
in
the
last
of
the
mohicans
and
now
in
his
extreme
old
age
a
trapper
on
the
prairie
declined
in
strength
but
undecayed
in
intellect
and
looking
to
the
near
close
of
his
life
and
a
grave
under
the
long
grass
as
calmly
as
the
laborer
at
sunset
looks
to
his
evening
slumber
is
no
less
in
harmony
with
the
silent
desert
in
which
he
wanders
equally
so
are
the
indians
still
his
companions
copies
of
the
american
savage
somewhat
idealized
but
not
the
less
a
part
of
the
wild
nature
in
which
they
have
their
haunts
before
the
year
closed
cooper
had
given
the
world
another
nautical
tale
the
red
rover
which
with
many
is
a
greater
favorite
than
the
pilot
and
with
reason
perhaps
if
we
consider
principally
the
incidents
which
are
conducted
and
described
with
a
greater
mastery
over
the
springs
of
pity
and
terror
it
happened
to
cooper
while
he
was
abroad
as
it
not
unfrequently
happens
to
our
countrymen
to
hear
the
united
states
disadvantageously
compared
with
europe
he
had
himself
been
a
close
observer
of
things
both
here
and
in
the
old
world
and
was
conscious
of
being
able
to
refute
the
detractors
of
his
country
in
regard
to
many
points
he
published
in
after
he
had
been
two
years
in
europe
a
series
of
letters
entitled
notions
of
the
americans
by
a
travelling
bachelor
in
which
he
gave
a
favorable
account
of
the
working
of
our
institutions
and
vindicated
his
country
from
various
flippant
and
misrepresentations
of
foreigners
it
is
rather
too
measured
in
style
but
is
written
from
a
mind
full
of
the
subject
and
from
a
memory
wonderfully
stored
with
particulars
although
years
have
elapsed
since
its
publication
but
little
of
the
vindication
has
become
obsolete
cooper
loved
his
country
and
was
proud
of
her
history
and
her
institutions
but
it
puzzles
many
that
he
should
have
appeared
at
different
times
as
her
eulogist
and
her
censor
my
friends
she
is
worthy
both
of
praise
and
of
blame
and
cooper
was
not
the
man
to
shrink
from
bestowing
either
at
what
seemed
to
him
the
proper
time
he
defended
her
from
detractors
abroad
he
sought
to
save
her
from
flatterers
at
home
i
will
not
say
that
he
was
in
as
good
humor
with
his
country
when
he
wrote
home
at
found
as
when
he
wrote
his
notions
of
the
americans
but
this
i
will
say
that
whether
he
commended
or
censured
he
did
it
in
the
sincerity
of
his
heart
as
a
true
american
and
in
the
belief
that
it
would
do
good
his
notions
of
the
americans
were
more
likely
to
lessen
than
to
increase
his
popularity
in
europe
inasmuch
as
they
were
put
forth
without
the
slightest
regard
to
european
prejudices
in
he
brought
out
the
novel
entitled
the
wept
of
one
of
the
few
of
his
works
which
we
now
rarely
hear
mentioned
he
was
engaged
in
the
composition
of
a
third
nautical
tale
which
he
afterwards
published
under
the
name
of
the
when
the
memorable
revolution
of
the
three
days
of
july
broke
out
he
saw
a
government
ruling
by
fear
and
in
defiance
of
public
opinion
overthrown
in
a
few
hours
with
little
bloodshed
he
saw
the
french
nation
far
from
being
intoxicated
with
their
new
liberty
peacefully
addressing
themselves
to
the
discussion
of
the
institutions
under
which
they
were
to
live
a
work
which
cooper
afterwards
published
his
residence
in
europe
gives
the
outline
of
a
plan
of
government
for
france
furnished
by
him
at
that
time
to
la
fayette
with
whom
he
was
in
habits
of
close
and
daily
intimacy
it
was
his
idea
to
give
permanence
to
the
new
order
of
things
by
associating
two
strong
parties
in
its
support
the
friends
of
legitimacy
and
the
republicans
he
suggested
that
henry
should
be
called
to
the
hereditary
throne
of
france
a
youth
yet
to
be
educated
as
the
head
of
a
free
people
that
the
peerage
should
be
abolished
and
a
legislature
of
two
chambers
established
with
a
constituency
of
at
least
a
million
and
a
half
of
electors
the
senate
to
be
chosen
by
the
general
vote
as
the
representative
of
the
entire
nation
and
the
members
of
the
other
house
to
be
chosen
by
districts
as
the
representatives
of
the
local
interests
to
the
middle
ground
of
politics
so
ostentatiously
occupied
by
louis
philippe
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
he
predicted
a
brief
duration
believing
that
it
would
speedily
be
merged
in
despotism
or
supplanted
by
the
popular
rule
his
prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
more
amply
than
he
could
have
imagined
fulfilled
in
both
its
alternatives
in
one
of
the
controversies
of
that
time
cooper
bore
a
distinguished
part
the
revue
britannique
a
periodical
published
in
paris
boldly
affirmed
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
be
one
of
the
most
expensive
in
the
world
and
its
people
among
the
most
heavily
taxed
of
mankind
this
assertion
was
supported
with
a
certain
show
of
proof
and
the
writer
affected
to
have
established
the
conclusion
that
a
republic
must
necessarily
be
more
expensive
than
a
monarchy
the
partisans
of
the
court
were
delighted
with
the
reasoning
of
the
article
and
claimed
a
triumph
over
our
ancient
friend
la
fayette
who
during
forty
years
had
not
ceased
to
hold
up
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
the
cheapest
in
the
world
at
the
suggestion
of
la
fayette
cooper
replied
to
this
attack
upon
his
country
in
a
letter
which
was
translated
into
french
and
together
with
another
from
general
bertrand
for
many
years
a
resident
in
america
was
laid
before
the
people
of
france
these
two
letters
provoked
a
shower
of
rejoinders
in
which
according
to
cooper
misstatements
were
mingled
with
scurrility
he
commenced
a
series
of
letters
on
the
question
in
dispute
which
were
published
in
the
national
a
daily
sheet
and
gave
the
first
evidence
of
that
extraordinary
acuteness
in
controversy
which
was
no
less
characteristic
of
his
mind
than
the
vigor
of
his
imagination
the
enemies
of
la
fayette
pressed
into
their
service
leavitt
harris
of
new
jersey
afterwards
our
chargé
at
the
court
of
france
but
cooper
replied
to
harris
in
the
national
of
may
closing
a
discussion
in
which
he
had
effectually
silenced
those
who
objected
to
our
institutions
on
the
score
of
economy
of
these
letters
which
would
form
an
important
chapter
in
political
science
no
entire
copy
i
have
been
told
is
to
be
found
in
this
country
one
of
the
consequences
of
earnest
controversy
is
almost
invariably
personal
cooper
was
told
by
one
who
held
an
official
station
under
the
french
government
that
the
part
he
had
taken
in
this
dispute
concerning
taxation
would
neither
be
forgotten
nor
forgiven
the
dislike
he
had
incurred
in
that
quarter
was
strengthened
by
his
novel
of
the
bravo
published
in
the
year
while
he
was
in
the
midst
of
his
quarrel
with
the
aristocratic
party
in
that
work
of
which
he
has
himself
justly
said
that
it
was
thoroughly
american
in
all
that
belonged
to
it
his
object
was
to
show
how
institutions
professedly
created
to
prevent
violence
and
wrong
become
when
perverted
from
their
natural
destination
the
instruments
of
injustice
and
how
in
every
system
which
makes
power
the
exclusive
property
of
the
strong
the
weak
are
sure
to
be
oppressed
the
work
is
written
with
all
the
vigor
and
spirit
of
his
best
novels
the
magnificent
city
of
venice
in
which
the
scene
of
the
story
is
laid
stands
continually
before
the
imagination
and
from
time
to
time
the
gorgeous
ceremonies
of
the
venetian
republic
pass
under
our
eyes
such
as
the
marriage
of
the
doge
with
the
adriatic
and
the
contest
of
the
gondolas
for
the
prize
of
speed
the
bravo
himself
and
several
of
the
other
characters
are
strongly
conceived
and
distinguished
but
the
most
remarkable
of
them
all
is
the
spirited
and
daughter
of
the
jailer
it
has
been
said
by
some
critics
who
judge
of
cooper
by
his
failures
that
he
had
no
skill
in
drawing
female
characters
by
the
same
process
it
might
i
suppose
be
shown
that
raphael
was
but
an
ordinary
painter
it
must
be
admitted
that
when
cooper
drew
a
lady
of
high
breeding
he
was
apt
to
pay
too
much
attention
to
the
formal
part
of
her
character
and
to
make
her
a
mere
bundle
of
cold
proprieties
but
when
he
places
his
heroines
in
some
situation
in
life
which
leaves
him
nothing
to
do
but
to
make
them
natural
and
true
i
know
of
nothing
finer
nothing
more
attractive
or
more
individual
than
the
portraitures
he
has
given
us
figaro
the
wittiest
of
the
french
periodicals
and
at
that
time
on
the
liberal
side
commended
the
bravo
the
journals
on
the
side
of
the
government
censured
it
figaro
afterwards
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
aristocratic
party
and
cooper
became
the
object
of
its
attacks
he
was
not
however
a
man
to
be
driven
from
any
purpose
which
he
had
formed
either
by
flattery
or
abuse
and
both
were
tried
with
equal
ill
success
in
he
published
his
heidenmauer
and
in
his
headsman
of
berne
both
with
a
political
design
similar
to
that
of
the
bravo
though
neither
of
them
takes
the
same
high
rank
among
his
works
in
after
a
residence
of
seven
years
in
different
parts
of
europe
but
mostly
in
france
cooper
returned
to
his
native
country
the
welcome
which
met
him
here
was
somewhat
chilled
by
the
effect
of
the
attacks
made
upon
him
in
france
and
remembering
with
what
zeal
and
at
what
sacrifice
of
the
universal
acceptance
which
his
works
would
otherwise
have
met
he
had
maintained
the
cause
of
his
country
against
the
wits
and
orators
of
the
court
party
in
france
we
can
not
wonder
that
he
should
have
felt
this
coldness
as
undeserved
he
published
shortly
after
his
arrival
in
this
country
a
letter
to
his
countrymen
in
which
he
complained
of
the
censures
cast
upon
him
in
the
american
newspapers
gave
a
history
of
the
part
he
had
taken
in
exposing
the
misstatements
of
the
révue
britannique
and
warned
his
countrymen
against
the
too
common
error
of
resorting
with
a
blind
deference
to
foreign
authorities
often
swayed
by
national
or
political
prejudices
for
our
opinions
of
american
authors
going
beyond
this
topic
he
examined
and
reprehended
the
habit
of
applying
to
the
interpretation
of
our
own
constitution
maxims
derived
from
the
practice
of
other
governments
particularly
that
of
great
britain
the
importance
of
construing
that
instrument
by
its
own
principles
he
illustrated
by
considering
several
points
in
dispute
between
parties
of
the
day
on
which
he
gave
very
decided
opinions
the
principal
effect
of
this
pamphlet
as
it
seemed
to
me
was
to
awaken
in
certain
quarters
a
kind
of
resentment
that
a
successful
writer
of
fiction
should
presume
to
give
lessons
in
politics
i
meddle
not
here
with
the
conclusions
to
which
he
arrived
though
must
be
allowed
to
say
that
they
were
stated
and
argued
with
great
ability
in
cooper
published
the
monnikins
a
satirical
work
partly
with
a
political
aim
and
in
the
same
year
appeared
his
american
democrat
a
view
of
the
civil
and
social
relations
of
the
united
states
discussing
more
gravely
various
topics
touched
upon
in
the
former
work
and
pointing
out
in
what
respects
he
deemed
the
american
people
in
their
practice
to
have
fallen
short
of
the
excellence
of
their
institutions
he
found
time
however
for
a
more
genial
task
that
of
giving
to
the
world
his
observations
on
foreign
countries
in
appeared
his
sketches
of
switzerland
a
series
of
letters
in
four
volumes
the
second
part
published
about
two
months
after
the
first
a
delightful
work
written
in
a
more
fluent
and
flexible
style
than
his
notions
of
the
americans
the
first
part
of
gleanings
in
europe
giving
an
account
of
his
residence
in
france
followed
in
the
same
year
and
the
second
part
of
the
same
work
containing
his
observations
on
england
was
published
in
april
in
these
works
forming
a
series
of
eight
volumes
he
relates
and
describes
with
much
of
the
same
distinctness
as
in
his
novels
and
his
remarks
on
the
manners
and
institutions
of
the
different
countries
often
sagacious
and
always
peculiarly
his
own
derive
from
their
frequent
reference
to
contemporary
events
an
historical
interest
in
appeared
homeward
bound
and
home
as
found
two
satirical
novels
in
which
cooper
held
up
to
ridicule
a
certain
class
of
conductors
of
the
newspaper
press
in
america
these
works
had
not
the
good
fortune
to
become
popular
cooper
did
not
and
because
he
was
too
deeply
in
earnest
perhaps
would
not
infuse
into
his
satirical
works
that
gaiety
without
which
satire
becomes
wearisome
i
believe
however
that
if
they
had
been
written
by
anybody
else
they
would
have
met
with
more
favor
but
the
world
knew
that
cooper
was
able
to
give
them
something
better
and
would
not
be
satisfied
with
anything
short
of
his
best
some
childishly
imagined
that
because
in
the
two
works
i
have
just
mentioned
a
newspaper
editor
is
introduced
in
whose
character
almost
every
possible
vice
of
his
profession
is
made
to
find
a
place
cooper
intended
an
indiscriminate
attack
upon
the
whole
body
of
writers
for
the
newspaper
press
forgetting
that
such
a
portraiture
was
a
satire
only
on
those
to
whom
it
bore
a
likeness
we
have
become
less
sensitive
and
more
reasonable
of
late
and
the
monthly
periodicals
make
sport
for
their
readers
of
the
follies
and
ignorance
of
the
newspaper
editors
without
awakening
the
slightest
resentment
but
cooper
led
the
way
in
this
sort
of
discipline
and
i
remember
some
instances
of
towering
indignation
at
his
audacity
expressed
in
the
journals
of
that
time
the
next
year
cooper
made
his
appearance
before
the
public
in
a
new
department
of
writing
his
naval
history
of
the
united
states
was
brought
out
in
two
octavo
volumes
at
philadelphia
by
carey
and
lea
in
writing
his
stories
of
the
sea
his
attention
had
been
much
turned
to
this
subject
and
his
mind
filled
with
striking
incidents
from
expeditions
and
battles
in
which
our
naval
commanders
had
been
engaged
this
made
his
task
the
lighter
but
he
gathered
his
materials
with
great
industry
and
with
a
conscientious
attention
to
exactness
for
he
was
not
a
man
to
take
a
fact
for
granted
or
allow
imagination
to
usurp
the
place
of
inquiry
he
digested
our
naval
annals
into
a
narrative
written
with
spirit
it
is
true
but
with
that
air
of
sincere
dealing
which
the
reader
willingly
takes
as
a
pledge
of
its
authenticity
an
abridgment
of
the
work
was
afterwards
prepared
and
published
by
the
author
the
edinburgh
review
in
an
article
professing
to
examine
the
statements
both
of
cooper
work
and
of
the
history
of
the
english
navy
written
by
james
a
surgeon
by
profession
made
a
violent
attack
upon
the
american
historian
unfortunately
it
took
james
narrative
as
its
sole
guide
and
followed
it
implicitly
cooper
replied
in
the
democratic
review
for
january
and
by
a
masterly
analysis
of
his
statements
convicting
james
of
in
almost
every
particular
in
which
he
differed
from
himself
refuted
both
james
and
the
reviewer
it
was
a
refutation
which
admitted
of
no
rejoinder
scarce
anything
in
cooper
life
was
so
remarkable
or
so
strikingly
illustrated
his
character
as
his
contest
with
the
newspaper
press
he
engaged
in
it
after
provocations
many
and
long
endured
and
prosecuted
it
through
years
with
great
energy
perseverance
and
practical
dexterity
till
he
was
left
master
of
the
field
in
what
i
am
about
to
say
of
it
i
hope
i
shall
not
give
offence
to
any
one
as
i
shall
speak
without
the
slightest
malevolence
towards
those
with
whom
he
waged
this
controversy
over
some
of
them
as
over
their
renowned
adversary
the
grave
has
now
closed
yet
where
shall
the
truth
be
spoken
if
not
beside
the
grave
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
principal
causes
which
provoked
the
newspaper
attacks
upon
cooper
if
he
had
never
meddled
with
questions
of
government
on
either
side
of
the
atlantic
and
never
satirized
the
newspaper
press
i
have
little
doubt
that
he
would
have
been
spared
these
attacks
i
can
not
however
ascribe
them
all
or
even
the
greater
part
of
them
to
personal
malignity
one
journal
followed
the
example
of
another
with
little
reflection
i
think
in
most
cases
till
it
became
a
sort
of
fashion
not
merely
to
decry
his
works
but
to
arraign
his
motives
it
is
related
that
in
while
he
was
at
paris
an
article
was
shown
him
in
an
american
newspaper
purporting
to
be
a
criticism
on
one
of
his
works
but
reflecting
with
much
asperity
on
his
personal
character
i
care
nothing
he
is
reported
to
have
said
for
the
criticism
but
i
am
not
indifferent
to
the
slander
if
these
attacks
on
my
character
should
be
kept
up
five
years
after
my
return
to
america
i
shall
resort
to
the
new
york
courts
for
protection
he
gave
the
newspaper
press
of
this
state
the
full
period
of
forbearance
on
which
he
had
fixed
but
finding
that
forbearance
seemed
to
encourage
assault
he
sought
redress
in
the
courts
of
law
when
these
litigations
were
first
begun
i
recollect
it
seemed
to
me
that
cooper
had
taken
a
step
which
would
give
him
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
effect
but
little
good
i
said
to
myself
alas
leviathan
is
not
so
tamed
as
he
proceeded
however
i
saw
that
he
had
understood
the
matter
better
than
i
he
put
a
hook
into
the
nose
of
this
huge
monster
wallowing
in
his
inky
pool
and
bespattering
the
he
dragged
him
to
the
land
and
made
him
tractable
one
suit
followed
another
one
editor
was
sued
i
think
times
some
of
them
found
themselves
under
a
second
indictment
before
the
first
was
tried
in
vindicating
himself
to
his
reader
against
the
charge
of
publishing
one
libel
the
angry
journalist
often
floundered
into
another
the
occasions
of
these
prosecutions
seem
to
have
been
always
carefully
considered
for
cooper
was
almost
uniformly
successful
in
obtaining
verdicts
in
a
letter
of
his
written
in
february
about
five
years
i
think
from
the
commencement
of
the
first
prosecutions
he
says
i
have
beaten
every
man
i
have
sued
who
has
not
retracted
his
libels
in
one
of
these
suits
commenced
against
the
late
william
stone
of
the
commercial
advertiser
and
referred
to
the
arbitration
of
three
distinguished
lawyers
he
argued
himself
the
question
of
the
authenticity
of
his
account
of
the
battle
of
lake
erie
which
was
the
matter
in
dispute
i
listened
to
his
opening
it
was
clear
skilful
and
persuasive
but
his
closing
argument
was
said
to
be
splendidly
eloquent
i
have
heard
nothing
like
it
said
a
barrister
to
me
since
the
days
of
emmet
cooper
behaved
liberally
towards
his
antagonists
so
far
as
pecuniary
damages
were
concerned
though
some
of
them
wholly
escaped
their
payment
by
bankruptcy
after
i
believe
about
six
years
of
litigation
the
newspaper
press
gradually
subsided
into
a
pacific
disposition
towards
its
adversary
and
the
contest
closed
with
the
account
of
pecuniary
profit
and
loss
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
nearly
balanced
the
occasion
of
these
suits
was
far
from
honorable
to
those
who
provoked
them
but
the
result
was
i
had
almost
said
creditable
to
all
parties
to
him
as
the
courageous
prosecutor
to
the
administration
of
justice
in
this
country
and
to
the
docility
of
the
newspaper
press
which
he
had
disciplined
into
good
manners
it
was
while
he
was
in
the
midst
of
these
litigations
that
he
published
in
the
pathfinder
people
had
begun
to
think
of
him
as
a
controversialist
acute
keen
and
persevering
occupied
with
his
personal
wrongs
and
schemes
of
attack
and
defence
they
were
startled
from
this
estimate
of
his
character
by
the
moral
duty
of
that
glorious
work
i
must
so
call
it
by
the
vividness
and
force
of
its
delineations
by
the
unspoiled
love
of
nature
apparent
in
every
page
and
by
the
fresh
and
warm
emotions
which
everywhere
gave
life
to
the
narrative
and
the
dialogue
cooper
was
now
in
his
year
but
nothing
which
he
had
produced
in
the
earlier
part
of
his
literary
life
was
written
with
so
much
of
what
might
seem
the
generous
fervor
of
youth
or
showed
the
faculty
of
invention
in
higher
vigor
i
recollect
that
near
the
time
of
its
appearance
i
was
informed
of
an
observation
made
upon
it
by
one
highly
distinguished
in
the
literature
of
our
country
and
of
the
age
between
whom
and
the
author
an
unhappy
coolness
had
for
some
years
existed
as
he
finished
the
reading
of
the
pathfinder
he
exclaimed
they
may
say
what
they
will
of
cooper
the
man
who
wrote
this
book
is
not
only
a
great
man
but
a
good
man
the
readers
of
the
pathfinder
were
quickly
reconciled
to
the
fourth
appearance
of
leatherstocking
when
they
saw
him
made
to
act
a
different
part
from
any
which
the
author
had
hitherto
assigned
him
when
they
saw
him
shown
as
a
lover
and
placed
in
the
midst
of
associations
which
invested
his
character
with
a
higher
and
more
affecting
heroism
in
this
work
are
two
female
characters
portrayed
in
a
masterly
manner
the
corporal
daughter
mabel
dunham
generous
resolute
yet
womanly
and
the
young
indian
woman
called
by
her
tribe
the
dew
of
june
a
personification
of
female
truth
affection
and
sympathy
with
a
strong
aboriginal
cast
yet
a
product
of
nature
as
bright
and
pure
as
that
from
which
she
is
named
mercedes
of
castile
published
near
the
close
of
the
same
year
has
none
of
the
stronger
characteristics
of
cooper
genius
but
in
the
deerslayer
which
appeared
in
another
of
his
leatherstocking
tales
he
gave
us
a
work
rivalling
the
pathfinder
leatherstocking
is
brought
before
us
in
his
early
youth
in
the
first
exercise
of
that
keen
sagacity
which
is
blended
so
harmoniously
with
a
simple
and
ingenuous
goodness
the
two
daughters
of
the
retired
freebooter
dwelling
on
the
otsego
lake
inspire
scarcely
less
interest
than
the
principal
personage
judith
in
the
pride
of
her
beauty
and
intellect
her
good
impulses
contending
with
a
fatal
love
of
admiration
holding
us
fascinated
with
a
constant
interest
in
her
fate
which
with
consummate
skill
we
are
permitted
rather
to
conjecture
than
to
know
and
hetty
scarcely
less
beautiful
in
person
but
wise
in
the
midst
of
that
weakness
beyond
the
wisdom
of
the
loftiest
intellect
through
the
power
of
conscience
and
religion
the
character
of
hetty
would
have
been
a
hazardous
experiment
in
feebler
hands
but
in
his
it
was
admirably
successful
the
two
admirals
and
were
given
to
the
public
in
both
of
them
taking
a
high
rank
among
cooper
the
first
of
these
is
a
sort
of
naval
epic
in
prose
the
flight
and
chase
of
armed
vessels
hold
us
in
breathless
suspense
and
the
are
described
with
a
terrible
power
in
the
later
of
cooper
it
seems
to
me
that
the
mastery
with
which
he
makes
his
grand
processions
of
events
pass
before
the
mind
eye
is
even
greater
than
in
his
earlier
the
next
year
he
published
the
wyandotte
or
hutted
knoll
one
of
his
beautiful
romances
of
the
woods
and
in
two
more
of
his
afloat
and
ashore
and
miles
wallingfordits
sequel
the
long
series
of
his
nautical
tales
was
closed
by
jack
tier
or
the
florida
reef
published
in
when
cooper
was
in
his
sixtieth
year
and
it
is
as
full
of
spirit
energy
invention
presentation
of
objects
and
events
the
vision
and
the
faculty
divine
as
anything
he
has
written
let
me
pause
here
to
say
that
cooper
though
not
a
manufacturer
of
verse
was
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
a
poet
his
imagination
wrought
nobly
and
grandly
and
imposed
its
creations
on
the
mind
of
the
reader
for
realities
with
him
there
was
no
withering
or
decline
or
disuse
of
the
poetic
faculty
as
he
stepped
downwards
from
the
zenith
of
life
no
shadow
or
chill
came
over
it
it
was
like
the
year
of
some
genial
climates
a
perpetual
season
of
verdure
bloom
and
fruitfulness
as
these
works
came
out
i
was
rejoiced
to
see
that
he
was
unspoiled
by
the
controversies
in
which
he
had
allowed
himself
to
become
engaged
that
they
had
not
given
to
these
better
expressions
of
his
genius
any
tinge
of
misanthropy
or
appearance
of
contracting
and
closing
sympathies
any
trace
of
an
interest
in
his
less
large
and
free
than
in
his
earlier
works
before
the
appearance
of
his
jack
tier
cooper
published
in
and
the
following
year
a
series
of
novels
relating
to
the
question
in
which
he
took
great
interest
he
thought
that
the
disposition
manifested
in
certain
quarters
to
make
con
cessions
to
what
he
deemed
a
denial
of
the
rights
of
property
was
a
first
step
in
a
most
dangerous
path
to
discourage
this
disposition
he
wrote
satanstoe
the
chainbearer
and
the
redskins
they
are
didactic
in
their
design
and
want
the
freedom
of
invention
which
belongs
to
cooper
best
novels
but
if
they
had
been
written
by
anybody
but
cooper
by
a
member
of
congress
for
example
or
an
eminent
politician
of
any
class
they
would
have
made
his
reputation
it
was
said
i
am
told
by
a
distinguished
jurist
of
our
state
that
they
entitled
the
author
to
as
high
a
place
in
law
as
his
other
works
had
won
for
him
in
literature
i
had
thought
in
meditating
the
plan
of
this
discourse
to
mention
all
the
works
of
cooper
but
the
length
to
which
i
have
found
it
extending
has
induced
me
to
pass
over
several
written
in
the
last
ten
years
of
his
life
and
to
confine
myself
to
those
which
best
illustrate
his
literary
character
the
last
of
his
novels
was
the
ways
of
the
hour
a
work
in
which
the
objections
he
entertained
to
the
trial
by
jury
in
civil
causes
were
stated
in
the
form
of
a
narrative
it
is
a
voluminous
catalogue
that
of
cooper
published
works
but
it
comprises
not
all
he
wrote
he
committed
to
the
fire
without
remorse
many
of
the
fruits
of
his
literary
industry
it
was
understood
some
years
since
that
he
had
a
work
ready
for
the
press
on
the
middle
states
of
the
union
principally
illustrative
of
their
social
history
but
it
has
not
been
found
among
his
manuscripts
and
the
presumption
is
that
he
must
have
destroyed
it
he
had
planned
a
work
on
the
towns
of
manhattan
for
the
publication
of
which
he
made
arrangements
with
putnam
of
this
city
and
a
part
of
which
already
written
was
in
press
at
the
time
of
his
death
the
printed
part
has
since
been
destroyed
by
fire
but
a
portion
of
the
manuscript
was
recovered
the
work
i
learn
will
be
completed
by
one
of
the
family
who
within
a
few
years
past
has
earned
an
honorable
name
among
the
authors
of
our
country
great
as
was
the
number
of
his
works
and
great
as
was
the
favor
with
which
they
were
received
the
pecuniary
rewards
of
his
success
were
far
less
than
has
been
generally
supposed
scarcely
as
i
am
informed
a
tenth
part
of
what
the
common
rumor
made
them
his
fame
was
infinitely
the
largest
acknowledgment
which
this
most
successful
of
american
authors
received
for
his
labors
the
ways
of
the
hour
appeared
in
at
this
time
his
personal
appearance
was
remarkable
he
seemed
in
perfect
health
and
in
the
highest
energy
and
activity
of
his
faculties
i
have
scarcely
seen
any
man
at
that
period
of
life
on
whom
his
years
sat
more
lightly
his
conversation
had
lost
none
of
its
liveliness
though
it
seemed
somewhat
more
genial
and
forbearing
in
tone
and
his
spirits
none
of
their
elasticity
he
was
contemplating
i
have
since
been
told
another
leatherstocking
tale
deeming
that
he
had
not
yet
exhausted
the
character
and
those
who
consider
what
new
resources
it
yielded
him
in
the
pathfinder
and
the
deerslayer
will
readily
conclude
that
he
was
not
mistaken
the
disease
however
by
which
he
was
removed
was
even
then
impending
over
him
and
not
long
afterwards
his
friends
here
were
grieved
to
learn
that
his
health
was
declining
he
came
to
new
york
so
changed
that
they
looked
at
him
with
sorrow
and
after
a
stay
of
some
weeks
partly
for
the
benefits
of
medical
advice
returned
to
cooperstown
to
leave
it
no
more
his
complaint
gradually
gained
strength
subdued
a
constitution
originally
robust
and
finally
passed
into
a
confirmed
dropsy
in
august
he
was
visited
by
his
excellent
and
learned
friend
francis
a
member
of
the
weekly
club
which
he
had
founded
in
the
early
part
of
his
literary
career
he
found
him
bearing
the
sufferings
of
his
disease
with
manly
firmness
gave
him
such
medical
counsels
as
the
malady
appeared
to
require
prepared
him
delicately
for
its
fatal
termination
and
returned
to
new
york
with
the
most
melancholy
anticipations
in
a
few
days
afterwards
cooper
expired
amid
the
deep
affliction
of
his
family
on
the
of
september
the
day
before
that
on
which
he
should
have
completed
his
year
he
died
apparently
without
pain
in
peace
and
religious
hope
the
relations
of
man
to
his
maker
and
to
that
state
of
being
for
which
the
present
is
but
a
preparation
had
occupied
much
of
his
thoughts
during
his
whole
lifetime
and
he
crossed
with
a
serene
composure
the
mysterious
boundary
which
divides
this
life
from
the
next
the
departure
of
such
a
man
in
the
full
strength
of
his
faculties
on
whom
the
country
had
for
thirty
years
looked
as
one
of
the
permanent
ornaments
of
its
literature
and
whose
name
had
been
so
often
associated
with
praise
with
renown
with
controversy
with
blame
but
never
with
death
diffused
a
universal
awe
it
was
as
if
an
earthquake
had
shaken
the
ground
on
which
we
stood
and
showed
the
grave
opening
by
our
path
in
the
general
grief
for
his
loss
his
virtues
only
were
remembered
and
his
failings
forgotten
of
his
failings
i
have
said
little
such
as
he
had
were
obvious
to
all
the
world
they
lay
on
the
surface
of
his
character
those
who
knew
him
least
made
the
most
account
of
them
with
a
character
so
made
up
of
positive
qualities
a
character
so
independent
and
uncompromising
and
with
a
sensitiveness
far
more
acute
than
he
was
willing
to
acknowledge
it
is
not
surprising
that
occasions
frequently
arose
to
bring
him
sometimes
into
friendly
collision
and
sometimes
in
to
graver
disagreements
and
misunderstandings
with
his
for
his
infirmities
his
friends
found
an
ample
counterpoise
in
the
generous
sincerity
of
his
nature
he
never
thought
of
disguising
his
opinions
and
he
abhorred
all
disguise
in
others
he
did
not
even
deign
to
use
that
show
of
regard
towards
those
of
whom
he
did
not
think
well
which
the
world
tolerates
and
almost
demands
a
manly
expression
of
opinion
however
different
from
his
own
commanded
his
respect
of
his
own
works
he
spoke
with
the
same
freedom
as
of
the
works
of
others
and
never
hesitated
to
express
his
judgment
of
a
book
for
the
reason
that
it
was
written
by
himself
yet
he
could
bear
with
gentleness
any
dissent
from
the
estimate
lie
placed
on
his
own
writings
his
character
was
like
the
bark
of
the
cinnamon
a
rough
and
astringent
rind
without
and
an
intense
sweetness
within
those
who
penetrated
below
the
surface
found
a
genial
temper
warm
affections
and
a
heart
with
ample
place
for
his
friends
their
pursuits
their
good
name
their
welfare
they
found
him
a
philanthropist
though
not
precisely
after
the
fashion
of
the
day
a
religious
man
most
devout
where
devotion
is
most
apt
to
be
a
feeling
rather
than
a
custom
in
the
household
circle
hospitable
and
to
the
extent
of
his
means
in
acts
of
charity
they
found
also
that
though
in
general
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
giving
up
an
old
friend
as
of
giving
up
an
opinion
he
was
not
proof
against
testimony
and
could
part
with
a
mistaken
opinion
as
one
parts
with
an
old
friend
who
has
been
proved
faithless
and
unworthy
in
short
cooper
was
one
of
those
who
to
be
loved
must
be
intimately
known
of
his
literary
character
i
have
spoken
largely
in
the
narrative
of
his
life
but
there
are
yet
one
or
two
remarks
which
must
be
made
to
do
it
justice
in
that
way
of
writing
in
which
he
excelled
it
seems
to
me
that
he
united
in
a
degree
those
qualities
which
enabled
him
to
interest
the
largest
number
of
readers
he
wrote
not
for
the
fastidious
the
the
morbidly
delicate
for
these
find
in
his
genius
something
too
robust
for
their
liking
something
by
which
their
sensibilities
are
too
rudely
shaken
but
he
wrote
for
mankind
at
large
for
men
and
women
in
the
ordinary
healthful
state
of
feeling
and
in
their
admiration
he
found
his
reward
it
is
for
this
class
that
public
libraries
are
obliged
to
provide
themselves
with
an
extraordinary
number
of
copies
of
his
works
the
number
in
the
mercantile
library
in
this
city
i
am
told
is
forty
hence
it
is
that
he
has
earned
a
fame
wider
i
think
than
any
author
of
modern
times
wider
certainly
than
any
author
of
any
age
ever
enjoyed
in
his
lifetime
all
his
excellences
are
translatable
they
pass
readily
into
languages
the
least
allied
in
their
genius
to
that
in
which
he
wrote
and
in
them
he
touches
the
heart
and
kindles
the
imagination
with
the
same
power
as
in
the
original
english
cooper
was
not
wholly
without
humor
it
is
sometimes
found
lurking
in
the
dialogue
of
harvey
birch
and
of
leatherstocking
but
it
forms
no
considerable
element
in
his
works
and
if
it
did
it
would
have
stood
in
the
way
of
his
universal
popularity
since
of
all
qualities
it
is
the
most
difficult
to
transfuse
into
a
foreign
language
nor
did
the
effect
he
produced
upon
the
reader
depend
on
any
grace
of
style
which
would
escape
a
translator
of
ordinary
skill
with
his
style
it
is
true
he
took
great
pains
and
in
his
earlier
works
i
am
told
sometimes
altered
the
proofs
sent
from
the
printer
so
largely
that
they
might
be
said
to
be
written
over
yet
he
attained
no
special
felicity
variety
or
compass
of
expression
his
style
however
answered
his
purpose
it
has
defects
but
it
is
manly
and
clear
and
stamps
on
the
mind
of
the
reader
the
impression
he
desired
to
convey
i
am
not
sure
that
some
of
the
very
defects
of
cooper
novels
do
not
add
by
a
certain
force
of
contrast
to
their
power
over
the
mind
he
is
long
in
getting
at
the
interest
of
his
narrative
the
progress
of
the
plot
at
first
is
like
that
of
one
of
his
own
vessels
of
war
slowly
heavily
and
even
awkwardly
working
out
of
a
harbor
we
are
impatient
and
weary
but
when
the
vessel
is
once
in
the
open
sea
and
feels
the
free
breath
of
heaven
in
her
full
sheets
our
delight
and
admiration
is
all
the
greater
at
the
grace
the
majesty
and
power
with
which
she
divides
and
bears
down
the
waves
and
pursues
her
course
at
will
over
the
great
waste
of
waters
such
are
the
works
so
widely
read
and
so
universally
admired
in
all
the
zones
of
the
globe
and
by
men
of
every
kindred
and
every
tongue
works
which
have
made
of
those
who
dwell
in
remote
latitudes
wanderers
in
our
forests
and
observers
of
our
manners
and
have
inspired
them
with
an
interest
in
our
history
a
gentleman
who
had
returned
from
europe
just
before
the
death
of
cooper
was
asked
what
he
found
the
people
of
the
continent
doing
they
all
are
reading
cooper
he
answered
in
the
little
kingdom
of
holland
with
its
three
millions
of
inhabitants
i
looked
into
four
different
translations
of
cooper
in
the
language
of
the
country
a
traveller
who
has
seen
much
of
the
middle
classes
of
italy
lately
said
to
me
i
found
that
all
they
knew
of
america
and
that
was
not
little
they
had
learned
from
cooper
novels
from
him
they
had
learned
the
story
of
american
liberty
and
through
him
they
had
been
introduced
to
our
washington
they
had
read
his
works
till
the
shores
of
the
hudson
and
the
valleys
of
westchester
and
the
banks
of
otsego
lake
had
become
to
them
familiar
ground
over
all
the
countries
into
whose
speech
this
great
man
works
have
been
rendered
by
the
labors
of
their
scholars
the
sorrow
of
that
loss
which
we
deplore
is
now
diffusing
itself
here
we
lament
the
ornament
of
our
country
there
they
mourn
the
death
of
him
who
delighted
the
human
race
even
now
while
i
speak
the
pulse
of
grief
which
is
passing
through
the
nations
has
haply
just
reached
some
remote
neighborhood
the
news
of
his
death
has
been
brought
to
some
dwelling
on
the
slopes
of
the
andes
or
amidst
the
snowy
wastes
of
the
north
and
the
damsel
of
chile
or
the
maid
of
norway
is
sad
to
think
that
he
whose
stories
of
heroism
and
true
love
have
so
often
kept
her
for
hours
from
her
pillow
lives
no
more
he
is
gone
but
the
creations
of
his
genius
fixed
in
living
words
survive
the
frail
material
organs
by
which
the
words
were
first
traced
they
partake
of
a
middle
nature
between
the
deathless
mind
and
the
decaying
body
of
which
they
are
the
common
offspring
and
are
therefore
destined
to
a
duration
if
not
eternal
yet
indefinite
the
examples
he
has
given
in
his
glorious
fictions
of
heroism
honor
and
truth
of
large
sympathies
between
man
and
man
of
all
that
is
good
great
and
excellent
embodied
in
personages
marked
with
so
strong
an
individuality
that
we
place
them
among
our
friends
and
favorites
his
frank
and
generous
men
his
gentle
and
noble
women
shall
live
through
centuries
to
come
and
only
perish
with
our
language
i
have
said
with
our
language
but
who
shall
say
when
it
may
be
the
fate
of
the
english
language
to
be
numbered
with
the
extinct
forms
of
human
speech
who
shall
declare
which
of
the
present
tongues
of
the
civilized
world
will
survive
its
fellows
it
may
be
that
some
one
of
them
more
fortunate
than
the
rest
will
long
outlast
them
in
some
undisturbed
quarter
of
the
globe
and
in
the
midst
of
a
new
civilization
the
creations
of
cooper
genius
even
now
transferred
to
that
language
may
remain
to
be
the
delight
of
the
nations
through
another
great
cycle
of
centuries
beginning
after
the
english
language
and
its
contemporaneous
form
of
civilization
shall
have
passed
away
preface
to
the
new
edition
this
book
originally
owed
its
existence
to
an
accident
and
it
was
printed
under
circumstances
that
prevented
the
usual
supervision
of
the
press
by
the
author
the
consequences
were
many
defects
in
plot
style
and
arrangement
that
were
entirely
owing
to
precipitation
and
inexperience
and
quite
as
many
faults
of
another
nature
that
are
to
be
traced
solely
to
a
bad
manuscript
and
worse
proof
reading
perhaps
no
novel
of
our
times
was
worst
printed
than
the
first
edition
of
this
work
more
than
a
hundred
periods
were
placed
in
the
middle
of
sentences
and
perhaps
five
times
that
number
were
omitted
in
places
where
they
ought
to
have
been
inserted
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
that
passages
were
rendered
obscure
and
that
entire
paragraphs
were
unintelligible
most
of
the
faults
just
mentioned
have
now
been
corrected
though
it
would
require
more
labor
than
would
produce
an
entirely
new
work
to
repair
all
the
inherent
defects
that
are
attributable
to
haste
and
to
the
awkwardness
of
a
novice
in
the
art
of
composing
in
this
respect
the
work
and
its
blemishes
are
probably
inseparable
still
the
reader
will
now
be
better
rewarded
for
his
time
and
on
the
whole
the
book
is
much
more
worthy
of
his
attention
it
has
been
said
that
precaution
owes
its
existence
to
fortuitous
circumstances
the
same
causes
induced
its
english
plot
and
in
a
measure
the
medley
of
characters
that
no
doubt
will
appear
a
mistake
in
the
conception
it
can
scarcely
be
said
that
the
work
was
commenced
with
any
view
to
publication
and
when
it
was
finally
put
into
a
hands
with
all
its
imperfections
on
its
head
the
last
thought
of
the
writer
was
any
expectation
that
it
would
be
followed
by
a
series
of
similar
tales
from
the
same
pen
more
than
this
the
public
will
feel
no
interest
in
knowing
and
less
than
this
the
author
could
not
consent
to
say
on
presenting
to
the
world
a
reprint
of
a
book
with
so
few
claims
to
notice
precaution
chapter
i
i
wonder
if
we
are
to
have
a
neighbor
in
the
deanery
soon
inquired
clara
moseley
addressing
herself
to
a
small
party
assembled
in
her
father
while
standing
at
a
window
which
commanded
a
distant
view
of
the
house
in
question
oh
yes
replied
her
brother
the
agent
has
let
it
to
a
jarvis
for
a
couple
of
years
and
he
is
to
take
possession
this
week
and
who
is
the
jarvis
that
is
about
to
become
so
near
a
neighbor
asked
sir
edward
moseley
why
sir
i
learn
he
has
been
a
capital
merchant
that
he
has
retired
from
business
with
a
large
fortune
that
he
has
like
yourself
sir
an
only
hope
for
his
declining
years
in
son
an
officer
in
the
army
and
moreover
that
he
has
couple
of
fine
daughters
so
sir
he
is
a
man
of
family
in
one
sense
at
least
you
see
but
dropping
his
voice
whether
he
is
a
man
of
family
in
your
sense
jane
looking
at
his
second
sister
is
more
than
i
could
discover
i
hope
you
did
not
take
the
trouble
sir
to
inquire
on
my
account
retorted
jane
coloring
slightly
with
vexation
at
his
speech
indeed
i
did
my
dear
sis
and
solely
on
your
account
replied
the
laughing
brother
for
you
well
know
that
no
gentility
no
husband
and
it
dull
work
to
you
young
ladies
without
at
least
a
possibility
of
matrimony
as
for
clara
she
is
here
he
was
stopped
by
his
youngest
sister
emily
placing
her
hand
on
his
mouth
as
she
whispered
in
his
ear
john
you
forget
the
anxiety
of
a
certain
gentleman
about
a
fair
incognita
at
bath
and
a
list
of
inquiries
concerning
her
lineage
and
a
few
other
indispensables
john
in
his
turn
colored
and
affectionately
kissing
the
hand
which
kept
him
silent
addressed
himself
to
jane
and
by
his
vivacity
and
good
humor
soon
restored
her
to
complacency
i
rejoice
said
lady
moseley
that
sir
william
has
found
a
tenant
however
for
next
to
occupying
it
himself
it
is
a
most
desirable
thing
to
have
a
good
tenant
in
it
on
account
of
the
circle
in
which
we
live
and
jarvis
has
the
great
goodness
of
money
by
john
account
caustically
observed
wilson
who
was
a
sister
of
sir
edward
let
me
tell
you
madam
cried
the
rector
of
the
parish
looking
around
him
pleasantly
and
who
was
pretty
constant
and
always
a
welcome
visitor
in
the
family
that
a
great
deal
of
money
is
a
very
good
thing
in
itself
and
that
a
great
many
very
good
things
may
be
done
with
it
such
as
paying
tythes
ha
doctor
cried
haughton
a
gentleman
of
landed
property
in
the
neighborhood
of
plain
exterior
but
great
goodness
of
heart
and
between
whom
and
the
rector
subsisted
the
most
cordial
good
will
aye
tythes
or
halves
as
the
baronet
did
here
when
he
forgave
old
gregson
one
half
his
rent
and
his
children
the
other
well
but
my
dear
said
sir
edward
to
his
wife
you
must
not
starve
our
friends
because
we
are
to
have
a
neighbor
william
has
stood
with
the
door
open
these
five
minutes
lady
moseley
gave
her
hand
to
the
rector
and
the
company
followed
them
without
any
order
to
the
dinner
table
the
party
assembled
around
the
hospitable
board
of
the
baronet
was
composed
besides
the
persons
of
the
wife
of
haughton
a
woman
of
much
good
sense
and
modesty
of
deportment
their
daughter
a
young
lady
conspicuous
for
nothing
but
good
nature
and
the
wife
and
son
of
the
rector
the
latter
but
lately
admitted
to
holy
orders
himself
the
remainder
of
the
day
passed
in
an
uninterrupted
flow
of
pleasant
conversation
the
natural
consequence
of
a
unison
of
opinions
on
all
leading
questions
the
parties
having
long
known
and
esteemed
each
other
for
those
qualities
which
soonest
reconcile
us
to
the
common
frailties
of
our
nature
on
parting
at
the
usual
hour
it
was
agreed
to
meet
that
day
week
at
the
rectory
and
the
doctor
on
making
his
bow
to
lady
moseley
observed
that
he
intended
in
virtue
of
his
office
to
make
an
early
call
on
the
jarvis
family
and
that
if
possible
he
would
persuade
them
to
be
of
the
party
sir
edward
moseley
was
descended
from
one
of
the
most
respectable
of
the
creations
of
his
order
by
james
and
had
inherited
with
many
of
the
virtues
of
his
ancestor
an
estate
which
placed
him
amongst
the
greatest
landed
proprietors
of
the
county
but
as
it
had
been
an
invariable
rule
never
to
deduct
a
single
acre
from
the
inheritance
of
the
eldest
son
and
the
extravagance
of
his
mother
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
nobleman
had
much
embarrassed
the
affairs
of
his
father
sir
edward
on
coming
into
possession
of
his
estate
had
wisely
determined
to
withdraw
from
the
gay
world
by
renting
his
house
in
town
and
retiring
altogether
to
his
respectable
mansion
about
a
hundred
miles
from
the
metropolis
here
he
hoped
by
a
course
of
systematic
but
liberal
economy
to
release
himself
from
all
embarrassments
and
to
make
such
a
provision
for
his
younger
children
the
three
daughters
already
mentioned
as
he
conceived
their
birth
entitled
them
to
expect
seventeen
years
enabled
him
to
accomplish
this
plan
and
for
more
than
eighteen
months
sir
edward
had
resumed
the
hospitality
and
appearance
usual
in
his
family
and
had
even
promised
his
delighted
girls
to
take
possession
the
ensuing
winter
of
the
house
in
james
square
nature
had
not
qualified
sir
edward
for
great
or
continued
exertions
and
the
prudent
decision
he
had
taken
to
retrieve
his
fortunes
was
perhaps
an
act
of
as
much
forecast
and
vigor
as
his
talents
or
energy
would
afford
it
was
the
step
most
obviously
for
his
interests
and
the
one
that
was
safest
both
in
its
execution
and
consequences
and
as
such
it
had
been
adopted
but
had
it
required
a
single
particle
more
of
enterprise
or
calculation
it
would
have
been
beyond
his
powers
and
the
heir
might
have
yet
labored
under
the
difficulties
which
distressed
his
more
brilliant
but
less
prudent
parent
the
baronet
was
warmly
attached
to
his
wife
and
as
she
was
a
woman
of
many
valuable
and
no
obnoxious
qualities
civil
and
attentive
by
habit
to
all
around
her
and
perfectly
disinterested
in
her
attachments
to
her
own
family
nothing
in
nature
could
partake
more
of
perfection
in
the
eyes
of
her
husband
and
children
than
the
conduct
of
this
beloved
relative
yet
lady
moseley
had
her
failings
however
although
few
were
disposed
to
view
her
errors
with
that
severity
which
truth
and
a
just
discrimination
of
character
render
necessary
her
union
had
been
one
of
love
and
for
a
time
it
had
been
objected
to
by
the
friends
of
her
husband
on
the
score
of
fortune
but
constancy
and
perseverance
prevailed
and
the
protracted
and
inconsequent
opposition
of
his
parents
had
left
no
other
effects
than
an
aversion
in
the
children
to
the
exercise
of
parental
authority
in
marrying
their
own
descendents
an
aversion
which
though
common
to
both
the
worthy
baronet
and
his
wife
was
somewhat
different
in
its
two
subjects
in
the
husband
it
was
quiescent
but
in
the
wife
it
was
slightly
shaded
with
the
female
esprit
de
corps
of
having
her
daughters
comfortably
established
and
that
in
due
season
lady
moseley
was
religious
but
hardly
pious
she
was
charitable
in
deeds
but
not
always
in
opinions
her
intentions
were
pure
but
neither
her
prejudices
nor
her
reasoning
powers
suffered
her
to
be
at
all
times
consistent
still
few
knew
her
that
did
not
love
her
and
none
were
ever
heard
to
say
aught
against
her
breeding
her
morals
or
her
disposition
the
sister
of
sir
edward
had
been
married
early
in
life
to
an
officer
in
the
army
who
spending
much
of
his
time
abroad
on
service
had
left
her
a
prey
to
that
solicitude
to
which
she
was
necessarily
a
prey
by
her
attachment
to
her
husband
to
find
relief
from
this
perpetual
and
wearing
anxiety
an
invaluable
friend
had
pointed
out
the
only
true
remedy
of
which
her
case
admitted
a
research
into
her
own
heart
and
the
employments
of
active
benevolence
the
death
of
her
husband
who
lost
his
life
in
battle
caused
her
to
withdraw
in
a
great
measure
from
the
world
and
gave
time
and
inducement
for
reflections
which
led
to
impressions
on
religion
that
were
sufficiently
correct
in
themselves
and
indispensable
as
the
basis
of
future
happiness
but
which
became
slightly
tinctured
with
the
sternness
of
her
vigorous
mind
and
possibly
at
times
were
more
unbending
than
was
compatible
with
the
comforts
of
this
world
a
fault
however
of
manner
more
than
of
matter
warmly
attached
to
her
brother
and
his
children
wilson
who
had
never
been
a
mother
herself
yielded
to
their
earnest
entreaties
to
become
one
of
the
family
and
although
left
by
the
late
general
wilson
with
a
large
income
ever
since
his
death
she
had
given
up
her
own
establishment
and
devoted
most
of
her
time
to
the
formation
of
the
character
of
her
youngest
niece
lady
moseley
had
submitted
this
child
entirely
to
the
control
of
the
aunt
and
it
was
commonly
thought
emily
would
inherit
the
very
handsome
sum
left
at
the
disposal
of
the
general
widow
both
sir
edward
and
lady
moseley
possessed
a
large
share
of
personal
beauty
when
young
and
it
had
descended
in
common
to
all
their
children
but
more
particularly
to
the
two
youngest
daughters
although
a
strong
family
resemblance
both
in
person
and
character
existed
between
these
closely
connected
relatives
yet
it
existed
with
shades
of
distinction
that
had
very
different
effects
on
their
conduct
and
led
to
results
which
stamped
their
lives
with
widely
differing
degrees
of
happiness
between
the
families
at
moseley
hall
and
the
rectory
there
had
existed
for
many
years
an
intimacy
founded
on
esteem
and
on
long
intercourse
doctor
ives
was
a
clergyman
of
deep
piety
and
of
very
considerable
talents
he
possessed
in
addition
to
a
moderate
benefice
an
independent
fortune
in
right
of
his
wife
who
was
the
only
child
of
a
distinguished
naval
officer
both
were
well
connected
well
bred
and
well
disposed
to
their
fellow
creatures
they
were
blessed
with
but
one
child
the
young
divine
we
have
mentioned
who
promised
to
equal
his
father
in
all
those
qualities
which
had
made
the
doctor
the
delight
of
his
friends
and
almost
the
idol
of
his
parishioners
between
francis
ives
and
clara
moseley
there
had
been
an
attachment
which
had
grown
with
their
years
from
childhood
he
had
been
her
companion
in
their
youthful
recreations
had
espoused
her
little
quarrels
and
participated
in
her
innocent
pleasures
for
so
many
years
and
with
such
an
evident
preference
for
each
other
in
the
youthful
pair
that
on
leaving
college
to
enter
on
the
studies
of
his
sacred
calling
with
his
father
francis
rightly
judged
that
none
other
would
make
his
future
life
as
happy
as
the
mild
the
tender
the
unassuming
clara
their
passion
if
so
gentle
a
feeling
deserve
the
term
received
the
sanction
of
their
parents
and
the
two
families
waited
only
for
the
establishment
of
the
young
divine
to
perfect
the
union
the
retirement
of
sir
edward
family
had
been
uniform
with
the
exception
of
an
occasional
visit
to
an
aged
uncle
of
his
wife
and
who
in
return
spent
much
of
his
time
with
them
at
the
hall
and
who
had
openly
declared
his
intention
of
making
the
children
of
lady
moseley
his
heirs
the
visits
of
benfield
were
always
hailed
with
joy
and
as
an
event
that
called
for
more
than
ordinary
gaiety
for
although
rough
in
manner
and
somewhat
infirm
from
years
the
old
bachelor
who
was
rather
addicted
to
the
customs
in
which
he
had
indulged
in
his
youth
and
was
fond
of
dwelling
on
the
scenes
of
former
days
was
universally
beloved
where
he
was
intimately
known
for
an
unbounded
though
eccentric
philanthropy
the
illness
of
the
of
wilson
had
called
her
to
bath
the
winter
preceding
the
spring
when
our
history
commences
and
she
had
been
accompanied
thither
by
her
nephew
and
favorite
niece
john
and
emily
during
the
month
of
their
residence
in
that
city
were
in
the
practice
of
making
daily
excursions
in
its
environs
it
was
in
one
of
these
little
drives
that
they
were
of
accidental
service
to
a
very
young
and
very
beautiful
woman
apparently
in
low
health
they
had
taken
her
up
in
their
carriage
and
conveyed
her
to
a
where
she
resided
during
a
faintness
which
had
come
over
her
in
a
walk
and
her
beauty
air
and
manner
altogether
so
different
from
those
around
her
had
interested
them
both
to
a
painful
degree
they
had
ventured
to
call
the
following
day
to
inquire
after
her
welfare
and
this
visit
led
to
a
slight
intercourse
which
continued
for
the
fortnight
they
remained
there
john
had
given
himself
some
trouble
to
ascertain
who
she
was
but
in
vain
they
could
merely
learn
that
her
life
was
blameless
that
she
saw
no
one
but
themselves
and
her
dialect
raised
a
suspicion
that
she
was
not
english
it
was
to
this
unknown
fair
emily
alluded
in
her
playful
attempt
to
stop
the
heedless
rattle
of
her
brother
who
was
not
always
restrained
from
uttering
what
he
thought
by
a
proper
regard
for
the
feelings
of
others
chapter
ii
the
morning
succeeding
the
day
of
the
dinner
at
the
hall
wilson
with
all
her
nieces
and
her
nephew
availed
herself
of
the
fineness
of
the
weather
to
walk
to
the
rectory
where
they
were
all
in
the
habit
of
making
informal
and
friendly
visits
they
had
just
got
out
of
the
little
village
of
b
which
lay
in
their
route
when
a
rather
handsome
travelling
carriage
and
four
passed
them
and
took
the
road
which
led
to
the
deanery
as
i
live
cried
john
there
go
our
new
neighbors
the
jarvis
yes
yes
that
must
be
the
old
merchant
muffled
up
in
the
corner
i
mistook
him
at
first
for
a
pile
of
bandboxes
then
the
lady
with
so
many
feathers
must
be
the
old
lady
heaven
forgive
me
jarvis
i
mean
aye
and
the
two
others
the
belles
you
are
in
a
hurry
to
pronounce
them
belles
john
said
jane
pettishly
it
would
be
well
to
see
more
of
them
before
you
speak
so
decidedly
oh
replied
john
i
have
seen
enough
of
them
and
he
was
interrupted
by
the
whirling
of
a
tilbury
and
tandem
followed
by
a
couple
of
servants
on
horseback
all
about
this
vehicle
and
its
masters
bore
the
stamp
of
decided
fashion
and
our
party
had
followed
it
with
their
eyes
for
a
short
distance
when
having
reached
a
fork
in
the
roads
it
stopped
and
evidently
waited
the
coming
up
of
the
pedestrians
as
if
to
make
an
inquiry
a
single
glance
of
the
eye
was
sufficient
to
apprise
the
gentleman
on
the
cushion
who
held
the
reins
of
the
kind
of
people
he
had
to
deal
with
and
stepping
from
his
carriage
he
met
them
with
a
graceful
bow
and
after
handsomely
apologizing
for
the
trouble
he
was
giving
he
desired
to
know
which
road
led
to
the
deanery
the
right
replied
john
returning
his
salutation
ask
them
colonel
cried
the
charioteer
whether
the
old
gentleman
went
right
or
not
the
colonel
in
the
manner
of
a
perfect
gentleman
but
with
a
look
of
compassion
for
his
companion
want
of
tact
made
the
desired
inquiry
which
being
satisfactorily
answered
he
again
bowed
and
was
retiring
as
one
of
several
pointers
who
followed
the
cavalcade
sprang
upon
jane
and
soiled
her
walking
dress
with
his
dirty
feet
come
hither
dido
cried
the
colonel
hastening
to
beat
the
dog
back
from
the
young
lady
and
again
he
apologized
in
the
same
collected
and
handsome
manner
then
turning
to
one
of
the
servants
he
said
call
in
the
dog
sir
and
rejoined
his
companion
the
air
of
this
gentleman
was
peculiarly
pleasant
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
pronounce
him
a
soldier
had
he
not
been
addressed
as
such
by
his
younger
and
certainly
less
polished
companion
the
colonel
was
apparently
about
thirty
and
of
extremely
handsome
face
and
figure
while
his
driving
friend
appeared
several
years
younger
and
of
altogether
different
materials
i
wonder
said
jane
as
they
turned
a
corner
which
hid
them
from
view
who
they
are
who
they
are
cried
the
brother
why
the
jarvis
to
be
sure
you
hear
them
ask
the
road
to
the
deanery
oh
the
one
that
drove
he
may
be
a
jarvis
but
not
the
gentleman
who
spoke
to
us
surely
not
john
besides
he
was
called
colonel
you
know
yes
yes
said
john
with
one
of
his
quizzing
expressions
colonel
jarvis
that
must
be
the
alderman
they
are
commonly
colonels
of
city
volunteers
yes
that
must
have
been
the
old
who
spoke
to
us
and
i
was
right
after
all
about
the
bandboxes
you
forget
said
clara
smiling
the
polite
inquiry
concerning
the
old
ah
true
who
the
deuce
can
this
colonel
be
then
for
young
jarvis
is
only
a
captain
i
know
who
do
you
think
he
is
jane
how
do
you
think
i
can
tell
you
john
but
whoever
he
is
he
owns
the
tilbury
although
he
did
not
drive
it
and
he
is
a
gentleman
both
by
birth
and
manners
why
jane
if
you
know
so
much
of
him
you
should
know
more
but
it
is
all
guess
with
you
no
it
is
not
guess
i
am
certain
of
what
i
say
the
aunt
and
sisters
who
had
taken
little
interest
in
the
dialogue
looked
at
her
with
some
surprise
which
john
observing
he
exclaimed
poh
she
knows
no
more
than
we
all
know
indeed
i
do
poh
poh
if
you
know
tell
why
the
arms
were
different
john
laughed
as
he
said
that
is
a
good
reason
sure
enough
for
the
tilbury
being
the
colonel
property
but
now
for
his
blood
how
did
you
discover
that
sis
by
his
gait
and
actions
as
we
say
of
horses
jane
colored
a
little
and
laughed
faintly
the
arms
on
the
tilbury
had
six
quarterings
emily
now
laughed
and
wilson
and
clara
smiled
while
john
continued
his
teazing
until
they
reached
the
rectory
while
chatting
with
the
doctor
and
his
wife
francis
returned
from
his
morning
ride
and
told
them
the
jarvis
family
had
arrived
he
had
witnessed
an
unpleasant
accident
to
a
gig
in
which
were
captain
jarvis
and
a
friend
a
colonel
egerton
it
had
been
awkwardly
driven
in
turning
into
the
deanery
gate
and
upset
the
colonel
received
some
injury
to
his
ankle
nothing
however
serious
he
hoped
but
such
as
to
put
him
under
the
care
of
the
young
ladies
probably
for
a
few
days
after
the
exclamations
which
usually
follow
such
details
jane
ventured
to
inquire
who
colonel
egerton
was
i
understood
at
the
time
from
one
of
the
servants
that
he
is
a
nephew
of
sir
edgar
egerton
and
a
on
or
furlough
or
some
such
thing
how
did
he
bear
his
misfortune
mr
francis
inquired
wilson
certainly
as
a
gentleman
madam
if
not
as
a
christian
replied
the
young
clergyman
slily
smiling
indeed
most
men
of
gallantry
would
i
believe
rejoice
in
an
accident
which
drew
forth
so
much
sympathy
as
both
the
miss
jarvis
manifested
how
fortunate
you
should
all
happen
to
be
near
said
the
hearted
clara
are
the
young
ladies
pretty
asked
jane
with
something
of
hesitation
in
her
manner
why
i
rather
think
they
are
but
i
took
very
little
notice
of
their
appearance
as
the
colonel
was
really
in
evident
pain
this
then
cried
the
doctor
affords
me
an
additional
excuse
for
calling
on
them
at
an
early
day
so
i
go
i
trust
doctor
ives
wants
no
apologies
for
performing
his
duty
said
wilson
he
is
fond
of
making
them
though
said
ives
speaking
with
a
benevolent
smile
and
for
the
first
time
in
the
little
conversation
it
was
then
arranged
that
the
rector
should
make
his
official
visit
as
intended
by
himself
and
on
his
report
the
ladies
would
act
after
remaining
at
the
rectory
an
hour
they
returned
to
the
hall
attended
by
francis
the
next
day
the
doctor
drove
in
and
informed
them
the
jarvis
family
were
happily
settled
and
the
colonel
in
no
danger
excepting
from
the
fascinations
of
the
two
young
ladies
who
took
such
palpable
care
of
him
that
he
wanted
for
nothing
and
they
might
drive
over
whenever
they
pleased
without
fear
of
intruding
unseasonably
jarvis
received
his
guests
with
the
frankness
of
good
feelings
if
not
with
the
polish
of
high
life
while
his
wife
who
seldom
thought
of
the
former
would
have
been
mortally
offended
with
the
person
who
could
have
suggested
that
she
omitted
any
of
the
elegancies
of
the
latter
her
daughters
were
rather
pretty
but
wanted
both
in
appearance
and
manner
the
inexpressible
air
of
haut
ton
which
so
eminently
distinguished
the
easy
but
polished
deportment
of
colonel
egerton
whom
they
found
reclining
on
a
sofa
with
his
leg
on
a
chair
amply
secured
in
numerous
bandages
but
unable
to
rise
notwithstanding
the
awkwardness
of
his
situation
he
was
by
far
the
least
discomposed
person
of
the
party
and
having
pleasantly
excused
himself
he
appeared
to
think
no
more
of
the
matter
the
captain
jarvis
remarked
had
gone
out
with
his
dogs
to
try
the
grounds
around
them
for
he
seems
to
live
only
with
his
horses
and
his
gun
young
men
my
lady
nowadays
appear
to
forget
that
there
are
any
things
in
the
world
but
themselves
now
i
told
harry
that
your
ladyship
and
daughters
would
favor
us
with
a
call
this
morning
but
no
there
he
went
as
if
jarvis
was
unable
to
buy
us
a
dinner
and
we
should
all
starve
but
for
his
quails
and
pheasants
quails
and
pheasants
cried
john
in
consternation
does
captain
jarvis
shoot
quails
and
pheasants
at
this
time
of
the
year
jarvis
sir
said
colonel
egerton
with
a
correcting
smile
understands
the
allegiance
due
from
us
gentlemen
to
the
ladies
better
than
the
rules
of
sporting
my
friend
the
captain
has
taken
his
fishing
rod
i
believe
it
is
all
one
fish
or
birds
continued
jarvis
he
is
out
of
the
way
when
he
is
wanted
and
i
believe
we
can
buy
fish
as
easily
as
birds
i
wish
he
would
take
pattern
after
yourself
colonel
in
these
matters
colonel
egerton
laughed
pleasantly
but
he
did
not
blush
and
miss
jarvis
observed
with
a
look
of
something
like
admiration
thrown
on
his
reclining
figure
that
when
harry
had
been
in
the
army
as
long
as
his
friend
he
would
know
the
usages
of
good
society
she
hoped
as
well
yes
said
her
mother
the
army
is
certainly
the
place
to
polish
a
young
man
and
turning
to
wilson
she
abruptly
added
your
husband
i
believe
was
in
the
army
i
hope
said
emily
hastily
that
we
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
soon
miss
jarvis
at
the
hall
preventing
by
her
promptitude
the
necessity
of
a
reply
from
her
aunt
the
young
lady
promised
to
make
an
early
visit
and
the
subject
changed
to
a
general
and
uninteresting
discourse
on
the
neighborhood
the
country
the
weather
and
other
ordinary
topics
now
john
cried
jane
in
triumph
as
they
drove
from
the
door
you
must
acknowledge
my
heraldic
witchcraft
as
you
are
pleased
to
call
it
is
right
for
once
at
least
oh
no
doubt
jenny
said
john
who
was
accustomed
to
use
that
appellation
to
her
as
a
provocation
when
he
wished
what
he
called
an
enlivening
scene
but
wilson
put
a
damper
on
his
hopes
by
a
remark
to
his
mother
and
the
habitual
respect
of
both
the
combatants
kept
them
silent
jane
moseley
was
endowed
by
nature
with
an
excellent
understanding
one
at
least
equal
to
that
of
her
brother
but
the
wanted
the
more
essential
requisites
of
a
well
governed
mind
masters
had
been
provided
by
sir
edward
for
all
his
daughters
and
if
they
were
not
acquainted
with
the
usual
acquirements
of
young
women
in
their
rank
of
life
it
was
not
his
fault
his
system
of
economy
had
not
embraced
a
denial
of
opportunity
to
any
of
his
children
and
the
baronet
was
apt
to
think
all
was
done
when
they
were
put
where
all
might
be
done
feeling
herself
and
parents
entitled
to
enter
into
all
the
gaieties
and
splendors
of
some
of
the
richer
families
in
their
vicinity
jane
who
had
grown
up
during
the
temporary
eclipse
of
sir
edward
fortunes
had
sought
that
consolation
so
common
to
people
in
her
situation
which
was
to
be
found
in
reviewing
the
former
grandeur
of
her
house
and
she
had
thus
contracted
a
degree
of
family
pride
if
clara
weaknesses
were
less
striking
than
those
of
jane
it
was
because
she
had
less
imagination
and
because
that
in
loving
francis
ives
she
had
so
long
admired
a
character
where
so
little
was
to
be
found
that
could
be
censured
that
she
might
be
said
to
have
contracted
a
habit
of
judging
correctly
without
being
able
at
all
times
to
give
a
reason
for
her
conduct
or
her
opinions
chapter
iii
the
day
fixed
for
one
of
the
stated
visits
of
benfield
had
now
arrived
and
john
with
emily
who
was
the
old
bachelor
favorite
niece
went
in
the
baronet
to
the
town
of
f
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
to
meet
him
in
order
to
accompany
him
in
the
remainder
of
his
journey
to
the
hall
it
being
a
settled
rule
with
the
old
man
that
his
carriage
horses
should
return
to
their
own
stables
every
night
where
he
imagined
they
could
alone
find
that
comfort
and
care
to
which
their
age
and
services
gave
them
a
claim
the
day
was
uncommonly
pleasant
and
the
young
people
were
in
high
spirits
with
the
expectation
of
meeting
their
respected
relative
whose
absence
had
been
prolonged
a
few
days
by
a
severe
fit
of
the
gout
now
emily
cried
john
as
he
settled
himself
comfortably
by
the
side
of
his
sister
in
the
chaise
let
me
know
honestly
how
you
like
the
jarvis
and
particularly
how
you
like
the
handsome
colonel
then
john
honestly
i
neither
like
nor
dislike
the
jarvis
or
the
handsome
colonel
well
then
there
is
no
great
diversity
in
our
sentiments
as
jane
would
say
john
emily
i
do
not
like
to
hear
you
speak
so
disrespectfully
of
out
sister
whom
i
am
sure
you
love
as
tenderly
as
i
do
myself
i
acknowledge
my
error
said
the
brother
taking
her
hand
and
affectionately
kissing
it
and
will
endeavor
to
offend
no
more
but
this
colonel
egerton
sister
is
certainly
a
gentleman
both
by
blood
and
in
manners
as
jane
emily
interrupted
him
with
a
laugh
which
john
took
very
repeating
his
remark
without
alluding
to
their
sister
yes
said
emily
he
is
genteel
in
his
deportment
if
that
be
what
you
mean
i
know
nothing
of
his
family
oh
i
have
taken
a
peep
into
jane
baronetage
where
find
him
set
down
as
sir
edgar
heir
there
is
something
about
him
said
emily
musing
that
i
do
not
much
admire
he
is
too
easy
there
is
no
nature
i
always
feel
afraid
such
people
will
laugh
at
me
as
soon
as
my
back
is
turned
and
for
those
very
things
they
seem
most
to
admire
to
my
face
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
judge
i
should
say
his
manner
wants
one
thing
without
which
no
one
can
be
truly
agreeable
what
that
sincerity
ah
that
my
great
recommendation
but
i
am
afraid
i
shall
have
to
take
the
poacher
up
with
his
quails
and
his
pheasants
indeed
you
know
the
colonel
explained
that
to
be
a
mistake
what
they
call
explaining
away
but
unluckily
i
saw
the
gentleman
returning
with
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
followed
by
a
brace
of
pointers
there
a
specimen
of
the
colonel
manners
then
said
emily
smiling
it
will
do
until
the
truth
be
known
and
jane
when
she
saw
him
also
praised
his
good
nature
and
consideration
in
what
she
was
pleased
to
call
relieving
the
awkwardness
of
my
remark
emily
finding
her
brother
disposed
to
dwell
on
the
foibles
of
jane
a
thing
he
was
rather
addicted
to
at
times
was
silent
they
rode
some
distance
before
john
who
was
ever
as
ready
to
atone
as
he
was
to
offend
again
apologized
again
promised
reformation
and
during
the
remainder
of
the
ride
only
forgot
himself
twice
more
in
the
same
way
they
reached
f
two
hours
before
the
lumbering
coach
of
their
uncle
drove
into
the
yard
of
the
inn
and
had
sufficient
time
to
refresh
their
own
horses
for
the
journey
homewards
benfield
was
a
bachelor
of
eighty
but
retained
the
personal
activity
of
a
man
of
sixty
he
was
strongly
attached
to
all
the
fashions
and
opinions
of
his
youth
during
which
he
had
sat
one
term
in
parliament
having
been
a
great
beau
and
courtier
in
the
commencement
of
the
reign
a
disappointment
in
an
affair
of
the
heart
drove
him
into
retirement
and
for
the
last
fifty
years
he
had
dwelt
exclusively
at
a
seat
he
owned
within
forty
miles
of
moseley
hall
the
mistress
of
which
was
the
only
child
of
his
only
brother
in
figure
he
was
tall
and
spare
very
erect
for
his
years
and
he
faithfully
preserved
in
his
attire
servants
carriages
and
indeed
everything
around
him
as
much
of
the
fashions
of
his
youth
as
circumstances
would
allow
such
then
was
a
faint
outline
of
the
character
and
appearance
of
the
old
man
who
dressed
in
a
cocked
hat
bag
wig
and
sword
took
the
offered
arm
of
john
moseley
to
alight
from
his
coach
so
cried
the
old
gentleman
having
made
good
his
footing
on
the
ground
as
he
stopped
short
and
stared
john
in
the
face
you
have
made
out
to
come
twenty
miles
to
meet
an
old
cynic
have
you
sir
but
i
thought
i
bid
thee
bring
emmy
with
thee
john
pointed
to
the
window
where
his
sister
stood
anxiously
watching
her
uncle
movements
on
catching
her
eye
he
smiled
kindly
and
pursued
his
way
into
the
house
talking
to
himself
aye
there
she
is
indeed
i
remember
now
when
i
was
a
youngster
of
going
with
my
kinsman
old
lord
gosford
to
meet
his
sister
the
lady
juliana
when
she
first
came
from
school
this
was
the
lady
whose
infidelity
had
driven
him
from
the
world
and
a
beauty
she
was
indeed
something
like
emmy
there
only
she
was
taller
and
her
eyes
were
black
and
her
hair
too
that
was
black
and
she
was
not
so
fair
as
emmy
and
she
was
fatter
and
she
stooped
a
little
very
little
oh
they
are
wonderfully
alike
though
do
you
think
they
were
nephew
he
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
room
while
john
who
in
this
description
could
not
see
a
resemblance
which
existed
nowhere
but
in
the
old
affections
was
fain
to
say
yes
but
they
were
related
you
know
uncle
and
that
explains
the
likeness
true
boy
true
said
his
uncle
pleased
at
a
reason
for
a
thing
he
wished
and
which
flattered
his
propensities
he
had
once
before
told
emily
she
put
him
in
mind
of
his
housekeeper
a
woman
as
old
as
himself
and
without
a
tooth
in
her
head
on
meeting
his
niece
benfield
who
like
many
others
that
feel
strongly
wore
in
common
the
affectation
of
indifference
and
displeasure
yielded
to
his
fondness
and
folding
her
in
his
arms
kissed
her
affectionately
while
a
tear
glistened
in
his
eye
and
then
pushing
her
gently
from
him
he
exclaimed
come
come
emmy
strangle
me
do
strangle
me
girl
let
me
live
in
peace
the
little
while
i
have
to
remain
here
so
seating
himself
composedly
in
an
arm
chair
his
niece
had
placed
for
him
with
a
cushion
so
anne
writes
me
sir
william
harris
has
let
the
deanery
oh
yes
uncle
cried
john
i
thank
you
young
gentleman
said
benfield
sternly
not
to
interrupt
me
when
i
am
speaking
to
a
lady
that
is
if
you
please
sir
then
sir
william
has
let
the
deanery
to
a
london
merchant
a
jarvis
now
i
knew
three
people
of
that
name
one
was
a
hackney
coachman
when
i
was
a
member
of
the
parliament
of
this
realm
and
drove
me
often
to
the
house
the
other
was
to
my
lord
gosford
and
the
third
i
take
it
is
the
very
man
who
has
become
your
neighbor
if
it
be
the
person
i
mean
emmy
dear
he
is
like
like
aye
very
like
old
peter
my
steward
john
unable
to
contain
his
mirth
at
this
discovery
of
a
likeness
between
the
prototype
of
benfield
himself
in
leanness
of
figure
and
the
jolly
rotundity
of
the
merchant
was
obliged
to
leave
the
room
emily
though
she
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
the
comparison
quietly
said
you
will
meet
him
dear
uncle
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
judge
for
yourself
yes
yes
muttered
the
old
man
very
like
old
peter
my
steward
as
like
as
two
peas
the
parallel
was
by
no
means
as
ridiculous
as
might
be
supposed
its
history
being
as
follows
benfield
had
placed
twenty
thousand
pounds
in
the
hands
of
a
broker
with
positive
orders
for
him
to
pay
it
away
immediately
for
government
stock
bought
by
the
former
on
his
account
but
disregarding
this
injunction
the
broker
had
managed
the
transaction
in
such
a
way
as
to
postpone
the
payment
until
on
his
failure
he
had
given
up
that
and
a
much
larger
sum
to
jarvis
to
satisfy
what
he
called
an
honorary
debt
in
elucidating
the
transaction
jarvis
paid
benfield
lodge
a
visit
and
honestly
restored
the
bachelor
his
property
this
act
and
the
high
opinion
he
entertained
of
wilson
with
his
unbounded
love
for
emily
were
the
few
things
which
prevented
his
believing
some
dreadful
judgment
was
about
to
visit
this
world
for
its
increasing
wickedness
and
follies
as
his
own
steward
was
one
of
the
honestest
fellows
living
he
had
ever
after
fancied
that
there
was
a
personal
resemblance
between
him
and
the
conscientious
merchant
the
horses
being
ready
the
old
bachelor
was
placed
carefully
between
his
nephew
and
niece
and
in
that
manner
they
rode
on
quietly
to
the
hall
the
dread
of
accident
keeping
benfield
silent
most
of
the
way
on
passing
however
a
stately
castle
about
ten
miles
from
the
termination
of
their
ride
he
began
one
of
his
speeches
with
emmy
dear
does
lord
bolton
come
often
to
see
you
very
seldom
sir
his
employment
keeps
him
much
of
his
time
at
james
and
then
he
has
an
estate
in
ireland
i
knew
his
father
well
he
was
distantly
connected
by
marriage
with
my
friend
lord
gosford
you
could
not
remember
him
i
suspect
john
rolled
his
eyes
at
this
suggestion
of
his
sister
recollection
of
a
man
who
had
been
forty
years
dead
he
always
voted
with
me
in
the
parliament
of
this
realm
he
was
a
thoroughly
honest
man
very
much
such
a
man
to
look
at
as
peter
johnson
my
steward
but
i
am
told
his
son
likes
the
good
things
of
the
ministry
well
well
william
pitt
was
the
only
minister
to
my
mind
there
was
the
scotchman
of
whom
they
made
a
marquis
i
never
could
endure
him
always
voted
against
him
right
or
wrong
uncle
cried
john
who
loved
a
little
mischief
in
his
heart
no
sir
right
but
never
wrong
lord
gosford
always
voted
against
him
too
and
do
you
think
jackanapes
that
my
friend
the
earl
of
gosford
and
and
myself
were
ever
wrong
no
sir
men
in
my
day
were
different
creatures
from
what
they
are
now
we
were
never
wrong
sir
we
loved
our
country
and
had
no
motive
for
being
in
the
wrong
how
was
it
with
lord
bute
uncle
lord
bute
sir
cried
the
old
man
with
great
warmth
was
the
minister
sir
he
was
the
minister
aye
he
was
the
minister
sir
and
was
paid
for
what
he
did
but
lord
chatham
was
he
not
the
minister
too
now
nothing
vexed
the
old
gentleman
more
than
to
hear
william
pitt
called
by
his
tardy
honors
and
yet
unwilling
to
give
up
what
he
thought
his
political
opinions
he
exclaimed
with
an
unanswerable
positiveness
of
argument
billy
pitt
sir
was
the
minister
sir
but
but
but
he
was
our
minister
sir
emily
unable
to
see
her
uncle
agitated
by
such
useless
disputes
threw
a
reproachful
glance
on
her
brother
as
she
observed
timidly
that
was
a
glorious
administration
sir
i
believe
glorious
indeed
emmy
dear
said
the
bachelor
softening
with
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
the
recollections
of
his
younger
days
we
beat
the
french
everywhere
in
america
in
germany
we
took
counting
on
his
fingers
we
took
quebec
yes
lord
gosford
lost
a
cousin
there
and
we
took
all
the
canadas
and
we
took
their
fleets
there
was
a
young
man
killed
in
the
battle
between
hawke
and
conflans
who
was
much
attached
to
lady
juliana
poor
soul
how
much
she
regretted
him
when
dead
though
she
never
could
abide
him
when
living
ah
she
was
a
creature
benfield
like
many
others
continued
to
love
imaginary
qualities
in
his
mistress
long
after
her
heartless
coquetry
had
disgusted
him
with
her
person
a
kind
of
feeling
which
springs
from
which
finds
it
necessary
to
seek
consolation
in
creating
beauties
that
may
justify
our
follies
to
ourselves
and
which
often
keeps
alive
the
semblance
of
the
passion
when
even
hope
or
real
admiration
is
extinct
on
reaching
the
hall
every
one
was
rejoiced
to
see
their
really
affectionate
and
worthy
relative
and
the
evening
passed
in
the
tranquil
enjoyment
of
the
blessings
which
providence
had
profusely
scattered
around
the
family
of
the
baronet
but
which
are
too
often
hazarded
by
a
neglect
of
duty
that
springs
from
too
great
security
or
an
indolence
which
renders
us
averse
to
the
precaution
necessary
to
insure
their
continuance
chapter
iv
you
are
welcome
sir
edward
said
the
venerable
rector
as
he
took
the
baronet
by
the
hand
i
was
fearful
a
return
of
your
rheumatism
would
deprive
us
of
this
pleasure
and
prevent
my
making
you
acquainted
with
the
new
occupants
of
the
deanery
who
have
consented
to
dine
with
us
day
and
to
whom
i
have
promised
in
particular
an
introduction
to
sir
edward
moseley
i
thank
you
my
dear
doctor
rejoined
the
baronet
i
have
not
only
come
myself
but
have
persuaded
benfield
to
make
one
of
the
party
there
he
comes
leaning
on
emily
arm
and
finding
fault
with
wilson
barouche
which
he
says
has
given
him
cold
the
rector
received
the
unexpected
guest
with
the
kindness
of
his
nature
and
an
inward
smile
at
the
incongruous
assemblage
he
was
likely
to
have
around
him
by
the
arrival
of
the
jarvis
who
at
that
moment
drove
to
his
door
the
introductions
between
the
baronet
and
the
new
comers
had
passed
and
miss
jarvis
had
made
a
prettily
worded
apology
on
behalf
of
the
colonel
who
was
not
yet
well
enough
to
come
out
but
whose
politeness
had
insisted
on
their
not
remaining
a
home
on
his
account
as
benfield
having
composedly
put
on
his
spectacles
walked
deliberately
up
to
the
place
where
the
merchant
had
seated
himself
and
having
examined
him
through
his
glasses
to
his
satisfaction
took
them
off
and
carefully
wiping
them
he
began
to
talk
to
himself
as
he
put
them
into
his
pocket
no
no
it
not
jack
the
hackney
coachman
nor
my
lord
gosford
gentleman
but
cordially
holding
out
both
hands
it
the
man
who
saved
my
twenty
thousand
pounds
jarvis
whom
shame
and
embarrassment
had
kept
silent
during
this
examination
exchanged
greetings
sincerely
with
his
old
acquaintance
who
now
took
a
seat
in
silence
by
his
side
while
his
wife
whose
face
had
begun
to
kindle
with
indignation
at
the
commencement
of
the
old
gentleman
soliloquy
observing
that
somehow
or
other
it
had
not
only
terminated
without
degradation
to
her
spouse
but
with
something
like
credit
turned
complacently
to
ives
with
an
apology
for
the
absence
of
her
son
i
can
not
divine
where
he
has
got
to
he
is
ever
keeping
us
waiting
for
him
and
addressing
jane
these
military
men
become
so
unsettled
in
their
habits
that
i
often
tell
harry
he
should
never
quit
the
camp
in
hyde
park
you
should
add
my
dear
for
he
has
never
been
in
any
other
bluntly
observed
her
husband
to
this
speech
no
reply
was
made
but
it
was
evidently
little
relished
by
the
ladies
of
the
family
who
were
a
good
deal
jealous
of
the
laurels
of
the
only
hero
their
race
had
ever
produced
the
arrival
and
introduction
of
the
captain
himself
changed
the
discourse
which
turned
on
the
comforts
of
their
present
residence
pray
my
lady
cried
the
captain
who
had
taken
a
chair
familiarly
by
the
side
of
the
baronet
wife
why
is
the
house
called
the
deanery
i
am
afraid
i
shall
be
taken
for
a
son
of
the
church
when
i
invite
my
friends
to
visit
my
father
at
the
deanery
but
you
may
add
at
the
same
time
sir
if
you
please
dryly
remarked
jarvis
that
it
is
occupied
by
an
old
man
who
has
been
preaching
and
lecturing
all
his
life
and
like
others
of
the
trade
i
believe
in
vain
you
must
except
our
good
friend
the
doctor
here
at
least
sir
said
wilson
who
observing
that
her
sister
shrank
from
a
familiarity
she
was
unused
to
took
upon
herself
the
office
of
replying
to
the
captain
question
the
father
of
the
present
sir
william
harris
held
that
station
in
the
church
and
although
the
house
was
his
private
property
it
took
its
name
from
the
circumstance
which
has
been
continued
ever
since
is
it
not
a
droll
life
sir
william
leads
cried
miss
jarvis
looking
at
john
moseley
riding
about
all
summer
from
one
to
another
and
letting
his
house
year
after
year
in
the
manner
he
does
sir
william
said
ives
gravely
is
devoted
to
his
wishes
and
since
his
accession
to
his
title
has
come
into
possession
of
another
residence
in
an
adjoining
county
which
i
believe
he
retains
in
his
own
hands
are
you
acquainted
with
miss
harris
continued
the
lady
addressing
herself
to
clara
though
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
added
she
is
a
great
belle
all
the
gentlemen
are
dying
for
her
or
her
fortune
said
her
sister
with
a
pretty
toss
of
the
head
for
my
part
i
never
could
see
anything
so
captivating
in
her
although
so
much
is
said
about
her
at
bath
and
brighton
you
know
her
then
mildly
observed
clara
why
i
can
not
say
we
are
exactly
acquainted
the
young
lady
hesitatingly
answered
coloring
violently
what
do
you
mean
by
exactly
acquainted
sally
put
in
the
father
with
a
laugh
did
you
ever
speak
to
or
were
you
ever
in
a
room
with
her
in
your
life
unless
it
might
be
at
a
concert
or
a
ball
the
mortification
of
miss
sarah
was
too
evident
for
concealment
and
it
happily
was
relieved
by
a
summons
to
dinner
never
my
dear
child
said
wilson
to
emily
the
aunt
being
fond
of
introducing
a
moral
from
the
occasional
incidents
of
life
never
subject
yourself
to
a
similar
mortification
by
commenting
on
the
characters
of
those
you
do
know
ignorance
makes
you
liable
to
great
errors
and
if
they
should
happen
to
be
above
you
in
life
it
will
only
excite
their
contempt
should
it
reach
their
ears
while
those
to
whom
your
remarks
are
made
will
think
it
envy
truth
is
sometimes
blundered
on
whispered
john
who
held
his
arm
waiting
for
his
aunt
to
precede
them
to
the
the
merchant
paid
too
great
a
compliment
to
the
rector
dinner
to
think
of
renewing
the
disagreeable
conversation
and
as
john
moseley
and
the
young
clergyman
were
seated
next
the
two
ladies
they
soon
forgot
what
among
themselves
they
would
call
their
father
rudeness
in
receiving
the
attentions
of
a
couple
of
remarkably
agreeable
young
men
pray
francis
when
do
you
preach
for
us
asked
haughton
very
anxious
to
hear
you
hold
forth
from
the
pulpit
where
i
have
so
often
heard
your
father
with
pleasure
i
doubt
not
you
will
prove
orthodox
or
you
will
be
the
only
man
i
believe
in
the
congregation
the
rector
has
left
in
ignorance
of
the
theory
of
our
religion
at
least
the
doctor
bowed
to
the
compliment
as
he
replied
to
the
question
for
his
son
that
on
the
next
sunday
they
were
to
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
frank
who
had
promised
to
assist
him
on
that
day
any
prospects
of
a
living
soon
continued
haughton
helping
himself
bountifully
to
a
piece
of
plum
pudding
as
he
spoke
john
moseley
laughed
aloud
and
clara
blushed
to
the
eyes
while
the
doctor
turning
to
sir
edward
observed
with
an
air
of
interest
sir
edward
the
living
of
bolton
is
vacant
and
i
should
like
exceedingly
to
obtain
it
for
my
son
the
advowson
belongs
to
the
earl
who
will
dispose
of
it
only
to
great
interest
i
am
afraid
clara
was
certainly
too
busily
occupied
in
picking
raisins
from
her
pudding
to
hear
this
remark
but
accidentally
stole
from
under
her
long
eyelashes
a
timid
glance
at
her
father
as
he
replied
i
am
sorry
my
friend
i
have
not
sufficient
interest
with
his
lordship
to
apply
on
my
own
account
but
he
is
so
seldom
here
we
are
barely
acquainted
and
the
good
baronet
looked
really
concerned
clara
said
francis
ives
in
a
low
and
affectionate
tone
have
you
read
the
books
i
sent
you
clara
answered
him
with
a
smile
in
the
negative
but
promised
amendment
as
soon
as
she
had
leisure
do
you
ride
much
on
horseback
mr
moseley
abruptly
asked
miss
sarah
turning
her
back
on
the
young
divine
and
facing
the
gentleman
she
addressed
john
who
was
now
hemmed
in
between
the
sisters
replied
with
a
rueful
expression
that
brought
a
smile
into
the
face
of
emily
who
was
placed
opposite
to
him
yes
and
sometimes
i
am
ridden
ridden
sir
what
do
you
mean
by
that
oh
only
my
aunt
there
occasionally
gives
me
a
lecture
i
understand
said
the
lady
pointing
slily
with
her
finger
at
her
own
father
does
it
feel
good
john
inquired
with
a
look
of
great
sympathy
but
the
lady
who
now
felt
awkwardly
without
knowing
exactly
why
shook
her
head
in
silence
and
forced
a
faint
laugh
whom
have
we
here
cried
captain
jarvis
who
was
looking
out
at
a
window
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
approach
to
the
house
the
apothecary
and
his
attendant
judging
from
the
equipage
the
rector
threw
an
inquiring
look
on
a
servant
who
told
his
master
they
were
strangers
to
him
have
them
shown
up
doctor
cried
the
benevolent
baronet
who
loved
to
see
every
one
as
happy
as
himself
and
give
them
some
of
your
excellent
pasty
for
the
sake
of
hospitality
and
the
credit
of
your
cook
i
beg
of
you
as
this
request
was
politely
seconded
by
others
of
the
party
the
rector
ordered
his
servants
to
show
in
the
strangers
on
opening
the
parlor
door
a
gentleman
apparently
sixty
years
of
age
appeared
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
youth
of
there
was
sufficient
resemblance
between
the
two
for
the
most
indifferent
observer
to
pronounce
them
father
and
son
but
the
helpless
debility
and
emaciated
figure
of
the
former
were
finely
contrasted
by
the
vigorous
health
and
manly
beauty
of
the
latter
who
supported
his
venerable
parent
into
the
room
with
a
grace
and
tenderness
that
struck
most
of
the
beholders
with
a
sensation
of
pleasure
the
doctor
and
ives
rose
from
their
seats
involuntarily
and
each
stood
for
a
moment
lost
in
an
astonishment
that
was
mingled
with
grief
recollecting
himself
the
rector
grasped
the
extended
hand
of
the
senior
in
both
his
own
and
endeavored
to
utter
something
but
in
vain
the
tears
followed
each
other
down
his
cheeks
as
he
looked
on
the
faded
and
careworn
figure
which
stood
before
him
while
his
wife
unable
to
control
her
feelings
sank
back
into
a
chair
and
wept
aloud
throwing
open
the
door
of
an
adjoining
room
and
retaining
the
hand
of
the
invalid
the
doctor
gently
led
the
way
followed
by
his
wife
and
son
the
former
having
recovered
from
the
first
burst
of
her
sorrow
and
regardless
of
everything
else
now
anxiously
watched
the
enfeebled
step
of
the
stranger
on
reaching
the
door
they
both
turned
and
bowed
to
the
company
in
a
manner
of
so
much
dignity
mingled
with
sweetness
that
all
not
excepting
benfield
rose
from
their
seats
to
return
the
salutation
on
passing
from
the
dining
parlor
the
door
was
closed
leaving
the
company
standing
round
the
table
in
mute
astonishment
and
commiseration
not
a
word
had
been
spoken
and
the
rector
family
had
left
them
without
apology
or
explanation
francis
however
soon
returned
and
was
followed
in
a
few
minutes
by
his
mother
who
slightly
apologizing
for
her
absence
turned
the
discourse
on
the
approaching
sunday
and
the
intention
of
francis
to
preach
on
that
day
the
moseleys
were
too
well
bred
to
make
any
inquiries
and
the
deanery
family
was
afraid
sir
edward
retired
at
a
very
early
hour
and
was
followed
by
the
remainder
of
the
party
well
cried
jarvis
as
they
drove
from
the
door
this
may
be
good
breeding
but
for
my
part
i
think
both
the
doctor
and
ives
behaved
very
rudely
with
the
crying
and
sobbing
they
are
nobody
of
much
consequence
cried
her
eldest
daughter
casting
a
contemptuous
glance
on
a
plain
travelling
chaise
which
stood
before
the
rector
stables
was
sickening
said
miss
sarah
with
a
shrug
while
her
father
turning
his
eyes
on
each
speaker
in
succession
very
deliberately
helped
himself
to
a
pinch
of
snuff
his
ordinary
recourse
against
a
family
quarrel
the
curiosity
of
the
ladies
was
however
more
lively
than
they
chose
to
avow
and
jarvis
bade
her
maid
go
over
to
the
rectory
that
evening
with
her
compliments
to
ives
she
had
lost
a
lace
veil
which
her
maid
knew
and
she
thought
it
might
have
been
left
at
the
rectory
and
jones
when
you
are
there
you
can
inquire
of
the
servants
mind
of
the
servants
i
would
not
distress
ives
for
the
world
how
what
his
name
oh
i
have
forgotten
his
name
just
bring
me
his
name
too
jones
and
as
it
may
make
some
difference
in
our
party
just
find
out
how
long
they
stay
and
and
any
other
little
thing
jones
which
can
be
of
use
you
know
off
went
jones
and
within
an
hour
she
had
returned
with
an
important
look
she
commenced
her
narrative
the
daughters
being
accidentally
present
and
it
might
be
on
purpose
why
i
went
across
the
fields
and
william
was
good
enough
to
go
with
me
so
when
we
got
there
i
rang
and
they
showed
us
into
the
servants
room
and
i
gave
my
message
and
the
veil
was
not
there
why
there
the
veil
now
on
the
back
o
that
chair
very
well
very
well
jones
never
mind
the
veil
cried
the
impatient
mistress
so
while
they
were
looking
for
the
veil
i
just
asked
one
of
the
maids
what
company
had
arrived
but
here
jones
looked
very
suspicious
and
shook
her
head
ominously
would
you
think
it
not
a
soul
of
them
knew
but
there
was
the
doctor
and
his
son
praying
and
reading
with
the
old
gentleman
the
whole
time
and
and
what
jones
why
i
expect
he
has
been
a
great
sinner
or
he
would
want
so
much
praying
just
as
he
is
about
to
die
die
cried
all
three
at
once
will
he
die
o
yes
continued
jones
they
all
agree
he
must
die
but
this
praying
so
much
is
just
like
the
criminals
i
sure
no
honest
person
needs
so
much
praying
no
indeed
said
the
mother
no
indeed
responded
the
daughters
as
they
retired
to
their
several
rooms
for
the
night
chapter
there
is
something
in
the
season
of
spring
which
peculiarly
excites
the
feelings
of
devotion
the
dreariness
of
winter
has
passed
and
with
it
the
deadened
affections
of
our
nature
new
life
new
vigor
arises
within
us
as
we
walk
abroad
and
feel
the
genial
gales
of
april
breathe
upon
us
and
our
hopes
our
wishes
awaken
with
the
revival
of
the
vegetable
world
it
is
then
that
the
heart
which
has
been
impressed
with
the
goodness
of
the
creator
feels
that
goodness
brought
as
it
were
into
very
contact
with
the
senses
the
eye
loves
to
wander
over
the
bountiful
provisions
nature
is
throwing
forth
in
every
direction
for
our
comfort
and
fixes
its
gaze
on
the
clouds
which
having
lost
the
chilling
thinness
of
winter
roll
in
rich
volumes
amidst
the
clear
and
softened
fields
of
azure
so
peculiar
to
the
season
leading
the
mind
insensibly
to
dwell
on
the
things
of
another
and
a
better
world
it
was
on
such
a
day
that
the
inhabitants
of
b
thronged
toward
the
village
church
for
the
double
purpose
of
pouring
out
their
thanksgivings
and
of
hearing
the
first
efforts
of
their
rector
son
in
the
duties
of
his
sacred
calling
amongst
the
crowd
whom
curiosity
or
a
better
feeling
had
drawn
forth
were
to
be
seen
the
flaring
equipage
of
the
jarvises
and
the
handsome
carriages
of
sir
edward
moseley
and
his
sister
all
the
members
of
the
latter
family
felt
a
lively
anxiety
for
the
success
of
the
young
divine
but
knowing
as
they
well
did
the
strength
of
his
native
talents
the
excellence
of
his
education
and
the
fervor
of
his
piety
it
was
an
anxiety
that
partook
more
of
hope
than
of
fear
there
was
one
heart
however
amongst
them
that
palpitated
with
an
emotion
that
hardly
admitted
of
control
as
they
approached
the
sacred
edifice
for
it
had
identified
itself
completely
with
the
welfare
of
the
rector
son
there
never
was
a
softer
truer
heart
than
that
which
now
almost
audibly
beat
within
the
bosom
of
clara
moseley
and
she
had
given
it
to
the
young
divine
with
all
its
purity
and
truth
the
entrance
of
a
congregation
into
the
sanctuary
will
at
all
times
furnish
to
an
attentive
observer
food
for
much
useful
speculation
if
it
be
chastened
with
a
proper
charity
for
the
weaknesses
of
others
and
most
people
are
ignorant
of
the
insight
they
are
giving
into
their
characters
and
dispositions
by
such
an
apparently
trivial
circumstance
as
their
weekly
approach
to
the
tabernacles
of
the
lord
christianity
while
it
chastens
and
amends
the
heart
leaves
the
natural
powers
unaltered
and
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
its
operation
is
or
ought
to
be
proportionate
to
the
abilities
and
opportunities
of
the
subject
of
its
holy
impression
unto
whomsoever
much
is
given
much
will
be
required
while
we
acknowledge
that
the
thoughts
might
be
better
employed
in
preparing
for
those
humiliations
of
the
spirit
and
thanksgiving
of
the
heart
which
are
required
of
all
and
are
so
necessary
to
all
we
must
be
indulged
in
a
hasty
view
of
some
of
the
personages
of
our
history
as
they
entered
the
church
of
b
on
the
countenance
of
the
baronet
was
the
dignity
and
composure
of
a
mind
at
peace
with
itself
and
mankind
his
step
was
rather
more
deliberate
than
common
his
eye
rested
on
the
pavement
and
on
turning
into
his
pew
as
he
prepared
to
kneel
in
the
first
humble
petition
of
our
beautiful
service
he
raised
it
towards
the
altar
with
an
expression
of
benevolence
and
reverence
that
spoke
contentment
not
unmixed
with
faith
in
the
demeanor
of
lady
moseley
all
was
graceful
and
decent
while
nothing
could
be
properly
said
to
be
studied
she
followed
her
husband
with
a
step
of
equal
deliberation
though
it
was
slightly
varied
by
a
manner
which
while
it
appeared
natural
to
herself
might
have
been
artificial
in
another
a
cambric
handkerchief
concealed
her
face
as
she
sank
composedly
by
the
side
of
sir
edward
in
a
style
which
showed
that
while
she
remembered
her
maker
she
had
not
entirely
forgotten
herself
the
walk
of
wilson
was
quicker
than
that
of
her
sister
her
eye
directed
before
her
was
fixed
as
if
in
settled
gaze
on
that
eternity
which
she
was
approaching
the
lines
of
her
contemplative
face
were
unaltered
unless
there
might
be
traced
a
deeper
shade
of
humility
than
was
ordinarily
seen
on
her
pale
but
expressive
countenance
her
petition
was
long
and
on
rising
from
her
humble
posture
the
person
was
indeed
to
be
seen
but
the
soul
appeared
absorbed
in
contemplations
beyond
the
limits
of
this
sphere
there
was
a
restlessness
and
varying
of
color
in
the
ordinarily
placid
clara
which
prevented
a
display
of
her
usual
manner
while
jane
walked
gracefully
and
with
a
tincture
of
her
mother
manner
by
her
side
she
stole
one
hastily
withdrawn
glance
to
the
deanery
pew
ere
she
kneeled
and
then
on
rising
handed
her
affectionately
to
her
elder
sister
emily
glided
behind
her
companions
with
a
face
beaming
with
a
look
of
innocence
and
love
as
she
sank
in
the
act
of
supplication
the
rich
glow
of
her
healthful
cheek
lost
some
of
its
brilliancy
but
on
rising
it
beamed
with
a
renewed
lustre
that
plainly
indicated
a
heart
touched
with
the
sanctity
of
its
situation
in
the
composed
and
sedate
manner
of
jarvis
as
he
steadily
pursued
his
way
to
the
pew
of
sir
william
harris
you
might
have
been
justified
in
expecting
the
entrance
of
another
sir
edward
moseley
in
substance
if
not
in
externals
but
the
deliberate
separation
of
the
flaps
of
his
coat
as
he
comfortably
seated
himself
when
you
thought
him
about
to
kneel
followed
by
a
pinch
of
snuff
as
he
threw
his
eye
around
the
building
led
you
at
once
to
conjecture
that
what
at
first
had
been
mistaken
for
reverence
was
the
abstraction
of
some
earthly
calculation
and
that
his
attendance
was
in
compliance
with
custom
and
not
a
little
depended
upon
the
thickness
of
his
cushions
and
the
room
he
found
for
the
disposition
of
two
rather
unwieldy
legs
the
ladies
of
the
family
followed
in
garments
carefully
selected
for
the
advantageous
display
of
their
persons
as
they
sailed
into
their
seats
where
it
would
seem
the
improvidence
of
sir
william
steward
had
neglected
some
important
accommodation
some
time
being
spent
in
preparation
to
be
seated
the
old
lady
whose
size
and
flesh
really
put
kneeling
out
of
the
question
bent
forward
for
a
moment
at
an
angle
of
eighty
with
the
horizon
while
her
daughters
prettily
bowed
their
heads
with
all
proper
precaution
for
the
safety
of
their
superb
millinery
at
length
the
rector
accompanied
by
his
son
appeared
from
the
vestry
there
was
a
dignity
and
solemnity
in
the
manner
in
which
this
pious
divine
entered
on
the
duties
of
his
profession
which
disposed
the
heart
to
listen
with
reverence
and
humility
to
precepts
that
were
accompanied
with
so
impressive
an
exterior
the
stillness
of
expectation
pervaded
the
church
when
the
pew
opener
led
the
way
to
the
same
interesting
father
and
son
whose
entrance
had
interrupted
the
guests
the
preceding
day
at
the
rectory
every
eye
was
turned
on
the
emaciated
parent
bending
into
the
grave
and
as
it
were
kept
from
it
by
the
supporting
tenderness
of
his
child
hastily
throwing
open
the
door
of
her
own
pew
ives
buried
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
her
husband
had
proceeded
far
in
the
morning
service
before
she
raised
it
again
to
the
view
of
the
congregation
in
the
voice
of
the
rector
there
was
an
unusual
softness
and
tremor
that
his
people
attributed
to
the
feelings
of
a
father
about
to
witness
the
first
efforts
of
an
only
child
but
which
in
reality
were
owing
to
another
and
a
deeper
cause
prayers
were
ended
and
the
younger
ives
ascended
the
pulpit
for
a
moment
he
paused
when
casting
an
anxious
glance
to
the
pew
of
the
baronet
he
commenced
his
sermon
he
had
chosen
for
his
discourse
the
necessity
of
placing
our
dependence
on
divine
grace
after
having
learnedly
but
in
the
most
unaffected
manner
displayed
the
necessity
of
this
dependence
as
derived
from
revelation
he
proceeded
to
paint
the
hope
the
resignation
the
felicity
of
a
christian
warmed
by
the
subject
his
animation
soon
lent
a
heightened
interest
to
his
language
and
at
a
moment
when
all
around
him
were
entranced
by
the
eloquence
of
the
youthful
divine
a
sudden
and
sigh
drew
every
eye
to
the
rector
pew
the
younger
stranger
sat
motionless
as
a
statue
holding
in
his
arms
the
lifeless
body
of
his
parent
who
had
fallen
that
moment
a
corpse
by
his
side
all
was
now
confusion
the
almost
insensible
young
man
was
relieved
from
his
burden
and
led
by
the
rector
they
left
the
church
the
congregation
dispersed
in
silence
or
assembled
in
little
groups
to
converse
on
the
awful
event
they
had
witnessed
none
knew
the
deceased
he
was
the
rector
friend
and
to
his
residence
the
body
was
removed
the
young
man
was
evidently
his
child
but
here
all
information
ended
they
had
arrived
in
a
private
chaise
but
with
post
horses
and
without
attendants
their
arrival
at
the
parsonage
was
detailed
by
the
jarvis
ladies
with
a
few
exaggerations
that
gave
additional
interest
to
the
whole
event
and
which
by
creating
an
impression
with
some
whom
gentler
feelings
would
not
have
restrained
that
there
was
something
of
mystery
about
them
prevented
many
distressing
questions
to
the
ives
that
the
baronet
family
forbore
putting
on
the
score
of
delicacy
the
body
left
b
at
the
close
of
the
week
accompanied
by
francis
ives
and
the
unweariedly
attentive
and
interesting
son
the
doctor
and
his
wife
went
into
deep
mourning
and
clara
received
a
short
note
from
her
lover
on
the
morning
of
their
departure
acquainting
her
with
his
intended
absence
for
a
month
but
throwing
no
light
upon
the
affair
the
london
papers
however
contained
the
following
obituary
notice
and
which
as
it
could
refer
to
no
other
person
as
a
matter
of
course
was
supposed
to
allude
to
the
friend
died
suddenly
at
b
on
the
instant
george
denbigh
aged
chapter
vi
during
the
week
of
mourning
the
intercourse
between
moseley
hall
and
the
rectory
was
confined
to
messages
and
notes
of
inquiry
after
each
other
welfare
but
the
visit
of
the
moseleys
to
the
deanery
had
been
returned
and
the
day
after
the
appearance
of
the
obituary
paragraph
the
family
of
the
latter
dined
by
invitation
at
the
hall
colonel
egerton
had
recovered
the
use
of
his
leg
and
was
included
in
the
party
between
this
gentleman
and
benfield
there
appeared
from
the
first
moment
of
their
introduction
a
repugnance
which
was
rather
increased
by
time
and
which
the
old
gentleman
manifested
by
a
demeanor
loaded
with
the
overstrained
ceremony
of
the
day
and
which
in
the
colonel
only
showed
itself
by
avoiding
when
possible
all
intercourse
with
the
object
of
his
aversion
both
sir
edward
and
lady
moseley
on
the
contrary
were
not
slow
in
manifesting
their
favorable
impressions
in
behalf
of
the
gentleman
the
latter
in
particular
having
ascertained
to
her
satisfaction
that
he
was
the
undoubted
heir
to
the
title
and
most
probably
to
the
estates
of
his
uncle
sir
edgar
egerton
felt
herself
strongly
disposed
to
encourage
an
acquaintance
she
found
so
agreeable
and
to
which
she
could
see
no
reasonable
objection
captain
jarvis
who
was
extremely
offensive
to
her
from
his
vulgar
familiarity
she
barely
tolerated
from
the
necessity
of
being
civil
and
keeping
up
sociability
in
the
neighborhood
it
is
true
she
could
not
help
being
surprised
that
a
gentleman
as
polished
as
the
colonel
could
find
any
pleasure
in
an
associate
like
his
friend
or
even
in
the
hardly
more
softened
females
of
his
family
then
again
the
flattering
suggestion
would
present
itself
that
possibly
he
might
have
seen
emily
at
bath
or
jane
elsewhere
and
availed
himself
of
the
acquaintance
of
young
jarvis
to
get
into
their
neighborhood
lady
moseley
had
never
been
vain
or
much
interested
about
the
disposal
of
her
own
person
previously
to
her
attachment
to
her
husband
but
her
daughters
called
forth
not
a
little
of
her
natural
pride
we
had
almost
said
of
her
selfishness
the
attentions
of
the
colonel
were
of
the
most
delicate
and
insinuating
kind
and
wilson
several
times
turned
away
in
displeasure
at
herself
for
listening
with
too
much
satisfaction
to
nothings
uttered
in
an
agreeable
manner
or
what
was
worse
false
sentiments
supported
with
the
gloss
of
language
and
a
fascinating
deportment
the
anxiety
of
this
lady
on
behalf
of
emily
kept
her
ever
on
the
alert
when
chance
or
any
chain
of
circumstances
threw
her
in
the
way
of
forming
new
connexions
of
any
kind
and
of
late
as
her
charge
approached
the
period
of
life
her
sex
were
apt
to
make
that
choice
from
which
there
is
no
retreat
her
solicitude
to
examine
the
characters
of
the
men
who
approached
her
was
really
painful
as
to
lady
moseley
her
wishes
disposed
her
to
be
easily
satisfied
and
her
mind
naturally
shrank
from
an
investigation
to
which
she
felt
herself
unequal
while
wilson
was
governed
by
the
convictions
of
a
sound
discretion
matured
by
long
and
deep
reasoning
all
acting
on
a
temper
at
all
times
ardent
and
a
watchfulness
calculated
to
endure
to
the
end
pray
my
lady
said
jarvis
with
a
look
of
something
like
importance
have
you
made
any
discovery
about
this
denbigh
who
died
in
the
church
lately
i
did
not
know
replied
lady
moseley
there
was
any
discovery
to
be
made
you
know
lady
moseley
said
colonel
egerton
that
in
town
all
the
little
accompaniments
of
such
a
melancholy
death
would
have
found
their
way
into
the
prints
and
i
suppose
this
is
what
jarvis
alludes
to
oh
yes
cried
jarvis
the
colonel
is
right
but
the
colonel
was
always
right
with
that
lady
lady
moseley
bowed
her
head
with
dignity
and
the
colonel
had
too
much
tact
to
pursue
the
conversation
but
the
captain
whom
nothing
had
ever
yet
abashed
exclaimed
these
denbighs
could
not
be
people
of
much
importance
i
have
never
heard
the
name
before
it
is
the
family
name
of
the
duke
of
derwent
i
believe
dryly
remarked
sir
edward
oh
i
am
sure
neither
the
old
man
nor
his
son
looked
much
like
a
duke
or
so
much
as
an
officer
either
exclaimed
jarvis
who
thought
the
latter
rank
the
dignity
in
degree
next
below
nobility
there
sat
in
the
parliament
of
this
realm
when
i
was
a
member
a
general
denbigh
said
benfield
with
his
usual
deliberation
he
was
always
on
the
same
side
with
lord
gosford
and
myself
he
and
his
friend
sir
peter
howell
who
was
the
admiral
that
took
the
french
squadron
in
the
glorious
administration
of
billy
pitt
and
afterwards
took
an
island
with
this
same
general
denbigh
aye
the
old
admiral
was
a
hearty
blade
a
good
deal
such
a
looking
man
as
my
hector
would
make
hector
was
benfield
bull
dog
mercy
whispered
john
to
clara
that
your
grandfather
that
is
to
be
uncle
benfield
is
speaking
of
clara
smiled
as
she
ventured
to
say
sir
peter
was
ives
father
sir
indeed
said
the
old
gentleman
with
a
look
of
surprise
i
never
knew
that
before
i
can
not
say
they
resemble
each
other
much
pray
uncle
does
frank
look
much
like
the
family
asked
john
with
an
air
of
unconquerable
gravity
but
sir
interrupted
emily
were
general
denbigh
and
admiral
howell
related
not
that
i
ever
knew
emmy
dear
sir
frederick
denbigh
did
not
look
much
like
the
admiral
he
rather
resembled
gathering
himself
up
into
an
air
of
formality
and
bowing
stiffly
to
colonel
egerton
this
gentleman
here
i
have
not
the
honor
of
the
connexion
observed
the
colonel
withdrawing
behind
the
chair
of
jane
wilson
changed
the
conversation
to
one
more
general
but
the
little
that
had
fallen
from
benfield
gave
reason
for
believing
a
connexion
in
some
way
of
which
they
were
ignorant
existed
between
the
descendants
of
the
two
veterans
and
which
explained
the
interest
they
felt
in
each
other
during
dinner
colonel
egerton
placed
himself
next
to
emily
and
miss
jarvis
took
the
chair
on
the
other
side
he
spoke
of
the
gay
world
of
novels
plays
and
still
finding
his
companion
reserved
and
either
unwilling
or
unable
to
talk
freely
he
tried
his
favorite
sentiment
he
had
read
poetry
and
a
remark
of
his
lighted
up
a
spark
of
intelligence
in
the
beautiful
face
of
his
companion
that
for
a
moment
deceived
him
but
as
he
went
on
to
point
out
his
favorite
beauties
it
gave
place
to
a
settled
composure
which
at
last
led
him
to
imagine
the
casket
contained
no
gem
equal
to
the
promise
of
its
brilliant
exterior
after
resting
from
one
of
his
most
labored
displays
of
feeling
and
imagery
he
accidentally
caught
the
eyes
of
jane
fastened
on
him
with
an
expression
of
no
dubious
import
and
the
soldier
changed
his
battery
in
jane
he
found
a
more
willing
auditor
poetry
was
the
food
she
lived
on
and
in
works
of
the
imagination
she
found
her
greatest
delight
an
animated
discussion
of
the
merits
of
their
favorite
authors
now
took
place
to
renew
which
the
colonel
early
left
the
for
the
society
of
the
ladies
john
who
disliked
drinking
excessively
being
happy
of
an
excuse
to
attend
him
the
younger
ladies
had
clustered
together
round
a
window
and
even
emily
in
her
heart
rejoiced
that
the
gentlemen
had
come
to
relieve
herself
and
sisters
from
the
arduous
task
of
entertaining
women
who
appeared
not
to
possess
a
single
taste
or
opinion
in
common
with
themselves
you
were
saying
miss
moseley
observed
the
colonel
in
his
most
agreeable
manner
as
he
approached
them
you
thought
campbell
the
most
musical
poet
we
have
i
hope
you
will
unite
with
me
in
excepting
moore
jane
colored
as
with
some
awkwardness
she
replied
moore
was
certainly
very
poetical
has
moore
written
much
innocently
asked
emily
not
half
as
much
as
he
ought
cried
miss
jarvis
oh
i
could
live
on
his
beautiful
lines
jane
turned
away
in
disgust
and
that
evening
while
alone
with
clara
she
took
a
volume
of
moore
songs
and
very
coolly
consigned
them
to
the
flames
her
sister
naturally
asked
an
explanation
of
so
extraordinary
a
procedure
oh
cried
jane
i
ca
abide
the
book
since
that
vulgar
miss
jarvis
speaks
of
it
with
so
much
interest
i
really
believe
aunt
wilson
is
right
in
not
suffering
emily
to
read
such
things
and
jane
who
had
often
devoured
the
treacherous
lines
with
ardor
shrank
with
fastidious
delicacy
from
the
indulgence
of
a
perverted
taste
when
it
became
exposed
coupled
with
the
vulgarity
of
unblushing
audacity
colonel
egerton
immediately
changed
the
subject
to
one
less
objectionable
and
spoke
of
a
campaign
he
had
made
in
spain
he
possessed
the
happy
faculty
of
giving
an
interest
to
all
he
advanced
whether
true
or
not
and
as
he
never
contradicted
or
even
opposed
unless
to
yield
gracefully
when
a
lady
was
his
opponent
his
conversation
insensibly
attracted
by
putting
the
sex
in
good
humor
with
themselves
such
a
man
aided
by
the
powerful
assistants
of
person
and
manners
and
no
inconsiderable
colloquial
talents
wilson
knew
to
be
extremely
dangerous
as
a
companion
to
a
youthful
female
heart
and
as
his
visit
was
to
extend
to
a
couple
of
months
she
resolved
to
reconnoitre
the
state
of
her
pupil
opinion
forthwith
in
reference
to
his
merits
she
had
taken
too
much
pains
in
forming
the
mind
of
emily
to
apprehend
she
would
fall
a
victim
to
the
eye
but
she
also
knew
that
personal
grace
sweetened
a
benevolent
expression
and
added
force
even
to
the
oracles
of
wisdom
she
labored
a
little
herself
under
the
disadvantage
of
what
john
called
a
didactic
manner
and
which
although
she
had
not
the
ability
or
rather
taste
to
amend
she
had
yet
the
sense
to
discern
it
was
the
great
error
of
wilson
to
attempt
to
convince
where
she
might
have
influenced
but
her
ardor
of
temperament
and
great
love
of
truth
kept
her
as
it
were
tilting
with
the
vices
of
mankind
and
consequently
sometimes
in
unprofitable
combat
with
her
charge
however
this
could
never
be
said
to
be
the
case
emily
knew
her
heart
felt
her
love
and
revered
her
principles
too
deeply
to
throw
away
an
admonition
or
disregard
a
precept
that
fell
from
lips
she
knew
never
spoke
idly
or
without
consideration
john
had
felt
tempted
to
push
the
conversation
with
miss
jarvis
and
he
was
about
to
utter
something
rapturous
respecting
the
melodious
poison
of
little
poems
as
the
blue
eye
of
emily
rested
on
him
in
the
fulness
of
sisterly
affection
and
checking
his
love
of
the
ridiculous
he
quietly
yielded
to
his
respect
for
the
innocence
of
his
sisters
and
as
if
eager
to
draw
the
attention
of
all
from
the
hateful
subject
he
put
question
after
question
to
egerton
concerning
the
spaniards
and
their
customs
did
you
ever
meet
lord
pendennyss
in
spain
colonel
egerton
inquired
wilson
with
interest
never
madam
he
replied
i
have
much
reason
to
regret
that
our
service
lay
in
different
parts
of
the
country
his
lordship
was
much
with
the
duke
and
i
made
the
campaign
under
marshal
beresford
emily
left
the
group
at
the
window
and
taking
a
seat
on
the
sofa
by
the
side
of
her
aunt
insensibly
led
her
to
forget
the
gloomy
thoughts
which
had
begun
to
steal
over
her
which
the
colonel
approaching
where
they
sat
continued
by
asking
are
you
acquainted
with
the
earl
madam
not
in
person
but
by
character
said
wilson
in
a
melancholy
manner
his
character
as
a
soldier
was
very
high
he
had
no
superior
of
his
years
in
spain
i
am
told
no
reply
was
made
to
this
remark
and
emily
endeavored
anxiously
to
draw
the
mind
of
her
aunt
to
reflections
of
a
more
agreeable
nature
the
colonel
whose
vigilance
to
please
was
ever
on
the
alert
kindly
aided
her
and
they
soon
succeeded
the
merchant
withdrew
with
his
family
and
guest
in
proper
season
and
wilson
heedful
of
her
duty
took
the
opportunity
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
privacy
in
her
own
in
the
evening
to
touch
gently
on
the
subject
of
the
gentlemen
they
had
seen
that
day
how
are
you
pleased
emily
with
your
new
acquaintances
familiarly
commenced
wilson
oh
aunt
do
ask
me
as
john
says
they
are
net
indeed
i
am
not
sorry
continued
the
aunt
to
have
you
observe
more
closely
than
you
have
been
used
to
the
manners
of
such
women
as
the
jarvises
they
are
too
abrupt
and
unpleasant
to
create
a
dread
of
any
imitation
but
the
gentlemen
are
heroes
in
very
different
styles
different
from
each
other
indeed
to
which
do
you
give
the
preference
my
dear
preference
aunt
said
her
niece
with
a
look
of
astonishment
preference
is
a
strong
word
for
either
but
i
rather
think
the
captain
the
most
eligible
companion
of
the
two
i
do
believe
you
see
the
worst
of
him
and
although
i
acknowledge
it
to
be
bad
enough
he
might
amend
but
the
colonel
go
on
said
wilson
why
everything
about
the
colonel
seems
so
seated
so
ingrafted
in
his
nature
so
so
very
that
i
am
afraid
it
would
be
a
difficult
task
to
take
the
first
step
in
amendment
to
convince
him
of
its
necessity
and
is
it
then
so
necessary
emily
looked
up
from
arranging
some
laces
with
an
expression
of
surprise
as
he
replied
did
you
not
hear
him
talk
of
those
poems
and
attempt
to
point
out
the
beauties
of
several
works
i
thought
everything
he
uttered
was
referred
to
taste
and
that
not
a
very
natural
one
at
least
she
added
with
a
laugh
it
differed
greatly
from
mine
he
seemed
to
forget
altogether
there
was
such
a
thing
as
principle
and
then
he
spoke
of
some
woman
to
jane
who
had
left
her
father
for
her
lover
with
so
much
admiration
of
her
feelings
to
take
up
with
poverty
and
love
as
he
called
it
in
place
of
condemning
her
want
of
filial
piety
i
am
sure
aunt
if
you
had
heard
that
you
would
not
admire
him
so
much
i
do
not
admire
him
at
all
child
i
only
want
to
know
your
sentiments
and
i
am
happy
to
find
them
so
correct
it
is
as
you
think
colonel
egerton
appears
to
refer
nothing
to
principle
even
the
more
generous
feelings
i
am
afraid
are
corrupted
in
him
from
too
low
intercourse
with
the
surface
of
society
there
is
by
far
too
much
pliability
about
him
for
principle
of
any
kind
unless
indeed
it
be
a
principle
to
please
no
matter
how
no
one
who
has
deeply
seated
opinions
of
right
and
wrong
will
ever
abandon
them
even
in
the
courtesies
of
polite
intercourse
they
may
be
silent
but
never
acquiescent
in
short
my
dear
the
dread
of
offending
our
maker
ought
to
be
so
superior
to
that
of
offending
our
fellow
creatures
that
we
should
endeavor
i
believe
to
be
even
more
unbending
to
the
follies
of
the
world
than
we
are
and
yet
the
colonel
is
what
they
call
a
good
companion
i
mean
a
pleasant
one
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words
he
is
certainly
my
dear
yet
you
soon
tire
of
sentiments
which
will
not
stand
the
test
of
examination
and
of
a
manner
you
can
not
but
see
is
artificial
he
may
do
very
well
for
a
companion
but
very
ill
for
a
friend
in
short
colonel
egerton
has
neither
been
satisfied
to
yield
to
his
natural
impressions
nor
to
obtain
new
ones
from
a
proper
source
he
has
copied
from
bad
models
and
his
work
must
necessarily
be
imperfect
kissing
her
niece
wilson
then
retired
into
her
own
room
with
the
happy
assurance
that
she
had
not
labored
in
vain
but
that
with
divine
aid
she
had
implanted
a
guide
in
the
bosom
of
her
charge
that
could
not
fail
with
ordinary
care
to
lead
her
straight
through
the
devious
path
of
female
duties
chapter
vii
a
month
now
passed
in
the
ordinary
occupations
and
amusements
of
a
country
life
during
which
both
lady
moseley
and
jane
manifested
a
desire
to
keep
up
the
deanery
acquaintance
that
surprised
emily
a
little
who
had
ever
seen
her
mother
shrink
from
communications
with
those
whose
breeding
subjected
her
own
delicacy
to
the
little
shocks
she
could
but
ill
conceal
in
jane
this
desire
was
still
more
inexplicable
for
jane
had
in
a
decided
way
very
common
to
her
avowed
her
disgust
of
the
manners
of
their
new
associates
at
the
commencement
of
the
acquaintance
and
yet
jane
would
now
even
quit
her
own
society
for
that
of
miss
jarvis
especially
if
colonel
egerton
happened
to
be
of
the
party
the
innocence
of
emily
prevented
her
scanning
the
motives
for
the
conduct
of
her
sister
and
she
set
seriously
about
an
examination
into
her
own
deportment
to
find
the
latent
cause
in
order
wherever
an
opportunity
should
offer
to
evince
her
regret
had
it
been
her
misfortune
to
have
erred
by
the
tenderness
of
her
own
manner
for
a
short
time
the
colonel
seemed
at
a
loss
where
to
make
his
choice
but
a
few
days
determined
him
and
jane
was
evidently
the
favorite
it
is
true
that
in
the
presence
of
the
jarvis
ladies
he
was
more
guarded
and
general
in
his
attentions
but
as
john
from
a
motive
of
charity
had
taken
the
direction
of
the
captain
sports
into
his
own
hands
and
as
they
were
in
the
frequent
habit
of
meeting
at
the
hall
preparatory
to
their
morning
excursion
the
colonel
suddenly
became
a
sportsman
the
ladies
would
often
accompany
them
in
their
morning
excursions
and
as
john
would
certainly
be
a
baronet
and
the
colonel
might
not
if
his
uncle
married
he
had
the
comfort
of
being
sometimes
ridden
as
well
as
of
riding
one
morning
having
all
prepared
for
an
excursion
on
horseback
as
they
stood
at
the
door
ready
to
mount
francis
ives
drove
up
in
his
gig
and
for
a
moment
arrested
the
party
francis
was
a
favorite
with
the
whole
moseley
family
and
their
greetings
were
warm
and
sincere
he
found
they
meant
to
take
the
rectory
in
their
ride
and
insisted
that
they
should
proceed
clara
would
take
a
seat
with
him
as
he
spoke
the
cast
of
his
countenance
brought
the
color
into
the
cheeks
of
his
intended
she
suffered
herself
however
to
be
handed
into
the
vacant
seat
in
the
gig
and
they
moved
on
john
who
was
at
the
bottom
natured
and
loved
both
francis
and
clara
very
sincerely
soon
set
captain
jarvis
and
his
sister
what
he
called
scrub
racing
and
necessity
in
some
measure
compelled
the
rest
of
the
equestrians
to
hard
riding
in
order
to
keep
up
with
the
sports
that
will
do
that
will
do
cried
john
casting
his
eye
back
and
perceiving
they
had
lost
sight
of
the
gig
and
nearly
so
of
colonel
egerton
and
jane
why
you
carry
it
off
like
a
jockey
captain
better
than
any
amateur
i
have
ever
seen
unless
indeed
it
be
your
sister
the
lady
encouraged
by
his
commendations
whipped
on
followed
by
her
brother
and
sister
at
half
speed
there
emily
said
john
quietly
dropping
by
her
side
i
see
no
reason
you
and
i
should
break
our
necks
to
show
the
blood
of
our
horses
now
do
you
know
i
think
we
are
going
to
have
a
wedding
in
the
family
soon
emily
looked
at
him
in
amazement
frank
has
got
a
living
i
saw
it
the
moment
he
drove
up
he
came
in
like
somebody
yes
i
dare
say
he
has
calculated
the
tithes
already
a
dozen
times
john
was
right
the
earl
of
bolton
had
unsolicited
given
him
the
desired
living
of
his
own
parish
and
francis
was
at
the
moment
pressing
the
blushing
clara
to
fix
the
day
that
was
to
put
a
period
to
his
long
probation
clara
who
had
not
a
particle
of
coquetry
about
her
promised
to
be
his
as
soon
as
he
was
inducted
an
event
that
was
to
take
place
the
following
week
and
then
followed
those
delightful
little
arrangements
and
plans
with
which
youthful
hope
is
so
fond
of
filling
up
the
void
of
life
doctor
said
john
as
he
came
out
of
the
rectory
to
assist
clara
from
the
gig
the
parson
here
is
a
careful
driver
see
he
has
not
turned
a
hair
he
kissed
the
burning
cheek
of
his
sister
as
she
touched
the
ground
and
whispered
significantly
you
need
tell
me
nothing
my
dear
i
know
all
i
consent
ives
folded
her
future
daughter
to
her
bosom
and
the
benevolent
smile
of
the
good
rector
together
with
the
kind
and
affectionate
manner
of
her
sisters
assured
clara
the
approaching
nuptials
were
anticipated
as
a
matter
of
course
colonel
egerton
offered
his
compliments
to
francis
on
his
preferment
to
the
living
with
the
polish
of
high
breeding
and
not
without
an
appearance
of
interest
and
emily
thought
him
for
the
first
time
as
handsome
as
he
was
generally
reputed
to
be
the
ladies
undertook
to
say
something
civil
in
their
turn
and
john
put
the
captain
by
a
hint
on
the
same
track
you
are
quite
lucky
sir
said
the
captain
in
getting
so
good
a
living
with
so
little
trouble
i
wish
you
joy
of
it
with
all
my
heart
moseley
tells
me
it
is
a
capital
thing
now
for
a
gentleman
of
your
profession
for
my
part
i
prefer
a
scarlet
coat
to
a
black
one
but
there
must
be
parsons
you
know
or
how
should
we
get
married
or
say
grace
francis
thanked
him
for
his
good
wishes
and
egerton
paid
a
handsome
compliment
to
the
liberality
of
the
earl
he
doubted
not
he
found
that
gratification
which
always
attends
a
disinterested
act
and
jane
applauded
the
sentiment
with
a
smile
the
baronet
when
he
was
made
acquainted
with
the
situation
of
affairs
promised
francis
that
no
unnecessary
delay
should
intervene
and
the
marriage
was
happily
arranged
for
the
following
week
lady
moseley
when
she
retired
to
the
after
dinner
commenced
a
recital
of
the
ceremony
and
company
to
be
invited
on
the
occasion
etiquette
and
the
decencies
of
life
were
not
only
the
forte
but
the
fault
of
this
lady
and
she
had
gone
on
to
the
enumeration
of
about
the
fortieth
personage
in
the
ceremonials
before
clara
found
courage
to
say
that
ives
and
myself
both
wish
to
be
married
at
the
altar
and
to
proceed
to
bolton
rectory
immediately
after
the
ceremony
to
this
her
mother
warmly
objected
and
argument
and
respectful
remonstrance
had
followed
each
other
for
some
time
before
clara
submitted
in
silence
with
difficulty
restraining
her
tears
this
appeal
to
the
better
feelings
of
the
mother
triumphed
and
the
love
of
parade
yielded
to
love
of
her
offspring
clara
with
a
lightened
heart
kissed
and
thanked
her
and
accompanied
by
emily
left
the
room
jane
had
risen
to
follow
them
but
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
tilbury
of
colonel
egerton
she
reseated
herself
he
had
merely
driven
over
at
the
earnest
entreaties
of
the
ladies
to
beg
miss
jane
would
accept
a
seat
back
with
him
they
had
some
little
project
on
foot
and
could
not
proceed
without
her
assistance
wilson
looked
gravely
at
her
sister
as
she
smiled
acquiescence
to
his
wishes
and
the
daughter
who
but
the
minute
before
had
forgotten
there
was
any
other
person
in
the
world
but
clara
flew
for
her
hat
and
shawl
in
order
as
he
said
to
herself
that
the
politeness
of
colonel
egerton
might
not
keep
him
waiting
lady
moseley
resumed
her
seat
by
the
side
of
her
sister
with
an
air
of
great
complacency
as
she
returned
from
the
window
after
having
seen
her
daughter
off
for
some
time
each
was
occupied
quietly
with
her
needle
when
wilson
suddenly
broke
the
silence
by
saying
who
is
colonel
egerton
lady
moseley
looked
up
for
a
moment
in
amazement
but
recollecting
herself
answered
the
nephew
and
heir
of
sir
edgar
egerton
sister
this
was
spoken
in
a
rather
positive
way
as
if
it
were
unanswerable
yet
as
there
was
nothing
harsh
in
the
reply
wilson
continued
do
you
not
think
him
attentive
to
jane
pleasure
sparkled
in
the
still
brilliant
eyes
of
lady
moseley
as
she
exclaimed
do
you
think
so
i
do
and
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
say
improperly
so
i
think
you
were
wrong
in
suffering
jane
to
go
with
him
this
afternoon
why
improperly
charlotte
if
colonel
egerton
is
polite
enough
to
show
jane
such
attentions
should
i
not
be
wrong
in
rudely
rejecting
them
the
rudeness
of
refusing
a
request
that
is
improper
to
grant
is
a
very
venial
offence
i
confess
i
think
it
improper
to
allow
any
attentions
to
be
forced
on
us
that
may
subject
us
to
disagreeable
consequences
but
the
attentions
of
colonel
egerton
are
becoming
marked
anne
do
you
for
a
moment
doubt
their
being
honorable
or
that
he
dares
to
trifle
with
a
daughter
of
sir
edward
moseley
i
should
hope
not
certainly
although
it
may
be
well
to
guard
even
against
such
a
misfortune
but
i
am
of
opinion
it
is
quite
as
important
to
know
whether
he
is
worthy
to
be
her
husband
as
it
is
to
know
that
he
is
in
a
situation
to
become
so
on
what
points
charlotte
would
you
wish
to
be
more
assured
you
know
his
birth
and
probable
fortune
you
see
his
manners
and
disposition
but
these
latter
are
things
for
jane
to
decide
on
she
is
to
live
with
him
and
it
is
proper
she
should
be
suited
in
these
respects
i
do
not
deny
his
fortune
or
his
disposition
but
i
complain
that
we
give
him
credit
for
the
last
and
for
still
more
important
requisites
without
evidence
of
his
possessing
any
of
them
his
principles
his
habits
his
very
character
what
do
we
know
of
them
i
say
we
for
you
know
anne
your
children
are
as
dear
to
me
as
my
own
would
have
been
i
believe
you
sincerely
but
the
things
you
mention
are
points
for
jane
to
decide
on
if
she
be
pleased
i
have
no
right
to
complain
i
am
determined
never
to
control
the
affections
of
my
children
had
you
said
never
to
force
the
affections
of
your
children
you
would
have
said
enough
anne
but
to
control
or
rather
to
guide
the
affections
of
a
child
especially
a
daughter
is
in
some
cases
a
duty
as
imperative
as
it
would
be
to
avert
any
other
impending
calamity
surely
the
proper
time
to
do
this
is
before
the
affections
of
the
child
are
likely
to
endanger
her
peace
of
mind
i
have
seldom
seen
much
good
result
from
the
interference
of
parents
said
lady
moseley
a
little
pertinaciously
true
for
to
be
of
use
unless
in
extraordinary
cases
it
should
not
be
seen
you
will
pardon
me
anne
but
i
have
often
thought
parents
are
too
often
in
extremes
determined
to
make
the
election
for
their
children
or
leaving
them
entirely
to
their
own
vanity
and
inexperience
to
govern
not
only
their
own
lives
but
i
may
say
to
leave
an
impression
on
future
generations
and
after
all
what
is
this
love
in
nineteen
cases
in
twenty
of
what
we
call
affairs
of
the
heart
it
would
be
better
to
term
them
affairs
of
the
imagination
and
is
there
not
a
great
deal
of
imagination
in
all
love
inquired
lady
moseley
smiling
undoubtedly
there
is
some
but
there
is
one
important
difference
in
affairs
of
the
imagination
the
admired
object
is
gifted
with
all
those
qualities
we
esteem
as
a
matter
of
course
and
there
is
a
certain
set
of
females
who
are
ever
ready
to
bestow
this
admiration
on
any
applicant
for
their
favors
who
may
not
be
strikingly
objectionable
the
necessity
of
being
courted
makes
our
sex
rather
too
much
disposed
to
admire
improper
suitors
but
how
do
you
distinguish
affairs
of
the
heart
charlotte
from
those
of
the
fancy
when
the
heart
takes
the
lead
it
is
not
difficult
to
detect
it
such
sentiments
generally
follow
long
intercourse
and
opportunities
of
judging
the
real
character
they
are
the
only
attachments
that
are
likely
to
stand
the
test
of
worldly
trials
suppose
emily
to
be
the
object
of
colonel
egerton
pursuit
then
sister
in
what
manner
would
you
proceed
to
destroy
the
influence
i
acknowledge
he
is
gaining
over
jane
i
can
not
suppose
such
a
case
said
wilson
gravely
and
then
observing
that
her
sister
looked
as
if
she
required
an
explanation
she
continued
my
attention
has
been
directed
to
the
forming
of
such
principles
and
such
a
taste
if
i
may
use
the
expression
under
those
principles
that
i
feel
no
apprehension
emily
will
ever
allow
her
affections
to
be
ensnared
by
a
man
of
the
opinions
and
views
of
colonel
egerton
i
am
impressed
with
a
twofold
duty
in
watching
the
feelings
of
my
charge
she
has
so
much
singleness
of
heart
such
real
strength
of
native
feeling
that
should
an
improper
man
gain
possession
of
her
affections
the
struggle
between
her
duty
and
her
love
would
be
weighty
indeed
and
should
it
proceed
so
far
as
to
make
it
her
duty
to
love
an
unworthy
object
i
am
sure
she
would
sink
under
it
emily
would
die
in
the
same
circumstances
under
which
jane
would
only
awake
from
a
dream
and
be
wretched
i
thought
you
entertained
a
better
opinion
of
jane
sister
said
lady
moseley
reproachfully
i
think
her
admirably
calculated
to
make
an
invaluable
wife
and
mother
but
she
is
so
much
under
the
influence
of
her
fancy
that
she
seldom
gives
her
heart
an
opportunity
of
displaying
its
excellences
and
again
she
dwells
so
much
upon
imaginary
perfections
that
adulation
has
become
necessary
to
her
the
man
who
flatters
her
delicately
will
be
sure
to
win
her
esteem
and
every
woman
might
love
the
being
possessed
of
the
qualities
she
will
not
fail
to
endow
him
with
i
do
not
know
that
i
rightly
understand
how
you
would
avert
all
these
sad
consequences
of
improvident
affections
said
lady
moseley
prevention
is
better
than
cure
i
would
first
implant
such
opinions
as
would
lessen
the
danger
of
intercourse
and
as
for
particular
attentions
from
improper
objects
it
should
be
my
care
to
prevent
them
by
prohibiting
or
rather
impeding
the
intimacy
which
might
give
rise
to
them
and
least
of
all
said
wilson
with
a
friendly
smile
as
she
rose
to
leave
the
room
would
i
suffer
a
fear
of
being
impolite
to
endanger
the
happiness
of
a
young
woman
intrusted
to
my
care
chapter
viii
francis
who
labored
with
the
ardor
of
a
lover
soon
completed
the
necessary
arrangements
and
alterations
in
his
new
parsonage
the
living
was
a
good
one
and
as
the
rector
was
enabled
to
make
a
very
considerable
annual
allowance
from
the
private
fortune
his
wife
had
brought
him
and
as
sir
edward
had
twenty
thousand
pounds
in
the
funds
for
each
of
his
daughters
one
portion
of
which
was
immediately
settled
on
clara
the
youthful
couple
had
not
only
a
sufficient
but
an
abundant
provision
for
their
station
in
life
and
they
entered
on
their
matrimonial
duties
with
as
good
a
prospect
of
happiness
as
the
ills
of
this
world
can
give
to
health
affection
and
competency
their
union
had
been
deferred
by
ives
until
his
son
was
established
with
a
view
to
keep
him
under
his
own
direction
during
the
critical
period
of
his
first
impressions
in
the
priesthood
and
as
no
objection
now
remained
or
rather
the
only
one
he
ever
felt
was
removed
by
the
proximity
of
bolton
to
his
own
parish
he
now
joyfully
united
the
lovers
at
the
altar
of
the
village
church
in
the
presence
of
his
wife
and
clara
immediate
relatives
on
leaving
the
church
francis
handed
his
bride
into
his
own
carriage
which
conveyed
them
to
their
new
residence
amidst
the
good
wishes
of
his
parishioners
and
the
prayers
of
their
relatives
and
friends
and
ives
retired
to
the
rectory
to
the
sober
enjoyment
of
the
felicity
of
their
only
child
while
the
baronet
and
his
lady
felt
a
gloom
that
belied
all
the
wishes
of
the
latter
for
the
establishment
of
her
daughters
jane
and
emily
acted
as
bridesmaids
to
their
sister
and
as
both
the
former
and
her
mother
had
insisted
there
should
be
two
groomsmen
as
a
counterpoise
john
was
empowered
with
a
to
make
a
provision
accordingly
at
first
he
intimated
his
intention
of
calling
on
benfield
but
he
finally
settled
down
to
the
no
small
mortification
of
the
ladies
into
writing
a
note
to
his
kinsman
lord
chatterton
whose
residence
was
then
in
london
and
who
in
reply
after
expressing
his
sincere
regret
that
an
accident
would
prevent
his
having
the
pleasure
of
attending
stated
the
intention
of
his
mother
and
two
sisters
to
pay
them
an
early
visit
of
congratulation
as
soon
as
his
own
health
would
allow
of
his
travelling
this
answer
arrived
only
the
day
preceding
that
fixed
for
the
wedding
and
at
the
very
moment
they
were
expecting
his
lordship
in
proper
person
there
cried
jane
in
triumph
i
told
you
it
was
silly
to
send
so
far
on
so
sudden
an
occasion
now
after
all
what
is
to
be
done
it
will
be
so
awkward
when
clara

to
see

a
horse
and
ca
come
john
jenny
i
am
sure
said
jane
indignation
glowing
in
her
pretty
face
that
if
captain
jarvis
is
to
be
an
attendant
clara
must
excuse
my
acting
i
do
not
choose
to
be
associated
with
captain
jarvis
john
said
his
mother
with
dignity
your
trifling
is
unseasonable
certainly
colonel
egerton
is
a
more
fitting
person
on
every
account
and
i
desire
under
present
circumstances
that
you
ask
the
colonel
your
ladyship
wishes
are
orders
to
me
said
john
gaily
kissing
his
hand
as
he
left
the
room
the
colonel
was
but
too
happy
in
having
it
in
his
power
to
be
of
service
in
any
manner
to
a
gentleman
he
respected
as
much
as
francis
ives
he
accepted
the
duty
and
was
the
only
person
present
at
the
ceremony
who
did
not
stand
within
the
bonds
of
consanguinity
to
the
parties
he
was
invited
by
the
baronet
to
dine
at
the
hall
as
a
matter
of
course
and
notwithstanding
the
repeated
injunctions
of
jarvis
and
her
daughters
to
return
immediately
with
an
account
of
the
dress
of
the
bride
and
with
other
important
items
of
a
similar
nature
the
invitation
was
accepted
on
reaching
the
hall
emily
retired
immediately
to
her
own
room
and
at
her
reappearance
when
the
dinner
bell
rang
the
paleness
of
her
cheeks
and
the
redness
of
her
eyes
afforded
sufficient
proof
that
the
translation
of
a
companion
from
her
own
to
another
family
was
an
event
however
happy
in
itself
not
unmingled
with
grief
the
day
however
passed
off
tolerably
well
for
people
who
are
expected
to
be
premeditatedly
happy
and
when
in
their
hearts
they
are
really
more
disposed
to
weep
than
to
laugh
jane
and
the
colonel
had
most
of
the
conversation
to
themselves
during
dinner
even
the
joyous
and
thoughtless
john
wearing
his
gaiety
in
a
less
graceful
manner
than
usual
he
was
actually
detected
by
his
aunt
in
looking
with
moistened
eyes
at
the
vacant
chair
a
servant
had
from
habit
placed
at
the
table
in
the
spot
where
clara
had
been
accustomed
to
sit
this
beef
is
not
done
saunders
said
the
baronet
to
his
butler
or
my
appetite
is
not
as
good
as
usual
colonel
egerton
will
you
allow
me
the
pleasure
of
a
glass
of
sherry
the
wine
was
drunk
and
the
game
succeeded
the
beef
but
still
sir
edward
could
not
eat
how
glad
clara
will
be
to
see
us
all
the
day
after
said
wilson
your
new
housekeepers
delight
in
their
first
efforts
in
entertaining
their
friends
lady
moseley
smiled
through
her
tears
and
turning
to
her
husband
said
we
will
go
early
my
dear
that
we
may
see
the
improvements
francis
has
been
making
before
we
dine
the
baronet
nodded
assent
but
his
heart
was
too
full
to
speak
and
apologizing
to
the
colonel
for
his
absence
on
the
plea
of
some
business
with
his
people
he
left
the
room
all
this
time
the
attentions
of
colonel
egerton
to
both
mother
and
daughter
were
of
the
most
delicate
kind
he
spoke
of
clara
as
if
his
office
of
groomsman
entitled
him
to
an
interest
in
her
welfare
with
john
he
was
kind
and
sociable
and
even
wilson
acknowledged
after
he
had
taken
his
leave
that
he
possessed
a
wonderful
faculty
of
making
himself
agreeable
and
she
began
to
think
that
under
all
circumstances
he
might
possibly
prove
as
advantageous
a
connexion
as
jane
could
expect
to
form
had
any
one
however
proposed
him
as
a
husband
for
emily
affection
would
have
quickened
her
judgment
in
a
way
that
would
have
urged
her
to
a
very
different
decision
soon
after
the
baronet
left
the
room
a
travelling
carriage
with
suitable
attendants
drove
to
the
door
the
sound
of
the
wheels
drew
most
of
the
company
to
a
window
a
baron
coronet
cried
jane
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
ornaments
of
the
harness
the
chattertons
echoed
her
brother
running
out
of
the
room
to
meet
them
the
mother
of
sir
edward
was
a
daughter
of
this
family
and
the
sister
of
the
grandfather
of
the
present
lord
the
connexion
had
always
been
kept
up
with
a
show
of
cordiality
between
sir
edward
and
his
cousin
although
their
manner
of
living
and
habits
were
very
different
the
baron
was
a
courtier
and
a
placeman
his
estates
which
he
could
not
alienate
produced
about
ten
thousand
a
year
but
the
income
he
could
and
did
spend
and
the
high
perquisites
of
his
situation
under
government
amounting
to
as
much
more
were
melted
away
year
after
year
without
making
the
provision
for
his
daughters
that
his
duty
and
the
observance
of
his
promise
to
his
wife
father
required
at
his
hands
he
had
been
dead
about
two
years
and
his
son
found
himself
saddled
with
the
support
of
an
unjointured
mother
and
unportioned
sisters
money
was
not
the
idol
the
young
lord
worshipped
nor
even
pleasure
he
was
affectionate
to
his
surviving
parent
and
his
first
act
was
to
settle
during
his
own
life
two
thousand
a
year
on
her
while
he
commenced
setting
aside
as
much
more
for
each
of
his
sisters
annually
this
abridged
him
greatly
in
his
own
expenditures
yet
as
they
made
but
one
family
and
the
dowager
was
really
a
managing
woman
in
more
senses
than
one
they
made
a
very
tolerable
figure
the
son
was
anxious
to
follow
the
example
of
sir
edward
moseley
and
give
up
his
town
house
for
at
least
a
time
but
his
mother
had
exclaimed
with
something
like
horror
at
the
proposal
chatterton
would
you
give
it
up
at
the
moment
it
can
be
of
the
most
use
to
us
and
she
threw
a
glance
at
her
daughters
that
would
have
discovered
her
motive
to
mrs
wilson
which
was
lost
on
her
son
he
poor
soul
thinking
she
found
it
convenient
to
support
the
interest
he
had
been
making
for
the
place
held
by
his
father
one
of
more
emolument
than
service
or
even
honor
the
contending
parties
were
so
equally
matched
that
this
situation
was
kept
as
it
were
in
abeyance
waiting
the
arrival
of
some
acquisition
of
interest
to
one
or
other
of
the
claimants
the
interest
of
the
peer
however
had
begun
to
lose
ground
at
the
period
of
which
we
speak
and
his
careful
mother
saw
new
motives
for
activity
in
providing
for
her
children
wilson
herself
could
not
be
more
vigilant
in
examining
the
candidates
for
emily
favors
than
was
the
dowager
lady
chatterton
in
behalf
of
her
daughter
it
is
true
the
task
of
the
former
lady
was
by
far
the
most
arduous
for
it
involved
a
study
of
character
and
development
of
principle
while
that
of
the
latter
would
have
ended
with
the
footing
of
a
provided
it
contained
five
figures
sir
edward
was
well
known
to
contain
that
number
and
two
of
them
were
not
ciphers
benfield
was
rich
and
john
moseley
was
a
very
agreeable
young
man
weddings
are
the
season
of
love
thought
the
prudent
dowager
and
grace
is
extremely
pretty
chatterton
who
never
refused
his
mother
anything
in
his
power
to
grant
and
who
was
particularly
dutiful
when
a
visit
to
moseley
hall
was
in
question
suffered
himself
to
be
persuaded
his
shoulder
was
well
and
they
had
left
town
the
day
before
the
wedding
thinking
to
be
in
time
for
all
the
gaieties
if
not
for
the
ceremony
itself
there
existed
but
little
similarity
between
the
persons
and
manners
of
this
young
nobleman
and
the
baronet
heir
the
beauty
of
chatterton
was
almost
feminine
his
skin
his
color
his
eyes
his
teeth
were
such
as
many
a
belle
had
sighed
after
and
his
manners
were
bashful
and
retiring
yet
an
intimacy
had
commenced
between
the
boys
at
school
which
ripened
into
friendship
between
the
young
men
at
college
and
had
been
maintained
ever
since
probably
as
much
from
the
contrarieties
of
character
as
from
any
other
cause
with
the
baron
john
was
more
sedate
than
ordinary
with
john
chatterton
found
unusual
animation
but
a
secret
charm
which
john
held
over
the
young
peer
was
his
profound
respect
and
unvarying
affection
for
his
youngest
sister
emily
this
was
common
ground
and
no
dreams
of
future
happiness
no
visions
of
dawning
wealth
crossed
the
imagination
of
chatterton
in
which
emily
was
not
the
fairy
to
give
birth
to
the
one
or
the
benevolent
dispenser
of
the
hoards
of
the
other
the
arrival
of
this
family
was
a
happy
relief
from
the
oppression
which
hung
on
the
spirits
of
the
moseleys
and
their
reception
marked
with
the
mild
benevolence
which
belonged
to
the
nature
of
the
baronet
and
that
impressement
which
so
eminently
distinguished
the
manners
of
his
wife
the
honorable
misses
chatterton
were
both
handsome
but
the
younger
was
if
possible
a
softened
picture
of
her
brother
there
was
the
same
retiring
bashfulness
and
the
same
sweetness
of
temper
as
distinguished
the
baron
and
grace
was
the
peculiar
favorite
of
emily
moseley
nothing
of
the
strained
or
sentimental
nature
which
so
often
characterize
what
is
called
female
friendships
however
had
crept
into
the
communications
between
these
young
women
emily
loved
her
sisters
too
well
to
go
out
of
her
own
family
for
a
repository
of
her
griefs
or
a
partaker
in
her
joys
had
her
life
been
chequered
with
such
passions
her
own
sisters
were
too
near
her
own
age
to
suffer
her
to
think
of
a
confidence
in
which
the
holy
ties
of
natural
affection
did
not
give
a
claim
to
a
participation
wilson
had
found
it
necessary
to
give
her
charge
very
different
views
on
many
subjects
from
those
which
jane
and
clara
had
been
suffered
to
imbibe
of
themselves
but
in
no
degree
had
she
impaired
the
obligations
of
filial
piety
or
family
concord
emily
was
if
anything
more
respectful
to
her
parents
more
affectionate
to
her
friends
than
any
of
her
connexions
for
in
her
the
warmth
of
natural
feeling
was
heightened
by
an
unvarying
sense
of
duty
in
grace
chatterton
she
found
in
many
respects
a
temper
and
taste
resembling
her
own
she
therefore
loved
her
better
than
others
who
had
equally
general
claims
on
her
partiality
and
as
such
a
friend
she
now
received
her
with
cordial
and
sincere
affection
jane
who
had
not
felt
satisfied
with
the
ordering
of
providence
for
the
disposal
of
her
sympathies
and
had
long
felt
a
restlessness
that
prompted
her
to
look
abroad
for
a
confiding
spirit
to
whom
to
communicate
her
secrets
she
had
none
that
delicacy
would
suffer
her
to
reveal
but
to
communicate
her
crude
opinions
and
reflections
she
had
early
selected
catherine
for
this
person
catherine
however
had
not
stood
the
test
of
trial
for
a
short
time
the
love
of
heraldry
kept
them
together
but
jane
finding
her
companion
gusto
limited
to
the
charms
of
the
coronet
and
supporters
chiefly
abandoned
the
attempt
in
despair
and
was
actually
on
the
for
a
new
candidate
for
the
vacant
station
as
colonel
egerton
came
into
the
neighborhood
a
really
delicate
female
mind
shrinks
from
the
exposure
of
its
love
to
the
other
sex
and
jane
began
to
be
less
anxious
to
form
a
connexion
which
would
either
violate
the
sensibility
of
her
nature
or
lead
to
treachery
to
her
friend
i
regret
extremely
lady
moseley
said
the
dowager
as
they
entered
the
that
the
accident
which
befel
chatterton
should
have
kept
us
until
it
was
too
late
for
the
ceremony
we
made
it
a
point
to
hasten
with
our
congratulations
however
as
soon
as
astley
cooper
thought
it
safe
for
him
to
travel
i
feel
indebted
for
your
kindness
replied
the
smiling
hostess
we
are
always
happy
to
have
our
friends
around
us
and
none
more
than
yourself
and
family
we
were
fortunate
in
finding
a
friend
to
supply
your
son
place
in
order
that
the
young
people
might
go
to
the
altar
in
a
proper
manner
lady
chatterton
allow
me
to
present
our
friend
colonel
egerton
adding
in
a
low
tone
and
with
a
little
emphasis
heir
to
sir
edgar
the
colonel
bowed
gracefully
and
the
dowager
dropped
a
hasty
courtesy
at
the
commencement
of
the
speech
but
lower
bend
followed
the
closing
remark
and
a
glance
of
the
eye
was
thrown
in
quest
of
her
daughters
as
if
she
instinctively
wished
to
bring
them
into
what
the
sailors
term
the
line
of
battle
chapter
ix
the
following
morning
emily
and
grace
declining
the
invitation
to
join
the
colonel
and
john
in
their
usual
rides
walked
to
the
rectory
accompanied
by
wilson
and
chatterton
the
ladies
felt
a
desire
to
witness
the
happiness
that
they
so
well
knew
reigned
in
the
rectory
for
francis
had
promised
his
father
to
drive
clara
over
in
the
course
of
the
day
emily
longed
to
see
clara
from
whom
it
appeared
that
she
had
been
already
separated
a
month
her
impatience
as
they
approached
the
house
hurried
her
ahead
of
her
companions
who
waited
the
more
sober
gait
of
wilson
she
entered
the
parlor
at
the
rectory
without
meeting
any
one
glowing
with
exercise
her
hair
falling
over
her
shoulders
released
from
the
confinement
of
the
hat
she
had
thrown
down
hastily
as
she
reached
the
door
in
the
room
there
stood
a
gentleman
in
deep
black
with
his
back
towards
the
entrance
intent
on
a
book
and
she
naturally
concluded
it
was
francis
where
is
dear
clara
frank
cried
the
beautiful
girl
faying
her
hand
affectionately
on
his
shoulder
the
gentleman
turned
suddenly
and
presented
to
her
astonished
gaze
the
well
remembered
countenance
of
the
young
man
whose
parent
death
was
not
likely
to
be
forgotten
at
b
i
thought
sir
said
emily
almost
sinking
with
confusion
that
francis
ives
your
brother
not
yet
arrived
miss
moseley
simply
replied
the
stranger
who
felt
for
her
embarrassment
but
i
will
immediately
acquaint
ives
with
your
visit
bowing
he
delicately
left
the
room
emily
who
felt
greatly
relieved
by
his
manner
immediately
confined
her
hair
in
its
proper
bounds
and
had
recovered
her
composure
by
the
time
her
aunt
and
friends
joined
her
she
had
not
time
to
mention
the
incident
and
laughed
at
her
own
precipitation
when
the
rector
wife
came
into
the
room
chatterton
and
his
sister
were
both
known
to
ives
and
both
were
favorites
she
was
pleased
to
see
them
and
after
reproaching
the
brother
with
compelling
her
son
to
ask
a
favor
of
a
comparative
stranger
she
turned
to
emily
and
smilingly
said
you
found
the
parlor
occupied
i
believe
yes
said
emily
laughing
and
blushing
i
suppose
denbigh
told
you
of
my
heedlessness
he
told
me
of
your
attention
in
calling
so
soon
to
inquire
after
clara
but
said
nothing
more
a
servant
just
then
telling
her
francis
wished
to
see
her
she
excused
herself
and
withdrew
in
the
door
she
met
denbigh
who
made
way
for
her
saying
your
son
has
arrived
and
in
an
easy
but
respectful
manner
he
took
his
place
with
the
guests
no
introduction
passing
and
none
seeming
necessary
his
misfortunes
appeared
to
have
made
him
acquainted
with
wilson
and
his
strikingly
ingenuous
manner
won
insensibly
on
the
confidence
of
those
who
heard
him
everything
was
natural
yet
everything
was
softened
by
education
and
the
little
party
in
the
rector
parlor
in
fifteen
minutes
felt
as
if
they
had
known
him
for
years
the
doctor
and
his
son
now
joined
them
clara
had
not
come
but
she
was
looking
forward
in
delightful
expectation
of
and
wished
greatly
for
emily
as
a
guest
at
the
new
abode
this
pleasure
wilson
promised
she
should
have
as
soon
as
they
had
got
over
the
hurry
of
their
visit
our
friends
she
added
turning
to
grace
will
overlook
the
nicer
punctilios
of
ceremony
where
sisterly
regard
calls
for
the
discharge
of
more
important
duties
clara
needs
the
society
of
emily
just
now
certainly
said
grace
mildly
i
hope
no
useless
ceremony
on
the
part
of
emily
would
prevent
her
manifesting
natural
attachment
to
her
should
feel
hurt
at
her
not
entertaining
a
better
opinion
of
us
than
to
suppose
so
for
a
moment
this
young
ladies
is
the
real
feeling
to
keep
alive
esteem
cried
the
doctor
gaily
go
on
and
say
and
do
nothing
of
which
either
can
disapprove
when
tried
by
the
standard
of
duty
and
you
need
never
be
afraid
of
losing
a
friend
that
is
worth
keeping
it
was
three
before
the
carriage
of
wilson
arrived
at
the
rectory
and
the
time
stole
away
insensibly
in
free
and
friendly
communications
denbigh
had
joined
modestly
and
with
the
degree
of
interest
a
stranger
might
be
supposed
to
feel
in
the
occurrences
of
a
circle
to
which
he
was
nearly
a
stranger
there
was
at
times
a
slight
display
of
awkwardness
however
about
both
him
and
ives
for
which
wilson
easily
accounted
by
recollections
of
his
recent
loss
and
the
scene
they
had
all
witnessed
in
that
very
room
this
embarrassment
escaped
the
notice
of
the
rest
of
the
party
on
the
arrival
of
the
carriage
wilson
took
her
leave
i
like
this
denbigh
greatly
said
lord
chatterton
as
they
drove
from
the
door
there
is
something
strikingly
natural
and
winning
in
his
manner
in
his
matter
too
judging
of
the
little
we
have
seen
of
him
replied
wilson
who
is
he
i
rather
suspect
he
is
someway
related
to
ives
her
staying
from
bolton
must
be
owing
to
denbigh
and
as
the
doctor
has
just
gone
he
must
be
near
enough
to
them
to
be
neither
wholly
neglected
nor
yet
a
tax
upon
their
politeness
i
rather
wonder
he
did
not
go
with
them
i
heard
him
tell
francis
remarked
emily
that
he
could
not
think
of
intruding
and
he
insisted
on
ives
going
but
she
had
employments
to
keep
her
at
home
the
carriage
soon
reached
an
angle
in
the
road
where
the
highways
between
bolton
castle
and
moseley
hall
intersected
each
other
at
a
point
on
the
estate
of
the
former
wilson
stopped
a
moment
to
inquire
after
an
aged
pensioner
who
had
lately
met
with
a
loss
in
business
which
she
was
fearful
must
have
greatly
distressed
him
in
crossing
a
ford
in
the
little
river
between
his
cottage
and
the
town
the
stream
which
had
been
swollen
unexpectedly
higher
than
usual
by
heavy
rains
had
swept
away
his
horse
and
cart
loaded
with
the
entire
produce
of
his
small
field
and
with
much
difficulty
he
had
saved
even
his
own
life
wilson
had
not
had
it
in
her
power
until
this
moment
to
inquire
particularly
into
the
affair
or
to
offer
the
relief
she
was
ever
ready
to
bestow
on
proper
objects
contrary
to
her
expectations
she
found
humphreys
in
high
spirits
showing
his
delighted
children
a
new
cart
and
horse
which
stood
at
the
door
and
exultingly
pointing
out
the
excellent
qualities
of
both
he
ceased
talking
on
the
approach
of
the
party
and
at
the
request
of
his
ancient
benefactress
he
gave
a
particular
account
of
the
affair
and
where
did
you
get
this
new
cart
and
horse
humphreys
inquired
wilson
when
he
had
ended
oh
madam
i
went
up
to
the
castle
to
see
the
steward
and
martin
just
mentioned
my
loss
to
lord
pendennyss
and
my
lord
ordered
me
this
cart
and
this
noble
horse
and
twenty
golden
guineas
into
the
bargain
to
put
me
on
my
legs
again
god
bless
him
for
it
for
ever
it
was
very
kind
of
his
lordship
indeed
said
wilson
thoughtfully
i
did
not
know
he
was
at
the
castle
he
gone
already
madam
the
servants
told
me
that
he
just
called
to
see
the
earl
on
his
way
to
but
finding
he
went
a
few
days
agone
to
ireland
my
lord
went
for
without
stopping
the
night
even
ah
madam
continued
the
old
man
who
stood
leaning
on
a
stick
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
a
great
blessing
to
the
poor
his
servants
say
he
gives
thousands
every
year
to
the
poor
who
are
in
want
he
is
main
rich
too
some
people
say
much
richer
and
more
great
like
than
the
earl
himself
i
sure
i
have
need
to
bless
him
every
day
of
my
life
wilson
smiled
mournfully
as
she
wished
humphreys
good
day
and
put
up
her
purse
finding
the
old
man
so
well
provided
for
a
display
or
competition
in
charity
never
entering
into
her
system
of
benevolence
his
lordship
is
munificent
in
his
bounty
said
emily
as
they
drove
from
the
door
does
it
not
savor
of
thoughtlessness
to
bestow
so
much
where
he
can
know
so
little
lord
chatterton
ventured
to
inquire
he
is
replied
wilson
as
old
humphrey
says
main
rich
but
the
son
of
the
old
man
and
the
father
of
these
children
is
a
soldier
in
the
th
dragoons
of
which
the
earl
is
colonel
and
that
accounts
to
me
for
his
liberality
recollecting
with
a
sigh
the
feelings
which
had
drawn
her
out
of
the
usual
circle
of
her
charities
in
the
case
of
the
same
man
did
you
ever
see
lord
pendennyss
aunt
never
my
dear
he
has
been
much
abroad
but
my
letters
were
filled
with
his
praises
and
i
confess
my
disappointment
is
great
in
not
seeing
him
on
this
visit
to
lord
bolton
who
is
his
relation
but
fixing
her
eyes
thoughtfully
on
her
niece
we
shall
meet
in
london
this
winter
i
trust
as
she
spoke
a
cloud
passed
over
her
features
and
she
continued
much
absorbed
in
thought
for
the
remainder
of
their
drive
general
wilson
had
been
a
cavalry
officer
and
he
commanded
the
very
regiment
now
held
by
lord
pendennyss
in
an
excursion
near
the
british
camp
he
had
been
rescued
from
captivity
if
not
from
death
by
a
gallant
and
timely
interference
of
this
young
nobleman
then
in
command
of
a
troop
in
the
same
corps
he
had
mentioned
the
occurrence
to
his
wife
in
his
letters
and
from
that
day
his
correspondence
was
filled
with
the
praises
of
the
bravery
and
goodness
to
the
soldiery
of
his
young
comrade
when
he
fell
he
had
been
supported
from
the
field
by
and
he
actually
died
in
the
arms
of
the
young
peer
a
letter
announcing
his
death
had
been
received
by
his
widow
from
the
earl
himself
and
the
tender
and
affectionate
manner
in
which
he
spoke
of
her
husband
had
taken
a
deep
hold
on
her
affections
all
the
circumstances
together
threw
an
interest
around
him
that
had
made
wilson
almost
entertain
the
romantic
wish
he
might
be
found
worthy
and
disposed
to
solicit
the
hand
of
emily
her
anxious
inquiries
into
his
character
had
been
attended
with
such
answers
as
flattered
her
wishes
but
the
military
duties
of
the
earl
or
his
private
affairs
had
never
allowed
a
meeting
and
she
was
now
compelled
to
look
forward
to
what
john
laughingly
termed
their
winter
campaign
as
the
only
probable
place
where
she
could
be
gratified
with
the
sight
of
a
young
man
to
whom
she
owed
so
much
and
whose
name
was
connected
with
some
of
the
most
tender
though
most
melancholy
recollections
of
her
life
colonel
egerton
who
now
appeared
to
be
almost
domesticated
in
the
family
was
again
of
the
party
at
dinner
to
the
no
small
satisfaction
of
the
dowager
who
from
proper
inquiries
in
the
course
of
the
day
had
learned
that
sir
edgar
heir
was
likely
to
have
the
necessary
number
of
figures
in
the
sum
total
of
his
rental
while
sitting
in
the
room
that
afternoon
she
made
an
attempt
to
bring
her
eldest
daughter
and
the
elegant
soldier
together
over
a
a
game
the
young
lady
had
been
required
to
learn
because
it
was
one
at
which
a
gentleman
could
be
kept
longer
than
any
other
without
having
his
attention
drawn
away
by
any
of
those
straggling
charms
which
might
be
travelling
a
seeking
whom
they
may
devour
it
was
also
a
game
admirably
suited
to
the
display
of
a
beautiful
hand
and
arm
but
the
mother
had
for
a
long
time
been
puzzled
to
discover
a
way
of
bringing
in
the
foot
also
the
young
lady
being
particularly
remarkable
for
the
beauty
of
that
portion
of
the
frame
in
vain
her
daughter
hinted
at
dancing
an
amusement
of
which
she
was
passionately
fond
the
wary
mother
knew
too
well
the
effects
of
concentrated
force
to
listen
to
the
suggestion
dancing
might
do
for
every
manager
but
she
prided
herself
in
acting
en
masse
like
napoleon
whose
tactics
consisted
in
overwhelming
by
uniting
his
forces
on
a
given
point
after
many
experiments
in
her
own
person
she
endeavored
to
improve
catharine
manner
of
sitting
and
by
dint
of
twisting
and
turning
she
contrived
that
her
pretty
foot
and
ankle
should
be
thrown
forward
in
a
way
that
the
eye
dropping
from
the
move
should
unavoidably
rest
on
this
beauteous
object
giving
as
it
were
a
scylla
and
charybdis
to
her
daughter
charms
john
moseley
was
the
first
person
on
whom
she
undertook
to
try
the
effect
of
her
invention
and
after
comfortably
seating
the
parties
she
withdrew
to
a
little
distance
to
watch
the
effect
check
to
your
king
miss
chatterton
cried
john
early
in
the
game
and
the
young
lady
thrust
out
her
foot
check
to
your
king
moseley
echoed
the
damsel
and
john
eyes
wandered
from
hand
to
foot
and
foot
to
hand
check
king
and
queen
did
you
speak
said
john
looking
up
he
caught
the
eye
of
the
dowager
fixed
on
him
in
triumph
oh
ho
said
the
young
man
internally
mother
chatterton
are
you
playing
too
and
coolly
taking
up
his
hat
he
walked
off
nor
could
they
ever
get
him
seated
at
the
game
again
you
beat
me
too
easily
miss
chatterton
he
would
say
when
pressed
to
play
before
i
have
time
to
look
up
it
excuse
me
the
dowager
next
settled
down
into
a
more
covert
attack
through
grace
but
here
she
had
two
to
contend
with
her
own
forces
rebelled
and
the
war
had
been
protracted
to
the
present
hour
with
varied
success
and
at
least
without
any
material
captures
on
one
side
colonel
egerton
entered
on
the
duties
of
his
dangerous
undertaking
with
the
indifference
of
foolhardiness
the
game
was
played
with
tolerable
ability
by
both
parties
but
no
emotions
no
absence
of
mind
could
be
discovered
on
the
part
of
the
gentleman
feet
and
hands
were
in
motion
still
the
colonel
played
as
well
as
usual
he
had
answers
for
all
questions
and
smiles
for
his
partner
but
no
could
she
obtain
until
wilfully
throwing
away
an
advantage
he
suffered
the
lady
to
win
the
game
the
dowager
was
satisfied
nothing
could
be
done
with
the
colonel
chapter
x
the
first
carriages
that
rolled
over
the
lawn
to
bolton
parsonage
on
the
succeeding
day
were
those
of
the
baronet
and
his
sister
the
latter
in
advance
there
francis
cried
emily
who
was
impatiently
waiting
for
him
to
remove
some
slight
obstruction
to
her
alighting
thank
you
thank
you
that
will
do
in
the
next
moment
she
was
in
the
extended
arms
of
clara
after
pressing
each
other
to
their
bosoms
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
emily
looked
up
with
a
tear
glistening
in
her
eye
and
first
noticed
the
form
of
denbigh
who
was
modestly
withdrawing
as
if
unwilling
to
intrude
on
such
pure
and
domestic
feelings
as
the
sisters
were
betraying
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
a
witness
wilson
and
jane
followed
by
miss
chatterton
now
entered
and
cordial
salutes
and
greetings
flowed
upon
clara
from
her
various
friends
the
baronet
coach
reached
the
door
it
contained
himself
and
wife
benfield
and
lady
chatterton
clara
stood
on
the
portico
of
the
building
ready
to
receive
them
her
face
all
smiles
and
tears
and
blushes
and
her
arm
locked
in
that
of
emily
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
new
abode
mrs
francis
lady
moseley
forgot
her
form
and
bursting
into
tears
she
pressed
her
daughter
with
ardor
to
her
bosom
clara
my
love
said
the
baronet
hastily
wiping
his
eyes
and
succeeding
his
wife
in
the
embrace
of
their
child
he
kissed
her
and
pressing
francis
by
the
hand
walked
into
the
house
in
silence
well
well
cried
the
dowager
as
she
saluted
her
cousin
all
looks
comfortable
and
genteel
here
upon
my
word
ives
grapery
houses
everything
in
good
style
too
and
sir
edward
tells
me
the
living
is
worth
a
good
five
hundred
a
year
so
girl
i
suppose
you
expect
a
kiss
said
benfield
who
ascended
the
steps
slowly
and
with
difficulty
kissing
has
gone
much
out
of
fashion
lately
i
remember
on
the
marriage
of
my
friend
lord
gosford
in
the
year
that
all
the
maids
and
attendants
were
properly
saluted
in
order
the
lady
juliana
was
quite
young
then
not
more
than
fifteen
it
was
there
i
got
my
first
salute
from
her
but
so
kiss
me
after
which
he
continued
as
they
went
into
the
house
marrying
in
that
day
was
a
serious
business
you
might
visit
a
lady
a
dozen
times
before
you
could
get
a
sight
of
her
naked
hand
who
that
stopping
short
and
looking
earnestly
at
denbigh
who
now
approached
them
denbigh
sir
said
clara
my
uncle
mr
benfield
did
you
ever
know
sir
a
gentleman
of
your
name
who
sat
in
the
parliament
of
this
realm
in
the
year
sixty
benfield
abruptly
asked
as
soon
as
the
civilities
of
the
introduction
were
exchanged
you
do
look
much
like
him
that
was
rather
before
my
day
sir
said
denbigh
with
a
smile
respectfully
offering
to
relieve
clara
who
supported
him
on
one
side
while
emily
held
his
arm
on
the
other
the
old
gentleman
was
particularly
averse
to
strangers
and
emily
was
in
terror
lest
he
should
say
something
rude
but
after
examining
denbigh
again
from
head
to
foot
he
took
the
offered
arm
and
coolly
replied
true
very
true
that
was
sixty
years
ago
you
can
hardly
recollect
as
long
ah
denbigh
times
are
sadly
altered
since
my
youth
people
who
were
then
glad
to
ride
on
a
pillion
now
drive
their
coaches
men
who
thought
ale
a
luxury
drink
their
port
aye
and
those
who
went
barefoot
must
have
their
shoes
and
stockings
too
luxury
sir
and
the
love
of
ease
will
ruin
this
mighty
empire
corruption
has
taken
hold
of
everything
the
ministry
buy
the
members
the
members
buy
the
ministry
everything
is
bought
and
sold
now
sir
in
the
parliament
in
which
i
had
the
honor
of
a
seat
there
was
a
knot
of
us
as
upright
as
posts
sir
my
lord
gosford
was
one
and
general
denbigh
was
another
although
i
ca
say
he
was
much
a
favorite
with
me
you
do
not
look
in
the
least
like
him
how
was
he
related
to
you
sir
he
was
my
grandfather
replied
denbigh
looking
pleasantly
at
emily
as
if
to
tell
her
he
understood
the
character
of
her
uncle
had
the
old
man
continued
his
speech
an
hour
longer
denbigh
would
not
have
complained
they
had
stopped
while
talking
and
he
thus
became
confronted
with
the
beautiful
figure
that
supported
the
other
arm
denbigh
contemplated
in
admiration
the
varying
countenance
which
now
blushed
with
apprehension
and
now
smiled
in
affection
or
even
with
an
archer
expression
as
her
uncle
proceeded
in
his
harangue
on
the
times
but
all
felicity
in
this
world
has
an
end
as
well
as
misery
denbigh
retained
the
recollection
of
that
speech
long
after
benfield
was
comfortably
seated
in
the
parlor
though
for
his
life
he
could
not
recollect
a
word
he
had
said
the
haughtons
the
jarvises
and
a
few
more
of
their
intimate
acquaintances
arrived
and
the
parsonage
had
a
busy
air
but
john
who
had
undertaken
to
drive
grace
chatterton
in
his
own
phaeton
was
yet
absent
some
little
anxiety
had
begun
to
be
manifested
when
he
appeared
dashing
through
the
gates
at
a
great
rate
and
with
the
skill
of
a
member
of
the
lady
chatterton
had
begun
to
be
seriously
uneasy
and
she
was
about
to
speak
to
her
son
to
go
in
quest
of
them
as
they
came
in
sight
but
now
her
fears
vanished
and
she
could
only
suppose
that
a
desire
to
have
grace
alone
could
keep
one
who
had
the
reputation
of
a
jehu
so
much
behind
the
rest
of
the
party
she
met
them
in
great
spirits
crying
upon
my
word
moseley
i
began
to
think
you
had
taken
the
road
to
scotland
you
stayed
so
long
your
daughter
my
lady
chatterton
said
john
pithily
would
go
to
scotland
neither
with
me
nor
any
other
man
or
i
am
greatly
deceived
in
her
character
clara
my
sister
how
do
you
do
he
saluted
the
bride
with
great
warmth
and
affection
but
what
detained
you
moseley
inquired
the
mother
one
of
the
horses
was
restive
and
he
broke
the
harness
we
merely
stopped
in
the
village
while
it
was
mended
and
how
did
grace
behave
asked
emily
laughing
oh
a
thousand
times
better
than
you
would
sister
as
she
always
does
and
like
an
angel
the
only
point
in
dispute
between
emily
and
her
brother
was
her
want
of
faith
in
his
driving
while
poor
grace
naturally
timid
and
unwilling
to
oppose
any
one
particularly
the
gentleman
who
then
held
the
reins
had
governed
herself
sufficiently
to
be
silent
and
motionless
indeed
she
could
hardly
do
otherwise
had
she
wished
it
so
great
was
his
impetuosity
of
character
and
john
felt
flattered
to
a
degree
of
which
he
was
himself
unconscious
aided
by
the
merit
the
beauty
and
the
delicacy
of
the
young
lady
herself
might
have
led
to
the
very
results
her
mother
so
anxiously
wished
to
produce
had
that
mother
been
satisfied
with
letting
things
take
their
course
but
managers
very
generally
overdo
their
work
grace
is
a
good
girl
said
her
gratified
mother
and
you
found
her
very
valiant
mr
moseley
oh
as
brave
as
cæsar
answered
john
carelessly
in
a
way
that
was
not
quite
free
from
irony
grace
whose
burning
cheek
showed
but
too
plainly
that
praise
from
john
moseley
was
an
incense
too
powerful
for
her
resistance
now
sank
back
behind
some
of
the
company
endeavoring
to
conceal
the
tears
that
almost
gushed
from
her
eyes
denbigh
was
a
silent
spectator
of
the
whole
scene
and
he
now
considerately
observed
that
he
had
lately
seen
an
improvement
which
would
obviate
the
difficulty
moseley
had
experienced
john
turned
to
the
speaker
and
they
were
soon
engaged
in
the
discussion
of
curbs
and
buckles
when
the
tilbury
of
colonel
egerton
drove
to
the
door
containing
himself
and
his
friend
the
captain
the
bride
undoubtedly
received
congratulations
that
day
more
sincere
than
those
which
were
now
offered
but
none
were
delivered
in
a
more
graceful
and
insinuating
manner
than
the
compliments
which
fell
from
colonel
egerton
he
passed
round
the
room
speaking
to
his
acquaintances
until
he
arrived
at
the
chair
of
jane
who
was
seated
next
her
aunt
here
he
stopped
and
glancing
his
eye
round
and
saluting
with
bows
and
smiles
the
remainder
of
the
party
he
appeared
fixed
at
the
centre
of
all
attraction
there
is
a
gentleman
i
think
i
have
never
seen
before
he
observed
to
wilson
casting
his
eyes
on
denbigh
whose
back
was
towards
him
in
discourse
with
benfield
it
is
denbigh
of
whom
you
heard
us
speak
replied
wilson
while
she
spoke
denbigh
faced
them
egerton
started
as
he
caught
a
view
of
his
face
and
seemed
to
gaze
on
the
countenance
which
was
open
to
his
inspection
with
an
earnestness
that
showed
an
interest
of
some
kind
but
of
a
nature
that
was
inexplicable
to
wilson
who
was
the
only
observer
of
this
singular
recognition
for
such
it
evidently
was
all
was
now
natural
in
the
colonel
for
the
moment
his
color
sensibly
changed
and
there
was
an
expression
of
doubt
in
his
face
it
might
be
fear
it
might
be
horror
it
might
be
a
strong
aversion
it
clearly
was
not
love
emily
sat
by
her
aunt
and
denbigh
approached
them
making
a
cheerful
remark
it
was
impossible
for
the
colonel
to
avoid
him
had
he
wished
it
and
he
kept
his
ground
wilson
thought
she
would
try
the
experiment
of
an
introduction
colonel
egerton
mr
denbigh
both
gentlemen
bowed
but
nothing
striking
was
seen
in
the
deportment
of
either
the
colonel
who
was
not
exactly
at
ease
said
hastily
denbigh
is
or
has
been
in
the
army
i
believe
denbigh
was
now
taken
by
surprise
in
his
turn
he
cast
a
look
on
egerton
of
fixed
and
settled
meaning
then
carelessly
observed
but
still
as
if
requiring
an
answer
i
am
yet
but
i
do
not
recollect
having
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
with
colonel
egerton
on
service
your
countenance
is
familiar
sir
replied
the
colonel
coldly
but
at
this
moment
i
can
not
tax
my
memory
with
the
place
of
our
meeting
though
one
sees
so
many
strange
faces
in
a
campaign
that
they
come
and
go
like
shadows
he
then
changed
the
conversation
it
was
some
time
however
before
either
gentleman
entirely
recovered
his
ease
and
many
days
elapsed
ere
anything
like
intercourse
passed
between
them
the
colonel
attached
himself
during
this
visit
to
jane
with
occasional
notices
of
the
misses
jarvis
who
began
to
manifest
symptoms
of
uneasiness
at
the
decided
preference
he
showed
to
a
lady
they
now
chose
to
look
upon
in
some
measure
as
a
rival
wilson
and
her
charge
on
the
other
hand
were
entertained
by
the
conversation
of
chatterton
and
denbigh
relieved
by
occasional
sallies
from
the
lively
john
there
was
something
in
the
person
and
manners
of
denbigh
that
insensibly
attracted
those
whom
chance
threw
in
his
way
his
face
was
not
strikingly
handsome
but
it
was
noble
and
when
he
smiled
or
was
much
animated
it
invariably
communicated
a
spark
of
his
own
enthusiasm
to
the
beholder
his
figure
was
faultless
his
air
and
manner
if
less
easy
than
those
of
colonel
egerton
were
more
sincere
and
ingenuous
his
breeding
was
clearly
higher
his
respect
for
others
rather
bordering
on
the
old
school
but
in
his
voice
there
existed
a
charm
which
would
make
him
when
he
spoke
to
a
female
ear
almost
resistless
it
was
soft
deep
melodious
and
winning
baronet
said
the
rector
looking
with
a
smile
towards
his
son
and
daughter
i
love
to
see
my
children
happy
and
ives
threatens
a
divorce
if
i
go
on
in
the
manner
i
have
commenced
she
says
i
desert
her
for
bolton
why
doctor
if
our
wives
conspire
against
us
and
prevent
our
enjoying
a
comfortable
dish
of
tea
with
clara
or
a
glass
of
wine
with
frank
we
must
call
in
the
higher
authorities
as
umpires
what
say
you
sister
is
a
parent
to
desert
his
child
in
any
case
my
opinion
is
said
wilson
with
a
smile
yet
speaking
with
emphasis
that
a
parent
is
not
to
desert
a
child
in
any
case
or
in
any
manner
do
you
hear
that
my
lady
moseley
cried
the
baronet
do
you
hear
that
my
lady
chatterton
echoed
john
who
had
just
taken
a
seat
by
grace
when
her
mother
approached
them
i
hear
it
but
do
not
see
the
application
mr
moseley
no
my
lady
why
there
is
the
honorable
miss
chatterton
almost
dying
to
play
a
game
of
her
favorite
chess
with
denbigh
she
has
beaten
us
all
but
him
and
her
triumph
will
not
be
complete
until
she
has
him
too
at
her
feet
and
as
denbigh
politely
offered
to
meet
the
challenge
the
board
was
produced
and
the
parties
were
seated
lady
chatterton
stood
leaning
over
her
daughter
chair
with
a
view
however
to
prevent
any
of
those
consequences
she
was
generally
fond
of
seeing
result
from
this
amusement
every
measure
taken
by
this
prudent
mother
being
literally
governed
by
judicious
calculation
umph
thought
john
as
he
viewed
the
players
while
listening
with
pleasure
to
the
opinions
of
grace
who
had
recovered
her
composure
and
spirits
kate
after
all
has
played
one
game
without
using
her
feet
chapter
xi
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
flew
swiftly
by
during
which
wilson
suffered
emily
to
give
clara
a
week
having
first
ascertained
that
denbigh
was
a
settled
resident
at
the
rectory
and
thereby
not
likely
to
be
oftener
at
the
house
of
francis
than
at
the
hall
where
he
was
a
frequent
and
welcome
guest
both
on
his
own
account
and
as
a
friend
of
doctor
ives
emily
had
returned
and
she
brought
the
bride
and
groom
with
her
when
one
evening
as
they
were
pleasantly
seated
at
their
various
amusements
with
the
ease
of
old
acquaintances
haughton
entered
it
was
at
an
hour
rather
unusual
for
his
visits
and
throwing
down
his
hat
after
making
the
usual
inquiries
he
began
without
preface
i
know
good
people
you
are
all
wondering
what
has
brought
me
out
this
time
of
night
but
the
truth
is
lucy
has
coaxed
her
mother
to
persuade
me
into
a
ball
in
honor
of
the
times
so
my
lady
i
have
consented
and
my
wife
and
daughter
have
been
buying
up
all
the
finery
in
b
by
the
way
i
suppose
of
anticipating
their
friends
there
is
a
regiment
of
foot
come
into
barracks
within
fifteen
miles
of
us
and
i
must
beat
up
for
recruits
among
the
officers
girls
are
never
wanting
on
such
occasions
why
cried
the
baronet
you
are
growing
young
again
my
friend
no
sir
edward
but
my
daughter
is
young
and
life
has
so
many
cares
that
i
am
willing
she
should
get
rid
of
as
many
as
she
can
at
my
expense
surely
you
would
not
wish
her
to
dance
them
away
said
wilson
such
relief
i
am
afraid
will
prove
temporary
do
you
disapprove
of
dancing
said
haughton
who
held
her
opinions
in
great
respect
as
well
as
a
little
dread
i
neither
approve
nor
disapprove
of
it
jumping
up
and
down
is
innocent
enough
in
itself
and
if
it
must
be
done
it
is
well
it
were
done
gracefully
as
for
the
accompaniments
of
dancing
i
say
nothing
what
do
you
say
doctor
ives
to
what
my
dear
madam
to
dancing
oh
let
the
girls
dance
if
they
enjoy
it
i
am
glad
you
think
so
doctor
cried
the
delighted
haughton
i
was
afraid
i
recollected
your
advising
your
son
never
to
dance
nor
to
play
at
games
of
chance
you
thought
right
my
friend
said
the
doctor
laying
down
his
newspaper
i
did
give
that
advice
to
frank
whom
you
will
please
to
remember
is
now
rector
of
bolton
i
do
not
object
to
dancing
as
not
innocent
in
itself
or
as
an
elegant
exercise
but
it
is
like
drinking
generally
carried
to
excess
now
as
a
christian
i
am
opposed
to
all
excesses
the
music
and
company
lead
to
intemperance
in
the
recreation
and
they
often
induce
neglect
of
duties
but
so
may
anything
else
i
like
a
game
of
whist
doctor
greatly
said
haughton
but
observing
that
you
never
play
and
recollecting
your
advice
to
francis
i
have
forbidden
cards
when
you
are
my
guest
i
thank
you
for
the
compliment
good
sir
replied
the
doctor
with
a
smile
still
i
would
much
rather
see
you
play
cards
than
hear
you
talk
scandal
as
you
sometimes
do
scandal
echoed
haughton
ay
scandal
said
the
doctor
coolly
such
as
the
remark
you
made
the
last
time
which
was
only
yesterday
i
called
to
see
you
you
accused
sir
edward
of
being
wrong
in
letting
that
poacher
off
so
easily
the
baronet
you
said
did
not
shoot
himself
and
did
not
know
how
to
prize
game
as
he
ought
scandal
doctor
do
you
call
that
scandal
why
i
told
sir
edward
so
himself
two
or
three
times
i
know
you
did
and
that
was
rude
rude
i
hope
sincerely
sir
edward
has
put
no
such
construction
on
it
the
baronet
smiled
kindly
and
shook
his
head
because
the
baronet
chooses
to
forgive
your
offences
it
does
not
alter
their
nature
said
the
doctor
gravely
no
you
must
repent
and
amend
you
impeached
his
motives
for
doing
a
benevolent
act
and
that
i
call
scandal
why
doctor
i
was
angry
the
fellow
should
be
let
loose
he
is
a
pest
to
all
the
game
in
the
county
and
every
sportsman
will
tell
you
so
here
moseley
you
know
jackson
the
poacher
oh
a
poacher
is
an
intolerable
wretch
cried
captain
jarvis
oh
a
poacher
echoed
john
looking
drolly
at
emily
hang
all
poachers
poacher
or
no
poacher
does
not
alter
the
scandal
said
the
doctor
now
let
me
tell
you
good
sir
i
would
rather
play
at
fifty
games
of
whist
than
make
one
such
speech
unless
indeed
it
interfered
with
my
duties
now
sir
with
your
leave
i
explain
myself
as
to
my
son
there
is
an
artificial
levity
about
dancing
that
adds
to
the
dignity
of
no
man
from
some
it
may
detract
a
clergyman
for
instance
is
supposed
to
have
other
things
to
do
and
it
might
hurt
him
in
the
opinions
of
those
with
whom
his
influence
is
necessary
and
impair
his
usefulness
therefore
a
clergyman
should
never
dance
in
the
same
way
with
cards
they
are
the
common
instruments
of
gambling
and
an
odium
is
attached
to
them
on
that
account
women
and
clergymen
must
respect
the
prejudices
of
mankind
in
some
cases
or
lose
their
influence
in
society
i
did
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
company
doctor
said
haughton
hesitatingly
and
if
it
will
give
you
pleasure
cried
the
rector
you
shall
have
it
with
all
my
heart
good
sir
it
would
be
a
greater
evil
to
wound
the
feelings
of
such
a
neighbor
as
haughton
than
to
show
my
face
once
at
a
ball
and
rising
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
other
kindly
both
your
scandal
and
rudeness
are
easily
forgiven
but
i
wished
to
show
you
the
common
error
of
the
world
which
has
attached
odium
to
certain
things
while
it
charitably
overlooks
others
of
a
more
heinous
nature
haughton
who
had
at
first
been
a
little
staggered
with
the
attack
of
the
doctor
recovered
himself
and
laying
a
handful
of
notes
on
the
table
hoped
he
should
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
every
body
the
invitation
was
generally
accepted
and
the
worthy
man
departed
happy
if
his
friends
did
but
come
and
were
pleased
do
you
dance
miss
moseley
inquired
denbigh
of
emily
as
he
sat
watching
her
graceful
movements
in
netting
a
purse
for
her
father
oh
yes
the
doctor
said
nothing
of
us
girls
you
know
i
suppose
he
thinks
we
have
no
dignity
to
lose
admonitions
are
generally
thrown
away
on
young
ladies
when
pleasure
is
in
the
question
said
the
doctor
with
a
look
of
almost
paternal
affection
i
hope
you
do
not
seriously
disapprove
of
it
in
moderation
said
wilson
that
depends
madam
upon
circumstances
if
it
is
to
be
made
subsidiary
to
envy
malice
coquetry
vanity
or
any
other
such
little
accomplishment
it
certainly
had
better
be
let
alone
but
in
moderation
and
with
the
feelings
of
my
little
pet
here
i
should
be
cynical
indeed
to
object
denbigh
appeared
lost
in
his
own
ruminations
during
this
dialogue
and
as
the
doctor
ended
he
turned
to
the
captain
who
was
overlooking
a
game
of
chess
between
the
colonel
and
jane
of
which
the
latter
had
become
remarkably
fond
of
late
playing
with
her
hands
and
eyes
instead
of
her
feet
and
inquired
the
name
of
the
corps
in
barracks
at
f
the
th
foot
sir
replied
the
captain
haughtily
who
neither
respected
him
owing
to
his
want
of
consequence
nor
loved
him
from
the
manner
in
which
emily
listened
to
his
conversation
will
miss
moseley
forgive
a
bold
request
said
denbigh
with
some
hesitation
emily
looked
up
from
her
work
in
silence
but
with
some
little
flutterings
at
the
heart
the
honor
of
her
hand
for
the
first
dance
continued
denbigh
observing
she
was
in
expectation
that
he
would
proceed
emily
laughingly
said
certainly
denbigh
if
you
can
submit
to
the
degradation
the
london
papers
now
came
in
and
most
of
the
gentlemen
sat
down
to
their
perusal
the
colonel
however
replaced
the
men
for
a
second
game
and
denbigh
still
kept
his
place
beside
wilson
and
her
niece
the
manners
the
sentiments
the
whole
exterior
of
this
gentleman
were
such
as
both
the
taste
and
judgment
of
the
aunt
approved
of
his
qualities
were
those
which
insensibly
gained
on
the
heart
and
yet
wilson
noticed
with
a
slight
uneasiness
the
very
evident
satisfaction
her
niece
took
in
his
society
in
ives
she
had
great
confidence
yet
ives
was
a
friend
and
probably
judged
him
favorably
and
again
ives
was
not
to
suppose
he
was
introducing
a
candidate
for
the
hand
of
emily
in
every
gentleman
he
brought
to
the
hall
wilson
had
seen
too
often
the
ill
consequences
of
trusting
to
impressions
received
from
inferences
of
companionship
not
to
know
the
only
safe
way
was
to
judge
for
ourselves
the
opinions
of
others
might
be
partial
might
be
prejudiced
and
many
an
improper
connexion
had
been
formed
by
listening
to
the
sentiments
of
those
who
spoke
without
interest
and
consequently
without
examination
not
a
few
matches
are
made
by
this
idle
commendation
of
others
uttered
by
those
who
are
respected
and
which
are
probably
suggested
more
by
a
desire
to
please
than
by
reflection
or
even
knowledge
in
short
wilson
knew
that
as
our
happiness
chiefly
interests
ourselves
so
it
was
to
ourselves
or
to
those
few
whose
interest
was
equal
to
our
own
we
could
only
trust
those
important
inquiries
necessary
to
establish
a
permanent
opinion
of
character
with
doctor
ives
her
communications
on
subjects
of
duty
were
frequent
and
confiding
and
although
she
sometimes
thought
his
benevolence
disposed
him
to
be
rather
too
lenient
to
the
faults
of
mankind
she
entertained
a
profound
respect
for
his
judgment
it
had
great
influence
with
her
if
it
were
not
always
conclusive
she
determined
therefore
to
have
an
early
conversation
with
him
on
the
subject
so
near
her
heart
and
be
in
a
great
measure
regulated
by
his
answers
in
the
steps
to
be
immediately
taken
every
day
gave
her
what
he
thought
melancholy
proof
of
the
ill
consequences
of
neglecting
a
duty
in
the
increasing
intimacy
of
colonel
egerton
and
jane
here
aunt
cried
john
as
he
ran
over
a
paper
is
a
paragraph
relating
to
your
favorite
youth
our
trusty
and
well
beloved
cousin
the
earl
of
pendennyss
read
it
said
wilson
with
an
interest
his
name
never
failed
to
excite
we
noticed
the
equipage
of
the
gallant
lord
pendennyss
before
the
gates
of
and
understand
the
noble
earl
is
last
from
bolton
castle
northamptonshire
a
very
important
fact
said
captain
jarvis
sarcastically
colonel
egerton
and
myself
got
as
far
as
the
village
to
pay
our
respects
to
him
when
we
heard
he
had
gone
on
to
town
the
earl
character
both
as
a
man
and
a
soldier
observed
the
colonel
gives
him
a
claim
to
our
attentions
that
his
rank
would
not
on
that
account
we
would
have
called
brother
said
wilson
you
would
oblige
me
greatly
by
asking
his
lordship
to
waive
ceremony
his
visits
to
bolton
castle
will
probably
be
frequent
now
we
have
peace
and
the
owner
is
so
much
from
home
that
we
may
never
see
him
without
some
such
invitation
do
you
want
him
as
a
husband
for
emily
cried
john
as
he
gaily
seated
himself
by
the
side
of
his
sister
wilson
smiled
at
an
observation
which
reminded
her
of
one
of
her
romantic
wishes
and
as
she
raised
her
head
to
reply
in
the
same
tone
met
the
eye
of
denbigh
fixed
on
her
with
an
expression
that
kept
her
silent
this
is
really
an
incomprehensible
young
man
in
some
respects
thought
the
cautious
widow
his
startling
looks
on
the
introduction
to
the
colonel
crossing
her
mind
at
the
same
time
and
observing
the
doctor
opening
the
door
that
led
to
the
baronet
library
wilson
who
generally
acted
as
soon
as
she
had
decided
followed
him
as
their
conversations
were
known
often
to
relate
to
the
little
offices
of
charity
in
which
they
both
delighted
the
movement
excited
no
surprise
and
she
entered
the
library
with
the
doctor
uninterrupted
doctor
said
wilson
impatient
to
proceed
to
the
point
you
know
my
maxim
prevention
is
better
than
cure
this
young
friend
of
yours
is
very
interesting
do
you
feel
yourself
in
danger
said
the
rector
smiling
not
very
imminent
replied
the
lady
laughing
seating
herself
she
continued
who
is
he
and
who
was
his
father
if
i
may
ask
george
denbigh
madam
both
father
and
son
said
the
doctor
gravely
ah
doctor
i
am
almost
tempted
to
wish
frank
had
been
a
girl
you
know
what
i
wish
to
learn
put
your
questions
in
order
dear
madam
said
the
doctor
in
a
kind
manner
and
they
shall
be
answered
his
principles
so
far
as
i
can
learn
they
are
good
his
acts
as
they
have
come
to
my
notice
are
highly
meritorious
and
i
hope
they
originated
in
proper
motives
i
have
seen
but
little
of
him
of
late
years
however
and
on
this
head
you
are
nearly
as
good
a
judge
as
myself
his
filial
piety
said
the
doctor
dashing
a
tear
from
his
eye
and
speaking
with
fervor
was
lovely
his
temper
his
disposition
his
temper
is
under
great
command
although
naturally
ardent
his
disposition
eminently
benevolent
towards
his
his
connexions
suitable
said
the
doctor
gravely
his
fortune
was
of
but
little
moment
emily
would
be
amply
provided
for
all
the
customary
necessaries
of
her
station
and
thanking
the
divine
wilson
returned
to
the
parlor
easy
in
mind
and
determined
to
let
things
take
their
own
course
for
a
time
but
in
no
degree
to
relax
the
vigilance
of
her
observation
on
her
return
to
the
room
wilson
observed
denbigh
approach
egerton
and
enter
into
conversation
of
a
general
nature
it
was
the
first
time
anything
more
than
unavoidable
courtesies
had
passed
between
them
the
colonel
appeared
slightly
uneasy
under
his
novel
situation
while
on
the
other
hand
his
companion
showed
an
anxiety
to
be
on
a
more
friendly
footing
than
heretofore
there
was
something
mysterious
in
the
feelings
manifested
by
both
these
gentlemen
that
greatly
puzzled
the
good
lady
and
from
its
complexion
she
feared
one
or
the
other
was
not
entirely
free
from
censure
it
could
not
have
been
a
quarrel
or
their
names
would
have
been
familiar
to
each
other
they
had
both
served
in
spain
she
knew
and
excesses
were
often
committed
by
gentlemen
at
a
distance
from
home
their
pride
would
have
prevented
where
they
were
anxious
to
maintain
a
character
gambling
and
a
few
other
prominent
vices
floated
through
her
imagination
until
wearied
of
conjectures
where
she
had
no
data
and
supposing
after
all
it
might
be
only
her
imagination
the
turned
to
more
pleasant
reflections
chapter
xii
the
bright
eyes
of
emily
moseley
unconsciously
wandered
round
the
brilliant
assemblage
at
haughton
as
she
took
her
seat
in
search
of
her
partner
the
rooms
were
filled
with
scarlet
coats
and
belles
from
the
little
town
of
f
and
if
the
company
were
not
the
most
select
imaginable
it
was
disposed
to
enjoy
the
passing
moment
cheerfully
and
in
lightness
of
heart
ere
however
she
could
make
out
to
scan
the
countenances
of
the
men
young
jarvis
decked
in
the
full
robes
of
his
dignity
as
captain
in
the
th
foot
approached
and
solicited
the
honor
of
her
hand
the
colonel
had
already
secured
her
sister
and
it
was
by
the
instigation
of
his
friend
jarvis
had
been
thus
early
in
his
application
emily
thanked
him
and
pleaded
her
engagement
the
mortified
youth
who
had
thought
dancing
with
the
ladies
a
favor
conferred
on
them
from
the
anxiety
his
sister
always
manifested
to
get
partners
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
sullen
silence
and
then
as
if
to
be
revenged
on
the
sex
he
determined
not
to
dance
the
whole
evening
accordingly
he
withdrew
to
a
room
appropriated
to
the
gentlemen
where
he
found
a
few
of
the
military
beaux
keeping
alive
the
stimulus
they
had
brought
with
them
from
the
clara
had
prudently
decided
to
comport
herself
as
became
a
wife
and
she
declined
dancing
altogether
catherine
chatterton
was
entitled
to
open
the
ball
as
superior
in
years
and
rank
to
any
who
were
disposed
to
enjoy
the
amusement
the
dowager
who
in
her
heart
loved
to
show
her
airs
upon
such
occasions
had
chosen
to
be
later
than
the
rest
of
the
family
and
lucy
had
to
entreat
her
father
to
have
patience
more
than
once
during
the
interregnum
in
their
sports
created
by
lady
chatterton
fashion
this
lady
at
length
appeared
attended
by
her
son
and
followed
by
her
daughters
ornamented
in
all
the
taste
of
the
reigning
fashions
doctor
ives
and
his
wife
who
came
late
from
choice
soon
appeared
accompanied
by
their
guest
and
the
dancing
commenced
denbigh
had
thrown
aside
his
black
for
the
evening
and
as
he
approached
to
claim
her
promised
hand
emily
thought
him
if
not
as
handsome
much
more
interesting
than
colonel
egerton
who
just
then
passed
them
while
leading
her
sister
to
the
set
emily
danced
beautifully
but
perfectly
like
a
lady
as
did
jane
but
denbigh
although
graceful
in
his
movements
and
in
time
knew
but
little
of
the
art
and
but
for
the
assistance
of
his
partner
he
would
have
more
than
once
gone
wrong
in
the
figure
he
very
gravely
asked
her
opinion
of
his
performance
as
he
handed
her
to
a
chair
and
she
laughingly
told
him
his
movements
were
but
a
better
sort
of
march
he
was
about
to
reply
when
jarvis
approached
by
the
aid
of
a
pint
of
wine
and
his
own
reflections
the
youth
wrought
himself
into
something
of
a
passion
especially
as
he
saw
denbigh
enter
after
emily
had
declined
dancing
with
himself
there
was
a
gentleman
in
the
corps
who
unfortunately
was
addicted
to
the
bottle
and
he
had
fastened
on
jarvis
as
a
man
at
leisure
to
keep
him
company
wine
openeth
the
heart
and
the
captain
having
taken
a
peep
at
the
dancers
and
seen
the
disposition
of
affairs
returned
to
his
bottle
companion
bursting
with
the
indignity
offered
to
his
person
he
dropped
a
hint
and
a
question
or
two
brought
the
whole
grievance
forth
there
is
a
certain
set
of
men
in
every
service
who
imbibe
extravagant
notions
that
are
revolting
to
humanity
and
which
too
often
prove
to
be
fatal
in
their
results
their
morals
are
never
correct
and
the
little
they
have
set
loosely
about
them
in
their
own
cases
their
appeals
to
arms
are
not
always
so
prompt
but
in
that
of
their
friends
their
perceptions
of
honor
are
intuitively
keen
and
their
inflexibility
in
preserving
it
from
reproach
unbending
and
such
is
the
weakness
of
mankind
their
tenderness
on
points
where
the
nicer
feelings
of
a
soldier
are
involved
that
these
machines
of
custom
these
thermometers
graduated
to
the
scale
of
false
honor
usurp
the
place
of
reason
and
benevolence
and
become
too
often
the
arbiters
of
life
and
death
to
a
whole
corps
such
then
was
the
confidant
to
whom
jarvis
communicated
the
cause
of
his
disgust
and
the
consequences
may
easily
be
imagined
as
he
passed
emily
and
denbigh
he
threw
a
look
of
fierceness
at
the
latter
which
he
meant
as
an
indication
of
his
hostile
intentions
it
was
lost
on
his
rival
who
at
that
moment
was
filled
with
passions
of
a
very
different
kind
from
those
which
captain
jarvis
thought
agitated
his
own
bosom
for
had
his
new
friend
let
him
alone
the
captain
would
have
gone
quietly
home
and
gone
to
sleep
have
you
ever
fought
said
captain
digby
coolly
to
his
companion
as
they
seated
themselves
in
his
father
parlor
whither
they
had
retired
to
make
their
arrangements
for
the
following
morning
yes
said
jarvis
with
a
stupid
look
i
fought
once
with
tom
halliday
at
school
at
school
my
dear
friend
you
commenced
young
indeed
said
digby
helping
himself
to
another
glass
and
how
did
it
end
oh
tom
got
the
better
and
so
i
cried
enough
said
jarvis
surlily
enough
i
hope
you
did
not
flinch
eyeing
him
keenly
where
were
you
hit
he
hit
me
all
over
all
over
the
d
did
you
use
small
shot
how
did
you
fight
with
fists
said
jarvis
yawning
his
companion
seeing
how
matters
were
rang
for
his
servant
to
put
him
to
bed
remaining
himself
an
hour
longer
to
finish
the
bottle
soon
after
jarvis
had
given
denbigh
the
look
big
with
his
intended
vengeance
colonel
egerton
approached
emily
asking
permission
to
present
sir
herbert
nicholson
the
of
the
regiment
and
a
gentleman
who
was
ambitious
of
the
honor
of
her
acquaintance
a
particular
friend
of
his
own
emily
gracefully
bowed
her
assent
soon
after
turning
her
eyes
on
denbigh
who
had
been
speaking
to
her
at
the
moment
she
saw
him
looking
intently
on
the
two
soldiers
who
were
making
their
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
place
where
she
sat
he
stammered
said
something
she
could
not
understand
and
precipitately
withdrew
and
although
both
she
and
her
aunt
sought
his
figure
in
the
gay
throng
that
flitted
around
them
he
was
seen
no
more
that
evening
are
you
acquainted
with
mr
denbigh
said
emily
to
her
partner
after
looking
in
vain
to
find
his
person
in
the
crowd
denbigh
denbigh
i
have
known
one
or
two
of
that
name
replied
the
gentleman
in
the
army
there
are
several
yes
said
emily
musing
he
is
in
the
army
and
looking
up
she
saw
her
companion
reading
her
countenance
with
an
expression
that
brought
the
color
to
her
cheeks
with
a
glow
that
was
painful
sir
herbert
smiled
and
observed
that
the
room
was
warm
emily
acquiesced
in
the
remark
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
conscious
of
a
feeling
she
was
ashamed
to
have
scrutinized
and
glad
of
any
excuse
to
hide
her
confusion
grace
chatterton
is
really
beautiful
whispered
john
moseley
to
his
sister
clara
i
have
a
mind
to
ask
her
to
dance
do
john
replied
his
sister
looking
with
pleasure
on
her
beautiful
cousin
who
observing
the
movements
of
john
as
he
drew
near
where
she
sat
moved
her
face
on
each
side
rapidly
in
search
of
some
one
who
was
apparently
not
to
be
found
her
breathing
became
sensibly
quicker
and
john
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
to
her
as
the
dowager
stepped
in
between
them
there
is
nothing
so
flattering
to
the
vanity
of
a
man
as
the
discovery
of
emotions
in
a
young
woman
excited
by
himself
and
which
the
party
evidently
wishes
to
conceal
there
is
nothing
so
touching
so
sure
to
captivate
or
if
it
seem
to
be
affected
so
sure
to
disgust
now
moseley
cried
the
mother
you
shall
not
ask
grace
to
dance
she
can
refuse
you
nothing
and
she
has
been
up
the
last
two
figures
your
wishes
are
irresistible
lady
chatterton
said
john
coolly
turning
on
his
heel
on
gaining
the
other
side
of
the
room
he
turned
to
reconnoitre
the
scene
the
dowager
was
fanning
herself
as
violently
as
if
she
had
been
up
the
last
two
figures
instead
of
her
daughter
while
grace
sat
with
her
eyes
fastened
on
the
floor
paler
than
usual
grace
thought
the
young
man
would
be
very
handsome
very
sweet
very
very
everything
that
is
agreeable
if
if
it
were
not
for
mother
chatterton
he
then
led
out
one
of
the
prettiest
girls
in
the
room
egerton
was
peculiarly
fitted
to
shine
in
a
ball
room
he
danced
gracefully
and
with
spirit
was
perfectly
at
home
with
all
the
usages
of
the
best
society
and
was
never
neglectful
of
any
of
those
little
courtesies
which
have
their
charm
for
the
moment
and
jane
moseley
who
saw
all
those
she
loved
around
her
apparently
as
happy
as
herself
found
in
her
judgment
or
the
convictions
of
her
principles
no
counterpoise
against
the
weight
of
such
attractions
all
centred
as
it
were
in
one
effort
to
please
herself
his
flattery
was
deep
for
it
was
respectful
his
tastes
were
her
tastes
his
opinions
her
opinions
on
the
formation
of
their
acquaintance
they
differed
on
some
trifling
point
of
poetical
criticism
and
for
near
a
month
the
colonel
had
maintained
his
opinion
with
a
show
of
firmness
but
opportunities
not
wanting
for
the
discussion
he
had
felt
constrained
to
yield
to
her
better
judgment
her
purer
taste
the
conquest
of
colonel
egerton
was
complete
and
jane
who
saw
in
his
attentions
the
submission
of
a
devoted
heart
began
to
look
forward
to
the
moment
with
trembling
that
was
to
remove
the
thin
barrier
that
existed
between
the
adulation
of
the
eyes
and
the
most
delicate
assiduity
to
please
and
the
open
confidence
of
declared
love
jane
moseley
had
a
heart
to
love
and
to
love
strongly
her
danger
existed
in
her
imagination
it
was
brilliant
unchastened
by
her
judgment
we
had
almost
said
unfettered
by
her
principles
principles
such
as
are
found
in
maxims
and
rules
of
conduct
sufficient
to
restrain
her
within
the
bounds
of
perfect
decorum
she
was
furnished
with
in
abundance
but
to
that
principle
which
was
to
teach
her
submission
in
opposition
to
her
wishes
to
that
principle
that
could
alone
afford
her
security
against
the
treachery
of
her
own
passions
she
was
an
utter
stranger
the
family
of
sir
edward
were
among
the
first
to
retire
and
as
the
chattertons
had
their
own
carriage
wilson
and
her
charge
returned
alone
in
the
coach
of
the
former
emily
who
had
been
rather
out
of
spirits
the
of
the
evening
broke
the
silence
by
suddenly
observing
colonel
egerton
is
or
soon
will
be
a
perfect
hero
her
aunt
somewhat
surprised
both
with
the
abruptness
and
with
the
strength
of
the
remark
inquired
her
meaning
oh
jane
will
make
him
one
whether
or
not
this
was
spoken
with
an
air
of
vexation
which
she
was
unused
to
and
wilson
gravely
corrected
her
for
speaking
in
a
disrespectful
manner
of
her
sister
one
whom
neither
her
years
nor
situation
entitled
her
in
any
measure
to
advise
or
control
there
was
an
impropriety
in
judging
so
near
and
dear
a
relation
harshly
even
in
thought
emily
pressed
the
hand
of
her
aunt
and
tremulously
acknowledged
her
error
but
she
added
that
she
felt
a
momentary
irritation
at
the
idea
of
a
man
of
colonel
egerton
character
gaining
the
command
over
feelings
such
as
her
sister
possessed
wilson
kissed
the
cheek
of
her
niece
while
she
inwardly
acknowledged
the
probable
truth
of
the
very
remark
she
had
thought
it
her
duty
to
censure
that
the
imagination
of
jane
would
supply
her
lover
with
those
qualities
she
most
honored
herself
she
believed
was
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
and
that
when
the
veil
she
had
helped
to
throw
before
her
own
eyes
was
removed
she
would
cease
to
respect
and
of
course
cease
to
love
him
when
too
late
to
remedy
the
evil
she
greatly
feared
but
in
the
approaching
fate
of
jane
she
saw
new
cause
to
call
forth
her
own
activity
emily
moseley
had
just
completed
her
eighteenth
year
and
was
gifted
by
nature
with
a
vivacity
and
ardency
of
feeling
that
gave
a
heightened
zest
to
the
enjoyments
of
that
happy
age
she
was
artless
but
intelligent
cheerful
with
a
deep
conviction
of
the
necessity
of
piety
and
uniform
in
her
practice
of
all
the
important
duties
the
unwearied
exertions
of
her
aunt
aided
by
her
own
quickness
of
perception
had
made
her
familiar
with
the
attainments
suitable
to
her
sex
and
years
for
music
she
had
no
taste
and
the
time
which
would
have
been
thrown
away
in
endeavoring
to
cultivate
a
talent
she
did
not
possess
was
dedicated
under
the
discreet
guidance
of
her
aunt
to
works
which
had
a
tendency
both
to
qualify
her
for
the
duties
of
this
life
and
fit
her
for
that
which
comes
hereafter
it
might
be
said
emily
moseley
had
never
read
a
book
that
contained
a
sentiment
or
inculcated
an
opinion
improper
for
her
sex
or
dangerous
to
her
morals
and
it
was
not
difficult
for
those
who
knew
the
fact
to
fancy
they
could
perceive
the
consequences
in
her
guileless
countenance
and
innocent
deportment
her
looks
her
actions
her
thoughts
wore
as
much
of
nature
as
the
discipline
of
her
mind
and
softened
manners
could
admit
in
person
she
was
of
the
middle
size
exquisitely
formed
graceful
and
elastic
in
her
step
without
however
the
least
departure
from
her
natural
movements
her
eye
was
a
dark
blue
with
an
expression
of
joy
and
intelligence
at
times
it
seemed
all
soul
and
again
all
heart
her
color
was
rather
high
but
it
varied
with
every
emotion
of
her
bosom
her
feelings
were
strong
ardent
and
devoted
to
those
she
loved
her
preceptress
had
never
found
it
necessary
to
repeat
an
admonition
of
any
kind
since
her
arrival
at
years
to
discriminate
between
the
right
and
the
wrong
i
wish
said
doctor
ives
to
his
wife
the
evening
his
son
had
asked
their
permission
to
address
clara
francis
had
chosen
my
little
emily
clara
is
a
good
girl
replied
his
wife
she
is
so
mild
so
affectionate
that
i
doubt
not
she
will
make
him
happy
frank
might
have
done
worse
at
the
hall
for
himself
he
has
done
well
i
hope
said
the
father
a
young
woman
of
clara
heart
may
make
any
man
happy
but
a
union
with
purity
sense
principles
like
those
of
emily
would
be
more
it
would
be
blissful
ives
smiled
at
her
husband
animation
you
remind
me
more
of
the
romantic
youth
i
once
knew
than
of
the
grave
divine
there
is
but
one
man
i
know
that
i
could
wish
to
give
emily
to
it
is
lumley
if
lumley
sees
her
he
will
woo
her
and
if
he
wooes
he
will
win
her
and
lumley
i
believe
to
be
worthy
of
her
cried
the
rector
now
taking
up
a
candle
to
retire
for
the
night
chapter
xiii
the
following
day
brought
a
large
party
of
the
military
elegants
to
the
hall
in
acceptance
of
the
baronet
hospitable
invitation
to
dinner
lady
moseley
was
delighted
so
long
as
her
husband
or
her
interest
had
demanded
a
sacrifice
of
her
love
of
society
it
had
been
made
without
a
sigh
almost
without
a
thought
the
ties
of
affinity
in
her
were
sacred
and
to
the
happiness
the
comfort
of
those
in
which
she
felt
an
interest
there
were
few
sacrifices
of
her
own
propensities
she
would
not
cheerfully
have
made
it
was
this
very
love
of
her
offspring
that
made
her
anxious
to
dispose
of
her
daughters
in
wedlock
her
own
marriage
had
been
so
happy
that
she
naturally
concluded
it
the
state
most
likely
to
ensure
the
happiness
of
her
children
and
with
lady
moseley
as
with
thousands
of
others
who
averse
or
unequal
to
the
labors
of
investigation
jump
to
conclusions
over
the
long
line
of
connecting
reasons
marriage
was
marriage
a
husband
was
a
husband
it
is
true
there
were
certain
indispensables
without
which
the
formation
of
a
connexion
was
a
thing
she
considered
not
within
the
bounds
of
nature
there
must
be
fitness
in
fortune
in
condition
in
education
and
manners
there
must
be
no
glaring
evil
although
she
did
not
ask
for
positive
good
a
professor
of
religion
herself
had
any
one
told
her
it
was
a
duty
of
her
calling
to
guard
against
a
connexion
with
any
but
a
christian
for
her
girls
she
would
have
wondered
at
the
ignorance
that
would
embarrass
the
married
state
with
feelings
exclusively
belonging
to
the
individual
had
any
one
told
her
it
were
possible
to
give
her
child
to
any
but
a
gentleman
she
would
have
wondered
at
the
want
of
feeling
that
could
devote
the
softness
of
jane
or
emily
to
the
association
with
rudeness
or
vulgarity
it
was
the
misfortune
of
lady
moseley
to
limit
her
views
of
marriage
to
the
scene
of
this
life
forgetful
that
every
union
gives
existence
to
a
long
line
of
immortal
beings
whose
future
welfare
depends
greatly
on
the
force
of
early
examples
or
the
strength
of
early
impressions
the
necessity
for
restriction
in
their
expenditures
had
ceased
and
the
baronet
and
his
wife
greatly
enjoyed
the
first
opportunity
their
secluded
situation
had
given
them
to
draw
around
their
board
their
of
their
own
stamp
in
the
former
it
was
pure
philanthropy
the
same
feeling
urged
him
to
seek
out
and
relieve
distress
in
humble
life
while
in
the
latter
it
was
love
of
station
and
seemliness
it
was
becoming
the
owner
of
moseley
hall
and
it
was
what
the
daughters
of
the
benfield
family
had
done
since
the
conquest
i
am
extremely
sorry
said
the
good
baronet
at
dinner
denbigh
declined
our
invitation
i
hope
he
will
yet
ride
over
in
the
evening
looks
of
a
singular
import
were
exchanged
between
colonel
egerton
and
sir
herbert
nicholson
at
the
mention
of
denbigh
name
which
as
the
latter
had
just
asked
the
favor
of
taking
wine
with
wilson
did
not
escape
her
notice
emily
had
innocently
mentioned
his
precipitate
retreat
the
night
before
and
he
had
when
reminded
of
his
engagement
to
dine
with
them
that
very
day
and
promised
an
introduction
to
sir
herbert
nicholson
by
john
in
her
presence
suddenly
excused
himself
and
withdrawn
with
an
indefinite
suspicion
of
something
wrong
she
ventured
therefore
to
address
sir
herbert
nicholson
did
you
know
denbigh
in
spain
i
told
miss
emily
moseley
i
believe
last
evening
that
i
knew
some
of
the
name
replied
the
gentleman
evasively
then
pausing
a
moment
he
added
with
great
emphasis
there
is
a
circumstance
connected
with
one
of
that
name
i
shall
ever
remember
it
was
creditable
no
doubt
sir
herbert
cried
young
jarvis
sarcastically
the
soldier
affected
not
to
hear
the
question
and
asked
jane
to
take
wine
with
him
lord
chatterton
however
putting
his
knife
and
fork
down
gravely
and
with
a
glow
of
animation
observed
with
unusual
spirit
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
sir
jarvis
in
his
turn
affected
not
to
hear
this
speech
and
nothing
farther
was
said
as
sir
edward
saw
that
the
name
of
denbigh
excited
a
sensation
amongst
his
guests
for
which
he
was
unable
to
account
and
which
he
soon
forgot
himself
after
the
company
had
retired
lord
chatterton
however
related
to
the
astonished
and
indignant
family
of
the
baronet
the
substance
of
the
following
scene
of
which
he
had
been
a
witness
that
morning
while
on
a
visit
to
denbigh
at
the
rectory
they
had
been
sitting
in
the
parlor
by
themselves
over
their
breakfast
when
a
captain
digby
was
announced
i
have
the
honor
of
waiting
upon
you
denbigh
said
the
soldier
with
the
stiff
formality
of
a
professed
duellist
on
behalf
of
captain
jarvis
but
will
postpone
my
business
until
you
are
at
leisure
glancing
his
eye
on
chatterton
i
know
of
no
business
with
captain
jarvis
said
denbigh
politely
handing
the
stranger
a
chair
to
which
lord
chatterton
can
not
be
privy
if
he
will
excuse
the
interruption
the
nobleman
bowed
and
captain
digby
a
little
awed
by
the
rank
of
denbigh
friend
proceeded
in
a
more
measured
manner
captain
jarvis
has
empowered
me
sir
to
make
any
arrangement
with
yourself
or
friend
previously
to
your
meeting
which
he
hopes
may
be
as
soon
as
possible
if
convenient
to
yourself
replied
the
soldier
coolly
denbigh
viewed
him
for
a
moment
with
astonishment
in
silence
when
recollecting
himself
he
said
mildly
and
without
the
least
agitation
i
can
not
affect
sir
not
to
understand
your
meaning
but
am
at
a
loss
to
imagine
what
act
of
mine
can
have
made
jarvis
wish
to
make
such
an
appeal
surely
denbigh
can
not
think
a
man
of
captain
jarvis
spirit
can
quietly
submit
to
the
indignity
put
upon
him
last
evening
by
your
dancing
with
miss
moseley
after
she
had
declined
the
honor
to
himself
said
the
captain
affecting
an
incredulous
smile
my
lord
chatterton
and
myself
can
easily
settle
the
preliminaries
as
captain
jarvis
is
much
disposed
to
consult
your
wishes
sir
in
this
affair
if
he
consults
my
wishes
said
denbigh
smiling
he
will
think
no
more
about
it
at
what
time
sir
will
it
be
convenient
to
give
him
the
meeting
then
speaking
with
a
kind
of
bravado
gentlemen
of
his
cast
are
fond
of
assuming
my
friend
would
not
hurry
any
settlement
of
your
affairs
i
can
never
meet
captain
jarvis
with
hostile
intentions
replied
denbigh
calmly
sir
i
decline
the
combat
sir
said
denbigh
with
more
firmness
your
reasons
sir
if
you
please
asked
captain
digby
compressing
his
lips
and
drawing
up
with
an
air
of
personal
interest
surely
cried
chatterton
who
had
with
difficulty
estrained
his
feelings
surely
denbigh
could
never
so
far
forget
himself
as
cruelly
to
expose
miss
moseley
by
accepting
this
invitation
your
reason
my
lord
said
denbigh
with
interest
would
at
all
times
have
its
weight
but
i
wish
not
to
qualify
an
act
of
what
i
conceive
to
be
principle
by
any
lesser
consideration
i
can
not
meet
captain
jarvis
or
any
other
man
in
private
combat
there
can
exist
no
necessity
for
an
appeal
to
arms
in
any
society
where
the
laws
rule
and
i
am
averse
to
bloodshed
very
extraordinary
muttered
captain
digby
somewhat
at
a
loss
how
to
act
but
the
calm
and
collected
manner
of
denbigh
prevented
a
reply
and
after
declining
a
cup
of
tea
a
liquor
he
never
drank
he
withdrew
saying
he
would
acquaint
his
friend
with
denbigh
singular
notions
captain
digby
had
left
jarvis
at
an
inn
about
half
a
mile
from
the
rectory
for
the
convenience
of
receiving
early
information
of
the
result
of
his
conference
the
young
man
had
walked
up
and
down
the
room
during
digby
absence
in
a
train
of
reflections
entirely
new
to
him
he
was
the
only
son
of
his
aged
father
and
mother
the
protector
of
his
sisters
and
he
might
say
the
sole
hope
of
a
rising
family
and
then
possibly
denbigh
might
not
have
meant
to
offend
him
he
might
even
have
been
engaged
before
they
came
to
the
house
or
if
not
it
might
have
been
inadvertence
on
the
part
of
miss
moseley
that
denbigh
would
offer
some
explanation
he
believed
and
he
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
accept
it
let
it
be
what
it
might
as
his
fighting
friend
entered
well
said
jarvis
in
a
tone
that
denoted
anything
but
a
consciousness
that
all
was
well
he
says
he
will
not
meet
you
dryly
exclaimed
his
friend
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
and
ordering
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
not
meet
me
exclaimed
jarvis
in
surprise
engaged
perhaps
engaged
to
his
d
d
conscience
to
his
conscience
i
do
not
know
whether
i
rightly
understand
you
captain
digby
said
jarvis
catching
his
breath
and
raising
his
voice
a
very
little
then
captain
jarvis
said
his
friend
tossing
off
his
brandy
and
speaking
with
great
deliberation
he
says
that
nothing
understand
me
nothing
will
ever
make
him
fight
a
duel
he
will
not
cried
jarvis
in
a
loud
voice
no
he
will
not
said
digby
handing
his
glass
to
the
waiter
for
a
fresh
supply
he
shall
by
i
do
know
how
you
will
make
him
make
him
i
i
post
him
never
do
that
said
the
captain
turning
to
him
as
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
it
only
makes
both
parties
ridiculous
but
tell
you
what
you
may
do
there
a
lord
chatterton
who
takes
the
matter
up
with
warmth
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
his
interests
hurting
my
promotion
i
should
have
resented
something
that
fell
from
him
myself
he
will
fight
i
dare
say
and
i
just
return
and
require
an
explanation
of
his
words
on
your
behalf
no
no
said
jarvis
rather
hastily
he
he
is
related
to
the
moseleys
and
i
have
views
there
it
might
injure
did
you
think
to
forward
your
views
by
making
the
young
lady
the
subject
of
a
duel
asked
captain
digby
sarcastically
and
eyeing
his
companion
with
contempt
yes
yes
said
jarvis
it
would
certainly
hurt
my
views
here
to
the
health
of
his
majesty
gallant
regiment
of
foot
cried
captain
digby
in
a
tone
of
irony
when
drunk
at
the
that
evening
and
to
its
champion
captain
henry
jarvis
one
of
the
corps
was
present
accidentally
as
a
guest
and
the
following
week
the
inhabitants
of
f
saw
the
regiment
in
their
barracks
marching
to
slow
time
after
the
body
of
horace
digby
lord
chatterton
in
relating
the
part
of
the
foregoing
circumstances
which
fell
under
his
observation
did
ample
justice
to
the
conduct
of
denbigh
a
degree
of
liberality
which
did
him
no
little
credit
as
he
plainly
saw
in
that
gentleman
he
had
or
soon
would
have
a
rival
in
the
dearest
wish
of
his
heart
and
the
smiling
approbation
with
which
his
cousin
emily
rewarded
him
for
his
candor
almost
sickened
him
with
apprehension
the
ladies
were
not
slow
in
expressing
their
disgust
at
the
conduct
of
jarvis
or
backward
in
their
approval
of
forbearance
lady
moseley
turned
with
horror
from
a
picture
in
which
she
could
see
nothing
but
murder
and
bloodshed
but
both
wilson
and
her
niece
secretly
applauded
a
sacrifice
of
worldly
feelings
on
the
altar
of
duty
the
former
admiring
the
consistent
refusal
of
admitting
any
collateral
inducements
in
explanation
of
his
decision
the
latter
while
she
saw
the
act
in
its
true
colors
could
hardly
help
believing
that
a
regard
for
her
feelings
had
in
a
trifling
degree
its
influence
in
inducing
him
to
decline
the
meeting
wilson
saw
at
once
what
a
hold
such
unusual
conduct
would
take
on
the
feelings
of
her
niece
and
inwardly
determined
to
increase
if
possible
the
watchfulness
she
had
invariably
observed
on
all
he
said
or
did
as
likely
to
elucidate
his
real
character
well
knowing
that
the
requisites
to
bring
or
to
keep
happiness
in
the
married
state
were
numerous
and
indispensable
and
that
the
display
of
a
particular
excellence
however
good
in
itself
was
by
no
means
conclusive
as
to
character
in
short

perhaps
as
often
meet
with
a
favorite
principle
as
with
a
besetting
sin
chapter
xiv
sir
edward
moseley
had
some
difficulty
in
restraining
the
impetuosity
of
his
son
who
was
disposed
to
resent
this
impertinent
interference
of
young
jarvis
with
the
conduct
of
his
favorite
sister
indeed
the
young
man
only
yielded
to
his
profound
respect
to
his
father
commands
aided
by
a
strong
representation
on
the
part
of
his
sister
of
the
disagreeable
consequences
of
connecting
her
name
with
such
a
quarrel
it
was
seldom
the
good
baronet
felt
himself
called
on
to
act
as
decidedly
as
on
the
present
occasion
he
spoke
to
the
merchant
in
warm
but
terms
of
the
consequences
which
might
have
resulted
to
his
own
child
from
the
intemperate
act
of
his
son
exculpated
emily
entirely
from
censure
by
explaining
her
engagement
to
dance
with
denbigh
previously
to
captain
jarvis
application
and
hinted
the
necessity
if
the
affair
was
not
amicably
terminated
of
protecting
the
peace
of
mind
of
his
daughters
against
any
similar
exposures
by
declining
the
acquaintance
of
a
neighbor
he
respected
as
much
as
jarvis
the
merchant
was
a
man
of
few
words
but
of
great
promptitude
he
had
made
his
fortune
and
more
than
once
saved
it
by
his
decision
and
assuring
the
baronet
he
should
hear
no
more
of
it
he
took
his
hat
and
hurried
home
from
the
village
where
the
conversation
passed
on
arriving
at
his
own
house
he
found
the
family
collected
in
the
parlor
for
a
morning
ride
and
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
he
broke
out
on
the
whole
party
with
great
violence
so
jarvis
he
cried
you
would
spoil
a
very
tolerable
keeper
by
wishing
to
have
a
soldier
in
your
family
and
there
stands
the
puppy
who
would
have
blown
out
the
brains
of
a
deserving
young
man
if
the
good
sense
of
denbigh
had
not
denied
him
the
opportunity
mercy
cried
the
alarmed
matron
on
whom
newgate
for
her
early
life
had
been
passed
near
its
walls
with
all
its
horrors
floated
and
a
contemplation
of
its
punishments
had
been
her
juvenile
lessons
of
morality
harry
harry
would
you
commit
murder
murder
echoed
her
son
looking
askance
as
if
dodging
the
bailiffs
no
mother
i
wanted
nothing
but
what
was
fair
denbigh
would
have
had
an
equal
chance
to
blow
out
my
brains
i
am
sure
everything
would
have
been
fair
equal
chance
muttered
his
father
who
had
cooled
himself
in
some
measure
by
an
extra
pinch
of
snuff
no
sir
you
have
no
brains
to
lose
but
i
have
promised
sir
edward
that
you
shall
make
proper
apologies
to
himself
to
his
daughter
and
to
mr
denbigh
this
was
rather
exceeding
the
truth
but
the
alderman
prided
himself
on
performing
rather
more
than
he
promised
apology
exclaimed
the
captain
why
sir
the
apology
is
due
to
me
ask
colonel
egerton
if
he
ever
heard
of
apologies
being
made
by
the
challenger
no
sure
said
the
mother
who
having
made
out
the
truth
of
the
matter
thought
it
was
likely
enough
to
be
creditable
to
her
child
colonel
egerton
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
did
you
colonel
why
madam
said
the
colonel
hesitatingly
and
politely
handing
the
merchant
his
which
in
his
agitation
had
fallen
on
the
floor
circumstances
sometimes
justify
a
departure
from
ordinary
measures
you
are
certainly
right
as
a
rule
but
not
knowing
the
particulars
in
the
present
case
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
decide
miss
jarvis
the
tilbury
is
ready
the
colonel
bowed
respectfully
to
the
merchant
kissed
his
hand
to
his
wife
and
led
their
daughter
to
his
carriage
do
you
make
the
apologies
asked
jarvis
as
the
door
closed
no
sir
replied
the
captain
sullenly
then
you
must
make
your
pay
answer
for
the
next
six
months
cried
the
father
taking
a
signed
draft
on
his
banker
from
his
pocket
coolly
tearing
it
in
two
pieces
carefully
putting
the
name
in
his
mouth
and
chewing
it
into
a
ball
why
alderman
said
his
wife
a
name
she
never
used
unless
she
had
something
to
gain
from
her
spouse
who
loved
to
hear
the
appellation
after
he
had
relinquished
the
office
it
appears
to
me
that
harry
has
shown
nothing
but
a
proper
spirit
you
are
unkind
indeed
you
are
a
proper
spirit
in
what
way
do
you
know
anything
of
the
matter
it
is
a
proper
spirit
for
a
soldier
to
fight
i
suppose
said
the
wife
a
little
at
a
loss
to
explain
spirit
or
no
spirit
apology
or
ten
and
sixpence
harry
said
his
mother
holding
up
her
finger
in
a
menacing
attitude
as
soon
as
her
husband
had
left
the
room
for
he
had
last
spoken
with
the
door
in
his
hand
if
you
do
beg
his
pardon
you
are
no
son
of
mine
no
cried
miss
sarah
nor
any
brother
of
mine
it
would
be
insufferably
mean
who
will
pay
my
debts
asked
the
son
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
why
i
would
my
child
if
if
i
had
not
spent
my
own
allowance
i
would
echoed
the
sister
but
if
we
go
to
bath
you
know
i
shall
want
all
my
money
who
will
pay
my
debts
repeated
the
son
apology
indeed
who
is
he
that
you
a
son
of
alderman
of
jarvis
of
the
deanery
b
north
should
beg
his
pardon
a
vagrant
that
nobody
knows
who
will
pay
my
debts
again
inquired
the
captain
drumming
with
his
foot
harry
exclaimed
the
mother
do
you
love
money
better
than
honor
a
soldier
honor
no
mother
but
i
like
good
eating
and
drinking
think
mother
it
a
cool
five
hundred
and
that
a
famous
deal
of
money
harry
cried
the
mother
in
a
rage
you
are
not
fit
for
a
soldier
i
wish
i
were
in
your
place
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
you
had
been
for
an
hour
this
morning
thought
the
son
after
arguing
for
some
time
longer
they
compromised
by
agreeing
to
leave
it
to
the
decision
of
colonel
egerton
who
the
mother
did
not
doubt
would
applaud
her
maintaining
the
jarvis
dignity
a
family
in
which
he
took
quite
as
much
interest
as
he
felt
for
his
he
had
told
her
fifty
times
the
captain
however
determined
within
himself
to
touch
the
five
hundred
let
the
colonel
decide
as
he
might
but
the
colonel
decision
obviated
all
difficulties
the
question
was
put
to
him
by
jarvis
on
his
return
from
the
airing
with
no
doubt
the
decision
would
be
favorable
to
her
opinion
the
colonel
and
herself
she
said
never
disagreed
and
the
lady
was
right
for
wherever
his
interest
made
it
desirable
to
convert
jarvis
to
his
side
of
the
question
egerton
had
a
manner
of
doing
it
that
never
failed
to
succeed
why
madam
said
he
with
one
of
his
most
agreeable
smiles
apologies
are
different
things
at
different
times
you
are
certainly
right
in
your
sentiments
as
relates
to
a
proper
spirit
in
a
soldier
but
no
one
can
doubt
the
spirit
of
the
captain
after
the
stand
he
took
in
this
affair
if
denbigh
would
not
meet
him
a
very
extraordinary
measure
in
deed
i
confess
what
can
your
son
do
more
he
can
not
make
a
man
fight
against
his
will
you
know
true
true
cried
the
matron
impatiently
i
do
not
want
him
to
fight
heaven
forbid
but
why
should
he
the
challenger
beg
pardon
i
am
sure
to
have
the
thing
regular
denbigh
is
the
one
to
ask
forgiveness
the
colonel
felt
at
a
little
loss
how
to
reply
when
jarvis
in
whom
the
thoughts
of
the
five
hundred
pounds
had
worked
a
revolution
exclaimed
you
know
mother
i
accused
him
that
is
i
suspected
him
of
dancing
with
miss
moseley
against
my
right
to
her
now
you
find
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
and
so
i
had
better
act
with
dignity
and
confess
my
error
oh
by
all
means
cried
the
colonel
who
saw
the
danger
of
an
embarrassing
rupture
between
the
families
otherwise
delicacy
to
your
sex
particularly
requires
that
from
your
son
and
he
accidentally
dropped
a
letter
as
he
spoke
from
sir
edgar
colonel
asked
jarvis
as
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
from
sir
edgar
and
he
begs
to
be
remembered
to
yourself
and
all
of
your
amiable
family
jarvis
inclined
her
body
in
what
she
intended
for
a
graceful
bend
and
sighed
a
casual
observer
might
have
thought
with
maternal
anxiety
for
the
reputation
of
her
child
but
it
was
conjugal
regret
that
the
political
obstinacy
of
the
alderman
had
prevented
his
carrying
up
an
address
and
thus
becoming
sir
timothy
sir
edgar
heir
prevailed
and
the
captain
received
permission
to
do
what
he
had
done
several
hours
before
on
leaving
the
room
after
the
first
discussion
and
before
the
appeal
the
captain
had
hastened
to
his
father
with
his
concessions
the
old
gentleman
knew
too
well
the
influence
of
five
hundred
pounds
to
doubt
the
effect
in
the
present
instance
and
he
had
ordered
his
carriage
for
the
excursion
it
came
and
to
the
hall
they
proceeded
the
captain
found
his
intended
antagonist
and
in
a
rather
uncouth
manner
he
made
the
required
concession
he
was
restored
to
his
former
favor
no
great
distinction
and
his
visits
to
the
hall
were
suffered
but
with
a
dislike
emily
could
never
conquer
nor
at
all
times
conceal
denbigh
was
occupied
with
a
book
when
jarvis
commenced
his
speech
to
the
baronet
and
his
daughter
and
was
apparently
too
much
engaged
with
its
contents
to
understand
what
was
going
on
as
the
captain
blundered
through
it
was
necessary
the
captain
saw
by
a
glance
of
his
eyes
to
say
something
to
that
gentleman
who
had
delicately
withdrawn
to
a
distant
window
his
speech
was
consequently
made
here
too
and
wilson
could
not
avoid
stealing
a
look
at
them
denbigh
smiled
and
bowed
in
silence
it
is
enough
thought
the
widow
the
offence
was
not
against
him
it
was
against
his
maker
he
should
not
arrogate
to
himself
in
any
manner
the
right
to
forgive
or
to
require
apologies
the
whole
is
consistent
the
subject
was
never
afterwards
alluded
to
denbigh
appeared
to
have
forgotten
it
and
jane
sighed
gently
as
she
devoutly
hoped
the
colonel
was
not
a
duellist
several
days
passed
before
the
deanery
ladies
could
sufficiently
forgive
the
indignity
their
family
had
sustained
to
resume
the
customary
intercourse
like
all
other
grievances
where
the
passions
are
chiefly
interested
it
was
forgotten
in
time
however
and
things
were
put
in
some
measure
on
their
former
footing
the
death
of
digby
served
to
increase
the
horror
of
the
moseleys
and
jarvis
himself
felt
rather
uncomfortable
on
more
accounts
than
one
at
the
fatal
termination
of
the
unpleasant
business
chatterton
who
to
his
friends
had
not
hesitated
to
avow
his
attachment
to
his
cousin
but
who
had
never
proposed
for
her
as
his
present
views
and
fortune
were
not
in
his
estimation
sufficient
for
her
proper
support
had
pushed
every
interest
he
possessed
and
left
no
steps
unattempted
an
honorable
man
could
resort
to
to
effect
his
object
the
desire
to
provide
for
his
sisters
had
been
backed
by
the
ardor
of
a
passion
that
had
reached
its
crisis
and
the
young
peer
who
could
not
in
the
present
state
of
things
abandon
the
field
to
a
rival
so
formidable
as
denbigh
even
to
further
his
views
to
preferment
was
waiting
in
anxious
suspense
the
decision
on
his
application
a
letter
from
his
friend
informed
him
his
opponent
was
likely
to
succeed
that
in
short
all
hopes
of
success
had
left
him
chatterton
was
in
despair
on
the
following
day
however
he
received
a
second
letter
from
the
same
friend
unexpectedly
announcing
his
appointment
after
mentioning
the
fact
he
went
on
to
say
the
cause
of
this
sudden
revolution
in
your
favor
is
unknown
to
me
and
unless
your
lordship
has
obtained
interest
i
am
ignorant
of
it
is
one
of
the
most
singular
instances
of
ministerial
caprice
i
have
ever
known
chatterton
was
as
much
at
a
loss
as
his
friend
to
understand
the
affair
but
it
mattered
not
he
could
now
offer
to
emily
it
was
a
patent
office
of
great
value
and
a
few
years
would
amply
portion
his
sisters
that
very
day
therefore
he
proposed
and
was
refused
emily
had
a
difficult
task
to
avoid
in
regulating
her
deportment
on
this
occasion
she
was
fond
of
chatterton
as
a
relation
as
her
brother
friend
as
the
brother
of
grace
and
even
on
his
own
account
but
it
was
the
fondness
of
a
sister
his
manner
his
words
which
although
never
addressed
to
herself
were
sometimes
overheard
unintentionally
and
sometimes
reached
her
through
her
sisters
had
left
her
in
no
doubt
of
his
attachment
she
was
excessively
grieved
at
the
discovery
and
had
innocently
appealed
to
her
aunt
for
directions
how
to
proceed
of
his
intentions
she
had
no
doubt
but
at
the
same
time
he
had
not
put
her
in
a
situation
to
dispel
his
hopes
as
to
encouragement
in
the
usual
meaning
of
the
term
she
gave
none
to
him
nor
to
any
one
else
there
are
no
little
attentions
that
lovers
are
fond
of
showing
to
their
mistresses
and
which
mistresses
are
fond
of
receiving
that
emily
ever
permitted
to
any
gentleman
no
rides
no
walks
no
always
natural
and
unaffected
there
was
a
simple
dignity
about
her
that
forbade
the
request
almost
the
thought
in
the
gentlemen
of
her
acquaintance
she
had
no
amusements
no
pleasures
of
any
kind
in
which
her
sisters
were
not
her
companions
and
if
anything
was
on
the
carpet
that
required
an
attendant
john
was
ever
ready
he
was
devoted
to
her
the
decided
preference
she
gave
him
over
every
other
man
upon
such
occasions
flattered
his
affection
and
he
would
at
any
time
leave
even
grace
chatterton
to
attend
his
sister
all
this
too
was
without
affectation
and
generally
without
notice
emily
so
looked
the
delicacy
and
reserve
she
acted
with
so
little
ostentation
that
not
even
her
own
sex
had
affixed
to
her
conduct
the
epithet
of
squeamish
it
was
difficult
therefore
for
her
to
do
anything
which
would
show
lord
chatterton
her
disinclination
to
his
suit
without
assuming
a
dislike
she
did
not
feel
or
giving
him
slights
that
neither
good
breeding
nor
good
nature
could
justify
at
one
time
indeed
she
had
expressed
a
wish
to
return
to
clara
but
this
wilson
thought
would
only
protract
the
evil
and
she
was
compelled
to
wait
his
own
time
the
peer
himself
did
not
rejoice
more
in
his
ability
to
make
the
offer
therefore
than
emily
did
to
have
it
in
her
power
to
decline
it
her
rejection
was
firm
and
unqualified
but
uttered
with
a
grace
and
a
tenderness
to
his
feelings
that
bound
her
lover
tighter
than
ever
in
her
chains
and
he
resolved
on
immediate
flight
as
his
only
recourse
i
hope
nothing
unpleasant
has
occurred
to
lord
chatterton
said
denbigh
with
great
interest
as
he
reached
the
spot
where
the
young
peer
stood
leaning
his
head
against
a
tree
on
his
way
from
the
rectory
to
the
hall
chatterton
raised
his
face
as
he
spoke
there
were
evident
traces
of
tears
on
it
and
denbigh
greatly
shocked
was
about
to
proceed
as
the
other
caught
his
arm
denbigh
said
the
young
man
in
a
voice
almost
choked
with
emotion
may
you
never
know
the
pain
i
have
felt
this
morning
emily
emily
moseley
is
lost
to
me
for
ever
for
a
moment
the
blood
rushed
to
the
face
of
denbigh
and
his
eyes
flashed
with
a
look
that
chatterton
could
not
stand
he
turned
as
the
voice
of
denbigh
in
those
remarkable
tones
which
distinguished
it
from
every
other
voice
he
had
ever
heard
uttered
chatterton
my
lord
we
are
friends
i
hope
i
wish
it
from
my
heart
go
denbigh
go
you
were
going
to
miss
moseley
do
not
let
me
detain
you
i
am
going
with
you
lord
chatterton
unless
you
forbid
it
said
denbigh
with
emphasis
slipping
his
arm
through
that
of
the
peer
for
two
hours
they
walked
together
in
the
park
and
when
they
appeared
at
dinner
emily
wondered
why
denbigh
had
taken
a
seat
next
to
her
mother
instead
of
his
usual
place
between
herself
and
her
aunt
in
the
evening
he
announced
his
intention
of
leaving
b
for
a
short
time
with
lord
chatterton
they
were
going
to
london
together
but
he
hoped
to
return
within
ten
days
this
sudden
determination
caused
some
surprise
but
as
the
dowager
supposed
it
was
to
secure
the
new
situation
and
the
remainder
of
their
friends
thought
it
might
be
business
it
was
soon
forgotten
though
much
regretted
for
the
time
the
gentlemen
left
the
hall
that
night
to
proceed
to
an
inn
from
which
they
could
obtain
a
chaise
and
horses
and
the
following
morning
when
the
baronet
family
assembled
around
their
social
breakfast
they
were
many
miles
on
the
road
to
the
metropolis
chapter
xv
lady
chatterton
finding
that
little
was
to
be
expected
in
her
present
situation
excepting
what
she
looked
forward
to
from
the
varying
admiration
of
john
moseley
to
her
youngest
daughter
determined
to
accept
an
invitation
of
some
standing
to
a
nobleman
seat
about
fifty
miles
from
the
hall
and
in
order
to
keep
things
in
their
proper
places
to
leave
grace
with
her
friends
who
had
expressed
a
wish
to
that
effect
accordingly
the
day
succeeding
the
departure
of
her
son
she
proceeded
on
her
expedition
accompanied
by
her
willing
assistant
in
the
matrimonial
speculations
grace
chatterton
was
by
nature
retiring
and
delicate
but
her
feelings
were
acute
and
on
the
subject
of
female
propriety
sensitive
to
a
degree
that
the
great
want
of
it
in
a
relation
she
loved
as
much
as
her
mother
had
possibly
in
some
measure
increased
her
affections
were
too
single
in
their
objects
to
have
left
her
long
in
doubt
as
to
their
nature
with
respect
to
the
baronet
son
and
it
was
one
of
the
most
painful
orders
she
had
ever
received
that
which
compelled
her
to
accept
her
cousin
invitation
her
mother
was
peremptory
however
and
grace
was
obliged
to
comply
every
delicate
feeling
she
possessed
revolted
at
the
step
the
visit
itself
was
unwished
for
on
her
part
but
there
did
exist
a
reason
which
had
reconciled
her
to
that
the
wedding
of
clara
but
now
to
remain
after
all
her
family
had
gone
in
the
house
where
resided
the
man
who
had
as
yet
never
solicited
those
affections
she
had
been
unable
to
withhold
it
was
humiliating
it
was
degrading
her
in
her
own
esteem
and
she
could
scarcely
endure
it
it
is
said
that
women
are
fertile
in
inventions
to
further
their
schemes
of
personal
gratification
vanity
or
even
mischief
it
may
be
it
is
true
but
the
writer
of
these
pages
is
a
man
one
who
has
seen
much
of
the
other
sex
and
he
is
happy
to
have
an
opportunity
of
paying
a
tribute
to
female
purity
and
female
truth
that
there
are
hearts
so
disinterested
as
to
lose
the
considerations
of
self
in
advancing
the
happiness
of
those
they
love
that
there
are
minds
so
pure
as
to
recoil
with
disgust
from
the
admission
of
deception
indelicacy
or
management
he
knows
for
he
has
seen
it
from
long
and
close
examination
he
regrets
that
the
very
artlessness
of
those
who
are
most
pure
in
the
one
sex
subjects
them
to
the
suspicions
of
the
grosser
materials
which
compose
the
other
he
believes
that
innocency
singleness
of
heart
ardency
of
feeling
and
unalloyed
shrinking
delicacy
sometimes
exist
in
the
female
bosom
to
an
extent
that
but
few
men
are
happy
enough
to
discover
and
that
most
men
believe
incompatible
with
the
frailties
of
human
nature
grace
chatterton
possessed
no
little
of
what
may
almost
be
called
this
ethereal
spirit
and
a
visit
to
bolton
parsonage
was
immediately
proposed
by
her
to
emily
the
latter
too
innocent
herself
to
suspect
the
motives
of
her
cousin
was
happy
to
be
allowed
to
devote
a
fortnight
to
clara
uninterrupted
by
the
noisy
round
of
visiting
and
congratulations
which
had
attended
her
first
week
and
wilson
and
the
two
girls
left
the
hall
the
same
day
with
the
dowager
lady
chatterton
francis
and
clara
were
happy
to
receive
them
and
they
were
immediately
domesticated
in
their
new
abode
doctor
ives
and
his
wife
had
postponed
an
annual
visit
to
a
relation
of
the
former
on
account
of
the
marriage
of
their
son
and
they
now
availed
themselves
of
this
visit
to
perform
their
own
engagement
b
appeared
in
some
measure
deserted
and
egerton
had
the
field
almost
to
himself
summer
had
arrived
and
the
country
bloomed
in
all
its
luxuriance
of
vegetation
everything
was
propitious
to
the
indulgence
of
the
softer
passions
and
lady
moseley
ever
a
strict
adherent
to
forms
and
decorum
admitted
the
intercourse
between
jane
and
her
admirer
to
be
carried
to
as
great
lengths
as
those
forms
would
justify
still
the
colonel
was
not
explicit
and
jane
whose
delicacy
dreaded
the
exposure
of
feelings
that
was
involved
in
his
declaration
gave
or
sought
no
marked
opportunities
for
the
avowal
of
his
passion
yet
they
were
seldom
separate
and
both
sir
edward
and
his
wife
looked
forward
to
their
future
union
as
a
thing
not
to
be
doubted
lady
moseley
had
given
up
her
youngest
child
so
absolutely
to
the
government
of
her
aunt
that
she
seldom
thought
of
her
future
establishment
she
had
that
kind
of
reposing
confidence
in
wilson
proceedings
that
feeble
minds
ever
bestow
on
those
who
are
much
superior
to
them
and
she
even
approved
of
a
system
in
many
respects
which
she
could
not
endeavor
to
imitate
her
affection
for
emily
was
not
however
less
than
what
she
felt
for
her
other
children
she
was
in
fact
her
favorite
and
had
the
discipline
of
wilson
admitted
of
so
weak
an
interference
might
have
been
injured
as
such
john
moseley
had
been
able
to
find
out
exactly
the
hour
they
breakfasted
at
the
deanery
the
length
of
time
it
took
egerton
horses
to
go
the
distance
between
that
house
and
the
hall
and
on
the
sixth
morning
after
the
departure
of
his
aunt
john
bays
were
in
his
phaeton
and
allowing
ten
minutes
for
the
mile
and
a
half
to
the
park
gates
john
had
got
happily
off
his
own
territories
before
he
met
the
tilbury
travelling
eastward
i
am
not
to
know
which
road
the
colonel
may
turn
thought
john
and
after
a
few
friendly
but
rather
hasty
greetings
the
bays
were
again
in
full
trot
to
the
parsonage
john
said
emily
holding
out
her
hand
affectionately
and
smiling
a
little
archly
as
he
approached
the
window
where
she
stood
you
should
take
a
lesson
in
driving
from
frank
you
have
turned
more
than
one
hair
i
believe
how
is
clara
cried
john
hastily
taking
the
offered
hand
with
a
kiss
aye
and
aunt
wilson
both
well
brother
and
out
walking
this
fine
morning
how
happens
it
you
are
not
with
them
inquired
the
brother
throwing
his
eyes
round
the
room
have
they
left
you
alone
no
grace
has
this
moment
left
me
well
emily
said
john
taking
his
seat
very
composedly
but
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
door
i
have
come
to
dine
with
you
i
thought
i
owed
clara
a
visit
and
have
managed
nicely
to
give
the
colonel
the
clara
will
be
happy
to
see
you
dear
john
and
so
will
aunt
and
so
am
i
as
she
drew
aside
his
fine
hair
with
her
fingers
to
cool
his
forehead
and
why
not
grace
too
asked
john
with
a
look
of
a
little
alarm
and
grace
too
i
fancy
but
here
she
is
to
answer
for
herself
grace
said
little
on
her
entrance
but
her
eyes
were
brighter
than
usual
and
she
looked
so
contented
and
happy
that
emily
observed
to
her
in
an
affectionate
manner
i
knew
the
would
do
your
head
good
is
miss
chatterton
unwell
asked
john
with
a
look
of
interest
a
slight
headache
said
grace
faintly
but
i
feel
much
better
want
of
air
and
exercise
my
horses
are
at
the
door
phaeton
will
hold
three
easily
run
sister
for
your
hat
almost
pushing
emily
out
of
the
room
as
he
spoke
in
a
few
minutes
the
horses
might
have
been
suffering
for
air
but
surely
not
for
exercise
i
wish
cried
john
with
impatience
when
at
the
distance
of
a
couple
of
miles
from
the
parsonage
that
gentleman
had
driven
his
gig
out
of
the
road
there
was
a
small
group
on
one
side
of
the
road
consisting
of
a
man
a
woman
and
several
children
the
owner
of
the
gig
had
alighted
and
was
in
the
act
of
speaking
to
them
as
the
phaeton
approached
at
a
great
rate
john
cried
emily
in
terror
you
never
can
pass
you
will
upset
us
there
is
no
danger
dear
grace
said
the
brother
endeavoring
to
check
his
horses
he
succeeded
in
part
but
not
so
as
to
prevent
his
passing
at
a
spot
where
the
road
was
very
narrow
a
wheel
hit
violently
against
a
stone
and
some
of
his
works
gave
way
the
gentleman
immediately
hastened
to
his
assistance
it
was
denbigh
miss
moseley
cried
he
in
a
voice
of
the
tenderest
interest
you
are
not
hurt
in
the
least
i
hope
no
said
emily
recovering
her
breath
only
frightened
and
taking
his
hand
she
sprang
from
the
carriage
miss
chatterton
found
courage
to
wait
quietly
for
the
care
of
john
his
dear
grace
had
thrilled
on
every
nerve
and
she
afterwards
often
laughed
at
emily
for
her
terror
when
there
was
so
little
danger
the
horses
were
not
in
the
least
frightened
and
after
a
little
mending
john
declared
all
was
safe
to
ask
emily
to
enter
the
carriage
again
was
to
exact
no
little
sacrifice
of
her
feelings
to
her
reason
and
she
stood
in
a
suspense
that
too
plainly
showed
that
the
terror
she
had
been
in
had
not
left
her
if
said
denbigh
modestly
if
moseley
will
take
the
ladies
in
my
gig
i
will
drive
the
phaeton
to
the
hall
as
it
is
rather
unsafe
for
so
heavy
a
load
no
no
denbigh
said
john
coolly
you
are
not
used
to
such
mettled
nags
as
mine
it
would
be
indiscreet
for
you
to
drive
them
if
however
you
will
be
good
enough
to
take
emily
into
your
gig
grace
chatterton
i
am
sure
is
not
afraid
to
trust
my
driving
and
we
might
all
get
back
as
well
as
ever
grace
gave
her
hand
almost
unconsciously
to
john
and
he
handed
her
into
the
phaeton
as
denbigh
stood
willing
to
execute
his
part
of
the
arrangement
but
too
diffident
to
speak
it
was
not
a
moment
for
affectation
if
emily
had
been
capable
of
it
and
blushing
with
the
novelty
of
her
situation
she
took
her
place
in
the
gig
denbigh
stopped
and
turned
his
eyes
on
the
little
group
with
which
he
had
been
talking
and
at
that
moment
they
caught
the
attention
of
john
also
the
latter
inquired
after
their
situation
the
tale
was
a
piteous
one
the
distress
evidently
real
the
husband
had
been
gardener
to
a
gentleman
in
a
neighboring
county
and
he
had
been
lately
discharged
to
make
way
in
the
difficulty
of
the
times
for
a
relation
of
the
steward
who
was
in
want
of
the
place
suddenly
thrown
on
the
world
with
a
wife
and
four
children
with
but
the
wages
of
a
week
for
his
and
their
support
they
had
travelled
thus
far
on
the
way
to
a
neighboring
parish
where
he
said
he
had
a
right
to
and
must
seek
public
assistance
the
children
were
crying
for
hunger
and
the
mother
who
was
a
nurse
had
been
unable
to
walk
further
than
where
she
sat
but
had
sunk
on
the
ground
overcome
with
fatigue
and
weak
from
the
want
of
nourishment
neither
emily
nor
grace
could
refrain
from
tears
at
the
recital
of
these
heavy
woes
the
want
of
sustenance
was
something
so
shocking
in
itself
and
brought
as
it
were
immediately
before
their
eyes
the
appeal
was
irresistible
john
forgot
his
bays
forgot
even
grace
as
he
listened
to
the
affecting
story
related
by
the
woman
who
was
much
revived
by
some
nutriment
denbigh
had
obtained
from
a
cottage
near
them
and
to
which
they
were
about
to
proceed
by
his
directions
as
moseley
interrupted
them
his
hand
shook
his
eyes
glistened
as
he
took
his
purse
from
his
pocket
and
gave
several
guineas
from
it
to
the
mendicant
grace
thought
john
had
never
appeared
so
handsome
as
the
moment
he
handed
the
money
to
the
gardener
his
face
glowed
with
unusual
excitement
and
his
symmetry
had
lost
the
only
charm
he
wanted
in
common
softness
denbigh
after
waiting
patiently
until
moseley
had
bestowed
his
alms
gravely
repeated
his
directions
for
their
proceeding
to
the
cottage
when
the
carriages
moved
on
emily
revolved
in
her
mind
during
their
short
ride
the
horrid
distress
she
had
witnessed
it
had
taken
a
strong
hold
on
her
feelings
like
her
brother
she
was
and
compassionate
if
we
may
use
the
term
to
excess
and
had
she
been
prepared
with
the
means
the
gardener
would
have
reaped
a
double
harvest
of
donations
it
struck
her
at
the
moment
unpleasantly
that
denbigh
had
been
so
backward
in
his
liberality
the
man
had
rather
sullenly
displayed
half
a
crown
as
his
gift
in
contrast
with
the
golden
shower
of
john
generosity
it
had
been
even
somewhat
offensive
in
its
exhibition
and
urged
her
brother
to
a
more
hasty
departure
than
under
other
circumstances
he
would
just
at
the
moment
have
felt
disposed
to
make
denbigh
however
had
taken
no
notice
of
the
indignity
and
continued
his
directions
in
the
same
mild
and
benevolent
manner
he
had
used
during
the
whole
interview
half
a
crown
was
but
little
thought
emily
for
a
family
that
was
starving
and
unwilling
to
judge
harshly
of
one
she
had
begun
to
value
so
highly
she
came
to
the
painful
conclusion
her
companion
was
not
as
rich
as
he
deserved
to
be
emily
had
not
yet
to
learn
that
charity
was
in
proportion
to
the
means
of
the
donor
and
a
gentle
wish
insensibly
stole
over
her
that
denbigh
might
in
some
way
become
more
richly
endowed
with
the
good
things
of
this
world
until
this
moment
her
thoughts
had
never
turned
to
his
temporal
condition
she
knew
he
was
an
officer
in
the
army
but
of
what
rank
or
even
of
what
regiment
she
was
ignorant
he
had
frequently
touched
in
his
conversations
on
the
customs
of
the
different
countries
he
had
seen
he
had
served
in
italy
in
the
north
of
europe
in
the
west
indies
in
spain
of
the
manners
of
the
people
of
their
characters
he
not
unfrequently
spoke
and
with
a
degree
of
intelligence
a
liberality
a
justness
of
discrimination
that
had
charmed
his
auditors
but
on
the
point
of
personal
service
he
had
maintained
a
silence
that
was
inflexible
and
not
a
little
surprising
more
particularly
of
that
part
of
his
history
which
related
to
the
latter
country
from
all
which
she
was
rather
inclined
to
think
his
military
rank
was
not
as
high
as
she
thought
he
merited
and
that
possibly
he
felt
an
awkwardness
of
putting
it
in
contrast
with
the
more
elevated
station
of
colonel
egerton
the
same
idea
had
struck
the
whole
family
and
prevented
any
inquiries
which
might
be
painful
he
was
so
connected
with
the
mournful
event
of
his
father
death
that
no
questions
could
be
put
with
propriety
to
the
doctor
family
and
if
francis
had
been
more
communicative
to
clara
she
was
too
good
a
wife
to
mention
it
and
her
own
family
was
possessed
of
too
just
a
sense
of
propriety
to
touch
upon
points
that
might
bring
her
conjugal
fidelity
in
question
though
denbigh
appeared
a
little
abstracted
during
the
ride
his
questions
concerning
sir
edward
and
her
friends
were
kind
and
affectionate
as
they
approached
the
house
he
suffered
his
horse
to
walk
and
after
some
hesitation
he
took
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
handing
it
to
her
said
i
hope
miss
moseley
will
not
think
me
impertinent
in
becoming
the
bearer
of
a
letter
from
her
cousin
lord
chatterton
he
requested
it
so
earnestly
that
i
could
not
refuse
taking
what
i
am
sensible
is
a
great
liberty
for
it
would
be
deception
did
i
affect
to
be
ignorant
of
his
admiration
or
of
his
generous
treatment
of
a
passion
she
can
not
return
chatterton
and
he
smiled
mournfully
is
yet
too
true
to
cease
his
commendations
emily
blushed
painfully
but
she
took
the
letter
in
silence
and
as
denbigh
pursued
the
topic
no
further
the
little
distance
they
had
to
go
was
ridden
in
silence
on
entering
the
gates
however
he
said
inquiringly
and
with
much
interest
i
sincerely
hope
i
have
not
given
offence
to
your
delicacy
miss
moseley
lord
chatterton
has
made
me
an
unwilling
confidant
i
need
not
say
the
secret
is
sacred
on
more
accounts
than
one
surely
not
denbigh
replied
emily
in
a
low
tone
and
the
gig
stopping
she
hastened
to
accept
the
assistance
of
her
brother
to
alight
well
sister
cried
john
laughing
denbigh
is
a
disciple
to
system
of
hairs
smooth
enough
here
i
see
grace
and
i
thought
you
would
never
get
home
now
john
fibbed
a
little
for
neither
grace
nor
he
had
thought
in
the
least
about
them
or
anything
else
but
each
other
from
the
moment
they
separated
until
the
gig
arrived
emily
made
no
reply
to
this
speech
and
as
the
gentlemen
were
engaged
in
giving
directions
concerning
their
horses
she
seized
an
opportunity
to
read
chatterton
letter
i
avail
myself
of
the
return
of
my
friend
denbigh
to
that
happy
family
from
which
reason
requires
my
to
assure
my
amiable
cousin
of
my
continued
respect
for
her
character
and
to
convince
her
of
my
gratitude
for
the
tenderness
she
has
manifested
to
feelings
she
can
not
return
i
may
even
venture
to
tell
her
what
few
women
would
be
pleased
to
hear
but
what
i
know
emily
moseley
too
well
to
doubt
for
a
moment
will
give
her
unalloyed
pleasure
that
owing
to
the
kind
the
benevolent
the
brotherly
attentions
of
my
true
friend
denbigh
i
have
already
gained
a
peace
of
mind
and
resignation
i
once
thought
was
lost
to
me
for
ever
ah
emily
my
beloved
cousin
in
denbigh
you
will
find
i
doubt
not
a
mind
principles
congenial
to
your
own
it
is
impossible
that
he
could
see
you
without
wishing
to
possess
such
a
treasure
and
if
i
have
a
wish
that
is
now
uppermost
in
my
heart
it
is
that
you
may
learn
to
esteem
each
other
as
you
ought
when
i
doubt
not
you
will
become
as
happy
as
you
both
deserve
to
be
what
greater
earthly
blessing
can
i
implore
upon
you
chatterton
emily
while
reading
this
epistle
felt
a
confusion
but
little
inferior
to
that
which
would
have
oppressed
her
had
denbigh
himself
been
at
her
feet
soliciting
that
love
chatterton
thought
him
so
worthy
of
possessing
and
when
they
met
she
could
hardly
look
in
the
face
a
man
who
it
would
seem
had
been
so
openly
selected
by
another
as
the
fittest
to
be
her
partner
for
life
the
unaltered
manner
of
denbigh
himself
however
soon
convinced
her
that
he
was
entirely
ignorant
of
the
contents
of
the
note
and
it
greatly
relieved
her
from
the
awkwardness
his
presence
at
first
occasioned
francis
soon
returned
accompanied
by
his
wife
and
aunt
and
was
overjoyed
to
find
the
guest
who
had
so
unexpectedly
arrived
his
parents
had
not
yet
returned
from
their
visit
and
denbigh
of
course
would
remain
at
his
present
quarters
john
promised
to
continue
with
them
for
a
couple
of
days
and
everything
was
soon
settled
to
the
perfect
satisfaction
of
the
whole
party
wilson
knew
the
great
danger
of
suffering
young
people
to
be
inmates
of
the
same
house
too
well
wantonly
to
incur
the
penalties
but
her
visit
had
nearly
expired
and
it
might
give
her
a
better
opportunity
of
judging
denbigh
character
and
grace
chatterton
though
too
delicate
to
follow
herself
was
well
contented
to
be
followed
especially
when
john
moseley
was
the
pursuer
chapter
xvi
i
am
sorry
aunt
denbigh
is
not
rich
said
emily
to
wilson
after
they
had
retired
in
the
evening
almost
unconscious
of
what
she
uttered
the
latter
looked
at
her
niece
in
surprise
at
a
remark
so
abrupt
and
one
so
very
different
from
the
ordinary
train
of
reflections
as
she
required
an
explanation
emily
slightly
coloring
at
the
channel
her
thoughts
had
insensibly
strayed
into
gave
her
aunt
an
account
of
their
adventure
in
the
course
of
the
morning
drive
and
touched
lightly
on
the
difference
in
the
amount
of
the
alms
of
her
brother
and
those
of
denbigh
the
bestowal
of
money
is
not
always
an
act
of
charity
observed
wilson
gravely
and
the
subject
was
dropped
though
neither
ceased
to
dwell
on
it
in
her
thoughts
until
sleep
closed
the
eyes
of
both
the
following
day
wilson
invited
grace
and
emily
to
accompany
her
in
a
walk
the
gentlemen
having
preceded
them
in
pursuit
of
their
different
avocations
francis
had
his
regular
visits
of
spiritual
consolation
john
had
gone
to
the
hall
for
his
pointers
and
piece
the
season
for
woodcock
having
arrived
and
denbigh
had
proceeded
no
one
knew
whither
on
gaining
the
wilson
desired
her
companions
to
lead
the
way
to
the
cottage
where
the
family
of
the
mendicant
gardener
had
been
lodged
and
thither
they
soon
arrived
on
knocking
at
the
door
they
were
immediately
admitted
to
an
outer
room
in
which
they
found
the
wife
of
the
laborer
who
inhabited
the
building
engaged
in
her
customary
morning
employments
they
explained
the
motives
of
the
visit
and
were
told
that
the
family
they
sought
were
in
an
adjoining
room
but
she
rather
thought
at
that
moment
engaged
with
a
clergyman
who
had
called
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
i
expect
my
lady
it
the
new
rector
who
everybody
says
is
so
good
to
the
poor
and
needy
but
i
have
not
found
time
yet
to
go
to
church
to
hear
his
reverence
preach
courtseying
and
handing
the
fresh
dusted
chairs
to
her
unexpected
visitors
the
ladies
seated
themselves
too
delicate
to
interrupt
francis
in
his
sacred
duties
and
were
silently
waiting
his
appearance
when
a
voice
was
distinctly
heard
through
the
thin
partition
the
first
note
of
which
undeceived
them
as
to
the
character
of
the
gardener
visitor
it
appears
then
davis
by
your
own
confession
said
denbigh
mildly
but
in
a
tone
of
reproof
that
your
frequent
acts
of
intemperance
have
at
least
given
ground
for
the
steward
procuring
your
discharge
if
it
has
not
justified
him
in
doing
that
which
his
duty
to
your
common
employer
required
it
is
hard
sir
replied
the
man
sullenly
to
be
thrown
on
the
world
with
a
family
like
mine
to
make
way
for
a
younger
man
with
but
one
child
it
may
be
unfortunate
for
your
wife
and
children
said
denbigh
but
just
as
respects
yourself
i
have
already
convinced
you
that
my
interference
or
reproof
is
not
an
empty
one
carry
the
letter
to
the
person
to
whom
it
is
directed
and
i
pledge
you
you
shall
have
a
new
trial
and
should
you
conduct
yourself
soberly
and
with
propriety
continued
and
ample
support
the
second
letter
will
gain
you
children
immediate
admission
to
the
school
i
mentioned
and
i
now
leave
you
with
an
earnest
injunction
to
remember
that
habits
of
intemperance
not
only
disqualify
you
to
support
those
who
have
such
great
claims
on
your
protection
but
inevitably
lead
to
a
loss
of
those
powers
which
are
necessary
to
insure
your
own
eternal
welfare
may
heaven
bless
your
honor
cried
the
woman
with
fervor
and
evidently
in
tears
both
for
what
you
have
said
and
what
you
have
done
thomas
only
wants
to
be
taken
from
temptation
to
become
a
sober
man
again
an
honest
one
he
has
ever
been
i
am
sure
i
have
selected
a
place
for
him
replied
denbigh
where
there
is
no
exposure
through
improper
companions
and
everything
now
depends
upon
himself
under
providence
wilson
had
risen
from
her
chair
on
the
first
intimation
given
by
denbigh
of
his
intention
to
go
but
had
paused
at
the
door
to
listen
to
this
last
speech
when
beckoning
her
companions
she
hastily
withdrew
having
first
made
a
small
present
to
the
woman
of
the
cottage
and
requested
her
not
to
mention
their
having
called
what
becomes
now
of
the
comparative
charity
of
your
brother
and
denbigh
emily
asked
wilson
as
they
gained
the
road
on
their
return
homewards
emily
was
not
accustomed
to
hear
any
act
of
john
slightly
spoken
of
without
at
least
manifesting
some
emotion
which
betrayed
her
sisterly
regard
but
on
the
present
occasion
she
chose
to
be
silent
while
grace
after
waiting
in
expectation
that
her
cousin
would
speak
ventured
to
say
timidly
i
am
sure
dear
madam
moseley
was
very
liberal
and
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
while
he
gave
the
money
i
was
looking
directly
at
them
the
whole
time
john
is
compassionate
by
nature
continued
wilson
with
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
i
have
no
doubt
his
sympathies
were
warmly
enlisted
in
behalf
of
this
family
and
possessing
much
he
gave
liberally
i
have
no
doubt
he
would
have
undergone
personal
privation
to
have
relieved
their
distress
and
endured
both
pain
and
labor
with
such
an
excitement
before
him
but
what
is
all
that
to
the
charity
of
mr
denbigh
grace
was
unused
to
contend
and
least
of
all
with
wilson
but
unwilling
to
abandon
john
to
such
censure
with
increased
animation
she
said
if
bestowing
freely
and
feeling
for
the
distress
you
relieve
be
not
commendable
madam
i
am
sure
i
am
ignorant
what
is
that
compassion
for
the
woes
of
others
is
beautiful
in
itself
and
the
want
of
it
an
invariable
evidence
of
corruption
from
too
much
and
an
intercourse
with
the
world
i
am
willing
to
acknowledge
my
dear
grace
said
wilson
kindly
but
the
relief
of
misery
where
the
heart
has
not
undergone
this
hardening
ordeal
is
only
a
relief
to
our
own
feelings
this
is
compassion
but
christian
charity
is
a
higher
order
of
duty
it
enters
into
every
sensation
of
the
heart
disposes
us
to
judge
as
well
as
to
act
favorably
to
our
fellow
creatures
is
deeply
seated
in
the
sense
of
our
own
unworthiness
keeps
a
single
eye
in
its
dispensations
of
temporal
benefits
to
the
everlasting
happiness
of
the
objects
of
its
bounty
is
consistent
well
regulated
in
short
wilson
pale
cheek
glowed
with
an
unusual
richness
of
color
it
is
an
humble
attempt
to
copy
after
the
heavenly
example
of
our
redeemer
in
sacrificing
ourselves
to
the
welfare
of
others
and
does
and
must
proceed
from
a
love
of
his
person
and
an
obedience
to
his
mandates
and
denbigh
aunt
exclaimed
emily
the
blood
mantling
to
her
cheeks
with
a
sympathetic
glow
while
she
lost
all
consideration
for
john
in
the
strength
of
her
feelings
his
charity
you
think
to
be
of
this
description
so
far
my
child
as
we
can
understand
motives
from
the
nature
of
the
conduct
such
appears
to
have
been
the
charity
of
mr
denbigh
grace
was
silenced
if
not
convinced
and
the
ladies
continued
their
walk
lost
in
their
own
reflections
until
they
reached
a
bend
in
the
road
which
hid
the
cottage
from
view
emily
involuntarily
turned
her
head
as
they
arrived
at
the
spot
and
saw
that
denbigh
had
approached
within
a
few
paces
of
them
on
joining
them
he
commenced
his
complimentary
address
in
such
a
way
as
convinced
them
the
cottager
had
been
true
to
the
injunction
given
by
wilson
no
mention
was
made
of
the
gardener
and
denbigh
began
a
lively
description
of
some
foreign
scenery
of
which
their
present
situation
reminded
him
the
discourse
was
maintained
with
great
interest
by
himself
and
wilson
for
the
remainder
of
their
walk
it
was
yet
early
when
they
reached
the
parsonage
where
they
found
john
who
had
driven
to
the
hall
to
breakfast
and
who
instead
of
pursuing
his
favorite
amusement
of
shooting
laid
down
his
gun
as
they
entered
observing
it
is
rather
soon
yet
for
the
woodcocks
and
i
believe
i
will
listen
to
your
entertaining
conversation
ladies
for
the
remainder
of
the
morning
he
threw
himself
upon
a
sofa
at
no
great
distance
from
grace
and
in
such
a
position
as
enabled
him
without
rudeness
to
study
the
features
of
her
lovely
face
while
denbigh
read
aloud
to
the
ladies
campbell
beautiful
description
of
wedded
love
in
gertrude
of
wyoming
there
was
a
chastened
correctness
in
the
ordinary
manner
of
denbigh
which
wore
the
appearance
of
the
influence
of
his
reason
and
a
subjection
of
the
passions
that
if
anything
gave
him
less
interest
with
emily
than
had
it
been
marked
by
an
evidence
of
stronger
feeling
but
on
the
present
occasion
this
objection
was
removed
his
reading
was
impressive
he
dwelt
on
those
passages
which
most
pleased
him
with
a
warmth
of
eulogium
fully
equal
to
her
own
undisguised
sensations
in
the
hour
occupied
in
the
reading
this
exquisite
little
poem
and
in
commenting
on
its
merits
and
sentiments
denbigh
gained
more
on
her
imagination
than
in
all
their
former
intercourse
his
ideas
were
as
pure
as
chastened
and
almost
as
vivid
as
those
of
the
poet
and
emily
listened
to
his
periods
with
intense
attention
as
they
flowed
from
him
in
language
as
glowing
as
his
ideas
the
poem
had
been
first
read
to
her
by
her
brother
and
she
was
surprised
to
discover
how
she
had
overlooked
its
beauties
on
that
occasion
even
john
acknowledged
that
it
certainly
appeared
a
different
thing
now
from
what
he
had
then
thought
it
but
emily
had
taxed
his
declamatory
power
in
the
height
of
the
pheasant
season
and
somehow
or
other
john
now
imagined
that
gertrude
was
just
such
a
delicate
feminine
domestic
girl
as
grace
chatterton
as
denbigh
closed
the
book
and
entered
into
a
general
conversation
with
clara
and
her
sister
john
followed
grace
to
a
window
and
speaking
in
a
tone
of
unusual
softness
for
him
he
said
do
you
know
miss
chatterton
i
have
accepted
your
brother
invitation
to
go
into
suffolk
this
summer
and
that
you
are
to
be
plagued
with
me
and
my
pointers
again
plagued
mr
moseley
said
grace
in
a
voice
even
softer
than
his
own
i
am
sure
i
am
sure
we
none
of
us
think
you
or
your
dogs
in
the
least
a
plague
ah
grace
and
john
was
about
to
become
what
he
had
never
been
when
he
saw
the
carriage
of
chatterton
containing
the
dowager
and
catherine
entering
the
parsonage
gates
pshaw
thought
john
there
comes
mother
chatterton
ah
grace
said
john
there
are
your
mother
and
sister
returned
already
already
said
the
young
lady
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
rather
unlike
a
dutiful
child
five
minutes
could
have
made
no
great
difference
to
her
mother
and
she
would
greatly
have
liked
to
hear
what
john
moseley
meant
to
have
said
for
the
alteration
in
his
manner
convinced
her
that
his
first
ah
grace
was
to
have
been
continued
in
a
somewhat
different
language
from
that
in
which
the
second
ah
grace
was
ended
young
moseley
and
her
daughter
standing
together
at
the
open
window
caught
the
attention
of
lady
chatterton
the
moment
she
got
a
view
of
the
house
and
she
entered
with
a
good
humor
she
had
not
felt
since
the
disappointment
in
her
late
expedition
in
behalf
of
catherine
for
the
gentleman
she
had
had
in
view
in
this
excursion
had
been
taken
up
by
another
rover
acting
on
her
own
account
and
backed
by
a
little
more
wit
and
a
good
deal
more
money
than
what
kate
could
be
fairly
thought
to
possess
nothing
further
in
that
quarter
offering
in
the
way
of
her
occupation
she
turned
her
horses
heads
towards
london
that
great
theatre
on
which
there
never
was
a
loss
for
actors
the
salutations
had
hardly
passed
before
turning
to
john
she
exclaimed
with
what
she
intended
for
a
most
motherly
smile
what
not
shooting
this
fine
day
moseley
i
thought
you
never
missed
a
day
in
the
season
it
is
rather
early
yet
my
lady
said
john
coolly
a
little
alarmed
by
the
expression
of
her
countenance
oh
continued
the
dowager
in
the
same
strain
i
see
how
it
is
the
ladies
have
too
many
attractions
for
so
gallant
a
young
man
as
yourself
now
as
grace
her
own
daughter
was
the
only
lady
of
the
party
who
could
reasonably
be
supposed
to
have
much
influence
over
john
movements
a
young
gentleman
seldom
caring
as
much
for
his
own
as
for
other
people
sisters
this
may
be
fairly
set
down
as
a
pretty
broad
hint
of
the
opinion
the
dowager
entertained
of
the
real
state
of
things
and
john
saw
it
and
grace
saw
it
the
former
coolly
replied
why
upon
the
whole
if
you
will
excuse
the
neglect
i
will
try
a
shot
this
fine
day
in
five
minutes
carlo
and
rover
were
both
delighted
grace
kept
her
place
at
the
window
from
a
feeling
she
could
not
define
and
of
which
perhaps
she
was
unconscious
until
the
gate
closed
and
the
shrubbery
hid
the
sportsman
from
her
sight
and
then
she
withdrew
to
her
room
to
weep
had
grace
chatterton
been
a
particle
less
delicate
less
retiring
blessed
with
a
managing
mother
as
she
was
john
moseley
would
not
have
thought
another
moment
about
her
but
on
every
occasion
when
the
dowager
made
any
of
her
open
attacks
grace
discovered
so
much
distress
so
much
unwillingness
to
second
them
that
a
suspicion
of
a
confederacy
never
entered
his
brain
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
lady
manoeuvres
were
limited
to
the
direct
and
palpable
schemes
we
have
mentioned
no
these
were
the
effervescence
the
exuberance
of
her
zeal
but
as
is
generally
the
case
they
sufficiently
proved
the
of
all
her
other
machinations
none
of
the
little
artifices
of
such
as
placing
of
leaving
alone
of
showing
similarity
of
tastes
of
compliments
to
the
gentlemen
were
this
latter
business
she
had
contrived
to
get
catherine
to
take
off
her
hands
but
grace
could
never
pay
a
compliment
in
her
life
unless
changing
of
color
trembling
undulations
of
the
bosom
and
such
natural
movements
can
be
so
called
but
she
loved
dearly
to
receive
them
from
john
moseley
well
my
child
said
the
mother
as
she
seated
herself
by
the
side
of
her
daughter
who
hastily
endeavored
to
conceal
her
tears
when
are
we
to
have
another
wedding
i
trust
everything
is
settled
between
you
and
moseley
by
this
time
mother
mother
said
grace
nearly
gasping
for
breath
mother
you
will
break
my
heart
indeed
you
will
she
hid
her
face
in
the
clothes
of
the
bed
by
which
she
sat
and
wept
with
a
feeling
of
despair
tut
my
dear
replied
the
dowager
not
noticing
her
anguish
or
mistaking
it
for
a
girlish
shame
you
young
people
are
fools
in
these
matters
but
sir
edward
and
myself
will
arrange
everything
as
it
should
be
the
daughter
now
not
only
looked
up
but
sprang
from
her
seat
her
hands
clasped
together
her
eyes
fixed
in
horror
her
cheek
pale
as
death
but
the
mother
had
retired
and
grace
sank
back
into
her
chair
with
a
sensation
of
disgrace
of
despair
which
could
not
have
been
surpassed
had
she
really
merited
the
obloquy
and
shame
which
she
thought
were
about
to
be
heaped
upon
her
chapter
xvii
the
succeeding
morning
the
whole
party
with
the
exception
of
denbigh
returned
to
the
hall
nothing
had
occurred
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
the
colonel
assiduities
and
jane
whose
sense
of
propriety
forbad
the
indulgence
of
premeditated
and
such
little
accompaniments
of
attachments
was
rejoiced
to
see
a
sister
she
loved
and
an
aunt
she
respected
once
more
in
the
bosom
of
her
family
the
dowager
impatiently
waited
an
opportunity
to
effect
what
she
intended
for
a
of
policy
in
the
disposal
of
grace
like
all
other
managers
she
thought
no
one
equal
to
herself
in
devising
ways
and
means
and
was
unwilling
to
leave
anything
to
nature
grace
had
invariably
thwarted
all
her
schemes
by
her
obstinacy
and
as
she
thought
young
moseley
really
attached
to
her
she
determined
by
a
bold
stroke
to
remove
the
impediments
of
false
shame
and
the
dread
of
repulse
which
she
believed
alone
kept
the
youth
from
an
avowal
of
his
wishes
and
get
rid
at
once
of
a
plague
that
had
annoyed
her
not
a
little
her
daughter
delicacy
sir
edward
spent
an
hour
every
morning
in
his
library
overlooking
his
accounts
and
in
other
necessary
employments
of
a
similar
nature
and
it
was
here
she
determined
to
have
the
conference
my
lady
chatterton
you
do
me
honor
said
the
baronet
handing
her
a
chair
on
her
entrance
upon
my
word
cousin
cried
the
dowager
you
have
a
very
convenient
apartment
here
looking
around
her
in
affected
admiration
of
all
she
saw
the
baronet
replied
and
a
short
discourse
on
the
arrangements
of
the
whole
house
insensibly
led
to
some
remarks
on
the
taste
of
his
mother
the
honorable
lady
moseley
a
chatterton
until
having
warmed
the
feelings
of
the
old
gentleman
by
some
compliments
of
that
nature
she
ventured
on
the
principal
object
of
her
visit
i
am
happy
to
find
sir
edward
you
are
so
well
pleased
with
the
family
as
to
wish
to
make
another
selection
from
it
i
sincerely
hope
it
may
prove
as
judicious
as
the
former
one
sir
edward
was
a
little
at
a
loss
to
understand
her
meaning
although
he
thought
it
might
allude
to
his
son
who
he
had
some
time
suspected
had
views
on
grace
chatterton
and
willing
to
know
the
truth
and
rather
pleased
to
find
john
had
selected
a
young
woman
he
loved
in
his
heart
he
observed
i
am
not
sure
i
rightly
understand
your
ladyship
though
i
hope
i
do
no
cried
the
dowager
in
affectation
of
surprise
perhaps
after
all
maternal
anxiety
has
deceived
me
then
moseley
could
hardly
have
ventured
to
proceed
without
your
approbation
i
have
ever
declined
influencing
any
of
my
children
lady
chatterton
said
the
baronet
and
john
is
not
ignorant
of
my
sentiments
i
sincerely
hope
however
you
allude
to
an
attachment
to
grace
i
did
certainly
sir
edward
said
the
lady
hesitatingly
i
may
be
deceived
but
you
must
understand
the
feelings
of
a
mother
and
a
young
woman
ought
not
to
be
trifled
with
my
son
is
incapable
of
trifling
i
hope
cried
sir
edward
with
animation
and
least
of
all
with
grace
chatterton
no
you
are
quite
right
if
he
has
made
his
choice
he
should
not
be
ashamed
to
avow
it
i
would
not
wish
on
any
account
to
hurry
matters
said
the
dowager
but
the
report
which
is
abroad
will
prevent
other
young
men
from
putting
in
their
claims
sir
edward
sighing
i
have
a
feelings
if
i
have
been
hasty
your
goodness
will
overlook
it
and
lady
chatterton
placed
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
to
conceal
the
tears
that
did
not
flow
sir
edward
thought
all
this
very
natural
and
as
it
should
be
and
he
sought
an
early
conference
with
his
son
john
said
the
father
taking
his
hand
kindly
you
have
no
reason
to
doubt
my
affection
or
my
compliance
to
your
wishes
fortune
is
a
thing
out
of
the
question
with
a
young
man
of
your
expectations
and
sir
edward
in
his
eagerness
to
smoothe
the
way
went
on
you
can
live
here
or
occupy
my
small
seat
in
wiltshire
i
can
allow
you
five
thousand
a
year
with
much
ease
to
myself
indeed
your
mother
and
myself
would
both
straighten
ourselves
to
add
to
your
comforts
but
it
is
unnecessary
we
have
enough
and
you
have
enough
sir
edward
in
a
few
moments
would
have
settled
everything
to
the
dowager
perfect
satisfaction
had
not
john
interrupted
him
by
the
exclamation
of
to
what
do
you
allude
father
allude
said
sir
edward
simply
why
grace
chatterton
my
son
grace
chatterton
sir
edward
what
have
i
to
do
with
grace
chatterton
her
mother
has
made
me
acquainted
with
your
proposals
and
proposals
attentions
i
ought
to
have
said
and
you
have
no
reason
to
apprehend
anything
from
me
my
child
attentions
said
john
haughtily
i
hope
lady
chatterton
does
not
accuse
me
of
improper
attentions
to
her
daughter
no
not
improper
my
son
said
his
father
on
the
contrary
she
is
much
pleased
with
them
she
is
is
she
but
i
am
displeased
that
she
should
undertake
to
put
constructions
on
my
acts
that
no
attention
or
words
of
mine
will
justify
it
was
now
sir
edward
turn
to
be
surprised
he
had
thought
he
was
doing
his
son
a
kindness
when
he
had
only
been
forwarding
the
schemes
but
averse
from
contention
and
wondering
at
his
mistake
which
he
at
once
attributed
to
her
anxiety
in
behalf
of
a
favorite
daughter
he
told
john
he
was
sorry
there
had
been
any
misapprehension
and
left
him
no
no
said
moseley
internally
as
he
paced
up
and
down
his
library
my
lady
dowager
you
are
not
going
to
force
a
wife
down
my
throat
if
you
do
i
am
mistaken
and
grace
if
grace
john
softened
and
began
to
feel
unhappy
a
little
but
anger
prevailed
from
the
moment
grace
chatterton
conceived
a
dread
of
her
saying
anything
to
sir
edward
her
whole
conduct
was
altered
she
could
hardly
look
any
of
the
family
in
the
face
and
it
was
her
most
ardent
wish
that
they
might
depart
john
she
avoided
as
she
would
an
adder
although
it
nearly
broke
her
heart
to
do
so
benfield
had
stayed
longer
than
usual
and
he
now
wished
to
return
john
moseley
eagerly
profited
by
this
opportunity
and
the
very
day
after
the
conversation
in
the
library
he
went
to
benfield
lodge
as
a
dutiful
nephew
to
see
his
venerable
uncle
safely
restored
once
more
to
the
abode
of
his
ancestors
lady
chatterton
now
perceived
when
too
late
that
she
had
overshot
her
mark
while
at
the
same
time
she
wondered
at
the
reason
of
a
result
so
strange
from
such
and
plans
she
determined
however
never
again
to
interfere
between
her
daughter
and
the
baronet
heir
concluding
with
a
nearer
approach
to
the
truth
than
always
accompanied
her
deductions
that
they
resembled
ordinary
lovers
in
neither
their
temperaments
nor
opinions
perceiving
no
further
use
in
remaining
any
longer
at
the
hall
she
took
her
leave
and
accompanied
by
both
her
daughters
proceeded
to
the
capital
where
she
expected
to
meet
her
son
ives
and
his
wife
returned
to
the
rectory
on
the
same
day
and
denbigh
immediately
resumed
his
abode
under
their
roof
the
intercourse
between
the
rector
family
and
sir
edward
was
renewed
with
all
its
former
friendly
confidence
colonel
egerton
began
to
speak
of
his
departure
also
but
hinted
at
intentions
of
visiting
l
at
the
period
of
the
baronet
visit
to
his
uncle
before
he
proceeded
to
town
in
the
winter
l
was
a
small
village
on
the
coast
within
a
mile
of
benfield
lodge
and
from
its
natural
convenience
it
had
long
been
resorted
to
by
the
neighboring
gentry
for
the
benefit
of
sea
bathing
the
baronet
had
promised
benfield
his
visit
should
be
made
at
an
earlier
day
than
usual
in
order
to
gratify
jane
with
a
visit
to
bath
before
they
went
to
london
at
which
town
they
were
promised
by
jarvis
the
pleasure
of
her
society
and
that
of
her
son
and
daughters
precaution
is
a
word
of
simple
meaning
in
itself
but
various
are
the
ways
adopted
by
different
individuals
in
this
life
to
enforce
its
import
and
not
a
few
are
the
evils
which
it
is
thought
necessary
to
guard
against
to
provide
in
season
against
the
dangers
of
want
personal
injury
loss
of
character
and
a
great
many
other
such
acknowledged
misfortunes
has
become
a
kind
of
instinctive
process
of
our
natures
the
few
exceptions
which
exist
only
go
to
prove
the
rule
in
addition
to
these
almost
every
man
has
some
ruling
propensity
to
gratify
to
advance
which
his
ingenuity
is
ever
on
the
alert
or
some
apprehended
evil
to
avert
which
calls
all
his
prudence
into
activity
yet
how
seldom
is
it
exerted
in
order
to
give
a
rational
ground
to
expect
permanent
happiness
in
wedlock
marriage
is
called
a
lottery
and
it
is
thought
like
all
other
lotteries
there
are
more
blanks
than
prizes
yet
is
it
not
made
more
precarious
than
it
ought
to
be
by
our
neglect
of
that
degree
of
precaution
which
we
would
be
ridiculed
for
omitting
in
conducting
our
concerns
is
not
the
standard
of
matrimonial
felicity
placed
too
low
ought
we
not
to
look
more
to
the
possession
of
principles
than
to
the
possession
of
wealth
or
is
it
at
all
justifiable
in
a
christian
to
commit
a
child
a
daughter
to
the
keeping
of
a
man
who
wants
the
very
essential
they
acknowledge
most
necessary
to
constitute
a
perfect
character
most
men
revolt
at
infidelity
in
a
woman
and
most
men
however
licentious
themselves
look
for
at
least
the
exterior
of
religion
in
their
wives
the
education
of
their
children
is
a
serious
responsibility
and
although
seldom
conducted
on
such
rules
as
will
stand
the
test
of
reason
it
is
not
to

chapter
xviii
john
moseley
returned
from
l
within
a
week
and
appeared
as
if
his
whole
delight
consisted
in
knocking
over
the
inoffensive
birds
his
restlessness
induced
him
to
make
jarvis
his
companion
for
although
he
abhorred
the
captain
style
of
pursuing
the
sport
being
in
his
opinion
both
out
of
rule
and
without
taste
yet
he
was
a
constitutional
fidget
and
suited
his
own
moving
propensities
at
the
moment
egerton
and
denbigh
were
both
frequently
at
the
hall
but
generally
gave
their
time
to
the
ladies
neither
being
much
inclined
to
the
favorite
amusement
of
john
there
was
a
little
arbor
within
the
walls
of
the
park
which
for
years
had
been
a
retreat
from
the
summer
heats
to
the
ladies
of
the
moseley
family
even
so
long
as
the
youth
of
wilson
it
had
been
in
vogue
and
she
loved
it
with
a
kind
of
melancholy
pleasure
as
the
spot
where
she
had
first
listened
to
the
language
of
love
from
the
lips
of
her
late
husband
into
this
arbor
the
ladies
had
one
day
retired
during
the
warmth
of
a
sun
with
the
exception
of
lady
moseley
who
had
her
own
engagement
in
the
house
between
egerton
and
denbigh
there
was
maintained
a
kind
of
courtly
intercourse
which
prevented
any
disagreeable
collision
from
their
evident
dislike
wilson
thought
on
the
part
of
denbigh
it
was
the
forbearance
of
a
principled
indulgence
to
another
weakness
while
the
colonel
otherwise
uniform
good
breeding
was
hardly
able
to
conceal
a
something
amounting
to
very
near
repugnance
egerton
had
taken
his
seat
on
the
ground
near
the
feet
of
jane
and
denbigh
was
stationed
on
a
bench
placed
without
the
arbor
but
so
near
as
to
have
the
full
benefit
of
the
shade
of
the
noble
oak
branches
of
which
had
been
trained
so
as
to
compose
its
principal
covering
it
might
have
been
accident
that
gave
each
his
particular
situation
but
it
is
certain
they
were
so
placed
as
not
to
be
in
sight
of
each
other
and
so
placed
that
the
colonel
was
ready
to
hand
jane
her
scissors
or
any
other
little
implement
that
she
occasionally
dropped
and
that
denbigh
could
read
every
lineament
of
the
animated
countenance
of
emily
as
she
listened
to
his
description
of
the
curiosities
of
egypt
a
country
in
which
he
had
spent
a
few
months
while
attached
to
the
army
in
sicily
in
this
situation
we
will
leave
them
for
an
hour
happy
in
the
society
of
each
other
while
we
trace
the
route
of
john
moseley
and
his
companion
in
their
pursuit
of
woodcock
on
the
same
day
do
you
know
moseley
said
jarvis
who
began
to
think
he
was
a
favorite
with
john
now
that
he
was
admitted
to
his
menus
plaisirs
that
i
have
taken
it
into
my
head
this
denbigh
was
very
happy
to
plead
his
morals
for
not
meeting
me
he
is
a
soldier
but
i
can
not
find
out
what
battles
he
has
been
in
captain
jarvis
said
john
coolly
the
less
you
say
about
that
business
the
better
call
in
rover
now
another
of
jarvis
recommendations
was
a
set
of
lungs
that
might
have
been
heard
half
a
mile
with
great
ease
on
a
still
morning
why
said
jarvis
rather
humbly
i
am
sensible
mr
moseley
i
was
very
wrong
as
regards
your
sister
but
do
you
think
it
a
little
odd
in
a
soldier
not
to
fight
when
properly
called
upon
i
suppose
denbigh
did
not
think
himself
properly
called
upon
or
perhaps
he
had
heard
what
a
great
shot
you
were
six
months
before
his
appearance
in
b
captain
jarvis
had
been
a
clerk
in
the
of
jarvis
baxter
and
had
never
held
of
any
kind
in
his
hand
with
the
exception
of
an
old
blunderbuss
which
had
been
a
kind
of
sentinel
over
the
iron
chest
for
years
on
mounting
the
cockade
he
had
taken
up
shooting
as
a
martial
exercise
inasmuch
as
the
burning
of
gunpowder
was
an
attendant
of
the
recreation
he
had
never
killed
but
one
bird
in
his
life
and
that
was
an
owl
of
which
he
took
the
advantage
of
daylight
and
his
stocking
feet
to
knock
off
a
tree
in
the
deanery
grounds
very
early
after
his
arrival
in
his
trials
with
john
he
sometimes
pulled
trigger
at
the
same
moment
with
his
companion
and
as
the
bird
generally
fell
he
thought
he
had
an
equal
claim
to
the
honor
he
was
fond
of
warring
with
crows
and
birds
of
the
larger
sort
and
invariably
went
provided
with
small
balls
fitted
to
the
bore
of
his
for
such
accidental
rencontres
he
had
another
habit
which
was
not
a
little
annoying
to
john
who
had
several
times
tried
in
vain
to
break
him
of
it
that
of
shooting
at
marks
if
birds
were
not
plenty
he
would
throw
up
a
chip
and
sometimes
his
hat
by
way
of
shooting
on
the
wing
as
the
day
was
excessively
hot
and
the
game
kept
close
john
felt
willing
to
return
from
such
unprofitable
labor
the
captain
now
commenced
his
chip
firing
which
in
a
few
minutes
was
succeeded
by
his
hat
see
moseley
see
i
have
hit
the
band
cried
the
captain
delighted
to
find
he
had
at
last
wounded
his
old
antagonist
i
do
think
you
can
beat
that
yourself
i
am
not
sure
i
can
said
john
slipping
a
handful
of
gravel
in
the
muzzle
of
his
piece
slily
but
i
can
do
as
you
did
try
do
cried
the
captain
pleased
to
get
his
companion
down
to
his
own
level
of
amusements
are
you
ready
yes
throw
jarvis
threw
and
john
fired
the
hat
fairly
bounced
have
i
hit
it
asked
john
while
reloading
the
barrel
he
had
discharged
hit
it
said
the
captain
looking
ruefully
at
his
hat
it
looks
like
a
cullender
but
moseley
your
gun
do
scatter
well
a
dozen
shot
have
gone
through
in
the
same
place
it
does
look
rather
like
a
cullender
said
john
as
he
overlooked
his
companion
beaver
and
by
the
size
of
some
of
the
holes
one
that
has
been
a
good
deal
used
the
reports
of
the
announced
to
the
party
in
the
arbor
the
return
of
the
sportsmen
it
being
an
invariable
practice
with
john
moseley
to
discharge
his
gun
before
he
came
in
and
jarvis
had
imitated
him
from
a
wish
to
be
what
he
called
in
rule
denbigh
said
john
as
he
put
down
his
gun
captain
jarvis
has
got
the
better
of
his
hat
at
last
denbigh
smiled
without
speaking
and
the
captain
unwilling
to
have
anything
to
say
to
a
gentleman
to
whom
be
had
been
obliged
to
apologize
went
into
the
arbor
to
show
the
mangled
condition
of
his
to
the
colonel
on
whose
sympathies
he
felt
a
kind
of
claim
being
of
the
same
corps
john
complained
of
thirst
and
went
to
a
little
run
of
water
but
a
short
distance
from
them
in
order
to
satisfy
it
the
interruption
of
jarvis
was
particularly
unseasonable
jane
was
relating
in
a
manner
peculiar
to
herself
in
which
was
mingled
that
undefinable
exchange
of
looks
lovers
are
so
fond
of
some
incident
of
her
early
life
to
the
colonel
that
greatly
interested
him
knowing
the
captain
foibles
he
pointed
therefore
with
his
finger
as
he
said
there
is
one
of
your
old
enemies
a
hawk
jarvis
threw
down
his
hat
and
ran
with
boyish
eagerness
to
drive
away
the
intruder
in
his
haste
he
caught
up
the
gun
of
john
moseley
and
loading
it
in
a
ball
from
his
usual
stock
but
whether
the
hawk
saw
and
knew
him
or
whether
it
saw
something
else
it
liked
better
it
made
a
dart
for
the
baronet
at
no
great
distance
and
was
out
of
sight
in
a
minute
seeing
that
his
foe
had
vanished
the
captain
laid
the
piece
where
he
had
found
it
and
recovering
his
old
train
of
ideas
picked
up
his
hat
again
john
said
emily
as
she
approached
him
affectionately
you
were
too
warm
to
drink
stand
off
sis
cried
john
playfully
taking
up
the
gun
from
against
the
body
of
the
tree
and
dropping
it
towards
her
jarvis
had
endeavored
to
make
an
appeal
to
the
commiseration
of
emily
in
favor
of
the
neglected
beaver
and
was
within
a
few
feet
of
them
at
this
moment
recoiling
from
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
he
exclaimed
it
is
loaded
hold
cried
denbigh
in
a
voice
of
horror
as
he
sprang
between
john
and
his
sister
both
were
too
late
the
piece
was
discharged
denbigh
turning
to
emily
and
smiling
mournfully
gazed
for
a
moment
at
her
with
an
expression
of
tenderness
of
pleasure
of
sorrow
so
blended
that
she
retained
the
recollection
of
it
for
life
and
fell
at
her
feet
the
gun
dropped
from
the
nerveless
grasp
of
young
moseley
emily
sank
in
insensibility
by
the
side
of
her
preserver
wilson
and
jane
stood
speechless
and
aghast
the
colonel
alone
retained
the
presence
of
mind
necessary
to
devise
the
steps
to
be
immediately
taken
he
sprang
to
the
examination
of
denbigh
the
eyes
of
the
wounded
man
were
open
and
his
recollection
perfect
the
first
were
fixed
in
intense
observation
on
the
inanimate
body
which
lay
at
his
side
leave
me
colonel
egerton
he
said
speaking
with
difficulty
and
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
little
run
of
water
assist
miss
moseley
your
hat
your
hat
will
answer
accustomed
to
scenes
of
blood
and
not
ignorant
that
time
and
care
were
the
remedies
to
be
applied
to
the
wounded
man
egerton
flew
to
the
stream
and
returning
immediately
by
the
help
of
her
sister
and
wilson
soon
restored
emily
to
life
the
ladies
and
john
had
now
begun
to
act
the
tenderest
assiduities
of
jane
were
devoted
to
her
sister
while
wilson
observing
her
niece
to
be
uninjured
by
anything
but
the
shock
assisted
john
in
supporting
the
wounded
man
denbigh
spoke
requesting
to
be
carried
to
the
house
and
jarvis
was
despatched
for
help
within
half
an
hour
denbigh
was
placed
on
a
couch
in
the
house
of
sir
edward
and
was
quietly
waiting
for
that
professional
aid
which
could
only
decide
on
his
probable
fate
the
group
assembled
in
the
room
were
in
fearful
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
the
surgeons
in
pursuit
of
whom
messengers
had
been
sent
both
to
the
barracks
in
f
and
to
the
town
itself
sir
edward
sat
by
the
side
of
the
sufferer
holding
one
of
his
hands
in
his
own
now
turning
his
tearful
eyes
on
that
daughter
who
had
so
lately
been
rescued
as
it
were
from
the
certainty
of
death
in
mute
gratitude
and
thanksgiving
and
now
dwelling
on
the
countenance
of
him
who
by
bravely
interposing
his
bosom
to
the
blow
had
incurred
in
his
own
person
the
imminent
danger
of
a
similar
fate
with
a
painful
sense
of
his
perilous
situation
and
devout
and
earnest
prayers
for
his
safety
emily
was
with
her
father
as
with
the
rest
of
his
family
a
decided
favorite
and
no
reward
would
have
been
sufficient
no
gratitude
lively
enough
in
the
estimation
of
the
baronet
to
compensate
the
protector
of
such
a
child
she
sat
between
her
mother
and
jane
with
a
hand
held
by
each
pale
and
oppressed
with
a
load
of
gratitude
of
thanksgiving
of
woe
that
almost
bowed
her
to
the
earth
lady
moseley
and
jane
were
both
sensibly
touched
with
the
deliverance
of
emily
and
manifested
the
interest
they
took
in
her
by
the
tenderest
caresses
while
wilson
sat
calmly
collected
within
herself
occasionally
giving
those
few
directions
which
were
necessary
under
the
circumstances
and
offering
up
her
silent
petitions
in
behalf
of
the
sufferer
john
had
taken
horse
immediately
for
f
and
jarvis
had
volunteered
to
go
to
the
rectory
and
bolton
denbigh
inquired
frequently
and
with
much
anxiety
for
ives
but
the
rector
was
absent
from
home
on
a
visit
to
a
sick
parishioner
and
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before
he
arrived
within
three
hours
of
the
accident
however
black
the
surgeon
of
the
th
reached
the
hall
and
immediately
proceeded
to
examine
the
wound
the
ball
had
penetrated
the
right
breast
and
gone
directly
through
the
body
it
was
extracted
with
very
little
difficulty
and
his
attendant
acquainted
the
anxious
friends
of
denbigh
that
the
heart
certainly
and
he
hoped
the
lungs
had
escaped
uninjured
the
ball
was
a
very
small
one
and
the
principal
danger
to
be
apprehended
was
from
fever
he
had
taken
the
usual
precautions
against
that
and
should
it
not
set
in
with
a
violence
greater
than
he
apprehended
at
present
the
patient
might
be
abroad
within
the
month
but
continued
the
surgeon
with
the
hardened
indifference
of
his
profession
the
gentleman
has
had
a
narrow
chance
in
the
passage
of
the
ball
itself
half
an
inch
would
have
settled
his
accounts
with
this
world
this
information
greatly
relieved
the
family
and
orders
were
given
to
preserve
a
silence
in
the
house
that
would
favor
the
disposition
to
quiet
or
if
possible
sleep
ives
now
reached
the
hall
wilson
had
never
seen
the
rector
in
the
agitation
or
with
the
want
of
he
was
in
as
she
met
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
house
is
he
alive
is
there
hope
where
is
george
cried
the
doctor
as
he
caught
the
extended
hand
of
wilson
she
briefly
acquainted
him
with
the
surgeon
report
and
the
reasonable
ground
there
was
to
expect
denbigh
would
survive
the
injury
may
god
be
praised
said
the
rector
in
a
suppressed
voice
and
he
hastily
withdrew
into
another
room
wilson
followed
him
slowly
and
in
silence
but
was
checked
on
opening
the
door
with
the
sight
of
the
rector
on
his
knees
the
tears
stealing
down
his
venerable
cheeks
in
quick
succession
surely
thought
the
widow
as
she
drew
back
unnoticed
a
youth
capable
of
exciting
such
affection
in
a
man
like
ives
can
not
be
unworthy
denbigh
hearing
of
the
arrival
of
his
friend
desired
to
see
him
alone
their
conference
was
short
and
the
rector
returned
from
it
with
increased
hopes
of
the
termination
of
this
dreadful
accident
he
immediately
left
the
hall
for
his
own
house
with
a
promise
of
returning
early
on
the
following
morning
during
the
night
however
the
symptoms
became
unfavorable
and
before
the
return
of
ives
denbigh
was
in
a
state
of
delirium
from
the
height
of
his
fever
and
the
apprehensions
of
his
friends
were
renewed
with
additional
force
what
what
my
good
sir
do
you
think
of
him
said
the
baronet
to
the
family
physician
with
an
emotion
that
the
danger
of
his
dearest
child
would
not
have
exceeded
and
within
hearing
of
most
of
his
children
who
were
collected
in
the
of
the
room
in
which
denbigh
was
placed
it
is
impossible
to
say
sir
edward
replied
the
physician
he
refuses
all
medicines
and
unless
this
fever
abates
there
is
but
little
hope
of
recovery
emily
stood
during
this
question
and
answer
motionless
pale
as
death
and
with
her
hands
clasped
together
betraying
by
the
workings
of
her
fingers
in
a
kind
of
convulsive
motion
the
intensity
of
her
interest
she
had
seen
the
draught
prepared
which
it
was
so
desirable
that
denbigh
should
take
and
it
now
stood
rejected
on
a
table
where
it
could
be
seen
through
the
open
door
of
his
room
almost
breathless
she
glided
in
and
taking
the
draught
in
her
hand
she
approached
the
bed
by
which
sat
john
alone
listening
with
a
feeling
of
despair
to
the
wanderings
of
the
sick
man
emily
hesitated
once
or
twice
as
she
drew
near
denbigh
her
face
had
lost
the
paleness
of
anxiety
and
glowed
with
another
emotion
denbigh
dear
denbigh
said
emily
with
energy
unconsciously
dropping
her
voice
into
the
softest
notes
of
persuasion
will
you
refuse
me
me
emily
moseley
whose
life
you
have
saved
emily
moseley
repeated
denbigh
and
in
those
tones
so
remarkable
to
his
natural
voice
is
she
safe
i
thought
she
was
killed
dead
then
as
if
recollecting
himself
he
gazed
intently
on
her
countenance
his
eye
became
less
fiery
his
muscles
relaxed
he
smiled
and
took
with
the
docility
of
a
child
the
prescribed
medicines
from
her
hand
his
ideas
still
wandered
but
his
physician
profiting
by
the
command
emily
possessed
over
his
patient
increased
his
care
and
by
night
the
fever
had
abated
and
before
morning
the
wounded
man
was
in
a
profound
sleep
during
the
whole
day
it
was
thought
necessary
to
keep
emily
by
the
side
of
his
bed
but
at
times
it
was
no
trifling
tax
on
her
feelings
to
remain
there
he
spoke
of
her
by
name
in
the
tenderest
manner
although
incoherently
and
in
terms
that
restored
to
the
blanched
cheeks
of
the
distressed
girl
more
than
the
richness
of
their
native
color
his
thoughts
were
not
confined
to
emily
however
he
talked
of
his
father
of
his
mother
and
frequently
spoke
of
his
poor
deserted
marian
the
latter
name
he
dwelt
on
in
the
language
of
the
warmest
affection
condemned
his
own
desertion
of
her
and
taking
emily
for
her
would
beg
her
forgiveness
tell
her
her
sufferings
had
been
enough
and
that
he
would
return
and
never
leave
her
again
at
such
moments
his
nurse
would
sometimes
show
by
the
paleness
of
her
cheeks
her
anxiety
for
his
health
and
then
as
he
addressed
her
by
her
proper
appellation
all
her
emotions
appeared
absorbed
in
the
sense
of
shame
at
the
praises
with
which
he
overwhelmed
her
wilson
succeeded
her
in
the
charge
of
the
patient
and
she
retired
to
seek
that
repose
she
so
greatly
needed
on
the
second
morning
after
receiving
the
wound
denbigh
dropped
into
a
deep
sleep
from
which
he
awoke
refreshed
and
perfectly
collected
in
mind
the
fever
had
left
him
and
his
attendants
pronounced
with
the
usual
cautions
to
prevent
a
relapse
his
recovery
certain
it
were
impossible
to
have
communicated
any
intelligence
more
grateful
to
all
the
members
of
the
moseley
family
for
jane
had
even
lost
sight
of
her
own
lover
in
sympathy
for
the
fate
of
a
man
who
had
sacrificed
himself
to
save
her
beloved
sister
chapter
xix
the
recovery
of
denbigh
was
as
rapid
as
the
most
sanguine
expectation
of
his
friends
could
hope
for
and
in
ten
days
he
left
his
bed
and
would
sit
an
hour
or
two
at
a
time
in
his
where
wilson
accompanied
by
jane
or
emily
came
and
read
to
him
and
it
was
a
remark
of
sir
edward
gamekeeper
that
the
woodcocks
had
become
so
tame
during
the
time
moseley
was
shut
up
in
attendance
on
his
friend
that
captain
jarvis
was
at
last
actually
seen
to
bag
one
honestly
as
jarvis
felt
something
like
a
consciousness
that
but
for
his
folly
the
accident
would
not
have
happened
and
also
something
very
like
shame
for
the
manner
he
had
shrunk
from
the
danger
denbigh
had
so
nobly
met
he
pretended
a
recall
to
his
regiment
then
on
duty
near
london
and
left
the
deanery
he
went
off
as
he
came
in
in
the
colonel
tilbury
and
accompanied
by
his
friend
and
his
pointers
john
who
saw
them
pass
from
the
windows
of
denbigh
fervently
prayed
he
might
never
come
back
again
the
poacher
colonel
egerton
had
taken
leave
of
jane
the
evening
preceding
with
many
assurances
of
the
anxiety
with
which
he
should
look
forward
to
the
moment
of
their
meeting
at
l
whither
he
intended
repairing
as
soon
as
his
corps
had
gone
through
its
annual
review
jane
had
followed
the
bent
of
her
natural
feelings
too
much
during
the
period
of
uncertain
fate
to
think
much
of
her
lover
or
anything
else
but
her
rescued
sister
and
her
preserver
but
now
the
former
was
pronounced
in
safety
and
the
latter
by
the
very
reaction
of
her
grief
was
if
possible
happier
than
ever
jane
dwelt
in
melancholy
sadness
on
the
perfections
of
the
man
who
had
taken
with
him
the
best
affections
as
she
thought
of
her
heart
with
him
all
was
perfect
his
morals
were
unexceptionable
his
manners
showed
it
his
tenderness
of
disposition
manifest
for
they
had
wept
together
over
the
distresses
of
more
than
one
fictitious
heroine
his
temper
how
amiable
he
was
never
angry
she
had
never
seen
it
his
opinions
his
tastes
how
correct
they
were
her
own
his
form
his
face
how
agreeable
her
eyes
had
seen
it
and
her
heart
acknowledged
it
besides
his
eyes
confessed
the
power
of
her
own
charms
he
was
brave
for
he
was
a
soldier
in
short
as
emily
had
predicted
he
was
a
hero
for
he
was
colonel
egerton
had
jane
been
possessed
of
less
exuberance
of
fancy
she
might
have
been
a
little
at
a
loss
to
identify
all
these
good
properties
with
her
hero
or
had
she
possessed
a
matured
or
judgment
to
control
that
fancy
they
might
possibly
have
assumed
a
different
appearance
no
explanation
had
taken
place
between
them
however
jane
knew
both
by
her
own
feelings
and
by
all
the
legends
of
love
from
its
earliest
days
that
the
moment
of
parting
was
generally
a
crisis
in
affairs
of
the
heart
and
with
a
backwardness
occasioned
by
her
modesty
had
rather
avoided
than
sought
an
opportunity
to
favor
the
colonel
wishes
egerton
had
not
been
over
anxious
to
come
to
the
point
and
everything
was
left
as
heretofore
neither
however
appeared
to
doubt
in
the
least
the
state
of
the
other
affections
and
there
might
be
said
to
exist
between
them
one
of
those
not
unusual
engagements
by
implication
which
it
would
have
been
in
their
own
estimation
a
breach
of
faith
to
recede
from
but
which
like
all
other
bargains
that
are
loosely
made
are
sometimes
violated
when
convenient
man
is
a
creature
that
as
experience
has
sufficiently
proved
it
is
necessary
to
keep
in
his
proper
place
in
society
by
wholesome
restrictions
and
we
have
often
thought
it
a
matter
of
regret
that
some
well
understood
regulations
did
not
exist
by
which
it
became
not
only
customary
but
incumbent
on
him
to
proceed
in
his
road
to
the
temple
of
hymen
we
know
that
it
is
ungenerous
ignoble
almost
unprecedented
to
doubt
the
faith
the
constancy
of
a
male
paragon
yet
somehow
as
the
papers
occasionally
give
us
a
sample
of
such
infidelity
as
we
have
sometimes
seen
a
solitary
female
brooding
over
her
woes
in
silence
and
with
the
seemliness
of
feminine
decorum
shrinking
from
the
discovery
of
its
cause
or
which
the
grave
has
revealed
for
the
first
time
we
can
not
but
wish
that
either
the
watchfulness
of
the
parent
or
a
sense
of
preservation
in
the
daughter
would
for
the
want
of
a
better
cause
them
to
adhere
to
those
old
conventional
forms
of
courtship
which
require
a
man
to
speak
to
be
understood
and
a
woman
to
answer
to
be
committed
there
was
a
little
parlor
in
the
house
of
sir
edward
moseley
that
was
the
privileged
retreat
of
none
but
the
members
of
his
own
family
here
the
ladies
were
accustomed
to
withdraw
into
the
bosom
of
their
domestic
quietude
when
occasional
visitors
had
disturbed
their
ordinary
intercourse
and
many
were
the
hasty
and
unreserved
communications
it
had
witnessed
between
the
sisters
in
their
stolen
flights
from
the
graver
scenes
of
the
principal
apartments
it
might
be
said
to
be
sacred
to
the
pious
feelings
of
the
domestic
affections
sir
edward
would
retire
to
it
when
fatigued
with
his
occupations
certain
of
finding
some
one
of
those
he
loved
to
draw
his
thoughts
off
from
the
cares
of
life
to
the
little
incidents
of
his
children
happiness
and
lady
moseley
even
in
the
proudest
hours
of
her
reviving
splendor
seldom
passed
the
door
without
looking
in
with
a
smile
on
the
faces
she
might
find
there
it
was
in
fact
the
room
in
the
large
mansion
of
the
baronet
expressly
devoted
by
long
usage
and
common
consent
to
the
purest
feelings
of
human
nature
into
this
apartment
denbigh
had
gained
admission
as
the
one
nearest
to
his
own
room
and
requiring
the
least
effort
of
his
returning
strength
to
reach
and
perhaps
by
an
undefinable
feeling
of
the
moseleys
which
had
begun
to
connect
him
with
themselves
partly
from
his
winning
manners
and
partly
by
the
sense
of
the
obligation
he
had
laid
them
under
one
warm
day
john
and
his
friend
had
sought
this
retreat
in
expectation
of
meeting
his
sisters
who
they
found
however
on
inquiry
had
walked
to
the
arbor
after
remaining
conversing
for
an
hour
by
themselves
john
was
called
away
to
attend
to
a
pointer
that
had
been
taken
ill
and
denbigh
throwing
a
handkerchief
over
his
head
to
guard
against
the
danger
of
cold
quietly
composed
himself
on
one
of
the
comfortable
sofas
of
the
room
with
a
disposition
to
sleep
before
he
had
entirely
lost
his
consciousness
a
light
step
moving
near
him
caught
his
ear
believing
it
to
be
a
servant
unwilling
to
disturb
him
he
endeavored
to
continue
in
his
present
mood
until
the
quick
but
stifled
breathing
of
some
one
nearer
than
before
roused
his
curiosity
he
commanded
himself
however
sufficiently
to
remain
quiet
a
blind
of
a
window
near
him
was
carefully
closed
a
screen
drawn
from
a
corner
and
placed
so
as
sensibly
to
destroy
the
slight
draught
of
air
in
which
he
laid
himself
and
other
arrangements
were
making
but
with
a
care
to
avoid
disturbing
him
that
rendered
them
hardly
audible
presently
the
step
approached
him
again
the
breathing
was
quicker
though
gentle
the
handkerchief
was
moved
but
the
hand
was
with
drawn
hastily
as
if
afraid
of
itself
another
effort
was
successful
and
denbigh
stole
a
glance
through
his
dark
lashes
on
the
figure
of
emily
as
she
stood
over
him
in
the
fulness
of
her
charms
and
with
a
face
in
which
glowed
an
interest
he
had
never
witnessed
in
it
before
it
undoubtedly
was
gratitude
for
a
moment
she
gazed
on
him
as
her
color
increased
in
richness
his
hand
was
carelessly
thrown
over
an
arm
of
the
sofa
she
stooped
towards
it
with
her
face
gently
but
with
an
air
of
modesty
that
shone
in
her
very
figure
denbigh
felt
the
warmth
of
her
breath
but
her
lips
did
not
touch
it
had
he
been
inclined
to
judge
the
actions
of
emily
moseley
harshly
it
were
impossible
to
mistake
the
movement
for
anything
but
the
impulse
of
natural
feeling
there
was
a
pledge
of
innocence
of
modesty
in
her
countenance
that
would
have
prevented
any
misconstruction
and
he
continued
quietly
awaiting
what
the
preparations
on
her
little
mahogany
secretary
were
intended
for
wilson
entertained
a
great
abhorrence
of
what
is
commonly
called
accomplishments
in
a
woman
she
knew
that
too
much
of
that
precious
time
which
could
never
be
recalled
was
thrown
away
in
endeavoring
to
acquire
a
smattering
in
what
if
known
could
never
be
of
use
to
the
party
and
what
can
never
be
well
known
but
to
a
few
whom
nature
and
long
practice
have
enabled
to
conquer
yet
as
her
niece
had
early
manifested
a
taste
for
painting
and
a
vivid
perception
of
the
beauties
of
nature
her
inclination
had
been
indulged
and
emily
moseley
sketched
with
neatness
and
accuracy
and
with
great
readiness
it
would
have
been
no
subject
of
surprise
had
admiration
or
some
more
powerful
feeling
betrayed
to
the
artist
on
this
occasion
the
deception
the
young
man
was
practising
she
had
entered
the
room
from
her
walk
warm
and
careless
her
hair
than
which
none
was
more
beautiful
had
strayed
on
her
shoulders
freed
from
the
confinement
of
the
comb
and
a
lock
was
finely
contrasted
to
the
rich
color
of
a
cheek
that
almost
burnt
with
the
exercise
and
the
excitement
her
dress
white
as
the
first
snow
of
the
winter
her
looks
as
she
now
turned
them
on
the
face
of
the
sleeper
and
betrayed
by
their
animation
the
success
of
her
art
formed
a
picture
in
itself
that
denbigh
would
have
been
content
to
gaze
on
for
ever
her
back
was
to
a
window
that
threw
its
strong
light
on
the
paper
the
figures
of
which
were
reflected
as
she
occasionally
held
it
up
to
study
its
effect
in
a
large
mirror
so
placed
that
denbigh
caught
a
view
of
her
subject
he
knew
it
at
a
glance
the
arbor
the
gun
himself
all
were
there
it
appeared
to
have
been
drawn
before
it
must
have
been
from
its
perfect
state
and
emily
had
seized
a
favorable
moment
to
complete
his
own
resemblance
her
touches
were
light
and
finishing
and
as
the
picture
was
frequently
held
up
for
consideration
he
had
some
time
allowed
for
studying
it
his
own
resemblance
was
strong
his
eyes
were
turned
on
herself
to
whom
denbigh
thought
she
had
not
done
ample
justice
but
the
man
who
held
the
gun
bore
no
likeness
to
john
moseley
except
in
dress
a
slight
movement
of
the
muscles
of
the
sleeper
mouth
might
have
betrayed
his
consciousness
had
not
emily
been
too
intent
on
the
picture
as
she
turned
it
in
such
a
way
that
a
strong
light
fell
on
the
recoiling
figure
of
captain
jarvis
the
resemblance
was
wonderful
denbigh
thought
he
would
have
known
it
had
he
seen
it
in
the
academy
itself
the
noise
of
some
one
approaching
closed
the
portfolio
it
was
only
a
servant
yet
emily
did
not
resume
her
pencil
denbigh
watched
her
motions
as
she
put
the
picture
carefully
in
a
private
drawer
of
the
secretary
reopened
the
blind
replaced
the
screen
and
laid
the
handkerchief
the
last
thing
on
his
face
with
a
movement
almost
imperceptible
to
himself
it
is
later
than
i
thought
said
denbigh
looking
at
his
watch
i
owe
an
apology
miss
moseley
for
making
so
free
with
your
parlor
but
i
was
too
lazy
to
move
apology
denbigh
cried
emily
with
a
color
varying
with
every
word
she
spoke
and
trembling
at
what
she
thought
the
nearness
of
detection
you
have
no
apology
to
make
for
your
present
debility
and
surely
surely
least
of
all
to
me
i
understand
from
moseley
continued
denbigh
with
a
smile
that
our
obligation
is
at
least
mutual
to
your
perseverance
and
care
miss
moseley
after
the
physicians
had
given
me
up
i
believe
i
am
under
providence
indebted
for
my
recovery
emily
was
not
vain
and
least
of
all
addicted
to
a
display
of
any
of
her
acquirements
very
few
even
of
her
friends
knew
she
ever
held
a
pencil
in
her
hand
yet
did
she
now
unaccountably
throw
open
her
portfolio
and
offer
its
contents
to
the
examination
of
her
companion
it
was
done
almost
instantaneously
and
with
great
freedom
though
not
without
certain
flushings
of
the
face
and
heavings
of
the
bosom
that
would
have
eclipsed
grace
chatterton
in
her
happiest
moments
of
natural
flattery
whatever
might
have
been
the
wishes
of
denbigh
to
pursue
a
subject
which
had
begun
to
grow
extremely
interesting
both
from
its
import
and
the
feelings
of
the
parties
it
would
have
been
rude
to
decline
viewing
the
contents
of
a
lady
portfolio
the
drawings
were
many
of
them
interesting
and
the
exhibitor
of
them
now
appeared
as
anxious
to
remove
them
in
haste
as
she
had
but
the
moment
before
been
to
direct
his
attention
to
her
performances
denbigh
would
have
given
much
to
dare
to
ask
for
the
paper
so
carefully
secreted
in
the
private
drawer
but
neither
the
principal
agency
he
had
himself
in
the
scene
nor
delicacy
to
his
companion
wish
for
concealment
would
allow
of
the
request
doctor
ives
how
happy
i
am
to
see
you
said
emily
hastily
closing
her
portfolio
and
before
denbigh
had
gone
half
through
its
contents
you
have
become
almost
a
stranger
to
us
since
clara
left
us
no
no
my
little
friend
never
a
stranger
i
hope
at
moseley
hall
cried
the
doctor
pleasantly
george
i
am
happy
to
see
you
look
so
well
you
have
even
a
color
there
is
a
letter
for
you
from
marian
denbigh
took
the
letter
eagerly
and
retired
to
a
window
to
peruse
it
his
hand
shook
as
he
broke
the
seal
and
his
interest
in
the
writer
or
its
contents
could
not
have
escaped
the
notice
of
any
observer
however
indifferent
now
miss
emily
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
order
me
a
glass
of
wine
and
water
after
my
ride
believe
me
you
will
do
a
very
charitable
act
cried
the
doctor
as
he
took
his
seat
on
the
sofa
emily
was
standing
by
the
little
table
deeply
musing
on
the
contents
of
her
portfolio
for
her
eyes
were
intently
fixed
on
the
outside
as
if
she
expected
to
see
through
the
leather
covering
their
merits
and
faults
miss
emily
moseley
continued
the
doctor
gravely
am
i
to
die
of
thirst
or
not
this
warm
day
do
you
wish
anything
doctor
ives
a
servant
to
get
me
a
glass
of
wine
and
water
why
did
you
not
ask
me
my
dear
sir
said
emily
as
she
threw
open
a
cellaret
and
handed
him
what
he
wanted
there
my
dear
there
is
a
great
plenty
said
the
doctor
with
an
arch
expression
i
really
thought
i
had
asked
you
thrice
but
i
believe
you
were
studying
something
in
that
portfolio
emily
blushed
and
endeavored
to
laugh
at
her
own
absence
of
mind
but
she
would
have
given
the
world
to
know
who
marian
was
chapter
xx
as
a
month
had
elapsed
since
he
received
his
wound
denbigh
took
an
opportunity
one
morning
at
breakfast
where
he
was
well
enough
now
to
meet
his
friends
to
announce
his
intention
of
trespassing
no
longer
on
their
kindness
but
of
returning
that
day
to
the
rectory
the
communication
distressed
the
whole
family
and
the
baronet
turned
to
him
in
the
most
cordial
manner
as
he
took
one
of
his
hands
and
said
with
an
air
of
solemnity
denbigh
i
could
wish
you
to
make
this
house
your
home
ives
may
have
known
you
longer
and
may
have
the
claim
of
relationship
on
you
but
i
am
certain
he
can
not
love
you
better
and
are
not
the
ties
of
gratitude
as
binding
as
those
of
blood
denbigh
was
affected
by
the
kindness
of
sir
edward
manner
the
regiment
i
belong
to
sir
edward
will
be
reviewed
next
week
and
it
has
become
my
duty
to
leave
here
there
is
one
it
is
proper
i
should
visit
a
near
connexion
who
is
acquainted
with
the
escape
i
have
met
with
and
wishes
naturally
to
see
me
besides
my
dear
sir
edward
she
has
many
causes
of
sorrow
and
it
is
a
debt
i
owe
her
affection
to
endeavor
to
relieve
them
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
spoken
of
his
family
or
hardly
of
himself
and
the
silence
which
prevailed
plainly
showed
the
interest
his
listeners
took
in
the
little
he
uttered
that
connexion
thought
emily
i
wonder
if
her
name
be
marian
but
nothing
further
passed
excepting
the
affectionate
regrets
of
her
father
and
the
promises
of
denbigh
to
visit
them
again
before
he
left
b
and
of
joining
them
at
l
immediately
after
the
review
of
which
he
had
spoken
as
soon
as
he
had
breakfasted
john
drove
him
in
his
phaeton
to
the
rectory
wilson
like
the
rest
of
the
baronet
family
had
been
too
deeply
impressed
with
the
debt
they
owed
this
young
man
to
interfere
with
her
favorite
system
of
caution
against
too
great
an
intimacy
between
her
niece
and
her
preserver
close
observation
and
the
opinion
of
ives
had
prepared
her
to
give
him
her
esteem
but
the
gallantry
the
devotion
he
had
displayed
to
emily
was
an
act
calculated
to
remove
heavier
objections
than
she
could
imagine
as
likely
to
exist
to
his
becoming
her
husband
that
he
meant
it
was
evident
from
his
whole
deportment
of
late
since
the
morning
the
portfolio
was
produced
denbigh
had
given
a
more
decided
preference
to
her
niece
the
nice
discrimination
of
wilson
would
not
have
said
his
feelings
had
become
stronger
but
that
he
labored
less
to
conceal
them
that
he
loved
her
niece
she
suspected
from
the
first
fortnight
of
their
acquaintance
and
it
had
given
additional
stimulus
to
her
investigation
into
his
character
but
to
doubt
it
after
stepping
between
her
and
death
would
have
been
to
have
mistaken
human
nature
there
was
one
qualification
she
would
have
wished
to
have
been
certain
he
possessed
before
this
accident
she
would
have
made
it
an
indispensable
one
but
the
gratitude
the
affections
of
emily
she
believed
now
to
be
too
deeply
engaged
to
make
the
strict
inquiry
she
otherwise
would
have
done
and
she
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
believing
that
if
denbigh
were
not
a
true
christian
he
was
at
least
a
strictly
moral
man
and
assuredly
one
who
well
understood
the
beauties
of
a
religion
she
almost
conceived
it
impossible
for
any
impartial
and
intelligent
man
long
to
resist
perhaps
wilson
having
in
some
measure
interfered
with
her
system
like
others
had
on
finding
it
impossible
to
conduct
so
that
reason
would
justify
all
she
did
began
to
find
reasons
for
what
she
thought
best
to
be
done
under
the
circumstances
denbigh
however
both
by
his
acts
and
his
opinions
had
created
such
an
estimate
of
his
worth
in
the
breast
of
wilson
that
there
would
have
been
but
little
danger
of
a
repulse
had
no
fortuitous
accident
helped
him
in
his
way
to
her
favor
who
have
we
here
said
lady
moseley
a
landaulet
and
four
the
earl
of
bolton
i
declare
lady
moseley
turned
from
the
window
with
that
collected
grace
she
so
well
loved
and
so
well
knew
how
to
assume
to
receive
her
noble
visitor
lord
bolton
was
a
bachelor
of
who
had
long
been
attached
to
the
court
and
retained
much
of
the
manners
of
the
old
school
his
principal
estate
was
in
ireland
and
most
of
that
time
which
his
duty
at
windsor
did
not
require
he
gave
to
the
improvement
of
his
irish
property
thus
although
on
perfectly
good
terms
with
the
baronet
family
they
seldom
met
with
general
wilson
he
had
been
at
college
and
to
his
widow
he
always
showed
much
of
that
regard
he
had
invariably
professed
for
her
husband
the
obligation
he
had
conferred
unasked
on
francis
ives
was
one
conferred
on
all
his
friends
and
his
reception
was
now
warmer
than
usual
my
lady
moseley
said
the
earl
bowing
formally
on
her
hand
your
looks
do
ample
justice
to
the
air
of
northamptonshire
i
hope
you
enjoy
your
usual
health
then
waiting
her
equally
courteous
answer
he
paid
his
compliments
in
succession
to
all
the
members
of
the
family
a
mode
undoubtedly
well
adapted
to
discover
their
several
conditions
but
not
a
little
tedious
in
its
operations
and
somewhat
tiresome
to
the
legs
we
are
under
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
your
lordship
said
sir
edward
in
his
simple
and
way
that
i
am
sorry
it
is
not
in
our
power
to
repay
more
amply
than
by
our
thanks
the
earl
was
or
affected
to
be
surprised
as
he
required
an
explanation
the
living
at
bolton
said
lady
moseley
with
dignity
yes
continued
her
husband
in
giving
the
living
to
frank
you
did
me
a
favor
equal
to
what
you
would
have
done
had
he
been
my
own
child
and
unsolicited
too
my
lord
it
was
an
additional
compliment
the
earl
sat
rather
uneasy
during
this
speech
but
the
love
of
truth
prevailed
for
he
had
been
too
much
round
the
person
of
our
beloved
sovereign
not
to
retain
all
the
impressions
of
his
youth
and
after
a
little
struggle
with
his
he
answered
not
unsolicited
sir
edward
i
have
no
doubt
had
nay
better
fortune
allowed
me
the
acquaintance
of
my
present
rector
his
own
merit
would
have
obtained
what
a
sense
of
justice
requires
i
should
say
was
granted
to
an
applicant
to
whom
the
ear
of
royalty
itself
would
not
have
been
deaf
it
was
the
turn
of
the
moseleys
now
to
look
surprised
and
sir
edward
ventured
to
ask
an
explanation
it
was
my
cousin
the
earl
of
pendennyss
who
applied
for
it
as
a
favor
done
to
himself
and
pendennyss
is
a
man
not
to
be
refused
anything
lord
pendennyss
exclaimed
wilson
with
animation
and
in
what
way
came
we
to
be
under
this
obligation
to
lord
pendennyss
he
did
me
the
honor
of
a
call
during
my
visit
to
ireland
madam
replied
the
earl
and
on
inquiring
of
my
steward
after
his
old
friend
doctor
stevens
learnt
his
death
and
the
claims
of
ives
but
the
reason
he
gave
me
was
his
interest
in
the
widow
of
general
wilson
bowing
with
much
solemnity
to
the
lady
as
he
spoke
i
am
gratified
to
find
the
earl
yet
remembers
us
said
wilson
struggling
to
restrain
her
tears
are
we
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
soon
i
received
a
letter
from
him
yesterday
saying
he
should
be
here
in
all
next
week
madam
and
turning
pleasantly
to
jane
and
her
sister
he
continued
sir
edward
you
have
here
rewards
fit
for
heavier
services
and
the
earl
is
a
great
admirer
of
female
charms
is
he
not
married
my
lord
asked
the
baronet
with
great
simplicity
no
baronet
nor
engaged
but
how
long
he
will
remain
so
after
his
hardihood
in
venturing
into
this
neighborhood
will
i
trust
depend
on
one
of
these
young
ladies
jane
looked
grave
for
trifling
on
love
was
heresy
in
her
estimation
but
emily
laughed
with
an
expression
in
which
a
skilful
physiognomist
might
have
read
if
he
means
me
he
is
mistaken
your
cousin
lord
chatterton
has
found
interest
sir
edward
continued
the
peer
to
obtain
his
father
situation
and
if
reports
speak
truth
he
wishes
to
become
more
nearly
related
to
you
baronet
i
do
not
well
see
how
that
can
happen
said
sir
edward
with
a
smile
and
who
had
not
art
enough
to
conceal
his
thoughts
unless
he
takes
my
sister
here
the
cheeks
of
both
the
young
ladies
now
vied
with
the
rose
and
the
peer
observing
he
had
touched
on
forbidden
ground
added
chatterton
was
fortunate
to
find
friends
able
to
bear
up
against
the
powerful
interest
of
lord
haverford
to
whom
was
he
indebted
for
the
place
my
lord
asked
mis
wilson
it
was
whispered
at
court
madam
said
the
earl
sensibly
lowering
his
voice
and
speaking
with
an
air
of
mystery
and
a
lord
of
the
chamber
is
fonder
of
discoveries
than
a
lord
of
the
council
that
his
grace
of
derwent
threw
the
whole
of
his
parliamentary
interest
into
the
scale
on
the
baron
side
but
you
are
not
to
suppose
raising
his
hand
gracefully
with
a
wave
of
rejection
that
i
speak
from
authority
only
a
surmise
sir
edward
only
a
surmise
my
lady
is
not
the
name
of
the
duke
of
derwent
denbigh
inquired
wilson
with
a
thoughtful
manner
certainly
madam
denbigh
replied
the
earl
with
a
gravity
with
which
he
always
spoke
of
dignities
one
of
our
most
ancient
names
and
descended
on
the
female
side
from
the
plantagenets
and
tudors
he
now
rose
to
take
his
leave
and
on
bowing
to
the
younger
ladies
laughingly
repeated
his
intention
of
bringing
his
cousin
an
epithet
he
never
omitted
pendennyss
to
their
feet
do
you
think
sister
said
lady
moseley
after
the
earl
had
retired
that
denbigh
is
of
the
house
of
derwent
i
can
not
say
replied
wilson
musing
yet
it
is
odd
chatterton
told
me
of
his
acquaintance
with
lady
harriet
denbigh
but
not
with
the
duke
as
this
was
spoken
in
the
manner
of
a
soliloquy
it
received
no
answer
and
was
in
fact
but
little
attended
to
by
any
of
the
party
excepting
emily
who
glanced
her
eye
once
or
twice
at
her
aunt
as
she
was
speaking
with
an
interest
the
name
of
denbigh
never
failed
to
excite
harriet
was
she
thought
a
pretty
name
but
marian
was
a
prettier
if
thought
emily
i
could
know
a
marian
denbigh
i
am
sure
i
could
love
her
and
her
name
too
the
moseleys
now
began
to
make
their
preparations
for
their
departure
to
l
and
the
end
of
the
succeeding
week
was
fixed
for
the
period
at
which
they
were
to
go
wilson
urged
a
delay
of
two
or
three
days
in
order
to
give
her
an
opportunity
of
meeting
with
the
earl
of
pendennyss
a
young
man
in
whom
although
she
had
relinquished
her
former
romantic
wish
of
uniting
him
to
emily
in
favor
of
denbigh
she
yet
felt
a
deep
interest
growing
out
of
his
connexion
with
the
last
moments
of
her
husband
and
his
uniformly
high
character
sir
edward
accordingly
acquainted
his
uncle
that
on
the
following
saturday
he
might
expect
to
receive
himself
and
family
intending
to
leave
the
hall
in
the
afternoon
of
the
preceding
day
and
reach
benfield
lodge
to
dinner
this
arrangement
once
made
and
benfield
notified
of
it
was
unalterable
the
old
man
holding
a
variation
from
an
engagement
a
deadly
sin
the
week
succeeding
the
accident
which
had
nearly
proved
so
fatal
to
denbigh
the
inhabitants
of
the
hall
were
surprised
with
the
approach
of
a
being
as
singular
in
his
manners
and
dress
as
the
equipage
which
conveyed
him
to
the
door
of
the
house
the
latter
consisted
of
a
sulky
loaded
with
leather
and
brass
nails
wheels
at
least
a
quarter
larger
in
circumference
than
those
of
the
present
day
and
wings
on
each
side
large
enough
to
have
supported
a
full
grown
roc
in
the
highest
regions
of
the
upper
air
it
was
drawn
by
a
horse
once
white
but
whose
milky
hue
was
tarnished
through
age
with
large
and
numerous
red
spots
and
whose
mane
and
tail
did
not
appear
to
have
suffered
by
the
shears
during
the
present
reign
the
being
who
alighted
from
this
antiquated
vehicle
was
tall
and
excessively
thin
wore
his
own
hair
drawn
over
his
almost
naked
head
into
a
long
thin
queue
which
reached
half
way
down
his
back
closely
cased
in
numerous
windings
of
leather
or
the
skin
of
some
fish
his
drab
coat
was
in
shape
between
a
frock
and
a
indeed
it
was
for
the
buttons
which
were
in
size
about
equal
to
an
china
saucer
were
buttoned
to
the
very
throat
thereby
setting
off
his
shape
to
peculiar
advantage
his
breeches
were
buckskin
and
much
soiled
his
stockings
blue
yarn
although
it
was
midsummer
and
his
shoes
were
provided
with
buckles
of
dimensions
proportionate
to
the
aforesaid
buttons
his
age
might
have
been
seventy
but
his
walk
was
quick
and
the
movements
of
his
whole
system
showed
great
activity
both
of
mind
and
body
he
was
ushered
into
the
room
where
the
gentlemen
were
sitting
and
having
made
a
low
and
extremely
modest
bow
he
deliberately
put
on
his
spectacles
thrust
his
hand
into
an
outside
pocket
of
his
coat
and
produced
from
under
its
huge
flaps
a
black
leathern
book
about
as
large
as
a
octavo
volume
after
examining
the
multitude
of
papers
it
contained
carefully
he
selected
a
letter
and
having
returned
the
to
its
ample
apartment
read
aloud
for
sir
edward
moseley
bart
of
moseley
hall
b
care
and
speed
by
the
hands
of
peter
johnson
steward
of
benfield
lodge
norfolk
and
dropping
his
sharp
voice
he
stalked
up
to
the
baronet
and
presented
the
epistle
with
another
reverence
ah
my
good
friend
johnson
said
sir
edward
as
soon
as
he
delivered
his
errand
for
until
he
saw
the
contents
of
the
letter
he
had
thought
some
accident
had
occurred
to
his
uncle
this
is
the
first
visit
you
have
ever
honored
me
with
come
take
a
glass
of
wine
before
you
go
to
your
dinner
let
us
drink
that
it
may
not
be
the
last
sir
edward
moseley
and
you
honorable
gentlemen
will
pardon
me
replied
the
steward
in
his
own
solemn
key
this
is
the
first
time
i
was
ever
out
of
his
majesty
county
of
norfolk
and
i
devoutly
wish
it
may
prove
the
last
gentlemen
i
drink
your
honorable
healths
this
was
the
only
real
speech
the
old
man
made
during
his
visit
unless
an
occasional
monosyllabic
reply
to
a
question
could
be
thought
so
he
remained
by
sir
edward
positive
order
until
the
following
day
for
having
delivered
his
message
and
receiving
its
answer
he
was
about
to
take
his
departure
that
evening
thinking
he
might
get
a
good
piece
on
his
road
homewards
as
it
wanted
half
an
hour
to
sunset
on
the
following
morning
with
the
sun
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
house
in
which
he
had
been
born
and
which
he
had
never
left
for
hours
at
a
time
in
his
life
in
the
evening
as
he
was
ushered
in
by
john
who
had
known
him
from
his
own
childhood
and
loved
to
show
him
attention
to
the
room
in
which
he
was
to
sleep
he
broke
what
the
young
man
called
his
inveterate
silence
with
young
moseley
young
gentleman
might
i
presume
to
ask
to
see
the
gentleman
what
gentleman
cried
john
astonished
at
the
request
and
at
his
speaking
so
much
that
saved
miss
emmy
life
sir
john
now
fully
comprehended
him
and
led
the
way
to
denbigh
room
he
was
asleep
but
they
were
admitted
to
his
the
steward
stood
for
ten
minutes
gazing
on
the
sleeper
in
silence
and
john
observed
as
he
blew
his
nose
on
regaining
his
own
apartment
that
his
little
grey
eyes
twinkled
with
a
lustre
which
could
not
be
taken
for
anything
but
a
tear
as
the
letter
was
as
characteristic
of
the
writer
as
its
bearer
was
of
his
vocation
we
may
be
excused
giving
it
at
length
dear
sir
edward
and
nephew
your
letter
reached
the
lodge
too
late
to
be
answered
that
evening
as
i
was
about
to
step
into
my
bed
but
i
hasten
to
write
my
congratulations
remembering
the
often
repeated
maxim
of
my
kinsman
lord
gosford
that
letters
should
be
answered
immediately
indeed
a
neglect
of
it
had
very
nigh
brought
about
an
affair
of
honor
between
the
earl
and
sir
stephens
hallett
sir
stephens
was
always
opposed
to
us
in
the
house
of
commons
of
this
realm
and
i
have
often
thought
something
might
have
passed
in
the
debate
itself
which
commenced
the
correspondence
as
the
earl
certainly
told
him
as
much
as
if
he
were
a
traitor
to
his
king
and
country
but
it
seems
that
your
daughter
emily
has
been
rescued
from
death
by
the
grandson
of
general
denbigh
who
sat
with
us
in
the
house
now
i
always
had
a
good
opinion
of
this
young
denbigh
who
reminds
me
every
time
i
look
at
him
of
my
late
brother
your
that
was
and
i
send
my
steward
peter
johnson
express
to
the
hall
in
order
that
he
may
see
the
sick
man
and
bring
me
back
a
true
account
how
he
fares
for
should
he
be
wanting
for
anything
within
the
gift
of
roderic
benfield
he
has
only
to
speak
to
have
it
not
that
i
suppose
nephew
you
will
willingly
allow
him
to
suffer
for
anything
but
peter
is
a
man
of
close
observation
although
he
is
of
few
words
and
may
suggest
something
beneficial
that
might
escape
younger
heads
i
pray
for
that
is
i
hope
the
young
man
will
recover
as
your
letter
gives
great
hopes
and
if
he
should
want
any
little
matter
to
help
him
along
in
the
army
as
i
take
it
he
is
not
over
wealthy
you
have
now
a
good
opportunity
to
offer
your
assistance
handsomely
and
that
it
may
not
interfere
with
your
arrangements
for
this
winter
your
draft
on
me
for
five
thousand
pounds
will
be
paid
at
sight
for
fear
he
may
be
proud
and
not
choose
to
accept
your
assistance
i
have
this
morning
detained
peter
while
he
has
put
a
codicil
to
my
will
leaving
him
ten
thousand
pounds
you
may
tell
emily
she
is
a
naughty
child
or
she
would
have
written
me
the
whole
story
but
poor
dear
i
suppose
she
has
other
things
on
her
mind
just
now
god
bless
that
is
god
bless
you
all
and
try
if
you
can
not
get
a
at
once
the
brother
of
lady
friend
was
made
a
at
the
first
step
roderic
benfield
the
result
of
peter
reconnoitering
expedition
has
never
reached
our
knowledge
unless
the
arrival
of
a
servant
some
days
after
he
took
his
leave
with
a
pair
of
and
which
the
old
gentleman
assured
his
nephew
in
a
note
both
peter
and
himself
had
found
useful
to
weak
eyes
in
their
occasional
sickness
might
have
been
owing
to
the
prudent
forecast
of
the
sagacious
steward
chapter
xxi
the
morning
on
which
denbigh
left
b
was
a
melancholy
one
to
all
the
members
of
the
little
circle
in
which
he
had
been
so
distinguished
for
his
modesty
his
intelligence
and
his
disinterested
intrepidity
sir
edward
took
an
opportunity
solemnly
to
express
his
gratitude
for
the
services
he
had
rendered
him
and
having
retired
to
his
library
delicately
and
earnestly
pressed
his
availing
himself
of
the
liberal
offer
of
benfield
to
advance
his
interest
in
the
army
look
upon
me
my
dear
denbigh
said
the
good
baronet
pressing
him
by
the
hand
while
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
as
a
father
to
supply
the
place
of
the
one
you
have
so
recently
lost
you
are
my
child
i
feel
as
a
parent
to
you
and
must
be
suffered
to
act
as
one
to
this
affectionate
offer
of
sir
edward
denbigh
replied
with
an
emotion
equal
to
that
of
the
baronet
though
he
declined
with
respectful
language
his
offered
assistance
as
unnecessary
he
had
friends
powerful
enough
to
advance
his
interests
without
resorting
to
the
use
of
money
and
on
taking
sir
edward
hand
as
he
left
the
apartment
he
added
with
great
warmth
yet
my
dear
sir
the
day
will
come
i
hope
when
i
shall
ask
a
boon
from
your
hands
that
no
act
of
mine
or
a
life
of
service
could
entitle
me
to
receive
the
baronet
smiled
his
assent
to
a
request
he
already
understood
and
denbigh
withdrew
john
moseley
insisted
on
putting
the
bays
in
requisition
to
carry
denbigh
for
the
first
stage
and
they
now
stood
caparisoned
for
the
jaunt
with
their
master
in
a
less
joyous
mood
than
common
waiting
the
appearance
of
his
companion
emily
delighted
in
their
annual
excursion
to
benfield
lodge
she
was
beloved
so
warmly
and
returned
the
affection
of
its
owner
so
sincerely
that
the
arrival
of
the
day
never
failed
to
excite
that
flow
of
spirits
which
generally
accompanies
anticipated
pleasures
ere
experience
has
proved
how
trifling
are
the
greatest
enjoyments
the
scenes
of
this
life
bestow
yet
as
the
day
of
their
departure
drew
near
her
spirits
sunk
in
proportion
and
on
the
morning
of
denbigh
emily
seemed
anything
but
excessively
happy
there
was
a
tremor
in
her
voice
and
a
redness
about
her
eyes
that
alarmed
lady
moseley
but
as
the
paleness
of
her
cheeks
was
immediately
succeeded
by
as
fine
a
color
as
the
heart
could
wish
the
anxious
mother
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
by
wilson
there
was
no
danger
and
she
accompanied
her
sister
to
her
own
room
for
some
purpose
of
domestic
economy
it
was
at
this
moment
denbigh
entered
he
had
paid
his
adieus
to
the
matrons
at
the
door
and
been
directed
by
them
to
the
little
parlor
in
quest
of
emily
i
have
come
to
make
my
parting
compliments
miss
moseley
he
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
as
he
ventured
to
hold
forth
his
hand
may
heaven
preserve
you
he
continued
holding
it
in
fervor
to
his
bosom
then
dropping
it
he
hastily
retired
as
if
unwilling
to
trust
himself
any
longer
to
utter
all
he
felt
emily
stood
a
few
moments
pale
and
almost
inanimate
as
the
tears
flowed
rapidly
from
her
eyes
and
then
she
sought
a
shelter
in
a
seat
of
the
window
lady
moseley
on
returning
was
alarmed
lest
the
draught
would
increase
her
indisposition
but
her
sister
observing
that
the
window
commanded
a
view
of
the
road
thought
the
air
too
mild
to
do
her
injury
the
personages
who
composed
the
society
at
b
had
now
in
a
great
measure
separated
in
pursuit
of
their
duties
or
their
pleasures
the
merchant
and
his
family
left
the
deanery
for
a
francis
and
clara
had
gone
on
a
little
tour
of
pleasure
in
the
northern
counties
to
take
l
in
their
return
homeward
and
the
morning
arrived
for
the
commencement
of
the
baronet
journey
to
the
same
place
the
carriages
had
been
ordered
and
servants
were
running
in
various
ways
busily
employed
in
their
several
occupations
when
wilson
accompanied
by
john
and
his
sisters
returned
from
a
walk
they
had
taken
to
avoid
the
bustle
of
the
house
a
short
distance
from
the
park
gates
an
equipage
was
observed
approaching
creating
by
its
numerous
horses
and
attendants
a
dust
which
drove
the
pedestrians
to
one
side
of
the
road
an
uncommonly
elegant
and
admirably
fitted
travelling
barouche
and
six
rolled
by
with
the
graceful
steadiness
of
an
english
equipage
several
servants
on
horseback
were
in
attendance
and
our
little
party
were
struck
with
the
beauty
of
the
whole
establishment
can
it
be
possible
lord
bolton
drives
such
elegant
horses
cried
john
with
the
ardor
of
a
connoisseur
in
that
noble
animal
they
are
the
finest
set
in
the
kingdom
jane
eye
had
seen
through
the
clouds
of
dust
the
armorial
bearings
which
seemed
to
float
in
the
dark
glossy
panels
of
the
carriage
and
she
observed
it
is
an
earl
coronet
but
they
are
not
the
bolton
arms
wilson
and
emily
had
noticed
a
gentleman
reclining
at
his
ease
as
the
owner
of
the
gallant
show
but
its
passage
was
too
rapid
to
enable
them
to
distinguish
the
features
of
the
courteous
old
earl
indeed
wilson
remarked
she
thought
him
a
younger
man
than
her
friend
pray
sir
said
john
to
a
tardy
groom
as
he
civilly
walked
his
horse
by
the
ladies
who
has
passed
in
the
barouche
my
lord
pendennyss
sir
pendennyss
exclaimed
wilson
with
a
tone
of
regret
how
unfortunate
she
had
seen
the
day
named
for
his
visit
pass
without
his
arrival
and
now
as
it
was
too
late
to
profit
by
the
opportunity
he
had
come
for
the
second
time
into
her
neighborhood
emily
had
learnt
by
the
solicitude
of
her
aunt
to
take
an
interest
in
the
young
movements
and
desired
john
to
ask
a
question
or
two
of
the
groom
where
does
your
lord
stop
at
bolton
castle
sir
and
i
heard
my
lord
tell
his
valet
that
he
intended
staying
one
day
hereabouts
and
the
day
after
he
goes
to
wales
your
honor
i
thank
you
friend
said
john
when
the
man
spurred
his
horse
after
the
cavalcade
the
carriages
were
at
the
door
and
sir
edward
had
been
hurrying
jane
to
enter
as
a
servant
in
a
rich
livery
and
well
mounted
galloped
up
and
delivered
a
letter
for
wilson
who
on
opening
it
read
the
following
the
earl
of
pendennyss
begs
leave
to
present
his
most
respectful
compliments
to
wilson
and
the
family
of
sir
edward
moseley
lord
pendennyss
will
have
the
honor
of
paying
his
respects
in
person
at
any
moment
that
the
widow
of
his
late
invaluable
friend
wilson
will
please
to
appoint
bolton
castle
friday
evening
to
this
note
wilson
bitterly
regretting
the
necessity
which
compelled
her
to
forego
the
pleasure
of
meeting
her
paragon
wrote
in
reply
a
short
letter
disliking
the
formality
of
a
note
my
lord
i
sincerely
regret
that
an
engagement
which
can
not
be
postponed
compels
us
to
leave
moseley
hall
within
the
hour
and
must
in
consequence
deprive
us
of
the
pleasure
of
your
intended
visit
but
as
circumstances
have
connected
your
lordship
with
some
of
the
dearest
although
the
most
melancholy
events
of
my
life
i
earnestly
beg
you
will
no
longer
consider
us
as
strangers
to
your
person
as
we
have
long
ceased
to
be
to
your
character
it
will
afford
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
hear
that
there
will
be
a
prospect
of
our
meeting
in
town
next
winter
where
i
may
find
a
more
fitting
opportunity
of
expressing
those
grateful
feelings
so
long
due
to
your
lordship
from
your
sincere
friend
charlotte
wilson
moseley
hall
friday
morning
with
this
answer
the
servant
was
despatched
and
the
carriages
moved
on
john
had
induced
emily
to
trust
herself
once
more
to
the
bays
and
his
skill
but
on
perceiving
the
melancholy
of
her
aunt
she
insisted
on
exchanging
seats
with
jane
who
had
accepted
a
place
in
the
carriage
of
wilson
no
objection
being
made
wilson
and
her
niece
rode
the
first
afternoon
together
in
her
travelling
chaise
the
road
ran
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
bolton
castle
and
the
ladies
endeavored
in
vain
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
person
of
the
young
nobleman
emily
was
willing
to
gratify
her
aunt
propensity
to
dwell
on
the
character
and
history
of
her
favorite
and
hoping
to
withdraw
her
attention
gradually
from
more
unpleasant
recollections
asked
several
trifling
questions
relating
to
those
points
the
earl
must
be
very
rich
aunt
from
the
style
he
maintains
very
my
dear
his
family
i
am
unacquainted
with
but
i
understand
his
title
is
an
extremely
ancient
one
and
some
one
i
believe
lord
bolton
mentioned
that
his
estates
in
wales
alone
exceeded
fifty
thousand
a
year
much
good
might
be
done
said
emily
thoughtfully
with
such
a
fortune
much
good
is
done
cried
her
aunt
with
fervor
i
am
told
by
every
one
who
knows
him
his
donations
are
large
and
frequent
sir
herbert
nicholson
said
he
was
extremely
simple
in
his
habits
and
it
leaves
large
sums
at
his
disposal
every
year
the
bestowal
of
money
is
not
always
charity
said
emily
with
an
arch
smile
and
a
slight
color
wilson
smiled
in
her
turn
as
she
answered
not
always
but
it
is
charity
to
hope
for
the
best
sir
herbert
knew
him
then
said
emily
perfectly
well
they
were
associated
together
in
the
service
for
several
years
and
he
spoke
of
him
with
a
fervor
equal
to
my
warmest
expectations
the
moseley
arms
in
f
was
kept
by
an
old
butler
of
the
family
and
sir
edward
every
year
in
going
to
or
coming
from
l
spent
a
night
under
its
roof
he
was
received
by
its
master
with
a
respect
that
none
who
ever
knew
the
baronet
well
could
withhold
from
his
goodness
of
heart
and
many
virtues
well
jackson
said
the
baronet
kindly
as
he
was
seated
at
the
supper
table
how
does
custom
increase
with
you
i
hope
you
and
the
master
of
the
dun
cow
are
more
amicable
than
formerly
why
sir
edward
replied
the
host
who
had
lost
a
little
of
the
deference
of
the
servant
in
the
landlord
but
none
of
his
real
respect
daniels
and
i
are
more
upon
a
footing
of
late
than
we
was
when
your
goodness
enabled
me
to
take
the
house
then
he
got
all
the
great
travellers
and
for
more
than
a
twelvemonth
i
had
not
a
title
in
my
house
but
yourself
and
a
great
london
doctor
that
was
called
here
to
see
a
sick
person
in
the
town
he
had
the
impudence
to
call
me
the
knight
your
honor
and
we
had
a
quarrel
upon
that
account
i
am
glad
however
to
find
you
are
gaining
in
the
rank
of
your
customers
and
trust
as
the
occasion
has
ceased
you
will
be
more
inclined
to
be
to
each
other
why
as
to
sir
edward
i
lived
with
your
honor
ten
years
and
you
must
know
somewhat
of
my
temper
said
jackson
with
the
satisfaction
of
an
approving
conscience
but
sam
daniels
is
a
man
who
is
never
easy
unless
he
is
left
quietly
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
however
continued
the
host
with
a
chuckle
i
have
given
him
a
dose
lately
how
so
jackson
inquired
the
baronet
willing
to
gratify
the
wish
to
relate
his
triumphs
your
honor
must
have
heard
mention
made
of
a
great
lord
the
duke
of
derwent
well
sir
edward
about
six
weeks
agone
he
passed
through
with
my
lord
chatterton
chatterton
exclaimed
john
interrupting
him
has
he
been
so
near
us
again
and
so
lately
yes
moseley
replied
jackson
with
a
look
of
importance
they
dashed
into
my
yard
with
their
chaise
and
four
with
five
servants
and
would
you
think
it
sir
edward
they
had
been
in
the
house
ten
minutes
before
daniel
son
was
fishing
from
the
servants
who
they
were
i
told
him
sir
edward
dukes
do
come
every
day
how
came
you
to
get
his
grace
away
from
the
dun
cow
chance
no
your
honor
said
the
host
pointing
to
his
sign
and
bowing
reverently
to
his
old
master
the
moseley
arms
did
it
daniels
used
to
taunt
me
with
having
worn
a
livery
and
has
said
more
than
once
he
could
milk
his
cow
but
that
your
honor
arms
would
never
lift
me
into
a
comfortable
seat
for
life
so
i
just
sent
him
a
message
by
the
way
of
letting
him
know
my
good
fortune
your
honor
and
what
was
it
only
that
your
honor
arms
had
shoved
a
duke
and
a
baron
into
my
house
that
all
and
i
suppose
daniels
legs
shoved
your
messenger
out
of
his
said
john
laughing
no
moseley
daniels
would
hardly
dare
do
that
but
yesterday
your
honor
yesterday
evening
beat
everything
daniels
was
seated
before
his
door
and
i
was
taking
a
pipe
at
mine
sir
edward
as
a
coach
and
six
with
servants
upon
servants
drove
down
the
street
it
got
near
us
and
the
boys
were
reining
the
horses
into
the
yard
of
the
dun
cow
as
the
gentleman
in
the
coach
saw
my
sign
he
sent
a
groom
to
inquire
who
kept
the
house
i
got
up
your
honor
and
told
him
my
name
sir
jackson
said
his
lordship
respect
for
the
family
of
sir
edward
moseley
is
too
great
not
to
give
my
custom
to
an
old
servant
of
his
family
indeed
said
the
baronet
pray
who
was
my
lord
the
earl
of
pendennyss
your
honor
oh
he
is
a
sweet
gentleman
and
he
asked
all
about
my
living
with
your
honor
and
about
madam
wilson
did
his
lordship
stay
the
night
inquired
wilson
excessively
gratified
at
a
discovery
of
the
disposition
manifested
by
the
earl
towards
her
yes
madam
he
left
here
after
breakfast
what
message
did
you
send
the
dun
cow
this
time
jackson
cried
john
jackson
looked
a
little
foolish
but
the
question
being
repeated
he
answered
why
sir
i
was
a
little
crowded
for
room
and
so
your
honor
so
i
just
sent
tom
across
the
street
to
know
if
daniels
keep
a
couple
of
the
grooms
and
tom
got
his
head
broke
no
john
the
tankard
missed
him
but
if
very
well
said
the
baronet
willing
to
change
the
conversation
you
have
been
so
fortunate
of
late
you
can
afford
to
be
generous
and
i
advise
you
to
cultivate
harmony
with
your
neighbor
or
i
may
take
my
arms
down
and
you
may
lose
your
noble
visiters
see
my
room
prepared
yes
your
honor
said
the
host
and
bowing
respectfully
he
withdrew
at
least
aunt
cried
john
pleasantly
we
have
the
pleasure
of
supping
in
the
same
room
with
the
puissant
earl
albeit
there
be
four
hours
difference
in
the
time
i
sincerely
wish
there
had
not
been
that
difference
observed
his
father
taking
his
sister
kindly
by
the
hand
such
an
equipage
must
have
been
a
harvest
indeed
to
jackson
remarked
the
mother
as
they
broke
up
for
the
evening
the
whole
establishment
at
benfield
lodge
were
drawn
up
to
receive
them
on
the
following
day
in
the
great
hall
and
in
the
centre
was
fixed
the
upright
and
lank
figure
of
its
master
with
his
companion
in
leanness
honest
peter
johnson
on
his
right
i
have
made
out
sir
edward
and
my
lady
moseley
to
get
as
far
as
my
entrance
to
receive
the
favor
you
are
conferring
upon
me
it
was
a
rule
in
my
day
and
one
invariably
practised
by
all
the
great
nobility
such
as
lord
gosford
and
and
his
sister
the
lady
juliana
dayton
always
to
receive
and
quit
their
guests
in
the
country
at
the
great
entrance
and
in
conformity
ah
emmy
dear
cried
the
old
gentleman
folding
her
in
his
arms
as
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
forgetting
his
speech
in
the
warmth
of
his
feeling
you
are
saved
to
us
again
god
be
praised
there
that
will
do
let
me
breathe
let
me
breathe
and
then
by
the
way
of
getting
rid
of
his
softer
feelings
he
turned
upon
john
so
youngster
you
would
be
playing
with
edge
tools
and
put
the
life
of
your
sister
in
danger
no
gentleman
held
a
gun
in
my
day
that
is
no
gentleman
about
the
court
my
lord
gosford
had
never
killed
a
bird
in
his
life
or
drove
his
horse
no
sir
gentlemen
then
were
not
coachmen
peter
how
old
was
i
before
i
took
the
reins
of
the
chaise
in
driving
round
the
estate
the
time
you
broke
your
arm
it
was
peter
who
stood
a
little
behind
his
master
in
modest
retirement
and
who
had
only
thought
his
elegant
form
brought
thither
to
embellish
the
show
when
called
upon
advanced
a
step
made
a
low
bow
and
answered
in
his
sharp
key
in
the
year
your
honor
and
the
of
his
present
majesty
and
the
year
of
your
life
sir
june
the
about
meridian
peter
dropped
back
as
he
finished
but
recollecting
himself
regained
his
place
with
a
bow
as
he
added
new
style
how
are
you
old
style
cried
john
with
a
slap
on
the
back
that
made
the
steward
jump
again
john
moseley
young
gentleman
a
term
peter
had
left
off
using
to
the
baronet
within
the
last
ten
years
did
you
think
to
bring
home
the
goggles
oh
yes
said
john
gravely
producing
them
from
his
pocket
most
of
the
party
having
entered
the
parlor
he
put
them
carefully
on
the
bald
head
of
the
steward
there
mr
peter
johnson
you
have
your
property
again
safe
and
sound
and
denbigh
said
he
felt
much
indebted
to
your
consideration
in
sending
them
said
emily
soothingly
as
she
took
them
off
with
her
beautiful
hands
ah
miss
emmy
said
the
steward
with
one
of
his
best
bows
that
noble
act
god
bless
him
then
holding
up
his
finger
significantly
the
fourteenth
codicil
to
master
will
and
peter
laid
his
finger
alongside
his
nose
as
he
nodded
his
head
in
silence
i
hope
the
thirteenth
contains
the
name
of
honest
peter
johnson
said
the
young
lady
who
felt
herself
uncommonly
well
pleased
with
the
steward
conversation
as
witness
miss
emmy
witness
to
all
but
god
forbid
said
the
steward
with
solemnity
i
should
ever
live
to
see
the
proving
of
them
no
miss
emmy
master
has
done
for
me
what
he
intended
while
i
had
youth
to
enjoy
it
i
am
rich
miss
emmy
good
three
hundred
a
year
emily
who
had
seldom
heard
so
long
a
speech
as
the
old
man
gratitude
drew
from
him
expressed
her
pleasure
at
hearing
it
and
shaking
him
kindly
by
the
hand
left
him
for
the
parlor
niece
said
benfield
having
scanned
the
party
closely
with
his
eyes
where
is
colonel
denbigh
colonel
egerton
you
mean
sir
interrupted
lady
moseley
no
my
lady
moseley
replied
her
uncle
with
great
formality
i
mean
colonel
denbigh
i
take
it
he
is
a
colonel
by
this
time
looking
expressively
at
the
baronet
and
who
is
fitter
to
be
a
colonel
or
a
general
than
a
man
who
is
not
afraid
of
gunpowder
colonels
must
have
been
scarce
in
your
youth
sir
cried
john
who
had
rather
a
mischievous
propensity
to
start
the
old
man
on
his
hobby
no
jackanapes
gentlemen
killed
one
another
then
although
they
did
not
torment
the
innocent
birds
honor
was
as
dear
to
a
gentleman
of
george
the
second
court
as
to
those
of
his
grandson
and
honesty
too
sirrah
ay
honesty
i
remember
when
we
were
in
there
was
not
a
man
of
doubtful
integrity
in
the
ministry
or
on
our
side
even
and
then
again
when
we
went
out
the
opposition
benches
were
filled
with
sterling
characters
making
a
parliament
that
was
correct
throughout
can
you
show
me
such
a
thing
at
this
day
chapter
xxii
a
few
days
after
the
arrival
of
the
moseleys
at
the
lodge
john
drove
his
sisters
to
the
little
village
of
l
which
at
that
time
was
thronged
with
an
unusual
number
of
visiters
it
had
among
other
fashionable
arrangements
for
the
accommodation
of
its
guests
one
of
those
circulators
of
good
and
evil
a
public
library
books
are
in
a
great
measure
the
instruments
of
controlling
the
opinions
of
a
nation
like
ours
they
are
an
engine
alike
powerful
to
save
or
to
destroy
it
can
not
be
denied
that
our
libraries
contain
as
many
volumes
of
the
latter
as
the
former
description
for
we
rank
amongst
the
latter
that
long
catalogue
of
idle
productions
which
if
they
produce
no
other
evil
lead
to
the
misspending
of
time
our
own
perhaps
included
but
we
can
not
refrain
expressing
our
regret
that
such
formidable
weapons
in
the
cause
of
morality
should
be
suffered
to
be
wielded
by
any
indifferent
or
mercenary
dealer
who
undoubtedly
will
consult
rather
the
public
tastes
than
the
private
good
the
evil
may
be
remediless
yet
we
love
to
express
our
sentiments
though
we
should
suggest
nothing
new
or
even
profitable
into
one
of
these
haunts
of
the
idle
then
john
moseley
entered
with
a
lovely
sister
leaning
on
either
arm
books
were
the
entertainers
of
jane
and
instructors
of
emily
sir
edward
was
fond
of
reading
of
a
certain
sort
that
which
required
no
great
depth
of
thought
or
labor
of
research
and
like
most
others
who
are
averse
to
contention
and
disposed
to
be
easily
satisfied
the
baronet
sometimes
found
he
had
harbored
opinions
on
things
not
exactly
reconcileable
with
the
truth
or
even
with
each
other
it
is
quite
as
dangerous
to
give
up
your
faculties
to
the
guidance
of
the
author
you
are
perusing
as
it
is
unprofitable
to
be
captiously
scrutinizing
every
syllable
he
may
happen
to
advance
and
sir
edward
was
if
anything
a
little
inclined
to
the
dangerous
propensity
unpleasant
sir
edward
moseley
never
was
lady
moseley
very
seldom
took
a
book
in
her
hand
her
opinions
were
established
to
her
own
satisfaction
on
all
important
points
and
on
the
minor
ones
she
made
it
a
rule
to
coincide
with
the
popular
feeling
jane
had
a
mind
more
active
than
her
father
and
more
brilliant
than
her
mother
and
if
she
had
not
imbibed
injurious
impressions
from
the
unlicensed
and
indiscriminate
reading
she
practised
it
was
more
owing
to
the
fortunate
circumstance
that
the
baronet
library
contained
nothing
extremely
offensive
to
a
pure
taste
nor
dangerous
to
good
morals
than
to
any
precaution
of
her
parents
against
the
deadly
the
irretrievable
injury
to
be
sustained
from
ungoverned
liberty
in
this
respect
to
a
female
mind
on
the
other
hand
wilson
had
inculcated
the
necessity
of
restraint
in
selecting
the
books
for
her
perusal
so
strenuously
on
her
niece
that
what
at
first
had
been
the
effects
of
obedience
and
submission
had
now
settled
into
taste
and
habit
and
emily
seldom
opened
a
book
unless
in
search
of
information
or
if
it
were
the
indulgence
of
a
less
commendable
spirit
it
was
an
indulgence
chastened
by
a
taste
and
judgment
that
lessened
the
danger
if
it
did
not
entirely
remove
it
the
room
was
filled
with
gentlemen
and
ladies
and
while
john
was
exchanging
his
greetings
with
several
of
the
neighboring
gentry
of
his
acquaintance
his
sisters
were
running
hastily
over
a
catalogue
of
the
books
kept
for
circulation
as
an
elderly
lady
of
foreign
accent
and
dress
entered
and
depositing
a
couple
of
religious
works
on
the
counter
she
inquired
for
the
remainder
of
the
set
the
peculiarity
of
her
idiom
and
her
proximity
to
the
sisters
caused
them
both
to
look
up
at
the
moment
and
to
the
surprise
of
jane
her
sister
uttered
a
slight
exclamation
of
pleasure
the
foreigner
was
attracted
by
the
sound
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
respectfully
curtsied
emily
advancing
kindly
offered
her
hand
and
the
usual
inquiries
after
each
other
welfare
succeeded
to
the
questions
asked
after
the
friend
of
the
matron
emily
learnt
with
some
surprise
and
no
less
satisfaction
that
she
resided
in
a
retired
cottage
about
five
miles
from
l
where
they
had
been
for
the
last
six
months
and
where
they
expected
to
remain
for
some
time
until
she
could
prevail
on
fitzgerald
to
return
to
spain
a
thing
now
there
was
peace
of
which
she
did
not
despair
after
asking
leave
to
call
on
them
in
their
retreat
and
exchanging
good
wishes
the
spanish
lady
withdrew
and
as
jane
had
made
her
selection
was
followed
immediately
by
john
moseley
and
his
sisters
emily
in
their
walk
home
acquainted
her
brother
that
the
companion
of
their
bath
incognita
had
been
at
the
library
and
that
for
the
first
time
she
had
learnt
that
their
young
acquaintance
was
or
had
been
married
and
her
name
john
listened
to
his
sister
with
the
interest
which
the
beautiful
spaniard
had
excited
at
the
time
they
first
met
and
laughingly
told
her
he
could
not
believe
their
unknown
friend
had
ever
been
a
wife
to
satisfy
this
doubt
and
to
gratify
a
wish
they
both
had
to
renew
their
acquaintance
with
the
foreigner
they
agreed
to
drive
to
the
cottage
the
following
morning
accompanied
by
wilson
and
jane
if
she
would
go
but
the
next
day
was
the
one
appointed
by
egerton
for
his
arrival
at
l
and
jane
under
a
pretence
of
writing
letters
declined
the
excursion
she
had
carefully
examined
the
papers
since
his
departure
had
seen
his
name
included
in
the
arrivals
at
london
and
at
a
later
day
had
read
an
account
of
the
review
by
the
of
the
regiment
to
which
he
belonged
he
had
never
written
to
any
of
her
friends
but
judging
from
her
own
feelings
she
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
he
would
be
as
punctual
as
love
could
make
him
wilson
listened
to
her
niece
account
of
the
unexpected
interview
in
the
library
with
pleasure
and
cheerfully
promised
to
accompany
them
in
their
morning
excursion
as
she
had
both
a
wish
to
alleviate
sorrow
and
a
desire
to
better
understand
the
character
of
this
accidental
acquaintance
of
emily
benfield
and
the
baronet
had
a
long
conversation
in
relation
to
denbigh
fortune
the
morning
after
their
arrival
and
the
old
man
was
loud
in
his
expression
of
dissatisfaction
at
the
youngster
pride
as
the
baronet
however
in
the
fulness
of
his
affection
and
simplicity
betrayed
to
his
uncle
his
expectation
of
a
union
between
denbigh
and
his
daughter
benfield
became
contented
with
this
reward
one
fit
he
thought
for
any
services
on
the
whole
it
was
best
as
he
was
to
marry
emmy
he
should
sell
out
of
the
army
and
as
there
would
be
an
election
soon
he
would
bring
him
into
parliament
yes
yes
it
did
a
man
so
much
good
to
sit
one
term
in
the
parliament
of
this
realm
to
study
human
nature
all
his
own
knowledge
in
that
way
was
raised
on
the
foundations
laid
in
the
house
to
this
sir
edward
cordially
assented
and
the
gentlemen
separated
happy
in
their
arrangements
to
advance
the
welfare
of
two
beings
they
so
sincerely
loved
although
the
care
and
wisdom
of
wilson
had
prohibited
the
admission
of
any
romantic
or
enthusiastic
expectations
of
happiness
into
the
dreams
of
her
charge
yet
the
buoyancy
of
health
of
hope
of
youth
of
innocence
had
elevated
emily
to
a
height
of
enjoyment
hitherto
unknown
to
her
usually
placid
and
disciplined
pleasures
denbigh
certainly
mingled
in
most
of
her
thoughts
both
of
the
past
and
the
future
and
she
stood
on
the
threshold
of
that
fantastic
edifice
in
which
jane
ordinarily
resided
emily
was
in
the
situation
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
to
a
young
female
christian
her
heart
her
affections
were
given
to
a
man
to
appearance
every
way
worthy
of
possessing
them
it
is
true
but
she
had
admitted
a
rival
in
her
love
to
her
maker
and
to
keep
those
feelings
distinct
to
bend
the
passions
in
due
submission
to
the
more
powerful
considerations
of
endless
duty
of
unbounded
gratitude
is
one
of
the
most
trying
struggles
of
christian
fortitude
we
are
much
more
apt
to
forget
our
god
in
prosperity
than
adversity
the
weakness
of
human
nature
drives
us
to
seek
assistance
in
distress
but
vanity
and
often
induce
us
to
imagine
we
control
the
happiness
we
only
enjoy
sir
edward
and
lady
moseley
could
see
nothing
in
the
prospect
of
the
future
but
lives
of
peace
and
contentment
for
their
children
clara
was
happily
settled
and
her
sisters
were
on
the
eve
of
making
connexions
with
men
of
family
condition
and
certain
character
what
more
could
be
done
for
them
they
must
like
other
people
take
their
chances
in
the
lottery
of
life
they
could
only
hope
and
pray
for
their
prosperity
and
this
they
did
with
great
sincerity
not
so
wilson
she
had
guarded
the
invaluable
charge
intrusted
to
her
keeping
with
too
much
assiduity
too
keen
an
interest
too
just
a
sense
of
the
awful
responsibility
she
had
undertaken
to
desert
her
post
at
the
moment
watchfulness
was
most
required
by
a
temperate
but
firm
and
conversation
she
kept
alive
the
sense
of
her
real
condition
in
her
niece
and
labored
hard
to
prevent
the
blandishments
of
life
from
supplanting
the
lively
hope
of
enjoying
another
existence
she
endeavored
by
her
pious
example
her
prayers
and
her
judicious
allusions
to
keep
the
passion
of
love
in
the
breast
of
emily
secondary
to
the
more
important
object
of
her
creation
and
by
the
aid
of
a
kind
and
almighty
providence
her
labors
though
arduous
were
crowned
with
success
as
the
family
were
seated
round
the
table
after
dinner
on
the
day
of
their
walk
to
the
library
john
moseley
awakening
from
a
reverie
exclaimed
suddenly
which
do
you
think
the
handsomest
emily
grace
chatterton
or
miss
fitzgerald
emily
laughed
as
she
answered
grace
certainly
do
you
not
think
so
brother
yes
on
the
whole
but
do
you
think
grace
looks
like
her
mother
at
times
oh
no
she
is
the
image
of
chatterton
she
is
very
like
yourself
emmy
dear
said
benfield
who
was
listening
to
their
conversation
me
dear
uncle
i
have
never
heard
it
remarked
before
yes
yes
she
is
as
much
like
you
as
she
can
stare
i
never
saw
as
great
a
resemblance
excepting
between
you
and
lady
juliana
lady
juliana
emmy
was
a
beauty
in
her
day
very
like
her
uncle
old
admiral
griffin
you
ca
remember
the
admiral
he
lost
an
eye
in
a
battle
with
the
dutch
and
part
of
his
cheek
in
a
frigate
when
a
young
man
fighting
the
dons
oh
he
was
a
pleasant
old
gentleman
many
a
guinea
has
he
given
me
when
i
was
a
boy
at
school
and
he
looked
like
grace
chatterton
uncle
did
he
asked
john
innocently
no
sir
he
did
not
who
said
he
looked
like
grace
chatterton
jackanapes
why
i
thought
you
made
it
out
sir
but
perhaps
it
was
the
description
that
deceived
me
his
eye
and
cheek
uncle
did
lord
gosford
leave
children
uncle
inquired
emily
throwing
a
look
of
reproach
at
john
no
emmy
dear
his
only
child
a
son
died
at
school
i
shall
never
forget
the
grief
of
poor
lady
juliana
she
postponed
a
visit
to
bath
three
weeks
on
account
of
it
a
gentleman
who
was
paying
his
addresses
to
her
at
the
time
offered
then
and
was
refused
indeed
her
denial
raised
such
an
admiration
of
her
in
the
men
that
immediately
after
the
death
of
young
lord
dayton
no
less
than
seven
gentlemen
offered
and
were
refused
in
one
week
i
heard
lady
juliana
say
that
what
between
lawyers
and
suitors
she
had
not
a
moment
peace
lawyers
cried
sir
edward
what
had
she
to
do
with
lawyers
why
sir
edward
six
thousand
a
year
fell
to
her
by
the
death
of
her
nephew
and
there
were
trustees
and
deeds
to
be
made
out
poor
young
woman
she
was
so
affected
emmy
i
do
think
she
went
out
for
a
the
time
at
home
reading
papers
and
attending
to
her
important
concerns
oh
she
was
a
woman
of
taste
her
mourning
and
liveries
and
new
carriage
were
more
admired
than
those
of
any
one
about
the
court
yes
yes
the
title
is
extinct
i
know
of
none
of
the
name
now
the
earl
did
not
survive
his
loss
but
six
years
and
the
countess
died
hearted
about
a
twelvemonth
before
him
and
lady
juliana
uncle
inquired
john
what
became
of
her
did
she
marry
the
old
man
helped
himself
to
a
glass
of
wine
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
see
if
peter
was
at
hand
peter
who
had
been
originally
butler
and
had
made
it
a
condition
of
his
preferment
that
whenever
there
was
company
he
should
be
allowed
to
preside
at
the
sideboard
was
now
at
his
station
benfield
seeing
his
old
friend
near
him
ventured
to
talk
on
a
subject
he
seldom
trusted
himself
with
in
company
why
yes
yes
she
did
marry
it
true
although
she
did
tell
me
she
intended
to
die
a
maid
but
hem
i
suppose
hem
it
was
compassion
for
the
old
viscount
who
often
said
he
could
not
live
without
her
and
then
it
gave
her
the
power
of
doing
so
much
good
a
jointure
of
five
thousand
a
year
added
to
her
own
income
yet
hem
i
do
confess
i
did
not
think
she
would
have
chosen
such
an
old
and
infirm
man
but
peter
give
me
a
glass
of
claret
peter
handed
the
claret
and
the
old
man
proceeded
they
say
he
was
very
cross
to
her
and
that
no
doubt
must
have
made
her
unhappy
she
was
so
very
how
much
longer
the
old
gentleman
would
have
continued
in
this
strain
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
he
was
interrupted
by
the
opening
of
the
parlor
door
and
the
sudden
appearance
on
its
threshold
of
denbigh
every
countenance
glowed
with
pleasure
at
this
unexpected
return
of
their
favorite
and
but
for
the
prudent
caution
of
wilson
in
handing
a
glass
of
water
to
her
niece
the
surprise
might
have
proved
too
much
for
her
the
salutations
of
denbigh
were
returned
by
the
different
members
of
the
family
with
a
cordiality
that
must
have
told
him
how
much
he
was
valued
by
all
its
branches
and
after
briefly
informing
them
that
his
review
was
over
and
that
he
had
thrown
himself
into
a
chaise
and
travelled
post
until
he
had
rejoined
them
he
took
his
seat
by
benfield
who
received
him
with
a
marked
preference
exceeding
that
which
he
had
shown
to
any
man
who
had
ever
entered
his
doors
lord
gosford
himself
not
excepted
peter
removed
from
his
station
behind
his
master
chair
to
one
where
he
could
face
the
new
comer
and
after
wiping
his
eyes
until
they
filled
so
rapidly
with
water
that
at
last
he
was
noticed
by
the
delighted
john
to
put
on
the
identical
goggles
which
his
care
had
provided
for
denbigh
in
his
illness
his
laugh
drew
the
attention
of
the
rest
to
the
honest
steward
and
when
denbigh
was
told
this
was
benfield
ambassador
to
the
hall
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
taking
the
old
man
by
the
hand
kindly
thanked
him
for
his
thoughtful
consideration
for
his
weak
eyes
peter
took
the
offered
hand
in
both
his
own
and
after
making
one
or
two
unsuccessful
efforts
to
speak
he
uttered
thank
you
thank
you
may
heaven
bless
you
and
burst
into
tears
this
stopped
the
laugh
and
john
followed
the
steward
from
the
room
while
his
master
exclaimed
wiping
his
eyes
kind
and
condescending
just
such
another
as
my
old
friend
the
earl
of
gosford
chapter
xxiii
at
the
appointed
hour
the
carriage
of
wilson
was
ready
to
convey
herself
and
niece
to
the
cottage
of
fitzgerald
john
was
left
behind
under
the
pretence
of
keeping
denbigh
company
in
his
morning
avocations
but
really
because
wilson
doubted
the
propriety
of
his
becoming
a
visiting
acquaintance
at
the
house
tenanted
as
the
cottage
was
represented
to
be
john
was
too
fond
of
his
friend
to
make
any
serious
objections
and
was
satisfied
for
the
present
by
sending
his
compliments
and
requesting
his
sister
to
ask
permission
for
him
to
call
in
one
of
his
morning
excursions
in
order
to
pay
his
personal
respects
they
found
the
cottage
a
beautiful
and
genteel
though
a
very
small
and
retired
dwelling
almost
hid
by
the
trees
and
shrubs
which
surrounded
it
and
its
mistress
in
its
little
veranda
expecting
the
arrival
of
emily
fitzgerald
was
a
spaniard
under
twenty
of
a
melancholy
yet
highly
interesting
countenance
her
manners
were
soft
and
retiring
but
evidently
bore
the
impression
of
good
company
if
not
of
high
life
she
was
extremely
pleased
with
this
renewal
of
attention
on
the
part
of
emily
and
expressed
her
gratitude
to
both
ladies
for
their
kindness
in
seeking
her
out
in
her
solitude
she
presented
her
more
matronly
companion
to
them
by
the
name
of
donna
lorenza
and
as
nothing
but
good
feeling
prevailed
and
useless
ceremony
was
banished
the
little
party
were
soon
on
terms
of
friendly
intercourse
the
young
widow
for
such
her
dress
indicated
her
to
be
did
the
honors
of
her
house
with
graceful
ease
and
conducted
her
visiters
into
her
little
grounds
which
together
the
cottage
gave
evident
proofs
of
the
taste
and
elegance
of
its
occupant
the
establishment
she
supported
she
represented
as
very
small
two
women
and
an
aged
man
servant
with
occasionally
a
laborer
for
her
garden
and
shrubbery
they
never
visited
it
was
a
resolution
she
had
made
on
fixing
her
residence
here
but
if
wilson
and
miss
moseley
would
forgive
the
rudeness
of
not
returning
their
call
nothing
would
give
her
more
satisfaction
than
a
frequent
renewal
of
their
visits
wilson
took
so
deep
an
interest
in
the
misfortunes
of
this
young
female
and
was
so
much
pleased
with
the
modest
resignation
of
her
manner
that
it
required
little
persuasion
on
the
part
of
the
recluse
to
obtain
a
promise
of
soon
repeating
her
visit
emily
mentioned
the
request
of
john
and
fitzgerald
received
it
with
a
mournful
smile
as
she
replied
that
moseley
had
laid
her
under
such
an
obligation
in
their
first
interview
she
could
not
deny
herself
the
pleasure
of
again
thanking
him
for
it
but
she
must
be
excused
if
she
desired
they
would
limit
their
attendants
to
him
as
there
was
but
one
gentleman
in
england
whose
visits
she
admitted
and
it
was
seldom
indeed
he
called
he
had
seen
her
but
once
since
she
had
resided
in
norfolk
after
giving
a
promise
not
to
suffer
any
one
else
to
accompany
them
and
promising
an
early
call
again
our
ladies
returned
to
benfield
lodge
in
season
to
dress
for
dinner
on
entering
the
they
found
the
elegant
person
of
colonel
egerton
leaning
on
the
back
of
jane
chair
he
had
arrived
during
their
absence
and
immediately
sought
the
baronet
family
his
reception
if
not
as
warm
as
that
given
to
denbigh
was
cordial
from
all
but
the
master
of
the
house
and
even
he
was
in
such
spirits
by
the
company
around
him
and
the
prospects
of
emily
marriage
which
he
considered
as
settled
that
he
forced
himself
to
an
appearance
of
good
will
he
did
not
feel
colonel
egerton
was
either
deceived
by
his
manner
or
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
to
discover
his
suspicion
and
everything
in
consequence
was
very
harmoniously
if
not
sincerely
conducted
between
them
lady
moseley
was
completely
happy
if
she
had
the
least
doubts
before
as
to
the
intentions
of
egerton
they
were
now
removed
his
journey
to
that
unfashionable
was
owing
to
his
passion
and
however
she
might
at
times
have
doubted
as
to
sir
edgar
heir
denbigh
she
thought
a
man
of
too
little
consequence
in
the
world
to
make
it
possible
he
would
neglect
to
profit
by
his
situation
in
the
family
of
sir
edward
moseley
she
was
satisfied
with
both
connexions
benfield
had
told
her
general
sir
frederic
denbigh
was
nearly
allied
to
the
duke
of
derwent
and
denbigh
had
said
the
general
was
his
grandfather
wealth
she
knew
emily
would
possess
from
both
her
uncle
and
aunt
and
the
services
of
the
gentleman
had
their
due
weight
upon
the
feelings
of
the
affectionate
mother
the
greatest
of
her
maternal
anxieties
was
removed
and
she
looked
forward
to
the
peaceful
enjoyment
of
the
remnant
of
her
days
in
the
bosom
of
her
descendants
john
the
heir
of
a
baronetcy
and
pounds
a
year
might
suit
himself
and
grace
chatterton
she
thought
would
be
likely
to
prove
the
future
lady
moseley
sir
edward
without
entering
so
deeply
into
anticipations
of
the
future
as
his
wife
experienced
an
equal
degree
of
contentment
and
it
would
have
been
a
difficult
task
to
discover
in
the
island
a
roof
under
which
there
resided
at
the
moment
more
happy
countenances
than
at
benfield
lodge
for
as
its
master
had
insisted
on
denbigh
becoming
an
inmate
he
was
obliged
to
extend
his
hospitality
in
an
equal
degree
to
colonel
egerton
indeed
the
subject
had
been
fully
canvassed
between
him
and
peter
the
morning
of
his
arrival
and
was
near
being
decided
against
his
admission
when
the
steward
who
had
picked
up
all
the
incidents
of
the
arbor
scene
from
the
servants
and
of
course
with
many
exaggerations
mentioned
to
his
master
that
the
colonel
was
very
active
and
that
he
even
contrived
to
bring
water
to
revive
miss
emmy
a
great
distance
in
the
hat
of
captain
jarvis
which
was
full
of
holes
john
having
blown
it
off
the
head
of
the
captain
without
hurting
a
hair
in
firing
at
a
woodcock
this
mollified
the
master
a
little
and
he
agreed
to
suspend
his
decision
for
further
observation
at
dinner
the
colonel
happening
to
admire
the
really
handsome
face
of
lord
gosford
as
delineated
by
sir
joshua
reynolds
which
graced
the
room
of
benfield
lodge
its
master
in
a
moment
of
unusual
kindness
gave
the
invitation
it
was
politely
accepted
and
the
colonel
at
once
domesticated
the
face
of
john
moseley
alone
at
times
exhibited
evidences
of
care
and
thought
and
at
such
moments
it
might
be
a
subject
of
doubt
whether
he
thought
the
most
of
grace
chatterton
or
her
mother
if
the
latter
the
former
was
sure
to
lose
ground
in
his
estimation
a
serious
misfortune
to
john
not
to
be
able
to
love
grace
without
alloy
his
letters
from
her
brother
mentioned
his
being
still
at
denbigh
castle
in
westmoreland
the
seat
of
his
friend
the
duke
of
derwent
and
john
thought
one
or
two
of
his
encomiums
on
lady
harriet
denbigh
the
sister
of
his
grace
augured
that
the
unkindness
of
emily
might
in
time
be
forgotten
the
dowager
and
her
daughters
were
at
the
seat
of
a
maiden
aunt
in
yorkshire
where
as
john
knew
no
male
animal
was
allowed
admittance
he
was
tolerably
easy
at
the
disposition
of
things
nothing
but
he
knew
would
induce
the
dowager
to
submit
to
such
a
banishment
from
the
other
sex
but
that
was
so
preferable
to
hunting
he
was
satisfied
i
wish
said
john
mentally
as
he
finished
the
perusal
of
his
letter
mother
chatterton
would
get
married
herself
and
she
might
let
kate
and
grace
manage
for
themselves
kate
would
do
very
well
i
dare
say
and
how
would
grace
make
out
john
sighed
and
whistled
for
dido
and
rover
in
the
manners
of
colonel
egerton
there
was
the
same
general
disposition
to
please
and
the
same
unremitted
attention
to
the
wishes
and
amusements
of
jane
they
had
renewed
their
poetical
investigations
and
jane
eagerly
encouraged
a
taste
which
afforded
her
delicacy
some
little
coloring
for
the
indulgence
of
an
association
different
from
the
real
truth
and
which
in
her
estimation
was
necessary
to
her
happiness
wilson
thought
the
distance
between
the
two
suitors
for
the
favor
of
her
nieces
was
if
anything
increased
by
their
short
separation
and
particularly
noticed
on
the
part
of
the
colonel
an
aversion
to
denbigh
that
at
times
painfully
alarmed
by
exciting
apprehensions
for
the
future
happiness
of
the
precious
treasure
she
had
prepared
herself
to
yield
to
his
solicitations
whenever
properly
proffered
in
the
intercourse
between
emily
and
her
preserver
as
there
was
nothing
to
condemn
so
there
was
much
to
admire
the
attentions
of
denbigh
were
pointed
although
less
exclusive
than
those
of
the
colonel
and
the
aunt
was
pleased
to
observe
that
if
the
manners
of
egerton
had
more
of
the
gloss
of
life
those
of
denbigh
were
certainly
distinguished
by
a
more
finished
delicacy
and
propriety
the
one
appeared
the
influence
of
custom
and
association
with
a
tincture
of
artifice
the
other
benevolence
with
a
just
perception
of
what
was
due
to
others
and
with
an
air
of
sincerity
when
speaking
of
sentiments
and
principles
that
was
particularly
pleasing
to
the
watchful
widow
at
times
however
she
could
not
but
observe
an
air
of
restraint
if
not
of
awkwardness
about
him
that
was
a
little
surprising
it
was
most
observable
in
mixed
society
and
once
or
twice
her
imagination
pictured
his
sensations
into
something
like
alarm
these
unpleasant
interruptions
to
her
admiration
were
soon
forgotten
in
her
just
appreciation
of
the
more
solid
parts
of
his
character
which
appeared
literally
to
be
unexceptionable
and
when
momentary
uneasiness
would
steal
over
her
the
remembrance
of
the
opinion
of
ives
his
behavior
with
jarvis
his
charity
and
chiefly
his
devotion
to
her
niece
would
not
fail
to
drive
the
disagreeable
thoughts
from
her
mind
emily
herself
moved
about
the
image
of
joy
and
innocence
if
denbigh
were
near
her
she
was
happy
if
absent
she
suffered
no
uneasiness
her
feelings
were
so
ardent
and
yet
so
pure
that
jealousy
had
no
admission
perhaps
no
circumstances
existed
to
excite
this
usual
attendant
of
the
passion
but
as
the
heart
of
emily
was
more
enchained
than
her
imagination
her
affections
were
not
of
the
restless
nature
of
ordinary
attachments
though
more
dangerous
to
her
peace
of
mind
in
the
event
of
an
unfortunate
issue
with
denbigh
she
never
walked
or
rode
alone
he
had
never
made
the
request
and
her
delicacy
would
have
shrunk
from
such
an
open
manifestation
of
her
preference
but
he
read
to
her
and
her
aunt
he
accompanied
them
in
their
little
excursions
and
once
or
twice
john
noticed
that
she
took
the
offered
hand
of
denbigh
to
assist
her
over
any
little
impediment
in
their
course
instead
of
her
usual
unobtrusive
custom
of
taking
his
arm
on
such
occasions
well
miss
emily
thought
john
you
appear
to
have
chosen
another
favorite
on
her
doing
this
three
times
in
succession
in
one
of
their
walks
how
strange
it
is
women
will
quit
their
natural
friends
for
a
face
they
have
hardly
seen
john
forgot
his
own
there
is
no
danger
dear
grace
when
his
sister
was
almost
dead
with
apprehension
but
john
loved
emily
too
well
to
witness
her
preference
of
another
with
satisfaction
even
though
denbigh
was
the
favorite
a
feeling
which
soon
wore
away
however
by
dint
of
custom
and
reflection
benfield
had
taken
it
into
his
head
that
if
the
wedding
of
emily
could
be
solemnized
while
the
family
was
at
the
lodge
it
would
render
him
the
happiest
of
men
and
how
to
compass
this
object
was
the
occupation
of
a
whole
morning
contemplation
happily
for
blushes
the
old
gentleman
harbored
the
most
fastidious
notions
of
female
delicacy
and
never
in
conversation
made
the
most
distant
allusion
to
the
expected
connexion
he
therefore
in
conformity
with
these
feelings
could
do
nothing
openly
all
must
be
the
effect
of
management
and
as
he
thought
peter
one
of
the
best
contrivers
in
the
world
to
his
ingenuity
he
determined
to
refer
the
arrangement
the
bell
rang
send
johnson
to
me
david
in
a
few
minutes
the
drab
coat
and
blue
yarn
stockings
entered
his
with
the
body
of
peter
johnson
snugly
cased
within
them
peter
commenced
benfield
pointing
kindly
to
a
chair
which
the
steward
respectfully
declined
i
suppose
you
know
that
denbigh
the
grandson
of
general
denbigh
who
was
in
parliament
with
me
is
about
to
marry
my
little
emmy
peter
smiled
as
he
bowed
an
assent
now
peter
a
wedding
would
of
all
things
make
me
most
happy
that
is
to
have
it
here
in
the
lodge
it
would
remind
me
so
much
of
the
marriage
of
lord
gosford
and
the
bridemaids
i
wish
your
opinion
how
to
bring
it
about
before
they
leave
us
sir
edward
and
anne
decline
interfering
and
wilson
i
am
afraid
to
speak
to
on
the
subject
peter
was
not
a
little
alarmed
by
this
sudden
requisition
on
his
inventive
faculties
especially
as
a
lady
was
in
the
case
but
as
he
prided
himself
on
serving
his
master
and
loved
the
hilarity
of
a
wedding
in
his
heart
he
cogitated
for
some
time
in
silence
when
having
thought
a
preliminary
question
or
two
necessary
he
broke
it
with
saying
everything
i
suppose
master
is
settled
between
the
young
people
everything
i
take
it
peter
and
sir
edward
and
my
lady
willing
perfectly
willing
and
madam
wilson
sir
willing
peter
willing
and
john
and
miss
jane
all
willing
the
whole
family
is
willing
to
the
best
of
my
belief
there
is
the
rev
ives
and
ives
master
they
wish
it
i
know
do
you
think
they
wish
others
as
happy
as
themselves
peter
no
doubt
they
do
master
well
then
as
everybody
is
willing
and
the
young
people
agreeable
the
only
thing
to
be
done
sir
is
is
what
peter
exclaimed
his
impatient
master
observing
him
to
hesitate
why
sir
to
send
for
the
priest
i
take
it
pshaw
peter
johnson
i
know
that
myself
replied
the
dissatisfied
old
man
can
not
you
help
me
to
a
better
plan
why
master
said
peter
i
would
have
done
as
well
for
miss
emmy
and
your
honor
as
i
would
have
done
for
myself
now
sir
when
i
courted
patty
steele
your
honor
in
the
year
of
our
lord
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
i
should
have
been
married
but
for
one
difficulty
which
your
honor
says
is
removed
in
the
case
of
miss
emmy
what
was
that
peter
asked
his
master
in
a
tender
tone
she
was
willing
sir
very
well
poor
peter
replied
benfield
mildly
you
may
go
and
the
steward
bowing
low
withdrew
the
similarity
of
their
fortunes
in
love
was
a
strong
link
in
the
sympathies
which
bound
the
master
and
man
together
and
the
former
never
failed
to
be
softened
by
an
allusion
to
patty
the
want
of
tact
in
the
man
on
the
present
occasion
after
much
reflection
was
attributed
by
his
master
to
the
fact
that
peter
had
never
sat
in
parliament
chapter
xxiv
wilson
and
emily
in
the
fortnight
they
had
been
at
benfield
lodge
paid
frequent
and
long
visits
to
the
cottage
and
each
succeeding
interview
left
a
more
favorable
impression
of
the
character
of
its
mistress
and
a
greater
certainty
that
she
was
unfortunate
the
latter
however
alluded
very
slightly
to
her
situation
or
former
life
she
was
a
protestant
to
the
great
surprise
of
wilson
and
one
that
misery
had
made
nearly
acquainted
with
the
religion
she
professed
their
conversations
chiefly
turned
on
the
customs
of
her
own
as
contrasted
with
those
of
her
adopted
country
or
in
a
pleasant
exchange
of
opinions
which
the
ladies
possessed
in
complete
unison
one
morning
john
had
accompanied
them
and
been
admitted
fitzgerald
receiving
him
with
the
frankness
of
an
old
acquaintance
though
with
the
reserve
of
a
spanish
lady
his
visits
were
permitted
under
the
direction
of
his
aunt
but
no
others
of
the
gentlemen
were
included
amongst
her
guests
wilson
had
casually
mentioned
in
the
absence
of
her
niece
the
interposition
of
denbigh
between
her
and
death
and
fitzgerald
was
so
much
pleased
at
the
noble
conduct
of
the
gentleman
as
to
express
a
desire
to
see
him
but
the
impressions
of
the
moment
appeared
to
have
died
away
a
nothing
more
was
said
by
either
lady
on
the
subject
and
it
was
apparently
forgotten
fitzgerald
was
found
one
morning
weeping
over
a
letter
she
held
in
her
hand
and
the
donna
lorenza
was
endeavoring
to
console
her
the
situation
of
this
latter
lady
was
somewhat
doubtful
she
appeared
neither
wholly
a
friend
nor
a
menial
in
the
manners
of
the
two
there
was
a
striking
difference
although
the
donna
was
not
vulgar
she
was
far
from
possessing
the
polish
of
her
more
juvenile
friend
and
wilson
considered
her
to
be
in
a
station
between
that
of
a
housekeeper
and
that
of
a
companion
after
hoping
that
no
unpleasant
intelligence
occasioned
the
distress
they
witnessed
the
ladies
were
delicately
about
to
take
their
leave
when
fitzgerald
entreated
them
to
remain
your
kind
attention
to
me
dear
madam
and
the
goodness
of
miss
moseley
give
you
a
claim
to
know
more
of
the
unfortunate
being
your
sympathy
has
so
greatly
assisted
to
attain
her
peace
of
mind
this
letter
is
from
the
gentleman
of
whom
you
have
heard
me
speak
as
once
visiting
me
and
though
it
has
struck
me
with
unusual
force
it
contains
no
more
than
i
expected
to
hear
perhaps
no
more
than
i
deserve
to
hear
i
hope
your
friend
has
not
been
unnecessarily
harsh
severity
is
not
the
best
way
always
of
effecting
repentance
and
i
feel
certain
that
you
my
young
friend
can
have
been
guilty
of
no
offence
that
does
not
rather
require
gentle
than
stern
reproof
said
wilson
i
thank
you
dear
madam
for
your
indulgent
opinion
of
me
but
although
i
have
suffered
much
i
am
willing
to
confess
it
is
a
merited
punishment
you
are
however
mistaken
as
to
the
source
of
my
present
sorrow
lord
pendennyss
is
the
cause
of
grief
i
believe
to
no
one
much
less
to
me
lord
pendennyss
exclaimed
emily
in
surprise
unconsciously
looking
at
her
aunt
pendennyss
reiterated
wilson
with
animation
and
is
he
your
friend
too
yes
madam
to
his
lordship
i
owe
everything
honor
comfort
religion
and
even
life
itself
wilson
cheek
glowed
with
an
unusual
color
at
this
discovery
of
another
act
of
benevolence
and
virtue
in
a
young
nobleman
whose
character
she
had
so
long
admired
and
whose
person
she
had
in
vain
wished
to
meet
you
know
the
earl
then
inquired
fitzgerald
by
reputation
only
my
dear
said
wilson
but
that
is
enough
to
convince
me
a
friend
of
his
must
be
a
worthy
character
if
anything
were
wanting
to
make
us
your
friends
the
conversation
was
continued
for
some
time
and
fitzgerald
saying
she
did
not
feel
equal
just
then
to
the
undertaking
but
the
next
day
if
they
would
honor
her
with
another
call
she
would
make
them
acquainted
with
the
incidents
of
her
life
and
the
reasons
she
had
for
speaking
in
such
terms
of
lord
pendennyss
the
promise
to
see
her
was
cheerfully
made
by
wilson
and
her
confidence
accepted
not
from
a
desire
to
gratify
an
idle
curiosity
but
a
belief
that
it
was
necessary
to
probe
a
wound
to
cure
it
and
a
correct
opinion
that
she
would
be
a
better
adviser
for
a
young
and
lovely
woman
than
even
pendennyss
for
the
donna
lorenza
she
could
hardly
consider
in
a
capacity
to
offer
advice
much
less
dictation
they
then
took
their
leave
and
emily
during
their
ride
broke
the
silence
with
exclaiming
wherever
we
hear
of
lord
pendennyss
aunt
we
hear
of
him
favorably
a
certain
sign
my
dear
he
is
deserving
of
it
there
is
hardly
any
man
who
has
not
his
enemies
and
those
are
seldom
just
but
we
have
met
with
none
of
the
earl
yet
fifty
thousand
a
year
will
make
many
friends
observed
emily
shaking
her
head
doubtless
my
love
or
as
many
enemies
but
honor
life
and
religion
my
child
are
debts
not
owing
to
money
in
this
country
at
least
to
this
remark
emily
assented
and
after
expressing
her
own
admiration
of
the
character
of
the
young
nobleman
she
dropped
into
a
reverie
how
many
of
his
virtues
she
identified
with
the
person
of
denbigh
it
is
not
just
now
our
task
to
enumerate
but
judges
of
human
nature
may
easily
determine
and
that
too
without
having
sat
in
the
parliament
of
this
realm
the
morning
this
conversation
occurred
at
the
cottage
and
jarvis
with
their
daughters
made
their
unexpected
appearance
at
l
the
arrival
of
a
and
four
with
a
gig
was
an
event
soon
circulated
through
the
little
village
and
the
names
of
its
owners
reached
the
lodge
just
as
jane
had
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
by
the
colonel
to
take
her
first
walk
with
him
unaccompanied
by
a
third
person
walking
is
much
more
propitious
to
declarations
than
riding
and
whether
it
was
premeditated
on
the
part
of
the
colonel
or
not
or
whether
he
was
afraid
that
jarvis
or
some
one
else
would
interfere
he
availed
himself
of
this
opportunity
and
had
hardly
got
out
of
hearing
of
her
brother
and
denbigh
before
he
made
jane
an
explicit
offer
of
his
hand
the
surprise
was
so
great
that
some
time
elapsed
before
the
distressed
girl
could
reply
this
she
however
at
length
did
but
incoherently
she
referred
him
to
her
parents
as
the
arbiters
of
her
fate
well
knowing
that
her
wishes
had
long
been
those
of
her
father
and
mother
with
this
the
colonel
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
for
the
present
but
their
walk
had
not
ended
before
he
gradually
drew
from
the
confiding
girl
an
acknowledgment
that
should
her
parents
decline
his
offer
she
would
be
very
little
less
miserable
than
himself
indeed
the
most
tenacious
lover
might
have
been
content
with
the
proofs
of
regard
that
jane
unused
to
control
her
feelings
allowed
herself
to
manifest
on
this
occasion
egerton
was
in
raptures
a
life
devoted
to
her
would
never
half
repay
her
condescension
and
as
their
confidence
increased
with
their
walk
jane
the
lodge
with
a
degree
of
happiness
in
her
heart
she
had
never
before
experienced
the
much
dreaded
declaration
her
own
distressing
acknowledgements
were
made
and
nothing
farther
remained
but
to
live
and
be
happy
she
flew
into
the
arms
of
her
mother
and
hiding
her
blushes
in
her
bosom
acquainted
her
with
the
colonel
offer
and
her
own
wishes
lady
moseley
who
was
prepared
for
such
a
communication
and
had
rather
wondered
at
its
tardiness
kissed
her
daughter
affectionately
as
she
promised
to
speak
to
her
father
and
to
obtain
his
approbation
but
she
added
with
a
degree
of
formality
and
caution
which
had
better
preceded
than
have
followed
the
courtship
we
must
make
the
usual
inquiries
my
child
into
the
fitness
of
colonel
egerton
as
a
husband
for
our
daughter
once
assured
of
that
you
have
nothing
to
fear
the
baronet
was
requested
to
grant
an
audience
to
colonel
egerton
who
now
appeared
as
determined
to
expedite
things
as
he
had
been
dilatory
before
on
meeting
sir
edward
he
made
known
his
pretensions
and
hopes
the
father
who
had
been
previously
notified
by
his
wife
of
what
was
forthcoming
gave
a
general
answer
similar
to
the
speech
of
the
mother
and
the
colonel
bowed
in
acquiescence
in
the
evening
the
jarvis
family
favored
the
inhabitants
of
the
lodge
with
a
visit
and
wilson
was
struck
with
the
singularity
of
their
reception
of
the
colonel
miss
jarvis
especially
was
rude
to
both
him
and
jane
and
it
struck
all
who
witnessed
it
as
a
burst
of
jealous
feeling
for
disappointed
hopes
but
to
no
one
excepting
wilson
did
it
occur
that
the
conduct
of
the
gentleman
could
be
at
all
implicated
in
the
transaction
benfield
was
happy
to
see
under
his
roof
again
the
best
of
the
trio
of
jarvises
he
had
known
and
something
like
sociability
prevailed
there
was
to
be
a
ball
miss
jarvis
remarked
at
l
the
following
day
which
would
help
to
enliven
the
scene
a
little
especially
as
there
were
a
couple
of
frigates
at
anchor
a
few
miles
off
and
the
officers
were
expected
to
join
the
party
this
intelligence
had
but
little
effect
on
the
ladies
of
the
moseley
family
yet
as
their
uncle
desired
that
out
of
respect
to
his
neighbors
if
invited
they
would
go
they
cheerfully
assented
during
the
evening
wilson
observed
egerton
in
familiar
conversation
with
miss
jarvis
and
as
she
had
been
notified
of
his
situation
with
respect
to
jane
she
determined
to
watch
narrowly
into
the
causes
of
so
singular
a
change
of
deportment
in
the
young
lady
jarvis
retained
her
respect
for
the
colonel
in
full
force
and
called
out
to
him
across
the
room
a
few
minutes
before
she
departed
well
colonel
i
am
happy
to
tell
you
i
have
heard
very
lately
from
your
uncle
sir
edgar
indeed
madam
replied
the
colonel
starting
he
was
well
i
hope
very
well
the
day
before
yesterday
his
neighbor
old
holt
is
a
lodger
in
the
same
house
with
us
at
l
and
as
i
thought
you
would
like
to
hear
i
made
particular
inquiries
about
the
baronet
the
word
baronet
was
pronounced
with
emphasis
and
a
look
of
triumph
as
if
it
would
say
you
see
we
have
baronets
as
well
as
you
as
no
answer
was
made
by
egerton
excepting
an
acknowledging
bow
the
merchant
and
his
family
departed
well
john
cried
emily
with
a
smile
we
have
heard
more
good
of
our
trusty
and
cousin
the
earl
of
pendennyss
indeed
exclaimed
her
brother
you
must
keep
emily
for
his
lordship
positively
aunt
she
is
almost
as
great
an
admirer
of
him
as
yourself
i
apprehend
it
is
necessary
she
should
be
quite
as
much
so
to
become
his
wife
said
wilson
really
said
emily
more
gravely
if
all
one
hears
of
him
be
true
or
even
half
it
would
be
no
difficult
task
to
admire
him
denbigh
was
standing
leaning
on
the
back
of
a
chair
in
situation
where
he
could
view
the
animated
countenance
of
emily
as
she
spoke
and
wilson
noticed
an
uneasiness
and
a
changing
of
color
in
him
that
appeared
uncommon
from
so
trifling
a
cause
is
it
possible
she
thought
denbigh
can
harbor
so
mean
a
passion
as
envy
he
walked
away
as
if
unwilling
to
hear
more
and
appeared
much
engrossed
with
his
own
reflections
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
there
were
moments
of
doubting
which
crossed
the
mind
of
wilson
with
a
keenness
of
apprehension
proportionate
to
her
deep
interest
in
emily
with
respect
to
certain
traits
in
the
character
of
denbigh
and
this
what
she
thought
a
display
of
unworthy
feeling
was
one
of
them
in
the
course
of
the
evening
the
cards
for
the
expected
ball
arrived
and
were
accepted
as
this
new
arrangement
for
the
morrow
interfered
with
their
intended
visit
to
fitzgerald
a
servant
was
sent
with
a
note
of
explanation
in
the
morning
and
a
request
that
on
the
following
day
the
promised
communication
might
be
made
to
this
arrangement
the
recluse
assented
and
emily
prepared
for
the
ball
with
a
melancholy
recollection
of
the
consequences
which
grew
out
of
the
last
she
had
attended
melancholy
at
the
fate
of
digby
and
pleasure
at
the
principles
manifested
by
denbigh
on
the
occasion
the
latter
however
with
a
smile
excused
himself
from
being
of
the
party
telling
emily
he
was
so
awkward
that
he
feared
some
unpleasant
consequences
to
himself
or
his
friends
would
arise
from
his
inadvertencies
did
he
venture
again
with
her
into
such
an
assembly
emily
sighed
gently
as
she
entered
the
carriage
of
her
aunt
early
in
the
afternoon
leaving
denbigh
in
the
door
of
the
lodge
and
egerton
absent
on
the
execution
of
some
business
the
former
to
amuse
himself
as
he
could
until
the
following
morning
and
the
latter
to
join
them
in
the
dance
in
the
evening
the
arrangement
included
an
excursion
on
the
water
attended
by
the
bands
from
the
frigates
a
collation
and
in
the
evening
a
ball
one
of
the
vessels
was
commanded
by
a
lord
henry
stapleton
a
fine
young
man
who
struck
with
the
beauty
and
appearance
of
the
sisters
sought
an
introduction
to
the
baronet
family
and
engaged
the
hand
of
emily
for
the
first
dance
his
frank
and
deportment
was
pleasing
to
his
new
acquaintances
the
more
so
as
it
was
peculiarly
suited
to
their
situation
at
the
moment
wilson
was
in
unusual
spirits
and
maintained
an
animated
conversation
with
the
young
sailor
in
the
course
of
which
he
spoke
of
his
cruising
on
the
coast
of
spain
and
by
accident
he
mentioned
his
having
carried
out
to
that
country
upon
one
occasion
lord
pendennyss
this
was
common
ground
between
them
and
lord
henry
was
as
enthusiastic
in
his
praises
of
the
earl
as
partiality
could
desire
he
also
knew
colonel
egerton
slightly
and
expressed
his
pleasure
in
polite
terms
when
they
met
in
the
evening
in
the
at
being
able
to
renew
his
acquaintance
the
evening
passed
off
as
such
evenings
generally
do
in
gaiety
listlessness
dancing
gaping
and
heartburnings
according
to
the
dispositions
and
good
or
ill
fortune
of
the
several
individuals
who
compose
the
assembly
wilson
while
her
nieces
were
dancing
moved
her
seat
to
be
near
a
window
and
found
herself
in
the
vicinity
of
two
elderly
gentlemen
who
were
commenting
on
the
company
after
making
several
remarks
one
of
them
inquired
of
the
other
who
is
that
military
gentleman
amongst
the
naval
beaux
holt
that
is
the
hopeful
nephew
of
my
friend
and
neighbor
sir
edgar
egerton
he
is
here
dancing
and
misspending
his
time
and
money
when
i
know
sir
edgar
gave
him
a
thousand
pounds
six
months
ago
on
express
condition
he
should
not
leave
the
regiment
or
take
a
card
in
his
hand
for
twelvemonth
he
plays
then
sadly
he
is
on
the
whole
a
very
bad
young
man
as
they
changed
their
topic
wilson
joined
her
sister
dreadfully
shocked
at
this
intimation
of
the
vices
of
a
man
so
near
an
alliance
with
her
brother
child
she
was
thankful
it
was
not
too
late
to
avert
part
of
the
evil
and
determined
to
acquaint
sir
edward
at
once
with
what
she
had
heard
in
order
that
an
investigation
might
establish
the
colonel
innocence
or
guilt
chapter
xxv
they
returned
to
the
lodge
at
an
early
hour
and
mrs
wilson
after
meditating
upon
the
course
she
ought
to
take
resolved
to
have
a
conversation
with
her
brother
that
evening
after
supper
accordingly
as
they
were
among
the
last
to
retire
she
mentioned
her
wish
to
detain
him
and
when
left
by
themselves
the
baronet
taking
his
seat
by
her
on
a
sofa
she
commenced
as
follows
willing
to
avoid
her
unpleasant
information
until
the
last
moment
i
wished
to
say
something
to
you
brother
relating
to
my
charge
you
have
no
doubt
observed
the
attentions
of
denbigh
to
emily
certainly
sister
and
with
great
pleasure
you
must
not
suppose
i
wish
to
interfere
with
the
authority
i
have
so
freely
relinquished
to
you
charlotte
when
i
inquire
if
emily
favors
his
views
or
not
neither
emily
nor
i
my
dear
brother
wish
ever
to
question
your
right
not
only
to
inquire
into
but
to
control
the
conduct
of
your
child
she
is
yours
edward
by
a
tie
nothing
can
break
and
we
both
love
you
too
much
to
wish
it
there
is
nothing
you
may
be
more
certain
of
than
that
without
the
approbation
of
her
parents
emily
would
accept
of
no
offer
however
splendid
or
agreeable
to
her
own
wishes
nay
sister
i
would
not
wish
unduly
to
influence
my
child
in
an
affair
of
so
much
importance
to
herself
but
my
interest
in
denbigh
is
little
short
of
that
i
feel
for
my
daughter
i
trust
continued
wilson
emily
is
too
deeply
impressed
with
her
duty
to
forget
the
impressive
mandate
honor
her
father
and
mother
yes
sir
edward
i
am
mistaken
if
she
would
not
relinquish
the
dearest
object
of
her
affections
at
your
request
and
at
the
same
time
i
am
persuaded
she
would
under
no
circumstances
approach
the
altar
with
a
man
she
did
not
both
love
and
esteem
the
baronet
did
not
appear
exactly
to
understand
his
distinction
as
he
observed
i
am
not
sure
i
rightly
comprehend
the
difference
you
make
charlotte
only
brother
that
she
would
feel
that
a
promise
made
at
the
altar
to
love
a
man
she
felt
averse
to
or
honor
one
she
could
not
esteem
as
a
breach
of
a
duty
paramount
to
all
earthly
considerations
replied
his
sister
but
to
answer
your
question
denbigh
has
never
offered
and
when
he
does
i
do
not
think
he
will
be
refused
refused
cried
the
baronet
i
sincerely
hope
not
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
they
were
married
already
emily
is
very
young
said
wilson
and
need
not
hurry
i
was
in
hopes
she
would
remain
single
a
few
years
longer
well
said
the
baronet
you
and
lady
moseley
sister
have
different
notions
on
the
subject
of
marrying
the
girls
wilson
replied
with
a
smile
you
have
made
anne
so
good
a
husband
ned
that
she
forgets
there
are
any
bad
ones
in
the
world
my
greatest
anxiety
is
that
the
husband
of
my
niece
may
be
a
christian
indeed
i
know
not
how
i
can
reconcile
it
to
my
conscience
as
a
christian
myself
to
omit
this
important
qualification
i
am
sure
charlotte
both
denbigh
and
egerton
appear
to
have
a
great
respect
for
religion
they
are
punctual
at
church
and
very
attentive
to
the
service
wilson
smiled
as
he
proceeded
but
religion
may
come
after
marriage
you
know
yes
brother
and
i
know
it
may
not
come
at
all
no
really
pious
woman
can
be
happy
without
her
husband
is
in
what
she
deems
the
road
to
future
happiness
himself
and
it
is
idle
it
is
worse
it
is
almost
impious
to
marry
with
a
view
to
reform
a
husband
indeed
she
greatly
endangers
her
own
safety
thereby
for
few
of
us
i
believe
but
find
the
temptation
to
err
as
much
as
we
can
contend
with
without
calling
in
the
aid
of
example
against
us
in
an
object
we
love
indeed
it
appears
to
me
the
life
of
such
a
woman
must
be
a
struggle
between
conflicting
duties
why
said
the
baronet
if
your
plan
were
generally
adopted
i
am
afraid
it
would
give
a
deadly
blow
to
matrimony
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
generals
brother
i
am
acting
for
individual
happiness
and
discharging
individual
duties
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
agree
with
you
in
its
effects
on
the
community
i
think
no
man
who
dispassionately
examines
the
subject
will
be
other
than
a
christian
and
rather
than
remain
bachelors
they
would
take
even
that
trouble
if
the
strife
in
our
sex
were
less
for
a
husband
wives
would
increase
in
value
but
how
is
it
charlotte
said
the
baronet
pleasantly
your
sex
do
not
use
your
power
and
reform
the
age
the
work
of
reformation
sir
edward
replied
his
sister
gravely
is
an
arduous
one
indeed
and
i
despair
of
seeing
it
general
in
my
day
but
much
very
much
might
be
done
towards
it
if
those
who
have
the
guidance
of
youth
would
take
that
trouble
with
their
pupils
that
good
faith
requires
of
them
to
discharge
the
minor
duties
of
life
women
ought
to
marry
observed
the
baronet
musing
marriage
is
certainly
the
natural
and
most
desirable
state
for
a
woman
but
how
few
are
there
who
having
entered
it
know
how
to
discharge
its
duties
more
particularly
those
of
a
mother
on
the
subject
of
marrying
our
daughters
for
instance
instead
of
qualifying
them
to
make
a
proper
choice
they
are
generally
left
to
pick
up
such
principles
and
opinions
as
they
may
come
at
as
it
were
by
chance
it
is
true
if
the
parent
be
a
christian
in
name
certain
of
the
externals
of
religion
are
observed
but
what
are
these
if
not
enforced
by
a
consistent
example
in
the
instructor
useful
precepts
are
seldom
lost
i
believe
sister
said
sir
edward
with
confidence
always
useful
my
dear
brother
but
young
people
are
more
observant
than
we
are
apt
to
imagine
and
are
wonderfully
ingenious
in
devising
excuses
to
themselves
for
their
conduct
i
have
often
heard
it
offered
as
an
apology
that
father
or
mother
knew
it
or
perhaps
did
it
and
therefore
it
could
not
be
wrong
association
is
to
a
child
i
believe
no
family
of
consequence
admits
of
improper
associates
within
my
knowledge
said
the
baronet
wilson
smiled
as
she
answered
i
am
sure
i
hope
not
edward
but
are
the
qualifications
we
require
in
companions
for
our
daughters
always
such
as
are
most
reconcileable
with
our
good
sense
or
our
consciences
a
single
communication
with
an
objectionable
character
is
a
precedent
if
known
and
unobserved
which
will
be
offered
to
excuse
acquaintances
with
worse
persons
with
the
other
sex
especially
their
acquaintance
should
be
very
guarded
and
select
you
would
make
many
old
maids
sister
i
doubt
it
greatly
brother
it
would
rather
bring
female
society
in
demand
i
often
regret
that
selfishness
cupidity
and
the
kind
of
strife
which
prevails
in
our
sex
on
the
road
to
matrimony
have
brought
celibacy
into
disrepute
for
my
part
i
never
see
an
old
maid
but
i
am
willing
to
think
she
is
so
from
choice
or
principle
and
although
not
in
her
proper
place
serviceable
by
keeping
alive
feelings
necessary
to
exist
that
marriages
may
not
become
curses
instead
of
blessings
a
kind
of
eddystone
to
prevent
matrimonial
shipwrecks
said
the
brother
gayly
their
lot
may
be
solitary
baronet
and
in
some
measure
cheerless
but
infinitely
preferable
to
a
marriage
that
may
lead
them
astray
from
their
duties
or
give
birth
to
a
family
which
are
to
be
turned
on
the
world
without
any

but
form
without
any

but
truisms

without
even
a

which
has
not
been
seared
by
indulgence
i
hope
that
anne
in
the
performance
of
her
system
will
have
no
cause
to
regret
its
failure
clara
chose
for
herself
and
has
done
well
charlotte

so
i
doubt
not

jane

emily
and
i
confess
i
think
their

is
right
it
is
true
said
wilson
clara
has
done
well
though
under
circumstances
of
but
little
risk
she
might
have
jumped
into
your
pond
and
escaped
with
life
but
the
chances
are
she
would
drown
nor
do
i
dispute
the
right
of
the
girls
to
choose
for
themselves
but
i
say
the
rights
extend
to
requiring
us
to
qualify
them
to
make
their
choice
i
am
sorry
edward
to
be
the
instigator
of
doubts
in
your
breast
of
the
worth
of
any
one
especially
as
it
may
give
you
pain
here
wilson
took
her
brother
affectionately
by
the
hand
and
communicated
what
she
had
overheard
that
evening
although
the
impressions
of
the
baronet
were
not
as
vivid
or
as
deep
as
those
of
his
sister
his
parental
love
was
too
great
not
to
make
him
extremely
uneasy
under
the
intelligence
and
after
thanking
her
for
her
attention
to
his
children
welfare
he
kissed
her
and
withdrew
in
passing
to
his
own
room
he
met
egerton
that
moment
returned
from
escorting
the
jarvis
ladies
to
their
lodgings
a
task
he
had
undertaken
at
the
request
of
jane
as
they
were
without
any
male
attendant
sir
edward
heart
was
too
full
not
to
seek
immediate
relief
and
as
he
had
strong
hopes
of
the
innocence
of
the
colonel
though
he
could
give
no
reason
for
his
expectation
he
returned
with
him
to
the
parlor
and
in
a
few
words
acquainted
him
with
the
slanders
which
had
been
circulated
at
his
expense
begging
him
by
all
means
to
disprove
them
as
soon
as
possible
the
colonel
was
struck
with
the
circumstance
at
first
but
assured
sir
edward
it
was
entirely
untrue
he
never
played
as
he
might
have
noticed
and
that
holt
was
an
ancient
enemy
of
his
he
would
in
the
morning
take
measures
to
convince
sir
edward
that
he
stood
higher
in
the
estimation
of
his
uncle
than
holt
had
thought
proper
to
state
much
relieved
by
this
explanation
the
baronet
forgetting
that
this
heavy
charge
removed
he
only
stood
where
he
did
before
he
took
time
for
his
inquiries
assured
him
that
if
he
could
convince
him
or
rather
his
sister
he
did
not
gamble
he
would
receive
him
as
a
with
pleasure
the
gentlemen
shook
hands
and
parted
denbigh
had
retired
to
his
room
early
telling
benfield
he
did
not
feel
well
and
thus
missed
the
party
at
supper
and
by
twelve
silence
prevailed
in
the
house
as
usual
after
a
previous
day
of
pleasure
the
party
were
late
in
assembling
on
the
following
yet
denbigh
was
the
last
who
made
his
appearance
wilson
thought
he
threw
a
look
round
the
room
as
he
entered
which
prevented
his
making
his
salutations
in
his
usual
easy
and
polished
manner
in
a
few
minutes
however
his
awkwardness
was
removed
and
they
took
their
seats
at
the
table
at
that
moment
the
door
of
the
room
was
thrown
hastily
open
and
jarvis
entered
abruptly
and
with
a
look
bordering
on
wildness
in
his
eye
is
she
not
here
exclaimed
the
merchant
scanning
the
company
closely
who
inquired
all
in
a
breath
polly
my
daughter
my
child
said
the
merchant
endeavoring
to
control
his
feelings
did
she
not
come
here
this
morning
with
colonel
egerton
he
was
answered
in
the
negative
and
he
briefly
explained
the
cause
of
his
anxiety
the
colonel
had
called
very
early
and
sent
her
maid
up
to
his
daughter
who
rose
immediately
they
had
quitted
the
house
together
leaving
word
the
miss
moseleys
had
sent
for
the
young
lady
to
breakfast
for
some
particular
reason
such
was
the
latitude
allowed
by
his
wife
that
nothing
was
suspected
until
one
of
the
servants
of
the
house
said
he
had
seen
colonel
egerton
and
a
lady
drive
out
of
the
village
that
morning
in
a
and
four
then
the
old
gentleman
first
took
the
alarm
and
he
proceeded
instantly
to
the
lodge
in
quest
of
his
daughter
of
the
elopement
there
now
remained
no
doubt
and
an
examination
into
the
state
of
the
room
who
it
had
been
thought
was
not
yet
risen
gave
assurance
of
it
here
was
at
once
sad
confirmation
that
the
opinion
of
holt
was
a
just
one
although
every
heart
felt
for
jane
during
this
dreadful
explanation
no
eye
was
turned
on
her
excepting
the
stolen
and
anxious
glances
of
her
sister
but
when
all
was
confirmed
and
nothing
remained
but
to
reflect
or
act
upon
the
circumstances
she
naturally
engrossed
the
whole
attention
of
her
fond
parents
jane
had
listened
in
indignation
to
the
commencement
of
the
narrative
of
jarvis
and
so
firmly
was
egerton
enshrined
in
purity
within
her
imagination
that
not
until
it
was
ascertained
that
both
his
servant
and
clothes
were
missing
would
she
admit
a
thought
injurious
to
his
truth
then
indeed
the
feelings
of
jarvis
his
plain
statement
corroborated
by
this
testimony
struck
her
at
once
as
true
and
as
she
rose
to
leave
the
room
she
fell
senseless
into
the
arms
of
emily
who
observing
her
movement
and
loss
of
color
had
flown
to
her
assistance
denbigh
had
drawn
the
merchant
out
in
vain
efforts
to
appease
him
and
happily
no
one
witnessed
this
effect
of
jane
passion
but
her
nearest
relatives
she
was
immediately
removed
to
her
own
room
and
in
a
short
time
was
in
bed
with
a
burning
fever
the
bursts
of
her
grief
were
uncontrolled
and
violent
at
times
she
reproached
herself
her
friends
egerton
in
short
she
was
guilty
of
all
the
inconsistent
sensations
that
disappointed
hopes
accompanied
by
the
consciousness
of
weakness
on
our
part
seldom
fail
to
give
rise
to
the
presence
of
her
friends
was
irksome
to
her
and
it
was
only
to
the
soft
and
insinuating
blandishments
of
emily
love
that
she
would
at
all
yield
perseverance
and
affection
at
length
prevailed
and
as
emily
took
the
opportunity
of
some
refreshments
to
infuse
a
strong
soporific
jane
lost
her
consciousness
of
misery
in
a
temporary
repose
in
the
mean
time
a
more
searching
inquiry
had
been
able
to
trace
out
the
manner
and
direction
of
the
journey
of
the
fugitives
it
appeared
the
colonel
left
the
lodge
immediately
after
his
conversation
with
sir
edward
he
slept
at
a
tavern
and
caused
his
servant
to
remove
his
baggage
at
daylight
here
he
had
ordered
a
chaise
and
horses
and
then
proceeded
as
mentioned
to
the
lodgings
of
jarvis
what
arguments
he
used
with
miss
jarvis
to
urge
her
to
so
sudden
a
flight
remained
a
secret
but
from
the
remarks
of
jarvis
and
miss
sarah
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
induced
them
to
think
from
the
commencement
that
his
intentions
were
single
and
mary
jarvis
their
object
how
he
contrived
to
gloss
over
his
attentions
to
jane
in
such
a
manner
as
to
deceive
those
ladies
caused
no
little
surprise
but
it
was
obvious
it
had
been
done
and
the
moseleys
were
not
without
hopes
his
situation
with
jane
would
not
make
the
noise
in
the
world
such
occurrences
seldom
fail
to
excite
in
the
afternoon
a
letter
was
handed
to
jarvis
and
by
him
immediately
communicated
to
the
baronet
and
denbigh
both
of
whom
he
considered
as
among
his
best
friends
it
was
from
egerton
and
written
in
a
respectful
manner
he
apologized
for
his
elopement
and
excused
it
on
the
ground
of
a
wish
to
avoid
the
delay
of
a
license
or
the
publishing
of
bans
as
he
was
in
hourly
expectation
of
a
summons
to
his
regiment
and
contained
many
promises
of
making
an
attentive
husband
and
an
affectionate
son
the
fugitives
were
on
the
road
to
scotland
whence
they
intended
immediately
to
return
to
london
and
to
wait
the
commands
of
their
parents
the
baronet
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
at
the
sufferings
of
his
own
child
congratulated
the
merchant
that
things
were
no
worse
while
denbigh
curled
his
lips
as
he
read
the
epistle
and
thought
settlements
were
a
greater
inconvenience
than
the
bans
for
it
was
a
well
known
fact
a
maiden
aunt
had
left
the
jarvises
twenty
thousand
pounds
between
them
chapter
xxvi
although
the
affections
of
jane
had
sustained
a
blow
her
pride
had
received
a
greater
and
no
persuasions
of
her
mother
or
sister
could
induce
her
to
leave
her
room
she
talked
little
but
once
or
twice
she
yielded
to
the
affectionate
attentions
of
emily
and
poured
out
her
sorrows
into
the
bosom
of
her
sister
at
such
moments
she
would
declare
her
intention
of
never
appearing
in
the
world
again
one
of
these
paroxysms
of
sorrow
was
witnessed
by
her
mother
and
for
the
first
time
mingled
in
the
grief
of
the
matron
had
she
trusted
less
to
appearances
and
to
the
opinions
of
indifferent
and
acquaintances
her
daughter
might
have
been
apprized
in
season
of
the
character
of
the
man
who
had
stolen
her
affections
to
a
direct
exhibition
of
misery
lady
moseley
was
always
sensible
and
for
the
moment
she
became
alive
to
its
causes
and
consequences
but
a
timely
and
judicious
safeguard
against
future
moral
evils
was
a
forecast
neither
her
inactivity
of
mind
nor
abilities
were
equal
to
we
shall
leave
jane
to
brood
over
her
lover
misconduct
while
we
regret
she
is
without
the
consolation
alone
able
to
bear
her
up
against
the
misfortunes
of
life
and
return
to
the
other
personages
of
our
history
the
visit
to
fitzgerald
had
been
postponed
in
consequence
of
indisposition
but
a
week
after
the
colonel
departure
wilson
thought
as
jane
had
consented
to
leave
her
room
and
emily
really
began
to
look
pale
from
her
confinement
by
the
side
of
a
sick
bed
she
would
redeem
the
pledge
she
had
given
the
recluse
on
the
following
morning
they
found
the
ladies
at
the
cottage
happy
to
see
them
and
anxious
to
hear
of
the
health
of
jane
of
whose
illness
they
had
been
informed
by
note
after
offering
her
guests
some
refreshments
fitzgerald
who
appeared
laboring
under
a
greater
melancholy
than
usual
proceeded
to
make
them
acquainted
with
the
incidents
of
her
life
the
daughter
of
an
english
merchant
at
lisbon
had
fled
from
the
house
of
her
father
to
the
protection
of
an
irish
officer
in
the
service
of
his
catholic
majesty
they
were
united
and
the
colonel
immediately
took
his
bride
to
madrid
the
offspring
of
this
union
were
a
son
and
daughter
the
former
at
an
early
age
had
entered
into
the
service
of
his
king
and
had
as
usual
been
bred
in
the
faith
of
his
ancestors
but
the
señora
mccarthy
had
been
educated
and
yet
remained
a
protestant
and
contrary
to
her
faith
to
her
husband
secretly
instructed
her
daughter
in
the
same
belief
at
the
age
of
seventeen
a
principal
grandee
of
the
court
of
charles
sought
the
hand
of
the
general
child
the
conde
was
a
match
not
to
be
refused
and
they
were
united
in
the
heartless
and
formal
manner
in
which
marriages
are
too
often
entered
into
in
countries
where
the
customs
of
society
prevent
an
intercourse
between
the
sexes
the
conde
never
possessed
the
affections
of
his
wife
of
a
stern
and
unyielding
disposition
his
harshness
repelled
her
love
and
as
she
naturally
turned
her
eyes
to
the
home
of
her
childhood
she
cherished
all
those
peculiar
sentiments
she
had
imbibed
from
her
mother
thus
although
she
appeared
to
the
world
a
catholic
she
lived
in
secret
a
protestant
her
parents
had
always
used
the
english
language
in
their
family
and
she
spoke
it
as
fluently
as
the
spanish
to
encourage
her
recollections
of
this
strong
feature
which
distinguished
the
house
of
her
father
from
the
others
she
entered
she
perused
closely
and
constantly
those
books
which
the
death
of
her
mother
placed
at
her
disposal
these
were
principally
protestant
works
on
religious
subjects
and
the
countess
became
a
strong
sectarian
without
becoming
a
christian
as
she
was
compelled
to
use
the
same
books
in
teaching
her
only
child
the
donna
julia
english
the
consequences
of
the
original
false
step
of
her
grandmother
were
perpetuated
in
the
person
of
this
young
lady
in
learning
english
she
also
learned
to
secede
from
the
faith
of
her
father
and
entailed
upon
herself
a
life
of
either
persecution
or
hypocrisy
the
countess
was
guilty
of
the
unpardonable
error
of
complaining
to
their
child
of
the
treatment
she
received
from
her
husband
and
as
these
conversations
were
held
in
english
and
were
consecrated
by
the
tears
of
the
mother
they
made
an
indelible
impression
on
the
youthful
mind
of
julia
who
grew
up
with
the
conviction
that
next
to
being
a
catholic
herself
the
greatest
evil
of
life
was
to
be
the
wife
of
one
on
her
attaining
her
fifteenth
year
she
had
the
misfortune
if
it
could
be
termed
one
to
lose
her
mother
and
within
the
year
her
father
presented
to
her
a
nobleman
of
the
vicinity
as
her
future
husband
how
long
the
religious
faith
of
julia
would
have
endured
unsupported
by
example
in
others
and
assailed
by
the
passions
soliciting
in
behalf
of
a
young
and
handsome
cavalier
it
might
be
difficult
to
pronounce
but
as
suitor
was
neither
very
young
and
the
reverse
of
very
handsome
it
is
certain
the
more
he
wooed
the
more
confirmed
she
became
in
her
heresy
until
in
a
moment
of
desperation
and
as
an
only
refuge
against
his
solicitations
she
candidly
avowed
her
creed
the
anger
of
her
father
was
violent
and
lasting
she
was
doomed
to
a
convent
as
both
a
penance
for
her
sins
and
a
means
of
reformation
physical
resistance
was
not
in
her
power
but
mentally
she
determined
never
to
yield
her
body
was
immured
but
her
mind
continued
unshaken
and
rather
more
settled
in
her
belief
by
the
aid
of
those
passions
which
had
been
excited
by
injudicious
harshness
for
two
years
she
continued
in
her
novitiate
obstinately
refusing
to
take
the
vows
of
the
order
and
at
the
end
of
that
period
the
situation
of
her
country
had
called
her
father
and
uncle
to
the
field
as
defenders
of
the
rights
of
their
lawful
prince
perhaps
to
this
it
was
owing
that
harsher
measures
were
not
adopted
in
her
case
the
war
now
raged
around
them
in
its
greatest
horrors
until
at
length
a
general
battle
was
fought
in
the
neighborhood
and
the
dormitories
of
the
peaceful
nuns
were
crowded
with
wounded
british
officers
amongst
others
of
his
nation
was
a
major
fitzgerald
a
young
man
of
strikingly
handsome
countenance
and
pleasant
manners
chance
threw
him
under
the
more
immediate
charge
of
julia
his
recovery
was
slow
and
for
a
time
doubtful
and
as
much
owing
to
good
nursing
as
science
the
major
was
grateful
and
julia
unhappy
as
she
was
beautiful
that
love
should
be
the
offspring
of
this
association
will
excite
no
surprise
a
brigade
of
british
encamping
in
the
vicinity
of

the
young
couple

its
protection
from

vengeance
and

cruelty
they
were
married
by

for
a
month

were
happy
as

both
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
they
were
kindly
treated
and
allowed
every
indulgence
their
situation
admitted
until
a
small
escort
of
prisoners
was
sent
to
the
frontiers
in
this
they
were
included
and
had
proceeded
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
pyrenees
when
in
their
turn
the
french
were
assailed
suddenly
and
entirely
routed
and
the
captive
spaniards
of
which
the
party
with
the
exception
of
our
young
couple
consisted
released
as
the
french
guard
made
a
resistance
until
overpowered
by
numbers
an
unfortunate
ball
struck
major
fitzgerald
to
the
earth
he
survived
but
an
hour
and
died
where
he
fell
on
the
open
field
an
english
officer
the
last
of
his
retiring
countrymen
was
attracted
by
the
sight
of
a
woman
weeping
over
the
body
of
a
fallen
man
and
approached
them
in
a
few
words
fitzgerald
explained
his
situation
to
this
gentleman
and
exacted
a
pledge
from
him
to
guard
his
julia
in
safety
to
his
mother
in
england
the
stranger
promised
everything
the
dying
husband
required
and
by
the
time
death
had
closed
the
eyes
of
fitzgerald
he
had
procured
from
some
peasants
a
rude
conveyance
into
which
the
body
with
its
almost
equally
lifeless
widow
were
placed
the
party
which
intercepted
the
convoy
of
prisoners
had
been
out
from
the
british
camp
on
other
duty
but
its
commander
hearing
of
the
escort
had
pushed
rapidly
into
a
country
covered
by
the
enemy
to
effect
their
rescue
and
his
service
done
he
was
compelled
to
make
a
hasty
retreat
to
ensure
his
own
security
to
this
was
owing
the
indifference
which
left
the
major
to
the
care
of
the
spanish
peasantry
who
had
gathered
to
the
spot
and
the
retreating
troops
had
got
several
miles
on
their
return
before
the
widow
and
her
protector
commenced
their
journey
it
was
impossible
to
overtake
them
and
the
inhabitants
acquainting
the
gentleman
that
a
body
of
french
dragoons
were
already
harassing
their
rear
he
was
compelled
to
seek
another
route
to
the
camp
this
with
some
trouble
and
no
little
danger
he
at
last
effected
and
the
day
following
the
skirmish
julia
found
herself
lodged
in
a
retired
spanish
dwelling
several
miles
within
the
advanced
posts
of
the
british
army
the
body
of
her
husband
was
respectfully
interred
and
julia
was
left
to
mourn
her
irretrievable
loss
uninterrupted
by
anything
but
by
the
hasty
visits
of
the
officer
in
whose
care
she
had
been
left
visits
which
he
stole
from
his
more
important
duties
as
a
soldier
a
month
glided
by
in
this
melancholy
manner
leaving
to
fitzgerald
the
only
consolation
she
would
receive
her
incessant
visits
to
the
grave
of
her
husband
the
calls
of
her
protector
however
became
more
frequent
and
at
length
he
announced
his
intended
departure
for
lisbon
on
his
way
to
england
a
small
covered
vehicle
drawn
by
one
horse
was
to
convey
them
to
the
city
at
which
place
he
promised
to
procure
her
a
female
attendant
and
necessaries
for
the
voyage
home
it
was
no
time
or
place
for
delicate
punctilio
and
julia
quietly
but
with
a
heart
nearly
broken
prepared
to
submit
to
the
wishes
of
her
late
husband
after
leaving
the
dwelling
the
manners
of
her
guide
sensibly
altered
he
became
complimentary
and
assiduous
to
please
but
in
a
way
rather
to
offend
than
conciliate
until
his
attentions
became
so
irksome
that
julia
actually
meditated
stopping
at
some
of
the
villages
through
which
they
passed
and
abandoning
the
attempt
of
visiting
england
entirely
but
the
desire
to
comply
with
fitzgerald
wish
that
she
would
console
his
mother
for
the
loss
of
an
only
child
and
the
dread
of
the
anger
of
her
relatives
determined
her
to
persevere
until
they
reached
lisbon
where
she
was
resolved
to
separate
for
ever
from
the
disagreeable
and
unknown
guardian
into
whose
keeping
she
had
been
thrown
by
chance
the
last
day
of
their
weary
ride
while
passing
a
wood
the
officer
so
far
forgot
his
own
character
and
julia
misfortunes
as
to
offer
personal
indignities
grown
desperate
from
her
situation
fitzgerald
sprang
from
the
vehicle
and
by
her
cries
attracted
the
notice
of
an
officer
who
was
riding
express
on
the
same
road
with
themselves
he
advanced
to
her
assistance
at
speed
but
as
he
arrived
near
them
a
pistol
fired
from
the
carriage
brought
his
horse
down
and
the
treacherous
friend
was
enabled
to
escape
undetected
julia
endeavored
to
explain
her
situation
to
her
rescuer
and
by
her
distress
and
appearance
satisfied
him
at
once
of
its
truth
within
a
short
time
a
strong
escort
of
light
dragoons
came
up
and
the
officer
despatched
some
for
a
conveyance
and
others
in
pursuit
of
that
disgrace
to
the
army
the
villanous
guide
the
former
was
soon
obtained
but
no
tidings
could
be
had
of
the
latter
the
carriage
was
found
at
a
short
distance
without
the
horse
and
with
the
baggage
of
julia
but
with
no
vestige
of
its
owner
she
never
knew
his
name
and
either
accident
or
art
had
so
completely
enveloped
him
in
mystery
that
all
efforts
to
unfold
it
then
were
fruitless
and
had
continued
so
ever
since
on
their
arrival
in
lisbon
every
attention
was
shown
to
the
disconsolate
widow
the
most
refined
delicacy
could
dictate
and
every
comfort
and
respect
were
procured
for
her
which
the
princely
fortune
high
rank
and
higher
character
of
the
earl
of
pendennyss
could
command
it
was
this
nobleman
who
on
his
way
from
with
despatches
for
england
had
been
the
means
of
preserving
julia
from
a
fate
worse
than
death
a
packet
was
in
waiting
for
the
earl
and
they
proceeded
in
her
for
home
the
donna
lorenza
was
the
widow
of
a
subaltern
spanish
officer
who
had
fallen
under
the
orders
and
near
pendennyss
and
the
interest
he
took
in
her
brave
husband
had
induced
him
to
offer
her
in
the
destruction
of
her
little
fortune
by
the
enemy
his
protection
for
near
two
years
he
had
maintained
her
at
lisbon
and
now
judging
her
a
proper
person
had
persuaded
her
to
accompany
fitzgerald
to
england
on
the
passage
which
was
very
tedious
the
earl
became
more
intimately
acquainted
with
the
history
and
character
of
his
young
friend
and
by
a
course
of
gentle
yet
powerful
expedients
had
drawn
her
mind
gradually
from
its
gloomy
contemplation
of
futurity
to
a
juster
sense
of
good
and
evil
the
peculiarity
of
her
religious
persuasion
afforded
an
introduction
to
frequent
discussions
of
the
real
opinions
of
that
church
to
which
julia
had
hitherto
belonged
although
ignorant
of
all
its
essential
and
vital
truths
these
conversations
which
were
renewed
repeatedly
in
their
intercourse
while
under
the
protection
of
his
sister
in
london
laid
the
foundations
of
a
faith
which
left
her
nothing
to
hope
for
but
the
happy
termination
of
her
earthly
probation
the
mother
of
fitzgerald
was
dead
and
as
he
had
no
near
relative
left
julia
found
herself
alone
in
the
world
her
husband
had
taken
the
precaution
to
make
a
will
in
season
it
was
properly
authenticated
and
his
widow
by
the
powerful
assistance
of
pendennyss
was
put
in
quiet
possession
of
a
little
independency
it
was
while
waiting
the
decision
of
this
affair
that
fitzgerald
resided
for
a
short
time
near
bath
as
soon
as
it
was
terminated
the
earl
and
his
sister
had
seen
her
settled
in
her
present
abode
and
once
since
had
they
visited
her
but
delicacy
had
kept
him
away
from
the
cottage
although
his
attempts
to
serve
her
had
been
constant
though
not
always
successful
he
had
on
his
return
to
spain
seen
her
father
and
interceded
with
him
on
her
behalf
but
in
vain
the
anger
of
the
spaniard
remained
unappeased
and
for
a
season
he
did
not
renew
his
efforts
out
having
heard
that
her
father
was
indisposed
julia
had
employed
the
earl
once
more
to
make
her
peace
with
him
without
prevailing
the
letter
the
ladies
had
found
her
weeping
over
was
from
pendennyss
informing
her
of
his
want
of
success
on
that
occasion
the
substance
of
the
foregoing
narrative
was
related
by
fitzgerald
to
wilson
who
repeated
it
to
emily
in
their
ride
home
the
compassion
of
both
ladies
was
strongly
moved
in
behalf
of
the
young
widow
yet
wilson
did
not
fail
to
point
out
to
her
niece
the
consequences
of
deception
and
chiefly
the
misery
which
had
followed
from
an
abandonment
of
some
of
the
primary
duties
of
life
obedience
and
respect
to
her
parent
emily
though
keenly
alive
to
all
the
principles
inculcated
by
her
aunt
found
so
much
to
be
pitied
in
the
fate
of
her
friend
that
her
failings
lost
their
proper
appearance
in
her
eyes
and
for
a
while
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
julia
and
her
misfortunes
previously
to
their
leaving
the
cottage
fitzgerald
with
glowing
cheeks
and
some
hesitation
informed
wilson
she
had
yet
another
important
communication
to
make
but
would
postpone
it
until
her
next
visit
which
wilson
promised
should
be
on
the
succeeding
day
chapter
xxvii
emily
threw
a
look
of
pleasure
on
denbigh
as
he
handed
her
from
the
carriage
which
would
have
said
if
looks
could
talk
in
the
principles
you
have
displayed
on
more
than
one
occasion
i
have
a
pledge
of
your
worth
as
he
led
her
into
the
house
he
laughingly
informed
her
that
he
had
that
morning
received
a
letter
which
would
make
his
absence
from
l
necessary
for
a
short
time
and
that
he
must
remonstrate
against
these
long
and
repeated
visits
to
a
cottage
where
all
attendants
of
the
male
sex
were
excluded
as
they
encroached
greatly
on
his
pleasures
and
improvements
bowing
as
he
spoke
to
wilson
to
this
emily
replied
gaily
that
possibly
if
he
conducted
himself
to
their
satisfaction
they
would
intercede
for
his
admission
expressing
his
pleasure
at
this
promise
as
wilson
thought
rather
awkwardly
denbigh
changed
the
conversation
at
dinner
he
repeated
to
the
family
what
he
had
mentioned
to
emily
of
his
departure
and
also
his
expectation
of
meeting
with
lord
chatterton
during
his
journey
have
you
heard
from
chatterton
lately
john
inquired
sir
edward
moseley
yes
sir
he
had
left
denbigh
castle
a
fortnight
since
and
writes
he
is
to
meet
his
friend
the
duke
at
bath
are
you
connected
with
his
grace
mr
denbigh
asked
lady
moseley
a
smile
of
indefinite
meaning
played
on
the
expressive
face
of
denbigh
as
he
answered
slightly
on
the
side
of
my
father
madam
he
has
a
sister
continued
lady
moseley
willing
to
know
more
of
chatterton
friends
and
denbigh
relatives
he
has
was
the
brief
reply
her
name
is
harriet
observed
wilson
denbigh
bowed
his
assent
in
silence
and
emily
timidly
added
lady
harriet
denbigh
lady
harriet
denbigh
will
you
do
me
the
favor
to
take
wine
the
manner
of
the
gentleman
during
this
dialogue
had
not
been
in
the
least
unpleasant
but
it
was
peculiar
it
prohibited
anything
further
on
the
subject
and
emily
was
obliged
to
be
content
without
knowing
who
marian
was
or
whether
her
name
was
to
be
found
in
the
denbigh
family
or
not
emily
was
not
in
the
least
jealous
but
she
wished
to
know
all
to
whom
her
lover
was
dear
do
the
dowager
and
the
young
ladies
accompany
chatterton
asked
sir
edward
as
he
turned
to
john
who
was
eating
his
fruit
in
silence
yes
sir
i
hope
that
is
i
believe
she
will
was
the
answer
she
who
is
she
my
son
grace
chatterton
said
john
starting
from
his
meditations
did
you
not
ask
me
about
grace
sir
edward
not
particularly
i
believe
said
the
baronet
dryly
denbigh
again
smiled
it
was
a
smile
different
from
any
wilson
had
ever
seen
on
his
countenance
and
gave
an
entirely
novel
expression
to
his
face
it
was
full
of
meaning
it
was
knowing
spoke
more
of
the
man
of
the
world
than
anything
she
had
before
noticed
in
him
and
left
on
her
mind
one
of
those
vague
impressions
she
was
often
troubled
with
that
there
was
something
about
denbigh
in
character
or
condition
or
both
that
was
mysterious
the
spirit
of
jane
was
too
great
to
leave
her
a
pining
or
pensive
maiden
yet
her
feelings
had
sustained
a
shock
that
time
alone
could
cure
she
appeared
again
amongst
her
friends
but
the
consciousness
of
her
expectations
with
respect
to
the
colonel
being
known
to
them
threw
around
her
a
hauteur
and
distance
very
foreign
to
her
natural
manner
emily
alone
whose
every
movement
sprang
from
the
spontaneous
feelings
of
her
heart
and
whose
words
and
actions
were
influenced
by
the
finest
and
most
affectionate
delicacy
such
as
she
was
not
conscious
of
possessing
herself
won
upon
the
better
feelings
of
her
sister
so
far
as
to
restore
between
them
the
usual
exchange
of
kindness
and
sympathy
but
jane
admitted
no
confidence
she
found
nothing
consoling
nothing
solid
to
justify
her
attachment
to
egerton
nothing
indeed
excepting
such
external
advantages
as
she
was
now
ashamed
to
admit
had
ever
the
power
over
her
they
in
reality
had
possessed
the
marriage
of
the
fugitives
in
scotland
had
been
announced
and
as
the
impression
that
egerton
was
to
be
connected
with
the
moseleys
was
destroyed
of
course
their
acquaintances
feeling
the
restraints
removed
that
such
an
opinion
had
once
imposed
were
free
in
their
comments
on
his
character
sir
edward
and
lady
moseley
were
astonished
to
find
how
many
things
to
his
disadvantage
were
generally
known
that
he
gambled
intrigued
and
was
in
debt
were
no
secrets
apparently
to
anybody
but
to
those
who
were
most
interested
in
knowing
the
truth
while
wilson
saw
in
these
facts
additional
reasons
for
examining
and
judging
for
ourselves
the
world
uniformly
concealing
from
the
party
and
his
friends
their
honest
opinions
of
his
character
some
of
these
insinuations
reached
the
ears
of
jane
her
aunt
having
rightly
judged
that
the
surest
way
to
destroy
egerton
power
over
the
imagination
of
her
niece
was
to
strip
him
of
his
fictitious
qualities
suggested
this
expedient
to
lady
moseley
and
some
of
their
visitors
had
though
as
the
colonel
had
certainly
been
attentive
to
miss
moseley
it
would
give
her
pleasure
to
know
that
her
rival
had
not
made
the
most
eligible
match
in
the
kingdom
the
project
of
wilson
succeeded
in
a
great
measure
but
although
egerton
fell
jane
did
not
find
she
rose
in
her
own
estimation
and
her
friends
wisely
concluded
that
time
was
the
only
remedy
that
could
restore
her
former
serenity
in
the
morning
wilson
unwilling
to
have
emily
present
at
a
conversation
she
intended
to
hold
with
denbigh
with
a
view
to
satisfy
her
annoying
doubts
as
to
some
minor
points
in
his
character
after
excusing
herself
to
her
niece
invited
that
gentleman
to
a
morning
drive
he
accepted
her
invitation
cheerfully
and
wilson
saw
it
was
only
as
they
drove
from
the
door
without
emily
that
he
betrayed
the
faintest
reluctance
to
the
jaunt
when
they
had
got
a
short
distance
from
the
lodge
she
acquainted
him
with
her
intention
of
presenting
him
to
fitzgerald
whither
she
had
ordered
the
coachman
to
proceed
denbigh
started
as
she
mentioned
the
name
and
after
a
few
silence
desired
wilson
to
allow
him
to
stop
the
carriage
he
was
not
very
well
was
sorry
to
be
so
rude
but
with
her
permission
he
would
alight
and
return
to
the
house
as
he
requested
in
an
earnest
manner
that
she
would
proceed
without
him
and
by
no
means
disappoint
her
friend
wilson
complied
yet
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
account
for
his
sudden
illness
she
turned
her
head
to
see
how
the
sick
man
fared
a
short
time
after
he
had
left
her
and
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
him
talking
very
composedly
with
john
who
had
met
him
on
his
way
to
the
fields
with
his
gun
lovesick
thought
wilson
with
a
smile
and
as
she
rode
on
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
as
denbigh
was
to
leave
them
soon
emily
would
have
an
important
communication
to
make
on
her
return
well
thought
wilson
with
a
sigh
if
it
is
to
happen
it
may
as
well
be
done
at
once
fitzgerald
was
expecting
her
and
appeared
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
that
she
had
come
alone
after
some
introductory
conversation
the
ladies
withdrew
by
themselves
and
julia
acquainted
wilson
with
a
new
source
of
uneasiness
the
day
the
ladies
had
promised
to
visit
her
but
had
been
prevented
by
the
arrangements
for
the
ball
the
donna
lorenza
had
driven
to
the
village
to
make
some
purchases
attended
as
usual
by
their
only
and
fitzgerald
was
sitting
in
the
little
parlor
in
momentary
expectation
of
her
friends
by
herself
the
sound
of
footsteps
drew
her
to
the
door
which
she
opened
for
the
admission
of
the
wretch
whose
treachery
to
her
dying
husband
requests
had
given
her
so
much
uneasiness
horror
fear
surprise
altogether
prevented
her
from
making
any
alarm
at
the
moment
and
she
sank
into
a
chair
he
stood
between
her
and
the
door
as
he
endeavored
to
draw
her
into
a
conversation
he
assured
her
she
had
nothing
to
fear
that
he
loved
her
and
her
alone
that
he
was
about
to
be
married
to
a
daughter
of
sir
edward
moseley
but
would
give
her
up
fortune
everything
if
she
would
consent
to
become
his
wife
that
the
views
of
her
protector
he
doubted
not
were
dishonorable
that
he
himself
was
willing
to
atone
for
his
former
excess
of
passion
by
a
life
devoted
to
her
how
much
longer
he
would
have
gone
on
and
what
further
he
would
have
offered
is
unknown
for
fitzgerald
having
recovered
herself
a
little
darted
to
the
bell
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
he
tried
to
prevent
her
ringing
it
but
was
too
late
a
short
struggle
followed
when
the
sound
of
the
footsteps
of
the
maid
compelled
him
to
retreat
precipitately
fitzgerald
added
that
his
assertion
concerning
miss
moseley
had
given
her
incredible
uneasiness
and
prevented
her
making
the
communication
yesterday
but
she
understood
this
morning
through
her
maid
that
a
colonel
egerton
who
had
been
supposed
to
be
engaged
to
one
of
sir
edward
daughters
had
eloped
with
another
lady
that
egerton
was
her
persecutor
she
did
not
now
entertain
a
doubt
but
that
it
was
in
the
power
of
wilson
probably
to
make
the
discovery
as
in
the
struggle
between
them
for
the
bell
a
had
fallen
from
the
of
his
coat
and
his
retreat
was
too
sudden
to
recover
it
as
she
put
the
book
into
the
hands
of
wilson
she
desired
she
would
take
means
to
return
it
to
its
owner
its
contents
might
be
of
value
though
she
had
not
thought
it
correct
to
examine
it
wilson
took
the
book
and
as
she
dropped
it
into
her
smiled
at
the
spanish
punctilio
of
her
friend
in
not
looking
into
her
prize
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
a
few
questions
as
to
the
place
and
year
of
his
first
attempts
soon
convinced
her
it
was
egerton
whose
unlicensed
passions
had
given
so
much
trouble
to
fitzgerald
he
had
served
but
one
campaign
in
spain
and
in
that
year
and
that
division
of
the
army
and
surely
his
principles
were
no
restraint
upon
his
conduct
fitzgerald
begged
the
advice
of
her
more
experienced
friend
as
to
the
steps
she
ought
to
take
to
which
the
former
asked
if
she
had
made
lord
pendennyss
acquainted
with
the
occurrence
the
young
widow
cheek
glowed
as
she
answered
that
at
the
same
time
she
felt
assured
the
base
insinuation
of
egerton
was
unfounded
it
had
created
a
repugnance
in
her
to
troubling
the
earl
any
more
than
was
necessary
in
her
affairs
and
as
she
kissed
the
hand
of
wilson
she
added
besides
your
goodness
my
dear
madam
renders
any
other
adviser
unnecessary
now
wilson
pressed
her
hand
affectionately
and
assured
her
of
her
good
wishes
and
unaltered
esteem
she
commended
her
delicacy
and
plainly
told
the
young
widow
that
how
ever
unexceptionable
the
character
of
pendennyss
might
be
a
female
friend
was
the
only
one
a
woman
in
her
situation
could
repose
confidence
in
without
justly
incurring
the
sarcasms
of
the
world
as
egerton
was
now
married
and
would
not
probably
offer
for
the
present
at
least
any
further
molestation
to
fitzgerald
it
was
concluded
to
be
unnecessary
to
take
any
immediate
measures
of
precaution
and
wilson
thought
the
purse
of
jarvis
might
be
made
the
means
of
keeping
him
within
proper
bounds
in
future
the
merchant
was
prompt
and
not
easily
intimidated
and
the
slightest
intimation
of
the
truth
would
she
knew
be
sufficient
to
engage
him
on
their
side
heart
and
hand
the
ladies
parted
with
a
promise
of
meeting
soon
again
and
an
additional
interest
in
each
other
by
the
communications
of
that
and
the
preceding
day
wilson
had
ridden
half
the
distance
between
the
cottage
and
the
lodge
before
it
occurred
to
her
they
had
not
absolutely
ascertained
by
the
best
means
in
their
possession
the
identity
of
colonel
egerton
with
julia
persecutor
she
accordingly
took
the
from
her
bag
and
opened
it
for
examination
a
couple
of
letters
fell
from
it
into
her
lap
and
conceiving
their
direction
would
establish
all
she
wished
to
know
as
they
had
been
read
she
turned
to
the
superscription
of
one
of
them
and
saw
george
denbigh
esq
in
the
well
known
of
dr
mrs
wilson
felt
herself
overcome
to
a
degree
that
compelled
her
to
lower
a
glass
of
the
carriage
for
air
she
sat
gazing
on
the
letters
until
the
characters
swam
before
her
eyes
in
undistinguished
confusion
and
with
difficulty
she
rallied
her
thoughts
to
the
point
necessary
for
investigation
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
equal
to
the
task
she
examined
the
letters
with
the
closest
scrutiny
and
opened
them
both
to
be
sure
there
was
no
mistake
she
saw
the
dates
the
dear
george
at
the
commencements
and
the
doctor
name
subscribed
before
she
would
believe
they
were
real
it
was
then
the
truth
appeared
to
break
upon
her
in
a
flood
of
light
the
aversion
of
denbigh
to
speak
of
spain
or
of
his
services
in
that
country
his
avoiding
sir
herbert
nicholson
and
that
gentleman
observations
respecting
him
colonel
egerton
and
his
own
manners
his
absence
from
the
ball
and
startling
looks
on
the
following
morning
and
at
different
times
before
and
displeasure
at
the
name
of
pendennyss
on
various
occasions
and
his
cheerful
acceptance
of
her
invitation
to
ride
until
he
knew
her
destination
and
singular
manner
of
leaving
her
were
all
accounted
for
by
this
dreadful
discovery
and
wilson
found
the
solution
of
her
doubts
rushing
on
her
mind
with
a
force
and
rapidity
that
sickened
her
the
misfortunes
of
fitzgerald
the
unfortunate
issue
to
the
passion
of
jane
were
trifles
in
the
estimation
of
wilson
compared
to
the
discovery
of
denbigh
unworthiness
she
revolved
in
her
mind
his
conduct
on
various
occasions
and
wondered
how
one
who
could
behave
so
well
in
common
could
thus
yield
to
temptation
on
a
particular
occasion
his
recent
attempts
his
hypocrisy
however
proved
that
his
villany
was
systematic
and
she
was
not
weak
enough
to
hide
from
herself
the
evidence
of
his
guilt
or
of
its
enormity
his
interposition
between
emily
and
death
she
attributed
now
to
natural
courage
and
perhaps
in
some
measure
to
chance
but
his
profound
and
unvarying
reverence
for
holy
things
his
consistent
charity
his
refusing
to
fight
to
what
were
they
owing
and
wilson
mourned
the
weakness
of
human
nature
while
she
acknowledged
to
her
self
there
might
be
men
qualified
by
nature
and
even
disposed
by
reason
and
grace
to
prove
ornaments
to
religion
and
the
world
who
fell
beneath
the
maddening
influence
of
their
besetting
sins
the
superficial
and
interested
vices
of
egerton
vanished
before
these
awful
and
deeply
seated
offences
of
denbigh
and
the
correct
widow
saw
at
a
glance
that
he
was
the
last
man
to
be
intrusted
with
the
happiness
of
her
niece
but
how
to
break
this
heartrending
discovery
to
emily
was
a
new
source
of
uneasiness
to
her
and
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
lodge
ere
she
had
determined
on
the
first
step
required
of
her
by
duty
her
brother
handed
her
out
and
filled
with
the
dread
that
denbigh
had
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
of
her
absence
to
press
his
suit
with
emily
she
eagerly
inquired
after
him
she
was
rejoiced
to
hear
he
had
returned
with
john
for
a
and
together
they
had
gone
in
pursuit
of
game
although
she
saw
in
it
a
convincing
proof
that
a
desire
to
avoid
fitzgerald
and
not
indisposition
had
induced
him
to
leave
as
a
last
alternative
she
resolved
to
have
the
returned
to
him
in
her
presence
in
order
to
see
if
he
acknowledged
it
to
be
his
property
and
accordingly
she
instructed
her
own
man
to
hand
it
to
him
while
at
dinner
simply
saying
he
had
lost
it
the
open
and
unsuspecting
air
with
which
her
niece
met
denbigh
on
his
return
gave
wilson
an
additional
shock
and
she
could
hardly
command
herself
sufficiently
to
extend
the
common
courtesies
of
good
breeding
to
benfield
guest
while
sitting
at
the
dessert
her
servant
handed
the
pocket
book
as
directed
by
his
mistress
to
its
owner
saying
your
i
believe
mr
denbigh
denbigh
took
the
book
and
held
it
in
his
hand
for
a
moment
in
surprise
and
then
fixed
his
eye
keenly
on
the
man
as
he
inquired
where
he
found
it
and
how
he
knew
it
was
his
these
were
interrogatories
francis
was
not
prepared
to
answer
and
in
his
confusion
he
naturally
turned
his
eyes
on
his
mistress
denbigh
followed
their
direction
with
his
own
and
in
encountering
the
looks
of
the
lady
he
asked
in
a
stammering
manner
and
with
a
face
of
scarlet
am
i
indebted
to
you
madam
for
my
property
no
sir
it
was
given
me
by
one
who
found
it
to
restore
to
you
said
wilson
gravely
and
the
subject
was
dropped
both
appearing
willing
to
say
no
more
yet
denbigh
was
abstracted
and
absent
during
the
remainder
of
the
repast
and
emily
spoke
to
him
once
or
twice
without
obtaining
an
answer
wilson
caught
his
eye
several
times
fixed
on
her
with
an
inquiring
and
doubtful
expression
that
convinced
her
he
was
alarmed
if
any
confirmation
of
his
guilt
had
been
wanting
the
consciousness
he
betrayed
during
this
scene
afforded
it
and
she
set
seriously
about
considering
the
shortest
and
best
method
of
interrupting
his
intercourse
with
emily
before
he
had
drawn
from
her
an
acknowledgment
of
her
love
chapter
xxviii
on
withdrawing
to
her
after
dinner
wilson
commenced
the
disagreeable
duty
of
removing
the
veil
from
the
eyes
of
her
niece
by
recounting
to
her
the
substance
of
fitzgerald
last
communication
to
the
innocence
of
emily
such
persecution
could
excite
no
other
sensations
than
surprise
and
horror
and
as
her
aunt
omitted
the
part
concerning
the
daughter
of
sir
edward
moseley
she
naturally
expressed
her
wonder
as
to
who
the
wretch
could
be
possibly
aunt
she
said
with
an
involuntary
shudder
some
of
the
many
gentlemen
we
have
lately
seen
and
one
who
has
had
art
enough
to
conceal
his
real
character
from
the
world
concealment
my
love
replied
wilson
would
be
hardly
necessary
such
is
the
fashionable
laxity
of
morals
that
i
doubt
not
many
of
his
associates
would
laugh
at
his
misconduct
and
that
he
would
still
continue
to
pass
with
the
world
as
an
honorable
man
and
ready
cried
her
niece
to
sacrifice
human
life
in
the
defence
of
any
ridiculous
punctilio
or
added
wilson
striving
to
draw
nearer
to
her
subject
with
a
closer
veil
of
hypocrisy
wear
even
an
affectation
of
principle
and
moral
feeling
that
would
seem
to
forbid
such
a
departure
from
duty
in
favor
of
custom
oh
no
dear
aunt
exclaimed
emily
with
glowing
cheeks
and
eyes
dancing
with
pleasure
he
would
hardly
dare
to
be
so
very
base
it
would
be
profanity
wilson
sighed
heavily
as
she
witnessed
that
confiding
esteem
which
would
not
permit
her
niece
even
to
suspect
that
an
act
which
in
denbigh
had
been
so
warmly
applauded
could
even
in
another
proceed
from
unworthy
motives
and
she
found
it
would
be
necessary
to
speak
in
the
plainest
terms
to
awaken
her
suspicions
willing
however
to
come
gradually
to
the
distressing
truth
she
replied
and
yet
my
dear
men
who
pride
themselves
greatly
on
their
morals
nay
even
some
who
wear
the
mask
of
religion
and
perhaps
deceive
themselves
admit
and
practise
this
very
appeal
to
arms
such
inconsistencies
are
by
no
means
uncommon
and
why
then
might
there
not
with
equal
probability
be
others
who
would
revolt
at
murder
and
yet
not
hesitate
being
guilty
of
lesser
enormities
this
is
in
some
measure
the
case
of
every
man
and
it
is
only
to
consider
killing
in
unlawful
encounters
as
murder
to
make
it
one
in
point
hypocrisy
is
so
mean
a
vice
i
should
not
think
a
brave
man
could
stoop
to
it
said
emily
and
julia
admits
he
was
brave
and
would
not
a
brave
man
revolt
at
the
cowardice
of
insulting
an
unprotected
woman
and
your
hero
did
that
too
replied
wilson
bitterly
losing
her
in
indignation
oh
do
not
call
him
my
hero
i
beg
of
you
dear
aunt
said
emily
starting
excited
by
so
extraordinary
an
allusion
but
instantly
losing
the
unpleasant
sensation
in
the
delightful
consciousness
of
the
superiority
of
the
man
on
whom
she
had
bestowed
her
own
admiration
in
fact
my
child
continued
her
aunt
our
natures
are
guilty
of
the
grossest
inconsistencies
the
vilest
wretch
has
generally
some
property
or
which
he
values
himself
and
the
most
perfect
are
too
often
frail
on
some
tender
point
long
and
tried
friendships
are
those
only
which
can
be
trusted
and
these
oftentimes
fail
emily
looked
at
her
aunt
in
surprise
at
hearing
her
utter
such
unusual
sentiments
for
wilson
at
the
same
time
she
had
by
divine
assistance
deeply
impressed
her
niece
with
the
frailty
of
her
nature
had
withheld
the
disgusting
representation
of
human
vices
from
her
view
as
unnecessary
to
her
situation
and
dangerous
to
her
humility
after
a
short
pause
wilson
continued
marriage
is
a
fearful
step
in
a
woman
and
one
she
is
compelled
in
some
measure
to
adventure
her
happiness
on
without
fitting
opportunities
of
judging
of
the
merit
of
the
man
she
confides
in
jane
is
an
instance
in
point
but
i
devoutly
hope
you
are
not
to
be
another
while
speaking
wilson
had
taken
the
hand
of
emily
and
by
her
looks
and
solemn
manner
she
had
succeeded
in
alarming
her
niece
although
denbigh
was
yet
furthest
from
the
thoughts
of
emily
the
aunt
reached
her
a
glass
of
water
and
willing
to
get
rid
of
the
hateful
subject
she
continued
hurriedly
did
you
not
notice
the
francis
gave
to
mr
denbigh
emily
fixed
her
inquiring
eyes
on
her
aunt
as
the
other
added
it
was
the
one
fitzgerald
gave
me
day
something
like
an
indefinite
glimpse
of
the
facts
crossed
the
mind
of
emily
and
as
it
most
obviously
involved
a
separation
from
denbigh
she
sank
lifeless
into
the
extended
arms
of
her
aunt
this
had
been
anticipated
by
wilson
and
a
timely
application
of
restoratives
soon
brought
her
back
to
a
consciousness
of
misery
wilson
unwilling
any
one
but
herself
should
witness
this
first
burst
of
grief
succeeded
in
getting
her
niece
to
her
own
room
and
in
bed
emily
made
no
lamentations
shed
no
tears
asked
no
questions
her
eye
was
fixed
and
every
faculty
appeared
oppressed
with
the
load
on
her
heart
wilson
knew
her
situation
too
well
to
intrude
with
unseasonable
consolation
or
useless
reflections
but
sat
patiently
by
her
side
waiting
anxiously
for
the
moment
she
could
be
of
service
at
length
the
uplifted
eyes
and
clasped
hands
of
emily
assured
her
she
had
not
forgotten
herself
or
her
duty
and
she
was
rewarded
for
her
labor
and
forbearance
by
a
flood
of
tears
emily
was
now
able
to
listen
to
a
more
full
statement
of
the
reasons
her
aunt
had
for
believing
in
the
guilt
of
denbigh
and
she
felt
as
if
her
heart
was
frozen
up
for
ever
as
the
proofs
followed
each
other
until
they
amounted
to
demonstration
as
there
was
some
indication
of
fever
from
her
agitated
state
of
mind
her
aunt
required
she
should
remain
in
her
room
until
morning
and
emily
feeling
every
way
unequal
to
a
meeting
with
denbigh
gladly
assented
after
ringing
for
her
maid
to
sit
in
the
adjoining
room
wilson
went
below
and
announced
to
the
family
the
indisposition
of
her
charge
and
her
desire
to
obtain
a
little
sleep
denbigh
looked
anxious
to
inquire
after
the
health
of
emily
but
there
was
a
restraint
on
all
his
actions
since
the
return
of
his
book
that
persuaded
wilson
he
apprehended
that
a
detection
of
his
conduct
had
taken
place
he
did
venture
to
ask
when
they
were
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
miss
moseley
again
hoping
it
would
be
that
evening
as
he
had
fixed
the
morning
for
his
departure
and
when
he
learnt
that
emily
had
retired
for
the
night
his
anxiety
was
sensibly
increased
and
he
instantly
withdrew
wilson
was
alone
in
the
and
about
to
join
her
niece
as
denbigh
entered
it
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
he
approached
her
with
a
diffident
and
constrained
manner
and
commenced
the
following
dialogue
my
anxiety
and
situation
will
plead
my
apology
for
troubling
miss
moseley
at
this
time
may
i
ask
you
madam
to
deliver
this
letter
i
hardly
dare
ask
you
for
your
good
offices
wilson
took
the
letter
and
coldly
replied
certainly
sir
and
i
sincerely
wish
i
could
be
of
any
real
service
to
you
i
perceive
madam
said
denbigh
like
one
that
was
choking
i
have
forfeited
your
good
opinion
that
pocket
book
has
made
a
dreadful
discovery
said
wilson
shuddering
will
not
one
offence
be
pardoned
dear
madam
cried
denbigh
with
warmth
if
you
knew
my
circumstances
the
cruel
reasons
why
why
did
i
neglect
the
paternal
advice
of
doctor
ives
it
is
not
yet
too
late
sir
said
wilson
more
mildly
for
your
own
good
as
for
us
your
deception
is
unpardonable
i
see
it
i
feel
it
cried
he
in
the
accent
of
despair
yet
emily
emily
may
relent
you
will
at
least
give
her
my
letter
anything
is
better
than
this
suspense
you
shall
have
an
answer
from
emily
this
evening
and
one
entirely
unbiassed
by
me
said
wilson
as
she
closed
the
door
she
observed
denbigh
gazing
on
her
retiring
figure
with
a
countenance
of
despair
that
caused
a
feeling
of
pity
to
mingle
with
her
detestation
of
his
vices
on
opening
the
door
of
emily
room
wilson
found
her
niece
in
tears
and
her
anxiety
for
her
health
was
alleviated
she
knew
or
hoped
that
if
she
could
once
call
in
the
assistance
of
her
judgment
and
piety
to
lessen
her
sorrows
emily
however
she
might
mourn
would
become
resigned
to
her
situation
and
the
first
step
to
attain
this
was
the
exercise
of
those
faculties
which
had
been
as
it
were
momentarily
annihilated
wilson
kissed
her
niece
with
tenderness
as
she
placed
the
letter
in
her
hand
and
told
her
she
would
call
for
her
answer
within
an
hour
employment
and
the
necessity
of
acting
would
she
thought
be
the
surest
means
of
reviving
her
energies
nor
was
she
disappointed
when
the
aunt
returned
for
the
expected
answer
she
was
informed
by
the
maid
in
the
that
miss
moseley
was
up
and
had
been
writing
on
entering
wilson
stood
a
moment
in
admiration
of
the
picture
before
her
emily
was
on
her
knees
and
by
her
side
on
the
carpet
lay
the
letter
and
its
answer
her
face
was
hid
by
her
hair
and
her
hands
were
closed
in
the
fervent
grasp
of
petition
in
a
minute
she
rose
and
approaching
her
aunt
with
an
air
of
profound
resignation
but
great
steadiness
she
handed
her
the
letters
her
own
unsealed
read
them
madam
and
if
you
approve
of
mine
i
will
thank
you
to
deliver
it
her
aunt
folded
her
in
her
arms
until
emily
finding
herself
yielding
under
the
effects
of
sympathy
begged
to
be
left
alone
on
withdrawing
to
her
own
room
wilson
read
the
contents
of
the
two
letters
i
rely
greatly
on
the
goodness
of
miss
moseley
to
pardon
the
liberty
i
am
taking
at
a
moment
she
is
so
unfit
for
such
a
subject
but
my
departure
my
feelings
must
plead
my
apology
from
the
moment
of
my
first
acquaintance
with
you
i
have
been
a
cheerful
subject
to
your
loveliness
and
innocence
i
feel
i
know
i
am
not
deserving
of
such
a
blessing
but
since
knowing
you
as
i
do
it
is
impossible
not
to
strive
to
win
you
you
have
often
thanked
me
as
the
preserver
of
your
life
but
you
little
knew
the
deep
interest
i
had
in
its
safety
without
it
my
own
would
be
valueless
by
accepting
my
offered
hand
you
will
place
me
amongst
the
happiest
or
by
rejecting
it
the
most
wretched
of
men
to
this
note
which
was
unsigned
and
evidently
written
under
great
agitation
of
mind
emily
the
following
reply
sir
it
is
with
much
regret
that
i
find
myself
reduced
to
the
possibility
of
giving
uneasiness
to
one
to
whom
i
am
under
such
heavy
obligations
it
will
never
be
in
my
power
to
accept
the
honor
you
have
offered
me
and
i
beg
you
to
receive
my
thanks
for
the
compliment
conveyed
in
your
request
as
well
as
my
good
wishes
for
your
happiness
in
future
and
fervent
prayers
that
you
may
be
ever
found
worthy
of
it
your
humble
servant
emily
moseley
perfectly
satisfied
with
this
answer
wilson
went
below
in
order
to
deliver
it
at
once
she
thought
it
probable
as
denbigh
had
already
sent
his
baggage
to
a
tavern
preparatory
to
his
intended
journey
they
would
not
meet
again
and
as
she
felt
a
strong
wish
both
on
account
of
doctor
ives
and
out
of
respect
to
the
services
of
the
young
man
himself
to
conceal
his
conduct
from
the
world
entirely
she
was
in
hopes
that
his
absence
might
make
any
disclosure
unnecessary
he
took
the
letter
from
her
with
a
trembling
hand
and
casting
one
of
his
very
expressive
looks
at
her
as
if
to
read
her
thoughts
he
withdrew
emily
had
fallen
asleep
free
from
fever
and
wilson
had
descended
to
the
when
benfield
was
first
struck
with
the
absence
of
his
favorite
an
inquiry
after
denbigh
was
instituted
and
while
they
were
waiting
his
appearance
a
servant
handed
the
old
man
a
note
from
whom
cried
benfield
in
surprise
denbigh
sir
said
the
servant
mr
denbigh
exclaimed
benfield
no
accident
i
hope
i
remember
when
lord
gosford
here
peter
your
eyes
are
young
read
it
for
me
read
it
aloud
as
all
but
wilson
were
anxiously
waiting
to
know
the
meaning
of
this
message
and
peter
had
many
preparations
to
go
through
before
his
youthful
eyes
could
make
out
the
contents
john
hastily
caught
the
letter
out
of
his
hand
saying
he
would
save
him
the
trouble
and
in
obedience
to
his
uncle
wishes
he
read
aloud
denbigh
being
under
the
necessity
of
leaving
l
immediately
and
unable
to
endure
the
pain
of
taking
leave
avails
himself
of
this
means
of
tendering
his
warmest
thanks
to
benfield
for
his
hospitality
and
to
his
amiable
guests
for
their
many
kindnesses
as
he
contemplates
leaving
england
he
desires
to
wish
them
all
a
long
and
an
affectionate
farewell
farewell
cried
benfield
farewell
does
he
say
farewell
john
here
peter
run
no
you
are
too
old
john
run
bring
my
hat
i
go
myself
to
the
village
some
emmy
sick
and
denbigh
going
away
yes
yes
i
did
so
myself
lady
juliana
poor
dear
soul
she
was
a
long
time
before
she
could
forget
it
but
peter
peter
had
disappeared
the
instant
the
letter
was
finished
and
he
was
quickly
followed
by
john
sir
edward
and
lady
moseley
were
lost
in
amazement
at
this
sudden
and
unexpected
movement
of
denbigh
and
the
breast
of
each
of
the
affectionate
parents
was
filled
with
a
vague
apprehension
that
the
peace
of
mind
of
another
child
was
at
stake
jane
felt
a
renewal
of
her
woes
in
the
anticipation
of
something
similar
for
her
sister
for
the
fancy
of
jane
was
yet
active
and
she
did
not
cease
to
consider
the
defection
of
egerton
a
kind
of
unmerited
misfortune
and
fatality
instead
of
a
probable
consequence
of
want
of
principle
like
benfield
she
was
in
danger
of
raising
an
ideal
idol
and
of
spending
the
remainder
of
her
days
in
devotion
to
qualities
rarely
if
ever
found
identified
with
a
person
that
never
had
existed
the
old
gentleman
was
entirely
engrossed
by
a
different
object
and
having
in
his
own
opinion
decided
there
must
have
been
one
of
those
misunderstandings
which
sometimes
had
occurred
to
himself
and
lady
juliana
he
quietly
composed
himself
to
eat
his
salad
at
the
supper
table
on
turning
his
head
however
in
quest
of
his
first
glass
of
wine
he
observed
peter
standing
quietly
by
the
sideboard
with
the
favorite
goggles
over
his
eyes
now
peter
was
troubled
with
two
kinds
of
debility
about
his
organs
of
vision
one
was
age
and
natural
weakness
while
the
other
proceeded
more
directly
from
the
heart
his
master
knew
of
these
facts
and
he
took
the
alarm
again
the
dropped
from
his
nerveless
hand
as
he
said
in
a
trembling
tone
peter
i
thought
you
went
yes
master
said
peter
laconically
you
saw
him
peter
will
he
return
peter
was
busily
occupied
at
his
glasses
although
no
one
was
dry
peter
repeated
benfield
rising
from
his
seat
is
he
coming
in
time
for
supper
peter
was
obliged
to
reply
and
deliberately
uncasing
his
eyes
and
blowing
his
nose
he
was
on
the
point
of
opening
his
mouth
as
john
came
into
the
room
and
threw
himself
into
a
chair
with
an
air
of
great
vexation
peter
pointed
to
the
young
gentleman
in
silence
and
retired
john
cried
sir
edward
where
is
denbigh
gone
sir
gone
yes
my
dear
father
said
john
gone
without
saying
to
one
of
us
without
telling
us
whither
or
when
to
return
it
was
cruel
in
him
unkind
i
never
forgive
him
and
john
whose
feelings
were
strong
and
unusually
excited
hid
his
face
between
his
hands
on
the
as
he
raised
his
head
to
reply
to
a
question
of
benfield
of
how
he
knew
he
had
gone
for
the
coach
did
not
go
until
daylight
wilson
saw
evident
marks
of
tears
such
proofs
of
emotion
in
one
like
john
moseley
gave
her
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
if
she
had
been
deceived
it
was
by
a
concurrence
of
circumstances
and
a
depth
of
hypocrisy
almost
exceeding
belief
added
less
than
common
therefore
to
the
uneasiness
of
the
moment
i
saw
the
innkeeper
uncle
said
john
who
told
me
that
denbigh
left
there
at
eight
in
a
and
four
but
i
will
go
to
london
in
the
morning
myself
this
was
no
sooner
said
than
it
was
corroborated
by
acts
for
the
young
man
immediately
commenced
his
preparations
for
the
journey
the
family
separated
that
evening
with
melancholy
hearts
and
the
host
and
his
privy
counsellor
were
closeted
for
half
an
hour
ere
they
retired
to
their
night
repose
john
took
his
leave
of
them
and
left
the
lodge
for
the
inn
with
his
man
in
order
to
be
ready
for
the
mail
wilson
looked
in
upon
emily
before
she
withdrew
herself
and
found
her
awake
but
perfectly
calm
and
composed
she
said
but
little
appearing
desirous
of
avoiding
all
allusions
to
denbigh
and
after
her
aunt
had
simply
acquainted
her
with
his
departure
and
her
resolution
to
conceal
the
cause
the
subject
was
dropped
wilson
on
entering
her
own
room
thought
deeply
on
the
discoveries
of
the
day
they
had
interfered
with
her
favorite
system
of
morals
baffled
her
ablest
calculations
upon
causes
and
effects
but
in
no
degree
had
impaired
her
faith
or
reliance
on
providence
she
knew
one
exception
did
not
destroy
a
rule
she
was
certain
without
principles
there
was
no
security
for
good
conduct
and
the
case
of
denbigh
proved
it
to
discover
these
principles
might
be
difficult
but
was
a
task
imperiously
required
at
her
hands
as
she
believed
ere
she
yielded
the
present
and
future
happiness
of
her
pupil
to
the
power
of
any
man
chapter
xxix
the
day
had
not
yet
dawned
when
john
moseley
was
summoned
to
take
his
seat
in
the
mail
for
london
three
of
the
places
were
already
occupied
and
john
was
compelled
to
get
a
seat
for
his
man
on
the
outside
an
intercourse
with
strangers
is
particularly
irksome
to
an
englishman
and
none
appeared
disposed
for
a
long
time
to
break
the
silence
the
coach
had
left
the
little
village
of
l
far
behind
it
before
any
of
the
rational
beings
it
contained
thought
it
prudent
or
becoming
to
bend
in
the
least
to
the
charities
of
our
nature
in
a
communication
with
a
fellow
creature
of
whose
name
or
condition
he
happened
to
be
ignorant
this
reserve
is
unquestionably
characteristic
of
the
nation
to
what
is
it
owing
modesty
did
not
national
and
deep
personal
vanity
appear
at
once
to
refute
the
assertion
we
might
enter
into
an
investigation
of
it
the
good
opinion
of
himself
in
an
englishman
is
more
deeply
seated
though
less
buoyant
than
that
of
his
neighbors
in
them
it
is
more
of
manner
in
us
more
of
feeling
and
the
wound
inflicted
on
the
of
the
two
is
very
different
the
frenchman
wonders
at
its
rudeness
but
soon
forgets
the
charge
while
an
englishmam
broods
over
it
in
silence
and
mortification
it
is
said
this
distinction
in
character
is
owing
to
the
different
estimation
of
principles
and
morals
in
the
two
nations
the
solidity
and
purity
of
our
ethics
and
religious
creeds
may
have
given
a
superior
tone
to
our
moral
feeling
but
has
that
man
a
tenable
ground
to
value
himself
on
either
whose
respect
to
sacred
things
grows
out
of
a
respect
to
himself
on
the
other
hand
is
not
humility
the
very
foundation
of
the
real
christian
for
our
part
we
should
be
glad
to
see
this
national
reserve
lessened
if
not
done
entirely
away
we
believe
it
is
founded
in
pride
and
uncharitableness
and
could
wish
to
see
men
thrown
accidentally
together
on
the
roads
of
the
country
mindful
that
they
are
also
travelling
in
company
the
highway
of
life
and
that
the
goal
of
their
destination
is
equally
attainable
by
all
john
moseley
was
occupied
with
thoughts
very
different
from
those
of
any
of
his
as
they
proceeded
rapidly
on
their
route
and
it
was
only
when
roused
from
his
meditations
by
accidentally
coming
in
contact
with
the
hilt
of
a
sword
that
he
looked
up
and
in
the
glimmerings
of
the
morning
light
recognised
the
person
of
lord
henry
stapleton
their
eyes
met
and
my
lord
moseley
were
repeated
in
mutual
surprise
john
was
eminently
a
social
being
and
he
was
happy
to
find
recourse
against
his
gloomy
thoughts
in
the
conversation
of
the
dashing
young
sailor
the
frigate
of
the
other
had
entered
the
bay
the
night
before
and
he
was
going
to
town
to
the
wedding
of
his
sister
the
coach
of
his
brother
the
marquis
was
to
meet
him
about
twenty
miles
from
town
and
the
ship
was
ordered
round
to
yarmouth
where
he
was
to
rejoin
her
but
how
are
your
lovely
sisters
moseley
cried
the
young
sailor
in
a
frank
and
careless
manner
i
should
have
been
half
in
love
with
one
of
them
if
i
had
time
and
money
both
are
necessary
to
marriage
nowadays
you
know
as
to
time
said
john
with
a
laugh
i
believe
that
may
be
dispensed
with
though
money
is
certainly
a
different
thing
oh
time
too
replied
his
lordship
i
have
never
time
enough
to
do
anything
as
it
ought
to
be
done
always
hurried
i
wish
you
could
recommend
to
me
a
lady
who
would
take
the
trouble
off
my
hands
it
might
be
done
said
john
with
a
smile
and
the
image
of
kate
chatterton
crossed
his
brain
but
it
was
soon
succeeded
by
that
of
her
more
lovely
sister
but
how
do
you
manage
on
board
your
ship
hurried
there
too
oh
never
there
replied
the
captain
gravely
that
duty
you
know
and
everything
must
be
regular
of
course
on
shore
it
is
a
different
thing
there
i
am
only
a
passenger
l
has
a
charming
society
moseley
a
week
or
ten
days
ago
i
was
shooting
and
came
to
a
beautiful
cottage
about
five
miles
from
the
village
that
was
the
abode
of
a
much
more
beautiful
woman
a
spaniard
a
fitzgerald
i
am
positively
in
love
with
her
so
soft
so
polished
so
modest
how
came
you
acquainted
with
her
inquired
moseley
interrupting
him
in
a
little
surprise
chance
my
dear
fellow
chance
i
was
thirsty
and
approached
for
a
drink
of
water
she
was
sitting
in
the
veranda
and
being
hurried
for
time
you
know
it
saved
the
trouble
of
introduction
i
fancy
she
is
troubled
with
the
same
complaint
for
she
managed
to
get
rid
of
me
in
no
time
and
with
a
great
deal
of
politeness
i
found
out
her
name
however
at
the
next
house
during
this
rattling
talk
john
had
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
face
of
one
of
the
passengers
who
sat
opposite
to
him
the
stranger
appeared
to
be
about
fifty
years
of
age
strongly
with
a
stiff
military
air
and
had
the
dress
and
exterior
of
a
gentlemen
his
face
was
much
though
naturally
very
fair
and
his
dark
keen
eye
was
intently
fixed
on
the
sailor
as
he
continued
his
remarks
do
you
know
such
a
lady
moseley
yes
said
john
though
very
slightly
she
is
visited
by
one
of
my
sisters
and
yourself
cried
lord
henry
with
a
laugh
myself
once
or
twice
my
lord
certainly
answered
john
gravely
but
a
lady
visited
by
emily
moseley
and
wilson
is
a
proper
companion
for
any
one
fitzgerald
is
very
retired
in
her
manner
of
living
and
chance
made
us
acquainted
but
not
being
like
your
lordship
in
want
of
time
we
have
endeavored
to
cultivate
her
society
as
we
have
found
it
very
agreeable
the
countenance
of
the
stranger
underwent
several
changes
during
this
speech
of
john
and
at
its
close
his
eyes
rested
on
him
with
a
softer
expression
than
generally
marked
its
rigid
and
compressed
muscles
willing
to
change
a
discourse
that
was
growing
too
particular
for
a
john
addressed
himself
to
the
opposite
passengers
while
his
eye
yet
dwelt
on
the
face
of
the
military
stranger
we
are
likely
to
have
a
fine
day
gentlemen
the
soldier
bowed
stiffly
as
he
smiled
his
assent
and
the
other
passenger
humbly
answered
very
john
in
the
well
known
tones
of
honest
peter
johnson
moseley
started
as
he
turned
his
face
for
the
first
time
on
the
lank
figure
which
was
modestly
compressed
into
the
smallest
possible
compass
in
the
corner
of
the
coach
in
a
way
not
to
come
in
contact
with
any
of
its
neighbors
johnson
exclaimed
john
in
astonishment
you
here
where
are
you
going
to
london
to
london
john
replied
peter
with
a
look
of
much
importance
and
then
by
way
of
silencing
further
interrogatories
he
added
on
my
master
business
sir
both
moseley
and
lord
henry
examined
him
closely
the
former
wondering
what
could
take
the
steward
at
the
age
of
seventy
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
into
the
vortex
of
the
capital
and
the
latter
in
admiration
at
this
figure
and
equipments
of
the
old
man
peter
was
in
full
costume
with
the
exception
of
the
goggles
and
was
in
reality
a
subject
to
be
gazed
at
but
nothing
relaxed
the
muscles
or
attracted
the
particular
notice
of
the
soldier
who
having
regained
his
set
form
of
countenance
appeared
drawn
up
in
himself
waiting
patiently
for
the
moment
he
was
expected
to
act
nor
did
he
utter
more
than
as
many
words
in
the
course
of
the
first
fifty
miles
of
their
journey
his
dialect
was
singular
and
such
as
put
his
hearers
at
a
loss
to
determine
his
country
lord
henry
stared
at
him
every
time
he
spoke
as
if
to
say
what
countryman
are
you
until
at
length
he
suggested
to
john
he
was
some
officer
whom
the
downfall
of
bonaparte
had
driven
into
retirement
indeed
moseley
he
added
as
they
were
about
to
resume
their
carriage
after
a
change
of
horses
we
must
draw
him
out
and
see
what
he
thinks
of
his
master
now
delicately
you
know
the
soldier
was
however
impervious
to
his
lordship
attacks
until
the
project
was
finally
abandoned
in
despair
as
peter
was
much
too
modest
to
talk
in
the
presence
of
john
moseley
and
a
lord
the
young
men
had
most
of
the
discourse
to
themselves
at
a
village
fifteen
miles
from
london
a
fashionable
carriage
and
four
with
the
coronet
of
a
marquis
was
in
waiting
for
lord
henry
john
refused
his
invitation
to
take
a
seat
with
him
to
town
for
he
had
traced
denbigh
from
stage
to
stage
and
was
fearful
of
losing
sight
of
him
unless
he
persevered
in
the
manner
he
had
commenced
peter
and
he
accordingly
were
put
down
safely
at
an
inn
in
the
strand
and
moseley
hastened
to
make
his
inquiries
after
the
object
of
his
pursuit
such
a
chaise
had
arrived
an
hour
before
and
the
gentleman
had
ordered
his
trunk
to
a
neighboring
hotel
after
obtaining
the
address
and
ordering
a
hackney
coach
he
hastened
to
the
house
but
on
inquiring
for
denbigh
to
his
great
mortification
was
told
they
knew
of
no
such
gentleman
john
turned
away
from
the
person
he
was
speaking
to
in
visible
disappointment
when
a
servant
respectfully
inquired
if
the
gentleman
had
not
come
from
l
in
norfolk
that
day
he
had
was
the
reply
then
follow
me
sir
if
you
please
they
knocked
at
a
door
of
one
of
the
parlors
and
the
servant
entered
he
returned
and
john
was
shown
into
a
room
where
denbigh
was
sitting
with
his
head
resting
on
his
hand
and
apparently
musing
on
seeing
who
required
admittance
he
sprang
from
his
seat
and
exclaimed
moseley
do
i
see
aright
denbigh
cried
john
stretching
out
his
hand
to
him
was
this
kind
was
it
like
yourself
to
leave
us
so
unexpectedly
and
for
so
long
a
time
too
as
your
note
mentioned
denbigh
waved
his
hand
to
the
servant
to
retire
and
handed
a
chair
to
his
friend
moseley
said
he
struggling
with
his
feelings
you
appear
ignorant
of
my
proposals
to
your
sister
perfectly
answered
the
amazed
john
and
her
rejection
of
them
is
it
possible
cried
the
brother
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
i
acknowledge
i
did
expect
you
to
offer
but
not
to
be
refused
denbigh
placed
in
the
other
hand
the
letter
of
emily
which
having
read
john
returned
with
a
sigh
this
then
is
the
reason
you
left
us
he
continued
emily
is
not
capricious
it
can
not
be
a
sudden
pique
she
means
as
she
says
yes
moseley
said
denbigh
mournfully
your
sister
is
i
am
not
worthy
of
her
my
deception
here
the
door
again
opened
to
the
admission
of
peter
johnson
both
the
gentlemen
rose
at
this
sudden
interruption
and
the
steward
advancing
to
the
table
once
more
produced
the
formidable
the
spectacles
and
a
letter
he
ran
over
its
direction
for
george
denbigh
esquire
london
by
the
hands
of
peter
johnson
with
care
and
speed
after
the
observance
of
these
preliminaries
he
delivered
the
missive
to
its
lawful
owner
who
opened
it
and
rapidly
perused
its
contents
denbigh
was
much
affected
with
whatever
the
latter
might
be
and
kindly
took
the
steward
by
the
hand
as
he
thanked
him
for
this
renewed
instance
of
the
interest
he
took
in
him
if
he
would
tell
him
where
a
letter
would
find
him
in
the
morning
he
would
send
a
reply
to
the
one
he
had
received
peter
gave
his
address
but
appeared
unwilling
to
go
until
assured
again
and
again
that
the
answer
would
be
infallibly
sent
taking
a
small
out
of
his
pocket
and
referring
to
its
contents
the
steward
said
master
has
with
coutts
in
the
bank
it
can
be
easily
done
sir
and
never
felt
by
us
denbigh
smiled
in
reply
as
he
assured
the
steward
he
would
take
proper
notice
of
his
master
offers
in
his
own
answer
the
door
again
opened
and
the
military
stranger
was
admitted
to
their
presence
he
bowed
appeared
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
two
of
his
companions
there
and
handed
denbigh
a
letter
in
quite
as
formal
although
in
a
more
silent
manner
than
the
steward
the
soldier
was
invited
to
be
seated
and
the
letter
was
perused
with
an
evident
curiosity
on
the
part
of
denbigh
as
soon
as
the
latter
ended
it
he
addressed
the
stranger
in
a
language
which
john
rightly
judged
to
be
spanish
and
peter
took
to
be
greek
for
a
few
minutes
the
conversation
was
maintained
between
them
with
great
earnestness
his
fellow
travellers
marvelling
much
at
the
garrulity
of
the
soldier
however
the
stranger
soon
rose
to
retire
when
the
door
thrown
open
for
the
fourth
time
and
a
voice
cried
out
here
i
am
george
safe
and
sound
ready
to
kiss
the
bridesmaids
if
they
will
let
me
and
i
can
find
time
bless
me
moseley
old
general
whew
where
is
the
coachman
and
guard
it
was
lord
henry
stapleton
the
spaniard
bowed
again
in
silence
and
withdrew
while
denbigh
threw
open
the
door
of
an
adjoining
room
and
excused
himself
as
he
desired
lord
henry
to
walk
in
there
for
a
few
minutes
upon
my
word
cried
the
heedless
sailor
as
he
complied
we
might
as
well
have
stuck
together
moseley
we
were
bound
to
one
port
it
seems
you
know
lord
henry
said
john
as
he
withdrew
yes
said
denbigh
and
he
again
required
his
address
of
peter
which
having
been
given
the
steward
departed
the
conversation
between
the
two
friends
did
not
return
to
the
course
it
was
taking
when
they
were
interrupted
as
moseley
felt
a
delicacy
in
making
any
allusion
to
the
probable
cause
of
his
sister
refusal
he
had
however
begun
to
hope
it
was
not
irremovable
and
with
the
determination
of
renewing
his
visit
in
the
morning
he
took
his
leave
to
allow
denbigh
to
attend
to
his
other
guest
lord
henry
stapleton
about
twelve
on
the
following
morning
john
and
the
steward
met
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
where
denbigh
lodged
in
quest
of
the
same
person
the
latter
held
in
his
hand
the
answer
to
his
master
letter
but
wished
particularly
to
see
its
writer
on
inquiring
to
their
mutual
surprise
they
were
told
that
the
gentleman
had
left
there
early
in
the
morning
having
discharged
his
lodgings
and
that
they
were
unable
to
say
whither
he
had
gone
to
hunt
for
a
man
without
a
clew
in
the
city
of
london
is
usually
time
misspent
of
this
moseley
was
perfectly
sensible
and
disregarding
a
proposition
of
peter
he
returned
to
his
own
lodgings
the
proposal
of
the
steward
if
it
did
not
do
much
credit
to
his
sagacity
was
much
in
favor
of
his
perseverance
and
enterprise
it
was
no
other
than
that
john
should
take
one
side
of
the
street
and
he
the
other
in
order
to
inquire
at
every
house
in
the
place
until
the
fugitive
was
discovered
sir
said
peter
with
great
simplicity
when
our
neighbor
white
lost
his
little
girl
this
was
the
way
we
found
her
although
we
went
nearly
through
l
before
we
succeeded
mr
john
peter
was
obliged
to
abandon
this
expedient
for
want
of
an
associate
and
as
no
message
was
left
at
the
lodgings
of
moseley
he
started
with
a
heavy
heart
on
his
return
to
benfield
lodge
but
moseley
zeal
was
too
warm
in
the
cause
of
his
friend
notwithstanding
his
unmerited
desertion
to
discontinue
the
search
for
him
he
sought
out
the
town
residence
of
the
marquess
of
eltringham
the
brother
of
lord
henry
and
was
told
that
both
the
marquess
and
his
brother
had
left
town
early
that
morning
for
his
seat
in
devonshire
to
attend
the
wedding
of
their
sister
did
they
go
alone
asked
john
musing
there
were
two
chaises
the
marquess
and
his
grace
who
was
his
grace
inquired
john
why
the
duke
of
derwent
to
be
sure
and
the
duke
was
he
alone
there
was
a
gentleman
with
his
grace
but
they
did
not
know
his
name
as
nothing
further
could
be
learnt
john
withdrew
a
good
deal
of
irritation
mixed
with
the
vexation
of
moseley
at
his
disappointment
for
denbigh
he
thought
too
evidently
wished
to
avoid
him
that
he
was
the
companion
of
his
kinsman
the
duke
of
derwent
he
had
now
no
doubt
and
he
entirely
relinquished
all
expectations
of
finding
him
in
london
or
its
environs
while
retracing
his
steps
in
no
enviable
state
of
mind
to
his
lodgings
with
a
resolution
of
returning
immediately
to
l
his
arm
was
suddenly
taken
by
his
friend
chatterton
if
any
man
could
have
consoled
john
at
that
moment
it
was
the
baron
questions
and
answers
were
rapidly
exchanged
between
them
and
with
increased
satisfaction
john
learnt
that
in
the
next
square
he
could
have
the
pleasure
of
paying
his
respects
to
his
kinswoman
the
dowager
lady
chatterton
and
her
two
daughters
chatterton
inquired
warmly
after
emily
and
in
a
particularly
kind
manner
concerning
denbigh
hearing
with
undisguised
astonishment
the
absence
of
the
latter
from
the
moseley
family
lady
chatterton
had
disciplined
her
feelings
upon
the
subject
of
grace
and
john
into
such
a
state
of
subordination
that
the
fastidious
jealousy
of
the
young
man
now
found
no
ground
of
alarm
in
anything
she
said
or
did
it
can
not
be
denied
the
dowager
was
delighted
to
see
him
again
and
if
it
were
fair
to
draw
any
conclusions
from
coloring
palpitations
and
other
such
little
accompaniments
of
female
feeling
grace
was
not
excessively
sorry
it
is
true
it
was
the
best
possible
opportunity
to
ascertain
all
about
her
friend
emily
and
the
rest
of
the
family
and
grace
was
extremely
happy
to
have
intelligence
of
their
general
welfare
so
direct
as
was
afforded
by
this
visit
of
moseley
grace
looked
all
she
expressed
and
possibly
a
little
more
and
john
thought
he
looked
very
beautiful
there
was
present
an
elderly
gentleman
of
apparently
indifferent
health
although
his
manners
were
extremely
lively
and
his
dress
particularly
studied
a
few
minutes
observation
convinced
moseley
this
gentleman
was
a
candidate
for
the
favor
of
kate
and
a
game
of
chess
being
soon
introduced
he
also
saw
he
was
one
thought
worthy
of
peculiar
care
and
attention
he
had
been
introduced
to
him
as
lord
herriefield
and
soon
discovered
by
his
conversation
that
he
was
a
peer
who
promised
little
towards
rendering
the
house
of
incurables
more
convalescent
than
it
was
before
his
admission
chatterton
mentioned
him
as
a
distant
connexion
of
his
mother
a
gentleman
who
had
lately
returned
from
filling
an
official
situation
in
the
east
indies
to
take
his
seat
among
the
lords
by
the
death
of
his
brother
he
was
a
bachelor
and
reputed
rich
much
of
his
wealth
being
personal
property
acquired
by
himself
abroad
the
dutiful
son
might
have
added
if
respect
and
feeling
had
not
kept
him
silent
that
his
offers
of
settling
a
large
jointure
upon
his
elder
sister
had
been
accepted
and
that
the
following
week
was
to
make
her
the
bride
of
the
emaciated
debauchee
who
now
sat
by
her
side
he
might
also
have
said
that
when
the

made
to

both
had
shrunk
from
the

disgust

that
both
had
united
in
humble
though
vain

to

chapter
xxx
a
day
elapsed
between
the
departure
of
denbigh
and
the
reappearance
of
emily
amongst
her
friends
an
indifferent
observer
would
have
thought
her
much
graver
and
less
animated
than
usual
a
loss
of
the
rich
color
which
ordinarily
glowed
on
her
healthful
cheek
might
be
noticed
but
the
placid
sweetness
and
graceful
composure
which
regulated
her
former
conduct
pervaded
all
she
did
or
uttered
not
so
with
jane
her
pride
had
suffered
more
than
her
feelings
her
imagination
had
been
more
deceived
than
her
judgment
and
although
too
well
bred
and
soft
by
nature
to
become
rude
or
captious
she
was
changed
from
a
communicative
to
a
reserved
from
a
confiding
to
a
suspicious
companion
her
parents
noticed
this
alteration
with
an
uneasiness
that
was
somewhat
embittered
by
the
consciousness
of
a
neglect
of
some
of
those
duties
that
experience
now
seemed
to
indicate
could
never
be
forgotten
with
impunity
francis
and
clara
had
arrived
from
their
northern
tour
so
happy
in
each
other
and
so
contented
with
their
lot
that
it
required
some
little
exercise
of
fortitude
in
both
lady
moseley
and
her
daughters
to
expel
unpleasant
recollections
while
they
contemplated
it
their
relation
of
the
little
incidents
of
their
tour
had
however
an
effect
to
withdraw
the
attention
of
their
friends
in
some
degree
from
late
occurrences
and
a
melancholy
and
sympathizing
kind
of
association
had
taken
place
of
the
unbounded
confidence
and
gaiety
which
so
lately
prevailed
at
benfield
lodge
benfield
mingled
with
his
solemnity
an
air
of
mystery
and
he
was
frequently
noticed
by
his
relatives
looking
over
old
papers
and
was
apparently
employed
in
preparations
that
indicated
movements
of
more
than
usual
importance
the
family
were
collected
in
one
of
the
parlors
on
an
extremely
unpleasant
day
the
fourth
after
the
departure
of
john
when
the
thin
person
of
johnson
stalked
in
amongst
them
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
in
expectation
of
what
he
had
to
communicate
and
all
apparently
dreading
to
break
the
silence
from
an
apprehension
that
his
communication
would
be
unpleasant
in
the
meantime
peter
who
had
respectfully
left
his
hat
at
the
door
proceeded
to
uncase
his
body
from
the
multiplied
defences
he
had
taken
against
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
his
master
stood
erect
with
an
outstretched
hand
ready
to
receive
the
reply
to
his
epistle
and
johnson
having
liberated
his
body
from
thraldom
produced
the
black
leathern
and
from
its
contents
a
letter
when
he
read
aloud
roderic
benfield
benfield
lodge
norfolk
favored
by
here
peter
modesty
got
the
better
of
his
method
he
had
never
been
called
johnson
by
anybody
old
or
young
all
knew
him
in
that
neighborhood
as
peter
johnson
and
he
had
very
nearly
been
guilty
of
the
temerity
of
arrogating
to
himself
another
title
in
the
presence
of
those
he
most
respected
a
degree
of
from
which
he
escaped
with
the
loss
of
a
small
piece
of
his
tongue
benfield
took
the
letter
with
an
eagerness
that
plainly
indicated
the
deep
interest
he
took
in
its
contents
while
emily
with
a
tremulous
voice
and
flushed
cheek
approached
the
steward
with
a
glass
of
wine
peter
she
said
take
this
it
will
do
you
good
thank
you
miss
emma
said
peter
casting
his
eyes
from
her
to
his
master
as
the
latter
having
finished
his
letter
exclaimed
with
a
strange
mixture
of
consideration
and
disappointment
johnson
you
must
change
your
clothes
immediately
or
you
will
take
cold
you
look
now
like
old
moses
the
jew
beggar
peter
sighed
heavily
at
this
comparison
and
saw
in
it
a
confirmation
of
his
fears
for
he
well
knew
that
to
his
being
the
bearer
of
unpleasant
tidings
was
he
indebted
for
a
resemblance
to
anything
unpleasant
to
his
master
and
moses
was
the
old
gentleman
aversion
the
baronet
now
followed
his
uncle
from
the
room
to
his
library
entering
it
at
the
same
moment
with
the
steward
who
had
been
summoned
by
his
master
to
an
audience
pointing
to
a
chair
for
his
nephew
benfield
commenced
the
discourse
with
saying
peter
you
saw
denbigh
how
did
he
look
as
usual
master
said
peter
laconically
still
piqued
at
being
likened
to
old
moses
and
what
did
he
say
to
the
offer
did
he
not
make
any
comments
on
it
he
was
not
offended
at
it
i
hope
demanded
benfield
he
said
nothing
but
what
he
has
written
to
your
honor
replied
the
steward
losing
a
little
of
his
constrained
manner
in
real
good
feeling
to
his
master
may
i
ask
what
the
offer
was
inquired
sir
edward
benfield
regarding
him
a
moment
in
silence
said
certainly
you
are
nearly
concerned
in
his
welfare
your
daughter
the
old
man
stopped
turned
to
his
and
handed
the
baronet
a
copy
of
the
epistle
he
had
sent
to
denbigh
it
read
as
follows
dear
friend
denbigh
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
on
the
reason
of
your
sudden
departure
from
a
house
i
had
begun
to
hope
you
thought
your
own
and
by
calling
to
mind
my
own
feelings
when
lady
juliana
became
the
heiress
to
her
estate
take
it
for
granted
you
have
been
governed
by
the
same
sentiments
which
i
know
both
by
my
own
experience
and
that
of
the
bearer
peter
johnson
is
a
accompaniment
of
pure
affection
yes
my
dear
denbigh
i
honor
your
delicacy
in
not
wishing
to
become
indebted
to
a
stranger
as
it
were
for
the
money
on
which
you
subsist
and
that
stranger
your
wife
who
ought
in
reason
to
look
up
to
you
instead
of
your
looking
up
to
her
which
was
the
true
cause
lord
gosford
would
not
marry
the
countess
on
account
of
her
great
wealth
as
he
assured
me
himself
notwithstanding
envious
people
said
it
was
because
her
ladyship
loved
mr
chaworth
better
so
in
order
to
remove
these
impediments
of
delicacy
i
have
to
make
three
propositions
namely
that
i
bring
you
into
parliament
the
next
election
for
my
own
borough
that
you
take
possession
of
the
lodge
the
day
you
marry
emmy
while
i
will
live
for
the
little
time
i
have
to
stay
here
in
the
large
cottage
built
by
my
uncle
and
that
i
give
you
your
legacy
of
ten
thousand
pounds
down
to
prevent
trouble
hereafter
as
i
know
nothing
but
delicacy
has
driven
you
away
from
us
i
make
no
doubt
you
will
now
find
all
objections
removed
and
that
peter
will
bring
back
the
joyful
intelligence
of
your
return
to
us
as
soon
as
the
business
you
left
us
on
is
completed
your
uncle
that
is
to
be
roderic
benfield
as
johnson
is
a
stranger
to
the
ways
of
the
town
i
wish
you
to
advise
his
inexperience
particularly
against
the
arts
of
designing
women
peter
being
a
man
of
considerable
estate
and
great
modesty
there
nephew
cried
benfield
as
the
baronet
finished
reading
the
letter
aloud
is
it
not
unreasonable
to
refuse
my
offers
now
read
his
answer
words
are
wanting
to
express
the
sensations
which
have
been
excited
by
benfield
letter
but
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
man
to
be
so
base
as
to
avail
himself
of
such
liberality
the
recollection
of
it
together
with
that
of
his
many
virtues
will
long
continue
deeply
impressed
on
the
heart
of
him
whom
benfield
would
if
within
the
power
of
man
render
the
happiest
amongst
human
beings
the
steward
listened
eagerly
to
this
answer
but
after
it
was
done
he
was
as
much
at
a
loss
to
know
its
contents
as
before
its
perusal
he
knew
it
was
unfavorable
to
their
wishes
but
could
not
comprehend
its
meaning
or
expressions
and
immediately
attributed
their
ambiguity
to
the
strange
conference
he
had
witnessed
between
denbigh
and
the
military
stranger
master
exclaimed
peter
with
something
of
the
elation
of
a
discoverer
i
know
the
cause
it
shows
itself
in
the
letter
there
was
a
man
talking
greek
to
him
while
he
was
reading
your
letter
greek
exclaimed
sir
edward
in
astonishment
greek
said
the
uncle
lord
gosford
read
greek
but
i
believe
never
conversed
in
that
language
yes
sir
edward
yes
your
honor
pure
wild
greek
it
must
have
been
something
of
that
kind
added
peter
with
positiveness
that
would
make
a
man
refuse
such
offers
miss
emmy
the
lodge
and
the
steward
shook
his
head
with
much
satisfaction
at
having
discovered
the
cause
sir
edward
smiled
at
the
simplicity
of
johnson
but
disliking
the
idea
attached
to
the
refusal
of
his
daughter
said
perhaps
after
all
uncle
there
has
been
some
misunderstanding
between
emily
and
denbigh
which
may
have
driven
him
from
us
so
suddenly
benfield
and
his
steward
exchanged
looks
and
a
new
idea
broke
upon
them
at
the
instant
they
had
both
suffered
in
that
way
and
after
all
it
might
prove
that
emily
was
the
one
whose
taste
or
feelings
had
subverted
their
schemes
the
impression
once
made
soon
became
strong
and
the
party
separated
the
master
thinking
alternately
on
lady
juliana
and
his
niece
while
the
man
after
heaving
one
heavy
sigh
to
the
memory
of
patty
steele
proceeded
to
the
usual
occupations
of
his
office
wilson
thinking
a
ride
would
be
of
service
to
emily
and
having
the
fullest
confidence
in
her
and
resignation
availed
herself
of
a
fine
day
to
pay
a
visit
to
their
friend
in
the
cottage
fitzgerald
received
them
in
her
usual
manner
but
a
single
glance
of
her
eye
sufficed
to
show
the
aunt
that
she
noticed
the
altered
appearance
of
emily
and
her
manners
although
without
knowing
its
true
reason
which
she
did
not
deem
it
prudent
to
explain
julia
handed
her
friend
a
note
which
she
said
she
had
received
the
day
before
and
desired
their
counsel
how
to
proceed
in
the
present
emergency
as
emily
was
to
be
made
acquainted
with
its
contents
her
aunt
read
it
aloud
as
follows
my
dear
niece
your
father
and
myself
had
been
induced
to
think
you
were
leading
a
disgraceful
life
with
the
officer
your
husband
had
consigned
you
to
the
care
of
for
hearing
of
your
captivity
i
had
arrived
with
a
band
of
guerillas
on
the
spot
where
you
were
rescued
early
the
next
morning
and
there
learnt
of
the
peasants
your
misfortunes
and
retreat
the
enemy
pressed
us
too
much
to
allow
us
to
deviate
from
our
route
at
the
time
but
natural
affection
and
the
wishes
of
your
father
have
led
me
to
make
a
journey
to
england
in
order
to
satisfy
our
doubts
as
regards
your
conduct
i
have
seen
you
heard
your
character
in
the
neighborhood
and
after
much
and
long
search
have
found
out
the
officer
and
am
satisfied
that
so
far
as
concerns
your
deportment
you
are
an
injured
woman
i
have
therefore
to
propose
to
you
on
my
own
behalf
and
that
of
the
conde
that
you
adopt
the
faith
of
your
country
and
return
with
me
to
the
arms
of
your
parent
whose
heiress
you
will
be
and
whose
life
you
may
be
the
means
of
prolonging
direct
your
answer
to
me
to
the
care
of
our
ambassador
and
as
you
decide
i
am
your
mother
brother
louis
y
harrison
on
what
point
do
you
wish
my
advice
said
wilson
kindly
after
she
had
finished
reading
the
letter
and
when
do
you
expect
to
see
your
uncle
would
you
have
me
accept
the
offer
of
my
father
dear
madam
or
am
i
to
remain
separated
from
him
for
the
short
residue
of
his
life
fitzgerald
was
affected
to
tears
as
she
asked
this
question
and
waited
her
answer
in
silent
dread
of
its
nature
is
the
condition
of
a
change
of
religion
an
immovable
one
inquired
wilson
in
a
thoughtful
manner
oh
doubtless
replied
julia
shuddering
but
i
am
deservedly
punished
for
my
early
disobedience
and
bow
in
submission
to
the
will
of
providence
i
feel
now
all
that
horror
of
a
change
of
my
religion
i
once
only
affected
i
must
live
and
die
a
protestant
madam
certainly
i
hope
so
my
dear
said
wilson
i
am
not
a
bigot
and
think
it
unfortunate
you
were
not
in
your
circumstances
bred
a
pious
catholic
it
would
have
saved
you
much
misery
and
might
have
rendered
the
close
of
your
father
life
more
happy
but
as
your
present
creed
embraces
doctrines
too
much
at
variance
with
the
romish
church
to
renounce
the
one
or
to
adopt
the
other
with
your
views
it
will
be
impossible
to
change
your
church
without
committing
a
heavy
offence
against
the
opinions
and
practices
of
every
denomination
of
christians
i
should
hope
a
proper
representation
of
this
to
your
uncle
would
have
its
weight
or
they
might
be
satisfied
with
your
being
a
christian
without
becoming
a
catholic
ah
my
dear
madam
answered
fitzgerald
despairingly
you
little
know
the
opinions
of
my
countrymen
on
this
subject
surely
surely
cried
wilson
parental
affection
is
a
stronger
feeling
than
bigotry
fitzgerald
shook
her
head
in
a
manner
which
bespoke
both
her
apprehensions
and
her
filial
regard
julia
ought
not
must
not
desert
her
father
dear
aunt
said
emily
her
face
glowing
with
the
ardency
of
her
feelings
and
ought
she
to
desert
her
heavenly
father
my
child
asked
the
aunt
mildly
are
the
duties
conflicting
dearest
aunt
the
conde
makes
them
so
julia
is
i
trust
in
sincerity
a
christian
and
with
what
face
can
she
offer
up
her
daily
petitions
to
her
creator
while
she
wears
a
mask
to
her
earthly
father
or
how
can
she
profess
to
honor
doctrines
that
she
herself
believes
to
be
false
or
practise
customs
she
thinks
improper
never
never
exclaimed
julia
with
fervor
the
struggle
is
dreadful
but
i
submit
to
the
greater
duty
and
you
decide
rightly
my
friend
said
wilson
soothingly
but
you
need
relax
no
efforts
to
convince
the
conde
of
your
wishes
truth
and
nature
will
finally
conquer
ah
cried
fitzgerald
the
sad
consequences
of
one
false
step
in
early
life
rather
added
wilson
the
sad
consequences
of
one
false
step
in
generations
gone
by
had
your
grandmother
listened
to
the
voice
of
prudence
and
duty
she
never
would
have
deserted
her
parents
for
a
comparative
stranger
and
entailed
upon
her
descendants
a
train
of
evils
which
yet
exist
in
your
person
it
will
be
a
sad
blow
to
my
poor
uncle
too
said
fitzgerald
he
who
once
loved
me
so
much
when
do
you
expect
to
see
him
inquired
emily
julia
informed
them
she
expected
him
hourly
as
fearful
a
written
statement
of
her
views
would
drive
him
from
the
country
without
paying
her
a
visit
before
he
departed
she
had
earnestly
entreated
him
to
see
her
without
delay
on
taking
their
leave
the
ladies
promised
to
obey
her
summons
whenever
called
to
meet
the
general
as
wilson
thought
she
might
be
better
able
to
give
advice
to
a
friend
by
knowing
more
of
the
character
of
her
relatives
than
she
could
do
with
her
present
information
one
day
intervened
and
it
was
spent
in
the
united
society
of
lady
moseley
and
her
daughters
while
sir
edward
and
francis
rode
to
a
neighboring
town
on
business
and
on
the
succeeding
fitzgerald
apprised
them
of
the
arrival
of
general
immediately
after
breakfast
wilson
and
emily
drove
to
the
cottage
the
aunt
both
wishing
the
latter
as
a
companion
in
her
ride
and
believing
the
excitement
would
have
a
tendency
to
prevent
her
niece
from
indulging
in
reflections
alike
dangerous
to
her
peace
of
mind
and
at
variance
with
her
duties
our
readers
have
probably
anticipated
that
the
stage
companion
of
john
moseley
was
the
spanish
general
who
had
just
been
making
those
inquiries
into
the
manner
of
his
niece
living
which
terminated
so
happily
in
her
acquittal
with
that
part
of
her
history
which
relates
to
the
injurious
attempts
on
her
before
she
arrived
at
lisbon
he
appears
to
have
been
ignorant
or
his
interview
with
denbigh
might
have
terminated
very
differently
from
the
manner
already
related
a
description
of
the
appearance
of
the
gentleman
presented
to
wilson
is
unnecessary
as
it
has
been
given
already
and
the
discerning
matron
thought
she
read
through
the
rigid
and
set
features
of
the
soldier
a
shade
of
kinder
feelings
which
might
be
wrought
into
an
advantageous
intercession
on
behalf
of
julia
the
general
was
evidently
endeavoring
to
keep
his
feelings
within
due
bounds
before
the
decision
of
his
niece
might
render
it
proper
for
him
to
indulge
in
that
affection
for
her
which
his
eye
plainly
showed
existed
under
the
cover
of
his
assumed
manner
it
was
an
effort
of
great
fortitude
on
the
part
of
julia
to
acquaint
her
uncle
with
her
resolution
but
as
it
must
be
done
she
seized
a
moment
after
wilson
had
at
some
length
defended
her
adhering
to
her
present
faith
until
religiously
impressed
with
its
errors
to
inform
him
such
was
her
unalterable
resolution
he
heard
her
patiently
and
without
anger
but
in
visible
surprise
he
had
construed
her
summons
to
her
house
into
a
measure
preparatory
to
accepting
his
conditions
yet
he
betrayed
no
emotion
after
the
first
expression
of
his
wonder
he
told
her
distinctly
a
renunciation
of
her
heresy
was
the
only
condition
on
which
her
father
would
own
her
either
as
his
heiress
or
his
child
julia
deeply
regretted
the
decision
but
was
firm
and
her
friends
left
her
to
enjoy
uninterruptedly
for
one
day
the
society
of
so
near
a
relative
during
this
day
every
doubt
as
to
the
propriety
of
her
conduct
if
any
yet
remained
was
removed
by
a
relation
of
her
little
story
to
her
uncle
and
after
it
was
completed
he
expressed
great
uneasiness
to
get
to
london
again
in
order
to
meet
a
gentleman
he
had
seen
there
under
a
different
impression
as
to
his
merits
than
what
now
appeared
to
be
just
who
the
gentleman
was
or
what
these
impressions
were
julia
was
left
to
conjecture
taciturnity
being
a
favorite
property
in
the
general
chapter
xxxi
the
sun
had
just
risen
on
one
of
the
loveliest
vales
of
caernarvonshire
as
a
travelling
chaise
and
six
swept
up
to
the
door
of
a
princely
mansion
so
situated
as
to
command
a
prospect
of
the
fertile
and
extensive
domains
the
rental
of
which
filled
the
coffers
of
its
rich
owner
having
a
beautiful
view
of
the
irish
channel
in
the
distance
everything
around
this
stately
edifice
bespoke
the
magnificence
of
its
ancient
possessors
and
the
taste
of
its
present
master
it
was
irregular
but
built
of
the
best
materials
and
in
the
tastes
of
the
different
ages
in
which
its
various
parts
had
been
erected
and
now
in
the
nineteenth
century
it
preserved
the
baronial
grandeur
of
the
thirteenth
mingled
with
the
comforts
of
this
later
period
the
lofty
turrets
of
its
towers
were
tipt
with
the
golden
light
of
the
sun
and
the
neighboring
peasantry
had
commenced
their
daily
labors
as
the
different
attendants
of
the
equipage
we
have
mentioned
collected
around
it
at
the
great
entrance
to
the
building
the
beautiful
black
horses
with
coats
as
shining
as
the
polished
leather
with
which
they
were
caparisoned
the
elegant
and
fashionable
finish
of
the
vehicle
with
its
numerous
grooms
postillions
and
footmen
all
wearing
the
livery
of
one
master
gave
evidence
of
wealth
and
rank
in
attendance
there
were
four
outriders
walking
leisurely
about
awaiting
the
appearance
of
those
for
whose
comforts
and
pleasures
they
were
kept
to
contribute
while
a
fifth
who
like
the
others
was
equipped
with
a
horse
appeared
to
bear
a
doubtful
station
the
form
of
the
latter
was
athletic
and
apparently
drilled
into
a
severer
submission
than
could
be
seen
in
the
movements
of
the
liveried
attendants
his
dress
was
peculiar
being
neither
quite
menial
nor
quite
military
but
partaking
of
both
characters
his
horse
was
heavier
and
better
managed
than
those
of
the
others
and
by
its
side
was
a
charger
that
was
prepared
for
the
use
of
no
common
equestrian
both
were
black
as
were
all
the
others
of
the
cavalcade
but
the
pistols
of
the
two
latter
and
housings
of
their
saddles
bore
the
aspect
of
use
and
elegance
united
the
postillions
were
mounted
listlessly
waiting
the
pleasure
of
their
superiors
when
the
laughs
and
jokes
of
the
menials
were
instantly
succeeded
by
a
respectful
and
profound
silence
as
a
gentleman
and
lady
appeared
on
the
portico
of
the
building
the
former
was
a
young
man
of
commanding
stature
and
genteel
appearance
and
his
air
although
that
of
one
used
to
command
was
softened
by
a
character
of
benevolence
and
gentleness
that
might
be
rightly
supposed
to
give
birth
to
the
willing
alacrity
with
which
all
his
requests
or
orders
were
attended
to
the
lady
was
also
young
and
resembled
her
companion
both
in
features
and
expression
for
both
were
noble
both
were
handsome
the
former
was
attired
for
the
road
the
latter
had
thrown
a
shawl
around
her
elegant
form
and
by
her
morning
dress
showed
that
a
separation
of
the
two
was
about
to
happen
taking
the
hand
of
the
gentleman
with
both
her
own
as
she
pressed
it
with
fingers
interlocked
the
lady
said
in
a
voice
of
music
and
with
great
affection
then
my
dear
brother
i
shall
certainly
hear
from
you
within
the
week
and
see
you
next
certainly
replied
the
gentleman
as
he
tenderly
paid
his
adieus
then
throwing
himself
into
the
chaise
it
dashed
from
the
door
like
the
passage
of
a
meteor
the
horsemen
followed
the
unridden
charger
obedient
to
the
orders
of
his
keeper
wheeled
gracefully
into
his
station
and
in
an
instant
they
were
all
lost
amidst
the
wood
through
which
the
road
to
the
park
gates
conducted
after
lingering
without
until
the
last
of
her
brother
followers
had
receded
from
her
sight
the
lady
retired
through
ranks
of
liveried
footmen
and
maids
whom
curiosity
or
respect
had
collected
the
young
traveller
wore
a
gloom
on
his
expressive
features
amidst
the
pageantry
that
surrounded
him
which
showed
the
insufficiency
of
wealth
and
honors
to
fill
the
sum
of
human
happiness
as
his
carriage
rolled
proudly
up
an
eminence
ere
he
had
reached
the
confines
of
his
extensive
park
his
eye
rested
for
a
moment
on
a
scene
in
which
meadows
forests
fields
waving
with
golden
corn
comfortable
surrounded
with
innumerable
cottages
were
seen
in
almost
endless
variety
all
these
owned
him
for
their
lord
and
one
quiet
smile
of
satisfaction
beamed
on
his
face
as
he
gazed
on
the
unlimited
view
could
the
heart
of
that
youth
have
been
read
it
would
at
that
moment
have
told
a
story
very
different
from
the
feelings
such
a
scene
is
apt
to
excite
it
would
have
spoken
the
consciousness
of
well
applied
wealth
the
gratification
of
contemplating
meritorious
deeds
and
a
heartfelt
gratitude
to
the
being
which
had
enabled
him
to
become
the
dispenser
of
happiness
to
so
many
of
his
which
way
my
lord
so
early
cried
a
gentleman
in
a
phaeton
as
he
drew
up
on
his
way
to
a
watering
place
to
pay
his
own
parting
compliments
to
eltringham
sir
owen
to
attend
the
marriage
of
my
kinsman
denbigh
to
one
of
the
sisters
of
the
marquess
a
few
more
questions
and
answers
and
the
gentlemen
exchanging
friendly
adieus
pursued
each
his
own
course
sir
owen
ap
rice
pushing
forward
for
cheltenham
and
the
earl
of
pendennyss
proceeding
to
act
as
groomsman
to
his
cousin
the
gates
of
eltringham
were
open
to
the
admission
of
many
an
equipage
on
the
following
day
and
the
heart
of
the
lady
laura
beat
quick
as
the
sound
of
wheels
at
different
times
reached
her
ears
at
last
an
unusual
movement
in
the
house
drew
her
to
a
window
of
her
and
the
blood
rushed
to
her
heart
as
she
beheld
the
equipages
which
were
rapidly
approaching
and
through
the
mist
which
stole
over
her
eyes
she
saw
alight
from
the
first
the
duke
of
derwent
and
the
bridegroom
the
next
contained
lord
pendennyss
and
the
last
the
bishop
of
lady
laura
waited
to
see
no
more
but
with
a
heart
filled
with
terror
hope
joy
and
uneasiness
she
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
one
of
her
sisters
ah
exclaimed
lord
henry
stapleton
about
a
week
after
the
wedding
of
his
sister
seizing
john
suddenly
by
the
arm
while
the
latter
was
taking
his
morning
walk
to
the
residence
of
the
dowager
lady
chatterton
moseley
you
dissipated
youth
in
town
yet
you
told
me
you
should
stay
but
a
day
and
here
i
find
you
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
john
blushed
a
little
at
the
consciousness
of
his
reason
for
sending
a
written
instead
of
carrying
a
verbal
report
of
the
result
of
his
journey
but
replied
yes
my
friend
chatterton
unexpectedly
arrived
and
so
and
so
and
so
you
did
not
go
i
presume
you
mean
cried
lord
henry
with
a
laugh
yes
said
john
and
so
i
stayed
but
where
is
denbigh
where
why
with
his
wife
where
every
man
should
be
especially
for
the
first
month
rejoined
the
sailor
gaily
wife
echoed
john
as
soon
as
he
felt
able
to
give
utterance
to
his
words
wife
is
he
married
married
cried
lord
henry
imitating
his
manner
are
you
yet
to
learn
that
why
did
you
ask
for
him
ask
for
him
said
moseley
yet
lost
in
astonishment
but
when
how
where
did
he
marry
my
lord
lord
henry
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
with
a
surprise
little
short
of
his
own
as
he
answered
more
gravely
when
last
tuesday
how
by
special
license
and
the
bishop
of
where
at
eltringham
yes
my
dear
fellow
continued
he
with
his
former
gaiety
george
is
my
brother
now
and
a
fine
fellow
he
is
i
really
wish
your
lordship
much
joy
said
john
struggling
to
command
his
feelings
thank
you
thank
you
replied
the
sailor
a
jolly
time
we
had
of
it
moseley
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
you
had
been
there
no
bolting
or
running
away
as
soon
as
spliced
but
a
regularly
constructed
fashioned
wedding
all
my
doings
i
wrote
laura
that
time
was
scarce
and
i
had
none
to
throw
away
on
fooleries
so
dear
good
soul
she
consented
to
let
me
have
everything
my
own
way
we
had
derwent
and
pendennyss
the
marquess
lord
william
and
myself
for
groomsmen
and
my
three
sisters
ah
that
was
bad
but
there
was
no
helping
it
lady
harriet
denbigh
and
an
old
maid
a
cousin
of
ours
for
bridesmaids
could
not
help
the
old
maid
either
upon
my
honor
or
be
quite
certain
i
would
how
much
of
what
he
said
moseley
heard
we
can
not
say
for
had
he
talked
an
hour
longer
he
would
have
been
uninterrupted
lord
henry
was
too
much
engaged
with
his
description
to
notice
his
companion
taciturnity
or
surprise
and
after
walking
a
square
or
two
together
they
parted
the
sailor
being
on
the
wing
for
his
frigate
at
yarmouth
john
continued
his
course
musing
on
the
intelligence
he
had
just
heard
that
denbigh
could
forget
emily
so
soon
he
would
not
believe
and
he
greatly
feared
he
had
been
driven
into
a
step
from
despair
that
he
might
hereafter
repent
of
the
avoiding
of
himself
was
now
fully
explained
but
would
lady
laura
stapleton
accept
a
man
for
a
husband
at
so
short
a
notice
and
for
the
first
time
a
suspicion
that
something
in
the
character
of
denbigh
was
wrong
mingled
in
his
reflections
on
his
sister
refusal
of
his
offers
lord
and
lady
herriefield
were
on
the
eve
of
their
departure
for
the
continent
for
catherine
had
been
led
to
the
altar
the
preceding
week
a
southern
climate
having
been
prescribed
as
necessary
to
the
bridegroom
constitution
and
the
dowager
and
grace
were
about
to
proceed
to
a
seat
of
the
baron
within
a
couple
of
miles
of
bath
chatterton
himself
had
his
own
engagements
but
he
promised
to
be
there
in
company
with
his
friend
derwent
within
a
fortnight
the
former
visit
having
been
postponed
by
the
marriages
in
their
respective
families
john
had
been
assiduous
in
his
attentions
during
the
season
of
forced
gaiety
which
followed
the
nuptials
of
kate
and
as
the
dowager
time
was
monopolized
with
the
ceremonials
of
that
event
grace
had
risen
greatly
in
his
estimation
if
grace
chatterton
was
not
more
miserable
than
usual
at
what
she
thought
was
the
destruction
of
her
happiness
it
was
owing
to
the
presence
and
unconcealed
affection
of
john
moseley
the
carriage
of
lord
herriefield
was
in
waiting
when
john
rang
for
admittance
on
opening
the
door
and
entering
the
he
saw
the
bride
and
bridegroom
with
their
mother
and
sister
accoutred
for
an
excursion
amongst
the
shops
of
bond
street
for
kate
was
dying
to
find
a
vent
for
some
of
her
surplus
her
husband
to
show
his
handsome
wife
in
the
face
of
the
world
the
mother
to
display
the
triumph
of
her
matrimonial
schemes
and
grace
was
forced
to
obey
her
mother
commands
in
accompanying
her
sister
as
an
attendant
not
to
be
dispensed
with
at
all
in
her
circumstances
the
entrance
of
john
at
that
instant
though
nothing
more
than
what
occurred
every
day
at
that
hour
deranged
the
whole
plan
the
dowager
for
a
moment
forgot
her
resolution
and
forgot
the
necessity
of
appearance
exclaiming
with
evident
satisfaction
here
is
moseley
come
to
keep
you
company
grace
so
after
all
you
must
consult
your
headache
and
stay
at
home
indeed
my
love
i
never
can
consent
you
should
go
out
i
not
only
wish
but
insist
you
remain
within
this
morning
lord
herriefield
looked
at
his
in
some
surprise
and
threw
a
suspicious
glance
on
his
own
rib
at
the
moment
which
spoke
as
plainly
as
looks
can
speak
is
it
possible
i
have
been
taken
in
after
all
grace
was
unused
to
resist
her
mother
commands
and
throwing
off
her
hat
and
shawl
reseated
herself
with
more
composure
than
she
would
probably
have
done
had
not
the
attentions
of
moseley
been
more
delicate
and
pointed
of
late
than
formerly
as
they
passed
the
porter
lady
chatterton
observed
to
him
significantly
nobody
at
home
willis
yes
my
lady
was
the
laconic
reply
and
lord
herriefield
as
he
took
his
seat
by
the
side
of
his
wife
in
the
carriage
thought
she
was
not
as
handsome
as
usual
lady
chatterton
that
morning
unguardedly
laid
the
foundation
of
years
of
misery
for
her
eldest
daughter
or
rather
the
foundations
were
already
laid
in
the
and
heartless
unprincipled
union
she
had
labored
with
success
to
effect
but
she
had
that
morning
stripped
the
mask
from
her
own
character
prematurely
and
excited
suspicions
in
the
breast
of
her
which
time
only
served
to
confirm
and
memory
to
brood
over
lord
herriefield
had
been
too
long
in
the
world
not
to
understand
all
the
ordinary
arts
of
and
like
most
of
his
own
sex
who
have
associated
freely
with
the
worst
part
of
the
other
his
opinions
of
female
excellences
were
by
no
means
extravagant
or
romantic
kate
had
pleased
his
eye
she
was
of
a
noble
family
young
and
at
that
moment
interestingly
quiet
having
nothing
particularly
in
view
she
had
a
taste
of
her
own
and
lord
herriefield
was
by
no
means
in
conformity
with
it
consequently
she
expended
none
of
those
pretty
little
arts
upon
him
which
she
occasionally
practised
and
which
his
experience
would
immediately
have
detected
her
disgust
he
had
attributed
to
disinterestedness
and
as
kate
had
fixed
her
eye
on
a
young
officer
lately
returned
from
france
and
her
mother
on
a
duke
who
was
mourning
the
death
of
a
third
wife
devising
means
to
console
him
with
a
fourth
the
viscount
had
got
a
good
deal
enamored
with
the
lady
before
either
she
or
her
mother
took
any
particular
notice
that
there
was
such
a
being
in
existence
his
title
was
not
the
most
elevated
but
it
was
ancient
his
paternal
acres
were
not
numerous
but
his
shares
were
he
was
not
very
young
but
he
was
not
very
old
and
as
the
duke
died
of
a
fit
of
the
gout
in
his
stomach
and
the
officer
ran
away
with
a
girl
in
her
teens
from
a
the
dowager
and
her
daughter
after
thoroughly
scanning
the
fashionable
world
determined
for
want
of
a
better
that
he
would
do
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
mother
and
child
held
any
open
communications
with
each
other
to
this
effect
the
delicacy
and
pride
of
both
would
have
been
greatly
injured
by
such
a
suspicion
yet
they
arrived
simultaneously
at
the
same
conclusion
as
well
as
at
another
of
equal
importance
to
the
completion
of
their
schemes
on
the
viscount
it
was
simply
to
adhere
to
the
same
conduct
which
had
made
him
a
captive
as
most
likely
to
insure
the
victory
there
was
such
a
general
understanding
between
the
two
it
can
excite
no
surprise
that
they
harmoniously
as
it
were
by
signal
for
two
people
correctly
impressed
with
their
duties
and
responsibilities
to
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion
in
the
government
of
their
conduct
would
be
merely
a
matter
of
course
and
so
with
those
who
are
more
or
less
under
the
dominion
of
the
world
they
will
pursue
their
plans
with
a
degree
of
concurrence
amounting
nearly
to
sympathy
and
thus
had
kate
and
her
mother
until
this
morning
kept
up
the
masquerade
so
well
that
the
viscount
was
as
confiding
as
a
country
corydon
when
he
first
witnessed
the
dowager
management
with
grace
and
john
however
and
his
wife
careless
disregard
of
a
thing
which
appeared
too
much
a
matter
of
course
to
be
quite
agreeable
his
newly
awakened
distrust
approached
conviction
grace
chatterton
both
sang
and
played
exquisitely
it
was
however
seldom
she
could
sufficiently
overcome
her
desire
when
john
was
an
auditor
to
appear
to
advantage
as
the
party
went
down
stairs
and
moseley
had
gone
with
them
part
of
the
way
she
threw
herself
unconsciously
in
a
seat
and
began
a
beautiful
song
that
was
fashionable
at
the
time
her
feelings
were
in
consonance
with
the
words
and
grace
was
very
happy
both
in
execution
and
voice
john
had
reached
the
back
of
her
seat
before
she
was
at
all
sensible
of
his
return
and
grace
lost
her
immediately
she
rose
and
took
a
seat
on
a
sofa
and
the
young
man
was
immediately
at
her
side
ah
grace
said
john
the
lady
heart
beating
high
you
certainly
do
sing
as
you
do
everything
admirably
i
am
happy
you
think
so
moseley
returned
grace
looking
everywhere
but
in
his
face
john
eyes
ran
over
her
beauties
as
with
palpitating
bosom
and
varying
color
she
sat
confused
at
the
unusual
warmth
of
his
language
and
manner
fortunately
a
remarkably
striking
likeness
of
the
dowager
hung
directly
over
their
heads
and
john
taking
her
unresisting
hand
continued
dear
grace
you
resemble
your
brother
very
much
in
features
and
what
is
better
still
in
character
i
could
wish
said
grace
venturing
to
look
up
to
resemble
your
sister
emily
in
the
latter
and
why
not
to
be
her
sister
dear
grace
said
he
with
ardor
you
are
worthy
to
become
her
sister
tell
me
grace
dear
miss
chatterton
can
you
will
you
make
me
the
happiest
of
men
may
i
present
another
inestimable
daughter
to
my
parents
as
john
paused
for
an
answer
grace
looked
up
and
he
waited
her
reply
in
evident
anxiety
but
she
continued
silent
now
pale
as
death
and
now
of
the
color
of
the
rose
and
he
added
i
hope
i
have
not
offended
you
dearest
grace
you
are
all
that
is
desirable
to
me
my
hopes
my
happiness
are
centred
in
you
unless
you
consent
to
become
my
wife
i
must
be
very
wretched
grace
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
as
her
lover
interested
deeply
in
their
cause
gently
drew
her
towards
him
her
head
sank
on
his
shoulder
as
she
faintly
whispered
something
that
was
inaudible
but
which
he
did
not
fail
to
interpret
into
everything
he
most
wished
to
hear
john
was
in
ecstasies
every
unpleasant
feeling
of
suspicion
had
left
him
of
grace
innocence
of
manoeuvring
he
never
doubted
but
john
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
being
entrapped
into
anything
even
a
step
which
he
desired
an
uninterrupted
communication
followed
it
was
as
confiding
as
their
affections
and
the
return
of
the
dowager
and
her
children
first
recalled
them
to
the
recollection
of
other
people
one
glance
of
the
eye
was
enough
for
lady
chatterton
she
saw
the
traces
of
tears
on
the
cheeks
and
in
the
eyes
of
grace
and
the
dowager
was
satisfied
she
knew
his
friends
would
not
object
and
as
grace
attended
her
to
her
she
cried
on
entering
it
well
child
when
is
the
wedding
to
be
you
will
wear
me
out
with
so
much
gaiety
grace
was
shocked
but
did
not
as
formerly
weep
over
her
interference
in
agony
and
dread
john
had
opened
his
whole
soul
to
her
observing
the
greatest
delicacy
towards
her
mother
and
she
now
felt
her
happiness
placed
in
the
keeping
of
a
man
whose
honor
she
believed
much
exceeded
that
of
any
other
human
being
chapter
xxxii
the
seniors
of
the
party
at
benfield
lodge
were
all
assembled
one
morning
in
a
parlor
when
its
master
and
the
baronet
were
occupied
in
the
perusal
of
the
london
papers
clara
had
persuaded
her
sisters
to
accompany
her
and
francis
in
an
excursion
as
far
as
the
village
jane
yet
continued
reserved
and
distant
to
most
of
her
friends
while
emily
conduct
would
have
escaped
unnoticed
did
not
her
blanched
cheek
and
wandering
looks
at
times
speak
a
language
not
to
be
misunderstood
with
all
her
relatives
she
maintained
the
affectionate
intercourse
she
had
always
supported
though
not
even
to
her
aunt
did
the
name
of
denbigh
pass
her
lips
but
in
her
most
private
and
humble
petitions
to
god
she
never
forgot
to
mingle
with
her
requests
for
spiritual
blessings
on
herself
fervent
prayers
for
the
conversion
of
the
preserver
of
her
life
wilson
as
she
sat
by
the
side
of
her
sister
at
their
needles
first
discovered
an
unusual
uneasiness
in
their
venerable
host
while
he
turned
his
paper
over
and
over
as
if
unwilling
or
unable
to
comprehend
some
part
of
its
contents
until
he
rang
the
bell
violently
and
bid
the
servant
to
send
johnson
to
him
without
a
moment
delay
peter
said
benfield
doubtingly
read
that
your
eyes
are
young
peter
read
that
peter
took
the
paper
and
after
having
adjusted
his
spectacles
to
his
satisfaction
he
proceeded
to
obey
his
master
injunctions
but
the
same
defect
of
vision
as
suddenly
seized
the
steward
as
it
had
affected
his
master
he
turned
the
paper
sideways
and
appeared
to
be
spelling
the
matter
of
the
paragraph
to
himself
peter
would
have
given
his
three
hundred
a
year
to
have
had
the
impatient
john
moseley
at
hand
to
relieve
him
from
his
task
but
the
anxiety
of
benfield
overcoming
his
fear
of
the
worst
he
inquired
in
tremulous
tone
peter
hem
peter
what
do
you
think
why
your
honor
replied
the
steward
stealing
a
look
at
his
master
it
does
seem
so
indeed
i
remember
said
the
master
when
lord
gosford
saw
the
marriage
of
the
countess
announced
he
here
the
old
gentleman
was
obliged
to
stop
and
rising
with
dignity
and
leaning
on
the
arm
of
his
faithful
servant
he
left
the
room
wilson
immediately
took
up
the
paper
and
her
eye
catching
the
paragraph
at
a
glance
she
read
aloud
as
follows
to
her
expecting
friends
married
by
special
license
at
the
seat
of
the
most
noble
the
marquess
of
eltringham
in
devonshire
by
the
right
rev
lord
bishop
of
george
denbigh
lieutenant
colonel
of
his
majesty
regiment
of
dragoons
to
the
right
honorable
lady
laura
stapleton
eldest
sister
of
the
marquess
eltringham
was
honored
on
the
present
happy
occasion
with
the
presence
of
his
grace
of
derwent
and
the
gallant
lord
pendennyss
kinsmen
of
the
bridegroom
and
captain
lord
henry
stapleton
of
the
royal
navy
we
understand
that
the
happy
couple
proceed
to
denbigh
castle
immediately
after
the
although
wilson
had
given
up
the
expectation
of
ever
seeing
her
niece
the
wife
of
denbigh
she
felt
an
indescribable
shock
as
she
read
this
paragraph
the
strongest
feeling
was
horror
at
the
danger
emily
had
been
in
of
contracting
an
alliance
with
such
a
man
his
avoiding
the
ball
at
which
he
knew
lord
henry
was
expected
was
explained
to
her
by
this
marriage
for
with
john
she
could
not
believe
a
woman
like
lady
laura
stapleton
was
to
be
won
in
the
short
space
of
one
fortnight
or
indeed
less
there
was
too
evidently
a
mystery
yet
to
be
developed
and
she
felt
certain
one
that
would
not
elevate
his
character
in
her
opinion
neither
sir
edward
nor
lady
moseley
had
given
up
the
expectation
of
seeing
denbigh
again
as
a
suitor
for
emily
hand
and
to
both
of
them
this
certainty
of
his
loss
was
a
heavy
blow
the
baronet
took
up
the
paper
and
after
perusing
the
article
he
muttered
in
a
low
tone
as
he
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
heaven
bless
him
i
sincerely
hope
she
is
worthy
of
him
worthy
of
him
thought
wilson
with
a
feeling
of
indignation
as
taking
up
the
paper
she
retired
to
her
own
room
whither
emily
at
that
moment
returned
from
her
walk
had
proceeded
as
her
niece
must
hear
this
news
she
thought
the
sooner
the
better
the
exercise
and
the
unreserved
conversation
of
francis
and
clara
had
restored
in
some
degree
the
bloom
to
the
cheek
of
emily
and
wilson
felt
it
necessary
to
struggle
with
herself
before
she
could
summon
sufficient
resolution
to
invade
the
returning
peace
of
her
charge
however
having
already
decided
on
her
course
she
proceeded
to
the
discharge
of
what
she
thought
to
be
a
duty
emily
my
child
she
whispered
pressing
her
affectionately
to
her
bosom
you
have
been
all
i
could
wish
and
more
than
i
expected
under
your
arduous
struggles
but
one
more
pang
and
i
trust
your
recollections
on
this
painful
subject
will
be
done
away
emily
looked
at
her
aunt
in
anxious
expectation
of
what
was
coming
and
quietly
taking
the
paper
followed
the
direction
of
wilson
finger
to
the
article
on
the
marriage
of
denbigh
there
was
a
momentary
struggle
in
emily
for
she
was
obliged
to
find
support
in
a
chair
the
returning
richness
of
color
excited
by
her
walk
vanished
but
recovering
herself
she
pressed
the
hand
of
her
anxious
guardian
and
gently
waving
her
back
proceeded
to
her
own
room
on
her
return
to
the
company
the
same
control
of
her
feelings
which
had
distinguished
her
conduct
of
late
was
again
visible
and
although
her
aunt
most
narrowly
watched
her
movements
looks
and
speeches
she
could
discern
no
visible
alteration
by
this
confirmation
of
misconduct
the
truth
was
that
in
emily
moseley
the
obligations
of
duty
were
so
imperative
her
sense
of
her
dependence
on
providence
so
humbling
and
yet
so
confiding
that
as
soon
as
she
was
taught
to
believe
her
lover
unworthy
of
her
esteem
that
moment
an
insuperable
barrier
separated
them
his
marriage
could
add
nothing
to
the
distance
between
them
it
was
impossible
they
could
be
united
and
although
a
secret
lingering
of
the
affections
over
his
fallen
character
might
and
did
exist
it
existed
without
any
romantic
expectations
of
miracles
in
his
favor
or
vain
wishes
of
reformation
in
which
self
was
the
prominent
feeling
she
might
be
said
to
be
keenly
alive
to
all
that
concerned
his
welfare
or
movements
if
she
did
not
harbor
the
passion
of
love
but
it
showed
itself
in
prayers
for
his
amendment
of
life
and
the
most
ardent
petitions
for
his
future
and
eternal
happiness
she
had
set
about
seriously
and
with
much
energy
the
task
of
erasing
from
her
heart
sentiments
which
however
delightful
she
had
found
it
to
entertain
in
times
past
were
now
in
direct
variance
with
her
duty
she
knew
that
a
weak
indulgence
of
such
passions
would
tend
to
draw
her
mind
from
and
disqualify
her
to
discharge
those
various
calls
on
her
time
and
her
exertions
which
could
alone
enable
her
to
assist
others
or
effect
in
her
own
person
the
great
purposes
of
her
creation
it
was
never
lost
sight
of
by
emily
moseley
that
her
existence
here
was
preparatory
to
an
immensely
more
important
state
hereafter
she
was
consequently
in
charity
with
all
mankind
and
if
grown
a
little
more
distrustful
of
the
intentions
of
her
it
was
a
mistrust
bottomed
in
a
clear
view
of
the
frailties
of
our
nature
and
was
amongst
the
not
unfrequent
speculations
she
made
on
this
hasty
marriage
of
her
former
lover
wilson
saw
all
this
and
was
soon
made
acquainted
by
her
niece
in
terms
with
her
views
of
her
own
condition
and
although
she
had
to
and
did
deeply
regret
that
all
her
caution
had
not
been
able
to
guard
against
deception
where
it
was
most
important
for
her
to
guide
aright
yet
she
was
cheered
with
the
reflection
that
her
previous
care
with
the
blessings
of
providence
had
admirably
fitted
her
charge
to
combat
and
overcome
the
consequences
of
their
mistaken
confidence
the
gloom
which
this
little
paragraph
excited
extended
to
every
individual
in
the
family
for
all
had
placed
denbigh
by
the
side
of
john
in
their
affections
ever
since
his
weighty
services
to
emily
a
letter
from
john
announcing
his
intention
of
meeting
them
at
bath
as
well
as
his
new
relation
with
grace
relieved
in
some
measure
this
general
depression
of
spirit
benfield
alone
found
no
consolation
in
the
approaching
nuptials
john
he
regarded
as
his
nephew
and
grace
he
thought
a
very
good
sort
of
young
woman
but
neither
of
them
were
beings
of
the
same
genus
with
emily
and
denbigh
peter
said
he
one
day
after
they
had
both
been
expending
their
ingenuity
in
vain
efforts
to
discover
the
cause
of
this
marriage
being
so
unexpectedly
frustrated
have
i
not
often
told
you
that
fate
governed
these
things
in
order
that
men
might
be
humble
in
this
life
now
peter
had
the
lady
juliana
wedded
with
a
mind
congenial
to
her
own
she
might
have
been
mistress
of
benfield
lodge
to
this
very
hour
yes
your
honor
but
there
miss
emmy
legacy
and
peter
withdrew
thinking
what
would
have
been
the
consequences
had
patty
steele
been
more
willing
when
he
wished
to
make
her
peter
johnson
an
association
by
no
means
uncommon
in
the
mind
of
the
steward
for
if
patty
had
ever
a
rival
in
his
affections
it
was
in
the
person
of
emily
moseley
though
indeed
with
very
different
degrees
and
coloring
of
esteem
the
excursions
to
the
cottage
had
been
continued
by
wilson
and
emily
and
as
no
gentleman
was
now
in
the
family
to
interfere
with
their
communications
a
general
visit
to
the
young
widow
had
been
made
by
the
moseleys
including
sir
edward
and
ives
the
jarvises
had
gone
to
london
to
receive
their
children
now
penitent
in
more
senses
than
one
and
sir
edward
learnt
with
pleasure
that
egerton
and
his
wife
had
been
admitted
into
the
family
of
the
merchant
sir
edgar
had
died
suddenly
and
the
entailed
estates
had
fallen
to
his
successor
the
colonel
now
sir
harry
but
the
bulk
of
his
wealth
being
in
convertible
property
he
had
given
by
will
to
his
other
nephew
a
young
clergyman
and
a
son
of
a
younger
brother
mary
as
well
as
her
mother
were
greatly
disappointed
by
this
deprivation
of
what
they
considered
their
lawful
splendor
but
they
found
great
consolation
in
the
new
dignity
of
lady
egerton
whose
greatest
wish
now
was
to
meet
the
moseleys
in
order
that
she
might
precede
them
in
or
out
of
some
place
where
such
ceremonials
are
observed
the
sound
of
lady
carriage
stops
the
way
was
delightful
and
it
never
failed
to
be
used
on
all
occasions
although
her
ladyship
was
mistress
of
only
a
hired
vehicle
a
slight
insight
into
the
situation
of
things
amongst
them
may
be
found
in
the
following
narrative
of
their
views
as
revealed
in
a
discussion
which
took
place
about
a
fortnight
after
the
reunion
of
the
family
under
one
roof
jarvis
was
mistress
of
a
very
handsome
coach
the
gift
of
her
husband
for
her
own
private
use
after
having
satisfied
herself
the
baronet
a
dignity
he
had
enjoyed
just
hours
did
not
possess
the
ability
to
furnish
his
lady
as
she
termed
her
daughter
with
such
a
luxury
she
magnanimously
determined
to
relinquish
her
own
in
support
of
the
elevation
of
her
daughter
accordingly
a
consultation
on
the
alterations
which
were
necessary
took
place
between
the
ladies
the
arms
must
be
altered
of
course
lady
egerton
observed
and
sir
harry
with
the
bloody
hand
and
six
quarterings
put
in
their
place
then
the
liveries
they
must
be
changed
oh
mercy
my
lady
if
the
arms
are
altered
jarvis
will
be
sure
to
notice
it
and
he
would
never
forgive
me
and
perhaps
perhaps
what
exclaimed
the
lady
with
a
disdainful
toss
of
her
head
why
replied
the
mother
warmly
not
give
me
the
hundred
pounds
he
promised
to
have
it
and
painted
fiddlesticks
with
the
painting
jarvis
cried
the
lady
with
dignity
no
carriage
shall
be
called
mine
that
does
not
bear
my
arms
and
the
bloody
hand
why
your
ladyship
is
unreasonable
indeed
you
are
said
jarvis
coaxingly
and
then
after
a
moment
thought
she
continued
is
it
the
arms
or
the
baronetcy
you
want
my
dear
oh
i
care
nothing
for
the
arms
but
i
am
determined
now
i
am
a
baronet
lady
jarvis
to
have
the
proper
emblem
of
my
rank
certainly
my
lady
that
true
dignity
well
then
we
will
put
the
bloody
hand
on
your
father
arms
and
he
will
never
notice
it
for
he
never
sees
such
things
the
arrangement
was
happily
completed
and
for
a
few
days
the
coach
of
jarvis
bore
about
the
titled
dame
until
one
unlucky
day
the
merchant
who
still
went
on
when
any
great
bargain
in
the
stocks
was
to
be
made
arrived
at
his
own
door
suddenly
to
procure
a
calculation
he
had
made
on
the
leaf
of
his
the
last
sunday
during
sermon
this
he
obtained
after
some
search
in
his
haste
he
drove
to
his
broker
in
the
carriage
of
his
wife
to
save
time
it
happening
to
be
in
waiting
at
the
moment
and
the
distance
not
great
jarvis
forgot
to
order
the
man
to
return
and
for
an
hour
the
vehicle
stood
in
one
of
the
most
public
places
in
the
city
the
consequence
was
that
when
jarvis
undertook
to
examine
into
his
gains
with
the
account
rendered
of
the
transaction
by
his
broker
he
was
astonished
to
read
sir
timothy
jarvis
in
account
with
john
smith
sir
timothy
examined
the
account
in
as
many
different
ways
as
benfield
had
examined
the
marriage
of
denbigh
before
he
would
believe
his
eyes
and
when
assured
of
the
fact
he
immediately
caught
up
his
hat
and
went
to
find
the
man
who
had
dared
to
insult
him
as
it
were
in
defiance
of
the
formality
of
business
he
had
not
proceeded
one
square
in
the
city
before
he
met
a
friend
who
spoke
to
him
by
the
title
an
explanation
of
the
mistake
followed
and
the
quasi
baronet
proceeded
to
his
stables
here
by
actual
examination
he
detected
the
fraud
an
explanation
with
his
consort
followed
and
the
painter
brush
soon
effaced
the
emblem
of
dignity
from
the
panels
of
the
coach
all
this
was
easy
but
with
his
waggish
companions
on
and
in
the
city
where
notwithstanding
his
wife
fashionable
propensities
he
loved
to
resort
he
was
sir
timothy
still
jarvis
though
a
man
of
much
modesty
was
one
of
great
decision
and
he
determined
to
have
the
laugh
on
his
side
a
newly
purchased
borough
of
his
sent
up
an
address
flaming
with
patriotism
and
it
was
presented
by
his
own
hands
the
merchant
seldom
kneeled
to
his
creator
but
on
this
occasion
he
humbled
himself
dutifully
before
his
prince
and
left
the
presence
with
a
legal
right
to
the
appellation
which
his
old
companions
had
affixed
to
him
sarcastically
the
rapture
of
lady
jarvis
may
be
more
easily
imagined
than
faithfully
described
the
christian
name
of
her
husband
alone
throwing
any
alloy
into
the
enjoyment
of
her
elevation
but
by
a
license
of
speech
she
ordered
and
addressed
in
her
own
practice
the
softer
and
more
familiar
appellation
of
sir
timo
two
servants
were
discharged
the
first
week
because
unused
to
titles
they
had
addressed
her
as
mistress
and
her
son
the
captain
then
at
a
was
made
acquainted
by
express
with
the
joyful
intelligence
all
this
time
sir
henry
egerton
was
but
little
seen
amongst
his
new
relatives
he
had
his
own
engagements
and
haunts
and
spent
most
of
his
time
at
a
fashionable
gaming
house
in
the
west
end
as
however
the
town
was
deserted
lady
jarvis
and
her
daughters
having
condescended
to
pay
a
round
of
city
visits
to
show
off
her
airs
and
dignity
to
her
old
friends
persuaded
sir
timo
that
the
hour
for
their
visit
to
bath
had
arrived
and
they
were
soon
comfortably
settled
in
that
city
lady
chatterton
and
her
youngest
daughter
had
arrived
at
the
seat
of
her
son
and
john
moseley
as
happy
as
the
certainty
of
love
returned
and
the
approbation
of
his
friends
could
make
him
was
in
lodgings
in
the
town
sir
edward
notified
his
son
of
his
approaching
visit
to
bath
and
john
took
proper
accommodations
for
the
family
which
he
occupied
for
a
few
days
by
himself
as
locum
tenens
lord
and
lady
herriefield
had
departed
for
the
south
of
france
and
kate
removed
from
the
scenes
of
her
earliest
enjoyments
and
the
bosom
of
her
own
family
and
under
the
protection
of
a
man
she
neither
loved
nor
respected
began
to
feel
the
insufficiency
of
a
name
or
of
a
fortune
to
constitute
felicity
lord
herriefield
was
of
a
suspicious
and
harsh
temper
the
first
propensity
being
greatly
increased
by
his
former
associations
and
the
latter
not
being
removed
by
the
humility
of
his
eastern
dependants
but
the
situation
of
her
child
gave
no
uneasiness
to
the
managing
mother
who
thought
her
in
the
to
happiness
and
was
gratified
at
the
result
of
her
labors
once
or
twice
indeed
her
habits
had
overcome
her
caution
so
much
as
to
endeavor
to
promote
a
day
or
two
sooner
than
had
been
arranged
the
wedding
of
grace
but
her
imprudence
was
checked
instantly
by
the
recoiling
of
moseley
from
her
insinuations
in
disgust
and
the
absence
of
the
young
man
for
four
hours
gave
her
timely
warning
of
the
danger
of
such
an
interference
with
one
of
such
fastidious
feelings
john
punished
himself
as
much
as
the
dowager
on
these
occasions
but
the
smiling
face
of
grace
with
her
hand
frankly
placed
in
his
own
at
his
return
never
failed
to
do
away
the
unpleasant
sensations
created
by
her
mother
care
the
chatterton
and
jarvis
families
met
in
the
rooms
soon
after
the
arrival
of
the
latter
when
the
lady
of
the
knight
followed
by
both
her
daughters
approached
the
dowager
with
a
most
friendly
salute
of
recognition
lady
chatterton
really
forgetful
of
the
persons
of
her
b
acquaintance
and
disliking
the
vulgarity
of
her
air
drew
up
into
an
appearance
of
great
dignity
as
she
hoped
the
lady
was
well
the
merchant
wife
felt
the
consciousness
of
rank
too
much
to
be
repulsed
in
this
manner
and
believing
that
the
dowager
had
merely
forgotten
her
face
she
added
with
a
simpering
smile
in
imitation
of
what
she
had
seen
better
bred
people
practise
with
success
lady
jarvis
my
lady
your
ladyship
do
remember
me
lady
jarvis
of
the
deanery
b
northamptonshire
and
my
daughters
lady
egerton
and
miss
jarvis
lady
egerton
bowed
stiffly
to
the
recognising
smile
the
dowager
now
condescended
to
bestow
but
sarah
remembering
a
certain
handsome
lord
in
the
family
was
more
urbane
determining
at
the
moment
to
make
the
promotion
of
her
mother
and
sister
to
greater
elevation
for
herself
i
hope
my
lord
is
well
continued
the
city
lady
i
regret
that
sir
timo
and
sir
harry
and
captain
jarvis
are
not
here
this
morning
to
pay
their
respects
to
your
ladyship
but
as
we
shall
see
naturally
a
good
deal
of
each
other
it
must
be
deferred
to
a
more
fitting
opportunity
certainly
madam
replied
the
dowager
as
passing
her
compliments
with
those
of
grace
she
drew
back
from
so
open
a
conversation
with
creatures
of
such
doubtful
standing
in
the
fashionable
world
chapter
xxxiii
on
taking
leave
of
fitzgerald
emily
and
her
aunt
settled
a
plan
of
correspondence
the
deserted
situation
of
this
young
woman
having
created
great
interest
in
the
breasts
of
her
new
friends
general
had
returned
to
spain
without
receding
from
his
original
proposal
and
his
niece
was
left
to
mourn
her
early
departure
from
one
of
the
most
solemn
duties
of
life
benfield
thwarted
in
one
of
his
most
favorite
schemes
of
happiness
for
the
residue
of
his
life
obstinately
refused
to
make
one
of
the
party
at
bath
and
ives
and
clara
having
returned
to
bolton
the
remainder
of
the
moseleys
arrived
at
the
lodgings
of
john
a
very
few
days
after
the
interview
of
the
preceding
chapter
with
hearts
ill
qualified
to
enter
into
the
gaieties
of
the
place
though
in
obedience
to
the
wishes
of
lady
moseley
to
see
and
to
be
seen
once
more
on
that
great
theatre
of
fashionable
amusement
the
friends
of
the
family
who
had
known
them
in
times
past
were
numerous
and
were
glad
to
renew
their
acquaintance
with
those
they
had
always
esteemed
so
that
they
found
themselves
immediately
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
smiling
faces
and
dashing
equipages
sir
william
harris
the
proprietor
of
the
deanery
and
a
former
neighbor
with
his
showy
daughter
were
amongst
the
first
to
visit
them
sir
william
was
a
man
of
handsome
estate
and
unexceptionable
character
but
entirely
governed
by
the
whims
and
desires
of
his
only
child
caroline
harris
wanted
neither
sense
nor
beauty
but
expecting
a
fortune
she
had
placed
her
views
too
high
she
at
first
aimed
at
the
peerage
and
while
she
felt
herself
entitled
to
suit
her
taste
as
well
as
her
ambition
had
failed
of
her
object
by
efforts
to
attain
it
she
had
justly
acquired
the
reputation
of
the
reverse
of
a
coquette
or
yet
of
a
prude
still
she
had
never
received
an
offer
and
at
the
age
of
had
now
begun
to
lower
her
thoughts
to
the
commonalty
her
fortune
would
have
easily
obtained
her
husband
here
but
she
was
determined
to
pick
amongst
the
lower
supporters
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
nation
with
the
moseleys
she
had
been
early
acquainted
though
some
years
their
senior
a
circumstance
however
to
which
she
took
care
never
to
allude
unnecessarily
the
meeting
between
grace
and
the
moseleys
was
tender
and
sincere
john
countenance
glowed
with
delight
as
he
saw
his
future
wife
folded
successively
in
the
arms
of
those
he
loved
and
grace
tears
and
blushes
added
twofold
charms
to
her
native
beauty
jane
relaxed
from
her
reserve
to
receive
her
future
sister
and
determined
with
herself
to
appear
in
the
world
in
order
to
show
sir
henry
egerton
that
she
did
not
feel
the
blow
he
had
inflicted
as
severely
as
the
truth
might
have
proved
the
dowager
found
some
little
occupation
for
a
few
days
in
settling
with
lady
moseley
the
preliminaries
of
the
wedding
but
the
latter
had
suffered
too
much
through
her
youngest
daughters
to
enter
into
these
formalities
with
her
ancient
spirit
all
things
were
however
happily
settled
and
ives
making
a
journey
for
the
express
purpose
john
and
grace
were
united
privately
at
the
altar
of
one
of
the
principal
churches
in
bath
chatterton
had
been
summoned
on
the
occasion
and
the
same
paper
which
announced
the
nuptials
contained
amongst
the
fashionable
arrivals
the
names
of
the
duke
of
derwent
and
his
sister
the
marquess
of
eltringham
and
sisters
amongst
whom
was
to
be
found
lady
laura
denbigh
lady
chatterton
carelessly
remarked
in
presence
of
her
friends
the
husband
of
the
latter
was
summoned
to
the
of
a
relative
from
whom
he
had
great
expectations
emily
color
did
certainly
change
as
she
listened
to
this
news
but
not
allowing
her
thoughts
to
dwell
on
the
subject
she
was
soon
enabled
to
recall
her
serenity
of
appearance
but
jane
and
emily
were
delicately
placed
the
lover
of
the
former
and
the
wives
of
the
lovers
of
both
were
in
the
way
of
daily
if
not
hourly
rencounters
and
it
required
all
the
energies
of
the
young
women
to
appear
with
composure
before
them
the
elder
was
supported
by
pride
the
younger
by
principle
the
first
was
restless
haughty
distant
and
repulsive
the
last
mild
humble
reserved
but
eminently
attractive
the
one
was
suspected
by
all
around
her
the
other
was
unnoticed
by
any
but
by
her
nearest
and
dearest
friends
the
first
rencounter
with
these
dreaded
guests
occurred
at
the
rooms
one
evening
where
the
elder
ladies
had
insisted
on
the
bride
making
her
appearance
the
jarvises
were
there
before
them
and
at
their
entrance
caught
the
eyes
of
the
group
lady
jarvis
approached
immediately
filled
with
exultation
her
husband
with
respect
the
latter
was
received
with
cordiality
the
former
politely
but
with
distance
the
young
ladies
and
sir
henry
bowed
distantly
and
the
gentleman
soon
drew
off
into
another
part
of
the
room
his
absence
alone
kept
jane
from
fainting
the
handsome
figure
of
egerton
standing
by
the
side
of
mary
jarvis
as
her
acknowledged
husband
was
near
proving
too
much
for
her
pride
notwithstanding
all
her
efforts
and
he
looked
so
like
the
imaginary
being
she
had
set
up
as
the
object
of
her
worship
that
her
heart
was
also
in
danger
of
rebelling
positively
sir
edward
and
my
lady
both
sir
timo
and
myself
and
i
dare
say
sir
harry
and
lady
egerton
too
are
delighted
to
see
you
comfortably
at
bath
among
us
moseley
i
wish
you
much
happiness
lady
chatterton
too
i
suppose
your
ladyship
recollects
me
now
i
am
lady
jarvis
moseley
i
regret
for
your
sake
that
my
son
captain
jarvis
is
not
here
you
were
so
fond
of
each
other
and
both
so
loved
your
guns
positively
my
lady
jarvis
said
moseley
drily
my
feelings
on
the
occasion
are
as
strong
as
your
own
but
i
presume
the
captain
is
much
too
good
a
shot
for
me
by
this
time
why
yes
he
improves
greatly
in
most
things
he
undertakes
rejoined
the
smiling
dame
and
i
hope
he
will
soon
learn
like
you
to
shoot
with
the
harrows
of
cupid
i
hope
the
honorable
moseley
is
well
grace
bowed
mildly
as
she
answered
to
the
interrogatory
and
smiled
at
the
thought
of
jarvis
put
in
competition
with
her
husband
in
this
species
of
archery
when
a
voice
immediately
behind
where
they
sat
caught
the
ears
of
the
whole
party
all
it
said
was
harriet
you
forgot
to
show
me
marian
letter
yes
but
i
will
was
the
reply
it
was
the
tone
of
denbigh
emily
almost
fell
from
her
seat
as
it
first
reached
her
and
the
eyes
of
all
but
herself
were
immediately
turned
in
quest
of
the
speaker
he
had
approached
within
a
very
few
feet
of
them
supporting
a
lady
on
each
arm
a
second
look
convinced
the
moseleys
that
they
were
mistaken
it
was
not
denbigh
but
a
young
man
whose
figure
face
and
air
resembled
him
strongly
and
whose
voice
possessed
the
same
soft
melodious
tones
which
had
distinguished
that
of
denbigh
this
party
seated
themselves
within
a
very
short
distance
of
the
moseleys
and
they
continued
their
conversation
you
heard
from
the
colonel
too
i
believe
continued
the
gentleman
turning
to
the
lady
who
sat
next
to
emily
yes
he
is
a
very
punctual
correspondent
i
hear
every
other
day
how
is
his
uncle
laura
inquired
her
female
companion
rather
better
but
i
will
thank
your
grace
to
find
the
marquess
and
miss
howard
bring
them
to
us
rejoined
the
other
yes
said
the
former
lady
with
a
laugh
and
eltringham
will
thank
you
too
i
dare
say
in
an
instant
the
duke
returned
accompanied
by
a
gentleman
of
thirty
and
an
elderly
lady
who
might
have
been
safely
taken
for
fifty
without
offence
to
anybody
but
herself
during
these
speeches
their
auditors
had
listened
with
almost
breathless
interest
emily
had
stolen
a
glance
which
satisfied
her
it
was
not
denbigh
himself
and
it
greatly
relieved
her
but
was
startled
at
discovering
that
she
was
actually
seated
by
the
side
of
his
young
and
lovely
wife
when
an
opportunity
offered
she
dwelt
on
the
amiable
frank
countenance
of
her
rival
with
melancholy
satisfaction
at
least
she
thought
he
may
yet
be
happy
and
i
hope
penitent
it
was
a
mixture
of
love
and
gratitude
which
prompted
this
wish
both
sentiments
not
easily
got
rid
of
when
once
ingrafted
in
our
better
feelings
john
eyed
the
strangers
with
a
displeasure
for
which
he
could
not
account
at
once
and
saw
in
the
ancient
lady
the
bridesmaid
lord
henry
had
so
unwillingly
admitted
to
that
distinction
lady
jarvis
was
astounded
with
her
vicinity
to
so
much
nobility
and
she
drew
back
to
her
family
to
study
its
movements
to
advantage
while
lady
chatterton
sighed
heavily
as
she
contemplated
the
fine
figures
of
an
unmarried
duke
and
marquess
and
she
without
a
single
child
to
dispose
of
the
remainder
of
the
party
continued
to
view
them
with
curiosity
and
listened
with
interest
to
what
they
said
two
or
three
young
ladies
had
now
joined
the
strangers
attended
by
a
couple
of
gentlemen
and
the
conversation
became
general
the
ladies
declined
dancing
entirely
but
appeared
willing
to
throw
away
an
hour
in
comments
on
their
neighbors
william
said
one
of
the
young
ladies
there
is
your
old
messmate
col
egerton
yes
i
observe
him
replied
her
brother
i
see
him
but
smiling
significantly
he
continued
we
are
messmates
no
longer
he
is
a
sad
character
said
the
marquess
with
a
shrug
william
i
would
advise
you
to
be
cautious
of
his
acquaintance
i
thank
you
replied
lord
william
but
i
believe
i
understand
him
thoroughly
jane
manifested
strong
emotion
during
these
remarks
while
sir
edward
and
his
wife
averted
their
faces
from
a
simultaneous
feeling
of
reproach
their
eyes
met
and
mutual
concessions
were
contained
in
the
glance
yet
their
feelings
were
unnoticed
by
their
companions
for
over
the
fulfilment
of
her
often
repeated
forewarnings
of
neglect
and
duty
to
our
children
wilson
had
mourned
in
sincerity
but
she
had
forgotten
to
triumph
when
are
we
to
see
pendennyss
inquired
the
marquess
i
hope
he
will
be
here
with
george
i
have
a
mind
to
beat
up
his
quarters
in
wales
this
season
what
say
you
derwent
i
intend
it
if
i
can
persuade
lady
harriet
to
quit
the
gaieties
of
bath
so
soon
what
say
you
sister
will
you
be
in
readiness
to
attend
me
so
early
this
question
was
asked
in
an
arch
tone
and
drew
the
eyes
of
her
friends
on
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
i
am
ready
now
frederick
if
you
wish
it
answered
the
sister
hastily
and
coloring
excessively
as
she
spoke
but
where
is
chatterton
i
thought
he
was
here
he
had
a
sister
married
here
last
week
inquired
lord
william
stapleton
addressing
no
one
in
particular
a
slight
movement
in
their
neighbors
attracted
the
attention
of
the
party
what
a
lovely
young
woman
whispered
the
duke
to
lady
laura
your
neighbor
is
the
lady
smiled
her
assent
and
as
emily
overheard
it
she
rose
with
glowing
cheeks
and
proposed
a
walk
round
the
room
chatterton
soon
after
entered
the
young
peer
had
acknowledged
to
emily
that
deprived
of
hope
as
he
had
been
by
her
firm
refusal
of
his
hand
his
efforts
had
been
directed
to
the
suppression
of
a
passion
which
could
never
be
successful
but
his
esteem
his
respect
remained
in
full
force
he
did
not
touch
at
all
on
the
subject
of
denbigh
and
she
supposed
that
he
thought
his
marriage
was
a
step
that
required
justification
the
moseleys
had
commenced
their
promenade
round
the
room
as
chatterton
came
in
he
paid
his
compliments
to
them
as
soon
as
he
entered
and
walked
with
their
party
the
noble
visitors
followed
their
example
and
the
two
parties
met
chatterton
was
delighted
to
see
them
the
duke
was
particularly
fond
of
him
and
had
one
been
present
of
sufficient
observation
the
agitation
of
his
sister
the
lady
harriet
denbigh
would
have
accounted
for
the
doubts
of
her
brother
as
respects
her
willingness
to
leave
bath
a
few
words
of
explanation
passed
the
duke
and
his
friends
appeared
to
urge
something
on
chatterton
who
acted
as
their
ambassador
and
the
consequence
was
an
introduction
of
the
two
parties
to
each
other
this
was
conducted
with
the
ease
of
the
present
fashion
it
was
general
and
occurred
as
it
were
incidentally
in
the
course
of
the
evening
both
lady
harriet
and
lady
laura
denbigh
were
particularly
attentive
to
emily
they
took
their
seats
by
her
and
manifested
a
preference
for
her
conversation
that
struck
wilson
as
remarkable
could
it
be
that
the
really
attractive
manners
and
beauty
of
her
niece
had
caught
the
fancy
of
these
ladies
or
was
there
a
deeper
seated
cause
for
the
desire
to
draw
emily
out
that
both
of
them
evinced
wilson
had
heard
a
rumor
that
chatterton
was
thought
attentive
to
lady
harriet
and
the
other
was
the
wife
of
denbigh
was
it
possible
the
quondam
suitors
of
her
niece
had
related
to
their
present
favorites
the
situation
they
had
stood
in
as
regarded
emily
it
was
odd
to
say
no
more
and
the
widow
dwelt
on
the
innocent
countenance
of
the
bride
with
pity
and
admiration
emily
herself
was
not
a
little
abashed
at
the
notice
of
her
new
acquaintances
especially
lady
laura
but
as
their
admiration
appeared
sincere
as
well
as
their
desire
to
be
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
the
moseleys
they
parted
on
the
whole
mutually
pleased
the
conversation
several
times
was
embarrassing
to
the
baronet
family
and
at
moments
distressingly
so
to
their
daughters
at
the
close
of
the
evening
they
all
formed
one
group
at
a
little
distance
from
the
rest
of
the
company
and
in
a
situation
to
command
a
view
of
it
who
is
that
woman
said
lady
sarah
stapleton
seated
next
to
sir
henry
egerton
brother
no
less
a
personage
than
my
lady
jarvis
replied
the
marquess
gravely
and
the
of
sir
harry
and
the
wife
to
sir
timo
this
was
said
with
a
look
of
drollery
that
showed
the
marquess
was
a
bit
of
a
quiz
married
cried
lord
william
mercy
on
the
woman
who
is
wife
he
is
the
greatest
latitudinarian
amongst
the
ladies
of
any
man
in
england
nothing
no
nothing
would
tempt
me
to
let
such
a
man
marry
a
sister
of
mine
ah
thought
wilson
how
we
may
be
deceived
in
character
with
the
best
intentions
after
all
in
what
are
the
open
vices
of
egerton
worse
than
the
more
hidden
ones
of
denbigh
these
freely
expressed
opinions
on
the
character
of
sir
henry
were
excessively
awkward
to
some
of
the
listeners
to
whom
they
were
connected
with
unpleasant
recollections
of
duties
neglected
and
affections
thrown
away
sir
edward
moseley
was
not
disposed
to
judge
his
harshly
and
it
was
as
much
owing
to
his
philanthropy
as
to
his
indolence
that
he
had
been
so
remiss
in
his
attention
to
the
associates
of
his
daughters
but
the
veil
once
removed
and
the
consequences
brought
home
to
him
through
his
child
no
man
was
more
alive
to
the
necessity
of
caution
on
this
important
particular
and
sir
edward
formed
many
salutary
resolutions
for
the
government
of
his
future
conduct
in
relation
to
those
whom
an
experience
nearly
fatal
in
its
results
had
now
greatly
qualified
to
take
care
of
themselves
but
to
resume
our
narrative
lady
laura
had
maintained
with
emily
a
conversation
which
was
enlivened
by
occasional
remarks
from
the
rest
of
the
party
in
the
course
of
which
the
nerves
as
well
as
the
principles
of
emily
were
put
to
a
severe
trial
my
brother
henry
said
lady
laura
who
is
a
captain
in
the
navy
once
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
miss
moseley
and
in
some
measure
made
me
acquainted
with
you
before
we
met
i
dined
with
lord
henry
at
l
and
was
much
indebted
to
his
polite
attentions
in
an
excursion
on
the
water
replied
emily
simply
oh
i
am
sure
his
attentions
were
exclusive
cried
the
sister
indeed
he
told
us
that
nothing
but
want
of
time
prevented
his
being
deeply
in
love
he
had
even
the
audacity
to
tell
denbigh
it
was
fortunate
for
me
he
had
never
seen
you
or
i
should
have
been
left
to
lead
apes
and
i
suppose
you
believe
him
now
cried
lord
william
laughing
as
he
bowed
to
emily
his
sister
laughed
in
her
turn
but
shook
her
head
in
the
confidence
of
conjugal
affection
it
is
all
conjecture
for
the
colonel
said
he
had
never
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
meeting
miss
moseley
so
i
will
not
boast
of
what
my
powers
might
have
done
miss
moseley
continued
lady
laura
blushing
slightly
at
her
inclination
to
talk
of
an
absent
husband
so
lately
her
lover
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
colonel
denbigh
to
you
soon
i
think
said
emily
with
a
strong
horror
of
deception
and
a
mighty
struggle
to
suppress
her
feelings
colonel
denbigh
was
mistaken
in
saying
that
we
had
never
met
he
was
of
material
service
to
me
once
and
i
owe
him
a
debt
of
gratitude
that
i
only
wish
i
could
properly
repay
lady
laura
listened
in
surprise
but
as
emily
paused
she
could
not
delicately
as
his
wife
remind
her
further
of
the
obligation
by
asking
what
the
service
was
and
hesitating
a
moment
continued
henry
quite
made
you
the
subject
of
conversation
amongst
us
lord
chatterton
too
who
visited
us
for
a
day
was
equally
warm
in
his
eulogiums
i
really
thought
they
created
a
curiosity
in
the
duke
and
pendennyss
to
behold
their
idol
a
curiosity
that
would
be
ill
rewarded
in
its
indulgence
said
emily
abashed
by
the
personality
of
the
discourse
so
says
the
modesty
of
miss
moseley
said
the
duke
of
derwent
in
the
peculiar
tone
which
distinguished
the
softer
keys
of
denbigh
voice
emily
heart
beat
quick
as
she
heard
them
and
she
was
afterwards
vexed
to
remember
with
how
much
pleasure
she
had
listened
to
this
opinion
of
the
duke
was
it
the
sentiment
or
was
it
the
voice
she
however
gathered
strength
to
answer
with
a
dignity
that
repressed
further
praises
your
grace
is
willing
to
divest
me
of
what
little
i
possess
pendennyss
is
a
man
of
a
thousand
continued
lady
laura
with
the
privilege
of
a
married
woman
i
do
wish
he
would
join
us
at
bath
is
there
no
hope
duke
i
am
afraid
not
replied
his
grace
he
keeps
himself
immured
in
wales
with
his
sister
who
is
as
much
of
a
hermit
as
he
is
himself
there
was
a
story
of
an
inamorata
in
private
somewhere
cried
the
marquess
why
at
one
time
it
was
even
said
he
was
privately
married
to
her
scandal
my
lord
said
the
duke
gravely
pendennyss
is
of
unexceptionable
morals
and
the
lady
you
mean
is
the
widow
of
major
fitzgerald
whom
you
knew
pendennyss
never
sees
her
though
by
accident
he
was
once
of
very
great
service
to
her
wilson
breathed
freely
again
as
she
heard
this
explanation
and
thought
if
the
marquess
knew
all
how
differently
would
he
judge
pendennyss
as
well
as
others
oh
i
have
the
highest
opinion
of
lord
pendennyss
cried
the
marquess
the
moseleys
were
not
sorry
that
the
usual
hour
of
retiring
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
and
their
embarrassment
chapter
xxxiv
during
the
succeeding
fortnight
the
intercourse
between
the
moseleys
and
their
new
acquaintances
increased
daily
it
was
rather
awkward
at
first
on
the
part
of
emily
and
her
beating
pulse
and
changing
color
too
often
showed
the
alarm
of
feelings
not
yet
overcome
when
any
allusions
were
made
to
the
absent
husband
of
one
of
the
ladies
still
as
her
parents
encouraged
the
acquaintance
and
her
aunt
thought
the
best
way
to
get
rid
of
the
remaining
weakness
with
respect
to
denbigh
was
not
to
shrink
from
even
an
interview
with
the
gentleman
himself
emily
succeeded
in
conquering
her
reluctance
and
as
the
high
opinion
entertained
by
lady
laura
of
her
husband
was
expressed
in
a
thousand
artless
ways
an
interest
was
created
in
her
that
promised
in
time
to
weaken
if
not
destroy
the
impression
that
had
been
made
by
denbigh
himself
on
the
other
hand
egerton
carefully
avoided
all
collision
with
the
moseleys
once
indeed
he
endeavored
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
john
but
a
haughty
repulse
almost
produced
a
quarrel
what
representations
egerton
had
thought
proper
to
make
to
his
wife
we
are
unable
to
say
but
she
appeared
to
resent
something
as
she
never
approached
the
dwelling
or
persons
of
her
quondam
associates
although
in
her
heart
she
was
dying
to
be
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
their
titled
friends
her
incorrigible
mother
was
restrained
by
no
such
or
any
other
consideration
and
contrived
to
fasten
on
the
dowager
and
lady
harriet
a
kind
of
bowing
acquaintance
which
she
made
great
use
of
at
the
rooms
the
duke
sought
out
the
society
of
emily
wherever
he
could
obtain
it
and
wilson
thought
her
niece
admitted
his
approaches
with
less
reluctance
than
that
of
any
other
of
the
gentlemen
around
her
at
first
she
was
surprised
but
a
closer
observation
betrayed
to
her
the
latent
cause
derwent
resembled
denbigh
greatly
in
person
and
voice
although
there
were
distinctions
easily
to
be
made
on
an
acquaintance
the
duke
had
an
air
of
command
and
hauteur
that
was
never
to
be
seen
in
his
cousin
but
his
admiration
of
emily
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
and
as
he
ever
addressed
her
in
the
respectful
language
and
identical
voice
of
denbigh
the
observant
widow
easily
perceived
that
it
was
the
remains
of
her
attachment
to
the
one
that
induced
her
niece
to
listen
with
such
evident
pleasure
to
the
conversation
of
the
other
the
duke
of
derwent
wanted
many
of
the
indispensable
requisites
of
a
husband
in
the
eyes
of
wilson
yet
as
she
thought
emily
out
of
all
danger
at
the
present
of
any
new
attachment
she
admitted
the
association
under
no
other
restraint
than
the
uniform
propriety
of
all
that
emily
said
or
did
your
niece
will
one
day
be
a
duchess
wilson
whispered
lady
laura
as
derwent
and
emily
were
running
over
a
new
poem
one
morning
in
the
lodgings
of
sir
edward
the
former
reading
a
fine
extract
aloud
so
strikingly
in
the
air
and
voice
of
denbigh
as
to
call
all
the
animation
of
the
unconscious
emily
into
her
expressive
face
wilson
sighed
as
she
reflected
on
the
strength
of
those
feelings
which
even
principles
and
testimony
had
not
been
able
wholly
to
subdue
as
she
answered
not
of
derwent
i
believe
but
how
wonderfully
the
duke
resembles
your
husband
at
times
she
added
entirely
thrown
off
her
guard
lady
laura
was
evidently
surprised
yes
at
times
he
does
they
are
brothers
children
you
know
the
voice
in
all
that
connexion
is
remarkable
pendennyss
though
a
degree
further
off
in
blood
possesses
it
and
lady
harriet
you
perceive
has
the
same
characteristic
there
has
been
some
syren
in
the
family
in
days
past
sir
edward
and
lady
moseley
saw
the
attention
of
the
duke
with
the
greatest
pleasure
though
not
slaves
to
the
ambition
of
wealth
and
rank
they
were
certainly
no
objections
in
their
eyes
and
a
proper
suitor
lady
moseley
thought
the
most
probable
means
of
driving
the
recollection
of
denbigh
from
the
mind
of
her
daughter
the
latter
consideration
had
great
weight
in
inducing
her
to
cultivate
an
acquaintance
so
embarrassing
on
many
accounts
the
colonel
however
wrote
to
his
wife
the
impossibility
of
his
quitting
his
uncle
while
he
continued
so
unwell
and
it
was
settled
that
the
bride
should
join
him
under
the
escort
of
lord
william
the
same
tenderness
distinguished
denbigh
on
this
occasion
that
had
appeared
so
lovely
when
exercised
to
his
dying
father
yet
thought
wilson
how
insufficient
are
good
feelings
to
effect
what
can
only
be
the
result
of
good
principles
caroline
harris
was
frequently
of
the
parties
of
pleasure
walks
rides
and
dinners
which
the
moseleys
were
compelled
to
join
in
and
as
the
marquess
of
eltringham
had
given
her
one
day
some
little
encouragement
she
determined
to
make
an
expiring
effort
at
the
peerage
before
she
condescended
to
enter
into
an
examination
of
the
qualities
of
capt
jarvis
who
his
mother
had
persuaded
her
was
an
apollo
that
had
great
hopes
of
being
one
day
a
lord
as
both
the
captain
and
herself
had
commenced
laying
up
a
certain
sum
quarterly
for
the
purpose
of
buying
a
title
hereafter
an
ingenious
expedient
of
jarvis
to
get
into
his
hands
a
portion
of
the
allowance
of
his
mother
eltringham
was
strongly
addicted
to
the
ridiculous
and
without
committing
himself
in
the
least
drew
the
lady
out
on
divers
occasions
for
the
amusement
of
himself
and
the
duke
who
enjoyed
without
practising
that
species
of
joke
the
collisions
between
art
and
as
irony
had
been
practised
with
impunity
by
the
marquess
for
a
fortnight
and
the
lady
imagination
began
to
revel
in
the
delights
of
a
triumph
when
a
really
respectable
offer
was
made
to
miss
harris
by
a
neighbor
of
her
father
in
the
country
one
she
would
rejoice
to
have
received
a
few
days
before
but
which
in
consequence
of
hopes
created
by
the
following
occurrence
she
haughtily
rejected
it
was
at
the
lodgings
of
the
baronet
that
lady
laura
exclaimed
one
day
marriage
is
a
lottery
certainly
and
neither
sir
henry
nor
lady
egerton
appears
to
have
drawn
a
prize
here
jane
stole
from
the
room
never
sister
cried
the
marquess
i
will
deny
that
any
man
can
select
a
prize
from
your
sex
if
he
only
knows
his
own
taste
taste
is
a
poor
criterion
i
am
afraid
said
wilson
gravely
on
which
to
found
matrimonial
felicity
to
what
would
you
refer
the
decision
my
dear
madam
inquired
the
lady
laura
judgment
lady
laura
shook
her
hear
doubtingly
you
remind
me
so
much
of
lord
pendennyss
everything
he
wishes
to
bring
under
the
subjection
of
judgment
and
principles
and
is
he
wrong
lady
laura
asked
wilson
pleased
to
find
such
correct
views
existed
in
one
of
whom
she
thought
so
highly
not
wrong
my
dear
madam
only
impracticable
what
do
you
think
marquess
of
choosing
a
wife
in
conformity
to
your
principles
and
without
consulting
your
tastes
wilson
shook
her
head
with
a
laugh
and
disclaimed
any
such
statement
of
the
case
but
the
marquess
who
disliked
one
of
didactic
conversations
very
much
gaily
interrupted
her
by
saying
oh
taste
is
everything
with
me
the
woman
of
my
heart
against
the
world
if
she
suits
my
fancy
and
satisfies
my
judgment
and
what
may
this
fancy
of
your
lordship
be
said
wilson
willing
to
gratify
the
trifling
what
kind
of
a
woman
do
you
mean
to
choose
how
tall
for
instance
why
madam
cried
the
marquess
rather
unprepared
for
such
a
catechism
and
looking
around
him
until
the
outstretched
neck
and
the
eager
attention
of
caroline
harris
caught
his
eye
when
he
added
with
an
air
of
great
simplicity
about
the
height
of
miss
harris
how
old
asked
wilson
with
a
smile
not
too
young
certainly
i
am
my
wife
must
be
five
or
six
and
twenty
am
i
old
enough
do
you
think
derwent
he
added
in
a
whisper
to
the
duke
within
ten
years
was
the
reply
wilson
continued
she
must
read
and
write
i
suppose
why
faith
said
the
marquess
i
am
not
fond
of
a
bookish
sort
of
a
woman
and
least
of
all
a
scholar
you
had
better
take
miss
howard
whispered
his
brother
she
is
old
enough
never
reads
and
is
just
the
height
no
no
will
rejoined
the
brother
rather
too
old
that
now
i
admire
a
woman
who
has
confidence
in
herself
one
that
understands
the
proprieties
of
life
and
has
if
possible
been
at
the
head
of
an
establishment
before
she
is
to
take
charge
of
mine
the
delighted
caroline
wriggled
about
in
her
chair
and
unable
to
contain
herself
longer
inquired
noble
blood
of
course
you
would
require
my
lord
why
no
i
rather
think
the
best
wives
are
to
be
found
in
a
medium
i
would
wish
to
elevate
my
wife
myself
a
baronet
daughter
for
instance
here
lady
jarvis
who
had
entered
during
the
dialogue
and
caught
a
clue
to
the
topic
they
were
engaged
in
drew
near
and
ventured
to
ask
if
he
thought
a
simple
knight
too
low
the
marquess
who
did
not
expect
such
an
attack
was
a
little
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
but
recovering
himself
answered
gravely
under
the
apprehension
of
another
design
on
his
person
that
he
did
think
that
would
be
forgetting
his
duty
to
his
descendants
lady
jarvis
sighed
and
fell
back
in
disappointment
while
miss
harris
turning
to
the
nobleman
in
a
soft
voice
desired
him
to
ring
for
her
carriage
as
he
handed
her
down
she
ventured
to
inquire
if
his
lordship
had
ever
met
with
such
a
woman
as
he
described
oh
miss
harris
he
whispered
as
he
handed
her
into
the
coach
how
can
you
ask
me
such
a
question
you
are
very
cruel
drive
on
coachman
how
cruel
my
lord
said
miss
harris
eagerly
stop
john
how
cruel
my
lord
and
she
stretched
her
neck
out
of
the
window
as
the
marquess
kissing
his
hand
to
her
ordered
the
man
to
proceed
do
you
hear
your
lady
sir
lady
jarvis
had
followed
them
down
also
with
a
view
to
catch
anything
which
might
be
said
having
apologized
for
her
hasty
visit
and
as
the
marquess
handed
her
politely
into
her
carriage
she
also
begged
he
would
favor
sir
timo
and
sir
henry
with
a
call
which
being
promised
eltringham
returned
to
the
room
when
am
i
to
salute
a
marchioness
of
eltringham
cried
lady
laura
to
her
brother
one
on
the
new
standard
set
up
by
your
lordship
whenever
miss
harris
can
make
up
her
mind
to
the
sacrifice
replied
the
brother
very
gravely
ah
me
how
very
considerate
some
of
your
sex
are
for
the
modesty
of
ours
i
wish
you
joy
with
all
my
heart
my
lord
marquess
exclaimed
john
moseley
i
was
once
favored
with
the
notice
of
that
same
lady
for
a
week
or
two
but
a
viscount
saved
me
from
capture
i
really
think
moseley
said
the
duke
innocently
but
speaking
with
animation
an
intriguing
daughter
worse
than
a
managing
mother
john
gravity
for
a
moment
vanished
as
he
replied
in
a
lowered
key
oh
much
worse
grace
heart
was
in
her
throat
until
by
stealing
a
glance
at
her
husband
she
saw
the
cloud
passing
over
his
fine
brow
and
happening
to
catch
her
affectionate
smile
his
face
was
at
once
lighted
into
a
look
of
pleasantry
i
would
advise
caution
my
lord
caroline
harris
has
the
advantage
of
experience
in
her
trade
and
was
expert
from
the
first
john
john
said
sir
edward
with
warmth
sir
william
is
my
friend
and
his
daughter
must
be
respected
then
baronet
cried
the
marquess
she
has
one
recommendation
i
was
ignorant
of
and
as
such
i
am
silent
but
ought
not
sir
william
to
teach
his
daughter
to
respect
herself
i
view
these
ladies
as
pirates
on
the
ocean
of
love
and
lawful
objects
for
any
roving
cruiser
like
myself
to
fire
at
at
one
time
i
was
simple
enough
to
retire
as
they
advanced
but
you
know
madam
turning
to
wilson
with
a
droll
look
flight
only
encourages
pursuit
so
i
now
give
battle
in
defence
and
i
hope
successfully
my
lord
observed
the
lady
miss
harris
brother
does
appear
to
have
grown
desperate
in
her
attacks
which
were
formerly
much
more
masked
than
at
present
i
believe
it
is
generally
the
case
when
a
young
worman
throws
aside
the
delicacy
and
feelings
which
ought
to
be
the
characteristics
of
her
sex
and
which
teach
her
studiously
to
conceal
her
admiration
that
she
either
becomes
in
time
cynical
and
disagreeable
to
all
around
her
from
disappointment
or
persevering
in
her
efforts
as
it
were
runs
a
muck
for
a
husband
now
in
justice
to
the
gentlemen
i
must
say
baronet
there
are
strong
symptoms
of
the
malay
about
caroline
harris
a
muck
a
muck
cried
the
marquess
as
in
obedience
to
the
signal
of
his
sister
he
rose
to
withdraw
jane
had
retired
to
her
own
room
in
a
mortification
of
spirit
she
could
ill
conceal
during
this
conversation
and
she
felt
a
degree
of
humiliation
which
almost
drove
her
to
the
desperate
resolution
of
hiding
herself
for
ever
from
the
world
the
man
she
had
so
fondly
enshrined
in
her
heart
proving
to
be
so
notoriously
unworthy
as
to
be
the
subject
of
unreserved
censure
in
general
company
was
a
reproach
to
her
delicacy
her
observation
her
judgment
that
was
the
more
severe
from
being
true
and
she
wept
in
bitterness
over
her
fallen
happiness
emily
had
noticed
the
movement
of
jane
and
waited
anxiously
for
the
departure
of
the
visitors
to
hasten
to
her
room
she
knocked
two
or
three
times
before
her
sister
replied
to
her
request
for
admittance
jane
my
dear
jane
said
emily
soothingly
will
you
not
admit
me
jane
could
not
resist
any
longer
the
affection
of
her
sister
and
the
door
was
opened
but
as
emily
endeavored
to
take
her
hand
she
drew
back
coldly
and
cried
i
wonder
you
who
are
so
happy
will
leave
the
gay
scene
below
for
the
society
of
an
humbled
wretch
like
me
and
overcome
with
the
violence
of
her
emotion
she
burst
into
tears
happy
repeated
emily
in
a
tone
of
anguish
happy
did
you
say
jane
oh
little
do
you
know
my
sufferings
or
you
would
never
speak
so
cruelly
jane
in
her
turn
surprised
at
the
strength
of
emily
language
considered
her
weeping
sister
with
commiseration
and
then
her
thoughts
recurring
to
her
own
case
she
continued
with
energy
yes
emily
happy
for
whatever
may
have
been
the
reason
of
conduct
he
is
respected
and
if
you
do
or
did
love
him
he
was
worthy
of
it
but
i
said
jane
wildly
threw
away
my
affections
on
a
mere
impostor
and
i
am
miserable
for
ever
no
dear
jane
rejoined
emily
having
recovered
her
not
miserable
nor
for
ever
you
have
many
very
many
sources
of
happiness
yet
within
your
reach
even
in
this
world
i
i
do
think
even
our
strongest
attachments
may
be
overcome
by
energy
and
a
sense
of
duty
and
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
see
you
make
the
effort
for
a
moment
the
voice
of
the
youthful
moralist
had
failed
her
but
anxiety
in
behalf
of
her
sister
overcame
her
feelings
and
she
ended
the
sentence
with
earnestness
emily
said
jane
with
obstinacy
and
yet
in
tears
you
do
know
what
blighted
affections
are
to
endure
the
scorn
of
the
world
and
see
the
man
you
once
thought
near
being
your
husband
married
to
another
who
is
showing
herself
in
triumph
before
you
wherever
you
go
hear
me
jane
before
you
reproach
me
further
and
then
judge
between
us
emily
paused
a
moment
to
acquire
nerve
to
proceed
and
then
related
to
her
astonished
sister
the
little
history
of
her
own
disappointments
she
did
not
affect
to
conceal
her
attachment
for
denbigh
with
glowing
cheeks
she
acknowledged
that
she
found
a
necessity
for
all
her
efforts
to
keep
her
rebellious
feelings
yet
in
subjection
and
as
she
recounted
generally
his
conduct
to
fitzgerald
she
concluded
by
saying
but
jane
i
can
see
enough
to
call
forth
my
gratitude
and
although
with
yourself
i
feel
at
this
moment
as
if
my
affections
were
sealed
for
ever
i
wish
to
make
no
hasty
resolutions
nor
act
in
any
manner
as
if
i
were
unworthy
of
the
lot
providence
has
assigned
me
unworthy
no
you
have
no
reasons
for
if
denbigh
has
had
the
art
to
conceal
his
crimes
from
you
he
did
it
to
the
rest
of
the
world
also
and
has
married
a
woman
of
rank
and
character
but
how
differently
are
we
situated
emily
i
i
have
no
such
consolation
you
have
the
consolation
my
sister
of
knowing
there
is
an
interest
made
for
you
where
we
all
require
it
most
and
it
is
there
i
endeavor
to
seek
my
support
said
emily
in
a
low
and
humble
tone
a
review
of
our
own
errors
takes
away
the
keenness
of
our
perception
of
the
wrongs
done
us
and
by
placing
us
in
charity
with
the
rest
of
the
world
disposes
us
to
enjoy
calmly
the
blessings
within
our
reach
besides
jane
we
have
parents
whose
happiness
is
locked
up
in
that
of
their
children
and
we
should
we
must
overcome
the
feelings
which
disqualify
us
for
our
common
duties
on
their
account
ah
cried
jane
how
can
i
move
about
in
the
world
while
i
know
the
eyes
of
all
are
on
me
in
curiosity
to
discover
how
i
bear
my
disappointments
but
you
emily
are
unsuspected
it
is
easy
for
you
to
affect
a
gaiety
you
do
not
feel
i
neither
affect
nor
feel
any
gaiety
said
her
sister
mildly
but
are
there
not
the
eyes
of
one
on
us
of
infinitely
more
power
to
punish
or
reward
than
what
may
be
found
in
the
opinions
of
the
world
have
we
no
duties
for
what
is
our
wealth
our
knowledge
our
time
given
us
but
to
improve
for
our
own
and
for
the
eternal
welfare
of
those
around
us
come
then
my
sister
we
have
both
been
deceived
let
us
endeavor
not
to
be
culpable
i
wish
from
my
soul
we
could
leave
bath
cried
jane
the
place
the
people
are
hateful
to
me
jane
said
emily
rather
say
you
hate
their
vices
and
wish
for
their
amendment
but
do
not
indiscriminately
condemn
a
whole
community
for
the
wrongs
you
have
sustained
from
one
of
its
members
jane
allowed
herself
to
be
consoled
though
by
no
means
convinced
by
this
effort
of
her
sister
and
they
both
found
a
relief
by
thus
unburdening
their
hearts
to
each
other
that
in
future
brought
them
more
nearly
together
and
was
of
mutual
assistance
in
supporting
them
in
the
promiscuous
circles
in
which
they
were
obliged
to
mix
with
all
her
fortitude
and
principle
one
of
the
last
things
emily
would
have
desired
was
an
interview
with
denbigh
and
she
was
happily
relieved
from
the
present
danger
of
it
by
the
departure
of
lady
laura
and
her
brother
to
go
to
the
residence
of
the
colonel
sick
uncle
both
wilson
and
emily
suspected
that
a
dread
of
meeting
them
had
detained
him
from
his
intended
journey
to
bath
and
neither
was
sorry
to
perceive
what
they
considered
as
latent
signs
of
grace
a
grace
of
which
egerton
appeared
entirely
to
be
without

emily
and
then
as
the
image
of
denbigh
rose
in
her
imagination
surrounded
with
the
domestic
virtues
she
roused
herself
from
the
dangerous
reflection
to
the
exercise
of
the
duties
in
which
she
found
a
refuge
from
unpardonable
wishes

nothing
material
occurred
for
a
fortnight
after
the
departure
of
lady
laura
the
moseleys
entering
soberly
into
the
amusements
of
the
place
and
derwent
and
chatterton
becoming
more
pointed
every
day
in
their
attentions
the
one
to
emily
and
the
other
to
lady
harriet
when
the
dowager
received
a
pressing
entreaty
from
catherine
to
hasten
to
her
at
lisbon
where
her
husband
had
taken
up
his
abode
for
a
time
after
much
doubt
and
indecision
as
to
his
place
of
residence
lady
herriefield
stated
generally
in
her
letter
that
she
was
miserable
and
that
without
the
support
of
her
mother
she
could
not
exist
under
the
present
grievances
but
what
was
the
cause
of
those
grievances
or
what
grounds
she
had
for
her
misery
she
left
unexplained
lady
chatterton
was
not
wanting
in
maternal
regard
and
she
promptly
determined
to
proceed
to
portugal
in
the
next
packet
john
felt
inclined
for
a
little
excursion
with
his
bride
and
out
of
compassion
to
the
baron
who
was
in
a
dilemma
between
his
duty
and
his
love
for
lady
harriet
about
that
time
was
particularly
attractive
he
offered
his
services
chatterton
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
by
the
john
that
his
mother
could
safely
cross
the
ocean
under
the
protection
of
the
latter
accordingly
at
the
end
of
the
before
mentioned
fortnight
the
dowager
john
grace
and
jane
commenced
their
journey
to
falmouth
jane
had
offered
to
accompany
grace
as
a
companion
in
her
return
it
being
expected
lady
chatterton
would
remain
in
the
country
with
her
daughter
and
her
parents
appreciating
her
motives
permitted
the
excursion
with
a
hope
it
would
draw
her
thoughts
from
past
events
although
grace
shed
a
few
tears
at
parting
with
emily
and
her
friends
it
was
impossible
for
moseley
to
be
long
unhappy
with
the
face
of
john
smiling
by
her
side
and
they
pursued
their
route
uninterruptedly
in
due
season
they
reached
the
port
of
embarkation
the
following
morning
the
packet
got
under
weigh
and
a
favorable
breeze
soon
wafted
them
out
of
sight
of
their
native
shores
the
ladies
were
too
much
indisposed
the
first
day
to
appear
on
the
deck
but
the
weather
becoming
calm
and
the
sea
smooth
grace
and
jane
ventured
out
of
the
confinement
of
their
to
respire
the
fresh
air
above
there
were
but
few
passengers
and
those
chiefly
ladies
the
wives
of
officers
on
foreign
stations
on
their
way
to
join
their
husbands
as
these
had
been
accustomed
to
moving
in
the
world
their
disposition
to
accommodate
soon
removed
the
awkwardness
of
a
first
meeting
and
our
travellers
began
to
be
at
home
in
their
novel
situation
while
grace
stood
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
husband
and
clinging
to
his
support
both
from
affection
and
a
dread
of
the
motion
of
the
vessel
jane
ventured
with
one
of
the
ladies
to
attempt
a
walk
round
the
deck
of
the
ship
unaccustomed
to
such
an
uncertain
foothold
the
walkers
were
prevented
falling
by
the
kind
interposition
of
a
gentleman
who
for
the
first
time
had
shown
himself
among
them
at
that
moment
the
accident
and
their
situation
led
to
a
conversation
which
was
renewed
at
different
times
during
their
passage
and
in
some
measure
created
an
intimacy
between
our
party
and
the
stranger
he
was
addressed
by
the
commander
of
the
vessel
as
harland
and
lady
chatterton
exercised
her
ingenuity
in
the
investigation
of
his
history
by
which
she
made
the
following
discovery
the
rev
and
hon
harland
was
the
younger
son
of
an
irish
earl
who
had
early
embraced
his
sacred
profession
in
that
church
in
which
he
held
a
valuable
living
in
the
gift
of
his
father
family
his
father
was
yet
alive
and
then
at
lisbon
with
his
mother
and
sister
in
attendance
on
his
elder
brother
who
had
been
sent
there
in
a
deep
decline
a
couple
of
months
before
it
had
been
the
wish
of
his
parents
to
have
taken
all
their
children
with
them
but
a
sense
of
duty
had
kept
the
young
clergyman
in
the
exercise
of
his
holy
office
until
a
request
of
his
dying
brother
and
the
directions
of
his
father
caused
him
to
hasten
abroad
to
witness
the
decease
of
the
one
and
to
afford
all
the
solace
within
his
power
to
the
others
it
may
be
easily
imagined
that
the
discovery
of
the
rank
of
their
accidental
acquaintance
with
the
almost
certainty
that
existed
of
his
being
the
heir
of
his
father
honors
in
no
degree
impaired
his
consequence
in
the
eyes
of
the
dowager
and
it
is
certain
his
visible
anxiety
and
depressed
spirits
his
unaffected
piety
and
disinterested
hopes
for
his
brother
recovery
no
less
elevated
him
in
the
opinions
of
her
companions
there
was
at
the
moment
a
kind
of
sympathy
between
harland
and
jane
notwithstanding
the
melancholy
which
gave
rise
to
it
proceeding
from
such
very
different
causes
and
as
the
lady
although
with
diminished
bloom
retained
all
her
personal
charms
rather
heightened
than
otherwise
by
the
softness
of
low
spirits
the
young
clergyman
sometimes
relieved
his
apprehensions
of
his
brother
death
by
admitting
the
image
of
jane
among
his
more
melancholy
reflections
the
voyage
was
tedious
and
some
time
before
it
was
ended
the
dowager
had
given
grace
an
intimation
of
the
probability
there
was
of
becoming
at
some
future
day
a
countess
grace
sincerely
hoped
that
whatever
she
became
she
would
be
as
happy
as
she
thought
all
allied
to
john
deserved
to
be
they
entered
the
bay
of
lisbon
early
in
the
morning
and
as
the
ship
had
been
expected
for
some
days
a
boat
came
alongside
with
a
note
for
harland
before
they
had
anchored
it
apprised
him
of
the
death
of
his
brother
the
young
man
threw
himself
precipitately
into
it
and
was
soon
employed
in
one
of
the
loveliest
offices
of
his
vocation
that
of
healing
the
wounds
of
the
afflicted
lady
herriefield
received
her
mother
in
a
sort
of
sullen
satisfaction
and
her
companions
with
an
awkwardness
she
could
ill
conceal
it
required
no
great
observation
in
the
travellers
to
discover
that
their
arrival
was
entirely
unexpected
by
the
viscount
if
it
were
not
equally
disagreeable
indeed
one
day
residence
under
his
roof
assured
them
all
that
no
great
degree
of
domestic
felicity
was
an
inmate
of
the
dwelling
from
the
moment
lord
herriefield
became
suspicious
that
he
had
been
the
dupe
of
the
management
of
kate
and
her
mother
he
viewed
every
act
of
his
wife
with
a
prejudiced
eye
it
was
easy
with
his
knowledge
of
human
nature
to
detect
her
selfishness
and
for
as
these
were
faults
she
was
unconscious
of
possessing
so
she
was
unguarded
in
her
exposure
of
them
but
her
designs
in
a
matrimonial
point
of
view
having
ended
with
her
marriage
had
the
viscount
treated
her
with
any
of
the
courtesies
due
her
sex
and
station
she
might
with
her
disposition
have
been
contented
in
the
enjoyment
of
rank
and
in
the
possession
of
wealth
but
their
more
private
hours
were
invariably
rendered
unpleasant
by
the
overflowings
of
her
husband
resentment
at
having
been
deceived
in
his
judgment
of
the
female
sex
there
is
no
point
upon
which
men
are
more
tender
than
their
privilege
of
suiting
themselves
in
a
partner
for
life
although
many
of
both
sexes
are
influenced
in
this
important
selection
more
by
the
wishes
and
whims
of
others
than
is
usually
suspected
yet
as
all
imagine
what
is
the
result
of
contrivance
and
management
is
the
election
of
free
will
and
taste
so
long
as
they
are
ignorant
they
are
contented
lord
herriefield
wanted
this
bliss
of
ignorance
and
with
contempt
for
his
wife
was
mingled
anger
at
his
own
want
of
foresight
very
few
people
can
tamely
submit
to
and
as
the
cause
of
this
irritated
state
of
mind
was
both
not
only
constantly
present
but
completely
within
his
power
the
viscount
seemed
determined
to
give
her
as
little
reason
to
exult
in
the
success
of
her
plans
as
possible
jealous
he
was
from
temperament
from
bad
associations
and
a
want
of
confidence
in
the
principles
of
his
wife
the
freedom
of
foreign
manners
having
an
additional
tendency
to
excite
this
baneful
passion
to
an
unusual
degree
abridged
in
her
pleasures
reproached
with
motives
she
was
incapable
of
harboring
and
disappointed
in
all
those
enjoyments
her
mother
had
ever
led
her
to
believe
the
invariable
accompaniments
of
married
life
where
proper
attention
had
been
paid
to
the
necessary
qualifications
of
riches
and
rank
kate
had
written
to
the
dowager
with
the
hope
her
presence
might
restrain
or
her
advice
teach
her
successfully
to
oppose
the
unfeeling
conduct
of
the
viscount
lady
chatterton
never
having
implanted
any
of
her
favorite
systems
in
her
daughter
so
much
by
precept
as
by
the
force
of
example
in
her
own
person
as
well
as
by
indirect
eulogiums
on
certain
people
who
were
endowed
with
those
qualities
and
blessings
she
most
admired
on
the
present
occasion
catherine
did
not
unburden
herself
in
terms
to
her
mother
but
by
a
regular
gradation
of
complaints
aimed
more
at
the
world
than
at
her
husband
she
soon
let
the
knowing
dowager
see
their
application
and
in
the
end
completely
removed
the
veil
from
her
domestic
grievances
the
example
of
john
and
grace
for
a
short
time
awed
the
peer
into
dissembling
his
disgust
for
his
spouse
but
the
ice
once
broken
their
presence
soon
ceased
to
affect
either
the
frequency
or
the
severity
of
his
remarks
when
under
its
influence
from
such
exhibitions
of
matrimonial
discord
grace
shrank
timidly
into
the
retirement
of
her
room
and
jane
with
dignity
would
follow
her
example
while
john
at
times
became
a
listener
with
a
spirit
barely
curbed
within
the
bounds
of
prudence
and
at
others
he
sought
in
the
company
of
his
wife
and
sister
relief
from
the
violence
of
his
feelings
john
never
admired
nor
respected
catherine
for
she
wanted
those
very
qualities
he
chiefly
loved
in
her
sister
yet
as
she
was
a
woman
and
one
nearly
connected
with
him
he
found
it
impossible
to
remain
a
quiet
spectator
of
the
unmanly
treatment
she
often
received
from
her
husband
he
therefore
made
preparations
for
his
return
to
england
by
the
first
packet
abridging
his
intended
residence
in
lisbon
more
than
a
month
lady
chatterton
endeavored
all
within
her
power
to
heal
the
breach
between
kate
and
her
husband
but
it
greatly
exceeded
her
abilities
it
was
too
late
to
implant
such
principles
in
her
daughter
as
by
a
long
course
of
and
submission
might
have
won
the
love
of
the
viscount
had
the
mother
been
acquainted
with
them
herself
so
that
having
induced
her
child
to
marry
with
a
view
to
obtaining
precedence
and
a
jointure
she
once
more
set
to
work
to
undo
part
of
her
former
labors
by
bringing
about
a
decent
separation
between
the
husband
and
wife
in
such
a
manner
as
to
secure
to
her
child
the
possession
of
her
wealth
and
the
esteem
of
the
world
the
latter
though
certainly
a
somewhat
difficult
undertaking
was
greatly
lessened
by
the
assistance
of
the
former
john
and
his
wife
determined
to
seize
the
opportunity
to
examine
the
environs
of
the
city
in
one
of
these
daily
rides
they
met
their
fellow
traveller
now
lord
harland
he
was
rejoiced
to
see
them
again
and
hearing
of
their
intended
departure
informed
them
of
his
being
about
to
return
to
england
in
the
same
vessel
his
parents
and
sister
contemplating
ending
the
winter
in
portugal
the
intercourse
between
the
two
families
was
kept
up
with
a
show
of
civilities
between
the
noblemen
and
much
real
on
the
part
of
the
juniors
of
the
circle
until
the
day
arrived
for
the
sailing
of
the
packet
lady
chatterton
was
left
behind
with
catherine
as
yet
unable
to
circumvent
her
schemes
with
prudence
it
being
deemed
by
the
world
a
worse
offence
to
separate
than
to
join
together
one
children
in
the
bands
of
wedlock
the
confinement
of
a
vessel
is
very
propitious
to
those
intimacies
which
lead
to
attachments
the
necessity
of
being
agreeable
is
a
check
upon
the
captious
and
the
desire
to
lessen
the
dulness
of
the
scene
a
stimulus
to
the
lively
and
though
the
noble
divine
and
jane
could
not
possibly
be
ranked
in
either
class
the
effect
was
the
same
the
noble
man
was
much
enamored
and
jane
unconsciously
gratified
it
is
true
love
had
never
entered
her
thoughts
in
its
direct
and
unequivocal
form
but
admiration
is
so
consoling
to
those
laboring
under
condemnation
and
flattery
of
a
certain
kind
so
very
soothing
to
all
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
that
she
listened
with
increasing
pleasure
to
the
interesting
conversation
of
harland
on
all
occasions
and
more
particularly
as
often
happened
when
exclusively
addressed
to
herself
grace
had
of
late
reflected
more
seriously
on
the
subject
of
her
eternal
welfare
than
she
had
been
accustomed
to
do
in
the
house
of
her
mother
and
the
example
of
emily
with
the
precepts
of
wilson
had
not
been
thrown
away
upon
her
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
more
women
feel
a
disposition
to
religion
soon
after
marriage
than
at
any
other
period
of
life
and
whether
it
is
that
having
attained
the
most
important
station
this
life
affords
the
sex
they
are
more
willing
to
turn
their
thoughts
to
a
provision
for
the
next
or
whether
it
be
owing
to
any
other
cause
moseley
was
included
in
the
number
she
became
sensibly
touched
with
her
situation
and
as
harland
was
both
devout
and
able
as
well
as
anxious
to
instruct
one
of
the
party
at
least
had
cause
to
rejoice
in
the
journey
for
the
remainder
of
her
days
but
precisely
as
grace
increased
in
her
own
faith
so
did
her
anxiety
after
the
welfare
of
her
husband
receive
new
excitement
and
john
for
the
first
time
became
the
cause
of
sorrow
to
his
affectionate
companion
the
deep
interest
harland
took
in
the
opening
conviction
of
moseley
did
not
so
entirely
engross
his
thoughts
as
to
prevent
the
too
frequent
contemplation
of
the
charms
of
her
friend
for
his
own
peace
of
mind
and
by
the
time
the
vessel
reached
falmouth
he
had
determined
to
make
a
tender
of
his
hand
and
title
to
the
acceptance
of
miss
moseley
jane
did
not
love
egerton
on
the
contrary
she
despised
him
but
the
time
had
been
when
all
her
romantic
feelings
every
thought
of
her
brilliant
imagination
had
been
filled
with
his
image
and
jane
felt
it
a
species
of
indelicacy
to
admit
the
impression
of
another
so
soon
or
even
at
all
these
objections
would
in
time
have
been
overcome
as
her
affections
became
more
and
more
enlisted
on
behalf
of
harland
had
she
admitted
his
addresses
but
there
was
an
impediment
that
jane
considered
insurmountable
to
a
union
with
any
man
she
had
once
communicated
her
passion
to
its
object
there
had
been
the
confidence
of
approved
love
and
she
had
now
no
heart
for
harland
but
one
that
had
avowedly
been
a
slave
to
another
to
conceal
this
from
him
would
be
unjust
and
not
reconcilable
to
good
faith
to
confess
it
humiliating
and
without
the
pale
of
probability
it
was
the
misfortune
of
jane
to
keep
the
world
too
constantly
before
her
and
to
lose
sight
too
much
of
her
really
depraved
nature
to
relish
the
idea
of
humbling
herself
so
low
in
the
opinion
of
a
the
refusal
of
harland
offer
was
the
consequence
although
she
had
begun
to
feel
an
esteem
for
him
that
would
no
doubt
have
given
rise
to
an
attachment
in
time
far
stronger
and
more
deeply
seated
than
her
passing
fancy
for
colonel
egerton
had
been
if
the
horror
of
imposing
on
the
credulity
of
harland
a
wounded
heart
was
creditable
to
jane
and
showed
an
elevation
of
character
that
under
proper
guidance
would
have
placed
her
in
the
first
ranks
of
her
sex
the
pride
which
condemned
her
to
a
station
nature
did
not
design
her
for
was
irreconcilable
with
the
humility
a
just
view
of
her
condition
could
not
fail
to
produce
and
the
second
sad
consequence
of
the
indulgent
weakness
of
her
parents
was
confirming
their
child
in
passions
directly
at
variance
with
the
first
duties
of
a
christian
we
have
so
little
right
to
value
ourselves
on
anything
that
pride
is
a
sentiment
of
very
doubtful
service
and
one
certainly
that
is
unable
to
effect
any
useful
results
which
will
not
equally
flow
from
good
principles
harland
was
disappointed
and
grieved
but
prudently
judging
that
occupation
and
absence
would
remove
recollections
which
could
not
be
very
deep
they
parted
at
falmouth
and
our
travellers
proceeded
on
their
journey
for
b
whither
during
their
absence
sir
family
had
returned
to
spend
a
month
before
they
removed
to
town
for
the
residue
of
the
winter
the
meeting
of
the
two
parties
was
warm
and
tender
and
as
jane
had
many
things
to
recount
and
john
as
many
to
laugh
at
their
arrival
threw
a
gaiety
around
moseley
hall
to
which
it
had
for
months
been
a
stranger
one
of
the
first
acts
of
grace
after
her
return
was
to
enter
strictly
into
the
exercise
of
all
those
duties
and
ordinances
required
by
her
church
and
the
present
state
of
her
mind
and
from
the
hands
of
ives
she
received
her
first
communion
at
the
altar
as
the
season
had
now
become
far
advanced
and
the
fashionable
world
had
been
some
time
assembled
in
the
metropolis
the
baronet
commenced
his
arrangements
to
take
possession
of
his
after
an
interval
of
nineteen
years
john
proceeded
to
the
capital
first
and
the
necessary
domestics
procured
furniture
supplied
and
other
arrangements
usual
to
the
appearance
of
a
wealthy
family
in
the
world
having
been
completed
he
returned
with
the
information
that
all
was
ready
for
their
triumphal
entrance
sir
edward
feeling
that
a
separation
for
so
long
a
time
and
at
such
an
unusual
distance
in
the
very
advanced
age
of
benfield
would
be
improper
paid
him
a
visit
with
the
intention
of
persuading
him
to
make
one
of
his
family
for
the
next
four
months
emily
was
his
companion
and
their
solicitations
were
happily
crowned
with
a
success
they
had
not
anticipated
averse
to
be
deprived
of
peter
society
the
honest
steward
was
included
in
the
party
nephew
said
benfield
beginning
to
waver
in
his
objections
to
the
undertaking
as
the
arguments
pro
and
con
were
produced
there
are
instances
of
gentlemen
not
in
parliament
going
to
town
in
the
winter
i
know
you
are
one
yourself
and
old
sir
john
cowel
who
never
could
get
in
although
he
ran
for
every
city
in
the
kingdom
never
missed
his
winter
in
soho
yes
yes
the
thing
is
admissible
but
had
i
known
your
wishes
before
i
would
certainly
have
kept
my
borough
if
it
were
only
for
the
appearance
of
the
thing
besides
continued
the
old
man
shaking
his
head
his
majesty
ministers
require
the
aid
of
some
more
experienced
members
in
these
critical
times
for
what
should
an
old
man
like
me
do
in
westminster
unless
it
were
to
aid
his
country
with
his
advice
make
his
friends
happy
with
his
company
dear
uncle
said
emily
taking
his
hand
between
both
her
own
and
smiling
affectionately
on
the
old
gentleman
as
she
spoke
ah
emmy
dear
cried
benfield
looking
on
her
with
melancholy
pleasure
you
are
not
to
be
resisted
just
such
another
as
the
sister
of
my
old
friend
lord
gosford
she
could
always
coax
me
out
of
anything
i
remember
now
i
heard
the
earl
tell
her
once
he
could
not
afford
to
buy
a
pair
of
diamond
and
she
looked
only
looked
did
not
speak
emmy
that
i
bought
them
with
intent
to
present
them
to
her
myself
and
did
she
take
them
uncle
asked
his
niece
in
a
little
surprise
oh
yes
when
i
told
her
if
she
did
not
i
would
throw
them
into
the
river
as
no
one
else
should
wear
what
had
been
intended
for
her
poor
soul
how
delicate
and
unwilling
she
was
i
had
to
convince
her
they
cost
three
hundred
pounds
before
she
would
listen
to
it
and
then
she
thought
it
such
a
pity
to
throw
away
a
thing
of
so
much
value
it
would
have
been
wicked
you
know
emmy
dear
and
she
was
much
opposed
to
wickedness
and
sin
in
any
shape
she
must
have
been
a
very
unexceptionable
character
indeed
cried
the
baronet
with
a
smile
as
he
proceeded
to
make
the
necessary
orders
for
their
journey
but
we
must
return
to
the
party
left
at
bath
chapter
xxxvi
the
letters
of
lady
laura
informed
her
friends
that
she
and
colonel
denbigh
had
decided
to
remain
with
his
uncle
until
the
recovery
of
the
latter
was
complete
and
then
to
proceed
to
denbigh
castle
to
meet
the
duke
and
his
sister
during
the
approaching
holidays
emily
was
much
relieved
by
this
postponement
of
an
interview
which
she
would
gladly
have
avoided
for
ever
and
her
aunt
sincerely
rejoiced
that
her
niece
was
allowed
more
time
to
eradicate
impressions
which
she
saw
with
pain
her
charge
had
yet
a
struggle
to
overcome
there
were
so
many
points
to
admire
in
the
character
of
denbigh
his
friends
spoke
of
him
with
such
decided
partiality
ives
in
his
frequent
letters
alluded
to
him
with
so
much
affection
that
emily
frequently
detected
herself
in
weighing
the
testimony
of
his
guilt
and
indulging
the
expectation
that
circumstances
had
deceived
them
all
in
their
judgment
of
his
conduct
then
his
marriage
would
cross
her
mind
and
with
the
conviction
of
the
impropriety
of
admitting
him
to
her
thoughts
at
all
would
come
the
mass
of
circumstantial
testimony
which
had
accumulated
against
him
derwent
served
greatly
to
keep
alive
the
recollections
of
his
person
however
and
as
lady
harriet
seemed
to
live
only
in
the
society
of
the
moseleys
not
a
day
passed
without
giving
the
duke
some
opportunity
of
indirectly
preferring
his
suit
emily
not
only
appeared
but
in
fact
was
unconscious
of
his
admiration
and
entered
into
their
amusements
with
a
satisfaction
that
was
increased
by
the
belief
that
the
unfortunate
attachment
her
cousin
chatterton
had
once
professed
for
herself
was
forgotten
in
the
more
certain
enjoyments
of
a
successful
love
lady
harriet
was
a
woman
of
manners
and
character
very
different
from
emily
moseley
yet
had
she
in
a
great
measure
erased
the
impressions
made
by
the
beauty
of
his
kinswoman
from
the
bosom
of
the
baron
chatterton
under
the
depression
of
his
first
disappointment
it
will
be
remembered
had
left
b
in
company
with
denbigh
the
interest
of
the
duke
had
been
unaccountably
exerted
to
procure
him
the
place
he
had
so
long
solicited
in
vain
and
gratitude
required
his
early
acknowledgments
for
the
favor
his
manner
so
very
different
from
a
successful
applicant
for
a
valuable
office
had
struck
both
derwent
and
his
sister
as
singular
before
however
a
week
intercourse
had
passed
between
them
his
own
frankness
had
made
them
acquainted
with
the
cause
and
a
double
wish
prevailed
in
the
bosom
of
lady
harriet
to
know
the
woman
who
could
resist
the
beauty
of
chatterton
and
to
relieve
him
from
the
weight
imposed
on
his
spirits
by
disappointed
affection
the
manners
of
lady
harriet
denbigh
were
not
in
the
least
forward
or
masculine
but
they
had
the
freedom
of
high
rank
mingled
with
a
good
deal
of
the
ease
of
fashionable
life
wilson
noticed
moreover
in
her
conduct
to
chatterton
a
something
exceeding
the
interest
of
ordinary
communications
in
their
situation
which
might
possibly
have
been
attributed
more
to
feeling
than
to
manner
it
is
certain
one
of
the
surest
methods
to
drive
emily
from
his
thoughts
was
to
dwell
on
the
perfections
of
some
other
lady
and
lady
harriet
was
so
constantly
before
him
in
his
visit
into
westmoreland
so
soothing
so
evidently
pleased
with
his
presence
that
the
baron
made
rapid
advances
in
attaining
his
object
he
had
alluded
in
his
letter
to
emily
to
the
obligation
he
was
under
to
the
services
of
denbigh
in
erasing
his
unfortunate
partiality
for
her
but
what
those
services
were
we
are
unable
to
say
unless
they
were
the
usual
arguments
of
the
plainest
good
sense
enforced
in
the
singularly
insinuating
and
kind
manner
which
distinguished
that
gentleman
in
fact
lord
chatterton
was
not
formed
by
nature
to
love
long
deprived
of
hope
or
to
resist
long
the
flattery
of
a
preference
from
such
a
woman
as
harriet
denbigh
on
the
other
hand
derwent
was
warm
in
his
encomiums
on
emily
to
all
but
herself
and
wilson
again
thought
it
prudent
to
examine
into
the
state
of
her
feelings
in
order
to
discover
if
there
was
any
danger
of
his
unremitted
efforts
drawing
emily
into
a
connexion
that
neither
her
religion
nor
prudence
could
wholly
approve
derwent
was
a
man
of
the
world
a
christian
only
in
name
and
the
cautious
widow
determined
to
withdraw
in
season
should
she
find
grounds
for
her
apprehensions
about
ten
days
after
the
departure
of
the
dowager
and
her
companions
lady
harriet
exclaimed
in
one
of
her
morning
visits
lady
moseley
i
have
now
hopes
of
presenting
to
you
soon
the
most
polished
man
in
the
united
kingdom
as
a
husband
lady
harriet
inquired
the
other
with
a
smile
oh
no
only
as
a
cousin
a
second
cousin
madam
replied
lady
harriet
blushing
a
little
and
looking
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
one
in
which
chatterton
was
placed
but
his
name
you
forget
our
curiosity
what
is
his
name
cried
wilson
entering
into
the
trifling
for
the
moment
pendennyss
to
be
sure
my
dear
madam
whom
else
can
i
mean
and
you
expect
the
earl
at
bath
wilson
eagerly
inquired
he
has
given
us
such
hopes
and
derwent
has
written
him
pressing
the
journey
you
will
be
disappointed
i
am
afraid
sister
said
the
duke
pendennyss
has
become
so
fond
of
wales
of
late
that
it
is
difficult
to
get
him
out
of
it
but
said
wilson
he
will
take
his
seat
in
parliament
during
the
winter
my
lord
i
hope
he
will
madam
though
lord
eltringham
holds
his
proxies
in
my
absence
in
all
important
questions
before
the
house
your
grace
will
attend
i
trust
said
sir
edward
the
pleasure
of
your
company
is
among
my
expected
enjoyments
in
the
town
you
are
very
good
sir
edward
replied
the
duke
looking
at
emily
it
will
somewhat
depend
on
circumstances
i
believe
lady
harriet
smiled
and
the
speech
seemed
understood
by
all
but
the
lady
most
concerned
in
it
lord
pendennyss
is
a
universal
favorite
and
deservedly
so
cried
the
duke
he
has
set
an
example
to
the
nobility
which
few
are
equal
to
imitate
an
only
son
with
an
immense
estate
he
has
devoted
himself
to
the
profession
of
a
soldier
and
gained
great
reputation
by
it
in
the
world
nor
has
he
neglected
any
of
his
private
duties
as
a
man
or
a
christian
i
hope
said
wilson
delighted
with
the
praises
of
the
earl
nor
of
a
christian
i
believe
continued
the
duke
he
appears
consistent
humble
and
sincere
three
requisites
i
believe
for
that
character
does
not
your
grace
know
said
emily
with
a
benevolent
smile
derwent
colored
slightly
as
he
answered
not
as
well
as
i
ought
but
lowering
his
voice
for
her
ear
alone
he
added
under
proper
instruction
i
think
i
might
learn
then
i
would
recommend
that
book
to
you
my
lord
rejoined
emily
with
a
blush
pointing
to
a
pocket
bible
which
lay
near
her
though
still
ignorant
of
the
allusion
he
meant
to
convey
may
i
ask
the
honor
of
an
audience
of
miss
moseley
said
derwent
in
the
same
low
tone
whenever
her
leisure
will
admit
of
her
granting
the
favor
emily
was
surprised
but
from
the
previous
conversation
and
the
current
of
her
thoughts
at
the
moment
supposing
his
communication
had
some
reference
to
the
subject
before
them
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
unobtrusively
but
certainly
with
an
air
of
perfect
innocence
and
composure
she
went
into
the
adjoining
room
the
door
of
which
was
open
very
near
them
caroline
harris
had
abandoned
all
ideas
of
a
coronet
with
the
departure
of
the
marquess
of
eltringham
and
his
sisters
for
their
own
seat
and
as
a
final
effort
of
her
fading
charms
had
begun
to
calculate
the
capabilities
of
captain
jarvis
who
had
at
this
time
honored
bath
with
his
company
it
is
true
the
lady
would
have
greatly
preferred
her
father
neighbor
but
that
was
an
irretrievable
step
he
had
retired
disgusted
with
her
haughty
dismissal
of
his
hopes
and
was
a
man
who
although
he
greatly
admired
her
fortune
was
not
to
be
recalled
by
any
beck
or
smile
which
might
grow
out
of
caprice
lady
jarvis
had
indeed
rather
magnified
the
personal
qualifications
of
her
son
but
the
disposition
they
had
manifested
to
devote
some
of
their
surplus
wealth
to
purchasing
a
title
had
great
weight
for
miss
harris
would
cheerfully
at
any
time
have
sacrificed
one
half
her
own
fortune
to
be
called
my
lady
jarvis
would
make
but
a
lord
is
true
but
then
what
a
lord
wife
would
she
not
make
herself
his
father
was
a
merchant
to
be
sure
but
then
merchants
were
always
immensely
rich
and
a
few
thousand
pounds
properly
applied
might
make
the
merchant
son
a
baron
she
therefore
resolved
to
inquire
the
first
opportunity
into
the
condition
of
the
sinking
fund
of
his
plebeianism
and
had
serious
thoughts
of
contributing
her
mite
towards
the
advancement
of
the
desired
object
did
she
find
it
within
the
bounds
of
probable
success
an
occasion
soon
offered
by
the
invitation
of
the
captain
to
accompany
him
in
an
excursion
in
the
tilbury
of
his
in
this
ride
they
passed
the
equipages
of
lady
harriet
and
wilson
with
their
respective
mistresses
taking
an
airing
in
passing
the
latter
jarvis
bowed
for
he
had
renewed
his
acquaintance
at
the
rooms
without
daring
to
visit
at
the
lodgings
of
sir
edward
and
miss
harris
saw
both
parties
as
they
dashed
by
them
you
know
the
moseleys
caroline
said
jarvis
with
the
freedom
her
manners
had
established
between
them
yes
replied
the
lady
drawing
her
head
back
from
a
view
of
the
carriages
what
fine
arms
those
of
the
duke
are
and
the
coronet
it
is
so
noble
so
rich
i
am
sure
if
i
were
a
man
laying
great
emphasis
on
the
word
i
would
be
a
lord
if
you
could
you
mean
cried
the
captain
could
why
money
will
buy
a
title
you
know
only
most
people
are
fonder
of
their
cash
than
of
honor
that
right
said
the
unreflecting
captain
money
is
the
thing
after
all
now
what
do
you
suppose
our
last
came
to
oh
do
talk
of
eating
and
drinking
cried
miss
harris
in
affected
aversion
is
it
beneath
the
consideration
of
nobility
then
any
one
may
be
a
lord
for
me
said
jarvis
drily
if
they
are
not
to
eat
and
drink
why
what
do
they
live
for
but
such
sort
of
things
a
soldier
lives
to
fight
and
gain
honor
and
distinction
for
his
harris
would
have
added
had
she
spoken
all
she
thought
a
poor
way
that
of
spending
a
man
time
said
the
captain
now
there
is
captain
jones
in
our
regiment
they
say
he
loves
fighting
as
much
as
eating
if
he
do
he
is
a
bloodthirsty
fellow
you
know
how
intimate
i
am
with
your
dear
mother
continued
the
lady
bent
on
the
principal
object
she
has
made
me
acquainted
with
her
greatest
wish
her
greatest
wish
cried
the
captain
in
astonishment
why
what
can
that
be
a
new
coach
and
horses
no
i
mean
one
much
dearer
to
us
i
should
say
to
her
than
any
such
trifles
she
has
told
me
of
the
plan
plan
said
jarvis
still
in
wonder
what
plan
about
the
fund
for
the
peerage
you
know
of
course
the
thing
is
sacred
with
me
as
indeed
i
am
equally
interested
with
you
all
in
its
success
jarvis
eyed
her
with
a
knowing
look
and
as
she
concluded
rolling
his
eyes
in
an
expression
of
significance
he
said
what
serve
sir
william
some
such
way
eh
i
will
assist
a
little
if
it
be
necessary
henry
said
the
lady
tenderly
although
my
mite
can
not
amount
to
a
great
deal
during
this
speech
the
captain
was
wondering
what
she
could
mean
but
having
had
a
suspicion
from
something
that
had
fallen
from
his
mother
that
the
lady
was
intended
for
him
as
a
wife
and
that
she
might
be
as
great
a
dupe
as
lady
jarvis
herself
he
was
resolved
to
know
the
whole
and
to
act
accordingly
i
think
it
might
be
made
to
do
he
replied
evasively
in
order
to
discover
the
extent
of
his
companion
information
do
cried
miss
harris
with
fervor
it
can
not
fail
how
much
do
you
suppose
will
be
wanting
to
buy
a
barony
for
instance
hem
said
jarvis
you
mean
more
than
we
have
already
certainly
why
about
a
thousand
pounds
i
think
will
do
it
with
what
we
have
said
jarvis
affecting
to
calculate
is
that
all
cried
the
delighted
caroline
and
the
captain
grew
in
an
instant
in
her
estimation
three
inches
higher
quite
noble
in
his
air
and
in
short
very
tolerably
handsome
from
that
moment
miss
harris
in
her
own
mind
had
fixed
the
fate
of
captain
jarvis
and
had
determined
to
be
his
wife
whenever
she
could
persuade
him
to
offer
himself
a
thing
she
had
no
doubt
of
accomplishing
with
comparative
ease
not
so
the
captain
like
all
weak
men
there
was
nothing
of
which
he
stood
more
in
terror
than
of
ridicule
he
had
heard
the
manoeuvres
of
miss
harris
laughed
at
by
many
of
the
young
men
in
bath
and
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
add
himself
to
the
food
for
mirth
of
these
wags
and
indeed
had
cultivated
her
acquaintance
with
a
kind
of
bravado
to
some
of
his
bottle
companions
in
order
to
show
his
ability
to
oppose
all
her
arts
when
most
exposed
to
them
for
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
to
the
success
of
this
description
of
ladies
that
their
characters
soon
become
suspected
and
do
them
infinitely
more
injury
than
all
their
skill
in
their
vocation
with
these
views
in
the
respective
champions
the
campaign
opened
and
the
lady
on
her
return
acquainted
his
mother
with
the
situation
of
the
privy
purse
that
was
to
promote
her
darling
child
to
the
enviable
distinction
of
the
peerage
lady
jarvis
was
for
purchasing
a
baronetcy
on
the
spot
with
what
they
had
under
the
impression
that
when
ready
for
another
promotion
they
would
only
have
to
pay
the
difference
as
they
did
in
the
army
when
he
received
his
captaincy
as
however
the
son
was
opposed
to
any
arrangement
that
might
make
the
producing
the
few
hundred
pounds
he
had
obtained
from
his
mother
folly
necessary
she
was
obliged
to
postpone
the
day
until
their
united
efforts
could
compass
the
means
of
effecting
the
main
point
as
an
earnest
however
of
her
spirit
in
the
cause
she
gave
him
a
fifty
pound
note
that
morning
obtained
from
her
husband
and
which
the
captain
lost
at
one
throw
of
the
dice
to
his
the
same
evening
during
the
preceding
events
egerton
had
either
studiously
avoided
all
collision
with
the
moseleys
or
his
engagements
had
confined
him
to
such
very
different
scenes
that
they
never
met
the
baronet
had
felt
his
presence
a
reproach
and
lady
moseley
rejoiced
that
egerton
yet
possessed
sufficient
shame
to
keep
him
from
insulting
her
with
his
company
it
was
a
month
after
the
departure
of
lady
chatterton
that
sir
edward
returned
to
b
as
related
in
the
preceding
chapter
and
that
the
arrangements
for
the
london
winter
were
commenced
the
day
preceding
their
leaving
bath
the
engagement
of
chatterton
with
lady
harriet
was
made
public
amongst
their
mutual
friends
and
an
intimation
was
given
that
their
nuptials
would
be
celebrated
before
the
family
of
the
duke
left
his
seat
for
the
capital
something
of
the
pleasure
that
she
had
for
a
long
time
been
a
stranger
to
was
felt
by
emily
moseley
as
the
well
remembered
tower
of
the
village
church
of
b
struck
her
sight
on
their
return
from
their
protracted
excursion
more
than
four
months
had
elapsed
since
they
had
commenced
their
travels
and
in
that
period
what
changes
of
sentiments
had
she
not
witnessed
in
others
of
opinions
of
mankind
in
general
and
of
one
individual
in
particular
had
she
not
experienced
in
her
own
person
the
benevolent
smiles
the
respectful
salutations
they
received
in
passing
the
little
group
of
houses
which
clustered
round
the
church
had
obtained
the
name
of
the
village
conveyed
a
sensation
of
delight
that
can
only
be
felt
by
the
deserving
and
virtuous
and
the
smiling
faces
in
several
instances
glistening
with
tears
which
met
them
at
the
hall
gave
ample
testimony
to
the
worth
of
both
the
master
and
his
servants
francis
and
clara
were
in
waiting
to
receive
them
and
a
very
few
minutes
elapsed
before
the
rector
and
ives
having
heard
they
had
passed
drove
in
also
in
saluting
the
different
members
of
the
family
wilson
noticed
the
startled
look
of
the
doctor
as
the
change
in
emily
appearance
first
met
his
eyes
her
bloom
if
not
gone
was
greatly
diminished
and
it
was
only
when
under
the
excitement
of
strong
emotions
that
her
face
possessed
that
radiance
which
had
so
eminently
distinguished
it
before
her
late
journey
where
did
you
last
see
my
friend
george
said
the
doctor
to
wilson
in
the
course
of
the
first
afternoon
as
he
took
a
seat
by
her
side
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
family
at
l
said
wilson
gravely
l
cried
the
doctor
in
evident
amazement
was
he
not
at
bath
then
during
your
stay
there
no
i
understand
he
was
in
attendance
on
some
sick
relative
which
detained
him
from
his
friends
said
wilson
wondering
why
the
doctor
chose
to
introduce
so
delicate
a
topic
of
his
guilt
in
relation
to
fitzgerald
he
was
doubtless
ignorant
but
surely
not
of
his
marriage
it
is
now
some
time
since
i
heard
from
him
continued
the
doctor
regarding
wilson
expressively
but
to
which
the
lady
only
replied
with
a
gentle
inclination
of
the
body
and
the
rector
after
pausing
a
moment
continued
you
will
not
think
me
impertinent
if
i
am
bold
enough
to
ask
has
george
ever
expressed
a
wish
to
become
connected
with
your
niece
by
other
ties
than
those
of
friendship
he
did
answered
the
widow
after
a
little
hesitation
he
did
and
was
refused
continued
wilson
with
a
slight
feeling
for
the
dignity
of
her
sex
which
for
a
moment
caused
her
to
lose
sight
of
justice
to
denbigh
ives
was
silent
but
manifested
by
his
dejected
countenance
the
interest
he
had
taken
in
this
anticipated
connexion
and
as
wilson
had
spoken
with
reluctance
on
the
subject
at
all
the
rector
did
not
attempt
a
renewal
of
the
disagreeable
chapter
xxxvii
samvenson
has
returned
and
i
certainly
must
hear
from
harriet
exclaimed
the
sister
of
pendennyss
as
she
stood
at
a
window
watching
the
return
of
a
servant
from
the
neighboring
i
am
afraid
rejoined
the
earl
who
was
seated
by
the
breakfast
table
waiting
the
leisure
of
the
lady
to
give
him
his
cup
of
tea
you
find
wales
very
dull
sister
i
sincerely
hope
both
derwent
and
harriet
will
not
forget
their
promise
of
visiting
us
this
month
the
lady
slowly
took
her
seat
at
the
table
engrossed
in
her
own
reflections
when
the
man
entered
with
his
budget
of
news
and
having
deposited
sundry
papers
and
letters
he
respectfully
withdrew
the
earl
glanced
his
eyes
over
the
directions
of
the
epistles
and
turning
to
his
servants
said
answer
the
bell
when
called
three
or
four
liveried
footmen
deposited
their
silver
salvers
and
different
implements
of
servitude
and
the
peer
and
his
sister
were
left
to
themselves
here
is
one
from
the
duke
to
me
and
one
for
you
from
his
sister
said
the
brother
i
propose
they
be
read
aloud
for
our
mutual
advantage
to
this
proposal
the
lady
whose
curiosity
to
hear
the
contents
of
derwent
letter
greatly
exceeded
her
interest
in
that
of
his
sister
cheerfully
acquiesced
and
her
brother
first
broke
the
seal
of
his
own
epistle
and
read
its
contents
as
follow
notwithstanding
my
promise
of
seeing
you
this
month
in
caernarvonshire
i
remain
here
yet
my
dear
pendennyss
unable
to
tear
myself
from
the
attractions
i
have
found
in
this
city
although
the
pleasure
of
their
contemplation
has
been
purchased
at
the
expense
of
mortified
feelings
and
unrequited
affections
it
is
a
truth
though
possibly
difficult
to
be
believed
that
this
mercenary
age
has
produced
a
female
disengaged
young
and
by
no
means
very
rich
who
has
refused
a
jointure
of
six
thousand
a
year
with
the
privilege
of
walking
at
a
coronation
within
a
dozen
of
royalty
itself
here
the
accidental
falling
of
a
cup
from
the
hands
of
the
fair
listener
caused
some
little
interruption
to
the
reading
of
the
brother
but
as
the
lady
with
a
good
deal
of
trepidation
and
many
blushes
apologized
hastily
for
the
confusion
her
awkwardness
had
made
the
earl
continued
to
read
i
could
almost
worship
her
independence
for
i
know
the
wishes
of
both
her
parents
were
for
my
success
i
confess
to
you
freely
that
my
vanity
has
been
a
good
deal
hurt
as
i
really
thought
myself
agreeable
to
her
she
certainly
listened
to
my
conversation
and
admitted
my
approaches
with
more
satisfaction
than
those
of
any
other
of
the
men
around
her
and
when
i
ventured
to
hint
to
her
this
circumstance
as
some
justification
for
my
presumption
she
frankly
acknowledged
the
truth
of
my
impression
and
without
explaining
the
reasons
for
her
conduct
deeply
regretted
the
construction
i
had
been
led
to
place
upon
the
circumstance
yes
my
lord
i
felt
it
necessary
to
apologize
to
emily
moseley
for
presuming
to
aspire
to
the
honor
of
possessing
so
much
loveliness
and
virtue
the
accidental
advantages
of
rank
and
wealth
lose
all
their
importance
when
opposed
to
her
delicacy
ingenuousness
and
unaffected
principles
i
have
heard
it
intimated
lately
that
george
denbigh
was
in
some
way
or
other
instrumental
in
saving
her
life
once
and
that
to
her
gratitude
and
to
my
resemblance
to
the
colonel
am
i
indebted
to
a
consideration
with
miss
moseley
which
although
it
has
been
the
means
of
buoying
me
up
with
false
hopes
i
can
never
regret
from
the
pleasure
her
society
has
afforded
me
i
have
remarked
on
my
mentioning
his
name
to
her
that
she
showed
unusual
emotion
and
as
denbigh
is
already
a
husband
and
myself
rejected
the
field
is
now
fairly
open
to
you
you
will
enter
on
your
enterprise
with
great
advantage
as
you
have
the
same
flattering
resemblance
and
if
anything
the
voice
which
i
am
told
is
our
greatest
recommendation
with
the
ladies
in
higher
perfection
than
either
george
or
your
humble
servant
here
the
reader
stopped
of
his
own
accord
and
was
so
intently
absorbed
in
his
meditations
that
the
almost
breathless
curiosity
of
his
sister
was
obliged
to
find
relief
by
desiring
him
to
proceed
roused
by
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
earl
changed
color
sensibly
and
continued
but
to
be
serious
on
a
subject
of
great
importance
to
my
future
life
for
i
sometimes
think
her
negative
will
make
denbigh
a
duke
the
lovely
girl
did
not
appear
happy
at
the
time
of
our
interview
nor
do
i
think
she
enjoys
at
any
time
the
spirits
nature
has
evidently
given
her
harriet
is
nearly
as
great
an
admirer
of
miss
moseley
and
takes
her
refusal
to
heart
as
much
as
myself
she
even
attempted
to
intercede
with
her
in
my
behalf
but
the
charming
girl
though
mild
grateful
and
delicate
was
firm
and
unequivocal
and
left
no
grounds
for
the
remotest
expectation
of
success
from
perseverance
on
my
part
as
harriet
had
received
an
intimation
that
both
miss
moseley
and
her
aunt
entertained
extremely
rigid
notions
on
the
score
of
religion
she
took
occasion
to
introduce
the
subject
in
her
conference
with
the
former
and
was
told
in
reply
other
considerations
would
have
determined
her
to
decline
the
honor
i
intended
her
but
that
under
any
circumstances
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
my
principles
would
be
necessary
before
she
could
entertain
a
thought
of
accepting
my
hand
or
indeed
that
of
any
other
man
think
of
that
pendennyss
the
principles
of
a
duke
now
a
dukedom
and
forty
thousand
a
year
would
furnish
a
character
with
most
people
for
a
nero
i
trust
the
important
object
i
have
had
in
view
here
is
a
sufficient
excuse
for
my
breach
of
promise
to
you
and
i
am
serious
when
i
wish
you
unless
the
pretty
spaniard
has
as
i
sometimes
suspect
made
you
a
captive
to
see
and
endeavor
to
bring
me
in
some
degree
connected
with
the
charming
family
of
sir
edward
moseley
the
aunt
wilson
often
speaks
of
you
with
the
greatest
interest
and
from
some
cause
or
other
is
strongly
enlisted
in
your
favor
and
miss
moseley
hears
your
name
mentioned
with
evident
pleasure
your
religion
or
principles
can
not
be
doubted
you
can
offer
larger
settlements
as
honorable
if
not
as
elevated
a
title
a
far
more
illustrious
name
purchased
by
your
own
services
and
personal
merit
greatly
exceeding
the
pretensions
of
your
assured
friend
and
relative
derwent
both
brother
and
sister
were
occupied
with
their
own
reflections
for
several
minutes
after
the
letter
was
ended
and
the
silence
was
broken
first
by
the
latter
saying
with
a
low
tone
to
her
brother
you
must
endeavor
to
become
acquainted
with
wilson
she
is
i
know
very
anxious
to
see
you
and
your
friendship
for
the
general
requires
it
of
you
i
owe
general
wilson
much
replied
the
brother
in
a
melancholy
voice
and
when
we
go
to
annerdale
house
i
wish
you
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
ladies
of
the
moseley
family
should
they
be
in
town
this
winter
but
you
have
yet
the
letter
of
harriet
to
read
after
first
hastily
running
over
its
contents
the
lady
commenced
the
fulfilment
of
her
part
of
the
engagement
frederick
has
been
so
much
engrossed
of
late
with
his
own
affairs
that
he
has
forgotten
there
is
such
a
creature
in
existence
as
his
sister
or
indeed
any
one
else
but
a
miss
emily
moseley
and
consequently
i
have
been
unable
to
fulfil
my
promise
of
making
you
a
visit
for
want
of
a
proper
escort
and
and
perhaps
some
other
considerations
not
worth
mentioning
in
a
letter
i
know
you
will
read
to
the
earl
yes
my
dear
cousin
frederick
denbigh
has
supplicated
the
daughter
of
a
country
baronet
to
become
a
duchess
and
hear
it
ye
nymphs
and
dames
has
supplicated
in
vain
i
confess
to
you
when
the
thing
was
first
in
agitation
my
aristocratic
blood
roused
itself
a
little
at
the
anticipated
connexion
but
finding
on
examination
that
sir
edward
was
of
no
doubtful
lineage
and
that
the
blood
of
the
chattertons
runs
in
his
veins
and
finding
the
young
lady
everything
i
could
wish
in
a
sister
my
scruples
soon
disappeared
with
the
folly
that
engendered
them
there
was
no
necessity
for
any
alarm
for
the
lady
very
decidedly
refused
the
honor
offered
her
by
derwent
and
what
makes
the
matter
worse
refused
the
solicitations
of
his
sister
also
i
have
fifty
times
been
surprised
at
my
own
condescension
and
to
this
moment
am
at
a
loss
to
know
whether
it
was
to
the
lady
worth
my
brother
happiness
or
the
chatterton
blood
that
i
finally
yielded
heigho
this
chatterton
is
certainly
much
too
handsome
for
a
man
but
i
forget
you
have
never
seen
him
here
an
arch
smile
stole
over
the
features
of
the
listener
as
his
sister
continued
to
return
to
my
narration
i
had
half
a
mind
to
send
for
a
miss
harris
there
is
here
to
learn
the
most
approved
fashion
of
a
lady
preferring
a
suit
but
as
fame
said
she
was
just
now
practising
on
a
certain
hero
ycleped
captain
jarvis
heir
to
sir
timo
of
that
name
it
struck
me
her
system
might
be
rather
too
abrupt
so
i
was
fain
to
adopt
the
best
plan
that
of
trusting
to
nature
and
my
own
feelings
for
words
nobility
is
certainly
a
very
pretty
thing
for
those
who
have
it
but
i
would
defy
the
old
margravine
of
to
keep
up
the
semblance
of
superiority
with
emily
moseley
she
is
so
very
natural
so
very
beautiful
and
withal
at
times
a
little
arch
that
one
is
afraid
to
set
up
any
other
distinctions
than
such
as
can
be
fairly
supported
i
commenced
with
hoping
her
determination
to
reject
the
hand
of
frederick
was
not
an
unalterable
one
yes
i
called
him
frederick
what
i
never
did
out
of
my
own
family
before
in
my
life
there
was
a
considerable
tremor
in
the
voice
of
miss
moseley
as
she
replied
now
perceive
when
too
late
that
my
indiscretion
has
given
reason
to
my
friends
to
think
that
i
have
entertained
intentions
towards
his
grace
of
which
i
entreat
you
to
believe
me
lady
harriet
i
am
innocent
indeed
indeed
as
anything
more
than
an
agreeable
acquaintance
i
have
never
allowed
myself
to
think
of
your
brother
and
from
my
soul
i
believe
her
we
continued
our
conversation
for
half
an
hour
longer
and
such
was
the
ingenuousness
delicacy
and
high
religious
feeling
displayed
by
the
charming
girl
that
if
i
entered
the
room
with
a
spark
of
regret
that
i
was
compelled
to
solicit
another
to
favor
my
love
i
left
it
with
a
feeling
that
my
efforts
had
been
unsuccessful
yes
thou
peerless
sister
of
the
more
peerless
pendennyss
i
once
thought
of
your
ladyship
as
a
wife
for
derwent
a
glass
of
water
was
necessary
to
enable
the
reader
to
clear
her
voice
which
grew
husky
from
speaking
so
long
but
i
now
openly
avow
neither
your
birth
your
hundred
thousand
pounds
nor
your
merit
would
put
you
on
a
footing
in
my
estimation
with
my
emily
you
may
form
some
idea
of
her
power
to
captivate
and
of
her
indifference
to
her
conquests
when
i
mention
that
she
once
i
forget
you
do
know
him
and
therefore
can
not
be
a
judge
the
thing
is
finally
decided
and
we
shortly
go
into
westmoreland
and
next
week
the
moseleys
return
to
northamptonshire
i
do
know
when
i
shall
be
able
to
visit
you
and
think
i
may
now
safely
invite
you
to
denbigh
castle
although
a
month
ago
i
might
have
hesitated
love
to
the
earl
and
kind
assurance
to
yourself
of
unalterable
regard
harriet
denbigh
i
believe
i
forgot
to
mention
that
moseley
a
sister
of
lord
chatterton
has
gone
to
portugal
and
that
the
peer
himself
is
to
go
into
the
country
with
us
there
is
i
suppose
a
between
them
just
now
though
i
do
not
think
chatterton
looks
so
very
miserable
as
he
might
adieu
on
ending
this
second
epistle
the
same
silence
which
had
succeeded
the
reading
of
the
first
prevailed
until
the
lady
with
an
arch
expression
interrupted
it
by
saying
harriet
will
i
think
soon
grace
the
peerage
and
happily
i
trust
replied
the
brother
do
you
know
lord
chatterton
i
do
he
is
very
amiable
and
admirably
calculated
to
contrast
with
the
lively
gaiety
of
harriet
denbigh
you
believe
in
loving
our
opposites
i
see
rejoined
the
lady
and
then
affectionately
stretching
out
her
hand
to
him
she
added
but
pendennyss
you
must
give
me
for
a
sister
one
as
nearly
like
yourself
as
possible
that
might
please
your
affections
answered
the
earl
with
a
smile
but
how
would
it
comport
with
my
tastes
will
you
suffer
me
to
describe
the
kind
of
man
you
are
to
select
for
your
future
lord
unless
indeed
you
have
decided
the
point
already
the
lady
colored
violently
and
appearing
anxious
to
change
the
subject
she
tumbled
over
two
or
three
unopened
letters
as
she
cried
eagerly
here
is
one
from
the
donna
julia
the
earl
instantly
broke
the
seal
and
read
aloud
no
secrets
existing
between
them
in
relation
to
their
mutual
friend
my
lord
i
hasten
to
write
you
what
i
know
it
will
give
you
pleasure
to
hear
concerning
my
future
prospects
in
life
my
uncle
general
has
written
me
the
cheerful
tidings
that
my
father
has
consented
to
receive
his
only
child
without
any
other
sacrifice
than
a
condition
of
attending
the
service
of
the
catholic
church
without
any
professions
on
my
side
or
even
an
understanding
that
i
am
conforming
to
its
peculiar
tenets
this
may
be
in
some
measure
irksome
at
times
and
possibly
distressing
but
the
worship
of
god
with
a
proper
humiliation
of
spirit
i
have
learnt
to
consider
as
a
privilege
to
us
here
and
i
owe
a
duty
to
my
earthly
father
of
penitence
and
care
in
his
later
years
that
will
justify
the
measure
in
the
eyes
of
my
heavenly
one
i
have
therefore
acquainted
my
uncle
in
reply
that
i
am
willing
to
attend
the
summons
at
any
moment
he
will
choose
to
make
them
and
i
thought
it
a
debt
due
your
care
and
friendship
to
apprise
your
lordship
of
my
approaching
departure
from
this
country
indeed
i
have
great
reasons
for
believing
that
your
kind
and
unremitted
efforts
to
attain
this
object
have
already
prepared
you
to
expect
this
result
i
feel
it
will
be
impossible
to
quit
england
without
seeing
you
and
your
sister
to
thank
you
for
the
many
very
many
favors
of
both
a
temporal
and
eternal
nature
you
have
been
the
agents
of
conferring
on
me
the
cruel
suggestions
which
i
dreaded
and
which
it
appears
had
reached
the
ears
of
my
friends
in
spain
have
prevented
my
troubling
your
lordship
of
late
unnecessarily
with
my
concerns
the
consideration
of
a
friend
to
your
character
wilson
has
removed
the
necessity
of
applying
for
your
advice
she
and
her
charming
niece
miss
emily
moseley
have
been
next
to
yourselves
the
greatest
solace
i
have
had
in
my
exile
and
united
you
will
be
remembered
in
my
prayers
i
will
merely
mention
here
deferring
the
explanation
until
i
see
you
in
london
that
i
have
been
visited
by
the
wretch
from
whom
you
delivered
me
in
portugal
and
that
the
means
of
ascertaining
his
name
have
fallen
into
my
hands
you
will
be
the
best
judge
of
the
proper
steps
to
be
taken
but
i
wish
by
all
means
something
may
be
done
to
prevent
his
attempting
to
see
me
in
spain
should
it
be
discovered
to
my
relations
there
that
he
has
any
such
intentions
it
would
certainly
terminate
in
his
death
and
possibly
in
my
disgrace
wishing
you
and
your
kind
sister
all
possible
happiness
i
remain
your
lordship
obliged
friend
julia
fitzgerald
oh
cried
the
sister
as
she
concluded
the
letter
we
must
certainly
see
her
before
she
goes
what
a
wretch
that
persecutor
of
hers
must
be
how
persevering
in
his
villainy
he
does
exceed
my
ideas
of
effrontery
said
the
earl
in
great
but
he
may
offend
too
far
the
laws
shall
interpose
their
power
to
defeat
his
schemes
should
he
ever
repeat
them
he
attempted
to
take
your
life
brother
said
the
lady
shuddering
if
i
remember
the
tale
aright
why
i
have
endeavored
to
free
him
from
that
imputation
rejoined
the
brother
musing
he
certainly
fired
a
pistol
but
the
latter
hit
my
horse
at
such
a
distance
from
myself
that
i
believe
his
object
was
to
disable
me
and
not
murder
his
escape
has
astonished
me
he
must
have
fled
by
himself
into
the
woods
as
harmer
was
but
a
short
distance
behind
me
admirably
mounted
and
the
escort
was
up
and
in
full
pursuit
within
ten
minutes
after
all
it
may
be
for
the
best
he
was
not
taken
for
i
am
persuaded
the
dragoons
would
have
sabred
him
on
the
spot
and
he
may
have
parents
of
respectability
or
a
wife
to
kill
by
the
knowledge
of
his
misconduct
this
emily
moseley
must
be
a
faultless
being
cried
the
sister
as
she
ran
over
the
contents
of
julia
letter
three
different
letters
and
each
containing
her
praises
the
earl
made
no
reply
but
opening
the
duke
letter
again
he
appeared
to
be
studying
its
contents
his
color
slightly
changed
as
he
dwelt
on
its
passages
and
turning
to
his
sister
he
inquired
if
she
had
a
mind
to
try
the
air
of
westmoreland
for
a
couple
of
weeks
or
a
month
as
you
say
my
lord
replied
the
lady
with
cheeks
of
scarlet
then
i
say
we
will
go
i
wish
much
to
see
derwent
and
i
think
there
will
be
a
wedding
during
our
visit
he
rang
the
bell
and
the
almost
untasted
breakfast
was
removed
in
a
few
minutes
a
servant
announced
that
his
horse
was
in
readiness
the
earl
wished
his
sister
a
friendly
good
morning
and
proceeded
to
the
door
where
was
standing
one
of
the
noble
black
horses
before
mentioned
held
by
a
groom
and
the
attendant
ready
mounted
on
another
throwing
himself
into
the
saddle
the
young
peer
rode
gracefully
from
the
door
followed
by
his
attendant
horseman
during
this
ride
the
master
suffered
his
steed
to
take
whatever
course
most
pleased
himself
and
his
follower
looked
up
in
surprise
more
than
once
to
see
the
careless
manner
in
which
the
earl
of
pendennyss
confessedly
one
of
the
best
horsemen
in
england
managed
the
noble
animal
having
however
got
without
the
gates
of
his
own
park
and
into
the
vicinity
of
numberless
cottages
and
the
master
recovered
his
recollection
and
the
man
ceased
to
wonder
for
three
hours
the
equestrians
pursued
their
course
through
the
beautiful
vale
which
opened
gracefully
opposite
one
of
the
fronts
of
the
castle
and
if
faces
of
smiling
welcome
inquiries
after
his
own
and
his
sister
welfare
which
evidently
sprang
from
the
heart
or
the
most
familiar
but
respectful
representations
of
their
own
prosperity
or
misfortunes
gave
any
testimony
of
the
feelings
entertained
by
the
tenantry
of
this
noble
estate
for
their
landlord
the
situation
of
the
young
nobleman
might
be
justly
considered
envied
as
the
hour
for
dinner
approached
they
turned
the
heads
of
their
horses
towards
home
and
on
entering
the
park
removed
from
the
scene
of
industry
and
activity
without
the
earl
relapsed
into
his
fit
of
musing
a
short
distance
from
the
house
he
suddenly
called
harmer
the
man
drove
his
spurs
into
the
loins
of
his
horse
and
in
an
instant
was
by
the
side
of
his
master
which
he
signified
by
raising
his
hand
to
his
cap
with
the
palm
opening
outward
you
must
prepare
to
go
to
spain
when
required
in
attendance
on
mrs
fitzgerald
the
man
received
his
order
with
the
indifference
of
one
used
to
adventures
and
movements
and
having
laconically
dignified
his
assent
he
drew
his
horse
back
again
into
his
station
in
the
rear
chapter
xxxviii
the
day
succeeding
the
arrival
of
the
moseleys
at
the
seat
of
their
ancestors
wilson
observed
emily
silently
putting
on
her
pelisse
and
walking
out
unattended
by
either
of
the
domestics
or
any
of
the
family
there
was
a
peculiar
melancholy
in
her
air
and
manner
which
inclined
the
cautious
aunt
to
suspect
that
her
charge
was
bent
on
the
indulgence
of
some
weakness
more
particularly
as
the
direction
she
took
led
to
the
arbor
a
theatre
in
which
denbigh
had
been
so
conspicuous
an
actor
hastily
throwing
a
cloak
over
her
own
shoulders
wilson
followed
emily
with
the
double
purpose
of
ascertaining
her
views
and
if
necessary
of
interposing
her
own
authority
against
the
repetition
of
similar
excursions
as
emily
approached
the
arbor
whither
in
truth
she
had
directed
her
steps
its
faded
vegetation
and
chilling
aspect
so
different
from
its
verdure
and
luxuriance
when
she
last
saw
it
came
over
her
heart
as
a
symbol
of
her
own
blighted
prospects
and
deadened
affections
the
recollection
of
denbigh
conduct
on
that
spot
of
his
general
benevolence
and
assiduity
to
please
being
forcibly
recalled
to
her
mind
at
the
instant
forgetful
of
her
object
in
visiting
the
arbor
emily
yielded
to
her
sensibilities
and
sank
on
the
seat
weeping
as
if
her
heart
would
break
she
had
not
time
to
dry
her
eyes
and
to
collect
her
scattered
thoughts
before
wilson
entered
the
arbor
eyeing
her
niece
for
a
moment
with
a
sternness
unusual
for
the
one
to
adopt
or
the
other
to
receive
she
said
it
is
a
solemn
obligation
we
owe
our
religion
and
ourselves
to
endeavor
to
suppress
such
passions
as
are
incompatible
with
our
duties
and
there
is
no
weakness
greater
than
blindly
adhering
to
the
wrong
when
we
are
convinced
of
our
error
it
is
as
fatal
to
good
morals
as
it
is
unjust
to
ourselves
to
persevere
from
selfish
motives
in
believing
those
innocent
whom
evidence
has
convicted
as
guilty
many
a
weak
woman
has
sealed
her
own
misery
by
such
wilful
obstinacy
aided
by
the
unpardonable
vanity
of
believing
herself
able
to
control
a
man
that
the
laws
of
god
could
not
restrain
oh
dear
madam
speak
not
so
unkindly
to
me
sobbed
the
weeping
girl
i
i
am
guilty
of
no
such
weakness
i
assure
you
and
looking
up
with
an
air
of
profound
resignation
and
piety
she
continued
here
on
this
spot
where
he
saved
my
life
i
was
about
to
offer
up
my
prayers
for
his
conviction
of
the
error
of
his
ways
and
for
the
pardon
of
his
too
too
heavy
transgressions
wilson
softened
almost
to
tears
herself
viewed
her
for
a
moment
with
a
mixture
of
delight
and
continued
in
a
milder
tone
i
believe
you
my
dear
i
am
certain
although
you
may
have
loved
denbigh
much
that
you
love
your
maker
and
his
ordinances
more
and
i
have
no
apprehensions
that
were
he
a
disengaged
man
and
you
alone
in
the
world
unsupported
by
anything
but
your
sense
of
duty
you
would
ever
so
far
forget
yourself
as
to
become
his
wife
but
does
not
your
religion
does
not
your
own
usefulness
in
society
require
you
wholly
to
free
your
heart
from
the
power
of
a
man
who
has
so
unworthily
usurped
a
dominion
over
it
to
this
emily
replied
in
a
hardly
audible
voice
certainly
and
i
pray
constantly
for
it
it
is
well
my
love
said
the
aunt
soothingly
you
can
not
fail
with
such
means
and
your
own
exertions
finally
to
prevail
over
your
own
worst
enemies
your
passions
the
task
our
sex
has
to
sustain
is
at
the
best
an
arduous
one
but
so
much
the
greater
is
our
credit
if
we
do
it
well
oh
how
is
an
unguided
girl
ever
to
judge
aright
if
cried
emily
clasping
her
hands
and
speaking
with
great
energy
and
she
would
have
said
one
like
denbigh
in
appearance
be
so
vile
shame
however
kept
her
silent
few
men
can
support
such
a
veil
of
hypocrisy
as
that
with
which
i
sometimes
think
denbigh
must
deceive
even
himself
his
case
is
an
extraordinary
exception
to
a
very
sacred
rule
the
tree
is
known
by
its
fruits
replied
her
aunt
there
is
no
safer
way
of
judging
of
character
that
one
opportunities
will
not
admit
of
more
closely
investigating
than
by
examining
into
and
duly
appreciating
early
impressions
the
man
or
woman
who
has
constantly
seen
the
practice
of
piety
before
them
from
infancy
to
the
noon
of
life
will
seldom
so
far
abandon
the
recollection
of
virtue
as
to
be
guilty
of
great
enormities
even
divine
truth
has
promised
that
his
blessings
or
his
curses
shall
extend
to
many
generations
it
is
true
that
with
our
most
most
guarded
prudence
we
may
be
deceived
wilson
paused
and
sighed
heavily
as
her
own
case
connected
with
the
loves
of
denbigh
and
her
niece
occurred
strongly
to
her
mind
yet
she
continued
we
may
lessen
the
danger
much
by
guarding
against
it
and
it
seems
to
me
no
more
than
what
requires
in
a
young
woman
but
for
a
religious
parent
to
neglect
it
is
a
wilful
abandonment
of
a
most
solemn
duty
as
wilson
concluded
her
niece
who
had
recovered
the
command
of
her
feelings
pressed
her
hand
in
silence
to
her
lips
and
showed
a
disposition
to
retire
from
a
spot
which
she
found
recalled
too
many
recollections
of
a
man
whose
image
it
was
her
imperious
duty
to
banish
on
every
consideration
of
propriety
and
religion
their
walk
into
the
house
was
silent
and
their
thoughts
were
drawn
from
the
unpleasant
topic
by
finding
a
letter
from
julia
announcing
her
intended
departure
from
this
country
and
her
wish
to
take
leave
of
them
in
london
before
she
sailed
as
she
had
mentioned
the
probable
day
for
that
event
both
the
ladies
were
delighted
to
find
it
was
posterior
to
the
time
fixed
by
sir
edward
for
their
own
visit
to
the
capital
had
jane
instead
of
emily
been
the
one
that
suffered
through
the
agency
of
fitzgerald
however
innocently
on
the
part
of
the
lady
her
violent
and
uncontrolled
passions
would
have
either
blindly
united
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
in
her
resentments
or
if
a
sense
of
justice
had
vindicated
the
lady
in
her
judgment
yet
her
pride
and
guided
delicacy
would
have
felt
her
name
a
reproach
that
would
have
forbidden
any
intercourse
with
her
or
any
belonging
to
her
not
so
with
her
sister
the
sufferings
of
fitzgerald
had
taken
a
strong
hold
on
her
youthful
feelings
and
a
similarity
of
opinions
and
practices
on
the
great
object
of
their
lives
had
brought
them
together
in
a
manner
no
misconduct
in
a
third
person
could
weaken
it
is
true
the
recollection
of
denbigh
was
intimately
blended
with
the
fate
of
fitzgerald
but
emily
sought
support
against
her
feeling
from
a
quarter
that
rather
required
an
investigation
of
them
than
a
desire
to
drown
care
with
thought
she
never
indulged
in
romantic
reflections
in
which
the
image
of
denbigh
was
associated
this
she
had
hardly
done
in
her
happiest
moments
and
his
marriage
if
nothing
else
had
interfered
now
absolutely
put
it
out
of
the
question
but
although
a
christian
and
an
humble
and
devout
one
emily
moseley
was
a
woman
and
had
loved
ardently
confidingly
and
gratefully
marriage
is
the
business
of
life
with
her
sex
with
all
next
to
a
preparation
for
a
better
world
and
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
a
first
passion
in
a
bosom
like
that
of
our
heroine
was
to
be
suddenly
erased
and
to
leave
no
vestiges
of
its
existence
her
partiality
for
the
society
of
derwent
her
meditations
in
which
she
sometimes
detected
herself
drawing
a
picture
of
what
denbigh
might
have
been
if
early
care
had
been
taken
to
impress
him
with
his
situation
in
this
world
and
from
which
she
generally
retired
to
her
closet
and
her
knees
were
the
remains
of
feelings
too
strong
and
too
pure
to
be
torn
from
her
in
a
moment
the
arrival
of
john
with
grace
and
jane
enlivened
not
only
the
family
but
the
neighborhood
haughton
and
his
numerous
friends
poured
in
on
the
young
couple
with
their
congratulations
and
a
few
weeks
stole
by
insensibly
previously
to
the
commencement
of
the
journeys
of
sir
edward
and
his
son
the
one
to
benfield
lodge
and
the
other
to
square
on
the
return
of
the
travellers
a
few
days
before
they
commenced
their
journey
to
the
capital
john
laughingly
told
his
uncle
that
although
he
himself
greatly
admired
the
taste
of
peter
johnson
in
dress
yet
he
doubted
whether
the
present
style
of
fashions
in
the
metropolis
would
not
be
scandalized
by
the
appearance
of
the
honest
steward
john
had
in
fact
noticed
in
their
former
visit
to
london
mob
of
mischievous
boys
eyeing
peter
with
indications
of
rebellious
movements
which
threatened
the
old
man
and
from
which
he
had
retreated
by
taking
a
coach
and
he
now
made
the
suggestion
from
pure
to
save
him
any
future
trouble
from
a
similar
cause
they
were
at
dinner
when
moseley
made
the
remark
and
the
steward
was
in
his
place
at
the
sideboard
for
his
master
was
his
home
drawing
near
at
the
mention
of
his
name
first
and
casting
an
eye
over
his
figure
to
see
if
all
was
decent
peter
respectfully
broke
silence
determined
to
defend
his
own
cause
why
john
john
moseley
if
i
might
judge
for
an
elderly
man
and
a
serving
man
said
the
steward
bowing
humbly
i
am
no
disparagement
to
my
friends
or
even
to
my
honored
master
johnson
vindication
of
his
wardrobe
drew
the
eyes
of
the
family
upon
him
and
an
involuntary
smile
passed
from
one
to
the
other
as
they
admired
his
starched
figure
and
drab
frock
or
rather
doublet
with
sleeves
and
skirts
sir
edward
being
of
the
same
opinion
with
his
son
observed
i
do
think
uncle
benfield
there
might
be
an
improvement
in
the
dress
of
your
steward
without
much
trouble
to
the
ingenuity
of
his
tailor
sir
edward
moseley
honorable
sir
said
the
steward
beginning
to
grow
alarmed
if
i
may
be
so
bold
you
young
gentlemen
may
like
gay
clothes
but
as
for
me
and
his
honor
we
are
used
to
such
as
we
wear
and
what
we
are
used
to
we
love
the
old
man
spoke
with
earnestness
and
drew
the
particular
attention
of
his
master
to
a
review
of
his
attire
after
reflecting
that
no
gentleman
in
the
house
had
been
attended
by
any
servitor
in
such
a
garb
benfield
thought
it
time
to
give
his
sentiments
on
the
subject
why
i
remember
that
my
lord
gosford
gentleman
never
wore
a
livery
nor
can
i
say
that
he
dressed
exactly
after
the
manner
of
johnson
every
member
had
his
body
servant
and
they
were
not
unfrequently
taken
for
their
masters
lady
juliana
too
after
the
death
of
her
nephew
had
one
or
two
attendants
out
of
livery
and
in
a
different
fashion
from
your
attire
peter
i
think
with
john
moseley
there
we
must
alter
you
a
little
for
the
sake
of
appearances
your
honor
stammered
out
peter
in
increased
terror
for
john
moseley
and
sir
edward
and
youngerly
gentlemen
like
dress
may
do
now
your
honor
if
and
peter
turning
to
grace
bowed
nearly
to
the
floor
i
had
such
a
sweet
most
beautiful
young
lady
to
smile
on
me
i
might
wish
to
change
but
sir
my
day
has
gone
by
peter
sighed
as
the
recollection
of
patty
steele
and
his
youthful
love
floated
across
his
brain
grace
blushed
and
thanked
him
for
the
compliment
and
gave
her
opinion
that
his
gallantry
merited
a
better
costume
peter
said
his
master
decidedly
i
think
moseley
is
right
if
i
should
call
on
the
viscountess
the
lady
juliana
who
yet
survived
an
ancient
dowager
of
seventy
i
shall
want
your
attendance
and
in
your
present
garb
you
can
not
fail
to
shock
her
delicate
feelings
you
remind
me
now
i
think
every
time
i
look
at
you
of
old
harry
the
gamekeeper
one
of
the
most
cruel
men
i
ever
knew
this
decided
the
matter
peter
well
knew
that
his
master
antipathy
to
old
harry
arose
from
his
having
pursued
a
poacher
one
day
in
place
of
helping
the
lady
juliana
over
a
stile
in
her
flight
from
a
bull
that
was
playing
his
gambols
in
the
same
field
and
not
for
the
world
would
the
faithful
steward
retain
even
a
feature
if
it
brought
unpleasant
recollections
to
his
kind
master
he
at
one
time
thought
of
closing
his
innovations
on
his
wardrobe
however
with
a
change
of
his
nether
garment
as
after
a
great
deal
of
study
he
could
only
make
out
the
resemblance
between
himself
and
the
obnoxious
gamekeeper
to
consist
in
the
leathern
breeches
but
fearful
of
some
points
escaping
his
memory
in
forty
years
he
tamely
acquiesced
in
all
john
alterations
and
appeared
at
his
station
three
days
afterwards
newly
decked
from
head
to
foot
in
a
more
modern
suit
of
the
change
once
made
peter
greatly
admired
himself
in
a
glass
and
thought
could
he
have
had
the
taste
of
john
moseley
in
his
youth
to
direct
his
toilet
that
the
hard
heart
of
patty
steele
would
not
always
have
continued
so
obdurate
sir
edward
wished
to
collect
his
neighbors
round
him
once
more
before
he
left
them
for
another
four
months
and
accordingly
the
rector
and
his
wife
francis
and
clara
the
haughtons
with
a
few
others
dined
at
the
hall
by
invitation
the
last
day
of
their
stay
in
northamptonshire
the
company
had
left
the
table
to
join
the
ladies
when
grace
came
into
the
with
a
face
covered
with
smiles
and
beaming
with
pleasure
you
look
like
the
bearer
of
good
news
moseley
cried
the
rector
catching
a
glimpse
of
her
countenance
as
she
passed
good
i
sincerely
hope
and
believe
replied
grace
my
letters
from
my
brother
announce
that
his
marriage
took
place
last
week
and
give
us
hopes
of
seeing
them
all
in
town
within
the
month
married
exclaimed
haughton
casting
his
eyes
unconsciously
on
emily
my
lord
chatterton
married
may
i
ask
the
name
of
the
bride
my
dear
mrs
moseley
to
lady
harriet
denbigh
and
at
denbigh
castle
in
westmoreland
but
very
privately
as
you
may
suppose
from
seeing
moseley
and
myself
here
answered
grace
her
cheeks
yet
glowing
with
surprise
and
pleasure
at
the
intelligence
lady
harriet
denbigh
echoed
haughton
what
a
kinswoman
of
our
old
friend
your
friend
miss
emily
the
recollection
of
the
service
he
had
performed
at
the
arbor
in
his
memory
emily
commanded
herself
sufficiently
to
reply
brothers
children
i
believe
sir
but
a
lady
how
came
she
my
lady
continued
the
good
man
anxious
to
know
the
whole
and
ignorant
of
any
reasons
for
delicacy
where
so
great
a
favorite
as
denbigh
was
in
the
question
she
is
the
daughter
of
the
late
duke
of
derwent
said
moseley
as
willing
as
himself
to
talk
of
her
new
sister
how
happens
it
that
the
death
of
old
denbigh
was
announced
as
plain
geo
denbigh
if
he
was
the
brother
of
a
duke
said
jane
forgetting
for
a
moment
the
presence
of
and
ives
in
her
surviving
passion
for
genealogy
should
he
not
have
been
called
lord
george
or
honorable
this
was
the
first
time
any
allusion
had
been
made
to
the
sudden
death
in
the
church
by
any
of
the
moseleys
in
the
hearing
of
the
family
and
the
speaker
sat
in
breathless
terror
at
her
own
inadvertency
but
ives
observing
that
a
profound
silence
prevailed
as
soon
as
jane
ended
answered
mildly
though
in
a
way
to
prevent
any
further
comments
the
late
duke
succeeding
a
in
the
title
was
the
reason
i
presume
emily
i
am
to
hear
from
you
by
letter
i
hope
after
you
enter
into
the
gaieties
of
the
metropolis
this
emily
cheerfully
promised
and
the
conversation
took
another
turn
wilson
had
carefully
avoided
all
communications
with
the
rector
concerning
his
youthful
friend
and
the
doctor
appeared
unwilling
to
commence
anything
which
might
lead
to
his
name
being
mentioned
he
is
disappointed
in
him
as
well
as
ourselves
thought
the
widow
and
it
must
be
unpleasant
to
have
his
image
recalled
he
saw
his
attentions
to
emily
and
he
knows
of
his
marriage
to
lady
laura
of
course
and
he
loves
us
all
and
emily
in
particular
too
well
not
to
feel
hurt
by
his
conduct
sir
edward
cried
haughton
with
a
laugh
baronets
are
likely
to
be
plenty
have
you
heard
how
near
we
were
to
have
another
in
the
neighborhood
lately
sir
edward
answered
in
the
negative
and
his
neighbor
continued
why
no
less
a
man
than
captain
jarvis
promoted
to
the
bloody
hand
captain
jarvis
exclaimed
five
or
six
at
once
explain
yourself
mr
haughton
my
near
neighbor
young
walker
has
been
to
bath
on
an
unusual
business
his
health
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
country
he
has
brought
back
a
pretty
piece
of
scandal
it
seems
that
lady
jarvis
as
i
am
told
she
is
since
she
left
here
wished
to
have
her
hopeful
heir
made
a
lord
and
that
the
two
united
for
some
six
months
in
forming
a
kind
of
savings
bank
between
themselves
to
enable
them
at
some
future
day
to
bribe
the
minister
to
honor
the
peerage
with
such
a
prodigy
after
awhile
the
daughter
of
our
late
acquaintance
sir
william
harris
became
an
accessory
to
the
plot
and
a
contributor
too
to
the
tune
of
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
some
circumstances
however
at
length
made
this
latter
lady
suspicious
and
she
wished
to
audit
the
books
the
captain
prevaricated
the
lady
remonstrated
until
the
gentleman
with
more
truth
than
manners
told
her
that
she
was
a
fool
the
money
he
had
expended
or
lost
at
dice
and
that
he
did
not
think
the
ministers
quite
so
silly
as
to
make
him
a
lord
or
that
he
himself
was
such
a
fool
as
to
make
her
his
wife
so
the
whole
thing
exploded
john
listened
with
a
delight
but
little
short
of
what
he
had
felt
when
grace
owned
her
love
and
anxious
to
know
all
eagerly
inquired
but
is
it
true
how
was
it
found
out
oh
the
lady
complained
of
part
and
the
captain
tells
all
to
get
the
laugh
on
his
side
so
that
walker
says
the
former
is
the
derision
and
the
latter
the
contempt
of
all
bath
poor
sir
william
said
the
baronet
with
feeling
he
is
much
to
be
pitied
i
am
afraid
he
has
nothing
to
blame
but
his
own
indulgence
remarked
the
rector
you
do
know
the
worst
of
it
replied
haughton
we
poor
people
are
made
to
suffer
lady
jarvis
wept
and
fretted
sir
timo
out
of
his
lease
which
has
been
given
up
and
a
new
house
is
to
be
taken
in
another
part
of
the
kingdom
where
neither
miss
harris
nor
the
story
is
known
then
sir
william
has
to
procure
a
new
tenant
said
lady
moseley
not
in
the
least
regretting
the
loss
of
the
old
one
no
my
lady
continued
haughton
with
a
smile
walker
is
you
know
an
attorney
and
does
some
business
occasionally
for
sir
william
when
jarvis
gave
up
the
lease
the
baronet
who
finds
himself
a
little
short
of
money
offered
the
deanery
for
sale
it
being
a
useless
place
to
him
and
the
very
next
day
while
walker
was
with
sir
william
a
gentleman
called
and
without
higgling
agreed
to
pay
down
at
once
his
thirty
thousand
pounds
for
it
and
who
is
the
purchaser
inquired
lady
moseley
eagerly
the
earl
of
pendennyss
lord
pendennyss
exclaimed
wilson
in
rapture
pendennyss
cried
the
rector
eyeing
the
aunt
and
emily
with
a
smile
pendennyss
echoed
all
in
the
room
in
amazement
yes
said
haughton
it
is
now
the
property
of
the
earl
who
says
he
has
bought
it
for
his
sister
chapter
xxxix
wilson
found
time
the
ensuing
day
to
ascertain
before
they
left
the
hall
the
truth
of
the
tale
related
by
haughton
the
deanery
had
certainly
changed
its
master
and
a
new
steward
had
already
arrived
to
take
possession
in
the
name
of
his
lord
what
induced
pendennyss
to
make
this
purchase
she
was
at
a
loss
to
conceive
most
probably
some
arrangement
between
himself
and
lord
bolton
but
whatever
might
be
his
motive
it
in
some
measure
insured
his
becoming
for
a
season
their
neighbor
and
wilson
felt
a
degree
of
pleasure
at
the
circumstance
that
she
had
been
a
stranger
to
for
a
long
time
a
pleasure
which
was
greatly
heightened
as
she
dwelt
on
the
lovely
face
of
the
companion
who
occupied
the
other
seat
in
her
travelling
chaise
the
road
to
london
led
by
the
gates
of
the
deanery
and
near
them
they
passed
a
servant
in
the
livery
of
those
they
had
once
seen
following
the
equipage
of
the
earl
anxious
to
know
anything
which
might
hasten
her
acquaintance
with
this
admired
nobleman
wilson
stopped
her
carriage
to
inquire
pray
sir
whom
do
you
serve
my
lord
pendennyss
replied
the
man
respectfully
taking
off
his
hat
the
earl
is
not
here
asked
wilson
with
interest
oh
no
madam
i
am
here
in
waiting
on
his
steward
my
lord
is
in
westmoreland
with
his
grace
and
colonel
denbigh
and
the
ladies
does
he
remain
there
long
continued
the
anxious
widow
desirous
of
knowing
all
she
could
learn
i
believe
not
madam
most
of
our
people
have
gone
to
and
my
lord
is
expected
in
town
with
the
duke
and
the
colonel
as
the
servant
was
an
elderly
man
and
appeared
to
understand
the
movements
of
his
master
so
well
wilson
was
put
in
unusual
spirits
by
this
prospect
of
a
speedy
termination
to
her
anxiety
to
meet
pendennyss
is
the
earl
town
residence
quietly
inquired
emily
yes
he
got
the
fortune
of
the
last
duke
of
that
title
but
how
i
do
not
exactly
know
i
believe
however
through
his
mother
general
wilson
did
not
know
his
family
indeed
pendennyss
bore
a
second
title
during
his
lifetime
but
did
you
observe
how
very
civil
his
servant
was
as
well
as
the
one
john
spoke
to
before
a
sure
sign
their
master
is
a
gentleman
emily
smiled
at
the
strong
partialities
of
her
aunt
and
replied
your
handsome
chaise
and
attendants
will
draw
respect
from
most
men
in
his
situation
dear
aunt
be
their
masters
who
they
may
the
expected
pleasure
of
meeting
the
earl
was
a
topic
frequently
touched
upon
between
her
aunt
and
emily
during
their
journey
the
former
beginning
to
entertain
hopes
she
would
have
laughed
at
herself
for
could
they
have
been
fairly
laid
before
her
and
the
latter
entertaining
a
profound
respect
for
his
character
but
chiefly
governed
by
a
wish
to
gratify
her
companion
the
third
day
they
reached
the
baronet
handsome
house
in
square
and
found
that
the
forethought
of
john
had
provided
everything
in
the
best
and
most
comfortable
manner
it
was
the
first
visit
of
both
jane
and
emily
to
the
metropolis
and
under
the
protection
of
their
almost
equally
curious
mother
and
escorted
by
john
they
wisely
determined
to
visit
the
curiosities
while
their
leisure
yet
admitted
of
the
opportunity
for
the
first
two
weeks
their
time
was
chiefly
employed
in
the
indulgence
of
this
unfashionable
and
vulgar
propensity
which
if
it
had
no
other
tendency
served
greatly
to
draw
the
thoughts
of
both
the
young
women
from
the
recollections
of
the
last
few
months
while
her
sister
and
nieces
were
thus
employed
wilson
assisted
by
grace
was
occupied
in
getting
things
in
preparation
to
do
credit
to
the
baronet
hospitality
the
second
week
after
their
arrival
moseley
was
delighted
by
seeing
advance
upon
her
unexpectedly
through
the
door
of
the
breakfast
parlor
her
brother
with
his
bride
leaning
on
his
arm
after
the
most
sincere
greetings
and
congratulations
lady
chatterton
cried
out
gaily
you
see
my
dear
lady
moseley
i
am
determined
to
banish
ceremony
between
us
and
so
instead
of
sending
you
my
card
have
come
myself
to
notify
you
of
my
arrival
chatterton
would
not
suffer
me
even
to
swallow
my
breakfast
he
was
so
impatient
to
show
me
off
you
are
placing
things
exactly
on
the
footing
i
wish
to
see
ourselves
with
all
our
connexions
replied
lady
moseley
kindly
but
what
have
you
done
with
the
duke
is
he
not
in
your
train
oh
he
is
gone
to
canterbury
with
george
denbigh
madam
cried
the
lady
shaking
her
head
reproachfully
though
affectionately
at
emily
his
grace
dislikes
london
just
now
excessively
he
says
and
the
colonel
being
obliged
to
leave
his
wife
on
regimental
business
derwent
was
good
enough
to
keep
him
company
during
his
exile
and
lady
laura
do
we
see
her
inquired
lady
moseley
she
came
with
us
pendennyss
and
his
sister
follow
immediately
so
my
dear
madam
the
dramatis
personæ
will
all
be
on
the
stage
soon
cards
and
visits
now
began
to
accumulate
on
the
moseleys
and
their
time
no
longer
admitted
of
that
unfettered
leisure
which
they
had
enjoyed
at
their
entrance
on
the
scene
wilson
for
herself
and
charge
adopted
a
rule
for
the
government
of
her
manner
of
living
which
was
consistent
with
her
duties
they
mixed
in
general
society
sparingly
and
above
all
they
rigidly
adhered
to
the
obedience
to
the
injunction
which
commanded
them
to
keep
the
sabbath
day
holy
a
duty
of
no
trifling
difficulty
to
perform
in
fashionable
society
in
the
city
of
london
or
indeed
in
any
other
place
where
the
influence
of
fashion
has
supplanted
the
laws
of
god
wilson
was
not
a
bigot
but
she
knew
and
performed
her
duty
rigidly
it
was
a
pleasure
to
her
to
do
so
it
would
have
been
misery
to
do
otherwise
in
the
singleness
of
heart
and
deep
piety
of
her
niece
she
had
a
willing
pupil
to
her
system
of
morals
and
a
rigid
follower
of
her
religious
practices
as
they
both
knew
that
the
temptations
to
go
astray
were
greater
in
town
than
in
country
they
kept
a
strict
guard
over
the
tendency
to
err
and
in
watchfulness
found
their
greatest
security
john
moseley
next
to
his
friends
loved
his
bays
indeed
if
the
aggregate
of
his
affections
for
these
and
lady
herriefield
had
been
put
in
opposite
scales
we
strongly
suspect
the
side
of
the
horses
would
predominate
one
sunday
soon
after
being
domesticated
john
who
had
soberly
attended
morning
service
with
the
ladies
came
into
a
little
room
where
the
more
reflecting
part
of
the
family
were
assembled
in
search
of
his
wife
grace
we
have
before
mentioned
had
become
a
real
member
of
that
church
in
which
she
had
been
educated
and
had
entered
under
the
direction
of
ives
and
wilson
into
an
observance
of
its
wholesome
ordinances
grace
was
certainly
piously
inclined
if
not
devout
her
feelings
on
the
subject
of
religion
had
been
sensibly
awakened
during
their
voyage
to
lisbon
and
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
moseley
was
as
sincerely
disposed
to
perform
her
duty
as
her
powers
admitted
to
the
request
of
her
husband
that
she
would
take
a
seat
in
his
phaeton
while
he
drove
her
round
the
park
once
or
twice
grace
gave
a
mild
refusal
by
saying
it
is
sunday
my
dear
moseley
do
you
think
i
do
know
that
cried
john
gaily
there
will
be
everybody
there
and
the
better
day
the
better
deed
now
moseley
if
he
had
been
asked
to
apply
this
speech
to
the
case
before
them
would
have
frankly
owned
his
inability
but
his
wife
did
not
make
the
trial
she
was
contented
with
saying
as
she
laid
down
her
book
to
look
on
a
face
she
so
tenderly
loved
ah
moseley
you
should
set
a
better
example
to
those
below
you
in
life
i
wish
to
set
an
example
returned
her
husband
with
an
affectionate
smile
to
all
above
as
well
as
below
me
in
order
that
they
may
find
out
the
path
to
happiness
by
exhibiting
to
the
world
a
model
of
a
wife
in
yourself
dear
grace
as
this
was
uttered
with
a
sincerity
which
distinguished
the
manner
of
moseley
his
wife
was
more
pleased
with
the
compliment
than
she
would
have
been
willing
to
make
known
and
john
spoke
no
more
than
he
thought
for
a
desire
to
show
his
handsome
wife
was
the
ruling
passion
for
a
moment
the
husband
was
too
pressing
and
the
wife
too
fond
not
to
yield
the
point
and
grace
took
her
seat
in
the
carriage
with
a
kind
of
formed
resolution
to
improve
the
opportunity
by
a
discourse
on
serious
subjects
a
resolution
which
terminated
as
all
others
do
that
postpone
one
duty
to
discharge
another
of
less
magnitude
it
was
forgotten
wilson
had
listened
with
interest
to
the
efforts
of
john
to
prevail
on
his
wife
to
take
the
ride
and
on
her
leaving
the
room
to
comply
she
observed
to
emily
with
whom
she
now
remained
alone
here
is
a
consequence
of
a
difference
in
religious
views
between
man
and
wife
my
child
john
in
place
of
supporting
grace
in
the
discharge
of
her
duties
has
been
the
actual
cause
of
her
going
astray
emily
felt
the
force
of
her
aunt
remark
and
saw
its
justice
yet
her
love
for
the
offender
induced
her
to
say
john
will
not
lead
her
openly
astray
for
he
has
a
sincere
respect
for
religion
and
this
offence
is
not
unpardonable
dear
aunt
the
offence
is
assuredly
not
unpardonable
replied
wilson
and
to
infinite
mercy
it
is
hard
to
say
what
is
but
it
is
an
offence
and
directly
in
the
face
of
an
express
ordinance
of
the
lord
it
is
even
throwing
off
the
appearance
of
keeping
the
sabbath
day
holy
much
less
observing
the
substance
of
the
commandment
and
as
to
john
respect
for
holy
things
in
this
instance
it
was
injurious
to
his
wife
had
he
been
an
open
deist
she
would
have
shrunk
from
the
act
in
suspicion
of
its
sinfulness
either
john
must
become
christian
or
i
am
afraid
grace
will
fall
from
her
undertaking
wilson
shook
her
head
mournfully
while
emily
offered
up
a
silent
petition
that
the
first
might
speedily
be
the
case
lady
laura
had
been
early
in
her
visit
to
the
moseleys
and
as
denbigh
had
both
a
town
residence
and
a
seat
in
parliament
it
appeared
next
to
impossible
to
avoid
meeting
him
or
to
requite
the
pressing
civilities
of
his
wife
by
harsh
refusals
that
might
prove
in
the
end
injurious
to
themselves
by
creating
a
suspicion
that
resentment
at
his
not
choosing
a
partner
from
amongst
them
governed
the
conduct
of
the
moseleys
towards
a
man
to
whom
they
were
under
such
a
heavy
obligation
had
sir
edward
known
as
much
as
his
sister
and
daughters
he
would
probably
have
discountenanced
the
acquaintance
altogether
but
owing
to
the
ignorance
of
the
rest
of
her
friends
of
what
had
passed
wilson
and
emily
had
not
only
the
assiduities
of
lady
laura
but
the
wishes
of
their
own
family
to
contend
with
and
consequently
she
submitted
to
the
association
with
a
reluctance
that
was
in
some
measure
counteracted
by
their
regard
for
lady
laura
and
by
compassion
for
her
abused
confidence
a
distant
connexion
of
lady
moseley
had
managed
to
collect
in
her
house
a
few
hundred
of
her
nominal
friends
and
as
she
had
been
particularly
attentive
in
calling
in
person
on
her
venerable
relative
benfield
soon
after
his
arrival
in
town
out
of
respect
to
her
father
cousin
or
perhaps
mindful
of
his
approaching
end
and
remembering
there
were
such
things
as
codicils
to
wills
the
old
man
flattered
by
her
notice
and
yet
too
gallant
to
reject
the
favor
of
a
lady
consented
to
accompany
the
remainder
of
the
family
on
the
occasion
most
of
their
acquaintances
were
there
and
lady
moseley
soon
found
herself
engaged
in
a
party
at
quadrille
while
the
young
people
were
occupied
by
the
usual
amusements
of
their
age
in
such
scenes
emily
alone
feeling
but
little
desire
to
enter
into
the
gaiety
of
general
conversation
with
a
host
of
gentlemen
who
had
collected
round
her
aunt
and
sisters
offered
her
arm
to
benfield
on
seeing
him
manifest
a
disposition
to
take
a
closer
view
of
the
company
and
walked
away
with
him
they
wandered
from
room
to
room
unconscious
of
the
observation
attracted
by
the
sight
of
a
man
in
the
costume
of
benfield
leaning
on
the
arm
of
so
young
and
lovely
a
woman
as
his
niece
and
many
an
exclamation
of
surprise
ridicule
admiration
and
wonder
had
been
made
unnoticed
by
the
pair
until
finding
the
crowd
rather
inconvenient
to
her
companion
emily
gently
drew
him
into
one
of
the
apartments
where
the
and
the
general
absence
of
beauty
made
room
less
difficult
to
be
found
ah
emmy
dear
said
the
old
gentleman
wiping
his
face
times
are
much
changed
i
see
since
my
youth
then
you
would
see
no
such
throngs
assembled
in
so
small
a
space
gentlemen
shoving
ladies
and
yes
emmy
continued
her
uncle
in
a
lower
tone
as
if
afraid
of
uttering
something
dangerous
the
ladies
themselves
shouldering
the
men
i
remember
at
a
drum
given
by
lady
gosford
that
although
i
may
without
vanity
say
i
was
one
of
the
gallantest
men
in
the
rooms
i
came
in
contact
with
but
one
of
the
ladies
during
the
whole
evening
with
the
exception
of
handing
the
lady
juliana
to
a
chair
and
that
said
her
uncle
stopping
short
and
lowering
his
voice
to
a
whisper
was
occasioned
by
a
mischance
in
the
old
duchess
in
rising
from
her
seat
when
she
had
taken
too
much
strong
waters
as
she
was
at
times
a
little
troubled
with
a
pain
in
the
chest
emily
smiled
at
the
casualty
of
her
grace
and
they
proceeded
slowly
through
the
table
until
their
passage
was
stopped
by
a
party
at
the
game
of
whist
which
by
its
incongruous
mixture
of
ages
and
character
forcibly
drew
her
attention
the
party
was
composed
of
a
young
man
of
five
or
six
and
twenty
who
threw
down
his
cards
in
careless
indifference
and
heedlessly
played
with
the
guineas
which
were
laid
on
the
side
of
the
table
as
markers
or
the
fruits
of
a
former
victory
or
by
stealing
hasty
and
repeated
glances
through
the
vista
of
the
tables
into
the
gayer
scenes
of
the
adjoining
rooms
proved
he
was
in
duresse
and
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
make
his
escape
from
the
tedium
of
cards
and
ugliness
to
the
life
of
conversation
and
beauty
his
partner
was
a
woman
of
doubtful
age
and
one
whose
countenance
rather
indicated
that
the
uncertainty
was
likely
to
continue
until
the
record
of
the
divulged
the
so
often
contested
circumstance
to
the
world
her
eyes
also
wandered
to
the
gayer
scenes
but
with
an
expression
of
censoriousness
mingled
with
longings
nor
did
she
neglect
the
progress
of
the
game
as
frequently
as
her
more
heedless
partner
a
glance
thrown
on
the
golden
pair
which
was
placed
between
her
and
her
neighbor
on
her
right
marked
the
importance
of
the
corner
and
she
shuffled
the
cards
with
a
nervousness
which
plainly
denoted
her
apprehension
of
the
consequences
of
her
partner
abstraction
her
neighbor
on
the
right
was
a
man
of
sixty
and
his
vestments
announced
him
a
servant
of
the
sanctuary
his
intentness
on
the
game
proceeded
no
doubt
from
his
habits
of
reflection
his
smile
at
success
quite
possibly
from
charity
to
his
neighbors
his
frown
in
adversity
from
displeasure
at
the
triumphs
of
the
wicked
for
such
in
his
heart
he
had
set
down
miss
wigram
to
be
and
his
unconquerable
gravity
in
the
employment
from
a
profound
regard
to
the
dignity
of
his
holy
office
the
fourth
performer
in
this
trial
of
memories
was
an
ancient
lady
gaily
dressed
and
intently
eager
on
the
game
between
her
and
the
young
man
was
a
large
pile
of
guineas
which
appeared
to
be
her
exclusive
property
from
which
she
repeatedly
during
the
play
tendered
one
to
his
acceptance
on
the
event
of
a
hand
or
a
trick
and
to
which
she
seldom
failed
from
inadvertence
to
add
his
mite
contributing
to
accumulate
the
pile
two
double
and
the
rub
my
dear
doctor
exclaimed
the
senior
lady
in
triumph
sir
william
you
owe
me
ten
the
money
was
paid
as
easily
as
it
had
been
won
and
the
dowager
proceeded
to
settle
some
bets
with
her
female
antagonist

more
i
fancy
said
she
closely
scanning
the
contributions
of
the
maiden
i
believe
it
is
right
my
lady
was
the
answer
with
a
look
that
said
pretty
plainly
that
or
nothing
i
beg
pardon
my
dear
here
are
but
four
and
you
remember
two
on
the
corner
and
four
on
the
points
doctor
i
will
trouble
you
for
a
couple
of
guineas
from
miss
wigram
store
i
am
in
haste
to
get
to
the
countess
route
the
doctor
was
coolly
helping
himself
from
the
said
store
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
its
owner
and
secretly
exulting
in
his
own
judgment
in
requiring
the
stakes
when
the
maiden
replied
in
great
warmth
your
ladyship
forgets
the
two
you
lost
to
me
at
mrs
howard
it
must
be
a
mistake
my
dear
i
always
pay
as
i
lose
cried
the
dowager
with
great
spirit
stretching
over
the
table
and
helping
herself
to
the
disputed
money
benfield
and
emily
had
stood
silent
spectators
of
the
whole
scene
the
latter
in
astonishment
to
meet
such
manners
in
such
society
and
the
former
under
feelings
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
describe
for
in
the
face
of
the
dowager
which
was
inflamed
partly
from
passion
and
more
from
high
living
he
recognised
the
remains
of
his
lady
juliana
now
the
dowager
viscountess
haverford
emmy
dear
said
the
old
man
with
a
sigh
as
if
awaking
from
a
long
and
troubled
dream
we
will
go
the
phantom
of
forty
years
had
vanished
before
the
truth
and
the
fancies
of
retirement
simplicity
and
a
diseased
imagination
yielded
to
the
influence
of
life
and
common
sense
chapter
xl
with
harriet
now
closely
connected
with
them
by
marriage
as
well
as
attachment
the
baronet
family
maintained
a
most
friendly
intercourse
and
wilson
and
emily
a
prodigious
favorite
with
her
new
cousin
consented
to
pass
a
day
soberly
with
her
during
an
excursion
of
her
husband
to
windsor
on
business
connected
with
his
station
they
had
accordingly
driven
round
to
an
early
breakfast
and
chatterton
after
politely
regretting
his
loss
and
thanking
them
for
their
consideration
for
his
wife
made
his
bow
lady
harriet
denbigh
had
brought
the
baron
a
very
substantial
addition
to
his
fortune
and
as
his
sisters
were
both
provided
for
by
ample
settlements
the
pecuniary
distresses
which
had
existed
a
twelvemonth
before
had
been
entirely
removed
chatterton
income
was
now
large
his
demands
upon
it
small
and
he
kept
up
an
establishment
in
proportion
to
the
rank
of
both
husband
and
wife
wilson
cried
the
hostess
twirling
her
cup
as
she
followed
with
her
eyes
the
retreating
figure
of
her
husband
at
the
door
i
am
about
to
take
up
the
trade
of
miss
harris
and
become
a
not
on
your
own
behalf
so
soon
surely
rejoined
the
widow
oh
no
my
fortune
is
made
for
life
or
not
at
all
continued
the
other
gaily
but
in
behalf
of
our
little
friend
emily
here
me
cried
emily
starting
from
a
reverie
in
which
the
prospect
of
happiness
to
lady
laura
was
the
subject
you
are
very
good
harriet
for
whom
do
you
intend
me
whom
who
is
good
enough
for
you
but
my
cousin
pendennyss
ah
she
cried
laughing
as
she
caught
emily
by
the
hand
derwent
and
myself
both
settled
the
matter
long
since
and
i
know
you
will
yield
when
you
come
to
know
him
the
duke
cried
the
other
with
a
surprise
and
innocence
that
immediately
brought
a
blush
of
the
brightest
vermillion
into
her
face
yes
the
duke
said
lady
chatterton
you
may
think
it
odd
for
a
discarded
lover
to
dispose
of
his
mistress
so
soon
but
both
our
hearts
are
set
upon
it
the
earl
arrived
last
night
and
this
day
he
and
his
sister
dine
with
us
in
a
sober
way
now
my
dear
madam
turning
to
wilson
have
i
not
prepared
an
agreeable
surprise
for
you
surprise
indeed
said
the
widow
excessively
gratified
at
the
probable
termination
to
her
anxieties
for
this
meeting
but
where
are
they
from
from
northamptonshire
where
the
earl
has
already
purchased
a
residence
i
understand
and
in
your
neighborhood
too
so
you
perceive
he
at
least
begins
to
think
of
the
thing
a
certain
evidence
truly
cried
emily
his
having
purchased
the
house
but
was
he
without
a
residence
that
he
bought
the
deanery
oh
no
he
has
a
palace
in
town
and
three
seats
in
the
country
but
none
in
northamptonshire
but
this
said
the
lady
with
a
laugh
to
own
the
truth
he
did
offer
to
let
george
denbigh
have
it
for
the
next
summer
but
the
colonel
chose
to
be
nearer
eltringham
and
i
take
it
it
was
only
a
ruse
in
the
earl
to
cloak
his
own
designs
you
may
depend
upon
it
we
trumpeted
your
praises
to
him
incessantly
in
westmoreland
and
is
colonel
denbigh
in
town
said
wilson
stealing
an
anxious
glance
towards
her
niece
who
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
sensibly
changed
color
oh
yes
and
laura
is
as
happy
as
happy
as
myself
said
lady
chatterton
with
a
glow
on
her
cheeks
as
she
attended
to
the
request
of
her
housekeeper
and
left
the
room
her
guests
sat
in
silence
occupied
with
their
own
reflections
while
they
heard
a
summons
at
the
door
of
the
house
it
was
opened
and
footsteps
approached
the
door
of
their
own
room
it
was
pushed
partly
open
as
a
voice
on
the
other
side
said
speaking
to
a
servant
without
very
well
do
not
disturb
your
lady
i
am
in
no
haste
at
the
sound
of
its
well
known
tones
both
the
ladies
almost
sprang
from
their
seats
here
could
be
no
resemblance
and
a
moment
removed
their
doubts
the
speaker
entered
it
was
denbigh
he
stood
for
a
moment
fixed
as
a
statue
it
was
evident
the
surprise
was
mutual
his
face
was
pale
as
death
and
then
instantly
was
succeeded
by
a
glow
of
fire
approaching
them
he
paid
his
compliments
with
great
earnestness
and
in
a
voice
in
which
his
softest
tones
preponderated
i
am
happy
very
happy
to
be
so
fortunate
in
again
meeting
with
such
friends
and
so
unexpectedly
wilson
bowed
in
silence
to
his
compliment
and
emily
pale
as
himself
sat
with
her
eyes
fastened
on
the
carpet
without
daring
to
trust
her
voice
with
an
attempt
to
speak
after
struggling
with
his
mortified
feelings
for
a
moment
denbigh
rose
from
the
chair
he
had
taken
and
drawing
near
the
sofa
on
which
the
ladies
were
placed
exclaimed
with
fervor
tell
me
dear
madam
lovely
too
lovely
miss
moseley
has
one
act
of
folly
of
wickedness
if
you
please
lost
me
your
good
opinion
for
ever
derwent
had
given
me
hopes
that
you
yet
retained
some
esteem
for
my
character
lowered
as
i
acknowledge
it
to
be
in
my
own
estimation
the
duke
of
derwent
mr
denbigh
do
not
do
not
use
a
name
dear
madam
almost
hateful
to
me
cried
he
in
a
tone
of
despair
if
said
wilson
gravely
you
have
made
your
own
name
disreputable
i
can
only
regret
it
but
call
me
by
my
title
oh
do
not
remind
me
of
my
folly
i
can
not
bear
it
and
from
you
your
title
exclaimed
wilson
with
a
cry
of
wonder
and
emily
turned
on
him
a
face
in
which
the
flashes
of
color
and
succeeding
paleness
were
as
quick
and
almost
as
vivid
as
the
glow
of
lightning
he
caught
their
astonishment
in
equal
surprise
how
is
this
some
dreadful
mistake
of
which
i
am
yet
in
ignorance
he
cried
taking
the
unresisting
hand
of
wilson
and
pressing
it
with
warmth
between
both
his
own
as
he
added
do
not
leave
me
in
suspense
for
the
sake
of
truth
for
my
sake
for
the
sake
of
this
suffering
innocent
say
in
sincerity
who
and
what
you
are
said
wilson
in
a
solemn
voice
gazing
on
him
in
dread
of
his
reply
still
retaining
her
hand
he
dropped
on
his
knees
before
her
as
he
answered
i
am
the
pupil
the
child
of
your
late
husband
the
companion
of
his
dangers
the
sharer
of
his
joys
and
griefs
and
would
i
could
add
the
friend
of
his
widow
i
am
the
earl
of
pendennyss
wilson
head
dropped
on
the
shoulders
of
the
kneeling
youth
her
arms
were
thrown
in
fervor
around
his
neck
and
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
for
a
moment
both
were
absorbed
in
their
own
feelings
but
a
cry
from
pendennyss
aroused
the
aunt
to
the
situation
of
her
niece
emily
had
fallen
senseless
on
the
sofa
an
hour
elapsed
before
her
engagements
admitted
of
the
return
of
lady
chatterton
to
the
breakfast
parlor
where
she
was
surprised
to
find
the
breakfast
equipage
yet
standing
and
her
cousin
the
earl
looking
from
one
to
the
other
in
surprise
she
exclaimed
very
sociable
upon
my
word
how
long
has
your
lordship
honored
my
house
with
your
presence
and
have
you
taken
the
liberty
to
introduce
yourself
to
wilson
and
miss
moseley
sociability
and
ease
are
the
fashion
of
the
day
i
have
been
here
an
hour
my
dear
coz
and
have
taken
the
liberty
of
introducing
myself
to
wilson
and
miss
moseley
replied
the
earl
gravely
although
a
smile
of
meaning
lighted
his
handsome
features
as
he
uttered
the
latter
part
of
the
sentence
which
was
returned
by
emily
with
a
look
of
archness
and
pleasure
that
would
have
graced
her
happiest
moments
of
juvenile
joy
there
was
such
an
interchange
of
looks
and
such
a
visible
alteration
in
the
appearance
of
her
guests
that
it
could
not
but
attract
the
notice
of
lady
chatterton
after
listening
to
the
conversation
between
them
for
some
time
in
silence
and
wondering
what
could
have
wrought
so
sudden
a
change
below
stairs
she
broke
forth
with
saying
upon
my
word
you
are
an
incomprehensible
party
to
me
i
left
you
ladies
alone
and
find
a
gentleman
with
you
i
left
you
grave
if
not
melancholy
and
find
you
all
life
and
gaiety
i
find
you
with
a
stranger
and
you
talk
with
him
about
walks
and
rides
and
scenes
and
acquaintances
will
you
madam
or
you
my
lord
be
so
kind
as
to
explain
these
seeming
inconsistencies
no
cried
the
earl
to
punish
your
curiosity
i
will
keep
you
in
ignorance
but
marian
is
in
waiting
for
me
at
your
neighbor
wilmot
and
i
must
hasten
to
her
you
will
see
us
both
by
five
rising
from
his
seat
he
took
the
offered
hand
of
wilson
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
to
emily
he
also
extended
his
hand
and
received
hers
in
return
though
with
a
face
suffused
with
the
color
of
the
rose
pendennyss
held
it
to
his
heart
for
a
moment
with
fervor
and
kissing
it
precipitately
left
the
room
emily
concealed
her
face
with
her
hands
and
dissolving
in
tears
sought
the
retirement
of
an
adjoining
apartment
all
these
unaccountable
movements
filled
lady
chatterton
with
amazement
that
would
have
been
too
painful
for
further
endurance
and
wilson
knowing
that
further
concealment
with
so
near
a
connexion
would
be
impossible
if
not
unnecessary
entered
into
a
brief
explanation
of
the
earl
masquerade
although
ignorant
herself
of
its
cause
or
of
the
means
of
supporting
it
and
his
present
relation
with
her
niece
i
declare
it
is
provoking
cried
lady
chatterton
with
a
tear
in
her
eye
to
have
such
ingenious
plans
as
derwent
and
i
had
made
lost
from
the
want
of
necessity
in
putting
them
in
force
your
demure
niece
has
deceived
us
all
handsomely
and
my
rigid
cousin
too
i
will
rate
him
soundly
for
his
deception
i
believe
he
already
repents
sincerely
of
his
having
practised
it
said
wilson
and
is
sufficiently
punished
for
his
error
by
its
consequence
a
life
of
misery
for
four
months
is
a
serious
penalty
to
a
lover
yes
said
the
other
i
am
afraid
his
punishment
was
not
confined
to
himself
alone
he
has
made
others
suffer
from
his
misconduct
i
will
rate
him
famously
depend
upon
it
i
will
if
anything
the
interest
felt
by
lady
chatterton
for
her
friend
was
increased
by
this
discovery
of
the
affections
of
pendennyss
and
a
few
hours
were
passed
by
the
three
in
we
will
not
say
sober
delight
for
transport
would
be
a
better
word
lady
chatterton
frankly
declared
that
she
would
rather
see
emily
the
wife
of
the
earl
than
of
her
brother
for
he
alone
was
good
enough
for
her
and
wilson
felt
an
exhilaration
of
spirits
in
the
completion
of
her
most
sanguine
wishes
that
neither
her
years
her
philosophy
nor
even
her
religion
could
entirely
restrain
the
face
of
emily
was
a
continued
blush
her
eye
sparkled
with
the
lustre
of
renewed
hope
and
her
bosom
was
heaving
with
the
purest
emotions
of
happiness
at
the
appointed
hour
the
rattling
of
wheels
announced
the
approach
of
the
earl
and
his
sister
pendennyss
came
into
the
room
with
a
young
woman
of
great
personal
beauty
and
extremely
feminine
manners
leaning
on
his
arm
he
first
announced
her
to
wilson
as
his
sister
lady
marian
denbigh
who
received
her
with
a
frank
cordiality
that
made
them
instantly
acquainted
emily
although
confiding
in
the
fullest
manner
in
the
truth
and
worth
of
her
lover
had
felt
an
inexplicable
sensation
of
pleasure
as
she
heard
the
earl
speak
of
his
sister
by
the
name
of
marian
love
is
such
an
unquiet
and
generally
such
an
engrossing
passion
that
few
avoid
unnecessary
uneasiness
while
under
its
influence
unless
so
situated
as
to
enjoy
a
mutual
confidence
as
this
once
so
formidable
marian
approached
to
salute
her
with
an
extended
hand
emily
rose
with
a
face
illumined
with
pleasure
to
receive
her
marian
viewed
her
for
a
moment
intently
and
folding
her
arms
around
her
whispered
softly
as
she
pressed
her
to
her
heart
my
sister
my
only
sister
our
heroine
was
affected
to
tears
and
pendennyss
gently
separating
the
two
he
loved
best
in
the
world
they
soon
became
calm
lady
marian
was
extremely
like
her
brother
and
had
a
family
resemblance
to
her
cousin
harriet
but
her
manners
were
softer
and
more
retiring
and
she
had
a
slight
tinge
of
a
settled
melancholy
when
her
brother
spoke
she
was
generally
silent
not
in
fear
but
in
love
she
evidently
regarded
him
amongst
the
first
of
human
beings
and
all
her
love
was
amply
returned
both
the
aunt
and
niece
studied
the
manners
of
the
earl
closely
and
found
several
shades
of
distinction
between
what
he
was
and
what
he
had
been
he
was
now
the
perfect
man
of
the
world
without
having
lost
the
frank
sincerity
which
caused
you
to
believe
all
he
said
had
pendennyss
once
told
wilson
with
his
natural
air
and
manner
i
am
innocent
she
would
have
believed
him
and
an
earlier
investigation
would
have
saved
them
months
of
misery
but
the
consciousness
of
his
deception
had
oppressed
him
with
the
curse
of
the
wicked
pendennyss
had
lost
that
air
of
embarrassment
and
alarm
which
had
so
often
startled
the
aunt
even
in
her
hours
of
greatest
confidence
and
which
had
their
original
in
the
awkwardness
of
disguise
but
he
retained
his
softness
his
respect
his
modest
diffidence
of
his
opinions
although
somewhat
corrected
now
by
his
acknowledged
experience
and
acquaintance
with
man
wilson
thought
these
decided
trifling
alterations
in
manner
were
improvements
but
it
required
some
days
and
a
few
tender
speeches
to
reconcile
emily
to
any
change
in
the
appearance
of
denbigh
lady
marian
had
ordered
her
carriage
early
as
she
had
not
anticipated
the
pleasure
she
found
and
was
engaged
to
accompany
her
cousin
lady
laura
to
a
fashionable
rout
that
evening
unwilling
to
be
torn
from
ins
newly
found
friends
the
earl
proposed
that
the
three
ladies
should
accompany
his
sister
to
annerdale
house
and
then
accept
himself
as
an
escort
to
their
own
residence
to
this
harriet
assented
and
leaving
a
message
for
chatterton
they
entered
the
coach
of
marian
and
pendennyss
mounting
the
dickey
drove
off
annerdale
house
was
amongst
the
best
edifices
of
london
it
had
been
erected
in
the
preceding
century
and
emily
for
a
moment
felt
as
she
went
through
its
splendid
apartments
that
it
threw
a
chill
around
her
domestic
affections
but
the
figure
of
pendennyss
by
her
side
reconciled
her
to
a
magnificence
she
had
been
unused
to
which
looked
the
lord
indeed
but
with
so
much
modesty
and
softness
and
so
much
attention
to
herself
that
before
she
left
the
house
emily
began
to
think
it
very
possible
to
enjoy
happiness
even
in
the
lap
of
splendor
the
names
of
colonel
denbigh
and
lady
laura
were
soon
announced
and
this
formidable
gentleman
made
his
appearance
he
resembled
pendennyss
more
than
even
the
duke
and
appeared
about
the
same
age
wilson
soon
saw
that
she
had
no
grounds
for
pitying
lady
laura
the
colonel
was
a
polished
elegant
man
of
evident
good
sense
and
knowledge
of
the
world
and
apparently
devoted
to
his
wife
he
was
called
george
frequently
by
all
his
relatives
and
he
not
unfrequently
used
the
same
term
himself
in
speaking
to
the
earl
something
was
said
of
a
much
admired
bust
and
the
doors
of
a
large
library
were
opened
to
view
it
emily
was
running
over
the
backs
of
a
case
of
books
until
her
eye
rested
on
one
and
half
smiling
and
blushing
she
turned
to
pendennyss
who
watched
every
movement
as
she
said
playfully
pity
me
my
lord
and
lend
me
this
volume
what
is
it
you
read
he
asked
as
he
bowed
his
cheerful
assent
but
emily
hid
the
book
in
her
handkerchief
pendennyss
noticing
an
unwillingness
though
an
extremely
playful
one
to
let
him
into
the
secret
examined
the
case
and
perceiving
her
motive
smiled
as
he
took
down
another
volume
and
said
i
am
not
an
irish
but
an
english
peer
emily
you
have
the
wrong
volume
emily
laughed
with
deeper
blushes
when
she
found
her
wishes
detected
while
the
earl
opening
the
volume
he
held
the
first
of
peerage
pointed
with
his
finger
to
the
article
concerning
his
own
family
and
said
to
wilson
who
had
joined
them
at
the
instant
dear
madam
i
shall
beg
your
attention
to
a
melancholy
tale
and
which
may
in
some
slight
degree
extenuate
the
offence
i
was
guilty
of
in
assuming
or
rather
in
maintaining
an
accidental
disguise
as
he
ended
he
went
to
the
others
to
draw
off
their
attention
while
emily
and
her
aunt
examined
the
paragraph
it
was
as
follows
george
denbigh
earl
of
pendennyss
and
baron
lumley
of
lumley
baron
pendennyss
beaumaris
and
fitzwalter
born
of
in
the
year
of
a
bachelor
the
list
of
earls
and
nobles
occupied
several
pages
but
the
closing
article
was
as
follows
george
the
earl
succeeded
his
mother
marian
late
countess
of
pendennyss
in
her
own
right
being
born
of
her
marriage

general
will
descend
to
his
lordship
sister
lady
marian
denbigh
should
the
present
earl
die
without
lawful
issue
as
much
of
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
of
our
tales
involved
in
the
foregoing
paragraphs
we
may
be
allowed
to
relate
in
our
own
language
what
pendennyss
made
his
friends
acquainted
with
at
different
times
and
in
a
manner
suitable
to
the
subject
and
his
situation
chapter
xli
it
was
at
the
close
of
that
war
which
lost
this
country
the
wealthiest
and
most
populous
of
her
american
colonies
that
a
fleet
of
ships
were
returning
from
their
service
amongst
the
islands
of
the
new
world
to
seek
for
their
worn
out
and
battered
hulks
and
equally
weakened
crews
the
repairs
and
comforts
of
england
and
home
the
latter
word
to
the
mariner
the
most
endearing
of
all
sounds
had
as
it
were
drawn
together
by
instinct
a
group
of
sailors
on
the
forecastle
of
the
proudest
ship
of
the
squadron
who
gazed
with
varied
emotions
on
the
land
which
gave
them
birth
but
with
one
common
feeling
of
joy
that
the
day
of
attaining
it
was
at
length
arrived
the
water
curled
from
the
bows
of
this
castle
of
the
ocean
in
increasing
waves
and
growing
murmurs
that
at
times
drew
the
attention
of
the
veteran
tar
to
their
quickening
progress
and
having
cheered
his
heart
with
the
sight
he
cast
his
experienced
eye
in
silence
on
the
swelling
sails
to
see
if
nothing
more
could
be
done
to
shorten
the
distance
between
him
and
his
country
hundreds
of
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
land
of
their
birth
and
hundreds
of
hearts
were
beating
in
that
one
vessel
with
the
awakening
delights
of
domestic
love
and
renewed
affections
but
no
tongue
broke
the
disciplined
silence
of
the
ship
into
sounds
that
overcame
the
propitious
ripple
of
the
water
on
the
highest
summit
of
their
towering
mast
floated
a
small
blue
flag
the
symbol
of
authority
and
beneath
it
paced
a
man
to
and
fro
the
deck
who
was
abandoned
by
his
inferiors
to
his
more
elevated
rank
his
form
and
careworn
features
which
had
lost
the
brilliancy
of
an
english
complexion
and
hair
whitened
prematurely
spoke
of
bodily
vigor
and
arduous
services
which
had
put
that
vigor
to
the
severest
trials
at
each
turn
of
his
walk
as
he
faced
the
land
of
his
nativity
a
lurking
smile
stole
over
his
features
and
then
a
glance
of
his
eye
would
scan
the
progress
of
the
squadron
which
obeyed
his
orders
and
which
he
was
now
returning
to
his
superiors
undiminished
in
numbers
and
proud
with
victory
by
himself
stood
an
officer
in
a
uniform
differing
from
all
around
him
his
figure
was
small
his
eye
restless
quick
and
piercing
and
bent
on
those
shores
to
which
he
was
unwillingly
advancing
with
a
look
of
anxiety
and
mortification
that
showed
him
the
late
commander
of
those
vessels
around
them
which
by
displaying
their
double
flags
manifested
to
the
eye
of
the
seaman
a
recent
change
of
masters
occasionally
the
conqueror
would
stop
and
by
some
effort
of
well
meant
but
rather
uncouth
civility
endeavor
to
soften
the
hours
of
captivity
efforts
which
were
received
with
the
courtesy
of
the
most
punctilious
etiquette
but
a
restraint
which
showed
that
they
were
unwelcome
it
was
perhaps
the
most
unlucky
moment
that
had
occurred
within
the
two
months
of
their
association
for
an
exchange
of
their
better
feelings
the
honest
heart
of
the
english
tar
dilated
with
delight
at
his
approach
to
the
termination
of
labors
performed
with
credit
and
honor
and
his
smiles
and
good
humor
which
partly
proceeded
from
the
feelings
of
a
father
and
a
friend
were
daggers
to
the
heart
of
his
discomfited
rival
a
third
personage
now
appeared
from
the
cabin
of
the
vessel
and
approached
the
spot
where
the
adverse
admirals
at
the
moment
were
engaged
in
one
of
these
constrained
conferences
the
appearance
and
dress
of
this
gentleman
differed
widely
from
the
two
just
described
he
was
tall
graceful
and
dignified
he
was
a
soldier
and
clearly
of
high
rank
his
carefully
dressed
hair
concealed
the
ravages
of
time
and
on
the
of
a
his
attire
and
manners
were
suited
to
a
in
the
park
i
really
insist
monsieur
cried
the
admiral
that
you
shall
take
part
of
my
chaise
to
london
you
are
a
stranger
and
it
will
help
to
keep
up
your
spirits
by
the
way
you
are
very
good
monsieur
howell
replied
the
frenchman
with
a
polite
bow
and
forced
smile
misconstruing
benevolence
into
a
wish
for
his
person
to
grace
a
triumph
but
i
have
accepted
the
offer
monsieur
le
general
denbigh
was
so
good
as
to
make
me
the
comte
is
engaged
to
me
howell
said
the
general
with
a
courtly
smile
and
indeed
you
must
leave
the
ship
to
night
or
as
soon
as
we
but
i
shall
take
daylight
and
well
well
denbigh
exclaimed
the
other
rubbing
his
hands
with
pleasure
as
he
viewed
the
increasing
power
of
the
wind
only
make
yourselves
happy
and
i
am
contented
a
few
hours
intervened
before
they
reached
the
bay
of
plymouth
and
round
the
table
after
their
dinner
were
seated
the
general
and
english
admiral
the
comte
under
the
pretence
of
preparing
his
things
for
a
removal
had
retired
to
his
apartment
to
conceal
his
feelings
and
the
captain
of
the
ship
was
above
superintending
the
approach
of
the
vessel
to
her
anchorage
two
or
three
well
emptied
bottles
of
wine
yet
remained
but
as
the
healths
of
all
the
branches
of
the
house
of
brunswick
had
been
propitiated
from
their
contents
with
a
polite
remembrance
of
louis
xvi
and
marie
antoinette
from
general
denbigh
neither
of
the
superiors
was
much
inclined
for
action
is
the
thunderer
in
her
station
said
the
admiral
to
the
signal
lieutenant
who
at
that
moment
came
below
with
a
report
yes
sir
and
has
answered
very
well
make
the
signal
to
prepare
to
anchor
aye
aye
sir
and
here
bennet
to
the
retiring
lieutenant
call
the
transports
all
in
shore
of
us
three
hundred
and
sir
said
the
officer
looking
at
his
the
admiral
cast
his
eye
at
the
book
and
nodded
an
assent
and
let
the
mermaid
flora
weasel
bruiser
and
all
the
sloops
lie
well
off
until
we
have
landed
the
soldiers
the
pilot
says
the
channel
is
full
of
luggers
and
jonathan
has
grown
very
saucy
the
lieutenant
made
a
complying
bow
and
was
retiring
to
execute
these
orders
as
admiral
howell
taking
up
a
bottle
not
yet
entirely
deserted
by
its
former
tenant
cried
stoutly
here
bennet
i
forgot
take
a
glass
of
wine
drink
success
to
ourselves
and
defeat
to
the
french
all
over
the
world
the
general
pointed
significantly
to
the
adjoining
cabin
of
the
french
admiral
as
he
pressed
his
hand
on
his
lips
for
silence
oh
cried
admiral
howell
recollecting
himself
continuing
in
a
whisper
you
can
drink
it
in
your
heart
notwithstanding
the
signal
officer
nodded
and
drank
the
liquor
as
he
smacked
his
lips
while
going
on
deck
he
thought
to
himself
these
nabobs
drink
famous
good
wine
although
the
feelings
of
general
denbigh
were
under
much
more
command
and
disciplined
obedience
than
those
of
his
friend
yet
was
he
too
unusually
elated
with
his
return
to
home
and
expected
honors
if
the
admiral
had
captured
a
fleet
he
had
taken
an
island
and
hand
in
hand
they
had
in
unusual
harmony
through
the
difficulties
of
an
arduous
campaign
this
rather
singular
circumstance
was
owing
to
their
personal
friendship
from
their
youth
they
had
been
companions
and
although
of
very
different
characters
and
habits
chance
had
cemented
their
intimacy
in
more
advanced
life
while
in
subordinate
stations
they
had
been
associated
together
in
service
and
the
general
and
admiral
in
command
of
an
army
and
fleet
had
once
before
returned
to
england
with
less
renown
as
a
colonel
and
a
captain
of
a
frigate
the
great
family
influence
of
the
soldier
with
the
known
circumstance
of
their
harmony
had
procured
them
this
later
command
and
home
with
its
comforts
and
rewards
was
close
before
them
pouring
out
a
glass
of
madeira
the
general
who
always
calculated
what
he
said
exclaimed
peter
we
have
been
friends
from
boys
to
be
sure
we
have
said
the
admiral
looking
up
in
a
little
surprise
at
this
unexpected
commencement
and
it
will
not
be
my
fault
if
we
do
not
die
such
frederick
dying
was
a
subject
the
general
did
not
much
delight
in
although
of
conspicuous
courage
in
the
field
and
he
proceeded
to
his
more
important
purpose
i
could
never
find
although
i
have
looked
over
our
family
tree
so
often
that
we
are
in
any
manner
related
howell
i
believe
it
is
too
late
to
mend
that
matter
now
said
the
admiral
musing
why
no
hem
i
think
not
howell
take
a
glass
of
this
burgundy
the
admiral
shook
his
head
with
a
stubborn
resolution
to
taste
nothing
french
but
he
helped
himself
to
a
bountiful
stock
of
madeira
as
he
replied
i
should
like
to
know
how
you
can
bring
it
about
this
time
of
day
denbigh
how
much
money
will
you
be
able
to
give
that
girl
of
yours
peter
said
his
friend
evading
the
point
forty
thousand
down
my
good
fellow
and
as
much
more
when
i
die
cried
the
sailor
with
a
nod
of
exultation
george
my
youngest
son
will
not
be
rich
but
francis
will
be
a
duke
and
have
a
noble
estate
yet
said
the
general
meditating
he
is
so
unhappy
in
his
disposition
and
uncouth
in
his
manners
i
can
not
think
of
offering
him
to
your
daughter
as
a
husband
isabel
shall
marry
a
man
like
myself
or
not
at
all
said
the
admiral
positively
but
not
in
the
least
suspecting
the
drift
of
his
friend
who
was
influenced
by
anything
but
a
regard
for
the
lady
happiness
francis
his
first
born
was
in
truth
as
he
had
described
but
his
governing
wish
was
to
provide
for
his
favorite
george
dukes
could
never
want
wives
but
unportioned
captains
in
the
guards
might
george
is
one
of
the
best
tempers
in
the
world
said
his
father
with
strong
feeling
and
the
delight
of
us
all
i
could
wish
he
had
been
the
heir
to
the
family
honors
that
it
is
certainly
too
late
to
help
cried
the
admiral
wondering
if
the
ingenuity
of
his
friend
could
devise
a
remedy
for
this
evil
too
too
late
indeed
said
the
other
with
a
heavy
sigh
but
howell
what
say
you
to
matching
isabel
with
my
favorite
george
denbigh
cried
the
sailor
eyeing
him
keenly
isabel
is
my
only
child
and
a
dutiful
good
girl
one
that
will
obey
orders
if
she
breaks
owners
as
we
sailors
say
now
i
did
think
of
marrying
her
to
a
seaman
when
a
proper
man
came
athwart
my
course
yet
your
son
is
a
soldier
and
that
is
next
to
being
in
the
navy
you
had
made
him
come
aboard
me
when
i
wanted
you
to
there
would
have
been
no
objection
at
all
however
when
occasion
offers
i
will
overhaul
the
lad
and
if
i
find
him
staunch
he
may
turn
in
with
bell
and
welcome
this
was
uttered
in
perfect
simplicity
and
with
no
intention
of
giving
offence
partaking
partly
of
the
nature
of
a
soliloquy
so
the
general
greatly
encouraged
was
about
to
push
the
point
when
a
gun
was
fired
from
their
own
ship
there
some
of
them
lubberly
transports
wo
mind
our
signals
they
have
had
these
soldiers
so
long
on
board
they
get
as
clumsy
as
the
coats
themselves
muttered
the
admiral
hastening
on
deck
to
enforce
his
commands
a
shot
or
two
sent
significantly
in
the
direction
of
the
wanderers
but
so
as
not
to
hit
them
restored
order
and
within
an
hour
forty
line
of
battle
ships
and
a
hundred
transports
were
disposed
in
the
best
manner
for
convenience
and
safety
on
their
presentation
to
their
sovereign
both
veterans
were
embellished
with
the
riband
of
the
bath
and
as
their
exploits
filled
the
mouths
of
the
newsmongers
and
the
columns
of
the
public
prints
of
the
day
the
new
knights
began
to
think
more
seriously
of
building
a
monument
to
their
victories
in
a
union
between
their
children
the
admiral
however
determined
to
do
nothing
with
his
eyes
shut
and
he
demanded
a
scrutiny
where
is
the
boy
who
is
to
be
a
duke
exclaimed
he
one
day
when
his
friend
had
introduced
the
point
with
a
view
to
a
final
arrangement
bell
has
good
blood
in
her
veins
is
a
tight
built
little
vessel
clean
heel
and
trim
and
would
make
as
good
a
duchess
as
the
best
of
them
so
denbigh
i
will
begin
by
taking
a
survey
of
the
senior
to
this
the
general
had
no
objection
as
he
well
knew
that
francis
would
be
wide
of
pleasing
the
tastes
of
an
simple
man
like
the
sailor
they
met
accordingly
for
what
the
general
facetiously
called
the
review
and
what
the
admiral
innocently
termed
his
survey
at
the
house
of
the
former
when
the
young
gentlemen
were
submitted
to
his
inspection
francis
denbigh
was
about
four
and
twenty
of
a
feeble
body
and
with
a
face
marked
with
the
to
approaching
deformity
his
eye
was
brilliant
and
piercing
but
unsettled
and
at
times
wild
his
manner
awkward
constrained
and
timid
there
would
be
seen
it
is
true
an
intelligence
and
animation
which
occasionally
lighted
his
countenance
into
gleams
of
sunshine
that
caused
you
to
overlook
the
lesser
accompaniments
of
complexion
and
features
in
the
expression
but
they
were
transient
and
inevitably
vanished
whenever
his
father
spoke
or
in
any
manner
mingled
in
his
pursuits
an
observer
close
as
wilson
would
have
said
that
the
feelings
of
the
father
and
son
were
not
such
as
ought
to
exist
between
parent
and
child
but
the
admiral
who
regarded
model
and
rigging
a
good
deal
satisfied
himself
with
muttering
as
he
turned
his
eye
on
the
junior
he
may
do
for
a
duke
but
i
would
not
have
him
for
a
cockswain
george
was
a
year
younger
than
francis
in
form
stature
and
personal
grace
the
counterpart
of
his
father
his
eye
was
less
keen
but
more
attractive
than
that
of
his
brother
his
air
open
polished
and
manly
ah
thought
the
sailor
as
he
ended
a
satisfactory
survey
of
the
youth
what
a
thousand
pities
denbigh
did
not
send
him
to
sea
the
thing
was
soon
settled
and
george
was
to
be
the
happy
man
sir
peter
concluded
to
dine
with
his
friend
in
order
to
settle
preliminaries
over
the
bottle
by
themselves
the
young
men
and
their
mother
being
engaged
to
their
uncle
the
duke
well
denbigh
cried
the
admiral
as
the
last
servant
withdrew
when
do
you
mean
to
have
the
young
couple
spliced
why
replied
the
wary
soldier
who
knew
he
could
not
calculate
on
obedience
to
his
mandate
with
as
great
a
certainty
as
his
friend
the
better
way
is
to
bring
the
young
people
together
in
order
that
they
may
become
acquainted
you
know
acquainted
together
cried
his
companion
in
a
little
surprise
what
better
way
is
there
to
bring
them
together
than
to
have
them
up
before
a
priest
or
to
make
them
acquainted
by
letting
them
swing
in
the
same
hammock
it
might
answer
the
end
indeed
said
the
general
with
a
smile
but
somehow
or
other
it
is
always
the
best
method
to
bring
young
folks
together
to
let
them
have
their
own
way
in
the
affair
for
a
time
own
way
rejoined
sir
peter
bluntly
did
you
ever
find
it
answer
to
let
a
woman
have
her
own
way
sir
frederick
not
common
women
certainly
my
good
friend
said
the
general
but
such
a
girl
as
my
intended
daughter
is
an
exception
i
do
know
that
cried
the
sailor
bell
is
a
good
girl
but
she
has
her
quirks
and
whims
like
all
the
sex
you
have
had
no
trouble
with
her
as
yet
i
believe
howell
said
sir
frederick
cavalierly
throwing
an
inquiring
glance
on
his
friend
at
the
same
time
no
not
yet
nor
do
i
think
she
will
ever
dare
to
mutiny
but
there
has
been
one
wishing
to
take
her
in
tow
already
since
we
got
in
how
said
the
other
in
alarm
who
what
is
he
some
officer
in
the
navy
i
suppose
no
he
was
a
kind
of
chaplain
one
parson
ives
a
good
sort
of
a
youth
enough
and
a
prodigious
favorite
with
my
sister
lady
hawker
well
what
did
you
answer
peter
said
his
companion
in
increasing
uneasiness
did
you
put
him
off
off
to
be
sure
i
did
do
you
think
i
wanted
a
barber
clerk
for
a
no
no
denbigh
a
soldier
is
bad
enough
without
having
a
preacher
the
general
compressed
his
lips
at
this
direct
attack
on
a
profession
that
he
thought
the
most
honorable
of
any
in
the
world
in
some
resentment
but
remembering
the
eighty
thousand
pounds
and
accustomed
to
the
ways
of
the
other
he
curbed
his
temper
and
inquired
but
miss
howell
your
daughter
how
did
she
stand
affected
to
this
priest
how
why
how
why
i
never
asked
her
never
asked
her
no
never
asked
her
she
is
my
daughter
you
know
and
bound
to
obey
my
orders
and
i
did
not
choose
she
should
marry
a
parson
but
once
for
all
when
is
the
wedding
to
take
place
general
denbigh
had
indulged
his
younger
son
too
blindly
and
too
fondly
to
expect
that
implicit
obedience
the
admiral
calculated
to
a
certainty
on
and
with
every
prospect
of
not
being
disappointed
from
his
daughter
isabel
howell
was
pretty
mild
and
timid
and
unused
to
oppose
any
of
her
father
commands
but
george
denbigh
was
haughty
positive
and
and
unless
the
affair
could
be
so
managed
as
to
make
him
a
willing
assistant
in
the
courtship
his
father
knew
it
might
be
abandoned
at
once
he
thought
his
son
might
be
led
but
not
driven
and
relying
on
his
own
powers
for
managing
the
general
saw
his
only
safety
in
executing
the
scheme
was
in
postponing
his
advances
for
a
regular
siege
to
the
lady
heart
sir
peter
chafed
and
swore
at
this
circumlocution
the
thing
could
be
done
as
well
in
a
week
as
in
a
year
and
the
veterans
who
for
a
miracle
had
agreed
in
their
rival
stations
and
in
doubtful
moments
of
success
were
near
splitting
on
the
point
of
marrying
a
girl
of
nineteen
as
sir
peter
both
loved
his
friend
and
had
taken
a
prodigious
fancy
to
the
youth
he
however
was
fain
to
submit
to
a
short
probation
you
are
always
for
going
a
way
to
do
a
thing
said
the
admiral
as
he
yielded
the
point
now
when
you
took
that
battery
had
you
gone
up
in
front
as
i
advised
you
you
would
have
taken
it
in
ten
minutes
instead
of
five
hours
yes
said
the
other
with
a
friendly
shake
of
the
hand
at
parting
and
lost
fifty
men
in
place
of
one
by
the
step
chapter
xlii
the
honorable
general
denbigh
was
the
youngest
of
three
sons
his
seniors
francis
and
george
were
yet
bachelors
the
death
of
a
cousin
had
made
francis
a
duke
while
yet
a
child
and
both
he
and
his
favorite
brother
george
had
decided
on
lives
of
inactivity
and
sluggishness
when
i
die
brother
the
oldest
would
say
you
will
succeed
me
and
frederick
can
provide
heirs
for
the
name
hereafter
this
arrangement
had
been
closely
adhered
to
and
the
two
elder
brothers
reached
the
ages
of
and
without
altering
their
condition
in
the
mean
time
frederick
married
a
young
woman
of
rank
and
fortune
the
fruits
of
their
union
being
the
two
young
candidates
for
the
hand
of
isabel
howell
francis
denbigh
the
eldest
son
of
the
general
was
naturally
diffident
and
in
addition
it
was
his
misfortune
to
be
the
reverse
of
captivating
in
external
appearance
the
sealed
his
doom
ignorance
and
the
violence
of
the
attack
left
him
indelibly
impressed
with
the
ravages
of
that
dreadful
disorder
oh
the
other
hand
his
brother
escaped
without
any
vestiges
of
the
complaint
and
his
spotless
skin
and
fine
open
countenance
met
the
gaze
of
his
mother
after
the
recovery
of
the
two
in
striking
contrast
to
the
deformed
lineaments
of
his
elder
brother
such
an
occurrence
is
sure
to
excite
one
of
two
feelings
in
the
breast
of
every
beholder
pity
or
disgust
and
unhappily
for
francis
maternal
tenderness
in
his
case
was
unable
to
counteract
the
latter
sensation
george
become
a
favorite
and
francis
a
neutral
the
effect
was
easy
to
be
seen
and
it
was
rapid
as
it
was
indelible
the
feelings
of
francis
were
sensitive
to
an
extreme
he
had
more
quickness
more
sensibility
more
real
talent
than
george
which
enabled
him
to
perceive
and
caused
him
to
feel
more
acutely
the
partiality
of
his
mother
as
yet
the
engagements
and
duties
of
the
general
had
kept
his
children
and
their
improvements
out
of
his
sight
but
at
the
ages
of
eleven
and
twelve
the
feelings
of
a
father
began
to
take
pride
in
the
possession
of
his
sons
on
his
return
from
a
foreign
station
after
an
absence
of
two
years
his
children
were
ordered
from
school
to
meet
him
francis
had
improved
in
stature
but
not
in
beauty
george
had
flourished
in
both
the
natural
diffidence
of
the
former
was
increased
by
perceiving
that
he
was
no
favorite
and
the
effect
began
to
show
itself
on
manners
at
no
time
engaging
he
met
his
father
with
doubt
and
he
saw
with
anguish
that
the
embrace
received
by
his
brother
much
exceeded
in
warmth
that
which
had
been
bestowed
on
himself
lady
margaret
said
the
general
to
his
wife
as
he
followed
the
boys
as
they
retired
from
the
dinner
table
with
his
eyes
it
is
a
thousand
pities
george
had
not
been
the
elder
he
would
have
graced
a
dukedom
or
a
throne
frank
is
only
fit
for
a
parson
this
speech
was
uttered
sufficiently
loud
to
be
overheard
by
both
the
sons
on
the
younger
it
made
a
pleasurable
sensation
for
the
moment
his
father
his
dear
father
had
thought
him
fit
to
be
a
king
and
his
father
must
be
a
judge
whispered
his
native
vanity
but
all
this
time
the
connexion
between
the
speech
and
his
brother
rights
did
not
present
themselves
to
his
mind
george
loved
this
brother
too
well
too
sincerely
to
have
injured
him
even
in
thought
and
so
far
as
francis
was
concerned
his
vanity
was
as
blameless
as
it
was
natural
the
effect
produced
on
the
mind
of
francis
was
different
both
in
substance
and
in
degree
it
mortified
his
pride
alarmed
his
delicacy
and
wounded
his
already
morbid
sensibility
to
such
an
extent
as
to
make
him
entertain
the
romantic
notion
of
withdrawing
from
the
world
and
of
yielding
a
birthright
to
one
so
every
way
more
deserving
of
it
than
himself
from
this
period
might
be
dated
an
opinion
of
francis
which
never
afterwards
left
him
he
fancied
he
was
doing
injustice
to
another
and
that
other
a
brother
whom
he
ardently
loved
by
continuing
to
exist
had
he
met
with
fondness
in
his
parents
or
sociability
in
his
playfellows
these
fancies
would
have
left
him
as
he
grew
into
life
but
the
affections
of
his
parents
were
settled
on
his
more
promising
brother
and
his
manners
daily
increasing
in
their
repulsive
traits
drove
his
companions
to
the
society
of
others
more
agreeable
to
their
own
buoyancy
and
joy
had
francis
denbigh
at
this
age
met
with
a
guardian
enough
to
fathom
his
real
character
and
competent
to
direct
his
onward
course
he
would
yet
have
become
an
ornament
to
his
name
and
country
and
a
useful
member
of
society
but
no
such
guide
existed
his
natural
guardians
in
his
particular
case
were
his
worst
enemies
and
the
boys
left
school
for
college
four
years
afterwards
each
advanced
in
his
respective
properties
of
attraction
and
repulsion
irreligion
is
hardly
a
worse
evil
in
a
family
than
favoritism
when
once
allowed
to
exist
in
the
breast
of
the
parent
though
hid
apparently
from
all
other
eyes
its
sad
consequences
begin
to
show
themselves
effects
are
produced
and
we
look
in
vain
for
the
cause
the
awakened
sympathies
of
reciprocal
caresses
and
fondness
are
mistaken
for
uncommon
feelings
and
the
forbidding
aspect
of
deadened
affections
is
miscalled
native
sensibility
in
this
manner
the
evil
increases
itself
until
manners
are
formed
and
characters
created
that
must
descend
with
their
possessor
to
the
tomb
in
the
peculiar
formation
of
the
mind
of
francis
denbigh
the
evil
was
doubly
injurious
his
feelings
required
sympathy
and
softness
and
they
met
only
with
coldness
and
disgust
george
alone
was
an
exception
to
the
rule
he
did
love
his
brother
but
even
his
gaiety
and
spirits
finally
tired
of
the
dull
uniformity
of
the
diseased
habits
of
his
senior
the
only
refuge
francis
found
in
his
solitude
amidst
the
hundreds
of
the
university
was
in
his
muse
and
in
the
powers
of
melody
the
voice
of
his
family
has
been
frequently
mentioned
in
these
pages
and
if
as
lady
laura
had
intimated
there
had
ever
been
a
siren
in
the
race
it
was
a
male
one
he
wrote
prettily
and
would
sing
these
efforts
of
his
muse
to
music
of
his
own
drawing
crowds
around
his
windows
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
to
listen
to
sounds
as
melodious
as
they
were
mournful
his
poetical
efforts
partook
of
the
distinctive
character
of
the
man
being
melancholy
wild
and
sometimes
pious
george
was
always
amongst
the
most
admiring
of
his
brother
auditors
and
would
feel
a
yearning
of
his
heart
towards
him
at
such
moments
that
was
painful
but
george
was
too
young
and
too
heedless
to
supply
the
place
of
a
monitor
or
to
draw
his
thoughts
into
a
more
salutary
train
this
was
the
duty
of
his
parents
and
should
have
been
their
task
but
the
world
his
rising
honors
and
his
professional
engagements
occupied
the
time
of
the
father
and
fashion
parties
and
pleasure
killed
the
time
of
his
mother
when
they
did
think
of
their
children
it
was
of
george
the
painful
image
of
francis
being
seldom
admitted
to
disturb
their
serenity
george
denbigh
was
without
suspicion
and
a
favorite
the
first
quality
taxed
his
generosity
the
second
subjected
him
to
fraud
and
the
third
supplied
him
with
the
means
but
these
means
sometimes
failed
the
fortune
of
the
general
though
handsome
was
not
more
than
competent
to
support
his
style
of
living
he
expected
to
be
a
duke
himself
one
day
and
was
anxious
to
maintain
an
appearance
now
that
would
not
disgrace
his
future
elevation
a
system
of
strict
but
liberal
economy
had
been
adopted
in
the
case
of
his
sons
they
had
for
the
sake
of
appearances
a
stated
and
equal
allowance
the
duke
had
offered
to
educate
the
heir
himself
and
under
his
own
eye
but
to
this
lady
margaret
had
found
some
ingenious
excuse
and
one
that
seemed
to
herself
and
the
world
honorable
to
her
natural
feeling
but
had
the
offer
been
made
to
george
these
reasons
would
have
vanished
in
the
desire
to
advance
his
interests
or
to
gratify
his
propensities
such
decisions
are
by
no
means
uncommon
parents
having
once
decided
on
the
merits
and
abilities
of
their
children
frequently
decline
the
interference
of
third
persons
since
the
improvement
of
their
denounced
offspring
might
bring
their
own
judgment
into
question
if
it
did
not
convey
an
indirect
censure
on
their
justice
the
heedlessness
of
george
brought
his
purse
to
a
state
of
emptiness
his
last
guinea
was
gone
and
two
months
were
wanting
to
the
end
of
the
quarter
george
had
played
and
been
cheated
he
had
ventured
to
apply
to
his
mother
for
small
sums
when
his
dress
or
some
trifling
indulgence
required
an
advance
and
always
with
success
but
here
were
sixty
guineas
gone
at
a
blow
and
pride
candor
forbade
his
concealing
the
manner
of
his
loss
if
he
made
the
application
this
was
dreadful
his
own
conscience
reproached
him
and
he
had
so
often
witnessed
the
violence
of
his
mother
resentments
against
francis
for
faults
which
appeared
to
him
very
trivial
not
to
stand
in
the
utmost
dread
of
her
more
just
displeasure
in
the
present
case
entering
the
apartment
of
his
brother
in
this
disturbed
condition
george
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
with
his
face
concealed
between
his
hands
sat
brooding
over
his
forlorn
situation
george
said
his
brother
soothingly
you
are
in
distress
can
i
relieve
you
in
any
way
oh
no
no
no
frank
it
is
entirely
out
of
your
power
perhaps
not
my
dear
brother
continued
the
other
endeavoring
to
draw
his
hand
into
his
own
entirely
entirely
said
george
then
springing
up
in
despair
he
exclaimed
but
i
must
live
i
can
not
die
live
die
cried
francis
recoiling
in
horror
what
do
you
mean
by
such
language
tell
me
george
am
i
not
your
brother
your
only
brother
and
best
friend
francis
felt
he
had
no
friend
if
george
was
not
that
friend
and
his
face
grew
pale
while
the
tears
flowed
rapidly
down
his
cheeks
george
could
not
resist
such
an
appeal
he
caught
the
hand
of
his
brother
and
made
him
acquainted
with
his
losses
and
his
wants
francis
mused
some
little
time
over
his
narration
ere
he
broke
silence
it
was
all
you
had
the
last
shilling
cried
george
beating
his
head
with
his
hand
how
much
will
you
require
to
make
out
the
quarter
oh
i
must
have
at
least
fifty
guineas
or
how
can
i
live
at
all
the
ideas
of
life
in
george
were
connected
a
good
deal
with
the
manner
it
was
to
be
enjoyed
his
brother
appeared
struggling
with
himself
and
then
turning
to
the
other
continued
but
surely
under
present
circumstances
you
could
make
less
do
less
never
hardly
that
interrupted
george
vehemently
if
lady
margaret
did
not
inclose
me
a
note
now
and
then
how
could
we
get
along
at
all
do
you
find
it
so
yourself
brother
i
do
know
said
francis
turning
pale
do
know
cried
george
catching
a
view
of
his
altered
countenance
you
get
the
money
though
i
do
not
remember
it
said
the
other
sighing
heavily
francis
cried
george
comprehending
the
truth
you
shall
share
every
shilling
i
receive
in
future
you
shall
indeed
you
shall
well
then
rejoined
francis
with
a
smile
it
is
a
bargain
and
you
will
receive
from
me
a
supply
in
your
present
necessities
without
waiting
for
an
answer
francis
withdrew
into
an
inner
apartment
and
brought
out
the
required
sum
for
his
brother
subsistence
for
two
months
george
remonstrated
but
francis
was
positive
he
had
been
saving
and
his
stock
was
ample
for
his
simple
habits
without
it
besides
you
forget
we
are
partners
and
in
the
end
i
shall
be
a
gainer
george
yielded
to
his
wants
and
his
brother
entreaties
and
he
gave
him
great
credit
for
the
disinterestedness
of
the
act
several
weeks
passed
without
any
further
allusion
to
this
disagreeable
subject
which
had
at
least
the
favorable
result
of
making
george
more
guarded
and
a
better
student
the
brothers
from
this
period
advanced
gradually
in
those
distinctive
qualities
which
were
to
mark
the
future
men
george
daily
improving
in
grace
and
attraction
francis
in
an
equal
ratio
receding
from
those
very
attainments
which
it
was
his
too
great
desire
to
possess
in
the
education
of
his
sons
general
denbigh
had
preserved
the
appearance
of
impartiality
his
allowance
to
each
was
the
same
they
were
at
the
same
college
they
had
been
at
the
same
school
and
if
frank
did
not
improve
as
much
as
his
younger
brother
it
was
unquestionably
his
own
obstinacy
and
stupidity
and
surely
not
want
of
opportunity
or
favor
such
then
were
the
artificial
and
accidental
causes
which
kept
a
noble
a
proud
an
acute
but
a
diseased
mind
in
acquirements
much
below
another
every
way
its
inferior
excepting
in
the
happy
circumstance
of
wanting
those
very
excellences
the
excess
and
indiscreet
management
of
which
proved
the
ruin
instead
of
the
blessing
of
their
possessor
the
duke
would
occasionally
rouse
himself
from
his
lethargy
and
complain
to
the
father
that
the
heir
of
his
honors
was
far
inferior
to
his
younger
brother
in
acquirements
and
remonstrate
against
the
course
which
produced
such
an
unfortunate
inequality
on
these
occasions
a
superficial
statement
of
his
system
from
the
general
met
the
objection
they
cost
the
same
money
and
he
was
sure
he
not
only
wished
but
did
everything
an
indulgent
parent
could
to
render
francis
worthy
of
his
future
honors
another
evil
of
the
admission
of
feelings
of
partiality
in
the
favor
of
one
child
to
the
prejudice
of
another
is
that
the
malady
is
contagious
as
well
as
lasting
it
exists
without
our
own
knowledge
and
it
seldom
fails
to
affect
those
around
us
the
uncle
soon
learnt
to
distinguish
george
as
the
hope
of
the
family
yet
francis
must
be
the
heir
of
its
honors
and
consequently
of
its
wealth
the
duke
and
his
brother
were
not
much
addicted
to
action
hardly
to
reflection
but
if
anything
could
rouse
them
to
either
it
was
the
reputation
of
the
house
of
denbigh
their
ideas
of
reputation
it
is
true
were
of
their
own
forming
the
hour
at
length
drew
near
when
george
expected
a
supply
from
the
judged
generosity
of
his
mother
it
came
and
with
a
heart
beating
with
pleasure
the
youth
flew
to
the
room
of
francis
with
a
determination
to
force
the
whole
of
his
twenty
pounds
on
his
acceptance
on
throwing
open
his
door
he
saw
his
brother
evidently
striving
to
conceal
something
behind
his
books
it
was
at
the
hour
of
breakfast
and
george
had
intended
for
a
novelty
to
share
his
brother
morning
repast
they
always
met
at
dinner
but
the
other
meals
were
made
in
their
own
rooms
george
looked
in
vain
for
the
usual
equipage
of
the
table
suspicion
flashed
upon
him
he
threw
aside
the
books
and
a
crust
of
bread
and
a
glass
of
water
met
his
eye
the
truth
now
flashed
upon
him
in
all
its
force
francis
my
brother
to
what
has
my
extravagance
reduced
you
exclaimed
the
contrite
george
with
a
heart
nearly
ready
to
burst
francis
endeavored
to
explain
but
a
sacred
regard
to
the
truth
held
him
until
dropping
his
head
on
the
shoulder
of
george
he
sobbed
out
it
is
a
trifle
nothing
to
what
i
would
do
for
you
my
brother
george
felt
all
the
horrors
of
remorse
and
was
much
too
generous
to
conceal
his
error
any
longer
he
wrote
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
whole
transaction
to
lady
margaret
francis
for
a
few
days
was
a
new
being
he
had
acted
nobly
his
conscience
approved
of
his
motives
and
of
his
delicate
concealment
of
them
he
in
fact
began
to
think
there
were
in
himself
the
seeds
of
usefulness
as
his
brother
who
from
this
moment
began
to
understand
his
character
better
attached
himself
more
closely
to
him
the
eye
of
francis
met
that
of
george
with
the
look
of
acknowledged
affection
his
mind
became
less
moody
and
his
face
was
sometimes
embellished
with
a
smile
the
reply
of
their
mother
to
the
communication
of
george
threw
a
damp
on
the
revived
hopes
of
the
senior
and
drove
him
back
into
himself
with
tenfold
humility
i
am
shocked
my
child
to
find
that
you
have
lowered
yourself
and
forgot
the
family
you
belong
to
so
much
as
to
frequent
those
houses
which
ought
not
to
be
suffered
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
universities
when
at
a
proper
age
and
in
proper
company
your
occasional
indulgence
at
cards
i
could
not
object
to
as
both
your
father
and
myself
sometimes
resort
to
it
as
an
amusement
but
never
in
low
company
the
consequence
of
mingling
in
such
society
is
that
you
were
cheated
and
such
will
always
be
your
lot
unless
you
confine
yourself
to
associates
more
becoming
your
rank
and
illustrious
name
as
to
francis
i
see
every
reason
to
condemn
the
course
he
has
taken
being
the
senior
by
a
year
he
should
have
taken
the
means
to
prevent
your
falling
into
such
company
and
he
should
have
acquainted
me
immediately
with
your
loss
in
place
of
wounding
your
pride
by
subjecting
you
to
the
mortification
of
receiving
a
pecuniary
obligation
from
one
so
little
older
than
yourself
and
exposing
his
own
health
by
a
diet
on
bread
and
water
as
you
wrote
me
for
a
whole
month
both
the
general
and
myself
are
seriously
displeased
with
him
and
think
of
separating
you
as
you
thus
connive
at
each
other
follies
george
was
too
indignant
to
conceal
this
letter
and
the
reflections
of
francis
were
dreadful
for
a
short
time
he
actually
meditated
suicide
as
the
only
method
of
removing
himself
from
before
the
advancement
of
george
had
not
george
been
more
attentive
and
affectionate
than
formerly
the
awful
expedient
might
have
been
resorted
to
from
college
the
young
men
went
one
into
the
army
and
the
other
to
the
mansion
of
his
uncle
george
became
an
elegant
gay
admired
captain
in
the
guards
and
francis
stalked
through
the
halls
of
his
ancestors
their
acknowledged
future
lord
but
a
misanthrope
hateful
to
himself
and
disagreeable
to
all
around
him
this
picture
may
be
highly
wrought
but
the
effects
in
the
case
of
francis
were
increased
by
the
peculiar
tone
of
his
diseased
state
of
mind
the
indulgence
of
favoritism
nevertheless
always
brings
its
own
sad
consequences
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
while
it
seldom
fails
to
give
sorrow
and
penitence
to
the
bosom
of
the
parents
chapter
xliii
no
little
art
and
management
had
been
necessary
to
make
the
admiral
auxiliary
to
the
indirect
plan
proposed
by
his
friend
to
bring
george
and
isabel
together
this
however
effected
the
general
turned
his
whole
strategy
to
the
impression
to
be
made
on
the
heart
of
the
young
gentleman
sir
frederick
denbigh
had
the
same
idea
of
the
virtue
of
management
as
the
dowager
lady
chatterton
but
he
understood
human
nature
better
like
a
prudent
officer
his
attacks
were
all
masked
and
like
a
great
officer
they
seldom
failed
of
success
the
young
couple
were
thrown
in
each
other
way
and
as
isabel
was
extremely
attractive
somewhat
the
opposite
to
himself
in
ardor
of
temperament
and
vivacity
modest
and
sensible
it
can
not
be
expected
that
the
association
was
maintained
by
the
youth
with
perfect
impunity
within
a
couple
of
months
he
fancied
himself
desperately
in
love
with
isabel
howell
and
in
truth
he
had
some
reason
for
the
supposition
the
general
watched
every
movement
of
his
son
with
a
wary
and
vigilant
eye
occasionally
adding
fuel
to
the
flame
by
drawing
his
attention
to
projects
of
matrimony
in
other
quarters
until
george
began
to
think
he
was
soon
to
undergo
a
trial
of
his
constancy
and
in
consequence
he
armed
himself
with
a
double
portion
of
admiration
for
his
isabel
in
order
to
enable
himself
to
endure
the
persecution
while
the
admiral
several
times
endangered
the
success
of
the
whole
enterprise
by
volunteer
contributions
to
the
hopes
of
the
young
man
which
only
escaped
producing
an
opposite
effect
to
that
which
was
intended
by
being
mistaken
for
the
overflowings
of
good
nature
and
friendship
after
suffering
his
son
to
get
as
he
thought
sufficiently
entangled
in
the
snares
of
cupid
sir
frederick
determined
to
fire
a
volley
from
one
of
his
masked
batteries
which
he
rightly
judged
would
bring
on
a
general
engagement
they
were
sitting
at
the
table
after
dinner
alone
when
the
general
took
the
advantage
of
the
name
of
miss
howell
being
accidentally
mentioned
to
say
by
the
by
george
my
friend
the
admiral
said
something
yesterday
on
the
subject
of
your
being
so
much
with
his
daughter
i
wish
you
to
be
cautious
and
not
to
give
the
old
sailor
offence
in
any
way
for
he
is
my
particular
friend
he
need
be
under
no
violent
apprehensions
cried
george
coloring
highly
with
shame
and
pride
i
am
sure
a
denbigh
is
no
unworthy
match
for
a
daughter
of
sir
peter
howell
oh
to
be
sure
not
boy
we
are
as
old
a
house
as
there
is
in
the
kingdom
and
as
noble
too
but
the
admiral
has
queer
notions
and
perhaps
he
has
some
cub
of
a
sailor
in
his
eye
for
a
be
prudent
my
boy
be
prudent
that
is
all
i
ask
of
you
the
general
satisfied
with
the
effect
he
had
produced
carelessly
arose
from
his
seat
and
joined
lady
margaret
in
her
george
remained
for
several
minutes
musing
on
his
father
singular
request
as
well
as
the
admiral
caution
when
he
sprang
from
his
seat
caught
up
his
hat
and
sword
and
in
ten
minutes
rang
at
sir
peter
door
in
grosvenor
square
he
was
admitted
and
ascending
to
the
he
met
the
admiral
on
his
way
out
nothing
was
further
from
the
thoughts
of
the
veteran
than
a
finesse
like
the
general
and
delighted
to
see
george
on
the
he
pointed
significantly
over
his
shoulder
towards
the
door
of
the
room
isabel
was
in
and
exclaimed
with
a
natured
smile
there
she
is
my
hearty
lay
her
aside
and
hang
me
if
she
strike
i
say
george
faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
remember
that
my
boy
no
nor
a
french
ship
george
would
have
been
at
some
loss
to
have
reconciled
this
speech
to
his
father
caution
if
time
had
been
allowed
him
to
think
at
all
but
the
door
being
open
he
entered
and
found
isabel
endeavoring
to
hide
her
tears
the
admiral
dissatisfied
from
the
beginning
with
the
tardy
method
of
despatching
things
thought
he
might
be
of
use
in
breaking
the
ice
for
george
by
trumpeting
his
praises
on
divers
occasions
to
his
daughter
under
all
circumstances
he
thought
she
might
be
learning
to
love
the
man
as
he
was
to
be
her
husband
and
speeches
like
the
following
had
been
frequent
of
late
from
the
parent
to
the
child
there
that
youngster
george
denbigh
now
bell
is
he
not
a
fine
looking
lad
then
i
know
he
is
brave
his
father
before
him
was
good
stuff
and
a
true
englishman
what
a
proper
husband
he
would
make
for
a
young
woman
he
loves
his
king
and
country
so
none
of
your
notions
about
religion
and
government
but
a
sober
religious
churchman
that
is
as
much
so
girl
as
you
can
expect
in
the
guards
no
methodist
to
be
sure
it
a
great
pity
he
was
sent
to
sea
you
think
so
but
cheer
up
girl
one
of
these
days
he
may
be
taking
a
liking
to
you
yet
isabel
whose
fears
taught
her
the
meaning
of
these
eloquent
praises
of
captain
denbigh
listened
to
these
harangues
in
silence
and
often
meditated
on
their
import
by
herself
in
tears
george
approached
the
sofa
on
which
the
lady
was
seated
before
she
had
time
to
conceal
the
traces
of
her
sorrow
and
in
a
voice
softened
by
emotion
he
took
her
hand
gently
as
he
said
what
can
have
occasioned
this
distress
to
miss
howell
if
anything
in
my
power
to
remove
or
which
a
life
devoted
to
her
service
can
mitigate
she
has
only
to
command
me
to
find
a
cheerful
obedience
the
trifling
causes
of
sorrow
in
a
young
woman
replied
isabel
endeavoring
to
smile
will
hardly
require
such
serious
services
to
remove
them
but
the
lady
was
extremely
interesting
at
the
moment
george
was
goaded
by
his
father
caution
and
urged
on
by
his
own
feelings
with
great
sincerity
and
certainly
much
eloquence
he
therefore
proffered
his
love
and
hand
to
the
acceptance
of
his
mistress
isabel
heard
him
in
painful
silence
she
respected
him
and
dreaded
his
power
over
her
father
but
unwilling
to
abandon
hopes
to
which
she
yet
clung
as
to
her
spring
of
existence
with
a
violent
effort
she
determined
to
throw
herself
on
the
generosity
of
her
lover
during
her
father
late
absence
isabel
had
as
usual
since
the
death
of
her
mother
been
left
with
his
sister
and
had
formed
an
attachment
for
a
young
clergyman
a
younger
son
of
a
baronet
and
the
present
ives
the
inclination
had
been
mutual
and
as
lady
hawker
knew
her
brother
to
be
perfectly
indifferent
to
money
she
could
see
no
possible
objection
to
its
indulgence
on
his
return
ives
made
his
proposals
as
related
and
although
warmly
backed
by
the
recommendations
of
the
aunt
he
was
refused
out
of
delicacy
the
wishes
of
isabel
had
not
been
mentioned
by
her
clerical
lover
and
the
admiral
supposed
he
had
only
complied
with
his
agreement
with
the
general
without
in
any
manner
affecting
the
happiness
of
his
daughter
by
his
answer
but
the
feelings
which
prompted
the
request
still
remained
in
full
vigor
in
the
lovers
and
isabel
now
with
many
blushes
and
some
hesitation
of
utterance
made
george
fully
acquainted
with
the
state
of
her
heart
giving
him
at
the
same
time
to
understand
that
he
was
the
only
obstacle
to
her
happiness
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
george
heard
her
without
pain
or
mortification
the
struggle
with
was
a
severe
one
but
his
better
feelings
prevailed
and
he
assured
the
anxious
isabel
that
from
his
importunities
she
had
nothing
to
apprehend
in
future
the
grateful
girl
overwhelmed
him
with
thanks
and
george
had
to
fly
ere
he
repented
of
his
own
generosity
miss
howell
intimated
in
the
course
of
her
narrative
that
a
better
understanding
existed
between
their
parents
than
the
caution
of
the
general
had
discovered
to
his
unsuspecting
child
and
george
was
determined
to
know
the
worst
at
once
at
supper
he
mentioned
as
if
in
remembrance
of
his
father
injunction
that
he
had
been
to
take
his
leave
of
miss
howell
since
he
found
his
visits
gave
uneasiness
to
her
friends
on
the
whole
he
added
endeavoring
to
yawn
carelessly
i
believe
i
shall
visit
there
no
more
nay
nay
returned
sir
frederick
a
little
displeased
at
his
obedience
i
meant
no
such
thing
neither
the
admiral
nor
myself
has
the
least
objection
to
your
visiting
in
moderation
indeed
you
may
marry
the
girl
with
all
our
hearts
if
you
can
agree
but
we
ca
agree
i
take
it
said
george
looking
up
at
the
wall
why
not
what
hinders
cried
his
father
unguardedly
only
only
i
do
like
her
said
the
son
tossing
off
a
glass
of
wine
which
nearly
strangled
him
you
do
cried
the
general
with
great
warmth
thrown
entirely
off
his
guard
by
this
unexpected
declaration
and
may
i
presume
to
ask
the
reason
why
you
do
not
like
miss
howell
sir
oh
you
know
one
never
pretends
to
give
a
reason
for
this
sort
of
feeling
my
dear
sir
then
cried
his
father
with
increasing
heat
you
must
allow
me
to
say
my
dear
sir
that
the
sooner
you
get
rid
of
these
sort
of
feelings
the
better
i
choose
you
shall
not
only
like
but
love
miss
howell
and
this
i
have
promised
her
father
i
thought
that
the
admiral
was
displeased
with
my
coming
to
his
house
so
much
or
did
i
not
understand
you
this
morning
i
know
nothing
of
his
displeasure
and
care
less
he
has
agreed
that
isabel
shall
be
your
wife
and
i
have
passed
my
word
to
the
engagement
and
if
sir
you
wish
to
be
considered
as
my
son
you
will
prepare
to
comply
george
was
expecting
to
discover
some
management
on
the
part
of
his
father
but
by
no
means
so
settled
an
arrangement
and
his
anger
was
in
proportion
to
the
deception
to
annoy
isabel
any
further
was
out
of
the
question
to
betray
her
base
and
the
next
morning
he
sought
an
audience
with
the
duke
to
him
he
mentioned
his
wish
for
actual
service
but
hinted
that
the
maternal
fondness
of
lady
margaret
was
averse
to
his
seeking
it
this
was
true
and
george
now
pressed
his
uncle
to
assist
him
in
effecting
an
exchange
the
boroughs
of
the
duke
of
derwent
were
represented
by
loyal
members
of
parliament
his
two
brothers
being
contemporary
with
benfield
in
that
honor
and
a
request
from
a
man
who
sent
six
members
to
the
commons
besides
having
a
seat
in
the
lords
in
his
own
person
must
be
listened
to
within
the
week
george
ceased
to
be
a
captain
in
the
guards
and
became
of
a
regiment
under
orders
for
america
sir
frederick
soon
became
sensible
of
the
error
his
warmth
had
led
him
into
and
endeavored
by
soothing
and
indulgence
to
gain
the
ground
he
had
so
unguardedly
lost
but
terrible
was
his
anger
and
bitter
his
denunciations
when
his
son
acquainted
him
with
his
approaching
embarkation
with
his
new
regiment
for
america
they
quarrelled
and
as
the
favorite
child
had
never
until
now
been
thwarted
or
spoken
harshly
to
they
parted
in
mutual
disgust
with
his
mother
george
was
more
tender
and
as
lady
margaret
never
thought
the
match
such
as
the
descendant
of
two
lines
of
dukes
was
entitled
to
form
she
almost
pardoned
the
offence
in
the
cause
what
this
here
cried
sir
peter
howell
as
he
ran
over
a
morning
paper
at
the
breakfast
table
captain
denbigh
late
of
the
guards
has
been
promoted
to
the
of
the
foot
and
sails
to
join
that
regiment
now
on
its
way
to
america
it
a
lie
bell
it
all
a
lie
not
but
what
he
ought
to
be
there
too
serving
his
king
and
country
but
he
never
would
serve
you
so
me
said
isabel
with
a
heart
throbbing
with
the
contending
feelings
of
admiration
for
george
generosity
and
delight
at
her
own
deliverance
what
have
i
to
do
with
the
movements
of
mr
denbigh
what
cried
her
father
in
astonishment
you
to
be
his
wife
it
all
agreed
upon
that
is
between
sir
frederick
and
me
which
is
the
same
thing
you
know
here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
general
himself
who
had
just
learnt
the
departure
of
his
son
and
hastened
with
the
double
purpose
of
breaking
the
intelligence
to
his
friend
and
of
making
his
own
peace
see
here
denbigh
exclaimed
the
admiral
pointing
to
the
paragraph
what
do
you
say
to
that
too
true
too
true
my
dear
friend
replied
the
general
shaking
his
head
mournfully
hark
ye
sir
frederick
denbigh
cried
the
admiral
fiercely
did
you
not
say
that
your
son
george
was
to
marry
my
daughter
i
certainly
did
sir
peter
and
am
sorry
to
say
that
in
defiance
of
my
entreaties
and
commands
he
has
deserted
his
home
and
in
consequence
i
have
discarded
him
for
ever
now
denbigh
said
the
admiral
a
good
deal
mollified
by
this
declaration
have
i
not
always
told
you
that
in
the
army
you
know
nothing
of
discipline
why
sir
if
he
was
a
son
of
mine
he
should
marry
blindfolded
if
i
chose
to
order
it
i
wish
now
bell
had
an
offer
and
dared
to
refuse
it
there
is
the
barber
clerk
you
know
said
the
general
a
good
deal
irritated
by
the
contemptuous
manner
of
his
friend
and
what
of
that
sir
frederick
said
the
sailor
sternly
if
i
choose
her
to
marry
a
she
shall
comply
ah
my
good
friend
said
the
general
willing
to
drop
the
disagreeable
subject
i
am
afraid
we
shall
both
find
it
more
difficult
to
control
the
affections
of
our
children
than
we
at
first
imagined
you
do
general
denbigh
said
the
admiral
with
a
curl
of
contempt
on
his
lip
and
ringing
the
bell
violently
he
bid
the
servant
send
his
young
lady
to
him
on
the
appearance
of
isabel
her
father
inquired
with
an
air
of
settled
meaning
where
young
ives
resided
it
was
only
in
the
next
street
and
a
messenger
was
sent
to
him
with
sir
peter
howell
compliments
and
a
request
to
see
him
without
a
moment
delay
we
see
we
see
my
old
friend
who
keeps
the
best
discipline
muttered
the
admiral
as
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
eager
expectation
of
the
return
of
his
messenger
the
wondering
general
gazed
on
his
friend
to
ascertain
if
he
was
out
of
his
senses
he
knew
he
was
quick
to
decide
and
excessively
obstinate
but
he
did
not
think
him
so
crazy
as
to
throw
away
his
daughter
in
a
fit
of
spleen
it
never
occurred
to
sir
frederick
however
that
the
engagement
with
himself
was
an
act
of
equal
injustice
and
folly
because
it
was
done
with
more
form
and
deliberation
which
to
the
eye
of
sober
reason
would
rather
make
the
matter
worse
isabel
sat
in
trembling
suspense
for
the
issue
of
the
scene
and
ives
in
a
few
minutes
made
his
appearance
in
no
little
alarm
on
entering
the
admiral
addressed
him
abruptly
by
inquiring
if
he
still
wished
to
marry
that
girl
pointing
to
his
daughter
the
reply
was
an
eager
affirmative
sir
peter
beckoned
to
isabel
who
approached
covered
with
blushes
and
her
father
having
placed
her
hand
in
that
of
her
lover
with
an
air
of
great
solemnity
he
gave
them
his
blessing
the
young
people
withdrew
to
another
room
at
sir
peter
request
when
he
turned
to
his
friend
delighted
with
his
own
decision
and
authority
and
exclaimed
there
fred
denbigh
that
is
what
i
call
being
minded
the
general
had
penetration
enough
to
see
that
the
result
was
agreeable
to
both
the
young
people
a
thing
he
had
long
apprehended
and
being
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
affair
in
any
way
that
did
not
involve
him
in
a
quarrel
with
his
old
comrade
he
gravely
congratulated
the
admiral
on
his
good
fortune
and
retired
yes
yes
said
sir
peter
to
himself
as
he
paced
up
and
down
his
room
denbigh
is
mortified
enough
with
his
joy
and
felicity
and
children
i
never
had
any
opinion
of
their
manner
of
discipline
at
all
too
much
bowing
and
scraping
i
sorry
though
he
is
a
priest
not
but
what
a
priest
may
be
as
good
a
man
as
another
but
let
him
behave
ever
so
well
he
can
only
get
to
be
a
bishop
at
the
most
heaven
forbid
he
should
ever
get
to
be
a
pope
after
all
his
boys
may
be
admirals
if
they
behave
themselves
and
he
went
to
seek
his
daughter

in
imagination
manned
her
nursery

rear

sir
peter
howell

the
marriage
of
his
daughter
but
eighteen
months
yet
that
was
sufficient
time
to
become
attached
to
his
invaluable
ives
insensibly
led
the
admiral
during
his
long
indisposition
to
a
more
correct
view
of
sacred
things
than
he
had
been
wont
to
entertain
and
the
old
man
breathed
his
last
blessing
both
his
children
for
their
kindness
and
with
an
humble
hope
of
future
happiness
some
time
before
his
death
isabel
whose
conscience
had
always
reproached
her
with
the
deception
practised
on
her
father
and
with
the
banishment
of
george
from
his
country
and
home
threw
herself
at
the
feet
of
sir
peter
and
acknowledged
her
transgression
the
admiral
heard
her
in
astonishment
but
not
in
anger
his
opinions
of
life
had
sensibly
changed
and
his
great
cause
of
satisfaction
with
his
new
son
removed
all
motives
for
regret
for
anything
but
for
the
fate
of
poor
george
with
the
noble
forbearance
and
tenderness
of
the
young
man
to
his
daughter
the
hardy
veteran
was
sensibly
touched
and
his
entreaties
with
sir
frederick
made
his
peace
with
a
father
already
longing
for
the
return
of
his
only
hope
the
admiral
left
colonel
denbigh
his
blessing
and
his
favorite
pistols
as
a
remembrance
of
his
esteem
but
he
did
not
live
to
see
the
reunion
with
his
family
george
had
soon
learnt
deprived
of
hope
and
in
the
midst
of
novelty
to
forget
a
passion
which
could
no
longer
be
prosperous
and
two
years
from
his
departure
returned
to
england
glowing
in
health
and
improved
in
person
and
manners
by
a
more
extensive
knowledge

and
mankind
chapter
xliv
during
the
time
occupied
by
the
foregoing
events
francis
continued
a
gloomy
inmate
of
his
uncle
house
the
duke
and
his
brother
george
were
too
indolent
and
inactive
in
their
minds
to
pierce
the
cloud
that
mortification
and
deadened
affections
had
drawn
around
the
real
character
of
their
nephew
and
although
he
was
tolerated
as
the
heir
he
was
but
little
loved
as
a
man
in
losing
his
brother
francis
lost
the
only
human
being
with
whom
he
possessed
any
sympathies
in
common
and
he
daily
drew
more
and
more
into
himself
in
gloomy
meditation
on
his
forlorn
situation
in
the
midst
of
wealth
and
expected
honors
the
attentions
he
received
were
paid
to
his
rank
and
francis
had
penetration
enough
to
perceive
it
his
visits
to
his
parents
were
visits
of
ceremony
and
in
time
all
parties
came
to
look
to
their
termination
with
pleasure
as
to
the
discontinuance
of
heartless
and
forced
civilities
affection
even
in
the
young
man
could
not
endure
repulsed
as
his
feelings
were
for
ever
and
in
the
course
of
three
years
if
his
attachments
were
not
alienated
from
his
parents
his
ardor
had
become
much
abated
it
is
a
dreadful
truth
that
the
bonds
of
natural
affection
can
be
broken
by
injustice
and
contumely
and
it
is
yet
more
to
be
deplored
that
when
from
such
causes
we
loosen
the
ties
habit
and
education
have
drawn
around
us
a
reaction
in
our
feelings
commences
we
seldom
cease
to
love
but
we
begin
to
hate
against
such
awful
consequences
it
is
one
of
the
most
solemn
duties
of
the
parent
to
provide
in
season
and
what
surer
safeguard
is
there
than
to
inculcate
those
feelings
which
teach
the
mind
to
love
god
and
in
so
doing
induce
love
to
the
whole
human
family
sir
frederick
and
lady
margaret
attended
the
church
regularly
repeated
the
responses
with
much
decency
toasted
the
church
next
to
the
king
even
appeared
at
the
altars
of
their
god
and
continued
sinners
from
such
sowings
no
good
fruit
could
be
expected
to
flourish
yet
francis
was
not
without
his
hours
of
devotion
but
his
religion
was
like
himself
reserved
superstitious
ascetic
and
gloomy
he
never
entered
into
social
worship
if
he
prayed
it
was
with
an
wish
to
end
this
life
of
care
if
he
returned
thanks
it
was
with
a
bitterness
that
mocked
the
throne
before
which
he
was
prostrate
such
pictures
are
revolting
but
their
originals
have
and
do
exist
for
what
enormity
is
there
of
which
human
frailty
unchecked
by
divine
assistance
may
not
be
guilty
francis
received
an
invitation
to
visit
a
brother
of
his
mother
at
his
seat
in
the
country
about
the
time
of
the
expected
return
of
george
from
america
and
in
compliance
with
the
wishes
of
his
uncles
he
accepted
it
the
house
was
thronged
with
visitors
and
many
of
them
were
ladies
to
these
the
arrival
of
the
unmarried
heir
of
the
house
of
derwent
was
a
subject
of
no
little
interest
his
character
had
however
preceded
him
and
a
few
days
of
his
awkward
and
as
they
conceived
sullen
deportment
drove
them
back
to
their
former
beaux
with
the
exception
of
one
and
she
was
not
only
amongst
the
fairest
of
the
throng
but
decidedly
of
the
highest
pretensions
on
the
score
of
birth
and
fortune
marian
lumley
was
the
only
surviving
child
of
the
last
duke
of
annerdale
with
whom
had
expired
the
higher
honors
of
his
house
but
the
earldom
of
pendennyss
with
numerous
ancient
baronies
were
titles
in
fee
and
together
with
his
princely
estates
had
descended
to
his
daughter
as
of
the
family
a
peeress
in
her
own
right
with
an
income
far
exceeding
her
utmost
means
of
expenditure
the
lovely
countess
of
pendennyss
was
a
prize
aimed
at
by
all
the
young
nobles
of
the
empire
educated
in
the
midst
of
flatterers
and
dependants
she
had
become
haughty
vain
and
supercilious
still
she
was
lovely
and
no
one
knew
better
how
to
practise
the
most
winning
arts
of
her
sex
when
whim
or
interest
prompted
her
to
the
trial
her
host
was
her
guardian
and
relative
and
through
his
agency
she
had
rejected
at
the
age
of
twenty
numerous
suitors
for
her
hand
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ducal
coronet
and
unfortunately
for
francis
denbigh
he
was
at
the
time
the
only
man
of
the
proper
age
who
could
elevate
her
to
that
enviable
distinction
in
the
kingdom
and
an
indirect
measure
of
her
own
had
been
the
means
of
his
invitation
to
the
country
like
the
rest
of
her
young
companions
marian
was
greatly
disappointed
on
the
view
of
her
intended
captive
and
for
a
day
or
two
she
abandoned
him
to
his
melancholy
and
himself
but
ambition
was
her
idol
and
to
its
powerful
rival
love
she
was
yet
a
stranger
after
a
few
struggles
with
her
inclinations
the
consideration
that
their
united
fortunes
and
family
alliances
would
make
one
of
the
wealthiest
and
most
powerful
houses
in
the
kingdom
prevailed
such
early
sacrifices
of
the
inclinations
in
a
woman
of
her
beauty
youth
and
accomplishments
may
excite
surprise
but
where
the
mind
is
left
uncultivated
by
the
hand
of
care
the
soul
untouched
by
the
love
of
goodness
the
human
heart
seldom
fails
to
set
up
an
idol
of
its
own
to
worship
in
the
countess
of
pendennyss
this
idol
was
pride
the
remainder
of
the
ladies
from
ceasing
to
wonder
at
the
manners
of
francis
had
made
them
the
subject
of
their
mirth
and
nettled
at
his
apparent
indifference
to
their
society
which
they
erroneously
attributed
to
his
sense
of
his
importance
they
overstepped
the
bounds
of
in
manifesting
their
displeasure
denbigh
cried
one
of
the
most
thoughtless
and
pretty
of
the
gay
tribe
to
him
one
day
as
francis
sat
in
a
corner
abstracted
from
the
scene
around
him
when
do
you
mean
to
favor
the
world
with
your
brilliant
ideas
in
the
shape
of
a
book
oh
no
doubt
soon
said
a
second
and
i
expect
they
will
be
homilies
or
another
volume
to
the
whole
duty
of
man
rather
cried
a
third
with
bitter
irony
another
canto
to
the
rape
of
the
lock
his
ideas
are
so
vivid
and
full
of
imagery
or
what
do
you
think
said
a
fourth
speaking
in
a
voice
of
harmony
and
tones
of
the
most
soothing
tenderness
of
pity
and
compassion
for
the
follies
of
those
inferior
minds
who
can
not
enjoy
the
reflections
of
a
good
sense
and
modesty
peculiarly
his
own
this
might
also
be
irony
and
francis
thought
it
so
but
the
tones
were
so
soft
and
conciliating
that
with
a
face
pale
with
his
emotions
he
ventured
to
look
up
and
met
the
eye
of
marian
fixed
on
him
in
an
expression
that
changed
his
hue
into
the
color
of
vermillion
he
thought
of
this
speech
he
reasoned
on
it
he
dreamt
on
it
but
for
the
looks
which
accompanied
it
like
the
rest
of
the
party
he
would
have
thought
it
the
cruellest
cut
of
them
all
but
that
look
those
eyes
that
voice
what
a
commentary
on
her
language
did
they
not
afford
francis
was
not
long
in
suspense
the
next
morning
an
excursion
was
proposed
which
included
all
but
himself
in
its
arrangements
he
was
either
too
reserved
or
too
proud
to
offer
services
which
were
not
required
several
gentlemen
had
contended
for
the
honor
of
driving
the
countess
in
a
beautiful
phaeton
of
her
own
they
grew
earnest
in
their
claims
one
had
been
promised
by
its
mistress
with
an
opportunity
of
trying
the
ease
of
the
carriage
another
was
delighted
with
the
excellent
training
of
her
horses
in
short
all
had
some
particular
claim
to
the
distinction
which
was
urged
with
a
warmth
and
pertinacity
proportionate
to
the
value
of
the
prize
to
be
obtained
marian
heard
the
several
claimants
with
an
ease
and
indifference
natural
to
her
situation
and
ended
the
dispute
by
saying
gentlemen
as
i
have
made
so
many
promises
from
the
dread
of
giving
offence
i
must
throw
myself
on
the
mercy
of
denbigh
who
alone
with
the
best
claims
does
not
urge
them
to
you
then
continued
she
approaching
him
with
the
whip
which
was
to
be
given
the
victor
i
adjudge
the
prize
if
you
will
condescend
to
accept
it
this
was
uttered
with
one
of
her
most
attractive
smiles
and
francis
received
the
whip
with
an
emotion
that
he
with
difficulty
could
control
the
gentlemen
were
glad
to
have
the
contest
decided
by
adjudging
the
prize
to
one
so
little
dangerous
and
the
ladies
sneered
at
her
choice
as
they
left
the
house
there
was
something
so
soothing
in
the
manners
of
lady
pendennyss
she
listened
to
the
little
he
said
with
such
a
respectful
attention
was
so
anxious
to
have
him
give
his
opinions
that
the
unction
of
flattery
thus
sweetly
applied
and
for
the
first
time
could
not
fail
of
its
wonted
effects
the
communications
thus
commenced
were
continued
it
was
so
easy
to
be
attentive
by
being
simply
polite
to
one
unused
to
notice
of
any
kind
that
marian
found
the
fate
of
the
young
man
in
her
hands
almost
as
soon
as
she
attempted
to
control
it
a
new
existence
opened
upon
francis
as
day
after
day
she
insensibly
led
him
to
a
display
of
powers
he
was
unconscious
until
now
of
possessing
himself
his
began
to
increase
his
limited
pleasures
to
multiply
and
he
could
now
look
around
him
with
a
sense
of
participation
in
the
delights
of
life
as
he
perceived
himself
of
consequence
to
this
much
admired
woman
trifling
incidents
managed
on
her
part
with
consummate
art
had
led
him
to
the
daring
inference
that
he
was
not
entirely
indifferent
to
her
and
francis
returned
the
incipient
affection
of
his
mistress
with
a
feeling
but
little
removed
from
adoration
week
flew
by
after
week
and
still
he
lingered
at
the
residence
of
his
kinsman
unable
to
tear
himself
from
the
society
of
one
so
worshipped
and
yet
afraid
to
take
a
step
by
making
a
distinct
declaration
which
might
involve
him
in
disgrace
or
ridicule
the
condescension
of
the
countess
increased
and
she
had
indirectly
given
him
the
most
flattering
assurances
of
his
success
when
george
just
arrived
from
america
having
first
paid
his
greetings
to
his
reconciled
parents
and
the
happy
couple
of
his
generosity
flew
to
the
arms
of
his
brother
in
suffolk
francis
was
overjoyed
to
see
george
and
george
delighted
in
the
visible
improvement
of
his
brother
still
francis
was
far
very
far
behind
his
junior
in
graces
of
mind
and
body
indeed
few
men
in
england
were
more
adapted
by
nature
and
education
for
female
society
than
was
colonel
denbigh
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
marian
witnessed
all
his
attractions
and
deeply
felt
their
influence
for
the
first
time
she
felt
the
emotions
of
the
gentle
passion
and
after
having
sported
in
the
gay
world
and
trifled
with
the
feelings
of
others
for
years
the
countess
in
her
turn
became
an
unwilling
victim
to
its
power
george
met
her
flame
with
a
corresponding
ardor
and
the
struggle
between
ambition
and
love
became
severe
the
brothers
unconsciously
were
rivals
had
george
for
a
moment
suspected
the
situation
of
the
feelings
of
francis
his
very
superiority
in
the
contest
would
have
induced
him
to
retreat
from
the
unnatural
rivalry
had
the
elder
dreamt
of
the
views
of
his
junior
he
would
have
abandoned
his
dearest
hopes
in
utter
despair
francis
had
so
long
been
accustomed
to
consider
george
as
his
superior
in
everything
that
a
competition
with
him
would
have
appeared
desperate
marian
contrived
to
keep
both
in
hopes
undecided
herself
which
to
choose
and
perhaps
ready
to
yield
to
the
first
applicant
a
sudden
event
however
removed
all
doubts
and
decided
the
fate
of
the
three
the
duke
of
derwent
and
his
bachelor
brother
became
so
dissatisfied
with
the
character
of
their
future
heir
that
they
as
coolly
set
about
providing
themselves
with
wives
as
they
had
performed
any
other
ordinary
transaction
of
life
they
married
cousins
and
on
the
same
day
the
choice
of
the
ladies
was
assigned
between
them
by
lots
and
if
his
grace
got
the
prettier
his
brother
certainly
got
the
richest
under
the
circumstances
a
very
tolerable
distribution
of
fortune
favors
these
double
marriages
dissolved
the
charm
of
francis
and
lady
pendennyss
determined
to
consult
her
wishes
a
little
pointed
encouragement
brought
out
the
declaration
of
george
and
he
was
accepted
francis
who
had
never
communicated
his
feelings
to
any
one
but
the
lady
and
that
only
indirectly
was
crushed
by
the
blow
he
continued
in
public
until
the
day
of
their
union
was
present
composed
and
silent
but
it
was
the
silence
of
a
mountain
whose
volcanic
contents
had
not
reached
the
surface
the
same
day
he
disappeared
and
every
inquiry
after
him
proved
fruitless
search
was
baffled
and
for
seven
years
it
was
not
known
what
had
become
of
the
general
eldest
son
george
on
marrying
resigned
his
commission
at
the
earnest
entreaties
of
his
wife
and
retired
to
one
of
her
seats
to
the
enjoyment
of
ease
and
domestic
love
the
countess
was
enthusiastically
attached
to
him
and
as
motives
for
the
indulgence
of
coquetry
were
wanting
her
character
became
gradually
improved
by
the
contemplation
of
the
excellent
qualities
of
her
generous
husband
a
lurking
suspicion
of
the
cause
of
francis
sudden
disappearance
rendered
her
uneasy
at
times
but
marian
was
too
much
beloved
too
happy
in
the
enjoyment
of
too
many
honors
and
of
too
great
wealth
to
be
open
to
the
convictions
of
conscience
it
is
in
our
hours
of
pain
and
privation
that
we
begin
to
feel
its
sting
if
we
are
prosperous
we
fancy
we
reap
the
fruits
of
our
own
merit
but
if
we
are
unfortunate
the
voice
of
truth
seldom
fails
to
remind
us
that
we
are
deserving
of
our
fate
a
blessed
provision
of
providence
that
often
makes
the
saddest
hours
of
our
earthly
career
the
morn
of
a
day
that
is
to
endure
for
ever
general
denbigh
and
lady
margaret
both
died
within
five
years
of
the
marriage
of
their
favorite
child
although
both
lived
to
see
their
descendant
in
the
person
of
the
infant
lord
lumley
the
duke
and
his
brother
george
were
each
blessed
with
offspring
and
in
these
several
descendants
of
the
different
branches
of
the
family
of
denbigh
may
be
seen
the
different
personages
of
our
history
on
the
birth
of
her
youngest
child
the
lady
marian
the
countess
of
pendennyss
sustained
a
shock
in
her
health
from
which
she
never
wholly
recovered
she
became
nervous
and
lost
most
of
her
energy
both
of
mind
and
body
her
husband
was
her
solace
his
tenderness
remaining
unextinguished
while
his
attentions
increased
as
the
fortune
of
ives
and
isabel
put
the
necessity
of
a
living
out
of
the
question
and
no
cure
offering
for
the
acceptance
of
the
first
he
was
happy
to
avail
himself
of
an
offer
to
become
domestic
chaplain
to
his
now
intimate
friend
denbigh
for
the
first
six
years
they
were
inmates
of
pendennyss
castle
the
rector
of
the
parish
was
infirm
and
averse
to
a
regular
assistant
but
the
unobtrusive
services
of
ives
were
not
less
welcome
to
the
pastor
than
to
his
parishioners
employed
in
the
duties
which
of
right
fell
to
the
incumbent
and
intrusted
with
the
spiritual
guardianship
of
the
dependants
of
the
castle
our
young
clergyman
had
ample
occupation
for
all
his
time
if
not
a
sufficient
theatre
for
his
usefulness
isabel
and
himself
remained
the
year
round
in
wales
and
the
first
dawnings
of
education
received
by
lord
lumley
were
those
he
acquired
conjointly
with
francis
from
the
care
of
the
latter
father
they
formed
with
the
interval
of
the
time
spent
by
denbigh
and
lady
pendennyss
in
town
in
winter
but
one
family
to
the
gentleman
the
attachment
of
the
grateful
ives
was
as
strong
as
it
was
lasting
ives
never
ceased
to
consider
him
as
a
victim
to
her
happiness
and
although
a
far
more
brilliant
lot
had
awaited
him
by
the
change
yet
her
own
husband
could
not
think
it
a
more
happy
one
the
birth
of
lady
marian
had
already
in
its
consequences
begun
to
throw
a
gloom
round
the
domestic
comforts
of
denbigh
when
he
was
to
sustain
another
misfortune
in
a
separation
from
his
friends
now
ives
had
early
announced
his
firm
intention
whenever
an
opportunity
was
afforded
him
to
enter
into
the
fullest
functions
of
his
ministry
as
a
matter
of
duty
such
an
opportunity
now
offered
at
b
and
the
doctor
became
its
rector
about
the
period
sir
edward
became
possessor
of
his
paternal
estate
denbigh
tried
every
inducement
within
his
power
to
keep
the
doctor
in
his
own
society
if
as
many
thousands
as
his
living
would
give
him
hundreds
could
effect
it
they
would
have
been
at
his
service
but
denbigh
understood
the
character
of
the
divine
too
well
to
offer
such
an
inducement
he
however
urged
the
claims
of
friendship
to
the
utmost
but
without
success
the
doctor
acknowledged
the
hold
both
himself
and
family
had
gained
upon
his
affections
but
he
added
consider
my
dear
denbigh
what
we
would
have
thought
of
one
of
the
earlier
followers
of
our
saviour
who
from
motives
of
convenience
or
could
have
deserted
his
sacred
calling
although
the
changes
in
the
times
may
have
rendered
the
modes
of
conducting
them
different
necessarily
the
duties
remain
the
same
the
minister
of
our
holy
religion
who
has
once
submitted
to
the
call
of
his
divine
master
must
allow
nothing
but
ungovernable
necessity
to
turn
him
from
the
path
he
has
entered
on
and
should
he
so
far
forget
himself
i
greatly
fear
he
would
plead
when
too
late
to
remedy
the
evil
his
worldly
duties
his
cares
or
even
his
misfortunes
in
vain
solemn
and
arduous
are
his
obligations
to
labor
but
when
faithfully
he
has
discharged
these
duties
oh
how
glorious
must
be
his
reward
before
such
opinions
every
barrier
must
fall
and
the
doctor
entered
into
the
cure
of
his
parish
without
further
opposition
though
not
without
unceasing
regret
on
the
part
of
his
friend
their
intercourse
was
however
maintained
by
letter
and
they
also
frequently
met
at
lumley
castle
a
seat
of
the
countess
within
two
days
ride
of
the
doctor
parish
until
her
increasing
indisposition
rendered
journeying
impossible
then
indeed
the
doctor
extended
his
rides
into
wales
but
with
longer
intervals
between
his
visits
though
with
the
happiest
effects
to
the
objects

sweet

distinct

through
it
and
there
in
a
kind
of
shed
to
the
building
which
hardly
sheltered
him
from
the
fury
of
the
tempest
clad
in
the
garments
of
the
extremest
poverty
with
an
eye
roving
in
madness
and
a
body
rocking
to
and
fro
from
mental
inquietude
he
beheld
seated
on
a
stone
the
remains
of
his
long
lost
brother
francis
the
language
of
the
song
was
too
plain
to
be
misunderstood
the
truth
glared
around
george
with
a
violence
that
dazzled
his
brain
but
he
saw
it
all
he
felt
it
all
and
rushing
to
the
feet
of
his
brother
he
exclaimed
in
horror
pressing
his
hands
between
his
own
francis
my
own
brother
do
you
not
know
me
the
maniac
regarded
him
with
a
vacant
gaze
but
the
voice
and
the
person
recalled
the
compositions
of
his
more
reasonable
moments
to
his
recollection
pushing
back
the
hair
of
george
so
as
to
expose
his
fine
forehead
to
view
he
contemplated
him
for
a
few
moments
and
then
continued
to
sing
in
a
voice
still
rendered
sweeter
than
before
by
his
faint
impressions
his
raven
locks
that
richly
curled
his
eye
that
proud
defiance
hurled
have
my
marian
love
had
i
been
blest
by
grace
with
such
a
form
with
such
a
face
could
i
so
treacherous
prove
and
what
is
man
and
what
is
care
that
he
should
let
such
passions
tear
the
bases
of
the
soul
oh
you
should
do
as
i
have
done
and
having
pleasure
summit
won
each
bursting
sob
control
on
ending
the
last
stanza
the
maniac
released
his
brother
and
broke
into
the
wildest
laugh
of
madness
francis
oh
francis
my
brother
cried
george
in
bitterness
a
piercing
shriek
drew
his
eye
to
the
door
he
had
passed
through
on
its
threshold
lay
the
senseless
body
of
his
wife
the
distracted
husband
forgot
everything
in
the
situation
of
his
marian
and
raising
her
in
his
arms
he
exclaimed
marian
my
marian
revive
look
up
know
me
francis
had
followed
him
and
now
stood
by
his
side
gazing
intently
on
the
lifeless
body
his
looks
became
more
soft
his
eye
glanced
less
wildly
he
too
cried
marian
my
marian
there
was
a
mighty
effort
nature
could
endure
no
more
he
broke
a
and
fell
at
the
feet
of
george
they
flew
to
his
assistance
giving
the
countess
to
her
women
but
he
was
dead
for
seventeen
years
lady
pendennyss
survived
this
shock
but
having
reached
her
own
abode
during
that
long
period
she
never
left
her
room
in
the
confidence
of
his
surviving
hopes
doctor
ives
and
his
wife
were
made
acquainted
with
the
real
cause
of
the
grief
of
their
friend
but
the
truth
went
no
further
denbigh
was
the
guardian
of
his
three
young
cousins
the
duke
his
sister
and
young
george
denbigh
these
with
his
son
lord
lumley
and
daughter
lady
marian
were
removed
from
the
melancholy
of
the
castle
to
scenes
better
adapted
to
their
opening
prospects
in
life
yet
lumley
was
fond
of
the
society
of
his
father
and
finding
him
a
youth
endowed
beyond
his
years
the
care
of
his
parent
was
early
turned
to
the
most
important
of
his
duties
in
that
sacred
office
and
when
he
yielded
to
his
wishes
to
go
into
the
army
he
knew
he
went
a
youth
of
sixteen
possessed
of
principles
and
that
would
become
a
man
of
general
wilson
completed
the
work
which
the
father
had
begun
and
lord
lumley
formed
a
singular
exception
to
the
character
of
most
of
his
companions
at
the
close
of
the
spanish
war
he
returned
home
and
was
just
in
time
to
receive
the
parting
breath
of
his
mother
a
few
days
before
her
death
the
countess
requested
that
her
children
might
be
made
acquainted
with
her
history
and
misconduct
and
she
placed
in
the
hands
of
her
son
a
letter
with
directions
for
him
to
open
it
after
her
decease
it
was
addressed
to
both
children
and
after
recapitulating
generally
the
principal
events
of
her
life
continued
thus
my
children
you
perceive
the
consequences
of
indulgence
and
hardness
of
heart
which
made
me
insensible
to
the
sufferings
of
others
and
regardless
of
the
plainest
dictates
of
justice
self
was
my
idol
the
love
of
admiration
which
was
natural
to
me
was
increased
by
the
flatterers
who
surrounded
me
and
had
the
customs
of
our
country
suffered
royalty
to
descend
in
their
unions
to
a
grade
in
life
below
their
own
your
uncle
would
have
escaped
the
fangs
of
my
baneful
coquetry
oh
marian
my
child
never
descend
so
low
as
to
practise
those
arts
which
have
degraded
your
unhappy
mother
i
would
impress
on
you
as
a
memorial
of
my
parting
affection
these
simple
truths
that
coquetry
stands
next
to
the
want
of
chastity
in
the
scale
of
female
vices
it
is
in
fact
a
kind
of
mental
prostitution
it
is
ruinous
to
all
that
delicacy
of
feeling
which
gives
added
lustre
to
female
charms
it
is
almost
destructive
to
modesty
itself
a
woman
who
has
been
addicted
to
its
practice
may
strive
long
and
in
vain
to
regain
that
singleness
of
heart
which
can
bind
her
up
so
closely
in
her
husband
and
children
as
to
make
her
a
good
wife
or
a
mother
and
if
it
should
have
degenerated
into
habit
it
may
lead
to
the
awful
result
of
infidelity
to
her
marriage
vows
it
is
vain
for
a
coquette
to
pretend
to
religion
its
practice
involves
hypocrisy
falsehood
and
deception
everything
that
is
mean
everything
that
is
debasing
in
short
as
it
is
bottomed
on
selfishness
and
pride
where
it
has
once
possessed
the
mind
it
will
only
yield
to
the
displaying
banners
of
the
cross
this
and
this
only
can
remove
the
evil
for
without
it
she
whom
the
charms
of
youth
and
beauty
have
enabled
to
act
the
coquette
will
descend
into
the
vale
of
life
altered
it
is
true
but
not
amended
she
will
find
the
world
with
its
allurements
clinging
around
her
parting
years
in
vain
regrets
for
days
that
are
flown
and
in
mercenary
views
for
her
descendants
heaven
bless
you
my
children
console
and
esteem
your
inestimable
father
while
he
yet
remains
with
you
and
place
your
reliance
on
that
heavenly
parent
who
will
never
desert
those
who
seek
him
in
sincerity
and
love
your
dying
mother
m
pendennyss
this
letter
evidently
written
under
the
excitement
of
deep
remorse
made
a
great
impression
on
both
her
children
in
lady
marian
it
was
pity
regret
and
abhorrence
of
the
fault
which
had
been
the
principal
cause
of
the
wreck
of
her
mother
peace
of
mind
but
in
her
brother
now
earl
of
pendennyss
these
feelings
were
united
with
a
jealous
dread
of
his
own
probable
lot
in
the
chances
of
matrimony
his
uncle
had
been
the
supposed
heir
to
a
more
elevated
title
than
his
own
but
he
was
now
the
actual
possessor
of
as
honorable
a
name
and
of
much
larger
revenues
the
great
wealth
of
his
maternal
grandfather
and
the
considerable
estate
of
his
own
father
were
or
would
soon
be
centred
in
himself
and
if
a
woman
as
amiable
as
faultless
as
affection
had
taught
him
to
believe
his
mother
to
be
could
yield
in
her
situation
to
the
lure
of
worldly
honors
had
he
not
great
reason
to
dread
that
a
hand
might
be
bestowed
at
some
day
upon
himself
when
the
heart
would
point
out
some
other
destination
if
the
real
wishes
of
its
owner
were
consulted
pendennyss
was
modest
by
nature
and
humble
from
principle
though
by
no
means
distrustful
yet
the
shock
of
discovering
his
mother
fault
the
gloom
occasioned
by
her
death
and
his
father
declining
health
sometimes
led
him
into
a
train
of
reflections
which
at
others
he
would
have
fervently
deprecated
a
short
time
after
the
decease
of
the
countess
denbigh
finding
his
constitution
fast
giving
way
under
the
wasting
of
a
decline
he
had
been
in
for
a
year
resolved
to
finish
his
days
in
the
abode
of
his
christian
friend
doctor
ives
for
several
years
they
had
not
met
increasing
duties
and
infirmities
on
both
sides
having
interrupted
their
visits
by
easy
stages
he
left
the
residence
of
his
son
in
wales
and
accompanied
by
both
his
children
he
reached
lumley
castle
much
exhausted
here
he
took
a
solemn
and
final
leave
of
marian
unwilling
that
she
should
so
soon
witness
again
the
death
of
another
parent
and
dismissing
the
earl
equipage
and
attendants
a
short
day
ride
from
they
proceeded
alone
to
the
rectory
a
letter
had
been
forwarded
acquainting
the
doctor
of
his
approaching
visit
wishing
it
to
be
perfectly
private
but
not
alluding
to
its
object
and
naming
a
day
a
week
later
than
the
one
on
which
he
arrived
this
plan
was
altered
on
perceiving
the
torch
of
life
more
rapidly
approaching
the
socket
than
he
had
at
first
supposed
his
unexpected
appearance
and
reception
are
known
denbigh
death
and
the
departure
of
his
son
followed
francis
having
been
pendennyss
companion
to
the
tomb
of
his
ancestors
in
westmoreland
the
earl
had
a
shrinking
delicacy
under
the
knowledge
of
his
family
history
that
made
him
anxious
to
draw
all
eyes
from
the
contemplation
of
his
mother
conduct
how
far
the
knowledge
of
it
had
extended
in
society
he
could
not
know
but
he
wished
it
buried
with
her
in
the
tomb
the
peculiar
manner
of
his
father
death
would
attract
notice
and
might
recall
attention
to
the
prime
cause
of
his
disorder
as
yet
all
was
veiled
and
he
wished
the
doctor
family
to
let
it
remain
so
it
was
however
impossible
that
the
death
of
a
man
of
denbigh
rank
should
be
unnoticed
in
the
prints
and
the
care
of
francis
dictated
the
simple
truth
without
comments
as
it
appeared
as
regarded
the
moseleys
what
was
more
natural
than
that
the
son
of
denbigh
should
also
be
denbigh
in
the
presence
of
the
rector
family
no
allusions
were
made
to
their
friends
and
the
villagers
and
the
neighborhood
spoke
of
them
as
old
and
young
denbigh
the
name
of
lord
lumley
now
earl
of
pendennyss
was
known
to
the
whole
british
nation
but
the
long
retirement
of
his
father
and
mother
had
driven
them
almost
from
the
recollection
of
their
friends
even
wilson
supposed
her
favorite
hero
a
lumley
pendennyss
castle
had
been
for
centuries
the
proud
residence
of
that
family
and
the
change
of
name
in
its
possessor
was
forgotten
with
the
circumstances
that
had
led
to
it
when
therefore
emily
met
the
earl
so
unexpectedly
the
second
time
at
the
rectory
she
of
course
with
all
her
companions
spoke
of
him
as
denbigh
on
that
occasion
pendennyss
had
called
in
person
in
expectation
of
meeting
his
kinsman
lord
bolton
but
finding
him
absent
he
could
not
resist
his
desire
to
visit
the
rectory
accordingly
he
sent
his
carriage
and
servants
on
to
london
leaving
them
at
a
convenient
spot
and
arrived
on
foot
at
the
house
of
ives
from
the
same
motives
which
had
influenced
him
before
a
wish
to
indulge
undisturbed
by
useless
ceremony
his
melancholy
reflections
he
desired
that
his
name
might
not
be
mentioned
this
was
an
easy
task
both
doctor
and
ives
had
called
him
when
a
child
george
or
lumley
and
were
unused
to
his
new
appellation
of
pendennyss
indeed
it
rather
recalled
painful
recollections
to
them
all
it
may
be
remembered
that
circumstances
removed
the
necessity
of
any
introduction
to
wilson
and
her
party
and
the
difficulty
in
that
instance
was
happily
got
rid
of
the
earl
had
often
heard
emily
moseley
spoken
of
by
his
friends
and
in
their
letters
they
frequently
mentioned
her
name
as
connected
with
their
pleasures
and
employments
and
always
with
an
affection
pendennyss
thought
exceeding
that
which
they
manifested
for
their
son
wife
and
mrs
ives
the
evening
before
to
remove
unpleasant
thoughts
had
given
him
a
lively
description
of
her
person
and
character
the
curiosity
had
been
a
little
excited
to
see
this
paragon
of
female
beauty
and
virtue
and
unlike
most
curiosity
on
such
subjects
he
was
agreeably
disappointed
by
the
examination
he
wished
to
know
more
and
made
interest
with
the
doctor
to
assist
him
to
continue
the
incognito
with
which
accident
had
favored
him
the
doctor
objected
on
the
ground
of
principle
and
the
earl
desisted
but
the
beauty
of
emily
aided
by
her
character
had
made
an
impression
not
to
be
easily
shaken
off
and
pendennyss
returned
to
the
charge
his
former
jealousies
were
awakened
in
proportion
to
his
admiration
and
after
some
time
he
threw
himself
on
the
mercy
of
the
divine
by
declaring
his
new
motive
but
without
mentioning
his
parents
the
doctor
pitied
him
for
he
scanned
his
feelings
thoroughly
and
consented
to
keep
silent
but
laughingly
declared
it
was
bad
enough
for
a
divine
to
be
accessory
to
much
less
aiding
in
a
deception
and
that
he
knew
if
emily
and
wilson
learnt
his
imposition
he
would
lose
ground
in
their
favor
by
the
discovery
surely
george
said
the
doctor
with
a
laugh
you
do
mean
to
marry
the
young
lady
as
mr
denbigh
oh
no
it
is
too
soon
to
think
of
marrying
her
at
all
replied
the
earl
with
a
smile
but
somehow
i
should
like
to
see
what
my
reception
in
the
world
will
be
as
plain
denbigh
unprovided
for
and
unknown
no
doubt
my
lord
said
the
rector
archly
in
proportion
to
your
merits
very
unfavorably
indeed
but
then
your
humility
will
be
finally
elevated
by
the
occasional
praises
i
have
heard
wilson
lavish
on
your
proper
character
of
late
i
am
much
indebted
to
her
partiality
continued
the
earl
mournfully
then
throwing
off
his
gloomy
thoughts
he
added
i
wonder
my
dear
doctor
your
goodness
did
not
set
her
right
in
the
latter
particular
why
she
has
hardly
given
me
an
opportunity
delicacy
and
my
own
feelings
have
kept
me
very
silent
on
the
subject
of
your
family
to
any
of
that
connexion
they
think
i
believe
i
was
a
rector
in
wales
instead
of
your
father
chaplain
and
somehow
continued
the
doctor
smiling
on
his
wife
the
association
with
your
late
parents
was
so
connected
in
my
mind
with
my
most
romantic
feelings
that
although
i
have
delighted
in
it
i
have
seldom
alluded
to
it
in
conversation
at
all
wilson
has
spoken
of
you
but
twice
in
my
hearing
and
that
since
she
has
expected
to
meet
you
your
name
has
doubtless
recalled
the
remembrance
of
her
husband
i
have
many
many
reasons
to
remember
the
general
with
gratitude
cried
the
earl
with
fervor
but
doctor
do
not
forget
my
incognito
only
call
me
george
i
ask
no
more
the
plan
of
pendennyss
was
put
in
execution
day
after
day
he
lingered
in
northamptonshire
until
his
principles
and
character
had
grown
upon
the
esteem
of
the
moseleys
in
the
manner
we
have
mentioned
his
frequent
embarrassments
were
from
the
dread
and
shame
of
a
detection
with
sir
herbert
nicholson
he
had
a
narrow
escape
and
fitzgerald
and
lord
henry
stapleton
he
of
course
avoided
for
having
gone
so
far
he
was
determined
to
persevere
to
the
end
egerton
he
thought
knew
him
and
he
disliked
his
character
and
manners
when
chatterton
appeared
most
attentive
to
emily
the
candor
and
good
opinion
of
that
young
nobleman
made
the
earl
acquainted
with
his
wishes
and
his
situation
pendennyss
was
too
generous
not
to
meet
his
rival
on
fair
grounds
his
cousin
and
the
duke
were
requested
to
use
their
united
influence
secretly
to
obtain
the
desired
station
for
the
baron
the
result
is
known
and
pendennyss
trusted
his
secret
to
chatterton
he
took
him
to
london
gave
him
in
charge
to
derwent
and
returned
to
prosecute
his
own
suit
his
note
from
bolton
castle
was
a
ruse
to
conceal
his
character
as
he
knew
the
departure
of
the
baronet
family
to
an
hour
and
had
so
timed
his
visit
to
the
earl
as
not
to
come
in
collision
with
the
moseleys
indeed
my
lord
cried
the
doctor
to
him
one
day
your
scheme
goes
on
swimmingly
and
i
am
only
afraid
when
your
mistress
discovers
the
imposition
you
will
find
your
rank
producing
a
different
effect
from
what
you
have
apprehended
chapter
xlvi
but
ives
was
mistaken
had
he
seen
the
sparkling
eyes
and
glowing
cheeks
of
miss
moseley
the
smile
of
satisfaction
and
happiness
which
played
on
the
usually
thoughtful
face
of
wilson
when
the
earl
handed
them
into
his
own
carriage
as
they
left
his
house
on
the
evening
of
the
discovery
the
doctor
would
have
gladly
acknowledged
the
failure
of
his
prognostics
in
truth
there
was
no
possible
event
that
under
the
circumstances
could
have
given
both
aunt
and
niece
such
heartfelt
pleasure
as
the
knowledge
that
denbigh
and
the
earl
were
the
same
person
pendennyss
stood
holding
the
door
of
the
carriage
in
his
hand
irresolute
how
to
act
when
wilson
said
surely
my
lord
you
sup
with
us
a
thousand
thanks
my
dear
madam
for
the
privilege
cried
the
earl
as
he
sprang
into
the
coach
the
door
was
closed
and
they
drove
off
after
the
explanations
of
this
morning
my
lord
said
wilson
willing
to
remove
all
doubts
between
him
and
emily
and
perhaps
anxious
to
satisfy
her
own
curiosity
it
will
be
fastidious
to
conceal
our
desire
to
know
more
of
your
movements
how
came
your
in
the
possession
of
mrs
fitzgerald
mrs
fitzgerald
cried
pendennyss
in
astonishment
i
lost
the
book
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
lodge
and
supposed
it
had
fallen
into
your
hands
and
betrayed
my
disguise
by
emily
rejection
of
me
and
your
own
altered
eye
was
i
mistaken
then
in
both
wilson
now
for
the
first
time
explained
their
real
grounds
for
refusing
his
offers
which
in
the
morning
she
had
loosely
mentioned
as
owing
to
a
misapprehension
of
his
just
character
and
recounted
the
manner
of
the
book
falling
into
the
hands
of
fitzgerald
the
earl
listened
in
amazement
and
after
musing
with
himself
exclaimed
i
remember
taking
it
from
my
pocket
to
show
colonel
egerton
some
singular
plants
i
had
gathered
and
think
i
first
missed
it
when
returning
to
the
place
where
i
had
then
laid
it
in
some
of
the
pockets
were
letters
from
marian
addressed
to
me
properly
and
i
naturally
thought
they
had
met
your
eye
wilson
and
emily
immediately
thought
egerton
the
real
villain
who
had
caused
both
themselves
and
fitzgerald
so
much
uneasiness
and
the
former
mentioned
her
suspicions
to
the
earl
nothing
more
probable
dear
madam
cried
he
and
this
explains
to
me
his
startled
looks
when
we
first
met
and
his
evident
dislike
to
my
society
for
he
must
have
seen
my
person
though
the
carriage
hid
him
from
my
sight
that
egerton
was
the
wretch
and
that
through
his
agency
the
had
been
carried
to
the
cottage
they
all
now
agreed
and
turned
to
more
pleasant
subjects
master
here
master
said
peter
johnson
as
he
stood
at
a
window
of
benfield
room
stirring
a
gruel
for
the
old
gentleman
supper
and
stretching
his
neck
and
straining
his
eyes
to
distinguish
objects
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
i
do
think
there
is
denbigh
handing
miss
emmy
from
a
coach
covered
with
gold
and
two
footmen
all
dizened
with
pride
like
the
spoon
fell
from
the
hands
of
benfield
he
rose
briskly
from
his
seat
and
adjusting
his
dress
took
the
arm
of
the
steward
and
proceeded
to
the
while
these
several
movements
were
in
operation
which
consumed
some
time
the
old
bachelor
relieved
the
tedium
of
peter
impatience
by
the
following
speech
mr
denbigh
what
back
i
thought
he
never
could
let
that
rascal
john
shoot
him
and
forsake
emmy
after
all
here
the
old
gentleman
suddenly
recollected
denbigh
marriage
but
now
peter
it
can
do
no
good
i
remember
that
when
my
friend
the
earl
of
gosford
and
again
he
was
checked
by
the
image
of
the
and
the
viscountess
but
peter
he
said
with
great
warmth
we
can
go
down
and
see
him
notwithstanding
mr
denbigh
exclaimed
sir
edward
in
astonishment
when
he
saw
the
companion
of
his
sister
and
child
enter
the
you
are
welcome
once
more
to
your
old
friends
your
sudden
retreat
from
us
gave
us
much
pain
but
we
suppose
lady
laura
had
too
many
attractions
to
allow
us
to
keep
you
any
longer
in
norfolk
the
good
baronet
sighed
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
man
whom
he
had
once
hoped
to
receive
as
a
son
neither
lady
laura
nor
any
other
lady
my
dear
sir
edward
cried
the
earl
as
he
took
the
baronet
hand
drove
me
from
you
but
the
frowns
of
your
own
fair
daughter
and
here
she
is
ready
to
acknowledge
her
offence
and
i
hope
to
atone
for
it
john
who
knew
of
the
refusal
of
his
sister
and
was
not
a
little
displeased
with
the
cavalier
treatment
he
had
received
at
hands
felt
indignant
at
such
improper
levity
in
a
married
man
and
approached
with
your
servant
denbigh
i
hope
my
lady
laura
is
well
pendennyss
understood
his
look
and
replied
very
gravely
your
servant
john
moseley
my
lady
laura
is
or
certainly
ought
to
be
very
well
as
she
has
this
moment
gone
to
a
rout
accompanied
by
her
husband
the
quick
eye
of
john
glanced
from
the
earl
to
his
aunt
to
emily
a
lurking
smile
was
on
all
their
features
the
heightened
color
of
his
sister
the
flashing
eyes
of
the
young
nobleman
the
face
of
his
aunt
all
told
him
that
something
uncommon
was
about
to
be
explained
and
yielding
to
his
feelings
he
caught
the
hand
which
pendennyss
extended
to
him
and
cried
denbigh
i
see
i
feel
there
is
some
unaccountable
mistake
we
are
brothers
said
the
earl
emphatically
sir
edward
dear
lady
moseley
i
throw
myself
on
your
mercy
i
am
an
impostor
when
your
hospitality
received
me
into
your
house
it
is
true
you
admitted
george
denbigh
but
he
is
better
known
as
the
earl
of
pendennyss
the
earl
of
pendennyss
exclaimed
lady
moseley
in
a
glow
of
delight
as
she
saw
at
once
through
some
juvenile
folly
a
deception
which
promised
both
happiness
and
rank
to
one
of
her
children
is
it
possible
my
dear
charlotte
that
this
is
your
unknown
friend
the
very
same
anne
replied
the
smiling
widow
and
guilty
of
a
folly
that
at
all
events
removes
the
distance
between
us
a
little
by
showing
that
he
is
subject
to
the
failings
of
mortality
but
the
masquerade
is
ended
and
i
hope
you
and
edward
will
not
only
treat
him
as
an
earl
but
receive
him
as
a
son
most
willingly
most
willingly
cried
the
baronet
with
great
energy
be
he
prince
peer
or
beggar
he
is
the
preserver
of
my
child
and
as
such
he
is
always
welcome
the
door
now
slowly
opened
and
the
venerable
bachelor
appeared
on
its
threshold
pendennyss
who
had
never
forgotten
the
good
will
manifested
to
him
by
benfield
met
him
with
a
look
of
pleasure
as
he
expressed
his
happiness
at
seeing
him
again
in
london
i
never
have
forgotten
your
goodness
in
sending
honest
peter
such
a
distance
from
home
on
the
object
of
his
visit
i
now
regret
that
a
feeling
of
shame
occasioned
my
answering
your
kindness
so
laconically
turning
to
wilson
he
added
for
a
time
i
knew
not
how
to
write
a
letter
even
being
afraid
to
sign
my
proper
appellation
and
ashamed
to
use
my
adopted
denbigh
i
am
happy
to
see
you
i
did
send
peter
it
is
true
to
london
on
a
message
to
you
but
it
is
all
over
now
the
old
man
sighed
peter
however
escaped
the
snares
of
this
wicked
place
and
if
you
are
happy
i
am
content
i
remember
when
the
earl
of
pendennyss
exclaimed
the
other
imposed
on
the
hospitality
of
a
worthy
man
under
an
assumed
appellation
in
order
to
pry
into
the
character
of
a
lovely
female
who
was
only
too
good
for
him
and
who
now
is
willing
to
forget
his
follies
and
make
him
not
only
the
happiest
of
men
but
the
nephew
of
mr
benfield
during
this
speech
the
countenance
of
benfield
had
manifested
evident
emotion
he
looked
from
one
to
another
until
he
saw
wilson
smiling
near
him
pointing
to
the
earl
with
his
finger
he
stood
unable
to
speak
as
she
answered
simply
lord
pendennyss
and
emmy
dear
will
you
will
you
marry
him
cried
benfield
suppressing
his
feelings
to
give
utterance
to
his
question
emily
felt
for
her
uncle
and
blushing
deeply
with
great
frankness
she
put
her
hand
in
that
of
the
earl
who
pressed
it
with
rapture
again
and
again
to
his
lips
benfield
sank
into
a
chair
and
with
a
heart
softened
by
emotion
burst
into
tears
peter
he
cried
struggling
with
his
feelings
i
am
now
ready
to
depart
in
peace
i
shall
see
my
darling
emmy
happy
and
to
her
care
i
shall
commit
you
emily
deeply
affected
with
his
love
threw
herself
into
his
arms
in
a
torrent
of
tears
and
was
removed
from
them
by
pendennyss
in
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
both
jane
felt
no
emotions
of
envy
for
her
sister
happiness
on
the
contrary
she
rejoiced
in
common
with
the
rest
of
their
friends
in
her
brightening
prospects
and
they
all
took
their
seats
at
the
supper
table
as
happy
a
group
as
was
contained
in
the
wide
circle
of
the
metropolis
a
few
more
particulars
served
to
explain
the
mystery
sufficiently
until
a
more
fitting
opportunity
made
them
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
the
earl
proceedings
my
lord
pendennyss
said
sir
edward
pouring
out
a
glass
of
wine
and
passing
the
bottle
to
his
neighbor
i
drink
your
health
and
happiness
to
yourself
and
my
darling
child
the
toast
was
drunk
by
all
the
family
and
the
earl
replied
to
the
compliments
with
his
thanks
and
smiles
while
emily
could
only
notice
them
with
her
blushes
and
tears
but
this
was
an
opportunity
not
to
be
lost
by
the
honest
steward
who
from
affection
and
long
services
had
been
indulged
in
familiarities
exceeding
any
other
of
his
master
establishment
he
very
deliberately
helped
himself
to
a
glass
of
wine
and
drawing
near
the
seat
of
the
with
an
humble
reverence
commenced
his
speech
as
follows
my
dear
miss
emmy
here
hoping
you
live
to
be
a
comfort
to
your
honored
father
and
your
honored
mother
and
my
dear
honored
master
and
yourself
and
madam
wilson
the
steward
paused
to
clear
his
voice
and
profited
by
the
delay
to
cast
his
eye
round
the
table
to
collect
the
names
and
john
moseley
and
sweet
moseley
and
pretty
miss
jane
peter
had
lived
too
long
in
the
world
to
compliment
one
handsome
woman
in
the
presence
of
another
without
the
qualifying
his
speech
a
little
and
lord
denbigh
earl
like
as
they
say
he
now
is
and
peter
stopped
a
moment
to
deliberate
and
then
making
another
reference
he
put
the
glass
to
his
lips
but
before
he
had
got
half
through
its
contents
recollected
himself
and
replenishing
it
to
the
brim
with
a
smile
acknowledging
his
forgetfulness
continued
and
the
rev
francis
ives
and
the
rev
francis
ives
here
the
unrestrained
laugh
of
john
interrupted
him
and
considering
with
himself
that
he
had
included
the
whole
family
he
finished
his
bumper
whether
it
was
pleasure
at
his
own
eloquence
in
venturing
on
so
long
a
speech
or
the
unusual
allowance
that
affected
the
steward
he
was
evidently
much
satisfied
with
himself
and
stepped
back
behind
his
master
chair
in
great
good
humor
emily
as
she
thanked
him
noticed
a
tear
in
the
eye
of
the
old
man
as
he
concluded
his
oration
that
would
have
excused
a
thousand
breaches
of
fastidious
ceremony
but
pendennyss
rose
from
his
seat
and
took
him
kindly
by
the
hand
and
returned
his
own
thanks
for
his
good
wishes
i
owe
you
much
good
will
johnson
for
your
two
journeys
in
my
behalf
and
trust
i
never
shall
forget
the
manner
in
which
you
executed
your
last
mission
in
particular
we
are
friends
i
trust
for
life
thank
you
thank
your
honor
lordship
said
the
steward
almost
unable
to
utter
i
hope
you
may
live
long
to
make
dear
little
miss
emmy
as
happy
as
i
know
she
ought
to
be
but
really
my
lord
cried
john
observing
that
the
affection
for
his
sister
had
affected
her
to
tears
it
was
a
singular
circumstance
the
meeting
of
the
four
passengers
of
the
stage
so
soon
at
your
hotel
moseley
explained
his
meaning
to
the
rest
of
the
company
not
so
much
so
as
you
imagine
said
the
earl
in
reply
yourself
and
johnson
were
in
quest
of
me
lord
henry
stapleton
was
under
an
engagement
to
meet
me
that
evening
at
the
hotel
as
we
were
both
going
to
his
sister
wedding
i
having
arranged
the
thing
with
him
by
letter
previously
and
general
was
also
in
search
of
me
on
business
relating
to
his
niece
the
donna
julia
he
had
been
to
annerdale
house
and
through
my
servants
heard
i
was
at
an
hotel
it
was
the
first
interview
between
us
and
not
quite
as
amicable
a
one
as
has
since
been
had
in
wales
during
my
service
in
spain
i
saw
the
conde
but
not
the
general
the
letter
he
gave
me
was
from
the
spanish
ambassador
claiming
a
right
to
require
fitzgerald
from
our
government
and
deprecating
my
using
an
influence
to
counteract
his
exertions
which
you
refused
said
emily
eagerly
not
refused
answered
the
earl
smiling
at
her
warmth
while
he
admired
her
friendly
zeal
for
it
was
unnecessary
there
is
no
such
power
vested
in
the
ministry
but
i
explicitly
told
the
general
i
would
oppose
any
violent
measures
to
restore
her
to
her
country
and
a
convent
from
the
courts
i
apprehended
nothing
for
my
fair
friend
your
honor
my
lord
said
peter
who
had
been
listening
with
great
attention
if
i
may
presume
just
to
ask
two
questions
without
offence
say
on
my
good
friend
said
pendennyss
with
an
encouraging
smile
only
continued
the
steward
hemming
to
give
proper
utterance
to
his
thoughts
i
wish
to
know
whether
you
stayed
in
that
same
street
after
you
left
the
hotel
for
john
moseley
and
i
had
a
slight
difference
in
opinion
about
it
the
earl
smiled
having
caught
the
arch
expression
of
john
and
i
believe
i
owe
you
an
apology
moseley
for
my
cavalier
treatment
but
guilt
makes
us
all
cowards
i
found
you
were
ignorant
of
my
incognito
and
i
was
equally
ashamed
to
continue
it
or
to
become
the
relater
of
my
own
folly
indeed
he
continued
smiling
on
emily
as
he
spoke
i
thought
your
sister
had
pronounced
the
opinion
of
all
reflecting
people
on
my
conduct
i
went
out
of
town
johnson
at
what
is
the
other
query
why
my
lord
said
peter
a
little
disappointed
at
finding
his
first
surmise
untrue
that
outlandish
tongue
your
honor
used
was
spanish
cried
the
earl
and
not
greek
peter
said
his
master
gravely
i
thought
from
the
words
you
endeavored
to
repeat
to
me
that
you
had
made
a
mistake
you
need
not
be
disconcerted
however
for
i
know
several
members
of
the
parliament
of
this
realm
who
could
not
talk
the
greek
language
that
is
fluently
so
it
can
be
no
disgrace
to
a
to
be
ignorant
of
it
somewhat
consoled
to
find
himself
as
well
off
as
the
representatives
of
his
country
peter
resumed
his
station
in
silence
when
the
carriages
began
to
announce
the
return
from
the
opera
the
earl
took
his
leave
and
the
party
retired
to
rest
the
thanksgivings
of
emily
that
night
ere
she
laid
her
head
on
her
pillow
were
the
purest
offering
of
mortal
innocence
the
prospect
before
her
was
unsullied
by
a
cloud
and
she
poured
out
her
heart
in
the
fullest
confidence
of
pious
love
and
heartfelt
gratitude
as
early
on
the
succeeding
morning
as
would
allow
and
much
earlier
than
the
hour
sanctioned
by
fashion
the
earl
and
lady
marian
stopped
in
the
carriage
of
the
latter
at
the
door
of
sir
edward
moseley
their
reception
was
the
most
flattering
that
could
be
offered
to
people
of
their
stamp
sincere
cordial
and
with
a
trifling
exception
in
lady
moseley
unfettered
with
any
useless
ceremonies
emily
felt
herself
drawn
to
her
new
acquaintance
with
a
fondness
which
doubtless
grew
out
of
her
situation
with
her
brother
which
soon
found
reasons
enough
in
the
soft
and
sincere
manners
of
lady
marian
to
justify
her
attachment
on
her
own
account
there
was
a
very
handsome
suite
of
in
sir
edward
house
and
the
communicating
doors
were
carelessly
open
curiosity
to
view
the
furniture
or
some
such
trifling
reasons
induced
the
earl
to
find
his
way
into
the
one
adjoining
that
in
which
the
family
were
seated
it
was
unquestionably
a
dread
of
being
lost
in
a
strange
house
that
induced
him
to
whisper
a
request
to
the
blushing
emily
to
be
his
companion
and
lastly
it
must
have
been
nothing
but
a
knowledge
that
a
vacant
room
was
easier
viewed
than
one
filled
with
company
that
prevented
any
one
from
following
them
john
smiled
archly
at
grace
doubtless
in
approbation
of
the
comfortable
time
his
friend
was
likely
to
enjoy
in
his
musings
on
the
taste
of
their
mother
how
the
door
became
shut
we
have
ever
been
at
a
loss
to
imagine
the
company
without
were
too
and
well
satisfied
with
each
other
to
miss
the
absentees
until
the
figure
of
the
earl
appeared
at
the
reopened
door
beckoning
with
a
face
of
rapture
to
lady
moseley
and
wilson
sir
edward
next
disappeared
then
jane
then
grace
then
marian
until
john
began
to
think
a
with
benfield
was
to
be
his
morning
amusement
the
lovely
countenance
of
his
wife
however
soon
relieved
his
ennui
and
john
curiosity
was
gratified
by
an
order
to
prepare
for
his
sister
wedding
the
following
week
emily
might
have
blushed
more
than
common
during
this
interview
but
it
is
certain
she
did
not
smile
less
and
the
earl
lady
marian
assured
sir
edward
was
so
very
different
a
creature
from
what
he
had
recently
been
that
she
could
hardly
think
it
was
the
same
sombre
gentleman
with
whom
she
had
passed
the
last
few
months
in
wales
and
westmoreland
a
messenger
was
dispatched
for
ives
and
their
friends
at
b
to
be
witnesses
to
the
approaching
nuptials
and
lady
moseley
at
length
found
an
opportunity
of
indulging
her
taste
for
splendor
on
this
joyful
occasion
money
was
no
consideration
and
benfield
absolutely
pined
at
the
thought
that
the
great
wealth
of
the
earl
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
contribute
in
any
manner
to
the
comfort
of
his
emmy
however
a
fifteenth
codicil
was
framed
by
the
ingenuity
of
peter
and
his
master
and
if
it
did
not
contain
the
name
of
george
denbigh
it
did
that
of
his
expected
second
son
roderick
benfield
denbigh
to
the
qualifying
circumstance
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
as
a
bribe
for
the
name
and
a
very
pretty
child
i
dare
say
it
will
be
said
the
steward
as
he
placed
the
paper
in
its
repository
i
do
know
that
i
ever
saw
your
honor
a
couple
that
i
thought
would
make
a
handsomer
pair
like
except
peter
mind
dwelt
on
his
own
youthful
form
coupled
with
the
smiling
graces
of
patty
steele
yes
they
are
as
handsome
as
they
are
good
replied
his
master
i
remember
now
when
our
speaker
took
his
third
wife
the
world
said
that
they
were
as
pretty
a
couple
as
there
was
at
court
but
my
emma
and
the
earl
will
be
a
much
finer
pair
oh
peter
johnson
they
are
young
and
rich
and
beloved
but
after
all
it
avails
but
little
if
they
be
not
good
good
cried
the
steward
in
astonishment
they
are
as
good
as
angels
the
master
ideas
of
human
excellence
had
suffered
a
heavy
blow
in
the
view
of
his
viscountess
but
he
answered
mildly
as
good
as
mankind
can
well
be
chapter
xlvii
the
warm
weather
had
now
commenced
and
sir
edward
unwilling
to
be
shut
up
in
london
at
a
time
the
appearance
of
vegetation
gave
the
country
a
new
interest
and
accustomed
for
many
years
of
his
life
to
devote
an
hour
in
his
garden
each
morn
had
taken
a
little
ready
furnished
cottage
a
short
ride
from
his
residence
with
the
intention
of
frequenting
it
until
after
the
birthday
thither
then
pendennyss
took
his
bride
from
the
altar
and
a
few
days
were
passed
by
the
newly
married
pair
in
this
little
asylum
doctor
ives
with
francis
clara
and
their
mother
had
obeyed
the
summons
with
an
alacrity
in
proportion
to
the
joy
they
felt
on
receiving
it
and
the
former
had
the
happiness
of
officiating
on
the
occasion
it
would
have
been
easy
for
the
wealth
of
the
earl
to
procure
a
license
to
enable
them
to
marry
in
the
the
permission
was
obtained
but
neither
emily
nor
himself
felt
a
wish
to
utter
their
vows
in
any
other
spot
than
at
the
altar
and
in
the
house
of
their
maker
if
there
was
a
single
heart
that
felt
the
least
emotion
of
regret
or
uneasiness
it
was
lady
moseley
who
little
relished
the
retirement
of
the
cottage
on
so
joyful
an
occasion
but
pendennyss
silenced
her
objections
by
replying
the
fates
have
been
so
kind
to
me
in
giving
me
castles
and
seats
you
ought
to
allow
me
my
dear
lady
moseley
the
only
opportunity
i
shall
probably
ever
have
of
enjoying
love
in
a
cottage
a
few
days
however
removed
the
uneasiness
of
the
good
matron
who
had
the
felicity
within
the
week
of
seeing
her
daughter
initiated
mistress
of
annerdale
house
the
morning
of
their
return
to
this
noble
mansion
the
earl
presented
himself
in
james
square
with
the
intelligence
of
their
arrival
and
smiling
as
he
bowed
to
wilson
he
continued
and
to
escort
you
dear
madam
to
your
new
abode
wilson
started
with
surprise
and
with
a
heart
beating
quick
with
emotion
she
required
an
explanation
of
his
words
surely
dearest
wilson
more
than
aunt
my
mother
you
can
not
mean
after
having
trained
my
emily
through
infancy
to
maturity
in
the
paths
of
duty
to
desert
her
in
the
moment
of
her
greatest
trial
i
am
the
pupil
of
your
husband
he
continued
taking
her
hands
in
his
own
with
reverence
and
affection
we
are
the
children
of
your
joint
care
and
one
home
as
there
is
but
one
heart
must
in
future
contain
us
wilson
had
wished
for
but
hardly
dared
to
expect
this
invitation
it
was
now
urged
from
the
right
quarter
and
in
a
manner
that
was
as
sincere
as
it
was
gratifying
unable
to
conceal
her
tears
the
good
widow
pressed
the
hand
of
pendennyss
to
her
lips
as
she
murmured
out
her
thanks
sir
edward
was
prepared
also
to
lose
his
sister
but
unwilling
to
relinquish
the
pleasure
of
her
society
he
urged
her
making
a
common
residence
between
the
two
families
pendennyss
has
spoken
truth
my
dear
brother
cried
she
recovering
her
voice
emily
is
the
child
of
my
care
and
my
love
the
two
beings
i
love
best
in
this
world
are
now
united
but
she
added
pressing
lady
moseley
to
her
bosom
my
heart
is
large
enough
for
you
all
you
are
of
my
blood
and
my
gratitude
for
your
affection
is
boundless
there
shall
be
but
one
large
family
of
us
and
although
our
duties
may
separate
us
for
a
time
we
will
i
trust
ever
meet
in
tenderness
and
love
though
with
george
and
emily
i
will
take
up
my
abode
i
hope
your
house
in
northamptonshire
is
not
to
be
vacant
always
said
lady
moseley
to
the
earl
anxiously
i
have
no
house
there
my
dear
madam
he
replied
when
i
thought
myself
about
to
succeed
in
my
suit
before
i
directed
a
lawyer
at
bath
where
sir
william
harris
resided
most
of
his
time
to
endeavor
to
purchase
the
deanery
whenever
a
good
opportunity
offered
in
my
discomfiture
he
added
smiling
i
forgot
to
countermand
the
order
and
he
purchased
it
immediately
on
its
being
advertised
for
a
short
time
it
was
an
incumbrance
to
me
but
it
is
now
applied
to
its
original
purpose
it
is
the
sole
property
of
the
countess
of
pendennyss
and
i
doubt
not
you
will
see
it
often
and
agreeably
tenanted
this
intelligence
gave
great
satisfaction
to
his
friends
and
the
expected
summer
restored
to
even
jane
a
gleam
of
her
former
pleasure
if
there
be
bliss
in
this
life
approaching
in
any
degree
to
the
happiness
of
the
blessed
it
is
the
fruition
of
long
and
ardent
love
where
youth
innocence
piety
and
family
concord
smile
upon
the
union
and
all
these
were
united
in
the
case
of
the
pair
but
happiness
in
this
world
can
not
or
does
not
in
any
situation
exist
without
alloy
the
peace
of
mind
and
fortitude
of
emily
were
fated
to
receive
a
blow
as
unlooked
for
to
herself
as
it
was
unexpected
to
the
world
bonaparte
appeared
in
france
and
europe
became
in
motion
from
the
moment
the
earl
heard
the
intelligence
his
own
course
was
decided
his
regiment
was
the
pride
of
the
army
and
that
it
would
be
ordered
to
join
the
duke
he
did
not
entertain
a
doubt
emily
was
therefore
in
some
little
measure
prepared
for
the
blow
it
is
at
such
moments
as
our
own
acts
or
events
affecting
us
get
to
be
without
our
control
that
faith
in
the
justice
and
benevolence
of
god
is
the
most
serviceable
to
the
christian
when
others
spend
their
time
in
useless
regrets
he
is
piously
resigned
it
even
so
happens
that
when
others
mourn
he
can
rejoice
the
sound
of
the
bugle
wildly
winding
its
notes
broke
on
the
stillness
of
the
morning
in
the
little
village
in
which
was
situated
the
cottage
tenanted
by
sir
edward
moseley
almost
concealed
by
the
shrubbery
which
surrounded
its
piazza
stood
the
forms
of
the
countess
of
pendennyss
and
her
sister
lady
marian
watching
eagerly
the
appearance
of
those
whose
approach
was
thus
announced
the
carriage
of
the
ladies
with
its
idle
attendants
was
in
waiting
at
a
short
distance
and
the
pale
face
but
composed
resignation
of
its
mistress
indicated
a
struggle
between
conflicting
duties
file
after
file
of
heavy
horse
passed
them
in
military
pomp
and
the
wistful
gaze
of
the
two
females
had
scanned
them
in
vain
for
the
well
known
countenance
of
the
leader
at
length
a
single
horseman
approached
them
riding
deliberately
and
musing
their
forms
met
his
eye
and
in
an
instant
emily
was
pressed
to
the
bosom
of
her
husband
it
is
the
doom
of
a
soldier
said
the
earl
dashing
a
tear
from
his
eye
i
had
hoped
that
the
peace
of
the
world
would
not
again
be
assailed
for
years
and
that
ambition
and
jealousy
would
yield
a
respite
to
our
bloody
profession
but
cheer
up
my
love
hope
for
the
best
your
trust
is
not
in
the
things
of
this
life
and
your
happiness
is
without
the
power
of
man
ah
pendennyss
my
husband
sobbed
emily
sinking
on
his
bosom
take
with
you
my
prayers
my
love
everything
that
can
console
you
everything
that
may
profit
you
i
will
not
tell
you
to
be
careful
of
your
life
your
duty
teaches
you
that
as
a
soldier
expose
it
as
a
husband
guard
it
and
return
to
me
as
you
leave
me
a
lover
the
dearest
of
men
and
a
christian
unwilling
to
prolong
the
pain
of
parting
the
earl
gave
his
wife
a
last
embrace
held
marian
affectionately
to
his
bosom
and
mounting
his
horse
was
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
within
a
few
days
of
the
departure
of
pendennyss
chatterton
was
surprised
with
the
entrance
of
his
mother
and
catharine
his
reception
of
them
was
that
of
a
respectful
child
and
his
wife
exerted
herself
to
be
kind
to
connexions
she
could
not
love
in
order
to
give
pleasure
to
a
husband
she
adored
their
tale
was
soon
told
lord
and
lady
herriefield
were
separated
and
the
dowager
alive
to
the
dangers
of
a
young
woman
in
catharine
situation
and
without
a
single
principle
on
which
to
rest
the
assurance
of
her
blameless
conduct
in
future
had
brought
her
to
england
in
order
to
keep
off
disgrace
by
residing
with
her
child
herself
there
was
nothing
in
his
wife
to
answer
the
expectations
with
which
lord
herriefield
married
she
had
beauty
but
with
that
he
was
already
sated
her
simplicity
which
by
having
her
attention
drawn
elsewhere
had
at
first
charmed
him
was
succeeded
by
the
knowing
conduct
of
a
determined
follower
of
the
fashions
and
a
decided
woman
of
the
world
it
had
never
struck
the
viscount
as
impossible
that
an
artless
and
innocent
girl
would
fall
in
love
with
his
faded
and
bilious
face
but
the
moment
catharine
betrayed
the
arts
of
a
manager
he
saw
at
once
the
artifice
that
had
been
practised
of
course
he
ceased
to
love
her
men
are
flattered
for
a
season
with
notice
that
has
been
unsought
but
it
never
fails
to
injure
the
woman
who
practises
it
in
the
opinion
of
the
other
sex
in
time
without
a
single
feeling
in
common
without
a
regard
to
anything
but
self
in
either
husband
or
wife
it
could
not
but
happen
that
a
separation
must
follow
or
their
days
be
spent
in
wrangling
and
misery
catharine
willingly
left
her
husband
her
husband
more
willingly
got
rid
of
her
during
all
these
movements
the
dowager
had
a
difficult
game
to
play
it
was
unbecoming
her
to
encourage
the
strife
and
it
was
against
her
wishes
to
suppress
it
she
therefore
moralized
with
the
peer
and
frowned
upon
her
daughter
the
viscount
listened
to
her
truisms
with
the
attention
of
a
boy
who
is
told
by
a
drunken
father
how
wicked
it
is
to
love
liquor
and
heeded
them
about
as
much
while
kate
mistress
at
all
events
of
two
thousand
a
year
minded
her
mother
frowns
as
little
as
she
regarded
her
smiles
both
were
indifferent
to
her
a
few
days
after
the
ladies
left
lisbon
the
viscount
proceeded
to
italy
in
company
with
the
repudiated
wife
of
a
british
naval
officer
and
if
kate
was
not
guilty
of
an
offence
of
equal
magnitude
it
was
more
owing
to
her
mother
present
vigilance
than
to
her
previous
care
the
presence
of
wilson
was
a
great
source
of
consolation
to
emily
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
and
as
their
longer
abode
in
town
was
useless
the
countess
declining
to
be
presented
without
the
earl
the
whole
family
decided
upon
a
return
into
northamptonshire
the
deanery
had
been
furnished
by
order
of
pendennyss
immediately
on
his
marriage
and
its
mistress
hastened
to
take
possession
of
her
new
dwelling
the
amusement
and
occupation
of
this
movement
the
planning
of
little
improvements
her
various
duties
under
her
increased
responsibilities
kept
emily
from
dwelling
unduly
upon
the
danger
of
her
husband
she
sought
out
amongst
the
first
objects
of
her
bounty
the
venerable
peasant
whose
loss
had
been
formerly
supplied
by
pendennyss
on
his
first
visit
to
b
after
the
death
of
his
father
there
might
not
have
been
the
usual
discrimination
and
temporal
usefulness
in
this
instance
which
generally
accompanied
her
benevolent
acts
but
it
was
associated
with
the
image
of
her
husband
and
it
could
excite
no
surprise
in
wilson
although
it
did
in
marian
to
see
her
sister
driving
two
or
three
times
a
week
to
relieve
the
necessities
of
a
man
who
appeared
actually
to
be
in
want
of
nothing
sir
edward
was
again
amongst
those
he
loved
and
his
hospitable
board
was
once
more
surrounded
with
the
faces
of
his
friends
and
neighbors
the
haughton
was
always
a
welcome
guest
at
the
hall
and
met
soon
after
their
return
the
collected
family
of
the
baronet
at
a
dinner
given
by
the
latter
to
his
children
and
one
or
two
of
his
most
intimate
neighbors
my
lady
pendennyss
cried
haughton
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
i
have
news
from
the
earl
which
i
know
it
will
do
your
heart
good
to
hear
emily
smiled
at
the
prospect
of
hearing
in
any
manner
of
her
husband
although
she
internally
questioned
the
probability
of
knowing
anything
of
his
movements
of
which
her
daily
letters
did
not
apprise
her
will
you
favor
me
with
the
particulars
of
your
intelligence
sir
said
the
countess
he
has
arrived
safe
with
his
regiment
near
brussels
heard
it
from
a
neighbor
son
who
saw
him
enter
the
house
occupied
by
wellington
while
he
was
standing
in
the
crowd
without
waiting
to
get
a
peep
at
the
duke
oh
said
wilson
with
a
laugh
emily
knew
that
ten
days
ago
could
your
friend
tell
us
anything
of
bonaparte
we
are
much
interested
in
his
movements
just
now
haughton
a
good
deal
mortified
to
find
his
news
stale
mused
a
moment
as
if
in
doubt
to
proceed
or
not
but
liking
of
all
things
to
act
the
part
of
a
newspaper
he
continued
nothing
more
than
you
see
in
the
prints
but
i
suppose
your
ladyship
has
heard
about
captain
jarvis
too
why
no
said
emily
laughing
the
movements
of
captain
jarvis
are
not
quite
as
interesting
to
me
as
those
of
lord
pendennyss
has
the
duke
made
him
an
oh
no
cried
the
other
exulting
at
his
having
something
new
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
the
return
of
boney
he
threw
up
his
commission
and
got
married
married
cried
john
not
to
miss
harris
surely
no
to
a
silly
girl
he
met
in
cornwall
who
was
fool
enough
to
be
caught
with
his
gold
lace
he
married
one
day
and
the
next
told
his
disconsolate
wife
and
mother
that
the
honor
of
the
jarvises
must
sleep
until
the
supporters
of
the
name
became
sufficiently
numerous
to
risk
them
in
the
field
of
battle
and
how
did
jarvis
and
sir
timo
lady
relish
the
news
inquired
john
expecting
something
ridiculous
not
at
all
rejoined
haughton
the
former
sobbed
and
said
she
had
only
married
him
for
his
bravery
and
red
coat
and
the
lady
exclaimed
against
the
destruction
of
his
budding
honors
how
did
it
terminate
asked
wilson
why
it
seems
while
they
were
quarrelling
about
it
the
cut
the
matter
short
by
accepting
his
resignation
i
suppose
the
had
learned
his
character
but
the
matter
was
warmly
contested
they
even
drove
the
captain
to
a
declaration
of
his
principles
and
what
kind
of
ones
might
they
have
been
haughton
said
sir
edward
drily
republican
republican
exclaimed
two
or
three
in
surprise
yes
liberty
and
equality
he
contended
were
his
idols
and
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
fight
against
bonaparte
a
somewhat
singular
conclusion
said
benfield
musing
i
remember
when
i
sat
in
the
house
there
was
a
party
who
were
fond
of
the
cry
of
this
said
liberty
but
when
they
got
the
power
they
did
not
seem
to
me
to
suffer
people
to
go
more
at
large
than
they
went
before
but
i
suppose
they
were
diffident
of
telling
the
world
their
minds
after
they
were
put
in
such
responsible
stations
for
fear
of
the
effect
of
example
most
people
like
liberty
as
servants
but
not
as
masters
uncle
cried
john
with
a
sneer
captain
jarvis
it
seems
liked
it
as
a
preservative
against
danger
continued
haughton
to
avoid
ridicule
in
his
new
neighborhood
he
has
consented
to
his
father
wishes
and
turned
merchant
in
the
city
again
where
i
sincerely
hope
he
will
remain
cried
john
who
since
the
accident
of
the
arbor
could
not
tolerate
the
unfortunate
youth
amen
said
emily
in
an
under
tone
heard
only
by
her
brother
but
sir
timo
what
has
become
of
sir
timo
the
good
honest
merchant
asked
john
he
has
dropt
the
title
insists
on
being
called
plain
jarvis
and
lives
entirely
in
cornwall
his
hopeful
has
gone
with
his
regiment
to
flanders
and
lady
egerton
being
unable
to
live
without
her
father
assistance
is
obliged
to
hide
her
consequence
in
the
west
also
the
subject
became
now
disagreeable
to
lady
moseley
and
it
was
changed
such
conversations
made
jane
more
reserved
and
dissatisfied
than
ever
she
had
no
one
respectable
excuse
to
offer
for
her
partiality
to
her
former
lover
and
when
her
conscience
told
her
the
mortifying
fact
was
apt
to
think
that
others
remembered
it
too
the
letters
from
the
continent
now
teemed
with
preparations
for
the
approaching
contest
and
the
apprehensions
of
our
heroine
and
her
friends
increased
in
proportion
to
the
nearness
of
the
struggle
on
which
hung
not
only
the
fates
of
thousands
of
individuals
but
of
adverse
princes
and
mighty
empires
in
this
confusion
of
interests
and
of
jarring
of
passions
there
were
offered
prayers
almost
hourly
for
the
safety
of
pendennyss
which
were
as
pure
and
ardent
as
the
love
which
prompted
them
chapter
xlviii
napoleon
had
commenced
those
daring
and
rapid
movements
which
for
a
time
threw
the
peace
of
the
world
into
the
scale
of
fortune
and
which
nothing
but
the
interposition
of
a
ruling
providence
could
avert
from
their
threatened
success
as
the
the
th
dragoons
wheeled
into
a
field
already
deluged
with
english
blood
on
the
heights
of
quatre
bras
the
eye
of
its
gallant
colonel
saw
a
friendly
battalion
falling
beneath
the
sabres
of
the
enemy
cuirassiers
the
word
was
passed
the
column
opens
the
sounds
of
the
quivering
bugle
were
heard
for
a
moment
above
the
roar
of
the
cannon
and
the
shouts
of
the
combatants
the
charge
sweeping
like
a
whirlwind
fell
heavily
on
those
treacherous
frenchmen
who
had
sworn
fidelity
to
louis
and
intended
lifting
their
hands
in
allegiance
to
his
rival
spare
my
life
in
mercy
cried
an
officer
already
dreadfully
wounded
who
stood
shrinking
from
the
impending
blow
of
an
enraged
frenchman
an
english
dragoon
dashed
at
the
cuirassier
and
with
one
blow
severed
his
arm
from
his
body
thank
god
sighed
the
wounded
officer
sinking
beneath
the
feet
his
rescuer
threw
himself
from
the
saddle
and
raising
the
fallen
man
inquired
into
his
wounds
it
was
pendennyss
and
it
was
egerton
the
wounded
man
groaned
aloud
as
he
saw
the
face
of
him
who
had
averted
the
fatal
blow
but
it
was
not
the
hour
for
explanations
or
confessions
other
than
those
with
which
the
dying
soldiers
endeavored
to
make
their
tardy
peace
with
their
god
sir
henry
was
given
in
charge
to
two
slightly
wounded
british
soldiers
and
the
earl
remounted
the
scattered
troops
were
rallied
at
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
and
again
and
again
led
by
their
dauntless
colonel
were
seen
in
the
thickest
of
the
fray
with
sabres
drenched
in
blood
and
voices
hoarse
with
the
shouts
of
victory
the
period
between
the
battles
of
quatre
bras
and
waterloo
was
a
trying
one
to
the
discipline
and
courage
of
the
british
army
the
discomfited
prussians
on
their
flank
had
been
routed
and
compelled
to
retire
and
in
their
front
was
an
enemy
brave
skilful
and
victorious
led
by
the
greatest
captain
of
the
age
the
prudent
commander
of
the
english
forces
fell
back
with
dignity
and
reluctance
to
the
field
of
waterloo
here
the
mighty
struggle
was
to
terminate
and
the
eye
of
every
experienced
soldier
looked
on
those
eminences
as
on
the
future
graves
for
thousands
during
this
solemn
interval
of
comparative
inactivity
the
mind
of
pendennyss
dwelt
on
the
affection
the
innocence
the
beauty
and
worth
of
his
emily
until
the
curdling
blood
as
he
thought
on
her
lot
should
his
life
be
the
purchase
of
the
coming
victory
warned
him
to
quit
the
gloomy
subject
for
the
consolations
of
that
religion
which
only
could
yield
him
the
solace
his
wounded
feelings
required
in
his
former
campaigns
the
earl
had
been
sensible
of
the
mighty
changes
of
death
and
had
ever
kept
in
view
the
preparations
necessary
to
meet
it
with
hope
and
joy
but
the
world
clung
around
him
now
in
the
best
affections
of
his
nature
and
it
was
only
as
he
could
picture
the
happy
reunion
with
his
emily
in
a
future
life
that
he
could
look
on
a
separation
in
this
without
despair
the
vicinity
of
the
enemy
admitted
of
no
relaxation
in
the
strictest
watchfulness
in
the
british
lines
and
the
comfortless
night
of
the
seventeenth
was
passed
by
the
earl
and
his
lieutenant
colonel
george
denbigh
on
the
same
cloak
and
under
the
open
canopy
of
heaven
as
the
opening
cannon
of
the
enemy
gave
the
signal
for
the
commencing
conflict
pendennyss
mounted
his
charger
with
a
last
thought
on
his
distant
wife
with
a
mighty
struggle
he
tore
her
as
it
were
from
his
bosom
and
gave
the
remainder
of
the
day
to
duty
who
has
not
heard
of
the
events
of
that
fearful
hour
on
which
the
fate
of
europe
hung
as
it
were
suspended
in
the
scale
on
one
side
supported
by
the
efforts
of
desperate
resolution
guided
by
the
most
consummate
art
and
on
the
other
defended
by
a
discipline
and
enduring
courage
almost
without
a
parallel
the
indefatigable
blucher
arrived
and
the
star
of
napoleon
sank
pendennyss
threw
himself
from
his
horse
on
the
night
of
the
eighteenth
of
june
as
he
gave
way
by
orders
in
the
pursuit
to
the
fresher
battalions
of
the
prussians
with
the
languor
that
follows
unusual
excitement
and
mental
thanksgivings
that
this
bloody
work
was
at
length
ended
the
image
of
his
emily
again
broke
over
the
sterner
feelings
of
the
battle
like
the
first
glimmerings
of
light
which
succeed
the
awful
darkness
of
the
eclipse
of
the
sun
and
he
again
breathed
freely
in
the
consciousness
of
the
happiness
which
would
await
his
speedy
return
i
am
sent
for
the
colonel
of
the
th
dragoons
said
a
courier
in
broken
english
to
a
soldier
near
where
the
earl
lay
on
the
ground
waiting
the
preparations
of
his
attendants
have
i
found
the
right
regiment
my
friend
to
be
sure
you
have
answered
the
man
without
looking
up
from
his
toil
on
his
favorite
animal
you
might
have
tracked
us
by
the
dead
frenchmen
i
should
think
so
you
want
my
lord
my
lad
do
you
do
we
move
again
suspending
his
labor
for
a
moment
in
expectation
of
a
reply
not
to
my
knowledge
rejoined
the
courier
my
message
is
to
your
colonel
from
a
dying
man
will
you
point
out
his
station
the
soldier
complied
the
message
was
soon
delivered
and
pendennyss
prepared
to
obey
its
summons
immediately
preceded
by
the
messenger
as
a
guide
and
followed
by
harmer
the
earl
retraced
his
steps
over
that
ground
on
which
he
had
but
a
few
hours
before
been
engaged
in
the
deadly
strife
of
man
to
man
hand
to
hand
how
different
is
the
contemplation
of
a
field
of
battle
during
and
after
the
conflict
the
excitement
suspended
success
shouts
uproar
and
confusion
of
the
former
prevent
any
contemplation
of
the
nicer
parts
of
this
confused
mass
of
movements
charges
and
retreats
or
if
a
brilliant
advance
is
made
a
masterly
retreat
effected
the
imagination
is
chained
by
the
splendor
and
glory
of
the
act
without
resting
for
a
moment
on
the
sacrifice
of
individual
happiness
with
which
it
is
purchased
a
from
which
the
whirlwind
of
the
combat
has
passed
presents
a
different
sight
it
offers
the
very
consummation
of
human
misery
there
may
occasionally
be
an
individual
who
from
station
distempered
mind
or
the
encouragement
of
chimerical
ideas
of
glory
quits
the
theatre
of
life
with
at
least
the
appearance
of
pleasure
in
his
triumphs
if
such
there
be
in
reality
if
this
rapture
of
departing
glory
be
anything
more
than
the
deception
of
a
distempered
excitement
the
subject
of
its
exhibition
is
to
be
greatly
pitied
to
the
christian
dying
in
peace
with
both
god
and
man
can
it
alone
be
ceded
in
the
eye
of
reason
to
pour
out
his
existence
with
a
smile
on
his
quivering
lip
and
the
warrior
who
falls
in
the
very
arms
of
victory
after
passing
a
life
devoted
to
the
world
even
if
he
sees
kingdoms
hang
suspended
on
his
success
may
smile
indeed
may
utter
sentiments
full
of
loyalty
and
zeal
may
be
the
admiration
of
the
world
and
what
is
his
reward
a
deathless
name
and
an
existence
of
misery
which
knows
no
termination
christianity
alone
can
make
us
good
soldiers
in
any
cause
for
he
who
knows
how
to
live
is
always
the
least
afraid
to
die
pendennyss
and
his
companions
pushed
their
way
over
the
ground
occupied
before
the
battle
by
the
enemy
descended
into
and
through
that
little
valley
in
which
yet
lay
in
undistinguished
confusion
masses
of
the
dead
and
dying
of
either
side
and
again
over
the
ridge
on
which
could
be
marked
the
situation
of
those
gallant
squares
which
had
so
long
resisted
the
efforts
of
the
horse
and
artillery
by
the
groups
of
bodies
fallen
where
they
had
bravely
stood
until
even
the
callous
harmer
sickened
with
the
sight
of
a
waste
of
life
that
he
had
but
a
few
hours
before
exultingly
contributed
to
increase
appeals
to
their
feelings
as
they
rode
through
the
field
had
been
frequent
and
their
progress
was
much
retarded
by
attempts
to
contribute
to
the
ease
of
a
wounded
or
a
dying
man
but
as
the
courier
constantly
urged
speed
as
the
only
means
of
securing
the
object
of
their
ride
these
halts
were
reluctantly
abandoned
it
was
ten
before
they
reached
the
where
in
the
midst
of
hundreds
of
his
countrymen
lay
the
former
lover
of
jane
as
the
subject
of
his
confession
must
be
anticipated
by
the
reader
we
will
give
a
short
relation
of
his
life
and
of
those
acts
which
more
materially
affect
our
history
henry
egerton
had
been
turned
early
on
the
world
hundreds
of
his
countrymen
without
any
principle
to
counteract
the
arts
of
infidelity
or
resist
the
temptations
of
life
his
father
held
a
situation
under
government
and
was
devoted
to
his
rise
in
the
diplomatic
line
his
mother
was
a
woman
of
fashion
who
lived
for
effect
and
idle
competition
with
her
sisters
in
weakness
and
folly
all
he
learnt
in
his
house
was
selfishness
from
the
example
of
one
and
a
love
of
high
life
and
its
extravagance
from
the
other
he
entered
the
army
young
and
from
choice
the
splendor
and
reputation
of
the
service
caught
his
fancy
and
by
pride
and
constitution
he
was
indifferent
to
personal
danger
yet
he
loved
london
and
its
amusements
better
than
glory
and
the
money
of
his
uncle
sir
edgar
whose
heir
he
was
reputed
to
be
raised
him
to
the
rank
of
lieutenant
colonel
without
his
spending
an
hour
in
the
field
egerton
had
some
abilities
and
a
good
deal
of
ardor
of
temperament
by
nature
the
former
from
indulgence
and
example
degenerated
into
acquiring
the
art
to
please
in
mixed
society
and
the
latter
from
want
of
employment
expended
itself
at
the
card
table
the
association
between
the
vices
is
intimate
there
really
appears
to
be
a
kind
of
modesty
in
sin
that
makes
it
ashamed
of
good
company
if
we
are
unable
to
reconcile
a
favorite
propensity
to
our
principles
we
are
apt
to
abandon
the
unpleasant
restraint
on
our
actions
rather
than
admit
the
incongruous
mixture
freed
entirely
from
the
fetters
of
our
morals
what
is
there
that
our
vices
will
not
prompt
us
to
commit
egerton
like
thousands
of
others
went
on
from
step
to
step
until
he
found
himself
in
the
world
free
to
follow
all
his
inclinations
so
he
violated
none
of
the
decencies
of
life
when
in
spain
in
his
only
campaign
he
was
accidentally
as
has
been
mentioned
thrown
in
the
way
of
the
donna
julia
and
brought
her
off
the
ground
under
the
influence
of
natural
sympathy
and
national
feeling
a
kind
of
merit
that
makes
vice
only
more
dangerous
by
making
it
sometimes
amiable
he
had
not
seen
his
dependant
long
before
her
beauty
situation
and
his
passions
decided
him
to
effect
her
ruin
this
was
an
occupation
that
his
figure
manners
and
propensities
had
made
him
an
adept
in
and
nothing
was
further
from
his
thoughts
than
the
commission
of
any
other
than
the
crime
that
according
to
his
code
a
gentleman
might
be
guilty
of
with
impunity
it
is
however
the
misfortune
of
sin
that
from
being
our
slave
it
becomes
a
tyrant
and
egerton
attempted
what
in
other
countries
and
where
the
laws
ruled
might
have
cost
him
his
life
the
conjecture
of
pendennyss
was
true
he
saw
the
face
of
the
officer
who
interposed
between
him
and
his
villanous
attempt
but
was
hid
himself
from
view
he
aimed
not
at
his
life
but
at
his
own
escape
happily
his
first
shot
succeeded
for
the
earl
would
have
been
sacrificed
to
preserve
the
character
of
a
man
of
honor
though
no
one
was
more
regardless
of
the
estimation
he
was
held
in
by
the
virtuous
than
colonel
egerton
in
pursuance
of
his
plans
on
fitzgerald
the
colonel
had
sedulously
avoided
admitting
any
of
his
companions
into
the
secret
of
his
having
a
female
in
his
care
when
he
left
the
army
to
return
home
he
remained
until
a
movement
of
the
troops
to
a
distant
part
of
the
country
enabled
him
to
effect
his
own
purposes
without
incurring
their
ridicule
and
when
he
found
himself
obliged
to
abandon
his
vehicle
for
a
refuge
in
the
woods
the
fear
of
detection
made
him
alter
his
course
and
under
the
pretence
of
wishing
to
be
in
a
battle
about
to
be
fought
he
secretly
rejoined
the
army
and
the
gallantry
of
colonel
egerton
was
mentioned
in
the
next
despatches
sir
herbert
nicholson
commanded
the
advanced
guard
at
which
the
earl
arrived
with
the
donna
julia
and
like
every
other
brave
man
unless
guilty
himself
was
indignant
at
the
villany
of
the
fugitive
the
confusion
and
enormities
daily
practised
in
the
theatre
of
the
war
prevented
any
close
inquiries
into
the
subject
and
circumstances
had
so
enveloped
egerton
in
mystery
that
nothing
but
an
interview
with
the
lady
herself
was
likely
to
expose
him
with
sir
herbert
nicholson
he
had
been
in
habits
of
intimacy
and
on
that
gentleman
alluding
in
a
conversation
in
the
barracks
at
f
to
the
lady
brought
into
his
quarters
before
lisbon
he
accidentally
omitted
mentioning
the
name
of
her
rescuer
egerton
had
never
before
heard
the
transaction
spoken
of
and
as
he
had
of
course
never
mentioned
the
subject
himself
was
ignorant
who
had
interfered
between
him
and
his
views
also
of
the
fate
of
donna
julia
indeed
he
thought
it
probable
that
it
had
not
much
improved
by
a
change
of
guardians
in
coming
into
northamptonshire
he
had
several
views
he
wanted
a
temporary
retreat
from
his
creditors
jarvis
had
an
infant
fondness
for
play
without
an
adequate
skill
and
the
money
of
the
young
ladies
in
his
necessities
was
becoming
of
importance
but
the
daughters
of
sir
edward
moseley
were
of
a
description
more
suited
to
his
taste
and
their
portions
were
as
ample
as
the
others
he
had
become
in
some
degree
attached
to
jane
and
as
her
imprudent
parents
satisfied
with
his
possessing
the
exterior
and
requisite
recommendations
of
a
gentleman
admitted
his
visits
freely
he
determined
to
make
her
his
wife
when
he
met
denbigh
the
first
time
he
saw
that
chance
had
thrown
him
in
the
way
of
a
man
who
might
hold
his
character
in
his
power
he
had
never
seen
him
as
pendennyss
and
it
will
be
remembered
was
ignorant
of
the
name
of
julia
friend
he
now
learnt
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
denbigh
uneasy
at
he
knew
not
what
fearful
of
some
exposure
he
knew
not
how
when
sir
herbert
alluded
to
the
occurrence
with
a
view
to
rebut
the
charge
if
denbigh
should
choose
to
make
one
and
with
the
of
guilt
he
pretended
to
know
the
occurrence
and
under
the
promise
of
secresy
mentioned
that
the
name
of
the
officer
was
denbigh
he
had
noticed
denbigh
avoiding
sir
herbert
at
the
ball
and
judging
others
from
himself
thought
it
was
a
wish
to
avoid
any
allusions
to
the
lady
he
had
brought
into
the
other
quarters
that
induced
the
measure
for
he
was
in
hopes
that
if
denbigh
was
not
as
guilty
as
himself
he
was
sufficiently
so
to
wish
to
keep
the
transaction
from
the
eyes
of
emily
he
was
however
prepared
for
an
explosion
or
an
alliance
with
him
when
the
sudden
departure
of
sir
herbert
removed
the
danger
of
a
collision
believing
at
last
that
they
were
to
be
and
mistaking
the
earl
for
his
cousin
whose
name
he
bore
egerton
became
reconciled
to
the
association
while
pendennyss
having
in
his
absence
heard
on
inquiring
some
of
the
vices
of
the
colonel
was
debating
with
himself
whether
he
should
expose
them
to
sir
edward
or
not
it
was
in
their
occasional
interchange
of
civilities
that
pendennyss
placed
his
upon
a
table
while
he
exhibited
the
plants
to
the
colonel
the
figure
of
emily
passing
the
window
drew
him
from
the
room
and
egerton
having
ended
his
examination
observing
the
book
put
it
in
his
own
pocket
to
return
it
to
its
owner
when
they
next
met
the
situation
name
and
history
of
fitzgerald
were
never
mentioned
by
the
moseleys
in
public
but
jane
in
the
confidence
of
her
affections
had
told
her
lover
who
the
inmate
of
the
cottage
was
the
idea
of
her
being
kept
there
by
denbigh
immediately
occurred
to
him
and
although
he
was
surprised
at
the
audacity
of
the
thing
he
was
determined
to
profit
by
the
occasion
to
pay
this
visit
he
stayed
away
from
the
excursion
on
the
water
as
pendennyss
had
done
to
avoid
his
friend
lord
henry
stapleton
an
excuse
of
business
which
served
for
his
apology
kept
the
colonel
from
seeing
denbigh
to
return
the
book
until
after
his
visit
to
the
cottage
his
rhapsody
of
love
and
offers
to
desert
his
intended
wife
were
nothing
but
the
talk
of
his
purposes
and
his
presumption
in
alluding
to
his
situation
with
miss
moseley
proceeded
from
his
impressions
as
to
julia
real
character
in
the
struggle
for
the
bell
the
of
denbigh
accidentally
fell
from
his
coat
and
the
retreat
of
the
colonel
was
too
precipitate
to
enable
him
to
recover
it
fitzgerald
was
too
much
alarmed
to
distinguish
nicely
and
egerton
proceeded
to
the
with
the
indifference
of
a
hardened
offender
when
the
arrival
of
miss
jarvis
to
whom
he
had
committed
himself
prompted
him
to
a
speedy
declaration
and
the
unlucky
conversation
of
holt
brought
about
a
probable
detection
of
his
gaming
propensities
the
colonel
determined
to
get
rid
of
his
awkward
situation
and
his
debts
by
a
he
accordingly
eloped
with
miss
jarvis
what
portion
of
the
foregoing
narrative
made
the
dying
confession
of
egerton
to
the
man
he
had
so
lately
discovered
to
be
the
earl
of
pendennyss
the
reader
can
easily
imagine
chapter
xlix
the
harvest
had
been
gathered
and
the
beautiful
vales
of
pendennyss
were
shooting
forth
a
second
crop
of
verdure
the
husbandman
was
turning
his
prudent
forethought
to
the
promises
of
the
coming
year
while
the
castle
itself
exhibited
to
the
gaze
of
the
wondering
peasant
a
sight
of
cheerfulness
and
animation
which
had
not
been
seen
in
it
since
the
days
of
the
good
duke
its
numerous
windows
were
opened
to
the
light
of
the
sun
its
halls
teemed
with
the
faces
of
its
happy
inmates
servants
in
various
liveries
were
seen
gliding
through
its
magnificent
apartments
and
multiplied
passages
horses
grooms
and
carriages
with
varied
costumes
and
different
armorial
bearings
crowded
its
spacious
stables
and
offices
everything
spoke
society
splendor
and
activity
without
everything
denoted
order
propriety
and
happiness
within
in
a
long
range
of
spacious
apartments
were
grouped
in
the
pursuit
of
their
morning
employments
or
in
arranging
their
duties
and
pleasures
of
the
day
the
guests
and
owners
of
the
princely
abode
in
one
room
was
john
moseley
carefully
examining
the
properties
of
some
flints
which
were
submitted
to
his
examination
by
his
attending
servant
while
grace
sitting
at
his
side
playfully
snatches
the
stones
from
his
hand
as
she
cries
half
reproachfully
half
tenderly
you
must
not
devote
yourself
to
your
gun
so
incessantly
moseley
it
is
cruel
to
kill
inoffensive
birds
for
your
amusement
only
ask
emily
cook
and
haughton
appetite
said
john
coolly
extending
his
hand
towards
her
for
the
flint
whether
no
one
is
gratified
but
myself
i
tell
you
grace
i
seldom
fire
in
vain
that
only
makes
the
matter
worse
the
slaughter
you
commit
is
dreadful
oh
cried
john
with
a
laugh
the
captain
jarvis
is
a
sportsman
to
your
mind
he
would
shoot
a
month
without
moving
a
feather
he
was
a
great
friend
to
throwing
an
arch
look
to
his
solitary
sister
who
sat
on
a
sofa
at
a
distance
perusing
a
book
jane
feathered
songsters
but
now
mosely
said
grace
yielding
the
flints
but
gently
retaining
the
hand
that
took
them
pendenyss
and
chatterton
intend
driving
their
wives
like
good
husbands
to
see
the
beautiful
waterfall
in
the
mountains
and
what
am
i
to
do
this
long
tedious
morning
john
stole
an
enquiring
glance
to
see
if
his
wife
was
very
anxious
to
join
the
party
cast
one
look
of
regret
on
a
beautiful
agate
that
he
had
selected
and
inquired
do
you
wish
to
go
very
much
mrs
mosely
indeed
indeed
i
do
said
the
other
eagerly
if
if
what
you
will
drive
me
continued
she
with
a
cheek
slightly
tinged
with
color
well
then
answered
john
with
deliberation
and
regarding
his
wife
with
affection
i
will
go
on
one
condition
name
it
cried
grace
with
still
increasing
color
that
you
will
not
expose
your
health
again
in
going
to
the
church
on
a
sunday
if
it
rains
the
carriage
is
so
close
mosely
answered
grace
with
a
paler
cheek
than
beforehand
eyes
fixed
on
the
carpet
it
is
impossible
i
can
take
cold
you
see
the
earl
and
countess
and
aunt
wilson
never
miss
public
worship
when
possibly
within
their
power
the
earl
goes
with
his
wife
but
what
becomes
of
poor
me
at
such
times
said
john
taking
her
hand
and
pressing
it
kindly
i
like
to
hear
a
good
sermon
but
not
in
bad
weather
you
must
consent
to
oblige
me
who
only
live
in
your
presence
grace
smiled
faintly
as
john
pursuing
the
point
said
what
do
you
say
to
my
condition
well
then
if
you
wish
replied
graces
without
the
look
of
gaiety
her
hopes
had
first
inspired
i
will
not
go
if
it
rain
john
ordered
his
phaeton
and
his
wife
went
to
her
room
to
prepare
for
the
trip
and
to
regret
her
own
resolution
in
the
recess
of
a
window
in
which
bloomed
a
profusion
of
exotics
stood
the
figure
of
lady
marian
denbigh
playing
with
a
rose
of
the
richest
colors
and
before
her
leaning
against
the
angle
of
the
wall
stood
her
kinsman
the
duke
of
derwent
you
heard
the
plan
at
the
breakfast
table
said
his
grace
to
visit
the
little
falls
in
the
hills
but
i
suppose
you
have
seen
them
too
often
to
undergo
the
fatigue
oh
no
i
love
that
ride
dearly
and
should
wish
to
accompany
the
countess
in
her
first
visit
to
it
i
had
half
a
mind
to
ask
george
to
take
me
in
his
phaeton
my
curricle
would
be
honored
with
the
presence
of
lady
marian
denbigh
cried
the
duke
with
animation
if
she
would
accept
me
for
her
knight
on
the
occasion
marian
bowed
an
assent
in
evident
satisfaction
as
the
duke
proceeded
but
if
you
take
me
as
your
knight
i
should
wear
your
colors
and
he
held
out
his
hand
towards
the
budding
rose
lady
marian
hesitated
a
moment
looked
out
at
the
prospect
up
at
the
wall
turned
and
wondered
where
her
brother
was
and
still
finding
the
hand
of
the
duke
extended
while
his
eye
rested
on
her
in
admiration
she
gave
him
the
boon
with
a
cheek
that
vied
with
the
richest
tints
of
the
flower
they
separated
to
prepare
and
it
was
on
their
return
from
the
falls
that
the
duke
seemed
uncommonly
gay
and
amusing
and
the
lady
silent
with
her
tongue
though
her
eyes
danced
in
every
direction
but
towards
her
cousin
really
my
dear
lady
mosely
said
the
dowager
as
seated
by
the
side
of
her
companion
her
eyes
roved
over
the
magnificence
within
and
widely
extended
domains
without
emily
is
well
established
indeed
better
even
than
my
grace
grace
has
an
affectionate
husband
replied
the
other
gravely
and
one
that
i
hope
will
make
her
happy
oh
no
doubt
happy
said
lady
chatterton
hastily
but
they
say
emily
has
a
jointure
of
twelve
thousand
a
year
she
added
in
a
low
tone
though
no
one
was
near
enough
to
hear
what
she
said
could
not
the
earl
have
settled
lumley
castle
on
her
instead
of
the
deanery
upon
my
word
i
never
think
of
such
gloomy
subjects
as
provisions
for
widowhood
cried
lady
mosely
you
have
been
in
annerdale
house
is
it
not
a
princely
mansion
princely
indeed
rejoined
the
dowager
sighing
do
the
earl
intend
increasing
the
rents
of
this
estate
as
the
leases
fall
in
i
am
told
they
are
very
low
now
i
believe
not
said
the
other
he
has
enough
and
is
willing
others
should
prosper
but
there
is
clara
with
her
little
boy
is
he
not
a
lovely
child
cried
the
grandmother
rising
to
take
the
infant
in
her
arms
oh
excessively
beautiful
said
the
dowager
looking
the
other
way
and
observing
catharine
making
a
movement
towards
lord
henry
stapleton
she
called
to
her
lady
herriefield
come
this
way
my
dear
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
kate
obeyed
with
a
sullen
pout
of
her
pretty
lip
and
entered
into
some
idle
discussion
about
a
cap
though
her
eyes
wandered
round
the
rooms
in
listless
vacancy
the
dowager
had
the
curse
of
bad
impressions
in
youth
to
contend
with
and
labored
infinitely
harder
now
to
make
her
daughter
act
right
than
formerly
she
had
ever
done
to
make
her
act
wrong
here
uncle
benfield
cried
emily
with
a
face
glowing
with
health
and
animation
as
she
approached
his
seat
with
a
glass
in
her
hands
here
is
the
negus
you
wished
i
have
made
it
myself
and
you
will
praise
it
of
course
oh
my
dear
lady
pendennyss
said
the
old
gentleman
rising
politely
from
his
seat
to
receive
the
beverage
you
are
putting
yourself
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
for
an
old
bachelor
like
me
too
much
indeed
too
much
old
bachelors
are
sometimes
more
esteemed
than
young
one
cried
the
earl
gaily
joining
them
in
time
to
hear
this
speech
here
is
my
friend
peter
johnson
who
knows
when
we
may
dance
at
his
wedding
my
lord
and
my
lady
and
my
honored
master
said
peter
gravely
in
reply
bowing
respectfully
where
he
stood
waiting
to
take
his
glass
i
am
past
the
age
to
think
of
a
wife
i
am
coming
next
counting
by
the
old
style
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
your
three
hundred
a
year
said
emily
with
a
smile
unless
you
bestow
it
on
some
good
woman
for
making
the
evening
of
your
life
comfortable
my
lady
hem
my
lady
said
the
steward
blushing
i
had
a
little
thought
with
your
kind
ladyship
consent
as
i
have
no
relations
chick
or
child
in
the
world
what
to
do
with
it
i
should
be
happy
to
hear
your
plan
said
the
countess
observing
that
the
steward
was
anxious
to
communicate
something
why
my
lady
if
my
lord
and
my
honored
master
agreeable
i
did
think
of
making
another
codicil
to
master
will
in
order
to
dispose
of
it
your
master
will
said
the
earl
laughing
why
not
to
your
own
good
peter
my
honored
lord
said
the
steward
with
great
humility
it
become
a
poor
like
me
to
make
a
will
but
how
will
you
prove
it
said
the
earl
kindly
willing
to
convince
him
of
his
error
you
must
be
both
dead
to
prove
it
our
wills
said
peter
gulping
his
words
will
be
proved
on
the
same
day
his
master
looked
round
at
him
with
great
affection
and
both
the
earl
and
emily
were
too
much
struck
to
say
anything
peter
had
however
the
subject
too
much
at
heart
to
abandon
it
just
as
he
had
broken
the
ice
he
anxiously
wished
for
the
countess
consent
to
the
scheme
for
he
would
not
affront
her
even
after
he
was
dead
my
lady
miss
emmy
said
johnson
eagerly
my
plan
is
if
my
honored
master
agreeable
to
make
a
codicil
and
give
my
mite
to
a
little
lady
emily
denbigh
oh
peter
you
and
uncle
benfield
are
both
too
good
cried
emily
laughing
and
blushing
as
she
hastened
to
clara
and
her
mother
thank
you
thank
you
cried
the
delighted
earl
following
his
wife
with
his
eyes
and
shaking
the
steward
cordially
by
the
hand
and
if
no
better
expedient
be
adopted
by
us
you
have
full
permission
to
do
as
you
please
with
your
money
peter
said
his
master
to
him
in
a
low
tone
you
should
never
speak
of
such
things
prematurely
now
i
remember
when
the
earl
of
pendennyss
my
nephew
was
first
presented
to
me
i
was
struck
with
the
delicacy
and
propriety
of
his
demeanor
and
the
lady
pendennyss
my
niece
too
you
never
see
any
thing
forward
or
ah
emmy
dear
said
the
old
man
tenderly
interrupting
himself
you
are
too
good
to
remember
your
old
uncle
taking
one
of
the
fine
peaches
she
handed
him
from
a
plate
my
lord
said
haughton
to
the
earl
ives
and
myself
have
had
a
contest
about
the
comforts
of
matrimony
she
insists
she
may
be
quite
as
happy
at
bolton
parsonage
as
in
this
noble
castle
and
with
this
rich
prospect
in
view
i
hope
said
francis
you
are
not
teaching
my
wife
to
be
discontented
with
her
humble
lot
if
so
both
hers
and
your
visit
will
be
an
unhappy
one
it
would
be
no
easy
task
if
our
good
friend
intended
any
such
thing
by
his
jests
said
clara
smiling
i
know
my
true
interests
i
trust
too
well
to
wish
to
change
my
fortune
you
are
right
said
pendennyss
it
is
wonderful
how
little
our
happiness
depends
on
a
temporal
condition
when
here
or
at
lumley
castle
surrounded
by
my
tenantry
there
are
i
confess
moments
of
weakness
in
which
the
loss
of
my
wealth
or
rank
would
be
missed
greatly
but
when
on
service
subjected
to
great
privations
and
surrounded
by
men
superior
to
me
in
military
rank
who
say
unto
me
go
and
i
go
come
and
i
come
i
find
my
enjoyments
intrinsically
the
same
that
said
francis
may
be
owing
to
your
lordship
tempered
feelings
which
have
taught
you
to
look
beyond
this
world
for
pleasures
and
consolation
it
has
doubtless
an
effect
said
the
earl
but
there
is
no
truth
of
which
i
am
more
fully
persuaded
than
that
our
happiness
here
does
not
depend
upon
our
lot
in
life
so
we
are
not
suffering
for
necessaries
even
changes
bring
less
real
misery
than
they
are
supposed
to
do
doubtless
cried
haughton
under
the
circumstances
i
would
not
wish
to
change
even
with
your
lordship
unless
indeed
he
continued
with
a
smile
and
bow
to
the
countess
it
were
the
temptation
of
your
lovely
wife
you
are
quite
polite
said
emily
laughing
but
i
have
no
desire
to
deprive
haughton
of
a
companion
she
has
made
out
so
well
with
these
twenty
years
past
thirty
my
lady
if
you
please
and
thirty
more
i
hope
continued
emily
as
a
servant
announced
the
several
carriages
at
the
door
the
younger
part
of
the
company
now
hastened
to
their
different
engagements
and
chatterton
handed
harriet
john
grace
and
pendennyss
emily
into
their
respective
carriages
the
duke
and
lady
marian
following
but
at
some
little
distance
from
the
rest
of
the
party
as
the
earl
drove
from
the
door
the
countess
looked
up
to
a
window
at
which
were
standing
her
aunt
and
doctor
ives
she
kissed
her
hand
to
them
with
a
face
in
which
glowed
the
mingled
expression
of
innocence
love
and
joy
before
leaving
the
park
the
party
passed
sir
edward
with
his
wife
leaning
on
one
arm
and
jane
on
the
other
pursuing
their
daily
walk
the
baronet
followed
the
carriages
with
his
eyes
and
exchanged
looks
of
the
fondest
love
with
his
children
as
they
drove
slowly
and
respectfully
by
him
and
if
the
glance
which
followed
on
jane
did
not
speak
equal
pleasure
it
surely
denoted
its
proper
proportion
of
paternal
love
you
have
much
reason
to
congratulate
yourself
on
the
happy
termination
of
your
labors
said
the
doctor
with
a
smile
to
the
widow
emily
is
placed
so
far
as
human
foresight
can
judge
in
the
happiest
of
all
stations
a
female
can
be
in
she
is
the
pious
wife
of
a
pious
husband
beloved
and
deserving
of
it
yes
said
wilson
drawing
back
from
following
the
phaeton
with
her
eyes
they
are
as
happy
as
this
world
will
admit
and
what
is
better
they
are
well
prepared
to
meet
any
reverse
of
fortune
which
may
occur
as
well
as
to
discharge
the
duties
on
which
they
have
entered
i
do
not
think
continued
she
musing
that
pendennyss
can
ever
doubt
the
affections
of
such
a
woman
as
emily
i
should
think
not
said
the
doctor
but
what
can
excite
such
a
thought
in
your
breast
and
one
so
much
to
the
prejudice
of
george
the
only
unpleasant
thing
i
have
ever
observed
in
him
said
wilson
gravely
is
the
suspicion
which
induced
him
to
adopt
the
disguise
in
which
he
entered
our
family
he
did
not
adopt
it
madam
chance
and
circumstances
drew
it
around
him
accidentally
and
when
you
consider
the
peculiar
state
of
his
mind
from
the
discovery
of
his
mother
misconduct
his
own
great
wealth
and
rank
it
is
not
so
surprising
that
he
should
yield
to
a
deception
rather
harmless
than
injurious
ives
said
wilson
is
not
wont
to
defend
deceit
nor
do
i
now
madam
replied
the
doctor
with
a
smile
i
acknowledge
the
offence
of
george
myself
wife
and
son
i
remonstrated
at
the
time
upon
principle
i
said
the
end
would
not
justify
the
means
that
a
departure
from
ordinary
rules
of
propriety
was
at
all
times
dangerous
and
seldom
practised
with
impunity
and
you
failed
to
convince
your
hearers
cried
wilson
gaily
a
novelty
in
your
case
my
good
rector
i
thank
you
for
the
compliment
said
the
doctor
i
did
convince
them
as
to
the
truth
of
the
principle
but
the
earl
contended
that
his
case
might
make
an
innocent
exception
he
had
the
vanity
to
think
i
believe
that
by
concealing
his
real
name
he
injured
himself
more
than
any
one
else
and
got
rid
of
the
charge
in
some
such
way
he
is
however
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
position
by
practice
his
sufferings
growing
out
of
the
mistake
of
his
real
character
and
which
could
not
have
happened
had
he
appeared
in
proper
person
having
been
greater
than
he
is
ready
to
acknowledge
if
they
study
the
fate
of
the
donna
julia
and
his
own
weakness
said
the
widow
they
will
have
a
salutary
moral
always
at
hand
to
teach
them
the
importance
of
two
cardinal
virtues
at
least
obedience
and
truth
julia
has
suffered
much
replied
the
doctor
and
although
she
has
returned
to
her
father
the
consequences
of
her
imprudence
are
likely
to
continue
when
once
the
bonds
of
mutual
confidence
and
respect
are
broken
they
may
be
partially
restored
it
is
true
but
never
with
a
warmth
and
reliance
such
as
existed
previously
to
return
however
to
yourself
do
you
not
feel
a
sensation
of
delight
at
the
prosperous
end
of
your
exertions
in
behalf
of
emily
it
is
certainly
pleasant
to
think
we
have
discharged
our
duties
and
the
task
is
much
easier
than
we
are
apt
to
suppose
said
wilson
it
is
only
to
commence
the
foundation
so
that
it
will
be
able
to
support
the
superstructure
i
have
endeavored
to
make
emily
a
christian
i
have
endeavored
to
form
such
a
taste
and
principles
in
her
that
she
would
not
be
apt
to
admire
an
improper
suitor
and
i
have
labored
to
prepare
her
to
discharge
her
continued
duties
through
life
in
such
a
manner
and
with
such
a
faith
as
under
the
providence
of
god
will
result
in
happiness
far
exceeding
anything
she
now
enjoys
in
all
these
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
i
have
succeeded
and
had
occasion
offered
i
would
have
assisted
her
inexperience
through
the
more
delicate
decisions
of
her
sex
though
in
no
instance
would
i
attempt
to
control
them
you
are
right
my
dear
madam
said
the
doctor
taking
her
kindly
by
the
hand
and
had
i
a
daughter
i
would
follow
a
similar
course
give
her
delicacy
religion
and
a
proper
taste
aided
by
the
unseen
influence
of
a
prudent
parent
care
and
the
chances
of
a
woman
for
happiness
would
be
much
greater
than
they
are
and
i
am
entirely
of
your
opinion
prevention
is
at
all
times
better
than
cure
the
end
