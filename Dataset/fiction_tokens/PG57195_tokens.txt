farrington
a
son
of
mars
chapter
i
in
the
military
cradle
to
the
right
under
the
arch
leading
to
the
casemate
barracks
at
triggertown
dwelt
jonadab
larkins
a
deserving
public
servant
who
had
enjoyed
the
proud
position
of
barrack
sergeant
for
some
years
he
was
like
the
old
lady
who
lived
in
the
shoe
he
had
more
children
than
he
could
do
with
comfortably
so
he
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
and
let
them
do
for
themselves
larkins
what
with
cooking
cleaning
and
the
family
washing
had
no
spare
time
on
her
hands
and
except
to
yell
out
shrill
cautions
which
no
one
heeded
or
threats
of
corporal
punishment
which
were
forgotten
as
soon
as
uttered
allowed
her
brood
to
risk
their
lives
as
freely
as
they
pleased
they
had
many
outlets
of
this
kind
one
favourite
amusement
was
to
hang
themselves
to
the
chains
of
the
drawbridge
leading
to
the
barracks
another
to
walk
along
the
brick
edge
of
the
counterscarp
but
that
which
all
enjoyed
most
was
to
watch
the
approach
of
vehicles
in
the
main
thoroughfare
and
to
rush
madly
across
the
road
right
under
the
feet
it
was
often
a
very
near
thing
and
the
nearer
they
went
to
self
immolation
the
better
they
were
pleased
but
the
pitcher
goes
once
too
often
to
the
well
one
fine
day
there
was
a
tremendous
disturbance
in
the
street
a
crowd
gathered
quickly
and
presently
a
message
reached
larkins
that
one
of
her
bairns
had
been
driven
over
and
was
killed
on
is
it
shrieked
the
but
dame
rechab
nor
yet
sennacherib
nor
yet
jemimer
ann
no
it
was
hercules
albert
the
eldest
of
the
family
who
was
just
then
carried
in
and
laid
upon
the
bed
a
lady
a
lady
with
silver
white
hair
and
a
worn
emaciated
face
followed
and
looking
round
with
a
strange
wild
look
in
her
eyes
asked
almost
hysterically
he
much
injured
will
he
live
where
are
the
people
who
call
themselves
his
parents
the
lad
was
only
stunned
and
a
little
water
quickly
brought
him
to
should
have
been
so
grieved
had
he
come
to
harm
went
on
the
lady
was
my
fault
it
has
been
a
terrible
shock
to
me
quite
terrible
but
tell
me
she
looked
hastily
round
then
whispered
to
larkins
did
you
come
by
this
child
the
sergeant
stared
at
her
in
amazement
why
our
own
leastways
the
you
mean
that
you
are
its
mother
she
asked
of
larkins
i
do
do
you
dispute
it
yes
it
may
be
so
but
you
you
man
you
are
not
his
father
you
can
not
be
it
is
impossible
simply
impossible
why
the
child
has
eyes
his
own
dear
eyes
i
could
swear
to
them
among
a
thousand
you
can
not
you
shall
not
deceive
me
how
came
you
by
this
child
not
my
own
son
that
i
deny
said
the
sergeant
he
is
my
she
was
a
widow
when
i
married
her
and
must
have
the
boy
you
can
not
refuse
him
to
me
i
will
buy
him
of
you
will
pay
you
any
price
you
please
but
he
must
leave
this
place
it
is
no
place
for
and
she
gazed
scornfully
at
the
humble
surroundings
the
little
dark
vaulted
room
with
its
one
deep
recessed
window
its
inner
space
curtained
off
to
form
a
second
bedroom
the
litter
and
mess
about
the
floor
is
no
place
for
she
paused
suddenly
and
a
wild
scared
look
came
over
her
face
a
footman
one
of
her
own
people
a
tall
and
pompous
jeames
was
standing
in
the
doorway
and
the
sudden
apparition
seemed
to
put
a
seal
upon
her
tongue
horses
said
the
man
respectfully
enough
although
there
was
an
accent
of
authority
in
his
voice
horses
have
been
standing
nearly
half
an
hour
and
the
coachman
says
yes
come
at
once
at
once
robert
good
people
you
will
understand
my
anxiety
for
the
boy
the
blame
rested
so
entirely
upon
us
it
is
an
immense
relief
to
know
that
he
is
not
then
watching
her
opportunity
she
hissed
out
with
frenzied
eagerness
a
word
to
a
soul
not
a
syllable
as
you
value
future
and
my
peace
i
will
come
again
or
sooner
unattended
h
sh
for
sake
h
sh
and
she
hurriedly
left
the
room
blowed
said
the
sergeant
drawing
a
long
breath
that
the
rummest
game
what
does
it
mean
missus
can
you
tell
larkins
met
his
inquiring
eyes
quite
steadily
and
if
she
was
conscious
of
any
mystery
no
suspicion
of
it
could
be
traced
in
her
voice
and
manner
must
be
off
her
head
my
notion
clean
stark
staring
mine
too
yon
flunkey
was
her
keeper
i
expect
bound
to
look
after
her
and
keep
her
out
of
mischief
make
a
fine
talk
in
the
barracks
this
see
why
it
should
i
let
on
if
i
was
you
gossip
about
it
at
the
canteen
sergeant
or
at
the
mess
the
good
a
docile
and
obedient
husband
was
sergeant
larkins
who
through
all
the
years
of
his
married
life
had
accepted
his
will
as
law
larkins
was
a
buxom
dame
who
made
a
home
comfortable
for
him
so
long
as
he
allowed
her
to
rule
right
a
folly
always
to
talk
leastways
when
nothing
to
talk
about
and
the
freaks
of
a
mad
woman
amount
to
much
we
hear
no
more
about
nor
did
they
for
days
nay
weeks
but
months
and
the
episode
was
fading
from
their
memories
at
least
from
that
of
the
sergeant
when
the
lady
suddenly
unattended
and
alone
she
looked
suspiciously
about
her
as
she
entered
the
room
could
not
come
before
i
have
been
watched
even
now
i
fear
they
are
on
my
track
quick
where
is
the
boy
hercules
albert
was
where
he
and
his
brothers
generally
were
in
mischief
must
see
him
my
heart
yearns
for
him
and
to
think
that
i
should
find
him
thus
how
inscrutable
are
the
ways
of
providence
my
sweet
my
pet
it
is
balm
to
my
wounded
heart
and
she
kissed
and
fondled
the
boy
regardless
of
the
mud
with
which
his
dirty
face
was
encrusted
and
of
his
own
evident
perturbation
and
objection
to
these
endearments
i
must
not
waste
time
i
may
be
disturbed
before
i
have
said
my
say
listen
you
will
let
me
have
the
child
you
shall
name
your
own
price
i
will
ask
no
questions
keep
your
own
counsel
you
shall
not
divulge
your
no
secrets
to
divulge
said
the
sergeant
stoutly
you
buy
a
brat
of
mine
as
though
he
were
a
congo
on
the
west
larkins
see
what
the
lady
means
the
practical
wife
interposed
larkins
was
quite
quiet
and
as
she
looked
her
strange
visitor
full
in
the
face
she
will
explain
do
you
wish
to
adopt
the
child
do
and
more
i
wish
to
educate
him
to
be
worthy
of
his
birth
and
of
that
position
which
he
must
some
day
come
to
in
spite
of
all
he
shall
have
all
my
love
while
i
live
all
my
possessions
after
death
they
are
his
by
right
indefeasible
has
he
not
eyes
is
he
not
my
no
more
madam
larkins
interrupted
her
you
are
in
sober
serious
earnest
if
you
mean
what
you
say
you
would
not
part
with
the
child
not
like
this
have
seven
jonadab
and
it
is
a
fine
chance
for
one
if
you
are
in
earnest
madam
this
prove
to
you
that
i
am
in
earnest
said
the
lady
taking
from
her
purse
a
roll
of
bank
notes
are
fifty
pounds
spend
it
in
outfit
get
him
proper
clothes
books
boxes
all
that
a
boy
wants
when
he
is
going
to
a
school
within
a
fortnight
you
shall
hear
from
me
through
a
lawyer
i
will
send
full
instructions
and
a
confidential
messenger
who
shall
take
herbert
herbert
he
must
be
called
not
hercules
herbert
that
your
own
name
asked
larkins
rather
hurriedly
i
am
lady
farrington
you
have
then
heard
the
name
before
you
know
me
say
you
know
me
that
you
knew
herbert
confess
that
herbert
was
lady
you
are
mistaken
i
never
knew
any
herbert
farrington
never
in
all
my
life
lady
farrington
shook
her
head
sadly
you
know
and
will
not
speak
you
may
do
the
child
irreparable
harm
no
matter
it
is
sufficient
for
the
present
that
he
is
mine
that
he
passes
into
my
keeping
that
i
am
free
to
lavish
upon
him
the
whole
of
my
yearning
affection
the
rest
will
come
all
in
good
time
heaven
bless
you
herbert
and
prosper
you
and
bring
you
some
day
to
your
she
kissed
the
bewildered
boy
repeatedly
shook
hands
with
his
father
and
mother
and
then
left
the
place
like
it
i
blowed
if
i
do
said
the
sergeant
fair
on
the
youngster
it
to
give
him
over
to
that
old
idiot
why
you
may
tell
she
is
mad
by
her
talk
and
her
ways
maybe
fatten
him
up
and
eat
him
or
perhaps
turn
him
into
a
papist
or
a
frenchman
he
a
fool
larkins
but
more
my
business
than
it
is
yours
after
all
and
the
harm
she
promise
fair
enough
and
these
notes
a
pretty
certain
proof
that
she
is
all
above
board
we
lose
sight
of
the
boy
not
altogether
stipulate
that
we
are
to
see
him
sometimes
and
then
he
go
far
wrong
but
you
hold
your
tongue
what
got
to
do
none
of
your
blabbing
or
gossipping
about
if
they
ask
you
become
of
herkles
why
say
got
into
the
duke
of
school
and
be
back
for
ever
so
wish
he
had
i
could
see
my
way
then
but
i
now
and
it
beats
me
how
you
can
take
it
all
so
the
honest
sergeant
was
chiefly
concerned
as
to
the
little
future
prospects
but
although
he
was
not
a
man
of
keen
intelligence
or
of
suspicious
nature
he
was
also
a
little
exercised
as
to
the
strangeness
of
the
whole
affair
he
might
explain
the
conduct
by
calling
it
eccentricity
or
madness
but
he
could
not
quite
understand
the
part
his
wife
had
played
he
would
have
been
still
more
perplexed
had
he
returned
unexpectedly
from
the
canteen
that
evening
after
all
the
children
were
in
bed
he
would
have
found
his
wife
engrossed
with
the
treasures
of
a
little
box
which
she
had
emptied
on
her
lap
a
few
gilt
buttons
a
lock
of
fair
hair
a
bow
of
ribbon
that
was
all
yet
she
wept
bitterly
as
she
kissed
them
again
and
again
and
restored
them
one
by
one
to
the
sacred
box
reverentially
as
though
each
was
a
relic
in
her
eyes
chapter
ii
the
farrington
family
farrington
court
was
the
of
the
farrington
family
where
dowagers
and
heirs
apparent
resided
according
as
it
might
happen
to
suit
the
lady
farrington
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
had
occupied
it
for
years
ever
since
the
death
of
her
husband
and
her
sons
when
the
bulk
of
the
property
with
the
title
had
passed
to
rupert
farrington
the
late
nephew
sir
rupert
lived
now
at
farrington
hall
with
his
wife
and
one
son
of
his
own
old
lady
farrington
in
her
losses
and
her
loneliness
was
a
woman
much
to
be
pitied
she
had
seen
her
children
die
all
of
them
but
one
he
also
was
dead
but
miserably
and
at
a
distance
probably
from
home
her
husband
she
had
mourned
last
of
all
at
a
time
when
she
had
most
needed
strength
and
support
the
new
baronet
did
not
treat
her
well
she
was
no
doubt
fortified
by
ample
settlements
farrington
court
was
hers
also
by
right
inalienable
during
her
lifetime
yet
sir
rupert
had
had
it
in
his
power
to
put
her
to
infinite
pain
and
wittingly
or
unwittingly
had
not
spared
her
in
the
least
the
ejectment
from
the
hall
her
once
happy
home
the
scene
of
her
married
life
where
all
her
children
had
been
born
and
where
all
were
buried
save
one
had
been
carried
out
with
an
almost
brutal
abruptness
which
cut
the
poor
afflicted
soul
to
the
quick
sir
rupert
had
driven
hard
bargains
with
her
also
in
taking
over
the
house
and
the
estate
had
insisted
upon
the
uttermost
farthing
had
denied
her
many
possessions
small
and
great
which
she
valued
as
reminding
her
of
the
past
but
which
were
his
according
to
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
his
unkindness
pursued
her
even
to
the
house
which
she
might
still
call
her
own
but
hers
was
only
a
after
all
and
as
farrington
court
must
in
due
course
lapse
back
to
the
family
sir
rupert
felt
bound
he
said
for
his
own
and
his
sake
to
see
that
the
place
came
to
no
harm
his
interference
and
inquisitiveness
were
in
consequence
constant
and
vexatious
he
insisted
upon
inspecting
the
house
regularly
he
must
satisfy
himself
that
the
repairs
were
duly
executed
that
the
gardens
and
glass
houses
were
properly
kept
up
and
that
no
timber
was
cut
down
he
did
not
scruple
to
tell
lady
farrington
that
he
looked
upon
her
as
a
tenant
and
by
no
means
a
good
one
to
whom
he
would
gladly
give
notice
to
quit
if
he
could
these
first
causes
for
irritation
and
dislike
deepened
in
time
to
positive
hatred
lady
farrington
came
by
degrees
to
fear
sir
rupert
with
a
terror
that
was
almost
abject
and
when
we
fear
others
to
this
extent
we
undoubtedly
hate
them
very
cordially
too
her
terror
was
not
difficult
to
explain
it
had
its
grounds
in
the
conviction
that
she
was
more
or
less
in
his
power
there
was
a
secret
which
she
had
as
she
thought
kept
hitherto
entirely
to
herself
but
which
he
as
time
passed
and
brought
him
opportunities
for
close
observation
had
eventually
discovered
she
herself
knew
and
by
degrees
she
felt
that
he
also
knew
that
her
mind
was
a
little
unsound
lady
farrington
had
been
an
eccentric
woman
even
in
her
lifetime
her
ways
had
been
odd
her
manners
strange
she
was
given
to
curious
likes
and
dislikes
which
showed
themselves
in
extraordinary
ways
thus
she
hated
the
wife
of
a
neighbouring
squire
an
upstart
woman
certainly
but
nothing
worse
than
or
whenever
this
lady
called
at
the
hall
the
chair
on
which
she
had
sat
was
sent
to
the
upholsterers
to
be
on
one
occasion
when
she
came
at
the
time
of
afternoon
tea
lady
farrington
threw
the
cup
and
saucer
her
visitor
had
used
into
the
fire
declaring
it
should
never
be
drunk
out
of
again
a
more
unnatural
antipathy
was
that
which
she
long
entertained
for
her
second
son
a
dislike
which
had
caused
him
much
misery
and
her
much
subsequent
anguish
of
mind
as
against
all
this
she
had
been
extravagantly
fond
of
her
husband
and
her
when
the
former
left
her
even
for
a
few
hours
she
kept
his
hat
and
in
the
room
with
her
as
though
to
cheat
herself
into
the
belief
that
he
was
really
in
the
house
the
latter
she
coddled
and
cossetted
to
such
an
extent
that
he
grew
up
weakly
and
died
young
but
after
all
her
bitter
trials
and
heavy
blows
her
eccentricity
had
developed
so
rapidly
that
it
might
fairly
be
called
by
a
stronger
name
at
first
she
shut
herself
up
in
a
private
chamber
surrounded
by
the
relics
of
happier
days
and
brooded
sorrowfully
over
and
all
manner
of
childish
toys
then
she
went
to
the
other
extreme
threw
off
her
weeds
and
decked
out
in
gay
colours
and
with
a
long
white
veil
drove
about
the
country
lanes
in
a
carriage
with
grey
horses
as
though
she
were
a
bride
when
sir
persecution
had
grown
into
a
serious
annoyance
she
concentrated
upon
him
all
the
aversion
she
had
once
levelled
at
more
innocent
objects
of
dislike
she
never
would
have
admitted
him
to
the
house
but
as
he
would
take
no
denial
she
consoled
herself
by
throwing
open
all
the
windows
and
doors
whatever
the
weather
directly
he
had
left
the
house
insisting
that
the
place
was
unfit
for
habitation
until
it
had
been
thoroughly
aired
then
saying
his
threats
and
menaces
put
her
in
bodily
fear
she
got
into
the
habit
of
packing
all
her
most
treasured
belongings
in
one
or
two
trunks
which
she
kept
locked
in
her
bedroom
under
her
own
eye
in
readiness
as
it
were
for
immediate
flight
for
a
long
time
sir
rupert
seemed
to
take
but
little
notice
of
her
vagaries
when
the
county
folk
commiserated
him
and
inquired
after
poor
lady
farrington
he
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
touched
his
forehead
in
a
melancholy
pitying
way
she
had
had
so
much
trouble
in
her
time
poor
soul
it
was
very
dreadful
of
course
but
what
could
be
done
she
had
every
care
and
attention
he
could
secure
for
her
he
went
to
see
her
frequently
in
spite
of
her
strange
dislike
so
did
his
wife
he
did
his
duty
by
her
as
well
as
he
possibly
could
she
was
harmless
and
as
he
thought
perfectly
safe
she
had
good
servants
about
her
he
himself
saw
to
that
and
there
was
no
necessity
to
put
her
under
restraint
unless
indeed
she
became
very
much
worse
if
her
malady
increased
to
the
extent
of
endangering
the
safety
of
those
about
her
or
of
the
house
by
no
means
a
secondary
consideration
with
him
why
then
as
a
last
alternative
she
must
be
shut
up
he
did
not
conceal
from
her
however
that
this
would
ultimately
be
her
fate
more
than
once
he
warned
her
that
he
knew
her
condition
and
would
some
day
be
compelled
to
take
steps
to
make
her
secure
but
he
said
this
with
no
object
but
to
prove
his
power
and
lady
farrington
would
probably
have
been
left
to
pursue
the
curious
tenour
of
her
ways
had
not
her
mania
taken
a
direction
which
threatened
to
be
distinctly
inconvenient
to
sir
rupert
of
all
the
woes
which
lady
farrington
suffered
the
keenest
perhaps
was
remorse
for
her
treatment
of
her
second
son
as
has
been
said
she
had
looked
upon
him
always
with
disfavour
herbert
never
could
please
where
another
more
tenderly
cared
for
would
have
been
gently
corrected
he
was
called
wilful
obstinate
perverse
and
sharply
chided
and
admonished
he
it
was
who
was
always
in
the
wrong
he
it
was
who
led
the
other
boys
into
mischief
it
was
his
fault
or
said
to
be
his
when
the
boat
upset
or
the
ice
broke
or
the
gun
went
off
or
any
mishap
occurred
as
he
grew
to
estate
his
indifference
did
not
soften
into
warmer
feelings
poor
herbert
failed
at
school
and
college
the
obvious
consequence
of
early
neglect
he
could
not
pass
the
army
examination
although
he
longed
to
wear
a
red
coat
all
he
could
do
was
to
roam
the
woods
with
dog
and
gun
at
farrington
consorting
with
grooms
and
keepers
enjoying
an
open
air
life
the
more
because
he
thereby
escaped
from
the
house
and
his
sneers
but
these
last
although
thus
rarely
encountered
became
at
length
unbearable
and
one
fine
morning
herbert
was
not
to
be
found
he
had
gone
off
leaving
a
note
to
say
that
pursuit
or
inquiry
would
be
fruitless
as
he
meant
to
leave
england
for
good
and
all
nothing
should
induce
him
to
return
to
farrington
hall
the
blow
fell
heaviest
upon
lady
farrington
who
felt
that
she
had
been
principally
to
blame
prompt
search
was
accordingly
instituted
but
all
to
no
purpose
some
said
that
he
had
emigrated
some
that
he
had
enlisted
others
that
he
had
gone
to
sea
no
one
ever
saw
him
in
the
flesh
again
only
lady
farrington
in
whom
the
catastrophe
had
worked
a
strong
revulsion
of
feeling
was
positive
that
she
had
seen
him
in
the
spirit
more
than
once
he
had
appeared
to
her
last
of
all
just
after
the
death
of
algernon
the
eldest
son
nor
had
he
appeared
alone
with
him
was
a
comely
girl
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
herbert
had
pointed
significantly
to
the
child
and
lady
farrington
interpreted
the
gesture
to
mean
that
he
and
his
son
were
now
the
rightful
heirs
of
the
farrington
title
and
estates
this
vision
she
tremulously
described
to
her
husband
and
to
others
but
it
was
treated
even
by
sir
algernon
as
a
mere
dream
or
the
hallucination
of
an
brain
nothing
more
would
have
been
thought
of
the
circumstances
of
disappearance
and
shadowy
return
except
as
a
great
and
irreparable
sorrow
but
for
the
arrival
of
a
mysterious
packet
a
year
or
two
later
which
contained
a
lock
of
light
curly
hair
and
a
scrap
of
paper
on
which
was
written
in
handwriting
kinder
to
my
after
this
a
frantic
desire
to
discover
and
do
justice
to
her
injured
son
possessed
lady
farrington
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
objects
in
life
the
family
lawyers
were
called
in
detectives
public
and
private
were
employed
advertisements
were
inserted
in
the
agony
columns
of
the
journals
with
the
largest
circulation
in
the
world
as
substantial
rewards
were
offered
numbers
of
sons
were
promptly
forthcoming
but
not
one
of
them
was
the
right
one
nor
was
any
information
which
could
be
relied
upon
obtained
neither
as
to
whether
herbert
farrington
himself
was
alive
or
dead
or
whether
in
the
latter
case
he
had
left
any
heirs
lady
farrington
endured
another
and
a
more
bitter
disappointment
than
any
she
had
hitherto
experienced
in
life
it
was
not
till
long
after
the
death
of
her
husband
and
her
occupation
of
farrington
court
that
the
old
theory
as
to
the
existence
of
a
grandson
was
revived
by
her
why
or
wherefore
no
one
could
understand
had
she
come
upon
any
traces
of
the
son
or
was
it
merely
that
her
mind
in
its
increasing
weakness
worked
back
into
old
grooves
be
the
cause
what
it
might
lady
farrington
seemed
at
times
strangely
positive
that
she
should
find
the
missing
dear
one
or
his
representative
after
all
she
often
hinted
darkly
and
mysteriously
that
there
was
a
great
surprise
in
store
for
sir
rupert
something
he
little
expected
would
assuredly
come
to
pass
when
matters
were
properly
ripe
there
was
no
hurry
it
was
better
to
make
all
sure
before
the
mine
was
sprung
no
link
in
the
chain
must
be
wanting
but
all
would
be
ready
ere
long
then
let
sir
rupert
look
to
himself
all
this
gave
the
baronet
who
was
really
the
man
in
possession
but
little
uneasiness
as
the
next
heir
he
had
heard
long
ago
of
the
eager
inquiries
for
the
missing
herbert
and
although
he
had
resented
them
then
he
had
accepted
their
impotent
conclusion
as
an
unanswerable
proof
that
his
presumptive
rights
were
not
to
be
impugned
on
the
death
of
sir
algernon
his
title
had
not
been
disputed
and
he
had
succeeded
as
a
matter
of
course
lady
farrington
had
made
no
protest
there
was
no
shadow
of
foundation
for
a
protest
and
if
not
then
would
any
person
in
his
sober
senses
think
of
disputing
his
rights
now
when
he
had
a
firm
grip
of
the
title
property
and
place
only
an
old
mad
woman
would
harbour
such
an
idea
even
she
would
hardly
dare
to
raise
the
question
openly
after
such
a
lapse
of
years
and
who
would
believe
her
if
she
did
he
told
her
so
very
roughly
when
her
allusions
became
more
and
more
significant
he
warned
her
too
that
had
better
be
careful
what
she
said
or
did
it
was
a
fact
well
known
to
the
whole
that
she
was
quite
unable
to
take
care
of
herself
that
she
was
not
responsible
for
her
actions
that
her
proper
place
was
an
asylum
and
she
might
come
to
that
yet
if
one
day
when
he
had
been
taunting
thus
longer
and
more
bitterly
than
usual
she
was
goaded
into
making
an
incautious
reply

rupert
your
time
is
fast
drawing
to
a
new
craze
is
this
lady
farrington
he
said
laughing
scornfully
but
with
a
black
look
on
his
face
sir
was
a
hard
dark
face
with
full
eyes
rather
prominent
and
a
long
drooping
black
moustache
when
he
looked
black
it
was
not
a
pleasant
face
to
see
is
nothing
new
rupert
i
have
waited
patiently
hopefully
i
thought
the
end
would
never
come
it
is
near
at
hand
now
although
the
consummation
has
been
long
language
is
as
usual
clear
and
perspicuous
yet
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
ask
you
to
she
said
as
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
hissed
out
her
words
slowly

one

short

i
choose
i
can
produce
the
rightful
heir

can

i
will
miserable
fool
you
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
claim
to
the
title

my
grandson
son
lives
and
you
must
make
way
for
son
how
do
you
know
that
what
proof
have
you
youth
himself
he
has
been
under
my
charge
these
five
years
past
and
more
i
found
him
i
myself
found
him
i
knew
i
could
not
err
he
had
eyes
he
is
image
he
must
have
more
proof
than
this
if
he
is
to
make
good
his
case
in
a
court
of
law
said
sir
rupert
coolly
know
it
and
the
proof
shall
be
forthcoming
every
link
in
the
right
if
it
is
to
be
war
to
the
knife
so
let
it
be
but
i
tell
you
plainly
that
no
one
will
believe
a
word
you
will
believe
my
beautiful
boy
my
own
boy
when
they
hear
his
story
from
his
own
sweet
lips
he
shall
come
forward
himself
when
the
occasion
is
ripe
for
him
to
is

now
asked
sir
rupert
carelessly
but
with
deeply
cunning
intent
she
laughed
in
his
face
no
sir
rupert
i
am
not
to
be
so
easily
beguiled
he
is
safe
quite
safe
to
be
produced
at
exactly
the
right
sir
rupert
gave
her
another
fierce
look
which
boded
her
no
good
but
he
said
nothing
more
he
was
not
exactly
disconcerted
by
her
positive
assertions
which
he
only
half
believed
yet
his
peace
of
mind
had
been
rudely
assailed
that
he
must
discover
the
whereabouts
of
this
mysterious
claimant
and
test
the
accuracy
of
lady
statements
was
clear
it
was
equally
clear
that
he
must
if
possible
put
a
gag
upon
the
old
woman
and
remove
her
where
she
could
work
no
further
harm

albert
or
herbert
as
he
was
henceforth
to
be
called
was
not
a
little
taken
aback
by
the
sudden
change
in
his
circumstances
which
followed
lady
supposed
recognition
of
him
to
be
measured
for
a
suit
of
black
cloth
which
befitted
best
the
notion
of
gentility
to
have
a
brand
new
box
painted
green
with
sundry
new
shirts
new
boots
and
a

all
his
own
these
were
so
many
delicious
surprises
the
full
effect
of
which
was
fully
borne
in
upon
him
by
the
envy
of
the
rest
of
the
family
but
it
was
a
wrench
to
him
when
the
time
came
to
leave
his
home
the
only
one
he
had
ever
known
to
lose
the
companionship
of
his
playmates
and
the
warm
though
affection
of
the
sergeant
and
his
wife
a

at

perhaps
and
live
like
a
the
prospect
was
brilliant
but
remote
herbert
as
a
child
of
the
barracks
had
been
brought
up
to
believe
that
officers
were
almost
superior
beings
he
saw
his
father
the
sergeant
and
all
soldiers
salute
them
always
and
pay
them
extraordinary
deference
when
in
uniform
they
were
resplendent
in
crimson
and
gold
when
out
of
it
they
drove
and
played
cricket
and
owned
dogs
all
of
which
herbert
would
have
liked
to
have
done
too
yet
the
of
some
day
becoming
an
officer
himself
did
not
reconcile
him
to
separation
from
the
best
friends
he
had
in
the
world
and
as
he
left
triggertown
casemates
he
wept
bitterly
and
refused
to
be
comforted
if
life
looked
black
and
forbidding
then
it
was
a
thousand
times
worse
when
he
got
to
school
a
old
man
it
was
bellhouse
lady
solicitor
escorted
him
thither
and
snubbed
him
all
the
way
the
old
lawyer
was
a
little
sick
of
her
caprices
and
considered
this
last
the
most
serious
of
all
but
it
was
none
of
fault
and
the
poor
lad
did
not
deserve
to
be
made
to
answer
for
lady
sins
at
school
he
was
left
stranded
like
a
waif
of
the
sea
upon
an
unknown
shore
presently
the
natives
troops
of
little
savage
swooped
down
upon
him
to
scalp
and
torture
him
he
was
pestered
with
questions
and
his
hair
pulled
his
strange
was
jeered
at
and
given
to
the
winds
but
the
instincts
of
are
strong
and
herbert
if
new
to
school
life
was
not
new
to
the
use
of
his
fists
his
tormentors
were
numerous
but
with
one
or
two
exceptions
were
not
much
older
or
bigger
than
himself
and
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
blows
and
hard
knocks
he
was
physically
well
able
to
take
care
of
himself
presently
a
from
the
shoulder
relieved
him
of
the
most
troublesome
of
his
assailants
and
a
second
planted
upon
the
nose
of
a
tall
bully
proved
that
herbert
thought
nothing
of
disparity
in
height
when
disposing
of
his
foes
boys
are
sensibly
affected
by
the
display
of
pluck
especially
against
superior
odds
and
herbert
soon
gained
for
himself
the
respect
due
to
his
prowess
and
immunity
from
further
annoyance
he
was
vexed
and
irritated
no
more
but
he
went
to
his
bed
a
far
more
cleanly
and
luxurious
couch
than
that
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
in
the
crowded
casemate
at
triggertown
with
a
sad
and
sorrowful
heart
there
are
no
woes
so
acute
as
those
of
early
youth
happily
they
are
as
transient
as
they
are
intense
herbert
at
night
was
in
the
depths
of
woe
next
morning
he
was
already
in
a
fair
way
to
recover
his
spirits
and
before
the
day
was
out
in
the
excitement
of
the
new
life
opening
before
him
he
had
forgotten
his
sorrows
and
was
as
happy
as
a
bird
he
was
just
the
boy
to
get
on
at
school
brisk
and
buoyant
in
disposition
with
a
vigorous
frame
a
predilection
for
games
of
every
kind
in
which
with
a
little
experience
he
soon
excelled
he
rapidly
advanced
in
the
estimation
of
his
fellows
he
was
liberal
and
too
which
did
not
make
him
the
less
appreciated
and
he
had
plenty
to
give
away
people
as
boys
call
their
friends
were
evidently
of
the
right
sort
the
old
lady
with
the
hair
and
large
mournful
eyes
who
came
to
see
him
regularly
every
month
was
right
royal
in
her
tips
and
not
to
him
alone
but
to
any
whom
he
called
particular
friends
he
got
tuck
baskets
continually
and
presents
of
all
kinds
to
which
others
administered
as
freely
as
himself
these
are
substantial
grounds
for
school
popularity
and
herbert
enjoyed
it
in
the
highest
degree
as
he
grew
in
years
and
developed
in
strength
and
good
looks
lady
affectionate
admiration
knew
no
bounds
she
lavished
caresses
on
him
without
ceasing
declaring
that
he
was
daily
becoming
more
and
more
fitted
for
the
station
which
would
some
day
be
his
yes
the
end
can
not
be
far
off
now
she
said
one
day
as
she
sat
in
the
holding
hand
in
hers
and
patting
it
from
time
to
time
in
the
fulness
of
her
contentment
shall
gainsay
your
claim
when
they
see
you
thus
my
living
image
my
son
my
son
my
lost
unhappy
son
and
in
a
moment
she
was
in
a
paroxysm
of
tears
herbert
was
quite
accustomed
to
her
now
at
first
he
had
been
dismayed
by
her
sudden
outbursts
the
rapid
transition
from
joy
to
sorrow
from
smiles
to
hysterical
tears
were
sufficient
to
frighten
him
and
when
to
these
were
added
her
wild
talk
her
bitter
her
mysterious
hints
of
his
coming
greatness
he
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
or
say
but
by
degrees
he
became
familiar
with
her
eccentricities
and
he
felt
that
although
she
might
be
queer
she
was
certainly
uncommonly
kind
can
not
control
myself
when
i
think
of
the
miserable
past
but
please
god
in
you
i
shall
make
some
atonement
for
my
sins
and
soon
soon
for
the
time
draws
nigh
you
are
equal
herbert
i
trust
to
a
great
and
arduous
trial
he
was
now
nearly
seventeen
tall
and
for
his
age
and
as
he
shook
his
light
curls
and
looked
steadily
at
her
with
his
clear
honest
eyes
he
seemed
the
incarnation
of
youth
and
hope
am
game
for
anything
lady
farrington
only
try
me
face
the
whole
world
if
you
asked
own
brave
boy
the
struggle
may
be
sharp
but
with
such
a
spirit
the
victory
is
certain
to
be
may
i
know
what
it
is
that
i
have
to
do
time
draws
nigh
it
depends
only
on
you
and
your
fitness
to
play
your
part
you
have
not
neglected
your
opportunities
i
know
jiggs
gives
you
a
high
character
you
have
profited
by
his
studies
you
have
learnt
to
ride
and
shoot
and
when
you
come
to
your
own
you
will
comport
yourself
as
an
english
gentleman
am
a
gentleman
born
then
the
best
she
replied
proudly
are
why
conceal
it
longer
here
you
have
for
reasons
been
still
known
as
herbert
larkins
my
ward
but
you
are
really
my
grandson
the
only
child
of
herbert
my
second
boy
you
are
sir
herbert
farrington
the
rightful
heir
of
the
family
honours
of
an
old
name
and
wide
this
certain
quite
certain
at
least
to
me
i
have
never
doubted
from
the
first
my
instinct
assured
me
i
was
right
when
i
recognised
you
in
triggertown
but
as
the
world
needs
more
material
proof
i
have
sought
them
out
and
hold
them
now
all
but
one
this
also
i
should
have
possessed
had
not
one
person
failed
was
that
larkins
she
alone
can
tell
us
what
we
want
to
know
and
she
has
most
unaccountably
hesitated
or
refused
to
speak
this
is
why
i
have
broken
with
her
why
i
have
forbidden
them
to
come
and
see
you
these
honest
people
had
paid
several
visits
to
herbert
at
school
visits
he
had
received
with
delight
they
had
ceased
suddenly
and
he
had
wondered
greatly
thereat
if
my
mother
if
larkins
larkins
is
not
your
mother
herbert
of
that
you
may
rest
was
as
good
as
one
to
me
always
i
know
that
but
if
she
is
the
only
person
who
can
help
us
in
this
matter
was
it
prudent
to
break
with
her
altogether
herbert
asked
very
pertinently
was
annoyed
angry
and
they
were
proud
i
will
seek
them
out
again
they
are
necessary
to
us
larkins
shall
speak
and
we
will
proceed
at
once
to
establish
your
claim
my
patience
is
exhausted
and
cup
is
this
conversation
occurred
at
a
time
mentioned
in
a
previous
chapter
when
her
relations
with
sir
rupert
had
become
more
and
more
constrained
war
had
long
been
imminent
between
them
but
a
rupture
had
been
precipitated
by
the
overbearing
harshness
of
his
ways
she
had
spoken
therefore
a
little
rashly
and
prematurely
perhaps
and
in
doing
so
had
shown
her
hand
she
had
practically
thrown
down
the
glove
daring
him
to
do
his
worst
he
accepted
the
challenge
and
acted
with
a
promptitude
and
determination
for
which
the
poor
old
lady
was
certainly
no
match
his
first
step
was
to
put
a
watch
upon
lady
movements
oozenam
the
private
detective
was
employed
who
set
about
his
task
with
his
usual
skill
and
despatch
within
a
week
or
two
he
came
with
his
first
report
farrington
goes
once
every
month
often
twice
to
deadham
school
in
essex
she
has
done
so
these
five
years
past
and
course
the
cub
her
is
there
well
ward
of
her
herbert
larkins
is
at
school
there
he
is
now
seventeen
years
of
age
is
tall
and
well
grown
has
fair
curly
hair
and
greyish
blue
eyes
her
ladyship
is
said
to
take
an
immense
interest
in
him
their
interviews
are
long
she
must
be
very
liberal
to
him
the
lad
is
always
well
provided
with
money
which
he
spends
freely
he
is
a
fair
scholar
has
been
taught
especially
to
ride
and
shoot
has
learnt
foreign
languages
and
all
is
enough
oozenam
you
have
handsomely
earned
your
has
gone
very
far
sir
rupert
said
to
himself
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
an
idiot
i
have
been
not
to
have
observed
her
more
closely
but
let
us
hope
it
is
not
too
late
even
and
then
after
a
long
cogitation
he
called
for
his
carriage
and
driving
first
into
the
neighbouring
country
town
where
he
made
one
or
two
calls
he
bade
the
coachman
next
proceed
to
farrington
court
he
asked
for
lady
farrington
and
was
in
due
course
ushered
into
her
private
boudoir
time
has
come
lady
farrington
as
you
were
good
enough
to
say
some
time
back
the
time
for
plain
speaking
i
mean
to
put
an
end
to
your
tomfooleries
once
for
all
so
long
as
they
merely
made
you
appear
ridiculous
i
could
have
borne
with
you
although
you
scandalized
our
name
but
i
can
not
permit
you
to
plot
against
me
and
mine
without
protest
and
something
she
asked
in
a
voice
which
anger
and
agitation
combined
to
make
nearly
inarticulate
have
discovered
all
you
have
kept
your
secret
well
but
i
have
found
it
out
this
pretender
is
my
own
grandson
i
have
the
will
not
bear
the
test
of
legal
scrutiny
you
know
that
on
the
contrary
i
can
show
that
the
whole
affair
is
a
conspiracy
from
beginning
to
end
that
this
larkins
is
an
adventurer
will
not
harm
him
surely
it
is
i
only
i
who
am
to
shall
hand
him
over
to
the
police
prosecute
him
and
make
him
pay
dearly
for
his
attempt
to
would
not
dare
she
cried
aghast
surprise
and
indignation
combined
to
confuse
her
mind
and
she
did
not
pause
to
consider
that
he
had
no
grounds
of
procedure
that
his
threats
were
vain
and
could
never
be
put
into
execution
shall
not
spare
him
nor
you
shall
take
the
consequences
i
will
proclaim
you
to
be
the
villain
that
you
are
will
tear
you
from
your
present
exalted
station
and
will
send
you
back
to
your
former
poverty
and
rags
you
shall
be
dispossessed
you
shall
disgorge
the
rents
and
all
that
you
have
improperly
acquired
you
he
merely
laughed
at
her
mockingly
and
rudely
which
exasperated
her
beyond
all
bounds
sir
you
shall
not
remain
here
another
second
to
insult
me
begone
or
he
only
laughed
more
loudly
and
mockingly
than
before
instantly
her
rage
passed
into
fury
which
seemed
uncontrollable
she
cried
again
snatching
up
a
paper
knife
and
rushing
on
him
with
so
much
intention
that
sir
rupert
precipitately
retired
she
followed
him
downstairs
with
a
wild
shriek
little
recking
how
completely
she
was
playing
into
his
hands
the
butler
had
just
admitted
several
other
visitors
who
heard
and
saw
all
that
passed
sir
rupert
went
up
to
them
apparently
for
protection
but
his
first
words
showed
that
he
was
eager
for
more
than
this
you
have
arrived
most
opportunely
you
can
see
for
yourselves
it
is
clearly
not
safe
to
leave
her
any
longer
at
the
butler
had
quelled
poor
lady
farrington
almost
instantly
but
although
he
held
her
back
she
was
still
furious
and
foamed
at
the
mouth
we
can
not
refuse
the
certificate
said
burkinshaw
of
bootle
a
local
magistrate
and
magnate
henry
quite
agrees
with
me
and
the
doctors
have
no
manner
of
doubt
poor
woman
she
ought
clearly
to
be
put
under
and
she
was
without
unnecessary
delay
thus
herbert
larkins
lost
his
protectress
just
when
his
fortune
seemed
close
at
hand
the
cup
was
dashed
away
just
before
he
had
lifted
it
to
his
lips
with
consequences
which
were
by
no
means
pleasant
to
himself
as
will
be
seen
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
iv
taking
the
shilling
herbert
larkins
was
in
the
when
he
was
summoned
to
see
a
gentleman
who
had
called
come
from
lady
farrington
said
his
visitor
rather
abruptly
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
sinister
look
upon
his
face
is
well
i
hope
nothing
has
happened
i
half
expected
her
or
is
well
but
she
can
not
come
here
and
wishes
you
to
go
to
her
at
once
you
are
aware
no
doubt
time
then
has
arrived
herbert
said
a
little
incautiously
has
arrived
you
are
ready
i
presume
must
speak
to
jiggs
i
can
not
leave
the
school
without
his
permission
of
is
all
arranged
when
you
have
got
your
belongings
together
we
will
start
you
are
not
to
return
here
you
know
that
i
presume
are
going
to
join
lady
farrington
the
visitor
bowed
assent
an
hour
or
two
later
they
were
in
the
train
and
on
the
road
to
london
there
was
little
conversation
between
them
herbert
was
shy
and
his
companion
by
no
means
talkative
or
sociable
does
lady
farrington
live
herbert
asked
really
know
never
told
me
herbert
replied
looking
rather
shamefaced
is
a
strange
person
of
that
you
must
be
aware
it
is
impossible
to
account
for
all
she
says
and
has
always
been
most
kind
to
me
herbert
said
stoutly
doubt
the
other
replied
drily
perhaps
that
was
a
form
of
eccentricity
people
are
sometimes
too
affectionate
by
herbert
would
have
liked
some
explanation
of
this
speech
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
ask
for
it
he
only
knew
that
he
began
to
dislike
this
man
excessively
and
hoped
they
might
never
have
much
to
say
to
each
other
arrived
in
london
they
drove
from
one
terminus
to
another
fresh
tickets
were
taken
for
which
his
companion
made
herbert
pay
and
after
a
hasty
meal
at
the
they
were
again
seated
in
a
railway
carriage
travelling
westward
this
second
was
a
wearisome
journey
which
continued
far
into
the
chill
autumn
night
towards
nine
they
alighted
at
a
station
where
their
baggage
was
transferred
to
a
fly
into
which
they
entered
and
were
driven
miles
or
more
at
length
they
reached
a
small
country
inn
had
some
supper
and
were
shown
to
their
rooms
said
his
companion
as
he
bade
him
affair
is
secret
keep
your
own
counsel
do
not
gossip
with
any
one
you
may
meet
here
lady
farrington
does
not
wish
her
name
bandied
about
so
mind
you
do
not
mention
it
to
a
herbert
slept
late
next
morning
and
when
he
went
downstairs
he
found
himself
alone
the
other
gentleman
had
gone
out
they
told
him
and
would
not
return
till
late
breakfast
what
would
he
like
he
might
like
what
he
pleased
but
all
he
could
get
was
cold
bacon
and
bread
with
thin
cider
to
drink
a
has
a
fine
appetite
and
is
nowise
particular
herbert
enjoyed
his
breakfast
as
he
did
also
his
lunch
and
his
dinner
he
felt
jolly
enough
he
asked
where
he
was
and
they
told
him
staignton
in
devonshire
was
there
anything
to
do
in
the
place
yes
he
might
fish
the
trout
stream
which
he
did
very
much
to
his
own
satisfaction
and
spent
a
thoroughly
pleasant
day
but
when
night
fell
and
his
companion
did
not
return
he
began
to
feel
the
least
bit
uneasy
he
ate
his
trout
however
and
his
bacon
and
bread
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
young
undismayed
by
fears
of
came
but
no
companion
a
third
and
a
fourth
day
and
herbert
was
still
alone
what
could
it
mean
he
felt
absolved
from
the
necessity
of
holding
his
tongue
and
he
asked
the
landlady
if
she
knew
any
one
of
the
name
of
farrington
in
the
country
round
about
he
was
resolved
to
go
to
her
ladyship
himself
they
had
never
heard
the
name
he
now
became
more
than
puzzled
he
was
filled
with
an
inexplicable
but
increasing
dread
of
coming
trouble
and
he
was
just
beginning
his
preparations
for
returning
at
once
to
deadham
when
the
absentee
suddenly
reappeared
herbert
was
young
inexperienced
and
terribly
shy
but
his
was
no
craven
spirit
and
he
had
enough
of
frankness
about
him
to
say
this
is
a
fine
lark
you
would
not
have
kept
me
waiting
here
much
longer
i
can
tell
you
i
was
just
going
to
cut
and
may
cut
and
run
as
soon
as
you
please
said
the
other
gruffly
sooner
the
what
would
lady
farrington
say
farrington
is
not
in
a
position
to
say
should
like
to
see
gone
off
in
a
never
was
here
or
near
here
i
know
that
much
for
i
have
broke
through
my
instructions
did
you
not
that
it
matters
much
and
it
is
time
you
should
know
all
lady
farrington
has
been
put
under
restraint
you
do
not
understand
locked
up
in
an
asylum
i
mean
she
is
mad
insane
and
of
all
her
ravings
the
wildest
were
those
which
led
you
to
suppose
you
were
somebody
instead
of
a
brat
picked
up
out
of
the
not
swear
and
no
one
shall
call
me
so
cried
herbert
hotly
he
looked
so
fierce
with
his
clenched
fists
broad
shoulders
and
light
active
figure
that
the
man
for
the
moment
was
cowed
know
who
you
are
or
where
you
came
from
but
not
what
you
think
you
are
nor
what
lady
farrington
has
made
you
believe
that
is
enough
for
have
her
of
a
mad
woman
she
has
exist
only
in
her
own
distraught
remains
to
be
seen
but
who
are
you
why
are
you
so
bitter
against
me
why
did
you
bring
me
here
am
sir
rupert
farrington
it
is
i
whom
this
mad
old
lady
wishes
to
wrong
she
has
been
seeking
what
she
calls
a
rightful
heir
all
these
years
only
that
she
may
dispossess
me
you
are
not
the
first
pretender
she
has
set
up
but
i
think
it
is
not
unlikely
you
will
be
the
had
he
brought
herbert
there
to
injure
him
the
thought
suddenly
flashed
across
the
young
mind
but
then
there
were
other
people
at

ostlers
keepers
police
not

off
none
of
these
would
knowingly
suffer
any
foul
play
to
be
done
defy
you
and
your
threats
said
herbert
i
am
in
a
false
position
it
was
none
of
my
seeking
but
i
prefer
to
believe
lady
farrington
rather
than
you
there
are
others
who
know
of
my
claims
and
with
their
help
i
shall
yet
put
them
forward
as
you
will
sir
rupert
snapped
his
fingers
at
him
do
you
propose
to
live
meanwhile
remember
you
can
get
nothing
from
lady
farrington
now
you
can
not
go
back
to
the
school
i
brought
you
all
this
way
on
purpose
that
you
should
not
besides
i
have
written
to
jiggs
to
put
him
on
his
would
still
help
me
if
i
asked
him
but
i
do
not
need
to
do
can
not
have
money
hoarded
that
would
be
very
unlike
a
you
must
be
nearly
cleaned
out
by
this
time
i
made
you
pay
your
own
expenses
on
purpose
and
there
will
be
the
bill
here
you
ought
to
be
nearly
penniless
you
will
have
to
remain
here
and
turn
farm
labourer
or
shall
not
do
that
you
may
depend
i
have
been
well
educated
thanks
to
lady
farrington
i
am
not
afraid
of
work
and
i
am
well
able
to
take
care
of
myself
at
any
rate
i
look
to
you
for
nothing
and
all
i
wish
now
is
to
get
away
from
you
and
this
herbert
called
for
his
bill
paid
it
with
his
last
sovereign
asked
the
way
to
the
nearest
railway
station
newton
abbot
and
started
off
on
foot
determined
to
get
back
to
london
as
soon
as
he
could
thence
he
would
find
his
way
to
triggertown
the
larkins
were
the
only
friends
left
in
the
world
and
larkins
as
lady
farrington
had
said
was
the
person
who
possessed
the
only
link
wanting
in
the
chain
of
proofs
which
was
to
establish
his
claims
at
newton
abbot
he
sold
his
watch
and
had
money
for
his
ticket
to
london
and
to
spare
parting
with
other
articles
of
his
apparel
to
supply
his
necessities
upon
the
road
he
found
himself
at
triggertown
upon
the
third
day
how
familiar
the
place
seemed
six
years
since
he
left
it
a
child
and
now
returning
as
a
man
he
found
everything
unchanged
he
passed
up
the
covered
way
across
the
drawbridge
under
the
arch
and
stood
at
the
door
of
the
casemate
expecting
next
moment
to
see
the
sergeant
and
larkins
and
the
whole
of
the
brood
but
it
was
a
stranger
who
came
to
answer
his
knock
a
small
vixenish
woman
with
a
shrewish
tongue
she
gave
him
a
very
short
answer
they
stop
here
been
gone
these
years
where
how
do
i
know
they
got
the
route
right
enough
all
i
can
tell
there
no
one
in
the
barracks
who
could
tell
him
herbert
asked
said
the
woman
abruptly
and
shut
the
door
in
his
face
the
sentry
would
not
let
him
pass
the
inner
gates
the
gate
sergeant
who
came
up
peremptory
and
consequential
was
still
more
inhospitable
whom
did
herbert
want
a
barrack
sergeant
of
the
name
of
larkins
there
was
no
such
name
in
the
garrison
write
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
war
my
man
said
the
gate
sergeant
with
gruff
condescension
to
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
as
likely
to
tell
you
as
another
but
you
must
clear
out
of
this
have
no
loiterers
about
here
my
orders
may
be
the
adjutant
or
the
come
this
way
and
i
choose
to
be
blamed
for
regiment
do
you
belong
to
asked
herbert
you
see
for
yourself
where
could
this
young
man
have
been
raised
not
to
recognise
the
uniform
of
the
own
fusiliers
it
a
good
corps
the
sergeant
was
aghast
at
the
impudence
like
every
soldier
of
the
old
school
he
had
been
brought
up
to
believe
that
his
regiment
was
not
only
a
good
one
but
the
very
best
in
the
service
i
want
no
more
truck
with
you
clear
out
or
be
put
your
name
i
want
to
see
want
to
see
him
if
you
know
his
do
though
on
business
a
tramp
like
you
have
no
business
here
at
all
much
less
with
the
colonel
or
any
other
officer
of
you
pass
me
in
there
right
wait
till
some
one
comes
herbert
coolly
seated
himself
a
little
way
down
upon
the
slope
of
the
glacis
if
the
sergeant
meant
to
dislodge
him
it
could
only
be
by
force
the
fact
was
our
hero
was
meditating
a
serious
step
the
disappointment
of
not
finding
his
old
friends
where
he
had
left
them
was
great
he
had
perhaps
overrated
the
assistance
which
larkins
could
give
him
in
substantiating
his
claims
but
he
had
looked
for
advice
from
them
as
to
the
disposal
of
his
immediate
future
how
was
he
now
unknown
and
seemingly
without
a
friend
in
the
world
to
find
employment
that
was
the
serious
question
he
was
called
upon
to
solve
and
that
without
unnecessary
delay
his
pockets
were
empty
his
clothes
such
as
he
had
not
pawned
had
reached
that
stage
of
irretrievable
seediness
which
clothes
worn
uninterruptedly
for
weeks
will
always
assume
he
might
or
might
not
be
the
heir
of
the
farringtons
what
did
it
matter
who
he
was
or
might
be
if
he
died
of
starvation
before
he
could
prove
his
case
these
wholesome
reflections
led
him
to
accept
the
only
means
of
livelihood
which
offered
just
then
he
would
enlist
why
not
he
had
been
brought
up
within
sound
of
the
drum
his
earliest
recollections
and
associations
were
connected
with
the
barrack
the
life
might
be
rough
compared
to
the
luxury
of
deadham
but
at
least
he
would
be
fed
clothed
and
housed
and
he
need
not
stand
still
the
theory
of
the
baton
which
every
knapsack
is
said
to
contain
is
not
exactly
supported
by
fact
in
the
british
army
but
times
were
not
what
they
had
been
and
he
might
now
hope
to
rise
rapidly
enough
yes
he
would
take
the
shilling
and
join
the
own
fusiliers
these
were
the
words
he
addressed
to
the
first
officer
who
issued
from
the
gates
it
happened
to
be
the
adjutant
himself
wheeler
was
the
beau
ideal
of
a
smart
young
soldier
quick
and
energetic
in
movement
with
an
eagle
eye
to
take
in
the
of
a
possible
recruit
to
enlist
do
you
hey
what
what
what
where
do
you
come
from
say
i
suppose
where
do
you
belong
to
know
of
course
your
age
you
tell
the
truth
height
we
can
see
to
that
health
are
you
sound
in
wind
and
limb
hey
what
what
what
all
this
time
he
had
been
appraising
value
had
noted
his
broad
shoulders
thin
flanks
his
inches
and
his
erect
bearing
as
keenly
as
though
he
were
a
slave
merchant
about
to
turn
a
penny
on
a
deal
the
scrutiny
was
satisfactory
the
medical
examination
confirmed
it
the
nearest
magistrate
sanctioned
the
enlistment
and
before
sundown
herbert
larkins
had
joined
the
own
and
had
sworn
to
serve
her
majesty
and
her
heirs
for
a
term
of
years
by
a
strange
coincidence
within
a
week
or
two
ernest
farrington
sir
only
son
was
gazetted
to
the
same
regiment
and
the
two
young
men
presently
found
themselves
in
the
same
squad
at
drill
chapter
a
crack
corps
the
own
fusiliers
had
the
credit
of
being
one
of
the
most
distinguished
regiments
in
the
service
of
the
queen
its
colours
were
emblazoned
with
the
victories
in
which
it
had
shared
its
mess
plate
was
rich
in
gifts
from
the
great
captains
and
men
of
mark
who
had
held
commissions
in
its
ranks
it
considered
itself
in
every
respect
a
crack
corps
and
held
its
head
high
always
on
account
of
its
thorough
efficiency
and
undeniably
its
claims
to
the
latter
could
not
be
denied
but
its
rights
to
the
former
were
sometimes
questioned
by
critics
and
people
behind
the
scenes
the
regiment
no
doubt
turned
out
smartly
upon
parade
it
always
looked
well
and
was
fairly
but
there
were
flaws
and
in
its
system
hidden
a
little
below
the
surface
which
in
the
crucial
test
of
emergency
would
probably
be
laid
bare
the
gulf
between
officers
and
men
was
a
little
too
wide
inferiors
had
no
great
confidence
in
those
above
them
the
latter
were
generally
indifferent
taking
but
little
interest
in
their
business
as
though
soldiering
was
not
their
profession
but
a
chance
employment
to
fill
up
their
hours
when
not
otherwise
engaged
a
certain
colonel
prioleau
commanded
the
regiment
at
the
time
when
herbert
larkins
enlisted
into
it
a
soldier
of
the
old
school
at
times
fussy
testy
and
but
really
a
man
he
was
without
much
strength
of
character
however
and
not
with
brains
it
was
not
strange
therefore
that
he
should
suffer
his
authority
to
slip
a
little
out
of
his
own
hands
he
was
far
from
supreme
in
the
body
of
which
he
was
the
ostensible
head
english
regiments
are
very
variously
governed
this
is
ruled
by
the
that
by
the
wife
in
another
the
general
of
the
brigade
or
district
with
his
works
his
own
wicked
will
some
are
so
to
speak
and
the
own
was
one
of
these
in
it
the
will
of
the
body
corporate
of
the
officers
banded
together
like
a
company
and
trading
under
the
name
of
was
absolute
law
by
and
for
regiment
everything
was
settled
and
decided
the
regimental
idea
was
a
species
of
impalpable
but
essence
which
no
one
could
resist
to
quote
regimental
custom
to
invoke
regimental
prestige
to
talk
of
the
credit
of
the
regiment
to
insist
upon
the
maintenance
of
de
were
so
many
irresistible
appeals
so
many
precepts
of
a
powerful
unwritten
code
universally
accepted
and
admitted
to
be
binding
upon
all
in
its
highest
form
this
devotion
might
be
productive
as
indeed
it
has
often
proved
to
be
of
extraordinary
good
but
it
was
possible
to
develop
it
in
the
wrong
direction
and
this
was
to
some
extent
the
case
with
the
own
fusiliers
it
was
generally
understood
in
the
regiment
that
its
credit
depended
less
upon
its
military
proficiency
than
upon
the
dash
it
cut
in
the
world
military
matters
in
fact
were
not
held
in
the
highest
esteem
in
the
own
nobody
cared
much
about
them
they
were
left
to
be
managed
by
anybody
anyhow
now
and
again
colonel
prioleau
raised
a
feeble
protest
but
nobody
listened
to
him
or
cared
he
was
told
that
the
regiment
wished
this
or
thought
that
and
he
immediately
succumbed
those
next
senior
to
him
his
two
majors
were
of
little
assistance
to
him
in
driving
the
coach
one
major
diggle
of
whom
more
directly
did
not
pretend
to
be
a
soldier
at
all
according
to
his
own
ideas
he
was
always
much
better
engaged
the
other
major
byfield
had
unfortunately
been
raised
in
another
regiment
and
was
so
unpopular
that
he
was
worse
than
a
cipher
the
own
knew
too
well
what
was
due
to
itself
to
allow
an
outsider
to
dictate
to
it
or
interfere
in
its
affairs
the
only
person
who
did
anything
in
the
regiment
was
the
adjutant
and
he
had
come
by
degrees
to
monopolise
the
whole
of
the
power
the
colonel
gave
in
to
him
more
and
more
till
presently
he
abdicated
his
functions
to
him
altogether
after
all
wheeler
was
a
smart
young
gentleman
not
without
military
aptitudes
he
had
no
dread
of
responsibility
and
having
a
fair
knowledge
of
the
and
routine
disposed
of
his
work
daily
in
an
airy
fashion
which
was
always
refreshing
and
which
in
the
face
of
any
serious
difficulty
would
have
been
absolutely
sublime
he
pulled
all
the
strings
decided
all
the
moot
points
gave
all
orders
drafted
all
letters
which
his
humble
slave
the
colonel
obediently
signed
it
was
he
practically
who
manœuvred
the
battalion
although
his
puppet
the
colonel
nominally
gave
the
word
of
command
it
saved
everybody
else
a
great
deal
of
trouble
the
men
perhaps
were
not
quite
as
well
cared
for
and
commanded
as
they
ought
to
have
been
the
sergeants
looking
to
the
adjutant
rather
than
to
their
officers
sometimes
exceeded
their
powers
and
carried
matters
with
rather
a
high
hand
complaints
of
tyranny
and
however
seldom
cropped
up
and
no
suspicion
ever
arose
that
the
condition
of
the
regiment
was
otherwise
than
perfectly
sound
it
was
not
difficult
to
understand
why
the
officers
as
a
body
rather
neglected
their
duties
they
were
too
fully
occupied
in
maintaining
the
credit
of
the
regiment
according
to
their
own
interpretation
of
the
phrase
this
meant
that
it
should
be
renowned
not
for
marching
and
manœuvres
for
demeanour
discipline
and
drill
but
for
its
ostentation
and
display
for
the
grand
balls
and
entertainments
it
gave
for
its
mess
perfectly
appointed
its
artistic
its
exquisite
wines
it
was
for
the
credit
of
the
regiment
that
it
should
keep
up
a
regimental
drag
a
cricket
and
lawn
tennis
club
and
give
weekly
afternoon
teas
that
during
the
season
six
or
seven
at
least
of
the
own
should
turn
out
in
scarlet
to
hunt
with
the
nearest
hounds
that
some
one
amongst
their
number
should
take
a
shooting
or
a
river
which
the
regimental
sportsmen
might
honour
in
turn
that
half
the
regiment
at
least
should
rush
up
to
town
from
friday
to
monday
every
week
and
enjoy
themselves
in
loafing
about
the
park
and
the
burlington
arcade
or
idling
away
the
hours
at
the
club
and
devoutly
wishing
they
were
back
at
their
own
regimental
mess
these
ideas
very
rapidly
developed
into
extravagant
tastes
which
had
reached
their
highest
point
about
the
time
when
herbert
larkins
became
one
of
the
own
the
regiment
had
only
returned
a
year
or
two
previously
from
a
lengthened
tour
of
foreign
service
and
after
their
long
exile
in
outer
darkness
everyone
with
any
spirit
or
capacity
for
enjoyment
had
been
resolved
to
take
his
pleasure
to
the
full
it
was
expected
of
the
officers
of
the
own
to
come
well
to
the
front
and
this
they
pretended
was
a
more
potent
inducement
to
them
to
spend
money
than
any
hankering
after
personal
gratification
so
with
but
few
exceptions
they
launched
forth
freely
enough
it
was
with
many
a
case
of
the
earthen
pots
swimming
with
the
brass
but
all
or
nearly
all
were
determined
to
do
their
duty
to
the
regiment
and
go
the
pace
or
as
crouch
the
sporting
quartermaster
styled
it
to
the
devil
hands
what
if
any
serious
financial
crisis
supervened
their
people
would
have
to
stump
up
their
fathers
probably
by
drawing
upon
a
provision
or
portion
and
always
by
impoverishing
themselves
would
pay
their
debts
but
they
would
have
had
high
old
time
and
the
imperishable
credit
of
the
own
fusiliers
would
have
been
most
brilliantly
maintained
the
leading
spirit
and
showman
of
the
regiment
at
this
particular
epoch
was
the
junior
major
diggle
was
in
his
way
a
man
of
parts
young
pushing
ambitious
passably
rich
no
one
knew
exactly
where
he
came
from
or
who
were
his
belongings
or
his
people
one
of
his
patronymics
was
decidedly
patrician
the
other
as
unmistakeably
commonplace
he
might
be
a
cousin
of
the
duke
of
devonshire
and
again
he
might
not
when
anyone
asked
him
the
question
and
it
was
one
he
liked
to
have
put
to
him
he
smiled
pleasantly
and
said
that
the
cavendishes
were
all
related
as
everybody
knew
but
he
was
not
so
well
pleased
when
people
envious
or
cynical
or
both
remarked
casually
that
diggle
was
the
name
of
the
great
grocers
in
cheapside
there
was
no
connection
on
that
side
of
course
but
the
allusion
was
far
from
agreeable
to
him
as
a
shrewd
observer
might
have
noticed
from
his
face
and
his
avowed
hostility
to
anyone
who
dared
to
make
the
remark
there
were
not
many
who
were
bold
enough
to
attack
him
however
he
could
hold
his
own
always
nature
had
endowed
him
with
a
good
presence
and
abundance
of
he
could
talk
well
had
a
good
voice
and
was
an
excellent
these
gifts
were
naturally
of
great
service
to
him
not
alone
for
purposes
of
repartee
and
they
were
also
exceedingly
useful
in
assisting
him
to
obtain
that
social
success
which
had
ever
been
one
of
the
principal
aims
of
his
life
in
his
boyhood
when
he
had
made
his
as
a
second
lieutenant
in
the
own
fusiliers
he
had
had
an
uphill
game
to
play
the
regiment
was
then
as
it
still
aspired
to
be
eminently
aristocratic
and
no
one
was
disposed
to
welcome
a
diggle
with
rapturous
effusion
there
was
nothing
against
the
lad
however
except
the
possible
obscurity
of
his
origin
on
the
contrary
there
was
much
in
his
favour
he
was
modest
and
unpretending
fully
impressed
with
the
of
he
had
joined
falling
down
readily
to
worship
the
principal
personages
who
were
its
idols
at
the
time
he
sought
to
attach
himself
to
one
or
two
of
the
most
distinguished
cadets
of
noble
houses
who
were
nobodies
at
home
but
made
a
good
deal
of
in
the
own
hero
worship
accompanied
as
it
was
by
a
willingness
to
bet
play
and
do
good
turns
to
his
superiors
he
thought
them
so
himself
met
with
its
reward
and
he
soon
found
himself
in
the
position
to
enjoy
the
daily
companionship
and
friendship
of
one
or
two
baronets
and
several
sons
it
was
long
however
before
he
advanced
himself
beyond
the
rather
undignified
status
of
a
his
friends
and
comrades
were
very
affectionate
with
the
regiment
but
they
were
not
so
fond
of
him
in
town
nor
did
they
help
him
into
society
or
get
him
invitations
to
their
homes
but
as
time
passed
and
he
gained
promotion
and
seniority
his
persistent
efforts
gradually
achieved
a
certain
success
he
now
took
a
prominent
part
in
regimental
entertainments
was
willing
to
accept
all
the
drudgery
of
managing
balls
and
parties
because
he
thus
came
more
to
the
front
at
one
rather
dull
country
station
he
struck
out
the
happy
idea
of
giving
dances
on
his
account
in
his
own
quarters
which
happened
to
be
large
and
at
his
own
expense
and
this
gained
for
him
great
popularity
in
the
neighbourhood
it
was
about
this
time
that
he
began
to
lay
much
stress
upon
the
cavendish
prefix
to
his
proper
name
he
always
called
himself
had
it
so
put
in
the
and
upon
his
cards
then
the
regiment
went
on
foreign
service
and
while
stationed
in
an
colony
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
selected
to
act
upon
the
personal
staff
of
the
governor
and
he
turned
this
appointment
to
excellent
account
he
was
soon
the
life
and
soul
of
government
house
developing
at
once
into
a
species
of
diplomatic
who
was
simply
indispensable
to
his
chief
in
this
way
he
made
many
new
and
valuable
friends
a
young
royalty
on
his
travels
who
was
charmed
with
captain
devotion
to
his
person
several
heirs
apparent
also
and
itinerant
legislators
who
took
barataria
in
their
journey
round
the
world
and
who
could
not
be
too
grateful
for
all
he
did
for
them
or
too
profuse
in
their
promises
of
civilities
whenever
he
might
be
in
england
all
this
bore
fruit
in
the
long
run
when
the
regiment
returned
he
experienced
many
disappointments
no
doubt
for
your
notable
on
his
travels
so
cordial
and
so
gushing
is
apt
to
give
you
the
cut
direct
if
you
meet
him
in
his
own
at
home
still
there
were
some
did
not
quite
forget
the
hospitable
and
obliging
and
major
at
the
invitation
of
one
went
into
norfolk
to
shoot
of
another
to
scotland
to
fish
in
the
london
season
he
found
several
houses
open
to
him
and
he
was
finally
raised
to
a
pinnacle
of
satisfaction
by
royal
commands
to
attend
a
garden
party
and
a
court
ball
in
the
own
he
was
now
a
very
great
personage
indeed
as
both
the
colonel
and
major
byfield
were
married
he
was
the
senior
member
of
the
mess
always
its
most
prominent
figure
the
chief
host
in
all
impromptu
parties
at
home
the
great
man
at
all
entertainments
abroad
he
had
now
a
following
of
his
own
a
band
of
personal
adherents
who
imitated
him
in
his
dress
and
talk
and
ways
who
deferred
to
him
flattered
him
and
admired
him
fully
as
much
as
he
had
the
shining
lights
around
which
he
had
himself
revolved
when
he
was
young
this
homage
did
not
do
him
any
great
good
it
confirmed
him
in
the
high
opinion
he
had
formed
of
himself
it
indorsed
and
justified
his
aspirations
which
were
now
by
no
means
unambitious
although
very
carefully
concealed
why
should
he
not
make
a
brilliant
marriage
there
were
plenty
of
heiresses
about
if
he
could
but
find
one
in
whom
the
charms
of
blood
and
beauty
were
united
why
should
he
not
go
in
and
win
he
was
still
comparatively
young
he
had
kept
his
figure
he
was
in
the
best
society
and
appreciated
wherever
he
went
who
should
have
a
better
chance
and
what
might
he
not
achieve
in
the
way
of
future
distinction
with
a
rich
and
wife
to
help
him
in
climbing
the
tree
these
ideas
had
been
uppermost
in
his
mind
for
some
time
past
it
was
in
obedience
to
them
that
he
had
been
at
some
pains
to
inform
himself
whether
any
likely
were
running
loose
about
triggertown
or
in
the
country
round
but
he
had
so
far
met
with
little
success
hopshire
is
a
county
owning
many
families
of
antiquity
and
repute
but
none
were
especially
renowned
for
their
wealth
diggle
would
have
gone
further
afield
and
commenced
his
chase
in
london
or
at
one
of
the
great
watering
places
but
he
wished
first
to
exhaust
the
resources
of
the
neighbourhood
the
gay
major
was
not
wrong
in
supposing
that
he
showed
off
to
the
best
advantage
upon
his
own
territory
doing
the
honours
of
his
own
mess
backed
up
and
supported
by
so
many
brilliant
comrades
and
disciples
just
when
he
began
to
despair
of
finding
any
young
lady
who
from
substantial
reasons
was
entitled
to
receive
his
addresses
he
came
across
the
farringtons
they
lived
at
the
other
end
of
the
county
there
was
a
daughter
in
the
house
a
very
charming
girl
he
thought
who
having
one
brother
only
and
no
sisters
would
assuredly
be
well
portioned
this
led
him
to
consolidate
his
acquaintance
with
sir
rupert
to
accept
many
invitations
and
pay
frequent
visits
to
farrington
hall
it
was
entirely
through
his
advice
and
intervention
that
sir
rupert
sent
young
ernest
into
the
own
the
regiment
would
probably
remain
at
triggertown
for
a
year
or
two
longer
and
this
would
break
lady
farrington
gradually
to
the
separation
from
her
beloved
son
besides
major
would
have
the
young
fellow
especially
under
his
wing
a
precious
advantage
no
doubt
as
we
shall
presently
see
chapter
vi
in
the
within
hours
of
his
arrival
in
barracks
herbert
larkins
was
bathed
cropped
clothed
numbered
and
so
to
speak
put
away
his
in
plain
english
his
civilian
clothes
invariably
so
called
whether
undeniable
garments
or
veritable
rags
had
been
exchanged
for
uniform
such
as
it
was
a
recruit
and
especially
in
the
fall
of
the
year
when
the
annual
issue
of
new
clothing
is
near
at
hand
gets
only
things
so
shell
jacket
his
regimental
trousers
and
his
ammunition
boots
were
all
of
them
palpable
misfits
he
said
as
much
to
the
corporal
of
the
pioneers
who
helped
the
in
rigging
out
recruits
large
replied
the
corporal
contemptuously
till
at
the
extension
motions
or
at
club
drill
and
wish
they
were
more
than
twice
as
my
trousers
are
too
long
and
be
longer
before
you
get
another
pair
besides
you
done
growing
yet
two
months
on
full
rations
and
be
as
tall
as
a
how
do
you
think
your
legs
look
then
showing
half
a
yard
of
sock
above
the
and
the
captain
be
safe
to
put
you
down
for
a
new
pair
of
these
boots
are
far
too
loose
i
feel
the
sides
feel
something
else
afore
long
i
can
tell
you
and
not
half
so
soft
as
leather
them
boots
why
flash
alick
nokes
wore
them
till
he
went
and
it
take
a
dozen
johnny
raws
like
you
to
make
half
a
soldier
such
as
yet
herbert
had
really
some
reason
to
be
discontented
with
his
personal
appearance
always
a
trim
and
dapper
youth
his
patroness
lady
farrington
had
loved
to
see
him
neatly
dressed
and
had
cheerfully
paid
his
bills
when
at
deadham
school
but
now
speaking
exactly
he
was
not
dressed
at
all
his
figure
was
only
concealed
with
clothes
his
jacket
was
baggy
at
the
back
the
arms
were
so
long
that
the
cuffs
came
as
far
as
his
knuckles
his
trousers
if
they
had
been
tied
in
at
the
ankle
would
have
suited
a
janissary
turk
his
it
was
before
the
days
of
smart
glengarries
not
yet
and
set
up
fell
like
a
black
over
one
forehead
and
one
ear
his
boots
were
quite
amorphous
quite
without
form
and
they
might
have
been
void
were
it
not
probable
they
encased
a
pair
of
feet
shaped
like
wedges
of
cheshire
cheese
so
deteriorating
was
the
effect
of
these
incongruous
habiliments
that
herbert
larkins
seemed
to
lose
his
erect
bearing
and
springy
step
and
as
he
reached
the
to
which
he
was
presently
marched
carrying
his
full
of
cleaning
utensils
under
one
arm
and
his
new
knapsack
under
the
other
he
hung
his
head
and
looked
utterly
ashamed
of
himself
you
is
it
said
the
sergeant
in
charge
of
the
room
who
took
him
over
from
the
corporal
of
the
pioneers
herbert
recognised
the
sergeant
with
whom
he
had
had
the
colloquy
at
the
you
got
past
the
gate
did
you
mind
you
stop
now
got
in
try
and
run
off
again
with
your
bounty
and
the
suspicious
sergeant
scented
a
probable
deserter
have
come
in
if
wanted
to
go
out
directly
afterwards
herbert
plucked
up
courage
to
say
but
the
scene
was
so
new
and
he
felt
so
forlorn
in
his
loneliness
and
his
strange
new
clothes
that
he
had
not
much
spirit
left
in
him
answer
me
with
cheek
cried
the
sergeant
very
sharply
want
none
of
your
slack
jaw
or
back
jaw
hold
your
tongue
what
got
to
do
and
do
as
look
here
he
went
on
after
a
pause
your
bed
and
your
shelf
mind
you
keep
them
clean
and
proper
you
try
to
lie
down
on
the
one
before
the
right
time
nor
put
what
authorised
on
the
other
be
for
drill
at
six
sharp
let
me
have
to
tell
you
twice
to
turn
out
and
mind
you
get
straying
away
so
that
you
answer
your
name
at
tattoo
mind
too
what
your
comrade
says
tell
you
off
to
boy
hanlon
because
much
of
an
age
mind
him
and
what
he
tells
you
and
keep
you
straight
this
to
the
room
any
of
you
seen
sergeant
not
these
hours
past
in
the
usual
place
go
canteen
some
of
the
men
laughed
and
nodded
and
the
sergeant
went
off
in
search
no
one
took
any
notice
of
herbert
as
he
sat
upon
the
edge
of
his
iron
cot
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
everybody
seemed
busy
with
his
own
affairs
but
presently
some
one
near
the
door
shouted
own
giving
the
word
of
command
as
though
an
officer
was
approaching
it
was
only
a
wizened
little
man
who
might
have
been
fifty
or
barely
five
he
a
hair
on
his
fresh
coloured
cheeks
but
they
were
much
wrinkled
as
though
he
were
prematurely
aged
boy
hanlon
was
one
of
the
oldest
soldiers
in
the
regiment
he
had
been
in
it
all
his
life
from
the
time
they
had
picked
him
up
like
a
waif
or
stray
on
the
line
of
march
between
exeter
and
plymouth
till
now
when
he
had
upwards
of
twenty
service
and
was
growing
he
had
begun
as
a
boy
in
the
band
thence
he
went
to
the
drums
he
became
a
bugler
from
which
although
barely
of
the
standard
height
he
had
been
passed
into
the
ranks
now
as
a
veteran
who
knew
his
rights
and
what
was
due
to
himself
he
gave
himself
great
airs
no
one
was
half
so
well
acquainted
as
he
was
with
professional
topics
he
could
tell
you
the
names
of
all
the
officers
past
and
present
in
the
own
he
was
a
keen
critic
upon
drill
from
his
own
point
of
view
somewhere
in
the
rear
rank
of
one
of
the
central
companies
he
could
pipeclay
belts
to
perfection
and
had
not
his
equal
with
brass
ball
heel
ball
button
stick
and
brush
but
the
chief
source
of
his
pride
were
his
confidential
relations
with
colonel
prioleau
the
present
commanding
officer
the
two
had
together
all
these
years
in
every
clime
and
knew
each
other
thoroughly
more
they
had
stood
side
by
side
at
the
battle
of
goojerat
where
the
own
had
fought
remarkably
well
and
they
were
the
only
two
survivors
of
that
glorious
day
hanlon
he
got
his
soubriquet
of
course
from
his
insignificant
size
traded
a
good
deal
on
that
battle
of
goojerat
he
was
perpetually
celebrating
the
victory
for
one
single
battle
it
had
an
extraordinary
number
of
anniversaries
whenever
was
thirsty
and
with
him
drought
was
perennial
he
turned
up
at
the
orderly
room
and
told
the
colonel
it
was
a
fine
morning
the
day
old
prioleau
would
ask
with
pretended
ignorance
although
he
knew
and
really
enjoyed
the
joke
great
day
of
course
colonel
the
day
of
it
was
that
only
three
weeks
ago
surely
sir
the
only
two
goojeraties
left
you
know
sir
and
like
to
drink
your
it
always
ended
in
the
same
way
the
transfer
of
from
the
colonel
to
boy
the
speedy
exchange
of
the
whole
sum
into
liquor
the
most
potent
description
preferred
a
free
fight
for
was
quarrelsome
in
his
cups
a
temporary
relegation
to
the
from
which
he
was
sure
to
be
immediately
released
by
the
officer
of
the
day
when
hanlon
misconducted
himself
he
always
got
off
scot
free
colonel
prioleau
would
never
punish
my
towney
hanlon
asked
directly
he
entered
the
room
they
pointed
to
where
herbert
sat
disconsolate
and
the
dapper
little
soldier
who
was
still
trim
in
figure
and
straight
as
a
dart
walked
over
to
the
lad
and
gave
him
a
friendly
pat
on
the
back
young
chap
you
must
brush
up
brush
up
and
show
yourself
a
man
to
be
comrades
you
and
i
and
it
suit
me
to
consort
with
a
chap
as
is
given
to
peek
and
pine
what
do
you
call
yourself
this
was
delicately
put
recruits
do
not
always
enlist
under
their
own
names
so
hanlon
asked
not
what
herbert
was
called
but
what
he
called
himself
and
not
a
bad
looking
chap
either
too
tall
leastwise
afraid
going
to
grow
hanlon
like
many
little
men
hated
those
whose
inches
far
exceeded
his
own
in
the
days
when
there
had
been
grenadiers
it
was
his
favourite
pastime
when
at
all
the
worse
for
liquor
to
beard
the
giants
in
their
own
he
called
them
ramrods
and
other
opprobrious
names
and
his
onslaughts
generally
ended
in
his
being
carried
bodily
to
the
under
some
stalwart
arm
now
that
the
grenadier
company
was
abolished
he
disseminated
his
dislike
and
abused
every
private
who
was
more
that
five
feet
six
in
height
tall
unless
you
stop
as
you
are
gin
do
it
or
whiskey
or
perhaps
ale
if
you
took
enough
of
it
fond
of
ale
eh
eyes
glistened
with
a
joy
as
he
mentioned
his
favourite
fluid
nothing
like
ale
under
stoppages
myself
he
went
on
meditatively
stand
treat
but
have
got
your
bounty
and
the
money
for
your
clothes
you
got
the
price
of
a
glass
about
you
herbert
admitted
readily
enough
that
he
had
the
price
of
several
he
had
lost
none
of
his
schoolboy
freehandedness
and
he
had
moreover
the
wit
to
see
that
his
new
comrade
might
if
propitiated
prove
an
uncommonly
useful
friend
hanlon
first
made
herbert
swallow
some
piping
hot
tea
which
was
brought
in
just
then
and
gave
him
the
whole
of
his
bread
own
appetite
was
indifferent
and
then
the
two
amid
the
winks
and
jeers
of
the
rest
strolled
over
to
the
canteen
the
place
was
not
over
full
nothing
stronger
than
ale
and
porter
could
be
sold
in
it
and
the
own
generally
preferred
the
triggertown
taverns
so
would
hanlon
but
he
knew
that
a
newly
enlisted
recruit
would
not
be
permitted
to
leave
barracks
they
had
a
quart
the
best
hanlon
called
for
it
and
drank
it
all
but
a
glass
a
second
quart
followed
and
a
third
and
as
the
little
veteran
became
more
and
more
steeped
in
liquor
he
grew
more
and
more
communicative
he
told
herbert
all
about
the
regiment
who
were
the
chief
personages
in
it
he
spoke
with
awe
of
the
but
of
the
colonel
as
a
familiar
friend
he
described
the
ways
of
the
officers
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
regiment
the
chances
there
were
of
promotion
for
a
smart
lad
had
any
schooling
and
knew
how
to
keep
himself
straight
you
read
good
and
write
better
still
if
you
can
only
cipher
and
do
accounts
you
have
long
to
wait
for
a
lance
stripe
get
it
for
you
aye
and
more
too
get
you
put
in
the
as
a
clerk
or
perhaps
the
pay
office
you
shall
be
a

many
years
older
who
knows
perhaps
be
afore
you
die
all
through
joe
hanlon
poor
old
joe
hanlon
from
hanlon
drunk
to
hanlon
sober
there
was
a
great
distance
the
big
promises
he
made
so
freely
in
his
cups
were
all
of
them
forgotten
next
day
yet
the
little
man
was
in
his
way
a
good
friend
to
herbert
larkins
in
the
days
arduous
and
often
wearisome
of
the
novitiate
the
old
soldier
acted
always
as
mentor
and
adviser
he
taught
herbert
all
he
knew
he
helped
him
with
his
exercises
rehearsing
the
manual
and
platoon
in
the
privacy
of
the
citadel
ditch
so
that
herbert
soon
won
especial
favour
with
the
drill
instructor
of
his
squad
he
took
a
pride
in
personal
appearance
arranged
a
for
the
misfitting
jacket
and
highlows
contracted
with
one
of
the
regimental
tailors
to
alter
the
baggy
trousers
in
his
spare
hours
make
you
the
smartest
soldier
in
the
own
said
enthusiastically
the
right
stuff
got
it
in
you
a
soldier
born
every
inch
i
ask
no
questions
i
want
to
know
who
you
are
or
where
you
comes
from
but
got
blood
in
you
you
come
of
a
stock
wager
a
gallon
of
the
best
four
ale
i
like
you
lad
free
handed
and
open
spoken
and
got
an
honest
mug
of
your
own
i
like
you
and
stick
to
you
through
thick
and
the
advantages
of
boy
counsel
and
protection
were
soon
apparent
herbert
thanks
to
coaching
but
aided
not
a
little
by
his
own
native
intelligence
and
the
excellent
education
he
had
received
proved
an
apt
scholar
in
the
military
school
he
soon
learnt
his
drill
and
was
passed
for
duty
much
more
quickly
than
was
usually
the
case
with
recruits
farrington
who
had
commenced
drill
at
the
same
time
but
who
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
taking
it
easy
and
who
was
somewhat
slow
of
apprehension
to
boot
was
still
at
company
drill
when
private
larkins
fully
accoutred
and
admirably
out
took
his
place
in
the
ranks
on
guard
mounting
parade
it
was
with
a
beating
heart
that
he
found
wheeler
the
adjutant
in
making
his
minute
and
critical
inspection
pause
just
in
front
of
him
out
said
the
adjutant
curtly
and
herbert
scarcely
knew
whether
to
expect
praise
or
blame
orderly
report
yourself
at
his
quarters
after
here
was
an
honour
indeed
to
be
selected
on
his
first
parade
as
commanding
orderly
a
post
which
apart
from
the
privileges
it
brought
of
immunity
from
and
a
sure
rest
in
bed
every
private
soldier
in
the
regiment
coveted
and
esteemed
was
a
compliment
which
herbert
and
hanlon
also
appreciated
to
the
full
what
befell
the
young
orderly
at
colonel
quarters
must
be
reserved
for
another
chapter
chapter
vii
a
french
lesson
herbert
larkins
presented
himself
with
some
trepidation
at
the
commanding
quarters
a
house
outside
but
not
far
from
the
barracks
the
hall
door
was
wide
open
but
he
did
not
go
in
the
man
whom
he
relieved
told
him
patrol
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
house
that
was
all
he
had
to
this
he
did
religiously
for
half
an
hour
or
more
and
then
he
heard
himself
called
from
within
a
clear
sweet
voice
it
was
very
musical
in
its
intonation
and
very
different
from
the
gruff
accents
to
which
he
had
most
recently
been
accustomed
again
this
time
much
more
sharply
spoken
and
with
undoubted
petulance
stupid
why
you
come
when
called
and
then
the
owner
of
the
voice
appeared
mahomet
had
come
to
the
mountain
a
beautiful
child
a
fair
girl
not
yet
in
her
teens
wearing
a
fresh
pink
and
white
frock
with
pink
ribbons
in
her
sunny
locks
and
a
pink
silk
handkerchief
tied
like
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
neck
herbert
took
it
all
in
at
a
glance
and
remembered
the
picture
for
the
rest
of
his
life
a
very
imperious
young
person
evidently
she
had
honest
kindly
eyes
but
her
small
nose
slightly
tilted
and
the
upward
curve
of
scorn
in
her
lip
indicated
a
proud
haughty
nature
and
the
wilfulness
of
one
who
though
still
a
child
had
everything
always
her
own
way
an
only
child
born
late
in
their
married
life
edith
prioleau
ruled
languid
mother
and
doting
father
with
a
despotism
against
which
they
had
neither
the
inclination
nor
power
to
protest
you
the
orderly
she
asked
almost
stamping
her
foot
yes
what
i
you
should
say
when
you
speak
to
me
do
you
know
who
am
i
am
the
whereat
herbert
drew
himself
up
and
saluted
her
formally
with
hand
to
cap
as
though
she
were
the
only
a
recruit
i
suppose
she
spoke
quite
contemptuously
never
saw
you
before
i
like
strangers
i
shall
speak
to
wheeler
about
it
how
long
have
you
been
dismissed
drill
herbert
smiled
at
her
intimate
acquaintance
with
military
details
and
the
smile
seemed
to
give
her
fresh
annoyance
a
rude
soldier
you
come
as
orderly
again
but
she
remembered
what
she
wanted
this
list
to
the
barrack
library
be
quick
please
and
bring
me
all
those
books
i
want
them
at
once
please
all
you
understand
at
once
and
all
and
when
you
come
back
bring
them
in
to
me
there
in
the
back
said
another
voice
just
then
faintly
and
querulously
are
losing
the
whole
morning
your
french
bother
cried
edith
and
retired
dragging
one
foot
after
the
other
as
though
loth
to
return
to
her
studies
herbert
executed
his
commission
promptly
enough
and
presently
returned
laden
with
books
some
but
not
all
of
those
for
which
edith
had
sent
he
carried
them
straight
into
the
back
room
am
sorry
to
say
miss
that
the
of
the
is
out
and
so
is
of
waterloo
but
i
have
brought
you
of
and
the
of
then
he
stopped
short
for
he
saw
that
the
young
lady
was
not
attending
to
him
in
the
least
her
head
was
buried
in
her
hands
and
when
she
eventually
looked
up
her
eyes
were
suffused
with
tears
dear
it
is
so
hard
i
make
head
or
tail
of
it
was
only
a
french
exercise
after
all
about
which
there
was
all
this
coil
but
edith
was
not
an
industrious
scholar
in
plain
english
she
hated
books
and
would
any
day
throw
them
aside
to
get
on
her
pony
to
scamper
across
the
hopshire
downs
or
ride
out
to
the
with
her
father
or
to
stand
by
at
band
practice
or
accompany
the
regiment
when
it
marched
out
know
a
little
french
said
herbert
diffidently
i
can
help
edith
stared
at
him
through
her
tears
a
private
soldier
know
french
more
probably
than
she
knew
herself
the
notion
filled
her
with
amazement
with
gratitude
perhaps
but
also
with
chagrin
but
when
after
a
few
close
application
he
untied
the
terrible
knot
gratitude
overpowered
all
other
sentiments
and
she
could
have
shaken
hands
with
him
almost
in
her
glee
most
extraordinary
she
cried
dancing
about
the
room
with
delight
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
the
most
wonderful
orderly
seem
very
merry
miss
said
an
officer
who
put
his
head
into
the
room
just
then
major
diggle
just
look
and
in
a
few
words
volubly
spoken
she
explained
what
had
occurred
you
know
french
do
you
said
the
major
to
herbert
in
a
supercilious
tone
impossible
to
describe
latin
and
greek
perhaps
and
hebrew
sir
not
herbert
had
drawn
himself
up
straight
and
stood
correctly
at
he
had
already
learnt
the
lesson
of
respect
due
to
an
officer
and
was
fully
conscious
of
the
great
gulf
which
separated
the
major
from
the
private
soldier
your
name
larkins
where
were
you
at
school
when
did
you
enlist
and
why
herbert
answered
all
these
questions
except
the
last
choose
to
tell
that
eh
oh
with
all
my
heart
none
of
my
business
but
now
if
miss
prioleau
does
not
want
you
that
will
do
you
can
herbert
saluted
and
walked
off
directly
the
door
was
shut
the
major
turned
to
edith
and
said
ought
not
to
be
so
familiar
with
private
soldiers
you
do
that
again
miss
shall
do
as
i
please
and
choose
to
be
called
miss
major
he
equally
hated
to
be
called
diggle
without
the
cavendish
shall
tell
the
colonel
he
said
rather
angrily
as
he
left
the
room
she
only
made
a
face
after
him
when
he
had
gone
as
though
she
did
not
care
a
bit
what
he
did
there
was
no
love
lost
between
these
two
the
child
with
intuitive
perception
disliked
the
pretentious
airs
he
thought
her
a
very
pert
and
forward
child
who
ought
to
be
snubbed
and
kept
in
her
place
there
were
one
or
two
old
feuds
between
them
too
he
had
accused
her
although
she
hotly
repudiated
the
charge
of
telling
tales
he
had
caught
her
he
declared
looking
out
of
the
windows
to
see
and
tell
her
father
what
officers
came
late
for
parade
she
on
the
other
hand
had
discovered
and
had
announced
her
discovery
openly
that
he
wore
not
a
wig
but
one
of
unwin
and
coverings
for
bald
heads
and
diggle
who
was
proud
of
his
looks
did
not
like
it
at
all
it
was
not
likely
therefore
that
any
friend
of
would
find
much
favour
with
the
major
but
even
if
she
had
been
disposed
to
champion
the
erudite
recruit
so
young
and
obscure
a
soldier
was
really
beneath
the
notice
of
the
great
cavendish
diggle
herbert
might
prove
a
thorn
in
the
side
and
give
him
many
anxious
hours
but
that
time
was
still
to
come
meanwhile
herbert
larkins
pursued
the
even
tenour
of
his
ways
taking
the
rough
with
the
smooth
but
finding
that
the
first
considerably
preponderated
what
he
lacked
most
were
congenial
companions
and
agreeable
occupation
for
his
idle
hours
herbert
found
the
time
hang
very
heavy
on
his
hands
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
spend
hours
with
joe
hanlon
in
the
canteen
nor
indeed
did
wish
him
to
do
so
hanlon
was
ambitious
for
his
young
comrade
and
he
knew
the
way
to
preferment
too
well
to
encourage
herbert
to
take
to
drink
there
was
nothing
left
by
way
of
amusement
after
all
needful
polishing
and
was
done
but
patrolling
the
triggertown
streets
and
frequenting
such
ginshops
and
as
suffered
private
soldiers
in
the
uniform
to
pass
their
doors
herbert
as
a
last
resource
turned
bookworm
he
had
attended
the
regimental
school
as
in
duty
bound
but
it
was
soon
very
clear
that
a
regimental
schoolmaster
however
well
certificated
could
not
teach
an
boy
very
much
herbert
passed
all
the
required
standards
and
was
very
quickly
dismissed
as
a
prodigy
of
learning
he
might
indeed
have
obtained
a
billet
as
an
assistant
teacher
in
the
school
but
joe
hanlon
supported
him
in
his
refusal
of
the
post
there
would
be
much
better
openings
for
him
later
on
and
in
the
regular
line
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
wait
patiently
for
his
stripe
and
this
he
was
certain
to
obtain
so
soon
as
he
had
completed
the
twelve
service
from
the
time
of
joining
which
was
the
usual
time
of
probation
in
the
own
the
books
he
read
he
got
from
the
barrack
library
a
place
well
stocked
enough
but
not
with
volumes
covering
a
wide
range
of
subjects
after
exhausting
the
list
of
good
works
of
fiction
and
travel
he
felt
himself
fortunate
at
finding
rise
and
progress
of
rationalism
in
one
day
when
herbert
was
absent
on
guard
a
volume
of
this
was
lying
upon
his
shelf
in
the
wrong
place
and
the
captain
who
was
inspecting
the
rooms
noticed
it
that
larkins
his
old
enemy
the
gate
sergeant
sergeant
pepper
spoke
young
soldier
sir
very
careless
young
fellow
sir
no
use
speaking
to
him
sir
better
have
his
name
put
on
the
gate
sir
me
see
the
book
strange
a
recruit
do
you
say
he
like
smart
send
him
over
to
my
quarters
captain
greathed
was
an
officer
of
a
somewhat
uncommon
type
thoughtful
studious
steady
he
concealed
under
a
quiet
demeanour
a
true
soldierly
spirit
and
keen
professional
ambition
he
yearned
secretly
for
military
distinction
and
only
bided
his
time
meanwhile
he
read
and
pondered
deeply
the
lessons
of
the
past
he
had
mastered
military
literature
in
all
its
branches
had
he
chosen
he
might
have
entered
the
staff
college
with
ease
and
would
certainly
have
passed
through
it
with
distinction
but
he
was
too
fond
of
his
regiment
to
care
to
leave
it
even
to
study
or
to
serve
upon
the
staff
he
took
an
interest
too
in
his
men
which
was
more
than
many
of
his
brother
officers
did
sent
for
you
larkins
he
said
to
herbert
see
what
you
are
made
of
you
are
reading
do
you
understand
it
have
you
read
any
other
books
of
the
kind
was
always
fond
of
philosophic
have
been
well
educated
then
you
are
the
man
i
suppose
who
did
miss
french
lesson
for
her
that
story
had
soon
got
about
not
everything
see
how
much
you
know
and
captain
greathed
put
a
series
of
questions
to
him
which
soon
tested
the
extent
of
his
learning
ought
to
do
well
enough
but
is
not
everything
you
look
strong
are
you
active
are
you
good
at
gymnastics
can
you
play
cricket
and
walk
and
run
well
try
you
we
will
meanwhile
keep
straight
and
steady
and
do
be
your
own
fault
if
you
get
from
that
time
forth
captain
greathed
took
especial
notice
of
herbert
spoke
to
him
frequently
an
honour
highly
prized
by
the
private
soldier
advised
him
as
to
his
reading
and
lent
him
military
books
all
this
did
not
pass
unobserved
in
the
company
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
his
comrades
rather
resented
the
undisguised
preference
for
larkins
the
body
of
the
men
in
the
own
were
not
particularly
attached
to
their
officers
and
to
be
a
favourite
with
superiors
was
not
a
certain
passport
to
popularity
with
the
rank
and
file
herbert
in
spite
of
boy
championship
found
himself
kept
at
length
rather
and
often
subjected
to
innuendoes
and
sneers
one
day
there
was
some
commotion
in
the
several
men
who
had
been
slovenly
on
parade
had
had
their
stopped
these
permits
to
be
absent
from
quarters
after
hours
are
much
appreciated
and
those
who
had
forfeited
them
were
naturally
sore
herbert
who
wished
to
attend
a
lecture
at
the
institute
had
also
in
a
pass
backed
by
the
captain
which
had
been
granted
much
to
the
disgust
of
the
other
men
a
burning
shame
said
one
and
others
followed
on
the
same
side
but
with
louder
and
coarser
expletives
young
like
you
cried
a
big
soldier
jubbock
by
name
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
cock
and
bully
of
the
company
right
have
you
to
denied
your
betters
a
sneaking
young
lickspittle
got
the
length
of
the
foot
teach
you
to
jubbock
advanced
towards
him
with
a
threatening
air
said
herbert
coolly
you
teach
me
know
your
master
take
that
and
jubbock
aimed
a
tremendous
blow
at
herbert
which
the
latter
promptly
parried
and
with
a
smart
put
the
great
fellow
flat
on
his
back
there
was
a
shout
in
the
as
jubbock
rose
furious
and
closed
with
his
opponent
then
came
a
hubbub
of
voices
sergeant

was

in

so
herbert
with
a
smarting
sense
of
injustice
found
himself
relegated
to
the
and
locked
up
for
the
night
chapter
viii
the
order
book
herbert
woke
after
a
troubled
rest
disturbed
by
the
occasional
irruption
of
comrades
brought
in
by
the
piquet
and
patrols
in
various
stages
of
intoxication
and
the
visits
of
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
the
bare
boards
had
been
his
bed
and
he
ached
in
every
limb
it
was
with
a
sense
of
relief
almost
although
he
dreaded
the
ordeal
before
him
that
he
washed
and
cleaned
himself
up
preparatory
to
taking
his
place
in
the
ranks
with
the
rest
of
with
them
under
escort
of
the
guard
he
was
presently
marched
to
the
and
then
after
waiting
for
his
turn
he
was
marched
into
the
presence
of
his
commanding
officer
to
answer
for
his
alleged
crime
he
and
jubbock
appeared
together
before
their
judge
colonel
prioleau
the
sergeant
who
was
the
only
witness
gave
his
evidence
fairly
although
not
without
a
bias
against
herbert
but
the
colonel
withheld
judgment
till
he
heard
the
defence
have
you
got
to
say
he
asked
of
both
abruptly
your
honour
began
jubbock
fighting
at
all
we
was
only
wrastling
this
young
chap
says
says
he
he
knew
a
thing
or
two
about
the
cumberland
cropper
and
i
says
i
more
about
the
hampshire
hug
and
with
that
we
had
a
and
the
sergeant
found
us
at
the
old
tendency
to
misstatement
to
call
it
by
no
stronger
name
was
very
repugnant
to
honest
herbert
beg
your
pardon
sir
he
put
in
is
not
telling
you
the
truth
we
fighting
he
struck
me
and
i
knocked
him
colonel
looked
up
a
little
curiously
accent
and
his
language
were
both
more
accurate
than
one
is
accustomed
to
find
in
a
private
soldier
did
did
you
and
would
you
do
it
again
would
sir
if
he
provoked
me
not
afraid
of
him
cried
herbert
hotly
better
try
jubbock
said
growing
also
warm
notwithstanding
the
awe
inspired
by
the
great
man
in
whose
presence
he
stood
quite
evident
you
agree
bad
blood
between
you
still
well
you
know
the
old
rule
no
captain
greathed
i
hear
a
word
young
soldiers
must
find
their
level
and
hold
their
own
besides
there
is
the
old
regimental
custom
you
must
fight
it
out
send
them
down
to
the
main
ditch
as
usual
and
let
the
orderly
sergeant
go
with
them
to
see
fair
play
no
use
talking
to
me
captain
greathed
i
shall
stick
to
the
old
rule
of
the
own
so
long
as
i
am
commanding
the
captain
greathed
thought
it
wisest
to
let
matters
take
their
course
any
further
interference
to
protect
herbert
might
have
looked
like
favouritism
and
have
done
the
young
fellow
more
harm
than
good
he
may
have
thought
too
that
herbert
could
give
a
good
account
of
his
antagonist
the
mill
was
conducted
according
to
custom
in
fashion
the
orderly
sergeant
as
before
said
and
two
hanlon
was
were
the
only
spectators
for
a
long
time
it
seemed
a
close
affair
weight
and
great
reach
of
arm
were
immensely
in
his
favour
but
herbert
had
more
science
although
fast
becoming
an
art
was
not
unknown
at
deadham
school
and
he
had
grown
into
an
accomplished
practitioner
in
it
he
was
lighter
too
and
far
more
active
than
jubbock
and
this
told
in
the
long
run
his
adversary
tried
in
vain
to
get
at
him
but
herbert
danced
around
him
like
a
cork
till
by
degrees
jubbock
lost
all
patience
and
struck
out
wildly
the
wily
herbert
promptly
seized
his
advantage
and
began
to
punish
jubbock
severely
after
this
the
victory
was
not
long
in
doubt
at
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
round
jubbock
threw
up
the
sponge
and
herbert
was
declared
officially
to
have
won
the
day
the
result
of
the
fight
noised
about
as
it
was
in
the
company
naturally
added
greatly
to
prestige
jubbock
was
a
coarse
rough
fellow
inclined
to
be
brutal
and
overbearing
and
he
had
so
long
tyrannised
over
his
comrades
that
his
defeat
was
hailed
with
much
satisfaction
old
joe
hanlon
was
wild
with
delight
he
was
never
tired
of
expatiating
upon
prowess
and
talked
so
much
about
it
taking
so
much
credit
to
himself
that
you
might
have
thought
it
was
he
who
had
won
the
fight
herbert
received
even
higher
approval
i
hear
you
held
your
own
the
captain
had
said
to
him
one
day
thought
it
was
not
unlikely
you
would
but
be
puffed
up
by
your
victory
take
heed
to
your
going
not
likely
to
love
you
the
more
because
you
have
shown
yourself
the
better
there
was
wisdom
in
this
advice
jubbock
bore
malice
as
herbert
soon
found
from
his
sulky
demeanour
and
the
way
he
scowled
when
he
dared
hanlon
too
reported
that
jubbock
had
sworn
to
be
even
with
young
larkins
yet
but
what
could
he
do
herbert
laughed
such
vague
threats
to
scorn
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
unpleasant
rumours
became
rife
in
the
it
was
clear
that
the
occupants
thereof
were
not
all
loyal
to
one
another

the
men
were
growing
furious

we
there
was
a
general
stampede
out
of
the

jubbock
only
was
left
in
it
and
hanlon
who
had
been
shaving
behind
the
door
and
was
not
visible
the
men
came
trooping
back
headed
by
the
a
stout
consequential
little
man
who
felt
that
his
position
was
only

the

carefully
conducted
amid
a
decorous
silence
all
at
once
there
was
a
loud
shout
the
money
had
been
discovered
in
one
of
the
packs
it
was
cried
the
never
have
believed
there
was
a
hubbub
of
voices
the
prominent
expressions
being
told
you
so
or
did
i
say
followed
by
a
hoarse
shout
for
vengeance
for
condign
punishment
of
the
despicable
thief
a
cried
several
men
in
a
breath
and
the
cry
was
taken
up
by
the
room
give
the
lad
fair
play
said
a
new
voice
and
joe
hanlon
stepped
from
behind
the
door
what
do
you
know
about
it
the
asked
the
evidence
as
straight
as
it
can
be
he
was
all
but
taken
in
the
act
the
money
which
is
sworn
to
is
found
in

but
who
put
it
there
of
course
who
else
it
was
jubbock
who
spoke

i

the
shot
told
jubbock
visibly
quailed

i
never
touched
the

ready
to
take
my
dying
oath
saw
you
man
i
was
there
behind
the
door
shaving
and
you
thought
you
was
all
in
the
room
i
saw
you
go
to
bed
take
the
money
out
of
your
pocket
wrap
it
in
a
rag
and
put
it
in
i
all
only
one
word
against
said
the
magisterially
else
could
it
have
got
there
you
know
hanlon
asked
of
jubbock
you
know
that
larkins
is
in
hospital
and
been
there
these
three
days
past
how
could
he
have
touched
the
pack
not
been
in
the
room
for
three
days
or
right
said
the
no
more
to
be
said
jubbock
i
would
not
be
in
your
shoes
you
must
go
to
the
no
no
the
men
were
all
furious
the
thief
the
mean
hound
settle
it

a
a
have
it
your
own
way
here
snaggs
cusack
hippisley
and
muldoon
the
four
oldest
soldiers
in
the
company
go
into
my
bunk
and
talk
it
over

to
be
done
with
they
came
back
presently
guilty
three
dozen
with
the
sling
of
his
own
rifle
our
sentence
i
approve
said
the
and
the
informal
punishment
was
forthwith
administered
in
a
way
which
would
have
gladdened
the
heart
of
the
fiercest
old
martinet
who
ever
told
the
drummer
to
lay
on
herbert
heard
all
about
it
as
soon
as
he
came
out
of
hospital
and
was
not
sorry
for
the
villain
who
had
so
nearly
led
him
into
a
terrible
scrape
had
the
case
been
proved
against
him
it
would
have
ruined
him
utterly
for
now
at
length
promotion
humble
enough
but
still
advancement
was
close
at
hand
within
a
week
or
two
the
regimental
orders
contained
a
notification
that
private
herbert
larkins
of
f
company
was
appointed
a
this
raised
him
at
once
above
the
malevolence
of
enemies
such
as
jubbock
but
it
gave
him
work
enough
for
half
a
dozen
the
the
junior
grade
of
officer
is
a
sort
of
general
utility
man
whose
duties
begin
at
daylight
and
do
not
end
at
night
he
must
be
always
clean
and
well
dressed
or
adieu
to
hope
of
further
promotion
he
must
be
at
the
beck
and
call
of
the
company
sergeants
and
ready
to
fly
for
the
he
must
be
peremptory
yet
judicious
with
the
privates
whom
although
he
was
one
himself
yesterday
he
is
called
upon
now
to
command
difficult
not
to
say
arduous
as
were
his
functions
herbert
managed
to
discharge
them
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
superiors
and
soon
became
known
in
the
regiment
as
a
smart
and
intelligent
young
man
one
evening
it
fell
to
his
lot
to
take
the
round
for
the
perusal
of
the
officers
of
the
company
ernest
farrington
was
one
of
them
and
in
due
course
herbert
came
to
his
quarters
he
knocked
and
heard
the
usual
all
right
one
moment
sir
all
i
know
about
it
went
on
young
farrington
in
continuation
evidently
of
a
previous
talk
his
interlocutor
was
major
know
what
became
of
lady
farrington
where
is
she
a
private
asylum
at
greystone
the
other
end
of
the
county
you
be
sure
it
must
have
given
sir
rupert
great
annoyance
but
now
all
happily
settled
of
course
diggle
was
just
then
making
the
running
for
miss
farrington
and
wished
to
be
quite
certain
that
there
was
no
fear
of
future
disinheritance
said
ernest
crazy
old
creature
be
heard
of
again
i
leave
the
order
book
sir
herbert
then
asked
and
they
remembered
they
were
not
alone
they
little
guessed
who
their
listener
was
and
how
much
they
had
inadvertently
revealed
to
him
he
had
long
wished
to
ascertain
the
whereabouts
of
his
kind
patroness
and
now
he
knew
what
use
he
might
make
of
the
information
did
not
occur
to
him
after
all
what
could
a
poor
soldier
do
against
such
a
powerful
enemy
as
sir
rupert
farrington
still
the
mouse
helped
the
lion
and
it
was
something
to
know
exactly
what
had
become
of
poor
lady
farrington
if
he
could
but
come
across
the
larkins
there
might
be
some
hope
of
his
himself
perhaps
of
again
putting
forward
his
claims
but
the
only
reply
he
received
from
the
war
office
to
which
he
had
written
was
that
sergeant
larkins
was
employed
as
a
abroad
and
could
not
at
the
moment
be
traced
he
must
wait
that
was
clear
but
everything
comes
to
him
who
can
wait
and
herbert
was
still
young
enough
to
be
sanguine
and
full
of
hope
chapter
ix
a
ball
in
barracks
the
first
of
september
was
a
great
day
always
at
farrington
hall
sir
rupert
preserved
very
strictly
he
was
fond
of
shooting
and
his
coverts
were
always
well
stocked
they
had
a
large
party
in
the
house
men
chiefly
good
guns
who
could
be
relied
upon
to
do
their
share
in
swelling
the
farrington
this
year
several
of
brother
officers
were
to
have
been
invited
but
major
diggle
manœuvred
so
cleverly
that
none
of
them
were
asked
but
himself
he
had
his
own
reasons
for
keeping
men
away
from
the
hall
he
was
not
afraid
of
rivals
of
course
who
among
the
own
was
there
to
compete
with
him
still
they
might
inadvertently
interfere
with
his
little
game
and
he
preferred
at
least
for
the
present
to
have
the
field
all
to
himself
major
was
much
appreciated
at
the
hall
lady
farrington
a
foolish
inconsequent
woman
who
was
entirely
wrapped
up
in
ernest
her
only
son
received
the
major
almost
with
effusion
he
had
been
oh
so
kind
to
ernest
she
knew
it
it
was
no
use
his
disclaiming
it
and
she
was
deeply
grateful
to
him
thutch
a
trial
joining
a
regiment
everything
tho
thrange
and
erney
tho
young
tho
inexperienced
he
would
have
been
mitherable
quite
mitherable
but
for
lady
farrington
was
a
large
fair
woman
so
fair
as
to
be
almost
colourless
her
manner
was
not
without
distinction
and
would
have
been
impressive
but
for
the
vapidity
of
her
remarks
and
a
trick
of
utterance
due
seemingly
to
her
having
too
many
teeth
in
her
mouth
which
robbed
her
words
of
anything
like
expression
and
sometimes
made
them
unintelligible
ernest
her
son
greatly
took
after
her
he
was
tall
but
rather
shambling
in
gait
and
still
excessively
thin
in
voice
and
manner
of
speech
he
reproduced
lady
farrington
exactly
his
mouth
also
seemed
full
of
hot
potatoes
or
too
full
of
teeth
and
as
he
had
a
trick
of
keeping
it
constantly
open
as
though
to
cool
the
potatoes
or
air
his
teeth
his
general
expression
was
vacuous
in
the
extreme
a
rather
full
lower
lip
and
a
very
receding
chin
did
not
add
to
his
personal
charms
you
gathered
at
once
from
his
face
and
air
that
he
was
weak
irresolute
easily
led
and
that
he
might
if
misled
slide
soon
into
vicious
ways
but
he
had
improved
wonderfully
since
he
had
joined
the
own
they
all
said
so
even
sir
rupert
dark
and
undemonstrative
as
he
was
generally
thawed
enough
to
say
that
he
thought
soldiering
would
make
a
man
of
ernest
if
anything
would
letitia
as
miss
farrington
was
called
and
who
in
many
respects
resembled
her
father
changed
her
tone
on
seeing
how
much
ernest
was
changed
for
the
better
her
attitude
towards
him
had
hitherto
been
one
of
patronage
mixed
with
spite
although
outwardly
she
was
very
affectionate
in
her
heart
she
bore
him
a
grudge
because
he
was
one
of
the
sex
commonly
called
superior
to
her
own
she
was
the
elder
by
three
or
four
years
she
had
far
more
brains
that
that
was
as
she
said
when
she
was
more
than
usually
venomous
seeing
that
ernest
had
next
to
none
she
was
a
farrington
as
was
evident
from
her
likeness
to
her
father
while
her
brother
was
clearly
a
burdakin
like
his
mother
why
should
an
absurd
and
monstrously
unfair
custom
constitute
him
the
heir
and
future
head
of
the
family
while
she
must
be
satisfied
with
what
her
father
might
choose
to
give
her
as
a
marriage
portion
or
as
a
settlement
for
life
she
had
always
bitterly
resented
the
salic
law
as
it
obtained
in
england
with
regard
to
the
succession
of
estates
and
titles
letitia
was
however
much
more
civil
to
ernest
now
there
may
be
many
subtle
reasons
for
such
sudden
changes
of
demeanour
major
was
perhaps
not
remotely
connected
with
he
was
bosom
friend
what
if
he
presently
developed
into
a
friend
and
admirer
of
her
own
letitia
was
not
exactly
but
she
was
certainly
not
a
beauty
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
dark
complexioned
and
thin
lipped
but
with
a
nose
too
sharp
and
cheek
bones
too
high
her
face
was
not
strikingly
attractive
to
say
the
least
of
it
and
the
fact
was
being
gradually
borne
in
upon
her
as
she
grew
on
in
years
by
the
slackness
with
which
suitors
sought
her
hand
major
was
one
of
the
first
who
showed
better
taste
why
should
not
men
admire
her
she
had
a
neat
figure
her
eyes
were
good
of
the
deep
brown
piercing
order
her
dark
hair
was
abundant
and
rich
she
was
a
good
talker
had
all
the
accomplishments
of
a
young
lady
and
a
large
share
of
that
indescribable
air
of
good
breeding
of
that
perfect
ease
in
manner
and
thorough
which
are
only
to
be
seen
in
women
of
good
station
all
of
which
diggle
felt
would
be
extremely
becoming
in
a
or
general
wife
if
the
thin
lips
and
fierce
eyes
foretold
a
vixenish
temper
when
thwarted
or
if
the
world
went
wrong
with
her
these
were
bad
points
still
in
embryo
little
likely
to
deter
so
matter
of
fact
a
wooer
as
diggle
from
prosecuting
his
suit
not
that
he
precipitated
matters
he
could
see
with
half
an
eye
that
miss
farrington
accepted
his
attentions
cheerfully
enough
but
he
was
very
doubtful
whether
her
parents
would
look
upon
him
with
equal
favour
indeed
sir
rupert
had
more
than
once
spoken
in
a
way
to
damp
hopes
the
baronet
held
his
head
high
he
evidently
knew
what
was
due
to
himself
having
passed
his
early
years
as
a
struggling
solicitor
barely
able
to
keep
the
wolf
from
his
door
he
was
now
very
eloquent
about
and
the
proper
maintenance
of
distinctions
of
class
the
heart
misgave
him
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
when
he
heard
sir
rupert
inveighing
against
the
annoyance
of
upstart
tradesmen
who
on
the
strength
of
fortunes
amassed
by
not
too
reputable
business
so
he
said
aped
the
manners
of
their
betters
and
tried
to
push
themselves
forward
into
the
front
rank
of
society
this
very
visit
to
farrington
hall
a
crusty
old
county
magnate
to
whom
diggle
had
been
formally
introduced
had
remarked
rather
pointedly
upon
the
name
diggle
i
know
the
name
to
be
sure
get
my
tea
from
devilish
good
tea
too
no
connection
major
eh
at
which
major
inwardly
shuddered
although
he
replied
promptly
enough
and
taste
our
champagne
at
triggertown
burkinshaw
far
better
than
the
best
tea
in
the
whereby
the
inconvenient
question
was
for
the
moment
satisfactorily
shelved
diggle
knew
therefore
that
much
circumspection
would
be
necessary
if
he
aspired
to
hand
all
he
could
hope
to
gain
was
the
and
and
this
by
his
assiduous
although
diplomatically
veiled
attentions
he
secured
in
due
course
meanwhile
he
sought
and
entirely
succeeded
in
making
himself
agreeable
to
all
in
the
house
he
talked
with
sir
rupert
parochial
business
and
district
visiting
with
lady
farrington
who
pretended
to
play
the
dorcas
in
the
parish
he
discussed
turnips
and
quarter
sessions
with
the
squires
and
local
magnates
who
thought
that
such
matters
comprised
the
whole
duty
of
man
last
of
all
he
played
duets
and
danced
with
miss
farrington
after
dinner
in
a
way
she
called
and
really
felt
to
be
divine
does
not
bore
you
to
dance
she
asked
him
one
evening
with
no
indeed
and
really
i
am
passionately
devoted
to
men
are
so
fine
they
stand
about
the
doors
at
a

like

at

another
day
when
diggle
was
not

with
him
incredulous
sir
rupert
asked
of
ernest
does
your
colonel
say
colonel
in
compared
to
major
cavendish
we
always
call
him
major
cavendish
he
likes
it
better
the
the
leading
man
in
the
regiment
he
does
just
as
he
pleases
nobody
like
and
ernest
went
off
into
pæans
of
praise
expatiating
upon
innumerable
good
qualities
with
all
the
eloquence
it
was
not
much
he
could
command
but
he
did
not
exaggerate
the
influence
in
the
regiment
the
ball
which
came
off
a
month
or
so
later
was
on
a
scale
of
unprecedented
splendour
mainly
because
diggle
had
resolved
that
it
should
be
so
he
had
taken
the
affair
altogether
into
his
own
hands
it
was
he
who
insisted
that
the
ices
should
come
straight
from
that
there
should
be
eggs
and
fresh
truffles
at
supper
it
was
he
who
had
conceived
the
brilliant
idea
of
placing
barrels
in
the
tea
rooms
full
of
champagne
constantly
on
tap
he
had
commissioned
the
best
decorators
in
london
to
do
up
the
ball
rooms
one
built
contiguous
to
the
a
boudoir
intended
for
the
sole
use
of
ladies
which
was
furnished
with
ivory
toilet
appliances
and
lined
with
amber
satin
throughout
another
designed
an
artificial
grotto
filled
with
blocks
of
real
ice
which
as
they
melted
fed
a
number
of
fountains
whose
waters
fell
in
showers
of
spray
a
third
entrusted
with
the
floral
decorations
grouped
great
masses
of
tropical
plants
a
wealth
of
rich
variegated
colours
in
the
corridors
before
the
fireplaces
and
in
all
the
best
points
of
view
there
were
two
rooms
for
dancing

in
raptures
as
diggle
received
her
and
having
presented
her
to
quiet
prioleau
who
was
in
duty
bound
to
do
the
honours
but
who
was
utterly
bored
and
worn
out
after
the
first
five
minutes
led
her
to
a
seat
of

on
a
sort
of
dais
at
the
top
of
the

major
cried
letitia

indeed
achieved
a
most
triumphant
success
like
a
scene
in
the
flowers
and
the
innumerable
lights

falling

exquisite

and
she
half
closed
her
eyes
as
in
an
ecstasy
of
bliss
wonder
what
it
will
all
cost
growled
sir
rupert
pretty
penny
i
shall
have
ernest
overdrawing
the
fact
being
that
although
ernest
received
a
handsome
allowance
his
account
was
perpetually
overdrawn
constant
association
with
diggle
did
not
tend
to
economical
ways
what
with
grouse
for
breakfast
and
fruits
for
lunch
what
with
great
guest
nights
and
expensive
wines
flowing
freely
his
mess
bills
were
enormous
then
there
were
his
horses
his
to
take
him
to
the
station
his
chambers
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
boot
varnish
and
his
new
hats
once
a
fortnight
and
his
fresh
every
two
or
three
hours
sir
rupert
hardly
knew
how
the
money
went
but
he
knew
that
the
six
hundred
a
year
he
allowed
his
son
which
was
more
than
he
had
enjoyed
for
years
until
he
came
into
the
title
did
not
go
half
as
far
as
it
should
and
he
grumbled
at
the
extravagance
and
ostentation
of
this
great
ball
the
baronet
was
not
in
the
best
of
humours
therefore
as
he
stood
upon
one
of
the
two
raised
platforms
which
had
been
erected
on
each
side
of
the
regimental
colours
for
the
accommodation
of
the
most
distinguished
guests
the
colours
were
uncased
and
drooped
gracefully
over
a
trophy
of
swords
and
bayonets
the
whole
being
under
the
protection
of
two
stalwart
sentries
in
full
uniform
who
stood
erect
and
impassive
like
stone
statues
perfectly
unmoved
by
the
revels
in
progress
around
it
was
a
signal
honour
to
be
permitted
to
mount
guard
in
the
and
only
the
and
the
steadiest
men
were
selected
for
the
duty
but
the
duty
was
fatiguing
and
the
sentries
were
relieved
every
hour
the
relief
being
carried
out
quietly
but
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
by
officers
carefully
selected
like
the
sentries
on
account
of
their
smartness
and
gallant
bearing
while
sir
rupert
was
standing
scowling
at
the
entertainment
for
which
without
sharing
in
the
honour
and
glory
he
would
probably
have
to
pay
the
relief
marched
in
he
looked
on
at
the
ceremony
without
interest
heard
with
indifferent
ears
the
trite
words
of
command
arms
take
post
shoulder
order
and
the
rest
when
something
in
the
aspect
of
the
corporal
in
command
attracted
his
attention
and
he
found
himself
looking
curiously
at
the
face
surely
he
knew
it
where
had
he
seen
it
before
then
with
a
sudden
start
he
remembered
the
man
was
the
living
image
of
cracked
lady
of
that
lad
whom
he
sir
rupert
had
inveigled
down
into
devonshire
and
left
there
to
starve
could
it
possibly
be
the
same
man
did
the
fellow
know
him
apparently
not
he
was
still
debating
the
point
as
the
relief
marched
away
when
all
doubts
were
set
at
rest
by
hearing
a
very
young
lady
a
child
in
fact
it
was
edith
prioleau
say
laughingly
and
with
the
accents
of
as
she
touched
the
corporal
on
the
arm
with
her
fan
bien
caporal
larkins
comment

to
which
the
corporal
replied
with
a
smile
bien
mademoiselle
et
vous
there
could
be
no
mistake
look

voice
all
were
the
same
what
a
curious
fatality
in
the
same
regiment
as
his
son
the
true
heir
and
the
false
serving
side
by
side
should
he
tell
ernest
then
sir
rupert
pondering
much
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
best
to
keep
his
own
counsel
but
resolved
to
put
if
possible
a
watch
upon
the
young
man
chapter
mutiny
in
the
ranks
there
was
great
grief
in
the
own
colonel
prioleau
was
about
to
leave
the
regiment
he
had
commanded
it
for
a
number
of
years
and
would
have
liked
to
have
gone
on
commanding
it
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
but
promotion
to
the
rank
of
general
was
fast
approaching
him
and
he
felt
that
he
must
at
least
a
part
of
his
cash
colonels
of
regiments
in
old
days
served
for
about
tenpence
the
rest
of
their
pay
barely
represented
the
interest
upon
the
capital
sum
they
had
sunk
in
purchasing
their
rank
by
exchanging
to
before
promotion
a
regimental
was
able
to
pull
a
few
thousands
out
of
the
fire
and
this
colonel
prioleau
did
there
was
great
grief
in
the
regiment
at
his
approaching
retirement
it
was
not
so
much
on
account
of
his
personal
qualities
although
these
more
particularly
his
system
had
long
gained
him
great
popularity
but
because
the
command
was
to
pass
into
the
hands
of
one
who
was
not
as
the
saying
is
a
own
major
byfield
had
exchanged
into
the
corps
some
few
years
previously
very
much
against
the
will
of
the
regiment
not
that
there
was
anything
against
him
appearances
were
indeed
in
his
favour
he
was
a
quiet
gentlemanly
little
person
with
that
slightly
apologetic
manner
and
hesitating
air
which
often
earn
a
man
appreciation
from
his
fellows
because
they
indicate
a
tacit
acknowledgment
of
his
inferiority
major
byfield
showed
himself
still
more
nervous
and
undecided
on
joining
the
own
although
as
a
field
officer
his
position
was
assured
and
entitled
him
to
considerable
deference
from
all
he
seldom
claimed
it
or
asserted
himself
more
than
he
could
help
his
brother
officers
tolerated
him
and
were
civil
to
him
when
they
saw
him
which
was
not
often
but
they
yielded
him
no
respect
and
suffered
him
to
interfere
very
little
in
the
discipline
and
management
of
the
corps
what
could
he
know
about
the
own
or
its
regimental
he
had
come
from
the
which
it
was
well
known
had
a
very
different
although
both
were
in
fact
ruled
by
the
regulations
and
should
have
been
governed
on
precisely
the
same
lines
there
is
a
good
deal
of
mystery
made
and
much
stress
laid
upon
the
in
force
in
a
regiment
no
doubt
in
many
minor
details
there
is
a
marked
difference
but
the
broad
outlines
are
or
ought
to
be
the
same
but
it
is
a
favourite
dogma
especially
with
officers
in
whom
de
is
strong
that
no
one
can
understand
this
system
unless
he
has
been
trained
in
a
regiment
and
assimilated
it
with
his
earliest
ideas
so
when
the
major
spoke
even
in
a
whisper
or
made
the
faintest
hint
of
a
suggestion
he
was
and
put
down
diggle
his
fellow
although
junior
field
officer
quietly
said
that
it
was
all
nonsense
that
byfield
misunderstood
the
situation
that
he
had
better
wait
till
he
had
longer
experience
in
the
regiment
before
he
presumed
to
put
forward
his
views
major
byfield
was
thus
satisfactorily
repressed
but
only
for
the
time
he
had
views
and
opinions
of
his
own
upon
soldiering
and
he
was
determined
when
opportunity
came
to
give
them
full
play
they
had
long
persistently
preached
up
and
paraded
before
him
the
system
in
force
in
the
own
but
he
had
for
as
long
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
system
was
a
bad
one
and
was
resolved
to
reform
it
should
he
ever
come
into
power
his
character
was
a
strange
medley
of
opposite
qualities
behind
the
nervous
diffidence
which
being
upon
the
surface
seemed
his
most
prominent
trait
was
an
amount
of
quiet
obstinacy
which
boded
ill
for
those
under
his
orders
should
he
ever
have
much
authority
in
his
hands
byfield
could
have
opened
eyes
had
she
been
permitted
to
disclose
the
secrets
of
the
byfield
the
major
was
as
as
a
woman
and
as
prone
to
mistake
the
relative
proportion
of
things
to
entirely
ignore
the
main
issues
to
neglect
or
overlook
broad
questions
and
concentrate
himself
with
much
tenacity
upon
comparatively
unimportant
details
these
peculiarities
began
to
develop
themselves
very
soon
after
he
obtained
the
command
it
became
evident
that
the
new
colonel
was
a
different
man
from
what
was
supposed
he
had
been
deemed
a
cipher
one
who
could
hardly
call
his
soul
his
own
but
he
proved
a
fussy
fidgetty
anxious
creature
who
from
nervous
apprehension
backed
up
by
no
small
amount
of
promised
to
make
life
a
burden
to
him
the
officers
as
a
body
began
to
fear
that
the
good
old
times
were
on
the
wane
the
decadence
of
the
own
must
have
fairly
commenced
when
leave
for
hunting
was
refused
and
there
were
two
commanding
parades
on
the
same
day
the
fact
was
the
colonel
had
resolved
to
reform
the
regiment
according
to
his
own
ideas
and
had
already
set
to
work
with
a
will
the
points
on
which
it
fell
short
of
perfection
were
very
clear
to
his
own
mind
a
weak
but
extremely
active
mind
he
thought
the
officers
neglected
their
business
and
knew
too
little
of
it
facts
incontrovertible
no
doubt
although
the
remedy
was
not
easy
to
discover
and
needed
stronger
treatment
than
colonel
byfield
was
in
a
position
to
apply
he
felt
dissatisfied
too
with
the
demeanour
of
the
men
in
quarters
and
on
parade
and
if
it
was
more
within
his
compass
to
bring
about
improvement
in
these
respects
his
task
was
likely
to
be
surrounded
with
the
greater
difficulty
if
his
officers
were
discontented
and
soured
but
the
colonel
could
not
see
much
beyond
the
end
of
his
nose
and
rushed
forward
blindly
to
his
fate
to
come
in
for
a
large
share
of
criticism
not
to
say
abuse
from
those
under
his
orders
is
too
commonly
the
lot
of
the
regimental
colonel
byfield
was
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
before
he
had
been
in
command
a
month
his
officers
generally
began
to
disapprove
of
his
proceedings
after
three
they
disliked
him
cordially
and
this
grew
into
positive
hatred
at
the
end
of
six
of
course
they
kept
their
opinions
very
much
to
themselves
english
officers
however
grievous
their
wrongs
whether
real
or
fancied
never
overstep
the
bounds
of
due
subordination
and
however
much
those
of
the
own
may
have
chafed
at
their
commanding
trying
ways
and
irksome
rule
they
did
no
more
than
call
him
a
to
one
another
and
utter
frequent
and
fervid
but
private
prayers
for
his
translation
to
some
other
sphere
in
this
world
or
the
next
they
bore
their
burden
bravely
enough
silently
too
and
without
protest
except
when
some
graceless
subaltern
or
more
artful
captain
wilfully
exhibited
an
utter
ignorance
of
the
very
rudiments
of
drill
by
clubbing
his
company
upon
parade
or
comported
himself
disgracefully
at
the
weekly
examinations
offences
especially
heinous
in
the
eyes
of
a
colonel
whose
greatest
was
to
make
his
officers
walking
or
living
encyclopædias
of
military
knowledge
the
schoolmaster
was
abroad
in
the
own
very
much
to
discomfort
and
dissatisfaction
excessive
timidity
an
exaggerated
fear
of
constituted
authority
were
the
secrets
of
colonel
irritating
line
of
conduct
he
was
for
ever
invoking
the
distant
deities
of
the
horse
guards
and
deprecating
their
wrath
as
for
their
local
chief
priest
the
general
officer
commanding
the
triggertown
district
whose
authority
was
much
more
tangible
and
near
at
hand
colonel
byfield
had
for
him
the
most
wholesome
and
abject
apprehension
it
was
to
appease
the
possible
fury
of
this
awful
functionary
that
he
worried
and
harassed
the
regiment
from
morning
till
night
will
the
general
say
or
will
the
general
do
were
phrases
continually
on
his
lips
he
forgot
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
general
who
was
an
ordinary
general
would
probably
say
or
do
nothing
at
all
but
this
professional
was
quoted
on
every
occasion
can
not
overlook
your
misconduct
he
would
say
to
joe
hanlon
when
brought
up
for
the
thousandth
time
for
being
drunk
general
let
if
the
general
cared
muttered
to
himself
must
punish
you
i
must
prioleau
never
did
sir
and
i
hope
sir
prioleau
is
not
here
now
and
i
choose
to
be
spoken
to
in
that
way
fourteen

and
if
you
come
here
again
try
you
for
i
will
mark
my
the
good
of
serving
on
in
the
old
corps
now
said
hanlon
very
wroth
after
he
had
done
his
drill
not
what
it
used
to
be
put
in
for
my
he
was
fully
entitled
to
it
service
all
told
five
badges
less
one
which
his
recent
misconduct
had
robbed
him
of
for
with
old
soldiers
it
is
strength
of
head
or
immunity
from
punishment
that
brings
reputation
and
hanlon
thanks
to
colonel
good
nature
had
the
credit
of
being
one
of
the
best
behaved
men
in
the
regiment
stay
to
be
humbugged
about
he
said
indignantly
to
his
comrade
herbert
take
my
pension
and
look
out
for

in

can
you
get

commissionaire
prison
warder

herbert
pricked
up
his
ears
you
think
you
could
get
the
last
i
wish
you
would
and
tell
you
why
never
heard
my
story
whereupon
herbert
told
it
all
knew
you
was
a
nob
from
the
first
i
saw
it
in
your
talk
and
in
the
cut
of
your
jib
of
greystone
you
say
right
you
are
where
go

not

and
give
you
the

double

hold

all
got
to
do
hold
on
and
do
your
duty
and
all
come
right
in
the
end
and
see
here
hanlon
looked
about
him
as
if
afraid
of
listeners
comfortable
in
the
old
corps
not
just
now
and
going
to
be
a
row
they
let
on
to
you
a
and
more
only
a
recruit
men
in
the
regiment
mean
mischief
if
they
only
get
the
chance
and
if
they
make
it
sure
as
my
can
they
do
think
or
care
all
they
want
is
a
rumpus
so
as
to
get
old
byfield
in
trouble
and
make
him
leave
and
that
be
able
to
do
join
them
not
whatever
they
say
keep
your
ears
cocked
and
nip
in
only
on
the
right
hanlon
had
taken
his
discharge
and
got
the
promise
of
a
billet
at
when
the
storm
actually
broke
in
the
own
colonel
byfield
had
been
agitated
beyond
measure
at
the
news
of
the
approaching
move
of
his
regiment
to
one
of
the
large
camps
and
in
view
of
the
scrutiny
which
there
awaited
him
his
petty
tyranny
had
passed
all
bounds
he
had
parades
morning
noon
and
night
he
exercised
the
men
at
squad
drill
goose
step
and
the
manual
and
platoon
he
marched
them
perpetually
in
battalion
up
and
down
the
barrack
yard
and
he
took
them
out
day
after
day
upon
triggertown
common
for
light
infantry
drill
all
this
albeit
torture
of
the
most
painful
description
they
could
have
tolerated
probably
without
a
murmur
had
not
the
colonel
dissatisfied
with
the
progress
made
sentenced
the
regiment
to
be
deprived
of
all
leave
in
all
ranks
this
was
the
point
at
which
the
worm
turned
one
fine
morning
long
after
the
bugle
had
sounded
followed
by
the
officers
and
the
not
a
man
made
his
appearance
upon
parade
colonel
byfield
and
the
officers
had
the
whole
square
to
themselves
the
rest
of
the
regiment
with
the
exception
of
a
number
of
men
belonging
to
one
company
f
formed
up
in
the
ditch
and
while
the
commanding
officer
was
whistling
at
vacancy
marched
off
in
excellent
order
to
a
distant
part
of
the
glacis
where
they
piled
arms
and
refused
to
return
it
would
be
tedious
and
it
indeed
forms
no
part
of
this
history
to
narrate
except
in
the
briefest
terms
the
progress
of
this
very
serious
military
the
men
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
went
to
the
wall
the
ringleaders
were
hunted
out
tried
and
severely
punished
and
the
whole
regiment
was
ordered
to
proceed
on
foreign
service
forthwith
the
causes
which
had
led
to
the
disturbance
were
closely
investigated
and
as
a
natural
consequence
colonel
byfield
was
placed
upon
it
was
for
a
long
time
doubtful
whether
diggle
who
was
the
next
senior
should
be
allowed
to
succeed
to
the
command
but
he
brought
all
the
interest
he
could
to
bear
and
he
eventually
won
the
day
as
colonel
diggle
commanding
a
corps
really
distinguished
although
temporarily
under
a
cloud
he
found
sir
rupert
farrington
not
indisposed
to
accept
his
proposals
for
letitia
and
the
marriage
came
off
just
before
the
regiment
embarked
for
gibraltar
it
was
at
farrington
hall
that
the
conversation
turning
as
it
had
done
more
than
once
before
upon
the
recent
mutiny
brought
our
hero
herbert
larkins
prominently
to
the
front
movement
was
not
general
certainly
not
diggle
had
said
of
the
companies
f
in
fact
did
not
take
any
share
in
ernest
deserve
the
credit
of
that
exactly
it
was
due
rather
to
an
astute
young
corporal
who
quietly
locked
the
doors
of
the
rooms
they
get
out
to
he
was
promoted
of
course
he
is
now
a
sergeant
and
is
sure
to
get
on
oh
yes
young
larkins
is
sure
to
get
was
young
larkins
was
it
you
know
him
think
i
do
i
will
tell
you
about
it
one
of
these
diggle
as
one
of
the
farrington
family
would
soon
have
a
right
to
know
chapter
xi
some
old
friends
meet
for
some
time
after
their
arrival
on
the
rock
the
officers
of
the
own
called
it
a
detestable
hole
they
were
sore
at
their
expatriation
and
the
manner
of
it
they
regretted
the
joys
they
had
left
behind
and
could
see
no
good
thing
in
the
much
vaunted
station
where
they
were
now
relegated
for
their
sins
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
in
the
place
the
climate
was
intolerable
and
there
was
nothing
to
eat
they
had
arrived
towards
the
end
of
the
summer
and
the
season
never
cool
had
been
unusually
sultry
they
came
in
too
for
the
tail
end
of
a
long
visitation
of
the
the
much
dreaded
east
wind
which
caps
the
rock
with
a
perpetual
cloud
and
makes
life
miserable
to
all
and
the
welcome
change
when
it
came
at
length
was
heralded
by
a
tremendous
thunderstorm
and
drenching
rains
the
own
were
still
under
canvas
at
the
north
front
waiting
till
the
outgoing
regiment
vacated
its
quarters
at
windmill
hill
and
their
encampment
was
nearly
swept
away
by
the
storm
officers
lost
baggage
the
men
their
kits
and
the
whole
regiment
united
in
deep
denunciations
of
the
inhospitable
rock
nor
did
gibraltar
seem
to
improve
upon
a
closer
acquaintance
its
joys
and
amusements
what
were
they
after
london
and
the
shires
racing
the
idea
was
too
preposterous
tinpot
nags
without
pace
or
breeding
cantering
round
a
graveyard
and
finishing
in
a
trot
what
sort
of
sport
was
that
to
offer
the
own
which
had
always
had
its
own
regimental
drag
to
witness
the
great
events
at
home
and
which
kept
open
house
in
its
luncheon
tent
at
ascot
and
goodwood
and
upon
epsom
downs
the
hunting
too
heaven
save
the
mark
to
talk
of
hunting
with
the
sweepings
of
a
few
kennels
dignified
with
the
name
of
a
pack
when
the
huntsman
was
a
local
genius
and
foxes
were
said
to
be
so
scarce
or
so
little
enterprising
that
it
was
often
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
a
red
herring
what
was
such
hunting
to
men
who
had
been
constantly
out
so
they
said
with
the
heythorp
the
bramham
moor
the
pytchley
and
quorn
these
were
the
earliest
impressions
of
gibraltar
prevailing
among
the
officers
of
the
own
but
our
friends
eventually
changed
their
tone
by
their
first
contemptuous
abstention
they
found
in
the
first
place
that
they
lost
all
the
fun
that
was
going
and
next
that
although
the
sport
was
they
could
not
excel
in
it
even
when
they
tried
one
or
two
of
the
own
who
were
said
to
be
in
all
the
secrets
of
the
dawson
and
john
scott
stables
went
in
for
some
of
the
plates
and
cups
at
the
autumn
meeting
and
signally
failed
in
everything
later
on
when
the
hunting
season
really
began
and
they
turned
out
in
a
body
in
red
coats
and
the
most
undeniable
tops
to
cut
everybody
down
they
were
chagrined
to
find
that
it
was
much
more
difficult
to
follow
than
they
supposed
red
coats
and
mahogany
tops
were
nowhere
at
the
end
of
the
first
burst
one
or
two
men
were
completely
thrown
out
a
few
tried
the
breakneck
country
between
only
to
crane
at
length
and
turn
back
from
the
precipices
and
steep
inclines
after
that
first
day
the
own
spoke
more
respectfully
of
the
calpe
hunt
by
and
bye
they
became
less
critical
in
other
respects
and
at
length
when
they
had
been
some
six
months
on
the
rock
entered
as
fully
into
its
amusements
and
enjoyed
them
as
thoroughly
as
the
oldest
stagers
in
the
place
there
was
one
person
however
connected
with
the
own
who
highly
appreciated
gibraltar
from
the
first
found
the
station
extremely
to
her
taste
a
bride
still
in
the
of
her
married
life
full
of
satisfaction
at
the
importance
of
her
position
as
the
commanding
wife
with
the
attention
she
thereby
received
from
all
the
own
letitia
found
soldiering
particularly
at
gibraltar
everything
that
could
be
desired
but
what
she
enjoyed
most
of
all
was
the
chance
she
now
had
of
bullying
the
brother
who
hitherto
had
had
it
all
his
own
way
at
home
ernest
might
be
the
most
worthy
at
farrington
hall
but
in
the
own
he
was
under
colonel
command
and
colonel
diggle
was
now
unquestionably
under
that
of
his
wife
how
the
exquisite
and
diggle
had
succumbed
was
a
mystery
which
will
probably
remain
unexplained
till
the
curtain
lectures
of
the
diggle
couple
are
given
to
the
world
then
it
will
no
doubt
transpire
that
in
the
exercise
of
those
inquisitorial
functions
which
every
wife
naturally
arrogates
to
herself
letitia
had
come
across
certain
damaging
facts
connected
with
the
antecedents
which
put
him
completely
under
his
thumb
that
diggle
would
come
ere
long
to
command
the
regiment
was
already
plainly
apparent
to
all
and
the
fact
was
not
hailed
with
particular
joy
in
the
corps
petticoat
government
in
a
regiment
is
not
the
most
successful
with
nor
is
it
the
most
palatable
to
those
most
closely
concerned
temper
was
a
little
too
imperious
to
be
pleasant
she
made
nipping
remarks
and
snubbed
and
put
people
down
in
a
way
they
hated
but
were
powerless
to
resent
how
can
you
say
so
major
greathed
you
are
wrong
wrong
she
married
lord
second
son
but
then
you
be
expected
to
know
or
not
what
i
have
been
accustomed
to
moxon
in
my
house
the
housekeeper
looked
to
these
things
but
then
of
course
you
which
might
be
taken
to
imply
that
moxon
had
been
brought
up
very
differently
and
could
not
be
expected
to
know
what
was
what
or
she
lectured
the
youngsters
when
they
came
within
her
reach
which
was
only
when
they
wanted
leave
knowing
that
without
her
good
word
they
could
not
expect
an
hour
hear
you
are
getting
sadly
in
debt
mauleverer
i
shall
write
to
sir
you
were
not
at
church
parade
last
sunday
smythe
the
colonel
was
quite
get
entangled
by
any
of
these
scorpions
curzon
you
see
i
know
all
about
it
carmen
molinaro
would
never
do
for
all
of
which
irritated
and
exasperated
the
officers
of
the
own
very
considerably
the
man
who
most
cordially
hated
her
however
was
the
adjutant
wheeler
he
was
chafed
perpetually
by
her
interference
nothing
was
sacred
to
her
she
rushed
into
professional
matters
with
all
the
effrontery
of
the
fool
so
long
as
she
contented
herself
with
favouring
her
pets
among
the
wives
wheeler
did
not
care
it
was
when
she
presumed
to
advise
as
to
the
orderly
room
work
the
correspondence
promotions
and
daily
routine
that
he
not
unnaturally
turned
rusty
whether
or
not
she
read
the
letters
he
scarcely
cared
but
he
did
resent
having
to
prepare
important
despatches
from
her
notes
or
send
out
letters
which
she
had
obviously
drafted
with
her
own
hand
nor
could
he
after
so
many
years
of
nearly
absolute
authority
readily
or
cheerfully
resign
his
power
in
the
regiment
hitherto
advancement
for
the
officers
had
depended
mainly
upon
his
good
word
now
it
was
becoming
evident
that
their
promotion
would
depend
in
future
upon
that
of
the
wife
in
one
particular
case
which
nearly
affected
a
friend
of
ours
they
had
fought
a
sharp
battle
the
adjutant
was
obstinate
but
the
lady
was
more
so
and
in
the
end
the
latter
won
the
day
it
was
entirely
through
good
offices
that
herbert
larkins
became
a
long
before
the
ordinary
time
she
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
young
man
not
you
may
be
sure
because
of
his
presumed
connection
with
the
family
for
of
that
she
had
not
the
slightest
inkling
but
because
it
had
lain
within
his
power
to
do
her
important
service
and
because
he
was
a
smart
fellow
to
boot
letitia
like
many
other
women
had
a
keen
eye
for
manly
beauty
but
she
had
really
reason
to
be
grateful
to
herbert
one
day
when
he
was
on
guard
upon
the
upper
road
followed
by
her
groom
passed
on
their
way
towards
the
town
something
startled
horse
and
although
an
excellent
rider
she
found
he
was
more
than
she
could
manage
after
passaging
like
a
crab
along
the
road
for
some
hundred
yards
he
took
to
plunging
and
rearing
in
a
way
to
dislodge
the
most
accomplished
from
her
seat
the
groom
had
ridden
up
alongside
but
he
was
able
to
render
little
assistance
and
his
best
efforts
only
made
horse
worse
had
not
herbert
promptly
supervened
diggle
would
undoubtedly
have
been
thrown
and
probably
badly
hurt
but
with
firm
hand
on
the
rein
he
soon
mastered
the
horse
then
gradually
pacified
him
sure
sergeant
extremely
obliged
to
you
said
cavendish
directly
she
recovered
her
breath
is
your
name
i
must
speak
of
you
specially
to
the
colonel
colonel
diggle
you
know
me
i
presume
and
i
see
you
belong
to
larkins
madam
f
company
said
our
hero
briefly
as
he
saluted
you
again
so
and
with
that
the
wife
rode
off
she
did
speak
of
him
and
his
conduct
in
the
most
glowing
terms
must
do
something
for
him
make
him
a
present
or
better
still
you
shall
a
watch
or
a
or
no
something
in
the
regiment
i
mean
promote
very
young
barely
a
year
a
sergeant
i
see
my
way
i
are
those
vacant
colours
in
g
company
she
said
displaying
a
curiously
intimate
acquaintance
with
regimental
news
impossible
not
when
i
ask
would
be
grossly
unfair
promotions
must
not
go
by
does
she
replied
as
though
he
might
expect
no
such
reward
unless
he
were
more
obliging
it
was
just
possible
that
by
this
time
diggle
could
have
deprived
himself
of
the
pleasure
without
any
acute
pang
would
wheeler
say
where
it
is
you
think
far
more
of
displeasing
wheeler
than
of
pleasing
me
i
feel
hurt
conrad
not
what
i
have
a
right
to
expect
considering
when
she
got
on
this
tack
the
colonel
threw
up
the
sponge
he
gave
in
about
the
promotion
although
the
adjutant
thereby
making
letitia
his
enemy
for
life
tried
hard
to
keep
him
up
to
the
mark
the
whole
thing
would
have
been
a
job
of
the
worst
kind
had
herbert
been
less
worthy
but
he
had
really
developed
into
an
excellent
soldier
smart
personable
and
thoroughly
well
up
in
his
work
he
had
his
at
his
ends
and
could
handle
a
squad
as
well
as
any
man
in
the
corps
he
had
learnt
by
heart
all
the
details
of
interior
economy
and
was
fully
competent
to
take
the
charge
and
payment
of
a
company
or
to
do
credit
to
his
regiment
in
any
position
in
which
he
might
be
placed
all
this
wheeler
was
forced
to
admit
and
although
he
cherished
a
grudge
against
herbert
on
account
of
what
had
passed
he
so
loved
a
good
soldier
that
he
could
not
bear
malice
long
larkins
was
indeed
fast
becoming
a
very
prominent
person
in
the
corps
some
backbiting
and
no
little
jealousy
existed
no
doubt
but
he
was
the
sort
of
man
to
soon
outgrow
and
outlive
such
feelings
there
was
much
in
his
manner
and
address
to
make
him
generally
popular
his
bright
face
his
cheerful
voice
his
manly
straightforward
ways
commended
him
of
themselves
but
he
had
other
claims
to
the
suffrages
of
his
fellows
his
old
skill
in
games
had
not
deserted
him
and
soldiers
are
very
like
schoolboys
in
their
admiration
and
respect
for
personal
prowess
the
own
eleven
thanks
to
batting
and
bowling
won
every
match
always
at
the
north
front
his
brother
sergeants
felt
lucky
if
they
could
secure
him
for
a
hand
of
fives
in
all
other
gymnastic
exercises
he
came
equally
well
to
the
front
at
the
garrison
athletic
sports
which
presently
came
off
as
they
always
do
upon
the
racecourse
at
the
north
front
he
carried
everything
before
him
to
the
intense
gratification
of
his
comrades
in
the
corps
the
name
of
sergeant
larkins
was
indeed
on
every
lip
that
day
all
the
world
of
gibraltar
was
present
his
excellency
the
governor
came
in
state
so
did
the
general
second
in
command
and
officers
of
all
grades
with
their
wives
crowds
of
soldiers
of
all
the
regiments
in
garrison
were
there
and
all
cheered
herbert
to
the
echo
as
he
carried
off
the
in
magnificent
style
as
for
the
own
a
lot
of
them
frantic
with
delight
got
him
on
their
shoulders
and
were
carrying
him
about
in
triumph
when
some
one
came
up
and
with
a
hurried
nervous
manner
said
larkins
sergeant
larkins
wants
him
said
a
dozen
voices
thinking
perhaps
the
governor
had
asked
him
to
dinner
or
the
queen
had
sent
to
make
him
a
general
on
the
spot
old
friend
the
oldest
got
i
think
say
when
he
sees
me
and
hears
my
his
enthusiastic
supporters
dropped
herbert
who
came
forward
to
speak
to
the
inquirer
himself
himself
by
all
holy
hercules
albert
you
remember
me
cried
the
man
as
he
seized
both
hands
shaking
them
furiously
and
seeming
to
wish
to
hug
him
in
his
arms
it
was
the
old
sergeant
larkins
his
stepfather
for
whom
he
had
so
long
searched
in
vain
heard
them
calling
out
the
name
and
it
sounded
so
queer
that
i
thought
have
a
look
at
you
how
grown
but
tell
me
all
about
yourself
quick
lad
i
want
to
hear
and
the
mother
she
all
right
and
well
i
hope
herbert
asked
as
soon
as
he
could
put
in
a
word
go
to
her
at
once
how
comes
it
never
seen
you
before
landed
from
malta
on
transfer
last
week
myself
the
missus
and
three
of
the
bairns
how
it
was
but
come
along
come
to
the
mother
at
once
be
crazy
with
delight
when
she
sees
you
and
so
will
all
the
chapter
xii
revelations
the
larkins
family
had
taken
up
their
residence
in
a
small
cottage
on
the
road
to
the
moorish
castle
larkins
was
now
principal
and
as
such
was
entitled
to
fairly
good
quarters
he
had
aged
considerably
since
our
first
acquaintance
with
him
his
hair
was
grizzled
his
gait
was
stiff
as
though
his
were
affected
by
innumerable
barrack
inspections
and
his
eyes
were
weak
from
constant
search
for
or
other
barrack
damages
or
the
continuous
appraisement
of
fair
wear
and
tear
larkins
had
also
changed
appreciably
she
was
still
buxom
however
and
her
voice
had
lost
none
of
its
shrill
power
when
she
was
aroused
this
was
more
seldom
than
of
yore
her
children
were
no
longer
the
trial
they
had
once
been
the
two
eldest
boys
were
out
in
the
world
sennacherib
was
in
the
band
of
a
regiment
at
malta
and
rechab
was
at
the
same
place
on
board
a
two
younger
ones
ascanius
and
leonora
were
still
at
home
and
so
was
jemima
ann
familiarly
called
mimie
now
a
blooming
maiden
of
nineteen
with
a
soft
voice
a
sweet
face
and
eyes
bright
enough
to
give
the
to
half
the
young
fellows
of
the
place
the
old
sergeant
preceded
herbert
into
the
cottage
to
prepare
his
wife
for
a
surprise
one
i
know
jonadab
some
one
not
seen
these
years
a
in
the
own
what
are
you
driving
at
i
know
no
for
the
matter
of
that
none
of
the
own
herbert
heard
her
say
as
she
came
to
the
door
the
moment
she
set
eyes
upon
her
visitor
she
started
and
shook
all
over
she
seemed
dazed
and
could
frame
no
word
of
speech
then
all
at
once
she
gave
way
and
taking
hands
in
hers
drew
him
towards
her
kissing
him
again
and
again
while
tears
of
joy
ran
down
her
cheeks
hercules
boy
my
boy
my
own
sweet
boy
this
is
a
sight
for
sore
eyes
where
have
you
dropped
from
and
in
this
dress
come
in
boy
come
in
and
tell
us
all
your
and
herbert
was
led
into
the
house
mimie
came
shyly
forward
when
she
was
called
to
add
her
welcome
to
the
brother
she
had
almost
forgotten
but
she
offered
him
her
cheek
quite
naturally
and
received
a
salute
which
nevertheless
sent
the
warm
blood
tingling
through
her
veins
are
a
sister
to
be
proud
of
said
herbert
a
beauty
you
have
grown
interrupted
larkins
you
grown
out
of
all
memory
almost
except
to
those
who
love
you
but
now
sit
down
and
know
all
about
it
what
brought
to
take
the
shilling
and
you
never
let
on
not
one
word
you
might
have
written
to
us
hercules
we
jonadab
and
me
have
had
you
always
in
our
thoughts
thinking
you
were
getting
to
be
a
fine
gentleman
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
likes
of
if
i
could
ever
forget
my
larkins
made
a
gesture
which
might
have
meant
a
strong
negative
to
the
expression
did
you
leave
school
why
did
you
enlist
you
never
wrote
to
years
ago
i
was
turned
adrift
in
the
world
that
was
why
i
wrote
over
and
over
again
to
the
horse
guards
but
could
not
hear
where
you
lady
farrington
did
she
change
her
mind
or
what
went
mad
so
they
said
and
they
locked
her
up
in
an
shouted
the
sergeant
i
always
tell
you
so
mad
she
were
madder
than
mike
horniblow
who
shot
the
maltee
and
as
mad
as
our
old
colonel
on
an
inspection
was
she
locked
up
who
did
it
know
all
that
said
larkins
herbert
recounted
fully
all
that
had
occurred
his
leaving
deadham
school
the
visit
to
the
west
country
sir
rupert
what
the
poor
soul
was
after
searching
for
a
grandson
to
succeed
to
the
title
and
estates
cried
the
sergeant
you
were
the
last
that
she
found
well
an
ill
wind
you
know
leastways
you
got
the
schooling
even
if
you
are
none
of
her
kith
or
suppose
i
am
not
really
herbert
asked
looking
very
hard
at
larkins
who
met
the
glance
without
lowering
her
eyes
there
was
something
in
her
expression
which
herbert
immediately
understood
there
must
be
an
explanation
between
them
but
it
could
not
take
place
then
and
there
should
you
be
asked
the
sergeant
i
take
you
over
with
the
mother
when
i
married
her
at
york
the
widow
conlan
she
was
then
and
you
her
only
is
my
name
then
rights
yes
but
took
that
of
larkins
now
and
you
are
a
credit
to
it
so
you
may
take
it
for
what
worth
and
keep
it
till
you
can
find
a
was
there
ever
a
chance
of
that
was
he
really
a
farrington
after
all
and
might
he
yet
prove
his
claims
of
this
no
one
could
give
him
a
clue
but
larkins
and
he
gathered
from
her
manner
that
the
subject
was
one
which
she
would
only
discuss
when
they
were
alone
he
had
no
chance
that
time
of
speaking
to
her
on
this
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
the
interchange
of
personal
news
as
is
the
case
when
friends
and
relatives
meet
after
a
long
separation
and
there
is
so
much
on
both
sides
to
tell
and
hear
but
herbert
went
to
the
cottage
next
day
the
sergeant
fortunately
was
at
the
mimie
was
out
of
the
way
and
larkins
had
the
house
all
to
herself
want
to
know
all
you
can
tell
me
mother
is
it
not
natural
to
whom
else
should
i
come
for
you
my
mother
are
you
not
mother
could
feel
more
warmly
for
her
child
than
i
do
for
you
but
tell
me
plainly
i
am
really
your
son
larkins
was
silent
is
cruel
to
keep
me
in
this
suspense
mother
for
you
have
been
one
to
me
always
i
implore
you
to
tell
me
the
whole
will
hercules
or
herbert
as
you
ought
by
rights
to
be
called
it
is
a
hard
matter
to
tell
you
all
the
tale
for
there
is
shame
and
sorrow
in
it
enough
and
that
for
both
you
and
me
must
begin
at
the
beginning
years
years
ago
when
i
was
a
bit
of
a
girl
in
my
house
i
and
my
twin
sister
annie
whom
i
loved
dearly
as
the
apple
of
my
eye
father
lived
at
he
was
a
small
tradesman
but
well
enough
to
do
mother
died
when
we
were
quite
chicks
and
we
grew
up
to
have
things
much
our
own
way
annie
was
a
real
beauty
and
had
dozens
of
lads
after
her
always
but
she
never
fancied
none
of
them
at
last
luck
sent
a
recruiting
party
of
the
lancers
to
newark
one
of
them
was
a
young
corporal
as
proper
a
chap
as
ever
took
the
shilling
fair
spoken
well
educated
and
superior
to
the
common
run
he
soon
got
courting
our
annie
and
he
was
the
first
she
favoured
father
did
not
like
it
not
a
bit
he
hated
soldiers
and
was
very
rough
about
corporal
smith
annie
and
he
had
high
words
over
it
and
one
day
she
was
not
to
be
found
recruiters
had
left
the
town
too
tell
you
what
grief
there
was
at
home
father
was
like
a
madman
and
i
was
little
better
he
tried
hard
to
get
her
back
he
went
miles
to
the
other
end
of
england
after
the
regiment
but
he
never
caught
them
up
he
was
too
late
the
regiment
had
been
ordered
off
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
through
the
rector
father
wrote
to
the
war
office
inquiring
after
corporal
smith
and
his
wife
the
answer
came
months
later
to
say
that
the
corporal
was
alive
and
well
but
that
he
had
no
wife
at
least
no
one
according
to
the
regimental
books
never
held
up
his
head
after
that
and
within
the
year
he
died
i
was
nearly
too
but
i
was
young
and
i
bore
up
better
as
i
was
all
alone
in
the
world
and
had
the
shop
on
my
hands
i
took
a
husband
who
offered
just
then
michael
conlan
a
clerk
in
a
at
newark
he
was
a
kindly
soul
not
over
strong
but
he
helped
me
in
the
business
and
we
managed
to
get
along
night
annie
returned
not
alone
she
had
a
child
with
her
her
own
a
few
months
old
only
and
the
two
came
seeking
shelter
and
rest
it
was
as
i
thought
at
first
the
old
story
betrayed
neglected
you
took
her
in
herbert
asked
eagerly
course
neither
michael
nor
myself
asked
any
questions
our
duty
was
plain
and
it
was
one
of
love
besides
for
me
all
i
know
is
what
annie
herself
told
me
and
that
was
not
much
the
corporal
it
seems
belonged
really
to
a
higher
station
in
life
he
had
quarrelled
with
his
friends
and
left
his
home
and
wanted
never
to
see
or
hear
of
them
again
but
when
child
was
born
had
married
her
would
not
acknowledge
it
although
her
silence
told
only
against
her
own
sweet
name
she
wore
a
ring
but
so
may
any
one
and
as
to
all
other
proofs
she
obstinately
refused
to
speak
i
pointed
out
the
hardship
to
her
boy
she
admitted
that
but
said
she
had
promised
and
could
not
break
her
word
so
i
did
not
worry
her
but
left
her
to
speak
in
her
own
good
time
that
time
never
came
before
annie
had
been
back
a
week
i
saw
she
was
not
long
for
this
world
she
pined
and
pined
she
looked
eagerly
for
news
from
abroad
but
none
came
from
where
she
sought
it
and
the
disappointment
helped
the
disease
in
bringing
on
the
end
her
i
swore
to
be
a
mother
to
her
boy
me
said
herbert
no
longer
in
doubt
and
as
she
nodded
assent
he
took
her
hard
hand
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
nobly
you
have
fulfilled
your
did
my
best
herbert
but
i
have
more
to
tell
you
your
mother
just
before
she
died
gave
me
a
letter
it
was
from
your
father
to
his
friends
and
was
only
to
be
sent
to
them
at
death
or
if
she
was
in
dire
distress
the
letter
was
addressed
to
lady
farrington
of
farrington
hall
it
was
not
sealed
and
i
thought
i
might
read
what
was
inside
there
were
only
a
few
words
herbert
to
his
mother
be
kinder
to
my
i
added
a
few
of
your
bright
curls
herbert
and
sent
the
letter
on
at
once
but
i
gave
no
clue
as
to
where
it
had
come
from
i
wanted
no
answer
i
was
resolved
to
take
no
help
from
any
one
in
doing
my
duty
by
you
i
hated
the
whole
of
the
farringtons
i
so
hated
the
name
of
herbert
even
that
we
called
you
hercules
albert
instead
on
i
lost
michael
my
first
husband
and
i
could
not
bear
to
remain
in
newark
alone
i
sold
up
the
shop
and
my
belongings
and
moved
to
york
it
was
there
as
conlan
a
widow
with
one
boy
you
herbert
i
met
the
sergeant
things
were
not
prospering
with
me
i
married
him
gladly
and
he
has
been
a
thorough
good
man
to
heart
was
too
full
for
him
to
speak
for
some
time
anger
disappointment
anguish
all
three
feelings
possessed
him
he
was
angry
with
his
father
sore
at
heart
for
his
sorrow
disappointed
that
there
was
no
more
to
tell
him
you
think
there
was
a
marriage
mother
do
i
always
all
turns
upon
that
i
may
have
farrington
blood
in
me
but
whether
or
no
would
matter
little
if
i
was
not
entitled
to
bear
the
must
make
up
your
mind
to
your
disappointment
herbert
what
clue
can
we
get
to
the
marriage
after
all
these
years
everybody
who
could
speak
to
it
is
probably
father
perhaps
he
is
still
he
not
have
sought
us
out
before
this
if
he
had
been
but
he
has
never
made
a
sign
nothing
but
a
miracle
could
do
you
any
good
my
boy
better
be
contented
as
you
are
and
why
should
you
be
cast
down
you
are
young
and
strong
you
have
been
educated
like
a
gentleman
have
made
a
start
and
have
everything
before
you
make
a
name
for
yourself
in
the
world
if
you
can
and
pine
after
what
others
might
have
given
is
a
mere
sergeant
to
make
himself
a
name
sticking
to
his
colours
and
doing
his
duty
like
a
man
officers
have
got
to
the
top
of
the
tree
before
now
why
should
not
you
we
could
only
have
a
chance
of
service
no
other
hope
for
a
soldier
but
we
never
have
any
fighting
in
these
do
you
know
you
be
ready
for
the
chance
when
it
offers
all
got
to
do
get
a
commission
and
hold
yourself
as
high
as
sir
rupert
then
and
meet
him
on
equal
chapter
xiii
farrington
it
seemed
as
if
fate
had
resolved
to
make
gibraltar
the
of
those
with
whom
herbert
larkins
was
destined
to
be
most
closely
concerned
not
long
after
the
rencontre
with
his
best
friends
the
the
news
came
that
general
prioleau
had
been
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
infantry
brigade
upon
the
rock
before
the
year
was
out
the
former
colonel
of
the
own
arrived
with
his
wife
and
little
edith
now
fast
growing
into
a
beautiful
and
attractive
girl
it
was
not
long
before
herbert
saw
her
and
had
an
opportunity
of
noticing
the
change
general
prioleau
like
many
others
of
his
rank
had
a
strong
affection
for
his
old
corps
a
sort
of
sneaking
regard
which
although
it
did
him
all
honour
led
him
to
wish
that
he
still
commanded
it
and
to
act
very
much
as
if
he
did
he
was
not
the
first
general
officer
who
entrusted
with
the
charge
of
several
battalions
narrowed
his
interest
to
the
one
in
which
he
had
himself
served
to
the
own
on
field
days
to
take
an
active
share
in
its
interior
economy
to
watch
over
its
mess
and
all
that
appertained
to
the
credit
of
the
regiment
and
generally
to
be
as
intimately
associated
with
it
as
though
he
were
still
its
colonel
were
delights
he
could
not
forego
he
was
continually
sending
for
colonel
diggle
to
talk
matters
over
an
interference
which
the
great
cavendish
resented
but
was
prohibited
from
protesting
against
by
the
rules
of
the
service
diggle
was
not
and
took
full
advantage
of
her
exemption
from
the
restrictions
of
military
etiquette
to
the
extent
of
soundly
abusing
the
general
upon
every
occasion
not
that
general
prioleau
much
cared
he
did
not
command
and
directly
he
had
made
her
acquaintance
in
her
new
character
he
was
heartily
glad
that
he
did
not
the
general
also
visited
the
barracks
of
his
old
regiment
repeatedly
on
one
excuse
or
another
but
always
with
the
avowed
and
really
sincere
intention
of
doing
it
a
good
turn
now
it
was
the
reappropriation
of
quarters
now
the
examination
of
drainage
now
the
inspection
of
the
married
quarters
or
the
canteen
edith
almost
invariably
accompanied
him
she
was
in
her
element
out
here
upon
the
rock
the
she
now
played
was
even
more
delightful
than
that
of
daughter
of
the
regiment
there
was
much
more
importance
and
more
movement
in
it
more
variety
too
and
more
power
instead
of
knowing
one
regiment
only
she
now
knew
half
a
dozen
the
circle
of
her
acquaintance
widened
and
her
military
knowledge
such
as
it
was
but
her
heart
was
with
her
first
love
always
the
own
when
the
general
inspected
the
old
regiment
she
stayed
by
his
side
through
it
all
they
made
her
go
in
to
lunch
much
to
quiet
indignation
when
she
heard
of
it
she
sat
on
her
pony
close
by
the
general
and
to
judge
by
her
remarks
seemed
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
whole
proceedings
she
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
comments
wheeler
why
getting
quite
old
and
the
gray
why
do
they
keep
him
so
long
father
he
must
be
past
his
work
before
this
and
colonel
diggle
is
he
a
colonel
father
think
so
well
as
you
say
perhaps
not
a
judge
of
colonels
but
i
am
of
gentlemen
and
i
call
him
a
gentleman
not
a
real
gentleman
do
you
dear
the
general
said
reprovingly
are
a
little
too
fast
please
remember
not
a
gentleman
according
to
my
ideas
there
are
lots
of
better
gentlemen
in
the
ranks
why
almost
with
a
shriek
my
friend
the
learned
pig
i
mean
the
learned
orderly
and
father
look
do
look
made
him
a
already
but
her
father
was
not
attending
good
enough
to
form
open
column
pile
arms
and
lay
out
kits
he
was
saying
to
colonel
diggle
which
manœuvre
satisfactorily
carried
out
the
general
continued
his
inspection
on
foot
accompanied
by
his
daughter
who
tripped
along
holding
up
her
habit
nodding
to
old
friends
as
she
went
along
and
so
deeply
interested
in
holdalls
tins
of
blacking
and
pairs
of
socks
that
you
might
have
thought
kit
inspection
was
the
one
joy
of
her
life
am
very
glad
to
see
got
on
so
quickly
she
said
gravely
to
young
larkins
as
she
touched
him
on
the
arm
with
her
whip
by
way
of
emphasis
promised
well
and
i
am
pleased
to
think
i
was
not
disappointed
went
on
the
young
personage
with
the
air
of
a
reviewing
her
troops
it
was
a
gracious
sight
and
one
no
man
an
impressionable
young
sergeant
like
larkins
least
of
all
was
likely
to
forget
the
trim
figure
in
its
habit
the
pretty
bright
face
and
its
framework
of
light
curls
surmounted
with
a
coquettish
little
white
hat
the
air
with
which
she
pointed
with
her
whip
to
his
chevrons
and
the
bright
colours
surmounting
them
as
she
tripped
daintily
along
never
before
or
afterwards
did
edith
prioleau
seem
more
bewitching
and
herbert
larkins
felt
that
he
could
lay
down
his
life
for
her
then
and
there
perhaps
he
talked
a
little
more
about
her
than
he
need
have
done
when
he
next
visited
the
cottage
near
the
moorish
castle
the
house
had
come
to
be
quite
his
home
and
he
went
there
whenever
he
was
off
duty
and
could
spare
time
life
upon
the
rock
was
a
little
monotonous
for
all
below
the
rank
of
officer
and
herbert
was
thankful
that
he
had
friends
in
the
place
the
narrow
limits
of
the
fortress
beyond
which
none
but
the
commissioned
may
pass
except
on
rare
occasions
and
then
only
by
special
permission
forbade
any
great
variety
of
amusement
or
much
change
of
scene
the
rank
and
file
rung
the
changes
upon
and
drinking
shop
when
the
first
was
done
with
for
a
time
they
identified
themselves
with
the
other
after
hours
on
ragged
staff
or
new
mole
at
landport
waterport
or
the
north
front
there
was
an
especial
sweetness
for
the
soldier
in
or
variations
of
the
local
wine
while
for
the
fireproof
head
which
craved
for
the
strongest
stimulants
there
was
the
or
burning
water
a
title
this
engaging
but
curiously
potent
liquid
richly
deserved
for
the
sergeants
in
whom
steadiness
and
sobriety
were
indispensable
traits
these
delights
were
forbidden
and
they
had
but
little
relaxation
after
they
had
completed
their
routine
including
the
preparation
of
small
returns
the
responsibilities
of
minor
commands
beyond
a
stroll
upon
the
alameda
when
the
band
played
or
the
perusal
of
the
newspapers
in
the
mess
herbert
was
more
fortunate
fond
of
books
major
greathed
supplied
him
with
plenty
mainly
of
professional
character
for
although
still
in
subordinate
grades
soldiering
was
becoming
more
and
more
to
our
taste
and
he
was
eager
to
qualify
for
higher
charges
should
it
ever
be
his
good
fortune
to
rise
but
it
was
greater
pleasure
to
him
still
to
talk
at
the
cottage
over
what
he
had
read
to
pour
forth
to
his
mother
as
he
still
called
her
his
ambitious
yearnings
to
express
with
increasing
vehemence
his
vain
regrets
that
he
had
not
lived
in
another
country
and
another
age
wish
i
had
been
a
frenchman
in
the
last
century
no
soldiers
had
such
chances
one
day
a
private
the
next
commanding
a
brigade
never
see
such
things
in
our
be
cast
down
herbert
said
sympathetic
larkins
chance
will
come
if
only
wait
till
and
when
it
comes
it
be
they
may
make
me
a
quartermaster
at
fifty
or
a

lieutenant

i
want
my
cake
now
when
sweet
and
i
am
fit
to
enjoy
offer
half
to
some
one
else
is
that
what
dreaming
about
asked
larkins
with
a
sigh
a
daughter
a
mere
child
too
what
absurdity
to
talk
like
that
no
i
prefer
to
keep
to
my
own
larkins
said
nothing
but
silence
is
sometimes
more
eloquent
than
words
and
mimie
larkins
who
was
present
looked
up
with
a
quick
blush
which
any
man
whose
heart
was
touched
would
have
interpreted
his
own
way
the
fiction
of
the
relationship
between
these
two
had
long
since
melted
away
good
larkins
who
had
hated
herself
for
keeping
a
secret
from
her
husband
had
told
him
the
whole
story
very
soon
after
herbert
had
learnt
the
truth
mimie
too
soon
knew
that
the
handsome
sergeant
who
had
kissed
her
and
called
her
sister
was
really
only
a
cousin
and
as
things
went
a
very
eligible
perhaps
larkins
womanlike
was
a
matchmaker
too
why
should
she
not
encourage
it
herbert
and
her
mimie
were
cut
out
for
each
other
and
if
in
the
long
run
he
should
come
into
his
own
why
should
not
her
daughter
share
his
good
fortune
herbert
was
himself
on
the
point
of
accepting
the
situation
and
succumbing
to
his
fate
mimie
was
attractive
in
no
ordinary
degree
she
was
a
girl
with
a
gentle
confiding
manner
and
very
ways
but
then
herbert
thought
of
his
great
aims
of
the
object
of
his
life
to
marry
at
all
at
his
age
would
be
to
tie
a
millstone
around
his
neck
a
folly
from
which
he
would
never
recover
when
a
man
thinks
thus
there
is
but
little
fear
of
his
falling
desperately
in
love
then
came
the
vision
of
the
little
lady
at
present
so
far
above
him
in
station
and
he
found
himself
drawing
comparisons
in
which
poor
mimie
larkins
came
off
for
a
time
she
resented
it
very
bitterly
was
a
simple
impulsive
nature
she
was
of
a
yielding
malleable
disposition
readily
amenable
to
better
influences
but
she
was
also
like
every
daughter
of
eve
fond
of
admiration
and
grieved
when
it
was
denied
her
heart
was
ready
to
go
out
to
herbert
the
moment
she
knew
he
was
not
her
brother
and
as
time
passed
and
he
made
no
sign
she
grew
more
and
more
discontented
and
cross
now
his
loud
praises
of
this
miss
prioleau
made
her
angrier
than
ever
little
minx
why
did
she
come
poaching
upon
other
preserves
oh
for
a
chance
of
showing
herbert
that
others
were
not
so
blind
as
he
the
chance
came
all
too
soon
it
was
at
a
ball
that
ernest
farrington
first
crossed
her
path
and
threw
himself
at
once
metaphorically
at
her
feet
his
attentions
were
perfectly
respectful
but
very
marked
and
mimie
was
more
than
flattered
by
them
here
indeed
was
a
chance
of
spiting
herbert
and
she
availed
herself
of
it
to
the
full
forgetting
in
the
pleasure
it
gave
her
the
terrible
risk
she
ran
her
clandestine
relations
with
young
farrington
who
was
not
slow
to
follow
up
his
advantage
had
already
become
far
too
intimate
to
promise
well
for
her
peace
of
mind
when
herbert
discovered
all
he
taxed
her
with
meeting
farrington
alone
upon
the
alameda
she
tossed
her
head
first
disdaining
to
reply
then
saucily
asking
what
business
it
was
of
his
shall
tell
your
mother
at
please
do
that
it
would
kill
her
if
she
knew
promise
never
to
meet
him
again
oh
herbert
do
not
get
me
into
such
terrible
trouble
you
of
all
people
to
do
it
too
i
think
you
could
be
so
herbert
was
at
least
he
was
induced
to
spare
larkins
for
the
present
and
determined
to
try
first
an
appeal
to
the
other
side
he
went
to
the
colonel
diggle
and
told
him
all
my
good
fellow
said
the
colonel
no
affair
of
mine
they
belong
to
the
regiment
you
see
i
can
not
interfere
i
am
not
answerable
for
morals
not
herbert
was
not
to
be
done
he
spoke
next
to
ernest
the
first
time
he
got
a
chance
it
sir
what
business
is
it
of
yours
asked
the
officer
hotly
very
much
my
business
she
is
my
sister
at
least
we
were
brought
up
together
as
such
the
sergeant
no
less
hotly
replied
why
you
speak
to
her
instead
of
to
me
i
thought
an
appeal
to
you
as
a
gentleman
there
was
a
plain
sneer
in
his
intonation
i
fancied
you
were
would
have
the
desired
you
dare
to
say
i
am
not
a
gentleman
by
george
dare
do
more
than
that
listen
to
me
farrington
i
swear
you
shall
not
do
her
harm
break
every
bone
in
your
is
rank
mutiny
by
george
a
good
mind
to
put
you
in
arrest
do
you
dare
to
threaten
your
superior
officer
sir
and
ernest
walked
off
as
the
simplest
way
of
ending
the
discussion
herbert
had
one
other
card
to
play
he
wrote
a
full
account
of
the
whole
affair
to
sir
rupert
farrington
and
signed
his
name
sir
rupert
would
probably
have
cared
as
little
for
proceedings
from
the
moral
point
of
view
as
did
diggle
but
he
had
a
not
unnatural
dread
of
entanglements
especially
where
so
weak
a
person
as
his
son
was
concerned
moreover
although
enraged
against
larkins
and
somewhat
uneasy
at
the
tone
of
the
letter
in
which
herbert
made
pointed
reference
to
his
claims
and
hinted
mysteriously
at
certain
close
relations
between
the
and
farringtons
sir
rupert
felt
it
wisest
not
to
enlighten
diggle
further
he
satisfied
himself
with
writing
at
once
to
his
begging
him
to
let
ernest
have
leave
and
send
him
home
this
diggle
did
without
other
reason
than
that
sir
rupert
wished
it
and
ernest
very
obediently
as
it
seemed
fell
into
the
trap
the
young
gentleman
was
however
deeper
than
they
gave
him
credit
for
being
he
went
home
by
the
next
mail
but
mimie
larkins
followed
him
within
a
week
as
soon
as
she
could
give
her
unhappy
parents
the
slip
and
thus
for
the
second
time
larkins
had
reason
to
curse
the
farrington
