chapter
i
hard
young
hearts
behind
the
venetian
blinds
of
a
respectable
family
house
in
a
respectable
road
of
the
little
town
of
sidon
midway
between
the
trees
of
wealth
upon
the
hill
and
the
business
quarters
that
ended
in
squalor
on
the
bank
of
the
broad
and
busy
river
a
house
boasting
a
few
shabby
trees
of
its
own
in
its
damp
little
rockeried
slips
of
front
and
back
gardens
on
a
may
evening
some
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
a
momentous
crisis
of
contrasts
had
been
reached
the
house
was
still
as
for
a
battle
it
was
holding
its
breath
to
hear
what
was
going
on
in
the
front
parlour
the
door
of
which
seemed
to
wear
an
expression
of
being
more
than
usually
closed
a
mournful
fell
through
a
little
vestibule
into
a
hall
on
the
walls
of
which
hung
several
pictures
of
those
great
steamships
known
as
atlantic
liners
in
big
gilt
frames
pictures
of
a
significance
presently
to
be
noted
a
beautiful
old
clock
ticked
solemnly
to
the
flickering
of
the
hall
lamp
from
below
came
occasionally
a
furtive
creaking
of
the
kitchen
stairs
the
two
servants
were
half
way
up
them
listening
the
stairs
a
flight
above
the
hall
also
creaked
at
intervals
two
young
girls
respectively
about
fourteen
and
fifteen
were
craning
necks
out
of
nightdresses
over
the
balusters
in
a
shadowy
angle
of
the
staircase
on
the
floor
above
them
three
other
little
girls
of
gradually
diminishing
ages
slept
unconscious
of
the
issues
being
decided
between
their
big
brother
and
their
eldest
sister
on
the
one
side
and
their
father
and
mother
on
the
other
in
the
front
parlour
below
that
parlour
a
room
of
good
size
was
unostentatiously
furnished
with
good
bourgeois
mahogany
a
buxom
mahogany
chiffonier
a
large
square
a
black
marble
clock
with
two
dials
one
being
a
barometer
three
large
oil
landscapes
of
exceedingly
umbrageous
trees
and
glassy
lakes
inoffensively
uninteresting
more
atlantic
liners
and
a
large
bookcase
apparently
filled
with
serried
lines
of
bound
magazines
and
an
excellent
brussels
carpet
of
quiet
pattern
were
mainly
responsible
for
a
general
effect
of
comfort
in
which
indeed
if
beauty
had
not
been
included
it
had
not
been
wilfully
violated
but
merely
unthought
of
the
young
people
for
whom
these
familiar
objects
meant
a
symbolism
in
their
earliest
memories
could
hardly
in
fairness
have
declared
anything
positively
painful
in
that
room
except
perhaps
those
atlantic
liners
their
charges
against
furniture
which
was
unconsciously
to
them
accumulating
memories
that
would
some
day
bring
tears
of
tenderness
to
their
eyes
could
only
have
been
negative
beauty
had
been
left
out
but
at
least
ugliness
had
not
been
ostentatiously
called
in
there
was
no
bad
taste
in
fact
whatever
the
individual
character
of
each
component
object
there
was
included
in
the
general
effect
a
certain
indefinable
dignity
which
had
doubtless
nothing
to
do
with
the
mahogany
but
was
probably
one
of
those
subtle
atmospheric
impressions
which
a
room
takes
from
the
people
who
habitually
live
in
it
had
you
entered
that
room
when
it
was
empty
you
would
instinctively
have
felt
that
it
was
accustomed
to
the
occupancy
of
calm
and
refined
people
there
was
something
almost
religious
in
its
quiet
some
one
often
sat
there
who
whatever
his
commonplace
disguises
as
a
provincial
man
of
business
however
inadequate
to
his
powers
the
work
life
had
given
him
to
do
provincial
and
humiliating
as
were
the
formulae
with
which
narrowing
conditions
had
supplied
him
for
expression
of
himself
was
in
his
central
being
an
aristocrat
though
that
was
the
very
last
word
james
mesurier
would
have
thought
of
applying
to
himself
he
was
a
man
of
business
serving
god
and
his
employers
with
stern
uprightness
and
bringing
up
a
large
family
with
something
of
the
puritan
severity
which
had
marked
his
own
early
training
and
as
in
his
own
case
no
such
allowance
had
been
made
making
no
allowance
in
his
rigid
abstract
code
for
the
diverse
temperaments
of
his
children
children
in
whom
certain
qualities
and
needs
of
his
own
nature
dormant
from
his
birth
were
awakening
supplemented
by
the
intelligence
and
richer
nature
of
the
mother
into
expansive
and
rebellious
individualities
it
was
now
about
eleven
and
the
house
was
thus
lit
and
alive
beyond
the
rigorously
enforced
an
hour
before
james
mesurier
had
been
peacefully
engaged
on
the
task
which
had
been
nightly
with
him
at
this
hour
for
years
the
writing
of
his
diary
in
a
shorthand
which
he
wrote
with
a
neatness
almost
a
daintiness
that
always
marked
his
use
of
pen
and
ink
and
gave
to
his
merely
commercial
correspondence
and
his
quite
exquisitely
kept
accounts
a
certain
touch
of
the
scholar
again
an
air
of
distinction
in
excess
of
and
unaccounted
for
by
the
nature
of
the
interests
which
it
dignified
his
somewhat
narrow
range
of
reading
had
you
followed
it
by
his
careful
markings
through
those
bound
volumes
of
sermons
in
the
bookcase
bore
the
same
evidence
of
inherited
and
inadequately
occupied
refinement
his
life
from
boyhood
had
been
too
much
of
a
struggle
to
leave
him
much
leisure
for
reading
and
such
as
he
had
enjoyed
had
been
diverted
into
evangelical
channels
by
the
influence
of
a
certain
pious
old
lady
with
whom
as
a
young
man
he
had
boarded
and
for
whose
memory
all
his
life
he
cherished
a
reverence
little
short
of
the
name
of
quiggins
whose
portrait
had
still
a
conspicuous
niche
among
the
of
the
household
a
little
thin
silvery
old
suggesting
great
sadness
much
gentleness
and
a
little
severity
had
thus
become
for
the
family
of
james
mesurier
a
symbol
of
sanctity
with
which
a
properly
accredited
saint
of
the
calendar
could
certainly
not
in
that
protestant
home
have
competed
it
was
she
who
had
given
him
that
little
bible
which
lay
on
the
table
with
his
letters
and
papers
as
he
wrote
under
the
lamplight
and
than
which
a
world
full
of
sacred
relics
contains
none
more
sacred
a
elastic
band
encircled
its
covers
as
a
precaution
against
pages
becoming
loose
with
much
turning
and
inside
you
would
have
found
scarcely
a
chapter
unpencilled
texts
underlined
and
sermons
of
special
helpfulness
noted
by
date
and
preacher
on
the
margin
the
itinerary
of
a
devout
human
soul
on
its
way
through
this
world
to
the
next
the
bible
and
the
sermons
of
a
certain
famous
nonconformist
divine
of
the
day
were
james
mesurier
favourite
and
practically
his
only
reading
at
this
time
though
as
a
young
man
he
had
picked
up
a
fair
education
for
himself
and
had
taken
a
certain
interest
in
modern
history
for
novels
he
had
not
merely
disapproval
but
absolutely
no
taste
once
in
a
specially
genial
mood
he
had
undertaken
to
try
ivanhoe
to
please
his
favourite
daughter
this
night
in
revolt
against
him
and
in
he
had
been
surprised
with
laughter
sound
asleep
the
sermon
that
would
send
him
to
sleep
had
never
been
written
at
all
events
by
his
favourite
theologian
whose
sermons
he
read
every
sunday
afternoon
and
annotated
with
that
same
loving
appreciation
and
careful
pencil
with
which
a
scholar
annotates
some
classic
so
true
is
it
that
it
is
we
who
dignify
our
occupations
not
they
us
similarly
james
mesurier
presided
over
the
destinies
of
a
large
commercial
undertaking
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
been
called
rather
to
direct
an
empire
than
a
business
you
would
say
as
he
went
by
there
goes
one
accustomed
to
rule
accustomed
to
be
regarded
with
great
respect
but
that
air
had
been
his
long
before
the
authority
that
once
more
inadequately
accounted
for
it
thus
this
night
as
he
sat
writing
his
handsome
rather
small
head
bent
over
his
papers
his
face
somewhat
french
in
character
his
short
beard
slightly
pointed
distinguished
refined
severe
he
had
the
look
of
a
marshal
of
france
engrossed
with
documents
of
state
the
mother
who
sat
in
an
armchair
by
the
fire
reading
was
a
woman
of
about
with
a
fine
blonde
aquiline
face
distinctively
english
and
radiating
intelligence
from
its
large
sympathetic
lines
she
was
in
some
respects
so
different
from
her
husband
as
at
times
to
make
children
precociously
wise
but
nevertheless
far
from
knowing
everything
wonder
why
she
had
ever
married
their
father
for
whom
at
that
time
it
would
be
hypocrisy
to
describe
their
attitude
as
one
of
love
to
them
he
was
not
so
much
a
father
as
the
policeman
of
home
a
personification
of
stern
negative
decrees
a
systematic
thwarter
of
almost
everything
they
most
cared
to
do
he
was
a
sort
of
embodied
thou
shalt
not
only
to
be
won
into
acquiescence
by
one
influence
that
of
the
mother
whose
married
life
as
she
looked
back
on
it
seemed
to
consist
of
little
else
than
bringing
children
into
the
world
with
a
regularity
and
interceding
with
the
father
for
their
varying
temperaments
when
there
though
it
might
have
been
regarded
as
certain
beforehand
that
seven
children
would
differ
each
from
each
other
in
at
least
as
many
ways
it
never
seems
to
have
occurred
to
the
father
that
one
inflexible
system
for
them
all
could
hardly
be
wise
or
comfortable
but
indeed
like
so
many
parents
similarly
trained
and
circumstanced
it
is
questionable
whether
he
ever
realised
their
possession
of
separate
individualities
till
they
were
pleaded
for
by
the
mother
or
made
as
on
this
evening
surprising
assertion
of
themselves
though
this
system
of
mediation
had
been
responsible
for
the
only
disagreements
in
their
married
life
there
had
never
been
any
long
or
serious
difference
between
husband
and
wife
for
in
spite
of
natures
so
different
they
loved
each
other
with
that
love
which
is
given
us
for
the
very
purpose
of
such
situations
the
love
that
no
strain
can
snap
the
love
that
reconciles
all
such
disparities
though
mary
mesurier
had
also
been
brought
up
among
nonconformists
and
though
the
conditions
of
her
youth
like
her
husband
had
been
far
from
adequate
to
the
demands
of
her
nature
yet
her
religion
had
been
of
a
gentler
character
broadening
instead
of
narrowing
in
its
effects
and
had
concerned
itself
less
with
divinity
than
humanity
her
home
life
if
humble
had
been
genial
and
rich
in
love
and
there
had
come
into
it
generous
influences
from
the
outer
world
books
with
more
of
the
human
beat
in
them
than
is
to
be
found
in
sermons
and
particularly
an
old
travelled
grandfather
who
had
been
regarded
as
the
rolling
stone
of
his
family
but
in
whom
at
all
events
failure
and
travel
had
developed
a
great
gentleness
and
understanding
of
the
human
creature
which
in
long
walks
and
talks
with
his
little
somehow
passed
over
into
her
young
character
and
proved
the
best
legacy
he
could
have
left
her
through
him
too
was
encouraged
a
native
love
of
poetry
of
which
in
her
childhood
her
memory
acquired
a
stock
which
never
failed
her
and
which
had
often
cheered
her
lonely
hours
by
successive
cradles
she
had
a
fine
natural
gift
of
recitation
and
in
evening
hours
when
the
home
was
particularly
united
in
some
glow
of
visitors
or
birthday
celebration
she
would
be
persuaded
to
recall
some
of
those
old
songs
and
simple
apologues
with
such
charm
that
even
her
husband
to
whom
verse
was
naturally
an
incomprehensible
triviality
was
visibly
softened
and
perhaps
deep
in
the
sadness
of
his
silent
nature
moved
to
a
passing
realisation
of
a
certain
something
kind
and
musical
in
life
which
he
had
strangely
missed
this
greater
breadth
of
temperament
and
training
enabled
mary
mesurier
to
understand
and
make
allowances
for
the
narrower
and
harder
nature
of
her
husband
whom
she
learnt
in
time
rather
to
pity
for
the
bleakness
of
his
early
days
than
to
condemn
for
their
effect
upon
his
character
he
was
strong
good
clever
and
handsome
and
exceptionally
all
those
four
good
reasons
for
loving
him
and
the
intellectual
sympathy
the
sharing
of
broader
interests
which
she
sometimes
missed
in
him
she
had
for
some
three
or
four
years
come
to
find
in
her
eldest
son
who
to
his
father
bewilderment
and
disappointment
had
reincarnated
his
own
strong
will
in
connection
with
literary
practices
and
dreams
which
threatened
to
end
in
his
becoming
a
poet
instead
of
the
business
man
expected
of
him
for
which
development
that
love
of
poetry
in
one
parent
and
a
certain
love
of
books
in
both
was
no
doubt
to
some
degree
guiltily
responsible
james
mesurier
as
we
have
said
was
no
judge
of
poetry
and
had
he
been
so
a
reading
of
his
son
early
effusions
would
have
made
him
still
more
obdurate
in
the
choice
for
him
of
a
commercial
career
but
on
general
principles
he
was
quite
sufficiently
firm
against
any
but
the
most
flirtation
with
the
muse
the
mother
while
agreeing
with
the
father
main
proposition
of
the
undesirability
nay
impossibility
of
literature
as
a
livelihood
had
not
the
great
and
successful
sir
walter
himself
described
it
as
a
good
but
a
poor
crutch
a
stick
applied
since
its
first
application
as
an
image
to
the
shoulders
of
how
many
generations
of
youthful
genius
was
naturally
more
sympathetic
towards
her
son
ambition
and
encouraged
it
to
the
extent
of
helping
from
her
housekeeping
money
the
formation
of
his
little
library
even
occasionally
proving
successful
in
winning
sums
of
money
from
the
father
for
the
purchase
of
some
book
specially
as
the
young
man
would
declare
necessary
for
his
development
as
this
little
library
had
outgrown
the
accommodation
of
the
common
rooms
a
daring
scheme
had
been
conceived
between
mother
and
son
no
less
than
that
he
should
have
a
small
room
set
apart
for
himself
as
a
study
when
first
broached
to
the
father
this
scheme
had
met
with
an
absolute
denial
that
seemed
to
promise
no
hope
of
further
consideration
but
the
mother
accepting
defeat
at
the
time
had
tried
again
and
again
with
patient
dexterity
at
favourable
moments
till
at
last
one
proud
day
the
little
room
with
its
bookshelves
a
cast
of
dante
and
a
strange
picture
or
two
was
a
beautiful
significant
fact
all
ready
for
the
possible
visitation
of
the
muse
in
such
ways
had
the
mother
negotiated
the
needs
of
all
her
children
though
the
youth
of
the
rest
save
the
eldest
girl
whose
music
lessons
had
meant
a
battle
and
whose
growing
attractiveness
for
the
boys
of
the
district
and
one
in
particular
was
presently
to
mean
another
made
as
yet
but
small
demands
in
one
question
however
periodically
fruitful
of
argument
even
the
youngest
was
becoming
interested
the
question
of
the
visits
to
the
household
of
the
various
friends
and
playmates
of
the
children
to
these
it
must
be
admitted
james
mesurier
was
apt
to
be
hardly
less
of
a
figure
of
fear
than
to
his
own
children
for
apart
from
the
fact
that
such
inroads
from
without
were
apt
to
disturb
his
few
quiet
evening
hours
with
rollicking
and
laughter
he
being
entirely
unsocial
in
his
own
nature
had
a
curious
idea
that
the
family
should
be
sufficient
to
itself
and
that
the
desire
for
any
form
of
entertainment
outside
it
was
a
sign
of
dissatisfaction
with
god
gifts
of
a
good
home
and
generally
a
frivolity
to
be
discouraged
as
a
boy
he
had
grown
up
without
companions
and
as
a
man
had
remained
lonely
till
he
had
met
in
his
wife
the
one
comrade
of
his
days
what
had
been
good
enough
for
their
father
should
be
good
enough
for
his
children
was
a
formula
which
he
applied
all
round
to
their
bringing
up
curiously
forgetful
for
a
man
at
heart
so
just
of
the
pleasure
one
would
have
expected
it
to
be
to
make
sure
that
the
errors
of
his
own
training
were
not
repeated
in
that
of
his
offspring
but
indeed
there
was
in
him
constitutionally
something
of
the
puritan
suspicion
of
and
aversion
from
pleasure
which
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
consider
as
the
end
of
or
indeed
as
a
considerable
element
of
existence
life
was
somehow
too
serious
for
play
spiritually
as
well
as
materially
and
much
work
and
a
little
rest
was
the
eternal
and
on
the
whole
salutary
lot
of
man
such
were
some
of
the
conditions
among
which
the
young
mesuriers
found
themselves
and
of
which
their
impatience
had
become
momentously
explosive
this
february
evening
for
some
days
there
had
been
an
energetic
simmer
of
rebellion
among
the
four
elder
children
against
a
new
edict
of
early
rising
which
was
surely
somewhat
arbitrary
early
rising
was
one
of
james
mesurier
articles
of
faith
and
he
was
always
up
and
dressed
by
six
though
there
was
no
breakfast
till
eight
and
absolutely
no
necessity
for
his
rising
at
that
hour
beyond
his
own
desire
there
was
still
less
indeed
none
at
all
for
his
children
to
rise
thus
early
but
nevertheless
he
had
recently
decreed
that
such
for
the
future
must
be
the
rule
the
rule
fell
heaviest
upon
the
sisters
for
the
elder
brother
had
always
enjoyed
a
certain
immunity
from
such
edicts
his
sense
of
justice
however
kindled
none
the
less
at
this
final
piece
of
tyranny
he
blazed
and
fumed
indignantly
on
behalf
of
his
sisters
in
the
sanctuary
of
that
little
study
a
spot
where
the
despot
seldom
set
foot
and
out
of
this
comparatively
trivial
cause
had
sprung
a
mighty
resolution
which
he
and
she
whom
he
proudly
honoured
as
sister
and
friend
had
after
some
girding
of
the
loins
repaired
to
the
front
parlour
this
evening
to
communicate
they
had
entered
somewhat
abruptly
and
stood
rather
dramatically
by
the
table
on
which
the
father
was
writing
the
son
with
dark
set
face
in
which
could
be
seen
both
the
father
and
mother
and
the
daughter
timid
and
close
to
him
resolutely
keeping
back
her
tears
a
slim
young
copy
of
the
mother
well
my
dears
said
the
father
looking
up
with
a
keen
rather
surprised
glance
and
in
a
tone
which
qualified
with
some
severity
the
my
dears
the
son
had
had
some
exceedingly
fine
beginnings
in
his
head
but
they
fled
ignominiously
with
the
calm
that
was
necessary
for
their
successful
delivery
and
he
blurted
at
once
to
the
point
we
have
come
to
say
that
we
are
no
longer
comfortable
at
home
and
have
decided
to
leave
it
henry
exclaimed
the
mother
hastily
what
do
you
mean
how
can
you
be
so
ungrateful
mary
my
dear
interrupted
the
father
please
leave
the
matter
to
me
then
turning
to
the
son
what
is
this
you
are
saying
i
afraid
i
do
understand
i
mean
that
esther
and
i
have
decided
to
leave
home
and
live
together
because
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
live
here
any
longer
in
happiness
on
what
do
you
propose
to
live
my
salary
will
be
sufficient
for
the
present
sixty
pounds
a
year
yes
and
may
i
ask
what
is
wrong
with
your
home
you
have
every
comfort
far
more
than
your
mother
or
father
were
accustomed
to
yes
indeed
echoed
the
mother
yes
we
know
you
are
very
good
and
kind
and
mean
everything
for
our
good
but
you
do
understand
other
needs
of
our
natures
and
you
make
no
allowance
for
our
individualities
indeed
individualities
i
should
like
you
to
have
heard
what
my
father
would
have
said
to
talk
about
individualities
a
rope
end
would
have
been
his
answer
to
that
it
would
have
been
a
very
silly
one
and
no
argument
it
would
have
been
effective
at
all
events
not
with
me
well
please
do
bandy
words
with
me
sir
if
you
particularly
addressing
his
son
wish
to
go
then
go
but
remember
that
once
you
have
left
your
father
roof
you
leave
it
for
ever
as
for
your
sister
she
has
no
power
to
leave
her
mother
and
father
without
my
consent
and
that
i
shall
certainly
withhold
till
she
is
of
a
proper
age
to
know
what
is
best
for
herself
she
will
go
then
without
your
consent
defiantly
answered
the
son
oh
henry
for
shame
exclaimed
mesurier
mother
dear
i
sorry
we
do
mean
to
be
disrespectful
or
undutiful
but
father
petty
tyrannies
are
more
than
we
can
bear
he
objects
to
the
friends
we
care
for
he
denies
us
the
theatre
most
certainly
and
shall
continue
to
do
so
i
have
never
been
inside
a
theatre
in
my
life
nor
with
my
consent
shall
any
child
of
mine
enter
one
of
them
you
can
evidently
know
little
about
them
then
and
you
be
a
much
finer
man
if
you
had
flashed
out
the
son
your
sitting
in
judgment
on
your
father
is
certainly
very
pretty
i
must
say
answered
the
father
very
pretty
and
i
can
only
hope
that
you
will
not
have
cause
to
regret
it
some
future
day
but
i
can
not
allow
you
to
disturb
me
for
with
something
of
a
pang
henry
noticed
signs
of
agitation
amid
the
severity
of
his
parent
though
the
matter
was
too
momentous
for
him
to
allow
the
indulgence
of
pity
you
have
been
a
source
of
much
anxiety
to
your
mother
and
me
a
child
of
many
prayers
the
father
continued
whether
it
is
the
books
you
read
or
the
friends
you
associate
with
that
are
responsible
for
your
strange
and
to
my
thinking
impious
opinions
i
do
not
know
but
this
i
know
that
your
influence
on
your
sister
has
not
of
late
been
for
good
and
for
her
sake
and
the
sake
of
your
young
sisters
it
may
perhaps
be
well
that
your
influence
in
the
home
be
removed
oh
james
exclaimed
the
wife
mary
my
dear
you
must
let
me
finish
if
henry
will
go
go
he
shall
but
if
he
still
stays
he
must
learn
that
i
am
master
in
this
house
and
that
while
i
remain
so
not
he
but
i
shall
dictate
how
it
is
to
be
carried
on
it
was
at
this
point
that
esther
ventured
to
lift
the
girlish
tremor
of
her
voice
but
father
if
you
forgive
my
saying
so
i
think
it
would
be
best
for
another
reason
for
us
to
go
there
are
too
many
of
us
we
room
to
grow
we
get
in
each
other
way
and
then
it
would
ease
you
it
would
be
less
expense
when
i
complain
of
having
to
support
my
children
it
will
be
time
to
speak
of
that
but
you
have
complained
hotly
interrupted
the
son
you
have
reproached
us
many
a
time
for
what
we
cost
you
for
clothes
and
food
yes
when
you
have
shown
yourselves
ungrateful
for
them
as
you
do
ungrateful
for
what
should
we
be
grateful
that
you
do
your
bare
duty
of
feeding
and
clothing
us
and
even
for
that
expect
in
my
case
at
all
events
that
i
shall
prove
so
much
business
capital
invested
for
the
future
was
it
we
who
asked
to
come
into
the
world
did
you
consult
us
or
did
you
beget
us
for
anything
but
your
own
selfish
pleasure
without
a
thought
henry
got
no
further
his
father
had
grown
white
and
with
terrible
anger
pointed
to
the
door
leave
the
room
sir
he
said
and
leave
my
house
for
ever
the
son
was
not
cowed
he
stood
with
an
unflinching
defiance
before
the
father
in
whom
he
forgot
the
father
and
saw
only
the
tyrant
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
some
unnatural
blow
would
be
struck
but
so
much
of
pain
was
spared
the
future
memory
of
the
scene
and
saying
only
it
is
true
for
all
that
he
turned
and
left
the
room
the
sister
followed
him
in
silence
and
the
door
closed
mother
and
father
looked
at
each
other
they
had
brought
up
children
they
had
suffered
and
toiled
for
them
that
they
should
talk
to
them
like
this
mesurier
came
over
to
her
husband
and
put
her
arm
tenderly
on
his
shoulder
never
mind
dear
i
sure
he
did
mean
to
talk
like
that
he
is
a
good
boy
at
heart
but
you
do
understand
each
other
mary
dear
we
will
talk
no
more
of
it
he
replied
i
will
try
and
put
it
from
me
you
go
to
bed
i
will
finish
my
diary
and
be
up
in
a
few
minutes
when
he
was
alone
he
sat
still
a
little
while
with
a
great
lonely
pain
on
his
face
and
almost
visibly
upon
it
too
the
smart
of
the
wounded
pride
of
his
haughty
nature
never
in
his
life
had
he
been
spoken
to
like
that
and
by
his
own
son
the
pang
of
it
was
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
but
presently
he
had
so
far
mastered
himself
as
to
take
up
his
pen
and
continue
his
writing
when
that
was
finished
he
opened
his
bible
and
read
his
wonted
chapter
it
was
just
the
simple
psalm
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
i
shall
not
want
it
was
his
favourite
psalm
and
always
had
a
remarkable
tranquillising
effect
upon
him
james
mesurier
faith
in
god
was
very
great
then
he
knelt
down
and
prayed
in
silence
prayed
with
a
great
love
for
his
disobedient
children
and
when
he
rose
from
his
knees
anger
and
pain
had
been
washed
away
from
his
face
and
a
serenity
that
is
not
of
this
world
was
there
instead
chapter
ii
concerning
those
atlantic
liners
and
an
old
desk
of
all
battles
in
this
complicated
civil
warfare
of
human
life
none
is
more
painful
than
that
being
constantly
waged
from
generation
to
generation
between
young
and
old
and
none
it
would
appear
more
inevitable
or
indeed
necessary
the
good
gods
sigh
for
the
cost
and
pain
and
as
growing
older
ourselves
we
become
spectators
of
such
a
conflict
with
eyes
able
to
see
the
real
goodness
and
truth
of
both
combatants
how
often
must
we
exclaim
oh
just
for
a
little
touch
of
sympathetic
comprehension
on
either
side
and
yet
after
all
it
is
from
the
older
generation
that
we
have
a
right
to
expect
that
if
that
vaunted
experience
with
which
they
are
accustomed
to
extinguish
the
voice
of
the
young
means
anything
it
should
surely
include
some
knowledge
of
the
needs
of
expanding
youth
and
be
prepared
to
meet
them
not
in
a
spirit
of
despotic
denial
but
in
that
of
thoughtful
provision
the
young
can
not
afford
to
be
generous
even
if
they
possess
the
necessary
insight
it
would
mean
their
losing
their
battle
a
battle
very
necessary
for
them
to
win
sometimes
it
would
seem
that
a
very
little
kindly
explanation
on
the
part
of
the
elder
would
set
the
younger
at
a
point
of
view
where
greater
sympathy
would
be
possible
the
great
demand
of
the
young
is
for
some
form
of
poetry
in
their
lives
and
surroundings
and
it
is
largely
the
fault
of
the
old
if
the
poetry
of
one
generation
is
almost
invariably
the
prose
of
the
next
those
atlantic
liners
are
an
illustration
of
my
meaning
to
the
young
mesuriers
they
were
hideous
in
vulgar
gilt
frames
arbitrary
defacements
of
home
but
undoubtedly
even
they
would
have
found
a
tolerant
tenderness
for
them
had
they
realised
that
they
represented
the
poetry
long
since
renounced
and
put
behind
him
of
james
mesurier
life
he
had
come
of
a
race
of
two
of
his
brothers
had
been
sailors
and
deep
down
in
his
heart
the
spirit
of
romance
answered
with
voice
fresh
and
young
as
ever
to
any
breath
or
association
of
the
sea
but
he
seldom
if
ever
spoke
of
it
and
only
in
an
anecdote
or
two
was
it
occasionally
brought
to
mind
sometimes
his
wife
would
tease
him
with
the
vanity
which
on
holidays
by
the
sea
would
send
him
forth
on
blustering
tempestuous
nights
clad
in
a
greatcoat
of
blue
and
a
sealskin
cap
and
tell
how
proud
he
was
on
one
occasion
as
he
stood
on
the
wharf
at
being
addressed
as
captain
and
asked
what
ship
he
had
brought
into
port
even
the
hard
heart
of
youth
must
soften
at
such
a
reminiscence
then
scattered
about
the
house
was
many
a
prosaic
bit
of
furniture
which
was
musical
with
memories
for
the
parents
memories
of
their
first
little
homes
and
their
early
struggles
together
this
now
relegated
to
the
children
had
once
been
their
de
in
such
and
such
a
street
twelve
years
ago
before
their
children
had
risen
up
and
not
called
them
blessed
a
few
years
and
the
light
of
poetry
will
be
upon
these
things
for
their
children
too
but
meanwhile
can
we
blame
them
that
they
can
not
accept
the
poetry
of
their
elders
in
exchange
for
that
of
their
own
which
they
are
impatient
to
make
and
when
that
poetry
is
made
and
resident
in
similar
concrete
objects
of
home
how
will
it
seem
one
wonders
to
their
children
this
old
desk
which
esther
has
been
allowed
to
appropriate
and
in
a
secret
drawer
of
which
are
already
accumulating
certain
and
lavender
will
it
ever
one
wonders
turn
to
lumber
in
younger
hands
for
a
little
while
she
leans
her
sweet
young
bosom
against
it
and
writes
scented
letters
in
a
girlish
hand
to
a
little
boy
who
has
these
past
weeks
begun
to
love
her
can
it
be
possible
that
the
desk
on
which
esther
once
wrote
to
her
little
mike
will
ever
hear
itself
spoken
of
as
this
ugly
old
thing
let
us
hope
not
chapter
iii
of
the
love
of
henry
and
esther
father
and
son
had
both
meant
what
they
said
and
even
the
mother
for
whom
it
would
be
the
cruellest
wrench
of
all
knew
that
henry
was
going
to
leave
home
not
literally
on
the
morrow
for
the
following
evening
he
had
appeared
before
his
father
to
apologise
for
the
manner
carefully
for
the
manner
not
in
which
he
had
spoken
to
him
the
evening
before
and
asked
for
a
day
or
two
in
which
to
make
his
arrangements
for
departure
james
mesurier
was
too
strong
a
man
to
be
resentful
and
he
accepted
his
son
apology
with
a
gentleness
that
as
each
knew
detracted
nothing
from
the
resolution
which
each
had
come
to
my
boy
he
said
you
will
never
have
such
good
friends
as
your
father
and
mother
but
it
is
best
that
you
go
out
into
the
world
to
learn
it
there
is
something
terribly
winning
and
unnerving
to
the
blackest
resolution
when
the
severity
of
the
strong
dissolves
for
a
brief
moment
into
tenderness
the
rare
kind
words
of
the
stern
explain
it
as
we
will
and
unjust
as
the
preference
must
surely
be
one
values
beyond
the
frequent
forgivenesses
of
the
gentle
mary
mesurier
would
have
laid
down
her
life
in
defence
of
her
son
greatest
fault
and
james
mesurier
would
as
readily
have
him
for
his
smallest
and
yet
somehow
a
kind
word
from
him
brought
the
tears
to
his
son
eyes
he
had
no
longer
the
heart
to
stimulate
the
rebellion
of
esther
as
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
do
and
to
her
disappointment
he
announced
that
on
the
whole
it
would
perhaps
be
best
for
him
to
go
alone
it
would
almost
kill
poor
mother
he
said
and
father
means
well
after
all
he
added
i
afraid
it
would
break
father
heart
said
esther
so
these
two
young
people
agreed
to
spare
their
parents
though
let
it
not
be
otherwise
imagined
at
a
great
sacrifice
the
little
paper
on
which
they
had
carefully
worked
out
their
housekeeping
skilfully
allotting
so
much
for
rent
butcher
meat
milk
coals
and
washing
and
making
everything
come
most
optimistically
to
a
year
would
be
of
no
use
now
at
all
events
for
the
present
their
little
charles
and
mary
lamb
dream
must
be
laid
aside
for
of
course
they
had
thought
of
charles
and
mary
lamb
and
indeed
out
beyond
this
history
of
a
few
youthful
years
their
friendship
was
to
prove
itself
far
from
unworthy
of
its
famous
model
yet
at
this
time
it
was
of
no
great
antiquity
for
but
a
very
few
years
back
henry
had
been
a
miniature
tyrant
too
and
ruled
it
over
his
kingdom
of
six
sisters
with
all
the
hideous
egoism
of
a
pampered
son
and
heir
although
in
the
very
middle
class
of
society
into
which
henry
mesurier
was
born
the
dignity
of
eldest
son
is
one
but
very
contingently
connected
with
tangible
inheritance
it
is
none
the
less
vigorously
kept
up
and
no
doubt
without
any
consciousness
of
partiality
henry
mesurier
from
his
childhood
had
been
brought
up
to
regard
himself
as
a
sort
of
young
prince
for
whom
all
the
privileges
of
home
were
by
divine
right
reserved
for
example
he
took
his
meals
with
his
parents
fully
five
years
before
any
of
his
sisters
were
allowed
to
do
so
and
for
retention
of
this
privilege
when
at
length
the
democratic
measure
of
its
extension
to
his
two
elder
sisters
was
proposed
he
fought
with
the
bitterest
spirit
of
caste
indeed
few
oligarchs
have
been
more
wildly
hated
than
henry
mesurier
up
to
the
age
say
of
fourteen
that
was
the
age
of
his
last
thrashing
and
it
was
in
the
gloomy
dusk
of
that
momentous
occasion
as
he
lay
alone
with
smarting
back
in
the
twilight
of
an
unusually
early
that
a
possible
new
view
of
woman
as
a
creature
of
like
passions
and
privileges
presented
itself
to
him
his
thrashing
had
been
so
unjustly
severe
that
even
the
granite
little
hearts
of
his
sisters
had
been
softened
and
esther
managing
to
secrete
a
cake
that
he
loved
from
the
tea
that
was
lost
to
him
stole
with
it
to
the
top
of
the
house
where
he
writhed
amid
lonely
echoes
and
shadows
she
had
brought
it
to
him
awkwardly
by
no
means
sure
of
its
reception
but
sure
in
her
heart
that
she
would
hate
him
for
ever
if
he
missed
the
meaning
of
the
little
solatium
but
fortunately
his
back
was
far
too
sore
and
his
spirit
too
broken
to
remember
his
pride
and
he
accepted
the
offering
with
gratitude
and
tears
kiss
me
esther
he
had
said
and
a
wonderful
thrill
had
gone
through
the
little
girl
at
this
strange
softness
in
the
mighty
while
the
dawn
of
a
wonderful
pity
for
the
lot
of
woman
had
unconsciously
broken
in
the
soul
of
the
boy
kiss
me
again
esther
he
had
said
and
with
the
tears
that
mingled
in
that
kiss
an
eternal
friendship
was
baptized
henry
rose
on
the
morrow
a
changed
being
the
grosser
pretensions
of
the
male
had
fallen
from
him
for
ever
and
there
was
at
first
something
almost
to
his
sisters
in
the
gentle
solicitude
for
them
and
their
rights
and
pleasures
which
replaced
the
old
despotism
from
that
time
esther
and
he
became
closer
and
closer
companions
and
as
they
more
and
more
formed
an
oligarchy
of
two
a
rearrangement
of
parties
in
the
little
parliament
of
home
came
about
to
be
upset
again
as
dot
and
mat
qualified
for
admission
into
that
exclusive
little
circle
so
soon
as
henry
had
a
new
dream
or
a
new
thought
he
shared
it
with
esther
and
freely
as
he
had
received
from
carlyle
or
emerson
or
thoreau
freely
he
passed
it
on
to
her
for
the
gloomiest
occasion
he
had
some
strengthening
text
and
one
of
the
last
things
he
did
before
he
left
home
was
to
make
for
her
a
little
book
which
he
called
faith
for
cloudy
days
consisting
of
energising
and
sustaining
phrases
from
certain
great
writers
as
it
were
a
bottle
of
philosophical
phosphates
against
seasons
of
spiritual
cowardice
or
debility
there
one
opened
and
read
the
worst
turns
best
to
the
or
thoreau
have
yet
to
hear
a
single
word
of
wisdom
spoken
to
me
by
my
elders
or
again
matthew
in
hours
of
insight
willed
may
be
through
hours
of
gloom
james
mesurier
knew
nothing
of
all
this
but
if
he
had
he
might
have
understood
that
after
all
his
children
were
not
so
far
from
the
kingdom
of
heaven
chapter
iv
of
the
professions
that
choose
and
mike
laflin
however
we
may
hint
at
its
explanation
by
theories
of
inheritance
it
still
remains
curious
with
what
unerring
instinct
a
child
of
character
will
from
the
first
and
when
it
is
so
evidently
ignorant
of
the
field
of
choice
select
out
of
all
life
occupations
and
distinctions
one
special
work
it
hungers
to
do
one
special
distinction
that
to
it
seems
the
most
desirable
of
earthly
honours
that
mary
mesurier
loved
poetry
and
james
mesurier
sermons
in
face
of
the
fact
that
so
many
mothers
and
fathers
have
done
the
same
with
no
such
result
hardly
seems
adequate
to
account
for
the
peculiar
glamour
which
almost
before
he
could
read
there
was
for
henry
mesurier
in
any
form
of
print
while
books
were
still
being
read
to
him
there
had
already
come
into
his
mind
unaccountably
as
by
outside
suggestion
that
there
could
be
nothing
so
splendid
in
the
world
as
to
write
a
book
for
one
self
to
be
either
a
soldier
a
sailor
an
architect
or
an
engineer
would
doubtless
have
its
fascinations
as
well
but
to
make
a
real
printed
book
with
your
name
in
gilt
letters
outside
was
real
romance
at
that
early
day
and
for
a
long
while
after
the
boy
had
no
preference
for
any
particular
kind
of
book
it
was
an
entirely
abstract
passion
for
print
and
paper
to
have
been
the
author
of
the
iliad
or
of
book
of
household
recipes
would
have
given
him
almost
the
same
exaltation
of
authorship
and
the
thrill
of
worship
which
came
over
him
when
one
early
day
a
man
who
had
actually
had
an
article
on
the
sugar
bounties
accepted
by
a
commercial
magazine
was
pointed
out
to
him
in
the
street
was
one
he
never
forgot
nor
in
after
years
did
he
ever
encounter
that
transfigured
contributor
without
an
involuntary
recurrence
of
that
old
feeling
of
awe
no
subsequent
acquaintance
with
editorial
rooms
ever
led
him
into
materialistic
explanations
of
that
enchanted
piece
of
work
a
newspaper
the
editors
might
do
their
best
and
succeed
surprisingly
in
looking
like
ordinary
mortals
you
might
even
know
the
and
with
the
very
public
gaze
through
gratings
into
the
subterranean
the
mystery
none
the
less
remained
no
exposure
of
editorial
staffs
or
other
machinery
could
destroy
the
sense
of
enchantment
as
no
amount
of
anatomy
or
biology
can
destroy
the
mystery
of
the
human
miracle
so
i
suppose
nature
first
makes
us
in
love
with
the
tools
we
are
to
use
long
before
we
have
a
thought
upon
what
we
shall
use
them
perhaps
the
first
desire
of
the
born
writer
is
to
be
a
compositor
out
of
the
love
of
mere
type
quickly
evolves
a
love
of
mere
words
for
their
own
sake
but
whether
we
shall
make
use
of
them
as
a
historian
novelist
philosopher
or
poet
is
a
secondary
consideration
a
mere
afterthought
to
henry
mesurier
had
already
come
the
time
when
the
face
of
life
began
to
wear
a
certain
aspect
the
peculiar
attraction
of
which
for
himself
he
longed
to
fix
a
certain
mystical
importance
attaching
to
the
commonest
objects
and
circumstances
a
certain
ecstatic
quality
in
the
simplest
experiences
but
even
so
far
as
it
had
been
revealed
this
dawning
vision
of
the
world
seemed
only
to
have
come
to
him
not
so
much
to
find
expression
as
to
mock
him
with
his
childish
incapacity
adequately
to
use
the
very
tools
he
loved
he
would
hang
for
hours
over
some
scene
in
nature
caught
in
a
woodland
spell
like
a
nympholept
of
old
but
when
he
tried
to
put
in
words
what
he
had
seen
what
a
poor
piece
of
ornamental
gardening
the
thing
was
there
were
trees
and
birds
and
grass
to
be
sure
but
there
was
nothing
of
that
meaning
look
which
they
had
worn
that
look
of
being
tiptoe
with
revelation
which
is
one
of
the
most
fascinating
tricks
of
the
visible
world
and
which
even
a
harsh
town
full
of
chimneys
can
sometimes
take
on
when
seen
in
given
moments
and
lights
and
it
was
astonishing
to
see
into
what
lifeless
imitative
verse
his
most
original
and
passionate
moments
could
be
transformed
still
some
unreasonably
indulgent
spirit
of
the
air
that
had
evidently
not
read
his
manuscripts
whispered
him
to
be
of
good
cheer
the
lifeless
words
would
not
always
be
lifeless
some
day
the
birds
would
sing
in
his
verses
too
this
sense
of
failure
did
not
it
must
be
said
immediately
follow
composition
for
for
a
little
while
the
original
expression
of
the
thing
seen
reinforced
with
reflected
significance
its
pale
copy
it
was
only
some
weeks
after
when
the
written
copy
was
left
to
do
all
the
work
itself
that
its
foolish
inadequacy
was
exposed
however
there
is
one
consolation
they
are
not
worse
than
keats
and
shelley
wrote
at
the
same
age
he
said
to
himself
as
he
looked
through
a
bundle
of
the
poor
things
the
evening
before
his
room
was
to
be
dismantled
indeed
they
could
be
he
added
with
a
smile
fortunately
he
was
but
nineteen
as
yet
would
he
venture
on
a
like
comparison
were
he
yes
his
little
room
was
to
be
dismantled
on
the
morrow
this
first
little
private
chapel
of
his
spirit
this
fair
order
of
shelves
this
external
harmony
answering
to
an
inner
harmony
of
his
spirit
were
to
be
broken
up
for
ever
often
as
he
had
sat
in
the
folioed
lamplit
nook
which
was
as
it
were
the
very
chancel
of
the
little
church
and
gazed
in
an
ecstasy
at
the
books
each
with
a
great
shining
name
of
fame
upon
its
cover
it
had
seemed
as
though
he
had
put
his
very
soul
outside
him
externalised
it
in
this
little
corner
of
books
and
pictures
his
soul
shivered
as
one
who
must
go
houseless
awhile
at
the
thought
that
its
home
would
be
no
more
when
and
how
would
be
its
reincarnation
more
magnificent
maybe
but
never
this
again
it
was
sacrilege
was
it
not
ingratitude
too
when
once
more
the
books
and
the
pictures
began
to
form
into
a
new
harmony
there
would
be
no
love
to
help
the
work
go
on
but
as
he
mused
in
this
no
doubt
sentimental
fashion
the
door
opened
and
the
little
mike
entered
his
was
a
little
flibbertigibbet
of
a
face
already
lined
with
the
practice
of
mimicry
and
there
was
in
it
a
very
attractive
blending
of
tenderness
and
humour
mike
was
also
one
of
those
whom
life
at
the
beginning
had
impressed
with
the
delight
of
one
kind
of
work
and
no
other
when
a
mere
imp
of
a
boy
the
heartless
tormentor
of
a
large
and
sententious
stepmother
the
despair
of
schoolmasters
the
most
ingenious
of
truants
a
humorous
ragamuffin
invulnerable
to
punishment
it
was
already
revealed
to
him
that
his
mission
in
life
was
to
be
the
observation
and
reproduction
of
human
character
particularly
in
its
humorous
aspects
to
this
end
nature
had
gifted
him
with
a
face
that
was
capable
of
every
form
of
transformation
and
at
an
early
age
he
hastened
to
put
it
in
training
all
day
long
he
was
pulling
faces
as
an
artist
will
sketch
everything
he
comes
across
so
mike
would
endeavour
to
imitate
any
characteristic
expression
or
attitude
animate
or
inanimate
in
the
world
around
him
dogs
little
boys
and
grotesque
old
men
were
his
special
delight
and
of
all
his
elders
he
had
it
goes
without
saying
a
private
gallery
of
irreverently
faithful
portraits
in
addition
to
his
plastic
face
nature
had
given
him
a
larynx
which
was
capable
of
imitating
every
human
and
inhuman
sound
to
squeak
like
a
pig
bark
like
a
dog
low
like
a
cow
and
crow
like
a
cock
were
the
veriest
juvenilia
of
his
attainments
and
he
could
imitate
the
buzzing
of
a
fly
so
cunningly
that
flies
themselves
have
often
been
deceived
it
was
this
delight
in
imitation
for
its
own
sake
and
not
so
much
that
he
had
been
caught
by
the
usual
allurements
of
the
theatre
that
he
looked
upon
the
career
of
an
actor
as
his
natural
and
ultimate
calling
it
was
already
privately
whispered
in
the
little
circle
that
mike
would
some
day
go
on
the
stage
but
do
tell
that
as
yet
to
old
laflin
whatever
you
do
there
was
a
good
deal
more
in
mike
than
pulling
faces
as
esther
recently
and
henry
before
her
had
discovered
his
acting
was
some
day
to
stir
the
hearts
of
audiences
because
he
had
instincts
for
knowing
human
nature
inside
as
well
as
out
knew
the
secret
springs
of
tears
as
well
as
the
open
secrets
of
laughter
and
it
was
rather
on
this
common
ground
of
a
rich
humanity
that
these
two
had
met
and
become
friends
rather
than
on
any
real
community
of
tastes
and
ideas
yet
mike
loved
books
too
and
had
an
excellent
taste
in
them
though
perhaps
he
had
hardly
loved
them
had
not
henry
and
esther
loved
them
first
and
it
is
quite
certain
and
quite
proper
that
he
never
found
a
page
of
any
book
so
fascinating
as
the
face
of
some
lined
and
battered
human
being
over
that
writing
he
was
never
found
asleep
there
was
one
other
literary
matter
on
which
he
held
a
very
personal
and
unshakable
opinion
henry
mesurier
future
as
a
poet
and
on
this
he
came
just
in
the
nick
of
time
to
cheer
him
this
evening
the
next
move
will
be
to
london
old
fellow
he
said
and
then
soon
see
my
prophecies
come
true
my
opinion
may
be
worth
much
but
you
know
what
it
is
you
be
a
great
writer
some
day
never
fear
thank
you
dear
old
boy
and
you
know
what
i
think
about
your
acting
do
you
then
it
was
that
esther
appeared
and
henry
made
some
transparent
excuse
to
leave
them
awhile
together
you
dear
old
thing
said
esther
kissing
him
now
do
stay
away
too
long
chapter
v
of
the
love
of
esther
and
mike
and
the
mesurier
law
in
regard
to
sweethearts
i
afraid
esther
was
little
more
than
fourteen
when
she
had
first
seen
and
fallen
in
love
with
mike
she
had
heard
much
of
him
from
her
brother
but
for
one
reason
or
another
he
had
never
been
to
the
house
one
evening
however
at
a
concert
henry
had
told
her
to
look
in
a
certain
direction
and
she
would
see
mike
i
do
suppose
you
call
him
good
looking
he
said
so
esther
had
looked
round
and
seen
the
pretty
curly
red
hair
and
the
eager
little
wistful
humorous
face
for
the
first
time
why
he
got
a
lovely
little
face
she
said
blushing
deeply
for
no
reason
at
all
except
perhaps
that
there
had
seemed
something
pleading
and
in
that
little
face
something
that
cried
out
to
be
mothered
and
that
instantly
there
had
welled
up
in
her
heart
a
great
warm
wish
that
some
day
she
might
be
that
for
it
and
more
and
at
the
same
instant
it
had
occurred
to
the
boy
that
the
face
thus
turned
to
him
for
a
moment
was
the
loveliest
face
he
had
ever
seen
the
only
lovely
face
he
would
ever
care
to
see
but
with
that
thought
too
had
come
a
curious
pang
of
hopelessness
into
his
heart
for
esther
mesurier
was
one
of
those
girls
who
are
the
prizes
of
men
with
all
those
pretty
tall
fellows
about
her
it
was
unlikely
indeed
that
she
would
care
for
a
little
ragamuffin
like
him
and
yet
if
she
never
could
care
for
him
never
never
at
all
what
a
lonely
place
the
world
would
be
when
after
the
concert
henry
looked
round
to
introduce
mike
to
his
sister
he
had
somehow
slipped
away
and
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
however
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
mike
paid
a
visit
to
study
one
evening
and
coming
ostensibly
to
look
at
his
books
once
more
saw
his
sister
and
spoke
to
her
a
brief
introductory
word
his
interest
in
literature
became
positively
remarkable
from
this
time
and
the
enthusiasm
with
which
his
actor
mind
reflected
and
no
doubt
in
all
good
faith
mimicked
the
various
philosophical
and
literary
enthusiasms
of
his
friend
was
though
neither
realised
it
a
sure
earnest
of
his
future
more
and
more
frequent
visits
to
that
study
became
necessary
for
its
gratification
and
in
the
course
of
one
of
them
mike
confessed
to
henry
that
he
loved
his
sister
previously
piling
upon
himself
many
anticipatory
terms
of
ignominy
for
daring
to
do
so
presumptuous
a
thing
henry
however
was
so
taken
with
the
idea
that
in
his
singleness
of
mind
he
suffered
no
pang
of
retrospective
suspicion
of
his
friend
love
for
himself
pending
decision
and
of
her
mind
in
the
matter
he
had
something
more
than
a
glimmering
he
welcomed
mike
with
gladness
as
a
prospective
and
as
soon
as
he
found
an
opportunity
left
them
alone
together
returning
quite
a
long
time
afterwards
to
find
them
extraordinarily
happy
it
would
appear
at
his
safe
return
esther
and
mike
had
thus
been
fortunate
enough
to
get
that
important
question
of
a
mate
settled
quite
early
in
life
and
to
be
saved
from
those
arduous
and
desolating
experiments
in
being
fitted
with
a
heart
which
so
many
less
happy
people
have
to
go
through
but
this
happy
fact
was
as
yet
a
secret
beyond
this
strict
circle
of
three
for
strange
as
it
may
sound
the
beautiful
attraction
of
a
girl
for
a
boy
the
beautiful
worship
of
a
boy
for
a
girl
were
matters
not
even
mentionable
as
yet
in
the
mesurier
household
for
a
child
particularly
a
girl
under
twenty
to
speak
of
having
a
sweetheart
was
an
offence
which
had
a
strong
savour
of
disgust
in
it
even
for
mesurier
as
in
most
matters
she
was
so
far
as
the
only
decent
theory
of
the
relations
of
the
sexes
was
involuntarily
explicit
by
virtue
of
certain
explosions
on
the
subject
it
was
something
like
this
that
at
a
certain
age
say
or
for
leniency
twenty
as
it
were
on
the
striking
of
a
clock
the
young
girl
who
previously
had
been
profoundly
and
inexpressibly
unconscious
that
the
male
being
existed
would
suddenly
sit
up
wide
awake
in
an
attitude
of
attention
to
offers
of
marriage
and
that
similarly
the
young
man
who
had
meanwhile
lived
with
his
eyes
shut
and
his
senses
asleep
would
jump
up
also
at
the
striking
of
a
clock
and
as
it
were
with
hilarity
say
it
is
high
time
i
chose
a
wife
and
thereupon
begin
to
look
about
among
the
streets
and
known
to
him
for
that
impossible
paragon
a
wife
to
satisfy
both
his
parents
one
or
two
of
henry
earliest
troubles
and
most
drastic
punishments
had
come
of
a
propensity
to
sweethearts
developed
at
an
indecorously
early
age
and
in
fact
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
he
could
barely
recall
the
name
of
miss
this
or
miss
the
other
by
the
association
of
ancient
physical
pangs
suffered
for
their
sake
the
greatest
danger
to
such
contraband
passions
was
undoubtedly
the
post
for
in
the
mesurier
household
a
more
than
russian
censorship
was
exercised
over
the
incoming
and
as
far
as
it
could
be
controlled
the
outgoing
mail
one
old
morning
at
family
breakfast
which
the
subsequent
events
of
the
evening
were
to
fix
on
his
mind
henry
mesurier
had
grown
white
with
fear
as
the
stupid
maid
had
handed
him
a
fat
letter
addressed
in
a
sprawling
hand
who
is
your
letter
from
henry
asked
the
father
henry
blushed
and
boggled
pass
it
over
to
me
resistance
was
worse
than
useless
as
in
a
woman
will
see
her
husband
set
up
against
a
wall
and
shot
before
her
face
as
a
conspirator
sees
the
hands
of
the
police
close
upon
papers
of
the
most
terrible
secrecy
so
did
henry
watch
that
scented
little
package
pass
with
a
sense
of
irrevocable
loss
into
the
cold
hands
of
his
father
the
father
opened
it
placed
a
little
white
enclosure
by
the
side
of
his
for
further
inspection
and
then
read
the
letter
full
of
darlings
and
for
evers
with
the
severe
attention
he
would
have
given
a
business
letter
then
he
handed
it
across
to
the
mother
without
a
word
but
with
the
look
one
doctor
gives
another
in
discovering
a
new
and
terrible
symptom
in
a
patient
on
whom
they
are
consulting
while
the
mother
read
the
father
opened
the
little
packet
and
out
rolled
a
tiny
plait
of
silky
brown
hair
tied
into
a
loop
with
a
blue
ribbon
disgusting
exclaimed
the
father
and
mother
simultaneously
to
each
other
as
though
the
boy
was
not
there
i
am
shocked
at
you
henry
said
the
mother
i
shall
certainly
write
to
the
forward
little
girl
parents
said
the
father
oh
do
do
that
father
exclaimed
the
boy
in
terror
and
half
wondering
if
so
sweet
a
thing
could
really
be
so
criminal
do
dare
to
speak
to
me
said
the
father
leave
the
i
will
see
you
again
this
evening
henry
knew
too
well
what
the
verb
to
see
signified
under
the
circumstances
and
the
day
passed
in
such
apprehensive
gloom
that
it
was
a
positive
relief
when
evening
had
at
last
come
to
feel
a
about
him
at
once
more
snaky
and
more
notched
than
any
previously
applied
to
his
stubborn
young
frame
not
to
cry
was
of
course
a
point
of
honour
and
as
the
infuriating
absence
of
tears
inflamed
the
righteous
anger
of
the
parent
the
stick
splintered
and
broke
with
a
crash
in
which
accident
henry
learned
he
was
responsible
for
a
double
offence
i
would
have
broken
that
stick
for
five
pounds
said
the
father
his
interest
suddenly
withdrawn
from
his
son
it
was
given
to
me
by
my
old
friend
tarporley
which
as
can
be
imagined
was
a
mighty
satisfaction
to
the
sad
small
soul
smarting
not
merely
from
the
stick
but
from
the
sense
that
life
held
something
stupid
in
its
injustice
in
that
he
was
thus
being
mauled
for
the
most
beautiful
exalted
feeling
that
had
ever
visited
his
young
heart
those
dark
ages
of
oppression
were
long
since
passed
for
henry
and
esther
when
mike
began
to
steal
in
of
an
evening
to
see
esther
and
they
were
only
referred
to
now
and
again
anecdotally
as
the
nineteenth
century
looks
back
at
the
days
of
the
holy
inquisition
but
still
it
was
wise
to
be
cautious
for
an
interdict
against
mike
coming
to
the
house
was
quite
within
possibility
even
in
this
comparatively
enlightened
epoch
and
that
would
have
been
even
more
effective
than
james
mesurier
old
friend
tarporley
stick
of
sacred
memory
chapter
vi
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
home
recalling
for
another
moment
or
two
the
ancient
affair
of
the
heart
described
in
the
last
chapter
it
may
pertinently
be
added
that
james
mesurier
fulfilled
his
threat
on
that
occasion
and
had
in
fact
written
to
the
forward
little
girl
parents
could
he
have
seen
the
rather
amused
reception
of
his
letter
he
would
have
realised
with
sorrow
that
an
age
of
parental
leniency
little
short
of
degeneration
was
in
certain
quarters
unmistakably
supplanting
the
stern
age
of
which
he
was
in
a
degree
an
anachronistic
survival
that
forward
little
parents
chanced
to
know
james
mesurier
enough
by
sight
and
reputation
to
respect
him
while
they
smiled
across
to
each
other
at
his
rather
quaint
disciplinarianism
could
henry
mesurier
have
seen
that
smile
he
would
not
only
have
felt
reassured
as
to
the
fate
of
his
little
sweetheart
but
have
understood
that
there
were
temperate
zones
of
childhood
as
well
as
arctic
when
young
life
waxed
gaily
to
the
sound
of
laughter
and
other
musical
accompaniments
this
revelation
however
was
deferred
some
few
years
till
he
became
acquainted
with
the
merry
family
of
which
mike
laflin
was
the
characteristic
expression
old
laflin
was
a
little
jolly
gentleman
bubbling
over
with
mirth
who
liked
to
have
young
people
about
him
and
in
his
quips
and
cranks
was
as
young
as
and
much
cleverer
than
any
of
them
it
almost
startled
henry
on
his
first
introduction
to
this
family
of
two
daughters
and
two
brothers
where
the
father
was
rather
like
a
brother
grown
prematurely
bald
and
the
stepmother
supplied
with
monumental
dignity
that
element
of
solemnity
without
which
no
properly
regulated
household
is
complete
to
notice
the
which
prevailed
amongst
them
all
jokes
were
flying
about
from
one
to
another
all
the
time
and
the
father
made
a
point
of
capping
them
all
this
was
home
in
a
liberal
sense
which
the
word
had
never
meant
to
henry
doubtless
it
had
its
own
individual
restrictions
and
censorships
but
its
surface
was
at
all
events
debonair
and
it
was
serviceable
to
henry
as
revealing
the
existence
of
more
genial
social
climates
than
that
in
which
he
had
been
nurtured
though
in
making
the
comparison
with
his
own
atmosphere
he
realised
that
this
was
nothing
more
important
than
a
grace
perhaps
nay
very
surely
the
seriousness
even
the
severity
of
his
own
training
had
been
among
the
very
conditions
needed
to
make
him
what
he
some
day
hoped
to
be
though
they
had
seemed
so
purposely
inimical
had
james
mesurier
religion
been
more
free
and
easy
a
matter
less
personally
assured
and
momentous
his
son
almost
oppressive
sense
of
the
spiritual
significance
of
existence
had
been
less
radiant
and
constantly
supporting
life
might
have
gained
in
superficial
liveableness
but
it
would
have
lost
in
intensity
in
real
importance
and
with
that
loss
would
have
gone
too
henry
chance
of
being
a
poet
the
poet
in
a
golden
clime
was
born
once
and
again
maybe
but
more
often
he
comes
from
a
land
of
iron
and
tears
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
that
henry
should
begin
to
appreciate
the
services
of
his
home
to
his
development
at
the
moment
when
he
was
leaving
it
and
the
mere
pang
of
the
parting
from
it
when
one
day
the
hour
for
parting
had
surely
come
was
much
more
deep
and
complicated
than
he
could
have
dreamed
as
in
our
bodies
we
become
conscious
of
certain
vital
centres
certain
dependencies
of
relation
and
harmony
only
when
they
have
suffered
shock
so
often
in
life
we
may
go
along
unconscious
of
the
vital
dependencies
of
our
human
relationships
till
the
moment
comes
to
strain
or
sever
them
then
a
thousand
hidden
nerves
quiver
at
the
discovering
touch
of
the
knife
henry
leaving
home
though
it
had
been
originally
the
suggestion
of
violent
feeling
was
not
to
be
an
actual
severance
his
father
leave
my
house
for
ever
had
owed
something
to
the
rhetoric
of
anger
and
the
expulsion
and
cutting
off
which
it
had
implied
had
since
been
so
softened
as
practically
to
have
disappeared
henry
was
certainly
not
leaving
his
father
house
for
ever
but
merely
going
into
lodgings
with
a
friend
with
full
privileges
to
visit
his
own
home
as
often
as
he
chose
still
he
was
all
the
same
leaving
home
and
he
was
the
first
to
leave
it
the
mother
at
all
events
knew
that
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
knew
that
with
her
departure
desertion
she
may
have
called
it
a
new
era
had
commenced
for
the
home
the
era
of
disintegration
for
twenty
years
and
more
it
had
been
all
building
and
building
now
it
would
be
all
just
pulling
down
again
and
there
was
a
dreary
sound
as
of
demolition
and
rain
in
her
ears
oh
tragic
love
of
mothers
of
no
love
is
the
final
loss
and
doom
so
inevitably
destined
the
husband
may
desert
the
wife
but
the
son
is
sure
to
desert
his
mother
must
for
nature
demands
the
desertion
put
not
your
trust
in
princes
and
yet
put
it
rather
in
princes
oh
fond
and
doting
parents
than
in
the
flower
of
childhood
for
which
year
after
year
with
labours
infinite
you
would
buy
all
the
sunshine
of
the
world
henry
pang
at
leaving
home
was
mainly
the
pang
of
parting
with
his
mother
it
seemed
more
than
a
mere
physical
parting
it
was
his
childhood
that
was
parting
from
her
for
ever
when
he
came
to
see
them
he
would
be
something
different
a
man
an
independent
being
as
long
ago
physically
now
spiritually
the
umbilical
cord
had
been
cut
with
esther
and
dot
and
mat
the
parting
was
hardly
a
parting
as
it
was
rather
a
promise
of
their
all
meeting
together
some
day
in
a
new
place
of
freedom
which
there
was
a
sense
of
his
going
out
to
prepare
for
them
their
way
would
be
his
way
as
the
mother
could
not
for
theirs
was
the
highway
of
youth
which
sooner
or
later
they
would
all
take
together
singing
in
the
morning
sun
the
three
younger
sisters
the
as
yet
unopened
buds
of
the
family
flower
took
henry
departure
with
the
surface
tears
and
the
central
indifference
of
childhood
when
a
family
is
so
large
it
practically
includes
two
generations
in
itself
and
these
three
girls
were
really
to
prove
a
generation
so
different
in
characteristics
from
their
four
elders
as
to
demand
a
separate
chronicle
to
themselves
thus
as
henry
drove
away
amid
his
trunks
from
the
home
of
his
father
genealogical
poverty
denies
us
the
romantic
grandiloquence
of
the
plural
it
was
his
mother
farewell
arms
and
farewell
tears
and
his
farewell
promises
to
her
of
which
he
was
mainly
conscious
he
had
promised
to
take
care
of
himself
and
particularly
to
beware
of
damp
sheets
and
then
he
too
had
burst
into
tears
indeed
it
was
generally
a
tearful
business
after
which
everybody
was
glad
to
retire
into
corners
to
subside
privately
and
dry
themselves
henry
crouched
in
the
corner
of
his
cab
with
fully
half
his
cry
to
finish
out
and
curiously
all
the
time
a
sad
little
story
from
an
old
holiday
in
the
country
kept
haunting
him
it
was
at
once
a
fact
and
a
fable
concerning
a
happy
little
family
of
swallows
whose
sudden
tragedy
he
had
seen
with
his
own
boyish
pitying
eyes
in
a
little
vinery
attached
to
an
old
country
house
which
the
mesuriers
had
rented
for
a
month
or
so
for
certain
successive
summers
two
swallows
had
built
their
nest
and
in
due
course
there
were
three
young
swallows
to
keep
them
company
it
was
understood
that
the
door
of
the
vinery
must
be
left
open
that
the
parent
swallows
might
fly
to
and
fro
for
food
but
by
some
accident
it
chanced
that
the
door
was
one
day
closed
and
the
vinery
not
visited
again
for
several
days
when
at
last
the
door
was
opened
again
the
sight
that
met
young
eyes
was
one
henry
had
never
forgotten
three
little
starved
swallows
hardly
bigger
than
butterflies
lay
upon
the
floor
and
from
the
nest
above
hung
the
long
with
which
the
parents
had
vainly
sought
to
anchor
them
safely
to
the
home
but
still
sadder
details
were
forthcoming
when
the
children
who
had
been
wondering
what
had
become
of
the
parents
had
suddenly
discovered
their
wasted
bodies
in
the
grass
a
yard
or
two
away
from
the
vinery
door
a
few
days
ago
this
had
been
a
happy
thriving
home
and
now
it
was
absolutely
desolated
done
away
with
for
ever
it
needed
no
exceptional
imagination
or
sympathy
to
conceive
the
agonised
longing
of
the
parents
as
they
had
dashed
themselves
again
and
again
upon
that
cruel
unyielding
door
hearing
the
piteous
cries
of
their
young
ones
within
and
the
anguish
in
which
their
exhausted
little
lives
had
at
last
gone
out
the
young
swallows
had
died
for
lack
of
food
but
the
old
ones
had
died
for
love
had
some
other
hand
brought
them
food
would
the
young
ones
have
missed
the
old
ones
like
that
chapter
vii
a
link
with
civilisation
on
the
afternoon
following
henry
departure
esther
went
out
for
a
walk
and
she
came
presently
to
a
pretty
little
house
half
hidden
in
its
big
garden
a
lawn
richly
bathed
in
sunlight
flashed
through
the
trees
and
opening
the
gate
and
following
the
path
along
one
side
of
the
house
esther
presently
mounted
to
a
small
terrace
where
as
she
had
hoped
she
came
upon
a
dainty
little
lady
watering
her
flowers
why
esther
it
you
how
sweet
of
you
i
was
just
dying
to
see
you
exclaimed
the
little
lady
turning
a
pretty
but
somewhat
worn
and
brilliantly
sad
face
from
her
gardening
just
let
me
finish
this
thirsty
bed
and
then
you
must
give
me
a
kiss
there
then
the
two
embraced
and
as
myrtilla
williamson
held
esther
at
arm
length
and
looked
at
her
admiringly
how
pretty
you
look
she
exclaimed
generously
that
new
hat
a
great
success
did
i
tell
you
mauve
was
your
colour
turn
round
yes
dear
you
look
charming
where
in
the
world
i
wonder
did
you
all
get
that
grand
look
of
yours
from
i
do
mean
your
good
looks
merely
but
that
look
of
distinction
your
father
and
mother
have
it
too
but
where
did
get
it
from
you
a
all
of
you
but
would
you
like
a
cup
of
tea
come
in
and
she
led
the
way
indoors
to
a
tiny
boudoir
on
the
left
of
the
hall
of
which
a
dainty
glimpse
with
its
books
and
and
bibelots
was
to
be
caught
from
the
terrace
everything
about
myrtilla
williamson
was
scrupulously
determinedly
dainty
from
the
flowered
about
her
slim
girlish
figure
her
predilection
for
that
then
novel
and
suspected
garment
was
regarded
as
a
sure
mark
of
a
certain
parisian
levity
by
her
neighbours
to
her
just
a
little
precious
enunciation
in
france
in
the
seventeenth
century
she
would
almost
certainly
have
been
a
visitor
at
the
hotel
rambouillet
and
she
was
mysteriously
and
disapprovingly
spoken
of
as
aesthetic
she
had
a
look
as
if
she
had
tripped
out
of
a
japanese
fan
and
slept
at
night
in
a
jar
and
she
had
brains
those
good
things
brains
her
name
was
very
like
her
life
of
which
might
be
described
as
myrtilla
the
other
half
as
williamson
she
was
myrtilla
during
the
day
dabbling
with
her
her
flowers
or
her
books
but
at
six
each
afternoon
with
the
sound
of
aggressive
masculine
boots
in
the
hall
her
life
suddenly
changed
with
a
sigh
to
williamson
the
williamson
half
of
her
life
was
so
clumsily
so
grotesquely
with
the
myrtilla
half
that
it
was
and
probably
will
always
remain
a
mystery
why
she
had
ever
attempted
so
tasteless
and
inconvenient
an
addition
a
mystery
however
far
from
unique
in
the
history
of
those
mysteriously
stupid
unhappy
marriages
with
evident
boors
which
refined
and
charming
women
will
it
is
to
be
feared
go
on
making
to
the
end
of
the
human
chapter
it
was
perhaps
a
day
hardly
less
interesting
for
myrtilla
than
for
the
young
people
themselves
when
she
had
first
met
henry
and
esther
mesurier
before
in
the
dull
bourgeois
society
into
which
williamson
had
transplanted
her
from
london
she
had
found
none
with
whom
she
dared
be
her
natural
myrtilla
there
she
was
expected
to
be
williamson
to
the
bone
henry
and
esther
however
were
only
too
grateful
for
myrtilla
through
whom
was
to
come
to
them
the
revelation
of
some
minor
graces
of
life
for
which
they
had
the
instincts
but
on
which
they
had
lacked
instruction
and
who
still
more
important
at
least
for
henry
was
to
be
their
first
fragile
link
with
certain
strenuous
new
northern
writers
translations
of
whom
in
every
tongue
had
just
then
descended
gothlike
upon
europe
to
the
great
energising
of
its
various
literatures
she
it
was
too
who
first
handed
them
the
fretted
golden
key
to
the
enchanted
garden
of
the
and
the
striking
head
of
the
young
dante
in
sepia
which
had
hung
in
a
sort
of
in
henry
study
had
been
copied
for
him
from
rossetti
sketch
by
myrtilla
own
hand
she
had
too
one
of
the
most
precious
gifts
for
friendship
the
gift
of
unselfish
and
diligent
and
progressive
appreciation
of
all
a
good
points
she
never
flattered
but
she
never
missed
the
smallest
opportunity
for
praise
she
was
one
of
those
rare
people
who
make
you
feel
happy
in
yourself
who
send
you
away
somehow
dignified
profitably
raised
in
your
own
esteem
just
as
others
have
a
mysterious
power
of
dejecting
you
in
your
proudest
moments
if
you
had
any
charm
however
shy
myrtilla
williamson
would
find
it
and
send
you
away
with
a
great
gush
of
gratitude
to
her
because
it
had
been
found
at
last
this
was
perhaps
the
greatest
charm
of
her
clever
letters
they
were
all
about
you
not
of
course
that
you
did
want
to
hear
about
her
but
frequently
all
she
told
you
of
herself
was
her
name
perhaps
she
would
write
in
the
that
remained
between
say
a
visit
from
esther
and
the
arrival
of
williamson
to
fix
in
a
few
intimate
vivid
words
the
charm
of
their
afternoon
together
and
tell
esther
in
some
new
gratifying
way
what
she
was
to
her
and
why
and
how
she
was
it
or
when
henry
had
been
there
even
more
carefully
in
the
absence
of
williamson
to
read
her
his
new
poem
she
would
write
him
a
long
letter
of
literary
criticism
just
perceptibly
vibrating
with
the
emotion
she
might
have
felt
for
the
romantic
young
poet
whom
she
allowed
to
call
himself
her
cavaliere
servente
had
she
not
been
williamson
as
well
as
myrtilla
and
had
she
not
as
she
somewhat
unscientifically
declared
been
old
enough
to
be
his
mother
well
she
said
as
they
sipped
their
tea
so
henry
really
gone
he
slipped
round
to
bid
me
a
sort
of
yesterday
and
told
me
the
whole
story
on
the
whole
i
glad
though
i
know
how
you
miss
each
other
but
i
sorriest
for
your
mother
yes
yes
i
sorry
for
her
you
must
try
to
make
it
up
to
her
dear
child
i
think
just
that
above
all
things
would
make
me
fear
to
be
a
mother
one
can
do
without
children
and
there
was
a
certain
implication
in
the
conversational
atmosphere
that
children
of
the
name
of
williamson
had
been
mercifully
spared
the
world
but
when
once
they
have
come
into
one
life
it
must
be
terrible
to
see
them
go
out
again
i
should
like
to
come
round
and
have
a
little
talk
with
your
mother
i
wonder
if
she
care
to
see
me
so
long
as
you
do
come
in
your
said
esther
with
a
laugh
cruel
child
and
then
with
a
way
she
had
of
suddenly
finding
something
she
wanted
to
hear
of
among
the
interests
of
her
friends
now
she
said
tell
me
something
about
mike
i
suppose
the
course
of
true
love
runs
as
smoothly
as
ever
happy
children
give
him
my
love
when
you
see
him
wo
you
esther
told
all
there
was
to
tell
about
mike
and
wished
she
could
have
repaid
her
friend
sympathetic
interest
with
a
request
for
something
similar
about
williamson
but
it
was
tacitly
understood
that
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
said
on
that
subject
and
that
the
news
of
myrtilla
life
could
hardly
again
take
any
more
excitingly
personal
form
than
the
excitements
of
art
or
literature
though
indeed
art
and
literature
were
to
be
just
to
them
far
more
than
in
the
life
of
myrtilla
williamson
they
were
indeed
it
was
easy
to
see
a
very
sustaining
religion
for
the
lonely
little
woman
who
having
no
children
to
study
and
having
completed
her
studies
of
williamson
was
driven
a
good
deal
upon
the
study
and
development
of
herself
the
williamson
half
of
the
day
provided
her
fully
with
opportunities
for
the
practice
of
all
the
philosophy
she
was
likely
to
acquire
from
writers
ancient
and
modern
and
for
the
absorption
of
all
the
consolation
history
and
biography
was
likely
to
afford
in
the
stories
of
women
similarly
circumstanced
it
is
to
be
feared
that
myrtilla
not
only
wore
in
advance
of
her
time
but
was
also
somewhat
prematurely
something
of
a
new
woman
but
this
was
a
subject
on
which
she
really
did
very
little
to
poison
esther
young
mind
esther
young
mind
in
common
with
those
of
her
two
subsequent
sisters
was
little
in
need
of
poisoning
from
outside
on
such
subjects
indeed
it
was
a
curious
phenomenon
to
observe
how
all
these
young
minds
sprung
from
a
stock
of
such
ancient
unquestioning
faith
had
so
to
say
been
born
poisoned
or
to
state
the
matter
less
metaphorically
had
all
been
born
with
instincts
for
the
most
pitiless
and
effortless
reasoning
on
all
subjects
human
and
divine
as
the
hour
approached
when
poor
myrtilla
must
change
back
to
williamson
esther
rose
to
say
come
again
soon
dear
girl
you
do
know
the
good
you
do
me
the
good
dear
woman
was
entirely
done
by
her
unwearied
sympathetic
discussion
of
the
affairs
and
dreams
of
esther
mike
and
henry
oh
here
is
a
wonderful
new
book
i
intended
to
talk
to
you
about
you
can
take
it
with
you
i
have
finished
it
come
next
week
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
as
esther
walked
down
the
path
myrtilla
watched
her
and
as
she
passed
out
of
the
gate
waved
her
a
final
kiss
of
parting
and
turned
indoors
there
seemed
something
ever
so
sad
about
her
dainty
back
as
it
disappeared
into
the
doorway
poor
little
woman
said
esther
to
herself
as
she
looked
to
see
the
title
of
the
book
she
was
carrying
it
included
a
curious
russian
name
the
correct
pronunciation
of
which
she
foresaw
she
must
ask
myrtilla
on
their
next
meeting
it
was
the
journal
of
marie
bashkirtseff
chapter
viii
a
rhapsody
of
tyre
sidon
the
stage
of
the
moving
events
so
far
recorded
though
it
makes
much
of
possessing
a
separate
importance
is
really
a
residential
suburb
of
tyre
the
great
seaport
in
which
all
the
ships
of
the
world
come
to
and
fro
during
the
day
sidon
is
virtually
emptied
of
its
and
is
given
up
to
perambulators
and
feminine
activities
generally
for
the
men
have
streamed
across
the
ferries
that
bridge
the
sunny
boisterous
river
to
the
docks
and
offices
of
tyre
though
tyre
is
not
a
very
old
city
it
is
not
so
new
as
to
be
denied
a
few
of
those
associations
known
as
historical
tyre
had
once
the
honour
to
be
taken
by
prince
rupert
and
long
before
that
its
nucleus
had
existed
as
a
monk
ferry
by
which
travellers
were
rowed
across
the
river
to
the
monastery
and
at
sidon
sometimes
of
an
evening
henry
and
mike
would
think
of
those
times
as
they
looked
over
the
at
the
long
lines
of
river
lights
with
their
restless
heaving
reflections
and
sometimes
they
could
picture
to
themselves
the
green
sloping
banks
of
the
virgin
fields
and
hear
the
priory
bell
calling
to
them
out
of
the
darkness
but
such
were
the
faintest
of
their
visions
and
they
loved
the
river
banks
best
as
they
are
with
their
egyptian
walls
and
swarming
lights
and
tangled
ships
and
whoso
should
think
that
that
sordid
commercial
city
given
up
to
all
the
prose
of
trade
day
by
day
is
not
a
poet
at
heart
has
never
seen
her
strange
smile
at
evening
when
the
shops
are
shut
and
the
offices
empty
and
the
men
who
know
her
not
gone
home
for
then
across
the
crowded
roofs
softly
comes
a
strange
sweetness
and
deep
down
among
the
gloomy
wynds
of
deserted
warehouses
still
as
temples
sudden
fairies
of
sunset
dance
and
dazzle
and
touch
the
grimy
walls
with
soft
hands
in
lonely
back
rooms
full
of
desks
and
dust
haunted
lights
of
evening
stand
like
splendid
apparitions
and
sometimes
if
you
lingered
at
the
top
of
high
street
beneath
the
dark
old
church
and
the
moon
was
out
on
the
left
of
the
steeple
and
the
sunset
dying
on
the
right
dying
beyond
the
tangled
masts
and
fading
from
the
river
you
would
forget
you
were
a
city
clerk
and
you
would
wonder
why
the
world
was
so
beautiful
why
the
moon
was
made
of
pearl
and
what
it
was
that
called
to
you
out
of
yonder
golden
sea
and
your
heart
would
fill
with
a
strange
gladness
and
you
would
call
back
to
those
unearthly
voices
i
am
yours
yours
all
yours
thus
would
this
town
of
bales
and
merchants
of
and
stools
make
poets
at
evening
that
she
might
stone
them
at
noon
for
of
course
she
would
have
forgotten
it
all
in
the
morning
and
it
were
well
not
to
remind
her
with
your
dreaming
eyes
of
her
last
night
softness
she
will
look
back
at
you
with
stony
misunderstanding
and
her
new
lover
reality
will
sharply
box
your
ears
it
is
no
use
reminding
the
exchange
that
it
looked
like
a
scene
from
romeo
and
juliet
in
the
moonlight
it
dare
not
admit
it
but
wait
patiently
till
the
evening
tyre
will
be
yours
again
with
the
sunset
she
pretends
all
day
that
it
is
the
mayor
in
the
gilded
coach
and
the
pursy
merchantmen
she
cares
for
but
it
is
really
you
a
poor
shabby
poet
she
loves
all
the
time
for
you
only
does
she
wear
her
gauzy
silks
at
evening
chapter
ix
a
penitentiary
of
the
mathematics
yes
mike
was
some
day
to
be
another
kean
and
henry
was
to
prove
a
serious
rival
to
shakespeare
but
meanwhile
they
were
clerks
in
the
offices
of
tyre
of
the
rigours
and
therefore
too
the
truancies
and
humours
of
the
lot
official
mike
was
comparatively
so
comfortably
circumstanced
as
to
have
little
knowledge
his
father
was
the
king
of
a
little
flourishing
prison
of
desks
and
mike
was
one
of
the
consequently
his
lot
though
dull
was
seldom
bitter
and
many
mitigations
of
it
were
within
his
privilege
with
henry
it
was
different
he
was
a
humble
unit
among
twenty
other
slaves
chained
to
that
modern
substitute
for
the
galleys
the
desk
and
in
a
wicked
bargain
he
had
contracted
to
give
his
from
nine
in
the
morning
till
six
in
the
evening
for
sixty
pounds
a
year
with
an
occasional
rise
which
after
thirty
service
might
end
in
your
having
reached
a
proud
annual
three
hundred
for
the
rest
of
your
maimed
and
narrowed
days
henry
had
come
to
the
office
straight
from
school
at
the
age
of
sixteen
and
though
classrooms
breathe
an
air
sufficiently
frigid
and
suggestive
of
inhuman
interests
and
unmeaning
discipline
the
icy
air
of
that
office
had
at
first
almost
taken
his
breath
the
place
was
so
ridiculously
serious
there
might
conceivedly
be
interests
in
the
world
worthy
of
so
abject
an
absorption
so
bleaching
an
obeisance
of
the
individual
but
henry
with
the
dews
of
certain
classics
still
upon
him
remembered
that
anything
really
olympian
in
its
importance
is
always
strong
enough
to
smile
it
is
a
lesser
strength
that
must
make
the
muscular
effort
of
severity
true
dignities
as
often
as
possible
stand
at
ease
but
here
indeed
were
no
true
strengths
and
dignities
only
and
here
the
majesties
the
occupations
the
offences
were
alike
frivolities
fantastically
changed
about
into
solemnities
that
first
impression
of
abject
bowed
heads
and
chains
rattled
beneath
desks
was
roughly
correct
for
all
that
was
human
in
a
man
this
was
a
prison
these
men
who
bent
over
foolish
papers
were
evidently
convicts
of
the
most
desperate
character
so
at
all
events
you
would
judge
when
occasionally
one
or
other
of
the
known
as
partners
passed
among
them
with
the
lash
of
his
eye
such
faint
human
twittering
as
may
have
grown
up
amongst
even
these
poor
exiles
would
suddenly
die
into
a
silence
white
with
fear
as
when
the
shadow
of
a
hawk
falls
across
the
song
of
smaller
birds
no
human
relations
are
acknowledged
here
outside
you
may
be
a
husband
wonderfully
beloved
and
tragically
important
you
may
be
a
man
whose
courage
has
your
brave
breast
you
may
be
a
passionate
and
subtle
musician
in
your
private
hours
you
may
even
on
sundays
be
a
much
appreciated
vessel
of
the
divine
but
all
such
distinctions
are
not
current
here
here
they
are
foreign
coin
diplomas
unacknowledged
in
this
barbarous
realm
of
ink
and
steel
the
more
ignorant
the
more
narrow
the
more
mean
the
more
unnatural
you
can
contrive
to
be
the
better
will
be
your
lot
in
this
sad
monastery
of
mammon
when
the
door
hissed
behind
you
with
that
little
patent
pneumatic
device
you
ceased
to
be
a
human
being
and
began
to
be
the
human
machine
all
the
vitality
you
have
stored
within
that
pale
body
you
are
expected
to
exhaust
here
you
have
sold
it
do
you
remember
for
sixty
or
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
you
are
not
expected
to
have
any
left
over
for
pleasures
that
will
be
robbery
masters
suffer
much
from
peculation
indeed
in
this
way
but
a
machine
is
in
course
of
invention
which
shall
put
an
end
to
this
by
the
application
of
which
to
your
heart
the
will
know
whether
or
not
you
have
spent
every
available
in
his
slavery
during
the
day
or
whether
you
are
endeavouring
you
miserable
thief
to
steal
home
with
a
little
remnant
of
it
for
your
children
at
night
this
was
the
theory
of
the
office
as
henry
once
heard
it
expressed
with
a
cynicism
more
brief
and
direct
from
the
lips
of
one
of
his
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
in
certain
respects
his
experience
was
extreme
there
are
offices
which
are
the
ears
and
eyes
of
activities
absorbingly
and
even
romantically
human
to
be
in
a
is
not
perhaps
to
be
the
rose
but
it
is
to
live
near
it
the
great
rose
of
the
sea
you
are
so
to
say
a
a
supercargo
left
on
shore
your
are
lashed
with
hurricanes
your
talk
is
frequently
of
cyclones
the
names
of
far
romantic
isles
are
constantly
on
your
lips
and
your
bills
of
lading
are
threepenny
romances
in
themselves
strange
produce
of
distant
lands
are
your
daily
concern
and
the
four
winds
meet
at
your
counter
with
a
savour
of
tar
for
all
you
know
a
pirate
may
claim
your
attention
any
minute
of
the
day
or
again
to
be
say
in
a
a
of
the
fruitful
earth
there
at
your
telephone
you
may
hear
the
whispering
to
you
hear
the
wheat
waving
in
the
wind
and
the
thin
chatter
of
oats
or
you
may
sell
butter
and
cheese
in
an
office
that
smells
of
farms
however
removed
you
are
an
indirect
agent
of
the
earth
a
humble
of
the
seasons
and
the
eternal
needs
of
man
or
once
more
you
may
be
one
of
the
thousand
clerks
of
a
great
manufacturer
and
be
humbly
related
to
one
of
the
arts
or
crafts
that
gladden
the
eye
or
add
to
the
comforts
of
man
or
even
though
you
may
be
denied
so
close
an
association
with
the
elements
or
the
arts
you
may
be
the
pen
to
some
subtle
legal
confidante
of
human
nature
your
office
may
be
stored
with
records
of
human
perversity
and
whimsicality
you
may
be
the
witness
to
fantastic
wills
or
assist
in
the
administration
of
the
estates
of
lunatics
at
all
events
you
will
come
within
hearing
of
the
human
passions
misers
will
visit
you
at
times
and
beautiful
ladies
in
mourning
deep
as
their
distress
and
from
your
desk
you
will
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
sombre
pageantry
of
litigious
man
though
it
is
true
that
a
certain
flavour
of
these
legal
excitements
occasionally
enlivened
the
business
to
which
henry
had
been
sacrificially
indentured
for
the
most
part
it
was
an
abstract
parasitical
thing
which
had
succeeded
in
persuading
other
businesses
more
directly
fed
from
the
human
spring
of
its
obliging
usefulness
in
relieving
them
of
detachable
burdens
in
fact
it
had
no
activity
or
interest
of
its
own
to
account
for
so
it
proposed
in
default
of
any
such
original
reason
for
existence
to
look
after
the
accounts
of
others
as
a
body
of
financial
police
for
those
engaged
in
it
except
those
who
had
been
born
mentally
deformed
or
those
who
had
become
unnaturally
perverted
by
long
usage
it
was
a
sort
of
penitentiary
of
the
mathematics
chapter
x
the
grass
between
the
yes
it
was
a
curiously
unreal
world
and
for
the
first
day
or
two
as
henry
bent
lonely
and
bewildered
over
his
desk
studied
it
furtively
with
questioning
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
he
had
strayed
into
some
asylum
for
the
insane
where
fantastic
interests
and
mock
honours
take
the
place
of
the
real
interests
and
honours
of
sane
human
beings
part
of
the
business
of
the
firm
consisted
in
the
collection
of
frequently
entailing
visits
from
tenants
and
questions
of
repairs
a
certain
smith
a
wiry
little
man
with
a
keen
face
and
a
decisive
manner
looked
after
this
branch
and
the
gusto
with
which
he
did
it
was
one
of
henry
earliest
and
most
instructive
amazements
were
quite
evidently
his
poetry
and
he
never
seemed
so
happy
as
when
passionately
wrangling
with
a
tenant
on
some
question
of
drains
the
words
cesspool
and
words
to
which
i
do
pretend
to
attach
any
meaning
seemed
to
be
particular
favourites
of
his
in
fact
an
hour
seldom
passed
without
their
falling
from
his
lips
but
smith
great
opportunity
was
a
gale
for
that
always
meant
an
exciting
harvest
of
dislodged
flying
slates
and
smashed
skylights
which
would
impart
an
energetic
interest
to
his
life
for
days
again
in
henry
department
for
the
office
was
cut
into
two
halves
with
about
ten
clerks
in
each
the
partners
having
of
course
their
own
private
offices
from
which
they
might
dart
out
at
any
moment
there
was
a
certain
little
fussy
chief
clerk
who
was
obviously
a
person
of
very
mysterious
importance
he
was
frequently
away
evidently
on
missions
of
great
moment
for
always
on
his
return
he
would
be
closeted
immediately
with
one
or
other
of
the
partners
who
in
turn
seemed
to
consider
him
important
too
and
would
sometimes
treat
him
almost
like
one
of
themselves
actually
condescending
to
laugh
with
him
now
and
again
over
some
joke
evidently
as
mysterious
as
all
the
rest
this
perkins
seldom
noticed
the
juniors
in
his
department
though
occasionally
he
would
select
one
of
them
to
accompany
him
on
one
of
his
missions
to
clients
of
the
firm
and
they
would
start
off
together
as
you
may
see
a
plumber
and
his
apprentice
sometimes
in
the
streets
the
proud
in
front
and
the
little
apprentice
plumber
behind
carrying
the
lead
pipe
and
the
iron
now
did
smith
really
take
such
a
in
cesspools
and
as
he
appeared
to
do
and
did
perkins
really
think
he
mattered
all
that
these
were
two
of
the
earliest
questions
which
henry
asked
himself
and
as
time
brought
the
answers
to
them
and
kindred
questions
there
were
unexpected
elements
of
comfort
for
the
heart
of
the
boy
longing
so
desperately
in
that
barren
place
for
any
hint
of
the
human
touch
one
day
smith
startled
him
by
mentioning
dickens
and
even
charles
lamb
it
was
a
kindly
recognition
of
mesurier
rumoured
interest
in
literature
henry
looked
at
him
in
amazement
oh
you
read
then
he
exclaimed
of
anything
so
human
as
reading
he
had
suspected
no
one
in
that
office
then
as
to
the
great
perkins
the
time
came
when
he
was
to
prove
very
human
indeed
for
dying
suddenly
one
day
his
various
work
had
to
pass
into
other
hands
and
bit
by
bit
it
began
to
leak
out
that
those
missions
had
not
been
so
industriously
devoted
to
the
interests
of
the
firm
nor
been
so
carefully
executed
as
had
been
imagined
for
perkins
it
transpired
had
been
fond
of
his
pleasures
could
appreciate
wine
and
liked
an
occasional
informal
holiday
so
posthumously
he
began
to
wear
for
henry
a
faint
halo
of
humanity
indeed
it
did
not
take
henry
many
days
to
realise
that
as
grass
will
force
its
way
even
between
the
in
a
no
little
humanity
contrived
to
support
its
existence
even
in
this
dead
place
by
degrees
he
realised
that
these
apparently
colourless
and
frigid
figures
about
him
had
each
their
separate
individuality
engaging
or
otherwise
that
their
interests
were
by
no
means
centred
on
the
dull
pages
before
them
and
that
for
the
most
part
they
were
very
much
in
a
like
case
with
himself
although
thus
immured
from
the
world
of
realities
they
still
maintained
in
vigorous
activity
many
healthy
outdoor
interests
and
were
quite
keen
in
their
enthusiasm
for
and
remarkably
instructed
in
the
latest
developments
of
football
and
likewise
they
had
retained
an
astonishingly
fresh
and
unimpaired
interest
in
women
and
still
enjoyed
the
simple
pleasures
of
the
glass
and
the
pipe
as
he
understood
this
henry
began
to
feel
more
at
home
and
as
the
characters
of
his
associates
revealed
themselves
he
began
to
see
that
there
were
amongst
them
several
pleasant
and
indeed
merry
fellows
and
that
after
all
fortune
might
have
thrown
him
into
much
worse
company
they
on
their
side
making
like
discoveries
in
him
he
presently
found
himself
admitted
to
their
freemasonry
and
initiated
into
their
many
secret
ways
of
mitigating
their
lot
and
shortening
their
long
days
thus
this
chill
stern
world
of
automata
which
on
first
sight
looked
as
if
no
human
word
or
smile
or
jest
could
escape
the
detection
of
its
iron
laws
revealed
when
you
were
once
inside
it
an
of
pleasant
escapes
and
exciting
truancies
of
which
as
you
grew
accustomed
to
the
risks
and
general
conditions
of
the
life
you
were
able
skilfully
to
avail
yourself
the
main
principle
of
these
was
to
seem
to
spend
twice
as
much
time
on
each
task
as
it
needed
that
you
might
have
the
other
half
for
such
private
uses
as
were
within
your
reach
to
elongate
at
both
ends
so
adroitly
and
on
such
carefully
selected
propitious
occasions
that
the
elongation
or
at
least
the
whole
extent
of
it
would
pass
unobserved
and
in
general
to
gain
time
any
waste
ends
of
five
minutes
or
quarter
hours
on
all
possible
occasions
if
the
reader
calls
this
shirking
and
robbery
he
must
technically
no
doubt
it
was
but
these
clerks
without
so
formulating
it
merely
exercised
the
right
of
all
oppressed
beings
liberally
to
interpret
to
their
own
advantage
where
possible
the
terms
of
an
unjust
contract
which
grinding
economic
conditions
had
compelled
them
to
make
they
had
been
forced
to
promise
too
much
in
exchange
for
too
little
and
they
equalised
the
disparity
where
they
could
whether
they
spent
the
time
thus
hoarded
in
a
profitable
fashion
is
a
question
of
personal
definition
it
was
usually
expended
in
companies
of
twos
or
threes
with
a
pipe
and
a
pot
of
beer
and
much
spirited
talk
in
the
warm
corners
of
adjacent
taverns
and
so
long
as
you
do
drink
too
much
there
has
perhaps
been
invented
none
pleasanter
than
that
way
of
spending
an
hour
certainly
it
was
the
way
for
ale
to
taste
good
and
a
pipe
to
seem
the
most
satisfying
of
all
earthly
consolations
it
was
almost
worth
the
bondage
to
enjoy
the
keen
relish
of
the
escape
by
degrees
though
the
youngest
there
henry
came
to
be
allowed
a
certain
leadership
in
these
sorties
of
the
human
element
he
made
it
his
business
to
stimulate
these
unthrifty
instincts
and
to
fan
the
welcome
sparks
of
natural
idleness
and
so
successfully
that
at
times
there
seemed
to
have
entered
with
him
into
that
gloomy
place
a
certain
bacchic
influence
which
now
and
again
would
prompt
his
comrades
to
such
daring
clutches
of
animated
release
that
the
spirit
of
it
even
pervaded
the
penetralia
of
the
senior
partner
office
with
the
result
that
some
mishap
of
truancy
would
undo
the
genial
work
of
months
and
precipitate
upon
them
for
a
while
the
rigours
of
a
discipline
it
was
after
such
an
occasion
that
in
writing
to
james
mesurier
as
to
the
progress
of
his
son
old
septimus
lingard
had
paid
henry
one
of
the
proudest
compliments
of
his
young
days
i
fear
that
we
shall
make
little
of
your
son
henry
he
wrote
his
head
seems
full
of
literature
and
he
is
so
idle
that
he
is
demoralising
the
whole
office
it
took
henry
more
than
a
year
to
win
that
testimonial
but
the
odds
had
been
so
great
against
him
that
the
wonder
is
he
was
ever
able
to
win
it
at
all
lingard
wrote
demoralise
it
was
his
way
of
saying
humanise
chapter
xi
humanity
in
high
places
one
day
however
henry
was
to
make
the
still
more
surprising
discovery
that
not
only
were
the
clerks
human
beings
but
that
one
of
the
partners
only
one
of
them
was
also
human
he
made
this
discovery
about
the
senior
partner
whose
figure
and
quaint
name
septimus
searle
lingard
had
in
spite
of
his
severity
attracted
him
by
a
certain
musty
distinction
a
stranger
figure
than
septimus
searle
lingard
has
seldom
walked
the
streets
of
any
town
though
not
actually
much
over
sixty
you
would
have
said
he
must
be
a
thousand
his
abnormally
long
narrow
shaven
face
was
so
thin
and
gaunt
and
hollowed
and
his
tall
upright
figure
was
so
painfully
fragile
that
his
black
broadcloth
seemed
almost
too
heavy
for
the
worn
frame
inside
it
and
nothing
in
the
world
else
was
ever
so
piercingly
solemn
as
his
keen
weary
old
eyes
with
his
tall
silk
hat
his
thin
white
hair
his
long
white
face
long
black
and
black
trousers
he
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
distinguished
skeleton
henry
could
never
be
quite
sure
whether
he
was
to
be
classed
as
a
character
or
as
a
genuine
personality
one
thing
was
certain
that
sometime
or
other
or
many
times
in
his
life
he
had
done
something
or
many
things
which
had
won
for
him
a
respect
as
deep
as
his
solemnity
of
aspect
and
certainly
if
gravity
of
demeanour
goes
for
anything
all
the
owls
of
all
the
ages
in
collaboration
could
not
have
produced
an
expression
of
wisdom
so
convincing
sometimes
his
old
would
emit
an
uncanny
cackle
of
a
laugh
and
a
ghastly
flicker
of
humour
play
across
his
parchment
features
but
these
only
deepened
the
general
sense
of
solemnity
as
the
hoot
of
a
deepens
the
loneliness
of
some
desolate
hollow
among
the
hills
it
was
this
strange
old
ghost
of
a
man
that
was
to
be
the
next
to
turn
human
and
it
came
about
like
this
right
away
at
the
top
of
the
building
was
a
lonely
room
where
the
sun
never
shone
in
which
were
stored
away
the
old
diaries
and
various
documents
of
the
firm
and
here
too
was
deposited
from
time
to
time
various
wreckage
of
the
same
kind
from
other
businesses
whose
last
offices
had
been
done
by
the
firm
and
whose
records
were
still
preserved
in
the
unlikely
event
of
any
chance
resurrection
of
claim
upon
or
interest
in
their
long
forgotten
names
here
crumbled
the
last
relics
of
many
an
ambitious
enterprise
great
ledgers
with
their
covers
still
fresh
lay
like
slabs
from
which
if
you
wiped
away
the
dust
the
gilded
names
of
foundered
companies
would
flash
as
from
gaudy
tombstones
bursting
with
letters
that
no
eye
would
read
again
so
long
as
the
world
lasted
yellow
from
which
all
the
virtue
had
long
since
exhaled
and
to
which
no
dangling
of
enormous
seals
could
any
longer
lend
a
convincing
air
of
importance
here
everything
was
dead
and
dusty
as
an
old
shoe
the
dry
bones
in
the
valley
of
askelon
were
as
children
skipping
in
the
morning
sun
compared
with
the
dusty
death
that
mouldered
and
mouldered
in
this
lonely
room
this
catacomb
of
dead
businesses
it
was
seldom
necessary
to
visit
this
room
but
occasionally
henry
would
find
an
excuse
to
loiter
an
hour
there
for
there
was
a
certain
dreary
romance
about
the
place
and
the
almost
choking
smell
of
old
leather
seemed
to
promise
all
sorts
of
buried
secrets
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
place
ever
adequately
gratified
the
sense
of
mystery
it
excited
but
after
all
to
excite
the
sense
of
mystery
is
perhaps
better
than
to
gratify
it
and
considering
its
poor
material
this
room
was
quite
a
clever
old
mysteriarch
one
day
however
henry
came
upon
some
writing
that
did
greatly
interest
him
though
it
was
almost
contemporary
it
was
old
septimus
lingard
diary
for
the
year
preceding
which
he
had
got
hold
of
not
his
private
diary
but
the
entirely
public
official
diary
in
which
he
kept
account
of
the
division
of
his
days
among
his
various
clients
for
the
most
part
an
unexciting
record
but
at
the
end
of
the
book
on
one
of
the
general
memoranda
pages
henry
noticed
a
square
block
of
writing
which
to
his
surprise
proved
to
be
a
long
quotation
from
a
book
which
the
old
man
had
been
reading
on
the
immortality
of
the
soul
had
old
septimus
lingard
a
soul
too
a
soul
that
troubled
him
maybe
a
soul
that
had
its
moving
memories
and
its
immortal
aspirations
yes
somewhere
hidden
in
that
strange
legal
document
of
a
body
there
was
evidently
a
soul
lingard
had
a
soul
but
wait
a
moment
here
was
an
addition
of
the
old
man
own
the
passage
quoted
had
been
of
death
and
its
possible
significance
and
it
was
just
a
sigh
a
fear
the
old
man
had
breathed
after
it
high
has
the
encompassed
my
own
solemn
as
were
the
words
in
themselves
they
seemed
doubly
so
in
that
lonely
room
and
henry
was
glad
to
lock
the
door
and
return
to
the
comparatively
living
world
downstairs
but
from
that
moment
old
lingard
was
transfigured
in
his
eyes
beneath
all
the
sternness
of
his
exterior
the
grimness
of
the
business
interests
which
seemed
to
absorb
him
henry
had
discovered
the
blessed
human
spring
and
he
came
too
to
wear
a
certain
pathos
and
sanctity
in
henry
eyes
as
he
remembered
how
old
a
man
he
was
and
that
secretly
all
this
time
while
he
seemed
so
busy
with
this
public
company
and
another
he
was
quietly
preparing
to
die
from
this
moment
tasks
done
for
him
came
to
have
a
certain
joy
in
them
for
his
sake
as
it
were
he
began
to
understand
how
you
might
take
a
pride
in
doing
well
something
that
in
your
opinion
was
not
worth
doing
and
one
day
when
the
old
man
well
satisfied
with
some
work
he
had
done
patted
him
kindly
on
the
back
and
said
we
make
a
business
man
of
you
after
all
the
tears
started
to
his
eyes
and
for
a
moment
he
almost
hoped
that
they

damon
and

by
an
odd
coincidence
the
night
which
had
seen
henry
and
esther
confront
their
father
had
seen
in
another
household
in
which
the
young
people
counted
another
member
of
their
secret
society
of
youth
a
similar
but
even
less
seemly
clash
between
the
generations
ned
hazell
would
be
a
poet
too
and
a
painter
as
well
and
perhaps
a
romantic
actor
but
his
father
tastes
for
his
son
future
lay
in
none
of
these
directions
and
ned
was
for
the
present
in
cotton
now
the
elder
hazell
was
a
man
of
violently
convivial
habits
and
the
with
which
he
was
accustomed
to
enliven
up
till
eleven
of
an
evening
was
apt
to
suffer
a
certain
ungenial
transformation
as
he
reached
his
own
front
door
there
the
wit
would
fail
upon
his
lips
the
twinkle
die
out
of
his
glance
and
an
unaccountable
ferocity
towards
the
household
that
was
waiting
up
for
him
take
their
place
when
possible
he
would
fix
upon
some
trivial
reason
to
give
an
air
of
plausibility
to
this
curious
change
in
him
but
if
that
were
not
forthcoming
he
would
it
appeared
fly
into
a
violent
rage
for
just
that
very
reason
however
on
this
particular
night
heaven
had
provided
him
with
an
heroic
occasion
his
son
he
discovered
was
for
once
out
later
than
his
father
in
what
haunt
of
vice
or
low
place
of
drinking
he
was
at
the
moment
ensnared
no
one
better
than
his
father
could
imagine
the
opportunity
was
one
not
to
be
missed
the
outraged
parent
at
last
realised
that
he
had
borne
with
him
long
enough
borne
long
enough
with
his
folderols
of
art
and
nonsense
and
so
determined
was
he
on
the
instant
that
he
would
have
no
more
of
it
that
with
a
quite
remarkable
energy
he
had
thereupon
repaired
to
his
son
room
opened
the
window
and
begun
vigorously
to
throw
his
pretty
editions
his
dainty
his
drawers
full
of
letters
his
cast
of
the
venus
of
milo
out
on
to
the
lawn
upon
which
at
the
moment
a
heavy
rain
was
also
falling
in
the
very
whirlwind
of
his
righteous
vandalism
his
son
had
returned
and
being
a
muscular
lad
had
taken
his
father
by
the
throat
called
him
a
drunken
beast
and
hurled
him
to
the
floor
where
he
pinned
him
down
with
a
knee
on
his
chest
and
might
conceivably
have
made
an
end
of
him
but
for
the
interference
of
mother
and
sisters
who
succeeded
at
last
in
getting
the
dazed
and
somewhat
sobered
parent
to
bed
having
raked
together
from
the
sodden
beneath
his
window
some
disfigured
remains
of
his
poor
treasures
ned
hazell
had
left
the
house
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
in
good
earnest
for
ever
when
he
confided
the
excitements
of
the
night
to
henry
at
lunch
next
day
and
heard
in
return
his
friend
news
nothing
could
be
more
plain
than
that
they
should
set
up
lodgings
together
and
it
was
therefore
to
the
rooms
of
which
ned
was
already
in
possession
that
henry
cab
had
toppled
with
his
various
belongings
after
those
tearful
farewells
at
his
father
door
esther
followed
presently
to
help
make
the
place
straight
and
dainty
for
the
two
boys
and
having
left
them
late
that
evening
with
flowers
in
all
the
jars
and
the
curtains
as
they
should
be
they
were
fairly
launched
on
their
new
life
together
in
mike
henry
had
a
stanch
friend
and
an
admirer
against
all
comers
and
in
henry
mike
had
a
friend
and
admirer
no
less
loyal
but
their
friendship
was
one
for
which
an
might
have
found
it
less
easy
to
give
reasons
than
for
that
of
henry
and
ned
mike
and
henry
loved
each
other
it
would
appear
less
for
any
correspondence
in
dispositions
or
tastes
as
just
because
they
were
mike
and
henry
right
away
down
in
their
natures
there
was
evidently
some
central
affinity
which
operated
even
in
spite
of
surface
contradictions
there
was
much
of
this
intrinsic
quality
in
the
affection
of
henry
and
ned
also
but
it
was
much
more
to
be
accounted
for
by
evident
mutual
sympathies
it
was
largely
the
impassioned
fellowship
of
two
craftsmen
in
love
with
the
same
art
both
had
their
literary
ambitions
but
irrespective
of
those
they
both
loved
poetry
yes
how
they
loved
it
ned
was
perhaps
particularly
a
born
appreciator
and
it
was
worth
seeing
how
the
tears
would
come
into
his
fine
eyes
as
his
voice
shook
with
tenderness
over
a
fine
phrase
or
a
noble
passage
they
had
discovered
some
of
the
most
thrilling
things
in
english
literature
together
at
that
impressionable
age
when
such
things
mean
most
to
us
together
they
had
read
keats
for
the
first
wonderful
time
together
learned
shakespeare
sonnets
by
heart
together
rolled
out
over
the
sumptuous
cadences
of
de
quincey
wonderful
indeed
and
never
to
be
forgotten
were
those
evenings
when
the
day
at
last
over
they
would
leave
their
offices
behind
them
and
while
the
sunset
was
turning
the
buildings
of
tyre
into
enchanted
towers
and
a
clemency
of
release
breathed
upon
its
streets
steal
to
the
quiet
corner
of
their
favourite
tavern
to
drink
port
and
share
their
last
new
author
or
their
own
latest
rhymes
and
then
to
emerge
again
with
high
calm
hearts
and
eloquent
eyes
beneath
the
splendid
stars
all
the
arts
within
their
reach
they
thus
shared
together
pictures
music
theatres
in
a
fine
comradeship
together
they
had
bravoed
the
great
tragedians
and
together
hopelessly
worshipped
the
beautiful
faces
enskied
and
sainted
of
famous
actresses
in
fact
they
were

and
pythias
of

chapter
xiii
damon
and
pythias
at
the
theatre
once
long
before
the
beginning
of
this
story
damon
and
pythias
were
sitting
in
a
theatre
together
with
the
wonderful
overture
just
beginning
to
steal
through
their
senses
ah
violins
whither
would
you
take
their
souls
you
call
to
them
like
the
voice
of
one
waiting
by
the
sea
bathed
in
sunset
what
are
these
wonderful
things
you
are
whispering
to
their
souls
you
promise
ah
what
things
you
promise
strange
voices
of
the
string
oh
sirens
have
pity
their
hearts
are
pure
their
bodies
sweet
as
apples
oh
be
faithful
betray
them
not
beautiful
voices
of
the
wondrous
world
the
overture
had
succeeded
their
souls
had
followed
it
over
the
footlights
and
floating
in
the
limelight
shone
there
awaiting
the
fulfilment
of
the
promise
the
play
was
pygmalion
and
galatea
and
at
the
appearance
of
galatea
they
knew
that
the
overture
had
not
lied
there
in
dazzling
white
flesh
was
all
it
had
promised
and
when
she
called
how
their
hearts
thumped
for
they
knew
it
was
really
them
she
was
calling
it
was
as
though
cleopatra
called
them
from
the
tomb
their
hands
met
they
could
hear
each
other
blood
singing
and
was
not
the
play
itself
an
allegory
of
their
coming
lives
did
not
galatea
symbolise
all
the
sleeping
beauty
of
the
world
that
was
to
awaken
warm
and
fragrant
at
the
kiss
of
their
youth
and
somewhere
too
shrouded
in
enchanted
quiet
such
a
white
white
woman
waited
for
their
kiss
in
a
vision
they
saw
life
like
the
treasure
cave
of
the
arabian
thief
and
they
said
to
their
beating
hearts
that
they
had
the
secret
of
the
magic
word
that
the
open
sesame
was
youth
no
fall
of
the
curtain
could
hide
the
vision
from
their
young
eyes
it
transfigured
the
faces
of
their
crowding
from
the
pit
it
made
another
stage
of
the
embers
of
the
sunset
a
distant
bridge
of
silver
far
down
the
street
then
they
took
it
with
them
to
the
tavern
and
to
write
of
the
solemn
libations
of
that
night
would
be
to
laugh
or
cry
only
youth
can
be
so
radiantly
ridiculous
they
had
found
their
own
corner
turning
down
the
gas
the
fire
played
at
day
and
night
with
their
faces
imagine
them
in
one
of
the
flashes
solemnly
raising
their
glasses
hands
clasped
across
the
table
earnest
gleaming
eyes
holding
each
other
above
it
old
man
some
day
somewhere
a
woman
like
that
but
there
was
still
a
sequel
at
home
at
last
and
in
bed
how
could
damon
sleep
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
got
into
a
rosy
sunset
cloud
in
mistake
for
his
bed
the
candle
was
out
and
yet
the
room
was
full
of
rolling
light
it
was
no
use
he
must
get
up
so
striking
a
light
he
was
presently
deep
in
the
composition
of
a
fiery
sonnet
it
was
evidently
that
which
had
caused
all
the
phosphorescence
but
a
sonnet
is
a
mere
it
holds
nothing
a
mere
and
oh
the
raging
sea
it
could
not
hold
besides
being
confessedly
an
duly
licenced
to
lie
it
was
apt
to
be
misunderstood
it
could
not
say
in
plain
words
meet
me
at
the
pier
at
three
in
the
afternoon
it
could
make
no
assignation
nearer
than
the
isles
of
the
blest
after
life
fitful
fever
therefore
it
seemed
well
to
add
a
postscript
to
that
effect
in
prose
but
then
how
was
she
to
receive
it
there
was
nothing
to
be
hoped
from
the
post
and
damon
home
in
sidon
was
three
miles
from
the
ferry
likewise
it
was
now
nearing
three
in
the
morning
just
time
to
catch
the
three
boat
run
up
to
the
theatre
a
mile
away
and
meet
the
return
boat
so
down
down
through
the
creaking
house
carefully
as
though
he
were
a
jason
picking
his
way
among
the
coils
of
the
sleeping
dragon
and
soon
he
was
shooting
through
the
phantom
streets
like
mercury
on
a
message
through
hades
at
last
the
river
came
in
sight
growing
in
the
earliest
dawn
he
could
see
the
boat
nuzzling
up
against
the
pier
and
snoring
in
its
sleep
he
said
to
himself
that
this
was
styx
and
the
fare
an
obolus
as
he
jumped
on
board
with
hot
face
and
hotter
heart
charon
clicked
his
signal
to
the
engines
the
boat
slowly
snuffled
itself
half
awake
and
shoved
out
into
the
sleepy
water
as
they
crossed
the
light
grew
and
the
of
tyre
beaconed
with
fading
gleam
overhead
began
a
restlessness
in
the
clouds
as
of
a
giant
drowsily
shuffling
off
some
of
his
bedclothes
but
as
yet
he
slept
and
only
the
silver
bosom
of
his
spouse
the
moon
was
uncovered
when
they
landed
the
streets
of
tyre
were
already
light
but
empty
as
though
they
had
got
up
early
to
meet
some
one
who
had
not
arrived
damon
sped
through
them
like
a
that
has
the
harbour
to
itself
and
was
not
long
in
reaching
the
theatre
how
desolate
the
looked
that
had
been
so
companionable
but
three
or
four
hours
before
and
there
was
her
photograph
surely
it
was
an
omen
ah
my
angel
see
i
am
bringing
you
my
heart
in
a
song
my
heart
in
this
my
singing
he
dropped
the
letter
into
the
box
but
as
he
turned
away
momentarily
glancing
up
the
long
street
he
caught
sight
of
an
approaching
figure
that
could
hardly
be
mistaken
good
heavens
it
was
pythias
and
he
too
was
carrying
a
letter
chapter
xiv
contributions
towards
a
genealogy
the
egregious
miss
bashkirtseff
did
not
greatly
fascinate
esther
her
egotism
was
too
hard
too
even
for
egotism
and
there
was
generally
about
her
a
lack
of
sympathy
her
passion
for
fame
had
something
provincial
in
its
eagerness
and
her
broadest
ideals
seemed
to
become
limited
by
her
very
anxiety
to
compass
them
even
her
love
of
art
seemed
a
form
of
snobbery
in
all
these
young
mesuriers
there
was
implicit
partly
as
a
of
the
sense
of
humour
and
partly
as
an
unconscious
mysticism
a
surprising
instinct
for
allowing
the
successes
of
this
world
their
proper
value
and
no
more
even
esther
who
was
perhaps
the
most
worldly
of
them
all
and
whose
ambitions
were
largely
social
as
became
a
bonny
girl
whom
nature
had
marked
out
to
be
popular
and
on
whom
some
day
when
mike
was
a
great
actor
and
had
a
theatre
of
his
own
would
devolve
the
cares
of
populous
at
home
days
bright
suppers
and
all
the
various
diplomacies
of
the
popular
wife
of
fame
even
esther
however
brilliant
her
life
might
become
would
never
for
a
moment
imagine
that
such
success
was
a
thing
worth
winning
at
the
expense
of
the
smallest
loss
to
such
human
realities
as
the
affection
she
felt
for
mike
and
henry
to
love
some
one
well
and
faithfully
to
be
one
of
a
little
circle
vowed
to
eternal
fidelity
one
to
the
other
such
was
the
initial
success
of
these
young
lives
and
it
was
to
make
them
all
their
days
safe
from
the
dangers
of
more
meretricious
successes
all
the
same
though
the
chief
performer
in
marie
confessions
interested
her
but
little
the
stage
on
which
for
a
little
while
she
had
scolded
and
whimpered
did
interest
her
for
should
it
not
have
been
her
stage
too
and
henry
stage
and
dot
stage
and
mother
stage
too
you
had
only
to
look
at
father
to
realise
that
nature
had
really
meant
him
for
the
great
stage
here
in
sidon
what
was
he
but
a
god
in
exile
bending
great
powers
and
a
splendid
character
upon
ridiculously
unimportant
interests
indeed
was
not
his
destiny
more
or
less
their
destiny
as
a
family
henry
would
escape
from
it
through
literature
and
she
through
mike
but
what
of
dot
what
of
mat
not
yet
to
speak
of
the
children
all
she
envied
marie
bashkirtseff
was
her
opportunity
great
goddess
opportunity
so
much
had
come
to
marie
in
the
cradle
and
came
daily
to
a
hundred
thousand
insignificant
aristocratic
babes
to
approach
which
for
the
mesuriers
even
ten
years
too
late
meant
convulsions
of
the
home
and
to
attain
which
in
any
satisfactory
degree
was
probably
impossible
french
for
example
and
music
why
if
so
disposed
marie
bashkirtseff
might
have
read
old
french
romances
at
ten
and
to
play
chopin
at
an
earlier
age
was
not
surprising
in
the
opportunitied
aristocratic
infant
oh
why
had
they
not
been
born
like
the
other
sidonians
whose
natures
and
ideals
had
been
mercifully
calculated
to
the
meridian
of
sidon
why
did
they
think
the
proudfoots
and
the
wilkinsons
and
the
wagstaffs
and
other
local
people
of
importance
and
why
did
they
think
the
mayor
a
ludicrous
upstart
and
the
adjacent
a
sententious
old
idiot
far
better
to
have
rested
content
in
that
state
of
life
to
which
god
had
called
them
to
talk
french
or
to
play
chopin
what
did
it
matter
in
one
sense
nothing
but
in
another
it
mattered
like
other
convenient
facilities
of
life
to
the
immortal
soul
it
mattered
nothing
but
to
the
mortal
social
unit
it
made
life
the
easier
made
the
passage
of
ideas
the
intercourse
of
individualities
the
readier
and
in
general
facilitated
spiritual
and
intellectual
as
well
as
social
communication
to
be
in
your
instincts
in
all
your
fibres
and
in
your
opportunities
that
was
a
bitter
indignity
of
circumstance
this
sense
of
aristocracy
it
must
be
observed
lest
it
should
have
been
insufficiently
implied
was
almost
humorously
dissociated
in
the
minds
of
the
young
mesuriers
from
any
recorded
family
distinctions
in
so
far
as
it
was
conscious
it
was
defiantly
independent
of
genealogy
had
the
mesuriers
possessed
a
james
mesurier
would
probably
have
kept
it
locked
up
as
a
frivolity
to
be
ashamed
of
for
it
was
a
part
of
his
puritanism
that
such
earthly
distinctions
were
foolishness
with
god
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
between
adam
and
the
immediate
of
the
young
mesuriers
there
was
a
void
which
the
herald
office
would
have
found
a
difficulty
in
filling
this
it
never
occurred
to
them
to
mind
in
the
least
it
was
one
of
henry
maxims
that
a
distinguished
product
implied
a
distinguished
process
and
that
at
all
events
the
genealogical
process
was
only
illustratively
important
it
would
have
been
interesting
to
know
how
they
the
mesuriers
came
to
be
what
they
were
in
the
dark
night
of
their
history
a
family
portrait
or
two
or
an
occasional
reference
in
history
would
have
been
an
entertaining
illumination
but
such
not
being
forthcoming
they
were
documentally
so
much
the
less
indebted
to
their
progenitors
yet
if
they
had
only
been
able
to
claim
some
ancestor
with
a
wig
and
a
degree
for
the
humanities
or
some
beautiful
ancestress
with
a
romantic
reputation
one
own
present
is
so
much
more
interesting
for
developing
or
even
repeating
some
one
else
past
and
yet
how
much
better
it
was
to
be
as
they
were
than
as
most
scions
of
aristocratic
lineage
whose
present
was
so
often
nothing
and
their
past
everything
how
humiliating
to
be
so
pathetically
inadequate
an
outcome
of
such
long
and
elaborate
preparation
the
mouse
of
a
genealogical
mountain
yes
it
was
immeasurably
more
satisfactory
to
one
to
be
something
out
of
nothing
than
nothing
out
of
everything
here
so
little
had
made
so
much
here
so
much
had
made
hardly
even
a
lord
it
was
better
for
your
circumstances
to
be
inadequate
for
you
than
you
to
be
inadequate
for
your
circumstances
henry
had
amused
himself
one
day
in
making
a
list
of
all
their
ancestors
to
whom
any
sort
of
worldly
or
romantic
distinction
could
attach
and
it
ran
somewhat
as
follows
a
on
the
father
side
fabled
to
live
in
some
sort
of
a
château
in
guernsey
who
once
a
year
up
till
two
years
ago
when
she
died
had
sent
them
a
hamper
of
apples
from
channel
island
orchards
said
château
believed
by
his
children
to
descend
to
james
mesurier
but
the
latter
indifferent
to
the
matter
and
relatives
on
the
spot
probably
able
to
look
after
it
a
on
the
mother
side
given
to
travel
a
fond
of
books
and
talk
and
rich
in
humanity
surviving
still
in
a
old
silhouette
a
on
the
father
side
who
was
one
of
napoleon
guard
at
helena
a
grandfather
on
the
mother
side
who
used
to
design
and
engrave
little
wooden
blocks
for
patterns
on
and
whose
little
box
of
delicate
instruments
evidently
made
for
the
tracing
of
lines
and
flowers
was
one
of
the
few
family
heirlooms
a
grandmother
on
the
father
side
of
whom
nothing
was
known
beyond
the
beautiful
fact
that
she
was
irish
a
grandfather
on
the
father
side
who
was
a
sailing
his
own
ship
barque
the
lucretia
to
the
west
indies
and
who
died
of
yellow
fever
and
was
buried
in
the
odour
of
romance
on
the
isthmus
of
panama
an
uncle
who
had
also
been
a
and
who
in
rescuing
a
wrecked
crew
from
an
australian
reef
was
himself
capsized
and
after
a
long
swim
finally
eaten
by
a
shark
said
shark
being
captured
next
day
and
found
to
contain
his
head
entire
two
gold
rings
still
in
his
ears
which
he
wore
for
after
the
manner
of
common
sailors
and
one
of
which
after
its
strange
vicissitudes
had
found
a
in
the
secretaire
of
his
brother
james
mesurier
such
was
the
only
accessible
ancestry
of
the
mesuriers
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
last
state
of
the
family
was
socially
worse
than
the
first
james
mesurier
was
unapproachably
its
present
summit
its
alpine
peak
and
he
was
made
to
suffer
for
it
no
little
by
humble
and
impecunious
relatives
still
whatever
else
they
lacked
henry
mesurier
loved
to
insist
that
these
various
connections
were
rich
in
character
one
or
two
of
them
inexhaustible
in
humour
and
their
rare
and
somewhat
timorous
visits
to
the
castle
of
their
exalted
relative
james
mesurier
were
occasions
of
much
mirthful
embarrassment
to
the
young
people
here
the
reader
is
requested
to
excuse
a
brief
parenthetical
chapter
by
way
of
illustration
which
if
he
pleases
he
may
skip
without
any
loss
of
continuity
in
the
narrative
or
the
least
offence
in
the
world
to
the
writer
this
present

be
found
continued

sixteen
chapter
xv
merely
a
humble
interruption
and
illustration
of
the
last
some
peaceable
afternoon
when
mesurier
was
enjoying
a
little
doze
on
the
parlour
sofa
and
her
three
elder
daughters
were
snatching
an
hour
or
two
from
housework
they
had
already
left
school
for
a
little
private
reading
the
drowsy
house
would
suddenly
be
awakened
by
one
loud
wooden
knock
at
the
door
now
whoever
can
that
be
the
three
girls
would
impatiently
exclaim
and
presently
the
maid
would
come
to
miss
esther
to
say
that
there
was
an
old
man
at
the
door
asking
for
mesurier
what
his
name
jane
he
would
give
it
miss
he
said
it
would
be
all
right
mesurier
would
know
him
well
enough
whoever
can
it
be
what
he
like
jane
he
looks
like
a
workman
miss
very
old
and
rather
dotey
who
can
it
be
go
and
ask
him
his
name
again
esther
would
then
arouse
her
mother
and
the
maid
would
come
in
to
say
that
at
last
the
old
man
had
been
persuaded
to
confide
his
name
as
clegg
samuel
clegg
tell
the
missus
it
samuel
clegg
the
old
man
had
said
with
a
certain
amusing
conceit
she
be
glad
enough
to
see
samuel
clegg
why
said
mesurier
it
your
father
poor
old
uncle
clegg
now
girls
you
must
run
away
but
try
and
be
nice
to
him
he
a
simple
good
old
man
mesurier
was
no
more
interested
in
clegg
than
her
daughters
but
she
had
a
great
fund
of
humanity
and
an
inexhaustible
capacity
for
suffering
bores
brilliantly
why
i
never
she
would
say
adapting
her
idiom
to
make
the
old
man
feel
at
home
as
he
was
presently
ushered
in
chuntering
and
triumphant
you
do
mean
to
say
it
uncle
clegg
well
we
are
glad
to
see
you
i
was
just
having
a
little
nap
and
so
you
must
excuse
my
keeping
you
waiting
ay
mary
it
right
nice
of
you
to
make
me
so
welcome
i
got
a
bit
misdoubtful
at
the
door
for
the
young
maid
seemed
somehow
a
little
frightened
of
me
but
when
i
told
the
name
it
was
all
right
clegg
i
said
be
glad
enough
to
see
samuel
clegg
i
said
glad
indeed
murmured
mesurier
i
should
think
so
find
a
chair
for
your
uncle
esther
ay
the
name
did
it
chuckled
the
old
man
who
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
anything
but
a
humble
old
person
and
to
whom
the
bare
fact
of
existence
and
the
name
of
clegg
seemed
warrant
enough
for
thinking
quite
a
lot
of
yourself
i
afraid
you
do
remember
your
old
uncle
said
the
old
man
to
esther
looking
dimly
round
and
rather
bewildered
by
the
fine
young
ladies
actually
he
was
only
a
remote
courtesy
uncle
having
married
their
father
mother
sister
oh
of
course
uncle
clegg
said
esther
a
true
daughter
of
her
mother
but
you
see
it
a
long
time
since
we
saw
you
and
this
is
dorcas
come
and
kiss
your
uncle
dorcas
and
this
is
matilda
said
mesurier
ay
said
the
old
man
and
you
all
growing
up
such
fine
young
ladies
deary
me
mary
but
they
must
make
you
feel
old
we
were
just
going
to
have
some
tea
said
esther
would
you
like
a
cup
uncle
i
daresay
your
uncle
would
rather
have
a
glass
of
beer
said
mesurier
ay
you
right
there
mary
answered
the
old
man
right
there
a
glass
of
beer
is
good
enough
for
samuel
clegg
a
glass
of
beer
and
some
bread
and
cheese
as
the
old
saying
is
is
good
enough
for
a
king
but
bread
and
cheese
and
water
is
fit
for
a
beggar
all
laughed
obligingly
and
the
old
man
turned
to
a
bulging
pocket
which
had
evidently
been
on
his
mind
from
his
entrance
i
got
a
little
present
here
from
esther
he
said
esther
being
the
aunt
after
whom
mike
esther
had
been
named
bringing
out
a
little
newspaper
parcel
but
i
must
tell
you
from
the
beginning
well
you
know
mary
he
continued
i
was
feeling
rather
low
yesterday
and
esther
said
to
me
not
take
a
day
off
samuel
and
see
mary
it
shake
you
up
a
bit
and
i
be
bound
right
glad
to
see
you
lass
i
said
the
very
thing
see
if
i
do
go
in
the
morning
so
this
morning
he
continued
she
tidies
me
up
you
know
her
way
and
sends
me
off
but
before
i
started
she
said
samuel
you
must
take
this
with
my
love
to
mary
i
kept
it
wrapped
up
in
this
drawer
for
thirty
years
and
only
the
other
day
our
mary
elizabeth
said
you
might
give
me
that
old
jug
it
would
look
nice
in
our
little
parlour
but
no
i
says
mary
elizabeth
if
any
one
to
have
that
jug
it
your
aunt
mary
how
kind
of
her
murmured
mesurier
sympathetically
yes
those
were
her
words
mary
said
the
old
man
unfolding
the
newspaper
parcel
and
revealing
an
ugly
little
jug
of
metallically
glistening
earthenware
such
as
were
turned
out
with
strange
pride
from
certain
english
potteries
about
seventy
years
ago
it
seemed
made
in
imitation
of
metal
a
sort
of
earthenware
pewter
and
evidently
it
had
been
a
great
aesthetic
treasure
in
the
eyes
of
clegg
mesurier
received
it
accordingly
how
pretty
she
said
and
how
kind
of
aunt
esther
they
do
make
such
things
nowadays
no
it
a
vallyble
relic
said
the
old
man
but
you
worthy
of
it
mary
i
rather
see
you
have
it
than
any
of
them
my
word
but
glad
i
got
it
here
safely
esther
would
never
have
forgiven
me
now
samuel
she
said
as
i
left
you
get
home
before
dark
and
sit
on
the
jug
whatever
you
do
meanwhile
the
young
ladies
were
in
imminent
danger
of
convulsions
and
at
that
moment
further
to
enhance
the
situation
an
old
lady
of
the
neighbourhood
who
occasionally
dropped
in
for
a
gossip
was
announced
she
was
a
prim
little
lady
with
cranford
curls
and
a
certain
charm
and
vanity
about
her
and
very
deaf
she
too
was
a
character
in
her
way
but
so
different
from
old
clegg
that
the
entertainment
to
be
expected
from
their
conjunction
was
irresistible
even
to
anticipate
this
is
clegg
an
uncle
of
mesurier
said
poor
mesurier
by
way
of
introduction
do
marm
said
clegg
without
rising
mrs
turtle
bowed
primly
are
you
sure
my
dear
i
do
interrupt
she
said
to
mesurier
shall
i
not
call
in
some
other
day
oh
dear
no
said
mesurier
esther
get
mrs
turtle
a
little
whisky
and
water
oh
my
dear
exclaimed
mrs
turtle
only
the
least
little
drop
in
the
world
esther
dear
my
heart
you
know
my
dear
even
so
short
a
walk
as
this
tires
me
out
mesurier
responded
sympathetically
and
then
by
way
of
making
himself
pleasant
clegg
suddenly
broke
in
with
such
an
extraordinary
amenity
of
gallantry
that
everybody
hair
stood
on
end
how
old
do
you
be
he
said
bowing
to
the
i
beg
your
pardon
said
mrs
turtle
putting
her
hand
to
her
ear
but
i
slightly
deaf
how
old
do
you
be
shouted
the
old
man
though
not
unnaturally
taken
aback
at
such
an
unwonted
conception
of
conversational
intercourse
mrs
turtle
recovered
herself
with
considerable
humour
and
bridling
with
an
shake
of
her
head
said
what
would
you
take
me
for
i
should
say
you
were
seventy
if
you
a
day
promptly
answered
the
old
man
oh
dear
no
replied
mrs
turtle
with
some
pique
i
was
only
sixty
last
january
well
you
carry
your
age
badly
retorted
the
old
man
not
to
be
beaten
what
does
he
say
my
dear
said
the
poor
old
lady
turning
to
mesurier
you
carry
your
age
badly
shouted
the
determined
old
man
she
should
see
our
esther
should
she
mary
the
silence
here
of
the
young
people
was
positively
electric
with
suppressed
laughter
two
of
them
escaped
to
explode
in
another
room
and
esther
and
her
mother
were
left
to
save
the
situation
but
on
such
occasions
as
these
mesurier
grew
positively
great
and
the
manner
in
which
she
contrived
to
turn
the
conversation
and
smooth
over
the
terrible
hiatus
was
a
feat
that
admits
of
no
worthy
description
presently
the
old
man
rose
to
go
as
the
clock
neared
five
he
had
promised
to
be
home
before
dark
and
esther
would
think
him
benighted
if
he
should
be
late
he
evidently
had
been
to
america
and
back
in
that
short
afternoon
well
mary
he
said
one
never
knows
whether
we
shall
meet
again
i
getting
an
old
man
eh
uncle
clegg
you
worth
twenty
dead
ones
yet
said
mesurier
reassuringly
what
a
strange
old
gentleman
said
mrs
turtle
somewhat
bewildered
as
this
family
apparition
left
the
room
uncle
clegg
esther
was
heard
singing
in
the
hall
be
careful
of
the
steps
give
our
love
to
aunt
esther
then
the
door
would
bang
and
the
whole
house
breathe
a
gigantic
sigh
of
humorous
relief
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
girls
at
home
had
to
put
up
with
well
mother
did
you
ever
see
such
a
funny
old
person
said
esther
on
her
return
to
the
parlour
you
must
laugh
at
him
mesurier
would
say
laughing
herself
he
a
good
old
man
no
doubt
he
good
enough
mother
dear
but
he
unmistakably
funny
esther
would
reply
with
a
whimsical
thought
of
the
family
tree
yes
they
were
a
distinguished
race
chapter

chapter

concluded
no
the
mesuriers
had
absolutely
nothing
to
hope
for
from
their
relations
nothing
to
look
back
upon
less
to
look
forward
to
most
families
however
poor
and
even
had
some
memories
to
dignify
them
or
some
one
possible
contingency
of
pecuniary
inheritance
at
the
very
least
they
had
a
in
the
family
you
seldom
read
the
biographies
of
writers
or
artists
without
finding
references
however
remote
to
at
least
one
person
of
some
distinction
or
substance
to
have
had
even
a
curate
for
an
ancestor
or
a
connection
would
have
been
something
some
frail
link
with
gentility
now
if
instead
of
being
a
rough
old
of
a
trading
ship
grandfather
mesurier
had
only
been
a
charming
old
admiral
living
in
london
and
glad
now
and
again
to
welcome
his
little
country
granddaughters
to
stay
with
him
he
would
probably
have
been
very
dull
but
then
he
would
have
looked
distinguished
and
taken
one
for
walks
in
the
park
or
bought
one
presents
in
the
burlington
arcade
at
least
old
admirals
always
seemed
to
serve
this
indulgent
purpose
in
stories
at
all
events
he
would
have
been
something
some
possible
link
with
an
existence
of
more
generous
opportunities
dot
and
mat
would
then
at
least
have
seen
a
nice
boy
or
two
occasionally
and
in
time
got
married
as
they
deserved
to
be
and
thus
escape
from
this
little
provincial
theatre
of
sidon
who
could
look
at
dot
and
think
that
anything
short
of
a
miracle
a
miracle
like
esther
own
meeting
with
mike
was
going
to
find
her
a
worthy
mate
in
sidon
and
suppose
the
miracle
happened
once
more
in
her
case
what
of
mat
and
all
the
rest
to
be
the
wife
of
a
sidonian
at
the
highest
what
a
fate
henry
and
she
had
often
discussed
this
inadequate
outlook
for
their
younger
sisters
quite
in
the
manner
of
those
whose
positions
of
enlargement
were
practically
achieved
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
for
henry
to
make
haste
to
win
a
name
as
a
writer
and
mike
to
make
his
fortune
as
an
actor
then
another
society
would
be
at
once
opened
to
them
all
yes
what
wonders
were
to
take
place
then
particularly
when
mike
had
made
his
fortune
for
the
financial
prospects
of
the
young
people
were
mainly
centred
in
him
literature
seldom
made
much
money
except
when
it
was
literature
henry
hoped
to
be
too
good
a
writer
to
hope
to
make
money
as
well
but
that
would
be
a
mere
detail
when
mike
was
a
flourishing
manager
for
when
that
had
come
about
had
not
henry
promised
him
that
he
would
not
be
too
proud
to
regard
him
as
his
patron
to
the
extent
of
accepting
from
him
an
allowance
of
say
a
thousand
a
year
no
he
positively
would
agree
to
more
than
a
thousand
and
mike
had
to
be
content
with
his
promising
to
take
that
meanwhile
what
could
girls
at
home
do
but
watch
and
wait
and
make
home
as
pretty
as
possible
and
by
the
aid
of
books
and
pictures
reflect
as
much
light
from
a
larger
world
into
their
lives
as
might
be
on
henry
going
away
the
three
girls
had
promptly
bespoken
the
reversion
of
his
study
as
a
little
for
themselves
here
they
concentrated
their
books
and
some
few
pictures
that
appealed
to
tastes
in
revolt
against
atlantic
liners
but
not
yet
developed
to
the
appreciation
of
those
true
classics
of
art
to
which
indeed
they
had
yet
to
be
introduced
such
masters
as
leighton
sant
and
dicksee
were
as
yet
to
them
something
of
what
rossetti
and
and
certain
old
italian
masters
were
soon
to
become
in
books
they
had
already
learnt
from
henry
a
truer
or
at
all
events
a
more
strenuous
taste
and
they
would
grapple
manfully
with
carlyle
and
browning
and
presently
meredith
long
before
their
lives
had
use
or
understanding
for
such
tremendous
nourishment
one
evening
as
they
were
all
three
sitting
cosily
in
henry
study
as
they
still
faithfully
called
it
esther
was
reading
pride
and
prejudice
aloud
while
dot
and
mat
busied
themselves
respectively
with
macramé
work
and
a
against
a
coming
bazaar
esther
tasks
in
the
house
were
somewhat
illustrated
by
her
part
in
the
trio
this
evening
her
energies
were
mainly
devoted
to
the
higher
nights
of
housekeeping
to
the
aesthetic
activities
of
the
home
arranging
flowers
dusting
vases
and
pictures
and
so
on
and
the
lightness
of
these
employments
was
it
is
to
be
admitted
an
occasionally
raised
grievance
among
the
sisters
to
dot
and
mat
fell
much
more
arduous
and
manual
spheres
of
labour
yet
all
were
none
the
less
grateful
for
the
decorative
innovations
which
esther
acting
on
occasional
hints
from
her
friend
myrtilla
williamson
was
able
to
make
and
if
it
were
true
that
she
hardly
took
her
fair
share
of
and
it
was
equally
undeniable
that
to
her
was
due
the
introduction
of
liberty
silk
curtains
and
cushions
in
two
or
three
rooms
she
too
alas
for
the
mistakes
of
young
taste
had
also
introduced
painted
tambourines
and
swathed
the
lamps
in
wonderful
turbans
of
puffed
tissue
paper
was
she
to
receive
no
credit
for
these
services
then
it
was
she
who
had
dared
to
do
battle
with
her
mother
somewhat
taste
in
dress
and
whenever
the
mesurier
sisters
came
out
in
something
specially
pretty
or
fashionable
it
was
due
to
esther
well
on
this
particular
evening
she
was
as
we
have
said
taking
her
share
in
the
housework
by
reading
jane
austen
aloud
to
dot
and
mat
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
james
mesurier
stood
there
a
little
aloof
for
it
was
seldom
he
entered
this
room
which
perhaps
had
for
him
a
certain
painful
association
of
his
son
rebellion
perhaps
too
the
picture
of
this
happy
little
corner
of
his
children
a
world
evidently
so
complete
in
itself
and
daily
developing
more
and
more
away
from
the
parent
world
in
the
front
parlour
gave
him
a
certain
pang
of
estrangement
perhaps
he
too
felt
as
he
looked
on
them
that
same
dreary
sense
of
disintegration
which
had
overtaken
the
mother
on
departure
and
perhaps
there
was
something
of
that
in
his
voice
as
looking
at
them
with
rather
a
sad
smile
he
said
you
look
very
comfortable
here
children
i
hope
that
a
profitable
book
you
are
reading
esther
oh
yes
father
it
austen
you
know
well
i
sorry
to
interrupt
you
but
i
want
a
few
words
with
dorcas
she
can
join
you
again
soon
so
dot
wondering
what
was
in
store
for
her
rose
and
accompanied
her
father
to
the
front
parlour
where
mesurier
was
peacefully
knitting
in
the
lamplight
dorcas
my
dear
he
said
when
the
door
was
closed
your
mother
and
i
have
had
a
serious
talk
this
evening
on
the
subject
of
your
joining
the
church
you
are
now
nearly
sixteen
and
of
an
age
to
think
for
yourself
in
such
matters
and
we
think
it
is
time
that
you
made
some
profession
of
your
faith
as
a
christian
before
the
world
the
church
james
mesurier
referred
to
was
that
branch
of
the
english
nonconformists
known
as
baptists
and
the
profession
of
faith
was
the
curious
rite
of
baptism
by
complete
immersion
the
importance
claimed
for
which
by
this
sect
is
perhaps
from
a
christian
point
of
view
made
the
less
disproportionate
by
another
condition
attaching
to
it
the
condition
that
not
till
years
of
individual
judgment
have
been
reached
is
one
eligible
for
the
sacred
rite
with
that
rationalism
which
religious
sects
are
so
skilful
in
applying
to
some
unimportant
point
of
ritual
and
so
careful
not
to
apply
to
vital
questions
of
dogma
the
baptists
reasonably
argue
that
to
baptise
an
unthinking
infant
and
by
an
external
rite
which
has
no
significance
except
as
the
symbol
of
an
internal
decision
declare
him
a
christian
is
nothing
more
than
an
idolatrous
mummery
wait
till
the
child
is
of
age
to
choose
for
him
or
herself
to
understand
the
significance
of
the
christian
revelation
and
the
nature
of
the
profession
it
is
called
upon
to
make
then
if
by
the
grace
of
god
it
chooses
aright
let
him
or
her
be
baptised
and
for
the
manner
of
that
baptism
if
symbols
are
to
be
made
use
of
by
the
christian
church
and
it
is
held
wise
among
the
baptists
to
make
use
of
few
and
those
the
most
central
should
they
not
be
designed
as
nearly
after
the
fashion
set
forth
in
the
bible
itself
as
is
possible
the
ordinance
of
the
lord
supper
as
it
is
called
amongst
them
follows
the
procedure
of
the
last
supper
as
recorded
in
the
gospels
should
not
therefore
the
rite
of
baptism
be
in
its
details
similarly
faithful
to
authority
now
in
scripture
as
is
well
known
baptisms
were
complete
immersions
symbolic
alike
of
the
washing
away
of
sin
and
also
of
the
dying
to
this
world
and
the
resurrection
to
the
life
eternal
in
christ
jesus
so
much
theology
was
bred
in
the
bone
of
all
the
young
mesuriers
and
the
youngest
of
them
could
as
readily
have
capitulated
these
articles
of
belief
as
their
father
who
once
more
briefly
summarised
them
for
the
benefit
of
his
daughter
he
ended
with
something
of
a
personal
appeal
it
had
been
one
of
the
griefs
of
his
life
that
henry
and
esther
had
both
refused
to
join
their
father
church
though
esther
always
dutifully
attended
it
every
sunday
morning
and
it
was
thinking
of
them
though
without
naming
them
that
he
said
i
met
trotter
yesterday
trotter
was
the
local
baptist
minister
and
dot
remarked
to
herself
that
her
father
was
able
to
pronounce
his
name
without
the
smallest
suspicion
that
such
a
name
as
belonging
to
a
minister
of
divine
mysteries
was
rather
ludicrous
though
indeed
baptist
ministers
seemed
always
to
have
names
like
that
and
he
asked
me
when
some
of
my
young
ladies
were
going
to
join
the
church
i
confess
the
question
made
me
feel
a
little
ashamed
for
you
know
my
dear
out
of
our
large
family
not
one
of
you
has
yet
come
forward
as
a
christian
no
father
said
dot
at
last
i
hope
my
dear
you
are
not
going
to
disappoint
me
in
this
matter
no
indeed
father
said
dot
whose
nature
was
pliable
and
sympathetic
as
well
as
fundamentally
religious
but
i
afraid
i
have
thought
quite
as
much
about
it
as
i
should
like
to
and
if
you
do
mind
i
should
like
to
have
a
few
days
to
think
it
out
of
course
my
dear
that
is
a
very
right
feeling
for
the
step
is
a
solemn
one
and
should
not
be
taken
without
reverent
thought
you
can
not
do
better
than
to
talk
it
over
with
trotter
if
you
have
any
difficulties
you
can
tell
him
and
i
sure
he
would
be
delighted
to
help
you
is
it
so
mother
well
dear
he
continued
you
can
run
away
now
but
bear
in
mind
what
i
have
said
and
i
shall
hope
to
hear
that
you
have
made
the
right
choice
before
long
kiss
me
dear
and
so
with
something
of
a
lump
in
her
throat
dot
returned
to
the
interrupted
jane
austen
whatever
did
father
want
asked
the
two
girls
looking
up
as
she
entered
the
room
what
do
you
think
said
dot
he
wants
me
to
be
baptised
chapter
xvii
dot
decision
now
in
thus
appealing
to
dot
her
father
had
appealed
to
just
the
one
out
of
all
his
children
who
was
least
likely
to
disappoint
him
to
dot
and
henry
had
unmistakably
been
transmitted
the
largest
share
of
their
father
spirituality
esther
was
not
actively
religious
any
more
than
she
was
actively
poetic
hers
was
one
of
those
composite
admirably
balanced
natures
which
include
most
qualities
and
faculties
but
no
one
in
excess
of
another
such
make
those
engaging
good
women
of
the
world
who
are
able
to
understand
and
sympathise
with
the
most
diverse
interests
and
temperaments
as
it
is
the
characteristic
of
a
good
critic
to
understand
all
those
various
products
of
art
which
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
create
thus
esther
could
have
delighted
a
saint
with
her
sympathetic
comprehension
as
she
could
have
healed
the
wounds
of
a
sinner
by
her
comprehensive
sympathy
but
it
was
certain
she
would
never
be
in
sufficient
excess
spiritually
wrought
or
sensually
rebellious
to
be
one
or
the
other
she
was
beautifully
buoyantly
normal
with
a
happy
expansive
enjoying
nature
glad
in
the
sunlight
brave
in
the
shadow
optimistically
looking
forward
to
blithe
years
of
life
and
love
with
mike
and
her
friends
and
not
feeling
the
necessity
of
being
anxious
about
her
soul
or
any
other
world
but
this
she
was
not
shallow
but
she
merely
realised
life
more
through
her
intelligence
than
through
her
feelings
to
have
become
a
baptist
would
have
offended
her
intelligence
without
bringing
any
satisfaction
to
spiritual
instincts
not
in
any
event
clamorous
as
for
henry
it
was
not
only
activity
of
intelligence
but
activity
of
spirituality
that
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
embrace
any
such
narrow
creed
as
that
proposed
to
him
and
for
the
present
that
spiritual
activity
found
ample
scope
for
itself
in
poetry
dot
however
was
an
intermediate
case
with
an
intelligence
active
too
she
united
a
spirituality
torturingly
intense
but
for
which
she
had
no
such
natural
creative
outlet
as
henry
with
her
loss
of
the
old
creed
in
discarding
which
these
three
sisters
had
followed
the
lead
of
their
brother
with
a
curious
instinctiveness
almost
it
would
seem
independent
of
reasoning
her
spirituality
had
been
left
somewhat
bleakly
houseless
and
she
had
often
longed
for
some
compromise
by
which
she
could
reconcile
her
intelligence
to
the
acceptance
of
some
established
home
of
faith
whose
kindly
enclosing
walls
should
be
more
genially
habitable
to
the
soul
than
the
cold
spaces
which
henry
declared
to
be
sufficient
temple
perhaps
esther
commiseration
of
her
sisters
narrow
opportunities
was
so
far
as
it
related
to
dot
a
little
unnecessary
for
indeed
ambitions
were
not
social
by
nature
shy
and
meditative
and
with
her
religious
bias
had
she
been
born
into
a
catholic
family
she
might
not
improbably
have
found
the
world
well
lost
in
a
sisterhood
the
puritan
conscience
had
an
uncomfortable
preponderance
in
the
deep
places
of
her
nature
and
far
down
in
her
soul
like
her
father
she
would
ask
herself
if
pleasure
could
be
the
end
of
life
was
there
not
something
serious
each
of
us
could
and
ought
to
do
to
justify
his
place
in
the
world
were
we
not
all
under
some
mysterious
solemn
obligation
to
do
something
however
little
in
return
for
life
mat
on
the
other
hand
had
no
such
scruples
she
was
more
like
esther
in
nature
with
a
touch
of
cynicism
curling
her
dainty
lip
arising
perhaps
from
an
early
divination
that
she
was
to
lack
opportunities
perhaps
it
was
because
she
was
the
pessimist
the
quite
cheerful
pessimist
of
the
family
that
she
was
by
far
the
cleverest
and
most
industrious
at
the
housework
if
it
was
her
fate
to
be
cinderella
she
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
with
a
cynical
endurance
and
and
be
cinderella
with
a
good
grace
probably
the
only
glass
slipper
in
the
family
had
already
fallen
to
esther
never
mind
though
her
good
looks
might
fade
with
being
a
good
girl
at
home
year
by
year
what
did
it
matter
after
all
nothing
mattered
in
the
end
and
thus
out
of
a
great
indifference
mat
developed
a
great
unselfishness
and
if
you
could
name
one
special
angel
in
the
house
of
the
mesuriers
she
was
unmistakably
mat
in
addition
to
her
religious
promptings
dot
had
lately
developed
a
great
sympathy
for
her
father
standing
a
little
aside
from
the
conflict
between
him
and
henry
she
was
able
to
divine
something
of
the
feelings
of
both
and
she
had
now
and
again
caught
a
look
of
loneliness
on
her
father
face
that
made
her
ready
to
do
almost
anything
to
please
him
of
course
the
question
was
one
for
general
consultation
she
knew
what
henry
would
say
it
did
much
matter
anyhow
he
would
say
but
it
was
a
pity
how
was
intellectual
freedom
to
be
won
if
those
who
had
seen
the
light
should
thus
deliberately
forego
it
time
after
time
from
such
merely
sentimental
reasons
and
when
she
saw
henry
that
was
just
what
he
did
say
but
she
said
it
would
make
father
so
happy
yes
i
know
he
answered
and
it
would
be
very
beautiful
of
you
besides
of
course
in
one
way
it
only
a
matter
of
symbolism
but
then
on
the
other
hand
it
symbolism
hardened
into
dogmatism
that
has
done
all
the
mischief
do
it
dear
if
you
like
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
as
you
say
it
will
make
father
happy
and
i
shall
quite
understand
dot
was
one
of
those
natures
that
like
to
seek
and
are
liable
to
take
advice
so
after
seeing
henry
she
thought
she
would
see
what
trotter
had
to
say
for
in
spite
of
his
unfortunate
name
trotter
was
a
gentle
cultivated
mind
and
was
indeed
somewhat
incongruously
perhaps
in
a
mild
way
jesuitically
circumstanced
as
a
baptist
minister
henry
and
he
were
great
friends
on
literary
matters
and
dot
and
he
had
had
many
talks
greatly
helpful
to
her
on
spiritual
things
in
fact
chrysostom
trotter
was
one
of
those
numerous
men
between
the
old
beliefs
and
their
new
modifications
which
the
continuous
advance
of
scientific
discovery
and
philosophical
speculation
on
the
one
hand
and
the
obstinate
survival
of
christianity
on
the
other
necessitate
if
men
of
spiritual
intuitions
who
are
not
poets
and
artists
are
to
earn
their
living
there
was
nothing
you
could
say
to
chrysostom
trotter
provided
you
said
it
reverently
that
would
startle
him
he
knew
all
that
long
ago
and
far
more
for
though
obliged
to
trade
in
this
backwater
of
belief
he
was
in
many
respects
a
very
modern
mind
you
were
hardly
likely
to
know
your
herbert
spencer
as
intimately
as
he
and
all
the
most
exquisite
literature
of
doubt
was
upon
his
shelves
though
you
might
declare
him
superficially
disingenuous
you
could
not
unless
you
were
some
commonplace
atheist
or
materialist
gainsay
the
honest
logic
of
his
position
you
believe
that
the
world
that
life
is
a
spiritual
mystery
he
would
say
yes
you
do
not
for
a
moment
think
that
any
materialistic
science
has
remotely
approached
an
adequate
explanation
of
its
meaning
certainly
not
you
believe
too
that
however
it
comes
about
and
whatever
it
means
there
is
an
eternal
struggle
in
man
between
what
for
sake
of
argument
we
will
call
the
higher
and
lower
natures
yes
well
then
this
spiritual
mystery
this
struggle
are
hinted
at
in
various
media
of
human
expression
in
an
variety
of
human
symbols
art
chiefly
concerns
itself
with
the
sexual
mystery
with
the
wonderful
love
of
man
and
woman
in
its
explanation
of
which
alone
science
is
so
pitifully
inadequate
literature
more
fully
concerns
itself
with
the
mystery
of
man
indestructibly
instinctive
relation
to
what
we
call
the
unseen
that
is
the
whole
the
cosmos
god
or
whatever
you
please
to
call
it
but
more
than
literature
religion
has
for
centuries
concerned
itself
with
these
considerations
has
consciously
and
industriously
sought
to
make
itself
the
science
of
what
we
call
the
soul
it
has
thrown
its
observations
just
as
poetry
and
art
have
thrown
their
observations
into
symbolic
forms
of
which
christianity
is
incomparably
the
most
important
you
do
reject
the
revelation
of
human
love
because
hero
and
leander
are
probably
creations
of
the
poet
fancy
will
you
reject
the
revelation
of
divine
love
because
it
chances
for
its
greater
efficiency
in
winning
human
hearts
to
have
found
expression
in
a
similar
human
symbolism
personally
i
hold
that
christ
actually
lived
and
was
literally
the
son
of
god
but
were
the
human
literalness
of
his
divine
story
discredited
the
eternal
verities
of
human
degeneration
and
a
mysterious
regeneration
would
be
no
whit
disproved
externally
christianity
may
be
a
symbol
essentially
it
is
a
science
of
spiritual
fact
as
really
as
geology
is
a
science
of
material
fact
and
as
for
its
miraculous
supernatural
side
are
the
laws
of
nature
so
easy
to
understand
that
we
should
find
such
a
difficulty
in
accepting
a
few
divergencies
from
them
he
who
can
make
laws
for
so
vast
a
universe
may
surely
be
capable
of
inventing
a
few
comparatively
trivial
exceptions
not
perhaps
in
so
many
words
but
in
some
such
spirit
would
chrysostom
trotter
argue
and
it
was
in
some
such
fashion
that
he
talked
in
his
charmingly
sympathetic
way
with
dorcas
mesurier
one
afternoon
as
she
had
tea
with
him
in
a
study
breathing
on
every
hand
the
man
of
letters
rather
than
the
minister
of
a
somewhat
antiquated
sect
my
dear
dorcas
he
said
you
know
me
well
enough
you
know
me
perhaps
better
than
your
father
knows
me
know
me
well
enough
to
believe
that
i
would
urge
you
to
do
this
thing
if
i
did
think
it
was
right
as
well
as
for
your
father
and
me
but
i
know
it
is
right
and
for
this
reason
you
are
a
deeply
religious
nature
but
you
need
some
outward
symbol
to
hold
on
to
you
need
so
to
say
the
magnetising
association
of
a
religious
organisation
henry
can
get
along
very
well
as
many
poets
have
with
his
birds
and
his
sunsets
and
so
forth
but
you
need
something
more
authoritative
it
happens
that
the
church
i
represent
the
church
of
your
father
is
nearest
to
you
you
might
with
all
the
goodwill
in
the
world
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
embrace
some
other
modification
of
the
christian
faith
but
here
is
a
church
so
to
say
ready
for
you
familiar
by
long
association
endeared
to
your
father
you
believe
in
god
you
believe
in
the
spiritual
meaning
of
life
you
believe
that
we
poor
human
beings
need
something
to
keep
our
eyes
fixed
upon
that
spiritual
meaning
well
dear
dorcas
he
ended
abruptly
what
do
you
think
i
do
it
said
dot
good
girl
said
the
minister
sometimes
it
is
a
form
of
righteousness
to
waive
our
doubts
for
those
who
are
at
once
so
dear
and
good
as
your
father
and
do
for
a
moment
think
that
it
will
leave
you
just
where
you
are
these
outward
acts
are
great
energisers
of
the
soul
dear
dorcas
i
welcome
you
into
one
of
god
many
churches
so
it
was
that
dot
came
to
be
baptised
and
to
witness
the
ceremony
all
the
mesuriers
assembled
at
the
chapel
that
sunday
evening
even
henry
who
could
hardly
remember
when
he
used
to
sit
in
this
pew
and
scribble
in
the
back
of
his
during
the
sermon
to
the
mere
mocker
the
rite
of
baptism
by
immersion
might
well
seem
a
somewhat
grotesque
antic
of
sectarianism
but
to
any
one
who
must
needs
find
sympathy
for
any
observance
into
which
in
whatsoever
forgotten
and
superseded
time
has
passed
the
prayerful
enthusiasm
of
man
the
rite
could
hardly
fail
of
a
moving
solemnity
as
chrysostom
trotter
ordered
it
it
was
certainly
made
to
yield
its
fullest
measure
of
impressiveness
to
begin
with
the
chapel
was
quite
a
comely
edifice
inside
and
out
and
its
ministerial
end
with
its
singers
gallery
backed
by
great
organ
pipes
and
fronted
by
a
handsome
pulpit
which
trotter
had
dared
to
garnish
with
chrysanthemums
on
each
side
of
his
bible
had
a
modest
sacerdotal
effect
beneath
the
pulpit
on
ordinary
occasions
stood
the
but
on
evenings
when
the
rite
of
baptism
was
prepared
this
table
and
a
boarding
on
which
it
stood
were
removed
revealing
a
tiled
baptistry
that
is
a
tiled
tank
about
eight
feet
long
and
six
wide
with
steps
on
each
side
descending
into
about
four
feet
of
water
towards
the
close
of
the
service
the
minister
would
leave
his
pulpit
and
during
the
singing
of
a
hymn
would
presently
emerge
from
his
vestry
in
a
long
waterproof
garment
as
the
hymn
ended
some
sister
or
brother
that
night
to
be
admitted
into
the
church
would
timidly
join
him
at
the
baptistry
side
and
together
they
would
go
down
into
the
water
holding
the
hands
of
the
new
communicant
the
minister
in
a
solemn
voice
would
say
sister
or
brother
on
confession
of
your
faith
in
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
i
baptise
thee
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
then
the
organ
would
strike
up
a
triumphant
peal
and
to
the
accompaniment
of
its
music
and
the
mellow
plashing
of
the
water
the
sister
or
brother
would
be
plunged
beneath
the
symbolic
wave
great
was
the
excitement
needless
to
say
in
the
mesurier
pew
as
little
dot
at
last
came
forth
from
the
vestry
and
stealing
down
into
the
water
took
the
minister
hands
there
she
is
there
dot
passed
round
the
pew
and
the
hardest
young
heart
whoever
it
belonged
to
stopped
beating
to
hear
the
words
they
seemed
to
come
with
a
special
personal
tenderness
sister
on
confession
of
your
faith
in
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
i
baptise
thee
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
once
more
the
organ
triumphant
and
the
mellow
splashing
of
the
water
dear
little
dot
she
had
done
it
did
you
see
father
face
esther
whispered
to
henry
yes
perhaps
none
of
them
would
ever
do
such
a
beautiful
thing
as
dot
had
done
that
night
at
least
there
was
one
of
james
mesurier
children
who
had
not
disappointed
him
chapter
xviii
mike
and
his
million
pounds
the
most
exquisite
compliment
a
man
has
ever
paid
to
him
is
worded
something
like
this
well
dear
you
certainly
know
how
to
make
love
and
this
compliment
is
always
the
reward
not
of
passion
however
sustained
or
sentiment
however
refined
but
of
humour
whimsically
fantasticating
and
balancing
both
it
is
the
gentle
laugh
not
violating
but
just
humanising
that
very
solemn
kiss
the
quip
that
just
saves
passion
from
toppling
over
the
brink
into
bathos
that
mark
the
skilful
lover
no
lover
will
long
be
successful
unless
he
is
a
humourist
too
and
is
able
to
keep
the
heart
of
love
amused
a
lover
should
always
be
something
of
an
actor
as
well
not
of
course
for
the
purpose
of
feigning
what
he
does
not
feel
but
so
that
he
may
the
better
dramatise
his
sincerity
mike
had
therefore
many
advantages
over
those
merely
pretty
fellows
whose
rivalry
he
had
once
been
modest
enough
to
fear
he
was
a
master
of
all
the
child
play
of
love
and
to
attempt
to
describe
the
fancies
which
he
found
to
vary
the
game
of
love
would
be
to
run
the
risk
of
exposing
the
limitations
of
the
literary
medium
no
words
can
pull
those
whimsical
faces
or
put
on
those
pathetic
expressions
with
which
he
loved
to
meet
esther
after
some
short
absence
sometimes
he
would
come
into
the
room
a
little
forlorn
sparrow
of
a
creature
signifying
by
a
dejection
in
which
his
very
clothes
took
part
that
he
was
out
in
the
east
wind
of
circumstance
and
no
one
in
the
world
cared
a
shabby
feather
for
him
he
would
stand
shivering
in
a
corner
and
look
timorously
from
side
to
side
till
at
last
he
would
pretend
she
had
warmed
him
with
her
kisses
and
generally
made
him
welcome
to
the
world
sometimes
he
would
come
in
with
his
collar
dismally
turned
up
and
an
old
battered
hat
upon
his
head
and
pretend
that
he
had
had
a
meal
of
kisses
for
a
whole
week
and
occasionally
he
would
come
blowing
out
his
cheeks
like
a
king
trumpeter
to
announce
that
mike
laflin
might
be
at
any
moment
expected
but
for
the
most
part
these
impersonations
were
in
a
minor
key
as
mike
had
soon
discovered
that
the
more
pathetic
he
was
the
more
he
was
hugged
and
called
a
weenty
which
was
one
of
his
own
sad
little
names
for
himself
one
of
his
as
he
would
call
them
was
that
each
morning
as
he
went
to
business
he
really
started
out
in
search
of
a
million
pounds
which
was
somewhere
awaiting
him
and
which
he
might
break
his
shins
over
at
any
moment
it
might
be
here
it
might
be
there
it
might
come
at
any
hour
of
the
day
the
next
post
might
bring
it
it
might
be
in
yonder
parcel
delivery
van
nothing
more
probable
or
at
any
moment
it
might
fall
from
heaven
in
a
parachute
or
be
at
that
second
passing
through
the
wearily
home
from
the
islands
of
sugar
and
spice
you
never
could
tell
well
mike
said
esther
one
evening
as
he
came
in
hopping
in
a
pitifully
wounded
way
and
explaining
that
he
had
been
one
of
the
three
ravens
sitting
on
a
bough
which
the
cruel
huntsman
had
shot
through
the
wing
have
you
found
your
million
pounds
no
not
my
million
pounds
said
mike
i
told
i
shall
find
them
who
told
you
the
weenty
you
silly
old
thing
give
me
a
kiss
are
you
a
dear
tell
me
you
a
dear
i
only
a
poor
little
houseless
roofless
windowless
brainless
mike
you
the
biggest
dear
in
the
world
no
i
not
i
the
littlest
suppose
you
found
your
million
pounds
mike
suppose
did
i
tell
you
i
sure
of
it
well
when
you
find
it
what
will
you
do
with
it
i
buy
the
moon
the
moon
yes
as
a
present
for
henry
would
it
be
rather
dear
not
at
all
twenty
thousand
would
buy
it
any
time
this
last
hundred
years
but
the
worst
of
it
is
no
one
wants
it
but
the
poets
and
they
can
not
afford
it
yet
if
only
a
poet
could
get
hold
of
it
why
what
a
literary
property
it
would
be
you
silly
old
thing
no
but
you
do
seem
to
realise
that
i
quite
serious
think
of
the
money
there
would
be
for
any
poet
who
had
acquired
the
exclusive
literary
rights
in
the
moon
within
a
week
i
have
it
placarded
all
over
trespassers
will
be
prosecuted
and
then
i
no
doubt
henry
would
lend
me
the
man
in
the
moon
for
my
christmas
pantomimes
after
all
it
not
a
bad
idea
said
esther
of
course
it
not
said
mike
but
be
careful
not
to
mention
it
to
henry
just
yet
i
should
like
to
disappoint
him
for
of
course
before
we
took
any
final
steps
in
the
purchase
we
have
to
make
sure
that
it
was
as
some
people
think
made
of
green
cheese
but
never
mind
about
the
moon
tell
us
how
you
got
on
with
the
sothern
the
sothern
was
an
amateur
dramatic
club
in
tyre
which
took
itself
very
seriously
and
to
which
mike
was
seeking
admission
as
a
first
step
towards
london
management
he
had
that
day
passed
an
examination
before
three
of
the
official
members
solemn
and
important
as
though
they
had
been
the
honourable
directors
of
drury
lane
and
had
been
admitted
to
membership
in
the
club
with
the
promise
of
a
small
part
in
their
forthcoming
performance
oh
that
good
said
esther
what
were
they
like
oh
they
were
all
right
rather
humorous
they
gave
me
to
read
me
reading
aram
and
a
scene
out
of
assurance
which
was
of
course
better
naturally
not
one
of
the
men
was
the
remotest
bit
like
himself
one
was
a
queer
kind
of
irving
another
a
sad
sort
of
arthur
roberts
and
the
other
was
shall
we
say
a
tyrian
wyndham
actors
like
poets
have
provincial
parodists
of
their
styles
in
even
greater
numbers
so
adoringly
imitative
is
humanity
some
day
mike
would
have
his
imitators
boys
who
pulled
faces
like
his
and
prided
themselves
on
having
the
laflin
wrinkles
just
as
it
was
once
the
fashion
for
girls
to
look
like
pictures
or
young
poets
to
imitate
swinburne
yes
i
got
my
first
part
i
got
it
in
my
pocket
said
mike
oh
really
that
splendid
exclaimed
esther
with
delight
wait
till
you
see
it
said
mike
bringing
out
a
french
acting
edition
of
some
forgotten
comedy
yes
guess
how
many
words
i
got
to
say
just
exactly
eleven
and
such
words
well
never
mind
dear
it
a
beginning
certainly
it
a
beginning
the
very
beginning
of
a
beginning
come
let
me
see
it
mike
what
are
you
supposed
to
be
at
last
mike
was
persuaded
to
confess
the
humble
little
for
which
the
eminent
actors
who
had
consented
to
be
his
colleagues
had
cast
him
he
was
to
be
the
comic
boy
of
a
man
and
his
distinguished
part
in
the
action
of
the
piece
was
to
come
in
at
a
certain
moment
with
the
pie
that
had
been
ordered
and
as
he
delivered
it
he
was
to
remark
that
a
pie
as
is
a
pie
is
that
there
pie
oh
mike
what
a
shame
exclaimed
esther
how
absurd
why
you
a
better
actor
with
your
little
finger
than
any
one
of
them
with
their
whole
body
ah
but
they
do
know
that
yet
you
see
any
one
could
see
it
if
they
looked
at
your
face
i
wanted
to
play
the
part
of
snodgrass
but
they
could
think
of
giving
me
that
of
course
so
do
you
know
what
i
pretended
to
comfort
myself
i
pretended
i
was
edward
kean
waiting
in
the
passages
at
drury
lane
with
all
the
other
fine
fellows
looking
down
at
the
shabby
little
gloomy
man
from
the
provinces
that
was
conceit
for
you
was
it
the
pathos
of
this
was
of
course
irresistible
to
esther
and
mike
was
thereupon
hugged
and
kissed
as
he
expected
never
mind
he
said
you
see
if
i
do
make
something
of
the
poor
little
part
after
all
and
thereupon
he
described
what
he
laughingly
called
his
conception
and
how
he
proposed
to
dress
and
make
up
so
vividly
that
it
was
evident
that
the
boy
was
already
to
him
a
personality
whose
actions
and
interests
were
by
no
means
limited
to
his
brief
appearance
on
the
stage
but
who
though
accidentally
he
had
but
few
words
to
speak
before
the
audience
was
a
very
voluble
and
vital
little
person
in
scenes
where
the
audience
did
not
follow
him
yes
you
see
i
do
something
with
it
the
best
of
a
small
part
said
mike
speaking
as
one
of
experience
is
that
it
gives
you
plenty
of
opportunity
for
making
the
audience
wish
there
was
more
of
it
from
that
point
of
view
you
certainly
could
have
a
finer
part
laughed
esther
then
for
a
moment
mike
skipped
out
of
the
room
and
presently
knocked
and
putting
in
a
funny
face
entered
carrying
a
cushion
with
alacrity
that
a
pie
as
is
a
pie
is
that
there
pie
he
fooled
throwing
the
cushion
into
esther
lap
where
presently
his
little
red
head
found
its
way
too
how
can
you
love
such
a
silly
little
creature
he
said
looking
up
into
esther
blue
eyes
i
do
know
i
sure
said
esther
but
i
do
and
bending
down
she
kissed
the
wistful
boy
face
was
it
because
esther
was
in
a
way
his
mother
as
well
as
his
sweetheart
that
she
seemed
to
do
all
the
kissing
thus
was
mike
first
part
rehearsed
and
rewarded
chapter
xix
on
certain
advantages
of
a
backwater
though
from
a
maritime
point
of
view
tyre
was
perhaps
the
chief
centre
of
conjunction
for
all
the
main
streams
of
the
world
from
the
point
of
view
of
literature
and
any
other
art
it
was
an
admitted
backwater
take
what
art
you
pleased
tyre
was
a
dunce
even
to
music
the
most
persuasive
of
the
arts
it
was
deaf
surely
of
all
cities
it
had
not
been
built
to
music
it
possessed
indeed
one
who
insisted
on
presenting
it
with
nude
sculptures
and
mysterious
paintings
which
it
furiously
declined
if
tyre
was
to
be
artistically
great
it
must
certainly
be
with
a
greatness
reluctantly
thrust
upon
it
still
henry
and
ned
had
sense
enough
to
be
glad
that
they
had
been
born
there
it
was
from
no
mere
recognition
of
an
inexpensively
effective
background
perhaps
they
hardly
knew
why
they
were
glad
till
later
on
but
meanwhile
they
instinctively
laid
hold
of
the
advantages
of
their
limitations
had
they
been
and
they
would
have
been
much
more
fashionable
in
their
tastes
but
their
very
isolation
happily
saved
them
from
the
passing
superstitions
of
fashion
and
they
were
thus
able
to
enjoy
the
antiquities
of
beauty
with
the
same
freshness
of
appetite
as
though
they
had
been
novelties
if
henry
was
to
meet
ned
some
evening
with
the
announcement
that
he
had
a
wonderful
new
book
to
share
with
him
it
was
just
as
likely
to
be
sir
philip
astrophel
and
stella
as
any
more
recent
publication
though
indeed
they
contrived
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
literary
developments
of
the
day
with
a
remarkable
instinct
and
perhaps
a
juster
estimate
of
their
character
and
value
than
those
who
were
taking
part
in
them
for
it
is
seldom
that
one
can
be
in
the
movement
and
at
the
centre
as
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
little
that
interested
them
or
which
at
all
events
did
disappoint
and
somewhat
bewilder
the
novel
was
groaning
under
the
thraldom
of
realism
poetry
with
one
or
two
exceptions
was
given
up
to
and
metrical
ingenuity
to
young
men
for
whom
french
romanticism
was
still
alive
who
were
still
content
to
see
the
world
through
the
spiritual
eyes
of
shelley
and
keats
and
who
had
not
yet
learned
to
belittle
carlyle
there
seemed
a
strange
lack
of
generosity
and
indeed
vitality
in
the
literary
ideals
of
the
hour
the
novel
particularly
seemed
barren
and
unprofitable
to
them
more
and
more
an
instrument
of
science
than
a
branch
of
literature
laughter
had
deserted
it
as
clearly
as
romance
or
pathos
and
more
and
more
it
was
becoming
the
vehicle
of
cynical
biology
on
the
one
hand
and
unitarian
theology
on
the
other
besides
strangest
of
all
men
were
praised
for
lacking
those
very
qualities
which
to
these
boys
had
seemed
essential
to
literature
the
excellences
praised
were
the
excellences
of
science
not
literature
in
fact
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
excellence
namely
accuracy
of
observation
and
to
write
a
novel
with
any
eye
to
beauty
of
language
was
to
err
as
the
writer
of
a
scientific
treatise
would
err
who
endeavoured
to
add
charm
and
grace
to
the
sober
record
of
his
investigations
dull
sociological
analysts
reigned
in
the
once
laughing
domain
of
cervantes
of
fielding
and
thackeray
of
dumas
and
dickens
of
hugo
and
gautier
and
george
sand
were
they
born
too
late
were
they
anachronisms
from
the
forgotten
age
of
romanticism
or
were
they
just
born
in
time
to
assist
at
the
birth
of
another
romantic
idealistic
age
would
dreams
and
love
and
beautiful
writing
ever
come
into
fashion
again
would
the
poet
be
again
a
creature
of
passion
and
the
novelist
once
more
make
you
laugh
and
cry
and
would
there
be
essayists
any
more
whose
pages
you
would
mark
and
whose
phrases
you
would
roll
over
and
over
again
on
your
tongue
with
delight
at
some
mysterious
magic
in
the
words
history
may
be
held
to
have
answered
these
questions
since
then
much
in
favour
of
those
young
men
or
at
all
events
is
engaged
in
answering
them
but
meanwhile
what
a
miraculous
refreshment
in
a
dry
and
thirsty
land
was
the
new
book
henry
mesurier
had
just
discovered
and
had
eagerly
brought
to
share
with
ned
in
their
tavern
corner
one
summer
evening
in
ned
was
late
but
when
henry
had
sipped
a
little
at
his
port
and
turned
to
the
exquisite
pages
he
hardly
noticed
how
the
minutes
were
going
by
as
he
read
presently
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
first
volume
the
only
one
he
had
with
him
and
he
raised
his
eyes
from
the
closing
page
with
that
exquisite
exaltation
that
beatific
satisfaction
of
mind
and
spirit
even
almost
one
might
say
of
body
which
for
the
lover
of
literature
nothing
in
the
world
like
a
fine
passage
can
bring
he
turned
again
to
the
closing
sentences
what
was
wanting
was
the
heart
that
would
make
it
impossible
to
witness
all
this
and
the
future
would
be
with
the
forces
that
would
beget
a
heart
like
that
his
favourite
philosophy
had
said
trust
the
eye
strive
to
be
right
always
regarding
the
concrete
experience
never
falsify
your
impressions
and
its
sanction
had
been
at
least
effective
here
in
saying
it
is
what
i
may
not
see
surely
evil
was
a
real
thing
and
the
wise
man
wanting
in
the
sense
of
it
where
not
to
have
been
by
instinctive
election
on
the
right
side
was
to
have
failed
in
the
passage
referred
to
the
roman
gladiatorial
shows
and
to
the
philosophic
detachment
by
which
marcus
aurelius
was
able
to
see
and
yet
not
to
see
them
and
the
whole
book
was
the
spiritual
story
of
a
young
roman
soul
a
priestlike
artistic
temperament
born
in
the
haunted
twilight
between
the
setting
sun
of
pagan
religion
and
philosophy
and
the
dawn
of
the
christian
idea
the
theme
presented
many
fascinating
analogies
to
the
present
time
and
in
the
hero
sensations
and
ideas
henry
found
many
correspondences
with
his
own
nature
in
him
too
was
united
that
same
joy
in
the
sensuous
form
that
same
adoration
of
the
spiritual
mystery
the
temperaments
in
one
of
artist
and
priest
he
too
in
a
dim
fashion
indeed
and
under
conditions
of
culture
less
favourable
had
speculated
and
experimented
in
a
similar
manner
upon
the
literary
art
over
which
as
yet
he
had
acquired
how
crushingly
this
exquisite
book
taught
him
such
pathetically
uncertain
mastery
that
impassioned
comradeship
in
books
beautiful
was
it
not
ned
and
his
as
all
those
years
before
it
had
been
that
of
marius
and
flavian
and
where
in
the
world
ned
how
he
would
kindle
at
a
passage
like
this
keep
the
eye
clear
by
a
sort
of
exquisite
personal
alacrity
and
cleanliness
extending
even
to
his
to
discriminate
ever
more
and
more
exactly
select
form
and
colour
in
things
from
what
was
less
select
to
meditate
much
on
beautiful
visible
objects
on
objects
more
especially
connected
with
the
period
of
youth
on
children
at
play
in
the
morning
the
trees
in
early
spring
on
young
animals
on
the
fashions
and
amusements
of
young
men
to
keep
ever
by
him
if
it
were
but
a
single
choice
flower
a
graceful
animal
or
as
a
token
and
representation
of
the
whole
kingdom
of
such
things
to
avoid
jealously
in
his
way
through
the
world
everything
repugnant
to
sight
and
should
any
circumstance
tempt
him
to
a
general
converse
in
the
range
of
such
objects
to
disentangle
himself
from
that
circumstance
at
any
cost
of
place
money
or
opportunity
such
were
in
brief
outline
the
duties
recognised
the
rights
demanded
in
this
new
formula
of
and
again
what
gleaming
single
phrases
whole
counsels
of
existence
in
a
dozen
words
he
must
copy
out
some
of
them
for
esther
this

fulness

of

able

make

the
fruit
perhaps
was
useless

or
again

absolutely
virgin
towards
a
direct
and
concrete
and
there
were
a
hundred
more
then
for
the
young
craftsman
what
an
insight
into
what
a
compassionate
childish
remembrance
of
the
moods
and
the
little
foolish
accidents
of
creation
dilettanteism
his
assiduous
preoccupation
with
what
might
seem
but
the
details
of
mere
form
or
manner
was
after
all
bent
upon
the
function
of
bringing
to
the
surface
sincerely
and
in
their
integrity
certain
strong
personal
intuitions
certain
visions
or
apprehensions
of
things
as
being
with
important
results
in
this
way
rather
than
that
apprehensions
which
the
artistic
or
literary
expression
was
called
upon
to
follow
with
the
exactness
of
wax
or
clay
clothing
the
model

with
his
fine
clear
mastery
of
the

early
laid
hold
of
the
principle
as
axiomatic
in
literature
that
know
when
one
self
is
interested
is
the
first
condition
of
interesting
other
people
and
once
more
it
oftenest
happens
also
with
natures
of
genuinely
poetic
quality
those
piecemeal
beginnings
came
suddenly
to
harmonious
completeness
among
the
fortunate
incidents
the
physical
heat
and
light
of
one
singularly
happy
and
over
all
what

beauty
a
beauty
at
once
so
sensuous
and
so
spiritual

beauty

flowering

the
beauty
of
austerity
aflower

the
very
senses

surely
this
was
the
most
beautiful
prose
book
ever
written
it
had
been
compared
he
saw
with
gautier
mademoiselle
de
maupin
but
was
not
the
beauty
of
that
masterpiece
in
comparison
with
the
beauty
of
this
as
the
beauty
of
a
to
the
beauty
of
a
statue

in
a

still

delayed
and
meanwhile
the
third
glass
of

had
come
and
gone
and
at
length
reluctantly
henry
emerged
from
his
upon
the
warm
brilliancy
of
the
streets
all
around
him
the
lights
beaconed
and
the
women
called
with
bright
eyes
but
there
was
no
temptation
for
him
in
these
things
they
but
recalled
another
exquisite
quotation
from
his
treasure
which
he
stopped
under
a
lamp
to
fix
in
his
memory
as
the
fresh
rich
evening
came
on
there
was
heard
all
over
rome
far
above
a
whisper
the
whole
town
seeming
hushed
to
catch
it
distinctly
the
living
reckless
call
to
from
the
sons
and
daughters
of
foolishness

their
life

for
himself
slight
as
was
the
burden
of
positive
moral
obligation
with
which
he
had
entered
rome
it
was
to
no
wasteful
and

he
sat
bent
drearily
industrious
over
some
accounts
and
said
that
he
wished
him
in
time
to
go
with
him
to
a
new
client
and
presently
the
two
set
out
together
henry
wondering
what
it
was
to
be
and
welcoming
anything
that
even
exchanged
for
a
while
one
for
another
i
am
taking
you
said
the
old
man
as
they
walked
along
together
to
a
firm
of
carriers
and
carters
whose
affairs
have
just
come
into
our
hands
there
is
a
dispute
arisen
between
the
partners
we
represent
certain
interests
as
i
shall
presently
explain
to
you
and
you
are
to
be
representative
our
man
in
possession
and
the
old
gentleman
laughed
uncannily
you
never
expected
to
be
a
man
in
possession
did
you
henry
thrilled
with
a
sense
of
awful
intimacy
thus
walking
and
even
jesting
with
his
august
employer
it
may
very
likely
be
a
long
business
the
old
man
continued
and
i
fear
may
be
a
little
dull
for
you
for
you
must
be
on
the
spot
all
day
long
your
lunch
will
be
served
to
you
from
the
manager
house
i
will
see
to
that
actually
there
will
be
very
little
for
you
to
do
beyond
looking
over
the
and
receipts
for
the
day
the
main
thing
is
for
you
to
be
there
so
to
say
the
moral
effect
of
your
presence
and
the
old
gentleman
laughed
again
then
with
an
amused
sympathy
that
seemed
almost
exquisite
to
henry
he
chuckled
out
looking
at
him
from
one
corner
of
his
eye
like
a
roguish
skeleton
you
be
able
to
write
as
much
poetry
as
you
like
i
see
you
got
a
book
with
you
well
it
will
keep
you
awake
i
do
mind
that
or
even
the
poetry
so
long
as
you
do
forget
the
thank
you
sir
said
henry
almost
hysterically
i
suppose
the
old
man
continued
presently
and
in
all
he
said
there
was
a
tone
of
affectionate
banter
that
quite
won
henry
heart
that
you
still
as
set
on
literature
as
ever
well
well
far
be
it
from
me
to
discourage
you
but
my
dear
boy
you
find
out
that
we
ca
live
on
dreams
henry
thought
but
did
dare
to
say
that
it
was
dreams
alone
that
made
it
possible
to
live
at
all
i
suppose
you
think
i
a
old
fellow
enough
well
well
i
had
my
dreams
too
yes
i
had
my
dreams
henry
thought
of
what
he
had
discovered
that
day
in
the
old
man
diary
and
i
written
my
verses
to
my
eyebrow
in
my
time
too
ah
my
boy
we
are
all
young
and
foolish
once
in
our
lives
and
it
was
evident
what
a
narrow
and
desperate
escape
from
being
a
poet
the
old
man
had
had
they
had
some
distance
to
walk
for
the
stables
to
which
they
were
bound
were
situated
in
an
old
and
rather
disreputable
part
of
the
town
not
a
nice
quarter
said
lingard
not
particularly
salubrious
or
refined
as
bad
smells
and
dirty
women
began
to
cross
their
path
but
they
are
nice
people
you
got
to
deal
with
and
the
place
itself
is
clean
and
nice
enough
when
you
once
get
inside
here
we
are
he
said
presently
as
they
stopped
short
of
an
house
set
in
a
high
wall
which
seemed
to
enclose
quite
a
considerable
area
of
the
district
in
the
wall
a
yard
or
two
from
the
house
was
set
a
low
door
with
a
brass
at
the
side
which
answered
to
lingard
summons
with
a
clang
soon
was
heard
the
sound
of
boots
evidently
over
a
paved
yard
and
a
big
carter
admitted
them
to
the
enclosure
which
immediately
impressed
them
with
its
sense
of
country
cleanliness
and
its
country
smell
of
horses
and
provender
the
stones
of
the
courtyard
seemed
to
have
been
individually
washed
and
scoured
and
a
small
space
in
front
of
a
door
evidently
leading
to
the
house
was
chalked
over
in
the
prim
way
is
mr
flower
about
asked
lingard
and
as
he
asked
the
question
a
handsome
man
of
about
came
down
the
yard
it
was
a
massive
country
face
a
little
heavy
a
little
slow
but
exceptionally
gentle
and
refined
mr
lingard
mr
flower
this
is
our
representative
mesurier
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
to
you
i
sure
you
will
get
on
well
together
and
i
sure
he
will
give
you
as
little
trouble
as
possible
henry
and
mr
flower
shook
hands
and
as
men
sometimes
do
took
to
each
other
at
once
in
the
grasp
of
each
other
hands
and
the
glances
which
accompanied
it
then
the
three
walked
further
up
the
yard
to
the
little
office
where
henry
was
to
pass
the
next
few
weeks
and
as
lingard
turned
over
books
and
explained
to
henry
what
he
was
expected
to
do
the
sound
of
horses
kicking
their
stalls
and
rattling
chains
in
their
mangers
came
to
him
from
near
at
hand
with
a
delightful
echo
of
the
country
when
lingard
had
gone
mr
flower
asked
henry
if
he
care
to
look
at
the
horses
henry
sympathetically
consented
though
his
knowledge
of
hardly
equalled
his
knowledge
of
accounts
but
with
the
healthy
animal
in
whatever
form
one
always
feels
more
or
less
at
home
as
one
feels
at
home
with
the
green
earth
or
that
simple
creature
the
sea
mr
flower
led
the
way
to
a
long
stable
where
some
fifty
horses
protruded
brown
and
dappled
haunches
on
either
hand
it
was
all
wonderfully
clean
and
sweet
and
the
cobbled
pavement
the
straw
beds
the
hay
tumbling
in
bunches
into
the
stalls
from
the
loft
overhead
made
you
forget
that
around
this
bucolic
enclosure
swarmed
and
rotted
the
foulest
slums
of
the
city
garrets
where
coiners
plied
their
amateur
mints
and
cellars
where
murderers
lay
hidden
in
the
dark
it
like
a
breath
of
the
country
said
henry
unconsciously
striking
the
right
note
you
right
there
said
mr
flower
at
the
same
moment
heartily
slapping
the
shining
side
of
a
big
chestnut
mare
after
the
approved
manner
of
men
who
love
horses
to
thus
belabour
a
horse
on
its
would
seem
to
be
equivalent
among
the
fraternity
to
chucking
a
buxom
milkmaid
under
the
chin
you
right
there
he
said
and
here
a
good
derbyshire
lass
for
you
once
more
administering
a
sounding
caress
upon
his
sleek
favourite
the
horse
turned
its
head
and
whinnied
softly
at
the
attention
and
it
was
evident
it
loved
the
very
sound
of
mr
flower
voice
have
you
ever
been
to
derbyshire
asked
mr
flower
presently
and
henry
immediately
scented
an
idealism
in
the
question
no
he
answered
but
i
believe
it
a
beautiful
county
beautiful
no
name
for
it
said
mr
flower
it
just
a
garden
and
as
henry
caught
a
glance
of
his
eyes
he
realised
that
derbyshire
was
mr
flower
poetry
the
poetry
of
a
countryman
imprisoned
in
the
town
and
that
when
he
died
he
just
hoped
to
go
to
derbyshire
ah
there
are
places
there
places
like
miller
dale
for
instance
i
rather
take
my
hat
off
to
than
any
bishop
and
henry
eagerly
scented
something
of
a
thinker
for
god
made
them
for
sure
and
bishops
well
and
mr
flower
wisely
left
the
rest
unsaid
thus
they
made
the
tour
of
the
stables
and
though
henry
remarks
on
the
subject
of
slapped
had
been
anything
but
those
of
an
expert
it
was
tacitly
agreed
that
mr
flower
and
he
had
taken
to
each
other
nor
as
he
presently
found
were
mr
flower
interests
limited
to
horses
you
a
reader
i
see
he
said
presently
when
they
had
returned
to
the
office
well
i
do
get
much
time
to
read
nowadays
but
nothing
i
enjoy
better
when
i
got
a
pipe
lit
of
an
evening
than
to
sit
and
listen
to
my
little
daughter
reading
thackeray
or
george
eliot
of
course
henry
was
interested
now
there
was
a
woman
who
knew
country
life
mr
flower
continued
marner
or
bede
how
wonderfully
she
gets
at
the
very
heart
of
the
people
and
not
only
that
but
the
very
smell
of
country
air
and
mr
flower
drew
a
long
breath
of
longing
for
miller
dale
henry
mentally
furbished
up
his
george
eliot
to
reply
and
mill
on
the
floss
he
said
and
from
clerical
life
said
mr
flower
there
are
some
rare
strokes
of
nature
there
and
so
they
went
on
comparing
notes
till
a
little
girl
of
about
seventeen
appeared
carrying
a
dainty
lunch
for
henry
and
telling
mr
flower
that
his
own
lunch
was
ready
this
is
my
daughter
of
whom
i
spoke
said
mr
flower
she
who
reads
thackeray
and
george
eliot
to
you
said
the
man
in
possession
and
when
they
had
gone
he
said
to
himself
what
a
bright
little
face
chapter
xxi
little
miss
flower
little
miss
flower
continued
to
bring
henry
his
lunch
with
great
punctuality
each
day
and
each
day
he
found
himself
more
and
more
interested
in
its
arrival
though
when
it
had
come
he
ate
it
with
no
special
haste
indeed
sometimes
it
almost
seemed
that
it
had
served
its
purpose
in
merely
having
been
brought
judging
by
the
moments
of
reverie
in
which
henry
seemed
to
have
forgotten
it
and
to
be
thinking
of
something
else
yes
he
had
soon
begun
to
watch
for
that
bright
little
face
and
it
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
for
particularly
come
upon
against
such
a
background
the
face
had
something
of
the
surprise
of
an
apparition
it
seemed
all
made
of
light
and
when
one
had
come
and
henry
heard
the
expected
footsteps
of
his
little
and
the
tinkle
of
the
tray
she
carried
coming
up
the
yard
her
entrance
was
as
though
some
one
had
carried
a
lamp
into
the
dark
office
surely
it
was
more
like
the
face
of
a
spirit
than
that
of
a
little
human
girl
and
you
would
almost
have
expected
it
to
shine
in
the
dark
when
you
got
used
to
the
light
of
it
you
realised
that
the
radiance
poured
from
singularly
even
disproportionately
large
blue
eyes
set
beneath
a
broad
white
brow
of
great
purity
and
that
what
at
first
had
seemed
rays
of
light
around
her
head
was
a
mass
of
sunny
hair
which
glinted
even
in
shadow
strange
indeed
are
the
vagaries
of
the
spirit
of
beauty
from
how
many
high
places
will
she
turn
away
yet
delight
to
waste
herself
upon
a
slum
like
this
how
fantastic
the
accident
that
had
brought
such
a
face
to
flower
in
such
a
spot
and
yet
hardly
more
fantastic
he
reflected
than
that
which
had
sown
his
own
family
haphazard
where
they
were
was
it
the
ironic
fate
of
power
to
be
always
a
god
in
exile
turning
mean
wheels
with
mighty
hands
and
was
cinderella
the
fable
of
the
eternal
lot
of
beauty
in
this
capriciously
ordered
world
yes
what
chance
wind
blowing
all
the
way
from
derbyshire
had
set
down
mr
flower
with
his
little
garden
of
girls
in
this
uncongenial
spot
for
by
this
henry
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
whole
family
and
mrs
flower
and
four
daughters
in
all
all
pretty
girls
but
not
one
of
the
others
with
a
face
like
that
which
was
another
puzzle
how
is
it
that
out
of
one
family
one
will
be
chosen
by
the
spirit
of
beauty
or
genius
and
the
others
so
unmistakably
left
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
whom
had
been
chosen
here
one
day
the
step
coming
up
the
yard
at
one
seemed
to
be
different
and
when
the
door
opened
it
was
another
sister
who
had
brought
his
lunch
that
day
her
eldest
sister
was
ill
she
explained
and
in
bed
and
it
was
so
for
the
next
day
and
again
the
next
could
it
be
possible
that
henry
had
watched
so
eagerly
for
that
little
face
that
he
missed
it
so
much
already
the
next
morning
he
bought
some
roses
on
his
way
through
town
and
begged
that
they
might
be
allowed
to
brighten
her
room
and
the
next
day
surely
it
was
the
same
light
little
tread
once
more
coming
up
the
yard
joy
she
was
better
again
she
looked
pale
he
said
anxiously
and
ventured
to
say
too
that
he
had
missed
her
as
she
blushed
and
looked
down
he
saw
that
she
wore
one
of
his
roses
in
her
bosom
he
had
already
begun
to
lend
her
books
which
she
returned
always
with
some
clever
little
criticism
often
girlishly
naïve
but
never
merely
conventional
there
were
brains
under
her
bright
hair
one
day
henry
had
run
out
of
literature
and
asked
her
if
she
could
lend
him
a
book
anything
some
novel
he
had
read
before
it
did
matter
oh
yes
he
had
read
george
eliot
for
ever
so
long
had
she
the
mill
on
the
floss
yes
it
had
been
a
present
from
her
father
she
would
bring
that
as
she
lingered
a
moment
while
henry
looked
at
the
book
his
eye
fell
upon
a
name
on
the
angel
flower
is
that
your
name
miss
flower
he
said
yes
father
wrote
it
there
my
real
name
is
angelica
but
they
call
me
angel
for
short
she
answered
smiling
are
you
surprised
said
henry
suddenly
blushing
like
a
girl
as
though
he
had
never
ventured
on
such
a
small
gallantry
before
angelica
how
did
you
come
to
get
such
a
beautiful
name
father
loves
beautiful
names
and
his
grandmother
was
called
angelica
i
wonder
if
i
might
call
you
angelica
presently
ventured
henry
in
a
low
voice
do
you
think
you
know
me
well
enough
said
angelica
with
a
little
gasp
which
was
really
joy
in
her
breath
henry
did
answer
but
their
eyes
met
in
a
long
still
look
in
each
heart
behind
the
stillness
was
a
storm
of
indescribable
sweetness
henry
leaned
forward
his
face
grown
very
pale
and
impulsively
took
angelica
hand
i
think
after
all
i
rather
call
you
angel
he
said
chapter
xxii
mike
first
laurels
the
gardens
of
sidon
had
a
curious
habit
of
growing
laurels
and
rhododendrons
were
the
only
wear
in
shrubs
rhododendrons
one
can
understand
they
are
to
the
garden
what
mahogany
is
to
the
front
parlour
the
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
but
the
laurel
what
use
could
they
have
for
laurel
in
sidon
possibly
they
supplied
it
to
the
rest
of
the
world
so
to
say
to
the
temple
of
fame
it
could
hardly
be
for
home
consumption
well
at
all
events
it
was
a
peculiarity
fortunate
for
esther
purpose
as
one
morning
soon
after
breakfast
she
went
about
the
garden
cutting
the
glossiest
branches
of
the
distinguished
tree
as
she
filled
her
arms
with
them
she
recalled
with
a
smile
the
different
purpose
for
which
dragged
at
the
heels
of
one
of
henry
enthusiasms
she
had
gathered
them
several
years
before
at
that
period
henry
had
been
a
mighty
entomologist
and
as
the
late
summer
came
on
he
and
all
available
sisters
would
set
out
armed
with
and
other
paraphernalia
just
before
twilight
to
the
nearest
woodland
where
they
would
proceed
to
daub
the
trees
with
an
intoxicating
preparation
of
honey
and
rum
a
temptation
to
which
moths
were
declared
in
to
be
incapable
of
resistance
then
as
night
fell
henry
would
light
his
and
cautiously
visit
the
various
snares
it
was
a
sight
worth
seeing
to
come
upon
those
little
of
drunken
and
bewildered
moths
hanging
on
to
the
sweetness
with
tragic
gluttony
an
easy
prey
for
henry
eager
fingers
which
as
greedy
of
them
as
they
of
the
honey
would
seize
and
thrust
them
into
the
lethal
chamber
in
the
form
of
a
loosely
filled
with
bruised
laurel
leaves
which
hung
by
a
strap
from
his
shoulder
it
was
for
such
exciting
employment
that
esther
had
once
gathered
laurel
leaves
and
once
again
she
remembered
gathering
them
one
birthday
to
crown
a
little
bust
in
henry
study
the
sacred
head
had
worn
them
proudly
all
day
and
they
all
had
a
feeling
that
somehow
shakespeare
must
know
about
it
and
appreciate
the
little
offering
just
as
even
one
might
bring
roses
and
myrtle
or
the
blood
of
a
maiden
dove
to
venus
and
expect
her
to
smile
upon
our
affairs
of
the
heart
but
it
was
for
a
dearer
purpose
that
esther
was
gathering
them
this
morning
that
coming
evening
mike
was
to
utter
his
first
in
public
the
laurel
was
to
crown
the
occasion
on
which
mike
was
to
make
that
memorable
utterance
that
a
pie
as
is
a
pie
is
that
there
pie
now
while
esther
was
busily
weaving
this
laurel
into
a
wreath
henry
was
busily
weaving
the
best
words
he
could
find
into
a
sonnet
to
accompany
the
wreath
when
angel
duly
brought
him
his
lunch
it
was
finished
and
lay
about
on
his
desk
in
rags
and
tatters
of
composition
angel
was
going
to
the
performance
with
her
sisters
for
all
these
young
people
were
fond
of
advertising
each
other
and
he
had
soon
told
her
about
mike
so
she
was
interested
to
hear
the
sonnet
whatever
other
qualities
poetry
may
lack
the
presence
of
generous
sincerity
will
always
give
it
a
certain
value
to
all
but
the
merely
supercilious
and
this
sonnet
boyish
in
its
touches
of
grandiloquence
had
yet
a
certain
pathos
of
strong
feeling
about
it
not
unto
him
alone
whom
loud
acclaim
declares
the
victor
does
the
meed
belong
for
others
standing
silent
in
the
throng
may
well
be
worthier
of
a
nobler
fame
and
so
dear
friend
although
unknown
thy
name
unto
the
shouting
herd
we
would
give
tongue
to
our
deep
thought
and
the
world
great
among
by
this
symbolic
laurel
thee
proclaim
and
if
perchance
the
herd
shall
find
thee
out
in
coming
time
and
many
a
nobler
crown
to
one
they
love
to
honour
gladly
throw
wilt
thou
not
turn
thee
from
their
eager
shout
and
whisper
these
leaves
then
sere
and
brown
late
o
world
love
knew
it
long
ago
the
reader
will
probably
agree
with
angel
in
considering
the
last
line
the
best
but
of
course
she
thought
the
whole
was
wonderful
how
wonderful
it
must
be
to
be
able
to
write
she
said
with
a
look
in
her
face
which
was
worth
all
the
books
ever
written
and
how
wonderful
even
to
have
something
written
to
one
like
that
surely
that
must
have
happened
to
you
said
henry
slyly
you
only
laughing
at
me
no
i
not
you
do
know
what
may
have
been
written
to
you
poems
may
quite
well
have
been
written
to
you
without
your
having
heard
of
them
the
poet
may
have
thought
them
worthy
of
you
what
nonsense
why
i
do
know
any
poets
oh
said
henry
i
mean
except
you
and
how
do
you
know
that
i
have
written
a
whole
book
full
of
poems
to
you
i
known
you
how
long
now
two
months
next
monday
said
angel
with
that
chronological
accuracy
on
such
matters
which
seems
to
be
a
special
gift
of
women
in
love
men
in
love
are
nothing
like
so
accurate
well
that
long
enough
is
it
and
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
you
know
but
you
do
care
enough
about
me
you
never
know
but
tell
me
really
have
you
written
something
for
me
ah
you
like
to
know
now
would
you
of
course
i
would
tell
me
it
would
make
me
very
happy
it
really
would
you
know
it
would
but
why
it
would
but
you
could
care
for
the
poetry
unless
you
cared
for
the
poet
oh
i
do
know
poetry
poetry
is
it
whoever
makes
it
but
what
if
i
did
care
a
little
for
the
poet
do
you
mean
you
do
angel
ah
you
want
to
know
now
do
you
tell
me
do
tell
me
i
tell
you
when
you
read
me
my
poem
and
as
angel
prepared
to
run
off
with
a
laugh
henry
called
after
her
you
will
really
it
a
bargain
yes
it
a
bargain
she
called
back
as
she
tripped
off
again
down
the
yard
mike
was
as
great
a
success
as
so
small
a
part
could
make
it
and
the
main
point
about
it
was
the
excitement
of
knowing
that
this
was
an
actual
beginning
he
had
made
them
all
laugh
and
cry
in
for
ever
so
long
but
he
was
on
the
stage
the
real
stage
real
at
all
events
for
him
for
mike
could
never
be
an
amateur
esther
eyes
filled
with
glad
tears
as
the
little
figure
popped
in
with
a
baker
paper
hat
on
his
head
and
delivered
the
absurd
words
and
if
you
had
looked
at
henry
face
too
you
would
have
been
at
a
loss
to
know
which
loved
the
little
boy
best
when
mike
returned
to
his
a
mysterious
box
was
awaiting
him
he
opened
it
and
found
esther
wreath
and
henry
sonnet
god
bless
them
he
said
no
doubt
it
was
very
childish
and
sentimental
and
but
these
young
people
certainly
loved
each
other
as
mike
had
left
the
stage
henry
had
turned
round
and
smiled
at
some
one
a
few
seats
away
esther
had
noticed
him
and
looked
in
the
same
direction
who
was
that
you
bowed
to
henry
i
tell
you
another
time
he
said
for
he
had
a
good
deal
to
tell
her
about
angel
flower
chapter
xxiii
the
mother
of
an
angel
the
man
in
possession
was
becoming
more
and
more
a
favourite
at
mr
flower
one
day
mr
flower
taking
pity
on
his
loneliness
suggested
that
he
might
possibly
prefer
to
have
his
lunch
in
company
with
them
all
down
at
the
house
henry
gladly
embraced
the
proposal
and
thus
became
the
daily
honoured
guest
of
a
family
each
member
of
which
had
some
simple
human
attraction
for
him
he
had
already
won
the
heart
of
simple
mrs
flower
few
and
brief
as
had
been
his
encounters
with
her
and
that
heart
she
had
several
times
coined
in
unexpected
cakes
and
other
dainties
of
her
own
making
but
when
he
thus
became
partially
domiciled
with
the
family
she
was
his
slave
outright
there
was
a
reason
for
this
which
will
need
and
may
perhaps
excuse
a
few
lines
entirely
devoted
to
mrs
flower
who
on
her
own
peculiar
merits
deserves
them
perhaps
to
introduce
eliza
flower
in
this
way
is
to
take
her
more
seriously
than
any
of
her
affectionate
acquaintance
were
able
to
do
for
somehow
people
had
a
bad
habit
of
laughing
at
mrs
flower
though
they
admitted
she
was
the
little
housewife
in
the
world
housewife
in
fact
she
was
not
to
say
no
little
woman
who
worked
herself
to
to
keep
things
straight
and
the
home
comfortable
was
ever
a
more
typical
squaw
whatever
her
religious
opinions
which
one
may
be
sure
were
inflexibly
orthodox
there
can
be
no
question
that
mr
flower
was
her
god
and
as
the
hymn
says
heaven
was
her
home
to
serve
god
and
mr
flower
were
to
her
the
same
thing
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
a
god
who
had
no
socks
to
darn
or
linen
to
keep
spotless
was
a
god
whom
mrs
flower
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
conceive
a
more
complete
and
delighted
absorption
in
the
physical
comforts
and
nourishments
of
the
human
creature
than
mrs
flower
it
would
be
impossible
for
dreamer
to
imagine
such
an
absolute
adjustment
between
a
being
of
presumably
infinite
aspirations
and
immortal
discontents
and
its
environment
is
a
happiness
seldom
encountered
by
philosophers
to
think
of
death
for
poor
mrs
flower
was
to
conceive
a
homelessness
peculiarly
pathetic
unless
indeed
there
are
kitcheners
to
superintend
beds
to
make
rooms
to
turn
out
and
four
a
year
in
heaven
of
what
use
else
was
the
bewildering
gift
of
immortality
to
one
who
was
touchingly
mortal
in
all
her
tastes
indeed
henry
used
to
say
that
mrs
flower
was
the
most
convincing
argument
against
the
immortality
of
the
soul
that
he
had
ever
met
yet
though
it
was
quite
evident
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
else
she
cared
so
much
to
do
and
though
indeed
it
was
equally
evident
that
she
was
one
of
the
little
creatures
in
the
world
she
did
not
deny
herself
a
certain
more
or
less
constant
asperity
of
reference
to
occupations
which
kept
her
on
her
feet
from
morning
till
night
and
made
her
the
slave
of
the
whole
house
in
spite
of
four
big
idle
daughters
and
she
with
rheumatism
too
so
bad
that
she
could
hardly
get
up
and
down
stairs
probably
nothing
so
much
as
henry
respectful
sympathy
for
this
immemorial
rheumatism
had
contributed
to
win
mrs
flower
heart
as
to
the
precise
amount
of
rheumatism
from
which
mrs
flower
suffered
henry
soon
realised
that
there
seemed
to
be
an
irreverent
scepticism
in
the
family
nothing
short
of
heartless
for
rheumatism
so
poignantly
expressive
so
movingly
dramatised
he
never
remembered
to
have
met
mrs
flower
could
not
walk
across
the
floor
without
grimaces
of
pain
or
piteous
indrawings
of
her
breath
and
yet
demonstrations
that
you
might
have
thought
would
have
softened
stones
left
her
unfeeling
audience
not
only
unmoved
but
apparently
even
unobservant
from
sheer
decency
henry
would
flute
out
something
to
show
that
her
suffering
was
not
lost
on
him
but
it
is
to
be
feared
the
young
ones
would
only
wink
at
each
other
at
this
sign
of
unsophistication
oh
you
unfeeling
child
mrs
flower
would
exclaim
as
sometimes
she
caught
them
exchanging
comments
in
this
way
and
your
father
there
is
just
as
bad
she
would
say
impatient
to
provoke
somebody
this
remark
would
probably
prompt
mr
flower
to
the
indulgence
of
a
form
of
matrimonial
banter
which
was
not
unlike
the
endearments
he
bestowed
upon
his
horses
and
which
when
you
knew
that
he
loved
the
little
quaint
woman
with
all
his
heart
you
were
able
to
translate
into
more
customary
modes
of
affection
yes
indeed
he
would
say
it
evidently
time
i
was
looking
out
for
some
active
young
woman
eliza
when
you
begin
limping
about
like
that
it
a
pity
but
the
best
of
us
must
wear
out
some
day
this
superficially
heartless
pleasantry
he
would
deliver
with
a
sweeping
wink
at
henry
and
his
four
girls
but
mrs
flower
would
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
for
humour
was
not
her
strong
point
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
ralph
she
said
before
the
children
i
was
once
young
and
active
enough
to
take
your
fancy
anyhow
mesurier
wo
you
have
a
little
more
spinach
do
it
fresh
from
the
country
this
morning
you
must
mind
mr
flower
he
fond
of
his
joke
and
whatever
he
likes
to
say
he
get
on
pretty
badly
without
his
old
eliza
gracious
no
mr
flower
would
retort
do
flatter
yourself
old
girl
i
got
my
eye
on
two
or
three
fine
young
women
who
be
glad
of
the
job
i
assure
you
but
this
perhaps
proving
too
much
for
poor
mrs
flower
whose
tears
were
never
far
away
and
apt
to
require
he
would
change
his
tone
in
an
instant
and
say
dropping
into
his
derbyshire
thous
nonsense
lass
ca
thee
take
a
bit
of
a
joke
come
now
come
be
silly
thou
knowest
well
enough
what
thou
art
to
me
and
so
do
the
girls
see
let
have
a
drive
out
to
livingstone
cemetery
this
afternoon
a
bit
out
o
sorts
it
cheer
thee
up
a
bit
and
so
mrs
flower
would
recover
and
harmony
would
be
restored
and
nobody
would
wink
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
certainly
it
was
a
quaint
little
mother
for
an
angel
chapter
xxiv
an
ancient
theory
of
heaven
when
are
you
going
to
read
me
my
poem
said
angelica
one
day
when
are
you
going
to
tell
me
what
i
asked
replied
henry
whenever
you
read
me
my
poem
retorted
angelica
all
right
when
would
you
like
to
hear
it
now
but
i
have
got
it
with
me
ca
you
remember
it
no
not
when
will
you
bring
it
i
tell
you
what
come
with
me
to
woodside
meadows
on
saturday
afternoon
your
father
wo
mind
oh
no
father
likes
you
i
glad
because
i
very
fond
of
him
yes
he
a
dear
and
he
got
far
more
in
him
than
perhaps
you
think
under
his
country
ways
if
you
could
see
him
in
the
country
it
would
make
you
cry
he
loves
it
so
yes
i
could
tell
that
by
the
way
he
talked
of
derbyshire
the
first
day
we
met
but
you
come
on
saturday
yes
i
come
angel
yes
it
was
the
face
of
an
angel
but
bright
as
it
had
seemed
on
that
dark
background
it
seemed
almost
brighter
still
as
it
moved
by
henry
side
among
the
green
lanes
he
had
never
known
angel
till
then
never
known
what
primal
ecstasy
her
nature
was
capable
of
in
the
town
her
soul
was
like
a
flame
in
a
lamp
of
pearl
here
in
the
country
it
was
like
a
star
in
a
vase
of
dew
to
be
near
trees
to
touch
their
rough
barks
to
fill
one
hands
with
green
leaves
to
hear
birds
to
listen
to
running
water
to
look
up
into
the
sky
oh
this
was
to
come
home
and
angel
joy
in
these
things
was
that
of
some
who
you
might
expect
any
moment
like
undine
to
slip
out
of
your
hands
in
some
laughing
brook
or
change
to
a
shower
of
blossom
over
your
head
oh
how
good
the
country
is
i
wish
father
were
here
i
could
eat
the
grass
and
i
just
want
to
take
the
sky
in
my
arms
as
she
swept
across
meadow
and
through
woodland
with
the
eagerness
of
a
child
greedily
hastening
from
room
to
room
of
some
inexhaustible
palace
her
little
tense
body
seemed
like
a
transparent
garment
fluttering
round
the
flying
feet
of
her
soul
at
length
she
flung
herself
down
almost
breathless
at
the
grassy
foot
of
a
great
tree
i
suppose
you
think
i
mad
she
said
and
really
i
think
i
must
be
for
why
should
mere
green
grass
and
blue
sky
and
a
few
birds
make
one
so
happy
why
should
anything
make
us
happy
or
sad
but
now
you
going
to
read
my
poem
she
said
presently
yes
but
something
has
to
happen
before
i
can
read
it
said
henry
growing
unaccountably
serious
for
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
prophecy
or
at
all
events
of
an
anticipation
you
have
to
fulfil
that
prophecy
first
it
seems
to
me
a
very
mysterious
poem
but
what
have
i
to
do
i
do
know
whether
you
can
do
it
well
what
is
it
try
me
oh
angel
i
care
nothing
about
poems
ca
you
see
how
i
love
you
that
all
poetry
will
ever
mean
to
me
just
to
say
over
and
over
again
love
angel
just
to
find
new
and
wonderful
ways
of
saying
that
listen
henry
i
loved
you
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
you
that
day
talking
to
father
and
i
shall
love
you
till
i
die
dear
dear
angel
henry
then
henry
arms
enfolded
angel
with
wonderful
love
and
her
fresh
young
lips
were
on
his
and
the
world
faded
away
like
a
dream
within
a
dream
now
perhaps
you
can
read
me
your
poem
said
angel
after
a
while
and
she
noticed
a
curious
something
different
in
her
way
of
speaking
to
him
as
in
his
way
of
speaking
to
her
something
blissfully
homelike
as
it
were
as
though
they
had
sat
like
this
for
ever
and
ever
and
were
quite
used
to
it
though
at
the
same
time
it
remained
thrillingly
new
it
only
a
silly
little
childish
rhyme
said
henry
some
day
write
you
far
better
then
coming
close
to
angel
he
whispered
this
is
angelica
fallen
from
heaven
fallen
from
heaven
into
my
arms
will
you
go
back
again
little
angelica
back
up
to
heaven
out
of
my
arms
no
said
angelica
here
is
my
heaven
here
is
my
heaven
here
in
your
arms
not
out
of
heaven
but
into
my
heaven
here
have
i
fallen
here
in
your
arms
chapter
xxv
the
last
continued
after
a
brief
interval
after
the
long
happy
silence
which
followed
henry
recitation
of
his
verses
angel
at
length
spoke
shall
i
tell
something
now
she
said
i
almost
ashamed
to
for
i
know
you
laugh
at
me
and
call
me
superstitious
go
on
little
child
said
henry
you
remember
the
day
said
angel
in
a
hushed
little
impressive
voice
i
first
saw
you
in
father
office
henry
was
able
to
remember
it
well
that
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
seen
you
really
angel
why
did
you
tell
me
before
where
was
it
then
in
the
street
or
where
no
it
was
much
stranger
than
that
said
angel
do
you
believe
the
future
can
be
foretold
to
us
oh
it
was
in
a
dream
you
funny
angel
was
that
it
said
henry
whose
rationalism
at
this
period
was
the
chief
danger
to
his
imagination
no
not
a
dream
something
stranger
than
that
oh
well
i
give
it
up
it
was
like
this
angel
continued
there
a
strange
old
gipsy
woman
who
lives
near
us
oh
i
see
your
hand
palmistry
said
henry
with
a
touch
of
gentle
impatience
henry
dear
i
said
you
would
laugh
at
me
i
wo
tell
you
now
if
you
going
to
take
it
in
that
spirit
henry
promptly
locked
up
his
reason
for
the
moment
with
apologies
and
professed
himself
open
to
conviction
well
mother
sometimes
helps
this
poor
old
woman
and
one
day
when
she
happened
to
call
alice
and
edith
and
i
were
in
the
kitchen
helping
mother
bless
you
lady
she
said
you
know
how
they
talk
got
a
kind
heart
and
how
are
all
the
young
ladies
time
i
thinking
they
had
their
fortunes
told
yes
we
all
said
us
our
fortunes
mother
we
always
called
her
mother
tell
you
yours
my
dear
she
said
taking
hold
of
my
hand
fortunes
are
too
young
yet
ladies
she
said
to
alice
and
edith
to
me
in
a
year
time
and
maybe
i
tell
you
all
about
him
you
dear
said
henry
by
way
of
interruption
then
continued
angel
she
took
me
aside
and
looked
at
my
hand
and
she
told
me
first
what
had
happened
to
me
and
then
what
was
to
come
what
she
told
me
of
the
past
as
if
dear
angel
whose
life
was
as
yet
all
future
could
as
yet
have
had
any
past
to
speak
of
was
so
true
that
i
could
help
half
believing
in
what
she
said
of
the
future
now
you
laughing
again
no
indeed
i
not
said
henry
perfectly
solemn
she
told
me
that
just
before
i
was
twenty
i
would
meet
a
young
man
with
dark
hair
and
blue
eyes
very
unexpectedly
i
shall
be
twenty
in
six
weeks
and
that
he
would
be
my
fate
but
the
strangest
is
yet
to
come
you
like
to
see
his
face
she
said
she
made
me
a
little
frightened
but
of
course
i
said
and
then
she
brought
out
of
her
pocket
a
sort
of
glass
egg
and
told
me
to
look
in
it
and
tell
her
what
i
saw
so
i
looked
but
for
a
long
time
i
could
see
nothing
but
suddenly
there
seemed
to
be
something
moving
in
the
centre
of
the
glass
like
clouds
breaking
when
the
sun
is
coming
out
and
presently
i
could
see
a
lamp
burning
on
a
table
and
then
round
the
lamp
shelves
of
books
began
to
grow
out
of
the
mist
then
i
saw
a
picture
hanging
in
a
recess
a
bowed
head
with
a
strange
sort
of
on
it
a
dark
thin
face
very
why
that
must
have
been
my
dante
said
henry
astonished
in
spite
of
himself
the
exclamation
was
a
score
for
angel
and
she
continued
with
greater
confidence
and
then
i
seemed
to
see
some
one
sitting
there
but
though
i
tried
and
tried
i
could
catch
sight
of
his
face
i
told
the
old
woman
what
i
saw
a
minute
she
said
try
again
so
i
waited
and
presently
tried
again
this
time
i
had
so
long
to
wait
before
i
saw
a
room
again
but
it
was
quite
different
a
big
desk
ran
along
in
front
of
a
window
and
there
were
two
tall
it
father
office
i
said
on
looking
said
the
old
woman
tell
me
what
you
see
in
a
moment
or
two
i
saw
some
one
sitting
on
one
of
the
stools
first
dimly
and
then
clearer
and
clearer
i
almost
cried
out
for
i
felt
more
and
more
frightened
see
a
young
man
sitting
at
a
desk
with
a
pen
behind
his
ear
you
see
him
clearly
i
said
got
dark
curly
hair
and
blue
eyes
sure
you
wo
forget
his
face
you
know
him
if
you
saw
him
again
i
would
i
said
right
said
the
old
woman
can
give
me
back
the
crystal
you
keep
a
look
out
for
that
young
man
you
will
see
him
some
day
mark
my
words
and
that
young
man
will
be
your
fate
now
surely
you
wo
deny
that
was
strange
will
you
asked
angel
in
conclusion
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
start
it
gave
me
that
day
when
i
came
in
quite
unsuspecting
with
your
and
saw
you
talking
to
father
with
your
pen
behind
your
ear
and
your
blue
eyes
and
dark
hair
now
is
it
strange
how
can
one
help
being
superstitious
after
a
thing
like
that
are
you
quite
sure
it
was
i
henry
asked
quizzically
it
appears
to
me
that
any
presentable
young
man
with
a
pen
behind
his
ear
would
have
answered
nearly
enough
to
the
vision
you
would
hardly
have
been
quite
sure
of
the
colour
of
the
eyes
would
you
now
if
the
old
woman
mentioned
it
first
as
she
looked
at
your
hand
you
are
horrid
said
angel
i
wish
i
had
told
you
now
but
it
was
merely
the
colour
of
the
eyes
it
was
the
look
in
them
look
again
and
see
if
you
have
made
a
mistake
look
very
carefully
said
henry
i
wo
said
angel
i
think
you
cruel
angel
if
you
only
look
and
say
you
are
quite
sure
i
believe
every
word
the
old
woman
said
at
last
angel
was
persuaded
to
look
and
to
look
again
and
the
old
woman
credit
rose
at
each
look
yes
henry
whatever
happens
i
know
it
is
true
my
life
is
in
your
hands
those
are
solemn
words
for
one
human
being
to
hear
uttered
by
another
and
a
shiver
of
new
responsibility
involuntarily
ran
through
henry
veins
may
the
hands
be
always
strong
and
clean
enough
to
hold
so
precious
a
gift
he
answered
gravely
are
you
sad
dear
asked
angel
presently
with
a
sort
of
divination
not
sad
dear
but
serious
he
answered
have
i
turned
to
a
responsibility
so
soon
you
strange
wise
child
i
believe
you
are
a
witch
oh
i
was
right
then
right
in
one
way
but
perhaps
wrong
in
another
do
you
know
that
some
responsibilities
are
the
most
dearly
coveted
of
mortal
honours
but
then
we
should
be
worthy
of
them
if
they
did
make
us
feel
a
little
serious
ca
you
imagine
that
to
hear
another
say
that
her
life
is
in
one
hands
makes
one
feel
just
a
little
solemn
but
is
your
life
in
mine
henry
asked
angel
simply
of
course
it
is
dear
answered
henry
and
then
the
moon
began
to
rise
through
the
trees
pouring
enchantment
over
the
sleeping
woods
and
the
meadows
in
lakes
of
mist
angel
drew
close
to
henry
and
watched
it
with
big
eyes
what
a
wonderful
world
it
is
how
beautiful
and
how
sad
she
said
half
to
herself
yes
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
so
sad
as
beauty
answered
henry
if
only
could
last
forever
if
only
we
could
die
now
sitting
just
like
this
with
the
moon
rising
yonder
but
we
shall
have
many
nights
like
this
together
said
henry
no
we
shall
never
have
this
night
again
we
may
have
other
wonderful
nights
but
they
will
be
different
this
will
never
come
again
henry
instinctively
realised
that
here
was
a
mystical
side
to
nature
which
however
it
might
charm
him
was
not
to
be
indiscriminately
encouraged
and
he
tried
to
rally
her
out
of
her
sadness
but
her
feeling
was
too
much
his
own
for
him
to
persist
and
as
the
moonlight
moved
in
its
ascension
from
one
beautiful
change
to
another
now
woven
by
branches
and
leaves
into
weird
tapestries
of
light
and
darkness
now
hanging
like
some
golden
fruit
from
the
boughs
and
now
uplifted
like
a
lamp
in
some
window
of
space
they
sat
together
alike
held
by
the
ancient
spell
and
presently
henry
so
far
lost
himself
in
it
as
to
quote
some
lines
entirely
in
angel
mood
she
dwells
with
beauty
beauty
that
must
die
and
joy
whose
hand
is
ever
at
his
lips
bidding
adieu
and
aching
pleasure
nigh
turning
to
poison
while
the
sips
ay
in
the
very
temple
of
delight
veiled
melancholy
has
her
shrine
though
seen
of
none
save
him
whose
strenuous
tongue
can
burst
joy
grape
against
his
palate
fine
his
soul
shall
taste
the
sadness
of
her
might
and
be
among
her
cloudy
trophies
hung
what
wonderful
lines
said
angel
who
wrote
them
are
they
your
own
ah
angel
what
would
i
give
if
they
were
no
they
are
by
john
keats
you
must
let
me
give
you
his
poems
presently
the
moonlight
began
to
lose
its
lustre
it
grew
pale
and
as
it
were
anxious
dark
billows
of
clouds
threatened
to
swallow
up
its
silver
coracle
and
presently
the
world
grew
suddenly
black
with
its
submergence
the
woods
and
meadows
disappeared
and
henry
and
angel
began
playfully
to
strike
matches
to
see
each
other
faces
thus
they
suddenly
flared
up
to
each
other
out
of
the
darkness
like
rembrandts
seen
by
lightning
and
then
they
were
lost
again
and
were
only
voices
fumbling
for
each
other
in
the
dark
yet
even
so
lips
and
arms
found
each
other
without
much
difficulty
and
when
they
began
to
think
of
the
last
train
and
fear
they
would
miss
it
but
waited
for
just
one
last
kiss
under
their
sacred
tree
the
world
suddenly
lit
up
again
for
the
moon
had
triumphed
over
its
enemies
and
come
out
just
in
time
to
give
them
its
blessing
chapter
xxvi
concerning
the
best
kind
of
wife
for
a
poet
we
are
apt
sometimes
to
complain
that
so
much
of
importance
in
our
lives
is
at
the
dispensation
of
accident
yet
how
often
too
are
we
compelled
to
confess
that
some
of
the
happiest
and
most
fruitful
circumstances
of
our
lives
are
due
to
the
diplomacies
of
chance
among
no
set
of
circumstances
is
this
more
true
than
in
the
fateful
relations
of
men
and
women
while
in
a
blind
sort
of
way
we
may
be
said
to
choose
for
ourselves
the
man
or
woman
with
whom
we
are
to
share
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
our
years
yet
the
choice
is
only
superficially
ours
frequently
our
brains
our
antecedent
plans
have
no
part
in
the
decision
the
woman
we
choose
appears
at
the
wrong
time
in
the
wrong
place
in
an
undesirable
environment
with
hair
and
eyes
and
general
complexion
different
in
colour
from
what
we
had
predestined
for
ourselves
short
when
we
had
made
up
our
minds
for
tall
and
tall
when
we
had
hoped
for
short
yet
in
in
spite
of
all
our
preconceptions
we
choose
her
this
is
not
properly
a
choice
in
which
the
intelligence
confessedly
submits
to
violence
it
is
the
compulsion
of
mysterious
instincts
that
know
better
than
our
brains
or
our
tastes
now
had
she
been
asked
beforehand
esther
might
not
have
sketched
out
a
mike
as
the
ideal
of
her
maiden
dreams
nor
indeed
might
henry
have
described
an
angelica
any
more
than
perhaps
mike
an
esther
or
angelica
a
henry
yet
chance
has
only
to
place
esther
and
mike
and
angelica
and
henry
in
the
same
room
together
for
less
than
a
minute
of
time
and
they
fly
into
the
arms
of
each
other
souls
with
an
instant
recognition
this
is
a
mystery
which
it
will
take
more
than
biology
to
explain
a
young
man
dreams
of
the
woman
he
will
some
day
marry
are
apt
to
be
meretricious
or
at
all
events
conventional
a
young
poet
especially
is
likely
to
err
in
the
direction
of
paragons
of
beauty
or
fame
or
romance
perhaps
he
dreams
of
a
great
singer
or
an
illustrious
beauty
ignorant
of
the
natural
law
which
makes
great
singers
and
illustrious
beauties
in
common
with
all
artists
incapable
of
loving
really
any
one
but
themselves
or
perhaps
it
will
be
some
woman
of
great
and
exquisite
culture
but
chance
knows
that
women
of
great
and
exquisite
culture
are
usually
beings
lacking
in
those
plastic
elemental
qualities
which
a
poet
above
all
men
needs
in
the
woman
he
shall
love
their
very
culture
while
it
may
seem
to
broaden
really
narrows
them
limits
them
to
a
caste
of
mind
and
for
an
infinite
suggestiveness
substitutes
a
few
finite
accomplishments
critics
without
understanding
have
wondered
now
and
again
at
attachments
such
as
that
of
heine
for
his
mathilde
yet
in
some
ways
mathilde
was
the
type
of
wife
best
suited
for
a
poet
she
was
just
a
wondering
child
a
bit
of
unspoiled
chaos
she
meant
as
little
intellectually
and
as
much
spiritually
as
a
wave
of
the
sea
a
bird
of
the
air
a
star
in
the
sky
another
great
poet
always
kept
in
his
room
a
growing
plant
in
a
big
tub
of
earth
and
another
tub
full
of
fresh
water
with
the
fire
going
he
used
to
say
that
he
had
the
four
elements
within
his
four
walls
and
to
people
unaccustomed
to
talk
with
the
elements
these
no
doubt
seemed
dull
and
even
remarkable
companions
like
heine
mathilde
now
angel
though
far
more
than
a
goose
intellectually
having
indeed
a
very
keen
and
subtle
mind
was
only
secondarily
intellectual
being
primarily
something
far
more
important
you
no
more
asked
of
her
to
be
intellectual
than
you
expect
a
spirit
to
be
mathematical
she
was
just
a
thrilling
with
wonder
and
love
before
the
strange
world
in
which
she
had
been
mysteriously
placed
a
and
an
excellent
housewife
in
one
as
full
of
on
the
one
hand
as
she
was
filled
with
fairy
nonsense
on
the
other
she
was
just
in
fact
the
wife
for
a
poet
the
interest
taken
in
each
other
by
angel
and
the
man
in
possession
had
not
been
unobserved
by
angel
family
her
sisters
had
teased
her
considerably
on
the
subject
why
have
you
changed
the
way
of
wearing
your
hair
angel
they
would
say
does
mesurier
like
it
that
way
or
my
word
we
are
getting
smart
and
particular
now
a
certain
gentleman
has
come
into
the
office
or
again
how
small
your
writing
is
nowadays
angel
what
have
you
changed
it
for
i
like
your
big
old
writing
best
but
i
suppose
and
then
they
would
retreat
to
a
safe
distance
to
finish
mesurier
is
of
the
same
opinion
sometimes
esther
would
start
in
pursuit
and
playful
scrimmages
would
ensue
the
hilarious
uproar
of
which
would
turn
poor
mrs
flower
brain
mrs
flower
had
certainly
not
been
unobservant
and
one
may
perhaps
suspect
that
those
cakes
and
other
delicacies
which
she
had
so
often
sent
up
the
yard
had
not
been
sent
entirely
without
those
ulterior
designs
which
every
thoughtful
mother
may
becomingly
cherish
for
her
daughters
after
angel
and
henry
excursion
to
the
country
together
henry
felt
that
some
official
announcement
of
the
state
of
his
heart
was
demanded
of
him
and
lost
no
time
in
finding
mr
flower
alone
for
that
tremulous
purpose
however
it
was
soon
over
there
were
no
questions
of
and
marriage
settlements
to
discuss
genealogically
both
sides
were
about
equally
distinguished
and
socially
belonged
to
that
large
undefined
class
called
respectable
though
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
when
so
minded
families
of
that
respectable
zone
do
not
occasionally
make
nice
distinctions
do
you
know
what
you
are
asking
for
once
said
a
retired
tradesman
wife
in
sidon
to
her
suitor
do
you
know
that

grandfathers
were
mayors
but
there
were
no
traditional
mayoralties
to
keep
these
two
young
hearts
asunder
it
was
understood
on
both
sides
that
they
had
nothing
to
bring
but
each
other
and
they
asked
nothing
better
angel
was
going
to
marry
a
poet
and
henry
a
fairy
and
not
only
they
themselves
but
the
whole
family
was
more
than
satisfied
mr
flower
was
undisguisedly
pleased
and
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
as
he
gripped
henry
hand
i
liked
you
he
said
since
the
first
time
we
shook
hands
there
was
something
honest
about
your
grip
i
liked
and
i
go
a
good
deal
by
these
things
it
is
not
many
men
i
would
trust
with

chapter
xxvii
the
book
of
angelica
the
first
duty
of
a
poet
wife
is
to
inspire
him
when
she
ceases
to
do
that
but
that
is
a
consideration
which
need
not
occupy
us
in
this
unsophisticated
story
we
have
already
seen
that
angelica
in
this
respect
early
began
her
wifely
duties
towards
henry
and
that
little
song
he
read
in
chapter
was
but
one
of
many
he
had
written
to
her
in
his
capacity
of
man
in
possession
the
feminine
inspirations
of
his
early
youth
had
been
numerous
but
mediocre
in
quality
even
in
love
as
in
all
else
his
opportunities
had
been
second
and
even
he
had
broken
his
boy
heart
time
after
time
for
some
commonplace
little
provincial
miss
who
knew
not
the
god
wonder
or
his
woe
but
at
last
in
circumstances
so
unforeseen
the
maiden
of
the
lord
had
been
revealed
to
him
and
with
the
revelation
a
great
impulse
of
metrical
expression
had
come
upon
the
young
poet
all
day
long
rhythms
and
fancies
were
effervescing
within
him
till
at
length
he
had
quite
a
publishable
mass
of
verse
for
which
it
is
to
be
feared
angelica
must
be
counted
responsible
of
these
he
was
busily
making
a
surreptitious
fair
copy
one
morning
when
old
septimus
lingard
suddenly
visited
his
seclusion
with
the
announcement
that
his
task
there
was
at
an
end
so
that
he
might
now
return
to
his
regular
office
though
of
course
henry
had
realised
that
the
present
happy
arrangement
could
not
go
on
for
ever
the
news
brought
temporary
desolation
to
the
two
young
lovers
for
four
months
their
days
had
been
spent
within
a
few
yards
of
each
other
and
though
excursions
up
the
yard
to
henry
desk
could
not
be
many
or
long
each
day
yet
each
was
conscious
that
the
other
was
near
at
hand
when
angel
sang
at
her
housework
it
was
from
the
secure
sense
that
henry
was
close
by
their
separation
was
little
more
than
that
of
a
husband
and
wife
working
in
different
rooms
of
the
same
house
but
now
their
meetings
would
have
to
be
arranged
out
somewhere
in
a
cold
world
little
considerate
of
the
convenience
of
lovers
and
for
whole
days
of
warm
proximity
they
would
have
to
exchange
occasional
snatched
precarious
hours
well
the
only
thing
to
do
was
for
henry
to
work
away
at
their
dream
of
a
home
together
home
together
however
little
just
four
walls
to
love
each
other
in
away
from
the
gaze
of
prying
eyes
none
daring
to
make
them
afraid
how
that
home
was
to
be
compassed
was
far
from
clear
in
either
of
their
minds
but
vaguely
it
was
felt
that
it
would
be
brought
about
by
the
powerful
enchantments
of
literature
henry
had
recently
had
one
of
angel
poems
accepted
by
a
rather
good
magazine
and
the
trance
of
joy
in
which
for
fully
two
hours
he
had
sat
gazing
at
that
his
first
was
hardly
less
rapturous
than
that
into
which
he
had
fallen
after
seeing
angel
for
the
first
time
so
dear
are
the
emblems
of
his
craft
to
the
artist
at
the
beginning
and
still
at
the
end
of
his
career
so
henry
had
to
finish
the
fair
copy
of
his
poems
at
home
in
his
lodgings
of
an
evening
for
so
ambitious
a
private
enterprise
could
not
be
carried
on
in
his
own
office
without
perilous
interruptions
he
was
making
the
copy
with
especial
care
in
the
form
of
a
real
book
and
when
it
was
made
he
daintily
bound
it
in
vellum
with
his
own
hands
then
he
wrapped
it
lovingly
in
tissue
paper
and
kept
it
by
him
two
or
three
days
in
readiness
for
angel
birthday
on
the
morning
of
which
day
he
hid
it
in
a
box
of
flowers
and
sent
it
to
angel
the
sympathetic
reader
can
imagine
her
delight
as
she
discovered
among
the
flowers
a
dainty
little
white
volume
bearing
the
the
book
of
angelica
by
henry
mesurier
tyre
edition
limited
to
one
copy
now
this
little
book
presently
began
to
enjoy
a
certain
very
carefully
limited
circulation
among
angel
friends
of
course
they
were
not
allowed
to
take
it
away
they
were
only
allowed
to
look
at
it
now
and
again
for
a
few
minutes
angel
anxiously
standing
by
to
see
that
they
did
not
soil
her
treasure
sometimes
mr
flower
would
ask
angel
to
show
it
to
one
of
the
family
friends
and
thus
one
evening
it
came
beneath
the
eyes
of
a
little
scotch
printer
who
had
a
great
love
for
poetry
and
some
taste
in
it
the
man
a
genius
he
said
with
all
that
authority
with
which
a
strong
scotch
accent
mysteriously
endows
the
humblest
scot
the
man
a
genius
he
repeated
his
poems
must
be
printed
henry
had
already
found
that
this
was
easier
said
than
done
for
he
had
already
tried
several
london
publishers
who
professed
their
willingness
to
publish
at
his
expense
this
little
scotch
printer
however
was
to
prove
more
venturesome
he
forthwith
communicated
a
proposal
to
henry
through
the
flowers
if
henry
would
provide
him
with
a
list
of
a
certain
number
of
friends
he
could
rely
on
for
subscriptions
he
would
take
the
risk
of
printing
an
edition
and
give
henry
half
the
profits
a
proposal
as
generous
as
it
was
rash
angel
communicated
the
offer
in
an
excited
little
letter
with
the
result
that
leith
and
henry
met
one
morning
in
the
of
the
green
man
still
and
parted
an
hour
or
so
after
in
a
high
state
of
friendship
and
deeply
pledged
together
to
a
mutual
adventure
of
three
hundred
copies
of
a
book
to
be
called
the
book
of
angelica
and
to
be
printed
in
so
dainty
a
fashion
that
the
mere
outside
should
attract
buyers
leith
worked
under
difficulties
for
his
business
small
as
it
was
was
much
saddled
with
pecuniary
obligations
which
it
but
inadequately
supported
his
printing
of
henry
poems
was
really
a
work
of
sheer
idealism
which
none
but
a
scotsman
or
perhaps
an
irishman
would
have
undertaken
and
it
was
a
work
that
might
at
any
moment
be
interrupted
by
bailiffs
empowered
to
carry
away
the
presses
and
the
very
types
over
which
henry
loved
to
hang
in
his
spare
hours
trying
to
read
in
the
lines
of
mysteriously
carved
metal
his
madrigal
to
angelica
singing
or
his
sonnet
on
first
beholding
angelica
then
leith
was
of
a
convivial
disposition
and
henry
and
he
must
have
spent
more
hours
drinking
to
the
success
of
the
little
book
than
would
have
sufficed
to
print
it
twice
over
however
the
day
did
at
last
come
when
it
was
a
living
breathing
reality
and
when
angel
and
henry
sat
with
tears
of
joy
over
the
little
book
of
angelica
was
it
not
they
told
each
other
the
little
of
their
love
how
wonderful
it
all
was
how
wonderful
their
future
was
going
to
be
what
does
it
feel
like
said
henry
playfully
recalling
their
old
talk
to
have
a
book
written
all
about
one
self
it
is
to
feel
the
happiest
and
proudest
girl
in
the
world
that
all
the
other
young
people
were
hardly
less
happy
and
excited
about
the
little
book
goes
without
saying
mike
spent
quite
a
large
sum
in
copies
and
for
a
while
employed
his
in
asking
at
with
a
nonchalant
air
as
though
he
had
barely
heard
of
the
author
if
they
sold
a
little
book
called
the
book
of
angelica
mesurier
seemed
to
see
her
faith
in
her
boy
beginning
to
be
justified
and
when
james
mesurier
opened
his
local
paper
one
morning
and
found
a
long
and
appreciative
article
on
a
certain
he
cut
it
out
to
paste
in
his
diary
perhaps
the
lad
would
prove
right
after
all
chapter
xxviii
what
comes
of
publishing
a
book
it
is
only
just
to
tyre
to
acknowledge
that
it
behaved
quite
sympathetically
towards
the
young
poet
thus
discovered
in
its
midst
its
newspapers
reviewed
him
with
marked
kindness
a
kindness
which
in
a
few
years
time
when
he
had
long
since
grown
out
of
his
baby
volume
he
was
obliged
to
set
to
the
credit
of
the
general
goodness
of
human
nature
rather
than
to
the
poetic
quality
of
his
own
verses
in
many
unexpected
quarters
also
he
met
with
recognition
which
if
not
always
intelligent
was
at
least
gratifying
for
praise
or
at
least
some
form
of
notice
is
breath
in
the
nostrils
of
the
young
poet
he
hungers
to
feel
that
his
personality
counts
for
something
though
it
be
merely
to
anger
his
it
was
perhaps
no
very
culpable
vanity
on
his
part
to
be
pleased
that
people
began
to
point
him
out
in
the
streets
and
whisper
that
that
was
the
young
poet
and
that
distant
acquaintances
seemed
more
ready
to
smile
at
him
than
before
now
and
again
one
of
these
would
stop
him
to
say
how
pleased
he
had
been
to
see
the
kind
article
about
him
in
tyrian
daily
and
that
he
intended
to
buy
the
work
as
soon
as
possible
henry
smiled
to
himself
to
hear
his
frail
little
flower
of
a
volume
spoken
of
as
a
work
as
though
it
had
been
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
and
he
rather
wondered
what
that
purchaser
would
make
of
it
as
he
turned
over
pages
of
which
so
large
a
proportion
was
reserved
for
a
spotless
frame
of
margin
no
doubt
he
would
decide
that
the
margin
had
been
left
for
the
purpose
of
making
notes
making
notes
on
those
abstruse
of
boyish
song
even
in
london
which
was
as
yet
merely
a
sounding
name
to
these
young
people
reviewers
contemptuously
disposing
of
batches
of
new
poetry
in
a
few
lines
found
a
kind
word
or
two
to
say
for
the
little
provincial
volume
and
through
one
agency
or
another
leith
within
six
weeks
of
the
publication
was
able
to
announce
that
the
edition
was
exhausted
and
that
there
was
something
like
forty
pounds
profit
to
share
between
them
that
poetry
could
be
exchanged
for
real
money
henry
had
heard
but
had
never
hoped
to
work
the
miracle
in
his
own
case
it
was
like
selling
moonlight
or
angelica
smiles
was
it
not
indeed
angelica
smiles
turned
from
one
kind
of
gold
into
another
one
more
change
they
should
undergo
and
then
return
to
her
from
whom
they
had
come
from
minted
gold
of
the
realm
they
should
change
into
the
gold
of
a
ring
and
thus
angel
should
wear
upon
her
finger
the
ornament
of
her
own
smiles
setting
aside
a
small
proportion
of
his
gains
to
buy
esther
and
mike
dot
and
mat
and
his
mother
a
little
memorial
present
each
he
then
spent
the
rest
on
angel
ring
angel
pretended
to
scold
him
for
his
extravagance
but
as
no
woman
can
resist
a
ring
her
remonstrance
was
not
convincing
and
then
as
henry
said
was
it
not
their
betrothal
ring
and
therefore
one
of
the
legitimate
expenses
of
love
three
other
acknowledgments
his
poems
brought
him
the
first
was
a
delightful
letter
from
myrtilla
williamson
how
much
men
of
talent
owe
to
the
letters
of
women
has
never
been
sufficiently
acknowledged
as
the
debt
can
never
be
adequately
repaid
of
the
many
branches
of
unselfishness
this
is
perhaps
the
most
important
to
the
world
always
behind
the
flaming
renown
of
some
great
soldier
statesman
or
poet
there
is
a
woman
hand
or
the
hands
maybe
of
many
women
pouring
unseen
the
nutritive
oil
of
praise
this
letter
henry
in
the
gladness
of
his
heart
ingenuously
showed
to
angel
with
the
result
that
it
provoked
their
first
quarrel
with
the
charms
of
a
child
angel
it
now
appeared
united
also
the
faults
she
had
it
in
her
to
be
bitterly
and
unreasonably
jealous
she
read
the
letter
coldly
you
seem
very
proud
of
her
praise
she
said
is
it
so
very
valuable
i
value
it
a
good
deal
at
all
events
answered
henry
oh
i
see
retorted
angel
i
suppose
my
praise
is
nothing
to
hers
angel
dear
what
you
mean
oh
nothing
of
course
but
i
sure
you
must
regret
caring
for
an
ignorant
girl
like
me
when
there
are
such
clever
talented
women
in
the
world
as
your
williamson
i
hate
your
learned
women
angel
i
surprised
you
can
talk
like
that
because
we
love
each
other
are
we
to
have
no
other
friends
have
as
many
as
you
like
dear
do
think
i
mind
but
i
do
want
to
see
their
letters
very
well
angel
answered
henry
quietly
he
was
making
one
of
those
discoveries
of
temperament
which
have
to
be
made
and
have
to
be
accepted
in
all
close
relationships
this
was
evidently
one
of
faults
he
must
try
to
help
her
with
it
as
he
must
try
and
let
her
help
him
with
his
the
second
was
a
letter
forwarded
care
of
his
printer
by
one
of
the
london
reviews
which
had
noticed
his
verses
it
was
from
a
rising
young
london
publisher
who
it
appeared
from
an
envelope
enclosed
had
already
tried
to
reach
him
direct
at
tyre
henry
mesurier
esqre
author
of
book
of
angelica
tyre
the
address
had
run
but
the
of
tyre
had
returned
it
to
the
sender
with
the
words
not
known
officially
stamped
upon
it
he
was
as
yet
not
known
even
in
tyre
in
another
five
years
he
shall
try
again
said
henry
savagely
to
himself
and
we
shall
see
whether
it
will
be
known
then
the
letter
expressed
the
writer
pleasure
in
the
extracts
he
had
seen
from
mesurier
book
and
hoped
that
when
his
next
book
was
ready
he
would
give
the
writer
an
opportunity
of
publishing
it
fortune
was
beginning
already
to
smile
but
the
third
acknowledgment
was
something
more
like
a
frown
and
was
at
all
events
by
far
the
most
momentous
outcome
of
henry
first
publication
one
morning
soon
after
leith
had
paid
over
to
him
his
twenty
pounds
profit
he
found
himself
unexpectedly
requested
to
step
into
the
private
office
there
at
lingard
table
he
found
the
three
partners
seated
in
solemn
conclave
as
for
a
lingard
as
senior
partner
was
the
spokesman
mesurier
he
began
the
firm
has
been
having
a
very
serious
consultation
in
regard
to
you
and
has
been
obliged
very
reluctantly
i
would
have
you
believe
to
come
to
a
painful
conclusion
we
gladly
acknowledge
that
during
the
last
few
months
your
work
has
given
us
more
satisfaction
than
at
one
time
we
expected
it
to
give
but
unfortunately
that
is
not
all
your
attention
to
your
duties
we
admit
has
been
very
satisfactory
it
is
not
a
sin
of
omission
but
one
of
commission
of
which
we
have
to
complain
what
we
have
to
complain
of
as
business
men
is
a
matter
which
perhaps
you
will
say
does
not
concern
us
though
on
that
point
we
must
respectfully
differ
from
you
mesurier
you
have
recently
published
a
book
henry
drew
himself
up
haughtily
surely
that
was
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
it
is
quite
a
pretty
little
book
continued
lingard
with
one
of
his
grim
smiles
it
contains
some
quite
pretty
verses
oh
yes
i
have
seen
it
and
henry
noticed
a
copy
of
the
offending
little
volume
lying
like
a
rose
among
some
legal
papers
at
lingard
left
hand
but
its
excellence
as
poetry
is
not
to
the
point
here
our
difficulty
is
that
you
are
now
branded
so
unmistakably
as
a
poet
that
it
is
no
use
our
any
longer
pretending
to
our
clients
that
you
are
a
clerk
so
long
as
you
were
only
suspected
of
being
a
poet
and
the
old
man
smiled
again
it
did
not
so
much
matter
but
now
that
all
tyre
knows
you
by
your
own
act
and
deed
as
a
poet
the
case
is
different
we
can
no
longer
without
risk
of
losing
confidence
with
our
clients
send
an
acknowledged
poet
to
inspect
their
books
though
personally
we
may
have
every
faith
in
your
capacity
no
doubt
they
will
be
glad
enough
to
buy
your
books
in
the
future
but
they
will
be
nervous
of
trusting
you
with
theirs
at
the
moment
and
the
old
man
laughed
heartily
at
his
own
humour
you
mean
then
sir
that
you
will
have
no
further
need
for
my
services
said
henry
looking
somewhat
pale
for
it
is
one
thing
to
hate
the
means
of
one
livelihood
and
another
to
exchange
it
for
none
i
afraid
my
dear
lad
that
that
is
what
it
comes
to
we
are
i
hope
you
will
believe
exceedingly
sorry
to
come
to
such
a
conclusion
both
for
our
own
sakes
and
yours
as
well
as
that
of
your
father
who
is
an
old
and
valued
friend
of
ours
but
we
are
able
to
see
no
other
way
out
of
the
difficulty
of
course
you
will
not
leave
us
this
minute
but
take
what
time
you
need
to
look
round
and
arrange
your
future
plans
and
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
we
shall
part
from
you
as
good
friends
and
sincere
the
old
man
held
out
his
hand
and
henry
took
it
with
a
grateful
sense
of
the
friendly
manner
in
which
lingard
had
performed
a
painful
task
and
a
certain
recognition
that
after
all
a
poet
must
be
something
of
a
nuisance
to
when
he
returned
to
his
desk
he
sat
for
a
long
time
thoughtful
divided
in
mind
between
exultation
that
he
was
soon
to
be
free
to
take
the
adventurous
highway
of
literature
and
anxiety
as
to
where
in
a
time
his
preliminary
meals
were
to
come
from
yet
after
all
the
main
thing
was
to
be
free
of
this
servitude
out
of
freedom
all
things
might
be
hoped
still
as
henry
looked
round
at
the
familiar
faces
of
his
and
realised
that
in
a
month
time
his
comradeship
with
them
would
be
at
an
end
he
was
surprised
to
feel
a
certain
pang
of
separation
mere
custom
has
so
great
a
part
in
our
affections
that
though
a
routine
may
have
been
dull
and
distasteful
if
it
has
any
extenuating
circumstances
at
all
we
change
it
with
a
certain
irrational
regret
after
all
his
was
associated
with
much
contraband
merriment
and
unconsciously
his
associates
had
taken
a
valuable
part
in
his
training
humanised
him
in
certain
directions
as
he
had
humanised
them
in
others
they
had
saved
him
from
dilettanteism
and
whatever
he
wrote
in
future
would
owe
something
warm
and
kindly
to
the
years
he
had
spent
with
them
his
very
desk
took
on
a
pathetic
expression
as
of
a
place
that
was
so
soon
to
know
him
no
more
for
ever
and
smith
wrangling
over
and
cesspools
at
the
counter
just
as
on
the
first
day
he
had
heard
him
almost
moved
him
to
tears
perhaps
in
ten
years
time
were
he
to
come
back
he
would
find
him
still
at
his
post
fervidly
engaged
in
the
same
altercations
with
only
a
little
additional
greyness
at
the
temples
to
mark
the
lapse
of
time
and
jenkins
would
still
be
sitting
in
the
little
cupboard
with
cashier
painted
on
the
glass
window
as
three
approached
he
would
still
be
heard
loudly
counting
his
cash
and
shovelling
the
gold
into
bags
and
the
silver
into
little
marked
apiece
in
a
wild
rush
to
reach
the
bank
before
it
closed
and
would
the
same
good
fellows
a
little
more
serious
because
long
since
married
be
cracking
jokes
and
loafing
near
the
in
some
rare
safe
hour
of
the
afternoon
when
all
the
partners
were
out
to
make
a
spring
for
the
desks
as
the
carefully
learnt
tread
of
one
or
another
of
those
partners
followed
the
opening
of
the
front
door
the
very
work
that
he
hated
seemed
to
wear
an
unwonted
look
of
tenderness
who
would
keep
the
books
he
had
kept
with
something
of
his
father
neatness
who
would
look
after
the
accounts
of
the
rev
thomas
salthouse
or
take
charge
of
james
shuttleworth
esqre
of
course
it
was
absurd
absurd
perhaps
just
because
it
was
human
for
was
he
not
going
to
be
free
free
to
fulfil
his
dreams
free
to
follow
those
voices
that
had
so
often
called
him
from
beyond
the
sunset
soon
he
would
be
able
to
cry
out
to
them
with
literal
truth
i
am
yours
yours
all
yours
and
in
those
ten
years
which
were
to
pass
so
invariably
for
smith
and
for
jenkins
and
the
rest
what
various
and
dazzling
changes
might
be
must
be
in
store
for
him
long
before
the
end
of
them
he
must
have
written
masterpieces
and
become
famous
and
angel
and
he
be
long
settled
together
in
their
paradise
of
home
henry
was
pleased
to
find
that
his
chums
were
to
miss
him
no
less
than
he
was
to
miss
them
as
an
unofficial
master
of
their
pale
revels
his
place
would
not
be
easy
to
fill
and
he
was
much
touched
when
a
day
or
two
before
the
end
of
the
month
which
was
the
time
mutually
agreed
upon
for
henry
to
look
round
they
intimated
their
desire
to
give
a
little
dinner
in
his
honour
at
the
jovial
clerks
tavern
henry
was
nothing
loth
and
the
evening
came
and
went
with
no
little
emotion
and
no
little
wine
on
either
side
he
had
bidden
to
his
employers
in
the
afternoon
and
lingard
had
shaken
his
hand
and
admonished
him
as
to
his
future
with
something
of
paternal
affection
toward
the
close
of
the
dinner
bob
cherry
who
acted
as
chairman
rose
with
an
unaccustomed
blush
upon
his
cheek
to
propose
the
toast
of
the
evening
they
had
had
the
honour
and
pleasure
he
said
to
be
associated
for
several
years
past
with
a
gentleman
to
whom
that
evening
they
were
to
say
no
better
fellow
had
ever
graced
the
offices
of
lingard
and
fields
and
his
would
be
a
real
loss
to
the
gaiety
of
their
little
world
they
understood
that
he
was
a
poet
and
indeed
had
he
not
already
published
a
charming
volume
with
which
they
were
all
acquainted
still
this
made
no
difference
to
them
certain
high
powers
might
object
but
they
liked
him
none
the
less
and
whether
he
was
a
poet
or
not
he
was
certainly
a
jolly
good
fellow
and
wherever
his
new
career
might
take
him
the
good
wishes
of
his
old
chums
would
certainly
follow
him
the
chairman
concluded
his
speech
by
requesting
his
acceptance
of
a
copy
of
the
works
of
lord
macaulay
as
a
small
remembrance
of
the
days
they
had
spent
together
the
toast
having
been
seconded
and
drunk
with
resounding
cordiality
henry
responded
in
a
speech
of
mingled
playfulness
and
emotion
assuring
them
on
his
part
that
though
they
might
not
be
poets
he
thought
no
worse
of
them
for
that
but
should
always
remember
them
as
the
best
fellows
he
had
ever
known
the
talk
then
became
general
and
tender
with
reminiscence
after
all
what
a
lot
of
pleasant
things
those
hard
years
had
given
them
to
remember
so
they
kept
the
evening
going
and
it
was
not
till
an
early
hour
of
the
following
day
that
this
important
volume
of
henry
life
was
finally
closed
chapter
xxix
mike
turn
to
move
while
henry
had
been
busily
engaged
in
winning
angelica
and
writing
and
printing
his
little
book
mike
fortunes
had
not
been
idle
meanwhile
the
sothern
dramatic
club
had
given
two
more
performances
in
which
his
parts
had
been
considerable
and
been
played
by
him
with
such
success
as
to
make
the
former
pieman
apprentice
one
of
the
chief
members
of
the
club
mike
and
his
friends
therefore
became
more
and
more
eager
for
him
to
try
his
talents
on
the
great
stage
but
this
was
an
experiment
not
so
easy
to
make
however
unknown
a
writer
may
be
he
can
still
at
least
write
his
book
in
his
obscurity
and
when
done
bring
it
to
market
with
a
reasonable
hope
of
its
finding
a
publisher
moreover
though
he
may
remain
for
years
unappreciated
his
writings
still
go
on
fighting
for
him
till
his
due
recognition
is
won
he
has
not
to
find
his
publisher
before
he
begins
to
write
yet
it
is
actually
such
a
disability
under
which
the
unproved
and
often
the
proved
actor
must
labour
unless
some
one
engages
him
to
act
and
provides
an
audience
for
him
he
has
no
opportunity
of
showing
his
powers
and
such
opportunities
are
difficult
to
find
unless
you
are
a
dissolute
young
lord
or
belong
to
one
of
the
traditional
theatrical
families
whose
members
are
brought
up
to
the
stage
as
the
sons
of
a
lawyer
are
brought
up
to
law
for
the
avenues
to
the
stage
are
blocked
by
perhaps
more
frivolous
incompetents
than
any
other
profession
any
idle
girl
with
good
looks
and
any
idle
gentleman
with
something
of
a
good
carriage
deem
themselves
qualified
for
one
of
the
most
arduous
of
the
arts
mike
plan
had
been
to
try
every
considerable
actor
that
came
to
tyre
who
might
possibly
have
a
vacant
place
in
his
company
but
he
had
tried
many
in
vain
while
one
or
two
were
unable
to
see
him
at
all
most
of
them
treated
him
with
a
kindness
remarkable
in
men
daily
besieged
by
the
innumerable
hopeless
they
gave
him
good
advice
they
wished
him
well
but
already
they
had
long
lists
of
experienced
applicants
waiting
their
turn
for
the
coveted
vacancy
at
last
however
there
came
to
tyre
a
famous
romantic
actor
who
was
said
to
be
more
sympathetic
towards
the
youthful
aspirant
than
the
other
heads
of
his
profession
and
as
too
he
was
rumoured
to
be
vulnerable
on
the
side
of
literature
mike
and
henry
agreed
to
make
a
joint
attack
upon
him
mike
should
write
a
brief
note
asking
for
an
interview
and
henry
should
follow
it
up
with
another
letter
to
the
same
effect
and
at
the
same
time
send
him
a
copy
of
the
book
of
angelica
the
plan
was
carried
out
both
letters
and
the
book
were
sent
and
the
young
men
awaited
with
impatience
the
result
henry
had
adopted
a
very
lofty
tone
in
granting
my
friend
an
interview
he
had
said
you
may
be
giving
his
first
chance
to
an
actor
of
genius
of
course
you
may
not
but
at
least
you
will
have
had
the
satisfaction
of
giving
to
possible
genius
that
benefit
of
the
doubt
which
we
have
a
right
to
expect
from
the
creator
of
and
he
named
one
of
the
actor
most
famous
rôles
a
cordial
answer
came
by
return
enclosing
two
stalls
for
the
following
evening
when
said
the
great
actor
he
would
be
glad
to
see
laflin
during
or
after
the
performance
the
two
young
men
were
in
their
places
as
the
curtain
rose
and
it
goes
without
saying
that
their
enthusiasm
was
unequalled
in
the
audience
between
the
third
and
fourth
acts
there
was
a
considerable
interval
and
early
in
the
performance
it
had
been
notified
to
mike
that
the
great
actor
would
see
him
then
so
when
the
time
came
with
a
whispered
good
luck
from
henry
he
left
his
place
and
was
led
through
a
little
mysterious
iron
door
at
the
back
of
the
boxes
on
to
the
stage
and
into
the
great
man
opening
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
at
one
side
of
the
stage
it
was
more
like
a
brilliantly
lighted
cave
hung
with
mirrors
than
a
room
mirrors
and
lights
and
laurel
wreaths
with
cards
attached
and
many
photographs
with
huge
signatures
scrawled
across
them
and
a
magnificent
being
reading
a
book
while
his
dresser
laced
up
some
high
boots
he
was
to
wear
in
the
following
act
made
mike
first
impression
then
the
magnificent
being
looked
up
with
a
charming
smile
laflin
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
i
hope
you
will
excuse
my
rising
he
said
laflin
with
a
captivating
familiarity
of
intonation
as
though
mike
was
something
between
an
old
friend
and
a
distinguished
stranger
so
you
are
thinking
of
joining
our
profession
i
hope
you
liked
the
performance
i
saw
you
in
front
or
at
least
i
thought
it
was
you
and
your
friend
i
hope
he
will
come
and
see
me
some
other
time
i
have
been
delighted
with
his
poems
there
is
something
dazzling
and
disconcerting
to
an
average
layman
about
an
actor
even
though
the
be
that
of
an
intimate
friend
he
feels
like
a
being
on
the
confines
of
two
worlds
and
belonging
to
neither
awkwardly
suspended
fact
and
fancy
the
actor
for
a
while
has
laid
aside
his
part
and
forgotten
his
wig
and
his
as
he
talks
to
you
he
is
thinking
of
himself
merely
as
a
private
individual
whereas
his
visitor
can
not
forget
that
in
appearance
he
is
a
king
or
an
dandy
or
though
you
know
him
well
enough
as
a
young
man
of
thirty
a
bowed
and
wrinkled
greybeard
the
visitor
voice
rings
thin
and
hestitating
it
can
not
strike
the
right
pitch
and
generally
he
does
himself
no
sort
of
justice
perhaps
however
it
was
because
mike
had
been
born
for
this
world
in
which
now
for
the
first
time
he
found
himself
that
he
suffered
from
none
of
this
embarrassment
perhaps
too
it
was
some
instinct
of
his
own
gifts
that
made
him
quite
in
the
presence
of
acknowledged
distinction
so
that
you
might
have
thought
he
had
no
reverence
as
he
had
passed
across
the
stage
he
had
eyed
that
mysterious
rather
with
the
eye
of
a
future
than
of
a
youth
all
whose
dreams
converged
at
this
point
and
at
this
moment
one
touch
of
the
poetry
of
contrast
caught
his
eye
of
which
custom
would
probably
have
made
him
unobservant
in
an
alcove
of
the
stage
a
as
mike
knew
already
to
call
it
a
beautiful
spirit
in
gauze
and
tights
was
silently
rehearsing
to
herself
a
dance
which
she
had
to
perform
in
the
next
act
softly
and
silently
she
danced
absorbed
in
the
evolutions
of
her
lithe
young
body
paying
as
little
heed
to
the
rough
who
hurried
scenery
about
her
on
every
side
as
those
hardened
paid
to
her
dancing
henry
or
ned
would
probably
have
fallen
madly
in
love
with
her
on
the
spot
to
mike
she
was
but
a
part
of
the
economy
of
the
stage
and
had
she
been
cleopatra
herself
eyes
filled
to
overflowing
with
the
beauty
of
esther
would
have
taken
no
more
intimate
note
of
her
so
it
is
said
painters
and
sculptors
regard
their
models
with
cold
artistic
eyes
this
enabled
mike
to
show
to
the
best
advantage
and
while
they
talked
the
great
actor
with
an
eye
accustomed
to
read
faces
soon
made
up
his
mind
about
him
i
believe
you
and
your
friend
are
right
laflin
he
said
i
am
much
mistaken
if
you
are
not
a
born
actor
but
if
you
are
that
you
will
not
need
to
be
told
that
the
way
is
long
and
difficult
nor
will
you
mind
that
it
is
so
every
true
artist
rather
loves
than
fears
the
drudgery
of
his
art
it
is
one
of
the
tests
of
his
being
an
artist
art
is
undoubtedly
the
pleasantest
of
all
work
but
it
is
work
for
all
that
and
none
of
the
easiest
perhaps
it
is
the
pleasantest
because
it
is
the
hardest
so
if
you
really
want
to
be
an
artist
you
wo
object
to
beginning
your
journey
to
the
top

at
that
moment
you

i
shall
have
to
say

the

and
moving
towards
the
door
but
i
shall
look
forward
to

my
good
wishes
to
your
friend
and
so
the
happiest
person
in
that
theatre
slipped
back
to
his
seat
by
the
side
of
a
friend
who
was
surely
as
happy
at
his
good
news
as
though
it
had
been
his
own
meanwhile
esther
had
been
counting
the
hours
till
ten
when
she
made
a
pretence
of
going
to
bed
with
the
rest
but
there
was
no
sleep
for
her
till
she
had
heard
mike
news
her
bedroom
looked
out
from
the
top
of
the
house
into
the
front
garden
and
she
had
arranged
to
have
a
lamp
burning
at
the
window
so
that
mike
on
his
way
home
should
understand
that
all
was
safe
for
a
snatched
five
minutes
talk
in
the
porch
she
sat
trying
to
read
till
about
midnight
when
through
her
windows
came
the
soft
whistle
she
had
been
waiting
for
turning
down
the
lamp
to
show
that
she
had
heard
she
stole
down
through
the
quiet
house
and
cautiously
opened
the
front
door
fastened
it
seemed
with
a
hundred
bolts
and
chains
is
that
you
mike
for
answer
two
arms
which
she
did
mistake
for
a
burglar
were
thrown
round
her
esther
i
found
my
million
pounds
oh
mike
he
really
going
to
help
you
and
here
there
is
no
further
necessity
for
all
persons
except
mike
and
esther
will
please
leave
the
porch
chapter
xxx
unchartered
freedom
on
the
morning
after
the
dinner
with
which
he
bade
farewell
to
lingard
and
fields
henry
awoke
at
his
usual
hour
to
a
very
unusual
feeling
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
could
stay
in
bed
as
long
as
he
pleased
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
ned
hazell
lay
sleeping
the
deep
sleep
of
the
unpunctual
clerk
and
henry
when
he
had
for
a
moment
or
two
dwelt
upon
his
own
happiness
took
a
malicious
joy
in
arousing
him
ned
he
shouted
get
up
you
be
late
for
the
office
ned
gave
out
a
deep
sound
something
between
a
snore
a
moan
and
an
imprecation
ned
his
tormentor
persisted
drawing
the
clothes
warmly
round
him
in
a
luxury
of
indifference
to
the
time
of
day
ned
presently
began
rubbing
his
head
vigorously
which
was
one
of
his
preliminaries
of
awakening
and
then
mournfully
raised
himself
in
bed
a
pillar
of
somnolence
you
might
let
a
fellow
have
his
sleep
out
he
said
why
do
you
get
up
yourself
oh
i
remember
you
a
literary
gentleman
from
that
why
you
so
mighty
ready
to
root
me
out
and
he
aimed
a
pillow
at
henry
bed
in
derision
yes
henry
was
free
an
independent
gentleman
of
time
and
space
the
clock
might
strike
itself
hoarse
yet
if
he
wished
he
might
go
on
staying
in
bed
he
was
free
his
late
had
no
jurisdiction
here
it
would
even
be
in
his
power
here
to
order
fields
out
of
the
room
and
if
he
refused
forcibly
to
eject
him
into
the
street
why
did
fields
appear
to
gratify
him
in
this
matter
so
he
indulged
his
imagination
while
ned
dressed
in
haste
with
the
fear
of
the
tyrant
evident
upon
him
poor
fellow
he
would
have
to
choose
between
two
cups
of
coffee
and
two
eggs
and
five
minutes
late
probably
he
would
split
the
difference
bolt
one
cup
of
coffee
and
one
egg
and
arrive
two
and
a
half
minutes
late
henry
watched
him
with
compassion
and
when
he
had
gone
his
ways
himself
rose
languidly
and
dressed
indolently
as
with
the
aid
of
an
invisible
valet
at
length
he
sauntered
down
to
breakfast
and
sent
out
for
a
morning
paper
which
he
on
no
account
ever
read
he
could
imagine
no
more
insulting
waste
of
time
he
looked
it
through
but
found
no
reference
to
the
real
significance
of
the
day
breakfast
over
he
wondered
what
he
should
do
with
himself
how
he
should
spend
the
day
his
clear
duty
was
to
begin
being
a
great
man
on
the
spot
and
work
at
being
a
great
man
every
day
punctually
from
nine
till
six
but
where
should
he
begin
should
he
sit
down
in
a
way
and
begin
his
long
romantic
poem
or
should
he
write
an
essay
or
again
should
he
make
a
start
on
his
novel
romantic
poems
he
felt
however
are
only
well
begun
on
special
days
not
easy
to
define
essays
are
only
written
on
days
when
we
have
determined
to
be
idle
and
this
after
the
opening
flirtation
with
indolence
must
be
a
busy
day
and
it
is
not
every
day
that
one
can
begin
a
novel
he
might
arrange
his
books
but
really
they
were
very
well
arranged
already
or
suppose
he
went
out
for
a
walk
walking
quickened
the
brain
he
might
go
and
look
in
at
the
art
gallery
where
he
had
been
for
a
long
while
and
see
the
new
picture
the
morning
paper
was
talking
about
it
was
by
a
painter
whose
poems
he
already
knew
and
loved
that
might
inspire
him
so
by
an
accident
of
idleness
he
presently
found
himself
standing
rapt
before
the
most
wonderful
picture
he
had
ever
seen
a
picture
to
see
which
he
said
to
himself
men
would
make
pilgrimages
to
tyre
when
tyre
was
a
ruinous
seaport
from
which
the
traffic
of
the
world
had
long
since
passed
away
henry
at
this
time
had
visited
none
of
the
great
galleries
and
except
in
a
few
reproductions
knew
nothing
of
the
great
italian
masters
therefore
to
him
this
picture
was
italy
the
renaissance
and
catholicism
all
concentrated
into
one
enthralling
canvas
but
it
was
something
greater
than
that
it
was
the
terrible
meeting
of
youth
and
love
and
death
in
one
tremendous
moment
of
infinite
loss
infinite
passion
and
infinite
loss
were
here
pictured
in
a
medium
which
combined
all
that
was
spiritual
and
all
that
was
sensual
in
a
harmony
of
beauty
that
was
in
the
same
moment
delirium
and
peace
the
irresistible
cry
of
the
colour
to
the
senses
the
spheral
call
of
the
theme
and
its
agony
to
the
soul
beatrice
dead
and
dante
taken
in
a
dream
across
the
strewn
poppies
of
her
to
look
his
last
on
the
sleeping
face
yet
a
little
smiling
in
the
of
life
her
soul
already
carried
by
angels
far
over
the
curved
and
fluted
roofs
of
the
florentine
houses
on
its
way
to
paradise
little
beatrice
not
till
they
meet
again
in
paradise
shall
he
see
again
that
holy
face
in
a
dream
of
loss
he
gazes
upon
her
as
the
angels
lift
up
the
sheet
and
not
only
her
face
but
every
detail
of
that
room
of
death
is
etched
in
tears
upon
his
eyes
the
distant
winding
stair
the
pallid
the
intruding
light
of
day
all
passion
and
all
loss
all
youth
all
love
and
all
death
met
together
in
an
everlasting
requiem
of
tragic
colour
henry
sat
long
before
this
picture
enveloped
as
it
were
in
its
rich
gloom
as
the
painted
profundity
of
a
church
absorbs
one
in
its
depths
and
with
the
impression
of
its
solemn
beauty
was
blent
a
despairing
awe
of
the
artist
who
of
a
little
coloured
earth
had
created
such
a
masterpiece
of
vitality
thrown
on
to
a
thin
screen
of
canvas
so
enduringly
palpable
so
sumptuous
and
so
poignantly
dominating
a
reflection
of
his
visions
what
a
passionate
energy
of
beauty
must
have
been
in
this
man
soul
what
a
constant
fury
of
meditation
upon
things
divine
when
henry
came
back
to
himself
his
first
thought
was
to
share
it
with
angel
little
soul
how
her
face
would
flame
how
her
body
would
tremble
with
the
wonder
of
it
in
the
minutiae
the
technicalities
of
appreciation
angel
like
henry
himself
might
be
lacking
but
in
the
motive
fervour
of
appreciation
who
was
like
her
it
was
almost
painful
to
see
the
joy
which
certain
simple
wonders
gave
her
anything
intense
or
prodigal
in
nature
any
splendidly
fluent
outpouring
of
the
elements
the
fierce
life
of
streaming
fire
water
in
gliding
or
tumultuous
masses
the
vivid
gold
of
crocus
and
daffodil
spouting
up
through
the
earth
in
spring
the
exquisite
liquidity
of
a
bird
singing
these
as
with
all
elemental
poetic
natures
gave
her
the
same
keen
joy
which
we
fable
for
those
who
in
the
intense
morning
of
the
world
first
heard
them
fable
indeed
for
why
should
we
suppose
that
because
ears
deaf
a
thousand
years
heard
the
nightingale
too
it
should
therefore
be
less
new
for
those
who
hear
it
for
the
first
time
rather
shall
it
be
more
than
less
for
us
by
the
memories
transmitted
in
our
blood
from
all
the
generations
who
before
have
listened
and
gone
their
way
so
henry
sought
out
angel
and
they
both
stood
in
front
of
the
great
picture
for
a
long
while
without
a
word
presently
angel
put
the
feeling
of
both
of
them
into
a
single
phrase
henry
dear
we
have
found
our
church
and
indeed
for
many
months
henceforth
this
picture
was
to
be
their
altar
their
place
of
prayer
often
hereafter
when
their
hopes
were
overcast
or
life
grew
mean
with
little
cares
they
would
slip
singly
or
together
into
that
gallery
and
let
the
beauty
of
eternity
smooth
from
their
brows
the
little
frets
of
time
thus
henry
first
day
of
freedom
had
begun
auspiciously
with
the
unexpected
discovery
of
an
inalienable
possession
of
beauty
yet
the
little
cares
were
not
far
off
waiting
their
time
and
that
night
henry
lay
long
awake
asking
himself
what
he
was
going
to
do
whence
was
to
come
the
material
gold
and
silver
by
which
this
impetuous
spirit
was
to
be
sustained
a
sum
not
exceeding
five
pounds
represented
his
accumulated
resources
and
they
would
not
last
longer
than
five
pounds
he
needed
little
but
that
little
he
needed
emphatically
soon
a
new
book
and
other
literary
projects
would
keep
him
going
but
meanwhile
how
were
the
next
two
or
three
months
to
be
bridged
return
to
his
father
house
he
neither
would
nor
perhaps
indeed
could
so
he
lay
awake
a
long
while
fruitlessly
thinking
but
just
before
he
slept
a
thought
that
made
him
laugh
himself
awake
suggested
itself
why
not
go
and
ask
aunt
tipping
to
take
pity
on
you
so
he
went
to
sleep
resolved
if
only
for
the
fun
of
it
to
pay
a
visit
to
aunt
tipping
on
the
morrow
chapter
xxxi
a
preposterous
aunt
no
doubt
it
has
been
surmised
from
what
has
gone
before
that
when
henry
said
to
himself
that
he
would
go
and
see
aunt
tipping
he
did
not
propose
to
himself
a
visit
to
the
country
seat
of
some
quaint
old
lady
of
quality
baronial
towers
and
stately
avenues
of
ancestral
elm
did
not
make
a
picturesque
background
for
his
thoughts
as
he
recalled
aunt
tipping
poor
kind
aunt
tipping
it
is
a
shame
to
banter
her
memory
even
in
so
obvious
a
fashion
for
if
ever
there
was
a
kind
heart
it
was
hers
in
fact
she
possessed
in
a
degree
that
amounted
to
genius
one
of
the
rarest
of
human
qualities
unconditional
pity
for
the
unhappy
human
creature
within
her
narrow
and
squalid
sphere
she
was
never
known
to
fail
of
such
succour
as
was
hers
to
give
to
misfortune
however
or
misery
however
no
religion
or
philosophy
has
ever
yet
been
merciful
enough
to
human
weakness
matilda
tipping
repaired
the
lack
so
far
as
she
went
in
fact
she
had
unconsciously
realised
that
weakness
human
nature
it
would
be
difficult
to
fix
upon
an
offence
that
would
disqualify
you
for
aunt
tipping
pity
to
the
prodigalities
of
the
passions
and
the
appetites
disastrously
indulged
she
was
accustomed
by
a
long
succession
of
those
sad
and
shady
lodgers
to
whom
it
was
part
of
her
precarious
livelihood
to
let
her
rooms
and
not
infrequently
to
forgive
them
their
rent
that
men
and
women
should
drink
too
much
and
love
too
many
was
her
experience
told
her
one
of
those
laws
of
nature
that
seemed
to
make
a
good
deal
of
unnecessary
inconvenience
in
mortal
affairs
but
against
which
mere
preaching
or
punishment
availed
nothing
all
that
was
to
be
done
was
so
far
as
possible
to
repair
their
ravages
in
particular
instances
and
heal
the
wounds
of
human
passion
with
simple
human
kindness
of
two
vessels
one
for
honour
and
the
other
for
dishonour
surely
nature
never
made
so
complete
a
contrast
as
matilda
tipping
and
her
sister
mary
mesurier
both
country
girls
born
in
a
humble
though
defiantly
respectable
stratum
of
society
the
ways
of
the
two
sisters
had
already
parted
in
childhood
mary
was
studious
neat
and
religious
matilda
was
tomboyish
impatient
of
restraint
and
fond
of
unedifying
associates
your
aunt
never
aspired
mesurier
would
say
of
aunt
tipping
sometimes
to
her
children
and
while
still
a
child
she
had
often
reproached
her
with
her
fondness
for
gossiping
with
companions
beneath
her
matilda
could
never
be
persuaded
to
care
for
books
she
was
naturally
illiterate
and
even
late
in
life
had
a
fixed
aversion
to
writing
her
own
letters
whereas
at
the
age
of
seven
mary
had
been
public
scrivener
for
the
whole
village
but
with
these
regrettable
instincts
from
the
first
matilda
had
also
manifested
a
whimsical
liveliness
an
unconquerable
lightheartedness
which
made
you
forgive
her
anything
and
for
which
poor
soul
she
had
use
enough
before
she
was
done
with
life
at
seventeen
added
to
good
looks
of
which
at
fifty
there
was
scarcely
a
trace
in
the
thin
and
meanly
worn
face
this
vivacity
had
proved
a
tragic
snare
a
certain
young
capitalist
known
as
a
great
gentleman
of
that
countryside
had
pounced
down
on
the
gay
and
careless
young
matilda
and
had
at
once
provided
her
life
with
its
formative
tragedy
and
its
deathless
romance
even
at
fifty
hopelessly
buried
among
the
back
streets
and
pawnshops
of
life
heaven
still
opened
in
the
heart
of
matilda
tipping
at
the
mention
of
the
name
of
william
allsopp
for
several
years
she
had
lived
with
the
mesuriers
as
general
help
to
her
sister
between
whom
and
her
in
spite
of
surface
disparities
there
was
an
indissoluble
bond
of
affection
till
at
or
so
she
had
suddenly
won
the
heart
of
a
sad
old
widower
of
named
samuel
tipping
samuel
tipping
was
no
ordinary
widower
as
you
looked
at
his
severe
thoughtful
face
surmounted
by
a
shock
of
beautiful
white
hair
you
instinctively
respected
him
and
when
you
heard
that
he
lived
by
cobbling
shoes
by
day
and
playing
a
violin
in
the
theatre
royal
orchestra
by
night
occasionally
putting
off
his
leather
apron
to
give
a
music
lesson
in
the
front
parlour
of
an
afternoon
you
respected
him
all
the
more
there
had
been
but
one
thing
against
mr
eligibility
for
marriage
matilda
tipping
would
tell
you
even
years
after
with
a
lowering
of
her
voice
he
was
said
to
be
an
atheist
and
a
reader
of
strange
books
yet
he
seemed
a
quiet
manageable
man
and
likely
again
in
mrs
tipping
phrase
to
prove
a
good
provider
so
she
had
risked
his
heterodoxy
which
indeed
was
a
somewhat
fanciful
objection
on
her
part
and
made
him
as
he
declared
with
his
dying
breath
the
best
of
wives
it
chanced
that
when
henry
in
pursuance
of
his
resolve
made
his
way
the
following
afternoon
through
a
dingy
little
street
and
knocked
on
the
door
of
a
dingy
little
house
bearing
upon
a
brass
plate
the
legend
boots
neatly
repaired
mr
tipping
was
engaged
in
giving
one
of
those
very
music
lessons
a
dingy
little
opened
the
door
and
said
that
mrs
tipping
was
out
shopping
but
would
be
back
soon
from
the
front
parlour
came
the
lifeless
of
the
piano
and
mr
tipping
voice
gruffly
counting
time
to
the
cheerless
exercises
of
a
very
evident
beginner
one
two
three
one
two
three
one
two
three
went
mr
voice
with
an
occasional
infusion
of
savagery
but
mr
tipping
is
at
home
said
henry
i
will
wait
till
he
is
disengaged
i
will
make
myself
comfortable
in
the
kitchen
henry
knew
his
way
about
at
aunt
tipping
and
remembered
there
was
only
one
front
parlour
adding
with
something
of
pride
i
mrs
tipping
nephew
you
know
presently
the
torture
in
the
front
parlour
was
at
an
end
and
as
mr
tipping
was
about
to
turn
upstairs
to
the
little
back
room
where
he
mended
his
shoes
henry
emerged
upon
him
from
the
kitchen
they
had
had
some
talks
on
books
and
the
general
misgovernment
of
the
universe
for
mr
tipping
really
was
something
of
an
atheist
on
henry
occasional
visits
and
were
no
strangers
to
each
other
why
henry
lad
whoever
expected
to
see
you
your
aunt
out
at
present
but
she
be
back
soon
come
into
the
parlour
if
you
do
mind
uncle
tipping
i
rather
come
upstairs
with
you
i
love
the
smell
of
the
leather
and
the
sight
of
all
those
sharp
little
knives
and
the
black
shiny
do
you
call
it
and
we
can
have
a
talk
about
books
till
aunt
comes
home
all
right
lad
but
it
a
dusty
place
and
there
hardly
a
corner
to
sit
down
in
so
up
they
went
to
a
little
room
where
in
a
chaos
of
boots
mended
on
one
hand
and
boots
to
mend
on
the
other
sheets
of
leather
lying
about
in
one
corner
a
great
tubfull
of
water
in
which
the
leather
was
soaked
an
old
boyish
fascination
of
henry
mr
tipping
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
days
he
sat
on
a
low
bench
near
a
window
along
which
ran
a
broad
sill
full
of
tools
on
this
too
lay
an
opened
book
into
which
mr
tipping
would
dip
now
and
again
when
he
could
safely
leave
the
boot
he
was
engaged
upon
to
the
mechanical
skill
of
his
hands
at
one
end
of
the
was
a
small
collection
of
books
a
dozen
or
so
shabby
volumes
though
these
were
far
from
constituting
mr
complete
library
mr
tipping
belonged
to
that
pathetic
army
of
who
subsist
on
the
refuse
of
the
stalls
which
he
hunted
not
for
rare
editions
but
for
the
sheer
bread
of
life
or
rather
the
stale
crusts
of
knowledge
his
tastes
were
not
literary
in
the
special
sense
of
the
word
for
he
had
no
fancy
and
fine
passages
except
in
so
far
as
they
were
controversial
left
him
cold
his
mind
was
primarily
scientific
secondarily
philosophic
and
occasionally
historic
travels
and
books
of
physical
science
were
the
finds
for
which
mainly
he
rummaged
the
stalls
at
the
moment
his
pet
study
was
astronomy
and
a
curious
apparatus
in
one
of
the
corners
which
henry
had
noticed
as
he
entered
was
his
sad
attempt
to
rig
up
a
telescope
for
himself
it
not
so
bad
as
it
looks
he
said
pointing
it
out
but
then
he
added
with
a
smile
half
sad
and
half
humorous
there
are
not
many
stars
to
be
seen
from
tichborne
street
it
was
a
touching
characteristic
of
the
type
of
bookman
to
which
mr
tipping
belonged
that
the
astronomy
from
which
he
was
reading
by
no
means
embodied
the
latest
discoveries
in
fact
it
narrowly
escaped
being
science
for
it
was
dated
very
early
in
the
eighteen
hundreds
but
an
astronomy
was
an
astronomy
to
mr
tipping
and
had
copernicus
been
born
late
enough
he
would
most
certainly
have
imbibed
ptolemaic
doctrines
with
grateful
unsuspicion
indeed
had
it
been
put
to
him
this
astronomy
after
copernicus
at
and
this
after
ptolemy
for
sixpence
his
means
alone
would
have
left
him
no
choice
it
is
so
the
old
clothes
of
the
mind
like
the
old
clothes
of
the
body
superseded
science
forgotten
philosophy
find
a
market
and
a
book
remains
a
book
with
the
power
of
comforting
or
diverting
some
indigent
poor
soul
so
long
as
the
stitching
holds
it
together
presently
there
was
a
knock
at
the
front
door
there
your
aunt
said
mr
tipping
and
as
the
door
opened
the
little
was
to
be
heard
whispering
her
mistress
that
a
young
gentleman
who
said
he
was
her
nephew
had
come
and
was
upstairs
with
the
master
well
i
never
exclaimed
mrs
tipping
immediately
starting
upstairs
towards
the
open
door
of
the
cobblery
henry
was
standing
on
the
threshold
and
the
little
woman
gave
him
a
hearty
hug
of
welcome
well
i
glad
to
see
you
and
how
are
they
all
at
home
and
she
ran
over
the
list
name
for
name
we
must
forget
your
father
but
he
a
hard
and
no
mistake
said
the
aunt
putting
on
a
mimic
expression
of
severity
he
an
upright
man
is
james
mesurier
said
mr
tipping
rather
severely
oh
yes
yes
we
know
that
crosspatch
i
saying
nothing
against
him
he
good
at
heart
i
know
but
he
a
little
hard
on
the
surface
like
some
other
folks
i
know
making
a
face
at
her
husband
but
you
must
come
down
and
talk
to
me
a
bit
lad
you
have
had
enough
of
him
and
his
old
books
you
never
saw
the
like
of
him
here
he
sits
day
after
day
over
his
musty
books
and
you
can
hardly
get
him
away
for
his
meals
he
no
company
for
any
one
talk
of
something
you
can
understand
lass
retorted
the
husband
in
a
voice
that
took
any
unkindness
from
the
words
rather
like
a
father
than
a
husband
you
do
ail
much
for
lack
of
company
i
sure
now
if
it
was
only
a
good
novel
his
wife
persisted
but
nothing
but
travels
geographies
and
such
like
last
thing
he
taken
up
with
is
the
stars
i
suppose
he
been
telling
you
about
them
and
she
said
this
half
as
though
it
were
a
new
form
of
lunacy
mr
tipping
had
developed
and
half
as
though
he
had
been
opening
up
new
realms
of
knowledge
original
but
useless
she
was
far
indeed
from
understanding
that
lonely
mind
and
its
tragedy
thirsting
so
hopelessly
for
knowledge
and
to
die
athirst
she
heard
him
knock
knock
all
day
upstairs
but
the
knocking
told
her
nothing
of
his
loneliness
he
was
just
a
good
rather
cross
old
man
unaccountably
fond
of
printed
matter
whom
she
liked
to
be
good
to
and
if
in
her
time
that
knocking
upstairs
should
stop
for
ever
well
she
was
one
to
meet
trouble
half
way
but
she
would
miss
it
a
good
deal
old
man
as
he
was
she
was
herself
nearing
fifty
but
her
slim
little
wiry
body
and
her
elfish
wrinkled
face
never
still
but
ever
alive
with
the
same
vivacity
that
years
ago
had
attracted
william
allsopp
made
her
seem
younger
than
her
years
and
her
husband
treated
her
as
though
she
were
still
a
child
a
wilful
child
eh
matilda
he
said
you
just
a
child
no
more
nor
less
just
a
child
the
years
have
tamed
you
one
bit
get
out
with
you
and
your
old
stars
she
said
laughing
henry
come
along
and
have
a
talk
with
your
old
aunt
though
invincibly
cheerful
through
it
all
aunt
tipping
was
always
in
trouble
if
not
for
herself
for
somebody
else
it
was
for
herself
though
it
was
but
a
minor
reverse
in
the
guerilla
warfare
of
her
life
a
distressed
lodger
who
had
just
left
had
begged
her
to
accept
in
lieu
of
rent
the
of
a
handsome
clock
which
had
been
hers
in
happier
days
and
mrs
tipping
moved
as
she
always
was
by
any
tale
of
woe
however
elaborate
had
consented
nor
in
her
world
was
such
a
way
of
settling
accounts
very
exceptional
for
were
there
looked
upon
as
legitimately
negotiable
securities
indeed
aunt
tipping
was
seldom
without
a
selection
of
such
securities
upon
her
hands
and
if
a
neighbour
should
chance
to
be
in
need
say
of
a
new
set
of
chimney
ornaments
as
likely
as
not
aunt
tipping
had
in
her
purse
a
pledge
for
the
very
thing
this
she
would
sell
at
a
reasonable
profit
which
would
probably
amount
to
but
a
small
proportion
of
the
original
debt
for
which
she
had
accepted
it
it
was
not
a
lucrative
business
though
there
were
occasional
bargains
in
it
in
that
word
bargains
all
the
active
romance
of
aunt
tipping
life
was
now
centred
in
all
departments
of
the
and
the
she
was
a
daring
speculator
and
a
spirited
auction
now
and
again
exhilarated
her
as
much
as
a
fortnight
by
the
sea
that
house
which
she
fought
so
desperately
to
keep
tidy
and
respectable
had
been
furnished
almost
entirely
in
this
way
there
was
hardly
an
article
in
it
that
had
not
already
lived
other
lives
in
other
houses
before
it
had
been
picked
up
dirt
cheap
by
aunt
tipping
but
this
afternoon
her
confidence
in
human
nature
had
received
a
cruel
wound
when
after
an
hour
weary
drag
to
a
remote
end
of
the
town
she
had
arrived
at
the
pawnshop
where
was
preserved
the
handsome
clock
of
the
distressed
lady
and
had
confidently
presented
the
ticket
and
the
necessary
money
the
man
had
looked
awhile
perplexed
they
had
no
such
clock
he
said
and
then
as
he
further
examined
the
ticket
a
light
broke
in
upon
him
my
dear
lady
he
said
look
here
the
year
on
this
ticket
has
been
changed
so
indeed
it
had
and
poor
aunt
tipping
was
at
least
a
year
too
late
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
treatment
she
said
to
henry
and
such
a
nice
lady
she
was
shall
never
forget
your
goodness
to
me
mrs
tipping
she
said
as
she
went
away
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
i
her
if
ever
i
catch
her
cheating
honest
folks
like
that
such
people
ought
to
be
allowed
i
do
know
how
people
can
behave
so
aunt
tipping
indignation
seldom
outlived
a
few
plaintive
words
of
this
sort
and
had
the
offending
lady
of
the
clock
appeared
next
moment
and
given
some
arabian
nights
explanation
there
is
little
doubt
that
aunt
tipping
would
have
forgiven
her
on
the
spot
a
tendency
to
do
so
was
already
active
in
her
next
remark
well
poor
soul
we
must
be
too
hard
on
her
we
never
know
what
we
may
be
brought
to
ourselves
for
it
was
aunt
tipping
unformulated
axiom
that
whatever
stories
misfortune
may
tell
there
is
always
some
truth
in
human
misery
when
henry
had
told
aunt
tipping
his
story
and
ventured
to
hint
a
suggestion
that
if
it
should
not
be
inconvenient
for
her
he
would
like
to
take
sanctuary
with
her
for
a
month
or
two
till
he
got
his
hopes
into
working
order
her
little
sharp
face
fairly
gleamed
with
delight
you
would
have
thought
that
he
was
bringing
her
some
great
benefit
instead
of
proposing
to
take
something
from
her
that
he
should
have
thought
of
such
a
little
humble
aunt
that
added
to
the
love
she
had
for
any
one
with
any
tincture
of
her
family
blood
running
in
their
veins
plus
her
general
weakness
for
any
one
in
trouble
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
that
made
her
look
quite
young
again
i
should
think
so
indeed
she
said
the
best
your
poor
old
got
is
yours
with
all
her
heart
ah
your
father
never
understood
you
you
got
too
much
of
our
side
of
the
family
in
you
you
a
bit
wild
you
know
lad
but
you
none
the
worse
for
that
eh
there
is
no
need
to
say
that
aunt
tipping
understanding
of
the
tastes
and
ambitions
which
had
driven
henry
momentarily
to
take
refuge
with
her
was
of
the
vaguest
but
all
she
needed
to
know
of
such
a
situation
was
that
here
on
the
one
hand
was
something
somebody
very
much
wanted
to
do
and
here
on
the
other
were
certain
stern
powers
ranked
against
his
doing
it
that
was
enough
for
her
her
sympathy
with
all
forms
of
revolt
was
instantaneous
for
law
and
order
as
such
she
had
an
instinctive
antipathy
as
in
all
contests
whatsoever
her
one
general
rule
was
side
with
the
weaker
and
it
can
not
but
have
been
perceived
that
so
much
sympathy
with
weakness
could
hardly
have
been
in
the
gift
of
weakness
no
aunt
tipping
was
entirely
impersonal
in
these
charities
of
feeling
and
it
was
because
there
was
so
much
sterling
honesty
and
strength
hidden
in
her
little
wiry
frame
that
she
could
afford
so
much
succour
to
those
who
were
neither
honest
nor
strong
well
it
was
nice
of
you
to
think
of
your
poor
old
aunt
she
repeated
again
and
again
and
then
she
remarked
on
the
good
fortune
which
had
caused
the
vacation
of
the
front
room
over
the
parlour
her
grievance
against
the
lady
of
the
handsome
clock
quite
forgotten
it
a
nice
airy
room
she
said
and
then
she
began
planning
how
she
might
best
arrange
it
for
his
comfort
dear
little
aunt
said
henry
taking
the
little
wisp
of
a
woman
into
his
arms
you
the
salt
of
the
earth
why
ever
did
i
think
of
it
before
exclaimed
aunt
tipping
presently
i
got
the
very
gentleman
to
help
you
with
your
writing
indeed
said
henry
somewhat
sceptical
yes
he
down
there
in
the
back
parlour
they
say
he
a
great
writer
continued
aunt
tipping
but
he
not
very
well
the
last
day
or
two
and
does
see
anybody
to
tell
the
truth
poor
gentleman
she
confided
lowering
her
voice
he
just
a
little
too
fond
of
his
glass
but
he
as
good
and
kind
a
gentleman
as
ever
stepped
and
always
regular
with
his
rent
every
monday
morning
there
was
usually
something
mysterious
about
aunt
tipping
lodgers
at
their
best
she
had
known
them
as
elaborately
wronged
of
aristocracy
many
of
them
were
lawful
expectants
of
illegally
delayed
fortunes
and
at
the
very
least
they
always
drank
romantically
thus
it
was
that
to
the
somewhat
amused
surprise
of
his
family
henry
came
to
take
up
his
abode
for
a
while
with
aunt
tipping
and
that
his
books
and
the
cast
of
dante
and
the
sketch
of
the
young
dante
done
in
sepia
by
myrtilla
williamson
own
fair
hand
came
to
find
themselves
in
the
incongruous
environment
of
tichborne
street
chapter
xxxii
the
literary
gentleman
in
the
back
parlour
aunt
tipping
proved
not
so
ludicrously
out
of
it
after
all
in
regard
to
the
literary
gentleman
in
the
back
parlour
henry
had
hardly
known
what
to
expect
but
certainly
he
had
pictured
no
one
so
interesting
as
ashton
gerard
proved
to
be
for
a
dark
den
smelling
strongly
of
whisky
and
water
and
some
slovenly
creature
of
the
crouched
in
a
dirty
armchair
over
the
fire
he
found
instead
a
pleasant
little
room
very
neatly
kept
with
books
two
or
three
good
pictures
and
general
evidence
of
cultivated
tastes
and
on
gerard
refined
sad
face
which
being
shaven
and
surmounted
by
a
tuft
of
vigorous
curly
hair
once
black
but
now
curiously
splashed
with
vivid
flakes
of
white
retained
something
of
boyish
beauty
even
at
forty
you
looked
in
vain
for
the
marks
of
one
who
was
in
the
grip
of
an
imperious
vice
only
by
the
marked
dimness
and
weariness
of
his
blue
eyes
which
gave
the
face
a
rather
helpless
dreamy
expression
might
the
experienced
observer
have
understood
so
to
speak
the
ocular
will
had
gone
out
of
them
they
no
longer
grasped
the
visible
but
glided
listlessly
over
it
nor
did
they
seem
to
be
looking
on
things
invisible
they
were
the
eyes
of
the
drowned
gerard
had
exceedingly
gentle
manners
it
was
easy
to
understand
that
a
landlady
would
worship
him
he
gave
little
trouble
asked
for
the
most
necessary
service
as
though
it
were
a
courtesy
and
never
forgot
an
interest
in
aunt
tipping
affairs
on
bright
days
he
revealed
a
vein
of
quite
boyish
gaiety
and
in
his
talk
with
henry
he
flashed
out
a
strange
paradoxical
humour
too
often
morbid
in
its
themes
which
as
usually
the
case
with
such
humour
was
really
sadness
coming
to
the
surface
in
a
jest
it
soon
transpired
that
a
favourite
subject
of
his
talk
was
that
very
weakness
which
most
men
would
have
been
at
pains
to
hide
so
you
going
to
be
a
poet
mesurier
he
said
well
so
was
i
once
so
was
i
but
he
continued
all
too
early
another
muse
took
hold
of
me
a
terrible
muse
yet
a
muse
who
never
forsakes
you
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
a
decanter
which
stood
near
him
on
the
table
yes
mesurier
the
terrible
muse
of
drink
you
may
be
surprised
to
hear
me
talk
so
yet
were
this
laudanum
instead
of
brandy
there
would
seem
to
you
a
certain
element
of
the
poetic
in
the
service
of
such
a
muse
drinks
with
oriental
or
unfamiliar
names
have
a
romantic
sound
thus
alfred
de
musset
as
the
slave
to
absinthe
sounds
much
more
poetic
than
say
alfred
de
musset
as
a
slave
to
rum
or
gin
or
even
this
brandy
here
yet
this
too
is
no
less
the
stuff
that
dreams
are
made
of
and
the
the
the
are
all
members
of
the
same
great
brotherhood
of
tragic
idealists
he
talked
deliberately
but
there
was
a
smile
playing
at
the
corners
of
the
mouth
which
took
from
his
talk
the
sense
of
a
painful
and
gave
it
the
air
of
a
playful
fantasia
upon
a
paradox
that
for
the
moment
amused
him
idealists
yes
he
continued
for
what
few
understand
is
that
drink
is
an
idealism
and
he
presently
added
with
a
laugh
and
of
course
like
all
idealisms
it
has
its
dangers
with
a
monomaniac
conversation
is
apt
to
limit
itself
to
monologue
so
while
henry
was
greatly
interested
in
this
odd
talk
it
left
him
but
little
to
say
i
afraid
i
shock
you
a
little
mesurier
perhaps
even
disgust
you
said
gerard
indeed
no
exclaimed
henry
but
both
the
subject
and
your
way
of
treating
it
are
i
confess
a
little
new
to
me
you
are
surprised
to
find
one
who
is
what
is
popularly
known
as
a
drunkard
not
so
much
ashamed
of
as
interested
in
himself
is
that
it
well
that
comes
of
the
introspective
literary
temperament
it
is
only
the
oyster
fascinated
by
the
pearl
that
is
killing
it
you
should
write
some
after
the
manner
of
de
quincey
said
henry
indeed
i
often
thought
of
it
for
there
so
much
that
needs
saying
on
the
subject
there
is
nothing
with
which
we
are
at
once
so
familiar
and
of
which
we
know
so
little
for
example
and
now
he
was
quite
plainly
off
again
for
example
the
passion
for
i
might
say
the
dream
of
drink
is
usually
regarded
as
a
sensual
appetite
a
physical
indulgence
no
doubt
in
its
first
crude
stages
it
often
is
so
but
soon
it
becomes
something
much
more
strange
and
abstract
it
becomes
a
mysterious
command
issuing
we
know
not
whence
it
is
hardly
a
desire
and
it
is
not
so
much
a
joyless
as
a
quite
colourless
obedience
to
an
imperious
necessity
decreed
by
some
unknown
will
you
might
well
imagine
that
i
like
the
taste
of
this
brandy
there
as
a
child
is
greedily
fond
of
sweetstuff
but
it
would
be
quite
a
mistake
for
my
own
personal
taste
there
is
no
drink
like
a
cup
of
tea
it
is
the
demon
the
strange
will
that
has
imposed
itself
upon
me
that
has
a
taste
for
brandy
i
sometimes
wonder
whether
we
poor
drunkards
are
not
the
victims
of
disembodied
powers
of
the
air
who
by
some
chance
have
contracted
a
craving
for
earthly
liquors
and
can
only
satisfy
that
craving
by
fastening
themselves
upon
some
unhappy
human
organism
at
times
there
comes
an
intermission
of
the
command
as
mysterious
almost
as
the
command
itself
for
weeks
together
we
give
no
thought
to
our
tyrant
we
grow
gay
and
young
and
innocent
again
we
are
free
so
free
we
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
we
were
ever
enslaved
then
suddenly
one
day
we
hear
the
call
again
we
cry
for
mercy
we
throw
ourselves
on
our
knees
in
prayer
we
clutch
sacred
relics
we
conjure
the
aid
of
holy
memories
we
say
over
to
ourselves
the
names
of
the
dead
we
have
loved
but
it
is
all
in
vain
surely
we
are
dragged
to
the
feet
of
that
inexorable
will
surely
we
submit
ourselves
once
more
to
the
dark
dominion
henry
listened
fascinated
and
a
little
frightened
the
longer
i
live
the
more
i
grow
convinced
that
this
is
no
mere
fancy
but
actual
science
gerard
continued
for
again
you
might
well
imagine
that
one
drinks
for
the
dreams
or
other
illusory
effects
it
is
said
to
produce
at
first
perhaps
yes
but
such
effects
speedily
pass
away
they
pass
away
indeed
before
the
tyranny
has
established
itself
while
it
would
still
be
possible
to
shake
it
off
no
the
dreams
of
drink
are
poor
things
not
worth
having
at
the
best
indeed
there
are
no
dreams
worth
having
believe
me
but
those
of
youth
and
health
and
and
gerard
passed
for
awhile
in
silence
into
some
hidden
country
of
his
lost
dreams
henry
gazed
at
him
with
a
curious
wonder
here
was
a
man
evidently
of
considerable
gifts
a
man
of
ideals
of
humour
a
man
witty
and
gentle
who
surely
could
have
easily
made
his
mark
in
the
world
and
yet
he
had
thrown
all
away
for
a
mechanical
habit
which
he
himself
did
not
pretend
to
be
a
passion
a
mere
abstract
attraction
as
though
a
man
should
say
i
care
not
for
the
joys
or
successes
of
this
world
my
destiny
is
to
sit
alone
all
day
and
count
my
fingers
and
toes
count
them
over
and
over
and
over
again
there
is
not
much
pleasure
in
it
and
i
should
be
glad
to
break
off
the
habit
but
there
it
is
it
is
imposed
upon
me
by
a
will
stronger
than
mine
which
i
must
obey
it
is
my
destiny
yes
idealists
said
gerard
presently
coming
back
from
his
dreams
to
his
great
subject
with
a
laugh
that
reminds
me
of
a
story
a
business
friend
of
mine
told
me
the
other
day
a
clerk
in
his
office
was
an
incorrigible
drunkard
he
was
quite
alone
in
the
world
and
had
no
one
dependent
upon
him
the
firm
had
been
lenient
to
him
and
again
and
again
forgiven
his
outbreaks
but
one
morning
they
called
him
in
and
said
here
jones
we
have
had
a
great
deal
of
patience
with
you
but
the
time
has
come
when
you
must
choose
between
the
drink
and
the
office
to
their
surprise
jones
instead
of
eagerly
promising
reform
looked
up
gravely
and
replied
you
give
me
a
week
to
think
it
over
sir
it
is
a
very
serious
matter
drink
was
all
the
poor
fellow
had
outside
his
drudgery
was
it
to
be
expected
that
he
should
thus
lightly
sacrifice
it
but
to
talk
about
something
else
your
aunt
mrs
tipping
who
has
a
great
idea
of
my
literary
importance
has
a
notion
that
i
may
be
of
some
help
to
you
mesurier
well
i
tell
you
the
whole
extent
of
my
present
literary
engagements
and
you
are
perfectly
at
liberty
to
laugh
at
the
present
time
i
do
the
sporting
notes
for
the
daily
and
i
write
the
theological
reviews
for
fleet
street
these
apparently
incongruous
occupations
are
the
relics
of
an
old
taste
for
sport
which
as
a
boy
in
the
country
i
had
ample
opportunity
for
indulging
and
of
an
interrupted
training
for
the
church
then
and
now
there
is
an
eventful
gap
which
if
you
do
mind
we
sadden
each
other
by
filling
let
us
fill
our
glasses
and
our
pipes
instead
and
having
failed
so
entirely
myself
i
will
give
you
minute
directions
how
to
succeed
in
literature
gerard
discourse
on
how
to
succeed
in
literature
was
partly
practical
and
partly
ironical
and
probably
too
technical
to
interest
the
general
reader
who
has
no
intention
of
being
a
great
or
a
little
writer
and
who
perhaps
has
already
found
gerard
previous
discourse
a
little
too
special
in
its
character
suffice
it
that
henry
heard
much
to
remember
and
much
to
laugh
over
and
that
gerard
concluded
with
a
practical
offer
of
kindness
i
do
know
how
much
use
it
may
be
to
you
he
said
but
if
you
care
to
have
it
i
should
be
very
glad
to
give
you
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
fleet
street
he
has
i
think
a
certain
regard
for
me
and
he
might
send
you
a
book
to
do
now
and
again
at
all
events
it
would
be
something
henry
embraced
the
offer
gratefully
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
in
a
day
or
two
time
there
was
a
five
days
excursion
running
from
tyre
to
london
and
back
for
why
not
take
it
and
expend
his
last
five
pounds
in
a
stimulating
glimpse
of
the
city
he
some
day
hoped
to
conquer
he
could
then
see
his
friend
the
publisher
present
his
letter
to
the
editor
and
perhaps
bring
home
with
him
some
little
work
and
a
renewed
stock
of
hopes
so
before
they
parted
that
night
gerard
wrote
him
the
letter
chapter
xxxiii
this
is
london
this
is
life
thus
it
was
that
all
unexpectedly
henry
found
himself
set
down
one
autumn
morning
at
the
homeless
hour
of
a
in
euston
station
he
was
going
to
stay
in
some
street
off
the
strand
and
chartered
a
hansom
to
take
him
there
few
great
cities
are
impressive
in
the
neighbourhood
of
their
railway
termini
you
enter
them
so
to
speak
by
the
back
door
and
london
waves
no
banners
of
bright
welcome
to
the
stranger
who
first
enters
it
by
the
euston
road
but
there
was
an
interesting
church
presently
and
on
a
close
by
henry
read
vestry
of
st
pancras
can
that
be
the
pancras
church
he
said
to
himself
where
mary
wollstonecraft
lies
buried
and
browning
was
married
then
as
they
drove
along
through
bloomsbury
the
name
great
coram
street
caught
his
eye
and
he
exclaimed
with
delight
why
where
thackeray
lived
for
a
time
great
coram
street
is
little
accustomed
to
create
such
excitement
in
the
breast
of
the
but
to
the
stranger
london
is
necessarily
first
a
museum
till
he
begins
to
love
it
as
a
home
and
in
addition
to
dead
men
associations
begins
to
people
it
with
memories
of
his
own
when
you
have
lived
awhile
in
gray
inn
you
grow
to
forget
that
ghost
is
your
and
it
is
the
provincial
who
from
time
to
time
lays
those
flowers
on
goldsmith
tomb
when
you
are
caught
in
a
block
on
westminster
bridge
with
only
five
minutes
to
get
to
waterloo
you
forget
to
say
to
yourself
ah
this
is
the
bridge
on
which
wordsworth
wrote
his
famous
sonnet
you
usually
say
something
quite
different
the
mere
names
of
the
streets
how
laden
with
immemorial
poetry
they
were
chancery
lane
how
wonderful
yet
the
poor
wretch
standing
outside
the
at
the
corner
seemed
to
derive
small
consolation
from
the
fact
that
he
was
starving
in
chancery
lane
but
to
henry
as
yet
london
was
an
extended
westminster
abbey
and
every
other
street
was
poet
corner
he
had
hardly
patience
to
breakfast
so
eager
was
he
to
be
out
in
the
streets
and
while
he
ate
his
eyes
were
out
of
the
windows
all
the
time
and
his
ears
drinking
in
all
the
london
morning
sounds
like
music
at
the
foot
of
the
street
ran
the
thames
he
had
caught
a
thrilling
glimpse
of
it
as
he
stepped
from
his
cab
and
had
had
a
childish
impulse
to
rush
down
to
it
before
entering
his
hotel
at
last
free
of
food
and
baggage
light
of
heart
and
brimming
over
with
youth
he
stepped
into
the
street
it
was
but
little
past
eight
he
had
just
heard
the
hour
chimed
in
various
tones
of
sweetness
and
solemnity
from
several
mellow
clocks
evidently
hidden
high
in
the
air
in
his
near
vicinity
for
two
or
three
hours
there
would
be
no
editor
or
publisher
to
be
seen
and
meanwhile
he
had
london
to
himself
he
stepped
out
into
it
as
into
a
garden
a
garden
of
those
flowers
in
which
antiquity
has
become
a
perfume
full
of
pictures
yes
there
was
the
thames
sweet
themmes
run
softly
till
i
end
my
song
he
quoted
to
himself
chaucer
spenser
elizabeth
thames
it
was
a
bright
morning
and
the
river
gleamed
to
advantage
the
tall
tower
of
westminster
glittered
richly
in
the
sun
and
the
long
front
of
somerset
house
wore
a
lordly
smile
the
embankment
gardens
sparkled
and
rustled
in
morning
freshness
henry
drew
in
the
air
of
london
as
though
it
had
been
a
rose
here
was
the
thames
at
the
foot
of
the
street
and
there
at
the
head
was
the
strand
a
stream
of
omnibuses
and
cabs
and
men
and
women
the
temple
must
be
somewhere
close
by
of
course
it
was
here
to
his
left
but
he
would
first
walk
quietly
by
the
thames
side
to
westminster
and
then
come
back
by
the
strand
as
he
walked
he
stepped
lightly
and
gently
as
though
reverent
to
the
very
stones
of
so
sacred
a
city
and
all
the
time
from
every
prospect
and
every
other
came
streaming
like
strains
of
music
magnetic
memories
streets
with
the
names
of
old
kings
strong
earls
and
warrior
saints
if
for
no
other
reason
how
important
for
the
future
of
a
nation
is
it
to
preserve
in
such
ancient
cities
as
london
and
oxford
the
energising
spectacle
of
a
noble
and
strenuous
antiquity
for
there
are
no
such
inspirers
of
young
men
as
these
old
places
so
much
strength
and
youth
went
into
them
long
ago
that
even
yet
they
have
strength
and
youth
to
give
and
from
them
as
from
the
strong
hills
pours
out
an
inexhaustible
potency
of
bracing
influence
at
last
henry
found
himself
back
at
the
of
his
street
he
had
walked
the
strand
with
deliberate
enjoyment
fleet
street
he
still
reserved
but
as
according
to
the
tower
of
clement
danes
it
was
only
just
ten
it
seemed
still
a
little
early
to
attack
his
business
a
florist
close
by
suggested
a
charming
commonplace
way
of
filling
the
time
he
would
buy
some
flowers
and
carry
them
to
goldsmith
grave
why
goldsmith
grave
should
thus
be
specially
honoured
he
a
little
wondered
he
was
conscious
of
loving
several
writers
quite
as
well
but
it
was
a
johnsonian
tradition
to
love
goldy
and
the
accessibility
of
his
made
sentiment
easy
he
repented
this
momentary
flippancy
of
thought
as
he
stood
in
the
cloistered
corner
where
goldsmith
sleeps
under
the
eye
of
the
law
and
when
he
laid
his
little
wreath
on
the
worn
stone
it
was
a
genuine
offering
from
it
he
turned
away
to
his
own
personal
dreams
by
eleven
he
had
found
his
friend
the
publisher
in
a
dainty
little
place
of
business
crammed
with
pottery
rowlandsons
and
books
and
more
like
a
than
a
for
the
publisher
proved
an
enthusiast
in
everything
that
was
beautiful
or
curious
and
had
indeed
taken
to
publishing
from
that
rare
motive
in
a
publisher
the
love
of
books
rather
than
the
love
of
money
he
was
aiming
to
make
his
little
shop
the
of
all
the
young
talent
of
the
day
and
as
young
talent
has
never
too
many
publishers
on
the
for
it
his
task
was
not
difficult
though
it
was
one
of
those
real
services
to
literature
which
such
publishers
and
booksellers
have
occasionally
done
in
our
literary
history
with
but
scant
acknowledgment
henry
was
pleased
to
find
that
he
looked
upon
him
to
make
one
of
his
little
band
of
youth
and
as
the
publisher
understood
the
art
of
encouragement
henry
already
felt
it
had
been
worth
while
to
come
to
london
just
to
see
him
he
knew
the
editor
to
whom
henry
had
a
letter
and
volunteered
him
another
the
afternoon
would
be
the
best
time
meanwhile
they
must
lunch
together
he
smiled
when
henry
suggested
the
cheshire
cheese
henry
had
a
sort
of
vague
idea
that
literary
men
could
hardly
think
of
taking
their
meals
anywhere
else
there
had
been
an
attempt
to
bring
it
into
fashion
again
the
publisher
said
but
it
had
come
to
nothing
though
he
for
one
loved
those
old
with
their
tankards
and
their
sanded
floors
so
to
the
cheshire
cheese
they
repaired
and
drank
to
a
long
friendship
in
foaming
pewters
of
porter
alas
said
henry
we
are
fallen
on
smaller
times
once
it
was
poet
pint
of
port
now
we
must
be
content
with
the
of
porter
you
must
come
to
my
rooms
said
the
publisher
and
be
introduced
to
some
of
our
young
men
i
have
one
or
two
of
our
older
critics
coming
too
henry
fortune
was
evidently
made
he
found
the
editor
in
a
dim
back
room
at
the
top
of
a
high
building
so
lost
in
a
world
of
books
and
dust
that
at
first
henry
could
hardly
make
him
out
writing
by
a
window
with
his
back
to
the
door
then
an
alert
head
turned
round
to
him
and
a
rather
peevish
gesture
bade
him
be
seated
while
the
editor
resumed
his
work
this
hardly
came
up
to
henry
magnificent
dreams
of
the
editorial
dignity
perhaps
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
editors
lived
in
palaces
and
sat
on
thrones
presently
the
editor
put
down
his
pen
with
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
and
the
first
impression
of
peevishness
vanished
in
the
cordiality
with
which
he
now
turned
to
his
visitor
you
must
excuse
my
absorption
it
was
a
rather
tough
piece
of
a
subject
i
rather
interested
in
new
welsh
dictionary
do
suppose
it
in
your
line
eh
eh
and
the
tall
spare
man
laughed
a
boyish
laugh
like
a
mischievous
bird
and
tossed
his
head
at
the
jest
his
face
was
small
and
sallow
and
tired
but
the
dark
eyes
were
full
of
fun
and
kindness
presently
he
rose
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
with
a
curious
prancing
walk
rolling
himself
a
cigarette
and
talking
away
in
a
rapid
jerky
fashion
with
his
continual
eh
eh
coming
in
all
the
time
poor
gerard
so
you
know
him
how
is
he
now
and
he
lowered
his
voice
with
the
suggestion
of
a
mutual
confidence
and
stopped
in
his
walk
till
henry
should
answer
poor
gerard
and
he
might
have
been
well
well
never
mind
we
were
together
at
king
brilliant
fellow
so
you
know
gerard
dear
me
dear
me
then
he
turned
to
the
subject
of
henry
visit
well
my
poor
boy
nothing
will
satisfy
you
but
literature
you
are
determined
to
be
a
literary
man
eh
eh
then
he
stopped
in
front
of
henry
and
laid
his
hand
kindly
on
his
shoulder
is
it
too
late
to
say
back
while
there
is
yet
time
perhaps
of
course
you
going
to
be
a
very
great
man
and
he
broke
off
into
his
walk
again
with
one
of
his
mischievous
laughs
but
unless
you
are
take
my
word
it
a
poor
game
yet
i
suppose
it
no
use
talking
i
know
wasted
breath
wasted
breath
well
now
what
can
you
do
and
by
the
way
you
wo
grow
fat
on
fleet
street
ten
shillings
a
column
is
our
magnificent
rate
of
payment
and
we
can
hardly
afford
that
then
he
began
pulling
out
one
book
and
another
from
the
piles
of
all
sorts
that
lay
around
him
i
suppose
like
the
rest
you
better
begin
on
poetry
there
a
tableful
over
there
go
and
take
your
pick
of
it
unless
of
course
you
got
some
special
subject
you
not
i
suppose
an
authority
on
assyriology
eh
eh
henry
feared
not
and
then
a
new
fit
of
industry
came
upon
the
editor
and
he
begged
henry
to
take
a
look
at
the
books
while
he
ran
through
another
proof
for
the
post
that
dusty
table
evidently
the
of
the
room
was
first
in
the
half
tragical
half
farcical
of
modern
literature
such
a
mass
of
foolishness
and
ineptitude
he
had
never
conceived
of
such
pretentiousness
too
and
while
he
made
various
melancholy
reflections
upon
human
vanity
what
should
he
unearth
suddenly
from
the
heap
but
his
own
little
volume
he
could
but
half
suppress
a
cry
of
recognition
what
that
asked
the
editor
not
turning
round
found
anything
no
said
henry
nothing
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
had
presently
he
had
made
a
small
pile
of
the
most
promising
volumes
and
turned
to
take
his
leave
the
editor
took
up
one
or
two
of
them
carelessly
not
much
here
i
afraid
he
said
never
mind
see
what
you
can
make
of
them
not
more
than
three
columns
at
the
most
you
know
and
come
and
see
me
again
i
glad
to
have
seen
you
oh
said
henry
on
the
point
of
leaving
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
own
little
book
may
i
take
this
one
too
it
not
worth
reviewing
but
it
rather
interested
me
just
now
god
bless
me
yes
certainly
said
the
editor
you
welcome
to
the
lot
if
you
care
to
bring
a
and
henry
slipped
his
poor
little
neglected
volume
into
his
pocket
on
how
many
dusty
tables
he
wondered
was
it
then
lying
ignominiously
disregarded
well
the
day
would
come
meanwhile
he
had
his
first
batch
of
books
for
review
chapter
xxxiv
the
wits
there
now
remained
the
gathering
of
wits
fixed
for
the
evening
his
publisher
had
asked
him
to
dinner
but
he
had
declined
from
a
secret
and
absurd
desire
to
dine
at
the
cock
this
he
gratified
and
with
his
mind
full
of
the
spacious
times
of
the
early
victorians
he
turned
into
the
publisher
little
room
about
nine
to
meet
some
of
the
later
there
was
no
great
muster
as
yet
some
rather
shy
young
men
spasmodically
picked
up
strange
drawings
or
books
lying
about
on
the
publisher
tables
struggled
maidenly
with
cigars
sipped
a
little
whisky
and
soda
but
little
was
said
among
them
a
lad
of
about
fifteen
miraculously
stood
with
his
back
to
the
but
soon
others
began
to
turn
in
and
by
ten
the
room
was
as
full
of
chatter
and
smoke
as
it
could
hold
not
least
conspicuous
among
the
talkers
was
the
boy
of
fifteen
henry
had
been
sitting
near
to
him
and
had
been
suddenly
startled
by
his
unexpectedly
breaking
out
into
a
volley
of
learning
delivered
in
a
voice
impressively
deliberate
and
sententious
what
a
remarkable
boy
that
is
said
henry
innocently
to
the
publisher
yes
but
he
not
quite
a
boy
though
he
young
enough
a
curious
little
creature
morbidly
learned
a
friend
of
mine
says
that
he
would
like
to
catch
him
and
keep
him
in
a
bottle
and
label
it
learned
homunculus
what
dialect
is
it
he
is
talking
in
said
henry
i
do
remember
to
have
heard
it
before
the
publisher
smiled
my
dear
fellow
you
must
be
careful
what
you
say
that
is
what
we
call
oxford
voice
how
remarkable
said
henry
his
attention
called
off
by
a
being
with
a
face
that
half
suggested
a
faun
and
half
suggested
a
flower
a
small
face
crowned
with
purply
black
hair
that
kept
falling
in
an
elflock
over
his
forehead
and
violet
eyes
set
he
was
talking
earnestly
of
fairies
in
a
beautiful
irish
accent
and
henry
liked
him
the
attraction
seemed
mutual
and
henry
found
himself
drawn
into
a
remarkable
relation
about
a
in
connemara
and
fairy
lights
that
for
several
nights
had
been
seen
glimmering
about
it
and
how
at
last
he
that
is
the
narrator
and
a
particularly
friend
of
his
had
kept
watch
one
moonlit
night
with
the
result
that
they
had
actually
seen
and
talked
with
the
queen
of
the
fairies
and
learned
many
secrets
of
the
the
narrator
here
made
use
of
a
long
unpronounceable
irish
word
which
henry
could
not
catch
i
should
have
explained
some
of
these
phenomena
to
you
whispered
the
publisher
presently
noticing
that
henry
looked
a
little
bewildered
this
is
a
young
irish
poet
who
in
the
intervals
of
his
raising
the
devil
writes
very
beautiful
lyrics
that
he
may
well
have
learned
from
the
fairies
it
is
his
method
to
seem
mad
on
magic
and
such
things
you
will
meet
with
many
strange
methods
here
do
be
alarmed
if
some
one
comes
and
talks
to
you
about
strange
sins
you
have
come
to
london
in
the
sins
period
i
will
explain
afterwards
he
had
hardly
spoken
when
a
pallid
young
man
with
a
preternatural
length
and
narrowness
of
face
began
to
talk
to
him
about
the
sins
of
the
borgias
i
suppose
you
never
committed
a
murder
yourself
he
asked
henry
languidly
no
said
henry
catching
the
spirit
of
the
foolishness
no
not
yet
i
am
keeping
that
implying
that
he
was
reserving
so
extreme
a
stimulant
till
all
his
other
vices
failed
him
presently
there
entered
a
tall
young
man
with
a
long
thin
face
curtained
on
either
side
with
enormous
masses
of
black
hair
like
a
slip
of
the
young
moon
glimmering
through
a
at
the
same
moment
there
entered
as
if
by
design
his
very
antithesis
a
short
firmly
built
clerkly
fellow
with
a
head
like
a
in
need
of
a
shave
a
big
brown
moustache
and
enormous
spectacles
that
said
the
publisher
referring
to
the
young
man
is
our
young
apostle
of
sentiment
our
new
man
of
feeling
the
man
we
have
and
the
other
is
our
young
apostle
of
blood
he
is
all
for
muscle
and
brutality
and
he
makes
all
the
money
it
is
one
of
our
many
fashions
just
now
to
sing
and
brutality
but
my
impression
is
that
our
young
man
of
feeling
will
have
his
day
though
he
will
have
to
wait
for
it
he
would
hasten
it
if
he
would
cut
his
hair
but
that
he
says
he
will
never
do
his
hair
he
says
is
his
well
he
enjoys
himself
and
loves
a
fight
though
you
might
think
it
to
look
at
him
a
supercilious
young
man
with
pink
cheeks
and
a
voice
which
his
admirers
compared
to
shelley
then
came
up
to
henry
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
mallarmé
latest
sonnet
but
finding
henry
confessedly
at
sea
turned
the
conversation
to
the
empire
ballet
of
which
unfortunately
henry
knew
as
little
the
conversation
then
languished
and
the
young
man
turned
elsewhere
for
sympathy
with
a
shrug
at
your
country
bumpkins
who
know
nothing
later
than
rossetti
in
the
thick
of
the
conversational
turmoil
henry
attention
had
from
time
to
time
been
attracted
by
the
noise
proceeding
from
a
blustering
man
with
a
face
of
fire
who
is
that
at
last
he
found
opportunity
to
ask
his
friend
that
is
our
greatest
critic
said
the
publisher
oh
said
henry
i
must
try
and
hear
what
he
is
saying
it
seems
important
from
the
way
he
is
listened
to
so
henry
listened
and
heard
how
the
man
said
the
word
damn
with
great
volubility
and
variety
of
cadence
and
other
words
to
the
same
effect
and
how
the
little
group
around
him
hung
upon
his
words
and
said
to
each
other
how
brilliant
how
absolute
henry
turned
to
his
friend
the
only
word
i
can
catch
is
the
word
he
said
that
said
the
publisher
with
a
laugh
is
the
of
fashionable
criticism
presently
a
little
talkative
man
came
up
and
said
that
he
hoped
mesurier
was
an
adherent
of
the
rightful
king
oh
of
course
said
henry
and
do
you
belong
to
any
secret
society
asked
the
little
man
henry
could
say
that
he
did
well
you
must
join
us
he
said
i
suppose
there
wo
be
a
rising
just
yet
asked
henry
realising
that
this
was
the
jacobite
method
not
just
yet
said
the
little
man
reassuringly
so
henry
was
enrolled
and
so
it
went
on
till
past
midnight
when
henry
at
last
escaped
to
talk
it
all
over
with
the
stars
the
evening
had
naturally
puzzled
him
as
a
man
will
always
be
puzzled
who
has
developed
under
the
influence
of
the
main
tendencies
of
his
generation
and
who
finds
himself
suddenly
in
a
backwater
of
fanciful
reaction
henry
in
his
simple
way
was
a
thinker
and
a
radical
and
he
had
nourished
himself
on
the
great
masters
of
english
literature
he
had
followed
the
lead
of
modern
philosophers
and
scientists
and
had
arrived
at
a
mystical
agnosticism
the
first
step
of
which
was
to
banish
the
dogmas
of
the
church
as
old
wives
tales
he
considered
that
he
had
inherited
the
gains
of
the
rationalists
but
he
came
to
london
and
found
young
men
feebly
playing
with
the
fire
of
that
romanism
which
he
regarded
as
at
once
the
most
childish
and
the
most
dangerous
of
all
intellectual
obsessions
in
an
age
of
great
biologists
and
electricians
he
came
upon
children
prettily
talking
about
fairies
and
the
philosopher
stone
in
one
of
the
greatest
ages
of
english
poetry
he
came
to
london
to
find
young
english
poets
falling
on
their
knees
to
the
metrical
mathematicians
of
france
in
the
great
age
of
democracy
a
fool
had
come
and
asked
him
if
he
were
not
a
supporter
of
the
house
of
stuart
a
jacobite
of
charades
but
only
once
had
he
heard
the
name
of
milton
it
was
the
learned
boy
of
fifteen
who
had
quoted
him
a
lifelong
debt
of
gratitude
and
never
once
had
he
heard
the
voice
of
simple
human
feeling
nor
heard
one
speak
of
beauty
simply
passionately
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
nor
of
love
with
his
heart
upon
his
sleeve
much
cleverness
much
learning
much
charm
there
had
been
but
he
had
missed
the
generous
human
impulse
no
one
seemed
to
be
doing
anything
because
he
must
these
were
pleasant
eddies
dainty
with
lilies
and
curiously
starred
but
the
great
warm
stream
of
english
literature
was
not
flowing
here
as
he
neared
his
hotel
he
thought
of
his
morning
visit
to
tomb
and
he
repented
the
little
with
which
he
had
bought
the
flowers
in
a
boyish
impulse
he
rang
the
temple
bell
and
found
his
way
again
to
the
lonely
corner
his
flowers
were
lying
there
in
the
moonlight
and
again
he
read
here
lies
oliver
goldsmith
forgive
me
goldy
he
murmured
well
may
men
bring
you
flowers
for
you
wrote
not
as
those
yonder
you
wrote
for
the
human
heart
chapter
xxxv
back
to
reality
it
was
good
to
get
back
to
reality
with
angel
blue
eyes
laugh
and
esther
common
sense
let
me
look
deep
into
them
angel

is
so
good
to
get
back
to
something

angel

them
very
wide

that
will
never
forsake
one
something
we
can
never
forsake
something
in
all
the
wide
world
change
that
will
never
change
something
that
will
still
be
angel
even
in
a
thousand
years
i
hope
to
be
a
real
angel
long
before
that
said
angel
laughing
do
you
think
you
can
promise
to
be
true
so
long
angel
asked
henry
dear
you
know
that
so
long
as
there
is
one
little
part
of
me
left
anywhere
in
the
world
that
part
will
be
true
to
but
come
tell
me
about
london
i
afraid
you
did
enjoy
it
very
much
oh
yes
i
loved
london
that
is
old
london
but
new
london
made
me
a
little
sad
i
expect
it
was
only
because
i
did
quite
understand
the
conditions
perhaps
so
said
angel
but
tell
me
did
you
go
to
the
zoo
you
dear
child
yes
i
went
out
of
pure
love
for
you
now
you
need
be
so
grown
up
you
know
you
wanted
to
go
just
for
yourself
as
well
and
you
saw
the
yes
and
the
lions
yes
and
the
snakes
yes
oh
i
give
anything
to
see
the
snakes
did
they
eat
any
rabbits
when
you
were
there
fascinate
them
and
then
draw
them
slowly
slowly
in
angel
what
terrible
interests
you
are
developing
no
thank
goodness
they
did
why
would
it
fascinate
you
to
see
something
wonderfully
killed
asked
angel
it
is
dreadful
and
wicked
of
course
but
it
would
be
so
thrillingly
real
i
think
i
must
introduce
you
to
a
young
man
i
met
in
london
said
henry
who
solemnly
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
murdered
anyone
you
savage
little
wild
thing
i
suppose
this
is
what
you
mean
by
saying
sometimes
that
you
are
a
gipsy
eh
well
and
you
went
to
the
tower
and
westminster
abbey
and
everything
and
it
was
really
wonderful
yes
i
saw
everything
including
the
queen
for
young
people
of
tyre
and
sidon
to
go
to
london
was
like
what
it
once
was
to
make
the
pilgrimage
to
rome
mike
created
some
valuable
nonsense
on
the
occasion
which
unfortunately
has
not
been
preserved
and
esther
was
disgusted
with
henry
because
he
could
give
no
intelligible
description
of
the
latest
london
hats
and
all
examined
with
due
reverence
those
wonderful
books
for
review
in
tichborne
street
aunt
tipping
had
taken
advantage
of
his
absence
to
enrich
his
room
with
a
bargain
in
the
shape
of
an
old
desk
which
was
the
very
thing
he
wanted
dear
old
aunt
tipping
and
gerard
it
is
to
be
feared
took
a
little
more
brandy
than
usual
in
honour
of
his
young
friend
adventures
in
the
capital
these
excitements
over
henry
sat
down
at
his
old
desk
to
write
his
first
review
and
there
for
the
present
we
may
leave
him
for
he
took
it
very
seriously
and
was
dangerous
to
interrupt
chapter
xxxvi
the
old
home
meanwhile
more
than
a
year
had
now
gone
by
since
henry
left
home
and
meanwhile
with
the
exception
of
dot
baptism
there
had
been
no
exciting
changes
to
record
perhaps
uneventfulness
is
part
of
the
security
of
a
real
home
every
morning
james
mesurier
had
risen
at
six
though
he
no
longer
imposed
that
hour
of
rising
upon
his
daughters
breakfasted
at
eight
and
reached
his
office
at
nine
every
evening
during
those
months
punctually
at
six
his
had
rattled
in
the
lock
and
one
or
other
of
his
daughters
had
hurried
out
at
the
sound
to
bid
him
welcome
home
home
at
last
father
dear
they
had
said
helping
him
off
with
his
coat
and
sometimes
when
he
felt
bright
he
would
answer
yes
my
dear
night
brings
crows
home
home
again
james
his
wife
would
say
as
he
next
entered
the
front
parlour
and
bent
down
to
kiss
her
where
she
sat
it
a
long
day
is
it
time
you
were
pulling
in
a
bit
surely
some
of
the
younger
heads
should
begin
to
relieve
you
responsibility
mary
dear
we
can
not
delegate
responsibility
he
would
answer
but
we
see
nothing
of
you
you
just
sacrifice
your
whole
life
for
the
business
if
he
were
in
a
good
humour
he
might
answer
with
one
of
his
rare
sweet
laughs
and
jokingly
make
one
of
his
few
french
quotations
est
la
my
dear
est
la
that
the
french
for
it
is
it
dot
james
mesurier
was
just
perceptibly
softening
perhaps
it
was
that
he
was
growing
a
little
tired
that
he
was
no
longer
quite
the
stern
disciplinarian
we
met
in
the
first
chapter
perhaps
the
influence
of
his
wife
and
his
experiences
with
his
children
were
beginning
to
hint
to
him
what
it
takes
so
long
for
a
strong
individual
nature
to
learn
that
the
law
of
one
temperament
can
not
justly
or
fruitfully
be
enforced
as
the
law
of
another
the
younger
children
esther
and
dot
and
mat
used
sometimes
to
say
to
each
other
would
grow
up
in
a
more
clement
atmosphere
of
home
than
had
been
henry
and
theirs
already
they
were
quietly
assuming
privileges
and
nothing
said
that
would
have
meant
beatings
for
their
elders
for
these
things
had
henry
and
esther
gladly
faced
martyrdom
henry
had
looked
on
the
promised
land
but
been
denied
an
entrance
there
by
his
stripes
this
younger
generation
would
be
healed
the
elder
girls
hastened
to
draw
close
to
their
father
in
gratitude
and
home
breathed
a
kinder
freer
air
than
ever
had
been
known
before
between
esther
and
her
father
particularly
a
kind
of
comradeship
began
to
spring
up
which
perhaps
more
than
ever
made
the
mother
miss
her
boy
but
all
the
same
home
was
growing
old
this
was
the
kindness
of
the
setting
sun
childless
middle
age
is
no
doubt
often
dreary
to
contemplate
yet
is
it
an
egoistical
bias
which
leads
one
to
find
in
such
limitation
or
one
might
rather
say
preservation
of
the
ego
a
certain
compensation
the
childless
man
or
woman
has
at
least
preserved
his
or
her
individuality
as
few
fathers
and
mothers
of
large
families
are
suffered
to
do
by
the
time
you
are
fifty
with
a
family
of
half
a
dozen
children
you
have
become
comparatively
impersonal
as
father
or
mother
it
is
tacitly
recognised
that
your
is
finished
that
your
ambitions
are
accomplished
or
not
and
that
your
hopes
are
at
an
end
the
young
mesuriers
for
example
were
all
eagerly
hastening
towards
their
several
futures
they
were
garrulous
over
them
at
every
meal
but
to
what
future
in
this
world
were
james
and
mary
mesurier
looking
forward
love
had
blossomed
and
brought
forth
fruit
but
the
fruit
was
quickly
ripening
and
stranger
hands
would
soon
pluck
it
from
the
boughs
in
a
very
few
years
they
would
sit
under
a
bared
of
fruit
and
blossom
and
sad
with
falling
leaves
they
had
dreamed
their
dream
and
there
is
only
one
such
dream
for
a
lifetime
now
they
must
sit
and
listen
to
the
dreams
of
their
children
help
them
to
build
theirs
they
mattered
now
no
longer
for
themselves
but
just
as
so
much
aid
and
sympathy
on
which
their
children
might
draw
too
well
in
their
hearts
they
knew
that
their
children
only
heard
them
with
patience
so
long
as
they
talked
of
their
should
they
sometimes
dwell
wistfully
on
their
own
yesterdays
they
could
too
plainly
see
how
long
the
story
seemed
est
la
vie
as
james
mesurier
said
and
that
being
so
no
wonder
life
is
a
sad
business
better
perhaps
be
childless
and
retain
one
own
personal
hopes
and
fears
for
life
than
be
so
relegated
to
history
in
the
very
zenith
of
one
days
if
only
this
younger
generation
at
the
door
were
always
as
it
assumes
stronger
and
better
than
its
elder
but
though
the
careless
assumption
that
it
is
so
is
somewhat
general
history
alone
shows
how
false
and
impudent
the
assumption
often
is
too
often
genius
itself
must
submit
to
the
silly
presumption
of
its
noisy
and
fatuous
children
and
it
is
the
young
fool
who
too
often
knocks
imperiously
at
the
door
of
wise
and
active
middle
age
that
all
this
is
inevitable
makes
it
none
the
less
sad
the
young
mesuriers
were
neither
fools
nor
hard
of
heart
and
sometimes
in
moments
of
sympathy
their
parents
would
be
revealed
to
them
in
sudden
lights
of
pathos
and
old
romance
they
would
listen
to
some
old
of
their
mother
as
though
it
had
been
their
own
or
go
out
of
their
way
to
make
their
father
tell
once
more
the
epic
of
the
great
business
over
which
he
presided
and
which
as
he
conceived
it
was
doubtless
a
greater
poem
than
his
son
would
ever
write
yet
still
even
in
such
genuine
sympathy
there
was
a
certain
imaginative
effort
to
be
made
the
gulf
between
the
generations
however
hidden
for
the
moment
was
always
there
yet
after
all
james
and
mary
mesurier
possessed
an
incorruptible
treasure
which
their
children
had
neither
given
nor
could
take
away
to
regard
them
as
without
future
would
be
a
shallow
observation
for
love
has
always
a
future
however
old
in
mortal
years
it
may
have
grown
and
as
they
grew
older
their
love
seemed
to
grow
stronger
involuntarily
they
seemed
to
draw
closer
together
as
by
an
instinct
of
their
love
had
been
before
their
children
were
they
to
be
spared
it
would
still
be
the
same
love
sweeter
by
trial
when
their
children
had
passed
from
them
in
this
love
had
been
wise
for
them
some
parents
love
their
children
so
unwisely
that
they
forget
to
love
each
other
and
when
the
children
forsake
them
are
left
disconsolate
one
has
heard
young
mothers
say
that
now
their
boy
has
come
their
husbands
may
take
a
second
place
and
often
of
late
we
have
heard
the
woman
say
give
me
but
the
child
and
the
lover
can
go
his
ways
foolish
unprophetic
women
let
but
twenty
years
go
by
and
how
glad
you
will
be
of
that
rejected
lover
for
though
a
son
may
suffice
for
his
mother
what
mother
has
ever
sufficed
for
her
son
but
though
sometimes
as
they
looked
at
their
parents
the
young
mesuriers
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
infinite
sadness
of
a
accomplished
yet
it
failed
to
warn
them
against
the
eager
haste
with
which
they
were
hurrying
on
towards
a
like
conclusion
too
late
they
would
understand
that
all
the
joy
was
in
the
doing
too
soon
say
to
themselves
was
it
for
this
that
our
little
world
shook
with
such
fiery
commotion
and
molten
ardours
that
this
present
should
be
so
firm
and
insensitive
beneath
our
feet
this
habit
why
it
was
once
a
passion
this
fact
why
it
was
once
a
dream
oh
why
shake
off
youth
fragile
blossoms
with
the
very
speed
of
your
own
impatience
why
make
such
haste
towards
autumn
who
ever
thought
the
ruddiest
lapful
of
apples
a
fair
exchange
for
a
cloud
of
sunlit
blossom
whose
maturity
however
laden
with
prosperity
or
gilded
with
honour
ever
kept
the
fairy
promise
of
his
youth
for
so
brief
a
space
youth
glitters
like
a
dewdrop
on
the
tree
of
life
glitters
and
is
gone
for
one
desperate
instant
of
perfection
it
hangs
poised
and
is
seen
no
more
but
alas
the
art
of
enjoying
youth
with
a
wise
economy
is
only
learnt
when
youth
is
over
it
is
perhaps
too
paradoxical
an
accomplishment
to
be
learnt
before
for
a
youth
that
economised
itself
would
be
already
middle
age
it
is
just
the
wasteful
flare
of
it
that
leaves
such
a
dazzle
in
old
eyes
as
they
look
back
in
fancy
to
the
conflagration
of
fragrant
fire
which
once
bourgeoned
and
sang
where
these
white
ashes
now
slowly
smoulder
towards
extinction
when
mike
has
a
theatre
of
his
own
and
can
send
boxes
to
his
friends
when
henry
maybe
is
an
editor
of
power
when
esther
and
angel
are
the
enthroned
wives
of
famous
men
and
the
new
heaven
and
the
new
earth
are
quite
finished
will
they
never
sigh
sometimes
to
have
the
making
of
them
all
over
again
then
they
will
have
everything
to
enjoy
so
there
will
be
nothing
left
to
hope
for
then
there
will
be
no
spice
of
peril
in
their
loves
no
keen
edge
that
comes
of
enforced
denial
and
the
game
of
life
will
be
too
sure
for
ambition
to
keep
its
savour
there
is
no
thrill
no
excitement
nowadays
one
can
almost
fancy
their
saying
and
like
children
playing
with
their
bricks
now
let
us
knock
it
all
down
and
build
another
one
it
will
be
such
fun
however
these
are
intrusive
autumnal
thoughts
in
this
book
of
simple
youth
and
our
young
people
knew
them
not
they
were
far
indeed
from
esther
mind
as
she
talked
with
dot
of
the
future
one
afternoon
instead
her
words
were
full
of
impatience
with
the
slow
march
of
events
and
the
enforced
inactivity
of
a
girl
life
at
home
it
is
so
much
easier
for
the
boys
she
was
saying
there
is
something
for
them
to
do
but
we
can
do
nothing
but
sit
at
home
and
wait
darn
their
socks
and
clap
our
hands
at
their
successes
i
wish
i
were
a
man
no
you
do
said
dot
for
then
you
could
marry
mike
and
you
could
wear
pretty
dresses
oh
and
lots
of
things
i
do
much
envy
a
man
life
after
all
it
all
very
well
talking
about
hard
work
when
you
have
got
to
do
it
and
it
not
so
much
the
work
as
the
responsibility
it
must
be
such
a
responsibility
to
be
a
man
of
course
you
right
dot
but
oh
this
waiting
is
so
stupid
all
the
same
if
only
i
could
be
doing
something
anything
well
you
doing
something
is
it
nothing
to
be
all
the
world
to
a
man
said
dot
wistfully
nothing
to
be
his
heaven
upon
earth
nothing
to
be
the
prize
he
is
working
for
and
nothing
to
sustain
and
cheer
him
on
as
you
do
mike
and
as
angel
cheers
henry
would
henry
have
been
the
same
without
angel
or
mike
the
same
without
you
no
the
man
work
makes
more
noise
but
the
woman
work
is
none
the
less
real
and
useful
because
it
is
quiet
and
underground
dear
dot
what
a
wise
old
thing
you
growing
but
you
know
longing
all
the
time
for
some
work
to
do
yourself
did
you
say
the
other
day
that
you
seemed
to
be
wasting
your
life
here
making
beds
and
doing
housework
yes
but
i
different
do
you
see
retorted
dot
sadly
i
got
no
mike
your
work
is
to
help
mike
be
a
great
actor
but
i
got
no
one
to
help
be
anything
you
may
be
sure
i
would
complain
of
being
idle
if
i
had
i
think
you
a
bit
forgetful
sometimes
how
happy
you
are
poor
old
dot
you
need
talk
as
if
you
such
a
desperate
old
maid
you
not
twenty
yet
and
i
sure
it
a
good
thing
for
you
that
you
have
got
any
of
the
young
men
about
here
to
help
be
aldermen
wait
till
you
come
and
stay
with
us
in
london
then
soon
find
some
one
to
work
for
as
you
call
it
i
do
know
said
dot
thoughtfully
somehow
i
think
i
shall
never
marry
i
suppose
you
mean
you
rather
be
a
nun
or
something
serious
of
that
sort
well
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
been
thinking
lately
if
perhaps
i
could
do
something
perhaps
go
into
a
hospital
or
something
of
that
sort
oh
nonsense
dot
think
of
all
the
horrible
dirty
people
you
have
to
attend
to
ugh
christ
did
think
of
that
when
he
washed
the
feet
of
his
disciples
said
little
dot
sententiously
why
dot
how
dreadfully
religious
you
getting
you
want
a
good
shaking
besides
is
it
a
little
impious
to
imply
that
the
apostles
were
horrible
dirty
people
you
know
what
i
meant
said
dot
flushing
yes
of
course
dear
and
i
think
i
know
where
you
been
you
been
to
see
that
dear
sister
agatha
you
admit
she
a
dear
of
course
i
do
but
i
do
know
whether
she
quite
good
for
you
if
you
only
seen
her
among
the
poor
little
children
the
other
day
how
beautiful
and
how
happy
she
looked
you
might
have
thought
differently
said
dot
oh
yes
dear
but
then
you
must
forget
that
her
point
of
view
is
different
she
renounced
the
world
she
one
of
those
women
esther
could
resist
adding
maliciously
who
given
up
hope
of
man
and
so
have
set
all
their
hopes
on
god
esther
that
unworthy
of
you
though
what
if
it
is
as
you
say
is
it
so
great
a
failure
after
all
to
dedicate
one
self
to
god
rather
than
to
one
little
individual
man
oh
come
said
esther
rather
wilfully
misunderstanding
and
suddenly
flushing
up
mike
is
not
so
little
as
all
that
why
you
goose
how
earthly
you
are
i
never
thought
of
dear
mike
though
it
would
have
served
you
right
for
saying
such
a
mean
thing
about
sister
agatha
forgive
me
i
know
it
was
mean
but
i
could
resist
it
and
it
is
true
you
admit
of
some
of
those
pious
women
though
i
withdraw
it
about
sister
agatha
of
course
i
could
be
a
sister
like
sister
agatha
said
dot
without
being
a
catholic
as
well
but
i
might
be
a
nurse
at
one
of
the
ordinary
hospitals
it
would
be
dreadfully
hard
work
said
esther
harder
than
being
a
man
do
you
think
asked
dot
laughing
for
goodness
sake
do
turn
catholic
said
esther
in
some
alarm
would
break
father
heart
if
you
like
a
horror
of
catholicism
ran
in
the
very
marrow
of
these
young
people
it
was
one
of
the
few
relics
of
their
father
puritanism
surviving
in
them
of
catholics
they
had
been
accustomed
to
speak
since
childhood
as
of
nightmares
and
red
indians
with
bloody
scalps
at
their
waists
and
perhaps
that
instinctive
terror
of
the
subtle
heart
of
rome
is
the
religious
prejudice
which
we
will
do
well
to
part
with
last
dot
had
not
indeed
contemplated
an
apostacy
so
unnatural
but
beneath
these
comparatively
trivial
words
there
was
an
impulse
to
fulfil
that
old
longing
of
her
nature
to
do
something
as
the
christians
would
say
for
god
something
serious
in
return
for
the
solemn
and
beautiful
gift
of
life
by
an
accident
she
had
met
sister
agatha
one
day
in
the
house
of
an
old
irish
servant
of
theirs
who
had
been
compelled
to
leave
them
on
account
of
and
on
whom
she
had
called
with
a
little
present
of
fruit
she
had
been
struck
by
the
sweetness
of
the
sister
face
as
the
sister
had
been
struck
by
hers
sister
agatha
had
invited
dot
to
visit
her
some
day
at
the
home
for
orphan
children
of
which
she
had
charge
and
with
some
misgiving
as
to
whether
it
was
right
thus
to
visit
a
catholic
whether
even
it
was
safe
dot
had
accepted
so
an
acquaintance
had
grown
up
and
ripened
into
a
friendship
and
sister
agatha
while
making
no
attempt
to
turn
the
friendship
to
the
account
of
her
church
was
a
great
consolation
to
the
lonely
religious
girl
dot
retained
too
much
rationalism
ever
to
become
a
catholic
but
the
longing
to
do
something
grew
and
grew
at
a
certain
moment
with
each
new
generation
of
girls
there
comes
an
epidemical
desire
in
maiden
bosoms
to
dedicate
their
sweet
young
lives
to
the
service
of
what
esther
called
horrible
dirty
people
at
these
periods
the
hospitals
are
flooded
with
applications
from
young
girls
whom
the
vernal
equinox
urges
first
to
be
mothers
and
failing
motherhood
nurses
just
before
she
met
henry
angel
had
done
her
best
to
miss
him
by
frantic
endeavours
to
nurse
people
whom
the
hospital
doctors
decided
she
was
far
too
slight
a
thing
to
lift
for
unless
you
can
lift
your
patients
not
to
say
throw
them
about
you
fail
in
the
muscular
qualifications
of
a
hospital
nurse
dot
as
we
have
seen
was
impelled
in
this
direction
from
no
merely
sentimental
impulse
unless
the
religious
impulse
which
paradoxically
makes
nuns
of
disappointed
mothers
may
so
be
called
perhaps
unacknowledged
deep
down
in
her
heart
she
longed
to
be
the
nurse
of
one
little
wonderful
child
had
this
been
granted
her
it
is
probable
that
the
maimed
and
the
halt
would
have
had
less
attraction
for
her
pitying
imagination
as
it
was
however
she
persuaded
herself
that
she
loved
them
was
it
because
at
the
moment
no
one
else
seemed
to
need
her
love

laflin
esther
impatience
was
to
be
appeased
perhaps
a
little
to
her
regret
after
all
by
an
unexpected
remission
of
the
time
appointed
between
mike
and
his
first
real
engagement
suddenly
one
day
came
an
exciting
letter
from
the
great
actor
saying
that
he
saw
his
way
to
giving
him
a
part
in
his
own
london
company
if
he
could
join
him
for
rehearsal
in
a
week
time
here
was
news
at
last
a
of
the
new
heaven
was
to
be
laid
in
a
week
time
mike
would
be
working
at
one
of
the
alabaster
walls
perhaps
in
two
years
time
perhaps
even
in
a
year
with
good
fortune
the
roof
would
be
on
the
door
wreathed
with
garlands
and
a
modest
little
heaven
ready
for
occupation
now
all
that
remained
was
to
make
the
momentous
break
with
the
old
life
old
laflin
had
been
left
in
peaceful
ignorance
of
the
mine
which
must
now
be
exploded
beneath
his
evening
armchair
mike
loved
his
father
and
this
had
been
a
dread
long
and
wisely
postponed
but
now
when
the
moment
for
inevitable
decision
had
come
mike
remembered
with
a
certain
shrinking
that
responsibility
of
which
dot
had
spoken
the
responsibility
of
being
a
man
it
was
his
dream
to
be
an
actor
to
earn
his
bread
with
joy
to
earn
it
with
less
than
joy
seemed
unworthy
of
man
yet
there
was
another
dream
for
him
still
more
immeasurably
more
important
to
be
esther
husband
if
he
stayed
where
he
was
in
slow
revolutions
of
a
dull
business
his
father
place
and
income
would
become
his
if
he
renounced
that
certain
prospect
he
committed
himself
to
a
destiny
of
brilliant
chances
and
for
the
first
time
he
realised
that
among
those
chances
lurked
too
the
chance
of
failure
esther
must
decide
and
henry
counsel
too
must
be
taken
mike
thought
he
knew
what
the
decision
and
the
counsel
would
be
and
of
course
he
was
not
mistaken
why
mike
how
can
you
hesitate
said
esther
fail
if
you
like
and
i
shall
still
love
you
but
you
do
surely
think
i
could
go
on
loving
a
man
who
was
frightened
to
try
that
was
a
little
hard
of
esther
for
mike
fear
had
been
for
her
sake
not
his
own
however
that
and
the
even
more
vehement
counsel
of
henry
had
the
desired
bracing
effect
and
mike
nerved
himself
to
deal
the
necessary
blow
at
his
father
tranquillity
as
the
writer
of
this
book
takes
no
special
joy
in
scenes
with
fathers
the
painful
and
somewhat
violent
scene
with
laflin
is
here
omitted
and
left
to
the
imagination
of
any
reader
with
a
taste
for
such
unnatural
collisions
any
one
over
thirty
will
agree
that
all
the
reason
was
on
laflin
side
as
all
the
instinct
was
on
his
son
luckily
for
mike
the
instinct
was
to
prove
genuine
and
his
father
to
live
to
be
prouder
of
his
rebellion
than
ever
he
would
have
been
of
his
obedience
this
scene
over
it
was
only
a
matter
of
days
five
alone
were
left
before
mike
must
up
and
away
in
right
good
earnest
oh
mike
said
esther
you
sure
you
go
on
loving
me
awfully
frightened
of
those
pretty
girls
in
company
you
need
be
said
mike
there
only
one
girl
in
the
world
will
look
at
a
funny
bit
of
a
thing
like
me
oh
i
do
know
said
esther
laughing
some
big
girls
have
such
strange
tastes
well
let
hope
that
before
many
months
you
can
come
and
look
after
me
if
we
only
a
certain
five
pounds
a
week
we
could
get
along
anything
to
be
together
of
course
we
have
to
be
economical
said
esther
thoughtfully
on
the
last
night
but
one
before
his
leaving
it
was
mike
turn
for
a
farewell
dinner
of
his
best
friends
assembled
at
the
golden
bee
and
toasts
and
tears
were
mingled
to
do
him
honour
henry
happily
caught
the
general
feeling
of
the
occasion
in
the
following
verses
not
hitherto
printed
henry
was
too
much
in
earnest
at
the
time
to
regard
the
bathos
of
rhyming
stage
waits
with
such
dignities
as
summoning
fates
except
for
which
the
poem
is
perhaps
not
a
bad
example
of
sincere
occasional
verse
mike
at
last
the
wishéd
hour
draws
nigh
weary
indeed
the
watching
of
a
sky
for
golden
portent
tarrying
afar
but
here
we
hail
your
risen
star
we
hear
the
cry
of
summoning
fates
stage
waits
stage
waits
and
we
who
love
our
brother
so
would
keep
him
not
but
only
ere
he
go
led
by
the
stars
along
the
untried
ways
we
hold
his
hand
in
ours
a
little
space
with
grip
of
love
that
girdeth
up
the
heart
and
kiss
of
eyes
that
giveth
strength
to
part
some
of
your
lovers
may
be
half
afraid
to
bid
you
forth
for
fear
of
pitfalls
laid
about
your
feet
but
we
have
no
such
fears
that
cry
is
as
a
trumpet
in
our
ears
we
dare
not
would
not
mock
those
summoning
fates
stage

stage

and
shall
you
fear
and
make
delay
yes
when
the
mariner
who
long
time
lay
waiting
the
breeze
shall
anchor
when
it
blows
yes
when
a
thirsty
shall
close
against
the

or
when
in
reaping
days
the

shall
set
his
fields

nay
take
your

and
while
you
can
make

of
your
grain
the
land
is
fair
to
which
that

flower
is
sweet
the
rain
shall
set

gates
stage

stage

and
we
must
loosen
now
your
hand
and
miss
your
face
gold
in
all
our
land
but
yet
we
know
that
in
a
little
while
you
come
again
a
conqueror
so
smile
godspeed
not
parting
and
with
hearts
elate
we
yes
for
the
second
time
the
die
was
cast
henry
was
already
afoot
on
the
adventure
perilous
now
it
was
mike
turn
these
young
people
had
passionately
invoked
those
terrible
gods
who
fulfil
our
dreams
and
already
the
celestial
machinery
was
beginning
to
move
in
answer
perhaps
it
just
a
little
took
their
breath
to
see
the
great
wheels
so
readily
turning
at
the
touch
of
their
young
hands
but
they
were
in
for
it
now
and
with
stout
hearts
must
abide
the
issue
this
was
to
be
esther
and
mike
first
experience
of
parting
and
their
hearts
sickened
at
the
thought
love
surely
does
well
in
this
world
so
full
of
snares
and
dangers
to
fear
to
lose
from
its
eyes
for
a
moment
the
face
of
its
beloved
and
in
this
respect
the
courage
of
love
is
the
more
remarkable
how
bravely
it
takes
the
appalling
risks
of
life
to
separate
for
an
hour
may
mean
that
never
as
long
as
the
world
lasts
will
love
hear
the
voice
it
loves
again
love
has
called
gaily
so
often
and
waved
hands
from
the
threshold
and
the
beloved
has
called
and
waved
and
smiled
back
for
the
last
time
and
yet
love
faces
the
fears
not
only
of
hours
but
of
weeks
and
months
weeks
and
months
on
seas
bottomless
with
danger
in
lands
rife
with
unknown
evils
dizzily
taking
the
chances
of
desperate
occupations
and
the
courage
is
the
greater
because
finally
in
this
world
love
alone
has
anything
to
lose
other
losses
may
be
more
or
less
repaired
but
love
loss
is
of
its
essence
irreparable
other
fair
faces
and
brave
hearts
the
world
may
bring
us
but
never
that
one
face
alas
for
the
most
precious
of
earthly
things
the
only
precious
thing
of
earth
there
is
no
system
of
insurance
the
many
waters
have
quenched
love
and
the
floods
drowned
it
yet
in
the
wide
world
is
there
no
help
no
hope
no
recompense
the
love
that
bound
this
little
circle
of
young
people
together
was
so
strong
and
warm
that
it
had
developed
in
them
an
almost
painful
sensibility
to
such
risks
of
loss
so
it
was
that
expressions
of
affection
and
outward
endearments
were
more
current
among
them
than
is
usual
in
a
land
where
manners
from
a
proper
fear
of
exaggeration
run
to
a
silly
extreme
of
unresponsiveness
they
never
met
without
showing
their
joy
to
be
again
together
never
parted
without
that
inner
fear
that
this
might
be
their
last
chance
of
showing
their
love
for
each
other
you
all
say
as
if
you
were
going
to
america
myrtilla
williamson
had
once
said
i
suppose
it
your
irish
grandmother
and
no
doubt
the
had
its
odd
side
for
those
who
saw
only
the
surface
thus
for
those
who
love
love
who
love
to
watch
for
it
on
human
faces
mike
at
the
railway
station
was
a
sight
worth
going
far
to
see
my
word
they
seem
to
be
fond
of
each
other
these
young
people
said
a
lady
standing
at
the
door
of
the
next
carriage
mike
was
leaning
through
the
window
and
esther
was
pressing
near
to
him
they
murmured
low
to
each
other
and
their
eyes
were
bright
with
tears
a
little
apart
stood
a
small
group
in
which
henry
and
angel
and
ned
were
conspicuous
and
mike
sisters
and
dot
and
mat
were
there
a
callous
observer
might
have
laughed
so
sad
and
solemn
they
were
fun
tried
a
rally
but
his
jests
fell
spiritless
it
was
not
so
much
a
parting
one
might
have
thought
as
a
funeral
little
was
said
but
eyes
were
eloquent
either
with
tears
or
with
long
strong
glances
that
meant
undying
faithfulness
all
round
and
mike
knew
that
henry
eyes
were
quoting
after
the
great
companions
and
to
belong
to
them
henry
will
to
achieve
was
too
strong
for
him
to
think
of
this
as
a
parting
he
could
only
think
of
it
as
a
glorious
beginning
there
is
something
impersonal
in
ambition
and
in
the
absorption
of
the
work
to
be
done
the
ambitious
man
forgets
his
merely
individual
sensibilities
to
achieve
though
the
heavens
fall
that
was
henry
ambition
for
mike
and
for
himself
no
one
really
believed
that
the
train
would
have
the
to
start
but
at
last
with
deliberate
intention
evidently
not
to
be
swayed
by
human
pity
the
guard
set
the
estranging
whistle
to
his
lips
cold
and
inexorable
as
nero
turning
down
the
thumb
of
death
and
surely
mike
sad
little
face
began
to
move
away
from
them
hands
reached
out
to
him
eyes
streamed
handkerchiefs
fluttered
but
nothing
could
hold
him
back
and
when
at
last
a
curve
in
the
line
had
swallowed
the
white
speck
of
his
face
they
turned
away
from
the
dark
gulf
where
the
train
had
been
as
though
it
were
a
newly
opened
grave
a
great
to
make
about
a
mere
parting
says
someone
no
doubt
my
dear
sir
all
depends
upon
one
standard
of
value
no
doubt
these
young
people
weighed
life
in
fantastic
scales
their
standard
of
value
was
no
doubt
uncommon
to
love
each
other
was
better
than
rubies
to
lose
each
other
was
bitter
as
death
for
others
other
values
they
had
found
their
only
realities
in
the
human
affections

esther
and
henry
once
more
yes
mike
had
really
gone
henceforth
for
ever
so
long
he
would
only
exist
for
esther
in
letters
or
as
a
sad
little
voice
at
the
end
of
a
wire
it
had
been
arranged
that
henry
should
take
esther
with
him
for
dinner
that
evening
to
the
brightest
restaurant
in
tyre
he
was
a
great
believer
in
being
together
and
also
in
dinner
as
comforters
of
your
sad
heart
perhaps
too
he
was
a
little
glad
to
feel
esther
leaning
gently
upon
him
once
more
their
love
was
too
sure
and
lasting
and
to
have
many
opportunities

being

the

but
it
is
always
there
the
love
of
esther
and
henry
was
like
that
it
has
made
little
show
in
this
history
but
few
readers
can
have
missed
its
presence
in
the
atmosphere
it
might
go
for
weeks
without
its
festival
but
there
it
was
all
the
time
ready
for
any
service
staunch
for
any
trial
it
was
one
of
the
laws
which
kept
the
little
world
i
have
been
describing
slung
safely
in
space
and
securely
shining
it
was
indeed
something
like
a
perfect
relationship
this
love
of
esther
and
henry
had
the
laws
of
nature
permitted
it
it
is
probable
that
mike
and
angel
would
have
been
forced
to
seek
their
mates
elsewhere
as
it
was
though
it
was
thus
less
than
marriage
it
was
more
than
friendship
as
the
holy
intercourse
of
a
mother
and
a
son
is
more
than
friendship
freed
from
the
perturbations
of
sex
it
yet
gained
warmth
and
exhilaration
from
the
unconscious
presence
of
that
stimulating
difference
though
they
were
brother
and
sister
friend
and
friend
henry
and
esther
were
also
man
and
woman
so
satisfying
were
they
to
each
other
that
when
they
sat
thus
together
the
truth
must
be
told
that
for
the
time
at
all
events
they
missed
no
other
man
or
woman
i
have
always
you
said
esther
do
i
still
matter
then
said
henry
are
you
sure
the
old
love
is
not
growing
old
you
know
it
can
never
grow
old
there
is
only
one
mike
but
there
is
only
one
henry
too
it
a
good
love
to
have
harry
is
it
it
makes
one
feel
so
much
safer
in
the
world
dear
little
esther
do
you
remember
those
old
beatings
and
that
night
you
brought
me
the
cake
bless
you
and
henry
reached
his
hand
across
the
table
and
laid
it
so
kindly
on
esther
that
a
hovering
waiter
retreated
out
of
delicacy
mistaking
the
pair
for
lovers
it
was
a
mistake
that
was
often
made
when
they
were
together
and
they
had
sometimes
laughed
when
travelling
at
the
way
passengers
on
the
point
of
entering
their
carriage
had
suddenly
made
up
their
minds
not
to
disturb
the
poor
young
things
and
how
we
used
to
hate
you
once
said
esther
one
can
hardly
understand
it
now
do
you
remember
how
on
sunday
afternoons
you
would
insist
on
playing
at
church
and
how
with
a
tablecloth
for
a
surplice
you
used
to
be
the
minister
how
you
used
to
storm
if
we
poor
things
missed
any
of
the
responses
the
monstrous
egoism
of
it
all
said
henry
laughing
it
was
all
got
up
to
give
me
a
stage
and
nothing
else
i
did
care
whether
you
enjoyed
it
or
not
what
dragons
children
are
of
the
prime
that
tare
each
other
in
their
slime
quoted
esther
yes
we
tore
each
other
and
no
mistake
well
i
made
up
for
it
since
have
i
said
henry
i
hope
i
a
humble
enough
brother
of
the
beautiful
to
please
you
nowadays
you
the
truest
most
reliable
thing
in
the
world
said
esther
i
always
think
of
you
as
something
strong
and
true
to
come
to
except
mike
no
not
even
except
mike
we
call
it
a
draw
dear
little
mike
to
think
of
him
going
further
and
further
away
every
minute
i
wonder
where
he
is
by
now
he
must
have
reached
rugby
long
since
at
that
moment
the
waiter
ventured
to
approach
with
a
silver
tray
a
telegram
it
was
indeed
a
telegram
of
tears
and
distance
from
mike
given
in
at
rugby
even
so
long
parted
and
so
far
away
mike
was
still
true
he
had
not
yet
forgotten
these
young
people
were
great
extravagants
of
the
emotional
telegram
they
were
probably
among
the
earliest
to
apply
electricity
for
messages
some
lovers
feel
it
a
profanation
thus
to
reveal
their
souls
beneath
the
eye
of
a
but
the
objection
of
delicacy
ceases
if
you
can
regard
the
operator
in
his
actual
capacity
as
a
part
of
the
machine
french
perhaps
is
an
advisable
medium
though
if
the
operator
misunderstands
it
your
love
is
apt
to
take
strange
forms
at
its
destination
and
if
he
understands
it
you
may
as
well
use
english
at
once
dear
mike
god
bless
him
and
they
pledged
mike
in
esther
favourite
champagne
the
wives
of
great
must
early
inure
themselves
to
champagne
but
if
you
jealous
of
mike
said
esther
presently
taking
up
the
dropped
thread
of
their
talk
what
about
angel
of
course
it
was
only
nonsense
said
henry
i
know
you
love
angel
far
too
much
to
be
jealous
of
her
as
i
love
mike
and
that
just
the
beautiful
harmony
of
it
all
we
are
just
a
little
impregnable
world
of
four
four
loving
hearts
against
the
world
how
clever
it
was
of
you
to
find
angel
i
found
mike
too
said
henry
laughing
oh
yes
i
know
but
then
i
discovered
you
ah
but
a
still
higher
honour
belongs
to
me
for
i
discovered
you
retorted
henry
when
you
consider
that
i
discovered
three
such
wonderful
persons
as
you
and
angel
and
mike
do
you
think
on
the
whole
that
i
singularly
modest
do
you
love
me
said
esther
presently
quite
irrelevantly
do
you
love
i
asked
first
well
for
the
sake
of
argument
let
us
say
how
much
as
big
as
the
world
oh
well
then
let
have
some
benedictine
with
the
coffee
said
esther
i
thought
of
something
better
more
said
henry
smiling
but
you
could
conscientiously
drink
it
with
me
it
the
red
drink
of
perfect
love
will
you
drink
it
with
me
of
course
i
will
so
the
waiter
brought
a
bottle
bearing
the
beautiful
words
it
like
blood
said
esther
it
makes
me
a
little
frightened
would
you
rather
not
drink
it
asked
henry
you
know
if
you
drink
it
with
me
you
must
drink
it
with
no
one
else
it
is
the
law
of
it
that
we
can
only
drink
it
with
one
not
even
with
mike
not
even
with
mike
what
of
angel
i
will
drink
it
with
no
one
but
you
as
long
as
i
live
i
will
drink
it
then
they
held
up
their
glasses
dear
old
esther
dear
old
henry
and
then
they
laughed
at
their
solemnity
it
was
deeply
sworn
when
esther
reached
home
that
evening
she
found
a
further
telegram
from
mike
announcing
his
arrival
at
euston
and
she
had
scarcely
read
it
when
she
heard
her
father
voice
calling
her
she
went
immediately
to
the
esther
dear
he
said
your
mother
and
i
want
a
word
with
you
no
james
you
must
speak
for
yourself
in
this
said
mesurier
evidently
a
little
perturbed
well
dear
if
i
must
be
alone
in
the
matter
i
must
bear
it
i
can
not
shrink
from
my
duty
on
that
account
then
turning
to
esther
i
called
you
in
to
speak
to
you
about
mike
laflin
yes
father
exclaimed
esther
with
a
little
gasp
of
surprise
i
met
laflin
on
the
boat
this
morning
and
was
much
astonished
and
grieved
to
hear
of
the
rash
step
his
son
has
chosen
to
take
the
matter
has
evidently
been
kept
from
me
strictly
speaking
it
had
i
understand
though
on
that
again
i
have
not
been
consulted
that
you
and
mike
have
for
some
time
been
informally
engaged
to
each
other
now
you
know
my
views
on
the
theatre
and
i
am
sure
that
you
must
see
that
mike
having
taken
such
a
step
must
at
once
put
an
end
to
any
such
idea
your
own
sense
of
propriety
would
i
am
sure
tell
you
that
without
any
words
from
me
father
cried
esther
in
astonishment
you
know
that
i
considered
mike
a
very
nice
lad
his
family
is
respectable
and
he
would
have
come
into
a
very
comfortable
business
if
he
had
taken
this
foolish
freak
into
his
head
but
father
you
have
laughed
at
his
recitations
yourself
many
a
time
here
of
an
evening
what
difference
can
there
be
there
is
the
difference
of
the
theatre
the
contaminating
atmosphere
the
people
it
attracts
the
harm
it
does
your
father
as
you
know
has
never
been
within
a
theatre
in
his
life
is
it
likely
that
he
can
look
with
calmness
upon
his
daughter
marrying
a
man
whose
livelihood
is
to
be
gained
in
a
scandalous
and
debasing
profession
father
i
can
not
listen
to
your
talking
of
mike
like
that
if
it
is
wrong
to
make
people
innocently
happy
to
make
them
laugh
and
forget
their
troubles
to
to
well
if
it
wrong
to
be
mike
i
sorry
but
wrong
or
right
i
love
him
and
nothing
will
ever
make
me
give
him
up
mesurier
here
interrupted
i
told
you
james
how
it
would
be
you
can
not
change
young
hearts
the
times
are
not
the
same
as
when
you
and
i
were
young
and
though
i
sure
i
do
want
to
go
against
you
i
think
you
are
too
hard
on
esther
love
is
love
after
all
and
mike
one
of
the
lads
that
ever
walked
thank
you
mother
said
esther
impulsively
throwing
her
arms
round
her
mother
neck
and
bursting
into
tears
i
i
will
never
give
give
him
up
no
dear
no
now
do
distress
yourself
it
will
all
come
right
your
father
does
quite
understand
and
then
a
great
tempest
of
sobbing
came
over
esther
and
swept
her
away
to
her
own
room
the
father
and
mother
turned
to
each
other
with
some
anger
james
i
surprised
at
your
distressing
the
poor
child
like
that
you
might
have
known
she
would
be
sensitive
with
mike
only
gone
you
could
surely
have
waited
till
i
am
surprised
mary
that
you
can
encourage
her
as
you
did
you
can
not
surely
uphold
the
theatre
well
james
i
do
know
there
are
theatres
and
theatres
and
actors
and
actors
and
there
have
been
some
very
good
men
actors
after
all
and
some
very
bad
men
ministers
if
it
comes
to
that
she
added
and
theatre
or
no
theatre
love
love
in
spite
of
all
the
fathers
and
mothers
in
the
world
all
right
mary
i
would
prefer
then
that
we
spoke
no
more
on
the
matter
for
this
evening
and
james
mesurier
turned
to
his
diary
to
record
along
with
the
state
of
the
weather
and
the
engagements
of
the
day
the
undutiful
conduct
of
esther
and
a
painful
difference
with
his
wife
strange
that
men
who
have
themselves
loved
and
begotten
should
thus
for
a
moment
imagine
that
a
small
social
prejudice
or
a
narrow
religious
formula
can
break
the
purpose
of
a
young
and
vigorous
passion
do
they
realise
what
it
is
they
are
proposing
to
obstruct
this
is
love
my
dear
sir
at
once
the
mightiest
might
and
the
rightest
right
in
the
universe
this
is
niagara
the
atlantic
the
power
of
the
stars
and
the
strength
of
the
tides
it
is
all
the
winds
of
the
world
and
all
the
fires
of
the
centre
you
surely
can
not
be
serious
in
asking
it
to
take
in
exchange
some
obsolete
objection
against
its
beloved
chapter
xxxix
mike
afar
this
collision
with
her
father
braced
up
esther
nerves
and
made
mike
absence
easier
to
bear
her
father
made
no
more
allusion
to
it
he
was
entering
that
period
when
fathers
however
despotic
content
themselves
with
protest
where
once
they
have
governed
by
royal
proclamation
he
was
losing
heart
to
contend
with
his
children
they
must
go
their
own
ways
though
it
must
not
be
without
occasional
severe
and
solemn
warnings
on
his
part
mike
and
esther
wrote
to
each
other
twice
a
week
they
had
talked
of
every
day
but
a
wise
instinct
prompted
them
to
the
less
romantic
but
likely
the
more
enduring
arrangement
it
would
be
none
the
less
open
to
them
to
write
fourteen
letters
a
week
if
they
wished
but
to
have
had
to
admit
that
one
letter
a
day
was
a
serious
tax
not
only
on
one
other
occupations
including
idleness
but
also
on
the
amount
of
available
would
have
been
a
dangerous
correction
of
an
impulsive
miscalculation
london
lodgings
are
not
great
cheerers
of
the
human
spirit
and
mike
was
very
lonely
in
his
first
letter
or
two
but
as
the
rehearsals
proceeded
it
was
evident
that
he
was
taking
hold
of
his
new
world
and
the
letter
which
told
of
his
first
night
and
of
his
own
encouraging
success
in
it
was
buoyant
with
the
rising
tide
of
the
future
his
chief
had
affectionately
laid
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
as
he
came
off
from
his
scene
and
in
the
hearing
of
the
whole
company
prophesied
a
great
future
for
him
mike
had
been
born
under
a
lucky
star
and
he
had
hardly
been
in
london
two
months
when
accident
very
perceptibly
brightened
it
the
chief
comedian
in
the
company
fell
ill
and
though
mike
had
had
so
little
experience
his
chief
had
so
much
confidence
in
his
native
gift
that
he
cast
him
for
the
vacant
part
mike
more
than
justified
the
confidence
and
not
only
pleased
him
but
succeeded
in
individualising
himself
with
the
audience
he
had
only
played
it
for
a
week
when
one
saturday
evening
the
audience
after
calling
the
manager
himself
three
times
set
up
a
cry
for
laflin
the
obsequious
attendant
pretended
to
consider
it
as
a
fourth
call
for
the
manager
and
made
as
if
to
move
the
curtain
aside
for
him
once
more
but
with
a
magnanimity
rare
indeed
in
a
star
of
his
magnitude
no
no
he
said
it
is
laflin
they
want
quick
lad
and
take
your
first
call
so
little
mike
stepped
before
the
curtain
and
made
his
first
bow
to
an
affectionate
burst
of
applause
what
happy
tears
would
have
glittered
in
esther
eyes
had
she
been
there
to
see
it
and
in
henry
too
and
particularly
perhaps
in
excitable
angel
even
so
soon
was
the
blossom
giving
promise
of
the
fruit
chapter
xl
a
legacy
more
precious
than
gold
meanwhile
henry
plodded
away
at
aunt
tipping
working
sometimes
on
a
volume
of
essays
for
the
london
publisher
and
sometimes
on
his
novel
now
and
again
writing
a
review
and
earning
an
odd
guinea
for
a
poem
and
now
and
again
indulging
in
a
day
of
richly
doing
nothing
otherwise
one
day
was
like
another
with
the
many
exceptions
of
the
days
on
which
he
saw
angel
or
esther
with
ned
he
spent
many
of
his
evenings
and
he
soon
formed
the
pleasant
habit
of
dropping
in
on
gerard
last
thing
before
for
a
smoke
and
half
an
hour
chat
there
is
always
a
good
deal
of
youth
left
in
any
one
who
genuinely
loves
youth
and
gerard
always
spoke
of
his
youth
as
adam
in
his
declining
years
might
have
spoken
of
paradise
for
him
life
was
just
youth
and
the
rest
of
it
death
after
thirty
he
would
say
the
happiest
life
is
only
history
repeating
itself
i
am
no
cynic
far
from
it
but
the
worst
of
life
is
the
monotony
of
the
bill
of
fare
to
do
a
thing
once
even
twice
is
delightful
perhaps
even
a
third
time
is
successfully
possible
but
to
do
it
four
times
is
middle
age
if
you
think
of
it
what
is
there
to
do
after
thirty
that
one
ought
not
to
have
achieved
to
perfection
before
you
know
the
literary
dictum
that
the
poet
who
has
written
a
masterpiece
before
he
is
thirty
will
never
write
any
after
of
course
there
are
exceptions
i
am
speaking
of
the
rule
in
business
for
example
what
future
is
there
for
the
man
who
has
not
already
a
dashing
past
at
thirty
of
course
the
bulk
the
massive
trunk
and
the
impressive
foliage
of
his
business
must
come
afterwards
but
the
tree
must
have
been
firmly
rooted
and
stoutly
branched
before
then
and
able
to
go
on
growing
on
its
own
account
the
work
in
fact
must
have
been
done
take
perhaps
the
only
thing
really
worth
doing
in
life
and
gerard
perceptibly
saddened
that
is
marrying
a
woman
you
love
or
i
should
say
woman
for
you
only
really
one
woman
enough
to
think
that
well
i
say
marrying
the
woman
you
love
and
bringing
into
the
world
that
miracle
of
miracles
a
child
that
shall
be
something
of
you
and
all
her
that
certainly
is
something
to
have
done
before
thirty
and
not
to
be
repeated
perhaps
more
than
once
before
or
after
she
will
want
a
boy
like
you
and
you
will
have
a
girl
like
her
that
you
may
easily
accomplish
before
thirty
afterwards
however
if
you
go
on
repeating
each
other
what
do
you
do
but
blur
the
individuality
of
the
original
masterpieces
though
pursued
gerard
laughing
always
ready
to
forget
his
original
argument
in
the
seductiveness
of
an
unexpected
development
of
it
though
after
all
i
admit
there
might
be
a
temptation
sometimes
to
improve
upon
the
originals
my
dear
we
might
say
not
quite
satisfied
yet
with
the
shade
of
eva
hair
it
nearly
yours
but
not
quite
it
an
improvement
on
anna
whose
eyes
now
are
exactly
yours
eva
unfortunately
are
not
so
faithful
i
afraid
we
have
to
try
again
no
but
seriously
he
once
more
began
for
a
really
vital
and
successful
life
there
is
no
adequate
employment
of
the
faculties
after
thirty
except
of
course
in
the
repetition
of
former
successes
no
i
even
withdraw
that
not
the
repetition
only
the
conservation
the
feeding
of
former
successes
the
success
is
in
the
creation
when
a
world
is
once
created
any
fool
can
keep
it
spinning
man
life
is
at
least
thirty
years
too
long
two
score
years
is
more
than
enough
for
us
to
say
what
we
were
sent
here
to
say
and
if
consider
those
biographies
in
which
you
are
most
interested
the
biographies
of
great
writers
you
can
not
but
bear
me
out
what
for
instance
did
keats
and
shelley
and
burns
and
byron
lose
by
dying
all
of
them
long
before
they
were
forty
keats
even
long
before
he
was
thirty
and
what
did
wordsworth
and
coleridge
gain
by
living
so
long
after
wordsworth
and
coleridge
did
even
live
to
repeat
themselves
else
of
course
one
would
have
begged
them
to
go
on
living
for
ever
for
some
repetitions
it
is
admitted
are
welcome
for
instance
you
have
a
little
more
whisky
henry
always
agreed
so
completely
with
gerard
talk
or
at
least
so
delighted
in
it
that
he
had
little
scope
of
opportunity
to
say
much
himself
and
gerard
was
too
keen
a
talker
to
complain
of
a
rapt
young
listener
how
old
are
you
he
said
presently
next
month
how
wonderful
to
be
yet
i
do
suppose
realised
it
in
the
least
in
your
own
view
you
an
aged
philosopher
white
with
a
past
and
bowed
down
with
the
cares
of
a
future
just
you
stay
in
bed
all
day
and
ponder
on
the
wonderfulness
of
being
i
you
beginning
i
done
with
and
yet
in
some
ways
i
believe
i
younger
than
you
though
perhaps
alas
what
i
consider
the
youth
in
me
is
only
the
wish
to
be
young
again
the
will
to
do
and
enjoy
without
the
force
and
the
appetite
but
by
the
way
when
i
say
i
i
mean
that
i
in
the
course
of
next
week
next
thursday
in
fact
and
if
you
do
me
that
kindness
i
should
be
grateful
if
you
would
join
me
that
evening
in
celebrating
the
melancholy
occasion
i
got
a
great
mind
to
enlist
your
sympathy
in
a
little
ancient
history
if
it
wo
be
too
great
a
tax
upon
your
goodness
but
i
think
it
over
between
now
and
then
gerard
birthday
had
come
and
the
ancient
history
he
had
spoken
of
had
proved
to
be
a
chapter
of
his
own
history
the
beauty
and
sadness
of
which
had
made
an
impression
upon
henry
to
be
rendered
ineffaceable
a
very
few
days
after
in
a
sudden
and
terrible
manner
one
early
morning
about
four
just
as
it
was
growing
light
he
had
suddenly
awakened
with
a
strong
feeling
that
some
one
was
bending
over
him
he
opened
his
eyes
to
see
as
he
thought
gerard
hastily
leaving
his
bedside
gerard
he
cried
what
the
matter
but
the
figure
gave
no
answer
faded
away
down
the
long
room
and
disappeared
henry
sat
up
in
bed
and
struck
a
light
his
heart
beating
violently
but
there
was
no
one
there
and
the
door
was
closed
it
had
evidently
been
one
of
those
dreams
that
persist
on
the
eye
for
a
moment
after
waking
yet
it
left
him
uneasy
and
presently
he
wondered
if
gerard
could
be
ill
he
determined
to
see
so
slipping
on
his
he
crossed
the
landing
to
room
and
softly
knocking
opened
the
door
and
put
in
his
head
gerard
old
chap
are
you
all
right
gerard
there
was
no
answer
and
the
room
seemed
unaccountably
still
he
listened
for
the
sound
of
breathing
but
he
could
hear
it
gerard
he
cried
again
louder
but
there
was
still
no
answer
and
then
with
the
silence
a
chill
terror
began
to
creep
through
his
blood
he
had
never
yet
seen
death
and
perhaps
if
he
had
the
terror
in
his
thought
would
not
have
been
lessened
with
a
heart
that
had
almost
stopped
beating
and
knees
that
shook
beneath
him
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
walked
over
to
the
bed
it
was
still
too
dark
to
see
more
than
outlines
and
masses
of
white
and
black
but
even
so
he
could
see
that
the
stillness
with
which
gerard
was
lying
was
the
stillness
of
death
his
next
thought
was
to
rouse
aunt
tipping
and
together
the
two
bent
over
the
dead
face
yes
he
gone
said
aunt
tipping
poor
gentlemen
how
beautiful
he
looks
and
they
both
gazed
in
silence
upon
the
calm
smiling
face
well
he
better
off
she
said
presently
leaning
over
him
and
softly
pressing
down
the
lids
of
his
eyes
henry
involuntarily
drew
away
dear
lad
there
nothing
to
be
frightened
of
said
his
aunt
as
harmless
as
a
baby
then
she
took
a
handkerchief
from
a
drawer
and
spread
it
gently
over
the
dead
man
face
to
aunt
tipping
the
dead
were
indeed
as
little
children
and
inspired
her
with
a
strange
motherly
tenderness
many
had
been
the
tired
silent
ones
whose
eyes
she
had
closed
and
whose
limbs
she
had
washed
against
their
last
resting
place
they
were
so
helpless
now
they
could
do
nothing
any
more
for
themselves
later
in
the
day
henry
came
again
and
sat
long
by
the
dead
man
side
it
seemed
uncompanionable
to
have
grown
thus
suddenly
afraid
of
him
to
leave
him
thus
alone
in
that
still
room
and
as
he
sat
and
watched
him
he
gave
to
his
memory
a
solemn
service
of
faithful
thought
thus
it
was
he
went
over
again
the
words
in
which
gerard
had
made
him
the
depository
the
legatee
of
his
most
sacred
possession
gerard
had
evidently
had
some
presentiment
of
his
approaching
end
i
am
going
he
had
said
to
place
the
greatest
confidence
in
you
one
man
can
place
in
another
pay
you
the
greatest
compliment
i
shall
die
some
day
and
something
tells
me
that
that
divine
event
is
not
very
far
off
now
i
have
no
one
in
the
world
who
cares
an
old
pen
for
me
and
a
new
one
is
perhaps
about
as
much
as
i
care
for
any
one
with
one
exception
and
that
is
a
woman
whom
i
shall
never
see
again
she
is
not
dead
but
has
been
worse
than
dead
for
me
these
ten
years
i
am
optimist
enough
to
believe
that
her
old
love
for
me
still
survives
making
sweet
the
secret
places
of
her
soul
never
once
in
all
these
years
to
have
doubted
her
love
has
been
more
than
most
marriages
but
were
i
to
live
for
another
ten
years
and
still
another
i
would
believe
in
it
still
but
the
stars
were
against
us
we
met
too
late
we
met
when
she
had
long
been
engaged
to
a
friend
of
her
youth
a
man
noble
and
true
to
whom
she
owed
much
and
whom
she
felt
it
a
kind
of
murder
to
desert
it
was
one
of
those
fallacious
chivalries
of
feeling
which
are
the
danger
of
sensitive
and
imaginative
minds
religion
strengthened
it
as
it
is
so
apt
to
strengthen
any
form
of
short
of
technical
suicide
there
was
but
a
month
to
their
marriage
when
we
met
for
us
it
was
a
month
of
rapture
and
agonies
of
heaven
shot
through
with
hell
i
saw
further
than
she
i
begged
her
at
least
to
wait
a
year
but
the
force
of
my
appeal
was
weakened
by
scruples
similar
to
her
own
to
rob
another
of
his
happiness
is
an
act
from
which
we
may
well
shrink
though
we
can
clearly
see
that
the
happiness
was
really
destined
for
us
and
can
never
be
his
in
any
like
degree
during
this
time
i
had
received
from
her
many
letters
letters
such
as
a
woman
only
writes
in
the
of
her
passion
and
one
day
i
received
the
last
there
was
in
it
one
sentence
which
when
i
read
it
i
think
my
heart
broke
you
believe
it
ran
a
love
that
can
lie
asleep
as
in
a
trance
in
this
world
to
awaken
again
in
another
a
love
that
during
centuries
of
silence
can
still
be
true
and
be
love
still
in
a
thousand
years
if
you
do
go
on
loving
me
for
that
is
the
only
love
i
dare
give
you
i
must
love
you
no
more
in
this
world
each
morning
as
i
have
risen
and
each
night
as
i
have
turned
to
sleep
those
words
have
repeated
themselves
again
and
again
in
my
heart
for
ten
years
it
was
so
i
became
the
ashton
gerard
you
know
since
that
day
we
have
never
met
or
written
to
each
other
all
i
know
is
that
she
is
still
alive
and
still
with
him
and
never
would
i
disturb
their
peace
when
i
die
i
would
not
have
her
know
it
if
love
immortal
we
shall
meet
again
when
i
am
worthier
to
meet
her
such
reunions
are
either
mere
dreams
or
they
are
realities
to
which
the
strongest
forces
of
the
universe
are
pledged
henry
only
comment
had
been
to
grip
gerard
hand
and
give
him
the
sympathy
of
silence
now
said
gerard
once
more
after
a
while
it
is
about
those
letters
i
want
to
speak
to
you
they
are
here
and
he
unlocked
a
drawer
and
drew
from
it
a
little
silver
box
i
always
keep
them
here
the
key
of
the
drawer
is
on
this
ring
and
this
little
gold
key
is
the
key
of
the
box
itself
i
tell
you
this
because
i
have
what
you
may
regard
as
a
strange
request
to
make
i
suppose
most
men
would
consider
it
their
duty
either
to
burn
these
letters
or
leave
instructions
for
them
to
be
buried
with
them
that
is
a
gruesome
form
of
sentiment
in
which
i
have
too
much
imagination
to
indulge
both
my
ideas
of
duty
and
sentiment
take
a
different
form
the
surname
of
the
writer
of
these
letters
is
nowhere
revealed
in
them
nor
are
there
any
references
in
them
by
which
she
could
ever
be
identified
therefore
the
menace
to
her
fair
fame
in
their
preservation
is
not
a
question
involved
now
when
the
simplest
woman
is
in
love
she
writes
wonderfully
but
when
a
woman
of
imagination
and
intellect
is
caught
by
the
fire
of
passion
she
becomes
a
poet
once
in
her
life
every
such
woman
is
an
artist
once
for
some
one
man
unworthy
sake
she
becomes
inspired
and
out
of
the
fulness
of
her
heart
writes
him
letters
warm
and
real
as
the
of
sappho
such
are
the
letters
in
this
little
box
they
are
the
classic
of
a
month
passion
written
as
no
man
has
ever
yet
been
able
to
write
his
love
do
you
think
it
strange
then
that
i
should
shrink
from
destroying
them
i
would
as
soon
burn
the
songs
of
shelley
they
are
living
things
shall
i
selfishly
bury
the
beating
heart
of
them
in
the
silence
of
the
grave
so
mesurier
he
continued
affectionately
when
i
met
you
and
understood
something
of
your
nature
i
thought
that
in
you
i
had
found
one
who
was
worthy
to
guard
this
treasure
for
me
and
perhaps
pass
it
on
again
to
some
other
chosen
spirit
so
that
these
beautiful
words
of
a
noble
woman
heart
shall
not
die
for
when
a
man
loves
a
woman
mesurier
as
you
yourself
must
know
he
is
insatiable
to
hear
her
praise
and
it
is
agony
for
him
to
think
that
her
memory
may
suffer
extinction
therefore
mesurier
henry
let
me
call
you
i
want
to
give
the
memory
of
my
love
into
your
hands
i
want
you
to
love
it
for
me
when
perhaps
i
can
love
it
no
more
i
want
you
sometimes
to
open
this
box
and
read
in
these
letters
as
if
they
were
your
own
i
want
you
sometimes
to
speak
softly
the
name
of
when
my
lips
can
speak
it
no
more
such
was
the
beautiful
legacy
of
which
henry
found
himself
the
possessor
by
gerard
death
early
on
that
day
he
had
remembered
his
promise
to
his
dead
friend
and
had
found
the
silver
box
and
locked
it
away
among
his
own
most
sacred
things
some
day
in
an
hour
and
place
upon
which
none
might
break
he
would
open
the
little
box
and
read
helen
letters
as
gerard
had
wished
already
one
sentence
was
fixed
unforgettably
upon
his
mind
and
he
said
it
over
softly
to
himself
as
he
sat
by
silent
bed
do
you
believe
in
a
love
that
can
lie
asleep
as
in
a
trance
in
this
world
to
awaken
again
in
another
a
love
that
during
centuries
of
silence
can
still
be
true
and
be
love
still
in
a
thousand
years
if
you
do
go
on
loving
me
for
that
is
the
only
love
i
dare
give
you
i
must
love
you
no
more
in
this
world
strange
dreams
of
the
indomitable
dust
already
another
man
love
was
growing
dear
to
him
already
his
soul
said
the
name
of
helen
softly
for
gerard
sake
chapter
xli
laborious
days
with
gerard
death
henry
began
to
find
aunt
tipping
too
sad
a
place
to
go
on
living
in
it
had
become
haunted
and
when
new
people
moved
into
gerard
rooms
it
became
still
more
painful
for
him
it
was
as
though
gerard
had
been
dispossessed
and
driven
out
so
he
cast
about
for
some
new
shelter
and
one
day
chance
having
taken
him
to
the
shipping
end
of
the
city
he
came
upon
some
old
offices
which
seemed
full
of
anxiety
to
be
let
inquiring
of
a
chatty
little
housekeeper
wife
he
discovered
away
at
the
echoing
top
of
the
building
a
big
room
for
which
she
thought
the
owner
would
be
glad
to
take
ten
pounds
a
year
that
whole
storey
was
deserted
henry
made
up
his
mind
at
once
and
broke
the
news
to
aunt
tipping
that
evening
it
was
the
withering
of
one
of
her
few
rays
of
poetry
and
she
struggled
to
keep
him
but
when
she
saw
how
it
was
the
good
woman
insisted
that
he
should
take
something
from
her
towards
furnishing
receiving
was
nothing
like
so
blessed
as
giving
for
aunt
tipping
that
old
desk
yes
she
had
bought
it
for
him
that
he
must
certainly
take
and
think
of
his
old
aunt
sometimes
as
he
wrote
his
great
books
on
it
and
some
she
could
well
afford
she
would
take
no
denial
angel
and
esther
were
then
called
in
to
help
him
in
the
purchase
of
a
carpet
a
an
old
sofa
and
a
few
chairs
a
carpenter
got
to
work
on
the
bookshelves
and
in
a
fortnight
time
still
another
habitation
had
been
built
for
the
muse
a
habitation
from
which
she
was
not
destined
to
remove
again
till
she
and
angel
and
henry
all
moved
into
one
house
together
a
removal
which
was
as
yet
too
far
off
to
be
included
in
this
history
ten
pounds
a
year
a
and
a
teapot
this
was
henry
new
formula
for
the
cultivation
of
literature
he
had
so
far
progressed
in
his
ambitions
as
to
have
arrived
at
the
dignity
of
a
garret
of
his
own
and
he
liked
to
pretend
that
soon
he
might
be
romantically
fortunate
enough
to
sit
face
to
face
with
starvation
he
knew
however
that
it
would
be
a
starvation
mitigated
by
supplies
from
three
separate
homes
a
lad
with
a
sweetheart
and
a
sister
a
mother
and
an
aunt
all
in
love
with
him
is
not
likely
to
become
an
authority
on
starvation
in
its
severest
forms
a
stern
law
had
been
passed
that
henry
daytime
hours
were
to
be
as
strictly
respected
as
those
of
a
man
of
business
yet
quite
often
about
eleven
in
the
morning
there
would
come
a
heavenly
whisper
along
the
passage
and
a
little
knock
on
the
door
soft
as
a
flower
tapping
against
a
thank
goodness
that
angel
angel
bless
you
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
i
ca
get
on
a
bit
with
my
work
this
morning
oh

have
come
to
interrupt

minutes

i
thought

her

get
what
i
want
i
be
back
in
a
minute
well
then
just
one
now
that
enough
and
off
she
would
skip
if
you
want
to
know
how
fairies
look
when
they
are
making
you
should
have
seen
angel
absorbed
little
shining
face
now
do
be
quiet
henry
i
busy
why
do
you
get
on
with
your
work

wo

word

certain

one
of
my
bad
days

henry
that
lazy
you
must
give
way
like
that
you
make
me
wish
i
had
come
it
all
my
fault
no
really
dear
it
is
i
have
done
a
stroke
all
morning
though
i
sat
with
my
pen
for
two
hours
you
might
stay
angel
just
an
hour
or
two
no
henry
mother

and
besides
i
must
no

will
be
all
the
same
if
you
go
i
know
i
shall
do
nothing
look
at
my
morning
work
and
he
brought
her
a
sheet
of
paper
containing
two
lines
and
a
half
of
prose
one
line
and
a
half
of
which
was
plentifully
scratched
out
to
this
argument
he
added
two
or
three
persuasive
embraces
it
really
true
henry
well
of
course
i
ought
but
if
you
work
of
course
you
ca
and
you
must
have
a
little
rest
sometimes
i
know
well
then
i
stay
but
only
till
we
finished
lunch
you
know
and
we
must
have
it
early
i
wo
stay
a
minute
past
two
do
you
hear
and
now
i
run
along
with
this
to
mrs
glass
when
angel
had
gone
promptly
at
three
as
likely
as
not
another
step
would
be
heard
coming
down
the
passage
and
a
feminine
rustle
suggesting
a
fuller
foliage
of
skirts
pause
outside
the
door
then
a
sort
of
knock
esther
why
you
just
missed
angel
what
a
pity
well
dear
i
only
ran
up
for
i
was
shopping
in
town
and
i
could
resist
looking
in
to
see
how
the
poor
boy
was
getting
on
no
dear
i
wo
take
my
things
off
i
must
catch
the
three
boat
and
then
i
keep
you
from
your
work
esther
always
said
this
with
a
sort
of
suggestion
in
her
voice
that
it
was
just
possible
henry
might
have
found
some
new
way
of
both
keeping
her
there
and
doing
his
work
at
the
same
time
as
though
she
had
said
i
know
you
can
not
possibly
work
while
i
am
here
but
of
course
if
you
can
and
talking
to
me
all
the
time
wo
interfere
with
it
well
i
stay
oh
no
you
wo
really
to
tell
the
truth
i
done
none
i
ca
get
into
the
mood
so
you
been
getting
angel
to
help
you
oh
well
of
course
if
angel
can
be
allowed
to
interrupt
you
i
suppose
i
can
too
well
then
stay
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
you
may
as
well
take
your
things
off
and
i
make
a
cup
of
tea
eh
that
be
cosey
wo
it
and
then
you
can
read
me
mike
last
letter
eh
oh
he
doing
splendidly
dear
i
had
a
lovely
letter
from
him
this
morning
would
you
really
care
to
hear
a
bit
of
it
and
esther
would
proceed
to
read
picking
her
way
among
the
endearments
and
the
diminutives
i
glad
dear
why
if
he
goes
on
at
this
rate
you
be
able
to
get
married
in
no
time
yes
is
it
splendid
dear
i
am
so
happy
what
i
give
to
see
his
little
face
for
five
minutes
would
you
rather
perhaps
he
be
able
to
run
up
on
bank
holiday
i
afraid
not
dear
he
speaks
of
it
in
his
letter
and
just
hopes
for
it
but
rather
fears
they
have
to
play
at
brighton
or
some
other
stupid
seaside
place
that
a
bother
yes
dear
old
mike
to
think
of
him
working
away
there
all
by
himself
god
bless
him
do
you
know
he
never
seen
this
old
room
it
struck
me
yesterday
it
does
seem
quite
warmed
till
seen
it
would
it
be
lovely
to
have
him
here
some
night
one
of
our
old
long
evenings
well
i
suppose
it
will
really
come
one
of
these
days
and
then
we
shall
be
having
you
married
and
going
off
to
london
in
clouds
of
glory
while
poor
old
henry
grubs
away
down
here
in
tyre
well
if
we
do
go
first
you
will
not
be
long
after
us
dear
and
if
only
mike
could
make
a
really
great
hit
why
in
five
years
time
we
might
all
be
quite
rich
wo
it
be
wonderful
then
the
kettle
boiled
and
henry
made
the
tea
and
when
it
had
long
since
been
drunk
esther
began
to
think
it
must
be
five
and
horrified
to
find
it
a
quarter
to
six
confessed
to
being
ashamed
of
herself
and
tried
to
console
her
conscience
by
the
haste
of
her
i
afraid
i
wasted
your
afternoon
she
said
but
we
do
often
get
a
chat
nowadays
do
we
dear
go
on
loving
me
wo
you
after
that
henry
would
give
the
day
up
as
a
bad
job
and
begin
to
wonder
if
ned
would
be
dropping
in
that
evening
for
a
smoke
and
as
that
was
ned
almost
nightly
custom
about
eight
the
chances
of
henry
disappointment
were
not
serious
chapter
xlii
a
heavier
footfall
one
morning
as
henry
was
really
doing
a
little
work
a
more
ponderous
step
broke
the
silence
of
his
landing
a
heavy
footfall
full
of
friendship
certainly
that
was
not
angel
nor
even
the
more
weighty
esther
though
when
the
knock
came
it
was
little
and
shy
as
a
woman
henry
threw
open
the
door
but
for
a
moment
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
and
then
recalling
the
idiosyncrasy
of
a
certain
new
friend
whom
by
that
very
token
he
guessed
it
might
be
he
came
out
on
to
the
landing
to
find
a
great
big
friendly
man
in
corpulent
blue
serge
a
rough
dark
beard
and
a
slouched
hat
standing
a
few
feet
off
in
a
deprecating
way
which
really
meant
that
if
there
were
any
ladies
in
the
room
with
mesurier
he
would
prefer
to
call
another
time
for
though
he
had
two
or
three
grownup
daughters
of
his
own
this
giant
of
a
man
was
as
shy
of
a
bit
of
a
thing
like
angel
whom
he
had
met
there
one
day
as
though
he
were
a
mere
boy
he
always
felt
he
once
said
in
explanation
as
though
he
might
break
them
in
shaking
hands
they
affected
him
like
the
presence
of
delicate
china
and
yet
he
could
hold
a
baby
deftly
as
an
elephant
can
nip
up
a
flower
and
to
see
him
turn
over
the
pages
of
a
delicate
de
was
a
lesson
in
tenderness
for
this
big
man
who
as
he
would
himself
say
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
pirate
was
as
insatiable
of
fine
editions
as
a
of
chocolate
creams
he
was
one
of
those
dearest
of
god
creatures
a
gentle
giant
and
his
voice
when
it
was
necessary
to
be
angry
was
as
low
and
kind
as
an
old
nurse
at
the
cradle
side
henry
had
come
to
know
him
through
his
little
scotch
printer
who
printed
circulars
and
for
the
business
over
which
fairfax
for
that
was
his
name
presided
by
day
he
was
the
vigorous
brain
of
a
huge
emporium
a
sort
of
tyrian
whiteley
but
day
and
night
he
was
a
lover
of
books
and
you
could
never
catch
him
so
busy
but
that
he
could
spare
the
time
mysteriously
to
beckon
you
into
his
private
office
and
with
the
glee
of
a
child
show
you
his
last
large
paper
he
not
only
loved
books
but
he
was
rumoured
liberally
to
have
assisted
one
or
two
distressed
men
of
genius
to
the
world
the
tales
of
the
surreptitious
goodness
of
his
heart
were
many
but
it
was
known
too
that
the
big
kind
man
had
a
terribly
searching
eye
under
his
briery
brows
and
could
be
as
stern
towards
ingratitude
as
he
was
soft
to
misfortune
henry
once
caught
a
glimpse
of
this
as
they
spoke
of
a
mutual
friend
whom
he
had
helped
to
no
purpose
fairfax
never
used
many
words
on
this
occasion
he
was
grimly
laconic
he
said
shaking
his
head
it
was
his
way
of
saying
that
that
was
the
only
cure
for
that
particular
kind
of
man
it
was
evident
that
his
generous
eye
had
seen
how
things
were
with
henry
he
had
subscribed
for
at
least
a
dozen
copies
of
the
book
of
angelica
and
in
several
ways
shown
his
interest
in
the
struggling
young
poet
as
has
been
said
he
had
seen
angelica
one
day
and
his
shyness
had
not
prevented
his
heart
from
going
out
to
these
two
young
people
and
the
dream
he
saw
in
their
eyes
he
had
determined
to
do
what
he
could
to
help
them
and
he
had
come
with
a
plan
i
hope
you
not
too
proud
to
give
me
a
hand
mesurier
in
a
little
idea
i
got
he
said
i
think
you
know
how
proud
i
am
and
how
proud
i
not
fairfax
said
henry
i
sure
anything
i
could
do
for
you
would
make
me
proud
if
that
what
you
mean
thank
you
thank
you
but
you
must
speak
too
fast
advertising
does
the
word
frighten
you
no
well
it
a
scheme
thought
of
for
a
little
really
artistic
and
humorous
advertising
combined
i
got
a
promise
from
one
of
the
most
original
artists
of
the
day
you
know
his
name
to
do
the
pictures
and
i
want
you
to
do
the
verses
at
i
may
say
your
own
price
it
not
perhaps
the
highest
occupation
for
a
poet
but
it
something
to
be
going
on
with
and
if
we
got
good
posters
as
advertisements
i
do
see
why
we
have
good
humorous
verse
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
think
it
capital
said
henry
who
was
almost
too
ready
to
turn
his
hand
to
anything
of
course
i
do
it
only
too
glad
well
that
settled
now
name
your
price
do
be
frightened
really
i
ca
i
have
the
least
idea
what
i
should
get
wait
till
i
have
done
a
few
of
the
verses
and
you
can
give
me
what
you
please
no
sir
said
fairfax
business
is
business
if
you
wo
name
a
figure
i
must
will
you
consider
a
hundred
pounds
sufficient
a
hundred
pounds
henry
gasped
out
the
tears
almost
starting
to
his
eyes
fairfax
did
not
miss
his
frank
joy
and
liked
him
for
his
ingenuousness
all
right
then
we
call
it
settled
i
shall
be
ready
for
the
verses
as
soon
as
you
care
to
write
them
fairfax
i
will
tell
you
frankly
that
this
is
a
great
deal
to
me
and
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
not
a
word
not
a
word
my
boy
we
want
your
verses
we
want
your
verses
that
right
is
it
good
verses
good
money
now
no
more
of
that
and
the
good
man
in
alarm
lest
he
should
be
thanked
further
made
an
abrupt
and
awkward
farewell
it
will
keep
the
lad
going
a
few
months
anyhow
he
said
to
himself
as
he
tramped
downstairs
glad
that
he
been
able
to
think
of
something
for
while
the
scheme
was
admirable
as
an
advertisement
and
would
more
than
repay
owens
outlay
its
origin
had
been
pure
philanthropy
such
good
angels
do
walk
this
world
in
the
guise
of
bulky
quite
one
hundred
pounds
said
henry
over
and
over
again
to
himself
one
hundred
pounds
what
news
for
angel
he
had
soon
a
scheme
in
his
head
for
the
book
which
entirely
hit
fairfax
fancy
it
was
to
make
a
volume
of
verse
celebrating
each
of
the
various
departments
of
the
great
store
in
metres
parodying
the
styles
of
the
old
english
ballads
and
various
poets
ancient
and
modern
and
was
to
be
called
bon
marché
ballads
something
like
this
for
example
said
henry
a
few
days
later
pulling
an
envelope
covered
with
from
his
pocket
this
for
the
ladies
department
oh
where
do
you
buy
your
hats
lady
and
where
do
you
buy
your
hose
and
where
do
you
buy
your
shoes
lady
and
where
your
underclothes
hats
shoes
and
stockings
everything
a
lady
heart
requires
quality
good
and
prices
low
we
are
the
largest
buyers
the
stock
we
bought
on
wednesday
last
is
fading
fast
away
it
may
be
too
late
oh
come
and
buy
fairfax
fairly
trumpeted
approval
if
they
all
as
good
as
that
he
said
you
must
have
more
money
yes
you
must
well
well
see
we
see
and
when
the
bon
marché
ballads
actually
appeared
the
generous
creature
insisted
on
adding
another
fifty
pounds
to
the
cheque
as
many
were
afterwards
of
opinion
that
henry
never
again
did
such
good
work
as
these
nonsense
rhymes
written
thus
for
a
frolic
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
as
copies
of
the
bon
marché
ballads
are
now
exceedingly
scarce
it
may
possibly
be
of
interest
to
quote
two
or
three
more
of
its
preposterous
numbers
this
is
a
lyric
illustrative
of
cheese
for
the
provision
department
you
fond
of
cheese
do
you
sometimes
sigh
for
a
really
good
gorgonzola
try
try
our
wonderfully
rotten
tasted
once
it
never
can
be
again
here
is
a
ballad
of
baby
toys
give
me
a
toy
the
baby
said
the
babe
of
three
months
old
oh
what
shall
i
buy
my
little
babee
with
silver
and
with
gold
i
would
you
buy
a
trumpet
fine
and
a
for
me
and
a
bucket
and
a
spade
mother
to
dig
beside
the
sea
but
where
shall
i
buy
these
pretty
things
the
mother
heart
inquires
oh
go
to
owens
cried
the
babe
they
are
the
largest
buyers
the
subject
of
our
last
selection
is
melton
mowbray
which
bore
beneath
its
title
due
apologies
to
swinburne
strange
pie
that
is
almost
a
passion
o
passion

the

and
unseen

the

the

that
is
marbled
and
mottled
the
pie
that
digests
with
a
sigh
for
all

not

that
is

and
all
is

that

of
all
the
goodness

that
henry
and
angel
were
to
owe
in
future
days
to
fairfax
there
is
not

in
this
book

that

chapter
xliii
still
another
caller
one
afternoon
the
step
coming
along
the
corridor
was
almost
light
enough
to
be
angel
though
a
lover
ear
told
him
that
hers
it
was
not
once
more
that
feminine
rustle
the
very
whisper
of
romantic
mystery
again
the
little
feminine
knock
daintiness
and
myrtilla
well
this
is
lovely
of
you
myrtilla
but
what
courage
how
did
you
ever
dare
venture
into
this
wild
and
savage
spot
this
of
bohemia
yes
it
was
brave
of
me
was
it
said
myrtilla
with
a
little
laugh
for
which
the
stairs
had
hardly
left
her
breath
but
what
a
climb
it
is
like
having
your
rooms
on
the
matterhorn
i
think
i
must
write
a
magazine
article
i
climbed
the
stairs
with
illustrations
and
we
could
have
some
quite
pretty
ones
she
said
looking
round
the
room
that
big
skylight
is
splendid
as
close
dear
lad
to
the
stars
as
you
can
get
it
are
you
as
devoted
to
them
as
ever
are
you
myrtilla
oh
yes
but
they
do
get
any
nearer
you
know
it
awfully
good
to
see
you
again
myrtilla
said
henry
going
over
to
her
and
taking
both
her
hands
it
quite
a
long
time
you
know
since
we
had
a
talk
it
was
a
sweet
thought
of
you
to
come
you
have
some
tea
wo
you
yes
i
should
love
to
see
you
make
tea
bachelors
always
make
such
good
tea
what
pretty
cups
my
word
we
are
dainty
i
suppose
it
was
esther
bought
them
for
you
henry
detected
the
little
trap
and
smiled
no
it
had
been
esther
no
someone
else
then
eh
i
think
i
can
guess
her
name
it
was
mean
of
you
not
to
tell
me
about
her
henry
i
hear
she
called
angel
and
that
she
looks
like
one
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
her
before
i
went
away
going
away
myrtilla
why
where
i
heard
nothing
of
it
tell
me
about
it
the
atmosphere
perceptibly
darkened
with
the
thought
of
williamson
well
she
said
in
the
little
airy
melodious
way
she
had
when
she
was
telling
something
particularly
unhappy
about
herself
a
sort
of
harpsichord
bravado
well
you
know
he
taken
to
fancying
himself
seriously
ill
lately
and
the
doctors
have
aided
and
abetted
him
and
so
we
going
to
davos
platz
or
some
such
and
well
that
all
and
you
i
suppose
are
to
nurse
the
to
nurse
him
said
henry
savagely
hush
lad
it
no
use
not
a
bit
you
wo
help
me
that
way
she
said
laying
her
hand
kindly
on
his
and
her
eyes
growing
bright
with
suppressed
tears
it
a
shame
nevertheless
myrtilla
a
cruel
shame
you
like
to
say
it
was
a
shame
would
you
dear
boy
well
you
can
if
you
like
but
then
you
must
say
no
more
and
if
you
really
want
to
help
me
you
shall
send
me
a
long
letter
now
and
again
with
some
of
your
new
poems
enclosed
and
tell
me
what
new
books
are
worth
sending
for
will
you
do
that
of
course
i
will
that
precious
little
to
do
anyhow
it
a
good
deal
really
but
be
sure
you
do
it
and
of
course
you
write
to
me
sometimes
i
do
think
you
know
yet
what
your
letters
are
to
me
i
never
work
so
well
as
when
i
had
a
letter
from
you
really
dear
lad
i
do
fancy
you
know
how
happy
that
makes
me
to
hear
yes
you
take
just
the
sort
of
interest
in
my
work
i
want
and
that
no
one
else
takes
not
even
angel
said
myrtilla
slily
angel
bless
her
loves
my
work
and
is
a
brave
little
critic
of
it
but
then
it
is
disloyal
to
her
to
say
that
she
does
know
as
much
as
you
besides
she
does
approach
it
in
quite
the
same
way
she
cares
for
it
first
because
it
is
mine
and
only
secondly
for
its
own
sake
now
you
care
for
it
just
for
what
it
is
i
care
for
it
certainly
for
what
it
going
to
be
said
myrtilla
making
one
of
those
honest
distinctions
which
made
her
opinion
so
stimulating
to
henry
yes
there
you
are
you
artistically
ambitious
for
me
you
know
what
i
want
to
do
even
before
i
know
myself
that
why
you
so
good
for
me
no
one
but
you
is
that
for
me
and
poor
stuff
as
i
know
it
is
never
write
a
word
without
wondering
what
you
will
think
of
it
you
sure
it
quite
true
said
myrtilla
do
say
so
if
it
is
because
you
know
you
saying
what
i
care
most
to
hear
perhaps
of
anything
you
could
say
you
know
how
i
love
literature
and
well
you
know
too
how
fond
i
am
of
you
dear
lad
do
you
literary
criticism
had
kindled
into
emotion
and
henry
bent
down
and
kissed
myrtilla
hand
in
return
she
let
her
hand
rest
a
moment
lightly
on
his
hair
and
then
rather
spasmodically
turned
to
remark
on
his
bookshelves
with
suspicious
energy
at
that
moment
another
step
was
heard
in
the
corridor
again
feminine
henry
knew
it
for
angel
and
it
may
be
that
his
expression
grew
a
shade
embarrassed
as
he
said
i
believe
i
shall
be
able
to
introduce
you
to
angel
after
all
for
i
think
this
is
she
coming
along
the
passage
as
henry
opened
the
door
angel
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
when
noticing
a
certain
constraint
in
his
manner
of
greeting
she
realised
that
he
was
not
alone
we
were
just
talking
of
you
dear
said
henry
this
is
my
friend
williamson
of
whom
you
often
heard
me
speak
oh
yes
i
often
heard
of
williamson
said
angel
not
of
course
suffering
the
irony
of
her
thought
to
escape
into
her
voice
and
i
heard
no
less
of
miss
flower
said
williamson
not
indeed
from
this
faithless
boy
here
for
i
have
seen
him
for
so
long
that
i
had
to
humble
myself
at
last
and
call
but
from
esther
myrtilla
loved
the
transparent
face
pulsing
with
light
flushing
or
fading
with
her
varying
mood
answering
with
exquisite
delicacy
to
any
advance
and
retreat
of
the
soul
within
but
an
invincible
prejudice
or
perhaps
rather
fear
shut
angel
eyes
from
the
appreciation
of
myrtilla
she
was
sweet
and
beautiful
but
to
the
child
that
angel
still
was
she
suggested
malign
artifice
angel
looked
at
her
as
an
imaginative
child
looks
at
the
moon
with
suspicion
so
in
spite
of
myrtilla
efforts
to
make
friends
the
conversation
sustained
a
distinct
loss
in
sprightliness
by
angel
arrival
myrtilla
perhaps
divining
a
little
of
the
truth
rose
to
go
well
i
afraid
it
quite
a
long
she
said
oh
you
going
away
said
angel
with
a
shade
of
relief
involuntarily
in
her
voice
oh
yes
perhaps
before
we
meet
again
you
and
henry
will
be
married
i
sure
i
sincerely
hope
so
thank
you
said
angel
somewhat
coldly
well
henry
said
myrtilla
it
was
rather
a
strangled
and
then
in
an
evil
moment
she
caught
sight
of
the
head
which
hidden
in
a
recess
she
had
not
noticed
before
i
see
you
still
faithful
to
the
dante
she
said
that
sweet
of
you
miss
flower
angel
perhaps
you
let
me
say
when
she
had
gone
there
seemed
a
curious
constraint
in
the
air
you
might
have
said
that
the
consistency
of
the
air
had
been
doubled
gravitation
was
at
least
twice
as
many
pounds
as
usual
to
the
square
inch
every
little
movement
seemed
heavy
as
though
the
medium
had
been
water
instead
of
air
as
henry
raised
his
hands
to
help
angel
off
with
her
jacket
they
seemed
weighted
with
lead
no
thank
you
said
angel
i
wo
take
it
off
i
ca
stay
long
why
dear
what
do
you
mean
i
thought
you
were
going
to
stay
the
evening
with
me
i
quite
a
long
new
chapter
to
read
to
you
i
sorry
henry
but
i
find
i
ca
why
dear
how
that
wo
you
tell
me
the
reason
has
anything
happened
angel
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
her
face
as
firmly
miserable
as
she
could
make
it
wo
you
tell
me
henry
pleaded
wo
you
speak
to
me
come
dear
what
the
matter
you
know
well
enough
henry
what
the
matter
came
an
unexpected
flash
of
speech
indeed
i
do
i
know
of
no
reason
whatever
how
should
i
well
then
williamson
the
matter
as
you
call
her
something
told
me
it
was
like
this
all
along
though
i
could
bear
to
doubt
you
and
so
i
put
it
away
i
wonder
how
often
she
been
here
when
i
have
known
nothing
about
it
this
is
the
very
first
time
she
has
ever
set
foot
in
these
rooms
said
henry
growing
cold
in
his
turn
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
if
you
need
it
i
do
want
to
hear
any
more
i
going
going
angel
said
henry
standing
between
her
and
the
door
what
can
you
mean
see
now
give
your
brains
a
chance
you
not
thinking
in
the
least
you
just
let
yourself
go
for
no
reason
at
all
you
be
sorry
reason
enough
i
should
think
when
i
find
that
you
love
another
woman
i
love
myrtilla
williamson
it
a
lie
angel
and
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
say
it
it
unworthy
of
you
why
have
you
never
told
me
then
who
made
that
sketch
of
dante
for
you
i
suppose
i
should
never
have
known
if
she
had
let
it
out
i
asked
you
once
but
you
put
me
off
henry
had
indeed
prevaricated
for
angel
had
chanced
to
ask
him
just
after
myrtilla
letter
about
his
poems
well
i
be
frank
said
henry
i
did
tell
you
just
because
i
feared
an
unreasonable
scene
like
this
if
there
had
been
nothing
in
it
there
was
nothing
to
fear
and
in
any
case
why
should
she
paint
pictures
for
you
if
she
does
care
for
you
no
i
going
nothing
will
persuade
me
otherwise
henry
please
let
pass
if
you
a
gentleman
and
poor
little
angel
face
fairly
flamed
no
power
on
earth
will
keep
me
here
all
right
angel
and
henry
let
her
have
her
way
her
feet
echoed
down
the
stairs
further
and
further
away
she
was
gone
and
henry
spent
that
evening
in
torturingly
imagining
every
kind
of
accident
that
might
happen
to
her
on
the
way
home
every
hour
he
expected
to
be
suddenly
called
to
look
at
her
dead
body
his
work
and
so
the
night
passed
and
the
morning
dawned
in
agony
so
went
the
whole
of
the
next
day
for
he
could
be
proud
too
and
the
fault
had
been
hers
thus
they
sat
apart
for
three
days
poles
of
determined
silence
and
then
at
last
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
henry
who
was
half
beside
himself
with
suspense
heard
with
wild
thankfulness
once
more
the
little
step
in
the
passage
it
seemed
fainter
he
thought
and
dragged
a
little
and
the
knock
at
the
door
was
like
a
ghost
there
with
a
wan
smile
angel
stood
and
with
joy
wordless
because
unspeakable
they
fell
almost
like
dead
things
into
each
other
arms
for
an
hour
they
sat
thus
and
never
spoke
a
word
only
stroking
each
other
hands
and
hair
it
was
so
good
for
each
to
know
that
the
other
was
alive
it
took
so
long
for
the
stored
agony
in
the
nerves
to
relax
i
have
eaten
a
morsel
since
wednesday
said
angel
at
last
nor
i
said
henry
henry
dear
i
sorry
i
know
now
i
was
wrong
i
give
you
my
word
never
to
doubt
you
again
thank
you
angel
do
let
us
even
think
of
it
any
more
i
could
live
through
it
again
darling
but
it
can
never
happen
any
more
can
it
no
but
if
you
ever
love
any
woman
better
than
you
love
me
tell
me
wo
you
i
could
bear
that
better
than
to
be
deceived
yes
angel
i
promise
to
tell
you
well
we
really
happy
again
now
are
we
i
can
hardly
believe
it
you
did
see
me
outside
your
house
last
night
did
you
henry
yes
i
was
there
and
i
watched
you
carry
the
light
into
your
bedroom
and
when
you
came
to
the
window
to
draw
down
the
blind
i
thought
you
must
have
seen
me
yes
i
waited
and
waited
till
i
saw
the
light
go
out
and
long
after
oh
henry
you
do
love
me
then
and
we
do
know
how
to
hate
each
other
sometimes
do
we
child
said
henry
laughing
into
angel
eyes
all
rainbows
and
tears

built

enough
for
two
and
mike
is
flying

flying
north
through
the
midnight
to
fetch
his
bride
henry
and
the
morning
meet
him
at
tyre
blessings
on
his
little
wrinkled
face
the
wrinkles
are
deeper
and
sweeter
by
a
year
hard
work
he
has
laughed
with
them
every
night
for
full
twelve
months
laughed
to
make
others
laugh
he
shall
laugh
for
himself
alone
the
very
river
seems
glad
and
tosses
its
shaggy
waves
like
a
faithful
dog
and
over
yonder
in
sidon
where
the
sun
is
building
a
shrine
of
gold
and
pearl
esther
sleepless
too
all
night
waits
at
a
window
like
the
oh
mike
mike
mike
is
it
you
at
last
oh
esther
esther
is
it
you
their
faces
were
so
bright
as
they
gazed
at
each
other
that
it
seemed
they
might
change
to
stars
and
wing
together
away
up
into
the
morning
henry
snatched
one
look
at
the
brightness
and
turned
away
she
looked
like
a
spirit
said
mike
as
they
met
again
further
along
the
road
he
looked
like
a
little
angel
said
esther
as
she
threw
herself
into
dot
sympathetic
arms
a
few
miles
from
sidon
there
stood
an
old
church
dim
with
memories
in
a
churchyard
mossy
with
many
graves
it
was
hither
some
few
hours
after
that
unwonted
carriages
were
driving
through
the
snow
of
that
happy
winter
day
in
one
of
them
esther
and
henry
were
sitting
esther
apparelled
in
but
here
the
local
papers
shall
speak
for
us
the
bride
it
said
was
attired
in
a
dress
of
grey
velvet
trimmed
with
beaver
and
a
large
picturesque
hat
with
feathers
to
match
she
carried
a
bouquet
of
white
chrysanthemums
and
hyacinths
the
very
earth
has
put
on
white
to
be
your
bridesmaid
said
henry
looking
out
on
the
sunlit
snow
after
all
though
of
course
i
sad
in
one
way
said
esther
more
practical
in
her
felicitations
i
glad
in
another
that
father
would
give
me
away
for
it
was
really
you
who
gave
me
to
mike
long
ago
was
it
and
so
it
only
as
it
should
be
that
you
should
give
me
to
him
you
never
forget
what
we
been
to
each
other
do
you
know
yes
but
our
love
has
no
organs
and
presents
and
to
bind
it
together
do
you
think
it
needs
it
of
course
not
but
it
would
be
fun
for
us
too
some
day
to
have
a
marriage
why
should
only
one
kind
of
love
have
its
marriage
ceremony
when
mike
and
your
wedding
is
over
let
tell
him
that
we
going
to
send
out
cards
for
ours
all
right
what
form
shall
the
ceremony
take
you
have
forgotten
i
shall
forget
just
the
second
after
you
not
before
and
no
i
be
mean
i
not
even
forget
you
then
kiss
me
esther
said
henry
kiss
me
again
esther
he
said
do
you
remember
the
cake
and
the
beating
yes
that
was
our
marriage
when
all
the
glory
of
that
happy
day
hung
in
crimson
low
down
in
the
west
like
a
chariot
of
fire
in
which
mike
and
esther
were
speeding
to
their
paradise
henry
walked
with
angel
homeward
through
the
streets
of
tyre
solemn
with
sunset
in
both
that
happy
day
still
lived
like
music
richly
dying
well
said
angel
in
words
far
too
practical
for
such
a
sunset
i
am
so
glad
it
all
went
off
so
well
poor
dear
mesurier
how
bonny
she
looked
and
your
dear
old
aunt
tipping
fancy
her
hiding
there
in
the
church
of
course
we
asked
her
said
henry
but
poor
old
thing
she
did
feel
grand
enough
as
she
would
say
to
come
publicly
and
your
poor
father
fancy
him
coming
home
for
the
lunch
like
that
after
all
it
was
logical
of
him
said
henry
i
suppose
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
resist
as
long
as
it
was
any
use
and
after
that
gracefully
give
in
and
he
was
always
fond
of
mike
but
did
esther
cry
when
he
kissed
her
and
said
that
since
chosen
mike
he
supposed
he
must
choose
him
too
and
mike
was
as
good
as
crying
too
i
think
every
one
was
poor
mother
was
just
a
mop
well
they
nearly
home
by
now
i
suppose
yes
another
or
so
oh
henry
fancy
how
wonderful
for
them
god
bless
them
i
glad
i
wonder
when
we
shall
get
our
home
said
henry
presently
oh
henry
never
mind
us
i
ca
think
of
any
one
but
them
well
dear
i
did
mean
to
be
selfish
i
was
only
wondering
how
long
you
be
willing
to
wait
for
me
suppose
i
were
to
say
ever
would
that
make
you
happy
well
i
think
dear
i
might
perhaps
arrange
things
by
then
the
end
