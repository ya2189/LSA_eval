in

the

vanishing

out
in

the
dead

introduction
to
the
manuscript
many
are
the
hours
in
which
i
have
pondered
upon
the
story
that
is
set
forth
in
the
following
pages
i
trust
that
my
instincts
are
not
awry
when
they
prompt
me
to
leave
the
account
in
simplicity
as
it
was
handed
to
me
and
the
itself
you
must
picture
me
when
first
it
was
given
into
my
care
turning
it
over
curiously
and
making
a
swift
jerky
examination
a
small
book
it
is
but
thick
and
all
save
the
last
few
pages
filled
with
a
quaint
but
legible
handwriting
and
writ
very
close
i
have
the
queer
faint
smell
of
it
in
my
nostrils
now
as
i
write
and
my
fingers
have
subconscious
memories
of
the
soft
cloggy
feel
of
the
pages
i
read
and
in
reading
lifted
the
curtains
of
the
impossible
that
blind
the
mind
and
looked
out
into
the
unknown
amid
stiff
abrupt
sentences
i
wandered
and
presently
i
had
no
fault
to
charge
against
their
abrupt
tellings
for
better
far
than
my
own
ambitious
phrasing
is
this
mutilated
story
capable
of
bringing
home
all
that
the
old
recluse
of
the
vanished
house
had
striven
to
tell
of
the
simple
stiffly
given
account
of
weird
and
extraordinary
matters
i
will
say
little
it
lies
before
you
the
inner
story
must
be
uncovered
personally
by
each
reader
according
to
ability
and
desire
and
even
should
any
fail
to
see
as
now
i
see
the
shadowed
picture
and
conception
of
that
to
which
one
may
well
give
the
accepted
titles
of
heaven
and
hell
yet
can
i
promise
certain
thrills
merely
taking
the
story
as
a
story

hodgson
december
the
finding
of
the
manuscript
right
away
in
the
west
of
ireland
lies
a
tiny
hamlet
called
kraighten
it
is
situated
alone
at
the
base
of
a
low
hill
far
around
there
spreads
a
waste
of
bleak
and
totally
inhospitable
country
where
here
and
there
at
great
intervals
one
may
come
upon
the
ruins
of
some
long
desolate
cottage
unthatched
and
stark
the
whole
land
is
bare
and
unpeopled
the
very
earth
scarcely
covering
the
rock
that
lies
beneath
it
and
with
which
the
country
abounds
in
places
rising
out
of
the
soil
in
ridges
yet
in
spite
of
its
desolation
my
friend
tonnison
and
i
had
elected
to
spend
our
vacation
there
he
had
stumbled
on
the
place
by
mere
chance
the
year
previously
during
the
course
of
a
long
walking
tour
and
discovered
the
possibilities
for
the
angler
in
a
small
and
unnamed
river
that
runs
past
the
outskirts
of
the
little
village
i
have
said
that
the
river
is
without
name
i
may
add
that
no
map
that
i
have
hitherto
consulted
has
shown
either
village
or
stream
they
seem
to
have
entirely
escaped
observation
indeed
they
might
never
exist
for
all
that
the
average
guide
tells
one
possibly
this
can
be
partly
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
nearest
railway
station
ardrahan
is
some
forty
miles
distant
it
was
early
one
warm
evening
when
my
friend
and
i
arrived
in
kraighten
we
had
reached
ardrahan
the
previous
night
sleeping
there
in
rooms
hired
at
the
village
post
office
and
leaving
in
good
time
on
the
following
morning
clinging
insecurely
to
one
of
the
typical
jaunting
cars
it
had
taken
us
all
day
to
accomplish
our
journey
over
some
of
the
roughest
tracks
imaginable
with
the
result
that
we
were
thoroughly
tired
and
somewhat
bad
tempered
however
the
tent
had
to
be
erected
and
our
goods
stowed
away
before
we
could
think
of
food
or
rest
and
so
we
set
to
work
with
the
aid
of
our
driver
and
soon
had
the
tent
up
upon
a
small
patch
of
ground
just
outside
the
little
village
and
quite
near
to
the
river
then
having
stored
all
our
belongings
we
dismissed
the
driver
as
he
had
to
make
his
way
back
as
speedily
as
possible
and
told
him
to
come
across
to
us
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
we
had
brought
sufficient
provisions
to
last
us
for
that
space
of
time
and
water
we
could
get
from
the
stream
fuel
we
did
not
need
as
we
had
included
a
small
among
our
outfit
and
the
weather
was
fine
and
warm
it
was
tonnison
idea
to
camp
out
instead
of
getting
lodgings
in
one
of
the
cottages
as
he
put
it
there
was
no
joke
in
sleeping
in
a
room
with
a
numerous
family
of
healthy
irish
in
one
corner
and
the
pigsty
in
the
other
while
overhead
a
ragged
colony
of
roosting
fowls
distributed
their
blessings
impartially
and
the
whole
place
so
full
of
peat
smoke
that
it
made
a
fellow
sneeze
his
head
off
just
to
put
it
inside
the
doorway
tonnison
had
got
the
stove
lit
now
and
was
busy
cutting
slices
of
bacon
into
the
frying
pan
so
i
took
the
kettle
and
walked
down
to
the
river
for
water
on
the
way
i
had
to
pass
close
to
a
little
group
of
the
village
people
who
eyed
me
curiously
but
not
in
any
unfriendly
manner
though
none
of
them
ventured
a
word
as
i
returned
with
my
kettle
filled
i
went
up
to
them
and
after
a
friendly
nod
to
which
they
replied
in
like
manner
i
asked
them
casually
about
the
fishing
but
instead
of
answering
they
just
shook
their
heads
silently
and
stared
at
me
i
repeated
the
question
addressing
more
particularly
a
great
gaunt
fellow
at
my
elbow
yet
again
i
received
no
answer
then
the
man
turned
to
a
comrade
and
said
something
rapidly
in
a
language
that
i
did
not
understand
and
at
once
the
whole
crowd
of
them
fell
to
jabbering
in
what
after
a
few
moments
i
guessed
to
be
pure
irish
at
the
same
time
they
cast
many
glances
in
my
direction
for
a
minute
perhaps
they
spoke
among
themselves
thus
then
the
man
i
had
addressed
faced
at
me
and
said
something
by
the
expression
of
his
face
i
guessed
that
he
in
turn
was
questioning
me
but
now
i
had
to
shake
my
head
and
indicate
that
i
did
not
comprehend
what
it
was
they
wanted
to
know
and
so
we
stood
looking
at
one
another
until
i
heard
tonnison
calling
to
me
to
hurry
up
with
the
kettle
then
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
i
left
them
and
all
in
the
little
crowd
smiled
and
nodded
in
return
though
their
faces
still
betrayed
their
puzzlement
it
was
evident
i
reflected
as
i
went
toward
the
tent
that
the
inhabitants
of
these
few
huts
in
the
wilderness
did
not
know
a
word
of
english
and
when
i
told
tonnison
he
remarked
that
he
was
aware
of
the
fact
and
more
that
it
was
not
at
all
uncommon
in
that
part
of
the
country
where
the
people
often
lived
and
died
in
their
isolated
hamlets
without
ever
coming
in
contact
with
the
outside
world
i
wish
we
had
got
the
driver
to
interpret
for
us
before
he
left
i
remarked
as
we
sat
down
to
our
meal
it
seems
so
strange
for
the
people
of
this
place
not
even
to
know
what
we
come
for
tonnison
grunted
an
assent
and
thereafter
was
silent
for
a
while
later
having
satisfied
our
appetites
somewhat
we
began
to
talk
laying
our
plans
for
the
morrow
then
after
a
smoke
we
closed
the
flap
of
the
tent
and
prepared
to
turn
in
i
suppose
there
no
chance
of
those
fellows
outside
taking
anything
i
asked
as
we
rolled
ourselves
in
our
blankets
tonnison
said
that
he
did
not
think
so
at
least
while
we
were
about
and
as
he
went
on
to
explain
we
could
lock
up
everything
except
the
tent
in
the
big
chest
that
we
had
brought
to
hold
our
provisions
i
agreed
to
this
and
soon
we
were
both
asleep
next
morning
early
we
rose
and
went
for
a
swim
in
the
river
after
which
we
dressed
and
had
breakfast
then
we
roused
out
our
fishing
tackle
and
overhauled
it
by
which
time
our
breakfasts
having
settled
somewhat
we
made
all
secure
within
the
tent
and
strode
off
in
the
direction
my
friend
had
explored
on
his
previous
visit
during
the
day
we
fished
happily
working
steadily
upstream
and
by
evening
we
had
one
of
the
prettiest
creels
of
fish
that
i
had
seen
for
a
long
while
returning
to
the
village
we
made
a
good
feed
off
our
spoil
after
which
having
selected
a
few
of
the
finer
fish
for
our
breakfast
we
presented
the
remainder
to
the
group
of
villagers
who
had
assembled
at
a
respectful
distance
to
watch
our
doings
they
seemed
wonderfully
grateful
and
heaped
mountains
of
what
i
presumed
to
be
irish
blessings
upon
our
heads
thus
we
spent
several
days
having
splendid
sport
and
appetites
to
do
justice
upon
our
prey
we
were
pleased
to
find
how
friendly
the
villagers
were
inclined
to
be
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
their
having
ventured
to
meddle
with
our
belongings
during
our
absences
it
was
on
a
tuesday
that
we
arrived
in
kraighten
and
it
would
be
on
the
sunday
following
that
we
made
a
great
discovery
hitherto
we
had
always
gone
on
that
day
however
we
laid
aside
our
rods
and
taking
some
provisions
set
off
for
a
long
ramble
in
the
opposite
direction
the
day
was
warm
and
we
trudged
along
leisurely
enough
stopping
about
to
eat
our
lunch
upon
a
great
flat
rock
near
the
riverbank
afterward
we
sat
and
smoked
awhile
resuming
our
walk
only
when
we
were
tired
of
inaction
for
perhaps
another
hour
we
wandered
onward
chatting
quietly
and
comfortably
on
this
and
that
matter
and
on
several
occasions
stopping
while
my
companion
who
is
something
of
an
artist
made
rough
sketches
of
striking
bits
of
the
wild
scenery
and
then
without
any
warning
whatsoever
the
river
we
had
followed
so
confidently
came
to
an
abrupt
end
vanishing
into
the
earth
good
lord
i
said
who
ever
would
have
thought
of
this
and
i
stared
in
amazement
then
i
turned
to
tonnison
he
was
looking
with
a
blank
expression
upon
his
face
at
the
place
where
the
river
disappeared
in
a
moment
he
spoke
let
us
go
on
a
bit
it
may
reappear
again
anyhow
it
is
worth
investigating
i
agreed
and
we
went
forward
once
more
though
rather
aimlessly
for
we
were
not
at
all
certain
in
which
direction
to
prosecute
our
search
for
perhaps
a
mile
we
moved
onward
then
tonnison
who
had
been
gazing
about
curiously
stopped
and
shaded
his
eyes
see
he
said
after
a
moment
is
that
mist
or
something
over
there
to
the
right
away
in
a
line
with
that
great
piece
of
rock
and
he
indicated
with
his
hand
i
stared
and
after
a
minute
seemed
to
see
something
but
could
not
be
certain
and
said
so
anyway
my
friend
replied
we
just
go
across
and
have
a
glance
and
he
started
off
in
the
direction
he
had
suggested
i
following
presently
we
came
among
bushes
and
after
a
time
out
upon
the
top
of
a
high
bank
from
which
we
looked
down
into
a
wilderness
of
bushes
and
trees
seems
as
though
we
had
come
upon
an
oasis
in
this
desert
of
stone
muttered
tonnison
as
he
gazed
interestedly
then
he
was
silent
his
eyes
fixed
and
i
looked
also
for
up
from
somewhere
about
the
center
of
the
wooded
lowland
there
rose
high
into
the
quiet
air
a
great
column
of
hazelike
spray
upon
which
the
sun
shone
causing
innumerable
rainbows
how
beautiful
i
exclaimed
yes
answered
tonnison
thoughtfully
there
must
be
a
waterfall
or
something
over
there
perhaps
it
our
river
come
to
light
again
go
and
see
down
the
sloping
bank
we
made
our
way
and
entered
among
the
trees
and
shrubberies
the
bushes
were
matted
and
the
trees
overhung
us
so
that
the
place
was
disagreeably
gloomy
though
not
dark
enough
to
hide
from
me
the
fact
that
many
of
the
trees
were
fruit
trees
and
that
here
and
there
one
could
trace
indistinctly
signs
of
a
long
departed
cultivation
thus
it
came
to
me
that
we
were
making
our
way
through
the
riot
of
a
great
and
ancient
garden
i
said
as
much
to
tonnison
and
he
agreed
that
there
certainly
seemed
reasonable
grounds
for
my
belief
what
a
wild
place
it
was
so
dismal
and
somber
somehow
as
we
went
forward
a
sense
of
the
silent
loneliness
and
desertion
of
the
old
garden
grew
upon
me
and
i
felt
shivery
one
could
imagine
things
lurking
among
the
tangled
bushes
while
in
the
very
air
of
the
place
there
seemed
something
uncanny
i
think
tonnison
was
conscious
of
this
also
though
he
said
nothing
suddenly
we
came
to
a
halt
through
the
trees
there
had
grown
upon
our
ears
a
distant
sound
tonnison
bent
forward
listening
i
could
hear
it
more
plainly
now
it
was
continuous
and
harsh
a
sort
of
droning
roar
seeming
to
come
from
far
away
i
experienced
a
queer
indescribable
little
feeling
of
nervousness
what
sort
of
place
was
it
into
which
we
had
got
i
looked
at
my
companion
to
see
what
he
thought
of
the
matter
and
noted
that
there
was
only
puzzlement
in
his
face
and
then
as
i
watched
his
features
an
expression
of
comprehension
crept
over
them
and
he
nodded
his
head
that
a
waterfall
he
exclaimed
with
conviction
i
know
the
sound
now
and
he
began
to
push
vigorously
through
the
bushes
in
the
direction
of
the
noise
as
we
went
forward
the
sound
became
plainer
continually
showing
that
we
were
heading
straight
toward
it
steadily
the
roaring
grew
louder
and
nearer
until
it
appeared
as
i
remarked
to
tonnison
almost
to
come
from
under
our
feet
and
still
we
were
surrounded
by
the
trees
and
shrubs
take
care
tonnison
called
to
me
look
where
you
going
and
then
suddenly
we
came
out
from
among
the
trees
on
to
a
great
open
space
where
not
six
paces
in
front
of
us
yawned
the
mouth
of
a
tremendous
chasm
from
the
depths
of
which
the
noise
appeared
to
rise
along
with
the
continuous
mistlike
spray
that
we
had
witnessed
from
the
top
of
the
distant
bank
for
quite
a
minute
we
stood
in
silence
staring
in
bewilderment
at
the
sight
then
my
friend
went
forward
cautiously
to
the
edge
of
the
abyss
i
followed
and
together
we
looked
down
through
a
boil
of
spray
at
a
monster
cataract
of
frothing
water
that
burst
spouting
from
the
side
of
the
chasm
nearly
a
hundred
feet
below
good
lord
said
tonnison
i
was
silent
and
rather
awed
the
sight
was
so
unexpectedly
grand
and
eerie
though
this
latter
quality
came
more
upon
me
later
presently
i
looked
up
and
across
to
the
further
side
of
the
chasm
there
i
saw
something
towering
up
among
the
spray
it
looked
like
a
fragment
of
a
great
ruin
and
i
touched
tonnison
on
the
shoulder
he
glanced
with
a
start
and
i
pointed
toward
the
thing
his
gaze
followed
my
finger
and
his
eyes
lighted
up
with
a
sudden
flash
of
excitement
as
the
object
came
within
his
field
of
view
come
along
he
shouted
above
the
uproar
we
have
a
look
at
it
there
something
queer
about
this
place
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
and
he
started
off
the
edge
of
the
craterlike
abyss
as
we
neared
this
new
thing
i
saw
that
i
had
not
been
mistaken
in
my
first
impression
it
was
undoubtedly
a
portion
of
some
ruined
building
yet
now
i
made
out
that
it
was
not
built
upon
the
edge
of
the
chasm
itself
as
i
had
at
first
supposed
but
perched
almost
at
the
extreme
end
of
a
huge
spur
of
rock
that
jutted
out
some
fifty
or
sixty
feet
over
the
abyss
in
fact
the
jagged
mass
of
ruin
was
literally
suspended
in
midair
arriving
opposite
it
we
walked
out
on
to
the
projecting
arm
of
rock
and
i
must
confess
to
having
felt
an
intolerable
sense
of
terror
as
i
looked
down
from
that
dizzy
perch
into
the
unknown
depths
below
us
into
the
deeps
from
which
there
rose
ever
the
thunder
of
the
falling
water
and
the
shroud
of
rising
spray
reaching
the
ruin
we
clambered
it
cautiously
and
on
the
further
side
came
upon
a
mass
of
fallen
stones
and
rubble
the
ruin
itself
seemed
to
me
as
i
proceeded
now
to
examine
it
minutely
to
be
a
portion
of
the
outer
wall
of
some
prodigious
structure
it
was
so
thick
and
substantially
built
yet
what
it
was
doing
in
such
a
position
i
could
by
no
means
conjecture
where
was
the
rest
of
the
house
or
castle
or
whatever
there
had
been
i
went
back
to
the
outer
side
of
the
wall
and
thence
to
the
edge
of
the
chasm
leaving
tonnison
rooting
systematically
among
the
heap
of
stones
and
rubbish
on
the
outer
side
then
i
commenced
to
examine
the
surface
of
the
ground
near
the
edge
of
the
abyss
to
see
whether
there
were
not
left
other
remnants
of
the
building
to
which
the
fragment
of
ruin
evidently
belonged
but
though
i
scrutinized
the
earth
with
the
greatest
care
i
could
see
no
signs
of
anything
to
show
that
there
had
ever
been
a
building
erected
on
the
spot
and
i
grew
more
puzzled
than
ever
then
i
heard
a
cry
from
tonnison
he
was
shouting
my
name
excitedly
and
without
delay
i
hurried
along
the
rocky
promontory
to
the
ruin
i
wondered
whether
he
had
hurt
himself
and
then
the
thought
came
that
perhaps
he
had
found
something
i
reached
the
crumbled
wall
and
climbed
there
i
found
tonnison
standing
within
a
small
excavation
that
he
had
made
among
the
he
was
brushing
the
dirt
from
something
that
looked
like
a
book
much
crumpled
and
dilapidated
and
opening
his
mouth
every
second
or
two
to
bellow
my
name
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
i
had
come
he
handed
his
prize
to
me
telling
me
to
put
it
into
my
satchel
so
as
to
protect
it
from
the
damp
while
he
continued
his
explorations
this
i
did
first
however
running
the
pages
through
my
fingers
and
noting
that
they
were
closely
filled
with
neat
writing
which
was
quite
legible
save
in
one
portion
where
many
of
the
pages
were
almost
destroyed
being
muddied
and
crumpled
as
though
the
book
had
been
doubled
back
at
that
part
this
i
found
out
from
tonnison
was
actually
as
he
had
discovered
it
and
the
damage
was
due
probably
to
the
fall
of
masonry
upon
the
opened
part
curiously
enough
the
book
was
fairly
dry
which
i
attributed
to
its
having
been
so
securely
buried
among
the
ruins
having
put
the
volume
away
safely
i
and
gave
tonnison
a
hand
with
his
task
of
excavating
yet
though
we
put
in
over
an
hour
hard
work
turning
over
the
whole
of
the
upheaped
stones
and
rubbish
we
came
upon
nothing
more
than
some
fragments
of
broken
wood
that
might
have
been
parts
of
a
desk
or
table
and
so
we
gave
up
searching
and
went
back
along
the
rock
once
more
to
the
safety
of
the
land
the
next
thing
we
did
was
to
make
a
complete
tour
of
the
tremendous
chasm
which
we
were
able
to
observe
was
in
the
form
of
an
almost
perfect
circle
save
for
where
the
spur
of
rock
jutted
out
spoiling
its
symmetry
the
abyss
was
as
tonnison
put
it
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
gigantic
well
or
pit
going
sheer
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
for
some
time
longer
we
continued
to
stare
about
us
and
then
noticing
that
there
was
a
clear
space
away
to
the
north
of
the
chasm
we
bent
our
steps
in
that
direction
here
distant
from
the
mouth
of
the
mighty
pit
by
some
hundreds
of
yards
we
came
upon
a
great
lake
of
silent
water
silent
that
is
save
in
one
place
where
there
was
a
continuous
bubbling
and
gurgling
now
being
away
from
the
noise
of
the
spouting
cataract
we
were
able
to
hear
one
another
speak
without
having
to
shout
at
the
tops
of
our
voices
and
i
asked
tonnison
what
he
thought
of
the
place
i
told
him
that
i
did
like
it
and
that
the
sooner
we
were
out
of
it
the
better
i
should
be
pleased
he
nodded
in
reply
and
glanced
at
the
woods
behind
furtively
i
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
or
heard
anything
he
made
no
answer
but
stood
silent
as
though
listening
and
i
kept
quiet
also
suddenly
he
spoke
hark
he
said
sharply
i
looked
at
him
and
then
away
among
the
trees
and
bushes
holding
my
breath
involuntarily
a
minute
came
and
went
in
strained
silence
yet
i
could
hear
nothing
and
i
turned
to
tonnison
to
say
as
much
and
then
even
as
i
opened
my
lips
to
speak
there
came
a
strange
wailing
noise
out
of
the
wood
on
our
left
it
appeared
to
float
through
the
trees
and
there
was
a
rustle
of
stirring
leaves
and
then
silence
all
at
once
tonnison
spoke
and
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
let
us
get
out
of
here
he
said
and
began
to
move
slowly
toward
where
the
surrounding
trees
and
bushes
seemed
thinnest
as
i
followed
him
it
came
to
me
suddenly
that
the
sun
was
low
and
that
there
was
a
raw
sense
of
chilliness
in
the
air
tonnison
said
nothing
further
but
kept
on
steadily
we
were
among
the
trees
now
and
i
glanced
around
nervously
but
saw
nothing
save
the
quiet
branches
and
trunks
and
the
tangled
bushes
onward
we
went
and
no
sound
broke
the
silence
except
the
occasional
snapping
of
a
twig
under
our
feet
as
we
moved
forward
yet
in
spite
of
the
quietness
i
had
a
horrible
feeling
that
we
were
not
alone
and
i
kept
so
close
to
tonnison
that
twice
i
kicked
his
heels
clumsily
though
he
said
nothing
a
minute
and
then
another
and
we
reached
the
confines
of
the
wood
coming
out
at
last
upon
the
bare
rockiness
of
the
countryside
only
then
was
i
able
to
shake
off
the
haunting
dread
that
had
followed
me
among
the
trees
once
as
we
moved
away
there
seemed
to
come
again
a
distant
sound
of
wailing
and
i
said
to
myself
that
it
was
the
wind
yet
the
evening
was
breathless
presently
tonnison
began
to
talk
look
you
he
said
with
decision
i
would
not
spend
the
night
in
place
for
all
the
wealth
that
the
world
holds
there
is
something
unholy
diabolical
about
it
it
came
to
me
all
in
a
moment
just
after
you
spoke
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
woods
were
full
of
vile
things
you
know
yes
i
answered
and
looked
back
toward
the
place
but
it
was
hidden
from
us
by
a
rise
in
the
ground
there
the
book
i
said
and
i
put
my
hand
into
the
satchel
you
got
it
safely
he
questioned
with
a
sudden
access
of
anxiety
yes
i
replied
perhaps
he
continued
we
shall
learn
something
from
it
when
we
get
back
to
the
tent
we
had
better
hurry
too
we
a
long
way
off
still
and
i
do
fancy
now
being
caught
out
here
in
the
dark
it
was
two
hours
later
when
we
reached
the
tent
and
without
delay
we
set
to
work
to
prepare
a
meal
for
we
had
eaten
nothing
since
our
lunch
at
midday
supper
over
we
cleared
the
things
out
of
the
way
and
lit
our
pipes
then
tonnison
asked
me
to
get
the
manuscript
out
of
my
satchel
this
i
did
and
then
as
we
could
not
both
read
from
it
at
the
same
time
he
suggested
that
i
should
read
the
thing
out
loud
and
mind
he
cautioned
knowing
my
propensities
do
go
skipping
half
the
book
yet
had
he
but
known
what
it
contained
he
would
have
realized
how
needless
such
advice
was
for
once
at
least
and
there
seated
in
the
opening
of
our
little
tent
i
began
the
strange
tale
of
house
on
the
for
such
was
the
title
of
the
this
is
told
in
the
following
pages
the
plain
of
silence
i
am
an
old
man
i
live
here
in
this
ancient
house
surrounded
by
huge
unkempt
gardens
the
peasantry
who
inhabit
the
wilderness
beyond
say
that
i
am
mad
that
is
because
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
i
live
here
alone
with
my
old
sister
who
is
also
my
housekeeper
we
keep
no
servants
i
hate
them
i
have
one
friend
a
dog
yes
i
would
sooner
have
old
pepper
than
the
rest
of
creation
together
he
at
least
understands
me
and
has
sense
enough
to
leave
me
alone
when
i
am
in
my
dark
moods
i
have
decided
to
start
a
kind
of
diary
it
may
enable
me
to
record
some
of
the
thoughts
and
feelings
that
i
can
not
express
to
anyone
but
beyond
this
i
am
anxious
to
make
some
record
of
the
strange
things
that
i
have
heard
and
seen
during
many
years
of
loneliness
in
this
weird
old
building
for
a
couple
of
centuries
this
house
has
had
a
reputation
a
bad
one
and
until
i
bought
it
for
more
than
eighty
years
no
one
had
lived
here
consequently
i
got
the
old
place
at
a
ridiculously
low
figure
i
am
not
superstitious
but
i
have
ceased
to
deny
that
things
happen
in
this
old
house
things
that
i
can
not
explain
and
therefore
i
must
needs
ease
my
mind
by
writing
down
an
account
of
them
to
the
best
of
my
ability
though
should
this
my
diary
ever
be
read
when
i
am
gone
the
readers
will
but
shake
their
heads
and
be
the
more
convinced
that
i
was
mad
this
house
how
ancient
it
is
though
its
age
strikes
one
less
perhaps
than
the
quaintness
of
its
structure
which
is
curious
and
fantastic
to
the
last
degree
little
curved
towers
and
pinnacles
with
outlines
suggestive
of
leaping
flames
predominate
while
the
body
of
the
building
is
in
the
form
of
a
circle
i
have
heard
that
there
is
an
old
story
told
amongst
the
country
people
to
the
effect
that
the
devil
built
the
place
however
that
is
as
may
be
true
or
not
i
neither
know
nor
care
save
as
it
may
have
helped
to
cheapen
it
ere
i
came
i
must
have
been
here
some
ten
years
before
i
saw
sufficient
to
warrant
any
belief
in
the
stories
current
in
the
neighborhood
about
this
house
it
is
true
that
i
had
on
at
least
a
dozen
occasions
seen
vaguely
things
that
puzzled
me
and
perhaps
had
felt
more
than
i
had
seen
then
as
the
years
passed
bringing
age
upon
me
i
became
often
aware
of
something
unseen
yet
unmistakably
present
in
the
empty
rooms
and
corridors
still
it
was
as
i
have
said
many
years
before
i
saw
any
real
manifestations
of
the
supernatural
it
was
not
halloween
if
i
were
telling
a
story
for
amusement
sake
i
should
probably
place
it
on
that
night
of
nights
but
this
is
a
true
record
of
my
own
experiences
and
i
would
not
put
pen
to
paper
to
amuse
anyone
no
it
was
after
midnight
on
the
morning
of
the
day
of
january
i
was
sitting
reading
as
is
often
my
custom
in
my
study
pepper
lay
sleeping
near
my
chair
without
warning
the
flames
of
the
two
candles
went
low
and
then
shone
with
a
ghastly
green
effulgence
i
looked
up
quickly
and
as
i
did
so
i
saw
the
lights
sink
into
a
dull
ruddy
tint
so
that
the
room
glowed
with
a
strange
heavy
crimson
twilight
that
gave
the
shadows
behind
the
chairs
and
tables
a
double
depth
of
blackness
and
wherever
the
light
struck
it
was
as
though
luminous
blood
had
been
splashed
over
the
room
down
on
the
floor
i
heard
a
faint
frightened
whimper
and
something
pressed
itself
in
between
my
two
feet
it
was
pepper
cowering
under
my
dressing
gown
pepper
usually
as
brave
as
a
lion
it
was
this
movement
of
the
dog
i
think
that
gave
me
the
first
twinge
of
fear
i
had
been
considerably
startled
when
the
lights
burnt
first
green
and
then
red
but
had
been
momentarily
under
the
impression
that
the
change
was
due
to
some
influx
of
noxious
gas
into
the
room
now
however
i
saw
that
it
was
not
so
for
the
candles
burned
with
a
steady
flame
and
showed
no
signs
of
going
out
as
would
have
been
the
case
had
the
change
been
due
to
fumes
in
the
atmosphere
i
did
not
move
i
felt
distinctly
frightened
but
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
do
than
wait
for
perhaps
a
minute
i
kept
my
glance
about
the
room
nervously
then
i
noticed
that
the
lights
had
commenced
to
sink
very
slowly
until
presently
they
showed
minute
specks
of
red
fire
like
the
gleamings
of
rubies
in
the
darkness
still
i
sat
watching
while
a
sort
of
dreamy
indifference
seemed
to
steal
over
me
banishing
altogether
the
fear
that
had
begun
to
grip
me
away
in
the
far
end
of
the
huge
room
i
became
conscious
of
a
faint
glow
steadily
it
grew
filling
the
room
with
gleams
of
quivering
green
light
then
they
sank
quickly
and
changed
even
as
the
candle
flames
had
done
into
a
deep
somber
crimson
that
strengthened
and
lit
up
the
room
with
a
flood
of
awful
glory
the
light
came
from
the
end
wall
and
grew
ever
brighter
until
its
intolerable
glare
caused
my
eyes
acute
pain
and
involuntarily
i
closed
them
it
may
have
been
a
few
seconds
before
i
was
able
to
open
them
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
that
the
light
had
decreased
greatly
so
that
it
no
longer
tried
my
eyes
then
as
it
grew
still
duller
i
was
aware
all
at
once
that
instead
of
looking
at
the
redness
i
was
staring
through
it
and
through
the
wall
beyond
gradually
as
i
became
more
accustomed
to
the
idea
i
realized
that
i
was
looking
out
on
to
a
vast
plain
lit
with
the
same
gloomy
twilight
that
pervaded
the
room
the
immensity
of
this
plain
scarcely
can
be
conceived
in
no
part
could
i
perceive
its
confines
it
seemed
to
broaden
and
spread
out
so
that
the
eye
failed
to
perceive
any
limitations
slowly
the
details
of
the
nearer
portions
began
to
grow
clear
then
in
a
moment
almost
the
light
died
away
and
the
vision
if
vision
it
were
faded
and
was
gone
suddenly
i
became
conscious
that
i
was
no
longer
in
the
chair
instead
i
seemed
to
be
hovering
above
it
and
looking
down
at
a
dim
something
huddled
and
silent
in
a
little
while
a
cold
blast
struck
me
and
i
was
outside
in
the
night
floating
like
a
bubble
up
through
the
darkness
as
i
moved
an
icy
coldness
seemed
to
enfold
me
so
that
i
shivered
after
a
time
i
looked
to
right
and
left
and
saw
the
intolerable
blackness
of
the
night
pierced
by
remote
gleams
of
fire
onward
outward
i
drove
once
i
glanced
behind
and
saw
the
earth
a
small
crescent
of
blue
light
receding
away
to
my
left
further
off
the
sun
a
splash
of
white
flame
burned
vividly
against
the
dark
an
indefinite
period
passed
then
for
the
last
time
i
saw
the
earth
an
enduring
globule
of
radiant
blue
swimming
in
an
eternity
of
ether
and
there
i
a
fragile
flake
of
soul
dust
flickered
silently
across
the
void
from
the
distant
blue
into
the
expanse
of
the
unknown
a
great
while
seemed
to
pass
over
me
and
now
i
could
nowhere
see
anything
i
had
passed
beyond
the
fixed
stars
and
plunged
into
the
huge
blackness
that
waits
beyond
all
this
time
i
had
experienced
little
save
a
sense
of
lightness
and
cold
discomfort
now
however
the
atrocious
darkness
seemed
to
creep
into
my
soul
and
i
became
filled
with
fear
and
despair
what
was
going
to
become
of
me
where
was
i
going
even
as
the
thoughts
were
formed
there
grew
against
the
impalpable
blackness
that
wrapped
me
a
faint
tinge
of
blood
it
seemed
extraordinarily
remote
and
mistlike
yet
at
once
the
feeling
of
oppression
was
lightened
and
i
no
longer
despaired
slowly
the
distant
redness
became
plainer
and
larger
until
as
i
drew
nearer
it
spread
out
into
a
great
somber
glare
dull
and
tremendous
still
i
fled
onward
and
presently
i
had
come
so
close
that
it
seemed
to
stretch
beneath
me
like
a
great
ocean
of
somber
red
i
could
see
little
save
that
it
appeared
to
spread
out
interminably
in
all
directions
in
a
further
space
i
found
that
i
was
descending
upon
it
and
soon
i
sank
into
a
great
sea
of
sullen
clouds
slowly
i
emerged
from
these
and
there
below
me
i
saw
the
stupendous
plain
that
i
had
seen
from
my
room
in
this
house
that
stands
upon
the
borders
of
the
silences
presently
i
landed
and
stood
surrounded
by
a
great
waste
of
loneliness
the
place
was
lit
with
a
gloomy
twilight
that
gave
an
impression
of
indescribable
desolation
afar
to
my
right
within
the
sky
there
burnt
a
gigantic
ring
of
fire
from
the
outer
edge
of
which
were
projected
huge
writhing
flames
darted
and
jagged
the
interior
of
this
ring
was
black
black
as
the
gloom
of
the
outer
night
i
comprehended
at
once
that
it
was
from
this
extraordinary
sun
that
the
place
derived
its
doleful
light
from
that
strange
source
of
light
i
glanced
down
again
to
my
surroundings
everywhere
i
looked
i
saw
nothing
but
the
same
flat
weariness
of
interminable
plain
nowhere
could
i
descry
any
signs
of
life
not
even
the
ruins
of
some
ancient
habitation
gradually
i
found
that
i
was
being
borne
forward
floating
across
the
flat
waste
for
what
seemed
an
eternity
i
moved
onward
i
was
unaware
of
any
great
sense
of
impatience
though
some
curiosity
and
a
vast
wonder
were
with
me
continually
always
i
saw
around
me
the
breadth
of
that
enormous
plain
and
always
i
searched
for
some
new
thing
to
break
its
monotony
but
there
was
no
change
only
loneliness
silence
and
desert
presently
in
a
manner
i
noticed
that
there
was
a
faint
mistiness
ruddy
in
hue
lying
over
its
surface
still
when
i
looked
more
intently
i
was
unable
to
say
that
it
was
really
mist
for
it
appeared
to
blend
with
the
plain
giving
it
a
peculiar
unrealness
and
conveying
to
the
senses
the
idea
of
unsubstantiality
gradually
i
began
to
weary
with
the
sameness
of
the
thing
yet
it
was
a
great
time
before
i
perceived
any
signs
of
the
place
toward
which
i
was
being
conveyed
at
first
i
saw
it
far
ahead
like
a
long
hillock
on
the
surface
of
the
plain
then
as
i
drew
nearer
i
perceived
that
i
had
been
mistaken
for
instead
of
a
low
hill
i
made
out
now
a
chain
of
great
mountains
whose
distant
peaks
towered
up
into
the
red
gloom
until
they
were
almost
lost
to
sight
the
house
in
the
arena
and
so
after
a
time
i
came
to
the
mountains
then
the
course
of
my
journey
was
altered
and
i
began
to
move
along
their
bases
until
all
at
once
i
saw
that
i
had
come
opposite
to
a
vast
rift
opening
into
the
mountains
through
this
i
was
borne
moving
at
no
great
speed
on
either
side
of
me
huge
scarped
walls
of
rocklike
substance
rose
sheer
far
overhead
i
discerned
a
thin
ribbon
of
red
where
the
mouth
of
the
chasm
opened
among
inaccessible
peaks
within
was
gloom
deep
and
somber
and
chilly
silence
for
a
while
i
went
onward
steadily
and
then
at
last
i
saw
ahead
a
deep
red
glow
that
told
me
i
was
near
upon
the
further
opening
of
the
gorge
a
minute
came
and
went
and
i
was
at
the
exit
of
the
chasm
staring
out
upon
an
enormous
amphitheatre
of
mountains
yet
of
the
mountains
and
the
terrible
grandeur
of
the
place
i
recked
nothing
for
i
was
confounded
with
amazement
to
behold
at
a
distance
of
several
miles
and
occupying
the
center
of
the
arena
a
stupendous
structure
built
apparently
of
green
jade
yet
in
itself
it
was
not
the
discovery
of
the
building
that
had
so
astonished
me
but
the
fact
which
became
every
moment
more
apparent
that
in
no
particular
save
in
color
and
its
enormous
size
did
the
lonely
structure
vary
from
this
house
in
which
i
live
for
a
while
i
continued
to
stare
fixedly
even
then
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
i
saw
aright
in
my
mind
a
question
formed
reiterating
incessantly
does
it
mean
does
it
mean
and
i
was
unable
to
make
answer
even
out
of
the
depths
of
my
imagination
i
seemed
capable
only
of
wonder
and
fear
for
a
time
longer
i
gazed
noting
continually
some
fresh
point
of
resemblance
that
attracted
me
at
last
wearied
and
sorely
puzzled
i
turned
from
it
to
view
the
rest
of
the
strange
place
on
to
which
i
had
intruded
hitherto
i
had
been
so
engrossed
in
my
scrutiny
of
the
house
that
i
had
given
only
a
cursory
glance
now
as
i
looked
i
began
to
realize
upon
what
sort
of
a
place
i
had
come
the
arena
for
so
i
have
termed
it
appeared
a
perfect
circle
of
about
ten
to
twelve
miles
in
diameter
the
house
as
i
have
mentioned
before
standing
in
the
center
the
surface
of
the
place
like
to
that
of
the
plain
had
a
peculiar
misty
appearance
that
was
yet
not
mist
from
a
rapid
survey
my
glance
passed
quickly
upward
along
the
slopes
of
the
circling
mountains
how
silent
they
were
i
think
that
this
same
abominable
stillness
was
more
trying
to
me
than
anything
that
i
had
so
far
seen
or
imagined
i
was
looking
up
now
at
the
great
crags
towering
so
loftily
up
there
the
impalpable
redness
gave
a
blurred
appearance
to
everything
and
then
as
i
peered
curiously
a
new
terror
came
to
me
for
away
up
among
the
dim
peaks
to
my
right
i
had
descried
a
vast
shape
of
blackness
giantlike
it
grew
upon
my
sight
it
had
an
enormous
equine
head
with
gigantic
ears
and
seemed
to
peer
steadfastly
down
into
the
arena
there
was
that
about
the
pose
that
gave
me
the
impression
of
an
eternal
watchfulness
of
having
warded
that
dismal
place
through
unknown
eternities
slowly
the
monster
became
plainer
to
me
and
then
suddenly
my
gaze
sprang
from
it
to
something
further
off
and
higher
among
the
crags
for
a
long
minute
i
gazed
fearfully
i
was
strangely
conscious
of
something
not
altogether
unfamiliar
as
though
something
stirred
in
the
back
of
my
mind
the
thing
was
black
and
had
four
grotesque
arms
the
features
showed
indistinctly
the
neck
i
made
out
several
objects
slowly
the
details
came
to
me
and
i
realized
coldly
that
they
were
skulls
further
down
the
body
was
another
circling
belt
showing
less
dark
against
the
black
trunk
then
even
as
i
puzzled
to
know
what
the
thing
was
a
memory
slid
into
my
mind
and
straightway
i
knew
that
i
was
looking
at
a
monstrous
representation
of
kali
the
hindu
goddess
of
death
other
remembrances
of
my
old
student
days
drifted
into
my
thoughts
my
glance
fell
back
upon
the
huge
thing
simultaneously
i
recognized
it
for
the
ancient
egyptian
god
set
or
seth
the
destroyer
of
souls
with
the
knowledge
there
came
a
great
sweep
of
questioning
of
the
i
stopped
and
endeavored
to
think
things
beyond
my
imagination
peered
into
my
frightened
mind
i
saw
obscurely
old
gods
of
mythology
i
tried
to
comprehend
to
what
it
was
all
pointing
my
gaze
dwelt
flickeringly
between
the
two
an
idea
came
swiftly
and
i
turned
and
glanced
rapidly
upward
searching
the
gloomy
crags
away
to
my
left
something
loomed
out
under
a
great
peak
a
shape
of
greyness
i
wondered
i
had
not
seen
it
earlier
and
then
remembered
i
had
not
yet
viewed
that
portion
i
saw
it
more
plainly
now
it
was
as
i
have
said
grey
it
had
a
tremendous
head
but
no
eyes
that
part
of
its
face
was
blank
now
i
saw
that
there
were
other
things
up
among
the
mountains
further
off
reclining
on
a
lofty
ledge
i
made
out
a
livid
mass
irregular
and
ghoulish
it
seemed
without
form
save
for
an
unclean
face
that
looked
out
vilely
from
somewhere
about
its
middle
and
then
i
saw
others
there
were
hundreds
of
them
they
seemed
to
grow
out
of
the
shadows
several
i
recognized
almost
immediately
as
mythological
deities
others
were
strange
to
me
utterly
strange
beyond
the
power
of
a
human
mind
to
conceive
on
each
side
i
looked
and
saw
more
continually
the
mountains
were
full
of
strange
things
and
horrors
so
atrocious
and
bestial
that
possibility
and
decency
deny
any
further
attempt
to
describe
them
and
i
i
was
filled
with
a
terrible
sense
of
overwhelming
horror
and
fear
and
repugnance
yet
spite
of
these
i
wondered
exceedingly
was
there
then
after
all
something
in
the
old
heathen
worship
something
more
than
the
mere
deifying
of
men
animals
and
elements
the
thought
gripped
me
was
there
later
a
question
repeated
itself
what
were
they
those
and
the
others
at
first
they
had
appeared
to
me
just
sculptured
monsters
placed
indiscriminately
among
the
inaccessible
peaks
and
precipices
of
the
surrounding
mountains
now
as
i
scrutinized
them
with
greater
intentness
my
mind
began
to
reach
out
to
fresh
conclusions
there
was
something
about
them
an
indescribable
sort
of
silent
vitality
that
suggested
to
my
broadening
consciousness
a
state
of
a
something
that
was
by
no
means
life
as
we
understand
it
but
rather
an
inhuman
form
of
existence
that
well
might
be
likened
to
a
deathless
trance
a
condition
in
which
it
was
possible
to
imagine
their
continuing
eternally
the
word
rose
in
my
thoughts
unbidden
and
straightway
i
grew
to
wondering
whether
this
might
be
the
immortality
of
the
gods
and
then
in
the
midst
of
my
wondering
and
musing
something
happened
until
then
i
had
been
staying
just
within
the
shadow
of
the
exit
of
the
great
rift
now
without
volition
on
my
part
i
drifted
out
of
the
and
began
to
move
slowly
across
the
arena
toward
the
house
at
this
i
gave
up
all
thoughts
of
those
prodigious
shapes
above
me
and
could
only
stare
frightenedly
at
the
tremendous
structure
toward
which
i
was
being
conveyed
so
remorselessly
yet
though
i
searched
earnestly
i
could
discover
nothing
that
i
had
not
already
seen
and
so
became
gradually
calmer
presently
i
had
reached
a
point
more
than
halfway
between
the
house
and
the
gorge
all
around
was
spread
the
stark
loneliness
of
the
place
and
the
unbroken
silence
steadily
i
neared
the
great
building
then
all
at
once
something
caught
my
vision
something
that
came
one
of
the
huge
buttresses
of
the
house
and
so
into
full
view
it
was
a
gigantic
thing
and
moved
with
a
curious
lope
going
almost
upright
after
the
manner
of
a
man
it
was
quite
unclothed
and
had
a
remarkable
luminous
appearance
yet
it
was
the
face
that
attracted
and
frightened
me
the
most
it
was
the
face
of
a
swine
silently
intently
i
watched
this
horrible
creature
and
forgot
my
fear
momentarily
in
my
interest
in
its
movements
it
was
making
its
way
cumbrously
the
building
stopping
as
it
came
to
each
window
to
peer
in
and
shake
at
the
bars
with
which
as
in
this
house
they
were
protected
and
whenever
it
came
to
a
door
it
would
push
at
it
fingering
the
fastening
stealthily
evidently
it
was
searching
for
an
ingress
into
the
house
i
had
come
now
to
within
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
great
structure
and
still
i
was
compelled
forward
abruptly
the
thing
turned
and
gazed
hideously
in
my
direction
it
opened
its
mouth
and
for
the
first
time
the
stillness
of
that
abominable
place
was
broken
by
a
deep
booming
note
that
sent
an
added
thrill
of
apprehension
through
me
then
immediately
i
became
aware
that
it
was
coming
toward
me
swiftly
and
silently
in
an
instant
it
had
covered
half
the
distance
that
lay
between
and
still
i
was
borne
helplessly
to
meet
it
only
a
hundred
yards
and
the
brutish
ferocity
of
the
giant
face
numbed
me
with
a
feeling
of
unmitigated
horror
i
could
have
screamed
in
the
supremeness
of
my
fear
and
then
in
the
very
moment
of
my
extremity
and
despair
i
became
conscious
that
i
was
looking
down
upon
the
arena
from
a
rapidly
increasing
height
i
was
rising
rising
in
an
inconceivably
short
while
i
had
reached
an
altitude
of
many
hundred
feet
beneath
me
the
spot
that
i
had
just
left
was
occupied
by
the
foul
it
had
gone
down
on
all
fours
and
was
snuffing
and
rooting
like
a
veritable
hog
at
the
surface
of
the
arena
a
moment
and
it
rose
to
its
feet
clutching
upward
with
an
expression
of
desire
upon
its
face
such
as
i
have
never
seen
in
this
world
continually
i
mounted
higher
a
few
minutes
it
seemed
and
i
had
risen
above
the
great
mountains
floating
alone
afar
in
the
redness
at
a
tremendous
distance
below
the
arena
showed
dimly
with
the
mighty
house
looking
no
larger
than
a
tiny
spot
of
green
the
was
no
longer
visible
presently
i
passed
over
the
mountains
out
above
the
huge
breadth
of
the
plain
far
away
on
its
surface
in
the
direction
of
the
sun
there
showed
a
confused
blur
i
looked
toward
it
indifferently
it
reminded
me
somewhat
of
the
first
glimpse
i
had
caught
of
the
with
a
sense
of
weariness
i
glanced
upward
at
the
immense
ring
of
fire
what
a
strange
thing
it
was
then
as
i
stared
out
from
the
dark
center
there
spurted
a
sudden
flare
of
extraordinary
vivid
fire
compared
with
the
size
of
the
black
center
it
was
as
naught
yet
in
itself
stupendous
with
awakened
interest
i
watched
it
carefully
noting
its
strange
boiling
and
glowing
then
in
a
moment
the
whole
thing
grew
dim
and
unreal
and
so
passed
out
of
sight
much
amazed
i
glanced
down
to
the
plain
from
which
i
was
still
rising
thus
i
received
a
fresh
surprise
the
plain
everything
had
vanished
and
only
a
sea
of
red
mist
was
spread
far
below
me
gradually
as
i
stared
this
grew
remote
and
died
away
into
a
dim
far
mystery
of
red
against
an
unfathomable
night
a
while
and
even
this
had
gone
and
i
was
wrapped
in
an
impalpable
lightless
gloom
the
earth
thus
i
was
and
only
the
memory
that
i
had
lived
through
the
dark
once
before
served
to
sustain
my
thoughts
a
great
time
passed
ages
and
then
a
single
star
broke
its
way
through
the
darkness
it
was
the
first
of
one
of
the
outlying
clusters
of
this
universe
presently
it
was
far
behind
and
all
about
me
shone
the
splendor
of
the
countless
stars
later
years
it
seemed
i
saw
the
sun
a
clot
of
flame
around
it
i
made
out
presently
several
remote
specks
of
light
the
planets
of
the
solar
system
and
so
i
saw
the
earth
again
blue
and
unbelievably
minute
it
grew
larger
and
became
defined
a
long
space
of
time
came
and
went
and
then
at
last
i
entered
into
the
shadow
of
the
world
plunging
headlong
into
the
dim
and
holy
earth
night
overhead
were
the
old
constellations
and
there
was
a
crescent
moon
then
as
i
neared
the
earth
surface
a
dimness
swept
over
me
and
i
appeared
to
sink
into
a
black
mist
for
a
while
i
knew
nothing
i
was
unconscious
gradually
i
became
aware
of
a
faint
distant
whining
it
became
plainer
a
desperate
feeling
of
agony
possessed
me
i
struggled
madly
for
breath
and
tried
to
shout
a
moment
and
i
got
my
breath
more
easily
i
was
conscious
that
something
was
licking
my
hand
something
damp
swept
across
my
face
i
heard
a
panting
and
then
again
the
whining
it
seemed
to
come
to
my
ears
now
with
a
sense
of
familiarity
and
i
opened
my
eyes
all
was
dark
but
the
feeling
of
oppression
had
left
me
i
was
seated
and
something
was
whining
piteously
and
licking
me
i
felt
strangely
confused
and
instinctively
tried
to
ward
off
the
thing
that
licked
my
head
was
curiously
vacant
and
for
the
moment
i
seemed
incapable
of
action
or
thought
then
things
came
back
to
me
and
i
called
faintly
i
was
answered
by
a
joyful
bark
and
renewed
and
frantic
caresses
in
a
little
while
i
felt
stronger
and
put
out
my
hand
for
the
matches
i
groped
about
for
a
few
moments
blindly
then
my
hands
lit
upon
them
and
i
struck
a
light
and
looked
confusedly
around
all
about
me
i
saw
the
old
familiar
things
and
there
i
sat
full
of
dazed
wonders
until
the
flame
of
the
match
burnt
my
finger
and
i
dropped
it
while
a
hasty
expression
of
pain
and
anger
escaped
my
lips
surprising
me
with
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
after
a
moment
i
struck
another
match
and
stumbling
across
the
room
lit
the
candles
as
i
did
so
i
observed
that
they
had
not
burned
away
but
had
been
put
out
as
the
flames
shot
up
i
turned
and
stared
about
the
study
yet
there
was
nothing
unusual
to
see
and
suddenly
a
gust
of
irritation
took
me
what
had
happened
i
held
my
head
with
both
hands
and
tried
to
remember
ah
the
great
silent
plain
and
the
sun
of
red
fire
where
were
they
where
had
i
seen
them
how
long
ago
i
felt
dazed
and
muddled
once
or
twice
i
walked
up
and
down
the
room
unsteadily
my
memory
seemed
dulled
and
already
the
thing
i
had
witnessed
came
back
to
me
with
an
effort
i
have
a
remembrance
of
cursing
peevishly
in
my
bewilderment
suddenly
i
turned
faint
and
giddy
and
had
to
grasp
at
the
table
for
support
during
a
few
moments
i
held
on
weakly
and
then
managed
to
totter
sideways
into
a
chair
after
a
little
time
i
felt
somewhat
better
and
succeeded
in
reaching
the
cupboard
where
usually
i
keep
brandy
and
biscuits
i
poured
myself
out
a
little
of
the
stimulant
and
drank
it
off
then
taking
a
handful
of
biscuits
i
returned
to
my
chair
and
began
to
devour
them
ravenously
i
was
vaguely
surprised
at
my
hunger
i
felt
as
though
i
had
eaten
nothing
for
an
uncountably
long
while
as
i
ate
my
glance
roved
about
the
room
taking
in
its
various
details
and
still
searching
though
almost
unconsciously
for
something
tangible
upon
which
to
take
hold
among
the
invisible
mysteries
that
encompassed
me
i
thought
must
be
something
and
in
the
same
instant
my
gaze
dwelt
upon
the
face
of
the
clock
in
the
opposite
corner
therewith
i
stopped
eating
and
just
stared
for
though
its
ticking
indicated
most
certainly
that
it
was
still
going
the
hands
were
pointing
to
a
little
the
hour
of
midnight
whereas
it
was
as
well
i
knew
considerably
that
time
when
i
had
witnessed
the
first
of
the
strange
happenings
i
have
just
described
for
perhaps
a
moment
i
was
astounded
and
puzzled
had
the
hour
been
the
same
as
when
i
had
last
seen
the
clock
i
should
have
concluded
that
the
hands
had
stuck
in
one
place
while
the
internal
mechanism
went
on
as
usual
but
that
would
in
no
way
account
for
the
hands
having
traveled
backward
then
even
as
i
turned
the
matter
over
in
my
wearied
brain
the
thought
flashed
upon
me
that
it
was
now
close
upon
the
morning
of
the
and
that
i
had
been
unconscious
to
the
visible
world
through
the
greater
portion
of
the
last
hours
the
thought
occupied
my
attention
for
a
full
minute
then
i
commenced
to
eat
again
i
was
still
very
hungry
during
breakfast
next
morning
i
inquired
casually
of
my
sister
regarding
the
date
and
found
my
surmise
correct
i
had
indeed
been
absent
at
least
in
spirit
for
nearly
a
day
and
a
night
my
sister
asked
me
no
questions
for
it
is
not
by
any
means
the
first
time
that
i
have
kept
to
my
study
for
a
whole
day
and
sometimes
a
couple
of
days
at
a
time
when
i
have
been
particularly
engrossed
in
my
books
or
work
and
so
the
days
pass
on
and
i
am
still
filled
with
a
wonder
to
know
the
meaning
of
all
that
i
saw
on
that
memorable
night
yet
well
i
know
that
my
curiosity
is
little
likely
to
be
satisfied
the
thing
in
the
pit
this
house
is
as
i
have
said
before
surrounded
by
a
huge
estate
and
wild
and
uncultivated
gardens
away
at
the
back
distant
some
three
hundred
yards
is
a
dark
deep
ravine
spoken
of
as
the
by
the
peasantry
at
the
bottom
runs
a
sluggish
stream
so
overhung
by
trees
as
scarcely
to
be
seen
from
above
in
passing
i
must
explain
that
this
river
has
a
subterranean
origin
emerging
suddenly
at
the
east
end
of
the
ravine
and
disappearing
as
abruptly
beneath
the
cliffs
that
form
its
western
extremity
it
was
some
months
after
my
vision
if
vision
it
were
of
the
great
plain
that
my
attention
was
particularly
attracted
to
the
pit
i
happened
one
day
to
be
walking
along
its
southern
edge
when
suddenly
several
pieces
of
rock
and
shale
were
dislodged
from
the
face
of
the
cliff
immediately
beneath
me
and
fell
with
a
sullen
crash
through
the
trees
i
heard
them
splash
in
the
river
at
the
bottom
and
then
silence
i
should
not
have
given
this
incident
more
than
a
passing
thought
had
not
pepper
at
once
begun
to
bark
savagely
nor
would
he
be
silent
when
i
bade
him
which
is
most
unusual
behavior
on
his
part
feeling
that
there
must
be
someone
or
something
in
the
pit
i
went
back
to
the
house
quickly
for
a
stick
when
i
returned
pepper
had
ceased
his
barks
and
was
growling
and
smelling
uneasily
along
the
top
whistling
to
him
to
follow
me
i
started
to
descend
cautiously
the
depth
to
the
bottom
of
the
pit
must
be
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
and
some
time
as
well
as
considerable
care
was
expended
before
we
reached
the
bottom
in
safety
once
down
pepper
and
i
started
to
explore
along
the
banks
of
the
river
it
was
very
dark
there
due
to
the
overhanging
trees
and
i
moved
warily
keeping
my
glance
about
me
and
my
stick
ready
pepper
was
quiet
now
and
kept
close
to
me
all
the
time
thus
we
searched
right
up
one
side
of
the
river
without
hearing
or
seeing
anything
then
we
crossed
over
by
the
simple
method
of
jumping
and
commenced
to
beat
our
way
back
through
the
underbrush
we
had
accomplished
perhaps
half
the
distance
when
i
heard
again
the
sound
of
falling
stones
on
the
other
side
the
side
from
which
we
had
just
come
one
large
rock
came
thundering
down
through
the
treetops
struck
the
opposite
bank
and
bounded
into
the
river
driving
a
great
jet
of
water
right
over
us
at
this
pepper
gave
out
a
deep
growl
then
stopped
and
pricked
up
his
ears
i
listened
also
a
second
later
a
loud
squeal
sounded
from
among
the
trees
apparently
about
halfway
up
the
south
cliff
it
was
answered
by
a
similar
note
from
the
bottom
of
the
pit
at
this
pepper
gave
a
short
sharp
bark
and
springing
across
the
little
river
disappeared
into
the
bushes
immediately
afterward
i
heard
his
barks
increase
in
depth
and
number
and
in
between
there
sounded
a
noise
of
confused
jabbering
this
ceased
and
in
the
succeeding
silence
there
rose
a
yell
of
agony
almost
immediately
pepper
gave
a
howl
of
pain
and
then
the
shrubs
were
violently
agitated
and
he
came
running
out
with
his
tail
down
and
glancing
as
he
ran
over
his
shoulder
as
he
reached
me
i
saw
that
he
was
bleeding
from
what
appeared
to
be
a
great
claw
wound
in
the
side
that
had
almost
laid
bare
his
ribs
seeing
pepper
thus
mutilated
a
furious
feeling
of
anger
seized
me
and
whirling
my
staff
i
sprang
across
and
into
the
bushes
from
which
pepper
had
emerged
as
i
forced
my
way
through
i
thought
i
heard
a
sound
of
breathing
next
instant
i
had
burst
into
a
little
clear
space
just
in
time
to
see
something
livid
white
in
color
disappear
among
the
bushes
on
the
opposite
side
with
a
shout
i
ran
toward
it
but
though
i
struck
and
probed
among
the
bushes
with
my
stick
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
further
and
so
returned
to
pepper
there
after
bathing
his
wound
in
the
river
i
bound
my
wetted
handkerchief
his
body
having
done
which
we
retreated
up
the
ravine
and
into
the
daylight
again
on
reaching
the
house
my
sister
inquired
what
had
happened
to
pepper
and
i
told
her
he
had
been
fighting
with
a
wildcat
of
which
i
had
heard
there
were
several
about
i
felt
it
would
be
better
not
to
tell
her
how
it
had
really
happened
though
to
be
sure
i
scarcely
knew
myself
but
this
i
did
know
that
the
thing
i
had
seen
run
into
the
bushes
was
no
wildcat
it
was
much
too
big
and
had
so
far
as
i
had
observed
a
skin
like
a
hog
only
of
a
dead
unhealthy
white
color
and
then
it
had
run
upright
or
nearly
so
upon
its
hind
feet
with
a
motion
somewhat
resembling
that
of
a
human
being
this
much
i
had
noticed
in
my
brief
glimpse
and
truth
to
tell
i
felt
a
good
deal
of
uneasiness
besides
curiosity
as
i
turned
the
matter
over
in
my
mind
it
was
in
the
morning
that
the
above
incident
had
occurred
then
it
would
be
after
dinner
as
i
sat
reading
that
happening
to
look
up
suddenly
i
saw
something
peering
in
over
the
window
ledge
the
eyes
and
ears
alone
showing
pig
by
jove
i
said
and
rose
to
my
feet
thus
i
saw
the
thing
more
completely
but
it
was
no
pig
god
alone
knows
what
it
was
it
reminded
me
vaguely
of
the
hideous
thing
that
had
haunted
the
great
arena
it
had
a
grotesquely
human
mouth
and
jaw
but
with
no
chin
of
which
to
speak
the
nose
was
prolonged
into
a
snout
thus
it
was
that
with
the
little
eyes
and
queer
ears
gave
it
such
an
extraordinarily
swinelike
appearance
of
forehead
there
was
little
and
the
whole
face
was
of
an
unwholesome
white
color
for
perhaps
a
minute
i
stood
looking
at
the
thing
with
an
ever
growing
feeling
of
disgust
and
some
fear
the
mouth
kept
jabbering
inanely
and
once
emitted
a
grunt
i
think
it
was
the
eyes
that
attracted
me
the
most
they
seemed
to
glow
at
times
with
a
horribly
human
intelligence
and
kept
flickering
away
from
my
face
over
the
details
of
the
room
as
though
my
stare
disturbed
it
it
appeared
to
be
supporting
itself
by
two
clawlike
hands
upon
the
windowsill
these
claws
unlike
the
face
were
of
a
clayey
brown
hue
and
bore
an
indistinct
resemblance
to
human
hands
in
that
they
had
four
fingers
and
a
thumb
though
these
were
webbed
up
to
the
first
joint
much
as
are
a
duck
nails
it
had
also
but
so
long
and
powerful
that
they
were
more
like
the
talons
of
an
eagle
than
aught
else
as
i
have
said
before
i
felt
some
fear
though
almost
of
an
impersonal
kind
i
may
explain
my
feeling
better
by
saying
that
it
was
more
a
sensation
of
abhorrence
such
as
one
might
expect
to
feel
if
brought
in
contact
with
something
superhumanly
foul
something
unholy
belonging
to
some
hitherto
undreamt
of
state
of
existence
i
can
not
say
that
i
grasped
these
various
details
of
the
brute
at
the
time
i
think
they
seemed
to
come
back
to
me
afterward
as
though
imprinted
upon
my
brain
i
imagined
more
than
i
saw
as
i
looked
at
the
thing
and
the
material
details
grew
upon
me
later
for
perhaps
a
minute
i
stared
at
the
creature
then
as
my
nerves
steadied
a
little
i
shook
off
the
vague
alarm
that
held
me
and
took
a
step
toward
the
window
even
as
i
did
so
the
thing
ducked
and
vanished
i
rushed
to
the
door
and
looked
hurriedly
but
only
the
tangled
bushes
and
shrubs
met
my
gaze
i
ran
back
into
the
house
and
getting
my
gun
sallied
out
to
search
through
the
gardens
as
i
went
i
asked
myself
whether
the
thing
i
had
just
seen
was
likely
to
be
the
same
of
which
i
had
caught
a
glimpse
in
the
morning
i
inclined
to
think
it
was
i
would
have
taken
pepper
with
me
but
judged
it
better
to
give
his
wound
a
chance
to
heal
besides
if
the
creature
i
had
just
seen
was
as
i
imagined
his
antagonist
of
the
morning
it
was
not
likely
that
he
would
be
of
much
use
i
began
my
search
systematically
i
was
determined
if
it
were
possible
to
find
and
put
an
end
to
that
this
was
at
least
a
material
horror
at
first
i
searched
cautiously
with
the
thought
of
pepper
wound
in
my
mind
but
as
the
hours
passed
and
not
a
sign
of
anything
living
showed
in
the
great
lonely
gardens
i
became
less
apprehensive
i
felt
almost
as
though
i
would
welcome
the
sight
of
it
anything
seemed
better
than
this
silence
with
the
feeling
that
the
creature
might
be
lurking
in
every
bush
i
passed
later
i
grew
careless
of
danger
to
the
extent
of
plunging
right
through
the
bushes
probing
with
my
gun
barrel
as
i
went
at
times
i
shouted
but
only
the
echoes
answered
back
i
thought
thus
perhaps
to
frighten
or
stir
the
creature
to
showing
itself
but
only
succeeded
in
bringing
my
sister
mary
out
to
know
what
was
the
matter
i
told
her
that
i
had
seen
the
wildcat
that
had
wounded
pepper
and
that
i
was
trying
to
hunt
it
out
of
the
bushes
she
seemed
only
half
satisfied
and
went
back
into
the
house
with
an
expression
of
doubt
upon
her
face
i
wondered
whether
she
had
seen
or
guessed
anything
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
i
prosecuted
the
search
anxiously
i
felt
that
i
should
be
unable
to
sleep
with
that
bestial
thing
haunting
the
shrubberies
and
yet
when
evening
fell
i
had
seen
nothing
then
as
i
turned
homeward
i
heard
a
short
unintelligible
noise
among
the
bushes
to
my
right
instantly
i
turned
and
aiming
quickly
fired
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
immediately
afterward
i
heard
something
scuttling
away
among
the
bushes
it
moved
rapidly
and
in
a
minute
had
gone
out
of
hearing
after
a
few
steps
i
ceased
my
pursuit
realizing
how
futile
it
must
be
in
the
fast
gathering
gloom
and
so
with
a
curious
feeling
of
depression
i
entered
the
house
that
night
after
my
sister
had
gone
to
bed
i
went
to
all
the
windows
and
doors
on
the
ground
floor
and
saw
to
it
that
they
were
securely
fastened
this
precaution
was
scarcely
necessary
as
regards
the
windows
as
all
of
those
on
the
lower
storey
are
strongly
barred
but
with
the
doors
of
which
there
are
five
it
was
wisely
thought
as
not
one
was
locked
having
secured
these
i
went
to
my
study
yet
somehow
for
once
the
place
jarred
upon
me
it
seemed
so
huge
and
echoey
for
some
time
i
tried
to
read
but
at
last
finding
it
impossible
i
carried
my
book
down
to
the
kitchen
where
a
large
fire
was
burning
and
sat
there
i
dare
say
i
had
read
for
a
couple
of
hours
when
suddenly
i
heard
a
sound
that
made
me
lower
my
book
and
listen
intently
it
was
a
noise
of
something
rubbing
and
fumbling
against
the
back
door
once
the
door
creaked
loudly
as
though
force
were
being
applied
to
it
during
those
few
short
moments
i
experienced
an
indescribable
feeling
of
terror
such
as
i
should
have
believed
impossible
my
hands
shook
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
me
and
i
shivered
violently
gradually
i
calmed
the
stealthy
movements
outside
had
ceased
then
for
an
hour
i
sat
silent
and
watchful
all
at
once
the
feeling
of
fear
took
me
again
i
felt
as
i
imagine
an
animal
must
under
the
eye
of
a
snake
yet
now
i
could
hear
nothing
still
there
was
no
doubting
that
some
unexplained
influence
was
at
work
gradually
imperceptibly
almost
something
stole
on
my
ear
a
sound
that
resolved
itself
into
a
faint
murmur
quickly
it
developed
and
grew
into
a
muffled
but
hideous
chorus
of
bestial
shrieks
it
appeared
to
rise
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
i
heard
a
thud
and
realized
in
a
dull
half
comprehending
way
that
i
had
dropped
my
book
after
that
i
just
sat
and
thus
the
daylight
found
me
when
it
crept
wanly
in
through
the
barred
high
windows
of
the
great
kitchen
with
the
dawning
light
the
feeling
of
stupor
and
fear
left
me
and
i
came
more
into
possession
of
my
senses
thereupon
i
picked
up
my
book
and
crept
to
the
door
to
listen
not
a
sound
broke
the
chilly
silence
for
some
minutes
i
stood
there
then
very
gradually
and
cautiously
i
drew
back
the
bolt
and
opening
the
door
peeped
out
my
caution
was
unneeded
nothing
was
to
be
seen
save
the
grey
vista
of
dreary
tangled
bushes
and
trees
extending
to
the
distant
plantation
with
a
shiver
i
closed
the
door
and
made
my
way
quietly
up
to
bed
the
it
was
evening
a
week
later
my
sister
sat
in
the
garden
knitting
i
was
walking
up
and
down
reading
my
gun
leant
up
against
the
wall
of
the
house
for
since
the
advent
of
that
strange
thing
in
the
gardens
i
had
deemed
it
wise
to
take
precautions
yet
through
the
whole
week
there
had
been
nothing
to
alarm
me
either
by
sight
or
sound
so
that
i
was
able
to
look
back
calmly
to
the
incident
though
still
with
a
sense
of
unmitigated
wonder
and
curiosity
i
was
as
i
have
just
said
walking
up
and
down
and
somewhat
engrossed
in
my
book
suddenly
i
heard
a
crash
away
in
the
direction
of
the
pit
with
a
quick
movement
i
turned
and
saw
a
tremendous
column
of
dust
rising
high
into
the
evening
air
my
sister
had
risen
to
her
feet
with
a
sharp
exclamation
of
surprise
and
fright
telling
her
to
stay
where
she
was
i
snatched
up
my
gun
and
ran
toward
the
pit
as
i
neared
it
i
heard
a
dull
rumbling
sound
that
grew
quickly
into
a
roar
split
with
deeper
crashes
and
up
from
the
pit
drove
a
fresh
volume
of
dust
the
noise
ceased
though
the
dust
still
rose
tumultuously
i
reached
the
edge
and
looked
down
but
could
see
nothing
save
a
boil
of
dust
clouds
swirling
hither
and
thither
the
air
was
so
full
of
the
small
particles
that
they
blinded
and
choked
me
and
finally
i
had
to
run
out
from
the
smother
to
breathe
gradually
the
suspended
matter
sank
and
hung
in
a
panoply
over
the
mouth
of
the
pit
i
could
only
guess
at
what
had
happened
that
there
had
been
a
of
some
kind
i
had
little
doubt
but
the
cause
was
beyond
my
knowledge
and
yet
even
then
i
had
half
imaginings
for
already
the
thought
had
come
to
me
of
those
falling
rocks
and
that
thing
in
the
bottom
of
the
pit
but
in
the
first
minutes
of
confusion
i
failed
to
reach
the
natural
conclusion
to
which
the
catastrophe
pointed
slowly
the
dust
subsided
until
presently
i
was
able
to
approach
the
edge
and
look
down
for
a
while
i
peered
impotently
trying
to
see
through
the
reek
at
first
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
anything
then
as
i
stared
i
saw
something
below
to
my
left
that
moved
i
looked
intently
toward
it
and
presently
made
out
another
and
then
another
three
dim
shapes
that
appeared
to
be
climbing
up
the
side
of
the
pit
i
could
see
them
only
indistinctly
even
as
i
stared
and
wondered
i
heard
a
rattle
of
stones
somewhere
to
my
right
i
glanced
across
but
could
see
nothing
i
leant
forward
and
peered
over
and
down
into
the
pit
just
beneath
where
i
stood
and
saw
no
further
than
a
hideous
white
that
had
risen
to
within
a
couple
of
yards
of
my
feet
below
it
i
could
make
out
several
others
as
the
thing
saw
me
it
gave
a
sudden
uncouth
squeal
which
was
answered
from
all
parts
of
the
pit
at
that
a
gust
of
horror
and
fear
took
me
and
bending
down
i
discharged
my
gun
right
into
its
face
straightway
the
creature
disappeared
with
a
clatter
of
loose
earth
and
stones
there
was
a
momentary
silence
to
which
probably
i
owe
my
life
for
during
it
i
heard
a
quick
patter
of
many
feet
and
turning
sharply
saw
a
troop
of
the
creatures
coming
toward
me
at
a
run
instantly
i
raised
my
gun
and
fired
at
the
foremost
who
plunged
with
a
hideous
howling
then
i
turned
to
run
more
than
halfway
from
the
house
to
the
pit
i
saw
my
sister
she
was
coming
toward
me
i
could
not
see
her
face
distinctly
as
the
dusk
had
fallen
but
there
was
fear
in
her
voice
as
she
called
to
know
why
i
was
shooting
i
shouted
in
reply
for
your
life
without
more
ado
she
turned
and
fled
picking
up
her
skirts
with
both
hands
as
i
followed
i
gave
a
glance
behind
the
brutes
were
running
on
their
hind
legs
at
times
dropping
on
all
fours
i
think
it
must
have
been
the
terror
in
my
voice
that
spurred
mary
to
run
so
for
i
feel
convinced
that
she
had
not
as
yet
seen
those
hell
creatures
that
pursued
on
we
went
my
sister
leading
each
moment
the
nearing
sounds
of
the
footsteps
told
me
that
the
brutes
were
gaining
on
us
rapidly
fortunately
i
am
accustomed
to
live
in
some
ways
an
active
life
as
it
was
the
strain
of
the
race
was
beginning
to
tell
severely
upon
me
ahead
i
could
see
the
back
door
luckily
it
was
open
i
was
some
yards
behind
mary
now
and
my
breath
was
sobbing
in
my
throat
then
something
touched
my
shoulder
i
wrenched
my
head
quickly
and
saw
one
of
those
monstrous
pallid
faces
close
to
mine
one
of
the
creatures
having
outrun
its
companions
had
almost
overtaken
me
even
as
i
turned
it
made
a
fresh
grab
with
a
sudden
effort
i
sprang
to
one
side
and
swinging
my
gun
by
the
barrel
brought
it
crashing
down
upon
the
foul
creature
head
the
thing
dropped
with
an
almost
human
groan
even
this
short
delay
had
been
nearly
sufficient
to
bring
the
rest
of
the
brutes
down
upon
me
so
that
without
an
instant
waste
of
time
i
turned
and
ran
for
the
door
reaching
it
i
burst
into
the
passage
then
turning
quickly
slammed
and
bolted
the
door
just
as
the
first
of
the
creatures
rushed
against
it
with
a
sudden
shock
my
sister
sat
gasping
in
a
chair
she
seemed
in
a
fainting
condition
but
i
had
no
time
then
to
spend
on
her
i
had
to
make
sure
that
all
the
doors
were
fastened
fortunately
they
were
the
one
leading
from
my
study
into
the
gardens
was
the
last
to
which
i
went
i
had
just
had
time
to
note
that
it
was
secured
when
i
thought
i
heard
a
noise
outside
i
stood
perfectly
silent
and
listened
yes
now
i
could
distinctly
hear
a
sound
of
whispering
and
something
slithered
over
the
panels
with
a
rasping
scratchy
noise
evidently
some
of
the
brutes
were
feeling
with
their
about
the
door
to
discover
whether
there
were
any
means
of
ingress
that
the
creatures
should
so
soon
have
found
the
door
was
to
me
a
proof
of
their
reasoning
capabilities
it
assured
me
that
they
must
not
be
regarded
by
any
means
as
mere
animals
i
had
felt
something
of
this
before
when
that
first
thing
peered
in
through
my
window
then
i
had
applied
the
term
superhuman
to
it
with
an
almost
instinctive
knowledge
that
the
creature
was
something
different
from
the
something
beyond
human
yet
in
no
good
sense
but
rather
as
something
foul
and
hostile
to
the
and
in
humanity
in
a
word
as
something
intelligent
and
yet
inhuman
the
very
thought
of
the
creatures
filled
me
with
revulsion
now
i
bethought
me
of
my
sister
and
going
to
the
cupboard
i
got
out
a
flask
of
brandy
and
a
taking
these
i
went
down
to
the
kitchen
carrying
a
lighted
candle
with
me
she
was
not
sitting
in
the
chair
but
had
fallen
out
and
was
lying
upon
the
floor
face
downward
very
gently
i
turned
her
over
and
raised
her
head
somewhat
then
i
poured
a
little
of
the
brandy
between
her
lips
after
a
while
she
shivered
slightly
a
little
later
she
gave
several
gasps
and
opened
her
eyes
in
a
dreamy
unrealizing
way
she
looked
at
me
then
her
eyes
closed
slowly
and
i
gave
her
a
little
more
of
the
brandy
for
perhaps
a
minute
longer
she
lay
silent
breathing
quickly
all
at
once
her
eyes
opened
again
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
looked
that
the
pupils
were
dilated
as
though
fear
had
come
with
returning
consciousness
then
with
a
movement
so
unexpected
that
i
started
backward
she
sat
up
noticing
that
she
seemed
giddy
i
put
out
my
hand
to
steady
her
at
that
she
gave
a
loud
scream
and
scrambling
to
her
feet
ran
from
the
room
for
a
moment
i
stayed
there
kneeling
and
holding
the
brandy
flask
i
was
utterly
puzzled
and
astonished
could
she
be
afraid
of
me
but
no
why
should
she
i
could
only
conclude
that
her
nerves
were
badly
shaken
and
that
she
was
temporarily
unhinged
upstairs
i
heard
a
door
bang
loudly
and
i
knew
that
she
had
taken
refuge
in
her
room
i
put
the
flask
down
on
the
table
my
attention
was
distracted
by
a
noise
in
the
direction
of
the
back
door
i
went
toward
it
and
listened
it
appeared
to
be
shaken
as
though
some
of
the
creatures
struggled
with
it
silently
but
it
was
far
too
strongly
constructed
and
hung
to
be
easily
moved
out
in
the
gardens
rose
a
continuous
sound
it
might
have
been
mistaken
by
a
casual
listener
for
the
grunting
and
squealing
of
a
herd
of
pigs
but
as
i
stood
there
it
came
to
me
that
there
was
sense
and
meaning
to
all
those
swinish
noises
gradually
i
seemed
able
to
trace
a
semblance
in
it
to
human
speech
glutinous
and
sticky
as
though
each
articulation
were
made
with
difficulty
yet
nevertheless
i
was
becoming
convinced
that
it
was
no
mere
medley
of
sounds
but
a
rapid
interchange
of
ideas
by
this
time
it
had
grown
quite
dark
in
the
passages
and
from
these
came
all
the
varied
cries
and
groans
of
which
an
old
house
is
so
full
after
nightfall
it
is
no
doubt
because
things
are
then
quieter
and
one
has
more
leisure
to
hear
also
there
may
be
something
in
the
theory
that
the
sudden
change
of
temperature
at
sundown
affects
the
structure
of
the
house
somewhat
causing
it
to
contract
and
settle
as
it
were
for
the
night
however
this
is
as
may
be
but
on
that
night
in
particular
i
would
gladly
have
been
quit
of
so
many
eerie
noises
it
seemed
to
me
that
each
crack
and
creak
was
the
coming
of
one
of
those
things
along
the
dark
corridors
though
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
this
could
not
be
for
i
had
seen
myself
that
all
the
doors
were
secure
gradually
however
these
sounds
grew
on
my
nerves
to
such
an
extent
that
were
it
only
to
punish
my
cowardice
i
felt
i
must
make
the
of
the
basement
again
and
if
anything
were
there
face
it
and
then
i
would
go
up
to
my
study
for
i
knew
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
with
the
house
surrounded
by
creatures
half
beasts
half
something
else
and
entirely
unholy
taking
the
kitchen
lamp
down
from
its
hook
i
made
my
way
from
cellar
to
cellar
and
room
to
room
through
pantry
and
along
passages
and
into
the
little
blind
alleys
and
hidden
nooks
that
form
the
basement
of
the
old
house
then
when
i
knew
i
had
been
in
every
corner
and
cranny
large
enough
to
conceal
aught
of
any
size
i
made
my
way
to
the
stairs
with
my
foot
on
the
first
step
i
paused
it
seemed
to
me
i
heard
a
movement
apparently
from
the
buttery
which
is
to
the
left
of
the
staircase
it
had
been
one
of
the
first
places
i
searched
and
yet
i
felt
certain
my
ears
had
not
deceived
me
my
nerves
were
strung
now
and
with
hardly
any
hesitation
i
stepped
up
to
the
door
holding
the
lamp
above
my
head
in
a
glance
i
saw
that
the
place
was
empty
save
for
the
heavy
stone
slabs
supported
by
brick
pillars
and
i
was
about
to
leave
it
convinced
that
i
had
been
mistaken
when
in
turning
my
light
was
flashed
back
from
two
bright
spots
outside
the
window
and
high
up
for
a
few
moments
i
stood
there
staring
then
they
moved
revolving
slowly
and
throwing
out
alternate
scintillations
of
green
and
red
at
least
so
it
appeared
to
me
i
knew
then
that
they
were
eyes
slowly
i
traced
the
shadowy
outline
of
one
of
the
things
it
appeared
to
be
holding
on
to
the
bars
of
the
window
and
its
attitude
suggested
climbing
i
went
nearer
to
the
window
and
held
the
light
higher
there
was
no
need
to
be
afraid
of
the
creature
the
bars
were
strong
and
there
was
little
danger
of
its
being
able
to
move
them
and
then
suddenly
in
spite
of
the
knowledge
that
the
brute
could
not
reach
to
harm
me
i
had
a
return
of
the
horrible
sensation
of
fear
that
had
assailed
me
on
that
night
a
week
previously
it
was
the
same
feeling
of
helpless
shuddering
fright
i
realized
dimly
that
the
creature
eyes
were
looking
into
mine
with
a
steady
compelling
stare
i
tried
to
turn
away
but
could
not
i
seemed
now
to
see
the
window
through
a
mist
then
i
thought
other
eyes
came
and
peered
and
yet
others
until
a
whole
galaxy
of
malignant
staring
orbs
seemed
to
hold
me
in
thrall
my
head
began
to
swim
and
throb
violently
then
i
was
aware
of
a
feeling
of
acute
physical
pain
in
my
left
hand
it
grew
more
severe
and
forced
literally
forced
my
attention
with
a
tremendous
effort
i
glanced
down
and
with
that
the
spell
that
had
held
me
was
broken
i
realized
then
that
i
had
in
my
agitation
unconsciously
caught
hold
of
the
hot
and
burnt
my
hand
badly
i
looked
up
to
the
window
again
the
misty
appearance
had
gone
and
now
i
saw
that
it
was
crowded
with
dozens
of
bestial
faces
with
a
sudden
access
of
rage
i
raised
the
lamp
and
hurled
it
full
at
the
window
it
struck
the
glass
smashing
a
pane
and
passed
between
two
of
the
bars
out
into
the
garden
scattering
burning
oil
as
it
went
i
heard
several
loud
cries
of
pain
and
as
my
sight
became
accustomed
to
the
dark
i
discovered
that
the
creatures
had
left
the
window
pulling
myself
together
i
groped
for
the
door
and
having
found
it
made
my
way
upstairs
stumbling
at
each
step
i
felt
dazed
as
though
i
had
received
a
blow
on
the
head
at
the
same
time
my
hand
smarted
badly
and
i
was
full
of
a
nervous
dull
rage
against
those
things
reaching
my
study
i
lit
the
candles
as
they
burnt
up
their
rays
were
reflected
from
the
rack
of
firearms
on
the
sidewall
at
the
sight
i
remembered
that
i
had
there
a
power
which
as
i
had
proved
earlier
seemed
as
fatal
to
those
monsters
as
to
more
ordinary
animals
and
i
determined
i
would
take
the
offensive
first
of
all
i
bound
up
my
hand
for
the
pain
was
fast
becoming
intolerable
after
that
it
seemed
easier
and
i
crossed
the
room
to
the
rifle
stand
there
i
selected
a
heavy
rifle
an
old
and
tried
weapon
and
having
procured
ammunition
i
made
my
way
up
into
one
of
the
small
towers
with
which
the
house
is
crowned
from
there
i
found
that
i
could
see
nothing
the
gardens
presented
a
dim
blur
of
shadows
a
little
blacker
perhaps
where
the
trees
stood
that
was
all
and
i
knew
that
it
was
useless
to
shoot
down
into
all
that
darkness
the
only
thing
to
be
done
was
to
wait
for
the
moon
to
rise
then
i
might
be
able
to
do
a
little
execution
in
the
meantime
i
sat
still
and
kept
my
ears
open
the
gardens
were
comparatively
quiet
now
and
only
an
occasional
grunt
or
squeal
came
up
to
me
i
did
not
like
this
silence
it
made
me
wonder
on
what
devilry
the
creatures
were
bent
twice
i
left
the
tower
and
took
a
walk
through
the
house
but
everything
was
silent
once
i
heard
a
noise
from
the
direction
of
the
pit
as
though
more
earth
had
fallen
following
this
and
lasting
for
some
fifteen
minutes
there
was
a
commotion
among
the
denizens
of
the
gardens
this
died
away
and
after
that
all
was
again
quiet
about
an
hour
later
the
moon
light
showed
above
the
distant
horizon
from
where
i
sat
i
could
see
it
over
the
trees
but
it
was
not
until
it
rose
clear
of
them
that
i
could
make
out
any
of
the
details
in
the
gardens
below
even
then
i
could
see
none
of
the
brutes
until
happening
to
crane
forward
i
saw
several
of
them
lying
prone
up
against
the
wall
of
the
house
what
they
were
doing
i
could
not
make
out
it
was
however
a
chance
too
good
to
be
ignored
and
taking
aim
i
fired
at
the
one
directly
beneath
there
was
a
shrill
scream
and
as
the
smoke
cleared
away
i
saw
that
it
had
turned
on
its
back
and
was
writhing
feebly
then
it
was
quiet
the
others
had
disappeared
immediately
after
this
i
heard
a
loud
squeal
in
the
direction
of
the
pit
it
was
answered
a
hundred
times
from
every
part
of
the
garden
this
gave
me
some
notion
of
the
number
of
the
creatures
and
i
began
to
feel
that
the
whole
affair
was
becoming
even
more
serious
than
i
had
imagined
as
i
sat
there
silent
and
watchful
the
thought
came
to
me
why
was
all
this
what
were
these
things
what
did
it
mean
then
my
thoughts
flew
back
to
that
vision
though
even
now
i
doubt
whether
it
was
a
vision
of
the
plain
of
silence
what
did
that
mean
i
wondered
and
that
thing
in
the
arena
ugh
lastly
i
thought
of
the
house
i
had
seen
in
that
place
that
house
so
like
this
in
every
detail
of
external
structure
that
it
might
have
been
modeled
from
it
or
this
from
that
i
had
never
thought
of
that
at
this
moment
there
came
another
long
squeal
from
the
pit
followed
a
second
later
by
a
couple
of
shorter
ones
at
once
the
garden
was
filled
with
answering
cries
i
stood
up
quickly
and
looked
over
the
parapet
in
the
moonlight
it
seemed
as
though
the
shrubberies
were
alive
they
tossed
hither
and
thither
as
though
shaken
by
a
strong
irregular
wind
while
a
continuous
rustling
and
a
noise
of
scampering
feet
rose
up
to
me
several
times
i
saw
the
moonlight
gleam
on
running
white
figures
among
the
bushes
and
twice
i
fired
the
second
time
my
shot
was
answered
by
a
short
squeal
of
pain
a
minute
later
the
gardens
lay
silent
from
the
pit
came
a
deep
hoarse
babel
of
at
times
angry
cries
smote
the
air
and
they
would
be
answered
by
multitudinous
gruntings
it
occurred
to
me
that
they
were
holding
some
kind
of
a
council
perhaps
to
discuss
the
problem
of
entering
the
house
also
i
thought
that
they
seemed
much
enraged
probably
by
my
successful
shots
it
occurred
to
me
that
now
would
be
a
good
time
to
make
a
final
survey
of
our
defenses
this
i
proceeded
to
do
at
once
visiting
the
whole
of
the
basement
again
and
examining
each
of
the
doors
luckily
they
are
all
like
the
back
one
built
of
solid
oak
then
i
went
upstairs
to
the
study
i
was
more
anxious
about
this
door
it
is
palpably
of
a
more
modern
make
than
the
others
and
though
a
stout
piece
of
work
it
has
little
of
their
ponderous
strength
i
must
explain
here
that
there
is
a
small
raised
lawn
on
this
side
of
the
house
upon
which
this
door
opens
the
windows
of
the
study
being
barred
on
this
account
all
the
other
entrances
excepting
the
great
gateway
which
is
never
opened
are
in
the
lower
storey
the
attack
i
spent
some
time
puzzling
how
to
strengthen
the
study
door
finally
i
went
down
to
the
kitchen
and
with
some
trouble
brought
up
several
heavy
pieces
of
timber
these
i
wedged
up
slantwise
against
it
from
the
floor
nailing
them
top
and
bottom
for
i
worked
hard
and
at
last
got
it
shored
to
my
mind
then
feeling
easier
i
resumed
my
coat
which
i
had
laid
aside
and
proceeded
to
attend
to
one
or
two
matters
before
returning
to
the
tower
it
was
whilst
thus
employed
that
i
heard
a
fumbling
at
the
door
and
the
latch
was
tried
keeping
silence
i
waited
soon
i
heard
several
of
the
creatures
outside
they
were
grunting
to
one
another
softly
then
for
a
minute
there
was
quietness
suddenly
there
sounded
a
quick
low
grunt
and
the
door
creaked
under
a
tremendous
pressure
it
would
have
burst
inward
but
for
the
supports
i
had
placed
the
strain
ceased
as
quickly
as
it
had
begun
and
there
was
more
talk
presently
one
of
the
things
squealed
softly
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
others
approaching
there
was
a
short
confabulation
then
again
silence
and
i
realized
that
they
had
called
several
more
to
assist
feeling
that
now
was
the
supreme
moment
i
stood
ready
with
my
rifle
presented
if
the
door
gave
i
would
at
least
slay
as
many
as
possible
again
came
the
low
signal
and
once
more
the
door
cracked
under
a
huge
force
for
a
minute
perhaps
the
pressure
was
kept
up
and
i
waited
nervously
expecting
each
moment
to
see
the
door
come
down
with
a
crash
but
no
the
struts
held
and
the
attempt
proved
abortive
then
followed
more
of
their
horrible
grunting
talk
and
whilst
it
lasted
i
thought
i
distinguished
the
noise
of
fresh
arrivals
after
a
long
discussion
during
which
the
door
was
several
times
shaken
they
became
quiet
once
more
and
i
knew
that
they
were
going
to
make
a
third
attempt
to
break
it
down
i
was
almost
in
despair
the
props
had
been
severely
tried
in
the
two
previous
attacks
and
i
was
sorely
afraid
that
this
would
prove
too
much
for
them
at
that
moment
like
an
inspiration
a
thought
flashed
into
my
troubled
brain
instantly
for
it
was
no
time
to
hesitate
i
ran
from
the
room
and
up
stair
after
stair
this
time
it
was
not
to
one
of
the
towers
that
i
went
but
out
on
to
the
flat
leaded
roof
itself
once
there
i
raced
across
to
the
parapet
that
walls
it
and
looked
down
as
i
did
so
i
heard
the
short
grunted
signal
and
even
up
there
caught
the
crying
of
the
door
under
the
assault
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
and
leaning
over
i
aimed
quickly
and
fired
the
report
rang
sharply
and
almost
blending
with
it
came
the
loud
splud
of
the
bullet
striking
its
mark
from
below
rose
a
shrill
wail
and
the
door
ceased
its
groaning
then
as
i
took
my
weight
from
off
the
parapet
a
huge
piece
of
the
stone
coping
slid
from
under
me
and
fell
with
a
crash
among
the
disorganized
throng
beneath
several
horrible
shrieks
quavered
through
the
night
air
and
then
i
heard
a
sound
of
scampering
feet
cautiously
i
looked
over
in
the
moonlight
i
could
see
the
great
copingstone
lying
right
across
the
threshold
of
the
door
i
thought
i
saw
something
under
it
several
things
white
but
i
could
not
be
sure
and
so
a
few
minutes
passed
as
i
stared
i
saw
something
come
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
house
it
was
one
of
the
things
it
went
up
to
the
stone
silently
and
bent
down
i
was
unable
to
see
what
it
did
in
a
minute
it
stood
up
it
had
something
in
its
talons
which
it
put
to
its
mouth
and
tore
at
for
the
moment
i
did
not
realize
then
slowly
i
comprehended
the
thing
was
stooping
again
it
was
horrible
i
started
to
load
my
rifle
when
i
looked
again
the
monster
was
tugging
at
the
stone
moving
it
to
one
side
i
leant
the
rifle
on
the
coping
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
brute
collapsed
on
its
face
and
kicked
slightly
simultaneously
almost
with
the
report
i
heard
another
sound
that
of
breaking
glass
waiting
only
to
recharge
my
weapon
i
ran
from
the
roof
and
down
the
first
two
flights
of
stairs
here
i
paused
to
listen
as
i
did
so
there
came
another
tinkle
of
falling
glass
it
appeared
to
come
from
the
floor
below
excitedly
i
sprang
down
the
steps
and
guided
by
the
rattle
of
the
reached
the
door
of
one
of
the
empty
bedrooms
at
the
back
of
the
house
i
thrust
it
open
the
room
was
but
dimly
illuminated
by
the
moonlight
most
of
the
light
being
blotted
out
by
moving
figures
at
the
window
even
as
i
stood
one
crawled
through
into
the
room
leveling
my
weapon
i
fired
at
it
filling
the
room
with
a
deafening
bang
when
the
smoke
cleared
i
saw
that
the
room
was
empty
and
the
window
free
the
room
was
much
lighter
the
night
air
blew
in
coldly
through
the
shattered
panes
down
below
in
the
night
i
could
hear
a
soft
moaning
and
a
confused
murmur
of
stepping
to
one
side
of
the
window
i
reloaded
and
then
stood
there
waiting
presently
i
heard
a
scuffling
noise
from
where
i
stood
in
the
shadow
i
could
see
without
being
seen
nearer
came
the
sounds
and
then
i
saw
something
come
up
above
the
sill
and
clutch
at
the
broken
it
caught
a
piece
of
the
woodwork
and
now
i
could
make
out
that
it
was
a
hand
and
arm
a
moment
later
the
face
of
one
of
the
rose
into
view
then
before
i
could
use
my
rifle
or
do
anything
there
came
a
sharp
crack
and
the
gave
way
under
the
weight
of
the
thing
next
instant
a
squashing
thud
and
a
loud
outcry
told
me
that
it
had
fallen
to
the
ground
with
a
savage
hope
that
it
had
been
killed
i
went
to
the
window
the
moon
had
gone
behind
a
cloud
so
that
i
could
see
nothing
though
a
steady
hum
of
jabbering
just
beneath
where
i
stood
indicated
that
there
were
several
more
of
the
brutes
close
at
hand
as
i
stood
there
looking
down
i
marveled
how
it
had
been
possible
for
the
creatures
to
climb
so
far
for
the
wall
is
comparatively
smooth
while
the
distance
to
the
ground
must
be
at
least
eighty
feet
all
at
once
as
i
bent
peering
i
saw
something
indistinctly
that
cut
the
grey
shadow
of
the
with
a
black
line
it
passed
the
window
to
the
left
at
a
distance
of
about
two
feet
then
i
remembered
that
it
was
a
that
had
been
put
there
some
years
ago
to
carry
off
the
rainwater
i
had
forgotten
about
it
i
could
see
now
how
the
creatures
had
managed
to
reach
the
window
even
as
the
solution
came
to
me
i
heard
a
faint
slithering
scratching
noise
and
knew
that
another
of
the
brutes
was
coming
i
waited
some
odd
moments
then
leant
out
of
the
window
and
felt
the
pipe
to
my
delight
i
found
that
it
was
quite
loose
and
i
managed
using
the
as
a
crowbar
to
lever
it
out
from
the
wall
i
worked
quickly
then
taking
hold
with
both
bands
i
wrenched
the
whole
concern
away
and
hurled
it
down
with
the
thing
still
clinging
to
it
into
the
garden
for
a
few
minutes
longer
i
waited
there
listening
but
after
the
first
general
outcry
i
heard
nothing
i
knew
now
that
there
was
no
more
reason
to
fear
an
attack
from
this
quarter
i
had
removed
the
only
means
of
reaching
the
window
and
as
none
of
the
other
windows
had
any
adjacent
water
pipes
to
tempt
the
climbing
powers
of
the
monsters
i
began
to
feel
more
confident
of
escaping
their
clutches
leaving
the
room
i
made
my
way
down
to
the
study
i
was
anxious
to
see
how
the
door
had
withstood
the
test
of
that
last
assault
entering
i
lit
two
of
the
candles
and
then
turned
to
the
door
one
of
the
large
props
had
been
displaced
and
on
that
side
the
door
had
been
forced
inward
some
six
inches
it
was
providential
that
i
had
managed
to
drive
the
brutes
away
just
when
i
did
and
that
copingstone
i
wondered
vaguely
how
i
had
managed
to
dislodge
it
i
had
not
noticed
it
loose
as
i
took
my
shot
and
then
as
i
stood
up
it
had
slipped
away
from
beneath
me
i
felt
that
i
owed
the
dismissal
of
the
attacking
force
more
to
its
timely
fall
than
to
my
rifle
then
the
thought
came
that
i
had
better
seize
this
chance
to
shore
up
the
door
again
it
was
evident
that
the
creatures
had
not
returned
since
the
fall
of
the
copingstone
but
who
was
to
say
how
long
they
would
keep
away
there
and
then
i
at
repairing
the
door
working
hard
and
anxiously
first
i
went
down
to
the
basement
and
rummaging
found
several
pieces
of
heavy
oak
planking
with
these
i
returned
to
the
study
and
having
removed
the
props
placed
the
planks
up
against
the
door
then
i
nailed
the
heads
of
the
struts
to
these
and
driving
them
well
home
at
the
bottoms
nailed
them
again
there
thus
i
made
the
door
stronger
than
ever
for
now
it
was
solid
with
the
backing
of
boards
and
would
i
felt
convinced
stand
a
heavier
pressure
than
hitherto
without
giving
way
after
that
i
lit
the
lamp
which
i
had
brought
from
the
kitchen
and
went
down
to
have
a
look
at
the
lower
windows
now
that
i
had
seen
an
instance
of
the
strength
the
creatures
possessed
i
felt
considerable
anxiety
about
the
windows
on
the
ground
floor
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
were
so
strongly
barred
i
went
first
to
the
buttery
having
a
vivid
remembrance
of
my
late
adventure
there
the
place
was
chilly
and
the
wind
soughing
in
through
the
broken
glass
produced
an
eerie
note
apart
from
the
general
air
of
dismalness
the
place
was
as
i
had
left
it
the
night
before
going
up
to
the
window
i
examined
the
bars
closely
noting
as
i
did
so
their
comfortable
thickness
still
as
i
looked
more
intently
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
middle
bar
was
bent
slightly
from
the
straight
yet
it
was
but
trifling
and
it
might
have
been
so
for
years
i
had
never
before
noticed
them
particularly
i
put
my
hand
through
the
broken
window
and
shook
the
bar
it
was
as
firm
as
a
rock
perhaps
the
creatures
had
tried
to
it
and
finding
it
beyond
their
power
ceased
from
the
effort
after
that
i
went
to
each
of
the
windows
in
turn
examining
them
with
careful
attention
but
nowhere
else
could
i
trace
anything
to
show
that
there
had
been
any
tampering
having
finished
my
survey
i
went
back
to
the
study
and
poured
myself
out
a
little
brandy
then
to
the
tower
to
watch
after
the
attack
it
was
now
about
three
and
presently
the
eastern
sky
began
to
pale
with
the
coming
of
dawn
gradually
the
day
came
and
by
its
light
i
scanned
the
gardens
earnestly
but
nowhere
could
i
see
any
signs
of
the
brutes
i
leant
over
and
glanced
down
to
the
foot
of
the
wall
to
see
whether
the
body
of
the
thing
i
had
shot
the
night
before
was
still
there
it
was
gone
i
supposed
that
others
of
the
monsters
had
removed
it
during
the
night
then
i
went
down
on
to
the
roof
and
crossed
over
to
the
gap
from
which
the
coping
stone
had
fallen
reaching
it
i
looked
over
yes
there
was
the
stone
as
i
had
seen
it
last
but
there
was
no
appearance
of
anything
beneath
it
nor
could
i
see
the
creatures
i
had
killed
after
its
fall
evidently
they
also
had
been
taken
away
i
turned
and
went
down
to
my
study
there
i
sat
down
wearily
i
was
thoroughly
tired
it
was
quite
light
now
though
the
sun
rays
were
not
as
yet
perceptibly
hot
a
clock
chimed
the
hour
of
four
i
awoke
with
a
start
and
looked
hurriedly
the
clock
in
the
corner
indicated
that
it
was
three
it
was
already
afternoon
i
must
have
slept
for
nearly
eleven
hours
with
a
jerky
movement
i
sat
forward
in
the
chair
and
listened
the
house
was
perfectly
silent
slowly
i
stood
up
and
yawned
i
felt
desperately
tired
still
and
sat
down
again
wondering
what
it
was
that
had
waked
me
it
must
have
been
the
clock
striking
i
concluded
presently
and
was
commencing
to
doze
off
when
a
sudden
noise
brought
me
back
once
more
to
life
it
was
the
sound
of
a
step
as
of
a
person
moving
cautiously
down
the
corridor
toward
my
study
in
an
instant
i
was
on
my
feet
and
grasping
my
rifle
noiselessly
i
waited
had
the
creatures
broken
in
whilst
i
slept
even
as
i
questioned
the
steps
reached
my
door
halted
momentarily
and
then
continued
down
the
passage
silently
i
tiptoed
to
the
doorway
and
peeped
out
then
i
experienced
such
a
feeling
of
relief
as
must
a
reprieved
criminal
it
was
my
sister
she
was
going
toward
the
stairs
i
stepped
into
the
hall
and
was
about
to
call
to
her
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
very
queer
she
should
have
crept
past
my
door
in
that
stealthy
manner
i
was
puzzled
and
for
one
brief
moment
the
thought
occupied
my
mind
that
it
was
not
she
but
some
fresh
mystery
of
the
house
then
as
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
old
petticoat
the
thought
passed
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
and
i
half
laughed
there
could
be
no
mistaking
that
ancient
garment
yet
i
wondered
what
she
was
doing
and
remembering
her
condition
of
mind
on
the
previous
day
i
felt
that
it
might
be
best
to
follow
quietly
taking
care
not
to
alarm
her
and
see
what
she
was
going
to
do
if
she
behaved
rationally
well
and
good
if
not
i
should
have
to
take
steps
to
restrain
her
i
could
run
no
unnecessary
risks
under
the
danger
that
threatened
us
quickly
i
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
paused
a
moment
then
i
heard
a
sound
that
sent
me
leaping
down
at
a
mad
rate
it
was
the
rattle
of
bolts
being
unshot
that
foolish
sister
of
mine
was
actually
unbarring
the
back
door
just
as
her
hand
was
on
the
last
bolt
i
reached
her
she
had
not
seen
me
and
the
first
thing
she
knew
i
had
hold
of
her
arm
she
glanced
up
quickly
like
a
frightened
animal
and
screamed
aloud
mary
i
said
sternly
the
meaning
of
this
nonsense
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
do
understand
the
danger
that
you
try
to
throw
our
two
lives
away
in
this
fashion
to
this
she
replied
nothing
only
trembled
violently
gasping
and
sobbing
as
though
in
the
last
extremity
of
fear
through
some
minutes
i
reasoned
with
her
pointing
out
the
need
for
caution
and
asking
her
to
be
brave
there
was
little
to
be
afraid
of
now
i
explained
and
i
tried
to
believe
that
i
spoke
the
truth
but
she
must
be
sensible
and
not
attempt
to
leave
the
house
for
a
few
days
at
last
i
ceased
in
despair
it
was
no
use
talking
to
her
she
was
obviously
not
quite
herself
for
the
time
being
finally
i
told
her
she
had
better
go
to
her
room
if
she
could
not
behave
rationally
still
she
took
not
any
notice
so
without
more
ado
i
picked
her
up
in
my
arms
and
carried
her
there
at
first
she
screamed
wildly
but
had
relapsed
into
silent
trembling
by
the
time
i
reached
the
stairs
arriving
at
her
room
i
laid
her
upon
the
bed
she
lay
there
quietly
enough
neither
speaking
nor
sobbing
just
shaking
in
a
very
ague
of
fear
i
took
a
rug
from
a
chair
near
by
and
spread
it
over
her
i
could
do
nothing
more
for
her
and
so
crossed
to
where
pepper
lay
in
a
big
basket
my
sister
had
taken
charge
of
him
since
his
wound
to
nurse
him
for
it
had
proved
more
severe
than
i
had
thought
and
i
was
pleased
to
note
that
in
spite
of
her
state
of
mind
she
had
looked
after
the
old
dog
carefully
stooping
i
spoke
to
him
and
in
reply
he
licked
my
hand
feebly
he
was
too
ill
to
do
more
then
going
to
the
bed
i
bent
over
my
sister
and
asked
her
how
she
felt
but
she
only
shook
the
more
and
much
as
it
pained
me
i
had
to
admit
that
my
presence
seemed
to
make
her
worse
and
so
i
left
her
locking
the
door
and
pocketing
the
key
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
course
to
take
the
rest
of
the
day
i
spent
between
the
tower
and
my
study
for
food
i
brought
up
a
loaf
from
the
pantry
and
on
this
and
some
claret
i
lived
for
that
day
what
a
long
weary
day
it
was
if
only
i
could
have
gone
out
into
the
gardens
as
is
my
wont
i
should
have
been
content
enough
but
to
be
cooped
in
this
silent
house
with
no
companion
save
a
mad
woman
and
a
sick
dog
was
enough
to
prey
upon
the
nerves
of
the
hardiest
and
out
in
the
tangled
shrubberies
that
surrounded
the
house
lurked
for
all
i
could
tell
those
infernal
waiting
their
chance
was
ever
a
man
in
such
straits
once
in
the
afternoon
and
again
later
i
went
to
visit
my
sister
the
second
time
i
found
her
tending
pepper
but
at
my
approach
she
slid
over
unobtrusively
to
the
far
corner
with
a
gesture
that
saddened
me
beyond
belief
poor
girl
her
fear
cut
me
intolerably
and
i
would
not
intrude
on
her
unnecessarily
she
would
be
better
i
trusted
in
a
few
days
meanwhile
i
could
do
nothing
and
i
judged
it
still
needful
hard
as
it
seemed
to
keep
her
confined
to
her
room
one
thing
there
was
that
i
took
for
encouragement
she
had
eaten
some
of
the
food
i
had
taken
to
her
on
my
first
visit
and
so
the
day
passed
as
the
evening
drew
on
the
air
grew
chilly
and
i
began
to
make
preparations
for
passing
a
second
night
in
the
tower
taking
up
two
additional
rifles
and
a
heavy
ulster
the
rifles
i
loaded
and
laid
alongside
my
other
as
i
intended
to
make
things
warm
for
any
of
the
creatures
who
might
show
during
the
night
i
had
plenty
of
ammunition
and
i
thought
to
give
the
brutes
such
a
lesson
as
should
show
them
the
uselessness
of
attempting
to
force
an
entrance
after
that
i
made
the
of
the
house
again
paying
particular
attention
to
the
props
that
supported
the
study
door
then
feeling
that
i
had
done
all
that
lay
in
my
power
to
insure
our
safety
i
returned
to
the
tower
calling
in
on
my
sister
and
pepper
for
a
final
visit
on
the
way
pepper
was
asleep
but
woke
as
i
entered
and
wagged
his
tail
in
recognition
i
thought
he
seemed
slightly
better
my
sister
was
lying
on
the
bed
though
whether
asleep
or
not
i
was
unable
to
tell
and
thus
i
left
them
reaching
the
tower
i
made
myself
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
would
permit
and
settled
down
to
watch
through
the
night
gradually
darkness
fell
and
soon
the
details
of
the
gardens
were
merged
into
shadows
during
the
first
few
hours
i
sat
alert
listening
for
any
sound
that
might
help
to
tell
me
if
anything
were
stirring
down
below
it
was
far
too
dark
for
my
eyes
to
be
of
much
use
slowly
the
hours
passed
without
anything
unusual
happening
and
the
moon
rose
showing
the
gardens
apparently
empty
and
silent
and
so
through
the
night
without
disturbance
or
sound
toward
morning
i
began
to
grow
stiff
and
cold
with
my
long
vigil
also
i
was
getting
very
uneasy
concerning
the
continued
quietness
on
the
part
of
the
creatures
i
mistrusted
it
and
would
sooner
far
have
had
them
attack
the
house
openly
then
at
least
i
should
have
known
my
danger
and
been
able
to
meet
it
but
to
wait
like
this
through
a
whole
night
picturing
all
kinds
of
unknown
devilment
was
to
jeopardize
one
sanity
once
or
twice
the
thought
came
to
me
that
perhaps
they
had
gone
but
in
my
heart
i
found
it
impossible
to
believe
that
it
was
so
in
the
cellars
at
last
what
with
being
tired
and
cold
and
the
uneasiness
that
possessed
me
i
resolved
to
take
a
walk
through
the
house
first
calling
in
at
the
study
for
a
glass
of
brandy
to
warm
me
this
i
did
and
while
there
i
examined
the
door
carefully
but
found
all
as
i
had
left
it
the
night
before
the
day
was
just
breaking
as
i
left
the
tower
though
it
was
still
too
dark
in
the
house
to
be
able
to
see
without
a
light
and
i
took
one
of
the
study
candles
with
me
on
my
by
the
time
i
had
finished
the
ground
floor
the
daylight
was
creeping
in
wanly
through
the
barred
windows
my
search
had
shown
me
nothing
fresh
everything
appeared
to
be
in
order
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
extinguishing
my
candle
when
the
thought
suggested
itself
to
me
to
have
another
glance
the
cellars
i
had
not
if
i
remember
rightly
been
into
them
since
my
hasty
search
on
the
evening
of
the
attack
for
perhaps
the
half
of
a
minute
i
hesitated
i
would
have
been
very
willing
to
forego
the
task
as
indeed
i
am
inclined
to
think
any
man
well
might
for
of
all
the
great
rooms
in
this
house
the
cellars
are
the
hugest
and
weirdest
great
gloomy
caverns
of
places
unlit
by
any
ray
of
daylight
yet
i
would
not
shirk
the
work
i
felt
that
to
do
so
would
smack
of
sheer
cowardice
besides
as
i
reassured
myself
the
cellars
were
really
the
most
unlikely
places
in
which
to
come
across
anything
dangerous
considering
that
they
can
be
entered
only
through
a
heavy
oaken
door
the
key
of
which
i
carry
always
on
my
person
it
is
in
the
smallest
of
these
places
that
i
keep
my
wine
a
gloomy
hole
close
to
the
foot
of
the
cellar
stairs
and
beyond
which
i
have
seldom
proceeded
indeed
save
for
the
rummage
already
mentioned
i
doubt
whether
i
had
ever
before
been
right
through
the
cellars
as
i
unlocked
the
great
door
at
the
top
of
the
steps
i
paused
nervously
a
moment
at
the
strange
desolate
smell
that
assailed
my
nostrils
then
throwing
the
barrel
of
my
weapon
forward
i
descended
slowly
into
the
darkness
of
the
underground
regions
reaching
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
i
stood
for
a
minute
and
listened
all
was
silent
save
for
a
faint
drip
drip
of
water
falling
somewhere
to
my
left
as
i
stood
i
noticed
how
quietly
the
candle
burnt
never
a
flicker
nor
flare
so
utterly
windless
was
the
place
quietly
i
moved
from
cellar
to
cellar
i
had
but
a
very
dim
memory
of
their
arrangement
the
impressions
left
by
my
first
search
were
blurred
i
had
recollections
of
a
succession
of
great
cellars
and
of
one
greater
than
the
rest
the
roof
of
which
was
upheld
by
pillars
beyond
that
my
mind
was
hazy
and
predominated
by
a
sense
of
cold
and
darkness
and
shadows
now
however
it
was
different
for
although
nervous
i
was
sufficiently
collected
to
be
able
to
look
about
me
and
note
the
structure
and
size
of
the
different
vaults
i
entered
of
course
with
the
amount
of
light
given
by
my
candle
it
was
not
possible
to
examine
each
place
minutely
but
i
was
enabled
to
notice
as
i
went
along
that
the
walls
appeared
to
be
built
with
wonderful
precision
and
finish
while
here
and
there
an
occasional
massive
pillar
shot
up
to
support
the
vaulted
roof
thus
i
came
at
last
to
the
great
cellar
that
i
remembered
it
is
reached
through
a
huge
arched
entrance
on
which
i
observed
strange
fantastic
carvings
which
threw
queer
shadows
under
the
light
of
my
candle
as
i
stood
and
examined
these
thoughtfully
it
occurred
to
me
how
strange
it
was
that
i
should
be
so
little
acquainted
with
my
own
house
yet
this
may
be
easily
understood
when
one
realizes
the
size
of
this
ancient
pile
and
the
fact
that
only
my
old
sister
and
i
live
in
it
occupying
a
few
of
the
rooms
such
as
our
wants
decide
holding
the
light
high
i
passed
on
into
the
cellar
and
keeping
to
the
right
paced
slowly
up
until
i
reached
the
further
end
i
walked
quietly
and
looked
cautiously
about
as
i
went
but
so
far
as
the
light
showed
i
saw
nothing
unusual
at
the
top
i
turned
to
the
left
still
keeping
to
the
wall
and
so
continued
until
i
had
traversed
the
whole
of
the
vast
chamber
as
i
moved
along
i
noticed
that
the
floor
was
composed
of
solid
rock
in
places
covered
with
a
damp
mould
in
others
bare
or
almost
so
save
for
a
thin
coating
of
dust
i
had
halted
at
the
doorway
now
however
i
turned
and
made
my
way
up
the
center
of
the
place
passing
among
the
pillars
and
glancing
to
right
and
left
as
i
moved
about
halfway
up
the
cellar
i
stubbed
my
foot
against
something
that
gave
out
a
metallic
sound
stooping
quickly
i
held
the
candle
and
saw
that
the
object
i
had
kicked
was
a
large
metal
ring
bending
lower
i
cleared
the
dust
from
around
it
and
presently
discovered
that
it
was
attached
to
a
ponderous
trap
door
black
with
age
feeling
excited
and
wondering
to
where
it
could
lead
i
laid
my
gun
on
the
floor
and
sticking
the
candle
in
the
trigger
guard
took
the
ring
in
both
hands
and
pulled
the
trap
creaked
loudly
the
sound
echoing
vaguely
through
the
huge
place
and
opened
heavily
propping
the
edge
on
my
knee
i
reached
for
the
candle
and
held
it
in
the
opening
moving
it
to
right
and
left
but
could
see
nothing
i
was
puzzled
and
surprised
there
were
no
signs
of
steps
nor
even
the
appearance
of
there
ever
having
been
any
nothing
save
an
empty
blackness
i
might
have
been
looking
down
into
a
bottomless
sideless
well
then
even
as
i
stared
full
of
perplexity
i
seemed
to
hear
far
down
as
though
from
untold
depths
a
faint
whisper
of
sound
i
bent
my
head
quickly
more
into
the
opening
and
listened
intently
it
may
have
been
fancy
but
i
could
have
sworn
to
hearing
a
soft
titter
that
grew
into
a
hideous
chuckling
faint
and
distant
startled
i
leapt
backward
letting
the
trap
fall
with
a
hollow
clang
that
filled
the
place
with
echoes
even
then
i
seemed
to
hear
that
mocking
suggestive
laughter
but
this
i
knew
must
be
my
imagination
the
sound
i
had
heard
was
far
too
slight
to
penetrate
through
the
cumbrous
trap
for
a
full
minute
i
stood
there
quivering
glancing
nervously
behind
and
before
but
the
great
cellar
was
silent
as
a
grave
and
gradually
i
shook
off
the
frightened
sensation
with
a
calmer
mind
i
became
again
curious
to
know
into
what
that
trap
opened
but
could
not
then
summon
sufficient
courage
to
make
a
further
investigation
one
thing
i
felt
however
was
that
the
trap
ought
to
be
secured
this
i
accomplished
by
placing
upon
it
several
large
pieces
of
stone
which
i
had
noticed
in
my
tour
along
the
east
wall
then
after
a
final
scrutiny
of
the
rest
of
the
place
i
retraced
my
way
through
the
cellars
to
the
stairs
and
so
reached
the
daylight
with
an
infinite
feeling
of
relief
that
the
uncomfortable
task
was
accomplished
the
time
of
waiting
the
sun
was
now
warm
and
shining
brightly
forming
a
wondrous
contrast
to
the
dark
and
dismal
cellars
and
it
was
with
comparatively
light
feelings
that
i
made
my
way
up
to
the
tower
to
survey
the
gardens
there
i
found
everything
quiet
and
after
a
few
minutes
went
down
to
mary
room
here
having
knocked
and
received
a
reply
i
unlocked
the
door
my
sister
was
sitting
quietly
on
the
bed
as
though
waiting
she
seemed
quite
herself
again
and
made
no
attempt
to
move
away
as
i
approached
yet
i
observed
that
she
scanned
my
face
anxiously
as
though
in
doubt
and
but
half
assured
in
her
mind
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
from
me
to
my
questions
as
to
how
she
felt
she
replied
sanely
enough
that
she
was
hungry
and
would
like
to
go
down
to
prepare
breakfast
if
i
did
not
mind
for
a
minute
i
meditated
whether
it
would
be
safe
to
let
her
out
finally
i
told
her
she
might
go
on
condition
that
she
promised
not
to
attempt
to
leave
the
house
or
meddle
with
any
of
the
outer
doors
at
my
mention
of
the
doors
a
sudden
look
of
fright
crossed
her
face
but
she
said
nothing
save
to
give
the
required
promise
and
then
left
the
room
silently
crossing
the
floor
i
approached
pepper
he
had
waked
as
i
entered
but
beyond
a
slight
yelp
of
pleasure
and
a
soft
rapping
with
his
tail
had
kept
quiet
now
as
i
patted
him
he
made
an
attempt
to
stand
up
and
succeeded
only
to
fall
back
on
his
side
with
a
little
yowl
of
pain
i
spoke
to
him
and
bade
him
lie
still
i
was
greatly
delighted
with
his
improvement
and
also
with
the
natural
kindness
of
my
heart
in
taking
such
good
care
of
him
in
spite
of
her
condition
of
mind
after
a
while
i
left
him
and
went
downstairs
to
my
study
in
a
little
time
mary
appeared
carrying
a
tray
on
which
smoked
a
hot
breakfast
as
she
entered
the
room
i
saw
her
gaze
fasten
on
the
props
that
supported
the
study
door
her
lips
tightened
and
i
thought
she
paled
slightly
but
that
was
all
putting
the
tray
down
at
my
elbow
she
was
leaving
the
room
quietly
when
i
called
her
back
she
came
it
seemed
a
little
timidly
as
though
startled
and
i
noted
that
her
hand
clutched
at
her
apron
nervously
mary
i
said
up
things
look
brighter
i
seen
none
of
the
creatures
since
yesterday
morning
early
she
looked
at
me
in
a
curiously
puzzled
manner
as
though
not
comprehending
then
intelligence
swept
into
her
eyes
and
fear
but
she
said
nothing
beyond
an
unintelligible
murmur
of
acquiescence
after
that
i
kept
silence
it
was
evident
that
any
reference
to
the
was
more
than
her
shaken
nerves
could
bear
breakfast
over
i
went
up
to
the
tower
here
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
i
maintained
a
strict
watch
over
the
gardens
once
or
twice
i
went
down
to
the
basement
to
see
how
my
sister
was
getting
along
each
time
i
found
her
quiet
and
curiously
submissive
indeed
on
the
last
occasion
she
even
ventured
to
address
me
on
her
own
account
with
regard
to
some
household
matter
that
needed
attention
though
this
was
done
with
an
almost
extraordinary
timidity
i
hailed
it
with
happiness
as
being
the
first
word
voluntarily
spoken
since
the
critical
moment
when
i
had
caught
her
unbarring
the
back
door
to
go
out
among
those
waiting
brutes
i
wondered
whether
she
was
aware
of
her
attempt
and
how
near
a
thing
it
had
been
but
refrained
from
questioning
her
thinking
it
best
to
let
well
alone
that
night
i
slept
in
a
bed
the
first
time
for
two
nights
in
the
morning
i
rose
early
and
took
a
walk
through
the
house
all
was
as
it
should
be
and
i
went
up
to
the
tower
to
have
a
look
at
the
gardens
here
again
i
found
perfect
quietness
at
breakfast
when
i
met
mary
i
was
greatly
pleased
to
see
that
she
had
sufficiently
regained
command
over
herself
to
be
able
to
greet
me
in
a
perfectly
natural
manner
she
talked
sensibly
and
quietly
only
keeping
carefully
from
any
mention
of
the
past
couple
of
days
in
this
i
humored
her
to
the
extent
of
not
attempting
to
lead
the
conversation
in
that
direction
earlier
in
the
morning
i
had
been
to
see
pepper
he
was
mending
rapidly
and
bade
fair
to
be
on
his
legs
in
earnest
in
another
day
or
two
before
leaving
the
breakfast
table
i
made
some
reference
to
his
improvement
in
the
short
discussion
that
followed
i
was
surprised
to
gather
from
my
sister
remarks
that
she
was
still
under
the
impression
that
his
wound
had
been
given
by
the
wildcat
of
my
invention
it
made
me
feel
almost
ashamed
of
myself
for
deceiving
her
yet
the
lie
had
been
told
to
prevent
her
from
being
frightened
and
then
i
had
been
sure
that
she
must
have
known
the
truth
later
when
those
brutes
had
attacked
the
house
during
the
day
i
kept
on
the
alert
spending
much
of
my
time
as
on
the
previous
day
in
the
tower
but
not
a
sign
could
i
see
of
the
nor
hear
any
sound
several
times
the
thought
had
come
to
me
that
the
things
had
at
last
left
us
but
up
to
this
time
i
had
refused
to
entertain
the
idea
seriously
now
however
i
began
to
feel
that
there
was
reason
for
hope
it
would
soon
be
three
days
since
i
had
seen
any
of
the
things
but
still
i
intended
to
use
the
utmost
caution
for
all
that
i
could
tell
this
protracted
silence
might
be
a
ruse
to
tempt
me
from
the
house
perhaps
right
into
their
arms
the
thought
of
such
a
contingency
was
alone
sufficient
to
make
me
circumspect
so
it
was
that
the
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
days
went
by
quietly
without
my
making
any
attempt
to
leave
the
house
on
the
sixth
day
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
pepper
once
more
upon
his
feet
and
though
still
very
weak
he
managed
to
keep
me
company
during
the
whole
of
that
day
the
searching
of
the
gardens
how
slowly
the
time
went
and
never
a
thing
to
indicate
that
any
of
the
brutes
still
infested
the
gardens
it
was
on
the
ninth
day
that
finally
i
decided
to
run
the
risk
if
any
there
were
and
sally
out
with
this
purpose
in
view
i
loaded
one
of
the
shotguns
carefully
choosing
it
as
being
more
deadly
than
a
rifle
at
close
quarters
and
then
after
a
final
scrutiny
of
the
grounds
from
the
tower
i
called
pepper
to
follow
me
and
made
my
way
down
to
the
basement
at
the
door
i
must
confess
to
hesitating
a
moment
the
thought
of
what
might
be
awaiting
me
among
the
dark
shrubberies
was
by
no
means
calculated
to
encourage
my
resolution
it
was
but
a
second
though
and
then
i
had
drawn
the
bolts
and
was
standing
on
the
path
outside
the
door
pepper
followed
stopping
at
the
doorstep
to
sniff
suspiciously
and
carrying
his
nose
up
and
down
the
jambs
as
though
following
a
scent
then
suddenly
he
turned
sharply
and
started
to
run
here
and
there
in
semicircles
and
circles
all
around
the
door
finally
returning
to
the
threshold
here
he
began
again
to
nose
about
hitherto
i
had
stood
watching
the
dog
yet
all
the
time
with
half
my
gaze
on
the
wild
tangle
of
gardens
stretching
me
now
i
went
toward
him
and
bending
down
examined
the
surface
of
the
door
where
he
was
smelling
i
found
that
the
wood
was
covered
with
a
network
of
scratches
crossing
and
recrossing
one
another
in
inextricable
confusion
in
addition
to
this
i
noticed
that
the
doorposts
themselves
were
gnawed
in
places
beyond
these
i
could
find
nothing
and
so
standing
up
i
began
to
make
the
tour
of
the
house
wall
pepper
as
soon
as
i
walked
away
left
the
door
and
ran
ahead
still
nosing
and
sniffing
as
he
went
along
at
times
he
stopped
to
investigate
here
it
would
be
a
in
the
pathway
or
perhaps
a
powder
stained
wad
anon
it
might
be
a
piece
of
torn
sod
or
a
disturbed
patch
of
weedy
path
but
save
for
such
trifles
he
found
nothing
i
observed
him
critically
as
he
went
along
and
could
discover
nothing
of
uneasiness
in
his
demeanor
to
indicate
that
he
felt
the
nearness
of
any
of
the
creatures
by
this
i
was
assured
that
the
gardens
were
empty
at
least
for
the
present
of
those
hateful
things
pepper
could
not
be
easily
deceived
and
it
was
a
relief
to
feel
that
he
would
know
and
give
me
timely
warning
if
there
were
any
danger
reaching
the
place
where
i
had
shot
that
first
creature
i
stopped
and
made
a
careful
scrutiny
but
could
see
nothing
from
there
i
went
on
to
where
the
great
copingstone
had
fallen
it
lay
on
its
side
apparently
just
as
it
had
been
left
when
i
shot
the
brute
that
was
moving
it
a
couple
of
feet
to
the
right
of
the
nearer
end
was
a
great
dent
in
the
ground
showing
where
it
had
struck
the
other
end
was
still
within
the
indentation
half
in
and
half
out
going
nearer
i
looked
at
the
stone
more
closely
what
a
huge
piece
of
masonry
it
was
and
that
creature
had
moved
it
in
its
attempt
to
reach
what
lay
below
i
went
to
the
further
end
of
the
stone
here
i
found
that
it
was
possible
to
see
under
it
for
a
distance
of
nearly
a
couple
of
feet
still
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
stricken
creatures
and
i
felt
much
surprised
i
had
as
i
have
before
said
guessed
that
the
remains
had
been
removed
yet
i
could
not
conceive
that
it
had
been
done
so
thoroughly
as
not
to
leave
some
certain
sign
beneath
the
stone
indicative
of
their
fate
i
had
seen
several
of
the
brutes
struck
down
beneath
it
with
such
force
that
they
must
have
been
literally
driven
into
the
earth
and
now
not
a
vestige
of
them
was
to
be
seen
not
even
a
bloodstain
i
felt
more
puzzled
than
ever
as
i
turned
the
matter
over
in
my
mind
but
could
think
of
no
plausible
explanation
and
so
finally
gave
it
up
as
one
of
the
many
things
that
were
unexplainable
from
there
i
transferred
my
attention
to
the
study
door
i
could
see
now
even
more
plainly
the
effects
of
the
tremendous
strain
to
which
it
had
been
subjected
and
i
marveled
how
even
with
the
support
afforded
by
the
props
it
had
withstood
the
attacks
so
well
there
were
no
marks
of
blows
indeed
none
had
been
given
but
the
door
had
been
literally
riven
from
its
hinges
by
the
application
of
enormous
silent
force
one
thing
that
i
observed
affected
me
profoundly
the
head
of
one
of
the
props
had
been
driven
right
through
a
panel
this
was
of
itself
sufficient
to
show
how
huge
an
effort
the
creatures
had
made
to
break
down
the
door
and
how
nearly
they
had
succeeded
leaving
i
continued
my
tour
the
house
finding
little
else
of
interest
save
at
the
back
where
i
came
across
the
piece
of
piping
i
had
torn
from
the
wall
lying
among
the
long
grass
underneath
the
broken
window
then
i
returned
to
the
house
and
having
the
back
door
went
up
to
the
tower
here
i
spent
the
afternoon
reading
and
occasionally
glancing
down
into
the
gardens
i
had
determined
if
the
night
passed
quietly
to
go
as
far
as
the
pit
on
the
morrow
perhaps
i
should
be
able
to
learn
then
something
of
what
had
happened
the
day
slipped
away
and
the
night
came
and
went
much
as
the
last
few
nights
had
gone
when
i
rose
the
morning
had
broken
fine
and
clear
and
i
determined
to
put
my
project
into
action
during
breakfast
i
considered
the
matter
carefully
after
which
i
went
to
the
study
for
my
shotgun
in
addition
i
loaded
and
slipped
into
my
pocket
a
small
but
heavy
pistol
i
quite
understood
that
if
there
were
any
danger
it
lay
in
the
direction
of
the
pit
and
i
intended
to
be
prepared
leaving
the
study
i
went
down
to
the
back
door
followed
by
pepper
once
outside
i
took
a
quick
survey
of
the
surrounding
gardens
and
then
set
off
toward
the
pit
on
the
way
i
kept
a
sharp
outlook
holding
my
gun
handily
pepper
was
running
ahead
i
noticed
without
any
apparent
hesitation
from
this
i
augured
that
there
was
no
imminent
danger
to
be
apprehended
and
i
stepped
out
more
quickly
in
his
wake
he
had
reached
the
top
of
the
pit
now
and
was
nosing
his
way
along
the
edge
a
minute
later
i
was
beside
him
looking
down
into
the
pit
for
a
moment
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
it
was
the
same
place
so
greatly
was
it
changed
the
dark
wooded
ravine
of
a
fortnight
ago
with
a
stream
running
sluggishly
at
the
bottom
existed
no
longer
instead
my
eyes
showed
me
a
ragged
chasm
partly
filled
with
a
gloomy
lake
of
turbid
water
all
one
side
of
the
ravine
was
stripped
of
underwood
showing
the
bare
rock
a
little
to
my
left
the
side
of
the
pit
appeared
to
have
collapsed
altogether
forming
a
deep
cleft
in
the
face
of
the
rocky
cliff
this
rift
ran
from
the
upper
edge
of
the
ravine
nearly
down
to
the
water
and
penetrated
into
the
pit
side
to
a
distance
of
some
forty
feet
its
opening
was
at
least
six
yards
across
and
from
this
it
seemed
to
taper
into
about
two
but
what
attracted
my
attention
more
than
even
the
stupendous
split
itself
was
a
great
hole
some
distance
down
the
cleft
and
right
in
the
angle
of
the
it
was
clearly
defined
and
not
unlike
an
arched
doorway
in
shape
though
lying
as
it
did
in
the
shadow
i
could
not
see
it
very
distinctly
the
opposite
side
of
the
pit
still
retained
its
verdure
but
so
torn
in
places
and
everywhere
covered
with
dust
and
rubbish
that
it
was
hardly
distinguishable
as
such
my
first
impression
that
there
had
been
a
land
slip
was
i
began
to
see
not
sufficient
of
itself
to
account
for
all
the
changes
i
witnessed
and
the
water
i
turned
suddenly
for
i
had
become
aware
that
somewhere
to
my
right
there
was
a
noise
of
running
water
i
could
see
nothing
but
now
that
my
attention
had
been
caught
i
distinguished
easily
that
it
came
from
somewhere
at
the
east
end
of
the
pit
slowly
i
made
my
way
in
that
direction
the
sound
growing
plainer
as
i
advanced
until
in
a
little
i
stood
right
above
it
even
then
i
could
not
perceive
the
cause
until
i
knelt
down
and
thrust
my
head
over
the
cliff
here
the
noise
came
up
to
me
plainly
and
i
saw
below
me
a
torrent
of
clear
water
issuing
from
a
small
fissure
in
the
pit
side
and
rushing
down
the
rocks
into
the
lake
beneath
a
little
further
along
the
cliff
i
saw
another
and
beyond
that
again
two
smaller
ones
these
then
would
help
to
account
for
the
quantity
of
water
in
the
pit
and
if
the
fall
of
rock
and
earth
had
blocked
the
outlet
of
the
stream
at
the
bottom
there
was
little
doubt
but
that
it
was
contributing
a
very
large
share
yet
i
puzzled
my
head
to
account
for
the
generally
appearance
of
the
place
these
streamlets
and
that
huge
cleft
further
up
the
ravine
it
seemed
to
me
that
more
than
the
landslip
was
necessary
to
account
for
these
i
could
imagine
an
earthquake
or
a
great
creating
some
such
condition
of
affairs
as
existed
but
of
these
there
had
been
neither
then
i
stood
up
quickly
remembering
that
crash
and
the
cloud
of
dust
that
had
followed
directly
rushing
high
into
the
air
but
i
shook
my
head
unbelievingly
no
it
must
have
been
the
noise
of
the
falling
rocks
and
earth
i
had
heard
of
course
the
dust
would
fly
naturally
still
in
spite
of
my
reasoning
i
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
this
theory
did
not
satisfy
my
sense
of
the
probable
and
yet
was
any
other
that
i
could
suggest
likely
to
be
half
so
plausible
pepper
had
been
sitting
on
the
grass
while
i
conducted
my
examination
now
as
i
turned
up
the
north
side
of
the
ravine
he
rose
and
followed
slowly
and
keeping
a
careful
watch
in
all
directions
i
made
the
circuit
of
the
pit
but
found
little
else
that
i
had
not
already
seen
from
the
west
end
i
could
see
the
four
waterfalls
uninterruptedly
they
were
some
considerable
distance
up
from
the
surface
of
the
lake
about
fifty
feet
i
calculated
for
a
little
while
longer
i
loitered
about
keeping
my
eyes
and
ears
open
but
still
without
seeing
or
hearing
anything
suspicious
the
whole
place
was
wonderfully
quiet
indeed
save
for
the
continuous
murmur
of
the
water
at
the
top
end
no
sound
of
any
description
broke
the
silence
all
this
while
pepper
had
shown
no
signs
of
uneasiness
this
seemed
to
me
to
indicate
that
for
the
time
being
at
least
there
was
none
of
the
in
the
vicinity
so
far
as
i
could
see
his
attention
appeared
to
have
been
taken
chiefly
with
scratching
and
sniffing
among
the
grass
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
at
times
he
would
leave
the
edge
and
run
along
toward
the
house
as
though
following
invisible
tracks
but
in
all
cases
returning
after
a
few
minutes
i
had
little
doubt
but
that
he
was
really
tracing
out
the
footsteps
of
the
and
the
very
fact
that
each
one
seemed
to
lead
him
back
to
the
pit
appeared
to
me
a
proof
that
the
brutes
had
all
returned
whence
they
came
at
noon
i
went
home
for
dinner
during
the
afternoon
i
made
a
partial
search
of
the
gardens
accompanied
by
pepper
but
without
coming
upon
anything
to
indicate
the
presence
of
the
creatures
once
as
we
made
our
way
through
the
shrubberies
pepper
rushed
in
among
some
bushes
with
a
fierce
yelp
at
that
i
jumped
back
in
sudden
fright
and
threw
my
gun
forward
in
readiness
only
to
laugh
nervously
as
pepper
reappeared
chasing
an
unfortunate
cat
toward
evening
i
gave
up
the
search
and
returned
to
the
house
all
at
once
as
we
were
passing
a
great
clump
of
bushes
on
our
right
pepper
disappeared
and
i
could
hear
him
sniffing
and
growling
among
them
in
a
suspicious
manner
with
my
gun
barrel
i
parted
the
intervening
shrubbery
and
looked
inside
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
save
that
many
of
the
branches
were
bent
down
and
broken
as
though
some
animal
had
made
a
lair
there
at
no
very
previous
date
it
was
probably
i
thought
one
of
the
places
occupied
by
some
of
the
on
the
night
of
the
attack
next
day
i
resumed
my
search
through
the
gardens
but
without
result
by
evening
i
had
been
right
through
them
and
now
i
knew
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
that
there
were
no
longer
any
of
the
things
concealed
about
the
place
indeed
i
have
often
thought
since
that
i
was
correct
in
my
earlier
surmise
that
they
had
left
soon
after
the
attack
the
subterranean
pit
another
week
came
and
went
during
which
i
spent
a
great
deal
of
my
time
about
the
pit
mouth
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
a
few
days
earlier
that
the
arched
hole
in
the
angle
of
the
great
rift
was
the
place
through
which
the
had
made
their
exit
from
some
unholy
place
in
the
bowels
of
the
world
how
near
the
probable
truth
this
went
i
was
to
learn
later
it
may
be
easily
understood
that
i
was
tremendously
curious
though
in
a
frightened
way
to
know
to
what
infernal
place
that
hole
led
though
so
far
the
idea
had
not
struck
me
seriously
of
making
an
investigation
i
was
far
too
much
imbued
with
a
sense
of
horror
of
the
to
think
of
venturing
willingly
where
there
was
any
chance
of
coming
into
contact
with
them
gradually
however
as
time
passed
this
feeling
grew
insensibly
less
so
that
when
a
few
days
later
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
be
possible
to
clamber
down
and
have
a
look
into
the
hole
i
was
not
so
exceedingly
averse
to
it
as
might
have
been
imagined
still
i
do
not
think
even
then
that
i
really
intended
to
try
any
such
foolhardy
adventure
for
all
that
i
could
tell
it
might
be
certain
death
to
enter
that
doleful
looking
opening
and
yet
such
is
the
pertinacity
of
human
curiosity
that
at
last
my
chief
desire
was
but
to
discover
what
lay
beyond
that
gloomy
entrance
slowly
as
the
days
slid
by
my
fear
of
the
became
an
emotion
of
the
past
more
an
unpleasant
incredible
memory
than
aught
else
thus
a
day
came
when
throwing
thoughts
and
fancies
adrift
i
procured
a
rope
from
the
house
and
having
made
it
fast
to
a
stout
tree
at
the
top
of
the
rift
and
some
little
distance
back
from
the
pit
edge
let
the
other
end
down
into
the
cleft
until
it
dangled
right
across
the
mouth
of
the
dark
hole
then
cautiously
and
with
many
misgivings
as
to
whether
it
was
not
a
mad
act
that
i
was
attempting
i
climbed
slowly
down
using
the
rope
as
a
support
until
i
reached
the
hole
here
still
holding
on
to
the
rope
i
stood
and
peered
in
all
was
perfectly
dark
and
not
a
sound
came
to
me
yet
a
moment
later
it
seemed
that
i
could
hear
something
i
held
my
breath
and
listened
but
all
was
silent
as
the
grave
and
i
breathed
freely
once
more
at
the
same
instant
i
heard
the
sound
again
it
was
like
a
noise
of
labored
breathing
deep
and
for
a
short
second
i
stood
petrified
not
able
to
move
but
now
the
sounds
had
ceased
again
and
i
could
hear
nothing
as
i
stood
there
anxiously
my
foot
dislodged
a
pebble
which
fell
inward
into
the
dark
with
a
hollow
chink
at
once
the
noise
was
taken
up
and
repeated
a
score
of
times
each
succeeding
echo
being
fainter
and
seeming
to
travel
away
from
me
as
though
into
remote
distance
then
as
the
silence
fell
again
i
heard
that
stealthy
breathing
for
each
respiration
i
made
i
could
hear
an
answering
breath
the
sounds
appeared
to
be
coming
nearer
and
then
i
heard
several
others
but
fainter
and
more
distant
why
i
did
not
grip
the
rope
and
spring
up
out
of
danger
i
can
not
say
it
was
as
though
i
had
been
paralyzed
i
broke
out
into
a
profuse
sweat
and
tried
to
moisten
my
lips
with
my
tongue
my
throat
had
gone
suddenly
dry
and
i
coughed
huskily
it
came
back
to
me
in
a
dozen
horrible
throaty
tones
mockingly
i
peered
helplessly
into
the
gloom
but
still
nothing
showed
i
had
a
strange
choky
sensation
and
again
i
coughed
dryly
again
the
echo
took
it
up
rising
and
falling
grotesquely
and
dying
slowly
into
a
muffled
silence
then
suddenly
a
thought
came
to
me
and
i
held
my
breath
the
other
breathing
stopped
i
breathed
again
and
once
more
it
but
now
i
no
longer
feared
i
knew
that
the
strange
sounds
were
not
made
by
any
lurking
but
were
simply
the
echo
of
my
own
respirations
yet
i
had
received
such
a
fright
that
i
was
glad
to
scramble
up
the
rift
and
haul
up
the
rope
i
was
far
too
shaken
and
nervous
to
think
of
entering
that
dark
hole
then
and
so
returned
to
the
house
i
felt
more
myself
next
morning
but
even
then
i
could
not
summon
up
sufficient
courage
to
explore
the
place
all
this
time
the
water
in
the
pit
had
been
creeping
slowly
up
and
now
stood
but
a
little
below
the
opening
at
the
rate
at
which
it
was
rising
it
would
be
level
with
the
floor
in
less
than
another
week
and
i
realized
that
unless
i
carried
out
my
investigations
soon
i
should
probably
never
do
so
at
all
as
the
water
would
rise
and
rise
until
the
opening
itself
was
submerged
it
may
have
been
that
this
thought
stirred
me
to
act
but
whatever
it
was
a
couple
of
days
later
saw
me
standing
at
the
top
of
the
cleft
fully
equipped
for
the
task
this
time
i
was
resolved
to
conquer
my
shirking
and
go
right
through
with
the
matter
with
this
intention
i
had
brought
in
addition
to
the
rope
a
bundle
of
candles
meaning
to
use
them
as
a
torch
also
my
shotgun
in
my
belt
i
had
a
heavy
loaded
with
buckshot
as
before
i
fastened
the
rope
to
the
tree
then
having
tied
my
gun
across
my
shoulders
with
a
piece
of
stout
cord
i
lowered
myself
over
the
edge
of
the
pit
at
this
movement
pepper
who
had
been
eyeing
my
actions
watchfully
rose
to
his
feet
and
ran
to
me
with
a
half
bark
half
wail
it
seemed
to
me
of
warning
but
i
was
resolved
on
my
enterprise
and
bade
him
lie
down
i
would
much
have
liked
to
take
him
with
me
but
this
was
next
to
impossible
in
the
existing
circumstances
as
my
face
dropped
level
with
the
pit
edge
he
licked
me
right
across
the
mouth
and
then
seizing
my
sleeve
between
his
teeth
began
to
pull
back
strongly
it
was
very
evident
that
he
did
not
want
me
to
go
yet
having
made
up
my
mind
i
had
no
intention
of
giving
up
the
attempt
and
with
a
sharp
word
to
pepper
to
release
me
i
continued
my
descent
leaving
the
poor
old
fellow
at
the
top
barking
and
crying
like
a
forsaken
pup
carefully
i
lowered
myself
from
projection
to
projection
i
knew
that
a
slip
might
mean
a
wetting
reaching
the
entrance
i
let
go
the
rope
and
untied
the
gun
from
my
shoulders
then
with
a
last
look
at
the
sky
which
i
noticed
was
clouding
over
rapidly
i
went
forward
a
couple
of
paces
so
as
to
be
shielded
from
the
wind
and
lit
one
of
the
candles
holding
it
above
my
head
and
grasping
my
gun
firmly
i
began
to
move
on
slowly
throwing
my
glances
in
all
directions
for
the
first
minute
i
could
hear
the
melancholy
sound
of
howling
coming
down
to
me
gradually
as
i
penetrated
further
into
the
darkness
it
grew
fainter
until
in
a
little
while
i
could
hear
nothing
the
path
tended
downward
somewhat
and
to
the
left
thence
it
kept
on
still
running
to
the
left
until
i
found
that
it
was
leading
me
right
in
the
direction
of
the
house
very
cautiously
i
moved
onward
stopping
every
few
steps
to
listen
i
had
gone
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
when
suddenly
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
caught
a
faint
sound
somewhere
along
the
passage
behind
with
my
heart
thudding
heavily
i
listened
the
noise
grew
plainer
and
appeared
to
be
approaching
rapidly
i
could
hear
it
distinctly
now
it
was
the
soft
padding
of
running
feet
in
the
first
moments
of
fright
i
stood
irresolute
not
knowing
whether
to
go
forward
or
backward
then
with
a
sudden
realization
of
the
best
thing
to
do
i
backed
up
to
the
rocky
wall
on
my
right
and
holding
the
candle
above
my
head
waited
gun
in
hand
cursing
my
foolhardy
curiosity
for
bringing
me
into
such
a
strait
i
had
not
long
to
wait
but
a
few
seconds
before
two
eyes
reflected
back
from
the
gloom
the
rays
of
my
candle
i
raised
my
gun
using
my
right
hand
only
and
aimed
quickly
even
as
i
did
so
something
leapt
out
of
the
darkness
with
a
blustering
bark
of
joy
that
woke
the
echoes
like
thunder
it
was
pepper
how
he
had
contrived
to
scramble
down
the
cleft
i
could
not
conceive
as
i
brushed
my
hand
nervously
over
his
coat
i
noticed
that
he
was
dripping
and
concluded
that
he
must
have
tried
to
follow
me
and
fallen
into
the
water
from
which
he
would
not
find
it
very
difficult
to
climb
having
waited
a
minute
or
so
to
steady
myself
i
proceeded
along
the
way
pepper
following
quietly
i
was
curiously
glad
to
have
the
old
fellow
with
me
he
was
company
and
somehow
with
him
at
my
heels
i
was
less
afraid
also
i
knew
how
quickly
his
keen
ears
would
detect
the
presence
of
any
unwelcome
creature
should
there
be
such
amid
the
darkness
that
wrapped
us
for
some
minutes
we
went
slowly
along
the
path
still
leading
straight
toward
the
house
soon
i
concluded
we
should
be
standing
right
beneath
it
did
the
path
but
carry
far
enough
i
led
the
way
cautiously
for
another
fifty
yards
or
so
then
i
stopped
and
held
the
light
high
and
reason
enough
i
had
to
be
thankful
that
i
did
so
for
there
not
three
paces
forward
the
path
vanished
and
in
place
showed
a
hollow
blackness
that
sent
sudden
fear
through
me
very
cautiously
i
crept
forward
and
peered
down
but
could
see
nothing
then
i
crossed
to
the
left
of
the
passage
to
see
whether
there
might
be
any
continuation
of
the
path
here
right
against
the
wall
i
found
that
a
narrow
track
some
three
feet
wide
led
onward
carefully
i
stepped
on
to
it
but
had
not
gone
far
before
i
regretted
venturing
thereon
for
after
a
few
paces
the
already
narrow
way
resolved
itself
into
a
mere
ledge
with
on
the
one
side
the
solid
unyielding
rock
towering
up
in
a
great
wall
to
the
unseen
roof
and
on
the
other
that
yawning
chasm
i
could
not
help
reflecting
how
helpless
i
was
should
i
be
attacked
there
with
no
room
to
turn
and
where
even
the
recoil
of
my
weapon
might
be
sufficient
to
drive
me
headlong
into
the
depths
below
to
my
great
relief
a
little
further
on
the
track
suddenly
broadened
out
again
to
its
original
breadth
gradually
as
i
went
onward
i
noticed
that
the
path
trended
steadily
to
the
right
and
so
after
some
minutes
i
discovered
that
i
was
not
going
forward
but
simply
circling
the
huge
abyss
i
had
evidently
come
to
the
end
of
the
great
passage
five
minutes
later
i
stood
on
the
spot
from
which
i
had
started
having
been
completely
what
i
guessed
now
to
be
a
vast
pit
the
mouth
of
which
must
be
at
least
a
hundred
yards
across
for
some
little
time
i
stood
there
lost
in
perplexing
thought
does
it
all
mean
was
the
cry
that
had
begun
to
reiterate
through
my
brain
a
sudden
idea
struck
me
and
i
searched
for
a
piece
of
stone
presently
i
found
a
bit
of
rock
about
the
size
of
a
small
loaf
sticking
the
candle
upright
in
a
crevice
of
the
floor
i
went
back
from
the
edge
somewhat
and
taking
a
short
run
launched
the
stone
forward
into
the
chasm
my
idea
being
to
throw
it
far
enough
to
keep
it
clear
of
the
sides
then
i
stooped
forward
and
listened
but
though
i
kept
perfectly
quiet
for
at
least
a
full
minute
no
sound
came
back
to
me
from
out
of
the
dark
i
knew
then
that
the
depth
of
the
hole
must
be
immense
for
the
stone
had
it
struck
anything
was
large
enough
to
have
set
the
echoes
of
that
weird
place
whispering
for
an
indefinite
period
even
as
it
was
the
cavern
had
given
back
the
sounds
of
my
footfalls
multitudinously
the
place
was
awesome
and
i
would
willingly
have
retraced
my
steps
and
left
the
mysteries
of
its
solitudes
unsolved
only
to
do
so
meant
admitting
defeat
then
a
thought
came
to
try
to
get
a
view
of
the
abyss
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
placed
my
candles
the
edge
of
the
hole
i
should
be
able
to
get
at
least
some
dim
sight
of
the
place
i
found
on
counting
that
i
had
brought
fifteen
candles
in
the
bundle
my
first
intention
having
been
as
i
have
already
said
to
make
a
torch
of
the
lot
these
i
proceeded
to
place
the
pit
mouth
with
an
interval
of
about
twenty
yards
between
each
having
completed
the
circle
i
stood
in
the
passage
and
endeavored
to
get
an
idea
of
how
the
place
looked
but
i
discovered
immediately
that
they
were
totally
insufficient
for
my
purpose
they
did
little
more
than
make
the
gloom
visible
one
thing
they
did
however
and
that
was
they
confirmed
my
opinion
of
the
size
of
the
opening
and
although
they
showed
me
nothing
that
i
wanted
to
see
yet
the
contrast
they
afforded
to
the
heavy
darkness
pleased
me
curiously
it
was
as
though
fifteen
tiny
stars
shone
through
the
subterranean
night
then
even
as
i
stood
pepper
gave
a
sudden
howl
that
was
taken
up
by
the
echoes
and
repeated
with
ghastly
variations
dying
away
slowly
with
a
quick
movement
i
held
aloft
the
one
candle
that
i
had
kept
and
glanced
down
at
the
dog
at
the
same
moment
i
seemed
to
hear
a
noise
like
a
diabolical
chuckle
rise
up
from
the
hitherto
silent
depths
of
the
pit
i
started
then
i
recollected
that
it
was
probably
the
echo
of
pepper
howl
pepper
had
moved
away
from
me
up
the
passage
a
few
steps
he
was
nosing
along
the
rocky
floor
and
i
thought
i
heard
him
lapping
i
went
toward
him
holding
the
candle
low
as
i
moved
i
heard
my
boot
go
sop
sop
and
the
light
was
reflected
from
something
that
glistened
and
crept
past
my
feet
swiftly
toward
the
pit
i
bent
lower
and
looked
then
gave
vent
to
an
expression
of
surprise
from
somewhere
higher
up
the
path
a
stream
of
water
was
running
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
great
opening
and
growing
in
size
every
second
again
pepper
gave
vent
to
that
howl
and
running
at
me
seized
my
coat
and
attempted
to
drag
me
up
the
path
toward
the
entrance
with
a
nervous
gesture
i
shook
him
off
and
crossed
quickly
over
to
the
wall
if
anything
were
coming
i
was
going
to
have
the
wall
at
my
back
then
as
i
stared
anxiously
up
the
pathway
my
candle
caught
a
gleam
far
up
the
passage
at
the
same
moment
i
became
conscious
of
a
murmurous
roar
that
grew
louder
and
filled
the
whole
cavern
with
deafening
sound
from
the
pit
came
a
deep
hollow
echo
like
the
sob
of
a
giant
then
i
had
sprung
to
one
side
on
to
the
narrow
ledge
that
ran
the
abyss
and
turning
saw
a
great
wall
of
foam
sweep
past
me
and
leap
tumultuously
into
the
waiting
chasm
a
cloud
of
spray
burst
over
me
extinguishing
my
candle
and
wetting
me
to
the
skin
i
still
held
my
gun
the
three
nearest
candles
went
out
but
the
further
ones
gave
only
a
short
flicker
after
the
first
rush
the
flow
of
water
eased
down
to
a
steady
stream
maybe
a
foot
in
depth
though
i
could
not
see
this
until
i
had
procured
one
of
the
lighted
candles
and
with
it
started
to
reconnoiter
pepper
had
fortunately
followed
me
as
i
leapt
for
the
ledge
and
now
very
much
subdued
kept
close
behind
a
short
examination
showed
me
that
the
water
reached
right
across
the
passage
and
was
running
at
a
tremendous
rate
already
even
as
i
stood
there
it
had
deepened
i
could
make
only
a
guess
at
what
had
happened
evidently
the
water
in
the
ravine
had
broken
into
the
passage
by
some
means
if
that
were
the
case
it
would
go
on
increasing
in
volume
until
i
should
find
it
impossible
to
leave
the
place
the
thought
was
frightening
it
was
evident
that
i
must
make
my
exit
as
hurriedly
as
possible
taking
my
gun
by
the
stock
i
sounded
the
water
it
was
a
little
under
the
noise
it
made
plunging
down
into
the
pit
was
deafening
then
with
a
call
to
pepper
i
stepped
out
into
the
flood
using
the
gun
as
a
staff
instantly
the
water
boiled
up
over
my
knees
and
nearly
to
the
tops
of
my
thighs
with
the
speed
at
which
it
was
racing
for
one
short
moment
i
nearly
lost
my
footing
but
the
thought
of
what
lay
behind
stimulated
me
to
a
fierce
endeavor
and
i
made
headway
of
pepper
i
knew
nothing
at
first
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
keep
on
my
legs
and
was
overjoyed
when
he
appeared
beside
me
he
was
wading
manfully
along
he
is
a
big
dog
with
longish
thin
legs
and
i
suppose
the
water
had
less
grasp
on
them
than
upon
mine
anyway
he
managed
a
great
deal
better
than
i
did
going
ahead
of
me
like
a
guide
and
wittingly
or
otherwise
helping
somewhat
to
break
the
force
of
the
water
on
we
went
step
by
step
struggling
and
gasping
until
somewhere
about
a
hundred
yards
had
been
safely
traversed
then
whether
it
was
because
i
was
taking
less
care
or
that
there
was
a
slippery
place
on
the
rocky
floor
i
can
not
say
but
suddenly
i
slipped
and
fell
on
my
face
instantly
the
water
leapt
over
me
in
a
cataract
hurling
me
down
toward
that
bottomless
hole
at
a
frightful
speed
frantically
i
struggled
but
it
was
impossible
to
get
a
footing
i
was
helpless
gasping
and
drowning
all
at
once
something
gripped
my
coat
and
brought
me
to
a
standstill
it
was
pepper
missing
me
he
must
have
raced
back
through
the
dark
turmoil
to
find
me
and
then
caught
and
held
me
until
i
was
able
to
get
to
my
feet
i
have
a
dim
recollection
of
having
seen
momentarily
the
gleams
of
several
lights
but
of
this
i
have
never
been
quite
sure
if
my
impressions
are
correct
i
must
have
been
washed
down
to
the
very
brink
of
that
awful
chasm
before
pepper
managed
to
bring
me
to
a
standstill
and
the
lights
of
course
could
only
have
been
the
distant
flames
of
the
candles
i
had
left
burning
but
as
i
have
said
i
am
not
by
any
means
sure
my
eyes
were
full
of
water
and
i
had
been
badly
shaken
and
there
was
i
without
my
helpful
gun
without
light
and
sadly
confused
with
the
water
deepening
depending
solely
upon
my
old
friend
pepper
to
help
me
out
of
that
hellish
place
i
was
facing
the
torrent
naturally
it
was
the
only
way
in
which
i
could
have
sustained
my
position
a
moment
for
even
old
pepper
could
not
have
held
me
long
against
that
terrific
strain
without
assistance
however
blind
from
me
perhaps
a
minute
passed
during
which
it
was
touch
and
go
with
me
then
gradually
i
my
tortuous
way
up
the
passage
and
so
began
the
grimmest
fight
with
death
from
which
ever
i
hope
to
emerge
victorious
slowly
furiously
almost
hopelessly
i
strove
and
that
faithful
pepper
led
me
dragged
me
upward
and
onward
until
at
last
ahead
i
saw
a
gleam
of
blessed
light
it
was
the
entrance
only
a
few
yards
further
and
i
reached
the
opening
with
the
water
surging
and
boiling
hungrily
around
my
loins
and
now
i
understood
the
cause
of
the
catastrophe
it
was
raining
heavily
literally
in
torrents
the
surface
of
the
lake
was
level
with
the
bottom
of
the
opening
nay
more
than
level
it
was
above
it
evidently
the
rain
had
swollen
the
lake
and
caused
this
premature
rise
for
at
the
rate
the
ravine
had
been
filling
it
would
not
have
reached
the
entrance
for
a
couple
more
days
luckily
the
rope
by
which
i
had
descended
was
streaming
into
the
opening
upon
the
inrushing
waters
seizing
the
end
i
knotted
it
securely
pepper
body
then
summoning
up
the
last
remnant
of
my
strength
i
commenced
to
swarm
up
the
side
of
the
cliff
i
reached
the
pit
edge
in
the
last
stage
of
exhaustion
yet
i
had
to
make
one
more
effort
and
haul
pepper
into
safety
slowly
and
wearily
i
hauled
on
the
rope
once
or
twice
it
seemed
that
i
should
have
to
give
up
for
pepper
is
a
weighty
dog
and
i
was
utterly
done
yet
to
let
go
would
have
meant
certain
death
to
the
old
fellow
and
the
thought
spurred
me
to
greater
exertions
i
have
but
a
very
hazy
remembrance
of
the
end
i
recall
pulling
through
moments
that
lagged
strangely
i
have
also
some
recollection
of
seeing
pepper
muzzle
appearing
over
the
pit
edge
after
what
seemed
an
indefinite
period
of
time
then
all
grew
suddenly
dark
the
trap
in
the
great
cellar
i
suppose
i
must
have
swooned
for
the
next
thing
i
remember
i
opened
my
eyes
and
all
was
dusk
i
was
lying
on
my
back
with
one
leg
doubled
under
the
other
and
pepper
was
licking
my
ears
i
felt
horribly
stiff
and
my
leg
was
numb
from
the
knee
downward
for
a
few
minutes
i
lay
thus
in
a
dazed
condition
then
slowly
i
struggled
to
a
sitting
position
and
looked
about
me
it
had
stopped
raining
but
the
trees
still
dripped
dismally
from
the
pit
came
a
continuous
murmur
of
running
water
i
felt
cold
and
shivery
my
clothes
were
sodden
and
i
ached
all
over
very
slowly
the
life
came
back
into
my
numbed
leg
and
after
a
little
i
essayed
to
stand
up
this
i
managed
at
the
second
attempt
but
i
was
very
tottery
and
peculiarly
weak
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
going
to
be
ill
and
i
made
shift
to
stumble
my
way
toward
the
house
my
steps
were
erratic
and
my
head
confused
at
each
step
that
i
took
sharp
pains
shot
through
my
limbs
i
had
gone
perhaps
some
thirty
paces
when
a
cry
from
pepper
drew
my
attention
and
i
turned
stiffly
toward
him
the
old
dog
was
trying
to
follow
me
but
could
come
no
further
owing
to
the
rope
with
which
i
had
hauled
him
up
being
still
tied
his
body
the
other
end
not
having
been
unfastened
from
the
tree
for
a
moment
i
fumbled
with
the
knots
weakly
but
they
were
wet
and
hard
and
i
could
do
nothing
then
i
remembered
my
knife
and
in
a
minute
the
rope
was
cut
how
i
reached
the
house
i
scarcely
know
and
of
the
days
that
followed
i
remember
still
less
of
one
thing
i
am
certain
that
had
it
not
been
for
my
sister
untiring
love
and
nursing
i
had
not
been
writing
at
this
moment
when
i
recovered
my
senses
it
was
to
find
that
i
had
been
in
bed
for
nearly
two
weeks
yet
another
week
passed
before
i
was
strong
enough
to
totter
out
into
the
gardens
even
then
i
was
not
able
to
walk
so
far
as
the
pit
i
would
have
liked
to
ask
my
sister
how
high
the
water
had
risen
but
felt
it
was
wiser
not
to
mention
the
subject
to
her
indeed
since
then
i
have
made
a
rule
never
to
speak
to
her
about
the
strange
things
that
happen
in
this
great
old
house
it
was
not
until
a
couple
of
days
later
that
i
managed
to
get
across
to
the
pit
there
i
found
that
in
my
few
weeks
absence
there
had
been
wrought
a
wondrous
change
instead
of
the
filled
ravine
i
looked
out
upon
a
great
lake
whose
placid
surface
reflected
the
light
coldly
the
water
had
risen
to
within
half
a
dozen
feet
of
the
pit
edge
only
in
one
part
was
the
lake
disturbed
and
that
was
above
the
place
where
far
down
under
the
silent
waters
yawned
the
entrance
to
the
vast
underground
pit
here
there
was
a
continuous
bubbling
and
occasionally
a
curious
sort
of
sobbing
gurgle
would
find
its
way
up
from
the
depth
beyond
these
there
was
nothing
to
tell
of
the
things
that
were
hidden
beneath
as
i
stood
there
it
came
to
me
how
wonderfully
things
had
worked
out
the
entrance
to
the
place
whence
the
had
come
was
sealed
up
by
a
power
that
made
me
feel
there
was
nothing
more
to
fear
from
them
and
yet
with
the
feeling
there
was
a
sensation
that
now
i
should
never
learn
anything
further
of
the
place
from
which
those
dreadful
things
had
come
it
was
completely
shut
off
and
concealed
from
human
curiosity
forever
strange
in
the
knowledge
of
that
underground
how
apposite
has
been
the
naming
of
the
pit
one
wonders
how
it
originated
and
when
naturally
one
concludes
that
the
shape
and
depth
of
the
ravine
would
suggest
the
name
yet
is
it
not
possible
that
it
has
all
along
held
a
deeper
significance
a
hint
could
one
but
have
guessed
of
the
greater
more
stupendous
pit
that
lies
far
down
in
the
earth
beneath
this
old
house
under
this
house
even
now
the
idea
is
strange
and
terrible
to
me
for
i
have
proved
beyond
doubt
that
the
pit
yawns
right
below
the
house
which
is
evidently
supported
somewhere
above
the
center
of
it
upon
a
tremendous
arched
roof
of
solid
rock
it
happened
in
this
wise
that
having
occasion
to
go
down
to
the
cellars
the
thought
occurred
to
me
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
great
vault
where
the
trap
is
situated
and
see
whether
everything
was
as
i
had
left
it
reaching
the
place
i
walked
slowly
up
the
center
until
i
came
to
the
trap
there
it
was
with
the
stones
piled
upon
it
just
as
i
had
seen
it
last
i
had
a
lantern
with
me
and
the
idea
came
to
me
that
now
would
be
a
good
time
to
investigate
whatever
lay
under
the
great
oak
slab
placing
the
lantern
on
the
floor
i
tumbled
the
stones
off
the
trap
and
grasping
the
ring
pulled
the
door
open
as
i
did
so
the
cellar
became
filled
with
the
sound
of
a
murmurous
thunder
that
rose
from
far
below
at
the
same
time
a
damp
wind
blew
up
into
my
face
bringing
with
it
a
load
of
fine
spray
therewith
i
dropped
the
trap
hurriedly
with
a
half
frightened
feeling
of
wonder
for
a
moment
i
stood
puzzled
i
was
not
particularly
afraid
the
haunting
fear
of
the
had
left
me
long
ago
but
i
was
certainly
nervous
and
astonished
then
a
sudden
thought
possessed
me
and
i
raised
the
ponderous
door
with
a
feeling
of
excitement
leaving
it
standing
upon
its
end
i
seized
the
lantern
and
kneeling
down
thrust
it
into
the
opening
as
i
did
so
the
moist
wind
and
spray
drove
in
my
eyes
making
me
unable
to
see
for
a
few
moments
even
when
my
eyes
were
clear
i
could
distinguish
nothing
below
me
save
darkness
and
whirling
spray
seeing
that
it
was
useless
to
expect
to
make
out
anything
with
the
light
so
high
i
felt
in
my
pockets
for
a
piece
of
twine
with
which
to
lower
it
further
into
the
opening
even
as
i
fumbled
the
lantern
slipped
from
my
fingers
and
hurtled
down
into
the
darkness
for
a
brief
instant
i
watched
its
fall
and
saw
the
light
shine
on
a
tumult
of
white
foam
some
eighty
or
a
hundred
feet
below
me
then
it
was
gone
my
sudden
surmise
was
correct
and
now
i
knew
the
cause
of
the
wet
and
noise
the
great
cellar
was
connected
with
the
pit
by
means
of
the
trap
which
opened
right
above
it
and
the
moisture
was
the
spray
rising
from
the
water
falling
into
the
depths
in
an
instant
i
had
an
explanation
of
certain
things
that
had
hitherto
puzzled
me
now
i
could
understand
why
the
noises
on
the
first
night
of
the
invasion
had
seemed
to
rise
directly
from
under
my
feet
and
the
chuckle
that
had
sounded
when
first
i
opened
the
trap
evidently
some
of
the
must
have
been
right
beneath
me
another
thought
struck
me
were
the
creatures
all
drowned
would
they
drown
i
remembered
how
unable
i
had
been
to
find
any
traces
to
show
that
my
shooting
had
been
really
fatal
had
they
life
as
we
understand
life
or
were
they
ghouls
these
thoughts
flashed
through
my
brain
as
i
stood
in
the
dark
searching
my
pockets
for
matches
i
had
the
box
in
my
hand
now
and
striking
a
light
i
stepped
to
the
trap
door
and
closed
it
then
i
piled
the
stones
back
upon
it
after
which
i
made
my
way
out
from
the
cellars
and
so
i
suppose
the
water
goes
on
thundering
down
into
that
bottomless
sometimes
i
have
an
inexplicable
desire
to
go
down
to
the
great
cellar
open
the
trap
and
gaze
into
the
impenetrable
darkness
at
times
the
desire
becomes
almost
overpowering
in
its
intensity
it
is
not
mere
curiosity
that
prompts
me
but
more
as
though
some
unexplained
influence
were
at
work
still
i
never
go
and
intend
to
fight
down
the
strange
longing
and
crush
it
even
as
i
would
the
unholy
thought
of
this
idea
of
some
intangible
force
being
exerted
may
seem
reasonless
yet
my
instinct
warns
me
that
it
is
not
so
in
these
things
reason
seems
to
me
less
to
be
trusted
than
instinct
one
thought
there
is
in
closing
that
impresses
itself
upon
me
with
ever
growing
insistence
it
is
that
i
live
in
a
very
strange
house
a
very
awful
house
and
i
have
begun
to
wonder
whether
i
am
doing
wisely
in
staying
here
yet
if
i
left
where
could
i
go
and
still
obtain
the
solitude
and
the
sense
of
her
presence
that
alone
make
my
old
life
bearable
the
sea
of
sleep
for
a
considerable
period
after
the
last
incident
which
i
have
narrated
in
my
diary
i
had
serious
thoughts
of
leaving
this
house
and
might
have
done
so
but
for
the
great
and
wonderful
thing
of
which
i
am
about
to
write
how
well
i
was
advised
in
my
heart
when
i
stayed
on
here
spite
of
those
visions
and
sights
of
unknown
and
unexplainable
things
for
had
i
not
stayed
then
i
had
not
seen
again
the
face
of
her
i
loved
yes
though
few
know
it
none
now
save
my
sister
mary
i
have
loved
and
ah
me
lost
i
would
write
down
the
story
of
those
sweet
old
days
but
it
would
be
like
the
tearing
of
old
wounds
yet
after
that
which
has
happened
what
need
have
i
to
care
for
she
has
come
to
me
out
of
the
unknown
strangely
she
warned
me
warned
me
passionately
against
this
house
begged
me
to
leave
it
but
admitted
when
i
questioned
her
that
she
could
not
have
come
to
me
had
i
been
elsewhere
yet
in
spite
of
this
still
she
warned
me
earnestly
telling
me
that
it
was
a
place
long
ago
given
over
to
evil
and
under
the
power
of
grim
laws
of
which
none
here
have
knowledge
and
i
i
just
asked
her
again
whether
she
would
come
to
me
elsewhere
and
she
could
only
stand
silent
it
was
thus
that
i
came
to
the
place
of
the
sea
of
sleep
so
she
termed
it
in
her
dear
speech
with
me
i
had
stayed
up
in
my
study
reading
and
must
have
dozed
over
the
book
suddenly
i
awoke
and
sat
upright
with
a
start
for
a
moment
i
looked
with
a
puzzled
sense
of
something
unusual
there
was
a
misty
look
about
the
room
giving
a
curious
softness
to
each
table
and
chair
and
furnishing
gradually
the
mistiness
increased
growing
as
it
were
out
of
nothing
then
slowly
a
soft
white
light
began
to
glow
in
the
room
the
flames
of
the
candles
shone
through
it
palely
i
looked
from
side
to
side
and
found
that
i
could
still
see
each
piece
of
furniture
but
in
a
strangely
unreal
way
more
as
though
the
ghost
of
each
table
and
chair
had
taken
the
place
of
the
solid
article
gradually
as
i
looked
i
saw
them
fade
and
fade
until
slowly
they
resolved
into
nothingness
now
i
looked
again
at
the
candles
they
shone
wanly
and
even
as
i
watched
grew
more
unreal
and
so
vanished
the
room
was
filled
now
with
a
soft
yet
luminous
white
twilight
like
a
gentle
mist
of
light
beyond
this
i
could
see
nothing
even
the
walls
had
vanished
presently
i
became
conscious
that
a
faint
continuous
sound
pulsed
through
the
silence
that
wrapped
me
i
listened
intently
it
grew
more
distinct
until
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
harked
to
the
breathings
of
some
great
sea
i
can
not
tell
how
long
a
space
passed
thus
but
after
a
while
it
seemed
that
i
could
see
through
the
mistiness
and
slowly
i
became
aware
that
i
was
standing
upon
the
shore
of
an
immense
and
silent
sea
this
shore
was
smooth
and
long
vanishing
to
right
and
left
of
me
in
extreme
distances
in
front
swam
a
still
immensity
of
sleeping
ocean
at
times
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
caught
a
faint
glimmer
of
light
under
its
surface
but
of
this
i
could
not
be
sure
behind
me
rose
up
to
an
extraordinary
height
gaunt
black
cliffs
overhead
the
sky
was
of
a
uniform
cold
grey
color
the
whole
place
being
lit
by
a
stupendous
globe
of
pale
fire
that
swam
a
little
above
the
far
horizon
and
shed
a
foamlike
light
above
the
quiet
waters
beyond
the
gentle
murmur
of
the
sea
an
intense
stillness
prevailed
for
a
long
while
i
stayed
there
looking
out
across
its
strangeness
then
as
i
stared
it
seemed
that
a
bubble
of
white
foam
floated
up
out
of
the
depths
and
then
even
now
i
know
not
how
it
was
i
was
looking
upon
nay
looking
the
face
of
her
aye
into
her
face
into
her
soul
and
she
looked
back
at
me
with
such
a
commingling
of
joy
and
sadness
that
i
ran
toward
her
blindly
crying
strangely
to
her
in
a
very
agony
of
remembrance
of
terror
and
of
hope
to
come
to
me
yet
spite
of
my
crying
she
stayed
out
there
upon
the
sea
and
only
shook
her
head
sorrowfully
but
in
her
eyes
was
the
old
of
tenderness
that
i
had
come
to
know
before
all
things
ere
we
were
parted
at
her
perverseness
i
grew
desperate
and
essayed
to
wade
out
to
her
yet
though
i
would
i
could
not
something
some
invisible
barrier
held
me
back
and
i
was
fain
to
stay
where
i
was
and
cry
out
to
her
in
the
fullness
of
my
soul
my
darling
my
darling
but
could
say
no
more
for
very
intensity
and
at
that
she
came
over
swiftly
and
touched
me
and
it
was
as
though
heaven
had
opened
yet
when
i
reached
out
my
hands
to
her
she
put
me
from
her
with
tenderly
stern
hands
and
i
was
abashed
the
fragments
legible
portions
of
the
mutilated
through
tears
noise
of
eternity
in
my
ears
we
parted
she
whom
i
love
o
my
god
i
was
a
great
time
dazed
and
then
i
was
alone
in
the
blackness
of
the
night
i
knew
that
i
journeyed
back
once
more
to
the
known
universe
presently
i
emerged
from
that
enormous
darkness
i
had
come
among
the
stars
vast
time
the
sun
far
and
remote
i
entered
into
the
gulf
that
separates
our
system
from
the
outer
suns
as
i
sped
across
the
dividing
dark
i
watched
steadily
the
brightness
and
size
of
our
sun
once
i
glanced
back
to
the
stars
and
saw
them
shift
as
it
were
in
my
wake
against
the
mighty
background
of
night
so
vast
was
the
speed
of
my
passing
spirit
i
drew
nigher
to
our
system
and
now
i
could
see
the
shine
of
jupiter
later
i
distinguished
the
cold
blue
gleam
of
the
earthlight
i
had
a
moment
of
bewilderment
all
about
the
sun
there
seemed
to
be
bright
objects
moving
in
rapid
orbits
inward
nigh
to
the
savage
glory
of
the
sun
there
circled
two
darting
points
of
light
and
further
off
there
flew
a
blue
shining
speck
that
i
knew
to
be
the
earth
it
circled
the
sun
in
a
space
that
seemed
to
be
no
more
than
an
nearer
with
great
speed
i
saw
the
radiances
of
jupiter
and
saturn
spinning
with
incredible
swiftness
in
huge
orbits
and
ever
i
drew
more
nigh
and
looked
out
upon
this
strange
sight
the
visible
circling
of
the
planets
about
the
mother
sun
it
was
as
though
time
had
been
annihilated
for
me
so
that
a
year
was
no
more
to
my
unfleshed
spirit
than
is
a
moment
to
an
soul
the
speed
of
the
planets
appeared
to
increase
and
presently
i
was
watching
the
sun
all
ringed
about
with
circles
of
different
colored
fire
the
paths
of
the
planets
hurtling
at
mighty
speed
about
the
central
flame
the
sun
grew
vast
as
though
it
leapt
to
meet
me
and
now
i
was
within
the
circling
of
the
outer
planets
and
flitting
swiftly
toward
the
place
where
the
earth
glimmering
through
the
blue
splendor
of
its
orbit
as
though
a
fiery
mist
circled
the
sun
at
a
monstrous
speed
the
noise
in
the
night
and
now
i
come
to
the
strangest
of
all
the
strange
happenings
that
have
befallen
me
in
this
house
of
mysteries
it
occurred
quite
lately
within
the
month
and
i
have
little
doubt
but
that
what
i
saw
was
in
reality
the
end
of
all
things
however
to
my
story
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
but
up
to
the
present
i
have
never
been
able
to
write
these
things
down
directly
they
happened
it
is
as
though
i
have
to
wait
a
time
recovering
my
just
balance
and
digesting
as
it
were
the
things
i
have
heard
or
seen
no
doubt
this
is
as
it
should
be
for
by
waiting
i
see
the
incidents
more
truly
and
write
of
them
in
a
calmer
and
more
judicial
frame
of
mind
this
by
the
way
it
is
now
the
end
of
november
my
story
relates
to
what
happened
in
the
first
week
of
the
month
it
was
night
about
eleven
pepper
and
i
kept
one
another
company
in
the
study
that
great
old
room
of
mine
where
i
read
and
work
i
was
reading
curiously
enough
the
bible
i
have
begun
in
these
later
days
to
take
a
growing
interest
in
that
great
and
ancient
book
suddenly
a
distinct
tremor
shook
the
house
and
there
came
a
faint
and
distant
whirring
buzz
that
grew
rapidly
into
a
far
muffled
screaming
it
reminded
me
in
a
queer
gigantic
way
of
the
noise
that
a
clock
makes
when
the
catch
is
released
and
it
is
allowed
to
run
down
the
sound
appeared
to
come
from
some
remote
height
somewhere
up
in
the
night
there
was
no
repetition
of
the
shock
i
looked
across
at
pepper
he
was
sleeping
peacefully
gradually
the
whirring
noise
decreased
and
there
came
a
long
silence
all
at
once
a
glow
lit
up
the
end
window
which
protrudes
far
out
from
the
side
of
the
house
so
that
from
it
one
may
look
both
east
and
west
i
felt
puzzled
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
walked
across
the
room
and
pulled
aside
the
blind
as
i
did
so
i
saw
the
sun
rise
from
behind
the
horizon
it
rose
with
a
steady
perceptible
movement
i
could
see
it
travel
upward
in
a
minute
it
seemed
it
had
reached
the
tops
of
the
trees
through
which
i
had
watched
it
up
up
it
was
broad
daylight
now
behind
me
i
was
conscious
of
a
sharp
buzzing
i
glanced
and
knew
that
it
came
from
the
clock
even
as
i
looked
it
marked
off
an
hour
the
minute
hand
was
moving
the
dial
faster
than
an
ordinary
the
hour
hand
moved
quickly
from
space
to
space
i
had
a
numb
sense
of
astonishment
a
moment
later
so
it
seemed
the
two
candles
went
out
almost
together
i
turned
swiftly
back
to
the
window
for
i
had
seen
the
shadow
of
the
traveling
along
the
floor
toward
me
as
though
a
great
lamp
had
been
carried
up
past
the
window
i
saw
now
that
the
sun
had
risen
high
into
the
heavens
and
was
still
visibly
moving
it
passed
above
the
house
with
an
extraordinary
sailing
kind
of
motion
as
the
window
came
into
shadow
i
saw
another
extraordinary
thing
the
clouds
were
not
passing
easily
across
the
sky
they
were
scampering
as
though
a
wind
blew
as
they
passed
they
changed
their
shapes
a
thousand
times
a
minute
as
though
writhing
with
a
strange
life
and
so
were
gone
and
presently
others
came
and
whisked
away
likewise
to
the
west
i
saw
the
sun
drop
with
an
incredible
smooth
swift
motion
eastward
the
shadows
of
every
seen
thing
crept
toward
the
coming
greyness
and
the
movement
of
the
shadows
was
visible
to
me
a
stealthy
writhing
creep
of
the
shadows
of
the
trees
it
was
a
strange
sight
quickly
the
room
began
to
darken
the
sun
slid
down
to
the
horizon
and
seemed
as
it
were
to
disappear
from
my
sight
almost
with
a
jerk
through
the
greyness
of
the
swift
evening
i
saw
the
silver
crescent
of
the
moon
falling
out
of
the
southern
sky
toward
the
west
the
evening
seemed
to
merge
into
an
almost
instant
night
above
me
the
many
constellations
passed
in
a
strange
circling
westward
the
moon
fell
through
that
last
thousand
fathoms
of
the
and
there
was
only
the
starlight
about
this
time
the
buzzing
in
the
corner
ceased
telling
me
that
the
clock
had
run
down
a
few
minutes
passed
and
i
saw
the
eastward
sky
lighten
a
grey
sullen
morning
spread
through
all
the
darkness
and
hid
the
march
of
the
stars
overhead
there
moved
with
a
heavy
everlasting
rolling
a
vast
seamless
sky
of
grey
clouds
a
that
would
have
seemed
motionless
through
all
the
length
of
an
ordinary
the
sun
was
hidden
from
me
but
from
moment
to
moment
the
world
would
brighten
and
darken
brighten
and
darken
beneath
waves
of
subtle
light
and
shadow
the
light
shifted
ever
westward
and
the
night
fell
upon
the
earth
a
vast
rain
seemed
to
come
with
it
and
a
wind
of
a
most
extraordinary
loudness
as
though
the
howling
of
a
nightlong
gale
were
packed
into
the
space
of
no
more
than
a
minute
this
noise
passed
almost
immediately
and
the
clouds
broke
so
that
once
more
i
could
see
the
sky
the
stars
were
flying
westward
with
astounding
speed
it
came
to
me
now
for
the
first
time
that
though
the
noise
of
the
wind
had
passed
yet
a
constant
sound
was
in
my
ears
now
that
i
noticed
it
i
was
aware
that
it
had
been
with
me
all
the
time
it
was
the
and
then
even
as
i
grasped
at
so
much
comprehension
there
came
the
eastward
light
no
more
than
a
few
heartbeats
and
the
sun
rose
swiftly
through
the
trees
i
saw
it
and
then
it
was
above
the
trees
up
up
it
soared
and
all
the
world
was
light
it
passed
with
a
swift
steady
swing
to
its
highest
altitude
and
fell
thence
westward
i
saw
the
day
roll
visibly
over
my
head
a
few
light
clouds
flittered
northward
and
vanished
the
sun
went
down
with
one
swift
clear
plunge
and
there
was
about
me
for
a
few
seconds
the
darker
growing
grey
of
the
gloaming
southward
and
westward
the
moon
was
sinking
rapidly
the
night
had
come
already
a
minute
it
seemed
and
the
moon
fell
those
remaining
fathoms
of
dark
sky
another
minute
or
so
and
the
eastward
sky
glowed
with
the
coming
dawn
the
sun
leapt
upon
me
with
a
frightening
abruptness
and
soared
ever
more
swiftly
toward
the
zenith
then
suddenly
a
fresh
thing
came
to
my
sight
a
black
thundercloud
rushed
up
out
of
the
south
and
seemed
to
leap
all
the
arc
of
the
sky
in
a
single
instant
as
it
came
i
saw
that
its
advancing
edge
flapped
like
a
monstrous
black
cloth
in
the
heaven
twirling
and
undulating
rapidly
with
a
horrid
suggestiveness
in
an
instant
all
the
air
was
full
of
rain
and
a
hundred
lightning
flashes
seemed
to
flood
downward
as
it
were
in
one
great
shower
in
the
same
second
of
time
the
was
drowned
in
the
roar
of
the
wind
and
then
my
ears
ached
under
the
stunning
impact
of
the
thunder
and
in
the
midst
of
this
storm
the
night
came
and
then
within
the
space
of
another
minute
the
storm
had
passed
and
there
was
only
the
constant
of
the
on
my
hearing
overhead
the
stars
were
sliding
quickly
westward
and
something
mayhaps
the
particular
speed
to
which
they
had
attained
brought
home
to
me
for
the
first
time
a
keen
realization
of
the
knowledge
that
it
was
the
world
that
revolved
i
seemed
to
see
suddenly
the
world
a
vast
dark
mass
revolving
visibly
against
the
stars
the
dawn
and
the
sun
seemed
to
come
together
so
greatly
had
the
speed
of
the
increased
the
sun
drove
up
in
one
long
steady
curve
passed
its
highest
point
and
swept
down
into
the
western
sky
and
disappeared
i
was
scarcely
conscious
of
evening
so
brief
was
it
then
i
was
watching
the
flying
constellations
and
the
westward
hastening
moon
in
but
a
space
of
seconds
so
it
seemed
it
was
sliding
swiftly
downward
through
the
and
then
was
gone
and
almost
directly
came
the
morning
and
now
there
seemed
to
come
a
strange
acceleration
the
sun
made
one
clean
clear
sweep
through
the
sky
and
disappeared
behind
the
westward
horizon
and
the
night
came
and
went
with
a
like
haste
as
the
succeeding
day
opened
and
closed
upon
the
world
i
was
aware
of
a
sweat
of
snow
suddenly
upon
the
earth
the
night
came
and
almost
immediately
the
day
in
the
brief
leap
of
the
sun
i
saw
that
the
snow
had
vanished
and
then
once
more
it
was
night
thus
matters
were
and
even
after
the
many
incredible
things
that
i
have
seen
i
experienced
all
the
time
a
most
profound
awe
to
see
the
sun
rise
and
set
within
a
space
of
time
to
be
measured
by
seconds
to
watch
after
a
little
the
moon
leap
a
pale
and
ever
growing
orb
up
into
the
night
sky
and
glide
with
a
strange
swiftness
through
the
vast
arc
of
blue
and
presently
to
see
the
sun
follow
springing
out
of
the
eastern
sky
as
though
in
chase
and
then
again
the
night
with
the
swift
and
ghostly
passing
of
starry
constellations
was
all
too
much
to
view
believingly
yet
so
it
was
the
day
slipping
from
dawn
to
dusk
and
the
night
sliding
swiftly
into
day
ever
rapidly
and
more
rapidly
the
last
three
passages
of
the
sun
had
shown
me
a
earth
which
at
night
had
seemed
for
a
few
seconds
incredibly
weird
under
the
light
of
the
soaring
and
falling
moon
now
however
for
a
little
space
the
sky
was
hidden
by
a
sea
of
swaying
clouds
which
lightened
and
blackened
alternately
with
the
passage
of
day
and
night
the
clouds
rippled
and
vanished
and
there
was
once
more
before
me
the
vision
of
the
swiftly
leaping
sun
and
nights
that
came
and
went
like
shadows
faster
and
faster
spun
the
world
and
now
each
day
and
night
was
completed
within
the
space
of
but
a
few
seconds
and
still
the
speed
increased
it
was
a
little
later
that
i
noticed
that
the
sun
had
begun
to
have
the
suspicion
of
a
trail
of
fire
behind
it
this
was
due
evidently
to
the
speed
at
which
it
apparently
traversed
the
heavens
and
as
the
days
sped
each
one
quicker
than
the
last
the
sun
began
to
assume
the
appearance
of
a
vast
flaming
comet
flaring
across
the
sky
at
short
periodic
intervals
at
night
the
moon
presented
with
much
greater
truth
a
aspect
a
pale
and
singularly
clear
fast
traveling
shape
of
fire
trailing
streaks
of
cold
flame
the
stars
showed
now
merely
as
fine
hairs
of
fire
against
the
dark
once
i
turned
from
the
window
and
glanced
at
pepper
in
the
flash
of
a
day
i
saw
that
he
slept
quietly
and
i
moved
once
more
to
my
watching
the
sun
was
now
bursting
up
from
the
eastern
horizon
like
a
stupendous
rocket
seeming
to
occupy
no
more
than
a
second
or
two
in
hurling
from
east
to
west
i
could
no
longer
perceive
the
passage
of
clouds
across
the
sky
which
seemed
to
have
darkened
somewhat
the
brief
nights
appeared
to
have
lost
the
proper
darkness
of
night
so
that
the
fire
of
the
flying
stars
showed
but
dimly
as
the
speed
increased
the
sun
began
to
sway
very
slowly
in
the
sky
from
south
to
north
and
then
slowly
again
from
north
to
south
so
amid
a
strange
confusion
of
mind
the
hours
passed
all
this
while
had
pepper
slept
presently
feeling
lonely
and
distraught
i
called
to
him
softly
but
he
took
no
notice
again
i
called
raising
my
voice
slightly
still
he
moved
not
i
walked
over
to
where
he
lay
and
touched
him
with
my
foot
to
rouse
him
at
the
action
gentle
though
it
was
he
fell
to
pieces
that
is
what
happened
he
literally
and
actually
crumbled
into
a
mouldering
heap
of
bones
and
dust
for
the
space
of
perhaps
a
minute
i
stared
down
at
the
shapeless
heap
that
had
once
been
pepper
i
stood
feeling
stunned
what
can
have
happened
i
asked
myself
not
at
once
grasping
the
grim
significance
of
that
little
hill
of
ash
then
as
i
stirred
the
heap
with
my
foot
it
occurred
to
me
that
this
could
only
happen
in
a
great
space
of
time
years
and
years
outside
the
weaving
fluttering
light
held
the
world
inside
i
stood
trying
to
understand
what
it
meant
what
that
little
pile
of
dust
and
dry
bones
on
the
carpet
meant
but
i
could
not
think
coherently
i
glanced
away
the
room
and
now
for
the
first
time
noticed
how
dusty
and
old
the
place
looked
dust
and
dirt
everywhere
piled
in
little
heaps
in
the
corners
and
spread
about
upon
the
furniture
the
very
carpet
itself
was
invisible
beneath
a
coating
of
the
same
all
pervading
material
as
i
walked
little
clouds
of
the
stuff
rose
up
from
under
my
footsteps
and
assailed
my
nostrils
with
a
dry
bitter
odor
that
made
me
wheeze
huskily
suddenly
as
my
glance
fell
again
upon
pepper
remains
i
stood
still
and
gave
voice
to
my
confusion
questioning
aloud
whether
the
years
were
indeed
passing
whether
this
which
i
had
taken
to
be
a
form
of
vision
was
in
truth
a
reality
i
paused
a
new
thought
had
struck
me
quickly
but
with
steps
which
for
the
first
time
i
noticed
tottered
i
went
across
the
room
to
the
great
and
looked
in
it
was
too
covered
with
grime
to
give
back
any
reflection
and
with
trembling
hands
i
began
to
rub
off
the
dirt
presently
i
could
see
myself
the
thought
that
had
come
to
me
was
confirmed
instead
of
the
great
hale
man
who
scarcely
looked
fifty
i
was
looking
at
a
bent
decrepit
man
whose
shoulders
stooped
and
whose
face
was
wrinkled
with
the
years
of
a
century
the
hair
which
a
few
short
hours
ago
had
been
nearly
coal
black
was
now
silvery
white
only
the
eyes
were
bright
gradually
i
traced
in
that
ancient
man
a
faint
resemblance
to
my
self
of
other
days
i
turned
away
and
tottered
to
the
window
i
knew
now
that
i
was
old
and
the
knowledge
seemed
to
confirm
my
trembling
walk
for
a
little
space
i
stared
moodily
out
into
the
blurred
vista
of
changeful
landscape
even
in
that
short
time
a
year
passed
and
with
a
petulant
gesture
i
left
the
window
as
i
did
so
i
noticed
that
my
hand
shook
with
the
palsy
of
old
age
and
a
short
sob
choked
its
way
through
my
lips
for
a
little
while
i
paced
tremulously
between
the
window
and
the
table
my
gaze
wandering
hither
and
thither
uneasily
how
dilapidated
the
room
was
everywhere
lay
the
thick
dust
thick
sleepy
and
black
the
fender
was
a
shape
of
rust
the
chains
that
held
the
brass
had
rusted
through
long
ago
and
now
the
weights
lay
on
the
floor
beneath
themselves
two
cones
of
verdigris
as
i
glanced
about
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
see
the
very
furniture
of
the
room
rotting
and
decaying
before
my
eyes
nor
was
this
fancy
on
my
part
for
all
at
once
the
bookshelf
along
the
sidewall
collapsed
with
a
cracking
and
rending
of
rotten
wood
precipitating
its
contents
upon
the
floor
and
filling
the
room
with
a
smother
of
dusty
atoms
how
tired
i
felt
as
i
walked
it
seemed
that
i
could
hear
my
dry
joints
creak
and
crack
at
every
step
i
wondered
about
my
sister
was
she
dead
as
well
as
pepper
all
had
happened
so
quickly
and
suddenly
this
must
be
indeed
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
all
things
it
occurred
to
me
to
go
to
look
for
her
but
i
felt
too
weary
and
then
she
had
been
so
queer
about
these
happenings
of
late
of
late
i
repeated
the
words
and
laughed
feebly
mirthlessly
as
the
realization
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
i
spoke
of
a
time
half
a
century
gone
half
a
century
it
might
have
been
twice
as
long
i
moved
slowly
to
the
window
and
looked
out
once
more
across
the
world
i
can
best
describe
the
passage
of
day
and
night
at
this
period
as
a
sort
of
gigantic
ponderous
flicker
moment
by
moment
the
acceleration
of
time
continued
so
that
at
nights
now
i
saw
the
moon
only
as
a
swaying
trail
of
palish
fire
that
varied
from
a
mere
line
of
light
to
a
nebulous
path
and
then
dwindled
again
disappearing
periodically
the
flicker
of
the
days
and
nights
quickened
the
days
had
grown
perceptibly
darker
and
a
queer
quality
of
dusk
lay
as
it
were
in
the
atmosphere
the
nights
were
so
much
lighter
that
the
stars
were
scarcely
to
be
seen
saving
here
and
there
an
occasional
line
of
fire
that
seemed
to
sway
a
little
with
the
moon
quicker
and
ever
quicker
ran
the
flicker
of
day
and
night
and
suddenly
it
seemed
i
was
aware
that
the
flicker
had
died
out
and
instead
there
reigned
a
comparatively
steady
light
which
was
shed
upon
all
the
world
from
an
eternal
river
of
flame
that
swung
up
and
down
north
and
south
in
stupendous
mighty
swings
the
sky
was
now
grown
very
much
darker
and
there
was
in
the
blue
of
it
a
heavy
gloom
as
though
a
vast
blackness
peered
through
it
upon
the
earth
yet
there
was
in
it
also
a
strange
and
awful
clearness
and
emptiness
periodically
i
had
glimpses
of
a
ghostly
track
of
fire
that
swayed
thin
and
darkly
toward
the
vanished
and
reappeared
it
was
the
scarcely
visible
looking
out
at
the
landscape
i
was
conscious
again
of
a
blurring
sort
of
that
came
either
from
the
light
of
the
or
was
the
result
of
the
incredibly
rapid
changes
of
the
earth
surface
and
every
few
moments
so
it
seemed
the
snow
would
lie
suddenly
upon
the
world
and
vanish
as
abruptly
as
though
an
invisible
giant
a
white
sheet
off
and
on
the
earth
time
fled
and
the
weariness
that
was
mine
grew
insupportable
i
turned
from
the
window
and
walked
once
across
the
room
the
heavy
dust
deadening
the
sound
of
my
footsteps
each
step
that
i
took
seemed
a
greater
effort
than
the
one
before
an
intolerable
ache
knew
me
in
every
joint
and
limb
as
i
trod
my
way
with
a
weary
uncertainty
by
the
opposite
wall
i
came
to
a
weak
pause
and
wondered
dimly
what
was
my
intent
i
looked
to
my
left
and
saw
my
old
chair
the
thought
of
sitting
in
it
brought
a
faint
sense
of
comfort
to
my
bewildered
wretchedness
yet
because
i
was
so
weary
and
old
and
tired
i
would
scarcely
brace
my
mind
to
do
anything
but
stand
and
wish
myself
past
those
few
yards
i
rocked
as
i
stood
the
floor
even
seemed
a
place
for
rest
but
the
dust
lay
so
thick
and
sleepy
and
black
i
turned
with
a
great
effort
of
will
and
made
toward
my
chair
i
reached
it
with
a
groan
of
thankfulness
i
sat
down
everything
about
me
appeared
to
be
growing
dim
it
was
all
so
strange
and
unthought
of
last
night
i
was
a
comparatively
strong
though
elderly
man
and
now
only
a
few
hours
later
i
looked
at
the
little
that
had
once
been
pepper
hours
and
i
laughed
a
feeble
bitter
laugh
a
shrill
cackling
laugh
that
shocked
my
dimming
senses
for
a
while
i
must
have
dozed
then
i
opened
my
eyes
with
a
start
somewhere
across
the
room
there
had
been
a
muffled
noise
of
something
falling
i
looked
and
saw
vaguely
a
cloud
of
dust
hovering
above
a
pile
of
nearer
the
door
something
else
tumbled
with
a
crash
it
was
one
of
the
cupboards
but
i
was
tired
and
took
little
notice
i
closed
my
eyes
and
sat
there
in
a
state
of
drowsy
once
or
twice
as
though
coming
through
thick
mists
i
heard
noises
faintly
then
i
must
have
slept
the
awakening
i
awoke
with
a
start
for
a
moment
i
wondered
where
i
was
then
memory
came
to
me
the
room
was
still
lit
with
that
strange
light
light
i
felt
refreshed
and
the
tired
weary
ache
had
left
me
i
went
slowly
across
to
the
window
and
looked
out
overhead
the
river
of
flame
drove
up
and
down
north
and
south
in
a
dancing
of
fire
as
a
mighty
sleigh
in
the
loom
of
time
it
seemed
in
a
sudden
fancy
of
mine
to
be
beating
home
the
picks
of
the
years
for
so
vastly
had
the
passage
of
time
been
accelerated
that
there
was
no
longer
any
sense
of
the
sun
passing
from
east
to
west
the
only
apparent
movement
was
the
north
and
south
beat
of
the
that
had
become
so
swift
now
as
to
be
better
described
as
a
as
i
peered
out
there
came
to
me
a
sudden
inconsequent
memory
of
that
last
journey
among
the
outer
worlds
i
remembered
the
sudden
vision
that
had
come
to
me
as
i
neared
the
solar
system
of
the
fast
whirling
planets
about
the
sun
as
though
the
governing
quality
of
time
had
been
held
in
abeyance
and
the
machine
of
a
universe
allowed
to
run
down
an
eternity
in
a
few
moments
or
hours
the
memory
passed
along
with
a
but
partially
comprehended
suggestion
that
i
had
been
permitted
a
glimpse
into
further
time
spaces
i
stared
out
again
seemingly
at
the
quake
of
the
the
speed
seemed
to
increase
even
as
i
looked
several
lifetimes
came
and
went
as
i
watched
suddenly
it
struck
me
with
a
sort
of
grotesque
seriousness
that
i
was
still
alive
i
thought
of
pepper
and
wondered
how
it
was
that
i
had
not
followed
his
fate
he
had
reached
the
time
of
his
dying
and
had
passed
probably
through
sheer
length
of
years
and
here
was
i
alive
hundreds
of
thousands
of
centuries
after
my
rightful
period
of
years
for
a
time
i
mused
absently
i
stopped
suddenly
yesterday
there
was
no
yesterday
the
yesterday
of
which
i
spoke
had
been
swallowed
up
in
the
abyss
of
years
ages
gone
i
grew
dazed
with
much
thinking
presently
i
turned
from
the
window
and
glanced
the
room
it
seemed
different
strangely
utterly
different
then
i
knew
what
it
was
that
made
it
appear
so
strange
it
was
bare
there
was
not
a
piece
of
furniture
in
the
room
not
even
a
solitary
fitting
of
any
sort
gradually
my
amazement
went
as
i
remembered
that
this
was
but
the
inevitable
end
of
that
process
of
decay
which
i
had
witnessed
commencing
before
my
sleep
thousands
of
years
millions
of
years
over
the
floor
was
spread
a
deep
layer
of
dust
that
reached
half
way
up
to
the
it
had
grown
immeasurably
whilst
i
slept
and
represented
the
dust
of
untold
ages
undoubtedly
atoms
of
the
old
decayed
furniture
helped
to
swell
its
bulk
and
somewhere
among
it
all
mouldered
the
pepper
all
at
once
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
no
recollection
of
wading
through
all
that
dust
after
i
awoke
true
an
incredible
age
of
years
had
passed
since
i
approached
the
window
but
that
was
evidently
as
nothing
compared
with
the
countless
spaces
of
time
that
i
conceived
had
vanished
whilst
i
was
sleeping
i
remembered
now
that
i
had
fallen
asleep
sitting
in
my
old
chair
had
it
gone
i
glanced
toward
where
it
had
stood
of
course
there
was
no
chair
to
be
seen
i
could
not
satisfy
myself
whether
it
had
disappeared
after
my
waking
or
before
if
it
had
mouldered
under
me
surely
i
should
have
been
waked
by
the
collapse
then
i
remembered
that
the
thick
dust
which
covered
the
floor
would
have
been
sufficient
to
soften
my
fall
so
that
it
was
quite
possible
i
had
slept
upon
the
dust
for
a
million
years
or
more
as
these
thoughts
wandered
through
my
brain
i
glanced
again
casually
to
where
the
chair
had
stood
then
for
the
first
time
i
noticed
that
there
were
no
marks
in
the
dust
of
my
footprints
between
it
and
the
window
but
then
ages
of
years
had
passed
since
i
had
awaked
tens
of
thousands
of
years
my
look
rested
thoughtfully
again
upon
the
place
where
once
had
stood
my
chair
suddenly
i
passed
from
abstraction
to
intentness
for
there
in
its
standing
place
i
made
out
a
long
undulation
rounded
off
with
the
heavy
dust
yet
it
was
not
so
much
hidden
but
that
i
could
tell
what
had
caused
it
i
knew
and
shivered
at
the
knowledge
that
it
was
a
human
body
lying
there
beneath
the
place
where
i
had
slept
it
was
lying
on
its
right
side
its
back
turned
toward
me
i
could
make
out
and
trace
each
curve
and
outline
softened
and
moulded
as
it
were
in
the
black
dust
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
i
tried
to
account
for
its
presence
there
slowly
i
began
to
grow
bewildered
as
the
thought
came
to
me
that
it
lay
just
about
where
i
must
have
fallen
when
the
chair
collapsed
gradually
an
idea
began
to
form
itself
within
my
brain
a
thought
that
shook
my
spirit
it
seemed
hideous
and
insupportable
yet
it
grew
upon
me
steadily
until
it
became
a
conviction
the
body
under
that
coating
that
shroud
of
dust
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
my
own
dead
shell
i
did
not
attempt
to
prove
it
i
knew
it
now
and
wondered
i
had
not
known
it
all
along
i
was
a
bodiless
thing
awhile
i
stood
trying
to
adjust
my
thoughts
to
this
new
problem
in
time
how
many
thousands
of
years
i
know
not
i
attained
to
some
degree
of
quietude
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
pay
attention
to
what
was
transpiring
around
me
now
i
saw
that
the
elongated
mound
had
sunk
collapsed
level
with
the
rest
of
the
spreading
dust
and
fresh
atoms
impalpable
had
settled
above
that
mixture
of
which
the
aeons
had
ground
a
long
while
i
stood
turned
from
the
window
gradually
i
grew
more
collected
while
the
world
slipped
across
the
centuries
into
the
future
presently
i
began
a
survey
of
the
room
now
i
saw
that
time
was
beginning
its
destructive
work
even
on
this
strange
old
building
that
it
had
stood
through
all
the
years
was
it
seemed
to
me
proof
that
it
was
something
different
from
any
other
house
i
do
not
think
somehow
that
i
had
thought
of
its
decaying
though
why
i
could
not
have
said
it
was
not
until
i
had
meditated
upon
the
matter
for
some
considerable
time
that
i
fully
realized
that
the
extraordinary
space
of
time
through
which
it
had
stood
was
sufficient
to
have
utterly
pulverized
the
very
stones
of
which
it
was
built
had
they
been
taken
from
any
earthly
quarry
yes
it
was
undoubtedly
mouldering
now
all
the
plaster
had
gone
from
the
walls
even
as
the
woodwork
of
the
room
had
gone
many
ages
before
while
i
stood
in
contemplation
a
piece
of
glass
from
one
of
the
small
panes
dropped
with
a
dull
tap
amid
the
dust
upon
the
sill
behind
me
and
crumbled
into
a
little
heap
of
powder
as
i
turned
from
contemplating
it
i
saw
light
between
a
couple
of
the
stones
that
formed
the
outer
wall
evidently
the
mortar
was
falling
away
after
awhile
i
turned
once
more
to
the
window
and
peered
out
i
discovered
now
that
the
speed
of
time
had
become
enormous
the
lateral
quiver
of
the
had
grown
so
swift
as
to
cause
the
dancing
of
flame
to
merge
into
and
disappear
in
a
sheet
of
fire
that
covered
half
the
southern
sky
from
east
to
west
from
the
sky
i
glanced
down
to
the
gardens
they
were
just
a
blur
of
a
palish
dirty
green
i
had
a
feeling
that
they
stood
higher
than
in
the
old
days
a
feeling
that
they
were
nearer
my
window
as
though
they
had
risen
bodily
yet
they
were
still
a
long
way
below
me
for
the
rock
over
the
mouth
of
the
pit
on
which
this
house
stands
arches
up
to
a
great
height
it
was
later
that
i
noticed
a
change
in
the
constant
color
of
the
gardens
the
pale
dirty
green
was
growing
ever
paler
and
paler
toward
white
at
last
after
a
great
space
they
became
and
stayed
thus
for
a
very
long
time
finally
however
the
greyness
began
to
fade
even
as
had
the
green
into
a
dead
white
and
this
remained
constant
and
unchanged
and
by
this
i
knew
that
at
last
snow
lay
upon
all
the
northern
world
and
so
by
millions
of
years
time
winged
onward
through
eternity
to
the
end
the
end
of
which
in
the
days
i
had
thought
remotely
and
in
hazily
speculative
fashion
and
now
it
was
approaching
in
a
manner
of
which
none
had
ever
dreamed
i
recollect
that
about
this
time
i
began
to
have
a
lively
though
morbid
curiosity
as
to
what
would
happen
when
the
end
came
but
i
seemed
strangely
without
imaginings
all
this
while
the
steady
process
of
decay
was
continuing
the
few
remaining
pieces
of
glass
had
long
ago
vanished
and
every
now
and
then
a
soft
thud
and
a
little
cloud
of
rising
dust
would
tell
of
some
fragment
of
fallen
mortar
or
stone
i
looked
up
again
to
the
fiery
sheet
that
quaked
in
the
heavens
above
me
and
far
down
into
the
southern
sky
as
i
looked
the
impression
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
it
had
lost
some
of
its
first
brilliancy
that
it
was
duller
deeper
hued
i
glanced
down
once
more
to
the
blurred
white
of
the
worldscape
sometimes
my
look
returned
to
the
burning
sheet
of
dulling
flame
that
was
and
yet
hid
the
sun
at
times
i
glanced
behind
me
into
the
growing
dusk
of
the
great
silent
room
with
its
of
sleeping
dust
so
i
watched
through
the
fleeting
ages
lost
in
thoughts
and
wonderings
and
possessed
with
a
new
weariness
the
slowing
rotation
it
might
have
been
a
million
years
later
that
i
perceived
beyond
possibility
of
doubt
that
the
fiery
sheet
that
lit
the
world
was
indeed
darkening
another
vast
space
went
by
and
the
whole
enormous
flame
had
sunk
to
a
deep
copper
color
gradually
it
darkened
from
copper
to
and
from
this
at
times
to
a
deep
heavy
purplish
tint
with
in
it
a
strange
loom
of
blood
although
the
light
was
decreasing
i
could
perceive
no
diminishment
in
the
apparent
speed
of
the
sun
it
still
spread
itself
in
that
dazzling
veil
of
speed
the
world
so
much
of
it
as
i
could
see
had
assumed
a
dreadful
shade
of
gloom
as
though
in
very
deed
the
last
day
of
the
worlds
approached
the
sun
was
dying
of
that
there
could
be
little
doubt
and
still
the
earth
whirled
onward
through
space
and
all
the
aeons
at
this
time
i
remember
an
extraordinary
sense
of
bewilderment
took
me
i
found
myself
later
wandering
mentally
amid
an
odd
chaos
of
fragmentary
modern
theories
and
the
old
biblical
story
of
the
world
ending
then
for
the
first
time
there
flashed
across
me
the
memory
that
the
sun
with
its
system
of
planets
was
and
had
been
traveling
through
space
at
an
incredible
speed
abruptly
the
question
rose
for
a
very
great
time
i
pondered
this
matter
but
finally
with
a
certain
sense
of
the
futility
of
my
puzzlings
i
let
my
thoughts
wander
to
other
things
i
grew
to
wondering
how
much
longer
the
house
would
stand
also
i
queried
to
myself
whether
i
should
be
doomed
to
stay
bodiless
upon
the
earth
through
the
that
i
knew
was
coming
from
these
thoughts
i
fell
again
to
speculations
upon
the
possible
direction
of
the
sun
journey
through
space
and
so
another
great
while
passed
gradually
as
time
fled
i
began
to
feel
the
chill
of
a
great
winter
then
i
remembered
that
with
the
sun
dying
the
cold
must
be
necessarily
extraordinarily
intense
slowly
slowly
as
the
aeons
slipped
into
eternity
the
earth
sank
into
a
heavier
and
redder
gloom
the
dull
flame
in
the
firmament
took
on
a
deeper
tint
very
somber
and
turbid
then
at
last
it
was
borne
upon
me
that
there
was
a
change
the
fiery
gloomy
curtain
of
flame
that
hung
quaking
overhead
and
down
away
into
the
southern
sky
began
to
thin
and
contract
and
in
it
as
one
sees
the
fast
vibrations
of
a
jarred
i
saw
once
more
the
quivering
giddily
north
and
south
slowly
the
likeness
to
a
sheet
of
fire
disappeared
and
i
saw
plainly
the
slowing
beat
of
the
yet
even
then
the
speed
of
its
swing
was
inconceivably
swift
and
all
the
time
the
brightness
of
the
fiery
arc
grew
ever
duller
underneath
the
world
loomed
dimly
an
indistinct
ghostly
region
overhead
the
river
of
flame
swayed
slower
and
even
slower
until
at
last
it
swung
to
the
north
and
south
in
great
ponderous
beats
that
lasted
through
seconds
a
long
space
went
by
and
now
each
sway
of
the
great
belt
lasted
nigh
a
minute
so
that
after
a
great
while
i
ceased
to
distinguish
it
as
a
visible
movement
and
the
streaming
fire
ran
in
a
steady
river
of
dull
flame
across
the
sky
an
indefinite
period
passed
and
it
seemed
that
the
arc
of
fire
became
less
sharply
defined
it
appeared
to
me
to
grow
more
attenuated
and
i
thought
blackish
streaks
showed
occasionally
presently
as
i
watched
the
smooth
ceased
and
i
was
able
to
perceive
that
there
came
a
momentary
but
regular
darkening
of
the
world
this
grew
until
once
more
night
descended
in
short
but
periodic
intervals
upon
the
wearying
earth
longer
and
longer
became
the
nights
and
the
days
equaled
them
so
that
at
last
the
day
and
the
night
grew
to
the
duration
of
seconds
in
length
and
the
sun
showed
once
more
like
an
almost
invisible
colored
ball
within
the
glowing
mistiness
of
its
flight
corresponding
to
the
dark
lines
showing
at
times
in
its
trail
there
were
now
distinctly
to
be
seen
on
the
sun
itself
great
dark
belts
year
after
year
flashed
into
the
past
and
the
days
and
nights
spread
into
minutes
the
sun
had
ceased
to
have
the
appearance
of
a
tail
and
now
rose
and
set
a
tremendous
globe
of
a
glowing
hue
in
parts
ringed
with
bands
in
others
with
the
dusky
ones
that
i
have
already
mentioned
these
circles
both
red
and
black
were
of
varying
thicknesses
for
a
time
i
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
their
presence
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
scarcely
likely
that
the
sun
would
cool
evenly
all
over
and
that
these
markings
were
due
probably
to
differences
in
temperature
of
the
various
areas
the
red
representing
those
parts
where
the
heat
was
still
fervent
and
the
black
those
portions
which
were
already
comparatively
cool
it
struck
me
as
a
peculiar
thing
that
the
sun
should
cool
in
evenly
defined
rings
until
i
remembered
that
possibly
they
were
but
isolated
patches
to
which
the
enormous
rotatory
speed
of
the
sun
had
imparted
a
appearance
the
sun
itself
was
very
much
greater
than
the
sun
i
had
known
in
the
days
and
from
this
i
argued
that
it
was
considerably
nearer
at
nights
the
moon
still
showed
but
small
and
remote
and
the
light
she
reflected
was
so
dull
and
weak
that
she
seemed
little
more
than
the
small
dim
ghost
of
the
olden
moon
that
i
had
known
gradually
the
days
and
nights
lengthened
out
until
they
equaled
a
space
somewhat
less
than
one
of
the
hours
the
sun
rising
and
setting
like
a
great
ruddy
bronze
disk
crossed
with
bars
about
this
time
i
found
myself
able
once
more
to
see
the
gardens
with
clearness
for
the
world
had
now
grown
very
still
and
changeless
yet
i
am
not
correct
in
saying
for
there
were
no
gardens
nothing
that
i
knew
or
recognized
in
place
thereof
i
looked
out
upon
a
vast
plain
stretching
away
into
distance
a
little
to
my
left
there
was
a
low
range
of
hills
everywhere
there
was
a
uniform
white
covering
of
snow
in
places
rising
into
hummocks
and
ridges
it
was
only
now
that
i
recognized
how
really
great
had
been
the
snowfall
in
places
it
was
vastly
deep
as
was
witnessed
by
a
great
upleaping
hill
away
to
my
right
though
it
is
not
impossible
that
this
was
due
in
part
to
some
rise
in
the
surface
of
the
ground
strangely
enough
the
range
of
low
hills
to
my
left
already
mentioned
was
not
entirely
covered
with
the
universal
snow
instead
i
could
see
their
bare
dark
sides
showing
in
several
places
and
everywhere
and
always
there
reigned
an
incredible
and
desolation
the
immutable
awful
quiet
of
a
dying
world
all
this
time
the
days
and
nights
were
lengthening
perceptibly
already
each
day
occupied
maybe
some
two
hours
from
dawn
to
dusk
at
night
i
had
been
surprised
to
find
that
there
were
very
few
stars
overhead
and
these
small
though
of
an
extraordinary
brightness
which
i
attributed
to
the
peculiar
but
clear
blackness
of
the
nighttime
away
to
the
north
i
could
discern
a
nebulous
sort
of
mistiness
not
unlike
in
appearance
a
small
portion
of
the
milky
way
it
might
have
been
an
extremely
remote
or
the
thought
came
to
me
suddenly
perhaps
it
was
the
sidereal
universe
that
i
had
known
and
now
left
far
behind
forever
a
small
dimly
glowing
mist
of
stars
far
in
the
depths
of
space
still
the
days
and
nights
lengthened
slowly
each
time
the
sun
rose
duller
than
it
had
set
and
the
dark
belts
increased
in
breadth
about
this
time
there
happened
a
fresh
thing
the
sun
earth
and
sky
were
suddenly
darkened
and
apparently
blotted
out
for
a
brief
space
i
had
a
sense
a
certain
awareness
i
could
learn
little
by
sight
that
the
earth
was
enduring
a
very
great
fall
of
snow
then
in
an
instant
the
veil
that
had
obscured
everything
vanished
and
i
looked
out
once
more
a
marvelous
sight
met
my
gaze
the
hollow
in
which
this
house
with
its
gardens
stands
was
brimmed
with
snow
it
lipped
over
the
sill
of
my
window
everywhere
it
lay
a
great
level
stretch
of
white
which
caught
and
reflected
gloomily
the
somber
coppery
glows
of
the
dying
sun
the
world
had
become
a
shadowless
plain
from
horizon
to
horizon
i
glanced
up
at
the
sun
it
shone
with
an
extraordinary
dull
clearness
i
saw
it
now
as
one
who
until
then
had
seen
it
only
through
a
partially
obscuring
medium
all
about
it
the
sky
had
become
black
with
a
clear
deep
blackness
frightful
in
its
nearness
and
its
unmeasured
deep
and
its
utter
unfriendliness
for
a
great
time
i
looked
into
it
newly
and
shaken
and
fearful
it
was
so
near
had
i
been
a
child
i
might
have
expressed
some
of
my
sensation
and
distress
by
saying
that
the
sky
had
lost
its
roof
later
i
turned
and
peered
about
me
into
the
room
everywhere
it
was
covered
with
a
thin
shroud
of
the
white
i
could
see
it
but
dimly
by
reason
of
the
somber
light
that
now
lit
the
world
it
appeared
to
cling
to
the
ruined
walls
and
the
thick
soft
dust
of
the
years
that
covered
the
floor
was
nowhere
visible
the
snow
must
have
blown
in
through
the
open
framework
of
the
windows
yet
in
no
place
had
it
drifted
but
lay
everywhere
about
the
great
old
room
smooth
and
level
moreover
there
had
been
no
wind
these
many
thousand
years
but
there
was
the
snow
as
i
have
told
and
all
the
earth
was
silent
and
there
was
a
cold
such
as
no
living
man
can
ever
have
known
the
earth
was
now
illuminated
by
day
with
a
most
doleful
light
beyond
my
power
to
describe
it
seemed
as
though
i
looked
at
the
great
plain
through
the
medium
of
a
sea
it
was
evident
that
the
earth
rotatory
movement
was
departing
steadily
the
end
came
all
at
once
the
night
had
been
the
longest
yet
and
when
the
dying
sun
showed
at
last
above
the
world
edge
i
had
grown
so
wearied
of
the
dark
that
i
greeted
it
as
a
friend
it
rose
steadily
until
about
twenty
degrees
above
the
horizon
then
it
stopped
suddenly
and
after
a
strange
retrograde
movement
hung
motionless
a
great
shield
in
the
sky
only
the
circular
rim
of
the
sun
showed
bright
only
this
and
one
thin
streak
of
light
near
the
equator
gradually
even
this
thread
of
light
died
out
and
now
all
that
was
left
of
our
great
and
glorious
sun
was
a
vast
dead
disk
rimmed
with
a
thin
circle
of
light
the
green
star
the
world
was
held
in
a
savage
gloom
cold
and
intolerable
outside
all
was
quiet
quiet
from
the
dark
room
behind
me
came
the
occasional
soft
thud
of
falling
matter
fragments
of
rotting
stone
so
time
passed
and
night
grasped
the
world
wrapping
it
in
wrappings
of
impenetrable
blackness
there
was
no
as
we
know
it
even
the
few
straggling
stars
had
vanished
conclusively
i
might
have
been
in
a
shuttered
room
without
a
light
for
all
that
i
could
see
only
in
the
impalpableness
of
gloom
opposite
burnt
that
vast
encircling
hair
of
dull
fire
beyond
this
there
was
no
ray
in
all
the
vastitude
of
night
that
surrounded
me
save
that
far
in
the
north
that
soft
mistlike
glow
still
shone
silently
years
moved
on
what
period
of
time
passed
i
shall
never
know
it
seemed
to
me
waiting
there
that
eternities
came
and
went
stealthily
and
still
i
watched
i
could
see
only
the
glow
of
the
edge
at
times
for
now
it
had
commenced
to
come
and
go
lighting
up
a
while
and
again
becoming
extinguished
all
at
once
during
one
of
these
periods
of
life
a
sudden
flame
cut
across
the
night
a
quick
glare
that
lit
up
the
dead
earth
shortly
giving
me
a
glimpse
of
its
flat
lonesomeness
the
light
appeared
to
come
from
the
sun
shooting
out
from
somewhere
near
its
center
diagonally
a
moment
i
gazed
startled
then
the
leaping
flame
sank
and
the
gloom
fell
again
but
now
it
was
not
so
dark
and
the
sun
was
belted
by
a
thin
line
of
vivid
white
light
i
stared
intently
had
a
volcano
broken
out
on
the
sun
yet
i
negatived
the
thought
as
soon
as
formed
i
felt
that
the
light
had
been
far
too
intensely
white
and
large
for
such
a
cause
another
idea
there
was
that
suggested
itself
to
me
it
was
that
one
of
the
inner
planets
had
fallen
into
the
sun
becoming
incandescent
under
that
impact
this
theory
appealed
to
me
as
being
more
plausible
and
accounting
more
satisfactorily
for
the
extraordinary
size
and
brilliance
of
the
blaze
that
had
lit
up
the
dead
world
so
unexpectedly
full
of
interest
and
emotion
i
stared
across
the
darkness
at
that
line
of
white
fire
cutting
the
night
one
thing
it
told
to
me
unmistakably
the
sun
was
yet
rotating
at
an
enormous
speed
thus
i
knew
that
the
years
were
still
fleeting
at
an
incalculable
rate
though
so
far
as
the
earth
was
concerned
life
and
light
and
time
were
things
belonging
to
a
period
lost
in
the
long
gone
ages
after
that
one
burst
of
flame
the
light
had
shown
only
as
an
encircling
band
of
bright
fire
now
however
as
i
watched
it
began
slowly
to
sink
into
a
ruddy
tint
and
later
to
a
dark
color
much
as
the
sun
had
done
presently
it
sank
to
a
deeper
hue
and
in
a
still
further
space
of
time
it
began
to
fluctuate
having
periods
of
glowing
and
anon
dying
thus
after
a
great
while
it
disappeared
long
before
this
the
smoldering
edge
of
the
sun
had
deadened
into
blackness
and
so
in
that
supremely
future
time
the
world
dark
and
intensely
silent
rode
on
its
gloomy
orbit
around
the
ponderous
mass
of
the
dead
sun
my
thoughts
at
this
period
can
be
scarcely
described
at
first
they
were
chaotic
and
wanting
in
coherence
but
later
as
the
ages
came
and
went
my
soul
seemed
to
imbibe
the
very
essence
of
the
oppressive
solitude
and
dreariness
that
held
the
earth
with
this
feeling
there
came
a
wonderful
clearness
of
thought
and
i
realized
despairingly
that
the
world
might
wander
for
ever
through
that
enormous
night
for
a
while
the
unwholesome
idea
filled
me
with
a
sensation
of
overbearing
desolation
so
that
i
could
have
cried
like
a
child
in
time
however
this
feeling
grew
almost
insensibly
less
and
an
unreasoning
hope
possessed
me
patiently
i
waited
from
time
to
time
the
noise
of
dropping
particles
behind
in
the
room
came
dully
to
my
ears
once
i
heard
a
loud
crash
and
turned
instinctively
to
look
forgetting
for
the
moment
the
impenetrable
night
in
which
every
detail
was
submerged
in
a
while
my
gaze
sought
the
heavens
turning
unconsciously
toward
the
north
yes
the
nebulous
glow
still
showed
indeed
i
could
have
almost
imagined
that
it
looked
somewhat
plainer
for
a
long
time
i
kept
my
gaze
fixed
upon
it
feeling
in
my
lonely
soul
that
its
soft
haze
was
in
some
way
a
tie
with
the
past
strange
the
trifles
from
which
one
can
suck
comfort
and
yet
had
i
but
known
but
i
shall
come
to
that
in
its
proper
time
for
a
very
long
space
i
watched
without
experiencing
any
of
the
desire
for
sleep
that
would
so
soon
have
visited
me
in
the
days
how
i
should
have
welcomed
it
if
only
to
have
passed
the
time
away
from
my
perplexities
and
thoughts
several
times
the
comfortless
sound
of
some
great
piece
of
masonry
falling
disturbed
my
meditations
and
once
it
seemed
i
could
hear
whispering
in
the
room
behind
me
yet
it
was
utterly
useless
to
try
to
see
anything
such
blackness
as
existed
scarcely
can
be
conceived
it
was
palpable
and
hideously
brutal
to
the
sense
as
though
something
dead
pressed
up
against
me
something
soft
and
icily
cold
under
all
this
there
grew
up
within
my
mind
a
great
and
overwhelming
distress
of
uneasiness
that
left
me
but
to
drop
me
into
an
uncomfortable
brooding
i
felt
that
i
must
fight
against
it
and
presently
hoping
to
distract
my
thoughts
i
turned
to
the
window
and
looked
up
toward
the
north
in
search
of
the
nebulous
whiteness
which
still
i
believed
to
be
the
far
and
misty
glowing
of
the
universe
we
had
left
even
as
i
raised
my
eyes
i
was
thrilled
with
a
feeling
of
wonder
for
now
the
hazy
light
had
resolved
into
a
single
great
star
of
vivid
green
as
i
stared
astonished
the
thought
flashed
into
my
mind
that
the
earth
must
be
traveling
toward
the
star
not
away
as
i
had
imagined
next
that
it
could
not
be
the
universe
the
earth
had
left
but
possibly
an
outlying
star
belonging
to
some
vast
hidden
in
the
enormous
depths
of
space
with
a
sense
of
commingled
awe
and
curiosity
i
watched
it
wondering
what
new
thing
was
to
be
revealed
to
me
for
a
while
vague
thoughts
and
speculations
occupied
me
during
which
my
gaze
dwelt
insatiably
upon
that
one
spot
of
light
in
the
otherwise
pitlike
darkness
hope
grew
up
within
me
banishing
the
oppression
of
despair
that
had
seemed
to
stifle
me
wherever
the
earth
was
traveling
it
was
at
least
going
once
more
toward
the
realms
of
light
light
one
must
spend
an
eternity
wrapped
in
soundless
night
to
understand
the
full
horror
of
being
without
it
slowly
but
surely
the
star
grew
upon
my
vision
until
in
time
it
shone
as
brightly
as
had
the
planet
jupiter
in
the
days
with
increased
size
its
color
became
more
impressive
reminding
me
of
a
huge
emerald
scintillating
rays
of
fire
across
the
world
years
fled
away
in
silence
and
the
green
star
grew
into
a
great
splash
of
flame
in
the
sky
a
little
later
i
saw
a
thing
that
filled
me
with
amazement
it
was
the
ghostly
outline
of
a
vast
crescent
in
the
night
a
gigantic
new
moon
seeming
to
be
growing
out
of
the
surrounding
gloom
utterly
bemused
i
stared
at
it
it
appeared
to
be
quite
close
comparatively
and
i
puzzled
to
understand
how
the
earth
had
come
so
near
to
it
without
my
having
seen
it
before
the
light
thrown
by
the
star
grew
stronger
and
presently
i
was
aware
that
it
was
possible
to
see
the
earthscape
again
though
indistinctly
awhile
i
stared
trying
to
make
out
whether
i
could
distinguish
any
detail
of
the
world
surface
but
i
found
the
light
insufficient
in
a
little
i
gave
up
the
attempt
and
glanced
once
more
toward
the
star
even
in
the
short
space
that
my
attention
had
been
diverted
it
had
increased
considerably
and
seemed
now
to
my
bewildered
sight
about
a
quarter
of
the
size
of
the
full
moon
the
light
it
threw
was
extraordinarily
powerful
yet
its
color
was
so
abominably
unfamiliar
that
such
of
the
world
as
i
could
see
showed
unreal
more
as
though
i
looked
out
upon
a
landscape
of
shadow
than
aught
else
all
this
time
the
great
crescent
was
increasing
in
brightness
and
began
now
to
shine
with
a
perceptible
shade
of
green
steadily
the
star
increased
in
size
and
brilliancy
until
it
showed
fully
as
large
as
half
a
full
moon
and
as
it
grew
greater
and
brighter
so
did
the
vast
crescent
throw
out
more
and
more
light
though
of
an
ever
deepening
hue
of
green
under
the
combined
blaze
of
their
radiances
the
wilderness
that
stretched
before
me
became
steadily
more
visible
soon
i
seemed
able
to
stare
across
the
whole
world
which
now
appeared
beneath
the
strange
light
terrible
in
its
cold
and
awful
flat
dreariness
it
was
a
little
later
that
my
attention
was
drawn
to
the
fact
that
the
great
star
of
green
flame
was
slowly
sinking
out
of
the
north
toward
the
east
at
first
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
i
saw
aright
but
soon
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
so
gradually
it
sank
and
as
it
fell
the
vast
crescent
of
glowing
green
began
to
dwindle
and
dwindle
until
it
became
a
mere
arc
of
light
against
the
livid
colored
sky
later
it
vanished
disappearing
in
the
spot
from
which
i
had
seen
it
slowly
emerge
by
this
time
the
star
had
come
to
within
some
thirty
degrees
of
the
hidden
horizon
in
size
it
could
now
have
rivaled
the
moon
at
its
full
though
even
yet
i
could
not
distinguish
its
disk
this
fact
led
me
to
conceive
that
it
was
still
an
extraordinary
distance
away
and
this
being
so
i
knew
that
its
size
must
be
huge
beyond
the
conception
of
man
to
understand
or
imagine
suddenly
as
i
watched
the
lower
edge
of
the
star
vanished
cut
by
a
straight
dark
line
a
minute
or
a
century
passed
and
it
dipped
lower
until
the
half
of
it
had
disappeared
from
sight
far
away
out
on
the
great
plain
i
saw
a
monstrous
shadow
blotting
it
out
and
advancing
swiftly
only
a
third
of
the
star
was
visible
now
then
like
a
flash
the
solution
of
this
extraordinary
phenomenon
revealed
itself
to
me
the
star
was
sinking
behind
the
enormous
mass
of
the
dead
sun
or
rather
the
sun
obedient
to
its
attraction
was
rising
toward
it
with
the
earth
following
in
its
trail
as
these
thoughts
expanded
in
my
mind
the
star
vanished
being
completely
hidden
by
the
tremendous
bulk
of
the
sun
over
the
earth
there
fell
once
more
the
brooding
night
with
the
darkness
came
an
intolerable
feeling
of
loneliness
and
dread
for
the
first
time
i
thought
of
the
pit
and
its
inmates
after
that
there
rose
in
my
memory
the
still
more
terrible
thing
that
had
haunted
the
shores
of
the
sea
of
sleep
and
lurked
in
the
shadows
of
this
old
building
where
were
they
i
wondered
and
shivered
with
miserable
thoughts
for
a
time
fear
held
me
and
i
prayed
wildly
and
incoherently
for
some
ray
of
light
with
which
to
dispel
the
cold
blackness
that
enveloped
the
world
how
long
i
waited
it
is
impossible
to
say
certainly
for
a
very
great
period
then
all
at
once
i
saw
a
loom
of
light
shine
out
ahead
gradually
it
became
more
distinct
suddenly
a
ray
of
vivid
green
flashed
across
the
darkness
at
the
same
moment
i
saw
a
thin
line
of
livid
flame
far
in
the
night
an
instant
it
seemed
and
it
had
grown
into
a
great
clot
of
fire
beneath
which
the
world
lay
bathed
in
a
blaze
of
emerald
green
light
steadily
it
grew
until
presently
the
whole
of
the
green
star
had
come
into
sight
again
but
now
it
could
be
scarcely
called
a
star
for
it
had
increased
to
vast
proportions
being
incomparably
greater
than
the
sun
had
been
in
the
olden
time
then
as
i
stared
i
became
aware
that
i
could
see
the
edge
of
the
lifeless
sun
glowing
like
a
great
slowly
its
lighted
surface
broadened
out
to
me
until
half
of
its
diameter
was
visible
and
the
star
began
to
drop
away
on
my
right
time
passed
and
the
earth
moved
on
slowly
traversing
the
tremendous
face
of
the
dead
sun
gradually
as
the
earth
traveled
forward
the
star
fell
still
more
to
the
right
until
at
last
it
shone
on
the
back
of
the
house
sending
a
flood
of
broken
rays
in
through
the
walls
glancing
upward
i
saw
that
much
of
the
ceiling
had
vanished
enabling
me
to
see
that
the
upper
storeys
were
even
more
decayed
the
roof
had
evidently
gone
entirely
and
i
could
see
the
green
effulgence
of
the
starlight
shining
in
slantingly
the
end
of
the
solar
system
from
the
abutment
where
once
had
been
the
windows
through
which
i
had
watched
that
first
fatal
dawn
i
could
see
that
the
sun
was
hugely
greater
than
it
had
been
when
first
the
star
lit
the
world
so
great
was
it
that
its
lower
edge
seemed
almost
to
touch
the
far
horizon
even
as
i
watched
i
imagined
that
it
drew
closer
the
radiance
of
green
that
lit
the
frozen
earth
grew
steadily
brighter
thus
for
a
long
space
things
were
then
on
a
sudden
i
saw
that
the
sun
was
changing
shape
and
growing
smaller
just
as
the
moon
would
have
done
in
past
time
in
a
while
only
a
third
of
the
illuminated
part
was
turned
toward
the
earth
the
star
bore
away
on
the
left
gradually
as
the
world
moved
on
the
star
shone
upon
the
front
of
the
house
once
more
while
the
sun
showed
only
as
a
great
bow
of
green
fire
an
instant
it
seemed
and
the
sun
had
vanished
the
star
was
still
fully
visible
then
the
earth
moved
into
the
black
shadow
of
the
sun
and
all
was
night
night
black
starless
and
intolerable
filled
with
tumultuous
thoughts
i
watched
across
the
night
waiting
years
it
may
have
been
and
then
in
the
dark
house
behind
me
the
clotted
stillness
of
the
world
was
broken
i
seemed
to
hear
a
soft
padding
of
many
feet
and
a
faint
inarticulate
whisper
of
sound
grew
on
my
sense
i
looked
into
the
blackness
and
saw
a
multitude
of
eyes
as
i
stared
they
increased
and
appeared
to
come
toward
me
for
an
instant
i
stood
unable
to
move
then
a
hideous
rose
up
into
the
night
and
at
that
i
leapt
from
the
window
out
on
to
the
frozen
world
i
have
a
confused
notion
of
having
run
awhile
and
after
that
i
just
waited
waited
several
times
i
heard
shrieks
but
always
as
though
from
a
distance
except
for
these
sounds
i
had
no
idea
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
house
time
moved
onward
i
was
conscious
of
little
save
a
sensation
of
cold
and
hopelessness
and
fear
an
age
it
seemed
and
there
came
a
glow
that
told
of
the
coming
light
it
grew
tardily
then
with
a
loom
of
unearthly
glory
the
first
ray
from
the
green
star
struck
over
the
edge
of
the
dark
sun
and
lit
the
world
it
fell
upon
a
great
ruined
structure
some
two
hundred
yards
away
it
was
the
house
staring
i
saw
a
fearsome
sight
over
its
walls
crawled
a
legion
of
unholy
things
almost
covering
the
old
building
from
tottering
towers
to
base
i
could
see
them
plainly
they
were
the
the
world
moved
out
into
the
light
of
the
star
and
i
saw
that
now
it
seemed
to
stretch
across
a
quarter
of
the
heavens
the
glory
of
its
livid
light
was
so
tremendous
that
it
appeared
to
fill
the
sky
with
quivering
flames
then
i
saw
the
sun
it
was
so
close
that
half
of
its
diameter
lay
below
the
horizon
and
as
the
world
circled
across
its
face
it
seemed
to
tower
right
up
into
the
sky
a
stupendous
dome
of
emerald
colored
fire
from
time
to
time
i
glanced
toward
the
house
but
the
seemed
unaware
of
my
proximity
years
appeared
to
pass
slowly
the
earth
had
almost
reached
the
center
of
the
sun
disk
the
light
from
the
green
as
now
it
must
be
called
shone
through
the
interstices
that
gapped
the
mouldered
walls
of
the
old
house
giving
them
the
appearance
of
being
wrapped
in
green
flames
the
still
crawled
about
the
walls
suddenly
there
rose
a
loud
roar
of
and
up
from
the
center
of
the
roofless
house
shot
a
vast
column
of
flame
i
saw
the
little
twisted
towers
and
turrets
flash
into
fire
yet
still
preserving
their
twisted
crookedness
the
beams
of
the
green
sun
beat
upon
the
house
and
intermingled
with
its
lurid
glows
so
that
it
appeared
a
blazing
furnace
of
red
and
green
fire
fascinated
i
watched
until
an
overwhelming
sense
of
coming
danger
drew
my
attention
i
glanced
up
and
at
once
it
was
borne
upon
me
that
the
sun
was
closer
so
close
in
fact
that
it
seemed
to
overhang
the
world
then
i
know
not
how
i
was
caught
up
into
strange
heights
floating
like
a
bubble
in
the
awful
effulgence
far
below
me
i
saw
the
earth
with
the
burning
house
leaping
into
an
ever
growing
mountain
of
flame
about
it
the
ground
appeared
to
be
glowing
and
in
places
heavy
wreaths
of
yellow
smoke
ascended
from
the
earth
it
seemed
as
though
the
world
were
becoming
ignited
from
that
one
of
fire
faintly
i
could
see
the
they
appeared
quite
unharmed
then
the
ground
seemed
to
cave
in
suddenly
and
the
house
with
its
load
of
foul
creatures
disappeared
into
the
depths
of
the
earth
sending
a
strange
blood
colored
cloud
into
the
heights
i
remembered
the
hell
pit
under
the
house
in
a
while
i
looked
the
huge
bulk
of
the
sun
rose
high
above
me
the
distance
between
it
and
the
earth
grew
rapidly
less
suddenly
the
earth
appeared
to
shoot
forward
in
a
moment
it
had
traversed
the
space
between
it
and
the
sun
i
heard
no
sound
but
out
from
the
face
gushed
an
tongue
of
dazzling
flame
it
seemed
to
leap
almost
to
the
distant
green
sun
shearing
through
the
emerald
light
a
very
cataract
of
blinding
fire
it
reached
its
limit
and
sank
and
on
the
sun
glowed
a
vast
splash
of
burning
white
the
grave
of
the
earth
the
sun
was
very
close
to
me
now
presently
i
found
that
i
was
rising
higher
until
at
last
i
rode
above
it
in
the
emptiness
the
green
sun
was
now
so
huge
that
its
breadth
seemed
to
fill
up
all
the
sky
ahead
i
looked
down
and
noted
that
the
sun
was
passing
directly
beneath
me
a
year
may
have
gone
by
or
a
century
and
i
was
left
suspended
alone
the
sun
showed
far
in
front
a
black
circular
mass
against
the
molten
splendor
of
the
great
green
orb
near
one
edge
i
observed
that
a
lurid
glow
had
appeared
marking
the
place
where
the
earth
had
fallen
by
this
i
knew
that
the
sun
was
still
revolving
though
with
great
slowness
afar
to
my
right
i
seemed
to
catch
at
times
a
faint
glow
of
whitish
light
for
a
great
time
i
was
uncertain
whether
to
put
this
down
to
fancy
or
not
thus
for
a
while
i
stared
with
fresh
wonderings
until
at
last
i
knew
that
it
was
no
imaginary
thing
but
a
reality
it
grew
brighter
and
presently
there
slid
out
of
the
green
a
pale
globe
of
softest
white
it
came
nearer
and
i
saw
that
it
was
apparently
surrounded
by
a
robe
of
gently
glowing
clouds
time
passed
i
glanced
toward
the
diminishing
sun
it
showed
only
as
a
dark
blot
on
the
face
of
the
green
sun
as
i
watched
i
saw
it
grow
smaller
steadily
as
though
rushing
toward
the
superior
orb
at
an
immense
speed
intently
i
stared
what
would
happen
i
was
conscious
of
extraordinary
emotions
as
i
realized
that
it
would
strike
the
green
sun
it
grew
no
bigger
than
a
pea
and
i
looked
with
my
whole
soul
to
witness
the
final
end
of
our
system
that
system
which
had
borne
the
world
through
so
many
aeons
with
its
multitudinous
sorrows
and
joys
and
now
suddenly
something
crossed
my
vision
cutting
from
sight
all
vestige
of
the
spectacle
i
watched
with
such
what
happened
to
the
dead
sun
i
did
not
see
but
i
have
no
reason
in
the
light
of
that
which
i
saw
afterward
to
disbelieve
that
it
fell
into
the
strange
fire
of
the
green
sun
and
so
perished
and
then
suddenly
an
extraordinary
question
rose
in
my
mind
whether
this
stupendous
globe
of
green
fire
might
not
be
the
vast
central
sun
the
great
sun
which
our
universe
and
countless
others
revolve
i
felt
confused
i
thought
of
the
probable
end
of
the
dead
sun
and
another
suggestion
came
dumbly
do
the
dead
stars
make
the
green
sun
their
grave
the
idea
appealed
to
me
with
no
sense
of
grotesqueness
but
rather
as
something
both
possible
and
probable
the
celestial
globes
for
a
while
many
thoughts
crowded
my
mind
so
that
i
was
unable
to
do
aught
save
stare
blindly
before
me
i
seemed
whelmed
in
a
sea
of
doubt
and
wonder
and
sorrowful
remembrance
it
was
later
that
i
came
out
of
my
bewilderment
i
looked
about
dazedly
thus
i
saw
so
extraordinary
a
sight
that
for
a
while
i
could
scarcely
believe
i
was
not
still
wrapped
in
the
visionary
tumult
of
my
own
thoughts
out
of
the
reigning
green
had
grown
a
boundless
river
of
softly
shimmering
globes
each
one
enfolded
in
a
wondrous
fleece
of
pure
cloud
they
reached
both
above
and
below
me
to
an
unknown
distance
and
not
only
hid
the
shining
of
the
green
sun
but
supplied
in
place
thereof
a
tender
glow
of
light
that
suffused
itself
around
me
like
unto
nothing
i
have
ever
seen
before
or
since
in
a
little
i
noticed
that
there
was
about
these
spheres
a
sort
of
transparency
almost
as
though
they
were
formed
of
clouded
crystal
within
which
burned
a
radiance
gentle
and
subdued
they
moved
on
past
me
continually
floating
onward
at
no
great
speed
but
rather
as
though
they
had
eternity
before
them
a
great
while
i
watched
and
could
perceive
no
end
to
them
at
times
i
seemed
to
distinguish
faces
amid
the
cloudiness
but
strangely
indistinct
as
though
partly
real
and
partly
formed
of
the
mistiness
through
which
they
showed
for
a
long
time
i
waited
passively
with
a
sense
of
growing
content
i
had
no
longer
that
feeling
of
unutterable
loneliness
but
felt
rather
that
i
was
less
alone
than
i
had
been
for
kalpas
of
years
this
feeling
of
contentment
increased
so
that
i
would
have
been
satisfied
to
float
in
company
with
those
celestial
globules
forever
ages
slipped
by
and
i
saw
the
shadowy
faces
with
increased
frequency
also
with
greater
plainness
whether
this
was
due
to
my
soul
having
become
more
attuned
to
its
surroundings
i
can
not
tell
probably
it
was
so
but
however
this
may
be
i
am
assured
now
only
of
the
fact
that
i
became
steadily
more
conscious
of
a
new
mystery
about
me
telling
me
that
i
had
indeed
penetrated
within
the
borderland
of
some
region
some
subtle
intangible
place
or
form
of
existence
the
enormous
stream
of
luminous
spheres
continued
to
pass
me
at
an
unvarying
rate
countless
millions
and
still
they
came
showing
no
signs
of
ending
nor
even
diminishing
then
as
i
was
borne
silently
upon
the
unbuoying
ether
i
felt
a
sudden
irresistible
forward
movement
toward
one
of
the
passing
globes
an
instant
and
i
was
beside
it
then
i
slid
through
into
the
interior
without
experiencing
the
least
resistance
of
any
description
for
a
short
while
i
could
see
nothing
and
waited
curiously
all
at
once
i
became
aware
that
a
sound
broke
the
inconceivable
stillness
it
was
like
the
murmur
of
a
great
sea
at
calm
a
sea
breathing
in
its
sleep
gradually
the
mist
that
obscured
my
sight
began
to
thin
away
and
so
in
time
my
vision
dwelt
once
again
upon
the
silent
surface
of
the
sea
of
sleep
for
a
little
i
gazed
and
could
scarcely
believe
i
saw
aright
i
glanced
there
was
the
great
globe
of
pale
fire
swimming
as
i
had
seen
it
before
a
short
distance
above
the
dim
horizon
to
my
left
far
across
the
sea
i
discovered
presently
a
faint
line
as
of
thin
haze
which
i
guessed
to
be
the
shore
where
my
love
and
i
had
met
during
those
wonderful
periods
of
that
had
been
granted
to
me
in
the
old
earth
days
another
a
troubled
memory
came
to
me
of
the
formless
thing
that
had
haunted
the
shores
of
the
sea
of
sleep
the
guardian
of
that
silent
echoless
place
these
and
other
details
i
remembered
and
knew
without
doubt
that
i
was
looking
out
upon
that
same
sea
with
the
assurance
i
was
filled
with
an
overwhelming
feeling
of
surprise
and
joy
and
shaken
expectancy
conceiving
it
possible
that
i
was
about
to
see
my
love
again
intently
i
gazed
around
but
could
catch
no
sight
of
her
at
that
for
a
little
i
felt
hopeless
fervently
i
prayed
and
ever
peered
anxiously
how
still
was
the
sea
down
far
beneath
me
i
could
see
the
many
trails
of
changeful
fire
that
had
drawn
my
attention
formerly
vaguely
i
wondered
what
caused
them
also
i
remembered
that
i
had
intended
to
ask
my
dear
one
about
them
as
well
as
many
other
matters
and
i
had
been
forced
to
leave
her
before
the
half
that
i
had
wished
to
say
was
said
my
thoughts
came
back
with
a
leap
i
was
conscious
that
something
had
touched
me
i
turned
quickly
god
thou
wert
indeed
gracious
it
was
she
she
looked
up
into
my
eyes
with
an
eager
longing
and
i
looked
down
to
her
with
all
my
soul
i
should
like
to
have
held
her
but
the
glorious
purity
of
her
face
kept
me
afar
then
out
of
the
winding
mist
she
put
her
dear
arms
her
whisper
came
to
me
soft
as
the
rustle
of
a
passing
cloud
she
said
that
was
all
but
i
had
heard
and
in
a
moment
i
held
her
to
me
as
i
prayed
forever
in
a
little
she
spoke
of
many
things
and
i
listened
willingly
would
i
have
done
so
through
all
the
ages
that
are
to
come
at
times
i
whispered
back
and
my
whispers
brought
to
her
spirit
face
once
more
an
indescribably
delicate
tint
the
bloom
of
love
later
i
spoke
more
freely
and
to
each
word
she
listened
and
made
answer
delightfully
so
that
already
i
was
in
paradise
she
and
i
and
nothing
save
the
silent
spacious
void
to
see
us
and
only
the
quiet
waters
of
the
sea
of
sleep
to
hear
us
long
before
the
floating
multitude
of
spheres
had
vanished
into
nothingness
thus
we
looked
upon
the
face
of
the
slumberous
deeps
and
were
alone
alone
god
i
would
be
thus
alone
in
the
hereafter
and
yet
be
never
lonely
i
had
her
and
greater
than
this
she
had
me
aye
me
and
on
this
thought
and
some
others
i
hope
to
exist
through
the
few
remaining
years
that
may
yet
lie
between
us
the
dark
sun
how
long
our
souls
lay
in
the
arms
of
joy
i
can
not
say
but
all
at
once
i
was
waked
from
my
happiness
by
a
diminution
of
the
pale
and
gentle
light
that
lit
the
sea
of
sleep
i
turned
toward
the
huge
white
orb
with
a
premonition
of
coming
trouble
one
side
of
it
was
curving
inward
as
though
a
convex
black
shadow
were
sweeping
across
it
my
memory
went
back
it
was
thus
that
the
darkness
had
come
before
our
last
parting
i
turned
toward
my
love
inquiringly
with
a
sudden
knowledge
of
woe
i
noticed
how
wan
and
unreal
she
had
grown
even
in
that
brief
space
her
voice
seemed
to
come
to
me
from
a
distance
the
touch
of
her
hands
was
no
more
than
the
gentle
pressure
of
a
summer
wind
and
grew
less
perceptible
already
quite
half
of
the
immense
globe
was
shrouded
a
feeling
of
desperation
seized
me
was
she
about
to
leave
me
would
she
have
to
go
as
she
had
gone
before
i
questioned
her
anxiously
frightenedly
and
she
nestling
closer
explained
in
that
strange
faraway
voice
that
it
was
imperative
she
should
leave
me
before
the
sun
of
darkness
as
she
termed
it
blotted
out
the
light
at
this
confirmation
of
my
fears
i
was
overcome
with
despair
and
could
only
look
voicelessly
across
the
quiet
plains
of
the
silent
sea
how
swiftly
the
darkness
spread
across
the
face
of
the
white
orb
yet
in
reality
the
time
must
have
been
long
beyond
human
comprehension
at
last
only
a
crescent
of
pale
fire
lit
the
now
dim
sea
of
sleep
all
this
while
she
had
held
me
but
with
so
soft
a
caress
that
i
had
been
scarcely
conscious
of
it
we
waited
there
together
she
and
i
speechless
for
very
sorrow
in
the
dimming
light
her
face
showed
shadowy
blending
into
the
dusky
mistiness
that
encircled
us
then
when
a
thin
curved
line
of
soft
light
was
all
that
lit
the
sea
she
released
me
pushing
me
from
her
tenderly
her
voice
sounded
in
my
ears
may
not
stay
longer
dear
one
it
ended
in
a
sob
she
seemed
to
float
away
from
me
and
became
invisible
her
voice
came
to
me
out
of
the
shadows
faintly
apparently
from
a
great
distance
little
while
it
died
away
remotely
in
a
breath
the
sea
of
sleep
darkened
into
night
far
to
my
left
i
seemed
to
see
for
a
brief
instant
a
soft
glow
it
vanished
and
in
the
same
moment
i
became
aware
that
i
was
no
longer
above
the
still
sea
but
once
more
suspended
in
infinite
space
with
the
green
sun
now
eclipsed
by
a
vast
dark
sphere
before
me
utterly
bewildered
i
stared
almost
unseeingly
at
the
ring
of
green
flames
leaping
above
the
dark
edge
even
in
the
chaos
of
my
thoughts
i
wondered
dully
at
their
extraordinary
shapes
a
multitude
of
questions
assailed
me
i
thought
more
of
her
i
had
so
lately
seen
than
of
the
sight
before
me
my
grief
and
thoughts
of
the
future
filled
me
was
i
doomed
to
be
separated
from
her
always
even
in
the
old
she
had
been
mine
only
for
a
little
while
then
she
had
left
me
as
i
thought
forever
since
then
i
had
seen
her
but
these
times
upon
the
sea
of
sleep
a
feeling
of
fierce
resentment
filled
me
and
miserable
questionings
why
could
i
not
have
gone
with
my
love
what
reason
to
keep
us
apart
why
had
i
to
wait
alone
while
she
slumbered
through
the
years
on
the
still
bosom
of
the
sea
of
sleep
the
sea
of
sleep
my
thoughts
turned
inconsequently
out
of
their
channel
of
bitterness
to
fresh
desperate
questionings
where
was
it
where
was
it
i
seemed
to
have
but
just
parted
from
my
love
upon
its
quiet
surface
and
it
had
gone
utterly
it
could
not
be
far
away
and
the
white
orb
which
i
had
seen
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
the
sun
of
darkness
my
sight
dwelt
upon
the
green
sun
eclipsed
what
had
eclipsed
it
was
there
a
vast
dead
star
circling
it
was
the
sun
as
i
had
come
to
regard
it
a
double
star
the
thought
had
come
almost
unbidden
yet
why
should
it
not
be
so
my
thoughts
went
back
to
the
white
orb
strange
that
it
should
have
been
i
stopped
an
idea
had
come
suddenly
the
white
orb
and
the
green
sun
were
they
one
and
the
same
my
imagination
wandered
backward
and
i
remembered
the
luminous
globe
to
which
i
had
been
so
unaccountably
attracted
it
was
curious
that
i
should
have
forgotten
it
even
momentarily
where
were
the
others
i
reverted
again
to
the
globe
i
had
entered
i
thought
for
a
time
and
matters
became
clearer
i
conceived
that
by
entering
that
impalpable
globule
i
had
passed
at
once
into
some
further
and
until
then
invisible
dimension
there
the
green
sun
was
still
visible
but
as
a
stupendous
sphere
of
pale
white
light
almost
as
though
its
ghost
showed
and
not
its
material
part
a
long
time
i
mused
on
the
subject
i
remembered
how
on
entering
the
sphere
i
had
immediately
lost
all
sight
of
the
others
for
a
still
further
period
i
continued
to
revolve
the
different
details
in
my
mind
in
a
while
my
thoughts
turned
to
other
things
i
came
more
into
the
present
and
began
to
look
about
me
seeingly
for
the
first
time
i
perceived
that
innumerable
rays
of
a
subtle
violet
hue
pierced
the
strange
in
all
directions
they
radiated
from
the
fiery
rim
of
the
green
sun
they
seemed
to
grow
upon
my
vision
so
that
in
a
little
i
saw
that
they
were
countless
the
night
was
filled
with
them
spreading
outward
from
the
green
sun
i
concluded
that
i
was
enabled
to
see
them
by
reason
of
the
sun
glory
being
cut
off
by
the
eclipse
they
reached
right
out
into
space
and
vanished
gradually
as
i
looked
i
became
aware
that
fine
points
of
intensely
brilliant
light
traversed
the
rays
many
of
them
seemed
to
travel
from
the
green
sun
into
distance
others
came
out
of
the
void
toward
the
sun
but
one
and
all
each
kept
strictly
to
the
ray
in
which
it
traveled
their
speed
was
inconceivably
great
and
it
was
only
when
they
neared
the
green
sun
or
as
they
left
it
that
i
could
see
them
as
separate
specks
of
light
further
from
the
sun
they
became
thin
lines
of
vivid
fire
within
the
violet
the
discovery
of
these
rays
and
the
moving
sparks
interested
me
extraordinarily
to
where
did
they
lead
in
such
countless
profusion
i
thought
of
the
worlds
in
space
and
those
sparks
messengers
possibly
the
idea
was
fantastic
but
i
was
not
conscious
of
its
being
so
messengers
messengers
from
the
central
sun
an
idea
evolved
itself
slowly
was
the
green
sun
the
abode
of
some
vast
intelligence
the
thought
was
bewildering
visions
of
the
unnameable
rose
vaguely
had
i
indeed
come
upon
the
of
the
eternal
for
a
time
i
repelled
the
thought
dumbly
it
was
too
stupendous
yet
huge
vague
thoughts
had
birth
within
me
i
felt
suddenly
terribly
naked
and
an
awful
nearness
shook
me
and
heaven
was
that
an
illusion
my
thoughts
came
and
went
erratically
the
sea
of
sleep
and
she
heaven
i
came
back
with
a
bound
to
the
present
somewhere
out
of
the
void
behind
me
there
rushed
an
immense
dark
body
huge
and
silent
it
was
a
dead
star
hurling
onward
to
the
burying
place
of
the
stars
it
drove
between
me
and
the
central
suns
blotting
them
out
from
my
vision
and
plunging
me
into
an
impenetrable
night
an
age
and
i
saw
again
the
violet
rays
a
great
while
later
aeons
it
must
have
been
a
circular
glow
grew
in
the
sky
ahead
and
i
saw
the
edge
of
the
receding
star
show
darkly
against
it
thus
i
knew
that
it
was
nearing
the
central
suns
presently
i
saw
the
bright
ring
of
the
green
sun
show
plainly
against
the
night
the
star
had
passed
into
the
shadow
of
the
dead
sun
after
that
i
just
waited
the
strange
years
went
slowly
and
ever
i
watched
intently
thing
i
had
expected
came
at
last
suddenly
awfully
a
vast
flare
of
dazzling
light
a
streaming
burst
of
white
flame
across
the
dark
void
for
an
indefinite
while
it
soared
outward
a
gigantic
mushroom
of
fire
it
ceased
to
grow
then
as
time
went
by
it
began
to
sink
backward
slowly
i
saw
now
that
it
came
from
a
huge
glowing
spot
near
the
center
of
the
dark
sun
mighty
flames
still
soared
outward
from
this
yet
spite
of
its
size
the
grave
of
the
star
was
no
more
than
the
shining
of
jupiter
upon
the
face
of
an
ocean
when
compared
with
the
inconceivable
mass
of
the
dead
sun
i
may
remark
here
once
more
that
no
words
will
ever
convey
to
the
imagination
the
enormous
bulk
of
the
two
central
suns
the
dark
nebula
years
melted
into
the
past
centuries
aeons
the
light
of
the
incandescent
star
sank
to
a
furious
red
it
was
later
that
i
saw
the
dark
nebula
at
first
an
impalpable
cloud
away
to
my
right
it
grew
steadily
to
a
clot
of
blackness
in
the
night
how
long
i
watched
it
is
impossible
to
say
for
time
as
we
count
it
was
a
thing
of
the
past
it
came
closer
a
shapeless
monstrosity
of
darkness
tremendous
it
seemed
to
slip
across
the
night
sleepily
a
very
slowly
it
slid
nearer
and
passed
into
the
void
between
me
and
the
central
suns
it
was
as
though
a
curtain
had
been
drawn
before
my
vision
a
strange
tremor
of
fear
took
me
and
a
fresh
sense
of
wonder
the
green
twilight
that
had
reigned
for
so
many
millions
of
years
had
now
given
place
to
impenetrable
gloom
motionless
i
peered
about
me
a
century
fled
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
detected
occasional
dull
glows
of
red
passing
me
at
intervals
earnestly
i
gazed
and
presently
seemed
to
see
circular
masses
that
showed
muddily
red
within
the
clouded
blackness
they
appeared
to
be
growing
out
of
the
nebulous
murk
awhile
and
they
became
plainer
to
my
accustomed
vision
i
could
see
them
now
with
a
fair
amount
of
distinctness
spheres
similar
in
size
to
the
luminous
globes
that
i
had
seen
so
long
previously
they
floated
past
me
continually
gradually
a
peculiar
uneasiness
seized
me
i
became
aware
of
a
growing
feeling
of
repugnance
and
dread
it
was
directed
against
those
passing
orbs
and
seemed
born
of
intuitive
knowledge
rather
than
of
any
real
cause
or
reason
some
of
the
passing
globes
were
brighter
than
others
and
it
was
from
one
of
these
that
a
face
looked
suddenly
a
face
human
in
its
outline
but
so
tortured
with
woe
that
i
stared
aghast
i
had
not
thought
there
was
such
sorrow
as
i
saw
there
i
was
conscious
of
an
added
sense
of
pain
on
perceiving
that
the
eyes
which
glared
so
wildly
were
sightless
a
while
longer
i
saw
it
then
it
had
passed
on
into
the
surrounding
gloom
after
this
i
saw
others
all
wearing
that
look
of
hopeless
sorrow
and
blind
a
long
time
went
by
and
i
became
aware
that
i
was
nearer
to
the
orbs
than
i
had
been
at
this
i
grew
uneasy
though
i
was
less
in
fear
of
those
strange
globules
than
i
had
been
before
seeing
their
sorrowful
inhabitants
for
sympathy
had
tempered
my
fear
later
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
i
was
being
carried
closer
to
the
red
spheres
and
presently
i
floated
among
them
in
awhile
i
perceived
one
bearing
down
upon
me
i
was
helpless
to
move
from
its
path
in
a
minute
it
seemed
it
was
upon
me
and
i
was
submerged
in
a
deep
red
mist
this
cleared
and
i
stared
confusedly
across
the
immense
breadth
of
the
plain
of
silence
it
appeared
just
as
i
had
first
seen
it
i
was
moving
forward
steadily
across
its
surface
away
ahead
shone
the
vast
ring
that
lit
the
place
all
around
was
spread
the
extraordinary
desolation
of
stillness
that
had
so
impressed
me
during
my
previous
wanderings
across
its
starkness
presently
i
saw
rising
up
into
the
ruddy
gloom
the
distant
peaks
of
the
mighty
amphitheatre
of
mountains
where
untold
ages
before
i
had
been
shown
my
first
glimpse
of
the
terrors
that
underlie
many
things
and
where
vast
and
silent
watched
by
a
thousand
mute
gods
stands
the
replica
of
this
house
of
mysteries
this
house
that
i
had
seen
swallowed
up
in
that
ere
the
earth
had
kissed
the
sun
and
vanished
for
ever
though
i
could
see
the
crests
of
the
yet
it
was
a
great
while
before
their
lower
portions
became
visible
possibly
this
was
due
to
the
strange
ruddy
haze
that
seemed
to
cling
to
the
surface
of
the
plain
however
be
this
as
it
may
i
saw
them
at
last
in
a
still
further
space
of
time
i
had
come
so
close
to
the
mountains
that
they
appeared
to
overhang
me
presently
i
saw
the
great
rift
open
before
me
and
i
drifted
into
it
without
volition
on
my
part
later
i
came
out
upon
the
breadth
of
the
enormous
arena
there
at
an
apparent
distance
of
some
five
miles
stood
the
house
huge
monstrous
and
silent
lying
in
the
very
center
of
that
stupendous
amphitheatre
so
far
as
i
could
see
it
had
not
altered
in
any
way
but
looked
as
though
it
were
only
yesterday
that
i
had
seen
it
around
the
grim
dark
mountains
frowned
down
upon
me
from
their
lofty
silences
far
to
my
right
away
up
among
inaccessible
peaks
loomed
the
enormous
bulk
of
the
great
higher
i
saw
the
hideous
form
of
the
dread
goddess
rising
up
through
the
red
gloom
thousands
of
fathoms
above
me
to
the
left
i
made
out
the
monstrous
grey
and
inscrutable
further
off
reclining
on
its
lofty
ledge
the
livid
showed
a
splash
of
sinister
color
among
the
dark
mountains
slowly
i
moved
out
across
the
great
arena
floating
as
i
went
i
made
out
the
dim
forms
of
many
of
the
other
lurking
horrors
that
peopled
those
supreme
heights
gradually
i
neared
the
house
and
my
thoughts
flashed
back
across
the
abyss
of
years
i
remembered
the
dread
specter
of
the
place
a
short
while
passed
and
i
saw
that
i
was
being
wafted
directly
toward
the
enormous
mass
of
that
silent
building
about
this
time
i
became
aware
in
an
indifferent
sort
of
way
of
a
growing
sense
of
numbness
that
robbed
me
of
the
fear
which
i
should
otherwise
have
felt
on
approaching
that
awesome
pile
as
it
was
i
viewed
it
calmly
much
as
a
man
views
calamity
through
the
haze
of
his
tobacco
smoke
in
a
little
while
i
had
come
so
close
to
the
house
as
to
be
able
to
distinguish
many
of
the
details
about
it
the
longer
i
looked
the
more
was
i
confirmed
in
my
impressions
of
its
entire
similitude
to
this
strange
house
save
in
its
enormous
size
i
could
find
nothing
unlike
suddenly
as
i
stared
a
great
feeling
of
amazement
filled
me
i
had
come
opposite
to
that
part
where
the
outer
door
leading
into
the
study
is
situated
there
lying
right
across
the
threshold
lay
a
great
length
of
coping
stone
identical
save
in
size
and
color
with
the
piece
i
had
dislodged
in
my
fight
with
the
i
floated
nearer
and
my
astonishment
increased
as
i
noted
that
the
door
was
broken
partly
from
its
hinges
precisely
in
the
manner
that
my
study
door
had
been
forced
inward
by
the
assaults
of
the
the
sight
started
a
train
of
thoughts
and
i
began
to
trace
dimly
that
the
attack
on
this
house
might
have
a
far
deeper
significance
than
i
had
hitherto
imagined
i
remembered
how
long
ago
in
the
old
i
had
half
suspected
that
in
some
unexplainable
manner
this
house
in
which
i
live
was
to
use
a
recognized
term
with
that
other
tremendous
structure
away
in
the
midst
of
that
incomparable
plain
now
however
it
began
to
be
borne
upon
me
that
i
had
but
vaguely
conceived
what
the
realization
of
my
suspicion
meant
i
began
to
understand
with
a
more
than
human
clearness
that
the
attack
i
had
repelled
was
in
some
extraordinary
manner
connected
with
an
attack
upon
that
strange
edifice
with
a
curious
inconsequence
my
thoughts
abruptly
left
the
matter
to
dwell
wonderingly
upon
the
peculiar
material
out
of
which
the
house
was
constructed
it
was
as
i
have
mentioned
earlier
of
a
deep
green
color
yet
now
that
i
had
come
so
close
to
it
i
perceived
that
it
fluctuated
at
times
though
slightly
glowing
and
fading
much
as
do
the
fumes
of
phosphorus
when
rubbed
upon
the
hand
in
the
dark
presently
my
attention
was
distracted
from
this
by
coming
to
the
great
entrance
here
for
the
first
time
i
was
afraid
for
all
in
a
moment
the
huge
doors
swung
back
and
i
drifted
in
between
them
helplessly
inside
all
was
blackness
impalpable
in
an
instant
i
had
crossed
the
threshold
and
the
great
doors
closed
silently
shutting
me
in
that
lightless
place
for
a
while
i
seemed
to
hang
motionless
suspended
amid
the
darkness
then
i
became
conscious
that
i
was
moving
again
where
i
could
not
tell
suddenly
far
down
beneath
me
i
seemed
to
hear
a
murmurous
noise
of
it
sank
away
and
the
succeeding
silence
appeared
clogged
with
horror
then
a
door
opened
somewhere
ahead
a
white
haze
of
light
filtered
through
and
i
floated
slowly
into
a
room
that
seemed
strangely
familiar
all
at
once
there
came
a
bewildering
screaming
noise
that
deafened
me
i
saw
a
blurred
vista
of
visions
flaming
before
my
sight
my
senses
were
dazed
through
the
space
of
an
eternal
moment
then
my
power
of
seeing
came
back
to
me
the
dizzy
hazy
feeling
passed
and
i
saw
clearly
pepper
i
was
seated
in
my
chair
back
again
in
this
old
study
my
glance
wandered
the
room
for
a
minute
it
had
a
strange
quivery
appearance
unreal
and
unsubstantial
this
disappeared
and
i
saw
that
nothing
was
altered
in
any
way
i
looked
toward
the
end
window
the
blind
was
up
i
rose
to
my
feet
shakily
as
i
did
so
a
slight
noise
in
the
direction
of
the
door
attracted
my
attention
i
glanced
toward
it
for
a
short
instant
it
appeared
to
me
that
it
was
being
closed
gently
i
stared
and
saw
that
i
must
have
been
mistaken
it
seemed
closely
shut
with
a
succession
of
efforts
i
trod
my
way
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
sun
was
just
rising
lighting
up
the
tangled
wilderness
of
gardens
for
perhaps
a
minute
i
stood
and
stared
i
passed
my
hand
confusedly
across
my
forehead
presently
amid
the
chaos
of
my
senses
a
sudden
thought
came
to
me
i
turned
quickly
and
called
to
pepper
there
was
no
answer
and
i
stumbled
across
the
room
in
a
quick
access
of
fear
as
i
went
i
tried
to
frame
his
name
but
my
lips
were
numb
i
reached
the
table
and
stooped
down
to
him
with
a
catching
at
my
heart
he
was
lying
in
the
shadow
of
the
table
and
i
had
not
been
able
to
see
him
distinctly
from
the
window
now
as
i
stooped
i
took
my
breath
shortly
there
was
no
pepper
instead
i
was
reaching
toward
an
elongated
little
heap
of
grey
ashlike
dust
i
must
have
remained
in
that
position
for
some
minutes
i
was
dazed
stunned
pepper
had
really
passed
into
the
land
of
shadows
the
footsteps
in
the
garden
pepper
is
dead
even
now
at
times
i
seem
scarcely
able
to
realize
that
this
is
so
it
is
many
weeks
since
i
came
back
from
that
strange
and
terrible
journey
through
space
and
time
sometimes
in
my
sleep
i
dream
about
it
and
go
through
in
imagination
the
whole
of
that
fearsome
happening
when
i
wake
my
thoughts
dwell
upon
it
that
sun
those
suns
were
they
indeed
the
great
central
suns
which
the
whole
universe
of
the
unknown
heavens
revolves
who
shall
say
and
the
bright
globules
floating
forever
in
the
light
of
the
green
sun
and
the
sea
of
sleep
on
which
they
float
how
unbelievable
it
all
is
if
it
were
not
for
pepper
i
should
even
after
the
many
extraordinary
things
that
i
have
witnessed
be
inclined
to
imagine
that
it
was
but
a
gigantic
dream
then
there
is
that
dreadful
dark
nebula
with
its
multitudes
of
red
spheres
moving
always
within
the
shadow
of
the
dark
sun
sweeping
along
on
its
stupendous
orbit
wrapped
eternally
in
gloom
and
the
faces
that
peered
out
at
me
god
do
they
and
does
such
a
thing
really
exist
there
is
still
that
little
heap
of
grey
ash
on
my
study
floor
i
will
not
have
it
touched
at
times
when
i
am
calmer
i
have
wondered
what
became
of
the
outer
planets
of
the
solar
system
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
they
may
have
broken
loose
from
the
sun
attraction
and
whirled
away
into
space
this
is
of
course
only
a
surmise
there
are
so
many
things
about
which
i
wonder
now
that
i
am
writing
let
me
record
that
i
am
certain
there
is
something
horrible
about
to
happen
last
night
a
thing
occurred
which
has
filled
me
with
an
even
greater
terror
than
did
the
pit
fear
i
will
write
it
down
now
and
if
anything
more
happens
endeavor
to
make
a
note
of
it
at
once
i
have
a
feeling
that
there
is
more
in
this
last
affair
than
in
all
those
others
i
am
shaky
and
nervous
even
now
as
i
write
somehow
i
think
death
is
not
very
far
away
not
that
i
fear
death
as
death
is
understood
yet
there
is
that
in
the
air
which
bids
me
fear
an
intangible
cold
horror
i
felt
it
last
night
it
was
thus
last
night
i
was
sitting
here
in
my
study
writing
the
door
leading
into
the
garden
was
half
open
at
times
the
metallic
rattle
of
a
chain
sounded
faintly
it
belongs
to
the
dog
i
have
bought
since
pepper
death
i
will
not
have
him
in
the
house
not
after
pepper
still
i
have
felt
it
better
to
have
a
dog
about
the
place
they
are
wonderful
creatures
i
was
much
engrossed
in
my
work
and
the
time
passed
quickly
suddenly
i
heard
a
soft
noise
on
the
path
outside
in
the
garden
pad
pad
pad
it
went
with
a
stealthy
curious
sound
i
sat
upright
with
a
quick
movement
and
looked
out
through
the
opened
door
again
the
noise
came
pad
pad
pad
it
appeared
to
be
approaching
with
a
slight
feeling
of
nervousness
i
stared
into
the
gardens
but
the
night
hid
everything
then
the
dog
gave
a
long
howl
and
i
started
for
a
minute
perhaps
i
peered
intently
but
could
hear
nothing
after
a
little
i
picked
up
the
pen
which
i
had
laid
down
and
recommenced
my
work
the
nervous
feeling
had
gone
for
i
imagined
that
the
sound
i
had
heard
was
nothing
more
than
the
dog
walking
his
kennel
at
the
length
of
his
chain
a
quarter
of
an
hour
may
have
passed
then
all
at
once
the
dog
howled
again
and
with
such
a
plaintively
sorrowful
note
that
i
jumped
to
my
feet
dropping
my
pen
and
inking
the
page
on
which
i
was
at
work
that
dog
i
muttered
noting
what
i
had
done
then
even
as
i
said
the
words
there
sounded
again
that
queer
pad
pad
pad
it
was
horribly
close
almost
by
the
door
i
thought
i
knew
now
that
it
could
not
be
the
dog
his
chain
would
not
allow
him
to
come
so
near
the
dog
growl
came
again
and
i
noted
subconsciously
the
taint
of
fear
in
it
outside
on
the
windowsill
i
could
see
tip
my
sister
pet
cat
as
i
looked
it
sprang
to
its
feet
its
tail
swelling
visibly
for
an
instant
it
stood
thus
seeming
to
stare
fixedly
at
something
in
the
direction
of
the
door
then
quickly
it
began
to
back
along
the
sill
until
reaching
the
wall
at
the
end
it
could
go
no
further
there
it
stood
rigid
as
though
frozen
in
an
attitude
of
extraordinary
terror
frightened
and
puzzled
i
seized
a
stick
from
the
corner
and
went
toward
the
door
silently
taking
one
of
the
candles
with
me
i
had
come
to
within
a
few
paces
of
it
when
suddenly
a
peculiar
sense
of
fear
thrilled
through
me
a
fear
palpitant
and
real
whence
i
knew
not
nor
why
so
great
was
the
feeling
of
terror
that
i
wasted
no
time
but
retreated
walking
backward
and
keeping
my
gaze
fearfully
on
the
door
i
would
have
given
much
to
rush
at
it
fling
it
to
and
shoot
the
bolts
for
i
have
had
it
repaired
and
strengthened
so
that
now
it
is
far
stronger
than
ever
it
has
been
like
tip
i
continued
my
almost
unconscious
progress
backward
until
the
wall
brought
me
up
at
that
i
started
nervously
and
glanced
apprehensively
as
i
did
so
my
eyes
dwelt
momentarily
on
the
rack
of
firearms
and
i
took
a
step
toward
them
but
stopped
with
a
curious
feeling
that
they
would
be
needless
outside
in
the
gardens
the
dog
moaned
strangely
suddenly
from
the
cat
there
came
a
fierce
long
screech
i
glanced
jerkily
in
its
direction
something
luminous
and
ghostly
encircled
it
and
grew
upon
my
vision
it
resolved
into
a
glowing
hand
transparent
with
a
lambent
greenish
flame
flickering
over
it
the
cat
gave
a
last
awful
caterwaul
and
i
saw
it
smoke
and
blaze
my
breath
came
with
a
gasp
and
i
leant
against
the
wall
over
that
part
of
the
window
there
spread
a
smudge
green
and
fantastic
it
hid
the
thing
from
me
though
the
glare
of
fire
shone
through
dully
a
stench
of
burning
stole
into
the
room
pad
pad
pad
something
passed
down
the
garden
path
and
a
faint
mouldy
odor
seemed
to
come
in
through
the
open
door
and
mingle
with
the
burnt
smell
the
dog
had
been
silent
for
a
few
moments
now
i
heard
him
yowl
sharply
as
though
in
pain
then
he
was
quiet
save
for
an
occasional
subdued
whimper
of
fear
a
minute
went
by
then
the
gate
on
the
west
side
of
the
gardens
slammed
distantly
after
that
nothing
not
even
the
dog
whine
i
must
have
stood
there
some
minutes
then
a
fragment
of
courage
stole
into
my
heart
and
i
made
a
frightened
rush
at
the
door
dashed
it
to
and
bolted
it
after
that
for
a
full
i
sat
helpless
staring
before
me
rigidly
slowly
my
life
came
back
into
me
and
i
made
my
way
shakily
to
bed
that
is
all
the
thing
from
the
arena
this
morning
early
i
went
through
the
gardens
but
found
everything
as
usual
near
the
door
i
examined
the
path
for
footprints
yet
here
again
there
was
nothing
to
tell
me
whether
or
not
i
dreamed
last
night
it
was
only
when
i
came
to
speak
to
the
dog
that
i
discovered
tangible
proof
that
something
did
happen
when
i
went
to
his
kennel
he
kept
inside
crouching
up
in
one
corner
and
i
had
to
coax
him
to
get
him
out
when
finally
he
consented
to
come
it
was
in
a
strangely
cowed
and
subdued
manner
as
i
patted
him
my
attention
was
attracted
to
a
greenish
patch
on
his
left
flank
on
examining
it
i
found
that
the
fur
and
skin
had
been
apparently
burnt
off
for
the
flesh
showed
raw
and
scorched
the
shape
of
the
mark
was
curious
reminding
me
of
the
imprint
of
a
large
talon
or
hand
i
stood
up
thoughtful
my
gaze
wandered
toward
the
study
window
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
shimmered
on
the
smoky
patch
in
the
lower
corner
causing
it
to
fluctuate
from
green
to
red
oddly
ah
that
was
undoubtedly
another
proof
and
suddenly
the
horrible
thing
i
saw
last
night
rose
in
my
mind
i
looked
at
the
dog
again
i
knew
the
cause
now
of
that
hateful
looking
wound
on
his
side
i
knew
also
that
what
i
had
seen
last
night
had
been
a
real
happening
and
a
great
discomfort
filled
me
pepper
tip
and
now
this
poor
animal
i
glanced
at
the
dog
again
and
noticed
that
he
was
licking
at
his
wound
brute
i
muttered
and
bent
to
pat
his
head
at
that
he
got
upon
his
feet
nosing
and
licking
my
hand
wistfully
presently
i
left
him
having
other
matters
to
which
to
attend
after
dinner
i
went
to
see
him
again
he
seemed
quiet
and
disinclined
to
leave
his
kennel
from
my
sister
i
have
learnt
that
he
has
refused
all
food
today
she
appeared
a
little
puzzled
when
she
told
me
though
quite
unsuspicious
of
anything
of
which
to
be
afraid
the
day
has
passed
uneventfully
enough
after
tea
i
went
again
to
have
a
look
at
the
dog
he
seemed
moody
and
somewhat
restless
yet
persisted
in
remaining
in
his
kennel
before
locking
up
for
the
night
i
moved
his
kennel
out
away
from
the
wall
so
that
i
shall
be
able
to
watch
it
from
the
small
window
tonight
the
thought
came
to
me
to
bring
him
into
the
house
for
the
night
but
consideration
has
decided
me
to
let
him
remain
out
i
can
not
say
that
the
house
is
in
any
degree
less
to
be
feared
than
the
gardens
pepper
was
in
the
house
and
yet
it
is
now
two
since
eight
i
have
watched
the
kennel
from
the
small
side
window
in
my
study
yet
nothing
has
occurred
and
i
am
too
tired
to
watch
longer
i
will
go
to
bed
during
the
night
i
was
restless
this
is
unusual
for
me
but
toward
morning
i
obtained
a
few
hours
sleep
i
rose
early
and
after
breakfast
visited
the
dog
he
was
quiet
but
morose
and
refused
to
leave
his
kennel
i
wish
there
was
some
horse
doctor
near
here
i
would
have
the
poor
brute
looked
to
all
day
he
has
taken
no
food
but
has
shown
an
evident
desire
for
water
lapping
it
up
greedily
i
was
relieved
to
observe
this
the
evening
has
come
and
i
am
in
my
study
i
intend
to
follow
my
plan
of
last
night
and
watch
the
kennel
the
door
leading
into
the
garden
is
bolted
securely
i
am
consciously
glad
there
are
bars
to
the
windows
night
midnight
has
gone
the
dog
has
been
silent
up
to
the
present
through
the
side
window
on
my
left
i
can
make
out
dimly
the
outlines
of
the
kennel
for
the
first
time
the
dog
moves
and
i
hear
the
rattle
of
his
chain
i
look
out
quickly
as
i
stare
the
dog
moves
again
restlessly
and
i
see
a
small
patch
of
luminous
light
shine
from
the
interior
of
the
kennel
it
vanishes
then
the
dog
stirs
again
and
once
more
the
gleam
comes
i
am
puzzled
the
dog
is
quiet
and
i
can
see
the
luminous
thing
plainly
it
shows
distinctly
there
is
something
familiar
about
the
shape
of
it
for
a
moment
i
wonder
then
it
comes
to
me
that
it
is
not
unlike
the
four
fingers
and
thumb
of
a
hand
like
a
hand
and
i
remember
the
contour
of
that
fearsome
wound
on
the
side
it
must
be
the
wound
i
see
it
is
luminous
at
night
why
the
minutes
pass
my
mind
is
filled
with
this
fresh
thing
suddenly
i
hear
a
sound
out
in
the
gardens
how
it
thrills
through
me
it
is
approaching
pad
pad
pad
a
prickly
sensation
traverses
my
spine
and
seems
to
creep
across
my
scalp
the
dog
moves
in
his
kennel
and
whimpers
frightenedly
he
must
have
turned
for
now
i
can
no
longer
see
the
outline
of
his
shining
wound
outside
the
gardens
are
silent
once
more
and
i
listen
fearfully
a
minute
passes
and
another
then
i
hear
the
padding
sound
again
it
is
quite
close
and
appears
to
be
coming
down
the
graveled
path
the
noise
is
curiously
measured
and
deliberate
it
ceases
outside
the
door
and
i
rise
to
my
feet
and
stand
motionless
from
the
door
comes
a
slight
sound
the
latch
is
being
slowly
raised
a
singing
noise
is
in
my
ears
and
i
have
a
sense
of
pressure
about
the
head
the
latch
drops
with
a
sharp
click
into
the
catch
the
noise
startles
me
afresh
jarring
horribly
on
my
tense
nerves
after
that
i
stand
for
a
long
while
amid
an
quietness
all
at
once
my
knees
begin
to
tremble
and
i
have
to
sit
quickly
an
uncertain
period
of
time
passes
and
gradually
i
begin
to
shake
off
the
feeling
of
terror
that
has
possessed
me
yet
still
i
sit
i
seem
to
have
lost
the
power
of
movement
i
am
strangely
tired
and
inclined
to
doze
my
eyes
open
and
close
and
presently
i
find
myself
falling
asleep
and
waking
in
fits
and
starts
it
is
some
time
later
that
i
am
sleepily
aware
that
one
of
the
candles
is
guttering
when
i
wake
again
it
has
gone
out
and
the
room
is
very
dim
under
the
light
of
the
one
remaining
flame
the
troubles
me
little
i
have
lost
that
awful
sense
of
dread
and
my
only
desire
seems
to
be
to
sleep
sleep
suddenly
although
there
is
no
noise
i
am
awake
wide
awake
i
am
acutely
conscious
of
the
nearness
of
some
mystery
of
some
overwhelming
presence
the
very
air
seems
pregnant
with
terror
i
sit
huddled
and
just
listen
intently
still
there
is
no
sound
nature
herself
seems
dead
then
the
oppressive
stillness
is
broken
by
a
little
eldritch
scream
of
wind
that
sweeps
the
house
and
dies
away
remotely
i
let
my
gaze
wander
across
the
room
by
the
great
clock
in
the
far
corner
is
a
dark
tall
shadow
for
a
short
instant
i
stare
frightenedly
then
i
see
that
it
is
nothing
and
am
momentarily
relieved
in
the
time
that
follows
the
thought
flashes
through
my
brain
why
not
leave
this
house
this
house
of
mystery
and
terror
then
as
though
in
answer
there
sweeps
up
across
my
sight
a
vision
of
the
wondrous
sea
of
sleep
the
sea
of
sleep
where
she
and
i
have
been
allowed
to
meet
after
the
years
of
separation
and
sorrow
and
i
know
that
i
shall
stay
on
here
whatever
happens
through
the
side
window
i
note
the
somber
blackness
of
the
night
my
glance
wanders
away
and
the
room
resting
on
one
shadowy
object
and
another
suddenly
i
turn
and
look
at
the
window
on
my
right
as
i
do
so
i
breathe
quickly
and
bend
forward
with
a
frightened
gaze
at
something
outside
the
window
but
close
to
the
bars
i
am
looking
at
a
vast
misty
over
which
fluctuates
a
flamboyant
flame
of
a
greenish
hue
it
is
the
thing
from
the
arena
the
quivering
mouth
seems
to
drip
with
a
continual
phosphorescent
slaver
the
eyes
are
staring
straight
into
the
room
with
an
inscrutable
expression
thus
i
sit
rigidly
frozen
the
thing
has
begun
to
move
it
is
turning
slowly
in
my
direction
its
face
is
coming
toward
me
it
sees
me
two
huge
inhumanly
human
eyes
are
looking
through
the
dimness
at
me
i
am
cold
with
fear
yet
even
now
i
am
keenly
conscious
and
note
in
an
irrelevant
way
that
the
distant
stars
are
blotted
out
by
the
mass
of
the
giant
face
a
fresh
horror
has
come
to
me
i
am
rising
from
my
chair
without
the
least
intention
i
am
on
my
feet
and
something
is
impelling
me
toward
the
door
that
leads
out
into
the
gardens
i
wish
to
stop
but
can
not
some
immutable
power
is
opposed
to
my
will
and
i
go
slowly
forward
unwilling
and
resistant
my
glance
flies
the
room
helplessly
and
stops
at
the
window
the
great
has
disappeared
and
i
hear
again
that
stealthy
pad
pad
pad
it
stops
outside
the
door
the
door
toward
which
i
am
being
compelled
there
succeeds
a
short
intense
silence
then
there
comes
a
sound
it
is
the
rattle
of
the
latch
being
slowly
lifted
at
that
i
am
filled
with
desperation
i
will
not
go
forward
another
step
i
make
a
vast
effort
to
return
but
it
is
as
though
i
press
back
upon
an
invisible
wall
i
groan
out
loud
in
the
agony
of
my
fear
and
the
sound
of
my
voice
is
frightening
again
comes
that
rattle
and
i
shiver
clammily
i
try
aye
fight
and
struggle
to
hold
back
but
it
is
no
use
i
am
at
the
door
and
in
a
mechanical
way
i
watch
my
hand
go
forward
to
undo
the
topmost
bolt
it
does
so
entirely
without
my
volition
even
as
i
reach
up
toward
the
bolt
the
door
is
violently
shaken
and
i
get
a
sickly
whiff
of
mouldy
air
which
seems
to
drive
in
through
the
interstices
of
the
doorway
i
draw
the
bolt
back
slowly
fighting
dumbly
the
while
it
comes
out
of
its
socket
with
a
click
and
i
begin
to
shake
aguishly
there
are
two
more
one
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
the
other
a
massive
affair
is
placed
about
the
middle
for
perhaps
a
minute
i
stand
with
my
arms
hanging
slackly
by
my
sides
the
influence
to
meddle
with
the
fastenings
of
the
door
seems
to
have
gone
all
at
once
there
comes
the
sudden
rattle
of
iron
at
my
feet
i
glance
down
quickly
and
realize
with
an
unspeakable
terror
that
my
foot
is
pushing
back
the
lower
bolt
an
awful
sense
of
helplessness
assails
me
the
bolt
comes
out
of
its
hold
with
a
slight
ringing
sound
and
i
stagger
on
my
feet
grasping
at
the
great
central
bolt
for
support
a
minute
passes
an
eternity
then
another
my
god
help
me
i
am
being
forced
to
work
upon
the
last
fastening
will
not
better
to
die
than
open
to
the
terror
that
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
is
there
no
escape
god
help
me
i
have
jerked
the
bolt
half
out
of
its
socket
my
lips
emit
a
hoarse
scream
of
terror
the
bolt
is
three
parts
drawn
now
and
still
my
unconscious
hands
work
toward
my
doom
only
a
fraction
of
steel
between
my
soul
and
that
twice
i
scream
out
in
the
supreme
agony
of
my
fear
then
with
a
mad
effort
i
tear
my
hands
away
my
eyes
seem
blinded
a
great
blackness
is
falling
upon
me
nature
has
come
to
my
rescue
i
feel
my
knees
giving
there
is
a
loud
quick
thudding
upon
the
door
and
i
am
falling
falling
i
must
have
lain
there
at
least
a
couple
of
hours
as
i
recover
i
am
aware
that
the
other
candle
has
burnt
out
and
the
room
is
in
an
almost
total
darkness
i
can
not
rise
to
my
feet
for
i
am
cold
and
filled
with
a
terrible
cramp
yet
my
brain
is
clear
and
there
is
no
longer
the
strain
of
that
unholy
influence
cautiously
i
get
upon
my
knees
and
feel
for
the
central
bolt
i
find
it
and
push
it
securely
back
into
its
socket
then
the
one
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
by
this
time
i
am
able
to
rise
to
my
feet
and
so
manage
to
secure
the
fastening
at
the
top
after
that
i
go
down
upon
my
knees
again
and
creep
away
among
the
furniture
in
the
direction
of
the
stairs
by
doing
this
i
am
safe
from
observation
from
the
window
i
reach
the
opposite
door
and
as
i
leave
the
study
cast
one
nervous
glance
over
my
shoulder
toward
the
window
out
in
the
night
i
seem
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
something
impalpable
but
it
may
be
only
a
fancy
then
i
am
in
the
passage
and
on
the
stairs
reaching
my
bedroom
i
clamber
into
bed
all
clothed
as
i
am
and
pull
the
bedclothes
over
me
there
after
awhile
i
begin
to
regain
a
little
confidence
it
is
impossible
to
sleep
but
i
am
grateful
for
the
added
warmth
of
the
bedclothes
presently
i
try
to
think
over
the
happenings
of
the
past
night
but
though
i
can
not
sleep
i
find
that
it
is
useless
to
attempt
consecutive
thought
my
brain
seems
curiously
blank
toward
morning
i
begin
to
toss
uneasily
i
can
not
rest
and
after
awhile
i
get
out
of
bed
and
pace
the
floor
the
wintry
dawn
is
beginning
to
creep
through
the
windows
and
shows
the
bare
discomfort
of
the
old
room
strange
that
through
all
these
years
it
has
never
occurred
to
me
how
dismal
the
place
really
is
and
so
a
time
passes
from
somewhere
down
stairs
a
sound
comes
up
to
me
i
go
to
the
bedroom
door
and
listen
it
is
mary
bustling
about
the
great
old
kitchen
getting
the
breakfast
ready
i
feel
little
interest
i
am
not
hungry
my
thoughts
however
continue
to
dwell
upon
her
how
little
the
weird
happenings
in
this
house
seem
to
trouble
her
except
in
the
incident
of
the
pit
creatures
she
has
seemed
unconscious
of
anything
unusual
occurring
she
is
old
like
myself
yet
how
little
we
have
to
do
with
one
another
is
it
because
we
have
nothing
in
common
or
only
that
being
old
we
care
less
for
society
than
quietness
these
and
other
matters
pass
through
my
mind
as
i
meditate
and
help
to
distract
my
attention
for
a
while
from
the
oppressive
thoughts
of
the
night
after
a
time
i
go
to
the
window
and
opening
it
look
out
the
sun
is
now
above
the
horizon
and
the
air
though
cold
is
sweet
and
crisp
gradually
my
brain
clears
and
a
sense
of
security
for
the
time
being
comes
to
me
somewhat
happier
i
go
down
stairs
and
out
into
the
garden
to
have
a
look
at
the
dog
as
i
approach
the
kennel
i
am
greeted
by
the
same
mouldy
stench
that
assailed
me
at
the
door
last
night
shaking
off
a
momentary
sense
of
fear
i
call
to
the
dog
but
he
takes
no
heed
and
after
calling
once
more
i
throw
a
small
stone
into
the
kennel
at
this
he
moves
uneasily
and
i
shout
his
name
again
but
do
not
go
closer
presently
my
sister
comes
out
and
joins
me
in
trying
to
coax
him
from
the
kennel
in
a
little
the
poor
beast
rises
and
shambles
out
lurching
queerly
in
the
daylight
he
stands
swaying
from
side
to
side
and
blinking
stupidly
i
look
and
note
that
the
horrid
wound
is
larger
much
larger
and
seems
to
have
a
whitish
fungoid
appearance
my
sister
moves
to
fondle
him
but
i
detain
her
and
explain
that
i
think
it
will
be
better
not
to
go
too
near
him
for
a
few
days
as
it
is
impossible
to
tell
what
may
be
the
matter
with
him
and
it
is
well
to
be
cautious
a
minute
later
she
leaves
me
coming
back
with
a
basin
of
odd
scraps
of
food
this
she
places
on
the
ground
near
the
dog
and
i
push
it
into
his
reach
with
the
aid
of
a
branch
broken
from
one
of
the
shrubs
yet
though
the
meat
should
be
tempting
he
takes
no
notice
of
it
but
retires
to
his
kennel
there
is
still
water
in
his
drinking
vessel
so
after
a
few
moments
talk
we
go
back
to
the
house
i
can
see
that
my
sister
is
much
puzzled
as
to
what
is
the
matter
with
the
animal
yet
it
would
be
madness
even
to
hint
the
truth
to
her
the
day
slips
away
uneventfully
and
night
comes
on
i
have
determined
to
repeat
my
experiment
of
last
night
i
can
not
say
that
it
is
wisdom
yet
my
mind
is
made
up
still
however
i
have
taken
precautions
for
i
have
driven
stout
nails
in
at
the
back
of
each
of
the
three
bolts
that
secure
the
door
opening
from
the
study
into
the
gardens
this
will
at
least
prevent
a
recurrence
of
the
danger
i
ran
last
night
from
ten
to
about
i
watch
but
nothing
occurs
and
finally
i
stumble
off
to
bed
where
i
am
soon
asleep
the
luminous
speck
i
awake
suddenly
it
is
still
dark
i
turn
over
once
or
twice
in
my
endeavors
to
sleep
again
but
i
can
not
sleep
my
head
is
aching
slightly
and
by
turns
i
am
hot
and
cold
in
a
little
i
give
up
the
attempt
and
stretch
out
my
hand
for
the
matches
i
will
light
my
candle
and
read
awhile
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
sleep
after
a
time
for
a
few
moments
i
grope
then
my
hand
touches
the
box
but
as
i
open
it
i
am
startled
to
see
a
phosphorescent
speck
of
fire
shining
amid
the
darkness
i
put
out
my
other
hand
and
touch
it
it
is
on
my
wrist
with
a
feeling
of
vague
alarm
i
strike
a
light
hurriedly
and
look
but
can
see
nothing
save
a
tiny
scratch
i
mutter
with
a
half
sigh
of
relief
then
the
match
burns
my
finger
and
i
drop
it
quickly
as
i
fumble
for
another
the
thing
shines
out
again
i
know
now
that
it
is
no
fancy
this
time
i
light
the
candle
and
examine
the
place
more
closely
there
is
a
slight
greenish
discoloration
the
scratch
i
am
puzzled
and
worried
then
a
thought
comes
to
me
i
remember
the
morning
after
the
thing
appeared
i
remember
that
the
dog
licked
my
hand
it
was
this
one
with
the
scratch
on
it
though
i
have
not
been
even
conscious
of
the
abasement
until
now
a
horrible
fear
has
come
to
me
it
creeps
into
my
brain
the
dog
wound
shines
at
night
with
a
dazed
feeling
i
sit
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
try
to
think
but
can
not
my
brain
seems
numbed
with
the
sheer
horror
of
this
new
fear
time
moves
on
unheeded
once
i
rouse
up
and
try
to
persuade
myself
that
i
am
mistaken
but
it
is
no
use
in
my
heart
i
have
no
doubt
hour
after
hour
i
sit
in
the
darkness
and
silence
and
shiver
hopelessly
the
day
has
come
and
gone
and
it
is
night
again
this
morning
early
i
shot
the
dog
and
buried
it
away
among
the
bushes
my
sister
is
startled
and
frightened
but
i
am
desperate
besides
it
is
better
so
the
foul
growth
had
almost
hidden
its
left
side
and
i
the
place
on
my
wrist
has
enlarged
perceptibly
several
times
i
have
caught
myself
muttering
prayers
little
things
learnt
as
a
child
god
almighty
god
help
me
i
shall
go
mad
six
days
and
i
have
eaten
nothing
it
is
night
i
am
sitting
in
my
chair
ah
god
i
wonder
have
any
ever
felt
the
horror
of
life
that
i
have
come
to
know
i
am
swathed
in
terror
i
feel
ever
the
burning
of
this
dread
growth
it
has
covered
all
my
right
arm
and
side
and
is
beginning
to
creep
up
my
neck
tomorrow
it
will
eat
into
my
face
i
shall
become
a
terrible
mass
of
living
corruption
there
is
no
escape
yet
a
thought
has
come
to
me
born
of
a
sight
of
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
i
have
looked
again
with
the
strangest
of
feelings
the
thought
grows
upon
me
god
thou
knowest
thou
must
know
that
death
is
better
aye
better
a
thousand
times
than
this
this
jesus
forgive
me
but
i
can
not
live
can
not
can
not
i
dare
not
i
am
beyond
all
help
there
is
nothing
else
left
it
will
at
least
spare
me
that
final
horror
i
think
i
must
have
been
dozing
i
am
very
weak
and
oh
so
miserable
so
miserable
and
tired
tired
the
rustle
of
the
paper
tries
my
brain
my
hearing
seems
preternaturally
sharp
i
will
sit
awhile
and
think
hush
i
hear
something
down
down
in
the
cellars
it
is
a
creaking
sound
my
god
it
is
the
opening
of
the
great
oak
trap
what
can
be
doing
that
the
scratching
of
my
pen
deafens
me
i
must
listen
there
are
steps
on
the
stairs
strange
padding
steps
that
come
up
and
nearer
jesus
be
merciful
to
me
an
old
man
there
is
something
fumbling
at
the
o
god
help
me
now
jesus
the
door
is
opening
slowly
somethi
that
is
all
conclusion
i
put
down
the
manuscript
and
glanced
across
at
tonnison
he
was
sitting
staring
out
into
the
dark
i
waited
a
minute
then
i
spoke
well
i
said
he
turned
slowly
and
looked
at
me
his
thoughts
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
him
into
a
great
distance
was
he
mad
i
asked
and
indicated
the
with
a
half
nod
tonnison
stared
at
me
unseeingly
a
moment
then
his
wits
came
back
to
him
and
suddenly
he
comprehended
my
question
no
he
said
i
opened
my
lips
to
offer
a
contradictory
opinion
for
my
sense
of
the
saneness
of
things
would
not
allow
me
to
take
the
story
literally
then
i
shut
them
again
without
saying
anything
somehow
the
certainty
in
tonnison
voice
affected
my
doubts
i
felt
all
at
once
less
assured
though
i
was
by
no
means
convinced
as
yet
after
a
few
moments
silence
tonnison
rose
stiffly
and
began
to
undress
he
seemed
disinclined
to
talk
so
i
said
nothing
but
followed
his
example
i
was
weary
though
still
full
of
the
story
i
had
just
read
somehow
as
i
rolled
into
my
blankets
there
crept
into
my
mind
a
memory
of
the
old
gardens
as
we
had
seen
them
i
remembered
the
odd
fear
that
the
place
had
conjured
up
in
our
hearts
and
it
grew
upon
me
with
conviction
that
tonnison
was
right
it
was
very
late
when
we
rose
nearly
midday
for
the
greater
part
of
the
night
had
been
spent
in
reading
the
tonnison
was
grumpy
and
i
felt
out
of
sorts
it
was
a
somewhat
dismal
day
and
there
was
a
touch
of
chilliness
in
the
air
there
was
no
mention
of
going
out
fishing
on
either
of
our
parts
we
got
dinner
and
after
that
just
sat
and
smoked
in
silence
presently
tonnison
asked
for
the
manuscript
i
handed
it
to
him
and
he
spent
most
of
the
afternoon
in
reading
it
through
by
himself
it
was
while
he
was
thus
employed
that
a
thought
came
to
me
what
do
you
say
to
having
another
look
at
i
nodded
my
head
down
stream
tonnison
looked
up
nothing
he
said
abruptly
and
somehow
i
was
less
annoyed
than
relieved
at
his
answer
after
that
i
left
him
alone
a
little
before
teatime
he
looked
up
at
me
curiously
sorry
old
chap
if
i
was
a
bit
short
with
you
just
now
just
now
indeed
he
had
not
spoken
for
the
last
three
hours
but
i
would
not
go
there
again
and
he
indicated
with
his
head
for
anything
that
you
could
offer
me
ugh
and
he
put
down
that
history
of
a
man
terror
and
hope
and
despair
the
next
morning
we
rose
early
and
went
for
our
accustomed
swim
we
had
partly
shaken
off
the
depression
of
the
previous
day
and
so
took
our
rods
when
we
had
finished
breakfast
and
spent
the
day
at
our
favorite
sport
after
that
day
we
enjoyed
our
holiday
to
the
utmost
though
both
of
us
looked
forward
to
the
time
when
our
driver
should
come
for
we
were
tremendously
anxious
to
inquire
of
him
and
through
him
among
the
people
of
the
tiny
hamlet
whether
any
of
them
could
give
us
information
about
that
strange
garden
lying
away
by
itself
in
the
heart
of
an
almost
unknown
tract
of
country
at
last
the
day
came
on
which
we
expected
the
driver
to
come
across
for
us
he
arrived
early
while
we
were
still
abed
and
the
first
thing
we
knew
he
was
at
the
opening
of
the
tent
inquiring
whether
we
had
had
good
sport
we
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
then
both
together
almost
in
the
same
breath
we
asked
the
question
that
was
uppermost
in
our
minds
did
he
know
anything
about
an
old
garden
and
a
great
pit
and
a
lake
situated
some
miles
away
down
the
river
also
had
he
ever
heard
of
a
great
house
thereabouts
no
he
did
not
and
had
not
yet
stay
he
had
heard
a
rumor
once
upon
a
time
of
a
great
old
house
standing
alone
out
in
the
wilderness
but
if
he
remembered
rightly
it
was
a
place
given
over
to
the
fairies
or
if
that
had
not
been
so
he
was
certain
that
there
had
been
something
quare
about
it
and
anyway
he
had
heard
nothing
of
it
for
a
very
long
while
not
since
he
was
quite
a
gossoon
no
he
could
not
remember
anything
particular
about
it
indeed
he
did
not
know
he
remembered
anything
at
all
at
all
until
we
questioned
him
look
here
said
tonnison
finding
that
this
was
about
all
that
he
could
tell
us
just
take
a
walk
the
village
while
we
dress
and
find
out
something
if
you
can
with
a
nondescript
salute
the
man
departed
on
his
errand
while
we
made
haste
to
get
into
our
clothes
after
which
we
began
to
prepare
breakfast
we
were
just
sitting
down
to
it
when
he
returned
it
all
in
bed
the
lazy
divvils
is
sor
he
said
with
a
repetition
of
the
salute
and
an
appreciative
eye
to
the
good
things
spread
out
on
our
provision
chest
which
we
utilized
as
a
table
oh
well
sit
down
replied
my
friend
and
have
something
to
eat
with
us
which
the
man
did
without
delay
after
breakfast
tonnison
sent
him
off
again
on
the
same
errand
while
we
sat
and
smoked
he
was
away
some
of
an
hour
and
when
he
returned
it
was
evident
that
he
had
found
out
something
it
appeared
that
he
had
got
into
conversation
with
an
ancient
man
of
the
village
who
probably
knew
more
though
it
was
little
enough
of
the
strange
house
than
any
other
person
living
the
substance
of
this
knowledge
was
that
in
the
ancient
man
youth
and
goodness
knows
how
long
back
that
was
there
had
stood
a
great
house
in
the
center
of
the
gardens
where
now
was
left
only
that
fragment
of
ruin
this
house
had
been
empty
for
a
great
while
years
before
his
the
ancient
man
birth
it
was
a
place
shunned
by
the
people
of
the
village
as
it
had
been
shunned
by
their
fathers
before
them
there
were
many
things
said
about
it
and
all
were
of
evil
no
one
ever
went
near
it
either
by
day
or
night
in
the
village
it
was
a
synonym
of
all
that
is
unholy
and
dreadful
and
then
one
day
a
man
a
stranger
had
ridden
through
the
village
and
turned
off
down
the
river
in
the
direction
of
the
house
as
it
was
always
termed
by
the
villagers
some
hours
afterward
he
had
ridden
back
taking
the
track
by
which
he
had
come
toward
ardrahan
then
for
three
months
or
so
nothing
was
heard
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
reappeared
but
now
he
was
accompanied
by
an
elderly
woman
and
a
large
number
of
donkeys
laden
with
various
articles
they
had
passed
through
the
village
without
stopping
and
gone
straight
down
the
bank
of
the
river
in
the
direction
of
the
house
since
that
time
no
one
save
the
man
whom
they
had
chartered
to
bring
over
monthly
supplies
of
necessaries
from
ardrahan
had
ever
seen
either
of
them
and
him
none
had
ever
induced
to
talk
evidently
he
had
been
well
paid
for
his
trouble
the
years
had
moved
onward
uneventfully
enough
in
that
little
hamlet
the
man
making
his
monthly
journeys
regularly
one
day
he
had
appeared
as
usual
on
his
customary
errand
he
had
passed
through
the
village
without
exchanging
more
than
a
surly
nod
with
the
inhabitants
and
gone
on
toward
the
house
usually
it
was
evening
before
he
made
the
return
journey
on
this
occasion
however
he
had
reappeared
in
the
village
a
few
hours
later
in
an
extraordinary
state
of
excitement
and
with
the
astounding
information
that
the
house
had
disappeared
bodily
and
that
a
stupendous
pit
now
yawned
in
the
place
where
it
had
stood
this
news
it
appears
so
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
villagers
that
they
overcame
their
fears
and
marched
to
the
place
there
they
found
everything
just
as
described
by
the
carrier
this
was
all
that
we
could
learn
of
the
author
of
the
who
he
was
and
whence
he
came
we
shall
never
know
his
identity
is
as
he
seems
to
have
desired
buried
forever
that
same
day
we
left
the
lonely
village
of
kraighten
we
have
never
been
there
since
sometimes
in
my
dreams
i
see
that
enormous
pit
surrounded
as
it
is
on
all
sides
by
wild
trees
and
bushes
and
the
noise
of
the
water
rises
upward
and
blends
in
my
sleep
with
other
and
lower
noises
while
over
all
hangs
the
eternal
shroud
of
spray
grief
fierce
hunger
reigns
within
my
breast
i
had
not
dreamt
that
this
whole
world
crushed
in
the
hand
of
god
could
yield
such
bitter
essence
of
unrest
such
pain
as
sorrow
now
hath
hurled
out
of
its
dreadful
heart
unsealed
each
sobbing
breath
is
but
a
cry
my
knells
of
agony
and
my
whole
brain
has
but
one
thought
that
nevermore
through
life
shall
i
save
in
the
ache
of
memory
touch
hands
with
thee
who
now
art
naught
through
the
whole
void
of
night
i
search
so
dumbly
crying
out
to
thee
but
thou
are
and
night
vast
throne
becomes
an
all
stupendous
church
with
knelling
unto
me
who
in
all
space
am
most
alone
an
hungered
to
the
shore
i
creep
perchance
some
comfort
waits
on
me
from
the
old
sea
eternal
heart
but
lo
from
all
the
solemn
deep
far
voices
out
of
mystery
seem
questioning
why
we
are
apart
i
go
i
am
alone
who
once
through
thee
had
all
the
world
my
breast
is
one
whole
raging
pain
for
that
which
and
now
is
flown
into
the
blank
where
life
is
hurled
where
all
is
not
nor
is
again

that

that

journey
had
ceased
to
bear
its

proportion
to
the
period
of
the
sun

a
careful
reading
of
the

that
either
the
sun
is
traveling
on
an
orbit
of
great
eccentricity
or
else
that
it
was
approaching
the
green
star
on
a
lessening
orbit

at
this
moment
i
conceive
it
to
be
finally
torn
directly
from
its

course

the
gravitational
pull
of

will
be
noticed
here
that
the
earth
was
traversing
the
tremendous
face
of
the
dead
sun
no
explanation
is
given
of
this
and
we
must
conclude
either
that
the
speed
of
time
had
slowed
or
else
that
the
earth
was
actually
progressing
on
its
orbit
at
a
rate
slow
when
measured
by
existing
standards

careful
study
of
the

leads
me
to
conclude
that
the
speed
of

had
been
steadily
decreasing

a
very
considerable
