master
spy
of
the
red
planet
jery
delvin
had
a
most
unusual
talent
he
could
detect
the
flaws
in
any
scheme
almost
on
sight
even
where
they
had
eluded
the
best
brains
in
the
ad
agency
where
he
worked
so
when
the
chief
of
world
security
told
him
that
he
had
been
selected
as
the
answer
to
the
solar
greatest
mystery
jery
assumed
that
it
was
because
of
his
mental
agility
but
when
he
got
to
mars
to
find
out
why
fifteen
boys
had
vanished
from
a
spaceship
in
he
found
out
that
even
his
quick
mind
needed
time
to
pierce
the
maze
of
for
jery
had
become
a
walking
bomb
and
when
he
set
himself
off
it
would
be
the
end
of
the
whole
puzzle
of
the
secret
martians
with
jery
as
the
first
to
go
jack
sharkey
decided
to
be
a
writer
nineteen
years
ago
in
the
fourth
grade
when
he
realized
all
at
once
that
someone
wrote
all
those
stories
in
the
textbooks
while
everyone
else
looked
forward
variously
to
becoming
firemen
cowboys
and
trapeze
artists
jack
was
devouring
every
book
he
could
get
his
hands
on
figuring
that
if
i
put
enough
literature
into
my
head
some
of
it
might
overflow
and
come
out
after
sixteen
years
of
education
jack
found
himself
teaching
high
school
english
in
chicago
a
worthwhile
career
but
not
what
one
would
call
zesty
after
a
army
hitch
and
a
year
in
advertising
sublimating
my
urge
to
write
things
for
cash
jack
moved
to
new
york
determined
to
make
a
career
of
oddly
enough
it
worked
out
and
he
now
does
nothing
else
he
says
i
like
to
say
i
do
this
for
fulfillment
or
for
cash
or
because
it
my
destiny
however
the
real
reason
same
as
that
expressed
by
jean
kerr
is
that
this
kind
of
lets
me
sleep
late
in
the
morning
i
was
sitting
at
my
desk
trying
to
decide
how
to
tell
the
women
of
america
that
they
were
certain
to
be
lovely
in
a
brassiere
without
absolutely
guaranteeing
them
anything
when
the
two
security
men
came
to
get
me
i
did
quite
believe
it
at
first
when
i
looked
up
and
saw
them
of
steel
nerves
and
gimlet
eyes
staring
down
at
me
amidst
my
litter
of
sketches
crumpled
copy
sheets
and
deadline
memos
it
was
only
a
fraction
of
an
instant
between
the
time
i
saw
them
and
the
time
they
spoke
to
me
but
in
that
miniscule
interval
i
managed
to
retrace
quite
a
bit
of
my
lifetime
up
till
that
moment
seeking
vainly
for
some
reason
why
they
be
standing
there
so
terribly
and
inflexibly
efficient
looking
mostly
i
ran
back
over
all
the
ads
created
okayed
for
solar
sales
during
my
five
years
with
the
firm
trying
to
see
just
where
i
gone
and
shaken
the
security
of
the
government
i
could
find
anything
really
incriminating
unless
maybe
it
was
that
hair
dye
that
unexpectedly
turned
bright
green
after
six
weeks
in
the
hair
but
that
was
the
lab
fault
not
mine
so
i
managed
a
weak
smile
toward
the
duo
and
tried
not
to
sweat
too
profusely
jery
delvin
said
the
one
on
my
left
a
note
of
in
his
brusque
baritone
yes
i
said
some
terrified
portion
of
my
mind
waiting
masochistically
for
them
to
draw
their
collapsers
and
reduce
me
to
a
heap
of
hot
protons
come
with
us
said
his
companion
i
stared
at
him
then
glanced
hopelessly
at
the
jumble
of
things
on
my
desk
never
mind
that
stuff
he
added
i
rose
from
my
place
slipped
my
jacket
from
its
hook
and
started
across
the
office
toward
the
door
each
of
them
falling
into
rigid
step
beside
me
marge
my
secretary
stood
as
we
passed
through
her
office
heading
for
the
hall
exit
delvin
she
said
her
voice
a
wispy
croak
when
will
you
be
back
the
man
is
waiting
for
your
i
opened
my
mouth
but
one
of
the
security
men
cut
in
you
will
be
informed
he
said
to
marge
she
was
staring
after
me
as
the
door
slid
neatly
shut
behind
us
i
be
back
i
asked
desperately
as
we
waited
for
the
elevator
at
all
am
i
under
arrest
what
up
anyhow
you
will
be
informed
said
the
man
again
i
had
to
let
it
go
at
that
security
men
were
not
hired
for
their
loquaciousness
they
had
a
car
waiting
at
the
curb
downstairs
in
the
no
parking
zone
the
cop
on
the
beat
very
politely
opened
the
door
for
them
when
we
got
there
those
uniforms
carry
an
awful
lot
of
weight
not
to
mention
the
golden
bulk
of
their
holstered
collapsers
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
sweat
it
out
and
to
try
and
enjoy
the
ride
wherever
we
were
going
are
jery
delvin
the
man
who
spoke
seemed
more
than
surprised
he
seemed
stunned
his
voice
held
an
incredulous
squeak
a
squeak
which
would
have
amazed
his
subordinates
it
certainly
amazed
me
because
the
speaker
was
philip
baxter
chief
of
interplanetary
security
second
only
to
the
world
president
in
power
and
not
even
that
in
matters
of
security
i
managed
to
nod
he
shook
his
head
slowly
i
do
believe
it
but
i
am
sir
i
insisted
doggedly
baxter
pressed
the
heels
of
his
hands
against
his
eyes
for
a
moment
then
sighed
grinned
wryly
and
waggled
an
index
finger
at
an
empty
plastic
contour
chair
i
guess
maybe
you
are
at
that
son
sit
down
sit
down
i
folded
gingerly
at
knees
and
hips
and
slid
back
into
the
chair
pressing
my
perspiring
palms
against
the
sides
of
my
pants
to
get
rid
of
their
uncomfortably
slippery
feel
thank
you
sir
there
was
a
silence
during
which
i
breathed
uneasily
and
a
bit
too
loudly
baxter
seemed
to
be
trying
to
say
something
i
suppose
you
wondering
why
i
called
he
started
then
stopped
short
and
flushed
with
embarrassment
i
felt
a
sympathetic
hot
wave
flooding
my
own
features
a
copy
chief
in
an
advertising
company
almost
always
reacts
to
an
obvious
cliche
then
with
something
like
a
look
of
relief
on
his
blunt
face
he
snatched
up
a
brochure
from
his
desktop
and
his
eyes
raced
over
the
lettering
on
its
face
jery
delvin
he
read
musingly
and
dispassionately
five
foot
eleven
inches
tall
brown
hair
eyes
citizen
honest
sober
slightly
antisocial
he
looked
at
me
questioningly
i
rather
not
discuss
that
sir
if
you
do
mind
do
you
mind
if
i
do
mind
oh
oh
well
if
you
put
it
like
that
it
girls
sir
they
block
my
mind
ruin
my
work
i
do
get
you
well
in
my
job
see
i
got
this
gift
i
a
spotter
a
what
a
spotter
i
ca
be
fooled
by
advertising
or
mostly
anything
else
except
girls
i
still
not
sure
that
i
it
like
this
i
designate
ratios
by
the
minute
they
hand
me
a
new
ad
and
i
read
it
by
a
stopwatch
then
as
soon
as
i
spot
the
clinker
they
stop
the
watch
if
i
get
it
in
five
seconds
it
passes
but
if
i
spot
it
in
less
they
throw
it
out
and
start
over
again
or
is
that
clear
no
i
guess
you
still
confused
sir
just
a
bit
baxter
said
i
took
a
deep
breath
and
tried
again
maybe
an
example
would
be
better
uh
you
know
the
one
about
out
of
five
new
york
lawyers
use
hamilton
bond
paper
for
i
heard
that
yes
well
the
clinker
that
the
sneaky
part
of
the
ad
sir
or
what
we
call
the
clinker
in
that
one
is
that
while
it
seems
to
imply
sixty
percent
of
new
york
lawyers
it
actually
means
precisely
what
it
says
three
out
of
five
for
that
particular
product
we
had
to
question
lawyers
before
we
could
come
up
with
three
who
liked
hamilton
bond
see
then
we
took
the
names
of
the
three
and
the
names
of
two
of
the
men
remaining
and
kept
them
on
file
on
file
baxter
frowned
what
for
in
case
the
federal
trade
council
got
on
our
necks
we
could
prove
that
three
out
of
five
lawyers
used
the
product
three
out
of
those
five
see
ah
said
baxter
grinning
i
begin
to
and
your
job
is
to
test
these
ads
before
they
reach
the
public
what
fools
you
for
five
seconds
will
fool
the
average
consumer
indefinitely
i
sat
back
feeling
much
better
that
right
sir
then
baxter
frowned
again
but
what
this
about
girls
they
they
block
my
thinking
sir
that
all
why
take
that
example
i
just
mentioned
in
plain
writing
i
caught
the
clinker
in
of
a
second
then
they
handed
me
a
layout
with
a
picture
of
a
lawyer
dictating
notes
to
his
secretary
on
it
her
legs
were
crossed
nice
legs
gorgeous
legs
how
long
that
time
delvin
indefinite
till
they
took
the
girl
away
sir
baxter
cleared
his
throat
loudly
i
understand
at
last
hence
your
slight
antisocial
rating
you
avoid
women
in
order
to
keep
your
job
yes
sir
even
my
secretary
marge
whom
i
never
in
a
million
years
think
of
looking
at
twice
except
for
business
reasons
of
course
has
to
stay
out
of
my
office
when
i
working
or
i
ca
function
you
have
my
sympathy
son
baxter
said
not
unkindly
thank
you
sir
it
has
been
easy
no
i
do
imagine
it
has
baxter
was
staring
into
some
distance
then
he
remembered
himself
and
blinked
back
to
the
present
delvin
he
said
sharply
i
come
right
to
the
point
this
thing
is
you
have
been
chosen
for
an
extremely
important
mission
i
could
have
been
more
surprised
had
he
announced
my
incipient
maternity
but
i
was
able
to
ask
me
for
pete
sake
why
sir
baxter
looked
me
square
in
the
eye
damned
if
i
know
i
stared
at
him
nonplussed
he
spoken
with
evidence
of
utmost
candor
and
the
chief
of
interplanetary
security
was
not
one
to
be
accused
of
a
friendly
josh
but
you
kidding
i
said
you
must
be
otherwise
why
was
i
sent
for
believe
me
i
wish
i
knew
he
sighed
you
were
chosen
from
all
the
inhabitants
of
this
planet
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
colonies
by
the
brain
you
mean
that
international
cybernetics
picked
me
for
a
mission
that
crazy
if
you
pardon
me
sir
baxter
shrugged
and
his
genial
smile
was
a
bit
tightly
stretched
when
the
current
emergency
arose
and
all
our
usual
methods
failed
we
had
to
submit
the
problem
to
the
brain
and
i
said
beginning
to
be
fascinated
by
his
bewildered
manner
what
came
out
he
looked
at
me
for
a
long
moment
then
picked
up
that
brochure
again
and
said
without
referring
to
it
jery
delvin
five
foot
eleven
inches
tall
yes
but
read
me
the
part
where
it
says
why
i
was
picked
i
said
a
little
exasperated
baxter
eyed
me
balefully
then
skimmed
the
brochure
through
the
air
in
my
direction
i
caught
it
just
short
of
the
carpet
if
you
can
find
it
i
read
it
he
said
almost
snarling
i
looked
over
the
sheet
then
turned
it
over
and
scanned
the
black
opposite
side
all
it
gives
is
my
description
governmental
status
and
address
baxter
grunted
laconically
it
amuses
you
does
it
the
smile
was
still
on
his
lips
but
there
was
a
grimness
in
the
glitter
of
his
narrowing
eyes
not
really
i
said
hastily
it
baffles
me
to
be
frank
if
you
sitting
there
in
that
hopeful
stance
awaiting
some
sort
of
explanation
you
may
as
well
relax
baxter
said
shortly
i
have
none
to
make
ic
had
none
to
make
damn
it
all
to
hell
he
brought
a
meaty
fist
down
on
the
desktop
no
one
has
an
explanation
all
we
know
is
that
the
brain
always
picks
the
right
man
i
let
this
sink
in
then
asked
what
made
you
ask
for
a
man
in
the
first
place
sir
i
always
understood
that
your
own
staff
represented
some
of
the
finest
minds
hold
it
son
perhaps
i
did
make
myself
clear
we
asked
for
no
man
we
asked
for
a
solution
to
an
important
problem
and
your
name
was
what
we
got
you
son
are
the
solution
chief
of
security
or
not
i
was
getting
a
little
burned
up
at
his
highhanded
treatment
of
my
emotions
how
nice
i
said
icily
now
if
i
only
knew
the
problem
baxter
blinked
then
lost
some
of
his
scowl
yes
of
course
baxter
murmured
lighting
up
a
cigar
he
blew
a
plume
of
blue
smoke
toward
the
ceiling
then
continued
you
heard
of
course
of
the
space
scouts
i
nodded
like
the
boy
scouts
only
with
for
their
various
troops
in
place
of
the
old
animal
names
and
you
recall
the
recent
trip
they
had
to
mars
and
back
with
the
government
picking
up
the
enormous
tab
i
detected
a
tinge
of
cynicism
in
his
tone
but
said
nothing
what
a
gesture
baxter
went
on
hardly
speaking
directly
to
me
at
all
harmony
good
will
if
these
mere
boys
can
get
together
and
travel
the
voids
of
space
then
so
can
everyone
else
why
should
there
be
tensions
between
the
various
nations
comprising
the
world
government
when
there
none
between
these
fine
lads
one
from
every
civilized
nation
on
earth
you
sound
disillusioned
sir
i
interjected
he
stared
at
me
as
though
i
just
fallen
in
from
the
ceiling
or
somewhere
huh
oh
yes
delvin
is
it
sorry
i
got
carried
away
where
was
i
you
were
telling
about
how
this
gesture
the
wg
sending
these
kids
off
for
an
extraterrestrial
romp
will
cement
relations
between
those
nations
who
have
remained
hostile
despite
the
unification
of
all
governments
on
earth
personally
i
think
it
was
a
pretty
good
idea
myself
everybody
likes
kids
take
this
jam
we
were
trying
to
push
pomegranate
nectar
it
was
called
well
sir
it
just
would
sell
and
then
we
got
this
kid
with
freckles
like
confetti
all
over
his
slightly
bucktoothed
face
and
we
sir
i
paused
because
he
was
staring
at
me
like
a
man
on
the
brink
of
apoplexy
i
swallowed
and
tried
to
look
relaxed
after
a
moment
he
found
his
voice
to
go
on
delvin
do
you
recall
what
happened
to
the
space
scouts
last
week
i
thought
a
second
then
nodded
they
been
having
such
a
good
time
that
the
government
extended
their
trip
by
why
are
you
shaking
your
head
that
way
sir
because
it
not
true
delvin
he
said
his
voice
was
suddenly
old
and
tired
and
very
much
in
keeping
with
his
snowy
hair
you
see
the
space
scouts
have
vanished
i
came
up
in
the
chair
their
mothers
they
been
getting
letters
and
forgeries
fakes
counterfeits
you
mean
whoever
took
the
scouts
is
falsifying
no
men
are
doing
the
work
handpicked
crews
day
and
night
have
been
sending
those
letters
to
the
trusting
mothers
it
been
ghastly
delvin
hard
on
the
men
terribly
hard
undotted
misuse
of
tenses
deliberate
misspellings
they
take
it
out
of
an
adult
especially
an
adult
with
a
mind
keen
enough
to
get
him
into
interplanetary
security
we
limited
the
shifts
to
four
hours
per
man
per
day
otherwise
they
all
be
gibbering
by
now
and
your
men
have
found
out
anything
i
marvelled
baxter
shook
his
head
and
you
finally
had
to
resort
to
the
brain
and
it
gave
you
my
name
but
no
reason
for
it
baxter
cupped
his
slightly
jowled
cheeks
in
his
hands
and
propped
his
elbows
on
the
desktop
suddenly
slipping
out
of
his
high
position
to
talk
to
me
look
son
an
adding
machine
which
is
a
minor
form
of
an
electronic
brain
and
even
works
on
the
same
principle
can
tell
you
that
two
and
two
make
four
but
can
it
tell
you
why
well
no
but
that
in
a
nutshell
is
our
problem
we
coded
and
fed
to
the
brain
every
shred
of
information
at
our
disposal
the
ages
of
the
children
for
instance
and
all
their
physical
attributes
and
where
they
were
last
seen
and
what
they
were
wearing
hell
everything
the
machine
took
the
factors
weighed
them
popped
them
through
its
billions
of
relays
and
tubes
and
out
of
the
end
of
the
answer
slot
popped
a
single
sheet
the
one
you
just
saw
your
dossier
then
i
to
be
sent
to
mars
i
said
nervously
that
just
it
baxter
sighed
we
do
even
know
that
we
like
a
savage
who
finds
a
pistol
used
correctly
it
a
mean
little
weapon
pointed
the
wrong
way
it
a
quick
suicide
so
you
are
our
weapon
now
the
question
is
which
way
do
we
point
you
you
got
me
i
shrugged
hopelessly
however
since
we
have
nothing
else
to
go
on
but
the
locale
from
which
the
children
vanished
my
suggestion
would
be
to
send
you
there
mars
you
mean
i
said
no
to
the
spaceship
the
one
they
were
returning
to
earth
in
when
they
disappeared
they
disappeared
from
a
spaceship
while
in
space
baxter
nodded
but
that
impossible
i
said
shaking
my
head
against
this
disconcerting
thought
yes
said
baxter
that
what
bothers
me
for
obvious
reasons
was
berthed
in
a
top
security
spaceport
even
so
they
shuttled
it
into
a
hangar
safe
from
the
eyes
of
even
their
own
men
and
as
a
final
touch
had
hidden
the
nameplate
beneath
magnetic
i
had
a
metal
disk
bronze
and
red
the
security
colors
insigniaed
by
baxter
and
counterembossed
with
the
president
special
device
a
small
globe
surmounted
by
clasping
hands
it
gave
me
authority
to
do
anything
with
such
an
identification
disc
i
could
go
to
times
square
and
start
machine
gunning
the
and
not
one
of
new
finest
would
raise
a
hand
to
stop
me
and
snugly
enholstered
i
carried
a
collapser
the
restricted
weapon
given
only
to
security
agents
so
deadly
was
its
beam
baxter
had
spent
a
tremulous
hour
showing
me
how
to
use
the
weapon
and
especially
how
to
turn
the
beam
off
i
finally
gotten
the
hang
of
it
though
not
before
half
his
desk
had
flashed
into
nothingness
along
with
a
swath
of
carpeting
and
six
inches
of
concrete
floor
his
parting
injunction
had
been
be
careful
delvin
huh
yes
parting
i
was
on
my
own
after
all
with
a
security
disc
the
amnesty
they
called
it
such
as
i
possessed
and
a
collapser
i
could
go
anywhere
do
anything
commandeer
anything
i
might
need
all
with
no
questions
asked
needless
to
say
i
was
feeling
pretty
chipper
as
i
entered
the
hangar
housing
at
the
moment
i
was
the
most
influential
human
being
in
the
known
universe
the
pilot
as
per
my
videophoned
request
was
waiting
there
for
me
i
saw
him
as
i
stepped
into
the
cool
shadows
of
the
building
from
the
hot
yellow
sunlight
outside
he
was
tall
much
taller
than
i
but
he
seemed
nervous
as
hell
at
least
he
was
pacing
back
and
forth
amid
a
litter
of
cigarette
butts
beside
the
gleaming
tailfins
of
the
spaceship
and
a
fuming
butt
was
puckered
into
place
in
his
mouth
anders
i
said
approaching
to
within
five
feet
of
him
before
halting
to
get
the
best
psychological
effect
from
my
appearance
he
turned
saw
me
and
hurriedly
spat
the
butt
out
onto
the
cement
floor
yes
sir
he
said
loudly
throwing
me
a
quivering
salute
his
eyes
were
a
bit
wild
as
they
took
me
in
and
well
they
might
be
an
can
suddenly
decide
a
subject
is
not
answering
questions
to
his
satisfaction
and
simply
blast
the
annoying
party
to
atoms
it
makes
for
straight
responses
of
course
i
was
dressing
the
part
in
a
way
i
wore
the
amnesty
suspended
by
a
thin
golden
chain
from
my
neck
and
for
costume
i
wore
a
blouse
and
matching
uniform
trousers
and
boots
i
must
have
looked
quite
sinister
i
under
six
feet
but
i
angular
and
wiry
thus
in
ominous
black
with
an
amnesty
on
my
breast
and
a
collapser
in
my
holster
i
was
a
sight
to
strike
even
honest
citizens
into
quick
examinations
of
conscience
i
felt
a
little
silly
but
the
outfit
was
baxter
idea
i
understand
you
were
aboard
the
when
the
incident
occurred
i
said
sternly
which
was
unusual
for
my
wonted
demeanor
yes
sir
he
replied
swiftly
at
stiff
attention
i
do
really
have
any
details
i
said
and
waited
for
him
to
take
his
cue
as
an
afterthought
to
help
him
talk
i
added
at
ease
by
the
way
anders
thank
you
sir
he
said
not
actually
loosening
much
in
his
rigid
position
but
his
face
looking
happier
see
i
was
supposed
to
pilot
the
kids
back
here
from
mars
when
their
trip
was
done
and
he
gave
a
helpless
shrug
i
dunno
sir
i
got
all
aboard
made
sure
they
were
secure
in
the
takeoff
racks
and
then
i
set
my
coordinates
for
earth
and
took
off
just
a
takeoff
sir
and
when
did
you
notice
they
were
missing
i
asked
looking
at
the
metallic
bulk
of
the
ship
and
wondering
what
alien
force
could
snatch
fifteen
young
boys
through
its
impervious
hull
without
leaving
a
trace
chow
time
sir
that
when
you
expect
to
have
the
little
to
have
the
kids
in
your
hair
sir
everyone
wants
his
rations
first
you
know
how
kids
are
sir
so
i
went
to
the
galley
and
was
about
to
open
up
the
ration
packs
when
i
noticed
how
damned
quiet
it
was
aboard
and
especially
funny
that
no
one
was
in
the
galley
waiting
for
me
to
start
passing
the
stuff
out
so
you
searched
i
said
anders
nodded
sorrowfully
not
a
trace
of
sir
just
some
of
their
junk
left
in
their
storage
lockers
i
raised
my
eyebrows
really
i
be
interested
in
seeing
this
junk
anders
oh
yes
sir
right
this
way
sir
watch
out
for
these
rungs
slippery
i
ascended
the
retractable
metal
rungs
that
jutted
from
a
point
between
the
tailfins
to
the
open
airlock
twenty
feet
over
ground
level
and
followed
anders
inside
the
ship
i
trailed
anders
through
the
ship
from
the
pilot
compartment
a
bewildering
mass
of
dials
switches
signal
lights
and
wire
through
the
galley
into
the
troop
section
it
was
a
cramped
cubicle
housing
a
number
of
foam
rubber
bunks
the
bunks
were
empty
but
i
looked
them
over
anyhow
i
carefully
tugged
back
the
canvas
covering
that
fitted
over
a
foam
rubber
pad
and
ran
my
finger
over
the
surface
of
the
pad
it
came
away
just
slightly
gritty
i
said
smiling
anders
just
stared
at
me
i
turned
to
the
storage
lockers
let
see
this
junk
they
were
suddenly
deprived
of
anders
after
a
puzzled
frown
obediently
threw
open
the
doors
of
the
riveted
tiers
of
metal
boxes
along
the
rear
wall
the
wall
next
to
the
firing
chambers
which
i
had
no
particular
desire
to
visit
i
glanced
inside
at
the
articles
therein
and
noted
with
interest
their
similarity
now
then
i
resumed
the
thrust
of
this
rocket
to
get
from
mars
to
earth
is
calculated
with
regard
to
the
mass
on
board
is
that
correct
he
nodded
good
that
clears
up
an
important
point
i
also
like
to
know
if
this
rocket
has
a
dehumidifying
system
to
keep
the
moisture
from
the
passengers
out
of
the
air
well
sure
sir
said
anders
otherwise
we
all
be
swimming
in
our
own
sweat
after
a
trip
across
space
have
you
checked
the
storage
tanks
i
asked
or
is
the
perspiration
simply
jetted
into
space
no
it
saved
sir
it
gets
distilled
and
stored
for
washing
and
drinking
otherwise
we
all
dehydrate
with
no
water
to
replace
the
water
we
lost
check
the
tanks
i
said
anders
shaking
his
head
moved
into
the
pilot
section
and
looked
at
a
dial
there
full
sir
but
that
because
i
did
drink
very
much
and
any
sweating
i
did
which
was
a
hell
of
a
lot
in
this
case
was
a
source
of
new
water
for
the
tanks
i
paused
and
considered
i
suppose
the
tubing
for
these
tanks
is
all
over
the
ship
in
all
the
hollow
bulkhead
space
to
take
up
the
moisture
fast
anders
hopelessly
lost
could
only
nod
wearily
would
it
hold
i
did
some
quick
mental
arithmetic
let
say
about
extra
cubic
feet
he
stared
then
frowned
and
thought
hard
yes
sir
he
said
after
a
minute
even
twice
that
with
no
trouble
but
he
caught
himself
short
it
did
pay
to
be
too
curious
about
the
aims
of
an
it
all
right
anders
you
been
a
tremendous
help
just
one
thing
when
you
left
mars
you
took
off
from
the
night
side
did
you
why
yes
i
did
sir
but
how
did
you
no
matter
anders
that
be
all
yes
sir
he
saluted
sharply
and
started
off
i
started
back
for
interplanetary
security
and
my
second
and
i
hoped
last
interview
with
chief
baxter
i
had
a
slight
inkling
why
the
brain
had
chosen
me
because
in
the
affair
of
the
missing
space
scouts
my
infallible
talent
for
spotting
the
true
within
the
apparent
had
come
through
nicely
i
had
found
a
very
interesting
clinker
strange
i
remarked
to
chief
baxter
when
i
was
seated
once
again
in
his
office
opposite
his
newly
replaced
desk
i
hardly
acted
like
myself
out
at
that
airfield
i
was
brusque
highhanded
austere
almost
malevolent
with
the
pilot
and
i
ordinarily
on
the
shy
side
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
the
amnesty
that
does
it
he
said
gesturing
toward
the
disc
it
lay
on
his
desk
now
along
with
the
collapser
i
felt
with
the
new
information
i
garnered
that
my
work
was
done
and
that
the
new
data
fed
into
the
brain
would
produce
some
other
results
not
involving
me
i
looked
at
the
amnesty
then
nodded
kind
of
gets
you
after
awhile
to
know
that
you
are
the
most
influential
person
in
creation
is
to
automatically
act
the
part
a
shame
in
a
way
the
hell
it
is
baxter
snapped
good
grief
man
why
you
think
the
amnesty
was
created
in
the
first
place
i
sat
up
straight
and
scratched
the
back
of
my
head
now
you
mention
it
i
really
do
know
it
seems
a
pretty
dangerous
thing
to
have
about
the
way
people
jump
when
they
see
it
it
is
dangerous
of
course
but
it
vitally
necessary
you
young
jery
delvin
and
even
the
finest
history
course
available
these
days
is
slanted
in
favor
of
world
government
so
you
have
no
idea
how
tough
things
were
before
the
amnesty
came
along
ever
hear
of
red
tape
i
shook
my
head
no
i
do
believe
so
unless
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
former
communist
menace
they
called
themselves
the
reds
i
believe
he
waved
me
silent
no
connection
at
all
son
no
red
tape
was
well
involvement
forms
to
be
signed
certain
factors
to
be
considered
protocol
to
be
dealt
with
government
agencies
to
be
checked
with
classifications
bureaus
congressional
committees
it
was
impossible
jery
my
boy
to
get
anything
done
whatsoever
without
consulting
someone
else
and
the
time
lag
and
paperwork
involved
made
accurate
and
swift
action
impossible
sometimes
what
we
needed
of
course
was
a
person
who
could
simply
have
all
authority
in
order
to
save
the
sometimes
disastrous
delays
so
we
came
up
with
the
amnesty
but
the
danger
if
you
should
pick
the
wrong
man
baxter
smiled
no
chance
of
that
jery
we
did
leave
it
up
to
any
committee
or
bureau
or
any
other
faction
to
do
the
picking
hell
that
would
have
put
us
right
back
where
we
been
before
no
we
left
it
up
to
the
brain
we
find
ourselves
in
a
tight
situation
and
the
brain
after
being
fed
the
data
would
come
up
with
either
a
solution
or
a
name
i
stared
at
him
then
when
i
was
here
before
i
was
here
solely
to
receive
the
amnesty
is
that
it
baxter
nodded
the
brain
just
picks
the
men
then
we
tell
the
men
the
situation
hand
over
the
amnesty
and
pray
i
had
a
sudden
thought
say
what
happens
if
two
men
are
selected
by
the
brain
who
has
authority
over
whom
baxter
grimaced
and
shivered
do
even
think
such
a
thing
even
your
mentioning
such
a
contingency
gives
me
a
small
migraine
it
be
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
the
brain
or
the
amnesty
he
grinned
suddenly
besides
it
ca
happen
there
only
one
of
these
he
tapped
the
medallion
gently
in
existence
jery
so
we
could
have
such
a
situation
i
sank
back
into
the
contour
chair
and
glanced
at
my
watch
much
too
late
to
go
back
to
work
i
done
a
lot
in
one
day
i
reasoned
well
the
thing
was
out
of
my
hands
baxter
had
the
information
i
come
up
with
and
it
had
been
coded
and
fed
to
the
brain
as
soon
as
the
solution
came
through
i
could
be
on
my
way
back
to
the
world
of
hard
and
soft
sell
you
understand
said
baxter
suddenly
that
you
to
say
nothing
whatever
about
the
disappearance
of
the
space
scouts
until
this
office
makes
the
news
public
you
know
what
would
happen
if
this
thing
should
leak
the
intercom
on
baxter
desk
suddenly
buzzed
and
a
bright
red
light
flashed
on
ah
he
said
thumbing
a
knob
here
we
go
at
last
as
he
exerted
pressure
on
the
knob
a
thin
slit
in
the
side
of
the
intercom
began
feeding
out
a
long
sheet
of
paper
the
new
answer
from
the
brain
it
reached
a
certain
length
then
was
automatically
sheared
off
within
the
intercom
and
the
sheet
fell
gently
to
the
desktop
baxter
picked
it
up
and
swiftly
scanned
its
surface
a
look
of
dismay
overrode
his
erstwhile
genial
features
i
had
a
horrible
suspicion
not
again
i
said
softly
baxter
swore
under
his
breath
then
he
reached
across
the
desktop
and
tossed
me
the
amnesty
i
hope
you
know
what
you
doing
said
baxter
at
the
gleaming
glass
doorway
of
the
spaceport
why
a
man
who
has
absolute
authority
should
choose
to
ride
public
transportation
when
he
could
have
his
pick
of
the
fleetest
government
ships
on
earth
i
did
tell
him
it
was
because
of
little
details
like
stereovision
autobars
and
not
least
of
all
comfort
that
i
had
chosen
to
ride
the
she
sat
waiting
even
now
far
out
in
the
center
of
the
landing
strip
two
hundred
towering
feet
of
silver
crammed
with
all
the
luxuries
engineering
ingenuity
could
put
aboard
her
i
had
thanks
to
a
government
credit
card
a
private
cabin
i
intended
to
enjoy
myself
this
trip
i
managed
to
convince
baxter
that
it
was
less
likely
the
public
would
suspect
there
was
anything
amiss
if
i
went
to
mars
incognito
with
the
amnesty
worn
under
my
clothing
for
use
only
in
emergencies
an
arriving
on
mars
in
a
government
ship
might
cause
talk
disastrous
talk
baxter
was
rattling
on
and
on
giving
me
the
names
of
my
contacts
on
mars
for
the
seventeenth
time
and
i
was
giving
him
perfunctory
nods
as
though
i
was
paying
attention
though
i
was
actually
watching
the
other
passengers
leaving
the
desk
after
all
i
be
in
space
with
them
for
almost
two
days
you
never
know
what
might
develop
the
i
had
in
mind
was
a
girl
with
hair
like
irridescent
cornsilk
and
a
figure
that
made
the
stereovision
starlets
look
in
comparison
she
had
her
back
to
me
but
even
before
she
turned
around
i
knew
she
was
beautiful
it
was
just
the
way
she
stood
there
facing
the
robot
she
well
she
like
a
girl
who
is
beautiful
then
she
turned
around
and
i
gave
my
instincts
an
a
plus
her
eyes
were
the
deepest
of
blues
actually
a
purple
tone
and
they
were
wide
serious
and
shining
there
was
a
certain
determination
about
the
set
of
her
jaw
that
i
liked
and
her
lips
were
like
soft
red
velvet
a
man
could
kiss
those
lips
and
sink
slowly
into
warm
crimson
seas
lose
himself
in
the
heated
softness
of
their
gentlest
pressures
delvin
baxter
voice
shattered
my
reverie
and
i
tore
my
eyes
from
the
girl
though
the
of
dreaming
left
my
mind
in
confused
fragments
huh
i
said
looking
at
his
face
and
almost
failing
to
recognize
it
i
said
baxter
voice
was
impatient
and
over
loud
that
you
had
best
in
the
interests
of
safety
not
flash
that
amnesty
while
you
aboard
the
passengers
have
a
way
of
working
themselves
into
a
panic
that
is
almost
an
uncanny
gift
they
all
start
suspecting
their
neighbors
of
treason
or
worse
and
but
i
was
hearing
his
diatribe
any
more
as
he
spoken
that
first
sentence
the
girl
with
the
shimmering
cornsilk
hair
had
been
passing
within
a
few
feet
of
us
and
i
felt
rather
than
actually
seen
her
slender
shoulders
stiffen
beneath
the
blue
silken
fabric
of
her
blouse
and
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
in
midstep
as
though
she
were
going
to
turn
about
and
see
which
man
in
the
universe
was
the
one
to
whom
the
amnesty
had
been
given
i
watched
her
move
out
into
the
sunlight
crossing
the
field
in
brisk
but
dainty
strides
any
second
now
i
told
myself
she
thinks
she
has
been
seen
she
getting
far
enough
away
so
that
aha
now
halfway
to
the
ship
the
girl
turned
apparently
busily
concerned
about
the
clasp
of
her
handbag
as
though
it
had
come
open
without
warning
i
kept
my
head
turned
to
look
as
though
i
were
watching
baxter
but
my
eyes
were
still
on
her
she
looked
at
me
then
she
turned
and
went
on
toward
the
ship
had
to
see
who
i
was
i
said
to
myself
so
now
she
knows
i
got
the
amnesty
and
so
and
so
since
antigravity
artificial
gravity
and
were
still
in
the
realm
of
even
the
luxury
liners
like
the
had
to
bed
their
passengers
down
in
couches
until
the
ship
was
free
of
gravitation
so
it
was
until
achieved
escape
velocity
from
earth
that
i
saw
the
girl
again
i
decided
to
wander
into
the
lounge
and
try
to
locate
her
it
would
be
an
easy
task
if
she
were
present
what
with
her
startling
good
looks
but
it
turned
out
to
be
even
simpler
than
that
she
came
to
me
i
was
just
easing
myself
out
of
my
couch
when
my
cabin
door
opened
and
closed
and
locked
that
last
part
intrigued
me
even
before
i
turned
about
i
was
wondering
what
sort
of
menace
i
had
to
meet
and
bewailing
the
fact
that
the
collapser
was
still
in
my
luggage
when
i
saw
who
my
visitor
was
i
started
to
smile
but
the
smile
left
as
i
saw
the
steak
knife
in
her
hand
listen
whoever
you
are
she
said
her
voice
was
low
angrily
intense
but
still
a
pleasure
to
hear
somehow
i
listening
i
assure
you
i
said
politely
a
voice
like
yours
does
caress
these
tired
old
eardrums
every
day
she
accorded
my
compliment
a
smile
but
it
was
a
bleak
one
and
there
was
a
certain
wry
lift
to
her
left
eyebrow
very
suave
i
sure
she
said
but
i
not
in
the
mood
thank
you
now
you
just
sit
down
on
your
bunk
and
behave
and
mind
if
i
get
a
cigarette
i
asked
gesturing
toward
my
traveling
case
i
tried
to
be
casual
about
it
but
i
must
have
failed
i
lose
my
head
around
women
as
i
said
i
get
them
for
you
she
said
waving
the
knife
glittering
blade
at
me
i
moved
away
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
my
bunk
she
flicked
the
clasp
open
and
spread
the
two
halves
apart
there
were
two
shirts
and
some
underwear
in
the
case
plus
the
collapser
not
a
cigarette
to
be
seen
she
looked
at
me
i
do
smoke
i
explained
weakly
you
she
grated
between
even
white
teeth
ready
to
destroy
everybody
with
impunity
are
you
you
would
even
wait
to
find
out
what
i
wanted
i
have
said
a
word
i
pointed
out
delicately
you
lied
about
the
cigarettes
she
accused
how
would
you
treat
a
stranger
who
burst
into
your
cabin
with
an
unsheathed
knife
i
said
exasperated
she
looked
down
at
the
knife
and
reddened
maybe
i
was
a
bit
abrupt
about
this
it
just
that
her
face
suddenly
crinkled
up
and
her
deep
eyes
burst
into
tears
then
the
knife
fell
to
the
carpet
and
her
face
was
buried
in
her
hands
i
leaned
forward
and
removed
the
knife
from
within
her
reach
then
took
her
by
the
shoulders
she
whimpered
hopelessly
between
shuddering
sobs
am
i
under
arrest
depends
i
said
depends
entirely
on
why
you
came
in
here
like
this
and
what
my
possession
of
the
amnesty
has
to
do
with
it
and
how
i
added
puzzled
you
seemed
to
know
so
much
about
and
their
vile
dispositions
she
took
her
hands
from
her
face
streaked
with
tears
and
said
with
a
shy
grin
i
was
guessing
at
that
part
i
just
kind
of
assumed
all
be
pretty
intolerant
who
would
be
with
all
that
power
well
would
for
one
i
said
defensively
i
only
bite
when
bitten
she
found
a
handkerchief
somewhere
and
began
sopping
up
the
wet
spots
from
her
complexion
a
complexion
i
noted
happily
that
did
not
come
off
with
water
have
a
chair
i
said
and
rang
for
the
steward
i
hope
you
drink
not
a
lot
she
admitted
but
i
could
use
one
right
now
good
i
said
watching
her
as
she
poised
gracefully
on
the
chair
before
my
cabin
private
stereo
set
by
the
way
my
name
jery
jery
delvin
she
flushed
scarlet
again
and
said
mine
is
white
first
name
i
asked
she
paused
what
is
your
first
name
she
looked
at
the
carpet
snow
she
said
softly
for
real
i
said
like
with
the
dwarfs
she
nodded
as
one
who
been
over
the
same
conversational
ground
many
wearisome
times
in
the
past
mother
was
a
walt
disney
fan
back
in
the
age
of
movies
i
shook
my
head
and
rang
for
the
steward
again
i
think
we
both
could
use
a
drink
later
the
puzzled
steward
departed
for
the
dining
salon
to
return
the
steak
knife
which
snow
had
accidentally
picked
up
we
sipped
our
drinks
in
mutual
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
regarding
one
another
over
the
rims
of
our
tumblers
to
me
snow
was
looking
better
by
the
minute
i
even
had
a
momentary
thought
of
flashing
the
amnesty
at
her
to
see
if
those
red
velvet
lips
could
fulfill
in
a
tactile
way
the
promise
they
made
visually
but
instead
i
said
tell
me
do
you
always
attack
with
the
nearest
weapon
you
can
lay
hold
of
snow
laughed
musically
shaking
her
head
i
did
mean
to
come
in
at
full
threat
jery
she
said
softly
i
just
wanted
some
sort
of
defense
in
case
well
think
they
can
ask
of
a
person
and
she
left
the
explanation
unfinished
but
i
found
myself
glad
i
tried
pulling
rank
for
a
fast
romance
i
very
curious
to
know
just
what
you
did
come
in
here
for
snow
or
did
you
just
want
a
peep
at
the
amnesty
i
saw
you
react
when
baxter
let
it
slip
back
at
the
spaceport
is
that
who
that
was
chief
baxter
of
international
security
she
exclaimed
i
realized
i
was
blurting
things
and
sighed
damn
i
talking
too
much
snow
eyes
gave
me
the
and
she
tilted
her
head
to
one
side
curiously
you
know
jery
you
do
look
like
a
government
official
you
seem
to
be
just
an
average
man
i
thought
of
my
dossier
and
frowned
not
quite
average
i
afraid
i
can
be
hopelessly
confused
by
women
snow
digested
this
then
shrugged
like
i
said
you
seem
to
be
just
an
average
man
i
laughed
i
guess
i
better
explain
i
told
her
all
about
my
erstwhile
job
at
solar
sales
and
my
mental
bloc
regarding
females
when
i
finished
she
was
fighting
a
grin
it
was
a
losing
fight
the
grin
won
if
i
known
that
i
have
skipped
that
steak
knife
and
just
entered
in
a
bikini
she
said
you
would
have
to
go
even
that
far
i
told
her
one
friendly
wink
of
your
big
blue
eyes
and
i
be
putty
snow
raised
her
eyebrows
appraisingly
hmmm
i
have
to
remember
that
in
the
future
it
was
in
fun
but
i
caught
a
tinge
of
serious
consideration
in
it
it
gave
me
an
uneasy
feeling
a
feeling
that
brought
me
sharply
back
to
my
main
query
from
which
i
been
sidetracked
a
few
moments
before
but
you
still
have
told
me
why
you
came
in
here
to
find
you
i
figured
that
if
an
was
on
his
way
to
mars
there
was
big
trouble
and
i
think
i
know
what
the
trouble
is
but
i
need
some
of
the
answers
you
can
give
me
what
do
you
want
with
government
information
i
said
trying
to
be
stiffly
formal
and
what
makes
you
think
i
give
it
to
you
two
reasons
she
said
answering
my
last
question
first
i
can
simply
wink
a
big
blue
eye
unless
you
been
pulling
my
leg
and
get
all
the
information
i
desire
that
only
one
reason
i
said
carefully
what
else
makes
you
think
i
tell
you
the
information
snow
eyed
me
soberly
and
her
face
hovered
between
grim
determination
and
fathomless
concern
my
brother
ted
is
one
of
the
missing
space
scouts
do
pretend
snow
said
i
know
the
last
two
letters
from
ted
convinced
me
something
was
wrong
he
never
wrote
those
letters
i
thought
of
baxter
agents
sweltering
to
turn
out
perfect
facsimiles
of
children
letters
all
for
nothing
i
sighed
and
determined
to
make
one
last
effort
to
keep
the
secret
a
secret
you
imagining
things
sometimes
when
a
person
is
in
an
alien
environment
which
you
must
admit
a
strange
planet
is
their
outlook
changes
a
bit
she
was
staring
at
me
her
eyes
disconcertingly
steady
just
waiting
for
me
to
complete
my
lie
hardly
listening
to
me
i
gave
it
up
and
stopped
snow
seeing
i
was
through
unclasped
her
handbag
and
handed
me
a
letter
i
read
it
through
when
i
was
finished
i
looked
at
her
with
what
i
hoped
was
a
noncommittal
expression
see
what
i
mean
said
snow
three
in
and
terrible
spellings
of
and
but
words
like
ruins
and
civilization
come
through
perfectly
it
an
obvious
attempt
on
the
part
of
someone
to
deceive
me
i
just
know
something
wrong
why
i
drained
my
savings
account
and
took
this
flight
i
got
to
find
out
what
happened
you
could
have
gone
to
the
police
i
suggested
lamely
i
did
snow
voice
was
cold
and
flat
they
laughed
at
me
said
i
was
imagining
things
i
do
really
blame
them
all
i
have
to
go
on
is
a
hunch
that
plus
the
fact
that
ted
did
say
anything
in
our
special
code
i
closed
my
eyes
and
groaned
she
would
have
a
special
code
with
her
brother
sure
he
did
simply
overlook
it
i
tried
snow
face
was
solemnly
earnest
in
one
letter
by
the
longest
stretch
of
the
imagination
possibly
but
not
two
in
a
row
she
leaned
forward
her
eyes
housing
desperation
so
when
i
learned
that
you
an
were
aboard
i
just
knew
it
had
to
be
connected
with
whatever
happened
to
ted
there
is
something
wrong
is
there
i
hesitated
wondering
what
to
do
this
thing
was
a
tightly
kept
secret
one
which
i
sworn
to
keep
on
the
other
hand
snow
had
the
most
devastating
blue
eyes
i
shifted
in
my
position
and
felt
cold
metal
bump
lightly
against
my
chest
beneath
my
blouse
i
forgotten
about
the
amnesty
hell
i
was
the
most
influential
powerful
person
in
the
universe
was
i
if
i
wanted
to
plaster
the
secret
across
the
face
of
the
moon
no
one
had
the
authority
to
say
no
not
even
baxter
however
purple
he
might
turn
at
the
idea
could
tell
me
not
to
do
anything
and
had
i
been
picked
by
the
brain
did
that
mean
that
my
instincts
in
this
thing
would
be
the
correct
ones
i
took
one
more
look
into
her
deep
blue
eyes
and
decided
that
even
if
it
was
the
most
disastrous
thing
to
do
i
was
going
to
tell
her
the
truth
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
i
said
snow
brow
crinkled
then
the
boys
have
vanished
i
nodded
and
she
went
deathly
pale
but
do
worry
i
said
quickly
it
may
not
be
as
bad
as
we
think
what
she
gasped
fifteen
little
boys
missing
on
an
alien
planet
and
it
may
not
be
bad
are
you
out
of
your
mind
if
you
calm
down
a
bit
and
let
me
explain
i
suggested
snow
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
folded
her
arms
go
ahead
she
said
resignedly
i
told
her
about
my
being
picked
up
at
work
by
the
security
agents
of
my
meeting
with
baxter
and
of
my
investigation
of
she
listened
that
far
in
silence
then
could
hold
back
no
longer
but
what
did
you
find
in
those
lockers
and
what
does
the
takeoff
thrust
and
the
dehumidifying
system
have
to
do
with
the
disappearance
i
smiled
reassuringly
at
her
listen
snow
baxter
myself
and
probably
you
too
have
one
reaction
in
common
about
the
vanishment
from
a
ship
in
space
our
very
first
word
on
the
subject
is
an
incredulous
of
course
we
using
it
in
the
colloquial
sense
that
of
do
believe
it
but
if
we
take
it
in
its
literal
sense
we
be
absolutely
correct
such
a
thing
impossible
snow
opened
her
mouth
but
i
shushed
her
unspoken
words
with
a
wave
of
my
hand
i
know
you
about
to
spout
something
about
magnetic
grapples
and
boardings
or
even
about
long
distance
teleporting
rays
none
of
which
have
as
yet
so
far
as
we
know
been
invented
or
some
such
rot
but
what
are
the
arguments
against
these
two
solitary
possibilities
as
to
the
first
anders
the
pilot
would
surely
have
noticed
another
ship
in
his
vicinity
the
meteorite
warnings
would
have
begun
jangling
when
the
ship
was
still
hundreds
of
miles
away
and
if
it
could
somehow
evade
the
signalling
devices
anders
would
still
have
heard
the
ship
make
contact
you
ca
drive
up
in
a
spaceship
big
enough
to
hold
at
least
fifteen
boys
besides
your
own
crew
and
just
not
be
noticed
so
we
come
to
the
second
and
only
other
possibility
were
the
boys
kidnapped
by
some
ultrasuper
teleportation
beam
the
answer
of
course
is
a
resounding
no
snow
frowned
why
the
thrust
snow
that
why
if
that
weight
were
suddenly
removed
from
the
ship
boys
of
space
scout
age
usually
run
to
an
average
weight
of
one
hundred
pounds
or
in
this
case
a
total
of
about
fifteen
hundred
pounds
if
that
weight
had
suddenly
become
missing
then
anders
fuel
consumption
remaining
the
same
but
with
less
mass
to
thrust
would
have
made
him
overshoot
earth
this
however
did
not
happen
in
fact
the
gauges
in
the
pilot
compartment
plainly
show
that
the
ship
mass
was
on
landing
within
a
fraction
of
an
ounce
of
its
takeoff
mass
therefore
no
mass
at
all
was
lost
in
space
except
that
expended
by
the
consumption
of
fuel
snow
shook
her
head
bewildered
but
that
does
make
sense
she
cried
if
they
were
taken
off
the
ship
in
space
and
they
aboard
her
when
she
landed
then
all
at
once
she
got
it
and
sat
back
with
a
sharp
gasp
exactly
i
said
they
never
even
left
mars
but
you
said
that
this
man
anders
had
seen
to
it
that
they
were
all
aboard
before
takeoff
which
i
have
no
doubt
he
did
but
the
civilian
mind
skips
a
few
details
when
it
thinks
over
his
report
they
see
him
look
at
the
boys
nod
then
go
up
front
and
press
the
starter
button
it
does
happen
quite
that
simply
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
to
be
done
anders
had
to
go
into
the
pilot
cabin
strap
himself
in
place
check
the
guages
which
showed
his
course
mass
fuel
supply
thrust
control
mixture
and
a
million
and
one
other
things
he
had
to
check
the
last
and
most
important
dial
examined
before
takeoff
the
one
which
told
him
that
each
of
the
fifteen
takeoff
racks
in
the
ship
were
occupied
but
snow
cut
in
bewildered
leaning
forward
let
me
finish
she
set
her
mouth
and
sat
back
again
he
had
to
know
that
because
takeoff
thrust
on
a
human
being
snugly
in
his
padded
rack
would
probably
squash
him
to
pieces
against
a
bulkhead
so
there
had
to
be
something
in
those
racks
in
order
to
fool
anders
into
thinking
that
the
scouts
were
still
aboard
something
which
by
the
time
anders
had
maneuvered
the
ship
into
its
flight
vector
would
be
gone
without
leaving
a
trace
or
not
much
of
a
trace
unless
one
were
actually
looking
for
it
what
asked
snow
fascinated
ice
i
said
hunks
of
ice
in
every
one
of
the
fifteen
bunks
ice
which
the
temperature
control
unit
would
commence
to
melt
immediately
but
that
would
mean
ice
blocks
of
weights
they
melt
so
fast
would
anders
be
likely
to
come
back
to
the
racks
and
find
them
still
there
not
i
said
with
the
efficiency
of
the
temperature
control
system
sharp
deviations
from
comfortable
levels
in
a
spaceship
can
be
disastrous
so
the
thermostat
in
the
ship
is
set
for
a
rigid
degrees
and
it
built
to
keep
the
interior
heat
at
that
level
put
pounds
of
ice
on
board
and
the
heat
in
the
rack
cabin
goes
up
trying
to
get
the
temperature
back
to
its
correct
level
the
ice
lying
there
melting
absorbs
the
heat
swiftly
so
more
heat
is
pumped
into
the
room
well
figure
fifteen
minutes
before
all
the
ice
was
liquified
more
than
enough
of
a
margin
of
safety
safety
for
whom
snow
asked
for
whoever
did
want
anders
finding
any
evidence
of
how
the
disappearance
was
accomplished
about
an
hour
passed
between
takeoff
and
the
time
he
checked
the
cabin
you
must
remember
that
anders
had
to
maneuver
the
ship
free
of
mars
gravity
set
his
course
for
earth
and
then
make
a
final
check
of
all
his
equipment
before
going
back
into
the
ship
proper
that
takes
plenty
of
time
but
how
could
you
figure
this
out
snow
asked
her
eyes
wide
with
interest
and
where
did
the
ice
come
from
from
the
night
side
of
mars
i
said
where
the
temperature
drops
below
zero
as
soon
as
the
sun
has
gone
down
remember
the
ship
was
in
a
landing
berth
and
had
just
been
prepared
for
a
takeoff
the
technicians
would
have
moved
away
to
be
clear
of
the
blast
in
fact
they
all
be
inside
their
shacks
having
coffee
against
the
chilly
weather
they
been
exposed
to
all
it
took
was
someone
bright
enough
to
get
hold
of
the
water
tank
and
to
spray
the
water
into
any
handy
container
where
it
would
freeze
solid
in
a
few
seconds
then
the
chunks
of
ice
were
substituted
for
the
boys
in
the
bunks
and
anders
took
off
with
no
one
but
himself
on
board
you
reasoned
this
out
snow
said
incredulously
how
my
gift
for
spotting
which
i
told
you
about
once
i
knew
that
the
boys
could
not
have
been
kidnapped
from
space
and
that
something
had
to
be
making
up
for
their
mass
aboard
the
i
tried
to
think
of
this
something
could
be
kept
it
was
in
the
open
nor
in
any
of
the
storage
space
therefore
it
had
to
be
within
the
bulkheads
but
what
could
go
within
the
bulkheads
only
water
which
had
been
taken
from
the
air
to
keep
the
humidity
down
and
yet
this
water
had
to
remain
without
a
container
mind
you
in
the
fifteen
racks
at
takeoff
time
so
that
anders
dial
would
register
them
as
all
being
securely
in
place
before
he
pressed
the
starter
so
in
what
form
could
water
sit
on
a
bunk
without
a
container
snow
smiled
helplessly
ice
of
course
you
make
it
sound
almost
idiotically
simple
then
her
face
fell
but
it
only
a
theory
it
or
is
it
i
shrugged
it
seems
borne
out
by
a
few
things
snow
when
i
entered
the
i
checked
beneath
the
canvas
covering
on
one
of
the
takeoff
racks
there
was
grit
there
which
is
a
little
unusual
on
a
military
vessel
with
their
about
things
being
spic
and
span
and
water
running
through
canvas
taking
along
the
dirt
that
even
a
military
inspection
ca
find
leaves
behind
a
residue
of
grit
it
still
does
seem
enough
she
said
wistfully
as
if
begging
me
to
prove
my
theory
correct
for
her
peace
of
mind
i
was
glad
to
oblige
there
more
water
weighs
in
at
pounds
per
cubic
foot
so
fifteen
hundred
pounds
of
water
would
occupy
approximately
twenty
four
cubic
feet
the
exact
surplus
found
aboard
the
in
the
bulkhead
tubing
snow
looked
startled
but
still
unconvinced
to
kidnap
fifteen
boys
without
anders
noting
even
the
slightest
sign
of
a
struggle
or
disturbance
i
nodded
right
it
is
odd
is
it
this
bothered
me
too
until
i
checked
the
contents
of
those
storage
lockers
oh
i
forgotten
about
that
she
exclaimed
what
did
you
find
roughly
without
going
into
precise
itemization
there
were
bottles
of
space
sickness
capsules
clean
handkerchiefs
toothbrushes
packets
of
soap
and
the
like
and
the
like
snow
remarked
what
likeness
is
there
between
those
things
i
smiled
happily
and
told
her
simply
the
clinker
i
spotted
at
once
on
seeing
those
items
they
all
items
which
small
boys
hate
with
almost
apocalyptic
fury
but
i
did
not
find
such
things
as
jackknives
candy
chewing
gum
shall
i
go
on
you
mean
that
whoever
kidnapped
the
boys
took
along
the
things
which
the
boys
wanted
she
asked
her
lovely
voice
making
an
unbelieving
squeak
on
the
last
word
i
mean
i
said
softly
that
i
believe
the
space
scouts
left
the
of
their
own
free
will
by
evening
of
the
following
day
we
were
in
descent
toward
marsport
a
slow
downward
spiral
with
a
steady
braking
by
the
nose
jets
lest
we
hit
the
atmosphere
too
fast
and
burn
up
even
a
thin
atmosphere
like
that
of
mars
was
no
fun
to
enter
at
interplanetary
speeds
snow
looking
through
the
viewport
beside
her
chair
in
the
lounge
sighed
gently
and
turned
her
lovely
gaze
back
to
my
face
i
wish
she
began
softly
i
laid
my
hand
upon
hers
we
been
over
that
snow
you
must
return
to
earth
you
have
a
chance
of
finding
those
boys
hell
if
you
had
the
brain
would
have
picked
you
and
i
with
the
amnesty
can
go
anywhere
do
anything
get
results
in
a
hurry
but
if
i
came
with
you
she
pleaded
in
a
tense
whisper
i
shook
my
head
with
finality
i
told
you
over
and
over
you
wreck
my
spotter
instinct
snow
if
you
with
me
i
never
be
able
to
locate
those
boys
i
miss
even
obvious
clues
you
were
so
fuddleheaded
yesterday
when
you
told
me
how
reasoned
out
the
real
facts
about
the
disappearance
she
accused
hell
your
presence
affects
my
thinking
not
my
memory
come
on
now
see
it
my
way
will
you
i
stood
up
it
looks
like
for
a
while
snow
she
faced
me
solemnly
yes
it
does
you
be
careful
wo
you
and
you
let
me
know
if
if
i
promise
before
i
let
baxter
know
even
we
stood
like
that
a
moment
scarcely
a
foot
apart
and
i
fought
an
impulse
to
take
her
into
my
arms
then
with
no
warning
she
flung
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
i
had
my
first
taste
of
those
red
velvet
lips
then
she
was
gone
from
the
lounge
i
glanced
at
the
wall
chronometer
and
began
to
move
toward
my
cabin
in
a
hurry
less
than
five
minutes
till
i
entered
at
a
dead
run
i
barely
lashed
myself
to
the
rack
when
the
landing
thrust
began
however
i
taken
two
antipressure
tablets
as
per
the
instructions
posted
in
the
room
and
i
was
comfortably
unconscious
even
before
the
pressure
began
to
grow
when
i
awoke
there
were
two
men
in
red
and
bronze
uniforms
standing
over
my
rack
they
did
seem
very
pleased
to
find
me
there
one
of
them
had
my
bag
open
and
was
holding
my
collapser
in
his
hand
and
the
look
he
was
giving
me
was
the
cheeriest
i
ever
seen
what
are
you
guys
doing
here
i
demanded
in
speaking
i
tried
to
gesture
that
when
i
became
aware
of
the
cold
steel
manacles
on
my
wrists
what
the
hell
the
one
with
the
weapon
hefted
it
thoughtfully
in
his
palm
do
you
know
it
a
offense
to
have
possession
of
a
collapser
chum
he
said
the
other
one
not
waiting
for
my
answer
began
undoing
the
straps
across
my
body
and
assisting
me
to
my
feet
say
look
what
do
you
guys
mean
by
coming
here
and
we
were
alerted
said
the
first
man
by
an
i
simply
stared
at
him
for
an
unbelieving
instant
then
i
said
you
crazy
there
only
one
amnesty
in
existence
and
with
horrible
clarity
i
recalled
snow
impassioned
farewell
in
the
lounge
and
the
way
her
hands
had
darted
about
my
neck
i
brought
my
manacled
hands
up
to
my
blouse
and
felt
frantically
for
the
red
and
bronze
disc
the
amnesty
was
gone
come
along
now
said
the
one
who
helped
me
up
where
are
we
going
i
demanded
you
to
be
held
incommunicado
he
said
until
the
returns
come
along
now
we
have
got
all
day
day
i
said
and
looked
toward
the
viewport
sure
enough
the
glaring
martian
sunlight
was
pouring
into
the
cabin
but
we
were
landing
on
the
night
side
i
said
confused
you
did
said
the
one
with
the
collapser
only
it
was
arranged
that
you
stay
asleep
for
a
while
till
we
could
get
here
arranged
how
i
choked
furiously
then
i
remembered
the
capsules
i
taken
i
looked
toward
the
instruction
posted
on
the
inside
of
the
cabin
door
now
that
i
was
in
no
great
hurry
i
could
see
where
someone
had
with
ordinary
pen
and
ink
gone
over
the
numeral
and
made
it
into
a
passable
someone
i
thought
bitterly
with
shimmering
cornsilk
hair
and
red
velvet
lips
now
just
a
minute
you
guys
i
can
explain
i
said
stow
it
said
the
one
with
the
gun
come
on
get
moving
when
chief
baxter
hears
about
this
i
growled
he
laughed
you
know
baxter
has
no
authority
to
an
orders
once
again
he
motioned
with
the
collapser
in
the
direction
of
the
door
well
then
boys
i
said
in
as
threatening
a
tone
as
i
could
muster
let
your
fat
heads
chew
on
this
for
a
while
the
girl
who
has
that
amnesty
stole
it
from
me
you
just
get
hold
of
baxter
and
verify
it
because
if
you
do
there
are
going
to
be
two
security
agent
uniforms
for
sale
they
looked
at
each
other
frowning
then
the
one
with
the
gun
scowled
the
other
guy
paled
say
charlie
what
if
there
is
something
to
his
story
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
charlie
blinked
and
thought
hard
then
a
smile
crossed
his
face
nothing
he
said
we
were
given
orders
by
an
and
all
we
have
to
do
is
carry
them
out
to
be
in
the
clear
oh
yeah
i
grunted
five
get
you
ten
baxter
thinks
differently
the
one
who
was
charlie
hesitated
and
his
grip
hitherto
on
my
upper
arm
went
suddenly
slack
disobeying
an
is
unprecedented
he
said
carefully
so
is
the
theft
of
the
amnesty
i
shouted
in
exasperation
the
other
one
looked
at
charlie
maybe
we
ought
to
call
baxter
just
in
case
in
my
book
charlie
muttered
that
not
holding
a
guy
incommunicado
the
hell
it
not
i
snorted
i
wo
communicate
with
him
you
two
guys
do
it
do
it
any
way
you
can
square
it
with
your
sense
of
duty
either
tell
baxter
you
have
a
man
in
custody
by
the
name
of
jery
delvin
or
that
the
amnesty
is
in
the
possession
of
a
blonde
girl
and
see
what
he
says
two
hours
later
i
was
facing
the
image
of
a
chief
baxter
on
an
interplanetary
videoscreen
sorry
to
be
so
long
delvin
he
said
apologetically
but
i
left
orders
not
to
be
disturbed
anyway
i
given
the
men
instructions
to
return
the
collapser
to
you
and
an
authorization
permit
for
it
in
case
you
meet
any
more
agents
which
heaven
forbid
i
growled
no
red
tape
with
an
amnesty
ha
uh
yes
so
you
can
continue
with
your
search
delvin
have
you
found
anything
interesting
full
report
when
i
get
back
baxter
i
said
right
now
i
have
a
date
with
a
beautiful
blonde
a
date
he
choked
out
but
signing
off
i
said
and
cut
the
circuit
i
belted
the
collapser
into
place
around
my
waist
and
started
off
for
the
city
proper
somewhere
in
marsport
there
was
a
lovely
blonde
girl
named
snow
white
who
could
do
anything
anything
at
all
and
get
away
with
it
anything
but
one
thing
she
could
get
within
a
foot
of
me
again
not
if
i
had
anything
to
say
about
it
marsport
the
largest
if
you
excluded
the
prospecting
encampments
within
a
radius
of
the
place
city
on
the
planet
had
grown
fast
from
the
time
of
its
founding
in
originally
simply
a
mining
site
for
the
refining
corporation
it
had
spread
backward
from
the
area
of
the
original
mines
in
a
rough
circle
beginning
with
the
monotonous
quonset
huts
of
the
miners
and
modulating
in
its
move
toward
the
perimeter
to
smart
structures
some
of
these
thanks
to
the
earth
normal
gravity
as
high
as
fifteen
stories
the
planet
barely
half
the
diameter
of
earth
and
a
tenth
of
mass
was
a
minerologist
paradise
the
rusty
red
sands
of
the
martian
desert
were
almost
pure
ferrous
oxide
a
source
of
both
iron
for
the
profitable
refineries
and
oxygen
for
the
inhabitants
of
marsport
going
los
angeles
one
ridge
better
marsport
was
completely
circumscribed
by
high
crimson
hills
and
this
natural
bowl
formation
plus
oxygen
allowed
the
city
to
be
filled
with
breathable
atmosphere
much
as
tobacco
smoke
can
lie
surging
gently
within
an
ashtray
if
the
air
in
a
room
is
still
this
made
planetary
a
hazard
outside
the
hills
of
course
the
air
was
thin
cold
and
barely
able
to
support
life
being
comparable
to
the
biting
cold
air
atop
mount
everest
human
lungs
could
not
breathe
it
for
long
without
freezing
naturally
there
was
a
high
casualty
rate
amongst
the
prospectors
despite
their
pressurized
metal
huts
and
oxygen
masks
but
uranium
as
it
had
been
since
the
advent
of
the
atomic
age
was
enormously
to
the
one
miner
in
twenty
to
find
any
in
mars
body
breaking
hinterlands
with
its
roasting
dry
heat
of
day
and
cold
by
night
and
then
there
was
parabolite
this
mineral
found
in
abundance
beneath
the
martian
sands
was
theoretically
worth
ten
times
its
weight
in
gold
to
the
people
who
might
mine
it
i
say
theoretically
because
no
one
had
as
yet
found
a
way
of
getting
any
paradoxically
the
feature
which
made
parabolite
so
vitally
desired
was
the
same
feature
which
prevented
anyone
from
mining
it
it
was
totally
indestructible
the
name
had
been
given
it
by
the
scientists
who
studied
the
three
solitary
fragments
of
it
found
small
enough
for
shipping
back
to
earth
there
was
just
no
way
of
chipping
a
piece
loose
for
analysis
the
name
was
due
to
the
oddly
shaped
molecules
which
made
up
this
mineral
all
of
them
seemed
to
be
joined
atomically
into
perfect
parabolas
no
matter
which
way
you
came
at
them
which
meant
in
effect
that
when
anything
was
brought
to
bear
against
the
substance
pressure
which
struck
one
end
of
the
parabolically
curved
molecules
was
retransmitted
by
the
other
end
back
to
the
thing
putting
pressure
on
it
result
it
hit
back
with
a
violence
equal
to
that
applied
to
it
and
sustained
no
damage
whatsoever
to
itself
chemicals
were
tried
when
pickaxes
had
failed
but
the
substance
was
inert
it
gave
no
sign
of
reacting
either
to
hydrofluoric
acid
which
could
eat
its
way
through
glass
or
to
aqua
regia
which
could
eat
through
anything
else
they
even
tried
using
the
collapsers
on
it
these
deadly
weapons
which
worked
by
the
simple
process
of
killing
the
attraction
between
the
protons
and
electrons
could
in
the
briefest
time
reduce
anything
to
less
than
dust
the
electrons
spun
away
in
a
blinding
flash
and
the
protons
being
less
than
atomic
in
size
fell
silently
down
into
the
heart
of
the
planet
leaving
a
virtual
nothingness
where
the
object
had
been
but
on
parabolite
even
these
mighty
weapons
were
useless
oh
they
had
found
that
training
a
battery
of
them
on
a
chunk
of
parabolite
for
a
period
of
days
with
an
enormous
drain
of
power
keeping
the
weapons
firing
continuously
did
get
results
the
overall
mass
of
the
chunk
was
reduced
by
of
a
gram
which
was
less
than
useless
because
not
only
was
that
amount
completely
impractical
to
obtain
but
it
was
not
even
obtained
thanks
to
the
collapsers
destructive
potency
it
was
merely
destroyed
and
so
vast
acres
of
this
mineral
lay
all
about
the
planet
as
common
as
sandstone
was
on
earth
and
no
one
had
any
idea
of
how
to
get
any
of
it
not
even
the
natives
yes
there
were
natives
of
a
sort
on
mars
strange
beings
albeit
friendly
made
up
except
for
a
fraction
of
a
percent
of
sugar
they
were
crystalline
these
beings
covered
over
with
prisms
of
bright
red
sugar
that
gave
them
with
their
scuttling
gait
and
long
pointed
tails
the
appearance
of
lizards
a
lot
of
their
metabolism
was
a
mystery
to
us
but
we
did
know
that
they
like
plants
on
earth
lived
by
a
sort
of
modified
photosynthesis
at
first
thought
this
seems
strange
since
we
are
used
to
green
as
the
primary
necessity
in
a
photosynthetic
metabolism
but
it
made
sense
when
you
remember
that
foliage
looks
green
because
the
green
rays
of
the
sun
are
reflected
and
the
red
rays
absorbed
since
a
crystal
passes
only
the
rays
which
correspond
to
its
they
did
quite
well
photosynthetically
air
and
water
were
their
chief
foods
of
course
the
water
they
inhaled
through
hollow
tongues
which
extended
a
good
two
feet
from
their
wide
dragon
like
mouths
the
distance
was
a
necessity
due
to
their
exteriors
which
as
i
said
were
made
of
red
crystalline
sugar
they
could
take
water
on
the
inside
but
it
was
fatal
on
the
outside
the
first
men
on
mars
had
felt
pretty
silly
standing
guard
over
their
encampments
with
water
pistols
but
the
sugarfeet
as
they
came
to
be
called
proved
friendly
enough
in
a
nonobsequious
way
they
seemed
on
investigation
to
be
the
martian
equivalent
of
cats
by
that
i
mean
that
they
must
have
been
the
pets
of
the
ancient
martians
they
tended
to
be
standoffish
and
annoyingly
smug
but
not
menacing
in
any
way
after
all
why
should
they
be
menacing
we
had
nothing
they
wanted
our
food
was
useless
to
them
as
were
our
clothes
gold
or
anything
else
in
the
way
of
possessions
they
liked
our
water
of
course
but
long
evolution
in
the
martian
deserts
had
kept
their
physical
need
for
this
commodity
down
to
a
minimum
the
average
sugarfoot
drank
about
a
pint
of
water
per
week
which
was
no
menace
to
us
even
when
we
first
landed
and
water
was
in
short
supply
but
of
the
ancients
they
could
tell
us
nothing
any
more
than
an
alien
landing
on
a
depopulated
earth
could
find
out
about
men
from
an
alley
cat
we
knew
there
had
been
intelligent
life
though
there
were
remnants
of
buildings
still
to
be
seen
in
the
sands
and
bewildering
little
artifacts
for
which
no
conceivable
use
had
as
yet
been
convincingly
postulated
there
was
one
thing
though
that
bothered
us
about
these
buildings
and
artifacts
they
were
made
out
of
parabolite
how
had
the
martians
carved
or
molded
or
otherwise
affected
the
shape
of
this
indestructible
mineral
we
had
no
idea
marsport
had
a
population
of
about
one
hundred
thousand
families
averaging
five
people
to
a
family
so
it
was
a
city
for
snow
to
hide
herself
in
on
the
other
hand
i
was
absolutely
sure
just
why
i
was
looking
for
her
after
all
i
did
really
need
the
amnesty
a
collapser
carries
a
lot
of
weight
on
its
own
and
an
amnesty
power
was
only
in
proportion
to
the
esteem
in
which
an
approached
individual
held
the
authority
of
the
world
government
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
i
wondered
why
i
was
so
determined
to
find
miss
snow
white
she
only
be
a
hindrance
to
me
really
what
with
my
spotting
technique
and
a
man
on
a
mission
of
such
grave
importance
would
simply
seek
out
a
girl
because
she
had
cornsilk
hair
and
red
velvet
lips
would
he
well
would
he
as
i
thought
all
of
this
i
was
striding
swiftly
along
von
braun
street
the
main
thoroughfare
ignoring
the
stares
of
as
they
spotted
the
golden
collapser
belted
about
my
waist
passing
a
small
bar
i
happened
to
glance
in
through
the
window
and
there
was
her
photograph
on
the
stereo
over
the
bar
the
men
along
its
polished
metal
length
were
staring
at
her
with
interest
curious
and
puzzled
i
turned
back
and
went
inside
the
bar
to
hear
what
was
being
said
about
her
shoot
to
kill
repeat
shoot
to
kill
said
the
announcer
voice
from
the
speaker
she
is
not
to
be
obeyed
under
any
circumstances
the
amnesty
is
a
forgery
repeat
a
forgery
i
found
myself
leaning
weakly
against
a
wall
by
the
door
as
the
sense
of
the
message
came
home
to
me
baxter
had
lost
no
time
making
up
for
my
stupidity
in
losing
the
amnesty
he
did
dare
admit
it
had
been
stolen
because
like
myself
were
considered
by
the
populace
to
be
intelligent
and
very
clever
it
would
do
to
weaken
public
opinion
of
is
but
to
kill
from
baxter
viewpoint
it
made
sense
if
she
were
simply
shot
down
then
she
could
mention
the
fact
that
it
had
been
stolen
either
as
a
patriot
i
should
have
been
happy
to
see
my
government
operating
with
such
efficient
dispatch
for
some
reason
i
was
not
happy
at
all
i
thought
of
those
soft
warm
lips
pressing
gently
upward
upon
my
own
albeit
in
the
act
of
deception
and
felt
suddenly
sick
inside
something
for
you
buddy
i
looked
up
the
bartender
his
voice
mirroring
the
polite
caution
with
which
people
spoke
to
collapser
toters
was
down
at
my
end
of
the
bar
by
the
doorway
his
face
strained
into
a
nervously
hearty
anxiety
to
please
irritably
i
leaned
forward
to
rasp
a
negation
into
his
face
at
close
range
and
then
i
decided
to
create
no
more
ruckus
than
i
had
to
okay
i
grunted
yes
sir
he
said
spinning
about
and
commencing
to
do
dexterous
things
with
the
flashy
array
of
bottles
behind
the
bar
and
a
tall
frosty
mixer
down
the
hatch
he
smiled
setting
the
glass
of
shining
chartreuse
liquid
before
me
i
nodded
and
took
a
sip
it
was
good
whatever
it
was
it
was
a
little
like
a
stinger
and
yet
there
was
something
a
not
unpleasant
bitterish
aftertaste
the
glass
fell
from
my
suddenly
numb
fingers
and
shattered
loudly
on
the
bar
i
tried
to
get
up
and
could
the
floor
of
the
bar
was
warping
tugging
at
me
i
was
unconscious
halfway
down
my
first
awareness
was
the
whine
of
the
converters
audible
everywhere
in
marsport
if
not
by
ear
then
by
the
soles
of
one
feet
their
thundering
dynamos
plunged
potent
destructive
rays
against
the
martian
sands
leaving
in
their
wake
invisible
fountains
of
nascent
oxygen
and
shimmering
puddles
of
molten
iron
they
went
on
day
and
night
without
ceasing
partly
to
keep
the
mining
companies
on
earth
from
losing
their
franchises
with
but
primarily
to
keep
the
marsport
populace
from
tumbling
down
in
the
streets
with
cyanosed
lips
and
glazing
eyes
as
the
breathable
atmosphere
sloughed
away
over
the
hilltops
so
i
knew
that
i
was
in
marsport
at
least
but
not
much
else
my
hands
when
i
tried
to
move
them
proved
to
be
bound
and
tightly
at
that
my
fingers
felt
swollen
and
numb
when
i
tried
to
flex
them
there
was
something
a
hood
a
sack
a
cloth
over
my
head
fastened
about
my
throat
impairing
my
breathing
slightly
and
my
vision
altogether
i
found
though
that
i
could
move
my
legs
but
it
was
little
help
when
i
would
know
where
they
were
carrying
me
if
i
chanced
using
them
for
all
i
knew
i
was
lying
on
my
back
atop
a
precipice
moving
about
could
be
disastrous
so
i
lay
still
and
spent
my
time
wondering
why
that
bartender
should
have
slipped
me
a
mickey
it
was
senseless
in
a
way
i
mean
even
granting
that
there
was
some
sort
of
inimical
agency
here
attempting
to
forestall
investigation
of
the
missing
space
scouts
how
did
they
know
that
i
was
the
proper
or
that
there
was
an
around
and
knowing
this
how
would
they
know
that
i
turn
into
that
particular
bar
the
thoughts
were
too
confusing
so
i
gave
them
up
and
just
lay
there
in
darkness
worrying
and
not
strangely
enough
about
my
fate
but
about
snow
security
agents
were
and
perfect
shots
and
a
collapser
beam
was
choosy
about
what
it
annihilated
i
come
to
while
lying
on
my
back
but
had
chanced
turning
over
on
my
face
to
get
my
body
weight
off
my
hands
a
little
life
seemed
to
be
oozing
back
into
my
thickened
fingers
i
tried
the
cords
on
my
wrists
again
but
they
were
still
taut
and
firm
then
one
of
my
fingers
found
the
loose
end
of
the
cord
and
felt
its
surface
it
was
one
of
those
nylon
ropes
with
a
steel
wire
center
i
gave
up
trying
to
undo
it
how
long
had
i
been
lying
wherever
i
was
anyhow
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
it
might
have
been
an
hour
a
day
or
merely
minutes
how
far
behind
snow
trail
had
i
fallen
thanks
to
this
damnable
delay
and
did
she
know
she
was
being
hunted
i
shifted
over
onto
my
right
hip
to
feel
if
my
collapser
holster
were
still
in
place
something
pressed
back
against
me
but
it
had
too
much
give
to
it
the
holster
was
there
all
right
but
it
was
empty
obviously
i
could
do
anything
else
until
i
could
see
i
tried
catching
at
the
hooding
material
with
my
teeth
but
it
was
stretched
tautly
across
my
features
and
evaded
them
with
maddening
efficiency
on
reflection
i
saw
that
this
was
the
reason
i
had
smothered
looser
cloth
would
have
leaped
easily
to
block
mouth
and
nostrils
against
my
unconscious
breathing
i
wondered
if
the
tautness
was
an
or
purposely
done
to
ensure
my
staying
alive
that
took
me
about
three
seconds
to
figure
out
if
i
was
still
alive
then
they
wanted
me
for
something
further
if
they
had
then
the
cord
binding
the
hood
to
my
neck
would
have
been
used
as
a
simple
efficient
garrote
if
my
hands
could
reach
the
neck
cord
though
i
might
be
able
to
untie
it
and
then
try
my
hand
cords
with
my
teeth
slowly
i
managed
to
slide
my
knees
forward
until
i
was
resting
solely
on
kneecaps
and
chin
then
i
twisted
stretched
and
tugged
with
my
arms
until
the
binding
cord
slipped
over
my
rump
and
slid
to
the
backs
of
my
knees
my
chin
from
all
the
weight
on
it
felt
as
though
it
had
been
kicked
by
a
fullback
but
i
ignored
the
pain
and
flopped
awkwardly
over
onto
my
side
then
rolled
carefully
onto
my
back
with
my
ankles
somewhere
over
my
face
now
came
the
rough
part
i
found
myself
in
the
next
five
minutes
of
torture
wishing
i
done
more
exercises
in
my
erstwhile
sedentary
life
the
cord
slipped
down
as
far
as
the
tendons
behind
my
heels
but
would
budge
no
further
no
matter
how
i
strained
with
my
boots
off
i
might
have
made
the
last
inch
or
so
but
they
were
on
and
had
thick
durex
heels
it
was
going
to
be
a
struggle
when
it
happened
it
happened
all
at
once
i
was
wrenching
at
my
bonds
gritting
my
teeth
and
pulling
despite
the
binding
agony
that
flared
in
my
wrists
and
then
i
smacked
myself
in
the
face
with
my
own
hands
as
my
feet
jackknifed
back
to
the
ground
i
lay
there
panting
awhile
then
started
feeling
about
my
neck
for
the
end
of
the
cord
fastening
the
hood
in
place
my
fingers
thicker
than
ever
after
my
struggles
were
almost
without
the
power
to
feel
as
i
fumbled
them
against
the
knot
in
the
cord
in
their
bloated
state
they
were
just
slightly
more
manageable
than
sausages
i
let
them
work
by
touch
and
kept
my
mind
away
from
what
they
were
doing
lest
i
begin
to
scream
in
frustration
at
their
bumbling
efforts
then
something
slipped
and
gave
way
the
bottom
folds
of
the
hooding
cloth
fell
open
from
my
throat
i
fairly
tore
the
thing
from
my
head
and
looked
around
me
there
was
much
light
to
see
by
just
a
pallid
gray
glow
in
the
air
but
i
could
tell
i
was
in
a
cellar
of
some
sort
the
walls
had
that
dusty
look
to
them
and
there
was
a
flight
of
stone
stairs
going
up
toward
a
door
under
which
seeped
a
dim
sheet
of
light
i
started
looking
around
for
some
other
way
out
there
was
none
visible
although
i
could
see
too
much
outside
the
area
where
that
dim
light
struck
and
diffused
before
vanishing
into
darkness
i
licked
my
lips
took
in
some
deep
draughts
of
air
then
began
dulling
my
incisors
on
the
wrist
cords
the
knot
unfortunately
was
on
the
ulnar
side
of
the
wrists
just
behind
the
little
fingers
the
only
way
i
could
get
at
that
was
to
bend
my
hands
tightly
up
to
my
neck
as
though
i
were
about
to
choke
myself
and
work
over
the
underside
of
my
wrists
it
was
awkward
as
hell
but
finally
that
cord
too
dropped
away
and
i
was
free
well
relatively
free
i
did
know
how
my
chances
were
of
getting
out
of
that
cellar
or
whatever
it
was
while
it
was
probably
only
setting
myself
up
for
a
return
to
my
bonds
i
decided
to
do
the
obvious
thing
and
head
up
that
flight
of
stairs
but
before
i
did
so
i
scouted
around
for
some
sort
of
weapon
on
a
pile
of
empty
crates
i
located
a
pair
of
shears
the
sort
used
to
snip
through
the
metal
tape
that
binds
bulky
crates
like
those
it
much
and
was
clumsy
to
hold
but
it
was
all
i
had
so
i
took
it
along
with
me
creeping
up
the
stairs
i
found
the
door
locked
from
the
outside
but
it
was
a
operated
lock
the
kind
that
can
be
opened
from
the
inside
by
simply
turning
the
knob
apparently
my
captors
were
less
concerned
about
me
getting
out
than
they
were
about
anyone
else
getting
in
it
figured
though
i
was
supposed
to
be
unconscious
hooded
and
bound
shutting
the
door
behind
me
i
found
myself
in
a
corridor
not
itself
lighted
but
getting
light
from
somewhere
at
the
far
end
as
i
moved
cautiously
down
its
length
i
was
thankful
for
the
treeless
martian
topography
which
had
occasioned
all
edifices
being
built
of
metal
stone
there
was
a
chance
of
my
making
the
floor
creak
i
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
paused
behind
the
edge
of
an
open
door
through
which
the
light
came
streaming
and
there
were
voices
too
voices
and
odd
clacking
noises
gingerly
i
lowered
myself
all
the
way
to
the
flooring
and
peeked
around
the
very
bottom
of
the
door
frame
below
i
hoped
the
eye
level
of
anyone
in
that
room
it
was
i
saw
the
bar
in
which
i
been
mickeyed
but
long
opaque
blinds
were
latched
in
place
over
the
windows
and
glass
door
and
the
people
in
the
place
did
seem
to
be
customers
some
of
them
were
seated
on
the
barstools
and
some
on
the
bar
itself
others
occupied
tables
and
chairs
along
the
wall
opposite
the
bar
all
were
facing
the
area
between
the
bar
and
the
tables
in
which
was
set
another
table
there
was
a
man
seated
at
it
a
man
and
something
else
it
was
this
something
else
which
was
emitting
the
clacking
noises
heard
i
looked
with
fascinated
horror
at
its
long
face
and
eyes
it
had
no
hair
nor
could
i
discern
anything
like
ears
until
it
turned
its
head
and
i
saw
the
hole
just
behind
the
back
edge
of
the
jaw
the
overhead
light
as
this
creature
turned
its
head
glinted
red
off
squarish
conical
scales
and
i
realized
with
a
little
shock
that
i
was
seeing
my
first
sugarfoot
seen
in
the
flesh
as
it
were
it
looked
considerably
more
menacing
than
the
photos
i
seen
of
it
back
on
earth
at
that
cosmic
distance
i
could
believe
that
it
was
docile
albeit
standoffish
and
was
while
not
a
friend
to
man
at
least
an
accepted
neutral
but
looking
at
those
eyes
and
teeth
i
decided
the
public
information
bureau
on
earth
was
full
of
beans
that
damned
thing
looked
dangerous
as
i
watched
it
made
some
more
clacking
noises
and
the
man
beside
it
whom
i
recognized
as
the
bartender
frowned
and
clacked
something
back
his
sounds
did
have
the
same
snapping
quality
to
them
but
i
could
doubt
they
were
conversing
in
some
language
which
language
just
had
to
be
the
sugarfoot
and
that
was
another
thing
the
pib
on
earth
had
mentioned
contact
between
man
and
sugarfoot
was
supposed
to
be
impossible
except
in
the
form
of
rudimentary
gestures
they
were
supposed
to
be
able
to
learn
to
follow
certain
earth
words
if
you
dinned
them
at
them
often
enough
but
that
was
all
now
here
was
an
earthman
talking
to
one
it
make
interesting
news
for
baxter
when
i
got
back
if
i
got
back
the
bartender
in
the
course
of
his
speech
pointed
at
something
on
the
table
before
him
and
shook
his
head
i
raised
up
slowly
on
my
hands
from
my
prone
position
and
got
a
glimpse
of
the
object
under
discussion
it
was
my
collapser
goldenly
glinting
in
the
incandescent
light
just
from
following
the
bartender
gestures
and
facial
expressions
i
began
to
gather
some
of
what
was
going
on
i
did
know
why
but
they
seemed
to
be
dickering
over
possession
of
the
weapon
and
unless
i
misjudged
the
man
pointing
in
the
direction
of
where
that
stone
cellar
lay
i
too
was
on
the
auction
block
the
way
i
figured
it
this
sugarfoot
wanted
me
and
it
wanted
the
collapser
the
bartender
seemed
willing
enough
to
surrender
me
but
was
nixing
a
deal
on
the
weapon
the
drawn
blinds
and
the
men
lowered
voices
indicated
that
it
must
be
nightfall
i
started
out
into
marsport
at
midday
the
rotation
of
the
planet
is
only
fractionally
different
from
earth
so
that
meant
that
at
least
six
hours
had
gone
by
since
my
capture
but
a
bar
closing
down
at
sunset
just
when
its
business
would
begin
picking
up
would
look
pretty
suspicious
so
i
could
figure
on
probably
another
six
hours
putting
the
time
at
somewhere
past
midnight
i
wished
i
could
leave
with
the
collapser
but
i
had
my
doubts
that
i
could
cross
the
floor
of
that
room
to
snatch
it
from
the
table
without
being
grabbed
by
someone
i
shook
my
head
and
withdrew
back
into
the
corridor
to
think
no
point
in
risking
my
life
to
get
that
weapon
back
when
i
could
simply
slip
out
some
other
way
and
alert
is
a
team
of
agents
could
reduce
the
bar
to
a
sparkling
crater
in
seconds
along
with
the
men
sugarfoot
and
collapser
it
would
be
quite
as
glorious
as
acting
the
hero
by
myself
but
be
considerably
safer
i
got
back
to
my
feet
and
started
inspecting
the
rest
of
the
corridor
seeking
a
less
populated
exit
than
the
one
onto
von
braun
street
back
the
way
i
come
there
was
only
the
door
to
that
cellar
i
doubled
back
toward
the
other
door
by
the
bar
itself
ducked
down
low
and
scuttled
past
it
on
my
hands
and
knees
no
outcry
came
from
the
room
just
the
vociferous
clacking
noises
and
an
occasional
mutter
from
one
of
the
surrounding
men
i
figured
i
made
it
okay
the
corridor
bent
just
past
that
doorway
and
ended
in
a
window
it
was
open
i
stuck
my
head
out
and
looked
around
something
was
glowing
just
beneath
me
something
that
reflected
almost
intolerable
heat
against
my
face
when
i
looked
down
at
it
a
river
of
liquified
iron
ten
feet
wide
ran
along
a
bed
carved
into
the
rocky
soil
it
was
a
good
five
feet
between
the
bottom
of
the
window
and
the
sullen
smolder
of
that
hellish
stream
but
my
face
and
throat
felt
already
parboiled
before
ducking
back
into
the
relatively
cooler
temperature
inside
the
corridor
i
shot
a
glance
toward
the
source
of
this
impassable
moat
and
understood
why
it
was
there
about
two
miles
along
this
radiant
river
i
saw
the
towering
metallic
hulk
of
the
converters
their
shimmering
rays
leaping
from
a
sender
plate
to
a
receiver
and
silhouetted
against
the
black
velvet
night
sky
above
and
between
these
deadly
twins
was
a
monster
escalator
carrying
ton
after
ton
of
rich
red
martian
sand
to
a
point
in
space
directly
above
the
flashing
beam
and
spilling
it
downward
through
the
raw
energy
below
where
the
sand
pure
ferrous
oxide
struck
the
beam
i
could
not
look
without
daring
blindness
so
violent
were
those
disruptive
reactions
but
just
above
it
a
silvery
cloud
arose
and
dissipated
itself
the
freed
oxygen
enriching
the
atmosphere
in
this
gigantic
crater
that
was
marsport
and
below
it
a
cataract
of
burning
metal
sprayed
downward
into
an
enormous
vat
the
sides
of
which
were
spouting
a
continual
flow
of
this
dangerous
liquid
into
troughs
which
spread
out
in
a
fanlike
pattern
that
must
have
encompassed
the
entire
city
it
took
me
a
few
minutes
of
thought
but
i
figured
it
out
as
i
drew
back
through
the
window
from
the
heat
it
was
not
enough
that
the
converters
could
supply
the
citizenry
with
breathable
air
the
planetary
temperature
at
night
was
below
the
level
at
which
a
man
could
live
save
with
the
most
cumbersome
demanding
precautions
such
as
are
demanded
by
arctic
exploration
on
earth
and
so
instead
of
merely
letting
the
metal
cool
into
ingots
before
it
was
shipped
where
it
was
needed
it
was
channeled
through
the
city
passing
behind
all
the
buildings
where
alleys
would
normally
be
and
warming
the
environment
so
that
going
into
the
night
air
would
not
mean
sure
death
by
freezing
i
could
not
see
the
far
end
of
the
trough
but
i
knew
that
beyond
the
city
limits
the
troughs
would
converge
and
iron
would
be
cooled
shaped
and
shipped
it
was
ingenious
and
something
i
never
run
across
in
my
readings
about
mars
but
then
i
was
never
much
of
a
space
exploration
fan
however
ingenious
or
not
it
was
a
crumby
trick
on
me
really
i
had
a
chance
of
passing
through
that
rushing
inferno
outside
that
left
me
one
way
out
through
the
front
door
hefting
the
wirecutter
in
my
hand
and
breathing
a
silent
prayer
i
moved
back
to
that
open
doorway
things
when
i
peeked
out
seemed
no
more
advanced
man
and
sugarfoot
were
still
clacking
away
at
one
another
neither
side
giving
ground
however
the
other
men
round
about
were
showing
signs
of
restlessness
why
ya
just
blast
him
jim
and
forget
it
suggested
an
oldster
just
over
to
my
left
jim
the
bartender
faced
the
other
men
with
a
black
scowl
furious
at
the
interruption
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
barry
you
know
these
things
can
understand
a
little
english
the
older
man
barry
subsided
with
a
sullen
look
at
jim
and
i
turned
my
gaze
there
to
see
what
would
happen
next
i
quite
overlooked
the
fact
that
jim
looking
toward
barry
had
sent
his
eyes
in
the
general
direction
of
the
corridor
and
that
i
was
leaning
my
fool
head
around
the
doorway
jim
was
looking
right
at
me
his
mouth
wide
open
hey
he
cried
leaping
to
his
feet
and
pointing
with
such
violence
that
his
chair
crashed
to
the
floor
he
loose
i
took
a
step
back
as
the
entire
roomful
of
men
jumped
up
and
turned
to
face
me
my
mind
leaped
about
like
a
fish
flung
alive
onto
a
skillet
trying
to
make
some
sensible
decision
should
i
chance
flinging
myself
over
that
red
hot
river
outside
or
rush
back
to
the
deadend
of
the
cellar
neither
course
seemed
very
profitable
somehow
but
my
time
was
running
out
after
the
first
startled
pause
at
seeing
me
there
the
group
came
at
me
in
a
rapid
scuttle
hands
outstretched
to
take
me
so
none
of
them
ever
saw
what
i
saw
facing
into
the
room
the
sight
they
missed
was
one
which
sent
me
diving
to
my
left
to
fall
prone
on
the
corridor
floor
hugging
the
raw
stone
there
and
clamping
my
eyes
shut
i
heard
that
terrible
throbbing
buzz
in
that
bar
room
and
then
my
skin
prickled
and
stung
as
an
segment
of
the
wall
above
me
vanished
into
a
cloud
of
white
sparks
when
i
at
last
lifted
myself
carefully
for
a
look
the
sugarfoot
was
gone
gone
with
the
collapser
i
seen
it
snatch
up
from
that
table
when
jim
guard
was
down
and
the
men
were
gone
too
gone
with
most
of
the
wall
half
the
bar
and
a
large
quantity
of
chairs
and
tables
a
collapser
is
nothing
to
fool
with
the
sugarfoot
must
have
flicked
it
on
and
sent
the
beam
in
a
sweeping
curve
that
turned
everything
it
touched
into
hot
protons
and
electrical
energy
he
turned
it
off
however
as
soon
as
the
last
man
vanished
from
his
ken
i
realized
with
a
sick
feeling
of
shock
that
a
second
more
energy
would
have
dissolved
the
back
wall
and
i
would
have
been
buried
beneath
a
flood
of
molten
iron
when
i
got
outside
there
was
no
sign
of
the
sugarfoot
along
the
street
in
fact
there
was
no
sign
of
anyone
marsport
despite
the
caloric
values
of
the
heating
troughs
is
still
pretty
chilly
at
night
i
gathered
no
one
went
out
much
or
that
this
was
a
slack
night
for
the
local
merchants
because
even
the
stores
were
closed
and
the
public
stereovision
auditorium
was
shut
down
too
it
was
eerie
walking
down
that
rocky
street
with
no
sound
but
that
of
my
durex
heels
smacking
the
ground
to
left
and
right
dark
shuttered
windows
moved
by
as
i
advanced
my
nose
still
felt
irritated
by
the
good
whiff
of
ozone
it
had
inhaled
when
the
sugarfoot
cut
loose
with
the
collapser
and
i
was
rubbing
the
tip
of
it
with
the
back
of
my
wrist
when
i
saw
a
figure
down
the
street
facing
toward
me
it
seemed
to
be
a
man
but
his
figure
was
lost
in
the
deep
shadows
thrown
by
the
glow
of
the
distant
converter
i
kept
moving
toward
him
but
slowed
my
pace
there
was
something
in
his
attitude
that
i
did
like
he
was
waiting
there
for
me
i
realized
with
a
small
shock
and
i
sensed
his
intentions
were
the
best
possible
while
moving
toward
him
i
started
darting
my
eyes
about
me
to
see
if
there
were
some
way
of
getting
off
the
street
but
the
buildings
were
all
with
one
another
and
shut
tight
i
could
of
course
hurl
myself
through
the
glass
front
of
one
but
assuming
i
did
brain
myself
on
the
blinds
in
the
process
what
then
all
these
places
were
backed
by
that
infernal
molten
river
there
be
no
escape
and
then
my
eyes
saw
something
that
sent
brazen
alarm
bells
clanging
through
my
nervous
system
in
the
entrance
of
one
store
the
glass
curved
at
a
degree
angle
to
my
line
of
movement
and
reflected
in
its
depths
i
could
see
the
broad
avenue
behind
me
it
was
filled
with
creeping
figures
i
spun
about
with
an
involuntary
cry
and
looked
at
them
head
on
it
was
a
group
of
men
armed
with
rude
weapons
mostly
clubs
but
a
few
glittering
knives
and
they
were
obviously
after
me
as
soon
as
they
knew
i
spotted
them
they
left
all
pretense
of
stealth
and
came
at
me
in
a
run
brandishing
their
weapons
i
staggered
back
one
frightened
step
then
turned
and
ran
down
the
street
like
a
madman
not
one
of
them
however
was
making
a
sound
only
their
heavy
footfalls
told
me
they
were
still
in
earnest
pursuit
as
i
stumbled
up
the
street
toward
that
solitary
waiting
figure
in
the
shadows
it
was
like
a
nightmare
the
relentless
pursuers
chasing
one
down
an
endless
avenue
with
no
turnoff
my
ribs
ached
with
panicky
breathing
and
my
vision
was
swimming
giddily
as
i
came
to
where
the
solitary
figure
stood
here
we
go
i
said
to
myself
now
he
steps
out
and
stops
me
and
i
too
winded
to
put
up
a
fight
as
i
came
nearly
abreast
of
the
figure
it
stepped
out
into
the
glow
that
glared
from
the
converter
brilliant
light
coruscated
over
glassy
scales
as
it
moved
out
into
the
avenue
in
a
queer
scuttling
motion
the
sugarfoot
i
knew
it
was
the
same
one
my
collapser
was
still
clutched
in
its
hand
blindly
i
shot
my
arms
in
front
of
me
to
wrest
the
thing
from
its
grasp
but
it
simply
tossed
the
gun
into
its
other
hand
and
with
the
free
hand
caught
me
by
the
collar
and
held
on
then
a
humming
blaze
filled
the
avenue
for
a
split
second
and
i
got
my
second
whiff
of
ozone
that
night
the
sugarfoot
released
me
and
i
fell
to
the
street
panting
i
managed
to
lift
my
head
and
look
back
toward
where
my
pursuers
had
been
they
were
gone
i
raised
myself
on
my
hands
and
looked
up
into
the
scaly
face
of
my
rescuer
wary
and
alert
but
the
sugarfoot
had
lowered
the
collapser
and
was
menacing
me
with
it
why
did
you
kill
those
men
i
asked
bewildered
it
flickered
out
a
tongue
that
resembled
a
segment
of
hollow
rubber
tubing
and
made
some
clacking
noises
i
shook
my
head
the
thing
ceased
making
noises
and
tried
sign
language
instead
it
pointed
toward
where
the
men
had
been
then
pointed
at
me
you
mean
i
said
slowly
you
annihilated
those
men
simply
because
they
were
after
me
the
thing
did
change
expression
i
did
really
see
how
it
could
what
with
its
rigid
crystalline
structure
but
it
gave
a
slow
nod
it
seemed
to
have
difficulty
doing
it
as
though
it
were
used
to
that
particular
form
of
expression
but
why
i
said
getting
to
my
feet
and
staring
at
the
creature
why
go
to
these
lengths
to
protect
me
is
there
something
special
about
me
again
the
ponderous
nod
then
the
sugarfoot
pointed
at
me
and
pointed
at
its
head
i
simply
shook
my
head
it
did
the
action
again
patiently
because
i
smart
i
choked
not
really
thinking
this
was
the
case
the
lumpy
red
head
moved
from
right
to
left
and
back
to
center
again
then
what
i
demanded
it
looked
about
suddenly
then
pointed
to
the
ground
and
shook
its
head
again
not
here
you
mean
the
sugarfoot
nodded
then
raised
a
hand
and
beckoned
you
want
me
to
come
with
you
is
that
it
i
said
it
nodded
with
less
patience
and
moved
off
a
few
paces
when
i
did
go
with
it
it
turned
to
face
me
again
and
gave
its
head
a
questioning
tilt
because
i
answered
its
unspoken
question
i
do
know
if
i
can
trust
you
that
why
it
stared
at
me
with
its
eyes
for
a
second
then
pointed
to
the
empty
space
in
the
street
then
to
the
collapser
and
nodded
i
i
should
trust
you
because
you
did
use
the
collapser
on
me
because
if
your
motives
were
bad
you
would
already
have
destroyed
me
the
sugarfoot
nodded
violently
i
said
backing
off
not
a
chance
you
tell
me
why
and
maybe
i
come
along
but
not
before
even
as
i
said
it
i
felt
regret
for
my
own
irrationality
were
its
intentions
even
the
best
it
could
certainly
not
prove
them
to
me
or
even
demonstrate
its
reasons
with
the
language
barrier
between
us
it
stood
there
looking
at
me
apparently
thinking
hard
we
seemed
to
be
at
an
impasse
i
did
want
to
go
with
it
on
the
other
hand
i
did
want
it
to
go
off
and
leave
me
with
the
most
baffling
mystery
of
my
life
unsolved
i
had
to
know
why
it
had
spared
me
and
what
it
wanted
but
an
alien
on
a
strange
planet
with
that
dragonish
form
and
the
full
of
teeth
not
to
mention
a
thick
tail
i
could
bring
myself
to
trust
it
at
that
moment
there
was
a
shout
down
the
street
and
a
flashing
light
someone
was
coming
probably
i
realized
an
instant
later
the
security
men
from
the
rocket
field
they
had
a
gadget
there
that
could
not
only
spot
but
track
down
any
use
of
atomic
energy
in
the
region
and
there
had
been
within
ten
minutes
of
each
other
two
such
uses
of
that
collapser
the
sugarfoot
took
a
step
backward
hold
on
i
said
these
guys
are
okay
maybe
after
i
get
a
tranquillizer
i
be
more
in
the
mood
for
coming
with
you
if
just
wait
a
moment
but
the
sugarfoot
was
having
none
of
it
it
gave
me
an
angry
glance
then
before
i
could
dodge
it
grabbed
my
arm
i
went
to
pull
away
then
saw
that
it
was
trying
to
tell
me
something
the
fingers
not
holding
my
arm
were
indicating
my
wrist
it
took
me
a
second
to
catch
on
wrist
wristwatch
a
swift
nod
time
of
some
sort
another
you
you
come
for
me
at
a
later
time
a
very
brief
nod
then
a
surprisingly
friendly
clasp
of
those
clawlike
fingers
on
my
shoulder
then
with
a
bound
that
took
my
breath
away
the
sugarfoot
sprang
upward
from
the
street
and
landed
on
the
rooftop
of
one
of
the
nearby
stores
it
landed
running
and
as
i
watched
it
reached
the
rear
of
the
store
and
took
a
soaring
leap
out
over
the
molten
river
between
it
and
the
next
rooftop
then
it
vanished
into
the
blackness
beyond
the
trough
alley
i
turned
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
security
men
charlie
and
the
other
security
agent
whose
name
turned
out
to
be
foster
sat
stolidly
listening
as
i
recounted
events
since
i
last
seen
them
you
say
charlie
interrupted
with
a
frown
this
here
sugarfoot
told
you
why
he
did
shoot
you
down
not
quite
i
said
he
did
seem
to
have
the
time
but
he
said
see
me
l
look
delvin
that
not
what
i
mean
everybody
from
mars
to
venus
knows
that
the
sugarfoots
are
dumb
animals
so
i
like
to
know
what
you
trying
to
hand
us
there
was
something
funny
in
his
tone
as
though
he
were
saying
not
it
ca
be
true
but
it
not
supposed
to
be
true
and
that
the
way
things
stay
i
paused
considering
i
had
a
hard
time
for
a
while
when
i
was
first
picked
up
but
i
been
able
to
get
myself
brought
by
the
men
who
found
me
to
charlie
and
foster
after
giving
charlie
name
and
describing
the
two
they
identified
me
and
gotten
me
off
the
hook
for
the
damage
to
that
bar
it
was
damage
possible
only
by
a
collapser
and
i
of
course
had
been
picked
up
wearing
a
collapser
holster
but
from
the
time
i
been
left
with
them
there
was
a
bothersome
something
about
their
attitude
an
impatience
as
though
they
had
something
to
say
to
me
or
even
do
to
me
but
had
to
hold
off
until
i
was
through
he
told
me
by
sign
language
i
said
he
made
a
gesture
and
i
interpreted
it
nothing
baffling
in
that
is
there
foster
gave
me
a
stare
as
though
suppressing
anger
then
he
said
tell
me
mister
delvin
just
what
is
the
sign
for
must
go
now
but
i
see
you
at
a
later
time
i
took
a
deep
breath
and
controlled
myself
look
i
was
picked
for
this
job
because
i
have
a
gift
for
interpretation
or
deduction
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
if
you
such
a
hotshot
charlie
snapped
how
come
you
did
get
suspicious
when
that
bartender
was
forcing
free
drinks
on
you
any
sap
would
expected
a
mickey
with
the
guy
acting
like
that
the
reason
i
said
stiffly
hating
to
admit
my
mental
weakness
is
that
at
that
particular
moment
the
picture
of
miss
snow
white
was
on
the
stereo
that
why
i
i
do
function
properly
when
there
are
women
about
charlie
and
foster
exchanged
a
look
and
both
shrugged
i
felt
a
hot
blush
of
embarrassment
and
anger
burning
upon
my
face
and
that
the
story
i
finished
stubbornly
charlie
heaved
himself
lazily
to
his
feet
what
do
you
think
foster
foster
emulating
the
same
lazy
motion
looked
thoughtful
for
a
second
then
nodded
i
think
that
all
we
going
to
get
come
on
stash
him
away
stash
me
away
i
cried
indignantly
what
the
hell
are
you
talking
about
you
going
into
a
nice
cell
buddy
said
charlie
an
ugly
smile
on
his
face
and
you
be
let
out
when
the
time
comes
so
quit
your
bellyaching
and
come
on
it
be
easier
if
you
do
try
to
get
rough
you
ca
arrest
me
i
said
i
or
i
should
be
the
it
was
as
if
they
had
heard
me
come
on
come
on
said
foster
crooking
a
finger
at
me
you
guys
ca
pull
this
kind
of
trick
i
said
when
chief
baxter
hears
about
this
charlie
and
foster
threw
back
their
heads
and
laughed
so
funny
i
asked
a
dreadful
inkling
growing
inside
my
mind
the
door
opened
and
a
third
security
man
walked
in
it
was
chief
philip
baxter
he
gave
me
a
tolerant
smile
they
laughing
delvin
he
said
smoothly
because
i
gave
the
order
for
your
arrest
the
cell
was
of
cold
martian
stone
and
had
no
window
i
sat
miserable
on
the
thin
cot
provided
for
me
and
pondered
all
that
had
happened
to
me
in
the
last
few
days
none
of
it
made
the
slightest
sense
to
me
not
my
selection
by
the
brain
nor
my
arrest
by
men
it
was
crazy
baxter
when
i
demanded
to
know
the
reason
for
his
duplicity
had
merely
said
you
served
your
purpose
and
then
charlie
and
foster
had
taken
me
away
their
collapser
muzzles
forming
unarguable
persuaders
against
my
spine
i
did
even
give
a
moment
consideration
to
thoughts
of
escape
i
was
in
a
security
prison
and
a
security
prison
at
that
the
door
to
my
cell
was
a
massive
stone
which
swung
into
place
on
ponderous
hinges
and
sealed
by
making
a
in
the
circular
entrance
air
was
provided
through
vents
vents
which
could
be
closed
off
if
the
prisoner
showed
signs
of
aggressive
tendencies
a
few
hours
without
air
made
most
men
pretty
docile
i
wondered
how
long
i
sit
there
before
they
fed
me
or
if
they
would
feed
me
at
all
hell
no
one
knew
i
was
on
mars
my
last
contact
with
my
regular
associates
had
been
my
to
marge
at
the
office
for
all
anyone
knew
i
been
arrested
for
anarchy
or
something
i
knew
with
a
cold
sinking
feeling
that
no
one
would
even
ask
about
me
security
had
taken
me
security
was
good
for
the
country
and
security
never
made
mistakes
topic
closed
jery
delvin
written
off
as
an
uninteresting
memory
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
do
but
think
so
i
did
a
lot
of
it
i
noted
with
chagrin
that
they
had
removed
my
belt
or
socks
i
could
if
i
so
desired
escape
my
fate
by
simply
knotting
them
into
a
cord
and
passing
one
end
through
the
overhead
air
grillwork
and
the
other
about
my
neck
maybe
that
was
the
reason
why
they
taken
them
i
had
a
distinct
feeling
a
feeling
that
whether
i
died
by
my
own
hand
or
of
claustrophobia
made
little
difference
to
baxter
and
his
boys
i
folded
my
hands
behind
my
head
and
sank
back
onto
the
hard
cot
puzzling
over
everything
that
had
happened
to
me
the
brain
selects
me
as
the
key
figure
in
the
finding
of
the
missing
space
scouts
fine
so
far
just
what
my
duties
are
it
does
say
but
i
the
man
for
the
job
whatever
it
is
okay
so
baxter
hands
over
the
amnesty
i
get
a
preliminary
lead
from
anders
the
pilot
of
the
scouts
i
take
off
for
mars
to
find
the
kids
who
seem
to
have
left
of
their
own
volition
swell
only
a
cute
blonde
by
the
unlikely
name
of
snow
white
filches
the
amnesty
and
nearly
has
me
tossed
in
prison
except
that
baxter
still
on
my
side
gets
me
loose
i
take
off
looking
for
snow
and
get
mickeyed
in
a
martian
bar
then
then
things
start
getting
confusing
i
get
loose
and
come
upon
a
sort
of
council
of
earthmen
dickering
with
a
sugarfoot
a
supposedly
dumb
animal
for
me
and
my
collapser
i
get
spotted
the
men
try
to
snatch
me
and
they
all
get
vaporized
by
the
sugarfoot
who
runs
off
i
follow
and
next
thing
another
mob
is
on
my
heels
same
bit
with
the
sugarfoot
zzzzzzurp
no
more
men
only
this
time
it
does
run
off
it
dallies
a
bit
and
tries
to
get
me
to
go
somewhere
with
it
why
it
has
suddenly
decided
to
take
me
along
i
do
know
because
it
had
the
opportunity
much
earlier
when
it
made
its
first
massacre
however
i
decline
the
invitation
and
like
a
good
boy
report
all
events
to
security
upshot
i
am
stashed
in
a
solid
rock
cell
possibly
never
to
emerge
alive
i
lay
there
pondering
these
facts
one
thing
seemed
clear
i
did
know
the
angles
what
was
snow
angle
or
baxter
or
the
sugarfoot
or
the
mob
hell
what
was
mine
i
snorted
and
sat
up
rubbing
my
neck
i
had
a
headache
coming
on
and
it
felt
like
the
start
of
a
migraine
an
occupational
hazard
with
ad
men
i
tried
rotating
my
head
on
my
neck
a
good
relaxer
for
those
tensed
neck
muscles
and
then
i
noticed
that
i
was
perspiring
like
mad
and
that
my
throat
felt
hot
inside
with
a
sick
apprehension
i
sprang
up
and
thrust
my
nose
near
the
grill
on
the
wall
nothing
i
tried
poking
a
finger
between
the
latticework
it
was
stopped
by
a
metal
plate
the
grill
was
sealed
off
in
that
tiny
cell
i
had
maybe
two
hours
more
of
breathing
time
after
that
well
i
would
be
feeling
my
headache
any
more
i
sat
down
on
the
cot
once
more
and
scowled
at
the
floor
i
was
tired
of
puzzles
but
even
this
did
make
sense
why
take
the
time
and
trouble
to
smother
me
a
collapser
could
wipe
me
off
the
slate
in
seconds
no
annoying
corpus
delicti
cluttering
up
the
premises
not
even
a
bit
of
fingernail
left
nothing
to
incriminate
the
murderers
so
they
smother
me
but
why
kill
me
for
heaven
sake
it
could
be
to
keep
me
from
telling
what
i
knew
i
did
know
a
damned
thing
except
that
baxter
motive
unknown
must
have
left
earth
immediately
after
i
spoke
to
him
on
that
interplanetary
or
was
it
interplanetary
come
to
think
of
it
he
could
been
in
the
next
room
when
i
talked
to
him
damn
it
was
baffling
why
he
had
simply
told
me
that
it
was
no
use
and
sent
me
back
to
earth
i
could
figure
out
he
could
have
made
all
sorts
of
reasonable
excuses
for
my
not
continuing
in
my
search
for
the
missing
boys
and
i
have
swallowed
any
one
of
them
instead
he
locks
me
up
throws
away
the
key
and
turns
off
the
air
supply
what
did
i
know
that
i
could
communicate
to
people
back
on
earth
what
knowledge
did
i
have
that
was
a
menace
of
some
sort
to
security
or
to
be
more
near
the
truth
to
baxter
the
only
interesting
fact
i
stumbled
on
was
but
maybe
that
was
it
the
fact
that
the
sugarfeet
were
something
other
than
what
earth
had
claimed
that
one
i
met
was
certainly
no
dumb
animal
he
had
a
language
i
heard
that
bartender
talking
to
him
that
put
him
a
few
steps
ahead
of
cats
and
dogs
maybe
a
lot
further
but
what
difference
did
it
make
if
the
sugarfeet
were
or
dumb
animals
i
did
care
one
way
or
the
other
and
i
was
pretty
representative
of
an
earthman
was
i
who
care
anyhow
if
it
turned
out
the
sugarfeet
were
nearer
human
than
had
been
supposed
well
i
knew
the
who
if
not
the
why
baxter
obviously
cared
tremendously
which
deduction
left
me
approximately
nowhere
the
air
seemed
to
be
getting
staler
by
the
minute
i
found
i
could
breathe
better
lying
flat
on
my
back
not
even
using
enough
energy
to
remain
in
a
sitting
position
my
skin
was
clammy
with
sweat
from
head
to
foot
my
windpipe
felt
like
someone
had
just
given
it
a
brisk
toweling
with
a
hot
doormat
i
thought
desperately
of
pounding
on
that
impervious
stone
door
in
the
chance
that
my
suffocation
was
an
on
their
part
but
i
knew
in
my
heart
it
was
i
held
myself
on
the
cot
fighting
that
deadly
tug
of
irrational
emotion
if
i
was
going
to
suffocate
i
wanted
to
do
it
with
as
little
pain
as
possible
my
lungs
though
were
telling
me
a
different
story
they
had
that
time
to
go
up
for
air
feeling
the
hideous
hot
wave
that
floods
through
the
ribs
begging
and
then
ordering
the
swimmer
to
head
to
the
surface
before
his
lungs
rip
apart
i
fought
the
feeling
breathing
faster
to
keep
that
dull
nudging
from
becoming
a
command
but
it
was
harder
and
harder
not
to
fling
myself
at
that
bare
store
and
try
in
the
last
few
minutes
of
life
to
dig
my
way
free
with
my
fingertips
and
then
with
my
eyes
burning
in
my
own
perspiration
and
tongue
between
gaping
lips
i
felt
that
stinging
prickling
sensation
along
my
limbs
then
a
blinding
blaze
of
sparks
showered
me
and
i
jumped
to
my
feet
in
fright
the
wall
opposite
the
cell
door
was
raggedly
missing
its
slabs
of
granite
jutting
wildly
into
the
area
where
their
companions
had
just
been
and
there
was
air
cold
chilling
air
terribly
thin
to
breathe
but
it
was
air
and
i
leaped
through
that
gap
like
a
madman
flooding
my
hot
lungs
with
the
elusive
draughts
of
black
martian
night
i
staggered
dizzy
at
the
sparseness
of
the
atmosphere
and
then
a
tight
clamp
closed
upon
my
arm
and
kept
me
from
falling
a
clamp
i
looked
into
the
glittering
face
of
the
sugarfoot
it
had
the
collapser
in
its
free
hand
and
its
eyes
were
locked
on
mine
it
was
waiting
for
me
to
say
something
brother
i
said
managing
a
grin
i
would
love
coming
with
you
no
matter
where
surprisingly
it
shook
its
dragon
head
and
made
gestures
toward
my
blouse
then
an
upward
movement
of
its
arms
you
want
me
to
take
it
off
i
said
in
bewilderment
but
i
half
frozen
already
the
sugarfoot
was
adamant
again
it
pointed
to
the
blouse
and
did
that
motion
i
gave
up
fighting
it
the
creature
was
obviously
not
inimical
to
me
even
if
it
were
i
thought
i
owed
it
something
for
pulling
me
out
of
that
stone
coffin
hoping
pneumonia
was
less
painful
than
outright
suffocation
i
obediently
tugged
it
loose
from
within
my
belt
and
slid
the
thing
over
my
head
and
off
the
sugarfoot
took
it
from
me
turned
it
and
held
it
out
close
to
my
face
for
inspection
in
the
dim
lighting
of
tiny
phobos
and
barely
larger
deimos
as
they
scurried
across
the
cold
black
sky
i
stared
stupidly
at
the
inside
surface
of
the
blouse
the
black
one
which
baxter
had
insisted
i
wear
and
then
i
caught
the
glint
of
reflected
moonlight
where
there
should
have
been
plain
shirt
material
tiny
metallic
filaments
had
been
woven
into
the
garment
too
light
and
flexible
for
the
wearer
to
feel
them
but
strong
enough
not
to
break
with
constant
flexing
i
nodded
and
handed
the
blouse
back
to
the
sugarfoot
i
see
them
wires
i
said
but
what
does
it
mean
the
sugarfoot
pointed
toward
the
security
prison
which
at
this
point
of
the
topography
was
on
the
outside
of
the
hills
which
surrounded
marsport
security
had
burrowed
into
those
hills
to
make
themselves
an
dungeon
even
though
i
was
out
of
it
i
had
yet
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
escaped
it
was
easily
twenty
below
zero
and
the
air
was
thin
as
the
inside
of
a
vacuum
tube
i
was
dizzy
and
sick
and
barely
able
to
keep
from
falling
but
i
made
myself
ask
what
the
blouse
got
to
do
with
the
prison
the
sugarfoot
pointed
to
the
prison
the
blouse
and
made
a
circular
gesture
with
his
finger
the
prison
i
said
slowly
it
it
tracks
the
shirt
around
a
nod
then
the
sugarfoot
turned
its
head
and
extending
that
hollow
tongue
produced
a
shrill
piercing
whistle
through
the
vibrating
tip
i
heard
a
scrunching
sound
on
the
rocky
hillside
where
we
stood
and
then
the
damnedest
little
beast
hove
into
view
it
was
about
the
size
of
a
burro
but
it
had
six
legs
no
visible
head
or
neck
and
was
covered
with
spiky
hairs
that
seemed
more
like
lengths
of
straw
than
anything
else
i
could
think
of
this
ambulant
bale
of
hay
approached
us
and
halted
before
the
sugarfoot
the
sugarfoot
whistled
again
and
from
somewhere
in
the
front
i
assume
it
was
the
front
of
this
creature
a
tentacle
wormed
out
through
the
hay
and
took
the
blouse
from
the
sugarfoot
hand
a
third
and
final
whistle
and
the
thing
clutching
the
blouse
went
off
down
the
hillside
with
remarkable
speed
heading
toward
the
open
desert
that
lay
sullenly
gray
beneath
the
moonlight
it
had
that
to
it
the
front
and
rear
legs
on
one
side
moving
forward
simultaneously
with
the
middle
leg
on
the
opposite
side
then
a
swift
jerky
reverse
and
the
other
trio
of
legs
moved
forward
giving
it
a
strangely
graceful
awkward
wriggling
gait
but
it
was
fast
damned
fast
within
a
minute
it
was
out
of
sight
i
swayed
woozily
and
hung
onto
the
sugarfoot
shoulder
for
support
blazing
a
false
trail
huh
it
did
answer
but
reached
out
for
me
and
swung
me
up
into
its
powerful
arms
as
a
man
carries
a
child
it
clacked
something
which
i
took
to
be
a
term
of
reassurance
and
then
holding
me
tightly
so
i
would
get
jounced
to
death
it
took
off
in
a
leaping
bound
in
a
direction
at
right
angles
to
that
taken
by
the
creature
it
jolted
me
a
little
but
the
cold
and
lack
of
enough
oxygen
had
taken
its
toll
of
my
stamina
i
passed
out
before
the
third
bound
and
when
i
awoke
there
was
warmth
and
air
and
a
comfortable
bed
beneath
me
and
i
was
looking
into
the
face
of
snow
white
i
forgot
i
was
supposed
to
be
mad
at
her
instead
of
chewing
her
out
for
her
i
grasped
her
soft
little
hands
and
murmured
are
you
okay
miraculously
she
said
i
had
got
twenty
yards
into
town
before
my
face
and
name
were
being
blazoned
on
every
stereo
in
marsport
things
were
a
bit
rough
for
a
while
i
propped
myself
up
on
my
elbows
the
better
to
see
that
lovely
face
framed
in
a
halo
of
silky
pale
yellow
hair
and
said
what
happened
how
you
escape
what
with
these
mobs
and
sugarfeet
and
and
where
are
we
for
pete
sake
whoa
boy
she
laughed
pressing
me
back
onto
the
bed
her
hands
lingering
on
my
chest
for
a
delicious
moment
before
she
sat
back
again
you
been
very
sick
whether
you
know
it
or
not
here
take
a
look
she
picked
up
her
handbag
from
the
floor
took
out
a
small
mirror
and
held
it
in
front
of
my
face
i
took
one
look
then
shut
my
eyes
my
face
was
the
cheery
color
of
porcelain
with
purplish
eyelids
and
gray
lips
what
hit
me
i
sighed
opening
my
eyes
again
exposure
and
near
pneumonia
i
thought
you
were
dead
when
clatclit
carried
you
in
here
you
been
sleeping
for
nearly
hours
clatclit
i
said
is
that
the
ambient
hunk
of
dextrose
who
blasted
me
out
of
stir
let
not
be
colorful
said
snow
deprecatingly
you
owe
your
life
to
him
you
know
i
know
i
said
that
was
the
ad
man
in
me
coming
through
but
look
my
mind
a
whirlpool
of
confusion
could
you
please
tell
me
been
going
on
here
anyhow
lie
back
and
rest
said
snow
and
i
will
i
burrowed
deeper
into
the
warm
coverlet
sighed
and
kept
my
eyes
on
her
lovely
face
in
the
midst
of
her
discourse
i
even
sneaked
a
hand
out
and
laid
it
gently
over
her
own
it
was
smartly
slapped
without
rancor
and
i
withdrew
it
from
active
duty
for
a
while
well
first
thing
i
like
to
apologize
for
that
dirty
trick
i
pulled
back
on
the
snow
said
my
heart
turned
over
and
i
felt
an
idiot
grin
of
forgiveness
spreading
across
my
ghastly
features
i
found
it
quite
impossible
to
stay
angry
with
the
girl
as
i
said
something
happens
to
my
brain
when
around
women
accepted
i
croaked
i
knew
that
you
have
no
trouble
getting
away
from
those
security
men
i
sent
she
said
smilingly
then
why
did
you
send
them
i
asked
to
keep
them
from
asking
me
any
questions
she
said
with
a
small
shrug
for
all
i
knew
they
were
expecting
a
man
with
the
amnesty
however
knowing
that
just
having
it
carried
a
lot
of
weight
i
gave
them
the
order
to
pick
you
up
as
soon
as
they
approached
me
at
the
customs
booth
and
if
they
had
believed
me
i
complained
well
she
said
carefully
i
suppose
i
have
sent
them
a
note
or
something
telling
them
to
release
you
thanks
for
the
kind
thought
i
muttered
snow
ignored
my
minor
irritation
and
went
blithely
on
my
next
move
was
to
go
to
the
port
authority
and
find
out
just
where
the
was
berthed
before
takeoff
i
thought
that
ted
might
have
left
me
a
clue
of
some
sort
you
sound
as
if
he
were
expecting
you
to
traipse
up
here
after
him
i
said
dubiously
he
would
count
on
my
coming
if
that
what
you
mean
but
ted
a
good
kid
i
practically
had
to
raise
him
myself
he
knew
i
worry
if
i
did
hear
from
him
he
could
know
of
course
that
is
would
send
forged
letters
to
the
relatives
of
the
missing
boys
so
i
assumed
that
if
he
had
the
chance
he
leave
a
clue
of
some
kind
for
me
in
case
i
did
come
an
assurance
of
sorts
you
mean
something
like
that
like
okay
snow
so
do
worry
or
some
such
message
so
that
what
i
looked
for
at
the
rocket
berth
just
a
minute
i
interrupted
i
used
to
be
a
boy
once
myself
and
while
i
did
have
any
sisters
of
my
own
i
knew
a
lot
of
buddies
who
did
the
last
thing
in
the
world
they
expect
would
be
for
their
sister
to
follow
them
into
danger
hell
they
feel
like
sissies
if
they
had
to
count
on
a
sister
for
aid
i
snow
hesitated
i
not
what
you
call
the
typical
sister
jery
oh
she
blushed
prettily
when
you
have
to
raise
a
brother
you
have
to
learn
a
lot
of
things
if
you
going
to
bring
him
up
fairly
normally
i
had
to
teach
him
to
play
ball
to
box
to
ski
to
well
i
was
more
like
a
father
to
him
than
anything
so
ted
knowing
my
more
belligerent
side
would
just
about
figure
i
come
storming
up
here
to
find
him
i
do
know
i
pondered
aloud
if
you
and
ted
have
this
friendly
relationship
why
the
hell
would
he
put
you
to
all
this
trouble
it
seems
like
a
lousy
thing
on
his
part
to
go
wandering
off
without
a
word
it
would
be
snow
agreed
unless
there
was
a
mighty
important
reason
for
his
going
and
it
was
without
a
word
then
you
did
find
a
message
i
exclaimed
she
nodded
after
a
few
minutes
inspection
of
the
berth
i
found
it
scratched
onto
one
of
the
supporting
beams
funny
is
did
spot
it
i
remarked
it
in
our
special
silly
snow
said
to
anyone
else
look
like
hen
scratches
just
what
is
this
code
of
yours
i
asked
curious
snow
looked
at
me
a
moment
frowning
i
carry
the
secret
to
my
grave
i
said
generously
she
laughed
then
and
said
all
right
jery
just
a
second
from
her
handbag
she
took
out
a
small
address
book
and
a
pencil
found
a
blank
sheet
at
the
back
and
drew
the
following
diagrams
a
d
g
b
e
h
c
f
i
j
m
p
q
l
o
r
s
v
u
w
y
see
she
said
it
very
simple
really
you
just
remember
the
position
of
each
letter
in
its
portion
of
the
diagram
and
draw
the
corresponding
shape
instead
of
the
letter
a
square
for
e
for
n
an
for
g
same
with
a
dot
for
p
an
inverted
for
u
i
get
it
i
said
gad
it
looks
positively
runic
when
you
write
that
way
snow
put
the
address
book
back
into
her
bag
so
that
what
i
found
scratched
onto
that
supporting
beam
the
message
said
simply
snow
i
am
all
right
find
clatclit
the
sugarfoot
and
he
will
explain
i
stared
at
her
not
a
very
easy
task
he
set
was
it
nothing
easier
as
it
turned
out
she
said
airily
of
course
she
admitted
when
i
gave
her
a
cold
stare
i
did
know
it
was
easy
at
the
time
i
was
actually
pretty
much
bewildered
i
mean
i
thought
like
everybody
else
that
sugarfeet
were
like
cats
or
dogs
so
how
you
accomplish
locating
him
i
said
she
grinned
i
went
into
marsport
went
up
to
the
first
one
i
saw
they
as
common
as
pigeons
around
the
town
and
said
feeling
like
a
damned
fool
instead
of
the
stare
of
uncomprehending
nonintelligence
which
i
expected
for
my
efforts
the
thing
looked
to
left
and
right
i
guess
to
insure
that
no
earthmen
were
watching
then
beckoned
to
me
and
started
waddling
off
still
feeling
like
an
idiot
i
followed
it
it
led
me
back
toward
the
airstrip
for
a
while
i
had
the
stupid
impression
that
it
was
going
to
point
me
out
the
spot
from
which
the
boys
had
vanished
and
that
i
be
right
back
where
i
started
so
what
happened
i
demanded
impatiently
back
of
the
berth
where
the
had
been
there
was
a
slope
the
beginning
of
the
hills
that
surround
marsport
i
followed
the
sugarfoot
partway
up
the
slope
to
a
sort
of
cave
mouth
and
it
gestured
that
i
should
go
inside
okay
okay
i
prodded
you
went
inside
and
snow
shook
her
head
no
i
did
if
were
on
a
strange
planet
would
you
go
into
a
cave
after
a
creature
that
looked
like
a
dragon
she
added
besides
there
was
a
sign
in
front
of
the
cave
mouth
telling
earth
people
that
it
was
forbidden
to
enter
any
of
the
many
martian
caves
that
lay
on
the
hillsides
it
seems
they
old
volcanic
tunnels
and
wind
like
labyrinths
into
the
planet
some
of
the
earlier
colonists
vanished
there
you
know
ye
gods
i
growled
what
did
you
do
then
leave
the
sugarfoot
standing
at
the
cave
mouth
like
an
untipped
bellboy
more
or
less
she
admitted
it
seemed
to
want
to
take
me
with
it
but
i
begged
off
as
politely
as
possible
and
went
back
into
town
only
when
i
got
there
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
my
own
picture
on
the
stereo
screen
outside
the
public
auditorium
with
commands
ringing
into
the
street
i
nodded
i
suppose
you
swooned
away
on
the
pavement
snow
gave
me
a
black
look
mister
delvin
i
do
not
swoon
i
shrugged
just
as
well
marsport
has
no
pavement
anyhow
ho
ho
she
said
do
you
want
to
hear
the
rest
of
this
or
not
sorry
i
said
go
on
well
there
did
seem
to
be
anything
else
to
do
then
but
to
get
out
of
town
fast
i
had
been
spotted
yet
i
guess
my
picture
had
only
just
gotten
onto
the
screen
so
i
hurried
back
to
where
that
cave
mouth
was
and
the
sugarfoot
was
still
there
waiting
for
me
he
does
sound
like
an
untipped
bellboy
at
that
i
remarked
snow
ignored
this
and
continued
well
i
went
into
the
cave
with
him
after
all
getting
eaten
by
a
dragon
has
no
worse
end
result
than
getting
hit
with
a
the
process
is
a
bit
more
painful
though
i
said
i
took
that
chance
snow
said
i
had
to
so
i
followed
it
for
what
seemed
miles
of
slippery
tubular
tunnels
knowing
and
it
scared
me
stiff
that
i
never
find
my
way
out
without
a
map
and
it
led
me
here
where
i
met
clatclit
and
where
by
the
way
i
said
are
we
darned
if
i
know
said
snow
we
at
present
in
a
room
off
one
of
those
tunnels
i
mentioned
the
sugarfeet
have
been
wonderful
helping
you
especially
in
bringing
water
for
you
they
deathly
scared
of
the
stuff
i
would
be
too
in
their
case
i
said
it
be
like
toting
around
a
carboy
of
sulphuric
acid
well
anyhow
you
alive
she
said
and
that
something
but
as
for
ted
her
voice
faltered
i
looked
up
startled
he
not
dead
d
oh
no
at
least
i
hope
not
she
said
i
only
meant
that
while
i
located
clatclit
i
ca
figure
out
either
his
gestures
or
his
pardon
the
expression
words
he
understands
english
even
if
his
vocal
apparatus
ca
form
it
i
said
why
do
you
just
ask
him
questions
he
nods
easily
enough
i
did
that
she
sighed
i
asked
if
ted
were
alive
and
he
nodded
then
i
asked
to
be
brought
to
him
and
he
spread
his
hands
i
said
that
mean
you
do
know
where
ted
is
he
seemed
stymied
he
nodded
then
shook
his
head
immediately
you
figure
that
one
out
i
tried
hard
nothing
happened
inside
my
head
it
was
filled
with
the
picture
of
snow
her
lips
slightly
parted
her
violet
eyes
anxious
her
hair
like
a
misty
golden
corolla
i
ca
not
with
you
around
remember
i
said
helplessly
she
stood
up
from
my
bedside
then
close
your
eyes
or
something
jery
i
stand
here
quiet
as
a
mouse
well
i
said
doubtfully
i
try
i
shut
my
eyes
and
tried
to
convince
myself
that
snow
was
anywhere
about
i
could
do
it
no
use
i
sighed
opening
my
eyes
again
i
can
feel
you
here
i
guess
the
only
thing
to
do
is
send
clatclit
in
to
see
you
and
stay
outside
myself
she
said
good
idea
i
said
send
him
around
with
a
lunch
though
will
you
i
gone
all
hollow
inside
snow
smiled
and
left
through
a
rocky
archway
i
lay
there
looking
about
me
with
snow
in
the
room
i
had
paid
attention
to
my
less
stimulating
environment
now
i
found
myself
gazing
over
dark
crimson
walls
smooth
and
glossy
looking
the
room
was
just
a
bubble
in
the
rock
about
ten
feet
in
diameter
with
an
artificially
leveled
floor
light
came
from
a
narrow
ridge
that
ran
around
the
walls
near
the
top
a
sort
of
ledge
covered
with
fuzzy
stuff
that
glowed
pallidly
white
i
threw
back
the
coverlet
and
eased
myself
to
my
feet
and
was
grateful
to
find
my
trousers
folded
neatly
upon
a
small
hump
of
rock
that
probably
served
a
sugarfoot
as
a
stool
i
slipped
them
on
hurriedly
then
investigated
the
stuff
on
that
ledge
it
seemed
to
be
a
kind
of
crumbly
dry
fungus
not
unlike
the
stuff
found
in
dead
logs
on
earth
the
phosphorescent
foxfire
but
it
was
a
lot
brighter
and
also
gave
off
a
detectable
amount
of
heat
too
which
explained
why
i
was
still
turning
blue
i
left
off
looking
at
the
heaps
of
fungi
and
went
to
the
archway
for
a
look
beyond
the
room
the
cave
dissolved
into
a
riot
of
diverging
tunnels
i
decided
to
stay
put
rather
than
risk
getting
myself
entombed
in
some
pahoehoeal
cavity
and
succumbing
to
the
fate
baxter
had
planned
for
me
and
besides
those
tunnels
were
black
as
oil
further
off
from
the
chamber
i
was
in
my
feet
might
find
me
a
quick
shortcut
to
the
center
of
the
planet
in
that
treacherous
gloom
sugarfeet
i
decided
could
either
see
in
the
dark
or
else
they
carried
a
handful
of
that
fungus
with
them
when
they
went
for
a
stroll
i
went
back
to
the
cot
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
clatclit
appearance
passing
the
time
by
struggling
back
into
my
durex
boots
i
felt
a
bit
more
competent
once
trousered
and
shod
than
i
had
felt
while
lying
beneath
that
coverlet
in
my
shorts
a
man
without
his
pants
is
only
half
a
man
somehow
from
the
corridor
there
came
a
series
of
sharp
regular
clicks
and
then
clatclit
waddled
in
when
not
going
full
speed
in
that
bound
of
theirs
the
sugarfeet
moved
rather
clumsily
like
an
old
sailor
rocking
down
the
street
on
legs
trained
to
fight
a
rolling
deck
i
think
it
was
the
tail
weight
that
accounted
for
that
lumbering
gait
it
was
fully
as
long
as
the
legs
and
nearly
as
thick
except
where
it
dwindled
at
the
end
to
a
solitary
prismatic
red
spike
i
rather
judged
that
that
crystalline
dagger
came
in
handy
during
a
fight
clatclit
made
a
gesture
with
both
hands
and
clacked
something
at
me
his
attitude
and
inflection
were
unmistakeable
i
gave
him
the
earth
equivalent
of
the
gesture
raising
my
right
hand
in
a
sort
of
lazy
wave
hello
yourself
i
said
snow
seems
to
be
having
trouble
communicating
with
you
clatclit
nodded
and
seated
himself
on
that
stool
what
this
about
her
brother
ted
i
went
on
she
asked
if
you
knew
where
he
was
and
got
a
answer
the
nod
again
do
you
know
where
he
at
i
persisted
clatclit
made
the
same
motion
with
his
nubbly
head
that
snow
had
described
i
thought
it
over
you
know
a
where
he
is
but
not
violent
nods
three
of
them
ah
so
that
it
i
said
let
see
can
you
take
us
to
him
the
business
again
you
can
take
us
to
a
point
but
no
further
maybe
the
violent
triple
nod
is
there
danger
three
nods
to
you
headshake
to
me
and
snow
then
headshake
ah
to
nods
how
about
his
companions
are
they
in
danger
too
yes
from
whom
i
said
forgetting
our
limitations
disgusted
stare
oh
yeah
that
right
uh
from
baxter
a
rocking
of
the
head
from
side
to
side
this
was
a
new
one
i
wrinkled
up
my
forehead
puzzling
it
out
baxter
a
danger
in
general
you
mean
but
that
not
the
danger
you
meant
right
nods
again
okay
then
let
see
who
left
danger
from
earthmen
like
those
mobs
who
came
after
me
negative
surely
not
danger
from
me
or
snow
negative
from
from
you
martians
i
choked
bewildered
the
head
rocked
from
side
to
side
danger
danger
from
sugarfeet
a
very
violent
negative
but
from
i
queried
blinking
a
slow
positive
nod
but
there
are
no
martians
but
you
sugarfeet
unless
an
icy
cold
hand
grabbed
my
adrenal
glands
and
squeezed
hard
the
ancients
i
gasped
in
horror
a
triple
yes
then
they
not
extinct
a
disgusted
stare
i
realized
he
could
answer
till
i
rephrased
that
one
or
i
be
stuck
with
wondering
if
he
meant
yes
they
are
or
yes
they
are
are
they
extinct
i
said
headshake
and
they
got
the
boys
nod
and
they
inimical
to
man
in
some
way
violent
negative
i
stared
confused
into
clatclit
lizardy
eyes
they
they
are
dangerous
to
man
the
sideways
rocking
motion
they
a
danger
to
some
men
baxter
men
a
nod
but
with
a
kind
of
hesitation
about
it
but
also
to
the
boys
i
marvelled
the
motion
under
certain
conditions
they
a
danger
to
the
boys
yes
these
conditions
do
they
have
anything
to
do
with
baxter
yes
hmmm
i
leaned
back
on
my
hands
on
the
cot
and
studied
face
thinking
hard
could
it
be
that
these
ancients
want
something
with
regard
to
baxter
but
that
the
boys
safety
is
the
price
of
it
a
jump
up
from
the
stool
a
laughably
earthlike
clap
of
the
hands
and
a
triple
series
of
very
positive
nods
clatclit
sat
down
again
a
much
happier
sugarfoot
than
when
he
entered
but
i
protested
baxter
from
my
last
contact
with
him
is
the
sort
who
care
about
the
boys
right
nods
well
then
for
pete
sake
i
protested
loudly
over
whose
heads
are
the
ancients
holding
the
safety
of
the
boys
clatclit
extended
a
ruddy
talon
directly
at
me
and
then
aimed
it
toward
the
corridor
outside
me
and
snow
i
cried
standing
up
they
trying
to
force
me
and
snow
to
do
something
for
them
and
making
the
boys
safety
the
price
of
it
why
that
that
criminal
in
my
rage
i
taken
a
step
toward
clatclit
not
even
thinking
of
the
fact
that
his
crystalline
constitution
would
be
an
easy
match
for
my
fists
genially
though
clatclit
leaned
back
on
the
stool
widened
his
already
wide
eyes
and
pointing
two
index
fingers
at
his
chest
shook
his
head
from
side
to
side
what
i
said
not
getting
it
then
oh
i
see
it
not
your
fault
what
the
ancients
have
done
yeah
you
right
sorry
clatclit
he
shrugged
off
the
apology
and
waited
for
more
of
my
investigative
monologue
i
dropped
back
to
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
cot
and
let
him
wait
a
while
while
i
tried
to
figure
the
whole
mess
out
then
i
remembered
something
and
looked
up
at
him
clatclit
back
in
marsport
when
i
first
met
you
i
asked
why
i
had
been
chosen
and
you
indicated
that
you
tell
me
later
why
was
i
chosen
clatclit
just
stared
uncertainly
you
know
what
i
mean
why
was
i
the
one
you
did
blast
with
that
collapser
and
why
you
go
off
without
me
the
first
time
but
want
to
take
me
along
the
second
a
very
disgusted
stare
i
slowed
down
and
fed
him
questions
one
at
a
time
back
at
that
bar
you
blasted
the
other
men
then
left
without
me
why
clatclit
pointed
to
himself
then
to
his
cranium
then
to
me
then
made
a
gesture
you
thought
i
negation
you
thought
i
been
blasted
too
except
that
i
flattened
out
behind
that
wall
and
you
could
see
me
behind
the
remaining
bottom
section
you
originally
meant
to
get
me
out
of
there
alive
nods
vigorous
and
you
thought
you
goofed
with
the
collapser
and
gotten
me
too
nods
so
what
happened
in
the
street
how
you
happen
to
stick
around
the
talon
went
to
his
earhole
then
he
spread
his
hands
wide
in
a
gesture
of
and
waited
hopefully
you
heard
a
lot
of
what
oh
you
heard
those
men
coming
up
the
street
and
stuck
around
to
see
what
was
up
but
i
did
hear
them
and
i
was
closer
in
fact
they
were
sneaking
after
me
clatclit
pointed
to
his
ears
and
nodded
then
indicated
mine
and
shook
his
head
i
got
it
then
supersensitivity
it
made
sense
just
as
man
ears
accustomed
to
use
in
air
are
even
more
receptive
to
sounds
in
a
denser
medium
as
for
instance
underwater
where
sound
waves
are
more
powerful
so
the
sugarfeet
ears
built
for
use
in
the
rarefied
martian
atmosphere
could
hear
all
the
better
in
the
heavier
air
of
marsport
okay
so
you
heard
them
saw
me
and
came
to
the
rescue
fine
now
the
big
question
why
what
is
so
special
about
me
clatclit
he
stood
up
and
made
the
same
strange
gesture
he
made
the
night
on
von
braun
street
alternate
pointing
to
his
head
then
to
me
the
me
part
was
easy
enough
but
the
other
i
tried
a
series
of
likely
meanings
that
motion
to
your
head
clatclit
you
mean
i
the
head
of
something
the
investigation
for
instance
negative
i
intelligent
a
pause
then
the
motion
you
mean
i
am
but
that
the
wrong
answer
hmmm
very
tactful
of
you
clatclit
you
could
have
given
me
a
no
on
that
one
clatclit
showed
a
friendly
array
of
teeth
i
interpreted
this
as
an
evidence
of
camaraderie
so
i
just
grinned
back
okay
clatclit
let
see
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
brain
power
a
wild
light
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
seemed
ready
to
crack
out
of
his
glittering
pelt
so
agitated
did
he
become
apparently
i
hit
on
something
but
he
did
know
what
sort
of
signal
to
make
i
getting
warm
i
said
clatclit
stared
and
i
realized
that
even
knowing
and
understanding
colloquial
english
he
might
still
have
missed
a
few
of
the
slangier
expressions
that
is
i
said
i
close
to
the
answer
nod
something
to
do
with
brain
power
vigorous
nod
mine
negative
baxter
negative
anyone
i
got
the
and
a
climactic
shrug
clatclit
was
apparently
stuck
for
a
response
i
tried
to
figure
it
out
brain
power
but
not
mine
not
really
anyone
and
yet
in
a
way
someone
then
i
jumped
up
and
faced
him
elated
the
brain
the
composite
brain
of
international
cybernetics
clatclit
emitted
something
that
sounded
very
much
like
a
sigh
of
relief
and
nodded
i
thought
back
to
his
gesture
then
you
mean
i
was
rescued
because
i
was
the
man
chosen
by
the
brain
three
brisk
nods
now
i
was
really
confused
i
shook
my
head
at
clatclit
and
said
i
give
up
friend
i
out
of
questions
you
can
answer
he
gave
me
a
curious
look
an
expectant
look
the
only
question
i
can
think
of
is
should
mars
be
interested
in
me
just
because
i
was
selected
by
the
brain
back
on
earth
and
a
tough
one
to
do
in
pantomime
clatclit
rose
up
proudly
on
tiptoe
as
if
stubbornly
denying
the
slur
i
cast
on
his
miming
abilities
he
looked
hurt
and
i
felt
like
a
crumb
okay
friend
try
but
i
do
guarantee
i
get
it
clatclit
stood
a
moment
in
thought
then
pointed
upward
up
out
above
i
said
all
received
negatives
it
no
use
clatclit
i
ca
oh
all
right
once
more
uh
away
up
nod
earth
i
said
excitedly
nod
well
what
about
it
i
said
clatclit
pointed
up
to
earth
then
to
me
and
shook
his
head
then
he
pointed
down
to
mars
i
guessed
by
association
and
to
me
again
this
time
he
nodded
i
said
mechanically
talon
to
head
brain
i
choked
out
the
brain
did
not
select
me
motion
not
exactly
well
then
no
that
crazy
clatclit
looked
a
question
i
laughed
wearily
and
sank
back
onto
the
cot
all
i
get
chum
is
the
ridiculous
impression
that
mars
was
behind
the
brain
selecting
me
back
on
earth
i
sat
bolt
upright
slightly
stunned
clatclit
was
nodding
an
hour
later
when
clatclit
had
gone
off
to
do
whatever
it
is
that
sugarfeet
do
when
they
not
playing
charades
with
earthmen
i
joined
snow
in
a
luncheon
she
been
able
to
put
together
with
the
help
of
a
few
of
our
dragonish
friends
it
seemed
to
be
mostly
a
species
of
watery
plus
a
smattering
of
rubbery
white
cubes
that
tried
hard
to
taste
like
mushrooms
but
failed
i
was
trying
to
be
light
and
casual
we
may
be
poisoned
you
know
i
remarked
chewing
valiantly
on
a
mouthful
of
the
stuff
it
quicker
than
starving
she
observed
continuing
to
eat
if
we
do
eat
we
sure
to
die
but
yeah
yeah
i
know
if
we
do
we
got
a
chance
of
survival
too
bad
you
do
carry
sandwiches
in
that
handbag
of
yours
i
do
she
said
calmly
but
they
all
enjoyably
gone
thank
you
i
could
wait
forever
for
you
to
come
out
of
your
coma
thanks
loads
i
muttered
chomping
doggedly
on
a
stubborn
white
cube
and
wishing
i
did
have
to
tell
her
what
i
knew
so
tell
me
more
about
what
clatclit
said
she
urged
washing
down
her
alien
meal
with
a
cupped
rock
filled
with
clear
but
alkaline
water
i
shrugged
and
let
the
rest
of
the
vegetation
sit
where
it
was
until
i
grew
a
lot
hungrier
it
was
safe
from
my
alimentary
system
for
a
spell
as
i
see
it
baxter
is
a
menace
to
the
ancients
they
as
a
gesture
decided
to
get
an
earthman
up
here
who
could
find
the
fact
of
their
existence
and
make
it
known
to
earth
then
a
meeting
between
earth
and
mars
can
be
arranged
and
we
can
come
to
some
sort
of
peaceful
right
now
baxter
in
the
dastardly
position
of
being
able
to
destroy
the
ancients
with
no
one
back
home
even
knowing
there
was
anyone
to
destroy
see
all
but
how
they
got
hold
of
you
they
exerted
some
kind
of
influence
heaven
only
knows
what
kind
of
technology
they
possess
and
it
triggered
the
brain
back
on
earth
into
selecting
me
then
the
sugarfeet
who
are
by
the
way
not
servants
of
the
ancients
but
another
distinct
race
were
used
as
first
one
to
spot
me
got
the
ashtray
or
something
who
knows
but
anyhow
they
selected
me
and
jery
said
snow
crinkling
up
her
brow
how
did
they
know
that
you
even
existed
i
guess
i
could
have
put
that
more
clearly
they
did
know
there
was
a
a
jery
delvin
but
they
knew
what
qualifications
such
a
man
must
have
and
so
they
influenced
the
brain
to
choose
such
a
man
when
security
tried
to
find
a
solution
to
the
mystery
of
the
missing
scouts
who
are
missing
only
in
order
to
create
a
mystery
so
that
the
is
people
would
use
the
brain
to
select
the
man
whom
the
martians
had
gimmicked
the
brain
to
fake
snow
shook
her
head
and
shut
her
eyes
it
got
my
head
going
in
circles
jery
i
grinned
at
her
okay
we
take
it
from
the
top
baxter
for
reasons
yet
unknown
is
a
menace
to
the
ancients
in
a
manner
yet
unknown
also
their
plight
must
come
to
the
attention
of
the
peoples
of
earth
with
me
so
far
she
nodded
impatiently
okay
then
so
what
would
make
the
people
back
home
sit
up
and
take
notice
of
little
old
mars
well
how
about
swiping
the
space
scouts
it
a
great
plan
really
not
only
are
earthmen
suckers
for
a
child
in
trouble
but
these
particular
children
are
representatives
of
every
civilized
nation
on
our
planet
so
they
are
swiped
jery
snow
tried
to
interrupt
i
know
the
kids
left
of
their
own
free
will
i
get
to
that
in
a
minute
she
bit
her
lip
and
kept
still
and
i
went
on
baxter
sensing
the
hand
of
the
ancients
in
this
makes
a
good
countermove
he
keeps
the
earth
people
under
the
impression
that
all
is
well
with
the
kids
this
of
course
can
not
go
on
for
too
damned
long
he
got
to
find
those
kids
and
fast
so
unwittingly
following
the
plan
set
up
by
the
ancients
he
feeds
the
known
data
into
the
brain
however
they
geared
the
brain
to
react
to
that
particular
data
by
selecting
a
man
who
will
not
conform
to
baxter
standards
that
is
a
man
who
would
have
assisted
baxter
plan
but
one
who
will
be
able
to
size
up
the
situation
and
act
on
it
in
a
manner
beneficial
to
the
martians
how
can
you
be
so
sure
of
this
snow
demanded
i
not
for
pete
sake
i
snapped
remember
i
had
to
dredge
all
this
information
out
of
clatclit
by
tortuous
questioning
a
lot
of
it
i
had
to
conjecture
to
fill
the
gaps
but
hell
it
fits
does
it
i
sorry
snow
said
contritely
okay
okay
i
said
relenting
pardon
me
for
biting
your
head
off
where
was
i
acting
beneficial
to
the
ancient
martians
ummm
yeah
okay
so
i
picked
baxter
is
a
little
surprised
when
i
show
up
since
i
just
do
look
the
type
i
guess
but
he
has
to
follow
what
the
brain
selected
since
he
has
no
other
way
of
getting
to
those
missing
kids
still
with
me
okay
however
unknown
to
even
baxter
there
is
a
third
contingent
at
work
those
men
who
tried
to
kill
you
said
snow
right
these
are
the
characters
who
want
to
team
with
the
martians
against
earth
and
make
this
planet
the
ruling
one
in
the
solar
system
i
do
understand
their
motivation
at
all
it
well
it
a
little
like
the
feelings
of
the
early
colonists
in
new
england
toward
king
george
they
off
here
on
a
new
planet
but
they
still
paying
taxes
to
earth
and
at
any
rate
they
want
to
be
a
separate
country
not
all
the
feel
this
way
just
a
disgruntled
few
but
it
always
those
few
groaners
who
seem
to
run
things
because
the
other
people
in
their
neutral
way
do
take
any
action
against
them
hell
i
do
want
this
turning
into
a
lecture
on
political
science
let
me
go
on
when
the
news
hits
the
stereos
that
a
girl
with
a
forged
amnesty
is
on
the
loose
in
marsport
these
people
show
a
lot
of
sense
since
the
customs
office
would
let
you
off
earth
with
such
a
thing
and
the
customs
people
here
would
have
let
you
bring
one
onto
mars
they
know
it
must
be
the
real
mccoy
but
if
real
why
this
about
shooting
to
kill
obviously
you
taken
the
amnesty
from
the
real
person
who
should
have
it
now
they
do
know
me
from
adam
but
they
put
the
word
out
all
over
town
to
keep
watch
for
anyone
who
might
be
the
actual
i
qualify
how
snow
asked
narrowing
her
eyes
with
interest
first
i
a
stranger
secondly
though
not
in
a
security
uniform
i
toting
a
collapser
which
means
unless
i
have
the
approval
of
is
the
death
penalty
i
carried
it
openly
so
they
know
i
stolen
it
anyplace
okay
i
a
stranger
who
has
an
in
with
security
a
collapser
on
my
belt
and
the
word
is
out
that
an
minus
the
amnesty
is
in
town
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
a
and
i
walked
into
your
bar
i
slip
you
a
mickey
snow
said
sweetly
uh
yeah
okay
i
muttered
declining
an
urge
to
snarl
something
back
at
her
besides
she
had
a
cruel
blow
coming
but
why
did
they
want
you
snow
demanded
honey
i
said
before
i
could
catch
myself
but
she
had
flinched
so
i
decided
to
let
the
appelation
stand
they
do
know
the
scouts
are
missing
as
far
as
marsport
is
concerned
those
kids
took
off
in
the
see
so
what
do
you
suppose
they
decide
the
is
after
snow
eyes
widened
into
violet
pools
and
she
exclaimed
finally
getting
the
point
them
at
last
a
light
dawns
in
that
lovely
skull
i
sighed
they
figured
i
was
here
to
round
up
the
rebels
among
the
and
stash
them
in
that
lousy
prison
i
was
blasted
free
of
so
they
lock
me
in
that
cellar
and
have
a
meeting
to
decide
what
to
be
done
only
clatclit
knowing
i
the
guy
the
ancients
have
been
waiting
for
let
these
men
keep
me
so
he
goes
to
the
meeting
too
but
would
the
rebels
be
surprised
at
a
sugarfoot
dearest
girl
the
rebels
are
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
sugarfeet
are
more
than
just
dumb
animals
clatclit
tells
me
that
they
counting
on
the
sugarfeet
for
support
if
it
even
comes
to
open
battle
why
do
you
suppose
that
bartender
went
to
the
trouble
of
learning
that
clacketty
language
of
theirs
but
why
would
the
sugarfeet
join
with
them
snow
asked
are
they
friendly
on
the
neutral
side
i
said
not
in
the
way
you
mean
the
sugarfeet
from
planetary
sympathies
are
on
the
side
of
the
ancients
the
were
hence
so
plan
a
of
the
ancients
was
a
joining
of
forces
between
sugarfeet
and
rebel
it
was
a
slim
chance
but
they
needed
allies
clatclit
tells
me
that
this
thing
been
growing
for
nearly
a
year
now
but
a
few
weeks
ago
what
happens
up
to
mars
come
these
kids
who
are
not
only
good
emotional
contacts
with
earth
but
with
all
the
powerful
nations
the
ancients
immediately
scrap
the
first
scheme
and
switch
to
plan
b
the
one
currently
enmeshed
in
so
that
why
clatclit
was
dickering
for
the
collapser
at
that
meeting
you
eavesdropped
on
snow
exclaimed
sure
i
said
the
rebels
wanted
that
collapser
for
purposes
of
duplication
its
mechanism
is
one
of
security
secrets
only
now
the
ancients
do
want
to
help
the
rebel
cause
so
clatclit
was
instructed
to
get
that
thing
from
them
at
all
costs
he
did
you
know
the
cost
snow
shuddered
all
those
men
poof
just
like
that
honey
this
is
war
i
sighed
sadly
and
you
and
i
are
the
key
figures
in
it
whether
we
like
it
or
not
i
think
i
all
clear
except
on
the
one
point
why
did
the
boys
leave
the
willingly
male
children
especially
that
brother
of
yours
love
intrigue
and
adventure
and
secret
codes
clatclit
and
his
friends
knowing
they
pique
the
kids
curiosity
let
them
know
that
they
were
more
than
dumb
animals
this
being
in
direct
conflict
with
all
they
been
taught
back
on
earth
put
them
in
the
enviable
position
of
being
the
know
and
kids
are
quick
to
pick
up
new
tongues
too
i
have
no
doubts
that
within
three
hours
those
kids
knew
more
of
the
sugarfoot
language
than
i
learn
in
a
lifetime
here
they
were
told
was
their
chance
to
be
heroes
plan
b
was
told
to
them
and
the
part
they
must
play
in
it
what
kid
would
go
along
with
a
chance
to
take
part
in
a
adventure
and
so
after
leaving
the
evidence
that
apparently
vanished
in
space
clatclit
tells
me
this
was
one
of
the
boys
idea
nice
kids
we
grow
on
earth
leaving
this
baffling
trail
they
tramped
off
after
the
sugarfeet
into
the
cave
like
the
happy
youngsters
following
the
pied
piper
i
slowed
down
this
was
the
part
i
did
want
to
say
and
snow
said
sensing
my
distress
and
going
tense
and
they
wound
up
neatly
jailed
by
the
ancients
i
said
the
ancients
had
made
sure
to
select
a
man
me
that
could
be
coerced
by
threats
to
those
poor
kids
you
mean
if
you
do
do
what
they
want
snow
said
but
complete
the
sentence
the
kids
pay
i
finished
for
her
so
tell
me
lady
what
my
move
i
do
know
she
said
kind
of
startled
as
if
just
beginning
to
realize
the
desperation
of
our
situation
i
not
sure
who
right
or
wrong
in
this
jery
neither
am
i
i
said
bitterly
baxter
a
stinker
but
he
does
represent
earth
of
which
i
currently
in
favor
the
rebels
may
be
violent
but
they
have
a
few
points
in
their
favor
too
and
the
ancients
snow
looked
at
me
expectantly
the
ancients
them
i
hate
i
said
suddenly
i
do
like
their
loyalties
snow
they
were
the
friends
of
the
rebels
sure
until
they
thought
of
a
better
plan
then
the
rebels
were
calmly
forgotten
or
vaporized
when
necessary
right
now
they
on
my
side
what
with
ordering
my
escape
and
protecting
me
from
baxter
but
it
only
for
so
long
as
i
serve
their
ends
then
it
jery
delvin
then
snow
arose
a
slim
hand
going
to
her
throat
we
do
know
for
sure
if
the
boys
are
alive
i
shook
my
head
solemnly
we
do
know
it
at
all
clatclit
came
lumbering
into
the
chamber
and
paused
to
survey
the
remnants
of
our
meal
he
pointed
to
me
then
to
snow
then
made
the
outward
gesture
and
looked
questioningly
yeah
i
said
we
finished
clatclit
thanks
he
nodded
then
beckoned
to
me
and
pointed
toward
the
tunneled
gloom
beyond
the
archway
come
with
you
i
said
come
where
he
pointed
down
downstairs
i
asked
furious
glare
it
was
nearly
impossible
to
think
with
snow
sitting
right
there
across
from
me
but
luckily
my
memory
came
through
with
what
that
gesture
had
meant
the
last
time
he
used
it
mars
i
said
softly
motion
of
the
head
something
like
mars
the
ancients
brisk
nods
snow
got
to
her
feet
apprehensive
it
all
right
i
said
remember
so
far
they
want
me
alive
i
do
have
to
worry
unless
they
think
up
a
scheme
that
does
need
me
no
jery
i
coming
with
you
she
said
clutching
my
arm
those
smooth
little
fingers
bit
in
like
dull
teeth
she
must
have
been
better
at
sports
than
her
pupil
ted
snow
the
way
i
see
it
this
is
going
to
be
dangerous
her
fists
went
to
her
hips
and
by
what
omniscience
are
you
certain
that
i
be
safe
back
here
she
queried
she
had
me
there
the
sugarfeet
were
being
buddies
at
the
moment
however
a
quick
change
of
plan
and
snow
might
end
up
vaporized
gnawed
or
just
left
to
starve
in
this
devious
labyrinth
okay
come
along
i
sighed
but
hold
my
hand
i
wo
get
lost
she
protested
that
was
the
reason
honey
i
grinned
at
her
her
eyes
flashed
a
moment
and
her
nostrils
made
a
perfunctory
flare
then
she
smiled
surprisingly
shy
and
slipped
her
hand
into
mine
for
moral
support
she
said
nice
rationalizing
i
said
but
she
did
pull
away
together
we
followed
clatclit
out
of
the
chamber
and
that
when
i
learned
the
primary
function
of
that
red
spike
at
the
tip
of
the
tail
no
sooner
were
we
away
from
the
chamber
than
that
tiny
trylon
began
to
glow
first
pale
pink
then
a
brighter
scarlet
and
finally
a
brilliant
we
followed
that
bobbing
tailtip
like
the
through
the
bowels
of
hell
snow
grip
on
my
hand
grew
a
little
tighter
as
we
progressed
along
the
slippery
red
rock
of
the
nearly
circular
passage
a
regular
firefly
i
joked
to
lighten
her
mood
what
they
think
of
next
she
did
answer
bad
joke
i
asked
no
it
did
you
notice
jery
we
going
we
did
seem
to
be
descending
at
that
i
could
imagine
snow
mind
conjuring
up
tons
of
planet
pressing
down
on
us
without
warning
not
down
i
said
to
her
downer
if
it
sets
your
mind
at
rest
we
just
took
off
from
a
place
way
below
ground
if
the
roof
did
fall
in
there
it
probably
wo
up
ahead
how
do
you
know
that
she
asked
her
curiosity
taking
the
place
of
her
trepidation
which
was
what
i
hoped
for
the
air
i
said
we
were
breathing
in
that
chamber
remember
for
the
air
to
be
that
plentiful
we
just
had
to
be
far
under
the
ground
already
the
atmosphere
grows
denser
as
one
descends
you
know
like
on
the
canal
bottoms
i
never
been
on
a
canal
bottom
she
said
come
to
think
of
it
neither
have
i
i
must
have
read
that
someplace
we
followed
clatclit
and
his
magic
taillight
a
few
more
yards
then
snow
said
you
do
have
to
kid
around
to
buck
me
up
jery
oh
yes
i
do
i
disagreed
sincerely
for
some
reason
or
other
my
main
worry
at
the
moment
is
for
you
so
if
i
can
keep
you
happy
happy
see
she
said
softly
her
hand
pressed
mine
more
tightly
for
a
brief
moment
thanks
if
you
think
you
can
repay
my
efforts
with
a
mere
word
of
gratitude
i
said
in
a
villainous
whisper
you
have
lots
to
learn
about
men
poor
child
jery
do
joke
any
more
i
frightened
really
frightened
she
said
her
voice
trembling
okay
i
said
and
left
off
i
did
tell
her
but
my
own
pulsebeat
would
have
qualified
me
for
a
hero
medal
either
then
up
ahead
in
the
blackness
beyond
clatclit
glowing
tail
spike
i
heard
a
dull
roaring
a
few
hundred
yards
further
on
the
roar
was
louder
and
i
could
feel
it
through
the
soles
of
my
boots
what
is
it
jery
snow
whispered
it
sounds
like
water
i
said
like
more
water
than
i
thought
there
was
on
this
whole
spaceborne
death
valley
jery
snow
fingers
dug
into
my
palm
if
this
is
the
way
to
the
ancients
then
this
must
be
what
clatclit
meant
when
he
told
you
he
could
only
take
you
so
far
and
no
further
sure
it
is
i
exclaimed
excitedly
a
child
could
have
figured
it
out
what
else
but
water
could
impede
these
things
clatclit
was
slowing
his
pace
and
moving
more
carefully
then
not
ten
feet
in
front
of
him
the
fiery
glow
of
his
tail
tip
was
reflected
from
a
million
foaming
shifting
wet
surfaces
he
took
another
few
courageous
steps
then
halted
pressed
back
against
the
curve
of
the
tunnel
wall
he
averted
his
gaze
from
the
raging
torrent
beyond
him
but
his
outstretched
hand
still
pointed
in
that
direction
i
felt
a
cold
wet
spray
on
my
face
and
saw
with
a
little
shock
that
some
of
the
glittering
facets
of
clatclit
scaly
hide
were
already
becoming
pocked
and
eroded
we
have
to
go
fast
i
said
releasing
snow
hand
only
to
clutch
her
arm
tightly
against
my
side
if
we
take
too
long
our
luciferous
friend
here
will
be
a
sticky
red
puddle
and
i
do
intend
crossing
that
in
the
dark
was
a
jagged
ridge
of
rock
that
continued
forward
from
where
our
segment
of
tunnel
ended
scant
feet
beyond
clatclit
cowering
form
it
was
glistening
with
pools
of
black
water
and
wet
froth
flung
up
there
by
the
raging
river
that
passed
less
than
a
foot
beneath
its
slightly
arched
surface
the
torrent
rushed
angrily
from
somewhere
in
the
hollow
blackness
to
our
right
leaped
and
sprayed
past
the
natural
bridge
of
rock
barely
two
feet
wide
that
lay
before
our
feet
and
then
my
stomach
grew
sick
at
the
sight
just
to
the
left
of
the
bridge
the
vaulted
tunnel
which
contained
this
black
martian
river
dipped
and
dropped
the
river
just
beyond
our
frail
bridge
was
a
black
cataract
falling
into
the
heart
of
the
planet
jery
snow
said
shivering
hold
me
hold
me
tight
or
i
never
get
across
that
it
all
right
i
said
with
a
calm
tone
that
surprised
the
hell
out
of
me
here
i
got
directly
behind
her
and
ran
my
hands
along
the
undersides
of
her
forearms
gripping
them
tightly
midway
to
her
wrists
now
just
walk
as
i
direct
you
snow
close
your
eyes
if
you
want
i
wo
guide
you
wrong
i
trust
you
jery
she
said
softly
okay
then
honey
i
kept
my
voice
gentle
soothing
left
foot
forward
no
a
bit
more
there
okay
now
the
right
foot
she
swayed
a
little
in
my
grasp
on
the
first
slippery
section
of
that
dangerous
arch
of
rock
easy
that
it
honey
you
doing
fine
now
your
left
ah
okay
and
then
the
right
swell
step
by
nightmare
step
we
crossed
the
arch
snow
moving
her
feet
blindly
forward
in
exploratory
shuffles
and
i
forgetting
my
own
danger
in
my
concern
for
her
moving
steadily
with
her
eyeing
each
spot
on
that
rock
ahead
of
her
feet
for
safety
the
light
grew
dimmer
by
the
minute
as
we
crept
further
and
further
from
clatclit
i
wondered
how
long
i
could
have
stood
in
a
spray
of
liquid
caustic
or
acid
holding
a
light
for
some
friends
then
the
last
step
was
made
and
without
my
knowing
how
it
happened
snow
was
tightly
in
my
arms
facing
me
now
her
silky
hair
against
my
cheek
her
arms
locked
about
my
waist
easy
baby
easy
i
mumbled
into
her
ear
we
arrived
we
okay
just
relax
she
turned
her
face
up
to
mine
and
i
forgot
to
speak
suddenly
my
mouth
was
down
on
hers
hard
my
arms
crushing
her
against
me
we
clung
like
that
for
a
dizzy
moment
then
broke
apart
snow
i
gripped
her
wrists
and
held
her
there
staring
at
me
snow
darling
if
we
ever
get
out
of
this
alive
i
know
she
breathed
i
know
jery
i
love
you
i
kissed
her
again
gently
this
time
then
we
started
off
down
the
tunnel
away
from
clatclit
light
i
hoped
he
was
melted
beyond
repair
i
knew
though
after
that
shattering
exchange
of
affection
with
snow
that
i
sure
was
behind
us
the
light
vanished
i
looked
back
but
could
discern
neither
clatclit
nor
the
rock
bridge
nor
the
torrent
i
guess
we
feel
our
way
from
here
on
in
i
remarked
no
said
snow
halting
close
beside
me
there
up
ahead
jery
a
light
together
we
moved
down
the
tunnel
the
light
grew
in
intensity
then
we
reached
the
lighted
area
we
were
face
to
face
with
a
peculiar
stone
wall
no
other
tunnels
led
off
from
where
we
stood
there
was
no
direction
we
could
go
from
there
except
back
toward
that
perilous
underground
cataract
could
we
have
come
the
wrong
way
snow
asked
maybe
we
missed
a
turnoff
back
there
in
the
tunnel
where
it
was
darker
no
i
said
i
had
my
hands
feeling
the
walls
all
the
way
from
the
bridge
onward
until
we
could
see
our
way
this
must
be
the
right
place
then
on
a
sudden
instinctive
hunch
i
turned
to
snow
got
a
lipstick
in
that
handbag
of
yours
she
looked
at
me
blankly
but
nodded
and
produced
the
slim
metal
tube
for
my
inspection
i
took
it
from
her
fingers
slipped
off
the
cap
and
twirled
up
a
of
the
glossy
red
wax
now
let
see
if
i
right
about
this
wall
i
said
and
made
a
streaking
motion
across
the
rough
surface
with
the
lipstick
the
end
of
the
wax
cylinder
came
away
a
bit
disturbed
by
its
apparent
contact
with
the
surface
before
us
but
the
wall
held
no
trace
no
mark
not
even
a
smudge
i
saw
the
little
curls
of
wax
falling
down
the
face
of
the
wall
to
the
floor
of
the
tunnel
i
handed
the
lipstick
back
to
a
bewildered
snow
just
as
i
thought
i
said
that
honey
is
the
rock
known
as
parabolite
the
toughest
most
impervious
substance
in
the
solar
system
nothing
marks
it
scratches
it
or
even
budges
it
we
get
past
here
with
an
intercontinental
size
collapser
but
jery
look
snow
cried
pointing
at
the
wall
i
looked
the
flat
wall
of
parabolite
the
impervious
mineral
was
going
slowly
concave
in
the
center
i
took
hold
of
snow
by
the
shoulders
and
pulled
her
back
from
that
rapidly
deepening
hemisphere
expecting
i
do
know
i
was
expecting
but
i
was
scared
speechless
the
thing
bulged
back
away
from
us
until
its
diameter
was
equal
to
that
of
the
tunnel
itself
and
then
before
my
hypnotized
gaze
the
deepest
section
of
the
ruddy
mineral
gaped
like
a
hole
suddenly
pricked
in
the
side
of
a
bubble
the
remainder
of
the
parabolite
wrenched
violently
away
from
the
opening
leaving
us
a
clear
gateway
into
into
a
vast
chamber
of
metal
that
shifted
and
shimmered
in
some
fashion
that
made
me
want
to
turn
and
run
with
snow
back
down
that
black
tunnel
behind
us
come
in
jery
delvin
said
the
voice
of
an
snow
and
i
stepped
into
the
great
gleaming
chamber
i
was
very
much
disconcerted
when
the
wall
behind
us
contracted
suddenly
back
into
place
wherever
we
were
we
were
there
until
the
ancients
decided
to
let
us
out
who
is
the
person
with
you
said
a
voice
it
had
a
frowning
note
to
it
but
i
could
not
discern
the
source
of
the
words
anywhere
in
that
blur
of
metal
universe
that
spread
away
from
us
in
all
directions
she
i
said
as
boldly
as
possible
feeling
like
an
escapee
from
fenimore
cooper
she
is
my
woman
silence
then
she
will
be
allowed
allowed
to
what
i
demanded
allowed
to
be
said
the
voice
without
emotion
snow
fingers
nearly
went
through
my
hand
well
thanks
i
said
figuring
politeness
would
hurt
i
held
tight
to
snow
supplementing
our
hand
grip
with
an
lock
we
took
another
step
forward
where
are
you
i
asked
you
must
come
forward
said
the
voice
i
took
another
step
then
another
then
came
to
a
startled
halt
as
if
materializing
out
of
the
air
the
martian
was
before
me
i
stared
at
him
stupified
what
the
matter
jery
what
is
it
snow
said
then
she
looked
where
i
was
looking
giving
a
little
scream
it
all
right
honey
i
said
with
hollow
courage
he
a
little
impressionistic
but
he
she
cried
clinging
to
me
that
that
thing
i
looked
at
her
mystified
then
back
at
the
man
i
was
standing
before
he
made
my
head
spin
a
bit
what
with
apparently
seeing
him
from
front
view
and
both
profiles
simultaneously
but
he
was
mannish
looking
this
guy
the
martian
honey
i
said
maybe
you
did
take
enough
steps
forward
she
can
not
see
me
as
you
see
me
jery
delvin
said
the
martian
her
eyes
only
convey
to
her
a
fantastic
whirl
of
hideous
light
and
dark
shapes
she
along
with
most
others
of
your
race
can
not
apprehend
my
form
as
you
can
this
is
why
you
were
chosen
jery
delvin
that
crazy
i
protested
you
there
are
you
you
reflect
light
into
the
eyes
right
why
ca
she
see
you
the
human
eye
is
not
the
animal
eye
said
the
martian
an
animal
eye
sees
only
meaningless
shapes
animals
use
all
their
senses
to
identify
objects
but
the
human
eye
sees
concepts
jery
delvin
where
an
animal
merely
discerns
eyes
feeding
apparatus
and
breathing
vents
the
human
eye
sees
a
face
actually
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
face
it
was
true
enough
in
a
way
that
the
human
eye
tended
to
group
otherwise
unrelated
objects
into
concepts
of
reality
so
how
come
i
can
see
you
and
she
ca
i
reiterated
you
are
gifted
to
see
true
said
the
martian
your
mind
apprehends
concepts
where
it
has
previously
expected
to
find
none
you
relate
what
you
see
and
correctly
as
in
the
case
of
your
deriving
so
much
information
from
your
conversation
with
clatclit
another
man
would
not
have
succeeded
in
that
i
shook
my
head
confused
but
i
i
see
you
no
jery
delvin
your
mind
sees
me
your
eyes
alone
could
not
possibly
view
me
since
i
am
never
entirely
here
to
be
viewed
your
eyes
see
one
part
of
me
then
another
then
another
and
another
but
your
mind
rejects
the
idea
that
i
am
four
separate
entities
and
sees
me
as
i
am
a
unit
you
here
you
say
but
you
not
here
too
i
choked
feeling
positively
giddy
i
am
not
a
creature
said
the
martian
we
whom
you
call
the
ancients
are
existing
in
four
dimensions
i
thought
einsteinian
physics
says
that
is
the
fourth
dimension
i
said
slowly
it
is
not
said
the
martian
it
is
that
is
the
fourth
dimension
what
is
jery
delvin
or
remember
there
is
no
or
except
in
relationship
to
something
else
if
only
one
small
globe
of
rock
comprised
existing
matter
jery
delvin
where
would
it
be
it
that
silly
thing
ca
be
anywhere
i
said
it
just
be
floating
in
a
void
trying
to
picture
such
a
void
made
my
brain
whirl
i
gave
it
up
i
glad
you
understand
said
the
martian
very
well
then
we
your
ancients
are
existing
in
a
perfect
of
which
you
can
have
no
concept
at
all
we
are
living
in
not
location
but
in
itself
it
no
use
i
said
i
ca
even
picture
it
you
not
supposed
to
said
the
martian
with
a
mechanical
smile
of
contempt
even
your
mind
jery
delvin
can
not
fathom
the
magnitude
of
our
being
hold
on
a
minute
i
said
changing
the
subject
clatclit
told
me
that
you
expected
to
compel
my
cooperation
by
keeping
the
space
scouts
your
prisoners
unless
i
obeyed
you
that
is
correct
jery
delvin
and
so
our
desire
is
that
you
damn
it
i
exploded
stop
taking
so
much
for
granted
before
i
even
scratch
where
it
itches
to
please
you
guys
i
want
to
see
those
kids
and
in
damned
good
shape
too
snow
held
onto
my
arm
and
trembled
this
was
it
now
we
know
for
sure
if
the
boys
were
all
right
the
martian
looked
exasperated
but
then
he
reached
an
arm
out
from
himself
i
could
tell
exactly
without
getting
a
blinding
headache
just
which
way
his
arm
went
left
right
up
or
down
but
he
reached
away
from
himself
in
some
direction
or
other
and
the
next
moment
the
shimmering
blur
of
metallic
flooring
between
him
and
us
gave
way
to
a
platform
of
parabolite
which
rose
like
a
sluggish
elevator
on
narrow
rods
of
the
same
mineral
then
as
the
apparatus
halted
i
realized
that
these
rods
were
more
than
just
supports
for
that
slab
of
rock
they
were
bars
and
huddled
together
in
this
cage
i
saw
the
fifteen
missing
space
scouts
snow
one
of
the
boys
his
hair
as
raven
as
snow
was
blonde
tore
away
from
the
group
and
rushed
over
to
the
bars
jamming
his
arms
between
them
to
reach
out
for
her
ted
snow
cried
and
rushed
over
to
him
it
was
kind
of
awkward
embracing
with
the
bars
in
the
way
but
they
did
it
anyhow
ted
dear
ted
are
you
all
right
yeah
he
said
with
a
note
of
uncertainty
yeah
i
guess
we
are
only
i
was
almost
giving
up
on
you
have
you
the
martian
icy
voice
cut
into
the
reunion
seen
quite
enough
hold
your
horses
i
hollered
at
him
through
the
cage
she
checked
him
for
broken
bones
yet
the
martian
whether
out
of
patience
or
alien
incomprehension
of
my
sarcasm
left
the
cage
where
it
was
and
stood
waiting
i
knew
you
get
my
message
snow
said
ted
eagerly
quite
forgetting
his
doubts
of
a
few
seconds
before
i
just
knew
it
when
do
we
get
out
of
here
hey
we
want
to
go
home
apparently
adventure
lost
its
tang
when
the
cage
had
first
been
lowered
into
the
the
whatever
it
was
that
served
us
as
a
floor
the
other
boys
had
come
up
to
the
bars
now
all
of
them
looking
at
snow
with
longing
as
the
next
best
thing
to
a
mother
oh
you
poor
kids
snow
sobbed
suddenly
have
they
been
feeding
you
when
did
you
last
wash
your
face
ted
they
do
feed
us
at
all
ted
said
sorrowfully
it
been
weeks
now
since
we
ran
out
of
candy
and
jery
delvin
the
martian
voice
interrupted
imperiously
before
that
look
on
your
woman
face
erupts
into
some
more
of
her
tiresome
vituperation
will
you
explain
to
her
what
a
metabolic
stasis
is
sure
i
said
folding
my
arms
as
soon
as
you
explain
it
to
me
the
martian
seemed
to
be
gathering
himself
for
a
cry
of
utter
exasperation
then
he
caught
hold
of
himself
and
said
with
rigid
calm
we
merely
have
held
the
children
within
a
field
of
radiation
that
obviates
the
necessity
of
their
taking
alimental
nourishment
snow
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
me
wonderingly
he
means
honey
that
they
fixed
it
somehow
so
the
kids
did
need
to
eat
i
guess
it
was
simpler
than
running
a
catering
service
did
need
to
eat
she
exploded
does
that
blob
of
black
sparklers
know
that
growing
boys
need
food
to
grow
there
no
need
to
be
redundant
said
the
martian
to
what
she
cried
standing
back
from
the
cage
to
glare
at
him
the
better
with
arms
akimbo
the
martian
took
this
golden
opportunity
to
let
the
cage
drop
suddenly
back
out
of
our
ken
the
shimmering
blur
of
metallic
luster
was
once
more
at
our
feet
oh
she
cried
stepping
forward
and
staring
down
ted
teddy
jery
jery
jery
snow
murmured
tearfully
turning
about
and
burrowing
her
nose
into
my
chest
while
i
held
her
helplessly
he
looked
hungry
i
decided
to
let
her
sob
neither
i
nor
the
martian
no
matter
what
our
brain
power
could
drive
this
fixed
notion
out
of
her
pretty
little
head
now
that
you
have
seen
them
said
the
martian
perhaps
we
can
get
to
the
business
at
hand
i
seemed
to
be
out
of
dilatory
alibis
okay
i
said
what
do
you
want
from
me
we
want
you
to
destroy
philip
baxter
said
the
martian
destroy
baxter
i
echoed
stupidly
i
was
dragged
all
the
way
from
earth
to
do
that
since
we
are
here
and
you
were
there
said
the
martian
condescendingly
what
other
choice
did
we
have
you
could
have
sent
a
letter
i
muttered
hardly
the
martian
said
unperturbed
since
physical
contact
between
our
two
dimensions
is
impossible
it
is
i
said
surprised
of
course
the
martian
snapped
if
it
were
not
we
have
destroyed
baxter
ourselves
why
did
you
use
the
sugarfeet
i
asked
bewildered
clatclit
seems
to
have
shown
no
ineptness
in
disintegrating
other
earthmen
for
the
simple
reason
said
the
martian
with
cold
anger
that
on
your
wretchedly
humid
planet
a
sugarfoot
would
be
corroded
to
death
before
it
could
locate
him
if
of
course
it
had
already
overcome
the
other
obvious
difficulties
such
as
getting
there
since
earth
does
not
permit
immigration
of
alien
species
like
a
hot
spark
flaring
where
only
ice
had
been
before
a
tiny
light
of
hope
began
to
burn
in
my
heart
the
martians
for
all
their
superiority
did
know
that
baxter
was
on
mars
hell
why
should
they
i
knew
baxter
personally
and
i
did
know
he
was
on
mars
until
he
was
good
and
ready
to
let
me
know
it
jery
said
snow
about
to
spill
the
beans
ixnay
lover
i
growled
unless
you
want
these
guys
tossing
in
the
hand
and
switching
to
plan
c
remember
i
hoped
she
recall
what
had
happened
to
those
rebels
once
the
ancients
no
longer
had
a
use
for
them
i
could
tell
a
second
later
by
her
involuntary
gasp
that
she
did
what
was
the
import
of
that
exchange
the
martian
asked
fairly
smoldering
with
suspicion
your
idioms
were
elusive
my
woman
was
about
to
beg
me
not
to
do
your
will
i
lied
carefully
i
merely
pointed
out
to
her
that
if
i
refused
you
would
simply
obliterate
us
and
utilize
some
other
scheme
intelligent
thinking
jery
delvin
said
the
martian
for
a
horrible
moment
i
thought
he
meant
he
caught
onto
my
misinterpretation
of
my
words
then
i
knew
all
was
well
relatively
as
he
went
on
as
to
the
method
of
destruction
we
leave
it
to
you
to
choose
however
haste
is
of
paramount
importance
to
us
excuse
me
i
interrupted
but
would
you
answer
me
one
probably
idiotic
question
if
it
is
within
my
range
of
information
said
the
martian
well
just
why
are
you
so
set
on
getting
rid
of
baxter
mind
you
i
have
no
overwhelming
affection
for
him
myself
but
i
ca
figure
your
angle
the
motivation
is
the
usual
basic
one
even
you
humans
follow
it
survival
survival
i
repeated
blinking
philip
baxter
possesses
the
knowledge
of
the
method
of
our
destruction
said
the
martian
that
in
itself
is
a
bad
thing
but
he
has
two
more
things
besides
this
knowledge
that
make
his
removal
imperative
he
also
possesses
the
means
and
the
intention
of
using
this
means
what
said
snow
losing
the
pedantic
thread
he
means
honey
that
baxter
not
only
got
the
knowhow
to
bump
off
this
bunch
but
the
wherewithal
and
the
urge
you
earthmen
have
a
rather
colorful
succinctness
of
speech
the
martian
observed
snow
looked
at
me
for
help
we
what
i
grinned
at
her
despite
our
situation
we
talk
purty
i
interpreted
then
turning
back
to
the
martian
but
if
there
can
not
be
physical
contact
between
the
races
why
worry
about
baxter
it
seems
to
me
that
the
worst
he
could
do
is
snub
you
i
better
give
you
a
bit
more
detail
wait
a
minute
i
held
up
a
hand
in
protest
if
you
tell
me
what
baxter
knows
then
wo
i
be
a
threat
to
us
no
i
do
not
intend
to
tell
you
the
specific
manner
in
which
we
can
be
destroyed
simply
the
nature
of
the
destruction
all
right
what
you
aware
of
course
of
the
geocentric
theory
of
the
universe
mmmm
i
heard
of
it
is
that
the
theory
once
held
by
people
on
earth
that
the
earth
was
the
center
of
all
creation
and
the
sun
revolved
around
it
not
that
is
the
one
now
though
your
race
believed
it
to
be
a
false
theory
it
is
false
i
protested
for
earth
yes
but
not
you
see
for
mars
this
place
where
you
now
stand
this
brief
between
our
dimension
and
yours
is
the
center
of
your
physical
universe
you
crazy
i
said
why
the
sun
alone
is
too
massive
to
swing
about
this
planet
let
alone
everything
else
it
be
like
a
small
boy
trying
to
twirl
a
boulder
on
the
end
of
a
rope
even
if
he
managed
somehow
to
get
it
started
in
motion
within
ten
seconds
be
swinging
him
and
if
this
small
boy
had
another
boulder
on
the
other
side
of
him
well
uh
and
another
one
above
and
below
and
in
all
directions
from
him
what
then
i
thought
it
over
he
be
a
mighty
tired
boy
that
is
not
funny
it
needs
work
i
admitted
jery
delvin
said
the
martian
with
open
irritation
time
is
fleeting
and
i
can
not
afford
to
dally
while
you
play
semantic
pingpong
with
my
words
kindly
allow
me
to
complete
my
statement
of
this
situation
or
i
shall
decide
by
your
flippancy
that
you
no
longer
desire
the
companionship
of
your
woman
that
one
i
detected
by
the
sudden
stiffening
of
snow
hand
in
mine
i
did
need
to
translate
i
shut
up
this
then
the
martian
went
on
more
calmly
is
despite
what
your
scientists
say
the
center
of
your
universe
if
they
will
but
compute
the
masses
orbits
and
velocities
of
all
other
matter
in
the
universe
they
will
see
that
or
are
they
yet
aware
of
the
universe
in
its
entirety
not
not
quite
i
said
carefully
not
wanting
to
chance
losing
snow
our
astronomical
instruments
have
a
limited
sensitivity
to
light
we
see
pretty
damned
far
but
there
always
something
more
beyond
very
well
then
you
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
however
if
you
have
properly
understood
the
fact
that
our
dimension
exists
at
the
place
of
location
itself
you
will
see
at
once
that
our
only
possible
point
of
contact
with
your
universe
is
at
the
central
point
i
think
i
see
i
said
if
you
tried
making
contact
anywhere
else
it
go
speeding
off
from
you
so
to
speak
good
you
understand
perfectly
what
baxter
proposes
to
do
is
to
break
our
liaison
thus
confining
us
to
our
own
dimension
forever
he
proposes
to
do
this
by
detonating
a
segment
of
our
physical
universe
one
which
coexists
with
yours
this
will
produce
only
the
slightest
of
jolts
in
our
world
but
the
balance
between
the
two
universes
is
so
delicate
that
even
this
minor
tremor
will
move
us
by
moving
our
out
of
alignment
and
we
since
we
exist
in
location
can
not
then
move
ourselves
back
would
uh
would
that
be
so
terrible
i
asked
nervously
what
do
you
gain
by
the
contact
anyhow
the
contact
said
the
martian
it
is
something
we
have
always
had
we
do
need
it
but
we
like
less
the
idea
of
having
it
arbitrarily
taken
from
us
oh
i
said
i
do
suppose
you
happen
to
know
baxter
angle
in
all
this
i
mean
the
reason
for
his
urge
to
destroy
you
power
the
martian
said
simply
you
have
heard
of
the
amnesty
of
course
have
i
i
muttered
well
then
you
know
that
the
wearer
can
not
be
countermanded
by
any
but
the
combined
veto
of
the
world
president
and
philip
baxter
himself
yes
i
said
puzzled
then
who
if
philip
baxter
were
to
wear
the
amnesty
could
countermand
him
i
realized
with
a
shock
that
no
one
on
the
three
planets
of
domain
could
the
way
the
rules
were
set
up
but
people
would
stand
for
a
dictator
i
argued
they
vote
out
the
power
of
the
amnesty
and
if
there
was
no
more
vote
jery
delvin
interplanetary
security
is
currently
the
most
powerful
organization
in
your
world
its
agents
possess
the
most
invincible
of
weapons
the
collapser
philip
baxter
wields
the
power
even
now
but
he
desires
that
it
should
become
known
known
said
snow
uncertainly
he
means
snow
that
it
no
fun
being
the
boss
if
nobody
knows
it
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
think
baxter
can
actually
get
away
with
it
i
returned
my
attention
to
the
martian
if
he
held
off
taking
over
until
you
people
were
unhitched
from
our
universe
then
you
must
be
a
threat
to
him
only
in
his
mind
jery
delvin
he
learned
that
we
exist
he
also
learned
that
we
had
abilities
he
decided
that
we
therefore
were
superior
in
knowledge
of
weapons
of
destruction
one
can
not
be
a
successful
dictator
when
another
being
has
more
power
or
if
one
thinks
such
is
the
case
then
you
have
such
weapons
we
have
but
as
i
told
you
physical
contact
between
our
races
is
impossible
it
gave
a
shrug
any
attempt
on
our
part
to
use
our
weapons
would
result
in
that
very
jolt
we
are
trying
so
desperately
to
avoid
i
get
it
you
can
shoot
the
charging
rhino
but
the
recoil
knocks
you
off
the
cliff
overly
metaphoric
but
substantially
correct
so
you
must
destroy
baxter
for
us
i
like
nothing
better
i
can
get
back
to
earth
and
alert
the
president
and
maybe
get
the
wheels
rolling
for
an
investigation
of
is
impossible
the
martian
snapped
we
dare
not
wait
any
longer
as
yet
baxter
has
confided
his
to
no
one
once
he
tells
another
man
then
that
man
tells
a
third
and
soon
we
become
hopelessly
vulnerable
no
the
man
himself
must
be
destroyed
not
just
his
power
when
he
dies
the
power
will
die
with
him
if
you
then
tell
your
story
but
i
ca
just
walk
up
to
him
and
kill
him
i
said
since
we
are
completely
aware
that
you
can
i
must
take
it
that
you
mean
you
will
not
no
not
that
exactly
but
look
he
been
a
stinker
i
know
but
not
in
my
power
to
destroy
a
fellow
human
being
in
cold
blood
then
we
shall
heat
your
blood
jery
delvin
the
martian
replied
we
will
warm
it
with
the
racking
anger
you
shall
feel
against
us
knowing
that
these
human
children
shall
perish
if
you
fail
a
cunning
light
came
into
the
martian
eyes
and
not
only
these
children
it
said
but
your
woman
as
well
no
i
cried
grabbing
hold
of
snow
in
both
my
arms
i
do
it
but
just
leave
her
alone
she
stays
here
with
us
until
you
return
successful
she
does
not
i
yelled
shaking
i
ca
leave
the
woman
i
love
with
a
creep
that
looks
to
her
like
a
blob
of
black
sparklers
i
with
cold
horror
i
realized
that
my
arms
were
embracing
nothingness
snow
was
standing
ten
feet
away
jery
she
cried
trying
to
come
toward
me
instead
her
steps
slid
over
that
shimmering
metallic
blur
and
she
remained
in
place
we
who
live
in
the
heart
of
location
said
the
martian
affably
have
a
certain
mastery
over
locale
you
ca
do
this
i
said
unreasonably
because
it
was
quite
obvious
it
was
being
done
inexorably
snow
i
said
and
could
go
on
the
vision
of
snow
was
moving
back
from
me
or
i
was
moving
backward
or
both
but
the
gap
between
us
widened
by
the
second
then
i
was
back
in
the
rocky
red
tunnel
the
parabolite
sphincter
narrowing
swiftly
before
my
face
be
be
careful
snow
i
called
like
an
imbecile
the
wall
was
solid
again
simultaneous
with
that
parabolite
wall
shutting
in
my
face
three
disturbing
thoughts
occurred
to
me
one
baxter
did
have
the
amnesty
snow
did
probably
in
that
handbag
of
hers
two
if
the
ancients
could
float
me
and
snow
and
the
space
scouts
about
like
so
much
helium
why
the
hell
did
they
just
baxter
into
a
snake
pit
or
something
and
three
if
physical
contact
was
impossible
between
the
races
how
in
heaven
name
did
they
gimmick
the
brain
back
on
earth
which
was
also
come
to
think
of
it
moving
awfully
fast
in
relation
to
their
with
the
geocentric
point
of
the
universe
a
very
baffled
man
i
began
feeling
my
way
down
the
tunnel
toward
that
mighty
roar
of
underground
waters
the
light
paled
and
grew
gray
as
i
moved
away
from
the
parabolite
wall
then
i
was
in
darkness
feeling
the
bare
stone
with
my
fingers
as
i
stepped
carefully
toward
the
increasing
volume
of
ragged
sound
then
the
wall
curved
away
from
my
outstretched
fingertips
and
i
knew
i
stood
at
the
brink
of
that
precarious
arch
of
rock
there
was
nothing
but
blackness
there
now
clatclit
i
hollered
over
the
boom
of
the
river
waters
clatclit
it
me
jery
the
rush
of
the
boiling
rapids
was
too
great
however
it
thundered
by
and
swept
the
faint
vibration
of
my
voice
along
with
it
into
that
enormous
well
to
my
right
then
i
remembered
clatclit
manner
of
instruction
to
that
beast
what
seemed
like
ages
ago
out
on
the
craggy
martian
hillside
i
put
hooked
thumb
and
forefinger
into
my
mouth
and
let
off
a
piercing
whistle
ahead
of
me
in
the
darkness
there
was
a
glimmering
of
visibility
and
then
a
feeble
pink
taillight
waggled
slowly
up
and
down
far
back
beyond
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
clatclit
was
chancing
moving
as
close
to
the
spray
as
before
however
though
a
more
powerful
beam
had
been
necessary
to
see
by
when
i
been
moving
into
darkness
the
pale
glow
was
sufficient
for
the
return
trip
all
i
needed
was
a
beacon
something
to
sight
upon
so
i
would
go
astray
in
my
slow
crawl
across
that
slippery
curve
of
rock
yes
crawl
this
trip
i
negotiated
the
arch
on
hands
and
knees
and
then
i
was
across
and
hurrying
down
the
corridor
to
the
bend
around
which
clatclit
shivered
and
waited
he
stood
up
from
his
slouch
against
the
wall
from
which
weary
stance
he
been
waving
me
onward
with
his
taillight
wow
i
said
catching
dim
sight
of
him
in
the
weak
glow
of
his
trylon
the
sharp
ruby
glint
was
missing
from
his
erstwhile
pyramidic
facets
now
they
looked
dull
crimson
and
ropy
like
taffy
that
has
congealed
after
boiling
over
and
dribbling
down
the
side
of
the
saucepan
does
it
hurt
i
asked
feeling
partially
responsible
motion
it
bothers
you
in
some
way
though
is
that
it
nod
how
i
asked
unable
to
think
of
a
question
clatclit
pointed
to
my
wrist
shook
his
head
pointed
to
my
wrist
again
and
gestured
upward
then
nodded
time
no
other
time
uh
earth
headshake
he
rose
on
tiptoe
and
pointed
up
again
beyond
earth
the
sun
nod
you
mean
that
at
this
time
it
does
bother
you
but
it
will
later
when
you
need
the
scales
for
absorbing
sunlight
a
very
weary
nod
damn
that
rough
will
they
grow
back
again
pause
nod
tiptoe
point
three
taps
on
wrist
shrug
yes
when
the
sun
makes
three
times
in
three
days
time
nod
hands
clasped
to
belly
disgusted
shrug
but
in
the
meantime
you
go
hungry
sort
of
nod
then
the
social
amenities
taken
care
of
clatclit
pointed
to
me
to
the
ground
and
looked
questioningly
the
ancients
have
decided
i
to
bump
off
baxter
i
said
then
they
release
snow
and
the
boys
not
before
clatclit
stared
at
me
a
moment
placed
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
shook
his
head
like
a
sympathetic
friend
then
he
took
his
claws
and
made
a
tugging
struggling
motion
with
them
as
though
trying
to
tear
something
which
would
give
he
followed
it
up
with
an
incongruously
comic
motion
to
the
back
of
his
hand
it
was
his
devious
way
of
expressing
the
slang
phrase
tough
luck
you
said
it
i
muttered
come
on
though
the
less
time
i
leave
snow
with
the
blob
of
black
sparklers
the
better
i
got
to
get
to
the
spaceport
clatclit
nodded
and
began
his
lumbering
waddle
off
into
the
labyrinth
the
ancients
probably
expected
me
to
book
passage
on
the
next
earth
flight
to
assassinate
baxter
they
did
know
he
was
sitting
right
in
their
laps
in
the
security
sector
of
the
field
it
was
just
as
well
i
did
relish
the
possibility
of
my
elimination
if
they
knew
he
was
right
where
a
sugarfoot
could
blast
him
as
well
as
anybody
as
i
trailed
clatclit
up
the
wearisome
slope
that
was
taking
us
to
the
surface
i
did
some
heavy
thinking
the
ancients
before
earthmen
first
landed
on
mars
probably
had
wandered
about
the
planet
freely
on
the
surface
living
in
their
dwellings
of
parabolite
using
their
artifacts
of
the
same
impervious
mineral
then
earth
that
paradoxically
and
planet
lands
colonists
the
ancients
just
from
plain
discretion
hide
themselves
and
observe
these
unwelcome
newcomers
once
it
becomes
clear
to
them
that
there
is
a
potential
menace
from
baxter
who
is
no
young
chicken
having
been
in
power
before
the
first
landing
they
stay
hidden
and
start
scheming
to
get
rid
of
this
guy
who
can
jolt
them
out
of
their
liaison
i
pondered
over
that
bit
the
ancient
had
said
that
baxter
intended
doing
it
by
detonating
a
portion
of
their
hell
they
must
mean
parabolite
what
other
substance
in
the
solar
system
was
so
alien
to
and
with
that
thought
i
suddenly
knew
the
secret
of
that
apparently
impervious
mineral
strength
no
wonder
it
could
not
be
destroyed
it
was
only
in
existence
in
our
skimpy
three
dimensions
in
a
fractional
way
of
it
was
always
present
in
the
ancients
world
since
it
could
into
our
universe
in
its
entirety
and
that
meant
not
only
of
its
apparent
mass
but
of
even
its
atomic
structure
even
the
collapsers
working
on
subatomic
particles
were
at
a
disadvantage
you
ca
nudge
an
electron
out
of
orbit
if
it
actually
fixed
in
that
orbit
of
those
electrons
were
always
cushioned
by
that
elusive
final
segment
that
lay
outside
our
universe
so
trying
to
destroy
parabolite
by
force
was
in
the
same
class
as
trying
to
shatter
a
rubber
ball
with
a
hammer
a
rubber
ball
which
was
hanging
from
an
elastic
cord
in
fact
it
just
gave
into
the
other
dimension
and
rebounded
frisky
as
ever
boy
i
thought
this
is
going
to
put
the
skids
under
that
scientific
theory
about
parabolite
imperviousness
parabolic
molecules
ha
well
it
was
a
good
theory
while
it
lasted
it
fit
the
known
facts
at
least
hell
the
stuff
even
has
the
wrong
name
it
ought
to
be
called
or
some
such
euphonic
label
clatclit
paused
in
his
climb
up
the
tunnel
slope
and
turned
a
querying
stare
on
me
was
i
talking
aloud
i
asked
curious
nod
sorry
it
nothing
i
said
indicating
that
he
should
proceed
with
our
journey
just
the
salesman
in
me
coming
to
life
you
ca
have
public
interest
without
catchy
once
an
ad
man
always
an
ad
man
clatclit
looked
positively
bewildered
sorry
business
talk
i
explained
he
shrugged
and
continued
his
upward
climb
with
me
tagging
after
the
bobbing
pink
taillight
as
secure
as
the
security
prison
was
supposed
to
be
we
got
in
with
no
trouble
the
planet
must
be
a
regular
of
those
rocky
tubes
if
you
know
the
layout
you
can
apparently
get
anywhere
from
anywhere
our
only
excursion
from
the
steady
upward
climb
had
been
a
brief
in
one
of
those
rooms
clatclit
picked
up
my
collapser
and
returned
it
to
me
i
felt
infinitely
more
confidant
of
success
with
its
thick
golden
handle
jutting
out
of
my
holster
once
more
perhaps
i
could
just
find
baxter
sneak
a
bolt
into
his
face
and
scurry
off
into
the
labyrinth
on
clatclit
heels
i
knew
even
as
i
thought
it
that
i
would
be
able
to
just
blast
him
like
that
i
probably
have
to
face
up
to
him
pull
an
all
right
pardner
draw
sort
of
sentence
on
him
and
then
pray
that
i
was
faster
it
was
unthinkable
for
me
to
act
in
any
other
manner
the
instinct
was
part
of
our
national
heritage
something
called
the
code
of
the
west
handed
down
to
us
by
pioneer
forefathers
the
method
of
ingress
to
the
building
was
simplicity
itself
the
tunnel
we
been
negotiating
came
to
an
abrupt
end
at
a
wall
of
granite
slabs
such
as
had
buttressed
my
prison
cell
i
reached
for
the
collapser
but
clatclit
laid
a
restraining
claw
on
my
hand
i
watched
curious
as
he
put
his
left
to
the
wall
and
listened
intently
then
seeming
satisfied
he
put
his
hands
on
the
biggest
slab
of
granite
and
pushed
nothing
happened
for
a
moment
then
the
slab
began
to
pivot
about
some
central
axis
and
a
gap
was
exposed
on
either
side
of
its
bulk
beyond
the
open
spaces
bright
fluorescent
tubing
lighted
a
grim
prison
corridor
is
there
an
easier
way
to
the
spaceport
i
said
a
prison
meant
guards
and
guards
meant
collapsers
and
collapsers
meant
possibly
jery
delvin
but
clatclit
shrugged
pointed
into
the
tunnel
and
made
motions
with
both
hands
all
the
while
shaking
his
head
in
weary
disgust
there
is
but
it
take
forever
to
get
there
huh
i
interpreted
he
nodded
oh
well
clatclit
leading
the
way
we
sidled
through
the
gap
then
he
pressed
the
mammoth
stone
back
into
place
you
coming
with
me
all
the
way
i
asked
surprised
somehow
thought
his
guideship
ended
at
the
same
place
the
tunnel
did
clatclit
nodded
vigorously
is
it
that
the
ancients
do
trust
me
headshake
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
negative
okay
i
bite
why
clatclit
stepped
toward
me
placed
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
then
placed
his
free
hand
over
my
heart
moved
it
over
his
own
held
up
two
fingers
and
crossed
them
because
we
friends
i
said
softly
clatclit
nodded
it
took
us
an
hour
to
locate
baxter
clatclit
showed
no
signs
of
surprise
when
i
did
not
go
to
the
ticket
office
and
book
a
passage
for
earth
apparently
not
being
in
on
the
finer
points
of
the
scheme
he
found
no
wild
incongruity
in
my
being
brought
all
the
way
from
earth
to
obliterate
a
man
who
could
just
as
easily
have
been
dispatched
by
a
sugarfoot
or
else
through
some
extrasensory
awareness
something
born
of
our
friendship
he
knew
that
imparting
the
location
of
baxter
to
the
ancients
might
well
mean
my
death
whatever
his
reasons
clatclit
simply
followed
me
in
my
progress
through
the
prison
dungeon
which
thanks
to
its
completely
cells
was
left
without
guards
we
went
up
into
the
more
section
of
the
building
the
warmly
halls
that
were
open
to
the
public
who
passed
through
the
security
inspection
when
entering
or
leaving
the
planet
it
was
good
business
to
hide
the
grimmer
realities
from
colonists
or
casual
tourists
and
those
who
learned
about
the
dungeons
were
never
in
a
position
to
pass
the
word
around
your
first
view
of
a
security
dungeon
was
usually
your
last
view
of
anything
the
public
part
of
the
building
had
too
many
people
in
it
to
suit
me
even
if
i
could
get
by
the
flight
officials
and
unchallenged
clatclit
could
the
building
was
rigidly
to
extraterrestrials
so
we
went
up
the
outside
built
against
and
a
good
ways
into
the
high
hills
that
surrounded
the
town
the
building
was
easy
prey
for
anyone
who
cared
to
clamber
up
the
rocky
slopes
from
which
it
jutted
and
climb
through
a
window
these
slopes
were
lighted
but
not
patrolled
after
all
under
ordinary
circumstances
no
one
in
his
right
mind
would
try
sneaking
into
an
is
stronghold
baxter
as
it
turned
out
was
seated
at
a
desk
not
unlike
his
own
back
on
earth
in
the
very
office
where
i
been
last
interrogated
by
the
team
of
charlie
and
foster
he
was
staring
into
space
and
smoking
a
cigar
the
solitary
incandescent
lamp
on
his
desk
making
his
mane
of
hair
a
sort
of
angelic
aurora
about
that
pleasantly
rubicund
face
it
was
like
seeing
satan
sporting
a
medal
clatclit
and
i
were
crouched
outside
the
window
on
a
narrow
ledge
reached
from
the
slope
to
my
intense
interest
lying
before
baxter
in
the
glaring
circle
of
lamplight
was
the
black
shirt
i
been
wearing
when
i
was
rescued
by
clatclit
the
shirt
which
had
been
towed
off
by
that
to
obviate
baxter
being
able
to
track
the
route
of
my
flight
i
was
about
to
whisper
a
question
about
the
shirt
to
clatclit
when
baxter
turned
partway
about
in
his
chair
and
started
to
stub
out
the
cigar
in
a
black
onyx
ashtray
the
question
stuck
in
my
throat
as
i
caught
sight
of
baxter
breast
on
a
silver
chain
about
his
throat
he
wore
the
amnesty
something
was
very
definitely
wrong
until
that
moment
when
baxter
turned
i
been
certain
that
the
amnesty
was
in
snow
possession
and
now
here
it
was
gleaming
in
bright
red
and
bronze
against
the
front
of
his
crisp
black
linen
blouse
the
sight
of
it
twanged
a
chord
in
my
mind
and
i
crouched
there
on
that
narrow
ledge
trying
to
grasp
the
fleeting
thread
of
thought
the
amnesty
was
exactly
the
same
color
as
that
parabolite
wall
down
in
the
tunnels
the
barrier
to
the
lair
of
the
ancients
was
it
a
coincidence
that
this
token
of
power
was
designed
to
match
in
shade
and
intensity
of
color
that
unearthly
mineral
of
another
dimension
a
queer
notion
began
to
take
root
in
my
mind
baxter
had
given
me
the
amnesty
before
i
set
off
to
find
the
missing
boys
or
had
he
was
that
the
amnesty
i
carried
or
a
copy
a
perfect
duplicate
constructed
not
of
metal
but
the
impervious
mineral
my
brain
was
spinning
as
little
unimportant
facts
suddenly
burgeoned
and
grew
and
took
on
terrible
significance
according
to
our
science
parabolite
was
invulnerable
to
all
tools
and
could
not
be
worked
or
shaped
yet
the
martian
had
said
to
me
that
baxter
possessed
the
means
to
disengage
the
fragile
bond
that
linked
the
two
dimensions
by
the
truth
came
home
to
me
with
an
icy
shock
by
detonating
a
portion
of
their
and
the
amnesty
my
amnesty
was
that
material
i
looked
past
baxter
to
the
black
blouse
its
lining
sparkling
beneath
the
incandescent
lamplight
with
thousands
of
tiny
metal
filaments
and
then
i
knew
at
last
baxter
monstrous
plan
cold
fury
welled
up
inside
me
i
could
easily
at
that
moment
have
leveled
my
collapser
at
him
and
flashed
him
out
of
existence
with
no
more
feeling
than
that
engendered
by
crushing
a
gnat
between
finger
and
thumb
my
hand
was
sliding
back
toward
that
cold
metal
handle
jutting
from
my
holster
when
there
came
an
interruption
the
door
before
baxter
desk
opened
and
charlie
and
foster
came
in
clatclit
and
i
ducked
back
from
the
pane
and
listened
holding
our
breaths
about
time
baxter
growled
since
you
two
are
alone
i
assume
this
was
another
wild
goose
chase
his
fist
slammed
down
atop
the
crumpled
shirt
and
i
caught
his
meaning
apparently
when
they
discovered
my
cell
empty
tracked
my
trail
by
whatever
electronic
device
followed
up
the
location
of
that
rigged
garment
and
had
been
led
miles
astray
in
the
martian
desert
finding
only
the
empty
blouse
at
the
end
of
their
quest
yes
and
no
sir
charlie
said
it
it
the
weirdest
thing
well
what
baxter
snapped
angrily
charlie
while
replying
was
unhitching
a
sort
of
tanklike
apparatus
from
his
back
from
which
a
flexible
tube
ran
into
the
end
of
the
pistol
at
his
belt
with
the
surprise
of
sudden
memory
i
recognized
one
of
the
weapons
of
the
earlier
settlers
at
marsport
a
water
pistol
with
ammunition
tanks
we
got
out
the
pack
sir
when
we
returned
yes
yes
baxter
interrupted
violently
you
took
the
dogs
and
trailed
delvin
by
scent
from
his
cell
fine
but
did
you
find
him
we
had
trouble
sir
it
was
outside
the
crater
and
the
dogs
needed
muzzles
which
cut
down
their
sense
of
smell
and
the
trail
was
spread
way
out
too
as
if
delvin
had
only
touched
the
ground
every
thirty
feet
or
so
i
remembered
clatclit
bounding
transportation
from
the
cell
and
had
to
smile
the
dogs
must
have
been
starting
and
stopping
every
five
minutes
over
that
sporadic
trail
baxter
at
the
end
of
his
patience
flattened
both
hands
on
the
desktop
and
grated
spacing
his
words
for
emphasis
did
you
find
him
charlie
exchanged
a
look
with
foster
then
hung
his
head
no
sir
we
did
lost
the
trail
i
suppose
baxter
growled
no
we
kept
at
it
all
right
charlie
said
it
took
us
underground
into
the
lava
tunnels
and
grottos
we
even
found
a
cot
where
he
been
sleeping
i
stared
at
clatclit
they
done
better
than
i
thought
possible
clatclit
tilted
his
head
to
one
side
and
shrugged
it
meant
the
same
thing
in
both
our
languages
of
course
you
idiot
baxter
said
with
disgust
it
obvious
he
had
help
from
the
sugarfeet
i
have
guessed
that
the
moment
i
saw
the
intervals
of
his
trail
what
else
but
a
man
carried
by
a
sugarfoot
could
travel
in
bounds
like
that
gravity
here
only
half
that
of
earth
charlie
protested
weakly
even
so
baxter
muttered
only
an
olympic
champ
could
make
leaps
like
that
you
seen
delvin
did
you
really
think
that
gawky
frame
of
his
had
such
galvanic
energy
i
could
resent
his
slurs
later
right
now
i
wanted
to
find
out
just
how
damned
far
those
guys
had
tracked
me
but
we
finally
came
to
a
bridge
over
an
underground
river
sir
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
beyond
it
the
trail
came
to
a
dead
end
in
front
of
a
whole
damned
wall
of
parabolite
and
something
about
that
wall
scared
hell
out
of
the
dogs
too
they
were
whining
high
up
the
scale
like
they
do
when
there
something
wrong
and
growling
at
that
wall
sir
halfway
through
charlie
discourse
i
had
jerked
my
head
around
to
stare
a
baffled
question
at
clatclit
where
i
was
about
to
ask
him
were
you
when
the
posse
scuttled
by
but
he
already
anticipated
the
question
and
i
watched
as
he
pointed
to
himself
then
made
a
serpentine
with
his
hand
then
an
motion
with
his
palms
over
his
torso
you
scooted
up
the
tunnel
for
a
brisk
toweling
i
said
a
firm
nod
i
could
blame
him
after
all
snow
and
i
were
gone
for
a
spell
no
reason
for
him
to
stand
there
and
melt
with
the
water
already
beading
his
hide
so
that
meant
that
charlie
and
foster
were
outside
the
wall
while
snow
and
i
were
in
council
with
the
martian
i
found
i
was
glad
clatclit
had
been
there
to
spot
them
because
if
he
had
been
and
they
had
those
water
guns
i
have
found
nothing
but
a
sticky
puddle
where
i
left
a
friend
if
indeed
i
been
able
to
get
back
that
far
baxter
voice
interrupted
my
thoughts
and
so
he
said
mockingly
bitter
you
return
once
again
not
quite
sir
said
foster
stepping
forward
and
setting
a
trim
plastic
rectangle
on
end
atop
the
desk
we
found
this
just
outside
that
wall
it
was
snow
handbag
probably
she
dropped
it
in
her
initial
fright
when
that
wall
had
gaped
open
before
us
i
had
noticed
it
then
because
i
been
pretty
shaken
too
and
when
i
made
my
ungracious
exit
from
the
martian
den
the
handbag
was
already
gone
on
its
way
up
to
baxter
via
foster
apparently
clatclit
had
known
a
shorter
route
to
the
is
building
than
the
is
men
did
baxter
had
the
bag
in
his
hands
now
staring
at
it
with
the
first
faint
flush
of
elation
coming
into
his
face
but
this
must
be
that
girl
bag
the
one
who
stole
that
other
amnesty
it
hit
me
like
a
blow
in
the
stomach
of
course
baxter
had
had
no
idea
that
i
was
with
snow
not
until
now
and
he
knew
snow
had
that
amnesty
the
one
he
planned
to
use
to
blow
the
martians
out
of
our
dimension
and
now
he
knew
where
she
was
deep
in
the
rock
of
the
planet
with
a
virtual
bomb
on
a
chain
about
her
neck
he
did
need
his
gimmicked
blouse
any
longer
the
one
he
was
going
to
use
to
track
me
until
i
was
in
the
chamber
of
the
ancients
that
had
been
his
plan
of
course
the
amnesty
was
a
bomb
which
i
as
his
dupe
was
to
have
worn
during
my
search
for
the
boys
baxter
knowing
that
i
find
them
and
the
ancients
with
them
had
suggested
that
i
wear
that
blouse
so
that
he
could
trail
me
into
their
lair
then
the
flick
of
a
switch
and
jery
delvin
would
be
blasted
to
shreds
while
the
martians
found
themselves
stranded
forever
in
immovable
location
and
yet
i
was
still
puzzled
how
could
he
have
known
that
i
find
them
i
decided
not
to
vaporize
him
just
yet
i
had
a
few
points
to
clear
up
or
go
out
of
my
mind
wondering
about
for
the
rest
of
my
days
i
unholstered
the
collapser
slid
the
window
open
with
one
hand
and
swung
my
legs
over
the
sill
good
evening
gentlemen
i
said
they
did
seem
very
glad
to
see
me
charlie
and
foster
stood
stiffly
before
the
desk
watching
me
warily
as
i
completed
my
clamber
into
the
room
their
eyes
widened
a
fraction
as
clatclit
sprang
lightly
in
after
me
but
that
was
all
baxter
however
had
lifted
one
eyebrow
and
was
appraising
me
carefully
as
if
trying
to
gauge
the
intensity
of
my
emotions
no
one
said
a
word
for
a
minute
while
clatclit
shut
the
window
and
came
to
stand
a
bit
behind
me
to
my
right
leaving
the
show
to
me
baxter
found
his
voice
first
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
the
casual
friendly
tone
he
used
at
our
first
meeting
his
inflection
giving
no
sign
that
i
had
him
covered
by
the
most
deadly
weapon
in
the
solar
system
since
i
am
still
alive
he
said
dryly
i
can
only
assume
that
you
want
to
see
me
about
something
before
i
die
else
you
would
have
blasted
me
through
that
window
that
very
accurate
i
said
grimly
if
you
tell
your
men
to
be
seated
and
to
keep
their
hands
where
i
can
watch
them
i
lower
this
barrel
a
bit
i
would
want
an
accidental
finger
twitch
to
terminate
our
conversation
charlie
and
foster
looked
at
baxter
he
gave
a
curt
nod
and
they
sat
down
i
stayed
back
from
the
desk
keeping
my
back
against
the
wall
beside
clatclit
i
did
want
anyone
else
coming
in
and
sneaking
up
behind
me
baxter
swung
slightly
about
in
his
chair
to
face
me
then
laced
his
fingers
on
his
knees
now
that
we
settled
he
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
mister
delvin
baxter
i
said
i
just
came
from
seeing
one
of
the
ancients
he
and
i
had
a
long
talk
baxter
never
flickered
an
eyelash
he
just
nodded
and
waited
politely
for
me
to
continue
it
seems
you
are
a
menace
to
them
they
stand
in
the
way
of
your
ambition
and
must
be
destroyed
however
the
ancients
even
with
their
extra
dimension
do
seem
to
have
any
increase
in
brain
power
their
evaluation
of
your
intentions
is
without
doubt
the
correct
one
but
as
to
their
interpretation
of
your
motives
they
full
of
hot
air
a
slight
smile
of
grudging
approval
appeared
on
his
round
face
very
good
mister
delvin
well
thought
out
tell
me
just
what
do
they
think
i
after
according
to
them
you
want
to
be
the
visible
kingpin
of
the
civilizations
instead
of
just
running
things
from
behind
the
scenes
for
a
while
i
thought
it
made
sense
too
but
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
this
of
our
worlds
is
just
the
sort
of
position
that
would
appeal
to
you
baxter
you
enjoy
being
the
secret
master
of
venus
earth
and
mars
i
could
imagine
you
chuckling
to
yourself
delighting
in
being
an
apparent
public
servant
and
saying
to
yourself
fools
if
they
only
knew
am
i
right
baxter
smile
grew
broader
in
substance
yes
i
do
rather
like
being
the
kingpin
incognito
as
it
were
but
go
on
you
were
about
to
make
a
point
well
if
that
were
the
case
then
the
ancients
would
have
to
be
destroyed
sent
back
to
their
dimension
forever
you
be
suited
by
the
status
quo
alien
beings
on
mars
would
just
be
alien
beings
on
a
mars
which
you
still
controlled
so
there
got
to
be
something
more
that
you
want
you
have
all
the
power
i
know
of
right
now
so
there
can
be
only
one
thing
left
for
you
to
want
some
power
i
do
know
of
i
must
congratulate
you
on
your
perspicacity
he
said
yes
there
is
something
more
mister
delvin
that
much
i
will
tell
you
but
as
to
what
it
is
he
spread
his
hands
i
do
see
that
it
your
concern
you
i
said
then
paused
his
insouciance
was
not
in
keeping
with
his
situation
therefore
the
situation
was
not
the
one
which
i
thought
it
was
you
pretty
chipper
i
said
for
a
man
held
at
oh
am
i
being
chipper
he
said
all
raised
eyebrows
and
facetious
wonder
i
had
noticed
you
fool
i
said
softly
baxter
amiable
smile
vanished
and
a
hard
light
came
into
his
eyes
what
do
you
mean
he
said
through
clenched
teeth
i
mean
i
said
gently
but
with
deadly
earnest
that
the
brain
back
on
earth
selected
me
because
of
my
mental
abilities
i
mean
baxter
that
i
can
figure
things
out
faster
than
you
can
dream
them
up
the
brain
picked
you
he
said
coldly
because
it
was
rigged
by
the
ancients
and
for
no
other
reason
i
nodded
and
the
ancients
rigged
it
to
pick
the
man
most
likely
to
succeed
in
your
destruction
baxter
was
suddenly
silent
he
watched
me
intently
i
lounged
against
the
wall
waving
the
muzzle
of
the
collapser
up
and
down
slowly
let
me
clue
you
in
to
my
reasoning
baxter
old
man
i
grinned
this
is
a
collapser
it
is
in
working
order
you
do
not
fear
it
ergo
you
have
some
protection
from
it
i
would
deduce
that
you
are
at
present
wearing
a
shield
of
some
sort
a
shield
which
you
have
kept
secret
from
everyone
but
yourself
and
the
inventor
who
is
probably
long
since
dead
if
i
know
your
approach
to
things
charlie
and
foster
turned
and
looked
at
him
their
eyes
bugging
out
in
surprise
till
that
moment
they
thought
their
weapon
invincible
against
anything
you
astound
me
baxter
said
admiringly
but
there
something
you
do
know
about
the
shield
it
protects
not
by
but
by
i
could
have
gotten
that
part
figured
out
too
if
i
just
allowed
my
mind
to
wander
a
bit
through
the
paths
yours
seems
to
prefer
nice
work
not
only
are
you
protected
but
your
assailant
is
himself
destroyed
and
so
mister
delvin
baxter
smiled
starting
to
get
up
from
his
chair
to
come
and
disarm
me
and
so
i
said
nothing
baxter
stopped
on
hearing
the
easy
confidence
of
my
voice
he
hesitated
looked
at
me
you
should
have
kept
it
a
secret
i
said
smiling
charlie
and
foster
here
are
therefore
quite
vulnerable
to
the
ray
it
was
rewarding
to
see
their
increased
pallor
so
you
guys
i
addressed
them
unless
you
want
to
go
out
in
a
blaze
of
blue
sparks
how
about
tying
this
silly
old
man
to
his
chair
they
faltered
only
the
fraction
of
an
instant
and
then
they
had
a
furious
cursing
baxter
neatly
hooked
at
ankles
and
wrists
to
his
chair
with
their
all
right
baxter
growled
deep
in
his
throat
when
they
had
been
back
to
their
places
you
are
clever
delvin
so
what
happens
now
do
you
beat
me
to
death
with
your
fists
or
what
if
necessary
i
said
a
brief
flicker
of
fear
went
across
his
face
but
so
far
as
i
concerned
destroying
you
need
not
mean
physical
dissolution
i
do
care
so
much
about
baxter
the
man
as
i
do
about
baxter
the
kingpin
to
keep
my
end
of
the
bargain
i
can
simply
report
what
i
know
to
the
world
congress
and
have
you
stashed
away
where
you
can
never
carry
out
any
of
your
totalitarian
schemes
the
normal
ruddiness
of
baxter
face
was
superseded
by
a
sickly
gray
you
ca
he
said
then
stopped
at
the
moment
it
was
quite
apparent
that
i
could
and
as
for
your
big
secret
power
i
said
calmly
and
without
boasting
it
took
me
about
two
seconds
brainwork
to
guess
what
it
is
baxter
just
sat
and
smoldered
his
mouth
clamped
shut
the
ancients
i
said
live
in
location
with
a
capital
already
experienced
a
demonstration
of
their
logistic
powers
they
had
me
bobbing
around
like
a
balloon
down
in
their
weird
little
cavern
and
they
were
also
able
not
so
long
ago
to
manipulate
the
workings
of
the
international
cybernetics
brain
across
a
void
millions
of
miles
wide
that
by
me
shows
one
power
which
any
dictator
would
give
a
hell
of
a
lot
to
get
ahold
of
teleportation
baxter
stared
at
me
in
furious
amazement
but
i
went
on
there
seemed
to
be
a
couple
of
details
which
jibe
if
that
were
the
case
if
they
could
manage
control
over
cosmic
distances
so
easily
why
should
they
go
to
the
trouble
of
getting
a
man
me
to
bump
you
off
why
not
simply
teleport
you
into
something
fatal
that
would
be
the
easier
method
but
they
did
do
it
therefore
for
some
reason
they
could
well
then
jery
i
thought
to
myself
what
could
the
reason
be
in
their
dimension
that
of
ultimate
place
or
location
distances
have
no
meanings
everything
in
creation
is
here
so
what
held
them
up
what
kept
them
from
snatching
you
obviously
only
one
thing
could
baxter
the
parabolite
he
kept
his
features
rigid
but
sweat
was
beading
his
brow
it
gleamed
like
diamonds
in
the
lamplight
it
seems
that
the
ancients
can
only
control
areas
where
their
is
present
until
the
mineral
was
found
by
earth
scientists
that
place
was
on
mars
only
then
some
of
the
material
was
taken
back
to
earth
for
museums
for
analysis
and
even
for
paperweights
and
such
my
guess
is
that
one
of
the
technicians
who
runs
the
brain
has
a
hunk
of
the
stuff
on
his
desk
right
baxter
narrowed
his
eyes
then
relaxed
and
nodded
yes
as
soon
as
i
figured
out
the
brain
had
been
gimmicked
i
went
there
to
check
i
had
it
removed
immediately
then
i
refed
the
data
into
the
brain
and
found
the
name
of
the
man
who
should
have
been
sent
here
to
destroy
the
ancients
i
nodded
your
own
philip
baxter
which
is
why
you
sped
up
here
so
damned
fast
after
i
arrived
and
also
why
you
had
to
toss
me
into
a
cell
one
thing
eludes
me
though
what
gave
you
the
hint
that
the
brain
might
have
been
rigged
baxter
smiled
wearily
your
loss
of
the
amnesty
when
these
idiots
here
called
me
my
first
reaction
was
to
chew
them
out
and
to
have
you
released
it
was
only
after
talking
to
you
that
it
dawned
on
me
that
you
seemed
for
the
task
i
had
in
mind
i
got
to
wondering
about
the
brain
then
that
when
i
went
over
to
see
for
myself
and
found
the
parabolite
i
nodded
again
yes
in
their
cavernful
of
the
stuff
they
could
float
me
all
over
the
place
when
some
of
the
stuff
was
near
the
brain
they
could
control
that
but
nothing
else
nothing
that
was
not
in
the
presence
of
the
mineral
that
is
excepting
one
part
of
the
mineral
the
chunk
that
comprises
the
false
amnesty
something
had
to
happen
to
that
hunk
of
it
something
that
simultaneously
rendered
that
piece
out
of
their
control
and
told
them
that
you
were
a
menace
to
their
existence
in
this
dimension
if
you
think
i
tell
you
that
he
said
angrily
no
need
to
i
figured
out
that
one
too
when
i
first
figured
out
just
what
parabolite
was
i
compared
it
to
a
rubber
ball
on
an
elastic
cord
trying
to
destroy
it
by
force
was
impossible
it
just
bounced
and
swung
into
the
cushion
of
its
fourth
dimension
but
sticking
with
the
analogue
what
happens
if
the
rubber
ball
is
attacked
from
all
sides
simultaneously
it
has
nowhere
to
go
then
and
i
asked
myself
what
could
attack
parabolite
from
even
its
extra
dimension
what
except
another
piece
of
parabolite
oh
not
in
the
frictive
way
like
diamond
cutting
diamond
you
still
controlled
only
three
of
the
dimensions
using
that
method
and
it
had
been
tried
already
by
scientists
and
found
useless
so
you
had
to
attack
it
on
the
level
since
the
three
forms
of
matter
solid
liquid
and
gas
all
must
exist
with
height
breadth
and
depth
you
had
to
use
the
only
thing
in
our
universe
that
we
have
besides
matter
energy
fire
no
heat
had
been
tried
already
atomic
dissolution
a
bit
better
perhaps
a
battery
of
collapsers
working
on
the
subatomic
level
had
managed
to
destroy
a
fraction
of
a
gram
of
the
stuff
simply
from
the
laws
of
encounters
with
parabolite
molecules
in
the
fourth
dimension
a
ray
as
powerful
as
the
undoubtedly
accidentally
gets
generated
in
an
extra
dimension
but
only
in
the
most
minor
way
not
nearly
enough
for
your
purpose
and
what
baxter
asked
between
tautened
lips
is
my
purpose
since
your
dream
necessitates
the
ability
to
teleport
your
agents
wherever
you
please
you
must
have
parabolite
wherever
you
please
this
in
turn
necessitates
pulverizing
the
mineral
down
to
its
very
molecules
and
sowing
it
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
three
planets
then
you
will
be
free
to
take
complete
command
the
hitch
of
course
is
that
the
pulverization
of
parabolite
would
engender
as
the
ancient
put
it
a
jolt
a
jolt
which
would
unlatch
location
from
our
dimension
sending
the
ancients
off
forever
they
did
like
the
idea
and
so
they
set
out
to
destroy
you
baxter
jaw
during
the
last
part
of
my
narrative
had
gone
slack
and
he
stared
at
me
idiotically
i
had
to
grin
yes
i
know
what
suffering
you
going
through
at
this
moment
baxter
old
boy
for
nothing
you
telling
yourself
if
you
had
only
known
huh
you
you
mean
he
licked
his
dry
lips
and
stared
at
me
horribly
upset
that
all
i
had
to
do
to
be
rid
of
the
ancients
was
to
go
ahead
with
my
scheme
simply
pulverizing
a
hunk
of
that
stuff
would
have
sent
them
off
i
nodded
ironically
yes
no
need
to
rig
a
bomb
to
send
me
seeking
them
to
try
and
set
this
bomb
off
in
their
midst
you
could
have
set
it
off
right
back
on
earth
and
been
just
as
rid
of
them
no
need
he
repeated
dully
then
suddenly
alert
set
it
off
how
did
you
know
it
was
the
only
form
of
energy
that
had
been
tried
i
said
with
a
shrug
back
on
earth
you
ran
that
disc
of
parabolite
through
a
hot
atomic
pile
and
it
became
intensely
radioactive
since
the
deadly
emanations
of
the
pile
are
even
less
than
subatomic
and
have
no
dimensions
then
a
shielding
coating
of
nullifying
gamma
plasm
the
same
stuff
we
use
to
keep
our
rocket
chambers
from
dosing
the
passengers
with
deadly
rays
and
neat
nickel
plate
over
that
emboss
it
with
the
seal
of
the
world
president
lacquer
it
in
the
colors
of
is
and
you
have
a
neat
but
incredibly
potent
little
fission
bomb
and
how
could
i
set
this
off
baxter
sneered
are
you
forgetting
that
the
parabolite
at
less
than
a
critical
mass
same
way
the
old
worked
i
said
under
the
gamma
plasm
beside
the
radioactive
parabolite
you
have
an
atomic
bullet
the
kind
the
foot
soldiers
used
in
the
third
world
war
as
for
tracking
it
and
detonating
it
you
must
have
a
refinement
of
the
tracking
stuff
you
had
in
that
blouse
of
mine
as
the
old
was
triggered
by
an
atomic
bomb
so
the
parabolite
even
at
less
than
critical
mass
could
be
triggered
by
the
atomic
bullet
you
planned
to
blow
up
the
ancients
and
me
with
them
baxter
then
you
could
go
ahead
and
set
off
similar
bombs
one
each
on
venus
earth
and
mars
the
fallout
would
stay
with
the
planets
forever
even
after
losing
its
potency
and
you
could
teleport
your
agents
anywhere
you
chose
and
the
ancients
said
baxter
they
reasoned
out
your
intentions
when
you
made
that
chunk
of
parabolite
radioactive
why
do
that
unless
you
intended
detonating
it
but
the
very
act
of
making
it
fissionable
somehow
took
the
out
of
it
they
could
use
it
to
snatch
you
even
when
you
were
near
it
probably
since
it
seems
the
only
likely
reason
they
could
use
it
because
it
was
too
atomically
hot
for
them
to
work
with
i
was
finished
i
waited
mister
delvin
said
baxter
after
a
long
moment
what
do
you
intend
to
do
now
keep
you
in
cuffs
i
said
send
an
emergency
call
to
the
world
congress
see
you
corked
into
one
of
your
own
granite
cells
with
the
air
supply
turned
on
however
though
i
would
mind
you
having
an
hour
or
two
of
what
i
went
through
the
other
night
and
baxter
turned
his
head
and
nodded
toward
the
handbag
on
the
desk
what
about
her
she
was
being
held
conditional
to
my
removing
you
as
a
menace
i
said
consider
yourself
removed
baxter
smiled
and
if
the
ancients
are
not
satisfied
what
if
they
still
desire
my
death
not
simply
my
imprisonment
i
thought
it
over
in
that
case
i
be
forced
to
comply
with
their
wishes
to
his
credit
this
unexpected
statement
on
my
part
only
stopped
his
tongue
for
a
moment
he
immediately
tried
a
new
approach
and
if
the
ancients
decide
to
destroy
her
anyhow
why
should
they
i
said
less
sure
of
myself
he
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
watching
me
no
he
shook
his
head
now
i
think
of
it
they
would
destroy
her
they
hold
her
captivity
over
your
head
forcing
you
to
return
so
that
they
might
destroy
you
me
i
said
startled
surely
you
can
see
why
he
went
on
smoothly
after
all
why
were
they
out
to
destroy
me
mister
delvin
because
you
knew
i
said
then
halted
how
to
destroy
them
baxter
finished
for
me
the
selfsame
information
which
you
now
possess
what
do
you
think
your
chances
are
for
survival
now
my
guard
wavered
in
that
fleeting
moment
of
realization
i
caught
the
flicker
of
movement
just
a
second
too
late
charlie
out
of
my
thoughts
for
an
instant
had
whipped
his
collapser
out
of
his
holster
and
brought
it
to
bear
on
me
but
even
before
i
could
bring
my
own
weapon
up
in
a
futile
attempt
at
a
duel
which
would
have
resulted
in
probably
two
fatalities
claws
gripped
my
shoulder
and
i
was
carried
hurtling
to
the
floor
by
clatclit
full
weight
on
my
back
to
the
floor
just
behind
chair
charlie
spinning
about
to
keep
me
in
range
touched
the
trigger
there
was
a
shriek
a
shriek
that
died
the
split
second
in
which
it
was
born
and
then
my
world
disappeared
in
a
blinding
shower
of
sparks
when
clatclit
and
i
got
up
again
charlie
and
foster
were
missing
along
with
most
of
the
corridor
wall
baxter
was
just
standing
up
from
the
remnants
of
his
chair
the
manacles
at
his
wrists
and
ankles
having
been
dissolved
by
the
bolt
which
could
not
destroy
him
the
bolt
had
rebounded
from
his
shielding
force
to
destroy
its
perpetrator
charlie
and
foster
the
hapless
bystander
before
i
could
toss
aside
my
useless
weapon
and
attack
him
barehanded
baxter
had
yanked
up
another
weapon
from
the
floor
it
was
one
of
the
water
guns
its
flexible
hose
running
back
to
tanks
filled
with
gallons
of
fluid
if
you
place
any
value
on
the
existence
of
this
creature
who
has
just
saved
your
life
delvin
you
will
hand
over
that
weapon
to
me
at
once
clatclit
looked
at
me
i
sighed
and
tossed
the
collapser
to
baxter
what
the
hell
it
would
work
on
him
anyhow
and
now
said
baxter
dropping
the
water
weapon
and
covering
us
with
the
one
which
was
deadly
to
both
our
hides
i
am
going
to
need
your
help
well
this
is
a
switch
i
remarked
the
kingpin
needs
a
hand
it
is
a
comedown
baxter
said
wryly
but
you
see
my
late
fatal
heroics
have
had
a
distressing
side
effect
oh
i
said
looking
about
the
shards
of
room
that
were
still
extant
on
the
corridor
side
i
do
see
anything
that
baxter
remarked
is
precisely
the
point
mister
delvin
a
moment
or
two
ago
not
three
yards
to
the
left
of
where
those
fools
were
sitting
no
do
bother
looking
there
only
empty
space
there
now
there
was
a
small
sending
set
i
brought
it
all
the
way
from
earth
with
me
in
fact
that
is
the
reason
i
was
sitting
in
this
room
tonight
had
my
agents
reported
to
my
satisfaction
that
you
were
present
among
the
ancients
i
should
have
used
that
set
to
detonate
the
atomic
bullet
in
the
false
amnesty
however
your
trigger
went
i
finished
need
i
say
i
am
elated
i
take
it
the
woman
the
one
wearing
the
false
amnesty
means
something
to
you
baxter
said
the
ancients
seemed
to
set
some
store
in
her
captivity
coercive
power
over
you
she
does
i
admitted
which
is
why
i
happy
you
no
longer
possess
the
means
to
set
that
damned
thing
off
i
had
no
particular
love
for
the
ancients
but
i
did
much
like
the
thought
of
snow
being
blasted
into
radioactive
rubble
well
then
if
you
desire
to
save
her
you
and
your
friend
are
going
to
guide
me
down
to
that
cavern
where
they
dwell
and
footsteps
pounded
down
the
corridor
and
then
a
squad
of
armed
guards
came
into
view
they
saw
baxter
and
halted
and
their
leader
stepped
forward
sir
he
said
our
detectors
reported
a
collapser
being
his
gaze
forgetful
of
military
deportment
took
a
second
to
wander
over
the
more
truncated
sections
of
the
room
being
used
in
this
vicinity
congratulations
baxter
remarked
sarcastically
your
eyes
might
give
you
the
selfsame
information
corporal
one
has
been
used
i
have
the
situation
in
hand
however
you
may
take
your
men
and
go
yes
sir
the
young
man
said
obviously
fighting
an
urge
to
break
protocol
and
ask
what
the
hell
happened
oh
and
corporal
baxter
said
as
the
boy
began
to
organize
his
squad
sir
you
might
scratch
myers
and
gibson
off
the
payroll
list
send
their
families
the
usual
telegrams
of
condolence
the
corporal
eyes
bugged
even
more
so
and
he
swallowed
noisily
before
mumbling
yes
sir
again
and
departing
that
was
pretty
callous
even
from
you
i
said
as
the
sounds
of
their
footsteps
dwindled
and
disappeared
not
callous
at
all
efficient
callous
baxter
shrugged
in
any
case
come
along
you
two
the
sooner
i
rid
myself
of
these
ancients
the
better
there
was
nothing
else
we
could
do
dejectedly
clatclit
began
moving
off
in
his
lumbering
lope
toward
the
staircase
i
followed
no
cheerier
than
he
baxter
brought
up
the
rear
so
far
as
i
could
see
in
selecting
me
as
the
tool
of
baxter
destruction
the
ancients
had
made
the
error
of
their
lives
then
almost
all
the
way
down
to
the
main
floor
i
heard
the
murmur
of
voices
we
were
nearing
the
terminal
lobby
the
point
where
passengers
were
checked
on
and
off
the
planet
as
we
turned
at
the
landing
i
saw
that
the
lobby
was
filled
with
a
throng
of
people
some
of
them
patiently
answering
questions
of
the
robots
others
having
baggage
weighed
and
still
others
engaging
pilots
and
technicians
in
casual
conversation
it
was
a
normal
enough
scene
one
to
be
found
in
any
rocket
terminal
on
earth
or
off
it
but
there
was
something
wrong
about
it
i
slowed
my
descent
of
the
stairs
and
tried
to
place
the
uncertainty
the
queasy
foreboding
i
felt
centering
about
my
heart
then
i
had
it
there
were
no
women
present
not
one
woman
could
i
see
in
that
apparently
casual
group
of
passengers
and
there
was
a
quiver
of
tingling
tension
in
the
air
a
very
palpable
sensation
of
mental
concentration
trembling
on
the
brink
of
action
baxter
sensed
it
too
i
could
feel
his
own
progress
slowing
behind
me
on
the
stairs
what
he
said
then
it
happened
at
the
far
end
of
the
immense
room
one
of
the
security
guards
let
out
a
cry
i
shot
my
gaze
toward
the
sound
and
saw
that
a
man
beside
him
had
yanked
his
collapser
from
his
holster
other
guards
came
alert
all
over
the
place
and
they
started
toward
the
man
on
a
run
and
they
were
all
of
them
neatly
tripped
shoved
and
clubbed
while
a
brilliant
crackle
of
free
electrons
sealed
the
fate
of
the
first
guard
the
revolution
was
starting
some
of
the
guards
managed
to
get
shots
off
before
they
were
overcome
by
weight
of
numbers
people
vanished
in
blinding
flares
of
energy
amid
shouts
of
fierce
rage
from
their
companions
there
one
someone
shouted
and
a
clump
of
these
desperate
insurgents
turned
toward
the
stairs
where
clatclit
and
i
stood
they
were
looking
past
us
at
baxter
then
the
security
chief
fired
the
collapser
in
his
hand
the
humming
bolt
of
buzzing
right
past
my
ear
but
he
had
fired
at
the
men
below
he
fired
directly
at
the
fluorescent
fixture
that
glowed
in
the
center
of
the
ceiling
suddenly
the
flash
that
marked
its
passage
was
the
only
lighting
in
that
room
then
the
cascade
of
sparks
died
and
we
were
standing
in
blackness
i
grabbed
clatclit
arm
hoping
we
could
make
a
break
for
freedom
in
the
dark
but
baxter
had
me
there
too
another
throbbing
beam
of
energy
from
behind
us
and
the
floor
was
gone
before
our
feet
leaving
a
dizzy
drop
into
emptiness
then
even
the
view
of
the
abyss
faded
as
the
sparks
of
energy
died
i
stifled
a
cry
of
alarm
in
my
throat
as
baxter
free
hand
flattened
itself
on
my
back
and
shoved
i
staggered
forward
and
my
foot
came
down
on
air
then
my
grip
on
clatclit
arm
throwing
him
off
balance
we
plunged
into
the
empty
space
somehow
writhing
in
midfall
clatclit
got
his
arms
about
me
and
he
took
the
brunt
of
the
landing
on
powerful
legs
and
tail
my
left
arm
was
numb
from
shoulder
to
elbow
i
must
have
struck
it
on
the
floor
of
the
room
below
the
lobby
when
we
landed
another
thump
told
me
that
baxter
had
arrived
too
he
did
better
than
we
did
after
all
he
was
expecting
a
fall
when
he
took
off
from
that
brink
in
another
moment
he
prodded
us
out
into
the
corridor
of
that
first
floor
under
ground
level
where
the
lights
were
still
working
then
taking
a
step
back
he
blasted
away
the
flooring
of
that
room
too
to
discourage
anyone
from
following
the
way
come
incongruously
as
he
came
back
out
he
shut
the
door
afraid
they
grab
at
the
knob
on
the
way
down
i
said
rubbing
my
injured
arm
neatness
said
baxter
not
to
be
outdone
is
a
virtue
come
on
come
on
baxter
said
impatiently
waving
the
muzzle
of
the
collapser
at
us
can
we
get
to
the
labyrinth
from
here
why
bother
now
i
said
jerking
a
thumb
toward
the
lobby
above
us
way
things
look
you
wo
have
any
empire
to
come
back
to
even
if
you
do
knock
off
the
ancients
a
minor
skirmish
like
this
can
not
but
fail
in
its
purpose
said
baxter
on
my
return
i
fully
expect
to
see
the
sky
filled
with
security
ships
from
earth
leisurely
razing
the
entire
city
wo
that
be
rather
difficult
to
write
off
as
even
the
way
you
keep
inventory
i
needled
move
said
baxter
beyond
patience
clatclit
and
i
moved
we
went
back
down
the
long
ramp
that
led
toward
the
dungeons
at
gunpoint
or
not
i
called
back
over
my
shoulder
by
the
way
just
what
do
you
intend
doing
when
we
arrive
at
the
castle
i
should
think
that
it
was
the
last
place
you
want
to
be
found
kind
of
like
telling
off
a
lion
while
your
head
in
his
mouth
far
off
behind
us
there
was
a
growing
shout
of
voices
apparently
the
rebels
had
managed
to
negotiate
what
was
left
of
the
stairway
and
were
hot
on
our
trail
faster
said
baxter
quite
unnecessarily
i
was
in
no
mood
to
test
whether
or
not
the
rebels
checked
one
ideology
before
blasting
away
a
disintegrated
bystander
is
beyond
apology
so
we
went
faster
we
reached
the
dungeon
level
and
clatclit
proceeded
to
shove
open
that
movable
section
of
wall
baxter
raised
his
eyebrows
in
surprise
but
then
simply
us
through
the
gap
we
went
and
he
followed
a
moment
later
i
watched
with
amusement
as
he
tried
vainly
to
shove
that
granite
mass
back
into
place
i
do
know
exactly
what
sugarfeet
use
for
muscles
but
it
beats
what
we
got
angrily
baxter
stepped
back
against
the
curved
wall
of
the
tunnel
and
said
you
move
that
back
we
do
want
them
following
us
in
here
clatclit
moved
over
to
obey
while
i
remarked
why
not
maybe
get
lost
it
save
your
ships
a
little
baxter
ignored
my
statement
and
simply
waited
until
clatclit
had
moved
back
beside
me
his
taillight
going
on
pyrotechnically
as
the
moving
granite
cut
us
off
from
the
light
in
the
dungeon
corridor
then
we
were
once
again
moving
down
that
slope
toward
the
deeply
hidden
lair
of
the
ancients
as
we
moved
along
side
by
side
with
baxter
coming
relentlessly
after
us
clatclit
hands
started
working
furiously
he
flicked
an
index
finger
toward
me
then
toward
himself
then
he
put
the
heels
of
his
hands
together
and
after
a
brief
waggling
of
the
fingertips
clamped
his
hands
into
fists
and
made
that
serpentine
forward
jab
with
one
hand
he
was
asking
in
his
pantomimic
way
if
he
and
i
under
cover
of
sudden
blinkout
of
his
taillight
might
scoot
off
into
the
labyrinth
and
escape
baxter
i
held
up
a
forefinger
and
waggled
it
left
and
right
in
a
signal
of
better
not
chum
he
put
his
palms
up
fingers
flipping
open
in
a
mute
why
not
i
curled
the
fingers
of
my
right
hand
into
the
palm
then
pointed
the
index
finger
forward
and
lifted
my
thumb
up
an
antique
earth
gesture
dating
back
to
the
times
when
hand
guns
had
fanning
hammers
on
them
i
spun
the
muzzle
of
this
simulated
weapon
up
down
and
every
which
way
to
indicate
to
clatclit
that
baxter
might
manage
through
sheer
blind
blasting
to
polish
us
off
before
we
got
very
far
clatclit
slammed
his
right
fist
into
his
left
palm
in
a
furious
symbol
of
an
exasperated
damn
what
are
you
two
plotting
up
there
baxter
demanded
suddenly
we
were
discussing
the
futility
of
a
scurry
for
cover
since
that
weapon
of
yours
would
slice
right
through
these
tunnels
i
said
deciding
the
truth
was
the
best
way
to
avoid
suspicious
repercussions
if
your
bolt
did
get
us
the
falling
ceiling
might
i
glad
you
using
your
intelligence
delvin
baxter
answered
then
why
are
we
stopping
because
i
said
halting
where
clatclit
had
suddenly
paused
in
his
forward
motion
that
thunder
you
hear
is
the
reason
the
ancients
never
find
themselves
in
the
sugarfeet
an
impassable
river
is
up
ahead
impassable
baxter
scowled
not
for
us
but
for
clatclit
here
i
said
he
ca
even
go
around
this
corner
without
risking
deadly
corrosion
and
in
case
you
notice
back
in
your
office
he
had
a
pretty
nasty
exposure
already
nevertheless
said
baxter
i
must
insist
that
he
either
accompany
us
or
be
destroyed
right
here
what
i
said
appalled
you
ca
ask
him
to
do
that
he
last
any
longer
than
you
would
in
boiling
oil
i
certainly
do
not
intend
to
leave
him
here
baxter
snapped
he
might
alert
others
of
his
kind
and
and
what
i
growled
you
could
fend
off
a
million
of
them
with
that
weapon
of
yours
and
risk
the
ceiling
falling
in
on
my
head
baxter
said
no
delvin
i
not
about
to
take
that
chance
and
just
how
i
said
savagely
did
that
peanut
brain
of
yours
plan
on
your
getting
out
of
here
without
him
baxter
paused
his
gun
hand
wavering
because
if
he
melts
in
the
river
or
is
vaporized
right
here
and
now
you
will
be
stuck
without
a
light
stuck
in
a
maze
that
you
could
negotiate
alone
if
you
had
a
light
baxter
just
stared
thinking
furiously
of
course
i
went
on
you
could
simply
aim
that
thing
upward
and
disintegrate
your
way
out
but
that
too
might
make
the
ceiling
fall
in
and
if
it
did
you
have
the
small
difficulty
of
climbing
the
well
you
created
climbing
by
the
way
into
the
martian
desert
where
there
is
no
air
no
water
and
very
little
heat
you
be
dessicated
suffocated
and
a
popsicle
to
boot
i
i
could
very
easily
slant
the
bolt
into
marsport
baxter
blustered
i
could
climb
the
slope
easily
enough
and
there
be
fresh
air
waiting
for
me
too
yeah
i
mocked
folding
my
arms
fresh
air
and
a
city
full
of
insurgent
assuming
of
course
that
you
did
strike
an
underground
stream
in
the
process
and
get
washed
away
into
the
depths
of
the
planet
when
your
stance
with
the
collapser
tired
you
out
when
you
completely
dissipated
the
charge
i
baxter
said
desperately
nervous
and
also
assuming
i
continued
that
you
know
in
which
direction
marsport
is
chum
of
course
you
could
swing
that
thing
in
a
full
circle
of
toward
the
surface
but
then
that
would
make
the
ceiling
fall
in
would
it
once
you
cut
away
all
supports
baxter
trembled
with
impotent
rage
but
his
gun
muzzle
was
finally
slumped
all
the
way
toward
the
floor
of
the
tunnel
he
was
beaten
and
he
knew
it
and
that
when
i
jumped
him
my
right
arm
shot
down
and
gripped
his
right
wrist
a
very
awkward
stance
to
take
but
my
left
arm
was
still
weak
and
useless
from
my
fall
but
clatclit
moved
in
then
his
rocky
talons
sinking
like
so
many
fangs
into
baxter
right
arm
all
three
of
us
a
writhing
tangle
on
the
tunnel
floor
each
of
us
frantically
aware
that
the
gun
had
better
not
emit
any
bolts
while
an
arm
leg
or
tail
flailed
in
front
of
it
baxter
shrieked
with
fear
and
rage
as
those
steely
fingers
took
hold
i
think
he
was
too
upset
otherwise
to
feel
the
pain
and
then
a
bolt
buzzed
blindingly
into
the
tunnel
and
as
we
all
three
flattened
ourselves
and
waited
for
the
ceiling
to
come
crashing
down
it
spattered
into
nothingness
against
the
wall
we
sat
up
staring
at
the
spot
where
the
invincible
bolt
had
simply
been
dissipated
all
of
us
looking
pretty
silly
flat
on
our
bottoms
leaning
back
on
our
hands
on
that
curved
stone
surface
momentarily
losing
sight
of
our
belligerent
behavior
of
a
moment
before
the
wall
i
said
first
to
realize
the
significance
but
i
go
on
baxter
finished
for
me
it
parabolite
he
cried
then
my
eyes
were
dazzled
by
the
blaze
of
light
that
suddenly
materialized
all
around
us
and
my
stomach
turned
over
sickeningly
as
i
realized
that
the
converse
was
probably
true
we
had
just
materialized
inside
the
dazzling
light
we
were
all
three
of
us
within
the
chamber
of
the
ancient
martians
well
done
jery
delvin
said
a
familiar
voice
and
then
the
light
before
us
trembled
and
warped
and
i
was
looking
into
the
disconcerting
triple
face
of
the
ancient
again
i
was
not
however
in
the
mood
for
compliments
where
is
my
woman
i
said
peremptorily
on
your
departure
she
expressed
a
desire
to
inquire
further
into
the
health
of
her
sibling
said
the
martian
she
is
even
now
with
him
and
his
companions
in
that
cage
i
cried
angrily
i
assure
you
she
is
kindly
forego
the
lecture
on
metabolic
stasis
and
raise
the
damned
thing
will
you
i
interrupted
the
martian
warped
and
sparkled
in
a
dizzying
movement
that
i
could
only
interpret
as
a
shrug
and
then
the
huge
parabolite
cage
came
rising
up
from
that
flooring
jery
snow
baby
we
clung
to
each
other
awkwardly
and
our
lips
met
between
the
columnar
bars
i
pulled
back
and
called
ca
you
open
this
thing
up
now
your
mission
is
not
quite
accomplished
jery
delvin
said
the
martian
the
man
philip
baxter
is
within
our
realm
but
as
yet
undestroyed
you
mean
i
still
got
to
as
told
you
repeatedly
physical
contact
between
our
races
is
impossible
jery
delvin
hey
what
about
that
i
said
after
i
left
here
i
got
to
wondering
how
if
what
you
just
said
is
true
you
people
were
able
to
manipulate
the
brain
to
select
me
the
brain
of
which
you
speak
works
on
a
principle
of
generated
by
induction
coils
we
simply
placed
the
right
counterforces
in
the
right
places
no
actual
contact
was
necessary
well
damn
it
i
said
after
a
glance
back
at
baxter
and
clatclit
who
were
staring
bewilderedly
toward
the
source
of
the
voice
you
just
keep
him
here
he
bound
to
perish
from
lack
of
food
or
water
or
jery
delvin
the
metabolic
stasis
which
i
have
already
mentioned
to
you
is
not
something
we
used
specially
for
these
boys
it
is
a
necessary
contingent
of
our
world
where
there
is
absolute
location
there
is
absolutely
no
change
of
the
sort
you
mentioned
i
gave
up
all
right
all
right
i
wo
argue
the
point
if
you
could
get
at
him
i
guess
you
would
not
a
chance
of
dropping
him
down
a
hole
or
something
though
by
the
very
nature
of
our
world
hazardous
localizing
is
an
impossibility
our
universe
possesses
a
that
obviates
the
contingency
of
perilous
placement
of
an
individual
their
universe
has
what
snow
asked
me
her
eyes
wide
a
safety
feature
i
muttered
it
figures
now
that
i
think
of
it
if
location
is
absolute
it
is
one
that
means
that
it
either
or
it
ca
have
a
bit
of
one
thing
and
a
bit
another
which
means
that
i
still
carrying
the
ball
correction
said
baxter
behind
me
you
have
fumbled
i
looked
back
at
him
he
had
the
collapser
in
his
hand
yet
despite
our
materialization
in
the
cavern
and
the
muzzle
was
pointed
right
at
snow
breast
at
the
amnesty
jery
she
cried
hanging
onto
my
arm
baxter
i
yelled
stepping
in
front
of
her
and
flattening
myself
against
the
bars
give
us
a
chance
if
that
damned
thing
triggers
the
parabolite
you
go
with
us
how
little
you
know
delvin
baxter
smiled
there
are
any
number
of
features
of
this
other
dimension
which
even
your
fantastic
intellect
has
not
guessed
did
it
never
occur
to
you
to
wonder
just
where
learned
the
construction
of
a
teleportation
machine
i
i
assumed
you
learned
it
somehow
from
the
ancients
i
said
before
they
realized
you
intended
their
destruction
i
take
my
hat
off
to
you
said
baxter
with
a
slight
nod
of
grudging
admiration
i
did
realize
you
thought
things
out
quite
that
far
hell
it
was
the
only
way
you
could
have
learned
i
said
but
it
got
to
do
with
with
the
baxter
said
smiling
why
only
everything
you
see
delvin
teleported
matter
in
order
to
bypass
distance
must
travel
in
the
place
where
there
is
no
distance
the
fourth
dimension
and
so
the
brunt
of
the
blast
will
be
absorbed
by
the
ancients
not
by
me
i
heard
the
martian
gasp
apparently
they
were
aware
of
this
fact
it
was
more
than
just
displacement
they
faced
it
was
death
your
agents
i
temporized
they
then
be
using
a
system
that
transported
them
via
radioactive
chaos
baxter
shook
his
head
since
the
transfer
is
an
instantaneous
one
i
rather
doubt
that
they
absorb
any
roentgens
to
speak
of
that
seemed
to
be
that
he
was
set
to
fire
and
i
was
all
out
of
arguments
and
my
stance
between
snow
and
that
was
only
a
fleeting
protection
she
go
about
one
second
after
i
did
then
behind
me
in
the
cage
i
heard
a
movement
and
snow
gave
a
little
cry
i
jerked
my
head
about
ted
with
more
sense
than
his
sister
had
simply
taken
the
amnesty
from
about
her
throat
and
flung
it
away
all
of
us
followed
its
flight
with
dazzled
eyes
baxter
swung
up
the
barrel
of
the
collapser
and
fired
and
in
the
same
instant
the
spinning
disc
halted
and
then
dodged
out
of
the
trajectory
of
the
bolt
the
martian
was
protecting
himself
in
the
only
way
he
could
changing
the
location
i
crouched
involuntarily
clutching
snow
hand
through
the
bars
as
the
contest
went
on
the
tiny
disc
of
destruction
flitted
here
there
and
everywhere
in
a
dizzying
erratic
course
while
baxter
kept
the
trigger
of
the
collapser
depressed
tightly
and
slashed
wildly
in
the
light
of
that
place
with
the
pulsing
beam
i
was
in
favor
of
the
ancients
exactly
but
i
was
bound
and
determined
to
halt
baxter
reckless
blasting
with
that
gun
one
flick
of
whose
ray
would
disintegrate
me
snow
or
clatclit
not
to
mention
the
frightened
huddle
of
small
boys
in
that
cage
and
there
was
one
way
to
halt
him
at
him
i
cried
to
the
martian
he
wo
fire
if
it
anywhere
near
himself
he
must
have
heard
me
the
disc
skidded
to
a
wobbly
halt
and
then
it
dove
like
an
eagle
toward
baxter
in
a
swift
graceful
line
a
straight
line
you
imbecile
i
yelled
an
instant
too
late
even
the
poorest
shot
can
track
an
object
moving
toward
or
away
from
him
baxter
collapser
caught
the
descending
disc
a
good
twenty
yards
before
it
got
to
him
my
eyes
clamped
shut
against
the
monstrous
blaze
of
heat
and
light
then
snow
hand
tightly
gripped
in
mine
i
was
enveloped
in
inky
blackness
with
nothing
but
empty
air
beneath
the
soles
of
my
boots
and
falling
snow
darling
are
you
all
right
i
asked
getting
groggily
to
my
feet
and
pressing
her
hand
between
both
of
mine
the
fall
had
been
as
bad
as
the
one
i
taken
earlier
through
that
hole
in
the
floor
but
it
was
enough
to
shake
me
up
i
think
so
jery
she
said
pressing
one
slim
hand
to
her
forehead
then
brushing
a
wisp
of
hair
back
out
of
her
eyes
i
took
her
tightly
in
my
arms
and
held
her
only
then
did
i
suddenly
realize
where
we
were
the
light
came
from
the
trylon
tip
of
clatclit
tail
it
reflected
in
a
red
glow
from
the
cavern
floor
but
vanished
over
our
heads
into
an
impenetrable
darkness
beyond
snow
i
saw
the
space
scouts
getting
to
their
feet
the
kids
were
in
much
better
shape
than
i
was
with
consistent
bad
luck
i
taken
the
fall
on
my
injured
left
arm
and
now
it
was
throbbing
like
crazy
ted
came
rushing
over
to
us
then
i
remembered
baxter
and
looked
swiftly
about
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
clatclit
i
shouted
my
crystalline
buddy
came
hurrying
over
to
me
his
little
taillight
bobbing
as
he
ran
his
glittering
eyes
looked
a
question
at
me
what
happened
to
baxter
i
said
clatclit
pointed
off
into
the
darkness
and
made
that
serpentine
movement
with
his
hand
into
the
labyrinth
i
exclaimed
but
why
clatclit
pointed
toward
the
floor
i
followed
his
gesture
with
my
eyes
and
saw
on
the
rocky
ground
the
reason
the
collapser
lay
there
its
firing
chamber
cracked
in
half
it
was
useless
as
a
coercion
any
more
unless
baxter
had
a
good
throwing
arm
but
why
did
you
follow
him
i
asked
disgusted
stare
clatclit
pointed
to
me
snow
and
then
the
boys
and
followed
with
an
tremor
of
his
tail
oh
yeah
we
would
have
trouble
getting
out
of
here
unguided
at
that
i
said
sheepishly
when
snow
was
around
i
could
even
see
the
obvious
any
chance
baxter
can
find
his
way
out
of
here
alone
i
said
if
he
gets
to
the
spaceport
before
we
do
he
may
get
back
to
earth
and
get
an
army
back
here
after
us
clatclit
thought
it
over
then
he
placed
an
arm
across
my
shoulders
and
an
arm
across
snow
and
looked
hopeful
damn
i
said
not
knowing
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
it
mighty
nice
of
you
to
offer
but
we
ca
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
down
here
with
you
clatclit
i
shook
my
head
we
got
to
get
out
of
here
and
get
the
word
to
the
world
congress
before
baxter
sews
the
earth
up
tight
say
ted
small
voice
interrupted
what
happened
to
the
bars
and
stuff
hey
i
blinked
startled
and
looked
about
us
then
on
an
impulse
i
dropped
to
my
knees
and
felt
the
ground
it
was
plain
old
lava
i
rocked
back
on
my
heels
bewildered
and
then
i
understood
and
started
laughing
jery
what
is
it
snow
baby
it
the
laugh
of
the
century
that
all
unstable
is
hardly
the
word
for
the
ancients
universe
not
only
did
they
dislocate
but
they
took
their
with
them
my
guess
is
that
right
now
there
is
no
longer
a
splinter
of
parabolite
in
the
solar
system
but
why
is
that
funny
she
asked
as
i
got
to
my
feet
again
because
honey
it
means
that
all
baxter
deep
dire
and
devious
schemes
have
come
to
naught
and
by
his
own
hand
at
that
he
never
build
his
teleportation
machine
now
his
what
she
said
you
see
baby
he
oh
hell
it
a
long
story
i
tell
you
when
we
have
more
time
right
now
we
have
to
head
baxter
off
or
things
be
very
funny
at
all
following
clatclit
light
snow
the
boys
and
i
moved
swiftly
across
the
floor
of
that
vast
cavern
emptied
of
its
metal
lining
and
occupants
after
heaven
knows
how
many
eons
of
existence
there
the
only
hitch
we
encountered
in
our
upward
race
was
that
torrent
which
clatclit
could
cross
without
dribbling
to
death
however
a
space
scout
is
true
brave
and
loyal
and
he
always
carries
a
rubber
poncho
inside
his
it
took
three
of
them
to
swaddle
our
guide
but
with
the
assistance
of
two
of
the
more
scouts
i
was
able
to
tote
him
bodily
across
that
perilous
bridge
with
nothing
showing
of
him
but
his
taillight
and
that
high
in
the
air
away
from
most
of
the
eroding
spray
once
unwrapped
he
took
the
lead
again
tail
high
then
snow
hand
tightly
in
mine
we
all
took
off
like
racers
up
those
winding
tunnels
of
mars
we
emerged
on
the
hillside
overlooking
the
airstrip
from
one
of
those
forbidden
to
enter
cave
mouths
in
the
bright
glow
of
the
towering
at
the
far
end
of
the
field
despite
political
intrigue
insurrection
and
the
disappearance
of
the
entire
martian
race
from
the
solar
system
it
stood
there
on
its
girder
legs
monotonously
separating
the
molecules
of
ferrous
oxide
into
molten
iron
and
atmosphere
things
seem
to
be
quiet
at
the
terminal
building
i
observed
looking
across
the
field
i
wonder
who
won
the
battle
what
battle
said
snow
boy
honey
i
kissed
her
lightly
on
the
forehead
you
are
going
to
take
years
to
bring
up
to
date
to
forestall
any
more
questions
i
turned
and
started
off
across
the
landing
field
with
my
group
tagging
cautiously
after
me
i
was
just
busy
wishing
i
still
had
my
collapser
when
from
a
cavemouth
to
our
right
a
pallid
glow
appeared
and
then
a
figure
darted
out
onto
the
strip
in
the
glow
of
the
terminal
lights
baxter
if
he
got
inside
first
and
is
men
were
in
charge
but
he
had
seen
me
yet
i
could
just
hope
for
a
rebel
win
i
took
off
like
an
olympic
sprinter
racing
toward
that
staggering
silhouette
before
me
my
hands
outstretched
in
the
hopes
of
throttling
him
a
bit
before
i
turned
him
over
to
the
world
congress
unless
of
course
the
rebels
ruled
marsport
and
then
one
of
the
more
excitable
space
scouts
blurted
an
involuntary
get
him
baxter
whirled
five
feet
away
from
my
fingertips
his
right
hand
came
swinging
up
toward
my
face
and
then
i
was
coughing
and
sneezing
and
waving
frantic
hands
at
a
blazing
something
that
engulfed
my
features
by
the
time
i
realized
it
was
only
and
at
the
same
moment
realized
how
baxter
had
lighted
his
way
out
he
was
on
his
way
into
the
terminal
his
old
legs
whipping
like
pistons
well
he
be
the
first
to
see
who
survived
the
battle
clatclit
and
the
others
had
caught
up
to
me
by
then
and
we
moved
in
a
desperate
bunch
toward
those
lighted
glass
doors
in
a
last
hope
of
getting
our
man
before
our
man
men
got
us
any
second
i
expected
a
cordon
of
armed
guards
to
come
galloping
out
of
there
with
collapsers
ablaze
in
our
direction
any
moment
now
we
all
be
separated
into
hot
protons
and
flying
clouds
of
electronic
sparks
i
came
to
a
stumbling
halt
and
ceased
all
conjecture
for
just
inside
those
glass
doors
chief
philip
baxter
was
standing
with
his
hands
raised
over
his
head
and
there
were
men
approaching
him
with
drawn
weapons
and
not
the
rebels
either
his
own
security
guards
is
had
won
hey
said
ted
tugging
at
my
arm
they
must
have
gotten
my
message
lucky
thing
the
rebels
were
the
losers
hey
i
spun
about
giving
him
a
dazed
look
what
message
was
all
i
could
choke
out
in
the
he
said
happily
i
scratched
it
on
the
wall
over
my
takeoff
rack
i
did
see
any
message
i
complained
it
was
in
code
he
explained
with
the
condescension
toward
an
idiot
of
which
only
small
boys
are
capable
snow
and
me
we
have
a
secret
code
i
know
that
i
growled
but
how
in
the
world
he
gave
a
lazy
shrug
you
probably
notice
it
because
you
did
know
the
code
otherwise
it
looks
like
but
i
was
pretty
sure
a
good
cryptograph
man
would
figure
it
out
it
only
a
substitution
code
after
all
and
what
was
the
message
i
said
repressing
a
sudden
urge
to
swear
at
him
ted
yawned
idly
and
scratched
his
stomach
i
just
said
we
have
been
kidnapped
by
chief
baxter
of
interplanetary
security
sincerely
yours
ted
white
space
scout
first
class
it
was
the
truth
of
course
but
i
figured
it
get
an
investigation
started
and
then
baxter
goose
would
be
cooked
before
i
could
mutter
a
small
curse
there
came
a
sudden
blast
of
energy
from
the
terminal
building
and
the
glass
doors
came
flying
open
i
saw
a
figure
come
dashing
out
of
there
and
realized
that
baxter
was
once
more
on
the
loose
the
shield
i
groaned
his
had
been
only
a
reflex
action
i
only
gave
one
quick
glance
toward
the
terminal
lobby
where
the
remaining
men
were
just
getting
their
wits
about
them
then
i
took
off
after
him
again
it
was
going
to
be
a
close
thing
i
realized
he
had
a
good
lead
on
me
at
the
end
of
the
strip
opposite
to
where
we
emerged
from
the
labyrinth
stood
a
ship
it
was
baxter
personal
ship
marked
with
the
colors
and
seal
of
is
if
he
once
got
aboard
he
could
get
away
forever
but
even
worse
he
could
train
his
ship
collapser
on
the
entire
spaceport
and
blast
us
all
out
of
existence
i
could
see
i
was
going
to
make
it
he
was
a
full
hundred
yards
ahead
of
me
by
the
time
i
reached
the
ship
he
be
pressing
the
starter
button
and
all
i
get
for
my
efforts
would
be
the
searing
fires
of
the
rockets
in
my
face
as
the
great
ship
lifted
then
a
bounding
form
was
whizzing
past
me
covering
thirty
feet
at
a
leap
clatclit
was
on
the
trail
of
the
man
who
had
threatened
his
destruction
back
in
the
labyrinth
shrill
furious
clackings
came
from
within
those
jaws
as
the
sugarfoot
rapidly
closed
the
gap
between
himself
and
the
man
and
still
something
kept
me
racing
across
that
field
some
subconscious
foreboding
that
things
were
finished
yet
then
baxter
came
to
a
halt
still
twenty
yards
from
the
ship
and
turned
about
something
in
his
hand
from
the
cart
the
hose
for
the
water
tanks
clatclit
i
yelled
frantically
as
if
not
realizing
his
danger
the
hurtling
form
of
my
alien
friend
zoomed
down
toward
baxter
powerful
claws
held
wide
for
grasping
his
enemy
things
happened
terribly
fast
from
behind
me
i
heard
a
scream
and
then
a
curse
i
staggered
and
turned
snow
was
wrestling
on
the
ground
with
a
security
agent
one
of
the
survivors
of
the
backlash
of
baxter
shield
evidently
he
been
about
to
try
another
shot
at
the
fleeing
security
chief
and
snow
with
unladylike
good
sense
had
given
him
the
benefit
of
one
of
her
flying
tackles
before
we
all
died
in
a
new
rebounding
ray
a
wild
trilling
whistle
came
from
the
ship
and
i
jerked
my
head
about
baxter
had
let
loose
with
the
hose
and
clatclit
was
rolling
on
the
ground
in
a
wild
effort
to
shake
the
caustic
droplets
from
his
melting
scales
my
head
was
spinning
which
was
to
turn
snow
was
in
a
furious
fight
with
a
man
behind
me
and
my
best
friend
was
being
dissolved
before
me
i
did
know
what
to
do
should
i
run
and
stop
her
from
being
vaporized
or
him
from
being
turned
into
taffy
baxter
took
the
decision
out
of
my
hands
delvin
his
voice
came
i
turned
back
toward
him
clatclit
still
shuddering
with
the
shock
of
that
was
facing
me
baxter
behind
him
with
an
arm
across
the
sugarfoot
throat
and
in
baxter
other
hand
he
held
the
water
hose
its
barrel
aimed
right
at
clatclit
eyes
tell
the
others
to
stand
back
he
shouted
or
i
burn
your
friend
eyes
out
by
now
snow
had
explained
the
situation
somewhat
to
the
guard
i
guess
because
she
and
he
came
abreast
of
me
and
stopped
listening
to
baxter
threat
the
guard
gun
came
up
swiftly
do
you
fool
i
said
my
hand
clamping
on
his
wrist
he
got
a
shield
i
know
that
said
the
guard
whom
i
suddenly
recognized
as
the
corporal
who
had
led
his
men
to
investigate
the
blast
in
the
upper
corridor
i
only
going
to
disable
the
ship
no
baxter
called
if
the
ship
goes
then
so
do
this
eyes
the
corporal
looked
at
me
wavering
it
it
only
a
sugarfoot
he
said
uncertainly
only
a
i
shrieked
how
could
i
tell
this
idiot
what
i
felt
for
clatclit
you
shoot
over
my
bloody
corpse
we
ca
let
baxter
get
aloft
in
that
thing
the
corporal
said
beseechingly
if
he
does
we
all
dead
i
was
trembling
with
fear
and
frustrated
rage
baxter
was
backing
toward
the
ship
taking
the
weakened
clatclit
backward
with
him
they
were
only
a
few
feet
from
the
entry
port
now
then
my
hand
went
out
and
i
took
the
corporal
collapser
from
him
he
stared
at
me
confusedly
but
let
me
take
it
everybody
hit
the
dirt
i
said
lifting
the
weapon
and
taking
careful
aim
guard
girl
and
scouts
took
a
dive
i
was
neither
aiming
at
baxter
nor
his
ship
the
blazing
bolt
of
energy
from
the
collapser
an
instant
before
i
joined
snow
the
corporal
and
the
space
scouts
on
the
ground
went
where
i
intended
it
to
into
the
nearest
supporting
girder
of
the
massive
converter
as
in
a
nightmare
the
structure
began
to
tilt
with
the
uneven
distribution
of
weight
toward
the
spot
where
a
supporting
leg
should
have
been
and
then
the
brightly
burning
rays
of
the
head
came
arcing
down
in
a
deadly
sweep
that
passed
over
baxter
clatclit
and
the
ship
narrowly
missing
the
spot
where
the
rest
of
us
lay
then
the
power
cables
tore
away
and
the
beam
went
out
it
was
all
over
the
ship
of
alloys
was
in
perfectly
fine
shape
clatclit
of
pure
sugar
construction
was
if
a
bit
alive
and
healthy
but
baxter
the
converter
had
been
designed
with
one
function
to
turn
ferrous
oxide
plain
old
rusted
iron
into
its
components
in
the
force
of
its
ray
the
oxide
became
free
oxygen
and
molten
iron
and
the
blood
of
a
human
being
is
made
up
of
amongst
other
things
tiny
cells
which
have
the
presence
of
oxidized
iron
to
thank
for
their
bright
red
color
when
we
got
to
baxter
he
was
long
past
screaming
you
ca
make
much
noise
when
you
a
solid
blister
ten
feet
in
diameter
hey
jery
said
ted
on
the
rocket
back
to
earth
how
come
you
and
snow
fell
in
love
so
quick
hey
i
looked
from
snow
seated
beside
me
on
the
lounge
my
arm
across
her
shoulders
to
the
viewport
through
which
i
could
see
the
dwindling
red
globe
that
was
mars
well
i
said
trying
to
think
of
an
answer
across
from
us
squatting
happily
on
a
specially
provided
stool
was
clatclit
as
of
the
sugarfoot
nation
to
earth
and
the
first
extraterrestrial
permitted
to
land
on
our
home
planet
he
was
mighty
proud
of
his
upcoming
honor
clatclit
the
sugarfoot
clacked
something
i
looked
at
him
he
pointed
to
his
wrist
and
shook
his
head
i
grinned
there
your
answer
ted
there
was
time
to
fall
in
love
slowly
ted
stared
at
the
carpet
and
sulked
i
had
already
in
a
state
of
nerves
shattered
his
composure
not
a
little
by
angrily
telling
him
that
his
code
was
really
a
cipher
he
been
unwontedly
morose
ever
since
i
felt
kind
of
bad
about
it
but
could
find
an
opportunity
as
yet
of
getting
his
ego
back
on
its
feet
then
clatclit
resplendent
in
his
ruby
scales
made
another
noise
i
looked
at
him
again
he
made
a
gesture
then
tapped
his
wrist
a
while
ago
i
interpreted
aloud
for
snow
benefit
and
ted
if
he
was
too
sunken
in
gloom
to
listen
he
put
one
hand
to
his
throat
and
pointed
an
index
finger
at
his
eyes
when
baxter
was
holding
you
as
hostage
he
pointed
to
me
then
made
a
gesture
with
the
finger
followed
by
a
point
back
over
and
above
his
shoulder
toward
where
that
converter
had
been
in
relation
to
himself
why
did
i
blast
the
converter
nod
i
stared
what
else
was
there
to
do
it
was
a
little
rough
on
baxter
but
i
had
to
save
you
did
i
headshake
i
did
have
to
save
you
that
way
i
remarked
ted
was
watching
clatclit
with
interest
i
noticed
his
eyes
dancing
with
fascination
at
this
means
of
communication
clatclit
shook
his
head
okay
i
bite
i
said
puzzled
what
would
have
done
in
my
spot
gesture
then
serpentine
motion
with
his
hand
shot
the
the
lava
tunnels
disgusted
stare
threw
a
snake
at
him
i
hazarded
bewildered
abruptly
ted
laughed
i
looked
at
him
chagrined
after
all
he
could
expect
me
to
be
at
my
brightest
in
the
presence
of
his
sister
though
he
was
a
little
young
to
understand
such
things
i
suppose
you
know
what
he
means
i
said
ted
continued
to
laugh
a
high
giggle
which
seemed
in
itself
to
afford
him
additional
amusement
okay
okay
i
said
to
him
give
what
did
clatclit
say
i
could
have
done
that
would
have
spared
baxter
and
saved
him
from
dissolving
anyhow
ted
managed
to
squeak
out
between
gusts
of
delight
clatclit
says
that
if
he
had
been
doing
the
shooting
he
would
just
have
disintegrated
he
rolled
onto
his
face
on
the
lounge
sofa
and
could
go
on
disintegrated
what
i
demanded
baffled
ted
snorted
lifting
his
face
to
look
for
the
reaction
on
mine
the
water
hose
i
stared
stupidly
then
broke
into
a
grin
i
decided
not
to
mention
to
him
that
a
metal
girder
is
a
hell
of
an
easier
target
than
a
diameter
of
flexible
tubing
what
the
hell
i
had
snow
clatclit
had
a
whole
skin
and
well
growing
boys
need
their
ego
