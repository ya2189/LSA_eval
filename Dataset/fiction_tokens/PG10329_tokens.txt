once
myself

downstairs
and
kissed

they
jumped
into
the
wheelbarrow
and
bunny
wheeled
them
to
the
turn
in
the
road
he
kissed
them
and
snubby
nose
cried
and
he
screamed
and

as
ugly
as

he
cried
and
he
screamed
and
he
howled
louder

something

be
done
so
he
said
oh

mind
i
will
go
home
with
you
it
will
be
a
long
walk
around
then
to
my
house
they
both
went
east
snubby
nose
said

what
is
that
it
sounds
like
a
band
tippy
toes
said
what
is
that
it
sounds
like
the
roar
of
a
lion
they
did
not
know
whether
to
go
east
any
longer
or
not
they
hid
behind
some
bushes
by
the
roadside
and
all
the
while
the
sound
of
the
band
came
nearer
and
nearer
all
the
while
the
lion
roared
louder
and
louder
they
peeped
through
the
branches
soon
the
circus
came
in
view

soon
the
circus

out
of

hiding
places
and

a
little
mirror
out
of
his
pocket
and

doctor

the
life
for

snubby
nose
and
tippy

chapter
i
bunny
and
susan
were
sitting
by
the
fire
warming
their
paws
illustration
bunny
and
susan
were
sitting
by
the
fire
the
evenings
are
growing
cold
said
bunny
it
feels
like
snow
oh
joy
cried
bunny
boy
how
i
do
love
snow
then
he
began
to
jump
around
the
room
so
fast
that
susan
was
afraid
he
would
upset
the
table
i
am
going
to
play
that
the
sofa
is
a
hill
and
slide
down
he
cried
then
susan
said
if
bunny
boy
did
not
sit
down
in
his
little
red
rocking
chair
and
be
good
she
would
put
him
in
a
bag
so
bunny
boy
sat
down
but
he
began
to
cry
there
is
no
telling
what
would
have
happened
just
then
if
a
soft
tap
tap
had
not
been
heard
on
the
window
susan
looked
out
there
stood
bushy
tail
with
his
traveling
bag
in
his
hand
susan
was
a
little
afraid
to
let
him
in
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
so
she
opened
the
door
and
whisk
bound
bushy
tail
was
in
hugging
bunny
who
is
the
youngster
asked
bushy
tail
pointing
to
bunny
boy
then
bunny
boy
made
himself
as
small
as
possible
he
did
not
care
for
bushy
tail
bushy
tail
said
he
must
tell
about
his
trip
besides
he
had
something
for
bunny
and
susan
in
his
bag
it
had
begun
to
snow
and
bushy
tail
was
very
wet
he
stood
by
the
fire
and
warmed
his
paws
susan
whispered
to
bunny
that
she
had
never
seen
so
handsome
a
fox
in
her
life
all
the
time
bushy
tail
had
a
cunning
look
in
his
eyes
after
his
fur
was
dry
and
he
had
had
a
bowl
of
soup
he
opened
his
bag
and
my
what
fine
things
he
took
out
there
was
dried
fruit
for
susan
there
was
fresh
cabbage
for
bunny
and
there
were
oranges
and
peaches
and
pears
they
had
a
fine
feast
but
the
greatest
fun
of
all
was
just
before
they
went
to
bed
when
bushy
tail
took
from
his
bag
a
little
telephone
he
hung
it
on
the
wall
and
fooled
the
rabbits
with
it
for
nearly
an
hour
it
had
a
little
bell
and
a
receiver
and
one
could
call
hello
into
it
perhaps
bunny
and
susan
would
never
have
known
the
joke
about
the
telephone
if
it
had
not
been
for
bunny
boy
bunny
boy
crept
out
from
under
the
sofa
where
he
had
been
hiding
and
climbed
up
in
a
chair
and
pulled
the
receiver
hard
then
bang
the
top
of
the
telephone
came
off
and
showed
that
it
was
only
a
candy
box
bushy
tail
did
not
like
this
but
bunny
said
he
would
rather
have
it
a
after
all
as
he
was
a
little
afraid
of
telephones
then
they
shook
one
another
paws
and
went
to
bed
bushy
tail
slept
on
a
sofa
in
the
parlor
about
eleven
he
got
up
and
began
to
stir
around
there
was
the
same
cunning
look
in
his
eyes
first
he
went
and
looked
at
susan
and
thought
i
have
half
a
mind
to
eat
you
up
then
he
went
and
looked
at
bunny
and
thought
i
have
half
a
mind
to
eat
you
up
then
he
saw
bunny
boy
out
in
the
kitchen
wide
awake
eating
mince
pie
bushy
said
i
have
you
and
i
will
eat
you
up
but
bunny
boy
was
too
quick
for
him
he
ran
down
the
stairs
into
the
cellar
and
had
hopped
through
the
cellar
window
in
less
than
no
time
then
bushy
tail
took
a
mince
pie
and
put
it
in
his
coat
pocket
he
took
a
currant
pie
and
put
it
in
his
coat
pocket
he
hid
an
apple
pie
in
his
hat
and
he
went
slyly
out
of
the
door
with
a
piece
of
blueberry
pie
in
his
mouth
next
morning
when
bunny
and
susan
awoke
they
saw
that
their
pies
were
gone
and
they
saw
that
bushy
tail
and
bunny
boy
were
gone
too
susan
cried
and
bunny
whistled
chapter
ii
why
do
you
suppose
susan
had
made
so
many
pies
there
was
going
to
be
a
fair
and
susan
had
been
asked
to
make
pies
for
it
all
the
animals
were
going
to
the
fair
we
can
not
go
when
we
have
no
pies
to
sell
said
susan
all
the
animals
will
come
to
find
out
why
we
are
not
there
said
bunny
now
bunny
was
a
very
clever
rabbit
even
though
he
was
getting
old
he
put
on
his
overcoat
and
took
a
card
and
a
hammer
and
went
out
he
was
out
a
long
time
tacking
something
up
on
the
front
door
when
he
had
finished
he
asked
susan
to
come
out
and
get
a
breath
of
air
they
walked
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
house
then
susan
began
to
laugh
and
then
she
began
to
sneeze
and
then
she
laughed
and
sneezed
together
and
what
do
you
suppose
was
the
matter
bunny
had
put
up
this
sign
on
the
house
scarlet
fever
here
well
said
bunny
if
you
do
want
to
go
anywhere
or
have
any
one
come
to
see
you
just
put
up
a
sign
like
that
and
see
how
well
it
will
work
bunny
and
susan
went
back
into
the
house
and
peeped
out
their
front
window
to
see
how
the
animals
would
act
when
they
saw
the
sign
first
came
bushy
tail
big
as
life
trotting
along
when
he
saw
the
sign
he
waved
his
beautiful
tail
in
the
air
and
ran
down
the
road
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
next
came
owl
he
read
the
sign
aloud
and
flew
away
so
all
day
long
animals
came
to
ask
why
bunny
and
susan
did
not
come
to
the
fair
and
all
were
frightened
and
ran
away
early
in
the
evening
old
grizzly
came
he
had
followed
bushy
tail
from
california
what
a
beautiful
bear
said
susan
he
looks
kind
said
bunny
old
grizzly
read
the
sign
he
did
not
pass
by
as
the
other
animals
had
done
he
went
straight
up
to
the
front
door
and
knocked
perhaps
he
ca
read
said
bunny
so
he
shouted
scarlet
fever
here
old
grizzly
nodded
his
head
he
said
he
had
had
scarlet
fever
three
times
and
he
was
not
afraid
to
have
it
again
so
they
opened
the
door
and
let
old
grizzly
in
then
they
all
had
a
jolly
time
and
bunny
told
why
he
put
up
the
sign
on
the
house
you
may
have
a
new
kind
of
scarlet
fever
said
old
grizzly
maybe
i
shall
catch
it
and
they
all
laughed
old
grizzly
had
been
in
a
circus
and
had
traveled
in
the
east
and
in
the
west
he
could
tell
lovely
stories
so
he
stayed
a
long
time
and
told
stories
and
susan
went
out
in
the
kitchen
and
came
back
with
a
mince
pie
in
each
hand
these
pies
had
been
hidden
away
in
a
tin
they
all
enjoyed
the
pies
and
then
bunny
asked
old
grizzly
to
spend
the
night
with
them
old
grizzly
said
no
thank
you
the
house
next
door
was
vacant
and
he
was
going
to
live
there
susan
held
the
candle
at
the
door
and
old
grizzly
went
to
his
new
home
i
like
him
but
i
am
glad
he
went
out
for
the
night
said
bunny
just
think
susan
said
he
has
promised
to
come
in
every
night
and
tell
us
a
story
chapter
iii
when
old
grizzly
came
next
evening
he
had
a
book
tucked
under
his
arm
what
have
you
there
asked
bunny
and
susan
together
it
was
some
time
before
old
grizzly
would
tell
then
he
coughed
and
said
he
had
one
story
that
every
one
liked
so
well
that
he
had
written
it
down
and
drawn
pictures
for
it
the
two
rabbits
begged
so
hard
to
see
the
pictures
that
old
grizzly
opened
the
book
and
showed
them
all
the
pictures
before
he
began
to
read
and
this
is
the
story
he
read
once
there
was
a
gentleman
who
wrote
stories
he
had
a
fine
large
cat
called
whiskers
one
day
whiskers
thought
he
would
see
the
man
write
his
story
so
he
sat
up
on
the
desk
beside
him
the
man
started
to
write
a
story
about
an
elephant
it
was
to
be
a
long
story
with
big
words
in
it
whiskers
wanted
to
be
petted
just
then
and
as
the
man
did
not
notice
him
he
gave
the
pen
a
little
slap
and
it
made
a
funny
mark
down
the
page
never
mind
said
the
man
that
will
do
for
the
path
along
which
the
elephant
walked
the
man
pen
was
a
lovely
thing
to
play
with
but
whiskers
had
a
nicer
plaything
himself
he
began
to
go
round
and
round
after
his
own
tail
round
and
round
he
went
until
he
upset
the
ink
then
he
was
so
scared
that
he
ran
and
hid
the
man
only
laughed
and
said
he
would
draw
funny
little
figures
where
the
blots
of
ink
were
he
called
whiskers
back
and
went
on
with
his
story
he
was
just
wondering
how
he
would
draw
the
seats
inside
the
circus
tent
when
whiskers
put
his
paw
down
on
the
wet
page
and
the
man
said
why
whiskers
you
certainly
are
an
artist
then
he
began
to
wonder
how
he
could
show
what
a
big
space
the
elephant
covered
when
he
walked
and
just
then
the
cat
walked
over
the
paper
to
show
him
the
man
was
so
pleased
then
that
he
laid
down
his
pen
and
gave
whiskers
a
big
hug
pooh
said
whiskers
that
was
nothing
i
could
write
a
better
story
than
you
can
any
day
you
see
whiskers
was
not
a
polite
cat
did
whiskers
write
the
story
asked
bunny
susan
winked
at
bunny
and
said
old
grizzly
that
is
the
best
story
of
all
and
i
believe
you
made
it
up
yourself
then
old
grizzly
blushed
under
the
fur
on
his
cheeks
and
bunny
ran
and
got
a
big
bouquet
and
stuck
it
in
his
paw
old
grizzly
went
home
feeling
very
happy
indeed
chapter
iv
the
next
evening
susan
begged
old
grizzly
to
tell
her
another
story
about
whiskers
grizzly
said
he
knew
one
but
he
kept
it
in
the
back
of
his
head
and
he
could
not
find
it
so
he
told
them
the
story
of
carlo
instead
carlo
was
a
fine
dog
he
had
but
one
fault
he
liked
to
suck
eggs
day
after
day
the
cook
went
out
into
the
to
get
eggs
and
day
after
day
there
were
no
eggs
to
be
found
at
first
she
thought
it
must
be
a
rat
that
stole
her
eggs
and
she
set
a
trap
a
clever
old
rat
came
and
ate
the
cheese
but
he
never
got
caught
one
day
the
cook
saw
carlo
sucking
an
egg
whisk
she
was
after
him
with
a
broom
and
gave
him
a
sound
beating
but
this
did
not
cure
carlo
of
his
bad
habit
he
went
into
the
and
stole
eggs
whenever
he
pleased
the
cook
said
she
was
not
going
to
allow
this
so
one
day
she
called
the
dog
to
her
in
a
most
friendly
way
and
held
out
half
an
egg
in
her
hand
carlo
thought
that
the
cook
had
made
up
her
mind
to
let
him
eat
all
the
eggs
he
wanted
so
he
took
the
egg
in
his
mouth
and
swallowed
it
quickly
then
he
began
to
behave
very
strangely
he
yelped
with
pain
and
ran
out
into
the
yard
and
rolled
over
and
over
in
the
snow
good
now
you
will
steal
no
more
eggs
said
the
cook
what
do
you
suppose
was
the
matter
with
carlo
the
egg
the
cook
had
given
him
was
full
of
red
pepper
and
his
mouth
burned
as
though
on
fire
there
is
no
telling
what
the
poor
dog
would
have
done
if
a
little
girl
had
not
come
along
just
then
the
little
girl
had
found
out
what
the
cook
had
done
she
crept
out
of
the
house
and
said
poor
carlo
poor
doggie
come
to
me
and
then
she
took
snow
and
washed
out
carlo
mouth
and
patted
him
on
the
head
until
he
felt
all
right
again
carlo
never
forgot
the
little
girl
kindness
and
he
never
stole
eggs
any
more
just
as
old
grizzly
stopped
speaking
tap
tap
was
heard
on
the
window
they
looked
up
and
saw
bushy
tail
outside
let
him
in
i
see
that
he
does
no
harm
said
old
grizzly
they
door
and
bushy
tail
jumped
in
now
bushy
tail
would
not
have
come
if
he
had
not
had
something
to
say
for
he
felt
a
little
ashamed
about
the
pies
what
do
you
suppose
bushy
tail
had
come
to
say
he
had
heard
of
a
big
gold
mine
in
the
west
and
he
wanted
grizzly
bear
and
the
family
to
go
west
with
him
to
buy
the
gold
mine
old
grizzly
was
delighted
with
the
idea
but
bunny
and
susan
said
they
would
rather
stay
at
home
as
they
were
talking
tap
tap
was
heard
on
the
window
again
and
there
stood
bunny
boy
he
had
come
home
from
his
travels
bunny
boy
head
was
tied
up
and
he
looked
as
though
he
had
had
a
hard
time
susan
asked
if
he
would
like
to
go
west
and
look
for
gold
but
bunny
boy
only
shook
his
head
