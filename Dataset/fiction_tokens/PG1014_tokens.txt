the
lure
of
the
dim
trails
by
bower
chapter
i
in
search
of
the
western
tone
do
you
care
anyway
asked
philosophically
is
as
if
you
depended
on
the
work
for
a
living
why
worry
over
the
fact
that
a
mere
pastime
fails
to
be
financially
a
success
you
need
to
write
do
you
need
to
slave
over
those
things
thurston
retorted
in
none
the
best
humor
with
his
comforter
an
income
bigger
than
mine
yet
you
toil
over
women
with
untidy
hair
as
if
each
one
meant
a
meal
and
a
meal
and
a
bed
that
good
you
must
think
i
live
like
a
i
notice
you
hate
like
the
mischief
to
fail
even
i
never
have
failed
put
in
with
the
amused
complacency
born
of
much
adulation
thurston
kicked
a
out
of
his
way
i
have
the
fashion
now
is
for
swashbuckling
tales
with
a
haze
of
powder
smoke
rising
to
high
heaven
the
public
taste
runs
to
gore
and
more
gore
and
kidnappings
of
beautiful
the
fashion
then
if
you
must
write
get
out
of
your
pink
tea
and
orchid
atmosphere
and
take
your
heroines
out
west
away
out
beyond
the
mississippi
and
let
them
be
kidnapped
or
new
mexico
would
mexico
is
also
beyond
the
mississippi
i
believe
thurston
hinted
it
is
what
i
mean
is
write
what
the
public
wants
since
you
do
relish
failure
why
do
you
do
things
about
the
plains
it
ought
to
be
easy
and
you
were
born
out
there
somewhere
it
should
come
have
thurston
sighed
last
rejection
states
that
the
local
color
is
weak
and
unconvincing
hang
the
local
color
the
suffered
again
was
getting
into
his
topcoat
languidly
as
he
did
everything
else
thing
to
do
then
he
drawled
to
go
out
and
study
up
on
it
get
in
touch
with
that
country
and
your
local
color
will
convince
personally
though
i
like
those
little
society
skits
you
do
exploded
thurston
last
was
a
serial
i
never
did
a
skit
in
my
is
more
than
you
did
after
accusing
my
studies
of
having
untidy
hair
do
look
so
glum
phil
go
out
and
learn
your
west
a
month
or
so
will
put
you
up
to
date
and
by
jove
i
half
envy
you
the
that
is
what
put
the
idea
into
thurston
head
and
as
thurston
ideas
generally
bore
fruit
of
one
sort
or
another
he
went
out
that
very
day
and
ordered
from
his
tailor
a
complete
riding
outfit
and
because
he
was
a
good
customer
the
tailor
consented
to
rush
the
work
it
seemed
to
thurston
looking
over
cuts
of
the
very
latest
styles
in
riding
clothes
that
already
he
was
breathing
the
atmosphere
of
the
plains
that
night
he
stayed
at
home
and
dreamed
of
the
west
his
memory
coupled
with
what
he
had
heard
and
idealized
by
his
imagination
conjured
dim
visions
of
what
he
had
once
known
had
known
and
forgotten
of
a
land
here
men
and
conditions
harked
back
to
the
raw
foundations
of
civilization
where
wide
plains
flecked
with
and
ribboned
with
faint
brown
trails
spread
away
and
away
to
a
far
for
phil
thurston
was
if
not
his
father
had
chosen
always
to
live
out
on
the
edge
of
things
out
where
the
trails
of
men
are
dim
and
far
the
silent
prairie
bequeaths
a
heritage
of
to
her
sons
while
he
brooded
grew
a
keen
longing
to
see
again
the
little
town
huddled
under
the
bare
brown
hills
that
shut
out
the
world
to
see
the
indians
who
stole
like
painted
shadows
about
the
place
and
the
broad
river
always
hurrying
away
to
the
sunrise
he
had
been
afraid
of
the
river
and
of
the
bare
hills
and
the
indians
he
felt
that
his
mother
also
had
been
afraid
he
pictured
again
and
he
picture
was
blurred
and
day
when
strange
men
had
brought
his
father
mysteriously
home
men
who
were
silent
save
for
the
shuffling
of
their
feet
and
who
carried
their
big
hats
awkwardly
in
their
hands
there
had
been
a
day
of
hushed
voices
and
much
weeping
and
gloom
and
he
had
been
afraid
to
play
then
they
had
carried
his
father
as
mysteriously
away
again
and
his
mother
had
hugged
him
close
and
cried
bitterly
and
long
the
rest
was
blank
when
one
is
only
five
the
present
quickly
blurs
what
is
past
and
he
wondered
that
after
all
these
years
he
should
feel
the
grip
of
something
very
like
homesickness
and
for
something
more
than
half
forgotten
but
though
he
did
not
realize
it
in
his
veins
flowed
the
adventurous
blood
of
his
father
and
to
it
the
dim
trails
were
calling
in
four
days
he
set
his
face
eagerly
toward
the
dun
deserts
and
the
gray
at
chicago
a
man
took
the
upper
berth
in
thurston
section
and
settled
into
the
seat
with
a
deep
sigh
presumably
of
thankfulness
thurston
with
the
quick
eye
of
those
who
write
observed
the
whiteness
of
his
ungloved
hands
the
coppery
tan
of
cheeks
and
throat
the
clear
keenness
of
his
eyes
and
the
four
dimples
in
the
crown
of
his
soft
gray
hat
and
recognized
him
as
a
fine
specimen
of
the
western
type
of
farmer
returning
home
from
the
stockman
mecca
after
that
he
went
calmly
back
to
his
magazine
and
forgot
all
about
him
twenty
miles
out
the
stranger
leaned
forward
and
tapped
him
lightly
on
the
knee
i
hate
to
interrupt
yuh
he
began
in
a
whimsical
drawl
evidently
characteristic
of
the
man
i
like
to
know
where
it
is
i
seen
yuh
thurston
glanced
up
impersonally
hesitated
between
annoyance
and
a
natural
desire
to
be
courteous
and
replied
that
he
had
no
memory
of
any
previous
meeting
not
admitted
the
other
and
searched
the
face
of
thurston
with
his
keen
eyes
it
came
to
phil
that
they
were
also
a
bit
wistful
but
he
went
unsympathetically
back
to
his
reading
five
miles
more
and
be
touched
thurston
again
apologetically
yet
insistently
he
drawled
your
name
thurston
i
bet
a
carload
uh
steers
it
is
bud
thurston
and
your
home
range
is
fort
phil
stared
and
confessed
to
all
but
the
what
me
and
your
dad
always
called
yuh
the
man
asserted
i
be
hanged
but
i
knew
it
i
knew
i
run
acrost
yuh
somewheres
you
the
dead
image
uh
your
dad
bill
thurston
and
me
and
bill
freighted
together
from
to
benton
along
in
the
seventies
before
yuh
was
born
we
was
chums
i
do
reckon
you
remember
me
hank
graves
that
used
to
pack
yuh
around
on
his
back
and
fill
yuh
up
on
dried
prunes
when
dried
prunes
was
worth
money
yuh
used
to
call
and
why
it
was
me
with
your
dad
when
the
indians
him
at
chimney
rock
and
it
was
me
helped
your
mother
straighten
things
up
so
she
could
pull
out
back
where
she
come
from
she
never
took
to
the
west
much
how
is
she
dead
too
bad
she
was
a
mighty
fine
woman
your
mother
was
bud
thurston
little
bud
that
used
to
holler
for
if
he
seen
me
coming
a
mile
off
doggone
your
measly
hide
where
all
them
pink
apurns
yuh
used
to
wear
he
leaned
back
and
laughed
a
silent
inner
convulsion
of
pure
gladness
philip
thurston
was
generally
speaking
a
conservative
young
man
and
one
slow
to
make
friends
slower
still
to
discard
them
he
was
astonished
to
feel
a
choky
sensation
in
his
throat
and
a
stinging
of
eyelids
and
a
leap
in
his
blood
to
be
thus
taken
possession
of
by
a
stranger
not
at
all
in
his
class
to
be
addressed
as
and
informed
that
he
once
devoured
dried
prunes
to
be
told
your
measly
should
have
affronted
him
much
instead
he
seemed
to
be
swept
mysteriously
back
into
the
primitive
past
and
to
feel
akin
to
this
stranger
with
the
drawl
and
the
keen
eyes
it
was
the
blood
of
his
father
coming
to
its
own
from
that
hour
the
two
were
friends
hank
graves
in
his
whimsical
drawl
told
phil
things
about
his
father
that
made
his
blood
tingle
with
pride
his
father
whom
he
had
almost
forgotten
yet
who
had
lived
bravely
his
life
daring
where
other
men
quailed
going
steadfastly
upon
his
way
when
other
men
hesitated
so
borne
swiftly
into
the
west
they
talked
and
the
time
seemed
short
the
train
had
long
since
been
racing
noisily
over
the
silent
prairies
spread
invitingly
with
tender
green
great
lonely
inscrutable
luring
men
with
a
spell
as
sure
and
as
strong
as
is
the
spell
of
the
sea
the
train
reeled
across
a
trestle
that
spanned
a
deep
dry
gash
in
the
earth
in
the
green
bottom
huddled
a
cluster
of
pygmy
cattle
and
mounted
men
farther
down
were
two
white
flakes
of
tents
like
huge
snowflakes
left
unmelted
in
the
green
canyon
the
lazy
eight
my
outfit
graves
informed
thurston
with
the
unconscious
pride
of
possession
pointing
a
forefinger
as
they
whirled
on
got
to
get
off
next
station
yuh
want
to
remember
bud
the
lazy
eight
your
home
from
now
on
we
make
a
of
yuh
in
no
time
you
got
it
in
yuh
or
yuh
would
look
so
much
like
your
dad
and
you
can
write
stories
about
us
all
yuh
want
we
wo
kick
the
way
i
got
the
summer
planned
out
you
waller
in
material
all
yuh
got
to
do
is
foller
the
lazy
eight
through
till
shipping
thurston
had
not
intended
learning
to
be
a
or
following
the
lazy
eight
or
any
other
hieroglyphic
through
shipping
time
whenever
that
was
but
facing
hank
graves
he
had
not
the
heart
to
tell
him
so
or
that
he
had
planned
to
spend
only
a
month
or
six
weeks
at
most
in
the
west
gathering
local
color
and
perhaps
a
plot
or
two
and
a
few
types
thurston
was
great
on
types
the
train
slowed
at
a
little
station
with
a
dismal
red
section
house
in
the
immediate
background
and
a
saloon
close
beside
we
are
cried
graves
i
ai
sorry
only
i
wisht
you
was
going
to
stop
right
now
but
i
look
for
yuh
in
three
or
four
days
at
the
outside
bud
remember
the
lazy
eight
your
chapter
ii
local
color
in
the
raw
for
the
rest
of
the
way
thurston
watched
the
green
hills
slide
by
and
the
greener
hollows
and
gave
himself
up
to
visions
of
fort
benton
visions
of
creaking
crawling
slowly
like
giant
brown
worms
up
and
down
the
long
hill
of
many
bales
of
buffalo
hides
upon
the
river
bank
and
clamorous
little
steamers
churning
up
against
the
current
the
fort
benton
that
had
for
many
rushing
miles
filled
and
colored
the
speech
of
hank
graves
and
stimulated
his
childish
but
when
he
reached
the
place
and
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
streets
the
vision
faded
into
realization
that
these
things
were
no
more
forever
for
the
a
roundup
outfit
clattered
noisily
out
of
town
and
disappeared
in
an
elusive
for
the
indians
slipping
like
painted
shadows
from
view
stray
galloped
into
town
slid
from
their
saddles
and
clanked
with
dragging
rowels
into
the
nearest
saloon
or
the
between
whiles
the
town
cuddled
luxuriously
down
in
the
deep
little
valley
and
slept
while
the
river
undisturbed
by
pompous
steamers
murmured
a
lullaby
it
was
not
the
fort
benton
he
had
come
far
to
see
so
that
on
the
second
day
he
went
away
up
the
long
hill
that
shut
out
the
world
and
until
the
train
came
from
over
the
prairies
paced
the
depot
platform
impatiently
with
never
a
vision
to
keep
him
company
for
a
long
time
the
gaze
of
thurston
clung
fascinated
to
the
wide
prairie
land
feeling
again
the
stir
in
his
blood
then
when
a
deep
cut
shut
from
him
the
sight
of
the
wilderness
he
chanced
to
turn
his
head
and
looked
straight
into
the
clear
eyes
of
a
girl
across
the
aisle
thurston
considered
himself
immune
from
or
any
so
that
he
permitted
himself
to
regard
her
calmly
and
judicially
his
mind
reverting
to
the
fact
that
he
would
need
a
heroine
to
be
kidnapped
and
wondering
if
she
would
do
she
was
a
western
girl
he
could
tell
that
by
the
tan
and
by
her
various
little
departures
from
the
eastern
styles
such
as
doing
her
hair
low
rather
than
high
where
he
had
been
used
to
seeing
the
hair
of
woman
piled
high
and
skewered
with
many
pins
hers
was
brushed
smoothly
save
for
little
irresponsible
waves
here
and
there
thurston
decided
that
the
style
was
becoming
to
her
he
wondered
if
the
fellow
beside
her
were
her
brother
and
then
reminded
himself
sagely
that
brothers
do
not
as
a
rule
devote
their
time
quite
so
assiduously
to
the
entertainment
of
their
sisters
he
could
not
stare
at
her
forever
and
so
he
gave
over
his
speculations
and
went
back
to
the
prairies
another
hour
and
thurston
was
stiffing
a
yawn
when
the
coaches
bumped
sharply
together
and
with
wheels
screeching
protest
as
the
brakes
clutched
them
the
train
grinding
protest
in
every
joint
came
with
a
final
heavy
jar
to
a
dead
stop
thurston
thought
it
was
a
wreck
until
out
ahead
came
the
sharp
crackling
of
rifles
a
passenger
behind
him
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
a
bullet
shattered
the
glass
above
his
head
he
drew
back
hastily
some
one
hurried
through
the
front
vestibule
the
door
was
pushed
unceremoniously
open
and
a
man
a
giant
he
seemed
to
thurston
stopped
just
inside
glared
down
the
length
of
the
coach
through
slits
in
the
black
cloth
over
his
face
and
bawled
up
thurston
was
so
utterly
surprised
that
his
hands
jerked
themselves
involuntarily
above
his
head
though
he
did
not
feel
particularly
frightened
he
was
filled
with
a
stupefied
sort
of
curiosity
to
know
what
would
come
next
the
coach
so
far
as
he
could
see
seemed
filled
with
uplifted
trembling
hands
so
that
he
did
not
feel
ashamed
of
his
own
the
man
behind
him
put
up
his
hands
with
the
other
but
one
of
them
held
a
revolver
that
barked
savagely
and
unexpectedly
close
against
the
car
of
thurston
thurston
ducked
there
was
an
echo
from
the
front
and
the
man
behind
who
risked
so
much
on
one
shot
lurched
into
the
aisle
swaying
uncertainly
between
the
seats
he
of
the
mask
fired
again
viciously
and
the
other
collapsed
into
a
still
awkwardly
huddled
heap
on
the
floor
the
revolver
dropped
from
his
fingers
and
struck
against
thurston
foot
making
him
wince
thurston
had
never
before
seen
death
come
to
a
man
and
the
very
suddenness
of
it
unnerved
him
all
his
faculties
were
numbed
before
that
terrible
pitiless
form
in
the
door
and
the
limp
dead
body
at
his
feet
in
the
aisle
he
did
not
even
remember
that
here
was
the
savage
local
color
he
had
come
far
he
quite
forgot
to
improve
the
opportunity
by
making
mental
note
of
all
the
little
convincing
details
as
was
his
wont
presently
he
awoke
to
the
realization
of
certain
words
spoken
insistently
close
beside
him
he
turned
his
eyes
and
saw
that
the
girl
her
eyes
staring
straight
before
her
her
slim
brown
hands
uplifted
was
yet
commanding
him
imperiously
her
voice
holding
to
that
murmuring
monotone
more
discreet
than
a
whisper
gun
drop
down
and
get
it
he
ca
see
to
shoot
for
the
seat
in
front
get
the
gun
get
the
gun
was
what
she
was
saying
thurston
looked
at
her
helplessly
imploringly
in
truth
he
had
never
fired
a
gun
in
all
his
peaceful
life
gun
get
it
and
shoot
her
eyes
moved
quickly
in
a
cautious
glance
that
commanded
impatiently
her
straight
eyebrows
drew
together
imperiously
then
when
he
met
her
eyes
with
that
same
helpless
look
she
said
another
word
that
hurt
it
was
thurston
looked
down
at
the
gun
and
at
the
huddled
form
a
tiny
river
of
blood
was
creeping
toward
him
already
it
had
reached
his
foot
and
his
shoe
was
red
along
the
sole
he
moved
his
foot
quickly
away
from
it
and
shuddered
murmured
the
girl
contemptuously
again
and
a
splotch
of
anger
showed
under
the
tan
of
her
cheek
thurston
caught
his
breath
and
wondered
if
he
could
do
it
he
looked
toward
the
door
and
thought
how
far
it
was
to
send
a
bullet
straight
when
a
man
has
never
in
all
his
life
fired
a
gun
and
without
looking
he
could
see
that
horrible
red
stream
creeping
toward
him
like
some
monster
in
a
nightmare
his
flesh
crimpled
with
physical
repulsion
but
he
meant
to
try
perhaps
he
could
shoot
the
man
in
the
mask
so
that
there
would
be
another
huddled
lifeless
thing
on
the
floor
and
another
creeping
red
stream
at
that
instant
the
young
fellow
beside
the
girl
gathered
himself
for
a
spring
flung
himself
headlong
before
her
and
into
the
aisle
caught
the
dead
man
pistol
from
the
floor
and
fired
seemingly
with
one
movement
then
he
sprang
up
still
firing
as
fast
as
the
trigger
could
move
from
the
door
came
answer
shot
for
shot
and
the
car
was
filled
with
the
stifling
odor
of
burnt
powder
a
woman
screamed
hysterically
then
a
puff
of
cool
prairie
breeze
came
in
through
the
shattered
window
behind
thurston
and
the
lifted
like
a
curtain
blown
upward
in
the
wind
the
young
fellow
was
walking
coolly
down
the
aisle
the
smoking
revolver
pointing
like
an
accusing
finger
toward
the
outlaw
who
lay
stretched
upon
his
face
his
fingers
twitching
outside
rifles
were
crackling
like
corn
in
a
giant
popper
presently
it
slackened
to
an
occasional
shot
a
brakeman
followed
by
two
coatless
with
winchesters
ran
down
the
length
of
the
train
calling
out
that
there
was
no
danger
the
thud
of
their
running
feet
and
the
wholesome
mingling
of
their
shouting
struck
sharply
in
the
silence
after
the
shooting
one
of
the
men
swung
up
on
the
steps
of
the
day
coach
and
came
in
park
he
cried
to
the
tawny
haired
boy
one
did
yuh
that
good
we
did
too
got
him
alive
think
uh
the
nerve
uh
that
wagner
bunch
to
go
up
against
a
train
in
broad
daylight
made
an
easy
getaway
too
except
the
feller
we
gloomed
in
the
express
car
this
one
dead
i
reckon
he
get
well
enough
to
stretch
a
rope
he
killed
a
man
in
he
motioned
toward
the
huddled
figure
in
the
aisle
they
came
together
lifted
the
dead
man
and
carried
him
away
to
the
baggage
car
a
brakeman
came
with
a
cloth
and
wiped
up
the
red
pool
and
thurston
pressed
his
lips
tightly
together
and
turned
away
his
head
he
could
not
remember
when
the
sight
of
anything
had
made
him
so
deathly
sick
once
he
glanced
slyly
at
the
girl
opposite
and
saw
that
she
was
very
white
under
her
tan
and
that
the
hands
in
her
lap
were
clasped
tightly
and
yet
shook
but
she
met
his
eyes
squarely
and
thurston
did
not
look
at
her
again
he
did
not
like
the
expression
of
her
mouth
news
of
the
holdup
had
been
telegraphed
ahead
and
all
shellanne
which
was
not
much
of
a
crowd
gathered
at
the
station
to
meet
the
train
and
congratulate
the
heroes
thurston
alighted
almost
shamefacedly
into
the
midst
of
the
commotion
while
he
was
looking
uncertainly
about
him
wondering
where
to
go
and
what
to
do
a
voice
he
knew
hailed
him
with
drawling
welcome
bud
got
back
quicker
than
you
expected
did
yuh
it
lucky
i
happened
to
be
in
town
yuh
can
ride
out
with
me
say
yuh
got
quite
a
bunch
uh
local
color
for
a
story
did
yuh
you
be
writing
for
a
month
on
the
strength
of
this
little
episode
i
his
twinkling
eyes
teased
though
his
face
was
quite
serious
as
was
his
voice
she
of
the
eyes
turned
and
measured
thurston
with
a
deliberate
leisurely
glance
and
her
mouth
still
had
that
unpleasant
expression
thurston
colored
guiltily
but
hank
graves
lifted
his
hat
and
called
her
mona
and
asked
her
if
she
was
scared
stiff
and
if
she
were
home
to
stay
then
he
beckoned
to
the
fellow
with
his
finger
and
winked
at
mona
a
proceeding
which
shocked
thurston
considerably
here
hold
on
a
minute
ca
yuh
mona
this
is
a
friend
uh
mine
bud
thurston
his
name
he
come
out
to
study
us
up
and
round
up
a
hunch
uh
real
western
atmosphere
he
a
i
used
to
whack
bulls
all
over
the
country
with
his
father
bud
this
is
mona
stevens
she
ranges
down
close
to
the
lazy
eight
so
the
sooner
yuh
git
acquainted
the
he
did
not
explain
what
would
be
the
quicker
and
thurston
embarrassment
was
only
aggravated
by
the
introduction
miss
stevens
gave
him
a
chilly
smile
the
kind
that
is
worse
than
none
at
all
and
turned
her
back
thinly
pretending
that
she
heard
her
brother
calling
her
which
she
did
not
her
brother
was
loudly
explaining
what
would
have
happened
if
he
had
been
on
that
train
and
had
got
a
whack
at
the
robbers
and
his
sister
was
far
from
his
mind
graves
slapped
the
shoulder
of
the
fellow
they
had
called
park
young
devil
next
time
i
leave
the
place
for
a
week
yes
or
overnight
i
lock
yuh
up
in
the
blacksmith
shop
have
yuh
got
to
be
mona
special
escort
these
days
i
was
park
retorted
unmoved
here
yuh
ai
much
account
as
it
is
bud
this
here
my
park
holloway
one
of
that
is
i
going
to
turn
yuh
over
to
him
and
let
him
wise
yuh
up
say
you
young
bucks
ought
to
get
along
together
pretty
smooth
your
dads
run
buffalo
together
before
either
of
yuh
was
born
well
let
be
moving
we
ai
home
yet
got
a
bud
late
that
night
thurston
lay
upon
a
bed
and
listened
to
the
frogs
croaking
monotonously
in
the
hollow
behind
the
house
and
to
the
lone
coyote
which
harped
upon
the
subject
of
his
wrongs
away
on
a
distant
hillside
and
to
the
subdued
snoring
of
hank
graves
in
the
room
beyond
he
was
trying
to
adjust
himself
to
this
new
condition
of
things
and
the
new
condition
refused
utterly
to
be
measured
by
his
accepted
standard
according
to
that
standard
he
should
feel
repulsed
and
annoyed
by
the
familiarity
of
strangers
who
persisted
in
calling
him
without
taking
the
trouble
to
find
out
whether
or
not
he
liked
it
and
what
puzzled
thurston
and
put
him
all
at
sea
was
the
consciousness
that
he
did
like
it
and
that
it
struck
familiarly
upon
his
ears
as
something
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
in
the
past
also
according
to
his
past
he
should
hate
this
raw
life
and
rawer
country
where
could
occur
such
brutal
things
as
he
had
that
day
witnessed
he
should
dislike
a
man
like
park
holloway
who
having
wounded
a
man
unto
death
had
calmly
dismissed
the
subject
with
the
regret
that
his
aim
had
not
been
better
so
that
he
could
have
saved
the
county
the
expense
of
trying
and
hanging
the
fellow
thurston
was
amazed
to
find
that
down
in
the
inner
man
of
him
he
admired
park
holloway
exceedingly
and
privately
resolved
to
perfect
himself
in
the
use
of
he
who
had
been
wont
to
deplore
the
thinly
veneered
savagery
of
men
who
liked
such
things
after
much
speculation
he
decided
that
mona
stevens
would
not
do
for
a
kidnapped
heroine
he
could
not
seem
to
her
in
such
a
position
and
besides
he
told
himself
that
such
a
type
of
girl
did
not
attract
him
at
all
she
had
called
him
a
coward
and
why
simply
because
he
straight
from
the
trammels
of
civilization
had
not
been
prepared
to
meet
the
situation
thrust
upon
she
had
thrust
upon
him
she
had
demanded
of
him
something
he
had
not
the
power
to
accomplish
and
she
had
called
him
a
coward
and
in
his
heart
thurston
knew
that
it
was
unjust
and
that
he
was
not
a
coward
chapter
iii
first
impressions
thurston
dressed
immaculately
in
riding
clothes
of
the
latest
english
cut
went
airily
down
the
stairs
and
discovered
that
he
was
not
early
as
he
had
imagined
seven
he
had
told
himself
proudly
was
not
bad
for
a
beginner
and
he
had
smiled
in
anticipation
of
hank
surprise
which
was
fortunate
since
he
would
otherwise
have
been
cheated
of
smiling
at
all
for
hank
graves
he
learned
from
the
cook
had
eaten
breakfast
at
five
and
had
left
the
ranch
more
than
an
hour
before
the
men
also
were
scattered
to
their
work
properly
humbled
in
spirit
he
sat
down
to
the
kitchen
table
and
ate
his
belated
breakfast
while
the
cook
kneaded
bread
at
the
other
end
of
the
same
table
and
eyed
thurston
with
frank
amusement
thurston
had
never
before
been
conscious
of
feeling
ill
at
ease
in
the
presence
of
a
servant
and
hurried
through
the
meal
so
that
he
could
escape
into
the
clear
sunshine
feeling
a
bit
foolish
in
the
unaccustomed
bagginess
of
his
riding
breeches
and
the
snugness
of
his
leggings
for
he
had
never
taken
to
outdoor
sports
except
as
an
onlooker
from
the
shade
of
a
grand
stand
or
piazza
while
he
was
debating
the
wisdom
of
writing
a
detailed
description
of
yesterday
tragedy
while
it
was
still
fresh
in
his
mind
and
stowing
it
away
for
future
park
holloway
rode
into
the
yard
and
on
to
the
stables
he
nodded
at
thurston
and
grinned
without
apparent
cause
as
the
cook
had
done
thurston
followed
him
to
the
corral
and
watched
him
pull
the
saddle
off
his
horse
and
throw
it
carelessly
to
one
side
it
looked
cumbersome
that
saddle
quite
unlike
the
ones
he
had
inspected
in
the
new
york
shops
he
grasped
the
horn
lifted
upon
it
and
said
ai
it
park
laughed
and
slipped
the
bridle
down
over
the
ears
of
his
horse
and
dismissed
him
with
a
slap
on
the
rump
yuh
like
the
looks
of
it
he
added
indulgently
thurston
engaged
in
wondering
what
all
those
little
strings
were
for
felt
the
indulgence
and
straightened
should
i
know
he
retorted
can
see
that
my
ignorance
is
absolute
i
expect
you
to
laugh
at
me
me
park
said
he
of
the
tawny
hair
and
leaned
against
the
fence
looking
extremely
boyish
and
utterly
incapable
of
walking
calmly
down
upon
a
barking
revolver
and
shooting
as
he
went
bound
to
learn
all
about
saddles
and
what
they
made
for
he
went
on
long
as
yuh
do
get
the
first
time
yuh
stick
on
a
horse
that
a
little
or
back
down
from
a
few
hard
knocks
you
be
all
thurston
had
not
intended
getting
out
and
actually
living
the
life
he
had
come
to
observe
but
something
got
in
his
nerves
and
his
blood
and
bred
an
impulse
to
which
he
yielded
without
reserve
see
here
he
said
eagerly
said
he
turn
me
over
to
you
so
you
could
er
teach
me
wisdom
it
deuced
rough
on
you
but
i
hope
you
wo
refuse
to
be
bothered
with
me
i
want
to
learn
everything
and
i
want
you
to
find
fault
like
the
mischief
and
er
knock
me
into
shape
if
it
he
was
very
modest
over
his
ignorance
and
his
voice
rang
true
park
studied
him
gravely
he
said
at
last
do
greener
right
now
than
a
meadow
in
june
but
yuh
got
the
right
stuff
in
yuh
and
it
a
go
with
me
you
come
along
with
us
after
that
and
you
get
knocked
into
shape
fast
enough
smoke
thurston
shook
his
head
dunno
i
afraid
yuh
ca
be
the
real
thing
unless
yuh
fan
your
lungs
with
cigarette
smoke
the
twinkle
belied
him
though
where
did
you
pick
them
bloomers
were
made
in
new
thurston
smiled
in
sickly
fashion
he
had
all
along
been
uncomfortably
aware
of
the
sharp
contrast
between
his
own
modish
attire
and
the
somewhat
disreputable
leathern
chaps
of
his
foreman
commented
park
told
me
to
find
fault
like
the
mischief
and
i
going
to
call
your
bluff
this
here
montana
recollect
and
i
raise
the
long
howl
over
them
habiliments
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
pace
along
to
the
house
and
discard
before
the
boys
get
sight
of
yuh
they
queer
yuh
with
the
whole
outfit
sure
uh
course
he
went
on
soothingly
when
he
saw
the
resentment
in
thurston
eyes
expect
they
real
stylish
back
east
but
the
boys
ai
educated
to
stand
for
anything
like
that
they
likely
tell
yuh
they
set
like
the
hide
on
the
hind
legs
of
an
elephant
which
is
a
fact
i
hate
to
say
it
kid
but
they
sure
do
look
like
the
would
you
in
new
york
thurston
flung
back
at
him
sure
but
this
ai
new
york
this
here
the
lazy
eight
corral
and
i
doing
yuh
a
favor
you
would
like
to
have
the
boys
shooting
holes
through
the
slack
would
yuh
you
amble
right
along
and
get
some
pants
on
and
when
you
wised
up
some
you
thank
me
a
lot
i
going
on
a
little
jaunt
down
the
creek
before
dinner
and
you
might
go
along
you
need
to
get
hardened
to
the
saddle
anyway
before
we
start
for
billings
or
you
do
most
uh
riding
on
the
thurston
albeit
in
resentful
mood
went
meekly
and
did
as
he
was
commanded
to
do
and
no
man
save
park
and
the
cook
ever
glimpsed
those
smart
riding
clothes
of
english
cut
yuh
look
a
heap
more
human
was
the
way
park
signified
his
approval
of
the
change
a
little
horse
that
easy
to
ride
and
dead
gentle
if
yuh
do
spur
him
in
the
neck
which
you
ai
liable
to
do
at
present
and
hank
says
you
can
have
this
saddle
for
keeps
hank
used
to
ride
it
but
he
it
and
got
one
longer
in
the
seat
when
we
start
for
billings
to
trail
up
them
cattle
of
course
you
get
a
string
of
your
own
to
string
i
afraid
i
do
quite
do
savvy
riding
a
string
a
string
is
ten
or
a
dozen
that
yuh
ride
turn
about
and
nobody
else
has
got
any
right
to
top
one
every
fellow
has
got
his
own
string
yuh
thurston
eyed
his
horse
distrustfully
think
he
ventured
will
be
enough
for
me
i
scarcely
need
a
the
truth
was
that
he
thought
park
was
laughing
at
him
park
slid
sidewise
in
the
saddle
and
proceeded
to
roll
another
cigarette
be
willing
to
bet
that
by
fall
you
have
a
string
rode
down
to
a
whisper
you
wait
wait
till
it
gets
in
your
blood
why
i
die
if
you
took
me
off
the
range
wait
till
yuh
set
out
in
the
dark
on
your
horse
and
count
the
stars
and
watch
the
big
dipper
swing
around
towards
morning
and
listen
to
the
cattle
breathing
close
by
sleeping
while
you
ride
around
playing
guardian
angel
over
their
dreams
wait
till
yuh
get
up
at
daybreak
and
are
in
the
saddle
with
the
pink
uh
sunrise
and
know
you
sleep
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
from
there
that
night
and
yuh
lay
down
at
night
with
the
smell
of
new
grass
in
your
nostrils
where
your
bed
had
bruised
it
bud
if
you
a
man
you
be
plumb
spoiled
for
your
little
old
then
he
swung
back
his
feet
and
the
horses
broke
into
a
lope
which
jarred
the
unaccustomed
frame
of
thurston
mightily
though
he
kept
the
pace
doggedly
got
to
go
down
to
the
stevens
place
park
informed
him
met
mona
yesterday
it
was
her
come
down
on
the
train
with
me
yuh
thurston
did
remember
very
distinctly
says
yuh
compose
stories
is
that
right
thurston
mind
came
back
from
wondering
how
mona
stevens
mouth
looked
when
she
was
pleased
with
one
and
he
nodded
there
a
lot
in
this
country
that
ai
ever
been
wrote
about
i
guess
at
least
if
it
was
i
never
read
it
and
i
read
considerable
but
the
trouble
is
them
that
know
ai
in
the
writing
business
and
them
that
write
do
know
the
way
i
figured
it
they
set
back
east
somewhere
and
write
it
like
they
think
maybe
it
is
and
it
a
hell
of
a
job
they
make
of
thurston
remembering
the
time
when
he
too
back
and
wrote
it
like
he
thought
maybe
it
was
blushed
guiltily
he
was
thankful
that
his
stories
of
the
west
had
without
exception
been
rejected
as
of
little
worth
he
shuddered
to
think
of
one
of
them
falling
into
the
hands
of
park
holloway
came
out
to
learn
and
i
want
to
learn
it
thoroughly
he
said
in
the
face
of
much
physical
discomfort
just
then
the
horses
slowed
for
a
climb
and
he
breathed
thanks
the
first
place
he
began
again
when
he
had
readjusted
himself
carefully
in
the
saddle
wish
you
tell
me
just
where
you
are
going
with
the
wagons
and
what
you
mean
by
trailing
a
i
thought
i
said
we
were
going
to
billings
park
answered
surprised
we
going
to
do
when
we
get
there
is
to
receive
a
shipment
of
cattle
young
steer
that
coming
up
from
the
panhandle
which
is
a
part
uh
texas
and
we
trail
up
here
and
turn
loose
this
side
the
river
after
that
we
start
the
calf
roundup
the
lazy
eight
runs
two
wagons
yuh
know
i
run
one
and
deacon
smith
runs
the
other
we
work
together
though
most
of
the
time
it
makes
quite
a
crew
or
thirty
did
know
said
thurston
dubiously
you
ever
shipped
cattle
into
this
country
i
supposed
you
shipped
them
out
is
graves
buying
some
i
guess
yes
six
thousand
head
uh
yearlings
and
two
this
spring
some
seasons
it
more
we
get
in
young
stock
every
year
and
turn
loose
on
the
range
till
they
ready
to
ship
it
cheaper
than
raising
calves
yuh
know
when
yuh
get
to
billings
bud
you
see
some
cattle
why
our
bunch
alone
will
make
seven
trains
and
that
a
commencement
cattle
cheap
down
south
this
year
and
seems
like
everybody
buying
hank
did
buy
as
much
as
some
because
he
runs
quite
a
bunch
uh
cows
we
brand
six
or
seven
thousand
calves
this
spring
hank
sure
knows
how
to
rake
in
the
thurston
agreed
as
politely
as
he
could
for
the
jolting
they
had
again
struck
the
level
and
seven
miles
at
park
usual
pace
was
heartbreaking
to
a
man
not
accustomed
to
the
saddle
thurston
had
written
just
before
leaving
home
a
musical
bit
of
verse
born
of
his
luring
dreams
about
joy
of
speeding
fleetly
where
the
grassland
meets
the
sky
and
he
was
gritting
his
teeth
now
over
the
idiotic
lines
when
they
reached
the
ranch
and
mona
mother
came
to
the
door
and
invited
them
in
he
declined
almost
rudely
for
he
had
a
feeling
that
once
out
of
the
saddle
he
would
have
difficulty
in
getting
into
it
again
besides
mona
was
not
at
home
according
to
her
mother
so
they
did
not
tarry
and
thurston
reached
the
lazy
eight
alive
but
with
the
glamour
quite
gone
from
his
west
if
he
had
not
been
the
son
of
his
father
he
would
have
taken
the
first
train
which
pointed
its
nose
to
the
east
and
he
would
never
again
have
essayed
the
writing
of
western
stories
or
musical
verse
which
sung
the
joys
of
galloping
blithely
off
to
the
he
had
just
been
galloping
off
to
a
that
was
always
just
before
and
he
had
not
been
blithe
nor
did
the
memory
of
it
charm
of
a
truth
the
very
thought
of
things
western
made
him
swear
mild
oaths
he
choked
back
his
awe
of
the
cook
and
asked
him
quite
humbly
what
was
good
to
take
the
soreness
from
one
muscles
afterward
he
had
crept
painfully
up
the
stairs
clasping
to
his
bosom
a
beer
bottle
filled
with
pungent
liniment
which
the
cook
had
gravely
declared
uh
sight
for
hank
graves
when
he
heard
the
story
with
artistic
touches
from
the
cook
slapped
his
thigh
and
laughed
one
of
his
soundless
chuckles
he
the
right
stuff
never
whined
eh
i
knew
it
his
dad
over
again
from
the
ground
and
loved
him
the
better
chapter
iv
the
thurston
tucked
the
bulb
of
his
camera
down
beside
the
bellows
and
closed
the
box
with
a
snap
wonder
what
old
reeve
would
say
to
that
view
he
mused
aloud
who
a
fellow
back
in
new
york
jove
he
throw
up
his
heads
and
take
to
oils
and
landscapes
if
he
could
see
the
was
a
panoramic
view
of
the
town
and
surrounding
valley
of
billings
the
day
was
sunlit
and
still
and
far
objects
stood
up
with
sharp
outlines
in
the
clear
atmosphere
here
and
there
the
white
tents
of
waiting
splotched
the
bright
green
of
the
prairie
horsemen
galloped
to
and
from
the
town
at
top
speed
and
a
long
grimy
red
stock
train
had
just
snorted
out
on
a
siding
by
the
stockyards
where
the
bellowing
of
thirsty
cattle
came
faintly
like
the
roar
of
pounding
surf
in
the
distance
thurston
quite
a
different
thurston
from
the
trim
pale
young
man
who
had
followed
the
lure
of
the
west
two
weeks
before
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
out
over
the
hurrying
waters
of
the
yellowstone
it
was
good
to
be
alive
and
young
and
to
live
the
tented
life
of
the
plains
it
was
good
even
to
be
fleetly
where
the
grassland
meets
the
sky
for
two
weeks
in
the
saddle
had
changed
considerably
his
he
turned
again
to
the
dust
and
roar
of
the
stockyards
a
mile
or
so
away
he
remarked
hopefully
next
train
will
be
strange
how
soon
a
man
may
identify
himself
with
new
conditions
and
new
aims
he
had
come
west
to
look
upon
the
life
from
the
outside
and
now
his
chief
thought
was
of
the
coming
steers
which
he
referred
to
unblushingly
as
such
is
the
spell
of
the
range
ride
on
over
bud
park
proposed
likely
the
circle
bar
shipment
their
bunch
comes
from
the
same
place
ours
does
and
i
want
to
see
how
they
stack
thurston
agreed
and
went
to
saddle
up
he
had
mastered
the
art
of
saddling
and
could
on
lucky
days
and
when
he
was
in
what
he
called
rope
the
horse
he
wanted
to
say
nothing
of
the
times
when
his
loop
settled
unexpectedly
over
the
wrong
victim
park
holloway
for
instance
who
once
got
it
neatly
under
his
chin
much
to
his
disgust
and
the
astonishment
of
thurston
going
to
take
my
kodak
said
he
like
to
watch
them
unload
and
i
can
get
some
good
pictures
with
this
you
hollered
up
and
down
the
chutes
as
many
times
as
i
have
park
told
him
wo
need
no
pictures
to
help
yuh
remember
what
it
it
was
an
old
story
with
park
and
thurston
enthusiasm
struck
him
as
a
bit
funny
he
perched
upon
a
corner
of
the
fence
out
of
the
way
and
smoked
cigarettes
while
he
watched
the
cattle
and
shouted
pleasantries
to
the
men
who
prodded
and
swore
and
gesticulated
at
the
huddle
in
the
pens
soon
his
turn
would
come
but
just
now
he
was
content
to
look
on
and
take
his
ease
the
life
of
me
cried
thurston
sidling
gingerly
over
to
him
ca
see
where
they
all
come
from
for
two
days
these
yards
have
never
been
empty
the
country
will
soon
be
one
vast
days
huh
this
thing
go
on
for
weeks
and
after
all
is
over
you
wonder
where
the
dickens
they
all
went
to
montana
is
some
bigger
than
you
realize
i
guess
and
next
fall
when
shipping
starts
you
think
you
seeing
raw
porterhouse
steaks
for
the
whole
world
let
drift
out
uh
this
dust
you
have
time
to
get
a
carload
uh
pictures
before
our
bunch
rolls
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
two
weeks
before
the
lazy
eight
consignment
arrived
thurston
haunted
the
stockyards
with
his
kodak
but
after
the
first
two
or
three
days
he
took
no
pictures
for
every
day
was
but
a
repetition
of
those
that
had
gone
before
a
great
grimy
engine
shunting
cars
back
and
forth
on
the
siding
an
endless
stream
of
weary
young
cattle
flowing
down
the
steep
chutes
into
the
pens
from
the
pens
to
the
branding
chutes
where
they
were
burned
deep
with
the
mark
of
their
new
owners
then
out
through
the
great
gate
crowding
pushing
wild
to
flee
from
restraint
yet
held
in
and
guided
by
mounted
cowboys
out
upon
the
green
prairie
where
they
could
feast
once
more
upon
sweet
grasses
and
drink
their
fill
from
the
river
of
clear
mountain
water
out
upon
the
weary
march
of
the
trail
on
and
on
for
long
days
until
some
boundary
which
their
drivers
hailed
with
joy
was
passed
and
they
were
free
at
last
to
roam
at
will
over
the
range
land
to
lie
down
in
some
cool
swale
and
chew
their
cuds
in
peace
two
weeks
and
then
came
a
telegram
for
park
in
the
reading
of
it
he
shuffled
off
his
attitude
of
boyish
irresponsibility
and
became
in
a
breath
the
cool
leader
of
men
holding
the
envelope
still
in
his
hand
he
sought
out
thurston
who
was
practicing
with
a
rope
as
park
approached
him
he
whirled
the
noose
and
cast
it
neatly
over
the
peak
of
the
teepee
shot
park
encouraged
i
advise
yuh
to
take
another
target
you
have
the
tent
down
over
scotty
ears
and
then
think
yuh
stirred
up
a
mess

hornets

our
cattle
are
coming
and
i
going
to
be

if
you
like
a

on
and
take
chances
on

appeal
to
yuh
but
i
willing
to
throw
in
heaps
uh
valuable
experience
that
wo
cost

a
he
lowered
an
eyelid
toward
the
although
no
one
was
visible
thurston
studied
the
matter
while
he
coiled
his
rope
and
no
longer
secretly
he
had
wanted
all
along
to
be
a
part
of
the
life
instead
of
an
onlooker
take
the
job
park
if
you
think
i
can
hold
it
the
speech
would
doubtless
have
astonished
in
more
ways
than
one
but
was
already
a
part
of
the
past
in
mind
he
was
for
living
the
present
park
retorted
be
your
own
funeral
if
yuh
get
fired
better
stake
yourself
to
a
pair
uh
chaps
you
need
on
the
a
large
silk
handkerchief
if
i
want
to
look

part
thurston
bantered
yuh
do
want
your
darned
neck
blistered
yuh
mean
park
flung
over
his
shoulders
wages
and
schooling
start
in
at
it
was
early
in
the
morning
when
the
first
train
arrived
hungry
thirsty
tired
bawling
a
general
protest
against
fate
and
man
mode
of
travel
thurston
with
a
long
pole
in
his
hand
stood
on
the
narrow
plank
near
the
top
of
a
chute
wall
and
prodded
vaguely
at
an
endless
moving
incline
of
backs
incidentally
he
took
his
cue
from
his
neighbors
and
shouted
till
his
voice
was
a
he
could
not
see
that
he
accomplished
anything
either
by
his
prodding
or
his
shouting
below
him
surged
the
sea
of
hide
and
horns
which
was
barely
suggestive
of
the
animals
as
individuals
out
in
the
corrals
the
hung
low
just
as
it
had
hovered
every
day
for
more
than
two
weeks
just
as
it
would
hover
every
day
for
two
weeks
longer
across
the
yards
near
the
big
outer
gate
deacon
smith
crew
was
already
beginning
to
brand
the
first
train
was
barely
unloaded
when
the
second
trailed
in
and
out
on
the
siding
and
so
the
third
came
also
then
came
a
lull
for
the
consignment
had
been
split
in
two
and
the
second
section
was
several
hours
behind
the
first
thurston
rode
out
to
camp
aching
with
the
strain
and
ravenously
hungry
after
toiling
with
his
muscles
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
for
his
had
been
days
of
physical
ease
he
had
yet
to
learn
the
art
of
working
so
that
every
movement
counted
something
accomplished
as
did
the
others
besides
he
had
been
in
constant
fear
of
losing
his
hold
on
the
fence
and
plunging
headlong
amongst
the
trampling
hoofs
below
a
fate
that
he
shuddered
to
contemplate
he
did
not
however
mention
that
fear
or
his
muscle
ache
to
any
man
he
might
be
green
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
whine
when
he
went
back
into
the
dust
and
roar
park
ordered
him
curtly
to
tend
the
branding
fire
since
both
crews
would
brand
that
afternoon
and
get
the
corrals
cleared
for
the
next
shipment
thurston
thanked
park
mentally
tending
sounded
very
much
like
child
play
soon
the
gray
took
on
a
shade
of
blue
in
places
where
the
smoke
from
the
fires
cut
through
a
new
tang
smote
the
nostrils
the
rank
odor
of
burning
hair
and
searing
hides
a
new
note
crept
into
the
clamoring
roar
the
blat
of
pain
and
fright
thurston
turned
away
his
head
from
the
sight
and
the
smell
and
piled
on
wood
until
park
stopped
him
with
bud
we
ai
celebrating
any
election
it
ai
a
bonfire
we
want
it
heat
just
keep
her
going
and
save
wood
all
yuh
after
an
hour
of
thurston
decided
that
there
were
things
more
wearisome
than
down
the
his
eyes
were
smarting
intolerably
with
smoke
and
heat
and
the
smell
of
the
branding
was
not
nice
but
through
the
long
afternoon
he
stuck
to
the
work
shrewdly
guessing
that
the
others
were
not
having
any
fun
either
park
and
worked
as
hard
as
any
branding
the
steers
as
they
were
squeezed
one
by
one
fast
in
the
little
branding
chutes
the
setting
sun
shone
redly
through
the
smoke
before
thurston
was
free
to
kick
the
sticks
apart
and
pour
water
upon
them
as
directed
by
park
yuh
earned
your
little
old
dollar
and
thirty
three
cents
bud
park
asked
him
and
thurston
smiled
a
tired
sooty
smile
that
seemed
all
teeth
hope
so
at
any
rate
i
have
a
deep
inner
knowledge
of
the
joys
of
branding
yuh
burn
lazy
eights
on
wriggling
blatting
calves
for
two
or
three
hours
at
a
stretch
before
yuh
talk
about
the
joys
uh
park
rubbed
eloquently
his
aching
biceps
at
dusk
thurston
crept
into
his
blankets
feeling
that
he
would
like
the
night
to
be
at
least
thirty
six
hours
long
he
was
just
settling
into
a
luxurious
dream
chair
preparatory
to
telling
his
western
experiences
when
park
voice
bellowed
into
the
tent
out
boys
we
got
a
train
pulling
in
there
was
hurried
dressing
in
the
dark
of
the
hasty
mounting
and
a
hastier
ride
through
the
cool
night
air
there
were
long
hours
at
the
chutes
prodding
down
at
a
wavering
line
of
moving
shadows
while
the
hung
bright
in
the
sky
and
lighted
lanterns
bobbed
back
and
forth
along
the
train
waving
signals
to
one
another
at
intervals
park
voice
cut
crisply
through
the
turmoil
giving
orders
to
men
whom
he
could
not
see
the
east
was
lightening
to
a
pale
yellow
when
the
men
climbed
at
last
into
their
saddles
and
galloped
out
to
camp
for
a
hurried
breakfast
thurston
had
been
comforting
his
aching
body
with
the
promise
of
rest
and
sleep
but
three
thousand
cattle
were
milling
impatiently
in
the
stockyards
so
presently
he
found
himself
fanning
a
sickly
little
blaze
with
his
hat
while
he
endeavored
to
keep
the
smoke
from
his
tired
eyes
of
a
truth
would
have
stared
mightily
at
sight
of
him
once
park
passing
by
smiled
down
upon
him
grimly
where
yuh
get
the
real
thing
in
local
color
he
taunted
but
thurston
was
too
busy
to
answer
the
stress
of
living
had
dimmed
his
eye
for
the
picturesque
that
night
one
philip
thurston
slept
as
sleeps
the
dead
but
he
awoke
with
the
others
and
thanked
the
lord
there
were
no
more
cattle
to
unload
and
brand
when
he
went
out
on
that
afternoon
he
fancied
that
he
was
getting
into
the
midst
of
things
and
taking
his
place
with
the
veterans
he
would
have
been
filled
with
resentment
had
he
suspected
the
truth
that
park
carefully
eased
those
first
days
of
his
novitiate
that
was
why
none
of
the
fell
to
him
until
they
had
left
billings
many
miles
behind
them
chapter
the
storm
the
third
night
he
was
detailed
to
stand
with
bob
macgregor
on
the
middle
guard
which
lasts
from
eleven
until
two
the
outfit
had
camped
near
the
head
of
a
long
shallow
basin
that
had
a
creek
running
through
down
the
winding
banks
of
it
lay
the
camps
of
seven
other
the
cattle
making
great
brown
blotches
against
the
green
at
sundown
thurston
hoped
they
would
all
be
there
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
came
up
so
that
he
could
get
a
picture
they
be
miles
away
by
then
bob
assured
him
unfeelingly
the
signs
you
can
take
by
lightning
in
another
hour
got
your
slicker
bud
thurston
said
he
had
and
bob
shook
his
head
prophetically
sure
wish
yuh
had
it
before
yuh
hit
camp
again
when
yuh
get
wise
you
ride
with
your
slicker
behind
the
cantle
rain
or
shine
need
singing
to
thurston
prudently
kept
silent
since
he
knew
nothing
whatever
about
it
and
bob
gave
him
minute
directions
about
riding
his
rounds
and
how
to
turn
a
stray
animal
back
into
the
herd
without
disturbing
the
others
the
man
they
relieved
met
them
silently
and
rode
away
to
camp
off
to
the
right
an
animal
coughed
and
a
black
shape
moved
out
from
the
shadows
bob
swung
towards
it
and
the
shape
melted
again
into
the
splotch
of
shade
which
was
the
sleeping
herd
he
motioned
to
the
left
can
go
that
way
and
yuh
want
to
sing
something
or
whistle
so
they
know
what
yuh
his
tone
was
subdued
as
it
had
not
been
before
he
seemed
to
drift
away
into
the
darkness
and
soon
his
voice
rose
away
across
the
herd
singing
as
he
drew
nearer
thurston
caught
the
words
at
first
disjointed
and
indistinct
then
plainer
as
they
met
it
was
a
song
he
had
never
heard
before
because
its
first
popularity
had
swept
far
below
his
social
plane
a
bird
in
a
cage
a
beautiful
sight
to
you
may
think
she
seems
and
free
from
the
singer
passed
on
and
away
and
only
the
high
notes
floated
across
to
thurston
who
whistled
softly
under
his
breath
while
he
listened
then
as
they
neared
again
on
the
second
round
the
words
came
pensively
beauty
was
for
an
old
man
she
a
bird
in
a
gilded
thurston
rode
slowly
like
one
in
a
dream
and
the
lure
of
the
was
strong
upon
him
the
deep
breathing
of
three
thousand
sleeping
cattle
the
strong
animal
odor
the
black
night
which
grew
each
moment
blacker
and
the
rhythmic
ebb
and
flow
of
the
clear
untrained
voice
of
a
cowboy
singing
to
his
charge
if
he
could
put
it
into
words
if
he
could
but
picture
the
broody
stillness
with
frogs
along
the
reedy
and
a
coyote
yapping
weirdly
upon
a
distant
hilltop
from
the
southwest
came
mutterings
and
ominous
a
breeze
whispered
something
to
the
grasses
as
it
crept
away
down
the
valley
stood
in
a
just
at
while
the
sunset
adorned
the
it
was
bob
drawing
close
out
of
the
night
doing
fine
kid
keep
her
he
commended
in
an
undertone
as
he
passed
and
thurston
moistened
his
unaccustomed
lips
and
began
industriously
whistling
heart
bowed
down
and
from
that
jumped
to
faust
fifteen
minutes
exhausted
his
memory
of
the
whistleable
parts
and
he
was
not
given
to
tiresome
repetitions
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
bob
voice
chanted
admonishingly
from
somewhere
her
bud
old
boy
so
thurston
took
breath
and
began
on
holy
city
and
came
near
laughing
at
the
incongruity
of
the
song
only
he
remembered
that
he
must
not
frighten
the
cattle
and
checked
the
impulse
bob
began
when
he
came
near
enough
yuh
know
the
words
uh
that
piece
it
a
peach
i
wisht
you
sing
he
rode
on
still
humming
the
woes
of
the
lady
who
married
for
gold
thurston
obeyed
while
the
rumbled
deep
accompaniment
like
the
resonant
lower
tones
of
a
bass
viol
night
i
lay
there
came
a
dream
so
fair
i
stood
in
old
jerusalem
beside
the
temple
a
steer
stepped
restlessly
out
of
the
herd
and
thurston
horse
trained
to
the
work
of
his
own
accord
turned
him
gently
back
heard
the
children
singing
and
ever
as
they
sang
me
thought
the
voice
of
angels
from
heaven
in
answer
from
the
west
the
thunder
boomed
drowning
the
words
in
its
growl
jerusalem
lift
up
your
gates
and
her
up
a
little
faster
bud
or
we
lose
some
they
getting
on
their
feet
with
that
sunfish
in
answer
to
thurston
touch
on
the
reins
quickened
to
a
trot
the
joggling
was
not
conducive
to
the
best
vocal
expression
but
the
singer
persevered
in
the
highest
hosanna
to
your
king
flash
the
lightning
cut
through
the
and
bob
who
had
contented
himself
with
a
subdued
whistling
while
he
listened
took
up
the
refrain
it
was
as
if
a
battery
of
heavy
field
pieces
boomed
overhead
the
entire
herd
was
on
its
feet
and
stood
their
tails
to
the
coming
storm
now
the
horses
were
loping
steadily
in
their
endless
circling
a
pace
they
could
hold
for
hours
if
need
be
for
one
blinding
instant
thurston
saw
far
down
the
valley
then
the
black
curtain
dropped
as
suddenly
as
it
had
lifted
bud
came
the
command
and
after
it
bob
voice
trilled
high
above
the
in
the
hosanna
to
your
king
a
strange
thrill
of
excitement
came
to
thurston
it
was
all
new
to
him
for
his
life
had
been
sheltered
from
the
rages
of
nature
he
had
never
before
been
out
under
the
night
sky
when
it
was
threatening
as
now
he
flinched
when
came
an
crash
that
once
again
lifted
the
black
curtain
and
showed
him
the
plain
in
the
dark
that
followed
came
a
rhythmic
thud
of
hoofs
far
up
the
creek
and
the
rattle
of
living
castanets
sunfish
threw
up
his
head
and
listened
muscles
a
bunch
called
bob
from
across
the
frightened
herd
they
hit
us
give
sunfish
his
head
he
been
there
before
and
keep
on
the
outside
thurston
yelled
right
but
the
pounding
roar
of
the
stampede
drowned
his
voice
a
whirlwind
of
frenzied
steers
bore
down
upon
him
hundred
panhandle
though
he
did
not
know
it
then
his
mind
was
all
a
daze
with
one
sentence
zigzagging
through
it
like
the
lightning
over
his
head
sunfish
his
head
and
keep
on
the
outside
that
was
what
saved
him
for
he
had
the
sense
to
obey
after
a
few
minutes
of
breathless
racing
with
a
roar
as
of
breakers
in
his
ears
and
the
crackle
of
clashing
horns
and
the
gleaming
of
rolling
eyeballs
close
upon
his
horse
heels
he
found
himself
washed
high
and
dry
as
it
were
while
the
tumult
swept
by
presently
he
was
galloping
along
behind
and
wondering
dully
how
he
got
there
though
perhaps
sunfish
knew
well
enough
in
his
story
of
the
west
the
one
that
had
failed
to
be
convincing
he
had
in
his
ignorance
described
a
stampede
and
it
had
not
been
in
the
least
like
this
one
he
blushed
at
the
memory
and
wondered
if
he
should
ever
again
feel
qualified
to
write
of
these
things
great
drops
of
rain
pounded
him
on
the
back
as
he
rode
chill
drops
that
went
to
the
skin
he
thought
of
his
new
slicker
in
the
and
before
he
knew
it
swore
just
as
any
of
the
other
men
would
have
done
under
similar
provocation
it
was
the
first
real
oath
he
had
ever
uttered
he
was
becoming
assimilated
with
the
raw
conditions
of
life
he
heard
a
man
voice
calling
to
him
and
distinguished
the
dim
shape
of
a
rider
close
by
he
shouted
that
password
of
the
range
outfit
is
this
the
man
cried
again
lazy
eight
snapped
thurston
sure
that
the
other
had
come
with
the
stampede
then
feeling
the
anger
of
temporary
authority
in
hell
are
you
up
to
letting
your
cattle
run
if
park
could
have
heard
him
say
that
for
down
the
long
length
of
the
valley
they
swept
gathering
to
themselves
other
herds
and
other
riders
as
incensed
as
were
themselves
it
is
not
pretty
work
nor
amusing
to
gallop
madly
in
the
wake
of
a
stampede
at
night
keeping
up
the
stragglers
and
taking
the
chance
of
a
broken
neck
with
the
rain
to
make
matters
worse
bob
macgregor
sought
thurston
with
much
shouting
and
having
found
him
they
rode
side
by
side
and
always
the
thunder
boomed
overhead
and
by
the
lightning
flashes
they
glimpsed
the
turbulent
sea
of
cattle
fleeing
they
knew
not
where
or
why
with
blind
fear
crowding
their
heels
the
noise
of
it
roused
the
camps
as
they
thundered
by
men
rose
up
peered
out
from
as
the
stampede
swept
past
cursed
the
delay
it
would
probably
make
hoped
none
of
the
boys
got
hurt
and
thanked
the
lord
the
tents
were
pitched
close
to
the
creek
and
out
of
the
track
of
the
maddened
herds
then
they
went
back
to
bed
to
wait
philosophically
for
daylight
when
sunfish
between
flashes
stumbled
into
a
shallow
washout
and
sent
thurston
sailing
unbeautifully
over
his
head
bob
pulled
up
and
slid
off
his
horse
in
a
hurry
hurt
bud
he
cried
anxiously
bending
over
him
for
thurston
from
the
very
frankness
of
his
verdant
ignorance
had
won
for
himself
the
indulgent
protectiveness
of
the
whole
outfit
not
a
man
but
watched
unobtrusively
over
his
welfare
and
bob
macgregor
went
farther
and
loved
him
his
voice
when
he
spoke
was
unequivocally
frightened
thurston
sat
up
and
wiped
a
handful
of
mud
off
his
face
if
it
had
not
been
so
dark
bob
would
have
shouted
at
the
spectacle
sorter
shuck
up
like
he
quoted
ruefully
my
nose
is
skinned
thank
you
where
that
devil
of
a
horse
bob
stood
over
him
and
grinned
i
surprised
at
yuh
bud
what
would
your
teacher
say
if
she
heard
yuh
anyway
yuh
got
any
call
to
cuss
sunfish
he
ai
to
blame
he
used
to
fellows
that
can
up
thurston
commanded
inelegantly
like
to
see
you
ride
a
horse
when
he
upside
down
come
on
urged
bob
giving
up
the
argument
be
plumb
lost
from
the
herd
if
we
do
they
got
into
their
saddles
again
and
went
on
riding
by
sound
and
the
rare
glimpses
the
lightning
gave
them
as
it
flared
through
the
storm
away
to
the
east
bob
sung
out
sympathetically
from
the
streaming
shelter
of
his
slicker
thurston
wriggling
away
from
his
soaked
clothing
grunted
a
sarcastic
negative
the
cattle
were
drifting
now
before
the
storm
which
had
settled
to
a
monotonous
downpour
the
riders
two
or
three
men
for
every
herd
that
had
joined
in
the
panic
circled
a
veritable
picket
line
without
the
password
there
would
be
no
relief
ride
out
to
them
that
night
and
they
knew
it
and
settled
to
the
long
wait
for
morning
thurston
took
up
his
station
next
to
bob
rode
until
he
met
the
next
man
and
then
retraced
his
steps
till
he
faced
bob
again
rode
until
the
world
seemed
unreal
and
far
away
with
nothing
left
but
the
night
and
the
riding
back
and
forth
on
his
beat
and
the
rain
that
oozed
through
his
clothes
and
trickled
uncomfortably
down
inside
his
collar
he
lost
all
count
of
time
and
was
startled
when
at
last
came
gray
dawn
as
the
light
grew
brighter
his
eyes
widened
and
forgot
their
he
had
not
thought
it
would
be
like
this
he
was
riding
part
way
across
one
end
of
a
herd
larger
than
his
imagination
had
ever
pictured
three
thousand
cattle
had
seemed
to
him
a
multitude
yet
here
were
more
than
twenty
thousand
wet
draggled
their
backs
humped
miserably
from
the
rain
which
but
a
half
hour
since
had
ceased
he
was
still
gazing
and
wondering
when
park
rode
up
to
him
bud
you
a
sight
did
the
bunch
walk
over
yuh
he
greeted
only
sunfish
snapped
thurston
crossly
time
was
when
philip
thurston
would
not
have
answered
any
man
abruptly
however
great
the
provocation
he
was
only
lately
getting
down
to
the
real
elemental
man
of
him
to
the
son
of
bill
thurston
prospector
follower
of
dim
trails
he
rode
silently
back
to
camp
with
bob
ate
his
breakfast
got
into
dry
clothes
and
went
out
and
tied
his
slicker
deliberately
and
securely
behind
the
cantle
of
his
saddle
though
the
sun
was
shining
straight
into
his
eyes
and
the
sky
fairly
twinkled
it
was
so
clean
of
clouds
bob
watched
him
with
eyes
that
laughed
you
an
ambitious
he
chuckled
you
got
the
slicker
question
settled
in
your
mind
i
see
yuh
learn
easy
it
takes
two
or
three
soakings
to
learn
some
got
to
go
back
and
help
with
the

have
we
thurston
asked
horses
are
all
they
stay
out
too
till
noon
we
hike
to
bed
if
anybody
should
ask
so
it
was
not
till
after
dinner
that
he
rode
back
to
the
great
herd
with
his
kodak
in
his
pocket
to
find
the
cattle
split
up
into
several
bunches
the
riders
at
once
went
to
work
separating
the
different
brands
he
was
too
green
a
hand
to
do
anything
but
help
hold
the
and
that
was
so
much
like
ordinary
that
his
interest
flagged
he
wanted
more
than
anything
to
ride
into
the
bunch
and
single
out
a
lazy
eight
steer
skillfully
hazing
him
down
the
slope
to
the
cut
as
he
saw
the
others
do
bob
told
him
it
was
the
biggest
he
had
ever
seen
and
bob
had
ridden
the
range
in
every
state
where
beef
grows
wild
he
was
in
the
thickest
of
the
huddle
was
bob
working
as
if
he
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
fatigue
thurston
watching
him
thread
his
way
in
and
out
of
the
restless
milling
herd
only
to
reappear
unexpectedly
at
the
edge
with
a
steer
just
before
the
nose
of
his
horse
rush
it
out
from
among
the
others
wheeling
darting
this
way
and
that
as
it
tried
to
dodge
back
and
always
coming
off
victor
wondered
if
he
could
ever
learn
to
do
it
being
in
pessimistic
mood
he
told
himself
that
he
would
probably
always
remain
a
greenhorn
to
be
borne
with
and
coached
and
given
boy
work
to
do
all
because
he
had
been
cheated
of
his
legacy
of
the
dim
trails
and
forced
to
grow
up
in
a
city
hedged
about
all
his
life
by
artificial
conditions
his
conscience
wedded
to
convention
chapter
vi
the
big
divide
the
long
drive
was
nearly
over
even
thurston
eyes
brightened
when
he
saw
away
upon
the
the
hills
that
squatted
behind
the
home
ranch
of
the
lazy
eight
the
past
month
had
been
one
of
rapid
living
under
new
conditions
and
at
sight
of
them
it
seemed
only
a
few
days
since
he
had
first
glimpsed
that
broken
line
of
hills
and
the
bachelor
household
in
the
coulee
below
as
the
herd
swung
down
the
long
hill
into
the
valley
of
the
milk
river
stepping
out
briskly
as
they
sighted
the
cool
water
in
the
near
distance
the
past
month
dropped
away
from
thurston
and
what
had
gone
just
before
came
back
fresh
as
the
happenings
of
the
morning
there
was
the
stevens
ranch
a
scant
half
mile
away
from
where
the
tents
already
gleamed
on
their
last
camp
of
the
long
trail
the
smoke
from
the
telling
of
savory
meats
and
puddings
the
bare
thought
of
which
made
one
hurry
his
horse
his
eyes
dwelt
longest
however
upon
the
stevens
house
half
hidden
among
the
giant
cottonwoods
and
he
wondered
if
mona
would
still
smile
at
him
with
that
unpleasant
uplift
at
the
corner
of
her
red
mouth
he
would
take
care
that
she
did
not
get
the
chance
to
smile
at
him
in
any
fashion
he
told
himself
with
decision
he
wondered
if
those
had
been
captured
and
if
the
one
park
wounded
was
still
alive
he
shivered
when
he
thought
of
the
dead
man
in
the
aisle
and
hoped
he
would
never
witness
another
death
involuntarily
he
glanced
down
at
his
right
stirrup
half
expecting
to
see
his
boot
red
with
human
blood
it
was
not
nice
to
remember
that
scene
and
he
gave
his
shoulders
an
impatient
hitch
and
tried
to
think
of
something
else
mindful
of
his
vow
he
had
bought
a
gun
in
billings
but
he
had
not
yet
learned
to
hit
anything
he
aimed
at
for
firearms
are
hushed
in
roundup
camps
except
when
dire
necessity
breeds
a
law
of
its
own
range
cattle
do
not
take
kindly
to
the
popping
of
pistols
so
thurston
revolver
was
yet
unstained
with
powder
grime
and
was
packed
away
inside
his
bed
he
was
promising
his
pride
that
he
would
go
up
on
the
hill
back
of
the
lazy
eight
corrals
and
shoot
until
even
mona
stevens
must
respect
his
marksmanship
when
park
galloped
back
to
him
world
has
moved
some
while
we
was
gone
he
announced
in
the
tone
of
one
who
has
news
to
tell
and
enjoys
thoroughly
the
telling
mind
the
fellow
i
laid
out
in
the
he
got
all
right
again
and
they
stuck
him
in
jail
along
with
another
one
old
lauman
the
sheriff
glommed
a
week
ago
well
they
did
do
a
thing
last
night
but
knock
a
deputy
in
the
head
annex
his
gun
swipe
a
winchester
and
a
box
uh
shells
out
uh
the
office
and
hit
the
high
places
old
lauman
is
hot
on
their
trail
but
he
ai
met
up
with
yet
that
anybody
heard
when
he
does
there
sure
be
something
doing
they
say
the
deputy
about
all
in
they
smashed
his
skull
with
a
big
iron
wish
i
could
handle
a
gun
thurston
said
between
his
teeth
go
after
them
myself
i
wish
i
been
left
to
grow
up
out
here
where
i
belong
i
all
west
but
the
training
and
i
never
knew
it
till
a
month
ago
i
ought
to
ride
and
rope
and
shoot
with
the
best
of
you
and
i
ca
do
a
thing
all
i
know
is
books
i
can
criticize
an
opera
and
a
new
play
and
i
considered
something
of
an
authority
on
clothes
but
i
ca
go
easy
park
laughed
at
him
if
yuh
ca
do
the
riding
and
shooting
and
roping
all
right
we
very
well
get
along
without
them
accomplishments
but
that
all
they
are
just
accomplishments
we
know
a
man
when
we
see
him
and
it
matter
whether
he
can
ride
a
bronk
straight
up
or
do
know
which
way
a
saddle
sets
on
a
horse
if
he
a
man
he
gets
as
square
a
deal
as
we
can
give
park
reached
for
his
cigarette
book
as
for
hunting
outlaws
he
finished
got
old
lauman
paid
to
do
that
and
dead
onto
his
job
you
bet
when
he
goes
out
after
a
man
he
comes
pretty
near
getting
him
but
i
sure
do
wish
i
killed
that
jasper
while
i
was
about
it
it
would
have
saved
lauman
a
lot
uh
hard
thurston
could
scarcely
explain
to
park
that
his
desire
to
hunt
was
born
of
a
wish
to
vindicate
to
mona
stevens
his
courage
and
so
he
said
nothing
at
all
he
wondered
if
park
had
heard
her
whisper
that
day
and
knew
how
he
had
failed
to
obey
her
commands
and
if
he
had
heard
her
call
him
a
coward
he
had
often
wondered
that
but
park
had
a
way
of
keeping
things
to
himself
and
thurston
could
never
quite
bring
himself
to
open
the
subject
boldly
at
any
rate
if
park
had
heard
he
hoped
that
he
understood
how
it
was
and
did
not
secretly
despise
him
for
it
women
he
told
himself
bitterly
are
never
quite
just
after
the
four
supper
he
and
bob
macgregor
went
up
the
valley
to
relieve
the
men
on
herd
there
was
one
nice
thing
about
park
as
a
foreman
he
tried
to
pair
off
his
crew
according
to
their
congeniality
that
was
why
thurston
usually
stood
guard
with
bob
whom
he
liked
better
than
any
of
the
excepting
park
himself
brought
my
gun
along
bob
told
him
apologetically
when
they
were
left
to
themselves
a
habit
i
got
when
i
know
there
bad
men
rampaging
around
the
country
the
boys
kinda
gave
me
the
laugh
when
they
seen
me
haul
it
out
uh
my
war
bag
but
i
just
told
to
go
to
you
think
those
uh
course
not
i
just
pack
it
on
general
principles
same
as
an
old
woman
packs
her
this
is
dead
easy
the
bunch
is
pretty
well
broke
ai
it
sure
glad
to
see
old
milk
river
again
this
here
trailing
cattle
gets
plumb
he
got
down
and
settled
his
back
comfortably
against
a
rock
below
them
spread
the
herd
feeding
quietly
sir
this
is
sure
a
snap
he
repeated
after
he
had
made
himself
a
smoke
only
two
ways
a
bunch
could
drift
if
they
wanted
to
which
they
the
river
or
down
this
hill
a
little
too
steep
for
to
tackle
unless
they
was
crowded
hard
good
feed
here
too
bad
yuh
do
smoke
bud
there
nothing
like
a
good
smooth
rock
to
your
back
and
a
cigarette
in
your
face
on
a
nice
lazy
day
like
this
it
the
only
kind
uh
i
got
any
use
take
the
rock
to
my
back
if
you
just
slide
along
and
make
room
thurston
laughed
do
hanker
for
a
cigarette
but
i
do
wish
i
had
my
with
your
kodak
bob
snorted
yuh
carry
this
layout
in
your
head
i
got
a
picture
gallery
in
mine
that
i
would
trade
for
a
farm
i
do
need
no
kodak
in
mine
thankye
you
just
let
this
here
view
soak
into
your
system
bud
where
yuh
ca
lose
thurston
did
long
after
he
could
close
his
eyes
and
see
it
in
every
detail
the
long
green
slope
with
hundreds
of
cattle
loitering
in
the
rank
the
winding
sweep
of
the
river
and
the
green
rolling
hills
beyond
and
bob
leaning
against
the
rock
beside
him
smoking
luxuriously
with
eyes
while
their
horses
dozed
with
drooping
heads
a
away
bud
bob
voice
drawled
sleepily
wisht
you
sing
that
jerusalem
song
i
want
to
learn
the
words
to
it
i
plumb
stuck
on
that
piece
it
different
from
the
general
run
uh
songs
do
yuh
think
most
of
about
your
old
home
that
yuh
left
in
boyhood
happy
days
and
go
back
to
find
your
girl
dead
and
sleeping
in
a
little
or
else
it
your
mother
or
your
girl
marries
the
other
man
and
you
get
it
handed
to
yuh
right
along
and
they
make
a
fellow
kinda
sick
to
his
stomach
when
he
got
to
sing
two
or
three
hours
at
a
stretch
on
just
because
he
plumb
ignorant
of
anything
better
this
here
jerusalem
one
sounds
kinda
grand
and
the
cattle
seems
to
like
it
too
for
a
composer
would
feel
flattered
if
he
heard
that
thurston
laughed
he
wanted
to
be
left
alone
to
and
watch
the
clouds
trail
lazily
across
to
meet
the
hills
and
there
was
an
embryonic
poem
forming
phrase
by
phrase
in
his
mind
but
he
could
refuse
bob
anything
so
he
sat
a
bit
straighter
and
cleared
his
throat
he
sang
well
well
enough
indeed
to
be
sought
after
at
informal
affairs
among
his
set
at
home
when
he
came
to
the
refrain
bob
took
his
cigarette
from
between
his
lips
and
held
it
in
his
fingers
while
he
joined
his
voice
lustily
to
thurston
jerusalem
lift
up
your
gates
and
sing
hosanna
in
the
hosanna
to
your
king
the
near
cattle
lifted
their
heads
to
stare
stupidly
a
moment
then
moved
a
few
steps
slowly
nosing
for
the
sweetest
the
horses
shifted
their
weight
resting
one
leg
with
the
hoof
barely
touching
the
earth
twitched
their
ears
at
the
flies
and
slept
again
then
me
thought
my
dream
was
changed
the
streets
no
longer
rang
hushed
were
the
glad
hosannas
the
little
children
sang
tamale
lifted
his
head
and
gazed
inquiringly
up
the
hill
but
bob
was
not
observant
of
signs
just
then
he
was
striving
with
his
recreant
memory
for
the
words
that
came
after
sun
grew
dark
with
mystery
the
morn
was
cold
and
still
as
the
shadow
of
a
cross
arose
upon
a
lonely
tamale
stirred
restlessly
with
head
uplifted
and
ears
pointed
straight
before
up
the
steep
bluff
old
ironsides
thurston
mount
was
not
the
sort
to
worry
about
anything
but
his
feed
and
paid
no
attention
bob
turned
and
glanced
the
way
tamale
was
looking
saw
nothing
and
settled
down
again
on
the
small
of
his
back
sees
a
badger
or
something
he
said
on
bud
with
the
jerusalem
lift
up
your
gates
and
up
your
hands
damn
quick
mimicked
a
voice
just
behind
yuh
ai
got
anything
to
do
but
lay
in
the
shade
of
a
rock
and
yawp
borrow
your
cayuses
you
ai
needin
by
the
looks
they
squirmed
around
until
they
could
stare
into
two
black
and
then
their
hands
went
up
their
faces
held
a
particularly
foolish
expression
that
must
have
been
amusing
to
the
men
behind
the
guns
one
of
the
lowered
and
a
hand
reached
out
and
quietly
took
possession
of
tamale
reins
the
owner
of
the
hand
got
calmly
into
bob
saddle
bob
gritted
his
teeth
it
was
evident
their
movements
had
been
planned
minutely
in
advance
for
once
settled
to
his
liking
the
fellow
tested
the
stirrups
to
make
sure
they
were
the
right
length
and
raising
his
gun
pointed
it
at
the
two
in
a
manner
that
left
no
doubt
of
his
meaning
whereupon
the
man
behind
them
came
forward
and
appropriated
old
ironsides
to
his
own
use
bad
we
had
to
interrupt
he
remarked
ironically
can
go
ahead
with
the
meetin
now
the
collection
has
been
took
he
laughed
without
any
real
mirth
in
his
voice
and
gathered
up
the
reins
yuh
want
our
horses
they
up
on
the
bench
i
reckon
they
ever
turn
another
cow
but
such
as
they
are
you
quite
welcome
better
set
still
boys
till
we
get
out
uh
sight
one
of
keep
an
eye
peeled
for
yuh
so
long
and
much
they
turned
and
rode
warily
down
the
slope
would
that
jar
yuh
asked
bob
in
deep
disgust
his
hands
dropped
to
his
sides
in
another
second
he
was
up
and
shooting
savagely
behind
the
rock
bud
he
commanded
just
then
a
rifle
cracked
and
bob
toppled
drunkenly
and
went
limply
to
the
grass
god
cried
thurston
and
did
know
that
he
spoke
he
snatched
up
bob
revolver
and
fired
shot
after
shot
at
the
galloping
figures
not
one
seemed
to
do
any
good
the
first
shot
hit
a
square
in
the
ribs
after
that
there
were
no
cattle
within
rifle
range
one
of
the
outlaws
stopped
took
deliberate
aim
with
the
stolen
winchester
and
fired
meaning
to
kill
but
he
miscalculated
the
range
a
bit
and
thurston
crumpled
down
with
a
bullet
in
his
thigh
the
revolver
was
empty
now
and
fell
smoking
at
his
feet
so
he
lay
and
cursed
impotently
while
he
watched
the
marauders
ride
out
of
sight
up
the
valley
when
the
rank
hid
their
flying
figures
he
crawled
over
to
where
bob
lay
and
tried
to
lift
him
you
hurt
was
the
idiotic
question
he
asked
bob
opened
his
eyes
and
waited
a
breath
as
if
to
steady
his
thought
i
get
one
bud
afraid
not
thurston
confessed
and
immediately
after
wished
that
he
had
lied
and
said
yes
you
hurt
he
repeated
senselessly
me
bob
eyes
wavered
in
their
directness
yuh
bother
none
about
me
evasively
you
got
to
tell
me
you
they
he
choked
over
the
words
i
guess
they
got
me
all
right
but
do
let
that
worry
yuh
it
do
he
tried
to
speak
carelessly
and
convincingly
but
it
was
a
miserable
failure
he
did
not
want
to
die
did
bob
however
much
he
might
try
to
hide
the
fact
thurston
was
not
in
the
least
imposed
upon
he
turned
away
his
head
pretending
to
look
after
the
outlaws
and
set
his
teeth
together
tight
he
did
not
want
to
act
a
fool
all
at
once
he
grew
dizzy
and
sick
and
lay
down
heavily
till
the
faintness
passed
bob
tried
to
lift
himself
to
his
elbow
failing
that
he
put
out
a
hand
and
laid
it
on
thurston
shoulder
they
get
you
too
he
queried
anxiously
damn
coyotes
nothing
just
a
leg
put
out
of
business
thurston
hurried
to
assure
him
are
you
hurt
bob
i
ai
any
bob
retorted
weakly
but
gamely
inside
uh
me
it
went
in
my
side
but
the
lord
knows
where
it
wound
up
it
hurts
like
the
he
lay
quiet
a
minute
wish
do
yuh
feel
like
finishing
that
song
bud
thurston
gulped
down
a
lump
that
was
making
his
throat
ache
when
he
answered
his
voice
was
very
gentle
try
a
verse
old
last
one
we
just
come
to
the
last
it
most
like
church
i
i
never
went
much
on
religion
bud
but
when
a
fellow
going
out
over
the
big
not
thurston
contradicted
fiercely
as
if
that
could
make
it
different
he
thought
he
could
not
bear
those
jerky
sentences
right
bud
we
wo
fight
over
it
go
ahead
the
last
thurston
eased
his
leg
to
a
better
position
drew
himself
up
till
his
shoulders
rested
against
the
rock
and
began
with
an
occasional
odd
break
in
his
voice
saw
the
holy
city
beside
the
tideless
sea
the
light
of
god
was
on
its
street
the
gates
were
open
wide
and
all
who
would
might
enter
and
no
one
was
if
that
there
applies
to
cowpunchers
bob
muttered
drowsily
all
who
would
thurston
glanced
quickly
at
his
face
caught
his
breath
sharply
at
what
he
saw
there
written
and
dropped
his
head
upon
his
arms
and
so
park
and
his
men
hurrying
to
the
sound
of
the
shooting
found
them
in
the
shadow
of
the
rock
chapter
vii
at
the
stevens
place
when
the
excitement
of
the
outrage
had
been
pushed
aside
by
the
insistent
routine
of
everyday
living
thurston
found
himself
thrust
from
the
fascination
of
range
life
and
into
the
monotony
of
invalidism
and
he
was
anything
but
resigned
to
be
sure
he
was
well
cared
for
at
the
stevens
ranch
where
park
and
the
boys
had
taken
him
that
day
and
stevens
mothered
him
as
he
could
not
remember
being
mothered
before
hank
graves
rode
over
nearly
every
day
to
sit
beside
the
bed
and
curse
the
wagner
gang
back
to
their
and
down
to
more
than
the
third
generation
yet
unborn
and
to
tell
him
the
news
on
the
second
visit
he
started
to
give
him
the
details
of
bob
funeral
but
thurston
would
not
listen
and
told
him
so
plainly
right
then
bud
i
wo
talk
about
it
but
we
sure
done
the
right
thing
by
the
boy

the
best
preacher

shellanne

and
flowers
till
further
notice

cross

the
boys

i
shut
up
about
it
i
know
how
yuh
feel
bud
it
broke
us
all
up
to
have
him
go
that
way
he
sure
was
a
white
boy
if
ever
there
was
one
and
ahem
give
a
thousand
dollars
hard
coin
to
get
my
hands
on
them
wagners
it
would
uh
been
all
off
with
them
sure
if
the
boys
had
run
acrost
i
uh
let
stay
out
and
hunt
a
while
longer
only
old
lauman
get
all
right
and
we
late
as
it
is
with
the
calf
roundup
lauman
run
down
and
by
the
lord
i
hire
bowman
myself
and
ship
him
out
from
helena
to
help
prosecute
they
dead
men
if
he
takes
the
case
against
bud
and
i
get
him
sure
and
to
hell
with
the
cost
of
it
they
swing
for
what
they
done
to
you
and
bob
if
it
takes
every
hoof
i
thurston
told
him
he
hoped
they
would
be
caught
and
yes
hanged
though
he
had
never
before
advocated
capital
punishment
but
when
he
thought
of
bob
the
fellow
he
tried
not
to
think
of
him
for
thinking
unmanned
him
he
had
the
softest
of
hearts
where
his
friends
were
concerned
and
there
were
times
when
he
felt
that
he
could
with
relish
officiate
at
the
execution
he
fought
against
remembrance
of
that
day
and
for
sake
of
diversion
he
took
to
studying
a
large
pastel
portrait
of
mona
which
hung
against
the
wall
opposite
his
bed
it
was
rather
badly
done
and
at
first
when
he
saw
it
he
laughed
at
the
thought
that
even
the
great
still
plains
of
the
range
land
can
not
protect
one
against
the
ubiquitous
picture
agent
in
the
parlor
he
supposed
there
would
be
crayon
pictures
of
grandmothers
and
evidence
of
the
agent
glibness
he
was
glad
that
it
was
mona
who
smiled
down
at
him
instead
of
a
or
an
aunt
for
mona
did
smile
and
in
spite
of
the
cheap
crudity
the
smile
was
roguish
with
little
dimply
creases
at
the
corners
of
the
mouth
and
not
at
all
unpleasant
if
the
girl
would
only
look
like
that
in
real
life
he
told
himself
a
fellow
would
probably
get
to
liking
her
he
supposed
she
thought
him
a
greater
coward
than
ever
now
just
because
he
had
got
killed
if
he
had
he
would
be
a
hero
now
like
bob
well
bob
was
a
hero
the
way
he
had
jumped
up
and
begun
shooting
required
courage
of
the
suicidal
sort
he
had
stood
up
and
shot
also
and
had
succeeded
only
in
being
ridiculous
he
hoped
nobody
had
told
mona
about
his
hitting
that
steer
when
he
could
walk
again
he
would
learn
to
shoot
so
that
the
range
stock
would
suffer
from
his
marksmanship
after
a
week
of
seeing
only
stevens
or
sympathetic
men
acquaintances
he
began
to
wonder
why
mona
stayed
so
persistently
away
then
one
morning
she
came
in
to
take
his
breakfast
things
out
she
did
not
however
stay
a
second
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
and
she
was
perfectly
composed
and
said
good
morning
in
her
most
impersonal
tone
at
least
thurston
hoped
she
had
no
tone
more
impersonal
than
that
he
decided
that
she
had
really
beautiful
eyes
and
hair
after
she
had
gone
he
looked
up
at
the
picture
told
himself
that
it
did
not
begin
to
do
her
justice
and
sighed
a
bit
he
was
very
dull
and
even
her
companionship
he
thought
would
be
pleasant
if
only
she
would
come
down
off
her
pedestal
and
be
humanly
sociable
when
he
wrote
a
story
about
a
fellow
being
laid
up
in
the
same
house
with
a
girl
a
girl
with
big
eyes
and
ripply
brown
hair
he
would
have
the
girl
treat
the
fellow
at
least
decently
she
would
read
poetry
to
him
and
bring
him
flowers
and
do
ever
so
many
nice
things
that
would
make
him
hate
to
get
well
he
decided
that
he
would
write
just
that
kind
of
story
he
would
idealize
it
of
course
and
have
the
fellow
in
love
with
the
girl
you
have
to
in
stories
in
real
life
it
does
necessarily
follow
that
because
a
fellow
admires
a
girl
hair
and
eyes
and
wants
to
be
on
friendly
terms
he
is
in
love
with
her
for
example
he
emphatically
was
not
in
love
with
mona
stevens
he
only
wanted
her
to
be
decently
civil
and
to
stop
holding
a
foolish
grudge
against
him
for
not
standing
up
and
letting
himself
be
shot
full
of
holes
because
she
commanded
it
in
the
afternoons
stevens
would
sit
beside
him
and
knit
things
and
talk
to
him
in
a
pleasantly
garrulous
fashion
and
he
would
lie
and
listen
to
her
and
to
mona
singing
somewhere
mona
sang
very
well
he
thought
he
wondered
if
she
had
ever
had
any
training
also
he
wished
he
dared
ask
her
not
to
sing
that
song
about
only
a
bird
in
a
gilded
it
brought
back
too
vividly
the
nights
when
he
and
bob
stood
guard
under
the
quiet
stars
and
then
one
day
he
hobbled
out
into
the
and
ate
dinner
with
the
family
since
he
sat
opposite
mona
she
was
obliged
to
look
at
him
occasionally
whether
she
would
or
no
thurston
had
a
strain
of
obstinacy
in
his
nature
and
when
he
decided
that
mona
should
not
only
look
at
him
but
should
talk
to
him
as
well
he
set
himself
diligently
to
attain
that
end
he
was
not
the
man
to
sit
down
supinely
and
let
a
girl
calmly
ignore
him
so
mona
presently
found
herself
talking
to
him
with
some
degree
of
cordiality
and
what
is
more
to
the
point
listening
to
him
when
he
talked
it
is
probable
that
thurston
never
had
tried
so
hard
in
his
life
to
win
a
girl
attention
it
was
while
he
was
still
hobbling
with
a
cane
and
taxing
his
imagination
daily
to
invent
excuses
for
remaining
that
lauman
the
sheriff
rode
up
to
the
door
with
a
deputy
and
asked
shelter
for
themselves
and
the
two
wagners
who
glowered
sullenly
down
from
their
weary
horses
when
they
had
been
safely
disposed
in
thurston
bedroom
with
one
of
the
ranch
hands
detailed
to
guard
them
lauman
and
his
man
gave
themselves
up
to
the
joy
of
a
good
meal
their
own
cooking
they
said
got
mighty
tame
especially
when
they
had
much
to
cook
and
dared
not
have
a
fire
they
had
come
upon
the
outlaws
by
mere
accident
and
it
is
hard
telling
which
was
the
most
surprised
but
lauman
was
perhaps
the
quickest
man
with
a
gun
in
valley
county
else
he
would
not
have
been
serving
his
fourth
term
as
sheriff
he
got
the
drop
and
kept
it
while
his
deputy
did
the
rest
it
had
been
a
hard
chase
he
said
and
a
long
one
if
you
counted
time
instead
of
miles
but
he
had
them
now
harmless
as
rattlers
with
their
fangs
fresh
drawn
he
wanted
to
get
them
to
glasgow
before
people
got
to
hear
of
their
capture
he
thought
they
would
be
any
too
safe
if
the
boys
knew
he
had
them
if
he
had
known
that
the
lazy
eight
roundup
had
just
pulled
in
to
the
home
ranch
that
afternoon
and
that
dick
farney
one
of
the
stevens
men
had
slipped
out
to
the
corral
and
saddled
his
swiftest
horse
it
is
quite
possible
that
lauman
would
not
have
lingered
so
long
over
his
supper
or
drank
his
third
cup
of
coffee
with
real
cream
in
it
with
so
great
a
relish
and
if
he
had
known
that
the
circle
bar
boys
were
camped
just
three
miles
away
within
hailing
distance
of
the
lazy
eight
trail
he
would
doubtless
have
postponed
his
smoke
he
was
sitting
revolver
in
hand
watching
the
wagners
give
a
practical
demonstration
of
the
extent
of
their
appetites
when
thurston
limped
in
from
the
porch
his
eyes
darker
than
usual
are
a
lot
of
riders
coming
lauman
he
announced
quietly
sounds
like
a
whole
roundup
i
thought
you
ought
to
the
prisoners
went
white
and
put
down
knife
and
fork
if
they
had
never
feared
before
plainly
they
were
afraid
then
lauman
face
did
not
in
the
least
change
the
on
waller
he
said
you
got
a
room
that
ai
easy
to
get
at
from
the
outside
stevens
i
guess
i
have
to
ask
yuh
for
the
use
of
stevens
had
lived
long
in
valley
county
and
had
learned
how
to
meet
emergencies
right
down
cellar
she
invited
briskly
just
the
into
it
and
the
windows
ai
big
enough
for
a
cat
to
go
through
mona
get
a
candle
for
she
turned
to
hurry
the
girl
and
found
mona
at
her
elbow
with
a
light
the
kind
uh
woman
i
like
to
have
around
lauman
chuckled
on
boys
hustle
down
there
if
yuh
want
to
see
glasgow
trembling
all
their
courage
sapped
from
them
by
the
menace
of
thurston
words
they
stumbled
down
the
steep
stairs
and
the
darkness
swallowed
them
lauman
beckoned
to
his
deputy
go
with
waller
he
ordered
anybody
but
me
offers
to
lift
this
trap
shoot
do
yuh
take
any
chances
blow
out
that
candle
soon
as
you
it
was
then
that
fifty
riders
clattered
into
the
yard
and
up
to
the
front
door
grouping
in
a
way
that
left
no
exit
unseen
thurston
standing
in
the
doorway
knew
them
almost
to
a
man
lazy
eight
boys
they
were
men
who
night
after
night
had
spread
their
blankets
under
the
with
him
and
with
bob
macgregor
bob
who
lay
silently
out
on
the
hill
back
of
the
home
waiting
for
the
last
great
they
glanced
at
him
in
mute
greeting
and
dismounted
without
a
word
with
them
mingled
the
circle
bar
boys
as
silent
and
grim
as
their
fellows
lauman
came
up
and
peered
into
the
dusk
thurston
observed
that
he
carried
his
winchester
unobtrusively
in
one
hand
hello
boys
he
greeted
cheerfully
but
for
the
rifle
you
never
would
have
guessed
he
knew
their
errand
lauman
answered
park
matching
him
for
cheerfulness
then
rode
over
to
hang
them
lauman
grinned
hate
to
disappoint
yuh
park
but
i
kinda
set
my
heart
on
doing
that
little
job
myself
i
the
one
that
caught
and
if
you
followed
my
trail
the
last
month
you
say
i
earned
the
so
park
admitted
pleasantly
we
got
a
little
personal
matter
to
settle
up
with
those
jaspers
bob
macgregor
was
one
of
us
yuh
hang
just
as
dead
as
you
can
lauman
argued
yuh
wo
do
it
so
quick
park
lashed
back
spoiling
the
air
every
breath
they
draw
we
want
and
i
guess
that
pretty
near
settles
by
a
damn
sight
it
do
i
never
had
a
man
took
away
from
me
yet
boys
and
i
been
your
sheriff
a
good
many
years
you
hike
right
back
to
camp
yuh
ca
have
thurston
could
scarcely
realize
the
deadliness
of
their
purpose
he
knew
them
for
young
fellows
who
would
give
their
last
dollar
to
a
friend
he
could
not
believe
that
they
would
resort
to
violence
now
besides
this
was
not
his
idea
of
a
mob
he
had
fancied
they
would
howl
threats
and
wave
bludgeons
as
they
did
in
stories
mobs
always
and
seethed
with
at
one
doors
they
did
not
stand
about
and
talk
quietly
as
though
the
subject
was
trivial
and
did
not
greatly
concern
them
but
the
men
were
pressing
closer
and
their
very
calmness
had
he
known
it
was
ominous
lauman
shifted
his
rifle
ready
for
instant
aim
look
here
he
began
more
gravely
ca
say
i
blame
yuh
looking
at
it
from
your
if
you
caught
these
men
when
yuh
was
out
hunting
you
could
uh
strung
up
and
i
likely
uh
had
business
somewhere
else
about
that
time
but
yuh
did
catch
yuh
give
up
the
chase
and
left
to
me
and
yuh
got
to
remember
that
the
one
that
brought
in
they
in
my
care
i
sworn
to
protect
and
turn
over
to
the
law
and
it
ai
a
question
uh
whether
they
deserve
it
or
not
that
what
i
paid
for
and
i
expect
to
go
right
ahead
according
to
orders
and
hang
by
law
you
ca
have
unless
yuh
lay
me
out
first
and
i
do
reckon
any
of
yuh
would
go
that
never
been
a
man
hung
by
law
in
this
county
yet
a
voice
cried
angrily
and
impatiently
ai
saying
there
never
will
be
lauman
flung
back
yuh
worry
they
get
all
that
coming
to
them
all
about
the
time
yuh
had
in
your
rotten
old
jail
and
let
get
out
and
run
loose
around
the
country
killing
off
white
men
drawled
man
a
hand
the
hand
of
him
who
had
stood
guard
over
the
wagners
in
the
bedroom
during
supper
reached
out
through
the
doorway
and
caught
his
rifle
arm
taken
unawares
from
behind
he
whirled
and
then
went
down
under
the
weight
of
men
used
to
calves
even
old
lauman
was
no
match
for
them
and
presently
he
found
himself
stretched
upon
the
porch
with
three
lazy
eight
boys
sitting
on
his
person
which
being
inclined
to
portliness
he
found
very
uncomfortable
moved
by
an
impulse
he
had
no
name
for
thurston
snatched
the
revolver
from
its
scabbard
as
the
heap
squirmed
pantingly
upon
the
porch
he
stepped
into
the
doorway
to
avoid
being
tripped
which
was
the
wisest
move
he
could
have
made
for
it
put
him
in
the
shadow
and
there
were
men
of
the
circle
bar
whose
would
not
have
hesitated
just
then
had
he
been
in
plain
sight
and
had
they
known
his
purpose
hold
on
there
boys
he
called
and
they
could
see
the
glimmer
of
the
those
of
the
lazy
eight
laughed
at
him
put
it
down
bud
park
admonished
too
dangerous
a
toy
for
you
to
be
playing
with
and
yuh
know
damn
well
yuh
ca
hit
killed
a
steer
once
thurston
reminded
him
meekly
whereat
the
laugh
hushed
for
they
remembered
know
i
ca
shoot
straight
he
went
on
frankly
you
taking
that
much
the
greater
chance
if
i
have
to
i
cut
loose
and
no
telling
where
the
bullets
may
right
park
admitted
still
boys
he
more
dangerous
than
a
gun
that
is
loaded
what
want
want
to
talk
to
you
for
about
five
minutes
i
got
a
game
leg
so
that
i
can
neither
run
nor
fight
but
i
hope
you
listen
to
me
the
wagners
ca
get
away
they
locked
up
with
a
deputy
standing
over
them
with
a
gun
and
on
top
of
that
they
handcuffed
they
as
helpless
boys
as
two
trapped
he
looked
down
over
the
crowd
which
shifted
uneasily
no
one
spoke
what
struck
me
most
he
continued
know
what
i
thought
of
bob
do
you
and
i
did
thank
them
for
boring
a
hole
in
my
leg
it
was
any
kindness
of
theirs
that
it
did
land
higher
they
shooting
at
me
for
fun
and
i
have
killed
them
both
with
a
clear
conscience
if
i
could
i
tried
hard
enough
but
it
was
different
then
out
in
the
open
where
a
man
had
an
even
break
i
do
believe
if
i
had
shot
as
straight
as
i
wanted
to
that
i
ever
have
felt
a
compunction
but
now
when
they
disarmed
and
shackled
and
altogether
helpless
i
could
walk
up
to
them
deliberately
and
kill
them
could
you
could
be
done
and
done
easily
you
have
lauman
where
he
ca
do
anything
and
i
not
of
much
account
in
a
fight
so
you
really
only
one
deputy
sheriff
and
two
women
to
get
the
best
of
you
could
drag
these
men
out
and
hang
them
in
the
cottonwoods
and
they
could
raise
a
hand
to
defend
themselves
we
could
do
it
easily
but
when
it
was
done
and
the
excitement
had
passed
i
have
a
picture
in
my
memory
that
hate
to
look
at
i
have
an
hour
in
my
life
that
would
haunt
me
and
so
would
you
you
hate
to
look
back
and
think
that
one
time
you
helped
kill
a
couple
of
men
who
could
fight
back
the
law
do
it
boys
you
do
want
them
to
live
and
i
do
nobody
does
for
they
deserve
to
die
but
it
is
for
us
to
play
judge
and
jury
and
hangman
here
let
them
get
what
coming
to
them
at
the
hands
of
the
officers
you
elected
for
that
purpose
they
get
off
hank
graves
says
they
will
hang
if
it
takes
every
hoof
he
owns
he
said
he
would
bring
bowman
down
here
to
help
prosecute
them
i
know
bowman
do
a
voice
spoke
somewhere
in
the
darkness
from
helena
never
lost
a
glad
to
hear
it
for
he
the
man
that
will
prosecute
they
a
ghost
of
a
show
to
get
out
of
it
lauman
here
is
responsible
for
their
safe
keeping
and
i
guess
now
that
he
knows
them
better
we
need
be
afraid
they
escape
again
and
it
as
lauman
said
he
hang
them
quite
as
dead
as

he
drawing

salary
to
do
these
things
make
him
earn
it
it
a
nasty
job
boys
and
you
would
get
anything
out
of
it
but
a
nasty
a
hand
that
did
not
feel
like
the
hand
of
a
man
rested
for
an
instant
on
his
arm
mona
brushed
by
him
and
stepped
out
where
the
rising
moon
shone
on
her
hair
and
into
her
big
eyes
wish
you
all
would
please
go
away
she
said
are
making
mamma
sick
she
got
it
in
her
head
that
you
are
going
to
do
something
awful
and
i
ca
convince
her
you
not
i
told
her
you
would
do
anything
so
sneaking
but
she
awfully
nervous
about
it
wo
you
please
go
right
now
they
looked
sheepishly
at
one
another
every
man
of
them
feared
the
ridicule
of
his
neighbor
sure
we
go
cried
park
rallying
were
going
anyway
in
a
minute
tell
your
mother
we
were
just
congratulating
lauman
on
rounding
up
these
wagners
come
on
boys
and
you
bud
hurry
up
and
get
well
again
we
miss
yuh
round
the
lazy
the
three
who
were
sitting
on
lauman
got
up
and
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
yuh
darned
cowpunchers
do
have
no
mercy
on
an
old
carcass
at
all
he
groaned
in
exaggerated
time
yuh
want
to
congratulate
me
i
wish
you
put
it
in
writing
and
send
it
by
a
little
ripple
of
laughter
went
through
the
crowd
then
they
swung
up
on
their
horses
and
galloped
away
in
the
moonlight
chapter
viii
a
question
of
nerve
was
your
victory
miss
stevens
allow
me
to
congratulate
if
thurston
showed
any
ill
grace
in
his
tone
it
was
without
intent
but
it
did
seem
unfortunate
that
just
as
he
was
waxing
eloquent
and
felt
sure
of
himself
and
something
of
a
hero
mona
should
push
him
aside
as
though
he
were
of
no
account
and
disperse
a
bunch
of
angry
cowboys
with
half
a
dozen
words
she
looked
at
him
with
her
direct
eyes
and
smiled
and
her
smile
had
no
unpleasant
uplift
at
the
corners
it
was
the
dimply
roguish
smile
of
the
pastel
portrait
only
several
times
nicer
re
could
hardly
believe
it
he
just
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
stared
when
he
came
to
a
sense
of
his
rudeness
mona
was
back
in
the
kitchen
helping
with
the
supper
dishes
just
as
though
nothing
had
happened
unless
one
observed
the
deep
of
her
cheeks
while
her
mother
who
showed
not
the
faintest
symptoms
of
collapse
flourished
a
dish
towel
made
of
a
bleached
flour
sack
with
the
stamp
showing
a
faint
pink
and
blue
xxxx
across
the
center
knew
all
the
time
they
would
do
anything
when
it
came
right
to
the
point
she
declared
their
hearts
they
thought
they
would
but
they
too
even
when
they
are
mad
if
yuh
go
at
right
yuh
can
talk
over
easy
it
done
me
good
to
hear
yuh
talk
right
up
to
stevens
had
called
hi
bud
from
the
first
time
she
laid
eyes
on
him
all
under
the
sun
they
needed
just
somebody
to
set
thinking
about
the
other
side
you
a
real
good
speaker
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
study
to
be
a
thurston
face
turned
red
but
presently
he
forgot
everything
in
his
amazement
for
mona
the
dignified
mona
of
the
scornful
eyes
and
the
chilly
smile
actually
giggled
giggled
like
any
ordinary
girl
and
shot
him
a
glance
that
had
in
it
pure
mirth
and
roguish
teasing
and
a
dash
of
coquetry
he
sat
down
and
giggled
with
her
feeling
idiotically
happy
and
for
no
reason
under
the
sun
that
he
could
name
he
had
promised
his
conscience
that
he
would
go
home
to
the
lazy
eight
in
the
morning
but
he
did
he
somehow
contrived
overnight
to
invent
a
brand
new
excuse
for
his
conscience
to
swallow
or
not
as
it
liked
hank
graves
had
the
same
privilege
as
for
the
stevens
trio
he
blessed
their
hospitable
souls
for
not
wanting
any
excuse
whatever
for
his
staying
they
were
frankly
glad
to
have
him
there
at
least
stevens
and
jack
were
as
for
mona
he
was
not
so
sure
but
he
hoped
she
did
mind
this
was
the
reason
inspired
by
his
great
desire
he
was
going
to
write
a
story
and
mona
was
unconsciously
to
furnish
the
material
for
his
heroine
and
so
of
course
he
needed
to
be
there
so
that
he
might
study
his
subject
that
sounded
very
well
to
himself
but
to
hank
graves
for
some
reason
it
seemed
very
funny
when
thurston
told
him
hank
was
taken
with
a
fit
of
strangling
that
turned
his
face
a
dark
purple
afterward
he
explained
brokenly
that
something
had
got
down
his
sunday
throat
and
thurston
who
had
never
heard
of
a
man
sunday
throat
eyed
him
with
suspicion
hank
blinked
at
him
with
tears
still
in
his
quizzical
eyes
and
slapped
him
on
the
back
after
the
way
of
the
west
and
any
other
enlightened
country
where
men
are
not
too
dignified
to
be
their
real
selves
and
drawled
in
a
way
peculiar
to
himself
all
right
bud
you
stay
right
here
as
long
as
yuh
want
to
i
do
blame
yuh
if
i
was
you
i
want
to
spend
a
lot
uh
time
studying
this
particular
brand
uh
female
girl
myself
she
out
uh
sight
bud
and
i
do
believe
any
uh
the
boys
has
got
his
loop
on
her
so
far
though
i
could
name
a
dozen
or
so
that
would
be
tickled
to
death
if
they
had
you
just
go
right
ahead
and
file
your
little
old
claim
getting
things
mixed
thurston
interrupted
rather
testily
not
in
love
with
her
i
well
it
like
this
if
you
were
going
to
paint
a
picture
of
those
mountains
off
there
you
want
to
be
where
you
could
look
at
them
would
you
you
would
necessarily
want
to
to
own
them
just
because
you
felt
they
make
a
fine
picture
your
interest
would
be
er
entirely
hank
agreed
his
keen
eyes
searching
phil
face
amusedly
it
does
follow
that
i
getting
foolish
about
a
girl
just
because
i
hang
it
what
the
dickens
makes
you
look
at
a
fellow
that
way
you
make
me
said
hank
again
smoothing
the
lower
half
of
his
face
with
one
hand
a
mighty
nice
little
boy
bud
i
bet
mona
thinks
so
too
and
when
yuh
get
growed
up
you
know
a
whole
lot
more
than
yuh
do
right
now
well
i
guess
i
be
moving
when
yuh
get
that
er
story
done
you
come
back
to
the
ranch
i
reckon
be
thurston
watched
him
ride
away
and
then
flounced
oh
men
do
flounce
at
times
in
spirit
if
not
in
deed
and
there
would
be
no
lack
of
the
deed
if
only
they
wore
skirts
that
could
rustle
indignantly
in
sympathy
with
the
wearer
to
his
room
plainly
hank
did
not
swallow
the
excuse
any
more
readily
than
did
his
conscience
to
prove
the
sincerity
of
his
assertion
to
himself
his
conscience
and
to
hank
graves
he
straightway
got
out
a
thick
pad
of
paper
and
sharpened
three
lead
pencils
to
an
exceeding
fine
point
then
he
sat
him
down
by
the
window
where
he
could
see
the
kitchen
door
which
was
the
one
most
used
by
the
family
and
nibbled
the
tip
off
one
of
the
pencils
like
any
for
ten
minutes
he
bluffed
himself
into
believing
that
he
was
trying
to
think
of
a
title
the
plain
truth
is
he
was
wondering
if
mona
would
go
for
a
ride
that
afternoon
and
if
so
might
he
venture
to
suggest
going
with
her
he
thought
of
the
crimply
waves
in
mona
hair
and
pondered
what
adjectives
would
best
describe
it
without
seeming
commonplace
was
too
old
though
it
did
seem
to
hit
the
case
all
right
he
laid
down
the
pad
and
nearly
stood
on
his
head
trying
to
reach
his
dictionary
of
synonyms
and
antonyms
without
getting
out
of
his
chair
while
he
was
clawing
after
it
it
lay
on
the
floor
where
he
had
thrown
it
that
morning
because
it
refused
to
divulge
some
information
he
wanted
he
heard
some
one
open
and
close
the
kitchen
door
and
came
near
kinking
his
neck
trying
to
get
up
in
time
to
see
who
it
was
he
failed
to
see
anyone
and
returned
to
the
dictionary
to
have
waves
like
running
water
that
was
just
the
way
her
hair
looked
especially
over
the
temples
and
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
jove
what
a
tempting
white
neck
it
was
wave
undulate
uneven
irregular
lord
what
fools
are
the
men
who
write
dictionaries
hang
the
antonyms
the
kitchen
door
slammed
he
craned
again
it
was
jack
going
to
town
most
likely
thurston
shrewdly
guessed
that
stevens
leaned
far
more
upon
mona
than
she
did
upon
jack
although
he
could
hardly
accuse
her
of
leaning
on
anyone
but
he
observed
that
the
men
looked
to
her
for
orders
he
perceived
that
the
point
was
gone
from
his
pencil
and
proceeded
to
sharpen
it
then
he
heard
mona
singing
in
the
kitchen
and
recollected
that
stevens
had
promised
him
warm
doughnuts
for
supper
perhaps
mona
was
frying
them
at
that
identical
moment
and
he
had
never
seen
anyone
frying
doughnuts
he
caught
up
his
cane
and
limped
out
to
investigate
that
is
how
much
his
heart
just
then
was
set
upon
writing
a
story
that
would
breathe
of
the
plains
one
great
hindrance
to
the
progress
of
his
story
was
the
difficulty
he
had
in
selecting
a
hero
for
his
heroine
hank
graves
suggested
that
he
use
park
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
supply
thurston
with
considerable
data
which
went
to
prove
that
park
would
not
be
averse
to
figuring
in
a
love
story
with
mona
but
thurston
was
not
what
one
might
call
enthusiastic
and
hank
laughed
his
deep
inner
laugh
when
he
was
well
away
from
the
house
thurston
on
the
contrary
glowered
at
the
world
for
two
hours
after
park
was
a
fine
fellow
and
thurston
liked
him
about
as
well
as
any
man
he
knew
in
the
west
but
and
thus
it
went
on
each
and
every
visit
to
the
stevens
ranch
and
they
were
many
hank
learning
by
direct
inquiry
that
the
story
still
suffered
for
lack
of
a
hero
suggested
some
fellow
whom
he
had
at
one
time
and
another
caught
around
mona
and
with
each
suggestion
thurston
would
draw
down
his
eyebrows
till
he
came
near
getting
a
permanent
frown
a
love
story
without
a
hero
while
it
would
no
doubt
be
original
and
all
that
would
hardly
appeal
to
an
editor
phil
tried
heroes
wholly
imaginary
but
he
had
a
trick
of
making
his
characters
seem
very
real
to
himself
and
sometimes
to
other
people
as
well
so
that
after
a
few
passages
of
more
or
less
ardent
he
would
in
a
sense
grow
jealous
and
spoil
the
story
by
annihilating
the
hero
thereof
heaven
only
knows
how
long
the
thing
would
have
gone
on
if
he
had
one
temptingly
beautiful
evening
reverted
to
the
day
of
the
and
apologized
for
not
obeying
her
command
he
explained
as
well
as
he
could
just
why
he
sat
petrified
with
his
hands
in
the
air
and
then
having
brought
the
thing
freshly
to
her
mind
he
somehow
lost
control
of
his
wits
and
told
her
he
loved
her
he
told
her
a
good
deal
in
the
next
two
minutes
that
he
might
better
have
kept
to
himself
just
then
but
a
man
generally
makes
a
glorious
fool
of
himself
once
or
twice
in
his
life
and
it
seems
the
more
sensible
the
man
the
more
thorough
a
job
he
makes
of
it
mona
moved
a
little
farther
away
from
him
and
when
she
answered
she
did
not
choose
her
words
all
things
she
said
evenly
admire
a
brave
man
and
despise
a
coward
you
were
that
day
and
you
know
it
you
just
admitted
it
why
in
another
minute
i
have
had
that
gun
myself
and
i
have
shown
you
but
park
got
it
before
i
really
had
a
chance
i
hated
to
seem
spectacular
but
it
served
you
right
if
you
had
any
nerve
i
would
have
had
to
sit
there
and
tell
you
what
to
do
if
ever
i
marry
anybody
thurston
it
will
be
a
means
i
suppose
that
i
not
one
he
asked
angrily
do
know
mona
smiled
her
unpleasant
smile
the
one
that
did
not
belong
in
the
story
he
was
going
to
write
new
to
the
country
you
see
maybe
you
got
nerve
you
have
shown
much
so
far
as
i
know
except
when
you
talked
to
the
boys
that
night
but
you
must
have
known
that
they
would
hurt
you
anyway
a
man
must
have
a
little
courage
as
much
as
i
have
which
is
asking
much
or
i
never
marry
him
in
the
even
if
you
liked
him
his
smile
was
wistful
even
if
i
loved
him
mona
declared
and
fled
into
the
house
thurston
gathered
himself
together
and
went
down
to
the
stable
and
borrowed
a
horse
of
jack
who
had
just
got
back
from
town
and
rode
home
to
the
lazy
eight
when
hank
heard
that
he
was
home
to
stay
at
least
until
he
could
join
the
roundup
again
he
did
say
a
word
for
full
five
minutes
then
your
story
done
he
drawled
and
his
eyes
twinkled
thurston
was
going
up
the
stairs
to
his
old
room
and
hank
could
not
swear
positively
to
the
reply
he
got
but
he
thought
it
sounded
like
damn
the
story
chapter
ix
the
drift
of
the
herds
weeks
slipped
by
and
to
thurston
they
seemed
but
days
his
and
cynicism
disappeared
the
first
time
he
met
mona
after
he
had
left
there
so
unceremoniously
for
mona
not
being
aware
of
his
cynicism
received
him
on
the
old
friendly
footing
and
seemed
to
have
quite
forgotten
that
she
had
ever
called
him
a
coward
or
refused
to
marry
him
so
thurston
forgot
it
also
so
long
as
he
was
with
her
how
he
filled
in
the
hours
he
could
scarcely
have
told
certain
it
is
that
he
accomplished
nothing
at
all
so
far
as
western
stories
were
concerned
wrote
in
slightly
shocked
phrases
to
ask
what
was
keeping
him
so
long
and
assured
him
that
he
was
missing
much
by
staying
away
thurston
mentally
agreed
with
him
long
enough
to
begin
packing
his
trunk
it
was
idiotic
to
keep
staying
on
when
he
was
clearly
receiving
no
benefit
thereby
when
however
he
picked
up
a
book
which
he
had
told
mona
he
would
take
over
to
her
the
next
time
he
went
he
stopped
and
considered
there
was
the
wagner
trial
coming
off
in
a
month
or
so
he
could
get
out
of
attending
it
for
he
had
been
subpoenaed
as
a
witness
for
the
prosecution
and
there
was
the
beef
roundup
going
to
start
before
long
he
really
ought
to
stay
and
take
that
in
there
would
be
some
fine
chances
for
pictures
and
really
he
did
care
so
much
for
the
barry
wilson
bunch
and
the
long
list
of
festivities
which
trailed
ever
in
its
wake
at
any
rate
they
were
worth
rushing
across
the
continent
for
he
sat
down
and
wrote
at
length
to
explaining
very
carefully
and
not
altogether
convincingly
just
why
he
could
not
possibly
go
home
at
present
after
that
he
saddled
and
rode
over
to
the
stevens
place
with
the
book
leaving
his
trunk
yawning
emptily
in
the
middle
of
his
badly
jumbled
belongings
after
that
he
spent
three
weeks
on
the
beef
roundup
at
first
he
was
full
of
enthusiasm
and
worked
quite
as
if
he
had
need
of
the
wages
but
after
two
or
three
big
drives
the
novelty
wore
off
quite
suddenly
and
nothing
then
remained
but
a
lot
of
hard
work
for
instance
standing
guard
on
long
rainy
nights
when
the
cattle
walked
and
walked
might
at
first
seem
picturesque
and
all
that
but
must
at
length
cease
to
be
amusing
likewise
the
long
hours
which
he
spent
on
when
the
wind
was
raw
and
penetrating
and
like
to
blow
him
out
of
the
saddle
also
standing
at
the
stockyard
chutes
and
forcing
an
unwilling
stream
of
rollicky
steers
up
into
the
cars
that
would
carry
them
to
chicago
after
three
weeks
of
it
he
awoke
one
particularly
nasty
morning
and
thanked
the
lord
he
was
not
obliged
to
earn
his
bread
at
all
to
say
nothing
of
earning
it
in
so
distressful
a
fashion
there
was
a
lull
in
the
shipping
because
cars
were
not
then
available
he
promptly
took
advantage
of
it
and
rode
by
the
very
shortest
trail
to
the
ranch
and
mona
but
mona
was
visiting
friends
in
chinook
and
there
was
no
telling
when
she
would
return
thurston
in
the
next
few
days
owned
to
himself
that
there
was
no
good
reason
for
his
tarrying
longer
in
the
big
west
and
that
the
proper
thing
for
him
to
do
was
go
back
home
to
new
york
he
had
come
to
stay
a
month
and
he
had
stayed
five
he
could
ride
and
rope
like
an
and
he
was
well
qualified
to
put
up
a
stiff
had
the
necessity
ever
arisen
which
it
had
not
he
had
three
hundred
and
pictures
of
different
phases
of
range
life
not
counting
as
many
that
were
or
or
out
of
focus
he
had
six
unfinished
stories
in
each
of
which
the
heroine
had
big
eyes
and
crimply
hair
and
the
title
and
bare
skeleton
of
a
seventh
in
which
the
same
sort
of
eyes
and
hair
would
probably
develop
later
he
had
proposed
to
mona
three
times
and
had
been
three
times
rebuffed
though
not
it
must
be
owned
with
that
tone
of
finality
which
precludes
hope
he
was
tanned
a
fine
brown
which
became
him
well
his
eyes
had
lost
the
dreamy
introspective
look
of
the
student
and
author
and
had
grown
keen
with
the
habit
of
studying
objects
at
long
range
he
walked
with
that
peculiar
gait
which
betrays
long
hours
spent
in
the
saddle
and
he
wore
a
silk
handkerchief
around
his
neck
habitually
and
had
forgotten
the
feel
of
a
he
answered
to
the
name
more
readily
than
to
his
own
and
he
made
practical
use
of
the
slang
and
colloquialisms
of
the
plains
without
any
mental
quotation
marks
by
all
these
signs
and
tokens
he
had
learned
his
west
and
should
have
taken
himself
back
to
civilization
when
came
the
frost
he
had
come
to
get
into
touch
with
his
chosen
field
of
fiction
that
he
might
write
as
one
knowing
whereof
he
spoke
so
far
as
he
had
gone
he
was
in
touch
with
it
he
was
steeped
to
the
eyes
in
local
color
and
there
was
the
rub
the
lure
of
it
was
strong
upon
him
and
he
might
not
loosen
its
hold
he
was
the
son
of
his
father
he
had
found
himself
and
knew
that
like
him
he
loved
best
to
travel
the
dim
trails
gene
wasson
came
in
and
slammed
the
door
emphatically
shut
after
him
sure
coming
he
complained
while
he
pulled
the
icicles
from
his
mustache
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
going
to
be
a
real
old
howler
by
the
signs
what
yuh
doing
bud
writing
poetry
thurston
nodded
assent
with
certain
mental
reservations
so
far
the
editors
could
seem
to
make
up
their
minds
that
it
was
poetry
say
i
wish
you
slap
in
a
lot
uh
things
about
hazy
lazy
daisy
days
in
the
spring
that
jingles
fine
and
green
grass
and
the
sun
shining
and
making
the
hills
all
goldy
yellow
and
prairie
dogs
on
the
flats
prairie
dogs
would
go
all
right
in
poetry
would
they
they
sassy
little
cusses
and
i
do
know
of
anything
that
would
rhyme
with
but
maybe
you
do
and
read
it
all
out
to
me
after
supper
maybe
it
make
me
kinda
forget
there
a
blizzard
one
thurston
got
up
to
scratch
a
trench
in
the
layer
of
frost
on
the
cabin
window
it
only
cleared
up
this
morning
after
three
days
of
help
that
this
is
just
another
chapter
uh
that
same
story
when
these
here
klondike
chinooks
gets
to
lapping
over
each
other
they
never
know
when
to
quit
every
darn
one
has
got
to
be
continued
tacked
onto
the
tail
of
it
the
winter
all
the
difference
is
you
ca
read
the
writing
but
i
got
some
mail
for
yuh
bud
and
old
hank
wanted
me
to
ask
yuh
if
you
like
to
go
to
glasgow
next
thursday
and
watch
old
lauman
start
the
wagner
boys
for
wherever
hot
enough
he
can
get
yuh
in
you
being
in
the
writing
business
he
says
to
tell
yuh
it
a
good
chance
to
take
notes
so
yuh
can
write
a
real
stylish
story
with
lots
uh
murder
and
sudden
death
in
it
we
do
hang
folks
out
here
very
often
and
yuh
might
have
to
go
back
east
after
pointers
if
yuh
pass
this
go
easy
it
turns
me
sick
when
i
think
about
it
how
they
looked
when
they
got
their
sentence
and
all
that
i
certainly
do
care
to
see
them
hanged
though
they
do
deserve
it
where
are
the
letters
thurston
sprawled
across
the
table
for
them
one
was
from
he
put
it
by
another
had
a
printed
address
in
the
corner
an
address
that
started
his
pulse
a
beat
or
two
faster
for
he
had
not
yet
reached
that
blase
stage
where
he
could
receive
a
personal
letter
from
one
of
the
without
the
flicker
of
an
he
still
gloated
over
his
successes
and
was
cast
into
the
deeps
by
his
failures
he
held
the
envelope
to
the
light
shook
it
tentatively
like
any
woman
guessed
hastily
and
hopefully
at
the
contents
and
tore
off
an
end
impatiently
from
the
great
fireplace
gene
watched
him
curiously
and
half
enviously
he
wished
he
could
get
letters
from
new
york
every
few
days
it
must
make
a
fellow
feel
that
he
amounted
to
something
you
remember
that
story
i
read
to
you
one
night
that
yarn
about
the
fellow
that
lived
alone
in
the
hills
and
how
the
wolves
used
to
come
and
sit
on
the
ridge
and
howl
o
nights
you
know
the
one
you
said
was
uh
sight
they
took
it
all
right
and
here
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
tossed
the
letter
over
to
gene
who
caught
it
just
as
it
was
about
to
be
swept
into
the
flame
with
the
draught
in
thurston
in
the
days
which
he
spent
one
of
the
lazy
eight
with
gene
down
by
the
river
had
been
writing
of
the
west
writing
in
fear
and
trembling
for
now
he
knew
how
great
was
his
subject
and
his
ignorance
of
it
in
the
long
evenings
while
the
fire
crackled
and
the
flames
played
a
game
they
had
invented
a
game
where
they
tried
which
could
leap
highest
up
the
great
chimney
while
the
north
wind
around
the
eaves
and
fine
frozen
snow
meal
swished
against
the
one
little
window
while
shivering
drifting
range
cattle
tramped
restlessly
through
the
sparse
seeking
comfort
where
was
naught
but
cold
and
snow
and
bitter
driving
wind
while
the
gray
wolves
hunted
in
packs
and
had
not
long
to
wait
for
their
supper
thurston
had
written
better
than
he
knew
he
had
sent
the
cold
of
the
blizzards
and
the
howl
of
the
wolves
he
had
sent
bits
of
the
plains
back
to
new
york
in
long
white
envelopes
and
the
editors
were
beginning
to
watch
for
his
white
envelopes
and
to
seize
them
eagerly
when
they
came
greedy
for
what
was
within
not
every
day
can
they
look
upon
a
few
typewritten
pages
and
see
the
spread
now
frowning
now
smiling
before
them
they
say
here
they
want
a
lot
the
same
brand
and
at
any
old
price
yuh
might
name
i
would
mind
writing
stories
gene
kicked
a
log
back
into
the
flame
where
it
would
do
the
most
good
his
big
figure
stood
out
sharply
against
the
glow
thurston
watching
him
meditatively
wanted
to
tell
him
that
he
was
the
sort
of
whom
good
stories
are
made
but
for
men
like
gene
strong
purposeful
brave
the
west
would
lose
half
its
charm
he
was
like
bob
in
many
ways
and
for
that
thurston
liked
him
and
stayed
with
him
in
the
when
he
might
have
been
taking
his
ease
at
the
home
ranch
it
was
wild
and
lonely
down
there
between
the
bare
hills
and
the
frozen
river
but
the
wildness
and
the
loneliness
appealed
to
him
it
was
primitive
and
at
times
uncomfortable
he
slept
in
a
bunk
built
against
the
wall
with
hard
boards
under
him
and
a
sod
roof
over
his
head
there
were
times
when
the
wind
blew
its
fiercest
and
rattled
dirt
down
into
his
face
unless
he
covered
it
with
a
blanket
and
every
other
day
he
had
to
wash
the
dishes
and
cook
and
when
it
was
gene
turn
to
cook
thurston
chopped
great
armloads
of
wood
for
the
fireplace
to
eat
nights
also
he
must
fare
forth
wrapped
to
the
eyes
and
help
gene
drive
back
the
cattle
which
drifted
into
the
river
bottom
lest
they
cross
the
river
on
the
ice
and
range
where
they
should
not
but
in
the
evenings
he
could
sit
in
the
and
listen
to
the
wind
and
to
the
coyotes
and
the
gray
wolves
and
weave
stories
that
even
the
most
of
editors
could
not
fail
to
find
convincing
by
day
he
could
push
the
that
held
his
typewriter
over
by
the
frosted
window
when
he
had
an
hour
or
two
to
spare
and
whang
away
at
a
rate
which
filled
gene
with
wonder
sometimes
he
rode
over
to
the
home
ranch
for
a
day
or
two
but
mona
was
away
studying
music
so
he
found
no
inducement
to
remain
and
drifted
back
to
the
little
cabin
by
the
river
and
to
gene
the
winter
settled
down
with
bared
teeth
like
a
and
never
a
chinook
came
to
temper
the
cold
and
give
respite
to
man
or
beast
blizzards
that
held
them
in
fear
of
their
lives
close
to
shelter
for
days
came
down
from
the
north
and
with
them
came
the
drifting
herds
by
hundreds
they
came
hurrying
miserably
before
the
storms
when
the
wind
lashed
them
without
mercy
even
in
the
they
pushed
reluctantly
out
upon
the
ice
of
the
missouri
then
gene
and
thurston
watching
from
their
cabin
window
would
ride
out
and
turn
them
pitilessly
back
into
the
teeth
of
the
storm
they
came
by
hundreds
thin
gaunt
from
cold
and
hunger
they
came
by
thousands
lowing
their
misery
as
they
wandered
aimlessly
seeking
that
which
none
might
find
food
and
shelter
and
warmth
for
their
chilled
bodies
when
the
canada
herds
pushed
down
upon
them
the
boys
gave
over
trying
to
keep
them
north
of
the
river
while
they
turned
one
bunch
a
dozen
others
were
straggling
out
from
shore
the
timid
following
single
file
behind
a
leader
more
venturesome
or
more
desperate
than
his
fellows
so
the
march
went
on
and
on
big
steer
grappling
the
problem
of
his
first
northern
winter
cow
with
shivering
calf
trailing
at
her
heels
humpbacked
yearling
with
little
nubs
of
horns
telling
that
he
was
lately
in
his
calfhood
red
cattle
spotted
cattle
white
cattle
black
cattle
herefords
scrubs
texas
longhorns
of
the
sort
invariably
pictured
in
stampedes
still
they
came
drifting
out
of
the
cold
wilderness
and
on
into
wilderness
as
cold
through
the
shifting
wall
of
the
worst
blizzard
that
season
thurston
watched
the
weary
fruitless
endless
march
of
the
range
do
they
all
come
from
he
exclaimed
once
when
the
lifted
and
showed
the
river
black
with
cattle
i
dunno
gene
answered
shrugging
his
shoulders
against
the
pity
of
it
seen
some
brands
yesterday
that
i
know
belongs
up
in
the
cypress
hills
country
if
things
do
loosen
up
pretty
soon
the
whole
darned
range
will
be
swept
clean
uh
stock
as
far
north
as
cattle
run
i
looking
for
reindeer
ought
to
be
done
thurston
declared
uneasily
turning
away
from
the
sight
had
the
bellowing
of
starving
cattle
in
my
ears
day
and
night
for
nearly
a
month
the
thing
getting
on
my
getting
on
the
nerves
uh
them
that
own
a
heap
worse
gene
told
him
grimly
and
piled
more
wood
on
the
fire
for
the
cold
bit
through
even
the
thick
walls
of
the
cabin
when
the
flames
in
the
fireplace
died
and
the
door
hinges
were
crusted
deep
with
ice
going
to
be
the
biggest
loss
this
range
has
ever
the
owners
fault
snapped
thurston
whose
nerves
were
in
that
irritable
state
which
calls
loudly
for
a
vent
of
some
sort
even
argument
with
gene
fruitless
though
it
perforce
must
be
would
be
a
relief
their
own
fault
i
do
pity
them
any
why
do
they
take
care
of
their
stock
if
i
owned
cattle
do
you
think
i
sit
in
the
house
and
watch
them
starve
through
the
winter
if
yuh
owned
more
than
yuh
could
feed
it
be
a
case
uh
then
there
fifty
thousand
lazy
eight
cattle
walking
the
range
somewhere
today
how
the
dickens
is
old
hank
going
to
feed
them
fifty
thousand
or
five
thousand
it
takes
every
spear
uh
hay
he
got
to
feed
his
could
buy
hay
thurston
persisted
hay
for
fifty
thousand
cattle
where
would
he
get
it
say
bud
i
guess
yuh
do
realize
that
some
cattle
all
ails
you
is
yuh
savvy
the
size
uh
the
thing
i
bet
yuh
there
wo
be
less
than
three
hundred
thousand
head
cross
this
river
before
of
them
belong
in
canada
you
said
so
know
it
but
look
at
all
the
country
south
of
us
all
the
other
cow
states
why
bud
when
yuh
talk
about
feeding
every
critter
that
runs
the
range
you
plumb
it
a
damnable
pity
thurston
asserted
petulantly
it
is
the
grass
is
there
but
it
under
fourteen
inches
uh
snow
right
now
and
more
coming
they
say
it
twelve
feet
deep
up
in
the
mountains
you
see
some
great
old
times
in
the
spring
bud
if
yuh
stay
you
will
wo
yuh
thurston
laughed
shortly
suppose
it
safe
to
say
i
will
he
answered
ought
to
have
gone
last
fall
but
i
did
it
will
probably
be
the
same
thing
over
again
i
ought
to
go
in
the
spring
but
i
bet
you
wo
talk
about
big
roundups
what
yuh
seen
last
spring
was
a
commencement
every
hoof
that
crosses
this
river
and
lives
till
spring
will
have
to
be
rounded
up
and
brought
back
again
they
be
scattered
clean
down
to
the
yellowstone
and
every
northern
outfit
has
got
to
go
down
and
help
work
the
range
from
there
back
i
tell
yuh
bud
yuh
want
to
lay
in
a
uh
films
and
throw
away
all
them
little

one
night
in
late
march
a
sullen
faraway
roar
awakened
thurston
in
his
bunk
he
turned
over
and
listened
wondering
what
on
earth
was
the
matter
more
than
anything
it
sounded
like
a
hurrying
freight
train
only
the
railroad
lay
many
miles
to
the
north
and
trains
do
not
run
at
large
over
the

snored
peacefully
an
arm
length
away
outside
the
snow
lay
deep
on
the
levels
while
in
the
hollows
were
great
white
drifts
that
at
bedtime
had
glittered
frostily
in
the
moonlight
on
the
the
gray
wolves
howled
across
coulees
to
their
neighbors
and
slinking
coyotes
yapped
foolishly
at
the
moon
thurston
drew
the
blanket
up
over
his
ears
for
the
fire
had
died
to
a
heap
of
whitening
embers
and
the
cold
of
the
cabin
made
the
nose
of
him
tingle
the
roar
grew
louder
and
the
cabin
shivered
and
creaked
in
the
suddenness
of
the
blast
that
struck
it
a
clod
of
dirt
plumbed
down
upon
his
shoulder
bringing
with
it
a
shower
of
finer
particles
blizzard
he
groaned
the
worst
we
had
yet
by
the
the
wind
shrieked
down
the
chimney
and
sought
the
places
where
the
chinking
was

gene
flopped
over
like
a
newly
landed
fish
grunted
some
unintelligible
words
and
slept
again
for
an
hour
thurston
lay
and
listened
to
the
blast
and
selfishly
thanked
heaven
it
was
his
turn
at
the
cooking
if
the
storm
kept
up
like
that
he
told
himself
he
was
glad
he
did
not
have
to
chop
the
wood
he
lifted
the
blanket
and
sniffed
tentatively
then
cuddled
back
into
cover
swearing
that
a
thermometer
would
register
zero
at
that
very
moment
on
his
pillow
the
storm
came
in
gusts
as
the
worst
blizzards
do
at
times
it
made
him
think
of
the
nursery
story
about
the
fifth
little
pig
who
built
a
cabin
of
rocks
and
how
the
wolf
threatened
huff
and
i
puff
and
i
blow
your
house
down
it
was
as
if
he
himself
were
the
fifth
little
pig
and
as
if
the
wind
were
the
wolf
the
would
stop
for
whole
minutes
gather
his
great
lungs
full
of
air
and
then
without
warning
would
and
his
hardest
but
though
the
cabin
was
not
built
of
rocks
it
was
nevertheless
a
staunch
little
shelter
and
sturdily
withstood
the
shocks
he
pitied
the
poor
cattle
still
fighting
famine
and
frost
as
only
stock
can
fight
he
pictured
them
drifting
miserably
before
the
fury
of
the
wind
or
crowding
for
shelter
under
some
friendly
cutback
their
tails
to
the
storm
waiting
stolidly
for
the
dawn
that
would
bring
no
relief
then
with
the
roar
and
rattle
in
his
ears
he
fell
asleep
in
that
particular
on
the
missouri
the
cook
duties
began
with
building
a
fire
in
the
morning
thurston
waked
reluctantly
shivered
in
anticipation
under
the
blankets
gathered
together
his
fortitude
and
crept
out
of
his
bunk
while
he
was
dressing
his
teeth
chattered
like
castanets
in
a
minstrel
show
he
lighted
the
fire
hurriedly
and
stood
backed
close
before
it
listening
to
the
rage
of
the
wind
he
was
growing
very
tired
of
the
monotony
of
winter
he
could
no
longer
see
any
beauty
in
the
hills
nor
the
bare
red
faces
of
the
cliffs
frowning
down
upon
him
do
suppose
you
could
see
to
the
river

he
mused
gene
will
certainly
tear
the
third
commandment
to
shreds
before
he
gets
the
he
went
over
to
the
window
meaning
to
scratch
a
in
the
frost
just
as
he
had
done
every
day
for
the
past
three
months
lifted
a
hand
then
stopped
bewildered
for
instead
of
frost
there
was
only
steam
with
ridges
of
ice
yet
clinging
to
the
sash
and
dripping
water
in
a
tiny
rivulet
he
wiped
the
steam
hastily
away
with
his
palm
and
looked
out
heavens
gene
he
shouted
in
a
voice
to
wake
the

knuckled
his
eyes
and
sat
up
struck
us
in
the
night
did
yuh
hear
it
thurston
pulled
open
the
door
and
stood
face
to
face
with
the
miracle
of
the
west
he
had
seen
mother
nature
in
many
a
changeful
mood
but
never
like
this
the
wind
blew
warm
from
the
southwest
and
carried
hints
of
green
things
growing
and
the
song
of
birds
he
breathed
it
gratefully
into
his
lungs
and
let
it
riot
in
his
hair
the
sky
was
purplish
and
soft
with
heavy
drifting
clouds
like
a
summer
storm
it
looked
like
rain
he
thought
the
bare
hills
were
sodden
with
and
the
drifts
in
the
coulees
were
and
forbidding
the
great
river
lay
a
gray
stretch
of
snow
over
the
ice
with
little
clear
pools
reflecting
the
drab
clouds
above
a
crow
flapped
lazily
across
the
foreground
and
perched
like
a
blot
of
ink
on
the
top
of
a
dead
cottonwood
and
cawed
raucous
greeting
to
the
spring
the
wonder
of
it
dazed
thurston
and
made
him
do
unusual
things
that
morning
all
winter
he
had
been
puffed
with
pride
over
his
cooking
but
now
he
scorched
the
oatmeal
let
the
coffee
boil
over
and
blackened
the
bacon
and
committed
divers
other
grievous
sins
against
gene
clamoring
appetite
nor
did
he
feel
the
shame
that
he
should
have
felt
he
simply
could
not
stay
in
the
cabin
five
minutes
at
a
time
and
for
it
he
had
no
apology
after
breakfast
he
left
the
dishes
upon
the
table
and
went
out
and
made
merry
with
nature
he
could
scarce
believe
that
yesterday
he
had
frosted
his
left
ear
while
he
brought
a
bucket
of
water
up
from
the
river
and
that
it
had
made
his
lungs
ache
to
breathe
the
chill
air
now
the
path
to
the
river
was
black
and
dry
and
steamed
with
warmth
across
the
water
cattle
were
feeding
greedily
upon
the
brown
grasses

only
a
few
hours
before

chapter
xi
following
the
dim
trails
thurston
did
not
go
on
the
horse
roundup
he
explained
to
the
boys
when
they
clamored
against
his
staying
that
he
had
a
host
of
things
to
write
and
it
would
keep
him
busy
till
they
were
ready
to
start
with
the
wagons
for
the
big
rendezvous
on
the
yellowstone
the
exact
point
of
which
had
yet
to
be
decided
upon
by
the
stock
association
when
it
met
the
editors
were
after
him
he
said
and
if
he
ever
expected
to
get
anywhere
in
a
literary
sense
it
him
to
keep
on
the
smiley
side
of
the
editors
that
sounded
all
right
as
far
as
it
went
but
unfortunately
it
did
not
go
far
the
boys
winked
at
one
another
gravely
behind
his
back
and
jerked
their
thumbs
knowingly
toward
milk
river
by
which
pantomime
they
reminded
one
another
quite
unnecessarily
that
mona
stevens
had
come
home
however
they
kept
their
skepticism
from
becoming
obtrusive
so
that
thurston
believed
his
excuses
passed
on
their
face
value
the
boys
it
would
seem
realized
that
it
is
against
human
nature
for
a
man
to
declare
openly
to
his
fellows
his
intention
of
laying
last
desperate
siege
to
the
heart
of
a
girl
who
has
already
refused
him
three
times
and
to
ask
her
for
the
fourth
time
if
she
will
reconsider
her
former
decisions
and
marry
him
that
is
really
what
kept
thurston
at
the
lazy
eight
his
writing
became
once
more
a
mere
incident
in
his
life
during
the
winter
when
he
did
not
see
her
he
could
bring
himself
to
think
occasionally
of
other
things
and
it
is
a
fact
that
the
stories
he
wrote
with
no
heroine
at
all
hit
the
mark
the
straightest
now
when
he
was
once
again
under
the
spell
of
big
clear
blue
gray
eyes
and
crimply
brown
hair
his
stories
lost
something
of
their
virility
and
verged
upon
the
sentimental
in
tone
and
since
he
was
not
a
fool
he
realized
the
falling
off
and
chafed
against
it
and
wondered
why
it
was
surely
a
man
who
is
in
love
should
be
well
qualified
to
write
convincingly
of
the
obsession
but
thurston
did
not
he
came
near
going
to
the
other
extreme
and
refusing
to
write
at
all
the
wagons
were
out
two
weeks
which
is
quite
long
enough
for
a
crisis
to
arise
in
the
love
affair
of
any
man
by
the
time
the
horse
roundup
was
over
one
philip
thurston
was
in
pessimistic
mood
and
quite
ready
to
follow
the
wagons
the
farther
the
better
also
they
could
not
start
too
soon
to
please
him
his
thoughts
still
ran
to
eyes
and
ripply
hair
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
put
them
into
a
story
he
packed
his
trunk
carefully
with
everything
he
would
not
need
on
the
roundup
and
his
typewriter
he
put
in
the
middle
he
told
himself
bitterly
that
he
had
done
with
crimply
haired
girls
and
with
every
other
sort
of
girl
if
he
could
figure
in
something
heroic
only
he
said
melodramatic
he
might
possibly
force
her
to
think
well
of
him
but
heroic
situations
and
opportunities
come
not
every
day
to
a
man
and
girls
who
demand
that
their
knights
shall
be
brave
in
face
of
death
need
not
complain
if
they
are
left
knightless
at
the
last
he
wrote
to
the
night
before
they
were
to
start
and
apologized
gracefully
for
having
neglected
him
during
the
past
three
weeks
and
told
him
he
would
certainly
be
home
in
another
month
he
said
that
he
was
danger
of
being
satiated
with
the
western
and
would
be
glad
to
shake
the
hand
of
civilized
man
once
more
this
was
distinctly
unfair
because
he
had
no
quarrel
with
the
masculine
portion
of
the
west
if
he
had
said
civilized
woman
it
would
have
been
more
just
and
more
illuminating
to
who
wondered
what
scrape
phil
had
gotten
himself
into
with
those
savages
for
the
first
few
days
of
the
trip
thurston
was
in
that
frame
of
mind
which
makes
a
man
want
to
ride
by
himself
with
shoulders
hunched
moodily
and
eyes
staring
straight
before
the
nose
of
his
horse
but
the
sky
was
soft
and
seemed
to
smile
down
at
him
and
the
clouds
loitered
in
the
blue
of
it
and
drifted
aimlessly
with
no
thought
of
reaching
harbor
on
the
from
under
his
horse
feet
the
prairie
sod
sent
up
sweet
earthy
odors
into
his
nostrils
and
the
tinkle
of
the
bells
in
the
behind
him
made
music
in
his
ears
the
sort
of
music
a
true
cowboy
loves
meadow
larks
perched
swaying
in
the
top
of
gray
sage
bushes
and
sang
to
him
that
the
world
was
good
sober
gray
curlews
circled
over
his
head
their
long
funny
bills
thrust
out
straight
as
if
to
point
the
way
for
their
bodies
to
follow
and
cried
which
means
just
what
the
meadow
larks
sang
so
thurston
hearing
it
all
about
him
seeing
it
and
smelling
it
and
feeling
the
riot
of
spring
in
his
blood
straightened
the
hunch
out
of
his
shoulders
and
admitted
that
it
was
all
true
that
the
world
was
good
at
miles
city
he
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
small
army
the
regulars
of

hourly
larger
as

outfits
rolled
in

got
out
his
camera
and
took
pictures
of
the
scene
in
the
first
ten
different
camps

mourned
because
two
others
were
perforced
omitted
two
hours
later
he
snapped
the
kodak
upon

and
there
were

along

what
he
was
doing
and
laughed

till

said
yuh

off
and
left
him
peering
into

came
from

sent
their

it

never

a
night
the
cowboys
made

in

while
their
foremen
consulted

the
captains
appointed
by
the
association
mapped
out
the
different

at
times

for
all
calves
were
branded
as
they
were
gathered
many
there
were
among
the
that
would
not
cross
the
river
again
their
carcasses
made
unsightly
blots
in
the
and
on
the
levels
of
the
calves
that
had
followed
their
mothers
on
the
long
trail
hundreds
had
dropped
out
of
the
march

been
left
behind

the
calf
when
fifteen
hundred
head
of
mixed
stock
bearing
northern
brands
were
in
the
hands
of
the
park
and
his
crew
were
detailed
to
take
them
on
and
turn
them
loose
upon
their
own
range
north
of
milk
river
thurston
felt
that
he
had
gleaned
about
all
the
experience
he
needed
and
more
than
enough
hard
riding
and
short
sleeping
and
hurried
eating
he
announced
that
he
was
ready
to
bid
to
the
range
he
would
help
take
the
herd
home
he
told
park
and
then
he
intended
to
hit
the
trail
for
little
old
new
york
he
still
agreed
with
the
meadow
larks
that
the
world
was
good
but
he
had
made
himself
believe
that
he
really
thought
the
civilized
portion
of
it
was
better
especially
when
the
uncivilized
part
holds
a
girl
who
persists
in
saying
no
when
she
should
undoubtedly
say
yes
and
insists
that
a
man
must
be
a
hero
else
she
will
have
none

chapter
xii
high
water
it
was
nearing
the
middle
of
june
and
it
was
getting
to
be
a
very
hot
june
at
that
for
two
days
the
had
toiled
wearily
over
the
hills
and
across
the
coulees
between
the
missouri
and
milk
river
then
the
sky
threatened
for
a
day
and
after
that
they
plodded
in
the
rain
the
lord
that
done
with
sighed
park
when
he
saw
the
last
of
the
herd
climb
all
dripping
up
the
north
bank
of
the
milk
river
we
can
turn
loose
and
i
tell
yuh
bud
we
did
get
across
none
too
soon
yuh
notice
how
the
river
coming
up
a
day
later
and
we
have
had
to
hold
the
herd
on
the
other
side
no
telling
how
is
higher
than
usual
i
noticed
that
thurston
agreed
absently
he
was
thinking
more
of
mona
just
then
than
of
the
river
he
wondered
if
she
would
be
at
home
he
could
easily
ride
down
there
and
find
out
it
was
far
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
but
he
assured
himself
that
he
was
going
and
that
he
was
not
quite
a
fool
he
hoped
even
if
she
were
at
home
what
good
could
that
possibly
do
him
just
give
him
several
bad
nights
when
he
would
lie
in
his
corner
of
the
tent
and
listen
to
the
boys
snoring
with
a
different
key
for
every
man
such
nights
were
not
pleasant
nor
were
the
thoughts
that
caused
them
from
where
they
were
camped
upon
a
ridge
which
bounded
a
broad
coulee
on
the
east
he
could
look
down
upon
the
stevens
ranch
nestling
in
the
bottomland
the
house
half
hidden
among
the
cottonwoods
through
the
last
hours
of
the
afternoon
he
watched
it
hungrily
the
big
corral
ran
down
to
the
water
edge
and
he
noted
idly
that
three
panels
of
the
fence
extended
out
into
the
river
and
that
the
muddy
water
was
creeping
steadily
up
until
at
sundown
the
posts
of
the
first
panel
barely
showed
above
the
water
park
came
up
to
him
and
looked
down
upon
the
little
valley
never
did
see
any
sense
in
jack
stevens
building
where
he
did
he
remarked
ai
a
june
flood
that
do
put
his
corral
under
water
and
some
uh
these
days
it
going
to
get
the
house
he
was
too
lazy
to
dig
a
well
back
on
high
ground
he
rather
take
chances
on
having
the
whole
business
washed
off
the
face
uh
the
must
be
danger
of
it
this
year
if
ever
thurston
observed
uneasily
river
is
coming
up
pretty
fast
it
seems
to
me
it
must
have
raised
three
feet
since
we
crossed
this
course
there
danger
with
all
that
snow
coming
out
uh
the
mountains
and
like
as
not
jack
in
shellanne
roosting
on
pool
table
and
telling
it
scary
instead
uh
staying
at
home
looking
after
his
stuff
where
yuh
going
bud
going
to
ride
down
there
thurston
answered
constrainedly
women
may
be
all
i
go
along
if
you
hold
on
a
minute
jack
ai
got
a
lick
uh
sense
i
do
care
if
he
is
mona
brother
corrected
thurston
as
he
swung
up
into
the
saddle
he
had
a
poor
opinion
of
jack
and
resented
even
that
slight
relation
to
mona
the
road
was
soggy
with
the
rain
which
fell
steadily
down
in
the
bottom
the
low
places
in
the
road
were
already
under
water
and
the
river
widening
almost
perceptibly
in
its
headlong
rush
down
the
narrow
valley
crept
inch
by
inch
up
its
low
banks
when
they
galloped
into
the
yard
which
sloped
from
the
house
gently
down
to
the
river
fifty
yards
away
mona
face
appeared
for
a
moment
in
the
window
evidently
she
had
been
watching
for
some
one
and
thurston
heart
flopped
in
his
chest
as
he
wondered
fleetingly
if
it
could
be
himself
when
she
opened
the
door
her
eyes
greeted
him
with
a
certain
wistful
expression
that
he
had
never
seen
in
them
before
he
was
guilty
of
wishing
that
park
had
stayed
in
camp
i
glad
you
rode
over
she
welcomed
but
she
was
careful
after
that
first
swift
glance
to
look
at
park
was
at
camp
was
he
he
went
to
town
this
morning
and
i
looked
for
hi
back
long
before
now
but
it
a
mistake
ever
to
look
for
jack
until
he
actually
in
park
smiled
vaguely
he
was
afraid
it
would
not
be
polite
to
agree
with
her
as
emphatically
as
he
would
like
to
have
done
but
thurston
had
no
smile
ready
polite
or
otherwise
instead
he
drew
down
his
brows
in
a
way
not
complimentary
to
jack
is
your
mother
he
asked
almost
peremptorily
went
to
great
falls
last
week
she
told
him
primly
just
grazing
him
with
one
of
her
impersonal
glances
which
nearly
drove
him
to
desperation
mary
has
typhoid
fever
there
seems
to
be
so
much
of
that
this
spring
and
they
sent
for
mamma
she
such
a
splendid
nurse
you
thurston
did
know
but
he
passed
over
the
subject
you
alone
he
demanded
not
are
you
two
here
mona
could
be
very
pert
when
she
tried
and
i
are
holding
down
the
ranch
just
now
the
boys
are
all
on
roundup
of
course
jack
went
to
town
today
to
see
some
one
of
it
was
park
still
trying
to
be
polite
and
not
commit
himself
on
the
subject
of
jack
the
whom
jack
went
oftenest
to
see
was
the
bartender
in
the
palace
saloon
but
it
was
not
necessary
to
tell
her
that
river
coming
up
pretty
fast
mona
he
ventured
yuh
think
yuh
ought
to
pull
out
and
go
visiting
i
mona
tone
was
very
decided
would
drop
down
on
a
neighbor
without
warning
just
because
the
river
happens
to
be
coming
up
it
has
up
every
june
since
we
been
living
here
and
there
have
been
several
of
them
at
the
worst
it
never
came
inside
the
can
never
tell
what
it
might
do
park
argued
know
yourself
there
never
been
so
much
snow
in
the
mountains
this
hot
weather
been
having
lately
and
then
the
rain
will
bring
it
yuh
ride
over
to
the
jonses
one
of
us
go
with
i
mona
chin
went
up
perversely
no
coward
i
hope
even
if
there
was
any
danger
which
there
thurston
chin
went
up
also
and
he
sat
a
bit
straighter
whether
she
meant
it
or
not
he
took
her
words
as
a
covert
stab
at
himself
probably
she
did
not
mean
it
at
any
rate
the
blood
flew
consciously
to
her
cheeks
after
she
had
spoken
and
she
caught
her
under
lip
sharply
between
her
teeth
and
that
did
not
help
matters
or
make
her
temper
more
yielding
she
added
hurriedly
will
be
here
he
likely
to
come
any
minute
course
if
jack
got
some
new
kind
of
he
can
put
on
the
river
and
hold
it
back
yuh
be
all
right
fleered
park
with
the
freedom
of
an
old
friend
he
had
known
mona
when
she
wore
dresses
to
her
and
her
hair
in
long
brown
curls
down
her
back
she
wrinkled
her
nose
at
him
also
with
the
freedom
of
an
old
friend
and
thurston
stirred
restlessly
in
his
chair
he
did
not
like
even
park
to
be
too
familiar
with
mona
though
he
knew
there
was
a
girl
in
shellanne
whose
name
park
sometimes
spoke
in
his
sleep
she
lifted
the
big
glass
lamp
down
from
its
place
on
the
clock
shelf
and
lighted
it
with
fingers
not
quite
steady
men
she
remarked
women
ought
to
be
wrapped
in
pink
cotton
and
put
in
a
glass
cabinet
if
by
any
miracle
the
river
should
come
up
around
the
house
i
flatter
myself
i
should
be
able
to
cope
with
the
situation
i
just
saddle
my
horse
and
ride
out
to
high
ground
yuh
park
grinned
skeptically
road
from
here
to
the
hill
is
half
under
water
right
now
the
river
got
over
the
bank
above
and
is
flooding
down
through
the
horse
pasture
by
the
time
the
water
got
up
here
the
river
be
as
wide
and
deep
one
side
uh
yuh
as
the
other
then
where
yuh
be
at
wo
get
up
here
though
mona
asserted
coolly
never
and
the
lazy
eight
never
had
to
work
the
yellowstone
range
on
spring
roundup
before
either
park
told
her
meaningly
whereupon
mona
got
upon
her
pedestal
and
smiled
her
unpleasant
smile
against
which
even
park
had
no
argument
ready
they
lingered
till
long
after
all
good
cowpunchers
are
supposed
to
be
in
their
beds
unless
they
are
standing
but
jack
failed
to
appear
the
rain
drummed
upon
the
roof
and
the
river
swished
and
gurgled
against
the
crumbling
banks
and
grumbled
audibly
to
itself
because
the
hills
stood
immovably
in
their
places
and
set
bounds
which
it
could
not
pass
however
much
it
might
rage
against
their
base
when
the
clock
struck
a
wheezy
nine
mona
glanced
at
it
significantly
and
smothered
a
yawn
more
than
half
affected
it
was
a
hint
which
no
man
with
an
atom
of
could
overlook
with
mutual
understanding
the
two
rose
guess
we
have
to
be
going
park
said
with
some
ceremony
kept
think
ing
maybe
jack
would
show
up
it
ai
right
to
leave
yuh
here
alone
like
do
see
why
not
i
not
the
least
bit
afraid
mona
said
her
tone
was
impersonal
and
had
in
it
a
note
of
dismissal
so
there
being
nothing
else
that
they
could
do
they
said
and
took
themselves
off
is
sure
fierce
park
grumbled
when
they
struck
the
lower
ground
a
man
like
jack
stevens
he
hang
out
there
in
town
and
bowl
up
on
other
men
money
till
plumb
daylight
it
a
wonder
mona
did
go
with
her
mother
but
no
it
be
awful
if
jack
had
to
cook
his
own
grub
for
a
week
say
the
water
has
come
up
a
lot
do
yuh
think
bud
if
it
raises
much
more
mona
sure
have
a
chance
to
with
the
situation
it
just
about
serve
her
right
thurston
did
not
think
so
but
he
was
in
too
dispirited
a
mood
to
argue
the
point
it
had
not
been
good
for
his
peace
of
mind
to
sit
and
watch
the
color
come
and
go
in
mona
cheeks
and
the
laughter
spring
unheralded
into
her
dear
big
eyes
and
the
light
tangle
itself
in
the
waves
of
her
hair
he
guided
his
horse
carefully
through
the
deep
places
and
noted
uneasily
how
much
deeper
it
was
than
when
they
had
crossed
before
he
cursed
the
conventions
which
forbade
his
staying
and
watching
over
the
girl
back
there
in
the
house
which
already
stood
upon
an
island
cut
off
from
the
safe
high
land
by
a
strip
of
backwater
that
was
widening
and
deepening
every
minute
and
when
it
rose
high
enough
to
flow
into
the
river
below
would
have
a
current
that
would
make
a
nasty
crossing
on
the
first
rise
he
stopped
and
looked
back
at
the
light
which
shone
out
from
among
the
dripping
cottonwoods
even
then
he
was
tempted
to
go
back
and
brave
her
anger
that
he
might
feel
assured
of
her
safety
come
on
park
cried
impatiently
ca
do
any
good
sitting
out
here
in
the
rain
i
do
suppose
the
water
will
get
clear
up
to
the
house
it
likely
do
things
to
the
sheds
and
corrals
though
and
serve
jack
right
come
on
bud
mona
wo
have
us
around
so
the
sooner
we
get
under
cover
the
better
for
us
she
got
lots
uh
nerve
i
guess
she
make
out
all
there
was
common
sense
in
the
argument
and
thurston
recognized
it
and
rode
on
to
camp
but
instead
of
unsaddling
as
he
would
naturally
have
done
he
tied
sunfish
to
the
and
threw
his
slicker
over
his
back
to
protect
him
from
the
rain
and
though
park
said
nothing
he
followed
thurston
example
chapter
xiii
stay
for
a
long
time
thurston
lay
with
eyes
staring
up
at
nothing
listening
to
the
rain
and
thinking
by
and
by
the
rain
ceased
and
he
could
tell
by
the
dim
whiteness
of
the
tent
roof
that
the
clouds
must
have
been
swept
away
from
before
the
moon
then
just
past
the
full
he
got
up
carefully
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
others
and
crept
over
two
or
three
sleeping
forms
on
his
way
to
the
opening
untied
the
flap
and
went
out
the
whole
hilltop
and
the
valley
below
were
bathed
in
mellow
radiance
he
studied
critically
the
wide
sweep
of
the
river
he
might
almost
have
thought
it
the
missouri
itself
it
stretched
so
far
from
bank
to
bank
indeed
it
seemed
to
know
no
banks
but
the
hills
themselves
he
turned
toward
where
the
light
had
shone
among
the
cottonwoods
below
there
was
nothing
but
a
great
blot
of
shade
that
told
him
nothing
a
step
sounded
just
behind
a
hand
the
hand
of
park
rested
upon
his
shoulder
kinda
dubious
do
it
kid
was
yuh
thinking
about
riding
down
there
thurston
answered
simply
you
coming
park
assented
they
got
upon
their
horses
and
headed
down
the
trail
to
the
stevens
place
thurston
would
have
put
sunfish
to
a
run
but
park
checked
him
easy
he
admonished
there
swimming
to
be
done
and
it
a
cinch
there
will
be
he
going
to
need
all
the
wind
he
down
the
hill
they
stopped
at
the
edge
of
a
raging
torrent
and
strained
their
eyes
to
see
what
lay
on
the
other
side
while
they
looked
a
light
twinkled
out
from
among
the
thurston
caught
his
breath
sharply
upstairs
he
said
and
his
voice
sounded
strained
and
unnatural
just
a
loft
where
they
store
he
started
to
ride
into
the
flood
on
back
here
yuh
chump
park
roared
off
and
loosen
the
cinch
before
yuh
go
in
there
or
yuh
wo
get
far
sunfish
need
room
to
breathe
once
he
gets
to
bucking
that
current
he
a
good
water
horse
just
give
him
his
head
and
do
get
rattled
and
interfere
with
him
and
we
got
to
go
up
a
ways
before
we
start
he
led
the
way
upstream
skirting
under
the
bluff
and
thurston
chafing
against
the
delay
followed
obediently
trees
were
racing
down
their
roots
reaching
up
in
a
tangle
from
the
water
their
branches
waving
like
imploring
arms
a
black
shack
went
scudding
past
lodged
upon
a
ridge
where
the
water
was
shallower
and
sat
there
swaying
drunkenly
upon
it
a
great
yellow
cat
clung
and
yowled
his
fear
old
dutch
henry
house
park
shouted
above
the
roar
bet
he
cussing
things
blue
on
some
pinnacle
up
he
laughed
at
the
picture
his
imagination
conjured
and
rode
out
into
the
swirl
thurston
kept
close
behind
mindful
of
park
command
to
give
sunfish
his
head
sunfish
had
carried
him
safely
out
of
the
stampede
and
he
had
no
fear
of
him
now
his
chief
thought
was
a
wish
that
he
might
do
this
thing
quite
alone
he
was
jealous
of
park
leading
and
thought
bitterly
that
mona
would
thank
park
alone
and
pass
him
by
with
scant
praise
and
he
did
so
want
to
vindicate
himself
the
next
minute
he
was
cursing
his
damnable
selfishness
a
tree
had
swept
down
just
before
him
caught
park
and
his
horse
in
its
branches
and
hurried
on
as
if
ashamed
of
what
it
had
done
thurston
in
that
instant
came
near
jerking
sunfish
around
to
follow
but
he
checked
the
impulse
as
it
was
formed
and
left
the
reins
alone
which
was
wise
he
could
not
have
helped
park
and
he
could
very
easily
have
drowned
himself
though
it
was
not
thought
of
himself
but
of
mona
that
stayed
his
hand
they
landed
at
the
gate
sunfish
scrambled
with
his
feet
for
secure
footing
found
it
and
waded
up
to
the
front
door
the
water
was
a
foot
deep
on
the
porch
thurston
beat
an
imperative
tattoo
upon
the
door
with
the
butt
of
his
quirt
and
shouted
and
mona
voice
shorn
of
its
customary
assurance
answered
faintly
from
the
loft
he
shouted
again
giving
directions
in
a
tone
of
authority
which
must
have
sounded
strange
to
her
but
which
she
did
not
seem
to
resent
and
obeyed
without
protest
she
had
to
wade
from
the
stairs
to
the
door
and
when
thurston
stooped
and
lifted
her
up
in
front
of
him
she
looked
as
if
she
were
very
glad
to
have
him
there
did
with
the
situation
after
all
he
remarked
while
she
was
settling
herself
firmly
in
the
saddle
went
to
sleep
and
did
notice
the
water
till
it
was
coming
in
at
the
door
she
explained
then
she
stopped
abruptly
what
he
demanded
maliciously
you
afraid
little
she
confessed
reluctantly
thurston
gloated
over
it
in
silence
until
he
remembered
park
after
that
he
could
think
of
little
else
as
before
now
sunfish
battled
as
seemed
to
him
best
for
thurston
astride
behind
the
saddle
held
mona
somewhat
tighter
than
he
need
to
have
done
and
let
the
horse
go
so
long
as
sunfish
had
footing
he
braced
himself
against
the
mad
rush
of
waters
and
forged
ahead
but
out
where
the
current
ran
swimming
deep
he
floundered
desperately
under
his
double
burden
while
his
strength
lasted
he
kept
his
head
above
water
struggling
gamely
against
the
flood
that
lapped
over
his
back
and
bubbled
in
his
nostrils
thurston
felt
his
laboring
and
clutched
mona
still
tighter
of
a
sudden
the
horse
head
went
under
the
black
water
came
up
around
thurston
throat
with
a
hungry
swish
and
sunfish
went
out
from
under
him
like
an
eel
there
was
a
confused
roaring
in
his
ears
a
horrid
sense
of
suffocation
for
a
moment
but
he
had
learned
to
swim
when
he
was
a
boy
at
school
and
he
freed
one
hand
from
its
grip
on
mona
and
set
to
paddling
with
much
vigor
and
considerably
less
skill
and
though
the
clutched
him
and
the
weight
of
mona
taxed
his
strength
he
managed
to
keep
them
both
afloat
and
to
make
a
little
headway
until
the
deepest
part
lay
behind
them
how
thankful
he
was
when
his
feet
touched
bottom
no
one
but
himself
ever
knew
his
ears
hummed
from
the
water
in
them
and
the
roar
of
the
river
was
to
him
as
the
roar
of
the
sea
his
eyes
smarted
from
the
clammy
touch
of
the
dingy
froth
that
went
hurrying
by
in
monster
flakes
his
lungs
ached
and
his
heart
pounded
heavily
against
his
ribs
when
he
stopped
gasping
beyond
reach
of
the
that
lapped
viciously
behind
he
stood
a
minute
with
his
arm
still
around
her
and
coughed
his
voice
clear
went
down
he
began
hardly
knowing
what
it
was
he
was
saying
he
stopped
then
shouted
the
name
aloud
park
and
from
somewhere
down
the
river
came
a
faint
reassuring
whoop
the
lord
gasped
thurston
and
leaned
against
her
for
a
second
then
he
straightened
you
all
right
he
asked
and
drew
her
toward
a
rock
near
at
hand
for
in
truth
the
knees
of
him
were
shaking
they
sat
down
and
he
looked
more
closely
at
her
face
and
discovered
that
it
was
wet
with
something
more
than
river
water
mona
the
mona
the
was
crying
and
instinctively
he
knew
that
not
the
chill
alone
made
her
shiver
he
was
keeping
his
arm
around
her
waist
deliberately
and
it
pleased
him
that
she
let
it
stay
after
a
minute
she
did
something
which
surprised
him
mightily
and
pleased
him
more
she
dropped
her
face
down
against
the
soaked
lapels
of
his
coat
and
left
it
there
he
laid
a
hand
tenderly
against
her
cheek
and
wondered
if
he
dared
feel
so
happy
girl
oh
little
girl
he
said
softly
and
stopped
for
the
crowding
emotions
in
his
heart
and
brain
the
english
language
has
no
words
mona
lifted
her
face
and
looked
into
his
eyes
her
own
were
soft
and
shining
in
the
moonlight
and
she
was
smiling
a
little
the
roguish
little
smile
of
the
imitation
pastel
portrait
you
unpack
your
typewriter
wo
you
please
and
and
stay
thurston
crushed
her
close
the
will
never
get
rid
of
me
now
he
cried
jubilantly
wanted
to
take
me
into
the
lazy
eight
so
now
i
buy
an
interest
and
stay
dear
mona
snuggled
close
and
learned
how
it
feels
to
be
kissed
if
she
had
never
known
before
sunfish
having
scrambled
ashore
a
few
yards
farther
down
came
up
to
them
and
stood
waiting
as
if
to
be
forgiven
for
his
failure
to
carry
them
safe
to
land
but
thurston
after
the
first
inattentive
glance
ungratefully
took
no
heed
of
him
there
was
a
sound
of
scrambling
and
park
came
dripping
up
to
them
say
he
greeted
yuh
got
anything
to
do
but
set
here
and
er
look
at
the
moon
break
away
and
come
up
to
camp
i
rout
out
the
cook
and
make
him
boil
us
some
thurston
turned
joyfully
toward
him
old
fellow
i
was
better
reform
and
quit
being
afraid
park
bantered
got
out
uh
the
fine
but
i
guess
my
horse
went
on
down
poor
devil
i
was
poking
around
below
there
looking
for
mona
i
see
yuh
was
able
to
with
the
situation
all
right
but
yuh
needed
bud
mighty
bad
i
reckon
the
chances
is
yuh
have
no
house
in
the
morning
so
bud
have
to
get
busy
and
rustle
one
for
yuh
i
guess
you
own
up
now
that
the
water
can
get
through
the
he
laughed
in
his
teasing
way
mona
stood
up
and
her
shining
eyes
were
turned
to
thurston
care
she
asserted
with
reddened
cheeks
just
glad
it
did
get
here
said
thurston
with
much
emphasis
then
with
mona
once
more
in
the
saddle
and
with
thurston
leading
sunfish
by
the
they
trailed
damply
and
happily
up
the
long
ridge
to
where
the
white
tents
of
the
roundup
gleamed
sharply
against
the
