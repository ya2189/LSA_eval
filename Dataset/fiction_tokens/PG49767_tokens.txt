extensive

said
the

of

it
was
the
formal
word
and
the
scientists
were
silent
except
proudwalk
a
biologist
who
laughed
at
something
whispered
in
her
ear
by
a

named
snubnose
her

time
the

repeated
and
in
a
moment
even
proudwalk
was
quiet
and
snubnose
folded
his
arms
i
do
not
need
to
tell
you
that
today
is
the
day
of
the
candidate
said
the

supporting
himself

an
air
of
great
age
on
his
ceremonial
staff
of
polished
copper
but
he
will
tell
us
in

words
snubnose
whispered
now
next
winter
solstice
i
am
going
to
propose
we
double
the
offering
proudwalk
sniggered
it
was
the
practice
in
the
guild
of
scientists
that
a
grandmaster
once
elected
served
for
life
or
until
he
voluntarily
retired
every
year
the
body
formally
offered
its
grandmaster
a
lump
sum
to
retire
popular
incumbents
were
offered
one
tilsin
an
obsolete
unit
worth
less
than
the
smallest
real
coin
others
were
sometimes
offered
large
amounts
this
system
did
not
encourage
elderly
grandmasters
to
be
laconic
unnecessarily
consulting
his
notes
the
grandmaster
declaimed
on
this
day
of
the
candidate
the
day
of
the
year
dynastic
reckoning
corrected
snubnose
muttered
anybody
else
would
say
drc
proudwalk
patted
his
lips
hush
she
we
are
initiating
the
consideration
of
the
candidature
of
apprentice
physicist
in
the
service
of
crookback
a
master
physicist
beloved
and
esteemed
by
us
all
the
candidature
of
will
be
governed
by
the
principles
by
the
laws
of
the
guild
and
by
acknowledged
custom
the
procedure
while
the
grandmaster
talked
snubnose
pondered
the
familiar
procedure
and
some
implications
the
venerable
bore
did
concern
himself
with
to
become
a
journeyman
scientist
an
apprentice
had
to
do
two
things
he
had
to
complete
his
term
of
service
and
he
had
to
perform
on
a
day
of
the
candidate
a
successful
demonstration
in
his
own
branch
of
the
scientific
art
the
demonstration
always
took
place
on
the
field
of
proof
before
the
whole
body
it
could
be
either
an
original
experiment
or
a
restored
experiment
one
reconstructed
from
fragments
of
ancient
texts
standards
were
low
and
almost
anything
was
accepted
so
long
as
the
candidate
accomplished
what
he
said
he
would
if
a
conceited
or
as
occasionally
happened
a
gifted
young
man
attempted
a
very
complicated
demonstration
and
it
did
come
off
well
it
was
just
too
bad
the
unfortunate
candidate
could
either
serve
another
five
years
of
apprenticeship
and
try
again
or
give
up
all
connection
with
the
guild
if
he
left
the
guild
of
scientists
he
could
be
admitted
in
any
other
guild
which
was
no
laughing
matter
only
journeymen
and
masters
and
kingsmen
in
the
general
sense
both
men
and
women
had
full
rights
of
citizens
including
the
right
to
marry
by
public
law
others
might
get
married
by
private
law
but
that
was
a
rather
uncomfortable
method
under
private
law
a
man
and
a
woman
would
sign
a
contract
to
marry
and
if
they
succeeded
in
living
together
dwelling
under
the
same
roof
as
husband
and
wife
for
five
years
without
being
discovered
by
the
public
law
police
they
could
then
live
together
openly
they
would
then
be
as
legally
married
as
the
most
respectable
members
of
the
guild
of
merchants
but
if
the
public
law
police
caught
them
before
the
years
of
cover
were
completed
they
were
separated
and
sold
as
slaves
permission
of
all
the
parents
was
required
for
marriage
by
public
law
whatever
the
age
of
the
lovers
consequently
even
guildfolk
sometimes
took
their
chances
with
private
law
although
most
who
tried
it
ended
their
lives
threshing
rye
for
the
lords
of
the
west
for
example
singwell
and
snubnose
found
such
thoughts
painful
he
glanced
at
his
sister
and
wondered
how
she
could
go
on
looking
so
cheerful
but
i
suppose
i
look
cheerful
myself
he
thought
indeed
he
had
the
kind
of
face
that
could
look
otherwise
snubnose
followed
his
sister
eyes
to
the
candidate
stool
where
proudwalk
lover
and
his
friend
sat
indolently
with
his
long
legs
twisted
under
him
he
wondered
what
proudwalk
and
were
going
to
do
certainly
they
were
going
to
get
married
by
public
law
he
winced
as
he
remembered
the
furious
screams
of
his
mother
every
time
proudwalk
brought
up
the
question
snubnose
took
his
side
but
it
seemed
hopeless
to
win
their
mother
over
and
even
if
they
succeeded
it
would
do
any
good
was
going
to
qualify
for
journeyman
rank
because
he
had
stubbornly
insisted
on
a
demonstration
that
was
sure
to
fail
it
was
a
crazy
situation
snubnose
thought
here
he
himself
was
a
journeyman
and
here
was
his
sister
a
journeywoman
while
a
talented
fellow
like
would
remain
an
apprentice
or
become
a
guildless
outcast
for
that
difficulty
he
had
nobody
to
blame
but
himself
snubnose
reflected
in
the
virtuous
way
we
meditate
upon
the
mistakes
of
our
friends
now
the
grandmaster
was
introducing
crookback
master
and
as
late
as
the
previous
day
of
the
candidate
snubnose
master
as
well
snubnose
looked
at
the
old
man
more
affectionately
than
he
had
while
in
his
service
but
he
blamed
crookback
for
permitting
to
go
ahead
with
his
impossible
demonstration
he
was
puzzled
as
usual
by
the
motives
of
the
old
master
physicist
born
with
a
bent
body
and
a
clever
enigmatic
mind
a
few
formal
words
a
brief
joke
and
a
couple
of
compliments
and
crookback
presented
the
candidate
unwound
his
legs
and
stood
before
them
elder
ones
he
began
traditionally
and
snubnose
thought
he
caught
a
quick
impudent
look
was
young
the
three
of
them
were
young
together
in
their
city
and
their
time
but
he
was
two
years
older
than
snubnose
and
a
year
older
than
proudwalk
he
had
started
his
apprenticeship
a
little
later
than
was
usual
i
will
say
the
thing
i
will
attempt
the
thing
yours
elder
ones
to
judge
whether
the
thing
is
done
whether
i
am
worthy
to
sit
among
you
these
too
were
traditional
phrases
i
will
construct
a
chamber
he
said
casually
in
which
i
will
go
irreversibly
from
today
drc
to
a
day
in
the
future
drc
i
would
be
proud
to
claim
this
demonstration
as
my
own
discovery
but
it
is
not
it
is
a
restored
experiment
i
follow
the
directions
i
copied
while
still
a
boy
from
an
ancient
inscription
in
a
vault
outside
the
walls
the
vault
was
afterward
buried
by
the
earthquake
and
very
conveniently
too
snubnose
added
to
himself
had
not
admitted
it
even
to
him
but
snubnose
was
convinced
that
the
chamber
was
his
friend
own
invention
reverence
elder
ones
said
and
walked
to
the
arched
door
of
the
meeting
room
time
said
the
grandmaster
snubnose
rising
heard
a
conversation
behind
him
as
two
master
chemists
shuffled
to
their
feet
do
you
think
the
youngster
will
do
it
one
asked
well
there
a
tradition
about
it
the
other
said
yes
and
there
a
tradition
about
the
elixir
of
life
and
a
hundred
texts
as
well
and
you
remember
what
happened
to
the
young
fellow
who
tried
to
make
it
there
was
a
chuckle
i
remember
and
he
not
so
young
any
more
and
he
the
best
apprentice
i
have
for
washing
glassware
most
experience
proudwalk
had
heard
the
conversation
also
and
her
face
turned
red
she
raised
her
delicate
nose
quite
unlike
her
brother
snub
and
sniffed
loudly
i
think
i
smell
hydrogen
sulfide
she
said
carrying
his
copper
staff
the
grandmaster
paced
to
the
arched
doorway
followed
by
crookback
bowed
as
they
preceded
him
through
the
door
and
he
had
to
bend
his
head
again
to
pass
through
for
was
partly
of
bowman
stock
and
tall
for
a
man
of
the
city
the
masters
and
mistresses
of
the
guild
the
journeymen
and
journeywomen
filed
out
behind
the
candidate
in
the
order
of
their
seniority
when
proudwalk
and
her
brother
reached
the
street
of
the
scientists
already
the
kingsman
and
the
godsman
had
taken
their
places
to
the
right
and
the
left
of
the
grandmaster
in
the
foremost
rank
of
the
procession
the
kingsman
wore
his
second
gaudiest
uniform
the
most
splendid
was
reserved
for
coronations
and
carried
his
silver
mace
of
authority
the
godsman
was
naked
as
above
display
and
free
of
the
temptations
of
sex
he
carried
nothing
for
his
nakedness
was
his
badge
of
office
it
was
death
for
anyone
except
a
godsman
or
a
godswoman
to
be
found
in
a
public
place
unclothed
there
came
next
the
candidate
and
his
master
and
after
them
by
the
whole
body
of
scientists
proudwalk
and
snubnose
walked
together
the
last
pair
early
in
the
morning
snubnose
had
determined
to
cheer
up
his
sister
as
much
as
he
could
on
this
unhappy
day
now
she
walked
along
so
lightly
and
smiled
so
much
and
so
gaily
that
it
was
obvious
that
she
needed
no
cheering
snubnose
was
irritated
i
do
see
why
you
did
talk
him
out
of
it
he
said
he
might
have
listened
to
you
where
he
would
listen
to
me
he
has
the
odd
delusion
that
you
smarter
than
i
i
am
said
proudwalk
snubnose
growled
he
said
you
must
not
care
about
him
as
much
as
you
let
on
for
all
your
mooning
around
the
gardens
well
it
does
surprise
me
much
you
women
are
all
obsessed
with
family
pride
no
matter
how
liberal
you
pretend
to
be
of
course
you
ca
marry
whose
father
was
a
bowman
our
two
to
the
tenth
power
one
thousand
and
ancestors
all
pure
city
all
guildfolk
from
the
very
best
guilds
would
disturb
every
palace
in
spiritland
with
their
wailing
so
now
wo
qualify
and
it
will
be
an
easy
out
for
you
snubnose
you
know
that
not
true
but
i
tell
you
something
she
lowered
her
voice
i
told
not
to
listen
to
you
and
to
go
ahead
with
his
demonstration
but
why
even
if
you
are
only
a
biologist
you
ought
to
know
from
your
basic
studies
that
all
the
best
thinkers
in
physics
for
five
hundred
years
have
regarded
time
travel
as
a
physical
impossibility
and
all
old
traditions
of
time
travel
as
myths
oh
little
gods
whatever
we
ca
do
any
more
is
impossible
and
a
myth
we
just
wo
admit
we
are
not
as
good
scientists
as
our
remote
ancestors
but
some
of
us
are
as
good
or
even
better
by
all
the
gods
big
and
little
you
really
do
love
the
poor
fellow
he
good
but
not
that
good
what
will
you
do
now
wait
till
he
finishes
another
apprenticeship
and
hope
mother
changes
her
mind
meanwhile
and
then
he
would
probably
come
up
with
another
impossible
demonstration
listen
he
said
whispering
in
her
ear
if
you
two
are
thinking
of
something
crazy
like
private
law
at
least
let
me
know
so
i
can
help
you
i
wish
father
were
alive
he
added
helplessly
so
do
i
he
was
the
only
one
in
our
family
with
any
sense
thanks
just
the
same
snubnose
she
said
and
she
pressed
his
hand
for
a
little
while
he
solemnly
held
her
hand
then
suddenly
dropped
it
i
did
think
he
said
this
is
worse
than
ever
if
you
really
believe
that
demonstration
is
going
to
work
you
do
seem
a
bit
worried
about
the
fact
that
you
wo
see
him
for
five
years
and
another
thing
said
the
young
man
if
his
physics
are
right
you
will
be
getting
old
and
he
will
be
the
same
age
he
is
now
in
five
years
i
be
an
old
old
woman
said
the
girl
sarcastically
and
you
be
an
old
old
man
and
we
sit
in
the
square
in
the
sun
and
talk
about
all
this
but
right
now
let
quit
talking
about
it
because
i
see
that
little
ahead
of
us
there
is
pricking
up
her
ears
but
she
herself
said
one
more
thing
if
you
so
anxious
to
worry
worry
about
the
principles
that
the
one
thing
that
is
bothering
me
then
they
smiled
at
each
other
and
were
silent
and
soon
a
wave
of
silence
washed
back
to
them
as
the
head
of
the
procession
turned
from
the
street
of
the
scientists
lined
with
its
oaks
to
the
open
shining
avenue
of
the
sun
where
no
person
might
speak
without
sacrilege
the
godsman
raised
his
hands
to
the
sun
and
everyone
else
entering
the
avenue
bowed
his
head
they
marched
in
silence
formally
humbly
until
at
the
street
of
ward
arms
clashed
in
salute
here
were
the
apartments
of
the
honorary
militia
the
warders
the
street
ran
between
their
dwellings
and
the
city
wall
the
warders
had
formed
their
squads
on
the
flat
roofs
and
they
were
happily
juggling
their
polished
weapons
more
effective
for
their
sparkle
and
clang
wiseacres
said
than
for
repelling
the
bowmen
during
the
previous
generation
mobile
units
of
the
public
law
police
had
taken
over
the
job
of
fighting
the
intermittent
wars
with
the
bowmen
for
that
reason
as
snubnose
knew
well
the
police
would
be
especially
vindictive
in
tracking
down
and
proudwalk
if
they
attempted
a
private
law
marriage
the
public
law
police
hated
anyone
with
genes
of
the
bowmen
in
his
chromosomes
the
last
squad
of
warders
saluted
and
the
scientists
trooped
onto
the
field
of
proof
it
was
called
in
one
of
the
songs
of
the
guild
of
scientists
verdant
place
where
truth
doth
reign
but
the
place
was
only
spottily
verdant
because
the
apprentice
biologists
who
were
supposed
to
keep
the
field
grassed
were
not
conscientious
they
spent
most
of
their
time
in
the
ready
hall
gossiping
with
prospective
candidates
dust
rose
from
large
bare
patches
beneath
the
shoes
of
the
scientists
at
a
sign
from
the
grandmaster
the
guildfolk
spread
in
a
single
circle
the
grandmaster
took
his
position
at
the
center
of
the
circle
with
the
candidate
the
candidate
master
the
kingsman
and
the
godsman
the
bowman
strain
in
was
conspicuous
as
he
stood
beside
the
others
it
was
marked
by
his
height
and
by
the
unmistakable
way
the
bones
of
his
face
shaped
themselves
a
romantic
girl
could
look
at
him
and
think
of
a
noble
primitive
and
fall
in
love
snubnose
reflected
a
dame
could
look
at
him
and
think
of
the
public
slaves
bowmen
captured
in
battle
sweating
and
stinking
in
the
building
gangs
what
do
i
think
snubnose
asked
himself
he
shrugged
is
my
friend
he
turned
to
say
something
to
his
sister
and
he
saw
that
she
had
left
him
while
the
circle
had
been
forming
she
had
moved
a
quarter
way
around
now
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
lover
snubnose
felt
vaguely
hurt
he
said
to
himself
childishly
they
up
to
something
and
they
treating
me
like
a
little
boy
again
time
said
the
grandmaster
and
what
was
time
snubnose
the
physicist
asked
himself
that
question
in
his
physics
it
was
the
denominator
of
velocity
squared
the
denominator
of
acceleration
in
old
texts
incomplete
variously
translated
little
understood
it
was
called
a
dimension
when
multiplied
by
an
imaginary
number
but
imaginary
numbers
had
no
place
in
physics
so
it
had
been
decided
in
drc
at
the
historic
conference
of
scientists
kingsmen
and
godsmen
imaginary
numbers
with
some
other
concepts
had
been
declared
metaphysics
and
had
been
turned
over
to
the
godsmen
just
as
neuroses
because
of
their
traditional
origin
in
sexual
impulses
had
been
taken
away
from
the
psychologists
and
assigned
to
the
kingsmen
snubnose
remembered
how
crookback
had
catechized
the
pair
of
them
and
him
on
the
principles
how
did
that
one
go
science
appertains
only
to
matter
itself
not
to
the
mysteries
of
matter
or
the
desires
of
matter
the
mysteries
of
matter
belong
to
the
gods
and
the
desires
of
matter
belong
to
the
king
or
something
like
that
he
had
been
quick
with
his
lessons
like
his
friend
had
scoffed
at
the
principles
when
alone
with
him
but
had
learned
them
by
heart
after
a
couple
of
offhand
readings
snubnose
would
sweat
and
sweat
and
think
he
had
them
but
when
the
time
came
to
recite
the
words
would
fly
out
the
window
into
the
air
old
crookback
had
got
so
disgusted
with
him
once
that
he
had
put
him
on
bread
and
water
and
then
had
sneaked
out
over
the
city
wall
and
had
caught
a
rabbit
in
a
homemade
trap
and
had
talked
one
of
the
women
of
the
settled
bowmen
into
cooking
it
for
them
gods
that
had
tasted
good
at
midnight
the
circle
of
scientists
was
getting
noisy
snubnose
nearest
neighbors
were
loudly
rehashing
the
latest
private
law
marriage
snubnose
wondered
suddenly
why
did
the
demonstration
start
the
grandmaster
had
said
time
was
there
trouble
in
the
center
of
the
field
while
stood
apart
the
dignitaries
were
carrying
on
one
of
those
exasperating
public
wrangles
obvious
but
inaudible
the
godsman
was
doing
most
of
the
talking
waving
a
plump
arm
the
grandmaster
looked
unhappy
the
kingsman
looked
important
and
crookback
looked
polite
the
godsman
was
so
excited
he
scratched
his
bare
buttock
he
caught
himself
and
blushed
a
total
affair
for
a
godsman
and
during
his
embarrassment
crookback
began
to
talk
the
godsman
kept
shaking
his
head
and
interrupting
but
crookback
went
on
talking
and
finally
the
godsman
seemed
to
give
a
reluctant
consent
the
grandmaster
raised
his
hand
high
with
the
fingers
spread
and
a
girl
apprentice
burst
from
the
door
of
the
ready
hall
she
ran
across
the
field
and
two
scientists
smilingly
moved
aside
to
let
her
through
she
stood
panting
before
the
grandmaster
he
handed
her
the
symbolic
messenger
key
and
spoke
to
her
briefly
briefly
for
the
grandmaster
she
was
off
on
the
run
snubnose
did
know
what
was
happening
but
it
looked
as
if
the
godsman
had
made
some
kind
of
a
concession
he
was
sure
that
must
be
for
the
good
and
felt
relieved
until
the
grandmaster
leaning
on
his
copper
staff
addressed
the
guildfolk
the
grandmaster
began
the
holy
one
submitted
an
objection
concerning
a
possible
violation
of
the
principles
and
proposed
to
forbid
the
demonstration
by
the
candidate
if
that
stood
would
probably
be
tried
for
sacrilege
in
godsmen
castle
yet
the
godsman
had
seemed
to
give
ground
needless
to
say
both
the
distinguished
master
of
the
candidate
and
i
myself
speaking
individually
for
ourselves
and
in
my
own
case
especially
speaking
for
the
guild
of
scientists
as
a
body
assured
the
holy
one
of
our
reverent
adherence
to
the
principles
and
he
was
interrupted
by
the
angry
voice
of
the
godsman
get
on
the
guildfolk
buzzed
as
often
as
they
might
have
liked
to
tell
their
grandmaster
to
get
on
this
was
an
insult
to
the
guild
but
they
were
quickly
silent
for
it
was
an
insult
they
would
have
to
swallow
at
least
in
public
the
grandmaster
swallowed
it
too
visibly
gulping
and
he
said
mildly
the
holy
one
has
generously
agreed
to
submit
the
issue
to
the
high
arbiter
of
the
guild
of
lawyers
and
the
high
arbiter
has
been
sent
for
it
was
the
last
thing
said
that
alarmed
snubnose
and
he
looked
at
his
sister
and
saw
that
for
the
first
time
her
face
was
tight
with
unease
the
high
arbiter
was
an
old
friend
of
their
mother
which
was
not
likely
to
make
him
a
friend
of
theirs
today
he
moved
in
the
same
snobbish
society
as
their
mother
and
had
many
times
clucked
with
her
about
proudwalk
infatuation
for
that
lowborn
young
man
snubnose
would
have
liked
to
leave
his
place
in
the
circle
of
scientists
and
join
proudwalk
but
it
was
against
acknowledged
custom
to
change
position
once
the
circle
was
formed
everyone
now
was
shuffling
uncomfortably
in
the
hot
sun
except
the
godsman
who
was
exposed
to
the
cooling
air
and
had
the
godsmen
secret
of
escaping
sunburn
and
who
looked
as
uncomfortable
as
anybody
else
but
did
not
shuffle
he
stood
still
and
straight
while
sweat
ran
down
his
face
into
the
tight
black
neckband
of
an
apprentice
once
he
seemed
to
look
at
snubnose
and
wink
or
perhaps
he
was
only
winking
the
sweat
away
an
elephant
moved
slowly
down
the
street
of
ward
and
onto
the
field
of
proof
it
was
a
ponderous
metal
ovoid
bearing
on
its
roof
a
velvet
pavilion
with
the
curtains
drawn
the
circle
of
scientists
parted
and
opened
and
the
elephant
with
much
grinding
came
to
a
stop
a
few
feet
from
the
group
in
the
center
of
the
field
the
driver
an
apprentice
lawyer
climbed
from
his
hole
and
parted
the
curtains
of
the
pavilion
the
high
arbiter
looked
out
at
the
world
with
a
sour
expression
he
did
not
descend
i
will
hear
the
holy
one
first
he
said
from
his
roost
the
godsman
raised
his
hands
to
the
sun
and
spoke
wise
one
the
candidate
and
his
master
abetted
by
the
grandmaster
of
the
guild
of
scientists
are
shamelessly
defying
the
principles
the
candidate
is
preparing
to
demonstrate
the
accelerated
movement
of
matter
into
the
future
that
is
a
mystery
of
matter
only
the
gods
can
know
the
path
that
things
take
from
the
dimming
past
to
the
dark
future
scientists
must
confine
themselves
to
their
arts
and
not
try
to
steal
the
mysteries
belonging
to
the
gods
the
gods
grant
knowledge
of
mysteries
to
godsmen
who
have
humbly
supplicated
not
to
thieves
let
the
scientists
work
to
improve
the
that
spin
through
the
night
seeking
out
the
encampments
of
the
bowmen
let
them
mix
better
fertilizers
to
sell
to
the
lords
of
the
west
let
them
keep
in
repair
the
ancient
elephants
for
the
honor
of
our
exalted
citizens
the
high
arbiter
looked
slightly
less
sour
and
he
nodded
shortly
i
will
hear
the
grandmaster
of
the
guild
of
scientists
he
said
the
grandmaster
lifted
his
head
wise
one
he
said
the
godsman
jibes
and
with
some
basis
generation
to
generation
the
spin
more
slowly
and
seek
less
surely
the
fertilizers
grow
leaner
the
ceremonial
elephants
are
fewer
and
worse
perhaps
the
godsmen
are
not
supplicating
hard
enough
for
solutions
to
mysteries
of
matter
solutions
which
would
enable
the
scientists
to
control
matter
in
the
impious
days
before
the
principles
matter
served
mystery
and
mystery
served
matter
and
by
some
inexplicable
mercy
of
the
gods
things
went
very
well
years
of
banality
years
of
caution
years
of
looking
to
his
retirement
offering
had
for
a
little
while
lost
their
hold
on
him
snubnose
was
silently
raging
what
a
place
he
thought
for
the
grandmaster
to
burst
out
with
that
kind
of
thing
true
scientists
sometimes
talked
that
way
in
the
guild
social
rooms
especially
after
drinking
illegal
grain
distillate
but
here
it
could
only
hurt
cause
snubnose
looked
at
his
friend
was
trying
to
suppress
a
jubilant
smile
surprised
snubnose
looked
at
his
sister
she
was
jumping
up
and
down
with
pleasure
as
he
had
seen
her
do
for
at
least
two
years
romantics
he
said
to
himself
the
high
arbiter
had
a
talent
for
looking
displeased
and
now
he
did
not
stint
i
note
the
grandmaster
improper
tone
he
said
stiffly
furthermore
his
remarks
are
irrelevant
to
the
issue
the
holy
one
says
that
the
demonstration
treats
of
a
mystery
of
matter
in
violation
of
the
principles
in
view
of
the
grandmaster
failure
to
refute
that
it
is
highly
probable
however
it
will
have
to
be
established
by
authority
and
precedent
unless
the
demonstration
involves
an
idea
specifically
forbidden
which
would
be
conclusive
i
will
hear
the
holy
one
there
is
indeed
a
forbidden
idea
it
is
known
from
tradition
and
old
texts
that
the
mathematic
of
accelerated
movement
through
time
involves
imaginary
numbers
at
the
conference
of
drc
it
was
confirmed
that
imaginary
numbers
are
a
metaphysical
concept
forbidden
to
scientists
i
will
hear
the
candidate
master
a
light
cloud
was
filtering
the
sunlight
and
the
old
man
seemed
cool
and
calm
he
took
a
step
to
a
little
mound
of
good
grass
as
if
he
were
climbing
to
a
rostrum
wise
one
neither
the
holy
one
nor
our
own
grandmaster
both
devoted
patriots
with
their
minds
on
the
welfare
of
the
city
thought
to
bring
one
very
important
fact
to
your
attention
my
demonstration
is
not
an
original
experiment
it
is
a
reconstructed
experiment
by
acknowledged
custom
reconstructed
experiments
are
permitted
regardless
of
mysteries
and
ideas
so
long
as
the
experimenter
does
not
comprehend
any
impious
theory
but
merely
follows
the
practical
directions
of
old
texts
i
declare
that
my
apprentice
is
ignorant
of
the
theory
of
his
demonstration
and
who
is
in
a
better
position
to
know
than
his
master
snubnose
rejoiced
he
was
ready
to
forgive
even
the
bread
and
water
in
a
few
sentences
crookback
had
excused
the
grandmaster
rashness
had
made
good
the
grandmaster
oversight
and
had
set
forth
a
strong
case
for
i
will
hear
the
holy
one
let
him
prove
that
the
godsman
shouted
i
will
hear
the
candidate
master
i
regret
that
i
can
not
prove
it
absolutely
negatives
are
difficult
of
proof
i
suggest
that
the
candidate
swear
to
his
ignorance
by
the
god
you
should
know
that
apprentices
are
not
eligible
to
take
oaths
the
high
arbiter
said
impatiently
dropping
the
formal
manner
as
if
in
a
hurry
to
finish
the
proceedings
and
finish
encouraged
the
godsman
cried
let
crookback
swear
to
it
he
was
willing
to
declare
it
will
you
the
high
arbiter
asked
crookback
though
i
am
sure
of
the
truth
my
reverence
for
the
god
is
too
great
to
permit
me
to
swear
to
the
contents
of
another
mind
that
and
not
wanting
to
be
tried
for
false
swearing
snubnose
muttered
he
admired
his
old
master
a
lot
but
i
will
swear
by
the
god
that
i
myself
am
ignorant
of
the
theory
what
good
is
that
the
godsman
demanded
cleverly
the
master
stood
in
respectful
silence
there
was
an
awkward
pause
awkward
for
the
godsman
and
the
high
arbiter
and
then
the
high
arbiter
collected
himself
and
said
the
question
may
be
answered
i
will
hear
the
candidate
master
i
am
shocked
and
saddened
said
crookback
that
the
holy
one
believes
that
apprentices
still
wearing
their
neckbands
excel
in
wisdom
the
masters
of
the
guilds
the
high
arbiter
driver
who
had
been
squatting
meekly
by
the
elephant
suddenly
let
loose
a
screaming
laugh
which
he
cut
off
just
as
suddenly
with
a
scared
catch
of
breath
i
will
hear
the
oath
the
high
arbiter
said
crookback
swore
by
the
god
while
the
godsman
glowered
the
high
arbiter
said
the
demonstration
may
proceed
my
apprentices
will
present
my
bills
tomorrow
including
commutation
of
fees
for
twenty
journeyman
lawyers
since
you
did
not
place
the
issue
in
courts
everybody
winced
and
the
elephant
rumbled
away
the
doors
of
the
ready
hall
opened
and
the
whole
body
of
apprentice
scientists
marched
on
the
field
they
carried
sections
of
steel
sheet
lengths
of
magnesium
tubing
and
parts
of
machines
unfamiliar
to
the
guildfolk
under
direction
they
began
to
assemble
the
equipment
and
to
enclose
it
in
a
small
building
had
planned
well
they
put
the
components
together
quickly
and
marched
from
the
field
they
had
erected
a
cubical
chamber
of
bright
steel
with
an
opening
near
the
ground
just
big
enough
for
a
person
not
too
fat
a
person
to
crawl
through
above
the
opening
a
closing
panel
was
suspended
in
grooves
the
grandmaster
and
the
godsman
and
the
kingsman
inspected
the
setup
with
the
peculiar
ignorant
attention
of
high
officials
each
walked
around
the
cube
once
and
rapped
it
with
his
fingers
here
and
there
each
solemnly
stooped
to
the
ground
and
put
his
head
in
the
opening
although
it
was
dark
inside
and
nothing
was
visible
the
plump
godsman
made
a
move
as
if
to
crawl
in
then
backed
away
the
kingsman
brushed
dust
from
his
cloak
and
the
inspection
seemed
to
be
over
the
three
officials
and
crookback
withdrew
to
the
circle
of
scientists
and
stood
just
within
it
a
little
to
the
left
of
snubnose
took
hold
of
the
door
panel
the
only
projection
on
the
smoothness
of
the
cube
and
scrambled
to
the
roof
where
he
could
be
seen
by
the
whole
circle
now
was
really
enjoying
himself
snubnose
thought
and
proudwalk
was
enjoying
with
her
big
eyes
elder
ones
whether
my
experiment
succeeds
or
fails
the
outcome
will
be
i
make
no
qualifications
and
prepare
no
excuses
i
will
now
go
ahead
with
the
demonstration
snubnose
said
to
himself
it
a
better
performance
than
the
high
arbiter
gave
on
his
elephant
he
would
have
liked
to
yell
some
words
of
encouragement
before
i
start
added
as
required
by
the
laws
of
the
guild
i
ask
are
there
any
among
you
who
wish
to
inspect
my
apparatus
it
was
no
longer
considered
good
manners
to
accept
that
invitation
but
a
journeyman
physicist
named
stepped
forward
he
walked
very
carefully
and
snubnose
wondered
how
much
grain
distillate
he
had
drunk
that
morning
before
he
reached
the
steel
chamber
yelled
to
the
candidate
tell
me
how
to
start
it
i
do
like
our
times
anyway
it
not
going
very
far
said
easily
it
not
going
anywhere
boy
roared
everybody
knows
that
i
do
know
why
we
wasted
so
much
time
today
you
better
not
move
any
dials
there
are
a
couple
of
lamps
inside
if
you
want
to
look
around
crawled
through
the
opening
five
minutes
later
he
crawled
out
his
hair
in
his
eyes
i
ca
make
anything
of
it
he
said
to
everybody
in
general
and
he
resumed
his
place
in
the
circle
now
elder
ones
does
anyone
else
wish
to
inspect
the
apparatus
i
do
it
was
proudwalk
she
walked
on
grass
and
over
the
patches
of
shifting
dust
walked
with
the
graceful
slightly
affected
manner
that
had
given
her
the
name
there
was
the
pride
in
her
walk
and
there
was
sexuality
leaped
to
the
ground
to
meet
her
he
bowed
as
if
they
were
at
the
king
councillor
ball
and
he
were
asking
her
for
the
dance
proudwalk
touched
her
palms
together
in
the
stylized
gesture
of
acceptance
immediately
she
slipped
through
the
entrance
stooped
and
quickly
followed
her
the
door
panel
dropped
down
its
grooves
sealing
the
chamber
the
scientists
chattered
the
godsman
shouted
the
kingsman
raised
his
voice
what
going
on
grandmaster
a
reconstructed
demonstration
attempting
the
accelerated
movement
of
matter
through
time
to
the
relatively
near
future
by
an
apprentice
who
having
completed
the
requisite
service
has
been
admitted
to
candidature
for
the
rank
of
journeyman
physicist
the
grandmaster
took
a
breath
ask
the
candidate
master
the
godsman
said
with
the
calmness
now
of
more
intense
anger
you
heard
him
trick
the
high
arbiter
into
ruling
that
a
mystery
of
matter
is
not
a
mystery
and
a
forbidden
idea
is
not
forbidden
maybe
he
can
convince
you
that
a
desire
of
matter
is
not
a
desire
of
matter
crookback
spoke
up
at
once
it
would
seem
an
unlikely
place
to
give
way
to
desire
but
i
am
an
old
bachelor
as
ignorant
of
the
desires
of
matter
as
of
its
mysteries
however
young
men
and
women
frequently
work
together
on
scientific
experiments
not
in
windowless
boxes
said
the
kingsman
and
who
gave
her
leave
to
help
the
candidate
there
is
something
odd
about
this
whole
demonstration
and
i
going
to
find
out
what
it
is
the
kingsman
strode
to
the
little
building
the
sun
had
returned
in
full
brightness
and
the
walls
were
glistening
the
kingsman
glistened
too
the
smooth
fabric
of
his
cloak
his
silver
ornaments
his
mace
of
massy
silver
sharply
he
rapped
with
his
mace
on
the
closed
door
there
was
afterwards
silence
he
rapped
again
there
was
again
silence
the
kingsman
lost
his
temper
he
brought
back
his
mace
and
swung
it
fiercely
toward
the
