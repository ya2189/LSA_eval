review
of
the

in
household
of
bouverie
by
warfield
is
a
wonderful
book
i
have
read
it
twice
the
second
time
more
carefully
than
the
first
and
i
use
the
term
because
it
best
expresses
the
feeling
uppermost
in
my
mind
both
while
reading
and
thinking
it
over
as
a
piece
of
imaginative
writing
i
have
seen
nothing
to
equal
it
since
the
days
of
edgar
poe
and
i
doubt
whether
he
could
have
sustained
himself
and
the
readers
through
a
book
half
the
size
of
the
of
bouverie
i
have
literally
hurried
through
it
by
my
intense
sympathy
my
devouring
curiosity
it
was
more
than
interest

read
everywhere
between
the
courses

of
sea

by
warfield
author
of
the
household
of
bouverie
chapter
i
it
was
a
calm
and
hazy
morning
of
southern
summer
that
on
which
i
turned
my
face
seaward
from
the
keep
of
beauseincourt
never
i
knew
to
see
its
walls
again
save
through
the
mirage
of
memory
there
is
an
awe
almost
as
solemn
to
me
in
a
consciousness
like
this
as
that
which
attends
the
parting
and
my
straining
eye
takes
in
its
last
look
of
a
familiar
scene
as
it
might
do
the
face
of
friendship
the
refrain
of
poe
even
then
celebrated
poem
was
ringing
through
my
brain
on
that
sultry
august
day
i
remember
like
a
tolling
bell
as
i
looked
my
last
on
the
gloomy
abode
of
the
la
vignes
but
i
only
said
aloud
in
answer
to
the
sympathizing
glances
of
one
who
sat
before
me
the
gentle
and
quiet
marion
who
had
suddenly
determined
to
accompany
me
to
savannah
nerved
with
unwonted
impulse
madame
de
staÃ«l
was
right
when
she
said
that
was
the
saddest
and
most
expressive
word
in
the
english
tongue
so
harsh
to
her
ears
usually
i
think
she
called
it
the
sweetest
too
in
sound
but
to
me
it
is
simply
the
most
sorrowful
a
knell
of
doom
and
it
fills
my
soul
to
overflowing
for
never
more
shall
i
look
on
beauseincourt
you
can
not
tell
miss
harz
what
may
do
you
may
still
return
to
visit
us
in
our
retirement
you
and
captain
wentworth
urged
marion
gently
leaning
forward
as
she
spoke
to
take
my
hand
in
hers
the
fell
from
my
lips
ere
they
were
aware
that
is
a
grand
thought
one
that
i
saw
lately
in
a
western
poem
the
address
of
a
young
editor
of
kentucky
called
prentice
is
it
not
splendid
marion
very
awful
rather
she
responded
with
a
faint
shudder
time
the
let
us
say
instead
miss
miriam
time
the
why
marion
you
are
quite
poetic
quite
greek
that
is
a
sweet
and
tender
saying
of
yours
and
i
shall
garner
it
i
stand
reproved
my
child
all
honor
to
time
the
whether
he
builds
palaces
or
tombs
but
none
the
less
do
i
reverence
my
young
poet
for
that
stupendous
utterance
of
his
soul
i
shall
watch
the
flight
of
that
eaglet
of
the
west
with
interest
from
this
hour
may
he
aspire
not
if
he
is
a
jackson
democrat
broke
in
the
usually
gentle
alice
durand
fired
with
a
ready
defiance
of
all
heterodox
policy
common
if
not
peculiar
to
that
region
oh
but
he
is
not
he
is
a
good
whig
instead
a
clay
man
as
we
call
such
not
a
calhoun
man
though
i
suppose
so
i
would
not
give
a
snap
of
my
fingers
for
him
or
his
poetry
it
is
very
natural
for
you
miss
harz
in
a
somewhat
deprecating
tone
to
praise
your
partisans
i
would
not
have
you
neutral
if
i
could
it
is
so
contemptible
a
little
of
the
good
doctor
spirit
there
under
all
that
exterior
of
meekness
and
modesty
i
saw
at
a
glance
and
liked
her
none
the
less
for
it
if
truth
were
told
and
now
we
were
nearing
the
gate
with
its
pillars
on
one
of
which
that
from
which
the
marble
ball
had
rolled
to
hide
in
the
grass
beneath
perchance
until
the
end
of
all
i
had
seen
the
joyous
figure
of
walter
la
vigne
so
lightly
poised
on
the
occasion
of
my
last
exodus
from
beauseincourt
a
moment
pause
and
the
difficult
disused
bolts
that
had
once
exasperated
the
patience
of
colonel
la
vigne
were
drawn
asunder
and
the
clanking
gates
clashed
behind
us
as
we
emerged
from
the
shadowed
domain
into
the
glare
and
dust
of
the
here
major
favraud
accompanied
by
duganne
awaited
us
seated
in
state
in
his
lofty
stylish
swung
gig
with
his
tiny
tiger
behind
drawn
by
his
and
peerless
blooded
bays
castor
and
pollux
brothers
like
the
twins
of
leda
they
had
been
bred
in
the
region
of
kentucky
and
the
vicinity
of
ashland
and
were
worthy
of
their
ancient
pedigree
their
perfect
training
and
classic
names
the
last
bestowed
when
he
first
became
their
owner
by
major
favraud
who
with
a
touch
of
the
whip
or
a
turn
of
the
hand
controlled
them
to
subjection
fiery
coursers
although
they
were
durand
too
with
his
spacious
and
gig
accompanied
by
his
son
a
lad
of
sixteen
awaited
our
arrival
and
served
to
swell
the
cavalcade
that
wound
slowly
down
the
dusty
road
with
its
sandy
surface
and
substratum
a
few
young
gentlemen
on
horseback
completed
our
major
favraud
sat
holding
his
ribbons
gracefully
in
one
gauntleted
hand
while
he
uncovered
his
head
with
the
other
bowing
suavely
in
his
knightly
fashion
as
he
said
come
drive
with
me
miss
harz
for
a
while
and
let
the
young
folks
take
it
together
oh
no
major
favraud
you
must
excuse
me
indeed
i
feel
a
little
languid
this
morning
and
i
should
be
poor
company
besides
i
can
not
surrender
my
position
as
one
of
the
young
folks
yet
nay
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
something
very
earnest
you
shall
be
at
no
trouble
to
entertain
me
but
you
must
not
refuse
a
poor
sad
fellow
a
word
of
counsel
and
cheer
i
shall
think
hard
of
you
if
you
decline
to
let
me
drive
you
a
little
way
besides
the
freshness
of
the
morning
is
all
lost
on
you
there
now
set
marion
a
good
example
and
she
will
in
turn
enliven
me
later
so
adjured
i
consented
to
drive
to
the
house
with
major
favraud
and
duganne
glided
into
the
coach
in
my
stead
to
take
my
place
and
play
to
sylphy
who
as
usual
was
selected
as
on
this
occasion
to
take
kear
of
de
young
ladies
i
am
so
glad
i
have
you
all
to
myself
once
more
miss
harz
i
feel
now
that
we
are
fast
friends
again
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
while
i
could
speak
of
her
how
much
my
poor
wife
liked
you
the
time
will
come
when
i
must
not
not
you
know
but
for
circumstances
she
would
have
urged
you
to
become
our
guest
or
even
but
you
know
how
it
all
was
i
need
not
feign
any
longer
nor
apologize
either
it
must
have
been
that
she
saw
how
lovely
and
i
found
i
said
and
could
not
bear
to
be
outdone
in
consideration
nor
to
owe
a
debt
of
social
gratitude
she
knew
so
little
of
me
but
these
affinities
are
electric
sometimes
i
must
believe
yes
there
is
more
of
that
sort
of
thing
on
earth
perhaps
is
dreamed
of
in
our
philosophy
antagonism
and
attraction
are
always
going
on
among
us
unconsciously
i
am
inclined
to
believe
so
from
my
own
experience
i
replied
vaguely
thinking
heaven
knows
of
any
thing
at
the
moment
rather
than
of
him
who
sat
beside
me
your
mind
is
on
wentworth
i
perceive
he
said
softly
after
a
short
pause
now
give
up
your
dream
for
a
little
while
and
listen
to
this
sober
reality
sober
at
least
he
added
with
a
light
laugh
talking
of
magnetism
do
you
know
miss
harz
i
think
you
are
the
most
universally
magnetic
woman
i
ever
saw
all
the
men
fall
in
love
with
you
and
the
women
do
hate
you
for
it
either
how
perfectly
the
last
assertion
disproves
the
first
i
replied
but
i
retract
i
will
not
even
for
the
sake
of
a
syllogism
abuse
my
own
sex
women
are
never
envious
except
when
men
make
them
so
by
casting
down
among
them
the
golden
apple
of
admiration
i
know
one
man
at
least
who
never
foments
discord
in
this
way
wentworth
from
the
beginning
had
eyes
and
ears
for
no
one
but
yourself
yet
i
never
dreamed
the
drama
would
be
enacted
so
speedily
i
own
i
was
as
much
in
the
dark
as
anybody
i
could
not
reply
to
this
as
in
happier
moments
i
might
have
done
but
said
digressively
while
i
think
of
it
i
must
put
down
on
my
tablet
the
order
of
vernon
he
wants
poems
if
for
sale
in
savannah
he
has
been
permeating
his
brain
with
the
of
life
that
have
come
out
singly
in
the
until
he
craves
every
thing
that
pure
and
noble
mind
has
thrown
forth
in
the
shape
of
a
song
and
i
scribbled
in
my
for
a
moment
while
major
favraud
mused
longfellow
he
said
at
last
phoebus
what
a
name
adding
affectedly
yet
it
seems
to
me
on
reflection
i
heard
it
before
he
is
a
yankee
of
course
now
do
you
earnestly
believe
a
native
of
new
england
by
descent
a
legitimate
you
know
be
any
thing
better
than
a
in
the
poetical
line
have
we
not
proof
to
the
contrary
major
favraud
what
proof
metre
and
rhyme
i
grant
you
long
and
short
but
show
me
the
afflatus
they
make
verse
with
a
penknife
like
their
wooden
nutmegs
they
are
perfect
chinese
for
ingenuity
and
imitation
and
the
resemblance
to
the
real
is
very
perfect
externally
but
when
it
comes
to
grating
the
nut
for
negus
we
miss
the
aroma
do
you
pretend
that
bryant
is
not
a
poet
in
the
grain
and
that
the
wondrous
boy
willis
was
not
also
the
manner
born
read
or
are
you
acquainted
with
it
already
i
hardly
think
you
can
be
read
those
scriptural
poems
a
very
smooth
the
first
no
more
there
is
not
a
in
the
whole
grind
as
to
willie
he
failed
egregiously
when
he
attempted
to
refined
gold
and
paint
the
lily
as
he
did
in
his
poems
he
can
spin
a
yarn
pretty
well
and
coin
a
new
word
for
a
amusingly
but
save
me
from
the
of
his
poetry
this
is
surprising
you
upset
all
precedent
i
really
wish
you
had
not
said
these
things
i
now
begin
to
see
the
truth
of
what
my
told
me
long
ago
that
association
corrupts
good
manners
or
i
will
vary
it
and
substitute
i
must
eschew
your
society
in
a
literary
way
i
must
indeed
major
favraud
now
comes
along
this
strolling
longfellow
minstrel
he
continued
ignoring
or
not
hearing
my
remark
with
dreary
to
cap
the
climax
heavens
what
a
nasal
twang
the
whole
thing
has
to
me
not
an
original
or
cheerful
note
hundred
is
joyful
in
comparison
you
shall
not
say
that
i
interrupted
you
shall
not
dare
to
say
that
in
my
presence
it
is
sheer
slander
that
you
have
caught
up
from
some
malignant
british
review
and
like
all
other
serpents
you
are
venomous
in
proportion
to
your
blindness
i
am
vexed
with
you
that
you
will
not
see
with
the
clear
discerning
eyes
god
gave
you
originally
but
i
do
see
with
them
and
very
discerningly
notwithstanding
your
comparison
now
there
is
that
in
armor
his
last
effusion
i
believe
that
you
are
all
making
such
a
work
over
thing
enough
i
grant
you
ingenious
rhyme
and
all
that
but
i
know
where
the
framework
came
from
old
drayton
furnished
that
in
his
of
agincourt
then
in
a
clear
sonorous
voice
he
gave
some
specimens
of
each
so
as
to
point
the
resemblance
real
or
imaginary
you
are
content
with
mere
externs
in
finding
your
similitudes
major
favraud
in
power
of
thought
beauty
of
expression
what
comparison
is
there
drayton
verse
is
poor
and
vapid
even
mean
beside
longfellow
i
grant
you
that
i
have
never
for
one
moment
disputed
the
ability
of
those
yankees
their
manufacturing
talents
are
above
all
praise
but
when
it
comes
to
the
as
an
old
german
teacher
of
mine
used
to
say
our
simple
southern
poets
leave
them
all
behind
them
all
hollow
would
be
their
own
expression
you
gee
miss
harz
that
cavalier
blood
of
ours
that
inspired
the
old
english
bards
tell
in
spite
of
circumstances
but
genius
is
of
no
rank
no
blood
no
clime
what
court
poet
of
his
day
major
favraud
compared
with
robert
burns
for
feeling
fire
and
pathos
who
ever
sung
such
siren
strains
as
moore
a
simple
irishman
of
low
degree
no
cavalier
blood
there
i
fancy
what
power
what
beauty
in
the
poems
of
walter
scott
byron
was
a
poet
in
spite
of
his
condition
not
because
of
it
hear
barry
cornwall
how
he
stirs
the
blood
i
what
trumpet
like
to
campbell
i
what
mortal
voice
like
to
shelley
the
hybrid
angel
what
full
orchestra
surpassed
coleridge
for
harmony
and
brilliancy
of
effect
who
paints
panoramas
like
southey
who
charms
like
wordsworth
yet
these
were
men
of
medium
condition
all
i
hate
the
conceits
of
cowley
waller
sir
john
suckling
carew
and
the
like
all
of
your
cavalier
type
i
believe
a
set
of
hollow
pretenders
mostly
all
this
is
overwhelming
i
grant
bowing
deferentially
but
i
return
to
my
first
idea
that
puritan
blood
was
not
exactly
fit
to
engender
genius
and
that
in
the
rich
careless
southern
nature
there
lurks
a
vein
of
undeveloped
song
that
shall
yet
exonerate
america
from
the
charge
of
poverty
of
genius
brought
by
the
haughty
briton
yes
we
will
sing
yet
a
mightier
strain
than
has
ever
been
poured
since
the
time
of
shakespeare
and
in
that
good
time
coming
weave
a
grander
heroic
poem
than
any
since
the
days
of
homer
then
men
souls
shall
have
been
tried
in
the
furnace
of
affliction
and
greek
meets
not
greek
but
yankee
for
we
southerners
only
bide
our
time
and
he
cut
his
spirited
until
it
leaped
forward
suddenly
as
though
to
vent
his
excitement
and
setting
his
email
white
teeth
sternly
with
an
eye
like
a
burning
coal
looked
forward
into
space
his
whole
face
contracting
the
southern
lyre
has
been
but
lightly
swept
so
far
miss
harz
he
continued
a
moment
later
and
only
by
the
fingers
of
love
we
need
bellona
to
give
tone
to
our
orchestra
i
could
not
forbear
reciting
somewhat
derisively
the
old
couplet
the
trumpet
teat
the
drum
tremble
france
we
come
we
come
is
that
the
style
major
favraud
i
asked
i
remember
the
time
when
i
thought
these
two
lines
the
most
in
the
language
they
seem
very
bombastic
now
in
my
maturity
he
smiled
and
said
the
time
is
not
come
for
our
and
as
for
love
let
me
give
you
one
strain
of
pinckney
to
begin
with
and
without
waiting
for
permission
he
recited
the
beautiful
pledge
with
which
all
readers
are
now
familiar
little
known
then
however
beyond
the
limits
of
the
south
and
entirely
new
to
me
beginning
with
i
fill
this
cup
to
one
made
up
of
loveliness
alone
a
woman
of
her
gentle
sex
the
seeming
paragon
continuing
to
the
end
with
eloquence
and
spirit
now
that
is
poetry
miss
harz
the
real
afflatus
is
there
the
bead
on
the
wine
the
dew
on
the
rose
the
bloom
on
the
grape
nothing
wanting
that
constitutes
the
indefinable
divine
thing
called
genius
you
understand
my
idea
of
course
explanations
are
superfluous
i
assented
mutely
scarce
knowing
why
i
did
so
now
hear
another
and
the
woods
rang
with
his
clear
sonorous
accents
as
he
declaimed
a
little
too
scanningly
perhaps
too
much
like
an
enthusiastic
boy
love
lurks
upon
my
lady
lip
his
bow
is
figured
there
within
her
eyes
his
arrows
sleep
his
fetters
are
her
hair
i
call
that
nothing
but
a
bundle
of
conceits
major
favraud
mostly
of
the
days
of
charles
of
rochester
himself
interrupting
him
as
i
in
turn
was
interrupted
but
hear
further
and
he
proceeded
to
the
end
of
that
marvelous
ebullition
of
foam
and
fervor
such
as
celebrated
the
birth
of
aphrodite
herself
perchance
in
the
old
greek
time
and
which
despite
my
perverse
intentions
stirred
me
as
if
i
had
quaffed
a
draught
of
pink
champagne
is
it
not
indeed
all
de
hear
this
bit
of
melody
my
reader
sitting
in
supreme
judgment
and
perhaps
contempt
on
your
throne
apart
her
cheek
the
crimson
ray
by
changes
comes
and
goes
as
aurora
play
along
the
polar
snows
gay
as
the
that
sips
from
scented
flowers
the
dew
pure
as
the
snowy
swan
that
dips
its
wings
in
waters
blue
sweet
thoughts
are
mirrored
on
her
face
like
clouds
on
the
calm
sea
and
every
motion
is
a
grace
each
word
a
melody
yes
that
is
true
poetry
i
acknowledge
major
favraud
i
exclaimed
not
at
all
humbled
by
conviction
though
a
little
annoyed
at
the
pointed
manner
in
which
he
gave
looking
in
my
face
as
he
did
so
these
concluding
lines
say
from
what
fair
and
sunny
shore
fair
wanderer
dost
thou
rove
lest
what
i
only
should
adore
i
heedless
think
to
love
the
character
of
pinckney
genius
i
rejoined
is
i
think
essentially
like
that
of
praed
the
last
literary
phase
with
me
for
i
am
geological
in
my
poetry
and
take
it
in
strata
but
i
am
more
generous
to
your
southern
bard
than
you
are
to
our
glorious
longfellow
i
do
call
that
imitation
but
coincidence
the
oneness
of
genius
i
do
not
even
insinuate
plagiarism
my
manner
cool
and
careless
steadied
his
own
you
are
right
our
incapable
of
any
thing
of
the
sort
peace
be
to
his
ashes
with
all
his
nerve
and
he
died
of
melancholy
i
believe
as
good
an
end
as
any
however
and
certainly
highly
respectable
but
you
know
what
wordsworth
says
in
his
there
is
one
that
may
bemoan
his
kindred
laid
in
earth
the
household
hearts
that
were
his
own
it
is
the
man
of
mirth
he
sighed
as
he
concluded
his
quotation
sighed
and
slackened
the
pace
of
his
flying
steeds
but
give
me
something
of
praed
in
return
he
said
rallying
suddenly
is
there
not
a
pretty
little
thing
called
shall
i
woo
her
glancing
archly
and
somewhat
impertinently
at
me
i
thought
or
perhaps
what
would
simply
have
amused
me
in
another
man
and
mood
shocked
me
in
him
the
recent
widower
widowed
too
under
such
peculiar
and
awful
circumstances
i
did
not
reflect
sufficiently
perhaps
on
his
ignorance
of
many
of
these
last
how
i
deplored
his
levity
which
nothing
could
overcome
or
restrain
and
yet
beneath
which
i
even
then
believed
lay
depths
of
anguish
how
i
wished
that
influence
of
mine
could
prevail
to
induce
him
to
divide
his
dual
nature
to
throw
away
the
worser
part
of
it
and
live
the
purer
with
the
better
half
but
i
could
only
show
disapprobation
by
the
gravity
of
my
silence
so
you
will
not
give
me
shall
i
woo
her
miss
harz
a
little
embarrassed
i
perceived
by
my
manner
i
have
a
fancy
for
the
title
nevertheless
not
having
heard
any
more
and
should
be
glad
to
hear
the
whole
poem
but
you
are
prudish
i
fancy
no
there
is
nothing
in
that
poem
certainly
that
angels
might
not
hear
approvingly
but
it
would
sadden
you
major
favraud
i
will
take
the
chance
of
that
laughing
come
the
poem
if
you
care
to
please
your
driver
and
reward
his
care
see
how
skillfully
i
avoided
that
fallen
branch
suppose
i
were
to
be
spiteful
and
upset
you
against
this
stump
any
thing
was
preferable
to
his
levity
and
as
i
had
warned
him
of
the
possible
effect
of
the
poem
he
solicited
i
could
not
be
accused
of
want
of
consideration
in
reciting
it
besides
he
deserved
the
lesson
the
stern
lesson
that
it
taught
as
this
could
in
no
way
be
understood
by
such
of
my
readers
as
are
unacquainted
with
this
little
gem
i
venture
to
give
it
here
exquisite
passionate
utterance
that
it
is
though
little
known
to
fame
at
least
at
this
writing
shall
i
woo
her
i
will
stand
beside
her
when
she
sings
and
watch
her
fine
and
fairy
hand
flit
the
quivering
strings
but
shall
i
tell
her
i
have
heard
though
sweet
her
song
may
be
a
voice
where
every
whispered
word
more
than
song
to
shall
i
woo
her
i
will
gaze
in
sad
and
silent
trance
on
those
blue
eyes
whose
liquid
rays
look
love
in
every
glance
but
shall
i
tell
her
eyes
more
bright
though
bright
her
own
may
beam
will
fling
a
deeper
spell
me
in
my
i
hesitated
let
me
stop
here
major
favraud
i
counsel
you
i
interpolated
earnestly
but
he
only
rejoined
no
no
proceed
i
entreat
you
it
is
very
beautiful
very
touching
too
speaking
calmly
and
slacking
rein
so
that
the
grating
of
the
wheels
among
the
stems
of
the
scarlet
that
grew
in
immense
patches
on
our
road
might
not
disturb
his
sense
of
hearing
which
was
exquisitely
nice
and
fastidious
as
you
please
then
and
i
continued
the
recitation
shall
i
woo
her
i
will
try
the
charms
of
olden
time
and
swear
by
earth
and
sea
and
sky
and
rave
in
prose
and
rhyme
and
i
will
tell
her
when
i
bent
my
knee
in
other
years
i
was
not
half
so
i
could
not
speak
i
watched
him
narrowly
the
spell
was
working
now
the
poet
hand
was
sweeping
with
a
gust
of
power
that
harp
of
a
thousand
strings
the
wondrous
human
heart
and
i
again
pursued
in
suppressed
tones
of
emotion
the
pathetic
strain
that
he
had
evoked
with
an
idea
of
its
frivolity
alone
shall
i
woo
her
i
will
bow
before
the
holy
shrine
and
pray
the
prayer
and
vow
the
vow
and
press
her
lips
to
mine
and
i
will
tell
her
when
she
starts
from
passion
thrilling
kiss
that
to
many
hearts
is
dearer
far
than
bliss
it
was
reserved
for
the
concluding
verse
to
unnerve
him
completely
a
verse
which
i
rendered
with
all
the
pathos
of
which
i
was
capable
with
a
view
to
its
final
effect
i
confess
away
the
chords
are
mute
the
bond
is
rent
in
twain
you
wake
the
silent
lute
or
clasp
its
links
again
love
toil
i
know
is
little
cost
love
perjury
is
light
sin
but
souls
that
lose
what
i
have
lost
what
have
they
left
to
win
what
indeed
he
exclaimed
impetuously
tears
now
streaming
over
his
olive
cheeks
he
flung
the
reins
to
me
with
a
quick
convulsive
motion
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
groans
burst
from
his
murmuring
lips
and
the
great
deeps
of
sorrow
gave
up
their
secrets
i
was
sorry
to
have
so
stirred
him
to
the
depths
by
any
act
or
words
of
mine
and
yet
i
enjoyed
the
certainty
of
his
anguish
i
checked
the
horses
beneath
a
and
sat
quietly
waiting
for
the
flood
of
emotion
to
subside
as
for
him
to
take
the
initiative
i
had
no
word
to
say
no
consolation
to
offer
nay
after
consideration
rather
did
i
glory
in
his
grief
which
redeemed
his
nature
in
my
estimation
though
grieved
in
turn
to
have
afflicted
him
for
in
spite
of
all
his
faults
and
my
earlier
prejudices
i
loved
this
impulsive
southron
man
as
scott
has
it
right
brotherly
at
last
looking
up
grave
tearless
and
pale
and
resuming
his
reins
without
apology
for
having
surrendered
them
he
said
abruptly
all
is
so
vain
such
mockery
now
to
me
she
was
the
sole
reality
of
this
universe
to
my
heart
i
grapple
with
shadows
unceasingly
there
is
not
on
the
face
of
this
globe
a
more
desolate
wretch
you
understand
this
you
feel
for
me
you
do
not
deride
me
you
know
how
perfect
how
spiritual
she
was
you
loved
her
well
i
saw
it
in
your
eyes
your
manner
and
for
that
if
nothing
else
you
have
my
gratitude
so
few
appreciated
her
unearthly
purity
yet
was
it
not
strange
she
should
have
loved
a
man
so
gross
so
steeped
in
sensuous
thoughtless
enjoyment
so
remote
from
god
as
i
am
have
ever
been
but
the
song
speaks
for
me
waving
his
gauntleted
hand
better
than
i
can
speak
away
the
chords
are
mute
the
bond
is
rent
in
twain
i
shall
never
marry
again
never
miss
miriam
i
know
now
and
shall
know
evermore
in
all
its
fullness
and
weariness
and
bitterness
the
meaning
of
that
terrible
word
alone
eternal
solitude
the
robinson
crusoe
of
society
a
sort
of
social
daniel
boone
thus
you
must
ever
consider
me
and
yet
just
think
of
it
miss
harz
oh
but
you
will
not
always
feel
so
there
may
come
a
time
of
reaction
i
hesitated
it
was
not
my
purpose
to
encourage
change
no
never
never
he
interrupted
passionately
do
even
suggest
it
do
and
check
me
sternly
if
ever
i
forget
my
grief
again
in
frivolity
of
any
sort
in
your
presence
you
are
a
noble
sweet
woman
with
breadth
enough
of
character
to
make
allowances
for
the
shortcomings
of
a
poor
miserable
man
like
me
trying
to
cheat
himself
back
into
gayety
and
the
interests
of
life
i
have
sisters
but
they
are
not
like
you
i
wish
to
heaven
they
were
there
is
not
a
woman
in
the
world
on
whom
i
have
any
claims
on
whose
shoulder
i
can
lean
my
head
and
take
a
hearty
cry
and
what
are
men
at
such
a
season
mocking
fiends
usually
the
best
of
them
i
shall
go
abroad
miss
harz
i
am
no
anchorite
you
will
hear
of
me
as
a
gay
man
of
the
world
perhaps
but
as
to
being
happy
that
can
never
be
again
the
bubble
of
life
has
burst
and
my
existence
falls
flat
to
the
earth
victor
favraud
that
airy
nothing
is
scarcely
a
habitation
and
a
name
now
let
him
make
a
name
then
i
urged
with
military
talents
like
yours
major
favraud
the
road
to
distinction
will
soon
be
open
to
you
our
approaching
difficulties
with
france
oh
that
will
all
be
patched
up
or
has
been
by
this
time
van
buren
is
a
crafty
but
fox
something
of
an
epicurean
too
in
his
high
estate
what
grim
old
jackson
left
half
healed
he
will
complete
the
cure
of
ah
miss
harz
i
had
hoped
to
flesh
my
sword
in
a
nobler
cause
i
knew
what
he
meant
that
dream
of
nullification
was
still
uppermost
in
his
soul
dispersed
as
it
was
in
the
eyes
of
all
reasonable
men
i
shook
my
head
thank
god
all
that
is
over
i
said
gravely
fervently
and
my
prayer
to
him
is
that
he
may
vouchsafe
to
preserve
us
for
evermore
an
unbroken
people
may
he
help
israel
when
the
time
comes
he
murmured
low
for
come
it
will
miss
harz
as
surely
as
there
is
a
sun
in
the
heavens
may
i
be
there
to
see
as
john
gilpin
said
or
some
one
of
him
which
was
it
and
whipping
up
his
lagging
steeds
as
we
gained
the
open
road
we
emerged
swiftly
from
the
shadows
of
the
forest
between
nodding
cornfields
already
helmed
and
plumed
for
the
harvest
and
plantations
green
with
thrifty
with
their
bolls
promising
such
bounteous
yield
and
meadows
covered
with
the
tufted
bermuda
grass
with
its
verdure
we
sped
our
way
toward
lenoir
landing
this
peninsula
was
formed
by
the
junction
of
two
rivers
between
which
intervened
a
narrow
point
of
land
with
a
background
of
steep
hills
covered
with
a
growth
of
and
to
the
summit
here
was
a
ferry
with
its
boat
of
the
primitive
sort
flat
barge
by
negroes
and
capable
of
containing
at
one
time
many
bales
of
cotton
a
stagecoach
or
wagon
with
four
horses
besides
passengers
this
ferry
constituted
the
chief
source
of
revenue
of
madame
grambeau
an
old
french
lady
remarkable
in
many
ways
she
kept
the
hard
by
with
its
neat
picketed
inclosure
its
overhanging
trees
and
small
trim
parterre
gay
at
this
season
with
various
annual
flowers
scarce
worth
the
cultivation
one
would
think
in
that
land
of
gorgeous
perennial
bloom
but
queen
margarets
ragged
robins
variegated
balsams
and
tawny
marigolds
have
their
associations
doubtless
to
make
them
dear
and
valuable
to
the
foreign
heart
to
which
they
seem
essential
wherever
a
plot
of
ground
be
in
possession
mignonette
i
have
observed
is
a
special
passion
with
the
french
exile
recalling
doubtless
the
narrow
boxes
fitted
to
the
stone
of
certain
former
lofty
lodgings
across
the
sea
perhaps
situated
in
the
heart
of
some
great
city
and
overlooking
roofs
and
the
street
being
quite
out
of
the
question
in
such
a
view
distant
as
it
seems
from
them
as
the
sky
itself
though
in
an
opposite
direction
i
have
used
the
word
exile
advisedly
with
regard
to
madame
grambeau
and
not
figuratively
at
all
she
was
i
had
been
told
a
of
good
class
who
had
taken
part
in
the
early
revolution
but
who
when
the
triumphed
and
drenched
the
land
in
blood
in
the
second
phase
of
that
fearful
outburst
of
volcanic
feeling
had
fled
before
the
whirlwind
with
her
child
and
husband
to
embark
for
america
at
the
point
of
embarcation
like
evangeline
the
husband
and
wife
had
been
separated
accidentally
and
on
her
arrival
in
a
strange
land
she
found
herself
alone
and
penniless
with
her
son
scarce
six
years
old
her
husband
had
been
carried
to
a
southern
port
she
learned
by
the
merest
chance
and
disguising
herself
in
man
attire
and
leading
her
little
son
by
the
hand
she
set
forth
in
quest
of
him
carrying
with
her
a
violin
which
together
with
the
clothes
she
wore
had
been
found
in
the
trunk
of
monsieur
grambeau
brought
on
the
vessel
in
which
she
came
but
which
depository
she
had
been
obliged
to
abandon
when
setting
forth
on
her
pilgrimage
she
was
no
unskillful
performer
on
this
instrument
and
solely
by
such
aid
she
gained
her
food
and
lodging
to
the
interior
of
georgia
reaching
her
destination
after
a
long
and
painful
journey
and
delays
of
many
kinds
she
found
her
husband
living
in
a
on
the
border
of
talupa
river
a
hut
which
he
had
built
himself
and
earning
his
bread
by
ferrying
travellers
across
that
stream
yet
here
with
the
characteristic
contentment
of
her
people
under
all
circumstances
she
settled
down
quietly
to
aid
him
and
make
his
home
happy
bore
him
many
children
most
of
whom
were
dead
at
the
time
i
saw
her
as
those
living
were
separated
from
her
at
that
period
reared
and
educated
them
herself
toiled
for
and
with
them
late
and
early
strained
every
nerve
in
the
arduous
cause
of
duty
and
found
herself
in
extreme
old
age
widowed
and
alone
having
amassed
but
little
of
the
world
lucre
yet
cheerful
and
energetic
even
if
dependent
still
on
her
own
exertions
all
this
and
much
more
i
had
heard
before
i
saw
madame
grambeau
or
her
abode
a
picturesque
affair
in
itself
however
humble
consisting
originally
of
a
to
which
more
recently
white
frame
wings
had
been
attached
projecting
a
few
feet
in
front
of
the
primitive
building
and
connected
thereto
by
a
gallery
which
embraced
the
whole
front
of
the
along
which
ran
puncheon
steps
the
entire
length
of
the
grand
original
as
of
the
porch
itself
it
was
a
triumph
of
rural
art
over
this
portico
so
low
in
front
as
barely
to
admit
the
passage
of
a
tall
man
beneath
its
eaves
without
stooping
a
wild
multiflora
rose
then
in
full
flower
was
artistically
trained
so
as
to
present
a
series
of
arches
to
the
eye
as
the
wayfarer
approached
the
dwelling
no
tapestry
was
ever
half
so
lovely
the
path
which
led
from
the
little
white
gate
with
its
swinging
chain
and
ball
was
covered
with
and
shells
and
bordered
by
box
trimly
clipped
and
kept
low
and
the
two
broad
steps
that
led
to
the
porch
bore
evidence
of
recent
scouring
though
rough
and
unpainted
framed
in
one
of
those
pointed
natural
of
vivid
green
gemmed
with
red
roses
of
which
the
of
the
porch
formed
the
white
outlines
stood
the
most
aged
woman
i
have
ever
seen
at
a
first
glance
indeed
the
question
of
sex
would
have
arisen
and
been
found
difficult
to
decide
her
attire
seemed
that
of
a
friar
even
to
the
small
scalloped
cape
that
scantily
covered
her
shoulders
and
the
coarse
black
serge
of
which
her
strait
gown
was
composed
leaving
exposed
her
neatly
though
coarsely
clad
feet
with
their
stockings
and
shoes
confined
with
steel
buckles
and
elevated
on
heels
then
worn
by
men
alone
she
wore
a
white
habit
shirt
the
collar
bosom
and
wristbands
of
which
were
visible
but
no
cap
covered
her
silver
hair
which
was
cropped
in
the
neck
and
divided
at
one
side
in
true
manly
fashion
it
was
brushed
well
back
from
her
expansive
fair
and
unwrinkled
forehead
beneath
which
large
blue
eyes
looked
out
with
that
strange
solemnity
we
see
alone
in
the
orbs
of
young
thoughtful
children
or
the
very
old
scott
description
of
the
monk
of
melrose
abbey
occurred
to
me
as
i
gazed
on
this
calm
and
striking
figure
and
strangely
on
the
knight
looked
he
and
his
blue
eyes
gleamed
wild
and
wide
she
stood
watching
our
approach
leaning
with
both
hands
on
her
ebony
cane
above
which
she
stooped
slightly
her
aged
and
somewhat
severe
but
serene
face
fully
turned
toward
us
in
the
clear
light
of
morning
with
a
grave
majesty
of
aspect
above
her
head
in
its
wicker
cage
swung
the
gray
and
crimson
parrot
of
which
sylphy
had
spoken
and
to
which
it
may
be
remembered
she
had
so
irreverently
likened
her
master
on
one
occasion
bursting
forth
as
it
saw
us
coming
into
a
shrill
stereotyped
phrase
of
welcome
venu
that
was
irresistibly
ludicrous
and
irrelevant
tremble
france
we
come
we
come
said
major
favraud
there
your
quotation
well
applied
this
time
miss
harz
it
is
impressive
after
all
hush
she
will
hear
you
i
remonstrated
quite
awed
in
that
still
majestic
presence
for
now
we
stood
before
our
aged
hostess
who
with
a
cold
but
stately
politeness
after
major
favraud
salutation
and
introduction
waved
us
in
and
across
her
threshold
as
for
major
favraud
he
had
turned
to
leave
us
on
the
to
see
to
the
comfort
and
safety
of
his
horses
not
liking
perhaps
the
appearance
of
the
superannuated
ostler
who
lounged
near
the
stable
of
the
inn
if
such
might
be
called
this
rustic
retreat
without
sign
lodging
or
are
we
in
the
mansion
of
a
decayed
queen
or
the
of
a
wayside
innkeeper
i
questioned
low
of
marion
both
in
one
it
seems
to
me
was
the
reply
but
madame
grambeau
is
no
curiosity
no
novelty
to
me
i
have
stopped
here
so
frequently
i
ought
to
have
told
you
before
we
came
not
to
be
surprised
pausing
at
the
door
of
a
large
square
room
from
which
voices
proceeded
she
invited
us
with
a
singularly
graceful
though
formal
courtesy
to
enter
smiling
and
pointing
forward
silently
as
she
did
so
and
then
like
major
favraud
she
turned
and
abandoned
us
at
the
on
which
we
stood
riveted
for
a
moment
by
the
sound
of
a
vibrant
and
eager
voice
speaking
some
words
for
the
slave
is
the
of
the
south
said
the
voice
within
insignificant
in
himself
he
rears
a
giant
structure
which
will
yet
cause
the
wreck
of
the
ship
of
state
should
its
keel
grate
too
closely
on
that
adamantine
wall
said
louis
and
that
is
the
south
is
as
true
an
utterance
our
staple
our
patriarchal
institution
our
prosperity
are
one
and
indissoluble
and
the
sooner
the
issue
comes
the
better
for
the
nation
standing
with
his
hand
on
the
back
of
a
chair
near
the
of
the
large
low
apartment
in
close
conversation
with
two
other
gentlemen
was
the
speaker
of
these
remarkable
words
which
embraced
the
whole
genius
and
policy
of
the
south
as
it
then
existed
and
which
were
delivered
in
those
clear
and
perfectly
modulated
tones
that
bespeak
the
practised
orator
and
the
man
of
dominant
energies
i
felt
instinctively
that
i
stood
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
anointed
princes
of
the
earth
felt
it
and
was
thrilled
do
you
know
that
gentleman
marion
i
whispered
as
we
seated
ourselves
on
the
settle
or
rather
sofa
in
one
corner
of
the
room
gazing
admiringly
as
i
spoke
on
the
tall
slight
figure
with
its
air
of
power
and
poise
that
stood
at
some
distance
with
averted
face
no
i
have
no
idea
who
it
is
or
who
are
his
companions
either
she
replied
unless
hesitating
with
scrutiny
in
her
eyes
his
companions
i
do
not
care
to
question
of
them
but
that
man
himself
the
speaker
has
a
sovereign
presence
can
it
be
possible
the
entrance
of
major
favraud
interrupted
further
conjecture
for
at
the
sound
of
those
emphatic
boots
the
stranger
turned
and
for
one
moment
the
splendor
of
his
large
dark
eyes
in
their
iron
framing
met
my
own
then
passed
recognizingly
on
to
rest
on
the
face
of
major
favraud
and
advancing
with
extended
hands
made
more
cordial
by
his
voice
and
smile
he
greeted
him
familiarly
as
victor
major
favraud
stood
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
rushing
forward
flung
his
hat
to
the
floor
caught
the
hand
of
the
stranger
between
his
own
and
pressed
it
to
his
heart
to
his
lips
i
think
he
would
fain
have
lifted
it
falling
on
one
knee
perchance
at
the
same
time
in
a
knightly
fashion
of
that
modern
reticence
forbids
but
he
contented
himself
with
exclaiming
calhoun
best
of
friends
welcome
back
to
georgia
and
tears
started
to
his
eyes
and
choked
his
utterance
thus
was
my
conjecture
confirmed
i
never
felt
so
thrilled
so
elated
by
any
presence
there
was
a
momentary
pause
after
this
fervent
greeting
emotional
on
one
part
only
but
why
did
you
not
meet
me
at
milledgeville
asked
calhoun
most
of
my
friends
in
this
vicinity
sustained
me
there
i
have
been
discussing
the
great
question
again
favraud
and
i
should
have
been
glad
of
your
countenance
i
have
been
detained
at
home
of
late
by
a
cruel
necessity
was
the
faltering
reply
or
i
should
never
have
played
recreant
to
my
old
master
good
fortune
spoiled
me
a
fine
lawyer
in
your
case
victor
but
introduce
me
to
your
wife
remember
i
have
never
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
madame
favraud
advancing
as
he
spoke
toward
me
with
his
hand
on
major
favraud
shoulder
above
whom
he
towered
by
a
head
courteously
and
impulsively
miss
harz
miss
la
vigne
miss
durand
calhoun
said
major
favraud
pale
as
death
now
and
trembling
as
he
spoke
these
ladies
are
friends
of
mine
one
a
distant
relative
he
hesitated
within
the
last
six
weeks
i
have
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
my
wife
calhoun
you
understand
matters
better
now
all
conversation
was
cut
short
by
this
sudden
announcement
deeply
shocked
calhoun
led
major
favraud
aside
with
a
brief
apology
to
me
for
his
misapprehension
and
they
stood
together
talking
low
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
apartment
affording
me
thus
an
admirable
opportunity
for
observing
the
of
the
great
southern
leader
during
the
brief
space
of
time
accorded
by
the
change
of
for
with
his
friends
he
was
then
for
another
appointment
he
was
canvassing
the
state
with
a
view
to
a
final
rally
of
its
resources
preparatory
to
his
last
great
effort
to
scotch
the
serpent
of
the
north
which
finally
however
wound
its
insidious
folds
around
the
heart
of
brotherly
affection
stifling
it
as
the
snakes
of
fable
were
sent
to
do
the
baby
hercules
no
picture
of
calhoun
has
ever
done
him
justice
although
his
was
a
physiognomy
that
an
artist
could
scarcely
fail
to
make
an
extern
likeness
of
from
its
remarkable
characteristics
it
was
truly
an
face
condensed
powerful
in
every
nerve
muscle
and
lineament
and
fraught
beyond
almost
all
others
with
intellect
and
resolution
but
the
glory
and
power
of
that
glance
and
smile
no
painter
could
convey
those
attributes
of
man
which
more
fully
than
aught
else
betray
the
immortal
soul
just
as
i
beheld
him
that
day
bending
above
major
favraud
in
his
tender
dignity
and
solicitude
combined
soothing
and
condoling
with
him
i
could
not
doubt
from
the
expression
of
his
speaking
countenance
i
see
him
still
in
mental
vision
nor
can
i
wonder
more
at
the
depth
and
strength
of
enthusiasm
he
awakened
in
the
hearts
of
his
friends
it
belongs
not
to
every
great
man
to
excite
this
devotion
yet
where
it
blends
with
greatness
it
is
irresistible
mohammed
cyrus
alexander
darius
pericles
napoleon
were
thus
magnetically
gifted
i
recall
few
instances
of
others
so
distinguished
in
station
who
possessed
this
power
which
has
its
root
perhaps
after
all
in
the
great
of
mortality
the
yearning
for
exalted
sympathy
so
seldom
accorded
this
observation
of
mine
was
but
a
glimpse
at
best
for
the
winding
of
the
was
the
signal
for
calhoun
departure
and
i
never
saw
him
more
but
that
glimpse
alone
opened
to
my
eyes
a
mighty
volume
a
few
days
before
i
should
have
rejected
as
wearisome
the
details
to
which
i
listened
with
eagerness
now
and
which
i
even
sought
to
elicit
as
to
calhoun
his
mode
of
life
his
and
his
passion
for
those
heights
he
inhabited
and
which
no
doubt
contributed
to
train
his
character
to
energy
and
strengthen
his
to
endure
its
i
heard
with
pleasure
the
account
of
one
who
had
passed
much
of
his
youth
beneath
his
roof
and
who
however
enthusiastic
was
in
the
very
framing
of
his
nature
strictly
truthful
with
regard
to
the
mutual
devotion
of
the
master
and
slaves
the
invariable
courtesy
and
sweetness
of
his
deportment
to
his
own
family
his
justice
and
regard
for
the
feelings
of
his
lowest
dependant
his
simplicity
his
cheerfulness
a
grave
and
even
gloomy
man
in
public
life
he
is
all
life
and
interest
in
the
social
circle
said
major
favraud
his
range
of
thought
is
the
grandest
and
most
unlimited
his
powers
of
conversation
are
the
rarest
i
have
ever
met
with
yet
he
never
refused
on
any
occasion
to
answer
with
minuteness
the
inquiries
of
the
smallest
child
or
most
insignificant
dependant
he
not
been
alexander
he
must
have
been
parmenio
had
fortune
not
struck
out
for
him
the
path
of
a
statesman
he
would
have
made
the
most
impressive
and
perfect
of
teachers
as
it
was
without
the
slightest
approach
to
pedagogism
he
involuntarily
instructed
all
who
came
near
him
without
effort
or
weariness
on
either
side
does
he
love
music
poetry
i
asked
oh
yes
scottish
songs
and
classic
verse
especially
are
his
delights
he
has
no
affectation
his
tastes
are
all
his
own
his
opinions
all
genuine
he
is
indeed
a
man
of
very
varied
attainment
as
well
as
great
grasp
of
intellect
yet
as
you
see
he
likes
his
opposites
sometimes
miss
harz
and
he
laid
his
hand
proudly
on
his
own
manly
breast
talking
thus
in
that
large
low
parlor
with
its
chairs
in
primitive
frames
and
in
somewhat
strange
contrast
to
its
mahogany
tables
dark
with
time
and
walls
adorned
with
good
engravings
with
its
floor
freshly
scoured
and
sanded
while
a
simple
deal
stand
in
the
centre
bore
a
vase
filled
with
the
rarest
and
most
exquisite
i
had
ever
seen
from
the
gorgeous
amaryllis
and
hibiscus
of
these
regions
down
to
blossoms
of
fragile
delicacy
and
beauty
whose
very
names
i
knew
not
and
its
many
small
all
neatly
curtained
with
coarse
white
muslin
bordered
with
blue
time
passed
unconsciously
until
the
noonday
meal
was
announced
we
followed
the
mercury
of
the
establishment
a
little
yellow
boy
who
seemed
to
have
grown
prematurely
old
from
his
constant
companionship
probably
with
his
preceptor
and
mistress
into
a
long
low
apartment
in
the
rear
of
the
dwelling
where
a
table
was
spread
for
our
party
with
a
damask
cloth
and
napkins
decorated
china
and
that
proved
madame
grambeau
personal
superintendence
and
which
elicited
from
major
favraud
as
he
entered
a
long
low
whistle
of
approval
and
surprise
and
the
exclamation
heh
madame
you
are
overwhelming
us
with
your
magnificence
i
was
amused
with
the
response
sit
down
victor
favraud
and
eat
your
dinner
without
remarks
you
have
never
got
over
the
spoiling
you
received
when
you
lay
wounded
under
this
roof
i
shall
indulge
you
no
longer
shaking
her
long
forefinger
at
him
your
familiarity
needs
to
be
checked
her
manner
of
grave
and
kindly
irony
removed
all
impression
of
rebuke
from
this
speech
which
major
favraud
received
very
coolly
spoiled
child
that
he
really
was
rubbing
his
hands
as
he
took
the
foot
of
the
table
at
the
sight
of
the
before
him
from
which
a
savory
steam
ascended
to
his
epicurean
nostrils
he
said
notwithstanding
soup
and
too
ah
madame
i
see
why
you
absented
yourself
so
cruelly
this
morning
you
have
been
engaged
in
good
works
only
the
sauces
favraud
les
the
sauces
it
just
that
ude
is
a
mere
charlatan
in
comparison
turning
to
me
miss
harz
you
never
tasted
any
thing
before
like
madame
soup
and
sauces
i
wish
she
would
take
me
in
partnership
for
a
while
if
only
to
teach
me
the
recipes
that
will
otherwise
die
with
her
what
a
restaurant
we
two
could
keep
together
you
are
too
unsteady
favraud
for
my
your
mind
is
too
much
engrossed
by
the
bubbles
of
politics
you
would
spoil
all
my
materials
and
realize
the
old
proverb
that
devil
sends
cooks
but
go
to
work
like
a
good
fellow
and
carve
the
dish
before
you
by
that
time
the
soup
will
be
removed
i
have
a
fine
fish
however
in
reserve
let
me
announce
this
at
once
for
my
end
of
the
table
here
are
croquets
too
as
i
live
said
duganne
lifting
a
cover
before
him
and
peeping
in
then
returning
it
quietly
to
its
place
are
you
a
fairy
madame
much
more
like
a
witch
she
said
with
gayety
you
young
men
at
least
think
every
old
toothless
crone
like
me
ready
for
the
stake
you
know
not
when
they
make
such
steaks
said
durand
attacking
the
dish
with
its
savory
surroundings
before
him
ah
you
make
calembourgs
my
good
what
do
you
call
them
favraud
it
is
one
of
the
few
english
words
i
do
not
know
or
forget
i
believe
to
make
them
however
is
a
medical
peculiarity
puns
madame
puns
not
pills
do
forget
it
now
it
is
time
you
were
beginning
to
master
our
language
you
know
you
are
almost
grown
up
and
favraud
looked
at
her
saucily
a
language
which
madame
speaks
more
perfectly
than
any
foreigner
i
have
ever
known
i
remarked
she
bowed
in
answer
well
pleased
in
truth
the
accent
of
madame
grambeau
was
barely
detectable
and
her
phraseology
was
that
of
a
book
correct
but
not
idiomatic
and
bearing
about
it
the
idiosyncrasy
of
the
language
from
which
it
was
derived
she
was
evidently
a
person
of
culture
and
native
power
of
intellect
combined
and
her
face
as
well
as
every
gesture
and
tone
indicated
superiority
and
character
in
that
lonely
wild
and
beneath
that
lowly
roof
there
abode
a
spirit
able
and
worthy
to
lead
the
of
the
great
and
to
preside
over
the
councils
of
statesmen
and
to
rise
in
climax
the
of
the
but
it
was
her
whim
rather
than
her
necessity
to
tarry
where
she
could
alone
be
strictly
independent
a
qua
of
her
being
the
son
she
had
led
by
the
hand
from
hew
york
to
georgia
and
who
standing
by
her
side
distinctly
remembered
to
have
seen
the
head
of
the
princess
lamballe
borne
on
a
pole
through
the
streets
of
paris
was
now
a
prominent
member
of
the
legislature
and
through
his
rich
wife
the
incumbent
of
a
great
plantation
but
the
teachings
of
rousseau
that
philosophic
still
influenced
his
mother
in
her
refusal
to
live
under
his
splendid
roof
and
partake
of
his
bounty
however
liberally
offered
i
have
a
home
of
my
own
she
said
a
few
faithful
servants
brains
and
energy
still
besides
a
small
account
with
general
curzon
in
his
bank
at
savannah
wherewith
to
meet
emergencies
while
these
things
last
i
will
owe
to
no
man
or
woman
for
bread
or
shelter
and
when
these
depart
may
the
grave
cover
my
bones
and
the
good
god
receive
my
soul
books
alone
she
accepted
as
gifts
from
her
son
and
of
these
in
a
little
library
she
had
a
goodly
store
in
the
two
languages
which
she
read
with
equal
facility
if
not
delight
she
showed
us
this
nook
before
we
left
and
i
saw
lying
face
downward
as
she
had
recently
left
it
the
volume
she
was
then
perusing
at
intervals
one
of
madame
sand
novels
les
mauprats
i
remember
a
singular
and
powerful
romance
then
recently
issued
whose
root
i
have
always
thought
might
be
found
in
walter
scott
rob
roy
and
more
particularly
in
the
osbaldistone
family
commemorated
in
that
work
on
suggesting
this
to
madame
grambeau
she
too
saw
the
resemblance
i
spoke
of
and
she
agreed
with
me
that
the
coincidence
of
genius
furnished
many
such
parallels
where
no
charge
of
plagiarism
could
be
attached
to
either
side
a
few
bottles
of
wine
as
elizabeth
barrett
called
such
fluids
were
added
to
the
dinner
toward
its
close
and
marion
begged
permission
to
have
her
basket
of
cakes
and
fruits
brought
in
for
dessert
which
else
had
been
wanting
to
our
repast
to
which
request
madame
grambeau
graciously
acceded
i
make
no
confections
she
said
but
i
have
lived
on
the
juices
of
good
meats
well
prepared
with
such
vegetables
as
the
lord
lets
grow
in
this
poor
region
many
years
and
behold
i
am
old
and
still
able
to
do
his
service
and
a
little
good
wine
too
occasionally
eh
madame
added
major
favraud
impertinently
when
attainable
favraud
you
drank
good
wine
yourself
when
you
were
here
and
i
partook
with
you
moderately
but
i
buy
none
such
i
drown
not
even
in
butts
of
malmsey
my
gold
and
i
own
i
am
not
fond
of
the
juices
of
the
muscadine
of
your
hills
and
she
tapped
her
snuffbox
you
are
going
to
hear
her
talk
now
whispered
favraud
that
is
a
sign
equal
to
general
finistere
the
snuffbox
tapping
i
mean
the
oracle
is
beginning
to
arouse
come
i
let
me
stir
her
further
and
he
inclined
his
head
before
her
i
tell
you
what
madame
you
must
take
a
little
cognac
to
keep
off
the
chills
of
age
i
have
some
of
the
best
and
will
send
you
down
a
demijohn
if
you
say
the
word
and
in
return
you
shall
pray
for
me
i
am
a
great
sinner
miss
harz
thinks
miss
harz
is
correct
and
we
will
both
promise
you
our
prayers
she
too
is
catholic
i
hope
no
i
regret
so
for
her
own
sake
but
your
brandy
i
reject
victor
remember
that
and
offend
me
not
by
sending
it
you
must
not
forget
the
fate
of
your
malvoisie
ah
madame
that
was
cruel
but
i
have
forgiven
you
long
since
i
think
however
that
the
bore
better
that
year
than
ever
before
thus
watered
or
wined
i
just
think
of
it
miss
harz
to
pour
good
wine
round
the
roots
of
a
fontainebleau
grape
rather
than
replenish
the
springs
of
life
with
it
was
there
ever
waste
like
that
since
cleopatra
dissolved
her
pearl
in
vinegar
miss
harz
will
agree
with
me
that
a
principle
that
could
not
resist
the
gift
of
a
dozen
bottles
of
choice
wine
was
little
worth
of
such
stuff
was
made
not
the
fathers
of
your
revolution
but
stay
there
is
an
explanation
due
to
me
yet
unrendered
she
pursued
i
am
a
puzzled
i
confess
she
said
shaking
her
head
come
favraud
explain
who
is
this
young
lady
a
also
i
replied
for
him
anxious
to
turn
the
tide
of
conversation
into
another
channel
for
some
reasons
i
had
thought
you
an
expatriated
marquise
at
least
madame
i
continued
as
for
me
i
am
simply
a
governess
it
is
my
glory
mademoiselle
to
have
been
of
that
class
to
which
belonged
madame
roland
herself
and
which
represented
that
which
maintained
the
balance
of
society
in
france
when
the
dregs
of
the
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
revolution
commenced
by
the
sound
middle
classes
we
regarded
the
scum
of
aristocracy
as
the
smaller
of
the
two
evils
as
soon
as
the
true
element
had
ceased
to
assert
itself
in
france
i
fled
forever
from
a
land
of
bloodshed
and
misrule
and
took
shelter
under
the
broad
wing
of
your
boasted
american
eagle
which
still
continues
to
flap
over
you
shelteringly
madame
i
rejoined
somewhat
flippantly
i
fear
and
will
to
the
end
no
doubt
for
in
its
very
organization
our
country
can
never
be
subjected
to
the
fluctuations
of
other
lands
revolt
and
revolution
i
am
not
so
certain
of
this
she
observed
shaking
her
white
head
slowly
as
she
spoke
and
lifting
a
pinch
of
snuff
from
her
box
the
companion
of
her
whole
married
life
as
she
acquainted
us
she
inhaled
it
with
an
air
of
meditative
then
offered
it
quietly
to
the
gentlemen
who
were
still
sitting
over
their
wine
and
peaches
passing
by
marion
alice
durand
and
myself
completely
in
this
ovation
good
snuff
is
not
to
be
sneezed
at
said
major
favraud
none
offered
to
young
ladies
it
seems
taking
a
huge
pinch
and
thrusting
it
bravely
up
his
nostrils
as
one
takes
a
spoonful
of
unpleasant
medicine
then
contradicting
his
own
assertion
immediately
afterward
he
succeeded
in
expelling
most
of
it
in
a
series
of
violent
sternutatory
spasms
which
left
him
breathless
and
with
a
handkerchief
much
begrimed
but
madame
grambeau
seemed
not
to
have
noticed
this
ridiculous
proceeding
which
of
course
created
momentary
mirth
at
the
expense
of
the
penitent
favraud
to
whom
durand
repeated
the
tantalizing
saying
that
it
is
a
royal
privilege
to
take
snuff
gracefully
giving
the
example
as
he
spoke
in
a
manner
quite
as
absurd
and
irrelevant
as
favraud
own
lost
in
deep
thought
and
gently
tapping
her
snuffbox
as
she
mused
the
tripod
of
her
inspiration
as
it
seemed
madame
grambeau
sat
silently
with
what
memories
of
the
past
and
what
insight
into
the
future
none
can
know
save
those
like
herself
grown
hoary
with
wisdom
and
experience
at
last
she
spoke
addressing
her
remarks
to
me
as
though
the
careless
words
i
had
hazarded
had
just
been
spoken
and
the
attention
of
her
hearers
undiverted
by
divers
absurdities
among
others
the
affected
gambols
of
duganne
anxious
to
place
himself
in
an
agreeable
aspect
before
both
of
his
past
and
present
i
do
not
agree
with
you
mademoiselle
i
am
one
of
those
who
think
that
in
the
very
framing
of
this
constitution
of
ours
the
dragon
teeth
were
sown
whose
harvest
is
not
yet
produced
calhoun
with
his
prophetic
eye
foresees
that
this
crop
of
armed
men
is
inevitable
from
such
germs
as
does
clay
were
he
only
frank
which
he
is
not
because
he
deludes
himself
the
most
incurable
and
inexcusable
of
all
deceptions
and
she
applied
herself
again
assiduously
to
her
snuffbox
tapping
it
peremptorily
before
opening
it
and
with
a
gloomy
eye
fixed
on
space
she
continued
in
all
lands
from
the
time
of
cassandra
and
jeremiah
up
there
have
been
prophets
prophets
for
good
and
prophets
for
ill
of
which
some
few
have
been
and
the
sayings
of
such
alone
have
been
preserved
the
rest
vanish
away
into
oblivion
like
chaff
before
the
wind
never
mind
what
their
achievement
what
their
boast
in
this
nation
we
have
only
two
true
prophets
calhoun
and
clay
both
men
of
equal
might
and
resolution
and
intellect
gifted
as
beseems
their
vocation
masterful
and
heroic
and
to
these
all
other
men
are
subordinate
in
the
great
designs
of
providence
where
do
you
leave
webster
john
quincy
adams
general
jackson
himself
in
such
a
category
madame
i
asked
eagerly
they
are
doing
or
have
done
the
work
god
has
appointed
for
them
to
do
i
suppose
mademoiselle
but
they
are
accessories
merely
of
the
times
and
will
pass
away
with
the
necessities
of
the
moment
earth
has
bubbles
as
the
water
hath
and
these
are
of
them
said
major
favraud
aside
between
his
short
set
teeth
nodding
to
me
as
he
spoke
and
lending
the
next
moment
implicit
attention
to
what
madame
grambeau
was
saying
for
the
brief
pause
she
had
made
for
another
pinch
of
snuff
was
ended
and
she
continued
impetuously
as
if
no
interval
had
occurred
clay
is
unconsciously
i
trust
for
the
honor
of
mankind
fulfilling
his
destiny
this
great
prophet
who
still
refuses
to
prophesy
he
is
entering
the
wedge
for
what
he
declines
to
admit
the
possibility
of
yet
there
must
be
moments
when
that
eye
of
power
pierces
the
clouds
of
prejudice
and
party
wherewith
it
seeks
to
blind
its
kingly
vision
and
descries
the
horrors
beyond
as
the
result
of
the
acts
he
is
now
committing
and
when
such
moments
of
clear
conviction
come
to
him
the
ambitions
tool
of
a
party
i
envy
not
his
sensations
and
she
shook
her
head
mournfully
not
napoleon
at
helena
not
prometheus
on
his
rock
were
more
to
be
pitied
than
he
the
man
whose
ambition
shall
never
know
fruition
whose
measures
shall
pass
and
leave
no
trace
in
less
than
fifty
years
after
he
has
ceased
to
exist
the
splendid
failure
of
our
century
she
ceased
for
a
moment
with
her
eye
fixed
on
space
her
hands
clasped
her
whole
face
and
manner
uplifted
as
if
indeed
on
her
likewise
the
prophet
mantle
had
dropped
from
a
chariot
of
fire
as
to
calhoun
he
is
she
continued
fervently
in
the
solitudes
of
a
spiritual
mount
sinai
he
has
received
the
tablets
of
the
lord
and
bends
every
energy
to
their
fulfillment
he
too
foresees
not
with
an
eye
like
clay
clear
only
at
intervals
and
clouded
by
vanity
ambition
and
sophistry
at
other
seasons
he
too
foresees
the
coming
of
our
doom
his
clear
vision
embraces
anarchy
dissension
civil
war
with
all
its
attendant
horrors
as
the
consequence
of
man
injustice
and
like
moses
he
beholds
the
promised
land
into
which
he
can
never
enter
would
that
it
were
given
to
him
to
appoint
his
joshua
or
even
to
see
him
face
to
face
recognizingly
but
this
is
not
god
will
he
lurks
among
the
shadows
yet
this
joshua
of
the
south
but
god
shall
yet
search
him
out
and
bring
him
visibly
before
the
people
not
while
i
live
she
added
solemnly
but
within
the
natural
lives
of
all
others
who
sit
this
day
around
my
table
she
is
equal
to
madame
le
normand
said
major
favraud
aside
nodding
approvingly
at
me
if
one
waits
long
enough
most
prophecies
may
be
fulfilled
i
ventured
but
madame
your
words
point
to
results
too
terrible
too
unnatural
it
seems
to
me
ever
to
be
realized
in
these
enlightened
times
or
in
this
land
of
moderation
child
she
responded
blood
asserts
itself
to
the
end
of
races
there
are
two
separate
civilizations
in
this
land
destined
some
day
to
come
in
fearful
conflict
and
the
wars
of
scylla
of
the
jews
themselves
shall
be
outdone
in
the
horror
and
persistence
of
that
strife
of
partners
i
will
not
say
brothers
for
there
is
no
brotherhood
of
blood
between
south
and
north
of
which
clay
and
calhoun
stand
forth
to
my
mind
as
distinct
types
no
union
of
the
red
and
white
roses
possible
but
you
forget
madame
that
clay
is
a
western
man
a
virginian
a
kentuckian
and
the
representative
of
i
remonstrated
his
interests
are
coincident
with
those
of
the
south
his
hope
of
the
presidency
itself
vests
in
his
constituents
and
the
wand
would
be
broken
in
his
hand
were
he
to
lend
himself
to
partiality
of
any
kind
clay
is
a
great
patriot
i
believe
jacksonite
though
i
am
he
knows
no
south
nor
north
nor
east
nor
west
but
the
union
alone
solid
and
undivided
all
this
is
true
she
answered
in
one
sense
it
is
thus
he
speaks
and
like
all
partial
parents
even
thinks
he
feels
toward
his
offspring
but
observe
his
acts
narrowly
from
first
to
last
he
has
a
manufacturer
heart
with
all
his
genius
he
loves
machinery
the
sound
of
the
mill
the
anvil
the
the
sight
of
the
ship
upon
the
or
steamboat
on
the
river
the
roar
of
commerce
far
more
than
the
work

if
she
saw
from
some
spiritual
height
the
reign
of
terror
she
predicted
she
dropped
her
head
upon
her
hands
and
closed
her
eyes
and
i
felt
my
blood
creep
slowly
through
my
veins
as
i
followed
her
in
thought
across
the
waste
of
woe
and
desolation
for
there
was
something
in
her
manner
her
voice
august
and
solemn
with
age
and
wisdom
as
these
were
that
impressed
all
who
heard
with
or
in
spite
of
their
own
consent
and
for
a
time
profound
silence
succeeded
this
harangue
durand
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
i
trust
my
dear
madame
he
remarked
that
the
substantial
horrors
realized
in
your
youth
still
cast
their
dark
shadows
over
the
coming
years
and
so
deceive
you
into
prophecies
that
it
is
sad
to
hear
from
lips
so
reverent
and
which
let
us
all
pray
may
never
be
realized
you
yourself
will
say
amen
to
that
i
am
convinced
amen
she
murmured
nonsense
durand
do
play
at
hypocrite
in
your
old
age
after
having
been
a
true
man
all
your
life
broke
in
major
favraud
what
is
a
conservative
after
all
but
a
social
parrot
who
repeats
saws
and
modern
instances
until
he
believes
himself
possessed
of
the
wisdom
of
all
the
ages
and
is
incapable
of
conceiving
of
the
existence
even
of
an
original
idea
digressed
duganne
weary
of
discussion
hear
that
old
fellow
outside
how
he
is
going
on
favraud
of
poll
parrots
you
know
as
it
all
else
but
the
name
of
the
bird
had
been
lost
on
his
ear
just
listen
yes
hear
him
and
he
edified
was
the
sarcastic
response
of
favraud
to
duganne
who
took
no
other
notice
even
if
he
understood
the
point
than
to
lead
the
way
to
the
portico
where
swung
the
cage
of
the
jolly
bird
in
question
and
headed
by
madame
grambeau
leaning
on
her
cane
we
followed
simultaneously
with
the
exception
of
major
favraud
who
continued
at
the
table
with
his
cigar
and
in
sullen
and
solitary
state
nutmegs
and
nullification
shrieked
the
parrot
as
we
stood
before
him
ha
ha
ha
that
is
condensing
the
matter
certainly
i
observed
he
repeated
many
times
laughing
loudly
the
next
moment
as
if
in
mockery
what
a
fiend
it
is
said
marion
timidly
only
look
at
its
black
tongue
miss
harz
then
what
a
laugh
danton
danton
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
this
strange
lady

madame
grambeau
addressing
her
bird
by
name
you
must
not
neglect
my

pardi

the
whimsical
rejoinder

give
us
your

old
hick

hickory
this
is
the
stuff
major
favraud
taught
him
she
apologized
when
he
used
to
lie
on
his
porch
day
after
day
after
his
hostile
meeting
with
juarez
which
took
place
on
that
hill
signifying
the
site
of
the
duel
with
her
slender
cane
it
was
there
they
fought
their
duel
and
i
knew
it
not
until
too
late
his
wife
was
too
ill
to
come
to
him
at
that
time
and
the
task
of
nursing
him
devolved
on
me
since
when
on
maternal
principles
the
lad
has
grown
into
my
affections
the
lad
of
sneered
duganne
unnoticed
apparently
by
the
aged
lady
however
at
the
moment
but
not
without
amusing
other
hearers
by
this
sally
durand
was
especially
delighted
for
he
is
a
boy
at
heart
she
said
later
this
same
victor
favraud
of
ours
gazing
reprovingly
around
indeed
he
is
the
only
american
i
have
ever
seen
who
possessed
real
de
and
for
that
i
imagine
he
must
thank
his
french
extraction
calhoun
and
cotton
coal
and
codfish
shouted
the
parrot
at
the
top
of
his
voice
catfish
and
coffee
rice
cakes
for
breakfast
all
in
my
eye
betty
martin
yarns
and
yankees
shad
and
yams
and
yaller
boys
and
so
on
in
a
string
of
the
most
irrelevant
alliteration
and
folly
that
like
much
other
nonsense
evoked
peals
of
laughter
by
its
unexpected
utterance
and
which
at
last
mollified
and
brought
out
major
favraud
himself
from
his
dignified
retirement
you
have
ruined
the
morals
of
my
bird
said
madame
grambeau
reproachfully
approach
favraud
and
justify
yourself
in
former
times
his
discourse
was
discreet
he
knew
many
wise
proverbs
and
polite
salutations
in
french
and
english
both
most
of
which
he
has
discarded
in
favor
of
your
profane
and
foolish
teachings
he
is
as
bad
as
the
of
voltaire
i
shall
have
to
expel
him
soon
i
fear
danton
how
can
you
so
grieve
your
mistress
remonstrated
major
favraud
lifting
at
the
same
time
an
admonitory
finger
at
which
recognized
signal
a
part
of
past
instructions
probably
the
parrot
burst
forth
at
once
in
a
series
of
the
most
grotesque
and
oaths
ear
ever
heard
ending
by
the
aid
of
some
prompting
from
his
teacher
by
dismally
croaking
the
fragment
of
a
popular
song

travestied

the
memory
of
the
creature
is
perfectly
wonderful
i
said
many
parrots
have
i
seen
but
never
one
like
this
before
it
must
have
sprung
out
of
the
arabian
nights
i
can
teach
any
thing
to
every
thing
digressed

favraud

without
severity
it
is
my
specialty

was
meant
for
a
trainer
of
beasts
probably
i
will
get
up
an
entertainment
i
believe
in
opposition
to
the
industrious
fleas
called
the
doves
and
teach
pigeons
to
muster
drill
and
go
through
all
the
military
motions
i
could
do
it
easily
and
so
repair
my
broken
fortunes
i
have
one
already
at
home
that
feigns
death
at
the
word

command
i
have
amused
myself

hours

a
time
with
this
do
say
a
word
miss
harz
speaking
low
i
see
what
you
think
of
it
all
but
i
have
had
to
cheat
misery
some
way
or
other
it
was
a
wretched
device
and
waste
of
existence
though
and
when
i
see
that
great
distinguished
man
who
had
such
hopes
of
me
as
a
boy
i
feel
that
i
could
creep
into

sheer

of
my
extinguished

under
a

destined

be
fulfilled
only
in
the
grave
he
said
sadly
with
the
promise
common
to
all
mankind
and
thus
by
gloomy
glimpses
i
caught
the
truth
we
staid
that
night
at
the
house
of
an
aunt
of
madame
la
vigne
who
received
us
cordially
entertained
us
sumptuously

dismissed
us
graciously
the
next
morning
at

we
again
set
out
for

we
entered
before
the
noonday

finding
cool
shelter
and
warm
welcome
at
once
under

the
south
most
polished
gentleman
and
finished
man
of

may

remembered
by
some
of
my
readers
chapter
ii
before
leaving
the
hospitable
roof
of
general
curzon
beneath
which
i
tarried
for
several
days
awaiting
the
tardy
sailing
of
the
kosciusko
bound
for
new
york
circumstances
determined
me
to
leave
in
the
hands
of
my
host
a
desk
which
i
had
intended
to
carry
with
me
and
which
contained
most
of
my
treasures
first
among
these
indisputably
in
intrinsic
value
were
my
diamonds
sole
remnant
of
a
past
magnificence
but
the
miniatures
of
my
father
and
mother
and
mabel
in
the
cases
of
which
locks
of
twisted
hair
brown
and
black
and
golden
and
gray
were
contained
and
combined
dear
imperishable
memorials
of
vitality
in
most
instances
when
all
the
rest
was
dust
and
ashes
and
the
early
letters
of
my
parents
together
with
the
diary
i
had
written
at
beauseincourt
ranked
beyond
these
even
in
my
estimation
the
cause
of
this
deposit
of
valuables
was
simply
owing
to
the
unstable
lock
of
my
trunk
the
condition
of
which
was
detected
too
late
to
have
it
repaired
before
sailing
madame
curzon
had
suggested
to
me
the
unsafe
nature
of
such
custody
for
objects
of
price
if
indeed
i
possessed
such
at
all
i
told
her
then
of
my
diamonds
and
it
was
agreed
between
us
that
these
at
least
had
better
be
deposited
in
the
bank
of
her
husband
who
would
bring
them
to
me
himself
a
few
months
later
and
on
reflection
i
concluded
to
add
my
desk
pictures
and
papers
to
more
substantial
treasures
these
at
least
i
felt
assured
no
accident
should
throw
into
the
hands
of
bainrothe
on
my
way
to
the
ship
i
left
the
carriage
for
a
moment
in
pursuance
with
this
idea
and
followed
by
king
the
bearer
of
my
large
and
weighty
desk
entered
the
of
my
host
and
was
shown
at
once
by
attentive
clerks
to
his
peculiar
sanctum
i
told
him
my
errand
in
a
few
words
keep
it
until
called
for
unless
you
hear
from
me
in
the
interval
i
had
said
in
allusion
to
my
deposit
for
he
acknowledged
the
chances
were
slight
of
his
leaving
home
until
the
following
year
notwithstanding
madame
curzon
convictions
called
for
by
whom
he
asked
calmly
by
miriam
monfort
in
person
or
her
order
i
replied
laughingly
this
is
a
mystery
that
shall
be
explained
to
you
i
understand
something
of
that
already
he
rejoined
marion
has
been
whispering
to
the
reeds
you
know
or
madame
curzon
the
same
thing
nearly
but
let
us
be
earnest
as
your
time
is
short
and
mine
precious
life
is
uncertain
and
young
and
strong
as
you
are
or
seem
to
be
you
can
not
foresee
one
hour
even
of
the
future
or
of
your
own
existence
suppose
miriam
monfort
neither
comes
in
person
nor
sends
her
order
for
its
restoration
what
then
is
to
become
of
this
of
hers
you
shall
keep
it
then
i
replied
unhesitatingly
until
my
little
sister
reaches
her
majority
and
cause
it
to
be
placed
in
her
own
hands
none
other
or
stay
let
her
have
it
on
the
day
before
her
marriage
should
this
occur
earlier
than
the
time
mentioned
or
when
she
reaches
her
eighteenth
year
in
any
case
but
above
all
things
be
careful
so
many
conflicting
directions
confuse
and
mystify
me
i
confess
come
let
me
write
down
your
wishes
and
the
matter
can
be
arranged
formally
which
is
always
best
in
any
case
there
i
think
i
have
the
gist
of
your
idea
he
said
a
few
moments
later
as
he
pushed
over
to
me
a
slip
of
paper
to
read
and
sign
which
done
i
shook
hands
with
him
cordially
preparing
to
go
but
your
receipt
you
have
forgotten
to
take
it
up
o
general
curzon
the
whole
proceeding
seems
so
ominous
i
said
turning
back
at
the
door
to
receive
the
proffered
scrap
which
in
another
moment
dropped
from
my
nerveless
fingers
while
these
clasped
over
my
streaming
eyes
forgot
their
office
my
dear
young
lady
he
remonstrated
i
am
shocked
what
can
have
occurred
to
impress
you
thus
not
this
mere
routine
of
affairs
surely
duncan
a
glass
of
water
here
for
miss
monfort
i
do
not
know
i
am
sure
why
i
should
be
so
weak
for
such
a
trifle
i
said
after
a
few
swallows
of
had
somewhat
restored
my
equilibrium
but
i
do
feel
very
dismally
about
this
voyage
have
done
so
ever
since
i
left
beauseincourt
this
is
the
last
straw
on
the
camel
back
believe
me
general
curzon
you
must
not
reproach
yourself
in
the
least
nor
me
and
now
let
me
bid
you
farewell
once
more
perhaps
eternally
these
words
of
mine
were
remembered
later
in
a
very
different
spirit
from
that
in
which
they
were
then
received
one
of
incredulous
compassion
remembered
as
are
ever
the
last
utterances
of
the
doomed
whether
innocent
or
guilty
in
solemn
awe
and
reverential
tenderness
not
unmingled
with
a
superstitions
faith
in
presentiment
why
you
look
bluer
than
your
very
obvious
veil
bluer
than
your
invisible
stockings
bluer
than
the
skies
or
a
blue
bag
or
madame
de
staÃ«l
or
byron
ocean
said
major
favraud
as
he
assisted
me
again
into
the
carriage
where
durand
and
marion
awaited
me
for
as
i
have
said
we
were
now
on
our
way
to
the
vessel
which
was
to
bear
me
and
my
destinies
forever
from
that
lovely
southern
land
in
which
i
had
seen
and
suffered
so
much
durand
looked
serious
at
the
sight
of
my
woful
aspect
and
marion
mutely
proffered
her
gratefully
accepted
as
was
the
good
doctor
compassionate
silence
but
as
usual
favraud
after
having
once
gotten
fairly
under
weigh
ran
on
what
is
the
use
of
bewailing
the
inevitable
he
pursued
we
have
all
seen
your
for
curzon
and
his
for
you
for
three
days
past
but
octavia
is
as
tough
as
i
regret
to
assure
you
my
dear
miss
harz
and
your
chance
is
as
your
spirits
or
the
flames
of
or
marion
eyes
you
will
have
to
just
put
up
with
the
captain
i
fear
for
even
the
doctor
there
is
in
harness
for
life
southern
women
you
know
proverbially
survive
their
husbands
and
as
the
suttee
is
out
of
fashion
they
sometimes
have
to
marry
yankees
as
a
of
desperation
of
course
there
are
occasional
sad
exceptions
looking
grave
for
a
moment
and
glancing
at
the
black
on
the
panama
hat
he
was
nursing
on
his
knees
so
as
to
let
the
breeze
blow
through
his
silky
black
hair
but
but
in
short
why
will
you
all
look
so
doleful
is
it
bad
enough
to
feel
so
the
loveliest
fade
earliest
we
all
know
and
the
tears
were
in
his
honest
frivolous
eyes
dashed
away
in
the
next
moment
as
he
exclaimed
eagerly
why
there
goes
the
lamarque
equipage
as
i
live
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
the
pleasantest
woman
in
savannah
young
or
old
is
to
be
your
de
miss
harz
and
the
most
determined
widower
on
record
her
escort
a
perfect
john
rogers
of
a
man
with
nine
little
motherless
children
her
brother
raguet
as
we
called
him
at
school
on
account
of
his
prim
stiffness
so
that
as
a
seemed
a
most
preposterous
saying
in
his
vicinity
he
is
handsome
however
and
intelligent
a
perfect
gentleman
but
on
the
bench
just
now
like
some
others
you
know
of
heaving
a
deep
sigh
his
wife
poor
thing
died
last
autumn
a
pretty
girl
in
her
day
was
cornelia
huger
i
was
a
little
weak
in
that
direction
once
myself
before
that
is
before
o
doctor
what
a
trouble
it
is
to
remember
and
again
the
small
fleet
hand
was
dashed
across
the
twinkling
tearful
eyes
of
this
april
day
of
a
man
of
the
world
this
modern
mercutio
merry
and
mournful
at
once
as
if
there
were
two
sides
to
his
every
mood
like
the
famous
shield
of
story
when
we
reached
the
quay
the
kosciusko
was
already
getting
up
her
steam
and
in
less
than
an
hour
afterward
the
friends
i
loved
were
gone
like
dreams
the
bustle
of
departure
was
over
and
with
lifted
canvas
and
a
puffing
engine
we
were
grandly
steaming
past
the
noble
forts
poor
bertie
broach
and
buckle
be
it
remembered
on
our
path
of
pride
and
power
toward
the
broad
atlantic
the
weather
was
oppressively
hot
and
for
the
first
hours
scarcely
a
breath
of
wind
lifted
us
on
our
way
so
that
the
engine
wholly
incompetent
to
the
work
of
both
sails
and
machinery
bore
us
very
slowly
on
our
northward
indeed
the
failure
of
this
engine
to
do
its
duty
at
first
had
sorely
disheartened
both
captain
and
crew
as
we
found
later
for
upon
its
execution
and
energies
in
the
beginning
had
rested
our
entire
dependence
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
voyage
a
sudden
and
violent
occurred
not
unusual
in
those
latitudes
during
the
raging
of
which
our
mainmast
was
struck
by
lightning
and
wholly
disabled
the
fire
was
extinguished
in
the
only
possible
manner
by
cutting
it
away
from
the
decks
letting
it
gently
down
upon
them
deluging
it
so
that
our
mast
lay
charred
and
blackened
after
its
bath
of
like
a
mighty
serpent
stretched
along
the
ship
from
stem
to
stern
and
wrapped
loosely
in
its
shrouds
it
did
us
good
service
later
though
not
by
defying
the
winds
of
heaven
nor
spreading
forth
its
snowy
sails
to
catch
the
tropic
breezes
before
many
hours
it
was
destined
to
ride
the
waves
in
a
shape
that
was
certainly
never
intended
by
those
who
chose
it
among
many
others
taper
and
stately
in
its
group
of
firs
to
be
the
chief
adornment
of
a
gallant
ship
and
lift
a
pointing
finger
to
the
stars
themselves
as
an
index
of
its
might
and
with
this
exception
the
hope
of
those
it
served
that
of
a
charred
and
blackened
the
renewed
freshness
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
joyful
upspringing
of
the
breezes
alone
remained
at
midnight
to
tell
the
story
of
the
recent
hurricane
these
tropic
breezes
came
like
benevolent
fairies
to
aid
our
groaning
titan
in
his
labors
i
can
never
rid
myself
for
one
moment
of
the
idea
that
an
engine
really
works
with
weary
reluctant
strength
like
a
genii
slave
waiting
vengefully
for
the
time
of
retaliation
which
sooner
or
later
is
sure
to
come
or
of
the
visionary
notion
that
a
graceful
gliding
ship
with
all
sails
set
receives
the
same
pleasure
from
its
own
motion
and
beauty
that
a
swan
must
do
as
down
she
bears
before
the
gale
with
her
white
plumage
and
stately
crest
i
think
if
ever
i
am
called
to
give
a
toast
it
shall
be
may
their
shadows
never
be
less
they
are
indeed
a
part
of
the
romance
of
ocean
the
moon
was
full
in
the
balmy
summer
night
that
succeeded
the
tempest
and
the
ship
was
crowded
with
the
passengers
of
the
kosciusko
enjoying
to
the
utmost
as
it
seemed
the
delicious
atmosphere
the
moonlit
heavens
and
sea
the
softness
of
the
breezes
that
filled
the
white
sails
of
the
vessel
and
fluttered
the
silken
scarf
of
the
maiden
with
the
same
wooing
breath
of
persuasive
subtle
strength
around
miss
lamarque
the
lady
of
whom
major
favraud
had
spoken
so
admiringly
and
to
whose
kindness
he
had
committed
me
a
group
had
gathered
chiefly
of
the
young
not
to
be
surpassed
in
any
land
for
manly
bearing
graceful
feminine
beauty
gayety
wit
and
refinement
there
was
helen
oscanyan
fair
as
a
dream
of
greece
in
her
serene
marble
perfectness
of
form
and
feature
and
the
lovely
mollie
cairns
her
cousin
small
dark
and
sparkling
both
under
the
care
of
that
stately
gentleman
their
uncle
julius
sevÃ¨re
of
savannah
and
there
were
the
sisters
percy
twins
in
age
and
appearance
with
voices
like
and
eyes
like
and
feet
of
chinese
minuteness
and
french
perfection
the
darlings
and
only
joys
of
a
mother
still
beautiful
though
sad
in
her
widowhood
and
gentle
as
the
dove
that
mourns
its
mate
there
was
the
brilliant
ralph
maxwell
whose
jests
stinging
and
slight
just
glanced
over
the
surface
of
society
without
inflicting
a
wound
even
as
the
skater
heel
glides
over
ice
leaving
its
mark
as
it
goes
yet
breaking
no
crust
of
frost
and
there
was
the
poetic
dreamer
dartmore
with
his
large
dark
eyes
and
moonlight
face
and
manner
of
suffering
serenity
on
his
way
to
put
forth
for
fame
as
he
fondly
believed
his
manuscript
epic
on
the
sorrows
of
the
south
all
these
and
more
were
there
gathering
about
the
leader
of
their
on
that
alien
deck
as
securely
as
though
they
were
sitting
in
her
own
at
berthold
on
one
of
her
brilliant
how
could
they
know
how
could
they
dream
the
truth
or
descry
the
hidden
skeleton
at
the
festival
wreathed
in
flowers
and
veiled
with
glittering
filmy
draperies
which
yet
put
forth
its
bony
fingers
to
beckon
on
and
clutch
them
i
too
was
joyous
and
unconscious
as
the
rest
and
for
the
first
time
for
many
days
felt
the
burden
literally
heaved
rather
than
lifted
away
that
had
oppressed
me
was
i
not
on
my
way
to
him
in
whose
presence
alone
i
lived
my
true
life
and
what
feeling
of
his
morbid
fancy
was
there
that
my
hand
could
not
smooth
away
when
once
entwined
in
his
beauseincourt
and
all
its
shadows
had
i
not
put
behind
me
the
sunshine
lay
before
and
in
its
light
and
warmth
i
should
still
rejoice
as
it
was
my
birthright
to
do
i
was
fey
that
night
as
the
scotch
say
when
an
unaccountable
lightness
of
mood
precedes
a
heavy
sorrow
which
it
so
often
does
as
well
as
the
more
usual
mood
the
presage
of
gloom
i
felt
that
i
had
the
power
to
put
aside
all
ills
to
grapple
with
my
fate
and
compel
back
my
lost
happiness
truly
my
bosom
lord
sat
lightly
on
her
throne
as
of
late
it
had
not
been
her
wont
to
do
against
my
inclination
had
i
been
drawn
into
the
current
of
that
youthful
gayety
and
now
my
bark
floated
without
an
effort
on
the
stream
i
was
in
my
own
element
again
and
my
powers
were
all
responsive
the
small
hours
came
the
happy
group
dispersed
not
without
many
interchanges
of
social
compliment
much
and
merry
plans
for
the
morrow
the
monster
had
been
defied
on
the
balmy
voyage
save
in
the
brief
interval
of
tempest
and
his
victors
mocked
him
baffled
as
he
was
with
their
purpose
of
amusement
we
shall
get
up
the
band
evening
said
major
ravenel
and
have
a
dance
the
gallop
would
go
grandly
here
see
what
reach
of
we
have
there
are
germans
on
board
who
play
in
concert
violins
and
suppose
we
dress
as
said
honoria
pyne
enact
a
masque
for
old
neptune
benefit
it
would
be
so
complimentary
you
know
bring
down
the
house
no
doubt
i
have
a
tarlatan
lying
so
conveniently
colonel
latrobe
looks
exactly
like
a
triton
with
that
wondrous
beard
a
little
alum
sprinkled
over
its
ground
would
do
wonders
in
the
way
of
effect
would
be
gorgeous
would
it
now
miss
harz
but
all
that
could
be
done
on
shore
as
well
miss
pyne
i
replied
in
the
way
of
reminiscence
it
is
a
pity
to
waste
our
opportunities
of
observation
now
in
getting
up
costumes
and
for
my
part
i
confess
that
i
have
a
wholesome
dread
of
these
and
fear
to
exasperate
their
finny
feelings
by
reducing
them
to
effigies
thetis
is
very
spiteful
sometimes
and
jealous
too
you
remember
miss
pyne
did
not
remember
but
did
not
mean
to
be
baffled
either
she
would
let
miss
harz
know
even
if
that
lady
know
more
about
mythology
than
herself
and
if
no
one
else
would
join
her
meant
to
play
her
of
all
alone
with
major
latrobe
for
her
triton
in
waiting
tooting
upon
a
and
looking
lovely
at
which
compliment
open
and
poor
major
latrobe
who
was
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
and
a
very
ugly
man
only
bowed
and
looked
more
silly
than
before
which
seemed
a
work
of
supererogation
after
the
rest
were
gone
miss
lamarque
and
i
concluded
to
promenade
on
the
deck
in
the
moonlight
and
let
the
excitement
of
the
evening
die
away
through
the
medium
of
more
serious
conversation
she
was
a
woman
of
still
graceful
and
but
bearing
few
traces
of
earlier
beauty
probably
better
to
behold
in
her
overripe
maturity
than
in
the
unfolding
of
her
less
attractive
time
of
bud
and
blossom
self
had
been
laid
aside
now
which
it
never
can
be
until
the
effervescence
of
youth
and
hope
are
over
she
had
accepted
her
position
of
old
maid
and
universal
benefactress
and
sustained
it
nobly
gracefully
she
was
thoroughly
and
agreeable
very
vivacious
astute
and
intelligent
rather
than
intellectual
yet
she
had
the
capacity
had
her
training
been
different
to
have
been
both
of
these
i
remember
how
it
chanced
that
after
a
long
promenade
during
which
we
had
discussed
men
manners
books
customs
costumes
and
politics
even
that
once
tabooed
subject
for
women
now
free
to
all
with
infinite
zest
and
responsiveness
that
charmed
us
mutually
so
that
we
swore
allegiance
on
the
strength
of
this
one
day
rencontre
like
two
or
knights
of
old
i
remember
how
the
dropping
of
her
comb
at
his
feet
caused
miss
lamarque
to
pause
compelling
me
to
follow
her
example
by
reason
of
our
intertwined
arms
in
front
of
the
man
at
the
wheel
as
he
stooped
to
raise
it
and
hand
it
to
her
with
a
seaman
bow
his
ready
politeness
unusual
for
one
in
his
station
determined
us
to
cultivate
his
maritime
acquaintance
and
in
a
short
time
we
had
drawn
forth
the
outlines
of
his
story
simple
and
bare
as
this
was
of
incident
his
picturesque
appearance
had
impressed
us
equally
during
the
day
but
until
now
we
had
not
met
in
concert
about
christian
garth
for
such
we
soon
found
was
the
name
of
our
polite
pilot
he
was
a
jerseyman
he
told
us
of
german
descent
married
to
the
girl
of
his
heart
and
living
on
the
coast
of
that
adventurous
little
state
famous
alike
for
its
peaches
and
wrecks
sall
had
a
stocking
full
of
money
he
informed
us
silver
and
copper
and
gold
when
he
married
her
for
her
mother
had
been
a
famous
huckster
and
never
missed
her
post
in
the
philadelphia
market
for
thirty
years
and
this
was
her
child
inheritance
and
with
this
money
he
had
fixed
up
his
old
hut
till
it
looked
inside
like
a
cabin
and
now
sall
wanted
him
to
stay
at
home
he
informed
us
with
her
and
the
children
but
somehow
or
other
he
could
never
tarry
long
at
the
hearth
for
the
sea
pulled
him
like
it
was
his
mother
and
the
spell
of
the
tides
was
on
him
and
he
must
foller
even
if
he
went
to
his
own
destruction
like
them
men
that
liquor
lures
to
loss
or
the
love
of
mermaids
all
land
service
is
dead
when
likened
to
the
sea
he
said
shaking
his
great
head
and
looking
out
lovingly
upon
his
idol
but
ships
like
they
oncst
was
ladies
he
added
before
men
put
these
here
heavy
iron
ingines
to
work
in
it
like
cropping
a
bird
wing
to
make
a
of
a
ship
and
a
burning
shame
to
shorten
sails
till
it
looks
like
a
young
gal
dressed
in
breeches
or
any
other
onnatural
thing
for
a
and
a
petticoat
always
rise
up
in
a
true
man
mind
together
god
bless
them
both
i
say
to
which
we
cordially
say
amen
of
course
said
miss
lamarque
laughing
we
should
have
been
at
a
loss
however
garth
but
for
our
engine
during
the
dead
calm
preceding
the
storm
when
our
sails
flapped
so
lazily
about
her
masts
and
she
rocked
like
a
cradle
without
making
progress
it
is
well
the
engineer
manoeuvred
so
successfully
while
we
lay
fireless
on
the
low
rolling
waves
but
we
are
speeding
along
merrily
enough
now
to
make
up
for
it
all
i
take
comfort
in
that
but
not
exactly
in
the
right
direction
though
to
suit
my
stripe
he
said
turning
his
quid
in
his
mouth
us
he
looked
out
to
leeward
revealing
as
he
did
so
a
fine
yet
rugged
profile
relieved
against
the
silvery
purple
sheen
of
the
moonlit
sky
do
you
see
that
dark
object
lying
beyond
our
eyes
mechanically
followed
his
so
still
on
the
water
and
he
indicated
it
with
the
pipe
he
held
in
one
sinewy
hand
for
the
native
courtesy
of
the
man
had
involuntarily
proffered
us
the
homage
of
removing
it
from
his
lips
when
we
addressed
him
yes
what
is
it
a
wreck
a
whale
a
small
volcanic
island
do
explain
garth
said
miss
lamarque
nothing
but
an
iceberg
and
we
are
bearing
down
upon
it
rather
too
rapidly
it
seems
to
me
and
so
speaking
he
turned
his
wheel
in
silence
warily
but
you
have
the
command
of
the
helm
and
have
nothing
to
do
but
obey
orders
he
interrupted
grimly
ef
the
captain
was
to
tell
me
to
run
the
ship
to
purgatory
i
have
to
do
it
you
know
but
surely
the
captain
would
not
jeopardize
the
lives
of
a
company
even
if
he
likes
warm
latitudes
by
ordering
you
to
run
foul
of
an
iceberg
and
if
he
did
you
certainly
would
not
dare
to
obey
him
with
the
fear
of
god
before
your
eyes
remonstrated
miss
lamarque
indignantly
for
my
part
i
shall
go
to
him
immediately
and
desire
him
to
change
his
course
but
after
all
i
do
believe
that
dingy
black
thing
is
an
iceberg
at
all
an
old
rather
thrown
over
from
some
or
a
vast
lump
of
charred
wood
you
are
only
trying
to
alarm
us
ef
you
was
to
see
it
close
enough
you
would
find
it
to
shine
equal
to
the
diamond
on
your
hand
but
i
hope
you
never
will
that
all
i
hope
you
never
will
lady
i
sot
on
a
peak
of
that
sort
oncst
myself
for
three
days
in
higher
latitudes
than
this
here
me
and
five
others
all
that
was
spared
from
the
wreck
of
the
schooner
delta
and
we
felt
our
convoy
melting
away
beneath
us
and
courtesying
even
with
the
sea
before
the
osprey
took
us
off
half
starved
and
half
frozen
and
half
roasted
all
at
oncst
them
is
onpleasant
rickollections
ladies
and
it
makes
my
blood
creep
to
this
day
to
see
an
iceberg
in
konsikence
but
a
man
must
do
his
dooty
whatsomever
do
betide
it
was
in
the
dead
of
night
and
hans
schuyler
had
the
wheel
i
remember
when
we
went
to
pieces
on
that
iceberg
all
for
disregarding
the
captain
orders
you
see
he
meant
to
graze
it
like
graze
it
almost
shrieked
miss
lamarque
did
he
think
he
was
driving
a
curricle
graze
it
heaven
what
rashness
do
do
garth
i
petitioned
i
shall
never
sleep
a
wink
on
this
ship
if
you
continue
your
narrative
do
do
garth
entreated
miss
lamarque
whose
penetration
showed
her
by
this
time
that
the
pilot
was
only
playing
on
our
fears
for
want
of
a
better
instrument
for
his
skill
i
quite
enjoy
the
idea
that
you
have
actually
been
astride
a
fragment
of
the
arctic
glacier
and
that
we
may
perhaps
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
white
bear
ourselves
when
we
get
near
our
iceberg
or
a
gentle
seal
would
you
like
one
for
a
pet
miss
harz
it
is
very
cold
i
said
digressively
i
feel
the
chill
of
that
fragment
of
greenland
freeze
my
marrow
i
must
go
fetch
my
shawl
but
first
reassure
us
garth
if
possible
he
laughed
i
have
paid
you
now
for
making
fun
of
me
he
said
saucily
i
saw
your
drawing
of
me
in
your
books
and
heard
the
ladies
laughing
i
peeped
as
i
passed
when
myers
took
the
helm
and
i
wanted
to
see
what
all
the
fun
was
about
then
i
said
to
myself
will
give
her
a
skeer
for
that
if
i
have
a
chance
but
all
the
same
the
chill
you
feel
is
a
real
one
for
as
sure
as
death
that
lump
of
darkness
is
an
iceberg
i
have
told
you
no
yarn
as
you
will
find
out
when
you
ask
the
captain
i
steer
you
clear
of
the
iceberg
though
ladies
never
fear
hans
schuyler
has
not
got
the
wheel
you
see
he
was
three
sheets
in
the
wind
anyhow
and
the
captain
says
says
he
tech
another
drop
this
night
or
we
never
see
another
till
we
are
resurrected
and
so
he
turned
into
his
hammock
and
swung
himself
to
sleep
a
way
he
had
for
he
did
keer
for
nothin
where
his
comfort
was
concerned
having
been
raised
up
in
the
injies
come
miss
lamarque
i
interrupted
i
must
not
hear
another
word
doth
murder
sleep
and
i
shall
be
nervous
for
a
month
after
this
so
garth
and
be
sure
you
merit
your
first
name
by
taking
good
care
of
us
while
we
imitate
the
example
of
your
worthy
captain
and
ourselves
to
sleep
or
rather
let
the
waves
perform
that
office
for
us
i
shall
make
it
my
care
morning
early
if
you
still
hold
the
helm
to
show
you
my
sketch
and
convince
you
that
it
was
never
made
for
fun
at
all
but
that
it
is
a
real
portrait
of
a
very
seaman
a
real
viking
in
appearance
and
somewhat
better
than
one
at
heart
i
trust
i
shall
hope
to
earn
your
good
opinion
instead
of
when
you
have
only
seen
my
sketch
you
have
it
already
you
have
it
already
young
gal
young
miss
i
mean
he
said
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
which
meant
to
be
courteous
no
doubt
but
seemed
only
defiant
an
this
much
i
kin
say
without
injury
to
sall
that
i
rather
hear
you
talk
and
see
you
smile
as
i
has
been
watchin
of
you
constant
do
than
go
to
the
circus
in
new
york
or
even
to
a
spanish
or
hear
a
oration
or
and
that
saying
no
little
an
no
iceberg
shall
come
near
you
while
christian
garth
lays
a
hand
upon
this
helm
but
do
be
skeered
ladies
no
harm
will
come
to
the
good
ship
kosciusko
i
declare
our
pilot
is
quite
chivalrous
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
for
i
marked
his
glance
miss
harz
said
miss
lamarque
archly
as
we
turned
our
faces
cabinward
under
the
protection
of
our
promised
vigilance
see
what
it
is
to
be
young
and
pretty
and
remark
the
truth
of
the
old
proverb
as
exemplified
in
his
case
that
meet
victoria
herself
is
not
more
independent
of
me
or
my
position
established
facts
as
both
are
in
the
eyes
of
some
than
is
christian
garth
to
him
this
outsider
of
the
world
of
fashion
i
am
only
a
homely
old
woman
no
prestige
comes
in
to
garnish
the
unvarnished
fact
a
plain
old
maid
my
dear
with
not
even
the
remembrance
of
beauty
as
a
consolation
nor
its
remnant
as
a
sign
of
past
triumphs
this
and
nothing
more
as
that
wonderful
man
poe
makes
his
raven
say
we
never
find
our
level
until
we
go
among
people
who
know
and
care
nothing
about
us
who
have
never
of
us
that
exordium
of
most
greetings
from
folks
of
our
own
class
it
is
absolutely
refreshing
to
be
so
unaffectedly
despised
and
slighted
it
does
one
a
world
of
good
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
especially
when
one
grandfather
was
a
revolutionary
notability
and
other
antecedents
of
a
piece
but
men
are
all
alike
at
heart
only
the
worldly
ones
wear
flimsy
masks
you
know
and
pretend
to
adore
intellect
and
ugliness
when
beauty
is
the
only
thing
they
care
for
all
a
sham
my
dear
in
any
case
yes
all
alike
i
repeated
making
as
i
spoke
one
mental
entire
reservation
all
alike
i
mean
flatter
their
vanity
ever
so
little
and
they
are
at
your
very
feet
asking
more
like
oliver
twist
more
bread
for
the
insatiable
it
was
that
sketch
of
mine
that
wrought
the
spell
though
unintentionally
of
course
and
the
sly
fellow
knew
very
well
that
it
was
no
caricature
that
is
if
he
peeped
as
he
pretends
but
a
tolerably
correct
likeness
that
might
have
satisfied
sall
herself
i
have
a
great
mind
to
bestow
it
upon
him
as
a
for
cerberus
should
her
jealousy
ever
be
aroused
by
your
reports
of
his
devotion
to
me
or
admiration
rather
most
unequivocally
avowed
it
must
be
acknowledged
i
really
had
no
intention
of
injuring
sally
and
if
you
think
it
best
will
make
the
by
being
as
cross
as
possible
to
him
no
no
carry
out
your
first
intention
and
conciliate
him
for
remember
he
has
us
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
bestow
the
picture
by
all
means
and
just
as
many
smiles
and
compliments
as
he
can
stand
or
you
can
afford
to
squander
for
you
are
worse
than
a
mermaid
miss
harz
for
fascination
all
the
gentlemen
say
so
and
as
to
captain
falconer
they
are
malignants
i
rejoined
ignoring
purposely
the
last
clause
of
the
sentence
which
i
had
interrupted
and
you
are
perfidious
to
hear
them
slander
me
so
i
hate
fascinating
people
they
always
make
my
flesh
crawl
like
serpents
the
few
i
have
known
have
been
so
very
base
good
specimens
of
bass
she
interpolated
i
am
sure
i
am
glad
i
have
no
attributes
of
fascination
if
a
strange
old
work
i
met
with
at
beauseincourt
may
be
considered
responsible
did
you
ever
see
it
miss
lamarque
you
who
see
every
thing
hieronymus
frascatorius
tells
of
certain
families
in
crete
who
fascinated
by
praising
and
to
avert
this
evil
influence
some
charm
was
used
consisting
of
a
magic
word
i
suppose
this
was
typical
of
humility
though
related
as
literal
this
on
the
part
of
the
old
chronicler
was
simply
as
major
favraud
would
say
with
his
characteristic
shrug
one
related
you
see
my
theme
has
full
possession
of
me
and
the
book
is
a
collation
of
facts
on
the
subject
of
fascination
of
all
kinds
even
down
to
that
of
the
serpent
that
a
friend
of
his
saw
a
fascinator
with
a
look
break
in
two
a
precious
gem
in
the
hands
of
a
lapidary
typical
this
i
suppose
of
some
fond
foolish
female
heart
fire
according
to
this
author
represents
the
quality
of
fascination
and
toads
and
moths
are
subject
to
its
influence
as
well
as
some
higher
animals
deer
for
instance
who
are
hunted
successfully
with
torches
and
he
relates
further
that
in
abyssinia
artificers
of
pottery
and
iron
are
thus
fearfully
endowed
and
are
consequently
forbidden
to
join
in
the
sacred
rites
of
religion
as
fire
is
their
chief
agent
this
a
strange
quaint
volume
to
set
before
a
king
and
how
do
you
like
my
lecture
delivered
oh
vastly
but
i
did
not
know
that
was
your
style
before
cultivate
it
dear
if
you
hope
to
win
manly
hearts
men
like
to
do
all
the
lecturing
themselves
and
i
find
it
diplomatic
to
feign
profound
ignorance
on
all
subjects
outside
of
a
bandbox
it
delights
them
so
to
enlighten
us
no
wonder
they
fancy
us
fools
when
we
feign
foolishness
so
admirably
lapwings
that
we
are
but
i
never
do
in
such
society
my
experience
is
different
from
yours
i
always
pretend
to
know
twice
as
much
as
i
do
when
they
are
about
it
bluffs
them
off
and
they
are
credulous
sometimes
as
well
as
ignorant
notwithstanding
their
boasted
acumen
your
lamp
of
experience
needs
trimming
my
pretty
miriam
she
said
shaking
her
head
if
you
really
believe
this
they
never
forgive
superiority
assumed
or
real
none
but
the
noble
ones
i
mean
who
of
course
are
in
the
minority
give
a
pair
of
tongs
pantaloons
and
it
asserts
itself
trousers
my
dear
are
at
the
root
of
manly
presumption
i
discovered
that
long
ago
a
man
in
petticoats
would
be
as
humble
as
a
woman
this
is
my
theory
at
least
take
it
for
what
it
is
worth
and
now
to
sleep
with
what
heart
we
may
an
iceberg
being
in
our
vicinity
and
taking
my
face
in
her
hand
she
kissed
me
cordially
it
is
very
early
in
our
acquaintance
for
such
manifestations
to
be
allowable
she
said
kindly
but
i
am
a
sort
of
spoiled
child
of
society
and
dare
to
be
natural
i
consider
that
the
best
privilege
that
attaches
to
my
condition
that
of
the
of
savannah
the
bore
you
know
favraud
has
told
you
of
course
he
always
characterizes
as
he
goes
he
has
called
you
the
most
agreeable
woman
in
savannah
i
remember
young
or
old
and
was
truly
glad
on
my
account
to
know
that
you
were
on
board
of
your
brother
he
spoke
very
kindly
also
even
admiringly
oh
yea
i
know
but
of
raguet
there
is
little
question
now
his
death
has
crushed
him
i
never
saw
so
changed
a
man
he
is
half
idiotic
i
believe
and
i
am
with
him
now
just
to
keep
those
children
from
completing
the
work
of
destruction
six
little
motherless
ones
only
think
and
as
bad
as
they
can
possibly
be
for
poor
lucilla
was
no
manager
is
it
strange
the
influence
those
little
cottony
women
get
over
their
husbands
you
and
i
might
try
forever
to
establish
such
absolute
despotism
all
in
vain
it
is
your
whimpering
sort
that
rule
with
the
waving
of
a
but
poor
dear
little
woman
she
is
powerless
now
and
i
suppose
the
next
will
be
like
unto
her
raguet
would
never
look
at
any
thing
feminine
that
had
white
eyes
and
pink
hair
yellow
i
mean
of
course
his
style
you
know
being
dark
and
stern
he
likes
the
downy
waxy
kind
all
this
is
shockingly
egotistical
but
the
question
is
who
that
has
a
spark
of
individuality
is
otherwise
again
and
may
all
sweet
dreams
attend
you
for
my
part
i
never
dream
being
past
the
dreaming
age
and
realities
fortunately
disappear
with
daylight
even
cross
children
are
wheedled
into
quietness
and
servants
forget
to
fidget
and
giggle
and
for
mosquitoes
there
are
bars
adieu
and
thus
we
parted
never
to
meet
again
in
mutual
mood
like
this
yet
had
the
free
agency
of
which
some
men
boast
been
ours
we
had
scarcely
chosen
to
face
the
awful
change
to
look
into
each
other
eyes
through
gathering
chapter
iii
before
my
dreaming
eyes
was
the
terror
of
a
hungry
crunching
tooth
fixed
in
the
vessel
side
that
of
the
iceberg
lying
black
in
the
moonlight
like
a
great
coal
crystal
grimly
awaiting
our
approach
but
the
reality
as
well
as
the
figment
had
disappeared
when
i
emerged
at
sunrise
from
the
suffocating
cabin
to
the
atmosphere
of
the
cool
and
quiet
which
had
just
undergone
its
matutinal
armed
with
an
orange
and
a
biscuit
for
physical
refreshment
i
depended
on
sea
and
sky
for
my
mental
entertainment
and
in
my
hand
i
bore
a
slender
scroll
destined
as
a
propitiatory
offering
to
our
offended
helmsman
i
was
glad
to
find
again
at
the
wheel
our
pilot
of
yesterday
your
iceberg
has
disappeared
garth
i
said
as
i
extended
to
him
the
sketch
i
had
made
of
his
noble
the
day
before
and
here
is
a
picture
for
your
wife
which
she
will
see
was
not
drawn
for
fun
women
are
sharper
than
men
about
such
matters
there
i
bestow
it
not
without
regret
he
received
my
offering
with
a
smile
and
nod
of
his
great
curly
head
opened
it
gazed
long
and
seriously
upon
it
and
with
the
single
word
good
rolled
it
up
again
and
consigned
it
to
some
bosom
pocket
in
his
flannel
shirt
into
which
it
seemed
to
glide
as
a
telescope
into
its
case
revealing
as
he
did
so
glimpses
of
a
hairy
breast
and
vigorous
chest
more
admirable
for
strength
than
beauty
certainly
i
will
keep
it
there
he
said
young
miss
pressing
it
closely
against
his
side
with
his
colossal
hand
until
i
get
safe
home
to
the
jarseys
and
to
sall
or
go
to
davy
locker
one
or
other
but
which
it
will
be
young
gal
young
miss
i
should
be
saying
is
not
for
me
to
know
nor
for
anyone
i
rejoined
solemnly
all
rests
with
god
with
god
and
our
engineer
he
resumed
tersely
them
sails
is
of
little
account
now
the
mainmast
is
struck
away
them
floppen
petticoats
wat
the
wind
loves
to
play
in
and
out
layin
along
like
a
lazy
lubber
that
it
is
and
leaving
its
work
for
others
to
do
it
was
a
noble
mast
though
while
it
stood
and
you
could
smell
the
turpentine
blood
in
its
heart
to
the
very
last
it
was
as
limber
as
a
sapling
and
never
growed
brittle
like
some
wood
with
age
and
dryness
no
storm
could
splinter
it
and
it
would
fling
itself
over
into
the
high
waves
sometimes
rayther
than
snap
and
lash
them
like
a
whip
but
there
it
lies
burned
with
the
fire
of
heaven
wrath
at
last
and
leaving
its
fires
of
hell
behind
in
the
heart
of
the
kosciusko
you
have
changed
your
mind
on
the
subject
of
engines
garth
i
am
glad
to
see
truly
ours
seems
to
be
doing
giant
work
now
we
are
flying
to
be
sure
rushing
not
flying
young
lady
that
the
word
our
wings
are
little
use
you
see
such
as
are
left
to
us
runnin
for
dear
life
better
say
for
that
the
truth
of
the
matter
and
may
the
merciful
lord
speed
us
and
have
in
his
care
all
helpless
ones
this
day
the
lifted
hand
the
bared
head
the
earnest
accents
with
which
these
words
were
spoken
gave
to
this
simple
utterance
of
all
the
solemnity
of
a
benediction
or
prayer
i
noticed
that
after
replacing
his
tarpaulin
the
lips
of
garth
continued
to
move
silently
then
were
compressed
gravely
for
a
time
while
his
eye
large
clear
and
expressive
was
fixed
on
space
do
you
still
see
an
iceberg
garth
do
you
really
apprehend
danger
for
us
now
i
asked
after
studying
his
countenance
for
a
moment
or
are
you
again
desirous
to
try
the
nerves
of
your
female
passengers
i
think
i
must
apply
to
the
captain
this
time
for
information
yes
danger
he
replied
in
low
sad
tones
ignoring
my
last
remark
or
perhaps
not
hearing
it
at
all
danger
compared
with
which
an
iceberg
might
be
considered
in
the
light
of
a
heavenly
marcy
there
is
a
chance
of
grazing
one
of
them
or
of
its
drifting
away
from
a
ship
when
the
ripples
reach
it
or
if
the
wust
comes
a
body
can
scramble
overboard
and
manage
to
live
on
the
top
of
one
of
them
peaks
or
in
one
of
their
with
a
few
blankets
and
a
little
bread
and
junk
and
water
fur
a
space
so
as
to
get
a
chance
of
a
ship
or
a
schooner
but
when
there
is
something
wrong
in
a
heart
there
much
hope
for
rescue
onless
it
comes
from
above
he
hesitated
smiling
grimly
rolled
his
quid
crammed
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
and
again
addressed
himself
to
his
wheel
and
for
a
few
moments
i
stood
beside
him
silently
the
ship
is
leaking
i
suppose
i
said
at
last
so
that
you
apprehend
her
loss
perhaps
and
my
heart
sank
coldly
within
me
as
i
spoke
but
if
this
be
true
why
does
not
the
captain
apprise
us
no
you
are
quizzing
me
again
and
very
cruelly
this
time
very
unwarrantably
yet
i
did
not
think
exactly
as
i
spoke
strive
as
i
might
to
believe
the
man
in
jest
too
much
solemnity
and
sorrow
both
were
discernible
in
his
worn
and
rugged
features
hewn
grandly
as
if
from
granite
to
admit
of
a
hope
like
this
his
words
were
earnest
and
some
great
calamity
was
in
store
i
could
not
doubt
or
at
least
he
apprehended
such
for
some
time
he
replied
not
then
slowing
pointing
to
the
base
of
the
stricken
mainmast
which
still
showed
an
elevation
of
some
inches
above
the
deck
he
revealed
to
me
the
truth
without
a
word
as
my
eyes
followed
his
guiding
finger
i
saw
with
terror
unspeakable
a
thin
blue
wavering
float
upward
from
the
floor
and
after
curling
feebly
about
the
truncated
mast
disappear
in
the
clear
sunlit
atmosphere
again
to
arise
from
the
same
point
that
of
the
juncture
of
the
mast
and
deck
creeping
through
some
invisible
crevice
as
it
seemed
to
form
itself
eternally
in
filmy
folds
and
successively
elude
the
eye
as
soon
as
it
shaped
to
sight
i
understood
him
then
there
was
fire
in
the
heart
of
the
ship
and
i
knew
the
hold
was
filled
with
cotton
it
was
smouldering
slowly
and
our
safety
was
a
question
of
time
alone
pale
transfixed
frozen
i
lifted
my
eyes
to
the
man
who
seemed
to
represent
my
fate
for
the
moment
was
it
the
lightning
i
asked
after
a
pause
during
which
his
pitying
eye
rested
on
me
drearily
did
the
fire
occur
in
that
way
yes
the
lightning
it
was
and
god
hand
which
sent
the
shaft
direct
alone
can
deliver
us
i
seemed
to
hear
the
voice
of
bertie
speak
these
words
things
grew
confused
i
wavered
as
i
stood
lifted
my
hand
to
my
head
the
face
of
christian
garth
grew
large
and
dim
then
faded
utterly
i
knew
no
more
until
i
found
myself
seated
on
a
coil
of
rope
leaning
against
the
bulwark
while
a
young
girl
stood
beside
me
fanning
and
bathing
my
face
and
offering
me
a
glass
of
water
you
are
better
now
she
said
kindly
the
man
at
the
wheel
called
me
as
i
was
passing
and
pointed
out
your
condition
and
i
led
you
here
and
ran
for
water
being
up
so
early
is
apt
to
disagree
with
some
people
what
are
these
people
crawling
about
the
deck
for
is
all
hope
over
or
was
it
only
a
dream
i
asked
oh
you
are
quite
wild
yet
from
your
swoon
it
is
only
the
calkers
stopping
up
the
seams
one
of
the
captain
queer
whims
they
say
but
how
they
are
to
dance
those
i
mean
without
ruining
their
slippers
with
this
pitch
i
can
not
see
thank
goodness
i
belong
to
a
church
and
am
not
of
this
party
and
do
care
on
my
own
account
nor
does
the
captain
i
believe
i
was
placed
under
his
care
at
savannah
and
i
suppose
it
is
only
to
stop
the
ball
that
she
was
interrupted
by
the
approach
of
the
officer
under
discussion
but
he
passed
us
gloomily
and
went
on
to
inspect
the
workmen
so
unseasonably
employed
as
it
seemed
in
a
labor
that
save
in
a
case
of
long
voyages
is
always
performed
in
port
his
melancholy
air
and
the
preoccupation
of
his
manner
confirmed
my
worst
fears
again
i
sought
the
ixion
of
the
vessel
who
calmly
and
stolidly
performed
his
duty
as
if
indeed
fate
directed
without
a
change
of
feature
now
or
expression
has
the
captain
no
hope
of
rescue
mr
garth
oh
yes
he
thinks
we
shall
meet
a
ship
or
two
between
now
and
noon
we
always
do
you
know
rolling
his
quid
slowly
and
hesitating
for
a
while
keep
heart
keep
heart
i
had
thought
from
your
face
you
were
stronger
besides
the
pumps
are
doing
good
work
in
the
hold
who
knows
what
may
come
of
it
who
knows
alas
alas
i
could
not
rise
to
the
level
of
this
dim
hope
think
of
the
burning
crowd
the
sheet
of
flame
the
terrible
destruction
i
murmured
i
must
go
now
and
apprise
those
poor
wretches
below
that
their
time
is
short
they
have
a
right
to
know
his
hand
was
on
my
arm
you
do
not
go
a
step
on
such
an
errand
he
muttered
it
is
the
captain
business
he
will
to
it
when
the
time
comes
for
he
is
a
true
man
and
the
bravest
sailor
on
the
line
he
means
to
do
what
right
never
fear
it
is
my
dooty
to
hold
you
here
until
he
comes
onless
you
promise
me
to
be
discreet
i
shall
be
discreet
never
fear
and
his
grasp
relaxed
i
sped
me
back
to
the
coil
of
rope
on
which
i
had
left
my
young
companion
intending
to
partake
with
her
there
my
biscuit
and
orange
so
needed
now
for
strength
i
found
in
her
stead
for
she
had
departed
in
the
interval
a
young
woman
plain
and
poor
a
widow
evidently
from
the
style
of
her
shabby
mourning
and
sad
expression
of
face
bearing
in
her
arms
a
weird
and
child
evidently
a
sufferer
from
spinal
disease
an
infant
as
to
size
but
preternaturally
old
in
countenance
the
steady
gaze
of
its
large
and
serious
eyes
affected
me
magnetically
eyes
that
seemed
ever
seeking
something
that
still
eluded
them
and
which
now
appeared
to
inquire
into
my
very
soul
is
your
little
boy
ill
madam
i
asked
at
last
and
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
a
smile
broke
over
his
small
sallow
features
lending
them
strange
beauty
but
dying
away
instantly
again
into
an
expression
of
startled
suspicion
yes
very
ill
she
answered
clasping
him
tenderly
as
he
clung
to
her
suddenly
he
has
some
settled
trouble
that
no
medicine
reaches
and
you
see
how
small
and
light
he
is
many
a
twelve
months
babe
is
heavier
than
he
yet
he
is
three
years
old
come
march
next
and
he
is
beyond
his
years
it
seems
to
me
you
seem
very
weak
and
weary
i
rejoined
i
noticed
you
yesterday
with
interest
sitting
all
the
time
with
your
boy
on
your
knee
you
must
need
exercise
and
rest
go
and
walk
now
a
little
while
you
can
and
i
stretched
my
arms
for
her
baby
to
her
surprise
evidently
he
came
to
me
willingly
attracted
no
doubt
by
the
gleam
of
the
about
my
neck
and
still
further
propitiated
by
a
portion
of
my
orange
which
he
greedily
devoured
in
the
mean
time
the
poor
pale
mother
took
a
few
turns
on
the
and
disappearing
therefrom
a
moment
returned
with
a
small
supply
of
cakes
and
biscuits
which
she
had
sought
in
the
room
an
inspiration
of
providence
no
doubt
she
thought
this
proceeding
later
which
at
the
moment
was
only
intended
to
anticipate
the
delay
attendant
on
all
meals
these
cakes
with
a
diligence
if
not
forethought
peculiar
to
all
feeble
animals
squirrels
sick
children
and
the
like
did
he
one
by
one
cram
and
compel
into
my
pocket
unconscious
as
i
was
at
the
moment
of
his
proceeding
instinctive
probably
which
later
i
detected
to
his
infinite
rejoicing
in
company
with
my
slender
purse
and
bunch
of
useless
keys
a
pencil
and
a
small
they
remained
until
that
moment
of
accidental
discovery
arrived
which
was
to
test
their
value
and
place
it
far
above
that
of
rubies
light
as
a
pithless
nut
seemed
this
little
creature
in
my
strong
energetic
arms
and
yet
his
mother
staggered
beneath
his
weight
she
insisted
however
after
a
time
on
resuming
her
charge
of
him
as
it
was
proper
she
should
do
and
then
sat
beside
me
delivering
herself
of
a
long
string
of
complaints
and
grievances
after
the
fashion
of
all
solitary
people
when
secure
of
sympathy
she
overrated
my
benevolence
on
this
occasion
however
i
was
lost
in
painful
reverie
and
scarcely
understood
a
word
of
her
communication
which
i
was
obliged
at
last
to
cut
short
for
i
had
resolved
now
that
my
strength
was
recruited
on
the
only
visible
course
remaining
to
me
i
would
seek
miss
lamarque
confide
to
her
the
statement
of
christian
garth
relate
to
her
what
my
eyes
had
seen
and
be
guided
by
her
determination
and
judgment
with
those
of
her
brother
a
man
of
sense
i
saw
and
whose
instincts
no
doubt
would
all
be
sharpened
by
the
jeopardy
of
his
children
she
was
sitting
up
in
her
when
i
knocked
at
the
door
still
in
her
berth
the
lower
one
from
which
the
upper
shelf
had
been
lifted
so
as
to
afford
her
room
and
air
looking
very
oriental
and
handsomer
than
i
ever
had
seen
her
in
her
bright
madras
and
fine
white
cambric
wrapper
richly
trimmed
her
face
broke
into
smiles
as
soon
as
she
beheld
me
and
she
invited
me
in
a
way
not
to
be
resisted
so
resolute
and
yet
so
kindly
was
it
to
partake
with
her
of
the
hot
coffee
her
maid
was
just
handing
her
in
bed
in
a
small
gilded
cup
a
portion
of
the
service
on
the
stand
beside
her
it
is
our
southern
custom
you
know
miss
harz
always
our
before
breakfast
as
a
safeguard
against
malaria
to
be
sure
there
is
nothing
of
that
sort
to
be
apprehended
at
sea
but
still
habits
are
inveterate
second
nature
as
the
moralists
and
say
as
if
there
ever
could
be
more
than
one
what
nonsense
these
wiseacres
talk
to
be
sure
but
there
is
cream
you
see
for
those
who
like
it
boiled
down
and
bottled
for
the
use
of
the
children
before
leaving
home
one
of
dominica
notions
and
here
the
smiling
maid
with
her
little
respectful
courtesy
tendered
me
a
reviving
cup
of
miss
morning
beverage
mocha
made
to
the
last
point
of
perfection
dripped
and
filtered
over
a
by
dominica
the
skillful
and
but
you
are
very
pale
my
child
what
on
earth
can
be
the
matter
there
dominica
i
thought
i
heard
florry
cry
go
and
help
caliste
get
the
children
ready
for
a
trot
upon
deck
before
breakfast
and
do
forget
to
give
each
one
a
gill
of
cream
and
a
biscuit
or
stay
twice
as
much
for
the
two
elder
before
they
go
up
it
may
be
some
time
before
they
get
their
regular
morning
they
have
to
wait
you
know
miss
harz
which
is
such
rank
injustice
where
children
are
concerned
patience
never
belongs
to
unreasoning
creatures
unless
an
instinct
as
with
animals
men
have
to
learn
its
lessons
through
the
teachings
of
experience
that
strictest
of
now
you
see
i
have
my
on
and
am
almost
equal
to
you
or
lardner
in
my
way
but
it
takes
you
to
define
fascination
i
suppose
heavyside
however
could
help
you
there
for
nothing
short
of
witchcraft
could
account
to
me
for
her
elopement
with
that
dreary
man
to
leave
her
sweet
children
too
as
if
all
the
men
on
earth
could
be
worth
to
a
true
mother
her
teething
baby
little
toe
or
finger
would
she
never
stop
never
give
one
for
doubt
to
enter
i
thought
but
what
in
the
world
ails
you
has
dunmore
the
disconsolate
been
making
love
again
has
captain
falconer
declared
himself
too
soon
and
do
you
hesitate
on
account
of
miss
moore
do
let
that
consideration
influence
you
i
beg
for
she
is
the
greatest
flirt
in
savannah
the
truest
to
the
vocation
and
i
like
her
for
that
anyhow
whatever
a
man
or
woman
has
to
do
let
him
or
her
do
earnestly
that
is
exactly
scripture
but
near
enough
do
you
think
so
and
she
laughed
merrily
i
have
been
on
deck
this
morning
i
commenced
miss
lamarque
and
saw
christian
garth
and
he
has
been
terrifying
and
electrifying
you
again
with
his
tale
of
horrors
there
it
is
all
out
why
he
is
as
sensational
as
eyre
this
new
english
novel
i
am
just
reading
drawing
it
from
under
her
pillow
and
holding
it
aloft
as
she
spoke
currer
bell
is
not
more
mysteriously
awful
but
garth
is
not
artistic
i
detected
his
intention
by
the
inconsistency
of
his
expression
of
face
which
bore
no
part
in
his
narrative
and
at
once
exposed
him
you
must
remember
oh
yes
but
this
time
nonsense
miriam
harz
the
iceberg
is
gone
i
know
why
what
a
nervous
coward
you
are
to
be
sure
with
all
that
assumed
bravery
i
am
twice
as
courageous
i
do
believe
despite
appearances
i
really
begin
to
be
of
opinion
that
it
is
safer
to
be
at
sea
than
on
land
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
heterodoxy
a
second
cup
why
of
course
and
a
third
if
you
want
it
i
am
delighted
you
like
it
these
little
sÃ¨vres
toys
are
but
thimbles
but
i
always
carry
them
about
with
me
by
sea
and
land
and
have
for
years
i
feel
as
if
there
were
luck
in
them
not
one
of
the
original
three
has
been
broken
there
there
just
as
i
was
boasting
too
never
mind
such
accidents
occur
but
your
pretty
pongee
dress
is
sadly
stained
with
the
coffee
besides
as
dropped
the
cup
it
is
luck
not
mine
and
i
want
an
odd
saucer
anyhow
to
feed
desirÃ©e
out
of
she
sleeps
in
that
willow
basket
you
see
in
the
corner
of
the
miss
harz
and
is
lazy
like
her
mistress
of
desirÃ©e
desirÃ©e
peep
out
ca
you
now
you
have
your
sÃ¨vres
saucer
to
lap
milk
from
she
wo
touch
delft
miss
harz
she
is
the
most
fastidious
little
creature
alas
alas
and
i
groaned
aloud
not
taking
on
about
that
silly
cup
i
hope
no
what
can
it
be
then
a
megrim
no
well
i
ca
imagine
any
thing
worse
to
save
my
life
here
let
me
read
you
this
it
is
fine
it
is
where
jane
eyre
feels
herself
deserted
and
this
comparison
about
channel
of
a
river
thrills
one
just
hear
it
and
she
was
about
commencing
not
now
not
now
miss
lamarque
stern
realities
demand
our
attention
lay
your
book
aside
be
calm
be
firm
but
listen
to
me
seriously
christian
garth
informs
me
nor
he
alone
my
own
eyes
have
done
the
rest
that
the
cotton
in
the
hold
has
taken
fire
from
the
lightning
yesterday
has
been
slowly
smouldering
ever
since
the
mast
was
struck
and
that
the
ship
hours
are
numbered
o
god
o
god
and
she
bowed
her
head
upon
her
clasped
and
quivering
hands
but
captain
ambrose
he
did
not
tell
you
so
looking
up
suddenly
christian
garth
indeed
his
impudence
is
surprising
another
hoax
i
suppose
and
she
tried
to
smile
such
a
coarse
creature
too
we
shall
see
but
for
the
present
say
nothing
only
get
up
and
dress
as
quickly
as
you
can
but
it
is
important
to
be
very
quiet
for
fear
of
causing
confusion
i
have
promised
discretion
call
dominica
then
for
me
miss
harz
gasping
and
stretching
forth
her
arms
i
can
do
nothing
for
myself
nothing
i
am
so
weak
so
helpless
yet
i
must
believe
he
is
you
are
mistaken
i
trust
it
may
prove
so
but
let
me
assist
you
dominica
is
best
employed
making
ready
the
little
ones
and
giving
them
food
strengthening
them
for
the
struggle
she
will
be
nerveless
if
she
knows
the
truth
and
you
are
not
in
a
condition
to
conceal
it
just
as
you
will
then
my
trunk
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
unlock
it
and
give
me
out
the
tray
that
picture
after
that
i
can
get
along
alone
i
silently
did
as
she
desired
and
saw
her
place
a
covered
miniature
about
her
neck
before
she
arose
very
few
minutes
sufficed
this
morning
for
her
toilet
usually
a
tedious
and
fastidious
one
her
dress
her
bonnet
her
shawl
were
hastily
thrown
on
her
watch
secured
with
the
few
jewels
lying
upon
the
the
rest
of
her
valuables
were
with
other
boxes
in
the
hold
the
repository
of
all
unneeded
baggage
and
these
of
course
she
could
scarcely
hope
to
save
in
case
of
fire
even
if
lives
were
rescued
then
together
we
went
out
just
in
time
to
join
the
little
troop
of
young
children
and
nurses
on
their
way
to
the
deck
miss
lamarque
did
not
reply
to
their
tumultuous
greeting
but
silently
taking
the
baby
florry
her
namesake
in
her
arms
kissed
her
many
times
i
had
told
her
while
she
was
dressing
of
the
about
the
base
of
the
broken
mast
and
she
believed
in
the
testimony
my
eyes
had
afforded
me
far
more
than
in
the
reports
of
christian
garth
we
did
not
encounter
lamarque
when
we
first
went
on
deck
he
had
gone
forward
to
smoke
some
one
said
but
captain
ambrose
was
standing
alone
telescope
in
hand
and
to
him
we
addressed
ourselves
quietly
he
seemed
startled
when
i
disclosed
the
result
of
my
observation
for
i
did
not
choose
to
commit
the
pilot
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
deny
the
truth
of
the
condition
of
things
and
conjured
us
both
to
entire
quiet
and
composure
and
if
possible
to
absolute
silence
the
safety
of
five
hundred
people
he
said
depended
on
our
discretion
the
ship
might
not
ignite
for
days
if
at
all
he
thought
so
carefully
had
the
air
been
excluded
from
the
cotton
by
the
process
of
tight
calking
so
as
to
seal
it
almost
hermetically
indeed
the
fire
might
be
wholly
extinguished
by
the
pumps
which
were
constantly
at
work
pouring
streams
of
water
around
and
through
the
hold
and
a
panic
would
be
equal
to
a
fire
in
any
case
such
were
his
calmness
and
apparent
faith
in
his
own
words
that
they
did
much
to
allay
miss
lamarque
fears
my
own
were
little
soothed
i
never
doubted
from
the
beginning
what
the
end
would
be
lamarque
approached
us
while
the
conference
with
the
captain
was
going
on
and
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
the
condition
of
affairs
was
communicated
to
that
gentleman
i
never
saw
a
man
so
crushed
and
calm
at
the
same
time
his
handsome
face
seemed
turned
to
stone
he
scarcely
spoke
at
all
and
made
no
inquiries
i
think
his
mind
like
mine
was
made
up
to
the
worst
yet
he
commanded
himself
so
far
as
to
go
to
the
and
superintend
the
meal
of
his
little
children
about
whom
he
hung
like
a
who
sees
the
shadow
of
a
hawk
above
her
brood
from
that
moment
until
the
of
the
drama
separated
us
two
forever
miss
lamarque
and
i
sat
down
together
on
a
bench
while
the
host
of
hungry
passengers
crowded
down
to
the
cabin
at
the
welcome
summons
of
the
bell
and
i
was
aware
again
of
the
pale
widow
and
her
patient
child
standing
near
me
a
sudden
thought
occurred
to
me
this
woman
more
than
any
one
among
us
needed
the
strengthening
stimulus
of
good
food
and
this
meal
might
be
her
last
on
shipboard
on
earth
perhaps
for
a
dull
low
ominous
sound
began
to
make
itself
heard
to
my
ear
as
soon
as
the
murmur
of
the
crowd
subsided
trust
me
with
your
child
again
while
you
go
down
and
eat
your
breakfast
in
my
place
it
is
a
whim
of
mine
i
have
had
coffee
with
this
lady
in
her
and
shall
not
appear
at
the
table
you
may
bring
me
a
slice
of
bread
if
you
choose
when
you
come
back
and
one
for
baby
do
not
refuse
me
this
favor
much
pleased
at
my
attention
as
i
could
see
she
went
to
the
grand
first
table
with
its
salvers
of
snowy
rolls
and
biscuit
its
delicate
birds
and
fowls
its
fragrant
coffee
and
tea
so
different
from
the
dregs
of
the
humble
board
at
which
her
ticket
alone
entitled
her
to
appear
and
to
save
her
from
possible
humiliation
i
wrote
a
line
to
the
steward
so
she
feasted
no
doubt
in
state
again
i
enacted
the
of
nurse
to
a
creature
that
looked
more
like
a
fairy
changeling
than
a
creation
you
are
a
strange
woman
miriam
harz
at
such
an
hour
as
this
what
matters
the
quality
of
food
said
miss
lamarque
sententiously
after
all
what
can
that
invalid
and
her
child
be
to
you
in
any
case
they
are
essentially
common
and
mean
you
never
saw
them
before
and
may
never
see
them
again
in
view
of
such
a
catastrophe
as
that
before
us
all
distinctions
fade
miss
lamarque
this
is
the
last
meal
any
one
will
take
on
the
ship
kosciusko
she
is
doomed
the
woman
might
as
well
get
strength
for
the
chance
of
saving
herself
and
child
i
doubt
whether
any
second
table
will
be
spread
i
spoke
with
anguish
you
can
not
believe
this
why
after
what
the
captain
said
days
may
go
by
before
any
real
danger
manifests
itself
ships
must
pass
in
the
interval
many
ships
may
pass
within
a
few
hours
ready
for
our
relief
if
needed
and
see
the
smoke
has
ceased
to
curl
about
your
broken
that
shows
convincingly
that
the
fire
is
being
gotten
under
extinguished
probably
oh
no
no
no
not
with
that
low
terrible
roaring
in
the
hold
the
fire
is
gaining
strength
and
our
agony
will
soon
he
over
i
sat
with
clasped
hands
and
bowed
head
before
her
insensible
to
her
words
i
suppose
she
strove
to
strengthen
me
i
think
she
tried
to
soothe
failing
in
both
she
rose
and
went
away
and
in
her
place
came
christian
garth
relieved
from
the
helm
and
stood
a
moment
beside
me
do
be
young
gal
an
wait
for
me
ef
the
lord
lets
me
i
will
save
you
and
the
old
lady
too
that
is
ef
she
is
your
aunt
or
mother
or
near
of
kin
i
shook
my
head
drearily
you
have
no
hope
then
mr
garth
hope
yes
the
best
of
hope
the
christian
hope
god
can
do
any
thing
he
pleases
we
all
know
and
he
may
stretch
forth
his
hand
when
all
seems
dark
but
captain
ambrose
is
not
one
to
run
a
risk
of
that
sort
so
he
has
sent
me
to
work
upon
a
raft
one
of
two
he
is
making
for
the
seamen
if
the
wust
comes
to
the
wust
but
you
see
i
have
been
on
lost
ships
afore
now
an
i
know
there
is
no
larboard
nor
starboard
rules
when
men
are
skeered
so
i
shall
make
my
raft
to
hold
the
womenfolk
for
the
boats
will
be
for
the
sailors
mark
my
word
and
them
that
wise
will
wait
till
the
press
is
over
and
take
the
rafts
there
are
little
children
i
said
six
of
them
belonging
to
that
lady
and
lamarque
do
forget
them
garth
and
the
poor
little
widow
coming
now
to
claim
her
baby
this
miserable
little
creature
i
am
holding
until
she
breakfasts
do
lose
sight
of
these
either
in
the
crowd
if
indeed
we
are
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
your
raft
pray
rayther
that
it
may
float
us
all
to
safety
he
said
sternly
for
your
best
chance
of
being
saved
will
be
on
that
raft
if
matters
go
as
i
think
they
will
trust
me
for
i
will
come
and
he
passed
away
just
before
the
little
widow
came
to
my
side
again
i
came
up
as
soon
as
i
could
to
relieve
you
i
know
how
cross
baby
is
when
he
gets
restless
and
i
was
afraid
you
might
tire
of
him
see
i
have
brought
his
bread
and
this
waiter
of
tea
and
toast
for
you
now
you
must
take
a
mouthful
she
knew
nothing
of
our
danger
it
was
plain
did
you
leave
the
other
passengers
at
table
i
asked
the
captain
was
he
there
the
question
was
never
answered
for
the
attention
of
my
interlocutor
was
riveted
now
as
was
my
own
on
the
from
which
a
wild
and
crowd
was
densely
emerging
with
a
confused
hum
of
voices
that
announced
their
recognition
of
their
impending
danger
the
change
of
age
of
pain
of
woe
seemed
sealed
upon
each
aspect
as
one
by
one
and
in
rapid
succession
those
who
had
so
lately
gone
down
to
feast
returned
to
the
upper
day
like
grim
ghosts
coming
from
a
carnival
it
was
a
sight
to
stir
the
stoutest
spirit
at
the
close
of
the
repast
the
captain
had
announced
the
truth
to
his
passengers
and
followed
them
now
to
enjoin
them
to
firmness
and
efficiency
both
so
greatly
needed
at
this
crisis
mounted
on
the
capstan
he
addressed
them
briefly
and
not
without
influence
such
was
the
power
of
his
simple
and
manly
bearing
over
these
distracted
souls
that
even
the
wildest
listened
with
decorum
this
was
no
loaded
with
stolid
or
desperate
men
insensible
of
high
teachings
and
alone
desirous
of
personal
safety
yet
the
universal
instinct
asserted
itself
and
for
the
time
courtesies
were
set
aside
and
family
affections
were
all
that
were
regarded
miss
lamarque
pale
yet
collected
now
stood
surrounded
by
the
children
of
her
brother
leaning
upon
his
arm
while
the
captain
spoke
husbands
and
wives
were
together
sisters
and
brothers
servants
and
their
masters
each
group
revealed
its
several
household
affinities
we
only
were
alone
the
dreary
little
widow
whose
name
i
never
knew
and
miriam
monfort
and
on
natural
principles
we
clung
together
it
is
true
that
miss
lamarque
by
many
signs
implored
me
to
come
to
her
but
i
would
not
it
was
like
intruding
on
a
bed
of
death
i
felt
to
break
through
ties
of
blood
at
such
a
time
by
thrusting
a
foreign
presence
amid
devoted
relatives
and
i
was
too
proud
or
perhaps
too
selfish
to
intrude
where
i
must
be
secondary
unless
i
took
away
another
rights
the
captain
had
promised
in
his
brief
address
to
protect
his
passengers
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
leaving
the
result
with
god
he
had
entreated
them
to
be
calm
and
to
preserve
order
so
essential
to
safety
had
mentioned
his
confidence
that
a
ship
must
pass
before
the
catastrophe
could
possibly
occur
but
added
that
to
prepare
for
the
worst
he
had
ordered
the
construction
of
two
rafts
one
for
the
use
of
the
seamen
the
other
for
the
reception
of
food
and
necessaries
his
plan
was
to
attach
these
to
the
larger
boats
and
so
provide
against
want
in
the
certainty
however
that
on
such
a
route
relief
must
soon
present
itself
in
the
shape
of
ship
or
steamer
he
called
on
all
able
to
abet
his
exertions
to
present
themselves
forthwith
so
that
universal
safety
might
be
insured
not
only
by
making
the
rafts
but
the
securing
of
food
upon
them
and
comforts
for
the
women
and
children
who
represented
so
large
a
portion
of
the
passengers
he
answered
for
the
fidelity
of
his
seamen
with
his
life
there
was
not
one
among
them
he
knew
who
would
lift
a
finger
to
disobey
him
he
said
these
words
in
conclusion
and
now
if
there
is
any
one
present
sufficiently
imbued
with
the
grace
of
god
to
fix
the
anxious
minds
of
these
voyagers
in
prayer
such
at
least
of
them
as
are
powerless
otherwise
to
aid
our
exertions
let
him
appear
and
minister
to
their
tribulation
this
task
is
not
for
me
although
the
holiest
my
duties
call
me
elsewhere
so
adjured
a
man
whose
wild
fanatical
appearance
had
given
rise
to
the
rumor
that
the
famous
lorenzo
dow
was
on
board
sprang
on
a
bulkhead
and
commenced
to
exhort
the
crowd
about
him
from
which
a
file
of
pale
men
was
slowly
emerging
to
join
the
seamen
at
the
other
end
of
the
vessel
in
their
efforts
for
the
public
weal
but
many
lingered
either
overcome
and
paralyzed
by
the
stringency
of
circumstances
or
unequal
to
exertions
from
personal
causes
aged
men
women
and
children
chiefly
and
to
these
the
frenzied
speaker
continued
to
address
his
words
of
exhortation
and
warning
such
a
tirade
of
terrible
objurgation
i
felt
was
entirely
out
of
place
in
a
scene
like
this
and
calculated
to
excite
the
worst
passions
of
the
human
mind
instead
of
persuading
it
to
serenity
and
submission
so
essential
now
for
to
me
the
captain
last
words
represented
the
final
grace
of
the
preacher
when
with
closed
eyes
and
outspread
hands
he
dismissed
his
flock
from
the
temple
at
the
close
of
the
services
from
that
vessel
and
all
that
concerned
it
we
were
virtually
enfranchised
from
that
moment
dismissed
to
destruction
so
to
speak
by
fire
or
flood
or
rescue
from
beyond
as
the
case
might
be
to
life
or
death
as
god
willed
for
the
ship
mission
was
accomplished
i
shrank
as
far
as
possible
from
the
wild
waving
arms
the
frenzied
eyes
the
gaunt
and
wolfish
aspect
the
piercing
agonized
voice
of
the
fanatic
who
had
assumed
to
himself
the
solemn
office
of
in
a
time
of
extremity
i
saw
from
a
distance
his
long
lank
figure
writhing
like
a
sapling
in
a
storm
as
it
overtopped
the
crowd
but
his
words
were
lost
on
my
ear
and
i
sat
leaning
back
against
the
bulwark
with
folded
hands
absorbed
in
my
own
thoughts
when
a
young
girl
bursting
from
the
throng
came
and
threw
herself
down
before
me
and
buried
her
face
in
my
lap
convulsed
with
sobs
when
she
looked
up
i
recognized
the
young
person
who
had
bathed
my
face
in
the
morning
during
my
partial
swoon
a
fair
and
girl
of
about
eighteen
years
pallid
and
ill
now
with
excitement
oh
it
is
so
terrible
she
cried
i
can
not
can
not
bear
it
and
he
says
we
are
all
hopelessly
lost
unless
we
have
repented
that
there
is
no
salvation
and
this
is
our
you
know
for
the
spanish
ship
passed
us
without
stopping
and
we
scarcely
hope
to
see
another
o
cruel
cruel
fiends
to
pretend
they
did
not
understand
our
signals
and
leave
us
to
destruction
and
she
clasped
her
hands
in
mute
and
bitter
despair
no
actress
was
ever
so
impressive
we
must
make
up
our
minds
to
the
worst
i
said
as
calmly
as
i
could
then
if
god
sees
fit
to
deliver
us
we
shall
be
all
the
more
thankful
you
must
not
believe
what
this
ignorant
and
man
tells
you
think
of
the
thief
on
the
cross
whom
christ
pardoned
in
dying
then
you
hope
to
be
permitted
to
see
god
you
dare
to
hope
this
she
asked
gazing
into
my
very
eyes
so
closely
did
she
come
to
me
oh
surely
in
his
own
good
time
i
have
done
nothing
so
very
wicked
i
hope
as
to
exclude
me
from
my
father
face
forever
have
you
now
do
be
frightened
speak
calmly
i
do
know
i
do
know
i
should
be
afraid
not
to
call
myself
desperately
wicked
at
such
a
time
he
says
we
all
are
you
know
we
are
all
miserable
sinners
it
is
very
abject
to
talk
and
feel
thus
and
i
do
believe
that
god
approves
of
it
i
said
indignantly
he
gives
us
and
commands
us
to
cherish
it
such
abasement
is
unworthy
of
christian
souls
it
is
very
bitter
to
die
as
young
as
we
are
but
if
we
have
done
our
best
to
serve
him
we
need
we
ought
not
to
be
afraid
to
meet
our
god
she
clung
to
my
outstretched
hand
she
strengthened
my
spirit
by
the
fullness
of
her
need
the
feeble
widow
with
her
child
too
crept
close
to
me
weeping
and
trembling
do
not
leave
me
she
entreated
let
us
stay
together
to
the
very
last
nay
that
may
be
a
long
time
i
answered
smiling
feebly
and
nerved
for
the
first
time
to
encouragement
for
the
captain
will
do
his
best
to
save
his
passengers
the
women
especially
i
can
not
doubt
and
see
what
bounteous
provision
he
is
making
for
their
support
and
i
pointed
to
the
piles
of
flour
and
sugar
barrels
the
boxes
of
crackers
and
of
hams
of
figs
and
raisins
the
hampers
of
wine
and
ale
which
were
profusely
piled
on
the
ready
for
lowering
to
the
rafts
he
means
to
take
care
of
us
you
see
by
the
permission
of
providence
i
said
almost
strengthened
by
this
dependence
and
we
will
remain
calmly
together
and
drink
whatever
cup
god
offers
us
humbly
i
hope
yet
even
as
i
spoke
my
heart
rebelled
against
the
fiat
of
my
fate
and
the
young
life
within
me
rose
up
in
fierce
conflict
with
its
doom
at
this
moment
of
bitter
strife
of
heart
dunmore
the
youthful
poet
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
stood
before
me
i
have
found
you
at
last
he
said
deputed
as
i
am
to
do
so
by
miss
lamarque
it
is
a
point
of
honor
with
her
to
care
for
you
personally
in
this
crisis
you
know
major
favraud
placed
you
under
her
care
besides
that
her
regard
for
you
impels
this
request
she
bids
me
say
i
interrupted
him
hastily
this
is
no
time
for
ceremonials
truly
dunmore
yet
had
family
concurrence
been
perfect
it
seems
to
me
that
her
brother
might
have
undertaken
this
mission
i
have
no
wish
to
thrust
myself
undesired
into
any
household
circle
at
such
a
crisis
he
is
wholly
absorbed
with
his
children
as
he
ought
to
be
dunmore
and
when
the
time
of
peril
comes
it
is
of
their
needs
alone
that
he
will
and
must
think
i
am
alone
in
this
vessel
as
i
shall
remain
i
did
not
leave
savannah
under
miss
lamarque
care
she
is
very
generous
very
considerate
but
i
will
not
embarrass
her
motions
nor
yours
nor
any
one
it
is
the
duty
of
captain
ambrose
to
see
to
the
welfare
of
his
female
passengers
i
shall
not
be
forgotten
among
these
he
stood
before
me
with
his
knightly
head
uncovered
his
handsome
face
as
calm
as
though
he
were
a
guest
at
a
festival
instead
of
a
patient
and
interested
watcher
at
a
his
birth
his
breeding
his
genius
even
asserted
themselves
in
that
mortal
hour
he
was
calm
collected
serious
but
not
afraid
the
peril
will
be
great
to
all
of
course
he
said
quietly
but
no
gentleman
will
prefer
his
own
safety
to
that
of
the
most
humble
and
desolate
woman
on
the
ship
to
you
miss
harz
i
devote
my
energies
to
you
and
these
ladies
of
your
party
whoever
they
may
be
bowing
gently
as
he
spoke
i
may
fail
in
delivering
you
from
danger
but
it
shall
not
be
for
want
of
effort
on
my
part
believe
my
words
i
have
less
care
for
life
than
most
people
and
now
let
me
offer
you
my
escort
through
that
maddened
crowd
the
rest
may
follow
closely
to
reach
miss
lamarque
no
dunmore
i
remain
just
where
i
am
i
have
promised
myself
to
do
so
this
is
much
and
these
unhappy
women
they
like
myself
are
alone
or
seem
to
be
should
you
see
fit
to
do
so
and
be
willing
to
be
so
encumbered
you
can
return
after
a
lapse
of
time
but
make
no
point
of
this
i
entreat
you
i
think
that
captain
ambrose
will
observe
good
order
and
save
his
helpless
ones
first
you
know
he
promised
this
there
was
a
moment
pause
and
movement
of
eye
and
hand
and
then
he
spoke
again
very
softly
yes
and
much
more
that
can
never
be
fulfilled
for
already
the
cabin
is
in
flames
the
is
closed
and
the
fire
in
the
hold
is
making
fearful
headway
i
have
heard
the
seamen
have
sworn
to
secure
the
boats
you
are
strong
and
resolute
be
prepared
for
the
very
worst
then
speaking
in
his
usual
tone
he
added
since
the
banner
of
spain
passed
near
enough
to
show
us
the
rampant
lions
and
castles
on
its
crimson
shield
and
yet
made
no
sign
i
have
had
little
hope
of
rescue
from
a
ship
it
was
ominous
not
intended
then
i
said
eagerly
oh
i
am
glad
of
this
at
least
for
the
honor
of
human
nature
a
strange
consideration
at
such
a
time
you
are
a
study
to
me
miss
harz
yours
is
not
apathy
like
mine
but
true
courage
even
in
this
and
i
will
save
you
if
i
can
for
you
have
a
noble
soul
all
further
dialogue
was
cut
short
by
the
wild
shout
that
rose
from
the
crowd
the
delusive
cry
of
a
sail
a
sail
and
dunmore
rushed
with
the
rest
to
descry
its
form
if
possible
it
was
some
moments
before
hope
again
died
down
to
a
flat
level
of
despair
too
remote
for
signal
or
trumpet
was
that
distant
vessel
gliding
securely
on
its
path
of
peace
unconscious
of
the
extremity
of
the
mighty
steamer
it
distinguished
dimly
no
doubt
by
the
aid
of
telescopes
however
this
might
have
been
for
the
second
time
on
that
day
of
direst
exigency
a
ship
went
by
observed
yet
unobserving
fainter
and
fainter
grew
the
accents
of
the
fierce
fanatical
preacher
his
excitement
forsook
him
as
the
danger
became
more
and
more
imminent
the
crowd
broke
into
groups
pale
stern
men
with
rigid
features
who
had
been
employed
aiding
in
the
construction
of
the
rafts
returned
now
to
the
sides
of
their
wives
and
children
through
a
vista
on
the
deck
i
discerned
miss
lamarque
sitting
quietly
with
her
youngest
nursling
in
her
arms
beside
her
brother
his
children
and
slaves
were
gathered
around
her
knees
dunmore
was
giving
her
my
message
i
could
not
doubt
from
the
glances
she
cast
in
my
direction
as
he
stood
near
by
i
knew
that
he
would
soon
turn
to
come
again
but
my
resolution
was
fixed
captain
ambrose
with
a
face
grown
old
in
half
a
day
gray
abstracted
wretched
passed
and
repassed
me
several
times
telescope
in
hand
ralph
maxwell
on
the
kept
constant
watch
his
attitude
dauntless
his
face
uplifted
and
keen
in
hand
his
training
stood
him
in
good
stead
now
captain
falconer
a
naval
officer
had
returned
to
the
side
of
miss
oscanyan
the
woman
he
had
loved
hopelessly
for
years
and
before
the
scene
closed
between
us
forever
i
saw
him
clasp
her
to
his
bosom
so
that
trying
hour
had
for
some
high
spirits
is
crowning
consolations
its
solace
and
reward
and
whatever
else
was
in
store
the
martyrdom
of
love
was
over
an
eager
hand
caught
my
shawl
he
is
coming
back
coming
to
persuade
you
to
leave
us
said
the
young
girl
but
you
have
promised
not
to
part
from
us
and
i
feel
that
god
will
remember
us
if
we
remain
together
firm
and
fast
we
three
then
the
pale
widow
spoke
in
turn
let
me
stay
beside
you
too
she
entreated
it
makes
me
feel
stronger
i
am
so
desolate
and
she
bowed
her
head
and
wept
i
would
have
said
in
the
strange
calm
bitterness
that
possessed
my
soul
what
value
has
life
to
you
and
your
deformed
one
poor
widowed
sickly
and
despised
why
should
you
wish
to
live
why
encumber
me
but
thoughts
like
these
were
not
for
human
utterance
now
and
we
sat
together
hand
locked
in
hand
for
a
time
waiting
for
the
end
as
men
may
wait
in
years
to
come
when
the
earth
is
gray
with
sin
for
the
coming
of
the
fiery
comet
that
they
know
is
destined
to
consume
them
for
was
not
this
ship
our
world
penned
in
as
we
were
on
every
side
and
separated
from
all
else
by
an
ocean
inexorable
and
illimitable
as
space
and
were
not
we
likewise
looking
forward
to
a
fiery
doom
our
finite
perhaps
final
day
of
judgment
i
could
understand
then
for
the
first
time
how
condemned
criminals
feel
well
strong
yet
dying
i
knew
how
walter
la
vigne
the
had
felt
and
some
passages
of
madame
roland
appeal
rose
visibly
before
me
as
if
written
on
the
air
rather
than
in
my
memory
i
had
read
the
book
at
beauseincourt
and
it
had
powerfully
impressed
me
and
this
i
remember
was
the
passage
that
swept
across
my
brain
and
thou
whom
i
dare
not
name
wouldst
thou
mourn
to
see
me
preceding
thee
to
a
place
where
we
can
love
one
another
without
wrong
where
nothing
will
prevent
our
union
where
all
pernicious
prejudices
all
arbitrary
exclusions
all
hateful
passions
and
all
tyranny
are
silent
i
shall
wait
for
thee
then
and
rest
so
centred
were
my
dying
thoughts
on
wentworth
so
calmly
did
i
await
the
great
change
that
men
call
sudden
death
all
this
time
a
time
much
briefer
than
that
i
have
taken
in
recounting
my
sensations
the
glorious
summer
sun
the
sun
of
morning
was
bathing
the
sea
the
ship
with
beauty
and
a
soft
fresh
breeze
was
fanning
every
pallid
brow
with
a
caressing
silken
wing
that
seemed
to
mock
its
wretchedness
i
thought
not
once
of
christian
garth
i
had
ceased
to
strain
my
eyes
for
a
distant
sail
to
seek
to
compromise
with
my
fate
or
make
conditions
with
my
creator
dunmore
was
forgotten
i
was
composed
to
die
not
resigned
these
things
are
different
a
bitter
patience
possessed
me
that
i
felt
would
sustain
me
to
the
end
but
i
was
not
satisfied
that
my
doom
was
just
or
opportune
farewell
sweet
young
vigorous
life
i
moaned
aloud
farewell
miriam
it
will
not
be
thou
but
a
phantom
that
shall
arise
from
dead
ashes
farewell
dear
hand
that
hast
served
me
long
and
well
and
i
kissed
my
own
right
hand
i
had
not
known
until
that
moment
how
truly
i
loved
myself
sister
lover
farewell
mother
father
receive
me
gentle
constance
reach
forth
thy
guiding
hand
and
lead
me
to
my
parents
wentworth
remember
me
saviour
my
soul
is
thine
i
bowed
my
head
i
had
no
more
to
say
unwilling
i
was
to
die
afraid
i
was
not
for
as
i
sat
there
my
whole
life
swept
before
me
as
it
is
said
to
do
before
the
eyes
of
the
drowning
and
rapidly
as
one
may
sweep
the
gamut
on
a
piano
with
one
introverted
finger
and
i
saw
myself
as
though
i
had
been
another
i
had
done
nothing
to
make
me
afraid
to
meet
my
god
so
with
closed
eyes
i
lingered
in
the
shadow
conscious
of
nothing
save
exceeding
calm
when
the
grasp
of
my
gentle
friend
of
the
moment
aroused
me
to
a
sense
of
what
was
occurring
and
i
saw
with
horror
indescribable
the
fierce
flames
leaping
from
the
deck
heard
the
hoarse
shouts
beheld
the
lurid
surging
of
an
agonized
and
despairing
multitude
but
above
all
rang
the
clear
of
captain
ambrose
soon
to
sink
in
death
to
the
boats
to
the
boats
but
save
the
women
first
the
children
as
ye
are
christian
men
so
help
ye
mighty
god
i
heard
later
how
signally
this
noble
charge
was
disregarded
how
utterly
self
triumphed
over
generosity
and
duty
and
how
in
enforcing
the
example
all
should
have
followed
captain
ambrose
lost
his
valiant
valuable
life
but
this
was
thought
nothing
of
then
and
i
sat
patiently
down
to
perish
chapter
iv
it
was
sunset
when
i
first
felt
able
to
sit
up
beneath
the
awning
of
sails
which
provident
hands
had
stretched
above
the
central
platform
reserved
for
the
occupancy
of
the
women
and
children
spread
thick
with
mattresses
on
the
raft
and
look
about
me
understandingly
we
were
riding
smoothly
over
the
long
low
level
billows
of
that
summer
sea
sustained
beyond
their
reach
on
what
seemed
a
rude
composed
as
this
was
of
the
masts
booms
and
yards
roughly
lashed
together
by
tarred
ropes
no
longer
needed
on
the
destined
ship
and
which
had
been
assigned
by
the
captain
for
that
purpose
to
christian
garth
a
mast
was
erected
in
the
front
of
this
raft
on
three
sides
of
which
were
breastworks
with
strong
loose
ropes
attached
so
that
those
who
clung
to
this
refuge
might
support
themselves
with
comparative
safety
or
rather
have
a
chance
for
life
when
our
floating
grave
should
hang
suspended
perpendicularly
on
the
steep
side
of
a
or
drift
beneath
it
just
below
and
surrounding
the
small
elevated
platform
on
which
i
found
myself
when
i
revived
stretched
on
a
slender
mattress
by
the
side
of
my
feeble
widow
and
her
moaning
child
were
rows
of
barrels
firmly
fastened
by
cleats
so
as
insure
to
some
degree
not
only
the
preservation
of
our
food
and
water
but
to
form
a
sort
of
bulwark
of
protection
for
those
who
occupied
the
central
portion
of
the
raft
the
young
girl
of
whom
i
have
spoken
as
having
attached
herself
to
me
during
the
last
moments
of
my
stay
on
shipboard
and
an
old
negro
woman
whose
crooning
hymns
made
a
strange
accompaniment
to
the
dashing
waters
and
whose
stolid
tranquillity
seemed
to
reproach
my
anguish
were
our
only
companions
on
the
sort
of
dais
assigned
to
his
female
passengers
by
christian
garth
the
man
himself
to
whom
we
owed
our
deliverance
stood
near
his
primitive
mast
trimming
his
sail
carefully
and
looking
out
with
his
sagacious
ken
over
the
waste
of
waters
into
which
the
sun
seemed
dipping
suddenly
as
for
his
a
few
of
the
common
passengers
of
the
kosciusko
and
a
knot
of
the
seamen
comprising
not
more
than
twenty
souls
composed
the
groups
scattered
about
the
roughly
yet
securely
lashed
raft
silent
and
observant
all
as
men
who
face
their
doom
are
apt
to
be
i
looked
in
vain
for
one
familiar
face
and
for
a
moment
regretted
that
i
had
been
withheld
as
by
some
spell
for
whose
weird
influence
i
could
never
sufficiently
account
from
having
cast
my
destiny
with
theirs
who
were
so
much
nearer
to
me
in
station
and
congeniality
of
spirit
than
those
around
me
with
miss
lamarque
hand
locked
in
mine
i
should
have
vied
with
her
i
felt
in
cheerful
courage
and
the
knightly
calmness
of
dunmore
might
have
sustained
my
drooping
fainting
soul
these
were
my
peers
and
them
i
should
have
been
better
content
to
be
tried
but
the
white
squall
which
had
in
no
way
affected
us
so
small
and
partial
was
the
sphere
of
its
influence
had
sufficed
to
separate
ours
irretrievably
from
our
and
the
squadron
of
boats
that
had
promised
not
to
forsake
as
and
now
the
eye
of
agony
was
strained
in
vain
over
the
weltering
waste
for
a
vestige
of
those
refugees
from
the
kosciusko
buried
perhaps
a
thousand
fathoms
deep
by
their
sudden
visitors
beneath
the
waves
of
that
deadly
atlantic
sea
tears
rained
over
my
face
as
i
thought
of
this
probability
and
hopeless
as
i
was
of
rescue
the
almost
certain
fate
of
my
fell
over
me
like
a
pall
better
perhaps
far
better
had
it
been
i
thought
so
then
had
we
all
perished
together
in
that
terrific
sheet
of
flame
that
rose
up
like
a
dividing
barrier
between
us
at
the
last
fit
emblem
of
the
final
day
of
doom
our
trials
were
but
begun
what
more
remained
god
in
heaven
only
knew
and
rapidly
and
in
panoramic
succession
all
the
fearful
adventures
of
raft
and
boat
that
i
had
ever
read
of
or
heard
related
passed
across
my
mind
ending
with
that
latest
and
perhaps
the
most
fearful
of
all
the
wreck
of
the
medusa
the
night
came
down
serene
and
beautiful
as
the
sun
disappeared
in
ocean
up
rose
the
moon
crimson
and
magnified
by
surrounding
vapors
that
to
the
practised
eye
portended
future
tempest
calm
as
the
ocean
and
the
heavens
then
seemed
the
constellations
singularly
distinct
and
splendid
had
the
power
to
fix
and
fascinate
my
vision
never
felt
before
as
they
shone
above
me
clear
and
crystalline
as
enthroned
in
space
judges
and
spectators
cold
and
pitiless
as
it
seemed
to
me
in
the
strangeness
and
forlornness
of
my
condition
arcturus
and
the
ursas
great
and
little
and
lyra
and
the
corona
borealis
berenice
and
hydra
and
cassiopea
chair
these
and
many
more
i
marked
them
all
with
a
calm
scrutiny
that
belongs
to
terror
in
some
phases
the
stars
seemed
mocking
eyes
that
night
smiling
and
safe
in
heaven
the
moon
a
cold
and
cruel
enemy
with
her
vapory
train
so
grandly
sailing
across
the
cloudless
heaven
so
careless
of
our
fate
the
wreck
of
a
ruined
world
as
many
deem
her
veiling
in
light
her
inward
desolation
a
faint
and
vapory
comet
lurked
on
the
horizon
like
a
ghastly
messenger
scarcely
discernible
to
the
human
eyes
yet
vaguely
ominous
and
suggestive
a
it
might
be
watching
in
silence
to
hear
away
the
souls
of
those
lost
at
sea
there
was
deep
stillness
unbroken
save
by
the
lapping
and
plashing
waters
even
the
crooning
hymns
of
the
old
negro
woman
had
died
away
and
the
moans
of
the
suffering
child
and
the
sobs
of
the
weary
mother
and
the
eager
exclamations
of
ada
greene
for
such
i
learned
was
the
name
of
my
young
companion
were
for
a
season
lost
alike
in
sleep
food
had
been
distributed
prayer
had
been
offered
all
seemed
favorable
so
far
to
our
preservation
we
were
on
the
track
of
voyage
the
pathway
of
ships
and
the
sea
was
tranquil
as
a
summer
lake
up
to
this
point
the
arm
of
god
had
been
extended
over
us
almost
visibly
would
he
forsake
us
now
i
questioned
thus
and
yet
i
could
not
dare
not
hope
as
others
hoped
the
morning
came
i
woke
aroused
by
salva
song
from
troubled
sleep
and
as
i
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
a
troop
of
that
had
been
swooping
overhead
fled
with
a
screaming
the
mother
and
child
were
already
consuming
their
scant
allowance
of
food
ada
greene
was
standing
swaying
like
a
slender
reed
with
the
motion
of
the
raft
so
as
never
to
lose
her
balance
like
a
young
acrobat
with
her
folded
arms
her
floating
hair
and
fair
aurora
face
uplifted
to
the
day
over
the
raft
were
scattered
groups
of
men
taking
their
morning
meal
but
as
before
the
stalwart
form
of
christian
garth
was
at
the
helm
or
rather
mast
and
rudder
merged
in
one
which
he
controlled
with
calm
sagacious
power
is
there
a
ship
in
the
distance
that
you
gaze
so
earnestly
i
asked
of
the
young
girl
as
i
put
back
my
hair
that
had
clustered
thickly
over
my
face
in
my
uneasy
slumber
and
followed
eagerly
the
direction
of
her
eyes
oh
no
only
a
school
of
dolphins
but
it
is
so
pretty
some
came
quite
near
just
now
the
men
were
harpooning
them
but
if
we
had
them
we
could
not
cook
them
you
know
on
this
miserable
contrivance
one
we
should
be
very
grateful
for
ada
since
it
is
all
that
lies
between
us
and
destruction
i
answered
sorrowfully
for
the
levity
of
her
spirit
grieved
and
shocked
me
i
do
know
about
that
i
think
we
might
as
well
have
gone
down
at
once
as
stay
here
and
be
roasted
and
starved
how
hot
it
is
what
would
i
not
give
for
a
good
glass
of
do
look
so
shocked
we
shall
be
saved
of
course
i
am
not
the
least
afraid
about
that
for
garth
says
we
see
a
ship
before
evening
do
you
mark
the
flag
flying
at
the
he
brought
it
on
board
on
purpose
so
that
they
might
not
mistake
our
country
the
packets
i
mean
and
give
us
the
as
that
spanish
vessel
did
but
they
do
say
that
was
a
pirate
and
that
instead
of
sitting
on
a
plank
we
should
have
been
walking
a
plank
by
this
time
had
they
rescued
us
i
rather
glad
they
did
though
after
all
things
could
be
much
worse
than
they
are
could
they
now
there
i
came
very
near
falling
i
declare
the
moans
of
the
sick
woman
at
my
side
became
almost
constant
toward
noon
and
she
was
obliged
to
surrender
her
infant
wholly
to
my
charge
for
the
hÃ¦morrhage
of
the
day
before
had
returned
and
she
was
fast
drifting
into
unconsciousness
water
water
was
the
only
intelligible
cry
that
left
her
lips
and
that
we
had
to
give
was
warm
and
brackish
from
the
occasional
lapping
of
the
sea
against
the
barrels
into
which
it
oozed
insensibly
the
sun
shone
down
hot
and
brazen
from
the
lurid
heavens
covered
with
filmy
clouds
so
equally
overspreading
it
that
a
thin
gray
veil
seemed
to
interpose
between
us
and
its
scorching
rays
scarcely
tempering
them
by
its
diaphanous
medium
beneath
it
lay
the
sea
like
a
copper
shield
smooth
and
glowing
seething
like
a
boiling
caldron
with
its
level
foam
for
the
long
billows
lifted
themselves
but
lazily
from
ocean
breast
and
assumed
no
distinctness
of
form
or
motion
not
the
faintest
breeze
came
to
relieve
the
stifling
closeness
of
the
atmosphere
or
lift
the
collapsed
sail
or
furled
flag
that
clung
around
our
mast
the
air
shimmered
visibly
around
us
as
though
undergoing
some
transformation
from
the
heat
some
culinary
process
through
which
it
was
to
be
rendered
unfit
for
human
lips
to
breathe
birds
flew
low
and
heavily
around
the
raft
as
though
their
wings
met
such
resistance
as
fish
find
in
water
alighting
occasionally
to
pick
up
languidly
morsels
of
rejected
food
still
the
old
negro
crooning
hymns
went
on
recommenced
with
morning
light
to
my
sad
heart
the
refrain
bore
a
mournful
significance
in
the
land
of
the
new
jerusalem
there
shall
be
no
more
sea
she
sat
a
wrinkled
hag
with
a
leering
repulsive
face
with
her
feet
planted
firmly
on
her
mattress
her
knees
elevated
her
long
arms
closely
embracing
these
her
fingers
strung
with
brass
and
silver
rings
intertwined
with
flexibility
on
her
head
was
the
inevitable
handkerchief
the
badge
of
her
race
or
rather
of
her
condition
in
those
days
and
she
wore
the
decent
frock
which
marked
her
for
a
large
hoops
were
in
her
flat
enormous
ears
that
seemed
to
suspend
her
shoulders
as
they
touched
them
drawn
up
and
narrowed
as
these
were
even
beyond
their
natural
hideousness
by
her
attitude
one
which
she
maintained
as
stolidly
as
a
dervish
you
must
help
us
i
said
at
last
when
the
crisis
came
and
affairs
waxed
desperate
you
must
take
the
child
at
least
and
care
for
him
see
it
requires
two
persons
to
sustain
his
dying
mother
one
to
wet
her
lips
one
honey
she
interrupted
coolly
you
must
me
dis
oncst
i
has
jus
as
much
to
do
as
i
kin
posomply
in
keepin
of
myself
dry
comfable
and
singin
ob
my
we
has
all
to
take
our
chances
dis
time
an
do
for
our
own
selves
black
and
white
an
i
do
see
none
ob
my
own
white
folks
on
dis
raf
wich
i
is
mighty
proud
of
dar
now
i
does
dat
is
a
ship
sail
way
off
dar
does
you
see
it
honey
and
she
pointed
to
a
large
white
gull
skimming
the
main
at
some
distance
disgusted
with
her
selfishness
i
vouchsafed
her
no
farther
notice
at
the
time
and
her
crooning
went
on
during
the
whole
period
of
the
bitter
of
that
poor
sufferer
whose
name
i
never
knew
but
whose
little
deformed
waif
the
orphan
of
the
raft
remained
my
heritage
you
will
take
care
of
him
she
had
said
to
me
in
her
last
conscious
moments
my
my
little
the
name
died
on
her
lips
and
she
never
spoke
again
when
she
was
dead
christian
garth
caused
her
to
be
wrapped
in
weighted
with
chains
and
with
a
brief
prayer
consigned
to
the
deep
his
superstitious
sailor
fears
rebelled
against
the
idea
of
keeping
a
corpse
on
board
one
moment
longer
than
necessary
so
the
rites
of
sepulture
were
speedily
accomplished
when
i
remonstrated
feebly
enough
it
is
true
for
exhaustion
was
supervening
on
effort
at
his
haste
which
even
under
the
circumstances
seemed
to
me
indecent
he
coolly
spoke
of
it
as
a
measure
essential
to
the
good
of
all
talismanic
as
were
these
words
on
such
occasion
mine
were
the
lips
that
murmured
the
brief
prayer
a
portion
of
the
solemn
episcopal
that
i
chanced
to
remember
above
the
poor
pale
corpse
even
while
my
weary
arms
inclosed
the
struggling
child
who
understanding
nothing
of
the
truth
would
fain
have
plunged
after
his
mother
into
depths
unknown
a
low
long
roll
of
thunder
smote
on
the
ear
like
a
message
to
the
ocean
from
the
heavens
above
as
we
saw
the
waters
close
greedily
over
the
form
of
our
dead
passenger
the
men
who
had
launched
the
body
from
the
raft
looked
up
and
listened
fearfully
and
christian
garth
hastened
to
trim
his
sail
it
was
sunset
now
and
the
clouds
gathered
so
rapidly
about
the
sun
that
he
sank
empalled
in
purple
to
his
watery
bed
leaving
no
trace
behind
to
mark
his
faded
splendor
a
sudden
breeze
sprang
up
infinitely
refreshing
at
first
to
soul
and
sense
and
again
the
thunder
lumbered
and
crashed
about
us
the
billows
heaved
and
leaped
like
steeds
just
freed
from
harness
tossing
their
white
manes
the
raft
shuddered
and
reeled
with
a
deadly
sickly
motion
like
a
creature
in
strong
throes
plunging
with
frantic
suddenness
into
the
troughs
of
the
waves
at
one
moment
as
if
impelled
by
fear
then
rallying
to
their
summits
only
to
cast
itself
wildly
down
again
all
was
confusion
dire
and
terrible
then
burst
the
storm
upon
us
rain
wind
i
was
conscious
of
clutching
with
one
hand
a
rope
which
strained
and
swayed
desperately
while
with
the
other
i
grasped
the
affrighted
baby
to
my
breast
ada
greene
and
the
old
negro
woman
clung
together
hanging
to
the
same
cord
of
safety
flung
to
them
to
all
of
us
by
the
hand
of
christian
garth
the
barrels
strained
and
groaned
and
broke
from
their
fastenings
the
awning
was
wrenched
from
its
mooring
and
swept
away
the
bitter
brine
broke
over
us
and
choked
our
cries
the
anguish
of
death
was
upon
as
without
its
submission
we
struggled
instinctively
to
breathe
to
live
we
grappled
desperately
with
circumstances
we
fought
against
our
doom
suddenly
the
sea
dropped
to
rest
the
storm
was
spent
a
low
sighing
soughing
gale
swept
around
our
nucleus
of
despair
and
the
surging
of
the
sea
was
like
a
bitter
the
air
grew
cold
and
chill
one
vast
cloud
enveloped
the
whole
face
of
the
unpitying
heavens
that
seemed
literally
to
press
down
upon
our
very
faces
like
a
roof
of
black
marble
no
moon
no
stars
were
visible
we
had
no
light
of
any
kind
nor
could
we
ascertain
the
damage
done
until
the
cold
gray
morning
broke
in
gloom
and
rain
upon
us
then
it
was
made
plain
to
us
that
our
food
had
all
been
swept
overboard
together
with
six
seamen
and
five
of
the
passengers
there
remained
on
the
raft
only
three
shuddering
women
and
a
little
child
and
a
handful
of
weary
and
discouraged
men
sustained
and
led
to
a
sense
of
duty
by
the
dauntless
of
one
alone
the
presence
of
christian
garth
indomitable
through
all
hardships
so
it
had
fared
with
us
for
hours
of
our
experience
on
our
floating
grave
we
had
been
washed
from
our
little
platform
which
ordinarily
lifted
us
above
the
lapping
of
the
sea
during
the
prevalence
of
the
storm
and
we
regained
it
now
glad
to
repose
even
on
the
mattresses
bereft
of
awning
by
the
mercy
of
god
some
glutinous
had
been
tangled
among
them
and
by
the
help
of
the
biscuit
in
my
pocket
crammed
there
it
may
be
remembered
as
a
precious
hoard
for
a
time
of
dire
necessity
on
the
morning
of
the
fire
by
the
small
cunning
fingers
of
the
sickly
child
we
breakfasted
or
rather
broke
our
fast
we
four
the
child
the
negress
ada
greene
and
i
and
life
was
aroused
again
in
every
breast
by
means
of
a
briny
morsel
a
cup
of
coffee
would
not
be
amiss
just
now
said
the
girl
laughing
but
the
lord
knows
we
can
wait
there
was
a
strange
bright
light
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
girl
as
she
spoke
these
words
and
she
was
arraying
her
hair
coquettishly
with
some
bunches
of
which
had
been
cast
up
by
the
storm
and
from
which
the
eager
famishing
lips
of
the
little
boy
had
been
permitted
to
suck
the
gluten
before
discarding
the
skeleton
stems
that
hair
was
in
itself
a
grace
and
glory
rippling
from
crown
to
waist
in
sheeny
golden
splendor
fine
as
silk
and
glossy
as
the
yellow
floss
threads
of
pale
ripe
beautiful
even
in
its
dishevelled
and
drenched
condition
as
an
artist
dream
devoid
as
it
was
of
regular
beauty
the
face
beneath
with
its
clear
blue
eyes
red
lips
and
pure
complexion
the
pink
and
white
that
reminds
one
of
a
or
had
struck
me
as
very
lovely
from
the
first
nothing
to
support
this
ground
work
of
excellence
had
i
discovered
however
either
in
the
form
of
the
head
which
was
ignoble
or
the
expression
of
the
face
which
was
both
timid
and
defiant
or
the
tones
of
the
voice
which
were
shrill
and
harsh
by
turns
yet
as
my
and
sufferer
i
was
interested
in
this
young
creature
not
forgetting
either
her
attention
during
my
pending
swoon
of
which
mention
has
been
made
i
am
going
to
the
party
whatever
the
preacher
may
say
and
whether
captain
ambrose
wills
it
or
no
i
am
under
his
care
and
protection
you
see
to
go
to
new
york
to
my
aunt
madame
du
vert
the
famous
milliner
and
i
am
to
learn
her
trade
her
name
is
greene
so
they
call
her
du
vert
to
make
out
that
she
is
french
is
in
french
you
see
or
so
they
tell
me
now
captain
ambrose
is
a
too
and
he
does
not
want
dancing
on
his
ship
and
so
he
made
the
calkers
pitch
the
deck
that
was
to
break
up
the
ball
you
know
but
do
tell
any
one
this
for
the
sake
drawing
near
to
me
and
whispering
strangely
with
her
forefinger
raised
or
all
those
proud
southern
people
would
pitch
into
me
pitch
you
understand
and
she
laughed
merrily
their
white
satin
slippers
and
all
you
must
not
talk
so
ada
and
i
took
her
hand
which
was
burning
why
not
who
are
you
to
prevent
me
i
am
as
good
as
you
any
day
or
miss
lamarque
either
or
any
of
those
haughty
ones
though
my
father
was
a
well
whose
business
was
that
but
god
if
he
care
who
need
care
a
i
right
old
mammy
appealing
to
the
ancient
negress
who
had
suspended
her
croon
to
listen
yes
indeed
that
you
is
honey
right
to
upholden
your
own
dad
nebber
min
what
he
did
to
serbe
the
debble
but
you
looks
mighty
strange
chile
outen
your
eyes
wat
dat
you
sees
ober
dar
is
it
a
ship
gal
or
must
we
and
her
voice
sank
to
a
mutter
must
we
fall
back
on
dis
picaninny
to
keep
from
starvation
i
understood
her
dreadful
suggestion
even
before
the
words
fully
left
her
cannibal
lips
exposing
her
yellow
fangs
from
the
glance
of
her
cruel
eye
in
the
direction
of
the
child
and
the
working
of
her
long
crooked
talons
rather
than
fingers
writhed
like
knotted
serpents
i
understood
them
with
an
instinct
that
made
me
clutch
him
closely
to
my
breast
and
narrowly
watch
his
enemy
from
that
hour
until
the
time
when
my
brain
failed
and
my
eyes
closed
in
unconsciousness
and
with
the
determination
to
plunge
with
him
into
the
sea
rather
than
devote
him
to
such
a
fate
or
yield
to
such
an
alternative
as
this
wretch
in
human
form
had
more
than
hinted
even
should
the
animal
instinct
underlying
every
nature
presume
to
dictate
to
reason
at
the
last
we
could
but
die
that
was
the
very
worst
that
fate
had
in
store
for
us
die
in
the
body
how
infinitely
worse
that
the
soul
should
perish
through
the
selfish
sensuousness
of
cannibalism
which
would
degrade
life
itself
below
dissolution
even
if
preserved
by
such
means
i
am
ready
now
to
go
to
captain
ambrose
for
assistance
said
ada
greene
poising
herself
before
me
and
having
surrendered
or
forgotten
her
first
idea
evidently
in
the
new
mania
of
the
moment
of
course
he
does
not
intend
to
leave
us
here
to
perish
and
he
is
in
the
next
cabin
but
a
step
see
how
easily
i
can
get
to
him
and
i
shall
be
back
before
you
can
say
as
nimbly
as
a
runs
upon
the
sand
the
young
creature
flew
across
the
now
level
raft
toward
the
sea
but
a
strong
hand
clutched
her
as
she
was
about
to
step
overboard
and
compelled
her
back
to
her
place
on
the
platform
where
bound
with
cords
she
lay
raving
until
sleep
or
unconsciousness
mercifully
supervened
to
spare
me
the
spectacle
of
her
agony
which
no
human
power
could
alleviate
hours
passed
before
this
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
took
effect
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
my
reeling
brain
my
fainting
energies
warned
me
that
i
too
was
probably
approaching
some
dreadful
crisis
with
a
view
to
the
refreshment
its
waters
could
possibly
afford
my
head
i
crept
quietly
from
the
platform
on
which
the
old
negro
woman
held
enforced
guard
over
the
insensible
form
of
ada
greene
and
still
clasping
the
poor
helpless
one
so
mysteriously
thrust
upon
my
tender
mercies
to
my
bosom
i
gained
the
edge
of
the
raft
unnoticed
by
christian
garth
who
might
otherwise
have
apprehended
me
in
turn
and
borne
me
back
to
my
allotted
precincts
and
hung
above
the
ocean
so
as
to
suffer
its
cooling
spray
to
fall
unceasingly
across
my
burning
forehead
from
some
instinctive
prompting
i
had
lashed
the
poor
frail
baby
to
my
girdle
with
the
scarf
of
knotted
silk
i
wore
about
my
neck
and
wan
and
exhausted
he
lay
upon
my
shoulder
tranquilly
as
any
indian
papoose
might
do
on
its
mother
breast
a
branch
of
floated
past
as
i
looked
down
some
gracious
mermaid
gift
perhaps
extended
by
her
invisible
fingers
to
greet
our
famishing
lips
and
i
caught
it
eagerly
dividing
the
welcome
nutriment
with
the
perishing
child
now
patient
from
weakness
and
instinctive
consciousness
perhaps
of
the
entire
uselessness
of
cries
and
tears
whether
the
weed
was
a
sort
of
or
wholesome
aliment
i
never
knew
but
certain
it
is
that
from
the
moment
its
juices
passed
my
lips
a
strange
and
delightful
quietude
stole
over
my
weary
senses
fast
lapsing
as
these
had
seemed
into
unconsciousness
when
i
left
my
place
to
seek
the
ocean
brink
the
rays
of
the
declining
sun
seemed
for
a
moment
centred
on
one
spot
immediately
before
my
impending
face
supported
as
this
was
on
one
hand
and
my
sight
followed
their
rays
to
the
very
floor
of
ocean
as
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
divided
for
the
passage
of
moses
and
the
israelites
so
seemed
these
to
part
for
my
mental
eyes
sundered
as
they
were
by
a
golden
sword
of
infinite
splendor
that
power
which
neither
pain
nor
peril
can
subdue
had
possession
of
me
now
and
above
all
the
bitter
circumstances
that
surrounded
me
and
in
the
face
of
danger
and
of
death
imagination
asserted
her
supremacy
my
dream
was
not
of
passing
ship
or
harbor
gained
or
rich
repast
or
festival
or
clustered
grapes
and
sparkling
wines
like
other
sufferers
from
shipwreck
fevered
with
famine
frenzied
with
despair
but
hasheesh
or
opium
never
bestowed
so
fair
so
strange
a
vision
as
that
which
in
my
extremity
was
mercifully
accorded
to
me
my
eyes
pursued
the
to
its
base
as
a
telescope
conducts
the
mortal
gaze
to
revel
in
the
stars
merman
and
mermaid
nereid
and
triton
were
there
rejoicing
in
the
sunbeams
thus
poured
upon
them
through
this
subtle
conduit
of
ocean
as
do
the
motes
of
summer
in
her
rays
but
soon
these
disappeared
a
motley
crowd
confused
and
joyous
leaving
the
vision
free
to
pierce
the
depths
glowing
with
golden
light
in
search
of
still
greater
marvels
then
i
saw
outspread
before
me
the
streets
the
fanes
the
towers
the
dwellings
of
a
vast
deserted
city
one
of
those
i
could
not
doubt
that
had
existed
before
the
flood
and
which
had
lain
submerged
for
thousands
of
centuries
the
fretwork
of
the
was
over
all
that
worker
against
time
so
slow
so
certain
in
one
monotonous
web
of
solid
snow
statues
of
colossal
size
and
arches
of
titanic
strength
and
power
adorned
the
portals
the
the
temples
of
this
metropolis
of
ocean
guarded
as
were
these
last
by
the
effigies
of
griffin
and
dragon
and
winged
elephant
and
lion
and
stately
mastodon
and
monstrous
ichthyosaurus
all
white
as
gleaming
spar
gods
and
of
gigantic
proportions
and
majestic
aspect
were
carved
on
the
external
walls
of
the
windowless
abodes
and
fanes
and
from
the
yawning
portal
of
one
of
these
a
temple
vast
as
self
came
forth
fold
after
fold
even
as
i
seemed
to
gaze
the
monstrous
of
which
mariners
dream
more
huge
more
loathly
than
fancy
or
experience
ever
yet
portrayed
him
i
still
behold
in
memory
the
stately
fearful
head
with
its
eyes
of
emerald
fire
and
sweeping
mane
as
it
reared
its
neck
for
a
moment
as
if
to
scale
the
ladder
the
sunbeams
had
thrown
down
when
first
emerging
from
its
and
later
the
mottled
monstrous
body
as
coil
after
coil
was
gradually
unwound
until
it
seemed
at
last
to
lie
in
all
its
loathsome
length
for
roods
along
the
silent
streets
the
scaly
monarch
of
that
scene
of
human
desolation
i
recall
the
feeling
of
security
that
upheld
me
to
look
and
to
observe
every
motion
of
the
reptile
of
my
dream
he
can
not
come
to
me
here
i
thought
the
ark
is
sacred
and
hand
is
over
it
besides
i
hear
the
singing
of
the
priests
and
the
dove
is
about
to
be
cast
forth
will
the
raven
never
come
back
oh
the
sweet
it
falls
so
lightly
we
are
nearing
the
mountain
now
and
we
shall
soon
cast
anchor
then
among
choral
chants
of
joy
and
thanksgiving
i
seemed
to
sleep
how
long
this
slumber
lasted
or
whether
it
came
at
all
i
never
knew
it
is
a
loving
and
tender
thing
in
our
creator
to
decree
to
us
this
curtain
of
unconsciousness
when
nerve
and
strength
would
otherwise
give
way
beneath
the
intensity
of
suffering
a
holy
and
gentle
thing
for
which
we
are
not
half
thankful
enough
in
oar
estimate
of
blessings
my
sleep
or
swoon
shielded
me
from
long
hours
of
agony
mental
and
physical
that
must
have
become
unendurable
ere
the
close
as
it
was
i
knew
no
more
after
the
closed
with
its
wondrous
and
mysterious
revelations
which
i
yet
recall
with
marveling
and
admiration
as
we
are
wont
to
do
a
pageant
of
the
past
until
aroused
from
lethargy
by
the
hand
and
voice
of
christian
garth
it
was
night
i
saw
the
glimmer
of
the
moonlight
on
the
seas
a
tranquil
balmy
night
but
some
dark
object
was
interposed
between
me
and
the
stars
which
i
knew
were
shining
above
and
the
raft
lay
motionless
upon
the
waters
i
was
aware
when
my
senses
returned
temporarily
that
the
bow
of
a
mighty
vessel
was
projected
above
our
frail
place
of
refuge
and
that
we
were
saved
the
dove
had
come
at
last
when
or
how
we
were
lifted
to
the
deck
of
the
ship
i
knew
not
for
having
partially
revived
i
soon
drifted
away
again
into
profound
lethargy
and
entire
unconsciousness
which
for
a
time
seemed
death
chapter
a
woman
sat
sewing
near
my
berth
in
the
in
which
i
found
myself
a
fan
lying
on
a
small
table
at
her
side
betokened
in
what
manner
she
had
divided
her
attentions
between
her
needle
and
her
helpless
charge
i
thought
indeed
that
i
had
felt
its
soft
plumes
glide
gently
across
my
face
in
the
very
moment
of
my
awakening
in
the
first
amazement
of
which
i
but
dimly
comprehended
the
circumstances
that
surrounded
me
what
brought
this
stranger
to
my
pillow
who
and
what
was
she
where
was
i
these
were
my
mental
queries
at
the
first
then
as
the
truth
gradually
dawned
over
my
sluggish
and
bewildered
brain
i
lay
quietly
revolving
matters
and
noticed
my
nurse
and
my
surroundings
with
the
close
yet
careless
observation
of
a
child
the
woman
on
whom
my
gaze
was
earliest
fixed
while
her
own
seemed
riveted
on
the
work
upon
her
knee
was
of
middle
age
or
beyond
it
of
medium
size
of
square
and
sturdy
make
and
homely
to
the
very
verge
of
ugliness
she
was
dressed
plainly
if
not
commonly
in
black
but
there
was
a
general
air
of
decency
about
her
that
seemed
to
place
her
beyond
the
sphere
of
servitude
she
wore
spectacles
set
in
frames
and
she
wore
her
hair
straight
back
behind
small
ears
and
gathered
into
the
tightest
knot
behind
her
head
was
flat
and
narrow
at
the
summit
though
broad
at
and
above
the
base
of
the
brain
her
forehead
wide
yet
low
was
ignoble
in
expression
the
mouth
shaped
like
a
horseshoe
was
curved
down
at
the
corners
and
was
full
of
sullen
resolution
the
nose
pinched
yet
not
pointed
showed
scarcely
any
nostril
and
might
as
well
have
been
made
of
wood
for
any
meaning
it
betrayed
her
eyebrows
were
short
wide
rugged
and
irregular
though
very
black
the
eyes
of
course
so
far
inscrutable
she
was
shaping
a
flimsy
dress
and
doing
it
deftly
though
it
was
a
marvel
to
me
how
hands
so
stiff
and
cramped
as
hers
appeared
to
be
could
handle
a
needle
at
all
on
one
of
these
gnarled
and
unlovely
fingers
she
wore
a
ring
which
in
the
idleness
of
the
mood
that
possessed
me
i
examined
listlessly
it
was
an
and
slender
circle
of
gold
so
pale
that
it
looked
silvery
such
as
in
times
long
past
had
commonly
been
used
either
for
or
surmounted
by
two
small
united
hearts
of
the
same
dull
metal
by
way
of
ornament
austin
i
remembered
possessed
one
the
aversion
of
my
childhood
that
seemed
its
counterpart
my
weary
eyes
wandered
from
her
at
last
to
take
in
the
accessories
of
my
chamber
tiny
as
this
was
and
i
saw
that
against
the
wall
were
hanging
a
gentleman
greatcoat
and
cigars
and
books
were
piled
on
the
same
table
which
held
the
spool
and
scissors
of
my
companion
and
a
pair
of
cloth
slippers
embroidered
with
colored
chenilles
and
quilted
lining
of
masculine
size
and
shape
reposed
upon
the
floor
a
cane
and
umbrella
were
secured
neatly
in
a
small
corner
rack
there
were
no
traces
i
saw
of
feminine
occupancy
beyond
the
transient
implements
of
industry
alluded
to
suddenly
in
their
languid
listless
roving
my
eyes
encountered
those
of
my
attendant
fixed
full
upon
me
while
a
smile
distorted
the
homely
sallow
face
disclosing
a
set
of
yellow
teeth
sound
short
and
strong
like
regular
grains
of
corn
in
those
eyes
in
that
mouth
and
saffron
teeth
lay
the
whole
power
and
character
of
this
repulsive
and
disagreeable
physiognomy
those
feline
orbs
of
mingled
gray
and
green
with
their
small
pointed
pupils
were
keen
vigilant
and
observing
beyond
all
eyes
it
had
ever
before
or
since
been
my
lot
to
encounter
after
meeting
their
penetrating
glance
i
was
not
surprised
to
hear
their
possessor
accost
me
in
clear
metallic
tones
that
seemed
only
the
result
of
her
gift
of
insight
and
consistent
with
it
you
are
awake
and
yourself
again
young
lady
i
am
glad
to
see
you
have
slept
very
quietly
for
the
last
few
hours
and
your
fever
is
wellnigh
broken
will
you
have
some
food
now
you
need
it
you
must
be
weak
yes
very
weak
but
not
hungry
at
all
i
do
not
want
to
eat
just
let
me
lie
quietly
awhile
it
is
such
enjoyment
she
complied
silently
and
judiciously
with
my
request
after
a
satisfactory
pause
during
which
i
had
gradually
collected
my
ideas
i
inquired
suddenly
how
long
is
it
since
we
were
lifted
from
the
raft
and
where
are
the
other
survivors
all
safe
i
believe
and
on
board
well
cared
for
like
yourself
it
has
been
nearly
two
days
since
your
raft
was
overhauled
this
was
what
the
captain
called
it
and
she
smiled
the
baby
where
is
he
i
hope
he
lived
yes
he
is
at
last
out
of
danger
and
we
have
obtained
a
nurse
for
him
he
would
only
trouble
you
now
but
it
is
very
natural
you
should
be
anxious
about
him
yes
he
was
my
principal
care
on
the
raft
and
i
do
not
wish
to
lose
sight
of
him
when
i
am
better
you
must
let
him
share
my
room
until
we
reach
our
friends
oh
certainly
and
again
she
smiled
her
evil
smile
no
one
so
far
as
i
know
of
has
any
right
or
wish
to
separate
you
but
for
the
present
you
are
better
alone
yes
i
am
strangely
weak
confused
even
and
i
passed
my
hand
over
my
blistered
face
and
dishevelled
hair
with
something
of
the
feeling
of
the
little
woman
in
the
story
who
doubted
her
own
identity
alas
there
was
not
even
a
familiar
dog
to
bark
and
determine
the
vexed
question
is
this
i
helpless
as
an
infant
flaccid
as
the
when
taken
from
its
native
element
feeble
in
mind
from
recent
suffering
broken
in
body
i
was
cast
on
the
mercies
of
strangers
ignorant
until
they
saw
me
of
my
existence
yet
not
indifferent
to
it
as
their
care
testified
you
will
take
some
food
now
said
the
woman
kindly
your
weakness
is
not
unfavorable
since
it
proves
the
fierce
fever
broken
but
you
must
hasten
to
gather
strength
for
what
lies
before
you
we
shall
be
in
port
i
put
away
the
spoon
with
an
impatient
gesture
i
can
not
it
nauseates
me
but
to
see
it
to
think
of
it
strength
will
come
of
itself
oh
no
that
is
impossible
besides
the
doctor
has
ordered
panada
and
i
am
responsible
to
him
for
your
safety
come
now
be
reasonable
this
is
very
nice
seasoned
with
madeira
and
nutmeg
making
a
strong
effort
to
overcome
my
repugnance
i
received
one
spoonful
of
the
proffered
aliment
then
sank
back
on
my
pillow
soothed
and
comforted
not
more
by
the
unexpectedly
good
effects
of
the
compound
than
the
associations
it
conjured
up
of
my
sick
childhood
of
austin
and
of
pemberton
ah
you
smile
that
is
a
good
sign
said
the
woman
favorable
every
way
we
shall
have
no
more
delirium
now
i
hope
no
more
and
serpents
about
the
berth
no
more
calls
for
and
wentworth
and
you
will
soon
be
able
to
tell
us
all
about
yourself
and
your
people
all
we
want
to
know
i
most
have
lapsed
again
into
reverie
rather
than
slumber
from
which
i
was
partly
aroused
by
whispering
voices
at
the
door
one
of
which
seemed
familiar
to
me
yet
this
fact
or
fancy
made
little
impression
on
me
at
the
moment
feeble
and
wretched
as
was
my
will
undiscriminating
as
were
my
faculties
and
when
the
door
opened
and
a
lady
entered
i
did
not
seek
to
inquire
about
her
interlocutor
respectfully
rising
from
her
seat
beside
me
my
companion
left
it
vacant
for
her
to
whom
she
introduced
me
as
her
mistress
and
stood
work
in
hand
sewing
beneath
the
skylight
while
the
remained
in
the
a
handsome
woman
tall
and
fashionably
attired
apparently
between
thirty
and
forty
years
of
age
square
faced
and
with
curling
hair
approached
me
with
uplifted
hands
and
eyebrows
as
i
lay
gazing
calmly
upon
her
for
my
food
and
slumber
together
had
strengthened
and
revived
me
wonderfully
in
the
last
few
hours
and
my
senses
were
again
collected
awake
and
herself
again
as
i
live
even
if
we
can
not
say
yet
truthfully
and
in
her
right
mind
eh
clayton
with
a
sneering
simper
and
what
eyes
what
teeth
to
be
sure
then
the
dreadful
redness
is
going
away
though
the
skin
will
scale
of
course
but
no
matter
for
that
all
the
fairer
in
the
end
and
what
a
special
mercy
that
her
hair
is
saved
you
have
to
thank
for
that
young
lady
i
would
not
let
the
ship
doctor
touch
a
strand
of
it
not
a
strand
does
not
grow
a
yard
and
a
half
of
hair
in
a
month
or
a
year
doctor
i
observed
a
woman
might
as
well
be
dead
at
once
or
mad
or
a
man
as
have
cropped
hair
during
all
the
days
of
her
youth
i
had
a
you
see
i
have
magnificent
hair
myself
child
as
clayton
well
knows
for
it
is
her
chief
trouble
on
earth
and
i
would
almost
as
lief
die
as
lose
it
yes
indeed
lady
anastasia
hair
is
one
of
her
chief
attractions
observed
the
sympathizing
clayton
behind
her
chair
so
sir
harry
raymond
thought
my
dear
addressing
me
when
i
married
him
ten
years
ago
and
so
somebody
else
thinks
just
now
for
i
am
tired
of
my
widowhood
and
intend
taking
on
the
conjugal
yoke
again
as
soon
as
i
reach
new
york
interpolated
clayton
hastily
and
emphatically
clearing
her
throat
slightly
by
way
of
apology
perhaps
for
her
officiousness
and
you
shall
stand
bridesmaid
my
dear
yes
i
am
determined
on
it
so
never
make
great
eyes
at
me
there
is
a
little
bit
of
romance
about
me
that
will
strike
out
in
spite
of
all
my
worldliness
and
it
will
be
so
pretty
to
have
an
for
an
attendant
it
will
read
so
well
in
the
papers
i
suppose
when
you
reach
your
friends
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
a
dress
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
meet
for
the
occasion
a
very
splendid
one
i
assure
you
conducted
without
regard
to
expense
for
my
is
very
rich
i
hear
and
my
own
jointure
was
a
liberal
one
you
do
me
a
great
honor
i
murmured
conventionally
rebelling
inwardly
at
the
suggestion
oh
not
at
all
was
the
gracious
rejoinder
i
see
at
a
glance
in
spite
of
your
misfortunes
that
you
are
one
of
us
which
is
not
what
i
say
to
everybody
true
blood
will
show
under
all
circumstances
though
there
is
such
an
improvement
did
any
one
ever
see
the
like
before
why
my
dear
you
were
blistered
and
black
when
we
picked
you
up
and
afterward
now
you
are
almost
a
beauty
i
am
better
much
better
and
have
a
great
deal
to
be
thankful
for
i
feel
i
contented
myself
with
murmuring
of
course
you
have
it
was
just
a
chance
with
you
between
our
ship
and
death
you
know
what
name
shall
we
give
our
miriam
for
the
present
if
you
please
this
is
no
time
nor
place
for
ceremony
well
miriam
it
shall
be
she
repeated
with
laughing
eyes
hers
were
of
that
sort
which
close
and
grow
chinese
under
the
pressure
of
merriment
and
high
cheekbones
combined
miriam
i
like
the
name
there
is
something
grand
about
it
but
how
shall
we
know
where
to
find
your
friends
when
we
get
to
port
asked
my
first
attendant
we
know
more
than
your
christian
name
for
such
a
purpose
you
must
place
confidence
in
us
you
must
indeed
be
patient
with
me
i
entreated
i
am
much
too
feeble
yet
to
give
you
the
details
that
may
be
necessary
when
we
reach
new
york
you
shall
know
every
thing
or
is
it
indeed
to
that
place
this
ship
is
bound
i
thought
you
knew
all
about
your
destination
by
this
time
replied
lady
anastasia
raymond
yes
yes
new
york
of
course
and
again
she
laughed
did
you
hear
clayton
say
so
just
then
a
sharp
tap
at
the
door
was
answered
by
lady
anastasia
who
went
quickly
from
beneath
the
curtain
hung
across
it
in
consideration
no
doubt
of
the
privacy
my
illness
enjoined
but
not
before
i
had
caught
once
and
this
time
clearly
the
tones
of
a
voice
that
thrilled
to
my
life
the
same
that
had
haunted
my
delirious
fancy
i
now
remembered
through
the
last
hours
i
rose
to
my
elbow
impulsively
only
to
fall
back
again
utterly
exhausted
who
was
that
speaking
i
asked
feebly
can
it
be
possible
and
i
wrung
my
hands
it
was
the
ship
doctor
interrupted
the
woman
i
had
heard
called
clayton
by
her
mistress
he
had
not
time
to
do
more
than
inquire
about
you
i
suppose
there
are
so
many
ill
in
the
steerage
but
he
has
been
very
kind
and
will
probably
return
i
hope
so
i
rejoined
i
should
like
to
realize
that
voice
as
it
has
haunted
me
very
disagreeably
in
my
dreams
and
the
tones
are
those
of
an
old
old
acquaintance
one
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
here
i
do
not
believe
you
have
an
acquaintance
on
the
ship
she
said
simply
under
the
circumstances
any
such
person
would
certainly
have
discovered
himself
your
situation
would
have
moved
a
heart
of
stone
but
it
is
sometimes
wise
for
the
wicked
to
lie
i
murmured
and
conjecture
was
busy
in
my
brain
i
should
be
glad
too
to
see
the
captain
of
this
vessel
at
his
earliest
convenience
i
added
after
a
pause
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
apprise
him
in
person
of
my
earnest
wish
it
would
be
a
real
charity
oh
certainly
but
i
am
afraid
he
can
not
come
it
is
nearly
evening
now
and
he
never
leaves
the
deck
at
this
hour
nor
until
very
late
then
i
must
insist
on
this
interview
since
i
reflect
about
it
for
several
reasons
he
shall
come
she
said
sententiously
and
now
try
and
sleep
again
it
is
very
necessary
you
should
gather
strength
for
we
shall
be
in
port
shortly
when
all
will
be
confusion
i
went
to
sleep
i
remember
murmuring
to
myself
the
hands
were
the
hands
of
jacob
but
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
esau
and
my
bewildered
faculties
found
rest
until
the
morning
dawn
after
a
hasty
toilet
made
by
the
careful
hands
of
clayton
a
matutinal
visit
made
by
or
lady
raymond
who
always
rose
early
as
she
informed
me
and
a
cup
of
tea
very
soothing
to
my
prostrated
nerves
the
potentate
of
the
latona
was
duly
announced
our
ship
master
was
a
tall
gaunt
man
with
steady
gray
eyes
hard
features
and
enormous
hands
and
feet
the
first
freckled
and
awkward
the
last
so
long
as
very
nearly
to
span
the
space
between
his
seat
a
small
trunk
and
the
berth
i
reposed
in
he
entered
without
his
hat
and
the
swoop
of
the
head
he
made
to
avoid
the
entanglement
of
the
curtain
was
supposed
to
do
double
duty
and
serve
as
a
bow
to
the
inmate
of
his
as
well
for
his
i
supposed
it
to
be
at
the
time
and
he
did
not
contradict
me
i
hope
you
find
yourself
comfortable
marm
on
board
of
my
ship
and
in
your
captain
i
interrupted
promptly
wall
you
see
it
all
belongs
to
me
kinder
he
said
after
seating
himself
as
he
rubbed
his
huge
projecting
knees
plainly
indicated
through
his
nankeen
trousers
with
his
capacious
horny
hands
i
not
very
particular
though
where
i
sleep
on
shipboard
but
at
home
few
more
so
i
thought
a
captain
was
more
at
home
on
shipboard
than
anywhere
else
i
pursued
mechanically
such
is
the
theory
at
least
oh
not
at
all
not
at
all
when
he
has
a
snug
nest
on
land
with
a
wife
and
children
waiting
to
receive
him
you
might
as
well
talk
of
a
man
in
the
new
settlements
bein
more
at
home
in
his
wagon
than
in
his
neat
cabin
a
very
good
simile
captain
and
one
that
kills
the
ancient
theory
outright
let
me
thank
you
however
before
we
proceed
further
for
all
the
kindness
and
attention
i
have
received
in
this
floating
castle
of
yours
both
from
you
and
others
i
hope
and
believe
that
my
companions
in
misfortune
have
fared
as
well
wall
they
have
not
wanted
for
nothing
as
far
as
i
knew
the
poor
baby
in
particular
and
as
he
spoke
he
roughed
his
hair
with
one
hand
and
smiled
into
my
face
a
huge
honest
gummy
smile
inexpressibly
reassuring
the
man
is
hideous
and
repulsive
i
thought
but
infinitely
preferable
somehow
to
the
specimen
of
english
aristocracy
and
her
maid
who
have
constituted
themselves
so
far
my
guardian
angels
a
twinge
of
ingratitude
here
which
i
resented
instantly
by
settling
my
patriotic
prejudices
to
be
at
the
root
of
the
thing
and
rebuking
my
mistrust
sternly
though
silently
yet
that
voice
how
could
i
be
mistaken
and
again
i
addressed
myself
to
the
task
before
me
having
gotten
through
all
preliminaries
while
i
sat
hesitating
as
to
what
i
should
say
so
as
to
both
guard
against
and
conceal
my
suspicions
from
the
captain
scrutiny
if
indeed
he
might
be
supposed
to
possess
such
a
quality
i
observed
that
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
long
slip
of
newspaper
in
which
he
appeared
to
bury
himself
for
a
time
when
not
glancing
furtively
at
me
as
if
waiting
impatiently
for
the
coming
revelation
i
have
sent
for
you
captain
van
dorne
i
said
at
last
in
very
low
and
even
tones
not
calculated
to
reach
outside
ears
however
vigilant
and
yet
not
suppressed
by
any
means
to
whispers
i
have
sent
for
you
and
my
heart
beat
quickly
as
i
spoke
not
merely
to
thank
you
for
your
hospitable
kindness
but
because
i
wish
for
reasons
that
i
can
not
now
explain
to
place
myself
under
your
especial
care
until
i
reach
my
friends
certainly
certainly
but
you
among
your
friends
already
if
you
could
only
think
so
he
answered
evasively
still
caressing
his
potato
knees
with
large
and
outspread
hands
do
not
for
one
moment
deem
me
unmindful
of
much
kindness
or
ungrateful
to
those
who
have
bestowed
it
i
hastened
to
explain
yet
i
can
not
deny
that
a
fear
possesses
me
that
among
your
passengers
may
be
found
one
whom
i
esteem
not
without
sufficient
cause
my
greatest
enemy
poor
thing
poor
thing
what
put
such
a
strange
fancy
into
your
head
an
enemy
in
my
ship
why
there
is
not
a
man
on
board
who
would
not
cut
off
his
right
hand
rather
than
harm
one
hair
of
your
poor
witless
defenseless
head
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
on
the
deck
when
you
and
the
rest
wuz
lifted
from
the
raft
i
understand
this
prevalence
of
sympathy
for
misfortune
perfectly
and
honor
it
yet
i
have
heard
a
voice
since
my
immurement
in
this
cabin
which
must
belong
and
i
whispered
the
dreaded
name
to
mr
basil
bainrothe
as
i
spoke
i
eyed
him
steadily
and
i
fancied
that
his
cheek
flushed
and
his
eye
wavered
that
clear
and
honest
eye
which
had
given
him
a
high
place
in
my
consideration
from
the
moment
i
met
its
gaze
you
must
have
been
when
you
conceited
you
heerd
that
strange
voice
he
said
presently
i
send
you
my
if
you
choose
and
you
can
read
it
over
keerfully
i
do
think
find
name
though
in
its
kolynms
shaking
his
head
sagaciously
captain
van
dorne
do
you
mean
to
say
there
is
no
such
passenger
in
your
ship
list
as
basil
bainrothe
i
asked
desperately
that
what
i
mean
to
say
give
me
your
honor
on
this
point
it
is
a
vital
one
to
me
your
honor
he
hesitated
and
looked
around
just
at
this
moment
of
apparent
uncertainty
a
slight
tap
was
heard
on
the
eye
above
us
that
threw
a
sullen
and
unwilling
light
upon
the
scene
of
our
interview
it
seemed
to
nerve
him
strangely
on
my
word
of
honor
as
an
american
seaman
i
assure
you
that
the
name
of
basil
bainrothe
is
not
on
the
ship
list
at
this
present
speaking
and
as
he
spoke
he
held
up
his
right
hand
adding
as
he
dropped
it
doggedly
ef
the
man
on
board
i
do
know
it
it
is
enough
i
believe
you
captain
van
dorne
and
now
i
want
to
ask
you
as
a
parting
grace
to
convey
me
yourself
to
the
astor
house
and
place
my
watch
detaching
it
from
my
neck
as
i
spoke
in
the
hands
of
the
proprietors
as
a
proof
of
my
honest
intentions
for
yourself
i
shall
seek
another
opportunity
not
at
all
not
at
all
he
interrupted
keep
your
watch
young
lady
no
such
pledge
will
be
required
by
them
proprietors
and
as
to
myself
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
paper
drawing
from
his
pocket
and
flattening
on
his
knees
as
he
spoke
the
slip
i
had
before
observed
then
glancing
at
me
sharply
i
could
never
have
believed
that
such
a
young
creetur
could
have
been
but
pshaw
what
am
i
talking
about
this
paper
is
as
old
as
last
krout
you
do
keer
nothing
about
seeing
of
it
do
you
now
and
he
crumpled
it
in
his
hand
not
unless
it
concerns
me
in
some
way
captain
van
dorne
i
said
coldly
his
manner
had
suddenly
become
offensive
to
me
and
i
longed
to
see
him
depart
having
transacted
my
affairs
as
far
at
least
as
i
deemed
it
prudent
to
insist
on
such
transaction
it
may
be
i
added
that
on
reaching
the
port
of
new
york
a
friend
or
friends
who
expected
me
on
the
kosciusko
may
be
in
waiting
to
receive
me
that
is
if
the
fate
of
that
vessel
be
not
already
known
in
that
case
i
shall
not
be
obliged
to
avail
myself
of
your
services
and
will
acquaint
you
but
otherwise
promise
that
you
will
conduct
me
from
the
ship
yourself
either
to
the
hotel
or
to
your
wife
as
you
prefer
wall
i
promise
you
he
said
doggedly
as
he
prepared
literally
to
undouble
his
long
frame
before
executing
another
dive
beneath
my
drapery
and
with
this
brief
assurance
i
was
fain
to
rest
content
at
all
events
i
was
reassured
on
one
subject
those
honest
eyes
that
frank
if
ugly
mouth
had
no
acquaintance
with
lies
or
the
father
of
them
i
saw
at
once
and
the
voice
of
the
ship
doctor
had
for
the
nonce
deceived
my
practised
ear
overstrung
by
suspicion
enfeebled
by
suffering
so
i
rested
calmly
until
the
afternoon
with
clayton
sewing
silently
by
my
side
when
with
a
little
tap
lady
anastasia
or
raymond
as
she
declared
she
preferred
to
be
called
by
americans
entered
bearing
a
basket
in
her
hand
and
wearing
on
her
head
a
dunstable
bonnet
simply
trimmed
which
she
came
she
said
to
place
along
with
other
articles
of
dress
at
my
disposal
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
that
in
order
to
go
on
shore
respectably
clad
some
attire
very
different
from
a
would
be
essential
and
i
could
but
feel
grateful
for
such
proofs
of
unselfish
consideration
on
the
part
of
strangers
pitying
both
my
indigence
and
imbecility
and
so
expressed
myself
in
accordance
with
their
generous
intentions
i
submitted
myself
to
be
arrayed
by
clayton
and
her
mistress
first
in
the
flimsy
black
silk
gown
now
completed
on
which
i
had
seen
my
attendant
working
when
i
first
unclosed
my
eyes
after
long
unconsciousness
and
the
measure
of
which
she
had
taken
while
i
lay
in
this
condition
as
coolly
in
all
probability
as
an
undertaker
measures
a
corpse
for
its
shroud
secondly
in
a
cardinal
of
the
same
material
a
wrapping
cut
in
the
shape
in
vogue
at
that
period
thirdly
in
certain
boots
and
gloves
with
which
i
was
fain
to
cover
up
my
naked
feet
and
blistered
hands
forma
and
lastly
in
the
collarette
and
cuffs
provided
by
the
economic
and
considerate
lady
anastasia
composed
of
cotton
lace
the
dunstable
bonnet
was
hung
upon
a
peg
in
readiness
and
i
was
kindly
counseled
to
lie
still
accoutred
as
i
was
and
exhausted
by
means
of
such
accoutrement
as
i
felt
until
evening
should
find
us
riding
in
our
harbor
then
there
was
a
little
low
consulting
at
the
door
with
the
renowned
ship
doctor
who
positively
refused
to
approach
me
because
he
had
just
come
from
a
case
of
in
the
steerage
which
he
feared
to
communicate
to
one
in
my
precarious
state
but
who
sent
in
his
imperative
orders
that
i
should
have
soup
and
forthwith
and
try
and
build
up
my
strength
for
the
time
of
debarkation
speaking
in
a
low
growling
voice
divested
of
its
former
clearness
but
still
strangely
resembling
that
of
basil
bainrothe
the
poor
man
is
so
fagged
out
said
clayton
as
she
brought
in
my
broth
and
wine
that
his
very
voice
is
changed
he
is
a
good
soul
and
has
shown
you
great
interest
some
day
you
must
send
him
a
present
that
is
if
you
are
able
but
just
now
all
you
have
to
think
of
is
getting
safe
ashore
lady
anastasia
will
go
to
her
friends
probably
or
to
those
of
the
gentleman
she
is
engaged
to
but
i
do
not
mean
to
forsake
you
until
i
see
you
better
and
in
good
hands
i
know
not
how
it
was
that
my
heart
sank
so
strangely
at
this
announcement
the
woman
was
kind
tender
even
and
had
probably
saved
my
life
and
yet
her
presence
to
me
was
a
punishment
worse
than
pain
a
positive
evil
greater
than
any
other
i
shall
go
to
the
astor
house
i
faltered
the
captain
has
promised
me
his
escort
thither
yes
yes
i
know
he
has
told
me
all
about
it
but
your
friends
may
not
be
in
waiting
and
it
is
simply
our
duty
to
see
you
in
their
hands
and
now
drink
your
sangaree
see
i
have
broken
a
biscuit
in
the
glass
and
it
is
well
seasoned
with
lemon
and
nutmeg
there
now
that
is
right
a
few
spoonfuls
of
soup
and
you
will
feel
strengthened
for
your
undertaking
i
will
sit
quietly
in
the
corner
until
you
have
your
rest
no
i
prefer
to
see
christian
garth
before
i
try
to
sleep
the
man
who
steered
our
raft
and
the
young
girl
he
saved
and
the
baby
let
them
all
come
to
me
and
we
will
go
on
shore
together
i
spoke
these
words
with
a
sort
of
desperation
as
though
they
contained
my
last
hope
of
justice
or
protection
from
a
fate
which
however
obscurely
seemed
to
threaten
me
as
we
feel
the
brooding
in
the
tranquil
atmosphere
of
summer
christian
garth
she
repeated
looking
at
me
over
her
spectacles
and
quietly
drawing
out
a
snuffbox
of
the
same
material
she
proceeded
to
fill
her
narrow
nostrils
therewith
why
that
old
sailor
and
the
girl
and
the
old
negro
woman
and
child
went
on
shore
at
daylight
this
morning
he
hailed
a
jersey
craft
and
they
all
left
together
it
is
perfectly
understood
though
that
the
child
is
to
be
returned
to
you
if
you
desire
its
company
but
if
i
were
situated
as
you
are
and
sure
of
its
safety
i
would
never
want
to
see
it
again
it
would
be
better
off
dead
than
living
anyhow
under
the
circumstances
poor
deformed
creature
better
for
both
of
you
the
words
came
to
me
distinctly
yet
as
if
from
an
immense
distance
and
i
seemed
to
see
the
small
chamber
lengthening
as
if
it
had
been
a
telescope
unfolding
and
the
sallow
woman
with
her
hateful
smile
and
brindled
hair
seated
in
diminished
size
and
distinctness
at
its
farthest
extremity
so
had
i
felt
on
that
fearful
night
when
evelyn
had
made
her
revelation
and
received
mine
and
i
did
not
doubt
even
in
my
sinking
state
that
i
was
under
the
influence
of
a
powerful
anodyne
call
the
ship
doctor
i
am
dying
were
the
last
words
i
remember
to
have
articulated
then
all
was
dark
and
hours
went
by
of
deep
unconscious
sleep
it
was
night
when
i
felt
myself
drawn
to
my
feet
and
roused
to
life
by
the
repeated
applications
of
cold
water
to
my
face
the
anodyne
was
i
heard
raymond
say
it
is
a
shame
to
tamper
with
such
strong
medicines
oh
she
has
strength
for
any
thing
was
clayton
rejoinder
i
never
saw
such
a
constitution
and
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
no
doubt
of
but
dear
miss
miriam
do
speak
to
me
i
am
so
frightened
at
your
lethargic
i
declare
i
am
sorry
i
ever
consented
to
have
any
thing
to
do
with
this
matter
see
how
she
stands
i
can
not
think
it
was
right
clayton
i
can
not
indeed
i
dislike
the
whole
drama
do
be
quiet
she
is
coming
to
herself
fast
and
what
will
she
think
of
such
expressions
you
never
had
any
in
your
life
and
you
are
playing
for
great
stakes
now
these
last
words
in
a
hoarse
whisper
nonsense
mother
again
how
often
must
i
warn
you
well
clayton
then
now
and
forever
here
rouse
up
little
one
we
are
fast
anchored
in
port
and
the
captain
is
waiting
for
us
for
we
go
part
of
the
way
together
and
our
escorts
have
all
failed
us
yours
and
mine
nice
fellows
are
they
not
i
sat
up
and
looked
about
me
bewildered
yet
i
had
heard
distinctly
every
word
spoken
in
the
last
few
minutes
and
remembered
them
for
future
observance
without
having
had
the
power
to
move
or
articulate
a
remonstrance
now
drink
this
strong
coffee
and
all
will
be
well
again
said
clayton
putting
a
cup
of
the
smoking
beverage
to
my
lips
which
i
swallowed
eagerly
instinctively
the
effect
was
instantaneous
and
i
was
able
to
speak
and
stand
as
well
as
hear
and
comprehend
while
my
bonnet
was
being
tied
on
and
my
throat
muffled
in
a
veil
by
the
dexterous
fingers
of
lady
anastasia
when
this
process
was
completed
she
stooped
down
and
kissed
me
and
i
felt
a
hot
tear
fall
upon
my
cheek
as
she
rose
again
in
the
next
moment
i
was
clinging
to
the
captain
arm
with
a
spasmodic
feeling
of
relief
for
which
i
could
ill
account
we
passed
across
the
plank
which
connected
the
ship
with
the
shore
in
utter
darkness
guided
by
a
twinkling
light
far
ahead
borne
by
a
seaman
reached
the
dusky
quay
with
its
few
flaring
lamps
made
dim
by
drizzling
rain
and
summer
mist
and
before
many
minutes
we
paused
before
one
of
a
long
line
of
coaches
the
captain
handed
me
in
then
standing
before
the
open
door
seemed
to
await
the
coming
of
some
other
person
before
taking
his
own
place
the
dreaded
clayton
i
knew
but
i
could
not
remonstrate
against
what
seemed
an
ordinary
courtesy
and
perhaps
a
step
suggested
by
his
innate
notions
of
propriety
at
any
other
time
i
might
have
agreed
with
him
but
feeble
as
i
was
and
still
bewildered
my
whole
object
seemed
to
be
to
escape
from
the
sphere
and
power
of
those
women
who
had
been
most
kind
to
me
yet
whom
i
instinctively
dreaded
and
abhorred
they
came
together
the
mother
and
daughter
in
their
travesty
of
mistress
and
maid
enough
of
itself
to
excite
suspicion
of
foul
play
and
climbed
up
the
rickety
steps
of
the
rejoicing
over
their
victim
it
mattered
not
the
captain
would
make
the
fourth
passenger
and
in
his
shadow
i
felt
there
were
strength
and
security
what
are
you
waiting
for
captain
van
dorne
i
had
just
feebly
asked
as
the
door
and
the
driver
mounted
his
box
a
hand
was
thrust
through
the
window
for
all
reply
and
a
card
dropped
upon
my
lap
which
i
hastened
to
secure
in
the
depths
of
my
pocket
by
the
merest
chance
i
found
it
there
on
the
morrow
and
later
i
comprehended
its
import
so
mysterious
to
me
at
the
moment
of
perusal
my
poor
young
lady
you
must
forgive
me
for
disappointing
you
and
hidin
the
truth
for
your
own
sake
may
god
bless
and
restore
you
and
bring
you
to
a
proper
sense
of
his
mercies
is
the
prayer
of
your
servant
to
command
joseph
van
dorne
my
frame
of
mind
was
a
very
different
one
when
i
read
this
scrawl
from
that
which
bewildered
and
oppressed
me
on
that
night
of
suffering
and
distress
both
mental
and
physical
formed
of
those
elements
which
readily
react
courage
and
calmness
had
returned
to
me
before
i
read
the
oracle
of
our
worthy
shipmaster
for
in
spite
of
his
disastrous
dealing
with
me
on
that
occasion
misguided
as
he
was
by
others
i
have
reason
to
so
consider
him
but
now
the
influence
of
the
drug
that
had
been
given
me
so
recently
doubtless
through
want
of
judgment
by
the
ship
doctor
was
felt
in
every
nerve
and
as
the
carriage
rolled
up
the
stony
quay
i
clung
convulsively
to
raymond
and
buried
my
face
and
aching
forehead
in
her
shoulder
with
a
strange
revulsion
of
feeling
you
dread
the
darkness
she
said
kindly
putting
her
arm
around
me
as
she
spoke
but
it
is
only
for
a
time
we
shall
soon
come
out
into
the
open
lamplight
of
broadway
new
york
interrupted
clayton
sententiously
a
very
poor
sight
to
see
to
one
who
has
lived
abroad
have
you
ever
crossed
the
waters
miss
miriam
but
i
see
you
are
quite
faint
and
overcome
here
smell
this
ether
that
the
ship
doctor
put
up
expressly
for
your
use
and
recommended
highly
as
a
new
restorative
much
in
fashion
in
paris
had
the
ship
doctor
no
name
then
that
they
never
mentioned
it
and
that
he
spoke
in
a
demon
voice
his
doses
i
had
proved
and
was
resolved
to
take
no
more
of
them
and
i
pushed
away
the
phial
whose
cold
glass
nose
was
thrust
obtrusively
against
my
own
pushed
it
away
with
all
my
strength
fast
ebbing
away
as
this
was
even
as
i
made
the
effort
the
cruel
potion
had
possession
of
me
and
entered
into
every
fibre
of
my
brain
through
the
avenues
prepared
for
it
by
the
treacherous
anodyne
so
that
enervated
and
intoxicated
i
yielded
passively
after
a
brief
struggle
to
the
power
of
the
then
sedative
called
chloroform
when
the
carriage
stopped
or
whither
it
transported
me
or
who
lifted
my
insensible
form
to
the
chamber
prepared
for
me
i
know
not
never
knew
there
was
a
faint
reviving
i
remember
a
process
of
disrobing
gone
through
by
the
aid
of
foreign
assistance
whose
i
recognized
not
then
i
slumbered
profoundly
and
securely
through
the
entire
night
to
recover
no
clearness
of
perception
until
a
late
hour
on
the
following
morning
chapter
vi
i
awoke
as
i
had
done
of
old
after
one
of
my
lethargic
seizures
from
a
deep
unrefreshing
slumber
with
a
lingering
sense
about
me
of
drowsiness
and
even
fatigue
i
found
myself
lying
on
a
broad
canopied
bedstead
the
massive
posts
of
which
were
of
wrought
rosewood
bare
of
draperies
as
became
the
season
save
at
the
behind
which
a
heavy
curtain
was
dropped
of
damask
satin
of
the
same
rich
material
were
composed
the
tester
and
the
coverlet
thrown
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
over
a
fine
white
marseilles
counterpane
the
chimney
immediately
opposite
to
me
as
i
lay
was
of
black
marble
and
instead
of
graceful
greek
bandaged
mummies
or
egyptian
figures
supported
the
heavy
shelf
that
surmounted
the
polished
grate
in
the
centre
of
this
massive
was
placed
a
huge
bronze
clock
and
candelabra
of
the
same
material
graced
its
corners
in
either
recess
of
this
chimney
rosewood
doors
were
situated
one
of
which
stood
invitingly
ajar
disclosing
the
into
which
it
opened
with
its
accessories
of
white
marble
the
other
firmly
closed
seemed
to
be
the
outlet
of
the
chamber
its
only
one
with
the
exception
of
the
four
large
venetian
windows
two
on
either
side
of
me
as
i
lay
the
sashes
of
which
warm
as
the
season
was
were
drawn
closely
down
the
furniture
of
this
spacious
chamber
to
which
as
if
by
the
touch
of
a
magician
wand
i
found
myself
transported
was
throughout
solid
and
of
elegant
forms
consisting
as
it
did
of
bookcase
writing
and
flower
stands
tables
and
chairs
of
the
richest
rosewood
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
was
placed
a
console
supporting
a
huge
bible
and
bound
alike
in
purple
velvet
emblazoned
with
central
suns
of
gold
an
that
was
not
lost
on
its
object
flowers
were
heaped
in
the
vases
of
the
floral
stands
filling
the
close
cool
room
with
an
overpowering
fragrance
the
carpet
of
crimson
and
white
seemed
to
the
eye
what
it
afterward
proved
to
the
foot
thick
soft
and
elastic
and
harmonized
well
with
the
rich
antique
and
consistent
furniture
the
sort
of
microscopic
scrutiny
that
children
manifest
seemed
mine
in
my
unreasoning
state
and
for
a
time
i
observed
all
that
i
have
described
with
a
listless
pleasure
difficult
to
analyze
a
sort
of
dreamy
acceptance
of
my
condition
the
very
memory
of
which
exasperated
me
later
almost
to
a
crimson
cord
hung
at
one
side
of
my
bed
continued
from
a
at
some
distance
the
tassel
of
which
i
touched
lightly
and
at
the
very
first
signal
clayton
appeared
through
the
hitherto
only
unopened
door
to
know
and
do
my
bidding
the
clock
on
the
struck
nine
as
she
stood
beside
me
and
made
respectful
inquiries
concerning
my
wants
and
condition
understanding
which
she
disappeared
to
return
a
few
minutes
later
followed
by
an
ancient
negress
bearing
a
silver
waiter
i
recognized
in
this
sable
assistant
or
thought
i
recognized
at
a
glance
my
companion
in
shipwreck
but
upon
making
known
my
convictions
was
met
with
a
prompt
denial
by
the
sable
dame
herself
who
shaking
her
head
gave
me
to
understand
in
a
few
broken
words
that
she
no
understood
english
only
spanish
tongue
her
dress
handsome
and
frenchified
her
creole
coiffure
and
the
long
gray
locks
that
escaped
from
her
crimson
kerchief
bound
over
her
ears
as
well
as
her
more
refined
deportment
did
indeed
seem
to
discredit
my
first
idea
which
came
at
last
notwithstanding
these
discrepancies
to
be
fixed
and
proved
one
link
in
the
long
chain
of
duplicity
i
untangled
later
at
the
time
however
i
gave
it
little
thought
but
partook
with
what
appetite
i
might
of
the
choice
and
delicate
repast
provided
for
me
in
this
truly
princely
hotel
whose
fame
i
discovered
had
not
been
over
trumpeted
on
my
previous
visits
to
new
york
the
astor
house
had
been
unfinished
and
had
made
in
its
completion
a
new
era
certainly
in
the
of
that
inhospitable
city
of
publicans
when
the
delicious
coffee
and
snowy
bread
the
eggs
of
milky
freshness
the
golden
butter
the
savory
the
appetizing
fish
had
each
and
all
been
merely
tasted
and
dismissed
and
the
exquisite
china
in
which
the
breakfast
was
served
duly
marveled
at
as
an
unprecedented
extravagance
on
the
part
even
of
john
jacob
astor
clayton
came
to
me
with
kindly
offers
of
assistance
in
the
performance
of
my
toilet
still
a
matter
of
difficulty
in
my
feeble
hands
my
long
hair
yet
tangled
and
clogged
with
was
to
be
at
last
unbound
and
thoroughly
combed
cleansed
and
oiled
so
that
the
black
and
glossy
braids
that
had
been
my
chief
personal
pride
might
again
be
wound
about
my
head
in
the
old
classic
fashion
then
came
the
bath
with
its
reviving
rehabilitating
process
and
lastly
i
assumed
with
the
docility
of
a
baby
or
a
pauper
the
clean
and
fragrant
linen
and
simple
wrapper
that
had
been
mysteriously
provided
for
me
by
the
lady
anastasia
again
i
could
not
doubt
all
this
must
end
i
said
when
really
clothed
and
in
my
right
mind
i
requested
and
more
light
to
work
by
and
composed
myself
to
write
to
pemberton
once
again
i
knew
in
philadelphia
and
request
his
assistance
and
protection
in
getting
home
safely
and
if
need
be
in
tracing
captain
wentworth
i
suppose
captain
van
dorne
has
been
too
busy
to
call
i
observed
carelessly
as
i
prepared
to
commence
my
letter
and
raymond
too
happy
probably
in
getting
safe
to
shore
and
her
lover
to
think
of
me
they
have
both
inquired
for
you
said
clayton
as
she
arranged
pen
ink
and
paper
before
me
with
her
usual
precision
while
a
grim
sardonic
smile
lingered
about
her
features
several
have
called
but
none
have
been
admitted
who
have
called
clayton
give
me
the
cards
immediately
i
must
must
know
i
rejoined
eagerly
pausing
with
extended
hand
to
receive
them
oh
there
were
no
cards
and
such
as
want
to
see
you
can
come
again
there
now
write
away
and
never
trouble
your
mind
about
strange
people
have
you
sufficient
light
and
as
she
spoke
she
touched
a
cord
which
set
at
right
angles
with
the
lower
one
the
upper
inside
shutter
of
another
window
as
she
had
adjusted
the
first
i
wrote
two
hasty
notes
one
on
further
consideration
to
captain
wentworth
himself
who
might
after
all
be
at
that
very
time
in
that
same
hotel
as
favraud
used
to
say
with
his
significant
shrug
which
no
frenchman
ever
excelled
or
spaniard
equalled
albeit
they
shrug
severally
my
spirits
rose
with
every
word
i
wrote
and
when
i
got
up
from
my
chair
after
sealing
and
directing
my
letters
a
new
and
subtle
energy
seemed
to
have
infused
itself
through
my
frame
there
i
have
finished
clayton
i
said
putting
aside
the
implements
i
had
been
using
now
go
if
you
please
and
bring
to
me
the
proprietor
of
this
hotel
i
will
give
him
my
letters
myself
since
i
have
other
business
to
transact
with
him
and
i
laid
my
watch
and
chain
on
the
table
before
me
ready
for
his
hand
not
having
lost
sight
of
my
early
resolution
but
stay
before
you
go
be
good
enough
to
open
the
lower
shutters
and
throw
up
the
windows
cool
as
the
weather
is
in
this
climate
i
stifle
for
air
and
this
close
atmosphere
laden
with
fragrance
grows
oppressive
who
sent
these
flowers
clayton
or
do
they
belong
to
the
magnificence
of
this
idealized
hotel
she
made
no
reply
to
any
thing
i
had
been
saying
by
this
time
however
she
had
lowered
the
upper
sashes
of
the
windows
about
a
foot
and
the
fresh
air
of
morning
was
pouring
in
curling
the
paper
on
the
centre
table
and
dispersing
the
noisome
fragrance
of
the
flowers
in
which
i
detected
the
morbid
supremacy
of
the
tuberose
and
jasmine
i
want
to
see
the
streets
the
people
i
said
approaching
one
of
the
windows
this
artistic
light
is
not
at
all
the
thing
i
need
i
have
no
picture
to
paint
not
even
my
own
face
and
finding
her
unmoved
i
undertook
to
do
the
requisite
work
myself
the
sashes
were
shut
away
below
by
inside
shutters
which
resisted
all
my
efforts
to
stir
them
after
a
moment
inspection
i
perceived
that
they
were
secured
by
iron
screws
of
great
strength
and
size
not
in
short
meant
to
be
moved
or
opened
at
all
again
i
essayed
to
shake
them
convulsively
one
after
the
other
as
you
may
sometimes
see
a
tiger
made
desperate
by
confinement
grapple
with
the
inexorable
bars
of
his
cage
though
certain
of
failure
and
defeat
overpowered
by
a
sudden
dismay
that
took
entire
possession
of
me
i
sank
into
one
of
the
deep
that
extended
its
arms
very
opportunely
to
receive
me
and
sat
mutely
for
a
moment
while
anguish
unutterable
and
conjecture
too
wild
to
be
hazarded
in
speech
were
surging
through
my
brain
i
am
too
weak
i
suppose
to
open
these
shutters
i
said
at
last
feebly
be
good
enough
to
do
it
for
me
clayton
or
cause
it
to
be
done
immediately
was
it
not
strange
that
up
to
this
very
moment
no
suspicion
had
clouded
my
horizon
since
i
woke
in
that
sumptuous
room
i
can
not
transcend
my
orders
by
doing
any
thing
of
the
kind
she
said
quietly
yet
resolutely
as
she
pursued
her
avocation
that
of
dusting
with
a
bunch
of
colored
plumes
the
delicate
ornaments
of
the
carefully
one
by
one
your
authority
who
has
dared
to
delegate
to
you
what
has
no
existence
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
asked
indignantly
i
will
go
instantly
you
can
not
leave
this
chamber
until
you
receive
outside
permission
she
interrupted
firmly
planting
herself
at
once
between
me
and
the
door
through
which
i
had
seen
her
enter
you
must
not
think
to
pass
through
my
chamber
miss
miriam
it
is
locked
without
and
there
is
no
other
outlet
woman
i
said
grasping
her
feebly
yet
fiercely
by
the
arm
look
at
me
raise
those
feline
eyes
to
mine
if
you
dare
and
answer
me
truthfully
what
means
this
mockery
why
have
you
been
forced
on
me
at
all
where
is
captain
van
dorne
what
becomes
of
his
promises
what
house
is
this
in
which
i
find
myself
a
prisoner
speak
you
can
do
nothing
to
make
me
angry
she
rejoined
calmly
i
know
your
condition
and
pity
and
respect
it
but
i
shall
certainly
fulfill
my
part
of
this
undertaking
captain
van
dorne
recognized
you
as
miss
monfort
by
the
description
in
the
newspaper
as
did
my
mistress
and
for
your
own
welfare
we
determined
to
secure
you
and
keep
you
safe
until
the
return
of
bainrothe
and
your
sisters
from
europe
they
will
be
here
shortly
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
be
patient
and
behave
as
well
as
you
can
until
the
time
comes
for
your
trial
and
she
cast
on
me
a
menacing
look
from
her
green
and
quivering
pupils
indescribably
feline
my
trial
great
heaven
did
they
mean
to
turn
the
tables
then
and
destroy
me
by
anticipating
my
evidence
i
staggered
to
a
chair
and
again
sat
down
silent
confounded
where
am
i
then
i
feebly
asked
at
length
in
the
establishment
of
englehart
she
made
answer
a
private
madhouse
god
of
heaven
has
it
come
to
this
i
covered
my
eyes
with
my
hands
and
sobbed
aloud
while
tears
of
pride
and
passion
rained
hotly
over
my
cheeks
this
outburst
was
of
short
duration
i
will
give
them
no
advantage
i
considered
my
violence
might
be
perverted
there
are
creatures
too
cold
and
crafty
to
conceive
of
such
a
thing
as
natural
emotion
and
passion
with
them
means
insanity
thank
god
the
very
power
to
feel
bears
with
it
the
power
of
and
is
proof
of
reason
i
will
be
calm
and
if
my
life
endures
put
them
thus
to
shame
you
say
that
i
am
in
the
asylum
of
dr
englehart
i
asked
after
a
pause
during
which
she
had
not
ceased
to
dust
the
furniture
and
arrange
the
bed
in
its
pristine
order
speckless
with
smooth
as
glass
and
sheets
of
lawn
and
counterpane
of
snow
if
so
call
my
physician
hither
i
his
patient
have
surely
a
right
to
his
prompt
services
it
is
just
possible
i
thought
that
interest
or
compassion
may
one
or
both
still
enlist
him
in
my
cause
i
can
but
try
a
slight
embarrassment
was
evidenced
in
her
countenance
as
i
made
this
request
it
vanished
speedily
he
is
absent
just
at
this
time
she
answered
quickly
when
he
returns
i
will
make
known
your
wish
to
him
if
indeed
he
does
not
call
of
his
own
accord
be
done
with
this
shallow
farce
i
exclaimed
harshly
it
shames
humanity
acknowledge
yourself
at
once
the
faithful
agent
of
a
tyrant
and
felon
or
a
pair
of
them
and
i
shall
respect
you
more
confess
that
it
was
the
voice
of
basil
bainrothe
i
heard
at
my
and
that
captain
van
dorne
was
imposed
upon
by
that
specious
scoundrel
even
to
the
point
of
being
conscientiously
compelled
to
falsehood
i
deny
nothing
i
acknowledge
nothing
she
said
deliberately
you
and
your
friends
can
settle
this
between
yourselves
when
they
arrive
until
then
you
need
not
seek
to
tamper
with
me
it
will
be
useless
and
i
hope
you
are
too
much
of
a
lady
to
be
insulting
to
a
person
who
has
no
choice
but
to
do
her
duty
she
could
not
more
effectually
have
silenced
me
nor
more
utterly
have
crushed
my
hopes
yet
again
i
approached
her
with
entreaties
i
hope
you
will
not
refuse
to
mail
my
notes
even
under
these
trying
circumstances
i
said
extending
them
to
her
you
can
ask
englehart
to
do
so
when
he
comes
he
answered
gently
for
myself
i
am
utterly
powerless
to
serve
you
beyond
the
walls
of
this
chamber
and
how
long
is
this
close
immurement
to
continue
i
asked
again
after
another
dreary
pause
am
i
not
permitted
to
breathe
the
external
air
to
exercise
is
my
health
to
be
unconsidered
i
know
nothing
more
than
i
have
told
you
she
replied
i
am
directed
to
furnish
you
with
every
means
of
comfort
with
books
flowers
clothing
musical
instrument
even
if
you
desire
it
but
for
the
present
you
will
not
leave
these
walls
and
you
will
see
no
society
the
doctor
has
decided
that
this
is
best
and
whence
did
he
derive
his
authority
oh
it
was
all
arranged
between
him
and
bainrothe
your
guardeen
for
thus
she
pronounced
this
word
ever
hateful
to
me
long
ago
before
he
went
to
france
i
suppose
captain
van
dorne
had
nothing
to
do
but
hand
you
over
captain
van
dorne
to
think
those
honest
eyes
could
so
deceive
me
and
i
shook
my
head
wofully
when
i
looked
up
again
from
reverie
clayton
had
settled
herself
to
work
with
a
basket
of
stockings
on
her
knees
which
she
appeared
to
be
assorting
assiduously
there
she
sat
spectacles
on
nose
thimble
on
twisted
finger
in
hand
in
active
preparation
for
that
work
woman
that
alone
rivals
penelope
surely
that
assortment
of
yellow
and
holey
hose
was
a
treasure
to
her
that
no
gold
could
have
replaced
in
our
dreary
solitude
none
the
less
dreary
for
being
so
luxurious
i
envied
her
almost
the
power
she
seemed
to
have
to
merge
her
mind
in
things
like
these
and
saw
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
what
advantages
might
lie
in
being
commonplace
it
was
now
nearly
the
end
of
july
my
birthday
occurred
in
the
middle
of
september
i
thought
i
knew
that
as
soon
as
possible
after
my
majority
bainrothe
conditions
would
be
laid
before
me
i
could
not
dared
not
believe
that
my
captivity
would
be
lengthened
beyond
that
time
i
resolved
that
i
would
condone
the
past
and
go
forth
penniless
if
this
were
exacted
in
exchange
for
liberty
at
the
end
of
a
month
and
a
half
from
this
time
six
weeks
to
wait
were
they
not
in
the
fullness
of
their
power
to
crush
and
baffle
me
six
weary
years
for
during
all
this
time
i
felt
that
the
unexplained
mystery
that
weighed
upon
my
life
would
gather
in
force
and
inflexibility
death
would
have
seemed
to
have
set
its
seal
upon
it
in
the
estimation
of
captain
wentworth
as
of
all
others
he
would
never
know
that
the
sea
which
swallowed
up
the
kosciusko
had
spared
the
woman
he
loved
nor
receive
the
explanation
that
she
alone
could
give
him
of
the
mystery
he
deplored
before
i
emerged
from
my
prison
he
might
be
gone
to
the
antipodes
for
aught
i
knew
and
a
barrier
of
eternal
silence
and
absence
be
interposed
between
us
so
worked
my
fate
these
reflections
continued
to
haunt
and
oppress
me
by
night
and
day
and
life
itself
seemed
a
bitter
burden
in
that
interval
of
rebellious
agony
and
in
that
terrible
seclusion
where
luxury
itself
became
an
additional
engine
of
torture
days
passed
alternately
of
leaden
apathy
and
bitter
gloom
varied
by
irrepressible
paroxysms
of
despair
whenever
i
found
myself
alone
even
for
a
few
moments
i
paced
my
room
and
wept
aloud
or
prayed
passionately
there
were
times
when
i
felt
that
my
creator
heard
and
pitied
me
others
when
i
persuaded
myself
his
ear
was
closed
inexorably
against
me
i
suffered
fearfully
this
could
not
last
the
accusation
brought
against
me
by
my
enemies
seemed
almost
ready
to
be
realized
when
my
body
magnanimously
assumed
the
penalty
the
soul
was
perhaps
about
to
pay
and
drifted
off
to
fever
then
for
the
first
time
came
the
man
i
had
until
then
believed
a
myth
and
sat
beside
me
in
the
shadow
and
administered
to
me
small
mystic
pellets
that
he
assured
me
in
low
husky
whispers
and
foreign
accent
would
infallibly
cure
my
malady
my
physical
one
at
least
as
for
the
mind
its
forces
he
regretted
to
add
were
beyond
such
influence
for
a
moment
the
wild
suspicion
intruded
on
my
fevered
brain
that
this
leech
was
no
other
than
basil
bainrothe
himself
disguised
for
his
own
dark
purposes
but
the
tall
square
form
that
rose
before
me
to
depart
taller
by
half
a
head
than
the
man
i
suspected
of
this
fresh
deception
and
the
angular
movements
and
large
extremities
of
englehart
dispelled
this
delusion
forever
after
all
might
he
not
be
honest
even
if
a
tool
of
bainrothe
i
took
the
sugared
minature
pills
the
novel
medicine
he
had
left
for
me
faithfully
through
ministry
of
clayton
and
was
benefited
by
them
and
when
he
came
again
as
before
in
the
twilight
i
was
able
to
be
installed
in
the
great
cushioned
chair
he
had
sent
up
for
me
and
to
bear
the
light
of
a
shaded
lamp
in
one
corner
of
the
large
apartment
englehart
approached
me
deferentially
and
without
divesting
himself
of
the
gloves
which
fitted
his
large
hands
so
closely
he
clasped
my
wrist
with
his
finger
and
thumb
and
seemed
to
count
my
pulses
ver
much
bettair
was
his
first
remark
made
in
that
disagreeable
harsh
and
husky
voice
of
his
while
he
bent
so
near
me
that
the
aroma
of
the
tobacco
he
had
been
smoking
caused
me
to
cough
and
turn
aside
still
i
could
not
see
his
face
for
the
immense
bushy
whiskers
he
wore
nor
his
eyes
for
the
glasses
that
covered
them
nor
his
teeth
even
for
the
long
fierce
mustache
that
swept
his
lips
and
when
after
a
brief
visit
he
rose
and
was
gone
again
there
remained
only
in
my
mind
the
image
of
a
huge
and
hairy
horror
a
sort
of
bear
of
the
blue
mountains
from
the
return
of
which
or
whom
i
fervently
hoped
to
be
delivered
send
him
word
i
am
better
clayton
i
entreated
i
can
not
see
him
again
he
is
so
repulsive
and
if
you
have
a
woman
heart
in
your
breast
never
leave
me
alone
with
him
or
with
bainrothe
when
he
calls
for
one
moment
they
inspire
me
equally
with
terror
indescribable
and
i
covered
my
face
to
hide
its
burning
blushes
look
up
miss
monfort
and
listen
to
me
said
clayton
at
last
regarding
me
keenly
with
her
warped
forefinger
uplifted
in
her
usual
admonitory
fashion
but
with
an
expression
on
her
face
of
interest
and
sympathy
such
as
i
had
never
witnessed
there
before
a
new
light
has
broken
just
now
upon
my
understanding
i
ca
tell
how
or
whence
it
came
but
here
it
is
pressing
her
hand
to
her
brow
i
believe
you
have
been
misrepresented
to
me
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
shall
watch
you
closely
and
faithfully
until
we
part
all
the
more
that
i
do
not
believe
you
any
more
crazy
than
i
am
i
half
suspected
this
before
but
i
know
it
now
she
paused
then
continued
i
should
have
to
tell
you
my
life
secret
if
i
were
to
explain
to
you
why
bainrothe
interests
are
so
dear
to
me
so
vital
even
and
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
i
knew
your
guardeen
good
name
depends
on
your
confinement
here
until
you
come
of
age
after
that
it
will
only
be
necessary
for
you
to
sign
a
few
papers
and
all
will
be
straight
again
no
harm
or
insult
is
designed
to
these
i
would
never
have
lent
myself
in
any
way
ill
as
you
think
of
me
and
as
long
as
we
continue
together
i
will
guard
your
good
name
as
i
would
do
that
of
my
own
dear
daughter
that
is
if
i
had
one
you
shall
receive
no
visitor
alone
she
spoke
with
a
feeling
and
dignity
of
which
i
had
scarcely
believed
her
capable
shrewd
and
sensible
as
i
knew
her
to
be
and
far
above
the
woman
she
called
her
mistress
in
a
certain
of
manner
and
delicacy
of
deportment
usually
inseparable
from
i
could
not
then
guess
how
acceptable
to
her
and
the
person
she
was
chiefly
interested
in
were
these
signs
of
my
aversion
for
basil
bainrothe
and
what
sure
means
they
were
of
access
to
the
only
tender
spot
in
the
obdurate
heart
of
rachel
clayton
certain
it
is
that
from
these
expressions
i
derived
the
first
consolation
that
had
come
to
me
in
my
immurement
and
from
that
hour
the
solemn
farce
of
keeper
and
lunatic
ceased
to
be
played
between
us
two
from
such
freedom
of
communication
on
my
jailer
part
i
began
to
hope
for
additional
information
which
never
came
it
was
in
vain
that
i
conjured
her
to
tell
me
where
my
prison
was
situated
whether
at
the
edge
of
the
city
or
far
away
in
the
country
or
to
suffer
me
to
have
a
glimpse
from
a
window
of
my
vicinity
to
all
such
entreaties
she
was
pitiless
and
i
was
left
to
that
vague
and
vain
conjecture
which
so
wears
the
intellect
in
the
absence
of
all
possibility
of
escape
it
became
a
morbid
and
haunting
wish
with
me
to
know
my
exact
locality
that
it
could
be
no
great
distance
from
the
city
of
new
york
if
not
within
its
limits
i
felt
assured
from
the
expedition
with
which
my
transit
from
the
ship
had
been
effected
during
the
first
three
weeks
of
my
confinement
the
deep
silence
that
prevailed
about
me
had
led
me
to
adopt
the
opinion
that
i
was
the
occupant
of
a
de
i
had
once
driven
past
one
on
staten
island
where
a
friend
of
my
father
about
whose
condition
he
came
to
inquire
personally
had
been
immured
for
years
i
did
not
alight
with
him
when
he
left
the
carriage
to
make
these
inquiries
but
i
perfectly
remembered
the
old
gray
stone
building
with
its
ancient
elms
and
the
impression
of
gloom
and
awe
it
had
left
on
my
mind
but
this
idea
was
presently
dispelled
i
was
awakened
one
morning
in
the
fourth
week
of
my
sojourn
in
captivity
by
the
sound
of
chimes
long
familiar
to
my
ear
the
duplicate
of
which
i
had
not
supposed
to
be
in
existence
at
first
i
feared
it
was
some
mirage
of
the
ear
so
to
speak
instead
of
eye
that
reflected
back
that
fairy
melody
which
had
rung
its
accompaniment
to
my
whole
childhood
and
youth
but
when
after
the
lapse
of
seven
days
it
was
repeated
i
became
convinced
that
its
reality
was
unquestionable
and
that
neither
impatience
nor
indignation
had
so
impaired
my
senses
as
to
reproduce
those
sounds
through
the
medium
of
a
fevered
imagination
were
these
delicious
bells
a
recent
addition
to
the
cupola
of
our
grim
asylum
bestowed
by
some
benevolent
hand
that
sought
to
mark
and
lend
enchantment
to
the
holy
even
for
the
sake
of
the
irresponsible
ones
within
its
walls
or
was
i
indeed
but
of
this
there
could
be
no
question
i
dared
not
hazard
such
conjecture
lest
it
drive
me
mad
in
reality
i
must
not
i
groped
in
thick
darkness
and
time
itself
was
only
measured
now
by
those
sweet
chimes
so
like
our
own
and
yet
so
far
away
my
very
clock
one
morning
was
found
to
have
stopped
and
was
not
again
repaired
or
set
in
motion
papers
i
never
saw
had
never
seen
since
i
came
to
dwell
in
shadow
save
that
single
one
so
ostentatiously
spread
before
me
announcing
the
loss
of
the
kosciusko
and
her
passengers
a
refinement
of
cruelty
on
the
part
of
those
who
sent
it
worthy
of
a
japanese
rafts
had
been
launched
and
lost
the
survivors
stated
the
men
who
had
seized
the
to
the
exclusion
of
the
women
and
children
the
sea
had
swallowed
all
the
remainder
a
later
statement
might
refute
the
first
but
even
then
none
could
know
the
truth
with
regard
to
my
identity
for
would
not
basil
bainrothe
control
the
publication
as
he
pleased
and
make
me
dead
if
he
listed
dead
even
after
the
rescue
yet
hope
would
sometimes
whisper
in
her
daring
moods
all
this
shall
pass
away
and
be
as
it
had
not
been
be
of
good
heart
miriam
and
do
not
let
them
kill
you
live
for
mabel
live
for
wentworth
then
with
bowed
head
and
silent
streaming
tears
my
soul
would
climb
in
prayer
to
the
footstool
of
the
most
high
and
the
grace
which
had
never
come
to
me
before
fell
over
me
like
a
mantle
in
this
sad
extremity
chapter
vi
unfaltering
in
her
respectful
demeanor
toward
me
was
clayton
from
the
time
of
the
little
scene
i
have
recently
described
what
new
and
sudden
light
had
broken
in
upon
her
i
never
knew
but
i
supposed
at
the
time
that
the
flash
of
conviction
had
gone
home
to
her
mind
with
regard
to
the
baseness
of
bainrothe
and
the
iniquity
of
his
proceedings
founded
on
the
fear
i
had
expressed
of
his
solitary
presence
and
the
insight
she
had
gained
into
my
character
watching
none
the
less
strictly
she
gradually
relaxed
that
personal
surveillance
that
is
ever
so
intolerable
to
the
proud
and
and
those
suggestions
that
however
well
intended
had
been
so
irritating
to
me
from
such
a
source
she
no
longer
urged
me
to
read
or
sew
or
eat
or
take
exercise
but
retiring
into
her
own
work
whence
she
could
observe
me
at
her
pleasure
for
her
door
was
always
set
wide
open
and
her
face
turned
in
my
direction
she
employed
or
feigned
to
employ
herself
in
her
inexhaustible
or
either
one
the
last
resource
of
idiocy
as
it
seemed
to
me
left
thus
to
myself
in
some
degree
i
unclosed
the
leaves
of
the
bookcase
and
surveyed
its
grim
array
of
classics
all
new
and
unmarked
by
any
name
or
sign
of
having
been
read
and
from
them
i
selected
a
few
worthies
through
whose
pages
i
delved
drearily
and
industriously
and
most
unprofitably
it
must
be
confessed
the
only
living
sensations
i
received
from
the
contents
of
that
bookcase
were
i
am
ashamed
to
acknowledge
from
a
few
odd
volumes
of
memoirs
and
collections
of
travels
that
i
had
happened
to
find
stowed
away
behind
the
others
the
rest
seemed
sermons
from
the
stars
captain
cook
voyages
and
levaillant
descriptions
did
stir
me
very
slightly
with
their
strong
reality
and
make
me
for
a
few
hours
forget
myself
and
my
captivity
but
all
the
rest
prated
at
me
like
parrots
from
stately
pragmatical
johnson
down
to
sentimental
maudlin
sterne
i
found
them
intolerable
in
the
mood
in
which
i
was
nothing
so
exhausting
as
the
abstract
and
closed
the
book
desperately
to
resume
my
diary
neglected
since
the
awful
events
of
beauseincourt
but
always
to
me
a
resource
in
time
of
trouble
and
of
solitude
of
pens
ink
paper
there
was
no
lack
and
i
wrote
one
day
what
i
destroyed
the
next
yet
this
very
jotting
down
impressed
upon
my
brain
the
few
incidents
of
my
recorded
here
that
might
otherwise
have
faded
from
my
memory
in
the
twilight
of
monotony
i
had
no
need
to
sew
fair
linen
and
a
sufficiency
of
other
plain
including
summer
gowns
i
found
laid
carefully
in
my
drawers
and
the
creole
negress
brought
in
my
clothes
well
ironed
and
carefully
mended
to
be
laid
away
by
the
orderly
hands
of
clayton
once
during
the
temporary
illness
of
this
dragon
whose
bed
or
lair
was
placed
absolutely
across
the
door
of
egress
from
her
closet
so
as
to
block
the
way
or
make
it
difficult
of
access
the
creole
in
an
unavoidable
contingency
like
this
came
with
a
pile
of
clothing
in
her
arms
to
lay
the
pieces
herself
in
the
bureau
by
direction
of
my
jailer
and
thus
revealed
herself
by
the
merest
accident
i
had
found
in
the
lining
of
my
purse
two
pieces
of
gold
the
rest
of
my
money
had
been
spirited
away
with
the
belt
that
contained
it
or
the
leather
had
been
destroyed
by
the
action
of
the
saltwater
and
one
of
these
i
hastened
to
bestow
on
the
attendant
signifying
silence
by
a
gesture
as
i
did
so
i
knew
this
wretch
to
be
wholly
selfish
and
mercenary
from
my
experience
of
her
on
the
raft
for
that
she
was
the
same
negress
i
had
long
ceased
to
doubt
and
i
determined
while
i
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
to
enter
a
wedge
of
confidence
between
us
in
the
only
possible
way
sabra
i
whispered
what
became
of
the
young
girl
ada
lee
and
the
deformed
child

surely
can
do
no
harm
to
tell
me

all
eying
the
gold
held
closely
in
her
palm
i
caught
eagerly
at
the
idea
of
the
child
presence
though
the
rest
was
greek
to
my
comprehension
until
long
afterward
when
in
untangling
a
chain
of
iniquity
difficult
to
match
it
formed
one
important
but
additional
link
poor
little
ernie
i
would
give
so
much
to
see
him
i
said
ask
englehart
to
let
him
come
to
see
me
sabra
and
some
day
i
will
reward
you
all
this
in
the
faintest
whisper
but
raymond
where
is
she
does
she
never
come

i
desire
earnestly
to
speak
with
her
you
let
her
know
this
try
sabra
for
humanity
sake
at
this
juncture
the
head
of
clayton
was
thrust
forth
from
its
shell
and
appeared
peering
at
the
you
have
been
there
long
enough
to
make
these
clothes
instead
of
putting
them
away
old
woman
was
the
sharp
rebuke
that
startled
the
pretended
dinah
to
a
condition
of
bustling
agitation
and
induced
her
to
shut
up
one
of
her
own
shrivelled
hands
in
closing
the
drawer
with
a
force
that
made
her
cry
aloud
and
when
released
wring
it
with
agony
that
drew
some
words
in
the
vernacular
what
makes
you
suppose
miss
monfort
wants
to
hear
your
chattering
old
magpie
that
you
are
continued
clayton
throwing
off
her
mask
now
walk
very
straight
or
the
police
shall
have
you
next
time
you
steal
from
a
companion
remember
who
rescued
you
on
the
latona
and
on
what
conditions
and
take
care
how
you
conduct
yourself
in
the
future
do
you
understand
me
after
this
tirade
which
sorely
exhausted
her
clayton
relapsed
into
silence
and
now
it
was
my
time
to
speak
and
even
scold
i
said
now
that
the
spanish
farce
is
thrown
aside
it
is
hard
indeed
that
i
can
not
even
be
allowed
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
a
laundress
in
my
solitary
condition
hard
that
i
should
be
pressed
to
the
wall
in
this
fiendish
fashion
this
woman
was
telling
me
of
the
presence
of
a
little
child
in
the
house
and
i
have
desired
permission
to
see
it
by
way
of
diversion
and
occupation
i
have
asked
her
to
apply
to
dr
englehart
the
child
shall
come
to
you
miss
monfort
whenever
you
wish
said
clayton
with
eagerness
this
woman
is
not
the
proper
person
to
apply
to
however
and
it
is
natural
you
should
feel
concerned
about
it
now
that
you
are
able
to
think
and
feel
again
you
know
of
course
it
is
the
boy
of
the
wreck
yes
very
natural
its
mother
died
in
my
arms
if
i
am
not
mistaken
in
the
identity
of
the
child
and
fortunately
i
paused
here
arrested
by
some
strange
instinct
of
prudence
and
decided
not
to
show
further
interest
in
his
fate
he
might
be
inquired
for
and
traced
even
i
reflected
and
thus
my
own
existence
be
brought
to
light
selfishly
as
well
as
charitably
would
i
cherish
him
little
children
had
ever
been
a
passion
with
me
but
this
poor
repulsive
thing
was
the
of
desolation
that
very
evening
i
heard
the
husky
and
guttural
voice
of
englehart
in
the
adjoining
chamber
or
rather
in
the
closet
of
clayton
a
mere
anteroom
originally
as
it
seemed
to
the
large
apartment
i
occupied
it
was
very
natural
that
in
her
ill
condition
my
dragon
should
seek
medical
aid
and
i
paid
no
further
attention
to
the
propinquity
of
this
unpleasant
visitor
than
i
could
help
sitting
quietly
by
my
shaded
lamp
absorbed
in
the
psalter
in
which
i
found
nightly
refuge
he
came
in
at
last
after
tapping
very
lightly
on
the
unsolicited
and
unexpected
to
my
presence
the
same
inscrutable
hirsute
horror
i
had
seen
before
with
his
trudging
scraping
walk
his
square
and
stalwart
frame
his
gloved
extremities
his
light
hat
and
cane
in
hand
a
being
as
i
felt
to
chill
very
marrow
is
it
true
vat
i
hear
he
asked
pausing
at
some
distance
dat
you
vant
to
have
dat
leetle
hompback
chilt
for
a
companion
miss
monfort
it
is
true
dr
englehart
and
vat
can
your
motif
be
heh
i
must
study
dat
for
a
leetle
before
i
can
decide
de
question
or
even
trost
him
as
a
human
being
in
your
hands
lunatics
are
rarely
governed
by
motives
at
all
i
replied
only
impulses
i
want
human
companionship
however
that
is
all
i
sicken
in
this
solitude
i
am
dying
of
mental
inanition
it
is
true
you
look
delicate
indeed
i
am
pained
to
see
the
accent
was
forgotten
here
for
a
moment
and
an
expression
of
real
sympathy
was
perceivable
in
his
low
husky
voice
command
me
in
any
way
dat
accords
wid
my
duty
he
continued
yes
de
boy
shall
come
to
interest
to
amuse
you
is
perhaps
to
cure
thank
you
i
shall
await
his
advent
anxiously
be
careful
not
to
disappoint
me
oh
not
for
vorlds
you
are
very
kind
i
believe
though
that
is
all
we
have
to
say
to
one
another
dr
englehart
you
are
bettair
then
he
said
advancing
steadily
toward
me
in
spite
of
this
dismissal
you
need
no
more
leetle
pill
are
you
quite
sure
of
dat
not
now
at
least
dr
englehart
permit
me
then
to
feel
your
pulse
vonce
more
i
shall
determine
den
more
perfectly
dis
vexing
subject
of
your
sanity
thank
you
i
decline
your
opinion
on
a
matter
so
little
open
to
difference
be
good
enough
to
retire
englehart
let
me
at
least
breathe
freely
in
the
solitude
to
which
i
am
consigned
i
mean
no
offence
yonge
lady
he
said
meekly
falling
back
to
the
on
which
was
burning
my
shaded
astral
lamp
for
i
had
left
it
as
he
approached
instinctively
to
seek
the
protection
of
an
interposing
chair
on
the
back
of
which
i
stood
leaning
as
i
spoke
he
too
remained
standing
with
one
hand
pressed
firmly
backward
on
the
top
of
the
table
in
front
of
which
he
poised
himself
gesticulating
earnestly
yet
respectfully
his
position
was
an
error
of
mistaken
confidence
in
his
own
such
as
we
see
occur
every
day
among
those
even
long
habituated
to
disguise
as
he
stood
i
distinctly
saw
a
line
of
light
traced
between
his
cheek
and
one
of
his
bushy
that
line
of
light
let
in
a
flood
of
evidence
the
man
was
an
impostor
a
tool
as
criminal
as
his
employer
not
the
footprint
on
the
sand
was
more
suggestive
to
robinson
crusoe
than
that
luminous
streak
to
me
nor
the
cause
of
wilder
conjecture
yet
i
betrayed
nothing
of
my
amazement
i
am
convinced
for
after
standing
silently
for
a
time
and
almost
in
a
suppliant
attitude
before
me
englehart
departed
and
for
many
days
i
saw
him
not
again
an
object
that
looked
not
unlike
a
small
solemn
owl
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
regarding
me
silently
when
i
awoke
very
early
on
the
following
morning
at
a
glance
i
recognized
poor
little
ernie
and
singularly
enough
he
knew
and
remembered
me
at
once
ernie
good
boy
now
he
said
as
he
came
toward
me
with
his
tiny
claw
extended
lady
got
cake
in
pocket
give
ernie
some
not
only
did
he
recall
me
it
was
plain
but
the
incident
that
saved
his
life
and
the
rebukes
he
had
received
on
the
raft
for
his
refusal
to
partake
of
briny
biscuit
which
no
persuasion
it
may
be
remembered
had
availed
to
make
him
taste
even
when
devoured
by
the
pangs
of
hunger
i
tried
in
vain
however
to
recall
him
to
some
remembrance
of
his
poor
mother
on
that
point
he
was
invulnerable
the
abstract
had
no
charm
for
him
or
meaning
he
dealt
only
in
realities
and
presences
a
new
element
was
infused
into
my
solitude
from
this
time
in
this
child
i
lived
breathed
and
had
my
being
until
later
events
startled
my
individuality
once
more
into
its
old
currents
of
existence
not
that
i
merged
myself
entirely
in
ernie
sickly
wayward
fitful
ugly
little
mite
that
he
was
undeniably
nay
rather
did
i
draw
him
forcibly
into
my
own
sphere
of
being
and
find
nutrition
in
this
novel
element
so
grudgingly
had
nature
fulfilled
her
obligations
in
the
case
of
this
poor
stunted
infant
that
at
two
and
a
half
years
of
age
he
had
not
the
usual
complement
of
teeth
due
a
child
of
eighteen
months
and
was
suffering
sorely
from
the
pointing
up
of
tardy
through
ulcerated
gums
to
attend
to
and
heal
his
bodily
ailments
occupied
me
entirely
at
first
and
finally
finding
him
ill
cared
for
i
made
him
a
little
pallet
on
my
sofa
and
kept
him
with
me
by
night
and
day
surely
such
devotion
as
he
manifested
in
return
for
my
scant
kindness
to
him
few
mothers
have
received
from
their
offspring
to
sit
silently
at
my
feet
while
i
talked
to
him
or
do
my
bidding
seemed
his
chief
pleasures
as
they
might
not
could
not
have
been
had
he
been
strong
and
active
and
more
soundly
constituted
as
it
was
no
more
loyal
creature
existed
nor
did
the
creator
ever
enshrine
deeper
affections
or
quicker
perceptions
in
any
childish
frame
weird
and
wise
and
witty
as
Ã¦sop
was
this
child
like
him
deformed
and
to
draw
out
his
quaint
remarks
read
him
fresh
from
his
maker
hand
this
warped
and
tiny
imperfect
volume
of
humanity
was
to
me
an
puzzle
and
delight
severity
he
had
been
used
to
of
late
i
saw
plainly
he
shrank
with
winking
eyes
from
an
uplifted
hand
even
if
the
gesture
were
one
of
mere
amazement
or
affection
and
sat
patiently
like
a
little
dog
when
he
saw
food
placed
before
me
until
invited
to
partake
thereof
his
manner
was
wistful
and
deprecating
even
to
pathos
and
i
longed
for
one
burst
of
passion
one
evidence
of
to
prove
to
myself
that
i
like
others
he
had
been
recently
thrown
with
was
not
the
meanest
of
all
created
creatures
a
baby
despot
oh
better
than
this
the
cap
and
bells
and
infant
tyranny
forever
and
the
wildest
freaks
of
baby
folly
he
suffered
silently
as
i
have
seen
no
other
child
do
uncomplainingly
even
and
at
such
times
would
sink
into
moods
of
the
blackest
gloom
like
those
of
an
old
gouty
subject
hypochondria
baby
as
he
was
seemed
already
to
have
fixed
his
fangs
upon
him
he
had
days
of
profound
melancholy
when
nothing
provoked
a
smile
and
others
of
bitter
silent
fretting
inconceivably
distressing
again
there
were
periods
of
the
wildest
joy
only
restrained
by
that
reticence
which
had
become
habitual
from
positive
boisterousness
all
this
i
could
have
compelled
into
subservience
of
course
by
substituting
fear
for
affection
it
is
not
a
difficult
matter
for
the
strong
and
cunning
to
cow
and
crush
the
spirit
of
a
little
child
no
great
achievement
after
all
nor
proof
of
power
though
many
boast
of
it
as
such
strength
and
hardness
of
heart
are
all
one
requires
for
this
external
victory
but
human
souls
are
not
to
be
so
governed
god
be
praised
for
this
and
love
and
respect
are
not
to
be
compelled
it
is
the
error
of
all
errors
to
suppose
that
because
a
child
has
a
sickly
frame
or
imperfect
animal
organization
it
is
just
or
profitable
to
give
it
over
to
its
own
devices
and
consign
it
to
indolence
and
ignorance
alas
the
vacancy
that
begets
fretfulness
and
crude
capricious
desires
the
confusion
of
images
that
arises
from
partial
understanding
are
far
more
wearing
to
the
nerves
of
an
intelligent
infant
than
the
small
labor
the
brain
undertakes
if
any
indeed
be
needed
in
mastering
ideas
properly
presented
and
suitable
to
the
condition
of
the
sufferer
one
might
as
well
forbid
the
hand
to
grasp
the
eye
to
see
nay
more
it
will
not
do
to
confound
the
child
of
genius
with
the
fool
or
to
suppose
that
the
one
needs
not
a
mental
aliment
of
which
the
other
is
incapable
feed
well
the
hungry
mind
lest
it
perish
of
inanition
it
is
a
sponge
in
infancy
that
imbibes
ideas
without
an
effort
it
is
a
through
which
fancy
and
poetry
conduct
away
foul
vapors
it
is
an
alembic
retaining
only
the
pure
and
valuable
of
all
that
is
poured
into
it
to
be
stored
for
future
use
it
is
a
that
conducts
away
from
the
body
all
superfluous
electricity
it
does
not
harm
a
sensible
child
to
put
it
to
study
early
but
it
destroys
a
dull
one
let
your
poor
soil
lie
fallow
but
harvest
your
rich
mould
and
you
shall
be
repaid
without
harm
to
its
fertility
ideas
were
balm
to
ernie
even
as
regarded
his
physical
suffering
his
enthusiasm
rose
above
it
and
carried
him
to
other
spheres
some
illustrated
volumes
of
wilson
ornithology
which
i
found
in
the
bookcase
proved
to
be
oil
on
troubled
waters
in
ernie
case
and
before
long
he
knew
without
an
effort
the
name
of
every
bird
in
the
two
folios
of
prints
and
would
come
of
his
own
accord
to
repeat
and
point
them
out
to
me
i
found
to
my
amazement
that
when
a
cage
of
canaries
was
brought
in
and
hung
in
the
at
my
request
for
his
amusement
he
discriminated
and
gravely
averred
that
no
birds
like
those
were
to
be
found
in
his
big
book
though
yellow
hammers
and
orioles
were
there
in
their
native
colors
that
might
have
deceived
a
less
observant
eye
into
a
delusion
as
to
their
identity
with
our
pretty
importation
verses
remarkable
for
rhyme
and
rhythm
both
when
repeated
to
him
a
few
times
with
scanning
emphasis
took
root
in
that
fertile
brain
which
piled
his
compact
forehead
so
powerfully
above
his
piercing
eyes
and
fell
from
his
infant
lips
in
silvery
melody
as
effortless
and
spontaneous
as
the
trickling
of
water
or
the
singing
of
birds
in
the
trees
day
by
day
i
saw
the
little
wistful
face
relaxing
from
the
expression
so
to
speak
of
sour
and
serious
suffering
and
assuming
something
akin
to
baby
joyousness
and
the
small
warped
figure
so
low
that
it
walked
under
my
dropped
and
level
hand
acquiring
security
of
step
and
erectness
of
bearing
i
knew
little
of
the
treatment
required
for
spinal
disease
but
taught
me
that
in
order
to
effect
a
cure
the
vertebral
column
must
be
relieved
as
much
as
possible
from
pressure
and
allowed
to
rest
so
i
persuaded
him
to
lie
down
a
great
part
of
the
time
and
contrived
for
him
a
little
sustaining
brace
to
relieve
him
when
he
walked
i
fed
him
carefully
i
bathed
him
tenderly
and
robbed
his
weary
aching
limbs
to
rest
so
that
before
many
weeks
the
change
was
surprising
and
the
success
of
my
treatment
evident
to
all
who
saw
him
the
comprehensive
all
being
myself
and
two
attendants
englehart
had
been
suggested
in
the
beginning
by
clayton
as
his
medical
attendant
but
rejected
by
me
with
a
shudder
that
seemed
conclusive
yet
one
evening
unsummoned
by
me
and
as
far
as
i
knew
by
any
other
he
walked
calmly
into
my
apartment
ostensibly
to
see
the
little
invalid
his
charge
as
well
as
mine
for
a
moment
the
extravagant
idea
possessed
me
that
in
spite
of
appearances
i
had
done
this
man
injustice
and
that
he
came
in
reality
for
humane
purposes
alone
wore
his
disguise
for
these
this
delusion
was
soon
dissipated
as
with
audacity
no
doubt
characteristic
though
not
before
evidenced
to
me
he
seated
himself
complacently
and
uninvited
and
disposing
of
his
hat
and
stick
settled
himself
down
for
a
an
affair
which
if
medical
usually
partakes
of
the
confidential
your
little
miss
monfort
he
said
huskily
seems
to
be
a
serious
sufferer
and
for
a
moment
dropping
his
accent
while
he
rubbed
his
gloved
hands
together
as
with
an
come
tell
me
now
what
you
are
doing
for
his
benefit
again
artistically
assuming
a
foreign
accentuation
in
a
few
words
i
described
my
course
of
treatment
and
its
success
all
very
well
he
responded
hoarsely
as
far
as
it
goes
but
i
am
convinced
that
much
severer
treatment
will
he
necessaire
i
think
not
i
replied
curtly
and
certainly
nothing
of
the
kind
will
be
permitted
by
me
while
i
have
charge
of
this
poor
infant
a
few
leetle
pills
then
for
both
mother
and
child
he
suggested
humbly
you
are
mistaken
if
you
imagine
any
relationship
to
exist
between
ernie
and
myself
i
answered
calmly
never
dreaming
at
the
moment
of
covert
or
intended
insult
i
might
as
well
inform
you
at
once
that
i
am
miss
not
monfort
you
should
he
guarded
how
you
make
mistakes
of
that
nature
and
my
eye
flashed
fire
i
felt
for
i
now
heard
him
chuckling
low
in
the
shadow
in
which
he
so
carefully
concealed
himself
i
shall
remembair
vat
you
say
he
observed
and
try
to
do
bettair
next
visit
but
all
dis
time
i
delay
in
de
execution
of
my
mission
here
see
i
have
brought
you
von
lettair
now
vat
will
you
do
to
reward
me
holding
it
high
above
my
head
in
a
manner
meant
no
doubt
to
be
playful
and
to
suggest
a
game
of
snatch
perhaps
such
as
his
peers
might
have
afforded
him
he
displayed
his
treasure
to
my
longing
eyes
but
i
sat
with
folded
arms
if
the
letter
brings
me
good
news
i
shall
thank
you
warmly
englehart
if
not
i
shall
try
to
believe
you
unconscious
of
its
contents
tanks
from
your
lips
would
indeed
seem
priceless
he
remarked
courteously
as
with
many
bows
and
shrugs
he
laid
it
on
the
table
before
me
bringing
his
shaggy
head
by
such
means
much
closer
to
my
hand
than
i
cared
to
know
it
should
be
under
any
circumstances
with
a
gesture
of
inexpressible
disgust
regretted
the
next
moment
as
i
reflected
that
to
bring
me
this
letter
he
might
be
overstepping
common
rules
i
raised
the
envelope
to
the
light
and
recognized
to
my
intense
disappointment
the
characters
of
bainrothe
small
rigid
neat
constrained
my
heart
which
a
moment
before
had
beat
audibly
to
my
own
ear
sank
like
a
stone
in
my
breast
and
i
sat
for
a
time
holding
the
letter
mutely
uncertain
how
to
proceed
should
i
return
it
unread
and
thus
hurl
the
gauntlet
in
the
traitor
face
or
be
governed
by
expedience
word
ever
so
despised
by
me
of
old
and
trace
the
venom
of
the
viper
by
his
trail
back
to
his
native
den
after
a
brief
conflict
of
feeling
i
determined
on
the
wiser
course
that
of
as
a
measure
of
profound
policy
i
broke
the
seal
the
effigy
which
he
called
in
heraldry
the
quarry
and
claimed
as
his
rightful
crest
very
significantly
indeed
did
it
strike
me
now
though
i
had
jested
on
the
subject
so
merrily
of
old
with
evelyn
and
george
gaston
the
letter
was
of
very
recent
date
and
ran
as
follows
i
have
the
original
still
and
this
is
an
exact
copy
on
september
or
as
soon
thereafter
as
feasible
i
shall
call
to
see
you
miriam
in
your
retirement
which
i
am
glad
to
hear
has
so
far
been
beneficial
should
i
find
you
in
a
condition
to
conditions
i
shall
lay
before
you
a
very
advantageous
offer
of
marriage
i
had
received
for
you
before
your
shipwreck
should
you
accept
this
offer
and
attach
your
signature
to
a
few
papers
that
i
shall
bring
with
me
papers
important
to
the
respectability
of
your
whole
family
as
well
as
my
own
i
shall
at
once
resign
to
you
your
father
house
and
the
guardianship
of
mabel
the
chimera
that
alarmed
you
to
frenzy
can
have
no
further
existence
either
in
fact
or
fancy
i
am
about
to
contract
an
advantageous
marriage
with
a
foreign
lady
of
rank
wealth
and
beauty
to
whom
i
hope
soon
to
introduce
you
i
need
not
mention
her
name
if
you
are
wise
be
patient
and
cheerful
cultivate
your
talents
and
take
care
of
your
good
looks
no
woman
can
afford
to
dispense
with
these
however
gifted
and
you
will
soon
find
yourself
as
free
as
that
libertine
the
air
for
which
last
two
words
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
malicious
enough
to
substitute
the
name
you
will
not
find
appended
of
your
true
friend
and
guardian
had
wentworth
spoken
then
did
he
know
of
my
immurement
was
it
his
beloved
presence
his
dear
hand
that
were
to
be
made
the
prize
of
my
silence
and
submission
was
the
bitter
pill
of
humiliation
i
was
now
swallowing
to
be
gilded
thus
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
he
was
not
the
man
with
whom
to
make
such
conditions
the
man
i
loved
nay
worshiped
almost
he
was
of
the
old
heroic
mould
that
would
have
preferred
any
certainty
to
suspense
and
death
itself
to
an
degradation
he
deemed
me
dead
and
the
obstacle
that
had
risen
between
us
needed
no
explanation
now
the
waves
had
swallowed
all
necessities
like
this
but
had
he
known
me
the
inmate
of
a
no
bolts
or
bars
would
have
withheld
him
from
my
presence
his
own
eyes
could
alone
have
convinced
him
of
such
ruin
as
was
alleged
against
me
by
these
friends
from
this
survey
of
my
utter
helplessness
i
turned
suddenly
to
confront
the
deep
dark
salient
eyes
of
the
disciple
of
hahnemann
real
or
pretended
fixed
upon
me
with
a
glance
that
even
his
blue
spectacles
could
not
deprive
of
its
subtle
intensity
where
had
i
seen
before
orbs
of
the
same
peculiarity
of
expression
or
caught
the
outline
of
the
profile
which
suddenly
riveted
my
gaze
as
the
light
partially
revealed
it
then
subsided
into
shadow
again
i
pondered
this
question
for
a
moment
while
englehart
silent
expectant
perhaps
stood
with
his
hand
tightly
grasping
the
back
of
a
chair
on
the
seat
of
which
he
reposed
one
knee
in
a
position
such
as
defiant
often
assume
before
a
pedagogue
as
i
have
said
his
head
and
body
were
again
in
shadow
as
was
indeed
most
of
the
chamber
for
the
rays
which
struggled
through
the
thick
ground
glass
of
my
astral
lamp
were
as
mild
as
moonbeams
and
as
unsatisfactory
but
the
light
fell
strong
and
red
beneath
the
shade
and
the
full
glare
of
the
astral
lamp
seemed
centred
on
that
pudgy
hand
in
its
inevitable
glove
that
had
fixed
so
firm
a
gripe
on
the
back
of
the
mahogany
chair
as
to
strain
open
one
of
the
fingers
of
the
tight
tawny
worn
by
englehart
this
had
parted
slightly
just
above
the
knuckle
of
the
and
revealed
the
cotton
stuffing
within
nay
more
the
ruby
ring
with
its
peculiar
device
was
thus
exposed
which
graced
the
slender
finger
of
the
charlatan
i
do
not
apply
this
term
as
concerned
the
profession
he
affected
at
all
but
merely
as
shall
be
seen
later
as
one
appropriate
to
himself
individually
there
must
be
beings
of
all
kinds
to
constitute
a
world
philosophers
tell
us
and
he
no
doubt
so
long
in
ignorance
of
it
had
stumbled
suddenly
on
his
proper
vocation
at
last
the
he
was
playing
so
far
successfully
had
doubtless
been
the
occasion
of
an
exquisite
delight
to
him
unknown
to
simpler
mortals
who
masquerade
not
without
dread
misgivings
of
detection
i
for
one
when
affecting
any
costume
not
essentially
belonging
to
me
or
covering
my
face
even
with
a
for
holiday
diversion
have
had
a
feeling
of
unusual
transparency
and
obviousness
so
to
speak
which
precluded
on
my
part
every
thing
like
a
successful
maintenance
of
the
part
i
was
attempting
to
play
it
was
as
if
some
mocking
voice
was
saying
this
is
miriam
monfort
the
true
miriam
the
person
you
have
known
before
as
such
was
only
making
believe
but
the
is
before
you
a
volume
of
folly
that
all
who
run
may
read
behold
her
she
was
never
half
so
evident
before
but
to
digress
thus
in
the
very
moment
of
detection
of
recognition
seems
irrelevant
the
flash
of
conviction
was
as
instantaneous
in
its
action
in
my
mind
as
that
of
the
lightning
when
it
strikes
its
object
i
stood
confounded
yet
enlightened
all
ablaze
but
the
subject
of
this
discovery
did
not
seem
in
the
least
to
apprehend
it
or
to
believe
it
possible
in
his
mad
effrontery
of
that
by
his
own
track
he
could
be
betrayed
vat
ansair
shall
i
bear
to
bainrothe
from
his
vard
asked
the
mercury
of
my
jove
clasping
his
costumed
hands
together
then
dropping
them
meekly
before
him
i

good
enough
to
write
at
once
your
reply
to
de
vise
conditions
of
your
excellent
guardian
you
know
them
then
i
said
quickly
glancing
at
him
with
a
derisive
scorn
that
did
not
escape
his
observation
i
have
dat
honnair
was
the
hypocritical
reply
accompanied
by
a
profound
bow
disgrace
rather
i
substituted
but
you
have
your
own
of
view
of
course
the
shield
that
to
you
is
white
to
me
is
black
as
erebus
you
remember
the
knights
of
fable
always
the
same
always
indomitable
i
heard
him
murmur
so
low
that
it
was
marvelous
how
the
words
reached
my
ear
tense
as
was
every
sense
with
disdainful
excitement
yet
he
simply
said
aloud
after
his
impulsive
excuse
me
i
understand
not
your
allusions
i
pretend
not
to
de
classics
my
leetle
pills
and
he
hesitated
or
affected
to
do
so
enough
i
waive
all
apologies
they
only
prolong
an
interview
singularly
distasteful
to
me
for
many
reasons
you
are
behind
the
curtain
i
can
not
doubt
and
understand
not
only
the
contents
of
that
absurd
letter
but
its
unprincipled
references
to
basil
bainrothe
i
will
never
address
one
line
but
you
may
say
to
him
that
i
scorn
him
and
his
conditions
yet
helpless
as
i
am
and
in
his
hands
tell
him
to
bring
his
emancipation
papers
and
i
will
sign
them
though
they
cost
me
all
i
possess
of
property
my
sister
i
will
not
surrender
any
longer
to
his
care
nor
my
right
in
her
which
with
or
without
his
consent
is
perfect
when
i
reach
my
majority
as
to
the
suitor
to
whom
he
alluded
he
had
better
be
allowed
to
speak
for
himself
when
this
transaction
is
over
i
shall
then
decide
very
calmly
on
his
merits
tarnished
as
these
might
seem
from
such
recommendation
he
is
one
who
has
loved
you
long
lady
said
the
man
sadly
speaking
ever
in
that
made
and
husky
voice
wonderful
actor
that
he
was
by
nature
which
he
sustained
so
well
that
had
i
not
unmistakably
identified
him
it
might
have
imposed
on
my
ear
as
real
hear
what
has
been
written
on
this
subject
when
others
have
forsaken
you
and
left
you
to
your
fate
he
has
continued
faithful
to
your
memory
the
revelation
of
your
immurement
was
made
simultaneously
to
two
men
who
called
themselves
your
lovers
and
its
sad
necessity
explained
by
your
guardian
one
of
these
lovers
repudiated
your
claims
upon
him
and
turned
coldly
from
the
idea
of
uniting
his
fate
to
that
of
one
who
had
even
for
an
hour
been
a
suspected
lunatic
the
other
declared
himself
willing
to
take
her
as
she
was
to
his
arms
even
though
her
own
were
loaded
with
the
chains
of
a
penniless
and
abandoned
by
all
the
world
and
with
a
clouded
name
he
woos
her
as
his
wife
the
woman
he
adores
and
as
he
read
or
seemed
to
read
these
words
with
scarce
an
accent
to
mar
their
impetuous
flow
englehart
drew
in
his
breath
with
the
hissing
sound
of
passion
and
folded
his
arms
tightly
across
his
padded
breast
as
if
they
enfolded
the
bride
he
was
suing
for
in
name
and
who
let
me
ask
is
this
paladin
of
chivalry
i
inquired
derisively
give
me
his
name
that
i
may
consider
the
subject
well
and
thoroughly
before
we
meet
at
last
excuse
me
if
i
refuse
to
give
the
name
of
eider
of
dese
gentlemen
at
dis
onhappy
season
he
rejoined
wen
de
brain
is
all
right
again
tapping
his
own
forehead
your
guardian
will
conduct
the
faithful
knight
to
kneel
at
de
feet
of
her
he
loves
so
well
and
the
other
where
is
he
fell
involuntarily
from
my
lips
my
heaving
heart
an
inquiry
that
i
regretted
as
soon
as
it
was
uttered
for
affecting
sorrowful
mystery
the
man
inclined
himself
toward
me
and
whispered
in
my
ear
confidentially
plighted
to
another
and
gone
where
no
eyes
of
yours
shall
rest
on
him
again
pander
liar
spy
burst
from
my
passionate
lips
as
in
all
the
fury
of
desperation
i
turned
from
the
creature
who
had
so
wantonly
wounded
my
and
waved
to
him
to
begone
another
name
quivered
on
my
lips
but
i
checked
it
on
their
threshold
after
that
first
burst
of
indignation
instantly
subdued
i
was
not
brave
enough
nor
strong
enough
to
hazard
a
shaft
like
that
which
might
have
been
returned
to
me
so
deathfully
i
would
let
the
barrier
stand
which
he
had
erected
between
us
and
which
to
demolish
would
be
to
lay
myself
open
perhaps
to
insult
of
the
darkest
description
let
the
ostrich
with
his
head
in
the
sand
still
imagine
himself
unseen
the
masquerader
still
conceive
himself
secure
beneath
his
paper
travesty
the
serpent
still
coil
apparently
unrecognized
beside
the
bare
gray
stone
that
reveals
him
to
the
eye
i
was
too
cowardly
too
feeble
to
cope
with
strategy
and
duplicity
like
this
so
the
man
went
his
way
with
his
silly
secret
undiscovered
as
he
deemed
and
that
it
might
remain
so
to
the
end
as
far
as
he
could
know
i
devoutly
prayed
for
i
knew
of
old
the
unscrupulous
lengths
to
which
when
nerved
by
hate
or
disappointment
or
passions
of
any
kind
he
could
go
without
a
particle
of
mercy
for
his
victims
or
remorse
for
his
when
englehart
was
gone
for
so
i
still
choose
to
call
him
for
some
reasons
although
i
give
my
reader
credit
for
still
more
astuteness
than
i
possessed
myself
and
believe
that
he
has
long
ago
recognized
through
this
cloud
of
mystery
and
travesty
thrown
about
him
an
old
acquaintance
the
child
ernie
rose
from
the
bed
on
which
he
had
lain
tremulous
and
observant
with
his
small
hands
clinched
his
eyes
on
fire
ernie
kill
bad
man
he
exclaimed
ferociously
for
trouble

it
away
and

no

i
will
keep
it

as
i
laid
it
carefully
aside

stand
as
a
sign
and
testimony
of
treachery

the
end

to

little

but
first
say
your
prayers
so
that
the
good
angels
may
sit
by
you

you
hear
clayton
groaning
poor
clayton
i
most
go
and
comfort
her
and
soothe
her
pains
as
dinah
can
not
do
and
now
that
the
bad
doctor
is
gone
home
and
we
are
all
locked
up
again
securely
we
shall
rest
peacefully

so
chapter
vii
from
being
the
most
silent
of
children
a
perfect
in
every
way
ernie
had
become
fearfully
loquacious
under
my
care
and
was
now
as
talkative
as
he
had
ever
been
observant
the
action
that
most
children
develop
through
exercise
of
limb
had
been
reserved
for
his
untiring
tongue
he
had
literally
learned
to
talk
from
hearing
me
read
aloud
which
i
did
daily
much
to
clayton
delight
and
edification
for
the
benefit
of
my
own
lungs
which
suffered
from
such
confirmed
silence
as
i
had
at
first
indulged
in
his
exquisite
ear
his
prodigious
memory
aided
him
in
the
acquirement
of
words
and
even
long
and
difficult
sentences
of
which
he
delivered
himself
oracularly
when
engaged
with
his
blocks
and
dominoes
he
told
himself
wonderful
stories
in
which
the
buful
faiwry
and
hollible
giant
of
the
figured
largely
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
acknowledge
that
i
would
hold
my
breath
and
strain
my
ear
at
times
to
listen
to
these
murmured
stories
as
i
have
never
done
to
receive
the
finest
ebullitions
of
eloquence
or
the
veriest
marvels
of
the
there
was
something
so
sweet
so
wondrous
to
me
in
this
little
fountain
content
with
its
own
music
having
no
thought
of
auditors
or
effect
no
care
for
appreciation
totally
and
that
i
was
never
weary
of
giving
it
my
ear
and
interest
had
the
child
known
of
or
perceived
this
the
effect
would
have
been
destroyed
and
a
fatal
have
been
instituted
instead
of
this
infantile
the
very
existence
of
which
mood
indicated
genius
what
poor
ernie
father
might
nave
been
i
could
only
surmise
from
his
own
qualities
which
after
all
may
have
flowed
from
a
source
but
that
his
mother
had
been
gentle
simple
and
inefficient
i
knew
full
well
from
my
slight
acquaintance
with
her
and
observation
of
her
organization
ernie
on
the
contrary
grappled
with
obstacles
uncomplainingly
and
was
only
outspoken
in
his
moments
of
gratification
his
was
the
temperament
that
is
the
noblest
and
the
most
magnanimous
in
its
very
moulding
whining
children
are
selfish
as
a
rule
and
and
most
often
incapable
of
enjoyment
which
last
is
a
gift
of
itself
that
goes
not
always
with
possession
among
other
accomplishments
ernie
had
the
power
of
mimicry
to
a
singular
degree
clayton
had
a
slight
hitch
in
her
gait
of
late
from
rheumatic
suffering
which
he
simulated
solemnly
notwithstanding
every
effort
on
my
part
to
restrain
him
without
a
smile
or
any
effort
of
mirth
he
would
limp
behind
as
she
walked
across
the
floor
unconscious
of
his
close
attendance
and
when
she
would
turn
suddenly
and
detect
him
and
shake
her
clinched
fist
at
him
half
in
jest
he
would
retaliate
by
a
similar
gesture
and
scowl
and
stamp
of
the
foot
that
so
nearly
resembled
her
own
proceedings
as
to
cause
me
much
internal
merriment
but
of
course
for
his
own
advantage
as
well
as
from
regard
for
her
feelings
it
was
necessary
for
me
on
such
occasions
to
assume
a
gravity
of
deportment
bordering
on
displeasure
it
may
be
supposed
then
that
when
on
the
morning
after
englehart
visit
before
my
chamber
had
been
swept
and
garnished
and
while
clayton
was
busy
in
her
own
ernie
brought
me
a
letter
and
laid
it
on
the
table
before
me
as
englehart
had
done
the
night
before
in
his
presence
i
was
infinitely
amused
what
then
was
my
surprise
in
stooping
over
it
to
find
this
letter
addressed
to
myself
in
the
unfamiliar
yet
character
of
wardour
wentworth
after
the
first
moment
of
bewilderment
i
opened
the
letter
closed
as
was
the
fashion
of
the
day
without
envelope
and
sealed
originally
with
wax
of
which
a
few
fragments
still
remained
alone
the
date
the
subject
the
earnest
contents
convinced
me
that
i
now
held
the
clew
of
that
mystery
which
had
baffled
me
so
long
and
that
the
missing
letter
said
to
have
been
lost
at
le
noir
landing
was
at
last
in
my
possession
it
needed
not
this
additional
proof
of
treachery
to
convince
me
that
my
suspicions
had
been
correct
and
that
next
to
the
bainrothe
i
owed
the
greatest
misery
of
my
life
to
him
who
in
his
disguise
had
dropped
this
letter
from
his
pocket
on
the
preceding
evening
my
evil
genius
englehart
luke
gregory
it
was
a
gracious
thing
in
god
to
permit
me
to
owe
the
great
happiness
of
this
discovery
to
the
little
crippled
child
he
had
cast
upon
my
care
so
mysteriously
and
i
failed
not
to
render
to
him
with
other
grateful
acknowledgments
most
humble
and
hearty
thanks
for
this
crowning
grace
henceforth
hope
should
lend
her
torch
to
light
my
dearth
her
wings
to
bear
me
up
her
anchor
wherewith
to
moor
my
bark
of
life
wherever
cast
and
to
the
poor
waif
i
cherished
i
owed
this
immeasurable
good
had
clayton
anticipated
him
with
her
infallible
besom
that
housewifely
detective
that
drags
more
secrets
to
light
than
ever
did
paid
policeman
i
should
never
have
grasped
this
talisman
of
love
and
hope
never
have
waked
up
as
i
did
wake
up
from
that
hour
to
the
endurance
which
immortalizes
endeavor
and
renders
patience
almost
pleasurable
on
the
back
of
this
letter
was
a
which
although
i
read
it
last
i
present
first
to
my
reader
that
he
may
trace
link
by
link
the
chain
of
villainy
that
bound
together
my
two
oppressors
it
was
in
the
small
clear
calligraphy
of
basil
bainrothe
before
described
characterized
i
believe
as
a
backhand
and
thus
it
ran
you
are
right
it
was
a
keep
them
in
ignorance
of
each
other
and
all
will
yet
go
well
i
sail
and
have
only
time
to
inclose
this
with
a
pencilled
line
try
and
head
them
at
new
york
my
first
idea
was
the
best
my
reason
i
will
explain
later
yours
truly
the
man
could
not
have
played
into
our
hands
better
than
by
taking
up
such
an
impression
there
is
no
one
there
to
undeceive
him
the
letter
my
miriam
your
note
through
the
hands
of
gregory
has
been
received
read
noted
pondered
over
with
pain
and
amazement
the
avowal
of
your
name
so
uselessly
withheld
from
me
lets
in
a
whole
flood
of
light
blinding
and
dazzling
too
on
a
subject
that
fills
me
with
infinite
solicitude
there
have
been
strange
reserves
between
us
that
never
ought
to
have
existed
on
my
part
as
well
as
yours
i
should
have
told
you
that
i
once
had
a
called
constance
glen
older
than
myself
by
many
years
who
married
during
my
long
absence
from
our
native
land
a
gentleman
much
older
than
herself
an
englishman
by
the
name
of
monfort
and
after
giving
birth
to
a
daughter
died
suddenly
these
particulars
i
gathered
from
strangers
but
there
were
many
wanting
which
you
can
best
supply
i
know
that
this
gentleman
had
a
daughter
or
daughters
by
an
earlier
marriage
and
i
can
find
no
clew
to
the
date
of
my
sister
marriage
which
might
in
itself
determine
the
possible
age
of
her
own
daughter
that
this
child
survived
i
have
painful
cause
to
remember
i
had
sustained
shipwreck
and
was
in
abeyance
for
clothes
and
money
both
when
it
occurred
to
me
to
call
on
my
present
to
him
my
credentials
and
remain
a
few
days
at
his
house
as
his
guest
in
the
enjoyment
of
my
sister
society
until
my
needs
could
be
supplied
from
certain
resources
at
a
distance
the
reception
i
met
with
from
his
elder
daughter
and
the
information
she
haughtily
gave
me
determined
my
course
i
sought
no
more
the
inhospitable
roof
of
monfort
to
find
shelter
beneath
which
i
had
forfeited
all
claim
by
the
death
of
my
sister
then
first
suddenly
revealed
to
me
her
child
i
was
told
had
been
recently
injured
by
burning
and
could
not
be
seen
even
by
so
near
a
relative
and
the
manner
of
the
young
lady
whom
i
now
identify
as
evelyn
monfort
was
such
as
to
lead
me
at
the
time
to
believe
this
a
mere
excuse
or
evasion
which
i
did
not
seek
to
oppose
it
is
just
possible
that
there
may
be
a
third
sister
yet
i
think
i
have
heard
you
say
you
had
but
one
and
this
reminiscence
is
anguish
to
my
mind
even
more
the
careless
and
unwarrantable
allusions
of
gregory
to
certain
scars
evidently
from
burns
that
he
had
the
insolence
to
observe
on
your
neck
and
arms
and
remark
upon
as
mere
foils
to
their
beauty
in
my
first
acquaintance
with
you
and
before
i
had
a
right
to
silence
him
recurred
to
me
as
a
partial
confirmation
of
my
fears
without
explaining
to
him
my
motives
i
questioned
him
on
this
subject
again
soon
after
he
handed
me
your
note
a
proceeding
that
i
should
have
shrunk
from
as
gross
and
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
under
any
other
circumstances
i
did
not
stop
to
think
what
impression
my
inquiries
would
leave
upon
his
mind
ever
prone
to
levity
and
suspicion
but
he
must
have
seen
that
i
was
deeply
moved
and
that
no
impertinent
curiosity
could
sway
me
to
such
a
course
with
regard
to
the
woman
i
loved
and
had
openly
declared
my
plighted
wife
you
will
understand
all
this
and
make
allowance
for
me
write
to
me
immediately
and
relieve
if
possible
my
intense
solicitude
at
all
events
let
me
know
the
truth
and
look
it
in
the
face
as
soon
as
may
be
any
reality
is
better
than
suspense
yet
i
must
against
hope
or
surrender
wholly
i
have
not
time
to
write
another
line
my
business
is
imperative
or
i
should
certainly
retrace
my
steps
yours
eternally
wentworth
the
man
who
wrote
this
letter
was
capable
of
condensing
in
a
few
calm
words
a
world
of
passion
whether
he
spoke
or
wrote
them
but
he
had
governed
his
pen
carefully
in
his
agonizing
uncertainty
it
was
yet
to
be
determined
when
he
penned
these
lines
whether
he
should
be
considered
a
lover
addressing
his
mistress
or
an
uncle
writing
to
his
niece
and
in
this
bitter
perplexity
he
commanded
his
inclinations
to
the
side
of
principle
i
wept
with
tears
of
joy
and
thankfulness
above
this
constrained
epistle
i
pressed
it
to
my
heart
my
lips
a
thousand
times
in
the
quiet
hours
of
night
in
the
moments
of
retirement
my
jailer
granted
me
the
child
ernie
alone
saw
and
wondered
at
these
manifestations
of
which
i
first
saw
the
extravagance
through
his
solemn
imitations
thereof
which
yet
made
me
catch
him
rapturously
in
my
arms
and
kiss
him
a
thousand
times
until
he
put
me
aside
at
last
with
decorous
dignity
as
one
transcending
privilege
by
some
vicarious
process
best
understood
by
lovers
i
lavished
on
little
ernie
a
thousand
terms
of
endearment
meant
only
for
another
and
by
the
light
of
my
own
happiness
he
seemed
transfigured
he
was
identified
with
the
lifting
away
of
a
burden
more
bitter
than
captivity
itself
they
could
but
kill
my
body
now
my
soul
was
filled
with
a
new
life
that
nothing
could
extinguish
and
believing
in
wentworth
i
felt
that
i
could
die
happy
let
death
come
when
and
how
it
would
i
knew
now
that
in
the
course
of
time
whether
i
lived
or
died
wentworth
would
know
that
i
was
not
his
niece
and
claim
mabel
as
his
own
remembering
my
estimate
of
those
who
held
her
in
charge
then
would
the
tide
of
love
and
passion
so
long
repressed
roll
back
in
its
old
channel
and
he
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
no
path
unexplored
whereby
to
trace
my
fate
to
this
as
yet
he
held
no
clew
the
sea
had
seemed
to
swallow
miriam
harz
by
which
name
i
had
been
registered
in
the
ship
books
and
known
to
the
passengers
nor
could
it
be
surmised
that
the
young
mad
girl
since
spoken
of
as
i
had
been
told
in
the
papers
as
having
been
restored
to
her
friends
by
the
accident
of
meeting
the
latona
and
miriam
monfort
were
one
and
the
same
person
but
if
the
time
should
come
when
all
should
be
explained
either
by
my
own
lips
or
the
revelations
of
others
good
cause
might
basil
bainrothe
and
his
confederate
have
to
tremble
like
all
cold
patient
men
there
were
untold
reserves
of
power
and
passion
in
the
nature
of
wardour
wentworth
which
might
for
aught
i
knew
to
the
contrary
tend
naturally
to
and
culminate
in
revenge
the
wish
to
retaliate
was
i
knew
a
fundamental
fault
in
my
own
character
one
i
had
often
occasion
to
struggle
with
even
in
childhood
when
evelyn
my
despot
was
also
my
dependant
and
generosity
had
been
called
to
the
aid
of
forbearance
vengeance
was
a
fierce
thirst
in
my
judaic
heart
which
only
christian
streams
could
ever
allay
or
quench
and
i
judged
the
man
i
loved
by
self
not
always
a
fitting
standard
of
comparison
and
gregory
i
could
imagine
well
the
fiendish
delight
with
which
he
had
seen
me
day
by
day
writhing
uncomplainingly
beneath
the
unexplained
and
as
i
had
deemed
unsuspected
alienation
of
wentworth
the
cause
of
which
his
act
had
wrapped
in
mystery
afraid
to
tamper
with
the
note
i
gave
him
for
the
cool
discerning
eye
of
wentworth
curiosity
had
at
first
led
him
to
break
the
seal
of
that
intrusted
to
his
care
in
return
and
dark
malevolence
to
retain
it
rather
than
destroy
for
the
eye
of
his
confederate
that
he
had
dispatched
it
at
once
for
paris
was
very
evident
from
the
pencilling
on
the
back
of
the
letter
and
that
the
snare
was
set
for
me
already
in
which
the
accident
of
the
encountered
raft
proved
an
assistant
i
could
not
doubt
i
fell
into
the
hands
of
bainrothe
on
shipboard
instead
of
into
those
of
gregory
in
new
york
this
was
the
only
difference
for
subterfuge
could
have
done
its
work
as
well
if
not
as
daringly
on
land
as
on
sea
and
the
league
of
iniquity
was
made
before
i
sailed
from
savannah
how
perfectly
i
could
comprehend
for
the
first
time
since
this
revelation
what
wentworth
must
have
suffered
beneath
his
burden
of
unrelieved
doubt
and
conjecture
i
could
see
how
day
by
day
as
no
answer
came
to
change
the
current
of
his
thoughts
conviction
slowly
settled
down
like
a
cloud
upon
his
heart
his
reason
and
what
stern
confirmation
of
all
he
dreaded
most
my
silence
must
have
seemed
to
him
all
this
i
saw
in
my
mental
survey
with
pity
with
concern
with
wild
desire
to
fly
to
him
and
whisper
truth
and
consolation
in
his
arms
for
i
loved
this
man
as
it
is
given
to
passionate
earnest
natures
to
love
but
once
be
it
early
or
late
loved
him
as
eve
loved
adam
when
the
whole
inhabited
earth
was
given
to
those
two
alone
you
seem
in
very
good
spirits
miss
monfort
said
clayton
with
unusual
asperity
on
one
occasion
when
holding
ernie
in
my
arms
i
lavished
endearments
upon
him
your
king
indeed
your
angel
i
really
believe
you
admire
as
well
as
love
that
hideous
little
elf
of
course
i
do
clayton
all
things
i
love
are
beautiful
to
me
and
i
remembered
how
bertie
plain
face
had
grown
into
touching
loveliness
in
my
sight
from
the
affection
i
bore
her
and
do
you
really
love
this
child
most
certainly
and
very
tenderly
too
is
he
not
my
sweetest
consolation
in
this
dreary
life
what
if
they
remove
him
ah
what
indeed
and
relaxing
my
grasp
i
clasped
my
hands
together
patiently
that
thought
had
occurred
to
me
before
it
is
a
very
strong
affection
to
have
sprung
up
from
a
short
acquaintance
on
a
raft
she
remarked
sententiously
i
saved
his
infant
life
you
know
and
the
benefactor
always
loves
the
thing
he
benefits
it
is
on
this
principle
alone
god
loves
his
erring
creatures
clayton
rest
assured
if
you
had
loved
the
child
with
true
friendship
you
would
have
pushed
him
into
the
sea
rather
than
have
held
him
in
your
arms
above
it
do
you
suppose
he
is
less
near
to
god
than
you
or
i
to
christ
the
i
questioned
sternly
much
rather
would
i
have
that
infant
yet
unconscious
hope
of
heaven
than
either
yours
or
mine
mrs
clayton
but
his
earthly
hope
it
was
that
i
alluded
to
what
chance
for
him
poor
weakly
deformed
he
had
better
be
at
rest
than
knocked
from
pillar
to
poet
as
he
must
be
in
this
hard
cold
world
of
chance
and
change
and
that
shall
never
be
while
i
live
ernie
i
said
taking
him
again
in
my
lap
at
his
silent
solicitation
why
clayton
with
such
a
noble
soul
such
intelligence
as
this
child
possesses
he
may
fill
a
pulpit
and
save
erring
souls
or
write
such
beautiful
poems
and
romances
as
shall
thrill
the
heart
or
draw
from
an
instrument
sounds
as
divine
as
de
beriot
or
paint
a
picture
and
immortalize
his
name
there
is
nothing
too
good
too
great
for
ernie
to
do
should
god
grant
him
life
to
achieve
and
as
surely
as
i
am
spared
to
be
enfranchised
shall
i
make
this
gifted
child
my
charge
you
are
perfectly
infatuated
miss
monfort
i
declare
i
shall
begin
to
believe
no
you
shall
not
begin
to
believe
any
such
thing
i
interrupted
her
smiling
you
are
surely
too
sensible
and
just
a
woman
to
begin
to
believe
fallacies
thus
late
in
the
day
have
it
your
own
way
she
said
sharply
you
always
get
the
better
of
me
at
last
not
always
i
pursued
or
i
should
not
be
here
you
know
it
rests
with
you
to
keep
or
let
me
go
to
ruin
my
child
husband
there
now
you
have
my
she
said
with
a
desperate
gesture
use
it
as
you
will
i
understood
more
than
ever
the
hopelessness
of
my
case
from
the
moment
of
that
impulsive
revelation
to
which
i
made
no
answer
what
is
more
she
said
huskily
i
too
am
watched
i
never
knew
this
until
two
days
ago
a
negro
man
an
attendant
of
the
house
an
old
servant
of
your
guardian
i
believe
guards
the
doors
below
and
refuses
to
let
me
pass
to
and
fro
dinah
even
is
employed
to
dog
my
steps
this
is
not
exactly
what
i
bargained
for
yet
in
spite
of
all
on
her
account
i
shall
be
faithful
to
the
end
and
for
a
time
she
busied
herself
in
that
careful
dusting
of
the
ornaments
of
the
chamber
which
seemed
mechanical
so
habitual
was
it
to
her
sense
of
order
and
tidiness
her
hand
was
on
the
bible
i
remember
and
her
bunch
of
plumes
lifted
above
it
as
if
for
immediate
action
when
her
arm
fell
heavily
to
her
side
and
she
heaved
a
bitter
sigh
so
deep
it
sounded
like
a
sob
rather
to
my
ear
if
i
could
only
think
you
did
not
hate
me
miss
miriam
she
said
i
believe
i
could
be
better
satisfied
to
lead
the
life
i
do
hate
you
why
should
i
hate
you
clayton
you
are
only
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
my
persecutor
i
know
from
your
own
confession
and
i
understand
your
motive
better
in
the
last
few
moments
than
i
did
before
inadequate
as
it
seems
to
my
sense
of
justice
for
aiding
this
oppressor
you
have
been
very
kind
to
me
in
some
respects
an
inferior
person
could
have
tortured
in
a
thousand
ways
where
you
have
shown
yourself
considerate
delicate
even
and
for
all
this
i
thank
you
more
than
i
can
express
i
should
be
very
ungrateful
indeed
were
i
to
hate
you
the
word
is
strong
yet
you
prefer
even
that
child
to
me
or
my
society
she
said
peevishly
the
comparison
can
not
be
instituted
with
any
propriety
i
responded
gravely
turning
away
and
dismissing
the
boy
to
his
blocks
and
books
as
i
did
so
which
made
for
him
i
knew
a
fairy
kingdom
of
delight
through
the
aid
of
his
splendid
imagination
a
commonplace
infant
will
tire
of
the
choicest
toys
they
are
to
such
minds
but
effigies
and
delusion
which
last
the
delight
of
imaginative
infancy
to
the
cut
and
dried
dull
childish
understanding
is
impossible
i
once
overheard
one
little
girl
at
a
theatre
a
splendid
spectacle
calculated
to
dazzle
and
delight
imaginative
childhood
say
to
another
it
is
nothing
but
that
house
and
garden
are
only
painted
see
how
they
shake
and
the
women
are
dressed
in
paste
jewelry
like
that
our
wears
to
parties
and
no
jeweler
would
give
a
cent
for
them
and
the
fairies
are
poor
girls
dressed
up
for
the
occasion
and
the
whole
play
is
made
up
as
they
go
you
see
i
know
all
about
it
father
says
i
heard
no
more
but
had
a
glimpse
of
a
little
eager
face
suddenly
dashed
in
its
expression
and
of
small
fingers
pressed
to
unwilling
ears

a

could
imagine
him

the

of
asinine
wisdom
so
to
speak
the
quintessence
of
the
practical
which
so
often
i
observe

its
devotees

very
well

chapter

the
six
weeks
which
had
been
allotted
to
me
as
the
term
of
my
captivity
were
accomplished
and
still
mr
basil
bainrothe
came
not
wrote
not
i
had
seen
the
month
of
august
glide
away
its
progress
marked
only
by
the
changing
fruits
and
flowers
of
the
season
and
the
more
fervent
light
that
pierced
through
the
venetian
blinds
when
turned
heavenward
for
it
was
through
these
alone
that
the
light
of
day
was
permitted
to
visit
my
chamber
where
then
was
the
place
of
my
captivity
situated
in
the
environs
of
a
great
city
possibly
for
the
wind
often
blew
laden
with
fragrance
as
from
choice
rather
than
extensive
gardens
through
my
casement
and
the
shadow
of
a
tall
tree
impending
over
the
skylight
of
the
was
when
windy
cast
so
distinctly
on
its
panes
as
to
convince
me
of
the
neighborhood
of
an
english
elm
the
foliage
of
which
tree
i
knew
like
an
alphabet
and
then
those
fairy
sabbath
chimes
were
such
musical
bells
duplicated
in
adjacent
cities
or
was
i
indeed
near
our
old
beloved
church
in
which
memory
so
distinctly
revealed
our
ancient
pew
my
father
bowed
head
and
the
venerable
pastor
rising
and
saintly
in
his
pulpit
to
bid
all
the
earth
keep
silent
before
the
lord
conjecture
was
rife
thus
august
passed
away
my
birthday
had
gone
by
and
the
equinox
was
upon
us
with
its
rapid
changes
of
sun
and
storm
when
one
of
these
tempests
accompanied
by
hail
of
unusual
size
shattered
to
fragments
the
skylight
of
the
this
was
succeeded
by
a
deluge
of
rain
which
flooded
not
only
the
adjacent
closet
but
the
chamber
i
occupied
among
other
evils
completely
submerging
the
superb
wilton
carpet
concerning
the
safety
of
which
clayton
felt
immense
responsibility
a
glazier
came
as
soon
as
the
weather
permitted
who
was
carefully
escorted
through
my
chamber
by
clayton
to
ascertain
the
repairs
to
be
made
a
irish
lad
i
remember
for
a
human
being
was
a
novelty
to
me
then
who
found
it
necessary
in
order
to
repaint
the
to
bear
the
sash
away
with
him
leaving
behind
his
tray
of
chisels
and
putty
and
the
light
he
had
brought
with
him
on
his
shoulder
and
on
whose
return
i
vainly
waited
as
a
chance
for
communication
with
the
outer
world
while
dinah
was
busy
with
mops
and
brooms
drying
the
carpet
and
clayton
thoroughly
occupied
with
her
active
superintendence
of
the
needful
operations
little
mischievous
meddlesome
ernie
had
made
his
way
contrary
to
all
rules
beneath
and
behind
my
bed
and
torn
off
a
goodly
portion
of
the
gray
and
gilded
paper
which
had
so
far
effectually
aided
to
conceal
a
closed
door
situated
behind
the
from
which
the
frame
had
been
removed
then
for
the
first
time
since
our
acquaintance
did
i
slap
sharply
those
little
busy
fingers
which
i
could
have
kissed
for
thankfulness
and
watching
my
opportunity
i
replaced
the
paper
unseen
by
clayton
with
the
remains
of
a
draught
which
had
been
prescribed
for
his
cough
i
knew
that
after
experiencing
such
condign
punishment
he
would
return
no
more
to
the
scene
of
his
destruction
and
that
he
might
forget
both
injury
and
discovery
i
devoted
myself
to
his
amusement
during
that
active
long
rainy
day
with
success
the
glazier
had
announced
to
clayton
that
his
return
might
be
deferred
for
hours
and
as
the
succeeding
day
was
clear
and
warm
i
proceeded
in
spite
of
broken
sashes
to
take
my
daily
bath
as
usual
at
twelve
clayton
with
her
in
her
pocket
and
her
snuffbox
at
hand
yielded
herself
to
the
delight
of
and
her
and
rested
calmly
after
her
fatigues
of
the
preceding
day
and
ernie
attracted
by
the
crunching
noise
the
sound
of
dropping
nuts
perhaps
which
betrayed
the
presence
of
his
favorite
article
of
food
hastened
to
keep
her
company
a
thing
he
never
did
disinterestedly
it
most
be
confessed
an
opportunity
now
presented
itself
for
observation
which
i
knew
might
not
again
occur
during
my
whole
captivity
and
surely
no
sailor
ever
ascended
to
the
of
the
pinta
with
a
heart
more
heaved
with
emotion
than
was
mine
as
i
placed
my
foot
on
the
last
rung
of
the
ladder
and
towered
from
my
waist
upward
above
the
skylight
i
had
drawn
the
bolt
within
as
i
invariably
did
while
bathing
and
with
a
feeling
of
proud
security
i
stood
and
surveyed
the
scene
beneath
and
around
me
the
angle
of
vision
did
not
it
is
true
embrace
objects
immediately
below
me
owing
to
the
projecting
cornices
of
the
flat
roof
a
mere
excrescence
from
the
original
structure
as
this
was
but
beyond
this
the
eye
swept
for
some
distance
uninterruptedly
bathed
in
the
golden
light
of
that
autumn
noonday
sun
i
saw
and
recognized
a
scene
and
for
a
moment
i
reeled
on
the
slender
step
as
i
did
so
and
all
grew
dark
around
me
but
with
one
of
those
energetic
impulses
that
come
to
us
all
in
time
of
emergency
i
recovered
my
balance
in
time
to
save
myself
from
falling
and
eagerly
and
wistfully
as
looks
the
dying
wretch
on
the
dear
faces
he
is
soon
to
see
no
more
i
gazed
upon
the
paradise
from
which
fiends
had
driven
me
there
indeed
just
as
i
had
left
it
lay
the
grassy
lawn
with
its
its
laburnums
and
white
and
purple
lilacs
and
drooping
bushes
and
its
great
english
towering
like
a
titan
in
the
centre
there
was
the
my
father
hand
had
planted
and
the
my
mother
had
set
in
memory
of
her
dead
whose
graves
were
far
away
and
there
towered
the
lofty
with
their
long
low
sweeping
branches
meeting
in
friendly
greeting
to
two
of
which
a
swing
had
once
been
attached
as
a
bond
of
union
a
swing
in
which
it
had
once
been
my
childish
pleasure
to
sway
and
read
while
mabel
sat
beside
me
with
her
head
upon
my
shoulder
held
securely
in
her
place
by
my
strong
loving
encircling
arm
nor
were
these
all
to
assure
me
that
after
a
year
of
melancholy
and
eventful
absence
i
looked
again
upon
the
precincts
of
home
a
little
farther
on
rose
the
gray
wall
and
tower
of
the
library
and
belfry
half
concealed
by
its
heavy
coating
of
ivy
glossy
and
dark
and
shutting
away
all
other
view
of
the
mansion
beyond
these
last
was
the
pavilion
my
father
had
built
for
the
playhouse
of
his
children
through
the
open
of
which
i
saw
a
girl
seated
at
her
work
with
graceful
bending
neck
and
face
a
moment
later
claude
bainrothe
lounged
across
the
sward
cigar
in
hand
at
his
approach
the
face
within
was
turned
and
i
recognized
at
a
glance
that
of
my
young
companion
of
the
raft
ada
greene
then
gazing
cautiously
around
as
if
to
elude
observation
never
dreaming
of
the
eye
dropped
like
a
bird
upon
him
he
lifted
the
rosy
face
in
his
hand
and
kissed
it
thrice
right
loverly
i
saw
no
more
i
would
not
witness
more
for
had
i
not
learned
already
all
that
i
asked
or
ought
to
know
well
might
the
dear
old
chimes
ring
out
their
sabbath
welcome
to
one
who
had
obeyed
their
summons
from
her
childhood
up
to
womanhood
well
might
the
summer
air
bear
on
its
wings
greeting
of
familiar
odors
lost
and
found
this
was
no
idle
dream
no
mirage
of
a
vagrant
brain
like
that
or
that
wild
vision
at
beauseincourt
but
sober
and
sad
and
strange
reality
i
understood
my
position
from
that
moment
geographically
as
well
as
physically
i
was
a
prisoner
in
the
house
of
basil
bainrothe
while
he
perchance
reigned
lordly
in
my
own
that
house
whose
hidden
arcana
i
had
never
explored
and
which
beyond
its
parlor
and
exterior
was
to
me
as
the
dwelling
of
a
stranger
derisively
deferential
he
had
resigned
to
me
this
secluded
chamber
in
the
ell
his
own
particular
sanctum
i
remember
to
have
heard
and
betaken
himself
in
all
probability
to
the
more
spacious
mansion
of
his
former
neighbor
far
wiser
even
if
sadder
than
i
went
up
its
rounds
did
i
descend
that
ladder
half
an
hour
after
i
had
entered
it
and
with
new
hope
i
emerged
from
the
as
fresh
as
a
naiad
having
first
abstracted
from
the
of
the
glazier
two
tiny
chisels
of
different
sizes
and
a
small
lump
of
putty
which
i
secreted
on
my
first
opportunity
in
my
favorite
a
hollow
in
the
post
of
my
bedstead
an
accidental
discovery
of
mine
made
during
clayton
first
illness
since
which
i
had
always
insisted
on
making
up
my
own
bed
much
to
her
relief
my
conscience
so
disturbed
me
on
the
score
of
this
theft
that
i
hastened
to
secrete
my
only
remaining
piece
of
gold
in
the
box
as
this
appeared
to
me
on
reflection
the
boy
was
an
apprentice
evidently
and
might
else
i
thought
at
the
time
have
been
the
loser
i
feared
to
add
a
line
and
dared
not
seek
a
passing
word
with
him
so
carefully
was
i
watched
i
next
examined
with
the
eye
of
scientific
scrutiny
two
massive
rulers
that
lay
on
my
table
one
made
of
and
the
other
of
ebony
and
having
selected
the
first
as
most
available
for
my
purpose
prepared
to
commence
the
most
arduous
undertaking
of
my
life
the
careful
shaping
of
a
wooden
key
i
had
read
somewhere
that
during
the
french
revolution
a
young
by
means
of
such
an
instrument
had
set
at
large
her
lover
or
her
brother
in
having
taken
with
soft
wax
the
outline
of
the
wards
of
the
lock
in
a
moment
of
opportunity
that
day
my
work
began
three
times
a
failure
but
at
last
successful
with
the
aid
of
putty
gradually
allowed
to
harden
i
obtained
the
mould
i
desired
in
the
dead
of
night
and
afterward
whenever
privacy
even
for
a
few
minutes
was
mine
i
drew
from
my
bosom
my
sacred
piece
of
sculpture
and
worked
upon
it
with
knife
and
chisel
alternately
as
devotee
never
worked
on
sculptured
crucifix
never
shall
i
forget
the
rapture
the
ecstasy
of
that
moment
in
which
ensconced
between
my
and
the
wall
i
slowly
turned
the
key
first
thoroughly
soaked
in
oil
in
the
morticed
wards
and
knew
by
the
slight
giving
of
the
door
that
it
was
unlocked
not
ali
baba
when
be
entered
the
robbers
cave
and
saw
the
heaps
of
gold
all
his
by
the
force
of
one
magic
word
not
aladdin
when
the
genius
of
the
lamp
rose
to
his
bidding
bearing
salvers
of
jewels
which
were
to
purchase
for
him
the
hand
of
the
sultan
daughter
not
sindbad
when
he
saw
the
light
which
led
him
to
the
aperture
of
egress
from
the
sepulchre
in
which
he
had
been
pent
up
with
his
wife
body
to
die
knew
keener
or
more
triumphant
sensations
than
filled
my
bosom
as
i
laid
that
completed
key
next
my
heart
after
turning
it
cautiously
backward
and
forward
in
my
i
dared
not
at
that
time
draw
back
the
bolt
above
that
confined
it
loosely
yet
securely
or
turn
the
silver
knob
sufficiently
to
set
it
even
ever
so
little
ajar
but
i
did
both
later
when
oil
had
time
to
do
its
subtle
work
and
i
could
effect
my
experiment
in
silence
yet
i
hazarded
nothing
of
the
sort
when
the
quick
ear
of
clayton
held
watch
in
the
adjoining
room
i
was
obliged
to
take
advantage
of
those
moments
of
rare
absence
when
the
doors
of
her
chamber
both
inner
and
outer
she
would
descend
for
a
few
minutes
to
the
realms
below
returning
so
suddenly
and
silently
as
almost
to
surprise
me
on
one
or
two
occasions
at
my
work
about
the
time
of
the
completion
of
my
experiment
i
became
aware
of
sounds
in
the
room
beneath
my
chamber
and
sometimes
on
the
great
stairway
of
which
i
now
knew
the
largest
platform
was
situated
very
near
the
head
of
my
bed
that
gave
token
of
occupancy
the
rattling
of
china
and
silver
might
be
discerned
in
the
ancient
at
morn
and
night
the
occupant
probably
dined
elsewhere
but
the
regularity
of
these
meals
was
unmistakable
i
recognized
faintly
the
step
of
bainrothe
on
the
stairway
distinguishing
it
readily
from
any
other
as
it
passed
and
repassed
my
hidden
door
october
had
now
set
in
with
a
chilliness
unusual
to
that
bland
season
and
i
asked
for
and
obtained
permission
to
have
a
fire
kindled
in
the
wide
and
gloomy
grate
of
my
chamber
hitherto
unused
by
me
about
this
household
flame
ernie
clayton
and
i
gathered
harmoniously
she
with
her
unfailing
i
with
book
or
pencil
the
baby
with
his
blocks
and
dominoes
and
painted
pictures
the
only
happy
and
truly
industrious
spirit
of
the
group
my
true
work
was
done
else
might
it
never
have
been
completed
the
presence
of
fire
was
indispensable
to
clayton
and
from
the
time
of
its
first
lighting
she
left
me
but
seldom
alone
her
rheumatic
limbs
needed
the
solace
that
i
had
no
heart
to
grudge
her
distasteful
as
she
was
to
me
and
becoming
more
so
day
by
day
false
as
i
now
knew
her
to
be
false
at
heart
how
hatred
grows
when
we
once
admit
the
germ
not
like
love
parasitically
but
strong
stanch
stern
alone
throwing
down
fresh
roots
even
hour
by
hour
like
the
banyan
monarch
of
the
eastern
forest
i
am
afraid
i
have
a
turn
for
this
passion
naturally
but
for
love
as
well
ten
times
more
intense
so
that
one
pretty
well
counterbalances
the
other
to
carry
out
the
i
might
as
well
add
at
once
that
in
the
end
the
parasitical
plant
has
triumphed
and
stifled
the
sterner
growth
in
other
words
christianity
has
conquered
judaism
i
suppose
i
may
soon
expect
a
visit
from
bainrothe
i
said
one
day
to
clayton
i
think
my
birthday
approaches
can
you
tell
me
the
day
of
the
month
i
know
that
of
the
week
from
remembering
the
sabbath
chimes
i
thought
she
started
slightly
at
this
announcement
but
she
replied
unflinchingly
the
yes
i
am
quite
sure
it
is
the
of
the
month
do
you
never
see
a
newspaper
clayton
and
if
so
can
you
not
indulge
me
with
a
glimpse
of
one
i
think
it
would
do
me
good
remind
me
that
i
was
alive
i
have
seen
none
since
the
account
of
miss
safety
for
which
god
be
praised
no
miss
monfort
it
is
simply
impossible
i
should
be
transgressing
the
rules
of
the
establishment
englehart
i
suppose
as
if
indeed
there
were
such
a
person
i
said
impetuously
unguardedly
do
you
pretend
to
doubt
it
she
asked
slowly
setting
her
greedy
eyes
upon
my
face
and
dropping
her
and
shell
upon
her
knee
why
what
possesses
you
miss
miriam
i
shall
answer
no
questions
clayton
this
right
at
least
i
reserve
but
the
fact
is
i
doubt
every
thing
lately
except
this
child
and
god
i
do
not
believe
my
creator
will
forsake
me
utterly
i
shall
not
till
the
end
and
tears
rolled
down
my
face
the
first
i
had
shed
for
days
i
had
been
petrified
of
late
by
the
resolution
i
was
making
and
the
effort
of
mind
it
had
cost
me
i
had
felt
until
now
that
i
was
hardening
into
atone
you
desire
to
see
bainrothe
i
suppose
she
remarked
after
a
long
silence
daring
which
she
had
again
betaken
herself
to
her
occupation
without
lifting
her
eyes
as
she
asked
the
question
i
desire
to
look
my
fate
in
the
face
at
once
and
understand
his
conditions
i
replied
sullenly
but
what
if
he
is
not
here
what
if
englehart
lifting
her
eyes
to
mine
i
can
not
be
mistaken
i
interrupted
with
impetuosity
i
have
heard
his
step
he
eats
in
the
room
below
i
am
convinced
for
i
know
of
old
that
bronchial
cough
of
his
the
effect
of
gormandism
then
suddenly
ernie
looking
up
made
a
revelation
irrelevant
yet
to
my
ear
terrible
and
astounding
but
fortunately
incomprehensible
to
my
companion
what
did
that
little
vigilant
creature
ever
fail
to
remark
mirry
make
tea
he
said
or
seemed
to
say
and
my
face
paled
and
flushed
alternately
until
my
brain
swam
make
tea
sail
the
voice
of
clayton
apparently
at
a
great
distance
no
i
will
make
the
tea
ernie
as
long
as
we
stay
together
mirry
does
not
know
how
to
draw
tea
like
an
englishwoman
oh
fortunate
misunderstanding
how
great
was
the
reaction
it
occasioned
from
an
almost
fainting
condition
i
rallied
to
vivacity
and
for
long
weary
hours
sat
pointing
out
pictures
to
the
boy
to
win
him
to
oblivion
and
persuade
him
to
silence
singularly
enough
but
not
unusual
with
him
he
never
resumed
the
topic
i
had
taken
pains
to
hide
my
work
from
his
observing
eyes
and
how
he
knew
it
unless
he
lay
silently
and
watched
me
from
his
little
bed
when
i
worked
at
early
dawn
in
mine
i
never
could
conjecture
a
few
days
later
clayton
announced
to
me
that
bainrothe
would
call
very
shortly
it
was
early
morning
i
remember
when
she
laid
before
me
the
card
of
basil
bainrothe
with
its
elaborate
german
characters
on
which
was
written
in
pencil
the
addendum
will
call
at
ten
and
punctual
as
the
hand
to
the
hour
he
knocked
at
the
door
at
the
appointed
time
and
was
admitted
he
entered
with
that
light
jaunty
step
peculiar
to
him
and
which
i
have
consequently
ever
associated
in
others
with
impudence
and
guile
hat
and
cane
in
the
left
hand
he
entered
two
fingers
of
the
right
raised
to
his
lips
by
way
of
salutation
he
clinched
his
glove
in
the
remainder
to
be
offered
to
me
later
and
ignored
completely
then
waved
carelessly
as
if
condoning
the
offense
he
was
quite
a
picture
as
he
came
in
a
and
as
such
i
coolly
regarded
him
fresh
fair
and
smiling
looking
younger
if
possible
than
when
we
parted
a
year
before
and
handsome
as
that
word
goes
in
his
debonair
style
of
appearance
he
was
dressed
with
even
more
than
his
usual
care
and
trimness
wore
boots
my
aversion
from
that
hour
for
these
were
the
first
i
had
ever
seen
and
pantaloons
very
tightly
strapped
down
over
them
a
glossy
black
coat
and
vest
and
linen
of
unimpeachable
quality
and
whiteness
while
a
chain
of
fine
venetian
gold
held
his
watch
or
or
both
in
suspension
from
his
neck
yet
no
beggar
in
rags
ever
appeared
to
me
half
so
loathly
as
did
this
speckless
dandy
you
have
come
i
said
grimly
as
he
settled
his
to
speak
to
me
after
formally
depositing
his
hat
and
cane
and
a
roll
of
paper
he
drew
from
his
pocket
on
the
and
wiping
his
face
carefully
with
his
cambric
handkerchief
unspeakably
odious
and
unclean
to
my
olfactories
you
have
come
at
last
yet
the
greatest
wonder
to
me
is
how
you
dare
appear
at
all
before
me
and
i
looked
upon
him
right
lionly
i
believe
you
were
always
inclined
to
assume
the
offensive
with
me
miriam
yet
i
confess
you
have
a
little
shadow
of
reason
this
time
or
seem
to
have
and
i
am
here
for
purposes
of
explanation
or
compromise
bowing
gracefully
and
he
rubbed
his
palms
together
very
gently
and
complacently
looking
around
as
he
did
so
for
a
chair
which
perceiving
and
drawing
to
the
table
so
as
to
face
me
where
i
eat
on
the
sofa
he
deposited
himself
upon
assuming
at
once
his
usual
graceful
pose
it
was
and
he
threw
one
arm
over
that
of
the
chair
suffering
his
white
hand
always
suggestive
of
poultices
to
me
with
its
signet
ring
to
droop
in
front
of
it
a
hand
which
he
moved
up
and
down
habitually
as
he
conversed
in
a
singularly
soothing
and
mechanical
fashion
his
pendulum
we
used
to
call
it
in
old
times
evelyn
and
i
when
it
was
one
of
our
chief
resources
for
amusement
to
laugh
at
cagliostro
our
for
this
jeune
it
may
be
remembered
let
me
premise
miriam
he
began
by
congratulating
you
on
your
improved
appearance
another
benign
bow
you
were
so
burned
and
blackened
by
exposure
and
so
in
short
so
very
when
i
last
saw
you
that
i
began
to
fear
for
the
result
but
perfect
rest
and
retirement
and
good
nursing
have
effected
wonders
i
have
never
seen
you
so
fair
so
and
yet
so
calm
as
you
are
now
calmness
my
child
is
aristocratic
cultivate
it
even
if
a
little
thin
and
delicate
from
confinement
yet
perfectly
healthy
i
can
not
doubt
from
what
i
see
do
assure
me
of
your
health
my
dear
girl
you
are
as
dumb
as
grey
celebrated
prophetess
all
personal
remarks
as
coming
from
you
are
offensive
to
me
bainrothe
i
rejoined
proceed
to
your
business
at
once
whatever
that
may
be
a
truce
to
preamble
and
compliments
you
shall
be
obeyed
he
remarked
bowing
low
and
derisively
yet
believe
me
nothing
but
my
care
for
your
fair
fame
and
my
own
have
led
me
to
confine
you
in
such
narrow
limits
for
a
season
which
i
trust
is
almost
over
as
to
my
persecutions
which
i
am
told
you
allege
as
a
reason
for
leaving
your
house
and
friends
so
precipitately
these
are
out
of
the
question
henceforth
forever
i
assure
you
with
a
wave
of
the
velvet
hand
since
i
am
privately
married
to
a
lady
of
rank
and
fortune
who
will
soon
be
openly
proclaimed
wife
and
who
will
be
found
on
close
acquaintance
worthy
of
your
friendship
while
giving
utterance
to
this
tirade
bainrothe
was
slowly
unwinding
a
string
from
around
the
roll
of
papers
he
had
laid
on
the
table
and
which
he
now
proceeded
to
spread
somewhat
ostentatiously
before
me
still
mute
and
impassive
to
all
his
advances
as
i
continued
to
be
there
are
several
he
said
your
signature
to
each
will
be
required
which
now
that
you
are
in
your
right
mind
again
and
of
age
will
be
binding
as
you
know
my
witnesses
shall
be
called
in
when
the
time
comes
englehart
and
clayton
will
suffice
as
proofs
of
these
solemnities
these
and
others
likely
to
occur
solemnities
levities
mockeries
rather
i
could
not
help
rejoining
he
felt
the
sarcasm
his
florid
cheek
paled
with
anger
his
eyes
glowed
with
lurid
fire
he
compressed
his
lips
bitterly
as
he
said
marriage
is
usually
considered
a
solemnity
miss
monfort
and
let
me
assure
you
it
is
only
as
a
married
woman
i
can
conscientiously
release
you
from
confinement
you
have
shown
yourself
too
erratic
to
be
intrusted
in
future
with
your
own
liberties
possibly
i
rejoined
yet
i
mean
to
have
the
selection
let
me
assure
you
in
return
of
the
controller
of
my
liberties
nay
have
already
selected
him
for
aught
you
know
my
cool
audacity
seemed
for
a
moment
to
paralyze
even
his
own
he
paused
and
surveyed
me
as
if
in
doubt
of
his
own
senses
i
heard
him
murmur
softly
and
turning
to
the
he
left
me
for
a
time
to
master
the
contents
of
the
three
documents
over
which
i
was
bending
i
read
them
in
order
as
they
were
numbered
and
became
more
and
more
indignant
as
their
meaning
opened
upon
my
brain
and
culminated
at
last
in
a
sharp
sudden
exclamation
of
utter
disdain
i
started
from
my
chair
and
approached
him
paper
in
hand
i
think
for
a
few
moments
the
idea
of
personal
danger
possessed
him
and
the
vision
of
a
concealed
dirk
or
pistol
swam
before
his
eyes
which
he
shielded
with
his
hand
while
he
placed
a
chair
between
us
and
truth
to
say
there
was
murder
in
my
heart
and
in
my
eyes
as
well
i
suppose
even
if
the
mistrust
went
no
further
i
could
have
obliterated
him
from
the
face
of
the
earth
at
that
moment
as
remorselessly
as
if
he
had
been
a
viper
in
my
path
striking
to
sting
me
yet
i
advanced
toward
him
with
no
demonstration
or
intentions
of
this
kind
having
the
habits
of
breeding
and
usual
innocence
of
weapons
and
ignorance
of
the
use
thereof
as
well
to
restrain
me
i
forget
close
to
my
heart
lay
one
of
the
sharp
shining
chisels
i
had
taken
from
the
glazier
in
the
what
is
it
you
object
to
miriam
he
asked
in
faltering
tones
as
his
hand
fell
and
his
glimmering
eyes
encountered
mine
from
that
day
i
have
believed
the
legend
which
tells
that
when
the
roman
helpless
in
his
dungeon
thundered
forth
slave
darest
thou
kill
caius
marius
the
armed
minion
of
murder
turned
and
fled
dropping
the
knife
he
held
in
his
panic
at
the
feet
of
the
man
he
came
to
slay
almost
such
effect
was
for
a
time
observable
in
basil
bainrothe
it
made
me
smile
bitterly
all
every
thing
i
answered
the
whole
requisition
from
first
to
last
is
base
dastardly
too
if
seen
with
discriminating
eyes
why
if
innocent
of
fraud
toward
me
and
mine
should
you
ask
a
formal
acknowledgment
on
my
part
as
to
your
just
administration
of
my
affairs
and
a
recantation
of
all
i
have
said
to
the
contrary
both
with
regard
to
yourself
and
evelyn
erle
such
are
the
contents
of
this
first
paper
the
only
one
that
i
could
under
any
possible
circumstances
be
induced
to
sign
as
a
compromise
with
your
villainy
for
not
to
gain
my
own
life
or
liberty
will
i
ever
put
hand
to
the
others
infamous
as
they
are
on
the
very
surface
miriam
this
violence
surprises
me
is
wholly
unlooked
for
and
unnecessary
he
remarked
mildly
from
what
clayton
has
told
me
i
had
supposed
that
my
disinterested
care
and
assiduity
with
regard
to
your
condition
were
about
to
meet
their
reward
in
your
rational
submission
to
the
necessities
of
your
case
and
mine
resume
your
seat
i
entreat
you
and
let
us
calmly
discuss
a
matter
that
seems
to
agitate
you
so
unduly
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
place
it
before
you
in
a
better
light
ere
we
have
concluded
our
interview
you
will
sit
down
again
miriam
will
you
not
oh
surely
if
you
are
alarmed
but
really
i
should
suppose
with
clayton
and
englehart
no
doubt
in
call
you
need
not
be
so
tremulous
there
you
are
quite
safe
i
assure
you
in
your
old
place
with
the
table
between
us
and
i
pointed
derisively
to
he
had
occupied
so
gracefully
a
few
moments
before
and
into
which
he
now
slowly
subsided
contemptuous
girl
he
broke
forth
at
last
you
may
yet
live
to
regret
this
behavior
so
far
nothing
has
been
denied
you
no
expense
has
been
spared
for
your
comfort
in
a
tribunal
of
justice
you
could
say
this
no
more
guardian
thinking
me
mad
from
his
experiences
of
my
conduct
and
health
and
regaining
accidental
possession
of
me
at
a
time
when
under
a
feigned
name
i
was
thought
to
be
drowned
deemed
it
best
before
revealing
my
existence
to
the
world
to
try
and
restore
me
to
sanity
by
private
measures
rather
than
bring
upon
my
malady
the
eyes
of
a
mocking
world
in
doing
this
he
used
all
delicacy
all
devotion
surrounding
me
with
comforts
and
many
luxuries
and
even
humoring
my
insane
whim
to
have
the
companionship
of
a
child
found
with
me
on
the
raft
under
circumstances
suspicious
if
no
more
wretch
i
gasped
dare
only
asperse
me
in
thought
and
the
menace
hung
suspended
on
my
tongue
what
power
had
i
to
execute
it
even
if
uttered
as
to
my
name
i
feigned
none
it
was
my
mother
is
my
own
and
from
her
i
inherited
or
from
the
race
of
which
she
sprang
the
power
to
remember
and
avenge
my
wrongs
to
hate
and
curse
and
blast
perhaps
as
well
such
as
you
and
yours
granted
to
his
chosen
children
through
the
power
of
almighty
god
and
again
i
rose
and
confronted
him
then
fiercely
pointed
down
upon
his
ignoble
head
now
bowed
involuntarily
either
from
policy
or
nervous
terror
i
never
knew
a
finger
quivering
and
keen
with
scorn
and
rage
an
index
of
the
mind
that
directed
it
i
wonder
you
are
not
afraid
to
behave
to
me
in
this
manner
he
said
at
length
lifting
his
head
with
a
spasmodic
jerk
and
raising
to
mine
his
mottled
angry
eyes
now
cold
and
hard
as
pebbles
seeing
that
you
are
so
to
speak
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
he
extended
his
long
spongy
right
hand
and
closed
it
crushingly
as
though
it
contained
a
worm
while
he
smiled
and
sneered
oh
such
a
sneer
it
seemed
to
fill
the
room
true
true
i
am
very
helpless
i
said
sitting
down
with
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
and
clasping
my
hands
above
my
eyes
i
wept
aloud
adding
a
moment
later
as
i
indignantly
wiped
my
tears
yes
if
the
worst
betide
there
will
only
be
one
more
martyr
and
what
is
martyrdom
that
any
need
shrink
from
it
the
world
is
fall
of
it
nothing
if
you
are
used
to
it
he
said
carelessly
as
the
old
woman
remarked
of
the
eels
she
was
skinning
alive
i
suppose
you
know
all
about
it
by
this
time
but
come
you
are
rational
again
now
and
i
do
wish
to
be
hard
on
you
miriam
i
do
upon
my
soul
your
soul
i
murmured
your
soul
i
reiterated
louder
and
i
smiled
at
the
idea
that
suggested
itself
have
reptiles
souls
the
memory
of
your
father
alone
my
old
confiding
friend
one
of
the
most
perfect
of
men
as
i
always
thought
him
would
incline
me
kindly
to
his
daughter
even
if
no
other
tie
existed
between
us
he
said
calmly
unmindful
of
my
sarcasm
but
other
ties
do
exist
mistaken
girl
the
world
looks
upon
us
as
one
family
since
the
marriage
of
claude
and
evelyn
that
uncongenial
union
which
but
for
your
caprice
would
never
have
taken
place
and
which
is
at
the
root
of
all
our
misfortunes
all
our
fatal
necessities
necessities
i
muttered
between
my
clinched
teeth
drumming
with
my
fingers
impatiently
on
the
table
before
me
and
smiling
scornfully
a
moment
later
you
seem
in
a
mood
for
iteration
miss
monfort
i
make
my
running
commentaries
in
that
way
bainrothe
but
a
truce
to
recrimination
and
reminiscence
both
let
us
adhere
strictly
to
the
letter
and
verse
of
our
affairs
these
papers
form
the
subject
of
your
visit
i
believe
know
at
once
that
the
first
i
will
sign
on
certain
conditions
bitter
and
humiliating
as
i
feel
it
to
be
obliged
to
do
this
but
that
i
will
ever
consent
to
yield
the
guardianship
of
my
sister
wholly
to
evelyn
erle
and
her
husband
or
divest
myself
of
my
house
and
furniture
or
my
wild
lands
in
georgia
to
you
here
first
named
to
me
in
consideration
of
expenses
already
incurred
and
to
be
incurred
for
mabel
education
and
my
own
during
a
long
attack
of
lunacy
or
that
i
will
to
crown
the
whole
iniquitous
requisition
consent
to
give
my
hand
in
marriage
to
that
scoundrel
luke
gregory
are
visions
as
vain
as
those
of
the
child
who
tried
to
grasp
a
comet
or
the
moon
or
to
descend
in
comparison
to
catch
a
bird
by
putting
salt
on
its
tail
there
you
have
my
ultimatum
now
go
and
make
the
best
of
it
i
am
prepared
for
your
objections
prepared
too
to
overcome
them
he
said
coolly
take
time
to
consider
all
this
i
do
not
expect
an
answer
did
not
when
i
came
nor
will
i
accept
one
signature
without
the
whole
there
is
no
compromise
possible
as
to
your
marriage
it
must
be
accomplished
before
you
leave
this
room
i
as
a
magistrate
can
tie
the
knot
fast
enough
to
bind
all
the
other
agreements
to
certain
fulfillments
for
gregory
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
a
man
of
honor
and
will
see
them
carried
out
to
the
letter
he
loves
you
too
and
proves
it
for
he
takes
you
penniless
afterward
a
priest
may
complete
the
ceremony
if
you
have
any
scruples
then
of
course
it
rests
between
you
and
gregory
whether
you
remain
together
or
separate
as
wide
as
the
poles
i
shall
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
affair
thereafter
having
secured
my
good
name
and
yours
i
stood
with
bowed
head
and
moving
lips
before
him
mutely
indignantly
i
shall
however
make
all
this
he
continued
appear
as
well
as
possible
to
your
friends
and
mine
especially
believe
me
miriam
i
shall
state
for
your
sake
that
after
being
rescued
from
the
raft
you
were
partially
insane
but
still
sufficiently
mistress
of
yourself
to
coincide
with
me
and
your
sisters
in
the
wish
to
let
your
death
as
miss
harz
pass
current
with
the
world
until
you
should
redeem
your
errors
what
errors
and
be
restored
to
health
and
perfect
reason
you
will
see
that
your
acknowledgment
of
the
last
paper
includes
these
extenuating
facts
when
you
have
leisure
to
it
for
i
saw
how
hastily
you
glanced
over
that
one
in
particular
you
must
do
me
the
favor
to
peruse
it
much
more
carefully
drawing
on
his
gloves
coolly
before
you
make
your
final
decision
you
are
very
comfortable
here
my
dear
girl
glancing
around
benignly
but
you
have
no
conception
of
the
frame
of
mind
bare
walls
utter
solitude
a
tireless
hearth
and
a
frugal
table
would
bring
about
in
a
very
few
days
or
weeks
or
even
in
one
as
resolute
and
defiant
as
yourself
i
should
be
loath
to
try
such
an
experiment
deprive
you
of
your
but
non
habet
the
says
i
think
you
too
studied
a
little
latin
miriam
monster
not
a
very
relevant
or
polite
remark
i
must
confess
miriam
as
you
stand
before
me
with
your
figure
your
blazing
eyes
your
quivering
nostrils
your
curling
compressed
lip
your
heaving
chest
always
a
splendid
feature
in
your
your
folded
arms
and
the
color
coming
and
going
in
your
cheek
in
the
old
way
i
used
to
admire
so
much
in
your
girlhood
you
are
a
splendid
creature
by
jove
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
love
you
still
there
it
is
out
at
last
if
it
were
not
for
raymond
glancing
as
he
spoke
in
the
direction
of
clayton
with
a
knowing
smile
it
was
your
magnificent
disdain
that
kindled
the
torch
before
beware
how
you
revive
that
fanaticism
of
mine
i
turned
for
one
moment
with
an
involuntary
feeling
of
appeal
to
clayton
but
her
cold
green
eyes
were
quivering
in
accordance
with
the
smile
that
stretched
her
thin
lips
to
a
line
of
mocking
mirth
one
glimpse
of
sympathy
would
have
carried
me
to
her
arms
for
refuge
distasteful
as
she
was
to
me
in
every
way
save
one
she
like
myself
was
a
woman
but
such
perversion
of
all
natural
feeling
estranged
me
from
her
irreconcilably
and
forever
i
was
alone
shame
humiliation
despair
possessed
me
indignation
for
the
insult
i
was
forced
to
bear
in
her
presence
filled
my
soul
i
stood
with
my
head
cast
down
tears
raining
on
my
bosom
my
arms
dropped
nervelessly
beside
me
my
hands
clinched
my
whole
frame
trembling
with
excitement
slowly
and
one
by
one
came
those
convulsive
sobs
that
rend
and
wrench
the
physical
frame
as
earthquakes
do
the
earth
then
rose
the
sudden
resolve
born
of
volcanic
impulse
irresistible
to
mind
as
is
the
to
matter
sweeping
before
it
all
obstructions
of
reason
habit
expediency
if
it
cost
me
my
life
i
would
avenge
myself
on
this
tiger
thirsting
for
my
blood
i
would
anticipate
him
in
his
work
of
destruction
and
the
strength
of
samson
seemed
to
permeate
my
frame
it
was
strange
that
at
that
moment
of
cold
impetuous
energy
i
forgot
the
steel
i
carried
in
my
bosom
and
thought
only
of
the
power
i
bore
in
my
own
hands
i
determined
to
strangle
him
with
my
strong
elastic
fingers
of
which
i
knew
full
well
the
powerful
grasp
the
consequences
were
as
cobwebs
in
my
estimate
compared
to
the
ecstasy
of
such
revenge
for
all
this
flashed
through
my
brain
with
the
swift
vividness
of
lightning
and
in
less
than
thirty
seconds
after
his
last
remark
this
matter
was
matured
the
woman
prevailed
over
the
lady
i
raised
my
eyes
slowly
and
dashed
away
my
tears
preparatory
to
the
onset
he
was
looking
at
me
and
perhaps
with
something
like
compunction
in
his
face
as
i
met
his
gaze
he
must
have
read
an
expression
that
appalled
him
in
those
dilated
eyes
of
mine
that
confronted
his
for
as
i
sprang
toward
him
he
bounded
backward
and
escaped
through
the
door
of
clayton
chamber
which
he
shot
after
him
with
undignified
alertness
i
stood
smiling
and
strangely
cold
leaning
against
the
while
my
heart
beat
as
though
it
would
have
leaped
from
my
throat
and
i
could
feel
the
pallor
of
my
face
as
chill
as
marble
clayton
approached
me
but
i
put
her
away
with
waving
hands
go
wretch
i
said
woman
no
more
you
have
unsexed
yourself
leave
me
in
peace
your
touch
is
poisonous
she
shrank
away
silently
and
i
stood
for
a
while
like
one
frozen
then
cast
myself
down
on
a
chair
and
gave
way
to
bitter
weeping
the
were
open
and
the
waters
had
indeed
come
in
over
my
soul
i
had
restrained
my
passionate
inclinations
until
now
not
only
from
a
sense
of
personal
dignity
but
from
a
determination
not
to
play
into
the
hands
of
my
enemies
and
captors
and
all
the
more
from
such
long
was
the
revulsion
potent
and
overwhelming
the
consciousness
that
ernie
was
at
my
knee
at
last
aroused
me
from
the
indulgence
of
my
grief
and
i
looked
down
to
meet
his
corn
passionate
and
inquiring
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
a
masterful
expression
i
have
never
seen
in
any
other
childish
face
it
thrilled
me
to
the
heart
what
mirry
cry
for
is
god
mad
with
mirry
he
asked
at
length
it
seems
so
ernie
yet
oh
no
no
i
can
not
will
not
believe
in
such
injustice
on
the
part
of
the
most
high
i
pursued
in
sad
soliloquy
with
folded
hands
and
shaking
head
and
musing
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
before
me
my
god
will
not
forsake
me
did
the
bad
man
hurt
mirry
he
asked
leaning
with
both
arms
on
my
lap
and
putting
up
his
hand
to
touch
my
face
yes
very
cruelly
ernie
big
giant
will
come
and
kill
him
and
fayways
put
him
in
the
river
and
the
old
wolf
wat
eat
red
riding
hood
eat
him
and
then
the
devil
will
roast
him
for
his
dinner
i
could
but
smile
albeit
through
my
tears
at
the
climax
of
these
threats
which
seemed
to
delight
and
stir
the
inmost
soul
of
ernie
his
eyes
flashed
his
cheek
crimsoned
his
wide
red
mouth
curled
with
disdainful
ire
disclosing
the
small
pointed
pearls
within
he
seemed
transfigured
and
ernie
what
will
ernie
do
for
mirry
i
asked
as
i
watched
the
workings
of
his
expressive
face
will
ernie
let
the
wicked
man
kill
mirry
he
looked
at
his
small
hands
and
arms
then
extended
them
wistfully
ernie
will
tell
good
jesus
he
said
and
he
will
make
ernie
grow
big
ever
so
big
to
tie
the
man
and
put
him
in
a
bag
like
cat
the
burlesque
was
irresistible
and
none
the
less
so
that
the
child
was
so
direfully
in
earnest
to
his
infant
imagination
no
worse
disaster
than
had
befallen
clayton
cat
could
be
devised
this
animal
adored
by
him
had
been
bagged
and
exiled
perhaps
drowned
for
aught
i
know
for
stealing
cheese
from
the
cupboard
sacred
to
clayton
by
that
vengeful
potentate
to
the
despair
of
ernie
the
idolized
kittens
too
which
had
followed
her
had
disappeared
with
their
mother
and
days
of
infant
melancholy
ensued
during
which
the
canaries
before
referred
to
were
brought
as
substitutes
the
faithful
heart
still
clung
to
its
feline
passion
it
was
evident
though
for
weeks
the
memory
of
that
hapless
cat
had
been
ignored
and
its
name
unmentioned
i
believe
after
my
momentary
wrath
was
over
i
should
have
been
content
with
the
punishment
suggested
by
the
child
as
sufficient
even
for
basil

the
raft
on
which
miss
lamarque
and
her
family
had
found
refuge
had
been
swept
by
the
tempest
of
nearly
every
soul
that
clung
to
it
after
a
terrible
night
of
storm
and
rain
during
which
that
courageous
lady
that
sybarite
of
society
sustained
the
fainting
souls
of
her
companions
by
singing
the
grand
anthems
of
her
church
in
a
voice
loud
clear
and
sweet
as
that
of
a
dying
swan
one
child
was
saved
of
the
nine
little
ones
and
the
brother
and
sister
remained
almost
alone
on
the
raft
let
it
be
here
mentioned
that
at
no
period
of
her
subsequent
life
a
long
and
apparently
prosperous
one
could
miss

bear
to
hear
the
circumstances
of
the
wreck
alluded
to
dunmore
and
his
companions
found
a
watery
grave
chapter
ix
a
nervous
headache
that
confined
me
to
my
bed
for
several
days
succeeded
the
degrading
and
exciting
scene
through
which
i
had
passed
and
as
clayton
had
at
the
same
time
one
of
her
prostrating
neuralgic
attacks
the
services
of
dinah
were
in
active
requisition
during
my
own
peculiar
phase
of
suffering
the
small
racket
of
ernie
unnoticed
in
hours
of
health
grated
painfully
on
my
ear
and
i
caught
eagerly
at
the
proposition
of
the
negress
to
take
him
for
a
walk
and
hours
of
play
in
the
sunshine
privileges
he
did
not
very
often
obtain
in
these
latter
days
i
was
much
the
better
for
having
lain
silently
for
a
time
when
he
returned
with
his
hands
filled
with
flowers
his
lips
smelling
of
and
his
eyes
always
his
finest
feature
dancing
with
delight
he
had
seen
ady
he
told
me
with
eagerness
and
she
had
kissed
him
and
tied
a
string
of
beads
about
his
neck
red
ones
which
he
displayed
and
ady
had
a
comb
in
her
head
and
her
toof
was
broke
touching
one
of
his
own
front
teeth
lightly
so
that
i
knew
he
was
not
pointing
out
any
deficiency
in
the
comb
from
this
description
vague
as
it
was
i
identified
ada
greene
as
the
person
intended
to
be
described
for
i
too
had
observed
the
imperfection
he
made
a
point
of
a
broken
tooth
impairing
the
beauty
of
otherwise
faultless
ones
and
who
gave
you
the
flowers
ernie
i
asked
receiving
them
from
his
generous
hands
as
i
spoke
and
raising
the
white
roses
to
my
nostrils
to
inhale
their
delicate
breath
did
ady
give
you
these
no
angy
he
answered
solemnly
tell
me
about
angy
ernie
had
she
wings
no
wings
poor
angy
could
not
fly
she
was
walking
in
the
garden
with
adam
and
eve
with
their
clothes
on
he
said
earnestly
and
claude
bainrothe
no
doubt
i
thought
smiling
at
the
strange
mixture
of
the
real
and
the
ideal
the
plates
of
the
old
bible
evidently
supplied
the
latter
from
which
many
of
his
impressions
were
derived
and
the
practical
pair
in
question
the
former
quietly
perambulating
together
but
angy
could
i
doubt
for
one
moment
to
whom
he
applied
that
celestial
title
the
face
of
one
of
the
angels
in
the
transfiguration
did
indeed
resemble
mabel
i
had
often
remarked
and
pondered
over
it
tell
me
about
angy
ernie
i
entreated
o
heaven
to
think
her
hands
have
touched
these
flowers
her
sweet
face
bent
above
him
darling
darling
to
be
divided
and
yet
so
near
it
breaks
my
heart
and
tears
flowed
freely
while
he
tried
to
describe
the
vision
that
had
so
impressed
him
in
his
earnest
way
poor
angy
got
no
wings
he
began
again
bu
hair
and
bu
eyes
and
bu
dress
every
thing
he
admired
was
blue
and
she
kissed
ernie
and
gave
him
then
adam
and
eve
laughed
just
so
grinning
wonderfully
and
said
home
bad
ugly
child
with
a
back
on
then
angy
pulled
flowers
and
gave
ernie
it
is
only
the
little
gal
next
door
i
means
de
young
lady
ob
de
wut

poor
foolish
baby

about

so
but
what
is
the
name
of
the
pretty
little
girl
of
whom
you
speak
tell
me
if
you
know
and
i
laid
my
hand
upon
her
arm
and
whispered
this
inquiry
waiting
impatiently
for
a
confirmation
of
my
almost
certainty
for
that
my
darling
ernie
angy
i
could
not
doubt
and
the
thought
moved
me
to
tremulous
emotion
dar
now
you
is
going
to
hab

ob
dem
bad
turns

follered

to

so
dere
is
only
miss
polly
ann
lef
and
here
clayton
groaned
audibly
and
calling
dinah
to
her
aid
broke
up
the
if
such
might
justly
have
been
called
our
interview
it
was
not
very
long
however
before
dinah
returned
to
my
bedside
by
clayton
directions
to
offer
to
comb
out
my
hair
which
was
tangled
beyond
my
skill
to
thread
in
my
prostrate
condition
yet
to
make
an
effort
so
far
as
to
rise
and
have
this
done
i
knew
would
be
of
benefit
to
me
we
were
sitting
by
the
toilet
while
the
process
of
untangling
my
massive
length
of
locks
was
going
on
and
the
upper
drawer
thereof
was
half
open
thus
affording
me
a
glimpse
of
its
contents
among
these
was
my
silent
watch
with
its
chain
of
gold
its
pencil
and
seal
attached
i
wore
it
usually
though
useless
now
in
its
silent
condition
the
mainspring
was
broken
from
habit
and
for
safe
keeping
but
had
laid
it
there
when
i
staggered
to
my
bed
ill
and
weak
after
my
terrible
interview
with
bainrothe
it
caught
the
eye
of
dinah
and
stirred
her
avarice
and
she
began
to
question
me
i
soon
saw
with
a
view
of
getting
it
in
her
own
possession
the
selfishness
of
the
old
negress
had
struck
me
on
the
raft
as
something
rare
even
in
one
of
her
shallow
race
and
my
conviction
of
her
cowardice
and
coldness
prevented
me
from
taking
advantage
of
her
cupidity
as
i
might
have
done
otherwise
she
was
fully
capable
i
felt
convinced
of
accepting
my
watch
as
a
bribe
and
failing
afterward
to
come
up
to
her
bargain
yet
dear
as
it
was
to
me
from
association
of
ideas
i
should
not
have
weighed
it
an
instant
against
the
merest
probability
of
escape
i
knew
if
i
could
gain
an
hour
upon
my
pursuers
i
should
be
safe
in
the
house
of
pemberton
or
even
in
that
of
craig
another
friend
of
my
father
i
was
comparatively
at
home
anywhere
in
the
city
of
my
nativity
acquainted
as
i
was
with
its
streets
and
people
and
i
fully
determined
when
i
found
sabra
avarice
excited
to
offer
her
as
a
reward
this
golden
treasure
should
she
first
place
me
in
circumstances
to
gain
my
freedom
dey
calls
you
pore
honey
she
said
softly
but
wen
i
sees
dat
bright
gole
watch
and
chain
i
knows
better
now
i
reckon
dey
would
bring
enough
bright
silver
dollars
at
a
juglar
shop
ty
buy
my
ole
man
twice
over
agin
he
is
but
porely
and
our
chilluns
is
all
dead
and
gone
anyway
all
but
one
way
down
in
new
orleans
an
ef
i
could
git
his
free
papers
he
might
come
here
and
jine
his
wife
in
freedom
even
if
massa
jack
dillard
did
heir
masta
estate
how
much
would
dat
watch
and
chain
be
worth
honey
two
or
three
hundred
dollars
i
suppose
i
do
know
exactly
but
certainly
enough
to
buy
your
old
man
at
southerners
value
set
upon
aged
negroes
but
whether
it
be
or
not
an
apparition
of
which
i
fortunately
caught
the
reflection
in
the
glass
before
me
cut
short
the
promise
that
hovered
on
my
lips
it
was
that
of
clayton
in
her
and
swathed
in
flannel
peering
peeping
listening
at
the
door
of
her
chamber
as
unlovely
a
vision
certainly
as
ever
broke
up
an
or
dissolved
a
delusion
i
maintained
my
though
my
agitation
was
extreme
the
crisis
had
seemed
so
favorable
while
she
limped
forward
and
accosted
me
civilly
with
a
demand
as
peremptory
as
a
highwayman
for
my
watch
and
chain
of
which
i
took
no
notice
i
should
be
doing
you
great
injustice
in
your
condition
she
added
coolly
to
let
you
sell
your
watch
even
to
benefit
dinah
and
her
old
man
benevolent
as
is
your
motive
so
i
must
take
possession
of
it
or
send
for
englehart
to
do
so
whichever
you
prefer
the
watch
is
there
i
said
rising
haughtily
with
my
still
unadjusted
hair
falling
about
me
it
was
my
father
and
is
precious
to
me
far
beyond
its
intrinsic
value
and
i
shall
hold
you
accountable
for
it
some
day
take
it
at
once
though
rather
than
recall
the
person
before
me
with
whose
presence
you
menace
me
keep
it
yourself
however
i
would
rather
deal
with
you
than
the
others
false
as
you
have
shown
yourself
to
every
promise
i
wish
you
would
be
reasonable
she
said
and
do
what
your
friends
ask
of
you
this
confinement
is
wearing
us
both
out
it
will
be
the
death
of
me
and
you
will
be
to
blame
the
sooner
the
better
i
rejoined
heartlessly
ah
miss
monfort
you
have
no
better
friend
than
i
am
perhaps
but
you
are
ungrateful
i
hope
not
but
some
things
of
late
have
shaken
i
confess
what
little
faith
i
had
in
you
this
confiscation
of
my
property
is
one
of
them
you
know
why
this
is
done
i
need
not
explain
but
i
shall
trust
you
fearlessly
in
dinah
society
in
future
i
believe
you
have
no
other
treasure
to
bribe
her
with
and
smiling
in
her
sardonic
way
she
turned
and
limped
to
her
bedroom
which
it
had
cost
her
so
great
an
effort
to
leave
her
groans
and
moans
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
were
piteous
and
dinah
could
do
nothing
to
comfort
her
a
sudden
determination
possessed
me
my
own
system
recuperated
rapidly
and
after
a
nervous
headache
i
was
always
conscious
of
renewed
vital
power
and
of
keener
sensations
i
would
try
the
experiment
once
more
hazarded
under
circumstances
so
different
that
it
made
me
tremulous
but
to
think
of
the
vast
abyss
between
my
and
then
and
essay
to
magnetize
clayton
she
could
not
sleep
naturally
and
she
feared
evidently
to
avail
herself
of
opiates
lest
in
her
heavy
slumber
perhaps
i
should
escape
in
her
normal
condition
this
seemed
impossible
for
she
slept
habitually
as
lightly
as
a
cat
or
bird
upon
its
perch
yet
lying
and
with
her
key
beneath
her
head
never
dreaming
of
other
outlet
she
felt
at
ease
i
had
already
learned
that
since
her
illness
there
were
additional
precautions
taken
to
insure
my
safety
and
as
she
had
alleged
her
own
fidelity
the
dragon
was
watched
in
turn
by
a
cerberus
no
other
than
the
colored
coachman
of
basil
bainrothe
of
whom
mention
has
been
made
far
back
in
these
pages
thus
secure
and
secured
clayton
might
have
surrendered
herself
to
slumber
with
all
serenity
one
would
suppose
had
it
not
absolutely
refused
to
visit
her
eyelids
and
the
suggestion
of
an
opiate
on
my
part
was
received
for
some
reason
in
dumb
derision
i
went
to
her
at
last
and
said
clayton
i
hear
you
groaning
grievously
and
i
fancy
i
could
relieve
you
the
laying
on
of
hands
is
a
sort
of
gift
of
mine
let
me
try
by
such
means
to
ease
your
pain
thank
you
miss
monfort
very
dryly
you
are
very
kind
indeed
but
i
do
think
you
can
relieve
me
i
have
excruciating
neuralgia
in
my
eyebones
and
temples
and
my
hands
are
cramped
again
dinah
has
been
rubbing
without
bettering
them
for
the
last
half
hour
let
me
try
and
without
farther
parley
i
sat
down
to
my
loathed
and
detested
task
first
quietly
dismissing
dinah
to
the
next
room
where
ernie
was
eating
his
supper
and
i
knew
would
soon
be
wanting
to
be
put
to
bed
we
changed
places
for
a
time
and
it
was
not
long
before
clayton
pronounced
the
pain
in
her
eyes
almost
gone
the
experiment
was
a
desperate
one
and
i
bore
to
it
all
the
powers
of
my
organization
mental
and
physical
and
had
the
satisfaction
in
less
than
an
hour
to
see
her
sleeping
profoundly
she
had
been
failing
fast
under
her
painful
vigils
and
i
knew
that
a
few
hours
of
refreshing
sleep
would
be
worth
to
her
more
than
all
the
drugs
in
the
pharmacopoeia
now
came
the
test
which
was
to
make
this
slumber
worth
nothing
or
every
thing
to
me
if
she
could
be
awakened
from
it
without
my
coincidence
it
would
prove
perhaps
only
a
snare
to
my
feet
but
if
her
waking
depended
on
my
will
then
might
i
indeed
hope
to
baffle
my
dragon
and
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
make
sure
of
my
escape
i
willed
then
earnestly
that
she
should
sleep
until
twelve
and
at
ten
when
dinah
became
impatient
to
retire
i
gave
her
permission
in
order
to
gain
egress
to
try
and
arouse
clayton
in
consequence
of
this
immurement
of
our
servant
i
had
remained
supperless
beyond
the
crusts
of
bread
left
by
ernie
and
some
cold
tea
in
clayton
teapot
of
which
i
partook
with
an
appetite
born
of
exhaustion
those
who
have
undertaken
this
laying
on
of
hands
for
the
purpose
of
soothing
pain
will
comprehend
what
the
succeeding
sensation
of
nerveless
prostration
is
those
only
and
give
me
their
sympathy
from
her
errand
to
arouse
our
sleeper
in
quest
of
the
key
of
course
dinah
returned
disconsolate
greatly
to
my
satisfaction
she
stated
that
it
was
out
ob
de
question
to
try
to
git
her
eyes
open
why
honey
she
pursued
ef
i
did
know
what
a
christian
creetur
she
was
i
mout
suppose
she
had
bin
of
whisky
or
de
sleepiest
stuff
goin
chile
but
i
does
believe
she
has
the
fits
caze
even
wen
i
pulled
open
one
corner
of
her
eyes
dey
was
rolled
clean
back
in
her
head
mebbe
she
dyin
chile
an
ef
she
is
but
no
she
muttered
dat
ole
creetur
nebber
leaves
dem
opun
one
minute
you
had
better
believe
even
ef
he
happens
to
turn
his
back
a
spell
an
it
would
be
no
use
tryin
to
git
out
ob
de
dat
way
but
i
knows
whar
she
keeps
her
key
i
kin
go
to
bed
myself
if
you
say
so
an
you
kin
lock
de
do
inside
an
lay
de
key
back
undernefe
her
pillow
you
see
dar
a
bolt
outside
too
honey
an
i
means
to
draw
dat
after
me
as
ole
caleb
always
does
ob
nights
wen
he
goes
to
bed
chuckling
low
at
the
manifest
disappointment
in
my
face
she
disappeared
to
return
almost
instantly
i
thought
she
must
be
possumin
she
said
but
i
know
she
is
as
asleep
now
as
de
bar
in
de
hollow
ob
a
tree
in
cole
wedder
for
she
made
no
like
wen
i
grabbed
de
key
from
undernefe
her
head
here
it
is
chile
an
ef
you
wants
to
try
your
you
kin
but
i
spec
you
better
wait
a
spell
and
she
looked
cunningly
at
me
dere
traps
everywhar
in
dese
woods
it
occurred
to
me
as
well
that
clayton
might
be
feigning
slumber
having
penetrated
my
design
of
lulling
and
soothing
her
fitful
spirit
to
rest
and
feeling
as
i
did
an
utter
want
of
confidence
in
sabra
not
only
as
free
agent
but
as
watched
attendant
i
determined
as
far
as
in
me
lay
to
disarm
suspicion
by
duplicity
so
i
lifted
up
my
voice
in
testimony
of
deceit
and
declared
my
weariness
of
bondage
to
be
such
that
i
had
determined
to
embrace
bainrothe
conditions
and
that
in
a
few
days
i
should
be
free
again
without
assistance
so
take
the
key
dinah
i
said
after
observing
it
closely
and
perceiving
that
it
was
several
sizes
larger
than
that
i
had
made
as
clumsy
as
that
was
and
therefore
could
be
of
no
use
to
me
let
yourself
out
and
bolt
the
door
behind
you
and
clayton
shall
see
that
i
will
take
no
mean
advantage
of
her
slumbers
this
arrangement
having
been
carried
with
speedy
effect
i
returned
to
my
own
chamber
after
a
close
scrutiny
of
clayton
condition
and
employed
myself
at
once
in
running
my
penknife
around
the
door
concealed
by
my
and
thus
loosening
the
paper
pasted
on
cotton
cloth
that
covered
it
from
that
of
the
wall
with
which
it
was
connected
so
intimately
as
to
make
the
whole
surface
within
the
chamber
seem
to
form
one
partition
long
before
this
i
had
cut
that
which
surrounded
the
lock
so
that
it
lay
like
a
flap
over
it
fastened
down
lightly
however
with
part
of
ernie
draught
for
a
catarrh
so
as
to
baffle
slight
inspection
my
heart
beat
wildly
as
after
having
effected
this
preliminary
step
i
cautiously
unlocked
the
door
which
for
aught
i
knew
might
be
like
that
of
clayton
closet
bolted
without
so
as
to
frustrate
all
my
efforts
it
opened
outwardly
and
could
have
been
readily
so
secured
in
the
great
providence
of
god
it
was
not
bolted
i
sank
on
my
knees
weak
and
prayerful
i
remember
as
the
door
swung
slightly
back
revealing
the
platform
beyond
and
the
short
stair
that
led
from
it
up
to
the
second
story
the
hinges
creaked
a
little
and
these
i
hastened
to
oil
then
closing
and
relocking
the
door
softly
i
crept
without
pushing
my
bedstead
back
again
the
few
inches
i
had
wheeled
it
forward
to
look
once
more
upon
the
sleeping
face
of
clayton
it
was
still
calm
and
unconscious
ernie
too
slumbered
peacefully
every
thing
seemed
propitious
to
my
purpose
i
threw
on
hastily
the
famous
flimsy
black
silk
and
mantle
that
had
been
prepared
for
me
on
shipboard
tied
a
dark
veil
over
my
head
and
with
no
other
precaution
went
forth
as
i
hoped
to
freedom
my
heart
seemed
to
suspend
its
action
as
cautiously
unlocking
and
opening
the
door
i
stepped
forth
on
the
platform
it
will
be
remembered
that
i
knew
the
topography
of
the
lower
part
of
the
house
of
old
thoroughly
i
had
been
entertained
there
with
my
father
more
than
once
when
as
heiress
of
my
mother
great
estate
i
had
commanded
the
reverence
of
my
hosts
and
the
situation
of
parlors
study
and
was
perfectly
familiar
to
me
it
was
what
in
those
days
was
called
a
single
house
though
a
mansion
that
is
all
the
rooms
with
one
exception
were
placed
either
on
the
same
side
of
the
wide
hall
of
entrance
or
behind
it
in
the
ell
the
study
alone
formed
a
small
lateral
projection
on
the
other
hand
the
door
of
this
apartment
opened
at
the
foot
of
that
stair
on
the
tipper
platform
of
which
i
now
stood
trembling
weighing
my
fate
by
a
hair
i
had
left
the
door
ajar
through
which
i
had
crept
quietly
so
that
in
case
of
failure
i
might
have
a
chance
of
retreat
before
discovery
should
be
made
it
was
well
perhaps
that
i
did
so
on
this
occasion
for
otherwise
i
should
scarcely
have
had
nerve
enough
to
avoid
the
sure
and
speedy
detection
which
must
have
followed
the
slightest
delay
or
noise
made
in
returning
i
lingered
to
reconnoitre
some
minutes
on
the
platform
before
i
ventured
to
commence
the
wary
descent
of
the
broad
carpeted
stairway
i
had
convinced
myself
that
the
second
story
was
empty
though
a
lighted
lamp
swung
in
the
upper
entry
as
well
as
in
that
below
throwing
a
flood
of
radiance
on
the
scene
with
which
i
would
fain
have
dispensed
i
heard
the
sound
of
voices
from
the
closed
parlors
and
saw
reposing
on
the
rack
before
me
several
hats
and
canes
indicative
of
visitors
from
the
study
however
there
fortunately
came
no
murmur
and
i
found
that
it
was
dark
the
stood
invitingly
open
i
could
see
the
opposite
without
and
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
dart
on
and
downward
and
reach
at
a
bound
the
pavement
when
the
door
of
the
first
parlor
was
suddenly
thrown
back
and
left
so
by
a
servant
coming
out
with
a
tray
of
wines
and
fruits
which
he
had
been
evidently
handing
and
i
had
just
time
to
shrink
into
shadow
favored
in
my
wish
for
concealment
by
the
black
dress
and
veil
i
wore
when
a
once
familiar
form
appeared
in
the
of
the
front
hall
which
i
recognized
at
a
glance
as
that
of
gregory
closing
the
door
firmly
after
him
he
prepared
to
divest
himself
of
hat
and
cape
in
the
hall
without
a
look
in
my
direction
after
the
completion
of
which
process
he
entered
the
parlor
by
the
nearest
door
setting
that
also
wide
open
as
he
did
so
with
some
exclamation
about
the
heat
of
the
apartment
which
seemed
to
meet
with
acquiescence
from
the
powers
within
i
caught
a
panoramic
view
of
that
interior
before
i
fled
swiftly
noiselessly
hopelessly
back
to
my
cage
again
having
lost
my
only
chance
of
escape
by
that
fatal
delay
of
five
minutes
on
the
platform
i
should
have
been
out
and
away
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
ere
gregory
entered
the
inclosure
before
the
house
had
i
not
hesitated
yet
after
all
perhaps
i
miscalculated
what
if
i
had
met
him
face
to
face
been
seized
and
dragged
back
again
to
captivity
perchance
it
was
better
as
it
was
time
would
develop
and
determine
this
but
in
the
interval
how
woeful
was
my
disappointment
i
had
time
to
get
to
bed
again
and
in
some
degree
recover
my
composure
indeed
i
had
been
in
bed
an
hour
when
the
clock
in
the
beneath
me
which
since
the
evident
occupancy
of
that
hall
had
been
wound
and
put
in
running
order
struck
twelve
with
its
melodramatic
tones
and
at
the
very
moment
i
heard
sounds
indicative
of
the
resurrection
of
the
mesmeric
sleeper
she
was
evidently
startled
in
some
way
on
finding
herself
awake
again
or
perhaps
from
having
fallen
so
soundly
asleep
in
hands
like
mine
for
she
called
aloud
first
for
dinah
then
repeatedly
on
miriam
both
without
effect
in
a
few
moments
after
these
appeals
had
died
away
she
came
in
person
as
i
knew
she
would
to
reconnoitre
the
bedstead
had
been
pushed
carefully
and
noiselessly
back
again
on
its
grooved
castors
against
the
door
from
the
lock
of
which
the
wooden
key
had
been
removed
rewashed
in
oil
and
hidden
away
in
that
hollow
aperture
in
the
bedstead
which
formed
a
perfect
box
by
the
skillful
readjustment
of
one
loosened
compartment
of
the
veneering
of
the
massive
post
she
shook
me
slightly
and
i
rose
in
my
bed
with
a
start
and
shudder
admirably
simulated
i
fancied
and
which
completely
deceived
her
evidently
i
am
sorry
to
have
startled
you
so
she
said
hurriedly
but
where
is
dinah
miss
monfort
and
how
did
she
get
out
i
really
can
not
inform
you
where
she
is
i
answered
petulantly
i
scarcely
think
it
was
worth
while
to
disturb
me
for
the
sake
of
asking
me
a
question
you
must
have
known
my
inability
to
answer
but
how
did
she
get
out
miss
harz
by
means
of
the
key
under
your
head
which
you
will
find
in
the
lock
no
doubt
where
it
was
left
she
promised
me
insolently
enough
to
bolt
the
door
outside
to
prevent
egress
and
i
to
prevent
ingress
locked
it
within
so
she
assured
you
we
were
both
prisoners
by
night
did
she
well
i
am
glad
you
have
proof
at
last
of
what
i
told
you
i
have
no
proof
but
as
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
come
to
terms
of
some
kind
very
soon
i
thought
it
useless
to
investigate
do
you
feel
better
for
my
laying
on
of
hands
you
seem
refreshed
yes
greatly
better
a
good
sleep
was
what
i
needed
and
i
fell
into
a
doze
while
you
were
beside
the
bed
i
believe
i
have
heard
of
magnetism
before
as
a
means
of
relief
for
pain
now
i
am
convinced
of
its
efficacy
magnetism
you
do
think
it
amounts
to
that
do
you
you
flatter
me
and
i
laughed
i
do
indeed
and
i
am
sure
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
miss
monfort
though
for
that
matter
you
can
never
say
even
when
you
come
to
your
own
again
which
you
will
now
do
shortly
that
i
have
not
been
considerate
and
attentive
to
you
while
in
confinement
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
any
complaint
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
i
think
i
comprehend
you
and
your
motives
by
this
time
let
there
be
peace
between
us
from
this
hour
and
i
extended
my
hand
to
her
which
very
unexpectedly
to
me
she
seized
and
kissed
a
proceeding
deprecated
loathingly
i
assure
you
i
added
laughingly
i
would
rather
even
marry
englehart
than
continue
here
then
you
will
marry
mr
gregory
i
do
not
know
either
that
or
die
i
suppose
whichever
god
pleases
i
am
weary
of
being
a
prisoner
weary
of
you
of
every
thing
about
me
all
that
i
cared
for
is
lost
to
me
and
i
might
as
well
surrender
i
suppose
not
at
discretion
however
she
turned
from
me
silently
and
sought
her
couch
again
but
i
felt
instinctively
that
she
slept
no
more
and
so
we
lay
silently
watching
one
another
until
morning
i
dared
not
renew
my
efforts
to
escape
at
all
events
in
the
when
i
knew
the
house
was
locked
and
watched
without
as
well
as
within
for
this
was
the
old
habit
of
the
square
one
two
three
four
came
and
passed
and
were
reported
by
the
clock
in
the
room
beneath
me
before
i
slept
and
then
i
dreamed
a
vision
so
vivid
that
i
wakened
from
it
excited
exhausted
as
though
its
frightful
figments
had
been
stern
realities
i
thought
that
the
noble
dog
ossian
came
to
me
again
and
laid
the
key
upon
my
lap
as
he
had
done
at
beauseincourt
staining
my
white
dress
with
blood
not
mud
this
time
and
that
colonel
la
vigne
struck
it
furiously
to
the
floor
and
handed
me
instead
the
wooden
one
i
had
carved
with
the
words
of
the
proverb
the
opportunity
lost
is
like
the
arrow
sped
it
comes
no
more
your
wooden
key
will
fail
you
next
time
as
it
has
failed
you
this
and
you
will
be
baffled
baffled
as
you
tried
to
baffle
me
miriam
unseen
i
pursue
you
then
he
laughed
horribly
and
faded
in
the
gray
dawn
to
which
i
awoke
covered
with
cold
dew
and
trembling
in
every
limb
had
he
been
there
indeed
in
spiritual
presence
was
it
his
hand
that
had
left
that
hand
about
my
brow
that
surging
in
my
brain
that
weight
upon
my
heart
o
god
had
i
indeed
become
the
sport
of
fiends
at
last
i
wept
and
in
my
tears
found
sullen
comfort
the
image
so
often
caviled
at
as
false
in
came
to
me
then
as
the
readiest
interpretation
of
what
i
suffered
and
thus
proved
its
own
fidelity
and
truth
a
sea
of
sorrow
did
indeed
seem
to
roll
above
me
against
which
i
felt
the
vanity
of
taking
arms
my
destruction
was
decreed
and
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
suffer
and
submit
all
the
persecution
i
had
sustained
since
my
father
death
at
the
hands
of
evelyn
and
basil
bainrothe
all
my
wrongs
beginning
at
the
of
claude
and
ending
with
the
immurement
i
was
suffering
now
at
the
hands
of
his
father
all
my
strange
life
at
beauseincourt
with
its
episode
of
horror
its
one
reality
of
perfect
happiness
too
fair
to
last
its
singular
revelations
its
warm
and
deep
attachments
my
fearful
and
experience
on
the
burning
ship
the
level
raft
with
the
green
waves
curling
above
it
the
rescue
the
snare
into
which
i
had
inevitably
fallen
the
closing
around
me
all
were
there
in
one
vivid
and
overwhelming
mental
summary
i
think
if
ever
madness
came
near
me
in
my
life
it
came
that
night
so
crushing
so
terrific
was
this
weight
which
sysiphus
like
memory
was
rolling
to
the
summit
of
the
present
moment
to
fall
back
again
by
the
power
of
its
own
weight
to
the
valley
below
the
valley
of
despair
and
destroy
all
that
it
encountered
or
found
beneath
it
yet
by
the
time
the
sun
was
up
my
eyes
were
sealed
again
in
slumber
before
i
close
this
chapter
it
will
be
as
well
to
describe
the
tableau
i
had
caught
sight
of
through
the
open
parlor
door
when
i
tempted
my
fate
and
failed
standing
close
in
the
shadow
so
that
even
if
directed
toward
me
unconsciously
the
glance
of
those
within
i
knew
could
not
penetrate
the
mystery
of
my
presence
i
scanned
with
a
sad
derision
the
scene
before
me
with
a
glance
i
received
the
impression
that
it
required
moments
to
convey
in
narrative
on
the
with
his
back
to
the
fire
his
legs
apart
his
parted
behind
him
stood
basil
bainrothe
monarch
of
all
he
surveyed
with
extended
hand
evidently
demonstrating
some
axiom
to
the
two
visitors
ensconced
on
the
sofa
near
him
who
with
the
exception
of
their
booted
feet
and
the
straps
of
their
pantaloons
were
beyond
my
angle
of
vision
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
chimney
from
these
inscrutable
guests
sat
two
ladies
elaborately
dressed
and
rouged
in
whom
i
recognized
at
a
glance
evelyn
erie
and
raymond
just
before
i
vanished
claude
bainrothe
courteous
in
manner
and
elegant
in
exterior
approached
them
from
the
other
parlor
in
time
to
witness
the
of
gregory
to
which
i
have
referred
and
to
salute
him
cordially
that
these
were
all
confederated
i
could
not
doubt
and
prepared
to
aid
each
other
how
could
i
know
that
one
pair
of
those
evident
feet
belonged
to
the
invisible
body
of
a
man
who
was
one
of
the
few
whom
i
could
have
called
to
my
defense
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
had
choice
of
champions
been
afforded
me
it
was
not
until
long
afterward
that
i
ascertained
beyond
a
doubt
that
major
favraud
had
formed
one
of
that
company
on
the
occasion
of
my
fatal
failure
had
i
dreamed
of
his
presence
i
should
fearlessly
have
entered
the
parlor
and
thrown
myself
on
his
brotherly
protection
secure
of
his
best
efforts
to
rescue
me
even
though
his
own
heart
blood
had
been
the
sacrifice
alas
should
i
ever
find
another
dart
like
that
never
to
be
recalled
to
launch
in
the
right
direction
and
fix
quivering
in
the
eye
of
the
target
god
alone
could
know
chapter
x
after
the
one
hopeful
excitement
of
my
my
spirit
drooped
deplorably
for
a
season
and
all
occupation
became
distasteful
to
me
my
diary
even
was
abandoned
the
writing
of
which
had
so
well
assisted
to
fill
my
time
and
although
destroyed
daily
to
impress
upon
my
memory
a
faithful
and
sequent
record
of
the
monotonous
hours
else
remembered
merely
as
a
homogeneous
whole
had
it
not
been
for
poor
ernie
and
his
requirements
i
should
have
sunk
under
this
fresh
phase
of
suffering
i
am
convinced
my
health
too
was
giving
way
my
strength
my
energy
were
falling
i
kept
my
bed
as
i
had
never
been
willing
to
do
before
if
able
to
arise
from
it
until
noon
sometimes
for
want
of
nervous
impulse
and
my
food
was
tasteless
and
innutritious
even
when
i
forced
myself
to
eat
a
portion
of
what
was
placed
regularly
before
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
long
ere
this
wardour
wentworth
must
have
ascertained
my
fate
and
the
thought
that
he
might
be
passive
when
my
very
soul
was
at
stake
thrilled
me
with
agony
unspeakable
this
mood
endured
so
long
that
even
clayton
grew
alarmed
she
insisted
on
englehart
again
and
when
i
shook
my
head
drearily
for
all
reply
begged
that
i
would
permit
her
to
state
my
case
to
raymond
who
might
in
turn
see
some
able
physician
about
me
and
procure
remedies
to
this
at
last
i
consented
the
consequence
was
what
i
had
hoped
it
might
be
raymond
came
in
person
and
i
had
at
last
the
opportunity
i
had
long
desired
of
seeing
her
alone
if
thoughtless
if
unrefined
according
to
my
views
of
good
breeding
she
was
still
young
and
vivacious
and
perhaps
besides
this
sufficiently
well
pleased
with
herself
to
be
generous
to
one
who
could
no
longer
be
her
rival
her
approach
was
heralded
by
a
note
from
bainrothe
full
of
his
characteristic
guileful
sophistry
and
cool
impertinence
it
ran
as
follows
i
still
possess
this
billet
with
others
of
his
inditing
along
with
a
snake
rattle
miriam
i
am
glad
to
hear
through
clayton
that
reaction
has
occurred
and
that
you
manifest
repentance
for
your
recent
violence
toward
one
who
always
means
you
well
a
little
jesting
on
the
part
of
your
guardian
my
dear
girl
should
meet
with
a
very
different
reception
and
handsome
women
must
submit
to
compliments
with
a
good
grace
or
run
the
risk
of
being
called
prudes
or
viragos
not
that
i
mean
to
apply
either
term
to
you
by
any
means
your
father
daughter
could
not
be
other
than
a
lady
even
if
she
tried
but
i
must
confess
your
manners
have
deteriorated
somewhat
since
you
went
into
voluntary
banishment
among
those
outlandish
people
i
have
heard
no
very
good
account
of
this
old
la
vigne
who
died
in
debt
it
seems
and
left
his
children
beggars
i
have
some
curiosity
to
know
whether
he
paid
your
salary
show
you
know
etc
it
is
now
october
by
the
end
of
this
month
i
hope
you
will
have
made
up
that
stubborn
mind
of
yours
truly
indomitable
as
i
often
say
to
evelyn
to
leave
seclusion
and
enter
your
family
once
more
in
the
only
way
you
can
do
so
respectably
after
what
has
occurred
as
a
married
woman
you
remember
the
french
song
which
i
was
always
fond
of
humming
est
on
si
bien
sein
de
sa
famille
how
appropriate
it
seems
to
your
condition
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
your
brother
has
appeared
on
the
tapis
and
that
he
has
had
the
audacity
to
propose
to
adopt
mabel
whom
he
claims
as
his
niece
he
seems
a
gentlemanly
person
enough
but
may
be
an
impostor
for
aught
i
know
the
young
lady
he
was
engaged
to
gregory
tells
me
perished
in
the
kosciusko
which
proves
a
relief
after
all
as
it
is
rumored
he
has
a
wife
in
europe
but
such
gossip
can
hardly
interest
you
very
vividly
the
man
has
gone
to
california
and
will
probably
return
no
more
did
you
or
did
you
not
meet
this
person
at
colonel
la
vigne
favraud
hinted
something
of
the
kind
when
he
was
here
but
i
can
get
no
satisfaction
from
gregory
they
all
believe
you
were
drowned
in
georgia
and
i
thought
it
best
for
the
present
not
to
undeceive
favraud
who
laments
your
fate
the
surprise
will
be
all
the
more
pleasant
and
of
course
every
thing
will
be
explained
to
the
satisfaction
of
friends
when
you
appear
publicly
as
the
wife
of
luke
gregory
secretly
married
you
see
it
will
be
necessary
to
go
back
a
little
to
save
appearances
on
account
of
ernie
the
miscreant
i
understood
him
now
oh
my
god
for
strength
to
tear
his
cowardly
heart
from
his
truculent
body
but
no
let
there
be
no
further
unavailing
anger
in
god
good
time
all
should
recoil
on
his
own
head
for
the
present
i
must
bear
and
make
myself
insensible
if
possible
and
yet
i
would
not
willingly
have
had
the
living
greenness
of
my
spirit
turned
to
stone
as
we
are
told
branches
are
in
some
strange
foreign
rivers
another
extract
the
closing
one
and
then
forever
away
with
basil
bainrothe
and
his
flimsy
letters
again
i
must
congratulate
you
on
the
subdued
and
humbled
temper
you
manifest
claude
and
evelyn
and
i
had
just
been
discussing
a
plan
for
removing
you
to
another
asylum
where
stricter
discipline
and
less
luxurious
externals
are
employed
to
conquer
the
otherwise
unmanageable
inmates
englehart
you
know
holds
up
the
theory
of
indulgence
to
his
patients
and
i
am
rejoiced
to
find
his
measures
have
at
last
prevailed
over
your
frenzy
mabel
like
your
other
friends
believes
you
dead
and
is
at
home
with
evelyn
and
claude
and
is
growing
in
beauty
and
intelligence
every
day
she
was
quite
shocked
at
her
uncle
wild
behavior
and
positively
refused
to
go
with
him
is
fond
of
gregory
and
remembers
you
with
affection
owing
to
my
knowledge
of
your
condition
for
the
last
year
my
dear
child
i
do
blame
you
for
any
thing
that
is
past
not
even
for
those
delusions
with
regard
to
my
own
acts
and
intentions
which
formed
your
mania
nor
for
the
misfortune
and
sense
of
shame
which
no
doubt
caused
your
hasty
flight
and
whose
evidences
you
brought
with
you
from
the
raft
in
the
shape
of
a
nearly
child
i
remain
faithfully
yours
the
shameful
accusations
which
brought
the
blood
to
my
brow
ought
to
have
been
easier
to
bear
than
all
the
rest
because
so
easily
confuted
and
because
i
knew
not
really
believed
but
they
were
not
the
very
idea
of
shame
humiliated
me
more
than
positive
could
have
done
and
spotless
though
i
knew
myself
to
be
as
others
knew
me
too
all
i
loved
and
cared
for
still
my
purity
was
shocked
by
such
injustice
i
felt
like
one
who
had
gone
out
to
walk
in
fresh
attire
and
been
by
rude
urchins
so
that
the
outward
robes
at
least
were
soiled
and
a
sense
of
degradation
and
uncleanness
became
the
consequence
in
spite
of
reason
but
after
all
the
dress
could
be
easily
changed
when
opportunity
should
occur
and
all
be
made
clean
again
and
the
forgotten
or
overlooked
and
the
urchins
punished
or
dismissed
in
scorn
surely
god
would
not
much
longer
permit
this
fiend
to
subjugate
me
had
i
not
suffered
sufficiently
alas
who
but
our
creator
can
judge
of
our
deserts
or
measure
our
power
to
bear
in
my
adversity
and
lonely
trouble
i
had
drawn
near
to
him
and
his
blessed
son
our
mediator
and
example
and
only
strength
dear
as
was
still
the
memory
of
that
earthly
love
the
only
real
passion
i
had
ever
known
could
ever
know
it
came
no
longer
to
my
spirit
as
a
substitute
for
religion
i
had
learned
to
separate
my
worship
of
god
from
my
fealty
to
man
yet
was
this
last
not
weakened
but
strengthened
by
such
discrimination
if
only
for
the
gift
of
grace
it
brought
to
we
let
me
bless
my
sad
captivity
chapter
xi
the
dreary
days
rolled
on
the
health
of
clayton
declined
so
rapidly
that
a
small
stove
was
found
necessary
to
the
comfort
of
her
contracted
bedroom
which
freed
me
from
the
unpleasant
necessity
of
her
actual
presence
the
was
set
aside
the
gingerbread
nuts
were
neglected
and
the
noise
of
constant
crunching
as
of
bones
came
no
more
from
my
dragon
den
nor
yet
the
smell
of
stilton
cheese
and
porter
wherewith
she
had
so
frequently
regaled
herself
and
nauseated
me
and
in
the
i
used
to
call
her
a
chronic
eater
a
symptom
i
believe
of
the
worst
sort
of
dyspepsia
as
well
as
too
often
its
occasion
i
prefer
myself
the
indian
notion
of
eating
seldom
and
enough
at
a
time
after
all
is
there
any
despot
equal
to
the
stomach
and
its
requisitions
what
an
injustice
it
seems
to
all
the
rest
of
the
organs
the
royal
brain
especially
that
this
selfish
sensual
sybarite
should
exact
tribute
and
even
enforce
concession
whenever
denied
its
customary
demands
there
are
human
beings
the
poor
of
the
earth
as
we
know
who
pass
their
whole
lives
merge
their
immortal
souls
in
ministering
to
its
absolute
necessities
who
go
cold
and
ignorant
to
keep
off
the
pangs
of
hunger
who
sacrifice
pride
and
affection
at
its
miserable
altar
there
are
others
fewer
in
number
it
is
true
but
scarcely
less
to
be
pitied
who
exceed
this
enforced
servility
in
the
most
abject
fashion
of
voluntary
adulation
who
flatter
persuade
and
bring
rich
tribute
to
this
smiling
moloch
only
waiting
his
own
time
to
turn
upon
and
destroy
his
idolaters
for
the
pampered
stomach
like
all
other
spoiled
potentates
is
treacherous
and
ungrateful
beyond
belief
yet
the
philosophers
tell
us
man
necessity
for
food
lies
at
the
root
of
civilization
and
that
the
desire
for
a
sufficiency
and
variety
of
aliment
alone
keeps
up
our
energies
i
can
not
think
so
i
believe
it
is
the
stone
about
our
necks
that
drags
us
down
and
is
intended
to
do
so
and
which
keeps
us
truly
from
being

a
little
lower
than

the
vulgarian
who
whatever
she
was
and
however
detestable
the
part
she
was
playing
was
at
least
possessed
of
womanly
sympathy
came
frequently
to
see
me
during
those
weary
days
her
engagement
to
bainrothe
was
never
by
her
acknowledged
or
by
me
alluded
to
and
she
seemed
to
have
taken
up
the
impression
in
some
way
that
i
was
the
victim
of
an
unfortunate
attachment
to
that
subtle
person
which
had
degenerated
into
a
morbid
and
causeless
hatred
on
my
part
leading
to
mania
had
she
stated
this
conviction
plainly
i
might
have
been
tempted
to
undeceive
her
as
it
was
i
suffered
the
error
to
continue
knowing
that
no
condition
of
belief
would
influence
her
half
so
kindly
toward
me
women
as
a
class
have
a
sincere
friendship
for
those
who
have
undergone
slighting
treatment
at
the
hands
of
their
lovers
and
husbands
and
we
all
know
what
a
common
trick
of
trade
it
is
with
men
who
have
been
unsuccessful
in
their
attempts
to
gain
a
woman
affections
or
worse
in
their
evil
designs
on
her
honor
to
give
out
such
mendacious
impressions
yet
to
the
end
of
time
the
vanity
and
credulity
of
women
will
lead
them
to
lend
credence
to
such
statements
rather
than
look
matters
firmly
in
the
face
with
the
eyes
of
and
experience
i
for
one
am
a
very
skeptic
on
this
subject
of
manly
dislike
growing
out
of
female
susceptibility
and
usually
take
the
conservative
view
of
the
question
during
one
of
these
condescending
visits
of
the
lady
anastasia
whose
position
toward
bainrothe
i
perfectly
comprehended
through
the
inadvertence
it
may
be
remembered
of
clayton
i
ventured
to
ask
her
whether
she
had
met
with
her
betrothed
as
she
had
expected
to
do
on
landing
at
new
york
and
when
her
marriage
was
to
take
place
whenever
you
come
out
of
this
retirement
dear
not
before
you
see
i
have
set
my
heart
on
you
for
my
bridesmaid
with
your
permission
then
bainrothe
has
concluded
to
annul
the
condition
of
my
marriage
before
leaving
the
asylum
oh
i
had
forgotten
about
that
well
we
will
have
the
ceremony
performed
together
if
you
prefer
down
in
you
reside
here
then
i
questioned
you
are
at
home
in
this
house
whosesoever
it
may
be
oh
no
you
quite
misunderstand
me
i
am
staying
with
friends
and
bainrothe
is
over
at
home
with
his
son
and
with
a
jerk
of
her
head
in
the
right
direction
in
the
other
city
i
mean
i
am
such
a
stranger
i
forget
names
sometimes
this
you
know
is
solely
englehart
establishment
i
suppose
that
gentleman
is
absent
as
i
have
not
seen
him
lately
i
continued
he
has
been
absent
but
has
just
returned
he
speaks
of
calling
i
believe
very
soon
to
see
you
on
the
part
of
gregory
how
happy
you
are
to
inspire
such
a
passion
in
the
heart
of
that
splendid
man
and
she
rolled
her
eyes
and
drew
up
her
square
flat
shoulders
expressively
do
tell
me
where
you
knew
him
and
all
about
it
i
am
sure
he
is
much
more
suitable
to
you
in
age
and
intellect
than
than
even
mr
bainrothe
there
is
no
question
of
him
now
i
responded
gravely
purposely
misunderstanding
her
he
has
been
married
some
time
to
my
evelyn
erie
and
i
suppose
with
many
of
my
other
friends
believes
me
dead
oh
no
i
assure
you
she
rejoined
with
some
confusion
it
is
a
mistake
altogether
both
and
claude
bainrothe
are
perfectly
aware
of
your
seclusion
and
he
especially
recommended
and
contrived
it
there
contrivance
then
you
admit
that
i
said
impressively
at
this
juncture
a
feeble
voice
from
the
adjoining
room
was
heard
calling
aloud
and
i
listened
to
it
uplifted
as
it
was
evidently
in
tones
of
remonstrance
and
reproof
for
some
moments
afterward
the
lady
anastasia
having
hastened
with
dutiful
alacrity
to
the
bedside
of
her
servant
i
became
aware
after
this
visit
that
raymond
had
become
my
jailer
as
well
as
her
mother
she
came
regularly
at
thereafter
to
superintend
dinah
arrangements
to
give
clayton
her
which
did
not
assuage
her
direful
vigilance
one
particle
but
rather
seemed
to
infuse
new
powers
of
wakefulness
in
those
eyes
until
sunrise
when
protected
by
the
knowledge
that
others
besides
herself
were
on
the
watch
she
permitted
sleep
to
take
possession
of
her
senses
i
earnestly
believe
that
no
one
ever
so
effectually
controlled
the
predisposition
to
slumber
as
did
this
woman
after
locking
us
up
regularly
for
the
night
the
lady
anastasia
withdrew
followed
by
dinah
and
i
would
hear
later
sounds
of
festivity
in
which
her
laugh
was
blended
in
the
below
where
with
bainrothe
and
his
friends
she
held
wassail
frequently
until
after
midnight
the
groans
of
clayton
would
then
commence
and
with
little
intermission
last
until
morning
light
yet
it
was
something
to
be
rid
of
raymond
surveillance
during
those
very
hours
i
had
selected
for
my
second
effort
to
escape
this
must
be
hazarded
i
knew
between
eight
and
ten
of
the
evening
during
which
time
i
had
reason
to
suppose
the
remained
unlocked
the
risk
of
encountering
some
one
in
the
hall
below
for
there
was
constant
passing
and
repassing
of
footsteps
during
those
hours
constituted
my
chief
danger
but
at
all
hazards
the
experiment
must
then
if
at
all
be
made
october
was
fast
drifting
away
and
i
knew
that
at
its
close
my
course
would
be
decided
for
me
should
i
not
anticipate
such
despotism
by
setting
it
at
naught
in
the
only
possible
way
that
of
flying
from
the
scene
of
my
oppression
how
to
do
this
and
when
became
the
one
problem
of
my
existence
and
it
was
well
for
me
that
clayton
was
too
great
a
sufferer
to
notice
beyond
my
external
safety
or
she
might
have
seen
clear
indications
of
some
strange
change
at
work
stamped
upon
my
features
my
unsettled
intentions
were
suddenly
brought
to
a
crisis
by
the
contents
of
a
letter
handed
to
me
as
usual
in
the
shadows
of
the
evening
by
the
englehart
who
came
in
person
in
accordance
with
raymond
announcement
arriving
as
it
chanced
while
clayton
slumbered
to
deliver
it
gregory
wrote
a
large
clear
hand
not
difficult
to
decipher
even
by
the
dim
light
of
a
moonlight
lamp
and
while
englehart
stood
regarding
me
in
the
shadow
anxiously
enough
i
perceived
to
keep
me
entirely
on
my
guard
i
perused
with
mingled
derision
and
terror
this
truly
characteristic
epistle
my
running
commentaries
as
i
read
entirely
of
course
for
one
does
not
care
to
rouse
the
wrath
of
a
tiger
on
the
crouch
by
flinging
pebbles
in
the
jungle
may
give
some
idea
of
the
impression
it
made
upon
me
and
the
emotions
it
excited
beloved
miriam
insolent
cur
for
by
this
tender
title
i
am
permitted
to
address
you
at
last
by
whom
i
can
not
flatter
myself
that
in
concurring
with
the
wishes
of
your
friends
you
return
my
fervent
passion
you
are
mistaken
there
i
do
return
it
with
the
seal
unbroken
but
will
you
not
suffer
me
to
hope
that
the
deep
disinterested
devotion
of
mouths
may
undo
the
past
and
dissolve
those
bitter
prejudices
which
i
feet
well
aware
were
instilled
into
your
heart
by
one
of
the
coldest
and
most
time
serving
of
men
of
course
hope
is
free
to
all
it
is
no
longer
kept
in
a
box
as
in
the
days
of
pandora
when
i
assure
you
that
wentworth
with
a
perfect
knowledge
of
your
present
situation
has
repudiated
the
past
you
will
more
perfectly
understand
my
reference
i
will
believe
this
when
he
tells
me
so
not
before
your
assertion
simply
reassures
me
it
is
not
however
to
place
my
own
devotion
in
contrast
with
his
perfidy
that
i
now
address
you
nature
drew
the
contrast
fortunately
for
him
without
your
assistance
but
to
beseech
you
for
your
own
sake
to
let
nothing
turn
you
from
your
resolution
i
do
intend
to
let
any
thing
turn
me
if
i
can
help
it
this
time
it
remains
with
you
to
live
a
free
and
happy
life
adored
and
indulged
by
one
who
would
give
his
heart
blood
to
serve
you
a
poor
gift
i
take
it
or
pass
your
whole
existence
in
the
cell
of
a
lunatic
cut
off
from
every
being
who
could
care
for
or
protect
you
great
heavens
what
can
the
wretch
mean
should
you
refuse
to
become
my
wife
and
affix
your
signature
to
the
papers
in
your
possession
i
have
reason
to
know
that
bainrothe
designs
to
make
or
rather
continue
you
dead
and
imprison
you
in
a
lonely
house
on
the
which
he
owns
where
others
of
his
victims
have
before
now
lived
and
died
unknown
very
melodramatic
truly
but
i
do
believe
cagliostro
would
dare
to
do
it
to
convince
you
of
the
truth
of
my
allegations
englehart
is
instructed
to
place
in
your
hands
a
note
recently
intercepted
by
me
from
that
to
his
son
which
please
return
to
him
my
truest
friend
direst
enemy
you
mean
along
with
this
letter
as
i
send
you
both
documents
at
my
own
peril
and
dare
not
leave
them
in
your
hands
how
magnanimous
and
here
i
dropped
the
letter
on
the
table
and
extended
my
hand
mutely
to
englehart
for
the
note
which
was
ready
for
me
in
the
hollow
of
his
pudgy
palm
it
did
indeed
most
clearly
confirm
the
statement
true
or
false
of
the
ubiquitous
gregory
returning
it
to
the
physician
i
then
continued
the
perusal
of
this
singular
to
the
end
in
which
the
lawyer
and
knave
predominated
in
spite
of
eros
yet
there
was
food
for
consideration
here
and
extremest
terror
how
long
before
this
ultimatum
is
proposed
to
me
which
gregory
seemed
to
anticipate
and
with
which
you
no
doubt
are
acquainted
i
asked
coldly
after
consideration
ten
days
will
close
up
de
whole
transaction
as
i
understand
was
the
no
less
cool
reply
made
in
those
husky
inimitable
tones
peculiar
to
the
man
of
petty
pills
ten
days
it
would
seem
a
short
time
wherein
to
get
up
a
reasonable
trousseau
even
true
true
but
nosing
of
dat
kind
is
necessaire
under
dese
circumstances
only
your
mos
gracious
and
graceful
consent
he
spoke
eagerly
with
bowed
head
and
clasped
hands
standing
mutely
before
me
when
he
had
concluded
if
gregory
loved
me
truly
he
would
not
limit
me
thus
i
hazarded
he
would
give
me
time
to
learn
to
return
his
affection
as
i
must
try
to
do
and
to
forget
the
past
he
would
not
strike
hands
with
my
persecutors
but
insist
on
my
liberation
or
obtain
it
as
he
could
readily
do
without
their
coÃ¶peration
through
you
englehart
who
seem
to
be
his
friend
and
ally
and
who
have
already
run
such
risks
for
his
sake
in
bringing
me
these
two
dangerous
letters
and
as
i
spoke
i
pushed
them
across
the
table
to
be
gathered
up
and
concealed
with
eagerness
how
perfectly
he
played
his
part
and
how
cunningly
bainrothe
had
contrived
to
convey
to
me
his
menace
real
or
assumed
for
effect
i
could
not
tell
which
for
my
judgment
spoke
one
language
my
cowardice
another
yet
i
confess
that
the
panic
was
complete
though
i
concealed
it
from
the
enemy
women
usually
at
least
romantic
and
incredulous
women
like
me
demand
some
proof
of
a
lover
devotion
i
resumed
as
coolly
as
i
could
before
yielding
him
their
faith
and
fealty
but
gregory
has
given
me
no
evidence
so
far
of
the
sincerity
of
his
passion
i
confess
i
find
it
difficult
under
the
circumstances
to
believe
in
its
existence
he
drew
near
to
me
bent
eagerly
above
me
then
again
concealed
himself
as
it
was
wise
for
him
to
do
in
shadow
and
i
could
hear
his
hissing
breath
as
it
passed
between
his
closed
teeth
like
that
of
a
roused
serpent
the
impulse
of
the
man
came
near
betraying
him
but
he
rallied
and
refrained
from
an
exposure
as
he
would
have
supposed
it
that
must
have
been
fatal
to
his
success
as
a
lover
even
if
it
confirmed
his
power
of
possession
his
tones
low
and
deep
were
unmistakably
those
of
suppressed
passion
when
he
spoke
again
and
he
had
almost
dropped
his
accent
so
wonderfully
assumed
when
shall
he
come
to
you
and
speak
for
himself
let
me
take
to
him
some
word
of
encouragement
from
your
lips
for
de
love
of
whom
he
languishes
he
dies
all
other
passions
of
his
life
have
proved
like
cobwebs
compared
to
this
avarice
ambition
revenge
all
yield
before
it
he
is
your
slave
do
not
trample
on
a
fervent
heart
thus
laid
at
your
feet
have
mercy
on
this
unfortunate
strange
language
from
a
captor
to
a
captive
mocking
language
that
i
find
unendurable
let
gregory
remain
where
he
is
until
the
extreme
limit
of
the
interval
granted
me
by
basil
bainrothe
as
before
execution
and
before
hope
expires
in
thick
darkness
then
let
him
come
and
take
what
he
will
find
of
the
victim
of
so
much
perfidy
you
do
not
you
can
not
meditate
personal
violence
he
spoke
in
a
voice
of
agony
that
could
scarcely
be
restrained
from
breaking
into
its
natural
tones
no
no
do
not
flatter
yourselves
that
i
could
be
driven
by
you
by
one
to
such
i
hastened
to
say
for
i
felt
the
importance
of
keeping
this
barrier
of
disguise
of
ice
between
gregory
and
myself
as
a
means
of
safety
for
a
season
and
determined
that
he
should
not
transcend
it
if
i
could
prevent
an
such
as
his
excited
feelings
made
imminent
my
hopes
are
dead
say
this
to
gregory
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
i
should
fare
as
well
in
his
hands
as
in
any
other
knowing
him
as
i
know
him
to
be
and
i
hesitated
here
for
a
moment
gentle
compassionate
faithful
where
his
feelings
are
fairly
enlisted
he
thanks
you
through
my
lips
most
lovely
lady
for
dis
great
proof
of
consideration
dis
message
which
i
shall
truthfully
deliver
will
fill
his
heart
with
joy
long
a
stranger
to
his
breast
for
he
has
feared
your
hatred
now
go
englehart
and
let
no
one
come
to
me
without
previous
warning
for
i
need
all
my
strength
to
bear
me
up
in
this
emergency
nor
would
i
meet
gregory
without
due
preparation
even
of
apparel
and
i
glanced
at
my
dress
of
spotted
lawn
faded
and
unseasonable
as
it
seemed
in
the
autumn
weather
i
know
his
fastidiousness
on
this
subject
and
from
this
time
it
ought
to
it
must
be
my
study
to
try
to
please
him
why
was
not
the
fate
of
ananias
or
sapphira
mine
after
that
false
utterance
why
did
i
triumph
in
the
strength
of
guile
that
desperation
gave
me
rather
than
sink
abashed
and
penitent
beneath
it
and
this
was
the
woman
who
had
once
lectured
on
duplicity
and
expediency
and
deemed
herself
above
them
bitter
and
nauseous
as
was
this
bowl
to
me
i
drank
it
without
a
grimace
so
much
depended
on
the
measure
of
deceit
hope
love
honor
life
itself
perhaps
for
my
terrors
whispered
that
even
such
warnings
as
those
gregory
had
given
were
not
to
be
disregarded
where
there
was
question
of
success
or
failure
to
basil
bainrothe
but
one
alternative
presented
itself
escape
delay
i
scarce
could
hope
for
and
even
if
granted
how
could
it
avail
me
in
the
end
those
words
he
will
make
you
dead
rang
in
my
ears
and
seemed
written
on
the
wall
they
confronted
me
everywhere
it
was
so
easy
to
do
this
easy
to
repeat
what
the
papers
had
already
told
the
world
so
easy
to
confine
me
in
a
maniac
cell
under
an
assumed
name
and
by
the
aid
of
my
own
gold
and
say
she
perished
at
sea
it
would
be
to
the
interest
of
all
who
knew
it
to
preserve
the
secret
except
the
poor
ship
captain
and
he
had
been
a
dupe
and
would
scarcely
recognize
his
folly
or
if
he
did
be
the
first
to
boast
of
and
publish
it
besides
that
should
the
matter
be
inquired
into
how
easy
for
bainrothe
to
allege
that
my
own
family
had
sanctioned
his
course
to
save
my
reputation
for
innuendo
was
over
on
this
disgraceful
subject
he
had
declared
openly
his
base
design
years
might
elapse
before
the
final
exposition
years
of
utter
ruin
to
my
prospects
and
my
hopes
wentworth
might
be
married
by
that
time
or
indifferent
or
dead
ernie
too
old
to
make
the
matter
of
a
year
or
two
of
consequence
in
the
carrying
out
of
the
nefarious
scheme
to
sustain
which
it
would
be
so
easy
to
summon
and
suborn
witnesses
all
these
possibilities
represented
themselves
to
me
with
frightful
distinctness
my
mind
became
imbued
with
them
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
of
reason
even
i
was
literally
and
nothing
but
flight
could
satisfy
my
instinct
my
impulse
of
i
must
go
even
if
blown
like
a
leaf
before
the
gales
of
heaven
must
fly
if
even
to
certainty
of
destruction
i
had
felt
this
necessity
once
before
be
it
remembered
but
never
so
stringently
so
morbidly
as
now
i
was
yielding
under
the
agony
the
anxiety
incident
to
my
condition
my
nervous
system
too
severely
taxed
was
breaking
down
and
it
would
succumb
entirely
unless
relief
came
to
me
of
this
i
felt
convinced
before
another
weary
month
should
roll
away
had
i
been
imprisoned
for
a
certain
term
of
years
as
an
expiation
for
crimes
i
think
i
could
have
borne
it
better
but
the
injustice
the
uncertainty
of
these
proceedings
were
more
than
i
could
sustain
i
fell
asleep
i
remember
on
the
night
of
my
interview
with
gregory
englehart
to
dream
confusedly
of
baron
trenck
and
his
iron
collar
and
the
princess
amelia
and
her
unmitigated
grief
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
given
to
drink
from
a
cup
the
poor
prisoner
had
carved
as
memoirs
tell
us
he
carved
and
sold
many
such
filled
with
a
sort
of
bitter
wine
by
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
so
vividly
did
fancy
mixing
her
ingredients
typify
the
anguish
of
my
waking
moments
and
reproduce
its
anxieties
in
dreams
of
night
that
could
not
be
controlled
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
it
was
to
lie
quietly
and
listen
to
the
doleful
voice
of
sabra
for
such
had
been
dinah
congo
name
uplifted
in
what
site
called
a
speritual
as
she
cleaned
the
brass
mountings
of
the
grate
and
kindled
its
tardy
fires
with
very
slight
alteration
and
adjustment
this
picturesque
and
dramatic
obi
hymn
is
given
in
this
place
just
as
i
jotted
it
down
in
my
diary
thus
imprinting
it
on
my
memory
from
her
own
lips
and
lungs
her
forefathers
she
informed
me
with
considerable
pride
had
been
and
she
certainly
inherited
their
tendency
to
treat
the
worst
enemy
of
mankind
with
respectful
adoration
it
served
to
divert
my
mind
from
its
one
fixed
idea
for
a
little
time
to
arrange
this
singular
hymn
which
together
with
those
she
had
given
voice
to
on
the
raft
proved
her
poetic
powers
for
sabra
assured
me
that
this
gift
of
sacred
song
had
come
to
her
one
day
when
she
was
washing
her
master
linen
and
that
she
had
felt
it
run
cold
streaks
down
her
back
and
through
her
brain
and
that
from
that
time
she
was
uplifted
to
sing
sperituals
by
spells
and
seasons
this
her
longest
and
most
successful
inspiration
i
now

chapter
xii
during
these
last
days
of
my
captivity
clayton
was
truly
a
piteous
sight
to
see
swathed
in
flannel
and
helpless
as
an
infant
yet
still
perversely
vigilant
as
she
had
been
in
her
hours
of
health
and
determined
on
the
subject
of
opiates
as
before
i
sometimes
think
she
feared
to
place
herself
wholly
in
my
hands
as
she
must
have
been
under
the
influence
of
a
powerful
anodyne
and
that
in
spite
of
her
professions
of
confidence
and
even
affection
she
feared
me
as
her
foe
god
knows
that
had
it
been
to
save
my
own
life
i
would
not
have
harmed
one
hair
of
her
viperish
head
as
flat
on
top
as
if
the
stone
of
the
indian
had
been
bound
upon
its
crown
from
babyhood
yet
full
of
brains
to
bursting
around
the
base
of
the
skull
it
was
necessary
for
dinah
to
be
in
constant
attendance
on
my
argus
and
even
to
feed
her
so
helpless
were
her
hands
with
the
mucilages
which
now
formed
her
principal
diet
by
the
order
of
some
celebrated
physician
who
wrote
his
prescriptions
without
seeing
his
patient
after
the
form
of
the
ancients
sending
them
daily
through
the
hands
of
raymond
still
those
vigilant
green
eyes
never
faltered
in
their
task
and
lying
where
with
the
door
opened
between
our
chambers
as
she
tyrannically
required
it
to
be
most
of
the
time
she
could
command
a
view
of
almost
every
act
of
my
life
i
found
her
scrutiny
more
unendurable
than
when
she
had
at
least
feigned
to
be
absorbed
with
her
ernie
noise
too
disturbed
her
and
i
was
obliged
to
keep
him
constantly
amused
for
fear
that
her
wrath
might
culminate
in
eternal
banishment
the
days
slid
on
november
had
passed
through
that
exquisite
phase
of
existence
which
almost
redeems
it
from
the
reproach
cast
upon
it
through
all
time
of
being
excellence
gloomy
month
of
the
year
the
sweet
and
balmy
influences
of
which
had
reached
us
even
through
the
walls
of
our
in
the
shape
of
smoky
sunshine
and
balmy
odorous
and
lingering
blossoms
and
was
now
asserting
its
traditional
character
with
much
angry
bluster
of
sleet
and
storm
and
cutting
wind
it
was
herod
lamenting
his
marianne
slain
by
his
own
hand
and
making
others
suffer
the
consequences
of
his
regretted
cruelty
his
remorseful
anguish
it
was
the
fierce
viking
making
wild
wail
over
his
dead
oriana
no
more
to
come
until
another
year
had
done
its
work
of
resurrection
and
decay
the
lovely
indian
summer
slumbered
under
her
mound
of
withered
flowers
and
heaps
of
gorgeous
leaves
unheeding
all
or
unconscious
of
the
grief
of
her
stern
bridegroom
cold
and
bitter
and
bleak
howled
the
november
blast
and
ruthlessly
drove
the
fleet
against
the
shivering
panes
exposed
without
though
shielded
within
by
venetian
folding
shutters
on
that
gray
morning
when
a
passing
whisper
from
most
unlovely
and
altogether
unfaithful
lips
nerved
me
paradoxically
to
sudden
resolution
false
as
i
knew
old
dinah
to
be
almost
on
principle
still
i
could
not
disregard
the
possible
truth
of
her
passing
warning
given
in
broken
whisper
first
as
she
poured
out
my
tea
and
afterward
prepared
my
bath

dinah
and
open
the

for

i
can
write
your
song
down
just
as
well
another
time
i
remonstrated
taking
up
and
laying
down
my
as
i
spoke
so
as
to
display
my
ostensible
occupation
to
the
peering
eyes
of
clayton
now
sitting
bolt
upright
in
her
bed
looking
like
a
chinese
bonze
for
the
purpose
of
sweeping
in
my
position
definitively
that
will
do
dinah
now
go
and
get
miss
monfort
bath
ready
i
heard
my
dragoness
say
after
a
short
whispered
communication
from
her
early
visitor
it
was
the
idea
probably
to
remove
me
as
well
as
dinah
while
the
plot
was
being
unfolded
and
my
with
its
closed
door
promised
security
from
quick
ears
and
eyes
to
the
brace
of
conspirators
now
plotting
their
final
blow
once
in
that
belfry
and
truly
might
the
sense
of
dante
famous
inscription
become
my
motto
for
life
here
hope
is
left
behind
i
covered
my
eyes
as
i
recalled
that
dreary
dreadful
of
clock
and
bell
into
which
i
had
clambered
once
by
means
of
a
movable
rarely
left
there
by
the
attendant
in
order
to
rescue
my
famished
cat
shut
up
there
by
accident
i
recollected
the
maddened
look
of
the
creature
as
it
flew
by
me
like
a
flash
frightened
out
of
its
wits
austin
had
said
by
the
clicking
of
the
machinery
of
the
huge
clock
and
the
chiming
of
the
responsive
bell
both
were
silent
now
and
there
was
room
enough
for
a
prisoner
cot
in
that
lonely
and
dismantled
turret
as
there
once
had
been
for
a
telescope
and
its
rest
used
for
astronomical
purposes
at
long
intervals
by
my
father
and
a
few
of
his
scientific
friends
but
finally
dismantled
and
put
aside
forever
i
could
imagine
myself
a
denizen
at
the
will
of
bainrothe
of
that
weird
gray
belfry
shut
up
with
that
silent
clock
in
company
with
a
bed
a
chair
and
table
denied
perchance
even
the
comfort
of
a
stove
for
fear
the
flue
might
utter
smoke
and
with
it
that
kind
of
revelation
said
proverbially
to
accompany
such
manifestations
denied
books
even
the
sight
of
a
human
face
and
furnished
with
food
merely
sufficing
in
quantity
and
quality
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
could
i
resist
this
state
of
things
could
i
sustain
it
and
retain
my
reason
no
i
felt
that
the
picture
my
fancy
drew
if
realized
would
make
me
abject
and
submissive
change
me
to
a
cowardly
cringing
slave
i
was
not
made
of
the
right
stuff
for
martyrdom
only
for
battle
for
resistance
and
would
put
forth
my
last
powers
in
the
effort
to
save
myself
from
the
unendurable
trials
before
me
even
if
destruction
were
the
consequence
a
in
my
brain
would
he
preferable
to
what
i
saw
awaiting
me
should
bainrothe
succeed
in
his
stratagem
as
i
doubted
not
he
would
do
if
determined
on
it
i
should
know
freedom
in
its
true
sense
never
again
if
that
night
were
suffered
to
pass
without
its
redemption
if
that
belfry
once
were
entered
as
carelessly
as
i
could
i
followed
dinah
to
the
ostensibly
to
direct
the
temperature
of
the
water
but
really
to
draw
out
from
her
all
that
was
possible
while
the
mood
of
communication
possessed
her
on
the
subject
so
vital
to
me
and
my
welfare
life
and
death
almost
were
involved
in
her
revelations
and
i
hastened
to
wind
in
the
clew
while
it
lingered
in
my
hand
for
i
knew
that
she
was
an
eccentric
as
well
as
a
selfish
creature
and
might
suddenly
see
fit
to
withdraw
or
snap
its
thread
now
tell
me
about
mcdermot
dinah
what
sort
of
a
look
has
he
is
he
large
or
small
light
or
dark
and
does
he
smoke
a
pipe
he
is
a
great
big
man
honey
wid
red
har
an
sort
ob
eyes
mos
while
sometimes
he
rolls
em
up
in
his
head
an
he
smells
mighty
strong
of
whisky
i
tells
you
all
his
bref
mos
knocked
me
down
but
i
did
see
no
pipe
a
discouraging
account
truly
yet
i
persevered
it
seemed
my
only
hope
to
enlist
this
man
on
my
side
either
through
his
sympathies
or
sense
of
duty
i
had
no
power
to
command
his
services
on
the
side
of
his
avarice
the
ring
on
my
finger
the
pledge
of
wentworth
troth
a
massive
circlet
of
chased
gold
was
all
that
remained
to
me
in
the
shape
of
valuables
i
did
not
possess
a
stiver
in
that
prison
nor
own
even
the
clothes
on
my
back
could
you
not
take
him
a
message
from
me
dinah
it
is
his
duty
you
know
to
assist
me
it
is
on
my
account
doubtless
he
is
placed
here
and
hereafter
i
can
reward
him
liberally
and
you
too
just
now
you
know
i
am
penniless
the
woman
stopped
and
looked
at
me

small
black
irises

set

extensive
whites

suffused
and
bloodshot

dun

emphatically
the

of

surly
sable
without
who
in
raymond
absence
officiated
as
our
jailer
and
cerberus
it
was
early
evening
when
dinah
returned
for
she
brought
to
us
but
two
meals
at
this
season
the
necessary
food
for
ernie
being
always
ready
in
a
closet
she
came
ushered
in
as
usual
by
raymond
who
bore
with
her
on
this
occasion
what
she
called
savory
broth
concocted
by
her
own
fair
hands
for
the
benefit
of
her
suffering
parent
while
clayton
was
employed
in
supping
this
mutton
abomination
with
a
loud
noise
peculiar
to
the
vulgar
and
raymond
whispering
inaudible
words
above
the
bowl
i
was
ostensibly
employed
in
tearing
a
croquet
to
pieces
with
my
fork
while
i
interrogated
dinah
in
a
low
even
voice
between
each
shred
unintelligible
i
knew
in
the
next
room
through
its
monotony
on
the
success
of
her
mission
and

you
old
limb
of
satan
or
i
shall
be
after
you
with
a
mop
cried
the
laughing
voice
of
raymond
from
the
side
of
the
sick
woman
bed
betraying
at
once
how
she
had
divided
her
attention
then
advancing
into
my
chamber
she
added
as
coolly
as
though
she
had
been
suggesting
a
visit
to
the
theatre
excuse
me
miss
monfort
for
intruding
but
i
am
about
to
ask
you
whether
it
would
be
agreeable
to
you
to
be
married
at
ten
this
seems
very
sudden
but
circumstances
have
forced
the
arrangement
on
us
all
and
i
assure
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
it
is
for
both
of
us
the
preferable
alternative
of
evils
as
poor
sir
harry
raymond
would
have
said
alas
my
dear
shall
i
ever
again
have
such
a
helpmate
as
he
was
so
kind
so
generous
so
considerate
and
she
clasped
and
wrung
her
large
rosy
hands
a
second
marriage
is
often
a
great
sacrifice
and
in
any
case
a
hazard
as
i
feel
as
the
time
draws
near
very
sensibly
but
you
seem
confounded
and
yet
you
must
have
been
somewhat
prepared
for
this
condition
of
things
after
your
last
interview
with
dr
englehart
the
amazement
of
dinah
at
this
change
in
the
programme
if
possible
exceeded
my
own
she
did
not
understand
as
i
did
that
it
was
a
measure
prompted
not
only
by
humanity
but
and
that
even
the
hard
heart
of
basil
bainrothe
preferred
a
compromise
to
such
violence
and
injustice
as
those
he
had
otherwise
meditated
besides
what
better
or
more
sensible
mode
than
this
could
there
be
according
to
his
views
of
quashing
the
whole
quieting
official
inquiry
as
well
as
public
indignation
as
the
wife
of
gregory
i
should
be
of
course
for
life
walking
abroad
with
the
concealed
brand
and
manacle
afraid
and
ashamed
to
complain
and
acknowledge
my
condition
and
willing
to
condone
every
thing
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
my
true
policy
was
to
feign
a
reluctant
consent
to
this
proposition
and
to
determine
later
what
recourse
to
take
as
if
indeed
any
remained
to
me
in
that
den
of
serpents
i
would
consider
as
soon
as
raymond
was
gone
what
measures
to
pursue
in
order
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
mcdermot
the
detective
and
then
if
all
proved
vain
i
could
but
perish
for
i
would
have
walked
cheerfully
over
the
burning
ploughshares
of
old
lived
again
through
the
hideous
nightmare
of
the
burning
ship
and
raft
nay
clasped
hands
with
the
spectre
of
la
vigne
himself
had
it
offered
to
lead
me
to
purgatory
rather
than
have
married
the
knave
the
liar
the
gregory
my
resolution
was
soon
made
you
will
send
me
a
suitable
dress
i
suppose
i
said
calmly
you
know
i
am
a
pauper
here
yes
fortunately
i
have
two
almost
alike
which
shall
it
be
a
chally
or
barege
it
matters
little
the
color
is
all
i
care
for
let
it
be
white
i
have
a
superstition
about
being
married
in
colors
so
should
i
have
were
this
the
first
time
but
being
a
widow
i
shall
wear
a
trimmed
with
blond
made
up
for
a
very
different
occasion
yes
that
will
be
quite
suitable
well
the
long
agony
is
over
at
last
and
i
am
glad
of
it
and
i
drew
a
deep
free
breath
you
will
have
to
sign
the
papers
before
you
come
bainrothe
told
me
to
say
this
to
you
and
to
ask
you
to
have
them
ready
they
will
be
witnessed
below
with
the
marriage
and
at
nine
expect
me
to
appear
with
your
gown
and
make
your
toilet
will
not
bridget
maloney
do
as
well
i
asked
desperately
she
at
least
i
thought
may
be
compassionate
it
is
strange
you
should
know
of
her
at
all
or
she
of
you
it
is
that
girl
then
who
has
given
us
all
this
trouble
going
to
the
bed
when
i
did
not
suppose
she
knew
of
her
existence
explain
this
clayton
if
you
can
i
suppose
ernie
who
is
fond
of
her
has
mentioned
her
name
to
miss
monfort
she
thinks
his
mother
is
sick
but
knows
no
more
i
am
certain
besides
it
englehart
establishment
such
things
are
to
be
expected
and
surprise
no
one
of
the
attendants
bridget
is
kept
busy
among
them
all
the
farce
was
to
be
kept
up
it
seemed
to
the
end
old
dinah
was
evidently
quaking
in
her
shoes
and
began
to
see
her
error
as
she
glanced
reproachfully
at
me
but
no
further
revelation
seemed
to
be
expected
it
was
indeed
to
divert
partly
immediate
suspicion
from
one
i
still
hoped
to
make
my
tool
that
i
mentioned
the
irish
girl
at
all
or
craved
her
presence
but
i
soon
found
how
futile
in
one
instance
was
this
trust
no
sooner
had
raymond
turned
to
depart
than
dinah
followed
her
protesting
against
being
locked
up
the
whole
evening
with
the
invalid
and
begging
leave
to
go
out
for
an
hour
or
two
on
business
of
her
own
which
she
declared
important
but
miss
monfort
may
need
you
in
making
her
preparations
remonstrated
raymond
and
clayton
and
ernie
will
want
your
attention
besides
fires
will
go
down
if
not
constantly
mended
this
cold
evening
dar
plenty
of
coal
in
de
box
an
de
tongs
wid
claws
wat
ernie
is
so
fond
of
handlin
ready
and
waitin
for
dem
wat
strong
enough
to
use
dem
if
dey
choose
an
tea
in

an

jes
filled
up
de

in
de
closet
bread
an

on

an
i

anyway
case
my
ticklerest
friend
am
dyin
ob
de
numony
i
is
jes
got
word
but
at
nine
and
she
looked
maliciously
at
me
percisely
dinah
be
in
dis
pickin
patch
he
he
he
ca
possumbly
cum
no
airlier
in
a
flash
i
saw
the
advantage
her
prolonged
absence
would
give
me
unless
indeed
she
had
become
my
confederate
so
i
beheld
her
depart
with
a
feeling
of
relief
which
reacted
in
the
next
moment
to
positive
helplessness
and
terror
as
the
bolt
was
drawn
behind
her
what
could
i
do
what
was
there
to
be
done
for
a
time
i
sat
mute
and
crushed
by
consideration
then
casting
myself
on
my
bed
i
slept
for
half
an
hour
the
kind
of
slumber
that
confusion
generates
and
yet
i
woke
refreshed
calmed
comforted
and
with
a
resolution
and
plan
of
action
i
rose
and
approached
clayton
whose
groans
perhaps
aroused
me
and
as
i
stood
beside
her
bed
the
clock
in
the
dining
room
below
struck
six
i
had
still
three
hours
for
hope
for
endeavor
before
the
circle
of
flame
should
close
hopelessly
around
me
forever
three
hours
were
they
not
enough
could
i
not
compel
them
to
concentration
a
cup
of
strong
tea
was
hastily
drawn
and
swallowed
another
made
for
and
administered
by
my
hand
to
clayton
with
toast
a
tedious
process
and
afterward
ernie
supper
prepared
and
eaten
all
in
less
than
half
an
hour
by
seven
he
was
in
bed
and
asleep
and
i
had
taken
my
seat
by
clayton
for
the
purpose
apparently
of
merciful
ministry
to
her
condition
a
piece
of
as
it
seemed
and
as
she
felt
it
scarcely
to
be
expected
on
my
blissful
marriage
night
i
feel
very
sorry
for
you
you
suffer
so
clayton
i
had
said
as
i
drew
a
chair
beside
her
bed
and
i
for
you
miss
monfort
our
fate
seems
equally
hard
but
we
must
bear
it
and
she
groaned
heavily
and
closed
her
eyes
evidently
in
great
pain
i
have
come
to
that
conclusion
also
after
a
bitter
struggle
physical
pain
is
not
so
easily
borne
however
the
body
has
little
philosophy
i
thought
all
this
was
over
she
rejoined
abstractedly
when
my
hands
were
drawn
as
you
see
them
by
neuralgia
ten
years
since
but
i
did
not
suffer
as
much
then
i
believe
as
i
do
now
besides
i
was
younger
happier
better
able
to
bear
pain
yes
that
is
true
the
old
should
be
at
rest
at
least
my
sense
of
justice
whispered
this
then
after
a
pause
does
my
rubbing
ease
your
shoulder
mrs
clayton
somewhat
it
is
my
head
however
that
troubles
me
chiefly
be
good
enough
to
press
my
temples
ah
that
is
great
relief
you
are
very
kind
miss
monfort
yet
in
reviewing
the
past
i
hope
you
will
not
find
that
i
have
been
wanting
to
you
in
my
turn
i
trust
we
shall
part
in
peace
and
meet
hereafter
as
friends
but
you
do
not
answer
me
pardon
me
i
was
thinking
this
is
a
crisis
you
know
this
night
decides
my
fate
for
good
or
ill
all
rests
with
merciful
god
yes
all
of
ourselves
we
are
helpless
of
course
it
is
a
comfort
to
me
i
confess
as
i
lie
here
to
feel
that
i
have
never
willingly
injured
a
to
think
that
i
but
bless
my
soul
miss
monfort
you
must
not
hold
me
down
in
that
way
you
would
not
i
trust
but
even
if
you
did
no
key
this
time
the
door
is
fast
without
oh
not
for
worlds
be
still
the
pain
will
pass
i
have
the
gift
you
know
of
soothing
physical
suffering
there
rest
you
must
not
stir
give
yourself
up
to
me
if
you
can
slumber
will
come
it
must
not
come
see
we
are
all
alone
her
glazing
eye
her
slower
breathing
began
already
to
attest
the
influence
of
the
electric
fluid
so
potent
in
my
veins
so
wanting
in
her
own
both
from
temperament
and
disease
yet
she
resisted
bravely
and
long
and
even
when
her
limbs
were
powerless
her
spirit
rebelled
against
me
in
murmured
words
of
defiant
opposition
but
this
too
yielded
finally
to
silence
and
to
stupor
and
she
slept
the
deep
calm
unmistakable
slumber
caused
by
magnetism
then
again
i
went
through
the
experiment
of
the
preceding
night
and
strove
to
awaken
her
get
up
i
said
and
yet
without
willing
that
she
should
do
so
raymond
is
here
to
show
you
her
and
bainrothe
calls
tell
them
to
let
me
sleep
do
do
disturb
me
i
am
so
happy
so
peaceful
it
is
sweet
too
to
think
that
she
will
be
married
at
last
poor
thing
it
was
no
fault
of
hers
though
no
fault
a
young
actress
is
exposed
to
so
many
temptations
and
it
was
better
so
harry
mistress
that
secret
would
never
have
escaped
her
devoted
lips
had
she
been
able
to
retain
it
as
carefully
as
the
eyes
of
the
dead
are
closed
i
drew
down
her
gaping
lids
and
turned
away
as
i
did
so
the
clock
struck
eight
fatima
never
listened
more
anxiously
to
the
toll
of
parting
time
than
i
did
that
night
but
alas
for
me
no
sister
anne
kept
watch
on
the
tower
no
brother
hastened
to
arrest
the
sword
i
was
deserted
by
all
save
god
and
desperation
one
hour
comprised
my
fate
very
quietly
i
closed
the
door
between
clayton
room
and
my
own
the
bolt
was
on
the
other
side
so
i
could
not
secure
my
privacy
even
for
a
moment
should
she
chance
to
wake
or
should
raymond
or
dinah
return
unexpectedly
as
rapidly
as
i
could
i
altered
my
dress
this
time
above
my
clothes
threw
on
the
black
silk
frock
and
mantilla
prepared
for
me
on
shipboard
tied
a
dark
veil
over
my
head
an
old
woolen
scarf
about
my
throat
provided
for
ernie
and
croup
and
stood
equipped
for
my
enterprise
neither
bonnet
nor
gloves
nor
boots
did
i
possess
loan
having
long
since
been
condoned
on
behalf
of
some
one
else
and
my
clothing
in
my
captivity
had
been
contrived
to
suit
my
circumstances
wheeling
the
bedstead
very
gently
on
its
noiseless
castors
a
few
inches
from
the
wall
i
insinuated
myself
between
them
and
sheltered
by
the
loosened
again
the
covering
of
paper
that
concealed
the
door
and
fitted
into
the
the
wooden
key
which
once
before
had
proved
its
efficiency
it
did
not
fail
me
now
in
my
hour
of
extremity
for
a
moment
later
i
had
turned
and
removed
it
from
its
socket
stepped
forth
upon
the
landing
and
relocked
without
the
door
of
my
prison
but
perhaps
with
too
much
of
nervous
haste
too
little
caution
for
to
my
inexpressible
confusion
the
handle
of
the
instrument
of
my
emancipation
remained
in
my
hand
broken
off
at
the
lock
and
useless
forever
more
in
delaying
probable
pursuit
from
within
i
had
cut
off
all
possibility
of
my
own
retreat
in
case
of
failure
my
bridges
were
literally
burned
behind
me
and
i
had
no
alternative
left
between
flight
and
detection
and
yet
there
was
something
in
the
situation
that
inconsistently
enough
made
me
smile
albeit
with
a
trembling
heart
i
shook
my
head
drearily
as
a
couplet
from
collins
with
its
strange
appropriateness
irresistibly
crossed
my
brain
why
is
it
that
in
times
like
these
such
conceits
beset
us
such
comparisons
arise
does
the
quality
called
presence
of
mind
find
root
in
the
same
source
that
impels
us
to
apt
quotation
what
if
the
lion
in
his
rage
i
meet
oft
in
the
dust
i
see
his
printed
feet
i
gained
fresh
heart
from
that
trivial
diversion
of
thought
and
stood
quietly
contemplating
alternately
the
hall
below
and
that
above
both
of
which
were
visible
from
my
place
on
the
intermediate
platform
all
was
still
in
both
of
these
wide
corridors
to
make
sure
of
the
safety
of
my
enterprise
and
now
once
more
my
foot
was
on
the
brink
of
those
mysterious
stairs
which
led
i
felt
to
doom
or
to
liberty
i
commenced
very
cautiously
to
descend
them
the
at
their
foot
was
closed
and
all
seemed
silent
within
the
murmur
of
voices
and
the
remote
rattling
of
china
proceeding
from
the
ell
behind
the
hall
encouraged
me
to
believe
that
on
this
bitter
night
the
family
was
concentrated
for
greater
comfort
in
the
with
my
hand
on
the
baluster
pausing
at
every
step
i
crept
quietly
down
the
stairway
then
as
if
my
feet
were
suddenly
winged
with
terror
i
darted
by
the
flew
lightly
over
the
carpeted
hall
and
found
myself
in
another
moment
secure
within
the
small
enclosed
vestibule
into
which
the
door
of
entrance
gave
my
worst
misgivings
had
never
compassed
the
terrific
truth
at
this
early
hour
of
the
evening
not
only
was
the
front
door
locked
but
the
key
had
been
withdrawn
this
was
despair
my
knees
gave
way
beneath
me
and
i
sank
like
a
flaccid
heap
in
the
corner
against
one
of
the
leaves
of
the
small
that
divided
the
arched
vestibule
from
the
long
entry
and
which
was
secured
to
the
floor
by
a
bolt
while
the
other
one
was
thrown
back
crouched
in
the
shadow
powerless
to
move
or
think
i
heard
with
inexpressible
terror
the
door
of
the
study
open
and
the
voice
and
step
of
bainrothe
in
the
hall
approaching
me
had
he
heard
me
would
he
come
was
i
betrayed
i
felt
my
hair
rise
on
my
head
as
these
questions
rang
like
a
tocsin
through
my
brain
and
i
think
at
that
moment
i
had
a
foretaste
of
the
chief
agony
of
death
they
were
answered
by
bainrothe
himself
as
he
paused
midway
between
the
and
my
place
of
refuge
and
again
i
breathed
i
lived
i
was
mistaken
it
is
not
he
the
wind
probably
and
that
marble
looks
so
cold
so
uninviting
i
shall
not
explore
it
he
has
a
key
you
know
and
can
come
when
he
likes
for
my
part
i
shall
go
in
to
supper
while
the
oysters
are
hot
do
as
you
like
though
had
we
not
better
wait
you
know
he
is
sure
to
come
bad
as
the
weather
is
on
account
of
that
affair
it
was
late
when
wentworth
notified
him
this
was
the
rejoinder
made
from
within
the
study
in
which
i
recognized
the
voice
of
raymond
clear
and
shrill
well
have
it
as
you
please
if
you
prefer
courtesy
to
comfort
you
shall
be
gratified
but
what
the
use
of
ceremony
with
gregory
he
will
be
here
in
twenty
minutes
bainrothe
but
do
wait
i
shall
have
time
to
sup
with
him
before
i
go
you
know
i
believe
i
will
stay
where
i
am
until
he
comes
and
finish
taking
in
the
poor
well
any
thing
is
better
than
removal
to
the
belfry
and
i
thought
i
heard
a
sigh
a
matter
of
mere
temporary
necessity
you
know
only
she
might
have
frozen
in
the
interval
said
bainrothe
jauntily
as
he
walked
up
the
hall
to
the
door
of
the
which
i
heard
him
open
and
let
fall
against
its
sill
again
it
closed
with
a
spring
and
in
the
next
moment
the
was
also
softly
shut
and
all
was
still
my
resolution
was
promptly
taken
the
folding
leaves
of
the
inner
door
that
which
divided
the
vestibule
from
the
carpeted
entry
against
one
of
which
i
had
been
leaning
i
well
knew
worked
to
and
fro
on
pulleys
which
obeyed
the
drawing
of
a
cord
and
tassel
hanging
at
one
side
and
thus
they
could
readily
be
closed
with
a
touch
by
any
one
standing
in
the
vestibule
as
they
opened
out
into
the
hall
on
which
side
was
the
latch
and
bolt
i
recalled
this
quaint
arrangement
with
a
quickness
born
of
emergency
as
one
that
might
serve
me
now
and
speadily
possessed
myself
of
the
tassel
at
the
extremity
of
the
controlling
cord
thus
armed
and
praying
inwardly
for
strength
and
courage
and
wherewith
to
carry
out
my
scheme
successfully
i
took
my
stand
in
one
of
the
two
niches
just
large
enough
for
the
purpose
in
the
preferring
of
course
that
next
to
the
lock
prepared
to
darken
the
vestibule
at
the
first
approach
of
the
expected
guest
i
was
afraid
to
do
it
before
lest
attention
might
be
called
to
it
from
within
the
house
and
make
my
escape
by
rushing
past
him
ere
he
could
recover
himself
as
he
entered
in
the
gloom
the
hazard
was
extreme
the
result
uncertain
the
effort
almost
foolhardy
it
may
be
thought
but
the
storm
and
darkness
were
in
my
favor
and
i
was
fleet
of
foot
as
were
not
all
of
my
pursuers
as
far
as
i
could
foresee
who
these
might
be
momently
i
grew
cooler
more
determined
more
calm
more
desperate
more
regardless
of
consequences
and
now
the
culmination
of
endeavor
approached
in
the
shape
of
the
sound
of
stamping
feet
upon
the
icy
platform
of
the
steps
which
they
had
softly
ascended
and
the
uncertain
fitting
of
a
key
in
its
dark
socket
the
feeling
for
the
knob
with
fingers
and
finally
the
sudden
and
violent
throwing
forward
and
open
of
the
door
into
the
darkened
vestibule
for
i
had
drawn
the
cord
at
the
first
symptoms
of
gregory
advent
which
yet
took
me
by
surprise
i
had
closed
the
inner
doors
it
is
true
but
paralyzed
with
sudden
terror
i
had
taken
no
advantage
of
the
darkness
thus
evoked
and
as
the
tall
form
of
the
expected
and
expectant
bridegroom
staggered
in
literally
blown
forward
by
the
tempest
with
introverted
umbrella
and
wet
and
streaming
garments
dimly
discerned
in
the
gloom
that
brushed
against
me
as
he
passed
i
continued
to
stand
transfixed
to
stone
in
the
niche
i
still
occupied
the
dream
in
which
la
vigne
had
prophesied
my
failure
flashed
over
me
like
lightning
and
my
knees
trembled
beneath
me
yet
i
still
clung
spasmodically
to
the
cord
i
held
and
with
such
desperate
force
that
when
gregory
pushed
against
the
door
he
believed
it
latched
within
and
so
desisted
from
further
effort
dark
as
erebus
he
muttered
and
on
such
a
night
confound
such
hospitality
i
suppose
i
must
go
back
and
ring
and
in
pursuance
of
this
idea
he
again
suddenly
opened
the
which
swinging
violently
back
as
he
turned
his
face
within
once
more
afforded
me
the
golden
opportunity
so
lately
lost
quick
as
thought
i
dropped
the
cord
i
held
and
in
the
sudden
gust
the
leaves
of
the
inner
door
thus
released
flew
open
and
impelled
my
foe
irresistibly
forward
with
his
flapping
coat
and
hat
he
drifted
into
the
lighted
hall
before
the
driving
blast
and
roused
to
instantaneous
action
i
slid
from
the
niche
i
filled
to
the
icy
platform
without
and
swift
and
silent
as
a
spectre
sped
down
the
sleety
steps
to
the
outward
darkness
i
was
free
a
moment
after
i
heard
the
door
slammed
heavily
after
me
while
i
crouched
by
the
for
concealment
rising
up
i
mutely
blessed
the
friendly
portal
that
made
me
an
outcast
in
the
streets
from
which
the
very
dogs
shrank
terrified
one
moment
one
only
i
paused
as
i
passed
by
my
father
crowned
with
stone
lions
that
glimmered
in
the
gloom
the
force
of
association
and
of
contrast
shook
me
with
emotion
i
could
not
enter
there
my
own
roof
afforded
me
no
shelter
from
the
biting
blast
but
squares
away
with
a
comparative
stranger
i
must
seek
if
i
ever
gained
it
on
that
dreadful
night
a
refuge
from
the
storms
and
sure
protection
from
my
foes
i
moved
rapidly
along
toward
the
tall
that
diffused
a
dim
and
murky
light
from
its
frost
crusted
lantern
at
the
corner
of
the
square
and
before
i
reached
it
i
encountered
the
first
danger
of
my
undertaking
protected
fortunately
by
the
shadow
of
the
high
near
which
i
walked
rapidly
i
met
dinah
so
nearly
face
to
face
that
the
whiff
of
the
pipe
she
was
smoking
was
warm
upon
my
cheek
wrapped
in
her
old
cloth
shawl
and
quilted
hood
she
muttered
as
she
went
and
staggered
too
i
thought
though
here
the
northeast
wind
that
swept
her
along
before
it
might
have
been
at
fault
while
blowing
in
my
face
it
retarded
my
progress
i
passed
her
unchallenged
but
glancing
back
just
as
i
turned
the
corner
i
became
aware
that
she
was
retracing
her
steps
i
fled
rapidly
on
until
i
reached
the
shelter
of
a
friendly
nook
between
two
houses
well
remembered
of
old
when
turning
again
to
gaze
i
saw
her
standing
immovable
as
a
statue
beneath
the
evidently
looking
in
the
direction
i
had
taken
there
seemed
no
way
of
escape
now
save
in
persistent
flight
my
place
of
concealment
might
be
too
readily
detected
by
a
cautious
observer
a
savage
on
the
should
dinah
herself
pursue
me
i
knew
my
speed
would
distance
her
but
that
prompt
pursuit
of
some
kind
was
imminent
i
knew
from
that
moment
my
aim
was
to
reach
the
house
of
pemberton
no
intermediate
one
presenting
itself
as
that
of
an
acquaintance
of
whom
i
could
ask
shelter
and
belief
in
the
truth
of
my
assertions
of
this
house
i
remembered
the
position
with
tolerable
accuracy
it
formed
one
i
knew
of
a
long
block
of
buildings
extending
from
one
street
to
another
and
was
near
the
centre
i
had
been
there
only
on
rare
occasions
when
his
niece
abode
with
him
for
he
dwelt
ordinarily
in
widowed
solitude
although
our
intimacy
was
that
of
relatives
rather
than
of
patient
and
physician
for
this
desired
goal
i
strained
every
nerve
every
muscle
every
faculty
on
that
night
of
bitter
freezing
cold
and
driving
sleet
and
blast
which
seemed
to
proclaim
itself
in
every
howling
gust
the
wind
euroclydon
chapter
xiii
at
first
excitement
and
terror
winged
my
feet
but
even
these
refused
after
i
had
gone
a
few
squares
to
do
their
friendly
office
bareheaded
but
for
a
filmy
veil
soon
thoroughly
drenched
through
barehanded
and
almost
barefooted
for
my
thin
silk
slippers
and
stockings
formed
not
after
my
first
few
steps
the
slightest
impediment
to
wet
or
cold
i
felt
that
i
must
perish
by
the
wayside
the
sleety
storm
drove
sharply
in
my
face
rendered
doubly
sensitive
to
its
rigor
by
long
absence
from
outward
air
my
insufficient
clothing
clung
closely
about
me
freezing
in
every
fold
and
i
glided
rather
than
walked
along
the
icy
pavement
scarcely
lifting
my
stiffened
feet
or
having
power
to
do
so
one
stern
hope
it
almost
seemed
a
forlorn
one
now
possessed
me
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
one
prayer
trembled
on
my
quivering
lips
that
i
might
reach
my
destination
if
only
to
tell
my
story
and
drop
dead
a
moment
after
yet
i
think
in
spite
of
this
resolve
this
prayer
that
had
a
friendly
door
been
opened
on
the
way
an
area
even
emitting
light
and
warmth
i
should
have
instinctively
turned
aside
and
at
any
risk
pleaded
for
shelter
both
from
storm
and
foeman
in
those
days
that
seem
far
back
in
the
march
of
luxury
because
of
the
vast
impetus
of
human
momentum
stores
were
closed
early
and
the
primitive
family
still
existed
which
marked
the
assemblage
of
the
household
around
the
evening
lamp
and
hearth
i
remember
the
closed
inhospitable
look
of
the
houses
past
which
i
sped
the
solid
wooden
shutters
then
universal
which
closed
from
the
wayfarer
every
evidence
of
internal
life
and
the
cold
sheen
of
the
marble
steps
made
visible
by
dim
i
gained
a
not
very
far
as
it
seemed
to
me
from
my
place
of
destination
yet
until
i
glanced
across
the
way
i
was
uncertain
and
but
for
the
friendly
refuge
this
opportunity
presented
i
think
i
must
have
faltered
and
perhaps
fallen
and
frozen
to
death
on
the
to
my
bewildered
and
disordered
brain
aladdin
palace
seemed
suddenly
to
rise
before
me
in
that
wilderness
of
sealed
houses
and
uninhabited
streets
for
as
i
have
said
before
the
very
dogs
had
crept
away
that
night
into
secure
corners
and
not
even
a
pariah
with
his
dingy
blanket
drawn
close
around
him
nodded
and
dozed
by
a
or
slept
on
a
i
crept
across
the
space
that
divided
me
from
this
cynosure
of
warmth
and
luxury
as
a
poor
draggled
moth
might
do
to
bask
in
the
revivifying
light
of
an
astral
lamp
attracted
beyond
my
power
to
resist
to
pause
before
the
resplendent
window
rich
in
green
and
purple
and
amber
rotund
vases
whose
transparent
contents
were
set
forth
and
revealed
by
fiery
jets
of
gas
toward
which
i
feebly
stretched
my
fingers
there
was
a
splendid
vision
also
of
goldfish
in
glass
globes
jars
of
leaden
baskets
of
waxen
fruits
and
flowers
crystal
bottles
containing
rose
and
amber
essences
but
above
all
there
was
light
there
was
heat
with
one
greedy
insatiate
gaze
my
eyes
swept
in
the
details
of
this
mimic
eden
and
in
another
moment
my
hand
turned
the
knob
of
the
door
near
the
window
and
i
found
myself
in
paradise
rest
shelter
heat
these
must
i
have
or
perish
and
but
for
the
timely
refuge
of
this
apothecary
shop
i
might
have
left
this
retrospect
unwritten
i
staggered
to
a
chair
and
seated
myself
unbidden
by
the
almost
stove
and
cowered
above
it
for
a
time
oblivions
of
all
else
then
i
looked
timidly
around
me
the
master
of
this
eden
was
standing
at
the
moment
when
he
first
caught
my
eyes
holding
up
a
bottle
scrutinizingly
between
his
face
and
the
light
one
of
many
of
the
same
sort
that
a
lad
in
a
long
white
apron
was
engaged
in
washing
the
odor
of
the
various
drugs
and
essences
over
which
he
presided
formed
an
aromatic
atmosphere
singularly
suggestive
of
incense
as
did
his
costume
that
of
a
of
the
temple
but
very
soon
discarding
a
cape
or
talma
worn
for
the
protection
of
his
speckless
coat
and
tossing
a
bundle
of
corks
rather
disdainfully
to
his
assistant
the
head
of
the
establishment
came
politely
forward
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
stove
with
clasped
hands
expectantly
you
will
tell
me
your
errand
here
when
you
are
quite
ready
he
said
kindly
do
rest
and
warm
yourself
first
the
stove
has
a
narcotic
tendency
when
one
has
just
come
out
of
cold
like
this
the
thermometer
has
fallen
twenty
degrees
since
noonday
but
that
is
only
half
the
trouble
hem
this
sleet
and
wind
are
beyond
any
former
experience
of
mine
at
this
season
i
heard
the
words
of
the
speaker
as
if
bound
in
a
dreadful
dream
but
they
were
clearly
understood
and
now
i
made
an
effort
at
utterance
but
failed
until
after
repeated
endeavors
to
enunciate
one
word
yet
i
noted
distinctly
and
even
with
a
nice
discrimination
of
scrutiny
the
and
man
portly
and
somewhat
with
his
plump
hands
folded
over
his
vest
who
stood
before
me
looking
pityingly
down
on
my
suffering
face
after
a
time
i
gathered
up
my
forces
sufficiently
to
inquire
being
quite
thawed
and
comforted
by
the
reviving
heat
of
the
apartment
how
far
it
might
be
to
the
house
of
pemberton
who
resided
in
the
block
of
houses
known
as
kendrick
row
on
maple
street
it
is
nearly
a
square
and
a
half
miss
by
street
measurement
just
now
as
on
account
of
changes
this
is
impassable
was
the
prompt
reply
scarcely
half
a
square
by
the
alley
that
runs
from
my
after
a
short
turn
straight
through
to
maple
street
and
if
it
is
only
question
of
a
message
i
can
send
caleb
so
that
you
may
await
the
coming
of
the
doctor
in
comfort
in
this
emporium
he
always
uses
his
gig
for
and
will
no
doubt
be
happy
to
carry
you
home
in
his
wolfskin
thanks
there
is
no
question
of
a
medical
visit
i
have
very
important
business
with
him
i
must
see
him
in
his
own
house
i
will
go
without
further
delay
but
perhaps
lingering
a
moment
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
suffer
caleb
to
show
me
the
short
way
you
spoke
of
i
shall
not
mind
going
through
the
alley
at
all
i
rose
prepared
to
depart
and
glanced
beseechingly
at
caleb
who
laid
down
his
bottle
uncorked
and
folded
his
arms
with
an
approving
knightly
bow
unperceived
by
his
employer
we
have
just
had
a
similar
inquiry
as
to
pemberton
locality
i
mean
said
the
master
of
the
emporium
without
replying
to
my
request
on
the
part
of
a
very
personage
i
might
say
well
got
up
in
the
fur
and
overcoat
line
and
had
you
come
in
a
few
moments
earlier
you
might
have
had
his
escort
or
perhaps
you
are
on
his
track
now
probably
one
of
his
party
hesitatingly
no
well
it
is
a
strange
coincidence
to
say
the
least
very
strange
as
the
doctor
is
so
well
known
hereabouts
as
to
going
out
in
the
storm
again
i
have
my
misgivings
miss
for
you
when
i
look
at
the
flimsiness
of
your
attire
and
its
drenched
condition
i
ca
see
indeed
how
a
lady
like
yourself
ever
held
her
own
against
this
terrific
wind
eolus
seems
to
have
lost
his
bags
but
perhaps
you
had
an
escort
to
the
corner
no
no
no
i
came
quite
alone
oh
for
pity
sake
put
me
on
my
way
and
let
me
go
my
business
is
most
urgent
i
hesitated
my
heart
sank
had
bainrothe
been
before
me
to
spirit
the
doctor
away
by
some
feigned
message
of
need
of
distress
to
which
no
inclemency
of
weather
could
close
that
benevolent
medical
ear
and
did
he
lie
in
wait
for
me
on
the
way
perhaps
i
had
after
all
better
go
alone
i
continued
it
might
be
too
great
an
inconvenience
and
i
moved
toward
the
door
not
if
you
will
accept
my
services
miss
said
caleb
timidly
pushing
away
the
remaining
corks
as
he
spoke
and
glancing
furtively
at
his
master
how
often
must
i
remind
you
caleb
fink
said
the
owner
of
the
emporium
that
your
sphere
is
circumscribed
to
your
duties
attend
to
those
phials
and
drain
them
well
before
you
bottle
the
citrate
of
magnesia
the
last
was
spoiled
by
your
unpardonable
carelessness
i
have
not
forgotten
this
and
again
with
a
deprecatory
look
at
me
caleb
fink
subsided
into
a
nonentity
truly
has
the
great
and
wise
perkins
remarked
that
women
of
america
are
suicidal
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
i
will
give
you
one
of
his
pamphlets
miss
to
take
away
with
you
and
you
will
be
convinced
that
slippers
are
serpents
in
disguise
in
winter
weather
the
wooden
shoes
of
germany
rather
ay
or
even
the
of
france
you
must
not
stir
another
step
in
those
be
seated
pray
and
i
will
not
detain
you
long
while
i
procure
a
substitute
or
protection
for
such
shams
worth
nothing
in
such
siberian
caleb
a
word
with
you
and
he
whispered
to
his
apprentice
who
glided
away
to
return
in
a
trice
with
a
pair
of
overshoes
into
which
benign
boats
he
proceeded
to
thrust
my
unresisting
feet
as
i
stood
leaning
on
the
counter
after
which
a
muffler
was
tied
about
my
ears
and
a
heavy
shawl
thrown
over
my
shoulders
by
the
same
expeditious
hands
could
you
be
always
as
spry
caleb
your
gloves
now
i
shall
need
my
own
and
a
pair
of
stalwart
knitted
mits
were
forthwith
drawn
over
my
passive
hands
in
which
my
fingers
nestled
undivided
and
warm
now
you
look
something
like
going
for
the
doctor
my
overcoat
caleb
gloves
cane
all
hanging
near
the
bed
there
we
are
ready
now
for
old
borealis
himself
if
he
chooses
to
blow
but
i
forget
god
bless
me
you
are
as
pale
as
the
ghost
of
pompey
at
philippi
caleb
the
perkins
elixir
a
glass
now
young
lady
just
take
it
down
at
a
gulp
it
is
the
only
alcoholic
preparation
that
napoleon
bonaparte
burress
ever
suffered
to
pass
his
temperate
lips
father
matthew
does
not
object
to
it
at
all
i
am
told
on
emergencies
it
may
be
had
at
this
repository
very
low
either
by
the
gross
or
dozen
speaking
the
last
words
mechanically
and
he
tendered
me
a
small
glass
of
some
nauseous
bittersweet
and
potent
beverage
that
coursed
through
my
veins
like
liquid
fire
thank
you
it
very
comforting
i
gasped
and
setting
the
glass
down
on
the
counter
i
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
and
burst
into
tears
the
whole
forlornness
of
my
outcast
and
eleemosynary
condition
rushed
over
me
simultaneously
with
the
flood
of
warmth
caused
by
the
perkins
elixir
which
nerved
me
the
next
moment
for
the
encounter
with
the
elements
i
saw
the
kindly
master
of
the
emporium
turn
away
either
to
conceal
his
own
emotion
or
his
observation
of
mine
and
caleb
stood
trembling
and
crying
like
a
girl
before
me
i
had
shrunk
it
may
be
remembered
from
the
description
sabra
gave
me
of
mcdermot
when
i
heard
of
his
red
hair
and
eyes
but
to
this
man
i
yearned
instinctively
for
there
are
moral
differences
discernible
in
the
temperament
greater
than
any
other
and
when
a
man
is
he
usually
usurps
the
womanly
prerogative
and
gushes
but
caleb
sympathy
touched
me
even
more
we
will
go
now
if
you
please
i
said
recovering
myself
by
a
strong
effort
and
napoleon
burress
mutely
tendered
me
his
stout
overcoated
arm
the
short
way
you
mentioned
let
us
go
that
way
if
not
disagreeable
to
you
i
pleaded
oh
no
it
will
be
an
absolute
saving
of
time
to
me
but
i
warn
you
the
alley
is
narrow
and
dark
never
mind
i
prefer
the
short
cut
be
it
what
it
may
time
is
every
thing
to
me
we
passed
through
the
shop
threaded
a
narrow
entry
opened
a
which
gave
upon
a
strip
of
paved
yard
leading
in
turn
to
a
through
which
we
emerged
into
a
dark
and
alley
but
first
the
work
of
unlocking
a
padlock
which
confined
a
chain
had
to
be
effected
and
while
burress
was
thus
unfastening
his
preparatory
to
egress
i
stood
gazing
back
in
the
place
i
had
left
for
the
doors
of
the
long
entry
stood
open
revealing
the
shop
beyond
and
its
illuminated
window
standing
thus
i
saw
as
through
a
vista
and
in
a
perfect
ecstasy
of
terror
the
open
and
two
forms
in
succession
block
its
portals
those
of
gregory
and
bainrothe
would
caleb
send
them
on
our
track
or
would
the
better
part
of
valor
come
to
his
aid
and
save
me
from
their
clutches
a
thought
occurred
to
me
burress
i
said
i
had
retained
his
name
with
its
remarkable
prefix
will
you
not
lock
the
gate
outside
i
can
wait
patiently
until
you
secure
your
premises
and
and
bring
away
the
key
i
had
meant
to
leave
it
here
until
my
return
but
you
are
right
speaking
indulgently
i
suppose
burglars
are
abroad
on
nights
like
this
and
he
quietly
relocked
the
you
are
very
considerate
he
said
dryly
after
we
had
gone
a
few
yards
in
profound
silence
but
had
i
not
better
return
for
a
lantern
oh
not
for
worlds
faster
faster
burress
and
heaven
will
reward
you
never
mind
the
stones
the
snow
the
mud
so
that
we
get
there
first
yes
i
see
where
the
lane
turns
i
see
very
well
in
the
dark
never
fear
only
do
not
delay
i
am
so
glad
you
locked
the
they
can
not
come
that
way
of
whom
are
you
afraid
poor
young
lady
nobody
would
harm
you
i
am
sure
such
a
gentle
tender
thing
as
you
seem
to
be
oh
yes
fiends
are
on
my
track
do
let
them
get
possession
of
me
again
burress
i
am
pursued
yes
faster
faster
but
what
has
startled
you
poor
thing
since
we
left
the
repository
you
seemed
quite
calm
after
the
perkins
elixir
and
those
tears
ah
i
understand
and
he
coughed
several
times
significantly
the
doctor
will
set
all
right
i
suppose
when
i
give
you
into
his
hands
i
am
glad
i
came
with
you
myself
courage
we
shall
soon
be
there
yes
yes
he
is
my
only
hope
i
will
explain
all
when
we
are
safe
with
him
it
is
not
as
you
think
i
have
no
strength
now
do
question
me
further
it
exhausts
me
to
talk
just
drag
me
along
and
silently
and
valiantly
did
he
betake
himself
to
his
task
the
noisome
alley
was
threaded
and
again
we
emerged
into
the
sleety
street
a
few
doors
from
the
corner
of
that
block
in
the
centre
of
which
pemberton
resided
as
we
approached
the
friendly
threshold
the
exact
situation
of
which
was
familiar
to
my
companion
he
pointed
it
out
triumphantly
with
his
stick
we
shall
soon
be
there
he
reiterated
no
need
for
hurry
now
but
as
he
spoke
i
saw
a
carriage
turn
the
corner
we
were
facing
and
again
i
urged
on
my
lagging
escort
to
his
utmost
speed
i
ran
up
the
sleety
steps
in
advance
of
him
and
rang
the
bell
with
convulsive
energy
its
summons
was
answered
promptly
but
not
a
second
too
soon
for
as
the
door
opened
to
admit
me
the
carriage
paused
before
the
door
and
two
men
leaped
from
it
one
of
whom
the
taller
thrusting
burress
aside
rushed
up
the
steps
after
me
with
outstretched
arms
i
had
found
refuge
in
the
vestibule
and
slammed
the
door
in
his
face
closing
as
it
did
with
a
before
he
reached
the
platform
then
turning
to
his
companion
he
fled
down
to
the
street
again
with
the
cry
that
reached
my
ear
distinctly
of
baffled
by
god
on
his
profane
lips
and
the
twain
drove
off
as
rapidly
as
they
had
come
a
moment
later
a
feeble
ring
at
the
door
and
a
voice
from
without
assuring
the
inmates
that
it
was
only
burress
and
conjuring
them
not
to
be
alarmed
caused
him
to
be
admitted
at
once
by
the
and
shown
into
the
same
small
front
study
into
which
she
had
conducted
me
to
await
the
doctor
appearance
what
name
shall
i
give
the
doctor
is
engaged
said
the
lingering
if
one
at
all
merely
let
me
know
when
he
is
ready
to
see
me
i
am
tired
and
cold
and
can
wait
patiently
by
this
good
fire
it
may
be
some
time
miss
would
you
like
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
you
and
this
gentleman
the
doctor
has
just
had
his
supper
and
there
is
a
pint
or
more
left
in
the
urn
thanks
nothing
could
be
more
welcome
and
the
disappeared
that
is
the
way
of
this
house
patients
are
always
entertained
if
in
need
of
refreshment
said
burress
advancing
to
the
chimney
while
he
rubbed
his
hands
in
a
manner
then
expanded
them
before
the
bright
glare
that
filled
every
pore
with
warmth
i
was
tremulous
and
silent
and
half
exhausted
and
he
seemed
to
take
this
in
at
a
friendly
glance
for
he
made
none
of
those
inquiries
that
i
knew
were
burning
on
his
inquisitive
lips
but
after
a
few
moments
of
further
enjoyment
before
the
grate
and
having
duly
turned
himself
as
on
a
spit
so
as
to
absorb
every
ray
of
heat
possible
he
betook
himself
to
an
and
a
book
near
the
on
a
corner
table
the
soft
rustling
of
the
turning
leaves
of
which
had
a
most
soothing
effect
on
my
nerves
i
shall
only
stay
a
few
minutes
he
said
apologetically
i
wish
however
to
see
you
safe
in
pemberton
hands
before
i
leave
you
as
a
sort
of
duty
you
know
you
being
a
charge
of
mine
and
should
you
need
further
escort
oh
thank
you
kindly
you
have
surely
had
enough
trouble
on
my
account
already
not
a
particle
only
a
pleasure
miss
but
the
push
i
got
from
your
pursuer
upset
me
on
the
pavement
and
made
sparks
fly
out
of
my
eyes
and
before
i
could
gather
myself
up
they
were
back
again
in
the
carriage
and
off
you
will
have
to
give
me
the
man
name
miss
you
will
indeed
on
my
own
account
when
all
your
fatigue
and
fright
are
over
such
favors
are
generally
returned
by
me
with
compound
interest
oh
be
thankful
you
have
not
a
compound
fracture
burress
and
let
the
fellow
go
he
is
beneath
contempt
but
i
shall
not
be
satisfied
until
pemberton
tells
me
himself
that
you
are
uninjured
a
lump
as
big
as
a
potato
that
all
miss
not
worth
minding
i
assure
you
and
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
occipital
region
an
application
before
retiring
to
bed
of
blood
and
life
regenerator
will
make
all
right
again
an
astonishing
remedy
miss
which
no
family
should
be
without
and
which
may
be
obtained
cheaply
by
the
gross
or
dozen
at
my
emporium
you
have
heard
of
hercules
prang
these
were
the
last
words
i
heard
distinctly
from
the
lips
of
napoleon
burress
nor
were
they
answered
even
by
the
brief
never
which
might
have
proclaimed
my
ignorance
of
the
very
existence
of
that
of
charlatanry
who
for
the
benefit
of
suffering
mankind
had
condescended
to
compel
his
genius
into
the
shape
of
a
revivifying
balsam
i
had
with
the
aid
of
the
divested
myself
of
my
wet
overshoes
and
wrappings
before
the
advent
of
my
companion
and
had
already
ensconced
myself
in
a
deep
spanish
chair
that
stood
invitingly
and
with
extended
arms
in
one
corner
of
the
fireplace
when
he
advanced
to
place
himself
on
the
rug
for
a
general
roasting
it
was
precisely
twenty
minutes
past
ten
burress
told
me
later
when
he
detected
by
stealing
on
tiptoe
to
my
chair
and
bending
above
me
that
i
was
sound
asleep
and
the
mantel
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
eleven
when
i
awoke
in
one
corner
of
the
room
sat
a
stern
statue
of
silence
in
the
shape
of
burress
watching
my
repose
and
from
the
adjoining
office
came
the
murmur
of
voices
that
proved
that
the
long
interview
between
pemberton
and
his
patient
was
still
in
progress
at
this
moment
one
of
the
of
the
small
that
formed
a
communication
between
the
study
and
office
of
the
good
physician
swung
itself
gently
on
its
noiseless
hinges
into
the
position
distinguished
in
description
as
slightly
ajar
and
thus
remained
fixed
after
a
fashion
that
spiritual
mediums
might
have
been
able
to
account
for
on
supernatural
principles
the
low
murmur
of
voices
then
readily
resolved
itself
into
shaped
words
and
sentences
and
but
for
my
deep
languor
and
the
delightful
sense
of
security
that
possessed
me
i
should
have
risen
and
closed
the
obliging
door
to
shut
out
unintentional
communications
as
it
was
i
lingered
and
listened
as
one
might
do
to
the
dash
of
waves
or
the
rustling
of
branches
until
suddenly
the
tones
and
meaning
of
the
principal
interlocutor
caused
me
to
rise
to
my
loftiest
sitting
posture
and
clasp
the
arms
of
the
chair
i
occupied
while
the
strained
ear
of
attention
drank
in
every
syllable
of
the
remainder
of
the
narrative
evidently
drawing
near
its
close
the
low
monotony
of
a
continued
discourse
pervaded
the
voice
the
manner
of
the
speaker
the
thread
of
whose
story
was
no
longer
interrupted
as
before
by
the
comments
or
questions
of
his
companion
intent
upon
the
vital
interest
of
the
tale
so
i
turned
back
at
panama
said
the
probably
of
a
series
of
adventures
and
abandoned
my
project
altogether
the
man
spoke
with
an
air
and
tone
of
truth
the
sketch
was
unmistakably
hers
the
whole
thing
was
full
of
so
to
speak
and
bore
me
completely
off
my
feet
the
initials
beneath
the
sketch
of
christian
garth
were
identical
with
her
own
he
referred
me
to
captain
van
dorne
for
confirmation
of
the
saving
of
the
few
remaining
passengers
on
the
raft
and
her
presence
in
the
ship
latona
together
with
that
of
the
child
and
negress
i
have
seen
captain
van
dorne
and
he
admits
the
part
he
played
on
the
representation
of
bainrothe
and
through
the
evidence
of
a
newspaper
advertisement
of
the
previous
autumn
which
had
met
his
eye
to
satisfy
the
puerile
scruples
of
this
really
good
but
ignorant
man
going
no
deeper
than
the
surface
in
his
code
of
morals
they
were
obliged
to
tear
out
the
record
of
their
names
and
take
refuge
temporarily
in
the
before
he
would
swear
to
miriam
in
her
that
bainrothe
was
not
on
board
as
to
the
which
would
have
gone
into
effect
and
which
the
wretch
managed
to
defeat
by
requiring
an
error
to
be
corrected
in
the
writ
that
no
guiltless
man
would
have
observed
i
fear
sometimes
it
will
prove
ineffectual
if
we
wait
for
the
morrow
my
plan
was
to
go
at
midnight
with
a
party
of
my
friends
to
the
house
of
this
miscreant
and
take
the
law
in
my
own
hands
but
in
this
i
could
not
stir
for
the
reasons
i
have
given
you
besides
that
it
was
risking
too
much
her
safety
and
reputation
she
can
not
be
secretly
removed
of
course
for
we
have
a
detective
in
the
house
able
and
strong
besides
the
old
negress
both
of
whom
have
played
you
false
i
interrupted
rising
impetuously
and
throwing
back
the
loose
leaf
of
the
door
and
i
am
here
to
tell
you
this
o
friends
have
you
forgotten
me
and
rushing
forward
i
threw
an
arm
around
each
of
those
dear
necks
weeping
alternately
on
the
shoulder
of
one
and
the
other
of
the
two
men
i
loved
best
in
the
world
and
who
for
some
moments
sat
silent
and
amazed
then
wentworth
rose
mutely
and
clasped
me
to
his
breast
and
silence
prevailed
between
us
it
comprehended
all
i
think
when
we
meet
again
in
heaven
after
that
severance
which
is
inevitable
to
those
who
wear
a
mortal
shape
we
may
feel
as
we
did
then
but
never
before
the
rapture
the
relief
the
spiritual
ecstasy
surmounting
as
on
wings
of
fire
pain
fatigue
suspense
anguish
of
mind
and
body
were
in
themselves
lessons
of
immortality
beyond
any
that
book
or
sage
has
issued
from
midnight
vigil
or
earthly
tabernacle
not
until
a
new
order
of
things
is
established
and
we
have
done
with
tribulation
tears
and
death
shall
we
again
know
such
sensations
nor
is
it
indeed
quite
certain
that
human
heart
and
brain
could
twice
sustain
them
here
below
chapter
xiv
reaction
came
at
last
life
is
full
of
bathos
as
well
as
pathos
an
hour
later
we
four
companions
in
the
rejoicing
over
this
redemption
if
chiefly
strangers
before
were
partaking
cheerfully
together
of
hot
coffee
and
oysters
the
services
of
jessup
had
been
called
in
the
doctor
excellent
old
quaker
and
amid
many
thous
and
thees
she
had
served
us
a
capital
and
expeditious
supper
no
one
enjoyed
the
festive
occasion
more
than
burress
who
on
the
point
of
stealing
lightly
away
after
witnessing
from
the
front
study
the
scene
of
recognition
and
meeting
had
been
arrested
on
the
threshold
by
pemberton
himself
either
to
allow
a
full
explanation
between
two
lovers
or
to
conceal
his
own
emotion
and
get
back
his
customary
calm
our
dear
doctor
had
seen
fit
to
step
into
the
for
a
few
minutes
and
he
checked
burress
with
his
hand
on
the
with
some
very
natural
questions
as
to
the
mode
and
time
of
our
meeting
and
ended
by
requiring
his
presence
at
the
slight
collation
he
ordered
at
once
the
part
the
worthy
apothecary
had
played
in
my
closing
adventure
the
certainty
that
to
his
zeal
and
promptness
i
owed
my
immunity
from
further
captivity
for
had
i
walked
around
the
square
in
the
usual
way
the
men
at
watch
from
the
must
have
espied
and
seized
me
or
had
we
loitered
in
the
alley
and
arrived
a
moment
later
at
the
central
house
of
kendrick
row
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
would
have
been
there
to
await
my
arrival
nor
could
burress
have
saved
me
from
their
clutches
the
whole
thing
seemed
especially
providential
but
as
the
efficient
medium
of
each
mercy
napoleon
burress
did
indeed
seem
to
all
present
crowned
with
a
perfect
nimbus
of
glory
pemberton
led
him
back
to
my
presence
with
his
arm
encircling
his
shoulder
captain
wentworth
shook
his
hand
mutely
but
long
with
his
eyes
dimmed
with
tears
and
words
that
found
imperfect
utterance
at
last
compelling
him
to
strange
silence
i
thank
you
i
bless
you
he
said
at
last
i
do
not
hope
to
be
able
to
return
such
services
but
what
i
command
and
i
to
think
that
she
was
crazy
all
the
time
escaped
from
the
great
asylum
a
mile
away
sweetest
creature
too
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
and
caleb
thought
so
too
the
speaker
brushed
a
briny
drop
or
two
from
his
eyes
with
the
back
of
his
hand
as
he
spoke
then
smiling
archly
asked
can
you
forgive
me
miss
for
belying
you
so
even
in
thought
you
see
i
have
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
now
but
such
a
pity
forgive
you
and
i
advanced
toward
him
and
put
both
my
hands
in
one
of
his
large
white
extremities
and
before
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
i
had
stooped
over
and
kissed
it
and
was
bathing
it
with
my
tears
o
miss
this
is
too
much
it
is
indeed
said
napoleon
blushing
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
withdrawing
his
hand
with
a
air
you
nonplus
me
completely
you
see
she
was
too
much
overcome
burress
to
speak
otherwise
than
this
said
wentworth
drawing
me
to
his
bosom
you
must
honor
this
expression
of
feeling
as
i
do
o
sir
it
is
the
greatest
honor
i
ever
received
in
my
life
and
she
poor
thing
like
penelope
tangled
up
in
a
web
so
long
and
free
at
last
well
it
is
a
great
joy
to
me
to
think
i
helped
a
little
to
cut
the
ropes
helped
why
i
owe
every
thing
to
you
listen
and
then
as
briefly
as
i
could
i
recounted
the
trials
in
store
for
me
that
very
night
the
compulsory
marriage
or
the
removal
to
the
one
or
the
other
inevitable
and
either
of
which
must
have
made
the
proposed
rescue
of
the
following
day
on
the
part
of
captain
wentworth
and
his
friends
in
one
sense
or
the
other
unavailing
as
the
wife
of
gregory
or
as
the
prisoner
of
the
turret
i
should
in
one
case
have
been
morally
and
in
the
other
physically
dead
or
lost
forever
mutely
and
tearfully
even
was
my
skill
in
setting
forth
the
magnitude
of
the
wrong
from
which
burress
had
been
instrumental
in
saving
me
acknowledged
by
my
audience
not
excepting
jenny
the
who
arrested
on
the
threshold
stood
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
neat
cotton
apron
in
token
of
sympathy
caleb
will
be
wondering
what
has
become
of
me
and
tired
out
of
watching
if
i
do
go
home
at
once
said
burress
after
his
emotion
had
subsided
and
accepting
gracefully
the
civic
crown
with
which
he
had
been
metaphorically
rewarded
mine
was
in
store
but
how
could
he
dream
of
this
a
statue
of
the
greek
slave
a
copy
made
by
a
soon
adorned
his
window
and
his
bride
wore
pearls
of
price
the
joint
gift
of
miriam
and
wardour
wentworth
a
twelvemonth
later
when
a
mistress
of
the
emporium
was
brought
home
much
to
the
solace
of
caleb
who
was
remembered
by
us
also
let
me
not
forget
to
add
truly
kind
and
benevolent
as
he
was
napoleon
burress
had
a
despotic
manner
which
relaxed
beneath
the
genial
smile
of
marian
march
i
must
go
indeed
my
dear
sir
to
pemberton
but
this
night
will
be
memorable
in
my
annals
god
bless
you
all
farewell
afraid
of
an
encounter
not
i
like
horatio
cockleshell
of
old
i
learned
to
carry
pistols
constantly
about
me
when
i
had
to
pass
the
bridge
every
night
as
a
youngster
my
parents
lived
in
hamilton
village
i
still
keep
up
the
custom
and
therefore
pay
my
fine
yearly
to
the
council
when
at
last
we
separated
the
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
one
and
i
went
to
a
clean
and
quiet
chamber
above
the
little
study
where
a
bright
fire
was
burning
but
whence
the
smell
of
lavender
which
always
accompanies
the
fresh
sheets
of
quakerhood
still
prevailed
with
a
fragrance
the
attentive
disrobed
me
and
bathed
my
chilled
and
frosted
feet
and
swollen
hands
in
water
tempered
with
alcohol
then
arraying
me
in
a
and
snowy
cotton
gown
the
property
of
good
jessup
placed
me
in
the
soft
nest
prepared
for
sojourners
beneath
that
homely
but
hospitable
roof
i
hope
thee
is
comfortable
miriam
monfort
said
jessup
after
i
was
ensconced
in
bed
why
thy
face
is
the
same
after
all
that
i
remember
when
thou
wert
a
very
little
girl
and
used
to
walk
out
with
austin
she
is
well
i
hope
settling
the
i
can
not
tell
you
jessup
i
must
rather
ask
such
questions
of
you
when
did
you
see
her
last
and
mabel
do
you
know
my
little
sister
oh
yes
i
know
her
perfectly
well
by
sight
let
me
see
it
was
sabbath
before
last
that
just
as
i
was
coming
out
of
friends
i
saw
mabel
monfort
a
pretty
maiden
truly
walking
with
her
i
think
and
a
tall
and
stately
gentleman
but
austin
i
have
not
seen
since
last
and
then
only
in
passing
she
seemed
well
but
wore
a
troubled
face
yes
yes
she
was
troubled
no
doubt
things
were
so
altered
and
if
her
heart
had
not
turned
to
stone
she
must
have
thought
of
me
sometimes
regretfully
but
all
bids
fair
now
jessup
both
for
me
and
her
and
for
mabel
for
the
rest
let
them
go
they
are
fiends
thee
has
a
very
flushed
and
hot
cheek
miriam
now
that
i
see
thee
closely
and
touch
thy
face
doing
so
lightly
with
the
back
of
her
hand
as
she
spoke
a
bowl
of
would
no
doubt
be
of
service
to
thee
shall
i
oh
no
jessup
i
never
could
drink
that
wise
stuff
in
the
world
i
have
just
had
a
good
supper
and
am
excited
that
is
all
jenny
will
tell
you
what
she
overheard
concerning
my
escape
of
and
that
will
account
for
all
then
miriam
may
the
lord
have
thee
in
his
care
this
night
and
she
withdrew
followed
by
jenny
eager
no
doubt
to
commence
the
recital
of
my
adventure
or
to
hear
what
more
captain
wentworth
and
pemberton
had
to
say
on
the
subject
it
was
nearly
daylight
when
they
parted
one
to
snatch
a
few
hours
of
needful
slumber
before
setting
out
on
his
professional
tour
the
other
to
go
at
once
to
the
officers
of
justice
and
at
the
very
earliest
hour
possible
obtain
the
authority
to
arrest
the
brace
of
still
protected
by
the
shadows
of
the
dawn
for
justice
has
its
time
of
sleeping
and
waking
in
large
cities
and
will
not
be
denied
its
meals
its
hours
of
rest
and
even
recreation
so
it
was
seven
in
the
cold
november
morning
before
the
proper
ceremonials
could
be
accomplished
which
placed
it
in
the
power
of
wentworth
to
arraign
basil
bainrothe
and
luke
gregory
he
occupied
one
seat
in
the
which
was
otherwise
filled
by
the
officers
of
the
law
but
when
he
rang
a
sonorous
peal
on
the
portal
bell
of
bainrothe
residence
it
was
unanswered
and
though
the
house
had
been
watched
since
daylight
by
an
armed
police
force
who
had
no
connection
with
mcdermot
it
was
found
when
an
entrance
had
been
effected
that
the
only
inhabitants
of
the
mansion
were
a
sick
woman
an
old
negress
and
a
child
apparently
from
its
puny
size
about
a
twelvemonth
old
the
woman
could
not
be
aroused
from
the
coma
in
which
she
seemed
to
have
fallen
either
as
a
crisis
of
her
disease
or
a
precursor
of
death
medical
opinion
was
divided
until
suddenly
about
noon
she
waked
perfectly
clear
in
mind
and
comfortable
in
body
and
called
loudly
for
nourishment
i
had
slept
profoundly
until
that
hour
and
my
first
thought
in
waking
was
of
clayton
and
her
probable
condition
then
came
the
concentrated
effort
necessary
for
her
release
and
she
too
awoke
as
i
have
shown
to
consciousness
and
physical
ease
her
surprise
her
indignation
at
being
thus
deserted
surpassed
even
her
disappointment
at
my
escape
and
her
involuntary
somnolency
was
a
theme
of
and
marvel
both
but
all
yielded
in
turn
to
terror
when
she
found
herself
under
arrest
in
her
own
chamber
in
company
with
her
sabra
the
child
was
brought
to
me
at
my
earnest
request
and
during
the
few
days
of
my
sojourn
under
pemberton
roof
managed
to
make
friends
of
all
around
him
his
deformity
soon
became
a
matter
of
interest
and
medical
examination
and
it
was
decided
that
it
was
not
beyond
the
reach
of
surgical
skill
the
process
would
be
very
gradual
pemberton
thought
of
straightening
the
spinal
curvature
but
should
the
health
of
the
child
prove
good
after
his
tardy
and
difficult
dentition
much
might
be
hoped
from
the
aid
of
nature
herself
this
was
joyous
intelligence
to
me
the
noble
soul
of
ernie
should
still
wear
a
fitting
frame
and
the
stature
of
his
kind
be
accorded
to
him
the
picaninny
wicked
old
sabra
had
gloated
on
as
a
dainty
morsel
on
the
raft
might
live
to
put
fate
itself
to
shame
for
had
i
not
marveled
that
his
mother
even
should
care
to
preserve
a
thing
so
frail
and
wretched
when
we
sat
together
on
the
burning
ship
and
later
had
i
not
pondered
over
the
wisdom
of
his
preservation
who
then
shall
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
divine
intention
claude
bainrothe
had
been
arrested
but
after
close
and
thorough
examination
was
dismissed
as
irresponsible
for
and
ignorant
of
his
father
acts
and
designs
a
sentence
afterward
revoked
as
far
as
public
opinion
was
concerned
evelyn
mabel
and
austin
were
of
course
beyond
suspicion
the
last
two
deservedly
so
and
if
indeed
evelyn
had
been
guilty
of
coÃ¶peration
i
knew
it
had
been
through
the
force
of
circumstances
alone
too
potent
for
her
egotism
and
vanity
she
never
wished
to
destroy
only
to
govern
me
and
make
my
being
and
interests
subordinate
to
her
own
austin
and
mabel
received
me
with
earnest
joy
and
evelyn
even
manifested
a
decent
sense
of
sisterly
gratulation
i
never
saw
claude
bainrothe
nor
entered
my
father
house
until
after
he
had
left
it
and
forever
accompanied
not
by
his
wife
who
lingered
behind
in
distress
and
wretched
dependence
most
bitter
to
a
spirit
like
hers
neither
loving
to
give
or
receive
favors
for
gathering
up
all
of
his
own
and
his
father
valuables
and
drawing
from
the
bank
every
dollar
he
could
command
this
worthy
son
of
an
unprincipled
sire
fled
to
join
his
parent
with
his
minion
ada
greene
evelyn
had
been
for
some
time
sensible
of
his
infatuation
and
striven
vainly
to
combat
it
by
every
means
in
her
power
forbearance
having
been
her
first
alternative
vivid
reproach
her
last
but
experiments
had
failed
the
first
only
fostered
guilt
beneath
her
own
roof
the
last
urged
it
to
its
consummation
still
young
and
beautiful
she
was
deserted
by
the
only
man
she
had
ever
loved
the
being
for
whom
she
had
ruthlessly
sacrificed
the
welfare
of
her
sisters
and
every
sentiment
of
honor
to
whom
she
had
given
up
her
liberty
to
pander
to
his
and
his
father
ignominy
and
her
home
to
their
desecration
in
her
great
grief
she
retired
to
the
solitude
of
her
own
chamber
and
refused
to
see
any
face
save
that
of
austin
who
from
this
period
became
her
sole
attendant
even
after
time
had
somewhat
ameliorated
the
first
agony
incident
to
her
condition
for
there
came
to
her
another
phase
of
being
which
made
this
attendance
no
less
a
necessity
than
her
present
form
of
bitter
and
helpless
grief
hope
revived
but
in
a
form
that
promised
no
fruition
and
which
later
will
be
made
plainer
to
the
reader
just
now
i
must
continue
my
old
martin
was
dead
of
paralysis
after
praying
vainly
to
be
spared
to
see
his
master
child
return
and
take
possession
of
her
own
for
he
had
never
believed
in
my
suicide
an
idea
that
bainrothe
had
taken
pains
to
propagate
nor
did
he
lend
any
faith
to
my
demise
knowing
what
he
did
he
believed
that
i
had
gone
to
england
to
get
assistance
from
my
mother
relatives
and
austin
had
shared
his
opinion
she
had
nursed
him
to
the
last
faithfully
and
evelyn
had
been
tolerant
of
his
presence
this
at
least
was
a
consolation
sabra
and
clayton
were
not
prosecuted
and
i
did
perhaps
the
most
inexorable
act
of
my
life
when
i
refused
to
see
either
of
them
again
or
assist
them
to
more
than
a
mere
subsistence
until
health
could
be
restored
to
the
one
and
her
owners
written
to
in
order
that
the
other
might
be
reclaimed
to
bondage
in
which
condition
alone
she
and
such
as
she
can
be
restrained
from
wrongdoing
for
there
are
devils
on
the
earth
says
swedenborg
as
well
as
angels
and
they
both
wear
human
guise
but
by
this
may
we
know
them
that
no
mortal
ties
bind
them
no
sphere
confines
them
they
walk
abroad
the
one
solely
to
evil
for
its
own
sake
the
other
to
universal
good
for
the
father
such
as
these
die
not
but
are
translated
the
one
to
hell
the
other
to
heaven
do
we
not
right
then
to
confine
and
enslave
devils
while
they
abide
with
us
or
if
we
can
to
destroy
them
utterly
and
if
we
discern
them
shall
we
not
adore
god
angels
these
dwell
not
long
among
us
and
their
eyes
are
fixed
always
with
a
far
pure
yearning
for
some
sphere
in
which
we
have
no
part
we
feel
this
in
our
daily
intercourse
with
them
for
angels
like
these
dwell
often
in
the
lowliest
form
about
us
and
our
common
contact
with
them
thrills
and
awes
us
though
we
scarcely
realize
that
it
is
from
them
we
have
these
sensations
or
what
renders
them
so
far
though
near
at
hand
little
children
submissive
slaves
sad
women
unresisting
men
patient
physicians
great
patriots
persistent
preachers
martyr
poets
all
these
forms
and
phases
in
turn
do
our
associate
angels
enter
into
and
inform
but
ever
the
sign
is
there
they
are
not
ours
among
us
but
not
of
us
set
apart
here
for
a
season
be
it
longer
or
shorter
ready
at
any
time
to
spread
their
wings
my
sister
was
of
these
i
did
not
recognize
this
truth
in
the
time
of
my
great
sorrow
when
the
parting
plumes
had
not
revealed
themselves
to
my
undiscerning
eyes
a
mighty
touchstone
has
been
applied
to
these
earthly
orbs
since
then
and
the
power
to
discriminate
has
been
given
to
my
soul
as
gregory
and
sabra
were
devils
i
verily
believe
so
was
mabel
one
of
angels
who
shall
gainsay
me
who
knows
more
than
i
on
this
subtle
subject
not
the
wisest
theologian
that
lives
and
breathes
this
earthly
air
only
those
who
never
speak
to
enlighten
us
and
who
have
passed
into
infinite
light
and
knowledge
through
the
portals
of
the
grave
when
i
knelt
beside
wardour
wentworth
in
the
old
church
of
chimes
a
fortnight
after
my
emancipation
from
the
thraldom
of
demons
i
acquired
with
this
new
allegiance
of
mine
a
more
christian
and
forbearing
spirit
than
had
ever
before
possessed
me
but
the
pearl
of
great
price
came
not
yet
into
the
deeps
of
sorrow
was
my
soul
first
compelled
to
enter
a
diver
in
the
great
ocean
whence
alone
all
such
precious
pearls
are
borne
notice
had
been
given
to
claude
bainrothe
to
evacuate
my
premises
before
my
return
from
the
brief
which
comprised
business
as
well
as
recreation
captain
wentworth
took
me
with
him
to
richmond
and
to
washington
to
both
of
which
places
his
affairs
led
him
in
the
last
i
had
the
pleasure
of
grasping
old
hickory
by
his
honest
hand
he
was
my
husband
patron
and
benefactor
and
as
such
alone
entitled
to
my
regard
but
there
was
more
as
patriot
soldier
gentleman
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
i
have
not
seen
his
peer
it
was
a
great
delight
to
me
in
spite
of
the
shadow
evelyn
grief
threw
over
our
threshold
to
stand
once
more
as
mistress
in
my
house
even
in
the
wreck
of
fortune
and
control
the
education
and
destiny
of
my
young
sister
little
ernie
too
had
his
place
in
the
household
as
son
by
adoption
and
grew
daily
stronger
and
more
vigorous
in
our
sight
the
thoughtful
loving
and
reticent
child
heralding
the
man
of
power
affection
and
principle
that
he
has
become
the
employment
of
my
husband
lay
near
the
city
of
my
nativity
he
was
occupied
in
making
the
great
railroad
through
jersey
that
was
the
pioneer
of
engineering
progress
and
a
mighty
link
between
two
kindred
states
he
was
in
this
way
though
often
absent
never
for
any
length
of
time
and
his
return
was
always
a
fresh
source
of
joy
to
his
household
mabel
worshiped
him
ernie
silently
revered
evelyn
with
all
of
her
growing
peculiarities
acknowledged
he
had
merit
and
austin
regarded
him
with
mingled
awe
and
affection
for
to
her
he
was
singularly
kind
and
affectionate
to
grow
old
in
servitude
he
would
say
what
sadder
fate
can
befall
any
being
or
more
entitle
him
or
her
to
forbearance
and
respect
what
hardships
does
this
condition
not
impose
and
this
is
a
field
for
universal
charity
which
costs
not
much
only
a
little
patience
and
a
few
kind
words
and
smiles
ours
was
a
happy
household
no
cloud
rested
upon
it
save
for
a
few
brief
days
of
illness
or
discomfort
until
the
great
blow
fell
in
her
seventeenth
year
and
on
the
eve
of
her
marriage
with
norman
stansbury
again
our
neighbor
at
intervals
when
he
came
to
visit
his
relatives
a
man
of
noble
qualities
and
singularly
devoted
to
my
sister
mabel
died
suddenly
of
some
secret
disease
of
the
heart
which
had
simulated
radiant
health
and
bloom
i
had
sometimes
observed
with
anxiety
a
slight
shortness
of
breath
a
gasping
after
unusual
exercise
and
called
the
attention
of
physicians
to
this
state
of
things
in
my
sister
who
regarded
it
merely
as
a
nervous
symptom
and
this
was
all
to
indicate
that
the
fell
destroyer
was
silently
at
work
she
had
just
laid
a
bunch
of
white
roses
on
her
toilet
and
crossed
the
chamber
for
water
to
place
them
in
when
she
called
my
name
in
a
strange
excited
way
that
brought
me
speedily
to
her
side
from
the
adjoining
room
she
was
lying
white
and
speechless
on
her
bed
beside
which
the
crystal
goblet
lay
in
fragments
the
waters
of
her
own
existence
had
flowed
forth
with
those
prepared
for
her
flowers
and
before
assistance
could
be
summoned
she
expired
peacefully
in
my
arms
without
a
struggle
she
had
inherited
her
mother
malady
the
anguish
and
disappointment
of
the
lover
and
my
own
despair
may
be
better
imagined
than
portrayed
my
baby
died
a
few
weeks
later
partly
i
think
from
the
effect
of
my
own
condition
on
her
frail
organization
and
the
hope
of
years
was
blighted
in
this
fragile
blossom
the
first
that
had
blessed
our
union
the
little
constance
slumbered
by
mabel
side
and
a
slip
from
that
bunch
of
white
roses
the
last
my
sister
had
gathered
shadows
the
marbles
that
guard
both
of
those
yet
not
neglected
graves
thus
death
at
last
entered
our
happy
household
a
great
shadow
fell
over
me
which
i
vainly
strove
to
dispel
with
all
the
effort
of
my
reason
and
my
will
physicians
remembering
my
inscrutable
melancholy
a
part
of
that
mysterious
malady
that
consumed
her
life
whispered
their
warnings
in
my
husband
ears
and
he
resolved
with
that
energy
which
belongs
to
men
of
his
nature
to
lay
the
axe
at
once
to
the
root
of
this
evil
in
the
only
way
that
presented
itself
to
his
mind
as
possible
of
accomplishment
at
first
i
resisted
faintly
the
coincidence
of
his
will
which
he
knew
was
sure
to
come
sooner
or
later
and
to
the
very
last
it
was
agony
unspeakable
to
me
to
think
that
my
father
house
should
pass
into
the
hands
of
strangers
and
that
the
place
that
knew
me
should
know
me
no
more
very
resolutely
and
calmly
did
wardour
endure
and
stem
my
opposition
swift
and
strong
as
the
current
of
my
will
flowed
naturally
he
was
ever
its
master
as
the
stone
dam
can
stay
and
lull
the
fiercest
rivers
he
persisted
knowing
well
what
was
at
stake
and
to
my
surprise
pemberton
and
gerald
stansbury
cooperated
with
his
decision
nor
did
lodore
oppose
it
though
losing
thereby
one
of
his
most
liberal
parishioners
a
great
struggle
was
going
on
in
my
heart
just
then
that
i
think
would
have
perished
in
darkness
had
i
not
found
myself
free
and
emancipated
from
all
fetters
of
custom
and
observance
by
our
change
of
residence
from
the
shallow
streams
of
conventional
christianity
moving
with
tardy
current
and
full
of
shoals
and
sandbanks
i
was
drifting
down
slowly
but
surely
with
that
great
ocean
of
deep
and
unsounded
religion
to
which
all
profound
natures
that
have
suffered
do
i
believe
if
left
to
themselves
inevitably
tend
in
this
new
land
of
promise
the
golden
california
lying
like
a
bride
by
the
side
of
her
bridegroom
the
great
pacific
ocean
and
shut
away
by
deserts
and
mountains
from
all
old
conventional
cliques
and
prejudices
of
our
eastern
cities
my
soul
took
wing
what
poetry
was
in
me
found
its
outlet
what
religious
capacity
god
had
endued
me
with
went
forth
from
the
clash
of
cymbals
and
the
sound
of
the
sackbut
that
ever
had
reminded
me
in
all
seasons
of
sorrow
or
even
of
joyous
excitement
that
i
was
one
of
an
ancient
people
astray
in
foreign
pastures
went
forth
even
as
the
compromise
was
made
at
first
by
christ
and
his
apostles
with
the
magnificent
but
soulless
worship
of
the
jews
to
merge
these
sounds
of
ancient
rite
and
form
in
the
deep
roll
of
the
organ
that
fills
the
churches
where
the
host
is
present
i
needed
this
abiding
miracle
to
stay
my
faith
to
give
it
a
new
rapture
never
experienced
before
to
sustain
me
in
my
sorrow
in
the
presence
of
the
holy
eucharist
in
the
sweet
belief
that
saints
communed
with
me
and
that
the
mother
of
god
who
like
me
had
wept
and
suffered
interceded
for
me
at
the
throne
of
christ
i
regained
the
vitality
that
seemed
gone
forever
there
is
no
cup
like
this
for
the
lips
of
the
parched
and
weary
wayfarer
none
chapter
xv
let
me
go
back
a
little
in
this
retrospect
into
which
i
am
compelling
into
a
small
space
much
that
would
take
time
in
the
telling
as
a
necessary
retrenchment
for
too
much
affluence
of
description
in
the
beginning
the
mind
of
the
narrator
like
the
stone
descending
the
shaft
gathers
accelerated
velocity
with
its
momentum
toward
the
last
and
so
expends
itself
in
a
more
brief
and
sententious
manner
than
in
the
commencement
it
should
be
also
but
rarely
is
more
powerful
and
more
condensed
as
it
nears
its
why
these
things
do
go
more
uniformly
together
as
according
to
popular
opinion
they
invariably
must
is
better
understood
by
the
artist
than
his
readers
details
are
requisite
to
fill
up
a
mental
picture
and
impress
it
on
the
memory
and
though
brevity
is
certainly
the
soul
of
wit
it
can
not
be
said
to
be
infallible
in
enforcing
description
to
do
its
duty
that
of
painting
a
panoramic
picture
on
the
brain
life
is
full
of
and
so
is
fiction
if
indeed
it
resembles
life
such
as
we
know
it
or
such
as
it
might
be
the
art
of
verisimilitude
is
found
alone
in
detail
let
me
go
back
then
for
a
brief
summary
of
some
of
the
principal
events
and
personages
of
monfort
hall
and
beauseincourt
the
earlier
portions
of
this
retrospect
i
will
begin
with
the
la
vignes
george
gaston
in
one
of
the
brief
pauses
of
his
stormy
political
career
wooed
and
married
margaret
la
vigne
the
year
before
her
mother
espoused
in
second
nuptials
her
early
lover
the
brother
of
that
saintly
minister
who
came
to
her
rescue
in
the
first
days
of
her
widowhood
and
in
this
marriage
she
has
been
happy
and
prosperous
they
continue
to
reside
under
the
same
roof
and
bellevue
awaits
its
master
it
will
be
empty
i
think
if
i
understand
george
character
so
long
as
major
favraud
is
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
continent
of
europe
and
held
for
his
especial
benefit
and
return
in
readiness
vernon
and
his
sweet
wife
marion
spent
the
first
season
of
their
happy
married
life
under
my
and
are
now
our
nearest
neighbors
in
our
new
land
of
sojourn
a
slender
iron
fence
divides
our
grounds
from
theirs
a
golden
cord
of
affection
binds
our
lives
together
our
interests
too
are
the
same
vernon
is
leagued
with
my
husband
in
the
great
engineering
projects
which
have
enriched
them
both
the
capital
to
enlist
in
which
sphere
of
enterprise
was
furnished
by
the
sale
to
a
company
of
our
lands
in
georgia
revealed
to
my
knowledge
as
it
may
be
remembered
by
the
inadvertence
of
gregory
the
career
of
bertie
la
vigne
had
been
a
varied
one
as
might
have
been
foreseen
perhaps
from
her
early
manifestations
and
proclivities
she
came
to
me
while
still
we
dwelt
in
the
city
of
my
birth
when
she
was
approaching
her
seventeenth
year
and
remained
a
twelvemonth
under
my
roof
engaged
in
the
study
of
shakespeare
with
that
accomplished
mortimer
she
intended
to
pursue
what
gift
she
had
of
voice
and
histrionic
talent
as
a
means
of
livelihood
she
told
me
from
the
first
and
to
get
rid
of
the
ineffable
weariness
and
monotony
of
her
life
at
beauseincourt
as
well
the
two
motives
seemed
to
me
to
be
worthy
of
all
praise
there
are
indeed
abodes
that
kill
the
soul
as
well
as
the
body
and
this
was
one
of
them
in
my
estimation
yet
i
remembered
as
a
seeming
inconsistency
that
when
in
her
fourteenth
year
it
was
proposed
that
bertie
should
come
to
me
for
the
purpose
of
attending
schools
for
the
accomplishments
she
steadily
refused
to
do
so
her
sense
of
duty
might
have
been
at
the
root
of
this
firm
and
persistent
refusal
to
accept
from
my
hand
a
gift
richer
far
than
jewels
of
the
mine
the
power
of
varied
occupation
but
something
had
secretly
whispered
to
me
that
this
was
not
all
on
which
her
apparent
was
baaed
and
i
think
that
i
was
right
in
my
conjecture
have
you
seen
a
plant
scathed
by
frost
that
has
made
a
strong
and
successful
effort
to
live
and
still
in
its
struggling
existence
bears
the
mark
of
the
early
blight
on
leaf
and
blossom
such
was
the
impression
made
on
my
mind
by
bertie
la
vigne
after
three
years
of
separation
and
yet
she
had
grown
into
majestic
stature
and
into
comparative
beauty
since
we
parted
at
beauseincourt
tall
slender
straight
as
a
young
with
exquisite
extremities
and
a
face
of
aristocratic
if
not
grecian
proportions
there
still
was
wanting
in
her
step
her
eye
her
smile
that
wonderful
that
had
formed
her
chief
charm
in
her
earlier
years
she
had
been
crystallized
so
to
speak
by
some
strange
process
of
suffering
into
a
cold
and
dull
propriety
never
infringed
on
save
at
times
when
she
found
herself
alone
with
me
and
when
the
old
would
for
a
little
time
possess
her
it
was
not
dead
but
sleeping
and
what
my
dear
bertie
i
said
one
day
when
mortimer
had
departed
and
she
came
to
throw
herself
down
on
the
sofa
in
my
chamber
and
what
has
reconciled
you
to
the
old
parrot
as
you
used
to
call
our
sublime
shakespeare
sublime
i
shall
think
you
affected
miriam
if
you
apply
that
word
again
to
that
old
commonplace
if
he
were
sublime
do
you
suppose
all
the
world
would
read
him
or
go
to
see
his
plays
do
reserve
that
epithet
for
milton
dante
tasso
schiller
and
the
like
inaccessibilities
yes
i
do
revere
more
than
any
thing
shakespeare
ever
spouted
in
answer
to
my
head
i
should
break
down
over
i
should
indeed
do
you
think
his
bed
was
soft
under
the
and
she
waved
her
hand
o
god
what
a
tragedy
what
a
love
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
quivering
palm
bertie
you
are
still
too
excitable
i
am
sorry
to
see
it
philosopher
cure
thyself
yes
i
know
that
was
always
a
fault
of
mine
that
is
why
you
married
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
you
know
i
could
never
have
loved
that
person
describe
the
man
you
think
you
could
have
loved
bertie
la
vigne
could
have
loved
that
time
is
past
forever
child
and
dead
forever
as
shelley
says
was
my
affinity
i
believe
only
he
died
before
i
was
born
what
a
pity
i
would
rather
be
his
widow
than
the
wife
of
any
man
living
would
like
to
hear
that
no
doubt
bertie
well
she
may
hear
it
if
she
chooses
when
i
go
to
england
to
read
the
old
parrot
in
the
right
way
under
their
very
noses
kembles
and
all
i
let
shelley
know
i
there
and
she
laughed
merrily
and
what
is
your
idea
of
the
way
to
read
shakespeare
bertie
dear
i
asked
playfully
as
one
having
authority
a
head
and
shoulders
above
him
and
all
his
prating
just
as
you
would
talk
to
your
next
neighbor
read
him
without
any
fear
of
his
old
ghost
why
miriam
he
knew
himself
better
than
we
knew
him
he
had
no
more
idea
of
being
a
genius
than
you
have
he
was
a
sort
of
artesian
well
of
a
man
and
could
not
help
spouting
platitudes
that
was
all
besides
he
had
eyes
to
see
and
ears
to
hear
and
a
very
yankee
spirit
of
investigation
it
is
the
fashion
to
crack
him
up
like
the
bible
both
encyclopÃ¦dias
that
all
every
man
can
see
himself
in
these
books
and
every
man
likes
a
and
that
the
whole
secret
of
their
success
bertie
you
are
incorrigible
no
i
am
not
only
genuine
i
do
think
there
is
a
good
deal
in
both
of
the
works
in
question
but
their
sublimity
i
dispute
they
are
homely
coarse
commonplace
as
birth
and
death
there
was
something
that
almost
froze
my
blood
in
the
way
she
said
those
last
words
lying
back
upon
the
sofa
with
eyes
and
hands
clasped
beneath
her
head
miriam
she
said
after
a
while
life
is
a
humbug
i
have
thought
so
for
some
time
poor
child
poor
child
ay
poorer
than
the
poorest
miriam
harz
and
laying
aside
my
work
i
went
to
and
knelt
beside
her
and
kissed
her
brow
i
have
no
soul
to
open
i
am
as
empty
as
a
that
the
butterfly
has
gone
out
of
to
dwell
amid
sunshine
and
flowers
yet
i
believe
i
had
one
once
in
ineffably
mournful
accents
but
two
men
killed
it
and
yet
neither
intended
the
blow
o
miriam
i
understand
at
last
what
coleridge
meant
by
his
life
in
death
there
is
such
a
thing
and
that
great
necromancer
found
it
out
i
am
the
breathing
impersonation
of
that
loathly
thing
i
believe
listen
and
she
sat
up
with
one
raised
finger
and
gave
the
poet
words
with
rare
expression
nightmare
life
in
death
was
she
that
chilled
men
blood
with
cold
does
that
describe
me
as
i
am
miriam
you
are
indeed
much
changed
bertie
perhaps
it
would
be
well
could
you
confide
in
me
no
it
would
not
be
well
i
never
could
keep
any
thing
wholly
to
myself
neither
can
i
tell
it
wholly
even
to
such
as
you
reticent
merciful
but
this
believe
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
to
wear
sackcloth
and
ashes
for
and
i
am
preparing
to
put
my
foot
on
it
all
ay
from
the
snake
head
of
first
discovery
to
the
snake
tail
of
the
last
disappointment
ranging
over
half
a
dozen
years
a
long
serpent
truly
laughing
but
i
mean
to
be
galvanized
and
get
back
my
life
i
am
determined
to
be
famous
rich
beautiful
and
she
nodded
to
me
with
the
old
sweet
sparkle
in
her
eye
the
glad
smile
on
her
lip
you
laugh
at
the
last
threat
laugh
on
who
laughs
best
laughs
last
says
the
old
proverb
there
is
such
a
thing
as
training
features
is
there
as
well
as
one
setters
miriam
i
shall
develop
slowly
i
am
still
in
my
very
downiest
adolescence
as
to
looks
you
will
see
me
when
i
have
filled
out
and
ripened
and
when
i
put
on
my
grand
marie
antoinette
some
day
hair
drawn
back
la
powdered
with
a
touch
of
rouge
perhaps
on
either
cheek
ruffles
of
rich
lace
at
shoulders
and
elbows
pink
brocade
and
emeralds
picked
out
with
diamonds
mortimer
teachings
in
every
graceful
movement
it
will
be
all
humbug
for
i
have
no
real
beauty
not
much
grace
but
people
will
think
me
beautiful
and
graceful
for
all
that
while
i
wear
my
costumes
they
are
several
this
is
only
one
all
highly
becoming
i
have
a
vision
of
a
dress
and
of
a
robe
trimmed
and
twisted
everywhere
with
flowers
of
yellow
jasmine
of
and
tipped
marabouts
in
my
hair
also
of
an
azure
silk
with
blond
and
pearls
and
a
tiara
on
my
forehead
she
laughed
archly
you
do
know
my
capabilities
my
dear
for
appearing
to
look
well
they
are
wonderful
the
very
prospect
transfigures
you
bertie
i
am
glad
you
are
so
courageous
were
you
courageous
when
you
clung
to
your
ropes
on
the
raft
no
miriam
that
was
instinct
nothing
more
and
i
too
have
very
strong
intuitions
of
heaven
grant
that
they
may
be
successful
let
us
pray
and
with
moving
lips
and
lids
from
beneath
which
the
large
tears
stole
one
by
one
like
crystal
globes
this
suffering
spirit
communed
with
its
god
silently
so
best
i
felt
bertie
was
only
a
scoffer
her
heart
was
open
to
conviction
yet
and
when
the
time
came
i
believed
that
the
seed
sown
in
old
days
would
germinate
and
bear
good
harvest
all
was
chaos
now
shall
i
keep
on
with
bertie
now
that
the
theme
has
possession
of
me
and
go
back
to
the
others
when
she
is
finally
dismissed
i
think
this
will
be
wisest
especially
as
my
space
is
small
and
mood
concentrative
rather
than
erratic
let
us
pass
over
then
five
eventful
years
during
which
the
sorrows
and
changes
i
have
spoken
of
had
taken
place
and
wentworth
had
fixed
his
home
in
the
vicinity
of
san
francisco
i
had
heard
of
bertie
in
the
interval
as
a
successful
as
a
reader
of
shakespeare
and
had
received
her
sparse
and
sparkling
letters
confirming
report
truly
angel
visits
few
and
far
between
at
last
one
came
announcing
her
intention
of
visiting
california
professionally
and
sojourning
beneath
my
roof
while
in
san
francisco
it
was
to
be
a
stay
of
several
weeks
she
was
accompanied
and
sometimes
assisted
by
and
mortimer
professional
readers
both
the
last
distinguished
more
for
grace
and
beauty
even
though
now
on
the
wane
of
life
than
she
ever
had
been
for
talent
but
eminently
fitted
both
by
education
and
character
for
a
guide
and
companion
an
english
maid
as
perfect
as
an
automaton
in
her
training
and
regularity
accompanied
bertie
to
whom
were
confided
all
details
of
dress
all
keys
and
jewels
with
entire
confidence
and
safety
an
elaborate
doll
seemed
the
and
euphemia
yet
was
she
adroit
obedient
and
expert
just
to
move
in
the
groove
of
her
requirements
i
have
spoken
only
of
her
accessories
but
now
for
bertie
herself
is
she
not
magnificent
was
my
exclamation
when
alone
with
my
husband
on
the
night
of
her
arrival
after
our
guest
with
her
sparkling
face
and
conversation
her
superb
toilet
and
bearing
her
graceful
walk
had
retired
to
her
chamber
attended
by
the
mechanical
miss
euphemia
the
mortimers
with
their
children
and
servants
remained
at
the
principal
hotel
the
very
word
for
her
he
replied
only
that
and
nothing
more
wardour
well
love
how
little
enthusiasm
you
possess
about
the
beautiful
now
if
there
were
question
of
a
new
the
vocabulary
would
have
been
exhausted
what
would
you
have
me
say
dear
is
not
that
word
a
very
comprehensive
one
the
lady
is
indeed
magnificent
but
miriam
where
is
bertie
and
he
laughed
ah
i
understand
you
find
her
artificial
she
is
too
fine
an
actress
for
that
miriam
only
transfigured
yes
i
see
what
you
mean
sadly
bertie
wholly
changed
whom
does
she
resemble
wardour
what
queen
bethink
you
whose
likeness
you
have
seen
not
mary
queen
of
scots
not
elizabeth
no
surely
not
but
she
is
now
that
you
draw
my
attention
to
it
strikingly
like
marie
antoinette
she
said
she
would
be
and
she
has
succeeded
and
i
mused
on
the
wonderful
transition
four
years
more
and
we
heard
of
bertie
in
england
as
the
and
beautiful
american
reader
lavinia
la
vigne
out
of
the
of
her
family
names
she
had
fished
up
this
alliteration
and
bertie
was
reserved
for
those
behind
the
scenes
it
was
declared
also
in
the
public
sheets
what
great
and
distinguished
men
were
in
her
train
how
wits
bowed
to
her
wit
and
authors
to
her
criticisms
but
when
she
wrote
to
me
she
said
nothing
of
all
this
only
telling
of
her
visit
to
shelley
who
had
received
her
kindly
and
to
the
tomb
of
shakespeare
whose
painted
effigy
she
especially
derided
it
looks
indeed
like
a
man
who
would
cut
his
wife
off
with
an
old
and
a
teakettle
was
one
of
her
characteristic
remarks
i
remember
but
there
was
a
little
postscript
that
told
the
whole
story
of
her
life
on
a
separate
scrap
of
paper
meant
only
for
my
eye
i
clearly
saw
and
committed
instantly
to
the
flames
after
perusal
ah
miriam
this
is
all
a
magic
lantern
the
people
are
phantoms
the
realities
are
shadows
and
i
a
wretched
humbug
duller
than
all
two
men
have
lived
and
breathed
for
me
on
the
face
of
this
earth
two
only
one
was
my
and
father
the
other
o
miriam
to
think
of
him
is
crime
but
in
his
life
and
that
alone
i
live
i
send
you
praed
last
beautiful
little
song
him
i
love
him
yet
it
will
tell
you
every
thing
an
answer
i
have
scribbled
to
it
as
if
written
by
a
man
keep
both
and
when
i
am
dead
should
you
survive
me
dear
lay
them
if
you
can
in
my
coffin
close
close
to
my
heart
three
years
more
and
bertie
is
in
rome
independent
at
last
through
her
own
exertions
and
able
to
gratify
her
tastes
i
receive
thence
statues
and
pictures
and
cameos
all
exquisite
of
their
kind
her
princely
gifts
her
legacies
then
comes
a
long
silence
she
knew
what
faith
was
mine
when
she
last
abode
beneath
my
roof
and
made
herself
a
little
impertinently
merry
at
my
expense
in
consequence
of
this
new
order
of
things
now
comes
a
letter
a
paper
envelope
accompanying
it
bertie
la
vigne
has
entered
the
catholic
church
through
baptism
and
confirmation
so
briefly
states
the
letter
written
in
her
own
hand
and
of
date
some
months
back
retained
no
doubt
through
forgetfullness
until
reminded
the
paper
of
recent
issue
tells
of
the
ceremony
at
peter
which
admitted
to
the
novitiate
several
noble
ladies
native
and
foreign
and
among
the
rest
an
of
merit
miss
lavinia
la
vigne
of
georgia
united
states
of
america
on
the
margin
of
the
paper
were
a
few
penciled
words
in
her
own
handwriting
i
have
found
the
reality
this
was
all
i
shall
never
see
her
again
unless
i
go
to
rome
and
then
only
through
a
grating
or
in
the
presence
of
others
like
herself
for
she
has
taken
the
black
veil
and
retired
behind
a
shadow
deep
as
that
cast
from
the
tomb
yet
under
existing
circumstances
and
in
consideration
of
her
early
experiences
which
no
success
nor
later
future
could
obliterate
or
render
less
unendurable
i
believe
she
has
chosen
the
wiser
part
peace
be
with
thee
bertie
whether
in
earth
or
in
heaven
editor
some
years
after
the
closing
of
miriam
retrospect
the
civil
war
broke
out
in
the
united
stales
and
pope
pius
ix
was
pleased
to
grant
permission
to
several
american
nuns
southern
ladies
whose
vocation
was
religious
to
visit
their
own
states
and
lend
what
succor
spiritual
and
physical
they
could
to
the
wounded
and
dying
on
the
and
in
the
confederate
camps
among
these
came
the
sister
ursula
from
the
convent
of
the
cartusians
known
once
as
lavinia
or
bertie

was
particularly
fearless
and
efficient
and
was
killed

for
some
years
a
pale
and
shadowy
being
refusing
all
intercourse
with
society
and
vowed
to
gloom
and
hypochondria
it
was
her
strange
and
mournful
mania
to
look
upon

human
creatures

suspicion
nay
with
loathing

couch

tame
from
the
laundry
and
touched
only
with
gloved
hands
by
herself
as
were
the
books
into
which
she
occasionally
glanced
for
solace
most
of
her
time
was
spent
in
gazing
from
her
window
that
overlooked
the
bay
and
dreaming
of
the
return
of
one
who
had
long
since
heartlessly
deserted
her
leaving
her
dependent
on
those
she
had
injured
and
from
whom
she
bitterly
and
even
derisively
received
shelter
tender
ministry
and
all
possible
manifestations
of
compassion
and
interest
her
mind
had
been
partially
overthrown
at
the
time
of
her
desertion
and
her
dead
baby
birth
events
that
occurred
almost
conjointly
and
it
was
the
wreck
of
evelyn
erle
we
cherished
until
her
slow
consumption
long
delayed
by
the
balmy
air
of
california
culminated
mercifully
to
herself
and
all
around
her
and
removed
her
from
this
sphere
of
suffering
whither
alas
the
impotence
of
that
question
are
there
not
beings
who
seem
indeed
to
lack
the
great
essential
for
salvation
a
soul
to
be
saved
how
far
are
such
responsible
claude
bainrothe
is
married
again
and
not
to
ada
greene
who
outcast
and
poor
came
some
years
since
as
an
adventuress
to
california
and
signalized
herself
later
in
the
as
a
leader
of
great
audacity
beauty
and
reckless
extravagance
the
lady
of
his
choice
or
heart
was
a
fat
baroness
about
twenty
years
his
senior
who
lets
apartments
and
maintains
the
externes
of
her
rank
in
a
saloon
fifteen
feet
square
furnished
with
red
velveteen
and
accessible
by
means
of
an
antechamber
paved
with
tiles
he
has
grown
stout
drinks
beer
and
smokes
a
meerschaum
but
is
still
known
on
the
principal
promenade
and
in
the
casino
of
the
german
town
in
which
he
resides
as
the
handsome
american
he
is
said
however
to
have
spells
of
melancholy
the
chevalier
bainrothan
and
the
lady
charlotte
fremont
his
for
as
such
she
passes
for
some
quaint
or
wicked
reason
unrevealed
to
society
with
their
respectable
and
hideous
madame
clayton
dwell
under
the
same
roof
and
enjoy
the
privilege
of
access
to
the
of
the
baroness
and
a
weekly
game
of
at
her
usually
profitable
to
the
chevalier
in
a
small
way
all
this
did
major
favraud
in
his
own
merry
mood
communicate
to
us
on
the
occasion
of
his
memorable
visit
to
san
francisco
when
he
remained
our
delighted
guest
during
one
long
delicious
summer
season
of
gregory
we
never
heard
i
had
hoped
to
hear
of
your
marriage
long
before
this
i
said
to
him
one
day
tell
me
why
you
have
not
wedded
some
fair
lady
before
this
time
now
tell
me
frankly
as
you
can
simply
because
you
did
not
wait
for
me
nonsense
the
truth
i
want
no
because
then
because
i
never
could
forget
celia
never
love
any
one
else
she
was
one
of
swedenborg
angels
major
favraud
no
real
wife
of
yours
she
never
was
married
and
i
shook
my
head
only
united
to
a
being
of
the
earth
with
whom
she
had
no
real
affinity
choose
yours
elsewhere
i
believe
you
are
half
right
he
said
sadly
she
never
seemed
to
belong
to
me
by
right
only
a
bird
i
had
caught
and
caged
that
loved
me
well
yet
was
eager
to
escape
such
was
the
state
of
the
case
i
can
not
doubt
a
more
out
and
out
organization
would
suit
you
better
your
life
is
not
half
spent
the
dreary
time
is
to
come
go
back
to
bellevue
and
get
you
a
kind
companion
and
let
children
climb
your
knees
and
surround
your
hearth
you
would
be
so
much
happier
suggest
one
then
come
help
me
to
a
wife
no
no
i
can
make
no
matches
but
you
know
madame
de
aube
is
a
widow
now
you
were
always
congenial
yes
but
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
worthy
of
a
frenchman
voulez
vous
that
woman
has
five
children
already
and
a
plantation
mortgaged
to
maginnis
maginnis
again
the
very
name
sends
a
chill
through
my
bones
no
that
will
never
do
some
maiden
lady
then
some
sage
person
of
or
five
i
do
not
fancy
such
i
tell
you
what
i
believe
i
will
go
back
and
court
bertie
on
some
of
her
rounds
and
make
a
decent
woman
of
that
little
vagabond
because
she
was
disappointed
once
is
that
a
reason
great
heavens
this
tongue
of
mine
cut
it
out
wentworth
and
cast
it
to
the
seals
in
the
bay
i
came
very
near
betraying
what
i
have
long
suspected
major
favraud
who
that
man
do
ask
me
my
dear
woman
i
must
not
say
another
word
in
honor
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
affair
a
sheer
misunderstanding
he
loved
her
all
the
time
i
knew
this
but
you
know
her
manner
he
did
not
understand
her
flippant
way
her
keen
unsparing
and
bitter
wit
her
devoted
passionate
proud
and
breaking
heart
and
so
there
was
a
coolness
and
they
parted
and
what
happened
afterward
nearly
killed
her
so
she
left
her
home
i
must
not
ask
you
i
feel
for
you
say
you
can
not
tell
me
more
in
honor
but
i
think
i
know
the
man
of
all
the
earth
i
would
have
chosen
for
her
oh
hard
is
woman
fate
to
the
very
last
i
have
reserved
what
lay
nearest
my
heart
of
hearts
three
children
have
been
born
to
us
in
california
and
have
made
our
home
a
paradise
the
two
elder
are
sons
named
severally
for
my
father
and
theirs
reginald
and
wardour
the
last
is
a
daughter
a
second
mabel
beautiful
as
the
first
and
strangely
resembling
her
though
of
a
stronger
frame
and
more
vital
nature
she
is
the
sunshine
of
the
house
the
idol
of
her
father
and
brothers
who
are
mine
as
well
as
the
fair
child
of
seven
summers
herself
austin
presides
in
imagination
over
our
nursery
but
in
reality
is
only
its
most
honored
occasional
visitor
her
chamber
being
distinct
and
my
own
rule
being
absolute
therein
with
the
aid
of
a
docile
adjunct
ernest
wentworth
our
adopted
son
for
want
of
any
other
name
is
the
standard
of
perfection
in
mind
and
morals
for
the
imitation
of
the
rest
of
the
band
of
children
he
has
gained
the
usual
stature
of
young
men
of
his
age
with
a
slight
defect
of
curvature
of
the
shoulders
that
does
but
confirm
his
scholarly
appearance
his
face
with
its
magnificent
brow
piercing
dark
eyes
pale
complexion
and
clustering
hair
is
striking
if
not
handsome
he
has
graduated
as
a
student
of
law
and
should
his
health
permit
will
i
can
not
doubt
distinguish
himself
as
a
forensic
orator
george
gaston
and
madge
have
promised
a
visit
to
the
vernons
but
i
can
not
help
hoping
rather
without
than
any
good
reason
that
they
will
not
come
i
love
them
both
yet
i
feel
they
are
mismated
even
if
happy
my
husband
is
noted
among
his
peers
for
his
liberal
and
use
of
a
princely
income
and
his
great
public
spirit
he
unites
agricultural
pursuits
with
his
profession
and
has
placed
among
other
managers
my
old
ally
christian
garth
and
his
family
on
the
ranch
he
holds
nearest
to
san
francisco
thence
at
due
seasons
seated
on
a
wain
loaded
with
the
fruits
of
their
labor
the
worthy
pair
come
up
to
the
city
to
trade
and
never
fail
in
their
tribute
to
our
house
the
immigrant
possessed
of
worth
and
industry
however
poor
the
adventurous
man
who
seeks
by
the
aid
of
his
profession
alone
to
establish
himself
in
california
the
artist
the
man
of
letters
all
meet
a
helping
hand
from
wardour
wentworth
who
in
his
charities
observes
but
one
principle
of
action
one
hope
of
recompense
both
to
be
found
in
the
teachings
of
philanthropy
as
i
do
unto
you
go
you
and
do
unto
others
this
is
his
maxim
our
lives
have
been
strangely
happy
and
successful
up
to
this
hour
so
that
sometimes
my
emotional
nature
too
often
in
extremes
trembles
beneath
its
burden
of
prosperity
and
conjures
up
strange
phantoms
of
dark
possibilities
that
send
me
tearful
and
depressed
to
my
arms
to
find
strength
and
courage
in
his
rare
and
calm
philosophy
and
equipoise
never
on
his
sweet
serene
brow
have
i
seen
a
frown
of
discontent
or
a
cloud
of
sourceless
sorrow
such
as
too
often
come
the
last
especially
to
mine
born
of
that
melancholy
which
has
its
root
far
back
in
the
bosoms
of
my
ancestors
such
as
his
life
is
he
accepts
it
manfully
and
in
his
shadow
i
find
protection
and
grow
strong
