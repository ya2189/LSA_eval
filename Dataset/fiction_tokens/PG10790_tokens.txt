the
old
man
stood
by
the
window
gazing
at
the
frozen
fields
beyond
the
sign
of
the
cauliflower
was
stiff
with
snow
and
the
breath
of
a
pair
of
waiting
horses
in
a
wagon
beneath
ascended
in
clouds
of
steam
illustration
the
sign
of
the
cauliflower
was
stiff
with
snow
amusements
he
said
slowly
as
he
came
back
with
a
shiver
and
resuming
his
seat
by
the
fire
looked
at
the
wayfarer
who
had
been
idly
questioning
him
claybury
men
do
have
much
time
for
amusements
the
last
one
i
can
call
to
mind
was
bill
chambers
being
nailed
up
in
a
he
was
cleaning
out
but
there
was
such
a
fuss
made
over
that
by
bill
that
it
sort
o
disheartened
people
he
got
up
again
restlessly
and
walking
round
the
table
gazed
long
and
hard
into
three
or
four
mugs
sometimes
a
little
gets
left
in
them
he
explained
meeting
the
stranger
inquiring
glance
the
latter
started
and
knocking
on
the
table
with
the
handle
of
his
knife
explained
that
he
had
been
informed
by
a
man
outside
that
his
companion
was
the
bitterest
teetotaller
in
claybury
that
one
o
bob
pretty
larks
said
the
old
man
flushing
i
see
you
talking
to
and
i
thought
as
he
war
up
to
no
good
biggest
rascal
in
claybury
he
is
i
said
so
afore
and
i
say
so
agin
he
bowed
to
the
donor
and
buried
his
old
face
in
the
mug
a
poacher
he
said
taking
breath
a
thief
he
continued
after
another
draught
i
wonder
whether
smith
spilt
any
of
this
of
it
in
he
put
down
the
empty
mug
and
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
floor
until
a
musical
rapping
on
the
table
brought
the
landlord
into
the
room
again
my
best
respects
he
said
gratefully
as
he
placed
the
mug
on
the
settle
by
his
side
and
slowly
filled
a
long
clay
pipe
next
time
you
see
bob
pretty
ask
wot
happened
to
the
prize
hamper
he
done
a
good
many
things
has
bob
but
it
be
a
long
time
afore
claybury
men

over
that

been
away
to
see
an
uncle
of
wife
wot

it
to
leastways
so
henery
thought
when
he
wasted
his
money
going
over
to

he
came
back
full
of
the
idea

he
picked
up
from

arter
a
pint
o
beer

soon
and
bob
pretty
going
off
with

and
they
stood
outside

the
bitter
cold
for
over
arf
an
hour
still
trying
to
make
up
their
minds
to
get
that
hamper

another
and
at

at
it
and
while
they
are
out
another
chap
can
go
in
and

seemed
a
wunnerful
good
idea
and

things
about

gave
way
bob

was
just
starting
off
to
see
policeman

when
they
took
the
money
and
instead
o
telling
wot
they
thought
of
as
they
intended
henery
walker
to
walk
alongside
of
and
beg
and
pray
of
to
take
the
money
he
took
it
at
last
as
a
favor
to
henery
and
bought
the
hamper
back
with
it
next
morning

leastways
he
said
so
