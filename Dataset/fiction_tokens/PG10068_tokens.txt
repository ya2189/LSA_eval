chapter
i
the
birth
of
a
whose
cradle
that
the
sick
woman
thin
querulous
tones
arrested
the
man
at
the
threshold
onie
dillard
he
replied
hollowly
from
the
depths
of
the
crib
which
he
carried
upside
down
upon
his
head
like
some
curious
kind
of
overgrown
helmet
now
why
in
the
name
o
common
sense
would
ye
go
and
borry
a
broken
cradle
came
the
wail
from
the
bed
i

said
enthusiastically
pros

uncle
of
the
sick
woman
and
mainstay
of
the
forlorn
little
consadine
household

always
full
of
enthusiasm

few
nails
and
a
little
wrappin
of
twine

informed
his
niece

the
further
end
of
the
room
came
a
woman
with
a
little
bundle
in
her
arm
which
had
evidently
created
the
necessity
for
the
borrowed
cradle
laurelly
the
nurse
hesitated
i
would
name
it
to
ye
whilst
ye
was
but

half

as
selfish
said
she
like
to

how
i
was
goin
to
inshore
her
that
it
would
be
twins
agin
same
as
was
before
some
folks
is
powerful
mean
an
suspicious
all
this
time
the
nurse
had
been
standing
with
the
quiet
small
packet
which
was
the
storm
centre
of
preparation
lying
like
a
cocoon
or
a
giant
against
her
bosom
she
a
mighty
likely
little
gal
said
she
finally
have
ye
any
hopes
o
gittin
anything
to
put
on
her
the
woman
in
the
bed
she
was
scarcely
more
than
a
girl
with
shining
dark
eyes
and
a
profusion
of
jetty
ringlets
about
her
elfish
pretty
little
face
seemed
to
feel
that
this
speech
was
in
the
nature
of
a
reproach
she
hastened
to
detail
her
further
activities
on
behalf
of
the
newcomer
consadine
a
poor
provider
she
said
plaintively
alluding
to
her
absent
husband
maw
said
to
me
when
i
would
have
him
that
he
was
a
poor
provider
and
then
he
got
into
this
here
way
of
goin
off
like
time
things
gets
too
bad
here
at
home
he
got
a
big
scheme
up
for
makin
his
fortune
somewhars
else
and
out
he
puts
he
he
be
home
with
a
plenty
before
the
baby
come
but
thar
he
the
best
man
that
ever
was
when
he
here
and
i
have
no
wish
to
miscall
him
i
reckon
he
thought
i
could
borry
what
i
need
biney
meal
lent
me
enough
for
the
little
un
that
died
but
of
course
some
o
the
coats
was
buried
with
the
child
and
what
was
left
sis
elvira
borried
for
her
baby
i
was
layin
off
to
go
over
to
the
deep
spring
neighbourhood
when
i
could
git
a
lift
in
that
direction
the
folks
over
yon
is
mighty
accommodative
she
concluded
but
i
was
took
sooner
than
i
expected
and
hyer
we
air
without
a
stitch
i
done
sont
bud
an
honey
to
mandy
ann
foncher
mebby
they
bring
in
somethin
the
little
cabin
shrank
back
against
the
steep
side
of
the
mountain
as
though
half
terrified
at
the
hollow
immensity
of
the
welkin
above
or
the
almost
sheer
drop
to
the
valley
five
hundred
feet
beneath
a
sidling
mountain
trail
passed
the
front
of
its
rail
fence
and
stones
continually
rolled
from
the
upper
to
the
lower
side
of
this
highway
the
day
was
darkening
rapidly
a
low
line
of
red
still
burned
behind
the
massive
bulk
of
big
unaka
and
the
solemn
purple
mountains
raised
their
peaks
against
it
in
a
jagged
line
within
die
cabin
the
rich
broken
light
from
the
cavernous
fireplace
filled
the
interior
full
of
shadow
and
shine
in
which
things
leaped
oddly
into
life
or
dropped
out
of
knowledge
with
a
startling
effect
the
four
corners
of
the
log
room
were
utilized
three
of
them
for
beds
made
by
thrusting
two
poles
through
auger
holes
bored
in
the
logs
of
the
walls
setting
a
leg
at
the
corner
where
these
met
and
lacing
the
bottom
with
hickory
withes
the
fourth
had
some
rude
planks
nailed
in
it
for
a
table
and
a
in
one
of
the
logs
served
the
primitive
purpose
of
a
a
pack
of
gaunt
hounds
quarrelled
under
the
floor
and
the
sick
woman
stirred
uneasily
on
her
bed
and
expressed
a
wish
that
her
emissaries
would
return
uncle
pros
had
taken
the
cradle
to
a
back
door
to
get
the
last
of
the
evening
sun
upon
his
task
one
would
not
have
thought
that
he
could
hear
what
the
women
were
saying
at
this
distance
but
the
old
hunter
ears
were
sharp
never
you
mind
laurelly
he
called
cheerfully
wrop
the
baby
up
some
fashion
and
i
hike
out
and
get
clothes
for
her
time
i
mend
this
cradle
ef
that
ai
just
like
unc
pros
and
the
girlish
mother
laughed
out
suddenly
you
saw
the
gypsy
beauty
of
her
face
he
ai
content
with
borryin
men
truck
but
thinks
he
can
turn
in
an
borry
coats
the
women
well
i
reckon
he
might
have
better
luck
than
what
i
did
as
she
spoke
a
small
boy
and
girl
her
dead
brother
children
came
clattering
in
from
the
purple
mysteries
of
dusk
outside
hand
clasped
in
hand
and
stopped
close
to
the
bed
staring
mandy
ann
she
would
lend
us
a
thing

began
in
an
aggrieved
tone
i
traded
for
this
chopped
wood
for
it
and
hit
was
all
she
would
give
me
he
laid
a
coarse
little
garment
upon
the
ragged
coverlet
that
cried
laurella

taking
it
up
with
angrily
tremulous
fingers
my
child

go
over
as
far
as
my
house
right
now
i
ai
skeered

honey

returned
the
boy
doubtfully
as
he
interrogated
the
twilit
spaces
beyond
the
open
cabin
door
well
you
go
ask
pap
to
look
in
the
green
chist
and
send

the
spotted
caliker
poke

big

not

what

the
spotted
poke
ai
nothin
that
he
wants
tell
him
it
well
tell
him
to
look
at
it
before
he
gives
it
to
you
the
two
little
souls
scuttled
away
into
the
gathering
dark
and
the
neighbour
woman
sat
down
by
the
fire
to
nurse
the
baby
and
croon
and
await
the
clothing
for
which
she
had
sent
she
was
not
an
old
woman
but
already
stiff
and
misshapen
by
toil
and
the
lack
of
that
saving
salt
of
pride
the
stimulation
of
joy
which
keeps
us
erect
and
supple
her
broad
back
was
bent
her
hands
as
they
shifted
the
infant
tenderly
were
knotted
and
mavity
bence
was
a
widow
living
at
home
with
her
father
gideon
himes
she
had
one
child
left
a
daughter
but
the
clothing
for
which
she
had
sent
was
an
outfit
made
for
a
son
the
posthumous
offspring
of
his
father
and
the
babe
had
not
lived
long
enough
to
wear
it
outside
uncle
pros
began
to
sing
at
his
work
he
had
a
fluty
old
tenor
voice
and
he
put
in
turns
and
quavers
that
no
ear
not
of
the
mountains
could
possibly
follow
and
fix
first
it
was
a
hymn
all
abrupt
odd
minor
cadences
and
monotonous
refrain
then
he
shifted
to
a
ballad
and
the
mountains
are
full
of
old
ballads
of
scotland
and
england
come
down
from
the
time
of
the
first
settlers
and
with
local
names
quaintly
substituted
for
the
originals
here
and
there
she
gwine
to
walk
in
a
silken
gownd
an
plenty
o
siller
for
to
spare
chanted
the
old
man
above
the
little
bed
he
was
repairing
who
that
you
that
to
have
silk
dresses
inquired
laurella
as
he
entered
and
set
the
mended
cradle
down
by
the
bedside
the
baby
he
returned
ef
i
find
my
silver
mine
or
ruther
i
find
my
silver
mine
for
you
know
in
reason
with
the
directions
grandpap
left
and
that
word
from
great
uncle
billy
that
helped
the
injuns
work
it
i
bound
to
run
the
thing
down
one
o
these
days
when
i
find
my
silver
mine
this
here
little
gal
to
have
everything
she
wants
ai
ye
pretty
and
having
made
a
bed
in
the
cradle
from
some
folded
covers
he
lifted
the
baby
with
strange
deftness
and
placed
it
in
see
thar
he
called
their
attention
proudly
as
good
as
new
and
ef
i
git
time
i
to
give
it
a
few
licks
o
paint
hands
on
knees
he
bent
to
study
the
face
of
the
that
countenance
so
ambiguous
to
our
eyes
scarce
stamped
yet
with
the
common
seal
of
humanity
she
a
mighty
pretty
little
gal
he
repeated
mavity
bence
words
she
got
the
passmore
favour
as
well
as
the
consadine
reckon
i
better
be
steppin
over
to
vander
and
see
can
i
borry
their
cow
if
it
with
you
this
time
like
it
was
with
the
last
one
we
have
to
have
a
cow
i
always
thought
if
we
had
a
fresh
cow
for
that
other
one
hit
would
lived
i
know
in
reason
vander
lend
the
cow
for
a
spell
uncle
pros
always
had
unbounded
confidence
in
the
good
will
of
his
neighbours
toward
himself
since
his
own
generosity
to
them
would
have
been
fathomless
i
know
in
reason
he
lend
hit
they
got
no
baby
to
their
house
he
bestowed
one
more
proud
fond
look
upon
the
little
face
in
the
borrowed
cradle
and
walked
out
with
as
elated
a
step
as
though
a
queen
had
been
born
to
the
tribe
in
the
doorway
he
met
bud
and
honey
returning
with
the
spotted
calico
poke
clutched
fast
between
them
i
wo
ask
nothin
but
a
wearin
of
em
for
my
child
laurella
consadine
born
laurella
passmore
reiterated
when
the
small
garments
were
laid
out
on
the
bed
and
the
baby
was
being
dressed
mighty
fine
mavity
an
i
take
good
keer
of
and
always
bear
in
mind
that
they
only
borried
no
returned
mavity
bence
with
unwonted
firmness
as
she
put
the
newcomer
into
the
slip
intended
for
her
own
son
no
laurelly
these
clothes
ai
loaned
to
you
i
give
to
this
child
i
a
widder
and
i
never
look
to
wed
again
becaze
pap
he
has
to
have
somebody
to
do
for
him
an
he
just
about
tear
up
the
ground
if
i
was
to
name
sech
a
thing
i
mighty
glad
to
give
to
yo
little
gal
i
only
wisht
she
said
wistfully
that
hit
was
a
boy
ef
hit
was
a
boy
mebbe
you
give
hit
the
name
that
should
went
with
the
clothes
i
was
to
call
the
baby
john
after
hit
pappy
laurella
consadine
lay
quiescent
for
a
moment
big
black
eyes
studying
the
smoky
logs
that
raftered
the
roof
then
all
at
once
she
laughed
with
a
flash
of
white
teeth
i
do
see
why
johnnie
ai
a
mighty
fine
name
for
a
gal
she
said
i
vow
i
to
name
her
johnnie
and
so
this
one
of
the
tribe
of
borrowing
passmores
wore
her
own
clothing
from
the
first
no
borrowed
garment
touched
her
she
rejected
the
milk
from
the
borrowed
cow
fiercely
lustily
she
demanded
and
eventually
received
her
own
legitimate
unborrowed
sustenance
perhaps
such
a
beginning
had
its
own
influence
upon
her
future
chapter
ii
the
birth
of
an
ambition
all
day
the
girl
had
walked
steadily
her
bare
feet
comforted
by
the
warm
dust
shunning
the
pebbles
never
finding
sham
stones
in
the
way
making
friends
with
the
path
that
would
always
be
johnnie
from
the
little
valley
in
the
remote
fastnesses
of
the
unakas
where
she
was
born
johnnie
consadine
was
walking
down
to
cottonville
the
factory
town
on
the
outskirts
of
watauga
to
find
work
sometimes
the
road
wound
a
little
upward
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
but
the
general
tendency
was
persistently
down
in
the
gray
dawn
of
sunday
morning
she
had
stepped
from
the
door
of
that
room
where
the
three
beds
occupied
three
corners
and
a
rude
table
was
rigged
in
the
fourth
it
might
almost
seem
that
the
same
hounds
were
quarrelling
under
the
floor
that
had
scrambled
there
eighteen
years
before
when
she
was
born
at
first
the
way
was
entirely
familiar
to
her
it
passed
few
habitations
and
of
those
the
dwellers
were
not
yet
abroad
since
it
was
scarce
day
as
time
went
on
she
got
to
the
little
settlement
at
the
foot
of
the
first
mountain
and
had
to
explain
to
everybody
her
destination
and
ambition
beyond
this
she
stopped
occasionally
for
direction
she
met
more
people
yet
she
was
still
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
when
noon
found
her
and
she
crept
up
a
wayside
bank
and
sat
down
alone
to
eat
her
bite
of
corn
pone
guided
by
the
instinct
or
the
of
the
mountain
born
and
bred
she
had
sought
out
one
of
the
hermit
springs
of
beautiful
freestone
water
that
hide
in
these
solitudes
when
she
had
slaked
her
thirst
at
its
little
chalice
she
raised
her
head
with
a
low
exclamation
of
rapture
there
growing
and
blowing
beside
the
cool
thread
of
water
which
trickled
from
the
spring
was
a
stately
pink
moccasin
flower
she
knelt
and
gazed
at
it
with
folded
hands
as
one
before
a
shrine
what
is
it
in
the
sweeping
dignity
of
these
pointed
oval
leaves
sheathed
one
within
another
the
clean
column
of
the
bloom
stalk
rising
a
foot
and
a
half
perhaps
above
and
at
its
tip
the
wonderful
pink
dreaming
buddha
of
the
forest
that
so
commands
the
heart
it
was
not
entirely
the
beauty
of
the
softly
glowing
orchid
that
charmed
johnnie
consadine
eyes
it
was
the
significance
of
the
flower
somehow
the
finding
this
rare
shy
thing
decking
her
path
toward
labour
and
enterprise
spoke
to
her
soul
of
success
for
a
long
time
she
knelt
her
bright
uncovered
head
dappled
by
a
ray
of
sunlight
which
filtered
through
the
deep
cool
green
above
her
her
face
bent
her
eyes
brooding
as
though
she
prayed
when
she
had
finished
her
dinner
of
corn
pone
and
fried
pork
she
rose
and
parted
with
almost
reverent
fingers
the
pink
wonder
from
its
stalk
sought
out
a
coarse
clean
handkerchief
from
her
bundle
and
steeping
it
in
the
icy
water
of
the
spring
lapped
it
around
her
treasure
not
often
in
her
eighteen
summers
had
she
found
so
fine
a
specimen
then
she
took
up
her
journey
comforted
and
strangely
elated
looks
like
it
was
waiting
right
there
to
tell
me
howdy
she
murmured
to
herself
the
keynote
of
johnnie
consadine
character
was
aspiration
in
her
cabin
home
the
wings
of
desire
were
clipped
because
she
must
needs
put
her
passionate
young
soul
into
the
longing
for
food
to
quiet
the
cravings
of
a
healthy
stomach
which
generally
clamoured
from
one
blackberry
season
to
the
other
the
longing
for
shoes
when
her
feet
were
frostbitten
the
yet
more
urgent
wish
to
feed
the
little
ones
she
loved
the
pressing
demand
when
the
gave
out
and
they
had
to
pack
water
in
a
tin
tomato
can
with
a
string
bail
the
dull
ache
of
mortification
when
she
became
old
enough
to
understand
their
position
as
the
borrowing
passmores
yet
all
human
desire
is
sacred
and
of
god
to
desire
to
want
to
aspire
thus
shall
the
individual
be
saved
and
surely
in
this
is
the
salvation
of
the
race
and
johnnie
felt
vaguely
that
at
last
she
was
going
out
into
a
world
where
she
should
learn
what
to
desire
and
how
to
desire
it
now
as
she
tramped
she
was
conning
over
her
present
plans
again
she
saw
the
cabin
at
home
in
that
pitchy
black
which
precedes
the
first
leavening
of
dawn
and
herself
getting
up
to
start
early
on
the
long
walk
her
mother
would
get
up
too
and
that
was
foolish
she
saw
the
slight
figure
stooping
to
rake
together
the
embers
in
the
broad
chimney
throat
that
the
might
be
set
on
she
remonstrated
with
the
little
mother
saying
that
she
aimed
not
to
disturb
anybody
not
even
uncle
pros
uncle
pros
laurella
echoed
from
the
hearthstone
where
she
sat
on
her
heels
like
a
little
girl
playing
at
johnnie
smiled
at
the
memory
of
how
her
mother
laughed
over
the
suggestion
with
a
drawing
of
slant
brows
above
big
tragic
dark
eyes
a
look
of
suffering
from
the
mirth
which
adds
the
crown
to
joyousness
your
uncle
pros
he
got
a
revelation
midnight
as
to
just
whar
that
thar
silver
mine
is
that
been
dodgin
him
for
more
forty
year
he
come
me
by
the
shoulder
like
i
reckon
he
done
fifty
times
ef
he
done
it
once
and
telling
me
that
he
off
to
make
all
our
fortunes
inside
of
a
week
he
said
if
you
still
would
go
down
to
that
thar
old
fool
cotton
mill
and
hire
out
to
name
it
to
you
that
shade
buckheath
would
stand
some
watchin
your
uncle
pros
has
got
sense
in
streaks
why
in
the
world
you
pike
out
and
go
to
work
in
a
cotton
mill
is
more
than
i
can
cipher
to
take
care
of
you
and
the
children
the
girl
had
said
standing
tall
and
straight
and
laughing
back
at
her
little
mother
somebody
got
to
take
care
of
and
i
just
love
to
be
the
one
laurella
consadine
commonly
called
in
mountain
fashion
by
her
maiden
name
of
laurella
passmore
scrambled
to
her
feet
and
tossed
the
dark
curls
out
of
her
eyes
aw
law
huh
she
returned
carelessly
we
get
along
we
always
have
how
do
you
reckon
i
made
out
before
you
was
born
you
great
big
somebody
what
the
matter
with
you
did
you
fail
to
borry
a
frock
for
the
dance
over
at
rainy
gap
try
again
honey
i
bet
buckheath
would
lend
you
one
o
that
was
it
borrowing
borrowing
borrowing
till
they
were
known
as
the
borrowing
passmores
and
became
the
jest
of
the
neighbourhood
no
i
could
stand
it
the
girl
justified
herself
i
had
obliged
to
get
out
and
go
where
money
could
be
earned
me
that
big
and
stout
and
able
and
sighingly
yet
for
with
laurella
consadine
and
johnnie
there
was
always
the
quaint
suggestion
of
a
little
girl
with
a
doll
quite
too
big
for
her
the
mother
let
her
go
it
had
been
just
so
when
johnnie
would
have
her
time
for
every
term
of
the
old
field
hollerin
school
where
she
learned
to
read
and
write
even
when
she
persisted
in
going
to
rainy
gap
where
some
charitably
inclined
northern
church
maintained
a
little
school
and
pushed
her
education
to
dizzy
heights
that
to
mountain
vision
appeared
plumb
foolish
that
morning
she
had
cautioned
her
mother
to
be
careful
lest
they
waken
the
children
for
if
the
little
ones
roused
and
began
as
the
mountain
phrase
has
it
takin
on
she
scarcely
knew
how
she
should
find
heart
to
leave
them
the
children
there
was
the
thing
that
drove
four
small
brothers
and
sisters
there
were
with
little
deanie
the
youngest
to
make
the
painfully
strong
plea
of
recent
babyhood
consadine
who
never
could
earn
money
and
used
to
be
from
home
following
one
wild
scheme
or
another
most
of
the
time
was
gone
these
two
years
upon
his
last
dubious
adventurous
journey
there
was
not
even
his
intermittent
assistance
to
depend
upon
johnnie
was
the
man
of
the
family
and
she
shouldered
her
burden
bravely
declaring
to
herself
that
she
would
yet
have
a
chance
which
the
little
ones
could
share
she
had
kissed
her
mother
picked
up
her
bundle
and
got
as
far
as
the
door
when
there
came
a
spat
of
bare
feet
meeting
the
floor
a
pattering
rush
and
deanie
short
arms
went
around
her
knees
almost
tripping
her
up
i
was
i
was
the
whole
time
whispered
the
baby
lifting
a
warm
pursed
mouth
for
a
kiss
deanie
be
good
an
let
you
go
sis
johnnie
an
then
when
you
get
down
thar
whar
it
all
so
sightly
you
send
for
deanie
deed
and
double
you
live
without
her
now
could
ye
and
she
looked
craftily
up
into
the
face
bent
above
her
bravely
choking
back
the
tears
that
wanted
to
drown
her
long
speech
johnnie
dropped
her
bundle
and
caught
up
the
child
crushing
the
warm
soft
yielding
little
form
against
her
breast
in
a
very
passion
of
tenderness
deed
and
double
i
could
she
whispered
back
sister
goin
to
earn
money
and
deanie
shall
have
plenty
of
good
things
to
eat
next
winter
and
some
shoes
she
sha
be
housed
up
every
time
it
snows
sis
goin
to
she
broke
off
abruptly
and
kissed
the
small
face
with
vehemence
she
managed
to
whisper
as
she
set
the
baby
down
and
turned
to
her
mother
the
kindling
touch
of
that
farewell
warmed
her
resolution
yet
she
was
not
going
down
to
cottonville
to
work
in
the
mill
merely
she
was
going
into
the
storehouse
of
possibilities
to
find
and
buy
a
chance
in
the
world
for
these
poor
little
souls
who
could
never
have
it
otherwise
before
she
kissed
her
mother
took
up
her
bundle
and
trudged
away
in
the
chill
gray
dawn
she
declared
an
intention
to
come
home
and
pay
back
every
one
to
whom
they
were
under
obligations
now
her
face
dimpled
as
she
remembered
the
shriek
of
dismay
laurella
sent
after
her
good
land
johnnie
consadine
if
you
start
in
to
pay
off
all
the
borryin
of
the
passmore
family
since
you
was
born
you
ruin
us
that
what
you
do
you
ruin
us
these
things
acted
themselves
over
and
over
in
johnnie
mind
as
throughout
the
fresh
april
afternoon
her
long
free
rhythmic
step
its
morning
vigour
undiminished
swung
the
miles
behind
her
still
present
in
thought
when
away
down
in
render
gap
she
settled
herself
on
a
rock
by
the
wayside
where
a
little
stream
crossed
the
road
to
wash
her
feet
and
put
on
the
shoes
which
she
had
up
to
this
time
carried
with
her
bundle
i
reckon
i
must
be
near
enough
town
to
need
she
said
regretfully
as
she
drew
the
big
shapeless
cowhide
affairs
on
her
slim
brown
carefully
washed
and
dried
feet
and
with
a
leathern
thong
laced
down
a
wide
stiff
tongue
she
had
earned
the
money
for
these
shoes
picking
blackberries
at
ten
cents
the
gallon
and
uncle
pros
had
bought
them
at
the
store
at
bledsoe
according
to
his
own
ideas
get
big
enough
and
there
wo
be
any
fussin
about
the
fit
the
old
man
explained
his
theory
and
indeed
the
fit
of
those
shoes
on
johnnie
feet
was
not
a
thing
to
fuss
over
it
was
past
considering
the
sun
was
westering
the
gap
began
to
be
in
shadow
although
the
point
at
which
she
sat
was
well
above
the
valley
the
girl
was
all
at
once
aware
that
she
was
tired
and
a
little
timid
of
what
lay
before
her
she
had
written
to
shade
buckheath
a
neighbour
boy
with
whom
she
had
gone
to
school
now
employed
as
a
mechanic
or
in
one
of
the
cotton
mills
and
from
whom
she
had
received
a
reply
saying
that
she
could
get
work
in
cottonville
if
she
would
come
down
mavity
bence
who
had
given
johnnie
her
first
clothes
was
a
weaver
in
the
hardwick
mill
at
cottonville
watauga
milling
suburb
her
father
gideon
himes
with
whom
shade
buckheath
learned
his
trade
was
a
skilled
mechanic
and
had
worked
as
a
for
a
while
at
present
he
was
keeping
a
for
the
hands
and
it
was
here
johnnie
was
to
find
lodging
shade
himself
was
reported
to
be
doing
extremely
well
he
had
promised
in
his
letter
that
if
johnnie
came
on
a
sunday
evening
he
would
walk
up
the
road
a
piece
and
meet
her
she
now
began
to
hope
that
he
would
come
then
waiting
for
him
she
forgot
him
and
set
herself
to
imagine
what
work
in
the
cotton
mill
and
life
in
town
would
be
like
to
shade
buckheath
strolling
up
the
road
in
the
expansiveness
of
his
holiday
mood
and
the
dignity
of
his
sunday
suit
the
first
sight
of
johnnie
came
with
a
little
unwelcome
shock
he
had
left
her
in
the
mountains
a
tall
thin
girl
in
the
growing
age
he
got
his
first
sight
of
her
profile
relieved
against
the
green
of
the
wayside
bank
with
a
bunch
of
blooming
azaleas
starring
its
verdure
behind
her
bright
head
he
was
not
artist
enough
to
appreciate
the
picture
at
its
value
he
simply
had
the
sudden
resentful
feeling
of
one
who
has
asked
for
a
hen
and
been
offered
a
bird
of
paradise
she
was
tall
and
lithe
and
strong
her
thick
fair
hair
without
being
actually
curly
seemed
to
be
so
vehemently
alive
that
it
rippled
a
bit
in
its
length
as
a
brook
does
over
a
stone
it
rose
up
around
her
brow
in
a
roll
that
was
almost
the
fashionable
coiffure
those
among
whom
she
had
been
bred
laconically
called
the
colour
red
but
in
fact
it
was
only
too
deep
a
gold
to
be
quite
yellow
johnnie
face
even
in
repose
was
always
potentially
joyous
the
clear
wide
gray
eyes
under
their
arching
brows
the
mobile
lips
held
as
it
were
the
smile
in
solution
when
one
addressed
her
it
broke
swiftly
into
being
the
pink
lips
lifting
adorably
above
the
white
teeth
the
long
fringed
eyes
crinkling
deliciously
about
the
corners
johnnie
loved
to
laugh
and
the
heart
of
any
reasonable
being
was
instantly
moved
to
give
her
cause
for
himself
the
young
man
was
a
prevalent
type
among
his
people
brown
well
built
light
on
his
feet
with
heavy
black
hair
growing
low
on
his
forehead
and
long
eyes
there
was
something
latin
in
the
grace
of
his
movements
and
in
his
glance
life
ran
strong
in
shade
buckheath
he
stepped
with
an
independent
stride
that
was
almost
a
swagger
and
already
felt
himself
a
successful
man
but
that
one
of
the
tribe
of
borrowing
passmores
should
presume
to
such
opulence
of
charm
struck
him
as
impudent
the
pure
outlines
of
features
their
aristocratic
mould
the
ruddy
gold
of
her
rich
clustering
hair
those
were
things
it
seemed
to
him
a
good
might
well
have
dispensed
with
then
the
girl
turned
saw
him
and
flashed
him
a
swift
smile
of
greeting
it
mighty
kind
of
you
to
come
up
and
meet
me
she
said
getting
to
her
feet
a
little
awkwardly
on
account
of
the
shoes
and
picking
up
her
bundle
i
you
might
get
lost
bantered
the
young
fellow
not
offering
to
carry
the
packet
as
they
trudged
away
side
by
side
how
everybody
back
on
unaka
has
your
uncle
pros
found
his
silver
mine
yet
no
returned
johnnie
seriously
but
he
lookin
for
it
shade
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
so
long
and
loud
that
it
would
have
been
embarrassing
to
any
one
less
sound
and
than
this
girl
i
reckon
he
is
said
buckheath
i
reckon
pros
passmore
will
be
lookin
for
that
silver
mine
when
gabriel
blows
it
runs
in
the
family
do
it
johnnie
looked
at
him
and
shook
her
head
you
been
learnin
town
ways
have
you
she
asked
simply
you
mean
my
makin
game
of
the
passmores
he
inquired
coolly
no
i
never
learned
that
in
the
settlement
i
learned
it
in
the
mountains
i
just
forgot
your
name
was
passmore
that
all
he
added
sarcastically
are
you
goin
to
get
mad
about
it
johnnie
had
put
on
her
slat
sunbonnet
and
pulled
it
down
so
he
could
not
see
her
face
no
she
returned
evenly
i
not
goin
to
get
mad
at
anything
and
my
name
not
passmore
either
my
name
is
consadine
and
i
aim
to
be
called
that
uncle
pros
passmore
is
my
mother
uncle
and
one
of
the
best
men
that
ever
lived
i
reckon
if
all
the
folks
he
nursed
in
sickness
or
laid
out
in
death
was
numbered
over
it
would
be
a
one
and
i
never
heard
him
take
any
credit
to
himself
for
anything
he
did
why
shade
the
last
three
years
of
your
father
life
uncle
pros
did
dare
hunt
his
silver
mine
much
because
your
father
was
paralysed
and
had
to
have
close
waitin
on
and
and
there
was
nobody
but
uncle
pros
since
all
his
boys
was
gone
and
oh
say
it
speak
out
urged
shade
hardily
you
mean
that
all
us
chaps
had
cut
out
and
left
the
old
man
and
there
was
a
cent
of
money
to
pay
anybody
and
no
one
but
pros
passmore
would
been
fool
enough
to
do
such
hard
work
without
pay
well
i
reckon
you
about
right
you
and
me
come
of
a
mighty
poor
nation
of
folks
but
i
goin
to
make
my
pile
and
have
my
share
if
lookin
out
for
number
one
do
it
johnnie
turned
and
regarded
him
curiously
it
was
characteristic
of
the
mountain
girl
and
of
her
people
that
she
had
not
on
first
meeting
stared
village
fashion
at
his
brave
attire
and
she
seemed
now
concerned
only
with
the
man
himself
i
reckon
you
get
it
she
said
meditatively
i
reckon
you
will
sometimes
i
think
we
always
get
just
what
we
deserve
in
this
here
world
and
that
the
only
safe
way
is
to
try
to
deserve
something
good
i
hope
i
did
say
too
much
for
uncle
pros
but
he
so
easy
and
himself
that
i
just
could
bear
to
hear
you
laughin
at
him
and
not
answer
you
i
declare
you
plenty
funny
buckheath
burst
put
boisterously
no
i
ai
mad
at
you
i
kind
o
like
you
for
stickin
up
for
the
old
man
you
and
me
get
along
i
reckon
as
they
moved
forward
the
man
and
the
girl
fell
into
more
general
chat
the
feeling
of
irritation
at
johnnie
beauty
her
superior
air
growing
rather
than
diminishing
in
the
young
fellow
mind
how
dare
pros
passmore
grandniece
carry
a
bright
head
so
high
and
flash
such
glances
of
liquid
fire
at
her
questioner
shade
looked
sidewise
sometimes
at
his
companion
as
he
asked
the
news
of
their
mutual
friends
and
she
answered
yet
when
he
got
along
with
her
mild
responses
one
of
those
glances
he
was
himself
strangely
subdued
by
it
and
fain
to
prop
his
leaning
prejudices
by
contrasting
her
scant
print
gown
her
slat
sunbonnet
and
cowhide
shoes
with
the
apparel
of
the
humblest
in
the
village
which
they
were
approaching
chapter
iii
a
peak
in
darien
so
walking
and
so
desultorily
talking
they
came
out
on
a
noble
white
highway
that
wound
for
miles
along
the
bluffy
edge
of
the
upland
overlooking
the
valley
upon
the
one
side
fronted
by
handsome
residences
on
the
other
it
was
johnnie
first
view
of
a
big
valley
a
river
or
a
city
she
had
seen
the
shoestring
creek
bottoms
between
the
endless
mountains
among
which
she
was
born
and
bred
the
depressions
of
their
inner
fastnesses
she
was
used
to
the
cool
clear
mountain
creeks
that
fight
their
way
down
those
steeps
like
an
armed
man
beating
off
assailants
at
every
turn
she
had
been
taken
a
number
of
times
to
bledsoe
the
tiny
settlement
at
the
foot
of
unaka
old
bald
where
there
were
two
stores
a
blacksmith
shop
the
and
the
church
below
her
now
beginning
to
glow
in
the
evening
light
opened
out
one
of
the
finest
valleys
of
the
southern
appalachees
lapped
in
it
far
off
shrouded
with
rosy
mist
which
she
did
not
identify
as
transmuted
coal
smoke
a
city
lay
fretted
with
spires
already
sparkling
with
electric
lights
set
like
a
glittering
boss
of
jewels
in
the
broad
curve
of
a
shining
river
directly
down
the
steep
at
their
feet
was
the
town
a
suburb
clustered
about
a
great
factories
whose
long
rows
of
lighted
windows
defined
their
black
bulk
there
was
a
stream
here
too
a
small
sluggish
thing
that
flowed
from
tank
to
tank
among
the
factories
spanned
by
numerous
handrails
bridged
in
one
place
for
the
to
cross
mills
valley
town
distant
rimming
mountains
river
and
creek
glowed
and
pulsed
dissolved
and
relimned
themselves
in
the
uprolling
glory
of
sunset
oh
wait
for
me
a
minute
shade
pleaded
the
girl
pulling
off
her
sunbonnet
i
want
to
look
never
in
my
life
did
i
see
anything
so
sightly
good
land
laughed
the
man
with
a
note
of
impatience
in
his
voice
you
and
me
was
raised
on
mountain
scenery
as
a
body
may
say
i
should
think
we
both
had
enough
of
it
to
last
us
but
this
this
is
different
groped
johnnie
trying
to
explain
the
emotions
that
possessed
her
look
at
that
big
settlement
over
yon
i
reckon
it
a
city
it
must
be
watauga
it
looks
like
the
the
mansions
of
the
blest
in
the
big
bible
that
preacher
drane
has
down
at
bledsoe
i
reckon
they
blest
they
got
plenty
of
money
returned
shade
with
the
cheap
cynicism
of
his
kind
so
many
houses
the
girl
communed
with
herself
there
bound
to
be
a
person
in
all
them
houses
she
went
on
one
could
read
the
loving
outreach
to
all
humanity
in
her
tones
there
is
put
in
shade
caustically
there
many
a
rogue
you
want
to
look
out
for
them
tricky
town
folks
a
girl
like
you
had
he
been
more
kind
he
would
have
said
a
pretty
girl
like
you
but
johnnie
did
not
miss
it
she
was
used
to
such
as
he
gave
or
less
come
on
he
urged
impatiently
we
wo
get
no
supper
if
you
hurry
supper
johnnie
drew
in
her
breath
and
shook
her
head
with
that
scene
unrolled
there
as
though
all
the
kingdoms
of
earth
were
spread
before
them
to
look
upon
she
was
asked
to
remember
supper
sighing
but
submissively
she
moved
to
follow
her
guide
a
reluctant
glance
across
her
shoulder
when
there
came
a
cry
something
like
that
which
the
wild
geese
make
when
they
come
over
in
the
spring
and
a
thing
with
two
shining
fiery
eyes
a
thing
that
purred
like
a
giant
cat
rounded
a
curve
in
the
road
and
came
to
a
sudden
jolting
halt
beside
them
shade
stopped
immediately
for
that
johnnie
did
not
fail
to
recognize
the
vehicle
illustrated
magazines
go
everywhere
in
these
days
in
the
automobile
rode
a
man
dressed
in
a
suit
of
white
flannels
strange
to
johnnie
eyes
beside
him
sat
a
woman
in
a
long
shimmering
silken
cloak
a
great
misty
veil
twined
round
head
and
hat
and
tied
in
a
big
bow
under
the
chin
johnnie
had
as
yet
seen
nothing
more
pretentious
than
the
starched
and
ruffled
flummeries
of
a
small
mountain
this
beautiful
peculiar
looking
garb
had
something
of
the
picturesque
the
poetic
about
it
that
appealed
to
her
as
the
frocks
worn
at
chalybeate
springs
or
bledsoe
had
never
done
she
had
not
wanted
them
she
wanted
this
the
automobile
was
stopped
the
young
fellow
in
it
calling
to
shade
i
wonder
if
you
could
help
me
with
this
thing
buckheath
it
on
a
strike
again
show
me
what
you
did
to
it
last
time
along
the
edge
of
the
road
at
this
point
for
safety
sake
a
low
stone
wall
had
been
laid
setting
down
her
bundle
johnnie
leaned
upon
this
and
shared
her
admiration
between
the
valley
below
and
these
beautiful
interesting
newcomers
her
bonnet
was
pushed
far
back
the
wind
ruffled
the
bright
hair
about
her
forehead
the
wonder
and
glory
and
delight
of
it
all
made
her
deep
eyes
shine
with
a
child
curiosity
and
avid
wishfulness
her
lips
were
parted
in
unconscious
smiles
white
and
red
tremulous
on
tiptoe
the
eager
soul
looking
out
of
her
face
she
was
very
beautiful
the
man
in
the
automobile
observed
her
kindly
the
woman
features
she
could
not
quite
see
though
the
veil
was
parted
neither
johnnie
nor
the
driver
of
the
car
saw
the
quick
resentful
glance
her
companion
shot
at
the
city
man
as
shade
noted
the
admiring
look
at
the
girl
buckheath
displayed
an
awesome
familiarity
with
the
machine
and
its
workings
crawling
under
the
body
and
tapping
it
here
and
there
with
a
wrench
its
driver
supplied
they
backed
it
and
moved
it
a
little
and
seemed
to
be
debating
the
short
turn
which
would
take
them
into
the
driveway
leading
up
to
a
house
on
the
slope
above
the
road
johnnie
continued
to
watch
with
fascinated
eyes
shade
was
on
his
feet
now
reaching
into
the
bowels
of
the
machine
to
do
mysterious
things
it
a
broken
connection
he
announced
briefly
is
the
wire
too
short
to
twist
together
inquired
the
man
in
the
car
will
you
have
to
put
in
a
new
piece
assented
buckheath
there
a
wire
in
that
box
there
directed
the
other
shade
worked
in
silence
for
a
moment
now
she
go
i
reckon
he
announced
and
once
more
the
driver
started
up
his
car
it
curved
perilously
near
the
bundle
she
had
set
down
with
the
handkerchief
containing
her
cherished
blossom
lying
atop
the
swept
this
latter
off
and
buckheath
set
a
foot
upon
it
as
he
followed
the
machine
in
its
progress
take
care
that
was
a
flower
the
man
in
the
auto
warned
too
late
shade
answered
with
a
quick
glance
and
a
little
derisive
laugh
but
no
words
the
young
fellow
stopped
the
machine
jumped
down
and
picked
up
the
coarse
little
handkerchief
which
showed
a
bit
of
drooping
green
stem
at
one
end
and
a
glimpse
of
pink
at
the
other
i
sorry
he
said
presenting
it
to
johnnie
with
exactly
the
air
and
tone
he
had
used
in
speaking
to
the
lady
who
was
with
him
in
the
car
if
i
had
seen
it
in
time
i
might
have
saved
it
i
hope
it
not
much
hurt
buckheath
addressed
himself
savagely
to
his
work
at
the
machine
the
woman
in
the
auto
glanced
uneasily
up
at
the
house
on
the
slope
above
them
johnnie
looked
into
the
eyes
bent
so
kindly
upon
her
and
could
have
worshipped
the
ground
on
which
their
owner
trod
kindness
always
melted
her
heart
utterly
but
kindness
with
such
beautiful
courtesy
added
this
was
the
quality
in
flower
it
does
make
any
differ
she
said
softly
turning
to
him
a
rapt
transfigured
face
it
just
a
bloom
i
brought
from
the
mountains
they
do
grow
in
the
valley
and
i
found
this
one
on
my
way
down
the
man
wondered
a
little
if
it
were
only
the
glow
of
the
sunset
that
lit
her
face
with
such
shining
beauty
he
noted
how
the
fires
of
it
flowed
over
her
bright
blown
hair
and
kindled
its
colour
how
it
lingered
in
the
clear
eyes
and
flamed
upon
the
white
neck
and
throat
till
they
had
almost
the
translucence
of
pearl
i
think
this
thing
work
now
for
a
spell
anyhow
shade
voice
sounded
sharply
from
the
road
behind
them
are
you
afraid
to
attempt
it
miss
sessions
the
young
man
called
to
his
companion
if
you
are
we
walk
up
i
telephone
at
the
house
for
a
trap
and
we
drive
back
buckheath
will
take
the
machine
in
for
us
the
voice
was
even
and
yet
every
word
came
to
johnnie
distinctly
she
watched
with
a
sort
of
rapture
the
movements
of
this
party
the
man
hair
was
dark
and
crisp
and
worn
a
little
long
about
the
temples
and
ears
he
had
pleasant
dark
eyes
and
an
air
of
being
slightly
amused
even
when
he
did
not
smile
the
lady
apparently
said
that
she
was
not
afraid
for
her
companion
got
in
the
machine
negotiated
the
turn
safely
and
began
to
move
slowly
up
the
steep
ascent
as
it
did
so
the
driver
gave
another
glance
toward
where
the
mountain
girl
stood
a
swift
kind
glance
and
a
smile
that
stayed
with
her
after
the
shining
car
had
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
building
where
people
were
laughing
and
calling
to
each
other
and
moving
about
people
dressed
in
beautiful
garments
which
johnnie
would
fain
have
inspected
more
closely
buckheath
stood
gazing
at
her
sarcastically
come
on
he
ordered
as
she
held
back
lingering
they
ai
no
good
in
you
hangin
here
that
was
gray
stoddard
and
the
lady
he
beauin
is
miss
lydia
sessions
hardwick
for
such
as
her
not
for
you
he
the
boss
of
the
bosses
down
at
cottonville
no
use
of
you
lookin
at
him
johnnie
scarcely
heard
the
words
her
eyes
were
on
the
wide
porch
of
the
house
above
them
what
is
that
place
she
inquired
in
an
awestruck
whisper
as
she
fell
into
step
submissively
plodding
with
bent
head
at
his
shoulder
the
country
club
shade
flung
back
at
her
did
you
it
was
heaven
heaven
johnnie
brooded
on
that
for
a
long
time
she
turned
her
head
stealthily
for
a
last
glimpse
of
the
portico
where
a
laughing
girl
tossed
a
ball
to
a
young
fellow
on
the
terrace
below
after
all
heaven
was
not
so
far
amiss
she
had
rather
associated
it
with
the
abode
of
the
blest
the
people
in
it
were
happy
they
moved
in
beautiful
raiment
all
day
long
they
spoke
to
each
other
kindly
it
was
love
home
she
was
sure
of
that
then
her
mind
went
back
to
the
dress
of
the
girl
in
the
auto
i
to
have
me
a
frock
like
that
before
i
die
she
said
half
unconsciously
yet
with
a
sudden
passion
of
resolution
yes
if
i
live
i
to
have
me
just
such
a
frock
shade
wheeled
in
his
tracks
with
a
swift
narrowing
of
the
eyes
he
had
been
more
stirred
than
he
was
willing
to
acknowledge
by
the
girl
beauty
and
by
a
nameless
power
that
went
out
from
the
seemingly
helpless
creature
and
laid
hold
of
those
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
it
was
the
open
admiration
of
young
stoddard
which
had
roused
the
sullen
resentment
he
was
now
spending
on
her
ye
air
air
ye
he
demanded
sharply
you
to
have
a
frock
like
that
and
what
man
to
pay
for
it
i
like
to
know
such
talk
belonged
to
the
valley
and
the
settlement
in
the
mountains
a
woman
works
of
course
and
earns
her
board
and
keep
she
is
a
valuable
industrial
possession
or
chattel
to
the
man
who
may
profit
by
her
labour
never
a
luxury
a
bill
of
expense
as
she
walked
johnnie
nodded
toward
the
factory
in
the
valley
beginning
to
blaze
with
light
her
bridge
of
toil
that
was
to
carry
her
from
the
island
of
nowhere
to
the
great
mainland
of
life
where
everything
might
be
had
for
the
working
the
striving
i
did
name
no
man
she
said
mildly
i
do
reckon
anybody
to
give
me
things
ai
there
the
factory
where
a
body
may
work
and
earn
money
for
all
they
need
well
i
reckon
they
might
if
they
was
good
and
careful
to
need
powerful
little
allowed
shade
at
the
moment
they
came
to
the
opening
of
a
small
path
which
plunged
abruptly
down
the
steep
side
of
the
ridge
curving
in
and
out
with
and
sometimes
across
a
carriage
road
as
they
took
the
first
steps
on
this
the
sun
forsook
the
valley
at
last
and
lingered
only
on
the
mountain
top
where
was
that
palace
of
pleasure
into
which
he
and
she
had
vanished
before
which
the
strange
chariot
waited
and
all
at
once
the
little
brook
that
wound
a
golden
thread
between
the
bulk
of
the
mills
flowed
a
stream
of
ink
from
pool
to
pool
of
black
water
the
way
down
turned
and
turned
and
each
time
that
shade
and
johnnie
got
another
sight
of
the
buildings
of
the
little
village
below
they
had
changed
in
character
with
the
changing
point
of
view
they
loomed
taller
they
looked
darker
in
spite
of
the
pulsing
light
from
their
many
windows
and
now
there
burst
out
a
roar
of
whistles
like
the
bellowing
of
great
monsters
somehow
it
struck
cold
upon
the
girl
heart
they
were
coming
down
from
that
wonderful
highland
where
she
had
seemed
to
see
all
the
kingdoms
of
earth
spread
before
her
hers
for
the
conquering
they
were
descending
into
the
shadow
as
they
came
quite
to
the
foot
they
saw
groups
of
women
and
children
with
here
and
there
a
decrepit
man
leaving
the
cottages
and
making
their
way
toward
the
lighted
mills
from
the
doors
of
little
shanties
women
with
boys
and
girls
walking
near
them
and
in
one
or
two
cases
very
small
ones
clinging
to
their
skirts
and
hands
reinforced
the
crowd
which
set
in
a
steady
stream
toward
the
bridges
and
the
open
gates
in
the
high
board
fences
what
are
they
to
the
factory
for
on
sunday
evening
johnnie
inquired
night
turn
replied
buckheath
briefly
sunday
over
at
sundown
oh
yes
agreed
johnnie
dutifully
but
rather
disheartened
trade
must
be
mighty
good
if
they
have
to
work
all
night
them
that
works
do
get
any
more
for
it
retorted
shade
harshly
what
the
little
ones
goin
to
the
mill
for
johnnie
questioned
staring
up
at
him
with
apprehensive
eyes
why
to
play

reckon
returned
the
young
fellow
ironically
folks
mostly
does
go
to
the
mill
to
play
do
they
the
girl
ran
forward
and
clasped
his
arm
with
eager
fingers
that
shook
shade
she
cried
they
ca
work
those
little
babies
that
one
over
there
ai
to
exceed
four
year
old
and
i
know
it
the
man
looked
indifferently
to
where
a
tiny
boy
trotted
at
his
heels
solemn
unchildish
he
laughed
a
little
that
thar
chap
is
the
oldest
feller
in
the
mills
he
said
benny
tarbox
he
too
short
to

she
pulled
the
sunbonnet
about
her
face
the
gold
was
all
gone
from
the
earth
and
from
her
mood
as
well
she
raised
her
eyes
to
where
the
last
brightness
lingered
on
the
up
there
they
were
happy
and
even
as
her
feet
carried
her
forward
to
pap
her
soul
went
clamouring
questing
back
toward
the
heights
and
the
sunlight
the
love
and
laughter
she
had
left
behind
the
power
and
the
glory
the
power
and
the
glory
she
whispered
over
and
over
to
herself
is
it
all
back
there
again
she
looked
wistfully
toward
the
heights
but
maybe
a
body
with
two
feet
can
climb
chapter
iv
of
the
use
of
feet
the
suburb
of
cottonville
bordered
a
creek
a
starveling
stream
which
offered
the
sole
suggestion
of
sewerage
the
village
was
cut
in
two
by
this
natural
division
it
clung
to
the
shelving
sides
of
the
shallow
ravine
it
was
scattered
like
bits
of
refuse
on
the
numerous
railroad
embankments
where
building
was
unhandy
and
streets
almost
impossible
to
be
convenient
to
the
mills
six
big
factories
in
all
some
on
one
side
of
the
state
line
and
some
on
the
other
daily
breathed
in
their
live
current
of
operatives
and
exhaled
them
again
to
fill
the
litter
of
flimsy
shanties
the
road
which
wound
down
from
the
heights
ran
through
the
middle
of
the
village
and
formed
its
main
street
across
the
ravine
from
it
reached
by
a
wooden
bridge
stood
a
pretentious
frame
edifice
a
built
by
the
gloriana
mill
for
the
use
of
its
office
force
and
mechanics
men
were
lounging
on
the
wide
porches
of
this
structure
in
leisure
smoking
and
singing
the
young
southern
male
of
any
class
is
usually
melodious
across
the
hollow
came
the
sounds
of
a
guitar
and
a
harmonica
listen
a
minute
shade
ai
that
pretty
i
know
that
tune
said
johnnie
and
she
began
to
hum
softly
under
her
breath
her
girlish
heart
responding
to
the
call
hush
admonished
buckheath
harshly
you
do
want
to
be
after
them
fellers
it
some
of
the
in
silence
he
led
the
way
past
the
great
mill
buildings
of
red
brick
square
and
unlovely
but
and
glowing
alight
throbbing
with
the
hum
of
pent
industry
johnnie
gazed
steadily
up
at
those
windows
the
glow
within
was
other
than
that
which
gilded
turret
and
pinnacle
and
fairy
isle
in
the
western
sky
yet
perchance
this
light
might
be
a
lamp
to
the
feet
of
one
who
wished
to
climb
that
way
her
adventurous
spirit
rose
to
the
challenge
and
she
said
softly
more
to
herself
than
to
the
man
i
to
be
a
boss
hand
in
there
i
goin
to
get
the
highest
wages
of
any
girl
in
the
mill
time
i
learn
my
trade
because
i
to
try
harder
anybody
shade
looked
around
at
her
curiously
her
beauty
her
air
of
superiority
still
repelled
him
such
fancy
articles
were
not
apt
to
be
of
much
use
but
this
sounded
like
a
woman
who
might
be
valuable
to
her
master
johnnie
returned
his
gaze
with
the
frank
good
will
of
a
child
and
suddenly
he
forgot
everything
but
the
adorable
lift
of
her
pink
lip
over
the
shining
white
teeth
the
young
fellow
now
halted
at
the
step
of
a
big
frame
house
the
outside
was
of
an
extent
to
seem
fairly
pretentious
yet
so
mean
was
the
construction
so
sparing
of
window
and
finish
that
the
building
showed
itself
instantly
for
what
it
was
the
cheap
of
a
mill
town
a
group
of
girls
sitting
on
the
step
in
blessed
sunday
idleness
and
cheap
sunday
finery
stared
as
he
and
johnnie
ascended
and
crossed
the
porch
one
of
these
a
tall
lank
woman
of
perhaps
thirty
years
got
up
and
followed
a
few
hesitating
paces
apparently
more
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
than
with
any
hospitable
intent
a
man
with
a
round
red
face
and
a
bald
pate
whose
curly
fringe
of
grizzled
reddish
hair
made
him
look
like
a
clown
in
a
pantomime
motioned
them
with
a
surly
thumb
toward
the
back
of
the
house
where
clattering
preparations
for
supper
were
audible
and
odoriferous
the
old
fellow
sat
in
a
chair
of
extra
size
and
with
arms
this
he
had
kicked
back
against
the
wall
of
the
house
so
that
his
short
legs
did
not
reach
the
floor
the
big
feet
finding
rest
on
the
rung
of
the
chair
his
attitude
was
one
of
relaxation
the
face
broad
flat
small
of
eye
and
wide
of
mouth
did
indeed
suggest
the
clown
countenance
yet
there
was
in
it
and
in
the
whole
personality
something
of
the
eastern
idol
the
journeyman
attempt
of
crude
humanity
to
represent
power
and
the
potential
cruelty
of
the
type
slept
in
his
placid
countenance
as
surely
as
ever
in
the
dreaming
face
of
shiva
the
destroyer
bence
aunt
mavity
called
shade
advancing
into
the
narrow
hall
in
answer
a
woman
came
from
the
kitchen
wiping
her
hands
on
her
checked
apron
good
lord
if
it
ai
johnnie
i
was
she
would
git
here
she
ejaculated
when
she
saw
the
girl
take
her
out
on
the
porch
shade
i
ai
got
a
minute
now
pap
poorly
again
and
obliged
to
put
the
late
supper
on
the
table
for
them
thar
gals
the
night
shift
done
eat
and
gone
i
show
her
whar
she
to
sleep
at
after
while
i
do
just
rightly
know
whar
pap
aimed
to
have
her
stay
she
concluded
hastily
as
something
boiled
over
on
the
stove
johnnie
set
her
bundle
down
in
the
corner
of
the
kitchen
i
help
she
said
simply
as
she
drew
the
excited
to
a
corner
of
the
range
and
dosed
it
judiciously
with
cold
water
well
now
that
mighty
good
of
you
panted
worried
mavity
bence
how
queer
things
comes
she
ruminated
as
they
dished
up
the
biscuits
and
fried
pork
i
helped
you
into
the
very
world
johnnie
i
lived
neighbour
to
your
maw
and
they
was
nobody
else
to
be
with
her
when
you
was
born
and
i
went
over
i
never
suspicioned
that
you
would
be
helpin
me
git
supper
down
here
in
the
settlement
inside
twenty
year
johnnie
ran
and
fetched
and
carried
as
though
she
had
never
done
anything
else
in
her
life
intent
on
the
one
task
she
was
alive
in
every
fibre
of
her
young
body
she
saw
she
heard
as
these
words
can
not
always
be
truthfully
applied
to
people
did
shade
tell
you
anything
about
louvania
inquired
the
woman
at
length
no
replied
johnnie
softly
but
i
seen
it
in
the
paper
louvania
bence
the
only
remaining
child
of
the
widow
had
two
weeks
before
left
her
work
at
the
mill
taken
the
trolley
in
to
watauga
walked
out
upon
the
county
bridge
across
the
tennessee
and
jumped
off
johnnie
had
read
the
published
account
passed
from
hand
to
hand
in
the
mountains
where
pap
himes
and
mavity
bence
had
troops
of
kin
and
where
louvania
was
born
the
statement
ran
that
there
was
no
love
affair
and
that
the
girl
distaste
for
her
work
at
the
cotton
mill
must
have
been
the
reason
for
the
suicide
that
there
talk
in
the
newspaper
was
right
louvania
mother
choked
they
was
a
word
of
truth
in
it
you
know
in
reason
that
if
louvany
hated
to
work
in
the
mill
as
bad
as
all
that
she
have
named
it
to
me
her
own
mother
and
she
never
did
she
never
spoke
a
word
like
it
only
to
say
now
and
as
we
all
do
that
it
was
hard
and
that
she
well
she
did
she
ruther
be
dead
as
gals
will
but
she
could
have
meant
it
do
you
think
she
could
have
meant
it
johnnie
the
faded
eyes
clouded
now
by
tears
stared
up
into
johnnie
clear
young
orbs
of
course
she
could
have
meant
it
johnnie
comforted
her
why
sure
it
fine
to
work
in
the
mill
if
she
did
feel
so
she
have
told
you
the
thing
she
must
have
been
out
of
her
mind
people
always
are
when
they
do
that
that
what
i
keep
the
poor
mother
said
clinging
pathetically
to
that
which
gave
her
consolation
and
cheer
i
say
to
myself
that
it
must
have
been
some
brain
disease
took
her
all
of
a
sudden
and
made
her
crazy
because
god
knows
she
had
nothing
to
fret
her
nor
drive
her
to
such
by
this
time
the
meal
was
on
the
table
and
the
girls
trooped
in
from
the
porch
the
old
man
with
the
bald
pate
was
seating
himself
at
the
head
of
the
board
and
johnnie
asked
the
privilege
of
helping
wait
on
table
no
you
ai
to
bence
said
hospitably
pushing
her
into
a
seat
if
you
start
in
to
work
in
the
morning
like
i
reckon
you
will
you
ai
got
no
other
time
to
get
acquainted
with
the
gals
but
right
now
you
set
down
we
do
take
much
waitin
on
we
all
pass
things
and
reach
for
what
we
want
in
the
smoky
illumination
of
the
two
lamps
which
stood
one
at
each
end
of
the
table
johnnie
fair
face
shone
out
like
a
star
the
tall
woman
who
had
shown
a
faint
interest
in
them
on
the
porch
was
seated
just
opposite
her
bulging
eyes
scarcely
left
the
newcomer
countenance
as
she
filled
her
mouth
she
was
a
scant
creature
despite
her
height
the
narrow
back
was
hooped
like
that
of
an
old
woman
and
the
shoulders
indrawn
so
that
the
chest
was
cramped
and
sent
forth
a
wheezy
flatted
voice
that
sorted
ill
with
her
inches
her
round
eyes
had
no
speculation
in
them
her
short
chin
was
obstinate
without
power
the
thin
hair
that
wanted
to
curl
feebly
about
her
lined
forehead
was
stripped
away
and
twisted
in
a
knot
no
bigger
than
a
walnut
at
the
back
of
a
bent
head
for
some
time
the
old
man
at
the
end
of
the
table
stowed
himself
methodically
with
victuals
his
air
was
that
of
a
man
packing
a
box
then
he
brought
his
implements
to
as
it
were
and
gave
a
divided
attention
to
the
new
boarder
what
did
i
hear
them
call
yo
name
he
inquired
gruffly
johnnie
repeated
her
title
and
gave
him
one
of
those
smiles
that
went
with
most
of
her
speeches
it
seemed
to
suggest
things
to
the
old
sinner
huh
he
grunted
i
riccollect
ye
now
yo
pap
was
a
consadine
but
you
old
virgil
passmore
grandchild
one
of
the
borryin
passmores
he
added
staring
coolly
at
johnnie
virge
was
a
fine
upstandin
old
man
you
got
the
favour
of
him
if
you
was
a
gal
he
evidently
shared
schopenhauer
distaste
for
the
sex
the
girls
about
the
table
were
all
listening
eagerly
johnnie
had
the
sensation
of
a
freshman
who
has
walked
out
on
the
campus
too
well
dressed
virge
was
a
great
beau
in
his
day
continued
pap
reminiscently
he
liked
to
wear
good
clothes
too
i
mind
how
he
borried
abner
weddin
coat
and
wore
it
something
like
ten
year
showed
it
off
fine
it
fitted
him
enough
sight
better
than
it
ever
fitted
little
old
ab
then
he
comes
back
to
wimberly
at
the
end
of
so
long
a
time
with
the
buttons
he
says
says
he
like
that
thar
cloth
yo
coat
was
made
of
was
much
ab
says
he
think
jeeters
cheated
ye
on
it
but
the
buttons
was
good
the
buttons
wore
well
and
them
i
bringin
back
you
may
have
use
for
and
i
have
none
now
the
coat
gone
also
what
i
borry
i
return
as
everybody
knows
that
was
your
granddaddy
there
was
a
tremendous
giggling
about
the
board
as
the
old
man
made
an
end
johnnie
herself
smiled
though
her
face
was
scarlet
she
had
no
words
to
tell
her
tormentor
that
the
borrowing
trait
in
her
tribe
which
had
earned
them
the
name
of
the
borrowing
passmores
proceeded
not
from
avarice
which
ate
into
pap
himes
very
marrow
but
from
its
reverse
trait
of
generosity
she
knew
vaguely
that
they
would
have
shared
with
a
neighbour
their
last
bite
or
dollar
and
had
thus
never
any
doubt
of
being
shared
with
nor
any
shame
in
the
asking
yes
pursued
himes
surveying
johnnie
chucklingly
i
mind
when
you
was
born
has
your
uncle
pros
found
his
silver
mine
yet
my
mother
has
often
told
me
how
good
you
and
bence
was
to
us
when
i
was
little
answered
johnnie
mildly
no
sir
uncle
pros
found
his
silver
mine
yet
but
he
still
for
it
the
reply
appeared
to
delight
himes
he
laughed
immoderately
even
as
buckheath
had
done
i
bet
he
is
he
agreed
pros
passmore
goin
to
hunt
that
there
silver
mine
till
he
finds
another
hole
in
the
ground
about
six
feet
long
and
six
feet
deep
that
what
he
to
do
the
hasty
supper
was
well
under
way
now
bence
brought
the
last
of
the
hot
bread
and
shuffled
into
a
seat
the
old
man
at
the
head
of
the
board
returned
to
his
feeding
but
with
somewhat
moderated
voracity
at
length
pretty
fully
gorged
he
raised
his
head
from
over
his
plate
and
looked
about
him
for
diversion
again
his
attention
was
directed
to
the
new
girl
air
ye
wedded
he
challenged
suddenly
she
shook
her
head
and
laughed
got
your
paigs
sot
for
to
git
any
one
he
followed
up
his
investigations
johnnie
laughed
more
than
ever
and
blushed
again
how
old
air
ye
demanded
her
inquisitor
eighteen
nineteen
good
lord
you
a
old
maid
right
now
well
do
you
let
twenty
go
by
without
gittin
your
hooks
on
a
man
my
experience
is
that
when
a
gal
gits
to
be
twenty
an
ai
wedded
or
got
her
paigs
sot
for
to
wed
she
left
left
he
concluded
impressively
that
quick
smile
of
johnnie
responded
i
reckon
i
do
my
best
she
agreed
reasonably
but
some
folks
can
do
that
and
miss
it
himes
nodded
till
he
set
the
little
red
curls
all
bobbing
around
the
bare
spot
he
approved
i
reckon
that
so
women
is
plenty
and
men
hard
to
git
here
mandy
meacham
been
puttin
in
her
best
licks
for
thirty
year
or
more
an
wo
never
make
it
johnnie
did
not
need
to
be
told
which
one
was
mandy
the
sallow
cheek
of
the
tall
woman
across
from
her
reddened
the
short
chin
wabbled
a
bit
more
than
the
mastication
of
the
biscuit
in
hand
demanded
a
moisture
appeared
in
the
inexpressive
blue
eyes
but
she
managed
a
shaky
laugh
to
assist
the
chorus
which
always
followed
pap
himes
little
jokes
the
old
man
held
a
sort
of
state
among
these
poor
girls
and
took
tribute
of
admiration
as
he
had
taken
tribute
of
life
and
happiness
from
daughter
and
granddaughter
gideon
himes
was
not
actively
a
bad
man
he
was
as
without
personal
malice
as
malaria
when
it
makes
miserable
those
about
it
or
robs
a
girl
of
her
pink
cheeks
her
bright
eyes
her
joy
of
life
wearing
the
elasticity
out
of
her
step
and
making
an
old
woman
of
her
before
her
time
we
do
not
fly
into
a
rage
at
it
we
avoid
it
the
pap
himeses
of
this
world
are
to
be
avoided
if
possible
mandy
stared
at
her
plate
in
mortified
silence
johnnie
wished
she
could
think
of
something
pleasant
to
say
to
the
poor
thing
when
her
attention
was
diverted
by
the
old
man
once
more
addressing
herself
you
look
stout
and
hearty
if
you
learn
to
weave
as
fast
as
you
ort
and
git
so
you
can
tend
five
or
six
looms
i
bet
you
git
a
husband
he
remarked
in
a
burst
of
generosity
i
bet
you
do
and
what
more
i
speak
a
good
word
for
ye
a
gal
that
a
peart
weaver
mighty
apt
to
find
a
man
you
learn
your
looms
if
you
want
to
git
wedded
and
i
know
in
reason
you
do
it
about
all
gals
of
your
age
thinks
of
when
supper
was
over
johnnie
was
a
little
surprised
to
see
the
tall
woman
approach
pap
himes
like
a
small
child
begging
a
favour
of
a
harsh
taskmaster
ca
that
there
new
girl
bunk
with
me
she
inquired
earnestly
i
had
the
intention
to
give
her
louvany
bed
pap
returned
promptly
as
long
as
nobody
with
you
i
reckon
i
do
care
but
if
one
comes
in
you
take
and
she
goes
with
mavity
mind
i
cai
waste
room
poor
as
i
am
piloted
by
the
tall
girl
johnnie
climbed
the
narrow
stair
to
a
long
bare
room
where
a
row
of
double
beds
accommodated
eight
girls
the
couch
she
was
to
occupy
had
been
slept
in
during
the
day
by
a
mill
hand
who
was
on
night
turn
and
it
had
not
been
remade
deftly
johnnie
straightened
and
spread
it
while
her
partner
grumbled
what
the
use
o
doin
that
mandy
inquired
stretching
herself
and
yawning
portentously
we
jist
muss
it
all
up
in
about
two
minutes
when
you
worked
in
a
mill
as
long
as
i
have
you
git
over
the
notion
of
makin
your
bed
for
hit
a
notion
johnnie
laughed
across
her
shoulder
i
just
as
soon
do
it
she
reassured
her
companion
i
do
love
smooth
bedclothes
looks
like
i
dream
better
on
and
under
mandy
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
interfering
considerably
with
the
final
touches
johnnie
was
putting
to
it
you
a
right
good
gal
she
opined
patronizingly
but
foolish
the
new
ones
always
is
foolish
i
can
put
you
up
to
a
thing
help
you
along
though
and
i
willin
to
do
it
again
johnnie
smiled
at
her
that
smile
of
enveloping
sweetness
and
tenderness
it
made
something
down
in
the
left
side
of
poor
slovenly
vibrate
and
tingle
i
thank
you
mightily
said
johnnie
consadine
mightily
and
knew
not
how
true
a
word
she
spoke
you
see
counselled
mandy
from
the
bed
into
which
she
had
rolled
with
most
of
her
clothes
on
you
want
to
get
in
with
miss
lydia
sessions
and
the
uplift
ladies
and
them
thar
swell
folks
johnnie
nodded
busily
at
work
making
a
more
elaborated
night
toilet
than
the
others
who
were
going
to
bed
all
about
them
paying
little
attention
to
their
conversation
miss
lyddy
she
ai
as
young
as
she
once
was
and
the
boys
has
quit
hangin
her
as
much
as
they
used
to
so
now
she
has
took
up
with
good
works
the
girl
on
the
bed
explained
with
a
directness
which
miss
sessions
would
not
perhaps
have
appreciated
her
and
some
other
of
the
nobby
folks
has
started
what
they
call
a
uplift
club
amongst
the
mill
girls
thar
a
big
room
whar
you
dance
if
you
can
and
whar
they
give
little
suppers
for
us
with
not
much
to
eat
and
thar
a
place
where
they
sorter
preach
to
ye
lecture
she
calls
it
i
do
know
miss
lyddy
hai
got
for
her
club
but
you
jist
go
and
listen
and
say
how
much
obliged
you
are
an
she
do
a
lot
for
you
besides
your
wages
to
get
you
out
of
the
mill
any
day
she
wants
you
for
the
upliftin
business
mandy
had
a
gasp
which
occurred
between
sentences
and
at
the
end
of
certain
words
with
grotesque
effect
johnnie
was
to
find
that
this
gasp
was
always
very
much
to
the
fore
when
mandy
was
being
uplifted
it
then
served
variously
as
the
gasp
of
humility
gratitude
admiration
the
gasp
of
chaste
emotion
the
gasp
of
reprobation
toward
others
who
did
not
come
forward
to
be
uplifted
did
you
say
there
was
books
at
that
club
inquired
johnnie
out
of
the
darkness
she
had
now
extinguished
the
light
can
a
body
learn
things
from
the
lectures
agreed
mandy
sleepily
but
you
do
have
to
read
the
books
they
lend
to
you
and
you
take
home
and
after
so
long
a
time
you
take
back
sayin
how
much
good
they
done
you
that
the
way
if
stoddard
he
ask
you
questions
about
but
miss
lyddy
wo
she
hates
to
find
out
that
any
of
her
plans
ai
workin
for
a
long
time
there
was
silence
mandy
was
just
dropping
off
into
her
first
heavy
sleep
when
a
whispering
voice
asked
is
stoddard
has
he
got
right
brown
eyes
and
right
brown
hair
and
does
he
ride
in
one
of
these
one
of
these
good
land
grumbled
the
addressed
i
thought
it
was
mornin
and
i
had
to
git
up
you
ort
to
been
asleep
long
ago
yes
stoddard
got
sorter
brown
eyes
and
hair
and
he
rides
in
a
how
did
you
know
but
mandy
was
too
tired
to
stay
awake
to
marvel
over
that
her
rhythmic
snores
soon
proved
that
she
slept
while
johnnie
lay
thinking
of
the
various
proffers
she
had
that
evening
received
of
a
lamp
to
her
feet
a
light
on
her
path
and
she
would
climb
yes
she
would
climb
not
by
the
road
pap
himes
pointed
out
not
by
the
devious
path
mandy
meacham
suggested
but
by
the
rugged
road
of
good
honest
toil
to
heights
where
was
the
power
and
the
glory
she
would
certainly
strive
she
conned
over
the
new
things
which
this
day
had
brought
again
she
saw
the
auto
swing
around
the
curve
and
halt
she
got
the
outline
of
the
man
bent
head
against
the
evening
sky
they
were
singing
again
over
at
the
mechanics
the
sound
came
across
to
her
window
the
vibrant
wires
the
chorus
of
deep
male
voices
even
the
words
she
knew
they
were
using
but
could
not
distinguish
linked
themselves
in
some
fashion
with
memory
of
a
man
eyes
his
smile
his
air
of
tender
deference
as
he
cherished
her
broken
flower
something
caught
in
her
throat
and
choked
her
mind
veered
to
the
figures
on
the
porch
of
that
palace
of
pleasure
the
girl
with
the
ball
tossing
it
to
the
young
fellow
below
on
the
lawn
in
memory
she
descended
the
hill
coming
down
into
the
shadows
with
each
step
looking
back
to
the
heights
and
the
light
well
she
had
said
that
if
one
had
feet
one
might
climb
and
the
old
man
had
tried
to
train
her
to
his
pace
for
attaining
heart
desire
in
the
midst
of
a
jumble
of
autos
and
shining
mill
windows
she
watched
the
room
grow
ghostly
with
the
light
of
a
moon
suddenly
afar
off
she
heard
the
honk
honk
honk
which
had
preceded
the
advent
of
the
car
on
the
ridge
road
getting
up
she
stole
to
the
one
window
which
the
long
room
afforded
it
gave
upon
the
main
street
of
the
village
honk
honk
honk
she
gazed
toward
the
steep
from
which
the
sounds
seemed
to
come
there
flashing
in
and
out
of
the
greenery
appeared
half
a
dozen
pairs
of
fiery
eyes
a
party
of
motorists
were
going
in
to
watauga
starting
from
the
country
club
on
the
ridge
crest
johnnie
watched
them
fascinated
as
the
foremost
car
swept
down
the
road
and
directly
beneath
her
window
its
driver
whom
she
recognized
with
a
little
shiver
by
the
characteristic
carriage
of
his
head
swerved
the
machine
out
and
stopped
it
at
the
curb
below
the
others
passed
calling
gay
inquiries
to
him
we
all
right
she
heard
a
voice
reply
you
go
ahead
we
be
there
before
you
the
slim
figure
in
the
seat
beside
him
laughed
softly
and
fluttered
a
white
handkerchief
as
the
last
car
went
on
now
exulted
the
voice
i
put
on
my
goggles
and
cap
and
we
show
them
what
running
is
they
take
the
high
road
and
we
take
the
low
and
we
be
in
watauga
them
even
as
he
spoke
he
adjusted
his
costume
and
johnnie
saw
the
car
shoot
forward
like
a
living
creature
eager
on
the
trail
she
sighed
as
she
looked
after
them
feet
of
what
use
were
feet
to
follow
such
a
flight
as
that
chapter
v
the
moccasin
flower
johnnie
was
used
to
hardship
and
early
rising
but
in
an
intermittent
fashion
for
the
passmores
and
consadines
were
a
haggard
lot
that
came
to
no
lure
but
their
own
pleasure
they
might
and
often
did
go
hungry
they
might
sometimes
in
order
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
have
to
labour
desperately
at
rude
tasks
unsuited
to
them
but
these
times
were
exceptions
and
between
such
seasons
down
to
the
least
of
the
tribe
they
had
always
followed
the
vision
pursuing
the
flying
skirts
of
whatever
ideal
was
in
their
shapely
heads
the
little
cabin
in
the
gash
of
the
hills
owned
for
domain
a
rocky
ravine
that
was
the
standing
jest
of
the
sure
hit
good
land
fine
land
the
mountaineers
would
comment
with
their
inveterate
dry
lazy
humour
nothing
on
earth
to
hender
a
man
from
raisin
a
crap
off
it
ef
he
could
once
git
the
leathers
on
a
good
stout
willin
o
hawks
or
buzzards
an
a
plough
hitched
to
and
johnnie
could
remember
the
other
children
teasing
her
and
saying
that
her
folks
had
to
load
a
gun
with
seed
corn
and
shoot
it
into
the
sky
to
reach
their
fields
yet
the
unmended
roof
covered
much
joy
and
good
feeling
they
were
light
feet
that
trod
the
unsecured
puncheons
the
passmores
were
tender
of
each
other
eccentricities
admiring
of
each
other
virtues
a
wolf
race
nourished
on
the
knees
of
purple
kings
how
should
they
ever
come
down
to
wearing
any
collar
to
slink
at
heel
and
retrieve
for
him
one
would
have
said
that
to
the
daughter
of
such
the
close
room
with
its
inhuman
clamour
its
fetid
air
its
long
hours
of
enforced
monotonous
mechanical
toil
would
be
prison
with
the
torture
added
but
johnnie
looked
forward
to
her
present
enterprise
as
a
soldier
going
into
a
new
country
to
conquer
it
she
was
buoyantly
certain
and
determinedly
delighted
with
everything
when
the
next
morning
after
her
arrival
mandy
meacham
shook
her
by
the
shoulder
and
bade
her
get
up
the
room
was
humming
with
the
roar
of
mill
whistles
and
the
gray
dawn
leaking
in
at
its
one
window
in
a
churlish
chary
fashion
reminded
her
that
they
were
under
the
shadow
of
a
mountain
instead
of
living
upon
its
top
i
do
see
what
in
the
world
could
made
me
sleep
so
johnnie
deprecated
as
she
made
haste
to
dress
herself
looks
like
i
never
had
nothing
to
do
yesterday
except
walking
down
i
been
on
foot
that
much
many
a
time
and
never
noticed
it
the
other
girls
in
the
room
poor
souls
were
all
cross
and
sleepy
nobody
had
time
to
converse
with
johnnie
as
they
went
down
the
stairs
another
contingent
began
to
straggle
up
having
eaten
a
hasty
meal
after
their
night
work
and
making
now
for
certain
of
the
beds
johnnie
ran
into
the
kitchen
to
help
bence
get
breakfast
on
the
table
for
pap
himes
was
bad
off
this
morning
with
a
misery
somewhere
and
his
daughter
was
sending
word
to
the
cotton
mill
to
put
a
substitute
on
her
looms
till
dinner
time
almost
as
much
to
her
own
surprise
as
to
that
of
everybody
else
mandy
meacham
proposed
to
stay
and
take
johnnie
in
to
register
for
a
job
when
the
others
were
all
seated
at
table
the
new
girl
from
the
mountains
took
her
cup
of
coffee
and
a
biscuit
and
dropped
upon
the
doorstep
to
eat
her
breakfast
the
back
yard
was
unenclosed
a
litter
of
tin
cans
and
ashes
running
with
its
desert
disorder
into
a
similar
one
on
either
side
but
there
were
no
houses
back
of
the
himes
place
the
ground
falling
away
sharply
to
the
rocky
creek
bed
across
the
ravine
half
a
dozen
strapping
young
fellows
were
lounging
waiting
for
breakfast
and
mechanics
these
whose
hours
were
more
favourable
than
those
of
the
women
and
children
workers
it
lots
prettier
out
here
than
it
is
in
the
house
she
returned
smilingly
when
mavity
bence
offered
to
get
her
a
chair
i
do
love
to
be
huh
grunted
mandy
with
her
mouth
full
of
biscuit
i
reckon
a
cotton
mill
jest
about
kill
you
what
makes
you
work
in
one
anyhow
i
would
if
i
could
help
it
johnnie
eyed
the
tall
girl
gravely
i
got
to
earn
some
money
she
said
at
length
ma
and
the
children
have
to
be
taken
care
of
i
know
of
any
better
way
than
the
mill
an
i
do
know
of
any
worse
retorted
mandy
sourly
as
they
went
out
together
johnnie
began
to
feel
timid
there
had
been
a
secret
hope
that
she
would
meet
shade
on
the
way
to
the
mill
or
that
bence
would
finally
get
through
in
time
to
accompany
her
she
was
suddenly
aware
that
there
was
not
a
soul
within
sound
of
her
voice
who
had
belonged
to
her
former
world
with
a
little
gasp
she
looked
about
her
as
they
entered
the
office
the
hardwick
mill
to
which
they
now
came
consisted
of
a
number
of
large
red
brick
buildings
joined
by
covered
abutting
on
one
of
those
sullen
pools
johnnie
had
noted
the
night
before
the
yard
enclosed
by
a
tight
board
fence
so
high
that
the
operatives
in
the
rooms
could
not
see
the
street
this
for
the
factory
portion
the
office
did
not
front
on
the
yard
but
opened
out
freely
on
to
the
street
through
a
little
grassy
square
of
its
own
with
paved
walks
and
flower
beds
as
with
all
the
mills
in
its
district
the
suggestion
was
dangerously
apt
of
a
penitentiary
with
its
high
wooden
barrier
around
all
the
building
the
only
free
approach
from
the
world
to
its
corridors
through
the
seemly
humanized
office
where
abided
the
heads
the
bosses
the
free
men
who
came
and
went
at
will
the
walls
were
already
beginning
to
wear
that
garment
of
green
which
the
american
ivy
flings
over
so
many
factory
buildings
as
the
two
girls
came
up
johnnie
looked
at
the
wide
clear
plate
windows
the
brass
railing
that
guarded
the
heavy
granite
approach
the
shining
name
hardwick
in
brazen
lettering
on
the
step
over
which
they
entered
inside
the
polished
oak
and
metal
of
office
fittings
carried
on
the
idea
of
splendour
if
not
of
luxury
back
of
the
crystal
windows
were
the
tempering
shades
all
was
spacious
ordered
with
quiet
dignity
and
there
was
no
sense
of
hurry
in
the
figures
of
men
that
sat
at
the
massive
desks
or
moved
about
the
softly
carpeted
floors
the
corridor
was
long
but
cleanly
swept
and
at
its
upper
portion
covered
with
a
material
unfamiliar
to
johnnie
but
which
she
recognized
as
suited
to
its
purpose
down
at
the
further
end
of
that
corridor
something
throbbed
and
moaned
and
roared
and
growled
the
factory
was
awake
there
and
working
the
contrast
struck
cold
to
the
girl
heart
here
yet
more
sharply
defined
was
the
same
difference
she
had
noted
between
the
palace
of
pleasure
on
the
heights
and
the
mills
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
would
the
people
think
she
was
good
enough
would
they
understand
how
hard
she
meant
to
try
for
a
minute
she
had
a
desperate
impulse
to
turn
and
run
then
she
heard
mandy
thin
flatted
tones
announcing
this
hyer
girl
wants
to
git
a
job
in
the
mill
miz
bence
she
come
down
this
morning
you
have
to
git
somebody
to
tend
her
looms
till
noon
pap
he
sick
and
she
has
obliged
to
wait
on
him
so
i
brung
the
new
gal
all
right
said
the
man
she
addressed
she
can
wait
there
you
go
on
to
your
looms
johnnie
sat
on
the
bench
against
the
wall
where
newcomers
applying
for
positions
were
placed
the
man
she
was
to
see
had
not
yet
come
to
his
desk
and
she
remained
unnoticed
and
apparently
forgotten
for
more
than
an
hour
the
offices
were
entered
from
the
other
side
yet
a
doorway
close
by
johnnie
commanded
a
view
of
a
room
and
desk
to
it
presently
came
one
who
seated
himself
and
began
opening
and
reading
letters
johnnie
caught
her
breath
and
leaned
a
little
forward
watching
him
her
heart
in
her
eyes
hands
locked
hard
together
in
her
lap
it
was
the
young
man
of
the
car
he
was
not
in
white
flannels
now
but
he
looked
almost
as
wonderful
to
the
girl
in
his
gray
business
suit
with
the
air
of
easy
command
and
the
quiet
only
latent
on
his
face
shade
buckheath
had
spoken
of
gray
stoddard
as
the
boss
of
the
bosses
down
at
cottonville
indeed
his
position
was
unique
inheritor
of
large
holdings
in
eastern
stock
he
had
returned
from
abroad
on
the
death
of
his
father
to
look
into
this
source
of
his
very
ample
income
the
mills
in
which
he
was
concerned
were
not
earning
as
they
should
so
he
was
told
and
there
was
discussion
as
to
whether
they
be
moved
south
or
a
southern
mill
be
established
which
might
be
considered
in
the
nature
of
a
branch
and
where
the
coarser
grades
of
sheeting
would
be
manufactured
as
well
as
all
the
spinning
done
but
stoddard
was
not
of
the
blood
that
takes
opinions
upon
his
mother
side
he
was
the
grandson
of
one
of
the
great
agitators
the
sister
of
this
man
gray
had
stood
beside
him
on
the
platform
when
there
was
danger
in
it
and
after
the
negro
was
freed
and
enfranchised
she
had
devoted
a
long
life
to
the
cause
of
woman
suffrage
the
mother
who
bore
him
died
young
she
left
him
to
the
care
of
a
conservative
father
but
the
blood
that
came
through
her
did
not
make
for
conservatism
perhaps
it
was
some
admixture
of
his
father
traits
which
set
the
young
man
to
investigating
the
situation
in
his
own
fashion
to
do
this
as
he
conceived
it
should
be
done
he
had
hired
himself
to
the
hardwick
spinning
company
in
an
office
position
which
gave
him
a
fair
outlook
on
the
business
and
put
him
in
complete
touch
with
the
practical
side
of
it
yet
the
facts
of
the
case
made
the
situation
evident
to
those
under
him
as
well
as
his
peers
whatever
convictions
and
opinions
he
was
maturing
in
this
year
with
the
hardwicks
he
kept
to
himself
but
he
was
supposed
to
hold
some
socialistic
ideas
and
lydia
sessions
james
hardwick
made
her
devoir
to
these
by
engaging
zealously
in
enterprises
among
the
he
was
a
passionate
individualist
the
word
seems
unduly
fiery
when
one
remembers
the
smiling
insouciant
manner
of
his
divergences
from
the
conventional
type
yet
he
was
inveterately
himself
and
not
some
schoolmaster
or
tailor
or
barber
version
of
gray
stoddard
and
in
this
though
johnnie
did
not
know
it
lay
the
strength
of
his
charm
for
her
the
moments
passed
unheeded
after
he
came
into
her
field
of
vision
and
she
watched
him
for
some
time
busy
at
his
morning
work
it
took
her
breath
when
he
raised
his
eyes
suddenly
and
their
glances
encountered
he
plainly
recognized
her
at
once
and
nodded
a
cheerful
greeting
after
a
while
he
got
up
and
came
out
into
the
hall
his
hands
full
of
papers
evidently
on
his
way
to
one
of
the
other
offices
he
paused
beside
the
bench
and
spoke
to
her
waiting
for
the
room
boss
are
they
going
to
put
you
on
this
morning
he
asked
pleasantly
yes
i
to
get
a
chance
to
work
right
away
she
smiled
up
at
him
ai
it
fine
the
smile
that
answered
hers
held
something
pitying
yet
it
was
a
pity
that
did
not
hurt
or
offend
yes
i
sure
it
fine
if
you
think
so
said
stoddard
half
reluctantly
then
his
eye
caught
the
broken
pink
blossom
which
johnnie
had
pinned
to
the
front
of
her
bodice
what
that
he
asked
it
looks
like
an
orchid
he
was
instantly
apologetic
for
the
word
but
johnnie
detached
the
flower
from
her
dress
and
held
it
toward
him
it
is
she
assented
it
an
orchid
and
the
little
yellow
flower
that
call
the
whippoorwill
shoe
is
an
orchid
too
stoddard
thrust
his
papers
into
his
coat
pocket
and
took
the
blossom
in
his
hand
that
the
pink
moccasin
flower
johnnie
told
him
they
do
bloom
in
the
valley
at
all
and
they
not
very
plenty
in
the
mountains
i
picked
this
one
six
miles
up
on
white
oak
ridge
yesterday
i
reckon
i
have
seen
more
than
a
dozen
of
these
in
my
life
and
i
hunted
flowers
all
over
unaka
i
never
had
the
chance
to
analyze
one
observed
stoddard
i
like
to
get
hold
of
a
good
specimen
i
sorry
this
one
broken
johnnie
deprecated
then
her
clouded
face
cleared
suddenly
with
its
luminous
smile
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
reckon
it
would
have
been
knocked
over
the
edge
of
the
road
she
added
that
the
flower
i
had
in
my
handkerchief
yesterday
evening
stoddard
continued
to
examine
the
pink
blossom
with
interest
you
said
it
grew
up
in
the
mountains
and
did
grow
in
the
valley
he
reminded
her
she
nodded
of
course
i
not
certain
about
that
and
while
she
spoke
he
transferred
his
attention
from
the
flower
to
the
girl
i
really
know
mighty
little
about
such
things
and
i
not
been
in
the
valley
to
exceed
ten
times
in
my
life
miss
baird
that
taught
the
school
i
went
to
over
at
rainy
gap
had
a
herbarium
and
put
all
kinds
of
pressed
flowers
in
it
i
gathered
a
great
many
for
her
and
she
taught
me
to
analyze
them
like
you
were
speaking
of
but
i
never
did
love
to
do
that
it
seemed
like
naming
over
and
calling
out
the
ways
of
your
friends
to
pull
the
flower
all
to
pieces
and
press
it
and
paste
it
in
a
book
and
write
down
all
its
its
ways
and
faults
again
she
smiled
up
at
him
radiantly
and
the
young
man
astonished
glance
went
from
her
dusty
cowhide
shoes
to
the
thick
roll
of
fair
hair
on
her
graceful
head
what
manner
of
did
the
mountains
send
down
to
the
valley
but
i
began
stoddard
deprecatingly
when
johnnie
reddened
and
broke
in
hastily
oh
i
do
mean
that
for
you
miss
baird
taught
me
for
three
years
and
i
loved
her
as
dearly
as
i
ever
could
any
one
you
may
keep
this
flower
if
you
want
to
and
come
sunday
i
get
you
another
one
that
wo
be
broken
why
sunday
asked
stoddard
well
i
would
have
time
to
go
after
them
till
then
and
the
ones
i
know
of
would
be
open
before
sunday
i
saw
just
three
there
by
the
spring
that
the
way
they
grow
you
know
two
or
three
in
a
place
and
not
another
for
miles
you
saw
them
growing
repeated
stoddard
i
should
like
to
see
one
on
its
roots
and
maybe
make
a
little
sketch
of
it
could
you
just
as
well
show
me
the
place
sunday
for
no
reason
that
she
could
assign
and
very
much
against
her
will
johnnie
face
flushed
deeply
i
reckon
i
could
she
answered
evasively
hit
a
long
ways
up
and
hit
a
long
ways
up
and
yet
you
going
to
walk
it
after
a
week
work
here
in
the
mill
persisted
stoddard
you
better
tell
me
where
they
grow
and
let
me
go
up
in
my
car
i
i
could
said
johnnie
embarrassed
but
you
never
find
it
in
the
world
they
is
one
thing
that
i
could
tell
you
to
know
the
place
by
and
you
have
to
leave
the
road
and
walk
a
little
piece
oh
it
no
use
and
i
do
mind
i
just
love
to
go
up
there
and
get
the
flowers
for
you
are
you
the
new
girl
inquired
a
voice
at
johnnie
shoulder
they
turned
to
find
a
squat
man
regarding
them
dubiously
yes
answered
johnnie
rising
i
been
waiting
quite
a
while
well
come
this
way
directed
the
man
and
turning
led
her
away
down
the
hall
they
went
then
up
a
flight
of
wooden
stairs
which
carried
them
to
a
covered
bridge
and
so
to
the
upper
story
of
the
factory
that
an
girl
old
andrew
macpherson
made
the
comment
as
he
received
the
papers
from
stoddard
hands
the
one
i
was
speaking
to
in
the
hall
inquired
stoddard
rather
unnecessarily
yes
she
seems
to
have
an
unusual
mind
as
well
these
mountain
people
are
peculiar
they
appear
to
have
no
idea
of
class
and
therefore
are
in
a
measure
all
aristocrats
well
that
ought
to
square
with
your
socialistic
notions
chaffed
macpherson
sorting
the
work
on
his
desk
and
pushing
a
certain
portion
of
it
toward
stoddard
sit
down
here
if
you
please
and
we
go
over
these
now
the
girl
looked
a
good
deal
like
a
fairy
princess
i
think
she
a
safe
topic
for
susceptible
young
chaps
like
you
and
me
the
grizzled
old
scotchman
concluded
with
a
chuckle
your
socialistic
hullabaloo
makes
you
liable
to
foregather
with
all
sorts
of
impossible
people
gray
shook
his
head
laughing
as
he
seated
himself
at
the
desk
beside
the
other
oh
i
only
a
theoretical
socialist
he
deprecated
hum
grunted
the
older
man
a
theoretical
socialist
always
seemed
to
me
about
like
a
theoretical
pickpocket
neither
of
them
stands
to
do
much
harm
for
example
here
you
are
one
of
the
richest
young
fellows
of
my
acquaintance
living
along
very
contentedly
where
every
tenet
you
profess
to
hold
is
daily
outraged
you
not
giving
away
your
money
you
take
a
healthy
interest
in
a
good
car
a
good
dinner
the
gals
even
told
you
have
a
fad
for
old
porcelains
and
yet
you
call
yourself
a
socialist
these
economic
conditions
are
not
a
pin
answered
gray
smiling
i
do
have
to
jump
and
say
the
minute
i
find
they
prick
me
worse
conditions
have
always
been
and
no
doubt
bad
ones
will
survive
for
a
time
and
pass
away
as
mankind
outgrows
them
i
have
the
colossal
conceit
to
suppose
that
i
can
reform
the
world
not
even
push
it
much
faster
toward
the
destination
of
good
to
which
it
is
rolling
but
i
want
to
know
i
want
to
understand
myself
then
if
there
is
anything
for
me
to
do
i
shall
do
it
it
may
be
that
the
present
conditions
are
the
best
possible
for
the
present
moment
it
may
be
that
if
a
lot
of
us
got
together
and
agreed
we
could
better
them
exceedingly
it
is
not
certain
in
my
mind
yet
that
any
growth
is
of
value
to
humanity
which
does
not
proceed
from
within
this
is
true
of
the
individual
must
it
not
be
true
of
the
class
no
doubt
no
doubt
agreed
macpherson
indifferently
most
of
the
men
who
are
loud
in
the
leadership
of
socialism
have
made
a
failure
of
their
own
lives
we
see
what
happens
when
a
man
who
is
a
personal
and
economic
success
sets
up
to
teach
if
you
mean
that
very
complimentary
description
for
me
said
gray
with
sudden
seriousness
i
will
say
to
you
here
and
now
that
there
is
no
preacher
in
me
but
when
i
am
a
little
clearer
in
my
own
mind
as
to
what
i
believe
i
shall
practise
the
only
real
creed
is
a
manner
of
life
if
you
do
live
it
you
do
really
believe
it
chapter
vi
weavers
and
weft
the
hardwick
mill
was
a
large
one
to
the
girl
it
seemed
endless
while
its
clamour
and
roar
was
a
thing
to
daunt
they
passed
through
the
spinning
department
in
which
the
long
lines
of
frames
were
tended
by
children
and
reached
the
whose
looms
required
the
attention
of
women
with
here
and
there
a
man
who
had
failed
to
make
a
success
of
male
occupations
and
sunk
to
the
feminine
activities
in
a
corner
of
one
of
these
johnnie
guide
stopped
before
two
silent
motionless
looms
and
threw
on
the
power
he
began
to
instruct
her
in
their
operation
all
communication
being
in
dumb
show
for
the
clapping
thunder
of
the
instantly
snatches
the
sound
from
one
lips
and
batters
it
into
shapelessness
johnnie
had
been
an
expert
weaver
on
the
ancient
looms
of
the
mountains
but
the
strangeness
of
the
new
machine
the
noise
and
her
surroundings
bewildered
her
when
the
man
saw
that
she
was
not
likely
to
injure
herself
or
the
looms
he
turned
away
with
a
careless
nod
and
left
her
to
her
fate
it
was
a
blowy
april
day
outside
with
a
gay
blue
sky
in
which
the
white
clouds
raced
drawing
barges
of
shadow
over
the
earth
below
but
the
necessity
of
keeping
dust
out
of
the
machinery
the
inconvenience
of
having
flying
ends
carried
toward
it
closed
every
window
in
the
big
factory
and
the
operatives
gasped
in
the
early
heat
the
odour
of
oil
the
exhausted
air
there
was
a
ventilating
system
in
the
hardwick
mill
and
it
was
supposed
to
be
exceptionally
free
from
lint
but
the
fagged
children
crowded
to
the
casements
with
instinctive
longing
for
the
outdoor
air
which
could
not
of
course
enter
through
the
glass
or
plodded
their
monotonous
rounds
to
tend
the
frames
and
see
that
the
thread
was
running
properly
to
each
spool
and
that
the
spools
were
removed
when
filled
by
noon
every
nerve
in
johnnie
body
quivered
with
excitement
and
overstrain
yet
when
mandy
came
for
her
at
the
dinner
hour
she
showed
her
a
face
still
resolute
and
asked
that
a
snack
be
brought
her
to
the
mill
i
do
see
why
you
wo
come
along
home
and
eat
your
dinner
the
meacham
woman
commented
the
lord
knows
you
get
time
enough
to
stay
in
the
mill
working
over
them
old
looms
say
i
seen
you
in
the
hall
did
you
know
who
you
was
talking
to
the
red
flooded
johnnie
face
as
she
knelt
before
her
loom
interrogating
its
workings
with
a
dexterous
hand
even
the
white
nape
of
her
neck
showed
pink
to
mandy
examining
eye
but
she
managed
to
reply
in
a
fairly
even
tone
yes
that
was
stoddard
i
saw
him
yesterday
evening
when
i
was
coming
down
the
ridge
with
shade
but

johnnie
sat
up
on
her
heels
and
turned
a
laughing
face
across
her
shoulder
i

any
reason
to
want

biscuit
and
a
piece
of
meat
good
land
johnnie
consadine
but
you
quare
exclaimed
mandy
staring
with
bulging
light
eyes
if
it
was
me
i
be
all
in
a
tremble
yet
and
there
you
sit
and
talk
about
meat
and
bread
johnnie
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
explain
that
the
tremor
of
that
conversation
with
stoddard
had
indeed
lasted
through
her
entire
morning
there
was
nothing
to
tremble
about
she
remarked
with
surface
calm
he
never
seen
a
pink
moccasin
flower
and
i
gave
him
the
one
i
had
and
told
him
where
it
grew
well
he
was
looking
at
no
moccasin
flower
when
i
seed
him
mandy
persisted
he
was
lookin
at
you
he
jest
eyed
you
as
if
you
was
miss
lydia
sessions
herself
more
so
if
anything
johnnie
inwardly
rebuked
the
throb
of
joy
which
greeted
this
statement
i
reckon
his
looks
are
his
own
mandy
she
said
soberly
you
and
me
have
no
call
to
notice
them
ai
got
no
call
to
notice
well
i
jest
i
could
get
you
and
him
up
in
front
of
miss
sessions
and
have
her
see
them
looks
of
grumbled
mandy
as
she
turned
away
i
bet
you
there
be
some
noticin
done
then
when
in
the
evening
mandy
came
for
johnnie
she
found
the
new
mill
hand
white
about
the
mouth
with
exhaustion
choking
and
ready
to
weep
said
the
meacham
woman
i
know
just
how
you
feel
they
all
look
the
first
day
or
two
then
after
that
they
look
worse
nervelessly
johnnie
found
her
way
downstairs
in
the
stream
of
tired
girls
and
women
there
was
more
than
one
kindly
greeting
for
the
new
hand
and
occasionally
somebody
clapped
her
on
the
shoulder
and
assured
her
that
a
few
days
more
would
get
her
used
to
the
work
the
mill
yard
was
large
filled
with
and
gravel
walks
but
it
was
shut
in
by
a
boarding
so
tall
that
the
street
could
not
be
seen
from
the
windows
of
the
lower
floor
to
johnnie
weary
to
the
point
where
aching
muscles
and
blood
charged
with
uneliminated
waste
spelled
pessimism
that
high
board
fence
seemed
to
make
of
the
pretty
place
a
prison
yard
a
man
was
propping
open
the
big
wooden
gates
and
through
them
she
saw
the
street
the
sidewalk
and
a
carriage
drawn
up
at
the
curb
in
this
vehicle
sat
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
hat
in
hand
talked
to
her
from
the
sidewalk
come
on
hissed
mandy
seizing
her
companion
arm
and
dragging
her
forward
thar
miss
lydia
sessions
right
now
and
that
stoddard
to
her
i
go
straight
up
and
give
you
a
knockdown
i
want
to
anyway
she
the
one
that
runs
the
uplift
club
if
she
takes
a
shine
to
you
it
be
money
in
your
pocket
she
turned
over
her
shoulder
to
glance
at
johnnie
who
was
pulling
vigorously
back
there
was
no
hint
of
tiredness
or
depression
in
the
girl
face
now
her
deep
eyes
glowed
red
was
again
in
the
fresh
lips
that
parted
over
the
white
teeth
in
an
adorable
tremulous
smile
mandy
stared
hurry
up
he
be
gittin
away
she
admonished
oh
no
objected
the
new
girl
wait
till
some
other
time
i
i
want
to
but
her
remonstrance
came
too
late
mandy
had
yanked
her
forward
and
was
performing
the
introduction
she
so
euphoniously
described
gray
stoddard
turned
and
bowed
to
both
girls
he
carried
the
broken
orchid
in
his
hand
and
apparently
had
been
speaking
of
it
to
miss
sessions
mandy
eyed
him
narrowly
to
see
if
any
of
the
looks
she
had
apprehended
as
offensive
to
miss
sessions
went
in
johnnie
direction
and
she
was
not
disappointed
stoddard
gaze
lingered
long
on
the
radiant
countenance
of
the
girl
from
unaka
not
so
the
young
women
looked
after
a
few
months
of
factory
life
he
was
getting
to
know
well
the
odd
the
cotton
mill
puts
on
country
cheeks
the
curious
dulled
yet
resentful
expression
of
the
eyes
begotten
by
continuous
repetition
of
excessive
hours
of
trivial
monotonous
toil
would
this
girl
come
at
last
to
that
favour
he
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
strength
of
protest
in
his
own
heart
then
macpherson
coming
down
the
office
steps
called
to
him
and
with
courteous
adieux
the
two
men
departed
in
company
johnnie
was
a
bit
grieved
to
find
that
the
removal
from
miss
sessions
of
the
shrouding
misty
veil
revealed
a
countenance
somewhat
angular
in
outline
with
cheekbones
a
trifle
hard
and
high
and
a
lack
of
colour
she
fancied
too
that
miss
sessions
was
slightly
annoyed
about
something
she
wondered
if
it
was
because
they
had
interrupted
her
conversation
with
stoddard
and
driven
him
away
yet
while
she
so
questioned
she
was
taking
in
with
swift
appreciation
the
trim
set
of
the
driving
coat
miss
lydia
wore
the
appropriate
texture
of
the
heavy
gloves
on
the
small
hands
that
held
the
lines
and
a
certain
indefinable
air
of
elegance
hard
to
put
into
words
but
which
all
women
recognize
ai
she
swell
inquired
mandy
as
they
passed
on
she
after
stoddard
now
it
used
to
be
the
preacher
that
had
the
big
church
in
watauga
but
he
moved
away
i
wish
i
had
her
clothes
yes
returned
johnnie
absently
she
had
already
forgotten
her
impression
of
miss
sessions
displeasure
gone
was
the
leaden
weariness
of
her
day
toil
something
intimate
and
kind
in
the
glance
stoddard
had
given
her
remained
warm
at
her
heart
and
set
that
heart
singing
meantime
stoddard
and
macpherson
were
walking
up
the
ridge
toward
the
country
club
together
intending
to
spend
the
night
on
the
highlands
the
scotchman
returned
once
more
to
the
subject
he
had
broached
that
morning
this
is
a
great
country
he
opened
obliquely
a
very
great
country
but
you
americans
will
have
to
learn
that
generations
of
blood
and
breeding
are
not
to
be
skipped
with
impunity
see
the
sons
and
daughters
of
your
rich
men
if
the
hope
of
the
land
lay
in
them
it
would
be
a
bad
outlook
indeed
is
that
peculiar
to
america
asked
stoddard
mildly
they
were
coming
under
the
trees
now
he
took
off
his
hat
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
to
enjoy
the
coolness
my
impression
was
that
the
youthful
aristocracy
of
every
country
often
made
of
itself
a
spectacle
unseemly
the
scotchman
laughed
then
he
looked
sidewise
at
his
companion
not
denying
he
pursued
again
with
that
odd
trick
of
entering
his
argument
from
the
side
that
a
young
chap
like
yourself
has
my
good
word
a
man
with
money
who
will
go
to
work
to
find
out
how
that
money
was
made
and
to
live
as
his
father
did
carries
an
old
head
on
young
shoulders
i
put
aside
your
socialistic
vapourings
of
course
every
fellow
to
his
fad
i
see
in
you
the
makings
of
a
canny
business
man
it
was
stoddard
turn
to
laugh
and
he
did
so
unrestrainedly
throwing
back
his
head
and
uttering
his
mirth
so
boyishly
that
the
other
smiled
in
sympathy
you
talk
about
what
in
the
blood
gray
said
finally
and
then
you
make
light
of
my
socialistic
vapourings
as
you
call
them
my
clan
and
it
is
from
the
spindle
side
that
a
man
gets
his
traits
are
all
as
far
back
as
i
know
anything
about
them
they
fought
with
cromwell
some
of
them
they
came
over
and
robbed
the
indians
in
true
sanctimonious
fashion
and
persecuted
the
quakers
and
down
the
line
a
bit
i
get
some
quaker
blood
that
stood
for
its
beliefs
in
the
stocks
and
sacrificed
its
ears
for
what
it
thought
right
i
afraid
the
socialistic
vapourings
are
the
true
expression
of
the
animal
macpherson
grunted
incredulously
i
give
you
ten
years
to
be
done
with
it
he
said
it
is
a
disease
of
youth
but
do
let
it
mark
your
affairs
it
is
all
right
to
foregather
with
these
workingmen
and
find
out
about
their
and
that
sort
of
thing
such
knowledge
will
be
useful
to
you
in
your
business
but
when
it
comes
to
women
macpherson
paused
and
shook
his
gray
head
to
young
pretty
women
a
man
must
stick
to
his
own
class
you
mean
the
girl
in
the
corridor
said
stoddard
with
that
directness
which
his
friends
were
apt
to
find
disconcerting
i
have
classified
her
yet
she
rather
an
extraordinary
specimen
well
she
not
in
your
class
and
best
leave
her
alone
returned
macpherson
doggedly
it
would
matter
if
the
young
thing
were
not
so
beautiful
and
with
such
a
winning
look
in
her
eyes
this
america
beats
me
that
poor
lass
would
make
a
model
princess
according
to
common
ideals
of
royalty
and
here
you
find
her
coming
out
of
some
hut
in
the
mountains
and
going
to
work
in
a
factory
miss
lydia
sessions
is
a
young
woman
now
she
been
all
over
europe
and
profited
by
her
advantages
of
travel
i
call
her
an
exceedingly
person
she
is
agreed
stoddard
without
enthusiasm
and
i
sure
you
must
admire
her
altruistic
ideas
they
just
fall
in
with
yours
i
suppose
now
stoddard
shook
his
head
not
at
all
he
said
briefly
if
you
were
enough
interested
in
socialism
to
know
what
we
folks
are
driving
at
i
could
explain
to
you
why
we
object
to
charitable
enterprises
but
it
not
worth
while
indeed
it
is
not
assented
macpherson
hastily
though
no
doubt
we
might
have
a
fine
argument
over
it
some
evening
when
we
have
nothing
better
to
talk
about
i
thought
you
and
miss
sessions
were
fixing
up
a
match
of
it
and
it
struck
me
as
a
very
good
thing
too
the
holdings
of
both
of
you
are
in
property
i
judge
that
always
makes
for
harmony
and
stability
in
a
matrimonial
alliance
stoddard
smiled
he
was
aware
that
miss
lydia
holdings
consisted
of
a
complaisant
in
whose
house
she
was
welcome
till
she
could
marry
but
he
said
nothing
on
this
head
macpherson
he
began
very
seriously
i
wonder
a
little
at
you
i
know
you
people
regard
these
things
differently
but
could
you
look
at
hardwick
children
and
seriously
recommend
sister
as
a
wife
for
a
friend
old
macpherson
stopped
in
the
way
thrust
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
and
stared
at
the
younger
man
well
he
ejaculated
at
last
that
a
great
speech
for
a
young
fellow
your
foresight
is
worthy
of
a
scotchman
gray
stoddard
smiled
i
am
not
a
person
he
observed
nobody
but
you
ever
accused
me
of
such
a
thing
marriage
concerns
the
race
and
a
man
whole
future
if
the
children
of
the
marriage
are
likely
to
be
unsatisfactory
the
marriage
will
certainly
be
so
we
moderns
bedeck
and
bedrape
us
in
all
sorts
of
meretricious
togas
till
a
pair
of
fine
eyes
and
a
dashing
manner
pass
for
beauty
but
when
life
tries
the
metal
when
nature
applies
her
inevitable
test
the
degenerate
or
neurotic
type
goes
to
the
wall
again
macpherson
grunted
no
doubt
you
sound
enough
but
it
is
rather
uncanny
to
hear
a
young
fellow
talk
like
his
grandfather
the
scotchman
said
finally
are
there
many
of
your
sort
in
this
astonishing
land
a
good
many
stoddard
told
him
the
modern
young
man
of
education
and
wealth
is
doing
one
of
two
things
burning
up
his
money
and
going
to
the
dogs
as
fast
as
he
can
or
putting
in
a
power
of
thinking
and
trying
while
he
saves
his
own
soul
to
do
his
part
in
the
regeneration
of
the
world
yes
well
it
a
big
job
it
been
on
hand
a
long
time
the
young
men
of
america
have
their
work
cut
out
for
them
said
macpherson
drily
no
doubt
returned
stoddard
with
undisturbed
cheerfulness
but
when
every
man
saves
his
own
soul
the
salvation
of
the
world
will
come
to
pass
chapter
vii
above
the
valley
all
week
in
johnnie
the
white
flame
of
purpose
burned
out
every
consciousness
of
weariness
of
bodily
or
mental
distaste
the
preposterously
long
hours
the
rooms
the
savage
monotony
of
her
toil
none
of
these
reached
the
girl
through
the
glow
of
hope
and
ambition
physically
the
finger
of
the
factory
was
already
laid
upon
her
vigorous
young
frame
but
when
sunday
morning
came
though
there
was
no
bellowing
whistle
to
break
in
on
her
slumbers
she
waked
early
and
while
nerve
and
muscle
begged
achingly
for
more
sleep
she
rose
with
a
sense
of
exhilaration
which
nothing
could
dampen
she
had
seen
a
small
mountain
church
over
the
ridge
by
the
spring
where
her
moccasin
flowers
grew
and
if
there
were
preaching
in
it
the
boys
and
girls
scouring
the
surrounding
woods
during
the
intermissions
would
surely
find
and
carry
away
the
orchids
there
was
no
safety
but
to
take
the
road
early
the
room
was
dark
mandy
slept
noisily
beside
her
all
the
beds
were
full
because
the
workers
were
in
she
meant
to
be
very
careful
to
waken
nobody
poor
souls
they
needed
this
one
day
of
rest
when
they
could
all
lie
late
searching
for
something
she
cautiously
struck
a
match
and
in
the
flaring
up
of
its
small
flame
got
a
glimpse
of
mandy
face
pallid
unbeautiful
against
the
tumbled
pillow
a
great
rush
of
pity
filled
her
eyes
with
tears
but
then
she
was
in
a
mood
to
compassionate
any
creature
who
had
not
the
prospect
of
a
walk
to
get
a
flower
for
gray
stoddard
it
was
in
that
black
hour
before
dawn
that
johnnie
let
herself
out
the
front
door
finding
the
direction
by
instinct
rather
than
any
assistance
from
sight
since
fences
trees
houses
were
but
vague
blots
of
deeper
shadow
in
the
black
she
was
well
on
her
way
before
a
light
here
and
there
in
a
cabin
window
showed
that
sunday
morning
as
it
was
the
earliest
risers
were
beginning
to
stir
her
face
was
set
to
the
east
and
after
a
time
a
pallid
line
showed
itself
above
the
great
bulk
of
mountains
which
in
this
quarter
backed
up
the
ramparts
of
the
circling
ridges
about
watauga
the
furthest
line
was
big
unaka
but
this
passionate
lover
of
her
native
highlands
gave
it
neither
thought
nor
glance
as
she
tramped
steadily
with
lifted
face
following
unconsciously
the
beckoning
finger
of
fate
it
was
a
spring
morning
and
with
the
air
so
full
of
moisture
that
it
gathered
and
pattered
from
the
scant
leafage
she
was
two
miles
up
swinging
along
at
that
steady
pace
her
youth
had
given
her
when
the
sky
began
to
flush
faintly
and
the
first
hint
of
dawn
rested
on
her
upraised
countenance
mists
swept
down
upon
her
from
the
heights
and
she
walked
through
them
unnoting
the
pale
light
from
the
eastern
sky
shone
on
an
aspect
introverted
rapt
away
from
knowledge
of
its
surroundings
she
was
going
to
get
something
for
him
she
had
promised
him
the
flowers
and
he
would
be
pleased
with
them
he
would
smile
when
he
thanked
her
for
them
and
look
at
her
as
he
had
when
she
gave
him
the
broken
blossom
a
look
like
that
was
to
the
girl
in
her
present
mood
as
the
sword
touch
on
the
shoulder
of
the
lad
who
is
being
knighted
by
his
king
it
made
her
want
to
rise
up
and
be
all
that
such
a
man
could
ever
demand
of
her
twelve
miles
of
walking
after
a
week
toil
in
the
mill
was
a
very
small
offering
to
put
before
so
worshipful
a
divinity
she
sought
vaguely
to
conjecture
just
what
his
words
would
be
when
next
they
spoke
together
her
lips
formed
themselves
into
tender
reminiscent
as
she
went
over
the
few
and
brief
moments
of
her
three
interviews
with
stoddard
johnnie
was
not
inexperienced
in
matters
of
the
heart
mating
time
comes
early
in
the
mountains
had
her
dreams
been
of
shade
buckheath
or
any
of
the
boys
of
her
own
kind
and
class
she
would
have
been
instantly
full
of
but
gray
stoddard
appeared
to
her
a
creature
so
apart
from
her
sphere
that
this
overwhelming
attraction
he
held
for
her
seemed
no
more
than
the
admiration
she
might
have
given
to
miss
lydia
sessions
and
so
the
dream
lay
undisturbed
under
her
eyelashes
and
she
breasted
the
slope
of
the
big
mountain
with
a
buoyant
step
oblivious
of
fatigue
she
reached
the
little
wayside
spring
before
even
the
mountain
folk
were
abroad
found
three
pink
blossoms
in
full
perfection
plucked
them
and
wrapped
them
carefully
in
damp
cloths
disposed
in
a
little
hickory
basket
that
uncle
pros
had
made
for
her
years
ago
it
was
a
tiny
thing
designed
to
hold
a
child
or
a
young
sewing
but
shaped
and
fashioned
after
the
manner
of
mountain
baskets
and
woven
of
stout
white
hickory
withes
shaved
down
to
daintier
size
and
pliancy
by
the
old
man
life
was
very
sweet
to
johnnie
consadine
as
she
straightened
up
basket
in
hand
and
turned
toward
the
home
journey
it
was
nearly
nine
when
she
reached
the
gap
above
cottonville
she
was
singing
a
little
softly
to
herself
as
she
footed
it
down
the
road
and
wishing
that
she
might
see
gray
face
when
he
got
her
flowers
she
planned
to
put
them
in
a
glass
on
his
desk
monday
morning
and
of
course
she
would
be
at
her
loom
long
before
he
should
reach
the
office
she
was
glad
they
were
such
fine
specimens
all
perfect
lovingly
she
pulled
aside
the
wet
cloth
and
looked
in
at
them
she
began
to
meet
people
on
the
road
and
the
cabins
she
passed
were
open
and
thronged
with
morning
life
the
next
turn
in
the
road
would
bring
her
to
the
spring
where
she
had
rested
that
evening
just
a
week
ago
and
where
shade
had
met
her
suddenly
she
caught
the
sheen
of
something
down
the
road
between
the
scant
greenery
it
was
a
carriage
or
an
automobile
now
it
was
more
likely
to
be
the
former
than
the
latter
also
there
were
a
cars
in
cottonville
yet
from
the
first
she
knew
and
was
prepared
for
it
when
the
shining
vehicle
came
nearer
and
showed
her
gray
stoddard
driving
it
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
stoddard
brought
the
machine
to
a
halt
beside
her
she
came
mutely
forward
a
hesitating
hand
at
her
basket
covering
her
eyes
raised
to
his
with
the
deathless
instinct
for
greeting
she
was
first
to
speak
howdy
she
breathed
softly
i
i
was
looking
for
i
got
you
she
fell
silent
again
still
regarding
him
and
fumbling
blindly
at
the
cover
of
the
basket
well
are
you
lost
inquired
stoddard
with
a
rather
futile
assumption
of
surprise
he
was
strangely
moved
by
the
direct
gaze
of
those
clear
gray
eyes
under
the
white
brow
and
the
ruffled
coronet
of
bright
hair
no
returned
johnnie
gently
literally
you
know
i
said
i
come
up
here
and
get
those
moccasin
flowers
for
you
this
morning
this
is
my
road
home
anyhow
i
not
as
near
lost
on
it
as
i
am
at
a
loom
down
in
the
factory
stoddard
continued
to
stare
at
the
hand
she
had
laid
on
the
car
it
be
an
awfully
long
walk
for
you
he
said
at
last
choosing
his
words
with
some
difficulty
wo
you
get
in
and
let
me
take
you
up
to
the
spring
johnnie
laughed
softly
exultantly
oh
i
picked
your
flowers
before
day
broke
i
bet
there
have
been
a
dozen
boys
over
from
to
drink
out
of
that
spring
before
this
time
you
would
have
had
any
blooms
if
i
had
got
up
early
again
she
laughed
and
uncovering
the
orchids
held
them
up
to
him
these
are
beauties
he
exclaimed
with
due
enthusiasm
yet
with
a
certain
uneasy
preoccupation
in
his
manner
were
you
up
before
day
did
you
tell
me
to
get
these
that
seems
too
bad
you
needed
your
sleep
johnnie
flushed
and
smiled
i
love
to
do
it
she
said
simply
it
was
mighty
sweet
out
on
the
road
this
morning
and
you
do
know
how
pretty
the
blooms
did
look
standing
there
waiting
for
me
i
hated
to
pick
them
stoddard
troubled
eyes
raised
themselves
to
her
face
here
was
a
royal
nature
that
would
always
be
in
the
attitude
of
the
giver
he
wanted
to
offer
her
something
and
as
the
nearest
thing
in
reach
sprang
down
from
the
automobile
and
laying
a
hand
on
her
arm
said
almost
brusquely
get
in
come
let
me
help
you
i
want
to
go
up
and
see
the
spring
where
these
grow
i
get
you
back
to
cottonville
in
time
for
church
if
that
what
you
debating
about
both
of
them
knew
that
johnnie
reluctance
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
of
stoddard
himself
was
well
aware
that
a
factory
girl
could
not
with
propriety
accept
a
seat
in
his
car
yet
when
once
they
were
settled
side
by
side
and
the
car
resumed
that
swift
tireless
climb
which
is
the
wonder
and
delight
of
the
mechanical
vehicle
it
was
characteristic
that
both
put
aside
definitely
and
completely
all
hesitations
and
doubts
the
girl
was
freely
innocently
exultantly
blissful
stoddard
noticed
her
intent
examination
of
the
machine
and
began
explaining
its
workings
to
her
was
that
what
you
were
doing
she
asked
alluding
to
some
small
item
of
the
operating
when
you
stopped
by
the
side
of
the
road
sunday
night
when
miss
lydia
was
with
you
he
looked
his
astonishment
you
were
right
under
my
window
when
you
stopped
johnnie
explained
to
him
i
watched
when
you
started
away
i
was
sure
you
would
beat
we
did
stoddard
assured
her
but
we
came
near
missing
it
that
connection
buckheath
put
in
for
me
the
evening
you
were
with
him
on
the
ridge
worked
loose
but
i
discovered
the
trouble
in
time
to
fix
it
remembrance
of
that
evening
and
of
the
swift
flight
of
the
motors
through
the
dusk
moonlight
made
johnnie
wonder
at
herself
and
her
present
position
she
was
roused
by
stoddard
voice
asking
are
you
interested
in
machinery
i
love
it
returned
johnnie
sincerely
i
never
did
get
enough
of
tinkerin
around
machines
if
i
was
ever
so
fortunate
as
to
own
a
sewing
machine
i
could
take
it
all
apart
and
clean
it
and
put
it
together
again
i
did
that
to
the
minister
wife
sewing
machine
down
at
bledsoe
when
it
got
out
of
order
she
said
i
knew
more
about
it
than
the
man
that
sold
it
to
her
would
you
like
to
run
the
car
came
the
next
query
would
she
like
to
the
countenance
of
simple
rapture
that
she
turned
to
him
was
reply
sufficient
well
look
at
my
hands
here
on
the
get
the
position
and
when
i
raise
one
put
yours
in
its
place
there
no
a
little
more
this
way
now
you
can
hold
it
better
the
other
one
right
smilingly
he
watched
her
like
a
grown
person
amusing
a
child
you
see
what
the
wheel
does
of
course
guides
now
when
they
had
run
ahead
for
some
minutes
do
you
want
to
go
faster
johnnie
laughed
up
at
him
through
thick
fair
lashes
looks
like
anybody
would
be
hard
to
suit
that
wanted
to
go
faster
than
this
she
apologized
but
if
the
machine
can
make
a
higher
speed
there
would
be
any
harm
in
just
running
that
way
for
a
spell
would
there
it
was
stoddard
turn
to
laugh
no
manner
of
harm
he
agreed
readily
well
you
advance
your
spark
and
open
the
throttle
that
speeds
her
up
this
is
the
spark
and
this
the
gas
here
then
you
shove
your
shifting
lever
see
here
it
is
over
to
the
next
speed
remember
that
any
time
you
shift
the
gears
have
to
pull
the
clutch
the
machine
has
to
gain
headway
on
one
speed
before
it
can
take
the
next
johnnie
nodded
soberly
her
intent
gaze
studied
the
mechanism
before
her
intelligently
we
going
a
heap
faster
now
she
suggested
in
a
moment
can
i
move
that
whatever
it
is
over
to
the
third
speed
yes
agreed
stoddard
here
a
good
long
straight
stretch
of
road
for
us
to
take
it
on
i
attend
to
the
horn
when
we
come
to
the
turn
up
there
we
must
make
anybody
horse
run
away
so
the
lesson
proceeded
he
showed
her
brake
and
clutch
he
gave
her
some
theoretical
knowledge
of
cranking
up
because
she
seemed
to
enjoy
it
as
a
child
enjoys
exploiting
the
possibilities
of
a
new
toy
up
and
up
they
went
the
sky
widening
and
brightening
above
them
hens
began
to
lead
forth
their
broods
overhead
a
hawk
wheeled
high
in
the
blue
uttering
his
querulous
cry
i
mighty
glad
i
came
the
girl
said
more
to
herself
than
to
the
man
at
her
side
this
is
the
most
like
flying
of
anything
that
ever
chanced
to
me
from
time
to
time
stoddard
had
sent
swift
sidelong
glances
at
his
companion
noting
the
bright
bent
head
the
purity
of
line
in
the
profile
above
the
the
intelligent
beauty
of
the
intent
eyes
with
long
lashes
almost
on
the
flushed
cheeks
he
wondered
at
her
born
amid
these
wide
cool
spaces
how
had
she
endured
for
a
week
the
fetid
atmosphere
of
the
factory
rooms
how
having
tested
it
could
she
look
forward
to
a
life
like
that
something
in
her
innocent
trust
choked
him
he
began
some
carefully
worded
inquiries
as
to
her
experience
in
the
mill
and
her
opinion
of
the
work
the
answers
partook
of
that
charm
which
always
clung
about
johnnie
she
told
him
of
mandy
and
missing
no
shade
of
the
humour
there
was
in
the
meacham
girl
managed
to
make
the
description
pathetic
she
described
pap
himes
and
his
aptly
deftly
and
left
it
funny
though
a
sympathetic
listener
could
feel
the
tragedy
beneath
presently
they
met
the
first
with
its
load
of
worshippers
for
the
little
mountain
church
beyond
as
these
came
out
of
a
small
side
road
and
caught
sight
of
the
car
the
bony
old
horses
jibbed
and
shied
and
took
all
the
driver
skill
and
a
large
portion
of
his
vocabulary
to
carry
them
safely
past
the
children
staring
the
women
pulling
their
sunbonnets
about
their
faces
and
looking
down
something
in
the
sight
brought
home
to
johnnie
the
incongruity
of
her
present
position
on
the
instant
a
drop
of
rain
splashed
upon
the
back
of
her
hand
there
she
cried
in
a
contrite
voice
i
knew
mighty
well
and
good
that
it
was
going
to
rain
and
i
ought
to
have
named
it
to
you
because
you
town
folks
do
understand
the
weather
as
well
as
we
do
i
ought
not
to
have
let
you
come
on
up
here
we
have
to
turn
and
run
for
it
said
stoddard
laughing
a
little
i
wish
i
had
the
hood
put
on
this
morning
as
he
surveyed
the
narrow
way
in
which
he
had
to
turn
is
it
wider
beyond
here
do
you
remember
there
a
bluff
up
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
that
you
could
run
under
and
be
as
dry
as
if
you
were
in
the
shed
at
home
said
johnnie
this
wo
last
long
do
you
want
to
try
it
you
are
the
pilot
stoddard
declared
promptly
resigning
the
wheel
once
more
to
her
hands
if
it
a
bad
place
you
might
let
me
take
the
car
in
rain
in
the
mountains
has
a
trick
of
coming
with
the
suddenness
of
an
overturned
bucket
johnnie
sent
the
car
ahead
at
what
she
considered
a
rapid
pace
till
stoddard
unceremoniously
took
the
wheel
from
her
and
shoved
the
speed
clutch
over
to
the
third
speed
i
mighty
sorry
i
was
so
careless
and
did
warn
you
about
the
rain
she
declared
with
shining
eyes
as
her
hair
blew
back
and
her
colour
rose
at
the
rapid
motion
but
this
is
fine
i
believe
that
if
i
should
ever
be
so
fortunate
as
to
own
an
automobile
i
want
to
fly
like
this
every
minute
of
the
time
i
was
in
it
as
she
spoke
they
swept
beneath
the
overhanging
rocks
and
a
great
curtain
of
virginia
creeper
and
fell
behind
them
half
screening
them
from
the
road
and
from
the
deluge
which
now
broke
more
fiercely
for
five
minutes
the
world
was
blotted
out
in
rain
with
these
two
watching
its
gray
swirls
and
listening
to
its
insistent
drumming
safe
and
dry
in
their
cave
nothing
ripens
intimacy
so
rapidly
as
a
common
mishap
also
two
people
seem
much
to
each
other
as
they
await
alone
the
ceasing
of
the
rain
or
the
coming
of
the
delayed
boat
this
wo
last
long
johnnie
repeated
we
wo
dare
to
start
out
when
it
first
stops
but
there
come
a
little
shower
after
that
and
then
i
think
we
have
a
fair
day
do
you
know
the
saying
before
seven
quit
before
eleven
well
it
showered
twice
just
as
day
was
breaking
and
i
had
to
wait
under
a
tree
till
it
was
over
the
big
drops
lengthened
themselves
as
they
came
down
into
tiny
javelins
and
struck
upon
the
rocks
with
a
splash
the
roar
and
drumming
in
the
forest
made
a
soft
blurring
undertone
of
sound
the
first
rain
lasted
longer
than
johnnie
had
counted
on
and
the
shower
was
slow
in
making
its
appearance
the
two
talked
with
interest
strangely
enough
johnnie
consadine
who
had
no
knowledge
of
any
other
life
except
through
a
few
books
appreciated
the
values
of
this
mountain
existence
with
almost
the
detached
view
of
an
outsider
her
knowledge
of
it
was
therefore
more
assorted
and
available
and
stoddard
listened
to
her
eagerly
but
what
made
you
think
you
like
to
work
in
a
cotton
mill
he
asked
suddenly
after
all
were
you
maybe
better
off
up
in
these
mountains
and
then
and
there
johnnie
strove
to
put
into
exact
and
intelligent
words
what
she
had
possessed
and
what
she
had
lacked
in
the
home
of
her
childhood
unconsciously
she
told
him
more
than
was
in
the
mere
words
he
got
the
situation
as
to
the
visionary
kindly
father
with
a
turn
for
book
learning
and
a
liking
for
enterprises
that
appealed
to
his
imagination
uncle
pros
and
the
silver
mine
were
always
touched
upon
with
the
tender
kindness
johnnie
felt
for
the
old
man
and
his
quest
but
the
little
mother
and
the
children
ah
it
was
here
that
the
listener
found
johnnie
incentive
stoddard
she
concluded
there
was
a
bit
of
hope
of
schooling
for
the
children
unless
i
could
get
out
and
work
in
the
factory
i
think
it
a
splendid
chance
for
a
girl
i
think
any
girl
that
would
take
such
a
chance
would
be
mighty
mean
and
gray
stoddard
revolved
this
conception
of
a
chance
in
the
world
in
his
mind
for
some
time
i
did
get
some
schooling
she
told
him
you
would
think
it
to
hear
me
talk
because
i
careless
but
i
been
taught
and
i
can
do
better
yet
if
i
do
see
to
it
how
am
i
to
know
that
the
children
will
have
as
much
even
as
i
had
mountain
air
is
mighty
pure
and
healthy
and
the
water
up
here
is
the
finest
you
ever
drank
but
only
for
the
body
of
course
there
beauty
all
about
you
there
was
never
anything
more
sightly
than
big
unaka
and
the
ridges
that
run
from
it
and
the
sky
and
the
big
woods
and
all
and
yet
human
beings
have
got
to
have
more
than
that
i
aim
to
make
a
chance
for
the
children
are
you
going
to
bring
them
down
and
let
them
work
in
the
mills
with
you
stoddard
asked
in
a
perfectly
colourless
tone
johnnie
looked
embarrassed
her
week
in
the
cotton
mill
had
fixed
indelibly
on
her
mind
the
picture
of
the
mill
child
straggling
to
work
in
the
gray
dawn
sleepy
shivering
unkempt
of
the
young
things
creeping
up
and
down
the
aisles
between
the
endlessly
turning
spools
dully
regarding
the
frames
to
see
that
the
threads
were
not
fouled
or
broken
of
the
tired
little
groups
as
they
pressed
close
to
the
shut
windows
neglecting
their
work
to
stare
out
into
a
world
of
blue
sky
and
blowing
airs
a
world
they
could
see
but
not
enter
and
no
breath
of
which
could
come
in
to
them
and
so
she
looked
embarrassed
she
was
afraid
that
memory
of
those
tired
little
faces
would
show
in
her
own
countenance
her
hands
on
the
trembled
she
remembered
that
stoddard
was
as
shade
had
said
one
of
the
bosses
in
the
hardwick
mill
it
seemed
too
terrible
to
offend
him
he
certainly
thought
no
ill
of
having
children
employed
she
must
not
seem
to
criticize
him
she
answered
evasively
well
of
course
they
might
do
that
i
did
think
of
it
before
i
went
down
there
before
you
went
to
work
in
the
mills
yourself
supplied
stoddard
again
in
that
colourless
tone
ye
yes
hesitated
johnnie
but
you
must
get
the
idea
that
i
love
my
work
because
i
do
you
see
the
children
have
had
any
schooling
yet
and
well
i
a
great
big
stout
somebody
and
it
looks
like
i
the
one
to
work
in
the
mill
she
turned
to
him
fleetingly
a
countenance
of
appeal
and
perplexity
it
seemed
indeed
anything
but
certain
that
she
was
one
to
work
in
the
mill
there
was
something
almost
grotesque
in
the
idea
which
made
stoddard
smile
a
little
at
her
earnestness
i
like
to
talk
it
over
with
you
when
you
been
at
work
there
longer
he
found
himself
saying
you
see
i
studying
mill
conditions
from
one
side
and
you
studying
them
from
the
opposite
perhaps
we
could
help
each
other
i
sure
will
tell
you
what
i
find
out
agreed
johnnie
heartily
i
reckon
you
want
to
know
how
the
work
seems
to
me
at
the
side
of
such
as
i
was
used
to
in
the
mountains
but
i
hope
you
wo
inquire
how
long
it
took
me
to
learn
for
i
afraid
i
going
to
make
a
poor
record
if
you
was
to
ask
me
how
much
i
was
able
to
earn
there
and
how
much
back
on
unaka
i
could
make
a
good
report
for
the
mill
on
that
because
that
all
that
the
matter
with
the
mountains
they
a
beautiful
place
to
live
but
a
body
ca
hardly
earn
a
cent
work
as
they
may
johnnie
forgot
herself
she
was
always
doing
that
and
she
talked
freely
and
well
it
was
as
inevitable
that
she
should
be
drawn
to
gray
stoddard
as
that
she
should
desire
the
clothing
and
culture
miss
lydia
possessed
for
the
present
one
aspiration
struck
her
as
quite
as
innocent
as
the
other
stoddard
had
not
yet
emerged
from
the
starry
constellations
among
which
she
set
him
to
take
form
as
a
young
man
a
person
who
might
indeed
return
her
regard
her
emotions
were
in
that
nebulous
formative
stage
when
but
a
touch
would
be
needed
to
show
her
whither
the
regard
tended
yet
till
that
touch
should
come
she
as
unashamedly
adored
gray
as
any
child
of
five
could
have
done
it
was
not
till
they
were
well
down
the
road
to
cottonville
that
she
realized
the
bald
fact
that
she
a
mill
girl
was
riding
in
an
automobile
with
one
of
the
mill
owners
she
was
casting
about
for
some
reasonable
phrase
in
which
to
clothe
the
statement
that
it
would
be
better
he
should
stop
the
car
and
let
her
out
she
had
parted
her
lips
to
ask
him
to
take
the
wheel
when
they
rounded
a
turn
and
came
upon
a
company
of
from
the
village
below
behind
them
in
a
giggling
group
strolled
a
dozen
mill
girls
in
their
sunday
best
johnnie
had
sight
of
mandy
meacham
fixing
eyes
of
terrified
admiration
upon
her
then
she
nodded
in
reply
to
shade
buckheath
angry
stare
and
a
rattle
of
wheels
apprized
her
that
a
carriage
was
passing
on
the
other
side
this
vehicle
contained
the
entire
hardwick
family
with
lydia
sessions
turning
long
to
look
her
incredulous
amazement
back
at
them
from
her
seat
beside
her
it
was
all
over
in
a
moment
the
had
debouched
upon
the
long
wooden
bridge
which
crossed
the
ravine
to
their
quarters
the
girls
were
going
on
mandy
meacham
hanging
back
and
staring
a
tree
finally
shut
out
miss
sessions
accusing
countenance
please
stop
and
let
me
out
here
said
johnnie
in
a
scarcely
audible
voice
when
stoddard
would
have
remonstrated
or
asked
why
his
lips
were
closed
by
sight
of
her
daunted
miserable
face
he
knew
as
well
as
she
the
mad
imprudence
of
the
thing
which
they
had
done
and
blamed
himself
roundly
with
it
all
i
not
forget
to
bring
the
books
we
were
talking
of
he
made
haste
to
say
he
picked
up
the
little
basket
from
the
floor
of
the
car
you
better
keep
the
flowers
in
that
johnnie
told
him
lifelessly
her
innocent
dream
was
broken
into
by
a
cruel
reality
she
was
struggling
blindly
under
the
weight
of
all
her
little
disapprobation
you
let
me
return
the
basket
when
i
bring
you
the
books
gray
suggested
helplessly
i
do
know
johnnie
hesitated
then
as
a
sudden
inspiration
came
to
her
mandy
meacham
said
she
try
to
get
me
into
a
club
for
girls
that
miss
sessions
has
she
said
miss
sessions
would
lend
me
books
maybe
you
might
just
leave
them
with
her
i
sure
i
should
be
mighty
proud
to
have
them
i
know
i
love
to
read
them
but
well
you
might
just
leave
them
with
her
a
little
satiric
sparkle
leaped
to
life
in
stoddard
eyes
he
looked
at
the
innocent
upraised
face
in
wonder
the
most
experienced
manoeuverer
of
society
legion
could
not
have
handled
a
difficult
situation
more
deftly
the
very
thing
he
said
cheerily
i
talk
to
miss
sessions
about
it
chapter
viii
of
the
use
of
wings
i
told
you
i
speak
a
good
word
for
you
shouted
mandy
meacham
putting
her
lips
down
close
to
johnnie
ear
where
she
struggled
and
fought
with
her
looms
amid
the
deafening
clamour
of
the
weaving
room
the
girl
looked
up
flushed
tired
but
eagerly
receptive
yes
her
red
lips
shaped
the
word
to
the
other
eyes
though
no
sound
could
make
itself
heard
above
that
din
except
such
eldritch
shrieks
as
mandy
i
done
it
i
got
you
a
invite
to
some
doin
at
the
uplift
club
again
johnnie
nodded
and
shaped
yes
with
her
lips
she
added
something
which
might
have
been
thank
you
the
adorable
smile
that
accompanied
it
said
as
much
mandy
watched
her
fascinated
as
the
lithe
strong
young
figure
bent
and
strained
to
correct
a
crease
in
the
web
where
it
turned
the
roll
they
never
saw
anything
like
you
in
their
born
days
i
bet
she
yelled
i
never
did
you
awful
quare
but
somehow
i
sorter
like
ye
and
she
scuttled
back
to
her
looms
as
the
room
boss
came
in
a
weaver
works
by
the
piece
but
mandy
had
been
reproved
too
often
for
slovenly
methods
not
to
know
that
she
might
be
fined
for
neglect
her
looms
stood
where
she
could
continually
get
the
newcomer
figure
against
the
light
with
its
swift
motion
its
supple
curves
and
the
brave
carriage
of
the
head
the
sight
gave
mandy
a
curious
satisfaction
as
though
it
uttered
what
she
would
fain
have
said
to
the
classes
above
her
hers
was
something
the
feeling
which
the
private
in
the
ranks
has
for
the
who
carries
the
colours
aloft
or
the
dashing
officer
who
leads
the
charge
johnnie
was
the
challenge
she
would
have
flung
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
i
bet
if
you
put
one
of
miss
lyddy
dresses
on
her
she
look
nobby
mandy
ruminated
addressing
her
looms
that
what
she
would
she
have
all
f
fa
faded
away
as
the
feller
says
and
so
it
came
about
that
the
next
day
johnnie
consadine
did
not
go
to
the
mill
at
all
but
spent
the
morning
washing
and
ironing
her
one
light
print
dress
it
was
as
coarse
almost
as
and
the
blue
dots
on
it
had
paled
till
they
made
a
suspicious
speckle
not
unlike
mildew
yet
when
she
had
combed
her
thick
fair
hair
rolled
it
back
from
the
white
brow
and
braided
it
to
a
coronet
round
her
head
as
she
had
seen
that
of
the
lady
on
the
porch
at
the
palace
of
pleasure
when
cleansed
and
smooth
she
put
the
frock
on
one
forgot
the
dress
in
the
youth
of
her
the
hope
the
glorious
expectation
there
was
in
that
eager
face
the
ladies
assisting
in
miss
lydia
sessions
uplift
club
for
work
among
the
mill
girls
were
almost
all
young
and
youngish
women
the
mothers
in
israel
attacked
the
more
serious
problems
of
orphanages
winter
supplies
of
coal
and
clothing
for
the
destitute
but
their
souls
must
be
fed
too
miss
lydia
asserted
as
she
recruited
her
helpers
for
the
uplift
work
their
souls
must
be
fed
and
who
can
reach
the
souls
of
these
young
girls
so
well
as
we
who
are
near
their
own
age
and
who
have
had
time
for
culture
and
spiritual
growth
it
was
a
good
theory
perhaps
one
may
say
that
it
remains
a
good
theory
the
manner
of
uplifting
was
to
select
a
certain
number
of
mill
girls
whom
it
was
deemed
well
to
help
approach
them
on
the
subject
and
if
they
appeared
amenable
pay
a
substitute
to
take
charge
of
their
looms
while
those
in
process
of
being
uplifted
attended
a
meeting
of
the
club
the
gathering
to
which
johnnie
was
bidden
was
held
in
honour
of
a
lady
from
london
who
had
written
a
book
on
some
subject
which
it
was
thought
ought
to
appeal
to
workingwomen
this
lady
intended
to
address
the
company
and
to
mingle
with
them
and
get
their
views
most
of
those
present
being
quite
unfurnished
with
any
views
whatever
on
the
problem
she
discussed
her
position
was
something
that
of
a
in
a
moneyless
crowd
but
of
this
she
was
fortunately
and
happily
unaware
mandy
meacham
regarded
johnnie
preparation
for
the
function
with
some
disfavour
ef
you
fix
up
like
that
she
remonstrated
you
bound
to
look
too
nice
to
suit
miss
lyddy
they
wo
be
no
men
thar
i
goin
to
wear
my
workin
dress
and
tell
her
i
had
nary
minute
nor
nary
cent
to
do
other
johnnie
laughed
a
little
at
this
as
though
it
were
intended
for
a
joke
but
i
did
have
time
she
objected
miss
sessions
would
pay
a
substitute
for
the
whole
day
though
i
told
her
i
only
need
the
afternoon
for
the
party
i
think
it
was
mighty
good
of
her
and
it
as
little
as
i
can
do
to
make
myself
look
as
nice
as
i
can
you
ai
got
the
sense
you
was
born
with
fretted
mandy
them
thar
kind
ladies
ai
for
you
to
look
so
fine
they
attend
to
all
the
fine
lookin
theirselves
what
they
want
is
to
know
how
bad
off
you
air
an
to
have
you
say
how
much
what
they
have
did
or
give
has
helped
you
such
interchange
of
views
brought
the
two
girls
to
the
door
of
the
little
frame
chapel
given
over
for
the
day
to
uplift
work
within
it
rose
a
bustle
and
clatter
a
hum
of
voices
that
spoke
a
frilling
of
nervous
shrill
laughter
to
edge
the
sound
and
back
of
that
the
clink
of
dishes
from
a
rear
room
where
refreshments
were
being
prepared
miss
sessions
near
the
door
had
a
receiving
line
quite
in
the
manner
of
any
reception
she
herself
in
a
blouse
of
marvellous
daintiness
and
sweeping
skirts
stood
beside
the
visitor
from
london
to
present
her
to
this
day
johnnie
is
uncertain
as
to
where
the
wonderful
blue
silk
frock
of
that
lady
from
abroad
was
fastened
though
she
gave
the
undivided
efforts
of
sharp
young
eyes
and
an
inquiring
mind
to
the
problem
a
good
portion
of
the
time
while
it
was
within
her
view
the
englishwoman
was
called
archbold
and
on
her
other
hand
stood
a
tall
slim
lady
with
long
eyes
prematurely
gray
hair
which
had
plainly
been
red
and
an
odd
little
twist
to
her
smile
this
was
hexter
wife
of
the
owner
of
the
big
woollen
mills
across
the
creek
and
only
bidden
in
to
assist
the
uplift
work
because
the
position
of
her
husband
gave
her
much
power
these
with
the
misses
burchard
daughters
of
the
rector
formed
the
reception
committee
i
am
so
charmed
to
see
you
here
miss
lydia
smiled
as
they
entered
it
was
part
of
her
theory
to
treat
the
mill
girls
exactly
as
she
would
members
of
her
own
circle
mandy
being
old
at
the
business
possessed
herself
of
the
hand
presented
but
johnnie
only
looked
at
it
in
astonishment
uncertain
whether
miss
lydia
meant
to
shake
hands
or
pat
her
on
the
head
yet
when
she
did
finally
divine
what
was
intended
the
quality
of
her
apologetic
smile
ought
to
have
atoned
for
her
lapse
i
sure
proud
to
be
here
with
she
said
looks
like
to
me
you
are
mighty
kind
to
strangers
the
ineradicable
dignity
of
the
true
mountaineer
who
has
always
been
as
good
as
the
best
in
his
environment
preserved
johnnie
from
any
embarrassment
any
tendency
to
shrink
or
cringe
her
beauty
in
the
print
gown
was
like
a
thing
released
and
as
miss
sessions
might
have
put
it
rampant
gray
stoddard
had
gone
directly
to
lydia
sessions
with
his
proffers
of
books
and
his
suggestions
for
johnnie
the
explanation
of
how
the
girl
came
to
be
riding
in
his
car
that
sunday
morning
was
neither
as
full
nor
as
penitent
as
miss
lydia
could
have
wished
yet
it
did
recognize
the
impropriety
of
the
act
and
was
in
so
far
satisfactory
miss
sessions
made
haste
to
form
an
alliance
with
the
young
man
for
the
special
upliftment
of
johnnie
consadine
she
would
have
greatly
preferred
to
interest
him
in
mandy
meacham
but
beggars
can
not
be
choosers
and
she
took
what
she
could
get
whom
have
we
here
demanded
the
lady
from
london
leaning
across
and
peering
at
johnnie
with
friendly
eyes
why
what
a
blooming
girl
to
be
sure
you
have
been
long
from
the
country
venture
to
guess
my
dear
johnnie
blushed
and
dimpled
at
being
so
kindly
welcomed
the
mountain
people
are
undemonstrative
in
speech
and
action
and
that
my
dear
seemed
wonderful
i
come
from
away
up
in
the
mountains
she
said
softly
from
away
up
in
the
mountains
repeated
the
englishwoman
her
smiling
gaze
dwelling
on
johnnie
radiant
face
why
yes
so
one
would
conceive
well
you
must
lose
all
those
pretty
roses
in
the
mill
down
here
she
was
a
visitor
remember
residents
of
cottonville
never
admitted
that
roses
or
anything
else
desirable
could
be
lost
in
the
mills
i
not
said
johnnie
sturdily
i
goin
to
earn
my
way
and
send
for
mother
and
the
children
if
hard
work
do
it
but
i
a
mighty
big
stout
healthy
somebody
and
i
aim
to
keep
so
archbold
patted
the
tall
young
shoulder
as
she
turned
to
mandy
meacham
whom
miss
lydia
was
eager
to
put
through
her
paces
for
the
benefit
of
the
lady
from
london
is
that
the
girl
stoddard
was
speaking
to
me
about
she
inquired
in
a
whisper
as
johnnie
moved
away
i
think
it
must
be
he
said
she
was
such
a
beauty
and
i
scarcely
believe
there
could
be
two
like
her
in
one
town
such
a
type
were
stoddard
exact
words
i
believe
returned
miss
sessions
a
little
frostily
yes
john
consadine
is
quite
a
marked
type
of
the
mountaineer
she
is
as
she
said
to
you
a
stout
healthy
creature
and
i
understand
very
industrious
i
approve
of
john
she
approved
of
john
but
she
addressed
herself
to
exploiting
mandy
and
the
lady
in
the
blue
silk
frock
learned
how
poor
and
helpless
the
meacham
woman
had
been
before
she
got
in
to
the
mill
work
how
greatly
the
uplift
club
had
benefited
her
with
many
interesting
details
yet
as
the
english
lady
went
from
group
to
group
in
company
with
miss
lydia
and
hexter
wife
her
quick
eyes
wandered
across
the
room
to
where
a
bright
head
rose
a
little
taller
than
its
fellows
and
occasional
bursts
of
laughter
told
that
johnnie
was
in
a
merry
mood
the
threadbare
attempt
at
a
reception
was
gotten
through
laboriously
the
girls
were
finally
settled
in
orderly
rows
and
archbold
led
to
the
platform
the
talk
she
had
prepared
for
them
was
upon
aspiration
it
was
an
essay
in
fact
and
she
had
delivered
it
successfully
before
many
women
clubs
she
is
not
to
be
blamed
that
the
language
was
as
absolutely
above
the
comprehension
of
her
hearers
as
though
it
had
been
greek
she
was
a
busy
woman
with
other
aims
and
activities
than
those
of
working
among
the
masses
miss
lydia
had
heard
her
present
talk
fancied
it
and
thought
it
would
be
the
very
thing
for
the
uplift
club
for
thirty
minutes
johnnie
sat
concentrating
desperately
on
every
sentence
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
lady
from
london
trying
harder
to
understand
than
she
had
ever
tried
to
do
anything
in
her
life
she
put
all
her
quick
young
mind
and
avid
soul
into
the
struggle
to
receive
though
piercingly
aware
every
instant
of
the
difference
between
her
attire
and
that
of
the
women
who
had
bidden
her
there
noting
acutely
variations
between
their
language
and
hers
their
voices
their
gestures
and
hers
these
were
the
women
of
gray
stoddard
world
such
were
his
feminine
associates
here
then
must
be
her
models
mandy
and
her
likes
got
from
the
talk
perhaps
nothing
at
all
except
that
rich
people
might
have
what
they
liked
if
they
wanted
it
that
at
least
was
miss
meacham
summing
up
of
the
matter
when
she
went
home
that
night
but
to
johnnie
some
of
the
sentences
remained
you
struggle
and
climb
and
strive
said
archbold
earnestly
when
if
you
only
knew
it
you
have
wings
and
what
are
the
wings
of
the
soul
the
wings
of
the
soul
are
aspiration
oh
that
we
would
spread
them
and
fly
to
the
heights
our
longing
eyes
behold
the
heights
we
dream
of
when
we
can
not
see
them
the
heights
we
foolishly
and
mistakenly
expect
to
climb
some
day
again
johnnie
saw
herself
coming
down
the
ridge
at
shade
side
descending
into
the
shadow
stepping
closer
to
the
droning
mills
while
above
her
the
palace
of
pleasure
swam
in
its
golden
glory
and
these
who
were
privileged
to
do
so
went
out
and
in
and
laughed
and
were
happy
were
such
heights
as
that
what
this
woman
meant
johnnie
had
let
it
typify
to
her
the
heights
to
which
she
intended
to
climb
was
it
indeed
possible
to
fly
to
them
instead
the
talk
ended
she
sat
so
long
with
bent
head
that
miss
sessions
finally
came
round
and
took
the
unoccupied
chair
beside
her
are
you
thinking
it
over
john
she
inquired
with
that
odd
little
note
of
hostility
which
she
could
never
quite
keep
out
of
her
voice
when
she
addressed
this
girl
yes
replied
johnnie
meekly
several
who
were
talking
together
in
the
vicinity
relinquished
their
conversation
to
listen
to
the
two
hexter
shot
one
of
her
quaint
crooked
smiles
at
the
lady
from
london
and
with
a
silent
gesture
bade
her
hearken
i
think
these
things
are
most
important
for
you
girls
who
have
to
earn
your
daily
bread
miss
sessions
condescended
daily
bread
echoed
johnnie
softly
she
loved
fine
phrases
as
she
loved
fine
clothes
i
know
where
that
comes
from
it
in
the
prayer
about
bread
and
kingdom
and
the
power
and
the
glory
do
you
think
those
are
beautiful
words
miss
lydia
the
and
the
glory
miss
sessions
lips
sucked
in
with
that
singular
expression
of
condemnation
which
was
becoming
fairly
familiar
to
johnnie
oh
john
she
said
reprovingly
bread
is
all
we
have
anything
to
do
with
do
you
remember
that
it
says
be
the
kingdom
and
the
power
and
the
glory
thine
john
thine
yes
returned
johnnie
submissively
but
it
was
in
her
heart
that
certain
upon
this
earth
had
their
share
of
kingdoms
and
powers
and
the
glories
and
although
she
uttered
that
submissive
yes
her
young
heart
registered
a
vow
to
achieve
its
own
slice
of
these
things
as
well
as
of
daily
bread
did
you
enjoy
archbold
talk
i
thought
it
very
fine
miss
sessions
pursued
it
sure
was
that
sighed
johnnie
i
do
know
as
i
understand
it
all
every
word
i
tried
to
but
maybe
i
got
some
of
it
wrong
what
is
it
you
do
understand
john
inquired
miss
lydia
patronizingly
ask
me
i
explain
anything
you
care
to
know
about
johnnie
turned
to
her
too
desperately
in
earnest
to
note
the
other
listeners
to
the
conversation
why
that
about
stretching
out
the
wings
of
your
spirit
and
flying
do
you
believe
that
i
certainly
do
miss
sessions
said
brightly
as
delighted
at
remembering
part
of
the
visitor
words
as
a
small
boy
when
he
has
taught
his
terrier
to
walk
on
its
hind
legs
then
if
a
body
wants
a
thing
bad
enough
and
keeps
on
it
oh
just
awful
is
that
aspiration
will
the
thing
you
want
come
to
pass
miss
sessions
deemed
it
necessary
to
qualify
her
statement
to
this
fiery
and
exact
young
questioner
you
have
to
want
the
right
thing
of
course
john
you
have
to
want
the
right
thing
yes
agreed
johnnie
heartily
and
i
it
was
certainly
the
right
thing
if
it
was
what
good
folks
like
you
want
miss
sessions
flushed
yet
she
looked
pleased
aware
if
johnnie
was
not
of
the
number
of
listeners
here
was
her
work
of
uplift
among
the
mill
girls
being
justified
i
oh
really
i
could
set
myself
up
as
a
pattern
she
said
modestly
but
you
are
johnnie
assured
her
warmly
there
ai
anybody
in
this
room
i
rather
go
by
as
by
you
the
fine
gray
eyes
had
been
travelling
from
neck
to
belt
from
shoulder
to
wrist
of
the
lady
who
was
enlightening
her
i
think
i
never
in
all
my
life
seen
anything
more
sightly
than
that
you
she
murmured
softly
where
how
might
a
person
come
by
such
a
one
if
you
thought
that
my
wishing
and
aspiring
would
ever
bring
me
such
as
that
i
sure
try
there
rose
a
titter
about
the
two
it
spread
and
swelled
till
the
whole
assembly
was
in
a
gale
of
laughter
miss
sessions
becoming
blush
deepened
to
the
tint
of
angry
mortification
she
looked
about
and
assumed
the
air
of
a
schoolmistress
with
a
room
full
of
noisy
pupils
but
johnnie
her
cheeks
pink
too
first
swept
them
all
with
an
astonished
gaze
which
flung
the
long
lashes
up
in
such
a
wide
curve
of
innocence
as
made
her
eyes
bewitching
then
joined
it
and
laughed
as
loud
as
any
of
them
at
she
knew
not
what
it
was
the
one
touch
to
put
her
with
the
majority
and
leave
her
mentor
stranded
in
a
bleak
minority
miss
sessions
objected
to
the
position
oh
john
she
said
severely
so
soon
as
she
could
be
heard
above
the
giggles
how
you
have
misunderstood
me
and
archbold
and
all
we
intended
to
bring
to
you
what
is
a
mere
blouse
like
this
to
the
uplift
the
outlook
the
development
we
were
striving
to
offer
i
confess
i
am
deeply
disappointed
in
you
this
sobered
johnnie
instantly
i
sorry
she
said
bending
forward
to
lay
a
wistful
penitent
hand
on
that
of
miss
sessions
i
try
to
understand
better
i
reckon
right
dumb
and
you
have
to
have
a
lot
of
patience
with
me
i
rightly
know
what
to
aspire
after
the
amende
was
so
sweetly
made
that
even
lydia
sessions
still
exceedingly
employed
at
being
pictorially
chagrined
over
the
depravity
of
her
neophyte
could
but
be
appeased
i
try
to
furnish
you
more
suitable
objects
for
your
ambition
she
murmured
virtuously
but
the
lady
with
the
gray
hair
and
the
odd
little
twist
to
her
smile
now
leaned
forward
and
took
a
hand
in
the
conversation
see
here
lydia
hexter
remonstrated
in
crisp
tones
what
the
matter
with
the
girl
aspiring
after
a
blouse
like
yours
you
took
a
lot
of
trouble
and
spent
a
lot
of
money
to
get
that
one
i
noticed
you
were
careful
to
tell
me
it
was
imported
because
i
could
see
the
and
find
out
that
detail
for
myself
that
blouse
is
a
dream
it
a
dream
if
it
good
enough
aspiration
for
you
or
me
why
not
for
this
girl
oh
but
hexter
murmured
the
mortified
miss
sessions
glancing
uneasily
toward
the
contingent
which
was
listening
eagerly
and
then
at
the
speaker
of
the
day
i
am
sure
archbold
will
agree
with
me
that
it
would
be
a
gross
material
idea
to
aspire
after
blouses
and
when
the
poor
child
needs
er
other
things
so
much
more
yes
i
do
that
conceded
johnnie
dutifully
those
changeful
eyes
of
hers
full
of
pensive
denied
desire
as
they
swept
the
dainty
gowns
of
the
women
before
her
i
do
you
right
i
would
think
of
spending
my
money
for
a
like
that
when
i
mighty
near
as
barefoot
as
a
rabbit
this
minute
and
the
little
back
home
has
to
have
every
cent
i
can
save
i
just
thought
that
if
beautiful
wishes
was
ever
really
coming
true
if
it
was
right
and
proper
for
a
person
to
have
beautiful
wishes
i
like
her
voice
faltered
into
discouraged
silence
tears
gathered
and
hung
thick
on
her
lashes
miss
sessions
sent
a
beseeching
look
toward
the
lady
from
london
archbold
stepped
accommodatingly
into
the
breach
all
aspiration
is
good
she
said
gently
i
should
be
discouraged
because
it
took
a
rather
concrete
form
johnnie
eyes
were
upon
her
face
trying
to
understand
a
concrete
form
she
imagined
might
allude
to
the
fact
that
miss
sessions
had
a
better
figure
than
she
hexter
glad
of
an
ally
tossed
that
incorrigible
gray
head
of
hers
and
dashed
into
the
conversation
once
more
if
i
were
you
johnnie
i
just
aspire
as
hard
as
i
could
in
that
direction
she
said
recklessly
her
mischievous
glance
upon
the
flowing
lines
of
johnnie
young
shoulders
and
throat
a
blouse
like
that
would
be
awfully
fetching
on
you
you
look
lovely
in
it
why
should
you
aspire
to
it
maybe
you
have
one
just
as
pretty
before
the
style
changes
i
am
sure
you
nice
enough
and
enough
for
the
best
in
the
way
of
purple
and
fine
linen
to
come
to
you
by
the
law
of
attraction
do
you
believe
in
the
law
of
attraction
mrs
archbold
lydia
sessions
got
up
and
moved
away
in
shocked
silence
hexter
was
a
good
deal
of
a
thorn
in
her
flesh
and
she
only
tolerated
her
because
of
hexter
and
his
position
after
the
retreating
and
disaffected
hostess
came
archbold
voice
with
a
thread
of
laughter
in
it
i
believe
in
the
law
of
such
attraction
as
this
girl
has
she
said
kindly
what
is
it
your
walt
whitman
says
about
the
fluid
and
attaching
character
that
all
hearts
yearn
toward
it
that
old
and
young
must
give
it
love
that
is
my
dear
turning
explainingly
to
johnnie
the
character
which
gives
much
love
takes
much
interest
in
those
about
it
makes
itself
one
with
other
people
and
their
affairs
do
you
get
my
meaning
i
think
i
understand
half
whispered
johnnie
glowing
eyes
on
the
face
of
the
speaker
do
you
mean
that
i
am
anything
like
that
i
do
love
everybody
most
but
how
could
i
help
it
when
everybody
is
so
good
and
kind
to
me
the
glances
of
the
older
women
met
across
the
bright
head
she
wo
have
much
use
for
feet
to
climb
with
hexter
summed
it
up
taking
her
figure
from
the
talk

in
the
afternoon
got
wings

puzzled
johnnie

only
smile
from
one
to

mandy

chapter
ix
a
bit
of
metal
in
the
valleys
of
tennessee
spring
has
a
trick
of
dropping
down
on
the
world
like
a
steaming
wet
blanket
the
season
that
johnnie
consadine
went
to
work
in
the
mills
at
cottonville
may
came
in
with
warm
rains
stifling
nights
followed
sultry
drenching
days
till
vegetation
everywhere
sprouted
unwholesomely
and
the
mountain
slopes
had
almost
the
reek
of
tropic
jungles
yet
the
girl
performed
the
labours
of
a
factory
weaver
with
almost
passionate
enthusiasm
and
devotion
always
and
always
she
was
looking
beyond
the
mere
present
moment
if
tending
loom
was
the
road
which
led
to
the
power
and
the
glory
what
need
to
complain
that
it
the
mere
road
was
but
dull
earth
she
tried
conscientiously
to
do
and
be
exactly
what
lydia
sessions
seemed
to
want
gray
stoddard
occasional
spoken
word
or
the
more
lengthy
written
messages
he
had
taken
to
putting
in
the
books
he
sent
her
seemed
to
demand
of
her
nothing
but
always
inspired
to
much
for
all
his
disposition
to
keep
hands
off
the
personal
development
of
his
friends
perhaps
on
account
of
it
gray
made
an
excellent
teacher
and
these
writings
the
garnered
grain
the
gist
of
his
own
wide
culture
were
the
very
sinews
for
the
race
johnnie
was
setting
out
on
she
began
to
intelligently
guard
her
speech
her
manner
her
very
thoughts
conforming
them
to
what
she
knew
of
his
ideals
miss
striving
to
build
up
an
imitation
lady
on
the
sincere
foundation
johnnie
offered
appealed
less
to
the
girl
and
had
therefore
less
effect
but
she
immediately
responded
to
stoddard
methods
tucking
in
to
the
books
she
returned
written
queries
or
records
of
perplexity
which
gradually
expanded
into
notes
expressions
of
her
own
awakened
thought
and
even
fancies
which
held
from
the
first
a
quaint
charm
and
individuality
the
long
hot
days
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
did
seem
to
the
creature
interminable
and
stifling
perspiration
dripped
from
white
faces
as
the
operatives
stood
listlessly
at
their
looms
or
the
children
straggled
back
and
forth
in
the
narrow
lanes
between
the
frames
tending
the
endlessly
turning
spools
the
hardwick
mill
had
both
spinning
and
weaving
departments
administrative
ability
is
as
much
a
native
gift
as
the
poet
voice
or
the
actor
grace
and
the
managers
of
any
large
business
are
always
on
the
lookout
for
it
before
johnnie
consadine
had
been
two
months
in
the
factory
she
was
given
charge
of
a
spinning
room
but
the
dignity
of
the
new
position
even
the
increase
of
pay
had
a
cloud
upon
it
she
was
beginning
to
understand
the
enmity
there
is
between
the
soulless
factory
and
the
human
tide
that
feeds
its
life
she
knew
now
that
the
tasks
of
the
little
spinners
which
seemed
less
than
child
play
were
deadly
in
their
monotony
their
long
indoor
hours
and
the
vibrant
clamour
amid
which
they
were
performed
her
own
vigorous
young
frame
resisted
valiantly
yet
the
saturday
the
sunday
of
rest
could
scarcely
renew
her
for
the
exorbitant
hours
of
mechanical
toil
as
she
left
the
mill
those
sultry
evenings
with
the
heat
mists
still
tremulous
over
the
valley
and
heat
lightnings
bickering
in
the
west
she
went
with
a
lagging
step
up
the
village
street
not
looking
as
had
been
her
wont
first
toward
the
far
blue
mountains
and
then
at
the
glorious
state
of
the
big
valley
the
houses
of
the
operatives
were
set
up
haphazard
and
the
village
was
denied
all
beauty
most
of
the
yards
were
unfenced
and
here
and
there
a
row
of
shanties
would
be
crowded
so
close
together
that
speech
in
one
could
be
heard
in
the
other
and
then
if
any
ketchin
disease
does
break
out
like
the
dipthery
did
last
year
mavity
bence
said
one
evening
as
she
walked
home
with
johnnie
hit
sartin
shore
to
go
through
like
it
would
go
through
a
family
johnnie
looked
curiously
at
the
dirty
yards
with
their
debris
of
lard
buckets
and
tin
cans
space
air
earth
and
sky
was
cheap
and
plentiful
in
the
mountains
it
seemed
strange
to
be
sparing
of
it
down
here
where
people
were
so
rich
what
makes
build
so
close
aunt
mavity
she
asked
hit
the
company
returned
bence
lifelessly
they
do
want
to
spend
any
more
than
they
have
to
for
land
besides
they
want
everything
to
be
nigh
to
the
mill
lord
hit
do
make
no
differ
only
when
a
fire
starts
in
a
row
of
hit
cleans
up
the
company
property
same
as
it
does
the
plunder
of
the
folks
that
lives
in
you
just
got
to
be
thankful
if
there
do
chance
to
be
one
or
more
baby
children
locked
up
in
the
houses
and
burned
along
with
the
other
stuff
i
knowed
that
to
happen
more
than
oncet
johnnie
face
whitened
miss
lydia
says
she
going
to
persuade
her
to
furnish
a
kindergarten
and
a
day
nursery
for
the
hardwick
mill
she
offered
hastily
they
have
one
at
some
other
mill
down
in
georgia
and
she
says
it
fine
the
way
they
take
care
of
the
children
while
the
mothers
are
at
work
in
the
factory
put
in
mandy
meacham
slowly
speaking
over
the
shoulders
of
the
two
but
i
a
heap
ruther
take
care
of
my
own
child
ef
i
had
one
ef
the
mills
can
afford
to
pay
for
it
the
one
way
they
can
afford
to
pay
for
it
way
miss
liddy
schemes
is
all
for
the
showin
off
of
the
swells
and
the
rich
folks
i
reckon
that
with
her
hit
end
in
talk
anyhow
hit
always
does
aunt
mavity
pursued
johnnie
timidly
do
you
reckon
the
unhealthy
down
here
in
cottonville
looks
like
all
the
children
in
the
mill
have
the
same
white
puny
look
i
thought
maybe
the
water
agree
with
them
mavity
bence
laughed
out
mirthlessly
the
water
she
echoed
in
a
tone
of
amused
contempt
johnnie
you
mighty
smart
about
some
things
cai
you
see
that
a
cotton
mill
is
bound
to
either
kill
or
cripple
a
child
them
that
do
die
sort
o
drags
along
and
grows
up
to
be
undersized
sickly
somebodies
hit
true
the
hardwick
mill
wo
run
night
turn
hit
true
they
show
mo
good
will
about
older
children
but
if
you
can
make
a
cotton
mill
healthy
for
you
can
do
more
than
god
she
wiped
her
eyes
furtively
lou
was
well
growed
before
ever
she
went
in
the
mill
i
know
in
reason
hit
never
hurt
her
i
mean
these
here
mammies
that
i
see
puttin
little
tricks
to
work
that
ort
to
be
runnin
out
o
doors
gettin
their
strength
and
growth
well
po
souls
i
reckon
they
do
know
no
better
god
forgive
but
if
they
got
sick
or
anything
there
always
the
hospital
johnnie
spoke
up
hopefully
as
they
passed
the
clean
white
building
standing
high
on
its
green
slope
the
hospital
echoed
mandy
with
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
yes
ef
you
want
to
be
shipped
out
of
town
in
a
box
for
the
student
doctors
to
cut
up
i
reckon
the
hospital
is
a
good
place
just
like
everything
else
the
rich
swells
does
it
for
their
profit
not
for
they
was
a
lot
of
big
talk
when
they
built
that
thar
hospital
and
every
one
of
us
was
axed
to
give
something
for
beds
and
such
we
was
told
that
if
we
got
hurt
in
the
mill
we
could
go
thar
free
and
if
we
fell
sick
they
doctor
us
for
little
or
nothin
they
can
afford
it
considerin
the
prices
they
git
for
dead
bodies
i
reckon
now
mandy
you
do
believe
any
such
as
that
remonstrated
johnnie
with
a
believe
it
i
know
it
to
be
true
mandy
stuck
to
her
point
stubbornly
thar
was
lura
dawson
her
folks
was
comin
down
to
git
the
body
and
bury
hit
and
when
they
got
here
the
hospital
folks
could
tell
whar
to
look
no
they
could
atlas
dawson
he
git
even
with
if
it
takes
him
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
his
wife
was
a
bushares
and
her
whole
tribe
is
out
agin
the
hospital
folks
and
the
mill
folks
down
here
i
reckon
you
live
too
far
up
in
the
mountains
to
hear
the
talk
but
some
of
these
swells
had
better
look
out
as
the
long
hot
days
followed
each
other
johnnie
noticed
how
mandy
failed
her
hand
was
forever
at
her
side
where
she
had
a
pain
that
she
called
a
jumpin
misery
even
broad
seasoned
mavity
bence
grew
pallid
and
gaunt
only
pap
himes
thrived
his
trouble
was
rheumatism
and
the
hot
days
were
his
best
of
evenings
he
would
sit
on
the
porch
in
his
broad
chair
the
big
yellow
cat
on
his
knees
and
smoke
his
pipe
and
if
he
cared
to
do
so
banter
unkindly
with
the
girls
on
the
steps
early
in
the
season
as
it
was
the
upstairs
rooms
were
terribly
hot
and
sometimes
the
poor
creatures
sat
or
lay
on
the
porch
till
well
past
midnight
across
the
gulch
were
songs
and
the
strumming
of
banjos
or
guitars
where
the
young
fellows
at
the
inn
waked
late
the
rich
people
on
top
of
the
hill
were
beginning
to
make
their
preparations
to
flit
to
the
seashore
or
mountains
lydia
sessions
left
for
two
weeks
promising
to
return
in
june
and
the
uplift
work
drooped
neglected
there
seems
to
be
an
understanding
that
people
do
not
need
uplifting
so
much
during
hot
weather
gray
stoddard
was
faithful
in
the
matter
of
books
he
carried
them
to
lydia
sessions
and
discussed
with
that
young
lady
a
complete
course
of
reading
for
johnnie
lydia
was
in
the
position
of
one
taking
bad
medicine
for
good
results
she
could
not
but
delight
in
any
enterprise
which
brought
stoddard
intimately
to
her
yet
the
discussion
of
johnnie
consadine
the
admiration
he
expressed
for
the
girl
character
and
work
were
as
so
much
quinine
johnnie
herself
was
dumb
and
abashed
now
in
his
presence
she
sought
vainly
for
the
poise
and
composure
which
were
her
natural
birthright
in
most
of
the
situations
of
life
yet
her
perturbation
was
not
that
of
distress
the
sight
of
him
the
sound
of
his
voice
even
if
he
were
not
saying
good
morning
to
her
would
cheer
her
heart
for
one
whole
long
hot
day
and
if
he
spoke
to
her
if
he
looked
at
her
nothing
could
touch
her
with
sadness
for
hours
afterward
she
asked
no
questions
why
this
was
so
she
met
it
with
a
sort
of
desperate
bravery
accepting
the
joy
refusing
to
see
the
sorrow
there
might
be
in
it
and
she
robbed
herself
of
necessary
sleep
to
read
stoddard
books
to
study
them
to
wring
from
them
the
last
precious
crumb
of
help
or
information
that
they
might
have
for
her
the
mountain
dweller
is
a
mental
creature
an
environment
which
builds
lean
vigorous
bodies
is
apt
to
nourish
keen
alert
minds
johnnie
crowded
into
her
few
months
of
night
reading
a
world
of
ripening
culture
ever
since
the
sunday
morning
of
the
automobile
ride
shade
buckheath
had
been
making
elaborate
pretense
of
having
forgotten
that
such
a
person
as
johnnie
consadine
existed
if
he
saw
her
approaching
he
turned
his
back
and
when
forced
to
recognize
her
barely
growled
some
unintelligible
greeting
then
one
evening
she
came
suddenly
into
the
machine
room
she
walked
slowly
down
the
long
aisle
between
pieces
of
whirring
machinery
carrying
all
eyes
with
her
it
was
an
offence
to
buckheath
to
note
how
the
other
young
fellows
turned
from
their
tasks
to
look
after
her
she
had
no
business
down
here
where
the
men
were
that
was
just
like
a
fool
girl
always
running
after
she
paused
at
his
bench
shade
she
said
bending
close
so
that
he
might
hear
the
words
i
got
leave
to
come
in
and
ask
you
to
make
me
a
thing
like
this
see
showing
a
pattern
for
a
peculiarly
slotted
strip
of
metal
buckheath
returned
to
the
surly
indifference
of
demeanour
which
was
natural
to
him
yet
he
smiled
covertly
as
he
examined
the
drawing
she
had
made
of
the
thing
she
wanted
he
divined
in
this
movement
of
johnnie
but
an
attempt
to
approach
himself
and
as
she
explained
with
some
particularity
he
paid
more
attention
to
the
girl
than
to
her
words
i
want
a
big
enough
hole
here
to
put
a
bolt
through
she
repeated
shade
do
you
understand
you
not
listening
to
one
word
i
say
buckheath
turned
and
grinned
broadly
at
her
what
the
use
of
this
foolishness
johnnie
he
inquired
clinking
the
strips
of
metal
between
his
fingers
looks
like
you
and
me
could
find
a
chance
to
visit
without
going
to
so
much
trouble
johnnie
opened
her
gray
eyes
wide
and
stared
at
him
foolishness
she
echoed
stoddard
did
call
it
foolishness
when
i
named
it
to
him
he
said
i
was
to
have
anything
i
wanted
made
and
that
one
of
the
could
attend
to
it
stoddard
what
he
got
to
do
with
it
demanded
shade
he
has
anything
but
that
i
spoke
to
him
about
it
and
he
told
me
to
try
any
plan
i
wanted
to
well
the
less
you
talk
to
the
bosses
a
girl
like
you
working
here
in
the
mill
the
better
name
you
bear
shade
told
her
twisting
the
drawing
in
his
hands
and
regarding
her
from
under
lowered
brows
do
tear
that
cautioned
johnnie
impatiently
i
have
to
speak
to
some
of
the
people
in
authority
sometimes
the
same
as
you
do
the
matter
with
you
shade
buckheath
there
nothing
the
matter
with
me
buckheath
declared
wagging
his
head
portentously
and
avoiding
her
eye
then
the
wrath
the
sense
of
personal
injury
which
had
been
simmering
in
him
ever
since
he
saw
her
sitting
beside
stoddard
in
the
young
mill
owner
car
broke
forth
when
i
see
a
girl
riding
in
an
automobile
with
one
of
these
young
bosses
he
growled
close
to
her
ear
i
know
what
to
think
and
so
does
everybody
else
it
was
out
he
had
said
it
at
last
he
stared
at
her
fiercely
the
red
dyed
her
face
and
neck
at
his
words
and
look
for
a
desperate
moment
she
took
counsel
with
herself
then
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
squarely
in
buckheath
face
oh
what
has
been
the
matter
with
you
all
this
time
is
it
she
inquired
well
i
glad
you
spoke
and
relieved
your
mind
then
she
went
on
evenly
stoddard
had
been
up
in
the
mountains
that
sunday
to
get
a
flower
that
he
wanted
like
the
one
you
stepped
on
and
broke
the
day
i
came
down
i
was
up
there
and
showed
him
where
the
things
grow
then
it
rained
and
he
brought
me
down
in
his
car
all
there
was
to
it
mighty
poor
excuse
grunted
shade
turning
his
shoulder
to
her
it
not
an
excuse
at
all
said
johnnie
you
have
no
right
to
ask
excuses
for
what
i
do
or
explanations
either
for
that
matter
told
you
the
truth
about
it
because
we
were
old
friends
and
you
named
it
to
me
but
i
sorry
now
that
i
spoke
at
all
give
me
that
drawing
and
those
patterns
back
some
of
the
other
can
make
what
i
want
you
get
mad
quick
do
you
buckheath
asked
turning
to
her
with
a
smile
on
his
face
people
always
do
no
i
not
mad
johnnie
told
him
as
she
had
told
him
long
ago
but
i
thank
you
not
to
name
stoddard
to
me
again
if
i
have
the
right
to
speak
to
anybody
i
need
to
why
it
certainly
is
your
place
to
tell
me
of
it
go
said
buckheath
surlily
i
fix
for
you
and
without
another
word
the
girl
left
him
after
johnnie
was
gone
buckheath
chewed
for
some
time
the
bitter
cud
of
chagrin
he
was
wholly
mistaken
then
in
the
object
of
her
visit
to
the
mechanical
department
yet
he
was
a
fellow
always
alert
for
that
which
might
bring
him
gain
pushing
aspiring
he
subscribed
for
and
faithfully
studied
a
mechanics
journal
which
continually
urged
upon
its
readers
the
profit
of
patenting
small
improvements
on
machinery
already
in
use
indeed
everybody
these
days
in
the
factories
is
on
the
lookout
for
patentable
improvements
why
might
not
johnnie
have
stumbled
on
to
something
worth
while
that
passmore
and
consadine
tribe
were
all
smart
fools
he
made
the
slotted
strips
she
wanted
and
delivered
them
to
her
the
next
day
with
civil
words
when
after
she
had
them
in
use
on
the
spinning
jennies
upstairs
for
a
week
she
came
down
bringing
them
for
certain
minute
alterations
his
attitude
was
one
of
friendly
helpfulness
you
say
you
use
on
the
frames
what
for
how
do
they
work
he
asked
her
examining
the
little
contrivance
lingeringly
they
working
pretty
well
she
told
him
even
the
way
they
are
a
good
deal
too
long
and
with
that
slot
not
cut
deep
enough
i
right
proud
of
myself
when
i
look
at
them
any
boy
or
girl
tending
a
frame
can
go
to
the
end
of
it
and
see
if
anything
the
matter
without
walking
plumb
down
when
you
get
them
fixed
the
way
i
want
them
i
tell
you
they
be
fine
the
next
afternoon
saw
shade
buckheath
in
the
spooling
room
watching
the
operation
of
johnnie
consadine
simple
device
for
notifying
the
if
a
thread
fouled
or
broke
let
me
take
all
down
to
the
basement
he
said
finally
when
he
had
studied
them
from
every
point
of
view
for
fifteen
minutes
they
as
well
polished
as
i
like
to
have
and
i
think
they
might
be
a
little
longer
in
the
shank
there
ought
to
be
a
ring
of
babbit
metal
around
that
slot
too
i
reckon
i
could
get
it
in
watauga
if
you
let
me
take
now
i
fix
up
for
you
soon
as
i
can
so
that
they
do
fine
johnnie
remonstrated
as
he
gathered
the
crude
little
invention
from
the
frames
but
his
proposition
wore
a
plausible
face
and
she
suffered
him
to
take
them
they
ai
but
five
here
he
said
to
her
sharply
i
know
i
made
you
six
where
the
other
one
he
looked
so
startled
he
spoke
so
anxiously
that
she
laughed
i
think
that
must
be
the
one
i
carried
home
she
said
carelessly
i
had
a
file
and
was
trying
to
fix
it
myself
one
evening
and
i
reckon
i
never
brought
it
back
johnnie
said
shade
coming
close
and
speaking
in
a
low
confidential
tone
that
was
almost
affectionate
if
i
was
you
i
would
name
this
business
to
anybody
wait
till
we
get
it
all
fixed
right
he
pursued
as
he
saw
the
rising
wonder
in
her
face
no
need
to
tell
every
feller
all
you
know
so
he
be
jest
as
smart
as
you
are
ai
that
so
and
you
git
me
that
other
strip
i
do
want
it
layin
round
for
somebody
to
get
hold
of
and
you
find
me
that
other
strip
hunt
it
up
wo
you
well
you
sure
talk
curious
johnnie
told
him
i
do
see
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
in
my
loving
to
fool
with
machinery
if
i
a
girl
but
i
get
you
the
strip
if
i
can
find
it
i
mighty
proud
of
being
a
room
boss
and
i
aim
to
make
my
room
the
best
one
in
the
mill
shade
did
you
know
that
i
get
eight
dollars
a
week
i
been
sending
money
home
to
mother
and
i
got
a
room
to
myself
down
at
pap
himes
and
mr
sessions
says
they
raise
me
again
soon
i
wanted
to
see
this
thing
working
well
look
here
broke
in
shade
swiftly
do
you
say
anything
to
the
bosses
about
this
he
shook
the
strips
in
his
hand
not
till
i
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
you
again
you
know
i
your
friend
you
johnnie
i
reckon
so
returned
truthful
johnnie
with
unflattering
moderation
you
get
me
those
things
done
as
quick
as
you
can
please
shade
after
this
the
matter
dropped
two
or
three
times
johnnie
reminded
shade
of
his
promise
to
bring
the
little
strips
back
and
always
he
had
an
excuse
ready
for
her
he
had
been
very
busy
the
metal
he
wanted
was
out
of
stock
he
would
fix
them
for
her
just
as
soon
as
he
could
with
every
interview
his
manner
toward
herself
grew
kinder
more
distinctly
that
of
a
lover
the
and
mechanics
belonging
be
it
remembered
to
a
were
out
of
all
the
mills
by
five
it
was
a
significant
point
for
any
student
of
economic
conditions
to
note
these
strapping
young
males
sitting
at
ease
upon
the
porches
of
their
homes
or
boarding
houses
when
the
sweating
fagged
women
weavers
and
childish
spinners
trooped
across
the
bridges
an
hour
after
johnnie
was
surprised
therefore
one
evening
nearly
two
weeks
later
to
find
shade
waiting
for
her
at
the
door
of
the
mill
i
you
walk
a
piece
up
the
gap
road
with
me
i
want
to
have
speech
with
you
the
young
fellow
told
her
i
ca
go
far
i
always
try
to
be
home
in
time
to
help
aunt
mavity
put
supper
on
the
table
or
anyway
to
wash
up
the
dishes
for
her
the
girl
replied
to
him
all
right
agreed
buckheath
briefly
wait
here
a
minute
and
let
me
get
some
things
i
want
to
take
along
he
stopped
at
a
little
shed
back
of
the
offices
sometimes
called
the
garage
because
stoddard
car
stood
in
it
johnnie
dropped
down
on
a
box
at
the
door
and
the
young
fellow
went
inside
and
began
searching
the
pockets
of
a
coat
hanging
on
a
peg
he
spoke
over
his
shoulder
to
her
what
the
matter
with
you
here
lately
since
you
got
your
raise
like
you
wo
look
at
a
body
have
i
seemed
friendly
johnnie
returned
with
a
deprecating
smile
i
reckon
i
just
tired
seems
like
i
tired
every
minute
of
the
day
and
i
could
tell
you
why
i
sure
do
have
anything
hard
to
do
i
think
sometimes
i
need
the
good
hard
work
i
used
to
have
back
in
the
mountains
to
get
rested
on
she
laughed
up
at
him
and
buckheath
emotional
nature
answered
with
a
dull
anger
which
was
his
only
reply
to
her
attraction
i
was
going
to
invite
you
to
go
to
a
dance
in
at
watauga
saturday
night
he
said
sullenly
but
i
reckon
if
you
tired
all
the
time
you
do
want
to
go
he
had
hoped
and
expected
that
she
would
say
she
was
not
too
tired
to
go
anywhere
that
he
wished
her
to
his
disappointment
was
disproportionate
when
she
sighingly
agreed
yes
i
reckon
i
had
better
go
to
any
dances
i
would
for
the
world
break
down
at
my
work
when
i
just
begun
to
earn
so
much
and
am
sending
money
home
to
mother
inside
the
offices
lydia
sessions
stood
near
her
brother
desk
she
had
gone
down
as
she
sometimes
did
to
take
him
home
in
the
carriage
oh
here
you
are
miss
sessions
said
gray
stoddard
coming
in
brought
those
books
for
johnnie
there
are
a
lot
of
them
here
for
her
to
make
selection
from
as
you
are
driving
perhaps
you
would
mind
letting
me
set
them
in
the
carriage
then
i
wo
go
up
past
your
house
miss
sessions
glanced
uneasily
at
the
volumes
he
carried
do
you
think
it
wise
to
give
an
ignorant
untrained
girl
like
that
the
choice
of
her
own
reading
she
said
at
length
stoddard
laughed
it
as
far
as
my
wisdom
goes
he
replied
promptly
i
would
as
soon
think
of
getting
up
a
form
of
prayer
for
a
fellow
creature
as
laying
out
a
course
of
reading
for
him
well
then
suggested
miss
sessions
why
not
let
her
take
up
a
chatauqua
course
i
sure
many
of
them
are
excellent
she
would
be
properly
guided
and
and
encroach
less
on
your
time
my
time
echoed
stoddard
never
mind
that
feature
i
immensely
interested
it
fascinating
to
watch
the
development
of
so
fine
a
mind
which
has
lain
almost
entirely
fallow
to
the
culture
of
schools
i
quite
enjoy
looking
out
a
bunch
of
books
for
her
and
watching
to
see
which
one
will
most
appeal
to
her
her
instinct
has
proved
wholly
trustworthy
so
far
indeed
if
it
did
seem
exaggerated
i
should
say
her
taste
was
faultless
miss
sessions
flushed
and
set
her
lips
together
faultless
she
repeated
with
an
attempt
at
a
smile
i
fancy
johnnie
finds
out
what
you
admire
most
and
makes
favourites
of
your
favourites
stoddard
looked
a
bit
blank
for
an
instant
then
well
perhaps
she
does
he
allowed
hesitatingly
his
usual
tolerant
smile
held
a
hint
of
indulgent
tenderness
and
there
was
a
vibration
in
his
voice
which
struck
to
lydia
sessions
heart
like
a
knife
no
you
are
mistaken
he
added
after
a
moment
reflection
you
realize
how
little
i
talked
to
the
child
about
books
or
anything
else
for
that
matter
it
does
chance
that
her
taste
is
mine
in
very
many
cases
but
you
underrate
our
protégé
when
you
speak
of
her
as
ignorant
and
uncultured
she
knows
a
good
deal
more
about
some
things
than
either
of
us
it
is
her
fund
of
nature
lore
that
makes
thoreau
and
white
of
selborne
appeal
to
her
now
i
love
them
because
i
know
so
little
about
what
they
write
of
lydia
sessions
instantly
fastened
upon
the
one
point
she
protested
almost
anxiously
but
surely
you
would
not
call
her
cultured
a
factory
girl
who
has
lived
in
a
hut
in
the
mountains
all
her
life
she
is
trying
hard
i
admit
but
her
speech
is
well
it
certainly
is
rather
uncivilized
stoddard
looked
as
though
he
might
debate
that
matter
a
bit
then
he
questioned
instead
did
you
ever
get
a
letter
from
her
she
does
carry
her
quaint
little
archaisms
of
pronunciation
and
wording
into
her
writing
her
letters
are
delicious
miss
sessions
turned
hastily
to
the
window
and
looked
out
apparently
to
observe
whether
her
brother
was
ready
to
leave
or
not
johnnie
consadine
letters
her
letters
what
when
of
course
she
could
not
baldly
question
him
in
such
a
matter
and
the
simple
explanation
of
a
little
note
of
thanks
with
a
returned
book
or
the
leaf
which
reported
impressions
from
its
reading
tucked
in
between
the
pages
occurred
to
her
perturbed
mind
you
quite
astonish
me
she
said
finally
well
that
good
hearing
stoddard
with
sudden
decision
do
you
believe
that
it
would
be
well
worth
while
in
view
of
all
this
to
raise
the
money
and
send
john
consadine
away
to
a
good
school
there
are
several
fine
ones
in
new
england
where
she
might
partially
work
her
way
and
really
from
what
you
say
it
seems
to
me
she
worthy
of
such
a
chance
stoddard
glanced
at
her
in
surprise
why
miss
sessions
does
this
look
like
going
squarely
back
on
your
most
cherished
theories
if
it
only
to
bestow
a
little
money
and
send
her
away
to
some
school
what
becomes
of
your
argument
that
people
who
have
had
advantages
should
give
of
themselves
and
their
comradeship
to
those
they
wish
to
help
there
was
a
boyish
eagerness
in
his
manner
his
changeful
eyes
were
alight
he
came
close
and
laid
a
hand
on
her
arm
quite
an
unusual
demonstration
with
gray
stoddard
you
must
discourage
me
he
said
winningly
i
such
a
hopeful
disciple
i
never
enjoyed
anything
more
in
my
life
than
this
enterprise
you
and
i
have
undertaken
together
providing
the
right
food
for
so
bright
and
so
responsive
a
mind
miss
lydia
looked
at
him
in
a
sort
of
despair
yes
oh
yes
i
quite
understand
that
she
agreed
almost
mechanically
i
do
mean
to
go
back
on
my
principles
but
what
john
needs
is
a
good
sound
education
from
the
beginning
do
you
think
so
no
said
stoddard
promptly
indeed
i
do
not
development
must
come
from
within
to
give
it
a
chance
to
lend
it
stimulus
that
all
a
friend
can
do
a
education
plastered
on
the
outside
cultivates
nobody
moreover
johnnie
is
in
no
crying
need
of
mere
schooling
you
do
seem
to
know
how
well
provided
she
has
been
in
that
respect
but
the
thing
that
settles
the
matter
is
that
she
would
not
accept
any
such
charitable
arrangement
unless
you
tired
of
our
present
method
i
vote
to
continue
it
lydia
sessions
had
been
for
some
moments
watching
johnnie
consadine
who
sat
on
her
box
at
the
door
of
the
little
garage
she
had
refrained
from
mentioning
this
fact
to
her
companion
but
now
shade
buckheath
stepped
out
to
join
johnnie
and
instantly
lydia
turned
and
motioned
stoddard
to
her
look
there
she
whispered
do
they
make
a
perfect
couple
you
and
i
may
do
what
we
choose
about
cultivating
the
girl
mind
she
marry
a
man
of
her
own
class
and
there
it
will
end
why
should
you
say
that
asked
stoddard
abruptly
those
two
do
not
belong
to
the
same
class
they
oh
stoddard
they
grew
up
side
by
side
they
went
to
school
together
and
i
imagine
were
sweethearts
long
before
they
came
to
cottonville
do
you
think
that
makes
them
of
the
same
class
asked
stoddard
impatiently
i
should
say
the
presumption
was
still
greater
the
other
way
i
was
not
alluding
to
social
classes
you
so
odd
murmured
lydia
sessions
these
mountaineers
are
all
alike
the
village
road
was
a
smother
of
white
dust
the
weeds
beside
it
drooped
powdered
heads
evil
odours
reeked
through
the
little
place
but
when
shade
and
johnnie
had
passed
its
confines
the
air
from
the
mountains
greeted
them
sweetly
the
dusty
white
road
gave
place
to
springy
mixed
with
tiny
sharp
stones
a
young
moon
rode
low
in
the
west
the
of
cowbells
sounded
from
homing
animals
up
in
the
dusky
gap
were
beginning
to
call
i
glad
i
came
said
johnnie
pushing
the
hair
off
her
hot
forehead
she
was
speaking
to
herself
aware
that
buckheath
paid
little
attention
but
walked
in
silence
a
step
ahead
twisting
a
little
branch
of
sassafras
in
his
fingers
the
spicy
odour
of
the
bark
was
afterward
associated
in
johnnie
mind
with
what
he
had
then
to
say
johnnie
he
began
facing
around
and
barring
her
way
when
they
were
finally
alone
together
between
the
trees
do
you
remember
the
last
time
you
and
me
was
on
this
piece
of
road
here
do
you
he
had
intended
to
remind
her
of
the
evening
she
came
to
cottonville
but
instead
recollection
built
for
her
once
more
the
picture
of
that
slope
bathed
in
sabbath
sunshine
there
was
the
fork
where
the
hardwick
carriage
had
turned
off
to
this
side
went
shade
and
his
fellows
with
mandy
and
the
girls
following
and
down
the
middle
of
the
road
she
herself
came
seated
in
the
car
beside
stoddard
for
a
moment
memory
choked
and
blinded
johnnie
she
could
neither
see
the
path
before
them
nor
find
the
voice
to
answer
her
questioner
the
bleak
pathos
of
her
situation
came
home
to
her
and
tears
of
rare
filled
her
eyes
why
was
it
a
disgrace
that
stoddard
should
treat
her
kindly
why
must
she
be
ashamed
of
her
feeling
for
him
shade
voice
broke
in
harshly
do
you
remember
you
ai
forgot
have
you
ever
since
that
time
intended
to
speak
to
you
to
tell
you
well
you
need
do
it
she
interrupted
him
passionately
i
wo
hear
a
word
against
stoddard
if
that
what
you
aiming
at
buckheath
fell
back
a
pace
and
stared
with
angry
eyes
stoddard
gray
stoddard
he
repeated
what
a
swell
like
that
got
to
do
with
you
and
me
johnnie
consadine
you
want
to
let
gray
stoddard
and
his
kind
alone
yes
and
make
them
let
you
alone
if
you
and
me
are
going
to
marry
it
was
johnnie
turn
to
stare
if
we
going
to
marry
she
echoed
blankly
going
to
marry
the
girl
had
had
her
lovers
despite
hard
work
and
the
stigma
of
belonging
to
the
borrowing
passmore
family
johnnie
had
commanded
the
homage
of
more
than
one
heart
she
was
not
without
a
healthy
young
woman
relish
for
this
sort
of
admiration
but
shade
buckheath
proposal
came
with
so
little
grace
in
such
almost
sinister
form
that
she
scarcely
recognized
it
yes
if
we
going
to
wed
reiterated
buckheath
sullenly
willin
to
have
you
johnnie
tense
almost
tragic
manner
relaxed
she
laughed
suddenly
i
did
know
you
was
joking
shade
she
said
i
took
you
to
be
in
earnest
you
have
to
excuse
me
i
am
in
earnest
buckheath
told
her
almost
fiercely
i
reckon
i
a
fool
but
i
want
you
any
day
he
spoke
with
a
curious
reluctance
any
day
you
say
the
word
i
take
you
his
eyes
like
his
voice
were
resentful
yet
eager
he
took
off
his
hat
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
looking
away
from
her
now
toward
the
road
by
which
they
had
climbed
johnnie
regarded
him
through
her
thick
eyelashes
the
smile
still
lingering
bright
in
her
eyes
after
all
it
was
only
a
rather
unusual
kind
of
sweethearting
and
not
a
case
of
it
to
touch
her
feelings
i
mighty
sorry
she
said
soberly
but
i
ai
aimin
to
wed
any
man
fixed
like
i
am
mother
and
the
children
have
to
be
looked
after
and
i
ca
ask
a
man
to
do
for
so
i
have
it
to
do
myself
of
course
i
ca
take
your
mother
and
the
children
buckheath
objected
querulously
as
though
she
had
asked
him
to
do
so
but
you
i
take
and
you
do
well
to
think
it
over
you
wo
get
such
a
chance
soon
again
and
i
apt
to
change
my
mind
if
you
put
on
airs
with
me
this
way
johnnie
shook
her
head
i
know
it
a
fine
chance
shade
she
said
in
the
kindest
tone
but
i
hoping
you
will
change
your
mind
and
that
soon
for
it
just
like
i
tell
you
she
turned
with
evident
intention
of
going
back
and
terminating
their
interview
buckheath
stepped
beside
her
in
helpless
fury
he
knew
she
would
have
other
opportunities
and
better
he
was
aware
how
futile
was
this
threat
of
withdrawing
his
proposition
hot
tired
angry
the
dust
of
the
way
prickling
on
his
face
and
neck
he
was
persistently
conscious
of
a
letter
in
the
pocket
of
his
striped
shirt
over
his
heavily
beating
heart
warm
and
moist
like
the
shirt
itself
with
the
sweat
of
his
body
good
lord
that
letter
which
had
come
from
washington
this
morning
informing
him
that
the
device
this
girl
had
invented
was
patentable
filled
her
hands
with
gold
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
have
control
of
her
and
at
once
he
put
from
him
the
knowledge
of
how
her
charm
wrought
upon
him
bound
him
the
faster
every
time
he
spoke
to
her
cold
calculating
sluggishly
selfish
he
had
not
reckoned
with
her
radiant
personality
nor
had
the
instinct
to
know
that
approached
closely
it
must
inevitably
light
in
him
unwelcome
and
inextinguishable
fires
johnnie
he
said
finally
you
ai
saying
no
to
me
are
you
you
take
time
to
think
it
over
but
not
so
very
long
i
name
it
to
you

buckheath
regarded

sullen
sombre
eyes

chapter
x
the
sandals
of
joy
come
in
here
johnnie
mavity
bence
called
one
day
as
johnnie
was
passing
a
strange
little
cluttered
cubbyhole
under
the
garret
stairs
and
out
over
the
roof
of
the
kitchen
it
was
a
hybrid
apartment
between
a
large
closet
and
a
small
room
one
window
gave
scant
light
and
ventilation
all
the
broken
or
disused
plunder
about
the
house
was
pitched
into
it
and
in
the
middle
sat
a
tumbled
bed
it
was
the
woman
sleeping
place
and
her
dead
daughter
had
shared
it
with
her
during
her
lifetime
johnnie
stopped
at
the
door
with
a
hand
on
each
side
of
its
frame
reddin
up
things
aunt
mavity
she
asked
adding
if
i
had
time
come
in
and
help
you
i
was
just
puttin
away
what
i
got
left
that
belonged
to
lou
said
the
woman
sitting
suddenly
down
on
the
bed
and
gazing
up
into
the
bright
face
above
her
with
a
sort
of
appeal
johnnie
noticed
then
that
bence
had
a
pair
of
cheap
slippers
in
her
lap
it
came
back
vividly
to
the
girl
how
the
newspapers
had
said
that
louvania
bence
had
taken
off
her
slippers
and
left
them
on
the
bridge
that
she
might
climb
the
netting
more
easily
to
throw
herself
into
the
water
the
mother
stared
down
at
these
she
never
had
on
but
the
once
mavity
bence
breathed
and
i
and
i
out
on
her
for
buyin
of
i
said
that
with
pap
so
old
and
all
we
had
money
to
spend
for
slippers
lord
god
she
shivered
we
had
to
find
money
for
the
undertaker
when
he
come
to
lay
her
out
she
turned
to
johnnie
feverishly
like
a
thing
that
writhes
on
the
rack
and
seeks
an
easier
position
i
had
the
best
for
her
then
i
jest
would
do
it
there
was
white
shoes
and
stockin
and
a
shroud
like
they
make
at
watauga
we
never
put
a
stitch
on
her
that
she
wore
hit
was
all
for
once
i
said
my
say
to
pap
and
made
him
take
money
out
of
the
bank
to
do
it
he
got
some
in
thar
for
to
bury
all
of
us
he
says
but
he
never
wanted
to
use
any
of
it
for
lou
johnnie
came
in
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
beside
her
hostess
she
laid
a
loving
hand
over
mavity
that
held
the
slippers
what
pretty
little
feet
she
must
have
had
she
said
softly
did
she
echoed
the
mother
with
a
tremulous
i
could
more
get
these
here
on
my
hand
but
they
was
a
loose
fit
for
her
they
as
good
as
new
johnnie
ef
you
ever
get
a
invite
to
a
dance
i
lend
to
you
hit
pleasure
me
to
think
some
gal
feet
was
dancin
in
them
thar
slippers
lou
she
never
learned
to
dance
looked
like
she
could
never
find
time
louvania
be
it
remembered
had
found
time
in
which
to
die
so
johnnie
thanked
poor
mavity
and
hurried
away
because
the
warning
whistle
was
blowing
the
very
next
wednesday
miss
sessions
gave
a
dance
to
the
members
of
her
uplift
club
these
gaieties
were
rather
singular
and
ingenious
affairs
sterilized
dances
hexter
irreverently
dubbed
them
miss
lydia
did
not
invite
the
young
men
employed
about
the
mill
not
having
as
yet
undertaken
their
uplifting
and
feeling
quite
inadequate
to
cope
with
the
relations
between
them
and
the
mill
girls
which
would
be
something
vital
and
genuine
and
as
such
quite
foreign
if
not
inimical
to
her
enterprise
she
contented
herself
with
bringing
in
a
few
young
males
of
her
own
class
who
were
expected
to
be
attentive
to
the
girls
treating
them
as
equals
just
as
miss
lydia
did
for
the
rest
the
members
were
encouraged
to
dance
with
each
other
and
find
such
joy
as
they
might
in
the
supper
and
the
fact
that
miss
sessions
paid
for
a
work
for
them
on
the
morrow
that
they
might
lie
late
in
bed
after
a
night
pleasuring
johnnie
consadine
had
begun
to
earn
money
in
such
quantities
as
seemed
to
her
economic
experience
extremely
large
she
paid
her
board
sent
a
little
home
to
her
mother
and
had
still
wherewith
to
buy
a
frock
for
the
dance
she
treated
herself
to
a
trolley
ride
in
to
watauga
to
select
this
dress
going
on
the
saturday
which
the
mills
gave
their
workers
lest
the
labour
laws
regulating
the
hours
per
week
which
women
and
children
may
be
employed
be
infringed
upon
there
was
grave
debate
in
johnnie
mind
as
to
what
she
should
buy
colours
would
fade
in
cheap
goods
anyhow
white
soiled
easily
but
then
i
could
wash
and
iron
it
myself
any
evening
i
wanted
to
wear
it
she
argued
to
mandy
meacham
who
accompanied
her
i
be
proud
to
do
it
for
you
returned
mandy
loyally
ordinarily
the
meacham
woman
was
selfish
but
having
found
an
object
upon
which
she
could
centre
her
thin
watery
affections
she
proceeded
to
be
selfish
for
johnnie
instead
of
toward
her
a
spiritual
juggle
which
some
mothers
perform
in
regard
to
their
children
the
store
reached
johnnie
showed
good
judgment
in
her
choice
there
was
a
great
sale
on
at
the
biggest
shopping
place
in
watauga
and
the
summer
wear
was
to
be
had
at
bargain
rates
not
for
her
were
the
flaring
coarse
scant
garments
whose
lack
of
seemliness
was
supposed
to
be
atoned
for
by
a
profusion
of
cheap
sleazy
trimming
after
long
and
somewhat
painful
inspection
since
most
of
the
things
she
wanted
were
hopelessly
beyond
her
johnnie
carried
home
a
fairly
fine
white
lawn
simply
tucked
and
fitting
to
perfection
but
you
got
a
shape
that
sets
off
anything
said
the
saleswoman
carelessly
dealing
out
the
compliments
she
kept
in
stock
with
her
goods
for
purchasers
you
mighty
right
she
has
rejoined
mandy
sharply
as
who
should
say
my
back
is
not
a
true
expression
of
my
desires
concerning
backs
look
at
this
other
she
has
the
spine
of
my
dreams
the
saleswoman
chewed
gum
while
they
waited
for
change
and
parcel
and
in
the
interval
she
had
time
to
inspect
johnnie
more
closely
working
in
the
cotton
mill
are
you
she
asked
as
she
sorted
up
her
stock
jingling
the
bracelets
on
her
wrists
and
patting
into
shape
her
big
frizzy
pompadour
that
awful
hard
work
ai
it
i
should
think
a
girl
like
you
would
try
for
a
place
in
a
store
i
bet
you
could
get
one
she
added
encouragingly
as
she
handed
the
parcel
across
the
counter
but
already
johnnie
knew
that
the
spurious
elegance
of
this
young
person
appearance
was
not
what
she
wished
to
emulate
the
night
of
the
dance
johnnie
adjusted
her
costume
with
the
nice
skill
and
care
which
seem
native
to
so
many
of
the
daughters
of
america
mandy
dressing
at
the
same
bureau
scraggled
the
parting
of
her
own
hair
furtively
watching
the
deft
arranging
of
johnnie
let
me
do
it
for
you
and
part
it
straight
johnnie
remonstrated
aw
hit
never
be
seen
on
a
gallopin
hoss
returned
mandy
carelessly
everybody
be
so
tuck
up
you
that
they
have
time
to
notice
is
my
hair
parted
straight
nohow
but
you
not
a
galloping
horse
objected
johnnie
laughing
and
clutching
the
comb
away
from
her
you
got
mighty
pretty
hair
mandy
if
you
give
it
a
chance
why
it
curly
let
me
do
it
up
right
for
you
once
so
the
thin
graying
ringlets
were
loosened
around
the
meagre
forehead
and
indeed
mandy
appearance
was
considerably
ameliorated
there
is
that
nice
inquired
johnnie
turning
her
companion
around
to
the
glass
and
forcing
her
to
gaze
in
it
a
thing
mandy
always
instinctively
avoided
i
reckon
i
looked
worse
agreed
the
tall
woman
unenthusiastically
but
miss
lyddy
ai
carin
to
have
ye
fix
up
much
i
get
sort
of
feisty
and
want
to
her
by
makin
you
look
pretty
you
would
wear
that
o
mine
an
them
rings
an
beads
i
borried
from
lizzie
for
ye
you
might
just
as
well
and
then
nobody
know
you
from
one
o
the
swells
johnnie
shook
her
fair
head
decidedly
talk
of
borrowing
things
brought
a
reminiscent
flush
to
her
cheek
i
just
as
much
obliged
she
said
sweetly
i
wear
nothing
but
what
my
own
after
a
while
i
be
able
to
afford
jewellery
and
that
be
the
time
for
me
to
put
it
on
presently
came
mavity
bence
bringing
the
treasured
footwear
i
expect
they
be
a
little
tight
for
me
johnnie
remarked
somewhat
doubtfully
the
slippers
though
cheap
things
looked
so
much
smaller
than
her
heavy
shoes
but
they
went
readily
upon
the
arched
feet
of
the
mountain
girl
mandy
and
the
poor
mother
looking
on
with
deep
interest
i
lou
was
here
to
see
you
in
whispered
mavity
bence
she
would
grudge
to
you
one
minute
lord
how
pretty
you
do
look
johnnie
consadine
you
as
sightly
as
that
thar
big
wax
doll
down
at
the
company
store
i
lou
see
you
the
dance
was
being
given
in
the
big
hall
above
a
store
which
miss
lydia
hired
for
these
functions
of
her
uplift
club
the
room
was
decorated
in
a
hybrid
fashion
miss
lydia
had
sent
down
a
of
flowers
and
the
girls
being
encouraged
to
use
their
own
taste
put
up
some
flags
left
over
from
last
fourth
of
july
when
johnnie
and
mandy
meacham
strangely
assorted
pair
entered
the
long
room
festivities
were
already
in
progress
negro
fiddlers
were
reeling
off
dance
music
and
miss
lydia
was
trying
to
teach
some
of
her
club
members
the
her
younger
brother
hartley
sessions
was
gravely
piloting
a
girl
down
the
room
in
what
was
supposed
to
be
that
popular
dance
and
two
young
men
from
watauga
for
whom
he
had
vouched
stood
ready
for
miss
sessions
to
furnish
them
with
partners
when
she
should
have
encouraged
her
learners
sufficiently
to
make
the
attempt
round
the
walls
sat
the
other
girls
and
to
johnnie
memory
came
those
words
of
mandy
you
dance
if
you
can
johnnie
consadine
certainly
could
dance
many
a
time
back
in
the
mountains
she
had
walked
five
miles
after
a
hard
day
work
to
get
to
a
dance
that
some
one
of
her
mates
was
giving
tramping
home
in
the
dawn
and
doing
without
sleep
for
that
hours
the
music
seemed
somehow
to
get
into
her
muscles
so
that
she
swayed
and
moved
exactly
in
time
to
it
that
the
she
murmured
to
her
partner
i
never
tried
it
but
i
seen
dance
it
at
the
hotel
down
at
chalybeate
springs
i
can
waltz
a
little
but
i
love
an
quadrille
the
best
it
seems
more
friendly
gray
stoddard
was
talking
to
an
older
woman
who
had
come
with
her
daughter
a
woman
of
forty
perhaps
with
a
tolerant
smile
and
slow
racy
speech
a
sudden
touch
on
his
shoulder
roused
him
as
one
of
the
young
men
from
town
leaned
over
and
asked
him
excitedly
who
that
girl
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
gray
the
stunning
blonde
that
just
came
in
she
got
one
of
the
mill
girls
with
her
gray
looked
and
laughed
a
little
somehow
the
adjectives
applied
to
johnnie
did
not
please
him
both
of
them
work
in
the
mill
he
said
briefly
the
one
you
mean
is
johnnie
consadine
she
a
remarkable
girl
in
more
ways
than
merely
in
appearance
well
take
me
down
there
and
give
me
an
introduction
urged
the
youth
from
watauga
in
a
tone
of
animation
which
was
barred
from
uplift
affairs
all
right
agreed
gray
getting
to
his
feet
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
i
suppose
you
want
to
meet
the
tall
one
i
got
an
engagement
for
the
first
dance
with
miss
consadine
myself
say
ejaculated
the
other
drawing
back
that
is
fair
miss
sessions
he
appealed
to
their
hostess
as
umpire
here
gray
got
the
belle
of
the
ball
mortgaged
for
all
her
dances
and
wo
even
give
me
an
introduction
you
do
the
square
thing
by
me
wo
you
lydia
sessions
had
got
her
neophites
safely
launched
and
they
were
making
a
more
or
less
tempestuous
progress
across
the
floor
she
turned
to
the
two
young
men
a
flushed
smiling
countenance
in
the
tempered
light
and
the
extremely
favouring
costume
of
the
hour
she
looked
almost
pretty
what
is
it
she
asked
graciously
the
belle
of
the
ball
i
do
know
quite
who
that
is
oh
with
a
slight
drop
in
her
tone
and
the
temperature
of
her
expression
do
you
mean
john
consadine
really
how
well
she
is
looking
is
she
blundered
the
watauga
man
with
enthusiasm
i
call
her
a
regular
beauty
and
such
an
creature
what
is
she
trying
to
do
good
lord
she
going
to
attempt
the
with
that
eiffel
tower
she
brought
along
these
frivolous
remarks
suited
well
enough
to
the
ordinary
ballroom
did
not
please
miss
lydia
for
an
uplift
dance
the
girl
with
john
is
one
in
whom
i
take
a
very
deep
interest
she
said
with
a
touch
of
primness
john
consadine
is
young
and
exceptionally
strong
and
healthy
but
amanda
meacham
has
er
disabilities
and
afflictions
that
make
it
difficult
for
her
to
get
along
she
is
a
very
worthy
case
the
young
man
from
watauga
who
had
not
regarded
johnnie
as
a
case
at
all
but
had
considered
her
purely
as
an
exceptionally
attractive
young
woman
looked
a
trifle
bewildered
then
gray
took
his
arm
and
led
him
across
to
where
the
attempt
at
had
broken
up
in
laughing
disorder
with
that
absolutely
natural
manner
which
miss
sessions
could
never
quite
achieve
good
as
her
intentions
were
he
performed
the
introduction
and
then
said
pleasantly
baker
wants
to
ask
you
to
dance
miss
johnnie
i
carry
on
miss
amanda
teaching
or
we
sit
down
here
and
talk
if
she
rather
no
more
for
me
agreed
miss
meacham
seating
herself
decidedly
i
take
my
steps
one
at
a
time
from
this
on
i
rather
watch
johnnie
dance
anyhow
but
she
would
have
me
try
for
myself
johnnie
and
the
young
fellow
from
watauga
were
off
now
they
halted
once
or
twice
evidently
for
some
further
instructions
as
johnnie
got
the
step
and
time
and
then
moved
away
smoothly
gray
took
the
seat
beside
mandy
ai
she
a
wonder
inquired
the
big
woman
staring
fondly
after
the
fluttering
white
skirts
she
is
indeed
agreed
gray
quietly
and
then
mandy
being
thus
launched
on
the
congenial
theme
the
one
theme
upon
which
she
was
ever
loquacious
out
came
the
story
of
the
purchase
of
the
dress
the
compliments
of
the
saleswoman
the
refusal
of
the
borrowed
jewellery
johnnie
quare
she
is
that
i
never
deny
it
but
i
cai
no
more
help
likin
her
than
as
if
she
was
my
own
born
sister
that
because
she
is
fond
of
you
too
suggested
gray
thinking
of
the
girl
laborious
attempts
to
teach
poor
mandy
to
dance
do
you
reckon
she
is
asked
the
tall
woman
flushing
looks
like
johnnie
consadine
loves
every
livin
thing
on
the
top
side
of
this
earth
i
ai
never
seen
the
human
yet
that
she
ai
got
a
good
word
for
but
i
do
know
as
she
cares
stoddard
could
not
refuse
the
assurance
for
which
mandy
so
naively
angled
you
would
be
so
fond
of
her
if
she
was
fond
of
you
he
asserted
confidently
mebbe
i
would
mandy
debated
but
i
do
know
let
johnnie
put
them
two
eyes
o
hern
on
you
and
laugh
in
your
face
and
you
feel
just
like
you
follow
her
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
or
i
know
i
do
why
she
done
up
my
hair
this
evening
and
the
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
she
said
it
was
pretty
gray
turned
and
looked
into
the
flushed
tremulous
face
beside
him
with
a
sudden
tightening
in
his
throat
how
cruel
humanity
is
when
it
beholds
only
the
grotesque
in
the
mandys
of
this
world
her
hair
was
pretty
and
johnnie
had
the
eyes
of
love
to
see
it
he
stared
down
the
long
lighted
room
with
unseeing
gaze
old
andrew
macpherson
counsel
that
he
let
johnnie
consadine
alone
appealed
to
him
at
that
moment
as
cruel
good
sense
he
was
recalled
from
his
musings
by
mandy
voice
oh
look
thar
whispered
his
companion
excitedly
the
other
town
feller
has
asked
for
a
to
johnnie
too
look
at
him
his
bows
with
her
just
like
she
was
one
of
the
swells
stoddard
looked
charlie
conroy
was
relieving
baker
of
his
partner
johnnie
had
evidently
been
asked
if
she
was
tired
for
they
saw
her
laughingly
shake
her
head
and
the
new
couple
finished
what
was
left
of
the
and
seated
themselves
a
moment
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
to
wait
for
the
next
dance
to
begin
these
affairs
are
great
fun
are
they
inquired
conroy
fanning
his
late
partner
vigorously
i
love
to
dance
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
i
believe
returned
johnnie
dreamily
oh
a
dance
i
should
suppose
so
you
move
as
though
you
enjoyed
it
but
i
mean
a
performance
like
this
the
girls
are
great
fun
do
you
think
but
then
you
would
get
quite
our
point
of
view
on
that
he
glanced
again
at
her
dress
it
was
plain
and
simple
but
good
style
and
becoming
she
wore
no
jewellery
but
lots
of
girls
were
rather
affecting
that
now
especially
the
athletic
type
to
which
this
young
beauty
seemed
to
belong
surely
he
was
not
mistaken
in
guessing
her
to
be
one
of
miss
sessions
friends
of
course
he
was
not
she
had
dressed
herself
in
this
simple
fashion
for
a
dance
that
she
might
not
embarrass
the
working
people
who
attended
yes
by
george
that
was
it
and
it
was
a
long
taste
than
the
frocks
miss
sessions
and
hexter
were
wearing
johnnie
considered
his
last
remark
her
gaze
still
following
the
movements
of
the
negro
fiddler
at
the
head
of
the
room
understanding
him
to
mean
that
being
a
herself
she
could
not
get
a
detached
view
of
the
matter
and
thus
see
the
humour
of
this
attempt
to
make
society
women
of
johnnie
was
yet
not
affronted
her
clear
eyes
came
back
from
watching
uncle
zeke
manoeuvres
and
looked
frankly
into
the
eyes
of
the
man
beside
her
i
reckon
we
are
right
funny
she
assented
but
of
course
as
you
say
i
would
see
that
as
quick
as
you
would
sometimes
i
have
to
laugh
a
little
at
mandy
the
girl
i
was
dancing
with
first
this
evening
but
but
she
so
it
never
hurts
her
feelings
i
mind
being
laughed
at
myself
either
laughed
at
you
inquired
conroy
throwing
an
immense
amount
of
expression
into
his
glance
he
was
rather
a
lady
man
and
fancied
he
had
made
pretty
fair
headway
with
this
beautiful
girl
whom
he
still
supposed
to
be
of
the
circle
of
factory
owners
oh
you
mean
your
work
among
the
mill
girls
here
indeed
i
should
not
laugh
at
that
i
think
it
noble
for
those
more
fortunate
to
stretch
a
hand
to
help
their
brothers
and
sisters
that
have
so
good
a
chance
that
what
brought
me
over
here
gray
stoddard
explained
the
plan
to
me
he
does
seem
to
think
much
of
it
but
then
gray
a
socialist
at
heart
and
you
know
those
socialists
never
believe
in
organized
charity
i
tell
him
he
an
anarchist
stoddard
is
a
mighty
good
man
agreed
johnnie
with
sudden
pensiveness
they
all
been
mighty
good
to
me
ever
since
i
been
here
but
i
believe
stoddard
has
done
more
for
me
than
any
one
else
he
not
only
lends
me
books
but
he
takes
time
to
explain
things
to
me
conroy
smiled
covertly
at
the
simplicity
of
this
young
beauty
he
debated
in
his
mind
whether
indeed
it
was
not
an
affected
simplicity
of
course
gray
was
devoting
himself
to
her
and
lending
her
books
of
course
he
would
be
glad
to
assume
the
position
of
mentor
to
a
girl
who
bade
fair
to
be
such
a
pronounced
social
success
and
who
was
herself
so
charming
how
long
have
you
been
in
cottonville
miss
consadine
he
asked
do
tell
me
who
you
are
visiting
or
are
you
visiting
here
oh
no
johnnie
corrected
him
i
believe
you
have
understood
from
the
first
that
i
one
of
the
mill
girls
i
board
at
well
everybody
calls
it
pap
himes
there
was
a
moment
silence
but
conroy
managed
not
to
look
quite
as
deeply
surprised
as
he
felt
i
of
course
i
knew
it
he
began
at
length
after
having
sorted
and
discarded
half
a
dozen
explanations
there
why
there
our
dance
and
he
stood
up
in
relief
as
the
fiddlers
began
on
an
quadrille
johnnie
responded
with
alacrity
not
aware
of
having
either
risen
or
fallen
in
her
companion
estimation
she
danced
through
the
set
with
smiling
enjoyment
prompting
her
partner
who
knew
only
modern
dances
on
his
part
conroy
studied
her
covertly
trying
to
adjust
his
slow
mind
to
this
astonishing
new
state
of
things
and
to
decide
what
a
proper
attitude
might
be
toward
such
a
girl
in
the
end
he
found
himself
with
no
conclusion
they
say
they
going
to
try
a
plain
waltz
he
began
as
he
led
her
back
to
a
seat
he
hesitated
glanced
about
him
and
finally
placed
himself
uneasily
in
the
chair
beside
her
good
lord
the
situation
was
impossible
what
should
he
say
if
anybody
gray
stoddard
for
instance
chaffed
him
about
being
smitten
in
this
quarter
a
waltz
echoed
johnnie
helpfully
when
he
did
not
go
on
i
believe
i
could
dance
that
i
tried
it
once
then
you
dance
it
with
me
conroy
found
himself
saying
baldly
awkwardly
but
unable
for
the
life
of
him
to
keep
the
eagerness
out
of
his
voice
upon
the
instant
the
music
struck
up
the
two
rose
and
made
ready
for
the
dance
conroy
placing
johnnie
in
waltzing
position
and
instructing
her
solicitously
gray
stoddard
looking
on
was
amazed
at
the
naïf
simple
jealousy
that
swept
over
him
at
the
sight
she
had
danced
with
conroy
twice
already
he
ought
to
be
more
considerate
than
to
bring
the
girl
into
notice
that
way
a
chump
like
charlie
conroy
what
would
he
understand
of
such
a
nature
as
johnnie
consadine
before
he
fully
realized
his
own
intentions
he
had
paused
in
front
of
the
two
and
was
speaking
i
think
miss
johnnie
promised
me
a
dance
this
evening
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
office
in
twenty
minutes
and
i
hate
to
interrupt
you
but
i
guess
i
have
to
claim
my
own
he
became
suddenly
aware
that
conroy
was
signalling
him
across
unconscious
head
with
masonic
twistings
of
the
features
stoddard
met
these
recklessly
inconsiderate
grimacings
with
an
impassive
stare
then
looked
away
i
want
to
see
you
before
you
go
the
man
from
watauga
remarked
as
he
reluctantly
resigned
his
partner
do
you
forget
that
there
a
waltz
coming
to
me
miss
johnnie
i
going
to
have
it
if
we
make
the
band
play
special
for
us
alone
lydia
sessions
passing
on
the
arm
of
young
baker
glanced
at
johnnie
and
smiling
with
a
pair
of
tall
cavaliers
contending
for
her
favours
and
sucked
her
lips
in
to
that
thin
sharp
line
of
reprobation
johnnie
knew
so
well
dismissing
her
escort
graciously
she
hurried
to
the
little
supper
room
and
found
another
member
of
the
committee
come
here
hexter
just
look
at
that
will
you
she
called
attention
in
a
carefully
suppressed
but
fairly
tragic
tone
to
stoddard
and
johnnie
dancing
together
the
only
couple
on
the
floor
none
of
the
girls
know
how
to
waltz
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
be
suitable
if
they
did
when
i
came
past
just
now
there
were
two
of
the
men
two
talking
to
john
consadine
and
they
were
all
three
laughing
i
ca
think
how
it
is
that
girls
of
that
sort
manage
to
stir
things
up
so
and
get
all
the
men
around
them
neither
can
i
said
hexter
wickedly
if
i
did
know
how
i
believe
i
do
it
sometimes
myself
what
is
it
you
want
of
me
miss
sessions
i
must
run
back
and
see
to
supper
if
you
do
need
me
but
i
do
fretted
lydia
i
want
your
help
this
waltzing
and
and
such
things
ought
to
be
stopped
all
right
rejoined
practical
hexter
the
quickest
way
to
do
it
is
to
stop
the
music
she
had
meant
the
speech
as
a
jeer
but
lydia
sessions
welcomed
its
suggestion
hurrying
down
the
long
room
she
spoke
to
the
leader
of
their
small
orchestra
the
negro
raised
to
her
a
brown
face
full
of
astonishment
his
faltered
stopped
he
turned
to
his
two
fellows
and
gave
hasty
directions
the
waltz
measure
died
away
and
a
quadrille
was
announced
that
was
too
bad
said
stoddard
as
they
came
to
a
halt
you
were
just
getting
the
step
beautifully
the
girl
flashed
a
swift
sweet
look
up
at
him
i
do
love
to
dance
she
breathed
john
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
come
and
help
in
the
supper
room
miss
sessions
hasty
tones
broke
in
she
was
leaning
on
charlie
conroy
arm
and
when
she
departed
to
hide
johnnie
safely
away
in
the
depths
of
their
impromptu
kitchen
it
left
the
two
men
alone
together
conroy
promptly
fastened
upon
the
other
charlie
conroy
was
a
young
man
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
get
on
socially
such
figures
are
rarer
in
america
than
in
the
old
world
yet
charlie
conroy
with
his
petty
ambitions
does
not
stand
entirely
alone
he
seriously
regarded
marriage
as
a
to
a
circle
which
should
include
the
best
people
that
this
term
did
not
indicate
the
noblest
or
most
selfless
need
hardly
be
explained
it
meant
only
that
bit
of
froth
which
in
each
community
rides
high
on
the
top
of
the
cup
and
which
in
watauga
was
augmented
by
the
mill
owners
of
its
suburb
of
cottonville
conroy
had
been
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
make
an
entry
into
this
circle
by
means
of
assisting
miss
sessions
in
her
charitable
work
that
lady
herself
as
of
jerome
hardwick
and
a
descendant
of
an
excellent
new
england
family
he
regarded
with
absolute
veneration
quite
too
serious
and
profound
for
anything
so
assured
as
mere
admiration
i
tried
to
warn
you
he
began
but
you
were
bound
to
get
stung
i
beg
your
pardon
returned
stoddard
in
that
civil
colourless
interrogation
which
should
always
check
speech
even
from
the
dullest
but
conroy
was
not
sensitive
that
big
girl
you
know
he
said
leaning
close
and
speaking
in
a
confidential
tone
i
mistook
her
for
a
lady
i
was
going
my
full
length
telling
her
what
fun
the
mill
girls
were
and
trying
to
do
the
agreeable
when
i
found
out
found
out
what
inquired
stoddard
that
she
was
not
a
lady
aw
come
off
laughed
conroy
you
make
a
joke
of
everything
i
knew
that
she
was
a
weaver
in
the
mill
said
stoddard
quietly
conroy
glanced
half
wistfully
over
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
where
johnnie
had
vanished
she
a
all
right
he
said
thoughtfully
and
smile
when
that
girl
smiles
and
turns
those
eyes
on
you
by
george
if
she
was
taken
to
new
york
and
put
through
one
of
those
finishing
schools
make
a
sensation
in
the
swagger
set
stoddard
nodded
gravely
he
had
not
conroy
faith
in
the
fashionable
finishing
school
but
what
he
lacked
there
he
made
up
in
conviction
as
to
johnnie
deserts
and
abilities
there
she
comes
now
said
conroy
as
the
door
swung
open
to
admit
a
couple
of
girls
with
trays
of
coffee
cups
she
walks
mighty
well
i
wonder
where
a
girl
like
that
learned
to
carry
herself
so
finely
by
george
she
a
she
got
all
beaten
if
she
was
only
queer
about
the
accidents
of
birth
is
it
now
what
would
you
say
in
her
heredity
makes
a
common
girl
like
that
step
and
look
like
a
queen
gray
stoddard
face
relaxed
a
hint
of
his
quizzical
inscrutable
smile
was
upon
it
as
he
answered
nature
does
make
mistakes
i
do
call
johnnie
consadine
a
common
girl
it
strikes
me
that
she
is
rather
uncommon
and
outside
a
young
fellow
in
the
sunday
suit
of
a
workingman
was
walking
up
and
down
staring
at
the
lighted
windows
catching
a
glimpse
now
and
again
of
one
girl
or
another
and
cursing
under
his
breath
when
he
saw
johnnie
consadine
would
go
with
me
to
the
dance
at
watauga
oh
no
but
she
ai
too
tired
to
dance
with
the
swells
he
muttered
to
the
darkness
and
i
ca
get
a
word
nor
a
look
out
of
her
lord
i
do
know
what
some
women
think
chapter
xi
the
new
boarder
pap
himes
was
sitting
on
the
front
gallery
dozing
in
the
westering
sunshine
on
his
lap
the
big
yellow
cat
purred
and
blinked
with
a
grotesque
resemblance
in
colouring
and
expression
to
his
master
it
was
sunday
afternoon
when
the
toilers
were
all
out
of
the
mills
and
most
of
them
lying
on
their
beds
or
gone
in
to
watauga
the
village
seemed
curiously
silent
and
deserted
through
the
lazy
smoke
from
his
cob
pipe
pap
noticed
shade
buckheath
emerge
from
the
store
and
start
up
the
street
he
paid
no
more
attention
till
the
young
man
voice
at
the
porch
edge
roused
him
from
his
evenin
pap
said
the
newcomer
good
evenin
yourself
returned
himes
with
unusual
cordiality
he
liked
men
particularly
young
vigorous
masterful
men
come
in
buck
an
set
a
spell
rest
your
hat
rest
your
hat
it
was
always
pap
custom
to
call
shade
by
the
first
syllable
of
his
second
name
buck
is
a
common
for
boys
in
the
mountains
and
it
could
not
be
guessed
whether
the
old
man
used
it
as
a
diminutive
of
the
surname
or
whether
he
meant
merely
to
nickname
this
favourite
of
his
shade
threw
himself
on
the
upper
step
of
the
porch
and
searched
in
his
pockets
for
tobacco
room
for
another
boarder
he
asked
laconically
the
old
man
nodded
i
reckon
there
always
room
ef
it
asked
for
he
returned
the
one
way
i
got
to
make
me
a
livin
with
louvany
dyin
off
and
mavity
puny
like
she
is
i
have
obliged
to
keep
the
house
full
or
we
see
the
bottom
of
the
meal
sack
all
right
agreed
buckheath
rising
and
treating
the
matter
as
terminated
i
move
my
things
in
hold
on
thar
hold
on
young
feller
objected
pap
as
shade
turned
away
it
was
against
all
reasonable
mountain
precedent
to
trade
so
quickly
but
indeed
shade
had
merely
done
so
with
a
view
to
forcing
through
what
he
well
knew
to
be
a
doubtful
proposition
i
on
he
observed
gruffly
at
last
as
the
other
continued
to
blink
at
him
with
red
eyes
and
say
nothing
what
the
matter
with
what
i
said
you
told
me
you
had
room
for
another
boarder
and
i
named
it
that
i
was
comin
to
board
at
your
house
have
you
got
any
objections
well
yes
i
have
himes
opened
up
ponderously
you
set
yourself
down
on
that
thar
step
and
we
have
this
here
thing
out
my
is
for
gals
i
fixed
it
so
when
i
come
here
there
ai
scarcely
a
rowdy
feller
in
cottonville
that
hai
at
one
time
or
another
had
the
notion
he
board
with
pap
himes
but
i
always
kep
a
respectable
house
and
i
always
aim
to
i
am
a
old
man
and
i
bear
a
good
name
and
i
the
only
man
in
this
house
and
i
aim
to
stay
so
now
sir
my
flatform
and
you
may
take
it
or
leave
it
buckheath
glanced
angrily
and
contemptuously
into
the
stupid
fatuous
countenance
above
him
he
appeared
to
curb
with
some
difficulty
the
disposition
to
retort
in
kind
instead
he
returned
sarcastically
the
fellers
around
town
say
you
wo
keep
anything
but
gals
because
nothin
but
gals
would
put
up
with
your
hectorin
and
crowdin
ten
in
a
room
that
was
intended
for
four
that
what
folks
say
but
got
a
reason
to
want
to
board
with
you
pap
and
i
pay
regular
prices
and
take
what
you
give
me
himes
looked
a
little
astonished
then
an
expression
of
distrust
stole
over
his
broad
flat
face
what
bringin
you
here
he
asked
bluntly
johnnie
consadine
returned
shade
without
evasion
or
preamble
before
i
left
the
mountains
johnnie
an
me
was
aimin
to
now
she
got
down
here
and
doin
better
than
ever
she
hoped
to
and
i
cai
get
within
of
her
ye
cai
inquired
pap
scornfully
why
anybody
could
marry
that
gal
that
wanted
to
but
lord
anybody
can
marry
gal
if
he
got
the
sense
he
was
born
with
all
right
repeated
shade
grimly
i
come
to
you
to
know
could
i
get
board
not
to
ask
advice
i
aim
to
marry
johnnie
consadine
and
i
know
my
own
business
air
you
goin
to
board
me
the
old
man
turned
this
speech
in
his
mind
for
some
time
curious
he
muttered
to
himself
how
these
here
young
fellers
will
get
petted
on
some
special
gal
and
break
their
necks
to
have
her
shut
up
will
you
ejaculated
buckheath
so
suddenly
and
fiercely
that
the
old
man
fairly
jumped
rousing
the
yellow
cat
to
remonstrative
squirmings
i
tell
you
i
know
my
business
and
i
ask
no
advice
of
you
will
you
board
me
i
cai
do
it
buck
returned
himes
definitely
i
ai
got
such
a
room
to
give
you
by
yourself
as
you
be
willin
to
take
up
with
and
nobody
comes
into
my
room
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
for
you
meal
you
ef
that
will
help
your
case
any
i
meal
you
for
two
dollars
a
week
and
throw
in
a
good
word
with
johnnie
buckheath
received
the
conclusion
of
this
speech
with
a
grin
i
reckon
your
good
word
have
a
lot
to
do
with
johnnie
consadine
he
said
ironically
as
he
picked
up
his
hat
from
the
floor
nodded
pap
she
sets
a
heap
of
store
by
what
i
say
all
of
does
but
johnnie
in
particular
i
do
know
but
what
you
about
right
ai
no
sense
in
bein
all
tore
up
concernin
any
gal
or
woman
but
i
believe
if
i
was
pickin
out
a
good
worker
that
would
earn
her
way
i
as
soon
pick
out
johnnie
consadine
as
any
of
and
having
thus
paid
his
ultimate
compliment
to
johnnie
himes
relapsed
into
intermittent
slumber
as
shade
moved
away
down
the
squalid
dusty
street
under
the
fierce
july
sun
johnnie
greeted
the
new
boarder
with
a
reserve
which
was
in
marked
contrast
to
the
reception
he
got
from
the
other
girls
shade
buckheath
was
a
handsome
compelling
fellow
and
a
good
match
this
adamless
eden
regarded
him
as
a
rival
in
glory
even
to
pap
himself
when
supper
was
over
on
the
first
night
of
his
arrival
shade
walked
out
on
the
porch
and
seated
himself
on
the
steps
the
girls
disposed
themselves
at
a
little
distance
your
young
female
is
ever
obviously
shy
almost
to
prudery
whar
johnnie
consadine
asked
the
newcomer
lazily
disposing
himself
with
his
back
against
a
post
and
his
long
legs
stretched
across
the
upper
step
settin
in
thar
readin
a
book
replied
beulah
catlett
curtly
beulah
was
but
fourteen
and
she
belonged
to
the
newer
dispensation
which
speaks
up
more
boldly
to
the
masculine
half
of
creation
johnnie
johnnie
consadine
she
called
through
the
casement
here
buckheath
wishful
of
your
company
better
come
out
i
will
after
a
while
returned
johnnie
absently
i
got
to
help
aunt
mavity
some
and
then
i
be
there
hit
a
sight
the
books
that
gal
does
read
complained
beulah
looks
like
a
body
might
get
enough
stayin
in
the
house
by
workin
in
a
cotton
mill
without
humpin
theirselves
up
over
a
book
all
evenin
stoddard
lends
to
her
announced
mandy
importantly
he
used
to
give
to
miss
lyddy
sessions
and
she
give
to
johnnie
but
now
when
miss
lyddy
away
he
bring
one
down
to
the
mill
about
every
so
often
and
him
an
johnnie
stand
and
gas
and
talk
over
what
in
i
cai
understand
one
word
they
say
i
tell
you
johnnie
consadine
got
sense
her
pride
in
johnnie
made
her
miss
the
look
of
rage
that
settled
on
buckheath
face
at
her
announcement
the
young
fellow
was
glad
when
pap
himes
began
to
speak
growlingly
yes
an
if
she
was
my
gal
i
talk
to
her
with
a
hickory
about
that
there
business
a
gal
that
ai
too
old
to
carry
on
too
old
to
take
a
whippin
for
it
huh
for
her
own
self
mandy
would
have
been
thoroughly
scared
by
this
attack
in
johnnie
defence
she
rustled
her
feathers
like
an
old
hen
whose
one
chick
has
been
menaced
johnnie
consadine
is
the
gal
i
ever
seen
she
announced
shrilly
she
ai
never
said
nor
done
the
least
thing
that
she
had
ort
stoddard
he
just
sees
how
awful
smart
she
is
and
he
loves
to
lend
her
books
and
talk
with
her
about
afterward
for
my
part
i
ai
never
seen
look
nor
motion
about
gray
stoddard
that
was
such
as
a
gentleman
ort
to
be
i
know
he
never
said
nothin
he
ort
not
to
the
suggestion
of
stoddard
making
advances
of
unseemly
warmth
to
mandy
meacham
produced
a
subdued
snicker
even
pap
smiled
and
mandy
herself
who
had
been
looking
a
bit
terrified
after
her
bold
speaking
was
reassured
buckheath
had
been
a
week
at
the
himes
finding
it
not
unpleasant
to
show
johnnie
consadine
how
many
of
the
girls
regarded
him
with
favour
whether
she
did
or
not
when
he
came
to
supper
one
evening
with
a
gleam
in
his
eye
that
spoke
evil
for
some
one
after
the
meal
was
over
he
followed
pap
out
on
the
porch
and
sat
down
beside
the
old
man
the
girls
being
bunched
expectantly
on
the
step
for
he
was
apt
to
delay
for
a
bit
of
chat
with
one
or
another
of
them
before
leaving
you
infernal
old
rascal
i
caught
up
with
you
he
whispered
leaning
close
to
his
host
himes
clutched
the
pipe
in
his
teeth
till
it
clicked
and
stared
in
helpless
resentment
at
his
mealer
what
the
matter
with
you
he
demanded
speak
lower
so
the
gals
wo
hear
you
or
you
wish
you
had
counselled
shade
i
sent
that
there
thing
on
to
washington
to
get
a
patent
on
it
and
now
i
find
that
they
was
a
model
of
the
same
there
in
the
name
of
gideon
himes
what
do
you
make
of
that
pap
stared
at
the
thin
strips
of
metal
lying
in
shade
hard
brown
palm
the
little
liar
he
breathed
she
told
me
she
got
it
up
herself
he
glared
at
the
bits
of
steel
with
protruding
eyes
and
breathed
hard
well
she
did
shade
countered
swiftly
taking
advantage
of
the
turn
things
were
showing
i
made
six
of
and
when
i
told
her
to
bring
back
and
i
give
her
some
that
would
wear
better
she
only
brought
me
five
she
said
she
lost
one
here
at
home
she
believed
i
might
have
knowed
then
that
you
get
your
claws
on
it
ef
i
mighty
peart
old
gideon
was
not
listening
he
had
fallen
into
a
brown
study
turning
the
piece
of
metal
in
his
skilful
wonted
knotty
fingers
with
their
spade
tips
put
it
out
of
sight
quick
here
she
comes
whispered
shade
and
the
old
man
looked
up
to
see
johnnie
consadine
in
the
doorway
a
grin
of
triumph
grew
slowly
upon
his
face
as
he
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
she
did
get
it
up
he
returned
in
buckheath
face
you
liar
to
steal
it
from
her
you
filed
out
the
pieces
like
she
told
you
to
and
when
you
found
it
would
work
you
tried
to
get
a
patent
on
it
for
yes
sir
i
onto
shade
looked
over
his
shoulder
the
girls
had
forsaken
the
steps
despairing
of
his
coming
they
were
strolling
after
johnnie
on
the
sidewalk
it
you
and
me
for
it
pap
he
said
hardily
what
was
to
do
was
you
gettin
the
patent
for
johnnie
shall
i
call
her
up
here
and
ask
her
no
no
exclaimed
the
old
man
hastily
they
ai
no
use
of
sich
things
in
a
fool
gal
hands
she
never
heard
of
a
patent
know
one
from
a
hole
in
the
ground
hit
like
you
say
buck
you
and
me
for
it
the
two
men
rose
and
stood
a
moment
shade
smiling
a
bit
to
think
what
he
would
do
with
pap
himes
and
his
claim
if
he
could
only
once
get
johnnie
to
say
yes
to
his
suit
the
thick
wits
of
the
elder
man
apparently
realized
this
feature
of
the
matter
not
at
all
why
that
thar
girl
is
crazy
to
get
married
he
argued
half
angrily
you
know
in
reason
she
is
they
all
are
the
fust
night
when
you
brung
her
here
i
named
it
to
her
that
she
was
pretty
well
along
in
years
and
she
better
be
spry
about
gettin
her
hooks
on
a
man
or
she
was
left
she
said
she
do
the
best
she
could
i
never
heered
a
gal
speak
up
pearter
most
of
would
be
to
name
it
out
so
free
why
if
it
was
me
i
walk
her
down
to
a
justice
office
an
wed
her
so
quick
her
head
swim
who
that
talking
about
getting
married
called
johnnie
voice
from
the
street
and
johnnie
herself
ran
up
the
steps
hit
was
me
harangued
pap
himes
doggedly
i
was
tellin
shade
how
bad
you
wanted
to
git
off
and
that
i
you
be
a
good
bargain
for
him
he
looked
hopefully
from
one
to
the
other
as
though
he
expected
to
see
his
advice
accepted
and
put
into
immediate
practice
johnnie
laughed
pap
she
said
with
shining
eyes
if
you
get
me
a
husband
i
have
to
give
you
a
commission
on
it
looks
like
i
ca
noways
get
one
for
myself
do
it
she
passed
into
the
house
and
shade
regarded
his
ally
in
helpless
anger
that
the
way
she
talks
here
lately
he
growled
seems
like
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
come
to
something
and
by
the
lord
it
would
with
any
other
gal
i
ever
seed
or
with
johnnie
like
she
was
when
she
first
came
down
here
but
these
days
and
times
she
got
a
way
of
puttin
me
off
that
i
ca
seem
to
get
around
neither
man
quite
understood
the
power
of
that
mental
culture
which
johnnie
was
assimilating
so
avidly
that
reading
things
in
a
book
should
enable
her
a
child
a
girl
a
helpless
woman
to
negative
their
wishes
smilingly
this
would
have
been
a
thing
quite
outside
the
comprehension
of
either
aunt
mavity
wants
me
to
go
down
to
the
store
for
her
johnnie
announced
returning
any
of
you
girls
like
to
come
along
mandy
had
parted
her
lips
to
accept
the
general
invitation
when
shade
buckheath
rose
to
his
feet
and
announced
curtly
i
go
with
you
his
glance
added
that
nobody
else
was
wanted
and
mandy
subsided
into
a
seat
on
the
steps
and
watched
the
two
walk
away
side
by
side
looks
like
you
ai
just
so
awful
pleased
to
have
me
boardin
with
pap
shade
began
truculently
when
it
appeared
that
the
girl
was
not
going
to
open
any
conversation
with
him
maybe
you
was
for
my
company
down
street
this
evenin
no
said
johnnie
bluntly
but
very
quietly
i
wish
you
had
come
to
the
house
to
board
i
have
told
you
to
let
me
alone
shade
laughed
an
exasperated
mirthless
laugh
you
know
well
enough
what
made
me
do
it
he
said
sullenly
if
you
do
want
me
to
board
with
pap
himes
you
can
stop
it
any
day
you
say
the
word
you
promise
to
wed
me
and
i
go
back
to
the
inn
the
lord
knows
they
feed
you
better
thar
and
i
believe
in
my
soul
the
gals
at
pap
himes
will
run
me
crazy
but
as
long
as
you
hang
off
the
way
you
do
about
our
marryin
and
i
git
word
of
you
carryin
on
with
other
folks
i
goin
to
stay
where
i
can
watch
you
other
folks
echoed
johnnie
colour
coming
into
her
cheeks
shade
there
no
use
of
your
quarrelling
with
me
and
i
see
it
what
settin
out
to
do
yes
other
folks
gray
stoddard
for
instance
i
ai
got
no
auto
to
take
you
out
ridin
in
but
you
a
blame
sight
safer
with
me
than
you
are
with
him
and
if
i
was
to
carry
word
to
your
mother
or
your
uncle
pros
about
your
doin
they
say
the
last
word
my
uncle
pros
left
with
ma
to
give
me
was
that
you
bear
watchin
shade
buckheath
laughed
johnnie
her
face
breaking
up
into
sweet
sudden
mirth
at
the
folly
of
it
all
you
not
aimin
for
my
good
i
do
see
what
on
earth
makes
you
talk
like
you
wanted
to
marry
me
because
i
do
said
buckheath
helplessly
he
wondered
if
the
girl
did
not
herself
know
her
own
attractions
forgetful
that
he
had
not
seen
them
plainly
till
a
man
higher
placed
in
the
social
scale
set
the
cachet
of
a
gentleman
admiration
upon
them
chapter
xii
the
contents
of
a
bandanna
it
was
a
breathless
august
evening
all
day
the
land
had
lain
humming
and
quivering
beneath
the
glare
of
the
sun
it
seemed
that
such
heat
must
culminate
in
a
thunder
shower
even
pap
himes
had
sought
the
coolest
corner
of
the
porch
his
pipe
put
out
as
adding
too
much
to
the
general
swelter
and
the
hot
yellow
cat
perched
at
a
discreet
distance
the
old
man
dreamy
eyes
were
fixed
with
a
sort
of
animal
content
on
the
winding
road
that
disappeared
in
the
rise
of
the
gap
if
was
his
boast
that
god
almighty
never
made
a
day
too
hot
for
him
and
to
the
marrow
of
them
his
rheumatic
bones
felt
and
savoured
the
comfort
of
this
blistering
weather
high
up
on
the
road
he
had
noted
a
small
moving
speck
that
appeared
and
disappeared
as
the
foliage
hid
it
or
gaps
in
the
trees
revealed
it
it
was
not
yet
time
for
the
mill
operatives
to
be
out
but
as
he
glanced
eagerly
in
the
direction
of
the
buildings
the
gates
opened
and
the
streamed
forth
pap
had
matters
of
some
importance
to
discuss
with
shade
buckheath
and
he
was
glad
to
see
the
young
man
figure
come
swinging
down
the
street
the
two
were
soon
deep
in
a
whispered
discussion
their
heads
bent
close
together
the
little
speck
far
up
the
road
between
the
trees
announced
itself
to
the
eye
now
as
a
moving
figure
walking
down
toward
cottonville
well
i
read
it
again
if
you
do
believe
me
buckheath
said
impatiently
all
that
alabama
mill
wants
is
to
have
me
go
over
there
and
put
this
trick
on
their
jennies
and
if
it
works
they
give
us
a
royalty
of
well
i
make
the
bargain
or
i
will
countered
pap
swiftly
you
inquired
shade
contemptuously
time
they
wrote
some
of
the
business
down
and
you
could
read
it
whar
you
be
and
whar
our
money
be
the
moving
speck
on
the
road
appeared
at
this
time
to
be
the
figure
of
a
tall
man
walking
unsteadily
reeling
from
side
to
side
of
the
road
yet
approaching
the
village
shade
pacified
himes
with
a
truckling
manner
that
the
younger
aggressions
were
apt
to
call
out
in
him
you
know
i
do
mean
anything
against
you
but
i
believe
in
my
soul
i
ruther
sell
out
the
patent
that
man
in
lowell
said
he
give
twenty
thousand
dollars
if
it
was
proved
to
work
now
did
he
yes
and
by
the
time
it
proved
to
work
we
have
made
three
times
that
much
out
of
it
there
ai
a
spinning
mill
in
the
country
that
wo
save
money
by
putting
in
the
indicator
and
paying
us
a
good
royalty
on
it
if
johnnie
and
me
was
wedded
i
go
to
work
advertising
the
thing
the
gal
ai
in
the
mill
this
afternoon
is
she
asked
old
himes
no
she
gone
off
somewheres
with
some
folks
hardwick
has
got
here
if
you
want
to
find
her
these
days
you
got
to
hunt
in
some
of
the
swell
houses
round
on
the
hills
he
spoke
with
bitterness
and
pap
nodded
comprehendingly
the
subject
was
an
old
one
between
them
then
shade
drew
from
his
pocket
a
letter
and
prepared
to
read
it
once
more
to
the
older
man
whar
johnnie
himes
started
so
violently
that
he
disturbed
the
equilibrium
of
his
chair
and
brought
the
front
legs
to
the
floor
with
a
slam
so
that
he
sat
staring
straight
ahead
shade
buckheath
whirled
and
saw
pros
passmore
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
the
moving
speck
come
to
full
size
the
old
man
was
a
figure
than
usual
he
had
no
hat
on
and
a
bloody
cloth
bound
around
his
head
confined
the
straggling
gray
locks
quaintly
the
face
was
ghastly
the
clothing
in
tatters
and
his
hands
trembled
as
they
clutched
a
bandanna
evidently
full
of
some
small
articles
that
rattled
together
in
his
shaking
grasp
good
lord
pros
you
mighty
nigh
scared
me
out
of
a
year
growth
grumbled
pap
hitching
vainly
to
throw
his
chair
back
into
position
come
in
come
in
you
look
like
you
been
seein
trouble
whar
johnnie
repeated
old
pros
hollowly
it
was
the
younger
man
who
answered
this
time
with
an
ugly
lift
of
the
lip
over
his
teeth
between
a
sneer
and
a
snarl
she
gone
gaddin
around
with
some
of
her
swell
friends
she
may
be
home
before
midnight
an
then
again
she
may
not
he
said
the
old
man
collapsed
on
the
lower
step
i
johnnie
was
here
he
said
querulously
i
he
looked
about
him
confusedly
i
found
her
silver
mine
at
the
words
the
two
on
the
porch
became
suddenly
rigid
then
buckheath
sprang
down
the
steps
caught
passmore
under
the
and
half
led
half
dragged
him
up
to
a
chair
into
which
he
thrust
him
with
little
ceremony
he
stood
before
the
limp
figure
peering
into
the
newcomer
face
with
eyes
of
greed
and
hands
that
clenched
and
unclenched
themselves
automatically
you
found
the
silver
mine
he
volleyed
excitedly
whose
land
is
it
on
have
you
got
options
yet
my
grandpappy
always
said
they
was
a
silver
mine
hush
pap
himes
voice
hissed
across
the
loud
explosive
tones
no
need
to
tell
your
business
to
the
town
i
bet
pros
ai
thought
about
no
options
yit
he
may
need
friends
to
him
out
on
such
matters
and
here
you
and
me
buck
god
knows
he
could
have
better
ones
the
old
man
stared
about
him
in
a
dazed
fashion
i
got
my
specimens
in
this
here
bandanner
he
explained
quaveringly
i
fell
over
the
ledge
was
the
way
i
chanced
upon
it
at
the
last
and
i
lay
dead
for
a
spell
my
head
busted
right
bad
but
the
ore
specimens
they
right
here
in
the
bandanner
and
i
aimed
to
give
to
johnnie
to
put
right
in
her
lap
the
best
gal
that
ever
was
and
say
to
her
your
silver
mine
honey
that
your
old
uncle
found
for
ye
now
you
can
live
like
a
lady
that
what
i
aimed
to
say
to
johnnie
i
did
aim
that
nobody
else
should
tetch
them
samples
till
she
saw
himes
and
buckheath
were
exchanging
glances
across
the
old
man
bent
gray
head
common
humanity
would
have
suggested
that
they
offer
him
rest
or
refreshment
but
these
two
were
intent
only
on
what
the
bandanna
held
what
is
it
in
the
thought
of
wealth
from
the
ground
that
so
intoxicates
so
ravishes
away
from
all
reasonable
judgment
the
generality
of
mankind
people
never
seem
to
conceive
that
there
might
be
no
more
than
moderate
repayal
for
great
toil
in
a
mine
of
any
sort
the
very
word
mine
suggests
to
them
tapping
the
vast
of
the
world
and
drawing
an
unlimited
share
wealth
lavish
prodigal
intemperate
these
two
were
as
mad
with
greed
at
the
thought
of
the
silver
mine
in
the
mountains
as
ever
were
in
the
golden
days
of
california
or
those
more
recent
ignoble
martyrs
who
strewed
their
bones
along
the
icy
trails
of
the
klondike
ye
better
let
me
look
at
pros
wheedled
pap
himes
i
know
a
heap
about
silver
ore
i
worked
in
the
georgia
gold
mines
and
you
know
you
never
find
gold
without
silver
i
was
three
months
in
the
mountains
with
a
feller
that
was
huntin
nickel
he
me
a
heap
the
old
man
turned
his
disappointed
gaze
from
one
face
to
the
other
i
johnnie
was
here
he
repeated
his
plaintive
formula
as
he
raised
the
handkerchief
and
untied
the
corners
pap
glanced
apprehensively
up
and
down
the
street
buckheath
ran
to
the
door
and
shut
it
that
none
in
the
house
might
see
or
overhear
and
then
the
three
stared
at
the
earthy
bits
of
mineral
in
silence
finally
himes
put
down
a
stubby
forefinger
and
stirred
them
meaninglessly
le
me
try
one
with
my
knife
he
whispered
as
though
there
were
any
one
to
hear
him
all
right
returned
the
old
man
nervelessly
but
hit
ai
soft
enough
for
lead
if
that
what
you
meanin
i
know
that
much
a
lead
mine
is
a
mighty
good
thing
worth
as
much
as
silver
maybe
but
this
ai
lead
a
curious
tremor
had
come
over
pap
himes
face
as
he
furtively
compared
the
lump
of
ore
he
held
in
his
hand
with
something
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
he
seemed
to
come
to
some
sudden
resolution
no
lead
and
nothin
he
declared
contemptuously
flinging
the
bit
he
held
back
into
the
handkerchief
pros
passmore
ye
old
fool
you
come
down
here
and
work
us
all
up
over
some
truck
that
was
worth
turnin
with
a
spade
you
might
as
well
throw
them
things
away
whar
in
the
nation
did
you
git
anyhow
passmore
stumbled
to
his
feet
he
had
eaten
nothing
for
three
days
the
fall
over
the
ledge
had
injured
him
severely
he
was
scarcely
sane
at
the
moment
ai
they
no
he
asked
pitifully
why
i
made
shore
they
was
silver
well
he
looked
aimlessly
about
i
better
go
find
johnnie
and
he
started
down
the
steps
leave
here

and
go
in

you
a

suggested
pap
in
a
kinder
tone
the
bandanna
slipped
rattling
from
the
old
man
relaxed
fingers
the
specimens
clattered
and
rolled
on
the
porch
floor
with
drooping
head
he
shambled
through
the
door
a
woman
face
disappeared
for
a
moment
from
the
shadowy
window
only
to
reappear
and
watch
unseen
mavity
was
listening
in
a
sort
of
horror
as
she
heard
her
father
tones
git
down
and
pick
up
every

you
miss

pap
casting
himself
upon
the
handkerchief
and
its
contents
what

questioned
buckheath
keenly
i

you
had
some
game

hastened

and
find
whar
the
mine
is
at
and
we
the
two
men
squatted
on
the
floor
tallying
over
the
specimens
they
had
already
collected
and
looking
about
them
for
more
in
the
doorway
behind
them
appeared
a
face
gaunt
grimed
a
bandage
around
the
brow
and
a
pair
of
glowing
burning
eyes
looking
out
beneath
uncle
pros
had
failed
to
find
mavity
bence
and
was
returning
too
dazed
to
comprehend
mere
words
the
old
prospector
read
instantly
and
aright
the
attitude
and
expression
of
the
two
as
they
tied
the
last
knot
in
the
handkerchief
he
loomed
above

shaking

roared

buckheath
attempted
to
reassure
him
the
old
man
bent
forward
and
shot
down
a
long
arm
to
recover
his
own
he
missed
the
bandanna
and
the
impetus
of
the
movement
sent
him
staggering
a
pace
or
two
forward
at
the
porch
edge
he
strove
to
recover
himself
failed
and
with
a
short
coughing
groan
pitched
down

chapter
xiii
a
patient
for
the
hospital
when
the
hardwick
carriage
drove
up
in
the
heavy
august
night
and
stopped
at
the
gate
to
let
johnnie
consadine
out
pap
was
blazing
with
light
from
window
and
doorway
clacking
and
humming
like
a
mill
with
the
sound
of
noisy
footsteps
and
voices
three
or
four
men
argued
and
talked
loudly
on
the
porch
through
the
open
windows
of
the
front
room
johnnie
had
a
glimpse
of
a
long
stark
figure
lying
on
the
lounge
and
a
white
face
which
struck
her
with
a
strange
pang
of
vague
yet
alarming
resemblance
she
made
her
hasty
thanks
to
miss
sessions
and
hurried
in
gray
stoddard
horse
was
standing
at
the
hitching
post
in
front
and
gray
met
her
at
the
head
of
the
steps
stoddard
looked
particularly
himself
in
riding
dress
its
more
unconventional
lines
suited
him
well
the
norfolk
the
leathern
puttees
gave
an
adventurous
turn
to
the
expression
of
a
personality
which
was
only
so
on
the
mental
side
he
always
rode
bareheaded
and
the
brown
hair
which
he
wore
a
little
longer
than
other
men
was
tossed
from
its
masculine
primness
to
certain
hyacinthine
lines
which
were
becoming
just
now
his
clear
brown
eyes
were
luminous
with
feeling
he
put
out
a
swift
detaining
hand
and
caught
hers
laying
sympathetic
fingers
over
the
clasp
and
retaining
it
as
he
spoke
i
so
relieved
that
you
come
at
last
he
said
we
need
somebody
of
intelligence
here
i
just
happened
to
come
past
a
few
minutes
after
the
accident
do
be
frightened
your
uncle
came
down
to
see
you
and
got
a
fall
somehow
he
hurt
pretty
badly
i
afraid
and
these
people
are
refusing
to
have
him
taken
to
the
hospital
on
the
one
side
himes
and
buckheath
drew
back
and
regarded
this
scene
with
angry
derision
in
the
carriage
below
lydia
sessions
who
could
hear
nothing
that
was
said
stared
incredulously
and
moved
as
though
to
get
down
and
join
johnnie
you
want
him
sent
to
the
hospital
stoddard
urged
half
interrogatively
look
in
there
listen
to
the
noise
this
is
no
fit
place
for
a
man
with
a
possible
fracture
of
the
skull
yes
oh
yes
agreed
johnnie
promptly
if
i
could
nurse
him
myself
i
like
to
or
help
but
of
course
he
got
to
go
to
the
hospital
first
of
everything
stoddard
motioned
the
hardwick
driver
to
wait
and
called
down
to
the
carriage
load
i
want
you
people
to
drive
round
by
the
hospital
and
send
the
ambulance
if
you
be
so
kind
there
a
man
hurt
in
here
lydia
sessions
made
this
an
immediate
pretext
for
getting
down
and
coming
in
did
you
say
they
did
want
to
send
him
to
the
hospital
she
inquired
sharply
and
openly
in
her
tactless
fashion
as
she
crossed
the
sidewalk
that
the
worst
thing
about
such
people
you
provide
them
with
the
best
and
they
do
know
enough
to
appreciate
it
have
they
got
a
doctor
or
done
anything
for
the
poor
man
i
sent
for
millsaps
here
he
knows
more
about
broken
bones
than
anybody
in
cottonville
pap
offered
sullenly
mopping
his
brow
and
shaking
his
bald
head
millsaps
is
a
decent
man
you
know
what
to
do
to
the
sick
is
he
a
doctor
asked
stoddard
sternly
looking
the
lank
shuffling
individual
named
he
can
doctor
a
cow
or
a
nag
anybody
ever
saw
pap
put
forward
rather
shamefacedly
a
veterinarian
commented
stoddard
well
they
gone
for
the
ambulance
and
the
surgeon
will
soon
be
here
now
i
do
know
nothin
about
veterinarians
and
surgeons
growled
pap
still
alternately
mopping
his
bald
head
and
shaking
it
contemptuously
but
i
know
that
millsaps
ai
to
box
up
any
dead
bodies
and
send
to
the
medical
colleges
and
i
know
he
made
as
pretty
a
job
of
doctoring
old
spotty
has
ever
i
seen
to
be
shore
the
cow
died
but
he
got
the
medicine
down
her
when
it
did
look
as
if
human
hands
could
do
it
that
the
kind
of
doctor
he
is
i
aim
to
give
passmore
a
teaspoonful
of
lamp
oil
karosene
said
the
cow
doctor
coming
forward
evidently
feeling
that
it
was
time
he
spoke
up
himself
lamp
oil
is
mighty
rousin
to
them
as
late
like
doin
i
used
copperas
for
such
but
takes
longer
some
say
a
dose
of
turpentine
is
better
lamp
oil
but
i
both
of
wo
hurt
johnnie
pushed
past
them
all
into
the
front
room
where
the
women
were
running
about
talking
lot
and
exclaiming
a
kerosene
lamp
without
a
chimney
smoked
and
flared
on
the
table
filling
the
room
with
evil
odours
pros
passmore
white
face
thrown
up
against
the
lounge
cushion
was
the
only
quiet
dignified
object
in
sight
mandy
said
johnnie
catching
the
meacham
woman
by
the
elbow
as
she
passed
her
bearing
a
small
kerosene
can

go
up
to
my
room
and

the
good
lamp

johnnie
honey

when
johnnie
turned
to
her
uncle
she
found
millsaps
bending
above
him
the
small
can
in
his
hands
its
spout
approached
to
the
rigid
blue
lips
of
the
patient
with
the
unconcern
of
a
man
about
to
fill
a
lamp
she
sprang
forward
and
caught
his
arm
bringing
the
can
away
with
a
clatter
and
splash
you
must
do
that
she
said
authoritatively
the
doctors
will
be
here
in
a
minute
you
must
give
him
anything
mr
millsaps
oh
all
right
all
right
agreed
millsaps
with
decidedly
the
air
that
he
considered
it
all
wrong
there
is
some
people
that
has
objections
to
having
their
cyarved
up
by
student
doctors
then
agin
there
is
others
that
has
no
better
use
for
kin
than
to
let
be
so
treated
i
that
a
little
dosin
of
lamp
oil
never
hurt
nobody
and
it
cured
of
most
any
kind
of
disease
but
just
as
you
say
just
as
you
say
and
he
shuffled
angrily
from
the
room
johnnie
went
and
knelt
by
the
lounge
with
deft
careful
fingers
she
lifted
the
wet
cloths
above
the
bruised
forehead
the
hurt
looked
old
no
blood
was
flowing
and
she
wondered
a
little
catching
shade
buckheath
eye
fixed
on
her
from
outside
the
window
she
beckoned
him
in
and
asked
him
to
tell
her
exactly
how
the
trouble
came
about
buckheath
gave
her
his
own
version
of
the
matter
omitting
of
course
all
mention
of
the
bandanna
full
of
ore
which
lay
now
carefully
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
old
gideon
himes
trunk
and
you
say
he
fell
down
the
steps
asked
johnnie
who
was
with
him
who
saw
it
nobody
but
me
and
pap
shade
answered
trying
to
give
the
reply
unconcernedly
i
i
seen
it
whispered
mavity
bence
plucking
at
johnnie
sleeve
i
was
in
the
fore
room
here
and
i
seen
it
all
she
spoke
defiantly
but
her
terrified
glance
barely
raised
itself
to
the
menacing
countenances
of
the
two
men
on
the
other
side
of
the
lounge
and
fell
at
once
i
never
heard
nothin
they
was
sayin
she
made
haste
to
add
but
i
seen
pros
fall
and
i
run
out
and
helped
pap
and
shade
fetch
him
in
peculiar
as
was
the
attitude
of
all
three
johnnie
felt
a
certain
relief
in
the
implied
assurance
that
there
had
been
no
quarrel
that
her
uncle
had
not
been
struck
or
knocked
down
the
steps
why
pap
she
said
kindly
looking
across
at
the
old
man
perturbed
sweating
face
you
surely
ai
like
these
foolish
folks
round
here
in
cottonville
that
think
the
hospital
was
started
up
to
get
dead
bodies
for
the
student
doctors
to
cut
to
pieces
you
see
how
bad
off
uncle
pros
is
you
must
know
he
bound
to
be
better
taken
care
of
there
in
that
fine
building
and
with
all
those
folks
that
have
learned
their
business
to
take
care
of
him
than
here
in
this
house
with
only
me
besides
i
could
even
stay
at
home
from
the
mill
to
nurse
him
somebody
got
to
earn
the
money
i
would
charge
you
no
board
johnnie
fairly
whined
himes
willin
to
nurse
pros
myself
without
night
and
day
you
speak
up
mighty
fine
for
that
thar
hospital
what
about
lura
dawson
everybody
knows
they
shipped
her
body
to
cincinnati
and
sold
it
you
ort
to
be
ashamed
to
put
your
poor
old
uncle
in
such
a
place
johnnie
turned
puzzled
eyes
from
the
rigid
face
on
the
lounge
pros
had
neither
moved
nor
spoken
since
they
lifted
and
laid
him
there
to
the
old
man
at
the
window
that
pap
himes
should
be
concerned
even
slightly
about
the
welfare
of
any
living
being
save
himself
struck
her
as
wildly
improbable
then
swiftly
she
reproached
herself
for
not
being
readier
to
believe
good
of
him
he
and
uncle
pros
had
been
boys
together
and
she
knew
her
uncle
one
to
deserve
affection
though
he
seldom
commanded
it
there
was
a
sound
of
wheels
outside
and
gray
stoddard
voice
with
that
of
the
doctor
shade
and
pap
himes
still
hovered
nervously
about
the
window
staring
in
and
hearkening
to
all
that
was
said
mavity
bence
had
wept
till
her
face
was
sodden
she
herded
the
other
girls
back
out
of
the
way
but
watched
everything
with
terrified
eyes
he
jest
about
come
to
hisself
befo
he
dies
the
older
conspirator
muttered
to
shade
as
the
stretcher
passed
them
and
the
skilled
attendants
laid
pros
passmore
in
the
vehicle
without
so
much
as
disturbing
his
breathing
he
jest
about
come
to
hisself
thar
and
them
pesky
doctors
have
word
about
the
silver
mine
well
in
this
world
them
that
has
gits
mostly
ef
johnnie
consadine
had
been
any
manner
o
kin
to
me
i
vow
i
taken
a
hickory
to
her
when
she
set
up
her
word
agin
mine
and
let
him
go
out
of
the
house
the
little
fool
she
did
know
what
she
was
sendin
away
and
so
pros
passmore
was
taken
to
the
hospital
his
bandanna
full
of
ore
remained
buried
at
the
bottom
of
gideon
himes
trunk
to
be
fished
up
often
by
the
old
sinner
fingered
and
fondled
and
laid
back
in
hiding
while
the
man
who
had
carried
it
down
the
mountains
to
fling
it
in
johnnie
lap
lay
with
locked
lips
and
told
neither
the
doctors
nor
himes
where
the
silver
mine
was
august
sweated
itself
away
september
wore
on
into
october
in
a
procession
of
days
and
still
uncle
pros
gave
no
sign
of
actual
recovery
johnnie
was
working
hard
in
the
mill
hartley
sessions
had
become
in
his
cold
lifeless
fashion
very
much
her
friend
inert
slow
he
had
one
qualification
for
his
position
he
could
choose
an
assistant
or
delegate
authority
with
good
judgment
and
he
found
in
johnnie
consadine
an
adjutant
so
reliable
so
apt
and
of
such
ability
that
he
continually
pushed
more
work
upon
her
if
pay
and
honours
did
not
always
follow
in
adequate
measure
for
a
time
much
as
she
disliked
to
approach
shade
with
any
request
johnnie
continued
to
urge
him
whenever
they
met
to
finish
up
the
indicators
and
let
her
have
them
back
again
then
hartley
sessions
promoted
her
to
a
better
position
in
the
weaving
department
and
other
cares
drove
the
matter
from
her
mind
the
condition
of
uncle
pros
added
fearfully
to
the
drains
upon
her
time
and
thought
the
old
man
lay
in
his
hospital
cot
till
the
great
frame
had
wasted
fairly
to
the
big
bones
following
her
movements
when
she
came
into
the
room
with
strange
questioning
unrecognizing
eyes
yet
always
quieted
and
soothed
by
her
presence
so
that
she
felt
urged
to
give
him
every
moment
she
could
steal
from
her
work
the
hurts
on
his
head
which
were
mere
scalp
wounds
healed
over
the
surgeon
at
the
hospital
was
unable
to
find
any
indentation
or
injury
to
the
skull
itself
which
would
account
for
the
old
man
condition
they
talked
for
a
long
time
of
an
operation
and
did
finally
trephine
without
result
they
would
make
an
photograph
they
said
when
he
should
be
strong
enough
to
stand
it
as
a
means
of
further
investigation
meantime
his
expenses
though
made
fairly
nominal
to
her
cut
into
the
money
which
johnnie
could
send
to
her
mother
and
she
was
full
of
anxiety
for
the
helpless
little
family
left
without
head
or
protector
up
in
that
gash
of
the
mountains
on
the
flank
of
big
unaka
in
these
days
shade
buckheath
vacillated
from
the
suppliant
attitude
to
the
threatening
johnnie
never
knew
when
she
met
him
which
would
be
uppermost
and
since
he
had
wearied
out
her
gratitude
and
liking
she
cared
little
one
thing
surprised
and
touched
her
a
bit
and
that
was
that
shade
used
to
meet
her
of
an
evening
when
she
would
be
coming
from
the
hospital
and
ask
eagerly
after
the
welfare
of
uncle
pros
he
finally
begged
her
to
get
him
a
chance
to
see
the
old
man
and
she
did
so
but
his
presence
seemed
to
have
such
a
disturbing
effect
on
the
patient
that
the
doctors
prohibited
further
visits
well
i
done
just
like
you
told
me
to
and
them
cussed
sawboneses
let
me
go
back
no
more
shade
reported
to
pap

that
evening
old

just
swelled
hisself

hollered
at
me
time

day

retorted
pap
himes
testily
why

be
done
with

consadine
and

and

mountains
and

and
i
stand
by
ye
in
the
business
a
slow
but
ample
grin
dawned
on
the
old
man
round
foolish
face
he
looked
admiringly
at
shade
by
gosh
he
said
finally
that
ai
no
bad
notion
neither

thar
laurelly

bragged
about

put
in
buckheath
grimly
you
git
down
in

collar
and
pull
the
old
man
gave
him
no
heed
he
was
still
grinning
fatuously
it
me
of
zack
shalliday
and
the
way
he
got
wedded
came
the
unctuous
chuckle
zack
was
a
man
my
age
and
his
daughter
was
house
for
him
she
was
a
fine
hand
to
work
the
best
butter
maker
on
the
unakas
zack
always
traded
his
butter
for
a
extry
price
but
old
as
sis
shalliday
was
she
must
been
all
of
along
comes
a
man
that
takes
a
notion
to
her

he
give
me
to
hunt
me
up
one
that
as
good
a
butter
maker
as

i
got
no
objections
then
he
took
hisself
down
to
preacher
blaylock
knowin
in
reason
that
preachers
was
always
hungry
for
weddin
fees
and
would
hustle
round
to
make

he
offered
the
preacher
a
dollar
to
give
him
a
list
of
names
of
single
women
that

says

all
depends
on
which
one
makes
the
best
butter
anyhow
well
he
took
that
thar
string
o
names
and
he
left
about
sundown
here
he
is
back
and
hollerin
at
the
fence
out
here
preacher
i
got
her
he
had
a
woman
in
his
buggy

a
kind
of
whisper

says
zack

i
was
quite
satisfied
in
my
mind
about

as
i
was
goin
along
the
road
toward
the
last
name

and
she
rid
with

a
spell

chanced
to
tell

she
let
on
that
she
was
a
widder
and
showed
me
the
butter

off
of
one
cow
and
the
calf
is
three
months
old
i
was
to

a
matter
and

the
storekeeper

extry
for
that
thar
butter
and
here

knot
preacher

ready
for

and
we
must
be
gittin
along

milkin
time
the
preacher
he
tied
the
knot
and
shalliday
and
the
new
miz
shalliday
they
got
along
home
the
old
man
chuckled
as
he
had
at
the
beginning
of
this
tale
well
that
was
business
agreed
shade
impatiently
when
are
you
to
start
for
big
unaka
the
old
man
rolled
his
great
head
between
his
shoulders
he
assented
business
but
it
was
bad
business
for
zack
shalliday
that
thar
woman
never
made
a
lick
of
that
butter
she
was
a
packin
to
the
settlement
to
trade
for
her
sister
that
was
one
o
them
widders
the
preacher
had
give
him
the
name
of
seems
shalliday
woman
had
jest
come
in
from
over
on
big
smoky
and
she
turned
out
to
be
the
laziest
critter
on
the
unakas
she
did
know
which
end
of
a
was
made
for
use
aw
law
huh
business
there
two
kinds
of
business
but
that
was
a
bad
business
for
zack
shalliday
i
reckon
i
go
up
on
unaka
if
mavity
can
run
the
house
without
me
chapter
xiv
wedding
bells
a
vine
on
mavity
bence
porch
turned
to
blood
crimson
its
leaves
parted
from
the
stem
in
the
gay
autumn
wind
and
sifted
lightly
down
to
join
the
painted
foliage
of
the
two
little
maples
which
struggled
for
existence
against
an
adverse
world
crouching
beaten
and
torn
at
the
curb
in
these
days
johnnie
used
to
leave
the
mill
in
the
evening
and
go
directly
to
the
hospital
gray
stoddard
was
her
one
source
of
comfort
and
terror
uncle
pros
injuries
brought
these
two
into
closer
relations
than
anything
had
yet
done
so
far
johnnie
had
conducted
her
affairs
with
a
judgment
and
propriety
extraordinary
clinging
as
it
were
to
the
skirts
of
lydia
sessions
keeping
that
not
unwilling
lady
between
her
and
stoddard
always
but
the
injured
man
took
a
great
fancy
to
gray
johnnie
he
had
forgotten
shade
and
pap
himes
he
recognized
only
by
an
irritation
which
made
the
doctors
exclude
them
from
his
presence
but
something
in
stoddard
equable
disciplined
personality
appealed
to
and
soothed
uncle
pros
when
even
johnnie
failed
the
old
mountaineer
had
gone
back
to
childhood
he
would
lie
by
the
hour
murmuring
a
boy
woods
lore
to
gray
stoddard
communicating
deep
secrets
of
where
a
bee
tree
might
be
found
where
known
only
to
him
there
was
a
deeply
hidden
spring
of
pure
freestone
water
so
cold
make
yo
teeth
chatter
and
which
one
of
old
lead
pups
seemed
likely
to
turn
out
the
best
coon
dog
when
stoddard
presence
and
help
had
been
proffered
to
herself
johnnie
had
not
failed
to
find
a
gracious
way
of
declining
or
avoiding
but
you
can
not
reprove
a
sick
man
a
dying
man
she
could
not
for
the
life
of
her
find
a
way
to
insist
that
uncle
pros
make
less
demand
on
the
young
mill
owner
time
and
so
the
two
of
them
met
often
at
the
bedside
and
that
trouble
which
was
beginning
to
make
johnnie
heart
like
lead
grew
with
the
growing
love
gray
stoddard
commanded
she
told
herself
mercilessly
that
it
was
presumption
folly
wickedness
she
was
always
going
to
be
done
with
it
but
once
more
in
his
presence
her
very
soul
cried
out
that
she
was
indeed
fit
at
least
to
love
him
if
not
to
hope
for
his
love
in
turn
stoddard
himself
was
touched
by
the
old
man
fancy
and
showed
a
devotion
and
patience
that
were
characteristic
if
she
was
kept
late
at
the
hospital
mavity
put
by
a
bite
of
cold
supper
for
her
and
mandy
always
waited
to
see
that
she
had
what
she
wanted
on
the
day
after
shade
buckheath
and
gideon
himes
had
come
to
their
agreement
she
stopped
at
the
hospital
for
a
briefer
stay
than
usual
her
uncle
was
worse
and
an
opiate
had
been
administered
to
quiet
him
so
that
she
only
sat
a
while
at
the
bedside
and
finally
took
her
way
homeward
in
a
state
of
utter
depression
for
which
she
could
scarcely
account
it
was
dusk
almost
dark
when
she
reached
the
gate
and
she
noted
carelessly
a
vehicle
drawn
up
before
it
johnnie
called
her
mother
voice
from
the
back
of
the
rickety
old
wagon
as
the
girl
was
turning
in
toward
the
steps
sis
johnnie
sis
johnnie
crowed
deanie
and
then
she
was
aware
of
sober
milo
climbing
down
over
the
wheel
and
trying
to
help
lissy
while
pony
got
in
his
way
and
was
gravely
reproved
she
ran
to
the
wheel
and
put
up
ready
arms
why
honeys
she
exclaimed
how
come
never
let
me
know
to
expect
you
oh

so
glad
mother
i
did
intend
to
send
you
word
to

but
i
was
feeling
so
blue
i
sure
wanted
to
maybe
uncle
pros
might
know
you
or
the
baby
and
it
would
do
him
good
she
had
got
little
deanie
out
in
her
arms
now
and
stood
hugging
the
child
bending
to
kiss
melissa
finding
a
hand
to
pat
milo
shoulder
and
rub
pony
tousled
poll
oh
i
so
glad
i
so
glad
to
see
she
kept
repeating
who
brought
you
she
looked
closely
at
the
man
on
the
driver
seat
and
recognized
gideon
himes
why
pap
she
exclaimed
i
never
forget
you
for
this
it
was
mighty
good
of
you
the
door
swung
open
letting
out
a
path
of
light
aunt
mavity
cried
the
girl
mother
and
the
children
have
come
down
to
see
me
is
it
fine
mavity
bence
made
her
appearance
in
the
doorway
her
faded
eyes
so
reddened
with
weeping
that
she
looked
like
a
woman
in
a
fever
she
gulped
and
stared
from
her
father
where
in
the
shine
of
her
upheld
lamp
he
sat
blinking
and
grinning
to
laurella
consadine
in
a
ruffled
lawn
frock
with
a
big
hat
on
her
dark
curls
and
johnnie
consadine
with
the
children
clinging
about
her
have
ye
told
her
she
gasped
and
at
the
tone
johnnie
turned
quickly
a
sudden
chill
falling
upon
her
glowing
mood
what
the
matter
she
asked
startled
clutching
the
baby
tighter
to
her
and
conning
over
with
quick
alarm
the
that
bobbed
and
surged
about
her
waist
the
children
are
all
right
are
they
milo
looked
up
apprehensively
he
was
an
little
fellow
already
beginning
to
have
a
stoop
to
his
thin
shoulders
the
bend
of
the
burden
bearer
i
i
done
the
best
i
could
sis
johnnie
he
hesitated
apologetically
you

thar
and
unc

an
i
thest
worked
the
farm
and
took
care
of
mother
an
the

when
she
when
he
oh

unc
pros
had
been
home
johnnie
her
mind
at
rest
about
the
children
turned
to
her
mother
was
ma
sick
she
asked
sympathetically
then
noticing
for
the
first
time
the
unwonted
gaiety
of
laurella
costume
the
glowing
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
she
smiled
in
relief
you
do
look
sick
my
but
you
fine
you
as
spick
and
span
as
a
bride
the
old
man
bent
and
spat
over
the
wheel
preparatory
to
speaking
but
his
daughter
took
the
words
from
his
mouth
she
is
a
bride
explained
mavity
bence
in
a
flatted
toneless
voice
leastways
pap
said
he
was
up
on
unaka
for
to
wed
her
and
bring
her
down
and
i
know
in
reason
she

him
johnnie
eyes
searched
her
mother
irresponsible
gypsy
face
now
johnnie
fretted
the
little
woman
how

bit
glad

the
lip
trembled
the
tragic
dark
brows
lifted
in
their
familiar
slant
come
on
in
the
house
said
johnnie
heavily
and
she
led
the
way
with
drooping
head
called
by
the
unusual
disturbance
mandy
left
the
supper
she
was
putting
on
the
table
for
johnnie
and
ran
into
the
front
hall
beulah
catlett
and
one
or
two
of
the
other
girls
had
crowded
behind
mavity
shoulders
and
were
staring
mandy
joined
them
in
time
to
hear
the
conclusion
of
mavity
explanation
she
came
through
the
door
and
passed
the
new
himes
on
the
porch
why
johnnie
consadine
she
cried
is
that
there
your
ma
johnnie
nodded
she
was

beulah

she
turned
to
follow
johnnie
who
was
mutely
starting
the
children
in
to
the
house
well
she
said
with
a
sigh
some
folks
gits
two
and
some
folks
git
nary
one
and
she
brought
up
the
rear
of
the
procession
ai
you
goin
to
pack
your
plunder
in
inquired
the
bridegroom
harshly
almost
threateningly
as
he
pitched
out
upon
the
path
a
number
of
bundles
and
boxes
i
reckon
they
wo
pester
it
till
you
git
back
from
puttin
up
the
nag
returned
laurella
carelessly
as
she
swung
her
light
frilled
skirts
and
tripped
across
the
porch
you
need
werry
about
me
she
called
down
to
the
old
fellow
where
he
sat
speechlessly
glaring
mavity
show
me
whar
i
can
sit
and
git
me
a
nice
cool
drink
and
that
all
i
need
for
one
while
pap
himes
mouth
was
open
but
no
words
came
he
finally
shut
it
with
that
click
of
the
false
teeth
which
was
familiar
and
terrible
to
everybody
at
the
shook
out
the
lines
over
the
old
horse
and
jogged
away
into
the
dusk
and
this
here
the
baby
admired
mandy
kneeling
in
front
of
little
deanie
when
the
newcomers
halted
in
the
front
room
why
johnnie
consadine
she
do
look
like
nothin
on
earth
but
a
little
copy
of
you
if
she
dispositioned
like
you
i
vow
i
just
about
love
her
to
death
mavity
bence
was
struggling
up
the
porch
steps
loaded
with
the
baggage
of
the
newcomers
better
leave
that
for
your
paw
the
bride
counselled
her
it
more
suited
to
a
man
person
to
lift
them
heavy
things
but
mavity
had
not
lived
with
pap
himes
for
nearly
forty
years
without
knowing
what
was
suited
to
him
in
distinction
perhaps
from
mankind
in
general
she
made
no
reply
but
continued
to
bring
in
the
baggage
and
johnnie
after
settling
her
mother
in
a
with
the
cool
drink
which
the
little
woman
had
specified
hurried
down
to
help
her

enthusiastically

johnnie
of
the
quare
notions

with
the
one
small
trunk
belonging
to
laurella

johnnie
when

little
used

glad

all
here
i
i
wish
uncle

able

folks
the
children
were
fed
milo
touchingly
subdued
and
apologetic
nestling
close
to
his
sister
side
and
whispering
to
her
how
he
had
tried
to
get
ma
to
wait
and
come
down
to
the
settlement
and
hungrily
begging
with
his
pathetic
childish
eyes
for
her
to
say
that
this
thing
which
had
come
upon
them
was
not
after
all
the
calamity
he
feared
pony
whose
two
front
teeth
had
come
in
quite
too
large
for
his
mouth
pony
with
the
pupils
and
the
temperament
that
would
cope
ill
with
disaster
addressed
himself
gaily
to
his
supper
and
saw
no
sorrow
anywhere
little
melissa
was
half
asleep
and
even
deanie
after
the
first
outburst
of
greeting
nodded
in
her
chair
i
got
ready
for
mavity
told
johnnie
in
an
undertone
after
her
father
returned
i
knowed
in
reason
he
bring
her
back
with
him
pap
always
has
his
own
way
and
gits
whatever
he
wants
i
you
take
the
baby
in
bed
with
you
and
i
put
a
pallet
in
your
room
for
lissy
johnnie
agreed
to
this
arrangement
almost
mechanically
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
her
mind
was
already
busy
with
the
barrier
this
must
set
between
herself
and
gray
stoddard
she
had
never
been
ashamed
of
her
origin
or
her
people
but
this
this
was
different
next
morning
she
sent
word
to
the
mill
foreman
to
put
on
a
substitute
and
took
the
morning
that
she
might
go
with
her
mother
to
the
hospital
passmore
was
asleep
and
they
were
not
allowed
to
disturb
him
but
on
the
steps
they
met
gray
stoddard
and
he
stopped
so
decidedly
to
speak
to
them
that
johnnie
could
not
exactly
run
away
as
she
felt
like
doing
your
mother
echoed
stoddard
when
johnnie
had
told
him
who
the
visitor
was
he
glanced
from
the
tall
daughter
to
the
lithe
little
gypsy
at
her
side
why
she
looks
more
like
your
sister
he
said
laurella
white
teeth
flashed
at
this
and
her
big
dark
eyes
glowed
johnnie
such
a
person
that
she
favours
older
than
her
years
the
mother
told
him
well
i
give
her
the
name
of
the
dead
and
they
say
that
makes
a
body
solemn
like
it
was
very
evident
that
stoddard
desired
to
detain
them
in
conversation
but
johnnie
smilingly
yet
with
decision
cut
the
interview
short
i
do
see
why
you
hurried
me
the
little
mother
said
resentfully
when
they
had
gone
a
few
steps
i
wanted
to
stay
and
talk
to
the
gentleman
if
you
did
i
think
he
one
of
the
nicest
persons
i
met
since
i
been
in
cottonville
gray
stoddard
how
come
you
never
mentioned
him
to
me
johnnie
she
turned
to
find
a
slow
painful
blush
rising
in
her
daughter
face
i
do
know
ma
said
johnnie
gently
i
reckon
it
was
because
i
did
seem
to
have
any
concern
with
a
rich
gentleman
such
as
stoddard
he
got
more
money
than
hardwick
they
say
more
than
anybody
else
in
cottonville
has
he
inquired
laurella
vivaciously
well
money
or
no
money
i
think
he
mighty
nice
looks
like
he
ai
studying
as
to
whether
you
got
money
or
not
and
if
you
was
meaning
that
you
did
think
yourself
fit
to
be
friends
with
such
why
i
ashamed
of
you
johnnie
consadine
the
passmores
and
the
consadines
are
as
good
a
family
as
there
is
on
unaka
mountains
i
do
know
as
i
ever
met
up
with
anybody
that
i
found
was
too
fine
for
my
company
and
whenever
your
uncle
pros
gets
well
and
finds
his
silver
mine
we
have
as
much
money
as
the
best
of
the
tears
blinded
johnnie
so
that
she
could
scarcely
find
her
way
and
the
voice
wherewith
she
would
have
answered
her
mother
caught
in
her
throat
she
pressed
her
lips
hard
together
and
shook
her
head
then
laughed
out
a
little
sobbing
laugh
poor
ma
poor
little
mother
she
whispered
at
length
you
ai
been
away
from
the
mountains
as
i
have
things
are
well
they
a
heap
different
here
in
the
settlement
they
a
heap
nicer
returned
laurella
blithely
well
i
mighty
glad
i
met
that
gentleman
this
morning
himes
was
talking
to
me
of
shade
buckheath
he
said
shade
was
wishful
to
wed
you
johnnie
and
wanted
me
to
give
the
boy
my
good
word
i
told
him
i
would
say
anything
and
then
afterward
i
was
going
to
but
since
seen
this
gentleman
and
know
that
his
likes
are
friends
of
well
i
johnnie
the
buckheaths
are
a
hard
nation
of
people
and
the
truth
if
you
wedded
shade
like
as
not
he
mistreat
you
oh
mother
do
pleaded
johnnie
scarlet
of
face
and
not
daring
to
raise
her
eyes
what
have
i
done
now
demanded
laurella
with
asperity
you
must
couple
my
name
with
stoddard
that
way
johnnie
told
her
he
never
thought
of
me
except
as
a
poor
girl
who
needs
help
mighty
bad
and
he
so
and
generous
he
ready
to
do
for
each
and
every
that
worthy
of
it
but
not
that
way
mother
you
must
ever
suppose
for
a
minute
that
he
think
of
me
in
that
way
well
i
i
may
never
laurella
exclaimed
did
i
mention
any
particular
way
that
the
man
was
supposed
to
be
thinking
about
you
i
speak
a
word
without
your
biting
my
head
off
for
it
as
for
what
gray
stoddard
thinks
of
you
let
me
tell
you
child
a
body
has
only
to
see
his
eyes
when
he
looking
at
you
mother
oh
mother
protested
johnnie
well
if
he
can
look
that
way
i
reckon
i
can
speak
of
it
returned
laurella
with
some
reason
i
want
you
to
promise
never
to
name
it
again
even
to
me
said
johnnie
solemnly
as
they
came
to
the
steps
of
the
big
house
you
surely
would
say
such
a
thing
to
any
one
else
i
wish
you
forget
it
yourself
hesitated
laurella
if
you
feel
so
strong
about
it
i
reckon
i
do
as
you
say
but
there
ai
anything
in
that
to
hinder
me
from
being
friends
with
stoddard
i
feel
sure
that
him
and
me
would
get
on
together
fine
he
favours
my
people
the
passmores
my
daddy
was
just
such
an
upstanding
feller
as
he
is
he
got
the
look
in
the
eye
too
johnnie
gasped
as
she
remembered
that
the
grandfather
of
whom
her
mother
spoke
was
virgil
passmore
and
called
to
mind
the
story
of
the
borrowed
wedding
coat
chapter
xv
the
feet
of
the
children
the
mountain
people
being
used
only
to
one
class
never
find
themselves
consciously
in
the
society
of
their
superiors
johnnie
consadine
had
been
unembarrassed
and
completely
mistress
of
the
situation
in
the
presence
of
charlie
conroy
who
did
not
fail
after
the
uplift
dance
to
make
some
further
effort
to
meet
the
big
girl
as
he
called
her
she
was
aware
that
social
overtures
from
such
a
person
were
not
to
be
received
by
her
and
she
put
them
aside
quite
as
though
she
had
been
according
to
her
own
opinion
above
rather
than
beneath
them
the
pretensions
of
shade
buckheath
a
man
dangerous
remorseless
as
careless
of
the
rights
of
others
as
any
tiger
in
the
jungle
she
regarded
with
negligent
composure
but
gray
stoddard
ah
there
her
treacherous
heart
gave
way
and
trembled
in
terror
the
air
of
perfect
equality
he
maintained
between
them
his
attitude
of
intimacy
flattering
almost
affectionate
this
it
was
which
she
felt
she
must
not
recognize
the
beloved
books
which
had
seemed
so
many
steps
upon
which
to
climb
to
a
world
where
she
dared
acknowledge
her
own
liking
and
admiration
for
stoddard
were
now
laid
aside
it
took
all
of
her
heart
and
mind
and
time
to
visit
uncle
pros
at
the
hospital
keep
the
children
out
of
way
in
the
house
and
do
justice
to
her
work
in
the
factory
she
told
gray
haltingly
reluctantly
that
she
thought
she
must
give
up
the
reading
and
studying
for
a
time
not
for
long
i
hope
stoddard
received
her
decision
with
a
puzzled
air
turning
in
his
fingers
the
copy
of
walden
which
she
was
bringing
back
to
him
perhaps
now
that
you
have
your
mother
and
the
children
with
you
there
will
be
less
time
for
this
sort
of
thing
for
a
while
but
you
have
a
mind
that
can
enjoy
being
inactive
you
may
think
you
give
it
up
but
study
once
you
tasted
it
will
never
let
you
alone
johnnie
looked
up
at
him
with
a
weak
and
pitiful
version
of
her
usual
beaming
smile
i
reckon
you
right
she
hesitated
finally
in
a
very
low
voice
but
sometimes
i
think
the
less
we
know
the
happier
we
are
how
this
how
this
cried
stoddard
almost
startled
why
johnnie
i
never
expected
to
hear
that
sort
of
thing
from
you
i
thought
your
optimism
was
as
deep
as
a
well
and
as
wide
as
a
church
poor
johnnie
surely
had
need
of
such
optimism
as
stoddard
had
ascribed
to
her
they
were
weary
evenings
when
she
came
home
now
with
the
november
rain
blowing
in
the
streets
and
the
dusk
almost
upon
her
it
was
on
a
saturday
night
and
she
had
been
to
the
hospital
when
she
got
in
to
find
mandy
seated
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
sitting
room
with
a
red
flannel
cloth
around
her
neck
a
sure
sign
that
something
unfortunate
had
occurred
since
the
tall
woman
always
had
sore
throat
when
trouble
loomed
large
what
the
matter
asked
johnnie
coming
close
and
laying
a
hand
on
the
bent
shoulder
to
peer
into
the
drooping
countenance
do
come
too
nigh
me
you
ketch
it
warned
mandy
gloomily
a
is
as
ketchin
as
smallpox
and
i
know
it
so
to
be
though
they
is
them
that
say
it
ai
when
mine
gits
like
this
i
jest
tie
it
up
and
keep
away
from
folks
best
i
can
i
hai
dared
touch
the
baby
sence
hit
began
to
hurt
me
this
there
something
besides
the
sore
throat
persisted
johnnie
is
it
anything
i
can
help
you
about
now
if
that
ai
jest
like
johnnie
consadine
apostrophized
mandy
yes
there
is
somethin
not
that
i
keer
she
tossed
her
poor
old
gray
head
scornfully
and
then
groaned
because
the
movement
hurt
her
throat
that
thar
feisty
old
sullivan
gave
me
my
time
this
evenin
he
said
they
was
layin
off
weavers
and
they
could
spare
me
i
told
him
well
i
could
spare
them
too
i
told
him
i
could
hire
in
any
other
mill
in
cottonville
befo
workin
time
monday
but
i
afeared
i
cai
weak
tears
began
to
travel
down
her
countenance
i
know
i
never
will
make
a
fine
hand
like
you
johnnie
she
said
pathetically
there
a
thing
in
the
mill
that
i
love
to
do
nary
thing
i
can
tend
a
truck
patch
or
raise
a
field
o
corn
to
beat
anybody
and
nobody
cai
outdo
me
with
fowls
but
the
mill
she
broke
off
and
sat
staring
dully
at
the
floor
pap
himes
had
stumped
into
the
room
during
the
latter
part
of
this
conversation
lost
your
job
hey
he
inquired
keenly
mandy
nodded
with
fearful
eyes
on
his
face
well

to
watch
out
and
keep
yo
board
paid
up
here

week

reckon
i
better
trouble
you
to
pay
me
in
advance
you
got
some
kind
friend
that
stand
for
you
mandy
lips
parted
but
no
sound
came
the
gaze
of
absolute
terror
with
which
she
followed
the
old
man
waddling
bulk
as
he
went
and
seated
himself
in
front
of
the
stove
was
more
than
johnnie
could
endure
i
stand
for
her
board
pap
she
said
quietly
oh
you
will
will
ye
pap
received
her
remark
with
disfavour
well
a
fool
and
his
money
do
stay
together
long
and
who

for
you
johnnie
consadine
yo
wages

for
yo

and
mandy
too
ye
need
lay
back
on
bein
my
stepdaughter
you
acted
square
by
me
an
i
do
aim
to

more
for

week

know
she

pap
an
experienced
weaver

for
her
himes
snorted
mandy
caught
at
johnnie
hand
and
drew
it
to
her
fondling
it
her
round
eyes
were
still
full
of
tears
i
do
know
you
the
sweetest
thing
god
ever
made
she
whispered
as
johnnie
looked
down
at
her
you
and
deanie
and
the
two
went
out
into
the
dining
room
together
thar
muttered
himes
to
buckheath
as
the
latter
passed
through
on
his
way
to
supper
you
see
whether
it
would
do
to
give
johnnie
the
o
all
that
thar
money
from
the
patent
why
she
hand
it
out
to
the
first
feller
that
put
up
a
poor
mouth
and
asked
her
for
it
you
heard
anything
buck
shade
nodded
come
down
to
the
works
with
me
after
supper
i
got
something
to
show
you
he
said
briefly
and
himes
understood
that
the
desired
letter
had
arrived
at
first
laurella
consadine
bloomed
like
a
late
rose
in
the
town
atmosphere
she
delighted
in
the
village
streets
she
was
as
wildly
exhilarated
as
a
child
when
she
was
taken
on
the
trolley
to
watauga
with
strange
inherent
deftness
she
copied
the
garb
the
hair
dressing
even
the
manner
and
speech
of
such
worthy
models
as
came
within
her
range
of
vision
like
her
daughter
she
had
an
eye
for
fitness
and
beauty
that
which
was
merely
fashionable
though
truly
inelegant
did
not
appeal
to
her
she
was
swift
to
appreciate
the
change
in
johnnie
you
look
a
heap
prettier
and
act
and
speak
a
heap
prettier
than
you
used
to
up
in
the
mountains
she
told
the
tall
girl
looks
like
it
was
a
mighty
sensible
thing
for
you
to
come
down
here
to
the
settlement
and
if
it
was
good
for
you
i
do
see
why
it
was
good
for
me
and
be
for
the
rest
of
the
children
no
need
for
you
to
be
so
solemn
over
it
the
entire
household
was
aghast
at
the
bride
attitude
toward
her
old
husband
they
watched
her
with
the
fascinated
gaze
we
give
to
a
petted
child
encroaching
upon
the
rights
of
a
cross
dog
or
the
pretty
lady
with
her
little
riding
whip
in
the
cage
of
the
lion
she
treated
him
with
a
kindly
tolerant
yet
overbearing
familiarity
that
appalled
she
knew
not
to
be
frightened
when
he
clicked
his
teeth
but
drew
up
her
pretty
brows
and
fretted
at
him
that
she
wished
he
would
make
that
noise
it
worried
her
she
tipped
the
sacred
yellow
cat
out
of
the
where
it
always
slept
in
state
took
the
chair
herself
and
sent
that
astonished
feline
from
the
room
it
was
in
laurella
evident
influence
that
johnnie
put
her
trust
when
one
evening
they
all
sat
in
sunday
leisure
in
the
front
room
most
of
the
girls
being
gone
to
church
or
out
strolling
with
company
pap
himes
broached
the
question
of
the
children
going
to
work
in
the
mill
they
too
young
pap
johnnie
said
to
him
mildly
they
ought
to
be
in
school
this
winter
they
every
one
down
to
deanie
had
mo
than
the
six
weeks
that
the
laws
calls
for
snarled
himes
you
was
thinking
of
putting
deanie
in
the
mill
not
was
you
asked
johnnie
breathlessly
why
not
inquired
himes
she
get
no
good
runnin
the
streets
here
in
cottonville
and
she
can
earn
a
little
somethin
in
the
mill
i
a
old
man
an
sickly
and
i
ai
long
for
this
world
if
them
chaps
is
to
do
anything
for
me
they
better
be
puttin
in
their
licks
johnnie
looked
from
the
little
girl
infantile
beauty
she
sat
with
the
child
in
her
lap
to
the
old
man
hulking
powerful
useless
frame
what
would
deanie
naturally
be
expected
to
do
for
her
stepfather
nobody
asked
my
opinion
observed
shade
buckheath
who
made
one
of
the
family
group
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
ai
a
thing
to
hurt
young
about
mill
work
and
there
surely
ai
any
good
reason
why
they
should
earn
their
way
same
as
we
all
do
i
reckon
they
had
to
work
back
on
unaka
goin
to
set
up
now
an
make
swells
of
johnnie
looked
bitterly
at
him
but
made
no
reply
they
wo
take
them
at
the
hardwick
mill
she
said
finally
stoddard
has
enforced
the
rule
that
they
have
to
have
an
affidavit
with
any
child
the
mill
employs
that
it
is
of
legal
age
and
there
nobody
going
to
swear
that
deanie
even
as
much
as
twelve
years
old
nor
lissy
nor
pony
nor
milo
the
oldest
is
but
eleven
laurella
had
bought
a
long
chain
of
red
glass
beads
with
a
pendant
this
trinket
occupied
her
attention
entirely
while
her
daughter
and
husband
discussed
the
matter
of
the
children
future
johnnie
she
began
now
apparently
not
having
heard
one
word
that
had
been
said
did
you
ever
in
your
life
see
anything
so
cheap
as
this
here
string
of
beads
for
a
dime
i
vow
i
could
live
and
die
in
that
store
at
watauga
there
was
more
pretties
in
it
than
i
could
have
looked
at
in
a
week
i
going
right
back
thar
monday
and
git
me
them
green
garters
that
the
gal
showed
me
i
do
know
what
i
was
thinkin
about
to
come
away
without
they
was
but
a
nickel
pap
himes
looked
at
her
at
the
beads
and
gave
the
fierce
inarticulate
ludicrously
futile
growl
of
a
thwarted
perplexed
animal
mother
appealed
johnnie
desperately
do
you
want
the
children
to
go
into
the
mill
i
do
know
but
they
might
as
well
for
a
spell
said
laurella
himes
vainly
endeavouring
to
look
and
to
pretend
that
she
was
really
the
head
of
the
family
they
want
to
go
and
you
done
mighty
well
in
the
mill
if
it
was
for
my
health
i
reckon
i
might
go
in
and
try
to
learn
to
weave
myself
but
there
i
came
with
mandy
evenin
when
she
was
out
and
the
noise
of
that
there
factory
is
enough
for
me
from
the
outside
i
never
could
stand
to
be
in
it
looks
like
such
a
racket
would
drive
me
plumb
crazy
pap
stared
at
his
bride
and
clicked
his
teeth
with
the
gnashing
sound
that
overawed
the
others
he
drew
his
shaggy
brows
in
an
attempt
to
look
masterful
well
ef
you
cai
tend
looms
i
reckon
you
can
take
mavity
place
in
the
house
here
and
let
her
keep
to
the
weavin
stiddier
she
just
about
lose
her
job
if
she
has
to
be
out
and
in
so
much
as
she
has
had
to
be
with
me
here
of
late
i
will
when
i
can
said
laurella
patronizingly
sometimes
i
get
to
feeling
just
kind
of
restless
and
and
ca
do
a
stroke
of
work
when
i
i
go
to
bed
and
sleep
it
off
or
get
out
and
go
somewheres
that
take
my
mind
from
my
troubles
hit
by
far
the
best
way
once
more
pap
looked
at
her
and
opened
and
shut
his
mouth
helplessly
then
he
turned
sullenly
to
his
stepdaughter
grumbling
you
hear
that
she
wo
work
and
you
wo
give
me
your
money
the
children
have
obliged
to
bring
in
a
little
something
that
the
way
it
looks
to
me
if
the
mills
on
the
tennessee
side
is
too
choicy
to
take
and
i
know
well
as
you
johnnie
that
they
air
their
man
connors
told
me
so
i
can
hire
over
at
the
victory
on
the
georgy
side
the
victory
a
mill
notorious
in
the
district
for
its
ancient
unsanitary
buildings
its
poor
management
its
bad
treatment
of
its
hands
yes
it
was
true
that
at
the
victory
you
could
hire
out
anything
that
could
walk
and
talk
johnnie
caught
her
breath
and
hugged
the
small
pliant
body
to
her
breast
feeling
with
a
mighty
throb
of
fierce
the
poor
little
ribs
yet
cartilagenous
the
delicate
soft
frame
for
which
god
and
nature
demanded
time
and
chance
to
grow
and
strengthen
yet
she
knew
if
she
gave
up
her
wages
to
pap
she
would
be
no
better
off
indeed
she
would
be
helpless
in
his
hands
and
the
sum
of
them
would
not
cover
what
the
children
all
together
could
earn
oh
lord
to
work
in
the
victory
she
groaned
now
johnnie
objected
her
mother
do
you
get
meddlesome
just
because
you
a
old
maid
your
betsy
was
meddlesome
disposed
i
reckon
single
women
as
they
get
on
in
years
is
apt
so
to
be
every
one
of
these
children
has
been
promised
that
they
should
be
let
to
work
in
the
mill
they
been
jest
honin
to
do
it
ever
since
you
came
down
and
got
your
place
deanie
was
scared
to
death
for
fear
they
would
take
her
do
you
be
meddlesome
yes
and
i
goin
to
buy
me
a
gun
and
a
nag
with
my
money
what
i
earn
put
in
pony
explosively
i
take
to
ride
he
added
the
saving
clause
under
milo
reproving
eye
sis
johnnie
you
want
me
to
earn
money
and
buy
a
hawse
and
a
gun
and
a
and
most
else
johnnie
looked
down
into
the
blue
eyes
of
the
little
lad
who
had
crept
close
to
her
chair
what
he
would
earn
in
the
factory
she
knew
well
blows
curses
evil
knowledge
if
they
should
go
to
the
victory
i
be
mighty
proud
to
do
all
i
could
to
look
after
johnnie
spoke
mandy
from
the
shadows
where
she
sat
on
the
floor
at
laurella
consadine
feet
working
away
with
a
and
cloth
at
the
cleaning
and
polishing
of
the
little
tan
footwear
ye
know
i
looms
thar
mornin
yes
i
am
in
answer
to
johnnie
deprecating
look
i
ruther
do
it
as
to
run
round
a
week
or
a
month
the
better
ones
huntin
a
job
and
you
here
standin
for
my
board
till
late
that
night
johnnie
laboured
with
her
mother
and
stepfather
trying
to
show
them
that
the
mill
was
no
fit
place
for
the
children
milo
was
all
too
apt
for
such
a
situation
the
very
material
out
of
which
a
cotton
mill
moulds
its
best
hands
and
its
worst
citizens
pony
restless
emotional
gifted
and
ambitious
craving
his
share
of
the
joy
of
life
and
its
opportunities
would
never
make
a
mill
hand
but
under
the
pressure
of
factory
life
his
sister
apprehended
that
he
would
make
a
criminal
agreed
pap
drily
when
she
tried
to
put
something
of
this
into
words
i
spotted
that
feller
for
a
rogue
and
a
shirk
the
minute
i
laid
eyes
on
him
the
mill
tame
him
the
mill
make
him
git
down
and
pull
in
the
collar
i
reckon
women
ai
fitten
to
bring
up
chillen
a
widder
boys
allers
goes
to
ruin
why
johnnie
consadine
every
one
of
them
chaps
is
plumb
crazy
to
work
in
the
mill
just
like
you
was
and
you
workin
in
the
mill
yourself
what
makes
you
talk
so
foolish
about
it
laurella
nodded
an
agreement
looking
more
than
usually
like
a
little
girl
playing
dolls
i
reckon
himes
knows
best
johnnie
honey
was
her
reiterated
comment
cautiously
johnnie
approached
the
subject
of
pay
her
stepfather
had
already
demanded
her
wages
and
expressed
unbounded
surprise
that
she
was
not
willing
to
pass
over
the
saturday
to
him
and
let
him
put
the
money
in
the
bank
along
with
his
other
savings
careful
calculation
showed
that
the
four
children
could
after
a
few
weeks
of
learning
probably
earn
a
little
more
than
she
could
and
in
any
case
himes
put
it
as
a
disciplinary
measure
a
way
of
life
selected
largely
for
the
good
of
the
little
ones
if
you
just
as
soon
let
me
she
said
to
him
at
last
i
believe
take
them
over
to
the
victory
myself
morning
she
had
hopes
of
telling
their
ages
bluntly
to
the
mill
superintendent
and
having
them
refused
pap
agreed
negligently
he
had
no
liking
for
early
rising
and
thus
it
was
that
johnnie
found
herself
at
eight
making
her
way
in
the
midst
of
the
little
group
toward
the
georgia
line
and
the
old
victory
plant
which
all
good
workers
in
the
district
shunned
if
possible
as
she
set
her
foot
on
the
first
plank
of
the
bridge
she
heard
a
little
rumble
of
sound
and
down
the
road
came
a
light
vehicle
with
coloured
driver
and
miss
lydia
sessions
taking
her
children
out
for
an
early
morning
drive
there
was
a
frail
boy
of
ten
sitting
beside
his
aunt
in
the
back
with
a
girl
of
eight
tucked
between
them
the
nurse
on
the
front
seat
held
the
youngest
child
a
little
girl
about
deanie
age
as
they
came
nearer
the
driver
drew
up
evidently
in
obedience
to
miss
sessions
command
and
she
leaned
forward
graciously
to
speak
to
johnnie
good
morning
john
said
miss
sessions
as
the
carriage
stopped
whose
children
are
those
they
are
my
little
sisters
and
brothers
responded
johnnie
looking
down
with
a
very
pale
face
and
busying
herself
with
deanie
hair
and
you
taking
them
over
to
the
mill
so
that
they
can
learn
to
be
useful
how
nice
that
is
lydia
smiled
brightly
at
the
little
ones
her
best
smile
no
returned
johnnie
goaded
past
endurance
i
going
over
to
see
if
i
can
get
them
to
refuse
to
take
this
one
and
she
bent
and
picked
deanie
up
holding
her
the
child
head
dropped
shyly
against
her
breast
the
small
face
turned
a
bit
so
that
one
blue
eye
might
investigate
the
carriage
and
those
in
it
deanie
too
little
to
work
in
the
mill
johnnie
went
on
they
have
night
turn
over
there
at
the
victory
now
and
it
just
about
make
her
sick
miss
lydia
frowned
oh
john
i
think
you
are
mistaken
she
said
coldly
the
work
is
very
light
you
know
that
young
people
work
a
great
deal
harder
racing
about
in
their
play
than
at
anything
they
have
to
do
in
a
spooling
room
sure
my
nieces
and
nephews
do
and
in
your
case
it
is
necessary
and
right
that
the
younger
members
of
the
family
should
help
i
think
you
will
find
that
it
will
not
hurt
them
individuals
who
work
in
cotton
mills
and
are
not
adults
are
never
alluded
to
as
children
it
is
an
offense
to
mention
them
so
they
are
always
spoken
of
even
those
scarcely
more
than
three
feet
high
as
young
people
miss
sessions
had
smiled
upon
the
piteous
little
group
with
a
judicious
mixture
of
patronage
and
mild
reproof
and
her
driver
had
shaken
the
lines
over
the
backs
of
the
fat
horses
preparatory
to
moving
on
when
stoddard
car
turned
into
the
street
from
the
corner
above
wait
junius
dick
is
afraid
of
autos
cautioned
miss
lydia
nervously
junius
grinned
respectfully
while
bay
dick
dozed
and
regarded
the
approaching
car
philosophically
as
they
stood
they
blocked
the
way
so
that
gray
was
obliged
to
slow
down
and
finally
to
stop
he
raised
his
hat
ceremoniously
to
both
groups
his
pained
eyes
went
past
lydia
sessions
as
though
she
had
been
but
the
painted
representation
of
a
woman
to
fasten
themselves
on
johnnie
where
she
stood
her
tall
figure
relieved
against
the
shining
water
the
child
on
her
breast
the
little
ones
huddled
about
her
that
johnnie
consadine
should
have
fallen
away
all
at
once
from
that
higher
course
she
had
so
eagerly
chosen
and
so
resolutely
maintained
had
been
to
gray
a
disappointment
whose
depth
and
bitterness
somewhat
surprised
him
in
vain
he
recalled
the
fact
that
all
his
theories
of
life
were
against
forcing
a
culture
where
none
was
desired
he
went
back
to
it
with
grief
he
had
been
so
sure
that
johnnie
did
love
the
real
things
that
hers
was
a
nature
which
not
only
wished
but
must
have
spiritual
and
mental
food
her
attitude
toward
himself
upon
their
few
meetings
of
late
had
confirmed
a
certain
distrust
of
her
if
one
may
use
so
strong
a
word
she
seemed
afraid
almost
ashamed
to
face
him
what
was
it
she
was
doing
he
wondered
that
she
knew
so
perfectly
he
would
disapprove
and
then
with
the
return
of
the
books
the
dropping
of
johnnie
education
came
the
abrupt
end
of
those
informal
letters
not
till
they
ceased
did
he
realize
how
large
a
figure
they
had
come
to
cut
in
his
life
only
this
morning
he
had
taken
them
out
and
read
them
over
and
decided
that
the
girl
who
wrote
them
was
worth
at
least
an
attempt
toward
an
explanation
and
better
footing
he
had
decided
not
to
give
her
up
now
she
confirmed
his
worst
apprehensions
at
his
glance
her
face
was
suffused
with
a
swift
distressed
red
she
wondered
if
he
yet
knew
of
her
mother
marriage
she
dreaded
the
time
when
she
must
tell
him
with
an
inarticulate
murmur
she
spoke
to
the
little
ones
turned
her
back
and
hurried
across
the
bridge
is
johnnie
putting
those
children
in
the
mill
asked
stoddard
half
doubtfully
as
his
gaze
followed
them
toward
the
entrance
of
the
victory
i
believe
so
returned
lydia
smiling
we
were
just
speaking
of
how
good
it
was
that
the
cotton
mills
gave
an
opportunity
for
even
the
smaller
ones
to
help
at
work
which
is
within
their
capacity
johnnie
consadine
said
that
inquired
gray
startled
why
is
she
taking
them
over
to
the
victory
and
then
he
answered
his
own
question
she
knows
very
well
they
are
below
the
legal
age
in
tennessee
lydia
sessions
trimmed
instantly
that
must
be
it
she
said
i
wondered
a
little
that
she
seemed
not
to
want
them
in
the
same
factory
that
she
is
in
but
i
remember
brother
hartley
said
that
we
are
very
particular
at
our
mill
to
hire
no
young
people
below
the
legal
age
that
must
be
it
stoddard
looked
with
reprehending
yet
still
incredulous
eyes
to
where
johnnie
and
her
small
following
disappeared
within
the
mill
doors
johnnie
the
girl
who
had
written
him
that
pathetic
little
letter
about
the
children
in
her
room
and
her
growing
doubt
as
to
the
wholesomeness
of
their
work
the
girl
who
had
read
the
books
he
gave
her
and
fed
her
understanding
on
them
till
she
expressed
herself
logically
and
lucidly
on
the
economic
problems
of
the
day
that
for
the
sake
of
the
few
cents
they
could
earn
she
should
put
the
children
whom
he
knew
she
loved
into
slavery
seemed
to
him
monstrous
beyond
belief
why
if
this
were
true
what
a
hypocrite
the
girl
was
as
coarse
and
unfeeling
as
the
rest
of
them
yet
she
had
some
shame
left
she
had
blushed
to
be
caught
in
the
act
by
him
it
showed
her
worse
than
those
who
justified
this
thing
the
enormity
of
which
she
had
seemed
to
understand
well
you
must
blame
her
too
much
came
lydia
sessions
smooth
voice
john
mother
is
a
widow
and
girls
of
that
age
like
pretty
clothes
and
a
good
time
some
people
consider
john
very
handsome
and
of
course
with
an
ignorant
young
woman
of
that
class
flattery
is
likely
to
turn
the
head
i
think
she
does
as
well
as
could
be
expected
chapter
xvi
bitter
waters
johnnie
had
a
set
of
small
volumes
of
english
verse
extensively
annotated
by
his
own
hand
which
stoddard
had
brought
to
her
early
in
their
acquaintance
leaving
it
with
her
more
as
a
gift
than
as
a
loan
she
kept
these
little
books
after
all
the
others
had
gone
back
she
had
read
and
reread
them
cullings
from
chaucer
from
spenser
from
the
elizabethan
lyrists
the
border
balladry
fierce
tender
oh
so
human
till
she
knew
pages
of
them
by
heart
and
their
vocabulary
influenced
her
own
their
imagery
tinged
all
her
leisure
thoughts
it
seemed
to
her
whenever
she
debated
returning
them
that
she
could
not
bear
it
she
would
get
them
out
and
sit
with
one
of
them
open
in
her
hands
not
reading
but
staring
at
the
pages
with
unseeing
eyes
passing
her
fingers
over
it
as
one
strokes
a
beloved
hand
or
turning
through
each
book
only
to
find
the
pencilled
words
in
the
margins
she
would
be
giving
up
part
of
herself
when
she
took
these
back
yet
it
had
to
be
done
and
one
miserable
morning
she
made
them
all
into
a
neat
package
intending
to
carry
them
to
the
mill
and
place
them
on
stoddard
desk
thus
early
when
nobody
would
be
in
the
office
then
the
children
came
in
deanie
was
half
sick
and
in
the
distress
of
getting
the
ailing
child
comfortably
into
her
own
bed
johnnie
forgot
the
books
taking
them
in
at
noon
she
met
stoddard
himself
i
brought
you
back
your
those
little
books
of
old
english
poetry
she
said
with
a
sudden
constriction
in
her
throat
and
a
quick
burning
flush
that
suffused
brow
cheek
and
neck
stoddard
looked
at
her
she
was
thinner
than
she
had
been
and
otherwise
showed
the
marks
of
misery
and
of
factory
life
the
sight
was
almost
intolerable
to
him
poor
girl
she
herself
was
suffering
cruelly
enough
beneath
the
same
yoke
she
had
helped
to
lay
on
the
children
are
you
really
giving
up
your
studies
entirely
he
asked
in
what
he
tried
to
make
a
very
kindly
voice
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
package
of
books
i
wonder
if
you
are
making
a
mistake
johnnie
you
look
as
though
you
were
working
too
hard
some
things
are
worth
more
than
money
and
getting
on
in
the
world
johnnie
shook
her
head
for
the
moment
words
were
beyond
her
then
she
managed
to
say
in
a
fairly
composed
tone
there
is
any
other
way
for
me
i
think
some
times
stoddard
when
a
body
is
born
to
a
hard
life
all
the
struggling
and
trying
just
makes
it
that
much
harder
maybe
when
the
children
get
a
little
older
i
have
more
chance
the
statement
was
wistfully
timidly
made
yet
to
gray
stoddard
it
seemed
a
brazen
defence
of
her
present
course
it
pierced
him
that
she
on
whose
nobility
of
nature
he
could
have
staked
his
life
should
justify
such
action
yes
he
said
with
quick
bitterness
they
might
be
able
to
earn
more
of
course
as
time
goes
on
it
was
a
cruel
speech
between
two
people
who
had
discussed
this
feature
of
industrial
life
as
these
had
even
stoddard
had
no
idea
how
cruel
for
a
dizzy
moment
the
girl
stared
at
him
then
though
her
flushed
cheeks
had
whitened
pitifully
and
her
lip
trembled
she
answered
with
bravely
lifted
head
i
thank
you
very
much
for
all
the
help
you
been
to
me
stoddard
what
i
said
just
now
did
look
as
though
i
appreciated
it
i
ask
your
pardon
for
that
i
aim
to
do
the
best
i
can
for
the
children
and
i
thank
you
she
turned
and
was
gone
leaving
him
puzzled
and
with
a
sore
ache
at
heart
winter
came
on
wet
dark
cheerless
in
the
shackling
little
village
and
johnnie
saw
for
the
first
time
what
the
distress
of
the
poor
in
cities
is
a
temperature
which
would
have
been
agreeable
in
a
drier
climate
bit
to
the
bone
in
the
valleys
of
that
mountain
region
the
houses
were
mostly
mere
board
shanties
tightened
by
pasting
newspapers
over
the
cracks
inside
where
the
women
of
the
family
had
time
for
such
work
and
the
heating
apparatus
was
generally
a
with
possibly
an
additional
coal
heater
in
the
front
room
which
could
be
fired
on
sundays
or
when
the
family
was
at
home
to
tend
it
all
through
the
bright
autumn
days
laurella
himes
had
hurried
from
one
new
and
charming
sensation
or
discovery
to
another
she
was
like
the
butterflies
that
haunt
the
banks
of
little
streams
or
wayside
pools
at
this
season
disporting
themselves
more
gaily
even
than
the
insects
of
spring
in
what
must
be
at
best
a
briefer
glory
when
the
weather
began
to
be
chilly
she
complained
of
a
pain
in
her
side
hit
hurts
me
right
there
she
would
say
piteously
taking
hand
and
laying
it
over
the
left
side
of
her
chest
my
feet
been
good
and
warm
since
the
weather
turned
i
jest
cai
stand
these
here
old
black
boxes
of
stoves
they
have
in
the
settlement
if
i
could
oncet
lay
down
on
the
big
hearth
at
home
and
get
my
feet
warm
i
jest
know
my
misery
would
leave
me
at
first
pap
merely
grunted
over
these
homesick
repinings
but
after
a
time
he
began
to
hang
about
her
and
offer
counsel
which
was
often
enough
peevishly
received
no
i
ai
et
anything
that
disagreed
with
me
laurella
pettishly
replied
to
his
inquiries
you
thinkin
about
i
never
eat
more
than
is
good
for
me
nor
anything
that
ai
jest
right
hit
ai
my
stomach
hit
right
there
in
my
side
looks
like
hit
was
my
heart
an
i
believe
in
my
soul
it
is
oh
law
if
i
could
oncet
lay
down
befo
a
nice
good
hickory
fire
and
get
my
feet
warm
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
while
everybody
in
the
looked
on
amazed
almost
aghast
gideon
himes
withdrew
from
the
bank
such
money
as
was
necessary
and
had
a
chimney
built
at
the
side
of
the
fore
room
and
a
broad
hearth
laid
he
begged
almost
tearfully
for
a
small
grate
which
should
burn
the
soft
bituminous
coal
of
the
region
and
be
much
cheaper
to
install
and
maintain
but
laurella
turned
away
from
these
suggestions
with
the
hopeless
pliable
obstinacy
of
the
weak
i
would
give
the
rappin
o
my
finger
for
a
nasty
little
smudgy
smoky
grate
fire
she
declared
rebelliously
thanklessly
a
hickory
is
what
i
want
and
if
i
cai
have
that
i
reckon
i
can
jest
die
without
it
now
laurelly
now
laurelly
pap
quavered
in
tones
none
other
had
ever
heard
from
him
do
you
talk
about
dyin
you
look
as
young
as
johnnie
this
minute
i
git
you
what
you
want
lord
i
have
dawson
build
the
chimbley
big
enough
for
you
to
keep
house
in
if
yo
ruthers
it
was
almost
large
enough
for
that
and
the
great
load
of
hickory
logs
which
himes
hauled
into
the
yard
from
the
neighbouring
was
cut
to
length
fire
was
kindled
in
the
new
chimney
it
drew
perfectly
and
pap
himself
carried
laurella
in
his
arms
and
laid
her
on
some
quilts
beside
the
hearthstone
demanding
eagerly
thar
now
do
that
make
you
feel
better
the
ailing
woman
turned
restlessly
on
her
pallet
the
big
awkward
old
man
stood
with
his
disproportionately
long
arms
hanging
by
his
sides
staring
at
her
unaware
that
his
presence
half
undid
the
good
the
leaping
flames
were
doing
her
i
uncle
pros
was
sitting
right
over
there
side
the
fire
murmured
laurella
dreamily
how
is
pros
johnnie
for
nobody
understood
as
the
crazed
man
in
the
hospital
might
have
done
that
laurella
bodily
illness
was
but
the
cosmic
despair
of
the
little
girl
who
has
broken
her
doll
it
had
been
the
philosophy
of
this
butterfly
nature
to
turn
her
back
on
things
when
they
got
too
bad
and
take
to
her
bed
till
in
the
course
of
events
they
bettered
themselves
but
now
she
had
emerged
into
a
bleak
winter
world
where
uncle
pros
was
not
where
johnnie
was
powerless
and
where
she
had
been
allowed
by
an
unkind
providence
to
work
havoc
with
her
own
life
and
the
lives
of
her
little
ones
and
her
illness
was
as
the
tears
of
the
girl
with
a
shattered
toy
the
children
in
their
broken
shoes
and
thin
clothing
shivered
on
the
roads
between
house
and
mill
and
gave
colour
to
the
statement
of
many
employers
that
they
were
better
off
in
the
thoroughly
warmed
factories
than
at
home
but
the
factories
were
a
little
too
thoroughly
warmed
the
operatives
sweated
under
their
tasks
and
left
the
rooms
with
their
temperature
of
to
come
drenched
with
perspiration
into
the
chill
outside
air
the
colds
which
resulted
were
always
supposed
to
be
caught
out
of
doors
nobody
had
sufficient
understanding
of
such
matters
to
suggest
that
the
rebreathed
superheated
atmosphere
of
the
mill
room
was
responsible
deanie
who
had
never
been
sick
a
day
in
her
life
took
a
heavy
cold
and
coughed
so
that
she
could
scarcely
get
any
sleep
johnnie
was
desperately
anxious
since
the
lint
of
the
spinning
room
immediately
irritated
the
little
throat
and
perpetuated
the
cold
in
a
steady
hacking
cough
that
workers
know
well
pony
was
from
the
first
insubordinate
and
incorrigible
in
short
he
died
hard
he
came
to
johnnie
again
and
again
with
stories
of
having
been
cursed
and
struck
she
could
only
beg
him
to
be
good
and
do
what
was
demanded
without
laying
himself
liable
to
punishment
milo
the
little
burden
bearer
was
growing
fast
and
lacked
stamina
beneath
the
régime
his
chest
was
getting
dreadfully
hollow
he
was
all
too
good
a
worker
and
tried
anxiously
to
make
up
for
his
shortcomings
pony
he
a
little
feller
milo
would
say
pitifully
he
ai
nigh
as
old
as
i
am
it
comes
easier
to
me
than
what
it
does
to
him
to
stay
in
the
house
and
tend
my
frames
and
do
like
i
told
if
the
bosses
would
call
me
when
he
do
do
to
suit
i
could
always
get
him
to
mind
lissy
had
something
of
her
mother
shining
vitality
but
it
dimmed
woefully
in
the
clatter
and
slam
of
the
big
victory
mill
the
children
had
come
from
the
sunlit
heights
and
free
air
of
the
unakas
their
play
had
been
always
out
of
doors
on
the
mosses
under
tall
trees
where
fragrant
balsams
dropped
cushions
of
springy
needles
for
the
feet
their
labour
the
gathering
of
brush
and
chips
for
the
fire
in
winter
the
dropping
corn
and
with
the
older
boys
the
hoeing
of
it
in
spring
and
summer
all
under
god
open
sky
they
had
been
forced
into
the
factory
when
nothing
but
places
on
the
night
shift
could
be
got
for
them
day
work
was
promised
later
but
the
bitter
winter
wore
away
and
still
the
little
captives
crept
over
the
bridge
in
the
twilight
and
slunk
shivering
home
at
dawn
johnnie
made
an
arrangement
to
get
off
from
her
work
a
little
earlier
and
used
to
take
the
two
girls
over
herself
but
she
could
not
go
for
them
in
the
morning
one
evening
about
the
holidays
miserably
wet
and
offering
its
squalid
contrast
to
the
season
johnnie
plodding
along
between
the
two
little
girls
with
pony
and
milo
following
met
gray
stoddard
face
to
face
he
halted
uncertainly
there
was
a
world
of
reproach
in
his
face
and
johnnie
answered
it
with
eyes
of
such
shame
and
contrition
as
convinced
him
that
she
knew
well
the
degradation
of
what
she
was
doing
you
need
another
umbrella
he
said
abruptly
putting
down
his
own
as
he
paused
under
the
store
porch
where
a
boy
stood
at
the
curb
with
his
car
hood
on
prepared
for
a
trip
in
to
watauga
i
lost
ventured
pony
it
do
seem
fair
that
milo
has
to
get
wet
because
i
so
bad
about
losing
things
does
it
and
he
smiled
engagingly
up
into
the
tall
man
face
johnnie
own
eyes
full
of
laughter
in
their
clear
depths
gray
stoddard
stared
down
at
them
silently
for
a
moment
then
he
pushed
the
handle
of
his
umbrella
into
the
boy
grimy
little
hand
see
how
long
you
can
keep
that
one
he
said
kindly
it
marked
on
the
handle
with
my
name
and
maybe
if
you
lost
it
somebody
might
bring
it
back
to
you
johnnie
had
turned
away
and
faltered
on
a
few
paces
in
a
daze
of
humiliation
and
misery
sis
johnnie
oh
sis
johnnie
pony
called
after
her
flourishing
the
umbrella
look
what
stoddard
give
milo
and
me
then
in
sudden
consternation
as
milo
caught
his
elbow
he
whirled
and
offered
voluble
thanks
i
a
goin
to
earn
a
whole
lot
of
money
and
pay
back
the
trouble
i
am
to
my
folks
he
confided
to
gray
hastily
i
did
know
i
was
such
a
bad
feller
till
i
came
down
to
the
settlement
looks
like
i
cai
noways

to

an
buy
things
for
milo
an
maw
an
the
girls
only
now
they
take
all
i
can
earn
away
from
me
there
was
a
warning
call
from
johnnie
ahead
in
the
dusk
somewhere
and
the
little
fellow
scuttled
away
toward
the
victory
and
a
night
of
work
spring
came
late
that
year
and
after
it
had
given
a
hint
of
relieving
the
misery
of
the
poor
there
followed
an
easter
storm
which
covered
all
the
gardens
with
sleet
and
sent
people
shivering
back
to
their
winter
wear
deanie
had
been
growing
very
thin
and
the
red
on
her
cheeks
was
a
round
spot
of
scarlet
laurella
lay
all
day
and
far
into
the
night
on
her
pallet
of
quilts
before
the
big
fire
in
the
front
room
spent
inert
staring
at
the
ceiling
entertaining
god
knows
what
guests
of
terror
and
remorse
nothing
distressing
must
be
brought
to
her
coming
home
from
work
once
at
dusk
johnnie
found
the
two
little
girls
on
the
porch
deanie
crying
and
lissy
trying
to
comfort
her
i
thest
cai
go
to
that
old
mill
sis
johnnie
the
little
one
pleaded
looks
like
i
thest
cai
i
could
tell
reardon
and
he
put
a
substitute
on
to
tend
her
frames
lissy
spoke
up
eagerly
you
ask
pap
himes
will
he
let
us
do
that
sis
johnnie
johnnie
went
past
her
mother
who
appeared
to
be
dozing
and
into
the
dining
room
where
himes
was
he
had
promised
to
do
some
night
work
setting
up
new
machines
at
the
victory
and
he
was
in
that
uncertain
humour
which
the
prospect
of
work
always
produced
gideon
himes
was
an
old
man
pestered
as
he
himself
would
have
put
it
by
the
mysterious
illness
of
his
young
wife
fretted
by
the
presence
of
the
children
no
doubt
in
a
measure
because
he
felt
himself
to
be
doing
an
ill
part
by
them
his
grumpy
silence
of
other
days
his
sardonic
humour
gave
place
to
hypochondriac
complainings
and
outbursts
of
fierce
temper
pony
had
hurt
his
foot
in
a
machine
at
the
factory
and
it
required
daily
dressing
johnnie
understood
from
the
sounds
which
greeted
her
that
the
sore
foot
was
being
bandaged
hold
still
cai
ye
growled
himes
i
ai
ye
now
you
set
in
to
bawl
and
i
give
ye
somethin
to
bawl
for
hear
me
the
old
man
was
skilful
with
hurts
but
he
was
using
such
unnecessary
roughness
in
this
case
as
set
the
plucky
little
chap
to
sobbing
and
just
as
johnnie
entered
the
room
got
him
punishment
for
it
it
was
an
unfortunate
time
to
bring
up
the
question
of
deanie
yet
it
must
be
settled
at
once
pap
said
the
girl
urgently
the
baby
ai
fit
to
go
to
the
mill
if
ever
she
ought
you
said
that
you
get
day
work
for
them
all
if
you
wo
do
that
let
deanie
stay
home
for
a
spell
she
sure
enough
is
fit
to
work
himes
faced
his
stepdaughter
angrily
when
i
say
a
child
fitten
to
work
it
fitten
to
work
he
rounded
on
her
i
hai
axed
your
opinion

then
keep
it
to
yourself
till
it
is
axed
for
you
pony
your
foot
done
and
ready
you
get
yourself
off
to
the
mill
or
you
be
docked
for
lost
time
the
little
fellow
limped
sniffling
out
johnnie
reached
down
for
deanie
who
had
crept
after
her
to
hear
how
her
cause
went
it
was
evident
that
sight
of
the
child
lingering
increased
pap
anger
yet
the
elder
sister
gathered
up
the
ailing
little
one
in
her
strong
arms
and
tried
again
pap
i
pay
you
for
deanie
whole
week
work
if
you
just
let
her
stay
home
i
pay
you
the
money
now
all
right
pap
stuck
out
a
ready
stubbed
palm
and
received
in
it
the
silver
that
was
the
price
of
the
little
girl
time
for
a
week
he
counted
it
over
before
he
rammed
it
down
in
his
pocket
then
you
can
pay
me
and
she
can
go
to
the
mill
your
wages
ought
to
come
to
me
anyhow
and
it
do
do
chaps
like
her

good
to
be
muchin
all
the
time
would
you
ruther
have
her
go
before
i
give
her
a
good
beatin
or
after
and
he
looked
johnnie
fiercely
in
the
eyes
johnnie
looked
back
at
him
unflinching
she
did
not
lack
spirit
to
defy
him
but
her
mother
was
this
man
wife
the
children
were
in
their
hands
devoted
as
she
was
she
saw
no
way
here
to
fight
for
the
little
ones
to
her
mother
she
could
not
appeal
she
must
have
support
from
outside
never
you
mind
honey
she
choked
as
she
clasped
deanie
thin
little
form
closer
and
the
meagre
small
arms
went
round
her
neck
find
a
way
you
go
on
to
the
mill
and
sister
find
somebody
to
help
her
and
she
come
there
and
get
you
before
morning
when
the
pitiful
little
figure
had
lagged
away
down
the
twilight
street
holding
to
lissy
hand
limping
on
sore
feet
johnnie
stood
long
on
the
porch
in
the
dark
with
gusts
of
rain
beating
intermittently
at
the
lattice
beside
her
her
hands
were
wrung
hard
together
her
desperate
gaze
roved
over
the
few
scattered
lights
of
the
little
village
over
the
great
flaring
throbbing
mills
beyond
as
though
questioning
where
she
could
seek
for
assistance
paying
money
to
pap
himes
did
no
good
so
much
was
plain
she
had
always
been
afraid
to
begin
it
and
she
realized
now
that
the
present
outcome
was
what
she
had
apprehended
uncle
pros
the
source
of
wisdom
for
all
her
childish
days
was
in
the
hospital
a
harmless
lunatic
of
late
the
old
man
bodily
health
had
mended
suddenly
almost
marvellously
but
he
remained
vacant
childish
in
mind
and
so
far
the
authorities
had
retained
him
hoping
to
probe
in
some
way
to
the
obscure
moving
cause
of
his
malady
twice
when
she
spoke
to
her
mother
of
late
being
very
desperate
laurella
had
said
peevishly
that
if
she
were
able
she
get
up
and
leave
the
house
plainly
she
was
too
sick
a
woman
to
be
troubled
as
johnnie
stood
there
shade
buckheath
passed
her
going
out
of
the
house
and
down
the
street
toward
the
store
once
she
might
have
thought
of
appealing
to
him
but
now
a
sure
knowledge
of
what
his
reply
would
be
forestalled
that
there
remained
then
what
the
others
called
her
swell
friends
gray
stoddard
the
thought
brought
with
it
an
agony
from
which
she
flinched
but
after
all
there
was
lydia
sessions
she
was
sure
miss
sessions
meant
to
be
kind
and
if
she
knew
that
deanie
was
really
sick
yes
it
would
be
worth
while
to
go
to
her
with
the
whole
matter
at
the
thought
she
turned
hesitatingly
toward
the
door
meaning
to
get
her
hat
and
though
she
had
formulated
no
method
of
appeal
to
hurry
to
the
hardwick
house
and
at
least
talk
with
miss
sessions
and
endeavour
to
enlist
her
help
but
the
door
opened
before
she
reached
it
and
mavity
bence
stood
there
in
her
face
the
deadly
weariness
of
all
woman
toil
and
travail
since
the
fall
johnnie
moved
to
her
quickly
putting
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
remembering
with
swift
compunction
that
the
poor
woman
burdens
were
trebled
since
laurella
lay
ill
and
pap
gave
up
so
much
of
his
time
to
hanging
anxiously
about
his
young
wife
what
is
it
aunt
mavity
she
asked
is
anything
the
matter
i
hate
to
werry
ye
johnnie
said
the
other
deprecating
voice
but
looks
like
i
jest
got
obliged
to
have
a
little
help
this
evenin
plumb
dead
on
my
feet
and
there
all
the
dishes
to
do
and
a
stack
of
towels
and
things
to
rub
out
her
dim
gaze
questioned
the
young
face
above
her
dubiously
almost
desperately
the
little
brass
lamp
in
her
hand
made
a
pitiful
wavering
of
course
i
can
help
you
i
have
been
in
before
this
only
i
i
was
kind
of
worried
about
something
else
and
i
forgot
declared
johnnie
strengthening
her
heart
to
endure
the
necessary
postponement
of
her
purpose
she
went
into
the
kitchen
with
mavity
bence
and
the
two
women
worked
there
at
the
dishes
and
washing
out
the
towels
till
after
nine
johnnie
anxiety
and
distress
mounting
with
every
minute
of
delay
at
a
little
past
nine
she
left
poor
mavity
at
the
door
of
that
wretched
place
the
poor
woman
called
her
room
looked
quietly
in
to
see
that
her
mother
seemed
to
sleep
got
her
hat
and
hurried
out
goaded
by
a
seemingly
disproportionate
fever
of
impatience
and
anxiety
she
took
her
way
up
the
little
hill
and
across
the
slope
to
where
the
hardwick
mansion
gleamed
gay
with
lights
behind
its
evergreens
when
she
reached
the
house
itself
she
found
an
evening
reception
going
forward
the
hardwicks
were
entertaining
the
lyric
club
she
halted
outside
debating
what
to
do
could
she
call
miss
lydia
from
her
company
to
listen
to
such
a
story
as
this
was
it
not
in
itself
almost
an
offence
to
bring
these
things
before
people
who
could
live
as
miss
lydia
lived
somebody
was
playing
the
violin
and
johnnie
drew
nearer
the
window
to
listen
she
stared
in
at
the
beautiful
lighted
room
the
happy
people
suddenly
she
caught
sight
of
gray
stoddard
standing
near
the
girl
who
was
playing
a
watchful
eye
upon
her
music
to
turn
it
for
her
she
clutched
the
and
stood
choking
and
blinded
fighting
with
a
crowd
of
daunting
recollections
and
miserable
apprehensions
the
young
violinist
was
playing
schubert
serenade
from
the
violin
came
the
cry
of
hungry
human
love
demanding
its
mate
questing
praying
half
despairing
and
yet
wooing
seeking
again
johnnie
piteous
gaze
roved
over
the
lineaments
she
noted
with
a
passion
of
tenderness
the
turn
of
head
and
hand
that
were
so
familiar
to
her
and
so
dear
oh
she
could
never
hate
him
for
it
but
it
was
hard
hard
to
be
a
wave
in
the
ocean
of
toil
that
supported
the
galleys
of
such
as
these
it
began
to
rain
again
softly
as
she
stood
there
scattered
drops
falling
on
her
bright
hair
and
she
gathered
her
dress
about
her
and
pressed
close
to
the
window
where
the
eaves
of
the
building
sheltered
her
forcing
herself
to
look
in
and
take
note
of
the
difference
between
those
people
in
there
and
her
own
lot
of
life
this
was
not
usually
johnnie
way
her
unfailing
optimism
prompted
her
always
to
measure
the
distance
below
her
and
be
glad
of
having
climbed
so
far
rather
than
to
dim
her
eyes
with
straining
them
toward
what
was
above
but
now
she
marked
mercilessly
the
light
yet
subdued
movements
the
deference
expressed
when
one
of
these
people
addressed
another
and
gray
stoddard
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
was
easily
the
most
marked
figure
in
it
who
was
she
to
think
she
might
be
his
friend
when
all
this
beautiful
world
of
ease
and
luxury
and
fair
speech
was
open
to
him
like
a
sword
flashed
back
to
her
memory
of
the
children
they
were
being
killed
in
the
mills
while
she
wasted
her
thoughts
and
longings
on
people
who
would
laugh
if
they
knew
of
her
presumptuous
devotion
she
turned
with
a
low
exclamation
of
astonishment
when
somebody
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
is
you
de
gal
miss
lyddy
sont
for
inquired
the
yellow
waitress
a
bit
sharply
no
yes
i
do
know
whether
miss
sessions
sent
for
me
or
not
johnnie
halted
out
but
eagerly
i
must
see
her
i
cassy
got
to
speak
to
her
right
now
cassy
regarded
the
newcomer
rather
scornfully
yet
everybody
liked
johnnie
and
the
servant
eventually
put
off
her
design
of
being
impressive
and
said
in
a
fairly
friendly
manner
you
could
noways
see
her
now
i
could
disturb
her
whilst
got
company
without
you
want
to
put
on
this
here
cap
and
apron
and
come
me
sarve
the
refreshments
dey
was
a
gal
comin
to
resist
me
but
she
ai
put
in
her
disappearance
yet
ai
no
time
for
foolin
dis
ai
johnnie
debated
a
moment
a
servant
livery
but
deanie
was
sick
and
with
a
sudden
impulsive
movement
and
somewhat
to
surprise
johnnie
followed
into
the
pantry
seized
the
proffered
cap
and
apron
and
proceeded
to
put
them
on
i
got
to
see
miss
sessions
she
repeated
more
to
herself
than
to
the
negress
maybe
what
i
have
to
say
will
only
take
a
minute
i
reckon
she
wo
mind
even
if
she
has
got
company
it
well
i
got
to
see
her
some
way
and
taking
the
tray
of
frail
dainty
cups
and
saucers
cassy
brought
her
she
started
with
it
to
the
parlour
the
music
was
just
dying
down
to
its
last
wail
when
gray
looked
up
and
caught
sight
of
her
coming
his
mind
had
been
full
of
her
to
him
certain
pieces
of
music
always
meant
certain
people
and
the
serenade
could
bring
him
nothing
but
johnnie
consadine
face
his
startled
eyes
encountered
with
distaste
the
cap
pinned
to
her
hair
descended
to
the
white
apron
that
covered
her
black
skirt
and
rested
in
astonishment
on
the
tray
that
held
the
coffee
cream
and
sugar
begin
here
cassie
prompted
her
assistant
and
johnnie
stopping
offered
her
tray
of
cups
gray
indignant
glance
went
from
the
girl
herself
to
his
hostess
what
foolery
was
this
why
should
johnnie
consadine
dress
herself
as
a
servant
and
wait
on
lydia
sessions
guests
before
the
two
reached
him
he
turned
abruptly
and
went
into
the
library
where
miss
sessions
stood
for
a
moment
quite
alone
her
face
brightened
he
had
sought
her
society
very
much
less
of
late
she
looked
hopefully
for
a
renewal
of
that
earlier
companionship
which
seemed
by
contrast
almost
intimate
have
you
hired
johnnie
consadine
as
a
waitress
stoddard
asked
her
in
a
voice
i
should
have
supposed
that
her
place
in
the
mill
would
pay
her
more
and
offer
better
prospects
no
oh
no
said
miss
sessions
startled
and
considerably
disappointed
at
the
subject
he
had
selected
to
converse
upon
how
does
she
come
to
be
here
with
a
cap
and
apron
on
pursued
stoddard
with
an
edge
to
his
tone
which
he
could
not
wholly
subdue
i
really
do
understand
that
myself
lydia
sessions
told
him
i
made
no
arrangement
with
her
i
expected
to
have
a
couple
of
negresses
they
much
better
servants
you
know
of
course
when
a
girl
like
john
gets
a
little
taste
of
social
contact
and
recognition
she
may
go
to
considerable
lengths
to
gratify
her
desire
for
it
no
doubt
she
feels
proud
of
forcing
herself
in
this
evening
and
then
of
course
she
knows
she
will
be
well
paid
she
seems
to
be
doing
nicely
glancing
between
the
portieres
where
johnnie
bent
before
one
guest
or
another
offering
her
tray
of
cups
i
really
have
the
heart
to
reprove
her
then
i
think
i
shall
said
stoddard
with
sudden
resolution
if
you
do
mind
miss
sessions
would
you
let
her
come
in
and
talk
to
me
a
little
while
as
soon
as
she
has
finished
passing
the
coffee
i
really
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
outrageous
johnnie
is
a
girl
of
brains
and
abilities
and
we
who
have
her
true
welfare
at
heart
should
see
that
she
does
in
her
youth
and
ignorance
fall
into
such
errors
as
this
oh
if
you
like
i
talk
to
her
myself
said
miss
lydia
smoothly
the
conversation
was
not
so
different
from
others
that
she
and
stoddard
had
held
concerning
this
girl
deserts
and
welfare
she
added
after
an
instant
pause
speaking
quickly
with
heightened
colour
and
a
little
nervous
catch
in
her
voice
i
do
my
best
i
i
do
want
to
speak
harshly
of
john
but
i
must
in
truth
say
that
she
the
one
among
my
uplift
club
girls
that
has
been
least
satisfactory
to
me
in
what
way
inquired
stoddard
in
an
even
quiet
tone
well
i
should
be
a
little
puzzled
to
put
it
into
words
miss
sessions
answered
him
with
a
deprecating
smile
and
yet
it
there
the
feeling
that
john
consadine
is
i
hate
to
say
it
ungrateful
ungrateful
repeated
her
companion
his
eyes
steadily
on
miss
sessions
face
to
leave
johnnie
consadine
out
of
the
matter
entirely
what
else
do
you
expect
from
any
of
your
protégées
what
else
can
any
one
expect
who
goes
into
what
the
modern
world
calls
charitable
work
miss
sessions
studied
his
face
in
some
bewilderment
was
he
arraigning
her
or
sympathizing
with
her
he
said
no
more
he
left
upon
her
the
onus
of
further
speech
she
must
try
for
the
right
note
i
know
it
she
fumbled
desperately
and
is
it
disappointing
you
do
everything
you
possibly
can
for
people
and
they
seem
to
dislike
you
for
it
they
do
merely
seem
to
said
stoddard
almost
brusquely
they
do
dislike
and
despise
you
and
that
most
heartily
it
is
as
certain
a
result
as
that
two
and
two
make
four
you
have
pauperized
and
degraded
them
and
they
hate
you
for
it
lydia
sessions
shrank
back
on
the
seat
and
stared
at
him
her
hand
before
her
open
mouth
why
mr
stoddard
she
ejaculated
finally
i
thought
you
were
fully
in
sympathy
with
my
uplift
work
you
you
certainly
let
me
think
so
if
you
despised
it
as
you
now
say
why
did
you
help
me
and
and
all
that
stoddard
shook
his
head
no
he
demurred
a
little
wearily
i
do
despise
you
nor
your
work
as
for
helping
you
i
dislike
lobster
and
yet
i
conscientiously
provide
you
with
it
whenever
we
are
where
the
comestible
is
served
because
i
know
you
like
it
stoddard
broke
in
lydia
tragically
that
is
frivolous
these
are
grave
matters
and
i
thought
oh
i
thought
certainly
that
i
was
deserving
your
good
opinion
in
this
charitable
work
if
ever
i
deserved
such
a
thing
in
my
life
oh
deserved
repeated
stoddard
almost
impatiently
no
doubt
you
deserve
a
great
deal
more
than
my
praise
but
you
know
do
you
not
that
people
who
believe
as
i
do
regard
that
sort
of
philanthropy
as
a
barrier
to
progress
and
really
now
i
think
you
ought
to
admit
that
under
such
circumstances
i
have
behaved
with
great
friendliness
and
the
words
were
spoken
with
something
of
the
old
teasing
intonation
that
had
once
deluded
lydia
sessions
into
the
faith
that
she
held
a
relation
of
some
intimacy
to
this
man
she
glanced
at
him
fleetingly
then
though
she
felt
utterly
at
sea
made
one
more
desperate
effort
but
i
always
went
first
to
you
when
i
was
raising
money
for
my
uplift
work
and
you
gave
to
me
more
liberally
than
anybody
else
jerome
never
approved
of
it
hartley
grumbled
or
laughed
at
me
and
came
reluctantly
to
my
little
dances
and
receptions
i
sometimes
felt
that
i
was
going
against
all
my
world
except
you
i
depended
upon
your
approval
i
felt
that
you
were
in
full
sympathy
with
me
here
if
nowhere
else
she
looked
so
disproportionately
moved
by
the
matter
that
stoddard
smiled
a
little
i
sorry
he
said
at
last
i
see
now
that
i
have
been
taking
it
for
granted
all
along
that
you
understood
the
reservation
i
held
in
regard
to
this
matter
you
you
should
have
told
me
plainly
said
lydia
drearily
it
it
gives
me
a
strange
feeling
to
have
depended
so
entirely
on
you
and
then
to
find
out
that
you
were
thinking
of
me
all
the
while
as
jerome
does
have
i
been
inquired
stoddard
as
jerome
does
what
a
passion
it
seems
to
be
with
folks
to
classify
their
friends
people
call
me
a
socialist
because
i
am
trying
to
find
out
what
i
really
do
think
on
certain
economic
and
social
subjects
i
doubt
that
i
shall
ever
bring
up
underneath
any
precise
label
and
yet
some
people
would
think
it
egotistical
that
i
insisted
upon
being
a
class
to
myself
i
very
much
doubt
that
i
hold
hardwick
opinion
exactly
in
any
particular
he
looked
at
the
girl
with
a
sort
of
urgency
which
she
scarcely
comprehended
miss
sessions
he
said
i
wear
my
hair
longer
than
most
men
and
the
barber
is
always
deeply
grieved
at
my
obstinacy
i
never
eat
potatoes
and
many
persons
are
greatly
concerned
over
it
they
regard
the
exclusion
of
potatoes
from
one
dietary
as
almost
criminal
but
you
i
expect
in
you
more
tolerance
concerning
my
peculiarities
why
must
you
care
at
all
what
i
think
or
what
my
views
are
in
this
matter
oh
i
do
understand
you
at
all
lydia
said
distressfully
no
agreed
stoddard
with
an
interrogative
note
in
his
voice
but
after
all
there
no
need
for
people
to
be
so
determined
to
understand
each
other
is
there
lydia
looked
at
him
with
swimming
eyes
why
did
you
tell
me
not
to
do
those
things
she
managed
finally
to
say
with
some
composure
tell
you
not
to
do
things
that
you
had
thought
out
for
yourself
and
decided
on
asked
stoddard
oh
no
miss
sessions
what
of
your
own
development
i
had
no
business
to
interfere
like
that
you
might
be
exactly
right
about
it
and
i
wrong
so
far
as
you
yourself
were
concerned
and
even
if
i
were
right
and
you
wrong
the
only
chance
of
growth
for
you
was
to
exploit
the
matter
and
find
it
out
for
yourself
i
do
understand
a
word
you
say
lydia
sessions
repeated
dully
that
the
kind
of
thing
you
used
always
to
talk
when
you
and
i
were
planning
for
john
consadine
development
is
what
a
woman
wants
she
wants
she
needs
to
understand
how
to
please
those
she
approves
if
she
fails
anywhere
and
those
she
well
if
somebody
that
she
has
confidence
in
tells
her
why
then
she
know
better
next
time
you
should
have
told
me
her
eyes
overflowed
as
she
made
an
end
but
stoddard
adopted
a
tone
of
determined
lightness
dear
me
he
said
gently
what
reactionary
views
you
out
of
temper
with
me
this
evening
i
get
on
your
nerves
with
my
theorizing
forgive
me
and
forget
all
about
it
lydia
sessions
smiled
kindly
on
her
guest
without
speaking
but
one
thing
remained
to
her
out
of
it
all
gray
stoddard
thought
ill
of
her
work
it
carried
her
further
from
him
instead
of
nearer
so
many
months
of
effort
worse
than
wasted
at
that
instant
she
had
sight
of
shade
buckheath
dark
face
in
the
entry
she
got
to
her
feet
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
wanly
i
think
there
is
some
one
out
there
that
i
ought
to
speak
to
chapter
xvii
a
victim
in
the
spinning
room
at
the
victory
mill
with
its
tall
frames
and
endlessly
turning
bobbins
where
the
languid
thread
ran
from
hank
to
spool
and
the
tired
little
feet
must
walk
the
narrow
aisles
between
the
jennies
watching
if
perchance
a
filament
had
broken
a
knot
caught
or
other
mischance
occurred
and
right
it
deanie
plodded
for
what
seemed
to
her
many
years
milo
and
pony
both
had
work
now
in
another
department
and
lissy
frames
were
quite
across
the
noisy
big
room
whenever
the
little
girl
could
get
away
from
her
own
task
and
the
eye
of
the
room
boss
she
ran
across
to
the
small
ailing
sister
and
hugged
her
hard
begging
her
not
to
feel
bad
not
to
cry
johnnie
was
bound
to
come
before
long
with
the
morbidness
of
a
sick
child
deanie
came
to
dread
these
assurances
finding
them
almost
as
distressing
as
her
own
strange
tormenting
sensations
the
room
was
insufferably
close
because
it
had
rained
and
the
windows
were
all
tightly
shut
the
flare
of
light
vitiated
the
air
heated
it
but
seemed
to
the
child
sick
sense
to
illuminate
nothing
sometimes
she
found
herself
walking
into
the
machinery
and
put
out
a
reckless
little
hand
to
guard
her
steps
sister
johnnie
had
said
she
would
come
and
take
her
away
sister
johnnie
was
the
providence
that
was
never
known
to
fail
deanie
kept
on
doggedly
and
tied
threads
almost
asleep
the
room
opened
and
shut
like
an
accordion
before
her
fevered
vision
the
floor
heaved
and
trembled
under
her
stumbling
feet
to
lie
down
to
lie
down
anywhere
and
sleep
that
was
the
almost
intolerable
longing
that
possessed
her
her
mouth
was
hot
and
dry
the
little
white
peaked
face
like
a
new
moon
grew
strangely
luminous
in
its
pallor
her
eyes
stung
in
their
sockets
those
desolate
blue
eyes
dark
with
unshed
tears
heavy
with
sleep
she
had
turned
her
row
and
started
back
when
there
came
before
her
so
plain
that
she
almost
thought
she
might
wet
her
feet
in
the
clear
water
a
vision
of
the
at
home
up
on
unaka
where
she
and
lissy
used
to
play
there
among
the
giant
roots
of
the
old
oak
on
its
bank
was
the
house
they
had
built
of
big
stones
and
bright
bits
of
broken
dishes
there
lay
her
doll
flung
down
among
gay
fallen
leaves
a
little
toad
squatted
beside
it
and
near
by
was
the
tiny
gourd
that
was
their
dipper
oh
for
a
drink
from
that
spring
she
caught
sight
of
mandy
meacham
passing
the
door
and
ran
to
her
heedless
of
consequences
mandy
she
pleaded
taking
hold
of
the
woman
skirts
and
throwing
back
her
reeling
head
to
stare
up
into
the
face
above
her
mandy
johnnie
said
she
come
but
it
a
awful
long
time
and
i
scared
fall
into
some
of
these
here
old
machines
i
feel
that
bad
wo
you
go
tell
sis
johnnie
i
waitin
for
her
mandy
glanced
forward
through
the
toward
her
own
silent
looms
then
down
at
the
little
flushed
face
at
her
knee
if
she
dared
to
do
things
as
johnnie
dared
she
would
pick
up
the
baby
and
leave
the
very
thought
of
it
terrified
her
no
she
must
get
johnnie
herself

and
kissed

whispering

and
bring

minute
then
she
turned
and
swiftly
lest
her
courage
evaporate
hurried
down
the
stair
and
to
the
time

said
brusquely

as

this
very
minute
her
voice
had
faltered
a
bit
at
the
conclusion
yet
she
made
an
end
of
it
and
hurried
away
with
a
choke
in
her
throat
the
man
stared
after
her
angrily
well
he
ejaculated
finally
she
got
her
nerve
with
her
old
himes

what
he
got
to
say
a
party
of
young
fellows
was
tramping
down
the
village
street
singing
one
of
them
carried
a
guitar
and
struck
now
and
again
a
random
chord
upon
its
strings
the
street
was
dark
but
as
the
singers
stepping
rythmically
passed
the
open
door
of
the
store
mandy
recognized
a
shape
she
knew
shade
shade
buckheath
wait
thar
she
called
to
him
the
others
lingered
too
a
moment
till
they
saw
it
was
a
girl
following
then
they
turned
and
sauntered
slowly
on
still
singing
ef
i
was
a
little
bird
i
nest
in
the
tallest
tree
that
leans
over
the
waters
of
the
beautiful
tennessee
the
words
came
back
to
buckheath
and
mandy
in
velvety
bass
and
boyish
tenor
shade
whar
johnnie
panted
mandy
shaking
him
by
the
arm

up

the
house

and
shade
whar
johnnie
buckheath
looked
down
into
her
working
tragic
face
and
his
mouth
hardened

ai
at

he
said
finally
i

and
she
ai

told
me
i
disremember
which
i
reckon
you
find
her
thar
what
do
you
want
of
her
it
deanie
she
glanced
fearfully
past
his
shoulder
to
where
the
big
clock
on
the
grocery
wall
showed
through
its
dim
window
it
was
ten
the
lateness
of
the
hour
seemed
to
strike
her
with
fresh
terror
shade
come
along
of
me
she
pleaded
i
so
skeered
i
never
shall
have
the
heart
to
go
in
and
ax
for
johnnie
this
time
o
night
at
that
thar
fine
house
how

talk
up
to
them
swell
people
like
she
does
is
more
than
i
know
you
go
with
me
and
ax
is
she
thar
the
group
of
young
men
had
crossed
the
bridge
and
were
well
on
their
way
to
the
inn
buckheath
glanced
after
them
doubtfully
and
turned
to
walk
at
mandy
side
when
they
came
to
the
gate
the
woman
hung
back
whimpering
at
sight
of
the
festal
array
and
sound
of
the
voices
within
they
got
a
party
she
deprecated
my
old
dress
is
jest
as
dirty
as
the
floor
you
go
ax
shade
as
she
spoke
johnnie
carrying
a
tray
of
cups
and
saucers
passed
a
lighted
window
and
buckheath
uttered
a
sudden
unpremeditated
oath
i
do
know
what
god
almighty
means
makin
women
such
fools
he
growled
what
call
had
johnnie
consadine
got
to
come
here
and
act
the
servant
for
them
rich
folks
runnin
around
after
gray
stoddard
and
much
good
may
it
do
her
mandy
crowded
herself
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
dripping
evergreens
and
shade
went
boldly
up
on
the
side
porch
she
saw
the
door
opened
and
her
escort
admitted
then
through
the
glass
was
aware
of
lydia
sessions
in
an
evening
frock
coming
into
the
small
entry
and
conferring
at
length
with
him
her
attention
was
diverted
from
them
by
the
appearance
of
johnnie
herself
just
inside
a
window
she
ran
forward
and
tapped
on
the
pane
johnnie
put
down
her
tray
and
came
swiftly
out
passing
shade
and
miss
sessions
in
the
side
entry
with
a
word
what
is
it
she
inquired
of
mandy
with
a
premonition
of
disaster
in
her
tones
hit
deanie
choked
the
meacham
woman
she
right
sick
and
they
wo
let
her
leave
the
mill
leastways
she
skeered
to
ask
and
so
am
i
i
ought
to
come
and
tell
you
johnnie
was
that
right
you
wanted
me
to
did
you
anxiously
yes
yes
yes
cried
johnnie
reaching
up
swift
nervous
fingers
to
unfasten
the
cap
from
her
hair
thrusting
it
in
the
pocket
of
the
apron
and
untying
the
apron
strings
wait
a
minute
i
must
give
these
things
back
oh
let
hurry
it
was
but
a
moment
after
that
she
emerged
once
more
on
the
porch
and
apparently
for
the
first
time
noticed
buckheath
then
miss
sessions
was
saying
to
him
as
he
moved
toward
the
two
girls
morning
and
with
a
patronizing
nod
to
them
all
she
withdrew
and
rejoined
her
guests
i
never
found
you
when
i
went
up
to
the
house
explained
mandy
nervously
and
so
i
stopped
shade
on
the
street
and
axed
him
would
he
come
along
with
me
maybe
it
would
do
some
good
if
he
was
to
go
up
with
us
to
the
mill
they
pay
more
attention
to
a
man
person
i
tell
you
johnnie
the
baby
plumb
broke
down
and
sick
the
three
were
moving
swiftly
along
the
darkened
street
now
i
going
to
take
the
children
away
from
pap
johnnie
said
in
a
curious
voice
rapid
and
monotonous
as
though
she
were
reciting
something
to
herself
i
have
obliged
to
do
it
there
must
be
a
law
somewhere
god
wo
let
me
fail
grunted
buckheath
instantly
you
ca
do
such
a
thing
ef
you
was
married
and
yo
mother
would
let
you
adopt
i
reckon
the
courts
might
agree
to
that
shade
johnnie
turned
upon
him
you
got
more
influence
with
pap
himes
than
anybody
i
believe
if
you
talk
to
him
he
let
me
have
the
children
i
could
support
them
now
i
do
want
to
fall
out
with
pap
himes
for
nothing
responded
shade
if
you
say
that
you
wed
me
morning
i
go
to
pap
and
get
him
to
give
up
the
children
neither
of
them
paid
any
attention
to
mandy
who
listened
and
to
this
singular
courtship
or
i
get
him
to
take
out
of
the
mill
you
right
i
ai
got
a
bit
of
doubt
i
could
do
it
and
if
i
do
do
it
you
have
me
an
illumination
fell
upon
johnnie
mind
she
saw
that
buckheath
was
in
league
with
her
stepfather
and
that
the
pressure
was
put
on
according
to
the
younger
man
ideas
and
would
be
instantly
withdrawn
at
his
bidding
yet
when
the
swift
revulsion
such
knowledge
brought
with
it
made
her
ready
to
dismiss
him
at
once
thought
of
deanie
wasted
little
countenance
with
the
red
burning
high
on
the
sharp
unchildish
cheekbone
stayed
her
for
a
while
she
walked
with
bent
head
heavily
before
her
mind
eye
went
the
picture
of
gray
stoddard
among
his
own
people
in
his
own
world
where
she
could
never
come
have
it
your
way
she
said
finally
in
a
suffering
voice
what
that
you
say
are
you
goin
to
take
me
demanded
buckheath
pressing
close
and
reaching
out
a
possessive
arm
to
put
around
her
i
said
yes
johnnie
shivered
pushing
his
hand
away
but
but
only
be
when
you
can
come
to
me
and
tell
me
that
the
children
are
all
right
if
you
fail
me
there
i
back
at
the
victory
downstairs
went
reardon
messenger
to
where
pap
himes
was
sweating
over
the
new
machinery
work
always
put
the
old
man
in
a
sort
of
incandescent
fury
and
now
as
bob
spoke
to
him
he
raised
an
inflamed
face
from
which
the
small
eyes
twinkled
redly
with
a
grunt
of
inquiry
that
youngest
gal
o
yours
the
man
repeated
she
tryin
to
leave
her
job
and
go
home
reardon
said
tell
you
an
see
what
you
had
to
say
the
lord
knows
we
have
trouble
enough
with
those
young
i
glad
when
any
of
their
folks
that
got
sand
is
around
to
make
behave
i
reckon
she
ca
come
it
over
you
gid
himes
straightened
up
with
a
groan
under
any
exertion
his
rheumatic
old
back
always
punished
him
cruelly
for
the
days
of
indolence
that
had
let
its
suppleness
depart
huh
he
grunted
whar
she
at
up
in
the
spinnin
room
well
is
they
enough
of
you
up
thar
to
keep
her
tendin
to
business
for
a
spell
till
i
can
get
this
thing
levelled
he
held
to
the
mechanism
he
was
adjusting
and
harangued
wheezily
from
behind
it
i
cai
drop
my
job
an
canter
upstairs
every
time
one
o
you
fellers
whistles
the
chap
ai
more
two
foot
long
looks
like
might
hold
on
to
her
for
one
while
i
be
thar
soon
as
i
can
a
hour
and
he
returned
savagely
to
his
work
when
mandy
left
her
deanie
tried
for
a
time
to
tend
her
frames
but
the
endlessly
turning
spools
the
edges
of
the
jennies
blurred
before
her
fevered
eyes
everything
even
her
fear
of
pap
himes
her
dread
of
the
room
boss
finally
became
vague
in
her
mind
more
and
more
she
dreaded
little
lissy
visitations
and
after
nearly
an
hour
she
stole
toward
the
door
looking
half
deliriously
for
sister
johnnie
nobody
noticed
in
the
noisy
flaring
room
that
spool
after
spool
on
her
frame
fouled
its
thread
and
ceased
turning
as
the
little
figure
left
its
post
and
hesitated
like
a
scared
small
animal
toward
the
main
exit
pap
himes
having
come
to
where
he
could
leave
his
work
in
the
basement
climbed
painfully
the
many
stairs
to
the
spinning
room
and
met
her
close
to
where
the
big
belt
rose
up
to
the
great
shaft
that
gave
power
to
every
machine
in
that
department
the
loving
master
of
the
big
yellow
cat
had
always
cherished
a
somewhat
clumsily
concealed
dislike
and
hostility
to
deanie
perhaps
there
lingered
in
this
a
touch
of
of
his
wife
baby
perhaps
he
knew
instinctively
that
johnnie
rebellion
against
his
tyranny
was
always
strongest
where
deanie
was
concerned
why
ai
you
on
your
job
he
inquired
threateningly
as
the
child
saw
him
and
made
some
futile
attempt
to
shrink
back
out
of
his
way
i
feel
so
quare
pap
himes
the
little
girl
answered
him
beginning
to
cry
i
thes
want
to
lay
down
and
go
to
sleep
every
minute
huh
pap
exploded
his
favourite
expletive
till
it
sounded
ferocious
that
ai
quare
feelin
that
just
plain
laziness
you
git
back
thar
and
tend
them
frames
or
i
i
cai
i
cai
see
to
tend
i
right
blind
in
the
eyes
wailed
deanie
i
wish
sis
johnnie
would
come
i
she
would
commented
bob
conley
who
had
strolled
up
in
the
old
wake
reckon
sis
johnnie
would
run
things
to
suit
her
an
you
himes
you
can
cuss
me
out
good
an
plenty
but
i
take
notice
you
seem
to
have
trouble
makin
your
own
family
mind
you
shut
your
head
growled
pap
reardon
had
added
himself
to
the
spectators
see
here
the
foreman
argued
if
you
say
there
nothing
the
matter
with
that
gal
an
she
carries
on
till
we
have
to
let
her
go
home
she
goes
for
good
i
take
her
frames
away
from
her
pap
felt
that
a
formidable
show
of
authority
must
be
made
git
back
thar
he
roared
advancing
upon
the
child
raising
the
hand
that
still
held
the
wrench
with
which
he
had
been
working
on
the
machinery
down
stairs
git
back
thar
or
i
make
you
wish
you
had
when
i
tell
you
to
do
a
thing
do
you
name
johnnie
to
me
git
back
thar
with
a
faint
cry
the
child
cowered
away
from
him
it
is
unlikely
he
would
have
struck
her
with
the
upraised
tool
he
held
perhaps
he
did
not
intend
a
blow
at
all
but
one
or
two
small
frame
tenders
paused
at
the
ends
of
their
lanes
to
watch
the
scene
with
avid
eyes
to
extract
the
last
thrill
from
the
sensation
that
was
being
kindly
brought
into
the
midst
of
their
monotonous
toilsome
hours
and
lissy
who
was
creeping
up
anxiously
yet
keeping
out
of
the
range
of
himes
eye
crouched
as
though
the
hammer
had
been
raised
over
her
own
head
johnnie
said
began
the
little
girl
desperately
but
the
old
man
stung
to
greater
fury
sprang
at
her
she
stumbled
back
and
back
fell
against
the
slowly
moving
belt
her
frock
caught
in
the
rivets
which
were
just
passing
and
she
was
instantly
jerked
from
her
feet
if
any
one
of
the
three
men
looking
on
had
taken
prompt
action
the
child
might
have
been
rescued
at
once
but
stupid
terror
held
them
motionless
at
the
moment
johnnie
shade
and
mandy
coming
up
the
stairs
got
sight
of
the
group
pap
with
upraised
hammer
the
child
in
the
clutches
of
imminent
death
with
shrill
outcries
the
other
juvenile
workers
swiftly
gathered
in
a
crowd
one
broke
away
and
fled
down
the
long
room
screaming
you
pony
consadine
milo
come
here
pap
himes
is
sister
the
old
man
shaking
all
through
his
bulk
stared
with
fallen
jaw
mandy
shrieked
and
leaped
up
the
few
remaining
steps
to
reach
deanie
who
was
already
above
the
of
a
tall
man
pap
shade
quick
do
you
see
she
be
killed
mandy
screamed
in
frenzy
something
in
the
atmosphere
must
have
made
itself
felt
for
no
sound
could
have
penetrated
the
din
of
the
weaving
room
yet
some
of
the
women
left
their
looms
and
came
running
in
behind
the
two
pale
scared
little
brothers
to
add
their
shrieks
to
the
general
clamour
deanie
fellow
workers
poor
little
souls
denied
their
childish
share
of
the
excitements
gazed
with
a
sort
of
awful
relish
only
johnnie
speeding
down
the
room
away
from
it
all
was
doing
anything
rational
to
avert
the
catastrophe
the
child
hung
on
the
slowly
moving
belt
inert
a
tiny
rag
of
life
with
her
mop
of
tangled
yellow
curls
her
white
little
face
its
blue
eyes
closed
when
she
reached
the
top
where
the
pulley
was
close
against
the
ceiling
her
brains
would
be
dashed
out
and
the
small
body
dragged
to
pieces
between
beam
and
ceiling
those
who
looked
at
her
realized
this
numbed
by
the
inevitable
they
made
no
effort
save
milo
who
at
imminent
risk
of
his
own
life
was
climbing
on
a
frame
near
at
hand
but
pony
flew
at
himes
beating
the
old
man
with
inadequate
fists
and
screaming
you
git
her
down
from
thar
git
her
down
this
minute
she
be
killed
i
tell
ye
she
be
killed
i
tell
ye
poor
mandy
made
inarticulate
moanings
and
reached
up
her
arms
shade
buckheath
cursed
softly
under
his
breath
the
women
and
children
stared
eager
to
lose
no
detail
i
always
have
said
and
i
always
shall
say
that
chaps
as
young
as
that
ai
got
no
business
around
whar
machinery
at
bob
conley
kept
shouting
over
and
over
in
a
high
strange
mechanical
voice
plainly
quite
unconscious
that
he
spoke
at
all
the
child
was
so
near
the
ceiling
now
that
a
universal
groan
proceeded
from
the
watchers
then
all
at
once
the
belt
ceased
to
move
and
the
clash
and
tumult
were
stilled
johnnie
who
had
flown
to
the
little
controlling
wheel
to
throw
off
the
power
came
running
back
crying
out
in
the
sudden
quiet
shade
quick
get
a
ladder
hold
something
under
there
she
might
oh
my
god
for
deanie
frock
had
pulled
free
and
the
little
form
hurled
down
before
johnnie
could
reach
them
but
the
devoted
mandy
was
there
her
futile
inadequate
skirts
upheld
into
them
the
small
body
dropped
and
together
the
two
came
to
the
floor
with
a
dull
sort
of
crunch
when
johnnie
reached
the
prostrate
pair
mandy
was
struggling
to
her
knees
gasping
but
deanie
lay
twisted
just
as
she
had
fallen
the
little
face
sunken
and
deathly
a
tiny
trickle
of
blood
coming
from
a
corner
of
her
parted
lips
oh
my
baby
oh
my
baby
they
killed
my
baby
deanie
deanie
deanie
wailed
mandy
johnnie
was
on
her
knees
beside
the
child
feeling
her
over
with
tremulous
hands
her
face
was
bleached
and
her
eyes
stared
fearfully
at
the
motionless
lips
of
the
little
one
from
which
that
scarlet
stream
trickled
but
she
set
her
own
lips
silently
thar
right
thar
in
the
side
groaned
mandy
she
all
staved
in
on
the
side
that
my
pore
little
deanie
oh
i
tried
to
ketch
her
but
she
broke
right
through
and
pulled
my
skirts
out
of
my
hand
and
hit
the
floor
pap
had
drawn
nearer
on
shaking
limbs
the
children
crowded
so
close
that
johnnie
looked
up
and
motioned
them
back
shade
you
run
for
a
doctor
and
have
a
carriage
fetched
she
ordered
briefly
is
lord
god
is
she
dead
faltered
the
old
man
ef
she
ai
dead
now
she
die
mandy
answered
him
shrilly
they
ai
no
flesh
on
her
she
run
down
to
a
pore
little
skeleton
what
the
factories
does
to
women
and
children
they
jest
eats
up
and
spits
out
they
bones
well
i
never
aimed
to
skeer
her
said
himes
but
the
little
fool
johnnie
flaming
glance
silenced
him
and
his
voice
died
away
a
sort
of
a
rasp
in
his
throat
mechanically
he
glanced
up
to
the
point
on
the
great
belt
from
which
the
child
had
fallen
and
measured
the
distance
to
the
floor
he
scratched
his
bald
head
dubiously
and
edged
back
from
the
tragedy
he
had
made
everybody
knows
i
never
hit
her
he
muttered
as
he
went
chapter
xviii
light
gray
stoddard
eyes
had
followed
lydia
sessions
when
she
went
into
the
hall
to
speak
to
shade
buckheath
he
had
a
glimpse
of
johnnie
too
in
the
passage
he
noted
that
she
later
left
the
house
with
buckheath
mandy
meacham
was
beyond
his
range
of
vision
and
the
pang
that
went
through
him
at
the
sight
was
a
strangely
mingled
one
the
talk
between
him
and
his
hostess
had
been
enlightening
to
both
of
them
it
showed
lydia
sessions
not
only
where
she
stood
with
gray
but
it
brought
home
to
her
startlingly
and
as
nothing
had
yet
done
the
strength
of
johnnie
hold
upon
him
while
it
forced
gray
himself
to
realize
that
ever
since
that
morning
when
he
met
the
girl
on
the
bridge
going
to
put
her
little
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
victory
mill
he
had
behaved
more
like
a
sulky
disappointed
lover
than
a
staunch
friend
he
confessed
frankly
to
himself
that
had
johnnie
been
a
boy
a
young
man
instead
of
a
beautiful
and
appealing
woman
he
would
have
been
prompt
to
go
to
her
and
remonstrate
he
would
have
made
no
bones
of
having
the
matter
out
clearly
and
fully
he
blamed
himself
much
for
the
estrangement
which
he
had
allowed
to
grow
between
them
he
knew
instinctively
about
what
shade
buckheath
was
certainly
no
fit
mate
for
johnnie
consadine
and
for
the
better
to
desert
her
poor
helpless
unschooled
girl
could
only
operate
to
push
her
toward
the
worse
these
thoughts
kept
stoddard
wakeful
company
till
almost
morning
dawn
came
with
a
soft
wind
out
of
the
west
all
the
odours
of
spring
on
its
breath
and
a
penitent
warmth
to
apologize
for
last
night
storm
stoddard
faced
his
day
and
decided
that
he
would
begin
it
with
an
horseback
ride
he
called
up
his
stable
boy
over
the
telephone
and
when
jim
brought
round
roan
sultan
saddled
there
was
a
pause
as
of
custom
for
conversation
heared
about
the
accident
over
to
the
victory
mr
stoddard
jim
inquired
no
said
gray
wheeling
sharply
anybody
hurt
one
o
pap
himes
stepchildren
mighty
near
killed
they
say
the
boy
told
him
i
seen
miss
johnnie
consadine
when
they
was
bringing
the
little
gal
down
it
seems
they
sent
for
her
over
to
hardwickses
where
she
was
at
gray
mounted
quickly
settled
himself
in
the
saddle
and
glanced
down
the
street
which
would
lead
him
past
himes
place
for
months
now
he
had
been
instinctively
avoiding
that
part
of
town
poor
johnnie
she
might
be
a
disappointing
character
but
he
knew
well
that
she
was
full
of
love
he
remembered
her
eyes
when
nearly
a
year
ago
up
in
the
mist
and
sweetness
of
april
on
the
unakas
she
had
told
him
of
the
baby
sister
and
the
other
little
ones
she
must
be
suffering
now
almost
without
reflection
he
turned
his
horse
head
and
rode
toward
the
forlorn
himes
as
he
drew
near
he
noticed
a
huddled
figure
at
the
head
of
the
steps
and
coming
up
made
it
out
to
be
himes
himself
sitting
elbows
on
knees
staring
straight
ahead
of
him
pap
had
not
undressed
at
all
but
he
had
taken
out
his
false
teeth
to
rest
his
jaws
a
spell
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
and
the
result
was
startling
his
cheeks
were
fallen
in
to
such
an
extent
that
the
blinking
red
eyes
above
looked
larger
it
was
as
though
the
old
rascal
crimes
of
callous
selfishness
and
greed
had
suddenly
aged
him
stoddard
pulled
in
his
horse
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
i
hear
one
of
the
little
girls
was
hurt
in
the
mill
last
night
was
she
badly
injured
which
one
was
it
he
asked
abruptly
hit
deanie
she
all
right
mumbled
pap
got
the
whole
house
uptore
and
laurelly
miscallin
me
till
i
do
know
which
way
to
look
and
now
the
little
dickens
is
to
git
well
all
right
chaps
is
tough
i
tell
ye
ye
cai
kill
you
people
must
have
thought
so
said
stoddard
or
you
would
have
brought
these
little
ones
down
and
hired
them
to
the
cotton
mill
johnnie
knew
what
that
meant
the
words
had
come
almost
involuntarily
the
old
man
stared
at
the
speaker
breathing
hard
what
johnnie
consadine
got
to
do
with
it
he
inquired
finally
the
stepdaddy
of
the
children
and
johnnie
stepdaddy
too
for
the
matter
of
that
and
what
i
say
goes
did
you
hire
the
children
at
the
victory
inquired
stoddard
swiftly
back
across
his
memory
came
the
picture
of
johnnie
with
her
poor
little
sheep
for
the
shambles
clustered
about
her
on
the
bridge
before
the
victory
mill
did
you
hire
the
children
to
the
factory
he
repeated
now
stoddard
began
the
old
man
between
bluster
and
whine
i
talked
about
them
chaps
to
the
superintendent
of
yo
mill
an
said
you
did
want
none
of
that
size
and
one
o
yo
men
he
was
a
room
boss
i
reckon
spoke
up
right
sassy
to
me
as
sassy
as
johnnie
consadine
herself
and
god
knows
she
ai
got
no
respect
for
them
that
set
over
her
i
had
obliged
to
let
go
to
the
victory
but
i
do
think
you
have
any
call
to
hold
it
me
johnnie
was
plumb
impident
about
it
plumb
impident
stoddard
glanced
up
at
the
windows
and
made
as
though
to
dismount
all
night
at
his
pillow
had
stood
the
accusation
that
he
had
been
cruel
to
johnnie
now
as
himes
revelations
went
on
and
he
saw
what
her
futile
efforts
had
been
as
he
guessed
a
part
of
her
sufferings
it
seemed
he
must
hurry
to
her
and
brush
away
the
tangle
of
misunderstanding
which
he
had
allowed
to
grow
up
between
them
they
worked
over
that
thar
chap
off
an
on
all
night
the
old
man
said
looks
like
if
they
keep
hit
up
she
begin
to
think
the
matter
of
her
gray
realized
that
his
visit
at
this
moment
would
be
he
would
ride
on
through
the
gap
now
and
call
as
he
came
back
i
had
obliged
to
find
me
a
place
whar
i
could
hire
out
them
chaps
the
miserable
old
man
before
him
went
on
garrulously
they
nothin
like
mill
work
to
take
the
davilment
out
o
young
some
of
them
call
you
names
and
make
faces
at
you
even
whilst
you
goin
through
the
mill
yard
and
think
what
they
be
ef
they
worked
i
a
old
man
and
when
i
married
laurelly
and
took
the
keepin
o
her
passel
chaps
on
my
back
i
aimed
to
make
it
pay
laurelly
she
wo
work
he
looked
helplessly
at
stoddard
like
a
child
about
to
cry
she
told
me
up
and
down
that
she
never
had
worked
in
no
mill
and
she
was
too
old
to
she
said
the
noise
of
the
thing
from
the
outside
was
enough
to
show
her
that
she
did
want
to
go
inside
and
go
she
would
not
but
she
let
her
children
go
she
and
johnnie
muttered
stoddard
settling
himself
in
his
saddle
well
i
like
to
see
either
of
theirselves
returned
pap
himes
with
a
reminiscence
of
his
former
manner
johnnie
ai
had
the
decency
to
give
me
her
wages
not
once
since
i
been
her
pappy
the
onliest
money
i
ever
had
from
her
to
pay
her
board
was
when
she
tried
to
buy
them
chaps
out
o
workin
in
the
mill
but
when
i
put
my
foot
down
an
told
her
that
the
chillen
could
work
in
the
mill
without
a
beatin
or
with
one
jest
as
she
might
see
and
choose
she
had
a
little
sense
and
took
over
and
hired
herself
baylor
told
me
afterward
that
she
tried
to
make
him
say
he
did
want
but
baylor
and
me
stands
together
an
miss
johnnie
failed
up
on
that
trick
pap
felt
an
altogether
misplaced
confidence
in
the
view
that
stoddard
as
a
male
was
likely
to
take
of
the
matter
a
man
is
obliged
to
be
boss
of
his
own
family
ai
that
so
mr
stoddard
he
demanded
i
said
the
chillen
had
to
go
into
the
mill
and
into
the
mill
they
went
they
all
wanted
to
go
at
the
start
and
laurelly
agreed
with
me
that
hit
was
the
right
thing
then
just
because
deanie
happened
to
a
accident
and
johnnie
took
up
for
her
laurelly
has
to
go
off
into
and
say
she
quit
me
soon
as
she
can
put
foot
to
the
ground
stoddard
made
no
response
to
this
but
touched
sultan
with
his
heel
and
moved
on
he
had
stopped
at
the
as
he
came
past
taking
from
his
personal
box
one
letter
this
he
opened
and
read
as
he
rode
slowly
away
halfway
up
the
first
rise
pap
saw
him
rein
in
and
turn
the
old
man
was
still
staring
when
gray
stopped
once
more
at
the
gate
see
here
himes
he
spoke
abruptly
this
concerns
you
this
letter
that
has
just
reached
me
pap
looked
at
the
younger
man
with
mere
curiosity
when
johnnie
was
first
given
a
spinning
room
to
look
after
said
gray
she
came
to
mr
sessions
and
myself
and
asked
permission
to
have
a
small
device
of
her
own
contrivance
used
on
the
frames
as
an
indicator
pap
shuffled
his
feet
uneasily
i
thought
no
more
about
the
matter
in
fact
i
not
been
in
the
spinning
department
for
for
some
time
stoddard
looked
down
at
the
hand
which
held
his
bridle
and
remembered
that
he
had
absented
himself
from
every
place
that
threatened
him
with
the
sight
of
johnnie
pap
was
breathing
audibly
through
his
open
mouth
she
she
never
had
nothin
made
he
whispered
out
the
ready
lie
hurriedly
scrambling
to
his
feet
and
down
the
steps
pressing
close
to
roan
sultan
shoulder
laying
a
wheedling
hand
on
the
bridle
looking
up
anxiously
into
the
stern
young
face
above
him
oh
yes
she
did
stoddard
returned
i
remember
now
hearing
some
of
the
children
from
the
room
say
that
she
had
a
device
which
worked
well
from
the
description
they
gave
of
it
i
judge
that
it
is
the
same
which
this
letter
tells
me
you
and
buckheath
are
offering
to
the
alabama
mills
trumbull
the
superintendent
says
that
you
and
buckheath
hold
the
patent
for
this
indicator
jointly
as
soon
as
i
can
consult
with
johnnie
we
will
see
about
the
matter
himes
let
go
the
roan
bridle
and
staggered
back
a
pace
or
two
staring
the
skies
had
fallen
his
heavy
mind
turned
slowly
toward
resentment
against
buckheath
he
wished
the
younger
conspirator
were
here
to
take
his
share
then
the
door
opened
and
shade
himself
came
out
wiping
his
mouth
he
was
fresh
from
the
breakfast
table
but
not
on
his
way
to
the
mill
since
it
was
still
too
early
he
gave
stoddard
a
surly
nod
as
he
passed
through
the
gate
and
on
down
the
street
in
the
direction
of
the
inn
himes
in
a
turmoil
of
stupid
uncertainty
once
or
twice
made
as
though
to
detain
him
his
slow
wits
refused
him
any
available
counsel
dazedly
he
fumbled
for
something
convincing
to
say
then
on
a
sudden
inspiration
he
once
more
laid
hold
of
the
bridle
and
began
to
speak
volubly
in
a
hoarse
undertone
name
o
god
stoddard
who
should
have
a
better
right
to
that
thar
patent
than
buck
and
me
i
the
gal
stepdaddy
an
he
the
man
she
goin
to
some
peculiar
quality
in
the
silence
of
gray
stoddard
seemed
finally
to
penetrate
the
old
fellow
understanding
he
looked
up
to
find
the
man
on
horseback
regarding
him
pale
and
with
eyes
angrily
bright
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
windows
of
the
house
behind
him
moistened
his
lips
once
again
gulped
and
finally
resumed
in
a
manner
both
whining
and
aggressive
now
stoddard
i
want
to
talk
to
you
mighty
plain
the
whole
cottonville
is
full
o
tales
about
you
and
johnnie
yes
the
truth
he
stood
staring
down
at
his
big
shuffling
feet
laboriously
sorting
in
his
own
mind
such
phrases
as
it
might
do
to
use
the
difficulty
of
what
he
had
to
say
blocked
speech
for
so
long
that
stoddard
in
a
curiously
quiet
voice
finally
prompted
him
tales
he
repeated
what
tales
mr
himes
why
they
ai
a
old
woman
in
town
nor
a
young
one
neither
i
believe
in
my
soul
that
the
young
ones
is
the
worst
that
ai
been
talkin
talkin
bad
ever
since
you
took
johnnie
to
ride
in
your
again
there
came
a
long
pause
stoddard
stared
down
on
gideon
himes
and
himes
stared
at
his
own
feet
well
stoddard
quiet
voice
once
more
urged
his
accuser
forward
pap
rolled
his
head
between
his
shoulders
with
a
negative
motion
which
intimated
that
it
was
not
well
and
lending
her
books
and
all
sich
he
pursued
doggedly
that
kind
o
carryin
on
ai
decent
and
you
know
it
ai
buck
knows
it
ai
but
he
willin
to
have
her
he
told
her
he
was
willin
to
have
her
and
the
fool
gal
let
on
like
she
did
want
him
he
came
here
to
board
at
my
house
because
she
would
scarcely
so
much
as
speak
to
him
elsewhere
by
the
light
of
these
statements
stoddard
read
what
poor
persecution
had
been
the
details
of
it
he
could
not
of
course
know
yet
he
saw
in
that
moment
largely
how
she
had
been
harried
at
the
instant
of
seeing
came
that
swift
and
mighty
revulsion
that
follows
surely
when
we
have
misprized
and
misunderstood
those
dear
to
us
what
is
it
you
want
of
me
he
inquired
of
himes
why
just
this
here
pap
told
him
you
let
johnnie
consadine
alone
he
leaned
even
closer
and
spoke
in
a
yet
lower
tone
because
a
number
of
girls
were
emerging
from
the
house
and
starting
down
the
steps
a
big
rich
feller
like
you
do
mean
any
good
by
a
girl
fixed
the
way
johnnie
is
you
would
marry
her
then
let
her
alone
things
ai
got
so
bad
but
what
buck
is
still
willin
to
have
her
you
would
marry
her
stoddard
looked
down
at
the
shameful
old
man
with
eyes
that
were
indecipherable
if
the
impulse
was
strong
in
him
to
twist
the
unclean
old
throat
against
any
further
it
gave
no
heat
to
the
tone
in
which
he
answered
it
you
and
your
kind
that
say
i
mean
harm
to
johnnie
and
that
i
would
not
marry
her
why
should
i
intend
ill
toward
her
why
should
i
marry
her
i
would
i
would
marry
her
as
he
made
this
to
him
the
only
possible
defence
of
the
poor
girl
pap
faltered
slowly
back
uttering
a
gurgling
expression
of
astonishment
with
a
sense
of
surprise
stoddard
saw
in
his
face
only
dismay
and
chagrin
hit
hit
a
lie
himes
mumbled
ye
never
do
it
in
the
world
stoddard
gathered
up
his
bridle
rein
preparatory
to
moving
on
you
an
old
man
himes
he
said
coldly
and
you
are
excited
but
you
do
want
to
say
any
more
that
quite
enough
of
that
sort
of
thing
then
he
loosened
the
rein
on
roan
sultan
and
moved
away
down
the
street
gideon
himes
stood
and
gazed
after
him
with
bulging
eyes
gray
stoddard
married
to
johnnie
he
tried
to
adjust
his
dull
wits
to
the
new
position
of
affairs
tried
to
cipher
the
problem
with
this
amazing
new
element
introduced
last
night
scene
of
violence
when
the
injured
child
was
brought
home
went
dismally
before
his
eyes
laurella
had
said
she
would
leave
him
so
soon
as
she
could
put
foot
to
the
floor
he
had
expected
to
coax
her
with
gifts
and
money
with
concessions
in
regard
to
the
children
if
it
must
be
but
with
a
rich
man
for
a
of
course
she
would
go
he
would
never
see
her
face
again
and
suddenly
he
flung
up
an
arm
like
a
beaten
schoolboy
and
began
to
blubbler
noisily
in
the
crook
of
his
elbow
an
ungentle
hand
on
his
shoulder
recalled
him
to
time
and
place
for
god
sake
what
the
matter
with
you
inquired
shade
voice
harshly
the
old
man
gulped
down
his
grief
and
made
his
communication
in
a
few
hurried
sentences
an
he
do
it
pap
concluded
he
jest
big
enough
fool
for
anything
ai
you
heard
of
his
scheme
for
having
the
hands
make
the
money
in
the
mill
thus
he
described
a
plan
you
know
he
given
ten
thousand
dollars
to
start
up
some
sort
o
school
for
the
boys
and
gals
to
learn
their
trade
in
a
man
like
that
do
anything
and
if
he
marries
johnnie
laurelly
leave
me
sure
leave
you
echoed
buckheath
darkly
she
wo
have
to
if
gray
stoddard
marries
johnnie
consadine
you
and
me
will
just
about
roost
in
the
penitentiary
for
the
rest
of
our
days
the
patent
echoed
pap
blankly
he
turned
fiercely
on
his
fellow
conspirator
now
see
what
ye
done
with
yer
foolishness
he
exclaimed
nothin
would
do
ye
but
to
be
offerin
the
contraption

and
tellin
each
and
every
that
hit

sulkily

patent

and
johnnie
cai
help

like
enough
he
hearn
of
that
silver
mine
and
that
the
reason
he
after
johnnie
the
old
man
paused
to
ruminate
on
this
feature
of
the
case
he
was
pleased
with
his
own
shrewdness
in
fathoming
gray
mysterious
motives
buck
he
said
finally
with
a
swift
drop
to
friendliness
hit
got
to
be
stopped
can
you
stop
it
did
you
tell
me
that
johnnie
promised
last
night
to
wed
you
you
say
she
promised
it
when
you
was
goin
up
to
the
victory
with
her
shade
nodded
she
promised
she
would
if
i
get
you
to
let
the
children
stay
out
of
the
mill
deanie

tongue
i
ca

johnnie
to
that
promise
but
but
there
one
person
i
want
to
talk
to
about
this
business
and
then
i
be
ready
to
do
something
chapter
xix
a
pact
while
himes
and
buckheath
yet
stood
thus
talking
the
warning
whistles
of
the
various
mills
began
to
blow
groups
of
girls
came
down
the
steps
and
stared
at
the
two
men
conferring
with
heads
close
together
mavity
bence
put
her
face
out
at
the
front
door
and
called
pap
yo
breakfast
is
gettin
stone
cold
do
you
have
to
go
to
the
mill
right
now
inquired
the
older
man
timorously
he
was
already
under
the
domination
of
this
swifter
bolder
more
fiery
spirit
no
i
do
have
to
go
anywhere
that
i
do
want
to
i
got
business
with
a
certain
party
up
and
when
i
git
to
the
mill
be
there
he
turned
and
hurried
swiftly
up
the
minor
slope
that
led
to
the
big
hardwick
home
pap
fascinated
eyes
following
him
as
long
as
he
was
in
sight
as
the
young
fellow
strode
along
he
was
turning
in
his
mind
lydia
sessions
promise
to
talk
to
him
this
morning
about
johnnie
but
she
be
in
bed
and
asleep
i
reckon
at
this
time
of
day
he
ruminated
the
good
lord
knows
i
would
if
i
had
the
chance
like
she
has
as
he
came
in
sight
of
the
hardwick
house
he
checked
momentarily
standing
at
the
gate
an
astonishing
figure
still
in
her
evening
frock
looking
haggard
and
old
in
the
gray
disillusioning
light
of
early
morning
was
lydia
sessions
upstairs
her
white
bed
was
smooth
its
pillows
spread
fair
and
prim
unpressed
by
any
head
since
the
maid
had
settled
them
trimly
in
place
the
morning
before
but
the
long
rug
which
ran
from
her
dressing
table
to
the
window
might
have
told
a
tale
of
pacing
feet
that
passed
restlessly
from
midnight
till
dawn
the
mirror
could
have
disclosed
the
picture
of
a
white
anxious
and
often
angry
face
that
had
stared
into
it
as
the
woman
paused
now
and
again
to
commune
with
the
real
lydia
sessions
she
was
thirty
and
penniless
she
belonged
to
a
circle
where
everybody
had
money
her
sister
had
married
well
and
harriet
was
no
than
she
all
lydia
sessions
considerable
forces
were
by
heredity
and
training
turned
into
one
narrow
channel
the
effort
to
make
a
creditable
if
not
a
brilliant
match
and
she
had
thought
she
was
succeeding
gray
stoddard
had
seemed
seriously
interested
in
those
long
night
watches
while
the
lights
flared
on
either
side
of
her
mirror
and
the
luxurious
room
of
a
modern
young
lady
lay
disclosed
with
all
its
sumptuous
fittings
of
beauty
and
inutility
lydia
went
over
her
plans
of
campaign
she
was
a
suitable
match
for
him
anybody
would
say
so
he
had
liked
her
he
had
liked
her
well
enough
till
he
got
interested
in
this
mill
girl
they
had
never
agreed
on
anything
concerning
johnnie
consadine
if
that
element
were
eliminated
she
knew
she
could
go
back
and
pick
up
the
thread
of
their
intimacy
which
had
promised
so
well
and
she
doubted
not
at
all
twist
it
safely
into
a
if
johnnie
were
only
out
of
the
way
if
she
would
leave
cottonville
if
she
would
marry
that
mechanic
who
plainly
wanted
her
how
silly
of
her
not
to
take
him
toward
dawn
she
snatched
a
little
cape
from
the
garments
hanging
in
the
closet
flung
it
over
her
shoulders
and
ran
downstairs
she
must
have
a
breath
of
fresh
air
so
in
the
manner
of
helpless
creatures
who
can
not
go
out
in
the
highway
to
accost
fate
she
was
standing
at
the
gate
when
she
caught
sight
of
shade
buckheath
approaching
here
was
her
opportunity
she
must
be
doing
something
and
the
nearest
enterprise
at
hand
was
to
foster
and
encourage
this
young
fellow
pursuit
of
johnnie
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
a
very
particular
matter
she
broke
out
nervously
as
soon
as
buckheath
was
near
enough
to
be
addressed
in
the
carefully
lowered
tone
which
she
used
throughout
the
interview
she
continually
huddled
the
light
cape
together
at
the
neck
with
tremulous
unsteady
fingers
and
it
was
characteristic
of
these
two
that
although
the
woman
had
heard
of
the
calamity
at
the
victory
mill
the
night
before
and
knew
that
shade
came
directly
from
the
himes
home
she
made
no
inquiry
as
to
the
welfare
of
deanie
and
he
offered
no
information
he
gave
no
reply
in
words
to
her
accost
and
she
went
on
with
increasing
agitation
i
this
matter
ought
to
be
attended
to
at
once
something
got
to
be
done
i
attempted
to
improve
the
social
and
spiritual
conditions
of
these
girls
in
the
mill
and
if
i
only
worked
harm
by
bringing
them
in
contact
with
in
contact
with
she
hesitated
and
stood
looking
into
the
man
face
buckheath
knew
exactly
what
she
wished
to
say
he
was
impatient
of
the
flummery
she
found
it
necessary
to
wind
around
her
simple
proposition
but
he
was
used
to
women
he
understood
them
and
to
him
a
woman
of
miss
class
was
no
different
from
a
woman
of
his
own
i
reckon
you
wanted
to
name
it
to
me
about
johnnie
consadine
he
said
bluntly
yes
yes
that
was
it
breathed
lydia
sessions
glancing
back
toward
the
house
with
a
frightened
air
john
is
she
a
good
girl
buckheath
i
beg
of
you
to
believe
me
when
i
assure
you
that
john
is
a
good
honest
upright
girl
i
would
not
think
anything
else
for
a
minute
but
it
seems
to
me
that
somebody
has
to
do
something
or
or
shade
raised
his
hand
to
his
mouth
to
conceal
the
swift
sarcastic
smile
on
his
lips
he
spat
toward
the
pathside
before
agreeing
seriously
with
miss
lydia
her
and
me
was
promised
before
she
come
down
here
and
got
all
this
foolishness
into
her
head
he
said
finally
her
mother
never
could
do
anything
with
johnnie
looks
like
johnnie
got
more
authority
her
mother
more
like
a
little
girl
to
her
than
the
other
way
round
her
uncle
pros
has
been
crazy
in
the
hospital
and
pap
himes
her
stepfather
well
i
reckon
she
the
only
human
that
ever
had
to
mind
pap
and
did
do
it
this
somewhat
ambiguous
statement
of
the
case
failed
to
bring
any
smile
to
his
hearer
lips
there
no
use
talking
to
john
herself
miss
lydia
took
up
the
tale
feverishly
i
done
that
and
it
had
no
effect
on
well
of
course
she
would
say
that
she
did
encourage
him
to
the
things
i
saw
afterward
but
i
know
that
a
man
of
his
sort
does
not
do
things
without
encouragement
and
buckheath
do
you
think
you
ought
to
go
right
to
stoddard
and
tell
him
that
john
is
your
promised
wife
and
show
him
the
folly
and
and
the
wickedness
of
his
course
or
what
would
be
wickedness
if
he
persisted
in
it
do
you
think
you
ought
to
do
that
shade
held
down
his
head
and
appeared
to
be
giving
this
matter
some
consideration
the
weak
point
of
such
an
argument
lay
in
the
fact
that
johnnie
was
not
his
promised
wife
and
gray
stoddard
was
very
likely
to
know
it
indeed
lydia
sessions
herself
only
believed
the
statement
because
she
so
wished
i
reckon
i
ort
he
said
finally
if
i
could
ever
get
a
chance
of
private
speech
with
him
mebbe
i
there
came
a
sound
of
light
hoofs
down
the
road
and
stoddard
on
roan
sultan
riding
bareheaded
came
toward
them
under
the
trees
miss
sessions
clutched
the
gate
and
stood
staring
buckheath
drew
a
little
closer
set
his
shoulder
against
the
fence
and
tried
to
look
unconcerned
the
rising
sun
behind
the
mountains
threw
long
slant
rays
across
into
the
bare
tree
tops
so
that
the
shimmer
of
it
dappled
horse
and
man
gray
face
was
pale
his
brow
looked
anxious
but
he
rode
head
up
and
alert
and
glanced
with
surprise
at
the
two
at
the
sessions
gate
he
had
no
hat
to
raise
but
he
saluted
lydia
sessions
with
a
sweeping
gesture
of
the
hand
and
passed
on
a
blithe
gallant
figure
cantering
along
the
suburban
road
out
toward
the
gap
and
the
mountains
beyond
gray
stoddard
rode
into
the
dip
of
the
ridge
and
so
far
as
cottonville
was
concerned
vanished
utterly
buckheath
drew
a
long
breath
and
straightened
up
i
but
a
poor
man
he
began
truculently
yit
there
ai
nobody
can
marry
the
gal
i
set
out
to
wed
and
me
stand
by
and
say
nothing
oh
mr
buckheath
cried
miss
lydia
stoddard
had
no
idea
of
john
a
mill
girl
there
is
no
possibility
of
any
such
thing
as
that
i
want
you
to
understand
that
there
is
to
feel
assured
once
for
all
i
have
reason
to
know
and
i
urge
you
to
put
that
out
of
your
mind
shade
looked
at
her
narrowly
up
to
the
time
pap
gave
him
definite
information
from
headquarters
he
had
never
for
an
instant
supposed
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
stoddard
desiring
to
marry
johnnie
but
the
flurried
eagerness
of
miss
sessions
convinced
him
that
such
a
possibility
was
a
very
present
dread
with
her
and
he
sent
a
venomous
glance
after
the
disappearing
horseman
you
go
and
talk
to
him
right
now
buckheath
insisted
lydia
anxiously
tell
him
just
as
you
have
told
me
how
long
you
and
john
have
been
engaged
and
how
devoted
she
was
to
you
before
she
came
down
to
the
mill
you
appeal
to
him
that
way
you
can
overtake
him
i
mean
you
can
intercept
him
if
you
start
right
on
now
cut
across
the
turn
and
go
through
the
tunnel
if
i
go
after
him
to
talk
to
him
and
we
uh
we
have
an
interruption
are
you
going
to
tell
everybody
you
see
about
it
demanded
shade
sharply
staring
down
at
the
woman
she
crouched
a
little
still
clinging
to
the
pickets
of
the
gate
the
word
interruption
only
conveyed
to
her
mind
the
suggestion
that
they
might
be
interfered
with
in
their
conversation
she
did
not
recollect
the
mountain
use
of
it
to
describe
a
quarrel
an
outbreak
or
an
affray
no
she
whispered
oh
certainly
not
i
never
tell
anything
that
you
do
want
me
to
all
right
returned
buckheath
hardily
if
you
wo
i
wo
if
you
name
to
people
that
i
was
the
last
one
saw
with
stoddard
i
shall
have
obliged
to
tell
of
what
you
and
me
was
talkin
about
when
he
passed
us
you
see
that
do
you
she
nodded
silently
her
frightened
eyes
on
his
face
and
without
another
word
he
set
off
at
that
long
swinging
pace
which
belongs
to
his
people
lydia
turned
and
ran
swiftly
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
to
her
own
room

missing
when
stoddard
did
not
come
to
his
desk
that
morning
the
matter
remained
for
a
time
unnoticed
except
by
mcpherson
who
fretted
a
bit
at
so
unusual
a
happening
truth
to
tell
the
old
scotchman
had
dreaded
having
this
rich
young
man
for
an
associate
and
had
put
a
rod
in
pickle
for
his
chastisement
when
stoddard
turned
out
to
be
a
regular
worker
punctual
amenable
to
discipline
he
congratulated
himself
and
praised
his
assistant
but
warily
now
came
the
first
delinquency
and
in
his
heart
he
cared
more
that
stoddard
should
absent
himself
without
notice
than
for
the
pile
of
letters
lying
untouched
dave
he
finally
said
to
the
yellow
office
boy
i
wish
you
to
stoddard
place
and
see
when
he
be
down
dave
came
back
with
the
information
that
stoddard
was
not
at
the
house
he
had
left
for
an
ride
and
not
returned
to
his
breakfast
he
just
about
have
stopped
up
at
the
country
club
for
a
snack
macpherson
muttered
to
himself
i
wonder
who
or
what
he
found
there
attractive
enough
to
keep
him
from
his
work
looking
into
gray
office
at
noon
the
closed
desk
with
its
pile
of
mail
once
more
offended
macpherson
eye
stoddard
here
inquired
hartley
sessions
glancing
in
at
the
same
moment
no
i
think
not
returned
the
scotchman
unwilling
to
admit
that
he
did
not
exactly
know
i
believe
he
up
at
the
club
perhaps
he
got
tangled
in
for
a
longer
game
of
golf
than
he
reckoned
on
this
unintentional
and
wholly
innocent
falsehood
stopped
any
inquiry
that
there
might
have
been
macpherson
had
meant
to
the
club
during
the
day
but
he
failed
to
do
so
and
it
was
not
until
evening
that
he
walked
up
himself
to
put
more
cautious
inquiries
no
sah
no
sah
gray
ai
been
here
the
negro
steward
told
him
promptly
i
sure
would
have
remembered
sah
in
answer
to
a
startled
inquiry
from
macpherson
dey
been
havin
a
big
game
on
between
charley
conroy
and
hardwick
and
de
bofe
of
spoke
of
gray
and
said
dey
was
expectin
him
to
play
macpherson
came
down
the
stone
steps
of
the
clubhouse
gravely
disquieted
below
him
the
road
wound
a
dimly
conjectured
wavering
gray
ribbon
on
the
other
side
of
it
the
steep
slope
took
off
to
a
gulf
of
inky
shadow
where
the
great
valley
lay
hushed
under
the
solemn
stars
silent
black
and
shimmering
with
a
myriad
pulsating
electric
lights
which
glowed
like
swarms
of
fireflies
caught
in
an
invisible
net
that
was
watauga
the
strings
of
brilliants
that
led
from
it
were
arc
lights
at
switch
crossings
where
the
great
railway
lines
rayed
out
near
at
hand
was
cottonville
with
its
vast
bulks
of
lighted
mills
whose
hum
came
faintly
up
to
him
even
at
this
distance
macpherson
stood
uncertainly
in
the
middle
of
the
road
supper
and
bed
were
behind
him
but
he
had
not
the
heart
to
turn
back
to
either
somewhere
down
in
that
abyss
of
night
there
was
a
clue
or
there
were
many
clues
to
this
strange
absence
of
gray
stoddard
perhaps
gray
himself
was
there
and
the
scotchman
cursed
his
own
dilatoriness
in
waiting
till
darkness
had
covered
the
earth
before
setting
afoot
inquiries
he
found
himself
hurrying
and
getting
out
of
breath
as
he
took
his
way
down
the
ridge
and
straight
to
stoddard
cottage
only
to
find
that
the
master
horse
was
not
in
the
stable
and
the
negro
boy
who
cared
for
it
had
seen
nothing
of
it
or
its
rider
since
five
that
morning
i
wonder
now
should
i
give
the
alarm
to
hardwick
macpherson
said
to
himself
the
lad
may
have
just
ridden
on
to
la
fayette
or
some
little
nearby
town
and
be
staying
the
night
young
fellows
sometimes
have
affairs
they
rather
not
share
with
everybody
and
then
there
miss
lydia
if
i
go
up
to
hardwick
with
the
story
she
be
sure
to
hear
it
from
hardwick
wife
did
stoddard
ever
go
away
like
this
before
without
giving
you
notice
he
asked
with
apparent
carelessness
the
boy
shook
his
head
in
vigorous
negative
never
since
i
been
working
for
him
he
asserted
stoddard
was
starting
anywhere
but
for
his
early
ride
at
least
he
intending
to
he
had
any
hat
on
and
he
was
in
his
riding
clothes
he
did
carry
anything
with
him
i
know
in
reason
he
was
intending
to
stay
this
information
sent
macpherson
hurrying
to
the
hardwick
home
dinner
was
over
the
master
of
the
house
conferred
with
him
a
moment
in
the
vestibule
then
opened
the
door
into
the
little
sitting
room
and
asked
abruptly
when
was
the
last
time
any
of
you
saw
gray
stoddard
his
screamed
faintly
then
cowered
in
her
chair
and
stared
at
him
mutely
but
hardwick
as
yet
noted
nothing
unusual
yesterday
evening
she
returned
placidly
do
you
remember
jerome
he
was
here
at
the
lyric
reception
oh
i
remember
well
enough
said
hardwick
knitting
his
brows
i
thought
some
of
you
might
have
seen
him
since
then
he
missing
missing
echoed
lydia
sessions
with
a
note
of
terror
in
her
tones
now
hardwick
looked
startled
but
jerome
i
think
you
inconsiderate
she
began
glancing
solicitously
at
her
sister
under
the
circumstances
it
seems
to
me
you
might
have
made
your
announcement
more
gently
to
lydia
anyhow
never
mind
dearie
there
nothing
in
it
to
be
frightened
at
i
not
frightened
whispered
lydia
sessions
through
white
lips
that
belied
her
assertion
hardwick
looked
impatiently
from
his
to
his
wife
i
sorry
if
i
startled
you
lydia
he
said
in
a
perfunctory
tone
but
this
is
a
serious
business
macpherson
tells
me
stoddard
been
at
the
factory
nor
at
his
the
last
person
who
saw
him
so
far
as
we
know
is
his
stable
boy
black
jim
says
stoddard
rode
out
of
the
gate
at
five
this
morning
bareheaded
and
in
his
riding
clothes
have
any
of
you
seen
him
since
that
what
i
want
to
know
since
repeated
miss
sessions
who
seemed
unable
to
get
beyond
the
parrot
echoing
of
her
questioner
words
why
jerome
what
makes
you
think
i
seen
him
since
then
did
he
say
did
anybody
tell
you
she
broke
off
huskily
and
sat
staring
at
her
interlaced
fingers
dropped
in
her
lap
no
no
of
course
not
lydia
her
sister
hastened
to
reassure
her
crossing
the
room
and
putting
a
protecting
arm
about
the
shoulders
he
should
have
spoken
as
he
did
knowing
that
you
and
gray
knowing
how
affairs
stand
well
i
only
thought
since
you
and
stoddard
are
such
great
friends
hardwick
persisted
he
might
have
mentioned
to
you
some
excursion
or
made
opportunity
to
talk
with
you
alone
sometime
last
night
to
to
say
something
did
he
tell
you
where
he
was
going
lydia
are
you
keeping
something
from
us
that
we
ought
to
know
remember
this
is
no
child
play
it
begins
to
look
as
though
it
might
be
a
question
of
the
man
life
lydia
sessions
started
galvanically
she
pushed
off
her
caressing
hand
with
a
fierce
gesture
there
nothing
no
such
relation
as
you
hinting
at
elizabeth
between
gray
stoddard
and
me
she
said
sharply
memory
of
what
gray
had
as
she
supposed
followed
her
into
the
library
to
say
to
her
wrung
a
sort
of
groan
from
the
girl
i
suppose
matilda
told
you
that
we
had
had
some
conversation
in
the
library
she
managed
to
say
her
shook
his
head
we
have
questioned
the
servants
yet
he
said
briefly
we
questioned
anybody
nor
hunted
up
any
evidence
macpherson
came
direct
to
me
from
stoddard
stable
boy
gray
did
stop
and
talk
to
you
last
night
what
did
he
say
i
why
nothing
in
i
really
do
remember
faltered
lydia
with
so
strange
a
look
that
both
her
sister
and
hardwick
looked
at
her
in
surprise
that
is
oh
nothing
of
any
importance
you
know
i
i
believe
we
were
talking
about
socialism
and
and
different
classes
of
people
that
sort
of
thing
macpherson
who
had
pushed
unceremoniously
into
the
room
behind
his
employer
nodded
his
gray
head
that
would
always
be
what
he
was
speaking
of
he
smiled
a
little
as
he
said
it
all
right
returned
hardwick
struggling
into
his
overcoat
at
the
and
seeking
his
hat
and
stick
i
go
right
back
with
you
mac
this
thing
somehow
has
a
sinister
look
to
me
as
the
two
men
were
leaving
the
house
hardwick
felt
a
light
trembling
touch
on
his
arm
and
turned
to
face
his
why
jerome
why
did
you
say
that
last
lydia
quavered
what
do
you
think
has
happened
to
him
do
you
think
anybody
that
is
oh
you
looked
at
me
as
though
you
thought
i
had
something
to
do
with
it
come
come
lyd
pull
yourself
together
you
getting
hysterical
urged
hardwick
kindly
then
he
turned
to
macpherson
as
the
two
men
went
companionably
down
the
walk
and
out
into
the
street
the
scotchman
said
apologetically
of
course
i
knew
miss
lydia
would
be
alarmed
i
understand
about
her
and
stoddard
it
made
me
hesitate
a
while
before
coming
up
to
you
folks
with
the
thing
well
by
the
lord
you
did
well
not
to
hesitate
too
long
mac
ejaculated
hardwick
i
should
feel
the
anxiety
i
do
if
we
been
having
trouble
with
those
mountain
people
up
toward
flat
rock
over
that
girl
that
died
at
the
hospital
he
laughed
a
little
ruefully
trying
to
do
things
for
folks
is
ticklish
business
there
was
a
man
in
the
crowd
that
interviewed
me
whom
i
could
convince
that
our
hospital
was
a
factory
for
the
making
of
stiffs
which
we
sold
to
the
northern
medical
college
oh
it
was
gruesome
i
told
them
the
girl
had
had
every
attention
and
that
she
died
of
pernicious
anaemia
they
called
it
big
dic
word
and
asked
me
point
blank
if
the
girl
had
been
killed
in
the
mill
i
told
them
that
we
could
keep
the
body
indefinitely
and
they
said
they
to
come
and
haul
it
away
as
soon
as
they
could
get
a
horse
and
wagon
i
called
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
could
know
this
unless
they
wrote
and
told
me
so
in
answer
to
my
letter
but
between
you
and
me
mac
i
do
believe
there
was
a
man
in
the
crowd
who
could
read
or
write
for
god
sake
exclaimed
the
scotchman
you
do
think
people
were
up
to
doing
a
mischief
to
stoddard
do
you
i
do
know
what
to
think
protested
hardwick
yes
they
are
mediaeval
half
savage
the
fact
is
i
have
no
idea
what
they
would
or
what
they
would
do
macpherson
gave
a
whistle
of
dismay
gad
it
sounds
like
the
manoeuvres
of
one
of
our
highland
clans
three
hundred
years
ago
he
said
would
it
be
the
irony
of
fate
that
stoddard
poor
fellow
a
friend
of
the
people
a
socialist
ready
to
call
every
man
his
brother
should
be
sacrificed
in
such
a
way
the
words
brought
them
to
stoddard
little
home
silent
and
deserted
now
down
the
street
the
lamps
flared
gustily
it
was
after
eleven
where
does
that
boy
live
that
takes
care
of
the
horses
black
jim
hardwick
inquired
after
they
had
rung
the
bell
thumped
on
the
door
and
called
to
make
sure
the
master
had
not
returned
during
macpherson
absence
i
do
know
really
i
do
know
he
might
have
a
room
over
the
stable
macpherson
suggested
but
the
stable
proved
to
be
a
affair
and
they
were
just
turning
to
leave
when
a
stamping
sound
within
arrested
their
notice
good
god
what
that
ejaculated
macpherson
whose
nerves
were
quivering
it
the
horse
answered
hardwick
in
a
relieved
tone
stoddard
got
back
of
course
broke
in
old
macpherson
quickly
and
gone
over
to
gandish
for
some
supper
that
is
why
he
was
in
the
house
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
they
opened
the
unlocked
stable
door
and
macpherson
struck
a
match
the
roan
turned
and
whinnied
hungrily
at
sight
of
them
that
funny
said
hardwick
scarcely
above
his
breath
it
looks
to
me
as
though
that
animal
had
been
fed
in
the
flare
of
the
match
macpherson
had
descried
the
stable
lantern
hanging
on
the
wall
they
lit
this
and
examined
the
stall
there
was
no
feed
in
the
box
no
hay
in
the
manger
the
saddle
was
on
gray
horse
the
bit
in
his
mouth
he
was
tied
by
the
reins
to
his
stall
ring
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
with
lengthening
faces
stoddard
too
good
a
horseman
to
have
done
that
spoke
hardwick
slowly
and
too
kind
a
man
supplied
macpherson
loyally
he
have
seen
to
the
beast
hunger
before
he
satisfied
his
own
as
the
scotchman
spoke
he
was
picking
up
the
horse
hoofs
and
digging
at
them
with
a
bit
of
stick
they
as
clean
as
if
they
just
been
washed
he
said
as
he
straightened
up
by
heaven
i
have
it
hardwick
that
fellow
came
into
town
with
his
hoofs
muffled
the
younger
man
looked
also
and
assented
mutely
then
suggested
he
has
come
far
there
not
a
hair
turned
on
him
the
scotchman
shook
his
head
i
not
sure
of
that
he
debated
likely
he
been
led
and
that
slowly
god
this
is
horrible
mechanically
hardwick
got
some
hay
down
for
the
horse
while
macpherson
pulled
off
the
saddle
and
bridle
examining
both
in
the
process
grain
was
poured
into
the
box
and
then
water
offered
he
wo
drink
murmured
the
scotchman
d
see
hardwick
he
drink
you
ca
come
into
cottonville
without
crossing
a
stream
this
fellow
hoofs
have
been
wet
within
an
hour
yes
within
the
as
their
eyes
encountered
hardwick
caught
his
breath
sharply
both
felt
that
chill
of
the
cuticle
that
stirring
at
the
roots
of
the
hair
that
marks
the
passing
close
to
us
of
some
sinister
thing
stark
murder
or
man
naked
hatred
walking
in
the
dark
beside
our
cheerful
commonplace
path
by
one
consent
they
turned
back
from
the
stable
and
went
together
to
gandish
the
house
was
dark
of
course
you
know
i
do
expect
to
find
him
here
said
hardwick
i
do
suppose
they
know
anything
about
the
matter
but
we
got
to
wake
them
and
ask
they
did
so
and
set
trembling
the
first
wave
of
that
widening
ring
of
horror
which
finally
informed
the
remotest
boundaries
of
the
little
village
that
a
man
from
their
midst
was
mysteriously
missing
the
morning
found
the
telegraph
in
active
requisition
flashing
up
and
down
all
lines
by
which
a
man
might
have
left
cottonville
or
watauga
the
police
of
the
latter
place
were
notified
furnished
with
information
and
set
to
find
out
if
possible
whether
anybody
in
the
city
had
seen
stoddard
since
he
rode
away
on
friday
morning
the
inquiries
were
fruitless
a
young
lady
visiting
in
the
city
had
promised
him
a
dance
at
the
valentine
masque
to
be
held
at
the
country
friday
night
some
clothing
put
out
a
few
days
before
to
be
cleaned
and
pressed
was
ready
for
delivery
his
laundry
came
home
his
mail
arrived
punctually
the
postmaster
stated
that
he
had
no
instructions
for
a
change
of
address
all
the
little
accessories
of
gray
stoddard
life
offered
themselves
mute
impressive
witnesses
that
he
had
intended
to
go
on
with
it
in
cottonville
but
stoddard
himself
had
dropped
as
completely
out
of
the
knowledge
of
man
as
though
he
had
been
whisked
off
the
planet
chapter
xxi
the
search
the
fruitless
search
was
vigorously
prosecuted
on
saturday
the
hardwick
mill
ran
while
nearly
half
its
male
employees
made
some
effort
to
solve
the
mystery
parties
combed
again
and
again
the
nearer
mountains
sunday
all
the
mill
operatives
were
free
and
then
groups
of
women
and
children
added
themselves
to
the
men
dinners
were
taken
along
lending
a
grotesque
suggestion
of
picnicking
to
the
work
a
suggestion
contradicted
by
the
anxious
faces
the
strained
timbre
of
the
voices
that
called
from
group
to
group
but
night
brought
the
amateur
searchers
straggling
home
with
nothing
to
tell
it
should
have
been
significant
to
any
one
who
knew
the
mountain
people
that
information
concerning
gray
stoddard
within
a
week
of
his
disappearance
was
noticeably
lacking
nobody
would
admit
that
his
had
been
a
familiar
figure
on
those
roads
at
the
utmost
they
had
seed
him
a
good
deal
a
while
ago
but
he
sorter
quit
riding
up
of
late
but
on
no
road
could
there
be
found
man
woman
or
child
who
had
seen
gray
stoddard
riding
friday
morning
on
his
roan
horse
the
whole
outlying
district
seemed
to
be
in
a
conspiracy
of
silence
in
watauga
and
in
cottonville
itself
clues
were
found
by
the
police
followed
up
and
proved
worthless
all
gray
eastern
connections
were
immediately
communicated
with
by
telegraph
in
the
forlorn
hope
of
finding
some
internal
clue
the
business
men
in
charge
of
his
large
eastern
interests
answered
promptly
that
nothing
from
recent
correspondence
with
him
pointed
to
any
intention
on
his
part
of
making
a
journey
or
otherwise
changing
his
ordinary
way
of
living
they
added
urgent
admonitions
to
macpherson
to
have
locked
up
in
the
safe
various
important
papers
which
they
had
sent
at
request
for
signature
and
which
they
supposed
from
the
date
must
be
lying
with
his
other
mail
a
boyhood
friend
telegraphed
his
intention
of
coming
down
from
massachusetts
and
joining
the
searchers
stoddard
had
no
near
relatives
a
living
in
boston
telegraphed
to
hardwick
to
see
that
money
be
spent
freely
meantime
there
was
reason
for
johnnie
consadine
shut
in
the
little
sister
sick
room
day
and
night
to
hear
nothing
of
these
matters
lissy
had
been
allowed
to
help
wait
upon
the
injured
child
only
on
promise
that
nothing
exciting
should
be
mentioned
both
boys
had
instantly
begged
to
join
a
searching
party
milo
insisting
that
he
could
work
all
night
and
search
all
day
and
that
nobody
should
complain
that
he
neglected
his
job
pony
being
refused
had
run
away
milo
the
rulable
followed
to
get
him
to
return
and
by
sunday
night
mavity
was
feeding
both
boys
from
the
back
door
and
keeping
them
out
of
sight
of
pap
vengeance
considering
that
johnnie
had
trouble
enough
she
cautioned
everybody
on
the
place
to
say
nothing
of
these
matters
to
the
girl
mandy
a
feeble
unsound
creature
at
best
was
more
severely
injured
than
had
been
thought
she
was
confined
to
her
bed
for
days
pap
went
about
somewhat
like
a
whipped
dog
spoke
little
on
any
subject
and
tolerated
no
mention
of
the
topic
of
the
day
in
cottonville
his
face
kept
the
boarders
quiet
at
table
and
in
the
house
anyhow
shade
buckheath
never
entered
the
place
after
deanie
was
carried
in
from
the
hastily
summoned
carriage
thursday
night
the
doctors
told
them
that
if
deanie
survived
the
shock
and
its
violent
reaction
she
had
a
fair
chance
of
recovery
they
found
at
once
that
she
was
not
internally
injured
the
blood
that
had
been
seen
came
only
from
a
cut
lip
but
the
child
left
arm
was
broken
the
small
body
was
dreadfully
bruised
and
the
terror
had
left
a
profound
mental
disturbance
nothing
but
quiet
and
careful
nursing
offered
any
good
hope
while
there
was
the
menace
that
she
would
never
be
strong
again
and
might
not
live
to
womanhood
at
first
she
lay
with
glazed
eyes
barely
breathing
a
ghastly
sight
then
when
she
roused
a
bit
she
wanted
not
lissy
not
even
johnnie
she
called
for
her
mother
when
her
child
was
brought
home
to
her
dying
as
they
all
thought
laurella
had
rallied
her
forces
and
got
up
from
the
pallet
on
which
she
lay
to
tend
on
the
little
thing
but
she
broke
down
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
and
seemed
about
to
add
another
patient
to
johnnie
cares
yet
when
the
paroxysms
of
terror
shook
the
emaciated
frame
and
the
others
attempted
to
reassure
deanie
by
words
it
was
her
mother
who
called
for
a
bit
of
gay
calico
for
scissors
and
needle
and
thread
and
began
dressing
a
doll
in
the
little
sufferer
sight
laurella
had
carried
unspoiled
the
faculty
for
play
up
with
her
through
the
years
let
her
be
the
doctor
counselled
johnnie
in
reply
to
anxious
inquiries
do
you
see
she
getting
the
child
attention
the
baby
notices
an
ounce
of
happiness
is
worth
a
pound
of
any
medicine
i
could
bring
and
so
when
laurella
could
no
longer
sit
up
they
brought
another
cot
for
her
and
she
lay
all
day
babbling
childish
nonsense
and
playing
dolls
within
of
the
while
johnnie
with
help
tended
on
them
both
you
got
two
babies
now
you
big
old
solemn
johnnie
laurella
said
with
a
ghost
of
her
sparkling
smile
deanie
and
me
is
just
of
one
age
and
that
a
fact
if
pap
wanted
to
see
his
young
wife
and
thirst
for
a
sight
of
her
was
a
continual
craving
with
him
she
was
the
light
of
the
old
eyes
he
had
to
go
in
and
look
on
the
child
he
had
injured
this
kept
him
away
pretty
effectually
after
that
first
fiery
scene
when
laurella
had
flown
at
him
like
a
fierce
little
vixen
and
told
him
that
she
never
wanted
to
see
his
face
again
that
she
rued
the
day
she
married
him
and
intended
to
leave
him
as
soon
as
she
could
put
foot
to
the
ground
in
the
gray
dawn
of
monday
morning
when
johnnie
was
downstairs
eating
her
bit
of
early
breakfast
pap
shambled
in
to
make
laurella
fire
having
got
the
hickory
wood
to
blazing
he
sat
humped
and
by
the
bedside
a
while
whispering
to
his
wife
and
holding
her
hand
a
sight
for
the
student
of
man
to
marvel
at
he
had
brought
a
paper
of
coarse
cheap
candy
for
deanie
but
the
child
was
asleep
the
offering
was
quite
as
acceptable
to
laurella
and
she
nibbled
a
stick
as
she
listened
to
him
the
bald
head
with
its
little
fringe
of
grizzled
curls
bent
close
to
the
dark
mutinous
countenance
pap
whispered
hoarsely
for
some
time
laurella
replying
at
first
in
a
sort
of
languid
tolerance
but
presently
with
little
ejaculations
of
wonder
and
dismay
a
step
on
the
stair
which
he
took
to
be
johnnie
put
himes
to
instant
flight
i
got
to
go
honey
he
breathed
huskily
cai
you
say
you
forgive
me
before
i
leave
i
know
i
ai
fitten
fer
the
likes
of
you
but
when

here

i
to
take
some
money
out
of
the
bank
and
git
you
whatever
you
want
see
what
done
and
he
showed
a
little
book
in
his
hand
and
what
he
had
written
in
it
oh
i
forgive
you
if
that
any
account
to
you
returned
laurella
with
kindly
contempt
i
never
noticed
that
forgiving
things
undid
the
harm
any
but
yes
oh
of
course
i
forgive
you
go
along
i
tired
now

bother
me
any
more
gid
i

the
old
man
thrust
the
treasured
bankbook
under
laurella
pillow
and
hurried
away
downstairs
in
the
dining
room
johnnie
was
eating
her
breakfast
johnnie
said
mavity
bence
keeping
behind
the
girl
chair

she
served
the
meal

the
long
table

johnnie
wonderingly
trying
to
get
sight
of
the
older
woman
face
bence
took
a
plate
and
hurried
out
for
more
biscuits
she
came
back
with
some
resolution
plainly
renewed
in
her
mind
johnnie
she
began
once
more
there
something

always

then
pap
he
she
broke
off
and
stood
silent
so
long
that
johnnie
turned
and
looked
at
her
surely
you
are
afraid
of
me
aunt
mavity
she
said
finally
no

mavity
bence
in
a
low
voice
but
i
scared

the
others
the
girl
stared
at
her
curiously
johnnie
burst
out
the
woman
for
the
third
time
yo
uncle
pros
found
his
silver
mine

mavity

to

mine

or
thought
he

and
he
come
out
and
talked
loud
and
grabbed
for
the
bandanner
and
he
missed

back
to
mother
now
laurella
had
said
to
pap
himes
that
she
wanted
to
sleep
and
indeed
her
eyes
were
closed
when
johnnie
entered
the
room
but
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
sweeping
lashes
burned
such
spots
of
crimson
that
her
nurse
was
alarmed
what
was
pap
himes
saying
to
you
to
get
you
so
excited
she
asked
anxiously
johnnie
come
here
sit
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
listen
to
me
demanded
laurella
feverishly
she
laid
hold
of
her
daughter
arm
and
half
pulled
herself
up
by
it
staring
into
johnnie
face
as
she
talked
and
out
tumbled
the
whole
story
of
gray
stoddard
disappearance
as
full
understanding
of
what
her
mother
said
came
home
to
johnnie
her
eyes
dilated
in
her
pale
face
she
sank
to
her
knees
beside
the
bed
lost

echoed

johnnie
sprang
to
her
feet
in
dismay
and
stood
staring
a
moment
then
swiftly
she
bent
once
more
over
the
little
woman
in
the
bed
mother
she
said
before
laurella

speak
or
answer

johnnie
laurella
put
in
eagerly
she
tugged
at
a
corner
of
the
pillow
fumbled
thereunder
with
her
little
brown
hand
and
dragging
out
pap
himes
bankbook
showed
it
to
her
daughter
opening
at
that
front
page
where
pap
clumsy
characters
made
laurella
himes
free
of
all
his
savings

johnnie
stooped
and
kissed
the
cheek
with
its
feverish
flush
mommie
she
whispered
hurriedly
do
worry
about
me
be
back
well
do
worry
she
snatched
a
coat
and
hat
and
going
out
closed
the
door
quietly
behind
her
she
stepped
out
into
the
dancing
sunlight
of
an
early
spring
morning
the
leafless
vine
on
mavity
bence
porch
rattled
dry
stems
against
the
lattice
work
in
a
gay
march
wind
taking
counsel
with
herself
for
a
moment
she
started
swiftly
down
the
street
in
the
direction
of
the
mills
in
the
office
they
told
her
that
hardwick
had
gone
to
nashville
to
see
about
getting
bloodhounds
macpherson
was
following
his
own
plan
of
search
in
watauga
she
was
permitted
to
go
down
into
the
mechanical
department
and
ask
the
head
of
it
about
shade
buckheath
no
he
ai
here
ramsey
told
her
promptly
we
running
so
that
i
do
know
how
to
get
along
and
if
i
try
to
get
an
extra
man
i
find
he
out
with
the
searchers
i
sent
up
for
himes
yesterday
but
him
and
buckheath
was
to
go
together
taking
stoddard
car
so
as
to
get
further
up
into
the
unakas
johnnie
felt
as
though
the
blood
receded
from
her
face
and
gathered
all
about
a
heart
which
beat
to
suffocation
for
a
wild
moment
she
had
an
impulse
to
denounce
buckheath
and
her
stepfather
but
almost
instantly
she
realized
that
she
would
weaken
her
cause
and
lose
all
chance
of
assistance
by
doing
so
her
standing
in
the
mill
was
excellent
and
as
she
ran
up
the
stairs
she
was
going
over
in
her
mind
the
persons
to
whom
she
might
take
her
story
she
found
no
one
from
whom
she
dared
expect
credence
and
help
out
in
the
street
again
she
caught
sight
of
charlie
conroy
and
her
thoughts
were
turned
by
a
natural
association
of
ideas
to
lydia
sessions
that
was
it
why
had
it
not
occurred
to
her
before
she
hurried
up
the
long
hill
to
the
hardwick
home
and
trying
first
the
bell
at
the
front
where
she
got
no
reply
skirted
the
house
and
rapped
long
and
loudly
at
the
side
door
harriet
hardwick
when
things
began
to
wear
a
tragic
complexion
had
promptly
packed
her
wardrobe
and
her
children
and
flitted
to
watauga
this
hegira
was
undertaken
mainly
to
get
her
sister
away
from
the
scene
of
gray
stoddard
disappearance
yet
when
the
move
came
to
be
made
miss
sessions
refused
to
accompany
her
sister
i
ca
go
she
repeated
fiercely
i
stay
here
and
keep
house
for
jerome
then
if
there
comes
any
news
i
be
where
oh
do
look
at
me
that
way
i
wish
you
go
on
and
let
me
alone
yes
yes
yes
it
is
better
for
you
to
go
to
watauga
and
leave
me
here
ever
since
her
opened
the
door
of
the
sitting
room
and
announced
to
the
family
gray
stoddard
disappearance
lydia
sessions
had
been
as
it
were
a
woman
at
war
with
herself
her
first
impulse
was
of
decorum
to
jerk
her
skirts
about
her
in
seemly
fashion
and
be
certain
that
no
smirch
adhered
to
them
then
she
began
to
wonder
if
she
could
find
shade
buckheath
and
discover
from
him
the
truth
of
the
matter
whenever
she
would
have
made
a
movement
toward
this
she
winced
away
from
what
she
knew
he
would
say
to
her
she
flinched
even
from
finding
out
that
her
fears
were
well
grounded
as
matters
began
to
wear
a
more
serious
face
she
debated
now
and
again
telling
her
of
her
suspicions
that
buckheath
had
a
grudge
against
stoddard
but
if
she
said
this
how
account
for
the
knowledge
how
explain
to
jerome
why
she
had
denied
seeing
stoddard
friday
morning
jerome
was
so
terribly
practical
he
would
ask
such
searching
questions
back
of
it
all
there
was
truly
much
remorse
and
terrible
anxiety
for
stoddard
himself
but
this
was
continually
swallowed
up
in
her
concern
for
her
own
welfare
her
own
good
name
always
after
she
had
agonized
so
much
there
would
come
with
a
revulsion
a
gust
of
anger
stoddard
had
never
cared
for
her
he
had
been
cruel
in
his
attitude
of
kindness
let
him
take
what
followed
cottonville
was
a
town
distraught
and
the
hardwick
servants
had
seized
the
occasion
to
run
out
for
a
bit
of
delectable
gossip
in
which
the
least
of
the
horrors
included
gray
stoddard
murdered
and
mutilated
body
washed
down
in
some
mountain
stream
to
the
sight
of
his
friends
johnnie
was
too
urgent
to
long
delay
getting
no
answer
at
the
side
door
she
pushed
it
open
and
ventured
through
silent
room
after
room
until
she
came
to
the
stairway
and
so
on
up
to
miss
sessions
bedroom
door
she
had
been
there
before
and
fearing
to
alarm
by
knocking
she
finally
called
out
in
what
she
tried
to
make
a
normal
reassuring
tone
it
only
me
johnnie
consadine
miss
lydia
the
answer
was
a
hasty
muffled
outcry
somebody
who
had
been
kneeling
by
the
bed
on
the
further
side
of
the
room
sprang
up
and
came
forward
showing
a
face
so
disfigured
by
tears
and
anxiety
by
loss
of
sleep
and
lack
of
food
as
to
be
scarcely
recognizable
that
ravaged
visage
told
plainly
the
that
lydia
sessions
narrow
soul
had
become
in
these
dreadful
days
she
knew
now
that
she
had
set
shade
buckheath
to
quarrel
with
gray
stoddard
and
gray
had
never
been
seen
since
the
hour
she
sent
the
dangerous
unscrupulous
man
after
him
to
that
quarrel
with
this
knowledge
wrestled
and
fought
the
instinct
we
strive
to
develop
in
our
girl
children
the
fear
we
brand
shamefully
into
their
natures
her
name
must
not
be
connected
with
such
an
affair
she
must
not
be
talked
about
have
they
found
him
lydia
gasped
is
he
alive
johnnie
generous
soul
even
in
the
intense
preoccupation
of
her
own
pain
could
pity
the
woman
who
looked
and
spoke
thus
no
she
answered
they
have
found
him
and
some
that
are
looking
for
him
never
will
find
him
oh
miss
lydia
i
want
you
to
help
me
make
them
send
somebody
that
we
can
trust
up
the
gap
road
and
on
to
the
unakas
miss
sessions
flinched
plainly
what
do
you
know
about
it
she
inquired
in
a
voice
which
shook
still
staring
at
johnnie
she
moved
back
toward
her
bedroom
door
why
should
you
mention
the
gap
road
what
makes
you
think
he
went
up
in
the
unakas
i
do
know
that
he
went
there
hesitated
johnnie
but
i
do
know
who
you
got
to
find
before
you
can
find
him
oh
get
somebody
to
go
with
me
and
help
me
before
it
too
late
i
she
hesitated
i
thought
maybe
we
could
get
your
brother
hartley
car
i
could
run
it
i
could
run
a
car
the
bitterness
that
had
racked
lydia
sessions
heart
for
more
than
hours
culminated
she
had
been
instrumental
in
putting
gray
stoddard
in
mortal
danger
and
now
if
he
was
to
be
helped
assistance
would
come
through
johnnie
consadine
it
was
more
than
she
could
bear
i
do
believe
it
she
gasped
you
know
who
to
find
you
just
getting
up
this
story
to
be
noticed
you
always
doing
things
to
attract
attention
to
yourself
you
want
to
go
riding
around
in
an
automobile
and
and
stoddard
has
probably
gone
in
to
watauga
and
taken
the
midnight
train
for
boston
this
looking
around
in
the
mountains
is
folly
who
would
want
to
harm
him
in
the
mountains
for
a
moment
johnnie
stood
thwarted
and
the
insults
directed
toward
herself
made
almost
no
impression
on
her
strangely
as
they
came
from
lydia
sessions
lips
she
was
too
intent
on
her
own
purpose
to
care
greatly
shade
buckheath
she
began
cautiously
intending
only
to
state
that
shade
had
taken
stoddard
car
but
lydia
sessions
drew
back
with
a
scream
it
a
lie
she
cried
there
is
a
word
of
truth
in
what
you
say
john
consadine
oh
you
the
plague
of
my
life
you
have
been
from
the
first
you
follow
me
about
and
torment
me
shade
buckheath
had
nothing
to
do
with
gray
stoddard
disappearance
i
tell
you
nothing
nothing
nothing
she
thrust
forward
her
face
and
sent
forth
the
words
with
incredible
vehemence
but
her
tirade
kindled
in
johnnie
no
heat
of
personal
anger
she
stood
looking
intently
at
the
frantic
woman
before
her
slowly
a
light
of
comprehension
dawned
in
her
eyes
shade
buckheath
had
everything
to
do
with
gray
disappearance
you
know
it
that
what
ails
you
now
you
you
must
have
been
there
when
they
quarrelled
they
did
quarrel
they
did
protested
miss
lydia
with
a
yet
more
hysteric
emphasis
they
did
even
speak
to
each
other
stoddard
said
morning
to
me
and
rode
right
past
johnnie
leant
forward
and
with
a
sudden
sweeping
movement
caught
the
other
woman
by
the
wrist
looking
deep
into
her
eyes
lydia
she
said
accusingly
and
neither
of
them
noticed
the
freedom
of
the
address
you
did
tell
the
truth
when
you
said
you
had
seen
gray
since
friday
night
you
saw
him
friday
morning
you
have
both
lied
about
it
god
knows
why
now
shade
and
my
stepfather
have
taken
poor
gray
car
and
gone
up
into
the
mountains
do
you
think
they
went
for
the
blazing
young
eyes
were
on
miss
sessions
tortured
countenance
oh
do
let
those
men
get
at
gray
they
murder
him
sobbed
the
older
woman
sinking
once
more
to
her
knees
johnnie
i
always
been
good
to
you
have
i
you
go
and
tell
them
that
say
that
shade
buckheath
that
somebody
ought
to
she
broke
off
abruptly
and
sprang
up
like
a
suddenly
goaded
creature
no
i
wo
she
cried
out
you
need
ask
it
of
me
i
will
not
tell
about
seeing
stoddard
friday
morning
i
promised
not
to
and
it
ca
do
any
good
anyhow
if
you
set
them
at
me
i
deny
it
and
tell
them
you
made
up
the
story
i
will
i
will
i
will
and
she
ran
into
her
room
once
more
and
threw
herself
down
beside
the
bed
johnnie
turned
contemptuously
and
left
the
woman
babbling
incoherencies
on
her
knees
evidently
preparing
to
pray
to
a
god
whose
laws
she
was
determined
to
break
chapter
xxii
the
atlas
vertebra
johnnie
hurried
downstairs
in
a
mental
turmoil
out
of
which
there
swiftly
formed
itself
the
resolution
to
go
herself
and
if
possible
overtake
or
find
shade
and
her
stepfather
word
must
first
be
sent
to
her
mother
she
was
glad
to
remember
that
little
bankbook
under
laurella
pillow
mavity
and
mandy
would
tend
the
invalids
well
helped
by
little
lissy
and
with
money
available
she
was
sure
they
would
be
allowed
to
lack
for
nothing
she
crossed
the
hall
swiftly
meaning
to
go
past
the
little
grocery
where
they
bought
their
supplies
and
telephone
mavity
that
she
might
be
away
for
several
days
but
near
the
side
door
she
noted
the
hardwick
telephone
and
hesitated
a
moment
people
would
hear
her
down
at
mayfield
already
she
began
to
have
a
terror
of
being
watched
or
followed
hesitatingly
she
took
down
the
receiver
and
asked
for
connection
at
the
little
tinkle
of
the
bell
there
was
a
swift
light
rush
above
stairs
mahala
screamed
miss
sessions
voice
over
the
banisters
thinking
the
maid
was
below
stairs
answer
that
telephone
she
heard
johnnie
move
and
added
tell
everybody
that
i
ca
be
seen
if
it
anything
about
stoddard
say
that
i
sick
utterly
prostrated
and
ca
be
talked
to
she
turned
from
the
stairway
ran
back
into
her
own
room
and
shut
and
locked
the
door
and
at
that
moment
johnnie
heard
mavity
bence
voice
replying
to
her
aunt
mavity
she
began
this
is
johnnie
i
up
at
now
uncle
pros
is
out
in
the
mountains
and
i
going
to
look
for
him
i
rather
not
have
anybody
know
i
gone
do
you
understand
that
try
to
keep
it
from
the
boarders
and
the
children
you
and
mandy
are
the
only
ones
that
would
have
to
know
yes
honey
yes
johnnie
came
the
eager
humble
reply
i
do
just
like
you
say
sha
nobody
find
out
from
me
johnnie
there
was
a
pause
johnnie
pap
and
shade
did
get
off
as
soon
as
they
expected
something
was
the
matter
with
the
machine
i
believe
they
ai
been
gone
to
exceed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
i
thought
maybe
you
like
to
know
thank
you
aunt
mavity
said
johnnie
yes
i
glad
you
told
me
she
understood
what
a
struggle
the
kind
soul
had
had
with
her
weakness
and
timidity
ere
for
loyalty
sake
she
was
able
to
make
the
disclosure
i
may
not
be
back
for
two
or
three
days
do
worry
about
me
i
be
all
right
mother
got
money
you
buy
what
she
and
deanie
need
and
do
work
too
hard
she
hung
up
the
receiver
went
out
the
side
door
and
reaching
the
main
street
struck
straight
for
the
gap
holding
the
big
road
for
the
unakas
to
her
left
was
the
white
highway
that
ran
along
above
the
valley
and
that
palace
of
pleasure
which
had
seemed
a
wonder
and
a
mystery
to
her
one
year
gone
she
gave
no
thought
to
the
sight
of
river
and
valley
and
town
except
to
look
back
once
at
the
roofs
and
reflect
that
among
all
the
people
housed
there
in
sight
of
her
there
were
surely
those
who
knew
the
secret
of
gray
disappearance
who
could
tell
her
if
they
would
where
to
search
for
him
somehow
the
thought
made
her
feel
very
small
and
alone
and
unfriended
with
its
discouragement
came
that
dogged
persistence
that
was
characteristic
of
the
girl
she
set
her
trembling
lip
and
went
over
her
plans
resolutely
methodically
deanie
and
laurella
were
safe
to
be
well
looked
after
in
her
absence
mavity
bence
and
mandy
would
care
for
them
tenderly
and
there
was
the
bankbook
if
johnnie
knew
her
mother
the
household
back
there
would
not
lack
either
for
assistance
or
material
matters
and
now
the
present
enterprise
began
to
shape
itself
in
her
mind
a
practical
creature
she
depended
from
the
first
on
getting
a
lift
from
time
to
time
yet
johnnie
knew
better
than
another
the
vast
silent
secret
network
of
hate
that
draws
about
the
victim
in
a
mountain
vendetta
if
the
spirit
of
feud
was
aroused
against
the
mill
owners
if
the
groners
and
dawsons
had
been
able
to
enlist
their
kin
and
clan
she
was
well
aware
that
the
man
or
woman
who
gave
her
smiling
information
as
to
ways
and
means
might
the
hour
before
have
looked
on
gray
stoddard
lying
dead
or
sat
in
the
council
which
planned
to
kill
him
thus
she
walked
warily
and
dared
ask
from
none
directions
or
help
she
was
not
yet
in
her
own
region
these
lower
ridges
lying
between
two
lines
of
railway
which
from
the
mountaineer
point
of
view
contaminated
them
and
gave
them
a
tincture
of
the
valley
and
the
settlement
noon
came
and
passed
she
was
very
weary
factory
life
had
told
on
her
physically
and
the
recent
distress
of
mind
added
its
devitalizing
influence
there
was
a
desperate
flagging
of
the
muscles
weakened
by
disuse
and
an
unhealthy
indoor
life
i
wonder
can
i
ever
make
it
she
questioned
herself
then
swiftly
i
got
to
i
got
to
her
eye
roved
toward
a
cabin
on
the
slope
above
there
lived
a
man
by
the
name
of
straley
but
he
was
a
cousin
to
lura
dawson
the
girl
who
had
died
in
the
hospital
johnnie
knew
him
to
be
one
of
the
bitterest
enemies
of
the
cottonville
mill
owners
and
realized
that
he
would
be
the
last
one
to
whom
she
should
apply
mutely
doggedly
she
pressed
on
and
rounding
a
bend
in
a
long
lonely
stretch
of
road
saw
before
her
the
tall
lithe
form
of
a
man
trousers
tucked
into
boots
a
tall
staff
in
hand
making
swift
progress
up
the
road
the
sound
of
feet
evidently
arrested
the
attention
of
the
wayfarer
he
turned
and
waited
for
her
to
come
up
the
figure
was
so
congruous
with
its
surroundings
that
she
saw
with
surprise
a
face
totally
strange
to
her
the
collar
of
the
rumpled
shirt
was
unbuttoned
at
a
brown
throat
the
face
above
seemed
to
her
eyes
neither
old
nor
young
though
the
light
springing
gait
when
he
walked
the
supple
easeful
attitude
now
that
he
rested
one
hand
flung
high
on
the
curious
tall
staff
were
those
of
a
youth
the
eyes
of
a
warm
laughing
hazel
had
the
direct
fearlessness
of
a
child
and
a
slouch
hat
carried
in
the
hand
showed
a
fair
crop
of
slightly
grizzled
curling
hair
a
stranger
at
first
the
thought
frightened
and
then
attracted
her
this
man
looked
not
unlike
johnnie
own
people
and
there
was
something
in
his
face
that
led
her
to
entertain
the
idea
of
appealing
to
him
for
help
he
settled
the
question
of
whether
or
no
she
should
enter
into
conversation
by
accosting
her
at
once
brusquely
and
genially
mornin
sis
you
look
tired
he
said
you
ought
to
have
a
stick
like
me
hold
on
i
cut
you
one
before
the
girl
could
respond
beyond
an
answering
smile
and
good
morning
the
new
friend
had
put
his
own
alpenstock
into
her
hands
and
gone
to
the
roadside
where
with
unerring
judgment
he
selected
a
long
straight
tapering
shoot
of
ash
and
hewed
it
deftly
with
a
monster
drawn
from
his
trousers
pocket
there
try
that
he
said
as
he
returned
trimming
off
the
last
of
the
leaves
and
branches
johnnie
took
the
staff
with
her
sweet
smile
of
thanks
for
a
few
moments
the
two
walked
on
silently
side
by
side
she
desperately
absorbed
in
her
anxieties
her
companion
apparently
returning
to
some
world
apart
in
his
own
mind
suddenly
can
i
get
to
the
railroad
down
this
side
the
man
asked
her
in
that
odd
incidental
voice
of
his
which
suggested
that
what
he
said
was
merely
a
small
portion
of
what
he
thought
why
yes
i
reckon
so
hesitated
johnnie
it
a
pretty
far
way
and
there
do
many
folks
travel
on
it
it
an
old
indian
trail
a
heap
of
our
roads
here
are
that
but
it
take
you
right
to
the
railroad
the
and
a
her
companion
chuckled
seemingly
with
some
inner
satisfaction
yes
that
just
what
i
supposed
i
soldiered
all
over
this
country
and
i
thought
it
was
about
as
pretty
scenery
as
god
ever
made
i
promised
myself
then
that
if
i
ever
came
back
into
this
part
of
the
world
i
do
some
tramping
through
here
they
going
to
have
a
great
big
banquet
at
atlanta
and
they
had
me
caged
up
taking
me
down
there
to
make
a
speech
i
gave
them
the
slip
at
watauga
i
knew
i
strike
the
railroad
if
i
footed
it
through
the
mountains
here
johnnie
examined
her
companion
with
attention
would
it
do
to
ask
him
if
he
had
seen
an
automobile
on
the
road
a
dark
green
car
dare
she
make
inquiry
as
to
whether
he
had
heard
of
gray
stoddard
disappearance
or
met
any
of
the
searchers
she
decided
on
a
conservative
course
i
wish
i
had
time
to
set
you
in
the
right
road
she
hesitated
but
my
poor
old
uncle
is
out
here
somewhere
among
these
ridges
and
ravines
he
not
in
his
right
mind
and
i
got
to
find
him
if
i
can
crazy
do
you
mean
asked
her
companion
with
a
quick
yet
easy
smiling
attention
i
like
to
see
him
if
he
crazy
i
take
a
great
interest
in
crazy
folks
some
of
have
a
lot
of
sense
left
johnnie
nodded
he
does
know
any
of
us
she
said
pitifully
they
had
him
in
the
hospital
three
months
trying
to
do
something
for
him
but
the
doctors
say
he
never
be
well
that
right
hopeful
observed
the
man
with
a
plainly
intentional
dry
ludicrousness
i
always
think
there
some
chance
when
the
doctors
give
up
and
begin
to
let
alone
how
was
he
hurt
sis
johnnie
did
not
pause
to
reflect
that
she
had
not
said
uncle
pros
was
hurt
at
all
for
some
reason
which
she
would
herself
have
been
at
a
loss
to
explain
she
hastened
to
detail
to
this
stranger
the
exact
appearance
and
nature
of
pros
passmore
injuries
her
listener
nodding
his
head
at
this
or
that
point
making
some
comment
or
inquiry
at
another
the
doctors
say
that
they
would
suppose
it
was
a
fractured
skull
or
concussion
of
the
brain
or
something
like
that
but
they
examined
him
and
there
is
nothing
to
see
on
the
outside
and
they
trephined
and
it
did
do
any
good
so
they
just
let
him
stay
about
the
hospital
no
said
her
new
friend
softly
almost
absently
it
did
do
any
good
to
trephine
but
it
might
have
done
a
lot
of
harm
i
like
to
see
the
back
of
your
uncle
neck
i
ai
in
any
hurry
to
get
to
that
banquet
at
atlanta
a
man
can
always
overeat
and
make
himself
sick
without
going
so
far
to
do
it
so
like
an
idle
schoolboy
the
unknown
forsook
his
own
course
turning
from
the
road
when
johnnie
turned
and
went
with
her
up
the
steep
rocky
gulch
where
the
door
of
a
deserted
cabin
flung
to
and
fro
on
its
hinges
at
sight
of
the
smokeless
chimney
the
gaping
doorway
and
empty
inhospitable
interior
johnnie
looked
blank
have
you
got
anything
to
eat
she
asked
her
companion
hesitatingly
i
came
off
in
such
a
hurry
that
i
forgot
all
about
it
some
people
that
i
know
used
to
live
in
that
cabin
and
i
hoped
to
get
my
dinner
there
and
ask
after
my
uncle
but
i
see
they
have
moved
sit
right
down
here
said
the
stranger
indicating
the
broad
around
which
the
grass
grew
tall
we
soon
make
that
all
right
he
sought
in
the
pockets
of
the
coat
he
carried
slung
across
his
shoulder
and
brought
out
a
packet
of
food
i
laid
in
some
fuel
when
i
thought
i
might
get
the
chance
to
run
my
own
engine
across
the
mountains
he
told
the
girl
opening
his
bundle
and
dividing
evenly
he
uttered
a
few
musical
words
in
an
unknown
tongue
that
indian
he
commented
carelessly
without
looking
at
her
it
means
you
to
eat
your
dinner
i
was
with
the
shawnees
when
i
was
a
boy
i
learned
a
lot
of
their
language
and
i
never
forget
it
they
taught
me
more
things
than
talk
johnnie
studied
the
man
beside
her
as
they
ate
their
bit
of
lunch
my
name
is
johnnie
consadine
sir
she
told
him
what
shall
i
call
you
thus
directly
questioned
the
unknown
smiled
quizzically
his
hazel
eyes
crinkling
at
the
corners
and
overflowing
with
good
humour
well
you
might
say
he
observed
consideringly
lots
of
boys
and
girls
do
call
me
pap
more
than
a
thousand
of
now
i
guess
and
i
eighty
mighty
near
old
enough
to
have
a
girl
of
nineteen
she
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
eighty
years
old
as
lithe
as
a
lad
and
with
a
lad
clear
laughing
eye
yet
there
was
a
look
of
power
of
that
knowledge
which
is
power
in
his
face
that
made
her
say
to
him
do
you
think
that
uncle
pros
can
ever
be
cured
have
his
right
mind
back
again
i
mean
of
course
the
cut
on
his
head
is
healed
up
long
ago
the
cut
on
his
head
did
make
him
crazy
said
her
companion
murmuringly
of
course
it
was
that
or
he
would
have
been
raving
when
he
came
down
from
the
mountain
something
happened
to
him
afterward
yes
there
did
johnnie
assented
wonderingly
falteringly
i
know
how
you
came
to
guess
it
but
the
woman
who
told
me
that
she
was
hiding
in
the
front
room
when
they
were
quarrelling
and
saw
uncle
pros
fall
down
the
steps
says
he
landed
almost
square
on
his
head
she
thought
at
first
his
neck
was
broken
that
he
was
killed
nodded
the
newcomer
you
see
i
a
good
guesser
i
make
my
living
guessing
things
he
flung
her
a
whimsical
sidelong
glance
as
having
finished
their
lunch
they
rose
and
moved
on
i
wish
i
had
my
hands
on
the
processes
of
that
atlas
vertebra
he
said
on
on
what
inquired
johnnie
in
a
slightly
startled
tone
never
mind
sis
if
we
find
him
and
i
can
handle
him
i
know
where
to
look
nobody
can
touch
him
but
me
when
he
gets
out
this
way
johnnie
said
he
acts
sort
of
scared
and
sort
of
fierce
and
just
runs
and
hides
from
people
maybe
if
you
tell
me
what
you
want
done
i
could
do
it
maybe
you
could
and
then
again
maybe
you
could
returned
the
other
with
a
great
show
of
giving
her
proposition
serious
consideration
a
good
many
folks
think
they
can
do
just
what
i
can
if
i
only
tell
how
and
sometimes
they
find
out
they
ca
upon
the
word
they
topped
a
little
rise
and
johnnie
laid
a
swift
detaining
hand
upon
her
companion
arm
at
the
roadside
in
a
little
open
grassy
space
where
once
evidently
a
cabin
had
stood
knelt
the
figure
of
a
gaunt
old
man
at
first
he
seemed
to
the
approaching
pair
to
be
gesticulating
and
pointing
but
a
moment
observation
gave
them
the
gleam
of
a
knife
in
his
hand
he
was
playing
as
they
stood
drawn
back
near
some
roadside
bushes
watching
him
the
long
lean
old
arm
went
up
the
knife
flashing
against
the
knuckles
of
the
clenched
fist
and
with
a
whirl
of
the
wrist
reversing
swiftly
in
air
to
bury
its
blade
in
the
soil
before
the
player
hi
hi
hi
i
it
that
counts
two
for
me
the
cracked
old
falsetto
shrilled
out
there
on
that
grassy
plot
that
might
have
been
a
familiar
dooryard
of
his
early
days
he
was
playing
alone
gone
back
to
childhood
johnnie
gazed
and
her
eyes
swam
with
unshed
tears
you
better
not
go
up
there
and
him
with
the
knife
and
all
she
murmured
finally
the
man
beside
her
looked
around
into
her
face
and
laughed
i
not
very
bad
scared
he
said
advancing
softly
in
line
with
his
proposed
patient
motioning
the
girl
not
to
make
herself
known
or
startle
her
uncle
johnnie
stole
after
him
filled
with
anxiety
when
the
newcomer
stood
directly
behind
the
kneeling
man
he
bent
and
his
arms
shot
out
with
surprising
quickness
the
fingers
of
one
hand
dropped
as
though
predestined
upon
the
back
of
the
neck
the
other
caught
skilfully
beneath
the
chin
there
was
a
sharp
wrench
an
odd
crack
a
grunt
from
uncle
pros
and
then
the
mountaineer
sprang
to
his
full
and
very
considerable
height
with
a
roar
whirling
upon
his
adversary
he
grappled
him
in
his
long
arms
hugging
like
a
grizzly
and
shouting
you
gid
himes
my
specimens
he
shook
the
stranger
savagely
you
an
shade
buckheath
you
o
scoundrels
give
me
back
my
silver
specimens
give
me
back
my
silver
ore
that
shows
about
the
mine
for
my
little
gal
uncle
pros
uncle
pros
screamed
johnnie
rushing
in
and
laying
hold
of
the
man
arm
do
you
know
me
it
johnnie
do
hurt
this
gentleman
the
convulsion
of
rage
subsided
in
the
old
man
with
almost
comical
suddenness
his
tense
form
relaxed
he
stumbled
back
dropping
his
hands
at
his
sides
and
staring
about
him
then
at
johnnie
why
honey
he
gasped
how
did
you
come
here
whar
gid
shade
buckheath
lord
whar
am
i
at
he
looked
around
him
bewildered
evidently
expecting
to
see
the
porch
of
himes
at
cottonville
the
scattered
bits
of
silver
ore
and
the
rifled
bandanna
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
and
sliding
it
softly
down
to
the
back
of
the
neck
demanded
what
been
did
to
me
you
be
right
good
and
quiet
now
and
mind
johnnie
the
girl
began
with
a
pathetic
tremble
in
her
voice
and
she
take
you
back
to
the
hospital
where
they
so
kind
to
you
the
hospital
echoed
pros
that
hospital
down
at
cottonville
i
never
was
inside
o
one
o
them
places
what
do
you
want
me
to
go
thar
for
johnnie
who
is
this
gentleman
how
came
up
here
on
the
road
i
can
quiet
him
said
johnnie
aside
to
her
new
friend
i
always
can
when
he
gets
wild
this
way
the
unknown
shook
his
head
you
never
have
to
quiet
him
any
more
unless
he
breaks
his
neck
again
came
the
announcement
your
uncle
is
as
sane
as
anybody
he
just
does
remember
anything
that
happened
from
the
time
he
fell
down
the
steps
and
slipped
that
atlas
vertebra
a
little
bit
on
one
side
again
pros
passmore
fingers
sought
the
back
of
his
collar
looks
like
somebody
has
been
tryin
to
wring
my
neck
same
as
a
chicken
he
said
meditatively
but
hit
feels
all
right
now
all
right
he
suddenly
broke
off
to
answer
to
a
far
faint
hail
from
the
road
below
them
pap
hey
pap
the
words
came
up
through
the
clear
blue
air
infinitely
diminished
and
attenuated
like
some
insect
cry
the
tall
man
seemed
to
guess
just
what
the
interruption
would
be
he
turned
with
a
pettish
exclamation
never
could
go
anywhere
nor
have
any
fun
but
what
some
of
the
children
had
to
tag
he
protested
he
cupped
his
hands
and
sent
his
voice
toward
where
two
men
in
a
vehicle
had
halted
their
horses
and
were
looking
anxiously
up
well
what
is
it
did
you
get
lost
we
hired
a
buggy
and
came
out
to
find
you
the
man
below
called
up
well
if
i
get
lost
i
can
find
myself
muttered
the
newcomer
he
looked
regretfully
at
the
green
slopes
about
him
the
lofty
impassive
cliffs
where
peace
seemed
to
perch
a
visible
presence
the
great
sweeps
of
free
forest
then
at
uncle
pros
and
johnnie
and
they
looked
back
at
him
dubiously
i
expect
i
have
to
leave
you
he
said
at
last
i
see
what
it
is
those
boys
want
they
trying
to
get
me
back
to
the
railroad
in
time
for
the
train
i
a
heap
rather
stay
here
with
you
but
he
glanced
from
johnnie
and
uncle
pros
down
to
the
men
in
their
attitude
of
anxious
waiting
i
reckon
i
have
to
go
he
had
made
the
first
descending
step
when
johnnie
hand
on
his
arm
arrested
him
uncle
pros
knew
not
the
wonder
of
his
own
restoration
but
to
the
girl
this
man
before
her
was
something
more
than
mortal
her
eyes
went
from
the
lightly
tossed
hair
on
his
brow
to
the
boots
was
he
only
a
human
being
what
was
the
strange
power
he
had
over
life
and
death
and
the
wandering
soul
of
man
what
what
are
you
going
to
tell
me
your
name
and
what
you
are
before
you
go
she
entreated
him
he
laughed
over
his
shoulder
an
enigmatic
laugh
what
was
it
you
did
to
uncle
pros
her
voice
was
vibrant
with
the
awe
and
wonder
of
what
she
had
seen
was
it
the
laying
on
of
hands
as
they
tell
of
it
in
the
bible
say
pap
hurry
up
please
wailed
up
the
thin
impatient
reminder
from
the
road
well
yes
i
laid
my
hands
on
him
pretty
strong
did
i
old
man
and
the
stranger
glanced
to
where
uncle
pros
stood
still
occasionally
interrogating
the
back
of
his
neck
with
fumbling
fingers
do
you
worry
sis
a
girl
like
you
will
get
a
miracle
when
she
has
to
have
it
if
i
happened
to
be
the
miracle
you
needed
why
that
good
as
for
my
profession
my
business
in
life
there
was
a
lot
of
folks
that
used
to
name
me
the
lightning
for
my
own
part
i
just
as
soon
you
call
me
a
human
engineer
i
pride
myself
on
knowing
how
the
structure
of
man
ought
to
work
and
keeping
the
bearings
right
and
the
machinery
properly
levelled
up
never
mind
next
time
you
have
use
for
a
miracle
it
be
along
on
schedule
time
without
you
knowing
what
name
you
need
to
call
it
you
that
sort
with
that
curious
smile
of
his
and
with
a
nod
of
farewell
he
plunged
down
the
steep
chapter
xxiii
a
clue
they
stood
together
watching
as
the
tall
form
retreated
around
the
sharp
curves
of
the
red
clay
road
or
leaped
lightly
and
hardily
down
the
they
waved
back
to
their
late
companion
when
climbing
into
the
waiting
buggy
below
he
was
finally
driven
away
johnnie
turned
and
looked
long
at
her
uncle
with
swimming
eyes
as
he
stood
gazing
where
the
vehicle
had
disappeared
she
finally
laid
a
tremulous
hand
on
his
arm
oh
uncle
pros
she
said
falteringly
i
ca
believe
it
yet
but
you
you
do
understand
me
now
do
you
you
know
me
i
johnnie
the
old
man
wheeled
sharply
and
laughed
see
here
honey
he
said
with
a
tinge
of
irritation
in
his
tones
i
reckon
i
been
crazy
from
what
you
say
looks
like
i
have
known
my
best
friends
for
a
long
time
but
i
have
got
as
much
sense
now
as
i
ever
had
and
i
do
remember
anything
about
that
other
business
last
thing
i
know
of
was
fussin
with
gid
himes
and
shade
buckheath
about
my
silver
by
joe
i
bet
they
got
that
stuff
when
i
was
took
johnnie
was
i
took
sudden
he
seated
himself
on
the
lush
ancient
dooryard
grass
where
a
gone
he
had
knelt
a
harmless
lunatic
playing
mumblety
peg
half
reluctantly
johnnie
sank
down
beside
him
yes
yes
yes
uncle
pros
the
girl
agreed
impatience
mounting
in
her
once
more
with
the
assurance
of
her
uncle
safety
and
they
did
get
your
specimens
but
we
can
fix
all
that
there
a
worse
thing
happened
now
and
swiftly
succinctly
she
told
him
of
the
disappearance
of
gray
stoddard
an
i
been
out
o
my
head
six
months
and
better
the
old
man
ruminated
staring
down
at
the
ground
good
lord
it
funny
to
miss
out
part
o
your
days
like
that
hit
was
august
but
hot
enough
to
fry
eggs
on
a
shingle
the
day
i
tramped
down
to
cottonville
with
them
specimens
and
here
it
is
he
threw
up
his
head
and
took
a
comprehensive
survey
of
the
grove
about
him
airly
spring
march
i
should
say
ai
it
johnnie
yes
as
she
nodded
and
who
is
this
here
young
man
that
you
name
that
missin
honey
the
girl
glanced
at
him
apprehensively
you
know
uncle
pros
she
said
in
a
coaxing
tone
it
stoddard
that
used
to
come
to
the
hospital
to
see
you
so
much
and
play
checkers
with
you
when
you
got
better
you
why
uncle
pros
you
liked
him
more
than
any
one
he
could
get
you
to
eat
when
you
would
take
a
spoonful
from
anybody
else
you
must
remember
him
you
ca
have
forgot
mr
stoddard
pros
thrust
out
a
long
lean
arm
and
fingered
the
sleeve
upon
it
nor
my
own
clothes
i
reckon
he
assented
with
a
sort
of
rueful
testiness
but
to
the
best
of
my
knowin
and
believin
i
never
in
my
life
before
saw
this
shirt
i
wearin
every
garment
i
got
on
is
a
plumb
stranger
to
me
johnnie
ye
say
i
played
checkers
with
him
and
uncle
pros
you
used
to
talk
to
him
by
the
hour
when
you
did
know
me
at
all
johnnie
told
him
chokingly
i
would
get
afraid
that
you
asked
too
much
of
him
but
he
leave
anything
to
come
and
sit
with
you
when
you
were
bad
he
got
the
kindest
heart
of
anybody
i
ever
knew
the
old
man
slow
thoughtful
gaze
was
raised
a
moment
to
her
eloquent
flushed
face
and
then
dropped
considerately
to
the
path
an
ye
tell
me
he
one
of
the
rich
mill
owners
gray
stoddard
that
one
name
you
never
named
in
your
letters
what
cause
have
you
to
think
that
shade
wished
the
man
ill
slowly
johnnie
eyes
filled
with
tears
why
what
shade
said
himself
he
was
jealous
of
him
i
reckon
supplied
the
old
man
johnnie
nodded
it
was
no
time
for
evasions
he
had
no
call
to
be
she
repeated
stoddard
had
no
more
thought
of
me
in
that
way
than
he
has
of
deanie
he
be
just
as
kind
to
one
as
the
other
but
shade
brought
his
name
into
it
and
threatened
him
to
me
in
so
many
words
he
said
she
shivered
at
the
recollection
he
said
he
fix
him
he
get
even
with
him
so
this
morning
when
i
found
that
pap
himes
and
shade
had
taken
stoddard
car
and
come
on
up
this
way
it
scared
me
yet
i
could
hardly
go
to
anybody
with
it
i
felt
as
though
they
would
say
it
was
just
a
vain
foolish
girl
thinking
stirred
up
trouble
and
had
the
men
quarrelling
over
her
i
did
try
to
see
hardwick
and
macpherson
and
both
of
them
were
away
and
after
that
i
went
to
hardwick
house

i
wrote
you
so
much
about

the
only
person
there
and
she
would
do
a
thing
then
i
just
walked
up
here
on
my
two
feet
uncle

i
was
desperate
enough
for

intently

passionate
sentences

said
as
she
made
an
end
i
sorter

to
see

a
minute
he
sat
for
some
time
silent
with
introverted
gaze
johnnie
with
difficulty
restraining
her
impatience
forbearing
to
break
in
upon
his
meditation
hit
up
to
me
sorter
as
i
study
on
it
he
finally
said
like

a
hard
nation
o
folks
johnnie
i

a
spell
and
tried
to
make
see
that
the
hardwick
folks
had
never
sold
no
dead
body
to
the
student
doctors
but
they
was
all
mad
and
out
theirselves
i
seed
that
they
wanted
to
get
up
a
feud
says
rudd
got
one
of
the
dawsons
and
before

done
we
get
one
o
them
i
says
air
to
get
one
o
them
air
ye
do

sam
dawson
buckheath
is
in
with

all
them
mill
fellers
an
their
ways
he
aims
to
us
an
we
ketch
one
o
them
men
out
and
carry
him
off
up
here
and
hold
him
till
they
pay
us
what
we
ask
i
reckon
the
live
body
of
one
o
them
chaps
is
worth
a
thousand
dollars
that
jest
what
he
said
concluded
the
old
man
turning
toward
her
an
from
what
you
tell
me
johnnie
i
bet
shade
buckheath
put
the
words
in
his
mouth
if
not
the
notion
in
his
head
yes
whispered
johnnie
through
white
lips
yes
but
shade
buckheath
is
looking
to
make
money
out
of
it
he
knows
better
than
to
think
that
they
could
keep
stoddard
prisoner
a
while
and
then
get
money
for
bringing
him
back
and
never
have
to
answer
for
it
he
said
he
get
even
he
fix
him
shade
wants
just
one
thing
oh
uncle
pros
do
you
think
they
killed
him
the
old
man
looked
carefully
away
from
her
this
here
kidnappin
business
an
tryin
to
get
money
out
of
a
friends
most
generally
does
wind
up
in
a
killin
he
said
the
folks
gits
to
huntin
pretty
hot
then
them
that
done
the
trick
gets
scared
and
they
would
have
no
good
place
to
put
him
them
dawsons
and
and
reluctantly
a
dead
body
easier
hid
than
a
live
man
truth
is
hit
looks
mighty
bad
for
the
young
feller
honey
girl
to
my
mind
hit
really
a
question
of
time
the
sooner
his
friends
gets
to
him
the
better
that
my
belief
johnnie
pale
haggard
face
took
on
tragic
lines
as
she
listened
to
this
plain
putting
of
her
own
worst
fears
she
sprang
up
desperately
uncle
pros
rose
too
now
which
way
she
demanded
the
old
hunter
stood
staring
thoughtfully
at
the
path
before
his
feet
rubbing
his
jaw
with
long
supple
fingers
the
daze
of
his
recent
experience
yet
upon
him
well
i
had
aimed
to
go
right
to
our
old
cabin
he
said
finally
hit
little
more
than
a
mile
to
where
dawson
lives
in
gid
old
place
in
blue
spring
holler
they
all
think
i
crazy
an
they
interfere
with
me
not
till
they
find
out
different
your
mother
give
us
good
help
once
we
git
to
her
there
them
that
thinks
laurelly
is
and
childish
but
i
could
tell
she
got
a
heap
of
sense
in
that
thar
pretty
little
head
o
oh
uncle
pros
i
forgot
you
do
know
of
course
you
do
broke
in
johnnie
with
a
sudden
dismay
in
her
voice
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
mother
she
hesitated
and
looked
at
the
old
man
mother
is
up
at
the
cabin
any
more
i
left
her
in
cottonville
this
morning
cottonville
echoed
pros
in
surprise
then
he
added
o
course
she
came
down
to
take
care
o
me
when
i
was
hurt
that
like
laurelly
is
all
the
chaps
thar
is
the
cabin
empty
how
the
baby
johnnie
nodded
in
answer
to
these
inquiries
forbearing
to
go
into
any
details
one
thing
she
must
tell
him
mother
mother
married
again
she
managed
finally
to
say
she
the
old
man
broke
off
and
turned
johnnie
around
that
he
might
stare
into
her
face
then
he
laughed
well
well
things
have
been
happenin
with
the
old
man
crazy
an
all
he
said
an
yit
i
know
it
so
strange
laurelly
is
a
mighty
handsome
little
woman
and
she
do
look
a
day
older
than
you
do
johnnie
i
reckon
it
came
through
me
bein
away
an
her
havin
nobody
to
do
for
her
with
pride
she
could
have
wedded
any
time
since
your
pa
died
if
she
been
so
minded
who
is
it
johnnie
looked
away
from
him
i
uncle
pros
i
never
heard
a
word
about
it
till
i
came
home
one
evening
and
there
they
were
bag
and
baggage
and
they
been
married
but
an
hour
before
by
squire
gaylord
it
her
voice
sank
almost
to
a
whisper
it
pap
himes
the
old
man
thrust
her
back
and
stared
again
gid
gideon
himes
he
exclaimed
incredulously
why

man

enough
to
be
her
let
alone
her
father
gid
himes
the
old
what
in
the
name
of
johnnie
and
you
think
himes
is
mixed
up
with
this
young
man
that
been
laywaid
him
and
buckheath
lord
what
all
this
business
when
shade
found
i
would
have
him
johnnie
began
resolutely
at
the
beginning
he
got
pap
himes
to
take
him
to
board
so
that
he
could
always
be
at
me
tormenting
me
about
it
i
do
know
what
he
and
pap
himes
had
between
them
but
something
that
i
sure
of
and
after
the
old
man
went
up
and
married
mother
it
was
worse
he
put
the
children
in
the
mill
and
worked
them
almost
to
death
even
even
deanie
she
choked
back
a
sob
and
shade
as
good
as
told
me
he
could
make
pap
himes
stop
it
any
time
i
promise
to
marry
him
something
they
were
pulling
together
over
maybe
it
was
the
silver
mine
the
silver
mine
echoed
old
pros
that
it
gid
thought
i
was
likely
to
die
and
the
mine
would
come
to
your
mother
not
but
what
he
be
glad
enough
to
get
laurelly
but
that
what
put
it
in
his
head
an
gid
himes
is
married
to
my
little
laurelly
an
been
abusin

for
a
man
to
go
crazy
things

out
of
order
without

now
johnnie
inquired
impatiently
we
stay
here
talking
when
stoddard
may
be
in
mortal
danger
shall
we
go
on
to
our
place
just
the
same
the
old
man
looked
compassionately
at
her
hold
on
honey
girl
he
demurred
gently
we
he
sighted
at
the
sun
which
was
declining
over
beyond
the
ridges
toward
watauga
i
mighty
sorry
to
pull
back
on
ye
but
we
got
to
get
us
a
place
to
stay
for
the
night
see
he
directed
her
gaze
with
his
own
hit
not
more
a
hour
by
sun
we
cai
do
nothin
this
evenin
the
magnitude
of
the
disappointment
struck
johnnie
silent
pros
passmore
was
an
optimist
one
who
never
used
a
strong
word
to
express
sorrow
or
dismay
but
he
came
out
of
a
brown
study
in
which
he
had
muttered
blaylock
no
harp
would
do
culp
sally
ann
not
to
be
trusted
what
about
the
venable
boys
no
good
to
say
with
a
distressed
drawing
of
the
brows
my
god
in
a
thing
like
this
you
do
know
who
to
look
to
no
that
so
uncle
pros
whispered
johnnie
she
gazed
back
down
the
road
she
had
come
with
the
stranger
i
went
up
slater
lane
to
find
mandy
meacham
sister
roxy
that
married
zack
peavey
she
said
but
they
moved
from
the
cabin
down
there
they
must
have
been
gone
a
good
while
for
there
no
work
done
on
the
i
guess
they
went
up
to
the
place
mandy
said
they
talked
of
moving
there
we
might
go
and
see
mandy
she
hesitated
and
looked
questioningly
at
her
uncle
mandy
been
awful
good
to
all
of
us
and
she
liked
mr
stoddard
we
try
it
said
pros
passmore
and
they
set
out
together
they
climbed
in
silence
using
a
scarce
more
than
two
deep
ruts
full
of
rotting
stumps
suddenly
a
couple
of
children
playing
under
some
wayside
bushes
leaped
up
and
ran
ahead
of
them
screaming
maw
he
comin
back
and
he
got
a
woman
with
him
a
turn
in
the
road
brought
the
cabin
in
sight
a
tiny
log
structure
ancient
and
ruinous
and
in
its
door
a
young
woman
standing
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
staring
with
all
her
eyes
at
them
and
at
their
approaching
couriers
she
faltered
a
step
toward
the
dilapidated
rail
fence
as
they
came
up
howdy
she
said
in
a
low
tone
then
to
uncle
pros
was
mighty
uneasy
when
you
never
come
back
involuntarily
the
old
man
hand
went
to
that
vertebra
whose
displacement
had
been
so
lately
reduced
have
i
been
here
he
asked
i
was
out
of
my
head
and
i
remember
it
the
young
woman
looked
at
him
with
a
hopeless
drawing
of
scant
light
eyebrows
above
bulging
gray
eyes
she
chugged
the
fretting
baby
gently
up
and
down
in
her
arms
to
hush
it
johnnie
saw
her
resemblance
to
mandy
apparently
giving
up
the
effort
in
regard
to
the
man
zack
peavey
wife
addressed
the
girl
as
an
easier
proposition
he
was
here
she
said
in
a
sort
of
aside
he
stayed
all
night
zack
said
he
was
kinder
foolish
but
i
thought
he
had
as
much
sense
as
most
of
her
gaze
rested
kindly
on
the
old
man
the
children
wild
and
shy
as
young
foxes
had
stolen
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
in
which
they
had
taken
refuge
and
were
staring
out
wonderingly
well
we
have
to
ask
you
could
we
stay
johnnie
began
doubtfully
my
uncle
been
out
of
his
head
and
he
got
away
from
the
folks
at
the
hospital
i
came
up
to
hunt
for
him
i
just
found
him
but
we
are
going
right
back
i
met
a
man
out
there
on
the
road
that
did
something
to
him
that
that
she
despaired
of
putting
into
words
that
the
woman
could
comprehend
the
miracle
which
she
had
seen
the
stranger
work
well
uncle
pros
is
all
right
now
and
we
like
to
stay
the
night
if
we
can
come
in
come
in
the
both
of
you
urged
the
woman
turning
toward
the
cabin
ye
kin
stay
an
welcome
set
and
rest
zack
ai
home
now
he
a
curious
furtive
look
went
over
her
round
face
zack
has
got
a
job
on
hand
ploughing
for
ploughing
for
a
neighbour
but
be
home
they
went
in
and
sat
down
a
kettle
of
wild
greens
was
cooking
over
the
fire
and
everything
was
spotlessly
clean
mandy
had
said
truly
that
there
was
a
thing
on
the
farm
she
did
love
to
do
and
the
gift
of
housewifery
ran
in
the
family
johnnie
had
barely
explained
who
she
was
and
made
such
effort
as
she
could
to
enlist
mandy
sister
when
zack
came
tramping
home
and
showed
she
thought
some
uneasiness
at
finding
them
there
the
wife
ran
out
and
met
him
before
he
reached
the
cabin
and
they
stood
talking
together
a
long
time
the
lines
of
both
figures
somehow
expressing
dismay
yet
when
they
came
in
there
was
a
fair
welcome
in
the
man
demeanour
at
the
supper
table
whose
scanty
fare
was
well
cooked
uncle
pros
and
johnnie
had
to
tell
again
and
yet
again
the
story
of
that
miraculous
healing
which
both
husband
and
wife
could
see
was
genuine
through
it
all
both
pros
and
johnnie
attempted
to
lead
the
talk
around
to
some
information
which
might
be
of
use
to
them
nothing
was
more
natural
than
that
they
should
speak
of
gray
stoddard
disappearance
since
watauga
cottonville
and
the
mountains
above
were
full
of
the
topic
yet
husband
and
wife
sheered
from
it
in
a
sort
of
terror
them
that
makes
or
meddles
in
such
gits
theirselves
into
trouble
that
what
i
say
zack
told
the
visitors
stroking
a
chin
whose
contours
expressed
the
resolution
and
aggressiveness
of
a
rabbit
i
ai
never
seen
this
here
man
as
far
as
i
know
i
do
never
want
to
see
him
i
ai
got
no
call
to
mix
myself
up
in
such
and
i
i
sleep
easier
and
live
longer
if
i
do
do
it
that
right
quavered
roxy
burkhalter
boy
he
had
to
go
to
in
when
the
culps
and
the
venables
was
feudin
and
look
what
chanced
nary
one
o
them
families
lost
a
man
but
burkhalter
boy
got
hisself
killed
up
yes
that
what
happened
to
him
dead
i
went
to
the
funeral
true
as
scriptur
confirmed
zack
reach
an
take
off
pros
johnnie
eat
hearty
true
as
set
here
i
make
the
coffin
an
dig
the
grave
after
a
time
there
came
a
sort
of
ruth
to
johnnie
for
the
poor
creatures
furtive
stealing
glances
at
each
other
and
answering
her
inquiries
or
uncle
pros
with
dry
evasive
platitudes
she
knew
there
was
no
malice
in
either
of
them
and
that
only
the
abject
terror
of
the
weak
kept
them
from
giving
whatever
bit
of
information
it
was
they
had
and
were
consciously
withholding
soon
she
ceased
plying
them
with
questions
and
signalled
uncle
pros
that
he
should
do
the
same
after
the
children
were
asleep
in
their
the
four
elders
sat
by
the
dying
fire
on
the
hearth
and
talked
a
little
johnnie
told
zack
and
roxy
of
the
mill
work
at
cottonville
how
well
she
had
got
on
and
how
good
stoddard
had
been
to
her
choking
over
the
treasured
remembrances
she
related
the
many
kindnesses
that
had
been
shown
pros
and
his
kinfolk
at
the
hospital
how
the
old
man
had
been
there
for
three
months
treated
as
a
guest
during
the
latter
part
of
his
stay
rather
than
a
patient
and
how
stoddard
would
leave
his
work
in
the
office
to
come
and
cheer
the
sick
man
or
quiet
him
if
he
got
violent
he
looked
perfectly
dreadful
when
i
first
saw
him
she
said
to
them
but
the
doctors
took
care
of
him
as
if
he
been
a
little
baby
the
nurses
fed
him
by
spoonfuls
and
coaxed
him
just
like
you
would
little
honey
and
stoddard
he
never
was
too
busy
to
the
tears
brimmed
her
eyes
in
the
dusky
cabin
interior
to
come
when
uncle
pros
begged
for
him
the
woman
sighed
and
stirred
uneasily
her
eye
stealthily
seeking
her
husband
in
that
little
hut
there
was
no
place
for
guests
presently
the
men
drifted
out
to
the
chip
pile
where
they
lingered
a
while
in
desultory
talk
roxy
and
johnnie
partly
undressed
occupied
the
one
bed
and
later
the
host
and
his
guest
came
in
and
lay
down
clothed
just
as
they
were
with
their
feet
to
the
fire
and
slept
in
the
darkness
just
before
dawn
johnnie
wakened
from
heavy
sleep
and
raised
her
head
to
find
that
a
clear
fire
was
burning
on
the
hearth
and
the
two
men
were
gone
noiselessly
she
arose
and
replaced
her
outer
wear
thinking
to
slip
away
without
disturbing
roxy
but
when
she
returned
softly
to
the
interior
after
laving
face
and
hands
out
at
the
and
ordering
her
abundant
hair
she
found
the
little
woman
up
and
clad
slicing
bacon
and
making
coffee
of
generous
strength
from
their
scanty
store
no
why
the
idea
cried
roxy
of
course
you
was
on
from
no
house
o
mine
no
breakfast
why
i
say
johnnie
throat
swelled
at
the
humble
kindness
they
ate
thanked
roxy
and
her
man
zack
in
the
simple
uneffusive
mountain
fashion
and
started
away
in
the
twilight
of
dawn
the
big
road
was
barely
reached
when
they
heard
steps
coming
after
them
in
the
dusk
and
a
breathless
voice
calling
in
a
whisper
johnnie
johnnie
the
two
turned
and
waited
till
roxy
came
up
i
ye
dropped
this
on
the
floor
the
woman
said
fumbling
in
her
pocket
and
bringing
out
a
bit
of
paper
i
did
know
as
it
was
of
any
value
and
then
again
i
did
know
but
what
it
might
be
johnnie
she
broke
off
and
stood
peering
hesitatingly
into
the
gloom
toward
the
girl
shining
face
with
a
quick
touch
of
the
arm
johnnie
signed
to
pros
to
move
on
as
he
swung
out
of
earshot
the
bulging
light
eyes
so
like
mandy
were
suddenly
dimmed
by
a
rush
of
tears
i
reckon
he
beat
me
ef
he
knowed
i
told
roxy
gasped
he
never
struck
me
yit
and
us
married
five
year
but
i
reckon
he
beat
me
for
that
johnnie
wisely
forbore
reply
or
interference
of
any
sort
the
woman
gulped
drew
her
breath
hard
and
looked
about
her
johnnie
she
whispered
again
the
that
there
thing
they
ride
in
the
hit
broke
down
and
zack
was
over
to
pres
blacksmith
shop
work
on
it
all
day
yesterday
you
know
pres
he
married
lura
dawson
aunt
neither
himes
nor
buckheath
could
git
it
to
move
but
by
night
they
had
it
or
so
hit
run
that
why
you
never
saw
tracks
of
it
on
the
road
hit
had
been
along
thar

but
hit
went
on
this
morning

my
god
i
wish
the
would
quit
their
fussin
an
feudin
and
she
turned
and
ran
distractedly
back
into
the
cabin
while
johnnie
hurried
on
to
join
her
uncle
chapter
xxiv
the
rescue
johnnie
caught
her
uncle
hand
and
ran
with
him
through
the
little
thicket
of
saplings
toward
the
main
road
we
get
the
track
of
the
wheels
and
when
we
find
that
car
and
shade
buckheath
and
pap
himes
johnnie
panted
and
did
not
finish
her
sentence
her
heart
leaped
when
they
came
upon
the
broad
mark
of
the
pneumatic
tires
still
fresh
in
the
lonely
mountain
road
looks
like
they
might
have
passed
here
while
we
was
standin
back
there
talkin
to
roxy
uncle
pros
said
they
could
have
we
not
have
heard
a
thing
that
distance
through
this
thick
woods
wonder
could
we
catch
up
with
them
johnnie
shook
her
head
she
remembered
the
car
flying
up
the
ascents
swooping
down
long
slopes
and
skimming
like
a
bird
across
the
levels
that
morning
when
she
had
driven
it
they
go
almost
as
fast
as
a
railroad
train
uncle
pros
she
told
him
but
we
must
get
there
as
soon
as
we
can
after
that
scarcely
a
word
was
spoken
while
the
two
still
hand
in
hand
made
what
speed
they
could
the
morning
waxed
the
march
sunshine
was
warm
and
pleasant
it
was
even
hot
toiling
endlessly
up
that
mountain
road
now
and
again
they
met
people
who
knew
and
saluted
them
and
who
looked
back
at
them
curiously
furtively
at
least
it
seemed
so
to
the
old
man
and
the
girl
once
a
lean
fellow
ploughing
a
hillside
field
shouted
across
it
pros
passmore
how
yuh
come
on
i
the
student
doctors
would
had
you
long
ago
pros
ventured
no
reply
save
a
wagging
of
the
head
that
blaylock
cousin
he
muttered
to
johnnie
mighty
glad
we
never
went
near
last
night
once
or
twice
they
were
delayed
to
talk
johnnie
would
have
hurried
on
but
her
uncle
warned
her
with
a
look
to
do
nothing
unusual
everybody
spoke
to
them
of
gray
stoddard
nobody
had
seen
anything
of
him
within
a
month
of
his
disappearance
but
several
of
them
had
hearn
say
they
tell
me
vouchsafed
a
lanky
boy
dawdling
with
his
axe
at
a
chip
pile
that
the
word
goes
in
cottonville
now
that
he
took
money
and
lit
out
for
canada
town
folks
is
always
such
like
as
not
bud
pros
assented
gravely
me
and
johnnie
is
goin
up
to
look
after
the
old
house
but
we
allowed
to
sleep
at
bushares
time
enough
to
git
to
our
place
johnnie
who
knew
that
her
uncle
hoped
to
reach
the
consadine
cabin
by
noon
instantly
understood
that
he
considered
the
possibility
of
this
boy
being
a
sort
of
picket
posted
to
interview
and
that
the
intention
was
to
misinform
him
so
that
he
should
not
carry
news
of
their
approach
after
this
they
met
no
one
but
swung
on
at
their
best
pace
and
for
the
most
part
in
silence
husbanding
strength
and
breath
twelve
saw
them
entering
that
gash
of
the
hills
where
the
little
cabin
crouched
against
the
great
mountain
wall
the
ground
became
so
rocky
that
the
track
of
the
automobile
was
lost
at
first
it
would
be
visible
now
and
again
on
a
bit
of
sandy
loam
chain
marks
showing
where
the
tire
left
no
impression
but
within
a
mile
or
so
of
the
consadine
home
it
seemed
to
have
left
the
trail
when
this
point
arrived
johnnie
differed
from
her
uncle
in
choosing
to
hold
to
the
road
honey
this
ends
the
looks
like
they
turned
out
i
think
they
took
off
into
the
bushes
here
and
where
that
cyar
goes
we
ought
to
go
pros
argued
but
johnnie
hurried
on
ahead
looking
about
her
eagerly
suddenly
she
stooped
with
a
cry
and
picked
up
from
the
path
a
small
object
they
carried
him
past
this
way
she
panted
oh
uncle
pros
he
was
right
here
not
so
very
long
ago
she
scrutinized
the
sparse
growth
the
leafless
bushes
about
the
spot
looking
for
signs
of
a
struggle
and
the
question
in
her
heart
was
my
god
was
he
alive
or
dead
the
thing
she
held
in
her
hand
was
a
blossom
of
the
pink
moccasin
flower
carefully
pressed
as
though
for
the
pages
of
a
herbarium
the
bit
of
paper
to
which
it
was
attached
was
crumpled
and
discoloured
looks
like
it
had
laid
out
in
the
dew
last
night
breathed
johnnie
or
for
a
week
supplied
pros
he
scanned
the
little
brown
thing
then
her
face
all
right
he
said
dubiously
if
that
there
tells
you
that
he
come
here
we
foller
this
road
though
it
to
me
like
we
ought
to
stick
to
the
cyar
it
is
far
to
our
house
urged
johnnie
let
go
there
first
anyhow
for
a
few
minutes
they
pressed
ahead
in
silence
then
some
subtle
excitement
made
them
break
into
a
run
thus
they
rounded
the
turn
the
cabin
came
in
sight
its
door
swung
wide
on
complaining
hinges
the
last
of
the
rickety
fence
had
fallen
the
desolation
and
decay
of
a
deserted
house
was
over
all
there
been
folks
here
lately
panted
pros
look
thar
and
he
pointed
to
a
huddle
of
baskets
and
garments
on
the
porch
mind
out
go
careful
they
may
be
thar
now
they
went
careful
stealing
up
the
steps
and
entering
with
caution
but
they
found
nothing
more
alarming
than
the
four
bare
walls
the
fireless
hearth
the
musty
smell
of
a
house
near
the
back
door
at
a
spot
where
the
dust
was
thick
uncle
pros
bent
to
examine
a
when
an
exclamation
from
johnnie
called
him
through
to
the
rear
of
the
cabin
see
the
door
she
cried
running
up
the
steep
way
toward
the
cave
hold
on
honey
go
easy
cautioned
her
uncle
following
as
fast
as
he
could
he
noted
the
whittling
where
the
sapling
bar
that
held
the
stout
oaken
door
in
place
had
been
recently
shaped
to
its
present
purpose
then
a
soft
rhythmic
sound
like
a
giant
breathing
in
his
sleep
caught
the
old
hunter
keen
ear
watch
out
johnnie
he
called
catching
her
arm
what
that
listen
her
fingers
were
almost
on
the
bar
they
could
hear
the
soft
of
the
water
as
it
welled
out
beneath
the
threshold
mingled
with
the
tinkle
and
fall
of
the
spring
branch
below
johnnie
turned
in
her
uncle
grasp
and
clutched
him
staring
down
something
shining
and
dark
brave
with
brass
and
flashing
lamps
stood
on
the
rocky
way
beneath
and
purred
like
a
great
cat
in
the
broad
sunlight
of
noon
gray
stoddard
motor
car
the
two
clinging
to
each
other
on
the
steep
above
it
gazed
half
incredulous
now
that
they
had
found
the
thing
they
sought
it
looked
so
unbelievably
adequate
and
modern
and
alive
standing
there
drawing
its
perfectly
measured
breath
it
was
so
eloquent
of
power
and
the
work
of
men
hands
that
there
seemed
to
yawn
a
gap
of
half
a
thousand
years
between
it
and
the
raid
in
which
it
was
being
made
a
factor
that
this
pet
toy
of
the
modern
millionaire
should
be
set
to
work
out
the
crude
vengeance
of
wild
men
in
these
primitive
surroundings
crowded
up
on
a
little
rocky
path
of
these
savage
mountains
at
the
door
of
a
cave
such
a
as
a
nomad
indian
might
have
utilized
in
the
gray
bluff
against
the
it
took
the
breath
with
its
sinister
strangeness
they
turned
to
the
barred
door
the
cave
was
a
sizable
opening
running
far
back
into
the
mountain
indeed
the
end
of
it
had
never
been
explored
but
the
vestibule
containing
the
spring
was
fitted
with
rude
benches
and
shelves
for
holding
pans
of
milk
and
jars
of
buttermilk
as
johnnie
hand
went
out
to
the
newly
cut
bar
her
uncle
once
more
laid
a
restraining
grasp
upon
it
a
dozen
men
might
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
oaken
door
and
there
might
be
nobody
hello
he
called
guardedly
no
answer
came
but
within
there
was
a
sound
of
clinking
and
then
a
shuffling
movement
the
panting
motor
spoke
loud
of
those
who
had
brought
it
there
who
must
be
expecting
to
return
to
it
very
shortly
johnnie
nerves
gave
way
hello
is
there
anybody
inside
she
demanded
fearfully
who
there
who
is
it
came
a
muffled
hail
from
the
cave
in
a
voice
that
sent
the
blood
to
johnnie
heart
with
a
sudden
shock
uncle
pros
we
found
him
she
screamed
pushing
the
old
man
aside
and
tugging
at
the
bar
which
held
the
door
in
place
as
she
worked
there
came
a
curious
clinking
sound
and
then
the
dull
impact
of
a
heavy
fall
and
when
she
dragged
the
bar
loose
swung
the
door
wide
and
peered
into
the
gloom
there
was
nothing
but
the
silvery
reach
of
the
great
spring
and
beyond
it
a
prone
figure
in
russet
uncle
pros
he
hurt
oh
help
me
she
cried
the
prostrate
man
struggled
to
turn
his
face
to
them
is
that
you
johnnie
gray
stoddard
voice
asked
no
i
not
hurt
these
things
tripped
me
up
the
two
got
to
him
simultaneously
they
found
him
in
heavy
shackles
they
noted
how
ankle
and
wrist
chains
had
been
rivetted
in
place
together
they
helped
him
up
as
they
did
so
tears
ran
down
johnnie
cheeks
unregarded
passmore
deeply
moved
yet
quiet
studied
him
covertly
this
then
was
the
man
of
whom
johnnie
thought
so
much
the
rich
young
fellow
who
had
left
his
work
or
amusements
to
come
and
cheer
a
sick
old
man
in
the
hospital
this
was
the
face
that
was
a
stranger
to
him
but
which
had
leaned
over
his
cot
or
sat
across
the
from
him
for
long
hours
while
they
talked
or
played
together
that
face
was
pale
now
the
brown
hair
a
little
longer
than
other
people
wore
it
tossed
helplessly
in
stoddard
eyes
because
he
scarcely
could
raise
his
shackled
hands
to
put
it
right
his
clothing
was
torn
and
grimed
as
though
with
more
than
one
struggle
though
it
may
have
been
nothing
worse
than
such
mishap
as
his
recent
fall
yet
the
man
soul
looked
out
of
his
eyes
with
the
same
composure
the
same
kindness
that
always
were
his
he
was
eaten
by
neither
terror
nor
rage
though
he
was
alert
for
every
possibility
of
help
or
of
advantage
you
johnnie
you
whispered
gray
struggling
to
his
knees
with
their
assistance
and
catching
a
fold
of
her
dress
in
those
manacled
hands
i
have
dreamed
about
you
here
in
the
dark
it
is
you
it
is
really
johnnie
he
was
pale
dishevelled
with
a
long
mark
of
black
across
his
cheek
from
his
recent
fall
and
johnnie
bent
speechlessly
to
wipe
the
stain
away
and
put
back
the
troublesome
lock
he
looked
up
into
the
brave
beauty
of
her
young
face
thank
god
for
you
johnnie
he
murmured
i
might
have
known
i
would
be
let
to
die
here
in
the
dark
like
a
rat
in
a
hole
while
johnnie
lived
whar
them
that
brought
you
here
the
keepers
questioned
the
old
man
anxiously
in
a
hoarse
hurried
whisper
dawson
gone
to
his
dinner
returned
gray
there
were
others
here
came
in
an
auto
i
heard
that
they
been
quarrelling
for
more
than
an
hour
about
what
they
do
with
you
broke
in
pros
yes
part
of
wants
to
put
you
out
of
the
way
of
course
he
stooped
eagerly
examining
the
shackles
on
gray
ankles
no
way
to
git
them
things
off
without
time
and
a
file
he
muttered
shaking
his
head
no
agreed
stoddard
and
i
ca
run
much
with
them
on
but
we
must
get
away
from
here
as
quick
as
we
can
dawson
came
in
and
told
me
after
the
other
had
gone
that
they
had
a
big
row
and
he
was
standing
out
for
me
said
he
never
give
in
to
have
me
taken
down
and
tied
on
the
railroad
track
in
stryver
gulch
johnnie
fair
face
whitened
at
the
sinister
words
the
car
she
cried
it
your
own
stoddard
and
it
right
down
here
uncle
pros
we
can
get
him
to
it
i
can
run
it
i
know
how
she
put
her
shoulder
under
stoddard
catching
the
manacled
hand
in
hers
pros
laid
hold
on
the
other
side
and
between
them
they
half
carried
the
shackled
captive
around
the
spring
and
to
the
door
leggo
johnnie
cried
her
uncle
you
run
on
down
and
see
if
that
contraption
will
go
i
can
git
him
thar
now
johnnie
instantly
loosed
the
arm
she
held
sprang
through
the
doorway
and
headlong
down
the
bluffy
steep
stones
rattling
about
her
she
leaped
into
the
car
would
her
memory
serve
her
would
she
forget
some
detail
that
she
must
know
there
were
two
levers
under
the
she
advanced
her
spark
and
partly
opened
the
throttle
from
the
steady
comfortable
purr
which
had
undertoned
all
sounds
in
the
tiny
glen
the
machine
burst
at
once
into
a
roar
the
narrow
depression
vibrated
with
its
joyous
clamour
suddenly
above
the
sound
johnnie
was
aware
of
a
distant
hail
which
finally
resolved
itself
into
words
hi
hoo
ee
you
let
that
car
alone
whoever
you
are
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
passmore
had
got
gray
to
the
top
of
the
declivity
and
was
attempting
to
help
him
down
both
men
evidently
heard
the
challenge
but
she
screamed
to
them
again
and
again
hurry
oh
hurry
they
coming
they
coming
stoddard
had
been
stepping
as
best
he
could
hobbling
along
in
the
hampering
leg
chains
that
were
attached
to
the
wrists
also
and
twitched
on
his
hands
with
every
step
his
muscles
responded
to
johnnie
cry
almost
automatically
stiffening
to
an
effort
at
extra
speed
and
he
fell
headlong
dragging
pros
down
with
him
despairingly
johnnie
started
to
climb
down
from
the
car
and
go
to
their
aid
but
her
uncle
leaped
to
his
feet
clawing
and
grabbing
to
find
a
hold
around
gray
waist
panting
out
stay
thar
johnnie
i
can
fetch
him
with
a
straining
heave
he
hoisted
gray
helpless
body
into
his
arms
the
car
trembled
like
a
great
eager
monster
growling
in
leash
johnnie
agonized
eyes
searched
first
its
mechanism
and
then
went
to
the
descending
figures
where
her
uncle
plunged
desperately
down
the
slope
fell
struggled
rolled
but
rose
and
came
gallantly
on
half
dragging
half
carrying
gray
in
his
arms
let
that
car
alone
a
new
voice
took
up
the
hail
a
little
nearer
this
time
and
after
it
came
the
sound
of
a
shot
high
up
on
the
brow
against
the
sky
johnnie
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
men
with
the
slanting
bar
of
a
gun
barrel
over
one
oh
hurry
uncle
pros
she
sobbed
let
me
come
back
and
help
you
but
passmore
stumbled
across
the
remaining
space
mutely
with
drawn
face
and
loud
labouring
breath
he
lifted
gray
and
thrust
him
any
fashion
into
the
tonneau
climbing
blindly
after
the
pursuit
on
the
hill
above
broke
into
the
open
johnnie
moved
the
levers
as
gray
had
shown
her
how
to
do
and
with
a
bound
of
the
great
machine
they
were
off
stoddard
dazed
bruised
abraded
was
back
in
the
tonneau
struggling
up
with
uncle
pros
assistance
he
could
not
help
her
she
must
know
for
herself
and
do
the
right
thing
the
track
led
through
the
bushes
as
they
had
found
it
that
morning
it
was
fairly
good
but
terribly
steep
she
noted
that
the
speed
lever
was
at
neutral
she
slipped
it
over
to
the
first
speed
the
car
was
already
leaping
down
the
hill
at
a
tremendous
pace
yet
those
yelling
voices
were
behind
and
her
pushing
fingers
carried
the
lever
through
second
to
the
third
speed
without
pausing
under
this
tremendous
pressure
the
car
jumped
like
a
nervous
horse
lurched
drunkenly
down
the
short
way
but
reeled
successfully
around
the
turn
at
the
bottom
johnnie
knew
this
was
going
too
fast
she
debated
the
possibility
of
slackening
the
speed
a
bit
as
they
struck
the
highway
such
as
it
was
uncle
pros
yet
gasping
was
trying
to
help
gray
into
the
seat
but
with
his
hampering
manacles
and
the
jerking
of
the
car
the
younger
man
was
still
on
his
knees
when
the
chase
burst
through
the
bushes
scarcely
more
than
three
hundred
feet
behind
them
there
was
a
hoarse
baying
of
men
voices
there
were
four
of
them
running
hard
and
two
carried
guns
the
noise
of
the
machine
of
course
prevented
its
occupants
from
distinguishing
any
word
but
the
menace
of
the
open
pursuit
was
apparent
johnnie
cried
gray
oh
this
wo
do
for
god
sake
passmore
help
me
over
there
they
would
want
to
hurt
her
but
they
going
to
shoot
she
the
old
man
thrust
gray
down
with
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
keep
out
o
range
he
shouted
close
to
gray
ear
they
wo
aim
to
hit
johnnie
but
you
they
pick
off
as
far
as
they
can
see
ye
bend
low
honey
to
the
girl
in
the
driver
seat
but
freeze
to
it
johnnie
ai
no
niece
of
mine
if
she
goes
back
on
a
friend
the
girl
in
front
heard
neither
of
them
there
was
a
bellowing
detonation
and
a
spatter
of
shot
fell
about
the
flying
car
that
ai
goin
to
hurt
nobody
commented
pros
philosophically
no
more
than
anyhow
illustration
the
car
was
already
leaping
down
the
hill
at
a
tremendous
pace
but
on
the
word
followed
a
more
ominous
crack
and
there
was
the
whine
of
a
bullet
above
them
my
god
i
ca
let
her
do
this
gray
protested
but
johnnie
turned
over
her
shoulder
a
shining
face
from
which
all
weariness
had
suddenly
been
erased
a
glorified
countenance
that
flung
him
the
fleeting
smile
she
had
time
to
spare
from
the
machine
you
in
worse
danger
right
now
from
my
driving
than
you
are
from
their
guns
she
panted
as
she
spoke
there
sounded
once
more
the
ripping
crack
of
a
rifle
the
singing
of
a
bullet
past
them
and
with
it
the
flatter
louder
noise
of
the
was
repeated
her
eye
in
the
act
of
turning
to
her
task
caught
the
silhouette
of
old
gideon
himes
uncouth
figure
relieved
against
the
noonday
sky
as
he
sprang
high
both
arms
flung
up
the
hands
empty
and
clutching
and
pitched
headlong
to
his
face
but
her
mind
scarcely
registered
the
impression
for
a
rifle
ball
struck
the
shaly
edge
of
a
bluff
under
which
the
road
at
this
point
ran
and
tore
loose
a
piece
of
the
rock
which
glanced
whirling
into
the
tonneau
and
grazed
gray
stoddard
temple
he
fell
forward
crumpling
down
into
the
bottom
of
the
vehicle
on
go
on
honey
yelled
pros
motioning
vehemently
to
the
girl
do
look
back
here
i
tend
to
him
and
he
stooped
over
the
motionless
form
then
came
the
roaring
impression
of
speed
of
rushing
bushes
that
gathered
themselves
and
ran
back
past
the
car
while
working
under
full
power
it
stood
stationary
as
it
seemed
to
johnnie
in
the
middle
of
a
long
dusty
gray
ribbon
that
was
the
road
the
cries
of
the
men
behind
them
all
sounds
of
pursuit
were
soon
left
so
far
in
the
distance
that
they
were
unheard
ai
this
rather
fast
shouted
uncle
pros
who
had
lifted
bleeding
head
to
his
knee
and
crouched
on
the
bottom
of
the
tonneau
was
shielding
the
younger
man
from
further
injury
as
the
motor
lurched
and
pitched
yes
it
too
fast
johnnie
screamed
back
to
him
i
trying
to
go
slower
but
the
wo
hold
uncle
pros
is
he
hurt
is
he
hurt
bad
i
do
think
so
honey
roared
the
old
man
stoutly
guarding
inert
body
with
his
arm
then
stretching
up
as
he
kneeled
and
leaning
forward
as
close
to
her
ear
as
he
could
get
but
you
git
him
to
cottonville
quick
as
you
can
do
you
werry
about
goin
slow
unlessen
you
scared
yourself
thar
ai
no
tellin
who
might
pop
up
from
behind
these
here
bushes
and
take
a
chance
shot
at
us
as
we
go
by
johnnie
worked
over
her
machine
wildly
gray
had
told
her
of
the
only
but
her
hand
encountering
the
lever
of
the
emergency
brake
she
grasped
it
at
a
hazard
and
shoved
it
forward
as
the
god
of
luck
had
ordered
just
short
of
a
zigzag
in
the
steep
mountain
road
which
at
the
speed
they
had
been
making
would
have
piled
them
a
mass
of
wreckage
beneath
the
cliff
the
sudden
violent
check
shooting
along
at
the
speed
they
were
it
amounted
almost
to
a
stoppage
gave
the
girl
a
sense
of
power
if
she
could
do
that
they
were
fairly
safe
with
the
relief
her
brain
cleared
she
was
able
to
study
the
machine
with
some
calmness
gray
could
not
help
her
out
of
the
side
of
her
eye
she
could
see
where
he
lay
inert
and
senseless
in
passmore
hold
the
lives
of
all
three
depended
on
her
cool
head
at
this
moment
she
remembered
now
all
that
stoddard
had
said
the
morning
he
taught
her
to
run
the
car
with
one
movement
she
threw
off
the
switch
thus
stopping
the
engine
entirely
they
must
make
it
to
cottonville
running
by
gravity
wherever
they
could
since
she
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
there
was
sufficient
gasoline
in
the
tank
and
it
would
not
do
to
be
overtaken
or
waylaid
on
and
on
they
flew
around
quick
turns
along
narrow
ways
that
skirted
tall
bluffs
over
stretches
of
comparatively
level
road
where
johnnie
again
switched
on
the
engine
and
speeded
up
they
were
skimming
down
from
the
upper
unakas
like
a
great
bird
whose
powerful
wings
make
nothing
of
distance
but
johnnie
heart
was
as
lead
when
she
glanced
back
at
the
motionless
figure
in
the
tonneau
the
white
face
that
lay
on
her
uncle
arm
she
turned
doggedly
to
her
and
levers
and
took
greater
chances
than
ever
with
the
going
for
speed
sake
the
boy
they
had
talked
with
two
hours
before
at
the
chip
pile
met
them
afoot
he
leaped
into
the
bushes
to
let
them
pass
and
stared
after
them
with
dilated
eyes
johnnie
never
knew
what
he
shouted
they
only
saw
his
mouth
open
and
working
mercifully
so
far
they
had
met
no
vehicles
but
now
the
higher
wilder
mountains
were
behind
them
there
was
an
occasional
horseman
as
they
neared
cottonville
and
teams
were
numerous
on
the
road
johnnie
jealously
unwilling
to
slacken
speed
kept
the
horn
going
almost
continuously
people
in
wagons
and
buggies
or
on
foot
drawn
out
along
the
roadside
cupped
hands
to
lips
and
yelled
startled
inquiries
johnnie
bent
above
the
and
paid
no
attention
uncle
pros
tried
to
answer
with
gesticulation
or
a
shouted
word
and
sometimes
those
he
replied
to
turned
and
ran
calling
to
others
but
it
was
black
jim
riding
on
roan
sultan
out
with
the
searchers
who
saw
and
understood
he
looked
down
across
the
great
turn
beyond
the
gap
and
sighted
the
climbing
car
where
he
stood
it
was
less
than
an
eighth
of
a
mile
below
him
he
could
almost
have
thrown
a
stone
into
it
he
bent
in
his
saddle
shaded
his
eyes
and
gazed
intently
fo
god
he
muttered
under
his
breath
that
gray
hisself
them
the
clothes
he
was
wearin
whirling
his
horse
and
digging
in
the
spurs
he
rattled
down
the
opposite
steep
toward
cottonville
shouting
as
he
went
they
done
got
him
they
found
him
miss
johnnie
him
down
in
his
own
cyar
at
the
hardwick
place
where
the
front
lawn
sloped
down
with
its
sward
stood
two
horses
charlie
conroy
had
come
out
as
soon
as
the
alarm
was
raised
to
help
with
the
search
he
and
lydia
had
ridden
together
each
day
since
moving
slowly
along
a
quiet
ravine
yesterday
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
the
other
searchers
conroy
had
found
an
intimate
moment
in
which
to
urge
his
suit
she
had
begged
a
little
time
to
consider
with
so
encouraging
an
aspect
that
this
morning
when
he
came
out
that
they
might
join
the
party
bound
for
the
mountains
he
brought
the
ring
in
his
pocket
the
bulge
of
the
big
diamond
showed
through
her
glove
she
had
taken
him
at
last
she
told
herself
that
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
harriet
hardwick
who
had
returned
from
watauga
since
her
sister
would
not
come
to
her
stood
in
the
door
of
the
big
house
regarding
them
with
a
countenance
of
distinctly
chastened
rejoicing
conroy
own
frame
of
mind
was
evident
deep
satisfaction
radiated
from
his
commonplace
countenance
he
was
to
be
jerome
hardwick
an
intimate
member
of
the
mill
crowd
he
was
as
near
being
in
love
with
lydia
sessions
at
that
moment
as
he
ever
would
be
as
for
lydia
herself
the
last
week
had
brought
that
thin
face
of
hers
to
look
all
of
its
thirty
odd
years
and
the
smile
which
she
turned
upon
her
affianced
was
the
product
of
conscientious
effort
she
was
safely
in
her
saddle
and
conroy
had
just
swung
up
to
his
own
when
jim
came
pelting
down
the
gap
road
toward
the
village
they
could
see
him
across
the
slope
of
the
hill
conroy
cantered
hastily
up
the
street
a
bit
to
hear
what
the
boy
was
vociferating
lydia
nerves
quivered
at
sight
of
him
returning
hurrah
hurrah
shouted
conroy
waving
his
cap
lord
lord
did
you
hear
that
lydia
hardwick
did
you
hear
what
jim
saying
they
got
gray
johnnie
consadine
bringing
him
in
his
own
car
then
turning
once
more
to
his
companion
come
on
dear
we
ride
right
down
to
the
hospital
jim
said
he
was
hurt
that
where
she
would
take
him
that
johnnie
consadine
of
yours
is
the
girl
is
she
a
wonder
though
lydia
braced
herself
it
had
come
and
it
was
worse
than
she
could
have
anticipated
she
cringed
inwardly
in
remembrance
she
wished
she
had
not
let
conroy
make
that
pitying
reference
unreproved
uncorrected
to
stoddard
being
a
rejected
man
but
perhaps
they
were
bringing
gray
in
dead
after
all
she
tried
not
to
hope
so
the
auto
became
visible
a
tiny
dark
speck
away
up
in
the
gap
then
it
was
sweeping
down
the
gap
road
and
once
more
conroy
swung
his
cap
and
shouted
though
it
is
to
be
questioned
that
any
one
marked
him
below
in
the
village
the
noisy
clatter
brought
people
to
door
and
casement
at
the
himes
a
group
had
gathered
by
the
gate
at
the
window
above
in
an
sat
a
thin
little
woman
with
great
dark
eyes
holding
a
sick
child
in
her
lap
the
sash
was
up
and
both
were
carefully
wrapped
in
a
big
shawl
that
was
drawn
over
the
two
of
them

up

a

of

reared
itself
to

an

the
next

an

flashed
into

coming
down
the
long

from
the

the
horn
blowing
continuously
horsemen

lydia

conroy
hurrying
down
the
street
drew
up
on
the
fringes
of
the
little
crowd
that
had
gathered
and
was
augmenting
every
moment
and
johnnie
face
was
turned
to
stoddard
in
piteous
questioning
his
eyes
were
open
now
he
raised
himself
a
bit
on
her
uncle
arm
and
declared
in
a
fairly
audible
voice

plainly
the
shackled

supported
she
thrust
the
glass
into
mandy
meacham
hand
and
flung
her
apron
over
her
head
good

mean
pros
had
taken
the
glass
from
mandy
and
held
it
to
gray
lips
then
he
dashed
part
of
the
remaining
water
on
stoddard
handkerchief
and
with
mandy
help
got
the
blood
cleared
away
from
every
shanty

and
nodded
to

uncle
pros
asked
johnnie
we
must
get
stoddard
on
to
his
house
the
women
and
children
drew
back
the
crowd
ahead
parted
and
the
car
got
under
way
once
more
the
entire
press
of
people
followed
in
its
wake
surged
about
it
augmenting
at
every
corner
i
afraid
my
horse
wo
stand
this
sort
of
thing
lydia
objected
desperately
reining
in
conroy
glanced
at
her
in
surprise
bay
dick
was
the
soberest
of
mounts
then
he
looked
wistfully
after
the
crowd
would
you
mind
if
i
he
began
and
broke
off
to
say
contritely
go
back
with
you
if
you
rather
it
was
evident
that
lydia
would
make
of
him
a
thoroughly
disciplined
husband
never
mind
she
said
locking
her
teeth
i
go
with
you
one
might
as
well
have
it
done
and
over
with
and
they
hurried
on
to
make
up
for
lost
time
they
saw
the
car
turn
in
to
the
street
which
led
to
the
hardwick
factory
somebody
had
hurried
ahead
and
told
macpherson
and
jerome
hardwick
and
just
as
they
came
in
sight
the
office
doors
burst
open
and
the
two
men
came
running
hatless
down
the
steps
suddenly
the
factory
whistles
roared
out
the
signal
that
had
been
agreed
upon
which
bellowed
to
the
hills
the
tidings
that
gray
stoddard
was
found
three
long
calls
and
a
short
one
that
meant
that
he
was
found
alive
as
the
din
of
it
died
down
hexter
mills
across
the
creek
took
up
the
message
and
when
they
were
silent
the
old
victory
came
in
on
their
heels
bawling
it
again
every
whistle
in
cottonville
gave
tongue
clamouring
hoarsely
above
the
valley
and
out
across
the
ranges
to
the
hundreds
at
their
futile
search
gray
stoddard
is
found
stoddard
is
found
alive
he
is
brought
in
alive
macpherson
ran
up
to
one
side
of
the
car
and
hardwick
to
the
other
are
you
hurt
inquired
the
scotchman
his
hands
stretched
out
can
you
get
out
and
come
in
hardwick
demanded
eagerly
on
the
instant
the
big
gates
swung
wide
the
factory
poured
out
a
tide
of
people
as
though
the
building
had
been
afire
at
sight
of
stoddard
the
car
and
johnnie
a
cheer
went
up
spontaneous
my
god
look
at
that
macpherson
eyes
had
encountered
the
shackles
on
stoddard
wrists
lift
him
down
lift
him
out
cried
jerome
hardwick
with
tears
on
his
tanned
cheeks
the
scotchman
complied
and
hardwick
eyes
too
were
wet
as
he
saw
it
we
have
those
things
off
of
him
in
no
time
he
shouted
here
let
get
him
in
to
the
couch
in
my
office
send
some
of
the
mechanics
here
where
shade
buckheath
a
dozen
pairs
of
hands
were
stretched
up
to
assist
macpherson
and
pros
passmore
as
many
as
could
get
to
the
rescued
man
helped
and
when
the
crowd
saw
that
shackled
figure
raised
and
heard
in
the
tense
silence
the
clinking
sound
of
the
chains
a
low
groan
went
through
it
more
than
one
woman
sobbed
aloud
but
at
this
gray
raised
his
head
a
bit
and
once
more
declared
in
a
fairly
strong
voice
i
not
hurt
people
only
a
little
crack
on
the
head
i
all
right
thanks
to
her
and
he
motioned
toward
the
girl
in
the
car
who
was
watching
anxiously
then
the
ever
thickening
throng
went
wild
and
as
gray
was
carried
up
the
steps
and
disappeared
through
the
office
doors
it
turned
toward
the
automobile
surging
about
the
car
a
sea
of
friendly
admiring
faces
most
of
them
touched
with
the
tenderness
of
tears
and
cheered
its
very
heart
out
for
johnnie
consadine
chapter
xxv
the
future
gray
it
was
uncle
pros
voice
and
uncle
pros
face
looked
in
at
the
office
door
could
i
bother
you
a
minute
about
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
place
up
yon
hexter
told
me
you
know
whether
the
grade
was
right
and
i
could
let
the
workmen
go
ahead
stoddard
swung
around
from
his
desk
and
looked
at
the
old
man
come
right
in
he
said
i
not
busy
i
just
pretending
this
morning
macpherson
wo
give
me
anything
to
do
he
persists
in
considering
me
still
an
invalid
uncle
pros
came
slowly
in
and
laid
his
hat
down
gingerly
before
seating
himself
he
was
dressed
in
the
garb
which
with
money
he
would
always
have
selected
the
village
ideal
of
a
rich
gentleman
wear
and
he
looked
unbelievably
tall
and
imposing
in
his
black
broadcloth
when
the
matter
of
the
patent
was
made
known
to
jerome
hardwick
a
company
was
hastily
formed
to
take
hold
of
it
which
advanced
the
ready
money
for
johnnie
and
her
family
to
place
themselves
hexter
who
had
been
all
winter
in
boston
had
decided
suddenly
to
go
abroad
and
when
her
husband
wired
her
to
know
if
he
might
let
the
house
to
the
household
she
made
a
quick
warm
response
so
they
were
domiciled
in
a
home
of
elegance
and
beauty
though
the
place
at
cottonville
had
been
only
a
winter
residence
with
hexter
she
was
a
woman
of
taste
and
had
always
had
large
means
at
her
command
with
all
a
child
plasticity
laurella
dropped
into
the
improved
order
of
things
her
cleverness
in
selecting
the
proper
wear
for
herself
and
children
was
nothing
short
of
marvellous
and
her
calm
acceptance
of
the
new
state
of
affairs
the
acme
of
good
breeding
johnnie
immediately
set
about
seeing
that
mavity
bence
and
mandy
meacham
were
comfortably
provided
for
in
the
old
where
she
assured
gray
they
could
do
more
good
than
many
uplift
clubs
we
have
a
there
and
a
couple
of
cows
and
some
chickens
she
said
that
be
good
for
the
table
and
it
give
mandy
the
work
she
loves
to
do
aunt
mavity
can
have
some
help
in
the
house
there
always
a
girl
or
two
breaking
down
in
the
mills
who
would
be
glad
to
have
a
chance
at
housework
for
a
while
now
pros
looked
all
about
him
and
seemed
in
no
haste
to
begin
though
gray
knew
well
there
was
something
on
his
mind
finally
stoddard
observed
smiling
you
the
very
man
i
wanted
to
see
uncle
pros
i
rang
up
the
house
just
now
but
johnnie
said
you
had
started
down
to
the
mills
what
do
you
think
i
found
out
about
our
mine
certainly
the
old
man
looked
very
tall
and
dignified
in
his
new
splendours
but
now
he
was
all
boy
leaning
eagerly
forward
to
half
whisper
i
do
know
what
stoddard
face
was
scarcely
less
animated
as
he
searched
hastily
in
the
of
his
desk
the
patent
might
have
a
company
to
manage
its
affairs
but
the
mine
on
big
unaka
was
sacred
to
these
two
in
whom
the
immortal
urchin
sufficiently
survived
to
make
and
exploiting
delectable
employment
why
uncle
pros
it
is
silver
at
all
it
gray
looked
up
and
caught
the
woeful
drop
of
the
face
before
him
and
hastened
on
to
add
it
better
than
silver
it
nickel
the
price
of
silver
fluctuates
but
the
world
supply
of
nickel
is
limited
and
nickel
a
sure
thing
pros
passmore
leaned
back
in
his
chair
digesting
this
new
bit
of
information
luxuriously
nickel
he
said
reflectively
and
again
he
repeated
the
word
to
himself
nickel
well
i
do
know
but
what
that
finer
leastways
it
likelier
to
say
a
silver
mine
always
seemed
just
like
taking
money
out
of
the
ground
but
then
nickels
are
money
too
and
enough
of
is
all
a
body
needs
these
people
say
the
ore
is
exceptionally
fine
stoddard
had
got
out
the
letter
now
and
was
glancing
over
it
they
sending
down
an
expert
and
you
and
i
will
go
up
with
him
as
soon
as
he
gets
here
there
are
likely
to
be
other
valuable
minerals
as
in
a
nickel
mine
and
we
want
to
build
an
ideal
mining
village
as
well
as
model
cotton
mills
oh
we
got
the
work
cut
out
for
us
and
laid
right
to
hand
if
we
do
do
our
little
share
toward
solving
some
problems
it
will
be
strange
how
things
turns
out
in
this
world
the
old
man
ruminated
ever
sence
i
was
a
little
chap
settin
on
my
granddaddy
knees
by
the
hearth
big
hickory
fire
up
the
chimbly
wind
overhead
an
me
with
my
eyes
like
saucers
to
his
tales
of
the
silver
mine
that
the
injuns
had
ever
sence
that
time
i
hunted
that
thar
mine
he
laughed
chucklingly
deep
in
his
throat
thar
was
a
that
could
have
a
hideout
safe
from
me
they
just
had
to
trust
me
i
crawled
into
every
hole
i
came
mighty
near
the
end
of
every
cave
but
one
and
that
cave
was
the
one
whar
my
mammy
kept
her
milk
and
butter
the
springhouse
whar
they
put
you
in
prison
somehow
i
never
did
think
about
goin
to
the
end
of
that
looked
like
it
was
too
near
home
to
have
a
silver
mine
in
it
and
thar
the
stuff
lay
and
waited
for
the
day
when
i
should
take
a
notion
to
find
a
pretty
rock
for
deanie
and
crawl
back
in
thar
and
keep
a
crawlin
till
i
just
fell
over
it
all
croppin
out
in
the
biggest
kind
of
vein
gray
had
heard
uncle
pros
tell
the
story
many
times
but
it
had
a
perennial
charm
then
i
lost
six
months
plumb
lost
you
know
and
time
i
come
to
myself
johnnie
an
me
was
for
you
and
there
we
found
you
shut
in
that
thar
same
cave
and
i
was
so
tuck
up
with
that
matter
that
i
never
once
thought
till
i
got
you
home
to
wonder
did
buckheath
and
the
rest
of
know
that
they
penned
you
in
the
silver
mine
i
never
asked
you
but
you
have
knowed
if
they
had
i
should
have
known
anything
that
rudd
dawson
or
groner
or
venters
knew
gray
said
but
i
not
sure
about
buckheath
or
himes
however
himes
is
dead
and
buckheath
i
do
suppose
anybody
in
cottonville
will
ever
see
him
again
pros
face
changed
instantly
he
leaned
abruptly
forward
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
other
knee
that
exactly
what
i
came
down
here
to
speak
with
you
about
gray
he
said
they
fetched
shade
buckheath
in
now
what
do
you
make
out
of
that
stoddard
shoved
the
letter
from
the
eastern
mining
man
back
in
its
well
he
said
slowly
i
did
expect
that
i
thought
of
course
shade
was
safely
out
of
the
country
i
passmore
i
sorry
they
got
him
after
a
little
silence
he
spoke
again
what
do
i
make
of
it
why
that
there
are
some
folks
up
on
big
unaka
who
need
pretty
badly
to
appear
as
very
citizens
i
wager
anything
that
groner
and
rudd
dawson
brought
shade
in
uncle
pros
nodded
seriously
them
the
very
fellers
he
said
reckon
they
talked
pretty
free
to
you
i
never
axed
ye
gray
how
did
they
treat
ye
dawson
was
the
best
friend
i
had
stoddard
returned
promptly
when
i
got
to
the
big
turn
on
sultan
coming
home
that
friday
morning
buckheath
met
me
and
asked
me
to
go
down
to
burnt
cabin
and
help
him
with
a
man
that
had
fallen
and
hurt
himself
on
the
rocks
dawson
told
me
afterward
that
he
and
jesse
groner
were
posted
at
the
roadside
to
stop
me
and
hem
me
in
before
i
got
to
the
bluff
described
to
you
how
buckheath
tried
to
back
sultan
over
the
edge
and
i
got
off
on
the
side
where
the
two
were
not
noticing
them
till
they
tied
me
hand
and
foot
they
almost
came
to
a
clinch
with
buckheath
then
and
there
you
ought
to
have
heard
groner
swear
it
was
like
praying
gone
wrong
agreed
pros
jess
is
a
terrible
wicked
man
in
speech
but
he
that
first
scrimmage
showed
me
just
what
the
men
were
after
stoddard
said
buckheath
plainly
wanted
me
put
out
of
the
way
but
the
others
had
some
vague
idea
of
holding
me
for
a
ransom
and
getting
money
out
of
the
hardwicks
dawson
complained
always
that
he
thought
the
mills
owed
him
money
he
said
they
must
have
sold
his
girl
body
for
as
much
as
a
hundred
dollars
and
he
felt
that
he
been
cheated
oh
it
was
all
crazy
stuff
but
he
and
the
others
had
justified
themselves
and
they
had
no
notion
of
standing
for
what
buckheath
was
after
i
was
one
of
the
men
to
them
they
had
no
personal
malice
through
the
long
evenings
when
groner
or
dawson
or
will
venters
was
guarding
me
or
maybe
all
three
of
them
we
used
to
talk
and
it
surprised
me
to
find
how
simple
and
childish
those
fellows
were
they
were
as
kind
to
me
as
though
i
had
been
a
brother
and
treated
me
courteously
always
little
by
little
i
got
at
the
whole
thing
from
them
it
seems
that
buckheath
took
advantage
of
the
feeling
there
was
in
the
mountains
against
the
mill
men
on
account
of
the
hospital
and
some
other
matters
he
went
up
there
and
interviewed
anybody
that
he
thought
might
join
him
in
a
vendetta
i
imagine
he
found
plenty
of
them
that
were
ready
to
talk
and
some
that
were
willing
to
do
but
it
chanced
that
dawson
and
jesse
groner
were
coming
down
to
cottonville
that
morning
i
passed
buckheath
at
the
hardwick
gate
and
he
must
have
cut
across
the
turn
and
followed
me
intending
to
pick
a
quarrel
then
he
met
dawson
and
groner
and
framed
up
this
other
plan
with
their
assistance
uncle
pros
i
want
you
to
help
me
out
if
buckheath
has
to
stand
trial
how
are
we
any
of
us
going
to
testify
without
making
it
hard
on
the
dawson
crowd
i
expect
to
live
here
the
rest
of
my
days
here
this
mine
of
ours
and
right
here
i
mean
to
build
a
big
mill
and
work
out
my
plans
i
think
you
know
that
i
hope
to
marry
a
mountain
wife
and
i
ca
afford
to
quarrel
with
those
folks
uncle
pros
chin
dropped
to
his
breast
his
eyes
half
closed
as
he
sat
thinking
intently
well
he
said
finally
they
wo
have
nothing
worse
than
manslaughter
against
shade
it
ca
be
proved
that
he
intended
to
shoot
pap
he
did
if
he
was
shootin
after
us
there
the
thing
we
do
want
to
bring
up
you
was
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
cyar
an
i
had
my
back
to
him
and
so
did
johnnie
and
we
do
know
anything
about
what
was
done
ai
that
so
as
for
you
you
already
told
hardwick
and
the
others
that
you
was
taken
prisoner
and
detained
by
parties
unknown
johnnie
an
me
was
gettin
you
out
of
the
springhouse
and
away
in
the
machine
then
gid
and
shade
comes
up
and
thinkin
the
other
crowd
stealin
the
machine
they
try
to
catch
us
and
turn
loose
at
us
that
makes
a
pretty
good
story
do
it
it
does
if
dawson
and
groner
and
venters
agree
to
it
stoddard
laughed
but
somebody
will
have
to
communicate
with
them
before
they
tell
another
one
or
several
others
i
see
to
that
gray
pros
said
rising
and
preparing
to
go
boy
he
looked
down
fondly
at
the
younger
man
and
set
a
brown
right
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
never
done
a
wiser
thing
nor
a
kinder
in
your
life
than
when
you
forgave
your
enemies
that
time
i
bet
you
could
ride
the
unakas
from
end
to
end
the
balance
o
your
days
the
safest
man
that
ever
travelled
their
trails
talking
silver
mine
inquired
macpherson
putting
his
quizzical
face
in
at
the
door
no
returned
stoddard
we
were
just
mentioning
my
pestilent
projects
by
this
time
next
year
you
and
hardwick
will
be
wanting
to
have
me
abated
as
a
nuisance
no
no
remonstrated
macpherson
coming
in
and
leaning
with
affectionate
familiarity
on
the
younger
man
chair
there
no
pestilence
in
you
gray
you
could
be
a
nuisance
if
you
tried
people
who
will
work
out
their
theories
stand
to
do
good
in
the
world
only
the
fellows
who
are
content
with
bellowing
them
out
that
i
object
to
better
be
careful
laughed
stoddard
we
make
you
of
the
company
is
that
an
offer
countered
macpherson
swiftly
i
got
a
bit
of
money
to
invest
in
this
county
and
hardwick
has
ever
a
new
or
such
that
looks
longingly
at
my
shoes
you
furnish
the
conservative
element
surely
debated
stoddard
i
keep
you
from
bankruptcy
grunted
the
scotchman
as
he
laid
a
small
book
on
gray
desk
i
doubt
not
providence
demands
it
of
me
evening
was
closing
in
with
a
sunset
and
a
big
full
moon
pushing
up
to
whiten
the
sky
above
it
it
was
late
march
now
and
the
air
was
full
of
vernal
promise
johnnie
stepped
out
on
the
porch
and
glanced
toward
the
west
she
was
expecting
gray
that
evening
would
there
be
time
before
he
came
she
wondered
for
a
little
errand
she
wanted
to
do
turning
back
into
the
hall
she
caught
a
jacket
from
the
hook
where
it
hung
and
hurried
down
to
the
gate
settling
her
arms
in
the
sleeves
as
she
ran
there
would
be
time
if
she
went
fast
she
wished
to
get
the
little
packet
into
which
she
had
made
gray
letters
months
ago
dreading
to
look
even
at
the
folded
outsides
of
them
tucking
them
away
on
the
high
shelf
of
her
at
the
pap
himes
and
trying
to
forget
them
nobody
would
know
where
to
look
but
herself
she
got
permission
from
mavity
to
go
upstairs
once
there
the
letters
made
their
own
plea
and
alone
in
the
little
room
that
was
lately
her
own
she
opened
the
packet
carrying
the
contents
to
the
fading
light
and
glancing
over
sheet
after
sheet
she
knew
them
all
by
heart
how
often
she
had
stood
at
that
very
window
devouring
these
same
words
not
realizing
then
as
she
did
now
what
deep
meaning
was
in
each
phrase
how
the
feeling
expressed
increased
from
the
first
to
the
last
across
the
ravine
one
of
the
loom
fixers
found
the
evening
warm
enough
to
sit
on
the
porch
playing
his
guitar
the
sound
of
the
twanging
strings
and
the
appealing
vibration
of
his
young
voice
in
a
plaintive
minor
air
came
over
to
her
she
gathered
the
sheets
together
and
pressed
them
to
her
face
as
though
they
were
flowers
or
the
hands
of
little
children
i
got
to
tell
him
she
whispered
to
herself
in
the
dusky
small
dismantled
room
i
got
to
get
him
to
see
it
as
i
do
i
must
make
myself
worthy
of
him
before
i
let
him
take
me
for
his
own
she
thrust
the
letters
into
the
of
her
coat
and
ran
downstairs
mavity
bence
stood
in
the
hall
plainly
awaiting
her
honey
she
began
fondly
i
been
putting
away
pap
things
jest
like
you
oncet
found
me
putting
away
lou
i
came
on
this
here
and
then
johnnie
noticed
a
folded
bandanna
in
her
hands
asked
me
to
let
ye
go
through
and
find
that
nickel
ore
and
ye
brung
it
out
in
a
pasteboard
box
but
this
here
is
what
it
was
in
on
the
day
your
uncle
pros
fetched
hit
here
and
i
thought
maybe
you
take
a
interest
in
having
the
handkercher
that
your
fortune
come
down
the
mountains
in
yes
indeed
aunt
mavity
said
johnnie
taking
the
bandanna
into
her
own
hands
pap
he
gone
the
poor
woman
went
on
tremulously
an
the
evil
what
he
done
or
wanted
to
do
is
a
thing
that
i
reckon
you
can
afford
to
forget
you
a
mighty
happy
woman
johnnie
consadine
the
lord
knows
you
deserve
to
be
she
stood
looking
after
the
girl
as
she
went
out
into
the
twilit
street
johnnie
was
dressed
as
she
chose
now
not
as
she
must
and
her
clothing
showed
itself
to
be
of
the
best
anything
that
might
be
had
in
wautaga
was
within
her
means
and
the
tall
graceful
figure
passing
so
quietly
down
the
street
would
never
have
been
taken
for
other
than
a
member
of
what
we
are
learning
to
call
the
leisure
class
when
the
shadows
at
the
end
of
the
block
swallowed
her
up
mavity
turned
wiping
her
eyes
and
addressed
herself
to
her
tasks
i
reckon
lou
would
been
just
like
that
if
she
lived
she
said
to
mandy
meacham
with
the
tender
fatuity
of
mothers
johnnie
seems
like
a
daughter
to
me
an
i
know
in
my
soul
no
daughter
could
be
kinder
look
at
her
makin
me
keep
every
cent
pap
had
in
the
bank
when
laurelly
could
have
claimed
it
all
and
kep
it
yes
an
addin
somethin
to
it
put
in
mandy
i
do
love
both
johnnie
an
deanie
ef
i
ever
was
so
fortunate
as
to
get
a
man
and
be
wedded
and
have
chaps
o
my
own
i
know
mighty
well
and
good
i
could
love
any
one
of
any
better
than
i
do
deanie
an
yet
johnnie
quare
i
always
will
say
that
johnnie
consadine
is
quare
what
in
the
nation
does
she
want
to
go
chasin
off
to
yurrup
for
when
got
everything
that
heart
could
desire
or
mind
think
of
right
here
in
cottonville
that
same
question
was
being
put
even
more
searchingly
to
johnnie
by
somebody
else
at
the
instant
when
mandy
enunciated
it
she
had
found
gray
waiting
for
her
at
the
gate
of
her
home
let
walk
here
a
little
while
before
we
go
in
he
suggested
i
went
up
to
the
house
and
found
you
were
out
the
air
is
delightful
and
got
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
he
had
put
his
arm
under
hers
and
they
strolled
together
down
the
long
walk
that
led
to
the
front
of
the
lawn
the
evening
air
was
pure
and
keen
tingling
with
the
breath
of
the
wakening
season
sweetheart
gray
broke
out
suddenly
i
been
thinking
day
and
night
since
we
last
talked
together
about
this
year
abroad
that
planning
i
certainly
do
want
to
put
my
preferences
before
yours
i
only
want
to
be
very
sure
that
i
know
what
your
real
preferences
are
and
he
turned
and
searched
her
face
with
a
pair
of
ardent
eyes
i
think
i
ought
to
go
the
girl
said
in
a
very
low
voice
her
head
drooped
her
own
eyes
bent
toward
the
path
at
her
feet
why
whispered
her
lover
i
oh
gray
you
know
if
we
should
ever
be
married
well
then
in
answer
to
a
swift
impatient
exclamation
when
we
are
married
if
you
should
show
that
you
were
ashamed
of
me
i
think
it
would
kill
me
no
do
say
there
not
any
danger
you
might
have
plenty
of
reason
and
i
i
want
to
be
safe
gray
safe
if
i
can
gray
regarded
the
beautiful
anxious
face
long
and
thoughtfully
yes
of
course
it
was
possible
for
her
to
feel
that
way
assurance
was
so
deep
and
perfect
in
his
own
heart
that
he
had
not
reflected
what
it
might
lack
in
hers
dear
girl
he
said
pausing
and
making
her
look
at
him
how
little
you
do
know
of
me
after
all
do
i
care
so
much
for
what
people
say
are
you
always
having
to
reprove
me
because
i
so
persistently
like
what
i
like
without
reference
to
the
opinions
of
the
world
besides
you
a
beauty
with
tender
brusqueness
and
a
charmer
that
steals
the
hearts
of
men
if
you
do
know
all
this
it
is
from
lack
of
telling
moreover
i
can
keep
on
informing
you
a
year
of
european
travel
could
not
make
you
any
more
beautiful
johnnie
or
sweeter
you
may
not
believe
me
but
there
little
the
capitals
could
add
to
your
native
bearing
you
must
have
learned
that
simple
dignity
from
these
mountains
of
yours
of
course
if
you
wanted
to
go
for
pleasure
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
he
regarded
her
with
a
tender
smile
hoping
he
had
sounded
the
note
that
would
bring
him
swift
surrender
it
is
altogether
for
myself
there
are
the
others
johnnie
told
him
lifting
honest
eyes
to
his
in
the
dim
moonlight
they
all
i
had
in
the
world
gray
till
you
came
into
my
life
and
i
must
keep
my
own
i
belong
to
a
people
who
never
give
up
anything
they
love
stoddard
dropped
an
arm
about
his
beloved
and
turned
her
that
she
might
face
the
windows
of
the
house
behind
them
bending
to
set
his
cheek
against
hers
and
direct
her
gaze
look
there
he
whispered
laughingly
she
looked
and
saw
her
mother
clad
in
such
wear
as
laurella
taste
could
select
and
laurella
beauty
make
effective
the
slight
dark
little
woman
was
coming
in
from
the
dining
room
with
her
children
all
about
her
a
noble
group
your
mother
is
much
more
the
fine
lady
than
you
ever
be
johnnie
stoddard
gray
said
giving
her
the
name
that
always
brought
the
blood
to
the
girl
cheek
and
made
her
dumb
before
him
you
know
your
uncle
pros
and
i
are
warmly
attached
to
each
other
what
is
it
you
be
waiting
for
girl
why
johnnie
a
man
has
just
so
long
to
live
on
this
earth
and
the
years
in
which
he
has
loved
are
the
only
years
that
count
would
you
be
throwing
one
of
these
away
a
year
twelve
months
three
hundred
and
days
cast
to
the
void
you
reckless
creature
he
cupped
his
hands
about
her
beautiful
fair
face
and
lifted
it
studying
it
johnnie
johnnie
johnnie
stoddard
the
one
woman
out
of
all
the
world
for
me
he
murmured
his
deep
voice
dropping
to
a
wooing
cadence
i
could
love
you
better
i
shall
never
love
you
less
do
let
us
foolishly
throw
away
a
year
out
of
the
days
which
will
be
vouchsafed
us
together
do
do
it
darling
it
folly
johnnie
made
only
a
sort
of
inarticulate
response
come
love
sit
a
moment
with
me
here
pleaded
gray
indicating
a
small
bench
hidden
among
the
evergreens
and
shrubs
at
the
end
of
the
path
sit
down
and
let
reason
this
thing
out
reasoning
with
you
began
johnnie
helplessly
is
it
reasonable
it
is
he
told
her
in
that
deep
masterful
tone
which
like
a
true
woman
she
both
loved
and
dreaded
it
the
height
of
reasonableness
why
dear
the
great
primal
reason
of
all
things
speaks
through
me
and
i
wo
let
you
throw
away
a
year
of
our
love
johnnie
it
is
as
though
we
been
neighbours
and
grown
up
side
by
side
i
came
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
find
you
darling
and
i
knew
my
own
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
he
put
out
his
arms
and
gathered
her
into
a
close
embrace
for
a
space
they
rested
so
murmuring
question
and
reply
checked
or
answered
by
swift
sweet
kisses
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
you
love
oh
in
thoze
dusty
old
shoes
and
a
sunbonnet
could
you
love
me
then
gray
the
same
as
at
this
moment
sweetheart
shoes
and
sunbonnets
ashamed
of
you
now
johnnie
in
earnest
what
do
such
things
matter
and
that
morning
on
the
mountain
when
we
got
the
moccasin
flowers
the
girl
voice
took
up
the
theme
i
it
was
sweet
to
be
with
you
and
bitter
too
i
could
not
dream
then
that
you
were
for
me
and
afterward
the
long
black
dreadful
time
when
you
seemed
so
utterly
lost
to
me
at
the
mention
of
those
months
gray
stopped
her
words
with
a
kiss
mine
he
