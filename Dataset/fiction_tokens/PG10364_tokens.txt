a
problem
preface
to
the
fourth
edition
this
book
was
written
nearly
twelve
years
ago
and
so
many
things
have
changed
since
then
that
it
is
hardly
fair
to
send
it
into
the
world
afresh
without
some
notice
of
the
improvement
if
such
there
be
which
has
taken
place
meanwhile
in
those
southern
counties
of
england
with
which
alone
this
book
deals
i
believe
that
things
are
improved
twelve
years
more
of
the
new
poor
law
have
taught
the
labouring
men
greater
and
independence
i
hope
that
those
virtues
may
not
be
destroyed
in
them
once
more
by
the
boundless
and
indiscriminate
almsgiving
which
has
become
the
fashion
of
the
day
in
most
parishes
where
there
are
resident
gentry
if
half
the
money
which
is
now
given
away
in
different
forms
to
the
agricultural
poor
could
be
spent
in
making
their
dwellings
fit
for
honest
men
to
live
in
then
life
morals
and
would
be
saved
to
an
immense
amount
but
as
i
do
not
see
how
to
carry
out
such
a
plan
i
have
no
right
to
complain
of
others
for
not
seeing
meanwhile
cottage
improvement
and
sanitary
reform
throughout
the
country
districts
are
going
on
at
a
fearfully
slow
rate
here
and
there
landlords
like
the
duke
of
bedford
are
doing
their
duty
like
men
but
in
general
the
apathy
of
the
educated
classes
is
most
disgraceful
but
the
labourers
during
the
last
ten
years
are
altogether
better
off
free
trade
has
increased
their
food
without
lessening
their
employment
the
politician
who
wishes
to
know
the
effect
on
agricultural
life
of
that
wise
and
just
measure
may
find
it
in
grey
of
dilston
answers
to
the
queries
of
the
french
government
the
country
parson
will
not
need
to
seek
so
far
he
will
see
it
if
he
be
an
observant
man
in
the
faces
and
figures
of
his
children
he
will
see
a
rosier
fatter
race
growing
up
which
bids
fair
to
surpass
in
bulk
the
puny
and
generation
of
and
equal
perhaps
in
thew
and
sinew
to
the
men
who
saved
europe
in
the
old
french
war
if
it
should
be
so
as
god
grant
it
may
there
is
little
fear
but
that
the
labouring
men
of
england
will
find
their
aristocracy
able
to
lead
them
in
the
and
to
develop
the
agriculture
of
the
land
at
home
even
better
than
did
their
grandfathers
of
the
old
war
time
to
a
thoughtful
man
no
point
of
the
social
horizon
is
more
full
of
light
than
the
altered
temper
of
the
young
gentlemen
they
have
their
faults
and
follies
still
for
when
will
young
blood
be
other
than
hot
blood
but
when
one
finds
more
and
more
swearing
banished
from
the
foul
songs
from
the
universities
drunkenness
and
gambling
from
the
barracks
when
one
finds
everywhere
whether
at
college
in
camp
or
by
the
more
and
more
young
men
desirous
to
learn
their
duty
as
englishmen
and
if
possible
to
do
it
when
one
hears
their
altered
tone
toward
the
middle
classes
and
that
word
thanks
very
much
to
thackeray
used
by
them
in
its
true
sense
without
regard
of
rank
when
one
watches
as
at
aldershott
the
care
and
kindness
of
officers
toward
their
men
and
over
and
above
all
this
when
one
finds
in
every
profession
in
that
of
the
soldier
as
much
as
any
young
men
who
are
not
only
the
world
but
in
religious
phraseology
the
world
living
virtuous
and
useful
lives
as
christian
men
should
then
indeed
one
looks
forward
with
hope
and
confidence
to
the
day
when
these
men
shall
settle
down
in
life
and
become
as
holders
of
the
land
the
leaders
of
agricultural
progress
and
the
guides
and
guardians
of
the
labouring
man
i
am
bound
to
speak
of
the
farmer
as
i
know
him
in
the
south
of
england
in
the
north
he
is
a
man
of
altogether
higher
education
and
breeding
but
he
is
even
in
the
south
a
much
better
man
than
it
is
the
fashion
to
believe
him
no
doubt
he
has
given
heavy
cause
of
complaint
he
was
demoralised
as
surely
if
not
as
deeply
as
his
own
labourers
by
the
old
poor
law
he
was
bewildered
to
use
the
mildest
term
by
promises
of
protection
from
men
who
knew
better
but
his
worst
fault
after
all
has
been
that
young
or
old
he
has
copied
his
landlord
too
closely
and
acted
on
his
maxims
and
example
and
now
that
his
landlord
is
growing
wiser
he
is
growing
wiser
too
experience
of
the
new
poor
law
and
experience
of
are
helping
him
to
show
himself
what
he
always
was
at
heart
an
honest
englishman
all
his
brave
persistence
and
industry
his
sturdy
independence
and
and
last
but
not
least
his
strong
sense
of
justice
and
his
vast
nature
are
coming
out
more
and
more
and
working
better
and
better
upon
the
land
and
the
labourer
while
among
his
sons
i
see
many
growing
up
brave
manly
prudent
young
men
with
a
steadily
increasing
knowledge
of
what
is
required
of
them
both
as
manufacturers
of
food
and
employers
of
human
labour
the
country
clergy
again
are
steadily
improving
i
do
not
mean
merely
in
morality
for
public
opinion
now
demands
that
as
a
sine
qua
non
but
in
actual
efficiency
every
fresh
appointment
seems
to
me
on
the
whole
a
better
one
than
the
last
they
are
gaining
more
and
more
the
love
and
respect
of
their
flocks
they
are
becoming
more
and
more
centres
of
civilisation
and
morality
to
their
parishes
they
are
working
for
the
most
part
very
hard
each
in
his
own
way
indeed
their
great
danger
is
that
they
should
trust
too
much
in
that
outward
work
which
they
do
so
heartily
that
they
should
fancy
that
the
administration
of
schools
and
charities
is
their
chief
business
and
literally
leave
the
word
of
god
to
serve
tables
would
that
we
clergymen
could
learn
some
of
us
are
learning
already
that
influence
over
our
people
is
not
to
be
gained
by
perpetual
interference
in
their
private
affairs
too
often
inquisitorial
irritating
and
degrading
to
both
parties
but
by
showing
ourselves
their
personal
friends
of
like
passions
with
them
let
a
priest
do
that
let
us
make
our
people
feel
that
we
speak
to
them
and
feel
to
them
as
men
to
men
and
then
the
more
cottages
we
enter
the
better
if
we
go
into
our
neighbours
houses
only
as
judges
inquisitors
or
at
best
gossips
we
are
best
as
too
many
are
at
home
in
our
studies
would
too
that
we
would
recollect
this
that
our
duty
is
among
other
things
to
preach
the
gospel
and
consider
firstly
whether
what
we
commonly
preach
be
any
gospel
or
good
news
at
all
and
not
rather
the
worst
possible
news
and
secondly
whether
we
preach
at
all
whether
our
sermons
are
not
utterly
unintelligible
being
delivered
in
an
unknown
tongue
and
also
of
a
dulness
not
to
be
surpassed
and
whether
therefore
it
might
not
be
worth
our
while
to
spend
a
little
time
in
studying
the
english
tongue
and
the
art
of
touching
human
hearts
and
minds
but
to
return
this
improved
tone
if
the
truth
must
be
told
is
owing
far
more
than
people
themselves
are
aware
to
the
triumphs
of
those
liberal
principles
for
which
the
whigs
have
fought
for
the
last
forty
years
and
of
that
sounder
natural
philosophy
of
which
they
have
been
the
consistent
patrons
england
has
become
whig
and
the
death
of
the
whig
party
is
the
best
proof
of
its
victory
it
has
ceased
to
exist
because
it
has
done
its
work
because
its
principles
are
accepted
by
its
ancient
enemies
because
the
political
economy
and
the
physical
science
which
grew
up
under
its
patronage
are
leavening
the
thoughts
and
acts
of
anglican
and
of
evangelical
alike
and
supplying
them
with
methods
for
carrying
out
their
own
schemes
lord
shaftesbury
truly
noble
speech
on
sanitary
reform
at
liverpool
is
a
striking
proof
of
the
extent
to
which
the
evangelical
leaders
have
given
in
their
adherence
to
those
scientific
laws
the
original
preachers
of
which
have
been
called
by
his
lordship
party
heretics
and
infidels
materialists
and
rationalists
be
it
so
provided
truth
be
preached
what
matter
who
preaches
it
provided
the
leaven
of
sound
inductive
science
leaven
the
whole
lump
what
matter
who
sets
it
working
better
perhaps
because
more
likely
to
produce
practical
success
that
these
novel
truths
should
be
instilled
into
the
minds
of
the
educated
classes
by
men
who
share
somewhat
in
their
prejudices
and
superstitions
and
doled
out
to
them
in
such
measure
as
will
not
terrify
or
disgust
them
the
child
will
take
its
medicine
from
the
nurse
hand
trustfully
enough
when
it
would
scream
itself
into
convulsions
at
the
sight
of
the
doctor
and
so
do
itself
more
harm
than
the
medicine
would
do
it
good
the
doctor
meanwhile
unless
he
be
one
of
hesiod
who
know
not
how
much
more
half
is
than
the
whole
is
content
enough
to
see
any
part
of
his
prescription
got
down
by
any
hands
whatsoever
but
there
is
another
cause
for
the
improved
tone
of
the
landlord
class
and
of
the
young
men
of
what
is
commonly
called
the
aristocracy
and
that
is
a
growing
moral
earnestness
which
is
in
great
part
owing
that
justice
may
be
done
on
all
sides
to
the
anglican
movement
how
much
soever
may
have
failed
as
an
ecclesiastical
or
theological
system
how
much
soever
it
may
have
proved
itself
both
by
the
national
dislike
of
it
and
by
the
defection
of
all
its
to
be
radically
it
has
at
least
awakened
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
cultivated
men
and
women
to
ask
themselves
whether
god
sent
them
into
the
world
merely
to
eat
drink
and
be
merry
and
to
have
souls
saved
upon
the
spurgeon
method
after
they
die
and
has
taught
them
an
answer
to
that
question
not
unworthy
of
english
christians
the
anglican
movement
when
it
dies
out
will
leave
behind
at
least
a
legacy
of
grand
old
authors
disinterred
of
art
of
music
of
churches
too
schools
cottages
and
charitable
institutions
which
will
form
so
many
centres
of
future
civilisation
and
will
entitle
it
to
the
respect
if
not
to
the
allegiance
of
the
future
generation
and
more
than
this
it
has
sown
in
the
hearts
of
young
gentlemen
and
young
ladies
seed
which
will
not
perish
which
though
it
may
develop
into
forms
little
expected
by
those
who
sowed
it
will
develop
at
least
into
a
virtue
more
stately
and
reverent
more
chivalrous
and
more
genial
and
human
than
can
be
learnt
from
that
religion
of
the
stock
exchange
which
reigned
triumphant
for
a
year
and
a
day
in
the
popular
pulpits
i
have
said
that
has
proved
a
failure
as
anglicanism
did
the
causes
of
that
failure
this
book
has
tried
to
point
out
and
not
one
word
which
is
spoken
of
it
therein
but
has
been
drawn
from
personal
and
experience
but
now
peace
to
its
ashes
is
it
so
great
a
sin
to
have
been
dazzled
by
the
splendour
of
an
impossible
ideal
is
it
so
great
a
sin
to
have
had
courage
and
conduct
enough
to
attempt
the
enforcing
of
that
ideal
in
the
face
of
the
prejudices
of
a
whole
nation
and
if
that
ideal
was
too
narrow
for
the
english
nation
and
for
the
modern
needs
of
mankind
is
that
either
so
great
a
sin
are
other
extant
ideals
then
so
very
comprehensive
does
spurgeon
then
take
so
much
broader
or
nobler
views
of
the
capacities
and
destinies
of
his
race
than
that
great
genius
john
henry
newman
if
the
world
can
not
answer
that
question
now
it
will
answer
it
promptly
enough
in
another
years
and
meanwhile
let
not
the
party
and
the
system
which
has
conquered
boast
itself
too
loudly
let
it
take
warning
by
the
whigs
and
suspect
as
many
a
more
than
suspects
that
its
triumph
may
be
as
with
the
whigs
its
ruin
and
that
having
done
the
work
for
which
it
was
sent
into
the
world
there
may
only
remain
for
it
to
decay
and
die
and
die
it
surely
will
if
as
seems
too
probable
there
succeeds
to
this
late
thirty
years
of
peace
a
thirty
years
of
storm
for
it
has
lost
all
hold
upon
the
young
the
active
the
daring
it
has
sunk
into
a
compromise
between
originally
opposite
dogmas
it
has
become
a
religion
for
jacob
the
smooth
man
adapted
to
the
maxims
of
the
market
and
leaving
him
full
liberty
to
supplant
his
brother
by
all
methods
lawful
in
that
market
no
longer
can
it
embrace
and
explain
all
known
facts
of
god
and
man
in
heaven
and
earth
and
satisfy
utterly
such
minds
and
hearts
as
those
of
cromwell
ironsides
or
the
scotch
covenanters
or
even
of
a
newton
and
a
colonel
gardiner
let
it
make
the
most
of
its
hedley
vicars
and
its
havelock
and
sound
its
own
trumpet
as
loudly
as
it
can
in
sounding
theirs
for
they
are
the
last
specimens
of
heroism
which
it
is
likely
to
beget
if
indeed
it
did
in
any
true
sense
beget
them
and
if
their
gallantry
was
really
owing
to
their
creed
and
not
to
the
simple
fact
of
their
being
like
others
english
gentlemen
well
may
jacob
chaplains
cackle
in
delighted
surprise
over
their
noble
memories
like
geese
who
have
unwittingly
hatched
a
swan
but
on
esau
in
general
on
poor
rough
esau
who
sails
jacob
ships
digs
jacob
mines
founds
jacob
colonies
pours
out
his
blood
for
him
in
those
wars
which
jacob
himself
has
stirred
up
while
his
sleek
brother
sits
at
home
in
his
enjoying
at
once
means
of
grace
and
the
produce
of
esau
labour
on
him
jacob
chaplains
have
less
and
less
influence
for
him
they
have
less
and
less
good
news
he
is
afraid
of
them
and
they
of
him
the
two
do
not
comprehend
one
another
sympathise
with
one
another
they
do
not
even
understand
one
another
speech
the
same
social
and
moral
gulf
has
opened
between
them
as
parted
the
cultivated
and
wealthy
pharisee
of
jerusalem
from
the
rough
fishers
of
the
galilaean
lake
and
yet
the
galilaean
fishers
if
we
are
to
trust
josephus
and
the
gospels
were
trusty
generous
it
was
not
from
among
the
pharisees
it
is
said
that
the
apostles
were
chosen
be
that
as
it
may
esau
has
a
birthright
and
this
book
like
all
books
which
i
have
ever
written
is
written
to
tell
him
so
and
i
trust
has
not
been
written
in
vain
but
it
is
not
this
book
or
any
man
book
or
any
man
at
all
who
can
tell
esau
the
whole
truth
about
himself
his
powers
his
duty
and
his
god
woman
must
do
it
and
not
man
his
mother
his
sister
the
maid
whom
he
may
love
and
failing
all
these
as
they
often
will
fail
him
in
the
wild
wandering
life
which
he
must
live
those
human
angels
of
whom
it
is
written
barren
hath
many
more
children
than
she
who
has
an
husband
and
such
will
not
be
wanting
as
long
as
england
can
produce
at
once
two
such
women
as
florence
nightingale
and
catherine
marsh
there
is
good
hope
that
esau
will
not
be
defrauded
of
his
birthright
and
that
by
the
time
that
jacob
comes
crouching
to
him
to
defend
him
against
the
enemies
who
are
near
at
hand
esau
instead
of
borrowing
jacob
religion
may
be
able
to
teach
jacob
his
and
the
two
brothers
face
together
the
superstition
and
anarchy
of
europe
in
the
strength
of
a
lofty
and
enlightened
christianity
which
shall
be
thoroughly
human
and
therefore
thoroughly
divine
february
preface
to
the
first
edition
this
little
tale
was
written
between
two
and
three
years
ago
in
the
hope
that
it
might
help
to
call
the
attention
of
wiser
and
better
men
than
i
am
to
the
questions
which
are
now
agitating
the
minds
of
the
rising
generation
and
to
the
absolute
necessity
of
solving
them
at
once
and
earnestly
unless
we
would
see
the
faith
of
our
forefathers
crumble
away
beneath
the
combined
influence
of
new
truths
which
are
fancied
to
be
incompatible
with
it
and
new
mistakes
as
to
its
real
essence
that
this
can
be
done
i
believe
and
know
if
i
had
not
believed
it
i
would
never
have
put
pen
to
paper
on
the
subject
i
believe
that
the
ancient
creed
the
eternal
gospel
will
stand
and
conquer
and
prove
its
might
in
this
age
as
it
has
in
every
other
for
eighteen
hundred
years
by
claiming
and
subduing
and
organising
those
young
anarchic
forces
which
now
unconscious
of
their
parentage
rebel
against
him
to
whom
they
owe
their
being
but
for
the
time
being
the
young
men
and
women
of
our
day
are
fast
parting
from
their
parents
and
each
other
the
more
thoughtful
are
wandering
either
towards
rome
towards
sheer
materialism
or
towards
an
unchristian
and
unphilosophic
spiritualism
epicurism
which
in
my
eyes
is
the
worst
evil
spirit
of
the
three
precisely
because
it
looks
at
first
sight
most
like
an
angel
of
light
the
mass
again
are
fancying
that
they
are
still
adhering
to
the
old
creeds
the
old
church
to
the
honoured
patriarchs
of
english
protestantism
i
wish
i
could
agree
with
them
in
their
belief
about
themselves
to
me
they
seem
with
a
small
sprinkling
of
those
noble
and
cheering
exceptions
to
popular
error
which
are
to
be
found
in
every
age
of
christ
church
to
be
losing
most
fearfully
and
rapidly
the
living
spirit
of
christianity
and
to
be
for
that
very
reason
clinging
all
the
more
convulsively
and
who
can
blame
them
to
the
outward
letter
of
it
whether
high
church
or
evangelical
unconscious
all
the
while
that
they
are
sinking
out
of
real
living
belief
into
that
dead
which
has
been
always
heretofore
and
is
becoming
in
england
now
the
parent
of
the
most
blind
dishonest
and
pitiless
bigotry
in
the
following
pages
i
have
attempted
to
show
what
some
at
least
of
the
young
in
these
days
are
really
thinking
and
feeling
i
know
well
that
my
sketch
is
inadequate
and
partial
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
from
the
criticisms
which
i
have
received
since
its
first
publication
that
it
is
as
far
as
it
goes
correct
i
put
it
as
a
problem
it
would
be
the
height
of
arrogance
in
me
to
do
more
than
indicate
the
direction
in
which
i
think
a
solution
may
be
found
i
fear
that
my
elder
readers
may
complain
that
i
have
no
right
to
start
doubts
without
answering
them
i
can
only
answer
would
that
i
had
started
them
would
that
i
was
not
seeing
them
daily
around
me
under
some
form
or
other
in
just
the
very
hearts
for
whom
one
would
most
wish
the
peace
and
strength
of
a
fixed
and
healthy
faith
to
the
young
this
book
can
do
no
harm
for
it
will
put
into
their
minds
little
but
what
is
there
already
to
the
elder
it
may
do
good
for
it
may
teach
some
of
them
as
i
earnestly
hope
something
of
the
real
but
too
often
utterly
unsuspected
state
of
their
own
children
minds
something
of
the
reasons
of
that
calamitous
estrangement
between
themselves
and
those
who
will
succeed
them
which
is
often
too
painful
and
oppressive
to
be
confessed
to
their
own
hearts
whatever
amount
of
obloquy
this
book
may
bring
upon
me
i
shall
think
that
a
light
price
to
pay
if
by
it
i
shall
have
helped
even
in
a
single
case
to
the
hearts
of
the
parents
to
the
children
and
the
hearts
of
the
children
to
the
parents
before
the
great
and
terrible
day
of
the
lord
come
as
come
it
surely
will
if
we
persist
much
longer
in
substituting
denunciation
for
sympathy
instruction
for
education
and
pharisaism
for
the
good
news
of
the
kingdom
of
god
chapter
i
the
philosophy
of
as
this
my
story
will
probably
run
counter
to
more
than
one
fashion
of
the
day
literary
and
other
it
is
prudent
to
bow
to
those
fashions
wherever
i
honestly
can
and
therefore
to
begin
with
a
scrap
of
description
the
edge
of
a
great
a
flat
wilderness
of
low
leafless
oaks
fortified
by
a
long
dreary
thorn
capped
clay
ditch
with
sour
red
water
oozing
out
at
every
yard
a
broken
gate
leading
into
a
straight
wood
ride
ragged
with
dead
grasses
and
black
with
fallen
leaves
the
centre
mashed
into
a
quagmire
by
innumerable
horsehoofs
some
forty
red
coats
and
some
four
black
a
sprinkling
of
farmers
resplendent
in
gold
buttons
and
green
a
pair
of
sleek
drab
showing
off
horses
for
sale
the
surgeon
of
the
union
in
mackintosh
and
antigropelos
two
holiday
schoolboys
with
trousers
strapped
down
to
bursting
point
like
a
penny
steamer
a
midshipman
the
only
merry
one
in
the
field
bumping
about
on
a
fretting
sweating
hack
with
its
nose
a
foot
above
its
ears
and
lancelot
smith
who
then
kept
two
good
horses
and
forward
as
a
fine
young
fellow
of
who
can
afford
it
and
nothing
else
to
do
has
a
very
good
right
to
ride
but
what
is
a
description
without
a
sketch
of
the
weather
in
these
pantheist
days
especially
when
a
hero
or
heroine
moral
state
must
entirely
depend
on
the
barometer
and
authors
talk
as
if
christians
were
cabbages
and
a
man
soul
as
well
as
his
lungs
might
be
saved
by
and
sunshine
or
his
character
developed
by
wearing
guano
in
his
shoes
and
training
himself
against
a
south
wall
we
must
have
a
weather
description
though
as
i
shall
presently
show
one
in
flat
contradiction
of
the
popular
theory
luckily
for
our
information
lancelot
was
very
much
given
to
watch
both
the
weather
and
himself
and
had
indeed
while
in
his
teens
combined
the
two
in
a
sort
of
a
on
the
principles
just
mentioned
somewhat
in
this
style
wind
bright
sun
mercury
at
inches
felt
my
heart
expanded
towards
the
universe
organs
of
veneration
and
benevolence
pleasingly
excited
and
gave
a
shilling
to
a
tramp
an
inexpressible
joy
bounded
through
every
vein
and
the
soft
air
breathed
purity
and
through
my
soul
as
i
watched
the
beetles
those
children
of
the
sun
who
as
divine
shelley
says
laden
with
light
and
odour
pass
over
the
gleam
of
the
living
grass
i
gained
an
of
the
pleasures
of
virtue
found
the
tramp
drunk
in
a
ditch
i
could
not
have
degraded
myself
on
such
a
day
ah
how
could
he
barometer
rapidly
falling
heavy
clouds
in
the
my
heart
sank
into
gloomy
forebodings
read
manfred
and
doubted
whether
i
should
live
long
the
laden
weight
of
destiny
seemed
to
crush
down
my
aching
forehead
till
the
thunderstorm
burst
and
peace
was
restored
to
my
troubled
soul
this
was
very
bad
but
to
do
justice
to
lancelot
he
had
grown
out
of
it
at
the
time
when
my
story
begins
he
was
now
in
the
fifth
act
of
his
stage
that
sentimental
measles
which
all
clever
men
must
catch
once
in
their
lives
and
which
generally
like
the
physical
measles
if
taken
early
settles
their
constitution
for
good
or
evil
if
taken
late
goes
far
towards
killing
them
lancelot
had
found
byron
and
shelley
pall
on
his
taste
and
commenced
devouring
bulwer
and
worshipping
ernest
maltravers
he
had
left
bulwer
for
old
ballads
and
romances
and
carlyle
reviews
was
next
alternately
and
was
now
reading
hard
at
physical
science
and
on
the
whole
trying
to
become
a
great
man
without
any
very
clear
notion
of
what
a
great
man
ought
to
be
real
education
he
never
had
had
bred
up
at
home
under
his
father
a
rich
merchant
he
had
gone
to
college
with
a
large
stock
of
general
information
and
a
particular
mania
for
dried
plants
fossils
butterflies
and
sketching
and
some
such
creed
as
this
that
he
was
very
clever
that
he
ought
to
make
his
fortune
that
a
great
many
things
were
very
pleasant
beautiful
things
among
the
rest
that
it
was
a
fine
thing
to
be
generous
and
courageous
that
a
man
ought
to
be
religious
and
left
college
with
a
good
smattering
of
classics
and
mathematics
picked
up
in
the
intervals
of
and
hunting
and
much
the
same
creed
as
he
brought
with
him
except
in
regard
to
the
last
article
the
mania
was
now
somewhat
at
a
discount
he
had
discovered
a
new
natural
object
including
in
itself
all
more
than
all
yet
found
beauties
and
wonders
woman
draw
draw
the
veil
and
weep
guardian
angel
if
such
there
be
what
was
to
be
expected
pleasant
things
were
pleasant
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
whatever
else
might
be
doubtful
he
had
read
byron
by
stealth
he
had
been
flogged
into
reading
ovid
and
tibullus
and
commanded
by
his
private
tutor
to
read
martial
and
juvenal
the
improvement
of
his
style
all
conversation
on
the
subject
of
love
had
been
prudishly
avoided
as
usual
by
his
parents
and
teacher
the
parts
of
the
bible
which
spoke
of
it
had
been
always
kept
out
of
his
sight
love
had
been
to
him
practically
ground
tabooed
and
what
was
to
be
expected
just
what
happened
if
woman
beauty
had
nothing
holy
in
it
why
should
his
fondness
for
it
just
what
happens
every
day
that
he
had
to
sow
his
wild
oats
for
himself
and
eat
the
fruit
thereof
and
the
dirt
thereof
also
o
fathers
fathers
and
you
clergymen
who
monopolise
education
either
tell
boys
the
truth
about
love
or
do
not
put
into
their
hands
without
note
or
comment
the
foul
devil
lies
about
it
which
make
up
the
mass
of
the
latin
poets
and
then
go
fresh
from
teaching
juvenal
and
ovid
to
declaim
at
exeter
hall
against
poor
peter
dens
prurience
had
we
not
better
take
the
beam
out
of
our
own
eye
before
we
meddle
with
the
mote
in
the
jesuit
but
where
is
my
description
of
the
weather
all
this
time
i
can
not
i
am
sorry
to
say
give
any
very
cheerful
account
of
the
weather
that
day
but
what
matter
are
englishmen
who
only
take
their
sport
when
the
sun
shines
is
it
not
on
the
contrary
symbolical
of
our
national
character
that
almost
all
our
field
amusements
are
wintry
ones
our
fowling
our
hunting
our
pastime
for
hymir
himself
and
the
frost
giants
our
golf
and
skating
our
very
cricket
and
and
jack
and
grayling
fishing
carried
on
till
we
are
fairly
frozen
out
we
are
a
stern
people
and
winter
suits
us
nature
then
retires
modestly
into
the
background
and
spares
us
the
obtrusive
glitter
of
summer
leaving
us
to
think
and
work
and
therefore
it
happens
that
in
england
it
may
be
taken
as
a
general
rule
that
whenever
all
the
rest
of
the
world
is
we
are
out
and
busy
and
on
the
whole
the
worse
the
day
the
better
the
deed
the
weather
that
day
the
first
day
lancelot
ever
saw
his
beloved
was
truly
national
a
silent
dim
distanceless
steaming
rotting
day
in
march
the
last
brown
which
had
stood
out
the
winter
frost
spun
and
quivered
plump
down
and
then
lay
as
if
ashamed
to
have
broken
for
a
moment
the
ghastly
stillness
like
an
awkward
guest
at
a
great
dumb
a
cold
suck
of
wind
just
proved
its
existence
by
toothaches
on
the
north
side
of
all
faces
the
spiders
having
been
the
night
before
had
unanimously
agreed
to
cover
every
brake
and
brier
with
cradles
and
never
a
fly
to
be
caught
in
them
like
manchester
madly
glutting
the
markets
in
the
teeth
of
demand
the
steam
crawled
out
of
the
dank
turf
and
reeked
off
the
flanks
and
nostrils
of
the
shivering
horses
and
clung
with
clammy
paws
to
frosted
hats
and
dripping
boughs
a
soulless
skyless
catarrhal
day
as
if
that
bustling
dowager
old
mother
earth
what
with
in
spring
and
fetes
champetres
in
summer
and
in
autumn
was
fairly
worn
out
and
put
to
bed
with
the
influenza
under
wet
blankets
and
the
cure
there
sat
lancelot
by
the
his
knees
aching
with
cold
and
wet
thanking
his
stars
that
he
was
not
one
of
the
who
were
lashing
about
in
the
dripping
cover
laying
up
for
themselves
in
catering
for
the
amusement
of
their
betters
a
probable
old
age
of
torture
in
the
form
of
rheumatic
gout
not
that
he
was
at
all
happy
indeed
he
had
no
reason
to
be
so
for
first
the
hounds
would
not
find
next
he
had
left
at
home
a
review
article
on
the
silurian
system
which
he
had
solemnly
promised
an
abject
and
beseeching
editor
to
send
to
post
that
night
next
he
was
on
the
windward
side
of
the
cover
and
dare
not
light
a
cigar
and
lastly
his
mucous
membrane
in
general
was
not
in
the
happiest
condition
seeing
that
he
had
been
dining
the
evening
before
with
vaurien
of
rottenpalings
a
young
gentleman
of
a
convivial
and
melodious
turn
of
mind
who
sang
and
played
also
as
singing
men
are
wont
in
more
senses
than
one
and
had
and
gentlemen
down
from
town
to
stay
with
him
and
they
sang
and
played
too
and
so
somehow
between
and
lancelot
had
not
arrived
at
home
till
seven
that
morning
and
was
in
a
fit
state
to
appreciate
the
feelings
of
our
grandfathers
when
after
the
third
bottle
of
port
they
used
to
put
the
black
silk
tights
into
their
pockets
slip
on
the
leathers
and
boots
and
ride
the
hack
thirty
miles
on
a
winter
night
to
meet
the
hounds
in
the
next
county
by
ten
in
the
morning
they
are
down
to
hades
even
many
stalwart
souls
of
heroes
with
john
warde
of
squerries
at
their
head
the
fathers
of
the
men
who
conquered
at
waterloo
and
we
their
degenerate
grandsons
are
left
instead
with
puny
arms
and
polished
leather
boots
and
a
considerable
taint
of
hereditary
disease
to
sit
in
and
celebrate
the
progress
of
the
species
whether
lancelot
or
his
horse
under
these
depressing
circumstances
fell
asleep
or
whether
thoughts
pertaining
to
such
a
life
and
its
fitness
for
a
clever
and
ardent
young
fellow
in
the
nineteenth
century
became
gradually
too
painful
and
had
to
be
peremptorily
shaken
off
this
deponent
sayeth
not
but
certainly
after
thirty
minutes
of
idleness
and
shivering
lancelot
opened
his
eyes
with
a
sudden
start
and
struck
spurs
into
his
hunter
without
due
cause
shown
whereat
who
was
no
griselda
in
temper
lancelot
had
bought
him
out
of
the
pytchley
for
half
his
value
as
unrideably
vicious
when
he
had
killed
a
groom
and
fallen
backwards
on
a
the
first
season
after
he
came
up
from
horncastle
responded
by
a
furious
kick
or
two
threw
his
head
up
put
his
foot
into
a
drain
and
sprawled
down
all
but
on
his
nose
pitching
lancelot
unawares
shamefully
on
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
a
certain
fatality
by
the
bye
had
lately
attended
all
lancelot
efforts
to
shine
he
never
bought
a
new
coat
without
tearing
it
mysteriously
next
day
or
tried
to
make
a
joke
without
bursting
out
coughing
in
the
middle
and
now
the
whole
field
were
looking
on
at
his
mishap
between
disgust
and
the
start
he
turned
almost
sick
and
felt
the
blood
rush
into
his
cheeks
and
forehead
as
he
heard
a
shout
of
coarse
jovial
laughter
burst
out
close
to
him
and
the
old
master
of
the
hounds
squire
lavington
roared
aloud
pretty
sportsman
you
are
smith
to
fall
asleep
by
the
side

down

to
a
devout
life
poor
lancelot
wishing
himself
fathoms
ashamed
of
his
book
still
more
ashamed
of
himself
for
his
shame
he
had
to
sit
there
ten
physical
seconds
or
spiritual
years
while
the
colonel
solemnly
returned
him
the
book
complimenting
him
on
the
proofs
of
its
purifying
influence
which
he
had
given
the
night
before
in
helping
to
throw
the
into
the
river
but
things
do
end
and
so
did
this
and
the
silence
of
the
hounds
also
and
a
faint
but
knowing
whimper
drove
francis
out
of
all
heads
and
lancelot
began
to
stalk
slowly
with
a
dozen
horsemen
up
the
to
a
fitful
accompaniment
of
wandering
where
the
choristers
were
as
invisible
as
nightingales
among
the
thick
cover
and
hark
just
as
the
book
was
returned
to
his
pocket
the
sweet
hubbub
suddenly
crashed
out
into
one
jubilant
shriek
and
then
swept
away
fainter
and
fainter
among
the
trees
the
walk
became
a
trot
the
trot
a
canter
then
a
faint
melancholy
shout
at
a
distance
answered
by
a
away
from
the
fields
a
doleful
of
the
horn
the
dull
thunder
of
many
horsehoofs
rolling
along
the
farther
woodside
then
red
coats
flashing
like
sparks
of
fire
across
the
gray
gap
of
mist
at
the
then
a
bringing
up
a
belated
hound
burst
into
the
pathway
smashing
and
plunging
with
shut
eyes
through
and
then
a
fat
farmer
sedulously
pounding
through
the
mud
was
overtaken
and
bespattered
in
spite
of
all
his
struggles
until
the
line
streamed
out
into
the
wide
rushy
pasture
startling
up
pewits
and
curlews
as
horsemen
poured
in
from
every
side
and
cunning
old
farmers
rode
off
at
inexplicable
angles
to
some
known
haunts
of
pug
and
right
ahead
chiming
and
jangling
sweet
madness
the
dappled
pack
glanced
and
wavered
through
the
veil
of
soft
grey
mist
the
use
of
this
hurry
growled
lancelot
will
all
be
back
again
i
never
have
the
luck
to
see
a
run
but
no
on
and
on
down
the
wind
and
down
the
vale
and
the
canter
became
a
gallop
and
the
gallop
a
long
straining
stride
and
a
hundred
horsehoofs
crackled
like
flame
among
the
stubbles
and
thundered
along
the
heavy
meadows
and
every
fence
thinned
the
cavalcade
till
the
madness
began
to
stir
all
bloods
and
with
grim
earnest
silent
faces
the
initiated
few
settled
themselves
to
their
work
and
with
the
colonel
and
lancelot
at
their
head
their
pleasure
sadly
after
the
manner
of
their
nation
as
old
froissart
has
it
bush
through
brier
thorough
park
through
pale
till
the
rolling
spread
out
into
flat
black
open
fallows
crossed
with
grassy
baulks
and
here
and
there
a
long
melancholy
line
of
tall
elms
while
before
them
the
high
chalk
ranges
gleamed
above
the
mist
like
a
vast
wall
of
emerald
enamelled
with
snow
and
the
winding
river
glittering
at
their
feet
polite
fox
observed
the
colonel
leading
the
squire
straight
home
to
whitford
just
in
time
for
dinner
they
were
in
the
last
meadow
with
the
stream
before
them
a
line
of
struggling
heads
in
the
swollen
and
milky
current
showed
the
hounds
opinion
of
reynard
course
the
sportsmen
galloped
off
towards
the
nearest
bridge
bracebridge
looked
back
at
lancelot
who
had
been
keeping
by
his
side
in
sulky
rivalry
following
him
successfully
through
all
manner
of
desperate
places
and
more
and
more
angry
with
himself
and
the
guiltless
colonel
because
he
only
followed
while
the
colonel
quicker
and
unembarrassed
wit
which
lived
wholly
in
the
present
moment
saw
long
before
lancelot
to
cut
out
his
work
in
every
field
sha
go
round
quietly
observed
the
colonel
you
fancy
i
shall
growled
lancelot
who
took
for
granted
poor
soul
that
the
words
were
meant
as
a
hit
at
himself
a
brace
of
geese
politely
observed
the
old
squire
you
find
it
out
in
rheumatic
fever
there
one
fool
makes
many
you
kill
smith
before
you
done
colonel
and
the
old
man
wheeled
away
up
the
meadow
as
bracebridge
shouted
after
him
he
make
a
fine
rider
in
time
time
lancelot
could
have
knocked
the
unsuspecting
colonel
down
for
the
word
it
just
expressed
the
contrast
which
had
fretted
him
ever
since
he
began
to
hunt
with
the
whitford
priors
hounds
the
colonel
long
practice
and
consummate
skill
in
all
he
took
in
hand
his
experience
of
all
society
from
the
prairie
indian
to
crockford
from
the
to
the
continental
courts
his
varied
and
ready
store
of
information
and
anecdote
the
harmony
and
completeness
of
the
man
his
consistency
with
his
own
small
ideal
and
his
consequent
apparent
superiority
everywhere
and
in
everything
to
the
huge
awkward
who
though
immeasurably
beyond
bracebridge
in
intellect
and
heart
was
still
in
a
state
of
convulsive
dyspepsia
formulae
and
daily
choked
diseased
throughout
with
that
morbid
consciousness
and
lust
of
praise
for
which
god
prepares
with
his
elect
a
bitter
cure
alas
poor
lancelot
an
unlicked
bear
all
his
sorrows
before
him
along
quoth
bracebridge
between
snatches
of
a
tune
his
coolness
maddening
lancelot
lavington
will
find
us
dry
clothes
a
bottle
of
port
and
a
brace
of
charming
daughters
at
the
priory
in
with
you
little
mustang
of
the
prairie
neck
or
nothing
and
in
an
instant
the
small
wiry
american
and
the
huge
bred
hunter
were
wallowing
and
staggering
in
the
yeasty
stream
till
they
floated
into
a
deep
reach
and
swam
steadily
down
to
a
low
place
in
the
bank
they
crossed
the
stream
passed
the
priory
shrubberies
leapt
the
gate
into
the
park
and
then
on
and
upward
called
by
the
unseen
ariel
music
before
up
into
the
hills
past
white
crumbling
fringed
with
feathered
juniper
and
tottering
ashes
their
floors
strewed
with
knolls
of
fallen
soil
and
vegetation
like
wooded
islets
in
a
sea
of
up
between
steep
ridges
of
tuft
crested
with
black
and
silver
beech
and
here
and
there
a
huge
yew
standing
out
alone
the
advanced
sentry
of
the
forest
with
its
luscious
fretwork
of
green
velvet
like
a
mountain
of
gothic
spires
and
pinnacles
all
glittering
and
steaming
as
the
sun
drank
up
the
the
lark
sprang
upward
into
song
and
called
merrily
to
the
sunbeams
while
the
wreaths
and
flakes
of
mist
lingered
reluctantly
about
the
hollows
and
clung
with
dewy
fingers
to
every
knoll
and
belt
of
up
into
the
labyrinthine
bosom
of
the
hills
but
who
can
describe
them
is
not
all
nature
indescribable
every
leaf
infinite
and
transcendental
how
much
more
those
mighty
downs
with
their
enormous
sheets
of
spotless
turf
where
the
dizzy
eye
loses
all
standard
of
size
and
distance
before
the
awful
simplicity
the
delicate
vastness
of
those
grand
curves
and
swells
soft
as
the
outlines
of
a
greek
venus
as
if
the
great
hertha
had
laid
herself
down
among
the
hills
to
sleep
her
titan
limbs
wrapt
in
a
thin
veil
of
silvery
green
up
into
a
vast
amphitheatre
of
sward
whose
walls
banked
out
the
narrow
sky
above
and
here
in
the
focus
of
the
huge
ring
an
object
appeared
which
stirred
strange
melancholy
in
lancelot
a
little
chapel
girded
with
a
few
yews
and
elders
and
grassy
graves
a
climbing
rose
over
the
porch
and
iron
railings
round
the
churchyard
told
of
human
care
and
from
the
graveyard
itself
burst
up
one
of
those
noble
springs
known
as
in
the
chalk
ranges
which
awakened
in
autumn
from
the
abysses
to
which
it
had
shrunk
during
the
summer
drought
was
hurrying
down
upon
its
six
months
course
a
broad
sheet
of
oily
silver
over
a
temporary
channel
of
smooth
greensward
the
hounds
had
checked
in
the
woods
behind
now
they
poured
down
the
hillside
so
close
together
you
might
have
covered
them
with
a
sheet
straight
for
the
little
chapel
a
saddened
tone
of
feeling
spread
itself
through
lancelot
heart
there
were
the
everlasting
hills
around
even
as
they
had
grown
and
grown
for
countless
ages
beneath
the
still
depths
of
the
primeval
chalk
ocean
in
the
milky
youth
of
this
great
english
land
and
here
was
he
the
insect
of
a
day
upon
them
he
felt
ashamed
and
more
ashamed
when
the
inner
voice
whispered
hunting
is
not
the
shame
thou
art
the
shame
if
thou
art
the
insect
of
a
day
it
is
thy
sin
that
thou
art
one
and
his
sadness
foolish
as
it
may
seem
grew
as
he
watched
a
brown
speck
fleet
rapidly
up
the
opposite
hill
and
heard
a
gay
halloo
burst
from
the
colonel
at
his
side
the
chase
lost
its
charm
for
him
the
moment
the
game
was
seen
then
vanished
that
mysterious
delight
of
pursuing
an
invisible
object
which
gives
to
hunting
and
fishing
their
unutterable
and
almost
spiritual
charm
which
made
shakespeare
a
nightly
poacher
davy
and
chantrey
the
patriarchs
of
by
which
the
rod
is
transfigured
into
an
enchanter
wand
potent
over
the
unseen
wonders
of
the
to
up
spirits
from
the
vasty
deep
which
will
really
if
you
do
call
for
them
at
least
if
the
conjuration
be
orthodox
and
they
there
that
spell
was
broken
by
the
sight
of
poor
wearied
pug
his
once
brush
all
draggled
and
drooping
as
he
toiled
up
the
towards
the
open
down
above
but
lancelot
sadness
reached
its
crisis
as
he
met
the
hounds
just
outside
the
churchyard
another
moment
they
had
leaped
the
rails
and
there
they
swept
round
under
the
gray
wall
leaping
and
yelling
like
berserk
fiends
among
the
frowning
tombstones
over
the
cradles
of
the
quiet
dead
lancelot
shuddered
the
thing
was
not
wrong
was
no
one
fault
but
there
was
a
ghastly
discord
in
it
peace
and
strife
time
and
eternity
the
mad
noisy
flesh
and
the
silent
immortal
spirit
the
frivolous
game
of
life
outside
show
and
the
terrible
earnest
of
its
inward
abysses
jarred
together
without
and
within
him
he
pulled
his
horse
up
violently
and
stood
as
if
rooted
to
the
place
gazing
at
he
knew
not
what
the
hounds
caught
sight
of
the
fox
burst
into
one
frantic
shriek
of
joy
and
then
a
sudden
and
ghastly
stillness
as
mute
and
breathless
they
toiled
up
the
hillside
gaining
on
their
victim
at
every
stride
the
patter
of
the
horsehoofs
and
the
rattle
of
rolling
flints
died
away
above
lancelot
looked
up
startled
at
the
silence
laughed
aloud
he
knew
not
why
and
sat
regardless
of
his
pawing
and
straining
horse
still
staring
at
the
chapel
and
the
graves
on
a
sudden
the
opened
and
a
figure
timidly
yet
loftily
stepped
out
without
observing
him
and
suddenly
turning
round
met
him
full
face
to
face
and
stood
fixed
with
surprise
as
completely
as
lancelot
himself
that
face
and
figure
and
the
spirit
which
spoke
through
them
entered
his
heart
at
once
never
again
to
leave
it
her
features
were
aquiline
and
grand
without
a
shade
of
harshness
her
eyes
shone
out
like
twain
lakes
of
still
azure
beneath
a
broad
marble
cliff
of
polished
forehead
her
rich
chestnut
hair
rippled
downward
round
the
towering
neck
with
her
perfect
masque
and
queenly
figure
and
earnest
upward
gaze
she
might
have
been
the
very
model
from
which
raphael
conceived
his
glorious
catherine
the
ideal
of
the
highest
womanly
genius
softened
into
by
girlish
devotion
she
was
simply
almost
coarsely
dressed
but
a
glance
told
him
that
she
was
a
lady
by
the
courtesy
of
man
as
well
as
by
the
will
of
god
they
gazed
one
moment
more
at
each
other
but
what
is
time
to
spirits
with
them
as
with
their
father
day
is
as
a
thousand
years
but
that
was
cut
short
the
next
instant
by
the
decided
interference
of
the
horse
who
thoroughly
disgusted
at
his
master
whole
conduct
gave
a
significant
shake
of
his
head
and
shamming
frightened
as
both
women
and
horses
will
do
when
only
cross
commenced
a
which
drove
argemone
lavington
into
the
porch
and
gave
the
bewildered
lancelot
an
excuse
for
dashing
madly
up
the
hill
after
his
companions
a
horrible
ugly
face
said
argemone
to
herself
so
clever
and
so
unhappy
blest
pity
true
mother
of
that
graceless
scamp
young
love
who
is
ashamed
of
his
real
pedigree
and
swears
to
this
day
that
he
is
the
child
of
venus
the
coxcomb
here
for
the
sake
of
the
reader
we
omit
or
rather
postpone
a
long
dissertation
on
the
famous
erototheogonic
chorus
of
aristophanes
birds
with
illustrations
taken
from
all
earth
and
heaven
from
the
vedas
and
proclus
to
jacob
boehmen
and
saint
theresa
dichotomy
of
lancelot
personality
as
the
germans
would
call
it
returned
as
he
dashed
on
his
understanding
was
trying
to
ride
while
his
spirit
was
left
behind
with
argemone
hence
loose
reins
and
a
looser
seat
he
rolled
about
like
a
tipsy
man
holding
on
in
fact
far
more
by
his
spurs
than
by
his
knees
to
the
utter
infuriation
of
who
kicked
and
snorted
over
the
down
like
one
of
mephistopheles
they
had
mounted
the
hill
the
deer
fled
before
them
in
terror
they
neared
the
park
palings
in
the
road
beyond
them
the
hounds
were
just
killing
their
fox
struggling
and
growling
in
fierce
groups
for
the
red
gobbets
of
fur
a
panting
steaming
ring
of
horses
round
them
half
a
dozen
voices
hailed
him
as
he
came
up
have
you
been
tumble
off
had
a
fall
he

alive
break
his
neck
has
broken
it
at
last
shouted
the
colonel
as
timbers
rushed
at
the
high
pales
out
of
breath
and
blind
with
rage
lancelot
saw
and
heard
nothing
till
he
was
awakened
from
his
dream
by
the
long
heave
of
the
huge
brute
shoulder
and
the
maddening
sensation
of
sweeping
through
the
air
over
the
fence
he
started
checked
the
curb
the
horse
threw
up
his
head
fulfilling
his
name
by
driving
his
knees
like
a
against
the
pales
the
bent
like
a
withe
flew
out
into
a
hundred
splinters
and
man
and
horse
rolled
over
headlong
into
the
hard
for
one
long
sickening
second
lancelot
watched
the
blue
sky
between
his
own
knees
then
a
crash
as
if
a
shell
had
burst
in
his
face
a
horrible
grind
a
sheet
of
flame
and
the
blackness
of
night
did
you
ever
feel
it
reader
when
he
awoke
he
found
himself
lying
in
bed
with
squire
lavington
sitting
by
him
there
was
real
sorrow
in
the
old
man
face
to
himself
and
a
great
joyful
oath
rolled
out
boldest
rider
of
them
all
i
would
have
lost
him
for
a
dozen
spick
and
span
colonel
bracebridges
right
squire
answered
a
laughing
voice
from
behind
the
curtain
has
a
clear
two
thousand
a
year
and
i
live
by
my
wits
chapter
ii
spring
yearnings
i
heard
a
story
the
other
day
of
our
most
earnest
and
genial
humorist
who
is
just
now
proving
himself
also
our
most
earnest
and
genial
novelist
like
your
novel
exceedingly
said
a
lady
characters
are
so
natural
all
but
the
baronet
and
he
surely
is
overdrawn
it
is
impossible
to
find
such
coarseness
in
his
rank
of
life
the
artist
laughed
that
character
said
he
almost
the
only
exact
portrait
in
the
whole
book
so
it
is
people
do
not
see
the
strange
things
which
pass
them
every
day
romance
of
real
life
is
only
one
to
the
romantic
spirit
and
then
they
set
up
for
critics
instead
of
pupils
as
if
the
artist
business
was
not
just
to
see
what
they
can
not
see
to
open
their
eyes
to
the
harmonies
and
the
discords
the
miracles
and
the
absurdities
which
seem
to
them
one
uniform
gray
fog
of
commonplaces
then
let
the
reader
believe
that
whatsoever
is
commonplace
in
my
story
is
my
own
invention
whatsoever
may
seem
extravagant
or
startling
is
most
likely
to
be
historic
fact
else
i
should
not
have
dared
to
write
it
down
finding
god
actual
dealings
here
much
too
wonderful
to
dare
to
invent
many
fresh
ones
for
myself
lancelot
who
had
had
a
severe
concussion
of
the
brain
and
a
broken
leg
kept
his
bed
for
a
few
weeks
and
his
room
for
a
few
more
colonel
bracebridge
installed
himself
at
the
priory
and
nursed
him
with
indefatigable
and
few
thanks
he
brought
lancelot
his
breakfast
before
hunting
described
the
run
to
him
when
he
returned
read
him
to
sleep
told
him
stories
of
grizzly
bear
and
made
him
laugh
in
spite
of
himself
at
extempore
comic
medleys
kept
his
tables
covered
with
flowers
from
the
conservatory
warmed
his
chocolate
and
even
his
bed
nothing
came
amiss
to
him
and
he
to
nothing
lancelot
longed
at
first
every
hour
to
be
rid
of
him
and
eyed
him
about
the
room
as
a
bulldog
does
the
monkey
who
rides
him
in
his
dreams
he
was
sinbad
the
sailor
and
bracebridge
the
old
man
of
the
sea
but
he
could
not
hold
out
against
the
colonel
merry
bustling
kindliness
and
the
almost
womanish
tenderness
of
his
nursing
the
ice
thawed
rapidly
and
one
evening
it
split
up
altogether
when
bracebridge
who
was
sitting
drawing
by
lancelot
sofa
instead
of
amusing
himself
with
the
ladies
below
suddenly
threw
his
pencil
into
the
fire
and
broke
out
a
propos
de
rien
a
strange
pair
we
are
smith
i
think
you
just
the
best
fellow
i
ever
met
and
you
hate
me
like
poison
you
ca
deny
it
there
was
something
in
the
colonel
tone
so
utterly
different
from
his
usual
courtly
and
measured
speech
that
lancelot
was
taken
completely
by
surprise
and
stammered
out
i
i
no
no
i
know
i
am
very
foolish
ungrateful
but
i
do
hate
you
he
said
with
a
sudden
impulse
i
tell
you
why
me
your
hand
quoth
the
colonel
like
that
now
we
shall
see
our
way
with
each
other
at
least
said
lancelot
slowly
you
are
cleverer
than
i
readier
than
i
superior
to
me
in
every
point
the
colonel
laughed
not
quite
merrily
lancelot
went
on
holding
down
his
shaggy
brows
am
a
brute
and
an
ass
and
yet
i
do
not
like
to
tell
you
so
for
if
i
am
an
ass
what
are
you
i
am
wasting
my
time
and
brains
on
ribaldry
but
i
am
worth
nothing
better
at
least
i
think
so
at
times
but
you
who
can
do
anything
you
put
your
hand
to
what
business
have
you
in
the
devil
name
to
be
throwing
yourself
away
on
gimcracks
and
hunting
foolery
heavens
if
i
had
your
talents
i
be
i
make
a
name
for
myself
before
i
died
if
i
died
to
make
it
the
colonel
griped
his
hand
hard
rose
and
looked
out
of
the
window
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
dead
brooding
silence
till
he
turned
to
lancelot
smith
i
thank
you
for
your
honesty
but
good
advice
may
come
too
late
i
am
no
saint
and
god
only
knows
how
much
less
of
one
i
may
become
but
mark
my
words
if
you
are
ever
tempted
by
passion
and
vanity
and
fine
ladies
to
form
liaisons
as
the
jezebels
call
them
snares
and
nets
and
labyrinths
of
blind
ditches
to
keep
you
down
through
life
stumbling
and
grovelling
hating
yourself
and
hating
the
chain
to
which
you
cling
in
that
hour
pray
pray
as
if
the
devil
had
you
by
the
throat
to
almighty
god
to
help
you
out
of
that
cursed
slough
there
is
nothing
else
for
it
pray
i
tell
you
there
was
a
terrible
earnestness
about
the
guardsman
face
which
could
not
be
mistaken
lancelot
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
dropped
his
eyes
ashamed
as
if
he
had
intruded
on
the
speaker
confidence
by
witnessing
his
emotion
in
a
moment
the
colonel
had
returned
to
his
smile
and
his
polish
now
my
dear
invalid
i
must
beg
your
pardon
for
sermonising
what
do
you
say
to
a
game
of
ecarte
we
must
play
for
love
or
we
shall
excite
ourselves
and
scandalise
lavington
piety
and
the
colonel
pulled
a
pack
of
cards
out
of
his
pocket
and
seeing
that
lancelot
was
too
thoughtful
for
play
commenced
all
manner
of
juggler
tricks
and
chuckled
over
them
like
any
schoolboy
man
thought
lancelot
have
the
strength
of
will
which
can
thrust
its
thoughts
away
once
and
for
all
no
lancelot
more
happy
are
they
whom
god
will
not
allow
to
thrust
their
thoughts
from
them
till
the
bitter
draught
has
done
its
work
from
that
day
however
there
was
a
cordial
understanding
between
the
two
they
never
alluded
to
the
subject
but
they
had
known
the
bottom
of
each
other
heart
lancelot
was
now
pleasant
enough
and
he
drank
in
daily
his
new
friend
perpetual
stream
of
anecdote
till
march
and
hunting
were
past
and
april
was
half
over
the
old
squire
came
up
after
dinner
regularly
during
march
he
had
hunted
every
day
and
slept
every
evening
and
the
trio
chatted
along
merrily
enough
by
the
help
of
whist
and
backgammon
upon
the
surface
of
this
little
island
of
life
which
is
like
sinbad
after
all
only
the
back
of
a
floating
whale
ready
to
dive
at
any
and
then
but
what
was
argemone
doing
all
this
time
argemone
was
busy
in
her
boudoir
too
often
a
true
boudoir
to
her
among
books
and
statuettes
and
dried
flowers
fancying
herself
and
not
unfairly
very
intellectual
she
had
four
new
manias
every
year
her
last
winter
one
had
been
that
mania
miscalled
chemistry
her
spring
madness
was
for
the
greek
drama
she
had
devoured
schlegel
lectures
and
thought
them
divine
and
now
she
was
hard
at
work
on
sophocles
with
a
little
help
from
translations
and
thought
she
understood
him
every
word
then
she
was
somewhat
in
her
notions
and
used
to
go
up
every
wednesday
and
friday
to
the
chapel
in
the
hills
where
lancelot
had
met
her
for
an
hour
mystic
devotion
set
off
by
a
little
graceful
asceticism
as
for
lancelot
she
never
thought
of
him
but
as
an
who
had
met
with
his
deserts
and
the
brilliant
accounts
which
the
all
smoothing
colonel
gave
at
dinner
of
lancelot
physical
well
doing
and
agreeable
conversation
only
made
her
set
him
down
the
sooner
as
a
twin
to
the
despised
bracebridge
whom
she
hated
for
keeping
her
father
in
a
roar
of
laughter
but
her
sister
little
honoria
had
all
the
while
been
busy
messing
and
cooking
with
her
own
hands
for
the
invalid
and
almost
fell
in
love
with
the
colonel
for
his
watchful
kindness
and
here
a
word
about
honoria
to
whom
nature
according
to
her
wont
with
sisters
had
given
almost
everything
which
argemone
wanted
and
denied
almost
everything
which
argemone
had
except
beauty
and
even
in
that
the
mother
had
made
her
a
perfect
contrast
to
her
sister
tiny
and
luscious
and
as
full
of
wild
simple
passion
as
an
italian
thinking
little
except
where
she
felt
much
which
was
indeed
everywhere
for
she
lived
in
a
perpetual
shower
of
exaggerated
sympathy
for
all
suffering
whether
in
novels
or
in
life
and
daily
gave
the
lie
to
that
shallow
old
calumny
that
sorrows
harden
the
heart
to
real
ones
argemone
was
almost
angry
with
her
sometimes
when
she
trotted
whole
days
about
the
village
from
school
to
perhaps
conscience
hinted
to
her
that
her
duty
too
lay
rather
there
than
among
her
luxurious
but
alas
though
she
would
have
indignantly
repelled
the
accusation
of
selfishness
yet
in
self
and
for
self
alone
she
lived
and
while
she
had
force
of
will
for
any
and
would
fast
herself
cross
and
stupefied
and
quite
enjoy
kneeling
thinly
clad
and
barefoot
on
the
freezing
on
a
winter
morning
yet
her
fastidious
delicacy
revolted
at
sitting
like
honoria
beside
the
bed
of
the
ploughman
consumptive
daughter
in
a
reeking
stifling
garret
in
which
had
slept
the
night
before
the
father
mother
and
two
boys
not
to
mention
a
couple
the
sick
girl
and
alas
her
baby
and
of
such
bedchambers
there
were
too
many
in
whitford
priors
the
first
evening
that
lancelot
came
downstairs
honoria
clapped
her
hands
outright
for
joy
as
he
entered
and
ran
up
and
down
for
ten
minutes
fetching
and
carrying
endless
unnecessary
cushions
and
footstools
while
argemone
greeted
him
with
a
cold
distant
bow
and
a
drawl
of
carefully
commonplace
congratulations
her
heart
smote
her
though
as
she
saw
the
wan
face
and
the
wild
melancholy
moonstruck
eyes
once
more
glaring
through
and
through
her
she
found
a
comfort
in
thinking
his
stare
impertinent
drew
herself
up
and
turned
away
once
indeed
she
could
not
help
listening
as
lancelot
thanked
lavington
for
all
the
pious
and
edifying
books
with
which
the
good
lady
had
kept
his
room
rather
than
his
brain
furnished
for
the
last
six
weeks
he
was
going
to
say
more
but
he
saw
the
colonel
quaint
foxy
eye
peering
at
him
remembered
francis
de
sales
and
held
his
tongue
but
as
her
destiny
was
argemone
found
herself
in
the
course
of
the
evening
alone
with
lancelot
at
the
open
window
it
was
a
still
hot
heavy
night
after
long
easterly
drought
lightning
glimmered
on
the
far
horizon
over
the
dark
woodlands
the
coming
shower
had
sent
forward
as
his
herald
a
whispering
draught
of
fragrant
air
a
delicious
shiver
is
creeping
over
those
limes
said
lancelot
half
to
himself
the
expression
struck
argemone
it
was
the
right
one
and
it
seemed
to
open
vistas
of
feeling
and
observation
in
the
speaker
which
she
had
not
suspected
there
was
a
rich
melancholy
in
the
voice
she
turned
to
look
at
him
he
went
on
the
same
heat
which
crisps
those
thirsty
leaves
must
breed
the
which
cools
them
but
so
it
is
throughout
the
universe
every
yearning
proves
the
existence
of
an
object
meant
to
satisfy
it
the
same
law
creates
both
the
giver
and
the
receiver
the
longing
and
its
home
one
could
but
know
sometimes
what
it
is
for
which
one
is
longing
said
argemone
without
knowing
that
she
was
speaking
from
her
inmost
heart
but
thus
does
the
soul
involuntarily
lay
bare
its
most
unspoken
depths
in
the
presence
of
its
yet
unknown
mate
and
then
shudders
at
its
own
abandon
as
it
first
tries
on
the
wedding
garment
of
paradise
lancelot
was
not
yet
past
the
era
at
which
young
geniuses
are
apt
to
book
at
little
what
he
answered
flashing
up
according
to
his
fashion
be
to
be
great
to
have
done
one
mighty
work
before
we
die
and
live
unloved
or
loved
upon
the
lips
of
men
for
this
all
long
who
are
not
mere
apes
and
longed
the
founders
of
babel
answered
argemone
carelessly
to
this
tirade
she
had
risen
a
strange
fish
the
cunning
beauty
and
now
she
was
trying
her
fancy
flies
over
him
one
by
one
were
they
so
far
wrong
answered
he
the
babel
society
sprung
our
architecture
our
astronomy
politics
and
colonisation
no
doubt
the
old
hebrew
sheiks
thought
them
impious
enough
for
daring
to
build
brick
walls
instead
of
keeping
to
the
good
fashioned
tents
and
gathering
themselves
into
a
nation
instead
of
remaining
a
mere
family
horde
and
gave
their
own
account
of
the
myth
just
as
the
antediluvian
savages
gave
theirs
of
that
strange
eden
scene
by
the
common
interpretation
of
which
the
devil
is
made
the
first
inventor
of
modesty
men
are
all
conservatives
everything
new
is
impious
till
we
get
accustomed
to
it
and
if
it
fails
the
mob
piously
discover
a
divine
vengeance
in
the
mischance
from
babel
to
catholic
emancipation
lancelot
had
stuttered
horribly
during
the
latter
part
of
this
most
heterodox
outburst
for
he
had
begun
to
think
about
himself
and
try
to
say
a
fine
thing
suspecting
all
the
while
that
it
might
not
be
true
but
argemone
did
not
remark
the
stammering
the
new
thoughts
startled
and
pained
her
but
there
was
a
daring
grace
about
them
she
tried
as
women
will
to
answer
him
with
arguments
and
failed
as
women
will
fail
she
was
accustomed
to
lay
down
the
law
a
la
madame
de
stael
to
savants
and
and
be
heard
with
reverence
as
a
woman
should
be
but
poor
lancelot
did
not
see
what
sex
had
to
do
with
logic
he
flew
at
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
very
barrister
and
hunted
her
mercilessly
up
and
down
through
all
sorts
of
charming
sophisms
as
she
begged
the
question
and
shifted
her
ground
as
thoroughly
right
in
her
conclusion
as
she
was
wrong
in
her
reasoning
till
she
grew
quite
confused
and
and
then
lancelot
suddenly
shrank
into
his
shell
claws
and
all
like
an
affrighted
hung
down
his
head
and
stammered
out
some
incoherencies
accustomed
to
talk
to
women
ladies
i
mean
pray
forgive
me
and
he
looked
up
and
her
eyes
met
his
and
she
saw
that
they
were
filled
with
tears
have
i
to
forgive
she
said
more
gently
wondering
on
what
sort
of
strange
sportsman
she
had
fallen
treat
me
like
an
equal
you
will
deign
to
argue
with
me
but
men
in
general
oh
they
hide
their
contempt
for
us
if
not
their
own
ignorance
under
that
mask
of
chivalrous
deference
and
then
in
the
nasal
fine
ladies
key
which
was
her
shell
as
bitter
brusquerie
was
his
she
added
with
an
amazon
queen
toss
of
the
head
must
come
and
see
us
often
we
shall
suit
each
other
i
see
better
than
most
whom
we
see
here
a
sneer
and
a
blush
passed
together
over
lancelot
ugliness
better
than
the
glib
colonel
bracebridge
yonder
he
is
witty
enough
but
he
lives
on
the
surface
of
everything
he
is
altogether
shallow
and
blase
his
is
the
fruit
of
want
of
feeling
between
his
gracefulness
and
his
sneering
persiflage
he
is
a
perfect
what
a
snare
a
nickname
is
out
it
must
come
though
it
carry
a
lie
on
its
back
but
the
truth
was
argemone
thought
herself
infinitely
superior
to
the
colonel
for
which
simple
reason
she
could
not
in
the
least
understand
him
by
the
bye
how
subtly
tennyson
has
embodied
all
this
in
the
princess
how
he
shows
us
the
woman
when
she
takes
her
stand
on
the
false
masculine
ground
of
intellect
working
out
her
own
moral
punishment
by
destroying
in
herself
the
tender
heart
of
flesh
which
is
either
woman
highest
blessing
or
her
bitterest
curse
how
she
loses
all
feminine
sensibility
to
the
of
feeling
in
us
poor
men
and
falls
from
pride
to
sternness
from
sternness
to
sheer
inhumanity
i
should
have
honoured
myself
by
pleading
guilty
to
stealing
much
of
argemone
character
from
the
princess
had
not
the
idea
been
conceived
and
fairly
worked
out
long
before
the
appearance
of
that
noble
poem
they
said
no
more
to
each
other
that
evening
argemone
was
called
to
the
piano
and
lancelot
took
up
the
sporting
magazine
and
read
himself
to
sleep
till
the
party
separated
for
the
night
argemone
went
up
thoughtfully
to
her
own
room
the
shower
had
fallen
and
the
moon
was
shining
bright
while
every
budding
leaf
and
knot
of
mould
steamed
up
cool
perfume
borrowed
from
the
treasures
of
the
thundercloud
all
around
was
working
the
infinite
mystery
of
birth
and
growth
of
giving
and
taking
of
beauty
and
use
all
things
were
harmonious
all
things
reciprocal
without
argemone
felt
herself
needless
lonely
and
out
of
tune
with
herself
and
nature
she
sat
in
the
window
and
listlessly
read
over
to
herself
a
fragment
of
her
own
poetry
sappho
she
lay
among
the
myrtles
on
the
cliff
above
her
glared
the
moon
beneath
the
sea
upon
the
white
horizon
athos
peak
weltered
in
burning
haze
all
airs
were
dead
the
sicale
slept
among
the
tamarisk
hair
the
birds
sat
dumb
and
drooping
far
below
the
lazy
glistened
in
the
sun
the
lazy
dried
their
steaming
wings
the
lazy
swell
crept
whispering
up
the
ledge
and
sank
again
great
pan
was
laid
to
rest
and
mother
earth
watched
by
him
as
he
slept
and
hushed
her
myriad
children
for
awhile
she
lay
among
the
myrtles
on
the
cliff
and
sighed
for
sleep
for
sleep
that
would
not
hear
but
left
her
tossing
still
for
night
and
day
a
mighty
hunger
yearned
within
her
heart
till
all
her
veins
ran
fever
and
her
cheek
her
long
thin
hands
and
feet
were
wasted
with
the
wasting
of
her
soul
then
peevishly
she
flung
her
on
her
face
and
hid
her
eyeballs
from
the
blinding
glare
and
fingered
at
the
grass
and
tried
to
cool
her
crisp
hot
lips
against
the
crisp
hot
sward
and
then
she
raised
her
head
and
upward
cast
wild
looks
from
homeless
eyes
whose
liquid
light
gleamed
out
between
deep
folds
of
hair
as
gleam
twin
lakes
between
the
purple
peaks
of
deep
parnassus
at
the
mournful
moon
beside
her
lay
a
lyre
she
snatched
the
shell
and
waked
wild
music
from
its
silver
strings
then
tossed
it
sadly
by
hush
she
cries
offspring
of
the
tortoise
and
the
mine
why
mock
my
discords
with
thine
harmonies
a
lot
be
thine
only
to
echo
back
in
every
tone
the
moods
of
nobler
natures
than
thine
own
she
said
soft
and
rounded
rhyme
suits
ill
with
sappho
fitful
and
wayward
agonies
she
should
burst
out
at
once
into
wild
passionate
and
disgust
at
that
universe
with
whose
beauty
she
has
filled
her
eyes
in
vain
to
find
it
always
a
dead
picture
unsatisfying
unloving
as
i
have
found
it
sweet
had
you
no
other
reason
for
choosing
as
your
heroine
sappho
the
victim
of
the
idolatry
of
intellect
trying
in
vain
to
fill
her
heart
with
the
friendship
of
her
own
sex
and
then
sinking
into
mere
passion
for
a
handsome
boy
and
so
down
into
contempt
and
suicide
she
was
conscious
i
do
believe
of
no
other
reason
than
that
she
gave
but
consciousness
is
a
dim
candle
over
a
deep
mine
all
she
said
pettishly
will
call
it
a
mere
imitation
of
shelley
alastor
and
what
harm
if
it
is
is
there
to
be
no
female
alastor
has
not
the
woman
as
good
a
right
as
the
man
to
long
after
ideal
beauty
to
pine
and
die
if
she
can
not
find
it
and
regenerate
herself
in
its
light
youp
youp
arose
doleful
through
the
echoing
shrubbery
argemone
started
and
looked
out
it
was
not
a
banshee
but
a
forgotten
puppy
sitting
mournfully
on
the
beneath
staring
at
the
clear
ghastly
moon
she
laughed
and
blushed
there
was
a
rebuke
in
it
she
turned
to
go
to
rest
and
as
she
knelt
and
prayed
at
her
velvet
faldstool
among
all
the
nicknacks
which
make
a
luxury
of
devotion
was
it
strange
if
after
she
had
prayed
for
the
fate
of
nations
and
churches
and
for
those
who
as
she
thought
were
fighting
at
oxford
the
cause
of
universal
truth
and
reverend
antiquity
she
remembered
in
her
petitions
the
poor
godless
youth
with
his
troubled
and
troubling
eloquence
but
it
was
strange
that
she
blushed
when
she
mentioned
his
name
why
should
she
not
pray
for
him
as
she
prayed
for
others
perhaps
she
felt
that
she
did
not
pray
for
him
as
she
prayed
for
others
she
left
the
aeolian
harp
in
the
window
as
a
luxury
if
she
should
wake
and
coiled
herself
up
among
lace
pillows
and
eider
blemos
and
the
hound
coiled
himself
up
on
the
after
a
solemn
of
three
turns
round
in
his
own
length
looking
vainly
for
a
stone
the
finest
of
us
are
animals
after
all
and
live
by
eating
and
sleeping
and
taken
as
animals
not
so
badly
off
either
unless
we
happen
to
be
dorsetshire
labourers
or
spitalfields
weavers
or
colliery
children
or
marching
soldiers
or
i
am
afraid
one
half
of
english
souls
this
day
and
argemone
dreamed
that
she
was
a
fox
flying
for
her
life
through
a
churchyard
and
lancelot
was
a
hound
yelling
and
leaping
in
a
red
coat
and
white
buckskins
close
upon
her
and
she
felt
his
hot
breath
and
saw
his
white
teeth
and
then
her
father
was
there
and
he
was
an
italian
boy
and
played
the
organ
and
lancelot
was
a
dancing
dog
and
stood
up
and
danced
to
the
tune
of
pitifully
enough
in
his
red
coat
and
she
stood
up
and
danced
too
but
she
found
her
dress
insufficient
and
begged
hard
for
a
paper
frill
which
was
denied
her
whereat
she
cried
bitterly
and
woke
and
saw
the
night
peeping
in
with
her
bright
diamond
eyes
and
blushed
and
hid
her
beautiful
face
in
the
pillows
and
fell
asleep
again
what
the
little
imp
who
managed
this
on
argemone
may
have
intended
to
symbolise
thereby
and
whence
he
stole
his
actors
and
and
whether
he
got
up
the
interlude
for
his
own
private
fun
or
for
that
of
a
choir
of
brother
eulenspiegels
or
finally
for
the
edification
of
argemone
as
to
her
own
history
past
present
or
future
are
questions
which
we
must
leave
unanswered
till
physicians
have
become
a
little
more
of
metaphysicians
and
have
given
up
their
present
plan
of
ignoring
for
nine
hundred
and
pages
that
most
awful
and
significant
custom
of
dreaming
and
then
in
the
thousandth
page
talking
the
boldest
materialist
twaddle
about
it
in
the
meantime
lancelot
contrary
to
the
colonel
express
commands
was
sitting
up
to
indite
the
following
letter
to
his
cousin
the
tractarian
curate
complain
that
i
waste
my
time
in
how
do
you
know
that
i
waste
my
time
i
find
within
myself
certain
appetites
and
i
suppose
that
the
god
whom
you
say
made
me
made
those
appetites
as
a
part
of
me
why
are
they
to
be
crushed
any
more
than
any
other
part
of
me
i
am
the
whole
of
what
i
find
in
myself
am
i
to
pick
and
choose
myself
out
of
myself
and
besides
i
feel
that
the
exercise
of
freedom
activity
foresight
daring
independent
determination
even
in
a
few
minutes
burst
across
country
strengthens
me
in
mind
as
well
as
in
body
it
might
not
do
so
to
you
but
you
are
of
a
different
constitution
and
from
all
i
see
the
power
of
a
man
muscles
the
excitability
of
his
nerves
the
shape
and
balance
of
his
brain
make
him
what
he
is
else
what
is
the
meaning
of
physiognomy
every
man
destiny
as
the
turks
say
stands
written
on
his
forehead
one
does
not
need
two
glances
at
your
face
to
know
that
you
would
not
enjoy
that
you
would
enjoy
and
refined
repose
as
they
are
pleased
to
call
it
every
man
carries
his
character
in
his
brain
you
all
know
that
and
act
upon
it
when
you
have
to
deal
with
a
man
for
sixpence
but
your
religious
dogmas
which
make
out
that
everyman
comes
into
the
world
equally
brutish
and
fiendish
make
you
afraid
to
confess
it
i
do
quarrel
with
a
douce
man
like
you
with
a
large
organ
of
veneration
for
following
your
bent
but
if
i
am
fiery
with
a
huge
cerebellum
why
am
i
not
to
follow
mine
for
that
is
what
you
do
after
all
what
you
like
best
it
is
all
very
easy
for
a
man
to
talk
of
conquering
his
appetites
when
he
has
none
to
conquer
try
and
conquer
your
organ
of
veneration
or
of
benevolence
or
of
calculation
then
i
will
call
you
an
ascetic
why
not
the
same
power
which
made
the
front
of
one
head
made
the
back
i
suppose
i
tell
you
hunting
does
me
good
it
awakens
me
out
of
my
dreary
of
metaphysics
it
sweeps
away
that
infernal
web
of
and
absorbs
me
in
outward
objects
and
my
perillus
bull
cools
in
proportion
as
my
horse
warms
i
tell
you
i
never
saw
a
man
who
could
cut
out
his
way
across
country
who
could
not
cut
his
way
through
better
things
when
his
turn
came
the
cleverest
and
noblest
fellows
are
sure
to
be
the
best
riders
in
the
long
run
and
as
for
bad
company
and
the
world
when
you
take
to
going
in
the
carriages
for
fear
of
meeting
a
swearing
sailor
in
the
when
those
who
have
renounced
the
world
give
up
buying
and
selling
in
the
funds
when
my
uncle
the
pious
banker
who
will
only
associate
with
the
truly
religious
gives
up
dealing
with
any
scoundrel
or
heathen
who
can
do
business
with
him
then
you
may
quote
pious
people
opinions
to
me
in
god
name
if
the
stock
exchange
and
railway
stagging
and
the
advertisements
in
the
protestant
and
the
frantic
which
has
been
for
the
last
fifty
years
the
peculiar
pursuit
of
the
majority
of
quakers
dissenters
and
religious
churchmen
are
not
the
world
what
is
i
do
complain
of
them
though
puritanism
has
interdicted
to
them
all
art
all
excitement
all
amusement
except
it
is
their
dernier
ressort
poor
souls
you
must
explain
to
us
naughty
how
all
this
agrees
with
the
good
book
we
see
plainly
enough
in
the
meantime
how
it
agrees
with
poor
human
nature
we
see
that
the
religious
world
like
the
great
world
and
the
sporting
world
and
the
literary
world
compounds
for
sins
she
is
inclined
to
by
damning
those
she
has
no
mind
to
and
that
because
england
is
a
country
and
is
an
effeminate
pursuit
therefore
all
sedentary
and
spoony
sins
like
covetousness
slander
bigotry
and
are
to
be
cockered
and
plastered
over
while
the
more
masculine
vices
and
vices
also
are
mercilessly
hunted
down
by
your
handed
religionists
is
a
more
quiet
letter
than
usual
from
me
my
dear
coz
for
many
of
your
reproofs
cut
me
home
they
angered
me
at
the
time
but
i
deserve
them
i
am
miserable
craving
for
freedom
and
yet
crying
aloud
for
some
one
to
come
and
guide
me
and
teach
me
and
who
is
there
in
these
days
who
could
teach
a
fast
man
even
if
he
would
try
be
sure
that
as
long
as
you
and
yours
make
piety
a
synonym
for
unmanliness
you
will
never
convert
either
me
or
any
other
good
sportsman
the
bye
my
dear
fellow
was
i
asleep
or
awake
when
i
seemed
to
read
in
the
postscript
of
your
last
letter
something
about
being
driven
to
rome
after
all
why
thither
of
all
places
in
heaven
or
earth
you
know
i
have
no
party
interest
in
the
question
all
creeds
are
very
much
alike
to
me
just
now
but
allow
me
to
ask
in
a
spirit
of
the
most
tolerant
curiosity
what
possible
celestial
bait
either
of
the
useful
or
the
agreeable
kind
can
the
present
excellent
pope
or
his
adherents
hold
out
to
you
in
compensation
for
the
solid
earthly
pudding
which
you
would
have
to
desert
i
daresay
though
that
i
shall
not
comprehend
your
answer
when
it
comes
i
am
you
know
utterly
deficient
in
that
sixth
sense
of
the
angelic
or
supralunar
beautiful
which
fills
your
soul
with
ecstasy
you
i
know
expect
and
long
to
become
an
angel
after
death
i
am
under
the
strange
hallucination
that
my
body
is
part
of
me
and
in
spite
of
old
plotinus
look
with
horror
at
a
disembodiment
till
the
giving
of
that
new
body
the
great
perfection
of
which
in
your
eyes
and
those
of
every
one
else
seems
to
be
that
it
will
be
less
and
not
more
of
a
body
than
our
present
is
this
hope
to
me
at
once
inconceivable
and
contradictory
palpable
and
valuable
enough
to
you
to
send
you
to
that
italian
avernus
to
get
it
made
a
little
more
certain
if
so
i
despair
of
your
making
your
meaning
intelligible
to
a
poor
fellow
wallowing
like
me
in
the
hylic
borboros
or
whatever
else
you
may
choose
to
call
the
unfortunate
fact
of
being
flesh
and
still
write
chapter
iii
new
actors
and
a
new
stage
when
argemone
rose
in
the
morning
her
first
thought
was
of
lancelot
his
face
haunted
her
the
wild
brilliance
of
his
intellect
struggling
through
foul
had
haunted
her
still
more
she
had
heard
of
his
profligacy
his
bursts
of
fierce
and
yet
now
these
very
faults
instead
of
repelling
seemed
to
attract
her
and
intensify
her
longing
to
save
him
she
would
convert
him
purify
him
harmonise
his
discords
and
that
very
wish
gave
her
a
peace
she
had
never
felt
before
she
had
formed
her
idea
she
had
now
a
purpose
for
which
to
live
and
she
determined
to
concentrate
herself
for
the
work
and
longed
for
the
moment
when
she
should
meet
lancelot
and
begin
how
she
did
not
very
clearly
see
it
is
an
old
jest
the
fair
devotee
trying
to
convert
the
young
rake
men
of
the
world
laugh
heartily
at
it
and
so
does
the
devil
no
doubt
if
any
readers
wish
to
be
with
that
personage
they
may
but
as
sure
as
old
saxon
remains
for
ever
a
blessed
and
healing
law
of
life
the
devotee
may
yet
convert
the
rake
and
perhaps
herself
into
the
bargain
argemone
looked
almost
angrily
round
at
her
beloved
books
and
drawings
for
they
spoke
a
message
to
her
which
they
had
never
spoken
before
of
ambition
she
said
aloud
to
herself
have
been
selfish
utterly
art
poetry
science
i
believe
after
all
that
i
have
only
loved
them
for
my
own
sake
not
for
theirs
because
they
would
make
me
something
feed
my
conceit
of
my
own
talents
how
infinitely
more
glorious
to
find
my
and
my
prize
not
in
dead
forms
and
colours
or
theories
but
in
a
living
immortal
human
spirit
i
will
study
no
more
except
the
human
heart
and
only
that
to
purify
and
ennoble
it
true
argemone
and
yet
like
all
resolutions
somewhat
less
than
the
truth
that
morning
indeed
her
purpose
was
simple
as
god
own
light
she
never
dreamed
of
exciting
lancelot
admiration
even
his
friendship
for
herself
she
would
have
started
as
from
a
snake
from
the
issue
which
the
reader
very
clearly
foresees
that
lancelot
would
fall
in
love
not
with
young
englandism
but
with
argemone
lavington
but
yet
self
is
not
eradicated
even
from
a
woman
heart
in
one
morning
before
breakfast
besides
it
is
not
but
love
the
real
cupid
of
flesh
and
blood
who
can
first
the
chord
of
self
which
trembling
passes
in
music
out
of
sight
but
a
time
for
all
things
and
it
is
now
time
for
argemone
to
go
down
to
breakfast
having
prepared
some
dozen
imaginary
dialogues
between
herself
and
lancelot
in
which
of
course
her
eloquence
always
had
the
victory
she
had
yet
to
learn
that
it
is
better
sometimes
not
to
settle
in
one
heart
what
we
shall
speak
for
the
everlasting
will
has
good
works
ready
prepared
for
us
to
walk
in
by
what
we
call
fortunate
accident
and
it
shall
be
given
us
in
that
day
and
that
hour
what
we
shall
speak
lancelot
in
the
meantime
shrank
from
meeting
argemone
and
was
quite
glad
of
the
weakness
which
kept
him
upstairs
whether
he
was
afraid
of
her
whether
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
or
of
his
crutches
i
can
not
tell
but
i
daresay
reader
you
are
getting
tired
of
all
this
so
we
will
have
a
bit
of
action
again
for
the
sake
of
variety
if
for
nothing
better
of
all
the
species
of
lovely
scenery
which
england
holds
none
perhaps
is
more
exquisite
than
the
banks
of
the
the
perfect
limpidity
of
the
water
the
gay
and
luxuriant
vegetation
of
the
banks
and
ditches
the
masses
of
noble
wood
embosoming
the
villages
the
unique
beauty
of
the
living
sheets
of
emerald
and
silver
tinkling
and
sparkling
cool
under
the
fiercest
sun
brilliant
under
the
blackest
there
if
anywhere
one
would
have
expected
to
find
arcadia
among
fertility
loveliness
industry
and
wealth
but
alas
for
the
sad
reality
the
cool
breath
of
those
glittering
too
often
floats
laden
with
poisonous
miasma
those
picturesque
villages
are
generally
the
perennial
hotbeds
of
fever
and
ague
of
squalid
penury
sottish
profligacy
dull
discontent
too
stale
for
words
there
is
luxury
in
the
park
wealth
in
the
huge
knowledge
in
the
parsonage
but
the
poor
those
by
whose
dull
labour
all
that
luxury
and
wealth
ay
even
that
knowledge
is
made
possible
what
are
they
we
shall
see
please
god
ere
the
story
end
but
of
all
this
lancelot
as
yet
thought
nothing
he
too
had
to
be
emancipated
as
much
as
argemone
from
selfish
dreams
to
learn
to
work
trustfully
in
the
living
present
not
to
gloat
sentimentally
over
the
unreturning
past
but
his
time
was
not
yet
come
and
little
he
thought
of
all
the
work
which
lay
ready
for
him
within
a
mile
of
the
priory
as
he
watched
the
ladies
go
out
for
the
afternoon
and
slipped
down
to
the
on
his
crutches
to
smoke
and
fish
and
build
castles
in
the
air
the
priory
with
its
rambling
courts
and
gardens
stood
on
an
island
in
the
river
the
upper
stream
flowed
in
a
straight
artificial
channel
through
the
garden
still
and
broad
towards
the
priory
mill
while
just
above
the
priory
wall
half
the
river
fell
over
a
high
weir
with
all
its
appendages
of
bucks
and
hatchways
and
baskets
into
the
and
then
swept
round
under
the
ivied
walls
with
their
fantastic
turrets
and
gables
and
little
loopholed
windows
peering
out
over
the
stream
as
it
hurried
down
over
the
shallows
to
join
the
race
below
the
mill
a
postern
door
in
the
walls
opened
on
an
ornamental
wooden
bridge
across
the
a
favourite
haunt
of
all
fishers
and
sketchers
who
were
admitted
to
the
elysium
of
whitford
priors
thither
lancelot
went
congratulating
himself
strange
to
say
in
having
escaped
the
only
human
being
whom
he
loved
on
earth
he
found
on
the
two
of
the
keepers
the
younger
one
tregarva
was
a
stately
cornishman
some
six
feet
three
in
height
with
thews
and
sinews
in
proportion
he
was
sitting
on
the
bridge
looking
over
a
basket
of
and
listening
silently
to
the
chat
of
his
companion
old
harry
verney
the
other
keeper
was
a
character
in
his
way
and
a
very
bad
character
too
though
he
was
a
patriarch
among
all
the
gamekeepers
of
the
vale
he
was
a
short
wiry
old
man
with
grizzled
hair
and
a
wizened
face
tanned
brown
and
purple
by
constant
exposure
between
rheumatism
and
constant
handling
the
rod
and
gun
his
fingers
were
crooked
like
a
hawk
claws
he
kept
his
left
eye
always
shut
apparently
to
save
trouble
in
shooting
and
squinted
and
sniffed
and
peered
with
a
stooping
back
and
protruded
chin
as
if
he
were
perpetually
on
the
watch
for
fish
flesh
and
fowl
vermin
and
christian
the
friendship
between
himself
and
the
scotch
terrier
at
his
heels
would
have
been
easily
explained
by
lessing
for
in
the
transmigration
of
souls
the
spirit
of
harry
verney
had
evidently
once
animated
a
dog
of
that
breed
he
was
dressed
in
a
huge
thick
fustian
jacket
scratched
stained
and
patched
with
bulging
greasy
pockets
a
cast
of
flies
round
a
battered
hat
riddled
with
a
whistle
at
his
and
an
old
gun
cut
short
over
his
arm
bespoke
his
business
seed
that
crawy
against
ashy
down
plantations
last
night
i
be
sworn
said
he
in
a
squeaking
sneaking
tone
what
harm
was
the
man
doing
ay
that
the
way
you
young
talk
if
he
war
doing
mischief
he
a
been
glad
to
have
been
doing
it
i
warrant
if
i
been
as
young
as
you
i
have
picked
a
quarrel
with
him
soon
enough
and
found
a
cause
for
tackling
him
it
worth
a
brace
of
sovereigns
with
the
squire
to
haul
him
up
eh
eh
ai
old
harry
right
now
growled
the
younger
man
then
you
get
me
a
snare
and
a
hare
by
night
went
on
old
harry
see
if
i
do
nab
him
it
wo
lay
long
under
the
plantation
afore
he
picks
it
up
you
mind
to
snare
me
a
hare
now
do
no
such
thing
nor
help
to
bring
fake
accusations
against
any
man
accusations
answered
harry
in
his
cringing
way
at
that
now
for
a
keeper
to
say
why
if
he
do
happen
to
have
a
snare
just
there
he
has
somewhere
else
you
know
eh
ai
old
harry
right
now
eh
do
say
i
do
know
nothing
then
eh
what
matter
who
put
the
snare
down
or
the
hare
in
perwided
he
takes
it
up
man
if
was
he
be
all
the
better
pleased
the
most
notoriousest
poacher
as
walks
unhung
and
old
harry
lifted
up
his
crooked
hands
in
pious
indignation
have
no
more
gamekeeping
harry
what
with
hunting
down
christians
as
if
they
were
vermin
all
night
and
being
cursed
by
the
squire
all
day
i
sooner
be
a
sheriff
runner
or
a
negro
slave
ay
that
the
way
the
young
dogs
always
bark
afore
they
broke
in
and
gets
to
like
it
as
the
eels
does
skinning
have
i
bounced
pretty
near
out
of
my
skin
many
a
time
afore
now
on
this
here
very
bridge
with
harry
jump
in
you
stupid
hound
and
harry
get
out
you
tailor
and
then
if
one
of
the
gentlemen
lost
a
fish
with
their
clumsiness
oh
father
to
hear
let
out
at
me
and
my
and
curse
fit
to
fright
the
devil
dash
their
sarcy
tongues
eh
do
old
harry
know
their
ways
do
he
know
now
said
the
young
man
bitterly
break
the
dogs
and
we
load
the
guns
and
we
find
the
game
and
mark
the
game
and
then
they
call
themselves
sportsmen
we
choose
the
flies
and
we
bait
the
and
we
show
them
where
the
fish
lie
and
then
when
they
hooked
them
they
ca
get
them
out
without
us
and
the
spoonnet
and
then
they
go
home
to
the
ladies
and
boast
of
the
lot
of
fish
they
killed
and
who
thinks
of
the
keeper
ah
then
do
say
old
harry
knows
nothing
then
how
nicely
now
you
and
i
might
get
a
living
off
this
manor
if
the
landlords
was
served
like
the
french
ones
was
eh
paul
chuckled
old
harry
we
pay
our
taxes
with
pheasants
and
grayling
that
all
eh
ai
old
harry
right
now
eh
the
old
fox
was
fishing
for
an
assent
not
for
its
own
sake
for
he
was
a
fierce
tory
and
would
have
stood
up
to
be
shot
at
any
day
not
only
for
his
master
sake
but
for
the
sake
of
a
single
pheasant
of
his
master
but
he
hated
tregarva
for
many
reasons
and
was
daily
on
the
watch
to
entrap
him
on
some
of
his
peculiar
points
whereof
he
had
as
we
shall
find
a
good
many
what
would
have
been
tregarva
answer
i
can
not
tell
but
lancelot
who
had
unintentionally
overheard
the
greater
part
of
the
conversation
disliked
being
any
longer
a
listener
and
came
close
to
them
your
gudgeons
and
minnows
sir
as
you
bespoke
quoth
harry
here
that
paternoster
as
you
gave
me
to
rig
up
beautiful
minnows
sir
white
as
a
silver
they
the
ones
now
ai
they
sir
eh
do
then
do
say
old
harry
do
know
nothing
that
all
eh
and
the
old
fellow
toddled
off
peering
and
twisting
his
head
about
like
a
starling
odd
old
fellow
that
tregarva
said
lancelot
sir
considering
who
made
him
answered
the
cornishman
touching
his
hat
and
then
thrusting
his
nose
deeper
than
ever
into
the
stream
this
said
lancelot
who
had
a
continual
or
wrong
to
chat
with
his
inferiors
and
was
proportionately
sulky
and
reserved
to
his
superiors
enough
sir
said
the
keeper
with
an
emphasis
on
the
first
word
has
it
any
other
fault
so
wholesome
as
pretty
sir
harm
does
it
do
and
ague
and
rheumatism
sir
asked
lancelot
a
little
amused
by
the
man
laconic
answers
the
white
fog
spreads
sir
that
sir
when
sir
lancelot
burst
out
laughing
the
man
looked
up
at
him
slowly
and
seriously
would
laugh
sir
if
you
seen
much
of
the
inside
of
these
cottages
round
said
lancelot
was
only
laughing
at
our
making
such
very
short
work
of
such
a
long
and
serious
story
do
you
mean
that
the
unhealthiness
of
this
country
is
wholly
caused
by
the
river
sir
the
are
god
sending
and
so
they
are
not
too
bad
to
bear
but
there
more
of
man
sending
that
is
too
bad
to
bear
do
you
mean
men
likely
to
be
healthy
when
they
are
worse
housed
than
a
pig
worse
fed
than
a
hound
heavens
no
packed
together
to
sleep
like
pilchards
in
a
barrel
my
good
fellow
do
you
mean
that
the
labourers
here
are
in
that
state
is
far
to
walk
sir
perhaps
some
day
when
the
is
gone
off
and
the
fish
wo
rise
awhile
you
could
walk
down
and
see
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
though
for
thinking
of
such
a
thing
they
are
not
places
fit
for
gentlemen
that
certain
there
was
a
staid
irony
in
his
tone
which
lancelot
felt
the
clergyman
goes
sir
miss
honoria
goes
god
almighty
bless
her
do
not
they
see
that
all
goes
right
the
giant
twisted
his
huge
limbs
as
if
trying
to
avoid
an
answer
and
yet
not
daring
to
do
so
clergymen
go
about
among
the
poor
much
sir
at
college
before
they
are
ordained
lancelot
smiled
and
shook
his
head
thought
so
sir
our
good
vicar
is
like
the
rest
hereabouts
god
knows
he
stints
neither
time
nor
money
the
souls
of
the
poor
are
well
looked
after
and
their
bodies
too
as
far
as
his
purse
will
go
but
that
not
far
he
then
living
worth
some
forty
pounds
a
year
the
great
tithes
they
say
are
worth
better
than
twelve
hundred
but
squire
lavington
has
them
i
see
said
lancelot
glad
you
do
sir
for
i
do
meekly
answered
tregarva
the
vicar
sir
he
is
a
kind
man
and
a
good
but
the
poor
do
understand
him
nor
he
them
he
is
too
learned
sir
and
saving
your
presence
too
fond
of
his
ca
be
too
fond
of
a
good
thing
unless
you
make
an
idol
of
it
sir
and
fancy
that
men
souls
were
made
for
the
and
not
the
for
them
can
not
he
expose
and
redress
these
evils
if
they
exist
tregarva
twisted
about
again
do
not
say
that
i
think
it
sir
but
this
i
know
that
every
poor
man
in
the
vale
thinks
it
that
the
parsons
are
afraid
of
the
landlords
they
must
see
these
things
for
they
are
not
blind
and
they
try
to
plaster
them
up
out
of
their
own
pockets
why
in
god
name
do
they
strike
at
the
root
of
the
matter
and
go
straight
to
the
landlords
and
tell
them
the
truth
asked
lancelot
people
say
sir
i
see
no
reason
for
it
except
the
one
which
i
gave
you
besides
sir
you
must
remember
that
a
man
ca
quarrel
with
his
own
kin
and
so
many
of
them
are
their
squire
brothers
or
sons
or
nephews
good
friends
with
him
at
least
sir
and
to
do
them
justice
they
had
need
for
the
poor
sake
to
keep
good
friends
with
the
squire
how
else
are
they
to
get
a
farthing
for
schools
or
or
societies
or
lending
libraries
or
penny
clubs
if
they
spoke
their
minds
to
the
great
ones
sir
how
could
they
keep
the
parish
together
seem
to
see
both
sides
of
a
question
certainly
but
what
a
miserable
state
of
things
that
the
labouring
man
should
require
all
these
societies
and
charities
and
helps
from
the
rich
that
an
industrious
freeman
can
not
live
without
alms
i
have
thought
this
long
time
quietly
answered
tregarva
miss
honoria
she
is
not
afraid
to
tell
her
father
the
truth
sir
when
adam
and
eve
were
in
the
garden
that
all
the
devils
had
come
up
and
played
their
fiends
tricks
before
them
do
you
think
they
have
seen
any
shame
in
it
really
can
not
tell
said
lancelot
smiling
i
can
sir
they
have
seen
no
more
harm
in
it
than
there
was
harm
already
in
themselves
and
that
was
none
a
man
eyes
can
only
see
what
they
learnt
to
see
lancelot
started
it
was
a
favourite
dictum
of
his
in
carlyle
works
did
you
get
that
thought
my
seeing
sir
what
has
that
to
do
with
miss
honoria
is
an
angel
of
holiness
herself
sir
and
therefore
she
goes
on
without
blushing
or
suspecting
where
our
blood
would
boil
again
she
sees
people
in
want
and
thinks
it
must
be
so
and
pities
them
and
relieves
them
but
she
do
know
want
herself
and
therefore
she
do
know
that
it
makes
men
beasts
and
devils
she
as
pure
as
god
light
herself
and
therefore
she
fancies
every
one
is
as
spotless
as
she
is
and
there
another
mistake
in
your
charitable
great
people
sir
when
they
see
poor
folk
sick
or
hungry
before
their
eyes
they
pull
out
their
purses
fast
enough
god
bless
them
for
they
would
like
to
be
so
themselves
but
the
oppression
that
goes
on
all
the
year
round
and
the
want
that
goes
on
all
the
year
round
and
the
filth
and
the
lying
and
the
swearing
and
the
profligacy
that
go
on
all
the
year
round
and
the
sickening
weight
of
debt
and
the
miserable
grinding
anxiety
from
to
day
and
saturday
night
to
saturday
night
that
crushes
a
man
soul
down
and
drives
every
thought
out
of
his
head
but
how
he
is
to
fill
his
stomach
and
warm
his
back
and
keep
a
house
over
his
head
till
he
dare
for
his
life
take
his
thoughts
one
moment
off
the
meat
that
perisheth
oh
sir
they
never
felt
this
and
therefore
they
never
dream
that
there
are
thousands
who
pass
them
in
their
daily
walks
who
feel
this
and
feel
nothing
else
this
outburst
was
uttered
with
an
earnestness
and
majesty
which
astonished
lancelot
he
forgot
the
subject
in
the
speaker
are
a
very
extraordinary
gamekeeper
said
he
the
lord
shows
a
man
a
thing
he
ca
well
help
seeing
it
answered
tregarva
in
his
usual
staid
tone
there
was
a
pause
the
keeper
looked
at
him
with
a
glance
before
which
lancelot
eyes
fell
is
paved
with
hearsays
sir
and
as
all
this
talk
of
mine
is
hearsay
if
you
are
in
earnest
sir
go
and
see
for
yourself
i
know
you
have
a
kind
heart
and
they
tell
me
that
you
are
a
great
scholar
which
would
to
god
i
was
so
you
ought
not
to
condescend
to
take
my
word
for
anything
which
you
can
look
into
yourself
with
which
sound
piece
of
tregarva
returned
busily
to
his
me
the
rod
and
can
and
help
me
out
along
the
said
lancelot
must
have
some
more
talk
with
you
my
fine
fellow
answered
tregarva
as
he
assisted
our
lame
hero
along
a
huge
beam
which
stretched
out
into
the
pool
and
having
settled
him
there
returned
mechanically
to
his
work
humming
a
wesleyan
tune
lancelot
sat
and
tried
to
catch
perch
but
tregarva
words
haunted
him
he
lighted
his
cigar
and
tried
to
think
earnestly
over
the
matter
but
he
had
got
into
the
wrong
place
for
thinking
all
his
thoughts
all
his
sympathies
were
drowned
in
the
rush
and
whirl
of
the
water
he
forgot
everything
else
in
the
mere
animal
enjoyment
of
sight
and
sound
like
many
young
men
at
his
crisis
of
life
he
had
given
himself
up
to
the
mere
contemplation
of
nature
till
he
had
become
her
slave
and
now
a
luscious
scene
a
singing
bird
were
enough
to
allure
his
mind
away
from
the
most
earnest
and
awful
thoughts
he
tried
to
think
but
the
river
would
not
let
him
it
thundered
and
spouted
out
behind
him
from
the
hatches
and
leapt
madly
past
him
and
caught
his
eyes
in
spite
of
him
and
swept
them
away
down
its
dancing
waves
and
let
them
go
again
only
to
sweep
them
down
again
and
again
till
his
brain
felt
a
delicious
dizziness
from
the
everlasting
rush
and
the
everlasting
roar
and
then
below
how
it
spread
and
writhed
and
whirled
into
transparent
fans
hissing
and
twining
snakes
polished
huge
crystal
bells
which
boiled
up
from
the
bottom
and
dived
again
beneath
long
threads
of
creamy
foam
and
swung
round
posts
and
roots
and
rushed
blackening
under
dark
boughs
and
gnawed
at
the
marly
banks
and
shook
the
bulrushes
till
it
was
swept
away
and
down
over
the
white
pebbles
and
olive
weeds
in
one
broad
rippling
sheet
of
molten
silver
towards
the
distant
sea
downwards
it
fleeted
ever
and
bore
his
thoughts
floating
on
its
oily
stream
and
the
great
trout
with
their
yellow
sides
and
peacock
backs
lounged
among
the
eddies
and
the
silver
grayling
dimpled
and
wandered
upon
the
shallows
and
the
flickered
and
rustled
round
him
like
water
fairies
with
their
green
gauzy
wings
the
coot
clanked
musically
among
the
reeds
the
frogs
hummed
their
ceaseless
the
kingfisher
darted
from
his
hole
in
the
bank
like
a
blue
spark
of
electric
light
the
swallows
bills
snapped
as
they
twined
and
hawked
above
the
pool
the
swift
wings
whirred
like
as
they
rushed
screaming
past
his
head
and
ever
the
river
fleeted
by
bearing
his
eyes
away
down
the
current
till
its
wild
eddies
began
to
glow
with
crimson
beneath
the
setting
sun
the
complex
harmony
of
sights
and
sounds
slid
softly
over
his
soul
and
he
sank
away
into
a
still
daydream
too
passive
for
imagination
too
deep
for
meditation
and
born
of
murmuring
sound
did
pass
into
his
face
blame
him
not
there
are
more
things
in
a
man
heart
than
ever
get
in
through
his
thoughts
on
a
sudden
a
soft
voice
behind
him
startled
him
a
poor
cockney
artist
venture
himself
along
this
timber
without
falling
in
lancelot
turned
out
to
me
and
if
you
stumble
the
naiads
will
rise
out
of
their
depths
and
hold
up
their
pearled
wrists
to
save
their
favourite
the
artist
walked
timidly
out
along
the
beams
and
sat
down
beside
lancelot
who
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
claude
mellot
and
all
lovely
enthusiasms
and
symbolisms
expound
to
me
now
the
meaning
of
that
leaf
and
its
grand
simple
curve
as
it
lies
sleeping
there
in
the
back
eddy
i
am
too
amused
to
philosophise
the
fair
argemone
has
just
been
treating
me
to
her
three
hundred
and
philippic
against
my
unoffending
beard
what
fault
can
she
find
with
such
a
graceful
and
natural
ornament
this
my
dear
fellow
that
it
is
natural
as
it
is
she
considers
me
only
if
the
beard
were
away
my
face
she
says
would
be
so
refined
and
i
suppose
if
i
was
just
a
little
more
effeminate
and
pale
with
a
nice
retreating
and
a
drooping
lip
and
a
meek
peaking
simper
like
your
starved
romish
saints
i
should
be
so
spiritual
and
if
again
to
complete
the
climax
i
did
but
shave
my
head
like
a
chinese
i
should
be
a
model
for
francis
himself
really
after
all
why
make
yourself
so
singular
by
this
said
beard
wear
it
for
a
testimony
and
a
sign
that
a
man
has
no
right
to
be
ashamed
of
the
mark
of
manhood
oh
that
one
or
two
of
your
protestant
clergymen
who
ought
to
be
perfect
ideal
men
would
have
the
courage
to
get
up
into
the
pulpit
in
a
long
beard
and
testify
that
the
very
essential
idea
of
protestantism
is
the
dignity
and
divinity
of
man
as
god
made
him
our
forefathers
were
not
ashamed
of
their
beards
but
now
even
the
soldier
is
only
allowed
to
keep
his
moustache
while
our
masses
shave
themselves
as
close
as
they
can
and
in
proportion
to
a
man
piety
he
wears
less
hair
from
the
young
curate
who
shaves
off
his
whiskers
to
the
popish
priest
who
shaves
his
crown
do
you
say
then
to
cutting
off
nuns
hair
say
that
extremes
meet
and
prudish
manichaeism
always
ends
in
sheer
indecency
those
papists
have
forgotten
what
woman
was
made
for
and
therefore
they
have
forgotten
that
a
woman
hair
is
her
glory
for
it
was
given
to
her
for
a
covering
as
says
your
friend
paul
the
hebrew
who
by
the
bye
had
as
fine
theories
of
art
as
he
had
of
society
if
he
had
only
lived
fifteen
hundred
years
later
and
had
a
chance
of
working
them
out
remarkably
orthodox
you
are
said
lancelot
smiling
do
you
know
that
i
am
not
you
never
heard
me
deny
the
old
creed
but
what
if
an
artist
ought
to
be
of
all
creeds
at
once
my
business
is
to
represent
the
beautiful
and
therefore
to
accept
it
wherever
i
find
it
yours
is
to
be
a
philosopher
and
find
the
true
the
beautiful
must
be
truly
beautiful
to
be
worth
anything
and
so
you
too
must
search
for
the
true
truth
of
form
colour
chiaroscuro
they
are
worthy
to
occupy
me
a
life
for
they
are
eternal
or
at
least
that
which
they
express
and
if
i
am
to
get
at
the
symbolised
unseen
it
must
be
through
the
beauty
of
the
symbolising
phenomenon
if
i
who
live
by
art
for
art
in
art
or
you
either
who
seem
as
much
a
born
artist
as
myself
am
to
have
a
religion
it
must
be
a
worship
of
the
fountain
of
art
of
the
spirit
of
beauty
who
doth
consecrate
with
his
own
hues
he
shines
upon
poor
shelley
has
it
and
much
peace
of
mind
it
gave
him
answered
lancelot
have
grown
sick
lately
of
such
dreary
tinsel
abstractions
when
you
look
through
the
glitter
of
the
words
your
spirit
of
beauty
simply
means
certain
shapes
and
colours
which
please
you
in
beautiful
things
and
in
beautiful
people
nominalist
renegade
from
the
ideal
and
all
its
glories
said
claude
laughing
do
care
sixpence
now
for
the
ideal
i
want
not
beauty
but
some
beautiful
thing
a
woman
perhaps
and
he
sighed
at
least
a
person
a
living
loving
person
all
lovely
itself
and
giving
loveliness
to
all
things
if
i
must
have
an
ideal
let
it
be
for
mercy
sake
a
realised
one
claude
opened
his
shall
get
swamped
in
these
metaphysical
oceans
my
dear
dreamer
but
lo
here
come
a
couple
as
near
ideals
as
any
in
these
degenerate
days
the
two
poles
of
beauty
the
milieu
of
which
would
be
venus
with
us
pagans
or
the
virgin
mary
with
the
catholics
look
at
them
honoria
the
dark
symbolic
of
passionate
depth
argemone
the
fair
type
of
intellectual
light
oh
that
i
were
a
zeuxis
to
unite
them
instead
of
having
to
paint
them
in
two
separate
pictures
and
split
perfection
in
half
as
everything
is
split
in
this
piecemeal
world
will
have
the
honour
of
a
sitting
this
afternoon
i
suppose
from
both
beauties
hope
so
for
my
own
sake
there
is
no
path
left
to
immortality
or
bread
either
now
for
us
poor
artists
but
envy
you
your
path
when
it
leads
through
such
elysiums
said
lancelot
here
gentlemen
both
cried
argemone
from
the
bridge
caught
grumbled
lancelot
must
go
at
least
my
lameness
will
excuse
me
i
hope
the
two
ladies
were
accompanied
by
bracebridge
a
gazelle
which
he
had
given
argemone
and
a
certain
miserable
cur
of
honoria
adopting
who
plays
an
important
part
in
this
story
and
therefore
deserves
a
little
notice
honoria
had
rescued
him
from
a
watery
death
in
the
village
pond
by
means
of
the
colonel
who
had
revenged
himself
for
a
pair
of
wet
feet
by
utterly
corrupting
the
dog
morals
and
teaching
him
every
week
to
answer
to
some
fresh
scandalous
name
but
lancelot
was
not
to
escape
instead
of
moving
on
as
he
had
hoped
the
party
stood
looking
over
the
bridge
and
talking
he
took
for
granted
poor
fellow
of
him
and
for
once
his
suspicions
were
right
for
he
overheard
argemone
say
wonder
how
smith
can
be
so
rude
as
to
sit
there
in
my
presence
over
his
stupid
perch
smoking
those
horrid
cigars
too
how
selfish
those
do
make
men
you
said
the
colonel
with
a
low
bow
lancelot
rose
a
country
girl
now
had
spoken
in
that
tone
said
he
to
himself
would
have
been
called
at
least
saucy
but
mammon
elect
ones
may
do
anything
well
here
i
come
limping
to
my
new
tyrant
feet
like
goethe
bear
to
lili
she
drew
him
away
as
women
only
know
how
from
the
rest
of
the
party
who
were
chatting
and
laughing
with
claude
she
had
shown
off
her
fancied
indifference
to
lancelot
before
them
and
now
began
in
a
softer
voice
will
you
be
so
shy
and
lonely
mr
smith
i
am
not
fit
for
your
society
tells
you
so
why
will
you
not
become
so
lancelot
hung
down
his
head
long
as
fish
and
game
are
your
only
society
you
will
become
more
and
more
morne
and
fish
were
the
last
things
of
which
i
was
thinking
when
you
came
my
whole
heart
was
filled
with
the
beauty
of
nature
and
nothing
else
there
was
an
opening
for
one
of
argemone
preconcerted
orations
you
no
better
occupation
she
said
gently
nature
the
first
day
of
returning
to
the
open
air
after
so
frightful
and
dangerous
an
accident
were
there
no
thanks
due
to
one
above
lancelot
understood
her
do
you
know
that
i
was
not
even
then
showing
my
thankfulness
with
a
cigar
and
a
why
not
argemone
really
could
not
tell
at
the
moment
the
answer
upset
her
scheme
entirely
not
that
very
admiration
of
nature
have
been
an
act
of
worship
continued
our
hero
can
we
better
glorify
the
worker
than
by
delighting
in
his
work
sighed
the
lady
trust
to
these
methods
and
neglect
the
noble
and
exquisite
forms
which
the
church
has
prepared
for
us
as
embodiments
for
every
feeling
of
our
hearts
feeling
miss
lavington
argemone
hesitated
she
had
made
the
good
old
stock
assertion
as
in
duty
bound
but
she
could
not
help
recollecting
that
there
were
several
popish
books
of
devotion
at
that
moment
on
her
table
which
seemed
to
her
to
patch
a
gap
or
two
in
the
temple
as
yet
said
lancelot
only
the
heaven
and
the
earth
my
i
can
hear
all
day
long
whenever
i
have
the
sense
to
be
silent
and
hear
my
mother
sing
my
priests
and
preachers
are
every
bird
and
bee
every
flower
and
cloud
am
i
not
well
enough
furnished
do
you
want
to
reduce
my
circular
infinite
chapel
to
an
oblong
one
my
sphere
harmonies
to
the
gregorian
tones
in
four
parts
my
priesthood
with
their
endless
variety
of
costume
to
one
not
gentleman
in
a
white
sheet
and
my
dreams
of
naiads
and
and
the
ringing
god
praises
as
they
do
in
the
story
without
an
end
for
the
gross
reality
of
naughty
charity
children
with
their
pockets
full
of
apples
bawling
out
hebrew
psalms
of
which
they
neither
feel
nor
understand
a
word
argemone
tried
to
look
very
much
shocked
at
this
piece
of
bombast
lancelot
evidently
meant
it
as
such
but
he
eyed
her
all
the
while
as
if
there
was
solemn
earnest
under
the
surface
mr
smith
she
said
can
you
dare
talk
so
of
a
liturgy
compiled
by
the
wisest
and
holiest
of
all
countries
and
ages
you
revile
that
of
whose
beauty
you
are
not
qualified
to
judge
must
be
a
beauty
in
it
all
or
such
as
you
are
would
not
love
it
she
said
hopefully
you
would
but
try
the
church
system
how
you
would
find
it
harmonise
and
methodise
every
day
every
thought
for
you
but
i
can
not
explain
myself
why
not
go
to
our
vicar
and
open
your
doubts
to
him
but
you
must
excuse
me
he
is
one
of
the
saintliest
of
men
tell
the
truth
i
have
been
to
him
already
do
not
mean
it
and
what
did
he
tell
you
the
rest
of
the
world
does
hearsays
did
you
not
find
him
most
kind
went
to
him
to
be
comforted
and
guided
he
received
me
as
a
criminal
he
told
me
that
my
first
duty
was
penitence
that
as
long
as
i
lived
the
life
i
did
he
could
not
dare
to
cast
his
pearls
before
swine
by
answering
my
doubts
that
i
was
in
a
state
incapable
of
appreciating
spiritual
truths
and
therefore
he
had
no
right
to
tell
me
any
what
did
he
tell
you
spiritual
lies
instead
i
thought
he
told
me
hearing
me
quote
schiller
to
beware
of
the
germans
for
they
were
all
pantheists
at
heart
i
asked
him
whether
he
included
lange
and
bunsen
and
it
appeared
that
he
had
never
read
a
german
book
in
his
life
he
then
flew
furiously
at
carlyle
and
i
found
that
all
he
knew
of
him
was
from
a
certain
review
in
the
quarterly
he
called
boehmen
a
theosophic
atheist
i
should
have
burst
out
at
that
had
i
not
read
the
very
words
in
a
high
church
review
the
day
before
and
hoped
that
he
was
not
aware
of
the
impudent
falsehood
which
he
was
retailing
whenever
i
feebly
interposed
an
objection
to
anything
he
said
for
after
all
he
talked
on
he
told
me
to
hear
the
catholic
church
i
asked
him
which
catholic
church
he
said
the
english
i
asked
him
whether
it
was
to
be
the
church
of
the
sixth
century
or
the
thirteenth
or
the
seventeenth
or
the
eighteenth
he
told
me
the
one
and
eternal
church
which
belonged
as
much
to
the
nineteenth
century
as
to
the
first
i
begged
to
know
whether
then
i
was
to
hear
the
church
according
to
simeon
or
according
to
newman
or
according
to
paul
for
they
seemed
to
me
a
little
at
variance
he
told
me
austerely
enough
that
the
mind
of
the
church
was
embodied
in
her
liturgy
and
articles
to
which
i
answered
that
the
mind
of
the
episcopal
clergy
might
perhaps
be
but
then
how
happened
it
that
they
were
always
quarrelling
and
calling
hard
names
about
the
sense
of
those
very
documents
and
so
i
left
him
assuring
him
that
living
in
the
nineteenth
century
i
wanted
to
hear
the
church
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
no
other
and
should
be
most
happy
to
listen
to
her
as
soon
as
she
had
made
up
her
mind
what
to
say
argemone
was
angry
and
disappointed
she
felt
she
could
not
cope
with
lancelot
quaint
logic
which
however
unsound
cut
deeper
into
questions
than
she
had
yet
looked
for
herself
somehow
too
she
was
before
him
just
when
she
wanted
to
be
most
eloquent
in
behalf
of
her
principles
and
that
fretted
her
still
more
but
his
manner
puzzled
her
most
of
all
first
he
would
run
on
with
his
face
turned
away
as
if
soliloquising
out
into
the
air
and
then
suddenly
look
round
at
her
with
most
fascinating
humility
and
then
in
a
moment
a
dark
shade
would
pass
over
his
countenance
and
he
would
look
like
one
possessed
and
his
lips
wreathe
in
a
sinister
artificial
smile
and
his
wild
eyes
glare
through
and
through
her
with
such
cunning
understanding
of
himself
and
her
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
quailed
and
felt
frightened
as
if
in
the
power
of
a
madman
she
turned
hastily
away
to
shake
off
the
spell
he
sprang
after
her
almost
on
his
knees
and
looked
up
into
her
beautiful
face
with
an
imploring
cry
do
you
too
throw
me
off
will
you
too
treat
the
poor
wild
uneducated
sportsman
as
a
pariah
and
an
outcast
because
he
is
not
ashamed
to
be
a
man
because
he
can
not
stuff
his
soul
hunger
with
hearsays
but
dares
to
think
for
himself
because
he
wants
to
believe
things
and
dare
not
be
satisfied
with
only
believing
that
he
ought
to
believe
them
she
paused
astonished
yes
he
went
on
hoped
too
much
what
right
had
i
to
expect
that
you
would
understand
me
what
right
still
more
to
expect
that
you
would
stoop
any
more
than
the
rest
of
the
world
to
speak
to
me
as
if
i
could
become
anything
better
than
the
wild
hog
i
seem
oh
yes
the
chrysalis
has
no
butterfly
in
it
of
course
stamp
on
the
ugly
motionless
thing
and
yet
you
look
so
beautiful
and
good
are
all
my
dreams
to
perish
about
the
alrunen
and
how
they
charmed
our
old
fighting
hunting
forefathers
into
purity
and
sweet
obedience
among
their
saxon
forests
has
woman
forgotten
her
mission
to
look
at
the
heart
and
have
mercy
while
cold
man
looks
at
the
act
and
condemns
do
you
too
like
the
rest
of
mankind
think
better
than
misbelief
and
smile
on
hypocrisy
practical
atheism
sooner
than
on
the
unpardonable
sin
of
making
a
mistake
will
you
like
the
rest
of
this
wise
world
let
a
man
spirit
rot
asleep
into
the
pit
if
he
will
only
lie
quiet
and
not
disturb
your
smooth
respectabilities
but
if
he
dares
in
waking
to
yawn
in
an
unorthodox
manner
knock
him
on
the
head
at
once
and
break
the
bruised
reed
and
quench
the
smoking
flax
and
yet
you
churchgoers
have
renounced
the
world
do
you
want
in
heaven
name
asked
argemone
half
terrified
want
you
to
tell
me
that
here
i
am
with
youth
health
strength
money
every
blessing
of
life
but
one
and
i
am
utterly
miserable
i
want
some
one
to
tell
me
what
i
want
it
not
that
you
want
religion
see
hundreds
who
have
what
you
call
religion
with
whom
i
should
scorn
to
change
my
irreligion
smith
are
you
not
are
you
not
wicked
they
tell
me
so
said
argemone
with
an
effort
is
that
not
the
cause
of
your
disease
lancelot
laughed
fairest
prophetess
it
is
the
disease
itself
why
am
i
what
i
am
when
i
know
more
and
more
daily
what
i
could
be
that
is
the
mystery
and
my
sins
are
the
fruit
and
not
the
root
of
it
who
will
explain
that
argemone
began
church
miss
lavington
cried
he
impatiently
you
too
send
me
back
to
that
cold
abstraction
i
came
to
you
however
presumptuous
for
living
human
advice
to
a
living
human
heart
and
will
you
pass
off
on
me
that
the
church
which
in
every
man
mouth
has
a
different
meaning
in
one
book
meaning
a
method
of
education
only
it
has
never
been
carried
out
in
another
a
system
of
polity
only
it
has
never
been
realised
now
a
set
of
words
written
in
books
on
whose
meaning
all
are
divided
now
a
body
of
men
who
are
daily
excommunicating
each
other
as
heretics
and
apostates
now
a
universal
idea
now
the
narrowest
and
most
exclusive
of
all
parties
really
before
you
ask
me
to
hear
the
church
i
have
a
right
to
ask
you
to
define
what
the
church
is
articles
define
it
said
argemone
drily
visible
church
at
least
it
defines
as
a
company
of
faithful
men
in
which
etc
but
how
does
it
define
the
invisible
one
and
what
does
faithful
mean
what
if
i
thought
cromwell
and
pierre
leroux
infinitely
more
faithful
men
in
their
way
and
better
members
of
the
invisible
church
than
the
laud
or
the
facing
bothways
taylor
it
was
lucky
for
the
life
of
young
love
that
the
discussion
went
no
further
argemone
was
becoming
scandalised
beyond
all
measure
but
happily
the
colonel
interposed
here
tell
me
if
you
know
for
whom
this
sketch
is
meant
the
keeper
who
can
doubt
answered
they
both
at
once
not
mellot
succeeded
perfectly
said
lancelot
what
wonder
with
such
a
noble
subject
what
a
grand
benevolence
is
enthroned
on
that
lofty
forehead
you
would
say
so
indeed
interposed
honoria
you
knew
him
the
stories
that
i
could
tell
you
about
him
how
he
would
go
into
cottages
read
to
sick
people
by
the
hour
dress
the
children
cook
the
food
for
them
as
tenderly
as
any
woman
i
found
out
last
winter
if
you
will
believe
it
that
he
lived
on
bread
and
water
to
give
out
of
his
own
wages
which
are
barely
twelve
shillings
a
shillings
a
week
for
more
than
two
months
to
a
poor
labouring
man
to
prevent
his
going
to
the
workhouse
and
being
parted
from
his
wife
and
children
indeed
said
lancelot
do
not
wonder
now
at
the
effect
his
conversation
just
now
had
on
me
he
been
talking
to
you
said
honoria
eagerly
seldom
speaks
to
any
one
has
to
me
and
so
well
that
were
i
sure
that
the
poor
were
as
ill
off
as
he
says
and
that
i
had
the
power
of
altering
the
system
a
hair
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
excuse
all
political
and
turn
one
myself
claude
mellot
clapped
his
white
hands
bravo
o
wonderful
conversion
lancelot
has
at
last
discovered
that
besides
the
glorious
past
there
is
a
present
worthy
of
his
sublime
notice
we
may
now
hope
in
time
that
he
will
discover
the
existence
of
a
future
mellot
said
honoria
have
you
been
so
unfaithful
to
your
original
why
have
you
like
all
artists
been
trying
to
soften
and
refine
on
your
model
my
dear
lady
we
are
bound
to
see
everything
in
its
as
it
is
but
as
it
ought
to
be
and
will
be
when
the
vices
of
this
pitiful
civilised
world
are
exploded
and
sanitary
reform
and
a
variety
of
occupation
and
harmonious
education
let
each
man
fulfil
in
body
and
soul
the
ideal
which
god
embodied
in
him
cried
lancelot
laughing
surely
you
never
saw
a
face
which
had
lost
by
wear
less
of
the
divine
image
how
thoroughly
it
exemplifies
your
great
law
of
protestant
art
that
the
ideal
is
best
manifested
in
the
peculiar
how
classic
how
independent
of
clime
or
race
is
its
bland
majestic
possession
how
thoroughly
norse
its
massive
squareness
yet
as
a
cornishman
he
should
be
no
norseman
beg
your
pardon
like
all
noble
races
the
cornish
owe
their
nobleness
to
the
impurity
of
their
blood
to
its
perpetual
loans
from
foreign
veins
see
how
the
serpentine
curve
of
his
nose
his
long
nostril
and
protruding
lips
mark
his
share
of
phoenician
or
jewish
blood
how
norse
again
that
forehead
how
celtic
those
dark
curls
that
restless
gray
eye
with
its
swinden
blicken
like
von
troneg
hagen
in
the
niebelungen
lied
he
turned
honoria
was
devouring
his
words
he
saw
it
for
he
was
in
love
and
young
love
makes
man
senses
as
keen
as
woman
look
at
him
now
said
claude
in
a
low
voice
he
sits
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
the
enormous
size
of
his
limbs
quite
concealed
by
the
careless
grace
with
his
egyptian
face
like
some
dumb
granite
memnon
waiting
said
lancelot
the
to
arise
on
him
and
awake
him
into
voice
he
looked
at
honoria
as
he
spoke
she
blushed
angrily
and
yet
a
sort
of
sympathy
arose
from
that
moment
between
lancelot
and
herself
our
hero
feared
he
had
gone
too
far
and
tried
to
turn
the
subject
off
the
smooth
was
alive
with
rising
trout
a
huge
fish
leapt
then
said
lancelot
carelessly
close
to
the
bridge
too
honoria
looked
round
and
uttered
a
piercing
scream
my
dog
my
dog
mops
is
in
the
river
that
horrid
gazelle
has
butted
him
in
and
he
be
drowned
alas
it
was
too
true
there
a
yard
above
the
one
open
hatchway
through
which
the
whole
force
of
the
stream
was
rushing
was
the
unhappy
mops
alias
scratch
alias
dirty
dick
alias
jack
sheppard
paddling
and
sneezing
and
winking
his
little
bald
muzzle
turned
piteously
upward
to
the
sky
will
be
drowned
quoth
the
colonel
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
and
so
mops
thought
as
shivering
and
whining
he
plied
every
leg
while
the
glassy
current
dragged
him
back
and
back
and
honoria
sobbed
like
a
child
the
colonel
lay
down
on
the
bridge
and
caught
at
him
his
arm
was
a
foot
too
short
in
a
moment
the
huge
form
of
tregarva
plunged
solemnly
into
the
water
with
a
splash
like
seven
salmon
and
mops
was
jerked
out
over
the
colonel
head
high
and
dry
on
to
the
bridge
be
drowned
at
least
shouted
the
colonel
with
an
oath
of
uncle
toby
own
tregarva
saw
his
danger
made
one
desperate
bound
upward
and
missed
the
bridge
the
colonel
caught
at
him
tore
off
a
piece
of
his
collar
the
calm
solemn
face
of
the
keeper
flashed
past
beneath
him
and
disappeared
through
the
roaring
gate
they
rushed
to
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
caught
one
glimpse
of
a
dark
body
fleeting
and
roaring
down
the
the
colonel
leapt
the
like
a
deer
rushed
out
along
the
tore
off
his
coat
and
sprung
headlong
into
the
boiling
pool
in
his
might
as
old
homer
would
say
lancelot
forgetting
his
crutches
was
dashing
after
him
when
he
felt
a
soft
hand
clutching
at
his
arm
mr
smith
cried
argemone
shall
not
go
you
are
too
ill
weak
life
is
his
life
to
yours
she
cried
in
a
tone
of
deep
passion
and
then
imperiously
here
i
command
you
the
magnetic
touch
of
her
hand
thrilled
through
his
whole
frame
she
had
called
him
lancelot
he
shrank
down
and
stood
heavens
she
cried
at
my
sister
out
on
the
extremity
of
the
how
she
got
there
neither
they
nor
she
ever
knew
crouched
honoria
her
face
idiotic
with
terror
while
she
stared
with
bursting
eyes
into
the
foam
a
shriek
of
disappointment
rose
from
her
lips
as
in
a
moment
the
colonel
head
reappeared
above
looking
for
all
the
world
like
an
old
gray
seal
poof
poof
heave
me
a
piece
of
wood
lancelot
my
boy
and
he
disappeared
again
they
looked
round
there
was
not
a
loose
bit
near
claude
ran
off
towards
the
house
lancelot
desperate
seized
the
tore
it
off
by
sheer
strength
and
hurled
it
far
into
the
pool
argemone
saw
it
and
remembered
it
like
a
true
woman
ay
be
as
as
you
will
fair
ladies
physical
prowess
that
of
manhood
is
sure
to
tell
upon
your
hearts
again
the
colonel
grizzled
head
reappeared
and
oh
joy
beneath
it
a
draggled
knot
of
black
curls
in
another
instant
he
had
hold
of
the
rail
and
quietly
floating
down
to
the
shallow
dragged
the
lifeless
giant
high
and
dry
on
a
patch
of
gravel
honoria
never
spoke
she
rose
walked
quietly
back
along
the
beam
passed
argemone
and
lancelot
without
seeing
them
and
firmly
but
hurriedly
led
the
way
round
the
before
they
arrived
at
the
bank
the
colonel
had
carried
tregarva
to
it
lancelot
and
two
or
three
workmen
whom
his
cries
had
attracted
lifted
the
body
on
to
the
meadow
honoria
knelt
quietly
down
on
the
grass
and
watched
silent
and
motionless
the
dead
face
with
her
wide
awestruck
eyes
bless
her
for
a
kind
soul
whispered
the
wan
field
drudges
as
they
crowded
round
the
body
out
of
the
way
my
men
quoth
the
colonel
many
cooks
spoil
the
broth
and
he
packed
off
one
here
and
another
there
for
necessaries
and
commenced
trying
every
restorative
means
with
the
ready
coolness
of
a
practised
surgeon
while
lancelot
whom
he
ordered
about
like
a
baby
gulped
down
a
great
choking
lump
of
envy
and
then
tasted
the
rich
delight
of
forgetting
himself
in
admiring
obedience
to
a
real
superior
but
there
tregarva
lay
lifeless
with
folded
hands
and
a
quiet
satisfied
smile
while
honoria
watched
and
watched
with
parted
lips
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
every
one
five
minutes
ten
him
to
the
house
said
the
colonel
in
a
despairing
tone
after
another
attempt
moves
does
breathes
at
his
eyelids
slowly
his
eyes
opened
am
i
all
gone
sweet
dreams
blessed
dreams
his
eye
met
honoria
one
big
deep
sigh
swelled
to
his
lips
and
burst
she
seemed
to
recollect
herself
rose
passed
her
arm
through
argemone
and
walked
slowly
away
chapter
iv
an
argemone
sweet
prude
thought
herself
bound
to
read
honoria
a
lecture
that
night
on
her
reckless
exhibition
of
feeling
but
it
profited
little
the
most
consummate
cunning
could
not
have
baffled
argemone
suspicions
more
completely
than
her
sister
utter
simplicity
she
cried
just
as
bitterly
about
mops
danger
as
about
the
keeper
and
then
laughed
heartily
at
argemone
solemnity
till
at
last
when
pushed
a
little
too
hard
she
broke
out
into
something
very
like
a
passion
and
told
her
sister
bitterly
enough
that
was
not
accustomed
to
see
men
drowned
every
day
and
begged
to
hear
no
more
about
the
subject
whereat
argemone
prudently
held
her
tongue
knowing
that
under
all
honoria
tenderness
lay
a
volcano
of
passionate
determination
which
was
generally
kept
down
by
her
affections
but
was
just
as
likely
to
be
maddened
by
them
and
so
this
conversation
only
went
to
increase
the
unconscious
estrangement
between
them
though
they
continued
as
sisters
will
do
to
lavish
upon
each
other
the
most
extravagant
protestations
of
affection
vowing
to
live
and
die
only
for
each
other
and
believing
honestly
sweet
souls
that
they
felt
all
they
said
till
real
imperious
love
came
in
in
one
case
of
the
two
at
least
shouldering
all
other
affections
right
and
left
and
then
the
two
beauties
discovered
as
others
do
that
it
is
not
so
possible
or
reasonable
as
they
thought
for
a
woman
to
sacrifice
herself
and
her
lover
for
the
sake
of
her
sister
or
her
friend
next
morning
lancelot
and
the
colonel
started
out
to
tregarva
cottage
on
a
mission
of
inquiry
they
found
the
giant
propped
up
in
bed
with
pillows
his
magnificent
features
looking
in
their
paleness
more
than
ever
like
a
granite
memnon
before
him
lay
an
open
pilgrim
progress
and
a
drawer
filled
with
feathers
and
furs
which
he
was
busily
manufacturing
into
trout
flies
reading
as
he
worked
the
room
was
filled
with
nets
guns
and
keepers
tackle
while
a
filled
shelf
of
books
hung
by
the
wall
my
rising
gentlemen
he
said
in
his
slow
staid
voice
i
am
very
weak
in
spite
of
the
lord
goodness
to
me
you
are
very
kind
to
think
of
coming
to
my
poor
cottage
my
man
said
the
colonel
how
are
you
after
your
cold
bath
you
are
the
heaviest
fish
i
ever
landed
well
thank
god
and
you
sir
i
am
in
your
debt
sir
for
the
dear
life
how
shall
i
ever
repay
you
my
good
fellow
you
would
have
done
as
much
for
me
be
but
you
did
not
think
of
that
when
you
jumped
in
and
no
more
must
i
in
thanking
you
god
knows
how
a
poor
miner
son
will
ever
reward
you
but
the
mouse
repaid
the
lion
says
the
story
and
at
all
events
i
can
pray
for
you
by
the
bye
gentlemen
i
hope
you
have
brought
up
some
came
up
to
see
you
and
not
to
fish
said
lancelot
charmed
with
the
stately
courtesy
of
the
man
thanks
gentlemen
but
old
harry
verney
was
in
here
just
now
and
had
seen
a
great
jack
strike
at
the
tail
of
the
lower
reeds
with
this
fresh
wind
he
will
run
till
noon
and
you
are
sure
of
him
with
a
dace
after
that
he
will
not
be
up
again
on
the
shallows
till
sunset
he
works
the
works
of
darkness
and
comes
not
to
the
light
because
his
deeds
are
evil
lancelot
laughed
does
but
follow
his
kind
poor
fellow
doubt
sir
no
doubt
all
the
lord
works
are
good
but
it
is
a
wonder
why
he
should
have
made
wasps
now
and
blights
and
vermin
and
jack
and
such
things
that
carry
spite
and
cruelty
in
their
very
faces
a
great
wonder
do
you
think
sir
all
those
creatures
were
in
the
garden
of
eden

too
deep
for
me

lancelot

your
head
about
fishing
beg
your
pardon
for
preaching
to
you
sir
i
sure
i
forgot
myself
if
you
will
let
me
i
get
up
and
get
you
a
couple
of
bait
from
the
stew

do
us
keepers
a
kindness
and
prevent
sin
sir
if
you
catch
him
the
squire
will
swear
sadly
the
lord
forgive
him
if
he
hears
of
a
pike
in
the
i
get
up
if
i
may
trouble
you
to
go
into
the
next
room
a
minute
still
for
heaven
sake
why
bother
your
head
about
pike
now
is
my
business
sir
and
i
am
paid
for
it
and
i
must
do
it
thoroughly
and
abide
in
the
calling
wherein
i
am
called
he
added
in
a
sadder
tone
seem
to
be
fond
enough
of
it
and
to
know
enough
about
it
at
all
events
said
the
colonel
flies
here
on
a
for
being
fond
of
it
sir
those
creatures
of
the
water
teach
a
man
many
lessons
and
when
i
tie
flies
i
earn
books
then
send
my
flies
all
over
the
country
sir
to
salisbury
and
hungerford
and
up
to
winchester
even
and
the
money
buys
me
many
a
wise
book
all
my
delight
is
in
reading
perhaps
so
much
the
worse
for
me
much
the
better

answered
lancelot
warmly
give
you
an
order
for
a
couple
of
pounds
worth
of
flies
at
once
lord

sir
answered
the
giant

shall
make
me

same
quantity

the
colonel

a
lot
by
pattern
for
an
irish
gent

send

some
norway
patterns
and
some
golden
pheasant
and
parrot
feathers
we
going
to
norway
this
summer
you
know
lancelot
tregarva
looked
up
with
a
quaint
solemn
hesitation
you
please
gentlemen
you
forgive
a
man
conscience
i
not
like
to
be
a
party
to
the
making
of
norway
flies
a
protectionist
with
a
vengeance
laughed
the
colonel
you
want
to
keep
all
us
fishermen
in
england
eh
to
fee
english
keepers
sir
there
pretty
fishing
in
norway
i
hear
and
poor
folk
that
want
money
more
than
we
keepers
god
knows
we
get
too
much
we
that
hang
about
great
houses
and
serve
great
folks
pleasure
you
toss
the
money
down
our
throats
without
our
deserving
it
and
we
spend
it
as
we
get
it
a
deal
too
fast
while
labourers
are
starving
yet
you
would
keep
us
in
england
god
i
could
then
my
good
fellow
asked
lancelot
who
was
getting
intensely
interested
with
the
calm
earnestness
of
the
man
and
longed
to
draw
him
out
the
colonel
yawned
i
go
and
get
myself
a
couple
of
bait
do
you
stir
my
good
down
charge
i
say
odd
if
i
do
find
a
and
a
rod
for
myself
under
the
verandah
will
colonel
i
remember
now
i
set
it
there
last
morning
but
the
water
washed
many
things
out
of
my
brains
and
some
things
into
them
and
i
forgot
it
like
a
goose
and
lie
still
i
know
what
a
drowning
is
and
more
than
one
a
day
and
a
night
have
i
been
in
the
deep
like
the
man
in
the
good
book
and
bed
is
the
best
of
medicine
for
a
ducking
and
the
colonel
shook
him
kindly
by
the
hand
and
disappeared
lancelot
sat
down
by
the
keeper
bed
get
those
into
your
trousers
sir
and
this
is
a
poor
place
to
sit
down
in
want
you
to
say
your
say
out
friend
or
none
the
keeper
looked
warily
at
the
door
and
when
the
colonel
had
passed
the
window
balancing
the
on
his
chin
and
whistling
merrily
he
began
a
day
and
a
night
have
i
been
in
the
deep
and
brought
back
no
more
from
it
and
yet
the
psalms
say
how
they
that
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
see
the
works
of
the
lord
if
the
lord
has
opened
their
eyes
to
see
them
that
must
mean
lancelot
waited
a
gallant
gentleman
that
is
and
a
valiant
man
of
war
i
warrant
and
to
have
seen
all
the
wonders
he
has
and
yet
to
be
wasting
his
span
of
life
like
that
lancelot
heart
smote
him
would
think
sir
you
pardon
me
for
speaking
out
and
the
noble
face
worked
as
he
murmured
to
himself
ye
are
brought
before
kings
and
princes
for
my
name
i
dare
not
hold
my
tongue
sir
i
am
as
one
risen
from
the
dead
and
his
face
flashed
up
into
sudden
enthusiasm
woe
to
me
if
i
speak
not
oh
why
why
are
you
gentlemen
running
off
to
norway
and
foreign
parts
whither
god
has
not
called
you
are
there
no
graves
in
egypt
that
you
must
go
out
to
die
in
the
wilderness
lancelot
quite
unaccustomed
to
the
language
of
the
dissenting
poor
felt
keenly
the
bad
taste
of
the
allusion
can
you
mean
he
asked
me
sir
if
i
can
not
speak
plainly
but
are
there
not
temptations
enough
here
in
england
that
you
must
go
to
waste
all
your
gifts
your
scholarship
and
your
rank
far
away
there
out
of
the
sound
of
a
bell
i
do
deny
it
a
great
temptation
i
have
read
of
norway
wonders
in
a
book
of
one
miss
martineau
with
a
strange
name
on
the
fiord
it
sir
her
books
are
grand
books
to
set
one
but
she
do
seem
to
see
the
lord
in
all
things
does
she
sir
lancelot
parried
the
question
are
wandering
a
little
from
the
point
i
am
and
thank
you
for
the
rebuke
there
where
i
find
you
scholars
have
the
advantage
of
us
poor
fellows
who
pick
up
knowledge
as
we
can
your
makes
you
stick
to
the
point
so
much
better
you
are
taught
how
to
think
after
all
god
forgive
me
if
i
wrong
but
i
sometimes
think
that
there
must
be
more
good
in
that
human
wisdom
and
philosophy
falsely
so
called
than
we
wesleyans
hold
oh
sir
what
a
blessing
is
a
good
education
what
you
gentlemen
might
do
with
it
if
you
did
but
see
your
own
power
are
there
no
fish
in
england
sir
to
be
caught
precious
fish
with
immortal
souls
and
is
there
not
one
who
has
said
come
with
me
and
i
will
make
you
fishers
of
men
you
have
us
all
turn
parsons
no
one
to
do
god
work
except
the
parson
sir
oh
the
game
that
you
rich
folks
have
in
your
hands
if
you
would
but
play
it
such
a
man
as
colonel
bracebridge
now
with
the
tongue
of
the
serpent
who
can
charm
any
living
soul
he
likes
to
his
will
as
a
stoat
charms
a
rabbit
or
you
sir
with
your
tongue
you
have
charmed
one
precious
creature
already
i
can
see
it
though
neither
of
you
know
it
yet
i
know
it
lancelot
started
and
blushed
crimson
that
i
had
your
tongue
sir
and
the
keeper
blushed
crimson
too
and
went
on
hastily
why
could
you
not
charm
all
alike
do
not
the
poor
want
you
as
well
as
the
rich
can
i
do
for
the
poor
my
good
fellow
and
what
do
they
want
have
they
not
houses
work
a
church
and
schools
and
to
fall
back
on
the
keeper
smiled
sadly
fall
back
on
indeed
and
down
on
too
at
all
events
you
rich
might
help
to
make
christians
of
them
and
men
of
them
for
i
beginning
to
fancy
strangely
in
spite
of
all
the
preachers
say
that
before
ever
you
can
make
them
christians
you
must
make
them
men
and
women
they
not
so
already
sir
go
and
see
how
can
a
man
be
a
man
in
those
crowded
styes
sleeping
packed
together
like
irish
pigs
in
a
steamer
never
out
of
the
fear
of
want
never
knowing
any
higher
amusement
than
the
those
old
greeks
and
romans
as
i
read
were
more
like
men
than
half
our
english
labourers
go
and
see
ask
that
sweet
heavenly
angel
miss
honoria
and
the
keeper
again
blushed
she
too
will
tell
you
i
think
sometimes
if
she
had
been
born
and
bred
like
her
father
tenants
daughters
to
sleep
where
they
sleep
and
hear
the
talk
they
hear
and
see
the
things
they
see
what
would
she
have
been
now
we
must
think
of
it
and
the
keeper
turned
his
head
away
and
fairly
burst
into
tears
lancelot
was
moved
the
poor
very
immoral
then
ask
the
rector
sir
how
many
children
hereabouts
are
born
within
six
months
of
the
none
of
them
marry
sir
till
the
devil
forces
them
there
no
sadder
sight
than
a
labourer
wedding
you
never
see
the
parents
come
with
them
they
just
get
another
couple
that
are
keeping
company
like
themselves
and
come
sneaking
into
church
looking
all
over
as
if
they
were
ashamed
of
it
and
well
they
may
be
it
possible
say
sir
that
god
makes
you
gentlemen
gentlemen
that
you
may
see
into
these
things
you
give
away
your
charities
kindly
enough
but
you
do
know
the
folks
you
give
to
if
a
few
of
you
would
but
be
like
the
blessed
lord
and
stoop
to
go
out
of
the
road
just
behind
the
hedge
for
once
among
the
publicans
and
harlots
were
you
ever
at
a
country
fair
sir
though
i
suppose
i
am
rude
for
fancying
that
you
could
demean
yourself
to
such
company
should
not
think
it
demeaning
myself
said
lancelot
smiling
i
never
was
at
one
and
i
should
like
for
once
to
see
the
real
manners
of
the
poor
no
haunter
of
such
places
myself
god
knows
but
i
see
you
in
earnest
now
will
you
come
with
me
sir
for
once
for
god
sake
and
the
poor
sake
shall
be
delighted
after
you
been
there
i
am
afraid
it
a
bargain
when
you
are
recovered
and
in
the
meantime
the
squire
orders
are
that
you
lie
by
for
a
few
days
to
rest
and
miss
honoria
too
and
she
has
sent
you
down
some
wine
thought
of
me
did
she
and
the
still
sad
face
blazed
out
radiant
with
pleasure
and
then
collapsed
as
suddenly
into
deep
melancholy
lancelot
saw
it
but
said
nothing
and
shaking
him
heartily
by
the
hand
had
his
shake
returned
by
an
iron
grasp
and
slipped
silently
out
of
the
cottage
the
keeper
lay
still
gazing
on
vacancy
once
he
murmured
to
himself
strange
ways
strange
ways
and
though
he
let
them
wander
out
of
the
road
in
the
wilderness
we
know
how
that
goes
on
and
then
he
fell
into
a
mixed
meditation
perhaps
into
a
prayer
chapter
v
a
sham
is
worse
than
nothing
at
last
after
lancelot
had
waited
long
in
vain
came
his
cousin
answer
to
the
letter
which
i
gave
in
my
second
chapter
are
not
fair
to
me
good
cousin
but
i
have
given
up
expecting
fairness
from
protestants
i
do
not
say
that
the
front
and
the
back
of
my
head
have
different
makers
any
more
than
that
doves
and
vipers
have
and
yet
i
kill
the
viper
when
i
meet
him
and
so
do
and
yet
are
we
not
taught
that
our
animal
nature
is
throughout
equally
viperous
the
catholic
church
at
least
so
she
believes
in
the
corruption
of
human
nature
she
believes
in
the
literal
meaning
of
scripture
she
has
no
wish
to
paraphrase
away
paul
awful
words
that
in
his
flesh
dwelleth
no
good
thing
by
the
unscientific
euphemisms
of
fallen
nature
or
corrupt
humanity
the
boasted
discovery
of
phrenologists
that
thought
feeling
and
passion
reside
in
this
material
brain
and
nerves
of
ours
has
ages
ago
been
anticipated
by
her
simple
faith
in
the
letter
of
scripture
a
faith
which
puts
to
shame
the
irreverent
vagueness
and
fantastic
private
interpretations
of
those
who
make
an
idol
of
that
very
letter
which
they
dare
not
take
literally
because
it
makes
against
their
theories
so
you
call
me
douce
and
meek
you
should
remember
what
i
once
was
lancelot
i
at
least
have
not
forgotten
i
have
not
forgotten
how
that
very
animal
nature
on
the
possession
of
which
you
seem
to
pride
yourself
was
in
me
only
the
parent
of
i
know
it
too
well
not
to
hate
and
fear
it
why
do
you
reproach
me
if
i
try
to
abjure
it
and
cast
away
the
burden
which
i
am
too
weak
to
bear
i
am
weak
would
you
have
me
say
that
i
am
strong
would
you
have
me
try
to
be
a
prometheus
while
i
am
longing
to
be
once
more
an
infant
on
a
mother
breast
let
me
alone
i
am
a
weary
child
who
knows
nothing
can
do
nothing
except
lose
its
way
in
arguings
and
reasonings
and
find
no
end
in
wandering
mazes
lost
will
you
reproach
me
because
when
i
see
a
soft
cradle
lying
open
for
me
with
a
virgin
mother
face
smiling
down
all
woman
love
about
it
i
long
to
crawl
into
it
and
sleep
awhile
i
want
loving
indulgent
sympathy
i
want
detailed
explicit
guidance
have
you
then
found
so
much
of
them
in
our
former
creed
that
you
forbid
me
to
go
to
seek
them
elsewhere
in
the
church
which
not
only
professes
them
as
an
organised
system
but
practises
them
as
you
would
find
in
your
first
talk
with
one
of
her
priests
true
priests
who
know
the
heart
of
man
and
pity
and
console
and
bear
for
their
flock
the
burdens
which
they
can
not
bear
themselves
you
ask
me
who
will
teach
a
fast
young
man
i
answer
the
jesuit
ay
start
and
sneer
at
that
delicate
tenderness
that
subtle
instinctive
sympathy
which
you
have
never
felt
which
is
as
new
to
me
alas
as
it
would
be
to
you
for
if
there
be
none
days
to
teach
such
as
you
who
is
there
who
will
teach
such
as
me
do
not
fancy
that
i
have
not
craved
and
searched
for
teachers
i
went
to
one
party
long
ago
and
they
commanded
me
as
the
price
of
their
sympathy
even
of
anything
but
their
denunciations
to
ignore
if
not
to
abjure
all
the
very
points
on
which
i
came
for
light
my
love
for
the
beautiful
and
the
symbolic
my
desire
to
consecrate
and
christianise
it
my
longing
for
a
human
voice
to
tell
me
with
authority
that
i
was
forgiven
my
desire
to
find
some
practical
and
palpable
communion
between
myself
and
the
saints
of
old
they
told
me
to
cast
away
as
an
accursed
chaos
a
thousand
years
of
christian
history
and
believe
that
the
devil
had
been
for
ages
just
the
ages
i
thought
noblest
most
faithful
most
interpenetrated
with
the
thought
of
god
triumphant
over
that
church
with
which
he
had
promised
to
be
till
the
end
of
the
world
no
by
the
bye
they
made
two
exceptions
of
their
own
choosing
one
in
favour
of
the
albigenses
who
seemed
to
me
from
the
original
documents
to
have
been
very
profligate
infidels
of
whom
the
world
was
well
rid
and
the
piedmontese
poor
simple
folk
enough
but
who
certainly
can
not
be
said
to
have
exercised
much
influence
on
the
destinies
of
mankind
and
all
the
rest
was
chaos
and
the
pit
there
never
had
been
never
would
be
a
kingdom
of
god
on
earth
but
only
a
few
scattered
individuals
each
selfishly
intent
on
the
salvation
of
his
own
soul
without
organisation
without
unity
without
common
purpose
without
even
a
masonic
sign
whereby
to
know
one
another
when
they
chanced
to
meet
except
shibboleths
which
the
hypocrite
could
ape
and
virtues
which
the
heathen
have
performed
would
you
have
had
me
accept
such
a
philosophy
of
history
then
i
went
to
another
school
or
rather
wandered
up
and
down
between
those
whom
i
have
just
described
and
those
who
boast
on
their
side
prescriptive
right
and
apostolic
succession
and
i
found
that
their
ancient
charter
went
back
just
three
hundred
years
and
there
derived
its
transmitted
virtue
it
seemed
to
me
by
something
very
like
obtaining
goods
on
false
pretences
from
the
very
church
which
it
now
anathematises
disheartened
but
not
hopeless
i
asked
how
it
was
that
the
priesthood
whose
hands
bestowed
the
grace
of
ordination
could
not
withdraw
it
whether
at
least
the
schismatic
did
not
forfeit
it
by
the
very
act
of
schism
and
instead
of
any
real
answer
to
that
fearful
spiritual
dilemma
they
set
me
down
to
folios
of
nag
head
controversies
and
myths
of
an
independent
british
church
now
represented
strangely
enough
by
those
saxons
who
after
its
wicked
refusal
to
communicate
with
them
exterminated
it
with
fire
and
sword
and
derived
its
own
order
from
gregory
and
decisions
of
mythical
old
councils
held
by
bishops
of
a
different
faith
and
practice
from
their
own
from
which
i
was
to
pick
the
one
point
which
made
for
them
and
omit
the
nine
which
made
against
them
while
i
was
to
believe
by
a
stretch
of
imagination
or
common
honesty
which
i
leave
you
to
conceive
that
the
church
of
syria
in
the
fourth
century
was
in
doctrine
practice
and
constitution
like
that
of
england
in
the
nineteenth
and
what
was
i
to
gain
by
all
this
for
the
sake
of
what
was
i
to
strain
logic
and
conscience
to
believe
myself
a
member
of
the
same
body
with
all
the
christian
nations
of
the
earth
to
be
able
to
hail
the
frenchman
the
italian
the
spaniard
as
a
brother
to
have
hopes
even
of
the
german
and
the
swede
if
not
in
this
life
still
in
the
life
to
come
no
to
be
able
still
to
sit
apart
from
all
christendom
in
the
exclusive
pride
of
insular
pharisaism
to
claim
for
the
modern
littleness
of
england
the
infallibility
which
i
denied
to
the
primaeval
mother
of
christendom
not
to
enlarge
my
communion
to
the
catholic
but
excommunicate
to
all
practical
purposes
over
and
above
the
catholics
all
other
protestants
except
my
own
sect
or
rather
in
practice
except
my
own
party
in
my
own
and
this
was
believing
in
one
catholic
and
apostolic
church
this
was
to
be
my
share
of
the
communion
of
saints
and
these
were
the
theories
which
were
to
satisfy
a
soul
which
longed
for
a
kingdom
of
god
on
earth
which
felt
that
unless
the
highest
of
his
promises
are
a
mythic
dream
there
must
be
some
system
on
the
earth
commissioned
to
fulfil
those
promises
some
authority
divinely
appointed
to
regenerate
and
rule
and
guide
the
lives
of
men
and
the
destinies
of
nations
who
must
go
mad
unless
he
finds
that
history
is
not
a
dreary
aimless
procession
of
lost
spirits
descending
into
the
pit
or
that
the
salvation
of
millions
does
not
depend
on
an
obscure
and
controverted
hair
breadth
of
ecclesiastic
law
have
tried
them
both
lancelot
and
found
them
wanting
and
now
but
one
road
home
to
the
to
the
mother
of
all
the
churches
whose
fancied
cruelty
to
her
children
can
no
more
destroy
her
motherhood
than
their
confest
rebellion
shall
i
not
hear
her
voice
when
she
and
she
alone
cries
to
me
i
have
authority
and
commission
from
the
king
of
kings
to
regenerate
the
world
history
is
a
chaos
only
because
mankind
has
been
ever
rebelling
against
me
its
lawful
ruler
and
yet
not
a
chaos
for
i
still
stand
and
grow
rooted
on
the
rock
of
ages
and
under
my
boughs
are
fowl
of
every
wing
i
alone
have
been
and
am
consistent
progressive
expansive
welcoming
every
race
and
intellect
and
character
into
its
proper
place
in
my
great
organism
meeting
alike
the
wants
of
the
king
and
the
beggar
the
artist
and
the
devotee
there
is
free
room
for
all
within
my
wide
bosom
infallibility
is
not
the
exclusive
heritage
of
one
proud
and
ignorant
island
but
of
a
system
which
knows
no
distinction
of
language
race
or
clime
the
communion
of
saints
is
not
a
bygone
tale
for
my
saints
redeemed
from
every
age
and
every
nation
under
heaven
still
live
and
love
and
help
and
intercede
the
union
of
heaven
and
earth
is
not
a
barbaric
myth
for
i
have
still
my
miracles
my
host
my
exorcism
my
absolution
the
present
rule
of
god
is
still
as
ever
a
living
reality
for
i
rule
in
his
name
and
fulfil
all
his
will
can
i
turn
away
from
such
a
voice
what
if
some
of
her
doctrines
may
startle
my
untutored
and
ignorant
understanding
if
she
is
the
appointed
teacher
she
will
know
best
what
truths
to
the
disciple
is
not
above
his
master
or
wise
in
requiring
him
to
demonstrate
the
abstrusest
problems
spiritual
problems
too
before
he
allows
his
right
to
teach
the
elements
humbly
i
must
enter
the
temple
porch
gradually
and
trustfully
proceed
with
my
when
that
is
past
and
not
before
shall
i
be
a
fit
judge
of
the
mysteries
of
the
inner
shrine
i
have
written
a
long
letter
with
my
own
heart
think
over
it
well
before
you
despise
and
if
you
can
refute
it
for
me
and
sweep
the
whole
away
like
a
wild
dream
when
one
awakes
none
will
be
more
thankful
paradoxical
as
it
may
seem
than
your
unhappy
cousin
and
lancelot
did
consider
that
letter
and
answered
it
as
follows
is
a
relief
to
me
at
least
dear
luke
that
you
are
going
to
rome
in
search
of
a
great
idea
and
not
merely
from
selfish
superstitious
terror
as
i
should
call
it
about
the
salvation
of
your
soul
and
it
is
a
new
and
very
important
thought
to
me
that
rome
scheme
of
this
world
rather
than
of
the
next
forms
her
chief
allurement
but
as
for
that
flesh
and
spirit
question
or
the
apostolic
succession
one
either
all
you
seem
to
me
as
a
looker
on
to
have
logically
proved
is
that
protestants
orthodox
and
unorthodox
must
be
a
little
more
scientific
and
careful
in
their
use
of
the
terms
but
as
for
adopting
your
use
of
them
and
the
consequences
thereof
you
must
pardon
me
and
i
suspect
them
too
not
that
anything
but
that
whatever
is
right
that
is
wrong
better
to
be
inconsistent
in
truth
than
consistent
in
a
mistake
and
your
romish
idea
of
man
is
a
mistake
utterly
wrong
and
absurd
except
in
the
one
requirement
of
righteousness
and
godliness
which
protestants
and
heathen
philosophers
have
required
and
do
require
just
as
much
as
you
my
dear
luke
your
ideal
men
and
women
wo
do
for
they
are
not
men
and
women
at
all
but
what
you
call
saints
your
calendar
your
historic
list
of
the
earth
worthies
wo
do
not
they
but
others
are
the
people
who
have
brought
humanity
thus
far
i
do
deny
that
there
are
great
souls
among
them
beckets
and
hugh
grostetes
and
elizabeths
of
hungary
but
you
are
the
last
people
to
praise
them
for
you
do
understand
them
thierry
honours
thomas
a
becket
more
than
all
canonisations
and
worshippers
do
because
he
does
see
where
the
man
true
greatness
lay
and
you
do
why
you
may
hunt
all
surius
for
such
a
biography
of
a
mediaeval
worthy
as
carlyle
has
given
of
your
abbot
samson
i
have
read
or
tried
to
read
your
surius
and
alban
butler
and
so
forth
and
they
seemed
to
me
bats
and
asses
one
really
pitied
the
poor
saints
and
martyrs
for
having
such
blind
biographers
such
dunghill
cocks
who
overlooked
the
pearl
of
real
human
love
and
nobleness
in
them
in
their
greediness
to
snatch
up
and
parade
the
rotten
chaff
of
superstition
and
and
spiritual
dyspepsia
which
had
overlaid
it
my
dear
fellow
that
calendar
ruins
your
cause
you
are
sacres
aristocrates
kings
and
queens
bishops
and
virgins
by
the
hundred
at
one
end
a
beggar
or
two
at
the
other
and
but
one
real
human
lay
homobonus
to
fill
up
the
great
gulf
between
a
pretty
list
to
allure
the
english
middle
classes
or
the
lancashire
almost
as
charmingly
suited
to
england
as
the
present
free
industrious
enlightened
and
moral
state
of
that
eternal
city
which
has
been
blest
with
the
visible
presence
and
peculiar
rule
temporal
as
well
as
spiritual
too
of
your
dalai
lama
his
pills
do
not
seem
to
have
had
much
practical
effect
my
good
luke
till
he
can
show
us
a
little
better
specimen
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
organised
and
realised
on
earth
in
the
country
which
does
belong
to
him
soil
and
people
body
and
soul
we
must
decline
his
assistance
in
realising
that
kingdom
in
countries
which
do
belong
to
him
if
the
state
of
rome
do
show
his
idea
of
man
and
society
to
be
a
rotten
lie
what
proof
would
you
have
perhaps
the
charming
results
of
a
century
of
jesuitocracy
as
they
were
represented
on
a
french
stage
in
the
year
i
ca
answer
his
arguments
you
see
or
yours
either
i
am
an
englishman
and
not
a
controversialist
the
only
answer
i
give
is
john
bull
old
dumb
instinctive
everlasting
no
which
he
will
stand
by
if
need
be
with
sharp
shot
and
cold
steel
not
that
anything
but
that
no
kingdom
of
heaven
at
all
for
us
if
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
that
no
heroes
at
all
for
us
if
their
heroism
is
to
consist
in
their
being
better
no
society
at
all
but
only
a
competitive
den
than
a
sham
society
better
no
faith
no
hope
no
love
no
god
than
shams
thereof
i
take
my
stand
on
fact
and
nature
you
may
call
them
idols
and
phantoms
i
say
they
need
be
so
no
longer
to
any
man
since
bacon
has
taught
us
to
discover
the
eternal
laws
under
the
outward
phenomena
here
on
blank
materialism
will
i
stand
and
testify
against
all
religions
and
gods
whatsoever
if
they
must
needs
be
like
that
roman
religion
that
roman
god
i
do
believe
they
need
not
i
but
if
they
need
they
must
go
we
can
not
have
a
deus
quidam
deceptor
if
there
be
a
god
these
trees
and
stones
these
beasts
and
birds
must
be
his
will
whatever
else
is
not
my
body
and
brain
and
faculties
and
appetites
must
be
his
will
whatever
else
is
not
whatsoever
i
can
do
with
them
in
accordance
with
the
constitution
of
them
and
nature
must
be
his
will
whatever
else
is
not
those
laws
of
nature
must
reveal
him
and
be
revealed
by
him
whatever
else
is
not
man
scientific
conquest
of
nature
must
be
one
phase
of
his
kingdom
on
earth
whatever
else
is
not
i
do
deny
that
there
are
spiritual
laws
which
man
is
meant
to
can
i
who
feel
in
my
own
daily
and
inexplicable
unhappiness
the
fruits
of
having
broken
them
but
i
do
say
that
those
spiritual
laws
must
be
in
perfect
harmony
with
every
fresh
physical
law
which
we
discover
that
they
can
not
be
intended
to
compete
with
each
other
that
the
spiritual
can
not
be
intended
to
be
perfected
by
ignoring
or
crushing
the
physical
unless
god
is
a
deceiver
and
his
universe
a
and
by
this
test
alone
will
i
try
all
theories
and
dogmas
and
spiritualities
whatsoever
are
they
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
nature
and
therefore
when
your
party
compare
sneeringly
romish
sanctity
and
english
civilisation
i
say
take
you
the
sanctity
and
give
me
the
civilisation
the
one
may
be
a
dream
for
it
is
unnatural
the
other
can
not
be
for
it
is
natural
and
not
an
evil
in
it
at
which
you
sneer
but
is
discovered
day
by
day
to
be
owing
to
some
infringement
of
the
laws
of
nature
when
we
draw
bills
on
nature
as
carlyle
says
she
honours
them
our
ships
do
sail
our
mills
do
work
our
doctors
do
cure
our
soldiers
do
fight
and
she
does
not
honour
yours
for
your
jesuits
have
by
their
own
confession
to
lie
to
swindle
to
get
even
man
to
accept
theirs
for
them
so
give
me
the
political
economist
the
sanitary
reformer
the
engineer
and
take
your
saints
and
virgins
relics
and
miracles
the
and
the
railroad
cunard
liners
and
the
electric
telegraph
are
to
me
if
not
to
you
signs
that
we
are
on
some
points
at
least
in
harmony
with
the
universe
that
there
is
a
mighty
spirit
working
among
us
who
can
not
be
your
anarchic
and
destroying
devil
and
therefore
may
be
the
ordering
and
creating
god
which
of
them
do
you
think
reader
had
most
right
on
his
side
chapter
vi
vogue
la
galere
lancelot
was
now
so
far
improved
in
health
as
to
return
to
his
little
cottage
ornee
he
gave
himself
up
freely
to
his
new
passion
with
his
comfortable
fortune
and
good
connections
the
future
seemed
bright
and
possible
enough
as
to
circumstances
he
knew
that
argemone
felt
for
him
how
much
it
seemed
presumptuous
even
to
speculate
and
as
yet
no
meteor
had
arisen
portentous
in
his
amatory
zodiac
no
rich
man
had
stepped
in
to
snatch
in
spite
of
all
his
own
flocks
and
herds
at
the
poor
man
own
lamb
and
set
him
barking
at
all
the
world
as
many
a
poor
lover
has
to
do
in
defence
of
his
morsel
of
enjoyment
now
turned
into
a
mere
bone
of
contention
and
loadstone
for
all
hungry
kites
and
crows
all
that
had
to
be
done
was
to
render
himself
worthy
of
her
and
in
doing
so
to
win
her
and
now
he
began
to
feel
more
painfully
his
ignorance
of
society
of
practical
life
and
the
outward
present
he
blamed
himself
angrily
for
having
as
he
now
thought
wasted
his
time
on
ancient
histories
and
foreign
travels
while
he
neglected
the
living
wonderful
present
which
weltered
daily
round
him
every
face
embodying
a
living
soul
for
now
he
began
to
feel
that
those
faces
did
hide
living
souls
formerly
he
had
half
believed
he
had
tried
but
from
laziness
to
make
himself
wholly
believe
that
they
were
all
empty
masks
phantasies
without
interest
or
significance
for
him
but
somehow
in
the
light
of
his
new
love
for
argemone
the
whole
human
race
seemed
glorified
brought
nearer
endeared
to
him
so
it
must
be
he
had
spoken
of
a
law
wider
than
he
thought
in
his
fancy
that
the
angels
might
learn
love
for
all
by
love
for
an
individual
do
we
not
all
learn
love
so
is
it
not
the
first
touch
of
the
mother
bosom
which
awakens
in
the
infant
heart
that
spark
of
affection
which
is
hereafter
to
spread
itself
out
towards
every
human
being
and
to
lose
none
of
its
devotion
for
its
first
object
as
it
expands
itself
to
innumerable
new
ones
is
it
not
by
love
too
by
looking
into
loving
human
eyes
by
feeling
the
care
of
loving
hands
that
the
infant
first
learns
that
there
exist
other
beings
beside
itself
that
every
body
which
it
sees
expresses
a
heart
and
will
like
its
own
be
sure
of
it
be
sure
that
to
have
found
the
key
to
one
heart
is
to
have
found
the
key
to
all
that
truly
to
love
is
truly
to
know
and
truly
to
love
one
is
the
first
step
towards
truly
loving
all
who
bear
the
same
flesh
and
blood
with
the
beloved
like
children
we
must
dress
up
even
our
unseen
future
in
stage
properties
borrowed
from
the
tried
and
palpable
present
ere
we
can
look
at
it
without
horror
we
fear
and
hate
the
utterly
unknown
and
it
only
even
pain
we
hate
only
when
we
can
not
know
it
when
we
can
only
feel
it
without
explaining
it
and
making
it
harmonise
with
our
notions
of
our
own
deserts
and
destiny
and
as
for
human
beings
there
surely
it
stands
true
wherever
else
it
may
not
that
all
knowledge
is
love
and
all
love
knowledge
that
even
with
the
meanest
we
can
not
gain
a
glimpse
into
their
inward
trials
and
struggles
without
an
increase
of
sympathy
and
affection
whether
he
reasoned
thus
or
not
lancelot
found
that
his
new
interest
in
the
working
classes
was
strangely
quickened
by
his
passion
it
seemed
the
shortest
and
clearest
way
toward
a
practical
knowledge
of
the
present
he
said
to
himself
the
investigation
of
existing
relations
between
poor
and
rich
i
shall
gain
more
real
acquaintance
with
english
society
than
by
dawdling
centuries
in
exclusive
the
inquiry
had
not
yet
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
duty
perhaps
so
much
the
better
that
it
might
be
the
more
thoroughly
a
offering
of
love
at
least
it
opened
a
new
field
of
amusement
and
knowledge
it
promised
him
new
studies
of
human
life
and
as
he
lay
on
his
sofa
and
let
his
thoughts
flow
tregarva
dark
revelations
began
to
mix
themselves
with
dreams
about
the
regeneration
of
the
whitford
poor
and
those
again
with
dreams
about
the
heiress
of
whitford
and
many
a
luscious
scene
and
noble
plan
rose
brightly
detailed
in
his
exuberant
imagination
for
lancelot
like
all
born
artists
could
only
think
in
a
concrete
form
he
never
worked
out
a
subject
without
embodying
it
in
some
set
oration
dialogue
or
dramatic
castle
in
the
air
but
the
more
he
dreamt
the
more
he
felt
that
a
material
beauty
of
flesh
and
blood
required
a
material
house
baths
and
boudoirs
conservatories
and
carriages
a
safe
material
purse
and
fixed
material
society
law
and
order
and
the
established
of
society
gained
an
importance
in
his
eyes
which
they
had
never
had
before
he
said
to
himself
am
turning
quite
practical
and
warld
those
old
greeks
were
not
so
far
wrong
when
they
said
that
what
made
men
citizens
patriots
heroes
was
the
love
of
wedded
wife
and
child
wife
and
child
he
shrank
in
from
the
daring
of
the
delicious
thought
as
if
he
had
intruded
without
invitation
into
a
hidden
sanctuary
and
looked
round
for
a
book
to
drive
away
the
dazzling
picture
but
even
there
his
thoughts
were
haunted
by
argemone
face
and
his
regard
was
raised
by
intense
pensiveness
two
eyes
two
starry
eyes
hung
in
the
gloom
of
thought
and
seemed
with
their
serene
and
azure
smiles
to
beckon
him
he
took
up
with
a
new
interest
which
alone
of
all
carlyle
works
he
had
hitherto
disliked
because
his
own
luxurious
had
always
flowed
in
such
sad
discord
with
the
terrible
warnings
of
the
modern
seer
and
his
dark
vistas
of
starvation
crime
neglect
and
discontent
he
said
to
himself
as
he
closed
the
book
suppose
it
is
good
for
us
ones
now
and
then
to
face
the
possibility
of
a
change
gold
has
grown
on
my
back
as
feathers
do
on
geese
without
my
own
will
or
deed
but
considering
that
gold
like
feathers
is
equally
useful
to
those
who
have
and
those
who
have
not
why
it
is
worth
while
for
the
goose
to
remember
that
he
may
possibly
one
day
be
plucked
and
what
remains
io
as
medea
but
argemone
and
lancelot
felt
for
the
moment
as
conservative
as
the
tutelary
genius
of
all
special
constables
as
the
last
thought
passed
through
his
brain
bracebridge
little
mustang
slouched
past
the
window
ridden
without
a
saddle
by
a
horseman
whom
there
was
no
mistaking
for
no
one
but
the
immaculate
colonel
the
chevalier
sans

et
sans
reproche
dared
to
go
about
the
country
a
figure
a
minute
afterwards
he
walked
in
in
a
student
felt
hat
a
ragged
coatee
and
old
white
drills
shrunk
up
his
legs
a
pair
of
embroidered

and
an
enormous
meerschaum
at
his
have
you
been
this
last
week
head
and
ears
in
young
england
till
i
fled
to
you
for
a
week
common
sense
a
glass
of
cider
for
mercy
sake
to
take
the
taste
of
it
out
of
my
mouth
as
bill
sykes
has
it
have
you
been
staying
young
lord
vieuxbois
among
high
art
and
painted
glass
spade
farms
and
model
rubricalities
and
sanitary
reforms
and
all
other
inventions
possible
and
impossible
for
stretching
the
old
formula
to
meet
the
new
fact
as
your
favourite
prophet
says
the
old
formula
cracks
under
the
tension
cracks
its
devotees
too
i
think
here
comes
the
cider
my
dear
fellow
you
must
not
laugh
at
all
this
young
england
or
peelite
this
is
all
right
and
noble
what
a
yet
unspoken
poetry
there
is
in
that
very
sanitary
reform
it
is
the
great
fact
of
the
age
we
shall
have
men
arise
and
write
epics
on
it
when
they
have
learnt
that
to
the
pure
all
things
are
pure
and
that
science
and
usefulness
contain
a
divine
element
even
in
their
lowest
appliances
one
yourself
and
call
it
the
chadwickiad
not
and
the
man
i
sing
there
a
beginning
at
once
why
do
you
rather
with
your
practical
power
turn
sanitary
reformer
the
only
true
soldier
and
conquer
those
real
devils
and
natural
enemies
of
englishmen
carbonic

pas

my
dear
fellow
i
am
miserably
behind
the
age
people
are
getting
so
cursedly
in
earnest
that
i
shall
have
to
bolt
to
the
backwoods
to
amuse
myself
in
peace
or
else
sham
dumb
as
the
monkeys
do
lest
folks
should
find
out

and
set
me
to
work
lancelot
laughed
and
sighed
how
on
earth
do
you
contrive
to
get
on
so
well
with
men
with
whom
you
have
not
an
idea
in
common
faire
o
infant
hercules
own
daddy
to
savoir

i
am
a
good
listener
and
therefore
the
most
perfect
because
the
most
silent
of
flatterers
when
they
talk
puginesquery
i
stick
my
head
on
one
side
attentively
and
think
the
more
like
the
lady
parrot
i
have
been
all
the
morning
looking
over
a
set
of
drawings
for
my
lord
new
chapel
and
every
soul
in
the
party
fancies
me
a
great
antiquary
just
because
i
have
been
retailing
to
b
as
my
own
everything
that
a
told
me
the
moment
before
envy
you
your
tact
at
all
events
the
deuce
should
you
you
may
rise
in
time
to
something
better
than
tact
to
what
the
good
book
i
suppose
means
by
wisdom
young
geniuses
like
you
who
have
been
green
enough
to
sell
your
souls
to
truth
must
not
meddle
with
tact
unless
you
wish
to
fare
as
the
donkey
did
when
he
tried
to
play
all
events
i
would
sooner
remain
cub
till
they
run
me
down
and
eat
me
than
give
up
speaking
my
mind
said
lancelot
i
may
be
but
the
devil
himself
sha
make
me
knave
proper
on
two
thousand
a
year
a
man
can
afford
to
be
honest
kick
out
lustily
right
and
left
after
all
the
world
is
like
a
spaniel
the
more
you
beat
it
the
better
it
likes
you
if
you
have
money
only
do
kick
too
hard
for
after
all
it
has
a
hundred
million
pair
of
shins
to
your
one
fear
that
i
shall
run
against
society
just
now
i
am
too
thoroughly
out
of
my
own
good
books
i
have
been
for
years
laughing
at
young
england
and
yet
its
little
finger
is
thicker
than
my
whole
body
for
it
is
trying
to
do
something
and
i
alas
am
doing
utterly
nothing
i
should
be
really
glad
to
take
a
lesson
of
these
men
and
their
plans
for
social
improvement
will
have
a
fine
opportunity
this
evening
do
you
dine
at
minchampstead
do
you
jingle
dines
everywhere
except
at
home
will
you
take
me
over
in
your
trap
but
whom
shall
we
meet
there
lavingtons
and
vieuxbois
and
vaurien
and
a
parson
or
two
i
suppose
but
between
saint
venus
and
vieuxbois
you
may
soon
learn
enough
to
make
you
a
sadder
man
if
not
a
wiser
one
not
a
wiser
one
sadder
than
now
i
can
not
be
or
less
wise
god
knows
the
colonel
looked
at
lancelot
with
one
of
those
kindly
thoughtful
smiles
which
came
over
him
whenever
his
better
child
heart
could
bubble
up
through
the
thick
crust
of
worldliness
young
friend
you
have
been
a
little
too
much
on
the
stilts
heretofore
take
care
that
now
you
are
off
them
you
do
lie
down
and
sleep
instead
of
walking
honestly
on
your
legs
have
faith
in
yourself
pick
these
men
brains
and
all
men
you
can
do
it
say
to
yourself
boldly
as
the
false
prophet
in
india
said
to
the
missionary
i
have
fire
enough
in
my
stomach
to
burn
up
a
dozen
stucco
and
filigree
reformers
and
assimilate
their
ashes
into
the
bargain
like
one
of
liebig
cabbages
can
i
have
faith
in
myself
when
i
am
playing
traitor
to
myself
every
hour
in
the
day
and
yet
faith
in
something
i
must
have
in
woman
perhaps
said
the
colonel
energetically
anything
but
woman
she
must
be
led
not
leader
if
you
love
a
woman
make
her
have
faith
in
you
if
you
lean
on
her
you
will
ruin
yourself
and
her
as
well
lancelot
shook
his
head
there
was
a
pause
all
colonel
i
think
there
must
be
a
meaning
in
those
old
words
our
mothers
used
to
teach
us
about
having
faith
in
god
the
colonel
shrugged
his
shoulders
sabe
said
the
spanish
girl
when
they
asked
her
who
was
her
child
father
but
here
comes
my
kit
on
a
clod
back
and
it
is
time
to
dress
for
dinner
so
to
the
they
went
lord
minchampstead
was
one
of
the
few
noblemen
lancelot
had
ever
met
who
had
aroused
in
him
a
thorough
feeling
of
respect
he
was
always
and
in
all
things
a
strong
man
naturally
keen
ready
like
daring
he
had
carved
out
his
own
way
through
life
and
opened
his
oyster
the
world
neither
with
sword
nor
pen
but
with
steam
and
cotton
his
father
was
obadiah
newbroom
of
the
manufacturing
firm
of
newbroom
stag
and
playforall
a
stanch
dissenter
himself
he
saw
with
a
slight
pang
his
son
thomas
turn
churchman
as
soon
as
the
young
man
had
worked
his
way
up
to
be
the
real
head
of
the
firm
but
this
was
the
only
sorrow
which
thomas
newbroom
now
lord
minchampstead
had
ever
given
his
father
stood
behind
a
loom
myself
my
boy
when
i
began
life
and
you
must
do
with
great
means
what
i
did
with
little
ones
i
have
made
a
gentleman
of
you
you
must
make
a
nobleman
of
yourself
those
were
almost
the
last
words
of
the
stern
thrifty
old
puritan
craftsman
and
his
son
never
forgot
them
from
a
he
grew
to
owner
shipowner
banker
railway
director
to
kings
and
princes
and
last
of
all
as
the
summit
of
his
own
and
his
compeer
ambition
to
he
had
half
a
dozen
estates
in
as
many
different
counties
he
had
added
house
to
house
and
field
to
field
and
at
last
bought
minchampstead
park
and
ten
thousand
acres
for
its
real
value
from
that
enthusiastic
sportsman
lord
peu
de
cervelle
whose
family
had
come
in
with
the
conqueror
and
gone
out
with
george
iv
so
at
least
they
always
said
but
it
was
remarkable
that
their
name
could
never
be
traced
farther
back
than
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
and
calumnious
dryasdusts
would
sometimes
insolently
father
their
title
on
james
and
one
of
his
batches
of
bought
peerages
but
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
there
was
now
a
new
lord
in
minchampstead
and
every
country
caliban
was
finding
to
his
disgust
that
he
had
a
new
master
and
must
perforce
a
new
man
oh
how
the
squires
swore
and
the
farmers
chuckled
when
the
sold
the
minchampstead
hounds
and
celebrated
his
of
september
by
exterminating
every
hare
and
pheasant
on
the
estate
how
the
farmers
swore
and
the
labourers
chuckled
when
he
took
all
the
cottages
into
his
own
hands
and
rebuilt
them
set
up
a
industrial
school
gave
every
man
a
pig
and
a
garden
and
broke
up
all
the
commons
thin
the
oh
how
the
labourers
swore
and
the
farmers
chuckled
when
he
put
up
on
all
his
farms
refused
to
give
away
a
farthing
in
alms
and
enforced
the
new
to
the
very
letter
how
the
country
tradesmen
swore
when
he
called
them
pack
of
dilatory
jobbers
and
announced
his
intention
of
employing
only
london
workmen
for
his
improvements
oh
how
they
all
swore
together
behind
his
back
of
course
for
his
dinners
were
worth
eating
and
the
very
ladies
said
naughty
words
when
the
stern
political
economist
proclaimed
at
his
own
table
that
had
bought
minchampstead
for
merely
commercial
purposes
as
a
profitable
investment
of
capital
and
he
would
see
that
whatever
else
it
did
it
should
pay
but
the
new
lord
heard
of
all
the
hard
words
with
a
quiet
possessed
smile
he
had
formed
his
narrow
theory
of
the
universe
and
he
was
methodically
and
conscientiously
carrying
it
out
true
too
often
like
poor
keats
merchant
brothers
he
turned
an
easy
wheel
which
set
sharp
racks
at
work
to
pinch
and
peel
but
of
the
harm
which
he
did
he
was
unconscious
in
the
good
which
he
did
he
was
consistent
and
indefatigable
infinitely
superior
with
all
his
defects
to
the
ignorant
extravagant
squire
lavingtons
around
him
at
heart
however
he
was
kindly
and
upright
a
man
of
a
stately
presence
a
broad
honest
face
a
high
square
forehead
bland
and
unwrinkled
i
sketch
him
here
once
for
all
because
i
have
no
part
for
him
after
this
scene
in
my
corps
de
ballet
lord
minchampstead
had
many
reasons
for
patronising
lancelot
in
the
first
place
he
had
a
true
eye
for
a
strong
man
wherever
he
met
him
in
the
next
place
lancelot
uncle
the
banker
was
a
stanch
whig
ally
of
his
in
the
house
the
times
smith
he
once
said
to
lancelot
could
have
made
a
senator
of
you
at
once
but
for
the
sake
of
finality
we
were
forced
to
relinquish
that
organ
of
influence
the
tories
had
abused
it
really
a
little
too
far
and
now
we
can
only
make
a
commissioner
of
you
which
after
all
is
a
more
useful
post
and
a
more
lucrative
one
but
lancelot
had
not
as
yet
as
the
irish
schoolmaster
used
to
call
it
and
cared
very
little
to
play
a
political
ninth
fiddle
the
first
thing
which
caught
his
eyes
as
he
entered
the
before
dinner
was
argemone
listening
in
absorbed
reverence
to
her
favourite
vicar
a
stern
prim
dyspeptic
man
with
a
meek
cold
smile
which
might
have
become
a
cruel
one
he
watched
and
watched
in
vain
hoping
to
catch
her
eye
but
no
there
she
stood
and
talked
and
listened
said
bracebridge
smiling
is
in
vain
smith
when
did
you
know
a
woman
leave
the
church
for
one
of
us
poor
laymen
heavens
said
lancelot
impatiently
will
they
make
such
fools
of
themselves
with
clergymen
are
quite
right
they
always
like
the
strong
men
the
fighters
and
the
workers
in
voltaire
time
they
all
ran
after
the
philosophers
in
the
middle
ages
books
tell
us
they
worshipped
the
knights
errant
they
are
always
on
the
winning
side
the
cunning
little
beauties
in
the
when
the
soldiers
had
to
play
the
world
game
the
ladies
all
caught
the
fever
now
in
these
talking
and
thinking
days
and
be
hanged
to
them
for
bores
they
have
the
fever
for
the
same
reason
the
parsons
are
the
workers
or
rather
all
the
world
expects
them
to
be
so
they
have
the
game
in
their
own
hands
if
they
did
but
know
how
to
play
it
lancelot
stood
still
sulking
over
many
thoughts
the
colonel
lounged
across
the
room
towards
lord
vieuxbois
a
quiet
truly
bred
young
man
with
a
sweet
open
countenance
and
an
ample
forehead
whose
size
would
have
vouched
for
great
talents
had
not
the
promise
been
contradicted
by
the
weakness
of
the
mouth
and
chin
is
that
with
whom
you
came
into
the
room
bracebridge
asked
lord
vieuxbois
am
sure
i
know
his
face
smith
the
man
who
has
taken
the
at
lower
whitford
i
remember
him
well
enough
at
cambridge
he
was
one
of
a
set
who
tried
to
look
like
blackguards
and
really
succeeded
tolerably
they
used
to
eschew
gloves
and
drink
nothing
but
beer
and
smoke
disgusting
short
pipes
and
when
we
established
the
coverley
club
in
trinity
they
set
up
an
opposition
and
called
themselves
the
navvies
and
they
used
to
make
piratical
expeditions
down
to
lynn
in
eight
oars
to
attack
bargemen
and
fen
girls
and
shoot
ducks
and
sleep
under
and
come
home
when
they
had
drank
all
the
taps
dry
i
remember
the
man
perfectly
or
none
said
the
colonel
has
just
the
longest
head
and
the
noblest
heart
of
any
man
i
ever
met
if
he
does
not
distinguish
himself
before
he
dies
i
know
nothing
of
human
nature
yes
i
believe
he
is
clever
enough
took
a
good
degree
a
better
one
than
i
did
but
horribly
eclectic
full
of
mesmerism
and
german
metaphysics
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
heard
of
him
one
night
last
spring
on
which
he
had
been
seen
if
you
will
believe
it
going
successively
into
a
swedenborgian
chapel
the
garrick
head
and
one
of
elliotson
magnetic
soirees
what
can
you
expect
after
that
great
deal
said
bracebridge
drily
such
a
head
as
he
carries
on
his
shoulders
the
man
might
be
another
mirabeau
if
he
held
the
right
cards
in
the
right
rubber
and
he
really
ought
to
suit
you
for
he
raves
about
the
middle
ages
and
chivalry
and
has
edited
a
book
full
of
old
ballads
all
the
eclectics
do
that
sort
of
thing
and
small
thanks
to
them
however
i
will
speak
to
him
after
dinner
and
see
what
there
is
in
him
and
lord
vieuxbois
turned
away
and
alas
for
lancelot
sat
next
to
argemone
at
dinner
lancelot
who
was
cross
with
everybody
for
what
was
nobody
fault
revenged
himself
all
by
never
speaking
a
word
to
his
next
neighbour
miss
newbroom
who
was
longing
with
all
her
heart
to
talk
sentiment
to
him
about
the
exhibition
and
when
argemone
in
the
midst
of
a
brilliant
skirmish
with
lord
vieuxbois
stole
a
glance
at
him
he
chose
to
fancy
that
they
were
both
talking
of
him
and
looked
more
cross
than
ever
after
the
ladies
retired
lancelot
in
his
sulky
way
made
up
his
mind
that
the
conversation
was
going
to
be
ineffably
stupid
and
set
to
to
dream
sip
claret
and
count
the
minutes
till
he
found
himself
in
the
with
argemone
but
he
soon
discovered
as
i
suppose
we
all
have
that
never
rains
but
it
pours
and
that
one
can
not
fall
in
with
a
new
fact
or
a
new
acquaintance
but
next
day
twenty
fresh
things
shall
spring
up
as
if
by
magic
throwing
unexpected
light
on
one
new
phenomenon
lancelot
head
was
full
of
the
question
and
lo
everybody
seemed
destined
to
talk
about
it
lord
vieuxbois
said
the
host
casually
girls
are
raving
about
your
new
school
they
say
it
is
a
perfect
antiquarian
gem
tolerable
i
believe
but
wales
has
disappointed
me
a
little
that
vile
modernist
naturalism
is
creeping
back
even
into
our
painted
glass
i
could
have
wished
that
the
artist
designs
for
the
windows
had
been
a
little
more
catholic
then
asked
the
host
with
a
puzzled
face
he
means
said
bracebridge
the
figures
wrists
and
ankles
were
not
sufficiently
dislocated
and
the
patron
saint
did
not
look
quite
like
a
starved
rabbit
with
its
neck
wrung
some
of
the
faces
i
am
sorry
to
say
were
positively
like
men
and
women
i
understand
said
lord
minchampstead
tongue
is
privileged
you
know
lord
vieuxbois
so
you
must
not
be
angry
do
see
my
way
into
all
this
said
squire
lavington
which
was
very
likely
to
be
true
considering
that
he
never
looked
for
his
way
do
see
how
all
these
painted
windows
and
crosses
and
chanting
and
the
deuce
and
the
pope
only
know
what
else
are
to
make
boys
any
better
have
it
on
the
highest
authority
said
vieuxbois
pictures
and
music
are
the
books
of
the
unlearned
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
any
right
in
the
nineteenth
century
to
contest
an
opinion
which
the
fathers
of
the
church
gave
in
the
fourth
all
events
said
lancelot
is
by
pictures
and
music
by
art
and
song
and
symbolic
representations
that
all
nations
have
been
educated
in
their
adolescence
and
as
the
youth
of
the
individual
is
exactly
analogous
to
the
youth
of
the
collective
race
we
should
employ
the
same
means
of
instruction
with
our
children
which
succeeded
in
the
early
ages
with
the
whole
world
lancelot
might
as
well
have
held
his
tongue
nobody
understood
him
but
vieuxbois
and
he
had
been
taught
to
scent
german
neology
in
everything
as
some
folks
are
taught
to
scent
jesuitry
especially
when
it
involved
an
inductive
law
and
not
a
mere
precedent
and
therefore
could
not
see
that
lancelot
was
arguing
for
him
very
fine
smith
said
the
squire
a
pity
you
wo
leave
off
puzzling
your
head
with
books
and
stick
to
hunting
all
you
young
gentlemen
will
do
is
to
turn
the
heads
of
the
poor
with
your
cursed
education
the
national
oath
followed
of
course
and
chanting
why
when
i
was
a
boy
a
good
honest
labouring
man
wanted
to
see
nothing
better
than
a
halfpenny
ballad
with
a
at
the
top
and
they
worked
very
well
then
and
wanted
for
nothing
we
shall
give
them
the
halfpenny
ballads
in
time
said
vieuxbois
smiling
will
do
a
very
good
deed
then
said
mine
host
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
as
far
as
i
can
find
from
my
agents
when
the
upper
classes
write
cheap
publications
the
lower
classes
will
not
read
them
true
said
vieuxbois
not
the
cause
asked
lancelot
that
the
upper
classes
do
write
them
writings
of
working
men
certainly
said
lord
minchampstead
an
enormous
sale
among
their
own
class
because
they
express
the
feelings
of
that
class
of
which
i
am
beginning
to
fear
that
we
know
very
little
look
again
what
a
noble
literature
of
people
songs
and
hymns
germany
has
some
of
lord
vieuxbois
friends
i
know
are
busy
translating
many
of
them
many
of
them
that
is
to
say
said
vieuxbois
are
compatible
with
a
real
church
spirit
it
so
but
who
wrote
them
not
the
german
aristocracy
for
the
people
but
the
german
people
for
themselves
there
is
the
secret
of
their
power
why
not
educate
the
people
up
to
such
a
standard
that
they
should
be
able
to
write
their
own
literature
said
chalklands
of
chalklands
who
sat
opposite
you
have
working
men
turn
ballad
writers
there
would
be
an
end
of
work
then
i
think
have
not
heard
said
lancelot
the
young
women
ladies
i
ought
to
say
if
the
word
mean
anything
who
wrote
the
lowell
offering
spun
less
or
worse
cotton
than
their
neighbours
the
contrary
said
lord
minchampstead
have
the
most
noble
accounts
of
heroic
industry
and
in
girls
whose
education
to
judge
by
its
fruits
might
shame
that
of
most
english
young
ladies
chalklands
expressed
certain
confused
notions
that
in
america
factory
girls
carried
green
silk
parasols
put
the
legs
of
pianos
into
trousers
and
were
too
prudish
to
make
a
shirt
or
to
call
it
a
shirt
after
it
was
made
he
did
not
quite
remember
which
is
a
great
pity
said
lord
minchampstead
our
factory
girls
are
not
in
the
same
state
of
civilisation
but
it
is
socially
impossible
america
is
in
an
abnormal
state
in
a
young
country
the
laws
of
political
economy
do
not
make
themselves
fully
felt
here
where
we
have
no
uncleared
world
to
drain
the
we
may
pity
and
alleviate
the
condition
of
the
but
we
can
do
nothing
more
all
the
modern
schemes
for
the
amelioration
which
ignore
the
laws
of
competition
must
end
either
in
pauperisation
with
a
glance
at
lord
vieuxbois
in
the
destruction
of
property
lancelot
said
nothing
but
thought
the
more
it
did
strike
him
at
the
moment
that
the
few
might
possibly
be
made
for
the
many
and
not
the
many
for
the
few
and
that
property
was
made
for
man
not
man
for
property
but
he
contented
himself
with
asking
think
then
my
lord
that
in
the
present
state
of
society
no
can
be
given
to
the
condition
in
plain
english
the
wages
of
working
men
without
the
destruction
of
property
lord
minchampstead
smiled
and
parried
the
question
may
be
other
ameliorations
my
young
friend
besides
a
of
wages
so
lancelot
thought
also
but
lord
minchampstead
would
have
been
a
little
startled
could
he
have
seen
lancelot
notion
of
a
lord
minchampstead
was
thinking
of
cheap
bread
and
sugar
do
you
think
that
i
will
tell
you
of
what
lancelot
was
thinking
but
here
vieuxbois
spurred
in
to
break
a
last
lance
he
had
been
very
much
disgusted
with
the
turn
the
conversation
was
taking
for
he
considered
nothing
more
heterodox
than
the
notion
that
the
poor
were
to
educate
themselves
in
his
scheme
of
course
the
clergy
and
the
gentry
were
to
educate
the
poor
who
were
to
take
down
thankfully
as
much
as
it
was
thought
proper
to
give
them
and
all
beyond
was
and
judgment
the
fathers
of
dissent
and
chartism
strikes
and
french
revolutions
et
si
qua
alia
pray
smith
may
i
ask
what
limit
you
would
put
to
education
capacities
of
each
man
said
lancelot
man
living
in
civilised
society
has
one
right
which
he
can
demand
it
is
this
that
the
state
which
exists
by
his
labour
shall
enable
him
to
develop
or
at
least
not
hinder
his
developing
his
whole
faculties
to
their
very
utmost
however
lofty
that
may
be
while
a
man
who
might
be
an
author
remains
a
or
a
journeyman
while
he
has
capacities
for
a
master
while
any
man
able
to
rise
in
life
remains
by
social
circumstances
lower
than
he
is
willing
to
place
himself
that
man
has
a
right
to
complain
of
the
state
injustice
and
neglect
i
do
not
see
said
vieuxbois
people
should
wish
to
rise
in
life
they
had
no
such
fancy
in
the
good
old
times
the
whole
notion
is
a
product
of
these
modern
days
he
would
have
said
more
but
he
luckily
remembered
at
whose
table
he
was
sitting
think
honestly
said
lancelot
whose
blood
was
up
we
gentlemen
all
run
into
the
same
fallacy
we
fancy
ourselves
the
fixed
and
necessary
element
in
society
to
which
all
others
are
to
accommodate
themselves
given
the
rights
of
the
few
rich
to
find
the
condition
of
the
many
poor
it
seems
to
me
that
other
postulate
is
quite
as
fair
given
the
rights
of
the
many
poor
to
find
the
condition
of
the
few
rich
lord
minchampstead
laughed
you
hit
us
so
hard
smith
i
must
really
denounce
you
as
a
communist
lord
vieuxbois
shall
we
join
the
ladies
in
the
poor
lancelot
after
rejecting
overtures
of
fraternity
from
several
young
ladies
set
himself
steadily
again
against
the
wall
to
sulk
and
watch
argemone
but
this
time
she
spied
in
a
few
minutes
his
melancholy
moonstruck
face
swam
up
to
him
and
said
something
kind
and
commonplace
she
spoke
in
the
simplicity
of
her
heart
but
he
chose
to
think
she
was
patronising
him
she
had
not
talked
commonplaces
to
the
vicar
he
tried
to
say
something
smart
and
cutting
stuttered
broke
down
blushed
and
shrank
back
again
to
the
wall
fancying
that
every
eye
in
the
room
was
on
him
and
for
one
moment
a
flash
of
sheer
hatred
to
argemone
swept
through
him
was
argemone
patronising
him
of
course
she
was
true
she
was
but
and
he
was
of
the
same
age
but
spiritually
and
socially
the
girl
develops
ten
years
earlier
than
the
boy
she
was
flattered
and
worshipped
by
men
and
in
her
simplicity
she
thought
it
a
noble
to
stoop
to
notice
the
poor
awkward
youth
and
yet
if
he
could
have
seen
the
pure
moonlight
of
sisterly
pity
which
filled
all
her
heart
as
she
retreated
with
something
of
a
blush
and
something
of
a
sigh
and
her
heart
fluttered
and
fell
would
he
have
been
content
not
he
it
was
her
love
he
wanted
and
not
her
pity
it
was
to
conquer
her
and
possess
her
and
inform
himself
with
her
image
and
her
with
his
own
though
as
yet
he
did
not
know
it
though
the
moment
that
she
turned
away
he
cursed
himself
for
selfish
vanity
and
moroseness
and
conceit
am
i
to
demand
her
all
to
myself
her
the
glorious
the
saintly
the
unfallen
is
not
a
look
a
word
infinitely
more
than
i
deserve
and
yet
i
pretend
to
admire
tales
of
chivalry
old
knightly
hearts
would
have
fought
and
wandered
for
years
to
earn
a
tithe
of
the
favours
which
have
been
bestowed
on
me
unasked
peace
poor
lancelot
thy
egg
is
by
no
means
addle
but
the
chick
is
breaking
the
shell
in
somewhat
a
fashion
chapter
vii
the
drive
home
and
what
came
of
it
now
it
was
not
extraordinary
that
squire
lavington
had
a
couple
of
bottles
of
carbonel
best
port
for
however
abstemious
the
new
lord
himself
might
be
he
felt
for
the
habits
and
for
the
vote
of
an
whig
squire
nor
was
it
extraordinary
that
he
fell
fast
asleep
the
moment
he
got
into
the
carriage
nor
again
that
his
wife
and
daughters
were
not
solicitous
about
waking
him
nor
on
the
other
hand
that
the
coachman
and
footman
who
were
like
all
the
squire
servants
of
the
good
old
sort
honest
faithful
boozing
extravagant
souls
who
had
about
the
place
these
forty
years
were
somewhat
owlish
and
unsteady
on
the
box
nor
was
it
extraordinary
that
there
was
a
heavy
storm
of
lightning
for
that
happened
three
times
in
the
chalk
hills
the
summer
through
nor
again
that
under
these
circumstances
the
horses
who
were
of
the
squire
own
breeding
and
never
thoroughly
broke
nothing
was
done
thoroughly
at
whitford
went
rather
wildly
home
and
that
the
carriage
swung
alarmingly
down
the
steep
hills
and
the
boughs
brushed
the
windows
rather
too
often
but
it
was
extraordinary
that
lavington
had
cast
off
her
usual
primness
and
seemed
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
in
an
exuberant
good
humour
which
she
evinced
by
snubbing
her
usual
favourite
honoria
and
lavishing
caresses
on
argemone
whose
vagaries
she
usually
regarded
with
a
sort
of
puzzled
terror
like
a
hen
who
has
hatched
a
duckling
take
your
feet
off
my
dress
argemone
my
child
i
hope
you
spent
a
pleasant
evening
argemone
answered
by
some
tossy
commonplace
a
pause
and
then
lavington
recommenced
very
pleasing
that
poor
young
lord
vieuxbois
is
after
all
thought
you
disliked
him
so
much
opinions
my
child
but
we
must
hope
for
the
best
he
seems
moral
and
well
inclined
and
really
desirous
of
doing
good
in
his
way
and
so
successful
in
the
house
too
i
hear
me
said
argemone
seems
to
want
life
originality
depth
everything
that
makes
a
great
man
he
knows
nothing
but
what
he
has
picked
up
from
books
after
all
his
opinions
are
the
one
redeeming
point
in
him
my
dear
when
it
pleases
heaven
to
open
your
eyes
you
will
see
as
i
do
poor
lavington
unconscious
spokeswoman
for
the
hundredths
of
the
human
race
what
are
we
all
doing
from
morning
to
night
but
setting
up
our
own
fancies
as
the
measure
of
all
heaven
and
earth
and
saying
each
in
his
own
dialect
whig
radical
or
tory
papist
or
protestant
it
pleases
heaven
to
open
your
eyes
you
will
see
as
i
do
is
a
great
pity
went
on
lavington
meditatively
see
a
young
man
so
benighted
and
thrown
away
with
his
vast
fortune
too
such
a
means
of
good
really
we
ought
to
have
seen
a
little
more
of
him
i
think
conversation
might
be
a
blessing
to
him
i
think
of
asking
him
over
to
stay
a
week
at
whitford
to
meet
that
sainted
young
man
now
argemone
did
not
think
the
reverend
panurgus
incumbent
of
lower
whitford
at
all
a
sainted
young
man
but
on
the
contrary
a
very
vulgar
slippery
irishman
and
she
had
somehow
tired
of
her
late
favourite
lord
vieuxbois
so
she
answered
tossily
enough
mamma
a
week
of
lord
vieuxbois
will
be
too
much
we
shall
be
bored
to
death
with
the
cambridge
camden
society
and
ballads
for
the
people
think
my
dear
said
lavington
who
had
half
unconsciously
to
herself
more
reasons
than
one
for
bringing
the
young
lord
to
whitford
think
my
dear
that
his
conversation
with
all
its
faults
will
be
a
very
improving
change
for
your
father
i
hope
he
asleep
the
squire
nose
answered
for
itself
what
between
smith
and
colonel
bracebridge
and
their
very
ineligible
friend
mellot
whom
i
should
never
have
allowed
to
enter
my
house
if
i
had
suspected
his
religious
views
the
place
has
become
a
hotbed
of
false
doctrine
and
heresy
i
have
been
quite
frightened
when
i
have
heard
their
conversation
at
dinner
lest
the
footmen
should
turn
infidels
mamma
said
honoria
slyly
vieuxbois
might
convert
them
to
something
quite
as
bad
how
shocking
if
old
giles
the
butler
should
turn
papist
you
are
very
silly
lord
vieuxbois
at
least
can
be
trusted
he
has
no
liking
for
low
companions
he
is
above
joking
with
grooms
and
taking
country
walks
with
gamekeepers
it
was
lucky
that
it
was
dark
for
honoria
and
argemone
both
blushed
crimson
poor
father
mind
has
been
quite
unsettled
by
all
their
ribaldry
they
have
kept
him
so
continually
amused
that
all
my
efforts
to
bring
him
to
a
sense
of
his
awful
state
have
been
more
unavailing
than
ever
poor
lavington
she
had
married
at
eighteen
a
man
far
her
inferior
in
intellect
and
had
become
as
often
happens
in
such
cases
a
prude
and
a
devotee
the
squire
who
really
admired
and
respected
her
confined
his
disgust
to
sly
curses
at
the
methodists
under
which
name
he
used
to
include
every
species
of
religious
earnestness
from
quakerism
to
that
of
newman
lavington
used
at
first
to
dignify
these
disagreeables
by
the
name
of
persecution
and
now
she
was
trying
to
convert
the
old
man
by
coldness
severity
and
long
utterly
unintelligible
to
their
victim
because
couched
in
the
peculiar
conventional
phraseology
of
a
certain
school
she
forgot
poor
earnest
soul
that
the
same
form
of
religion
which
had
captivated
a
disappointed
girl
of
twenty
might
not
be
the
most
attractive
one
for
a
jovial
old
man
of
sixty
argemone
who
a
fortnight
before
would
have
chimed
in
with
all
her
mother
lamentations
now
felt
a
little
nettled
and
jealous
she
could
not
bear
to
hear
lancelot
classed
with
the
colonel
she
said
amusement
is
bad
for
my
father
he
is
not
likely
to
get
much
of
it
during
lord
vieuxbois
stay
but
of
course
mamma
you
will
do
as
you
please
course
i
shall
my
dear
answered
the
good
lady
in
a
queen
tone
shall
only
take
the
liberty
of
adding
that
it
is
very
painful
to
me
to
find
you
adding
to
the
anxiety
which
your
unfortunate
opinions
give
me
by
throwing
every
possible
obstacle
in
the
way
of
my
plans
for
your
good
argemone
burst
into
proud
tears
she
often
did
so
after
a
conversation
with
her
mother
for
my
good
and
an
unworthy
suspicion
about
her
mother
crossed
her
mind
and
was
peremptorily
expelled
again
what
turn
the
conversation
would
have
taken
next
i
know
not
but
at
that
moment
honoria
and
her
mother
uttered
a
fearful
shriek
as
their
side
of
the
carriage
jolted
way
up
the
bank
and
stuck
still
in
that
pleasant
position
the
squire
awoke
and
the
ladies
simultaneously
clapped
their
hands
to
their
ears
knowing
what
was
coming
he
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
discharged
a
broadside
of
at
least
ten
pounds
worth
of
oaths
bow
street
valuation
at
the
servants
who
were
examining
the
broken
wheel
with
a
side
volley
or
two
at
lavington
for
being
frightened
he
often
treated
her
and
honoria
to
that
style
of
oratory
at
argemone
he
had
never
sworn
but
once
since
she
left
the
nursery
and
was
so
frightened
at
the
consequences
that
he
took
care
never
to
do
it
again
but
there
they
were
fast
with
a
broken
wheel
plunging
horses
and
a
drunken
coachman
luckily
for
them
the
colonel
and
lancelot
were
following
close
behind
and
came
to
their
assistance
the
colonel
as
usual
solved
the
problem
will
carry
four
smith
will
let
the
ladies
get
in
and
lavington
drive
them
home
said
the
squire
both
my
hands
with
the
gout
you
must
drive
three
of
us
colonel
and
one
of
us
must
walk
will
walk
said
argemone
in
her
determined
way
lavington
began
something
about
propriety
but
was
stopped
with
another
pound
worth
of
oaths
by
the
squire
who
however
had
tolerably
recovered
his
good
humour
and
hurried
lavington
and
honoria
laughingly
into
the
saying
safe
enough
with
smith
the
servants
will
lead
the
horses
behind
them
it
only
three
miles
home
and
i
should
like
to
see
any
one
speak
to
her
twice
while
smith
fists
are
in
the
way
lancelot
thought
so
too
can
trust
yourself
to
me
miss
lavington
all
means
i
shall
enjoy
the
walk
after
and
she
stopped
in
a
moment
the
had
rattled
off
with
a
parting
curse
from
the
squire
to
the
servants
who
were
unharnessing
the
horses
argemone
took
lancelot
arm
the
soft
touch
thrilled
through
and
through
him
and
argemone
felt
she
knew
not
why
a
new
sensation
run
through
her
frame
she
shuddered
not
with
pain
are
cold
miss
lavington
not
in
the
least
cold
when
every
vein
was
boiling
so
strangely
a
soft
luscious
melancholy
crept
over
her
she
had
always
had
a
terror
of
darkness
but
now
she
felt
quite
safe
in
his
strength
the
thought
of
her
own
unprotected
girlhood
drew
her
heart
closer
to
him
she
remembered
with
pleasure
the
stories
of
his
personal
prowess
which
had
once
made
her
think
him
coarse
and
brutal
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
knew
the
delight
of
dependence
the
holy
charm
of
weakness
and
as
they
paced
on
silently
together
through
the
black
awful
night
while
the
servants
lingered
far
out
of
sight
about
the
horses
she
found
out
how
utterly
she
trusted
to
him
she
said
a
nightingale
was
close
to
them
pouring
out
his
whole
soul
in
song
it
not
very
late
in
the
year
for
a
nightingale
is
waiting
for
his
mate
she
is
rearing
a
late
brood
i
suppose
do
you
think
it
is
which
can
stir
him
up
to
such
an
ecstasy
of
joy
and
transfigure
his
whole
heart
into
melody
but
love
the
fulness
of
all
joy
the
evoker
of
all
song
song
the
angels
sing
in
heaven
they
say
but
the
angels
must
love
if
they
sing
love
god
no
one
else
yes
but
that
is
universal
spiritual
love
not
earthly
love
a
narrow
passion
for
an
individual
do
we
know
that
they
do
not
learn
to
love
all
by
first
loving
one
the
angelic
life
is
single
told
you
so
miss
lavington
she
quoted
the
stock
text
of
course
in
heaven
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
but
are
as
the
angels
as
the
tree
falls
so
it
lies
and
god
forbid
that
those
who
have
been
true
lovers
on
earth
should
contract
new
marriages
in
the
next
world
love
is
eternal
death
may
part
lovers
but
not
love
and
how
do
we
know
that
these
angels
as
they
call
them
if
they
be
really
persons
may
not
be
united
in
pairs
by
some
marriage
bond
infinitely
more
perfect
than
any
we
can
dream
of
on
earth
is
a
very
wild
view
smith
and
not
sanctioned
by
the
church
said
argemone
severely
curious
and
significant
it
is
how
severe
ladies
are
apt
to
be
whenever
they
talk
of
the
church
plain
historic
fact
the
early
fathers
and
the
monks
did
not
sanction
it
and
are
not
they
the
very
last
persons
to
whom
one
would
go
to
be
taught
about
marriage
strange
that
people
should
take
their
notions
of
love
from
the
very
men
who
prided
themselves
on
being
bound
by
their
own
vows
to
know
nothing
about
it
were
very
holy
men
still
men
as
i
take
it
and
do
you
not
see
that
love
is
like
all
spiritual
things
only
to
be
understood
by
experience
by
loving
is
love
spiritual
me
but
what
a
question
for
one
who
believes
that
god
is
love
the
divines
tell
us
that
the
love
of
human
beings
is
earthly
did
they
know
they
had
never
tried
oh
miss
lavington
can
not
you
see
that
in
those
barbarous
and
profligate
ages
of
the
later
empire
it
was
impossible
for
men
to
discern
the
spiritual
beauty
of
marriage
degraded
as
it
had
been
by
heathen
brutality
do
you
not
see
that
there
must
have
been
a
continual
tendency
in
the
minds
of
a
celibate
clergy
to
look
with
contempt
almost
with
spite
on
pleasures
which
were
forbidden
to
them
another
pause
must
be
very
delicious
said
argemone
thoughtfully
any
one
who
believes
it
to
think
that
marriage
can
last
through
eternity
but
then
what
becomes
of
entire
love
to
god
how
can
we
part
our
hearts
between
him
and
his
creatures
is
a
sin
then
to
love
your
sister
or
your
friend
what
a
low
material
view
of
love
to
fancy
that
you
can
cut
it
up
into
so
many
pieces
like
a
cake
and
give
to
one
person
one
and
another
to
another
as
the
popish
books
would
have
you
believe
love
is
like
flame
light
as
many
fresh
flames
at
it
as
you
will
it
grows
instead
of
diminishing
by
the
dispersion
is
a
beautiful
imagination
oh
how
miserable
and
tantalising
a
thought
miss
lavington
to
those
who
know
that
a
priceless
spirit
is
near
them
which
might
be
one
with
theirs
through
all
eternity
like
twin
stars
in
one
common
atmosphere
for
ever
giving
and
receiving
wisdom
and
might
beauty
and
bliss
and
yet
are
barred
from
their
bliss
by
some
invisible
adamantine
wall
against
which
they
must
beat
themselves
to
death
like
butterflies
against
the
gazing
and
longing
and
unable
to
guess
why
they
are
forbidden
to
enjoy
why
did
argemone
withdraw
her
arm
from
his
he
knew
and
he
felt
that
she
was
entrusted
to
him
he
turned
away
from
the
subject
wonder
whether
they
are
safe
home
by
this
time
hope
my
father
will
not
catch
cold
how
sad
smith
that
he
will
swear
so
i
do
not
like
to
say
it
and
yet
you
must
have
heard
him
too
often
yourself
is
hardly
a
sin
with
him
now
i
think
he
has
become
so
habituated
to
it
that
he
attaches
no
meaning
or
notion
whatsoever
to
his
own
oaths
i
have
heard
him
do
it
with
a
smiling
face
to
the
very
beggar
to
whom
he
was
giving
we
must
not
judge
a
man
of
his
school
by
the
standard
of
our
own
day
us
hope
so
said
argemone
sadly
there
was
another
pause
at
a
turn
of
the
hill
road
the
black
masses
of
opened
and
showed
the
priory
lights
twinkling
right
below
strange
that
argemone
felt
sorry
to
find
herself
so
near
home
shall
go
to
town
next
week
said
she
and
then
you
are
going
to
norway
this
summer
are
you
not
i
have
learnt
that
my
duty
lies
nearer
home
are
you
going
to
do
wish
this
summer
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
to
try
and
do
some
good
to
examine
a
little
into
the
real
condition
of
english
working
men
am
afraid
smith
that
i
did
not
teach
you
that
duty
you
have
taught
me
priceless
things
you
have
taught
me
beauty
is
the
sacrament
of
heaven
and
love
its
gate
that
that
which
is
the
most
luscious
is
also
the
most
pure
i
never
spoke
a
word
to
you
on
such
subjects
are
those
miss
lavington
to
whom
a
human
face
can
speak
truths
too
deep
for
books
argemone
was
silent
but
she
understood
him
why
did
she
not
withdraw
her
arm
a
second
time
in
a
moment
more
the
colonel
hailed
them
from
the
and
behind
him
came
the
britschka
with
a
relay
of
servants
they
parted
with
a
long
lingering
pressure
of
the
hand
which
haunted
her
young
palm
all
night
in
dreams
argemone
got
into
the
carriage
lancelot
jumped
into
the
took
the
reins
and
relieved
his
heart
by
galloping
sandy
up
the
hill
and
frightening
the
returning
coachman
down
one
bank
and
his
led
horses
up
the
other
la
galere
lancelot
i
hope
you
have
made
good
use
of
your
time
but
lancelot
spoke
no
word
all
the
way
home
and
wandered
till
dawn
in
the
woods
around
his
cottage
kissing
the
hand
which
argemone
palm
had
pressed
chapter
viii
whither
some
three
months
slipped
away
right
dreary
months
for
lancelot
for
the
lavingtons
went
to
for
the
summer
waters
were
necessary
for
their
how
wonderful
it
is
by
the
bye
that
those
german
brunnen
are
never
necessary
for
poor
people
health
and
they
did
not
return
till
the
end
of
august
so
lancelot
buried
himself
up
to
the
eyes
in
the
question
that
is
in
blue
books
red
books
sanitary
reports
mine
reports
factory
reports
and
came
to
the
conclusion
which
is
now
pretty
generally
entertained
that
something
was
the
matter
but
what
no
man
knew
or
if
they
knew
thought
proper
to
declare
hopeless
and
bewildered
he
left
the
books
and
wandered
day
after
day
from
farm
to
hamlet
and
from
field
to
tramper
tent
in
hopes
of
finding
out
the
secret
for
himself
what
he
saw
of
course
i
must
not
say
for
if
i
did
the
reviewers
would
declare
as
usual
one
and
all
that
i
copied
out
of
the
morning
chronicle
and
the
fact
that
these
pages
hundredths
of
them
at
least
were
written
two
years
before
the
morning
chronicle
began
its
invaluable
investigations
would
be
contemptuously
put
aside
as
at
once
impossible
and
arrogant
i
shall
therefore
only
say
that
he
saw
what
every
one
else
has
seen
at
least
heard
of
and
got
tired
of
hearing
though
alas
they
have
not
got
tired
of
seeing
it
and
so
proceed
with
my
story
only
mentioning
therein
certain
particulars
which
folks
seem
to
me
somewhat
strangely
to
have
generally
overlooked
but
whatever
lancelot
saw
or
thought
he
saw
i
can
not
say
that
it
brought
him
any
nearer
to
a
solution
of
the
question
and
he
at
last
ended
by
a
sulky
acquiescence
in
sam
weller
memorable
dictum
it
is
i
ca
say
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
somebody
ought
to
be
wopped
for
this
but
one
day
turning
over
as
hopelessly
as
he
was
beginning
to
turn
over
everything
else
a
new
work
of
carlyle
he
fell
on
some
such
words
as
these
beginning
and
the
end
of
what
is
the
matter
with
us
in
these
days
is
that
we
have
forgotten
god
forgotten
god
that
was
at
least
a
defect
of
which
blue
books
had
taken
no
note
and
it
was
one
which
on
the
whole
granting
for
the
sake
of
argument
any
real
living
or
practical
existence
to
that
being
might
be
a
radical
one
it
brought
him
many
hours
of
thought
that
saying
and
when
they
were
over
he
rose
up
and
went
to
find
tregarva
he
is
the
man
he
is
the
only
man
with
whom
i
have
ever
met
of
whom
i
could
be
sure
that
independent
of
his
own
interest
without
the
allurements
of
respectability
and
decency
of
habit
and
custom
he
believes
in
god
and
he
too
is
a
poor
man
he
has
known
the
struggles
temptations
sorrows
of
the
poor
i
will
go
to
him
but
as
lancelot
rose
to
find
him
there
was
put
into
his
hand
a
letter
which
kept
him
at
home
a
while
longer
none
other
in
fact
than
the
answer
from
luke
my
dear
cousin
you
may
possibly
have
some
logical
ground
from
which
to
deny
popery
if
you
deny
all
other
religions
with
it
but
how
those
who
hold
any
received
form
of
christianity
whatsoever
can
fairly
side
with
you
against
rome
i
can
not
see
i
am
sure
i
have
been
sent
to
rome
by
them
not
drawn
thither
by
jesuits
not
merely
by
their
defects
and
inconsistencies
not
merely
because
they
go
on
taunting
us
and
shrieking
at
us
with
the
cry
that
we
ought
to
go
to
rome
till
we
at
last
wearied
out
take
them
at
their
word
and
do
at
their
bidding
the
thing
we
used
to
shrink
from
with
terror
not
this
merely
but
the
very
doctrines
we
hold
in
common
with
them
have
sent
me
to
rome
for
would
these
men
have
known
of
them
if
rome
had
not
been
the
trinity
the
atonement
the
inspiration
of
a
future
state
that
point
on
which
the
present
generation
without
a
smattering
of
psychological
science
without
even
the
old
belief
in
apparitions
dogmatises
so
narrowly
and
arrogantly
what
would
they
have
known
of
them
but
for
rome
and
she
says
there
are
three
realms
in
the
future
state
heaven
hell
and
purgatory
what
right
have
they
to
throw
away
the
latter
and
arbitrarily
retain
the
two
former
i
am
told
that
scripture
gives
no
warrant
for
a
third
state
she
says
that
it
does
that
it
teaches
that
implicitly
as
it
teaches
other
the
very
highest
doctrines
some
hold
the
trinity
it
may
be
proved
from
scripture
for
it
may
be
proved
from
the
love
and
justice
of
god
revealed
in
scripture
the
protestants
divide
in
theory
that
is
mankind
into
two
classes
the
righteous
who
are
destined
to
infinite
bliss
the
wicked
who
are
doomed
to
infinite
torment
in
which
latter
class
to
make
their
arbitrary
division
exhaustive
they
put
of
course
nine
hundred
and
out
of
the
thousand
and
doom
to
everlasting
companionship
with
borgias
and
cagliostros
the
gentle
frivolous
girl
or
the
peevish
boy
who
would
have
shrunk
in
life
with
horror
from
the
well
at
least
their
hell
is
hellish
enough
if
it
were
but
but
i
lancelot
i
can
not
believe
it
i
will
not
believe
it
i
had
a
brother
once
affectionate
simple
generous
full
of
noble
aspirations
but
without
alas
a
thought
of
god
yielding
in
a
hundred
little
points
and
some
great
ones
to
the
infernal
temptations
of
a
public
he
died
at
seventeen
where
is
he
now
lancelot
where
is
he
now
never
for
a
day
has
that
thought
left
my
mind
for
years
not
in
heaven
for
he
has
no
right
there
protestants
would
say
that
as
well
as
where
then
lancelot
not
in
that
other
place
i
can
not
i
will
not
believe
it
for
the
sake
of
god
honour
as
well
as
of
my
own
sanity
i
will
not
believe
it
there
must
be
some
third
place
some
intermediate
chance
some
door
of
hope
some
purifying
and
redeeming
process
beyond
the
why
not
a
purifying
fire
ages
of
that
are
surely
punishment
enough
and
if
there
be
a
fire
of
hell
why
not
a
fire
of
purgatory
after
all
the
idea
of
purgatory
as
a
fire
is
only
an
opinion
not
a
dogma
of
the
but
if
the
gross
flesh
which
has
sinned
is
to
be
punished
by
the
matter
which
it
has
abused
why
may
it
not
be
purified
by
it
may
laugh
if
you
will
at
both
and
say
again
as
i
have
heard
you
say
ere
now
that
the
popular
christian
paradise
and
hell
are
but
a
pagan
olympus
and
tartarus
as
grossly
material
as
mahomet
without
the
honest
sexuality
which
you
thought
made
his
notion
logical
and
well
you
may
say
that
but
protestants
can
not
for
their
idea
of
heaven
and
ours
is
the
same
with
this
exception
that
theirs
will
contain
but
a
thin
band
of
saved
ones
while
ours
will
fill
and
grow
to
all
i
tell
you
lancelot
it
is
just
the
very
doctrines
for
which
england
most
curses
rome
and
this
very
purgatory
at
the
head
of
them
which
constitute
her
strength
and
her
allurement
which
appeal
to
the
reason
the
conscience
the
heart
of
men
like
me
who
have
revolted
from
the
novel
superstition
which
looks
pitilessly
on
at
the
fond
memories
of
the
brother
the
prayers
of
the
orphan
the
doubled
desolation
of
the
widow
with
its
cold
terrible
assurance
there
is
no
hope
for
thy
loved
and
lost
ones
no
hope
but
hell
for
evermore
do
not
expect
to
convert
you
you
have
your
metempsychosis
and
your
theories
of
progressive
incarnation
and
your
monads
and
your
spirits
of
the
stars
and
flowers
i
have
not
forgotten
a
certain
talk
of
ours
over
falk
von
muller
recollections
of
goethe
and
how
you
materialists
are
often
the
most
fantastic
of
i
do
not
expect
i
say
to
convert
you
i
only
want
to
show
you
there
is
no
use
trying
to
show
the
pharisees
of
the
popular
sect
why
in
spite
of
all
their
curses
men
still
go
back
to
rome
lancelot
read
this
and
it
and
smiled
but
sadly
and
the
more
he
read
the
stronger
its
arguments
seemed
to
him
and
he
rejoiced
thereat
for
there
is
a
bad
pleasure
happy
he
who
has
not
felt
it
in
a
pitiless
reductio
ad
absurdum
which
asks
tauntingly
do
you
not
follow
out
your
own
conclusions
instead
of
thanking
god
that
people
do
not
follow
them
out
and
that
their
hearts
are
sounder
than
their
heads
was
it
with
this
feeling
that
the
fancy
took
possession
of
him
to
show
the
letter
to
tregarva
i
hope
not
perhaps
he
did
not
altogether
wish
to
lead
him
into
temptation
any
more
than
i
wish
to
lead
my
readers
but
only
to
make
him
just
as
i
wish
to
make
them
face
manfully
a
real
awful
question
now
racking
the
hearts
of
hundreds
and
see
how
they
will
be
able
to
answer
the
sophist
fiend
for
honestly
such
he
is
when
their
time
comes
as
come
it
will
at
least
he
wanted
to
test
at
once
tregarva
knowledge
and
his
logic
as
for
his
alas
he
had
not
so
much
reverence
for
it
as
to
care
what
effect
luke
arguments
might
have
there
whole
man
quoth
lancelot
to
himself
a
novel
phenomenon
and
all
phenomena
however
magnificent
are
surely
fair
subjects
for
experiment
magendie
may
have
gone
too
far
certainly
in
dissecting
a
live
dog
but
what
harm
in
my
pulling
the
mane
of
a
dead
lion
so
he
showed
the
letter
to
tregarva
as
they
were
fishing
together
one
day
for
lancelot
had
been
installed
duly
in
the
whitford
trout
preserves
tregarva
read
it
slowly
asked
shrewdly
enough
the
meaning
of
a
word
or
two
as
he
went
on
at
last
folded
it
up
deliberately
and
returned
it
to
its
owner
with
a
deep
sigh
lancelot
said
nothing
for
a
few
minutes
but
the
giant
seemed
so
little
inclined
to
open
the
conversation
that
he
was
forced
at
last
to
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
it
is
a
matter
for
thinking
sir
to
my
mind
there
a
nice
fish
on
the
feed
there
just
that
alder
the
fish
why
not
a
matter
for
thinking
my
mind
sir
a
man
may
think
a
deal
too
much
about
many
matters
that
come
in
his
way
should
he
do
with
them
then
his
own
business
for
those
whom
they
concern
that
rather
a
speech
for
you
tregarva
the
cornishman
looked
up
at
him
earnestly
his
eyes
were
glittering
was
it
with
tears
fancy
i
do
feel
for
the
poor
young
gentleman
god
help
him
i
been
through
it
all
or
not
through
it
that
to
say
i
had
a
brother
once
as
fine
a
young
fellow
as
ever
handled
pick
as
as
a
woman
and
as
honest
as
the
sun
in
but
he
would
drink
sir
that
one
temptation
he
never
could
stand
it
and
one
day
at
the
shaft
mouth
reaching
after
the
maybe
he
was
in
liquor
maybe
not
the
lord
knows
but
did
know
him
again
sir
when
we
picked
him
up
any
more
and
the
strong
man
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
and
beat
impatiently
on
the
ground
with
his
heavy
heel
as
if
to
crush
down
the
rising
horror
is
he
sir
a
long
pause
you
think
i
did
ask
that
sir
for
years
and
years
after
of
god
and
my
own
soul
and
heaven
and
earth
and
the
things
under
the
earth
too
for
many
a
night
did
i
go
down
that
mine
out
of
my
turn
and
sat
for
hours
in
that
level
watching
and
watching
if
perhaps
the
spirit
of
him
might
haunt
about
and
tell
his
poor
brother
one
word
of
news
one
way
or
the
other
anything
would
have
been
a
comfort
but
the
doubt
i
could
bear
and
yet
at
last
i
learnt
to
bear
it
and
what
more
i
learnt
not
to
care
for
it
it
a
bold
word
there
one
who
knows
whether
or
not
it
is
a
true
one
heavens
and
what
then
did
you
say
to
yourself
said
this
sir
or
rather
one
came
as
i
was
on
my
knees
and
said
it
to
me
what
done
you
ca
mend
what
left
you
can
whatever
has
happened
is
god
concern
now
and
none
but
his
do
you
see
that
as
far
as
you
can
no
such
thing
ever
happen
again
on
the
face
of
his
earth
and
from
that
day
sir
i
gave
myself
up
to
that
one
thing
and
will
until
i
die
to
save
the
poor
young
fellows
like
myself
who
are
left
to
the
devil
body
and
soul
just
when
they
are
in
the
prime
of
their
power
to
work
for
god
said
lancelot
poor
luke
spirit
were
but
as
strong
as
yours
strong
answered
he
with
a
sad
smile
so
you
think
sir
but
it
written
and
it
true
the
heart
knoweth
its
own
bitterness
you
absolutely
refuse
to
try
to
fancy
your
his
present
state
sir
because
if
i
did
fancy
it
that
would
be
a
certain
sign
i
did
know
it
if
we
ca
conceive
what
god
has
prepared
for
those
that
we
know
loved
him
how
much
less
can
we
for
them
of
whom
we
do
know
whether
they
loved
him
or
not
thought
lancelot
to
himself
did
not
do
so
very
wrong
in
trusting
your
intellect
to
cut
through
a
sophism
what
do
you
believe
tregarva
believe
this
sir
and
your
cousin
will
believe
the
same
if
he
will
only
give
up
as
i
am
sore
afraid
he
will
need
to
some
day
sticking
to
arguments
and
doctrines
about
the
lord
and
love
and
trust
the
lord
himself
i
believe
sir
that
the
judge
of
all
the
earth
will
do
right
and
what
right
ca
be
wrong
nor
cruel
either
else
it
would
not
be
like
him
who
loved
us
to
the
death
that
all
i
know
and
that
enough
for
me
to
whom
little
is
given
of
him
is
little
required
he
that
did
know
his
master
will
will
be
beaten
with
few
stripes
and
he
that
did
know
it
as
i
do
will
be
beaten
with
many
if
he
neglects
it
and
that
latter
not
the
former
is
my
concern
thought
lancelot
to
himself
great
heart
has
gone
down
to
the
root
of
the
matter
the
right
and
wrong
of
it
he
at
least
has
not
forgotten
god
well
i
would
give
up
all
the
teleologies
and
cosmogonies
that
i
ever
dreamt
or
read
just
to
believe
what
he
believes
heigho
and
paul
hist
i
swear
that
was
an
otter
hope
not
sir
i
sure
i
have
seen
the
spraint
of
one
here
this
two
years
again
do
you
see
something
move
under
that
marl
bank
tregarva
watched
a
moment
and
then
ran
up
to
the
spot
and
throwing
himself
on
his
face
on
the
edge
leant
over
grappled
something
and
was
instantly
to
lancelot
astonishment
grappled
in
his
turn
by
a
rough
lank
white
dog
whose
teeth
however
could
not
get
through
the
velveteen
sleeve
give
in
keeper
i
give
in
doa
ye
harm
the
dog
he
deaf
as
a
post
you
knows
wo
harm
him
if
you
take
him
off
and
come
up
quietly
this
mysterious
conversation
was
carried
on
with
a
human
head
which
peeped
above
the
water
its
arms
supporting
from
beneath
the
growling
cur
such
a
visage
as
only
poachers
or
trampling
drovers
or
london
chiffonniers
carry
and
retreating
to
a
narrow
peak
above
while
below
the
bleared
cheeks
and
drooping
lips
and
peering
purblind
eyes
perplexed
hopeless
defiant
and
yet
sneaking
bespeak
their
share
in
the
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
savages
without
the
resources
of
a
savage
slaves
without
the
protection
of
a
master
to
whom
the
and
the
would
be
a
change
for
the
better
for
there
at
least
is
food
and
shelter
slowly
and
distrustfully
a
dripping
scarecrow
of
rags
and
bones
rose
from
his
in
the
water
and
then
stopped
suddenly
and
seemed
inclined
to
dash
through
the
river
but
tregarva
held
him
fast
two
on
ye
that
a
shame
i
surrender
to
no
man
but
you
paul
hold
off
or
i
set
the
dog
on
ye
a
gentleman
fishing
he
wo
tell
will
you
sir
and
he
turned
to
lancelot
pity
on
the
poor
creature
sir
for
god
sake
it
is
often
he
gets
it
wo
tell
my
man
i
not
seen
you
doing
any
harm
come
out
like
a
man
and
let
have
a
look
at
you
the
creature
crawled
up
the
bank
and
stood
abject
and
shivering
with
the
dog
growling
from
between
his
legs
was
only
looking
for
a
kingfisher
nest
indeed
now
i
was
paul
tregarva
lie
you
were
setting
i
saw
a
minnow
lie
on
the
bank
as
i
came
up
do
lie
i
hate
liars
indeed
then
a
man
must
live
somehow
do
seem
to
live
by
this
trade
my
friend
quoth
lancelot
can
not
say
it
seems
a
prosperous
business
by
the
look
of
your
coat
and
trousers
tim
goddard
stole
all
my
clothes
and
no
good
may
they
do
him
last
time
as
i
went
to
gaol
i
gave
them
him
to
kep
and
he
went
off
for
a
navvy
meantime
so
there
i
am
you
will
play
with
the
dogs
quoth
tregarva
know
what
you
will
be
bit
by
have
i
warned
you
of
course
you
wo
prosper
as
you
make
your
bed
so
you
must
lie
in
it
the
lord
ca
be
expected
to
let
those
prosper
that
forget
him
what
mercy
would
it
be
to
you
if
he
did
let
you
prosper
by
setting
snares
all
time
as
you
were
last
sunday
instead
of
going
to
church
say
paul
tregarva
i
told
you
my
mind
about
that
afore
if
i
do
do
what
i
knows
to
be
right
and
good
already
there
ai
no
use
in
me
a
damning
myself
all
the
deeper
by
going
to
church
to
hear
more
help
you
quoth
poor
paul
i
say
quoth
crawy
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
took
the
whole
thing
as
a
matter
of
course
no
more
to
be
repined
at
than
the
rain
and
wind
be
you
a
going
to
do
with
me
this
time
i
do
hope
you
wo
have
me
up
to
bench
a
month
now
as
i
out
o
prizzum
along
o
they
and
i
should
you
see
with
a
look
up
and
down
and
round
at
the
gay
and
the
fleet
water
and
the
soft
gleaming
clouds
which
to
lancelot
seemed
most
pathetic
should
like
to
ha
a
spell
o
fresh
air
like
afore
i
goes
in
again
tregarva
stood
over
him
and
looked
down
at
him
like
some
huge
stately
bloodhound
on
a
trembling
mangy
cur
heavens
thought
lancelot
as
his
eye
wandered
from
the
sad
steadfast
dignity
of
the
one
to
the
dogged
helpless
misery
of
the
other
those
two
be
really
even
animals
of
the
same
species
hard
to
believe
true
lancelot
but
to
quote
you
against
yourself
bacon
or
rather
the
instinct
which
taught
bacon
teaches
you
to
discern
the
invisible
common
law
under
the
deceitful
phenomena
of
sense
must
have
those
crawy
quoth
tregarva
at
length
i
must
starve
you
might
ever
so
well
take
away
the
dog
they
the
life
of
me
the
death
of
you
why
do
you
go
and
work
instead
of
idling
about
stealing
trout
you
a
laughing
at
a
poor
fellow
in
his
trouble
who
gie
me
a
day
work
i
like
to
know
it
twenty
year
too
late
for
that
lancelot
stood
listening
yes
that
wretch
too
was
a
man
and
a
brother
at
least
so
books
used
to
say
time
was
when
he
had
looked
on
a
poacher
as
a
pariah
humani
generis
and
only
deplored
that
the
law
forbade
him
to
shoot
them
down
like
cats
and
otters
but
he
had
begun
to
change
his
mind
he
had
learnt
and
learnt
rightly
the
the
danger
the
cruelty
of
indiscriminate
alms
it
looked
well
enough
in
theory
on
paper
but
but
thought
lancelot
practice
one
ca
help
feeling
a
little
of
that
feeling
called
pity
no
doubt
the
fellow
has
committed
an
unpardonable
sin
in
daring
to
come
into
the
world
when
there
was
no
call
for
him
one
used
to
think
certainly
that
children
opinions
were
not
consulted
on
such
points
before
they
were
born
and
that
therefore
it
might
be
hard
to
visit
the
sins
of
the
fathers
on
the
children
even
though
the
were
a
little
overstocked
mais
nous
avons
change
tout
cela
like
jourdain
doctors
no
doubt
too
the
fellow
might
have
got
work
if
he
had
chosen
in
kamschatka
or
the
cannibal
islands
for
the
political
economists
have
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
there
is
work
somewhere
or
other
for
every
one
who
chooses
to
work
but
as
unfortunately
society
has
neglected
to
inform
him
of
the
state
of
the
cannibal
island
or
to
pay
his
passage
thither
when
informed
thereof
he
has
had
to
choose
in
the
somewhat
limited
of
the
whitford
priors
union
whose
workhouse
is
already
every
winter
filled
with
bodied
men
than
he
between
starvation
and
this
well
as
for
employing
him
one
would
have
thought
that
there
was
a
little
work
waiting
to
be
done
in
those
five
miles
of
heather
and
which
i
used
to
tramp
over
last
winter
but
those
it
seems
are
still
on
the
margin
of
cultivation
and
not
a
remunerative
investment
that
is
to
capitalists
i
wonder
if
any
one
had
made
crawy
a
present
of
ten
acres
of
them
when
he
came
of
age
and
commanded
him
to
till
that
or
be
hanged
whether
he
would
not
have
found
it
a
profitable
investment
but
bygones
are
bygones
and
there
he
is
and
the
moors
thanks
to
the
rights
of
property
in
this
case
the
rights
of
the
dog
in
the
manger
belong
to
poor
old
lavington
that
is
the
game
and
timber
on
them
and
neither
crawy
nor
any
one
else
can
touch
them
what
can
i
do
for
him
convert
him
to
what
for
the
next
life
even
tregarva
talisman
seems
to
fail
and
for
this
life
perhaps
if
he
had
had
a
few
more
practical
proofs
of
a
divine
justice
and
government
that
kingdom
of
heaven
of
which
luke
talks
in
the
sensible
bodily
matters
which
he
does
appreciate
he
might
not
be
so
unwilling
to
trust
to
it
for
the
invisible
spiritual
matters
which
he
does
not
appreciate
at
all
events
one
has
but
one
chance
of
winning
him
and
that
is
through
those
five
senses
which
he
has
left
what
if
he
does
spend
the
money
in
gross
animal
enjoyment
what
will
the
amount
of
it
be
compared
with
the
animal
enjoyments
which
my
station
allows
me
daily
without
reproach
a
little
more
bacon
a
little
more
beer
a
little
more
tobacco
at
all
events
they
will
be
more
important
to
him
than
a
pair
of
new
boots
or
an
extra
box
of
cigars
to
me
and
lancelot
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
sovereign
no
doubt
he
was
a
great
goose
but
if
you
can
answer
his
arguments
reader
i
can
not
here
what
are
your
worth
matter
of
seven
shilling
ai
they
now
paul
tregarva
should
suppose
they
are
do
you
give
me
the
lines
one
and
all
and
there
a
sovereign
for
no
i
ca
trust
you
with
it
all
at
once
i
give
it
to
tregarva
and
he
shall
allow
you
four
shillings
a
week
as
long
as
it
lasts
if
you
promise
to
keep
off
squire
lavington
river
it
was
pathetic
and
yet
disgusting
to
see
the
abject
joy
of
the
poor
creature
thought
lancelot
he
deserves
to
be
wretched
so
do
i
why
therefore
if
we
are
one
as
bad
as
the
other
should
i
not
make
his
wretchedness
a
little
less
for
the
time
being
waint
come
the
water
you
trust
me
i
minds
them
as
is
kind
to
me
and
a
thought
seemed
suddenly
to
lighten
up
his
dull
intelligence
say
paul
hark
you
here
i
see
that
bantam
into
d
day
is
he
down
already
a
he
and
another
of
his
pals
and
i
see
take
out
a
silk
flue
i
did
so
says
i
you
maunt
be
trying
that
ere
along
o
the
whitford
trout
they
kepers
is
out
o
nights
so
sure
as
the
moon
did
know
that
lying
again
but
i
sayed
it
in
course
i
did
want
they
here
so
i
think
they
worked
mainly
up
squire
vaurien
water
wish
i
caught
them
here
quoth
tregarva
grimly
enough
i
do
think
they
came
or
i
should
have
seen
the
track
on
the
banks
he
sayed
like
as
how
he
should
be
down
here
again
about
pheasant
shooting
him
for
it
let
us
know
now
if
you
see
him
that
i
will
too
i
would
save
a
feather
for
that
old
rascal
harry
if
the
devil
do
have
he
i
do
see
no
use
in
keeping
no
devil
but
i
minds
them
as
has
mercy
on
me
though
my
name
is
crawy
ay
he
added
bitterly
tai
so
many
kind
turns
as
i
gets
in
this
life
that
i
can
afford
to
forget
a
one
and
he
sneaked
off
with
the
deaf
dog
at
his
heels
did
that
fellow
get
his
name
tregarva
most
of
them
have
nicknames
round
here
some
of
them
hardly
know
their
own
real
names
sir
sure
sign
of
low
civilisation
thought
lancelot
he
got
his
a
foolish
way
and
yet
it
was
the
ruin
of
him
when
he
was
a
boy
of
fifteen
he
got
miching
away
in
as
boys
will
and
took
off
his
clothes
to
get
in
somewhere
here
in
this
very
river
groping
in
the
banks
after
and
as
the
devil
for
i
can
think
no
less
would
have
it
a
big
one
catches
hold
of
him
by
the
fingers
with
one
claw
and
a
root
with
the
other
and
holds
him
there
till
squire
lavington
comes
out
to
take
his
walk
after
church
and
there
he
caught
the
boy
and
gave
him
a
thrashing
there
and
then
naked
as
he
stood
and
the
story
got
wind
and
all
the
chaps
round
called
him
crawy
ever
afterwards
and
the
poor
fellow
got
quite
reckless
from
that
day
and
never
looked
any
one
in
the
face
again
and
being
ashamed
of
himself
you
see
sir
was
never
ashamed
of
anything
else
and
there
he
is
that
dog
his
only
friend
and
gets
a
livelihood
for
them
both
it
growing
old
now
and
when
it
dies
he
starve
the
world
has
no
right
to
blame
him
for
not
doing
his
duty
till
it
has
done
its
own
by
him
a
little
better
the
world
will
sir
because
it
hates
its
duty
and
cries
all
day
long
like
cain
am
i
my
brother
keeper
you
think
it
knows
its
duty
i
have
found
it
easy
enough
to
see
that
something
is
diseased
tregarva
but
to
find
the
medicine
first
and
to
administer
it
afterwards
is
a
very
different
matter
i
suppose
the
world
will
never
be
mended
till
the
day
of
judgment
plain
english
not
mended
till
it
is
destroyed
hopeful
for
the
poor
world
i
should
fancy
if
i
believed
that
that
the
devil
in
the
old
history
which
you
believe
had
had
the
best
of
it
with
a
vengeance
when
he
brought
sin
into
the
world
and
ruined
it
i
dare
not
believe
that
how
dare
you
who
say
that
god
sent
his
son
into
the
world
to
defeat
the
devil
tregarva
was
silent
a
while
and
the
gospel
together
ought
to
do
something
sir
towards
mending
it
one
would
think
so
but
the
prophecies
are
against
that
folks
happen
to
read
them
just
now
a
hundred
years
hence
they
may
be
finding
the
very
opposite
meaning
in
them
come
tregarva
suppose
i
teach
you
a
little
of
the
learning
and
you
teach
me
a
little
of
the
gospel
do
you
think
we
two
could
mend
the
world
between
us
or
even
mend
whitford
priors
knows
sir
said
tregarva
said
lancelot
as
they
were
landing
the
next
trout
will
that
crawy
go
when
he
dies
knows
sir
said
tregarva
lancelot
went
thoughtful
home
and
sat
down
not
to
answer
luke
letter
for
he
knew
no
answer
but
tregarva
and
that
alas
he
could
not
give
for
he
did
not
believe
it
but
only
longed
to
believe
it
so
he
turned
off
the
subject
by
a
question
speak
of
yourself
as
being
already
a
member
of
the
romish
communion
how
is
this
have
you
given
up
your
curacy
have
you
told
your
father
i
fancy
that
if
you
had
done
so
i
must
have
heard
of
it
ere
now
i
entreat
you
to
tell
me
the
state
of
the
case
for
heathen
as
i
am
i
am
still
an
englishman
and
there
are
certain
old
superstitions
still
lingering
among
us
whencesoever
we
may
have
got
them
first
about
truth
and
common
honesty
you
understand
not
be
angry
but
there
is
a
prejudice
against
the
truthfulness
of
romish
priests
and
romish
it
no
affair
of
mine
i
see
quite
enough
protestant
rogues
and
liars
to
prevent
my
having
any
pleasure
in
proving
romanists
or
any
other
persons
rogues
and
liars
also
but
i
am
if
not
fond
of
you
at
least
sufficiently
fond
to
be
anxious
for
your
good
name
you
used
to
be
an
hearted
fellow
enough
do
prove
to
the
world

chapter
ix
harry
verney
hears
his
last
shot
fired
the
day
after
the
lavingtons
return
when
lancelot
walked
up
to
the
priory
with
a
fluttering
heart
to
inquire
after
all
parties
and
see
one
he
found
the
squire
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
a
large
gang
of
poachers
who
had
come
down
from
london
by
rail
had
been
devastating
all
the
covers
round
to
stock
the
london
markets
by
the
first
of
october
and
intended
as
tregarva
had
discovered
to
pay
lavington
preserves
a
visit
that
night
they
did
care
for
country
justices
not
they
were
all
their
fines
paid
by
highly
respectable
at
the
west
end
they
owned
three
among
them
a
parcel
by
railway
would
bring
them
down
bail
to
any
amount
they
tossed
their
money
away
at
the
houses
like
gentlemen
thanks
to
the
game
laws
their
profits
ran
high
and
when
they
had
swept
the
country
pretty
clean
of
game
why
they
would
just
finish
off
the
season
by
a
stray
highway
robbery
or
two
and
vanish
into
babylon
and
their
native
night
such
was
harry
verney
information
as
he
strutted
about
the
courtyard
waiting
for
the
squire
orders
they
put
their
nose
into
a
muster
smith
they
have
we
got
our
fourteen
men
sir
as
play
the
whole
vale
to
cricket
and
whap
them
and
every
one
fight
for
they
half
poachers
themselves
you
see
and
harry
winked
and
chuckled
they
ca
abide
no
interlopers
to
come
down
and
take
the
sport
out
of
their
mouths
are
you
sure
they
come
paul
says
so
wonder
how
he
found
out
some
of
his
underhand
colloguing
methodist
ways
i
warrant
i
seed
him
preaching
to
that
crawy
three
or
four
times
when
he
ought
to
have
hauled
him
up
he
consorts
with
them
poachers
sir
uncommon
i
hope
he
be
one
himself
that
all
harry
eh
do
say
old
harry
do
know
nothing
that
all
i
fixed
his
flint
anyhow
smith
shouted
the
squire
out
of
his
study
window
with
a
cheerful
and
appropriate
oath
very
man
i
wanted
to
see
you
must
lead
these
keepers
for
me
they
always
fight
better
with
a
gentleman
among
them
breeding
tells
you
know
breeding
tells
lancelot
felt
a
strong
disgust
at
the
occupation
but
he
was
under
too
many
obligations
to
the
squire
to
refuse
i
knew
you
were
game
said
the
old
man
you
find
it
capital
fun
i
used
to
think
it
so
i
know
when
i
was
young
many
a
shindy
have
i
had
here
in
my
uncle
time
under
the
very
windows
before
the
chase
was
disparked
when
the
fellows
used
to
come
down
after
the
deer
just
then
lancelot
turned
and
saw
argemone
standing
close
to
him
he
almost
sprang
towards
her
and
retreated
for
he
saw
that
she
had
overheard
the
conversation
between
him
and
her
father
mr
smith
said
she
in
a
tone
in
which
tenderness
and
contempt
pity
and
affected
carelessness
were
strangely
mingled
you
are
going
to
turn
gamekeeper
lancelot
was
blundering
out
something
when
the
squire
interposed
her
alone
smith
women
will
be
you
know
quite
right
but
they
do
understand
these
things
they
fight
with
their
tongues
and
we
with
our
fists
and
then
they
fancy
their
weapons
do
hurt
ha
ha
ha
smith
said
argemone
in
a
low
determined
voice
you
have
promised
my
father
to
go
on
this
horrid
business
go
but
promise
me
too
that
you
will
only
look
on
or
i
will
never
argemone
had
not
time
to
finish
her
sentence
before
lancelot
had
promised
seven
times
over
and
meant
to
keep
his
promise
as
we
all
do
about
ten
that
evening
lancelot
and
tregarva
were
walking
stealthily
up
a
ride
in
one
of
the
at
the
head
of
some
fifteen
fine
young
fellows
keepers
grooms
and
not
extempore
whom
old
harry
was
marshalling
and
tutoring
with
exhortations
as
many
and
as
animated
as
if
their
ambition
was
pour
la
patrie
does
this
sort
of
work
suit
you
tregarva
for
i
do
like
it
at
all
the
fighting
all
very
well
but
it
a
poor
cause
sir
i
have
no
mercy
on
these
londoners
if
it
was
these
poor
labourers
that
snare
the
same
hares
that
have
been
eating
up
their
all
the
week
i
ca
touch
them
sir
and
that
truth
but
these
ruffians
and
yet
sir
would
it
be
better
for
the
parsons
to
preach
to
them
than
for
the
keepers
to
break
their
heads
said
lancelot
parsons
say
all
to
them
that
they
can
tregarva
shook
his
head
doubt
that
sir
but
no
doubt
there
a
great
change
for
the
better
in
the
parsons
i
remember
the
time
sir
that
there
was
an
earnest
clergyman
in
the
vale
and
now
every
other
man
you
meet
is
trying
to
do
his
best
but
those
london
parsons
sir
what
the
matter
with
them
for
all
their
societies
and
their
schools
the
devil
seems
to
keep
ahead
of
them
sadly
i
doubt
they
have
found
the
right
fly
yet
for
publicans
and
sinners
to
rise
at
a
distant
shot
in
the
cover
they
are
sir
i
thought
that
crawy
would
lead
me
false
when
i
let
him
off
fight
away
then
and
win
i
have
promised
miss
lavington
not
to
lift
a
hand
in
the
business
you
a
lucky
man
sir
but
the
squire
game
is
his
own
and
we
must
do
our
duty
by
our
master
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
bushes
and
a
tramp
of
feet
on
the
turf
they
are
sir
sure
enough
the
lord
keep
us
from
murder
this
night
and
tregarva
pulled
off
his
neckcloth
and
shook
his
huge
limbs
as
if
to
feel
that
they
were
all
in
their
places
in
a
way
that
augured
ill
for
the
man
who
came
across
him
they
turned
the
corner
of
a
ride
and
in
an
instant
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
five
or
six
armed
men
with
blackened
faces
who
without
speaking
a
word
dashed
at
them
and
the
fight
began
reinforcements
came
up
on
each
side
and
the
engagement
became
general
were
sharp
and
stern
the
forest
blood
was
keen
they
lashed
together
for
life
and
death
beneath
the
hollies
green
metal
good
and
the
did
soon
in
splinters
flee
they
tossed
the
orts
to
south
and
north
and
grappled
knee
to
knee
wrestled
up
they
wrestled
down
they
wrestled
still
and
sore
the
herbage
sweet
beneath
their
feet
was
stamped
to
mud
and
gore
and
all
the
while
the
broad
still
moon
stared
down
on
them
grim
and
cold
as
if
with
a
saturnine
sneer
at
the
whole
humbug
and
the
silly
birds
about
whom
all
this
butchery
went
on
slept
quietly
over
their
heads
every
one
with
his
head
under
his
wing
oh
if
pheasants
had
but
understanding
how
they
would
split
their
sides
with
chuckling
and
crowing
at
the
follies
which
civilised
christian
men
perpetrate
for
their
precious
sake
had
i
the
pen
of
homer
though
they
say
he
never
used
one
or
even
that
of
the
worthy
who
wasted
precious
years
in
writing
a
homer
burlesqued
what
heroic
exploits
might
not
i
immortalise
in
every
stupid
serf
and
cunning
ruffian
there
there
was
a
heart
as
brave
as
ajax
own
but
then
they
fought
with
sticks
instead
of
lances
and
hammered
away
on
fustian
jackets
instead
of
brazen
shields
and
therefore
poor
fellows
they
were
beneath
dignity
of
poetry
whatever
that
may
mean
if
one
of
your
squeamish
poetry
critics
had
just
had
his
head
among
the
for
five
minutes
that
night
he
would
have
found
it
grim
tragic
earnest
enough
not
without
a
touch
of
fun
though
here
and
there
lancelot
leant
against
a
tree
and
watched
the
riot
with
folded
arms
mindful
of
his
promise
to
argemone
and
envied
tregarva
as
he
hurled
his
assailants
right
and
left
with
immense
strength
and
led
the
van
of
battle
royally
little
would
argemone
have
valued
the
real
proof
of
love
which
he
was
giving
her
as
he
looked
on
sulkily
while
his
fingers
tingled
with
longing
to
be
up
and
doing
strange
that
mere
lust
of
fighting
common
to
man
and
animals
whose
traces
even
the
lamb
and
the
civilised
child
evince
in
their
the
earliest
and
most
natural
form
of
play
is
it
after
all
the
one
human
propensity
which
is
utterly
evil
incapable
of
being
turned
to
any
righteous
use
gross
and
animal
no
doubt
it
is
but
not
the
less
really
pleasant
as
every
irishman
and
many
an
englishman
knows
well
enough
a
curious
instance
of
this
by
the
bye
occurred
in
paris
during
the
february
revolution
a
fat
english
coachman
went
out
from
mere
curiosity
to
see
the
fighting
as
he
stood
and
watched
a
new
passion
crept
over
him
he
grew
madder
and
madder
as
the
bullets
whistled
past
him
at
last
when
men
began
to
drop
by
his
side
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
seized
a
musket
and
rushed
in
careless
which
side
he
took
drink
delight
of
battle
with
his
peers
he
was
not
heard
of
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
they
found
him
stiff
and
cold
lying
on
his
face
across
a
barricade
with
a
bullet
through
his
heart
sedentary
persons
may
call
him
a
sinful
fool
be
it
so
homo
sum
humani
nihil
a
me
alienum
puto
lancelot
i
verily
believe
would
have
kept
his
promise
though
he
saw
that
the
keepers
gave
ground
finding
cockney
skill
too
much
for
their
clumsy
strength
but
at
last
harry
verney
who
had
been
fighting
as
venomously
as
a
wild
cat
and
had
been
once
before
saved
from
a
broken
skull
by
tregarva
rolled
over
at
his
very
feet
with
a
couple
of
poachers
on
him
wo
see
an
old
man
murdered
mr
smith
cried
he
imploringly
lancelot
tore
the
ruffians
off
the
old
man
right
and
left
one
of
them
struck
him
he
returned
the
blow
and
in
an
instant
promises
and
argemone
philosophy
and
prejudices
were
swept
out
of
his
head
and
went
as
the
old
romances
say
into
the
midst
of
the
press
as
mere
a
wild
animal
for
the
moment
as
angry
bull
or
boar
an
instant
afterwards
though
he
burst
out
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
as
battersea
bantam
who
had
been
ineffectually
dancing
round
tregarva
like
a
gamecock
spurring
at
a
bull
turned
off
with
a
voice
of
ineffable
disgust
big
cove
a
yokel
creditable
to
waste
science
on
him
you
my
man
if
you
please
sir
and
the
little
wiry
lump
of
courage
and
conceit
rascality
and
good
humour
flew
at
lancelot
who
was
twice
his
size
a
heroism
worthy
of
a
better
cause
as
respectable
papers
when
they
are
not
too
frightened
say
of
the
french
you
want
any
more
asked
lancelot
a
pleasure
sir
to
meet
a
scientific
beg
your
pardon
sir
stay
a
moment
while
i
wipes
my
face
now
sir
time
if
you
please
alas
for
the
little
man
in
another
moment
he
tumbled
over
and
lay
senseless
lancelot
thought
he
had
killed
him
the
gang
saw
their
champion
fall
gave
ground
and
limped
off
leaving
three
of
their
party
groaning
on
the
ground
beside
as
many
whitford
men
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
so
is
it
to
be
to
the
end
my
foolish
brothers
from
the
poacher
to
the
prime
minister
wearying
yourselves
for
very
vanity
the
soldier
is
not
the
only
man
in
england
who
is
fool
enough
to
be
shot
at
for
a
shilling
a
day
but
while
all
the
rest
were
busy
picking
up
the
wounded
men
and
securing
the
prisoners
harry
verney
alone
held
on
and
as
the
poachers
retreated
slowly
up
the
ride
he
followed
them
peering
into
the
gloom
as
if
in
hopes
of
recognising
some
old
enemy
back
harry
verney
we
know
you
and
we
be
loth
to
harm
an
old
man
cried
a
voice
out
of
the
darkness
do
you
think
old
harry
turn
back
when
he
was
once
on
the
track
of
ye
you
cockney
rascals
that
fancy
you
to
carry
the
county
before
you
because
you
get
your
fines
paid
by
eh
what
do
you
take
old
harry
for
back
you
old
fool
and
a
volley
of
oaths
followed
you
follow
us
we
fire
at
you
as
sure
as
the
moon
in
heaven
away
then
i
follow
you
to
and
the
old
man
paced
stealthily
but
firmly
up
to
them
tregarva
saw
his
danger
and
sprang
forward
but
it
was
too
late
you
will
have
it
then
a
sharp
crack
followed
a
bright
flash
in
the
darkness
every
white
and
jagged
shone
out
for
a
moment
as
bright
as
day
and
in
front
of
the
glare
lancelot
saw
the
old
man
throw
his
arms
wildly
upward
fall
forward
and
disappear
on
the
dark
ground
done
it
off
with
you
and
the
rascals
rushed
off
up
the
ride
in
a
moment
tregarva
was
by
the
old
man
side
and
lifted
him
tenderly
up
done
for
me
paul
old
harry
got
his
gruel
he
heard
his
last
shot
fired
i
knowed
it
come
to
this
and
i
said
it
eh
did
i
now
paul
and
as
the
old
man
spoke
the
workings
of
his
lungs
pumped
great
jets
of
blood
out
over
the
still
flowers
as
they
slept
in
the
moonshine
and
dabbled
them
with
smoking
gore
men
shouted
the
colonel
with
him
at
once
and
home
here
put
a
brace
of
your
guns
together
muzzle
and
lock
help
him
to
sit
on
them
lancelot
there
harry
put
your
arms
round
their
necks
tregarva
hold
him
up
behind
now
then
men
left
legs
foremost
keep
step
march
and
they
moved
off
towards
the
priory
seem
to
know
everything
colonel
said
lancelot
the
colonel
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
i
learnt
this
dodge
from
the
only
friend
i
ever
had
in
the
world
or
ever
shall
have
and
a
week
after
i
marched
him
home
to
his
deathbed
in
this
very
way
paul
tregarva
whispered
old
harry
your
head
down
here
wipe
my
mouth
there
a
man
it
wet
uncommon
wet
it
was
his
own
been
a
beast
to
you
paul
i
hated
you
and
envied
you
and
tried
to
ruin
you
and
now
you
saved
my
life
once
this
night
and
here
you
be
of
me
as
my
own
son
might
do
if
he
was
here
poor
fellow
i
ruined
you
paul
the
lord

me
pray
said
paul
he
will
forgive
you
he
is
all
mercy

pardoned
the
thief
on
the
cross
paul
no
thief
not
so
bad
as
that
i
hope
anyhow
never
touched
a
feather
of
the
squire
but
you
dropped
a
song
paul
a
bit
of
writing
paul
turned
pale
the
lord
forgive
me
i
put
it
in
the
squire
lord
forgive
you
amen
said
paul
solemnly
wearily
and
slowly
they
stepped
on
towards
the
old
man
cottage
a
messenger
had
gone
on
before
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
squire
lavington
and
the
girls
were
round
the
bed
of
their
old
retainer
they
sent
off
right
and
left
for
the
doctor
and
the
vicar
the
squire
was
in
a
frenzy
of
rage
and
grief
take
on
master
do
take
on
said
old
harry
as
he
lay
while
the
colonel
and
honoria
in
vain
endeavoured
to
stanch
the
wound
knowed
it
would
be
so
sooner
or
later
is
all
in
the
way
of
business
they
have
carried
off
a
bird
squire
not
a
bird
we
was
too
many
for
eh
paul
eh
is
that
cursed
doctor
said
the
squire
him
colonel
save
him
and
i
give
you
alas
the
charge
of
shot
at
a
few
feet
distance
had
entered
like
a
bullet
tearing
a
great
ragged
there
was
no
hope
and
the
colonel
knew
it
but
he
said
nothing
second
keeper
sighed
argemone
has
been
killed
here
oh
smith
must
this
be
is
god
blessing
on
all
this
lancelot
said
nothing
the
old
man
lighted
up
at
argemone
voice
the
beauty
there
the
pride
of
whitford
and
sweet
miss
honor
too
so
kind
to
nurse
a
poor
old
man
but
she
never
would
let
him
teach
her
to
catch
perch
would
she
she
was
always
too
ah
squire
when
we
dead
and
gone
dead
and
gone
squire
they
be
the
pride
of
whitford
still
and
they
keep
up
the
old
place
wo
you
my
darlings
and
the
old
name
too
for
you
know
there
must
always
be
a
lavington
in
whitford
priors
till
the
nun
pool
runs
up
to
ashy
down
a
curse
upon
the
lavingtons
sighed
argemone
to
herself
in
an
undertone
lancelot
heard
what
she
said
the
vicar
entered
but
he
was
too
late
the
old
man
strength
was
failing
and
his
mind
began
to
wander
he
murmured
to
himself
dark
and
windy
birds
wo
lie
not
old
harry
fault
how
black
it
grows
we
must
be
gone
by
nightfall
squire
where
that
young
dog
gone
arter
the
larks
the
brute
old
squire
lavington
sobbed
like
a
child
will
soon
be
home
my
man
said
the
vicar
that
you
have
a
saviour
in
heaven
cast
yourself
on
his
mercy
harry
shook
his
head
good
words
very
kind
very
heavy
gamebag
though
never
get
home
never
any
more
at
all
where
my
boy
tom
to
carry
it
send
for
my
boy
tom
he
was
always
a
good
boy
till
he
got
along
with
them
poachers
he
said
there
bells
ringing
in
my
head
come
you
here
paul
tregarva
he
pulled
tregarva
face
down
to
his
own
and
whispered
the
bells
for
miss
honor
wedding
paul
started
and
drew
back
harry
chuckled
and
grinned
for
a
moment
in
his
old
foxy
peering
way
and
then
wandered
off
again
that
thumping
and
roaring
alas
it
was
the
failing
pulsation
of
his
own
heart
the
weir
the
weir
me
away
thundering
over
squire
i
drowning
drowning
and
choking
oh
lord
how
deep
now
it
running
quieter
now
i
can
breathe
again
swift
and
oily
running
on
running
on
down
to
the
sea
see
how
the
grayling
sparkle
there
a
pike
my
fault
squire
so
help
me
do
swear
now
squire
old
men
and
dying
mau
swear
squire
how
steady
the
river
runs
down
lower
and
slower
lower
and
slower
now
it
quite
still
still
still
his
voice
sank
away
he
was
dead
no
once
more
the
light
flashed
up
in
the
socket
he
sprang
upright
in
the
bed
and
held
out
his
withered
paw
with
a
kind
of
wild
majesty
as
he
shouted
ai
such
a
head
of
hares
on
any
manor
in
the
county
and
them
the
last
words
of
harry
verney
he
fell
back
shuddered
a
rattle
in
his
throat
another
and
all
was
over
chapter
x
will
out
and
love
too
argemone
need
never
have
known
of
lancelot
share
in
the
poaching
affray
but
he
dared
not
conceal
anything
from
her
and
so
he
boldly
went
up
the
next
day
to
the
priory
not
to
beg
pardon
but
to
justify
himself
and
succeeded
and
before
long
he
found
himself
fairly
installed
as
her
pupil
nominally
in
spiritual
matters
but
really
in
subjects
of
which
she
little
dreamed
every
day
he
came
to
read
and
talk
with
her
and
whatever
objections
lavington
expressed
were
silenced
by
argemone
she
would
have
it
so
and
her
mother
neither
dared
nor
knew
how
to
control
her
the
daughter
had
utterly
and
her
less
educated
parent
who
was
clinging
in
honest
bigotry
to
the
old
forms
while
argemone
was
wandering
forth
over
the
chaos
of
the
strange
new
age
poor
homeless
noah
dove
seeking
rest
for
the
sole
of
her
foot
and
finding
none
and
now
all
motherly
influence
and
sympathy
had
vanished
and
lavington
in
fear
and
wonder
let
her
daughter
go
her
own
way
she
could
not
have
done
better
perhaps
for
providence
had
found
for
argemone
a
better
guide
than
her
mother
could
have
done
and
her
new
pupil
was
rapidly
becoming
her
teacher
she
was
matched
for
the
first
time
with
a
man
who
was
her
own
equal
in
intellect
and
knowledge
and
she
felt
how
real
was
that
sexual
difference
which
she
had
been
accustomed
to
consider
as
an
insolent
calumny
against
woman
proudly
and
indignantly
she
struggled
against
the
conviction
but
in
vain
again
and
again
she
argued
with
him
and
was
vanquished
or
at
least
what
is
far
better
made
to
see
how
many
different
sides
there
are
to
every
question
all
appeals
to
authority
he
answered
with
a
contemptuous
smile
best
authorities
he
used
to
say
what
question
do
not
the
best
authorities
flatly
contradict
each
other
and
why
because
every
man
believes
just
what
it
suits
him
to
believe
do
fancy
that
men
reason
themselves
into
convictions
the
prejudices
and
feelings
of
their
hearts
give
them
some
idea
or
theory
and
then
they
find
facts
at
their
leisure
to
prove
their
theory
true
every
man
sees
facts
through
narrow
spectacles
red
or
green
or
blue
as
his
nation
or
his
temperament
colours
them
and
he
is
quite
right
only
he
must
allow
us
the
liberty
of
having
our
spectacles
too
authority
is
only
good
for
proving
facts
we
must
draw
our
own
conclusions
and
argemone
began
to
suspect
that
he
was
right
at
least
to
see
that
her
opinions
were
mere
hearsays
picked
up
at
her
own
will
and
fancy
while
his
were
living
ideas
her
mind
was
beside
his
as
the
vase
of
cut
flowers
by
the
side
of
the
rugged
tree
whose
roots
are
feeding
deep
in
the
mother
earth
in
him
she
first
learnt
how
one
great
truth
received
into
the
depths
of
the
soul
germinates
there
and
bears
fruit
a
thousandfold
explaining
and
connecting
and
glorifying
innumerable
things
apparently
the
most
unlike
and
insignificant
and
daily
she
became
a
more
reverent
listener
and
gave
herself
up
half
against
her
will
and
conscience
to
the
guidance
of
a
man
whom
she
knew
to
be
her
inferior
in
morals
and
in
orthodoxy
she
had
worshipped
intellect
and
now
it
had
become
her
tyrant
and
she
was
ready
to
give
up
every
belief
which
she
once
had
prized
to
flutter
like
a
moth
round
its
fascinating
brilliance
who
can
blame
her
poor
girl
for
lancelot
humility
was
even
more
irresistible
than
his
eloquence
he
assumed
no
superiority
he
demanded
her
assent
to
truths
not
because
they
were
his
opinions
but
simply
for
the
truth
sake
and
on
all
points
which
touched
the
heart
he
looked
up
to
her
as
infallible
and
inspired
in
questions
of
morality
of
taste
of
feeling
he
listened
not
as
a
lover
to
his
mistress
but
rather
as
a
baby
to
its
mother
and
thus
half
unconsciously
to
himself
he
taught
her
where
her
true
kingdom
lay
the
heart
and
not
the
brain
enshrines
the
priceless
pearl
of
womanhood
the
oracular
jewel
the
and
thummim
before
which
gross
man
can
only
inquire
and
adore
and
in
the
meantime
a
change
was
passing
upon
lancelot
his
morbid
vanity
that
child
of
struggling
and
was
vanishing
away
and
as
tennyson
says
in
one
of
those
priceless
idyls
of
his
before
which
the
shade
of
theocritus
must
hide
his
diminished
head
was
altered
and
began
to
move
about
the
house
with
joy
and
with
the
certain
step
of
man
he
had
at
last
found
one
person
who
could
appreciate
him
and
in
deliberate
confidence
he
set
to
work
to
conquer
her
and
make
her
his
own
it
was
a
traitorous
return
but
a
very
natural
one
and
she
sweet
creature
walked
straight
into
the
pleasant
snare
utterly
blind
because
she
fancied
that
she
saw
clearly
in
the
pride
of
her
mysticism
she
had
fancied
herself
above
so
commonplace
a
passion
as
love
it
was
a
curious
feature
of
lower
humanity
which
she
might
investigate
and
analyse
harmlessly
as
a
cold
scientific
spectator
and
in
her
mingled
pride
and
purity
she
used
to
indulge
lancelot
in
metaphysical
disquisitions
about
love
and
beauty
like
that
first
one
in
their
walk
home
from
minchampstead
from
which
a
less
celestially
innocent
soul
would
have
shrunk
she
thought
forsooth
as
the
old
proverb
says
that
she
could
deal
in
honey
without
putting
her
hand
to
her
mouth
but
lancelot
knew
better
and
marked
her
for
his
own
and
daily
his
and
sense
of
rightful
power
developed
and
with
them
paradoxical
as
it
may
seem
the
bitterest
the
contact
of
her
stainless
innocence
the
growing
certainty
that
the
destiny
of
that
innocence
was
irrevocably
bound
up
with
his
own
made
him
shrink
from
her
whenever
he
remembered
his
own
guilty
career
to
remember
that
there
were
passages
in
it
which
she
must
never
know
that
she
would
cast
him
from
her
with
abhorrence
if
she
once
really
understood
their
vileness
to
think
that
amid
all
the
closest
bonds
of
love
there
must
for
ever
be
an
awful
silent
gulf
in
the
past
of
which
they
must
never
speak
that
she
would
bring
to
him
what
he
could
never
never
bring
to
her
the
thought
was
unbearable
and
as
hideous
recollections
used
to
rise
before
him
devilish
caricatures
of
his
former
self
mopping
and
mowing
at
him
in
his
dreams
he
would
start
from
his
lonely
bed
and
pace
the
room
for
hours
or
saddle
his
horse
and
ride
all
night
long
aimlessly
through
the
awful
woods
vainly
trying
to
escape
himself
how
gladly
at
those
moments
he
would
have
welcomed
centuries
of
a
material
hell
to
escape
from
the
more
awful
spiritual
hell
within
him
to
buy
back
that
pearl
of
innocence
which
he
had
cast
recklessly
to
be
trampled
under
the
feet
of
his
own
swinish
passions
but
no
that
which
was
done
could
never
be
undone
never
to
all
eternity
and
more
than
once
as
he
wandered
restlessly
from
one
room
to
another
the
barrels
of
his
pistols
seemed
to
glitter
with
a
cold
devilish
smile
and
call
to
him
to
us
and
with
one
touch
of
your
finger
send
that
bursting
spirit
which
throbs
against
your
brow
to
flit
forth
free
and
nevermore
to
defile
her
purity
by
your
presence
but
no
again
a
voice
within
seemed
to
command
him
to
go
on
and
claim
her
and
win
her
spite
of
his
own
vileness
and
in
after
years
slowly
and
in
fear
and
trembling
he
knew
it
for
the
voice
of
god
who
had
been
leading
him
to
become
worthy
of
her
through
that
bitter
shame
of
his
own
unworthiness
as
one
higher
than
them
would
have
it
she
took
a
fancy
to
read
homer
in
the
original
and
lancelot
could
do
no
less
than
offer
his
services
as
translator
she
would
prepare
for
him
portions
of
the
odyssey
and
every
day
that
he
came
up
to
the
priory
he
used
to
comment
on
it
to
her
and
so
for
many
a
week
in
the
dark
wainscoted
library
and
in
the
clipt
of
the
old
gardens
and
under
the
brown
autumn
trees
they
quarried
together
in
that
unexhausted
mine
among
the
records
of
the
rich
of
man
and
step
by
step
lancelot
opened
to
her
the
everlasting
significance
of
the
poem
the
unconscious
purity
which
lingers
in
it
like
the
last
rays
of
the
paradise
dawn
its
sense
of
the
dignity
of
man
as
man
the
religious
reverence
with
which
it
speaks
of
all
human
ties
human
strength
and
beauty
ay
even
of
merely
animal
human
appetites
as
and
godlike
symbols
she
could
not
but
listen
and
admire
when
he
introduced
her
to
the
sheer
paganism
of
schiller
gods
of
greece
for
on
this
subject
he
was
more
eloquent
than
on
any
he
had
gradually
in
fact
as
we
have
seen
dropped
all
faith
in
anything
but
nature
the
slightest
fact
about
a
bone
or
a
weed
was
more
important
to
him
than
all
the
books
of
divinity
which
argemone
lent
him
to
be
laid
by
unread
do
you
believe
in
she
asked
him
one
day
sadly
this
he
said
stamping
his
foot
on
the
ground
the
earth
i
stand
on
and
the
things
i
see
walking
and
growing
on
it
there
may
be
something
beside
it
what
you
call
a
spiritual
world
but
if
he
who
made
me
intended
me
to
think
of
spirit
first
he
would
have
let
me
see
it
first
but
as
he
has
given
me
material
senses
and
put
me
in
a
material
world
i
take
it
as
a
fair
hint
that
i
am
meant
to
use
those
senses
first
whatever
may
come
after
i
may
be
intended
to
understand
the
unseen
world
but
if
so
it
must
be
as
i
suspect
by
understanding
the
visible
one
and
there
are
enough
wonders
there
to
occupy
me
for
some
time
to
come
the
bible
argemone
had
given
up
long
ago
wasting
words
about
the
only
bible
as
yet
is
bacon
i
know
that
he
is
right
whoever
is
wrong
if
that
hebrew
bible
is
to
be
believed
by
me
it
must
agree
with
what
i
know
already
from
science
what
was
to
be
done
with
so
intractable
a
heretic
call
him
an
infidel
and
a
materialist
of
course
and
cast
him
off
with
horror
but
argemone
was
beginning
to
find
out
that
when
people
are
really
in
earnest
it
may
be
better
sometimes
to
leave
god
methods
of
educating
them
alone
instead
of
calling
the
poor
honest
seekers
hard
names
which
the
speakers
themselves
do
understand
but
words
would
fail
sometimes
and
in
default
of
them
lancelot
had
recourse
to
drawings
and
manifested
in
them
a
talent
for
thinking
in
visible
forms
which
put
the
climax
to
all
argemone
wonder
a
single
profile
even
a
mere
mathematical
figure
would
in
his
hands
become
the
illustration
of
a
spiritual
truth
and
in
time
every
fresh
lesson
on
the
odyssey
was
accompanied
by
its
illustration
some
bold
and
simple
outline
drawing
in
argemone
eyes
the
sketches
were
immaculate
and
inspired
for
their
chief
almost
their
only
fault
was
just
those
mere
anatomical
slips
which
a
woman
would
hardly
perceive
provided
the
forms
were
generally
graceful
and
bold
one
day
his
fancy
attempted
a
bolder
flight
he
brought
a
large
drawing
and
laying
it
silently
on
the
table
before
her
fixed
his
eyes
intensely
on
her
face
the
sketch
was
labelled
the
of
woman
in
the
foreground
to
the
right
and
left
were
scattered
groups
of
men
in
the
dresses
and
insignia
of
every
period
and
occupation
the
distance
showed
in
a
few
bold
outlines
a
dreary
desert
broken
by
alpine
ridges
and
furrowed
here
and
there
by
a
wandering
watercourse
long
shadows
pointed
to
the
sun
whose
disc
was
climbing
above
the
waste
horizon
and
in
front
of
the
sun
down
the
path
of
the
morning
beams
came
woman
clothed
only
in
the
armour
of
her
own
loveliness
her
bearing
was
stately
and
yet
modest
in
her
face
pensive
tenderness
seemed
wedded
with
earnest
joy
in
her
right
hand
lay
a
cross
the
emblem
of
sacrifice
her
path
across
the
desert
was
marked
by
the
flowers
which
sprang
up
beneath
her
steps
the
wild
gazelle
stept
forward
trustingly
to
lick
her
hand
a
single
wandering
butterfly
fluttered
round
her
head
as
the
group
one
by
one
caught
sight
of
her
a
human
tenderness
and
intelligence
seemed
to
light
up
every
face
the
scholar
dropt
his
book
the
miser
his
gold
the
savage
his
weapons
even
in
the
visage
of
the
sot
some
nobler
recollection
seemed
wistfully
to
struggle
into
life
the
artist
caught
up
his
pencil
the
poet
his
lyre
with
eyes
that
beamed
forth
sudden
inspiration
the
sage
whose
broad
brow
rose
above
the
group
like
some
torrent
furrowed
alp
scathed
with
all
the
temptations
and
all
the
sorrows
of
his
race
watched
with
a
thoughtful
smile
that
preacher
more
mighty
than
himself
a
youth
decked
out
in
the
most
fantastic
fopperies
of
the
middle
age
stood
with
clasped
hands
and
brimming
eyes
as
remorse
and
pleasure
struggled
in
his
face
and
as
he
looked
the
fierce
sensual
features
seemed
to
melt
and
his
flesh
came
again
to
him
like
the
flesh
of
a
little
child
the
slave
forgot
his
fetters
little
children
clapped
their
hands
and
the
stunted
savage
woman
sprung
forward
to
kneel
at
her
feet
and
see
herself
transfigured
in
that
new
and
divine
ideal
of
her
sex
descriptions
of
drawings
are
clumsy
things
at
best
the
reader
must
fill
up
the
sketch
for
himself
by
the
eye
of
faith
entranced
in
wonder
and
pleasure
argemone
let
her
eyes
wander
over
the
drawing
and
her
feelings
for
lancelot
amounted
almost
to
worship
as
she
apprehended
the
harmonious
unity
of
the
manifold
conception
the
rugged
boldness
of
the
groups
in
front
the
soft
grandeur
of
the
figure
which
was
the
lodestar
of
all
their
virginal
purity
of
the
whole
and
when
she
fancied
that
she
traced
in
those
bland
aquiline
lineaments
and
in
the
crisp
ringlets
which
floated
like
a
cloud
down
to
the
knees
of
the
figure
some
traces
of
her
own
likeness
a
dream
of
a
new
destiny
flitted
before
her
she
blushed
to
her
very
neck
and
as
she
bent
her
face
over
the
drawing
and
gazed
her
whole
soul
seemed
to
rise
into
her
eyes
and
a
single
tear
dropped
upon
the
paper
she
laid
her
hand
over
it
and
then
turned
hastily
away
do
not
like
it
i
have
been
too
bold
said
lancelot
fearfully
no
no
it
is
so
beautiful
so
full
of
deep
wisdom
but
may
leave
it
lancelot
slipped
silently
out
of
the
room
he
hardly
knew
why
and
when
he
was
gone
argemone
caught
up
the
drawing
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
covered
it
with
kisses
and
hid
it
as
too
precious
for
any
eyes
but
her
own
in
the
farthest
corner
of
her
secretaire
and
yet
she
fancied
that
she
was
not
in
love
the
vicar
saw
the
growth
of
this
intimacy
with
a
face
for
it
was
very
evident
that
argemone
could
not
serve
two
masters
so
utterly
contradictory
as
himself
and
lancelot
and
that
either
the
lover
or
the
must
speedily
resign
office
the
vicar
had
had
great
disadvantages
by
the
bye
in
fulfilling
the
latter
function
for
his
visits
at
the
priory
had
been
all
but
forbidden
and
argemone
state
had
been
directed
by
means
of
a
secret
correspondence
a
method
which
some
clergymen
and
some
young
ladies
too
have
discovered
in
the
last
few
years
to
be
quite
consistent
with
moral
delicacy
and
filial
obedience
john
bull
like
a
stupid
fellow
as
he
is
has
still
his
doubts
upon
the
point
but
he
should
remember
that
though
paul
tells
women
when
they
want
advice
to
ask
their
husbands
at
home
yet
if
the
poor
woman
has
no
husband
or
as
often
happens
her
husband
advice
is
unpleasant
to
whom
is
she
to
go
but
to
the
next
best
substitute
her
spiritual
cicisbeo
or
favourite
clergyman
in
sad
earnest
neither
husband
nor
parent
deserves
pity
in
the
immense
majority
of
such
cases
woman
will
have
guidance
it
is
her
delight
and
glory
to
be
led
and
if
her
husband
or
her
parents
will
not
meet
the
cravings
of
her
intellect
she
must
go
elsewhere
to
find
a
teacher
and
run
into
the
wildest
extravagances
of
private
judgment
in
the
very
hope
of
getting
rid
of
it
just
as
poor
argemone
had
been
led
to
do
and
indeed
she
had
of
late
wandered
into
very
strange
paths
would
to
god
they
were
as
uncommon
as
strange
both
she
and
the
vicar
had
a
great
wish
that
she
should
lead
a
life
but
then
they
both
disdained
to
use
common
means
for
their
object
the
good
old
english
plan
of
district
visiting
by
which
ladies
can
have
mercy
on
the
bodies
and
souls
of
those
below
them
without
casting
off
the
holy
discipline
which
a
home
even
the
most
ungenial
alone
supplies
savoured
too
much
of
mere
it
might
be
god
plan
for
christianising
england
just
now
but
that
was
no
reason
alas
for
its
being
their
plan
they
wanted
something
more
more
in
accordance
with
church
principles
for
indeed
is
it
not
the
business
of
the
church
to
correct
the
errors
of
providence
and
what
they
sought
they
found
at
once
in
a
certain
favourite
establishment
of
the
vicar
a
beguinage
or
nunnery
which
he
fostered
in
a
neighbouring
city
and
went
thither
on
all
high
tides
to
confess
the
young
ladies
who
were
in
all
things
nuns
but
bound
by
no
vows
except
of
course
such
as
they
might
choose
to
make
for
themselves
in
private
here
they
laboured
among
the
lowest
haunts
of
misery
and
sin
piously
and
enough
sweet
souls
in
hope
of
peculiar
crown
and
a
higher
place
in
heaven
than
the
relations
whom
they
had
left
behind
them
the
world
and
unshackled
by
the
interference
of
parents
and
other
such
merely
fleshly
relationships
which
as
they
can
not
have
been
instituted
by
god
merely
to
be
trampled
under
foot
on
the
path
to
holiness
and
can
not
well
have
instituted
themselves
unless
after
all
the
materialists
are
right
and
this
world
does
grind
of
itself
except
when
its
maker
happens
to
interfere
once
every
thousand
years
must
needs
have
been
instituted
by
the
devil
and
so
more
than
one
girl
in
that
nunnery
and
out
of
it
too
believed
in
her
inmost
heart
though
her
principles
by
a
happy
inconsistency
forbade
her
to
say
so
in
a
moment
of
excitement
fascinated
by
the
romance
of
the
notion
argemone
had
proposed
to
her
mother
to
allow
her
to
enter
this
beguinage
and
called
in
the
vicar
as
advocate
which
produced
a
correspondence
between
him
and
lavington
stormy
on
her
side
provokingly
calm
on
his
and
when
the
poor
lady
tired
of
raging
had
descended
to
an
affecting
appeal
to
his
human
sympathies
entreating
him
to
spare
a
mother
feelings
he
had
answered
with
the
same
impassive
fanaticism
that
was
surprised
at
her
putting
a
mother
selfish
feelings
in
competition
with
the
sanctity
of
her
child
and
that
his
own
daughter
shown
such
a
desire
for
a
higher
vocation
he
should
have
esteemed
it
the
very
highest
honour
to
which
lavington
answered
naively
enough
that
depended
very
much
on
what
his
daughter
was
like
so
he
was
all
but
forbidden
the
house
nevertheless
he
contrived
by
means
of
this
same
secret
correspondence
to
keep
alive
in
argemone
mind
the
longing
to
turn
nun
and
fancied
honestly
that
he
was
doing
god
service
while
he
was
pampering
the
poor
girl
lust
for
singularity
and
but
lately
argemone
letters
had
become
less
frequent
and
less
confiding
and
the
vicar
who
well
knew
the
reason
had
resolved
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
crisis
so
he
wrote
earnestly
and
peremptorily
to
his
pupil
urging
her
with
all
his
subtle
and
refined
eloquence
to
make
a
final
appeal
to
her
mother
and
if
that
failed
to
act
her
conscience
should
direct
her
and
enclosed
an
answer
from
the
superior
of
the
convent
to
a
letter
which
argemone
had
in
a
mad
moment
asked
him
to
write
the
superior
letter
spoke
of
argemone
joining
her
as
a
settled
matter
and
of
her
room
as
ready
for
her
while
it
lauded
to
the
skies
the
peaceful
activity
and
usefulness
of
the
establishment
this
letter
troubled
argemone
exceedingly
she
had
never
before
been
compelled
to
face
her
own
feelings
either
about
the
nunnery
or
about
lancelot
she
had
taken
up
the
fancy
of
becoming
a
sister
of
charity
not
as
honoria
might
have
done
from
genuine
love
of
the
poor
but
from
sense
of
duty
almsgiving
and
visiting
the
sick
were
one
of
the
methods
of
earning
heaven
prescribed
by
her
new
creed
she
was
ashamed
of
her
own
laziness
by
the
side
of
honoria
simple
benevolence
and
sad
though
it
may
be
to
have
to
say
it
she
longed
to
outdo
her
by
some
signal
act
of
she
had
looked
to
this
nunnery
too
as
an
escape
once
and
for
all
from
her
own
luxury
just
as
people
who
have
not
strength
to
be
temperate
take
refuge
in
teetotalism
and
the
thought
of
menial
services
towards
the
poor
however
distasteful
to
her
came
in
quite
prettily
to
fill
up
the
little
ideal
of
a
life
of
romantic
asceticisms
and
mystic
contemplation
which
gave
the
true
charm
in
her
eyes
to
her
wild
project
but
now
just
as
a
field
had
opened
to
her
cravings
after
poetry
and
art
wider
and
richer
than
she
had
ever
imagined
just
as
those
simple
childlike
views
of
man
and
nature
which
she
had
learnt
to
despise
were
assuming
an
awful
holiness
in
her
eyes
just
as
she
had
found
a
human
soul
to
whose
regeneration
she
could
devote
all
her
energies
to
be
required
to
give
all
up
perhaps
for
ever
and
she
felt
that
if
at
all
it
ought
to
be
for
ever
it
was
too
much
for
her
little
heart
to
bear
and
she
cried
bitterly
and
tried
to
pray
and
could
not
and
longed
for
a
strong
and
tender
bosom
on
which
to
lay
her
head
and
pour
out
all
her
doubts
and
struggles
and
there
was
none
her
mother
did
not
understand
hardly
loved
her
honoria
loved
her
but
understood
her
even
less
than
her
mother
pride
the
pride
of
intellect
the
pride
of
will
had
long
since
sealed
her
lips
to
her
own
and
then
out
of
the
darkness
of
her
heart
lancelot
image
rose
before
her
stronger
than
all
tenderer
than
all
and
as
she
remembered
his
magical
faculty
of
anticipating
all
her
thoughts
embodying
for
her
all
her
vague
surmises
he
seemed
to
beckon
her
towards
she
shuddered
and
turned
away
and
now
she
first
became
conscious
how
he
had
haunted
her
thoughts
in
the
last
few
months
not
as
a
soul
to
be
saved
but
as
a
living
man
his
face
his
figure
his
voice
his
every
gesture
and
expression
rising
clear
before
her
in
spite
of
herself
by
day
and
night
and
then
she
thought
of
his
last
drawing
and
the
looks
which
had
accompanied
it
unmistakable
looks
of
passionate
and
adoring
love
there
was
no
denying
it
she
had
always
known
that
he
loved
her
but
she
had
never
dared
to
confess
it
to
herself
but
now
the
earthquake
was
come
and
all
the
secrets
of
her
heart
burst
upward
to
the
light
and
she
faced
the
thought
in
shame
and
terror
unjust
i
have
been
to
him
how
cruel
thus
to
entice
him
on
in
hopeless
love
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
and
saw
in
the
mirror
opposite
the
reflection
of
her
own
exquisite
beauty
could
have
known
what
i
was
doing
i
knew
all
the
while
and
yet
it
is
so
delicious
to
feel
that
any
one
loves
me
is
it
selfishness
it
is
selfishness
to
pamper
my
vanity
on
an
affection
which
i
do
not
will
not
return
i
will
not
be
thus
in
debt
to
him
even
for
his
love
i
do
not
love
him
i
do
not
and
even
if
i
did
to
give
myself
up
to
a
man
of
whom
i
know
so
little
who
is
not
even
a
christian
much
less
a
churchman
ay
and
to
give
up
my
will
to
any
man
to
become
the
subject
the
slave
of
another
human
being
i
who
have
worshipped
the
belief
in
woman
independence
the
hope
of
woman
enfranchisement
who
have
felt
how
glorious
it
is
to
live
like
the
angels
single
and
what
if
i
cut
the
gordian
knot
and
here
make
once
for
all
a
vow
of
perpetual
celibacy
she
flung
herself
on
her
knees
she
could
not
collect
her
thoughts
she
said
am
not
prepared
for
this
it
is
too
solemn
to
be
undertaken
in
this
miserable
whirlwind
of
passion
i
will
fast
and
meditate
and
go
up
formally
to
the
little
chapel
and
there
devote
myself
to
god
and
in
the
meantime
to
write
at
once
to
the
superior
of
the
beguines
to
go
to
my
mother
and
tell
her
once
for
all
what
must
i
lose
him
must
i
give
him
up
not
his
love
i
can
not
give
up
that
would
that
i
could
but
no
he
will
love
me
for
ever
i
know
it
as
well
as
if
an
angel
told
me
but
to
give
up
him
never
to
see
him
never
to
hear
his
voice
never
to
walk
with
him
among
the
beech
woods
any
more
oh
argemone
argemone
miserable
girl
and
is
it
come
to
this
and
she
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
yes
argemone
it
is
come
to
this
and
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
just
what
you
are
doing
to
lie
there
and
cry
yourself
to
sleep
while
the
angels
are
laughing
kindly
if
a
solemn
public
who
settles
everything
for
them
will
permit
them
to
laugh
at
the
rickety
old
windmill
of
which
you
have
taken
for
a
real
giant
at
that
same
day
and
hour
as
it
chanced
lancelot
little
dreaming
what
the
said
windmill
was
grinding
for
him
was
scribbling
a
hasty
and
angry
answer
to
a
letter
of
luke
which
perhaps
came
that
very
morning
in
order
to
put
him
into
a
proper
temper
for
the
demolishing
of
windmills
it
ran
thus
my
good
cousin
so
i
expected
mari
magno
turbantibus
aequora
ventis
e
terra
magnum
alterius
spectare
laborem
pleasant
and
easy
for
you
protestants
for
i
will
call
you
what
you
are
in
spite
of
your
own
denials
a
truly
consistent
and
logical
protestant
and
therefore
a
materialist
easy
for
you
i
say
to
sit
on
the
shore
in
cold
cruel
and
tell
the
poor
wretch
buffeting
with
the
waves
what
he
ought
to
do
while
he
is
choking
and
thank
heaven
the
storm
has
stranded
me
upon
the
everlasting
rock
of
peter
but
it
has
been
a
sore
trouble
to
reach
it
protestants
who
look
at
creeds
as
things
to
be
changed
like
coats
whenever
they
seem
not
to
fit
them
little
know
what
we
ones
if
they
did
they
would
be
more
merciful
and
more
chary
in
the
requirements
of
us
just
as
we
are
in
the
very
throe
of
a
existence
the
excellent
man
to
whose
care
i
have
committed
myself
has
a
wise
and
a
tender
heart
he
saw
no
harm
in
my
concealing
from
my
father
the
spiritual
reason
of
my
giving
up
my
curacy
for
i
have
given
it
up
and
only
giving
the
outward
but
equally
true
reason
that
i
found
it
on
the
whole
an
ineligible
and
distressing
i
know
you
will
apply
to
such
an
act
that
disgusting
monosyllable
of
which
protestants
are
so
fond
he
felt
with
me
and
for
me
for
my
horror
of
giving
pain
to
my
father
and
for
my
wearied
and
excited
state
of
mind
and
strangely
enough
to
show
how
differently
according
to
the
difference
of
the
organs
the
same
object
may
appear
to
two
people
he
quoted
in
my
favour
that
very
verse
which
you
wrest
against
me
he
wished
me
to
show
my
father
that
i
had
only
changed
my
heaven
and
not
my
character
by
becoming
an
catholic
that
as
far
as
his
esteem
and
affection
were
founded
on
anything
in
me
the
ground
of
it
did
not
vanish
with
my
conversion
if
i
had
told
him
at
once
of
my
altered
opinions
he
would
have
henceforth
viewed
every
word
and
action
with
a
perjudiced
protestants
are
so
bigoted
but
if
after
seeing
me
for
a
month
or
two
the
same
luke
that
he
had
ever
known
me
he
were
gradually
informed
that
i
had
all
the
while
held
that
creed
which
he
had
considered
incompatible
with
such
a
life
as
i
hope
mine
would
be
you
must
see
the
effect
which
it
ought
to
i
do
doubt
that
you
will
complain
of
all
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
can
not
sympathise
with
that
superstitious
reverence
for
mere
verbal
truth
which
is
so
common
among
it
seems
to
me
they
throw
away
the
spirit
of
truth
in
their
idolatry
of
its
letter
for
instance
what
is
the
use
of
informing
a
man
of
a
true
fact
but
to
induce
a
true
opinion
in
him
but
if
by
clinging
to
the
exact
letter
of
the
fact
you
create
a
false
opinion
in
his
mind
as
i
should
do
in
my
father
case
if
by
telling
him
at
once
of
my
change
i
gave
him
an
unjust
horror
of
catholicism
you
do
not
tell
him
the
you
may
speak
what
is
true
to
you
but
it
becomes
an
error
when
received
into
his
if
his
mind
is
a
refracting
and
polarising
medium
if
the
crystalline
lens
of
his
soul
eye
has
been
changed
into
tourmaline
or
labrador
only
way
to
give
him
a
true
image
of
the
fact
is
to
present
it
to
him
already
properly
altered
in
form
and
adapted
to
suit
the
obliquity
of
his
vision
in
order
that
the
very
refractive
power
of
his
faculties
may
instead
of
distorting
it
correct
it
and
make
it
straight
for
him
and
so
a
verbal
wrong
in
fact
may
possess
him
with
a
right
see
the
whole
question
turns
on
your
protestant
deification
of
the
if
you
really
believed
as
you
all
say
you
do
that
the
nature
of
man
and
therefore
his
intellect
among
the
rest
was
utterly
corrupt
you
would
not
be
so
superstitiously
careful
to
tell
the
truth
as
you
call
it
because
you
would
know
that
man
heart
if
not
his
head
would
needs
turn
the
truth
into
a
lie
by
its
own
the
proper
use
of
reasoning
is
to
produce
opinion
and
if
the
subject
in
which
you
wish
to
produce
the
opinion
is
diseased
you
must
adapt
the
medicine
accordingly
to
all
which
lancelot
with
several
strong
curses
scrawled
the
following
answer
this
is
my
cousin
luke
well
i
shall
believe
henceforward
that
there
is
after
all
a
thousand
times
greater
moral
gulf
fixed
between
popery
and
tractarianism
than
between
tractarianism
and
the
extremest
protestantism
my
dear
fellow
i
wo
bother
you
by
cutting
up
your
charming
ambiguous
middle
terms
which
make
reason
and
reasoning
identical
or
your
theory
that
the
office
of
reasoning
is
to
induce
opinions
the
devil
take
opinions
right
or
wrong
i
want
facts
faith
in
real
facts
or
about
deifying
the
intellect
as
if
all
sound
intellect
was
not
in
itself
divine
light
a
revelation
to
man
of
absolute
laws
independent
of
him
as
the
very
heathens
hold
but
this
i
will
do
thank
you
most
sincerely
for
the
compliment
you
pay
us
cismontane
heretics
we
do
retain
some
dim
belief
in
a
god
even
i
am
beginning
to
believe
in
believing
in
him
and
therefore
as
i
begin
to
suppose
it
is
that
we
reverence
facts
as
the
work
of
god
his
acted
words
and
will
which
we
dare
not
falsify
which
we
believe
will
tell
their
own
story
better
than
we
can
tell
it
for
them
if
our
eyes
are
dimmed
we
think
it
safer
to
clear
them
which
do
belong
to
us
than
to
bedevil
by
the
light
of
those
very
already
dimmed
eyes
the
objects
round
which
do
not
belong
to
us
whether
we
are
consistent
or
not
about
the
corruptness
of
man
we
are
about
the
incorruptness
of
god
and
therefore
about
that
of
the
facts
by
which
god
teaches
men
and
believe
and
will
continue
to
believe
that
the
blackest
of
all
sins
the
deepest
of
all
atheisms
that
which
above
all
things
proves
no
faith
in
god
government
of
the
universe
no
sense
of
his
presence
no
understanding
of
his
character
is
a
lie
word
more
unless
you
tell
your
father
within
hours
after
receiving
this
letter
i
will
and
i
being
a
protestant
if
cursing
popery
means
protestantism
mean
what
i
say
as
lancelot
walked
up
to
the
priory
that
morning
the
reverend
panurgus
dashed
out
of
a
cottage
by
the
roadside
and
seized
him
unceremoniously
by
the
shoulders
he
was
a
specimen
of
humanity
which
lancelot
could
not
help
at
once
liking
and
despising
a
quaint
mixture
of
conceit
and
earnestness
uniting
the
shrewdness
of
a
stockjobber
with
the
frolic
of
a
schoolboy
broke
loose
he
was
rector
of
a
place
in
the
west
of
ireland
containing
some
ten
protestants
and
some
thousand
papists
being
unfortunately
for
himself
a
orangeman
he
had
thought
fit
to
quarrel
with
the
priest
in
consequence
of
which
he
found
himself
deprived
both
of
tithes
and
congregation
and
after
receiving
three
or
four
rockite
letters
and
a
charge
of
slugs
through
his
hat
of
which
he
always
talked
as
if
being
shot
at
was
the
most
pleasant
and
amusing
feature
of
irish
life
he
repaired
to
england
and
there
after
trying
to
set
up
as
popular
preacher
in
london
declaiming
at
exeter
hall
and
writing
for
all
the
magazines
found
himself
incumbent
of
lower
whitford
he
worked
there
as
he
said
himself
a
horse
spent
his
mornings
in
the
schools
his
afternoons
in
the
cottages
preached
four
or
five
extempore
sermons
every
week
to
overflowing
congregations
took
the
lead
by
virtue
of
the
of
the
gab
at
all
meetings
for
ten
miles
round
and
really
did
a
great
deal
of
good
in
his
way
he
had
an
unblushing
candour
about
his
own
worldly
ambition
with
a
tremendous
brogue
and
prided
himself
on
exaggerating
deliberately
both
of
these
excellences
top
of
the
morning
to
ye
smith
ye
have
such
a
thing
as
a
cegar
about

i
been
preaching
to
till
me
throat
as
dry
as
the
slave
of
a
coat
am
very
sorry
but
really
i
have
left
my
case
at
home
ah
faix
and
i
forgot
ye
must
be
smokin
the
nasty
things
going
up
to
the
castle
och
smith
but
you
the
lucky
man
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
compliment
said
lancelot
gruffly
really
i
do
see
how
i
deserve
it
it
sure
luck
all
and
that
your
luck
and
not
your
deserts
at
all
to
have
the
handsomest
girl
in
the
county
dying
for
love
of
ye
panurgus
had
a
happy
knack
of
blurting
out
truths
when
they
were
pleasant
ones
she
just
the
beautifulest
creature
that
ever
spilte
barring
lady
philandria
mountflunkey
of
castle
mountflunkey
quane
county
that
shall
be
nameless
my
word
you
seem
to
be
better
acquainted
with
my
matters
than
i
am
do
you
think
on
the
whole
it
might
be
better
to
mind
your
own
business
own
business
poker
o
moses
and
ai
it
me
own
business
have
ye
spilte
my
tenderest
hopes
and
good
luck
to
ye
in
that
same
for
ye
as
pretty
a
rider
as
ever
kicked
out
of
a
wall
and
poor
paddy
loves
a
sportsman
by
nature
och
but
ye
got
a
hand
of
trumps
this
time
did
i
mate
the
vicar
the
other
day
and
spake
my
mind
to
him
do
you
mean
asked
lancelot
with
a
strong
expletive
i
told
him
he
might
as
well
faugh
a
ballagh
make
a
rid
road
and
get
out
of
that
with
his
bowings
and
his
crossings
and
his
popery
made
asy
for
small
minds
for
there
was
a
gun
that
would
wipe
his
eye
maning
yourself
ye
prathestant
i
can
say
is
that
you
had
really
better
mind
your
own
business
and
i
mind
my
own
said
the
irishman
it
you
must
mind
my
business
and
i
mind
yours
and
that
all
fair
and
aqual
ye
cut
me
out
intirely
at
the
priory
ye
tory
and
so
ye
bound
to
give
me
a
lift
somehow
could
ye
look
me
out
a
fine
fat
widow
with
an
illigant
little
fortune
for
what
england
made
for
except
to
find
poor
paddy
a
wife
and
money
ah
ye
may
laugh
but
i
buy
me
a
chapel
at
the
me
talents
are
thrown
away
here
intirely
wasting
me
swateness
on
the
desert
air
as
tom
moore
says
panurgus
used
to
attribute
all
quotations
whatsoever
to
irish
geniuses
i
flatter
meself
i
the
boy
to
shute
the
gospel
to
the
aristocracy
lancelot
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
and
escaped
over
the
next
gate
but
the
irishman
coarse
hints
stuck
by
him
as
they
were
intended
to
do
for
the
love
of
me
he
knew
it
was
an
impudent
exaggeration
but
somehow
it
gave
him
confidence
is
no
smoke
he
thought
fire
and
his
heart
beat
high
with
new
hopes
for
which
he
laughed
at
himself
all
the
while
it
was
just
the
cordial
which
he
needed
that
conversation
determined
the
history
of
his
life
he
met
argemone
that
morning
in
the
library
as
usual
but
he
soon
found
that
she
was
not
thinking
of
homer
she
was
moody
and
abstracted
and
he
could
not
help
at
last
saying
am
afraid
i
and
my
classics
are
de
trop
this
morning
miss
lavington
no
no
never
that
she
turned
away
her
head
he
fancied
that
it
was
to
hide
a
tear
suddenly
she
rose
and
turned
to
him
with
a
clear
calm
gentle
gaze
to
me
smith
we
must
part
and
for
ever
this
intimacy
has
gone
on
too
long
i
am
afraid
for
your
happiness
and
now
like
all
pleasant
things
in
this
miserable
world
it
must
cease
i
can
not
tell
you
why
but
you
will
trust
me
i
thank
you
for
it
i
thank
god
for
it
i
have
learnt
things
from
it
which
i
shall
never
forget
i
have
learnt
at
least
from
it
to
esteem
and
honour
you
you
have
vast
powers
nothing
nothing
i
believe
is
too
high
for
you
to
attempt
and
succeed
but
we
must
part
and
now
god
be
with
you
oh
that
you
would
but
believe
that
these
glorious
talents
are
his
loan
that
you
would
but
be
a
true
and
loyal
knight
to
him
who
said
learn
of
me
for
i
am
meek
and
lowly
of
heart
and
ye
shall
find
rest
unto
your
souls
ay
she
went
on
more
and
more
passionately
for
she
felt
that
not
she
but
one
mightier
than
herself
was
speaking
through
her
you
might
be
great
indeed
then
i
might
watch
your
name
from
afar
rising
higher
and
higher
daily
in
the
ranks
of
god
own
heroes
i
see
it
and
you
have
taught
me
to
see
it
that
you
are
meant
for
a
faith
nobler
and
deeper
than
all
doctrines
and
systems
can
give
you
must
become
the
philosopher
who
can
discover
new
truths
the
artist
who
can
embody
them
in
new
forms
while
poor
i
and
that
is
another
reason
why
we
should
hush
hear
me
out
i
must
not
be
a
clog
to
drag
you
down
in
your
course
take
this
and
farewell
and
remember
that
you
once
had
a
friend
called
argemone
she
put
into
his
hands
a
little
bible
he
took
it
and
laid
it
down
on
the
table
for
a
minute
he
stood
silent
and
rooted
to
the
spot
disappointment
shame
rage
hatred
all
boiled
up
madly
within
him
the
bitterest
insults
rose
to
his
lips
pedant
fanatic
but
they
sank
again
unspoken
as
he
looked
into
the
celestial
azure
of
those
eyes
calm
and
pure
as
a
soft
evening
sky
a
mighty
struggle
between
good
and
evil
shook
his
heart
to
the
roots
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
his
soul
breathed
out
one
real
prayer
that
god
would
help
him
now
or
never
to
play
the
man
and
in
a
moment
the
darkness
passed
a
new
spirit
called
out
all
the
latent
strength
within
him
and
gently
and
proudly
he
answered
her
i
will
go
i
have
had
mad
dreams
conceited
and
insolent
and
have
met
with
my
deserts
brute
and
fool
as
i
am
i
have
aspired
even
to
you
and
i
have
gained
in
the
sunshine
of
your
condescension
strength
and
is
not
that
enough
for
me
and
now
i
will
show
you
that
i
love
you
by
obeying
you
you
tell
me
to
depart
i
go
for
ever
he
turned
away
why
did
she
almost
spring
after
him
one
word
do
not
misunderstand
me
as
i
know
you
will
you
will
think
me
so
cold
heartless
oh
you
do
not
know
you
never
can
know
how
much
i
too
have
felt
he
stopped
in
an
instant
his
conversation
with
the
irishman
flashed
up
before
him
with
new
force
and
meaning
a
thousand
petty
incidents
which
he
had
driven
contemptuously
from
his
mind
returned
as
triumphant
evidences
and
with
an
impetuous
determination
he
cried
out
see
i
see
it
all
argemone
we
love
each
other
you
are
mine
never
to
be
parted
what
was
her
womanhood
that
it
could
stand
against
the
energy
of
his
manly
will
the
almost
coarse
simplicity
of
his
words
silenced
her
with
a
delicious
violence
she
could
only
bury
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sob
out
lancelot
lancelot
whither
are
you
forcing
me
am
forcing
you
no
whither
god
the
father
of
spirits
is
leading
you
you
who
believe
in
him
how
dare
you
fight
against
him
i
can
not
i
can
not
listen
to
you
read
that
and
she
handed
him
the
vicar
letter
he
read
it
tossed
it
on
the
carpet
and
crushed
it
with
his
heel
pedant
can
your
intellect
be
deluded
by
such
barefaced
sophistries
god
will
forsooth
and
if
your
mother
opposition
is
not
a
sign
that
god
will
if
it
mean
anything
except
your
own
will
or
that
that
man
is
against
this
mad
project
and
not
for
it
what
sign
would
you
have
so
celibacy
is
the
highest
state
and
why
because
it
is
the
safest
and
the
easiest
road
to
heaven
a
pretty
reason
vicar
i
should
have
thought
that
that
was
a
sign
of
a
lower
state
and
not
a
higher
noble
spirits
show
their
nobleness
by
daring
the
most
difficult
paths
and
even
if
marriage
was
but
one
of
temptations
as
these
miserable
pedants
say
who
have
either
never
tried
it
or
misused
it
to
their
own
shame
it
would
be
a
greater
deed
to
conquer
its
temptations
than
to
flee
from
them
in
cowardly
longings
after
ease
and
safety
she
did
not
answer
him
but
kept
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
i
say
argemone
will
you
fight
against
fate
providence
god
call
it
what
you
will
who
made
us
meet
at
the
chapel
who
made
me
by
my
accident
a
guest
in
your
father
house
who
put
it
into
your
heart
to
care
for
my
poor
soul
who
gave
us
this
strange
attraction
towards
each
other
in
spite
of
our
unlikeness
wonderful
that
the
very
chain
of
circumstances
which
you
seem
to
fancy
the
offspring
of
chance
or
the
devil
should
have
first
taught
me
to
believe
that
there
is
a
god
who
guides
us
argemone
speak
tell
me
if
you
will
to
go
for
ever
but
tell
me
first
the
truth
you
love
me
a
strong
shudder
ran
through
her
frame
the
ice
of
artificial
years
cracked
and
the
clear
stream
of
her
woman
nature
welled
up
to
the
light
as
pure
as
when
she
first
lay
on
her
mother
bosom
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
and
with
one
long
look
of
passionate
tenderness
she
faltered
out
love
you
he
did
not
stir
but
watched
her
with
clasped
hands
like
one
who
in
dreams
finds
himself
in
some
fairy
palace
and
fears
that
a
movement
may
break
the
spell
go
she
said
and
let
me
collect
my
thoughts
all
this
has
been
too
much
for
me
do
not
look
sad
you
may
come
again
morrow
she
smiled
and
held
out
her
hand
he
caught
it
covered
it
with
kisses
and
pressed
it
to
his
heart
she
half
drew
it
back
frightened
the
sensation
was
new
to
her
again
the
delicious
feeling
of
being
utterly
in
his
power
came
over
her
and
she
left
her
hand
upon
his
heart
and
blushed
as
she
felt
its
passionate
throbbings
he
turned
to
go
not
as
before
she
followed
with
greedy
eyes
her
treasure
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
she
felt
as
if
lancelot
was
the
whole
world
and
there
was
nothing
beside
him
and
wondered
how
a
moment
had
made
him
all
in
all
to
her
and
then
she
sank
upon
her
knees
and
folded
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
and
her
prayers
for
him
were
like
the
prayers
of
a
little
child
chapter
xi
thunderstorm
the
first
but
what
had
become
of
the
of
writing
which
harry
verney
by
the
instigation
of
his
evil
genius
had
put
into
the
squire
book
tregarva
had
waited
in
terrible
suspense
for
many
weeks
expecting
the
explosion
which
he
knew
must
follow
its
discovery
he
had
confided
to
lancelot
the
contents
of
the
paper
and
lancelot
had
tried
many
stratagems
to
get
possession
of
it
but
all
in
vain
tregarva
took
this
as
calmly
as
he
did
everything
else
only
once
on
the
morning
of
the
eclaircissement
between
lancelot
and
argemone
he
talked
to
lancelot
of
leaving
his
place
and
going
out
to
seek
his
fortune
but
some
spell
which
he
did
not
explain
seemed
to
chain
him
to
the
priory
lancelot
thought
it
was
the
want
of
money
and
offered
to
lend
him
ten
pounds
whenever
he
liked
but
tregarva
shook
his
head
have
treated
me
sir
as
no
one
else
has
done
like
a
man
and
a
friend
but
i
am
not
going
to
make
a
market
of
your
generosity
i
will
owe
no
man
anything
save
to
love
one
another
how
do
you
intend
to
live
asked
lancelot
as
they
stood
together
in
the
cloisters
enough
of
me
sir
to
make
a
good
navigator
if
all
trades
fail
you
must
not
throw
yourself
away
so
sir
there
good
to
be
done
believe
me
among
those
poor
fellows
they
wander
up
and
down
the
land
like
hogs
and
heathens
and
no
one
tells
them
that
they
have
a
soul
to
be
saved
not
one
parson
in
a
thousand
gives
a
thought
to
them
they
can
manage
old
folks
and
little
children
sir
but
somehow
they
never
can
get
hold
of
the
young
men
just
those
who
want
them
most
there
a
talk
about
ragged
schools
now
why
do
they
try
ragged
churches
sir
and
a
ragged
service
do
you
mean
sir
the
parsons
are
ready
enough
to
save
souls
but
it
must
be
only
according
to
rule
and
regulation
before
the
gospel
can
be
preached
there
must
be
three
thousand
pounds
got
together
for
a
church
and
a
thousand
for
an
endowment
not
to
mention
the
thousand
pounds
that
the
clergyman
education
costs
i
do
think
of
his
own
keep
sir
that
little
enough
often
and
those
that
work
hardest
get
least
pay
it
seems
to
me
but
after
all
that
expense
when
they
built
the
church
it
the
tradesmen
and
the
gentry
and
the
old
folk
that
fill
it
and
the
working
men
never
come
near
it
from
one
year
end
to
another
the
cause
do
you
think
asked
lancelot
who
had
himself
remarked
the
same
thing
more
than
once
of
the
reason
sir
i
do
believe
is
that
same
not
that
the
ai
a
fine
book
enough
and
a
true
one
but
do
you
see
sir
to
understand
the
virtue
of
it
the
poor
fellows
ought
to
be
already
just
what
you
want
to
make
them
mean
that
they
ought
to
be
thorough
christians
already
to
appreciate
the
spirituality
of
the
liturgy
hit
it
sir
and
see
what
comes
of
the
present
plan
how
a
navvy
drops
into
a
church
by
accident
and
there
he
has
to
sit
like
a
fish
out
of
water
through
that
hour
service
staring
or
sleeping
before
he
can
hear
a
word
that
he
understands
and
sir
when
the
sermon
does
come
at
last
it
not
many
of
them
can
make
much
out
of
those
fine
and
long
sentences
why
do
they
have
a
short
simple
service
now
and
then
that
might
catch
the
ears
of
the
roughs
and
the
blowens
without
tiring
out
the
poor
thoughtless
creatures
patience
as
they
do
now
said
lancelot
i
really
do
know
but
i
think
there
is
a
simpler
plan
than
even
a
ragged
service
then
sir
if
the
mountain
wo
come
to
mahomet
let
mahomet
go
to
the
mountain
sir
right
you
are
go
out
into
the
highways
and
hedges
and
compel
them
to
come
in
and
why
are
they
to
speak
to
them
only
one
by
one
why
not
by
the
dozen
and
the
hundred
we
wesleyans
know
sir
for
the
matter
of
that
every
soldier
knows
what
virtue
there
is
in
getting
a
lot
of
men
together
how
good
and
evil
spread
like
wildfire
through
a
crowd
and
one
man
if
you
can
stir
him
up
will
become
leaven
to
leaven
the
whole
lump
oh
why
sir
are
they
so
afraid
of
was
not
their
master
and
mine
the
prince
of
all
think
if
the
apostles
had
waited
to
collect
subscriptions
for
a
church
before
they
spoke
to
the
poor
heathens
where
should
we
have
been
now
lancelot
could
not
but
agree
but
at
that
moment
a
footman
came
up
and
with
a
face
half
laughing
half
terrified
said
master
wants
you
in
the
study
and
please
sir
i
think
you
had
better
go
in
too
master
knows
you
here
and
you
might
speak
a
word
for
good
for
he
raging
like
a
mad
bull
knew
it
would
come
at
last
said
tregarva
quietly
as
he
followed
lancelot
into
the
house
it
had
come
at
last
the
squire
was
sitting
in
his
study
purple
with
rage
while
his
daughters
were
trying
vainly
to
pacify
him
all
the
grooms
and
helpers
were
drawn
up
in
line
along
the
wall
and
greeted
tregarva
whom
they
all
heartily
liked
with
sly
and
sorrowful
looks
of
warning
you
sir
you
look
at
this
is
this
the
way
you
repay
me
i
who
have
kept
you
out
of
the
workhouse
treated
you
like
my
own
child
and
then
to
go
and
write
filthy
rascally
radical
ballads
on
me
and
mine
this
comes
of
your
methodism
you
canting
sneaking
hypocrite
you
viper
you
adder
you
snake
you
and
the
squire
whose
vocabulary
was
not
large
at
a
loss
for
another
synonym
rounded
off
his
oration
by
a
torrent
of
oaths
at
which
argemone
taking
honoria
hand
walked
proudly
out
of
the
room
with
one
glance
at
lancelot
of
mingled
shame
and
love
is
your
handwriting
you
villain
you
know
it
and
the
squire
tossed
the
fatal
paper
across
the
table
i
suppose
you
lie
about
it
how
can
you
depend
on
fellows
who
speak
evil
of
their
betters
but
all
the
servants
are
ready
to
swear
it
your
handwriting
your
pardon
sir
interposed
the
old
butler
did
quite
say
that
but
we
all
swear
it
is
ours
paper
is
mine
said
tregarva
your
coolness
he
no
more
ashamed
of
it
than
read
it
out
smith
read
it
out
every
word
and
let
them
all
hear
how
this
pauper
this
vagabond
whom
i
have
bred
up
to
insult
me
dares
to
abuse
his
own
master
have
not
abused
you
sir
answered
tregarva
will
be
heard
sir
he
went
on
in
a
voice
which
made
the
old
man
start
from
his
seat
and
clench
his
fist
but
he
sat
down
again
a
word
in
it
is
meant
for
you
you
have
been
a
kind
and
a
good
master
to
me
ask
where
you
will
if
i
was
ever
heard
to
say
a
word
against
you
i
would
have
cut
off
my
right
hand
sooner
than
write
about
you
or
yours
but
what
i
had
to
say
about
others
lies
there
and
i
am
not
ashamed
of
it
against
me
read
it
out
smith
and
see
if
every
word
of
it
do
hit
at
me
and
at
my
daughters
too
by
worst
of
all
read
it
out
i
say
lancelot
hesitated
but
the
squire
who
was
utterly
beside
himself
began
to
swear
at
him
also
as
masters
of
hounds
are
privileged
to
do
and
lancelot
to
whom
the
whole
scene
was
becoming
every
moment
more
and
more
intensely
ludicrous
thought
it
best
to
take
up
the
paper
and
begin
rough
rhyme
on
a
rough
matter
merry
brown
hares
came
leaping
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
where
the
clover
and
corn
lay
sleeping
under
the
moonlight
still
late
and
early
till
under
their
bite
and
their
tread
the
swedes
and
the
wheat
and
the
barley
lay
cankered
and
trampled
and
dead
poacher
widow
sat
sighing
on
the
side
of
the
white
chalk
bank
where
under
the
gloomy
one
spot
in
the
ley
throve
rank
watched
a
long
tuft
of
clover
where
rabbit
or
hare
never
ran
for
its
black
sour
haulm
covered
over
the
blood
of
a
murdered
man
thought
of
the
dark
plantation
and
the
hares
and
her
husband
blood
and
the
voice
of
her
indignation
rose
up
to
the
throne
of
god
i
am
long
past
wailing
and
whining
i
have
wept
too
much
in
my
life
i
had
twenty
years
of
pining
as
an
english
labourer
wife
a
labourer
in
christian
england
where
they
cant
of
a
saviour
name
and
yet
waste
men
lives
like
the
for
a
few
more
brace
of
game
there
blood
on
your
new
foreign
shrubs
squire
there
blood
on
your
pointer
feet
there
blood
on
the
game
you
sell
squire
and
there
blood
on
the
game
you
eat
villain
interposed
the
squire
did
i
ever
sell
a
head
of
game
you
have
sold
the
labouring
man
squire
body
and
soul
to
shame
to
pay
for
your
seat
in
the
house
squire
and
to
pay
for
the
feed
of
your
game
made
him
a
poacher
yourself
squire
when
you
give
neither
work
nor
meat
and
your
hares
robbed
the
garden
at
our
starving
children
feet
when
packed
in
one
reeking
chamber
man
maid
mother
and
little
ones
lay
while
the
rain
pattered
in
on
the
rotting
and
the
walls
let
in
the
day
when
we
lay
in
the
burning
fever
on
the
mud
of
the
cold
clay
floor
till
you
parted
us
all
for
three
months
squire
at
the
cursed
workhouse
door
quarrelled
like
brutes
and
who
wonders
what
could
we
keep
worse
housed
than
your
hacks
and
your
pointers
worse
fed
than
your
hogs
and
your
sheep
yet
he
has
the
impudence
to
say
he
do
mean
me
grumbled
the
old
man
tregarva
winced
a
good
deal
as
if
he
knew
what
was
coming
next
and
then
looked
up
relieved
when
he
found
lancelot
had
omitted
a
stanza
which
i
shall
not
omit
our
daughters
with
babies
have
wandered
away
in
their
shame
if
your
misses
had
slept
squire
where
they
did
your
misses
might
do
the
same
your
lady
patch
hearts
that
are
breaking
with
handfuls
of
coals
and
rice
or
by
dealing
out
flannel
and
sheeting
a
little
below
cost
price
may
tire
of
the
gaol
and
the
workhouse
and
take
to
allotments
and
schools
but
you
run
up
a
debt
that
will
never
be
repaid
us
by
rules
in
the
season
of
shame
and
sadness
in
the
dark
and
dreary
day
when
scrofula
gout
and
madness
are
eating
your
race
away
to
kennels
and
liveried
varlets
you
have
cast
your
daughters
bread
and
worn
out
with
liquor
and
harlots
your
heir
at
your
feet
lies
dead
your
youngest
the
rector
lets
your
soul
rot
asleep
to
the
grave
you
will
find
in
your
god
the
protector
of
the
freeman
you
fancied
your
slave
looked
at
the
tuft
of
clover
and
wept
till
her
heart
grew
light
and
at
last
when
her
passion
was
over
went
wandering
into
the
night
the
merry
brown
hares
came
leaping
over
the
uplands
still
where
the
clover
and
corn
lay
sleeping
on
the
side
of
the
white
chalk
hill
sir
said
lancelot
can
not
suppose
that
this
latter
part
applies
to
you
or
your
family
it
do
it
applies
to
half
the
gentlemen
in
the
vale
and
that
just
as
bad
what
right
has
the
fellow
to
speak
evil
of
dignities
continued
he
quoting
the
only
text
in
the
bible
which
he
was
inclined
to
make
a
absolute
does
such
an
insolent
dog
deserve
what
do
he
deserve
i
say
think
quoth
lancelot
ambiguously
a
man
who
can
write
such
ballads
is
not
fit
to
be
your
gamekeeper
and
i
think
he
feels
so
himself
and
lancelot
stole
an
encouraging
look
at
tregarva
i
say
sir
the
keeper
answered
with
an
effort
i
leave
lavington
service
here
on
the
spot
once
and
for
all
that
you
may
do
my
fine
fellow
roared
the
squire
the
rascal
his
wages
steward
and
then
duck
him
soundly
in
the
pool
he
had
better
have
stayed
there
when
he
fell
in
last
i
had
indeed
i
think
but
i
take
none
of
your
money
the
day
harry
verney
was
buried
i
vowed
that
i
touch
no
more
of
the
wages
of
blood
i
going
sir
i
never
harmed
you
or
meant
a
hard
word
of
all
this
for
you
or
dreamt
that
you
or
any
living
soul
would
ever
see
it
but
what
i
seen
myself
in
spite
of
myself
i
set
down
here
and
am
not
ashamed
of
it
and
woe
he
went
on
with
an
almost
prophetic
solemnity
in
his
tone
and
gesture
to
those
who
do
these
things
and
woe
to
those
also
who
though
they
dare
not
do
them
themselves
yet
excuse
and
defend
them
who
dare
just
because
the
world
calls
them
gentlemen
and
not
tyrants
and
oppressors
he
turned
to
go
the
squire
bursting
with
passion
sprang
up
with
a
terrible
oath
turned
deadly
pale
staggered
and
dropped
senseless
on
the
floor
they
all
rushed
to
lift
him
up
tregarva
was
the
first
to
take
him
in
his
arms
and
place
him
tenderly
in
his
chair
where
he
lay
back
with
glassy
eyes
snoring
heavily
in
a
fit
of
apoplexy
for
god
sake
go
whispered
lancelot
to
the
keeper
wait
for
me
at
lower
whitford
i
must
see
you
before
you
stir
the
keeper
slipped
away
sadly
the
ladies
rushed
in
a
groom
galloped
off
for
the
doctor
met
him
luckily
in
the
village
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
squire
was
bled
and
put
to
bed
and
showed
hopeful
signs
of
returning
consciousness
and
as
argemone
and
lancelot
leant
together
over
his
pillow
her
hair
touched
her
lover
and
her
fragrant
breath
was
warm
upon
his
cheek
and
her
bright
eyes
met
his
and
drank
light
from
them
like
glittering
planets
gazing
at
their
sun
the
obnoxious
ballad
produced
the
most
opposite
effects
on
argemone
and
on
honoria
argemone
whose
reverence
for
the
formalities
and
the
respectabilities
of
society
never
very
great
had
of
late
utterly
vanished
before
lancelot
bad
counsel
could
think
of
it
only
as
a
work
of
art
and
conceived
the
most
romantic
longing
to
raise
tregarva
into
some
station
where
his
talents
might
have
free
play
to
honoria
on
the
other
hand
it
appeared
only
as
a
very
fierce
coarse
and
impertinent
satire
which
had
nearly
killed
her
father
true
there
was
not
a
thought
in
it
which
had
not
at
some
time
or
other
crossed
her
own
mind
but
that
made
her
dislike
all
the
more
to
see
those
thoughts
put
into
plain
english
that
very
intense
tenderness
and
excitability
which
made
her
toil
herself
among
the
poor
and
had
called
out
both
her
admiration
of
tregarva
and
her
extravagant
passion
at
his
danger
made
her
also
shrink
with
disgust
from
anything
which
thrust
on
her
a
painful
reality
which
she
could
not
remedy
she
was
a
staunch
believer
too
in
that
peculiar
creed
which
allows
every
one
to
feel
for
the
poor
except
themselves
and
considers
that
to
plead
the
cause
of
is
in
a
gentleman
the
perfection
of
virtue
but
in
a
himself
sheer
high
treason
and
so
beside
her
father
she
thought
of
the
keeper
only
as
a
scorpion
whom
she
had
helped
to
warm
into
life
and
sighing
assent
to
her
mother
when
she
said
wretch
and
he
seemed
so
pious
and
so
obliging
who
would
have
dreamt
that
he
was
such
a
horrid
radical
she
let
him
vanish
from
her
mind
and
out
of
whitford
priors
little
knowing
the
sore
weight
of
manly
love
he
bore
with
him
as
soon
as
lancelot
could
leave
the
priory
he
hastened
home
to
find
tregarva
the
keeper
had
packed
up
all
his
small
possessions
and
brought
them
down
to
lower
whitford
through
which
the
london
coach
passed
he
was
determined
to
go
to
london
and
seek
his
fortune
he
talked
of
turning
methodist
preacher
anything
that
came
to
hand
provided
that
he
could
but
keep
independence
and
a
clear
conscience
and
all
the
while
the
man
seemed
to
be
struggling
with
some
great
purpose
to
feel
that
he
had
a
work
to
do
though
what
it
was
and
how
it
was
to
be
done
he
did
not
see
am
a
tall
man
he
said
saul
the
son
of
kish
and
i
am
going
forth
like
him
sir
to
find
my
father
asses
i
doubt
i
sha
have
to
look
far
for
some
of
them
perhaps
said
lancelot
laughing
find
a
kingdom
be
so
sir
i
have
found
one
already
by
god
grace
and
i
much
mistaken
if
i
do
begin
to
see
my
way
towards
another
what
is
that
kingdom
of
god
on
earth
sir
as
well
as
in
heaven
come
it
must
sir
and
come
it
will
some
day
lancelot
shook
his
head
tregarva
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
said
we
not
taught
to
pray
for
the
coming
of
his
kingdom
sir
and
do
you
fancy
that
he
who
gave
the
lesson
would
have
set
all
mankind
to
pray
for
what
he
never
meant
should
come
to
pass
lancelot
was
silent
the
words
gained
a
new
and
blessed
meaning
in
his
eyes
he
said
time
at
least
of
their
fulfilment
is
far
enough
off
and
do
look
much
like
it
talking
of
that
tregarva
what
is
to
become
of
your
promise
to
take
me
to
a
village
wake
and
show
me
what
the
poor
are
like
can
keep
it
this
night
sir
there
is
a
revel
at
about
five
miles
up
the
river
will
you
go
with
a
discharged
gamekeeper
will
go
with
paul
tregarva
whom
i
honour
and
esteem
as
one
of
god
own
noblemen
who
has
taught
me
what
a
man
can
be
and
what
i
am
not
and
lancelot
grasped
the
keeper
hand
warmly
tregarva
brushed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
and
answered
i
said
in
my
haste
all
men
are
liars
and
god
has
just
given
me
the
lie
back
in
my
own
teeth
well
sir
we
will
go
you
are
not
ashamed
of
putting
on
a
for
if
you
go
as
a
gentleman
you
will
hear
no
more
of
them
than
a
hawk
does
of
a
covey
of
partridges
so
the
expedition
was
agreed
on
and
lancelot
and
the
keeper
parted
until
the
evening
but
why
had
the
vicar
been
rambling
on
all
that
morning
through
pouring
rain
on
the
top
of
the
london
coach
and
why
was
he
so
anxious
in
his
inquiries
as
to
the
certainty
of
catching
the
train
because
he
had
had
considerable
experience
in
that
wisdom
of
the
serpent
whose
combination
with
the
innocence
of
the
dove
in
somewhat
ultramontane
proportions
is
recommended
by
certain
late
leaders
of
his
school
he
had
made
up
his
mind
after
his
conversation
with
the
irishman
that
he
must
either
oust
lancelot
at
once
or
submit
to
be
ousted
by
him
and
he
was
now
on
his
way
to
lancelot
uncle
and
trustee
the
london
banker
he
knew
that
the
banker
had
some
influence
with
his
nephew
whose
whole
property
was
invested
in
the
bank
and
who
had
besides
a
deep
respect
for
the
kindly
and
upright
practical
mind
of
the
veteran
mammonite
and
the
vicar
knew
too
that
he
himself
had
some
influence
with
the
banker
whose
son
luke
had
been
his
pupil
at
college
and
when
the
young
man
lay
sick
of
a
dangerous
illness
brought
on
by
debauchery
into
which
weakness
rather
than
vice
had
tempted
him
the
vicar
had
watched
and
prayed
by
his
bed
nursed
him
as
tenderly
as
a
mother
and
so
won
over
his
better
heart
that
he
became
completely
reclaimed
and
took
holy
orders
with
the
most
earnest
intention
to
play
the
man
therein
as
repentant
rakes
will
often
do
half
from
a
mere
revulsion
to
asceticism
half
from
real
gratitude
for
their
deliverance
this
good
deed
had
placed
the
banker
in
the
vicar
debt
and
he
loved
and
reverenced
him
in
spite
of
his
dread
of
novelties
and
now
the
good
priest
was
going
to
open
to
him
just
as
much
of
his
heart
as
should
seem
fit
and
by
saying
a
great
deal
about
lancelot
evil
doings
opinions
and
companions
and
nothing
at
all
about
the
heiress
of
whitford
persuade
the
banker
to
use
all
his
influence
in
drawing
lancelot
up
to
london
and
leaving
a
clear
stage
for
his
plans
on
argemone
he
caught
the
he
arrived
safe
and
sound
in
town
but
what
he
did
there
must
be
told
in
another
chapter
chapter
xii
thunderstorm
the
second
weary
with
many
thoughts
the
vicar
came
to
the
door
of
the
bank
there
were
several
carriages
there
and
a
crowd
of
people
swarming
in
and
out
like
bees
round
a
entering
with
anxious
faces
and
returning
with
cheerful
ones
to
stop
and
talk
earnestly
in
groups
round
the
door
every
moment
the
mass
thickened
there
was
a
run
on
the
bank
an
old
friend
accosted
him
on
the
steps
have
you
too
money
here
then
here
nor
anywhere
else
thank
heaven
said
the
vicar
is
anything
wrong
not
you
heard
the
house
has
sustained
a
frightful
blow
this
week
railway
speculations
so
they
say
and
is
hardly
expected
to
survive
the
day
so
we
are
all
getting
our
money
out
as
fast
as
possible
way
of
binding
up
the
bruised
reed
eh
every
man
for
himself
a
man
is
under
no
obligation
to
his
banker
that
i
know
of
and
the
good
man
bustled
off
with
his
pockets
full
of
gold
the
vicar
entered
all
was
hurry
and
anxiety
the
clerks
seemed
trying
to
brazen
out
their
own
terror
and
shovelled
the
rapidly
lessening
gold
and
notes
across
the
counter
with
an
air
of
indignant
nonchalance
the
vicar
asked
to
see
the
principal
you
want
your
money
sir
answered
the
official
with
a
disdainful
look
want
no
money
i
must
see
smith
on
private
business
and
instantly
is
particularly
engaged
know
it
and
therefore
i
must
see
him
take
in
my
card
and
he
will
not
refuse
me
a
new
vista
had
opened
itself
before
him
he
was
ushered
into
a
private
room
and
as
he
waited
for
the
banker
he
breathed
a
prayer
for
what
that
his
own
will
might
be
done
a
very
common
style
of
petition
smith
entered
hurried
and
troubled
he
caught
the
vicar
eagerly
by
the
hand
as
if
glad
to
see
a
face
which
did
not
glare
on
him
with
the
cold
selfish
stamp
of
and
then
drew
back
again
afraid
to
commit
himself
by
any
sign
of
emotion
the
vicar
had
settled
his
plan
of
attack
and
determined
boldly
to
show
his
knowledge
of
the
banker
distress
am
very
sorry
to
trouble
you
at
such
an
unfortunate
moment
sir
and
i
will
be
brief
but
as
your
nephew
spiritual
pastor
he
knew
the
banker
was
a
stout
churchman
of
my
nephew
sir
no
fresh
misfortunes
i
hope
so
much
misfortune
sir
as
misconduct
i
might
say
frailty
but
frailty
which
may
become
ruinous
how
some
mesalliance
interrupted
smith
in
a
peevish
excited
tone
thought
there
was
some
heiress
on
the
tapis
at
least
so
i
heard
from
my
unfortunate
son
who
has
just
gone
over
to
rome
there
another
nothing
but
misfortunes
and
your
teaching
sir
by
the
bye
i
am
afraid
has
helped
me
to
that
one
over
to
rome
asked
the
vicar
slowly
sir
gone
to
rome
to
the
pope
sir
to
the
devil
sir
i
should
have
thought
you
likely
to
know
of
it
before
i
did
the
vicar
stared
fixedly
at
him
a
moment
and
burst
into
honest
tears
the
banker
was
moved
pon
my
honour
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
mean
to
be
rude
but
but
to
be
plain
with
a
clergyman
sir
so
many
things
coming
together
have
quite
unmanned
me
pooh
pooh
and
he
shook
himself
as
if
to
throw
off
a
weight
and
with
a
face
once
more
quiet
and
asked
now
my
dear
sir
what
of
my
nephew
for
that
young
lady
sir
of
whom
you
spoke
i
can
assure
you
once
for
all
as
her
clergyman
and
therefore
more
or
less
her
confidant
that
your
nephew
has
not
the
slightest
chance
or
hope
in
that
quarter
sir
you
will
not
throw
obstacles
in
the
way
sir
i
think
has
interposed
far
more
insuperable
obstacles
in
the
young
lady
own
heart
than
i
could
ever
have
done
your
nephew
character
and
opinions
i
am
sorry
to
say
are
not
such
as
are
likely
to
command
the
respect
and
affection
of
a
pure
and
pious
churchwoman
sir
what
is
he
turning
papist
too
am
afraid
sir
and
more
than
afraid
for
he
makes
no
secret
of
it
himself
that
his
views
tend
rather
in
the
opposite
direction
to
an
infidelity
so
subversive
of
the
commonest
principles
of
morality
that
i
expect
weekly
to
hear
of
some
unblushing
and
disgraceful
outrage
against
decency
committed
by
him
under
its
fancied
sanction
and
you
know
as
well
as
myself
the
double
danger
of
some
profligate
outbreak
which
always
attends
the
miseries
of
a
disappointed
earthly
passion
very
true
we
must
get
the
boy
out
of
the
way
sir
i
must
have
him
under
my
eye
so
sir
said
the
subtle
vicar
who
had
been
driving
at
this
very
point
much
better
for
him
to
be
here
using
his
great
talents
to
the
advantage
of
his
family
in
an
honourable
profession
than
to
remain
where
he
is
debauching
body
and
mind
by
hopeless
dreams
godless
studies
and
frivolous
excesses
do
you
return
sir
hour
hence
if
i
can
be
of
service
to
you
the
banker
paused
a
moment
are
a
gentleman
with
emphasis
on
the
word
as
such
i
can
trust
you
rather
as
a
clergyman
me
but
i
have
found
your
cloth
give
little
additional
cause
for
confidence
i
have
been
as
much
bitten
by
clergymen
i
have
seen
as
sharp
practice
among
them
in
money
matters
as
well
as
in
religious
squabbles
as
i
have
in
any
class
whether
it
is
that
their
book
education
leaves
them
very
often
ignorant
of
the
plain
rules
of
honour
which
bind
men
of
the
world
or
whether
their
zeal
makes
them
think
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
i
can
not
tell
but
said
the
vicar
half
smiling
half
severely
must
not
disparage
the
priesthood
before
a
priest
know
it
i
know
it
and
i
beg
your
pardon
but
if
you
knew
the
cause
i
have
to
complain
the
slipperiness
sir
of
one
staggering
parson
has
set
rolling
this
very
avalanche
which
gathers
size
every
moment
and
threatens
to
overwhelm
me
now
unless
that
idle
dog
lancelot
will
condescend
to
bestir
himself
and
help
me
the
vicar
heard
but
said
nothing
at
least
you
can
trust
he
answered
proudly
and
honestly
too
for
he
was
a
gentleman
by
birth
and
breeding
unselfish
and
chivalrous
to
a
fault
and
yet
when
he
heard
the
banker
words
it
was
as
if
the
inner
voice
had
whispered
to
him
art
the
man
do
you
go
down
again
asked
smith
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
writing
to
lancelot
when
you
were
announced
but
the
post
will
not
reach
him
till
at
noon
and
we
are
all
so
busy
here
that
i
have
no
one
whom
i
can
trust
to
carry
down
an
express
the
vicar
saw
what
was
coming
was
it
his
good
angel
which
prompted
him
to
interpose
not
send
a
parcel
by
rail
can
trust
the
rail
as
far
as
d
but
i
can
not
trust
those
coaches
if
you
could
do
me
so
great
a
kindness
will
i
can
start
by
the
one
train
and
by
ten
i
shall
be
in
whitford
you
certain
god
shall
please
i
am
certain
you
will
take
charge
of
a
letter
perhaps
too
you
could
see
him
yourself
and
tell
him
you
see
i
trust
you
with
everything
that
my
fortune
his
own
fortune
depends
on
his
being
here
morrow
morning
he
must
start
sir
tell
him
if
there
were
twenty
miss
lavingtons
in
whitford
or
he
is
a
ruined
man
the
letter
was
written
and
put
into
the
vicar
hands
with
a
hundred
entreaties
from
the
terrified
banker
a
cab
was
called
and
the
clergyman
rattled
off
to
the
railway
terminus
said
he
to
himself
has
indeed
blessed
my
errand
giving
as
always
exceeding
abundantly
more
than
we
are
able
to
ask
or
think
for
some
weeks
at
least
this
poor
lamb
is
safe
from
the
destroyer
clutches
i
must
improve
to
the
utmost
those
few
precious
days
in
strengthening
her
in
her
holy
purpose
but
after
all
he
will
return
daring
and
cunning
as
ever
and
then
will
not
the
fascination
recommence
and
as
he
mused
a
little
fiend
passed
by
and
whispered
he
comes
up
he
is
a
ruined
man
it
was
friday
and
the
vicar
had
thought
it
a
fit
preparation
for
so
important
an
errand
to
taste
no
food
that
day
weakness
and
hunger
joined
to
the
roar
and
bustle
of
london
had
made
him
excited
nervous
unable
to
control
his
thoughts
or
fight
against
a
stupifying
headache
and
his
will
punished
him
by
yielding
him
up
an
easy
prey
to
his
own
fancies
he
thought
he
were
ruined
after
all
it
would
be
well
for
god
cause
the
lavingtons
at
least
would
find
no
temptation
in
his
wealth
and
argemone
she
is
too
proud
too
luxurious
to
marry
a
beggar
she
might
embrace
a
holy
poverty
for
the
sake
of
her
own
soul
but
for
the
gratification
of
an
earthly
passion
never
base
and
carnal
delights
would
never
tempt
her
so
far
alas
poor
pedant
among
all
that
thy
books
taught
thee
they
did
not
open
to
thee
much
of
the
depths
of
that
human
heart
which
thy
dogmas
taught
thee
to
despise
as
diabolic
again
the
little
fiend
whispered
he
comes
up
he
is
a
ruined
man
what
if
he
is
thought
the
vicar
are
a
curse
and
poverty
a
blessing
is
it
not
his
wealth
which
is
ruining
his
soul
idleness
and
fulness
of
bread
have
made
him
what
he
is
a
luxurious
and
dreamer
battening
on
his
own
fancies
were
it
not
rather
a
boon
to
him
to
take
from
him
the
root
of
all
evil
most
true
vicar
and
yet
the
devil
was
at
that
moment
transforming
himself
into
an
angel
of
light
for
thee
but
the
vicar
was
yet
honest
if
he
had
thought
that
by
cutting
off
his
right
hand
he
could
have
saved
lancelot
soul
by
canonical
methods
of
course
for
who
would
wish
to
save
souls
in
any
other
he
would
have
done
it
without
hesitation
again
the
little
fiend
whispered
he
comes
up
he
is
a
ruined
man
a
terrible
sensation
seized
why
should
he
give
the
letter
night
promised
whispered
the
inner
voice
i
did
not
promise
exactly
in
so
many
words
that
is
i
only
said
i
would
be
at
home
if
god
pleased
and
what
if
god
should
not
please
i
promised
for
his
good
what
if
on
second
thoughts
it
should
be
better
for
him
not
to
keep
my
promise
a
moment
afterwards
he
tossed
the
temptation
from
him
indignantly
but
back
it
came
at
every
gaudy
shop
at
every
manufactory
at
the
face
of
every
anxious
victim
of
mammon
of
every
sturdy
cheerful
artisan
the
fiend
winked
and
pointed
crying
what
if
he
be
ruined
look
at
the
thousands
who
have
and
are
miserable
at
the
millions
who
have
not
and
are
no
sadder
than
their
own
tyrants
again
and
again
he
thrust
the
thought
from
him
but
more
and
more
weakly
his
whole
frame
shook
the
perspiration
stood
on
his
forehead
as
he
took
his
railway
ticket
his
look
was
so
haggard
and
painful
that
the
clerk
asked
him
whether
he
were
ill
the
train
was
just
starting
he
threw
himself
into
a
carriage
he
would
have
locked
himself
in
if
he
could
and
felt
an
inexpressible
relief
when
he
found
himself
rushing
past
houses
and
whirled
onward
whether
he
would
or
not
in
the
right
path
homeward
but
was
it
the
right
path
for
again
the
temptation
flitted
past
him
he
threw
himself
back
and
tried
to
ask
counsel
of
one
above
but
there
was
no
answer
nor
any
that
regarded
his
heart
was
silent
and
dark
as
midnight
fog
why
should
there
have
been
an
answer
he
had
not
listened
to
the
voice
within
did
he
wish
for
a
miracle
to
show
him
his
duty
that
i
care
for
detection
he
said
to
himself
is
shame
to
me
is
it
not
a
glory
to
be
of
in
the
cause
of
god
how
can
the
world
appreciate
the
motives
of
those
who
are
not
of
the
world
the
divine
wisdom
of
the
serpent
at
once
the
saint
peculiar
weapon
and
a
part
of
his
peculiar
cross
when
men
call
him
a
deceiver
because
they
confound
forsooth
his
spiritual
subtlety
with
their
earthly
cunning
have
i
not
been
called
liar
hypocrite
jesuit
often
enough
already
to
harden
me
towards
bearing
that
name
once
again
that
led
him
into
sad
thoughts
of
his
last
few
years
career
of
the
friends
and
pupils
whose
secession
to
rome
had
been
attributed
to
his
hypocrisy
his
romanism
and
then
the
remembrance
of
poor
luke
smith
flashed
across
him
for
the
first
time
since
he
left
the
bank
must
see
him
he
said
to
himself
must
argue
with
him
face
to
face
who
knows
but
that
it
may
be
given
even
to
my
unworthiness
to
snatch
him
from
this
accursed
slough
and
then
he
remembered
that
his
way
home
lay
through
the
city
in
which
the
new
convert
parish
was
that
the
coach
stopped
there
to
change
horses
and
again
the
temptation
leapt
up
again
stronger
than
ever
under
the
garb
of
an
imperative
call
of
duty
he
made
no
determination
for
or
against
it
he
was
too
weak
in
body
and
mind
to
resist
and
in
a
half
sleep
broken
with
an
aching
terrified
sense
of
something
wanting
which
he
could
not
find
he
was
swept
down
the
line
got
on
the
coach
and
mechanically
almost
without
knowing
it
found
himself
set
down
at
the
city
of
a
and
the
coach
rattling
away
down
the
street
he
sprang
from
his
stupor
and
called
madly
after
it
ran
a
few
steps
might
as
well
try
to
catch
the
clouds
sir
said
the
ostler
should
make
up
their
minds
afore
they
gets
down
alas
so
thought
the
vicar
but
it
was
too
late
and
with
a
heavy
heart
he
asked
the
way
to
the
late
curate
house
thither
he
went
luke
smith
was
just
at
dinner
but
the
vicar
was
nevertheless
shown
into
the
bachelor
little
but
what
was
his
disgust
and
disappointment
at
finding
his
late
pupil
over
a
comfortable
opposite
a
burly
vulgar
man
with
a
narrow
rim
of
muslin
turned
down
over
his
stiff
cravat
of
whose
profession
there
could
be
no
doubt
dearest
sir
said
the
new
convert
springing
up
with
an
air
of
extreme
empressement
an
unexpected
pleasure
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
my
excellent
friend
padre
bugiardo
the
padre
rose
bowed
obsequiously
overwhelmed
with
delight
at
being
at
last
introduced
to
one
of
whom
he
had
heard
so
much
sat
down
again
and
poured
himself
out
a
bumper
of
sherry
while
the
vicar
commenced
making
the
best
of
a
bad
matter
by
joining
in
the
now
necessary
business
of
eating
he
had
not
a
word
to
say
for
himself
poor
luke
was
particularly
jovial
and
flippant
and
startlingly
unlike
his
former
self
the
padre
went
on
staring
out
of
the
window
and
talking
in
a
loud
forced
tone
about
the
astonishing
miracles
of
the
and
and
the
poor
vicar
finding
the
purpose
for
which
he
had
sacrificed
his
own
word
of
honour
utterly
frustrated
by
the
priest
presence
sat
silent
and
crestfallen
the
whole
evening
the
priest
had
no
intention
of
stirring
the
late
tried
to
outstay
his
new
rival
but
in
vain
the
padre
deliberately
announced
his
intention
of
taking
a
bed
and
the
vicar
with
a
heavy
heart
rose
to
go
to
his
inn
as
he
went
out
at
the
door
he
caught
an
opportunity
of
saying
one
word
to
the
convert
poor
luke
and
are
you
happy
tell
me
honestly
in
god
sight
tell
me
than
ever
i
was
in
my
life
no
more
physical
or
mental
now
these
good
priests
thoroughly
understand
poor
human
nature
i
can
assure
you
the
vicar
sighed
for
the
speech
was
evidently
meant
as
a
gentle
rebuke
to
himself
but
the
young
man
ran
on
half
laughing
know
how
you
and
the
rest
used
to
tell
us
what
a
sad
thing
it
was
that
we
were
all
cursed
with
consciences
what
a
fearful
miserable
burden
moral
responsibility
was
but
that
we
must
submit
to
it
as
an
inevitable
evil
now
that
burden
is
gone
thank
god
we
of
the
true
church
have
some
one
to
keep
our
consciences
for
us
the
padre
settles
all
about
what
is
right
or
wrong
and
we
slip
on
as
easily
as
hog
or
a
butterfly
said
the
vicar
bitterly
answered
luke
on
your
own
showing
are
clean
gainers
of
a
happy
life
here
not
to
mention
heaven
hereafter
god
bless
you
we
shall
soon
see
you
one
of
us
so
help
me
god
said
the
vicar
all
the
more
fiercely
because
he
was
almost
at
that
moment
of
the
young
man
opinion
the
vicar
stepped
out
into
the
night
the
rain
which
had
given
place
during
the
afternoon
to
a
bright
sun
and
clear
chilly
evening
had
returned
with
double
fury
the
wind
was
sweeping
and
howling
down
the
lonely
streets
and
lashed
the
rain
into
his
face
while
gray
clouds
were
rushing
past
the
moon
like
terrified
ghosts
across
the
awful
void
of
the
black
heaven
above
him
gaunt
poplars
groaned
and
bent
like
giants
cowering
from
the
wrath
of
heaven
yet
rooted
by
grim
necessity
to
their
place
of
torture
the
roar
and
tumult
without
him
harmonised
strangely
with
the
discord
within
he
staggered
and
strode
along
the
plashy
pavement
muttering
to
himself
at
intervals
for
the
soul
peace
of
mind
i
have
been
promising
them
all
my
life
to
others
have
i
found
them
myself
and
here
is
this
poor
boy
saying
that
he
has
gained
them
in
the
very
barbarian
superstition
which
i
have
been
anathematising
to
him
what
is
true
at
this
rate
what
is
false
is
anything
right
or
wrong
except
in
as
far
as
men
feel
it
to
be
right
or
wrong
else
whence
does
this
poor
fellow
peace
come
or
the
peace
of
many
a
convert
more
they
have
all
one
by
one
told
me
the
same
story
and
is
not
a
religion
to
be
known
by
its
fruits
are
they
not
right
in
going
where
they
can
get
peace
of
mind
certainly
vicar
if
peace
of
mind
be
the
summum
bonum
and
religion
is
merely
the
science
of
they
are
right
and
your
wisest
plan
will
be
to
follow
them
at
once
or
failing
that
to
apply
to
the
next
best
substitute
that
can
be
discovered
alcohol
and
opium
as
he
went
on
talking
wildly
to
himself
he
passed
the
union
workhouse
opposite
the
gate
under
the
lee
of
a
wall
some
twenty
men
women
and
children
were
huddled
together
on
the
bare
ground
they
had
been
refused
lodging
in
the
workhouse
and
were
going
to
pass
the
night
in
that
situation
as
he
came
up
to
them
coarse
jests
and
snatches
of
low
ghastly
as
the
laughter
of
lost
spirits
in
the
pit
mingled
with
the
feeble
wailings
of
some
child
of
shame
the
vicar
recollected
how
he
had
seen
the
same
sight
at
the
door
of
kensington
workhouse
walking
home
one
night
in
company
with
luke
smith
and
how
too
he
had
commented
to
him
on
that
fearful
sign
of
the
times
and
had
somewhat
unfairly
drawn
a
contrast
between
the
niggard
cruelty
of
protestantism
and
the
fancied
of
the
middle
age
what
wonder
if
his
pupil
had
taken
him
at
his
word
delighted
to
escape
from
his
own
thoughts
by
anything
like
action
he
pulled
out
his
purse
to
give
an
alms
there
was
no
silver
in
it
but
only
some
fifteen
or
twenty
sovereigns
which
he
that
day
received
as
payment
for
some
bitter
reviews
in
a
leading
religious
periodical
everything
that
night
seemed
to
shame
and
confound
him
more
as
he
touched
the
money
there
sprang
up
in
his
mind
in
an
instant
the
thought
of
the
articles
which
had
procured
it
by
one
of
those
terrible
searching
inspirations
in
which
the
light
which
lighteth
every
man
awakes
as
a
of
judgment
he
saw
them
and
his
own
heart
for
one
moment
as
they
were
their
blind
prejudice
their
reckless
imputations
of
motives
their
wilful
concealment
of
any
palliating
clauses
their
party
nicknames
given
without
a
shudder
at
the
terrible
accusations
which
they
conveyed
and
then
the
indignation
the
shame
the
reciprocal
bitterness
which
those
articles
would
excite
tearing
still
wider
the
bleeding
wounds
of
that
church
which
they
professed
to
defend
and
then
in
this
case
too
the
thought
rushed
across
him
if
i
should
have
been
wrong
and
my
adversary
right
what
if
i
have
made
the
heart
of
the
righteous
sad
whom
god
has
not
made
sad
i
to
have
been
dealing
out
heaven
thunders
as
if
i
were
infallible
i
who
am
certain
at
this
moment
of
no
fact
in
heaven
or
earth
except
my
own
untruth
god
who
am
i
that
i
should
judge
another
and
the
coins
seemed
to
him
like
the
price
of
blood
he
fancied
that
he
felt
them
to
his
hand
and
in
his
eagerness
to
get
rid
of
the
accursed
thing
he
dealt
it
away
fiercely
to
the
astonished
group
amid
whining
and
flattery
wrangling
and
ribaldry
and
then
not
daring
to
wait
and
see
the
use
to
which
his
money
would
be
put
hurried
off
to
the
inn
and
tried
in
uneasy
slumbers
to
forget
the
time
until
the
mail
passed
through
at
daybreak
on
its
way
to
whitford
chapter
xiii
the
village
revel
at
dusk
that
same
evening
the
two
had
started
for
the
village
fair
a
velveteen
a
pair
of
corduroy
trousers
and
a
waistcoat
furnished
by
tregarva
covered
with
flowers
of
every
imaginable
hue
tolerably
disguised
lancelot
who
was
recommended
by
his
conductor
to
keep
his
hands
in
his
pockets
as
much
as
possible
lest
their
delicacy
which
was
as
it
happened
not
very
remarkable
might
betray
him
as
they
walked
together
along
the
plashy
turnpike
road
overtaking
now
and
then
groups
of
two
or
three
who
were
out
on
the
same
errand
as
themselves
lancelot
could
not
help
remarking
to
the
keeper
how
superior
was
the
look
of
comfort
in
the
boys
and
young
men
with
their
ruddy
cheeks
and
smart
dresses
to
the
worn
and
haggard
appearance
of
the
elder
men
them
alone
poor
fellows
said
tregarva
wo
last
long
when
they
got
two
or
three
children
at
their
heels
they
look
as
thin
and
shabby
as
their
own
fathers
must
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
on
their
clothes
on
their
stomachs
too
sir
they
never
lay
by
a
farthing
and
i
do
see
how
they
can
when
their
paid
and
their
insides
are
well
filled
you
mean
to
say
that
they
actually
have
not
as
much
to
eat
after
they
marry
and
i
do
sir
they
get
no
more
wages
afterwards
round
here
and
have
four
or
five
to
clothe
and
feed
off
the
same
money
that
used
to
keep
one
and
that
sum
wo
take
long
to
work
out
i
think
do
they
not
in
some
places
pay
the
married
men
higher
wages
than
the
unmarried
a
worse
trick
still
sir
for
it
tempts
the
poor
thoughtless
boys
to
go
and
marry
the
first
girl
they
can
get
hold
of
and
it
do
want
much
persuasion
to
make
them
do
that
at
any
time
why
do
the
clergymen
teach
them
to
put
into
the
savings
banks
here
and
there
sir
says
what
he
can
though
it
of
very
little
use
besides
every
one
is
afraid
of
savings
banks
now
not
a
year
but
one
reads
of
some
breaking
and
the
lawyers
going
off
with
the
earnings
of
the
poor
and
if
they
did
youth
a
foolish
time
at
best
and
the
carnal
man
will
be
hankering
after
amusement
sir
amusement
no
wonder
said
lancelot
all
events
i
should
not
think
they
got
much
of
it
but
it
does
seem
strange
that
no
other
amusement
can
be
found
for
them
than
the
ca
they
read
ca
they
practise
light
and
interesting
handicrafts
at
home
as
the
german
peasantry
do
teach
sir
from
the
to
the
and
back
again
is
all
they
know
besides
sir
they
are
not
like
us
cornish
they
are
a
stupid
pigheaded
generation
at
the
best
these
south
countrymen
they
babies
who
want
the
parson
and
the
squire
to
be
leading
them
and
preaching
to
them
and
spurring
them
on
and
coaxing
them
up
every
moment
and
as
for
scholarship
sir
a
boy
leaves
school
at
nine
or
ten
to
follow
the
horses
and
between
that
time
and
his
he
forgets
every
word
he
ever
learnt
and
becomes
for
the
most
part
as
thorough
a
heathen
savage
at
heart
as
those
wild
indians
in
the
brazils
used
to
be
then
we
call
them
civilised
englishmen
said
lancelot
can
see
that
your
indian
is
a
savage
because
he
wears
skins
and
feathers
but
your
irish
cottar
or
your
english
labourer
because
he
happens
to
wear
a
coat
and
trousers
is
to
be
considered
a
civilised
man
the
way
of
the
world
sir
said
tregarva
carnal
judgment
according
to
the
sight
of
its
own
eyes
always
looking
at
the
outsides
of
things
and
men
sir
and
never
much
deeper
but
as
for
reading
sir
it
all
very
well
for
me
who
have
been
a
keeper
and
dawdled
about
like
a
gentleman
with
a
gun
over
my
arm
but
did
you
ever
do
a
good
day
in
your
life
if
you
had
man
or
boy
you
would
have
been
game
for
much
reading
when
you
got
home
you
do
just
what
these
poor
fellows
do
tumble
into
bed
at
eight
hardly
waiting
to
take
your
clothes
off
knowing
that
you
must
turn
up
again
at
five
the
next
morning
to
get
a
breakfast
of
bread
and
perhaps
a
dab
of
the
squire
dripping
and
then
back
to
work
again
and
so
on
day
after
day
sir
week
after
week
year
after
year
without
a
hope
or
a
chance
of
being
anything
but
what
you
are
and
only
too
thankful
if
you
can
get
work
to
break
your
back
and
catch
the
rheumatism
over
do
you
mean
to
say
that
their
labour
is
so
severe
and
incessant
only
god
blessing
if
it
is
incessant
sir
for
if
it
stops
they
starve
or
go
to
the
house
to
be
worse
fed
than
the
thieves
in
gaol
and
as
for
its
being
severe
there
many
a
boy
as
their
mothers
will
tell
you
comes
home
night
after
night
too
tired
to
eat
their
suppers
and
tumble
fasting
to
bed
in
the
same
foul
shirt
which
they
been
working
in
all
the
day
never
changing
their
rag
of
calico
from
week
end
to
week
end
or
washing
the
skin
that
under
it
once
in
seven
years
wonder
said
lancelot
such
a
life
of
drudgery
makes
them
brutal
and
reckless
wonder
indeed
sir
they
no
time
to
think
they
born
to
be
machines
and
machines
they
must
be
and
i
think
sir
he
added
bitterly
god
mercy
that
they
dare
think
it
god
mercy
that
they
do
feel
men
that
write
books
and
talk
at
elections
call
this
a
free
country
and
say
that
the
poorest
and
meanest
has
a
free
opening
to
rise
and
become
prime
minister
if
he
can
but
you
see
sir
the
misfortune
is
that
in
practice
he
ca
for
one
who
gets
into
a
gentleman
family
or
into
a
little
shop
and
so
saves
a
few
pounds
fifty
know
that
they
no
chance
before
them
but
born
live
from
hand
to
mouth
scraping
and
pinching
to
get
not
meat
and
beer
even
but
bread
and
potatoes
and
then
at
the
end
of
it
all
for
a
worthy
reward
of
parish
pay
or
the
workhouse
that
a
lively
hopeful
prospect
for
a
christian
man
said
lancelot
thought
this
new
was
to
stir
them
up
to
independence
sir
the
old
law
has
bit
too
deep
it
made
them
slaves
and
beggars
at
heart
it
taught
them
not
to
be
ashamed
of
parish
pay
to
demand
it
as
a
right
so
it
is
their
right
said
lancelot
god
name
if
a
country
is
so
that
it
can
not
find
its
own
citizens
in
work
it
is
bound
to
find
them
in
food
sir
maybe
god
knows
i
do
grudge
it
them
it
a
poor
pittance
at
best
when
they
have
got
it
but
do
you
see
sir
how
all
old
or
new
either
suck
the
independent
spirit
out
of
a
man
how
they
make
the
poor
wretch
reckless
how
they
tempt
him
to
spend
every
extra
farthing
in
amusement
then
he
is
always
tempted
to
say
to
himself
whatever
happens
to
me
the
parish
must
keep
me
if
i
am
sick
it
must
doctor
me
if
i
am
worn
out
it
must
feed
me
if
i
die
it
must
bury
me
if
i
leave
my
children
paupers
the
parish
must
look
after
them
and
they
be
as
well
off
with
the
parish
as
they
were
with
me
now
they
only
got
just
enough
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
and
the
parish
ca
give
them
less
than
that
what
the
use
of
cutting
myself
off
from
of
pleasure
here
and
there
i
not
saving
money
for
my
children
i
only
saving
the
farmers
rates
there
it
is
sir
said
tregarva
the
bottom
of
it
sir
i
only
saving
the
farmers
rates
let
us
eat
and
drink
for
morrow
we
die
do
see
my
way
out
of
it
said
lancelot
says
everybody
sir
but
i
should
have
thought
those
members
of
parliament
and
statesmen
and
university
scholars
have
been
set
up
in
the
high
places
out
of
the
wood
where
we
are
all
struggling
and
scrambling
just
that
they
might
see
their
way
out
of
it
and
if
they
do
sir
and
that
soon
as
sure
as
god
is
in
heaven
these
poor
fellows
will
cut
their
way
out
of
it
blindfolded
and
ignorant
as
they
are
said
lancelot
will
be
certain
to
cut
their
way
out
just
in
the
wrong
direction
not
so
sure
of
that
sir
said
tregarva
lowering
his
voice
is
written
that
there
is
one
who
hears
the
desire
of
the
poor
lord
thou
preparest
their
hearts
and
thine
ear
hearkeneth
thereto
to
help
the
fatherless
and
poor
unto
their
right
that
the
man
of
the
earth
be
no
more
exalted
against
them
you
are
talking
like
any
chartist
tregarva
i
sir
i
have
heard
much
scripture
quoted
among
them
myself
poor
fellows
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
sir
i
do
know
what
i
am
becoming
i
getting
half
mad
with
all
i
see
going
on
and
not
going
on
and
you
will
agree
sir
that
what
happened
this
day
ca
have
done
much
to
cool
my
temper
or
brighten
my
hopes
though
god
my
witness
there
no
spite
in
me
for
my
own
sake
but
what
makes
me
maddest
of
all
sir
is
to
see
that
everybody
sees
these
evils
except
just
the
men
who
can
cure
them
the
squires
and
the
clergy
surely
tregarva
there
are
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
clergymen
and
landlords
working
heart
and
soul
at
this
moment
to
better
the
condition
of
the
labouring
classes
sir
they
see
the
evils
and
yet
they
do
see
them
they
do
not
see
what
is
the
matter
with
the
poor
man
and
the
proof
of
it
is
sir
that
the
poor
have
no
confidence
in
them
they
take
their
alms
but
they
hardly
take
their
schooling
and
their
advice
they
wo
take
at
all
and
why
is
it
sir
because
the
poor
have
got
in
their
heads
in
these
days
a
strange
confused
fancy
maybe
but
still
a
deep
and
a
fierce
one
that
they
have
got
what
they
call
their
rights
if
you
were
to
raise
the
wages
of
every
man
in
this
country
from
nine
to
twelve
shillings
you
would
satisfy
them
at
least
the
only
ones
whom
you
would
satisfy
would
be
the
mere
hogs
among
them
who
as
long
as
they
can
get
a
full
stomach
care
for
nothing
else
in
heaven
name
do
they
want
asked
lancelot
hardly
know
yet
sir
but
they
know
well
what
they
do
want
the
question
with
them
sir
believe
me
is
not
so
much
how
shall
we
get
better
fed
and
better
housed
but
whom
shall
we
depend
upon
for
our
food
and
for
our
house
why
should
we
depend
on
the
will
and
fancy
of
any
man
for
our
rights
they
are
asking
ugly
questions
among
themselves
sir
about
what
those
two
words
rent
and
taxes
mean
and
about
what
that
same
strange
word
freedom
means
eight
or
wrong
they
got
the
thought
into
their
heads
and
it
growing
there
and
they
will
find
an
answer
for
it
depend
upon
it
sir
i
tell
you
a
truth
and
they
expect
a
change
you
will
hear
them
talk
of
it
sir
if
you
luck
all
expect
a
change
for
that
matter
said
lancelot
feeling
is
common
to
all
classes
and
parties
just
now
tregarva
took
off
his
hat
for
the
word
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
do
you
know
sir
i
long
at
times
that
i
did
agree
with
those
chartists
if
i
did
i
turn
lecturer
how
a
man
could
speak
out
then
if
he
saw
any
door
of
hope
any
way
of
salvation
for
these
poor
fellows
even
if
it
was
nothing
better
than
salvation
by
act
of
parliament
why
do
you
trust
the
truly
worthy
among
the
clergy
and
the
gentry
to
leaven
their
own
ranks
and
bring
all
right
in
time
sir
they
seem
to
be
going
the
way
only
to
make
things
worse
the
people
have
been
so
dependent
on
them
heretofore
that
they
have
become
thorough
beggars
you
can
have
no
knowledge
sir
of
the
whining
canting
deceit
and
lies
which
those
poor
miserable
labourers
wives
palm
on
charitable
ladies
if
they
were
angels
some
of
them
they
lock
up
their
purses
and
never
give
away
another
farthing
and
sir
these
and
these
clubs
and
clothing
clubs
and
these
heaps
of
money
which
are
given
away
all
make
the
matter
worse
and
worse
they
make
the
labourer
fancy
that
he
is
not
to
depend
upon
god
and
his
own
right
hand
but
on
what
his
wife
can
worm
out
of
the
good
nature
of
the
rich
why
sir
they
growl
as
insolently
now
at
the
parson
or
the
squire
wife
if
they
do
get
as
much
money
as
their
neighbours
as
they
used
to
at
the
parish
vestrymen
under
the
old
law
look
at
that
lord
vieuxbois
sir
as
sweet
a
gentleman
as
ever
god
made
it
used
to
do
me
good
to
walk
behind
him
when
he
came
over
here
shooting
just
to
hear
the
gentle
way
in
which
he
used
to
speak
to
every
old
soul
he
met
he
spends
his
whole
life
and
time
about
the
poor
i
hear
but
sir
as
sure
as
you
live
he
making
his
people
slaves
and
humbugs
he
does
see
sir
that
they
want
to
be
raised
bodily
out
of
this
miserable
state
to
be
brought
nearer
up
to
him
and
set
on
a
footing
where
they
can
shift
for
themselves
without
meaning
it
sir
all
his
boundless
charities
are
keeping
the
people
down
and
telling
them
they
must
stay
down
and
not
help
themselves
but
wait
for
what
he
gives
them
he
fats
sir
just
as
lord
minchampstead
fats
oxen
and
pigs
lancelot
could
not
help
thinking
of
that
amusingly
inconsistent
however
scene
in
coningsby
in
which
lyle
is
represented
as
trying
to
restore
independent
order
of
peasantry
by
making
them
the
receivers
of
public
alms
at
his
own
gate
as
if
they
had
been
serfs
or
vagabonds
and
not
citizens
of
modern
england
may
suit
the
lyles
of
this
age
thought
lancelot
make
the
people
constantly
and
visibly
comprehend
that
property
is
their
protector
and
their
friend
but
i
question
whether
it
will
suit
the
people
themselves
unless
they
can
make
property
understand
that
it
owes
them
something
more
definite
than
protection
saddened
by
this
conversation
which
had
helped
to
give
another
shake
to
the
complacency
with
which
lancelot
had
been
used
to
contemplate
the
world
below
him
and
look
on
its
evils
as
necessaries
ancient
and
fixed
as
the
universe
he
entered
the
village
fair
and
was
a
little
disappointed
at
his
first
glimpse
of
the
certainly
his
expectations
had
not
been
very
exalted
but
there
had
run
through
them
a
hope
of
something
melodramatic
dreams
of
dancing
and
athletic
games
somewhat
of
rivalry
of
the
corin
and
sylvia
school
or
failing
that
a
few
touchstones
and
audreys
some
genial
earnest
buffo
humour
here
and
there
but
there
did
not
seem
much
likelihood
of
it
two
or
three
apple
and
gingerbread
stalls
from
which
draggled
children
were
turning
slowly
and
wistfully
away
to
go
home
a
booth
full
of
trumpery
fairings
in
front
of
which
tawdry
girls
were
coaxing
maudlin
youths
with
faded
southernwood
in
their
another
long
low
booth
from
every
crevice
of
which
reeked
odours
of
stale
beer
and
smoke
by
courtesy
denominated
tobacco
to
the
treble
accompaniment
of
a
jigging
fiddle
and
a
tambourine
and
the
bass
one
of
grumbled
oaths
and
curses
within
these
were
the
means
of
relaxation
which
the
piety
freedom
and
civilisation
of
fourteen
centuries
from
hengist
to
queen
victoria
had
devised
and
made
possible
for
the
english
peasant
seems
very
little
here
to
see
said
lancelot
half
peevishly
think
sir
quoth
tregarva
very
thing
is
what
most
worth
seeing
lancelot
could
not
help
even
at
the
risk
of
detection
investing
capital
enough
in
and
gingerbread
to
furnish
the
urchins
around
with
the
material
for
a
whole
carnival
of
aches
and
he
felt
a
great
inclination
to
clear
the
in
a
like
manner
on
behalf
of
the
poor
bedizened
girls
round
but
he
was
afraid
of
the
jealousy
of
some
swain
the
of
the
young
girls
surprised
him
much
here
and
there
smiled
a
plump
rosy
face
enough
but
the
majority
seemed
utterly
wanting
in
grace
vigour
and
what
the
call
health
he
remarked
it
to
tregarva
the
keeper
smiled
mournfully
see
those
little
creatures
dragging
home
babies
in
arms
nearly
as
big
as
themselves
sir
that
and
bad
food
want
of
milk
especially
accounts
for
their
growing
up
no
bigger
than
they
do
and
as
for
their
sad
countenances
sir
most
of
them
must
carry
a
lighter
conscience
before
they
carry
a
brighter
face
do
you
mean
asked
lancelot
clergyman
who
enters
the
weddings
and
the
baptisms
knows
well
enough
what
i
mean
sir
but
we
go
into
that
booth
if
you
want
to
see
the
thick
of
it
sir
that
to
say
if
you
not
ashamed
hope
we
need
neither
of
us
do
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
there
and
as
for
seeing
i
begin
to
agree
with
you
that
what
makes
the
whole
thing
most
curious
is
its
intense
dulness
upon
earth
is
that
say
look
out
there
you
look
out
yourself
this
was
caused
by
a
violent
blow
across
the
shins
with
a
thick
stick
the
deed
of
certain
drunken
wiseacres
who
were
persisting
in
playing
in
the
dark
the
never
very
lucrative
game
of
three
sticks
a
penny
conducted
by
a
couple
of
gipsies
poor
fellows
there
was
one
excuse
for
them
it
was
the
only
thing
there
to
play
at
except
a
set
of
skittles
and
on
those
they
had
lost
their
money
every
saturday
night
for
the
last
seven
years
each
at
his
own
village
so
into
the
booth
they
turned
and
as
soon
as
lancelot
eyes
were
accustomed
to
the
reeking
atmosphere
he
saw
seated
at
two
long
temporary
tables
of
board
fifty
or
sixty
of
brethren
as
clergymen
call
them
in
their
sermons
wrangling
stupid
beery
with
sodden
eyes
and
drooping
lips
interspersed
with
more
girls
and
women
with
dirty
flowers
in
their
caps
whose
whole
business
seemed
to
be
to
cast
jealous
looks
at
each
other
and
defend
themselves
from
the
coarse
overtures
of
their
swains
lancelot
had
been
already
perfectly
astonished
at
the
foulness
of
language
which
prevailed
and
the
utter
absence
of
anything
like
chivalrous
respect
almost
of
common
decency
towards
women
but
lo
the
language
of
the
elder
women
was
quite
as
disgusting
as
that
of
the
men
if
not
worse
he
whispered
a
remark
on
the
point
to
tregarva
who
shook
his
head
the
sir
the
that
does
it
all
they
get
accustomed
there
from
their
childhood
to
hear
words
whose
very
meanings
they
should
know
and
the
older
teach
the
younger
ones
and
the
married
ones
are
worst
of
all
it
wears
them
out
in
body
sir
that
and
makes
them
brutes
in
soul
and
in
manners
do
they
give
it
up
why
do
the
respectable
ones
set
their
faces
against
it
ca
afford
it
sir
they
must
go
or
go
hungered
most
of
them
and
they
get
to
like
the
gossip
and
scandal
and
coarse
fun
of
it
while
their
children
are
left
at
home
to
play
in
the
roads
or
fall
into
the
fire
as
plenty
do
every
year
not
at
school
big
ones
are
kept
at
home
sir
to
play
at
nursing
those
little
ones
who
are
too
young
to
go
oh
sir
he
added
in
a
tone
of
deep
feeling
is
very
little
of
a
father
care
or
a
mother
love
that
a
labourer
child
knows
in
these
days
lancelot
looked
round
the
booth
with
a
hopeless
feeling
there
was
awkward
dancing
going
on
at
the
upper
end
he
was
too
much
sickened
to
go
and
look
at
it
he
began
examining
the
faces
and
foreheads
of
the
company
and
was
astonished
at
the
first
glance
by
the
lofty
and
ample
development
of
brain
in
at
least
one
half
there
were
intellects
there
or
rather
capacities
of
intellect
capable
surely
of
anything
had
not
the
promise
of
the
brow
been
almost
always
belied
by
the
loose
and
sensual
lower
features
they
were
evidently
rather
a
degraded
than
an
undeveloped
race
low
forehead
of
the
kabyle
and
koord
thought
lancelot
compensated
by
the
grim
sharp
lip
and
glittering
eye
which
prove
that
all
the
small
capabilities
of
the
man
have
been
called
out
into
clear
and
vigorous
action
but
here
the
very
features
themselves
both
by
what
they
have
and
what
they
want
testify
against
that
society
which
carelessly
wastes
her
most
precious
wealth
the
manhood
of
her
masses
tregarva
you
have
observed
a
good
many
things
did
you
ever
observe
whether
the
men
with
the
large
foreheads
were
better
than
the
men
with
the
small
ones
sir
i
know
what
you
are
driving
at
i
heard
of
that
fangled
notion
of
scholars
which
if
you
forgive
my
plain
speaking
expects
man
brains
to
do
the
work
of
god
grace
what
have
you
remarked
i
ever
saw
was
that
the
ones
were
the
greatest
blackguards
and
the
ones
the
greatest
rogues
lancelot
was
rebuked
but
not
surprised
he
had
been
for
some
time
past
suspecting
from
the
bitter
experience
of
his
own
heart
the
favourite
modern
theory
which
revives
the
of
alexandria
by
making
intellect
synonymous
with
virtue
and
then
jumbling
like
poor
bewildered
proclus
the
understanding
of
the
brain
with
the
pure
of
the
spirit
see
something
if
you
look
round
sir
a
great
deal
easier
to
explain
and
i
should
have
thought
a
great
deal
easier
to
want
of
wits
what
is
that
the
young
ones
are
from
their
fathers
and
still
more
from
their
grandfathers
look
at
those
three
or
four
old
grammers
talking
together
there
for
all
their
being
shrunk
with
age
and
weather
you
wo
see
such
men
anywhere
else
in
this
booth
it
was
too
true
lancelot
recollected
now
having
remarked
it
before
when
at
church
and
having
wondered
why
almost
all
the
youths
were
so
much
smaller
clumsier
and
than
their
elders
is
it
tregarva
food
worse
lodging
worse
nursing
and
i
sore
afraid
worse
blood
there
was
too
much
filthiness
and
drunkenness
went
on
in
the
old
not
to
leave
a
taint
behind
it
for
many
a
generation
the
prosperity
of
fools
shall
destroy
them
thought
lancelot
some
young
sturdy
lancashire
or
lothian
blood
to
put
new
life
into
the
old
frozen
south
saxon
veins
even
a
drop
of
the
warm
enthusiastic
celtic
would
be
better
than
none
perhaps
this
irish
immigration
may
do
some
good
after
all
perhaps
it
may
lancelot
let
us
hope
so
since
it
is
pretty
nearly
inevitable
sadder
and
sadder
lancelot
tried
to
listen
to
the
conversation
of
the
men
round
him
to
his
astonishment
he
hardly
understood
a
word
of
it
it
was
half
articulate
nasal
guttural
made
up
almost
entirely
of
vowels
like
the
speech
of
savages
he
had
never
before
been
struck
with
the
significant
contrast
between
the
sharp
articulation
the
vivid
and
varied
tones
of
the
gentleman
or
even
of
the
london
when
compared
with
the
coarse
growls
as
of
a
company
of
seals
which
he
heard
round
him
that
single
fact
struck
him
perhaps
more
deeply
than
any
it
connected
itself
with
many
of
his
physiological
fancies
it
was
the
parent
of
many
thoughts
and
plans
of
his
here
and
there
he
could
distinguish
a
half
sentence
an
old
shrunken
man
opposite
him
was
drawing
figures
in
the
spilt
beer
with
his
stem
and
discoursing
of
the
glorious
times
before
the
great
war
there
was
more
food
than
there
were
mouths
and
more
work
than
there
were
hands
human
nature
thought
lancelot
as
he
tried
to
follow
one
of
those
unintelligible
discussions
about
the
relative
prices
of
the
loaf
and
the
bushel
of
flour
which
ended
as
usual
in
more
swearing
and
more
quarrelling
and
more
beer
to
make
it
up
human
nature
always
looking
back
as
the
german
sage
says
to
some
fancied
golden
age
never
looking
forward
to
the
real
one
which
is
coming
i
say
vather
drawled
out
some
one
say
there
a
sight
more
money
in
england
now
than
there
was
afore
the
booy
said
the
old
man
its
got
into
too
few
hands
thought
lancelot
a
glimpse
of
practical
sense
at
least
and
a
pedlar
who
sat
next
him
a
bold
bully
from
the
potteries
hazarded
a
joke
all
along
of
this
new
farming
they
used
to
spread
the
money
broadcast
but
now
they
drills
it
all
in
one
place
like
under
their
fancy
plants
and
we
poor
chaps
gets
none
this
garland
of
fancies
was
received
with
great
applause
whereat
the
pedlar
emboldened
proceeded
to
observe
mysteriously
that
took
a
beating
but
horses
kicked
at
it
and
that
they
found
out
that
in
staffordshire
long
ago
you
want
a
good
chartist
lecturer
down
here
my
covies
to
show
you
donkeys
of
labouring
men
that
you
have
got
iron
on
your
heels
if
you
only
know
how
to
use
it
what
the
use
of
rioting
asked
some
one
querulously
if
you
do
riot
the
farmers
will
starve
you
if
we
do
they
turn
sodgers
yeomanry
as
they
call
it
though
there
ai
a
yeoman
among
them
in
these
parts
and
then
they
takes
sword
and
kills
us
so
riot
or
none
they
has
it
all
their
own
way
lancelot
heard
many
more
scraps
of
this
sort
he
was
very
much
struck
with
their
dread
of
violence
it
did
not
seem
cowardice
it
was
not
loyalty
the
english
labourer
has
fallen
below
the
capability
of
so
spiritual
a
feeling
lancelot
had
found
out
that
already
it
could
not
be
apathy
for
he
heard
nothing
but
complaint
upon
complaint
bandied
from
mouth
to
mouth
the
whole
evening
they
seemed
rather
sunk
too
low
in
body
and
mind
too
stupefied
and
spiritless
to
follow
the
example
of
the
manufacturing
districts
above
all
they
were
too
it
is
not
mere
starvation
which
goads
the
leicester
weaver
to
madness
it
is
starvation
with
education
an
empty
stomach
and
a
cultivated
even
though
miscultivated
mind
at
that
instant
a
huge
hulking
rolled
into
the
booth
roaring
dolefully
the
end
of
a
song
with
a
punctuation
of
his
own
invention
maak
me
a
lady
zo
vine
to
be
zyure
and
vaithfully
love
me
although
i
lancelot
would
have
laughed
heartily
at
him
anywhere
else
but
the
whole
scene
was
past
a
jest
and
a
gleam
of
pathos
and
tenderness
seemed
to
shine
even
from
that
doggerel
a
vista
as
it
were
of
true
genial
nature
in
the
far
distance
but
as
he
looked
round
again
hope
he
thought
its
realisation
arcadian
dreams
of
pastoral
innocence
and
graceful
industry
i
suppose
are
to
be
henceforth
monopolised
by
the
stage
or
the
boudoir
never
so
help
me
god
the
ursine
howls
of
the
seemed
to
have
awakened
the
spirit
of

in
the

cried
a
dozen
voices
to
an
impish
gipsy
boy
of
some
thirteen
years
old

gi
us
mary
shall
make
a
girls
cry
quoth
blackbird
with
a
grin
good
too
they
likes
it
zing
away
and
the
boy
began
in
a
broad
country
twang
which
could
not
overpower
the
sad
melody
of
the
air
or
the
rich
sweetness
of
his
voice
mary
walked
sadly
down
through
the
green
clover
and
sighed
as
she
looked
at
the
babe
at
her
breast
my
roses
are
faded
my
false
love
a
rover
the
green
graves
they
call
me
home
to
your
rest
by
rode
a
soldier
in
gorgeous
arraying
and
where
is
your
my
fair
maid
he
cried
i
had
a
by
false
man
betraying
nor
token
of
love
but
this
babe
at
my
side
tho
gold
could
not
buy
me
sweet
words
could
deceive
me
so
faithful
and
lonely
till
death
i
must
roam
oh
mary
sweet
mary
look
up
and
forgive
me
with
wealth
and
with
glory
your
true
love
comes
home
so
give
me
my
own
babe
those
soft
arms
adorning
i
wed
you
and
cherish
you
never
to
stray
for
it
many
a
dark
and
a
wild
cloudy
morning
turns
out
by
the
a
sunshiny
day
bad
moral
that
sir
whispered
tregarva
than
none
answered
lancelot
well
if
you
are
right
sir
for
you
hear
no
other
the
keeper
spoke
truly
in
a
dozen
different
songs
more
or
less
coarsely
but
in
general
with
a
dash
of
pathetic
sentiment
the
same
case
of
lawless
love
was
embodied
it
seemed
to
be
their
only
notion
of
the
romantic
now
and
then
there
was
a
poaching
song
then
one
of
the
lowest
flash
london
school
filth
and
all
was
roared
in
chorus
in
presence
of
the
women
am
afraid
that
you
do
not
thank
me
for
having
brought
you
to
any
place
so
unfit
for
a
gentleman
said
tregarva
seeing
lancelot
sad
face
it
is
so
unfit
for
a
gentleman
therefore
i
do
thank
you
it
is
right
to
know
what
one
own
flesh
and
blood
are
doing
to
that
song
sir
that
an
old
one
i
did
think
they
get
on
to
singing
that
the
blackbird
was
again
on
the
table
but
seemed
this
time
disinclined
to
exhibit
wi
un
boy
it
wai
burn
thy
mouth
be
afeard
who
there
he
pointed
to
tregarva
there
was
a
fierce
growl
round
the
room
am
no
keeper
shouted
tregarva
starting
up
was
turned
off
this
morning
for
speaking
my
mind
about
the
squires
and
now
i
one
of
you
to
live
and
die
this
answer
was
received
with
a
murmur
of
applause
and
a
fellow
in
a
scarlet
merino
neckerchief
three
waistcoats
and
a
fancy
who
had
been
eyeing
lancelot
for
some
time
sidled
up
behind
them
and
whispered
in
tregarva
ear
you
like
an
engagement
in
our
line
young
man
and
your
friend
there
he
seems
a
sporting
gent
we
could
show
him
very
pretty
shooting
tregarva
answered
by
the
first
and
last
oath
lancelot
ever
heard
from
him
and
turning
to
him
as
the
rascal
sneaked
off
a
poaching
crimp
from
london
sir
tempting
these
poor
boys
to
sin
and
deceit
and
drunkenness
and
theft
and
the
hulks
fancy
i
saw
him
somewhere
the
night
of
our
row
you
understand
do
i
sir
but
there
no
use
talking
of
it
blackbird
was
by
this
time
prevailed
on
to
sing
and
burst
out
as
melodious
as
ever
while
all
heads
were
cocked
on
one
side
in
delighted
attention
zeed
a
vire
o
monday
night
a
vire
both
great
and
high
but
i
wool
not
tell
you
where

why

brood
mare
zays
i
you
and
your
stock
may
roast
vor
aught
us
poor
chaps
care
boys
coorus
and
the
chorus
burst
out
here
a
curse
on
varmers
all
as
rob
and
grind
the
poor
to
the
fruit
of
all
their
works
in
for
blind
owld

rights
our
bits
of
chips
and
sticks
till
poor
folks
now
ca
warm
their
hands
except
by
varmer
ricks
etc
and
again
the
boy
delicate
voice
rung
out
the
ferocious
chorus
with
something
lancelot
fancied
of
fiendish
exultation
and
every
worn
face
lighted
up
with
a
coarse
laugh
that
indicated
no
malice
but
also
no
mercy
lancelot
was
sickened
and
rose
to
go
as
he
turned
his
arm
was
seized
suddenly
and
firmly
he
looked
round
and
saw
a
coarse
handsome
girl
looking
intently
into
his
face
he
shook
her
angrily
off
need
be
so
proud
smith
i
had
my
hand
on
the
arm
of
as
good
as
you
ah
you
need
start
i
know
you
i
know
you
i
say
well
enough
you
used
to
be
with
him
where
is
he
do
you
mean
answered
the
girl
with
a
fierce
surprised
look
as
if
there
could
be
no
one
else
in
the
world
bracebridge
whispered
tregarva
he
it
is
and
now
walk
further
off
bloodhound
and
let
me
speak
to
smith
he
is
in
norway
she
ran
on
eagerly
will
he
be
back
when
do
you
want
to
know
asked
lancelot
will
he
be
back
she
kept
on
fiercely
repeating
the
question
and
then
burst
out
you
gentlemen
all
cowards
you
are
all
in
a
league
against
us
poor
girls
you
can
hunt
alone
when
you
betray
us
and
lie
fast
enough
then
but
when
we
come
for
justice
you
all
herd
together
like
a
flock
of
rooks
and
turn
so
delicate
and
honourable
all
of
a
sudden
to
each
other
when
will
he
be
back
i
say
a
month
answered
lancelot
who
saw
that
something
really
important
lay
behind
the
girl
wildness
late
she
cried
wildly
clapping
her
hands
together
late
here
tell
him
you
saw
me
tell
him
you
saw
mary
tell
him
where
and
in
what
a
pretty
place
too
for
maid
master
or
man
what
are
you
doing
here
is
that
to
you
my
good
girl
tell
him
you
saw
me
here
and
tell
him
when
next
he
hears
of
me
it
will
be
in
a
very
different
place
she
turned
and
vanished
among
the
crowd
lancelot
almost
ran
out
into
the
night
into
a
triad
of
fights
two
drunken
men
two
jealous
wives
and
a
brute
who
struck
a
poor
thin
woman
for
trying
to
coax
him
home
lancelot
rushed
up
to
interfere
but
a
man
seized
his
uplifted
arm
only
beat
her
all
the
more
when
he
getteth
home
has
stood
that
every
saturday
night
for
the
last
seven
years
to
my
knowledge
said
tregarva
worse
too
at
times
god
is
there
no
escape
for
her
from
her
tyrant
sir
it
only
you
gentlefolks
who
can
afford
such
luxuries
your
poor
man
may
be
tied
to
a
harlot
or
your
poor
woman
to
a
ruffian
but
once
done
done
for
ever
thought
lancelot
english
have
a
characteristic
way
of
proving
the
holiness
of
the
marriage
tie
the
angel
of
justice
and
pity
can
not
sever
it
only
the
stronger
demon
of
money
their
way
home
lay
over
ashy
down
a
lofty
chalk
promontory
round
whose
foot
the
river
made
a
sudden
bend
as
they
paced
along
over
the
dreary
hedgeless
stubbles
they
both
started
as
a
ghostly
ha
ha
rang
through
the
air
over
their
heads
and
was
answered
by
a
like
cry
faint
and
distant
across
the
wolds
those
at
least
so
i
hope
said
tregarva
be
round
again
in
a
minute
and
again
right
between
them
and
the
clear
cold
moon
ha
ha
resounded
over
their
heads
they
gazed
up
into
the
cloudless
sky
but
there
was
no
sign
of
living
thing
an
old
sign
to
me
quoth
tregarva
grant
that
i
may
remember
it
in
this
black
day
of
mine
so
asked
lancelot
should
not
have
fancied
you
a
superstitious
man
go
for
nothing
sir
and
what
my
forefathers
believed
in
i
am
not
going
to
be
conceited
enough
to
disbelieve
in
a
hurry
but
if
you
heard
my
story
you
would
think
i
had
reason
enough
to
remember
that
devil
laugh
up
there
me
hear
it
then
sir
it
may
be
a
long
story
to
you
but
it
was
a
short
one
to
me
for
it
was
the
making
of
me
out
of
hand
there
and
then
blessed
be
god
but
if
you
will
have
it
i
will
have
it
friend
tregarva
quoth
lancelot
lighting
his
cigar
was
about
sixteen
years
old
just
after
i
came
home
from
the
brazils
have
you
been
in
the
brazils
and
i
have
sir
for
three
years
and
one
thing
i
learnt
there
at
least
that
worth
going
for
that
the
garden
of
eden
must
have
been
like
but
those
brazils
under
god
were
the
cause
of
my
being
here
for
my
father
who
was
a
lost
all
his
money
there
by
no
man
fault
but
his
own
and
not
his
either
the
world
would
say
and
when
we
came
back
to
cornwall
he
could
not
stand
the
bal
work
nor
i
neither
out
of
that
burning
sun
sir
to
come
home
here
and
work
in
the
levels
up
to
our
knees
in
warm
water
with
the
thermometer
at
degrees
and
then
up
a
thousand
feet
of
ladder
to
grass
reeking
wet
with
heat
and
find
the
easterly
sleet
driving
across
those
open
he
could
stand
it
sir
few
stand
it
long
even
of
those
who
stay
in
cornwall
we
miners
have
a
short
lease
of
life
consumption
and
strains
break
us
down
before
we
fifty
how
came
you
here
doctor
told
my
father
and
me
too
sir
that
we
must
give
up
mining
or
die
of
decline
so
he
came
up
here
to
a
sister
of
his
that
was
married
to
the
squire
gardener
and
here
he
died
and
the
squire
god
bless
him
and
forgive
him
took
a
fancy
to
me
and
made
me
and
i
loved
the
life
for
it
took
me
among
the
woods
and
the
rivers
where
i
could
think
of
the
brazils
and
fancy
myself
back
again
but
must
talk
of
that
where
god
wills
is
all
right
and
it
is
a
fine
life
for
reading
and
thinking
a
gamekeeper
for
it
an
idle
life
at
best
now
that
over
he
added
with
a
sigh
the
lord
has
fulfilled
his
words
to
me
that
he
spoke
the
first
night
that
ever
i
heard
a
cry
on
earth
can
you
mean
asked
lancelot
deeply
interested
sir
it
was
a
wild
whirling
gray
night
with
the
air
full
of
sleet
and
rain
and
my
father
sent
me
over
to
redruth
town
to
bring
home
some
trade
or
other
and
as
i
came
back
i
got
blinded
with
the
sleet
and
i
lost
my
way
across
the
moors
you
know
those
cornish
sir
then
they
are
burrowed
like
a
with
old
shafts
you
ca
go
in
some
places
ten
yards
without
finding
great
ghastly
black
holes
covered
in
with
furze
and
weeds
and
bits
of
rotting
timber
and
when
i
was
a
boy
i
could
keep
from
them
something
seemed
to
draw
me
to
go
and
peep
down
and
drop
pebbles
in
to
hear
them
rattle
against
the
sides
fathoms
below
till
they
plumped
into
the
ugly
black
still
water
at
the
bottom
and
i
used
to
be
always
after
them
in
my
dreams
when
i
was
young
falling
down
them
down
down
all
night
long
till
i
woke
screaming
for
i
fancied
they
were
hell
mouth
every
one
of
them
and
it
stands
to
reason
sir
we
miners
hold
that
the
lake
of
fire
ca
be
far
below
for
we
find
it
grow
warmer
and
warmer
and
warmer
the
farther
we
sink
a
shaft
and
the
learned
gentlemen
have
proved
sir
that
it
not
the
blasting
powder
nor
the
men
breaths
that
heat
the
mine
lancelot
could
but
listen
sir
i
got
into
a
great
full
of
deads
those
are
the
they
throw
out
of
the
shafts
where
no
man
in
his
senses
dare
go
forward
or
back
in
the
dark
for
fear
of
the
shafts
and
the
wind
and
the
snow
were
so
sharp
they
made
me
quite
stupid
and
sleepy
and
i
knew
if
i
stayed
there
i
should
be
frozen
to
death
and
if
i
went
on
there
were
the
shafts
ready
to
swallow
me
up
and
what
with
fear
and
the
howling
and
raging
of
the
wind
i
was
like
a
mazed
boy
sir
and
i
knelt
down
and
tried
to
pray
and
then
in
one
moment
all
the
evil
things
i
ever
done
and
the
bad
words
and
thoughts
that
ever
crossed
me
rose
up
together
as
clear
as
one
page
of
a
and
i
knew
that
if
i
died
that
minute
i
should
go
to
hell
and
then
i
saw
through
the
ground
all
the
water
in
the
shafts
glaring
like
blood
and
all
the
sides
of
the
shafts
fierce
as
if
hell
was
coming
up
and
i
heard
the
knockers
knocking
or
thought
i
heard
them
as
plain
as
i
hear
that
grasshopper
in
the
hedge
now
are
the
knockers
are
the
ghosts
the
miners
hold
of
the
old
jews
sir
that
crucified
our
lord
and
were
sent
for
slaves
by
the
roman
emperors
to
work
the
mines
and
we
find
their
old
which
we
call
jews
houses
and
their
blocks
of
tin
at
the
bottom
of
the
great
bogs
which
we
call
jews
tin
and
there
a
town
among
us
too
which
we
call
but
the
old
name
was
marazion
that
means
the
bitterness
of
zion
they
tell
me
is
it
so
sir
believe
it
is
said
lancelot
utterly
puzzled
in
this
new
field
of
romance
bitter
work
it
was
for
them
no
doubt
poor
souls
we
used
to
break
into
the
old
shafts
and
adits
which
they
had
made
and
find
old
pickaxes
that
crumbled
to
pieces
when
we
brought
them
to
grass
and
they
say
that
if
a
man
will
listen
sir
of
a
still
night
about
those
old
shafts
he
may
hear
the
ghosts
of
them
at
working
knocking
and
picking
as
clear
as
if
there
was
a
man
at
work
in
the
next
level
it
may
be
all
an
old
fancy
i
suppose
it
is
but
i
believed
it
when
i
was
a
boy
and
it
helped
the
work
in
me
that
night
but
i
go
on
with
my
story
on
with
what
you
like
said
lancelot
sir
i
was
down
on
my
knees
among
the
and
i
tried
to
pray
but
i
was
too
frightened
for
i
felt
the
beast
i
had
been
sir
and
i
expected
the
ground
to
open
and
let
me
down
every
moment
and
then
there
came
by
over
my
head
a
rushing
and
a
cry
ha
ha
ha
paul
it
said
and
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
devils
and
witches
were
out
on
the
wind
at
my
misery
oh
i
mend
i
repent
i
said
indeed
i
will
and
again
it
came
back
ha
ha
ha
paul
it
said
i
knew
afterwards
that
it
was
a
bird
but
the
lord
sent
it
to
me
for
a
messenger
no
less
that
night
and
i
shook
like
a
reed
in
the
water
and
then
all
at
once
a
thought
struck
me
why
should
i
be
a
coward
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
shafts
or
devils
or
hell
or
anything
else
if
i
am
a
miserable
sinner
there
one
died
for
me
i
owe
him
love
not
fear
at
all
i
not
be
frightened
into
doing
right
that
a
rascally
reason
for
repentance
and
so
it
was
sir
that
i
rose
up
like
a
man
and
said
to
the
lord
jesus
right
out
into
the
black
dumb
air
if
you
be
on
my
side
this
night
good
lord
that
died
for
me
i
be
on
your
side
for
ever
villain
as
i
am
if
i
worth
making
any
use
of
and
there
and
then
sir
i
saw
a
light
come
over
the
bushes
brighter
and
brighter
up
to
me
and
there
rose
up
a
voice
within
me
and
spoke
to
me
quite
soft
and
sweet
fear
not
paul
for
i
will
send
thee
far
hence
unto
the
gentiles
and
what
more
happened
i
ca
tell
for
when
i
woke
i
was
safe
at
home
my
father
and
his
folk
had
been
out
with
lanterns
after
me
and
there
they
found
me
sure
enough
in
a
dead
faint
on
the
ground
but
this
i
know
sir
that
those
words
have
never
left
my
mind
since
for
a
day
together
and
i
know
that
they
will
be
fulfilled
in
me
this
tide
or
never
lancelot
was
silent
a
few
minutes
suppose
tregarva
that
you
would
call
this
your
conversion
should
call
it
one
sir
because
it
was
one
me
now
honestly
did
any
real
practical
change
in
your
behaviour
take
place
after
that
night
much
sir
as
if
you
put
a
soul
into
a
hog
and
told
him
that
he
was
a
gentleman
son
and
if
every
time
he
remembered
that
he
got
spirit
enough
to
conquer
his
hoggishness
and
behave
like
a
man
till
the
hoggishness
died
out
of
him
and
the
manliness
grew
up
and
bore
fruit
in
him
more
and
more
each
day
lancelot
half
understood
him
and
sighed
a
long
silence
followed
as
they
paced
on
past
lonely
farmyards
from
which
the
rich
was
draining
across
the
road
in
foul
black
streams
festering
and
steaming
in
the
chill
night
air
lancelot
sighed
as
he
saw
the
fruitful
materials
of
food
running
to
waste
and
thought
of
the
cry
and
then
he
looked
across
to
the
miles
of
brown
moorland
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
that
lay
idle
and
dreary
under
the
autumn
moon
except
where
here
and
there
a
squatter
cottage
and
rood
of
fruitful
garden
gave
the
lie
to
the
laziness
and
ignorance
of
man
who
pretends
that
it
is
not
worth
his
while
to
cultivate
the
soil
which
god
has
given
him
heavens
he
thought
our
forefathers
had
no
more
enterprise
than
modern
landlords
where
should
we
all
have
been
at
this
moment
everywhere
waste
waste
of
manure
waste
of
land
waste
of
muscle
waste
of
brain
waste
of
population
and
we
call
ourselves
the
workshop
of
the
world
as
they
passed
through
the
miserable
of
ashy
they
saw
a
light
burning
in
window
at
the
door
below
a
haggard
woman
was
looking
anxiously
down
the
village
the
matter
mistress
cooper
asked
tregarva
grane
poor
girl
lying
sick
of
the
fever
the
lord
help
her
and
the
boy
died
of
it
last
week
we
sent
for
the
doctor
this
afternoon
and
he
busy
with
a
poor
soul
that
in
her
trouble
and
now
we
sent
down
to
the
squire
and
the
young
ladies
god
bless
them
sent
answer
they
come
themselves
straightway
wonder
you
have
typhus
here
said
lancelot
this
filthy
open
drain
running
right
before
the
door
why
ca
you
clean
it
out
what
harm
does
that
do
answered
the
woman
peevishly
here
my
master
gets
up
to
his
work
by
five
in
the
morning
and
not
back
till
seven
at
night
and
by
then
he
ai
in
no
humour
to
clean
out
gutters
and
where
the
water
to
come
from
to
keep
a
place
clean
it
costs
many
a
one
of
us
here
a
shilling
a
week
the
summer
through
to
pay
fetching
water
up
the
hill
we
work
enough
to
fill
our
kettles
the
muck
must
just
lie
in
the
road
smell
or
none
till
the
rain
carries
it
away
lancelot
sighed
again
would
be
a
good
thing
for
ashy
tregarva
if
the
did
some
fine
morning
run
up
to
ashy
down
as
poor
harry
verney
said
on
his
deathbed
wo
be
much
of
ashy
left
by
that
time
sir
if
the
landlords
go
on
pulling
down
cottages
at
their
present
rate
driving
the
people
into
the
towns
to
herd
together
there
like
hogs
and
walk
out
to
their
work
four
or
five
miles
every
morning
said
lancelot
one
goes
one
sees
commodious
new
cottages
springing
up
you
go
sir
but
what
of
wherever
you
do
go
along
the
roadsides
and
round
the
gentlemen
parks
where
the
cottages
are
in
sight
it
all
very
smart
but
just
go
into
the
outlying
hamlets
a
whited
sepulchre
sir
is
many
a
great
estate
outwardly
swept
and
garnished
and
inwardly
full
of
all
uncleanliness
and
dead
men
bones
at
this
moment
two
cloaked
and
veiled
figures
came
up
to
the
door
followed
by
a
servant
there
was
no
mistaking
those
delicate
footsteps
and
the
two
young
men
drew
back
with
fluttering
hearts
and
breathed
out
silent
blessings
on
the
ministering
angels
as
they
entered
the
crazy
and
reeking
house
thinking
sir
said
tregarva
as
they
walked
slowly
and
reluctantly
away
it
is
hard
of
the
gentlemen
to
leave
all
god
work
to
the
ladies
as
of
them
do
i
am
thinking
tregarva
that
both
for
ladies
and
gentlemen
prevention
is
better
than
cure
a
great
change
come
over
miss
argemone
sir
she
used
not
to
be
so
ready
to
start
out
at
midnight
to
visit
dying
folk
a
blessed
change
lancelot
thought
so
too
and
he
thought
that
he
knew
the
cause
of
it
argemone
appearance
and
their
late
conversation
had
started
a
new
covey
of
strange
fancies
lancelot
followed
them
over
hill
and
dale
glad
to
escape
a
moment
from
the
mournful
lessons
of
that
evening
but
even
over
them
there
was
a
cloud
of
sadness
harry
verney
last
words
and
argemone
accidental
whisper
about
curse
upon
the
lavingtons
rose
to
his
mind
he
longed
to
ask
tregarva
but
he
was
afraid
not
of
the
man
for
there
was
a
delicacy
in
his
truthfulness
which
encouraged
the
most
utter
confidence
but
of
the
subject
itself
but
curiosity
conquered
did
old
harry
mean
about
the
he
said
at
last
one
seemed
to
understand
him
sir
he
ought
to
have
talked
of
it
but
dying
men
at
times
see
over
the
dark
water
into
deep
things
deeper
than
they
think
themselves
perhaps
there
one
speaks
through
them
but
i
thought
every
one
knew
the
story
do
not
at
least
it
so
much
the
better
sir
i
must
insist
on
knowing
it
is
necessary
proper
that
is
that
i
should
hear
everything
that
concerns
understand
sir
so
it
is
and
i
tell
you
the
story
goes
that
in
the
old
popish
times
when
the
nuns
held
whitford
priors
the
first
lavington
that
ever
was
came
from
the
king
with
a
warrant
to
turn
them
all
out
poor
souls
and
take
the
lands
for
his
own
and
they
say
the
head
lady
of
them
prioress
or
abbess
as
they
called
her
withstood
him
and
cursed
him
in
the
name
of
the
lord
for
a
hypocrite
who
robbed
harmless
women
under
the
cloak
of
punishing
them
for
sins
they
never
committed
for
they
say
sir
he
went
up
to
court
and
slandered
the
nuns
there
for
drunkards
and
worse
and
she
told
him
that
the
curse
of
the
nuns
of
whitford
should
be
on
him
and
his
till
they
helped
the
poor
in
the
spirit
of
the
nuns
of
whitford
and
the
ran
up
to
ashy
down
time
is
not
come
yet
said
lancelot
the
worst
is
to
come
sir
for
he
or
his
sir
that
night
said
or
did
something
to
the
lady
that
was
more
than
woman
heart
could
bear
and
the
next
morning
she
was
found
dead
and
cold
drowned
in
that
and
there
the
gentleman
eldest
son
was
drowned
and
more
than
one
lavington
beside
miss
argemone
only
brother
that
was
the
heir
was
drowned
there
too
when
he
was
a
little
one
never
heard
that
she
had
a
brother
sir
no
one
talks
of
it
there
are
many
things
happen
in
the
great
house
that
you
must
go
to
the
little
house
to
hear
of
but
the
believe
sir
that
the
nun
curse
holds
true
and
they
say
that
whitford
folks
have
been
getting
poorer
and
wickeder
ever
since
that
time
and
will
till
the
runs
up
to
ashy
and
the
lavingtons
name
goes
out
of
whitford
priors
lancelot
said
nothing
a
presentiment
of
evil
hung
over
him
he
was
utterly
about
tregarva
about
argemone
about
the
poor
the
truth
was
he
could
not
shake
off
the
impression
of
the
scene
he
had
left
utterly
disappointed
and
disgusted
with
the
he
had
expected
as
i
said
before
at
least
to
hear
something
of
pastoral
sentiment
and
of
genial
frolicsome
humour
to
see
some
innocent
simple
enjoyment
but
instead
what
had
he
seen
but
vanity
jealousy
hoggish
sensuality
dull
vacuity
drudges
struggling
for
one
night
to
forget
their
drudgery
and
yet
withal
those
songs
and
the
effect
which
they
produced
showed
that
in
these
poor
creatures
too
lay
the
germs
of
pathos
taste
melody
soft
and
noble
affections
right
have
we
thought
he
hinder
their
development
art
poetry
music
science
ay
even
those
athletic
and
graceful
exercises
on
which
we
all
pride
ourselves
which
we
consider
necessary
to
soften
and
refine
ourselves
what
god
has
given
us
a
monopoly
of
them
what
is
good
for
the
rich
man
is
good
for
the
poor
and
what
of
that
what
if
the
poor
be
raised
above
their
station
what
right
have
we
to
keep
them
down
how
long
have
they
been
our
born
thralls
in
soul
as
well
as
in
body
what
right
have
we
to
say
that
they
shall
know
no
higher
recreation
than
the
hogs
because
forsooth
if
we
raised
them
they
might
refuse
to
work
for
us
are
we
to
fix
how
far
their
minds
may
be
developed
has
not
god
fixed
it
for
us
when
he
gave
them
the
same
passions
talents
tastes
as
our
own
tregarva
meditations
must
have
been
running
in
a
very
different
channel
for
he
suddenly
burst
out
after
a
long
silence
a
pity
these
fairs
ca
be
put
down
they
do
a
lot
of
harm
ruin
all
the
young
girls
round
the
dissenters
children
especially
for
they
run
utterly
wild
their
parents
have
no
hold
on
them
at
all
tell
them
that
they
are
children
of
the
devil
said
lancelot
wonder
if
the
children
take
them
at
their
word
and
act
accordingly
parson
here
sir
who
is
a
man
enough
tried
hard
to
put
down
this
one
but
the
innkeepers
were
too
strong
for
him
take
away
their
only
amusement
in
short
he
had
much
better
have
set
to
work
to
amuse
them
himself
business
is
to
save
souls
sir
and
not
to
amuse
them
i
do
see
sir
what
christian
people
want
with
such
vanities
lancelot
did
not
argue
the
point
for
he
knew
the
prejudices
of
dissenters
on
the
subject
but
it
did
strike
him
that
if
tregarva
brain
had
been
a
little
less
preponderant
he
too
might
have
found
the
need
of
some
recreation
besides
books
and
thought
by
this
time
they
were
at
lancelot
door
he
bid
the
keeper
a
hearty
made
him
promise
to
see
him
next
day
and
went
to
bed
and
slept
till
nearly
noon
when
he
walked
into
his
he
found
a
note
on
the
table
in
his
uncle
handwriting
the
vicar
servant
had
left
it
an
hour
before
he
opened
it
listlessly
rang
the
bell
furiously
ordered
out
his
best
horse
and
huddling
on
his
clothes
galloped
to
the
nearest
station
caught
the
train
and
arrived
at
his
uncle
bank
it
had
stopped
payment
two
hours
before
chapter
xiv
what
to
be
done
yes
the
bank
had
stopped
the
ancient
firm
of
smith
brown
jones
robinson
and
which
had
been
for
some
years
past
expanding
from
a
solid
golden
organism
into
a
and
huge
balloon
of
threadbare
paper
had
at
last
worn
through
and
collapsed
dropping
its
car
and
human
contents
miserably
into
the
thames
mud
why
detail
the
pitiable
examination
resulting
lancelot
sickened
over
it
for
many
a
long
day
not
indeed
mourning
at
his
private
losses
but
at
the
thorough
hollowness
of
the
system
which
it
exposed
about
which
he
spoke
his
mind
pretty
freely
to
his
uncle
who
bore
it
enough
indeed
the
discussions
to
which
it
gave
rise
rather
comforted
the
good
man
by
turning
his
thought
from
his
own
losses
to
general
principles
have
ruined
you
my
poor
boy
he
used
to
say
you
may
as
well
take
your
money
worth
out
of
me
in
bullying
nothing
indeed
could
surpass
his
honest
and
manly
sorrow
for
having
been
the
cause
of
lancelot
beggary
but
as
for
persuading
him
that
his
system
was
wrong
it
was
quite
impossible
not
that
lancelot
was
hard
upon
him
on
the
contrary
he
assured
him
repeatedly
of
his
conviction
that
the
precepts
of
the
bible
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
laws
of
commerce
that
though
the
jews
were
forbidden
to
take
interest
of
jews
christians
had
a
perfect
right
to
be
as
hard
as
they
liked
on
christians
that
there
could
not
be
the
least
harm
in
for
though
it
did
to
be
sure
add
nothing
to
the
wealth
of
the
community
only
conjure
money
out
of
your
neighbour
pocket
into
your
own
yet
was
not
that
all
fair
in
trade
if
a
man
did
not
know
the
real
value
of
the
shares
he
sold
you
you
were
not
bound
to
tell
him
again
lancelot
quite
agreed
with
his
uncle
that
though
covetousness
might
be
idolatry
yet
could
not
be
called
covetousness
and
that
on
the
whole
though
making
haste
to
be
rich
was
denounced
as
a
dangerous
and
ruinous
temptation
in
paul
times
that
was
not
the
slightest
reason
why
it
should
be
so
now
all
these
concessions
were
made
with
a
freedom
which
caused
the
good
banker
to
suspect
at
times
that
his
shrewd
nephew
was
laughing
at
him
in
his
sleeve
but
he
could
not
but
subscribe
to
them
for
the
sake
of
consistency
though
as
a
staunch
protestant
it
puzzled
him
a
little
at
times
to
find
it
necessary
to
justify
himself
by
getting
his
nephew
to
explain
away
so
much
of
the
bible
for
him
but
men
are
accustomed
to
do
that
and
so
was
he
once
only
did
lancelot
break
out
with
his
real
sentiments
when
the
banker
was
planning
how
to
his
credit
to
set
to
work
in
fact
to
blow
over
again
the
same
bubble
which
had
already
burst
under
him
i
were
a
christian
said
lancelot
you
i
would
call
this
credit
system
of
yours
the
devil
selfish
counterfeit
of
god
order
of
mutual
love
and
trust
the
child
of
that
miserable
dream
which
as
chalmers
well
said
expects
universal
selfishness
to
do
the
work
of
universal
love
look
at
your
credit
system
how
not
in
its
abuse
but
in
its
very
essence
it
carries
the
seeds
of
destruction
in
the
first
place
a
man
credit
depends
not
upon
his
real
worth
and
property
but
upon
his
reputation
for
property
daily
and
hourly
he
is
tempted
he
is
forced
to
puff
himself
to
pretend
to
be
richer
than
he
is
the
banker
sighed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
all
do
it
my
dear
boy
know
it
you
must
do
it
or
be
more
than
human
there
is
lie
the
first
and
look
at
lie
the
second
this
credit
system
is
founded
on
the
universal
faith
and
honour
of
men
towards
men
but
do
you
think
faith
and
honour
can
be
the
children
of
selfishness
men
must
be
chivalrous
and
disinterested
to
be
honourable
and
you
expect
them
all
to
join
in
universal
faith
each
for
his
own
selfish
interest
you
forget
that
if
that
is
the
prime
motive
men
will
be
honourable
only
as
long
as
it
suits
that
same
the
banker
shrugged
his
shoulders
again
my
dear
uncle
said
lancelot
all
forget
it
though
you
suffer
for
it
daily
and
hourly
though
the
honourable
men
among
you
complain
of
the
stain
which
has
fallen
on
the
old
chivalrous
good
faith
of
english
commerce
and
say
that
now
abroad
as
well
as
at
home
an
englishman
word
is
no
longer
worth
other
men
bonds
you
see
the
evil
and
you
deplore
it
in
disgust
ask
yourself
honestly
how
can
you
battle
against
it
while
you
allow
in
practice
and
in
theory
too
except
in
church
on
sundays
the
very
falsehood
from
which
it
all
springs
that
a
man
is
bound
to
get
wealth
not
for
his
country
but
for
himself
that
in
short
not
patriotism
but
selfishness
is
the
bond
of
all
society
selfishness
can
collect
not
unite
a
herd
of
cowardly
wild
cattle
that
they
may
feed
together
breed
together
keep
off
the
wolf
and
bear
together
but
when
one
of
your
wild
cattle
falls
sick
what
becomes
of
the
corporate
feelings
of
the
herd
then
for
one
man
of
your
class
who
is
nobly
helped
by
his
fellows
are
not
the
thousand
left
behind
to
perish
your
bible
talks
of
society
not
as
a
herd
but
as
a
living
tree
an
organic
individual
body
a
holy
brotherhood
and
kingdom
of
god
and
here
is
an
idol
which
you
have
set
up
instead
of
it
but
the
banker
was
deaf
to
all
arguments
no
doubt
he
had
plenty
for
he
was
himself
a
just
and
generous
ay
and
a
man
in
his
way
only
he
regarded
lancelot
young
fancies
as
too
visionary
to
deserve
an
answer
which
they
most
probably
are
else
having
been
broached
as
often
as
they
have
been
they
would
surely
ere
now
have
provoked
the
complete
refutation
which
can
no
doubt
be
given
to
them
by
hundreds
of
learned
votaries
of
commerce
and
here
i
beg
my
readers
to
recollect
that
i
am
in
no
way
answerable
for
the
speculations
either
of
lancelot
or
any
of
his
acquaintances
and
that
these
papers
have
been
from
beginning
to
end
as
in
name
so
in
nature
yeast
an
honest
sample
of
the
questions
which
good
or
bad
are
fermenting
in
the
minds
of
the
young
of
this
day
and
are
rapidly
leavening
the
minds
of
the
rising
generation
no
doubt
they
are
all
as
full
of
fallacies
as
possible
but
as
long
as
the
saying
of
the
german
sage
stands
true
that
destiny
of
any
nation
at
any
given
moment
depends
on
the
opinions
of
its
young
men
under
so
long
it
must
be
worth
while
for
those
who
wish
to
preserve
the
present
order
of
society
to
justify
its
acknowledged
evils
somewhat
not
only
to
the
few
young
men
who
are
interested
in
preserving
them
but
also
to
the
many
who
are
not
though
therefore
i
am
neither
plymouth
brother
nor
communist
and
as
thoroughly
convinced
as
the
newspapers
can
make
me
that
to
assert
the
duties
of
property
is
only
to
plot
its
destruction
and
that
a
community
of
goods
must
needs
imply
a
community
of
wives
as
every
one
knows
was
the
case
with
the
apostolic
christians
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
narrating
lancelot
fanatical
conduct
without
execratory
comment
certain
that
he
will
still
receive
his
just
reward
of
condemnation
and
that
if
i
find
facts
a
sensible
public
will
find
abhorrence
for
them
his
behaviour
was
indeed
most
singular
he
absolutely
refused
a
good
commercial
situation
which
his
uncle
procured
him
he
did
not
believe
in
being
by
a
hair
of
the
dog
that
bit
him
and
he
refused
also
the
really
generous
offers
of
the
creditors
to
allow
him
a
sufficient
maintenance
he
said
more
pay
without
work
for
me
i
will
earn
my
bread
or
starve
it
seems
god
will
to
teach
me
what
poverty
is
i
will
see
that
his
intention
is
not
left
half
fulfilled
i
have
sinned
and
only
in
the
stern
delight
of
a
just
penance
can
i
gain
my
dear
madman
said
his
uncle
are
just
the
innocent
one
among
us
all
you
at
least
were
only
a
sleeping
partner
therein
lies
my
sin
i
took
money
which
i
never
earned
and
cared
as
little
how
it
was
gained
as
how
i
spent
it
henceforth
i
shall
touch
no
farthing
which
is
the
fruit
of
a
system
which
i
can
not
approve
i
accuse
no
one
actions
may
vary
in
rightfulness
according
to
the
age
and
the
person
but
what
may
be
right
for
you
because
you
think
it
right
is
surely
wrong
for
me
because
i
think
it
wrong
so
with
grim
determination
he
sent
to
the
hammer
every
article
he
possessed
till
he
had
literally
nothing
left
but
the
clothes
in
which
he
stood
could
not
rest
he
said
he
had
pulled
out
all
his
borrowed
peacock
feathers
when
they
were
gone
he
should
be
able
to
see
at
last
whether
he
was
jackdaw
or
eagle
and
wonder
not
reader
at
this
same
strength
of
will
the
very
genius
which
too
often
makes
its
possessor
in
common
matters
from
the
intense
capability
of
enjoyment
which
it
brings
may
also
when
once
his
whole
being
is
stirred
into
motion
by
some
great
object
transform
him
into
a
hero
and
he
carried
a
letter
too
in
his
bosom
night
and
day
which
routed
all
coward
fears
and
sad
forebodings
as
soon
as
they
arose
and
converted
the
lonely
and
squalid
lodging
to
which
he
had
retired
into
a
fairy
palace
peopled
with
bright
phantoms
of
future
bliss
i
need
not
say
from
whom
it
came
it
ran
you
need
not
pain
yourself
to
tell
me
anything
i
know
all
and
i
know
too
do
not
ask
me
how
your
noble
determination
to
drink
the
wholesome
cup
of
poverty
to
the
very
dregs
that
i
were
with
you
oh
that
i
could
give
you
my
fortune
but
that
is
not
yet
alas
in
my
own
power
no
rather
would
i
share
that
poverty
with
you
and
strengthen
you
in
your
purpose
and
yet
i
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
you
lonely
perhaps
miserable
but
courage
though
you
have
lost
all
you
have
found
me
and
now
you
are
knitting
me
to
you
for
ever
justifying
my
own
love
to
me
by
your
nobleness
and
am
i
not
worth
all
the
world
to
you
i
dare
say
this
to
you
you
will
not
think
me
conceited
can
we
misunderstand
each
other
hearts
and
all
this
while
you
are
alone
oh
i
have
mourned
for
you
since
i
heard
of
your
misfortune
i
have
not
tasted
pleasure
the
light
of
heaven
has
been
black
to
me
and
i
have
lived
only
upon
love
i
will
not
taste
comfort
while
you
are
wretched
would
that
i
could
be
poor
like
you
every
night
upon
the
bare
floor
i
lie
down
to
sleep
and
fancy
you
in
your
little
chamber
and
nestle
to
you
and
cover
that
dear
face
with
kisses
strange
that
i
should
dare
to
speak
thus
to
you
whom
a
few
months
ago
i
had
never
heard
of
wonderful
simplicity
of
love
how
all
that
is
prudish
and
artificial
flees
before
it
i
seem
to
have
begun
a
new
life
if
i
could
play
now
it
would
be
only
with
little
children
farewell
be
great
a
glorious
future
is
before
you
and
me
in
you
lancelot
answer
must
remain
untold
perhaps
the
veil
has
been
already
too
far
lifted
which
hides
the
sanctuary
of
such
love
but
alas
to
his
letter
no
second
had
been
returned
and
he
felt
though
he
dared
not
confess
it
to
himself
a
gloomy
presentiment
of
evil
flit
across
him
as
he
thought
of
his
fallen
fortunes
and
the
altered
light
in
which
his
suit
would
be
regarded
by
argemone
parents
once
he
blamed
himself
bitterly
for
not
having
gone
to
lavington
the
moment
he
discovered
argemone
affection
and
insuring
as
he
then
might
have
done
his
consent
but
again
he
felt
that
no
sloth
had
kept
him
back
but
adoring
reverence
for
his
treasure
and
humble
astonishment
at
his
own
happiness
and
he
fled
from
the
thought
into
renewed
examination
into
the
state
of
the
masses
the
effect
of
which
was
only
to
deepen
his
own
determination
to
share
their
lot
but
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
to
him
but
fair
to
live
as
long
as
it
would
last
on
that
part
of
his
capital
which
his
creditors
would
have
given
nothing
for
namely
his
information
and
he
set
to
work
to
write
but
alas
he
had
but
a
literary
connection
and
the
entree
of
the
initiated
ring
is
not
obtained
in
a
besides
he
would
not
write
he
was
in
far
too
grim
a
humour
for
that
and
if
he
wrote
on
important
subjects
able
editors
always
were
in
the
habit
of
entrusting
them
to
old
contributors
men
in
short
in
whose
judgment
they
had
confidence
not
to
say
anything
which
would
commit
the
magazine
to
anything
but
its
own
little
and
behold
poor
lancelot
found
himself
of
no
party
whatsoever
he
was
in
a
minority
of
one
against
the
whole
world
on
all
points
right
or
wrong
he
had
the
unhappiest
knack
as
all
geniuses
have
of
seeing
connections
humorous
or
awful
between
the
most
seemingly
antipodal
things
of
illustrating
every
subject
from
three
or
four
different
spheres
which
it
is
anathema
to
mention
in
the
same
page
if
he
wrote
a
article
able
editors
asked
him
what
the
deuce
a
scrap
of
did
in
the
middle
of
it
if
he
took
the
same
article
to
a
magazine
the
editor
could
not
commit
himself
to
any
theory
which
made
the
earth
more
than
six
thousand
years
old
and
was
afraid
that
the
public
taste
would
not
approve
of
the
allusions
to
and
soyer
and
worse
than
that
one
and
all
jew
turk
infidel
and
heretic
as
well
as
the
orthodox
joined
in
pious
horror
at
his
irreverence
the
shocking
way
he
had
of
jumbling
religion
and
politics
the
human
and
the
divine
the
theories
of
the
pulpit
with
the
facts
of
the
the
very
atheists
who
laughed
at
him
for
believing
in
a
god
agreed
that
that
at
least
was
inconsistent
with
the
dignity
of
the
god
who
did
not
it
was
syncretism
well
friends
quoth
lancelot
to
himself
in
bitter
rage
one
day
you
choose
to
be
without
god
in
the
world
and
to
honour
him
by
denying
him
do
so
you
shall
have
your
way
and
go
to
the
place
whither
it
seems
leading
you
just
now
at
railroad
pace
but
i
must
well
at
least
there
is
some
old
college
nonsense
of
mine
written
three
years
ago
when
i
believed
like
you
that
all
heaven
and
earth
was
put
together
out
of
separate
bits
like
a
child
puzzle
and
that
each
topic
ought
to
have
its
private
little
all
to
itself
in
a
man
brain
like
drugs
in
a
chemist
shop
perhaps
it
will
suit
you
friends
perhaps
it
will
be
and
narrow
and
dogmatic
and
cowardly
and
godless
enough
for
so
he
went
forth
with
them
to
market
and
behold
they
were
bought
forthwith
there
was
verily
a
demand
for
such
and
in
spite
of
the
ten
thousand
which
were
daily
pouring
out
similar
stygian
liquors
the
public
thirst
remained
unslaked
thought
lancelot
negro
race
is
not
the
only
one
which
is
afflicted
with
manias
for
eating
by
the
bye
where
is
poor
luke
ah
where
was
poor
luke
lancelot
had
received
from
him
one
short
and
hurried
note
blotted
with
tears
which
told
how
he
had
informed
his
father
and
how
his
father
had
refused
to
see
him
and
had
forbid
him
the
house
and
how
he
had
offered
him
an
allowance
of
fifty
pounds
a
year
it
should
have
been
five
hundred
he
said
if
he
had
possessed
it
which
luke
director
sensibly
enough
had
compelled
him
to
and
there
the
letter
ended
abruptly
leaving
the
writer
evidently
in
lower
depths
than
he
had
either
experienced
already
or
expected
at
all
lancelot
had
often
pleaded
for
him
with
his
father
but
in
vain
not
that
the
good
man
was
he
would
cry
like
a
child
about
it
all
to
lancelot
when
they
sat
together
after
dinner
but
he
was
utterly
beside
himself
what
with
grief
shame
terror
and
astonishment
on
the
whole
the
sorrow
was
a
real
comfort
to
him
it
gave
him
something
beside
his
bankruptcy
to
think
of
and
distracted
between
the
two
different
griefs
he
could
brood
over
neither
but
of
the
two
certainly
his
son
conversion
was
the
worst
in
his
eyes
the
bankruptcy
was
intelligible
measurable
it
was
something
known
and
classified
part
of
the
ills
which
flesh
or
at
least
commercial
flesh
is
heir
to
but
going
to
rome
ca
understand
it
i
wo
believe
it
it
so
foolish
you
see
lancelot
so
foolish
like
an
ass
that
eats
thistles
there
must
be
some
reason
there
must
be
something
we
do
know
sir
do
you
think
they
could
have
promised
to
make
him
a
cardinal
lancelot
quite
agreed
that
there
were
reasons
for
it
that
they
or
at
least
the
banker
did
not
upon
it
they
promised
him
something
some
perhaps
else
why
on
earth
could
a
man
go
over
it
out
of
the
course
of
nature
lancelot
tried
in
vain
to
make
him
understand
that
a
man
might
sacrifice
everything
to
conscience
and
actually
give
up
all
worldly
weal
for
what
he
thought
right
the
banker
turned
on
him
with
angry
resignation
well
i
suppose
he
done
right
then
i
suppose
you
go
next
take
up
a
false
religion
and
give
up
everything
for
it
why
then
he
must
be
honest
and
if
he
honest
he
in
the
right
and
i
suppose
i
better
go
too
lancelot
argued
but
in
vain
the
idea
of
disinterested
sacrifice
was
so
utterly
foreign
to
the
good
man
own
creed
and
practice
that
he
could
but
see
one
pair
of
alternatives
he
is
a
good
man
or
he
a
hypocrite
either
he
right
or
he
gone
over
for
some
vile
selfish
end
and
what
can
that
be
but
money
lancelot
gently
hinted
that
there
might
be
other
selfish
ends
besides
pecuniary
ones
saving
one
soul
for
instance
if
he
wants
to
save
his
soul
he
right
what
ought
we
all
to
do
but
try
to
save
our
souls
i
tell
you
there
some
sinister
reason
they
told
him
that
they
expect
to
convert
england
i
should
like
to
see
them
do
it
and
that
he
be
made
a
bishop
do
argue
with
me
or
you
drive
me
mad
i
know
those
jesuits
and
as
soon
as
he
began
upon
the
jesuits
lancelot
prudently
held
his
tongue
the
good
man
had
worked
himself
up
into
a
perfect
frenzy
of
terror
and
suspicion
about
them
he
suspected
concealed
jesuits
among
his
footmen
and
his
housemaids
jesuits
in
his
jesuits
in
his
it
sir
how
do
i
know
that
there
ai
a
jesuit
listening
to
us
now
behind
the
curtain
go
and
look
quoth
lancelot
and
suited
the
action
to
the
word
if
there
ai
there
might
be
they
everywhere
i
tell
you
that
vicar
of
whitford
was
a
jesuit
i
was
sure
of
it
all
along
but
the
man
seemed
so
pious
and
certainly
he
did
my
poor
dear
boy
a
deal
of
good
but
he
ruined
you
you
know
and
i
convinced
no
do
contradict
me
i
tell
you
i
wo
stand
it
i
convinced
that
this
whole
mess
of
mine
is
a
plot
of
those
rascals
i
as
certain
of
it
as
if
they
told
me
what
end
the
deuce
can
i
tell
am
i
a
jesuit
to
understand
their
sneaking
underhand
pah
i
sick
of
life
nothing
but
rogues
wherever
one
turns
and
then
lancelot
used
to
try
to
persuade
him
to
take
poor
luke
back
again
but
vague
terror
had
steeled
his
heart
why
he
convert
us
all
he
convert
his
sisters
he
bring
his
priests
in
here
or
his
nuns
disguised
as
ladies
maids
and
we
should
all
go
over
every
one
of
us
like
a
set
of
pins
seem
to
think
protestantism
a
rather
shaky
cause
if
it
is
so
easy
to
be
upset
protestantism
is
the
cause
of
england
and
christianity
and
civilisation
and
freedom
and
common
sense
sir
and
that
the
very
reason
why
it
so
easy
to
pervert
men
from
it
and
the
very
reason
why
it
a
lost
cause
and
popery
and
antichrist
and
the
gates
of
hell
are
coming
in
like
a
flood
to
prevail
against
it
thought
lancelot
is
the
very
strangest
reason
for
it
being
a
lost
cause
perhaps
if
my
poor
uncle
believed
it
really
to
be
the
cause
of
god
himself
he
would
not
be
in
such
extreme
fear
for
it
or
fancy
it
required
such
a
hotbed
and
greenhouse
really
if
his
sisters
were
little
girls
of
ten
years
old
who
looked
up
to
him
as
an
oracle
there
would
be
some
reason
in
but
those
tall
flirting
cousins
of
mine
who
would
have
been
glad
enough
either
of
them
two
months
ago
to
snap
up
me
infidelity
bad
character
and
all
as
a
charming
rich
young
roue
if
they
have
not
learnt
enough
protestantism
in
the
last
years
to
take
care
of
themselves
protestantism
must
have
very
few
allurements
or
else
be
very
badly
carried
out
in
practice
by
those
who
talk
loudest
in
favour
of
i
heard
them
praising
ministry
by
the
bye
the
other
day
so
he
is
up
in
town
at
last
at
the
summit
of
his
ambition
well
he
may
suit
them
i
wonder
how
many
young
creatures
like
argemone
and
luke
he
would
keep
from
popery
but
there
was
no
use
arguing
with
a
man
in
such
a
state
of
mind
and
gradually
lancelot
gave
it
up
in
hopes
that
time
would
bring
the
good
man
to
his
sane
wits
again
and
that
a
father
feelings
would
prove
themselves
stronger
because
more
divine
than
a
protestant
fears
though
that
would
have
been
in
the
banker
eyes
and
in
the
jesuit
also
so
do
extremes
meet
the
very
reason
for
expecting
them
to
be
the
weaker
for
it
is
the
rule
with
all
bigots
that
the
right
cause
is
always
a
lost
cause
and
therefore
requires
god
weapons
of
love
truth
and
reason
being
well
known
to
be
too
weak
to
be
defended
if
it
is
to
be
saved
with
the
devil
weapons
of
bad
logic
spite
and
calumny
at
last
in
despair
of
obtaining
tidings
of
his
cousin
by
any
other
method
lancelot
made
up
his
mind
to
apply
to
a
certain
remarkable
man
whose
had
preceded
luke
about
a
year
and
had
indeed
mainly
caused
it
he
went
and
was
not
disappointed
with
the
most
winning
courtesy
and
sweetness
his
story
and
his
request
were
patiently
listened
to
outcome
of
your
speech
then
my
dear
sir
as
i
apprehend
it
is
a
request
to
me
to
send
back
the
fugitive
lamb
into
the
jaws
of
the
but
still
lupine
wolf
this
was
spoken
with
so
sweet
and
arch
a
smile
that
it
was
impossible
to
be
angry
my
honour
i
have
no
wish
to
convert
him
all
i
want
is
to
have
human
speech
of
him
to
hear
from
his
own
lips
that
he
is
content
whither
should
i
convert
him
not
to
my
own
platform
for
i
am
nowhere
not
to
that
which
he
has
left
for
if
he
could
have
found
standing
ground
there
he
would
not
have
gone
elsewhere
for
rest
they
went
out
from
you
because
they
were
not
of
you
said
the
half
aside
true
sir
i
have
felt
long
that
argument
was
bootless
with
those
whose
of
deity
man
earth
and
heaven
were
as
utterly
different
from
my
own
as
if
we
had
been
created
by
two
different
beings
you
include
in
that
catalogue
those
ideas
of
truth
love
and
justice
which
are
deity
itself
have
you
no
common
ground
in
them
are
an
elder
and
a
better
man
than
it
would
be
insolent
in
me
to
answer
that
question
except
in
one
way
and
that
you
can
not
answer
it
be
it
you
shall
see
your
cousin
you
may
make
what
efforts
you
will
for
his
the
catholic
church
continued
he
with
one
of
his
arch
meaning
smiles
not
like
popular
protestantism
driven
into
shrieking
terror
at
the
approach
of
a
foe
she
has
too
much
faith
in
herself
and
in
him
who
gives
to
her
the
power
of
truth
to
expect
every
gay
meadow
to
allure
away
her
lambs
from
the
fold
assure
you
that
your
gallant
permission
is
unnecessary
i
am
beginning
at
least
to
believe
that
there
is
a
father
in
heaven
who
educates
his
children
and
i
have
no
wish
to
interfere
with
his
methods
let
my
cousin
go
his
way
he
will
learn
something
which
he
wanted
i
doubt
not
on
his
present
path
even
as
i
shall
on

too
wherever
the

may
guide
him
if
it

a

and

to

to

maris

it
is
the

of
bethlehem
which
he
follows

and
he
bowed
his
head
reverently
that
you
too
would
submit
yourself
to
that
guidance
you
too
would
seem
to
want
some
loving
heart
whereon
to
lancelot
sighed

not
a

a
man
i
want
not

to

but
a
man
to
rule

slowly
his
companion
raised
his
thin
hand
and
pointed
to
the
crucifix
which
stood
at
the
other
end
of
the
apartment
him
and
he
bowed
his
head
once
more
and
lancelot
he
knew
not
why
did
the
same
and
yet
in
an
instant
he
threw
his
head
up
proudly
and
answered
with
george
fox
old
reply
to
the
puritans
want
a
live
christ
not
a
dead
that
is
noble
beautiful
it
may
be
but
it
has
no
message
for
me
died
for
you
care
for
the
world
and
not
myself
died
for
the
world
has
deserted
it
as
folks
say
now
and
become
an
absentee
performing
his
work
by
do
not
start
the
blasphemy
is
not
mine
but
those
who
preach
it
no
wonder
that
the
owners
of
the
soil
think
it
no
shame
to
desert
their
estates
when
preachers
tell
them
that
he
to
whom
they
say
all
power
is
given
in
heaven
and
earth
has
deserted
his
would
you
have
my
dear
sir
asked
the
father
the
jews
had
a
king
of
my
nation
and
of
the
hearts
of
my
nation
who
would
teach
soldiers
artists
craftsmen
statesmen
poets
priests
if
priests
there
must
be
i
want
a
human
lord
who
understands
me
and
the
millions
round
me
pities
us
teaches
us
orders
our
history
civilisation
development
for
us
i
come
to
you
full
of
manhood
and
you
send
me
to
a
woman
i
go
to
the
protestants
full
of
desires
to
right
the
world
and
they
begin
to
talk
of
the
next
life
and
give
up
this
as
lost
a
quiet
smile
lighted
up
the
thin
wan
face
full
of
unfathomable
thoughts
and
he
replied
again
half
to
himself
i
god
to
kill
or
to
make
alive
that
thou
sendest
to
me
to
recover
a
man
of
his
leprosy
farewell
you
shall
see
your
cousin
here
at
noon
you
will
not
refuse
my
blessing
or
my
prayers
even
though
they
be
offered
to
a
mother
will
refuse
nothing
in
the
form
of
human
love
and
the
father
blessed
him
fervently
and
he
went
a
man
said
he
to
himself
rather
the
wreck
of
what
a
man
oh
for
such
a
heart
with
the
thews
and
sinews
of
a
truly
english
brain
next
day
he
met
luke
in
that
room
their
talk
was
short
and
sad
luke
was
on
the
point
of
entering
an
order
devoted
especially
to
the
worship
of
the
blessed
virgin
father
has
cast
me
out
i
must
go
to
her
feet
she
will
have
mercy
though
man
has
none
why
enter
the
order
why
take
an
irrevocable
step
it
is
irrevocable
because
i
shall
enter
an
utterly
new
life
in
which
old
things
shall
pass
away
and
all
things
become
new
and
i
shall
forget
the
very
names
of
parent
englishman
citizen
the
very
existence
of
that
strange
babel
of
man
building
whose
roar
and
moan
oppress
me
every
time
i
walk
the
street
oh
for
solitude
meditation
penance
oh
to
make
up
by
bitter
my
ingratitude
to
her
who
has
been
leading
me
unseen
for
years
home
to
her
bosom
the
mother
daughter
of
gabriel
spouse
of
deity
flower
of
the
earth
whom
i
have
so
long
despised
oh
to
follow
the
example
of
the
blessed
mary
of
oignies
who
every
day
inflicted
on
her
most
holy
person
eleven
hundred
stripes
in
honour
of
that
maiden
an
honour
i
could
have
thought
would
have
pleased
better
kali
the
of
the
thugs
thought
lancelot
to
himself
but
he
had
not
the
heart
to
say
it
and
he
only
replied
torture
propitiates
the
virgin
that
explains
the
strange
story
i
read
lately
of
her
having
appeared
in
the
cevennes
and
informed
the
peasantry
that
she
had
sent
the
potato
disease
on
account
of
their
neglecting
her
shrines
that
unless
they
repented
she
would
next
year
destroy
their
cattle
and
the
third
year
themselves
not
asked
poor
luke
not
indeed
if
god
is
to
be
capricious
proud
revengeful
why
not
the
son
of
god
and
if
the
son
of
god
why
not
his
mother
judge
spiritual
feelings
by
the
carnal
test
of
the
understanding
your
protestant
horror
of
asceticism
lies
at
the
root
of
all
you
say
how
can
you
comprehend
the
the
absolute
delight
of
far
from
it
i
have
always
had
an
infinite
respect
for
asceticism
as
a
noble
and
manful
thing
the
only
manful
thing
to
my
eyes
left
in
popery
and
fast
dying
out
of
that
under
jesuit
influence
you
recollect
the
quarrel
between
the
tablet
and
the
jesuits
over
faber
unlucky
honesty
about
rose
of
lima
but
really
as
long
as
you
honour
asceticism
as
a
means
of
appeasing
the
angry
deities
i
shall
prefer
to
dominic
cuirass
or
hedwiga
chilblains
john
mytton
two
hours
crawl
on
the
ice
in
his
shirt
after
a
flock
of
wild
ducks
they
both
endured
like
heroes
but
the
former
for
a
selfish
if
not
a
blasphemous
end
the
latter
as
a
man
should
to
test
and
strengthen
his
own
powers
of
there
i
will
say
no
more
go
your
way
in
god
name
there
must
be
lessons
to
be
learnt
in
all
strong
and
so
you
will
learn
something
from
the
scourge
and
the
we
must
all
take
the
bitter
medicine
of
suffering
i
suppose
therefore
i
am
the
wiser
in
forcing
the
draught
on
myself
it
be
the
right
draught
and
do
not
require
another
and
still
bitterer
one
to
expel
the
effects
of
the
poison
i
have
no
faith
in
people
doctoring
themselves
either
physically
or
spiritually
am
not
my
own
physician
i
follow
the
rules
of
an
infallible
church
and
the
examples
of
her
canonised
saints
perhaps
they
may
have
known
what
was
best
for
but
as
for
you
and
me
here
in
the
year
however
we
shall
argue
on
for
ever
forgive
me
if
i
have
offended
you
am
not
offended
the
catholic
church
has
always
been
a
persecuted
one
walk
with
me
a
little
way
and
i
will
persecute
you
no
more
are
you
going
to
lancelot
had
not
the
heart
to
say
whither
my
father
ah
what
a
son
i
would
have
been
to
him
now
in
his
extreme
need
and
he
will
not
let
me
lancelot
is
it
impossible
to
move
him
i
do
not
want
to
go
home
again
to
live
there
i
could
not
face
that
though
i
longed
but
this
moment
to
do
it
i
can
not
face
the
pitying
looks
the
everlasting
suspicion
that
they
suspect
me
to
be
speaking
untruths
or
proselytising
in
cruel
and
unjust
lancelot
thought
of
a
certain
letter
of
luke
but
who
was
he
to
break
the
bruised
reed
i
will
not
see
him
better
thus
better
vanish
and
be
known
only
according
to
the
spirit
by
the
spirits
of
saints
and
confessors
and
their
successors
upon
earth
no
i
will
die
and
give
no
sign
must
see
somewhat
more
of
you
indeed
will
meet
you
here
then
two
hours
hence
near
that
house
even
along
the
way
which
leads
to
it
i
can
not
go
it
would
be
too
painful
too
painful
to
think
that
you
were
walking
towards
it
the
old
house
where
i
was
born
and
bred
and
i
shut
out
even
though
it
be
for
the
sake
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
the
sake
of
your
own
share
therein
my
poor
cousin
thought
lancelot
to
himself
is
a
very
different
matter
after
you
have
been
luke
could
not
get
out
the
word
home
claude
mellot
will
walk
part
of
the
way
thither
with
you
but
he
is
a
very
bad
companion
for
you
ca
help
that
i
can
not
live
and
i
am
going
to
turn
painter
it
is
not
the
road
in
which
to
find
a
fortune
but
still
the
very
live
somehow
i
suppose
i
am
going
this
very
afternoon
to
claude
mellot
and
enlist
i
sold
the
last
of
my
treasured
mss
to
a
magazine
this
morning
for
what
it
would
fetch
it
has
been
like
eating
one
own
children
but
at
least
they
have
fed
me

when
lancelot
reached
the
banker
a
letter
was
put
into
his
hand
it
bore
the
whitford
postmark
and
lavington
handwriting
he
tore
it
open
it
contained
a
letter
from
argemone
which
it
is
needless
to
say
he
read
before
her
mother
beloved
my
husband
yes
though
you
may
fancy
me
fickle
and
proud
i
will
call
you
so
to
the
last
for
were
i
fickle
i
could
have
saved
myself
the
agony
of
writing
this
and
as
for
pride
oh
how
that
darling
vice
has
been
crushed
out
of
me
i
have
rolled
at
my
mother
feet
with
bitter
tears
and
vain
entreaties
and
been
refused
and
yet
i
have
obeyed
her
after
all
we
must
write
to
each
other
no
more
this
one
last
letter
must
explain
the
forced
silence
which
has
been
driving
me
mad
with
fears
that
you
would
suspect
me
and
now
you
may
call
me
weak
but
it
is
your
love
which
has
made
me
strong
to
do
this
which
has
taught
me
to
see
with
new
intensity
my
duty
not
only
to
you
but
to
every
human
being
to
my
parents
by
this
alone
can
i
atone
to
them
for
all
my
past
undutifulness
let
me
then
thus
be
worthy
of
you
hope
that
by
this
submission
we
may
win
even
her
to
change
how
calmly
i
write
but
it
is
only
my
hand
that
is
calm

seem
to
understand
now
how
women
have
died
of
love
ay
that
indeed
would
be
blessed
for
then
my
spirit
would
seek
out
yours
and
hover
over
it
for
ever
farewell
beloved
and
let
me
hear
of
you
through
your
deeds
a
feeling
at

should

turned
carelessly

whose
blameless
respectability
thus

can
not
deceive
you
or
myself
by
saying
i
regret
that
providential
circumstances
should
have
been
permitted
to
break
off
a
connection
which
i
always
felt
to
be
most
unsuitable
and
i
rejoice
that
the
intercourse
my
dear

has
had
with

not
so
far
undermined
her
principles
as
to
prevent
her
yielding

most
filial
obedience
to
my
wishes
on
the
point
of
her
future
correspondence
with
you
hoping
that
all
that
has
occurred
will
be
truly
blessed
to
you
and
lead
your
thoughts
to
another
world
and
to
a
true
concern
for
the
safety
of
your
immortal
soul
remain
yours
truly
lavington
world
said
lancelot
to
himself
is
most
merciful
of
you
certainly
my
dear
madame
to
put
one
in
mind
of
the
existence
of
another
world
while
such
as
you
have
their
own
way
in
this
one
and
thrusting
the
latter
epistle
into
the
fire
he
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
what
had
he
lost
the
oftener
he
asked
himself
the
less
he
found
to
unman
him
argemone
letters
were
so
new
a
want
that
the
craving
for
them
was
not
yet
established
his
intense
imagination
resting
on
the
delicious
certainty
of
her
faith
seemed
ready
to
fill
the
silence
with
bright
hopes
and
noble
purposes
she
herself
had
said
that
he
would
see
her
soon
but
yet
but
yet
why
did
that
allusion
to
death
strike
chilly
through
him
they
were
but
words
a
melancholy
fancy
such
as
women
love
at
times
to
play
with
he
would
toss
it
from
him
at
least
here
was
another
reason
for
bestirring
himself
at
once
to
win
fame
in
the
noble
profession
he
had
chosen
and
yet
his
brain
reeled
as
he
went
upstairs
to
his
uncle
private
room
there
however
he
found
a
person
closeted
with
the
banker
whose
remarkable
appearance
drove
everything
else
out
of
his
mind
he
was
a
huge
shaggy
man
the
deep
melancholy
earnestness
of
whose
rugged
features
reminded
him
almost
ludicrously
of
one
of
bloodhounds
but
withal
there
was
a
tenderness
a
genial
though
covert
humour
playing
about
his
massive
features
which
awakened
in
lancelot
at
first
sight
a
fantastic
longing
to
open
his
whole
heart
to
him
he
was
dressed
like
a
foreigner
but
spoke
english
with
perfect
fluency
the
banker
sat
listening
quite
crestfallen
beneath
his
intense
and
melancholy
gaze
in
which
nevertheless
there
twinkled
some
rays
of
kindly
sympathy
was
all
those
foreign
railways
said
smith
pensively
it
serves
you
quite
right
answered
the
stranger
i
not
warn
you
of
the
folly
and
sin
of
sinking
capital
in
foreign
countries
while
english
land
was
crying
out
for
tillage
and
english
poor
for
employment
dear
friend
in
a
deprecatory
tone
was
the
best
possible
investment
i
could
make
pray
who
told
you
that
you
were
sent
into
the
world
to
make
investments
me
no
buts
or
i
wo
stir
a
finger
towards
helping
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
money
if
i
procure
it
for
you
till
i
can
pay
back
that
poor
fellow
fortune
said
the
banker
earnestly
pointing
to
lancelot
if
i
could
clear
my
conscience
of
that
i
would
not
care
if
i
starved
myself
hardly
if
my
own
children
did
like
a
man
answered
the
stranger
for
that
and
i
help
you
be
a
new
man
once
and
for
all
my
friend
do
even
make
this
younker
your
first
object
say
to
yourself
not
i
will
invest
this
money
where
it
shall
pay
me
most
but
i
will
invest
it
where
it
shall
give
most
employment
to
english
hands
and
produce
most
manufactures
for
english
bodies
in
short
seek
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
justice
with
this
money
of
yours
and
see
if
all
other
things
profits
and
suchlike
included
are
not
added
unto
you
you
are
certain
you
can
obtain
the
money
good
friend
the
begum
of
the
cannibal
islands
has
more
than
she
knows
what
to
do
with
and
she
owes
me
a
good
turn
you
know
are
you
jesting
about
now
i
never
tell
you
the
new
king
of
the
cannibal
islands
just
like
your
european
ones
ran
away
and
would
neither
govern
himself
nor
let
any
one
else
govern
so
one
morning
his
ministers
getting
impatient
ate
him
and
then
asked
my
advice
i
recommended
them
to
put
his
mother
on
the
throne
who
being
old
and
tough
would
run
less
danger
and
since
then
everything
has
gone
on
smoothly
as
anywhere
else
you
mad
thought
lancelot
to
himself
as
he
stared
at
the
speaker
face
i
am
not
mad
my
young
friend
quoth
he
facing
right
round
upon
him
as
if
he
had
divined
his
thoughts
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
speak
stammered
lancelot
abashed
at
a
pair
of
eyes
which
could
have
looked
down
the
boldest
mesmerist
in
three
seconds
am
perfectly
well
aware
that
you
did
not
i
must
have
some
talk
with
you
i
heard
a
good
deal
about
you
you
wrote
those
articles
in
the
review
about
george
sand
did
you
not
did
there
was
a
great
deal
of
noble
feeling
in
them
and
a
great
deal
of
abominable
nonsense
you
seem
to
be
very
anxious
to
reform
society
am
you
think
you
had
better
begin
by
reforming
yourself
sir
answered
lancelot
am
too
old
for
that
quibble
the
root
of
all
my
sins
has
been
selfishness
and
sloth
am
i
to
cure
them
by
becoming
still
more
selfish
and
slothful
what
part
of
myself
can
i
reform
except
my
actions
and
the
very
sin
of
my
actions
has
been
as
i
take
it
that
i
been
doing
nothing
to
reform
others
never
fighting
against
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
as
your
has
it
answered
the
stranger
with
a
quaint
smile
my
word
lancelot
interposed
the
banker
with
a
frightened
look
must
not
get
into
an
argument
you
must
be
more
respectful
you
do
know
to
whom
you
are
speaking
i
do
much
care
answered
he
is
really
too
grim
earnest
in
these
days
to
stand
on
ceremony
i
am
sick
of
blind
leaders
of
the
blind
of
respectable
preachers
to
the
respectable
who
drawl
out
trivialities
which
they
neither
practise
nor
wish
to
see
practised
i
had
enough
all
my
life
of
scribes
and
pharisees
in
white
cravats
laying
on
man
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
to
be
borne
and
then
not
touching
them
themselves
with
one
of
their
fingers
sir
roared
the
banker
while
the
stranger
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
burst
into
a
storm
of
laughter
my
word
friend
mammon
here
another
of
hans
andersen
ugly
ducks
really
do
not
mean
to
be
rude
said
lancelot
recollecting
himself
i
am
nearly
desperate
if
your
heart
is
in
the
right
place
you
will
understand
me
if
not
the
less
we
talk
to
each
other
the
better
true
answered
the
stranger
i
do
understand
you
and
if
as
i
hope
we
see
more
of
each
other
henceforth
we
will
see
if
we
can
not
solve
one
or
two
of
these
problems
between
us
at
this
moment
lancelot
was
summoned
downstairs
and
found
to
his
great
pleasure
tregarva
waiting
for
him
that
worthy
personage
bowed
to
lancelot
reverently
and
distantly
am
quite
ashamed
to
intrude
myself
upon
you
sir
but
i
could
not
rest
without
coming
to
ask
whether
you
have
had
any
news
he
broke
down
at
this
point
in
the
sentence
but
lancelot
understood
him
have
no
news
he
said
what
do
you
mean
by
standing
off
in
that
way
as
if
we
were
not
old
and
fast
friends
remember
i
am
as
poor
as
you
are
now
you
may
look
me
in
the
face
and
call
me
your
equal
if
you
will
or
your
inferior
i
shall
not
deny
it
me
sir
answered
tregarva
i
never
felt
what
a
real
substantial
thing
rank
is
as
i
have
since
this
sad
misfortune
of
yours
i
have
never
till
now
found
out
its
worthlessness
wrong
sir
you
are
wrong
look
at
the
difference
between
yourself
and
me
when
you
lost
all
you
have
and
seven
times
more
you
still
a
gentleman
no
man
can
take
that
from
you
you
may
look
the
proudest
duchess
in
the
land
in
the
face
and
claim
her
as
your
equal
while
i
sir
i
do
mean
though
to
talk
of
myself
but
suppose
that
you
had
loved
a
pious
and
a
beautiful
lady
and
among
all
your
worship
of
her
and
your
awe
of
her
had
felt
that
you
were
worthy
of
her
that
you
could
become
her
comforter
and
her
pride
and
her
joy
if
it
was
for
that
accursed
gulf
that
men
had
put
between
you
that
you
were
no
gentleman
that
you
did
know
how
to
walk
and
how
to
pronounce
and
when
to
speak
and
when
to
be
silent
not
even
how
to
handle
your
own
knife
and
fork
without
disgusting
her
or
how
to
keep
your
own
body
clean
and
sweet
ah
sir
i
see
it
now
as
i
never
did
before
what
a
wall
all
these
little
defects
build
up
round
a
poor
man
how
he
longs
and
struggles
to
show
himself
as
he
is
at
heart
and
can
not
till
he
feels
sometimes
as
if
he
was
enchanted
pent
up
like
folks
in
fairy
tales
in
the
body
of
some
dumb
beast
but
sir
he
went
on
with
a
concentrated
bitterness
which
lancelot
had
never
seen
in
him
before
because
this
gulf
which
rank
makes
is
such
a
deep
one
therefore
it
looks
to
me
all
the
more
devilish
not
that
i
want
to
pull
down
any
man
to
my
level
i
despise
my
own
level
too
much
i
want
to
rise
i
want
those
like
me
to
rise
with
me
let
the
rich
be
as
rich
as
they
i
and
those
like
me
covet
not
money
but
manners
why
should
not
the
workman
be
a
gentleman
and
a
workman
still
why
are
they
to
be
shut
out
from
all
that
is
beautiful
and
delicate
and
winning
and
stately
perhaps
said
lancelot
begin
to
understand
what
i
was
driving
at
on
that
night
of
the
revel
has
come
home
to
me
lately
sir
bitterly
enough
if
you
knew
what
had
gone
on
in
me
this
last
fortnight
you
would
know
that
i
had
cause
to
curse
the
state
of
things
which
brings
a
man
up
a
savage
against
his
will
and
cuts
him
off
as
if
he
were
an
ape
or
a
monster
from
those
for
whom
the
same
lord
died
and
on
whom
the
same
spirit
rests
is
that
god
will
sir
no
it
is
the
devil
will
those
whom
god
hath
joined
let
no
man
put
asunder
lancelot
coloured
for
he
remembered
with
how
much
less
reason
he
had
been
lately
invoking
in
his
own
cause
those
very
words
he
was
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
but
seeing
to
his
relief
that
tregarva
had
returned
to
his
usual
impassive
calm
he
forced
him
to
sit
down
and
began
questioning
him
as
to
his
own
prospects
and
employment
about
them
tregarva
seemed
hopeful
enough
he
had
found
out
a
wesleyan
minister
in
town
who
knew
him
and
had
by
his
means
after
assisting
for
a
week
or
two
in
the
london
city
mission
got
some
similar
appointment
in
a
large
manufacturing
town
of
the
state
of
things
he
spoke
more
sadly
than
ever
rich
can
not
guess
sir
how
high
is
rising
in
these
days
it
not
only
those
who
are
outwardly
poorest
who
long
for
change
the
middling
people
sir
the
small
town
shopkeepers
especially
are
nearly
past
all
patience
one
of
the
city
mission
assured
me
that
he
has
been
watching
them
these
several
years
past
and
that
nothing
could
beat
their
fortitude
and
industry
and
their
determination
to
stand
peaceably
by
law
and
order
but
yet
this
last
year
or
two
things
are
growing
too
bad
to
bear
do
what
they
will
they
can
not
get
their
bread
and
when
a
man
can
not
get
that
sir
what
do
you
think
is
the
reason
of
it
should
i
tell
sir
but
if
i
had
to
say
i
should
say
this
just
what
they
say
themselves
that
there
are
too
many
of
them
go
where
you
will
in
town
or
country
you
find
shops
struggling
for
a
custom
that
would
only
keep
up
one
and
so
they
forced
to
undersell
one
another
and
when
they
got
down
prices
all
they
can
by
fair
means
they
forced
to
get
them
down
lower
by
foul
to
sand
the
sugar
and
the
tea
and
put
satan
only
that
prompts
knows
what
into
the
bread
and
then
they
do
thrive
they
ca
thrive
god
curse
must
be
on
them
they
begin
by
trying
to
oust
each
other
and
eat
each
other
up
and
while
they
eating
up
their
neighbours
their
neighbours
eat
up
them
and
so
they
all
come
to
ruin
together
you
talk
like
mill
himself
tregarva
you
ought
to
have
been
a
political
economist
and
not
a
city
missionary
by
the
bye
i
do
like
that
profession
for
you
the
lord
work
sir
it
the
very
sending
to
the
gentiles
that
the
lord
promised
me
do
doubt
it
paul
but
you
are
meant
for
other
things
if
not
better
there
are
plenty
of
smaller
men
than
you
to
do
that
work
do
you
think
that
god
would
have
given
you
that
strength
that
brain
to
waste
on
a
work
which
could
be
done
without
them
those
limbs
would
certainly
be
good
capital
for
you
if
you
turned
a
live
model
at
the
academy
perhaps
you
better
be
mine
but
you
ca
even
be
that
if
you
go
to
manchester
the
giant
looked
hopelessly
down
at
his
huge
limbs
god
only
knows
what
use
they
are
of
just
now
but
as
for
the
brains
sir
in
much
learning
is
much
sorrow
one
had
much
better
work
than
read
i
find
if
i
read
much
more
about
what
men
might
be
and
are
not
and
what
english
soil
might
be
and
is
not
i
shall
go
mad
and
that
puts
me
in
mind
of
one
thing
i
came
here
for
though
like
a
poor
rude
country
fellow
as
i
am
i
clean
forgot
it
a
thinking
here
sir
you
given
me
a
sight
of
books
in
my
time
and
god
bless
you
for
it
but
now
i
hear
that
that
you
are
determined
to
be
a
poor
man
like
us
and
that
you
sha
be
while
paul
tregarva
has
ought
of
yours
so
i
just
brought
all
the
books
back
and
there
they
lie
in
the
hall
and
may
god
reward
you
for
the
loan
of
them
to
his
poor
child
and
so
sir
farewell
and
he
rose
to
go
paul
the
books
and
you
shall
never
part
i
say
sir
the
books
and
you
shall
never
part
we
two
can
never
part
and
a
sudden
impulse
flashed
over
we
will
not
part
paul
the
only
man
whom
i
utterly
love
and
trust
and
respect
on
the
face
of
god
earth
is
you
and
i
can
not
lose
sight
of
you
if
we
are
to
earn
our
bread
let
us
earn
it
together
if
we
are
to
endure
poverty
and
sorrow
and
struggle
to
find
out
the
way
of
bettering
these
wretched
millions
round
us
let
us
learn
our
lesson
together
and
help
each
other
to
spell
it
out
you
mean
what
you
say
asked
paul
slowly
do
i
say
what
you
say
where
thou
goest
i
will
go
and
where
thou
lodgest
i
will
lodge
come
what
will
i
will
be
your
servant
for
good
luck
or
bad
for
ever
equal
paul
not
my
servant
know
my
place
sir
when
i
am
as
learned
and
as
as
you
i
shall
not
refuse
to
call
myself
your
equal
and
the
sooner
that
day
comes
the
better
i
shall
be
pleased
till
then
i
am
your
friend
and
your
brother
but
i
am
your
scholar
too
and
i
shall
not
set
up
myself
against
my
master
have
learnt
more
of
you
paul
than
ever
you
have
learnt
of
me
but
be
it
as
you
will
only
whatever
you
may
call
yourself
we
must
eat
at
the
same
table
live
in
the
same
room
and
share
alike
all
this
world
good
things
or
we
shall
have
no
right
to
share
together
this
world
bad
things
if
that
is
your
bargain
there
is
my
hand
on
it
quoth
tregarva
and
the
two
young
men
joined
hands
in
that
sacred
bond
now
growing
rarer
and
rarer
year
by
year
the
utter
friendship
of
two
equal
manful
hearts
now
sir
i
have
promised
and
you
would
have
me
keep
my
promise
to
go
and
work
for
the
city
mission
in
manchester
at
least
for
the
next
month
till
a
young
man
place
who
has
just
left
is
filled
up
will
you
let
me
go
for
that
time
and
then
if
you
hold
your
present
mind
we
will
join
home
and
fortunes
thenceforth
and
go
wherever
the
lord
shall
send
us
there
work
enough
of
his
waiting
to
be
done
i
do
doubt
but
if
we
are
willing
and
able
he
will
set
us
about
the
thing
we
meant
for
as
lancelot
opened
the
door
for
him
he
lingered
on
the
steps
and
grasping
his
hand
said
in
a
low
earnest
voice
lord
be
with
you
sir
be
sure
that
he
has
mighty
things
in
store
for
you
or
he
would
not
have
brought
you
so
low
in
the
days
of
your
youth
so
as
john
bunyan
has
it
went
on
his
way
and
lancelot
saw
him
no
more
till
but
i
must
not
outrun
the
order
of
time
after
all
this
visit
came
to
lancelot
timely
it
had
roused
him
to
hope
and
turned
off
his
feelings
from
the
startling
news
he
had
just
heard
he
stepped
along
arm
in
arm
with
luke
cheerful
and
and
as
he
thought
of
tregarva
complaints
beautiful
he
said
to
himself
shall
have
it
at
least
they
shall
be
awakened
to
feel
their
need
of
it
their
right
to
it
what
a
high
destiny
to
be
the
artist
of
the
people
to
devote
one
powers
of
painting
not
to
mimicking
obsolete
legends
pagan
or
popish
but
to
representing
to
the
working
men
of
england
the
triumphs
of
the
past
and
the
yet
greater
triumphs
of
the
future
luke
began
at
once
questioning
him
about
his
father
is
he
contrite
and
humbled
does
he
see
that
he
has
sinned
what
is
not
for
us
to
judge
but
surely
it
must
have
been
some
sin
or
other
of
his
which
has
drawn
down
such
a
sore
judgment
on
him
lancelot
smiled
but
luke
went
on
not
perceiving
him
we
can
not
find
out
for
him
nor
has
he
alas
as
a
protestant
much
likelihood
of
finding
out
for
himself
in
our
holy
church
he
would
have
been
compelled
to
discriminate
his
faults
by
methodic
and
lay
them
one
by
one
before
his
priest
for
advice
and
pardon
and
so
start
a
new
and
free
man
once
more
you
think
asked
lancelot
with
a
smile
he
who
will
not
confess
his
faults
either
to
god
or
to
himself
would
confess
them
to
man
and
would
his
priest
honestly
tell
him
what
he
really
wants
to
know
which
sin
of
his
has
called
down
this
judgment
it
would
be
imputed
i
suppose
to
some
vague
generality
to
inattention
to
religious
duties
to
idolatry
of
the
world
and
so
forth
but
a
romish
priest
would
be
the
last
person
i
should
think
who
could
tell
him
fairly
in
the
present
case
the
cause
of
his
affliction
and
i
question
whether
he
would
give
a
patient
hearing
to
any
one
who
told
it
him
so
though
indeed
i
have
remarked
that
people
are
perfectly
willing
to
be
told
they
are
miserable
sinners
and
to
confess
themselves
such
in
a
general
way
but
if
the
preacher
once
begins
to
specify
to
fix
on
any
particular
act
or
habit
he
is
accused
of
personality
or
uncharitableness
his
hearers
are
ready
to
confess
guilty
to
any
sin
but
the
very
one
with
which
he
charges
them
but
surely
this
is
just
what
i
am
urging
against
you
protestants
just
what
the
catholic
use
of
confession
obviates
to
do
so
you
mean
answered
lancelot
what
if
your
religion
preaches
formally
that
which
only
remains
in
our
religion
as
a
superstition
that
those
judgments
of
god
as
you
call
them
are
not
judgments
at
all
in
any
fair
use
of
the
word
but
capricious
acts
of
punishment
on
the
part
of
heaven
which
have
no
more
reference
to
the
fault
which
provokes
them
than
if
you
cut
off
a
man
finger
because
he
made
a
bad
use
of
his
tongue
that
is
part
but
only
a
part
of
what
i
meant
just
now
by
saying
that
people
represent
god
as
capricious
proud
revengeful
do
not
protestants
themselves
confess
that
our
sins
provoke
god
anger
common
creed
when
it
talks
rightly
of
god
as
one
who
has
no
passions
ought
to
make
you
speak
more
reverently
of
the
possibility
of
any
act
of
ours
disturbing
the
everlasting
equanimity
of
the
absolute
love
why
will
men
so
often
impute
to
god
the
miseries
which
they
bring
upon
themselves
i
suppose
their
pride
makes
them
more
willing
to
confess
themselves
sinners
than
fools
my
friend
they
will
not
remember
that
it
is
of
their
pleasant
vices
that
god
makes
whips
to
scourge
them
oh
i
at
least
have
felt
the
deep
wisdom
of
that
saying
of
wilhelm
meister
harper
that
it
is
voices
from
the
depth
of
nature
borne
which
woe
upon
the
guilty
head
proclaim
of
nature
of
those
eternal
laws
of
hers
which
we
daily
break
yes
it
is
not
because
god
temper
changes
but
because
god
universe
is
unchangeable
that
such
as
i
such
as
your
poor
father
having
sown
the
wind
must
reap
the
whirlwind
i
have
fed
my
with
luxuries
and
not
with
virtue
and
losing
them
have
nothing
left
he
has
sold
himself
to
a
system
which
is
its
own
punishment
and
yet
the
last
place
in
which
he
will
look
for
the
cause
of
his
misery
is
in
that
very
to
which
he
now
clings
as
frantically
as
ever
but
so
it
is
throughout
the
world
only
look
down
over
that
at
that
huge
sewer
vomiting
its
pestilential
riches
across
the
mud
there
it
runs
and
will
run
hurrying
to
the
sea
vast
stores
of
wealth
elaborated
by
nature
chemistry
into
the
ready
materials
of
food
which
proclaim
too
by
their
own
foul
smell
god
will
that
they
should
be
buried
out
of
sight
in
the
fruitful
grave
of
earth
there
it
runs
turning
them
all
into
the
seeds
of
pestilence
filth
and
and
then
when
it
obeys
the
laws
which
we
despise
and
the
pestilence
is
come
at
last
men
will
pray
against
it
and
confess
it
to
be
a
judgment
for
their
sins
but
if
you
ask
what
sin
people
will
talk
about
les
voiles
as
fourier
says
and
tell
you
that
it
is
presumptuous
to
pry
into
god
secret
counsels
unless
perhaps
some
fanatic
should
inform
you
that
the
cholera
has
been
drawn
down
on
the
poor
by
the
endowment
of
maynooth
by
the
rich
is
most
fearful
indeed
to
think
that
these
diseases
should
be
confined
to
the
poor
that
a
man
should
be
exposed
to
cholera
typhus
and
a
host
of
attendant
diseases
simply
because
he
is
born
into
the
world
an
artisan
while
the
rich
by
the
mere
fact
of
money
are
exempt
from
such
curses
except
when
they
come
in
contact
with
those
whom
they
call
on
sunday
their
brethren
and
on
week
days
the
masses
heaven
that
you
do
see
that
that
in
a
country
calling
itself
civilised
and
christian
pestilence
should
be
the
peculiar
heritage
of
the
poor
it
is
past
all
comment
yet
are
not
these
pestilences
a
judgment
even
on
them
for
their
dirt
and
profligacy
how
should
they
be
clean
without
water
and
how
can
you
wonder
if
their
appetites
sickened
with
filth
and
crave
after
the
for
temporary
strength
and
then
for
temporary
forgetfulness
every
london
doctor
knows
that
i
speak
the
truth
would
that
every
london
preacher
would
tell
that
truth
from
his
pulpit
would
you
too
say
that
god
punishes
one
class
for
the
sins
of
another
would
say
answered
lancelot
half
aside
he
may
be
punishing
them
for
not
demanding
their
right
to
live
like
human
beings
to
all
those
social
circumstances
which
shall
not
make
their
children
life
one
long
disease
but
are
not
these
pestilences
a
judgment
on
the
rich
too
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
are
they
not
the
broad
unmistakable
seal
to
god
opinion
of
a
state
of
society
which
confesses
its
economic
relations
to
be
so
utterly
rotten
and
confused
that
it
actually
can
not
afford
to
save
yearly
millions
of
pounds
worth
of
the
materials
of
food
not
to
mention
thousands
of
human
lives
is
not
every
man
who
allows
such
things
hastening
the
ruin
of
the
society
in
which
he
lives
by
helping
to
foster
the
indignation
and
fury
of
its
victims
look
at
that
group
of
stunted
haggard
artisans
who
are
passing
us
what
if
one
day
they
should
call
to
account
the
landlords
whose
coveteousness
and
ignorance
make
their
dwellings
hells
on
earth
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
artist
house
luke
refused
to
had
done
with
this
world
and
the
painters
of
this
and
with
a
tearful
last
farewell
he
turned
away
up
the
street
leaving
lancelot
to
gaze
at
his
slow
painful
steps
and
abject
mien
thought
lancelot
is
the
end
of
your
anthropology
at
first
your
ideal
man
is
an
angel
but
your
angel
is
merely
an
unsexed
woman
and
so
you
are
forced
to
go
back
to
the
humanity
after
all
but
to
a
woman
not
a
man
and
this
in
the
nineteenth
century
when
men
are
telling
us
that
the
poetic
and
enthusiastic
have
become
impossible
and
that
the
only
possible
state
of
the
world
henceforward
will
be
a
universal
hive
of
the
religion
a
vast
prosaic
cockaigne
of
steam
mills
for
grinding
sausages
for
those
who
can
get
at
them
and
all
the
while
in
spite
of
all
manchester
schools
and
high
and
dry
orthodox
schools
here
are
the
strangest
phantasms
new
and
old
sane
and
insane
starting
up
suddenly
into
live
practical
power
to
give
their
prosaic
theories
the
lie
popish
conversions
mormonisms
mesmerisms
californias
continental
revolutions
paris
days
of
june
ye
hypocrites
ye
can
discern
the
face
of
the
sky
and
yet
ye
can
not
discern
the
signs
of
this
time
he
was
ushered
upstairs
to
the
door
of
his
studio
at
which
he
knocked
and
was
answered
by
a
loud
in
lancelot
heard
a
rustle
as
he
entered
and
caught
sight
of
a
most
charming
little
white
foot
retreating
hastily
through
the
folding
doors
into
the
inner
room
the
artist
who
was
seated
at
his
easel
held
up
his
brush
as
a
signal
of
silence
and
did
not
even
raise
his
eyes
till
he
had
finished
the
touches
on
which
he
was
engaged
now
what
do
i
see
the
last
man
i
should
have
expected
i
thought
you
were
far
down
in
the
country
and
what
brings
you
to
me
with
such
serious
and
looks
am
a
penniless
youth
to
my
last
shilling
and
i
want
to
turn
artist
ye
gracious
powers
come
to
my
arms
brother
at
last
with
me
in
the
holy
order
of
those
who
must
work
or
starve
long
have
i
wept
in
secret
over
the
pernicious
fulness
of
your
purse
your
tears
then
now
said
lancelot
i
neither
have
ten
pounds
in
the
world
nor
intend
to
have
till
i
can
earn
them
ran
on
mellot
you
shall
be
an
artist
indeed
you
shall
stay
with
me
and
become
the
english
michael
angelo
or
if
you
are
fool
enough
go
to
rome
and
utterly
eclipse
overbeck
and
throw
schadow
for
ever
into
the
shade
fine
you
a
supper
said
lancelot
that
execrable
attempt
at
a
pun
here
sabina
send
to
covent
garden
for
huge
nosegays
and
get
out
the
best
bottle
of
burgundy
we
will
pass
an
evening
worthy
of
horace
and
with
garlands
and
libations
honour
the
muse
of
painting
dog
said
lancelot
all
your
cant
about
poverty
as
he
spoke
the
folding
doors
opened
and
an
exquisite
little
brunette
danced
in
from
the
inner
room
in
which
by
the
bye
had
been
going
on
all
the
while
a
suspicious
rustling
as
of
garments
hastily
arranged
she
was
dressed
gracefully
in
a
loose
french
down
which
lancelot
eye
glanced
towards
the
little
foot
which
however
was
now
hidden
in
a
tiny
velvet
slipper
the
artist
wife
was
a
real
beauty
though
without
a
single
perfect
feature
except
a
most
delicious
little
mouth
a
skin
like
velvet
and
clear
brown
eyes
from
which
beamed
earnest
simplicity
and
arch
good
humour
she
darted
forward
to
her
husband
friend
while
her
rippling
brown
hair
fantastically
arranged
fluttered
about
her
neck
and
seizing
lancelot
hands
successively
in
both
of
hers
broke
out
in
an
accent
prettily
tinged
with
french
delightful
and
so
you
are
really
going
to
turn
painter
and
i
have
longed
so
to
be
introduced
to
you
claude
has
been
raving
about
you
these
two
years
you
already
seem
to
me
the
oldest
friend
in
the
world
you
must
not
go
to
rome
we
shall
keep
you
lancelot
positively
you
must
come
and
live
with
us
we
shall
be
the
happiest
trio
in
london
i
will
make
you
so
comfortable
you
must
let
me
cater
for
you
cook
for
you
be
my
study
sometimes
said
lancelot
smiling
she
said
blushing
and
shaking
her
pretty
little
fist
at
claude
madcap
how
he
has
betrayed
me
when
he
is
at
his
easel
he
is
so
in
the
seventh
heaven
that
he
sees
nothing
thinks
of
nothing
but
his
own
dreams
at
this
moment
a
heavy
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
the
door
opened
and
there
entered
to
lancelot
astonishment
the
stranger
who
had
just
puzzled
him
so
much
at
his
uncle
claude
rose
reverentially
and
came
forward
but
sabina
was
beforehand
with
him
and
running
up
to
her
visitor
kissed
his
hand
again
and
again
almost
kneeling
to
him
dear
master
she
cried
a
delightful
surprise
we
have
not
seen
you
this
fortnight
past
and
gave
you
up
for
lost
do
you
come
from
my
dear
master
asked
claude
going
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
and
from
walking
up
and
down
in
it
answered
he
smiling
and
laying
his
finger
on
his
lips
dear
pupils
and
you
are
both
well
and
happy
and
doubly
delighted
at
your
presence
for
your
advice
will
come
in
a
providential
moment
for
my
friend
here
said
the
strange
man
met
once
more
so
you
are
going
to
turn
painter
he
bent
a
severe
and
searching
look
on
lancelot
have
a
painter
face
young
man
he
said
on
and
prosper
what
branch
of
art
do
you
intend
to
study
ancient
italian
painters
as
my
first
step
it
is
not
four
hundred
years
since
perugino
died
but
i
should
suppose
you
do
not
intend
to
ignore
classic
art
have
divined
rightly
i
wish
in
the
study
of
the
antique
to
arrive
at
the
primeval
laws
of
unfallen
human
beauty
phidias
and
praxiteles
then
so
primeval
the
world
had
lasted
many
a
thousand
years
before
their
turn
came
if
you
intend
to
begin
at
the
beginning
why
not
go
back
at
once
to
the
garden
of
eden
and
there
study
the
true
antique
there
were
but
any
relics
of
it
said
lancelot
puzzled
and
laughing
would
find
it
very
near
you
young
man
if
you
had
but
eyes
to
see
it
claude
mellot
laughed
significantly
and
sabina
clapped
her
little
hands
till
you
take
him
with
you
master
and
show
it
to
him
he
must
needs
be
content
with
the
royal
academy
and
the
elgin
marbles
to
what
branch
of
painting
pray
said
the
master
to
lancelot
you
apply
your
knowledge
of
the
antique
will
you
like
this
foolish
fellow
here
with
a
kindly
glance
at
claude
yourself
away
on
nymphs
and
venuses
in
which
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
believes
art
as
the
highest
answered
lancelot
my
ambition
is
well
to
aim
at
the
highest
but
only
when
it
is
possible
for
us
and
how
can
such
a
school
exist
in
england
now
you
english
must
learn
to
understand
your
own
history
before
you
paint
it
rather
follow
in
the
steps
of
your
turners
and
landseers
and
standfields
and
creswicks
and
add
your
contribution
to
the
present
noble
school
of
naturalist
painters
that
is
the
niche
in
the
temple
which
god
has
set
you
english
to
fill
up
just
now
these
men
patient
reverent
faith
in
nature
as
they
see
her
their
knowledge
that
the
ideal
is
neither
to
be
invented
nor
abstracted
but
found
and
left
where
god
has
put
it
and
where
alone
it
can
be
represented
in
actual
and
individual
phenomena
in
these
lies
an
honest
development
of
the
true
idea
of
protestantism
which
is
paving
the
way
to
the
mesothetic
art
of
the
future
said
sabina
a
single
word
that
we
poor
creatures
can
understand
but
our
hero
who
always
took
a
virtuous
delight
in
hearing
what
he
could
not
comprehend
went
on
to
question
the
orator
then
is
the
true
idea
of
protestantism
said
he
universal
symbolism
and
dignity
of
matter
whether
in
man
or
nature
the
puritans
inconsistent
with
themselves
and
with
protestantism
and
therefore
god
would
not
allow
them
to
proceed
yet
their
repudiation
of
all
art
was
better
than
the
which
romanism
bestows
on
it
in
the
meagre
eclecticism
of
the
ancient
religious
schools
and
of
your
modern
overbecks
and
pugins
the
only
really
wholesome
designer
of
great
power
whom
i
have
seen
in
germany
is
kaulbach
and
perhaps
every
one
would
not
agree
with
my
reasons
for
admiring
him
in
this
whitewashed
age
but
you
young
sir
were
meant
for
better
things
than
art
many
young
geniuses
have
an
early
hankering
as
goethe
had
to
turn
painters
it
seems
the
shortest
and
easiest
method
of
embodying
their
conceptions
in
visible
form
but
they
get
wiser
afterwards
when
they
find
in
themselves
thoughts
that
can
not
be
laid
upon
the
canvas
come
with
me
i
like
striking
while
the
iron
is
hot
walk
with
me
towards
my
lodgings
and
we
will
discuss
this
weighty
matter
and
with
a
gay
farewell
to
the
adoring
little
sabina
he
passed
an
iron
arm
through
lancelot
and
marched
him
down
into
the
street
lancelot
was
surprised
and
almost
nettled
at
the
sudden
influence
which
he
found
this
quaint
personage
was
exerting
over
him
but
he
had
of
late
tasted
the
high
delight
of
feeling
himself
under
the
guidance
of
a
superior
mind
and
longed
to
enjoy
it
once
more
perhaps
they
were
reminiscences
of
this
kind
which
stirred
in
him
the
strange
fancy
of
a
connection
almost
of
a
likeness
between
his
new
acquaintance
and
argemone
he
asked
humbly
enough
why
art
was
to
be
a
forbidden
path
to
him
you
are
an
englishman
and
a
man
of
uncommon
talent
unless
your
physiognomy
belies
you
and
one
too
for
whom
god
has
strange
things
in
store
or
he
would
not
have
so
suddenly
and
strangely
overthrown
you
lancelot
started
he
remembered
that
tregarva
had
said
just
the
same
thing
to
him
that
very
morning
and
the
to
him
strange
coincidence
sank
deep
into
his
heart
must
be
a
politician
the
stranger
went
on
are
bound
to
it
as
your
birthright
it
has
been
england
privilege
hitherto
to
solve
all
political
questions
as
they
arise
for
the
rest
of
the
world
it
is
her
duty
now
here
or
nowhere
must
the
solution
be
attempted
of
those
social
problems
which
are
convulsing
more
and
more
all
christendom
she
can
not
afford
to
waste
brains
like
yours
while
in
thousands
of
reeking
alleys
such
as
that
one
opposite
us
heathens
and
savages
are
demanding
the
rights
of
citizenship
whether
they
be
right
or
wrong
is
what
you
and
such
as
you
have
to
find
out
at
this
day
silent
and
thoughtful
lancelot
walked
on
by
his
side
is
become
of
your
friend
tregarva
i
met
him
this
morning
after
he
parted
from
you
and
had
some
talk
with
him
i
was
sorely
minded
to
enlist
him
perhaps
i
shall
in
the
meantime
i
shall
busy
myself
with
you
what
way
asked
lancelot
strange
sir
of
whose
name
much
less
of
whose
occupation
i
can
gain
no
tidings
name
for
the
time
being
is
barnakill
and
as
for
business
as
it
is
your
english
fashion
to
call
new
things
obstinately
by
old
names
careless
whether
they
apply
or
not
you
may
consider
me
as
a
which
trade
indeed
i
follow
though
i
am
no
more
like
the
popular
ones
than
your
present
glorious
constitution
is
like
william
the
third
or
overbeck
high
art
like
fra
angelico
farewell
when
i
want
you
which
will
be
most
likely
when
you
want
me
i
shall
find
you
again
the
evening
was
passed
as
claude
had
promised
in
a
truly
horatian
manner
sabina
was
most
piquante
and
claude
interspersed
his
genial
and
enthusiastic
eloquence
with
various
wise
saws
of
prophet
why
on
earth
quoth
lancelot
at
last
you
call
him
a
prophet
he
is
one
it
his
business
his
calling
he
gets
his
living
thereby
as
the
showman
did
by
his
elephant
what
does
he
foretell
son
of
the
earth
and
you
went
to
cambridge
are
reported
to
have
gone
in
for
the
thing
or
phantom
called
the
tripos
and
taken
a
first
class
did
you
ever
look
out
the
word
prophetes
in
liddell
and
scott
what
do
you
know
about
liddell
and
scott
thank
goodness
i
never
had
time
to
waste
over
the
crooked
letters
but
i
have
heard
say
that
prophetes
means
not
a
foreteller
but
an
one
who
declares
the
will
of
a
deity
and
interprets
his
oracles
is
it
not
so
that
he
became
a
foreteller
among
heathens
at
least
as
i
consider
among
all
peoples
whatsoever
because
knowing
the
real
bearing
of
what
had
happened
and
what
was
happening
he
could
discern
the
signs
of
the
times
and
so
had
what
the
world
calls
a
shrewd
guess
what
i
like
a
pantheist
as
i
am
denominated
should
call
a
divine
and
inspired
foresight
of
what
was
going
to
happen
new
notion
and
a
pleasant
one
for
it
looks
something
like
a
law
am
no
scollard
as
they
would
say
in
whitford
you
know
but
it
has
often
struck
me
that
if
folks
would
but
believe
that
the
apostles
talked
not
such
very
bad
greek
and
had
some
slight
notion
of
the
received
meaning
of
the
words
they
used
and
of
the
absurdity
of
using
the
same
term
to
express
nineteen
different
things
the
new
testament
would
be
found
to
be
a
much
simpler
and
more
severely
philosophic
book
than
theologians
i
call
them
fancy
on
earth
did
you
get
all
this
wisdom
or
foolishness
the
prophet
a
fortnight
ago
is
this
prophet
i
will
know
you
will
know
more
than
i
do
sabina
light
my
meerschaum
there
a
darling
it
will
taste
the
sweeter
after
your
lips
and
claude
laid
his
delicate
limbs
upon
the
sofa
and
looked
the
very
picture
of
luxurious
nonchalance
is
he
you
pitiless
wretch
hebe
fill
our
prometheus
vinctus
another
glass
of
burgundy
and
find
your
guitar
to
silence
him
was
the
ocean
nymphs
who
came
to
comfort
prometheus
and
unsandalled
too
if
i
recollect
right
said
lancelot
smiling
at
sabina
now
if
he
will
not
tell
me
perhaps
you
will
sabina
only
blushed
and
laughed
mysteriously
surely
are
intimate
with
him
claude
when
and
where
did
you
meet
him
first
years
ago
on
the
barricades
of
the
three
days
in
the
charming
little
pandemonium
called
paris
he
picked
me
out
of
a
gutter
a
boy
of
fifteen
with
a
through
my
body
mended
me
and
sent
me
to
a
painter
the
next
sejour
i
had
with
him
began
in
sight
of
the
demawend
sabina
perhaps
you
might
like
to
relate
to
smith
that
interview
and
the
circumstances
under
which
you
made
your
first
sketch
of
that
magnificent
and
volcano
sabina
blushed
again
this
time
scarlet
and
to
lancelot
astonishment
pulled
off
her
slipper
and
brandishing
it
daintily
uttered
some
unintelligible
threat
in
an
oriental
language
at
the
laughing
claude
you
must
have
been
in
the
east
not
do
you
think
that
figure
and
that
walk
were
picked
up
in
england
ay
in
the
east
and
why
not
elsewhere
do
you
think
i
got
my
knowledge
of
the
human
figure
from
the
in
the
royal
academy
certainly
have
always
had
my
doubts
of
it
you
are
the
only
man
i
know
who
can
paint
muscle
in
motion
i
am
almost
the
only
man
in
england
who
has
ever
seen
it
artists
should
go
to
the
cannibal
islands
for
fait
le
grand
tour
i
should
not
wonder
if
the
prophet
made
you
take
it
would
be
very
much
as
i
chose
otherwise
do
you
mean
if
he
wills
you
to
go
i
defy
you
to
stay
eh
sabina
you
are
a
very
mysterious
pair
and
a
very
charming
one
we
think
ourselves
as
to
the
and
as
for
the
mystery
omnia
exeunt
in
mysterium
says
somebody
if
he
do
ought
to
seeing
that
it
is
so
you
will
be
a
mystery
some
day
and
a
myth
and
a
thousand
years
hence
pious
old
ladies
will
be
pulling
caps
as
to
whether
you
were
a
saint
or
a
devil
and
whether
you
did
really
work
miracles
or
not
as
corroborations
of
your
illumination
on
social
yes
you
will
have
to
submit
and
see
bogy
and
enter
the
eleusinian
mysteries
eh
sabina
dear
claude
what
between
the
burgundy
and
your
usual
foolishness
you
seem
very
much
inclined
to
divulge
the
eleusinian
mysteries
ca
well
do
that
my
beauty
seeing
that
if
you
recollect
we
were
both
turned
back
at
the
vestibule
for
a
pair
of
naughty
children
as
we
are
be
quiet
and
let
me
enjoy
for
once
my
woman
right
to
the
last
word
and
in
this
hopeful
state
of
mystification
lancelot
went
home
and
dreamt
of
argemone
his
uncle
would
and
indeed
as
it
seemed
could
give
him
very
little
information
on
the
question
which
had
so
excited
his
curiosity
he
had
met
the
man
in
india
many
years
before
had
received
there
from
him
most
important
kindnesses
and
considered
him
from
experience
of
oracular
wisdom
he
seemed
to
have
an
unlimited
command
of
money
though
most
frugal
in
his
private
habits
visited
england
for
a
short
time
every
few
years
and
always
under
a
different
appellation
but
as
for
his
real
name
habitation
or
business
here
or
at
home
the
good
banker
knew
nothing
except
that
whenever
questioned
on
them
he
wandered
off
into
pantagruelist
jokes
and
ended
in
so
that
lancelot
was
fain
to
give
up
his
questions
and
content
himself
with
longing
for
the
reappearance
of
this
inexplicable
sage
chapter
xvi
once
in
a
way
a
few
mornings
afterwards
lancelot
as
he
glanced
his
eye
over
the
columns
of
the
times
stopped
short
at
the
beloved
name
of
whitford
to
his
disgust
and
disappointment
it
only
occurred
in
one
of
those
miserable
cases
now
of
weekly
occurrence
of
concealing
the
birth
of
a
child
he
was
turning
from
it
when
he
saw
bracebridge
name
another
look
sufficed
to
show
him
that
he
ought
to
go
at
once
to
the
colonel
who
had
returned
the
day
before
from
norway
a
few
minutes
brought
him
to
his
friend
lodging
but
the
times
had
arrived
there
before
him
bracebridge
was
sitting
over
his
untasted
breakfast
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
not
speak
to
me
he
said
without
looking
up
was
right
of
you
to
come
kind
of
you
but
it
is
too
late
he
started
and
looked
wildly
round
him
as
if
listening
for
some
sound
which
he
expected
and
then
laid
his
head
down
on
the
table
lancelot
turned
to
go
do
not
leave
me
not
alone
for
god
sake
not
alone
lancelot
sat
down
there
was
a
fearful
alteration
in
bracebridge
his
old
keen
look
had
vanished
he
was
haggard
almost
abject
his
limbs
looked
quite
shrunk
and
powerless
as
he
rested
his
head
on
the
table
before
him
and
murmured
incoherently
from
time
to
time
own
child
and
i
never
shall
have
another
no
second
chance
for
those
who
oh
mary
mary
you
might
have
waited
you
might
have
trusted
me
and
why
should
you
ay
why
indeed
and
such
a
pretty
baby
too
just
like
his
father
lancelot
laid
his
hand
kindly
on
his
shoulder
dearest
bracebridge
the
evidence
proves
that
the
child
was
born
dead
lie
he
said
fiercely
starting
up
cried
twice
after
it
was
born
lancelot
stood
heard
it
last
night
and
the
night
before
that
and
the
night
before
that
again
under
my
pillow
shrieking
stifling
two
little
squeaks
like
a
caught
hare
and
i
tore
the
pillows
off
it
i
did
and
once
i
saw
it
and
it
had
beautiful
black
eyes
just
like
its
father
just
like
a
little
miniature
that
used
to
lie
on
my
mother
table
when
i
knelt
at
her
knee
before
they
sent
me
out
to
see
life
and
eton
and
the
army
and
crockford
and
newmarket
and
fine
gentlemen
and
fine
ladies
and
luxury
and
flattery
brought
me
to
this
oh
father
father
was
that
the
only
way
to
make
a
gentleman
of
your
son
there
it
is
again
do
you
hear
it
under
the
sofa
cushions
tear
them
off
curse
you
save
it
and
with
a
fearful
oath
the
wretched
man
sent
lancelot
staggering
across
the
room
and
madly
tore
up
the
cushions
a
long
postman
knock
at
the
he
suddenly
rose
up
quite
collected
letter
i
knew
it
would
come
she
need
not
have
written
it
i
know
what
is
in
it
the
servant
step
came
up
the
stairs
poor
bracebridge
turned
to
lancelot
with
something
of
his
own
stately
determination
must
be
alone
when
i
receive
this
letter
stay
here
and
with
compressed
lips
and
fixed
eyes
he
stalked
out
at
the
door
and
shut
it
lancelot
heard
him
stop
then
the
servant
footsteps
down
the
stairs
then
the
colonel
treading
slowly
and
heavily
went
step
by
step
up
to
the
room
above
he
shut
that
door
too
a
dead
silence
followed
lancelot
stood
in
fearful
suspense
and
held
his
breath
to
listen
perhaps
he
had
fainted
no
for
then
he
would
have
heard
a
fall
perhaps
he
had
fallen
on
the
bed
he
would
go
and
see
no
he
would
wait
a
little
longer
perhaps
he
was
praying
he
had
told
lancelot
to
pray
once
he
dared
not
interrupt
him
now
a
slight
stir
a
noise
as
of
an
opening
box
thank
god
he
was
at
least
alive
nonsense
why
should
he
not
be
alive
what
could
happen
to
him
and
yet
he
knew
that
something
was
going
to
happen
the
silence
was
ominous
unbearable
the
air
of
the
room
felt
heavy
and
stifling
as
if
a
thunderstorm
were
about
to
burst
he
longed
to
hear
the
man
raging
and
stamping
and
yet
he
could
not
connect
the
thought
of
one
so
gay
and
full
of
gallant
life
with
the
terrible
dread
that
was
creeping
over
him
with
the
terrible
scene
which
he
had
just
witnessed
it
must
be
all
a
temporary
mistake
a
hideous
dream
which
the
next
post
would
sweep
away
he
would
go
and
tell
him
so
no
he
could
not
stir
his
limbs
seemed
leaden
his
feet
felt
rooted
to
the
ground
as
in
long
nightmare
and
still
the
intolerable
silence
brooded
overhead
what
broke
it
a
dull
stifled
report
as
of
a
pistol
fired
against
the
ground
a
heavy
fall
and
again
the
silence
of
death
he
rushed
upstairs
a
corpse
lay
on
its
face
upon
the
floor
and
from
among
its
hair
a
crimson
thread
crept
slowly
across
the
carpet
it
was
all
over
he
bent
over
the
head
but
one
look
was
sufficient
he
did
not
try
to
lift
it
up
on
the
table
lay
the
fatal
letter
lancelot
knew
that
he
had
a
right
to
read
it
it
was
scrawled
but
there
were
no
on
the
paper
i
am
in
prison
and
where
are
you
cruel
man
where
were
you
all
those
miserable
weeks
while
i
was
coming
nearer
and
nearer
to
my
shame
murdering
dumb
beasts
in
foreign
lands
you
have
murdered
more
than
them
how
i
loved
you
once
how
i
hate
you
now
but
i
have
my
revenge
your
baby
cried
twice
after
it
was
born
lancelot
tore
the
letter
into
a
hundred
pieces
and
swallowed
them
for
every
foot
in
the
house
was
on
the
stairs
so
there
was
terror
and
confusion
and
running
in
and
out
but
there
were
no
wet
eyes
there
except
those
of
bracebridge
groom
who
threw
himself
on
the
body
and
would
not
stir
and
then
there
was
a
coroner
inquest
and
it
came
out
in
the
evidence
how
deceased
had
been
for
several
days
very
much
depressed
and
had
talked
of
voices
and
apparitions
whereat
the
jury
as
twelve
honest
christians
were
bound
to
do
returned
a
verdict
of
temporary
insanity
and
in
a
week
more
the
grew
tired
and
the
world
too
who
never
expects
anything
not
even
french
revolutions
grew
tired
also
of
repeating
me
who
would
have
expected
it
and
having
filled
up
the
colonel
place
swaggered
on
as
usual
with
the
flesh
and
the
devil
bracebridge
death
had
of
course
a
great
effect
on
lancelot
spirit
not
in
the
way
of
warning
though
such
events
seldom
act
in
that
way
on
the
highest
as
well
as
on
the
lowest
minds
after
all
your
progresses
and
deathbeds
do
no
more
good
than
noble
george
cruikshank
will
because
every
one
knows
that
they
are
the
exception
and
not
the
rule
that
the
atheist
generally
dies
with
a
conscience
as
comfortably
callous
as
a
and
the
rake
when
old
age
stops
his
power
of
sinning
becomes
generally
rather
more
respectable
than
his
neighbours
the
new
testament
deals
very
little
in
appeals
ad
terrorem
and
it
would
be
well
if
some
who
fancy
that
they
follow
it
would
do
the
same
and
by
abstaining
from
making
the
chief
incentive
to
virtue
cease
from
tempting
many
a
poor
fellow
to
enlist
on
the
devil
side
the
only
manly
feeling
he
has
left
personal
courage
but
yet
lancelot
was
affected
and
when
on
the
night
of
the
colonel
funeral
he
opened
at
hazard
argemone
bible
and
his
eyes
fell
on
the
passage
which
tells
how
shall
be
taken
and
another
left
great
honest
tears
of
gratitude
dropped
upon
the
page
and
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
in
bitter
thanked
the
new
found
upper
powers
who
as
he
began
to
hope
were
leading
him
not
in
vain
that
he
had
yet
a
life
before
him
wherein
to
play
the
man
and
now
he
felt
that
the
last
link
was
broken
between
him
and
all
his
late
frivolous
companions
all
had
deserted
him
in
his
ruin
but
this
one
and
he
was
silent
in
the
grave
and
now
from
the
world
and
all
its
toys
and
revelry
he
was
parted
once
and
for
ever
and
he
stood
alone
in
the
desert
like
the
last
arab
of
a
stricken
tribe
looking
over
the
wreck
of
ancient
cities
across
barren
sands
where
far
rivers
gleamed
in
the
distance
that
seemed
to
beckon
him
away
into
other
climes
other
hopes
other
duties
old
things
had
passed
away
when
would
all
things
become
new
not
yet
lancelot
thou
hast
still
one
selfish
hope
one
dream
of
bliss
however
impossible
yet
still
cherished
thou
art
a
changed
man
but
for
whose
sake
for
argemone
is
she
to
be
thy
god
then
art
thou
to
live
for
her
or
for
the
sake
of
one
greater
than
she
all
thine
idols
are
broken
swiftly
the
desert
sands
are
drifting
over
them
and
covering
them
all
but
one
must
that
too
be
taken
from
thee
one
morning
a
letter
was
put
into
lancelot
hands
bearing
the
whitford
postmark
tremblingly
he
tore
it
open
it
contained
a
few
passionate
words
from
honoria
argemone
was
dying
of
typhus
fever
and
entreating
to
see
him
once
again
and
honoria
had
with
some
difficulty
as
she
hinted
obtained
leave
from
her
parents
to
send
for
him
his
last
bank
note
carried
him
down
to
whitford
and
calm
and
determined
as
one
who
feels
that
he
has
nothing
more
to
lose
on
earth
and
whose
torment
must
henceforth
become
his
element
he
entered
the
priory
that
evening
he
hardly
spoke
or
looked
at
a
soul
he
felt
that
he
was
there
on
an
errand
which
none
understood
that
he
was
moving
towards
argemone
through
a
spiritual
world
in
which
he
and
she
were
alone
that
in
his
utter
poverty
and
hopelessness
he
stood
above
all
the
luxury
even
above
all
the
sorrow
around
him
that
she
belonged
to
him
and
to
him
alone
and
the
beggar
followed
the
weeping
honoria
towards
his
lady
chamber
with
the
step
and
bearing
of
a
lord
he
was
wrong
there
were
pride
and
fierceness
enough
in
his
heart
mingled
with
that
sense
of
nothingness
of
rank
money
chance
and
change
yea
death
itself
of
all
but
love
mingled
even
with
that
intense
belief
that
his
sorrows
were
but
his
just
deserts
which
now
possessed
all
his
soul
and
in
after
years
he
knew
that
he
was
wrong
but
so
he
felt
at
the
time
and
even
then
the
strength
was
not
all
of
earth
which
bore
him
manlike
through
that
hour
he
entered
the
room
the
darkness
the
silence
the
cool
scent
of
vinegar
struck
a
shudder
through
him
the
squire
was
sitting
half
idiotic
and
helpless
in
his
his
face
lighted
up
as
lancelot
entered
and
he
tried
to
hold
out
his
palsied
hand
lancelot
did
not
see
him
lavington
moved
proudly
and
primly
back
from
the
bed
with
a
face
that
seemed
to
say
through
its
tears
at
least
am
responsible
for
nothing
that
occurs
from
this
interview
lancelot
did
not
see
her
either
he
walked
straight
up
towards
the
bed
as
if
he
were
treading
on
his
own
ground
his
heart
was
between
his
lips
and
yet
his
whole
soul
felt
as
dry
and
hard
as
some
a
faint
voice
oh
how
faint
how
changed
called
him
from
within
the
closed
curtains
is
there
i
know
it
is
he
lancelot
my
lancelot
silently
still
he
drew
aside
the
curtain
the
light
fell
full
upon
her
face
what
a
sight
her
beautiful
hair
cut
close
a
ghastly
white
handkerchief
round
her
head
those
bright
eyes
sunk
and
lustreless
those
ripe
lips
baked
and
black
and
drawn
her
thin
hand
fingering
uneasily
the
it
was
too
much
for
him
he
shuddered
and
turned
his
face
away
that
love
is
even
to
the
last
slight
as
the
gesture
was
she
saw
it
in
an
instant
are
not
afraid
of
infection
she
said
faintly
was
not
lancelot
laughed
aloud
as
men
will
at
strangest
moments
sprung
towards
her
with
open
arms
and
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
with
sudden
strength
she
rose
upright
and
clasped
him
in
her
arms
more
she
sighed
in
a
whisper
to
herself
more
on
earth
and
the
room
and
the
spectators
and
disease
itself
faded
from
around
them
like
vain
dreams
as
she
nestled
closer
and
closer
to
him
and
gazed
into
his
eyes
and
passed
her
shrunken
hand
over
his
cheeks
and
toyed
with
his
hair
and
seemed
to
drink
in
magnetic
life
from
his
embrace
no
one
spoke
or
stirred
they
felt
that
an
awful
and
blessed
spirit
overshadowed
the
lovers
and
were
hushed
as
if
in
the
sanctuary
of
god
suddenly
again
she
raised
her
head
from
his
bosom
and
in
a
tone
in
which
her
old
queenliness
mingled
strangely
with
the
saddest
tenderness
of
you
go
away
now
i
must
talk
to
my
husband
alone
they
went
leading
out
the
squire
who
cast
puzzled
glances
toward
the
pair
and
murmured
to
himself
that
was
sure
to
get
well
now
smith
was
come
everything
went
right
when
he
was
in
the
way
so
they
were
left
alone
do
not
look
so
very
ugly
my
darling
do
i
not
so
very
ugly
though
they
have
cut
off
all
my
poor
hair
and
i
told
them
so
often
not
but
i
kept
a
lock
for
you
and
feebly
she
drew
from
under
the
pillow
a
long
auburn
tress
and
tried
to
wreathe
it
round
his
neck
but
could
not
and
sunk
back
poor
fellow
he
could
bear
no
more
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
burst
into
a
long
low
weeping
am
very
thirsty
darling
reach
me
no
i
will
drink
no
more
except
from
your
dear
lips
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
breathed
his
whole
soul
upon
her
lips
his
tears
fell
on
her
closed
eyelids
you
must
not
cry
see
how
comfortable
i
am
they
are
all
so
kind
soft
bed
cool
room
fresh
air
sweet
drinks
sweet
scents
oh
so
different
from
that
room
room
my
own
and
i
will
tell
you
sit
down
put
your
arm
under
my
when
i
am
on
your
bosom
i
feel
so
strong
god
let
me
last
to
tell
him
all
it
was
for
that
i
sent
for
him
and
then
in
broken
words
she
told
him
how
she
had
gone
up
to
the
fever
patient
at
ashy
on
the
fatal
night
on
which
lancelot
had
last
seen
her
shuddering
she
hinted
at
the
horrible
filth
and
misery
she
had
seen
at
the
foul
scents
which
had
sickened
her
a
madness
of
remorse
she
said
had
seized
her
she
had
gone
in
spite
of
her
disgust
to
several
houses
which
she
found
open
there
were
worse
cottages
there
than
even
her
father
some
tradesmen
in
a
neighbouring
town
had
been
allowed
to
run
up
a
set
of
rack
rent
another
shudder
seized
her
when
she
spoke
of
them
and
from
that
point
in
her
story
all
was
fitful
broken
like
the
images
of
a
hideous
dream
instant
those
foul
memories
were
defiling
her
nostrils
a
horrible
loathing
had
taken
possession
of
her
recurring
from
time
to
time
till
it
ended
in
delirium
and
fever
a
was
haunting
her
night
and
day
she
said
now
the
curse
of
the
lavingtons
had
truly
come
upon
her
to
perish
by
the
people
whom
they
made
their
neglect
cupidity
oppression
are
avenged
on
me
why
not
have
i
not
wantoned
in
down
and
perfumes
while
they
by
whose
labour
my
luxuries
were
bought
were
pining
among
scents
and
sounds
one
day
of
which
would
have
driven
me
mad
and
then
they
wonder
why
men
turn
chartists
there
are
those
horrible
scents
again
save
me
from
them
lancelot
darling
take
me
to
the
fresh
air
i
choke
i
am
festering
away
the
take
all
the
water
every
drop
and
wash
ashy
clean
again
make
a
great
fountain
in
it
beautiful
marble
to
bubble
and
gurgle
and
trickle
and
foam
for
ever
and
ever
and
wash
away
the
sins
of
the
lavingtons
that
the
little
rosy
children
may
play
round
it
and
the
poor
woman
may
wash
and
wash
and
drink
water
water
i
am
dying
of
thirst
he
gave
her
water
and
then
she
lay
back
and
babbled
about
the
pool
sweeping
the
houses
of
ashy
into
one
beautiful
palace
among
great
where
the
school
children
will
sit
and
sing
such
merry
hymns
and
never
struggle
with
great
pails
of
water
up
the
hill
of
ashy
any
more
will
do
it
darling
strong
wise
that
you
are
why
do
you
look
at
me
you
will
be
rich
some
day
you
will
own
land
for
you
are
worthy
to
own
it
oh
that
i
could
give
you
whitford
no
it
was
mine
too
long
therefore
i
die
because
i
lord
jesus
have
i
not
repented
of
my
sin
then
she
grew
calm
once
more
a
soft
smile
crept
over
her
face
as
it
grew
sharper
and
paler
every
moment
faintly
she
sank
back
on
the
pillows
and
faintly
whispered
to
him
to
kneel
and
pray
he
obeyed
her
not
for
me
for
them
for
them
and
for
yourself
that
you
may
save
them
whom
i
never
dreamt
that
i
was
bound
to
save
and
he
knelt
and
prayed
what
he
alone
and
those
who
heard
his
prayer
can
when
he
lifted
up
his
head
at
last
he
saw
that
argemone
lay
motionless
for
a
moment
he
thought
she
was
dead
and
frantically
sprang
to
the
bell
the
family
rushed
in
with
the
physician
she
gave
some
faint
token
of
life
but
none
of
consciousness
the
doctor
sighed
and
said
that
her
end
was
near
lancelot
had
known
that
all
along
think
sir
you
had
better
leave
the
room
said
lavington
and
followed
him
into
the
passage
what
she
was
about
to
say
remained
unspoken
for
lancelot
seized
her
hand
in
spite
of
her
with
frantic
thanks
for
having
allowed
him
this
one
interview
and
entreaties
that
he
might
see
her
again
if
but
for
one
moment
lavington
somewhat
more
softly
than
usual
said
the
result
of
this
visit
had
not
been
such
as
to
make
a
second
desirable
that
she
had
no
wish
to
disturb
her
daughter
mind
at
such
a
moment
with
earthly
regrets
regrets
how
little
she
knew
what
had
passed
there
but
if
she
had
known
would
she
have
been
one
whit
softened
for
indeed
argemone
spirituality
was
not
in
her
mother
language
and
yet
the
good
woman
had
prayed
and
prayed
and
wept
bitter
tears
by
her
daughter
bedside
day
after
day
but
she
had
never
heard
her
pronounce
the
talismanic
formula
of
words
necessary
in
her
eyes
to
ensure
salvation
and
so
she
was
almost
without
hope
for
her
oh
bigotry
devil
who
turnest
god
love
into
man
curse
are
not
human
hearts
hard
and
blind
enough
of
themselves
without
thy
cursed
help
for
one
moment
a
storm
of
unutterable
pride
and
rage
convulsed
lancelot
the
next
instant
love
conquered
and
the
strong
proud
man
threw
himself
on
his
knees
at
the
feet
of
the
woman
he
despised
and
with
wild
sobs
entreated
for
one
moment
more
one
only
at
that
instant
a
shriek
from
honoria
resounded
from
the
sick
chamber
lancelot
knew
what
it
meant
and
sprang
up
as
men
do
when
shot
through
the
in
a
moment
he
was
himself
again
a
new
life
had
begun
for
him
alone
will
not
need
to
grant
my
prayer
madam
he
said
calmly
is
dead
chapter
xvii
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
let
us
pass
over
the
period
of
dull
stupefied
misery
that
followed
when
lancelot
had
returned
to
his
lonely
lodging
and
the
excitement
of
his
feelings
had
died
away
it
is
impossible
to
describe
that
which
could
not
be
separated
into
parts
in
which
there
was
no
foreground
no
distance
but
only
one
dead
black
colourless
present
after
a
time
however
he
began
to
find
that
fancies
almost
ridiculously
trivial
arrested
and
absorbed
his
attention
even
as
when
our
eyes
have
become
accustomed
to
darkness
every
mote
shows
luminous
against
the
void
blackness
of
night
so
we
are
tempted
to
unseemly
frivolity
in
churches
and
at
funerals
and
all
most
solemn
moments
and
so
lancelot
found
his
imagination
fluttering
back
half
amused
to
every
smallest
circumstance
of
the
last
few
weeks
as
objects
of
mere
curiosity
and
found
with
astonishment
that
they
had
lost
their
power
of
paining
him
just
as
victims
on
the
rack
have
fallen
it
is
said
by
length
of
torture
into
insensibility
and
even
calm
repose
his
brain
had
been
wrought
until
all
feeling
was
benumbed
he
began
to
think
what
an
interesting
autobiography
his
life
might
make
and
the
events
of
the
last
few
years
began
to
arrange
themselves
in
a
most
attractive
dramatic
form
he
began
even
to
work
out
a
scene
or
two
and
where
seemed
wanting
to
invent
them
here
and
there
he
sat
thus
for
hours
silent
over
his
fire
playing
with
his
old
self
as
though
it
were
a
thing
which
did
not
belong
to
him
a
suit
of
clothes
which
he
had
put
off
and
which
that
it
was
too
rich
to
hang
by
the
wall
it
must
be
ripped
and
then
pieced
and
dizened
out
afresh
as
a
toy
and
then
again
he
started
away
from
his
own
thoughts
at
finding
himself
on
the
edge
of
that
very
gulf
which
as
mellot
had
lately
told
him
barnakill
denounced
as
the
true
hell
of
genius
where
art
is
regarded
as
an
end
and
not
a
means
and
objects
are
interesting
not
in
as
far
as
they
form
our
spirits
but
in
proportion
as
they
can
be
shaped
into
effective
parts
of
some
beautiful
whole
but
whether
it
was
a
temptation
or
none
the
desire
recurred
to
him
again
and
again
he
even
attempted
to
write
but
sickened
at
the
sight
of
the
first
words
he
turned
to
his
pencil
and
tried
to
represent
with
it
one
scene
at
least
and
with
the
horrible
calmness
of
some
torturing
ascetic
he
sat
down
to
sketch
a
drawing
of
himself
and
argemone
on
her
dying
day
with
her
head
upon
his
bosom
for
the
last
time
and
then
tossed
it
angrily
into
the
fire
partly
because
he
felt
just
as
he
had
in
his
attempts
to
write
that
there
was
something
more
in
all
these
events
than
he
could
utter
by
pen
or
pencil
than
he
could
even
understand
principally
because
he
could
not
arrange
the
attitudes
gracefully
enough
and
now
in
front
of
the
stern
realities
of
sorrow
and
death
he
began
to
see
a
meaning
in
another
mysterious
saying
of
barnakill
which
mellot
was
continually
quoting
that
was
never
art
till
it
was
more
than
art
that
the
finite
only
existed
as
a
body
of
the
infinite
and
that
the
man
of
genius
must
first
know
the
infinite
unless
he
wished
to
become
not
a
poet
but
a
maker
of
idols
still
he
felt
in
himself
a
capability
nay
an
infinite
longing
to
speak
though
what
he
should
utter
or
how
whether
as
poet
social
theorist
preacher
he
could
not
yet
decide
barnakill
had
forbidden
him
painting
and
though
he
hardly
knew
why
he
dared
not
disobey
him
but
argemone
dying
words
lay
on
him
as
a
divine
command
to
labour
all
his
doubts
his
social
observations
his
dreams
of
the
beautiful
and
the
blissful
his
intense
perception
of
social
evils
his
born
hope
faith
it
could
not
yet
be
called
in
a
ruler
and
deliverer
of
the
world
all
urged
him
on
to
labour
but
at
what
he
felt
as
if
he
were
the
demon
in
the
legend
condemned
to
twine
endless
ropes
of
sand
the
world
outside
which
he
now
stood
for
good
and
evil
seemed
to
him
like
some
frantic
whirling
waltz
some
serried
struggling
crowd
which
rushed
past
him
in
aimless
confusion
without
allowing
him
time
or
opening
to
take
his
place
among
their
ranks
and
as
for
wings
to
rise
above
and
to
look
down
upon
the
uproar
where
were
they
his
melancholy
paralysed
him
more
and
more
he
was
too
listless
even
to
cater
for
his
daily
bread
by
writing
his
articles
for
the
magazines
why
should
he
he
had
nothing
to
say
why
should
he
pour
out
words
and
empty
sound
and
add
one
more
futility
to
the
herd
of
that
had
become
wind
and
had
no
truth
in
them
those
who
could
write
without
a
conscience
without
an
object
except
that
of
seeing
their
own
fine
words
and
filling
their
own
pockets
let
them
do
it
for
his
part
he
would
have
none
of
it
but
his
purse
was
empty
and
so
was
his
stomach
and
as
for
asking
assistance
of
his
uncle
it
was
returning
like
the
dog
to
his
vomit
so
one
day
he
settled
all
bills
with
his
last
shilling
tied
up
his
remaining
clothes
in
a
bundle
and
stoutly
stepped
forth
into
the
street
to
find
a
job
to
hold
a
horse
if
nothing
better
offered
when
behold
on
the
threshold
he
met
barnakill
himself
away
said
that
strange
personage
was
just
going
to
call
on
you
earn
my
bread
by
the
labour
of
my
hands
so
our
fathers
all
began
so
their
sons
must
all
end
do
you
want
work
if
you
have
any
me
and
carry
a
trunk
home
from
a
shop
to
my
lodgings
he
strode
off
with
lancelot
after
him
entered
a
mathematical
instrument
maker
shop
in
the
neighbouring
street
and
pointed
out
a
heavy
corded
case
to
lancelot
who
with
the
assistance
of
the
shopman
got
it
on
his
shoulders
and
trudging
forth
through
the
streets
after
his
employer
who
walked
before
him
silent
and
unregarding
felt
himself
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
in
the
same
situation
as
nine
hundred
and
out
of
every
thousand
of
adam
descendants
and
discovered
somewhat
to
his
satisfaction
that
when
he
could
once
rid
his
mind
of
its
old
superstition
that
every
one
was
looking
at
him
it
mattered
very
little
whether
the
burden
carried
were
a
deal
trunk
or
a
downing
street
his
employer
lodgings
were
in
paul
churchyard
lancelot
set
the
trunk
down
inside
the
door
do
you
charge
barnakill
looked
him
steadily
in
the
face
gave
him
the
sixpence
went
in
and
shut
the
door
lancelot
wandered
down
the
street
half
amused
at
the
simple
test
which
had
just
been
applied
to
him
and
yet
sickened
with
disappointment
for
he
had
cherished
a
mysterious
fancy
that
with
this
strange
being
all
his
hopes
of
future
activity
were
bound
up
tregarva
month
was
nearly
over
and
yet
no
tidings
of
him
had
come
mellot
had
left
london
on
some
mysterious
errand
of
the
prophet
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
seemed
to
stand
utterly
alone
he
was
at
one
pole
and
the
whole
universe
at
the
other
it
was
in
vain
to
tell
himself
that
his
own
act
had
placed
him
there
that
he
had
friends
to
whom
he
might
appeal
he
would
not
he
dare
not
accept
outward
help
even
outward
friendship
however
hearty
and
sincere
at
that
crisis
of
his
existence
it
seemed
a
desecration
of
its
awfulness
to
find
comfort
in
anything
but
the
highest
and
the
deepest
and
the
glimpse
of
that
which
he
had
attained
seemed
to
have
passed
away
from
him
again
seemed
to
be
something
which
as
it
had
arisen
with
argemone
was
lost
with
her
also
one
speck
of
the
far
blue
sky
which
the
rolling
clouds
had
covered
in
again
as
he
passed
under
the
shadow
of
the
huge
cathedral
and
looked
at
its
grim
spiked
railings
and
closed
doors
it
seemed
to
him
a
symbol
of
the
spiritual
world
clouded
and
barred
from
him
he
stopped
and
looked
up
and
tried
to
think
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
lighted
up
in
clear
radiance
the
huge
cross
on
the
summit
was
it
an
omen
lancelot
thought
so
but
at
that
instant
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
round
it
was
that
strange
man
again
far
well
said
he
are
making
a
better
day
work
than
you
fancy
and
earning
more
wages
for
instance
here
is
a
packet
for
you
lancelot
seized
it
trembling
and
tore
it
open
it
was
directed
in
honoria
handwriting
had
you
this
said
he
mellot
through
whom
i
can
return
your
answer
if
one
be
needed
the
letter
was
significant
of
honoria
character
it
busied
itself
entirely
about
facts
and
showed
the
depth
of
her
sorrow
by
making
no
allusion
to
it
as
lancelot
was
probably
aware
had
bequeathed
to
him
the
whole
of
her
own
fortune
at
lavington
death
and
had
directed
that
various
precious
things
of
hers
should
be
delivered
over
to
him
immediately
her
mother
however
kept
her
chamber
under
lock
and
key
and
refused
to
allow
an
article
to
be
removed
from
its
accustomed
place
it
was
natural
in
the
first
burst
of
her
sorrow
and
lancelot
would
pardon
all
his
drawings
and
letters
had
been
by
argemone
desire
placed
with
her
in
her
coffin
honoria
had
been
only
able
to
obey
her
in
sending
a
favourite
ring
of
hers
and
with
it
the
last
stanzas
which
she
had
composed
before
her
death
stars
aloft
in
ether
clear
around
each
other
roll
away
within
one
common
atmosphere
of
their
own
mutual
light
and
day
myriad
happy
eyes
are
bent
upon
their
changeless
love
alway
as
strengthened
by
their
one
intent
they
pour
the
flood
of
life
and
day
we
through
this
world
waning
night
shall
hand
in
hand
pursue
our
way
shed
round
us
order
love
and
light
and
shine
unto
the
perfect
day
the
precious
relic
with
all
its
shattered
hopes
came
at
the
right
moment
to
soften
his
heart
the
sight
the
touch
of
it
shot
like
an
electric
spark
through
the
black
stifling
of
his
soul
and
dissolved
it
in
refreshing
showers
of
tears
barnakill
led
him
gently
within
the
area
of
the
railings
where
he
might
conceal
his
emotion
and
it
was
but
a
few
seconds
before
lancelot
had
recovered
his
and
followed
him
up
the
steps
through
the
wicket
door
they
entered
the
afternoon
service
was
proceeding
the
organ
droned
sadly
in
its
iron
cage
to
a
few
musical
amateurs
some
nursery
maids
and
foreign
sailors
stared
about
within
the
spiked
felon
dock
which
shut
off
the
body
of
the
cathedral
and
tried
in
vain
to
hear
what
was
going
on
inside
the
choir
as
a
wise
author
a
protestant
too
has
lately
said
scanty
service
rattled
in
the
vast
building
like
a
dried
kernel
too
small
for
its
shell
the
place
breathed
imbecility
and
unreality
and
sleepy
death
while
the
whole
nineteenth
century
went
roaring
on
its
way
outside
and
as
lancelot
thought
though
only
as
a
dilettante
of
old
paul
the
morning
star
and
focal
beacon
of
england
through
centuries
and
dynasties
from
old
augustine
and
mellitus
up
to
those
paul
cross
sermons
whose
thunders
shook
thrones
and
to
noble
wren
masterpiece
of
art
he
asked
all
this
coleridge
dictum
that
a
cathedral
is
a
petrified
religion
may
be
taken
to
bear
more
meanings
than
one
when
will
life
return
to
this
cathedral
system
was
it
ever
a
living
system
answered
the
other
was
it
ever
anything
but
a
transitionary
makeshift
since
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
then
not
away
with
it
at
once
english
have
not
done
with
it
yet
at
all
events
it
is
keeping
your
cathedrals
for
you
till
you
can
put
them
to
some
better
use
than
now
in
the
meantime
the
meantime
there
is
life
enough
in
them
life
that
will
wake
the
dead
some
day
do
you
hear
what
those
choristers
are
chanting
now
i
said
lancelot
any
one
round
us
i
should
think
is
our
own
fault
after
all
for
we
were
not
good
churchmen
enough
to
come
in
time
for
vespers
you
a
churchman
then
thank
god
there
may
be
other
churches
than
those
of
europe
or
syria
and
right
catholic
ones
too
but
shall
i
tell
you
what
they
are
singing
he
hath
put
down
the
mighty
from
their
seat
and
hath
exalted
the
humble
and
meek
he
hath
filled
the
hungry
with
good
things
and
the
rich
he
hath
sent
empty
away
is
there
no
life
think
you
in
those
words
spoken
here
every
afternoon
in
the
name
of
god
hirelings
who
neither
care
nor
understand
be
not
hasty
with
imputations
of
evil
within
walls
dedicated
to
and
preserved
by
the
even
should
the
speakers
forget
the
meaning
of
their
own
words
to
my
sense
perhaps
that
may
just
now
leave
the
words
more
entirely
god
at
all
events
confess
that
whatever
accidental
husks
may
have
clustered
round
it
here
is
a
germ
of
eternal
truth
no
i
dare
not
despair
of
you
english
as
long
as
i
hear
your
priesthood
forced
by
providence
even
in
spite
of
themselves
thus
to
speak
god
words
about
an
age
in
which
the
condition
of
the
poor
and
the
rights
and
duties
of
man
are
becoming
the
for
all
thought
and
all
organisation
does
it
not
make
the
case
more
hopeless
that
such
words
have
been
spoken
for
centuries
and
no
man
regards
them
have
to
blame
for
that
the
people
rather
than
the
priest
as
they
are
so
will
he
be
in
every
age
and
country
he
is
but
the
index
which
the
changes
of
their
spiritual
state
move
up
and
down
the
scale
and
as
they
will
become
in
england
in
the
next
half
century
so
will
he
become
also
can
these
dry
bones
live
asked
lancelot
scornfully
are
you
to
ask
what
were
you
three
months
ago
for
i
know
well
your
story
but
do
you
remember
what
the
prophet
saw
in
the
valley
of
vision
how
first
that
those
same
dry
bones
shook
and
clashed
together
as
if
uneasy
because
they
were
disorganised
and
how
they
then
found
flesh
and
stood
upright
and
yet
there
was
no
life
in
them
till
at
last
the
spirit
came
down
and
entered
into
them
surely
there
is
shaking
enough
among
the
bones
now
it
is
happening
to
the
body
of
your
england
as
it
did
to
adam
after
he
was
made
it
lay
on
earth
the
rabbis
say
forty
days
before
the
breath
of
life
was
put
into
it
and
the
devil
came
and
kicked
it
and
it
sounded
hollow
as
england
is
doing
now
but
that
did
not
prevent
the
breath
of
life
coming
in
good
time
nor
will
it
in
england
case
lancelot
looked
at
him
with
a
puzzled
face
must
not
speak
in
such
deep
parables
to
so
young
a
learner
my
parable
so
hard
then
look
around
you
and
see
what
is
the
characteristic
of
your
country
and
of
your
generation
at
this
moment
what
a
yearning
what
an
expectation
amid
infinite
falsehoods
and
confusions
of
some
nobler
more
chivalrous
more
godlike
state
your
very
costermonger
trolls
out
his
belief
that
there
a
good
time
coming
and
the
hearts
of
gamins
as
well
as
millenarians
answer
true
is
not
that
a
clashing
among
the
dry
bones
and
as
for
flesh
what
new
materials
are
springing
up
among
you
every
month
spiritual
and
physical
for
a
state
such
as
eye
hath
not
seen
nor
ear
heard
railroads
electric
telegraphs
sanitary
reforms
experimental
schools
chemical
agriculture
a
matchless
school
of
inductive
science
an
equally
matchless
school
of
naturalist
painters
and
all
this
in
the
very
workshop
of
the
world
look
again
at
the
healthy
craving
after
religious
art
and
ceremonial
the
strong
desire
to
preserve
that
which
has
stood
the
test
of
time
and
on
the
other
hand
at
the
manful
resolution
of
your
middle
classes
to
stand
or
fall
by
the
bible
alone
to
admit
no
innovations
in
worship
which
are
empty
of
instinctive
meaning
look
at
the
enormous
amount
of
practical
benevolence
which
now
struggles
in
vain
against
evil
only
because
it
is
as
yet
private
desultory
divided
how
dare
you
young
man
despair
of
your
own
nation
while
its
nobles
can
produce
a
carlisle
an
ellesmere
an
ashley
a
robert
grosvenor
while
its
middle
classes
can
beget
a
faraday
a
stephenson
a
brooke
an
elizabeth
fry
see
i
say
what
a
chaos
of
noble
materials
is
here
all
confused
it
is
true
polarised
jarring
and
chaotic
here
bigotry
there
superstition
sheer
atheism
often
but
only
waiting
for
the
one
inspiring
spirit
to
organise
and
unite
and
consecrate
this
chaos
into
the
noblest
polity
the
world
ever
saw
realised
what
a
destiny
may
be
that
of
your
land
if
you
have
but
the
faith
to
see
your
own
honour
were
i
not
of
my
own
country
i
would
be
an
englishman
this
day
what
is
your
country
asked
lancelot
should
be
a
noble
one
which
breeds
such
men
as
you
the
stranger
smiled
you
go
thither
with
me
not
i
long
for
travel
and
truly
i
am
sick
of
my
own
country
when
the
spirit
of
which
you
speak
he
went
on
bitterly
descend
i
may
return
till
then
england
is
no
place
for
the
penniless
know
you
that
the
spirit
is
not
even
now
poured
out
must
your
english
pharisees
and
sadducees
too
have
signs
and
wonders
ere
they
believe
will
man
never
know
that
the
kingdom
of
god
comes
not
by
observation
that
now
as
ever
his
promise
stands
true
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
how
many
inspired
hearts
even
now
may
be
cherishing
in
secret
the
idea
which
shall
reform
the
age
and
fulfil
at
once
the
longings
of
every
sect
and
rank
it
to
me
then
can
name
it
who
can
even
see
it
but
those
who
are
like
him
from
whom
it
comes
them
a
long
and
stern
discipline
awaits
would
you
be
of
them
you
must
like
the
highest
who
ever
trod
this
earth
go
fasting
into
the
wilderness
and
among
the
wild
beasts
stand
alone
face
to
face
with
the
powers
of
nature
will
go
where
you
shall
bid
me
i
will
turn
shepherd
among
the
scottish
mountains
live
as
an
anchorite
in
the
solitudes
of
dartmoor
but
to
what
purpose
i
have
listened
long
to
nature
voice
but
even
the
whispers
of
a
spiritual
presence
which
haunted
my
childhood
have
died
away
and
i
hear
nothing
in
her
but
the
grinding
of
the
iron
wheels
of
mechanical
necessity
is
the
will
of
god
henceforth
you
shall
study
not
nature
but
him
yet
as
for
place
i
do
not
like
your
english
primitive
formations
where
earth
worn
out
with
struggling
has
fallen
wearily
asleep
no
you
shall
rather
come
to
asia
the
oldest
and
yet
the
youngest
continent
to
our
volcanic
mountain
ranges
where
her
bosom
still
heaves
with
the
creative
energy
of
youth
around
the
primeval
cradle
of
the
most
ancient
race
of
men
then
when
you
have
learnt
the
wondrous
harmony
between
man
and
his
i
will
lead
you
to
a
land
where
you
shall
see
the
highest
spiritual
cultivation
in
triumphant
contact
with
the
fiercest
energies
of
matter
where
men
have
learnt
to
tame
and
use
alike
the
volcano
and
the
human
heart
where
the
body
and
the
spirit
the
beautiful
and
the
useful
the
human
and
the
divine
are
no
longer
separate
and
men
have
embodied
to
themselves
on
earth
an
image
of
the
city
not
made
with
hands
eternal
in
the
heavens
is
this
land
said
lancelot
eagerly
human
nature
must
have
its
name
for
everything
you
have
heard
of
the
country
of
prester
john
that
mysterious
christian
empire
rarely
visited
by
european
eye
are
legends
of
two
such
said
lancelot
ethiopian
and
an
asiatic
one
and
the
ethiopian
if
we
are
to
believe
colonel
harris
journey
to
shoa
is
a
sufficiently
miserable
failure
the
day
of
the
chamitic
race
is
past
you
will
not
say
the
same
of
our
caucasian
empire
to
our
race
the
present
belongs
to
england
france
germany
america
to
us
will
you
see
what
we
have
done
and
perhaps
bring
home
after
long
wanderings
a
message
for
your
country
which
may
help
to
unravel
the
tangled
web
of
this
strange
time
will
said
lancelot
this
moment
and
yet
no
there
is
one
with
whom
i
have
promised
to
share
all
future
weal
and
woe
without
him
i
can
take
no
step
he
what
made
you
guess
that
i
spoke
of
him
told
me
of
him
and
of
you
too
six
weeks
ago
he
is
now
gone
to
fetch
him
from
manchester
i
can
not
trust
him
here
in
england
yet
the
country
made
him
sad
london
has
made
him
mad
manchester
may
make
him
bad
it
is
too
fearful
a
trial
even
for
his
faith
i
must
take
him
with
us
interest
in
him
not
to
say
what
authority
over
him
have
you
same
which
i
have
over
you
you
will
come
with
me
so
will
he
it
is
my
business
as
my
name
signifies
to
save
the
children
alive
whom
european
society
leaves
carelessly
and
ignorantly
to
die
and
as
for
my
power
i
come
said
he
with
a
smile
a
country
which
sends
no
one
on
its
errands
without
first
thoroughly
satisfying
itself
as
to
his
power
of
fulfilling
them
he
goes
i
go
with
you
he
will
go
and
yet
think
what
you
do
it
is
a
fearful
journey
they
who
travel
it
even
as
they
came
naked
out
of
their
mother
womb
even
as
they
return
thither
and
carry
nothing
with
them
of
all
which
they
have
gotten
in
this
life
so
must
those
who
travel
to
my
land
tregarva
is
he
too
to
give
up
all
i
had
thought
that
i
saw
in
him
a
precious
possession
one
for
which
i
would
barter
all
my
scholarship
my
talents
ay
my
life
itself
possession
worth
your
life
what
then
in
an
unseen
god
him
whether
he
would
call
that
a
possession
his
own
in
any
sense
would
call
it
a
revelation
to
him
is
a
taking
of
the
veil
from
something
which
was
behind
the
veil
already
which
may
therefore
just
as
really
be
behind
the
veil
in
other
cases
without
its
presence
being
suspected
what
sense
now
is
that
a
possession
do
you
possess
the
sun
because
you
see
it
did
herschel
create
uranus
by
discovering
it
or
even
increase
by
an
atom
its
attraction
on
one
particle
of
his
own
body
is
all
this
tending
tregarva
does
not
possess
his
father
and
his
lord
he
is
possessed
by
them
he
would
say
and
i
should
believe
him
that
he
has
seen
and
known
them
not
with
his
bodily
eyes
but
with
his
soul
heart
imagination
call
it
what
you
will
all
i
know
is
that
between
him
and
me
there
is
a
great
gulf
fixed
seen
and
known
them
utterly
comprehended
them
are
they
not
infinite
incomprehensible
can
the
less
comprehend
the
greater
knows
at
least
enough
of
them
to
make
him
what
i
am
not
is
he
knows
something
of
them
and
may
not
you
know
something
of
them
also
enough
to
make
you
what
he
is
not
lancelot
shook
his
head
in
silence
that
you
had
met
and
spoken
with
your
father
and
loved
him
when
you
saw
him
and
yet
were
not
aware
of
the
relation
in
which
you
stood
to
him
still
you
would
know
him
the
most
important
thing
of
all
that
he
was
my
father
that
the
most
important
thing
is
it
not
more
important
that
he
should
know
that
you
were
his
son
that
he
should
support
guide
educate
you
even
though
unseen
do
you
not
know
that
some
one
has
been
doing
that
i
have
been
supported
guided
educated
i
know
full
well
but
by
whom
i
know
not
and
i
know
too
that
i
have
been
punished
and
therefore
therefore
i
can
not
free
the
thought
of
a
him
of
a
person
only
of
a
destiny
of
laws
and
powers
which
have
no
faces
wherewith
to
frown
awful
wrath
upon
me
if
it
be
a
person
who
has
been
leading
me
i
must
go
mad
or
know
that
he
has
forgiven
conceive
that
it
is
he
and
not
punishment
which
you
fear
lancelot
was
silent
a
he
and
not
hell
at
all
is
what
i
fear
he
can
inflict
no
punishment
on
me
worse
than
the
inner
hell
which
i
have
felt
already
many
and
many
a
time
verba
that
is
an
awful
thing
to
say
but
better
this
extreme
than
the
and
you
would
what
pardoned
he
loves
you
he
has
pardoned
you
already
do
i
know
that
he
loves
me
does
tregarva
is
a
righteous
man
and
i
a
sinner
he
would
and
rightly
call
himself
the
same
he
knows
that
god
loves
him
that
he
is
god
child
then
god
did
not
love
him
till
he
caused
god
to
love
him
by
knowing
that
he
loved
him
he
was
not
god
child
till
he
made
himself
one
by
believing
that
he
was
one
when
as
yet
he
was
not
i
appeal
to
common
sense
and
logic
it
was
revealed
to
tregarva
that
god
had
been
loving
him
while
he
was
yet
a
bad
man
if
he
loved
him
in
spite
of
his
sin
why
should
he
not
have
loved
you
he
had
loved
me
would
he
have
left
me
in
ignorance
of
himself
for
if
he
be
to
know
him
is
the
highest
good
he
left
tregarva
in
ignorance
of
himself
certainly
tregarva
spoke
of
his
conversion
as
of
a
turning
to
one
of
whom
he
had
known
all
along
and
disregarded
do
you
turn
like
him
to
him
whom
you
have
known
all
along
and
disregarded
you
if
half
i
have
heard
and
seen
of
you
be
true
he
has
been
telling
you
more
and
not
less
of
himself
than
he
does
to
most
men
you
for
aught
i
know
may
know
more
of
him
than
tregarva
does
the
gulf
between
you
and
him
is
this
he
has
obeyed
what
he
knew
and
you
have
lancelot
paused
a
moment
then
do
not
cheat
me
you
said
once
that
you
were
a
churchman
i
am
a
catholic
of
the
catholics
what
then
is
he
to
whom
you
ask
me
to
turn
you
talk
to
me
of
him
as
my
father
but
you
talk
of
him
to
men
of
your
own
creed
as
the
father
you
have
mysterious
dogmas
of
a
three
in
one
i
know
them
i
have
admired
them
in
all
their
forms
in
the
vedas
in
the
platonists
in
jacob
boehmen
in
your
catholic
creeds
in
coleridge
and
the
germans
from
whom
he
borrowed
i
have
looked
at
them
and
found
in
them
beautiful
phantasms
of
philosophy
all
but
scientific
necessities
but
what
do
not
want
cold
abstract
necessities
of
logic
i
want
living
practical
facts
if
those
mysterious
dogmas
speak
of
real
and
necessary
properties
of
his
being
they
must
be
necessarily
interwoven
in
practice
with
his
revelation
of
himself
true
but
how
would
you
have
him
unveil
himself
unveiling
himself
to
your
simple
intuition
that
was
semele
you
recollect
the
end
of
that
myth
you
recollect
too
as
you
have
read
the
the
result
of
their
similar
attempt
and
magic
and
yet
such
is
the
ambition
of
man
you
who
were
just
now
envying
tregarva
are
already
longing
to
climb
even
higher
than
saint
theresa
do
not
often
indulge
in
such
an
ambition
but
i
have
read
in
your
schoolmen
tales
of
a
beatific
vision
how
that
the
highest
good
for
man
was
to
see
god
did
you
believe
that
can
not
believe
the
impossible
only
regret
its
impossibility
you
can
only
see
the
uncreate
in
the
create
the
infinite
in
the
finite
the
absolute
good
in
that
which
is
like
the
good
does
tregarva
pretend
to
more
he
sees
god
in
his
own
thoughts
and
consciousnesses
and
in
the
events
of
the
world
around
him
imaged
in
the
mirror
of
his
own
mind
is
your
mirror
then
so
much
narrower
than
his
have
none
i
see
but
myself
and
the
world
and
far
above
them
a
dim
awful
unity
which
is
but
a
notion
and
slow
of
heart
to
believe
where
else
would
you
see
him
but
in
yourself
and
in
the
world
they
are
all
things
cognisable
to
you
where
else
but
everywhere
would
you
see
him
whom
no
man
hath
seen
or
can
see
he
shows
himself
to
me
in
them
then
i
may
see
him
but
now
have
seen
him
and
because
you
do
not
know
the
name
of
what
you
see
or
rather
will
not
acknowledge
it
you
fancy
that
it
is
not
there
in
his
name
what
have
i
seen
yourself
have
you
not
seen
in
your
fancy
at
least
an
ideal
of
man
for
which
you
spurned
for
mellot
has
told
me
all
the
merely
negative
angelic
the
merely
receptive
and
indulgent
of
humanity
and
longed
to
be
a
man
like
that
ideal
and
perfect
man
have
what
was
your
misery
all
along
was
it
not
that
you
felt
you
ought
to
be
a
person
with
a
one
inner
unity
a
one
practical
will
purpose
and
business
given
to
you
not
invented
by
yourself
in
the
great
order
and
harmony
of
the
universe
and
that
you
were
not
one
that
your
fancies
and
passions
had
torn
you
in
pieces
and
left
you
inconsistent
dismembered
helpless
purposeless
that
in
short
you
were
below
your
ideal
just
in
proportion
as
you
were
not
a
person
knows
you
speak
truth
must
not
that
ideal
of
humanity
be
a
person
himself
else
how
can
he
be
the
ideal
man
where
is
your
logic
an
impersonal
ideal
of
a
personal
species
and
what
is
the
most
special
peculiarity
of
man
is
it
not
that
he
alone
of
creation
is
a
son
with
a
father
to
love
and
to
obey
then
must
not
the
ideal
man
be
a
son
also
and
last
but
not
least
is
it
not
the
very
property
of
man
that
he
is
a
spirit
invested
with
flesh
and
blood
then
must
not
the
ideal
man
have
once
at
least
taken
on
himself
flesh
and
blood
also
else
how
could
he
fulfil
his
own
idea
yes
that
thought
too
has
glanced
through
my
mind
at
moments
like
a
till
i
have
envied
the
old
greeks
their
faith
in
a
human
zeus
son
of
kronos
a
human
phoibos
son
of
zeus
but
i
could
not
rest
in
them
they
are
noble
but
are
they
are
any
perfect
ideals
the
one
thing
i
did
and
do
and
will
believe
is
the
one
which
they
do
not
fulfil
that
man
is
meant
to
be
the
conqueror
of
the
earth
matter
nature
decay
death
itself
and
to
conquer
them
as
bacon
says
by
obeying
them
it
fast
but
follow
it
out
and
say
boldly
the
ideal
of
humanity
must
be
one
who
has
conquered
nature
one
who
rules
the
universe
one
who
has
vanquished
death
itself
and
conquered
them
as
bacon
says
not
by
violating
but
by
submitting
to
them
have
you
never
heard
of
one
who
is
said
to
have
done
this
how
do
you
know
that
in
this
ideal
which
you
have
seen
you
have
not
seen
the
son
the
perfect
man
who
died
and
rose
again
and
sits
for
ever
healer
and
lord
and
ruler
of
the
universe
stay
do
not
answer
me
have
you
not
besides
had
dreams
of
an
from
whom
in
some
mysterious
way
all
things
and
beings
must
derive
their
source
and
that
son
if
my
theory
be
true
among
the
rest
and
above
all
the
rest
has
not
but
what
more
dim
or
distant
more
drearily
hopelessly
notional
than
that
thought
the
thought
that
there
is
none
but
the
dreariness
was
only
in
your
own
inconsistency
if
he
be
the
father
of
all
he
must
be
the
father
of
persons
he
himself
therefore
a
person
he
must
be
the
father
of
all
in
whom
dwell
personal
qualities
power
wisdom
creative
energy
love
justice
pity
can
he
be
their
father
unless
all
these
very
qualities
are
infinitely
his
does
he
now
look
so
terrible
to
you
have
had
this
dream
too
but
i
turned
away
from
it
in
dread
you
did
some
day
you
will
know
why
does
that
former
dream
of
a
human
son
relieve
this
dream
of
none
of
its
awfulness
may
not
the
type
be
beloved
for
the
sake
of
its
antitype
even
if
the
very
name
of
is
no
guarantee
for
his
paternal
pity
but
you
have
had
this
dream
how
know
you
that
in
it
you
were
not
allowed
a
glimpse
however
dim
and
distant
of
him
whom
the
catholics
call
the
father
may
be
but
again
had
you
never
the
sense
of
a
spirit
in
you
a
will
an
energy
an
inspiration
deeper
than
the
region
of
consciousness
and
reflection
which
like
the
wind
blew
where
it
listed
and
you
heard
the
sound
of
it
ringing
through
your
whole
consciousness
and
yet
knew
not
whence
it
came
or
whither
it
went
or
why
it
drove
you
on
to
dare
and
suffer
to
love
and
hate
to
be
a
fighter
a
sportsman
an
artist
a
drunkard
added
lancelot
sadly
a
drunkard
but
did
it
never
seem
to
you
that
this
strange
wayward
spirit
if
anything
was
the
very
root
and
core
of
your
own
personality
and
had
you
never
a
craving
for
the
help
of
some
higher
mightier
spirit
to
guide
and
strengthen
yours
to
regulate
and
civilise
its
savage
and
spasmodic
to
teach
you
your
rightful
place
in
the
great
order
of
the
universe
around
to
fill
you
with
a
continuous
purpose
and
with
a
continuous
will
to
do
it
have
you
never
had
a
dream
of
an
inspirer
a
spirit
of
all
spirits
lancelot
turned
away
with
a
shudder
of
anything
but
that
little
you
know
and
yet
you
seem
to
know
everything
the
agony
of
craving
with
which
i
have
longed
for
guidance
the
rage
and
disgust
which
possessed
me
when
i
tried
one
pretended
teacher
after
another
and
found
in
myself
depths
which
their
spirits
could
not
or
rather
would
not
touch
i
have
been
irreverent
to
the
false
from
very
longing
to
worship
the
true
i
have
been
a
rebel
to
sham
leaders
for
very
desire
to
be
loyal
to
a
real
one
i
have
envied
my
poor
cousin
his
jesuits
i
have
envied
my
own
pointers
their
slavery
to
my
whip
and
whistle
i
have
fled
as
a
last
resource
to
brandy
and
opium
for
the
inspiration
which
neither
man
nor
demon
would
then
i
found
you
know
my
and
when
i
looked
to
her
to
guide
and
inspire
me
behold
i
found
myself
by
the
very
laws
of
humanity
compelled
to
guide
and
inspire
her
blind
to
lead
the
blind
thank
god
for
her
sake
that
she
was
taken
from
me
you
ever
mistake
these
substitutes
even
the
noblest
of
them
for
the
reality
did
not
your
very
dissatisfaction
with
them
show
you
that
the
true
inspirer
ought
to
be
if
he
were
to
satisfy
your
cravings
a
person
truly
else
how
could
he
inspire
and
teach
you
a
person
yourself
but
an
utterly
infinite
omniscient
eternal
person
how
know
you
that
in
that
dream
he
was
not
unveiling
himself
to
you
he
the
spirit
who
is
the
lord
and
giver
of
life
the
spirit
who
teaches
men
their
duty
and
relation
to
those
above
around
beneath
them
the
spirit
of
order
obedience
loyalty
brotherhood
mercy
condescension
i
never
could
distinguish
these
dreams
from
each
other
the
moment
that
i
essayed
to
separate
them
i
seemed
to
break
up
the
thought
of
an
absolute
one
ground
of
all
things
without
which
the
universe
would
have
seemed
a
piecemeal
chaos
and
they
receded
to
infinite
distance
and
became
transparent
barren
notional
shadows
of
my
own
brain
even
as
your
words
are
now
know
you
that
you
were
meant
to
distinguish
them
how
know
you
that
that
very
impossibility
was
not
the
testimony
of
fact
and
experience
to
that
old
catholic
dogma
for
the
sake
of
which
you
just
now
shrank
from
my
teaching
i
say
that
this
is
so
how
do
you
know
that
it
is
not
how
do
i
know
that
it
is
i
want
proof
you
are
the
man
who
was
five
minutes
ago
crying
out
for
practical
facts
and
disdaining
cold
abstract
necessities
of
logic
can
you
prove
that
your
body
exists
you
prove
that
your
spirit
exists
yet
know
that
they
both
exist
and
how
ambulando
when
you
try
to
prove
either
of
them
without
the
other
you
fail
you
arrive
if
at
anything
at
some
barren
polar
notion
by
action
alone
you
prove
the
mesothetic
fact
which
underlies
and
unites
them
haec
i
am
not
going
to
demonstrate
the
indemonstrable
to
give
you
intellectual
notions
which
after
all
will
be
but
reflexes
of
my
own
peculiar
brain
and
so
add
the
green
of
my
spectacles
to
the
orange
of
yours
and
make
night
hideous
by
fresh
monsters
i
may
help
you
to
think
yourself
into
a
theoretical
tritheism
or
a
theoretical
sabellianism
i
can
not
make
you
think
yourself
into
practical
and
living
catholicism
as
you
of
anthropology
so
i
say
of
theology
solvitur
ambulando
do
believe
catholic
doctrine
unless
you
like
faith
is
free
but
see
if
you
can
reclaim
either
society
or
yourself
without
it
see
if
he
will
let
you
reclaim
them
take
catholic
doctrine
for
granted
act
on
it
and
see
if
you
will
not
reclaim
them
for
granted
am
i
to
come
after
all
to
implicit
faith
fiddlesticks
did
you
ever
read
the
novum
organum
mellot
told
me
that
you
were
a
geologist
took
for
granted
what
you
read
in
geological
books
and
went
to
the
mine
and
the
quarry
afterwards
to
verify
it
in
practice
and
according
as
you
found
fact
correspond
to
theory
you
retained
or
rejected
was
that
implicit
faith
or
common
sense
common
humility
and
sound
induction
induction
at
least
go
now
and
do
likewise
believe
that
the
learned
wise
and
good
for
years
may
possibly
have
found
out
somewhat
or
have
been
taught
somewhat
on
this
matter
and
test
their
theory
by
practice
if
a
theory
on
such
a
point
is
worth
anything
at
all
it
is
omnipotent
and
if
it
will
not
work
of
course
there
is
no
use
keeping
it
a
moment
perhaps
it
will
work
i
say
it
will
i
shall
not
work
it
i
still
dread
my
own
spectacles
i
dare
not
trust
myself
alone
to
verify
a
theory
of
murchison
or
lyell
how
dare
i
trust
myself
in
this
do
not
trust
yourself
alone
come
and
see
what
others
are
doing
come
and
become
a
member
of
a
body
which
is
verifying
by
united
action
those
universal
and
eternal
truths
which
are
too
great
for
the
grasp
of
any
one
individual
not
that
we
claim
the
gift
of
infallibility
any
more
than
i
do
that
of
perfect
utterance
of
the
little
which
we
do
know
what
do
you
promise
me
in
asking
me
to
go
with
you
proof
that
these
my
words
are
true
practical
proof
that
they
can
make
a
nation
all
that
england
might
be
and
is
not
the
sight
of
what
a
people
might
become
who
knowing
thus
far
do
what
they
know
we
believe
no
more
than
you
but
we
believe
it
come
and
see
and
yet
you
will
not
see
facts
and
the
reasons
of
them
will
be
as
impalpable
to
you
there
as
here
unless
you
can
again
obey
your
novum
organum
then
renouncing
all
your
idols
the
idols
of
the
race
and
of
the
market
of
the
study
and
of
the
theatre
every
national
prejudice
every
vulgar
superstition
every
remnant
of
pedantic
system
every
sentimental
like
or
dislike
must
be
left
behind
you
for
the
induction
of
the
world
problem
you
must
empty
yourself
before
god
will
fill
you
what
can
i
strip
myself
more
i
know
nothing
i
can
do
nothing
i
hope
nothing
i
fear
nothing
i
am
nothing
you
would
gain
something
but
for
what
purpose
for
on
that
depends
your
whole
success
to
be
famous
great
glorious
powerful
beneficent
i
live
the
height
of
my
ambition
small
though
it
be
is
only
to
find
my
place
though
it
were
but
as
a
sweeper
of
chimneys
if
i
dare
wish
if
i
dare
choose
it
would
be
only
this
to
regenerate
one
little
parish
in
the
whole
world
to
do
that
and
die
for
aught
i
care
without
ever
being
recognised
as
the
author
of
my
own
deeds
to
hear
them
if
need
be
imputed
to
another
and
myself
accursed
as
a
fool
if
i
can
but
atone
for
the
sins
of
he
paused
but
his
teacher
understood
him
is
enough
he
said
with
me
tregarva
waits
for
us
near
again
i
warn
you
you
will
hear
nothing
new
you
shall
only
see
what
you
and
all
around
you
have
known
and
not
done
known
and
done
we
have
no
peculiar
doctrines
or
systems
the
old
creeds
are
enough
for
us
but
we
have
obeyed
the
teaching
which
we
received
in
each
and
every
age
and
allowed
ourselves
to
be
built
up
generation
by
generation
as
the
rest
of
christendom
might
have
done
into
a
living
temple
on
the
foundation
which
is
laid
already
and
other
than
which
no
man
can
lay
what
is
that
christ
the
man
he
took
lancelot
by
the
hand
a
peaceful
warmth
diffused
itself
over
his
limbs
the
droning
of
the
organ
sounded
fainter
and
more
faint
the
marble
monuments
grew
dim
and
distant
and
half
unconsciously
he
followed
like
a
child
through
the
cathedral
door
epilogue
i
can
foresee
many
criticisms
and
those
not
unreasonable
ones
on
this
little
book
let
it
be
some
excuse
at
least
for
me
that
i
have
foreseen
them
readers
will
complain
i
doubt
not
of
the
very
mythical
and
mysterious
denouement
of
a
story
which
began
by
things
so
gross
and
palpable
as
and
pauperism
but
is
it
not
true
that
sooner
or
later
exeunt
in
mysterium
out
of
mystery
we
all
came
at
our
birth
and
paupers
sages
and
saints
into
mystery
we
shall
all
return
at
all
events
when
we
die
probably
as
it
seems
to
me
some
of
us
will
return
thither
before
we
die
for
if
the
signs
of
the
times
mean
anything
they
portend
i
humbly
submit
a
somewhat
mysterious
and
mythical
denouement
to
this
very
age
and
to
those
struggles
of
it
which
i
have
herein
attempted
clumsily
enough
to
sketch
we
are
entering
fast
i
both
hope
and
fear
into
the
region
of
prodigy
true
and
false
and
our
will
look
back
on
the
latter
half
of
this
century
and
ask
if
it
were
possible
that
such
things
could
happen
in
an
organised
planet
the
benthamites
will
receive
this
announcement
if
it
ever
meets
their
eyes
with
shouts
of
laughter
be
it
so
nous
verrons
in
the
year
if
they
will
recollect
they
were
congratulating
themselves
on
the
nations
having
grown
too
wise
to
go
to
war
any
more
and
in
so
it
has
been
from
the
beginning
what
did
philosophers
expect
in
what
did
they
see
in
popery
was
to
be
eternal
but
the
reformation
came
nevertheless
rome
was
to
be
eternal
but
alaric
came
jerusalem
was
to
be
eternal
but
titus
came
gomorrha
was
to
be
eternal
i
doubt
not
but
the
it
was
in
the
days
of
noah
so
shall
it
be
in
the
days
of
the
son
of
man
they
were
eating
drinking
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
and
the
flood
came
and
swept
them
all
away
of
course
they
did
not
expect
it
they
went
on
saying
is
the
promise
of
his
coming
for
all
things
continue
as
they
were
from
the
beginning
most
true
but
what
if
they
were
from
the
beginning
over
a
volcano
mouth
what
if
the
method
whereon
things
have
proceeded
since
the
creation
were
as
geology
as
well
as
history
proclaims
a
cataclysmic
method
what
then
why
should
not
this
age
as
all
others
like
it
have
done
end
in
a
cataclysm
and
a
prodigy
and
a
mystery
and
why
should
not
my
little
book
do
likewise
again
readers
will
probably
complain
of
the
fragmentary
and
unconnected
form
of
the
book
let
them
first
be
sure
that
that
is
not
an
integral
feature
of
the
subject
itself
and
therefore
the
very
form
the
book
should
take
do
not
young
men
think
speak
act
just
now
in
this
very
incoherent
fragmentary
way
without
methodic
education
or
habits
of
thought
with
the
various
stereotyped
systems
which
they
have
received
by
tradition
breaking
up
under
them
like
ice
in
a
thaw
with
a
thousand
facts
and
notions
which
they
know
not
how
to
classify
pouring
in
on
them
like
a
flood
a
very
yeasty
state
of
mind
altogether
like
a
mountain
burn
in
a
spring
rain
carrying
down
with
it
stones
sticks
addle
and
drowned
kingfishers
fertilising
salts
and
vegetable
poisons
not
alas
without
a
large
crust
here
and
there
of
sheer
froth
yet
no
heterogeneous
confused
no
fertile
meadows
below
and
no
high
water
no
fishing
it
is
in
the
long
black
droughts
when
the
water
is
foul
from
lowness
and
not
from
height
that
hydras
and
desmidiae
and
rotifers
and
all
uncouth
organisms
bred
of
putridity
begin
to
multiply
and
the
fish
are
sick
for
want
of
a
fresh
and
the
cunningest
artificial
fly
is
of
no
avail
and
the
shrewdest
angler
will
do
nothing
except
with
a
gross
fleshly
worm
or
the
cannibal
bait
of
roe
whereby
parent
fishes
like
competitive
barbarisms
devour
each
other
flesh
and
blood
perhaps
their
own
it
is
when
the
stream
is
clearing
after
a
flood
that
the
fish
will
when
will
the
flood
clear
and
the
fish
come
on
the
feed
again
next
i
shall
be
blamed
for
having
left
untold
the
fate
of
those
characters
who
have
acted
throughout
as
lancelot
satellites
but
indeed
their
only
purpose
consisted
in
their
influence
on
his
development
and
that
of
tregarva
i
do
not
see
that
we
have
any
need
to
follow
them
farther
the
reader
can
surely
conjecture
their
history
for
he
may
be
pretty
certain
that
they
have
gone
the
way
of
the
world
abierunt
ad
plures
for
this
life
or
for
the
next
they
have
done
very
much
what
he
or
i
might
have
done
in
their
place
nothing
nature
brings
very
few
of
her
children
to
perfection
in
these
days
or
any
and
for
grace
which
does
bring
its
children
to
perfection
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
perfection
must
depend
on
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
grace
and
that
again
to
an
awful
extent
the
giver
only
knows
to
how
great
an
extent
on
the
will
of
the
recipients
and
therefore
in
exact
proportion
to
their
lowness
in
the
human
scale
on
the
circumstances
which
environ
them
so
my
characters
are
now
very
much
what
the
reader
might
expect
them
to
be
i
confess
them
to
be
unsatisfactory
so
are
most
things
but
how
can
i
solve
problems
which
fact
has
not
yet
solved
for
me
how
am
i
to
extricate
my
antitypal
characters
when
their
living
types
have
not
yet
extricated
themselves
when
the
age
moves
on
my
story
shall
move
on
with
it
let
it
be
enough
that
my
puppets
have
retreated
in
good
order
and
that
i
am
willing
to
give
to
those
readers
who
have
conceived
something
of
human
interest
for
them
the
latest
accounts
of
their
doings
with
the
exception
that
is
of
mellot
and
sabina
them
i
confess
to
be
an
utterly
mysterious
fragmentary
little
couple
why
not
do
you
not
meet
with
twenty
such
in
the
course
of
your
life
charming
people
who
for
aught
you
know
may
be
opera
folk
from
paris
or
emissaries
from
the
czar
or
disguised
jesuits
or
disguised
angels
who
evidently
a
history
and
a
strange
one
which
you
never
expect
or
attempt
to
fathom
who
interest
you
intensely
for
a
while
and
then
are
whirled
away
again
in
the
great
and
lost
in
the
crowd
for
ever
why
should
you
wish
my
story
to
be
more
complete
than
theirs
is
or
less
romantic
than
theirs
may
be
there
are
more
things
in
london
as
well
as
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamt
of
in
our
philosophy
if
you
but
knew
the
secret
history
of
that
dull
gentleman
opposite
whom
you
sat
at
dinner
yesterday
the
real
thoughts
of
that
chattering
girl
whom
you
took
down
exeunt
in
mysterium
i
say
again
every
human
being
is
a
romance
a
miracle
to
himself
now
and
will
appear
as
one
to
all
the
world
in
that
day
but
now
for
the
rest
and
squire
lavington
first
he
is
a
very
fair
sample
of
the
fate
of
the
british
public
for
he
is
dead
and
buried
and
readers
would
not
have
me
extricate
him
out
of
that
situation
if
you
ask
news
of
the
reason
and
manner
of
his
end
i
can
only
answer
that
like
many
others
he
went
out
as
candles
do
i
believe
he
expressed
general
repentance
for
all
his
sins
all
at
least
of
which
he
was
aware
to
confess
and
repent
of
the
state
of
the
whitford
priors
estate
and
of
the
poor
thereon
was
of
course
more
than
any
minister
of
any
denomination
whatsoever
could
be
required
to
demand
of
him
seeing
that
would
have
involved
a
recognition
of
those
duties
of
property
of
which
the
good
old
gentleman
was
to
the
last
a
staunch
denier
and
which
are
as
yet
seldom
supposed
to
be
included
in
any
christian
creed
catholic
or
other
two
sermons
were
preached
in
whitford
on
the
day
of
his
funeral
one
by
on
the
text
from
job
provided
for
such
occasions
the
ear
heard
him
then
it
blessed
him
etc
etc
the
other
by
the
baptist
preacher
on
two
verses
of
the
psalm
fancy
that
their
houses
shall
endure
for
ever
and
call
the
lands
after
their
own
names

in
honour

no

is

to
the
beasts

perish

the
good
taste
which
was
probably
on
a
par
in
both
cases
the
reader
is
left
to
decide
which
of
the
two
texts
was
most
applicable

no
longer

has
married
to
the
astonishment
of
the
world
in
general
that
man
who
has
been
discovered
not
to
be
quite
as
young
as
he
appeared
his
graces
being
principally
owing
to
a
brutus
wig
which
he
has
now
wisely
discarded
lavington
now
sits
in
state
under
her
husband
ministry
as
the
leader
of
the
religious
world
in
the
fashionable
of
steamingbath
and
derives
her
notions
of
the
past
present
and
future
state
of
the
universe
principally
from
those
two
meek
and
unbiased
periodicals
the

and

to
both
of
which

a
constant
contributor

has
taken
such
an
aversion
to
whitford
since

that
she
has
ceased
to
have
any
connection

unhealthy
locality

funeral
and
was
much
pleased
the
last
time
i
rode
with
him
at
my
informing
him
that
a
certain
picturesque
moorland
which
he
had
been
greatly
admiring
was
his
own
after
all
he
is
excellent
man
and
when
i
met
a
large
party
at
his
house
the
other
day
and
beheld

and
surmullet

and
lachryma

amid
all
the
glory
of
the
whitford
plate
some
of
it
said
to
have
belonged
to
the
altar
of
the
priory
church
four
hundred
years
ago
i
was
deeply
moved
by
the
impressive
tone
in
which
at
the
end
of
a
long
grace
he
prayed
the
daily
bread
of
our
less
favoured
brethren
might
be
mercifully
vouchsafed
to
my
dear
readers
would
you
have
me
even
if
i
could
extricate
him
from
such
an
elysium
by
any
denouement
whatsoever
poor
dear

said
to
be
painting
lean
frescoes
for
the

and
the
vicar
under
the
name
of
father
stylites
of
the
order
of
philumena
is
preaching
impassioned
sermons
to
crowded
congregations
at
george
bedlam
how
can
i
extricate
them
from
that
no
one
has
come
forth
of
it
yet
to
my
knowledge
except
by
paths
whereof
i
shall
use
lessing
saying
may
have
my
whole
hand
full
of
truth
and
yet
find
good
to
open
only
my
little
finger
but
who
cares
for
their
coming
out
they
are
but
two
more
added
to
the
five
hundred
at
whose
moral
suicide
and
dive
into
the
roman
avernus
a
protestant
public
looks
on
with
a
sort
of
savage
satisfaction
crying
only
we
tell
you
so
and
more
than
half
hopes
that
they
will
not
come
back
again
lest
they
should
be
discovered
to
have
learnt
anything
while
they
were
there
what
are
two
among
that
five
hundred
much
more
among
the
five
thousand
who
seem
destined
shortly
to
follow
them
the
banker
thanks
to
barnakill
assistance
is
rapidly
getting
rich
again
who
would
wish
to
stop
him
however
he
is
wiser
on
some
points
at
least
than
he
was
of
yore
he
has
taken
up
the
flax
movement
violently
of
late
perhaps
owing
to
some
hint
of
barnakill
talks
of
nothing
but
chevalier
claussen
and
donellan
and
is
very
anxious
to
advance
capital
to
any
landlord
who
will
grow
flax
on
warnes
method
either
in
england
or
john
bull
however
has
not
yet
awakened
sufficiently
to
listen
to
his
overtures
but
sits
up
in
bed
dolefully
rubbing
his
eyes
and
bemoaning
the
evanishment
of
his
protectionist
dream
altogether
realising
tolerably
he
and
his
land
watts
known
moral
song
concerning
the
sluggard
and
his
garden
lord
minchampstead
again
prospers
either
the
nuns
of
minchampstead
have
left
no
nemesis
behind
them
like
those
of
whitford
or
a
certain
wisdom
and
righteousness
of
his
however
dim
and
imperfect
averts
it
for
a
time
so
as
i
said
he
prospers
and
is
hated
especially
by
his
farmers
to
whom
he
has
just
offered
long
leases
and
a
sliding
they
would
have
hated
him
just
the
same
if
he
had
kept
them
at
and
he
has
not
forgotten
that
but
they
have
they
looked
shy
at
the
leases
because
they
bind
them
to
farm
high
which
they
do
not
know
how
to
do
and
at
the
because
they
think
that
he
expects
wheat
to
rise
again
which
being
a
sensible
man
he
very
probably
does
but
for
my
story
i
certainly
do
not
see
how
to
extricate
him
or
any
one
else
from
farmers
stupidity
greed
and
that
question
must
have
seven
years
more
to
settle
it
before
i
can
say
anything
thereon
still
less
can
i
foreshadow
the
fate
of
his
eldest
son
who
has
just
been
rusticated
from
christ
church
for
riding
one
of
simmon
hacks
through
a
window
especially
as
the
youth
is
reported
to
be
given
to
piquette
and
strong
liquors
and
like
many
noblemen
eldest
sons
is
considered
to
have
the
talent
of
his
father
as
for
the
old
lord
himself
i
have
no
wish
to
change
or
develop
him
in
any
way
except
to
cut
slips
off
him
as
you
do
off
a
willow
and
plant
two
or
three
in
every
county
in
england
let
him
alone
to
work
out
his
own
plot
we
have
not
seen
the
end
of
it
yet
but
whatever
it
will
be
england
has
need
of
him
as
a
between
feudalism
and
for
many
a
day
to
come
if
he
be
not
the
ideal
landlord
he
is
nearer
it
than
any
we
are
like
yet
to
except
one
and
that
after
all
is
lord
vieuxbois
let
him
go
on
like
a
gallant
gentleman
as
he
is
and
prosper
and
he
will
prosper
for
he
fears
god
and
god
is
with
him
he
has
much
to
learn
and
a
little
to
unlearn
he
has
to
learn
that
god
is
a
living
god
now
as
well
as
in
the
middle
ages
to
learn
to
trust
not
in
antique
precedents
but
in
eternal
laws
to
learn
that
his
tenants
just
because
they
are
children
of
god
are
not
to
be
kept
children
but
developed
and
educated
into
sons
to
learn
that
god
grace
like
his
love
is
free
and
that
his
spirit
bloweth
where
it
listeth
and
vindicates
its
own
against
our
narrow
systems
by
revealing
at
times
even
to
nominal
heretics
and
infidels
truths
which
the
catholic
church
must
humbly
receive
as
the
message
of
him
who
is
wider
deeper
more
tolerant
than
even
she
can
be
and
he
is
in
the
way
to
learn
all
this
let
him
go
on
at
what
conclusions
he
will
attain
he
knows
not
nor
do
i
but
this
i
know
that
he
is
on
the
path
to
great
and
true
and
he
is
just
about
to
be
married
too
that
surely
should
teach
him
something
the
papers
inform
me
that
his
bride
elect
is
lord
minchampstead
youngest
daughter
that
should
be
a
noble
mixture
there
should
be
stalwart
offspring
spiritual
as
well
as
physical
born
of
that
intermarriage
of
the
old
and
the
new
we
will
hope
it
perhaps
some
of
my
readers
who
enter
into
my
inner
meaning
may
also
pray
for
it
whom
have
i
to
account
for
besides
crawy
though
some
of
my
readers
may
consider
the
mention
of
him
superfluous
but
to
those
who
do
not
i
may
impart
the
news
that
last
month
in
the
union
workhouse
he
died
and
may
for
aught
we
know
have
ere
this
met
squire
lavington
he
is
supposed
or
at
least
said
to
have
had
a
soul
to
be
saved
as
i
think
a
body
to
be
saved
also
but
what
is
one
more
among
so
many
and
in
an
country
like
this
one
must
learn
to
look
at
things
and
paupers
in
the
mass
the
poor
of
whitford
also
my
dear
readers
i
trust
you
will
not
ask
me
just
now
to
draw
the
horoscope
of
the
whitford
poor
or
of
any
others
really
that
depends
principally
on
but
for
the
present
the
poor
of
whitford
owing
as
it
seems
to
them
and
me
to
quite
other
causes
than
an
market
or
too
rapid
of
their
species
are
growing
more
profligate
reckless
pauperised
year
by
year
complained
sadly
to
me
the
other
day
that
the
were
becoming
and
heavier
had
nearly
reached
indeed
what
they
were
under
the
old
but
there
is
one
who
does
not
complain
but
gives
and
gives
and
stints
herself
to
give
and
weeps
in
silence
and
unseen
over
the
evils
which
she
has
yearly
less
and
less
power
to
stem
for
in
a
darkened
chamber
of
the
fine
house
at
steamingbath
lies
on
a
sofa
honoria
lavington
beautiful
no
more
the
victim
of
some
mysterious
and
agonising
disease
about
which
the
physicians
agree
on
one
point
only
that
it
is
hopeless
the
of
the
lavingtons
is
on
her
and
she
bears
it
there
she
lies
and
prays
and
reads
and
arranges
her
charities
and
writes
little
books
for
children
full
of
the
beloved
name
which
is
for
ever
on
her
lips
she
suffers
none
but
herself
knows
how
much
or
how
strangely
yet
she
is
never
heard
to
sigh
she
weeps
in
secret
she
has
long
ceased
to
plead
for
others
not
for
herself
and
prays
for
them
too
perhaps
some
day
her
prayers
will
yet
he
answered
but
she
greets
all
visitors
with
a
smile
fresh
from
heaven
and
all
who
enter
that
room
leave
it
saddened
and
yet
happy
like
those
who
have
lingered
a
moment
at
the
gates
of
paradise
and
seen
angels
ascending
and
descending
upon
earth
there
she
lies
who
could
wish
her
otherwise
even
doctor
autotheus
maresnest
the
celebrated
mesmeriser
who
though
he
laughs
at
the
resurrection
of
the
lord
is
confidently
reported
to
have
raised
more
than
one
corpse
to
life
himself
was
heard
to
say
after
having
attended
her
professionally
that
her
waking
bliss
and
peace
although
unfortunately
unattributable
even
to
autocatalepsy
much
less
to
somnambulist
exaltation
was
on
the
whole
however
unscientific
almost
as
enviable
there
she
lies
and
will
lie
till
she
dies
the
type
of
thousands
more
martyrs
by
the
pang
without
the
palm
who
find
no
mates
in
this
life
and
yet
may
find
them
in
the
life
to
poor
paul
tregarva
little
he
fancies
how
her
days
run
by
at
least
there
has
been
no
news
since
that
last
scene
in
paul
cathedral
either
of
him
or
lancelot
how
their
strange
teacher
has
fulfilled
his
promise
of
guiding
their
education
whether
they
have
yet
reached
the
country
of
prester
john
whether
indeed
that
caucasian
utopia
has
a
local
and
bodily
existence
or
was
only
used
by
barnakill
to
shadow
out
that
ideal
which
is
as
he
said
of
the
garden
of
eden
always
near
us
underlying
the
actual
as
the
spirit
does
its
body
exhibiting
itself
step
by
step
through
all
the
falsehoods
and
confusions
of
history
and
society
giving
life
to
all
in
it
which
is
not
falsehood
and
decay
on
all
these
questions
i
can
give
my
readers
no
sort
of
answer
perhaps
i
may
as
yet
have
no
answer
to
give
perhaps
i
may
be
afraid
of
giving
one
perhaps
the
times
themselves
are
giving
at
once
cheerfully
and
sadly
in
strange
destructions
and
strange
births
a
better
answer
than
i
can
give
i
have
set
forth
as
far
as
in
me
lay
the
data
of
my
problem
and
surely
if
the
premises
be
given
wise
men
will
not
have
to
look
far
for
the
conclusion
in
homely
english
i
have
given
my
readers
yeast
if
they
be
what
i
take
them
for
they
will
be
able
to
bake
with
it
themselves
and
yet
i
have
brought
lancelot
at
least
perhaps
tregarva
too
to
a
conclusion
and
an
one
which
whoso
reads
may
find
fairly
printed
in
these
pages
henceforth
his
life
must
begin
anew
were
i
to
carry
on
the
thread
of
his
story
continuously
he
would
still
seem
to
have
overleaped
as
vast
a
gulf
as
if
i
had
introduced
him
as
a
man
strange
that
the
death
of
one
of
the
lovers
should
seem
no
complete
termination
to
their
history
when
their
marriage
would
have
been
accepted
by
all
as
the
legitimate
denouement
beyond
which
no
information
was
to
be
expected
as
if
the
history
of
love
always
ended
at
the
altar
oftener
it
only
begins
there
and
all
before
it
is
but
a
mere
longing
to
love
why
should
readers
complain
of
being
refused
the
future
history
of
one
life
when
they
are
in
most
novels
cut
short
by
the
marriage
finale
from
the
biography
of
two
but
if
over
and
above
this
any
reader
should
be
wroth
at
my
having
left
lancelot
history
unfinished
on
questions
in
his
opinion
more
important
than
that
of
love
let
me
entreat
him
to
set
manfully
about
finishing
his
own
history
a
far
more
important
one
to
him
than
lancelot
if
he
shall
complain
that
doubts
are
raised
for
which
no
solution
is
given
that
my
hero
is
brought
into
contradictory
beliefs
without
present
means
of
bringing
them
to
accord
into
passive
acquiescence
in
vast
truths
without
seeing
any
possibility
of
practically
applying
them
let
him
consider
well
whether
such
be
not
his
own
case
let
him
if
he
be
as
most
are
thank
god
when
he
finds
out
that
such
is
his
case
when
he
knows
at
last
that
those
are
most
blind
who
say
they
see
when
he
becomes
at
last
conscious
how
little
he
believes
how
little
he
acts
up
to
that
small
belief
let
him
try
to
right
somewhat
of
the
doubt
confusion
inconsistency
idolatry
within
him
some
of
the
greed
bigotry
recklessness
respectably
superstitious
atheism
around
him
and
perhaps
before
his
new
task
is
finished
lancelot
and
tregarva
may
have
returned
with
a
message
if
not
for
him
for
that
depends
upon
him
having
ears
to
hear
it
yet
possibly
for
strong
lord
minchampstead
probably
for
good
lord
vieuxbois
and
surely
for
the
sinners
and
the
slaves
of
whitford
priors
what
it
will
be
i
know
not
altogether
but
this
i
know
that
if
my
heroes
go
on
as
they
have
set
forth
looking
with
single
mind
for
some
one
ground
of
human
light
and
love
some
everlasting
rock
whereon
to
build
utterly
careless
what
the
building
may
be
howsoever
contrary
to
precedent
and
prejudice
and
the
idols
of
the
day
provided
god
and
nature
and
the
accumulated
lessons
of
all
the
ages
help
them
in
its
construction
then
they
will
find
in
time
the
thing
they
seek
and
see
how
the
will
of
god
may
at
last
be
done
on
earth
even
as
it
is
done
in
heaven
but
alas
between
them
and
it
are
waste
raging
waters
foul
mud
banks
thick
with
dragons
and
sirens
and
many
a
bitter
day
and
blinding
night
in
cold
and
hunger
spiritual
and
perhaps
physical
await
them
for
it
was
a
true
vision
which
john
bunyan
saw
and
one
which
as
the
visions
of
wise
men
are
wont
to
do
meant
far
more
than
the
seer
fancied
when
he
beheld
in
his
dream
that
there
was
indeed
a
land
of
beulah
and
arcadian
shepherd
paradise
on
whose
mountain
tops
the
everlasting
sunshine
lay
but
that
the
way
to
it
as
these
last
three
years
are
preaching
to
us
went
past
the
mouth
of
hell
and
through
the
valley
of
the
