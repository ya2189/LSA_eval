big
and
little
sisters
a
story
of
an
indian
mission
school
by
theodora
jenness
chapter
i
it
was
a
saturday
morning
in
december
at
the
indian
mission
school
two
young
sioux
girls
were
going
up
the
stairs
hannah
straight
tree
and
cordelia
running
bird
it
was
their
saturday
for
cleaning
the
two
girls
drew
a
heavy
breath
in
prospect
of
the
difficult
task
that
confronted
them
the
great
unplastered
mission
building
was
a
chilly
place
throughout
the
winter
and
the
halls
and
stairway
that
morning
were
drafty
from
the
blustering
wind
that
swept
the
dakota
plains
and
came
through
the
outer
doors
below
where
restless
children
kept
going
to
and
fro
continually
the
young
shivered
on
the
upper
landing
and
stepped
back
in
a
sheltered
niche
in
which
the
brooms
were
hanging
they
had
thrown
their
aprons
over
their
heads
and
shoulders
and
were
dreading
to
begin
their
work
my
floor
and
stairs
always
look
nicer
than
your
floor
and
stairs
said
hannah
straight
tree
to
cordelia
running
bird
because
you
have
the
teachers
side
and
that
always
nicer
to
begin
with
than
the
girls
side
answered
cordelia
running
bird
you
know
the
teachers
never
walk
when
you
are
scrubbing
if
they
have
to
go
by
they
walk
tiptoe
and
their
toes
are
sharp
and
clean
and
do
not
make
big
tracks
but
all
the
children
on
my
side
walk
over
the
wet
floor
when
i
am
scrubbing
and
their
shoes
are
big
and
muddy
ugh
big
tracks
they
make
but
i
have
learned
the
motto
every
word
and
i
can
speak
that
when
i
feel
discouraged
with
my
work
cordelia
running
bird
gazed
at
the
motto
while
the
dormitory
girls
flocked
by
and
when
the
hall
was
quiet
she
repeated
it
in
the
peculiar
monotonous
tone
with
which
an
indian
pupil
usually
recites
those
who
faithfully
perform
the
task
of
keeping
clean
the
dark
places
the
cold
places
and
the
rough
places
are
they
to
whom
it
may
indeed
be
said
done
i
shall
not
try
to
learn
the
motto
for
it
makes
my
memory
tired
said
hannah
straight
tree
i
do
not
like
to
think
hard
or
work
hard
i
am
glad
i
have
the
teachers
side
if
you
do
not
think
hard
you
will
have
a
heart
that
is
a
dark
place
like
the
closet
and
it
will
he
hard
to
keep
it
clean
of
wrong
thoughts
like
the
white
mother
talked
about
in
the
motto
means
inside
of
us
as
well
as
places
where
we
live
i
like
to
think
hard
said
cordelia
running
bird
i
heard
the
teacher
tell
the
white
mother
that
i
had
the
best
memory
of
any
girl
and
she
said
it
was
as
good
as
many
white
girls
memories
of
my
age
and
that
is
fourteen
so
i
am
to
speak
the
longest
piece
in
the
christmas
entertainment
ee
cried
hannah
straight
tree
hear
her
brag
because
she
has
a
white
memory
if
the
teacher
praised
me
i
should
be
ashamed
to
tell
it
she
will
not
praise
you
for
you
are
always
very
dumb
in
school
you
will
not
try
to
speak
a
lesson
only
with
the
class
in
concert
said
cordelia
running
bird
i
shall
try
to
finish
very
fast
this
morning
there
are
only
two
more
saturdays
till
christmas
and
i
want
to
the
little
new
blue
dress
for
susie
she
will
wear
it
every
day
when
she
is
here
christmas
many
white
and
indian
visitors
will
be
here
and
you
will
feel
so
proud
because
the
visitors
and
the
school
will
look
at
susie
and
the
and
little
girls
will
always
choose
her
in
the
games
they
would
not
choose
my
little
sister
if
she
played
said
hannah
straight
tree
with
a
sudden
downcast
look
dolly
is
so
shy
i
do
not
know
if
she
would
go
into
the
middle
of
the
ring
if
they
should
choose
her
and
she
would
not
know
the
way
to
choose
back
answered
cordelia
running
bird
ee
she
would
she
would
disputed
hannah
straight
tree
dolly
is
as
brave
and
smart
as
susie
smarter
too
for
she
is
shorter
she
could
play
the
games
if
i
would
let
her
but
you
will
not
replied
the
other
you
must
not
scold
about
my
little
sister
susie
knows
the
motions
in
the
jack
frost
song
so
well
the
teachers
says
that
she
can
motion
with
the
children
in
the
christmas
entertainment
she
does
not
motion
right
said
hannah
straight
tree
she
gets
behind
and
when
they
sing
nips
little
children
on
the
nose
he
pinches
little
children
on
the
toes
he
pulls
little
children
by
the
ears
and
brings
to
their
eyes
the
big
round
tears
she
is
only
nipping
her
nose
when
the
rest
are
pulling
their
ears
but
she
is
so
little
she
looks
cute
and
the
visitors
and
school
will
laugh
at
her
and
praise
her
said
cordelia
running
bird
undismayed
she
will
not
wear
the
blue
dress
in
the
jack
frost
song
she
will
wear
a
red
dress
from
my
mission
box
i
asked
the
white
mother
if
i
could
not
buy
the
red
cloth
for
an
entertainment
dress
for
susie
with
the
money
that
she
paid
because
i
tended
baby
one
month
till
the
came
and
she
said
if
i
wished
i
could
put
a
nickel
on
the
missionary
plate
twenty
sundays
which
would
be
one
dollar
and
so
buy
the
cloth
she
said
it
would
be
teaching
me
to
give
as
well
as
to
receive
she
keeps
the
nickel
with
the
school
pennies
and
i
take
one
every
sunday
and
you
lift
your
hand
so
high
and
drop
the
nickel
very
too
loud
so
all
the
school
can
hear
when
amy
swimmer
passes
you
the
plate
cried
hannah
straight
tree
just
like
it
says
i
am
putting
on
a
nickel
and
the
rest
can
only
give
one
penny
and
earned
my
money
and
the
pennies
are
money
that
their
people
sent
them
you
are
very
jealous
was
the
calm
reply
i
shall
hire
a
large
girl
to
cut
it
fine
and
help
make
the
red
dress
very
fast
the
sewing
teacher
has
not
time
for
such
dresses
it
will
look
cordelia
running
bird
smiled
prospectively
displaying
small
white
teeth
and
two
round
dimples
christmas
evening
i
shall
curl
susie
hair
with
a
slate
pencil
and
she
will
wear
fine
shoes
and
black
stockings
with
the
red
dress
my
father
brought
them
with
the
blue
dress
and
i
keep
them
in
my
cupboard
you
are
much
vain
because
your
father
is
an
agency
policeman
and
earns
money
so
he
buys
nice
things
for
susie
hannah
straight
tree
said
with
growing
envy
dolly
has
to
wear
the
issue
goods
and
she
will
not
look
pretty
christmas
time
her
dress
will
be
a
kind
that
looks
black
and
lucinda
only
knows
a
way
to
make
it
look
like
an
indian
dress
she
will
wear
cowskin
shoes
so
much
too
large
and
very
stockings
if
her
dress
gets
torn
before
she
comes
lucinda
will
not
mend
it
nice
only
draw
it
up
so
puckery
very
lots
of
grease
spots
will
be
on
it
and
her
hair
will
be
so
snarly
i
shall
have
to
comb
her
very
fast
my
little
sister
is
not
torn
and
dirty
any
time
said
cordelia
running
bird
for
my
mother
came
to
mission
school
when
she
was
young
and
learned
the
neat
way
my
big
sister
only
went
to
camp
school
just
a
little
while
said
hannah
straight
tree
when
my
mother
died
she
had
to
stay
at
home
and
work
and
keep
my
little
sister
now
again
my
father
has
got
married
and
lucinda
wants
to
come
to
school
and
bring
my
little
sister
dolly
was
five
birthdays
last
thanksgiving
dinner
susie
was
five
birthdays
while
i
was
at
home
vacation
i
would
be
so
glad
if
she
could
stay
at
school
next
time
she
comes
but
she
was
sliding
on
the
ice
and
she
fell
and
broke
herself
right
here
cordelia
touched
her
collarbone
she
is
mended
but
my
mother
is
afraid
to
leave
her
with
the
children
now
she
added
but
next
year
she
will
leave
her
if
your
big
and
little
sister
come
to
school
they
will
have
nice
mission
things
but
they
can
not
for
my
father
hannah
straight
tree
said
with
deepening
gloom
he
would
let
lucinda
but
he
says
dolly
is
too
short
she
must
be
ten
birthdays
when
she
comes
lucinda
loves
dolly
so
she
will
not
leave
her
and
my
stepmother
is
lucinda
will
be
birthdays
much
too
old
to
come
to
school
when
dolly
is
ten
birthdays
you
can
tell
your
father
the
teachers
like
the
indian
children
come
to
school
when
they
are
very
short
so
they
can
grow
them
more
said
cordelia
running
bird
i
told
him
but
he
says
he
does
not
want
his
children
very
he
says
i
came
to
school
so
short
that
they
have
grown
me
too
i
tell
him
i
am
very
but
he
tells
me
i
do
not
know
white
from
indian
lucinda
is
so
sad
she
will
not
try
she
looks
so
horrid
dolly
too
i
am
much
ashamed
of
them
i
shall
not
speak
to
them
before
the
white
visitors
and
the
teachers
only
down
at
camp
then
you
will
be
very
wrong
said
cordelia
running
bird
i
would
not
be
ashamed
to
speak
to
my
own
people
anywhere
ee
you
talk
so
good
because
your
father
wears
a
grand
coat
and
trousers
and
your
mother
head
is
in
a
hood
said
hannah
straight
tree
excitedly
my
father
wears
a
very
funny
indian
clothes
and
feathers
in
his
hairs
and
my
big
sister
head
is
in
a
shawl
all
the
girls
will
say
on
christmas
looked
just
like
a
fairy
in
the
jack
frost
song
we
shall
give
her
very
lots
of
candy
from
our
christmas
bags
dolly
knows
the
jack
frost
motions
i
taught
her
and
she
did
them
with
the
children
down
at
camp
but
i
shall
not
tell
the
teacher
for
dolly
has
no
pretty
things
to
wear
that
is
why
i
let
her
play
the
games
if
my
father
saw
her
in
the
jack
frost
songs
and
games
he
would
be
glad
she
is
so
smart
and
just
like
he
would
let
her
come
to
school
but
you
would
be
so
sorry
if
my
big
and
little
sister
came
to
school
you
think
susie
is
a
girl
and
dolly
is
a
very
indian
you
do
not
speak
true
was
the
denial
i
should
not
be
sorry
and
i
do
not
think
susie
is
a
girl
she
is
very
too
but
you
do
not
wish
dolly
would
be
in
the
jack
frost
song
and
wear
a
red
dress
just
like
susie
challenged
hannah
straight
tree
disconcerting
her
companion
with
the
piercing
gaze
habitual
to
her
race
though
not
quite
innocent
of
all
the
charges
laid
to
her
cordelia
running
bird
was
a
truthful
girl
and
she
would
not
disown
a
failing
plainly
set
before
her
by
another
she
evaded
her
companion
gaze
in
silence
you
are
thinking
hard
you
can
not
say
it
was
the
fierce
indictment
from
hannah
straight
tree
but
i
wish
she
could
be
in
another
motion
song
and
wear
a
green
dress
came
the
hesitating
answer
ee
you
think
they
would
not
watch
susie
all
the
time
if
dolly
motioned
jack
frost
too
and
looked
like
susie
and
you
do
not
wish
that
dolly
had
a
blue
dress
only
ugly
green
and
looked
like
susie
in
the
games
said
hannah
straight
tree
but
little
white
girls
do
not
need
to
wear
alike
dresses
was
cordelia
running
bird
argument
because
the
little
white
visitor
last
summer
looked
just
like
a
fairy
in
the
pretty
pink
with
white
lace
did
her
sister
have
to
wish
another
little
white
girl
looked
the
very
too
same
she
asked
there
is
a
difference
but
i
can
not
tell
answered
hannah
straight
tree
taking
down
her
broom
in
puzzled
moodiness
the
two
girls
went
about
their
work
in
a
most
unfortunate
state
of
mind
hannah
discontent
at
dolly
lack
and
susie
plenty
and
the
prospect
of
cordelia
triumphs
through
the
petted
little
sister
grew
upon
her
and
resulted
in
trials
to
cordelia
who
was
much
discomfited
by
the
force
of
her
companion
criticisms
cordelia
running
bird
was
a
bright
attractive
girl
quite
conscientious
in
discharging
her
industrial
and
school
duties
and
much
interested
in
the
but
in
a
private
talk
the
very
day
before
the
teachers
had
referred
to
her
in
some
perplexity
i
wish
cordelia
running
bird
were
a
little
different
said
the
she
leads
her
class
and
is
a
credit
to
the
school
in
most
respects
but
she
is
rather
too
ambitious
to
outdo
others
it
creates
jealousy
i
have
observed
that
she
is
notional
in
the
making
of
her
dresses
said
the
sewing
teacher
she
is
apt
to
want
the
skirt
a
little
wider
and
the
hem
a
deeper
than
the
regular
uniform
and
she
asks
to
have
more
buttonholes
which
means
more
buttons
and
an
extra
ruffle
on
the
waist
but
she
begs
me
so
politely
and
appears
so
thankful
if
i
grant
these
trifling
favors
that
i
find
myself
indulging
her
too
frequently
she
does
the
extra
work
herself
cheerfully
and
neatly
if
not
speedily
but
closely
watched
by
others
she
has
learned
as
if
by
intuition
that
variety
is
the
spice
of
life
but
she
seems
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
she
makes
the
other
girls
discontented
but
she
is
so
pleasant
and
obedient
as
a
rule
that
minor
faults
may
be
forgiven
her
the
white
mother
charitably
concluded
chapter
ii
as
something
quite
unusual
at
that
season
in
the
dakotas
there
had
been
a
thaw
the
day
before
and
a
great
quantity
of
mud
had
been
tracked
in
on
the
girls
side
by
the
sewing
classes
coming
from
the
schoolhouse
separate
from
the
main
mission
building
to
the
upstairs
room
in
which
the
sewing
work
was
done
hannah
straight
tree
quickly
swept
her
portion
of
the
hall
for
there
was
but
little
mud
on
the
teachers
side
and
was
proceeding
to
her
stairs
before
cordelia
running
bird
was
half
way
along
her
floor
you
have
not
taken
up
your
dirt
you
have
swept
it
over
on
my
side
exclaimed
cordelia
running
bird
who
with
all
her
close
attention
to
her
own
work
kept
a
sharp
eye
on
the
other
movements
there
is
little
and
it
will
not
be
much
work
to
take
it
up
with
yours
was
hannah
reply
when
we
finished
yesterday
i
lent
our
dustpan
to
the
middle
dormitory
girls
they
said
theirs
was
too
broken
and
they
lost
it
now
they
say
they
can
borrow
the
south
dormitory
dustpan
and
they
shall
not
hunt
ours
you
can
always
find
things
better
than
i
can
so
you
must
hunt
it
and
take
up
my
dirt
was
hannah
straight
tree
demand
tokee
how
strange
you
talk
exclaimed
cordelia
running
bird
in
amazement
the
dormitory
girls
must
ask
for
a
new
dustpan
if
they
break
theirs
it
is
not
the
rule
to
lend
things
for
it
makes
confusion
if
you
lent
the
dustpan
you
must
find
it
and
take
up
your
dirt
for
i
have
more
to
do
than
you
it
is
number
and
you
can
tell
it
when
you
see
it
you
are
very
cross
as
well
as
proud
and
vain
and
you
have
learned
the
motto
every
word
if
i
had
learned
the
motto
i
should
try
to
be
good
said
hannah
straight
tree
the
motto
does
not
say
a
girl
can
tell
us
we
must
do
a
work
that
is
not
ours
and
we
must
mind
her
i
shall
sweep
your
dirt
back
was
the
warm
reply
cordelia
running
bird
gave
her
broom
a
sudden
push
and
sent
the
sweepings
flying
backward
in
a
cloud
now
look
how
mean
you
are
again
i
have
to
sweep
my
floor
cried
hannah
straight
tree
angrily
proud
vain
cross
mean
she
counted
the
four
failings
on
her
fingers
not
the
least
bit
do
i
care
replied
cordelia
running
bird
stung
beyond
endurance
by
hannah
taunts
i
was
not
cross
at
first
but
now
i
am
because
you
call
me
four
bad
names
i
am
now
glad
your
little
sister
can
not
play
the
games
or
motion
in
one
song
or
even
have
an
ugly
green
dress
i
am
not
sorry
that
your
big
and
little
sister
can
not
come
to
school
and
very
much
i
wish
i
had
not
learned
the
motto
here
the
young
sioux
girl
who
was
compelled
to
battle
with
hereditary
pride
and
stubbornness
in
every
effort
to
do
right
forgot
the
white
mother
admonition
that
the
heart
might
be
a
dark
place
and
a
cold
place
needing
to
be
cleansed
of
evil
thoughts
hannah
straight
tree
did
not
hunt
the
dustpan
but
with
perseverance
worthy
of
a
better
cause
she
brushed
the
sweepings
from
her
floor
and
stairs
upon
a
ragged
fan
which
she
discovered
in
a
corner
and
dropping
them
into
the
took
them
out
of
doors
cordelia
brought
a
from
her
cupboard
in
the
playroom
and
applied
it
as
an
inconvenient
dustpan
meanwhile
dustpan
number
remained
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
middle
dormitory
closet
where
it
had
been
pushed
in
the
rush
of
clearing
up
the
day
before
cordelia
running
bird
work
of
making
clean
her
floor
and
stairs
was
even
harder
than
she
had
expected
never
had
there
seemed
so
many
errands
to
and
fro
by
those
who
did
the
weekly
cleaning
in
the
three
dormitories
numbering
quite
a
force
the
thaw
had
ended
in
a
freezing
snow
squall
in
the
night
but
a
sufficient
quantity
of
mud
was
clinging
to
the
broad
soles
of
the
government
shoes
that
tramped
across
cordelia
wet
floor
to
insure
a
startling
trail
of
footprints
i
can
not
keep
them
up
they
come
again
so
fast
she
murmured
to
herself
in
grim
despair
while
wringing
out
her
to
attack
a
line
of
tracks
imprinted
by
the
largest
girl
in
school
in
going
to
and
from
the
laundry
to
dispose
of
sheets
and
pictures
of
the
ugly
issue
shoes
i
will
not
wear
them
i
am
wearing
kid
store
shoes
my
father
buys
for
every
day
the
dormitory
girls
are
and
i
wish
they
could
not
walk
one
step
only
lie
in
bed
she
was
overheard
by
hannah
straight
tree
coming
up
the
girls
stairs
at
that
moment
hannah
own
work
had
been
done
with
little
difficulty
and
she
had
obtained
permission
to
help
the
middle
dormitory
girls
for
reasons
all
her
own
the
reckless
speech
was
repeated
to
the
dormitory
girls
by
hannah
straight
tree
much
to
their
displeasure
the
dormitory
girls
are
and
she
wishes
they
could
not
walk
one
step
only
lie
in
bed
exclaimed
the
largest
girl
sitting
down
on
a
to
discuss
the
matter
then
we
should
be
cripples
and
tokee
how
many
cripples
there
would
be
if
they
came
from
both
the
other
dormitories
into
this
to
lie
down
with
the
middle
dormitory
girls
there
would
be
one
cripple
in
each
bed
and
in
one
there
would
be
two
cripples
said
a
broom
girl
who
was
quite
expert
at
figures
having
studied
on
the
problem
with
the
aid
of
representing
cripples
this
portrayal
of
the
startling
situation
if
cordelia
running
wish
could
be
fulfilled
increased
the
shock
of
indignation
in
the
dormitories
ee
cried
one
we
hate
the
ugly
government
shoes
of
course
and
wish
that
we
could
wear
the
nice
shoes
from
our
mission
boxes
every
day
but
we
can
not
only
sundays
and
we
have
to
change
them
after
and
when
we
wear
our
best
clothes
for
white
visitors
cordelia
running
bird
will
not
wear
the
government
shoes
because
her
father
is
an
agency
policeman
and
can
buy
store
shoes
for
every
day
i
was
always
much
ashamed
of
my
big
feet
and
now
i
am
more
ashamed
complained
the
largest
girl
if
the
dormitory
girls
are
every
large
girl
in
this
school
is
cordelia
was
very
cross
about
the
dustpan
too
but
we
can
pay
her
back
said
hannah
straight
tree
adding
fresh
fuel
to
the
fire
now
i
shall
not
show
her
how
to
the
little
blue
dress
said
the
largest
girl
who
was
quite
famous
at
embroidery
and
had
partly
promised
to
instruct
cordelia
running
bird
in
her
work
that
day
and
i
shall
not
help
her
make
the
little
red
dress
as
she
will
be
wanting
me
next
week
resolved
a
south
dormitory
bed
girl
emma
two
bears
who
was
standing
in
the
doorway
emma
was
the
most
experienced
dressmaker
of
the
large
girls
class
and
was
generous
as
a
rule
in
helping
younger
girls
i
am
sorry
now
that
i
cut
and
made
the
little
blue
waist
but
i
did
not
think
she
would
so
soon
be
wishing
me
a
cripple
and
you
need
not
praise
the
little
blue
and
red
dresses
if
she
gets
them
done
but
i
am
sure
she
can
not
gloried
hannah
straight
tree
ee
we
will
not
we
will
call
them
ugly
issue
goods
said
one
of
the
girls
or
watch
her
little
sister
in
the
jack
frost
song
said
another
we
will
shut
our
eyes
exclaimed
another
and
the
and
short
girls
need
not
choose
susie
in
the
games
came
from
another
we
will
tell
them
not
to
they
will
choose
dolly
cried
a
fifth
but
dolly
looks
so
horrid
i
am
much
ashamed
of
her
was
hannah
straight
tree
answer
cordelia
running
bird
heard
the
fierce
discussion
through
the
open
door
near
which
she
knelt
at
work
and
the
bitter
tears
ran
down
her
face
when
at
length
her
work
was
done
as
well
as
she
was
able
and
the
last
stair
wiped
she
went
back
upstairs
on
tiptoe
to
inspect
her
floor
and
see
if
it
was
dry
she
was
met
by
hannah
straight
tree
on
the
upper
landing
carrying
a
pail
of
scrub
water
mixed
with
ashes
from
the
dormitory
hannah
set
it
on
the
top
stair
and
then
glanced
wickedly
at
cordelia
through
eyes
that
meant
mischief
what
if
i
should
tip
it
over
she
said
ee
you
must
not
it
would
freeze
and
i
should
have
to
scald
my
hands
with
too
hot
water
thawing
it
exclaiming
cordelia
running
bird
rushing
to
prevent
her
in
her
haste
to
keep
the
pail
from
being
overturned
cordelia
hit
it
with
her
foot
upsetting
it
herself
the
stairs
were
deluged
with
the
contents
hannah
straight
tree
fell
back
with
a
laugh
now
see
what
you
have
done
yourself
i
did
not
spill
one
drop
you
can
not
say
i
did
cordelia
running
bird
burst
into
upbraiding
exclamations
in
dakota
which
because
they
wished
them
to
learn
to
speak
english
was
a
forbidden
language
in
the
school
except
on
sundays
and
on
holidays
by
an
odd
mishap
of
memory
cordelia
was
apt
to
break
the
rule
in
moments
of
excitement
and
she
knew
the
penalty
too
well
now
you
have
talked
dakota
and
you
must
report
yourself
hannah
straight
tree
said
triumphantly
you
wished
the
dormitory
girls
would
have
to
lie
in
bed
now
you
must
lie
in
bed
yourself
you
can
not
or
speak
to
anyone
the
unclean
water
froze
upon
the
stairs
and
cordelia
running
work
of
thawing
it
with
hot
water
was
a
long
and
painful
process
when
it
was
accomplished
though
but
poorly
she
went
upstairs
a
second
time
passing
through
the
front
hall
to
the
white
mother
room
to
report
that
she
had
spoken
in
dakota
again
cordelia
how
can
you
forget
so
often
said
the
young
white
mother
in
a
seriously
inquiring
tone
the
little
indian
girl
excitement
had
now
given
place
to
discouragement
she
was
silent
for
some
time
then
she
murmured
an
original
defense
the
cross
thoughts
come
in
indian
and
i
speak
them
out
that
way
hateful
means
much
more
in
indian
than
in
english
dakota
is
my
own
language
and
it
tells
me
how
to
scold
just
right
no
dear
just
wrong
was
the
reply
then
looking
at
the
draggled
little
figure
with
head
drooped
moodily
and
smarting
hands
locked
tightly
at
the
sides
the
white
mother
added
you
have
had
a
cold
hard
time
this
morning
in
the
hall
i
know
have
you
been
cross
about
your
work
the
gentle
voice
invited
confidence
but
it
did
not
melt
cordelia
running
bird
yes
i
was
very
cross
at
hannah
straight
tree
and
the
dormitory
girls
i
called
the
dormitory
girls
a
name
and
then
a
pail
of
very
dirty
water
was
tipped
over
on
my
stairs
so
again
i
had
to
clean
them
and
i
screamed
at
hannah
straight
tree
in
dakota
did
hannah
tip
it
over
no
i
tipped
it
over
with
all
her
sense
of
injury
cordelia
running
bird
would
not
tell
tales
to
divide
the
blame
the
white
mother
saw
that
there
was
more
than
she
knew
of
connected
with
the
trouble
in
the
hall
but
seeing
that
the
race
mood
was
upon
cordelia
she
forbore
all
further
questions
it
has
often
been
explained
that
if
the
older
pupils
spoke
dakota
very
much
the
little
ones
would
speak
it
too
and
not
learn
english
as
they
should
she
said
i
sorry
that
the
cross
thoughts
caused
you
to
forget
cordelia
running
bird
i
am
very
cross
now
said
cordelia
fearing
her
confession
might
be
misconstrued
as
a
repentance
i
have
enemies
that
i
am
hating
very
hard
i
shall
be
thinking
indian
thoughts
about
them
while
i
lie
in
bed
i
hope
the
cross
thoughts
will
leave
you
if
you
lie
in
bed
where
you
can
be
alone
and
try
to
drive
them
out
i
will
send
your
dinner
to
the
dormitory
said
the
white
mother
i
can
not
eat
one
bite
for
many
days
i
wish
to
starve
cordelia
running
bird
said
as
she
turned
away
chapter
iii
the
girls
had
finished
working
in
the
dormitories
and
had
gone
below
cordelia
running
bird
was
relieved
that
she
would
not
have
to
meet
them
and
endure
such
looks
as
they
might
give
though
not
allowed
to
speak
to
her
going
to
her
corner
in
the
south
dormitory
she
put
on
her
nightgown
and
crept
into
bed
she
hid
her
head
beneath
the
blankets
to
shut
out
the
sounds
below
in
which
she
was
to
have
no
part
for
several
hours
but
though
cordelia
running
bird
was
in
solitude
her
sharp
ears
caught
the
noise
of
romping
children
in
the
playroom
and
the
frequent
dropping
of
the
upon
the
narrow
individual
cupboards
indicating
an
excessive
rummaging
of
shelves
cordelia
knew
full
well
the
prying
habits
of
the
indian
children
i
am
glad
i
have
the
red
dress
in
my
trunk
but
they
will
meddle
with
my
other
things
and
look
at
susie
blue
dress
and
then
roll
it
up
in
such
bad
wrinkles
she
said
to
herself
just
like
they
will
drop
a
skein
of
silk
and
tramp
it
with
their
feet
till
it
is
very
dirty
then
some
girl
will
pick
it
up
to
sew
her
doll
clothes
and
there
will
not
be
enough
for
susie
dress
cordelia
running
bird
held
her
breath
as
these
thoughts
came
to
her
but
i
do
not
know
if
i
can
it
now
for
there
is
no
one
to
teach
me
that
i
know
of
just
like
hannah
straight
tree
and
the
dormitory
girls
will
tell
the
whole
school
to
hate
me
and
they
will
if
i
can
not
get
a
large
girl
to
help
make
the
red
dress
and
i
try
to
do
it
all
alone
it
will
fit
so
bad
and
i
can
not
get
it
done
in
time
what
if
i
should
tell
my
mother
to
have
susie
stay
at
camp
and
not
once
come
inside
the
yard
christmas
time
then
she
would
not
need
the
dresses
and
they
could
not
call
them
issue
goods
and
not
choose
susie
in
the
games
and
shut
their
eyes
at
her
cordelia
lay
very
still
but
the
thought
of
susie
missing
the
festivities
by
staying
in
the
big
building
in
the
mission
pasture
where
the
indian
visitors
camped
in
winter
was
put
from
her
in
short
order
susie
shall
not
stay
in
camp
i
shall
find
a
way
to
get
the
dresses
done
and
she
shall
motion
jack
frost
and
see
the
christmas
tree
i
shall
tell
them
i
am
tired
of
playing
silly
games
and
susie
shall
not
play
either
so
they
can
not
leave
her
out
and
i
shall
tell
the
school
they
must
not
watch
susie
motion
for
they
are
such
horrid
indians
they
would
scare
her
very
bad
when
hannah
straight
tree
big
and
little
sister
come
into
the
playroom
i
shall
walk
close
up
to
them
and
pull
my
dress
away
and
look
at
it
so
sharp
and
say
so
hannah
hears
me
wild
indians
have
so
many
grease
spots
i
am
much
afraid
of
catching
them
while
plotting
these
misdeeds
cordelia
running
bird
fell
asleep
a
young
girl
from
the
teachers
table
brought
her
dinner
on
a
tray
and
set
it
by
the
bed
without
awaking
her
she
did
not
wake
up
until
near
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
she
found
that
the
white
mother
had
stolen
into
the
dormitory
with
a
small
book
which
she
had
placed
upon
the
pillow
there
was
a
narrow
white
ribbon
frayed
and
yellow
wound
around
the
book
and
tied
on
one
side
in
a
bow
the
rooms
below
now
were
quiet
for
the
wind
had
lulled
and
the
entire
school
was
out
of
doors
looking
from
the
window
near
her
bed
cordelia
saw
the
broad
white
plains
illumined
with
brilliant
sunshine
and
the
girls
exercising
on
the
glittering
crust
of
snow
occasioned
by
the
thaw
the
little
girls
were
sliding
down
hill
on
boards
and
broken
shovels
and
everything
indeed
that
could
be
seized
on
for
coasting
a
group
of
large
and
girls
were
walking
over
the
mission
pasture
stretching
for
a
mile
on
every
side
another
band
of
girls
was
packed
into
a
long
wide
on
the
point
of
starting
with
the
white
mother
to
the
little
log
post
office
down
the
river
very
lots
of
fun
and
i
am
being
punished
here
in
bed
cordelia
said
to
herself
mournfully
now
the
starts
and
very
loud
the
ring
the
white
mother
drives
and
she
must
hold
the
lines
so
tight
for
very
fast
the
horses
want
to
go
we
go
to
the
post
office
by
the
on
saturday
and
this
day
it
is
the
p
and
r
there
are
no
q
so
it
is
my
turn
very
fast
i
meant
to
so
i
could
spare
the
time
to
go
ee
there
is
hannah
straight
tree
in
my
place
she
made
me
talk
dakota
and
get
punished
now
she
gets
my
and
cordelia
running
bird
threw
herself
back
upon
the
pillow
giving
vent
to
wild
resentful
tears
when
the
tears
had
spent
themselves
the
indian
girl
raised
her
head
and
saw
the
little
book
on
the
other
pillow
tokee
the
white
mother
put
it
here
she
always
keeps
it
and
it
means
that
i
can
look
at
it
now
cordelia
unwound
the
ribbon
opening
the
little
book
annie
bible
and
i
never
thought
of
her
just
like
i
am
forgetting
her
so
fast
here
is
helen
letter
i
shall
read
that
first
illustration
she
read
the
little
note
slowly
she
took
a
little
white
note
from
a
dainty
envelope
and
read
it
slowly
but
with
understanding
that
spoke
of
previous
acquaintance
with
the
words
will
you
let
this
little
bible
be
your
friend
and
guide
as
i
have
tried
to
have
it
for
my
friend
and
guide
since
i
have
been
a
king
daughter
i
have
marked
some
verses
i
have
learned
and
have
recited
in
the
meeting
of
our
circle
and
i
wish
that
you
might
care
to
learn
them
and
recite
them
in
your
meeting
at
the
school
the
king
daughters
in
the
far
east
love
to
think
about
the
indian
girls
away
out
west
who
are
also
members
of
our
circle
is
it
a
sweet
thought
annie
that
although
so
widely
separated
we
are
all

helen
merriam
hartford
aged
it
came
in
annie
mission
box
and
helen
was
her
unknown
white
friend
said
cordelia
running
bird
as
she
put
the
letter
back
into
the
envelope
i
shall
next
read
annie
letter
and
she
took
another
little
missive
from
the
bible
written
with
a
pencil
on
the
tablet
paper
of
the
school
in
wavering
penmanship
that
showed
the
weakness
of
the
writer
hand
cordelia
read
annie
running
bird
will
leave
this
bible
to
cordelia
running
bird
my
sister
for
i
can
not
carry
it
to
heaven
and
in
heaven
i
shall
not
need
to
read
the
words
that
jesus
spoke
on
earth
for
i
shall
hear
him
speak
up
there
but
cordelia
will
not
just
yet
be
bearing
jesus
speak
up
there
and
she
will
need
to
read
this
bible
and
must
mind
just
what
it
tells
her
dear
cordelia
you
can
have
this
bible
for
your
own
when
you
are
fourteen
birthdays
so
you
will
be
old
enough
to
take
good
care
of
it
and
read
it
very
lots
but
if
you
want
to
borrow
it
before
it
is
your
own
the
white
mother
will
please
lend
it
to
you
so
you
always
give
it
back
and
do
not
lose
the
letters
and
the
pieces
of
my
hairs
that
will
be
in
it
i
did
not
learn
all
of
helen
verses
for
the
king
daughters
meeting
for
i
got
too
sick
to
study
and
my
memory
feels
so
queer
i
have
put
a
cross
behind
the
ones
i
learned
and
dear
cordelia
wilt
you
try
to
learn
them
too
and
all
the
rest
that
helen
marked
the
one
i
tried
to
think
of
most
is
matthew
chapter
dear
sister
for
i
can
not
live
much
longer
i
am
so
pained
with
the
hard
coughing
all
the
time
these
words
i
write
so
you
will
not
forget
me
i
wish
to
see
my
father
and
my
mother
and
my
little
sister
very
much
but
if
i
can
not
you
must
give
my
love
to
them
and
all
my
other
friends
and
tell
them
they
must
meet
me
in
the
better
world
and
you
must
too
so
again
i
say
dear
sister
annie
running
bird
aged
write
to
helen
and
my
love
she
lies
at
the
agency
she
sleeps
with
those
that
are
happy
mused
cordelia
looking
at
the
lock
of
hair
with
reverent
eyes
it
was
very
cold
one
year
ago
this
winter
when
she
had
the
so
hard
it
made
her
lungs
so
sick
she
could
not
live
my
mother
had
the
fever
very
long
and
hard
at
home
and
could
not
come
to
watch
her
my
father
came
but
could
not
stay
long
for
my
mother
was
so
sick
but
the
teachers
took
good
care
of
annie
and
the
large
girls
helped
them
i
could
only
sit
by
her
in
daytime
for
the
teachers
said
i
was
too
young
to
stay
up
nights
the
dormitory
girls
were
very
kind
to
annie
and
they
used
to
sit
up
nights
when
they
had
worked
all
day
and
were
so
tired
to
watch
her
emma
two
bears
has
a
sweet
song
and
one
night
when
she
was
watching
annie
and
there
was
a
blizzard
and
the
wind
cried
very
loud
like
many
dogs
all
round
the
house
annie
was
afraid
so
she
asked
would
emma
sing
sweet
by
and
by
and
emma
sang
it
louder
than
the
wind
but
very
sweet
annie
said
it
made
her
feel
so
happy
that
again
she
would
not
be
afraid
and
once
more
when
annie
could
not
eat
one
bite
of
anything
and
was
so
very
faint
hannah
straight
tree
thought
that
she
could
drink
some
rosebud
porridge
so
she
ran
away
without
permission
and
waded
through
the
deep
snow
to
the
rosebushes
up
the
river
to
pick
off
some
buds
to
make
the
porridge
she
froze
her
shortest
right
side
toe
and
a
wild
steer
watched
her
very
fierce
but
hannah
straight
tree
did
not
care
for
she
was
all
the
time
thinking
annie
was
so
faint
and
annie
drank
a
little
porridge
and
told
hannah
she
was
very
glad
indeed
and
they
did
not
punish
hannah
for
the
rosebuds
were
for
annie
when
the
indian
preacher
told
at
annie
funeral
how
she
was
so
good
and
learned
so
many
bible
verses
for
the
king
daughters
meetings
there
was
much
crying
in
the
schoolhouse
for
the
girls
all
felt
so
bad
and
before
i
got
into
the
wagon
with
my
father
when
we
carried
annie
to
the
agency
hannah
straight
tree
whispered
that
she
did
not
want
to
sleep
with
anyone
but
me
and
if
they
put
another
girl
in
bed
with
her
she
would
be
sure
to
turn
her
back
and
never
say
one
word
to
her
now
the
dormitory
girls
and
hannah
straight
tree
are
my
enemies
the
verse
that
annie
tried
to
think
of
most
is
all
about
enemies
i
can
not
read
it
just
now
i
shall
read
some
other
verses
first
many
of
the
verses
her
sister
had
marked
were
familiar
to
cordelia
for
as
annie
had
requested
she
had
been
allowed
to
take
the
little
bible
when
in
thoughtful
mood
perhaps
when
kept
within
doors
on
a
stormy
sunday
afternoon
she
had
read
them
often
asking
explanation
of
the
hard
words
from
the
teachers
and
had
learned
a
number
of
the
simplest
ones
in
preparation
for
her
own
admission
to
the
king
daughters
circle
which
would
be
before
long
she
had
hoped
here
is
one
about
the
tongue
that
has
the
straight
marks
helen
made
and
annie
cross
behind
it
this
i
have
not
learned
to
say
cordelia
running
bird
read
aloud
slowly
so
the
tongue
is
a
little
member
and
great
things
behold
how
great
a
matter
a
little
fire
that
means
to
brag
with
the
tongue
and
make
folks
very
cross
hannah
straight
tree
bragged
because
her
floor
and
stairs
are
always
nicer
than
my
floor
and
stairs
cordelia
said
but
just
like
i
have
bragged
some
too
she
added
my
tongue
has
talked
so
much
because
my
father
is
an
agency
policeman
and
my
little
sister
has
nice
things
and
i
bragged
about
my
white
memory
and
my
store
shoes
but
i
was
only
talking
to
myself
about
the
ugly
issue
shoes
and
hannah
straight
tree
went
and
told
it
she
turned
the
leaves
and
found
another
text
soft
answer
turneth
away
wrath
but
grievous
words
stir
up
i
did
not
speak
soft
when
i
told
hannah
straight
tree
she
was
very
dumb
in
school
and
i
was
glad
dolly
could
not
motion
in
a
single
song
or
even
have
an
ugly
green
dress
and
i
was
not
sorry
that
her
big
and
little
sister
could
not
come
to
school
and
dolly
and
lucinda
have
not
said
mean
things
to
me
so
why
should
i
be
cross
at
them
but
hannah
would
not
find
the
dustpan
and
take
up
her
dirt
and
that
was
very
mean
now
here
is
one
that
i
have
learned
i
can
say
it
without
looking
at
the
book
cordelia
running
bird
shut
her
eyes
and
carefully
goeth
before
and
a
spirit
before
a
haughty
means
to
feel
the
pail
fell
downstairs
and
made
me
talk
dakota
so
i
had
to
come
to
bed
because
i
was
and
made
hannah
straight
tree
cross
just
like
they
all
would
not
be
hating
me
if
i
had
not
been
but
the
dormitory
girls
were
very
mean
to
walk
on
my
wet
floor
if
they
had
walked
heel
or
tiptoe
i
should
not
have
scolded
to
myself
about
the
ugly
issue
shoes
and
called
them
and
wished
they
had
to
lie
in
bed
but
i
did
not
wish
them
to
be
cripples
only
have
a
good
long
rest
till
i
was
through
scrubbing
but
hannah
was
mean
to
go
and
tell
i
can
find
no
verse
that
will
excuse
her
and
the
dormitory
girls
here
cordelia
running
bird
fell
to
pitying
herself
anew
i
shall
now
read
annie
best
verse
but
it
will
be
very
hard
to
mind
those
words
that
jesus
spoke
cordelia
running
bird
wound
the
ribbon
round
the
little
bible
tying
it
with
care
and
laid
the
book
close
by
her
on
the
bed
then
she
ate
her
dinner
with
a
hearty
relish
she
had
hardly
finished
when
the
door
from
the
front
hall
was
opened
and
the
young
white
mother
rosy
from
her
looked
into
the
dormitory
she
saw
the
little
bible
lying
near
cordelia
glanced
inquiringly
at
the
girl
and
then
smiled
and
nodded
to
receive
a
cheerful
smile
in
answer
jump
up
quickly
dear
and
dress
she
said
some
little
girls
are
going
up
the
river
to
the
store
and
one
of
the
girls
is
cordelia
running
bird
cordelia
started
out
of
bed
in
joyful
haste
are
you
ready
to
give
back
the
bible
asked
the
white
mother
coming
to
the
bed
yes
replied
cordelia
running
bird
handing
her
the
little
book
thank
you
very
much
it
made
me
think
of
annie
so
i
read
it
and
it
told
me
i
must
love
my
enemies
so
just
like
i
shall
do
it
now
i
am
very
glad
the
cross
thoughts
have
left
you
was
the
answer
now
put
on
your
plaid
dress
and
be
ready
in
ten
minutes
cordelia
flew
to
get
the
plaid
dress
from
the
closet
and
was
ready
and
downstairs
in
a
twinkling
the
little
girls
selected
for
the
drive
were
in
the
playroom
putting
on
their
hoods
and
coats
in
great
delight
cordelia
hurriedly
put
on
her
own
and
opening
her
cupboard
she
unlocked
a
doll
trunk
taking
out
a
tiny
purse
for
coins
whose
portly
sides
bespoke
some
wealth
within
she
looked
an
instant
at
the
blue
dress
and
the
silk
for
finding
to
her
great
relief
that
they
had
not
been
touched
she
locked
them
in
the
doll
trunk
put
the
little
key
into
the
purse
and
whisked
away
the
store
is
much
nicer
than
the
post
office
was
her
joyous
reflection
as
she
slipped
the
purse
into
her
pocket
on
her
way
outdoors
very
long
have
i
been
saving
this
last
part
of
all
the
money
that
i
earned
tending
baby
now
i
have
a
chance
to
spend
it
with
my
own
eyes
down
the
steep
hill
went
the
to
the
great
missouri
river
where
it
took
the
straight
smooth
road
on
the
ice
the
sewing
teacher
drove
the
horses
giving
them
free
rein
the
sat
beside
her
on
the
seat
and
cordelia
and
the
girls
were
snuggled
down
in
hay
upon
the
bottom
of
the
sled
with
comforters
for
the
little
log
store
was
but
two
miles
distant
and
the
party
were
not
long
in
reaching
it
it
stood
upon
a
steep
bluff
on
the
opposite
shore
the
white
man
who
kept
it
dealt
to
some
extent
in
indian
curiosities
of
which
the
two
teachers
were
in
quest
to
send
as
christmas
gifts
to
eastern
friends
we
wish
to
look
especially
at
moccasins
and
indian
dolls
said
the
to
the
trader
when
they
had
made
known
their
errand
illustration
we
wish
to
look
especially
at
moccasins
and
indian
dolls
said
the
teacher
i
got
some
moccasins
both
porcupined
and
beaded
but
no
indian
dolls
replied
the
trader
indian
dolls
are
growing
mighty
scarce
now
the
young
squaws
get
so
much
put
into
their
minds
to
do
only
the
understand
the
trick
of
making
dolls
i
am
disappointed
that
you
have
none
for
i
wished
to
send
one
to
my
little
niece
but
i
must
wait
and
try
to
get
one
elsewhere
while
the
two
teachers
were
examining
the
moccasins
cordelia
running
bird
and
the
children
were
absorbed
in
looking
at
the
china
dolls
and
other
articles
displayed
upon
the
shelves
and
hanging
from
a
wire
stretched
above
the
counter
i
was
telling
hannah
straight
tree
i
should
buy
a
big
doll
for
susie
and
a
red
silk
handkerchief
for
my
father
and
a
blue
silk
handkerchief
for
my
mother
and
should
hang
them
on
the
christmas
tree
said
cordelia
partly
to
herself
and
partly
to
the
little
girls
kee
i
would
not
hang
them
said
a
prudent
little
maid
of
ten
years
hannah
straight
tree
told
the
other
girls
and
they
are
very
yelous
that
is
not
the
word
but
i
forget
it
for
they
say
they
can
not
hang
their
people
anything
they
say
you
think
the
name
bird
is
very
stylish
and
you
wish
to
hear
it
called
so
often
at
the
christmas
tree
of
course
i
shall
not
hang
them
said
cordelia
firmly
and
i
shall
not
buy
a
doll
for
susie
for
my
father
always
buys
her
one
i
was
going
to
brag
about
her
having
two
she
added
candidly
and
i
shall
not
buy
the
silk
handkerchiefs
they
have
the
issue
cotton
ones
and
some
other
ones
that
my
father
bought
and
she
withdrew
her
eyes
from
the
display
of
cheap
and
gaudy
handkerchiefs
of
silk
material
suspended
from
the
wire
i
shall
buy
a
cake
pan
with
a
steeple
for
my
mother
and
a
hairbrush
for
my
father
for
his
hairs
stick
up
so
straight
and
stiff
and
i
shall
give
the
presents
very
still
at
camp
so
the
school
will
not
be
jealous
having
thus
subdued
her
vanity
cordelia
running
bird
shyly
bought
the
articles
she
had
selected
from
the
trader
boy
who
helped
his
father
in
the
store
she
also
bought
four
hair
ribbons
and
a
little
bag
of
candy
having
left
two
silver
quarters
she
was
considering
how
to
spend
them
when
her
eyes
alighted
on
some
little
brown
shoes
and
a
pair
of
stockings
matching
them
beneath
a
small
glass
little
shoes
and
stockings
she
exclaimed
forgetting
in
her
rapture
to
be
shy
before
the
trader
boy
the
small
girls
crowded
upon
tiptoe
at
the
peering
through
the
glass
sides
to
inspect
the
little
wonders
just
the
color
of
an
indian
observed
a
little
maid
of
seven
holding
up
her
slim
hand
to
compare
it
with
the
shoes
and
stockings
but
they
made
them
for
a
little
white
girl
they
are
like
the
ones
the
little
white
visitor
with
the
pink
dress
wore
last
summer
they
are
just
as
pretty
for
a
little
indian
girl
replied
cordelia
they
would
be
just
right
for
susie
with
a
longing
eye
but
susie
does
not
need
them
said
the
prudent
little
girl
she
has
a
black
shoes
and
stockings
in
your
cupboard
that
are
very
nice
but
she
could
have
two
pairs
these
would
be
so
pretty
with
the
red
dress
in
the
jack
frost
song
she
could
wear
the
black
ones
with
the
blue
dress
said
cordelia
seized
anew
with
her
besetting
sin
and
growing
helpless
in
its
grasp
she
asked
the
number
of
the
shoes
finding
it
the
same
that
susie
wore
then
she
asked
the
price
she
could
buy
the
shoes
and
stockings
for
a
dollar
and
a
half
one
dollar
more
than
i
have
got
she
said
in
feverish
regret
she
was
intently
silent
for
a
little
then
she
turned
and
running
quickly
to
the
drew
her
to
one
side
where
they
could
talk
unheard
the
indian
doll
my
grandmother
made
for
me
is
very
nice
and
new
for
i
have
kept
it
in
my
trunk
so
much
i
will
give
it
to
you
if
you
please
to
give
me
one
dollar
that
is
what
they
gave
my
grandmother
for
her
dolls
when
she
would
sell
them
at
the
agency
cordelia
said
in
eager
undertone
why
child
you
surely
can
not
wish
to
sell
your
indian
doll
that
has
a
beaded
buckskin
dress
just
like
the
one
your
grandmother
wore
when
she
was
your
age
said
the
in
surprise
no
thank
you
dear
you
wish
to
give
me
pleasure
but
i
can
not
accept
it
for
i
know
you
love
the
little
indian
grandmother
better
than
you
could
the
prettiest
white
doll
in
the
christmas
box
she
added
gratefully
it
is
very
and
i
do
not
now
care
for
it
replied
the
girl
with
a
clouded
face
i
wish
to
buy
the
little
brown
shoes
and
stockings
in
the
glass
box
pointing
to
the
i
have
only
fifty
cents
why
of
course
cordelia
if
you
really
wish
to
sell
it
was
the
response
the
shoes
and
stockings
are
for
susie
i
suppose
but
are
not
the
black
ones
nice
enough
cordelia
had
displayed
the
little
black
shoes
and
stockings
to
the
teachers
with
a
deal
of
pride
but
the
brown
ones
are
much
prettier
for
the
jack
frost
song
she
argued
pressingly
very
well
replied
the
teacher
opening
her
purse
and
handing
her
the
dollar
with
a
sorry
look
perhaps
however
we
would
better
see
the
little
things
before
you
buy
them
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
were
examined
by
the
teachers
and
were
thought
quite
satisfactory
for
the
price
cordelia
bought
them
breathlessly
and
hid
them
in
her
coat
pocket
to
insure
their
safety
but
the
in
the
early
moonlight
evening
was
less
joyous
than
had
been
the
journey
to
the
store
to
the
young
sioux
girl
the
seemed
to
jingle
harshly
and
the
gumbo
hills
whose
tops
were
bare
of
snow
seemed
frowning
blackly
from
across
the
river
cordelia
running
bird
passed
some
peppermints
to
the
children
which
awoke
a
burst
of
gratitude
we
little
girls
shall
always
choose
susie
in
the
games
said
one
yes
exclaimed
another
hannah
straight
tree
and
the
dormitory
girls
have
told
us
not
to
but
we
shall
ee
talk
lower
so
the
teacher
will
not
hear
you
said
cordelia
with
a
sudden
flutter
of
the
breath
you
must
choose
dolly
half
the
time
if
susie
plays
she
is
too
said
a
third
susie
has
two
pairs
of
pretty
shoes
and
two
nice
dresses
and
we
like
her
better
but
you
must
not
talk
that
way
before
the
larger
girls
cordelia
cautioned
in
an
undertone
doily
has
a
new
hair
ribbon
like
the
red
one
i
have
bought
for
susie
both
are
in
my
lap
and
i
have
bought
a
pink
one
for
lucinda
i
wish
to
do
them
good
hannah
straight
tree
too
you
must
tell
the
larger
girls
you
like
dolly
just
as
well
as
susie
if
they
wear
alike
ribbons
on
their
braids
it
will
be
nice
a
new
ribbon
can
not
dress
dolly
up
remarked
the
prudent
little
girl
the
points
of
her
hairs
will
look
like
susie
points
and
that
is
all
chapter
sunday
morning
there
was
wonder
in
the
school
to
see
cordelia
running
bird
in
the
heavy
government
shoes
that
had
been
lying
in
her
cupboard
since
the
distribution
of
the
clothing
early
in
the
fall
and
when
it
was
observed
that
she
had
dressed
for
and
had
not
changed
the
shoes
the
wonder
grew
to
pure
amazement
ee
what
ails
the
vainest
girl
in
south
dakota
she
will
now
be
wearing
issue
shoes
to
exclaimed
a
dormitory
girl
among
a
group
of
large
and
pupils
gathered
in
the
music
room
adjoining
the
playroom
in
attire
cordelia
sat
in
a
corner
with
her
eyes
upon
her
lesson
her
feet
were
planted
side
by
side
as
if
with
studied
care
just
like
she
is
very
scared
because
the
large
and
girls
do
not
speak
to
her
since
yesterday
she
is
not
sorry
only
scared
said
hannah
straight
tree
see
she
sticks
her
feet
out
very
far
so
we
will
see
the
shoes
and
think
she
is
not
vain
but
we
will
not
believe
her
she
has
found
the
dustpan
too
because
she
is
so
scared
of
me
she
bragged
so
much
she
made
me
cross
so
i
told
her
she
must
find
it
and
take
up
my
dirt
yesterday
she
minded
me
this
morning
she
will
be
more
scared
before
we
speak
to
her
remarked
the
bread
girl
ugly
issue
shoes
she
ought
to
wear
a
dragging
dress
to
hide
them
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
while
the
keen
black
eyes
of
the
entire
group
were
fixed
upon
cordelia
running
bird
feet
she
did
not
draw
them
back
nor
lift
her
eyes
but
suddenly
her
dusky
face
grew
scarlet
and
there
was
a
nervous
trembling
of
her
lips
that
moved
persistently
in
an
attempted
study
of
the
lesson
she
had
heard
the
words
as
the
girls
intended
she
should
they
were
speaking
in
dakota
without
fear
of
being
understood
by
the
white
mother
who
was
in
the
playroom
passing
pennies
for
the
missionary
plate
the
white
mother
heard
the
laugh
and
stepped
into
the
space
between
the
sliding
doors
which
were
ajar
she
saw
the
girls
resentment
at
a
glance
and
that
it
was
directed
at
cordelia
running
bird
she
was
troubled
but
could
not
combat
the
feeling
that
had
spread
throughout
the
school
to
mar
the
peace
and
quiet
of
the
sabbath
which
these
indian
girls
were
wont
to
keep
in
reverent
spirit
she
has
bought
another
pair
of
shoes
for
susie
stockings
too
not
black
ones
like
the
little
schoolgirls
have
to
wear
for
best
but
very
stylish
brown
ones
hannah
straight
tree
said
she
put
them
in
her
trunk
last
night
i
crept
upstairs
and
watched
her
for
the
children
said
she
had
them
in
her
pocket
the
large
and
girls
must
not
see
them
till
the
entertainment
but
the
little
girls
keep
saying
they
are
like
the
ones
the
little
white
visitor
that
wore
the
dress
that
was
pink
had
on
shoes
she
wants
to
hire
me
to
like
her
if
she
does
not
wish
to
have
dolly
in
the
jack
frost
song
with
susie
so
she
bought
new
hair
ribbons
at
the
store
for
dolly
and
lucinda
she
told
the
little
girls
because
she
knew
they
would
tell
me
but
dolly
and
lucinda
shall
not
wear
them
very
cotton
silk
of
course
the
ringing
of
the
bell
for
relieved
cordelia
running
bird
of
the
torment
she
was
undergoing
conversation
was
suspended
and
the
girls
put
on
their
hoods
and
marched
in
a
procession
to
the
guided
by
the
teachers
cordelia
had
a
trying
hour
in
the
girls
her
companions
in
the
white
mother
class
indulged
in
frequent
whispering
at
her
expense
and
kept
deep
silence
when
she
tried
to
lead
the
class
as
she
was
wont
in
reading
reference
verses
and
in
concert
recitation
of
the
memory
verses
and
the
golden
text
thus
it
happened
that
she
read
a
reference
verse
alone
in
faltering
accents
with
the
eyes
of
all
the
class
upon
her
the
words
of
the
lord
jesus
how
he
said
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
she
gives
a
nickel
every
sunday
so
she
minds
the
verse
and
gets
the
red
dress
very
cheap
hannah
straight
tree
whispered
from
the
seat
behind
the
white
mother
heard
the
whisper
but
the
words
were
in
dakota
so
she
failed
to
understand
she
saw
cordelia
running
bird
shrink
and
color
and
her
face
grow
very
grave
seeing
this
the
class
ceased
whispering
but
the
white
mother
faithful
teachings
went
unheeded
and
she
saw
the
lesson
was
a
failure
in
fact
the
whole
room
was
in
sad
disorder
from
the
opening
to
the
close
of
and
all
three
teachers
were
perplexed
and
disappointed
by
the
strange
behavior
of
their
usually
attentive
pupils
how
unfortunate
that
the
race
mood
has
attacked
the
school
when
christmas
is
approaching
and
we
wish
the
girls
to
do
their
best
and
be
their
happiest
said
the
white
mother
lingering
for
a
minute
in
the
schoolroom
after
the
dismissal
cordelia
seems
about
the
only
one
except
the
little
girls
who
is
out
of
sorts
yet
she
is
the
one
they
are
all
against
the
older
girls
all
seem
displeased
at
her
the
large
girls
worried
me
with
loud
and
constant
whispering
and
inattention
to
the
lesson
was
the
sorrowful
report
there
were
so
many
with
the
superintendent
class
combined
with
mine
i
found
it
quite
impossible
to
keep
good
order
as
you
probably
observed
the
superintendent
was
not
present
he
had
started
for
the
distant
railroad
station
two
days
previously
to
get
the
christmas
boxes
i
have
never
had
the
slightest
trouble
with
both
classes
heretofore
but
they
seemed
to
throw
off
all
restraint
and
i
was
simply
in
despair
added
the
young
teacher
with
a
strained
expression
in
her
voice
they
whispered
in
dakota
and
their
meaning
was
a
mystery
but
i
heard
cordelia
running
bird
name
and
hannah
straight
tree
very
often
also
susie
dolly
and
lucinda
there
was
some
trouble
in
the
hall
yesterday
which
made
cordelia
running
bird
moody
for
a
time
but
she
recovered
her
in
the
afternoon
and
seems
to
be
behaving
nicely
now
although
much
hurt
by
the
treatment
which
she
is
receiving
from
the
girls
the
white
mother
said
the
children
were
excited
also
said
the
teacher
who
had
taught
the
infant
class
they
whispered
much
in
english
and
i
gathered
from
their
talk
that
the
unusual
wardrobe
which
cordelia
is
preparing
for
her
little
sister
to
appear
in
during
her
christmas
visit
has
to
do
with
the
disturbance
i
was
forced
to
hear
about
the
red
dress
and
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
and
the
blue
dress
and
the
black
shoes
and
stockings
till
i
knew
not
what
to
do
it
seems
that
hannah
is
vexed
about
the
little
things
and
the
other
girls
are
sympathizing
with
her
and
they
seem
to
have
some
grievance
of
their
own
besides
that
explains
it
said
the
white
mother
perhaps
it
was
unwise
to
let
cordelia
have
the
red
cashmere
for
the
little
dress
but
she
is
paying
for
it
by
contributing
a
portion
of
her
money
to
the
missionary
fund
her
patience
with
the
baby
who
was
very
fretful
was
quite
wonderful
she
cheerfully
devoted
all
her
playtime
for
a
month
to
baby
while
i
gave
attention
to
the
little
children
and
i
thought
it
but
a
just
reward
to
let
her
have
the
little
dress
especially
as
it
was
in
her
mission
box
her
father
had
not
brought
the
blue
dress
then
but
dear
me
she
has
added
brown
shoes
and
stockings
which
i
did
in
the
least
expect
the
children
in
their
bedtime
talk
had
told
the
white
mother
of
cordelia
running
bird
purchase
at
the
store
and
later
in
the
evening
the
second
teacher
had
informed
her
of
the
barter
of
the
indian
doll
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
must
be
laid
to
my
account
whatever
can
be
done
exclaimed
the
in
dismay
nothing
said
the
white
mother
firmly
i
wish
cordelia
was
less
extravagant
and
we
will
be
careful
to
restrain
her
after
this
but
indian
girls
must
learn
as
well
as
white
girls
to
respect
the
right
of
property
the
girls
have
been
allowed
much
freedom
in
the
spending
of
what
money
they
could
call
their
own
but
it
has
mostly
gone
for
hair
ribbons
and
candy
and
there
has
been
no
trouble
before
i
hope
the
feeling
will
subside
however
in
a
day
or
two
so
many
christmas
pleasures
are
in
prospect
that
the
girls
will
surely
have
no
room
for
strife
and
envy
in
their
hearts
here
the
teachers
hastened
to
the
mission
building
to
discharge
the
duties
that
devolved
upon
them
after
just
before
monday
afternoon
a
flock
of
girls
were
gathered
at
the
stile
in
front
watching
with
intensity
a
solitary
little
figure
moving
slowly
on
a
far
side
of
the
pasture
near
the
barbed
wire
fence
again
there
walks
cordelia
running
bird
very
far
away
said
hannah
straight
tree
she
has
walked
alone
two
afternoons
she
must
be
thinking
very
hard
she
is
going
on
the
mourner
walk
observed
the
girl
who
kept
the
playroom
when
an
indian
walks
alone
so
far
and
very
slow
that
means
they
are
too
sad
she
can
not
be
happy
for
the
large
girls
only
me
and
the
girls
do
not
talk
to
her
then
too
of
course
she
thinks
of
annie
it
was
just
one
year
ago
this
monday
that
they
took
her
to
the
agency
the
large
girls
did
not
wash
because
there
was
a
funeral
and
cordelia
running
bird
was
so
proud
because
the
girls
all
cried
said
hannah
now
i
wish
we
had
not
cried
kee
you
must
not
be
so
mean
as
that
exclaimed
the
largest
girl
in
shocked
surprise
of
course
we
cried
for
annie
she
was
very
kind
to
everyone
not
cross
like
us
she
was
a
very
little
cross
sometimes
because
she
was
an
indian
she
tried
much
harder
than
cordelia
running
bird
i
am
glad
i
sang
sweet
by
and
by
when
she
was
so
afraid
said
emma
two
bears
the
girls
were
silent
for
a
little
stirred
by
memories
of
the
schoolmate
who
had
passed
into
the
life
beyond
meantime
the
solitary
girl
in
the
snowy
pasture
continued
her
walk
i
can
wish
i
had
not
told
cordelia
running
bird
that
i
would
not
sleep
with
anyone
but
her
said
hannah
i
am
glad
she
is
not
in
the
middle
dormitory
now
they
put
her
in
our
dormitory
so
that
she
can
go
and
tell
the
teachers
if
a
little
girl
is
sick
or
cries
remarked
the
prudent
little
girl
who
had
arrived
upon
the
scene
with
several
other
children
the
teachers
say
she
wakes
up
easy
and
is
braver
in
the
dark
than
any
other
girl
ee
cordelia
running
bird
is
a
dress
pattern
for
the
other
girls
i
mean
a
pattern
hannah
cried
cordelia
is
the
bravest
and
she
has
a
white
memory
so
she
has
the
longest
piece
cordelia
is
polite
she
keeps
her
clothes
so
clean
and
does
not
tear
them
so
the
missionary
ladies
send
her
prettier
things
for
the
teachers
write
she
is
so
nice
the
visitors
always
talk
about
cordelia
running
bird
very
lots
they
do
not
think
the
girls
are
listening
but
they
are
they
should
not
listen
that
is
stealing
talk
the
white
mother
says
replied
the
prudent
little
girl
we
like
cordelia
running
bird
for
she
does
not
scold
us
little
girls
and
tell
us
we
are
in
the
way
as
you
do
was
the
bold
defense
we
shall
choose
susie
in
the
games
if
the
little
girls
choose
susie
the
large
and
girls
can
pull
their
hairs
when
they
are
combing
them
was
the
appalling
threat
from
hannah
straight
tree
if
they
tell
the
teachers
we
can
say
their
hairs
were
snarly
and
we
could
not
help
it
ee
we
shall
not
pull
the
little
girls
hairs
and
tell
a
lie
said
emma
two
bears
rallying
her
honest
principles
we
can
treat
cordelia
running
bird
cross
because
she
called
us
and
is
very
vain
so
we
should
punish
her
but
we
will
not
be
wicked
i
did
not
say
we
shall
i
said
we
can
retracted
hannah
in
confusion
the
girls
were
very
mean
to
walk
where
she
was
scrubbing
said
the
playroom
girl
who
knew
from
sad
experience
what
trials
must
have
been
it
makes
me
very
cross
because
the
little
girls
will
not
stay
out
or
sit
still
on
the
benches
when
i
scrub
the
playroom
and
they
do
not
make
big
tracks
if
they
do
walk
you
can
speak
to
her
because
she
could
not
call
you
for
the
white
mother
lets
you
always
wear
the
mission
shoes
said
hannah
straight
tree
growing
bold
again
because
i
have
an
onion
no
a
bunion
on
my
foot
the
issue
shoes
would
make
it
worse
just
like
there
is
no
girl
in
school
that
does
not
hate
to
have
the
horrid
tracks
on
her
wet
floor
i
hate
them
some
confessed
a
middle
dormitory
girl
i
too
admitted
a
south
dormitory
girl
i
threw
a
few
drops
of
scrub
water
on
a
girl
that
walked
i
told
a
girl
her
tracks
were
so
big
just
like
she
had
on
snowshoes
said
a
north
dormitory
girl
relentingly
of
course
i
made
the
very
biggest
kind
of
tracks
on
cordelia
running
bird
wet
floor
said
the
largest
girl
but
if
we
walk
tiptoe
all
the
other
girls
will
laugh
and
say
how
she
nips
along
she
tries
to
walk
so
nice
just
like
the
teachers
and
if
we
are
walking
on
our
heels
they
say
awkward
hear
her
tramp
just
like
a
steer
but
it
is
not
kind
to
walk
the
race
mood
was
upon
the
wane
and
hannah
straight
tree
was
fast
losing
influence
i
would
not
have
cared
so
much
about
the
blue
dress
and
the
black
shoes
and
stockings
but
she
bought
the
red
dress
and
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
when
her
little
sister
does
not
need
them
hannah
argued
in
an
injured
tone
she
did
not
buy
them
with
your
money
said
the
playroom
girl
you
would
not
have
taken
care
of
a
cross
baby
four
weeks
and
missed
a
plum
picnic
and
not
played
a
leap
to
earn
pretty
things
for
dolly
you
are
much
too
lazy
now
i
shall
not
stay
another
minute
springing
from
the
stile
in
deep
chagrin
you
all
can
like
cordelia
running
bird
if
you
want
to
but
i
shall
not
like
her
hannah
straight
tree
ran
into
the
house
and
those
remaining
turned
again
to
watch
cordelia
she
had
reached
a
sloping
bluff
down
which
the
fence
extended
to
the
flats
beside
the
river
she
stood
a
moment
on
the
edge
then
wrapped
her
clothes
about
her
and
sat
down
on
the
crust
presently
she
disappeared
she
has
slid
down
hill
observed
the
playroom
girl
she
must
be
going
to
the
river
she
should
not
it
will
soon
be
dark
and
she
is
all
alone
said
emma
two
bears
in
a
tone
betraying
some
anxiety
chapter
vi
cordelia
running
bid
held
her
clothes
about
her
with
one
hand
steering
with
her
feet
and
reached
the
flats
in
safety
she
arose
and
stood
still
and
looked
toward
the
river
to
a
space
of
open
water
on
the
near
side
of
a
sandbar
half
way
over
she
took
a
few
steps
forward
rather
slowly
then
her
pace
quickened
more
and
more
till
she
was
running
breathlessly
as
if
in
fear
of
losing
her
resolve
to
carry
out
some
plan
she
was
intent
upon
in
rushing
through
a
hollow
lined
with
willow
trees
she
slipped
and
almost
lost
her
footing
and
in
struggling
to
regain
it
she
released
her
hold
upon
a
gingham
bag
which
she
had
hid
beneath
her
coat
and
dropped
it
on
the
ground
she
picked
it
up
and
hung
it
by
the
on
her
arm
but
with
this
interruption
of
her
headlong
course
there
came
a
corresponding
halt
of
purpose
so
she
turned
aside
and
walked
a
few
yards
down
the
hollow
where
she
found
a
log
on
which
to
seat
herself
presently
she
murmured
in
the
passive
monotone
of
a
despairing
indian
girl
just
like
i
have
to
stop
and
think
before
i
do
it
if
i
drown
the
blue
dress
and
the
black
shoes
and
stockings
and
the
red
dress
and
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
i
can
write
to
hannah
straight
tree
for
she
will
not
let
me
speak
to
her
you
see
i
truly
am
not
vain
for
i
have
put
the
christmas
clothes
for
susie
in
my
workbag
and
a
stone
so
it
would
sink
and
i
have
drowned
them
in
the
airhole
in
the
middle
of
the
river
but
again
that
would
be
bragging
was
her
puzzled
afterthought
just
like
jesus
is
not
helping
me
one
bit
for
very
fast
i
went
and
bought
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
after
i
had
prayed
to
stop
being
vain
and
the
teachers
looked
so
sorry
and
i
was
ashamed
to
tell
the
white
mother
everything
i
say
and
do
is
vain
and
bragging
and
i
can
not
think
hard
enough
to
help
it
my
tongue
bragged
about
dolly
and
lucinda
hair
ribbons
to
the
little
girls
and
my
feet
bragged
about
the
issue
shoes
i
stuck
them
out
so
far
and
when
the
girls
made
fun
of
me
i
did
not
pull
the
shoes
back
for
i
wanted
them
to
think
i
was
not
scared
but
sorry
i
was
truly
trying
to
try
hard
but
i
was
trying
the
wrong
way
now
my
pencil
will
be
bragging
if
it
tells
hannah
straight
tree
i
have
drowned
the
things
cordelia
sat
in
troubled
thought
while
the
pink
and
golden
colors
of
the
sunset
faded
from
the
sky
above
the
bluffs
and
the
wind
sighed
through
the
hollow
the
white
mother
says
it
is
not
right
to
even
waste
a
pin
and
many
nice
things
that
have
cost
much
money
would
be
wasted
if
i
drowned
them
i
shall
look
at
them
and
think
again
what
i
can
do
she
drew
the
contents
from
the
bag
and
spread
them
on
her
lap
first
she
gave
attention
to
the
little
blue
dress
she
had
helped
to
make
at
the
expense
of
many
play
hours
illustration
she
drew
the
contents
from
her
bag
and
spread
them
on
her
lap
emma
two
bears
made
the
waist
so
nice
and
said
she
would
not
take
one
thing
for
pay
but
i
made
her
take
a
shell
necklace
that
was
very
pretty
but
i
did
not
care
for
it
myself
it
was
so
emma
is
so
generous
i
wish
i
could
be
generous
if
i
should
give
the
blue
dress
to
dolly
and
the
black
shoes
and
stockings
just
like
i
should
be
some
generous
what
if
i
should
truly
do
it
with
a
sudden
interest
in
her
tone
she
would
look
as
pretty
as
the
little
schoolgirls
then
and
she
could
motion
jack
frost
and
hannah
and
the
others
could
not
say
susie
did
not
need
the
red
dress
and
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
i
am
sure
jessie
turning
heart
will
help
me
make
the
red
dress
if
i
bring
the
playroom
wood
for
her
till
we
change
work
next
month
she
hates
to
bring
wood
for
her
foot
gets
cold
and
then
the
sore
bunch
pinches
her
much
worse
she
is
very
fast
and
stylish
making
dresses
and
she
and
she
says
she
is
not
cross
at
me
she
said
one
time
she
liked
to
sew
so
much
just
like
she
would
be
getting
up
and
sewing
in
her
sleep
so
i
shall
ask
her
to
trade
work
but
hannah
straight
tree
says
she
hates
light
blue
for
it
makes
a
indian
look
much
blacker
and
she
hates
one
tuck
and
there
would
have
to
be
one
for
the
blue
dress
is
too
long
for
dolly
and
it
smuts
some
too
and
is
not
soft
and
fine
hannah
would
not
want
it
she
would
say
susie
looked
much
nicer
in
the
red
dress
and
dolly
should
not
motion
jack
frost
in
the
blue
one
cordelia
put
the
blue
dress
and
the
black
shoes
and
stockings
back
into
the
bag
and
spread
the
red
cashmere
across
her
lap
and
smoothed
it
lovingly
it
feels
so
soft
i
like
to
rub
it
just
the
color
of
the
one
rose
on
the
white
mother
window
bush
she
held
it
up
luxuriating
in
its
warm
red
glow
and
pretty
and
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
too
i
shall
put
them
on
the
clean
snow
and
look
at
them
she
spread
the
things
on
the
hard
white
crust
and
viewed
them
with
increasing
admiration
suddenly
she
caught
them
up
and
hid
them
in
her
apron
for
the
sight
of
them
was
far
too
tempting
then
she
locked
her
hands
together
in
her
lap
and
sat
so
still
a
dared
to
leave
his
hole
beneath
the
log
and
frisk
about
her
feet
the
baby
was
so
cross
i
could
not
play
one
bit
the
whole
four
weeks
she
said
at
length
in
supplicating
tones
just
like
i
earned
the
dress
so
hard
i
thought
i
did
not
care
much
for
the
indian
doll
but
my
grandmother
can
not
make
another
for
she
now
has
in
her
hands
the
doctor
says
it
is
and
i
sold
the
indian
doll
to
get
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
dolly
has
a
round
face
and
her
eyes
are
pretty
susie
has
a
thin
face
and
she
is
a
very
little
so
she
needs
a
prettier
dress
to
look
as
nice
as
dolly
but
lucinda
can
not
come
to
school
if
dolly
can
not
and
she
feels
so
sad
if
dolly
father
saw
her
looking
very
pretty
in
a
red
dress
and
a
brown
shoes
and
stockings
just
like
he
would
feel
so
happier
he
would
let
her
come
to
school
then
lucinda
would
be
glad
and
she
would
learn
the
neat
way
and
they
would
grow
dolly
more
the
verse
i
read
yesterday
was
a
king
daughters
verse
helen
marked
it
annie
too
what
if
annie
should
be
looking
down
from
up
there
pointing
to
a
newly
glimmering
star
and
speaking
just
like
this
cordelia
these
words
i
tell
you
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
i
would
give
the
red
dress
and
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
to
the
little
girl
named
dolly
straight
tree
cordelia
looked
another
minute
at
the
star
of
course
annie
can
not
speak
those
words
up
there
but
she
would
like
to
have
me
do
it
and
my
father
and
my
mother
would
not
care
for
i
should
tell
them
just
like
annie
thought
i
ought
to
and
they
always
let
me
do
a
thing
i
want
to
anyhow
if
an
indian
likes
another
indian
very
much
he
will
give
him
a
big
present
my
father
told
an
indian
man
one
time
am
your
friend
so
i
shall
give
you
a
pony
and
he
did
and
the
indian
man
told
my
father
am
your
friend
so
i
shall
give
you
a
steer
and
a
white
man
laughed
and
said
it
was
a
good
trade
but
the
indians
did
not
laugh
they
said
my
father
and
the
other
indian
were
very
generous
now
i
have
found
the
right
way
and
it
makes
me
very
happier
and
i
shall
not
change
my
thoughts
in
firm
relief
i
shall
do
this
kind
till
dolly
and
lucinda
come
i
shall
not
say
one
word
to
any
girl
or
even
tell
the
white
mother
then
susie
best
things
i
shall
give
to
hannah
straight

in
a
way
that
will
surprise
her
tokee
there
rings
the
bell
till
supper
and
i
am
down
here
and
it
is

cordelia
hastily
replaced
the
best
things
in
the
bag
and
scampered
home
chapter
vii
cordelia
running
bird
carried
out
her
plan
of
asking
jessie
turning
heart
the
playroom
girl
to
help
her
make
the
red
dress
and
the
latter
willingly
agreed
to
trade
work
and
escape
bringing
in
the
wood
to
the
torture
of
her
lame
foot
cordelia
found
that
she
had
undertaken
no
light
task
for
there
were
violent
snowstorms
in
the
next
two
weeks
and
an
enormous
quantity
of
wood
was
swallowed
by
the
great
stove
in
the
playroom
which
must
needs
be
kept
from
long
before
dawn
until
bedtime
to
dispel
the
freezing
atmosphere
within
owing
to
the
influence
of
the
playroom
girl
the
large
and
girls
in
general
ceased
to
be
intensely
hostile
to
cordelia
but
they
did
not
break
the
seal
of
silence
so
she
could
not
ask
help
from
among
them
the
small
girls
showed
their
friendship
for
cordelia
now
and
then
by
marching
in
a
line
behind
her
from
the
laden
with
what
fuel
they
could
bring
or
even
going
down
the
path
the
older
girls
had
broken
to
the
flats
for
willow
fagots
which
they
tied
upon
their
backs
and
brought
to
her
for
kindling
hannah
straight
tree
tried
cordelia
resolution
to
do
good
to
her
by
stealthy
persecutions
that
escaped
the
notice
of
the
teachers
who
remarked
to
one
another
in
relief
that
hannah
and
the
other
girls
appeared
in
better
humor
toward
cordelia
and
the
fatter
had
regained
her
cheerful
spirits
hannah
took
her
station
in
the
little
outside
hall
one
blustering
afternoon
watching
through
the
side
window
till
cordelia
climbed
the
porch
steps
loaded
to
her
chin
with
wood
then
hannah
braced
her
back
against
the
outside
door
cordelia
spared
one
hand
with
difficulty
tugging
at
the
door
with
garments
all
in
vain
she
dropped
her
wood
to
use
both
hands
the
door
would
sometimes
stick
when
lightly
closed
and
thinking
this
to
be
the
case
she
threw
her
weight
against
it
in
a
forcible
attempt
to
burst
it
open
hannah
jumped
away
and
darted
through
the
inside
door
in
silent
glee
cordelia
fell
full
length
into
the
hall
and
struck
her
head
against
the
inner
threshold
she
lay
in
a
dazed
condition
for
a
little
then
aroused
herself
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
hannah
peering
through
the
window
of
the
inside
door
she
vanished
instantly
but
the
expression
of
her
face
had
told
cordelia
where
the
mischief
lay
she
will
not
let
me
like
her
thought
cordelia
struggling
to
her
feet
with
aching
head
and
blinking
back
the
tears
just
like
i
shall
have
to
hate
her
just
a
little
while
i
do
her
good
she
turned
and
saw
to
her
surprise
that
emma
two
bears
who
had
come
behind
her
to
the
porch
was
gathering
up
her
wood
emma
often
helped
to
fill
the
in
the
music
room
as
an
especial
friend
of
hers
attended
to
that
work
and
cordelia
feared
her
wood
was
being
boldly
captured
for
that
purpose
she
was
about
to
cry
out
sharply
but
restrained
herself
and
fell
back
silently
while
emma
passed
into
the
house
cordelia
followed
her
and
saw
with
sinking
heart
that
emma
took
a
straight
track
through
the
playroom
for
the
music
room
but
on
the
threshold
of
the
room
she
whirled
about
and
walking
to
the
playroom
dropped
the
wood
in
thank
you
very
much
exclaimed
cordelia
in
sign
language
on
her
fingers
etiquette
forbade
her
to
employ
her
tongue
in
the
expression
of
her
gratitude
seeing
that
the
girls
had
placed
a
ban
on
it
a
curious
contortion
of
the
alphabet
was
used
among
the
indian
girls
when
pride
forbade
the
use
of
speech
you
need
not
thank
me
i
am
only
punishing
hannah
straight
tree
emma
answered
likewise
with
her
fingers
this
exchange
of
compliments
was
read
without
scruple
by
the
many
pairs
of
eyes
including
hannah
that
were
watching
the
affair
emma
two
bears
talks
to
her
now
we
can
plan
with
her
for
that
is
not
a
speaking
game
observed
a
girl
who
had
been
a
comrade
of
cordelia
heretofore
she
will
not
have
time
to
crack
the
whip
said
hannah
she
is
going
to
the
south
dormitory
where
she
sits
her
whole
playtime
helping
sew
the
red
dress
for
susie
so
she
can
look
nicer
than
the
other
little
home
sisters
and
the
little
schoolgirls
you
are
very
and
you
try
hard
to
spite
cordelia
running
bird
said
the
recent
comrade
you
can
talk
that
way
because
you
have
no
little
sister
grumbled
hannah
cordelia
passed
upstairs
with
quick
steps
just
like
the
large
and
girls
only
hannah
straight
tree
will
again
be
speaking
to
me
pretty
soon
she
said
to
jessie
turning
heart
who
sat
beside
a
sunny
window
in
the
south
dormitory
sewing
briskly
on
the
little
red
waist
they
can
not
speak
to
you
till
christmas
day
because
they
all
said
they
would
not
jessie
answered
then
if
you
and
say
you
do
not
wish
them
to
be
cripples
any
more
and
that
you
will
stop
talking
vain
they
will
again
speak
to
you
and
they
will
walk
heel
or
tiptoe
on
your
floor
i
shall
write
an
in
dakota
on
three
papers
christmas
morning
and
pin
them
on
a
side
of
the
three
dormitories
but
you
must
not
tell
because
i
do
not
wish
to
brag
what
i
shall
do
cordelia
said
in
strictest
confidence
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
you
had
but
one
shoes
and
stockings
and
best
dress
for
susie
but
you
can
not
help
it
now
the
playroom
girl
replied
two
best
dresses
and
two
shoes
and
stockings
look
too
many
when
the
other
little
home
sisters
have
not
one
best
thing
cordelia
running
bird
was
quite
strongly
tempted
to
confide
still
further
in
the
friendly
playroom
girl
who
had
sustained
her
through
the
trying
tempest
of
events
but
she
resisted
and
began
to
hem
the
little
skirt
in
silence
ee
how
short
you
have
it
jessie
noticed
suddenly
you
must
think
susie
is
to
grow
the
other
way
before
she
wears
it
cordelia
only
answer
was
a
noncommittal
smile
which
jessie
failed
to
understand
this
thought
however
suddenly
impressed
cordelia
now
it
is
too
short
for
susie
and
the
hem
is
not
one
bit
too
wide
so
i
could
not
let
it
down
what
if
hannah
straight
tree
is
so
cross
she
will
not
let
dolly
wear
it
and
there
is
no
other
little
home
sister
just
the
size
of
dolly
that
could
wear
it
and
is
coming
christmas
just
like
hannah
will
not
take
it
and
will
keep
on
hating
me
forever
and
ever
so
i
can
not
do
her
good
whether
this
foreboding
was
fulfilled
or
otherwise
will
be
explained
in
hannah
letter
to
the
king
daughter
in
the
far
east
who
had
sent
the
little
bible
and
the
loving
message
to
the
king
daughter
in
the
far
west
helen
now
i
shall
write
you
a
letter
for
cordelia
running
bird
can
not
for
she
says
it
would
be
bragging
it
is
all
about
christmas
and
our
big
and
little
sisters
cordelia
big
sister
is
now
in
heaven
and
cordelia
wrote
to
you
from
annie
my
big
sister
is
now
in
the
first
reader
but
she
can
not
help
it
for
my
mother
died
and
so
lucinda
had
to
stay
at
home
and
keep
dolly
and
that
is
my
little
sister
and
it
was
about
susie
that
is
cordelia
little
sister
that
i
got
so
mean
and
jealous
for
she
had
a
nice
christmas
things
two
kinds
and
dolly
would
not
have
one
kind
and
she
would
look
so
horrid
so
i
called
cordelia
running
bird
proud
vain
cross
mean
and
i
talked
about
her
so
the
girls
got
cross
at
her
and
i
made
her
push
a
pail
of
scrub
water
downstairs
so
she
talked
dakota
and
had
to
lie
in
bed
and
could
not
the
blue
dress
for
it
smutted
so
the
silk
would
be
too
dirty
but
she
the
red
dress
and
she
sold
her
indian
doll
and
it
was
her
when
she
was
cordelia
age
so
she
bought
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
and
cordelia
read
the
king
daughters
verses
your
enemies
and
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
so
she
put
the
red
dress
and
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
and
two
hair
ribbons
in
a
box
and
jessie
turning
heart
tied
a
blue
scarf
round
my
eyes
so
tight
i
could
not
see
and
led
me
to
the
chicken
house
and
i
put
my
hand
on
the
box
and
jessie
pulled
off
the
scarf
and
i
uncovered
the
box
and
found
the
things
and
cordelia
running
bird
had
pinned
a
piece
of
paper
on
the
red
dress
and
these
words
were
written
on
it
hannah
straight
tree
i
am
your
friend
so
i
shall
give
you
these
best
christmas
things
for
dolly
and
will
you
please
take
the
hair
ribbons
for
they
are
not
very
cotton
silk
and
i
was
very
and
said
i
would
not
take
them
i
had
been
so
mean
but
cordelia
running
bird
said
i
must
for
she
had
made
the
red
dress
too
short
for
susie
so
if
i
did
not
it
would
be
wasted
so
i
told
her
i
would
take
it
if
she
would
excuse
my
meanness
but
i
should
not
take
the
brown
shoes
and
stockings
only
just
the
black
ones
but
she
begged
so
hard
just
like
i
had
to
and
cordelia
and
i
scrubbed
dolly
very
hard
in
a
tub
for
lucinda
has
not
learned
the
neat
way
and
she
did
not
cry
only
laughed
and
the
white
mother
found
some
very
little
underclothes
for
her
and
we
curled
her
hair
with
a
slate
pencil
and
she
wore
the
best
things
and
looked
so
pretty
and
the
brown
shoes
were
a
little
bit
too
large
but
they
did
not
show
and
dolly
motioned
jack
frost
very
cunning
and
they
looked
at
dolly
more
than
susie
but
cordelia
running
bird
did
not
care
and
my
father
was
so
happier
he
laughed
and
laughed
when
dolly
nipped
her
nose
and
pinched
her
toes
just
right
and
when
the
song
stopped
he
slapped
his
knees
and
cried
very
loud
he
was
so
glad
about
dolly
and
after
the
christmas
tree
my
father
told
the
teachers
and
emma
two
bears
was
interpreter
school
is
a
good
place
for
it
makes
the
indian
children
very
smart
and
you
treat
the
indian
visitors
very
kind
so
i
shall
let
dolly
stay
and
then
lucinda
will
stay
too
very
fast
lucinda
stopped
being
sad
for
she
thought
before
my
father
would
not
let
dolly
stay
till
she
was
ten
birthdays
and
lucinda
loves
her
so
she
would
not
stay
without
her
and
the
doll
they
hung
me
on
the
christmas
tree
was
bigger
than
cordelia
running
bird
and
its
hairs
and
clothes
were
prettier
so
i
told
cordelia
am
your
friend
and
i
shall
give
you
my
doll
and
she
did
not
want
to
take
it
but
i
made
her
so
she
said
am
your
friend
and
i
shall
give
you
my
doll
but
it
is
not
so
nice
as
yours
and
cordelia
running
bird
and
i
now
walk
together
all
the
time
and
again
i
shall
never
be
mean
to
her
and
they
did
not
choose
susie
quite
so
much
as
dolly
in
the
games
but
cordelia
says
that
makes
her
glad
and
it
was
because
she
read
the
king
daughters
verses
now
i
shall
put
an
end
to
this
too
long
letter
many
days
have
i
been
writing
it
and
the
girls
said
just
like
i
was
writing
a
book
and
cordelia
sends
her
love
from
your
unknown
american
indian
friend
hannah
straight
thee
cordelia
running
bird
nearly
drowned
both
kinds
of
christmas
clothes
and
then
she
thought
to
give
the
best
kind
to
dolly
and
susie
did
not
care
because
she
had
to
wear
the
blue
dress
and
it
smutted
so
her
hands
and
face
got
dirty
and
the
black
shoes
and
stockings
she
was
just
as
happier
and
the
teacher
saved
indian
doll
and
gave
it
back
to
her
because
she
knew
she
loved
it
very
hard
and
cordelia
was
so
glad
she
hugged
it
very
tight
again
cordelia
wrote
on
earth
toward
men
i
do
not
wish
the
dormitory
girls
were
cripples
and
i
will
stop
talking
vain
and
will
always
wear
the
issue
shoes
every
day
and
will
they
please
excuse
me
and
they
did
and
now
they
walk
heel
or
tiptoe
on
cordelia
wet
floor
lucinda
will
now
learn
the
neat
way
and
they
will
grow
dolly
more
for
she
came
to
school
so
short
and
again
i
say
it
was
the
king
daughters
verses
and
i
do
not
like
to
think
hard
but
i
shall
try
to
learn
them
too
and
we
did
not
shut
our
eyes
at
susie
when
she
motioned
jack
frost
as
we
meant
to
just
for
spite
and
the
girls
all
said
cordelia
was
so
generous
she
said
she
nearly
got
vain
again
so
i
shall
stop
this
time
