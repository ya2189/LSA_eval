miss
betty
the
chinese
cook
flourished
his
rolling
pin
with
one
hand
and
swung
his
apron
viciously
with
the
other
as
he
held
open
the
screen
door
and
swept
out
some
imaginary
flies
lee
chang
cook
for
the
bunk
house
in
the
oil
fields
could
do
several
things
at
one
time
as
he
had
frequently
proved
the
girl
who
was
watching
a
wiry
little
bay
horse
contentedly
crop
grass
that
grew
in
straggling
whisps
about
the
fence
posts
looked
up
and
showed
an
even
row
of
white
teeth
as
she
smiled
i
do
think
we
going
to
stay
for
dinner
she
said
half
regretfully
i
know
your
apple
tarts
lee
chang
they
are
delicious
the
fat
chinaman
closed
the
screen
door
and
went
on
with
his
pastry
making
from
time
to
time
as
he
passed
from
the
table
to
the
oven
he
glanced
out
betty
gordon
still
stood
watching
the
horse
that
bob
no
come
inquired
lee
chang
poking
his
head
out
of
the
door
again
fast
developing
into
a
good
american
his
natural
trait
of
curiosity
gave
him
the
advantage
of
acquiring
information
blandly
and
with
ease
betty
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
the
oklahoma
sun
was
pitiless
far
up
the
road
that
ran
straight
away
from
the
bunk
house
a
faint
cloud
of
dust
was
rising
he
coming
now
said
the
girl
confidently
lee
chang
grunted
and
returned
to
his
work
satisfied
that
whatever
betty
was
waiting
for
would
soon
be
at
hand
bake
tart
that
boy
goes
away
the
chinaman
muttered
to
himself
waddling
hastily
to
the
oven
opening
it
and
closing
the
door
again
with
a
satisfied
sniff
the
cloud
of
dust
whirled
more
madly
rose
higher
out
from
the
center
of
it
finally
emerged
a
white
horse
that
galloped
with
amazing
awkwardness
and
incredible
speed
astride
him
sat
a
slim
tanned
youth
with
eyes
as
blue
as
betty
gordon
were
dark
got
something
for
you
he
called
waving
his
arm
in
the
motion
of
catch
if
you
can
oh
do
cried
betty
eagerly
what
is
it
bob
be
careful
or
break
it
bob
henderson
reined
in
his
mount
and
slipped
to
the
ground
the
white
horse
contentedly
went
to
munching
dry
blades
of
dusty
grass
bob
i
do
believe
you
been
silly
said
betty
trying
to
speak
severely
and
failing
completely
because
her
dimple
would
deepen
distractingly
you
know
i
told
you
not
to
do
it
how
do
you
know
what
i
done
demanded
bob
placing
a
square
package
in
the
girl
hands
do
scold
till
you
know
what
scolding
about
betty
busy
with
the
cord
and
paper
paused
oh
bob
she
beamed
her
vivid
face
glowing
with
a
new
thought
what
do
you
think
i
had
a
letter
yesterday
from
bobby
littell
and
she
going
to
boarding
school
and
bob
so
am
i
uncle
dick
says
so
and
bob
yes
smiled
bob
thinking
how
the
girl
face
changed
as
she
talked
go
on
betty
well
louise
is
going
too
and
they
think
libbie
will
come
down
from
vermont
dear
old
libbie
i
wonder
if
she
is
as
incurably
romantic
as
ever
betty
fingers
had
worked
mechanically
while
she
spoke
and
now
she
had
her
parcel
undone
why
bob
henderson
she
gasped
as
she
drew
out
a
handsome
white
box
tied
with
pale
blue
ribbons
and
encased
in
waxed
paper
i
hope
they
not
stale
said
bob
diffidently
betty
slit
the
waxed
paper
and
took
off
the
box
lid
revealing
a
perfectly
packed
box
of
expensive
chocolates
they
beautiful
she
declared
but
i
never
dreamed
you
would
send
east
for
simply
because
i
happened
to
say
i
was
hungry
for
good
candy
um
um
taste
one
quick
bob
bob
took
a
caramel
and
pronounced
it
not
half
bad
uncle
dick
gone
somewhere
with
dave
thorne
announced
betty
biting
into
another
candy
he
did
know
when
he
would
get
back
and
supposed
to
ride
to
the
watterby
farm
for
lunch
it
must
be
after
eleven
now
miss
betty
lee
chang
voice
was
persuasive
miss
betty
that
apple
tart
he
all
baked
done
now
apple
tart
shouted
bob
show
me
lee
chang
i
rather
have
a
corner
of
your
pie
than
all
the
candy
in
new
york
him
for
miss
betty
said
the
chinaman
gravely
but
you
do
care
if
i
give
bob
some
do
you
returned
betty
coaxingly
see
lee
chang
bob
gave
me
these
you
take
some
and
eat
the
tart
on
our
way
home
lee
chang
wish
was
fulfilled
when
he
placed
the
flaky
tart
in
betty
hands
and
he
took
a
candy
or
two
which
he
privately
considered
rather
poor
stuff
and
watched
the
girl
no
longer
from
now
on
till
dinner
time
lee
chang
whole
attention
would
be
concentrated
on
the
preparation
of
an
excellent
dinner
for
the
men
who
worked
that
section
of
the
oil
fields
i
do
believe
i
can
ride
and
eat
this
after
all
decided
betty
let
sit
down
on
the
grass
and
finish
it
clover
has
finished
her
lunch
either
the
little
bay
horse
and
the
tall
shambling
white
were
amiably
straying
up
and
down
the
narrow
borders
of
the
road
never
getting
very
far
away
you
have
said
a
single
word
about
my
going
to
boarding
school
bob
betty
said
dropping
down
comfortably
on
the
dusty
grass
and
breaking
the
tart
across
into
two
nearly
even
pieces
there
take
your
pie
do
you
think
i
have
fun
with
the
littell
girls
you
have
a
lark
but
i
not
so
sure
about
the
teachers
declared
bob
enthusiastically
an
odd
little
smile
quivering
on
his
lips
with
you
and
bobby
littell
about
i
doubt
if
the
school
knows
a
dull
moment
bobby
is
so
funny
dimpled
betty
she
writes
that
if
libbie
comes
her
aunt
expects
bobby
to
look
after
her
wait
a
minute
and
i
read
you
that
part
betty
took
a
letter
from
the
pocket
of
her
blouse
listen
aunt
elizabeth
has
written
mother
that
she
hopes
i
will
keep
an
eye
on
libbie
now
betty
can
you
honestly
see
me
trailing
around
after
that
girl
who
sees
a
romance
in
every
bush
and
book
and
who
cries
when
any
one
plays
violin
music
i
look
after
her
all
right
she
have
to
study
french
instead
of
poetry
if
i
to
be
her
friend
and
guide
but
of
course
bobby
does
really
love
libbie
very
dearly
said
betty
folding
up
the
letter
and
returning
it
to
her
pocket
she
would
hurt
her
for
worlds
you
be
a
much
better
guardian
for
libbie
if
she
needs
one
pronounced
bob
with
unexpected
shrewdness
bobby
has
much
tact
and
she
makes
libbie
mad
you
could
probably
control
her
better
with
less
words
well
i
never
gasped
betty
gazing
at
bob
with
new
respect
i
never
knew
you
thought
anything
about
it
did
until
just
now
responded
bob
cheerfully
so
uncle
dick
is
willing
to
let
you
go
is
he
when
do
you
start
you
do
mind
do
you
bob
countered
betty
puzzled
you
sound
so
kind
of
of
funny
do
mean
to
said
bob
laconically
having
finished
his
tart
he
lay
back
and
rested
his
head
in
his
hands
in
true
masculine
contentment
i
like
that
blue
thing
you
got
on
he
commented
lazily
did
i
ever
see
it
before
certainly
not
betty
informed
him
i
been
waiting
for
you
to
notice
it
it
wash
silk
bob
and
your
aunt
faith
said
i
could
have
it
if
i
could
do
anything
with
it
she
had
it
in
a
trunk
for
years
and
years
i
do
see
how
you
and
aunt
faith
could
wear
the
same
clothes
she
so
much
taller
than
you
are
said
bob
obviously
trying
to
put
two
and
two
together
in
his
mind
but
it
looks
fine
on
you
betty
betty
smiled
at
him
compassionately
oh
bob
you
so
funny
she
sighed
i
made
this
blouse
all
myself
that
is
she
corrected
watterby
helped
me
cut
it
out
and
she
sewed
the
sleeves
in
after
i
had
basted
them
in
wrong
twice
but
i
did
everything
else
there
was
a
scrap
of
goods
left
over
either
i
put
it
on
because
i
wanted
you
to
see
me
in
it
she
was
worth
seeing
bob
acknowledged
to
himself
the
of
blue
and
white
checked
silk
slashed
at
the
throat
for
the
crisp
black
tie
and
the
gray
corduroy
riding
skirt
and
smart
tan
shoes
were
at
once
suitable
and
becoming
i
have
to
have
some
new
clothes
for
school
declared
betty
who
had
a
healthy
interest
in
this
topic
we
ca
wear
very
fussy
things
though
bobby
sent
me
the
catalogue
sailor
suits
for
every
day
and
a
cloth
frock
for
best
and
not
more
than
one
party
dress
i
asked
her
when
she
started
bob
confided
to
the
blank
eye
of
the
white
horse
now
turned
dully
toward
him
but
if
she
answered
me
i
did
hear
i
going
a
week
from
this
friday
announced
betty
hastily
that
will
give
me
a
week
in
washington
and
littell
has
asked
me
to
stay
with
them
i
must
write
to
bender
and
tell
her
the
news
she
has
been
so
anxious
for
me
to
go
to
school
again
oh
gee
betty
that
reminds
me
bob
sat
up
with
a
jerk
and
began
a
hasty
search
of
his
pockets
when
you
spoke
of
bender
that
reminded
me
of
laurel
grove
and
laurel
grove
reminded
me
of
glenside
and
that
of
course
made
me
think
of
the
guerins
here
is
and
the
boy
triumphantly
fished
out
a
small
letter
from
an
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
and
tossed
it
into
betty
lap
it
from
norma
guerin
betty
expressive
voice
betrayed
her
delight
why
i
have
heard
from
her
in
perfect
ages
i
wonder
what
she
has
to
say
open
it
and
see
advised
the
practical
bob
i
meant
to
give
you
the
letter
right
away
and
first
the
tart
and
then
the
blouse
drove
it
out
of
my
mind
i
lead
the
horses
and
you
can
read
as
we
walk
want
me
to
take
the
plate
back
to
lee
chang
he
dashed
back
to
the
bunk
house
returned
the
tin
and
rejoined
betty
who
was
slowly
slitting
the
envelope
of
her
letter
with
a
hairpin
she
had
tucked
her
candy
box
under
her
arm
and
bob
took
the
bridles
of
the
two
horses
mercy
what
was
that
betty
glanced
up
startled
as
a
wild
yell
sounded
over
on
their
right
there
was
a
chorus
of
shouts
the
same
wild
yell
repeated
and
then
sudden
and
without
warning
came
a
dense
and
heavy
rain
of
blackest
oil
oh
bob
bob
there
was
genuine
anguish
in
betty
wail
of
appeal
my
new
blouse
look
at
it
but
bob
had
no
time
to
look
at
anything
action
was
to
be
his
course
it
a
premature
blast
he
shouted
come
on
we
got
to
get
out
chapter
ii
norma
letter
this
was
not
betty
gordon
first
experience
with
an
oil
well
set
off
prematurely
and
while
she
was
naturally
excited
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
get
on
clover
shouted
bob
i
do
wish
you
ever
wear
a
hat
betty
laughed
a
little
as
she
scrambled
into
her
saddle
bob
mounting
his
own
horse
wore
no
hat
but
it
was
a
pet
grievance
of
his
that
betty
persistently
scorned
headgear
whether
riding
or
walking
gallop
cried
bob
shut
your
eyes
if
you
want
to
clover
will
follow
reuben
the
white
horse
set
off
his
awkward
lunge
carrying
him
over
the
ground
swiftly
and
the
little
bay
clover
cantered
obediently
after
him
oil
continued
to
rain
down
as
they
headed
toward
the
north
betty
closed
her
eyes
clutching
her
letter
and
candy
box
tightly
in
both
hands
and
letting
the
reins
lie
idle
on
her
horse
neck
clover
galloping
now
could
be
trusted
to
follow
the
leading
horse
getting
better
now
bob
shouted
back
turning
in
his
saddle
to
see
that
betty
was
safe
betty
dark
eyes
opened
and
she
shook
back
her
hair
making
a
little
face
at
the
taste
of
oil
in
her
mouth
she
slipped
norma
guerin
letter
into
her
pocket
glancing
down
at
her
blouse
as
she
did
so
i
a
perfect
sight
she
called
to
bob
dolorously
i
do
believe
i
can
ever
get
the
oil
spots
out
of
this
silk
sue
the
company
bob
cried
with
a
grin
do
let
clover
go
to
sleep
till
we
nearer
home
betty
the
girl
urged
the
little
bay
forward
with
a
whispered
word
of
encouragement
and
gradually
very
gradually
they
began
to
draw
out
of
the
rain
of
oil
betty
gordon
was
not
an
oklahoma
girl
though
she
rode
with
the
effortless
ease
of
a
westerner
she
was
an
orphan
of
new
england
stock
and
had
come
from
the
east
to
the
oil
fields
to
join
her
one
living
relative
a
beloved
uncle
whose
interest
in
oil
holdings
made
an
incessant
traveler
of
him
this
richard
gordon
uncle
dick
to
bob
henderson
as
well
as
to
betty
had
found
himself
unexpectedly
made
guardian
of
his
little
niece
at
a
time
when
it
was
impassible
for
him
to
establish
a
home
for
her
his
time
and
skill
pledged
to
the
oil
company
he
represented
gordon
had
solved
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
betty
by
sending
her
to
spend
the
summer
with
an
old
childhood
friend
of
his
a
peabody

year

fourteen
year
old
bob

life
at

a
drab
existence
at
the
county
poor
farm
became
the
champion
of
the

a
common
bond
of
friendship

thousand
dollars
uncle
dick
had
been
made
guardian
of
bob
at
his
own
and
the
aunts
request
so
bob
was
now
a
ward
with
betty
the
possession
of
money
though
it
meant
the
difference
between
poverty
and
debt
and
great
comfort
had
to
date
made
very
little
change
in
the
mode
of
living
of
miss
faith
and
miss
charity
saunders
or
of
their
nephew
this
morning
he
had
been
delayed
by
some
extra
work
on
the
farm
for
the
oil
company
did
not
take
possession
till
the
first
of
the
month
now
a
week
away
and
betty
had
ridden
to
the
oil
fields
ahead
of
him
she
divided
her
time
between
the
saunders
place
and
the
watterby
farm
where
she
and
bob
had
stayed
when
they
first
came
to
flame
city
whew
gasped
bob
as
they
finally
emerged
from
the
black
curtain
of
oil
of
all
the
messy
stuff
betty
you
look
as
though
an
oil
lamp
had
exploded
in
your
face
now
i
have
to
wash
my
hair
again
mourned
betty
you
better
come
to
grandma
watterby
and
get
tidied
up
bob
it
nearer
than
your
aunts
taking
this
road
and
they
always
have
the
stove
tank
full
of
hot
water
bob
took
this
advice
and
the
sympathetic
watterby
family
came
to
the
pair
assistance
with
copious
supplies
of
hot
water
soap
and
towels
and
liberal
handfuls
of
borax
for
the
water
was
very
hard
fortunately
betty
had
a
clean
blouse
and
skirt
at
hand
most
of
her
wardrobe
was
in
the
guest
room
at
the
saunders
farm
and
bob
borrowed
a
clean
shirt
from
will
watterby
in
which
the
boy
being
much
smaller
than
the
man
looked
a
little
absurd
i
clean
anyway
and
that
makes
me
feel
good
so
why
should
i
care
how
i
look
was
bob
defense
when
his
appearance
was
commented
on
i
so
hungry
announced
betty
coming
out
of
her
room
once
more
trim
and
neat
and
sniffing
the
delicious
odor
of
hot
waffles
i
wonder
if
i
could
pin
my
hair
up
in
a
towel
and
dry
it
after
lunch
of
course
you
may
said
will
watterby
warmly
did
you
fix
a
place
for
betty
grandma
what
a
silly
question
emma
reproved
old
grandma
watterby
severely
here
betty
you
sit
next
to
me
and
bob
can
have
place
he
gone
over
to
flame
city
with
a
bolt
he
wants
the
blacksmith
to
tinker
up
ki
the
indian
who
helped
with
the
farm
work
smiled
at
betty
but
said
nothing
more
than
the
single
howdy
which
was
his
stock
form
of
salutation
watterby
waffles
were
quite
as
good
as
they
smelled
and
she
apparently
had
mixed
an
inexhaustible
quantity
of
batter
every
one
ate
rapidly
and
in
comparative
silence
a
habit
to
which
bob
and
betty
were
by
now
quite
accustomed
when
gordon
was
present
he
insisted
on
a
little
conversation
but
his
presence
was
lacking
you
go
right
out
in
the
sun
and
dry
your
hair
betty
said
watterby
when
the
meal
was
over
no
i
do
need
any
help
with
the
dishes
grandma
and
me
we
going
over
to
town
in
the
car
this
afternoon
and
i
do
care
whether
i
do
the
dishes
till
i
come
back
or
not
this
for
watterby
was
a
great
step
forward
before
the
purchase
of
the
automobile
bought
with
a
legacy
inherited
by
grandma
watterby
dishes
and
housework
had
been
the
sum
total
of
will
existence
now
that
she
could
drive
the
car
and
get
away
from
her
kitchen
sink
at
will
she
seemed
another
woman
betty
voiced
something
of
this
to
bob
as
she
unfastened
the
towel
and
let
her
heavy
dark
hair
fall
over
her
shoulders
she
was
sitting
on
the
back
porch
where
the
afternoon
sun
shone
unobstructed
yes
i
guess
automobiles
are
a
good
thing
admitted
bob
absently
i
want
aunt
faith
to
get
one
a
runabout
would
be
handy
for
them
one
like
doctor
guerin
remember
betty
my
goodness
i
have
read
norma
letter
said
betty
hastily
i
left
it
in
my
other
blouse
wait
a
minute
and
i
get
it
she
dashed
into
the
house
and
was
back
again
in
a
moment
the
letter
bob
had
handed
her
just
before
the
shower
of
oil
in
her
hand
bob
in
his
favorite
attitude
of
lying
on
his
back
and
staring
at
the
sky
was
startled
by
an
exclamation
before
betty
had
finished
the
first
page
of
the
closely
written
missive
what
the
matter
he
demanded
sitting
up
anybody
sick
oh
bob
such
fun
betty
eyes
danced
with
pleasure
what
do
you
think
norma
and
alice
guerin
are
going
to
shadyside
well
i
willing
to
jump
with
joy
but
could
you
tell
me
what
shadyside
is
and
where
said
bob
humbly
why
do
the
guerin
girls
want
to
go
there
i
forgot
you
did
know
apologized
betty
shadyside
is
the
boarding
school
bob
that
the
name
of
the
station
too
it
five
hours
ride
from
washington
let
see
there
bobby
and
louise
littell
and
libbie
and
now
norma
and
alice
five
girls
i
know
already
i
guess
i
wo
be
homesick
or
lonely
but
as
she
said
it
she
glanced
uncertainly
at
bob
that
young
man
snickered
turned
it
into
a
cough
and
that
failing
essayed
to
whistle
bob
you
act
too
funny
for
anything
this
time
betty
glance
was
not
one
of
approval
what
does
ail
you
nothing
nothing
at
all
betsey
bob
assured
her
i
my
usual
charming
self
are
norma
and
alice
going
to
washington
first
no
i
wish
they
were
answered
betty
taking
up
the
letter
again
bob
i
afraid
they
having
a
hard
time
with
money
matters
you
know
guerin
is
so
he
never
collects
of
the
bills
he
sends
out
and
any
one
can
get
his
services
free
if
they
tell
him
a
hard
luck
story
norma
writes
that
she
and
alice
have
always
wanted
to
go
to
shadyside
because
their
mother
graduated
from
there
when
it
was
only
a
day
school
guerin
people
lived
around
there
somewhere
and
last
year
you
know
norma
went
to
an
awfully
ordinary
school
good
enough
i
suppose
but
not
very
thorough
she
could
prepare
for
college
there
well
could
we
fix
it
some
way
for
them
asked
bob
interestedly
i
do
anything
in
the
world
for
doctor
guerin
did
he
row
me
that
time
he
found
us
out
in
the
fields
at
two
in
the
morning
you
think
up
some
way
to
make
him
accept
some
money
betty
doctor
hal
guerin
and
his
wife
and
daughters
had
been
good
friends
to
bob
and
betty
in
the
bramble
farm
days
the
doctor
with
a
large
country
practice
that
brought
him
more
affection
and
esteem
than
ready
cash
had
managed
to
look
after
the
boy
and
girl
more
or
less
effectively
and
norma
his
daughter
had
supplied
bob
with
orders
from
her
school
friends
for
little
carved
pendants
that
he
made
with
no
better
tools
than
an
old
knife
this
money
had
been
the
first
bob
had
ever
earned
and
had
given
him
his
first
taste
of
independence
i
do
think
you
could
make
doctor
guerin
take
money
even
as
a
loan
said
betty
slowly
in
answer
to
bob
proposal
norma
like
it
if
she
thought
her
letter
had
suggested
such
a
thing
what
makes
it
hard
for
them
i
think
is
that
guerin
expected
to
have
quite
a
fortune
some
day
her
mother
was
really
wealthy
and
she
was
an
only
child
i
do
know
where
the
money
went
but
i
do
know
the
guerins
never
had
any
of
it
bob
jumped
to
his
feet
as
she
finished
the
sentence
here
uncle
dick
he
cried
did
you
see
the
new
well
come
in
sir
chapter
iii
surprising
bob
betty
shook
back
her
hair
and
rose
to
kiss
the
gentleman
who
put
an
arm
affectionately
about
her
i
heard
about
that
blast
he
said
and
smiled
lee
chang
was
much
worried
when
i
went
in
to
dinner
his
one
consolation
was
that
you
had
eaten
the
tart
before
the
oil
began
to
fall
we
were
all
right
only
of
course
it
rather
daubed
us
up
said
bob
betty
had
to
wash
her
hair
my
hair
nothing
declared
betty
scornfully
but
my
blouse
that
i
worked
on
for
two
days
you
ought
to
see
it
uncle
dick
grandma
watterby
thinks
maybe
she
can
get
the
oil
out
but
she
says
the
color
may
come
out
too
gordon
sat
down
on
the
step
and
took
off
his
hat
you
a
clear
claim
for
damages
betty
he
assured
his
niece
gravely
to
save
time
i
willing
to
make
good
what
does
a
new
blouse
cost
this
was
exactly
new
explained
betty
fairly
aunt
faith
had
the
material
in
her
trunk
for
years
but
it
was
the
first
thing
i
ever
made
and
i
was
so
proud
of
it
well
we
see
that
you
have
something
to
take
its
place
promised
her
uncle
drawing
her
down
beside
him
i
have
some
news
for
you
betsey
when
you
go
east
next
week
i
going
too
that
is
as
far
as
chicago
from
there
i
take
a
little
run
up
into
canada
but
you
said
you
spend
christmas
with
us
argued
betty
oh
christmas
is
months
off
returned
gordon
comfortably
i
expect
to
be
back
in
the
states
long
before
the
holidays
and
bob
aunts
have
finally
made
up
their
minds
where
they
want
to
spend
the
winter
aunt
faith
has
commissioned
me
to
buy
two
tickets
for
southern
california
but
there
bob
betty
gazed
anxiously
at
her
uncle
what
bob
going
to
do
without
any
one
at
all
uncle
dick
gordon
looked
at
bob
and
an
unwilling
grin
turned
the
corners
of
the
boy
mouth
that
the
way
he
been
acting
all
day
scolded
betty
what
ails
him
i
think
it
silly
to
sit
there
and
smile
when
there
nothing
to
smile
about
i
suspect
bob
does
take
kindly
to
secrets
returned
her
uncle
suppose
you
up
bob
and
when
the
atmosphere
is
clear
we
can
have
a
little
talk
all
right
said
bob
with
manifest
relief
i
kept
quiet
only
because
i
wanted
to
be
sure
i
was
going
sir
betty
littell
wrote
me
about
a
military
academy
in
the
east
and
put
me
in
touch
with
several
boys
who
attend
it
uncle
dick
thinks
it
is
just
the
school
for
me
and
i
going
timothy
derby
is
one
of
the
boys
he
a
son
of
the
man
i
worked
for
in
washington
how
splendid
with
characteristic
enthusiasm
betty
forgot
her
momentary
displeasure
at
bob
method
of
keeping
a
secret
when
are
you
going
bob
where
is
the
school
that
the
best
part
said
bob
boyishly
it
the
salsette
military
academy
betty
and
it
right
across
the
lake
from
the
shadyside
school
all
five
of
the
boys
littell
told
me
of
are
friends
of
the
littell
girls
so
you
see
it
is
going
to
be
great
fun
all
around
i
never
knew
of
anything
so
nice
declared
betty
never
so
you
knew
when
i
told
you
about
shadyside
that
you
were
going
to
be
so
near
bob
nodded
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
he
said
with
mock
seriousness
at
which
betty
made
a
little
face
you
have
much
time
to
get
ready
gordon
warned
them
the
aunts
will
leave
wednesday
and
our
train
pulls
out
at
ten
on
friday
morning
of
course
you
will
do
your
shopping
in
washington
and
be
guided
by
the
advice
of
and
littell
i
wish
i
could
go
to
washington
with
you
but
that
is
impossible
now
you
must
write
me
faithfully
both
of
you
though
i
suppose
we
have
to
expect
the
same
delay
between
letters
that
we
experienced
before
most
of
my
time
will
be
spent
on
a
farm
thirty
miles
from
a
railroad
if
you
get
into
any
difficulties
go
to
the
littells
and
for
little
troubles
help
each
other
gordon
went
on
to
say
that
while
bob
and
betty
were
independent
to
a
greater
degree
than
most
boys
and
girls
of
their
age
the
same
force
of
circumstances
that
made
this
possible
also
gave
them
a
heavier
responsibility
he
explained
that
each
was
to
have
an
allowance
and
asked
that
each
keep
a
cash
account
to
be
submitted
to
him
on
his
return
from
canada
not
he
said
to
serve
as
a
check
upon
extravagant
or
foolish
expenditures
but
that
he
might
be
better
able
to
advise
them
and
to
point
out
avoidable
mistakes
after
supper
that
night
he
drew
the
boy
aside
for
further
discussion
i
really
leaving
betty
in
your
charge
he
said
and
bob
stood
fully
two
inches
taller
not
that
i
think
she
will
get
into
any
serious
trouble
but
there
no
telling
what
a
bevy
of
girls
will
think
up
and
you
know
what
betty
is
when
once
started
she
can
not
be
stopped
i
rely
on
you
to
keep
her
confidence
and
hold
her
back
if
she
seems
inclined
to
act
rashly
the
littells
are
splendid
people
but
they
will
be
five
hours
distance
away
while
you
will
be
across
the
lake
i
put
my
trust
in
you
bob
bob
silently
resolved
to
be
worthy
betty
had
been
his
first
friend
and
to
her
he
gave
all
the
loyalty
and
starved
affection
of
a
lonely
boy
nature
when
gordon
came
into
his
life
and
especially
when
he
was
made
his
legal
guardian
bob
experienced
the
novel
sensation
of
having
some
one
interested
in
his
future
though
the
various
older
men
he
had
met
were
more
than
willing
to
help
him
gordon
was
the
only
one
to
succeed
in
winning
over
bob
almost
fanatical
pride
and
the
lad
who
admired
respected
and
loved
him
would
have
done
anything
in
the
world
for
him
the
next
few
days
were
extremely
busy
ones
for
bob
the
aunts
and
betty
miss
hope
and
miss
charity
were
so
excited
at
the
prospect
of
a
journey
that
they
completely
lost
their
faculty
for
planning
and
most
of
the
work
fell
on
bob
and
betty
luckily
there
was
little
packing
to
be
done
for
the
few
bits
of
old
furniture
were
to
be
sold
for
what
they
would
bring
and
the
keepsakes
that
neither
miss
hope
nor
her
sister
could
bring
themselves
to
part
with
were
stored
in
several
old
trunks
to
be
housed
in
the
watterby
attic
betty
child
her
uncle
voice
broke
in
upon
betty
orderly
packing
one
afternoon
i
know
you
going
to
be
disappointed
but
we
cry
over
what
ca
be
helped
i
had
a
wire
and
must
leave
for
chicago
wednesday
morning
you
and
bob
will
have
to
make
the
washington
trip
alone
i
knew
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
mourned
betty
a
tear
dropping
on
the
yellowed
silk
shawl
she
was
neatly
folding
oh
dear
uncle
dick
i
did
want
you
to
go
with
us
part
of
the
way
better
luck
next
time
replied
gordon
there
no
use
grumbling
over
what
you
ca
change
this
was
his
philosophy
and
he
followed
it
consistently
bob
and
betty
though
keenly
disappointed
they
were
not
to
have
his
companionship
tried
to
accept
the
situation
as
cheerfully
as
he
did
the
packing
was
hastened
and
soon
the
old
farmhouse
was
stripped
and
dismantled
the
trunks
stored
in
the
watterby
attic
the
furniture
carried
off
to
the
homes
of
those
who
bought
it
and
the
key
delivered
to
dave
thorne
the
section
foreman
who
would
deliver
it
to
the
superintendent
the
hospitable
watterbys
had
insisted
that
the
travelers
should
all
stay
with
them
until
the
time
for
their
several
departures
and
bob
and
betty
had
a
last
glorious
ride
on
clover
and
the
ungainly
white
horse
while
the
aunts
rested
and
put
the
final
touches
to
their
preparations
for
their
journey
the
next
morning
all
was
bustle
and
hurry
for
the
aunts
were
to
start
on
their
trip
and
gordon
must
be
off
to
chicago
miss
hope
insisted
on
being
taken
to
the
station
an
hour
before
their
train
was
due
and
when
a
puff
of
steam
up
the
track
announced
the
actual
approach
of
the
train
the
two
old
ladies
trembled
with
nervousness
and
excitement
gordon
guided
them
up
the
steps
of
the
car
after
a
tearful
farewell
to
bob
and
betty
and
saw
that
they
were
settled
in
the
right
sections
he
spoke
to
the
conductor
on
the
way
out
and
tipped
the
porter
and
maid
liberally
to
look
after
the
travelers
comfort
chapter
iv
more
they
feel
better
presently
he
remarked
rejoining
bob
and
betty
on
the
platform
i
know
the
boarding
house
they
chosen
is
fine
in
every
way
and
they
going
to
have
a
delightful
winter
the
train
started
slowly
and
the
black
silk
gloves
of
the
aunts
waved
dolorously
from
the
window
they
were
embarked
on
their
adventure
do
look
so
solemn
betty
teased
her
uncle
if
i
not
mistaken
that
the
smoke
from
my
train
i
do
want
any
one
to
weep
over
my
departure
i
could
but
i
wo
betty
assured
him
bravely
you
wo
get
sick
or
anything
will
you
uncle
dick
and
you
write
to
me
every
week
like
a
clock
he
promised
her
there
goes
the
agent
with
my
bags
this
is
the
local
all
right
bob
remember
what
i
asked
of
you
gordon
wrung
bob
hand
and
smiled
down
into
the
blue
eyes
lifted
so
fervently
to
his
you
my
boy
too
he
said
clearly
do
forget
lad
if
you
need
me
then
he
swept
betty
into
his
arms
be
a
good
girl
sweetheart
he
murmured
kissing
her
they
watched
him
climb
up
the
steps
of
the
snorting
smoky
local
saw
his
bags
tossed
into
the
baggage
car
and
then
with
a
shrill
grinding
of
wheels
the
training
resumed
its
way
as
long
as
they
could
see
the
tall
figure
in
the
gray
suit
stood
on
the
platform
and
waved
a
white
handkerchief
to
them
oh
bob
do
let
me
cry
begged
betty
in
a
sudden
panic
everybody
watching
us
let
go
somewhere
quick
all
right
we
will
promised
bob
we
take
the
car
to
doctor
morrison
hop
in
betsey
and
dry
your
eyes
you
going
traveling
yourself
day
after
i
was
really
crying
explained
betty
as
she
settled
herself
in
the
shabby
car
that
had
belonged
to
her
uncle
he
had
sold
it
to
the
town
physician
but
does
it
give
you
a
lonesome
feeling
to
be
the
one
that
left
i
hate
to
say
anyway
bob
experience
with
motors
was
rather
limited
and
what
slight
knowledge
he
possessed
had
been
gained
in
a
few
lessons
taken
while
riding
with
gordon
however
the
boy
was
sure
that
he
could
drive
the
car
the
brief
distance
to
the
doctor
house
and
betty
shared
his
confidence
from
the
morrison
house
it
was
only
a
short
walk
to
the
watterby
farm
where
they
were
to
stay
until
they
left
for
the
east
betty
forgot
to
cry
as
bob
started
the
car
so
suddenly
that
it
shot
forward
like
a
live
thing
he
jammed
on
the
brake
and
brought
it
to
a
standstill
so
abruptly
that
betty
came
very
near
to
pitching
through
the
windshield
could
you
do
it
er
more
gently
she
hinted
delicately
hold
fast
and
i
try
grinned
bob
as
a
chauffeur
i
be
a
good
iceman
the
second
time
he
managed
better
and
the
battered
little
car
moved
off
with
less
disturbing
results
in
a
very
few
minutes
they
had
reached
doctor
morrison
garage
the
doctor
urged
bob
and
betty
strongly
to
stay
to
supper
with
him
and
promised
beaten
biscuit
and
honey
but
although
they
knew
the
skill
of
his
old
southern
cook
very
well
they
had
promised
grandma
watterby
to
be
there
for
supper
and
such
a
promise
could
not
be
disregarded
well
anyway
said
betty
soothingly
as
they
walked
on
toward
the
watterby
farm
when
we
ride
clover
and
reuben
up
to
the
fields
we
have
to
worry
about
how
to
make
them
go
no
that
so
agreed
bob
but
betty
i
hate
to
think
of
giving
up
reuben
he
is
much
to
look
at
but
he
has
been
a
mighty
good
horse
i
feel
worse
declared
betty
if
we
had
to
sell
them
to
strangers
we
would
know
how
they
would
be
treated
then
now
we
are
sure
they
will
be
cared
for
and
petted
and
they
wo
miss
us
reuben
and
clover
gordon
had
said
were
to
be
disposed
of
as
betty
and
bob
chose
the
horses
were
theirs
to
give
away
or
sell
as
they
preferred
bob
had
instantly
decided
to
give
his
mount
to
dave
thorne
the
section
foreman
who
had
shown
him
many
kindnesses
and
who
was
delighted
to
get
a
trained
saddle
horse
horses
were
very
scarce
in
that
section
of
the
country
and
gordon
had
gone
to
considerable
trouble
to
get
these
betty
had
elected
to
give
clover
to
the
new
superintendent
daughter
the
girl
who
was
to
move
with
her
parents
into
the
old
saunders
farmhouse
betty
had
never
seen
her
but
knew
she
was
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
and
eager
to
learn
to
ride
the
day
before
they
were
to
start
for
washington
bob
and
betty
rode
the
horses
up
to
the
oil
fields
and
gave
them
into
the
charge
of
dave
thorne
the
superintendent
was
already
on
the
ground
but
his
family
and
furniture
were
not
due
for
a
week
clover
and
reuben
bore
the
parting
better
than
their
young
mistress
and
master
and
betty
was
glad
when
all
the
had
been
said
and
they
stepped
into
the
watterby
car
which
watterby
had
driven
up
for
them
the
fields
were
about
eight
miles
from
her
house
you
be
happier
when
once
you
on
the
train
betty
said
good
watterby
glancing
swiftly
at
betty
clouded
face
this
going
around
saying
to
people
and
things
is
enough
to
break
anybody
up
now
me
and
mother
wo
weep
a
tear
over
you
you
see
glad
you
going
to
school
to
have
a
good
time
with
all
those
young
folks
now
what
that
chinaman
want
lee
chang
came
running
from
the
bunk
house
waving
something
tied
in
white
paper
apple
tart
miss
betty
he
called
imploringly
velly
nice
apple
tart
maybe
the
cook
at
that
school
no
make
good
tarts
betty
took
the
package
and
thanked
him
warmly
and
they
drove
on
people
are
so
good
to
me
choked
the
girl
i
never
knew
i
had
so
many
friends
well
that
nothing
to
cry
over
advised
bob
philosophically
you
ought
to
be
glad
do
i
get
a
crumb
of
the
tart
betsey
he
spoke
with
a
purpose
and
was
rewarded
by
seeing
betty
own
sunny
smile
come
out
you
always
do
she
told
him
but
wait
till
we
get
home
i
want
ki
to
have
a
piece
too
ki
it
developed
when
they
reached
the
watterby
farm
had
been
busy
with
farewell
plans
of
his
own
for
you
he
announced
gravely
to
bob
handing
him
an
immense
hunting
knife
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
car
for
you
he
informed
betty
with
equal
gravity
presenting
her
a
little
silver
nugget
they
both
thanked
him
repeatedly
and
he
stalked
off
carrying
his
piece
of
the
apple
tart
and
apparently
assured
of
their
sincerity
though
what
he
expects
me
to
do
with
a
hunting
knife
is
more
than
i
can
guess
laughed
bob
chapter
v
a
regular
be
sure
you
send
me
a
postal
from
washington
i
never
knew
anybody
from
there
before
said
grandma
watterby
earnestly
and
do
get
off
the
train
unless
you
know
how
long
it
going
to
stop
advised
will
watterby
do
you
think
you
ate
enough
breakfast
his
wife
asked
anxiously
bob
and
betty
were
waiting
for
the
eastern
limited
and
the
watterby
family
who
had
brought
them
to
the
station
were
waiting
too
the
limited
stopped
only
on
signal
and
this
was
no
every
day
occurrence
we
be
all
right
said
bob
earnestly
you
can
look
for
a
postal
from
chicago
first
grandma
then
came
the
usual
hurried
the
kisses
and
handshakes
and
the
repeated
promises
to
write
soon
then
bob
and
betty
found
themselves
in
the
sleeper
waving
frantically
to
the
little
group
on
the
platform
as
the
limited
slowly
got
under
way
and
that
the
last
of
flame
city
for
some
time
at
least
observed
bob
betty
who
had
made
excellent
use
of
lessons
learned
in
her
few
previous
long
journeys
took
off
her
hat
and
gloves
and
placed
them
in
a
paper
bag
which
bob
put
in
the
rack
for
her
i
did
want
a
new
hat
so
much
she
sighed
looking
rather
enviously
at
the
woman
across
the
aisle
who
wore
a
smart
fall
hat
that
was
unmistakably
new
but
flame
city
depends
on
mail
order
hats
and
i
thought
it
safer
to
wait
till
i
could
see
what
people
are
really
wearing
you
look
all
right
said
bob
loyally
what
that
around
that
neck
fur
why
i
so
hot
i
can
hardly
breathe
it
mink
betty
informed
him
with
superiority
is
it
beautiful
i
wanted
a
set
but
uncle
dick
said
mink
was
too
old
for
me
he
did
say
though
that
i
can
have
a
neckpiece
made
from
that
fox
skin
ki
gave
me
do
see
why
you
want
to
tie
yourself
up
like
an
eskimo
grumbled
bob
well
we
seem
to
be
headed
toward
the
door
marked
do
we
betsey
they
exchanged
a
smile
of
understanding
bob
was
passionately
eager
for
what
he
called
regular
schooling
that
is
the
steady
discipline
of
fixed
lessons
the
companionship
of
boys
of
his
own
age
and
the
give
and
take
of
the
average
large
busy
school
normal
life
of
any
kind
was
out
of
the
question
in
the
poorhouse
where
he
had
spent
the
first
ten
years
of
his
life
and
after
that
he
had
not
seen
the
inside
of
a
schoolroom
he
had
read
whatever
books
he
could
pick
up
while
at
bramble
farm
and
in
the
knowledge
of
current
events
was
remarkably
thanks
to
his
steady
assimilation
of
newspapers
and
magazines
since
leaving
the
peabody
roof
but
he
feared
and
with
some
foundation
that
he
might
be
found
deplorably
lacking
in
the
most
rudimentary
branches
betty
of
course
had
gone
to
school
regularly
until
her
death
in
the
year
that
had
elapsed
she
had
thought
little
of
lessons
and
though
she
did
not
realize
it
she
had
lost
to
a
great
extent
the
power
of
application
systematic
study
of
any
kind
might
easily
prove
a
hardship
for
the
active
betty
still
she
was
eager
to
study
again
perhaps
prepare
for
college
more
than
anything
else
she
craved
girl
friends
let
go
in
for
lunch
at
the
first
call
suggested
betty
presently
i
did
eat
much
breakfast
and
i
do
believe
you
did
either
i
swallowed
a
cup
of
boiling
coffee
admitted
bob
but
that
all
i
remember
so
i
ready
when
you
are
seated
at
a
table
well
toward
the
center
of
the
car
betty
attention
was
attracted
to
a
girl
who
sat
facing
her
she
was
not
a
pretty
girl
she
looked
discontented
and
peevish
and
the
manner
in
which
she
addressed
the
waiter
indicated
that
she
felt
under
no
obligation
to
disguise
her
feelings
take
that
back
she
ordered
pointing
a
beautifully
manicured
hand
at
a
dish
just
placed
before
her
if
you
ca
bring
me
a
poached
egg
that
is
raw
do
bother
at
all
and
i
hope
you
do
intend
to
call
this
cream
bob
glanced
swiftly
over
at
the
table
the
girl
consciously
tucked
back
a
lock
of
stringy
hair
displaying
the
flash
of
several
diamonds
sweet
disposition
has
she
muttered
bob
under
his
breath
i
like
to
see
her
board
just
one
week
with
mr
peabody
do
she
hear
you
protested
betty
i
wonder
if
she
is
all
alone
what
lovely
clothes
she
has
and
did
you
see
her
rings
well
she
need
if
she
going
to
snap
at
everybody
said
bob
severely
diamonds
help
out
a
cross
tongue
when
a
poor
waiter
is
thinking
of
his
tip
the
girl
was
still
finding
fault
with
her
food
when
betty
and
bob
rose
to
leave
the
car
and
when
they
passed
her
table
she
stared
at
them
with
languid
insolence
half
closing
her
narrow
hazel
eyes
wow
she
bored
completely
snickered
bob
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
i
do
believe
she
a
day
older
than
you
are
betty
and
she
is
dressed
up
like
a
little
christmas
tree
i
think
her
clothes
are
wonderful
said
betty
i
wish
i
had
a
lace
vestee
and
some
long
white
gloves
do
you
think
they
pretty
bob
no
i
think
they
silly
retorted
bob
you
would
catch
bobby
littell
going
traveling
in
a
party
dress
and
wearing
all
the
family
jewels
huh
here
comes
the
conductor
wonder
what
he
wants
the
conductor
it
developed
was
shifting
passengers
from
the
car
behind
the
one
in
which
bob
and
betty
had
seats
it
was
to
be
dropped
at
the
next
junction
and
the
few
passengers
remaining
were
to
be
accommodated
in
this
coach
you
all
right
do
have
to
make
any
change
said
the
official
kindly
after
examining
their
tickets
i
tell
the
porter
you
go
through
to
chicago
the
car
had
been
fairly
well
crowded
before
and
the
extra
influx
taxed
every
available
seat
betty
took
out
her
crocheting
and
bob
decided
that
he
would
go
in
search
of
a
i
come
back
and
get
you
and
we
go
out
on
the
observation
platform
he
said
contentedly
chain
six
double
crochet
into
the
ring
betty
murmured
her
directions
half
aloud
right
here
the
porter
voice
aroused
her
there
in
the
aisle
stood
the
girl
she
had
noticed
in
the
diner
and
with
her
was
a
harassed
looking
porter
carrying
three
heavy
bags
perhaps
you
would
just
as
lief
take
the
aisle
seat
said
the
girl
surveying
betty
as
a
princess
might
gaze
upon
an
annoying
little
page
i
travel
better
when
i
can
have
plenty
of
fresh
air
you
might
have
thought
i
was
a
bug
betty
confided
later
to
bob
the
diamonds
flashed
as
the
girl
loosened
the
fur
collar
at
her
throat
please
move
over
she
commanded
calmly
betty
was
bewildered
but
her
innate
courtesy
died
hard
you
you
made
a
mistake
she
faltered
this
seat
is
taken
the
conductor
said
to
take
any
vacant
seat
said
the
newcomer
you
ca
hold
seats
in
a
public
conveyance
my
father
says
so
put
the
bags
in
here
porter
be
careful
of
that
enamel
leather
to
betty
dismay
she
settled
herself
flounces
and
furs
and
bags
in
the
narrow
space
that
belonged
to
bob
and
by
an
adroit
pressure
of
her
elbow
made
it
impossible
for
betty
to
resume
her
crocheting
i
think
you
done
made
a
mistake
lady
ventured
the
porter
this
seat
belongs
to
a
young
man
what
has
a
ticket
to
chicago
well
i
going
to
chicago
answered
the
girl
composedly
do
you
expect
me
to
stand
up
the
rest
of
the
way
the
agent
had
no
business
to
sell
me
a
reservation
in
a
car
that
only
went
as
far
as
the
junction
the
porter
withdrew
shaking
his
head
and
in
a
few
minutes
bob
came
back
to
his
seat
betty
watching
the
girl
saw
her
glance
sidewise
at
him
from
her
narrow
eyes
though
she
pretended
to
be
absorbed
in
a
magazine
i
beg
your
pardon
said
bob
politely
there
was
no
response
pardon
me
but
you
made
a
mistake
began
bob
again
you
are
in
the
wrong
seat
the
magazine
came
down
with
a
crash
and
the
girl
face
distorted
with
rage
appeared
in
its
place
well
if
i
am
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
she
shrilled
rudely
chapter
vi
fine
feathers
betty
gordon
had
always
foolishly
perhaps
associated
courtesy
and
with
beautiful
clothes
this
strange
girl
who
could
speak
so
on
such
slight
provocation
none
at
all
to
be
exact
wore
a
handsome
suit
and
if
her
jewelry
was
too
conspicuous
it
had
the
merit
of
being
genuine
betty
herself
had
a
lively
temper
but
she
was
altogether
free
from
snappishness
and
when
she
blew
up
the
cause
was
sure
to
be
unmistakable
and
significant
bob
jumped
when
the
girl
fired
her
question
at
him
there
had
been
nothing
in
his
limited
experience
with
girls
to
prepare
him
for
such
an
outburst
betty
half
expected
him
to
acquiesce
and
leave
the
stranger
in
possession
of
his
seat
but
to
her
surprise
he
simply
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
not
however
before
betty
had
seen
something
bordering
on
contempt
in
his
eyes
i
hate
to
have
bob
look
at
me
like
that
she
thought
it
was
as
if
he
did
like
her
or
was
mad
at
her
what
is
it
i
am
trying
to
say
bob
looked
as
if
as
if
oh
bother
i
know
what
i
mean
but
i
ca
say
it
the
little
spitfire
in
the
seat
beside
her
wriggled
uneasily
as
if
she
too
were
not
as
comfortable
as
she
would
pretend
bob
silent
reception
of
her
discourtesy
had
infuriated
her
and
she
knew
better
than
betty
where
she
stood
in
the
boy
estimation
she
had
instantly
forfeited
his
respect
and
probably
his
admiration
forever
in
a
few
minutes
bob
was
back
and
with
him
the
conductor
young
lady
you
in
the
wrong
seat
that
official
announced
in
a
tone
that
admitted
of
no
trifling
you
were
in
eighteen
in
the
other
car
and
i
had
to
move
you
to
in
here
just
follow
me
please
he
reached
in
and
took
one
of
the
suitcases
and
bob
took
the
other
two
the
girl
opened
her
mouth
glanced
at
the
conductor
and
thought
better
of
whatever
she
was
going
to
say
meekly
she
followed
him
to
another
section
on
the
other
side
of
the
car
and
found
herself
compelled
to
share
a
seat
with
a
woman
evidently
a
sufferer
from
hay
fever
as
she
sneezed
incessantly
bob
dropped
down
in
his
old
place
and
shot
a
quizzical
look
at
betty
flame
city
may
be
tough
he
observed
and
i
be
the
last
one
to
claim
that
it
possessed
one
grain
of
culture
but
at
that
i
ca
remember
having
a
pitched
battle
with
a
girl
during
my
existence
there
she
used
to
having
her
own
way
said
betty
with
a
laudable
ambition
to
be
charitable
an
intention
which
she
inadvertently
destroyed
by
adding
vigorously
she
get
that
knocked
out
of
her
if
she
lived
west
a
little
while
guess
the
east
can
be
trusted
to
smooth
her
down
commented
bob
grimly
unless
she
planning
to
live
in
seclusion
she
wo
get
far
in
peace
or
happiness
unless
she
behaves
a
bit
more
like
a
human
being
the
girl
was
more
or
less
in
evidence
during
the
rest
of
the
trip
and
incurred
the
cordial
enmity
of
every
woman
in
the
car
by
the
coolness
with
which
she
appropriated
the
dressing
room
in
the
morning
and
curled
her
hair
and
made
an
elaborate
toilet
in
perfect
indifference
to
the
other
feminine
travelers
who
were
shut
out
till
she
had
the
last
hairpin
adjusted
to
her
satisfaction
she
was
met
at
the
chicago
terminal
by
a
party
of
gay
friends
who
whisked
her
off
in
a
palatial
car
and
bob
and
betty
who
acting
on
advice
spent
their
wait
between
trains
driving
along
the
lake
shore
drive
forgot
her
completely
but
first
betty
fell
victim
to
the
charms
of
a
hat
displayed
in
a
smart
little
millinery
shop
and
had
an
argument
with
bob
in
which
she
came
off
victor
oh
bob
what
a
darling
hat
she
had
exclaimed
drawing
him
over
to
the
window
as
they
turned
down
the
first
street
from
the
station
i
must
have
it
i
want
to
look
nice
when
i
meet
the
girls
in
washington
you
look
nice
now
declared
bob
sturdily
but
if
you
want
to
buy
it
go
ahead
he
encouraged
her
ask
how
much
it
is
though
he
added
with
a
sudden
recollection
of
the
fabulous
prices
said
to
be
charged
for
a
yard
of
ribbon
and
a
bit
of
lace
the
hat
in
question
was
a
soft
brown
beaver
that
rolled
slightly
away
from
the
face
and
boasted
as
trimming
a
single
scarlet
quill
it
was
undeniably
becoming
and
bob
gave
it
his
unqualified
approval
and
you
will
want
a
veil
insinuated
the
clever
young
french
saleswoman
see
it
is
charming
she
threw
over
the
hat
a
cobwebby
pattern
of
brown
silk
net
embroidered
heavily
with
chenille
dots
and
deftly
draped
it
back
from
glowing
face
you
do
want
a
veil
said
bob
bluntly
now
the
mirror
told
betty
that
the
veil
looked
very
well
indeed
and
made
her
she
was
sure
of
it
prettier
betty
was
a
good
traveler
and
the
journey
had
not
tired
her
the
excitement
and
pleasure
of
choosing
a
new
hat
had
brought
a
flush
to
her
cheeks
and
the
shining
brown
eyes
that
gazed
back
at
her
from
the
glass
assured
her
that
a
veil
was
something
greatly
to
be
desired
you
do
want
it
repeated
bob
you
only
thirteen
and
you
look
silly
do
you
want
to
dress
like
that
girl
on
the
train
if
bob
had
stopped
to
think
he
would
have
realized
that
his
remarks
were
not
exactly
tactful
especially
the
reference
to
betty
age
just
when
she
fancied
that
she
looked
very
grown
up
indeed
she
was
fond
of
braiding
her
heavy
thick
hair
and
wrapping
it
around
her
head
so
that
there
were
no
to
betray
her
in
betty
experience
the
border
line
between
a
young
lady
and
a
little
girl
was
determined
by
the
absence
or
presence
of
how
much
is
it
she
asked
the
saleswoman
oh
but
six
dollars
answered
that
young
person
with
a
wave
of
one
jeweled
hand
as
though
six
dollars
were
a
mere
nothing
i
take
it
said
betty
decisively
and
i
wear
it
and
the
hat
too
please
you
can
wrap
up
my
old
one
bob
was
silent
until
the
transaction
had
been
completed
and
they
were
out
of
the
shop
you
wait
here
and
i
see
about
getting
a
car
to
take
us
along
the
drive
he
said
then
you
you
not
mad
at
me
are
you
bob
faltered
betty
putting
an
appealing
hand
on
his
arm
i
have
had
any
fun
with
clothes
all
summer
long
no
i
not
mad
but
i
think
you
an
awful
chump
replied
bob
with
his
characteristic
frankness
before
the
drive
was
over
betty
was
inclined
to
agree
with
him
the
car
was
an
open
one
and
while
the
day
was
warm
and
sunny
there
was
a
lively
breeze
blowing
straight
off
the
lake
the
veil
persisted
in
blowing
first
into
betty
eyes
then
into
bob
and
interfered
to
an
amazing
degree
with
their
enjoyment
of
the
scenery
finally
as
they
rounded
a
curve
and
caught
the
full
breath
of
the
breeze
the
veil
blew
away
entirely
let
it
go
said
betty
resignedly
it
cost
me
six
dollars
to
learn
i
do
want
to
wear
a
veil
bob
privately
decided
he
liked
her
much
better
without
the
flimsy
net
affair
but
he
wisely
determined
not
to
air
his
opinion
there
was
no
use
he
told
himself
in
rubbing
it
in
they
had
lunch
in
a
cozy
little
and
went
back
to
the
train
like
seasoned
travelers
bob
was
an
ideal
companion
for
such
journeys
for
he
never
lost
his
head
and
never
missed
connections
while
nervous
haste
was
unknown
to
him
wo
i
be
glad
to
see
the
littells
exclaimed
betty
watching
the
porter
make
up
their
berths
so
shall
i
agreed
bob
did
you
ever
know
such
hospitable
people
asking
a
whole
raft
of
us
to
spend
the
week
at
fairfields
how
many
did
bobby
write
would
be
there
let
see
said
betty
checking
off
on
her
fingers
there
be
bobby
and
louise
of
course
and
esther
who
is
too
young
to
go
away
to
school
but
who
will
want
to
do
everything
we
do
libbie
littell
and
another
vermont
girl
we
do
know
frances
martin
you
and
i
and
the
five
boys
littell
wrote
you
about
the
tucker
twins
timothy
derby
sydney
cooke
and
winifred
marion
brown
twelve
of
us
wo
it
be
fun
i
do
wish
the
guerin
girls
could
be
there
but
we
see
them
at
the
school
i
like
to
see
that
winifred
marion
chap
declared
bob
a
boy
with
a
girl
name
has
his
troubles
cut
out
for
him
i
should
say
lots
of
have
girls
names
in
history
contributed
betty
absently
what
time
do
we
get
into
washington
bob
around
five
probably
six
for
we
likely
to
be
a
bit
late
replied
bob
let
go
to
bed
now
betty
and
get
an
early
start
in
the
morning
the
day
spent
on
the
train
was
uneventful
and
contrary
to
expectations
they
were
on
time
at
every
station
betty
heart
beat
faster
as
the
hands
of
her
little
wrist
watch
pointed
to
and
the
passengers
began
to
gather
up
their
wraps
the
porter
came
through
and
brushed
them
thoroughly
and
betty
adjusted
her
new
hat
carefully
the
long
train
slid
into
the
union
station
with
what
different
emotions
both
bob
and
betty
had
seen
the
beautiful
brilliantly
lighted
building
on
the
occasion
of
their
first
trip
to
washington
then
each
had
been
without
a
friend
in
the
great
city
and
now
they
were
to
be
welcomed
by
a
host
betty
cheeks
flushed
but
her
lovely
eyes
filled
with
a
sudden
rush
of
tears
i
so
happy
she
whispered
to
the
bewildered
bob
want
my
handkerchief
he
asked
anxiously
at
which
betty
tried
not
to
laugh
chapter
vii
fun
at
fairfields
the
long
platform
was
crowded
betty
followed
bob
who
carried
their
bags
she
tried
to
peer
ahead
but
the
moving
forms
blocked
her
view
just
after
they
passed
through
the
gate
some
one
caught
her
betty
you
lamb
i
never
was
so
glad
to
see
any
one
in
my
life
cried
a
gay
voice
and
bobby
littell
hugged
her
close
in
one
of
her
rare
caresses
bob
henderson
held
out
his
hand
as
soon
as
bobby
released
betty
he
liked
this
straightforward
brusque
girl
who
so
evidently
adored
betty
why
bob
you
grown
a
foot
was
bobby
littell
greeting
to
him
bob
modestly
disclaimed
any
such
record
and
then
louise
and
esther
who
had
swooped
upon
betty
turned
to
shake
hands
with
him
the
rest
of
the
crowd
is
out
in
the
car
said
bobby
carelessly
outside
the
station
in
the
open
plaza
a
handsome
closed
car
awaited
them
the
chauffeur
cap
in
hand
stood
back
as
a
procession
of
boys
and
girls
advanced
upon
bob
and
betty
and
their
escort
oh
betty
dear
short
plump
libbie
littell
who
had
relinquished
her
claim
to
the
name
of
betty
in
betty
gordon
favor
some
time
ago
hurled
herself
upon
her
friend
to
think
we
going
to
the
same
school
well
frances
is
going
too
said
bobby
practically
she
might
like
to
be
introduced
you
know
betty
this
is
frances
martin
a
vermont
girl
who
is
out
after
all
the
latin
prizes
frances
smiled
a
slow
sweet
smile
and
behind
thick
glasses
her
dark
eyes
said
that
she
was
very
glad
to
know
betty
gordon
now
the
boys
announced
the
irrepressible
bobby
apparently
taking
bob
introduction
to
frances
for
granted
the
boys
will
please
line
up
and
i
indicate
them
the
five
lads
obediently
came
forward
and
ranged
themselves
in
a
row
from
left
to
right
chanted
bobby
we
have
the
tucker
twins
tommy
and
teddy
brown
who
asks
his
friends
to
use
his
initials
and
punches
those
who
refuse
timothy
derby
who
reads
poetry
and
sydney
cooke
who
ought
to
and
bobby
completed
her
speech
with
a
wicked
grin
for
she
had
managed
to
hit
several
weaknesses
as
an
introducer
she
announced
calmly
to
carter
the
personification
of
propriety
horror
i
think
i
do
rather
well
they
stowed
themselves
into
the
limousine
somehow
the
girls
settled
more
or
less
comfortably
on
the
seats
the
boys
squeezed
in
between
hanging
on
the
running
board
and
spilling
over
into
carter
domain
bob
liked
the
five
boys
at
once
and
they
seemed
to
accept
him
as
one
of
them
if
he
had
had
a
little
fear
that
he
would
feel
diffident
and
unboyish
among
lads
of
his
own
age
it
vanished
at
the
first
contact
betty
you
sweet
child
how
we
have
missed
you
cried
littell
standing
on
the
lowest
step
under
the
as
the
car
swept
up
the
drive
of
fairfields
as
the
littell
home
was
called
behind
her
waited
littell
fully
recovered
from
the
injury
to
his
foot
which
had
made
him
an
invalid
during
betty
previous
visit
from
carter
who
had
beamingly
greeted
her
at
the
station
to
the
pretty
parlor
maid
who
smiled
as
betty
entered
her
room
to
find
her
turning
down
the
bed
covers
there
was
not
a
servant
who
did
not
remember
betty
and
seem
glad
to
see
her
it
is
so
good
to
have
you
two
here
again
littell
had
said
i
never
knew
such
people
betty
repeated
to
herself
twenty
times
that
evening
how
lovely
they
are
to
bob
and
me
littell
who
was
happiest
when
entertaining
young
people
had
put
the
six
boys
on
the
third
floor
in
three
connecting
rooms
the
girls
were
on
the
second
floor
and
esther
the
youngest
who
had
strenuously
fought
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
shadyside
with
her
two
sisters
was
almost
beside
herself
with
the
effort
to
be
in
all
the
rooms
at
once
and
hear
what
every
one
was
saying
i
so
glad
your
uncle
let
you
come
said
bobby
as
they
waited
for
betty
to
change
into
a
light
house
frock
for
dinner
i
do
know
much
about
this
school
except
that
mother
went
to
school
with
the
principal
that
was
a
characteristic
bobby
littell
remark
and
the
other
girls
laughed
i
had
a
letter
from
a
girl
who
lives
in
glenside
confided
betty
her
hair
she
and
her
sister
are
going
norma
and
alice
guerin
i
know
you
like
them
norma
wrote
her
mother
went
to
shadyside
when
it
was
a
day
school
yes
i
believe
it
was
years
and
years
ago
returned
louise
littell
the
aristocratic
families
who
lived
on
large
estates
used
to
send
their
daughters
to
warde
her
daughter
eustice
is
the
principal
now
betty
wondered
if
norma
guerin
mother
had
belonged
to
one
of
the
families
who
owned
large
estates
but
they
went
down
to
dinner
presently
and
she
forgot
the
guerins
for
the
time
being
that
was
a
busy
week
for
the
school
boys
and
girls
the
beautiful
house
and
grounds
of
fairfields
were
at
their
disposal
and
the
gallant
host
and
gentle
hostess
gave
themselves
up
to
the
whims
and
wishes
of
the
houseful
of
young
people
racket
while
you
may
for
discipline
is
coming
laughed
littell
when
he
went
upstairs
unexpectedly
early
one
night
and
caught
the
abashed
tucker
twins
sliding
down
the
banisters
both
bob
and
betty
had
wired
gordon
of
their
safe
arrival
in
washington
and
bob
had
also
telegraphed
his
aunts
while
they
were
at
fairfields
a
letter
reached
them
from
miss
hope
and
miss
charity
describing
in
glowing
terms
the
boarding
house
in
which
they
were
living
and
the
california
climate
which
the
writers
declared
made
them
feel
twenty
years
younger
so
bob
was
assured
that
the
elderly
ladies
were
neither
homesick
nor
unhappy
and
that
added
appreciably
to
his
peace
of
mind
he
and
betty
found
time
too
to
slip
away
from
their
gay
companions
and
go
to
the
old
bookshop
where
lockwood
hale
browsed
among
his
dusty
volumes
he
had
set
bob
upon
the
trail
that
led
him
west
and
brought
him
finally
to
his
surviving
kin
and
the
boy
felt
warm
gratitude
to
the
old
man
and
littell
rigidly
insisted
that
the
last
night
before
the
young
folks
started
for
shadyside
must
be
reserved
for
final
packing
and
early
retirement
so
that
the
gay
band
might
begin
their
journey
auspiciously
the
tuesday
evening
before
the
thursday
they
were
to
leave
for
school
the
host
and
hostess
gave
a
dance
for
their
young
people
i
glad
to
have
at
least
one
chance
to
wear
this
dress
observed
bobby
smoothing
down
the
folds
of
her
frock
with
satisfaction
the
only
thing
i
do
like
about
shadyside
so
far
is
that
restriction
about
party
clothes
i
imagine
it
is
a
wise
rule
in
many
ways
said
betty
sagely
thinking
particularly
of
the
guerin
girls
who
would
probably
be
to
get
even
the
one
evening
frock
allowed
you
know
how
some
girls
are
bobby
they
come
with
a
dozen
crêpe
de
chine
and
georgette
dresses
and
about
three
clean
blouses
for
wear
like
ruth
gladys
royal
giggled
bobby
i
remember
her
at
miss
graham
last
year
goodness
the
clothes
that
girl
would
wear
the
rest
of
us
did
even
try
to
compete
and
by
the
way
girls
ruth
gladys
is
going
to
shadyside
her
aunt
telephoned
mother
last
night
while
we
were
at
the
movies
that
the
girl
we
went
to
call
on
that
day
we
saw
peabody
tackle
bob
in
the
hotel
louise
explained
in
an
aside
to
betty
i
wonder
why
every
one
seems
bent
and
determined
to
go
to
shadyside
this
year
because
it
is
a
fine
school
with
a
reputation
bobby
who
had
studied
the
catalogue
informed
her
sister
primly
i
not
going
objected
esther
i
think
it
mean
mother
and
dad
need
one
girl
at
home
dearest
her
mother
reminded
her
as
she
came
in
looking
very
handsome
and
kindly
in
a
black
spangled
net
gown
all
ready
girls
then
suppose
we
go
down
it
was
a
simple
and
informal
dance
as
befitted
the
ages
of
the
guests
but
and
littell
knew
to
perfection
the
secret
of
making
each
one
enjoy
himself
there
were
a
handful
of
outside
friends
invited
and
betty
to
whom
a
party
was
a
source
of
delight
felt
as
she
confided
to
bob
as
though
she
were
walking
on
air
you
look
awfully
nice
in
that
white
stuff
he
said
frankly
and
betty
liked
the
comment
on
her
pretty
ruffled
white
frock
which
she
had
dubiously
decided
a
moment
before
was
too
plain
betty
was
what
country
folk
call
a
dancer
and
she
quickly
learned
the
new
steps
she
had
had
no
opportunity
to
practice
since
going
west
all
the
girls
and
most
of
the
boys
were
excellent
dancers
too
and
bob
was
not
allowed
to
beg
off
frances
martin
the
last
girl
one
would
have
named
had
taught
a
dancing
class
in
her
home
town
with
great
success
and
she
volunteered
to
lead
bob
to
his
surprise
the
boy
found
he
liked
the
music
and
movement
and
before
the
evening
was
over
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
become
a
good
dancer
the
party
broke
up
promptly
at
eleven
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
whir
of
the
last
motor
bearing
home
the
departing
guests
died
away
there
was
a
natural
lingering
to
talk
things
over
but
by
twelve
the
house
was
silent
and
dark
betty
had
just
fairly
dozed
off
when
some
one
woke
her
by
shaking
her
gently
betty
betty
please
wake
up
whispered
a
frightened
little
voice
chapter
viii
too
much
party
betty
shared
a
room
with
bobby
the
single
beds
were
separated
by
a
table
on
which
an
electric
drop
light
and
the
water
pitcher
and
glasses
were
placed
betty
first
impulse
was
to
snap
on
the
light
but
as
she
put
out
her
hand
esther
grasped
her
wrist
it
only
me
she
whispered
her
teeth
chattering
with
fright
wake
bobby
up
are
you
cold
asked
betty
sitting
up
anxiously
perhaps
you
were
too
warm
dancing
do
you
want
to
get
into
bed
with
me
it
was
a
warm
night
for
october
and
betty
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
esther
shivering
i
ca
find
libbie
esther
cried
oh
betty
i
never
thought
she
would
do
it
never
betty
reached
for
her
dressing
gown
and
slippers
do
cry
or
you
wake
up
bobby
she
advised
the
sobbing
esther
come
on
i
go
back
with
you
do
make
a
noise
the
girls
occupied
three
connecting
rooms
and
esther
and
libbie
had
slept
in
the
end
of
the
suite
to
reach
it
now
the
two
girls
had
to
go
through
the
room
where
louise
and
frances
lay
slumbering
peacefully
betty
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
they
gained
esther
room
and
she
closed
the
door
carefully
and
turned
on
the
light
esther
bed
madly
tumbled
and
libbie
evidently
occupied
that
night
but
now
empty
were
revealed
esther
dropped
down
on
the
floor
wrapping
her
kimono
about
her
and
regarded
betty
trustfully
she
was
sure
her
friend
would
straighten
things
out
where
is
libbie
demanded
betty
what
is
she
doing
i
do
know
admitted
esther
unhappily
but
i
tell
you
what
i
think
i
think
she
eloped
esther
was
only
eleven
and
as
she
sat
on
the
floor
and
stared
at
betty
from
great
wet
blue
eyes
she
seemed
very
young
indeed
eloped
gasped
betty
why
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
she
always
talking
about
it
the
younger
girl
wailed
beginning
to
cry
again
she
says
it
the
most
romantic
way
to
be
married
and
she
means
to
throw
her
hope
chest
out
of
the
window
first
and
slide
down
a
rope
made
of
bedsheets
well
i
think
it
very
silly
to
talk
like
that
scolded
betty
and
what
more
esther
however
much
libbie
may
talk
of
eloping
she
done
it
this
time
all
her
clothes
are
here
and
her
shoes
and
her
hat
here
her
purse
on
the
dresser
too
i
never
thought
of
looking
to
see
if
her
clothes
were
here
confessed
esther
but
then
where
is
she
betty
that
what
i
mean
to
find
out
announced
betty
with
more
confidence
than
she
felt
come
on
esther
and
do
trip
on
your
kimono
or
walk
into
anything
they
tiptoed
out
into
the
wide
hall
and
had
reached
the
head
of
the
beautiful
carved
staircase
when
they
saw
a
dim
form
coming
toward
them
esther
nearly
shrieked
aloud
but
betty
put
a
hand
over
her
mouth
in
time
who
who
are
you
stammered
betty
her
heart
beating
so
fast
it
was
painful
betty
bob
stifled
a
gasp
for
the
love
of
mike
what
are
you
doing
at
this
time
of
night
esther
here
we
hunting
for
libbie
whispered
betty
she
is
in
her
room
so
that
it
for
some
reason
unknown
to
the
girls
bob
seemed
to
be
vastly
relieved
i
was
just
going
after
littell
he
added
but
libbie
is
lost
maybe
she
is
sick
urged
betty
she
all
right
declared
bob
confidently
you
see
i
could
go
to
sleep
and
after
i
been
in
bed
about
an
hour
i
got
up
and
sat
by
the
window
i
was
staring
down
into
the
garden
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
saw
something
white
begin
to
move
and
creep
about
i
watched
it
a
few
moments
and
i
got
the
idea
it
was
a
burglar
or
a
sneak
thief
it
kept
so
close
to
the
house
i
came
down
to
call
littell
and
bumped
into
you
do
you
suppose
it
is
libbie
chattered
esther
why
would
she
go
into
the
garden
in
the
middle
of
the
night
walking
in
her
sleep
explained
bob
i
heard
it
is
dangerous
to
waken
a
suddenly
perhaps
you
better
call
littell
betty
and
i
sit
here
on
the
window
seat
and
see
that
she
does
walk
out
into
the
road
the
two
girls
hurried
off
and
tapped
lightly
on
littell
door
that
lady
hurriedly
admitted
them
her
motherly
mind
instantly
picturing
something
wrong
it
libbie
said
betty
softly
bob
saw
her
from
his
window
in
the
garden
and
he
thinks
she
walking
in
her
sleep
we
do
want
to
frighten
her
what
can
we
do
i
be
right
out
said
littell
reassuringly
libbie
mother
used
to
walk
in
her
sleep
too
i
think
i
can
get
the
child
into
bed
without
waking
her
at
all
in
a
few
moments
she
came
out
a
heavy
corduroy
robe
and
slippers
protecting
her
against
the
night
air
esther
lamb
you
stay
here
in
the
hall
with
bob
she
directed
her
youngest
daughter
you
wo
be
afraid
with
bob
will
you
dear
i
want
too
many
to
go
down
or
we
may
startle
libbie
betty
crept
downstairs
after
littell
the
soft
thick
rugs
making
their
progress
absolutely
noiseless
not
a
step
in
the
staircase
creaked
they
found
the
chain
and
bolt
drawn
from
the
heavy
front
door
libbie
had
evidently
let
herself
out
with
no
difficulty
from
the
wide
hall
window
bob
and
esther
watched
breathlessly
just
go
up
to
her
quietly
and
take
one
of
her
hands
littell
whispered
to
betty
i
take
the
other
and
if
i
not
mistaken
we
can
lead
her
into
the
house
libbie
stood
motionless
beside
a
rosebush
as
they
approached
her
her
eyes
were
wide
open
and
her
dark
hair
floated
over
her
shoulders
in
her
white
nightdress
the
moonlight
full
upon
her
she
looked
very
pretty
and
yet
so
weird
that
betty
could
not
repress
a
shiver
littell
did
not
speak
but
took
one
of
the
limp
hands
in
hers
and
betty
took
the
other
libbie
made
no
resistance
and
allowed
them
to
draw
her
toward
the
house
they
crossed
the
threshold
led
her
upstairs
past
the
quivering
esther
and
bob
huddled
on
the
windowseat
and
into
the
bedroom
she
had
so
unceremoniously
left
then
littell
lifted
her
in
strong
arms
put
her
gently
down
on
the
bed
and
libbie
rolled
up
like
a
little
kitten
tucked
one
hand
under
her
cheek
and
continued
to
sleep
now
go
to
bed
children
do
commanded
littell
bob
i
so
thankful
you
saw
that
child
she
might
have
wandered
off
or
caught
a
severe
cold
as
it
is
i
do
believe
she
has
been
out
very
long
the
matter
esther
can
i
come
and
sleep
with
you
pleaded
esther
i
afraid
to
sleep
with
libbie
she
might
do
it
again
i
do
think
so
not
said
her
mother
smiling
however
chicken
come
and
sleep
with
me
if
you
rest
better
betty
awoke
and
went
in
later
that
night
to
see
if
libbie
had
vanished
again
but
found
her
sleeping
normally
in
the
morning
the
girl
was
much
surprised
to
find
she
had
been
wandering
in
the
garden
and
betrayed
considerable
interest
in
the
details
betty
decided
that
it
would
be
better
to
omit
esther
belief
that
she
had
eloped
and
libbie
was
allowed
to
remain
in
blissful
ignorance
of
the
action
her
youthful
cousin
attributed
to
her
the
last
day
sped
by
all
too
soon
and
what
the
tucker
twins
persisted
in
pessimistically
designating
the
fateful
thursday
was
upon
them
i
do
know
why
you
sigh
so
frequently
dimpled
betty
who
sat
next
to
tommy
tucker
at
the
breakfast
table
i
very
anxious
to
go
to
school
do
you
really
like
to
go
back
it
like
this
said
tommy
the
dark
tucker
twin
solemnly
from
four
to
ten
except
on
drill
nights
i
like
it
well
enough
and
from
ten
lights
out
till
six
reveille
i
fairly
contented
but
from
nine
to
four
when
we
cooped
up
in
classrooms
i
simply
detest
school
teddy
the
light
tucker
twin
nodded
in
confirmation
i
suppose
we
have
to
be
educated
he
admitted
with
the
air
of
one
making
a
generous
concession
to
public
opinion
but
i
do
see
why
they
find
it
necessary
to
prolong
the
agony
any
one
who
can
read
and
write
can
make
a
living
perhaps
your
father
hopes
you
do
a
bit
more
than
that
suggested
littell
slyly
this
effectually
silenced
the
twins
for
their
wealthy
father
was
a
splendid
scientist
who
had
made
several
explorations
that
had
contributed
materially
to
the
knowledge
of
the
scientific
world
and
he
had
lost
the
sight
of
one
eye
in
a
laboratory
experiment
undertaken
to
advance
the
cause
for
which
he
labored
the
littell
car
carried
the
twelve
to
the
station
soon
after
breakfast
and
though
shadyside
and
salsette
unlike
many
of
the
large
northern
schools
ran
no
special
the
few
passengers
who
were
not
school
bound
found
themselves
decidedly
in
the
minority
on
the
local
that
morning
remember
betty
you
and
bob
are
to
spend
the
holidays
with
us
said
littell
as
she
kissed
her
if
your
uncle
comes
down
from
canada
he
must
come
too
all
aboard
shouted
the
conductor
who
foresaw
a
lively
trip
no
you
ca
go
through
the
gate
nobody
can
the
crowd
of
fathers
and
mothers
and
younger
brothers
and
sisters
pressed
close
to
the
iron
grating
as
the
train
got
under
way
on
the
back
platform
the
tucker
twins
raised
their
voices
in
a
school
yell
that
would
have
horrified
the
dignified
heads
of
the
academy
had
they
been
there
to
hear
it
chapter
ix

tommy

tucker
soulfully
and
salsette
bred
chimed
in
his
brother
and
when
i
die
caroled
tommy
i
be
salsette
dead
they
finished
together
then
highly
satisfied
with
this
intelligible
ditty
they
burst
into
the
car
where
the
others
were
waiting
for
them
the
boys
had
appropriated
the
seats
at
the
forward
end
of
the
car
and
unfortunately
their
selection
included
a
seat
in
which
an
elderly
or
so
she
seemed
to
them
woman
sat
she
fidgeted
incessantly
folding
and
unfolding
her
long
traveling
coat
opening
and
closing
a
fitted
lunch
basket
and
arranging
and
several
small
unwieldy
parcels
and
heavy
books
that
slid
persistently
to
the
floor
with
the
jarring
of
the
train
when
the
conductor
came
through
for
tickets
she
discovered
that
she
had
mislaid
hers
and
it
was
necessary
to
flutter
the
pages
of
every
book
before
the
missing
bit
of
pasteboard
finally
dropped
from
between
the
leaves
of
the
last
one
opened
bob
with
instinctive
courtesy
had
offered
to
help
her
search
but
she
had
rebuffed
him
sharply
i
do
want
any
boy
pawing
over
my
belongings
she
informed
him
tartly
bob
flushed
a
little
it
was
impossible
not
to
help
it
but
he
said
nothing
meeting
betty
indignant
eyes
he
smiled
sweet
pickles
ejaculated
tommy
tucker
indignantly
here
you
timothy
hand
me
that
suitcase
at
your
feet
it
belongs
to
the
little
dark
girl
libbie
the
little
dark
girl
smiled
dreamily
as
timothy
passed
her
suitcase
to
tommy
she
and
timothy
derby
ignoring
the
jeers
of
their
friends
were
deep
in
two
white
and
gold
volumes
of
poetry
timothy
libbie
had
discovered
had
a
leaning
toward
the
romantic
in
fiction
though
he
preferred
his
served
in
rhyme
the
wicked
tommy
had
a
motive
in
asking
for
libbie
suitcase
it
was
much
smaller
and
lighter
than
any
of
the
others
and
he
swung
it
deftly
into
the
rack
over
the
vinegary
lady
unsuspecting
head
with
a
deftness
born
it
must
be
confessed
of
previous
practice
he
balanced
the
case
on
the
rim
so
that
the
first
lurch
of
the
train
catapulted
the
thing
down
squarely
on
the
woman
hat
snapping
a
shiny
hard
black
quill
in
two
i
must
say
she
sputtered
rising
angrily
who
put
that
up
there
if
anything
goes
in
that
rack
it
will
be
some
of
my
things
i
paid
for
this
seat
she
set
the
suitcase
out
into
the
aisle
with
a
decided
bang
and
lifted
up
the
wicker
lunch
basket
to
the
glee
of
the
watching
young
people
as
she
lifted
it
to
the
rack
two
china
cups
several
teaspoons
and
a
silver
cream
jug
sifted
down
the
cups
broke
on
the
floor
and
the
other
articles
rolled
under
the
seats
get
quick
cried
the
owner
my
two
best
cups
broken
and
i
thought
i
had
them
packed
so
well
pick
up
those
teaspoons
some
of
you
they
solid
silver
if
you
do
mind
boys
pawing
them
began
teddy
tucker
but
betty
intervened
oh
do
she
protested
softly
do
be
so
mean
pick
them
up
please
do
so
down
on
their
hands
and
knees
went
the
six
lads
and
if
in
their
earnestness
they
bumped
into
the
elderly
woman
hat
box
and
knocked
down
her
books
that
really
should
not
be
held
against
them
now
for
mercy
sake
do
let
me
hear
from
you
again
was
her
speech
of
thanks
to
them
when
the
teaspoons
had
been
recovered
and
restored
to
her
she
might
have
been
severely
left
alone
after
this
if
sydney
cooke
had
not
discovered
a
remarkable
peculiarity
she
possessed
sydney
was
a
great
lover
of
games
and
he
had
brought
his
pocket
checkerboard
and
men
with
him
he
persuaded
winifred
marion
brown
to
play
a
game
with
him
and
the
rest
of
the
party
crowded
around
to
watch
i
trouble
you
to
let
me
pass
said
the
owner
of
the
teaspoons
when
sydney
had
just
made
his
first
play
the
group
parted
to
let
her
through
closed
in
again
and
opened
again
for
her
when
she
came
back
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
this
until
she
had
made
the
request
four
times
what
ails
that
woman
demanded
sydney
irritably
each
time
she
had
passed
him
she
had
brushed
his
elbow
scattering
his
checkers
about
ordinarily
sydney
was
beginning
to
weary
of
this
performance
what
do
you
think
snickered
bobby
littell
she
takes
a
white
tablet
every
five
minutes
honest
i
been
watching
her
she
sits
there
with
her
watch
in
her
hand
and
exactly
five
minutes
apart
i
timed
her
she
starts
for
the
water
cooler
she
puts
something
on
her
tongue
swallows
a
glass
of
water
and
comes
back
well
somebody
carry
her
a
gallon
jug
muttered
sydney
impatiently
i
ca
get
anywhere
if
she
is
going
to
parade
up
and
down
the
aisle
incessantly
do
worry
said
tommy
tucker
soothingly
i
adjust
this
little
matter
for
you
if
sydney
had
been
less
interested
in
his
game
he
might
have
felt
slightly
apprehensive
the
tucker
twins
were
famous
for
their
adjustments
tommy
went
down
the
aisle
and
slipped
into
the
seat
directly
back
of
the
woman
who
did
not
approve
of
boys
she
turned
and
regarded
him
hostilely
but
he
gazed
out
at
the
flying
landscape
the
moment
she
turned
around
he
ducked
to
the
floor
what
do
you
suppose
he
is
doing
whispered
bobby
to
betty
tommy
can
think
up
tricks
faster
than
any
boy
i
ever
knew
whatever
tommy
was
doing
he
finished
in
a
very
few
moments
and
sauntered
back
to
the
checker
game
his
eyes
dancing
sydney
and
winifred
were
absorbed
in
their
game
and
the
others
with
the
exception
of
bobby
and
betty
had
not
noticed
tommy
brief
absence
oh
look
betty
clutched
bobby
arm
excitedly
what
has
happened
to
her
the
woman
who
had
sat
with
her
watch
in
her
hand
snapped
it
shut
prepared
to
make
another
journey
to
the
water
cooler
she
half
rose
an
alarmed
expression
flitted
over
her
face
and
she
sank
into
her
seat
again
tommy
eyes
were
studiously
on
the
checkerboard
with
one
convulsive
effort
the
woman
struggled
to
her
feet
grasped
the
and
jerked
it
twice
then
dropped
into
her
seat
and
began
to
weep
hysterically
the
brakes
jarred
down
and
the
train
came
to
a
sudden
stop
that
sent
many
of
the
passengers
m
a
mad
scramble
forward
in
a
few
moments
the
conductor
flung
open
the
car
door
angrily
behind
him
two
anxious
young
brakesmen
peered
curiously
anybody
in
here
jerk
that
bellcord
demanded
the
conductor
scowling
certainly
it
was
i
said
the
elderly
woman
loftily
oh
you
did
eh
he
bristled
apparently
unworried
by
her
opinion
what
did
you
do
that
for
here
you
stopped
a
whole
train
i
considered
it
necessary
was
the
icy
reply
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
call
a
doctor
are
you
ill
the
conductor
voice
changed
perceptibly
i
doubt
if
there
is
a
doctor
on
the
train
but
i
see
tell
him
to
hurry
said
the
woman
commandingly
i
think
paralyzed
paralyzed
tommy
tucker
gave
a
loud
snort
and
fell
over
backward
into
the
arms
of
his
twin
the
conductor
shot
a
suspicious
glance
toward
him
he
had
traveled
on
school
trains
before
you
seem
to
be
all
right
madam
he
said
to
the
stricken
one
courteously
there
a
doctor
at
the
junction
i
sure
what
makes
you
think
you
paralyzed
my
good
man
said
the
woman
majestically
when
a
person
in
good
health
and
accustomed
to
normal
activity
suddenly
loses
the
power
to
use
her
er
feet
is
that
an
indication
of
some
physical
trouble
her
unfortunate
and
phrase
my
good
man
had
nettled
the
conductor
and
besides
his
train
was
losing
time
we
miss
connections
at
the
junction
if
we
fool
away
much
more
time
he
said
testily
i
wonder
why
look
here
no
wonder
you
ca
use
your
feet
to
the
elderly
woman
horror
he
had
swooped
down
and
laid
a
not
ungentle
hand
on
her
ankle
in
its
neat
and
shoe
now
he
took
out
his
knife
slashed
twice
and
held
up
the
pieces
of
a
stout
length
of
twine
you
were
tied
to
the
by
the
heels
of
your
shoes
he
informed
the
patient
grimly
one
foot
tied
to
the
other
too
well
jim
take
in
your
signals
guess
we
can
mosey
along
and
who
would
have
expected
her
to
wear
boots
exclaimed
bobby
with
real
amazement
showing
in
voice
and
look
the
few
passengers
in
the
car
aside
from
the
school
contingent
were
openly
laughing
the
victim
of
this
practical
joke
turned
a
dull
red
and
the
glare
she
turned
on
the
back
of
the
luckless
tommy
head
was
proof
enough
that
she
knew
exactly
where
to
lay
the
blame
however
she
said
nothing
nor
did
she
make
another
trip
down
the
aisle
and
as
tommy
philosophically
whispered
this
was
worth
all
he
had
dared
and
suffered
sydney
and
winifred
finished
their
game
before
the
junction
was
reached
and
that
brought
a
wild
charge
to
get
on
the
train
that
would
carry
them
to
shadyside
station
to
their
relief
there
was
no
sign
of
the
elderly
woman
in
the
new
car
and
as
they
were
all
a
bit
tired
from
the
journey
and
excitement
the
hour
ride
to
shadyside
from
the
junction
was
comparatively
quiet
betty
looked
eagerly
from
the
window
as
the
brakesman
shouted
shadyside
shadyside
chapter
x
shadyside
school
is
it
a
pretty
station
said
louise
littell
betty
agreed
with
her
the
lawn
was
still
green
about
the
gray
stone
building
and
the
tiles
on
the
roof
were
moss
green
too
the
long
platform
was
roofed
over
and
seemed
swarming
with
girls
and
boys
evidently
a
train
had
come
in
from
the
other
direction
a
few
minutes
before
the
junction
train
for
bags
and
suitcases
and
trunks
were
heaped
up
outside
the
baggage
room
door
and
the
busses
backed
up
to
the
edge
of
the
gravel
driveway
were
partially
filled
with
passengers
the
blue
and
silver
uniforms
of
the
salsette
cadets
were
much
in
evidence
and
betty
first
thought
was
of
how
nice
bob
henderson
would
look
in
uniform
there
our
friend
whispered
tommy
tucker
directing
attention
to
the
elderly
woman
whom
he
had
so
bothered
on
the
train
gee
do
you
suppose
she
goes
to
shadyside
i
thought
it
was
a
girls
school
oh
do
be
quiet
scolded
bobby
littell
tommy
you
got
us
in
a
peck
of
trouble
she
one
of
the
teachers
how
do
you
know
demanded
tommy
who
told
you
well
if
you
keep
still
a
minute
you
hear
said
the
exasperated
bobby
sure
enough
a
pleasant
woman
hardly
more
than
a
girl
was
escorting
the
woman
to
a
waiting
touring
car
you
the
last
of
the
staff
to
come
she
said
clearly
eustice
was
beginning
to
worry
about
you
will
you
tell
her
that
i
coming
up
in
the
bus
with
the
girls
all
right
you
win
admitted
tommy
why
could
she
say
she
was
a
teacher
instead
of
acting
so
blamed
exclusive
anyway
she
probably
connect
you
girls
with
me
all
boys
look
alike
to
her
she
has
a
wonderful
memory
like
a
camera
surmised
bobby
gloomily
you
wait
and
see
girls
are
all
of
you
for
shadyside
the
young
woman
had
come
up
to
them
and
now
she
smiled
at
the
giggling
chattering
group
with
engaging
friendliness
i
thought
you
were
we
take
this
over
here
give
your
baggage
checks
to
this
porter
i
miss
anderson
the
physical
instructor
salsette
boys
this
way
boomed
a
stentorian
voice
betty
see
you
soon
whispered
bob
giving
betty
hand
a
hurried
squeeze
we
only
across
the
lake
you
know
you
chaps
directed
the
voice
snappily
with
one
accord
the
group
dissolved
the
boys
hastening
to
the
stage
marked
salsette
and
the
girls
following
miss
anderson
there
were
two
stages
for
the
academy
and
two
for
shadyside
and
a
smaller
bus
which
they
afterward
learned
followed
the
route
to
the
town
which
was
not
on
the
railroad
betty
darling
a
pretty
girl
tumbled
down
the
stage
steps
and
nearly
choked
betty
with
the
fervency
of
her
embrace
it
was
norma
guerin
and
alice
was
waiting
smiling
betty
was
delighted
to
meet
these
old
friends
and
she
introduced
them
to
the
littell
girls
and
libbie
and
frances
in
the
happy
tangled
fashion
that
such
introductions
usually
are
performed
names
and
faces
get
straightened
out
more
gradually
the
stage
in
which
they
found
themselves
for
the
seven
girls
insisted
on
sitting
near
each
other
was
they
had
started
and
were
lurching
along
the
rather
uneven
road
when
betty
found
herself
staring
at
a
girl
on
the
other
side
of
the
bus
where
have
i
seen
her
before
she
puzzled
i
wonder
does
she
look
like
some
one
i
know
oh
i
remember
she
the
girl
we
saw
on
the
train
the
one
that
took
bob
seat
just
then
a
girl
sitting
up
near
the
driver
seat
leaned
forward
ada
she
called
ada
nansen
are
you
the
girl
they
say
brought
five
trunks
and
three
hat
boxes
well
they
little
ones
said
the
girl
sitting
opposite
betty
i
wanted
to
bring
three
wardrobe
trunks
but
mother
thought
eustice
might
make
a
fuss
so
the
girl
name
was
ada
nansen
betty
was
sure
she
remembered
their
encounter
on
the
train
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
ada
studiously
refused
to
meet
her
eye
betty
was
too
inexperienced
to
know
that
a
certain
type
of
girl
never
takes
a
step
toward
making
a
new
friend
unless
she
has
the
worldly
standing
of
that
friend
first
clearly
fixed
in
her
mind
what
gorgeous
furs
she
has
whispered
norma
guerin
do
you
know
her
betty
betty
shook
her
head
strictly
speaking
she
did
not
know
ada
what
she
did
know
of
her
was
not
pleasant
and
it
was
part
of
betty
personal
creed
never
to
repeat
anything
unkind
if
nothing
good
was
to
come
of
it
i
can
tell
bob
he
knows
about
her
she
said
to
herself
he
be
surprised
i
do
hope
she
has
brought
a
huge
wardrobe
to
school
to
make
norma
and
alice
feel
bad
though
both
the
guerin
girls
wore
the
neatest
blouses
and
suits
any
girl
could
immediately
have
told
you
that
their
clothes
were
not
new
that
season
and
that
the
little
bag
each
carried
had
been
oiled
and
polished
at
home
that
ada
nansen
trunks
were
worrying
norma
too
her
next
remark
showed
alice
and
i
have
only
one
trunk
between
us
she
confided
to
betty
mother
said
eustice
never
allowed
the
girls
to
dress
much
i
made
alice
party
frock
and
mine
too
they
plain
white
so
mine
said
betty
quickly
littell
would
let
her
daughters
have
elaborate
clothes
and
the
littells
have
oceans
of
money
i
believe
ada
can
wear
her
fine
feathers
now
she
has
twenty
minutes
ride
brought
them
in
sight
of
the
school
and
as
the
bus
turned
down
the
road
that
led
to
the
lake
many
exclamations
of
pleasure
were
heard
a
double
row
of
weeping
willows
now
bare
of
course
bordered
the
lake
and
the
sloping
lawns
of
the
school
led
down
to
these
the
red
brick
buildings
of
the
salsette
academy
could
be
glimpsed
on
the
other
shore
shadyside
consisted
of
a
large
brick
and
limestone
building
that
the
last
term
pupils
in
the
busses
obligingly
explained
was
the
administration
where
classes
were
taught
the
gymnasium
was
also
in
this
building
in
addition
were
three
gray
stone
buildings
connected
with
bridges
in
which
were
the
dormitories
the
teachers
rooms
the
dining
room
the
infirmary
and
the
kitchens
the
administration
building
was
also
connected
with
the
other
buildings
by
a
covered
passageway
which
they
were
to
discover
was
opened
only
in
bad
weather
eustice
the
principal
had
a
theory
that
girls
did
not
get
out
into
the
fresh
air
often
enough
the
main
building
possessed
a
handsome
doorway
and
here
the
busses
stopped
and
discharged
their
passengers
ada
my
dear
love
cried
a
girl
from
the
bus
behind
the
one
in
which
betty
and
her
friends
had
ridden
an
stout
girl
advanced
upon
ada
nansen
and
kissed
her
affectionately
look
quick
that
ruth
gladys
royal
whispered
bobby
i
hope
they
room
together
they
be
a
pair
ada
my
dear
love
she
mimicked
wickedly
libbie
let
that
be
a
warning
to
you
ruth
gladys
royal
is
terribly
romantic
too
miss
anderson
smiling
and
unhurried
marshaled
her
charges
into
the
large
foyer
and
announced
that
they
would
be
assigned
to
rooms
before
luncheon
eustice
will
speak
to
you
in
the
assembly
hall
this
afternoon
said
miss
anderson
and
you
will
meet
her
and
the
teachers
for
a
little
social
hour
two
busy
young
clerks
were
at
work
in
the
office
adjoining
the
foyer
and
for
those
who
were
already
provided
with
a
the
task
of
securing
a
room
was
a
matter
of
only
a
few
moments
our
girls
with
the
exception
of
louise
had
paired
off
when
they
had
registered
for
the
term
bobby
littell
and
betty
gordon
were
of
course
inseparable
libbie
and
frances
great
friends
in
their
home
town
naturally
gravitated
together
though
betty
would
have
chosen
a
less
studious
for
the
dreamy
libbie
she
needed
a
girl
who
would
know
more
accurately
what
she
was
doing
norma
and
alice
guerin
were
to
share
a
room
and
louise
felt
forlornly
out
of
things
when
miss
anderson
came
up
to
her
bringing
a
girl
with
wide
gray
eyes
and
a
boyish
grin
louise
littell
you
are
louise
are
you
asked
the
teacher
well
here
a
girl
who
come
to
us
from
a
western
army
post
her
name
is
constance
howard
and
she
does
know
a
single
girl
do
you
think
you
two
might
be
happy
together
constance
smiled
again
and
louise
warmed
perceptibly
louise
was
the
least
friendly
of
the
three
littell
girls
i
let
you
play
my
ukulele
offered
constance
eagerly
let
me
she
does
know
a
ukulele
from
a
music
box
said
bobby
with
sisterly
frankness
come
on
girls
let
go
up
and
see
our
rooms
they
tramped
up
the
broad
staircase
and
crossed
one
of
the
bridges
to
find
themselves
in
a
delightful
sunny
building
with
corridors
carpeted
in
softest
green
the
rooms
apparently
were
all
connecting
and
the
teacher
who
met
them
said
the
eight
friends
might
have
adjoining
rooms
as
long
as
they
gave
no
trouble
i
your
corridor
teacher
miss
lacey
she
explained
let
be
glad
she
is
the
one
we
saw
on
the
train
whispered
the
irrepressible
bobby
as
they
all
trooped
into
the
first
room
chapter
xi
first
impressions
it
was
soon
settled
that
betty
and
bobby
were
to
have
the
center
room
in
a
suite
of
three
and
libbie
and
frances
should
be
on
one
side
of
them
and
louise
and
constance
howard
on
the
other
there
was
a
perfectly
appointed
bathroom
opening
off
the
center
room
which
the
six
were
to
share
norma
and
alice
guerin
were
given
a
room
that
adjoined
that
occupied
by
libbie
and
frances
but
nominally
miss
lacey
explained
they
would
be
considered
as
a
unit
in
the
next
suite
of
three
connecting
rooms
fortunately
two
very
friendly
quiet
girls
drew
the
room
immediately
next
to
the
guerin
girls
but
betty
listen
whispered
norma
guerin
drawing
betty
aside
as
a
great
bumping
and
banging
announced
the
arrival
of
the
trunks
who
do
you
suppose
has
the
room
next
to
the
bennett
sisters
ada
nansen
and
ruth
gladys
royal
you
are
in
hard
luck
commented
bobby
who
had
overheard
as
she
danced
off
to
open
the
door
to
the
grinning
expressman
all
the
porters
are
busy
the
man
explained
so
i
just
told
tim
mccarthy
was
one
to
stand
by
and
let
work
go
undone
where
would
ye
be
wantin
these
little
bags
put
now
he
had
a
trunk
on
his
back
that
as
bobby
afterward
remarked
to
betty
would
have
done
for
an
elephant
girls
whose
trunk
is
this
demanded
bobby
not
mine
came
like
a
chorus
ada
nansen
read
betty
examining
the
card
bobby
that
one
of
the
five
they
directed
the
perspiring
expressman
to
the
right
door
and
it
is
to
be
regretted
shamelessly
peeped
while
he
toiled
up
and
down
bringing
the
five
trunks
and
three
hat
boxes
then
he
began
on
the
baggage
consigned
to
ruth
gladys
royal
and
the
watchers
counted
three
trunks
betty
looked
at
the
guerin
girls
and
laughed
eight
trunks
she
gasped
they
ca
get
that
number
in
one
room
not
and
have
any
room
for
the
furniture
norma
do
go
and
see
what
you
can
see
norma
sped
away
and
returned
as
speedily
her
eyes
blazing
what
do
you
think
she
demanded
furiously
they
had
some
of
put
in
our
room
three
i
counted
and
two
in
the
bennett
girls
room
as
mad
as
hops
the
bennett
girls
are
my
friends
declared
bobby
littell
sententiously
i
only
hope
they
mad
enough
to
hop
right
down
to
the
office
and
explain
the
state
of
things
but
the
luncheon
gong
sounded
just
then
and
a
laughing
colorful
throng
of
femininity
swept
down
the
broad
stairs
to
the
dining
room
how
lovely
said
betty
involuntarily
there
were
no
long
tables
in
the
large
airy
room
instead
round
tables
that
seated
from
six
to
eight
each
daintily
set
and
with
a
slender
vase
of
flowers
in
the
center
of
each
betty
and
bobby
had
the
same
thought
at
the
same
moment
if
we
could
only
sit
together
all
of
us
their
eyes
telegraphed
they
all
taking
the
tables
they
want
and
standing
by
the
chairs
whispered
betty
let
do
that
a
table
set
for
eight
was
close
to
the
door
betty
bobby
louise
frances
libbie
constance
norma
and
alice
gently
surrounded
this
and
stood
quietly
behind
the
chairs
some
one
somewhere
gave
a
signal
and
the
roomful
was
seated
as
if
by
magic
i
see
those
four
tables
over
by
the
window
are
for
the
teachers
whispered
betty
i
see
miss
anderson
and
miss
lacey
and
that
woman
must
be
the
principal
yes
and
girls
there
that
woman
whom
the
boys
tormented
so
on
the
train
sure
enough
there
she
was
looking
even
more
severe
now
that
her
hat
was
removed
and
her
sharp
features
were
unrelieved
if
this
is
fun
i
sorry
for
poor
esther
at
miss
graham
said
bobby
looking
about
her
with
delight
mercy
what
do
you
suppose
this
is
one
of
the
young
clerks
from
the
office
approached
the
table
a
large
cardboard
sheet
in
her
hand
i
filling
in
the
diagram
she
explained
you
must
change
your
seats
without
permission
tell
me
your
names
and
i
put
you
down
in
the
right
spaces
betty
looked
over
her
shoulder
as
she
wrote
down
their
names
like
the
diagram
of
the
seating
space
of
a
theatre
the
tables
and
chairs
were
plainly
marked
betty
swiftly
calculated
that
between
one
hundred
and
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
girls
must
be
seated
in
the
room
later
she
learned
that
the
total
enrollment
was
one
hundred
and
sixty
just
outside
the
dining
room
was
a
large
bulletin
board
impossible
to
ignore
or
overlook
when
they
came
out
from
luncheon
a
notice
was
posted
that
eustice
would
address
the
school
at
two
in
the
assembly
hall
in
the
main
building
it
was
now
let
go
look
at
the
gym
suggested
bobby
we
have
time
oh
how
do
you
do
this
last
was
apparently
jerked
out
of
her
i
did
know
you
were
coming
to
shadyside
bobby
said
ruth
gladys
royal
effusively
do
you
know
my
chum
ada
nansen
she
from
san
francisco
constance
howard
is
from
the
west
too
the
presidio
said
bobby
gracefully
she
introduced
the
others
to
ada
and
ruth
who
surveyed
them
indifferently
the
littell
girls
they
knew
were
wealthy
and
had
a
place
in
washington
society
but
the
rest
were
not
yet
classified
have
i
seen
you
before
ada
languidly
questioned
betty
you
not
the
little
waitress
oh
how
stupid
of
me
i
was
thinking
of
a
girl
who
looked
enough
like
you
to
be
your
sister
bobby
bristled
indignantly
but
betty
struggled
with
laughter
i
remember
you
she
said
clearly
you
had
the
wrong
seat
on
the
train
from
oklahoma
ada
nansen
glanced
at
her
with
positive
dislike
i
do
recall
she
said
icily
however
i
traveled
so
much
i
daresay
many
incidents
slip
my
mind
well
gladys
let
go
in
and
get
good
seats
i
want
to
hear
eustice
they
say
she
is
a
direct
descendant
of
richard
carvel
we
might
as
well
go
in
too
said
bobby
disconsolately
she
used
up
so
much
time
we
could
do
the
gym
justice
promptly
at
two
eustice
mounted
the
platform
and
tapped
a
little
bell
for
silence
the
principal
was
a
gracious
woman
of
perhaps
fifty
her
hair
was
piled
high
on
her
head
and
her
dark
eyes
were
bright
and
keen
wonderful
eyes
they
were
seeming
to
gaze
straight
into
the
youthful
eyes
that
stared
back
affectionately
or
curiously
as
the
case
might
be
eustice
gown
was
of
black
or
very
dark
blue
silk
made
simply
and
fitting
exquisitely
straight
soft
collar
and
cuffs
of
dotted
net
outlined
the
neck
and
wrists
and
her
single
ornament
was
a
tiny
watch
worn
on
a
black
ribbon
i
wish
ada
nansen
would
take
a
good
look
at
her
muttered
bobby
i
am
so
glad
to
welcome
you
my
girls
began
eustice
betty
thrilled
to
the
magic
of
that
modulated
voice
low
and
yet
clear
enough
to
be
heard
in
every
corner
of
the
large
room
surely
this
lovely
woman
could
teach
them
the
secret
of
cultivated
dignified
and
happy
young
womanhood
the
principal
spoke
to
them
briefly
of
her
ideals
for
them
explained
the
few
rigid
rules
of
the
school
and
asked
that
all
exercise
tact
and
patience
for
the
first
week
during
which
the
rough
edges
of
new
schedules
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
wear
off
i
want
to
have
a
little
personal
talk
with
each
one
of
you
she
concluded
your
corridor
teachers
will
consult
with
me
and
will
tell
you
when
you
are
to
come
to
me
and
i
hope
you
are
to
be
very
very
happy
here
with
us
at
shadyside
a
soft
clapping
of
hands
followed
this
speech
and
eustice
stepped
down
from
the
platform
to
be
instantly
surrounded
by
the
girls
who
had
spent
other
terms
at
the
school
after
the
older
girls
had
spoken
to
the
principal
the
newcomers
began
to
move
forward
they
were
presented
by
their
corridor
teachers
who
seemed
to
possess
a
special
faculty
to
remember
names
and
here
and
there
eustice
recognized
a
girl
through
the
association
of
ideas
as
miss
lacey
swept
her
girls
forward
ada
nansen
and
ruth
gladys
royal
happened
to
head
the
ranks
eustice
put
out
her
hand
to
ada
then
gazed
down
at
her
in
evident
astonishment
chapter
xii
the
lost
treasure
diamonds
whispered
betty
to
norma
guerin
who
seemed
depressed
she
wears
three
diamond
rings
and
one
sapphire
and
a
emerald
and
her
is
platinum
set
with
diamonds
eustice
gazed
at
the
soft
little
hand
she
held
for
a
few
moments
then
released
it
she
said
nothing
ah
your
mother
wrote
me
of
you
was
the
principal
greeting
to
the
littell
girls
you
look
like
her
louise
and
bobby
is
much
like
her
father
as
i
remember
him
this
is
betty
gordon
said
the
loyal
bobby
indicating
her
chum
mother
wrote
about
her
too
did
she
indeed
she
did
assented
eustice
warmly
i
must
have
a
special
talk
with
betty
soon
for
she
has
an
ambitious
program
before
her
and
here
are
libbie
and
frances
from
the
state
i
remember
so
affectionately
from
girlhood
visits
there
but
it
was
norma
and
alice
guerin
sensitive
norma
and
shy
alice
who
were
welcomed
most
cordially
after
all
so
you
are
elsie
guerin
daughters
said
the
principal
putting
an
arm
around
norma
and
holding
her
hand
out
to
alice
my
own
dear
mother
taught
your
mother
when
she
was
a
little
girl
with
braids
like
yours
and
your
dear
grandmother
used
to
give
the
most
wonderful
parties
people
talk
about
them
to
this
day
it
was
at
her
rose
ball
i
first
met
my
husband
you
must
go
up
the
north
road
some
day
and
see
the
old
macklin
house
norma
and
alice
fairly
glowed
as
they
went
back
to
their
rooms
with
the
other
girls
ada
nansen
had
heard
and
she
was
regarding
them
with
evident
respect
norma
and
alice
might
have
been
uneasy
had
they
heard
ada
comment
when
she
and
ruth
were
once
more
in
their
own
rooms
they
must
have
money
argued
ada
though
i
never
saw
such
ordinary
clothes
giving
balls
and
parties
in
the
lavish
southern
style
costs
let
me
tell
you
probably
they
have
some
fine
family
jewels
in
that
shabby
trunk
i
tell
you
what
i
think
said
ruth
gladys
wisely
i
think
the
money
is
all
used
up
probably
they
here
as
charity
pupils
for
old
friendship
sake
this
speculation
was
duly
stored
up
in
ada
nansen
mind
to
be
brought
out
when
needed
after
dinner
miss
anderson
played
for
them
to
dance
in
the
broad
hall
but
every
one
was
tired
from
train
journeys
and
at
nine
they
voluntarily
sought
their
rooms
get
into
a
kimono
and
brush
your
hair
in
here
hospitably
suggested
betty
and
bobby
seconded
her
by
flinging
the
suitcases
under
the
beds
all
of
the
rooms
were
fitted
with
pretty
so
that
a
cover
quickly
transformed
them
into
couches
and
the
bedrooms
into
sitting
rooms
four
figures
came
pattering
in
presently
and
curled
up
comfortably
on
the
beds
norma
and
alice
were
the
last
to
arrive
and
when
they
did
come
they
mystified
their
friends
by
prancing
in
silently
and
waltzing
gaily
about
the
room
oh
girls
they
chortled
when
they
had
tired
of
this
performance
what
do
you
think
we
could
help
hearing
said
norma
deprecatingly
laura
bennett
called
us
in
declared
alice
do
sing
a
duet
commanded
bobby
sternly
what
are
you
talking
about
one
at
a
time
you
tell
norma
laura
bennett
called
us
into
her
room
obediently
recited
norma
miss
lacey
was
talking
to
ada
and
ruth
you
could
hear
every
word
without
listening
that
is
without
eavesdropping
you
know
what
i
mean
eustice
must
have
spoken
to
miss
lacey
because
she
told
the
girls
they
would
have
to
send
all
the
trunks
home
except
one
apiece
ada
must
put
all
her
jewelry
in
the
school
safe
and
at
the
christmas
holidays
she
is
to
take
it
home
and
leave
it
there
both
of
them
have
to
wear
their
hair
down
or
in
a
knot
you
know
they
have
it
waved
now
and
done
up
just
like
my
mother
and
miss
lacey
is
to
go
over
their
clothes
and
tell
what
they
can
keep
i
glad
some
one
has
some
sense
was
bobby
terse
comment
something
in
norma
face
told
betty
that
she
would
like
to
speak
to
her
alone
so
half
an
hour
later
when
the
girls
had
dispersed
for
the
night
she
made
a
bent
nail
file
an
excuse
to
go
to
the
guerins
room
i
was
hoping
you
come
betty
said
norma
gratefully
we
have
to
put
out
the
lights
at
ten
do
we
i
try
to
talk
fast
you
see
alice
and
i
want
to
tell
you
something
a
fleecy
shawl
lay
across
the
bed
and
norma
flung
this
about
betty
shoulders
alice
kimono
is
flannel
and
so
is
mine
she
explained
in
answer
to
the
protest
you
never
met
grandma
macklin
did
you
betty
i
sure
i
never
did
responded
betty
thoughtfully
does
she
live
with
you
yes
but
while
you
were
at
the
peabodys
she
was
visiting
her
in
georgia
explained
norma
she
is
mother
mother
you
know
what
was
it
eustice
said
about
her
questioned
betty
with
interest
did
she
live
near
here
was
that
when
your
mother
went
to
this
school
it
was
a
day
school
then
you
know
put
in
the
laconic
alice
yes
and
grandma
lived
in
a
perfectly
wonderful
big
house
said
norma
it
must
be
fully
five
miles
from
here
uncle
goliath
an
old
colored
man
used
to
drive
her
over
every
day
and
call
for
her
in
the
afternoon
mother
has
always
been
determined
alice
and
i
should
graduate
from
shadyside
well
then
it
lovely
she
is
to
have
her
wish
commented
betty
brightly
oh
goodness
i
do
see
that
we
ever
going
to
have
four
years
confessed
norma
if
you
knew
what
they
given
up
at
home
to
send
us
for
this
term
and
though
we
would
say
anything
mother
and
grandma
worked
so
hard
to
get
us
ready
alice
and
i
are
positively
ashamed
of
our
clothes
you
see
betty
i
think
when
you
poor
you
ought
to
go
where
you
meet
other
poor
girls
alice
and
i
ought
to
have
entered
the
glenside
high
school
i
think
but
when
i
said
something
like
that
to
dad
he
said
it
would
break
mother
heart
but
if
she
knew
how
hard
it
was
to
be
poor
and
to
have
to
rub
elbows
with
girls
who
have
everything
i
do
think
you
ought
to
feel
that
way
urged
betty
you
have
something
that
no
amount
of
money
could
buy
for
you
and
no
lack
can
take
away
birth
and
breeding
and
the
training
your
mother
wants
you
to
have
is
worth
sacrificing
other
things
for
ever
since
i
heard
eustice
talk
i
feel
that
i
know
what
makes
her
school
really
successful
a
soft
tap
fell
on
the
door
lights
go
off
in
ten
minutes
girls
said
miss
lacey
pleasantly
do
you
know
betty
confessed
norma
hurriedly
dad
has
lost
quite
a
lot
of
money
lately
he
such
a
dear
he
never
can
bear
to
press
payment
of
a
bill
and
half
the
county
owes
him
and
a
friend
got
him
to
invest
what
he
did
have
in
some
silly
stock
that
never
amounted
to
a
hill
of
beans
as
the
farmers
say
so
it
no
wonder
the
macklin
fortune
worries
mother
whenever
she
thinks
of
it
a
family
like
ours
could
use
money
so
easily
most
families
are
like
that
said
betty
with
a
flash
of
uncle
humor
i
did
like
to
ask
norma
but
your
grandmother
must
have
been
wealthy
she
was
confirmed
norma
not
fabulously
so
of
course
but
even
in
those
days
when
lavish
hospitality
was
common
grandma
macklin
was
famous
for
the
way
she
ran
the
estate
she
was
left
a
widow
when
a
very
young
woman
and
mother
was
her
only
child
her
husband
did
believe
women
knew
very
much
about
money
and
he
left
his
fortune
mostly
in
bonds
and
jewels
the
most
magnificent
diamonds
in
three
counties
grandma
says
hers
were
and
she
had
a
rope
of
emeralds
and
two
strings
of
exquisitely
matched
pearls
besides
there
were
rose
topazes
and
lovely
cameos
and
oh
goodness
i
could
repeat
the
list
alice
and
i
have
been
brought
up
on
the
story
well
about
the
time
mother
had
finished
school
grandma
macklin
came
to
the
end
of
her
bank
account
several
mortgages
had
been
paid
her
in
gold
and
she
kept
this
money
with
the
jewelry
and
a
lot
of
solid
silver
in
a
little
safe
in
her
room
foolish
of
course
but
she
says
others
did
it
in
those
days
too
she
meant
to
take
the
gold
and
some
of
the
diamonds
to
her
lawyer
and
get
a
check
which
would
take
her
and
mother
around
the
world
on
a
luxurious
cruise
and
the
day
before
she
had
the
appointment
with
davies
a
soft
blackness
settled
down
over
the
girls
like
a
blanket
the
electric
lights
had
gone
out
move
closer
and
i
finish
whispered
norma
betty
snuggled
up
between
the
two
and
shivered
a
little
with
excitement
the
day
before
she
was
to
drive
to
edentown
repeated
norma
a
band
of
indians
from
the
reservation
in
the
next
state
came
through
on
their
annual
tramping
trip
and
walked
in
on
poor
little
grandma
as
she
sat
at
her
mahogany
secretary
turning
over
her
jewels
and
counting
her
beautiful
shining
gold
every
darkey
on
the
place
fled
in
terror
and
those
rascally
indians
simply
scooped
up
everything
in
sight
and
locked
grandma
and
mother
in
the
room
could
any
one
stop
them
demanded
betty
eagerly
surely
a
band
of
indians
could
have
been
easily
traced
did
any
one
try
oh
they
tried
admitted
norma
that
the
maddening
part
suppose
i
told
you
betty
that
i
know
where
grandma
inheritance
is
this
minute
chapter
xiii
the
mysterious
four
well
for
mercy
sake
said
betty
in
exasperation
if
you
know
where
the
property
is
why
do
you
claim
it
why
does
your
mother
where
is
it
at
the
bottom
of
indian
chasm
declared
norma
calmly
where
that
i
do
know
exactly
admitted
norma
it
around
here
somewhere
you
see
the
indians
streaked
for
the
woods
and
mother
got
out
by
way
of
a
window
and
ran
to
the
next
estate
the
men
and
boys
there
armed
themselves
and
took
horses
and
chased
the
redskins
and
when
they
were
almost
up
with
them
the
robbers
tossed
everything
down
this
great
canyon
in
the
earth
there
was
no
way
to
get
into
it
and
though
they
tried
lowering
men
with
ropes
they
could
find
a
solitary
gold
piece
as
far
as
any
one
knows
it
is
all
at
the
bottom
of
the
chasm
now
and
grandma
had
to
mortgage
the
house
and
they
could
pay
the
interest
and
it
was
sold
and
all
the
lovely
mahogany
furniture
mourned
alice
and
grandma
and
mother
moved
to
new
york
and
mother
taught
school
and
met
dad
who
was
a
medical
student
and
they
were
married
when
he
graduated
and
grandma
came
to
live
with
betty
crept
away
to
her
own
bed
when
the
story
was
finished
bobby
was
asleep
for
which
her
chum
was
thankful
betty
wanted
to
think
surely
there
must
be
a
way
to
recover
the
macklin
fortune
if
it
was
still
down
in
the
big
chasm
i
tell
bob
and
we
go
and
find
that
place
perhaps
he
can
think
of
a
plan
was
betty
last
thought
before
she
went
to
sleep
the
next
few
days
were
very
busy
ones
for
every
pupil
ada
and
ruth
in
tears
submitted
to
having
their
wardrobes
censored
and
thereafter
appeared
in
clothes
that
were
not
too
striking
the
appointments
with
eustice
materialized
and
betty
after
her
interview
was
conscious
of
a
sincere
affection
for
the
woman
who
seemed
to
understand
girls
so
thoroughly
bobby
was
crazy
to
quote
her
own
expression
about
the
gymnasium
classes
and
miss
anderson
beamed
approvingly
upon
her
betty
too
was
often
to
be
found
in
the
gymnasium
after
school
hours
but
libbie
had
to
be
driven
to
regular
exercise
she
liked
to
dance
but
unless
some
one
was
made
responsible
for
her
she
was
prone
to
cut
her
regular
gymnasium
period
and
devote
the
time
to
some
thrilling
novel
when
the
other
girls
discovered
this
they
made
up
a
schedule
for
the
week
assigning
a
different
day
to
every
girl
whose
duty
it
should
be
to
seal
sign
and
deliver
the
reluctant
libbie
at
the
gymnasium
door
at
the
appointed
time
eustice
rather
peculiarly
some
people
thought
ada
nansen
mother
among
them
held
the
theory
that
school
girls
should
spend
a
fair
proportion
of
their
time
in
study
she
had
small
patience
with
the
faddist
type
of
school
that
abhorred
night
work
and
whose
students
specialized
on
manners
to
the
neglect
of
spelling
i
dislike
the
term
school
she
had
once
said
i
try
to
teach
my
girls
that
what
they
learn
in
school
fits
them
for
beginning
life
so
from
seven
to
eight
every
night
except
friday
the
pupils
at
shadyside
were
busy
with
their
books
they
might
study
in
their
rooms
provided
their
marks
for
the
preceding
week
were
satisfactory
but
those
who
fell
below
a
certain
percentage
were
sentenced
to
prepare
their
lessons
in
the
study
hall
under
the
eye
of
a
teacher
the
second
friday
night
of
the
term
the
new
students
were
warned
by
little
pink
cocked
notes
to
remain
in
their
rooms
after
dinner
until
they
had
been
inspected
by
the
mysterious
four
it
a
secret
society
bobby
announced
the
moment
she
had
read
her
note
well
let
go
upstairs
and
prepare
to
be
inspected
the
eight
gathered
in
betty
and
bobby
room
and
though
they
were
expecting
it
the
knock
when
it
finally
did
come
made
them
all
jump
come
come
in
stammered
betty
and
bobby
together
four
veiled
figures
entered
each
carrying
something
in
her
hand
they
spoke
in
disguised
voices
though
as
they
were
upper
classmen
they
were
fairly
safe
from
recognition
the
new
girls
were
hardly
acquainted
among
themselves
and
knew
few
of
the
older
students
by
name
freshmen
said
the
tallest
figure
when
we
enter
rise
the
eight
leaped
to
their
feet
at
a
bound
do
you
wish
to
become
members
of
the
mysterious
four
demanded
the
second
figure
oh
yes
chorused
the
willing
victims
it
is
well
chanted
the
third
figure
it
is
well
echoed
the
fourth
i
do
said
libbie
calmly
do
what
questioned
the
tallest
figure
evidently
appointed
chief
spokesman
want
to
be
a
member
of
the
mysterious
four
announced
libbie
who
had
an
obstinate
streak
in
her
unfortunately
the
spokesman
informed
her
you
have
any
choice
in
the
matter
you
elected
one
already
while
libbie
was
thinking
up
an
answer
which
considering
the
finality
of
that
statement
was
not
an
easy
matter
the
tall
draped
figure
went
on
to
explain
to
the
interested
girls
that
there
were
two
degrees
to
be
undergone
before
one
could
be
a
full
fledged
member
of
the
mysterious
four
you
must
take
the
first
degree
they
were
told
the
second
will
be
several
weeks
later
are
we
allowed
to
ask
a
question
asked
betty
respectfully
oh
yes
but
we
may
not
answer
it
was
the
cheering
response
why
is
the
society
called
the
four
asked
betty
all
the
freshman
class
received
notes
so
the
membership
must
be
large
where
does
the
four
enter
you
learn
that
at
the
close
of
your
first
degree
said
the
spokesman
with
firm
kindness
now
you
to
remain
here
for
five
minutes
and
then
go
down
to
the
study
hall
five
minutes
remember
they
departed
majestically
and
the
girls
were
left
to
spend
their
five
minutes
in
discussion
of
the
visit
i
do
see
why
i
have
to
belong
grumbled
libbie
it
will
do
you
good
said
bobby
severely
when
i
promised
aunt
elizabeth
to
look
after
you
i
did
know
that
meant
i
would
have
to
risk
my
head
by
sleeping
under
gwendolyn
in
two
volumes
and
fat
ones
at
that
libbie
had
the
grace
to
blush
bobby
who
was
fond
of
books
but
whose
taste
ran
to
rules
for
basketball
and
how
to
gain
health
through
exercise
had
put
up
a
small
shelf
directly
over
her
bed
to
hold
her
literary
treasures
libbie
exhausting
the
space
in
her
tiny
corner
bookcase
had
thoughtlessly
placed
the
two
heavy
volumes
of
the
story
bobby
mentioned
on
top
of
her
cousin
books
with
the
awful
result
that
the
shelf
broke
in
the
night
and
spilled
the
books
on
the
wrathful
bobby
let
go
down
to
the
study
hall
suggested
louise
the
five
minutes
are
up
down
they
trooped
to
find
a
number
of
girls
already
there
for
the
most
part
looking
rather
frightened
at
five
minute
intervals
other
groups
entered
until
all
the
freshman
class
was
assembled
i
do
care
anything
about
this
society
whispered
ada
nansen
to
ruth
royal
i
would
give
fifty
cents
for
an
organization
where
no
discrimination
is
shown
in
choosing
the
members
however
this
is
eustice
pet
scheme
they
tell
me
and
i
want
to
stand
well
with
her
next
year
i
going
to
get
elected
to
the
white
scroll
you
see
if
i
do
the
mysterious
four
came
in
as
the
last
group
of
girls
were
seated
and
slowly
mounted
the
platform
candidates
announced
the
leader
you
are
summoned
here
to
take
your
first
degree
it
is
simple
but
no
shirking
is
to
be
permitted
you
are
to
do
the
one
thing
that
you
do
best
as
your
names
are
called
you
will
mount
the
platform
and
comply
four
minutes
is
allowed
for
decision
on
the
platform
there
was
a
gasp
from
the
audience
and
one
could
almost
see
the
mental
cog
wheels
of
sixty
girls
going
furiously
to
work
betty
whispered
the
desperate
bobby
what
can
you
do
best
ride
i
guess
said
betty
recollections
of
clover
coming
to
mind
there
was
a
crashing
chord
from
the
piano
one
of
the
veiled
figures
had
seated
herself
at
the
instrument
and
now
proceeded
to
play
appropriate
selections
as
the
candidates
performed
their
turns
as
the
clever
leader
had
foreseen
no
one
relished
spending
her
allotted
four
minutes
for
reflection
on
the
platform
in
full
view
of
the
audience
and
the
majority
of
the
victims
made
up
their
minds
with
a
rush
after
they
had
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
it
was
fun
and
their
shrieks
of
laughter
aroused
sympathetic
smiles
in
other
rooms
no
teachers
and
no
member
of
the
other
classes
were
permitted
to
enter
but
aunt
nancy
the
fat
cook
and
half
a
dozen
young
waitresses
peeped
in
at
the
door
and
enjoyed
the
spectacle
hugely
betty
gordon
obligingly
cantered
across
the
platform
on
a
chair
and
won
applause
by
her
realistic
interpretation
of
western
riding
bobby
convulsed
the
room
with
her
imaginary
efforts
to
cut
and
fit
a
dress
her
mistakes
being
glaring
ones
for
bobby
never
touched
a
needle
if
she
could
help
it
clever
constance
howard
had
gone
for
her
ukulele
and
played
it
charmingly
libbie
insisted
on
giving
the
balcony
scene
from
romeo
and
juliet
in
which
she
was
supported
by
the
unwilling
frances
who
was
certainly
the
stiffest
romeo
who
ever
walked
the
stage
ada
nansen
called
the
leader
when
the
eight
chums
had
made
their
individual
contributions
to
the
program
chapter
xiv
a
saturday
race
ada
had
been
watching
the
others
with
a
contempt
she
made
little
attempt
to
conceal
when
her
name
was
called
she
walked
to
the
platform
and
faced
the
leader
defiantly
what
can
you
do
best
ada
came
the
familiar
question
ada
smiled
patronizingly
spend
money
she
said
briefly
do
that
said
the
young
leader
calmly
how
can
i
spend
money
here
demanded
ada
angrily
there
nothing
to
buy
i
call
that
silly
then
you
admit
you
ca
spend
money
no
such
thing
ada
stamped
her
foot
furious
at
such
stupidity
i
say
i
ca
spend
it
here
where
there
is
nothing
to
buy
you
let
me
go
to
edentown
and
i
show
you
whether
i
can
spend
money
or
not
the
order
of
the
first
degree
of
the
mysterious
four
is
that
the
candidate
must
do
what
she
can
do
best
repeated
the
veiled
figure
insistently
what
can
you
do
best
sing
said
ada
sullenly
then
do
that
and
now
the
watching
girls
had
what
bobby
later
admitted
was
the
surprise
of
their
lives
the
girl
at
the
piano
fingered
a
chord
tentatively
then
struck
into
a
popular
song
an
appealing
little
melody
the
words
a
lyric
set
to
music
by
a
composer
with
a
spark
of
genius
i
picked
a
rose
in
my
garden
fair
sang
ada
she
sang
without
affectation
her
voice
was
a
charming
contralto
evidently
partially
trained
and
promising
with
coming
years
to
be
worth
consideration
but
it
withered
in
a
day
went
on
the
lovely
voice
the
girls
were
absolutely
mute
when
she
had
finished
the
song
and
she
gave
it
all
they
burst
into
a
spontaneous
storm
of
applause
ada
barely
acknowledged
the
her
face
had
instantly
slipped
back
into
the
old
sullen
lines
when
she
can
sing
like
that
should
you
think
she
would
be
perfectly
happy
sighed
betty
i
give
anything
if
i
had
a
voice
as
a
matter
of
fact
betty
had
a
clear
little
contralto
of
her
own
and
she
sang
as
naturally
as
a
bird
but
there
was
no
denying
that
ada
voice
was
exceptional
after
the
last
girl
had
had
her
turn
the
veiled
leader
mounted
the
platform
and
threw
back
her
swathing
net
she
the
president
of
the
senior
class
mabel
waters
whispered
a
girl
near
betty
i
have
the
honor
to
welcome
you
all
as
members
in
good
standing
of
the
novice
class
mysterious
for
announced
miss
waters
that
all
there
is
to
the
name
girls
when
we
decided
to
form
a
new
society
here
in
school
some
one
asked
it
for
so
our
organization
became
the
mysterious
and
you
find
out
as
time
goes
on
what
the
answer
is
i
might
say
though
that
happiness
and
good
fellowship
and
a
little
spice
of
sisterliness
are
what
we
try
to
incorporate
in
the
unwritten
bylaws
and
now
i
think
aunt
nancy
has
some
cake
and
for
us
saturday
was
a
busy
day
for
the
one
hundred
and
sixty
odd
girls
who
were
enrolled
at
shadyside
penance
and
pleasure
had
a
way
of
marking
off
the
hours
those
who
were
good
were
allowed
to
go
twice
a
month
to
edentown
chaperoned
by
a
teacher
for
shopping
moving
picture
treats
and
such
other
simple
pleasures
as
the
small
city
afforded
there
were
always
a
number
of
girls
sentenced
to
within
bounds
which
were
the
spacious
school
grounds
for
minor
sins
of
omission
and
commission
bobby
littell
was
usually
among
these
she
was
impulsive
and
heedless
and
got
herself
into
hot
water
with
amazing
regularity
bobby
announced
betty
one
saturday
morning
not
long
after
the
initiation
into
the
mysterious
for
do
you
think
you
could
manage
to
have
a
good
record
this
coming
week
we
want
to
go
nutting
a
week
from
and
if
you
have
to
stay
in
bounds
it
will
spoil
all
the
fun
i
try
my
best
promised
bobby
solemnly
i
never
mean
to
do
a
thing
betty
trouble
is
i
think
afterward
i
did
want
to
go
to
edentown
too
but
libbie
and
frances
have
promised
to
get
the
wool
for
my
sweater
want
to
come
down
to
the
gym
i
going
to
drill
my
squad
this
morning
in
the
gymnasium
they
found
ada
nansen
also
in
charge
of
a
squad
she
flunked
twice
in
french
and
was
impudent
to
madame
whispered
bobby
who
knew
all
the
school
gossip
eustice
canceled
her
edentown
permit
ada
frankly
scowled
at
the
newcomers
she
had
found
the
littell
girls
slow
to
overtures
of
friendship
and
they
persisted
in
displaying
an
annoying
fancy
for
the
society
of
betty
and
the
guerin
girls
who
for
all
ada
knew
might
be
what
she
described
to
her
mother
as
perfect
nobodies
so
ada
and
ruth
royal
gradually
formed
a
circle
of
their
own
to
which
gravitated
the
more
snobbish
girls
those
who
fought
openly
or
covertly
the
rule
for
simple
dressing
and
those
who
found
in
characteristics
of
petty
meanness
worship
of
money
and
social
aspirations
a
response
to
similar
urgings
of
their
own
natures
well
bobby
i
glad
to
see
you
and
your
said
miss
anderson
briskly
i
was
just
saying
to
ada
that
is
too
beautiful
to
waste
indoors
i
want
you
all
to
come
out
on
the
campus
and
we
have
a
race

squad
included
betty
who
had
refused
to
leave
her
chum
the
guerin
girls
who
refused
to
go
to
edentown
because
it
was
almost
impossible
to
avoid
spending
money
for
little
luxuries
and
for
treats
constance
howard
and
dora
estabrooke
a
fat
girl
who
was
itself
we
have
to
use
elimination
said
the
teacher
when
she
had
her
pupils
out
on
the
green
level
that
was
back
of
the
gymnasium
and
walled
in
by
tall
lombardy
poplars
planted
closely
let
see
twelve
of
you
for
ada
squad
numbered
the
same
i
think
we
number
off
first
the
odd
numbers
in
each
squad
fell
out
and
were
matched
and
the
even
numbers
were
paired
similarly
betty
rival
was
a
girl
who
delayed
the
next
step
because
miss
anderson
discovered
that
she
was
wearing
shoes
i
do
care
for
those
flat
things
volunteered
violet
canby
as
she
departed
lockerward
at
miss
anderson
stern
insistence
i
have
a
very
high
instep
and
they
hurt
me
nevertheless
she
had
to
wear
them
and
the
physical
instructor
put
the
others
through
a
rigid
inspection
but
bloomers
and
sneakers
were
all
properly
donned
now
said
miss
anderson
when
violet
had
returned
minus
her
pumps
try
to
remember
that
it
just
like
a
spelling
match
girls
gradually
narrow
down
to
the
two
best
runners
the
trial
heats
resulted
in
leaving
betty
bobby
and
norma
of
the
one
squad
and
ada
ruth
and
a
girl
named
edith
harrison
of
the
other
norma
was
paired
with
ruth
royal
and
at
the
signal
they
got
away
nicely
norma
was
an
excellent
runner
and
she
reached
the
tape
fully
three
yards
ahead
of
ruth
something
in
her
glowing
happy
face
prompted
ruth
to
resentment
oh
well
she
remarked
disdainfully
taking
care
that
her
words
should
carry
clearly
i
suppose
a
farmer
daughter
does
a
good
deal
of
running
after
cows
they
ought
to
be
in
training
norma
flushed
scarlet
my
father
is
a
doctor
she
said
hotly
i
not
a
farmer
daughter
but
i
know
splendid
girls
who
are
girls
too
to
say
a
thing
like
that
ruth
walked
away
she
was
out
of
the
finals
now
and
norma
went
back
to
the
starting
place
she
had
not
recovered
her
poise
when
the
time
came
for
her
to
race
bobby
and
that
young
person
won
easily
only
to
be
outdistanced
by
betty
rather
to
the
latter
regret
she
found
herself
the
opponent
of
ada
for
the
deciding
race
go
it
betty
beat
her
whispered
bobby
proud
of
her
chum
she
and
ruth
royal
have
dispositions
like
vinegar
barrels
betty
had
often
raced
with
bob
and
she
ran
like
a
boy
herself
head
down
elbows
held
in
she
was
running
that
way
against
ada
when
something
suddenly
shunted
her
off
sideways
she
fell
landing
in
a
little
heap
high
and
sharp
rose
the
shrill
whistle
of
the
starter
are
you
hurt
betty
demanded
miss
anderson
running
up
to
the
dazed
girl
and
lifting
her
to
her
feet
ada
nansen
that
was
absolutely
the
most
unsportsmanlike
trick
i
ever
saw
you
lost
the
race
on
a
foul
betty
was
clearly
winning
when
you
tripped
her
i
did
muttered
ada
but
she
refused
to
meet
her
teacher
eyes
i
do
want
a
race
on
a
foul
argued
betty
pluckily
for
her
skinned
elbow
was
smarting
madly
let
begin
over
she
had
her
way
too
and
this
time
won
without
interference
though
ada
was
so
furious
that
bobby
was
seriously
concerned
she
looks
mad
enough
to
put
something
in
your
soup
she
told
betty
as
they
went
in
to
dress
and
have
betty
elbow
attended
to
what
is
it
caroline
two
young
gentlemen
to
see
you
miss
bobby
and
miss
betty
announced
the
maid
importantly
they
is
waiting
in
the
parlor
eustice
says
you
all
should
go
right
up
in
the
parlor
the
girls
found
two
slim
uniformed
young
figures
who
rose
like
ramrods
at
their
entrance
bob
ejaculated
betty
her
voice
betraying
her
pleasure
bob
you
look
splendid
tommy
tucker
glanced
hopefully
at
bobby
do
i
look
splendid
too
he
asked
you
overshadowed
by
bob
said
bobby
mischievously
however
when
not
compared
with
him
i
dare
say
you
look
rather
well
chapter
xv
norma
makes
repairs
this
had
to
content
the
tucker
twin
who
took
bobby
chaffing
bob
henderson
did
indeed
look
very
well
the
uniform
was
most
becoming
and
though
he
was
studying
hard
to
make
up
for
lack
of
preparation
his
clear
eyes
and
skin
and
firm
muscles
told
of
a
wise
schedule
that
included
plenty
of
outdoor
exercise
we
want
you
girls
to
come
over
to
a
practice
game
announced
tommy
tucker
presently
we
got
rather
jolly
rooms
and
we
thought
if
you
brought
miss
thingumbob
along
we
could
have
you
in
for
tea
and
show
you
the
sights
do
you
think
the
powers
that
be
will
say
yes
well
i
do
know
answered
betty
thoughtfully
i
did
know
you
salsette
boys
had
much
to
do
with
girls
of
course
the
whole
school
goes
to
the
big
football
games
but
asking
us
to
see
a
practice
game
is
something
new
of
course
it
will
be
difficult
to
get
an
afternoon
when
every
one
is
free
every
one
exploded
bob
who
said
anything
about
every
one
we
want
the
whole
school
just
you
and
bobby
and
louise
and
frances
and
libbie
and
the
guerin
girls
sure
the
same
bunch
that
came
up
on
the
train
said
tommy
tucker
lead
me
to
eustice
and
i
ask
her
eustice
is
not
in
this
afternoon
announced
an
extremely
cold
and
disapproving
voice
have
you
permission
young
ladies
to
see
these
er
callers
it
was
the
elderly
teacher
whom
tommy
had
tormented
on
the
train
for
once
in
his
life
that
young
man
was
thoroughly
abashed
he
threw
betty
an
appealing
look
that
asked
her
to
save
him
miss
prettyman
may
i
present
my
friends
said
the
girl
with
the
formality
that
is
subtly
flattering
to
an
older
woman
this
is
bob
henderson
who
came
from
the
west
with
me
and
who
is
really
like
my
brother
since
my
uncle
is
his
guardian
and
this
is
tommy
tucker
who
lives
in
washington
how
do
you
do
robert
and
thomas
said
miss
prettyman
austerely
did
eustice
know
you
had
callers
she
persisted
turning
to
the
girls
she
took
the
last
bus
to
edentown
yes
she
knew
it
is
all
right
caroline
said
so
babbled
betty
in
frantic
terror
lest
the
boys
make
the
mistake
of
telling
miss
prettyman
about
the
proposed
visit
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
ask
eustice
young
man
the
teacher
demanded
next
i
am
her
secretary
and
try
to
save
her
work
whenever
possible
perhaps
i
can
answer
your
question
behind
miss
prettyman
narrow
back
betty
signaled
wildly
do
tell
hush
she
laying
her
finger
against
her
lips
tommy
stared
at
her
idiotically
his
mouth
gaping
thank
you
but
only
eustice
could
really
give
us
an
answer
said
bob
coming
to
the
rescue
of
his
stricken
chum
betty
will
you
deliver
our
message
and
perhaps
you
can
telephone
the
answer
no
shadyside
girl
is
allowed
to
telephone
salsette
academy
announced
miss
prettyman
with
grim
satisfaction
betty
had
not
known
of
this
rule
but
she
realized
it
was
undoubtedly
in
existence
we
let
you
know
some
way
she
promised
still
pursued
by
miss
prettyman
icy
glare
the
wretched
boys
backed
out
of
the
room
and
the
unfortunate
tommy
walked
into
a
handsome
china
jardiniere
with
disastrous
results
there
was
a
sickening
crash
a
ladylike
scream
from
miss
prettyman
and
betty
heard
bob
voice
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
fury
you
done
it
now
you
idiot
bobby
giggled
of
course
but
miss
prettyman
who
had
followed
the
boys
into
the
hall
i
think
she
thought
we
steal
something
on
the
way
out
bob
confided
later
to
betty
maintained
her
poise
i
i
awfully
sorry
faltered
the
culprit
i
hope
it
was
very
expensive
i
pay
eustice
of
course
or
buy
her
another
one
that
jardiniere
happened
to
be
imported
from
nippon
remarked
miss
prettyman
coldly
i
doubt
if
it
can
ever
be
replaced
it
has
stood
in
that
exact
spot
for
seven
years
but
then
naturally
our
callers
are
accustomed
to
leaving
a
room
gracefully
i
sure
i
the
agonized
tommy
tried
to
get
in
a
word
failed
and
took
a
step
toward
the
door
his
foot
caught
in
the
rug
and
for
one
dreadful
moment
he
thought
he
was
doomed
to
create
another
scene
as
he
recovered
his
balance
ada
nansen
came
down
the
stairs
what
was
that
noise
we
heard
a
few
minutes
ago
she
asked
sweetly
looking
at
the
boys
betty
and
bobby
laughing
in
the
doorway
of
the
reception
room
the
unyielding
miss
prettyman
and
the
cool
and
curious
ada
swam
before
tommy
eyes
bob
retained
his
presence
of
mind
and
opening
the
door
with
one
hand
and
pushing
tommy
before
him
with
the
other
managed
to
effect
their
exit
gosh
bob
was
that
awful
sighed
poor
tommy
when
they
were
finally
clear
of
the
school
portal
do
i
always
have
bad
luck
how
could
i
know
we
were
going
to
walk
smack
into
that
dame
she
remembered
us
too
she
remembered
you
said
bob
significantly
and
you
were
within
one
of
asking
her
to
let
the
girls
come
over
to
the
game
too
did
you
know
you
poor
fish
that
she
would
jump
for
joy
if
she
could
have
a
chance
to
turn
you
down
well
anyway
replied
tommy
more
contentedly
betty
will
let
us
know
she
can
find
a
way
betty
lost
no
time
in
putting
the
invitation
before
eunice
when
she
returned
from
her
town
expedition
the
principal
knew
all
about
bob
through
gordon
letters
and
those
from
littell
and
she
knew
most
of
the
parents
of
the
other
lads
betty
mentioned
i
see
no
reason
my
dear
she
said
graciously
when
she
heard
of
the
morning
visit
why
you
should
not
go
get
the
consent
of
your
chaperone
and
then
settle
on
the
afternoon
how
many
of
you
are
invited
seven
answered
betty
truthfully
but
i
want
constance
howard
to
go
eustice
the
boys
did
know
about
her
she
is
louise
roommate
you
see
and
we
eight
always
do
everything
together
all
right
constance
may
go
too
acquiesced
eustice
betty
thanked
her
warmly
and
danced
off
to
find
bobby
then
they
flew
to
ask
miss
anderson
to
be
their
chaperone
a
duty
that
young
woman
assumed
cordially
and
before
bedtime
betty
had
written
bob
a
note
to
say
that
they
would
be
over
friday
afternoon
about
four
watched
a
little
enviously
by
the
others
the
eight
piled
into
the
school
bus
the
next
friday
afternoon
miss
anderson
tripped
down
the
steps
took
her
place
among
them
and
they
were
off
did
you
see
that
lovely
blouse
ada
had
on
norma
guerin
whispered
to
betty
i
do
wish
i
could
have
one
like
that
to
wear
with
my
suit
you
look
fifty
times
prettier
than
she
does
flared
betty
loyally
and
you
know
i
told
you
to
borrow
anything
of
mine
whenever
you
want
to
i
know
it
admitted
norma
but
i
ca
borrow
clothes
silly
or
not
i
just
ca
seem
to
i
do
mean
to
complain
all
the
time
either
but
i
do
believe
mother
or
granny
realized
how
difficult
it
was
going
to
be
alice
cried
so
hard
this
afternoon
when
she
started
to
get
dressed
i
thought
she
never
get
her
eyes
right
again
they
look
red
yet
sure
enough
alice
eyes
were
suspiciously
pink
about
the
corners
betty
knew
that
the
guerin
girls
were
unhappy
not
alone
because
they
could
not
have
as
many
or
as
pretty
frocks
as
the
other
girls
but
because
they
were
constantly
worried
about
financial
affairs
at
home
they
had
both
been
made
the
confidantes
of
their
parents
to
a
greater
degree
than
is
customary
in
many
families
and
betty
shrewdly
suspected
that
norma
had
kept
her
father
books
for
him
i
wish
i
could
get
hold
of
that
treasure
or
a
part
of
it
betty
thought
is
it
maddening
to
think
of
a
string
of
pearls
at
the
bottom
of
a
chasm
and
the
girls
to
whom
it
should
go
struggling
along
on
next
to
nothing
they
were
around
the
lake
when
the
motor
slowed
down
and
the
bus
stopped
what
the
matter
george
miss
anderson
asked
do
know
answered
the
driver
a
rather
man
guess
i
have
to
investigate
her
scratching
his
head
he
proceeded
to
investigate
and
at
the
end
of
fifteen
minutes
hazarded
an
opinion
that
they
were
out
of
luck
looks
like
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
school
garage
and
get
to
send
us
a
tow
he
announced
pleasantly
we
want
to
go
to
the
academy
chorused
the
girls
we
late
now
oh
george
ca
you
fix
it
betty
do
you
know
anything
about
cars
appealed
miss
anderson
who
had
discovered
that
betty
was
apt
to
be
invaluable
in
an
emergency
of
any
kind
betty
had
to
confess
that
her
experience
had
been
confined
to
horses
the
littell
girls
had
been
used
to
cars
all
their
lives
but
like
the
majority
of
such
fortunates
knew
nothing
about
them
beyond
the
colors
suitable
for
upholstery
i
helped
my
dad
with
his
car
ventured
norma
diffidently
this
is
the
same
make
but
perhaps
i
can
tell
what
the
matter
is
the
beautiful
expensive
school
bus
was
in
fact
another
type
than
the
shabby
rattly
affair
guerin
made
spin
over
the
rough
country
roads
however
betty
remembered
at
least
one
night
and
she
knew
her
experience
had
been
duplicated
by
many
others
when
the
noise
of
the
asthmatic
little
car
had
been
like
sweetest
music
in
her
ears
the
doctor
daughter
took
off
her
plain
jacket
rolled
back
her
white
cuffs
and
bent
over
the
engine
george
regarded
her
respectfully
and
miss
anderson
and
the
girls
watched
anxiously
if
norma
could
not
send
them
on
their
way
it
meant
the
trip
must
be
given
up
norma
put
her
slim
hands
down
among
the
oily
plugs
selected
a
tool
from
the
kit
george
held
out
to
her
and
did
something
mysterious
to
the
innards
start
her
she
commanded
briefly
obediently
george
took
the
wheel
and
touched
the
the
engine
purred
contentedly
by
gum
cried
george
inelegantly
she
done
it
he
produced
a
towel
from
the
box
for
norma
who
managed
to
rub
off
most
of
the
grease
from
her
hands
she
put
on
her
jacket
and
climbed
into
her
place
between
betty
and
her
sister
george
proceeded
to
make
up
for
lost
time
at
a
speed
that
left
them
breathless
here
the
girl
who
got
us
here
said
betty
to
bob
when
the
group
of
cadets
met
their
bus
at
the
athletic
field
where
several
cars
were
drawn
up
on
the
sidelines
then
she
shall
have
my
fur
coat
and
my
best
curly
chrysanthemum
announced
tommy
tucker
gallantly
throwing
a
handsome
raccoon
fur
coat
over
norma
shoulders
and
presenting
her
with
a
magnificent
yellow
chrysanthemum
chapter

the
nutting
party
to
the
boy
surprise
bobby
who
was
usually
aloof
and
liked
to
tease
him
squeezed
his
arm
surreptitiously
you
a
dear
she
told
him
enthusiastically
girls
are
a
queer
lot
the
dazed
youth
confided
to
bob
as
they
went
back
to
their
quarters
here
i
handed
over
my
coat
to
that
norma
guerin
and
gave
her
the
flower
i
been
saving
for
bobby
just
to
pay
bobby
back
for
being
so
snippy
to
me
over
at
school
and
she
calls
me
a
dear
and
is
nicer
to
me
than
she
been
in
months
bob
briefly
outlined
something
of
the
guerin
history
for
betty
had
told
him
of
the
lost
treasure
in
her
hurried
note
and
hinted
his
belief
that
the
girls
had
very
little
money
in
comparison
to
shadyside
standards
shucks
money
is
anything
was
tommy
answer
to
the
recital
with
the
easy
assurance
of
a
person
who
has
never
been
without
a
comfortable
competence
they
nice
girls
and
we
pass
the
word
that
the
boys
are
to
show
them
a
good
time
as
a
result
when
after
the
conclusion
of
the
game
the
girls
and
miss
anderson
were
ushered
upstairs
into
the
cozy
suite
of
rooms
the
cadets
occupied
norma
and
alice
found
themselves
plied
with
attentions
miss
anderson
poured
the
hot
chocolate
and
made
friends
with
the
shy
sydney
cooke
who
had
been
dreading
this
visit
all
the
afternoon
indeed
his
chums
had
threatened
to
lock
him
in
the
clothes
closet
in
order
that
they
might
be
sure
of
his
attendance
winifred
marion
brown
in
addition
to
his
ability
as
a
checker
player
was
a
good
pianist
and
he
obligingly
played
for
them
to
dance
the
piano
belonged
to
the
tucker
twins
norma
and
alice
were
rushed
with
partners
and
they
quite
forgot
their
clothes
in
the
enjoyment
of
dancing
to
irresistible
music
libbie
had
brought
a
book
of
poems
for
timothy
derby
who
solemnly
loaned
her
one
of
his
in
exchange
this
odd
pair
remained
impervious
to
all
criticisms
and
certainly
many
of
those
voiced
were
frank
to
the
point
of
painfulness
but
their
natures
can
not
understand
the
lyric
appeal
said
libbie
sadly
her
english
teacher
moaned
over
her
spelling
and
rejoiced
in
her
themes
finally
miss
anderson
insisted
they
must
go
and
the
bouquet
of
flowers
on
the
tea
table
was
plucked
apart
to
reveal
nine
little
individual
bouquets
one
for
each
guest
and
thank
you
for
a
lovely
party
said
miss
anderson
gaily
do
you
know
blurted
teddy
tucker
you
my
idea
of
a
chaperone
most
of
are
such
dubs
and
which
tactful
speech
proved
to
be
the
best
teddy
could
have
made
a
week
of
small
pleasures
and
hard
study
followed
this
glorious
friday
afternoon
bobby
for
a
wonder
remembered
her
promise
of
good
behavior
and
by
herculean
effort
managed
to
be
on
the
starred
list
for
the
saturday
set
aside
for
the
nutting
expedition
we
go
after
lunch
planned
betty
miss
anderson
says
if
we
strike
off
toward
the
woods
at
the
back
of
the
school
we
ought
to
come
to
a
grove
of
hickory
nut
trees
the
eight
girls
ready
for
their
tramp
came
in
to
lunch
attired
in
heavy
wool
skirts
and
stout
shoes
and
carried
their
sweaters
ada
nansen
glanced
complacently
at
her
own
suede
pumps
and
silk
stockings
it
hard
to
tell
which
is
really
the
farmer
daughter
she
drawled
perhaps
we
all
ought
to
assume
that
uniform
out
of
kindness
ada
sat
at
the
table
directly
behind
norma
and
not
a
girl
at
either
table
could
possibly
miss
the
significance
of
her
remarks
their
import
it
developed
had
been
plain
to
miss
lacey
who
on
her
way
to
her
own
table
had
overheard
miss
lacey
was
a
quiet
rather
drab
little
woman
misleading
in
her
effacement
of
self
she
knew
more
about
her
pupils
than
they
often
suspected
ada
she
said
quietly
stopping
by
the
girl
you
may
leave
the
table
if
you
will
persist
in
acting
like
a
naughty
little
six
year
old
girl
you
must
be
treated
as
one
ada
flounced
out
of
her
chair
and
from
the
room
her
departure
created
a
ripple
of
curiosity
it
was
most
unusual
for
a
girl
to
be
dismissed
from
table
and
had
ada
only
known
it
she
had
drawn
the
attention
of
the
whole
school
to
herself
miss
lacey
went
on
to
her
seat
without
a
glance
at
the
flushed
faces
of
norma
and
alice
some
day
said
bobby
furiously
i
going
to
throw
a
plate
at
that
girl
no
you
not
contradicted
betty
then
eustice
would
rise
up
and
send
you
from
the
room
and
you
feel
about
half
the
size
ada
does
now
for
mercy
sake
do
descend
to
anybody
level
make
come
up
to
fight
on
yours
they
were
all
glad
to
get
through
the
meal
and
find
themselves
outdoors
it
was
a
perfect
autumn
day
warm
and
hazy
and
the
red
and
gold
of
the
leaves
showed
burnished
from
the
hillside
they
tramped
rather
silently
at
first
and
then
as
the
tense
mood
wore
off
their
tongues
were
loosened
and
they
chattered
like
magpies
here
a
tree
shouted
louise
and
frances
who
were
in
the
lead
when
they
had
picked
all
the
nuts
on
the
ground
bobby
essayed
to
climb
the
tree
she
made
rather
sad
work
of
the
effort
for
a
hickory
is
not
the
easiest
tree
in
the
world
to
climb
and
after
she
had
torn
her
skirt
in
two
places
and
mended
it
with
safety
pins
she
gave
up
the
attempt
let
walk
further
she
suggested
we
mark
our
trail
as
we
go
like
the
indians
this
idea
caught
the
fancy
of
the
girls
and
they
marked
an
elaborate
trail
building
little
mounds
at
every
turn
and
leaving
odd
arrangements
of
stones
to
mark
their
passing
come
on
i
race
you
shouted
bobby
suddenly
i
feel
just
like
exercising
betty
wondered
what
she
called
the
scramble
through
the
woods
but
she
too
was
ready
for
a
run
they
set
off
pellmell
laughing
and
shouting
look
out
shrieked
betty
stopping
so
suddenly
that
libbie
and
louise
fell
against
her
look
i
almost
ran
right
into
it
she
pointed
ahead
to
where
the
ground
fell
away
abruptly
a
great
chasm
like
an
angry
scar
was
cut
through
the
earth
and
on
the
side
opposite
to
the
girls
a
steep
hill
came
down
in
an
uncompromising
slant
what
a
dandy
hill
for
coasting
ejaculated
bobby
let
come
up
here
this
winter
we
can
steer
away
from
this
hole
that
no
hole
said
norma
guerin
in
an
odd
voice
that
indian
chasm
and
it
miles
long
betty
stared
at
her
she
had
thought
indian
chasm
many
miles
away
i
did
realize
we
had
walked
so
far
said
norma
apparently
reading
her
thoughts
but
i
know
i
am
right
here
are
the
woods
and
the
steep
hill
just
as
grandma
has
described
them
a
hundred
times
this
is
indian
chasm
the
girls
looked
at
her
curiously
betty
had
not
told
them
the
story
believing
that
alice
and
norma
should
have
that
sole
right
now
norma
rapidly
sketched
the
outlines
for
them
and
they
listened
breathlessly
for
surely
this
true
story
was
more
thrilling
than
any
piece
of
fiction
however
highly
colored
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
romantic
was
libbie
comment
to
which
bobby
retorted
with
cousinly
severity
romantic
where
do
you
see
anything
romantic
in
a
band
of
indians
scalping
a
peaceful
white
family
oh
bobby
protested
norma
laughing
they
did
scalp
grandma
they
stole
everything
she
had
and
is
all
that
stuff
down
there
now
asked
constance
howard
perhaps
if
we
look
we
can
see
something
there
was
a
concerted
rush
to
the
chasm
edge
and
the
eight
girls
plumped
down
flat
on
their
stomachs
determined
to
see
whatever
there
was
to
be
seen
the
sides
of
the
earth
fell
away
sharply
down
down
betty
shouted
and
the
empty
echo
of
her
voice
came
back
to
her
the
ground
so
shaly
and
crumbly
she
said
thoughtfully
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
let
a
man
down
with
a
rope
the
earth
would
cave
in
and
bury
him
i
think
i
see
a
diamond
reported
libbie
do
you
see
something
glittering
down
there
ca
even
see
the
bottom
said
bobby
curtly
much
less
a
diamond
oh
girls
to
think
of
those
valuables
at
the
bottom
of
a
chasm
like
this
and
none
of
us
able
to
think
up
a
way
to
get
out
well
lots
of
people
have
tried
said
alice
reasonably
if
men
could
salvage
for
grandma
i
guess
it
nothing
to
our
discredit
that
we
ca
get
them
we
might
push
libbie
in
suggested
bobby
wickedly
then
she
could
tell
us
how
deep
it
is
this
had
the
effect
of
sending
libbie
scurrying
away
from
the
dangerous
place
and
the
others
followed
her
more
slowly
to
resume
the
search
for
nuts
i
wish
we
could
think
of
a
way
norma
dear
said
betty
oh
i
do
care
not
so
very
much
answered
norma
bravely
but
then
she
sighed
deeply
chapter
xvii
caught
in
the
storm
the
shadyside
gymnasium
was
equipped
with
a
fine
pool
and
it
was
the
school
boast
that
every
girl
learned
to
swim
during
her
first
term
perhaps
the
proximity
of
the
lake
and
the
lure
of
the
small
fleet
of
canoes
and
rowboats
tied
up
at
the
wharf
had
something
to
do
with
the
success
of
the
swimming
classes
no
girl
who
could
not
swim
was
permitted
on
the
lake
alone
or
with
a
companion
betty
and
her
chums
awaited
their
final
tests
eagerly
so
excited
the
last
day
or
two
they
could
scarcely
keep
their
minds
on
their
books
or
sit
in
patience
through
a
recitation
and
passed
them
with
flying
colors
constance
howard
was
an
excellent
swimmer
and
it
was
the
sight
of
her
paddling
gracefully
about
the
lake
on
sunny
saturday
afternoons
that
spurred
the
seven
who
could
not
swim
on
to
greater
effort
come
on
cried
betty
gaily
taking
the
gymnasium
steps
two
at
a
time
come
girls
this
afternoon
we
go
rowing
i
my
as
peabody
used
to
call
it
and
we
all
passed
oh
it
cloudy
she
looked
at
the
sky
disappointedly
when
they
had
gone
into
the
pool
an
hour
before
the
sun
had
been
shining
brightly
but
now
the
gray
clouds
were
thick
overhead
and
the
air
was
chilly
who
cares
for
the
weather
said
bobby
scornfully
guess
it
will
take
more
than
a
little
rain
to
stop
me
i
been
crazy
to
take
a
out
for
three
weeks
perhaps
it
will
clear
contributed
the
optimistic
louise
but
after
lunch
the
sky
was
still
overcast
do
be
silly
it
wo
rain
urged
bobby
as
her
chums
demurred
next
saturday
it
may
be
too
cold
oh
come
on
girls
thus
incited
they
went
down
to
the
wharf
and
made
their
choice
of
boats
norma
and
alice
wanted
to
take
out
a
canoe
and
they
offered
to
paddle
for
libbie
who
seemed
disinclined
to
exercise
betty
had
wondered
once
or
twice
if
the
girl
were
ill
for
she
seemed
very
nervous
jumped
if
a
door
slammed
or
some
one
spoke
to
her
suddenly
and
in
the
morning
looked
as
if
she
had
not
slept
well
betty
and
bobby
selected
a
and
for
passenger
they
took
frances
who
offered
to
help
row
if
they
became
tired
louise
and
constance
chose
another
canoe
they
headed
north
and
once
out
in
the
center
of
the
lake
paddled
and
rowed
steadily
betty
rowing
experience
was
limited
but
bobby
was
proud
of
her
stroke
and
soon
taught
her
chum
the
secret
of
handling
the
oars
ship
ahoy
shouted
bobby
presently
libbie
jumped
and
looked
ahead
anxiously
it
only
the
boys
she
said
dully
an
rowing
shell
shot
down
to
them
and
the
coxswain
gilbert
lane
one
of
the
boys
the
girls
had
met
at
bob
and
tommy
party
grinned
cheerfully
where
you
going
he
asked
resting
a
friendly
hand
on
the
rowboat
rim
bobby
described
an
arc
with
her
oar
that
incidentally
showered
the
questioner
with
shining
water
drops
we
out
for
adventure
she
answered
airily
just
got
our
swimming
certificates
volunteered
betty
bob
flashed
her
a
congratulatory
smile
race
you
to
the
end
of
the
lake
suggested
tommy
tucker
bobby
regarded
him
with
magnificent
scorn
as
if
eight
of
you
could
beat
two
she
said
significantly
i
never
heard
such
talk
why
you
have
a
walk
she
added
the
boys
shouted
with
laughter
you
a
poet
bobby
declared
tommy
tennyson
had
nothing
on
you
had
he
libbie
libbie
turned
her
dark
eyes
on
him
and
frowned
a
little
i
was
listening
she
said
indifferently
well
anyway
row
up
to
the
end
of
the
lake
will
you
suggested
gilbert
with
drill
night
ahead
of
us
we
want
a
little
brightness
to
remember
the
day
by
canoes
rowboat
and
shell
swept
on
up
the
lake
and
when
the
scrubby
pines
that
bordered
the
narrow
peak
of
the
north
shore
were
in
sight
bobby
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder
at
betty
you
spattering
me
she
complained
i
thinks
it
beginning
to
rain
said
betty
mildly
and
even
as
she
spoke
louise
called
to
them
girls
it
beginning
to
pour
a
sudden
blast
of
wind
struck
them
blowing
the
rain
against
their
backs
keep
on
rowing
shouted
bob
voice
we
have
to
land
and
walk
back
you
girls
can
never
beat
back
against
this
storm
we
almost
to
the
shore
now
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
boats
touched
shore
the
boys
were
out
in
an
instant
and
helped
the
girls
to
land
we
carry
up
the
boats
do
you
think
that
is
best
tommy
shouted
bob
if
we
carry
them
up
high
enough
and
leave
them
they
will
be
perfectly
safe
the
wind
and
the
rain
made
shouting
necessary
if
one
voice
were
to
carry
above
the
storm
the
boys
lifted
the
light
boats
and
carried
them
into
the
woods
turning
them
over
so
that
the
keels
were
up
now
the
question
is
said
bob
who
seemed
by
common
consent
to
have
been
elected
leader
shall
we
walk
along
the
shore
and
get
drenched
or
take
a
chance
of
finding
our
way
through
the
woods
to
their
astonishment
libbie
burst
into
a
fit
of
hysterical
weeping
do
go
through
the
woods
she
begged
her
teeth
chattering
fall
into
that
awful
indian
chasm
bobby
heart
reproached
her
for
her
thoughtless
joke
and
she
put
an
arm
around
her
cousin
libbie
you
never
thought
i
was
serious
about
pushing
you
into
the
chasm
did
you
she
asked
anxiously
is
that
what
has
been
making
you
act
so
queerly
ever
since
i
was
only
fooling
so
thought
betty
bobby
too
had
noticed
libbie
unnatural
behavior
oh
it
is
that
sobbed
libbie
i
ca
explain
but
if
we
go
through
the
woods
i
sure
i
shall
go
crazy
well
then
that
settles
it
said
bob
comfortably
better
to
be
drowned
than
to
go
crazy
can
you
turn
up
your
sweater
collars
girls
i
wish
we
brought
some
raincoats
along
splashing
and
stumbling
they
followed
bob
down
to
the
shore
and
began
the
weary
walk
that
would
lead
them
back
to
the
school
after
fifteen
minutes
steady
walking
they
came
to
a
dense
undergrowth
that
was
impossible
to
penetrate
no
use
we
have
to
make
a
cut
through
the
woods
announced
bob
up
this
way
and
over
ought
to
bring
us
out
right
he
was
so
cheerful
and
patient
that
the
tired
girls
could
not
do
otherwise
than
follow
his
example
libbie
was
crying
silently
but
the
others
tramped
along
cheerfully
singing
at
betty
suggestion
old
college
and
school
songs
look
here
bob
said
tommy
tucker
in
an
undertone
i
do
think
going
in
the
right
direction
do
you
say
it
would
be
better
to
take
the
girls
to
that
deserted
cabin
we
found
the
other
day
and
leave
them
there
while
we
explore
a
bit
they
getting
soaked
through
and
libbie
littell
is
fixing
to
have
hysterics
leave
a
couple
of
the
boys
with
so
they
wo
be
afraid
and
then
we
locate
the
right
trail
and
take
over
it
home
in
a
hurry
this
suggestion
sounded
like
good
to
bob
and
he
said
so
betty
could
walk
ten
miles
and
be
all
right
he
declared
proudly
and
i
think
bobby
is
good
for
a
hike
too
but
frances
martin
ca
see
when
the
rain
gets
on
her
glasses
and
as
you
say
something
is
the
matter
with
libbie
so
let
make
for
the
cabin
quick
the
salsette
boys
had
explored
the
woods
pretty
thoroughly
and
on
a
recent
expedition
bob
and
his
chums
had
stumbled
on
an
old
cabin
buried
deep
in
the
woods
and
evidently
unoccupied
for
years
it
was
not
far
from
the
end
of
the
lake
and
toward
it
they
now
led
the
girls
explaining
as
they
went
what
they
intended
to
do
we
be
all
right
said
betty
at
once
i
think
if
libbie
can
sit
down
and
rest
she
feel
better
too
and
if
you
all
want
to
go
and
hunt
for
the
trail
you
need
worry
about
us
oh
sydney
and
i
intend
to
stay
gilbert
lane
assured
her
quickly
the
boys
had
settled
that
among
themselves
we
be
handy
in
case
any
indians
or
the
like
come
after
you
betty
gave
him
a
warning
glance
for
libbie
looked
frightened
surely
something
was
wrong
with
the
girl
the
cabin
door
was
open
and
the
interior
was
comparatively
dry
there
was
no
furniture
but
three
or
four
old
packing
boxes
furnished
the
girls
with
seats
bob
and
five
of
his
friends
disappeared
whistling
gilbert
and
sydney
were
investigating
the
ramshackle
fireplace
to
see
what
the
prospects
were
for
starting
a
fire
when
a
shriek
from
libbie
brought
them
to
their
feet
a
ghost
cried
the
girl
a
ghost
over
there
in
the
corner
frances
martin
gave
a
cry
and
betty
and
bobby
went
white
even
gilbert
afterward
confessed
that
his
scalp
prickled
when
a
figure
stepped
forward
from
a
narrow
closet
against
the
wall
ugh
howdy
he
grunted
and
they
saw
that
he
was
a
very
old
and
very
dirty
indian
rain
he
said
slowly
pointing
to
the
door
stop
soon
now
go
get
supper
he
shuffled
over
the
doorsill
and
at
the
edge
he
turned
howdy
he
said
apparently
with
some
vague
idea
of
farewell
much
rain
petrified
they
watched
him
hobble
away
through
the
woods

libbie
secret
gilbert
lane
was
the
first
to
recover
his
voice
well
what
do
you
know
about
that
he
ejaculated
the
old
bird
was
here
all
the
time
are
are
are
there
any
more
of
them
stammered
louise
no
that
old
fellow
is
the
only
indian
for
miles
around
said
gilbert
carelessly
he
was
left
behind
the
fellows
at
school
say
when
that
band
stole
the
macklin
treasure
they
had
a
grudge
against
him
it
seems
and
they
tripped
him
and
left
him
with
a
broken
leg
he
worked
around
on
different
farms
for
years
and
now
does
a
day
work
often
enough
to
keep
him
in
food
queer
old
dick
i
guess
what
makes
you
girls
look
so
funny
demanded
sydney
you
not
afraid
now
are
you
that
indian
wo
come
back
he
was
more
afraid
of
us
than
we
were
of
him
i
figure
out
he
was
asleep
when
we
came
in
and
the
noise
woke
him
up
what
are
you
smiling
about
my
grandmother
is
marcia
macklin
explained
norma
and
you
see
it
was
her
gold
and
silver
and
jewels
the
indians
stole
i
wonder
what
he
would
have
said
if
we
had
told
him
gee
is
that
so
asked
sydney
ignoring
the
latter
half
of
sentence
and
is
all
that
stuff
down
in
the
chasm
yet
as
far
as
we
know
it
is
said
norma
and
likely
to
remain
there
she
added
with
a
sigh
bob
and
the
boys
returned
in
less
than
half
an
hour
to
announce
that
they
had
found
the
right
road
and
were
prepared
to
pilot
the
girls
expeditiously
homeward
libbie
cheeks
were
unnaturally
flushed
and
she
looked
miserable
but
she
refused
to
let
bob
and
tommy
carry
her
by
forming
a
chair
with
their
hands
i
all
right
she
insisted
hoarsely
i
only
want
to
get
home
knowing
the
way
positively
saved
much
fumbling
and
time
and
soon
the
familiar
buildings
of
shadyside
loomed
up
before
them
the
boys
had
a
long
tramp
still
before
them
and
if
they
were
not
to
be
late
for
supper
must
walk
briskly
they
continued
on
their
way
while
the
girls
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
dormitory
building
there
no
use
talking
libbie
you
got
to
see
the
infirmary
nurse
said
bobby
resolutely
i
promised
your
mother
to
look
after
you
and
if
you
going
to
be
sick
you
at
least
have
the
proper
care
wait
till
we
get
into
some
dry
things
and
i
take
you
libbie
looked
rebellious
but
she
made
no
verbal
protest
and
when
they
were
once
more
in
dry
clothes
bobby
marched
her
cousin
to
the
immaculate
infirmary
she
returned
alone
saying
that
the
nurse
had
detained
libbie
for
observation
over
night
she
thinks
she
getting
a
heavy
cold
but
it
may
be
more
serious
bobby
reported
well
anyway
i
done
my
duty
but
romantic
people
are
always
forgetting
to
wear
their
rubbers
betty
had
just
drowsed
off
to
sleep
that
night
the
girls
having
gone
to
bed
immediately
after
the
study
hour
for
the
afternoon
in
the
wind
and
rain
had
made
them
extraordinarily
sleepy
when
a
soft
knock
on
the
door
startled
her
she
slipped
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
the
door
opening
it
carefully
so
as
not
to
wake
bobby
miss
morris
the
school
nurse
and
miss
lacey
stood
there
elizabeth
is
worse
said
miss
morris
hastily
noting
betty
look
of
alarm
but
she
is
very
restless
and
wants
to
see
you
miss
lacey
says
you
may
come
up
get
your
dressing
gown
and
slippers
dear
betty
obeyed
quickly
libbie
was
probably
lonely
she
reflected
the
infirmary
consisted
of
three
connecting
rooms
fitted
with
two
single
beds
in
each
and
libbie
happened
to
be
the
only
patient
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
well
wrapped
up
when
betty
saw
her
her
eyes
unnaturally
bright
her
cheeks
very
red
now
i
leave
you
two
girls
together
for
exactly
half
an
hour
said
the
nurse
kindly
after
that
elizabeth
must
go
to
sleep
is
the
door
shut
shut
tight
demanded
libbie
feverishly
grasping
betty
hand
with
both
her
hot
dry
ones
yes
dear
yes
affirmed
betty
soothingly
what
the
matter
libbie
is
your
throat
sore
oh
betty
i
in
such
terrible
trouble
gasped
libbie
her
eyes
overflowing
i
so
frightened
tell
me
about
it
dear
soothed
betty
i
help
you
you
know
i
will
has
it
anything
to
do
with
school
she
was
totally
unprepared
for
libbie
next
words
i
have
to
have
some
money
a
lot
of
money
betty
i
spent
my
last
allowance
and
i
ca
write
home
for
more
because
they
will
ask
me
why
i
want
it
i
borrowed
so
much
from
louise
that
i
ca
ask
her
again
i
ought
to
pay
it
back
but
i
got
to
have
twenty
dollars
by
night
what
for
what
the
matter
asked
betty
in
alarm
you
promise
not
to
tell
bobby
demanded
libbie
intensely
promise
me
you
wo
tell
bobby
she
scold
so
and
eustice
would
expel
me
if
you
wo
tell
bobby
or
eustice
betty
i
tell
you
betty
was
now
thoroughly
aroused
she
knew
that
impulsive
libbie
went
about
with
her
pretty
head
filled
with
all
sorts
of
trashy
ideas
and
she
did
know
what
lengths
she
might
have
gone
to
if
eustice
would
expel
her
the
affair
must
be
serious
indeed
i
promise
said
betty
rashly
tell
me
everything
libbie
and
if
i
can
i
help
you
well
you
remember
when
we
went
nutting
said
libbie
i
carried
a
bottle
with
me
with
with
my
name
and
address
written
on
a
slip
of
paper
inside
i
read
about
that
in
a
book
and
i
said
to
leave
an
answer
in
the
same
bottle
i
i
buried
it
just
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
before
we
began
to
climb
louise
was
with
me
but
she
was
hunting
for
specimens
for
her
botany
book
so
that
why
you
hung
back
was
it
said
betty
i
wish
to
goodness
louise
was
more
interested
in
what
is
going
on
around
her
she
might
have
stopped
you
go
on
what
happened
to
your
silly
bottle
i
buried
it
repeated
libbie
and
two
days
after
i
went
out
and
dug
it
up
and
there
was
an
answer
in
it
what
did
it
say
demanded
betty
practically
i
got
it
here
libbie
reached
under
her
pillow
and
pulled
out
a
slip
of
paper
it
says
ten
dollars
in
this
same
place
or
eustice
shall
hear
of
this
and
of
course
concluded
libbie
i
put
ten
dollars
in
the
bottle
because
whoever
found
it
had
the
slip
with
my
name
on
it
to
show
mrs
eustice
betty
studied
the
paper
the
handwriting
was
a
strong
backhand
not
at
all
an
illiterate
hand
oh
dear
what
shall
i
do
wailed
libbie
he
keeps
asking
for
more
and
i
wo
have
any
money
till
the
first
of
the
month
i
only
meant
to
do
like
the
girl
in
the
book
have
a
thrilling
unknown
correspondent
i
never
knew
he
would
ask
for
money
suppose
he
is
a
horrid
dirty
tramp
and
he
comes
and
tells
eustice
he
found
my
note
i
should
die
of
shame
i
have
the
money
ready
for
you
in
the
morning
said
betty
firmly
i
have
that
much
but
of
course
he
keep
demanding
more
i
do
hope
libbie
that
if
you
ever
get
out
of
this
mess
you
be
cured
of
some
of
your
crazy
notions
oh
i
will
promised
libbie
earnestly
i
will
be
good
betty
only
do
tell
bobby
she
was
manifestly
relieved
by
her
confession
and
when
miss
morris
came
in
to
send
betty
back
to
her
own
room
libbie
curled
down
contentedly
for
a
restful
night
not
so
poor
betty
she
turned
and
tossed
wondering
how
she
could
get
more
money
for
her
chum
without
arousing
suspicion
what
ever
made
her
do
a
thing
like
that
she
groaned
of
all
the
wild
ideas
the
twenty
will
take
every
cent
i
have
i
must
see
bob
and
borrow
from
him
libbie
was
much
improved
in
the
morning
so
well
in
fact
that
after
breakfast
in
bed
she
was
permitted
to
dress
and
go
to
her
room
though
strictly
forbidden
to
attend
classes
or
go
out
of
doors
betty
brought
her
the
twenty
dollars
and
when
school
was
in
session
the
benighted
libbie
sped
out
to
her
buried
bottle
and
put
the
money
in
it
regaining
her
room
without
detection
two
days
later
there
was
another
demand
for
money
and
two
days
after
that
another
libbie
visited
the
bottle
regularly
afraid
to
let
a
day
pass
lest
the
blackmailer
expose
her
to
the
principal
betty
had
seen
bob
at
a
football
game
and
had
borrowed
fifteen
dollars
from
him
she
could
not
write
her
uncle
for
communication
with
him
was
uncertain
and
her
generous
allowance
came
to
her
regularly
through
his
philadelphia
lawyer
he
wants
dollars
by
night
whispered
libbie
meeting
betty
in
the
hall
after
her
last
visit
to
the
buried
bottle
oh
betty
what
we
do
both
girls
had
watched
patiently
and
furtively
in
their
spare
time
in
an
effort
to
detect
the
person
who
dug
up
the
bottle
but
they
had
never
seen
any
one
go
near
the
spot
as
it
happened
when
libbie
whispered
her
news
to
betty
they
were
both
on
their
way
to
recitation
with
miss
jessup
whose
current
events
class
both
girls
nominally
enjoyed
betty
found
it
impossible
to
fix
her
mind
on
the
brisk
discussions
and
half
in
a
dream
heard
libbie
flunk
dismally
when
next
she
was
conscious
of
what
was
going
on
about
her
she
had
been
turning
libbie
troubles
over
and
over
in
her
mind
without
result
miss
jessup
was
speaking
to
her
class
about
the
association
of
ideas
we
wo
go
very
deeply
into
it
this
morning
she
was
saying
but
you
find
even
the
surface
of
the
subject
fascinating
then
she
began
a
rapid
fire
of
questions
to
which
betty
paid
small
attention
till
the
sound
of
ada
nansen
name
aroused
her
key
ada
asked
miss
jessup
the
answers
were
supposed
to
indicate
definite
ideas

promptly

asked
miss

to
her
surprise
and
that
of
the
listening

of
whom
were
forming
the
word

with
their
lips
ada
answered
without
hesitation
bottle
you
must
have
thought
i
meant
the
letter
said
the
teacher
lightly
passing
on
to
the
next
pupil
betty
heard
the
dismissal
bell
with
real
relief
she
cornered
libbie
in
the
hall
as
the
class
streamed
out
and
announced
a
decision
i
have
to
go
see
bob
i
paddle
one
of
the
canoes
she
said
hurriedly
if
any
one
asks
for
me
say
i
out
on
the
lake
betty
was
now
an
expert
with
the
paddle
and
the
trip
across
the
lake
was
easy
of
accomplishment
she
had
the
great
good
fortune
to
meet
bob
returning
from
a
recitation
and
though
surprised
to
see
her
he
knew
she
must
have
come
by
boat
or
canoe
the
boys
had
gone
the
next
day
and
brought
back
the
canoes
from
the
woods
where
they
had
placed
them
during
the
storm
i
ever
so
sorry
bob
said
betty
earnestly
but
could
you
lend
me
dollars
bob
whistled
i
could
he
admitted
cautiously
what
it
for
betsey
that
said
betty
is
a
secret
bob
glanced
at
her
sharply
his
chin
hardened
come
down
here
where
we
wo
be
interrupted
he
said
leading
the
way
to
the
wharf
you
have
to
give
me
a
good
reason
for
wanting
the
money
betty
chapter
xix
bob
solution
if
you
wanted
dollars
and
i
had
it
said
betty
persuasively
i
give
it
to
you
without
asking
a
solitary
question
rob
lips
twitched
but
betty
he
began
then
oh
do
play
fair
he
urged
younger
than
i
am
uncle
dick
expects
me
to
look
after
you
goodness
knows
i
do
want
to
pry
into
your
affairs
but
when
you
borrow
fifteen
dollars
and
then
want
the
same
week
what
a
fellow
to
think
if
some
one
is
borrowing
from
you
it
time
to
call
a
halt
you
not
fair
to
yourself
betty
looked
startled
how
could
bob
possibly
guess
so
near
the
truth
she
began
to
think
that
the
better
part
of
wisdom
was
to
confide
in
this
keen
young
man
come
on
betty
tell
me
what
you
want
it
for
and
you
shall
have
twice
said
bob
earnestly
i
most
of
my
allowance
in
the
school
bank
it
all
yours
if
you
let
me
have
an
inkling
of
the
reason
you
need
money
well
said
betty
slowly
i
did
promise
i
would
tell
only
that
i
would
tell
bobby
or
eustice
it
libbie
who
has
to
have
the
money
she
sketched
libbie
story
for
him
rapidly
bob
listening
in
silence
at
the
end
he
asked
a
single
question
have
you
any
of
those
notes
asking
for
money
here
one
betty
thrust
her
hand
into
the
pocket
of
her
sweater
and
pulled
out
the
crumpled
paper
that
libbie
had
shaken
out
of
the
bottle
that
morning
were
they
all
written
on
this
same
kind
of
paper
asked
bob
reading
the
note
that
is
i
think
so
hesitated
betty
i
really
noticed
why
because
i
do
think
any
man
wrote
this
announced
bob
confidently
i
think
some
girl
at
school
has
done
it
either
as
a
joke
or
to
torment
libbie
but
it
writing
protested
betty
though
come
to
think
of
it
we
do
know
any
of
the
girls
handwriting
she
added
thoughtfully
what
girl
would
be
likely
to
do
it
asked
bob
can
you
recall
a
practical
joker
this
is
copy
book
paper
torn
from
an
ordinary
theme
book
yes
i
bet
a
cookie
a
girl
wrote
it
ada
nansen
or
ruth
gladys
royal
might
do
it
to
plague
libbie
said
betty
slowly
they
do
like
any
of
our
crowd
and
libbie
is
so
good
at
french
she
turns
ada
green
with
envy
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
surer
i
am
it
is
ada
ruth
does
dislike
any
one
actively
enough
to
exert
herself
ada
nansen
repeated
bob
is
she
that
girl
we
saw
on
the
train
and
who
plumped
herself
down
in
my
seat
i
thought
so
i
remember
you
told
me
well
from
the
sidelight
i
have
on
her
character
i
believe
she
is
the
one
at
the
bottom
of
this
that
will
explain
too
why
you
never
catch
any
one
digging
up
the
bottle
she
knows
exactly
when
you
are
busy
and
when
you
are
not
bottle
said
betty
explosively
to
bob
amazement
oh
bob
this
morning
miss
jessup
was
talking
to
us
about
association
of
ideas
and
she
asked
ada
what
bee
meant
to
her
we
thought
she
say
of
course
but
she
said
does
that
show
i
should
say
it
did
bob
voice
was
eager
she
took
it
for
the
letter
and
bottle
was
in
her
mind
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
girl
is
at
the
back
of
all
this
fuss
gee
when
i
nothing
else
to
do
i
going
to
study
up
on
this
association
of
ideas
stuff
you
do
need
it
you
can
get
at
things
without
a
bit
of
trouble
betty
assured
him
affectionately
how
will
you
go
about
pinning
down
ada
bob
asked
anxiously
i
cut
out
latin
afternoon
when
she
has
a
study
period
planned
betty
she
think
libbie
is
reciting
and
she
not
think
of
me
at
all
and
i
slip
out
and
watch
to
see
if
she
goes
near
the
bottle
but
what
can
i
do
if
she
does
prove
to
be
the
right
one
tell
eustice
and
poor
libbie
will
be
in
a
peck
of
trouble
i
really
think
eustice
would
send
her
home
if
she
knew
and
serve
libbie
right
for
being
such
an
idiot
pronounced
bob
severely
however
i
think
she
has
been
pretty
thoroughly
punished
through
fear
i
only
wish
you
told
me
this
before
betty
because
i
know
exactly
how
you
can
deal
with
ada
you
do
oh
bob
what
should
i
ever
do
without
you
cried
betty
forgetting
that
a
few
moments
before
she
had
berated
him
for
his
insistence
tell
me
quick
well
a
crowd
of
us
fellows
happened
to
be
over
in
edentown
last
friday
night
and
we
saw
ada
and
ruth
at
the
movies
said
bob
they
did
see
us
for
we
sat
back
they
were
the
only
girls
from
shadyside
and
tommy
and
i
decided
they
had
sneaked
out
after
dinner
and
walked
all
that
distance
now
threatening
is
a
very
nice
performance
betty
but
sometimes
you
have
to
meet
like
with
like
i
think
if
when
you
see
ada
digging
up
the
bottle
you
go
to
her
and
say
that
unless
she
returns
the
money
and
libbie
first
note
to
you
and
promises
to
let
the
matter
drop
forever
you
will
expose
her
edentown
trip
to
eustice
she
will
listen
to
reason
so
do
i
agreed
betty
i
do
think
she
has
touched
the
money
she
has
plenty
but
i
must
have
the
note
so
that
libbie
can
destroy
it
eustice
never
lets
us
go
to
town
at
night
and
i
sure
ada
and
ruth
had
to
go
down
the
goodness
did
they
take
a
chance
of
being
discovered
well
as
i
already
missed
half
an
algebra
recitation
and
you
know
you
have
no
business
over
here
at
this
time
of
day
i
move
we
begin
our
penance
suggested
bob
paddle
home
betsey
and
if
our
hunch
turns
out
wrong
we
tackle
another
one
oh
it
wo
i
sure
you
right
said
betty
gratefully
thank
you
ever
so
much
bob
and
the
next
time
i
tell
you
everything
at
the
very
first
do
let
me
hear
of
another
time
bob
called
after
her
with
mock
severity
well
i
never
gasped
libbie
astonished
when
betty
told
her
of
suspicions
oh
betty
would
it
be
wonderful
if
it
should
be
true
i
going
to
cut
latin
this
afternoon
and
find
out
said
betty
vigorously
if
miss
sharpe
asks
for
me
you
do
know
where
i
am
she
never
does
anything
but
give
you
double
lines
to
translate
betty
knew
that
ada
had
a
study
period
which
she
usually
spent
in
her
room
directly
after
lunch
directly
after
she
left
the
dining
room
that
noon
betty
sped
away
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
there
were
several
stubby
bushes
about
with
leaves
and
old
rubbish
and
affording
an
excellent
screen
betty
crouched
down
behind
one
of
these
she
had
not
long
to
wait
ada
in
her
beautiful
mink
furs
which
she
clung
to
persistently
though
the
fall
weather
so
far
had
been
very
mild
was
presently
seen
coming
across
the
grass
she
walked
straight
to
the
spot
where
the
bottle
was
buried
and
stooping
down
brushed
away
the
leaves
and
dirt
she
lifted
the
bottle
pshaw
it
empty
she
said
aloud
yes
it
empty
echoed
betty
stepping
out
from
behind
the
bush
and
you
are
to
give
the
money
back
to
me
and
libbie
note
with
it
is
that
so
said
ada
contemptuously
i
have
something
to
say
about
that
i
intend
to
see
that
that
note
reaches
the
proper
person
mrs
eustice
betty
took
a
step
nearer
her
dark
eyes
blazing
i
can
play
the
kind
of
game
you
play
if
i
must
she
said
in
a
curiously
repressed
tone
what
about
the
trip
you
and
ruth
gladys
made
to
edentown
last
friday
night
ada
glared
at
her
were
you
there
how
did
you
know
she
stammered
jerkily
if
you
were
up
to
the
same
trick
you
look
nice
on
us
wo
you
i
was
there
but
i
have
witnesses
whom
i
can
summon
to
say
you
were
declared
betty
wishing
her
voice
did
not
tremble
with
nervousness
you
were
the
only
girls
from
shadyside
and
you
must
have
climbed
down
the
fire
ada
raised
her
hand
that
held
the
bottle
you
you
she
screamed
threateningly
betty
flung
up
her
arm
to
knock
the
bottle
aside
missed
ada
hand
and
hit
her
shoulder
ada
went
down
betty
on
top
of
her
girls
for
mercy
sake
miss
anderson
stood
beside
them
scandalized
betty
get
up
ada
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
saw
you
from
the
gym
windows
you
have
the
whole
school
out
here
presently
betty
i
thought
you
had
latin
at
this
period
i
have
admitted
betty
so
meekly
that
miss
anderson
looked
away
lest
she
laugh
only
i
had
to
see
ada
i
do
know
what
you
were
quarreling
about
said
miss
anderson
with
characteristic
frankness
but
i
do
know
that
both
of
you
are
old
enough
to
know
better
than
to
revert
to
tactics
you
a
hole
in
your
stocking
betty
that
would
do
credit
to
a
little
brother
i
ripped
it
on
that
stone
said
betty
regretfully
ada
stood
sullenly
unconscious
of
two
dead
leaves
hanging
to
her
hat
which
completely
destroyed
her
usual
effect
of
studied
elegance
go
on
in
betty
said
the
physical
culture
teacher
who
labored
under
no
delusions
about
the
duties
of
a
peacemaker
to
tell
the
truth
she
did
not
believe
in
forced
reconciliation
ada
will
come
with
me
ada
has
something
i
want
said
betty
stubbornly
she
has
to
promise
to
give
it
to
me
first
ada
looked
at
the
resolute
little
figure
facing
her
betty
she
knew
was
capable
of
doing
exactly
what
she
had
said
eustice
had
no
more
rigid
rule
than
the
one
against
going
to
town
day
or
night
without
permission
ada
gave
in
i
leave
it
in
your
room
before
dinner
you
did
think
i
carried
it
with
me
did
you
she
snapped
both
said
betty
significantly
meaning
the
note
and
the
money
everything
cried
the
exasperated
ada
on
the
verge
of
angry
tears
then
you
have
my
promise
never
to
say
a
word
betty
assured
her
blithely
do
you
want
this
bottle
miss
anderson
called
after
her
as
she
started
for
the
school
miss
anderson
had
been
studying
both
girls
as
she
waited
quietly
now
betty
turned
smiled
radiantly
and
took
the
bottle
the
teacher
held
out
to
her
with
careful
aim
worthy
of
bob
training
she
fixed
her
eye
on
a
handy
rock
hurled
the
bottle
with
all
her
strength
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
it
dashed
into
a
thousand
fragments
as
it
struck
the
target
squarely
then
she
trotted
sedately
on
to
her
delayed
recitation
and
miss
anderson
and
the
scowling
ada
followed
more
slowly
just
before
dinner
that
night
there
came
a
knock
on
betty
door
and
virgie
smith
one
of
ada
friends
thrust
a
package
at
bobby
who
had
answered
the
tap
betty
managed
to
turn
aside
her
chum
curiosity
and
to
get
away
to
libbie
and
give
her
the
note
they
burned
it
in
the
flame
of
a
candle
and
counted
the
money
it
was
all
there
folded
just
as
libbie
had
placed
it
in
the
bottle
evidently
ada
had
never
carried
it
libbie
paid
louise
the
money
she
had
borrowed
of
her
and
gave
betty
the
amount
she
owed
her
most
of
which
was
bob
now
do
try
to
be
more
sensible
libbie
pleaded
betty
turning
to
go
back
to
bobby
when
you
want
to
do
something
romantic
think
twice
and
count
a
hundred
i
will
promised
libbie
fervently
i
never
be
so
silly
again
betty
but
dear
me
she
was
a
hundred
times
but
in
a
different
way
each
time
libbie
would
be
libbie
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
betty
rushing
back
to
brush
her
hair
for
dinner
heard
a
sound
suspiciously
like
a
sob
as
she
passed
norma
guerin
door
it
was
unlatched
and
as
no
one
answered
when
she
tapped
betty
gently
pushed
it
open
and
stepped
into
the
room
norma
lay
on
her
bed
crying
as
though
her
heart
would
break
and
alice
looking
very
forlorn
and
solemn
was
holding
a
letter
in
her
hand
chapter
xx
the
second
degree
my
patience
what
a
world
of
trouble
this
is
sighed
betty
to
herself
but
aloud
she
said
cheerily
what
the
matter
with
norma
norma
sat
up
mopping
her
eyes
oh
betty
she
choked
i
do
believe
alice
and
i
can
come
back
after
christmas
they
had
a
fire
in
glenside
and
a
house
dad
owns
there
burned
he
has
a
cent
of
insurance
and
the
mortgagee
takes
the
ground
so
that
the
rental
right
out
of
our
income
besides
grandma
has
had
an
operation
on
her
eyes
and
she
has
to
spend
weeks
in
an
expensive
philadelphia
hospital
even
with
the
small
fees
the
surgeons
charge
because
of
dad
the
board
will
amount
to
more
than
he
can
afford
to
pay
alice
and
i
ought
to
be
learning
stenography
or
something
useful
well
now
your
father
would
say
suggested
betty
with
determined
optimism
that
the
christmas
vacation
is
too
far
off
to
make
any
plans
about
what
you
going
to
do
afterward
you
know
bobby
littell
has
set
her
heart
on
you
and
alice
spending
the
recess
with
them
in
washington
anyway
lots
of
things
can
turn
up
before
christmas
norma
even
the
treasure
norma
tried
to
smile
i
dream
about
that
chasm
nearly
every
night
she
said
sometimes
i
think
the
indians
came
back
and
got
the
stuff
betty
they
so
clever
about
climbing
and
i
know
they
would
easily
give
up
nonsense
chided
betty
the
treasure
is
there
and
we
just
got
to
think
up
a
way
to
get
it
out
at
all
costs
you
must
cry
yourself
sick
about
the
future
you
spoil
all
the
fun
awaiting
you
in
the
weeks
before
christmas
and
you
know
you
ca
study
as
well
when
depressed
and
goodness
knows
one
has
to
study
at
shadyside
i
a
headache
now
confessed
norma
pushing
her
tumbled
hair
out
of
her
eyes
i
ca
go
down
to
dinner
i
a
perfect
sight
the
bell
just
lie
down
and
try
to
rest
advised
betty
smoothing
the
tangled
covers
with
a
deft
hand
i
bring
you
up
some
supper
on
a
tray
aunt
nancy
thinks
you
an
angel
on
general
principles
and
she
has
a
special
soft
spot
in
her
heart
for
you
because
her
mother
used
to
cook
for
your
grandmother
come
on
alice
we
turn
the
light
out
and
let
her
rest
her
eyes
i
do
wish
some
one
would
think
up
a
way
to
get
those
pearls
and
the
gold
fretted
betty
turning
restlessly
on
her
pillow
that
night
if
norma
and
alice
are
ever
going
to
be
now
is
the
time
when
they
so
old
they
ca
walk
money
wo
do
any
good
which
showed
that
betty
for
all
her
sound
sense
was
still
a
little
girl
very
old
ladies
who
can
not
walk
certainly
need
money
to
make
them
comfortable
and
keep
them
so
the
next
night
was
friday
and
betty
welcomed
the
prospect
of
the
second
degree
necessary
to
stamp
the
freshmen
as
members
of
the
mysterious
for
the
week
had
been
noticeably
tinged
with
indigo
for
at
least
two
of
betty
friends
and
she
hoped
the
initiation
might
take
their
minds
from
their
troubles
the
second
degree
it
was
whispered
about
among
the
girls
was
bound
to
be
a
hummer
they
say
it
a
test
of
your
character
said
bobby
with
a
shiver
somehow
betty
my
character
oozes
out
of
my
shoes
when
it
knows
it
should
be
prancing
up
to
the
firing
line
i
guess
you
imagine
that
smiled
betty
speak
sternly
to
it
bobby
and
explain
that
funking
is
out
of
the
question
however
more
girls
than
bobby
found
it
necessary
to
clutch
at
their
oozing
courage
when
upon
assembling
in
the
large
hall
the
lights
suddenly
went
out
in
the
shadows
four
white
veiled
figures
were
seen
slowly
to
mount
the
platform
said
one
of
them
stretching
out
a
long
arm
and
pointing
toward
the
fascinated
and
expectant
audience
we
are
your
fates
you
have
come
to
the
final
tests
we
have
no
choice
in
these
tests
nor
have
you
you
are
to
come
forward
one
at
a
time
and
take
a
slip
from
this
basket
here
on
the
table
go
directly
to
your
room
after
drawing
your
slip
and
there
open
it
and
follow
the
directions
explicitly
come
to
the
platform
in
the
order
in
which
you
are
seated
please
the
lights
did
not
come
on
and
one
by
one
the
girls
stumbled
up
the
steps
to
the
platform
felt
around
in
the
basket
and
drew
a
slip
then
they
hurried
away
to
their
rooms
to
see
what
was
to
happen
next
bobby
and
betty
could
hardly
wait
to
open
their
notes
and
before
they
had
them
fairly
digested
frances
and
libbie
and
constance
and
louise
and
the
guerin
girls
were
crowding
in
to
compare
notes
i
have
to
go
and
ask
miss
prettyman
if
i
may
telephone
to
salsette
academy
and
ask
for
a
notice
on
their
bulletin
board
wailed
bobby
i
supposed
to
have
lost
a
pair
of
gloves
at
the
last
football
game
i
always
have
the
worst
luck
ca
you
imagine
how
miss
prettyman
will
lecture
me
she
say
that
at
my
age
i
ought
to
have
something
in
my
head
besides
excuses
to
talk
to
the
boys
the
girls
laughed
recognizing
the
ring
of
prophecy
in
bobby
speech
that
nothing
i
to
row
dora
estabrooke
twice
around
the
lake
mourned
louise
she
weighs
two
hundred
if
she
weighs
a
pound
thank
goodness
i
do
have
to
do
it
norma
was
instructed
to
walk
three
times
around
the
cellar
chanting
little
boy
blue
before
ten
that
night
frances
martin
to
her
horror
was
enjoined
to
produce
six
live
angle
worms
the
following
morning
and
you
know
i
despise
the
wiggling
things
she
wailed
alice
guerin
the
silent
member
of
the
octette
was
condemned
to
recite
the
children
hour
in
the
dining
room
between
cereal
and
eggs
and
constance
howard
was
told
she
must
add
up
an
unbelievably
long
column
of
figures
and
present
the
correct
answer
within
half
an
hour
was
figures
and
already
these
long
columns
danced
dizzily
before
her
eyes
you
need
tell
me
that
chance
made
such
canny
selections
observed
betty
one
of
those
girls
manipulated
the
right
notes
into
our
hands
libbie
what
does
yours
say
libbie
handed
her
slip
of
paper
to
betty
without
a
word
go
to
bed
at
once
the
latter
read
aloud
there
was
a
gale
of
laughter
libbie
the
curious
who
dearly
loved
to
hear
and
see
to
be
sent
off
to
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
most
wildly
exciting
night
they
had
known
in
weeks
hurry
admonished
bobby
you
disobeying
by
staying
up
this
long
where
your
character
libbie
libbie
scowled
but
departed
grumbling
that
she
did
see
why
she
could
stay
up
and
watch
norma
walk
down
in
the
cellar
mine
is
the
most
spooky
said
betty
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
libbie
listen
i
to
climb
the
water
tower
at
midnight
and
leave
this
card
there
to
show
i
have
complied
she
held
out
a
little
plain
white
card
in
a
green
envelope
hark
was
that
somebody
at
the
door
asked
bobby
and
she
ran
over
to
it
lightly
and
jerked
it
open
the
corridor
was
empty
we
all
nervous
remarked
betty
lightly
i
set
the
alarm
for
and
put
the
clock
under
my
pillow
so
miss
lacey
hear
it
i
lie
down
all
dressed
and
then
i
wo
have
to
use
a
light
she
might
see
that
through
the
transom
do
you
want
some
of
us
to
go
with
you
asked
constance
we
go
up
into
the
tower
if
you
say
not
but
at
least
we
could
go
that
far
with
you
you
might
fall
off
the
roof
no
please
i
rather
go
alone
said
betty
firmly
it
a
test
you
see
and
the
idea
is
to
make
it
easy
i
be
all
right
and
in
the
morning
the
girls
will
find
the
card
and
know
i
did
flunk
after
the
girls
had
gone
away
to
their
own
rooms
the
clock
was
set
for
a
quarter
of
twelve
but
betty
and
bobby
decided
that
they
might
as
well
stay
awake
till
midnight
they
would
lie
down
on
their
beds
betty
insisted
that
bobby
should
undress
and
go
to
bed
right
and
wait
for
the
time
to
come
within
twenty
minutes
they
were
both
sound
asleep
the
muffled
whir
of
her
alarm
clock
awakened
betty
for
a
moment
she
was
dazed
then
recollection
cleared
her
mind
she
slipped
to
the
floor
without
waking
bobby
and
softly
tiptoed
from
the
room
a
dim
light
burned
in
the
corridor
and
betty
knew
the
way
to
the
water
tower
to
reach
it
one
had
to
mount
to
the
roof
of
the
dormitory
building
betty
experienced
a
little
difficulty
with
the
obstinate
catch
of
the
scuttle
cover
but
she
finally
mastered
it
and
stepped
out
on
the
tarred
graveled
roof
the
water
tower
a
huge
tank
on
an
iron
framework
had
a
little
enclosed
room
built
directly
under
it
reached
by
an
iron
ladder
here
the
engineer
kept
various
plumbing
tools
it
was
in
this
room
that
betty
was
to
leave
the
card
the
night
wind
blew
damp
and
keen
and
the
stars
overhead
seemed
very
far
away
betty
had
no
sense
of
fear
as
she
began
to
climb
mounting
slowly
and
feeling
for
each
step
with
her
hands
the
friendly
dark
shut
in
around
her
and
somewhere
in
the
distance
a
train
whistle
tooted
shrilly
she
knew
she
had
reached
the
last
step
when
her
hands
encountered
wood
and
she
felt
about
till
she
touched
the
knob
of
the
door
it
opened
at
her
touch
and
she
pulled
herself
in
over
the
sill
now
the
card
she
whispered
feeling
in
her
pocket
a
gust
of
wind
fanned
her
cheek
and
something
clicked
the
door
had
blown
shut
chapter
xxi
dramatics
there
are
pleasanter
places
to
be
at
midnight
than
the
dark
room
of
a
strange
water
tower
but
betty
was
not
frightened
she
tripped
over
some
tool
as
she
felt
for
the
door
and
discovered
that
she
had
lost
her
sense
of
direction
completely
i
all
turned
around
was
the
way
she
expressed
it
i
must
start
and
go
around
the
sides
feeling
till
i
come
to
the
door
following
this
plan
she
did
come
to
the
door
and
confidently
turned
the
knob
the
door
stuck
and
she
rattled
the
knob
sharply
then
the
explanation
dawned
on
her
the
door
was
locked
could
it
have
a
spring
lock
she
wondered
then
she
remembered
a
day
when
on
exploration
bent
a
group
of
girls
had
made
the
trip
to
the
roof
and
the
kindly
dave
mcguire
had
taken
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
unlocked
the
door
of
the
little
room
for
the
more
adventurous
ones
who
wanted
to
climb
up
and
see
the
inside
it
was
a
flat
key
like
a
latch
key
betty
reflected
the
girls
must
have
had
the
door
unlocked
for
me
but
i
do
think
they
would
follow
me
and
lock
it
that
would
be
mean
however
the
door
was
locked
and
she
was
a
prisoner
it
was
inky
black
and
at
every
step
she
seemed
to
knock
over
something
or
stumble
against
cold
iron
gradually
her
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
lack
of
light
and
she
made
out
the
outlines
of
something
against
the
wall
why
there
is
a
window
i
remember
she
said
aloud
i
wonder
if
i
can
reach
it
cautiously
she
felt
her
way
around
and
stretched
up
tentative
fingers
she
could
barely
touch
the
lower
frame
then
for
the
first
time
betty
felt
a
little
shiver
of
fear
and
apprehension
it
was
close
in
the
tower
room
and
the
smell
of
oil
and
dead
air
began
to
be
oppressive
she
had
no
wish
to
shout
even
if
she
could
be
heard
a
doubtful
probability
for
she
had
no
mind
to
be
rescued
before
the
curious
eyes
of
the
entire
school
i
get
out
of
it
somehow
if
i
have
to
stay
here
all
night
she
told
herself
pluckily
oh
my
goodness
what
was
that
a
tiny
sawing
noise
in
one
corner
of
the
room
sent
betty
scurrying
to
the
other
side
she
would
have
indignantly
denied
any
fear
of
mice
or
rats
but
the
bravest
girl
might
be
excused
from
a
too
close
acquaintance
thrust
upon
her
in
the
dark
betty
had
no
wish
to
put
her
fingers
on
a
mouse
how
can
i
get
out
she
cried
aloud
a
little
wildly
i
ca
breathe
in
the
uncanny
silence
that
followed
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
sawing
noise
sounded
regularly
rhythmically
in
desperation
betty
seized
an
iron
crowbar
she
had
backed
into
on
the
wall
and
hurled
it
in
the
direction
of
the
industrious
rodents
now
i
done
it
she
admitted
as
with
a
clatter
and
a
bang
that
she
was
sure
could
be
heard
a
mile
away
an
evident
avalanche
of
tools
tumbled
to
the
floor
her
crowbar
had
struck
a
box
of
tools
but
the
silence
shut
down
again
after
that
betty
did
not
realize
that
the
water
tower
was
so
isolated
that
even
unusual
noises
inside
it
would
not
carry
far
and
with
the
door
and
the
window
both
closed
the
room
was
practically
sealed
the
sawing
noise
was
not
repeated
there
was
that
much
to
be
grateful
for
betty
reflected
she
wondered
if
she
could
batter
down
the
door
i
try
anyway
she
thought
wearily
and
then
she
could
not
find
the
crowbar
around
and
around
she
went
feeling
on
the
floor
for
the
tools
that
had
clattered
down
with
such
a
racket
and
for
the
iron
bar
she
had
hurled
among
them
not
one
tool
could
she
put
her
hands
on
i
must
be
going
crazy
she
cried
in
despair
i
could
have
dreamed
those
tools
fell
down
and
yet
where
could
they
have
gone
there
no
hole
in
the
floor
now
betty
nerves
were
sorely
tried
by
the
lonely
imprisonment
the
bad
air
the
heat
and
the
darkness
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
her
usual
sound
common
sense
was
tricked
by
her
imagination
her
fancy
suggested
that
the
weight
of
the
tools
might
have
torn
a
hole
in
the
floor
they
might
have
dropped
through
to
the
roof
and
betty
herself
might
be
in
momentary
danger
of
stepping
into
this
hole
nonsense
well
wiser
minds
have
conceived
wilder
possibilities
under
similar
trying
conditions
i
wo
walk
another
step
cried
poor
betty
as
she
visioned
this
yawning
hole
not
another
step
i
wait
till
it
light
but
she
waited
fifteen
twenty
thirty
minutes
and
the
darkness
if
anything
grew
blacker
she
had
no
idea
how
long
she
had
been
locked
in
the
room
and
she
could
not
calculate
how
far
off
the
morning
might
be
i
put
my
hands
out
before
me
and
creep
she
said
finally
that
ought
to
be
safe
perhaps
i
can
find
something
to
stand
on
to
reach
that
window
i
guess
i
could
drop
to
the
roof
from
there
stiffly
and
painfully
she
began
to
crawl
holding
out
her
hands
before
her
and
starting
back
time
and
again
as
she
fancied
she
felt
an
opening
just
ahead
but
when
she
brought
up
against
a
step
ladder
she
forgot
her
fears
in
the
joy
of
her
discovery
it
was
a
short
ladder
but
she
dragged
it
over
to
the
window
and
put
it
in
place
and
mounted
it
all
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
by
stretching
to
her
full
height
she
was
able
to
raise
the
creaky
window
but
to
her
dismay
the
roof
offered
a
very
long
drop
she
had
not
realized
how
high
she
had
climbed
dave
was
fussing
with
ropes
and
buckets
the
other
day
she
recalled
now
i
wonder
would
it
be
the
best
luck
in
the
world
if
i
could
find
a
rope
hope
was
singing
high
in
her
heart
now
but
she
almost
despaired
of
such
good
fortune
after
a
diligent
search
then
something
told
her
to
feel
about
again
on
the
floor
round
and
round
she
went
getting
her
fingers
into
spider
webs
and
sticky
substances
that
renewed
her
inward
shudders
because
she
could
not
identify
them
and
when
she
found
the
rope
a
tarry
coil
she
also
solved
the
mystery
of
the
tools
they
had
fallen
down
behind
the
coil
of
rope
and
were
effectively
fenced
off
from
the
circle
of
floor
explored
by
the
bewildered
betty
it
was
the
work
of
a
moment
to
tie
one
end
of
the
rope
to
a
heavy
staple
driven
under
the
window
sill
and
then
closing
her
eyes
to
the
pitch
black
void
beneath
her
betty
let
herself
slide
down
to
the
roof
her
hands
were
cruelly
scratched
by
the
rope
fibres
and
she
was
too
tired
to
care
about
the
evidences
of
her
flight
if
anybody
wants
to
know
about
that
rope
and
the
locked
door
let
she
sighed
defiantly
bobby
woke
up
as
betty
came
in
the
door
and
then
there
were
questions
galore
to
be
answered
betty
was
covered
with
dust
and
her
clothing
was
torn
and
rumpled
bobby
declared
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
to
war
i
feel
it
admitted
betty
let
me
take
a
hot
bath
and
get
into
bed
and
bobby
promise
me
on
your
word
of
honor
that
you
call
me
in
the
morning
whoever
locked
me
in
expects
me
to
stay
there
till
i
missed
and
i
want
to
walk
into
breakfast
as
usual
she
half
regretted
her
instructions
when
bobby
called
her
at
seven
the
next
morning
but
betty
was
nothing
if
not
gritty
and
she
sleepily
struggled
into
her
clothes
ada
nansen
look
of
utter
astonishment
when
she
saw
betty
come
into
the
dining
room
with
the
rest
for
breakfast
told
those
in
the
secret
what
they
had
already
suspected
bobby
must
have
heard
her
listening
at
our
door
last
night
said
betty
what
am
i
going
to
do
why
nothing
of
course
that
was
part
of
the
stunt
or
at
least
i
going
to
consider
it
so
my
card
is
there
so
they
know
i
fulfilled
my
part
dave
mcguire
scratched
his
head
when
he
found
the
rope
and
the
open
window
but
he
wisely
said
nothing
he
had
two
keys
and
one
he
had
loaned
at
the
request
of
the
senior
class
president
to
a
fellow
student
the
other
key
for
emergency
use
hung
on
a
nail
in
the
fourth
story
hall
that
was
the
key
dave
found
in
the
door
lock
when
he
made
his
early
morning
tour
of
inspection
but
the
young
folks
must
be
having
their
fun
he
said
indulgently
and
short
of
burning
down
the
place
is
not
dave
mcguire
who
will
be
interfering
with
tests
were
approaching
bobby
who
with
all
her
love
of
fun
was
a
hard
student
felt
prepared
and
went
around
serenely
constance
howard
had
most
humanly
neglected
so
far
as
the
teacher
of
mathematics
permitted
the
study
that
was
hardest
for
her
her
algebra
she
now
spent
hours
in
cramming
on
this
meanwhile
complaining
to
those
of
her
special
chums
who
would
listen
to
her
of
the
unfairness
of
being
made
to
study
algebra
i
can
add
with
the
use
of
my
fingers
and
subtract
and
divide
and
multiply
at
least
i
know
the
tables
up
through
the
twelves
of
what
use
will
a
and
b
and
x
y
and
z
ever
be
to
me
constance
you
know
that
nonsense
bobby
told
her
we
every
one
of
us
here
because
we
want
to
play
a
bigger
part
in
life
than
the
people
and
we
got
to
dig
in
and
prepare
ourselves
if
you
do
your
work
when
you
ought
to
you
would
be
in
such
an
upset
state
now
yes
grinned
constance
and
went
back
to
her
belated
work
betty
had
found
that
her
year
away
from
school
had
made
it
hard
for
her
to
concentrate
her
mind
on
her
studies
and
while
she
had
not
deliberately
neglected
her
work
as
constance
had
in
her
algebra
she
had
not
always
kept
up
to
the
highest
pitch
she
was
working
furiously
now
with
the
tests
to
face
so
soon
and
with
it
went
the
resolve
to
be
more
studious
from
day
to
day
during
the
rest
of
the
school
year
the
concentration
was
becoming
easier
too
as
the
term
advanced
and
the
teaching
at
shadyside
being
of
the
best
she
felt
sure
she
would
feel
that
she
had
accomplished
something
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
dramatic
club
of
shadyside
woke
to
ambition
as
the
term
progressed
soon
after
the
tests
which
all
the
girls
even
constance
passed
successfully
by
dint
of
threat
and
bribery
each
student
was
tried
out
and
her
ability
duly
catalogued
betty
liked
to
act
and
proved
to
have
a
natural
talent
while
bobby
professing
a
great
love
for
things
theatrical
was
hopeless
on
the
stage
her
efforts
either
moved
her
coaches
to
helpless
laughter
or
caused
them
to
retire
in
indignant
tears
she
is
what
you
call
it
impossible
sighed
madame
the
french
teacher
shaking
her
head
after
witnessing
one
rehearsal
in
which
bobby
as
the
villain
had
convulsed
the
actors
as
well
as
the
student
audience
well
then
i
be
a
stage
hand
declared
bobby
whose
feelings
were
impervious
to
slights
i
going
to
have
something
to
do
with
this
play
ada
nansen
was
eager
to
be
assigned
a
part
the
players
were
chosen
on
merit
and
she
aspired
modestly
to
the
leading
rôle
mainly
because
the
girls
hinted
the
heroine
wore
a
red
velvet
dress
with
a
train
and
a
string
of
pearls
but
ada
it
developed
was
worse
than
bobby
as
an
actress
she
was
impatient
of
correction
and
so
arrogant
toward
the
other
players
that
even
gentle
alice
guerin
was
roused
to
retort
i
have
been
assigned
the
maid
part
yet
she
flashed
when
ada
ordered
her
to
remove
several
stage
properties
that
were
in
the
way
give
it
to
her
alice
encouraged
the
mischievous
bobby
that
girl
would
ruffle
an
angel
alice
and
norma
were
both
valuable
additions
to
the
dramatic
club
ranks
norma
especially
proved
to
be
a
find
and
she
was
given
the
hero
part
after
the
first
rehearsal
while
alice
was
the
mother
betty
much
to
her
surprise
was
posted
on
the
bulletin
board
as
the
leading
lady
down
toward
the
end
of
the
list
of
the
cast
was
ada
nansen
name
as
the
maid
she
be
furious
whispered
bobby
miss
anderson
told
miss
sharpe
when
she
did
think
i
could
hear
that
ada
was
really
good
enough
to
be
the
maid
but
that
they
hoped
she
would
sing
for
them
between
the
acts
miss
anderson
said
if
they
did
let
her
have
some
part
she
be
so
sulky
she
would
sing
a
rehearsal
was
held
in
the
gymnasium
after
school
that
afternoon
and
as
she
went
through
her
first
act
betty
was
uncomfortably
conscious
of
glowering
eyes
following
her
when
the
cue
was
given
for
the
maid
ada
did
not
move
that
your
cue
ada
called
miss
anderson
patiently
i
resigned
miss
anderson
said
ada
clearly
it
a
little
too
much
to
ask
me
to
play
maid
to
two
charity
students
norma
and
alice
shrank
back
but
betty
sprang
forward
how
dare
you
she
flared
white
with
rage
how
dare
you
say
such
a
thing
it
untrue
and
you
know
it
even
if
it
were
so
you
have
no
right
to
say
such
an
outrageous
thing
betty
was
angrier
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
she
possessed
a
lively
temper
and
was
no
meeker
than
she
should
be
but
during
the
past
summer
she
had
learned
to
control
herself
fairly
well
ada
cruel
taunt
directed
with
such
a
sneer
at
the
guerin
sisters
that
every
girl
knew
whom
she
meant
had
sent
betty
temper
to
the
boiling
point
easy
easy
betty
counseled
miss
anderson
putting
an
arm
about
the
shaking
girl
you
not
mending
matters
you
know
then
she
turned
to
ada
who
was
now
rather
frightened
at
what
she
had
done
she
had
not
meant
to
go
so
far
ada
said
miss
anderson
sharply
you
will
apologize
immediately
before
these
girls
for
the
injustice
you
have
done
to
two
of
them
what
you
have
just
said
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
lie
i
will
not
stoop
to
put
my
meaning
in
gentler
phrases
apologize
to
norma
and
alice
at
once
ada
set
her
lips
obstinately
the
teacher
waited
a
moment
i
will
give
you
just
three
minutes
she
declared
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
still
refuse
to
obey
me
i
will
send
for
mrs
eustice
ada
shuffled
her
feet
uneasily
she
had
no
fancy
to
meet
eustice
whose
friendship
for
the
guerins
was
well
known
eustice
had
a
hot
white
anger
of
her
own
that
a
pupil
who
once
witnessed
it
could
never
forget
well
ada
came
miss
anderson
voice
at
the
end
of
the
three
minutes
ada
hastily
stumbled
through
a
apology
painful
to
listen
to
and
then
the
angry
tears
running
down
her
face
turned
and
dashed
from
the
room
chapter
xxii
another
mystery
ready
betty
said
miss
anderson
briskly
you
enter
at
the
left
and
begin
thought
i
heard
voices
do
look
toward
the
auditorium
remember
you
are
supposed
to
be
in
a
small
room
betty
managed
to
command
her
voice
and
the
rehearsal
went
on
miss
anderson
herself
took
the
part
of
the
maid
and
as
she
had
foreseen
by
the
time
they
had
finished
the
hour
they
were
in
a
normal
happy
frame
of
mind
no
reference
was
ever
made
by
any
one
to
ada
speech
but
she
never
appeared
at
another
rehearsal
after
two
weeks
diligent
practice
the
players
were
pronounced
perfect
and
a
night
was
set
for
the
performance
of
the
violet
patchwork
why
do
we
go
to
the
woods
and
get
some
leaves
to
trim
the
assembly
hall
suggested
betty
two
days
before
the
time
for
the
play
eustice
sister
is
coming
to
see
her
and
some
other
guests
and
we
want
it
to
look
nice
we
might
get
some
nuts
too
aunt
nancy
promised
us
nut
cake
with
ice
cream
if
we
get
her
enough
all
right
i
like
to
go
nutting
agreed
bobby
but
for
sake
if
we
going
to
walk
a
hundred
miles
this
time
let
have
something
to
eat
with
us
sandwiches
and
a
regular
spread
how
many
have
boxes
from
home
a
canvass
showed
that
a
round
dozen
of
the
girls
had
been
favored
that
week
and
at
bobby
suggestion
they
donated
their
goodies
to
the
common
cause
not
all
the
girls
will
want
to
go
said
betty
some
are
such
poor
walkers
they
decline
at
the
first
hint
of
a
hike
every
one
in
the
will
want
to
go
i
think
and
that
eleven
then
counting
the
girls
with
boxes
and
the
others
who
have
asked
to
come
we
have
twenty
twenty
of
us
ought
to
manage
to
bring
home
enough
leaves
to
trim
the
hall
respectably
we
might
ask
for
a
holiday
bobby
face
beamed
at
the
thought
we
have
had
a
day
off
in
weeks
and
eustice
said
a
long
time
ago
she
thought
we
earned
one
will
you
do
the
asking
betty
betty
was
accustomed
to
doing
the
asking
and
she
said
she
would
once
more
if
norma
guerin
would
go
with
her
wherever
possible
betty
drew
norma
into
every
school
activity
and
she
persistently
refused
to
allow
her
friend
to
talk
as
though
the
christmas
holidays
would
end
their
days
at
shadyside
alice
worried
less
than
norma
but
both
girls
grieved
at
the
thought
of
the
sacrifice
those
at
home
were
making
for
them
and
felt
that
they
could
not
accept
it
much
longer
without
vigorous
protest
betty
and
bobby
on
the
other
hand
were
determined
to
see
to
it
that
the
sisters
spent
their
holidays
in
washington
and
while
bobby
cherished
wild
plans
of
filling
a
trunk
with
new
dresses
and
hats
and
forcing
it
in
some
manner
upon
her
chums
betty
concentrated
her
attention
on
the
subject
of
cash
she
intended
to
consult
her
uncle
in
person
if
possible
and
if
that
proved
impossible
by
letter
and
bob
as
to
the
feasibility
of
persuading
norma
and
alice
to
borrow
a
sum
sufficient
to
see
them
through
to
graduation
day
at
shadyside
betty
was
sure
her
uncle
and
bob
in
both
of
whom
she
had
infinite
faith
could
manage
this
difficult
task
satisfactorily
though
the
guerin
pride
was
a
formidable
obstacle
acting
immediately
on
the
decision
to
ask
for
a
holiday
betty
and
norma
went
down
to
the
office
and
preferred
their
request
which
was
cordially
granted
after
an
explanation
of
its
purpose
all
day
off
shouted
betty
bursting
in
upon
the
six
girls
assembled
to
hear
the
result
we
may
go
after
breakfast
and
need
come
back
till
four
when
miss
anderson
has
called
a
dress
rehearsal
chimed
in
norma
libbie
and
louise
were
dispatched
to
notify
the
other
girls
and
to
give
strict
instructions
to
those
who
had
boxes
not
to
eat
any
more
of
the
contents
elsie
taylor
had
already
eaten
six
eclairs
when
i
requisitioned
her
box
for
the
picnic
said
constance
howard
it
lucky
we
going
tomorrow
or
there
would
be
much
left
to
eat
betty
and
bobby
each
had
a
box
from
littell
who
sent
packages
of
sensible
goodies
regularly
to
her
girls
in
turn
i
hope
the
sandwiches
will
keep
fresh
enough
worried
betty
but
she
might
have
saved
her
worry
just
as
she
and
bobby
were
going
to
bed
that
night
norma
and
alice
came
in
wrapped
in
their
kimonos
each
carrying
a
large
box
under
her
arm
what
do
you
suppose
asked
norma
good
old
aunt
nancy
heard
we
were
going
after
nuts
for
her
cake
and
leaves
for
the
hall
and
she
made
us
dozens
of
sandwiches
she
said
she
did
it
because
eustice
reserved
one
of
the
best
seats
for
her
at
the
play
anyway
we
be
glad
to
have
them
sha
we
and
oh
yes
aunt
nancy
says
she
make
us
a
cake
as
big
as
black
walnut
tree
and
two
kinds
of
ice
cream
and
she
brought
the
sandwiches
up
to
norma
and
alice
because
she
was
determined
they
should
have
something
for
the
picnic
thought
betty
after
the
girls
had
gone
talk
about
tact
aunt
nancy
has
the
real
thing
the
girls
were
all
up
early
the
next
morning
and
soon
after
breakfast
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
woods
many
of
those
who
were
not
of
the
nutting
party
went
to
edentown
some
took
canoes
and
went
paddling
others
puttered
around
the
school
grounds
enjoying
the
beautiful
autumn
weather
and
the
luxury
of
a
holiday
ada
nansen
and
her
friends
had
elected
to
go
to
edentown
and
passed
the
nutting
party
on
the
way
betty
took
one
glance
into
the
bus
and
then
looked
at
bobby
that
young
person
promptly
giggled
did
you
see
what
i
saw
she
asked
poor
ada
said
betty
she
does
have
troubles
of
her
own
for
of
all
the
teachers
miss
prettyman
alone
had
been
available
as
chaperone
and
to
go
to
town
under
miss
prettyman
eagle
eye
was
anything
but
an
exciting
experience
she
was
usually
bent
on
improving
the
minds
of
her
charges
and
she
improved
them
with
serene
disregard
of
the
victims
tastes
and
interests
betty
and
bobby
had
seen
her
sitting
bolt
upright
in
the
bus
reading
a
thin
volume
of
essays
while
ada
scowled
at
the
happy
crowd
tramping
in
the
road
the
woods
reached
they
separated
some
to
gather
branches
of
leaves
and
others
intent
on
filling
their
sacks
with
nuts
the
boxes
of
lunch
were
neatly
piled
under
a
tree
and
sweaters
were
left
with
them
for
it
was
comfortably
warm
even
in
the
shadiest
spots
i
do
believe
we
will
have
many
more
days
like
this
remarked
frances
martin
her
nearsighted
eyes
peering
into
a
hollow
tree
stump
girls
what
have
i
found
a
squirrel
plain
owl
laughed
betty
is
he
cunning
they
crowded
around
to
admire
the
funny
little
creature
and
then
admonished
by
bobby
whom
constance
declared
would
make
a
good
drill
sergeant
set
busily
to
work
again
nuts
were
not
plentiful
but
they
filled
half
a
sack
and
then
a
large
pile
of
flaming
branches
having
been
gathered
they
decided
to
drag
their
spoils
back
to
the
tree
and
to
have
lunch
girls
girls
girls
shrieked
libbie
who
was
in
the
lead
our
lunch
is
gone
every
crumb
of
it
sure
enough
the
sweaters
were
all
tossed
about
in
confusion
and
the
boxes
had
disappeared
who
took
it
demanded
bobby
wrathfully
you
need
tell
me
that
lunch
walked
off
high
and
clear
and
shrill
a
familiar
whistle
sounded
back
of
them
that
bob
betty
face
brightened
listen
she
gave
an
answering
whistle
and
bob
sounded
again
there
was
a
scrambling
among
the
bushes
and
a
group
of
cadets
burst
through
bob
and
the
tucker
twins
were
first
and
after
them
came
gilbert
lane
and
timothy
derby
and
winifred
marion
brown
hello
anything
the
matter
was
bob
greeting
you
look
rather
glum
so
would
you
betty
informed
him
if
you
were
starving
after
a
morning
work
and
your
lunch
was
stolen
gee
that
is
tough
exclaimed
bob
sympathetically
who
stole
it
we
do
know
volunteered
bobby
but
all
those
boxes
could
take
wings
and
fly
away
you
go
back
and
get
the
fellows
bob
commanded
tommy
tucker
we
were
having
a
potato
roast
down
by
the
lake
and
while
the
potatoes
were
baking
some
of
us
came
up
for
more
wood
he
explained
to
the
girls
we
thought
we
heard
voices
and
so
i
whistled
tommy
tucker
was
flying
down
to
the
lake
before
half
of
this
explanation
was
given
have
you
a
holiday
too
betty
asked
we
out
to
get
decorations
for
the
play
it
the
colonel
birthday
explained
bob
and
the
old
boy
gave
us
the
day
off
here
come
the
fellows
half
a
dozen
more
cadets
joined
them
all
boys
the
girls
had
met
at
the
games
they
were
loud
in
their
expressions
of
sympathy
for
the
disappointed
picnickers
and
promptly
offered
their
potatoes
as
refreshments
when
they
should
be
done
oh
we
going
to
get
that
lunch
back
announced
bob
henderson
confidently
look
here
he
pointed
to
some
footprints
in
a
bit
of
muddy
ground
cadet
shoes
cried
tommy
tucker
jimminy
crickets
i
bet
it
that
marshall
morgan
and
his
crowd
but
this
is
a
girl
shoe
protested
betty
pointing
to
another
print
see
the
narrow
toe
ada
nansen
or
ruth
royal
guessed
bobby
quickly
they
the
only
ones
who
wo
wear
a
sensible
shoe
chapter
xxiii
just
deserts
who
demanded
betty
is
marshall
morgan
he
a
pest
said
tommy
with
characteristic
frankness
he
has
one
mission
in
life
and
that
is
to
plague
those
unfortunates
who
have
to
be
under
the
same
roof
with
him
he
never
does
anything
on
a
large
scale
but
then
a
mosquito
can
drive
you
crazy
you
know
dear
me
he
ought
to
know
ada
rejoined
bobby
perhaps
he
does
she
is
a
pestess
if
there
is
such
a
word
there
is
betty
assured
her
anyway
this
wo
get
our
lunch
back
what
are
you
going
to
do
bob
a
little
indian
work
was
bob
reply
we
send
out
scouts
to
locate
the
thieves
and
then
we
surround
them
and
let
the
consequences
fall
i
be
a
consequence
declared
bobby
vindictively
i
fall
on
ada
with
such
force
she
think
an
avalanche
has
struck
her
bob
sent
some
of
the
boys
to
trace
the
steps
and
while
they
were
gone
outlined
his
plans
to
the
others
once
they
knew
where
the
marauders
were
they
were
to
spread
out
and
swoop
down
upon
the
enemy
i
figure
they
get
a
safe
distance
away
and
then
stop
to
eat
the
lunch
said
bob
it
is
hardly
likely
that
they
will
take
the
stuff
back
to
school
with
them
but
ada
went
to
edentown
protested
libbie
we
saw
her
in
the
bus
did
we
girls
and
ruth
too
they
could
easily
come
back
in
the
same
bus
said
betty
indeed
willing
to
wager
that
is
just
what
they
did
miss
prettyman
as
a
chaperone
probably
killed
any
desire
ada
had
to
go
shopping
the
scouts
came
back
after
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
to
report
that
they
had
discovered
the
invaders
camped
under
a
large
oak
tree
and
preparing
to
open
the
boxes
they
were
laughing
and
saying
how
they
put
one
over
on
you
said
gilbert
lane
well
they
wo
laugh
long
retorted
bob
grimly
how
many
are
there
marshall
morgan
jim
cronk
the
royce
boys
all
three
of
hilbert
mitchell
and
george
timmins
named
gilbert
using
his
fingers
as
an
adding
machine
then
there
are
nine
girls
has
one
of
them
a
brown
velvet
hat
with
a
pink
rose
at
the
front
and
brown
gaiters
and
mink
furs
and
a
perfectly
lovely
velvet
handbag
asked
betty
and
did
you
see
a
girl
with
black
pumps
and
white
silk
stockings
and
a
blue
tricotine
dress
embroidered
with
crystal
beads
the
boys
looked
bewildered
do
believe
we
did
admitted
gilbert
regretfully
but
one
of
called
a
skinny
girl
and
somebody
is
named
never
mind
the
clothes
bobby
told
him
gratefully
we
knew
those
two
were
mixed
up
in
this
they
started
cautiously
mindful
of
bob
instructions
not
to
make
a
noise
and
succeeded
after
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
creeping
in
getting
within
hearing
distance
of
the
despoilers
you
girls
will
have
to
tend
to
your
friends
grinned
bob
you
expect
us
to
discipline
them
but
we
give
the
boys
something
to
remember
the
party
spread
out
and
at
his
signal
whistle
they
sprang
forward
shouting
like
wild
indians
straight
for
the
oak
tree
they
charged
and
closed
in
on
the
group
beneath
it
those
seated
there
rose
to
their
feet
in
genuine
alarm
rush
shouted
bob
pushing
and
scrambling
those
in
the
attacking
party
began
to
force
the
others
down
the
narrow
path
the
boys
were
struggling
desperately
and
the
girls
were
resisting
as
best
they
could
and
some
were
crying
let
us
out
wept
ada
ow
you
stepping
on
me
let
us
out
she
kicked
blindly
and
fought
with
her
hands
the
first
person
she
grasped
was
ruth
who
was
nearly
choked
before
she
could
jerk
her
fur
collar
free
i
will
get
out
panted
ada
push
girls
the
circle
opened
for
them
and
following
ada
they
dashed
through
straight
into
a
tangle
of
blackberry
bushes
half
mad
with
rage
and
blind
from
excitement
they
ploughed
their
way
through
fighting
the
bushes
as
though
they
were
flesh
and
blood
arms
held
out
to
stop
them
when
they
were
clear
of
the
thicket
their
clothes
were
in
tatters
and
their
faces
and
hands
scratched
and
bleeding
cruelly
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
but
to
go
back
to
the
school
and
try
to
invent
a
plausible
story
for
their
condition
all
the
cold
cream
in
the
handsome
glass
jars
on
ada
dressing
table
could
not
heal
her
smarting
face
and
thoughts
that
night
bob
and
his
friends
continued
on
their
resolute
way
pushing
the
luckless
cadets
before
them
once
out
of
the
woods
they
seized
them
by
the
jacket
collars
and
rushed
them
down
to
the
lake
and
into
the
icy
waters
they
generously
allowed
them
to
come
out
after
a
few
minutes
immersion
and
the
sorry
dripping
crew
began
the
long
run
that
would
bring
them
to
dry
clothes
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
mended
ways
now
the
potatoes
are
done
bob
reported
after
examining
the
oven
hollowed
out
and
lined
with
stones
why
not
combine
forces
and
eat
every
one
was
famished
and
they
found
plenty
of
good
things
left
in
the
boxes
the
uninvited
guests
could
not
have
had
those
packages
open
long
before
they
were
overtaken
after
a
hearty
picnic
meal
the
boys
helped
the
girls
gather
up
their
branches
and
walked
with
them
to
the
point
where
their
boats
were
tied
they
had
rowed
over
because
of
the
attraction
of
the
woods
salsette
being
located
on
the
flat
side
of
the
lake
and
now
they
must
go
back
for
the
afternoon
drill
that
was
never
omitted
even
for
such
an
important
occasion
as
the
colonel
birthday
ada
and
her
chums
did
not
come
down
to
dinner
that
night
and
so
did
not
help
with
the
decorating
of
the
hall
that
was
pronounced
an
unqualified
success
as
was
the
performance
of
the
violet
patchwork
the
following
night
and
the
nut
cake
and
the
chocolate
and
the
pistache
that
was
served
at
the
close
both
audience
and
players
were
treated
to
two
surprises
in
the
course
of
the
evening
bobby
was
responsible
for
one
and
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
school
ada
nansen
and
constance
howard
for
the
other
true
to
her
promise
the
dauntless
bobby
had
accepted
the
humble
rôle
of
stage
hand
rather
than
have
no
part
in
the
play
and
she
trundled
scenery
with
right
good
will
and
acted
as
miss
anderson
right
hand
in
a
mood
of
unfailing
good
humor
there
was
not
an
atom
of
envy
in
bobby
character
and
she
thought
betty
the
most
wonderful
actress
she
had
ever
seen
you
look
lovely
in
that
dress
she
said
as
betty
stood
awaiting
her
cue
at
the
opening
of
the
second
act
betty
smiled
took
her
cue
and
walked
on
the
stage
a
ripple
of
laughter
that
grew
to
hilarity
greeted
her
after
the
first
puzzled
moment
oh
oh
cried
madame
hysterically
in
the
wings
see
that
bobby
some
one
call
her
she
is
walking
with
the
tree
the
rather
primitive
arrangements
of
the
background
provided
for
the
play
called
for
a
girl
to
stand
behind
each
tree
in
the
formal
garden
scene
as
support
in
her
admiration
of
betty
bobby
had
unconsciously
edged
after
her
to
keep
her
in
sight
and
the
startled
audience
saw
the
heroine
being
persistently
pursued
by
a
pretty
boxwood
tree
bobby
was
recalled
to
herself
the
tree
became
rooted
in
its
place
and
the
violet
patchwork
proceeded
smoothly
between
the
third
and
fourth
acts
the
lights
went
out
at
a
signal
and
to
the
general
surprise
for
the
players
had
known
nothing
of
what
was
to
come
a
velvety
voice
rolled
out
in
the
darkness
singing
the
words
of
a
maid
in
a
garden
green
a
song
a
great
singer
had
made
popular
that
season
it
ada
whispered
the
school
with
a
rustle
of
delight
no
one
else
can
sing
like
that
they
encored
her
heartily
and
she
responded
then
the
lights
flared
up
and
died
down
again
for
the
last
act
constance
got
her
to
do
it
whispered
betty
to
bobby
i
heard
miss
anderson
telling
miss
sharpe
ada
face
is
so
scratched
she
could
or
rather
would
show
herself
and
constance
said
why
not
sing
in
the
dark
the
way
they
do
at
the
movies
that
tickled
ada
who
like
to
be
a
movie
actress
connie
says
and
she
said
she
would
constance
howard
has
a
way
with
her
remarked
bobby
sagely
any
one
that
can
persuade
ada
nansen
to
do
anything
nice
is
qualified
to
take
a
diplomatic
post
in
thibet
soon
after
the
play
the
weather
turned
colder
and
skating
and
coasting
became
popular
topics
of
conversation
there
was
not
much
as
a
rule
in
that
section
of
the
country
but
snow
was
to
be
expected
and
more
than
one
girl
had
secret
aspirations
to
go
from
the
top
of
the
hill
back
of
the
school
as
far
as
good
fortune
would
take
her
coasting
ada
nansen
had
sniffed
when
the
subject
was
mentioned
to
her
why
that
for
children
girls
of
our
ages
do
go
coasting
now
at
home
my
brother
has
an
that
real
sport
well
ada
i
suppose
you
think
i
old
enough
to
be
your
grandmother
said
miss
anderson
laughing
i
wonder
what
you
say
when
i
tell
you
that
i
still
enjoy
a
good
coast
if
you
girls
who
think
you
are
too
old
to
play
in
the
snow
would
only
get
outdoors
more
you
would
complain
of
so
many
headaches
but
ada
refused
to
be
mollified
and
she
remained
indifferent
to
the
shrieks
of
delight
that
greeted
the
first
powdering
of
snow
thanksgiving
morning
saw
the
first
flakes
the
holiday
was
happily
celebrated
at
shadyside
very
few
of
the
girls
going
home
eustice
preferred
to
add
the
time
to
the
christmas
vacation
and
the
girls
had
found
that
this
plan
added
to
their
enjoyment
aunt
nancy
and
her
assistants
fairly
outdid
themselves
on
the
dinner
and
that
alone
would
have
made
the
day
memorable
for
those
with
good
appetites
and
where
is
the
school
girl
who
does
not
like
to
eat
the
dramatic
club
gave
another
play
to
which
the
salsette
boys
were
invited
as
a
special
treat
and
a
little
dance
followed
the
play
you
a
great
little
actress
betty
bob
told
her
when
he
came
to
claim
the
first
dance
i
almost
willing
to
let
you
steer
the
new
bobsled
the
first
time
it
snows
the
bobsled
built
by
bob
and
his
chums
was
an
object
of
admiration
to
half
of
salsette
academy
it
was
large
and
roomy
and
promised
plenty
of
speed
the
boys
of
course
were
wild
to
try
it
and
betty
and
bobby
who
had
been
promised
one
of
the
first
rides
joined
them
in
earnestly
wishing
for
snow
betty
had
a
sled
of
her
own
too
a
graceful
light
affair
her
uncle
had
sent
her
the
desired
snow
did
not
come
for
several
days
instead
the
weather
grew
still
and
cold
and
the
girls
were
glad
to
stay
indoors
and
work
on
their
lessons
or
on
things
they
were
making
for
christmas
gifts
you
may
not
have
much
money
to
spend
norma
remarked
bobby
one
afternoon
but
then
you
do
need
it
just
look
at
the
things
you
can
do
with
a
crochet
hook
and
a
knitting
needle
norma
bent
over
a
pretty
lace
pattern
flushed
a
little
i
like
to
be
able
to
give
grandma
the
things
she
needs
far
more
than
a
lace
collar
she
said
quietly
betty
knew
that
macklin
was
still
in
the
philadelphia
hospital
every
letter
from
glenside
now
meant
a
spell
of
the
blues
for
norma
who
was
beginning
to
have
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
she
looked
as
though
she
might
lie
awake
at
night
and
plan
when
the
girls
put
away
their
books
and
their
sewing
to
go
down
to
dinner
a
few
uncertain
feathery
flakes
were
softly
sifting
down
and
late
that
night
it
began
to
snow
in
earnest
promising
perfect
coasting
chapter
xxiv
betty
goes
coasting
it
did
seem
a
shame
that
lessons
should
be
as
exacting
as
ever
when
outside
the
trees
bent
beneath
their
white
burden
and
eager
eyes
were
fixed
longingly
on
the
hill
back
of
the
school
you
ca
coast
through
the
woods
anyway
betty
libbie
whispered
in
the
french
period
you
may
be
a
wonder
but
how
can
you
go
through
the
tree
stumps
do
intend
to
whispered
back
betty
there
a
cleared
space
in
there
i
show
you
young
ladies
if
you
please
suggested
madame
politely
and
the
girls
jerked
their
thoughts
back
to
translation
the
moment
lessons
were
over
that
afternoon
they
dashed
for
their
sleds
the
eight
who
chummed
together
had
four
sleds
between
them
which
was
enough
for
the
enjoyment
of
all
constance
howard
had
seen
so
little
snow
in
her
life
spent
in
california
that
she
was
very
much
excited
about
it
and
had
bought
her
sled
in
august
to
be
ready
for
the
first
fall
bobby
had
been
to
edentown
and
bought
a
little
toy
affair
the
best
she
could
get
there
and
frances
martin
had
sent
home
for
her
big
comfortable
sled
that
made
up
in
dependability
what
it
lacked
in
varnish
and
polish
counting
betty
this
gave
them
four
sleds
there
was
a
conventional
hill
half
a
mile
away
from
the
school
toward
which
most
of
the
girls
turned
their
steps
on
the
first
afternoon
it
was
crowded
the
salsette
cadets
had
come
coasting
too
for
on
their
side
of
the
lake
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
mound
of
earth
and
whoever
would
coast
must
perforce
cross
the
lake
we
go
up
to
the
woods
announced
betty
there
will
be
more
room
and
it
much
more
exciting
to
go
down
a
steep
hill
so
it
proved
the
cleared
space
to
which
betty
had
referred
demanded
careful
steering
and
frances
martin
at
the
first
glance
relinquished
the
control
of
her
sled
i
ca
judge
distances
she
explained
touching
her
glasses
and
i
be
sure
to
steer
straight
for
a
tree
libbie
you
have
to
be
the
skipper
so
libbie
took
frances
betty
took
bobby
constance
took
norma
on
her
sled
and
alice
steered
for
louise
using
bobby
sled
such
shrieks
of
laughter
such
wild
spills
if
ada
nansen
had
been
there
to
see
she
would
certainly
have
been
confirmed
in
her
statement
that
coasting
was
for
children
they
were
coming
down
for
the
sixth
time
when
bob
henderson
the
tucker
twins
and
timothy
derby
appeared
we
thought
we
find
you
here
was
bob
greeting
trust
betty
to
pick
out
a
mystic
maze
for
her
coasting
it
a
wonder
some
of
you
girls
have
shot
down
into
indian
chasm
well
i
like
a
steep
coast
said
betty
defensively
i
would
give
a
cent
a
hundred
for
a
little
short
coast
down
a
gentle
slope
want
me
to
take
you
down
on
my
sled
bob
i
do
believe
i
do
thank
you
just
the
same
returned
bob
politely
six
of
you
can
pile
on
the
bob
though
and
i
give
you
a
thrilling
ride
safety
guaranteed
who
wants
to
come
it
ended
by
all
taking
turns
and
by
that
time
it
was
four
and
they
must
start
back
to
school
i
coming
declared
betty
i
think
winter
is
the
nicest
time
of
the
whole
year
you
say
that
of
every
season
criticised
bobby
besides
i
think
it
will
rain
it
is
much
warmer
than
when
we
came
out
bobby
proved
a
good
weather
prophet
for
the
next
day
was
warmer
and
cloudy
and
when
lessons
for
the
day
were
over
at
two
a
fine
drizzle
had
begun
to
fall
just
the
same
i
going
persisted
betty
pulling
on
her
rubbers
and
struggling
into
a
heavier
sweater
the
snow
has
all
melted
and
there
will
be
enough
for
a
good
coast
i
think
you
a
lazy
bunch
to
want
to
stay
cooped
up
in
here
and
knit
a
little
fresh
air
would
be
good
for
you
norma
i
a
cold
said
norma
in
explanation
of
her
red
eyes
anyway
i
do
feel
like
playing
around
outdoors
and
alice
has
gone
to
bed
with
a
headache
and
i
rather
not
leave
her
some
had
studying
to
do
and
others
refused
to
be
moved
from
their
fancy
work
so
betty
and
her
sled
finally
set
off
alone
she
knew
of
course
that
norma
red
eyes
were
the
result
of
crying
as
was
alice
headache
they
had
definitely
decided
the
night
before
that
they
would
not
return
to
shadyside
after
the
christmas
holidays
i
think
this
is
a
funny
world
scolded
betty
to
herself
as
she
reached
her
favorite
hill
and
put
her
sled
in
position
here
are
norma
and
alice
the
kind
of
girls
eustice
is
proud
to
have
represent
the
school
and
they
ca
afford
to
take
a
full
course
and
graduate
and
ada
nansen
who
is
everything
the
ideals
of
shadyside
try
to
combat
has
oceans
of
money
and
every
prospect
of
staying
she
probably
take
a
course
a
wild
ride
through
the
slushy
snow
made
betty
feel
better
and
when
as
she
dragged
the
sled
up
again
bob
whistle
sounded
the
last
trace
of
her
resentment
vanished
something
told
me
you
be
out
hunting
a
sore
throat
declared
bob
in
the
fellows
all
said
there
would
be
enough
snow
to
hold
up
a
sparrow
silly
things
dimpled
betty
there
plenty
of
snow
for
a
good
coast
take
me
bob
well
if
you
come
on
over
where
there
a
decent
hill
bob
assented
with
only
two
on
the
bob
we
want
to
get
some
grade
here
i
stick
your
sled
in
between
these
two
trees
and
you
can
get
it
when
we
come
back
together
they
pulled
the
heavy
bobsled
up
the
hill
and
crossed
over
the
hollow
taking
a
wagon
trail
that
led
up
over
another
hill
it
a
long
walk
admitted
bob
panting
but
wait
till
you
see
the
ride
we
going
to
get
they
reached
the
top
of
pudding
hill
presently
and
betty
looked
down
over
a
rolling
expanse
of
white
country
covered
closely
by
a
lowering
gray
sky
that
looked
she
said
to
herself
like
the
lid
of
a
soup
kettle
bully
coast
exclaimed
bob
with
satisfaction
swinging
the
bodsled
into
position
all
ready
betsey
just
a
minute
begged
betty
with
a
delightful
little
shiver
of
excitement
as
she
tucked
in
her
skirts
and
pulled
her
soft
hat
further
over
her
eyes
now
i
guess
i
fixed
they
started
the
wind
sang
in
their
ears
and
sharp
particles
of
snow
flew
up
to
sting
their
faces
zip
they
had
taken
one
hill
and
the
gallant
bobsled
gathered
momentum
betty
clung
tightly
to
bob
all
right
he
shouted
without
turning
his
head
it
fine
shrieked
betty
it
takes
my
breath
away
but
i
love
it
the
bobsled
seemed
fairly
to
leap
the
series
of
gentle
slopes
that
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
long
hill
and
for
every
rise
betty
and
bob
received
a
bump
that
would
have
jarred
the
bones
of
less
enthusiastic
sportsmen
then
suddenly
they
were
in
the
hollow
and
the
next
thing
they
knew
betty
lay
breathless
in
a
soft
snow
bank
and
bob
found
himself
flat
on
his
back
a
few
feet
away
the
sled
had
overturned
with
them
betty
are
you
hurt
cried
bob
scrambling
to
his
feet
here
struggle
i
have
you
out
in
a
jiffy
he
pulled
her
from
the
bank
of
snow
and
helped
her
shake
her
garments
free
from
the
white
flakes
i
not
hurt
a
bit
not
even
scratched
she
assured
him
was
that
a
spill
though
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
was
sailing
through
space
and
i
thankful
i
landed
in
soft
snow
where
the
sled
oh
over
there
want
to
quit
asked
bob
as
she
began
to
help
him
right
the
overturned
sled
we
can
walk
over
to
where
we
left
your
sled
you
know
betty
and
miss
the
coast
said
betty
scornfully
well
not
much
bob
henderson
it
takes
more
than
one
upset
to
make
me
give
up
coasting
she
seated
herself
behind
bob
again
and
with
a
touch
of
his
foot
they
began
the
descent
of
the
second
hill
the
snow
had
melted
more
here
and
in
some
spots
the
covering
was
very
thin
bob
found
the
task
of
steering
really
difficult
i
do
think
much
of
this
he
began
to
say
but
at
the
second
word
the
bobsled
struck
a
huge
root
the
riders
were
pitched
forward
and
for
one
desperate
moment
they
clung
to
the
scrubby
undergrowth
that
bordered
what
they
supposed
was
the
side
of
the
road
then
their
hold
loosened
and
they
fell
slipping
sliding
tumbling
rolling
a
confused
sound
of
bob
shouts
in
her
ears
betty
closed
her
eyes
and
only
opened
them
when
she
found
that
she
was
stationary
again
she
had
no
idea
of
where
she
was
nor
of
how
far
she
had
fallen
bob
she
called
timidly
at
first
and
then
in
terror
bob
look
behind
you
said
bob
familiar
voice
betty
turned
her
head
and
there
was
bob
grinning
at
her
placidly
his
cap
was
gone
and
several
buttons
were
ripped
bodily
from
his
mackinaw
but
he
did
not
seem
to
be
injured
and
when
he
pulled
betty
to
her
feet
that
young
person
found
that
she
too
was
unhurt
what
happened
she
asked
where
are
we
the
bobsled
balked
explained
bob
cheerfully
guess
it
knew
where
we
were
heading
for
better
than
i
did
anyway
you
and
i
took
a
double
header
that
was
a
beauty
if
you
want
to
see
where
we
came
down
just
look
up
there
betty
followed
the
direction
of
his
finger
and
saw
a
trail
gashed
in
the
snow
a
trail
that
twisted
and
turned
down
the
steep
forbidding
sides
of
a
frowning
gorge
was
it
possible
that
they
had
fallen
so
far
and
escaped
injury
know
where
you
are
asked
bob
watching
her
betty
shook
her
head
i
must
have
been
away
off
the
road
explained
bob
betsey
you
and
i
are
standing
at
the
bottom
of
indian
chasm
chapter
xxv
the
treasure
indian
chasm
betty
stared
at
bob
in
dismay
afterward
she
confessed
that
her
first
thought
was
of
indians
who
might
capture
them
indian
chasm
repeated
bob
firmly
come
on
betty
we
must
stand
here
if
you
once
get
cold
there
no
way
to
warm
you
up
we
must
walk
and
try
to
find
a
way
out
betty
stumbled
after
him
her
mind
a
bewildered
maze
she
could
not
yet
grasp
the
explanation
that
bob
turned
about
by
their
spill
in
the
hollow
had
followed
an
old
trail
instead
of
the
hill
road
the
trail
had
led
straight
to
the
border
of
the
chasm
bob
ploughed
along
head
bent
a
heavy
sense
of
responsibility
keeping
him
silent
he
knew
better
than
betty
the
difficulties
that
in
all
probability
lay
before
them
he
glanced
back
at
betty
wearily
toiling
after
him
want
to
rest
a
moment
he
suggested
sit
on
that
rock
till
you
begin
to
feel
chilly
betty
accepted
the
suggestion
gratefully
she
was
very
tired
and
she
was
hungry
her
rubbers
had
been
torn
on
the
stones
she
had
encountered
in
her
fall
and
her
shoes
were
damp
what
a
funny
rock
she
said
idly
it
was
a
huge
slab
that
had
once
been
a
part
of
another
huge
rock
which
still
stood
upright
some
force
of
nature
had
slit
the
two
like
a
piece
of
paper
from
the
looks
of
it
the
break
was
a
recent
one
and
had
forced
a
section
outward
making
it
look
like
a
wall
about
to
topple
over
rested
a
little
betty
rose
and
walked
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
rock
on
which
she
sat
moved
by
an
impulse
of
curiosity
she
went
close
to
the
rock
that
stood
upright
like
a
sentinel
what
the
matter
called
bob
as
she
started
back
i
i
thought
i
kicked
against
something
answered
betty
there
did
you
hear
that
something
clinked
admitted
bob
wait
i
help
you
look
he
ran
around
to
her
and
together
they
began
to
dig
in
the
snow
and
dead
leaves
bob
bob
betty
voice
rose
in
delight
look
she
held
up
a
small
rusty
iron
box
that
as
she
tilted
it
yawned
to
disgorge
a
shower
of
gold
coins
the
macklin
treasure
we
found
it
cried
betty
beginning
to
dig
like
an
excited
terrier
help
me
hunt
bob
it
must
be
treasure
must
it
looks
that
way
admitted
bob
as
he
spoke
he
drew
something
from
under
the
shadow
of
the
rock
that
settled
the
question
immediately
something
that
sparkled
and
glittered
and
slipped
through
his
cold
red
fingers
like
glass
the
emeralds
breathed
betty
oh
bob
are
they
beautiful
look
betty
that
slab
was
forced
outward
not
long
ago
before
that
this
treasure
was
concealed
in
a
narrow
crack
between
the
two
rocks
why
no
one
was
able
to
find
it
when
the
search
was
made
soon
after
the
loss
is
it
great
that
we
have
found
it
in
a
frenzy
now
they
dug
and
when
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
more
hidden
under
the
accumulation
of
dirt
and
leaves
the
two
stared
at
each
other
in
delighted
amazement
at
their
feet
lay
little
jewel
bags
containing
the
pearls
of
which
norma
had
talked
the
rose
topazes
the
dozen
cameos
magnificent
diamonds
sparkled
in
a
rusty
case
and
rings
lay
in
a
little
heap
and
a
handful
of
uncut
stones
was
wrapped
in
a
bit
of
chamois
skin
solid
silver
pitchers
and
goblets
and
trays
sadly
battered
by
being
flung
against
the
rocks
lay
just
as
they
had
fallen
until
bob
and
betty
had
uncovered
the
leaves
which
had
so
long
covered
them
how
are
we
going
to
get
it
out
of
here
asked
betty
when
they
had
satisfied
themselves
there
was
nothing
left
undiscovered
that
the
pressing
question
confessed
bob
incidentally
we
have
to
get
ourselves
out
too
i
think
we
better
walk
on
a
bit
and
look
for
some
trail
out
one
lucky
thing
no
one
will
take
the
treasure
while
we
scouting
where
do
you
suppose
that
goes
to
said
betty
when
they
had
been
tramping
about
five
minutes
she
pointed
to
a
rocky
formation
that
led
off
into
the
side
of
the
chasm
it
was
evidently
the
mouth
of
a
cave
i
do
know
of
course
admitted
bob
but
i
think
we
had
better
take
a
chance
and
follow
it
it
will
be
dark
but
so
will
the
chasm
in
another
half
hour
i
go
first
and
you
come
after
me
it
was
inky
black
in
the
cave
and
there
was
no
assurance
that
it
would
lead
them
anywhere
and
every
prospect
that
they
would
have
to
retrace
their
steps
he
was
careful
to
hint
nothing
of
this
to
betty
however
and
she
on
her
part
determinedly
stifled
any
complaint
of
weariness
that
rose
to
her
lips
it
was
an
experience
they
both
remembered
all
their
lives
that
slow
halting
groping
through
the
winding
cavern
where
the
rocky
walls
narrowed
or
widened
without
warning
and
the
roof
rose
to
great
heights
or
dropped
so
low
they
must
crawl
on
hands
and
knees
the
thought
of
the
found
treasure
sustained
them
and
gave
them
courage
to
keep
on
i
see
a
light
cried
bob
after
what
seemed
to
betty
hours
of
this
betty
i
do
believe
we
come
to
an
opening
the
of
light
grew
and
broadened
and
as
they
approached
it
they
saw
it
was
the
winter
sky
the
sun
was
setting
for
the
clouds
had
cleared
and
never
was
a
sight
half
so
beautiful
to
the
anxious
eyes
that
rested
on
it
what
did
it
matter
that
they
were
miles
from
the
school
or
that
both
were
wet
and
cold
and
tired
to
the
point
of
collapse
just
to
get
out
of
that
awful
chasm
was
enough
i
go
get
your
sled
and
pack
the
stuff
on
that
proposed
bob
i
do
suppose
it
would
hurt
to
leave
it
there
all
night
but
somehow
i
ca
will
you
go
on
ahead
betty
you
so
tired
i
going
back
with
you
said
betty
firmly
i
could
rest
one
minute
knowing
you
were
crawling
through
that
awful
cave
again
oh
yes
i
coming
with
you
bob
you
need
shake
your
head
like
that
bob
realized
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
persuade
her
to
go
on
to
the
school
alone
his
common
sense
told
him
that
it
would
be
wiser
to
leave
the
treasure
where
it
was
and
come
after
it
the
next
day
but
common
sense
does
not
always
win
out
it
was
actually
impossible
for
bob
or
betty
to
abandon
the
macklin
fortune
now
that
they
had
found
it
bob
found
betty
sled
after
some
search
where
they
had
left
it
between
two
trees
and
together
they
began
to
thread
the
tortuous
maze
of
the
cave
again
bob
going
ahead
and
dragging
the
sled
after
him
betty
thought
despairingly
that
she
had
never
known
what
it
meant
to
be
tired
before
i
wrap
the
little
things
in
my
middy
tie
she
said
when
they
came
out
in
the
chasm
at
last
and
found
the
heap
of
treasure
where
they
had
piled
it
and
we
can
fasten
down
the
rest
of
the
stuff
with
the
belt
from
my
coat
their
fingers
were
stiff
with
cold
but
they
managed
to
get
everything
on
the
sled
and
lash
it
securely
with
a
rope
and
the
leather
belt
from
betty
coat
then
once
more
they
started
back
through
the
cave
the
sled
was
heavy
and
the
way
seemed
twice
as
long
as
the
first
time
they
had
followed
it
but
they
kept
doggedly
on
it
was
dark
when
they
emerged
on
the
familiar
hillside
sit
on
the
sled
and
i
pull
you
betty
offered
bob
looking
a
little
anxiously
at
his
companion
white
face
but
betty
resolutely
refused
and
she
trotted
beside
him
all
the
way
helping
to
pull
the
sled
till
the
gray
buildings
of
shadyside
loomed
up
before
them
she
insisted
that
bob
must
come
in
with
her
and
they
told
their
story
to
eustice
breathlessly
and
disconnectedly
to
be
sure
but
the
rope
of
emeralds
and
the
gleaming
diamonds
filled
in
all
gaps
in
the
narrative
before
she
went
to
sleep
betty
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
norma
and
alice
had
been
told
the
good
news
and
that
a
telegram
was
speeding
off
to
the
home
folks
the
discovery
and
recovery
of
the
missing
treasure
created
a
wave
of
excitement
when
it
became
generally
known
a
few
girls
who
valued
worldly
possessions
above
everything
else
made
overtures
of
friendship
to
the
sisters
whom
previously
they
had
ignored
their
old
friends
heartily
rejoiced
with
them
and
norma
and
alice
went
about
in
a
dream
of
bliss
compounded
of
joy
for
their
grandmother
and
parents
plans
for
new
frocks
and
the
proposed
holiday
trip
to
washington
it
the
nicest
thing
that
ever
happened
betty
wrote
her
uncle
now
norma
and
alice
can
graduate
from
shadyside
and
grandma
macklin
can
spend
the
rest
of
the
winter
in
florida
and
dear
doctor
and
guerin
can
doctor
and
nurse
half
the
county
for
nothing
if
they
please
doctor
guerin
and
his
wife
wrote
that
norma
and
alice
should
go
happily
with
the
littell
girls
for
a
visit
and
forget
the
no
longer
depressing
question
of
finances
both
doctor
and
guerin
were
enthusiastic
in
their
praise
of
betty
and
bob
who
began
to
feel
that
too
much
was
made
of
their
lucky
discovery
especially
when
at
the
direction
of
macklin
the
macklin
family
old
lawyer
who
had
taken
charge
of
the
recovered
treasure
and
appraised
it
at
nearly
twice
its
value
when
lost
sent
betty
a
pair
of
the
diamond
earrings
and
bob
one
of
the
priceless
old
silver
platters
but
you
not
only
found
it
you
went
through
a
lot
to
bring
it
to
us
said
norma
affectionately
no
betty
you
and
bob
ca
wriggle
out
of
being
thanked
the
finding
of
the
treasure
was
not
the
last
of
betty
adventures
what
happened
to
her
and
her
chums
the
following
summer
will
be
related
in
the
next
volume
of
this
series
the
remaining
days
of
the
term
fairly
flew
and
almost
before
they
realized
it
school
closed
for
the
christmas
holidays
a
merry
party
boarded
the
train
for
the
junction
where
they
could
make
connections
for
washington
one
crisp
sunny
december
morning
every

here

run
the
risk
of

tommy
tucker
who
knew
the
story
of
betty
first
meeting

bobby
both
girls
laughed
and
betty
was
still
smiling
as
she
held
out
her
ticket
to
the
conductor

a
good
time
young
chirped
the
grizzled
little
man
cheerily
only
one
thing

for

happy
prospect
