chapter
i
the
horse
thief
it
was
a
warm
summer
morning
in
the
town
of
farewell
save
a
dozen
horses
tied
to
the
in
front
of
various
saloons
and
the
blue
pigeon
store
and
bill
lainey
the
fat
landlord
of
the
hotel
who
sat
snoring
in
a
reinforced
telegraph
chair
on
the
sidewalk
in
the
shade
of
his
wooden
awning
main
street
was
a
howling
wilderness
dust
overlay
everything
it
had
not
rained
in
weeks
in
the
blacksmith
shop
diagonally
across
the
street
from
the
hotel
piney
jackson
was
shoeing
a
mule
the
mule
was
invisible
but
one
knew
it
was
a
mule
because
piney
jackson
has
just
come
out
and
taken
a
from
the
woodpile
behind
the
shop
and
it
was
a
fact
that
piney
never
used
a
on
any
animal
other
than
a
mule
but
this
by
the
way
in
the
barroom
of
the
happy
heart
saloon
there
were
only
two
customers
and
the
bartender
one
of
the
former
a
sunburnt
young
man
with
ingenuous
blue
eyes
was
singing
on
jog
on
the
footpath
way
an
merrily
jump
the
stile
o
yore
cheerful
heart
goes
all
the
day
yore
sad
tires
in
a
mile
racey
dawson
having
successfully
sung
the
first
verse
rested
both
elbows
on
the
bar
and
grinned
at
the
bartender
that
worthy
grinned
back
and
knowing
dawson
slid
the
bottle
along
the
bar
have
one
yoreself
bill
dawson
nodded
to
the
bartender
whu
where
swing
oh
yeah
dawson
head
up
chest
out
stepping
high
and
walking
very
stiffly
as
befitted
a
gentleman
somewhat
with
liquor
crossed
the
barroom
to
where
swing
tunstall
sat
on
a
chair
and
slumbered
his
head
on
his
arms
and
his
arms
on
a
table
dawson
stooped
and
blew
into
tunstall
right
ear
tunstall
began
to
snore
gently
growing
irritated
by
this
continued
indifference
on
the
part
of
tunstall
dawson
seized
the
chair
by
rung
and
back
and
incontinently
dumped
tunstall
all
abroad
on
the
saloon
floor
tunstall
promptly
hitched
himself
into
a
corner
and
drifted
deeper
into
slumber
dawson
turned
a
perplexed
face
on
the
bartender
now
what
you
gon
na
do
with
a
feller
like
that
dawson
asked
plaintively
jack
richie
manager
of
the
ranch
entering
at
the
moment
temporarily
diverted
dawson
attention
for
dawson
had
once
ridden
for
the
outfit
hence
he
was
moved
literally
to
fall
upon
the
neck
of
richie
lean
on
yore
own
breakfast
urged
richie
studiously
dissembling
his
joy
at
sight
of
his
old
friend
and
carefully
steering
dawson
against
the
bar
here
i
know
what
you
need
drink
hearty
racey
me
declared
dawson
everythin
on
me
i
money
i
have
and
i
aim
to
spend
it
free
an
plenty
there
more
where
i
goin
an
i
ai
gon
na
earn
it
punchin
cows
neither
do
do
anything
rash
richie
advised
and
took
advantage
of
a
friend
privilege
to
be
insulting
i
helped
lynch
a
only
last
month
which
the
business
is
too
easy
for
a
live
man
opined
dawson
we
want
somethin
me
an
swing
do
so
we
goin
to
arizona
where
the
gold
grows
no
more
cows
no
more
hard
work
for
us
gon
na
get
rich
quick
we
are
what
you
laughin
at
i
never
laugh
denied
richie
when
yo
stakin
out
claims
do
forget
me
we
wo
averred
dawson
solemnly
le
have
another
they
had
another
several
others
the
upshot
was
that
when
richie
who
was
the
lucky
possessor
of
a
head
that
liquor
did
not
easily
affect
departed
homeward
at
four
he
left
behind
him
a
sadly
plastered
dawson
tunstall
of
course
was
still
sleeping
deeply
and
noisily
but
dawson
had
long
since
lost
interest
in
tunstall
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
remembered
that
tunstall
existed
the
two
had
begun
their
party
immediately
after
breakfast
tunstall
had
succumbed
early
but
dawson
had
not
once
halted
his
efforts
to
make
the
celebration
a
huge
success
so
it
is
not
a
subject
for
surprise
that
dawson
some
thirty
minutes
after
bidding
richie
an
affectionate
farewell
should
stagger
out
into
the
street
and
ride
away
on
the
horse
of
someone
else
the
ensuing
hours
of
the
evening
and
the
night
were
a
merciful
blank
to
dawson
his
first
conscious
thought
was
when
he
awoke
at
dawn
on
a
a
sharp
rock
prodding
him
in
the
small
of
the
back
and
the
of
his
dozing
horse
wound
round
one
arm
only
it
was
not
his
horse
his
horse
was
a
red
roan
this
horse
was
a
bay
it
was
his
saddle
either
where
my
hoss
he
demanded
of
the
world
at
large
and
sat
up
suddenly
the
sharp
movement
wrung
a
groan
from
the
depths
of
his
being
the
loss
of
his
horse
was
drowned
in
the
pains
of
his
aching
head
never
was
such
ache
he
knew
the
top
was
coming
off
he
knew
it
he
could
feel
it
and
then
did
with
his
fingers
he
groaned
again
his
tongue
was
dry
as
cotton
and
it
hurt
him
to
swallow
he
stood
up
but
as
promptly
sat
down
in
a
whisper
for
speech
was
torture
he
began
to
revile
himself
for
a
fool
i
might
have
known
it
was
his
plaint
i
had
a
feelin
when
i
took
that
last
glass
it
was
one
too
many
i
never
did
know
when
to
stop
i
like
to
know
how
i
got
here
and
where
my
hoss
is
and
who
belongs
to
this
one
he
eyed
the
mount
with
disfavour
he
had
never
cared
for
bays
an
that
ai
much
of
a
saddle
either
he
went
on
with
his
soliloquy
cheap
saddle
looks
like
a
boy
saddle
an
a
old
saddle
bet
noah
used
one
just
like
it
try
to
rope
with
that
saddle
an
you
pull
the
horn
to
hellen
gone
wonder
what
in
that
he
pulled
himself
erect
slowly
and
tenderly
his
knees
were
very
shaky
his
head
throbbed
like
a
squeezed
boil
but
he
wanted
to
learn
what
was
in
that
possibly
he
might
obtain
therein
a
clue
to
the
horse
owner
he
slipped
the
strap
of
the
flipped
it
open
inserted
his
fingers
and
drew
forth
a
small
package
wrapped
in
newspaper
and
tied
with
the
blue
string
affected
by
the
blue
pigeon
store
in
farewell
dawson
balanced
the
package
on
two
fingers
for
a
reflective
instant
then
he
snapped
the
string
and
opened
the
package
socks
an
a
undershirt
he
said
disgustedly
and
started
to
say
more
but
paused
for
there
was
something
queer
about
that
undershirt
his
head
was
still
spinning
and
his
eyes
were
sandy
but
he
perceived
quite
plainly
that
there
were
narrow
blue
ribbons
running
round
the
neck
of
that
undershirt
he
unrolled
the
socks
and
found
them
much
longer
in
the
leg
than
the
kind
habitually
worn
by
men
dawson
agitatedly
dived
his
hand
once
more
into
the
and
this
time
he
pulled
out
a
shuttle
round
which
was
wrapped
several
inches
of
lingerie
edging
but
dawson
did
not
call
it
lingerie
edging
he
called
it
tatting
and
swore
again
that
settles
it
he
said
cheerlessly
i
stole
some
cayuse
chapter
ii
the
yellow
dog
it
was
a
chastened
racey
dawson
that
returned
to
farewell
he
went
directly
to

blacksmith
shop

him

the

home
on
that
old
dinner
of
a
accordeen
you
left
behind
racey
dawson
was
too
reduced
in
spirit
to
properly
take
umbrage
at
this
insult
to
his
horse
he
could
only
repeat
his
request
that
piney
make
not
of
himself
a
bigger
fool
than
usual
and
when
piney
did
nothing
but
laugh
immoderately
racey
grinned
foolishly
if
my
head
did
ache
so
hard
he
assured
the
chortling
blacksmith

kansas
casey
the
deputy
sheriff

racey
replied
frankly
who

question
yesterday
said
kansas
severely
but
with
a
twinkle
in
his
black
eyes
that
belied
his
tone
this
here
would
be
mighty
serious
business
for
you
if
the
sheriff

in
town
jake
so
particular
about

an
all
yessir
racey
i
expect

bawled
racey
and
immediately
batted
his
eyes
and
gingerly
patted
the
back
of
his
head
head
ache
queried
kansas
i
expect
it
might
after
last
night
you
go
give
that
hoss
back
like
a
good
boy
so
saying
kansas
casey
turned
his
back
and
retreated
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
the
starlight
saloon
racey
dawson
glared
vindictively
after
the
departing
deputy
then
he
switched
his
angry
blue
eyes
to
the
blacksmith
smiling
countenance
you
can
all
said
racey
dawson
distinctly
go
plumb
to
hell
he
turned
the
purloined
pony
on
a
dime
and
loped
up
the
street
followed
by
the
ribald
laughter
of
piney
jackson
they
think
they
so
terrible
funny
racey
muttered
mournfully
as
he
dismounted
and
tied
at
the
hitching
rail
in
front
of
the
happy
heart
now
if
i
can
only
find
swing
but
swing
tunstall
it
appeared
on
consulting
the
bartender
had
gone
off
hunting
him
racey
the
latter
did
not
appeal
to
the
bartender
to
divulge
the
name
of
the
horse
owner
he
had
he
believed
furnished
the
local
populace
sufficient
amusement
for
one
day
he
had
a
small
drink
for
he
felt
that
he
needed
a
bracer
and
with
the
liquor
he
imbibed
inspiration
miss
blythe
mike
flynn
partner
in
the
blue
pigeon
store
she
would
know
whose
horse
it
was
for
certainly
the
horse
owner
had
bought
the
undershirt
and
the
stockings
at
the
blue
pigeon
furthermore
miss
blythe
looked
like
a
individual
she
would
take
no
pleasure
in
devilling
a
man
not
she
racey
dawson
set
down
his
glass
and
hurried
to
the
blue
pigeon
store
miss
blythe
at
his
entrance
ceased
checking
tomato
cans
and
came
forward
said
racey
will

dejectedly
forth
to
effect
the
feeding
of

dale
horse
at
the
hotel
corral
for

breakfast
he
went
to

offered
no
objections
to

the
horse
lainey
utterly
refused
to

odd
hours
for
punchers
who
were
too
lazy
to
eat
at
the
regular
so
there
now
but
i
ai
gon
na
shave
he
told
himself
as
he
disposed
of
fried
steak
and
potatoes
sloshed
down
by
several
cups
of
coffee
if
she
a
old
maid
like
they
say
it
do
matter
how
tough
i
look
he
was
reflectively
stirring
the
grounds
in
the
bottom
of
his
sixth
cup
when
a
small
and
frightened
yellow
dog
dashed
into
the
restaurant
and
fled
underneath
racey
table
where
he
cowered
next
to
boots
and
cuddled
a
head
against
racey
knee
racey
had
barely
time
to
glance
down
and
discover
that
the
yellow
nondescript
was
no
more
than
a
pup
when
a
burly
youth
charged
into
the
restaurant
and
demanded
in
no
uncertain
tones
to
know
where
that
adjective
dog
had
hidden
himself
racey
took
an
instant
dislike
to
the
burly
youth
still
it
was
his
dog
and
it
is
a
custom
of
the
country
to
let
every
man
as
the
saying
is
skin
his
own
deer
he
that
takes
exception
to
this
custom
and
horns
in
on
what
can
not
rightfully
be
termed
his
particular
business
will
find
public
opinion
dead
against
him
and
his
journey
unseasonably
full
of
incident
racey
moved
a
leg
this
him
stranger
the
burly
youth
it
was
evident
that
he
was
not
wholly
sober
glared
at
racey
dawson
shore
it
him
he
declared
whatell
you
him
for
get
outa
the
way
whereupon
the
burly
youth
advanced
upon
racey
this
was
different
oh
quite
the
burly
youth
had
by
his
brusque
manner
and
rude
remarks
included
racey
in
his
the
burly
youth
business
racey
met
the
burly
youth
rather
more
than
halfway
he
hit
him
so
hard
on
the
nose
that
the
other
flipped
backward
through
the
doorway
and
landed
on
his
ear
on
the
sidewalk
racey
followed
him
out
the
burly
youth
bleeding
copiously
from
the
nose
sat
up
and
fumbled
uncertainly
for
his
gun
no
said
racey
with
decision
aiming
his
sixshooter
at
the
word
you
leave
that
gun
alone
and
lem
me
tell
you
stranger
while
together
that
i
want
to
buy

a
gent
like

the
burly
youth
which

racey
observed

suggested
the
other
do

just

nice
and
quiet
like

and

over
yore
head
the
boy
how
much
for

dog
feller
what

done
to
my
dog
a
woman
voice
broke
on
racey
ears
but
he
did
not
remove
his
slightly
narrowed
eyes
from
the
face
of
the
burly
youth
what
you
done
to
my
dog
the
question
was
repeated
and
the
speaker
came
close
to
the
burly
youth
and
looked
down
at
him
now
that
the
woman
was
within
his
range
of
vision
racey
perceived
that
she
was
the
happy
heart
lookout
a
creature
with
brown
hair
and
a
lithe
figure
the
girl
fists
were
clenched
so
tightly
that
her
knuckles
showed
whitely
against
the
pink
two
red
spots
flared
on
the
white
skin
of
her
cheeks
dam
yore
soul
swore
the
lady

the
burly
youth
he
never
was
yores
mine
you
which
last
was
putting
it
pretty
strongly
even
for
the
time
the
place
and
the
girl
she
promptly
swung
a
brisk
right
toe
kicked
the
burly
youth
under
the
chin
and
flattened
him
out
that
learn
you
to
call
me
names
she
snarled
so
long
as
i
act
like
a
lady
i
gon
na
be
treated
like
one
and
i
break
the
neck
of
the
man
who
acts
different
and
you
can
stick
a
pin
in
that
you
beast
muttering
profanely
true
to
form
the
aforementioned
beast
essayed
to
rise
but
here
again
racey
and
his
ready
gun
held
him
to
the
ground
in
a
sitting
position
you
leave
her
alone
commanded
racey
you
got
what
was
coming
to
yuh
let
it
go
at
that
the
lady
says

dog
anyway

averred
the
girl
you
kicked

out
when

took

in
and
tended
him
and
got
him
well
if
that
make
him
my
dog
what
does
correct
said
racey
call
him
the
girl
put
two
fingers
in
her
mouth
and
whistled
shrilly
forth
from
the
canton
came
the
dog
on
the
jump
and
bounced
into
the
girl
arms
and
began
to
lick
her
ear
with
despatch
and
enthusiasm
you
see
how
it
is
racey
indicated
to
the
man
on
the
ground
the
lady
dog
you
can
go
now
the
burly
youth
stared
stupidly
you
heard
what
i
said
racey
told
him
impatiently
go
else
get
outa
here
say
remarked
the
burly
youth
in
what
was
intended
to
be
a
menacing
growl
this
party
ai
over
yet
ai
you
been
enough
of
a
fool
already
interrupted
racey
you
ai
asking
for
it
are
you
you
ca
run
no
blazer
on
me
denied
the
other
furiously
racey
promptly
holstered
his
sixshooter
now
yore
best
time
he
said
quietly
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
there
was
a
rent
in
the
sleeve
of
shirt
and
the
burly
youth
sat
rocking
his
body
to
and
fro
and
groaning
through
gritted
teeth
for
there
was
a
hole
in
his
right
shoulder
which
hurt
him
considerably
racey
dawson
gazed
dumbly
down
at
the
muzzle
of
his
sixshooter
from
which
a
slim
curl
of
gray
smoke
spiralled
lazily
upward
then
his
eyes
veered
to
the
man
he
had
shot
and
to
the
man
sixshooter
lying
on
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
it
too
like
his
own
gun
was
thinly
smoking
at
the
muzzle
the
burly
youth
put
a
hand
to
his
shoulder
the
fingers
came
away
red
racey
was
glad
he
had
not
killed
him
he
had
not
intended
to
but
accidents
will
happen
he
stepped
forward
and
kicked
the
burly
youth
discarded
sixshooter
into
the
middle
of
the
street
he
looked
about
him
the
girl
and
her
dog
had
vanished
kansas
casey
had
taken
her
place
apparently
from
windows
and
doorways
along
the
street
peered
interested
faces
one
knew
that
they
were
interested
despite
their
careful
lack
of
all
expression
it
is
never
well
to
openly
express
approval
of
a
shooting
the
shooter
undoubtedly
has
friends
and
little
breaches
of
etiquette
are
always
remembered
racey
dawson
looked
at
kansas
casey
and
shoved
his
sixshooter
down
into
its
holster
it
was
an
even
break
announced
racey
shore
kansas
nodded
i
seen
it
there
be
no
trouble
from
us
he
added
significantly
the
deputy
sheriff
knelt
beside
the
wounded
man
racey
dawson
went
into
the
happy
heart
he
felt
that
he
needed
a
drink
when
he
came
out
five
minutes
later
the
burly
youth
had
been
carried
away
remained
a
stain
of
dark
red
on
the
sidewalk
where
he
had
been
sitting
piggy
wadsworth
the
plump
owner
of
the
legs
widespread
and
arms
akimbo
was
inspecting
the
red
stain
thoughtfully
he
was
joined
by
the
storekeeper
calloway
and
two
other
men
none
of
them
was
aware
of
racey
dawson
standing
in
front
of
the
happy
heart
was
it
there
inquired
calloway
yeah
said
piggy
right
there
i
seen
the
whole
fraycas
racey
stood
here
an
at
this
point
racey
dawson
went
elsewhere
chapter
iii
the
tall
stranger
you
have
to
manage
it
yoreself
lanpher
the
manager
of
the
ranch
was
speaking
and
there
was
finality
in
his
tone
you
mean
you
do
wan
na
appear
in
the
deal
sneered
his
companion
racey
dawson
who
had
been
kneeling
on
the
ground
engaged
in
bandaging
a
cut
from
a
kick
on
the
near
foreleg
of
the
dale
pony
when
the
two
men
led
their
horses
into
the
corral
craned
his
neck
past
the
chest
and
glanced
at
lanpher
tall
companion
for
the
latter
words
provoked
curiosity
what
species
of
deal
was
toward
having
ridden
for
lanpher
in
the
days
preceding
his
employment
by
the
and
consequently
provided
with
many
opportunities
for
studying
the
gentleman
at
racey
naturally
assumed
that
the
deal
was
a
shady
one
personally
he
believed
lanpher
capable
of
anything
which
of
course
was
unjust
to
the
manager
his
courage
was
not
quite
sufficient
to
hold
him
abreast
of
the
masters
in
wickedness
but
he
was
mean
and
cruel
in
a
slimy
way
and
if
left
alone
was
prone
to
make
life
miserable
for
someone
invariably
the
someone
was
incapable
of
proper
defense
from
farewell
to
marysville
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
great
lazy
river
country
lanpher
was
known
unfavourably
and
disliked
accordingly
to
his
companion
sneering
remark
lanpher
made
no
intelligible
reply
he
merely
grunted
as
he
reached
for
the
gate
to
pull
it
shut
his
companion
half
turned
his
back
had
from
the
first
been
toward
racey
dawson
and
racey
perceived
the
cold
and
roman
profile
of
a
head
then
the
man
turned
full
in
his
direction
and
behold
the
hard
features
vanished
and
the
man
displayed
a
countenance
of
singular
charm
the
chin
was
a
thought
too
wide
and
heavy
a
trait
it
shared
in
common
with
the
mouth
but
otherwise
the
stranger
full
face
would
have
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
almost
any
woman
however
critical
racey
dawson
at
first
minded
to
reveal
his
presence
in
the
corral
thought
better
of
it
almost
immediately
while
not
by
habit
an
eavesdropper
he
felt
no
shame
in
fortuitously
overhearing
anything
lanpher
or
the
stranger
might
be
moved
to
say
lanpher
merited
no
consideration
under
any
circumstances
and
the
stranger
in
appearance
a
similar
breed
of
dog
as
far
as
morals
went
certainly
deserved
no
better
treatment
so
racey
remained
quietly
where
he
was
and
was
glad
that
besides
the
pony
to
whom
he
was
ministering
there
were
several
others
between
him
and
the
men
at
the
gate
why
do
you
wan
na
appear
in
this
business
persisted
the
stranger
pivoting
on
one
heel
in
order
to
keep
face
to
face
with
lanpher
i
got
ta
live
here
was
the
lanpher
reply
well
ai
i
got
ta
live
here
too
and
i
do
see
anything
round
here
to
worry
me
old
chin
whisker
does
go
on
the
prod
what
can
he
do
right
mumbled
lanpher
shutting
the
gate
and
shoving
home
the
bar
you
do
know
this
country
as
well
as
i
do
i
got
trouble
enough
running
the
without
borrowing
any
more
now
i
told
you

peaceable
if
i
could
i
got
it
all
planned
out
i

do
anything
rough
unless

gotto
but
i
gon
na
get
old

and
you

the
only
hoss

ride
if
you
think
that
other
outfit
is
gon
na
watch
you
pick
daisies
in
their
front
yard
without
doing
anything
you
got
another
guess
but
i
do
what
i
said
and
no
more
i
you
think
that
by
sticking
away
off
yonder
where
the
grass
is
long
nobody
will
suspicion
you
if
you
do
yo
crazy
folks
so
as
all
that
not
so
dam
loud
lanpher
cautioned
excitedly
say
whatsa
matter
with
you
demanded
the
stranger
leaning
back
against
the
gate
and
spreading
his
long
arms
along
the
top
bar
which
yo
the
most
nervous
gent
i
ever
did
see
the
hotel
ai
close
enough
for
anybody
to
hear
a
word
and
there
only
hosses
in
the
corral
get
of
yoreself
do
be
so
skittish
i
ai
skittish
i
sensible
i
know
lanpher
broke
off
abruptly
what
do
you
know
what
yo
due
to
find
out
now
lookit
here
lanpher
said
the
stranger
in
a
low
cold
tone
you
said
those
last
words
a
leetle
too
gayful
to
suit
me
if
planning
any
skulduggery
do
i
ai
not
a
bit
of
it
but
i
got
my
duty
to
my
company
i
get
mixed
up
in
any
fraycas
on
yore
account
because
if
i
do
my
ranch
will
lose
money
that
the
flat
of
it
oh
it
is
huh
yore
ranch
will
lose
money
if
you

me
up
hey
and
you
ai
thinkin
nothin
of

oh
no
not
i
wonder
what
yore
company
would
say
to
the
deal
between
you
and
me
that
started
this
business
i
wonder
what
think
of
lanpher
and
his
sense
of
duty
yeah
i
would
wonder
a
whole
lot
well
began
lanpher
lamely
hell
snarled
the
stranger
you
make
me
sick
now
you
listen
to
me
yo
in
this
as
deep
as
i
am
if
you
think
you
ai
try
to
pull
yore
wagon
out
just
try
it
thassall
i
ai
doing
none
of
the
work
that
flat
lanpher
denied
doggedly
you
got
ta
back
me
up
alla
same
declared
the
stranger
that
was
in
the
bargain
fenced
lanpher
it
is
now
chuckled
the
stranger
if
i
lose
you
lose
too
lookit
he
added
in
a
more
conciliatory
tone
ca
you
see
how
it
is
i
need
you
an
you
need
me
all
i
asking
of
you
is
to
back
me
up
when
i
want
you
to
outside
of
that
you
can
sit
on
yore
and
enjoy
life
we
did
bargain
on
that
harked
back
lanpher
but
that
was
then
and
this
is
now
which
may
not
be
logic
but
it
necessity
an
necessity
lanpher
is
the
mother
of
all
kinds
of
funny
things
so
you
and
i
we
got
to
ride
together
lanpher
pushed
back
his
hat
and
looked
over
the
hills
and
far
away
the
carking
care
was
written
large
upon
his
countenance
slowly
his
eyes
slid
round
to
meet
for
a
brief
moment
the
eyes
of
his
companion
i
ca
answer
for
my
men
said
lanpher
shortly
can
you
answer
for
yoreself
inquired
the
stranger
quickly
i
back
you
up
grudgingly
then
that
all
right
you
can
keep
the
men
from
throwing
in
with
the
other
side
anyway
ca
you
i
can
do
that
much
which
is
quite
a
lot
for
a
ranch
manager
to
be
able
to
do
was
the
stranger
blandly
sarcastic
observation
we
gassed
so
much
i
dry
as
a
covered
bridge
i
what
does
thompson
want
now
punch
jack
howdy
lanpher
racey
could
not
see
the
newcomer
but
he
recognized
the
voice
it
was
that
of
thompson
a
gentleman
well
known
to
make
his
living
by
the
ingenious
capitalization
of
an
utter
lack
of
moral
virtue
say
jack
continued
thompson
nebraska
has
been
plugged
plugged
great
amazement
on
the
part
of
the
stranger
plugged
who
done
it
feller
by
the
name
of
dawson
racey
dawson
nipped
in
lanpher
yeah
him
lanpher
chuckled
slightly
why
the
laugh
asked
jack
harpe
i
always
thought
nebraska
could
shoot
nebraska
is
supposed
to
be
some
swift
admitted
the
stranger
it
happen
punch
thompson
told
him
and
on
the
whole
gave
a
truthful
account
what
kind
of
feller
is
this
dawson
the
stranger
inquired
after
a
moment
silence
following
the
close
of
the
story
a
skipjack
of
a
promptly
replied
lanpher
he
thinks
he
hell
on
the
wabash
allasame
he
must
be
old
pie
to
put
the
kybosh
on
nebraska
thataway
luck
sneered
lanpher
just
luck
is
he
square
probed
the
stranger
square
as
a
said
lanpher
why
jack
he
so
crooked
he
ca
lay
in
bed
straight
at
which
racey
dawson
was
moved
to
rise
and
declare
himself
then
the
humour
of
it
struck
him
he
grinned
and
hunkered
down
his
ears
on
the
stretch
well
said
the
stranger
refraining
from
comment
on
estimate
of
the
dawson
qualities
we
have
to
get
somebody
in
nebraska
place
i
as
good
as
nebraska
thompson
stated
modestly
no
the
stranger
said
decidedly
yo
all
right
punch
but
even
if
we
can
get
old
chin
whisker
drunk
the
hand
has
got
ta
be
quicker
than
the
eye
y
understand
thompson
it
appeared
did
understand
he
grunted
sulkily
we
have
to
give
peaches
austin
a
show
resumed
the
stranger
nemmine
giving
me
a
argument
punch
i
said
i
use
austin
le
go
get
a
drink
the
three
men
moved
away
racey
dawson
cautiously
eased
his
long
body
up
from
behind
the
pony
with
slightly
narrowed
eyes
he
stared
at
the
gate
behind
which
jack
harpe
and
his
two
friends
had
been
standing
now
i
wonder
mused
racey
dawson
i
shore
am
wonderin
what
kind
of
skulduggery
lanpher
of
the
is
to
crawl
out
of
and
what
stranger
is
to
drag
him
into
nebraska
too
huh
i
was
wondering
what
that
feller
name
was
he
knelt
down
again
and
swiftly
completed
the
bandaging
of
the
cut
on
the
pony
near
fore
as
he
rode
round
the
corner
of
the
hotel
to
reach
main
street
he
saw
luke
tweezy
into
town
from
the
south
the
powdery
dust
of
the
trail
filled
in
and
overlaid
the
lines
and
creases
of
luke
tweezy
and
leathery
visage
layers
of
dust
almost
completely
concealed
the
original
colour
of
the
caked
and
matted
hide
of
luke
tweezy
horse
it
was
evident
that
luke
tweezy
had
come
from
afar
in
common
with
most
range
riders
racey
dawson
possessed
an
automatic
eye
to
detail
quite
without
conscious
effort
his
brain
registered
and
filed
away
in
the
of
his
subconscious
mind
the
picture
presented
by
the
passing
of
luke
tweezy
the
impression
made
thereby
and
the
inference
drawn
therefrom
the
inference
was
almost
trivial
merely
that
luke
tweezy
had
come
from
marysville
the
town
where
he
lived
and
had
his
being
but
triviality
is
frequently
paradoxical
and
always
relative
if
dundee
had
not
raised
an
arm
to
urge
his
troopers
on
at
killiekrankie
the
world
would
know
a
different
england
a
single
thread
it
was
that
solved
for
theseus
the
mystery
of
the
cretan
labyrinth
racey
dawson
did
not
like
luke
tweezy
from
the
sparse
and
sandy
strands
of
the
tweezy
hair
to
the
long
and
varied
lines
of
the
tweezy
business
there
was
nothing
about
tweezy
that
he
did
like
for
luke
tweezy
business
was
ready
money
and
its
possibilities
he
drove
hard
bargains
with
his
neighbours
and
harder
ones
with
strangers
he
bought
county
scrip
at
a
liberal
discount
and
lent
his
profits
to
the
needy
at
the
highest
rate
allowed
by
law
luke
tweezy
knowledge
of
what
was
allowed
by
territorial
law
was
not
limited
to
he
had
been
admitted
to
the
bar
and
no
case
was
too
small
too
large
or
too
filthy
for
him
to
handle
in
his
dislike
of
luke
tweezy
racey
dawson
was
not
solitary
luke
tweezy
was
as
generally
unpopular
as
lanpher
of
the
but
there
was
a
difference
where
lanpher
list
of
acquaintances
nodding
and
otherwise
was
necessarily
confined
to
the
lazy
river
country
luke
tweezy
knew
almost
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
territory
it
was
his
business
to
know
everybody
and
luke
tweezy
was
always
attending
to
his
business
he
had
nodded
and
spoken
to
racey
dawson
as
they
two
passed
and
racey
had
returned
the
greeting
gravely
slimy
ol
racey
dawson
observed
to
himself
and
reached
for
his
tobacco
but
there
was
no
tobacco
the
sack
that
he
knew
he
had
put
in
his
vest
pocket
after
breakfast
had
vanished
lack
of
tobacco
is
a
serious
matter
racey
wheeled
his
mount
and
spurred
to
the
blue
pigeon
store
five
minutes
later
smoking
a
grateful
cigarette
he
again
started
to
ride
out
of
town
as
he
curved
his
horse
round
a
freight
wagon
in
front
of
the
blue
pigeon
he
saw
three
men
issue
from
the
doorway
of
the
happy
heart
saloon
two
of
the
men
were
lanpher
and
the
stranger
the
third
was
luke
tweezy
the
latter
stopped
at
the
saloon
to
untie
his
horse
see
yuh
later
luke
the
stranger
flung
over
his
shoulder
to
luke
tweezy
as
he
passed
on
he
and
lanpher
headed
diagonally
across
the
street
toward
the
hotel
it
seemed
odd
to
racey
dawson
that
luke
tweezy
by
no
word
or
sign
made
acknowledgment
of
the
stranger
remark
racey
tickled
his
mount
with
the
rowels
of
one
spur
and
stirred
him
into
a
trot
have
to
be
moving
along
if
he
wanted
to
get
there
some
time
that
day
he
wished
he
did
have
to
go
alone
so
he
did
the
old
lady
would
surely
lay
him
out
and
he
wished
for
company
to
share
his
misery
why
could
swing
tunstall
have
stayed
reasonably
in
farewell
instead
of
traipsing
off
over
the
range
like
a
tomfool
might
not
be
back
for
a
week
swing
might
idiotic
caper
with
other
adjectives
of
swing
anyway
why
had
he
used
his
head
oh
racey
dawson
was
an
exceedingly
irritable
young
man
as
he
rode
out
of
farewell
the
aches
and
pains
were
still
throbbingly
alive
in
his
own
particular
head
the
immediate
future
was
not
alluring
it
was
a
hard
world
when
he
and
his
mount
were
breasting
the
first
slight
rise
of
the
northern
slope
of
indian
ridge
which
ridge
marks
with
its
long
bulk
the
southern
boundary
of
the
flats
south
of
farewell
and
forces
the
marysville
trail
to
travel
five
miles
to
go
two
a
rider
emerged
from
a
small
draw
wherein
tamaracks
grew
thinly
racey
stared
and
forgot
his
irritation
and
his
headache
the
draw
was
not
more
than
a
distant
and
he
perceived
without
difficulty
that
the
rider
was
a
woman
she
quirted
her
mount
into
a
gallop
and
then
seesawed
her
right
arm
vigorously
above
the
pattering
drum
of
her
horse
hoofs
a
shout
came
faintly
to
his
ears
he
pulled
up
and
waited
when
the
woman
was
close
to
him
he
saw
that
it
was
the
happy
heart
lookout
the
girl
whose
dog
he
had
protected
she
dragged
her
horse
to
a
halt
at
his
side
and
smiled
and
oddly
enough
it
was
an
amazingly
sweet
smile
it
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
hard
smile
of
her
profession
i
sorry
i
had
to
leave
without
thanking
you
for
what
you
done
for
me
back
there
said
she
with
a
jerk
of
her
head
toward
distant
farewell
why
that
all
right
racey
told
her
awkwardly
it
meant
a
lot
to
me
she
went
on
her
smile
fading
you
let
that
feller
hurt
me
or
my
dog
and
i
think
the
world
of
that
dog
yeah
thus
racey
very
much
embarrassed
by
her
gratitude
and
quite
at
a
loss
as
to
the
proper
thing
to
say
yes
and
i
shore
grateful
stranger
i
i
wo
forget
it
that
dog
he
likes
me
he
does
and
i
teaching
him
tricks
he
awful
cunnin
and
company
say
when
i
feeling
rotten
that
there
dog
and
he
climbs
up
in
my
lap
and
licks
my
ear
and
tries
his
best
to
be
a
comfort
i
tell
you
that
dog
likes
me
and
that
means
a
whole
lot
to
me
i
i
ai
forgetting
it
her
face
was
dark
red
she
dropped
her
head
and
began
to
fumble
with
her
reins
you
need
come
riding
alla
way
out
here
just
for
this
chided
racey
feeling
that
he
must
say
something
to
relieve
the
situation
it
was
only
this
she
denied
tiredly
they
was
something
else
and
i
could
talk
to
you
in
farewell
without
him
and
his
friends
finding
it
out
that
why
i
borrowed
one
of
mike
flynn
hosses
followed
you
thisaway
so
we
could
be
private
le
ride
along
i
expect
you
was
going
somewhere
they
rode
southward
side
by
side
a
space
of
time
in
silence
racey
had
nothing
to
say
he
was
too
busy
speculating
as
to
the
true
significance
of
the
girl
presence
what
did
she
want
money
these
saloon
floozies
always
did
he
hoped
she
would
want
much
for
he
ruefully
knew
himself
to
be
a
fool
that
was
never
able
to
resist
a
woman
appeal
he
glanced
at
her
covertly
her
little
chin
was
trembling
poor
kid
that
all
she
was
just
a
kid
helluva
life
for
a
kid
shucks
lookit
here
said
racey
suddenly
you
in
hard
luck
huh
do
you
worry
yore
luck
is
bound
to
turn
it
always
does
how
much
you
want
so
saying
he
slid
a
hand
into
a
of
his
trousers
the
girl
shook
her
head
without
looking
at
him
it
ai
money
she
said
dully
i
make
enough
to
keep
me
going
then
with
a
curious
flash
of
temper
she
continued
that
always
the
way
with
a
man
ai
it
if
he
thinks
yo
in
trouble
give
her
some
money
if
yo
sick
give
her
money
if
yo
dyin
give
her
money
money
money
money
i
so
sick
of
money
i
do
mind
me
stranger
i
do
mean
nothing
i
a
a
upset
i
it
hard
for
me
to
begin
begin
what
was
the
girl
driving
at
yes
said
she
it
hard
i
ai
no
snitch
i
never
was
even
when
i
had
no
use
for
a
man
like
now
but
but
you
stuck
up
for
me
and
my
dog
and
i
got
ta
pay
you
back
i
got
ta
listen
she
pursued
swiftly
do
you
know
who
that
feller
was
you
shot
no
racey
shook
his
head
but
you
do
owe
me
anything
forget
it
i
dunno
what
yo
drivin
at
and
i
do
wan
na
know
if
it
bothers
you
to
tell
me
but
if
i
can
do
anything
anything
to
help
you
why
then
tell
me
i
know
she
nodded
you
always
help
a
feller
yo
that
kind
but
i
all
right
that
jigger
you
plugged
is
tom
jones
the
girl
looked
at
racey
dawson
as
though
the
name
of
tom
jones
should
have
been
informative
of
much
but
fieldings
excluded
there
are
many
tom
joneses
racey
did
not
react
dunno
him
denied
racey
dawson
i
heard
his
name
was
nebraska
nebraska
is
what
the
boys
call
him
she
said
he
used
to
be
foreman
of
the
currycomb
outfit
south
of
fort
seymour
i
heard
of
nebraska
jones
and
the
currycomb
bunch
all
right
he
admitted
soberly
and
i
shore
like
to
know
was
the
matter
with
nebraska
so
would
i
were
lucky
racey
nodded
absently
the
currycomb
outfit
that
charming
aggregation
of
gunfighters
had
borne
the
hardest
reputation
extant
in
a
neighbouring
territory
regarding
the
currycomb
men
had
been
accustomed
to
speak
behind
their
hands
and
under
their
breaths
for
the
currycomb
politically
had
been
a
power
which
perhaps
was
the
why
although
the
rustling
of
many
and
many
a
cow
and
the
killing
of
more
than
one
man
were
laid
at
their
unfriendly
door
nothing
had
ever
been
proved
against
them
they
had
prospered
exceedingly
these
currycomb
boys
till
the
election
of
an
opposition
sheriff
which
election
had
put
heart
into
the
more
decent
set
and
a
crimp
in
the
currycomb
it
did
not
matter
that
legally
the
currycomb
possessed
a
clean
bill
of
health
the
community
had
decided
that
the
currycomb
must
be
abolished
it
was
cow
cayuse
and
cowboy
while
some
had
remained
on
the
premises
at
an
approximate
depth
beneath
the
grass
of
two
feet
for
the
ground
was
hard
the
other
currycombers
had
scattered
wide
and
far
and
their
accustomed
places
knew
them
no
more
now
it
seemed
that
at
least
one
of
the
currycomb
boys
and
that
one
the
most
notorious
character
of
the
lot
had
scattered
as
far
as
farewell
and
obtruded
his
personality
upon
that
of
racey
dawson
nebraska
jones
a
cold
smile
stretched
the
corners
of
racey
mouth
as
he
thought
on
what
he
had
done
he
had
beaten
to
the
draw
the
foreman
of
the
currycomb
which
undoubtedly
must
have
been
the
first
time
nebraska
had
ever
been
shaded
the
girl
was
watching
his
face
do
begin
to
get
the
notion
you
beat
him
to
it
she
advised
divining
his
thought
he
was
stunned
sort
of
that
first
time
an
the
second
time
his
gun
caught
a
little
nebraska
is
slow
lightnin
on
the
pull
keep
thinkin
you
was
lucky
like
you
done
at
first
racey
laughed
shamefacedly
yo
too
much
of
a
mind
reader
for
me
but
what
you
telling
all
this
to
me
for
i
ai
the
sheriff
with
a
warrant
for
nebraska
jones
i
telling
you
so
you
know
what
to
expect
so
you
get
out
of
town
and
stay
out
because
shore
as
yo
a
foot
high
you
wo
live
a
minute
longer
than
is
plumb
necessary
if
you
do
i
beat
nebraska
once
and
he
wo
get
well
of
that
lead
in
the
shoulder
so
soon
can
you
beat
a
shot
in
the
dark
can
you
dodge
a
knife
in
the
night
it
ai
a
question
of
nebraska
jones
himself
it
the
gang
managed
to
pick
up
in
this
town
they
are
meaner
than
a
nest
of
cross
rattlesnakes
i
know
i
know
what
they
do
right
this
minute
they
fixing
up
some
way
to
give
you
yore
think
so
think
so
say
would
i
come
traipsing
out
here
just
for
my
health
or
yores
figure
it
out
seems
like
you
know
a
lot
about
nebraska
and
his
gang
he
cast
at
a
venture
glancing
at
her
sharply
i
lived
with
nebraska
for
a
while
she
said
giving
him
a
calm
stare
marie
knows
all
they
is
to
know
about
nebraska
jones
and
a
little
bit
more
which
goes
double
for
his
gang
shucks
racey
grunted
contemptuously
does
he
and
his
gang
run
farewell
i
always
thought
farewell
was
a
man
size
town
they
careful
explained
the
girl
they
got
sense
enough
not
to
run
any
blazers
they
ca
back
to
the
limit
yeah
careful
now
now
huh
later
when
they
filled
their
hands
and
there
more
of
playin
they
might
not
be
so
careful
huh
marie
unless
yo
a
heap
careful
right
now
you
wo
have
a
thing
to
do
with
she
parried
you
do
like
i
say
mister
man
i
ai
a
bit
anxious
to
see
you
wiped
out
wiping
me
out
would
shore
cramp
my
style
he
admitted
i
at
this
juncture
hoofbeats
sounded
sharply
on
the
trail
behind
them
racey
turned
in
a
flesh
his
right
hand
dropping
but
it
was
only
lanpher
and
the
stranger
riding
out
of
a
belt
of
pines
whose
deep
and
lusty
soughing
had
drowned
the
noise
of
their
approach
lanpher
and
his
comrade
rode
by
at
a
trot
the
former
mumbled
a
greeting
to
racey
but
barely
glanced
at
the
girl
women
did
not
interest
lanpher
he
was
too
selfishly
stingy
the
stranger
was
more
appreciative
he
gave
the
girl
a
stare
of
frank
admiration
before
he
looked
at
racey
dawson
the
latter
perceived
that
the
stranger
eyes
were
remarkably
black
and
keen
perceived
too
that
the
man
as
he
rode
past
and
on
half
turned
in
the
saddle
for
a
second
look
at
the
girl
who
yore
friend
asked
marie
an
insolent
lift
to
her
upper
lip
and
a
slightly
puzzled
look
in
her
brown
eyes
as
her
gaze
followed
the
stranger
and
lanpher
friend
said
racey
speaking
personal
now
i
ai
lost
either
of
i
know
who
lanpher
is
she
told
him
impatiently
i
meant
the
other
i
never
tell
yuh
i
dunno
him
i
think
i
seen
him
somewhere
sometime
i
ca
remember
where
or
how
i
see
so
many
men
there
i
almost
had
it
gone
again
now
it
make
you
sick
when
things
get
away
from
you
like
that
makes
you
think
yo
yore
mind
almost
he
looked
at
you
almighty
strong
proffered
racey
maybe
remember
why
do
you
ask
him
maybe
i
will
at
that
said
she
didja
know
he
was
a
friend
of
nebraska
he

of

the
girl
angrily
at
which
racey
dawson
laughed
aloud

on
the
instant
she
jerked

pony
round

her
quirt
and
tore
down
the
at
full
gallop
aw
hell
said
racey
looking
after
the
fleeing
damsel
regretfully
i
clean
forgot
to
ask
her
about
the
rest
of
nebraska
friends
chapter
iv
the
old
lady
hope
old
man
dale
is
home
said
racey
to
himself
when
he
saw
ahead
of
him
the
grove
of
cottonwoods
marking
the
location
of
moccasin
spring
but
he
wo
be
he
added
lugubriously
i
never
did
have
any
luck
he
passed
the
grove
of
trees
and
opened
up
the
prospect
of
house
and
stable
and
corral
with
cottonwood
and
soogan
creek
in
the
background
changed
some
since
i
was
here
last
he
muttered
in
wonder
for
nesters
as
a
rule
do
not
go
in
for
flowers
and
shrubs
and
here
besides
a
small
truck
garden
were
both
all
giving
evidence
of
much
care
and
attention
racey
dismounted
at
the
corral
and
approached
the
kitchen
door
a
fresh
young
voice
in
the
kitchen
was
singing
a
song
to
the
brave
accompaniment
of
a
twanging
banjo
i
was
down
the
road
with
a
tired
team
an
a
heavy
load
i
cracked
my
whip
an
the
leader
sprung
an
he
almost
busted
the
wagon
tongue
turkey
in
the
straw
ha
ha
ha
turkey
the
singing
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
line
the
banjo
went
silent
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
racey
looked
in
at
the
kitchen
door
and
saw
sitting
on
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
table
a
very
pretty
girl
one
knee
was
crossed
over
the
other
in
her
lap
was
the
mute
banjo
and
she
was
looking
straight
at
him
racey
heartily
and
internally
cursing
himself
for
having
neglected
to
shave
pulled
off
his
hat
and
achieved
a
good
morning
said
the
pretty
girl
putting
up
a
slim
tanned
hand
and
tucking
in
behind
a
ear
a
strayed
lock
of
black
hair
mornin
said
racey
and
decided
then
and
there
that
he
had
never
before
seen
eyes
of
such
a
deep
dark
blue
or
a
mouth
so
alluringly
red
what
said
the
pretty
girl
laying
the
banjo
on
the
table
and
sliding
down
till
her
feet
touched
the
floor
what
can
i
do
for
you
stuttered
the
rattled
racey
clasping
his
hat
to
his
bosom
so
that
he
could
button
unseen
the
top
button
of
his
shirt
except
you
find
miss
dale
for
me
is
she
home
mother
out
so
father
i
the
only
one
home
it
yore
sister
i
want
dale
yore
oldest
sister
you
must
mean
morgan
she
lives
no
i
do
mean
her
yore
sister
miss
her
whose
hoss
was
taken
by
mistake
in
farewell
yesterday
that
was
my
horse
yores
but
they
said
it
was
an
lady
hoss
are
you
shore
it
of
course
i
sure
did
you
bring
him
back
where
the
corral
the
girl
walked
swiftly
to
the
window
took
one
glance
at
the
bay
horse
tied
to
the
corral
gate
and
returned
to
the
table
certainly
that
horse
she
reiterated
with
the
slightest
of
smiles
racey
dawson
stared
at
her
in
horror
her
horse
he
had
actually
run
off
with
the
horse
of
this
beautiful
being
he
had
thereby
caused
inconvenience
to
this
angel
if
he
could
only
crawl
off
somewhere
and
pass
away
quietly
at
the
moment
by
his
own
valuation
any
one
buying
him
for
a
nickel
would
have
been
liberally
overcharged
her
horse
i
i
took
yore
hoss
he
spoke
up
desperately
i
racey
dawson
so
you
the
man
she
began
and
stopped
he
nodded
miserably
his
contrite
eyes
on
the
toes
of
her
shoes
small
shoes
they
were
cheerfully
would
he
have
lain
down
right
there
on
the
floor
and
let
her
wipe
those
selfsame
shoes
upon
him
it
would
have
been
a
positive
pleasure
he
felt
so
he
almost
wriggled
slowly
oh
very
slowly
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
her
face
i
i
was
drunk
he
confessed
hoping
that
an
honest
confession
would
restrain
her
from
casting
him
into
outer
darkness
i
heard
you
were
she
admitted
i
thought
it
was
yore
oldest
sister
pony
he
bumbled
on
feeling
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
say
something
they
told
me
something
about
an
old
lady
jane
morgan
the
only
other
sister
i
have
who
told
you
this
wild
tale
them
was
his
vague
reply
he
was
not
the
man
to
give
away
the
jokers
of
farewell
old
lady
indeed
miss
blythe
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
this
girl
was
not
within
sight
of
yeah
he
went
on
they
shore
fooled
me
told
me
i
taken
an
old
hoss
and
oh
as
far
as
that
goes
said
the
girl
her
long
eyelashes
demurely
drooping
they
told
you
the
truth
i
an
old
maid
you
shucks
hugely
contemptuous
oh
but
i
am
she
insisted
raising
her
eyes
and
tilting
sidewise
her
charming
head
i
not
married
thank
he
began
impulsively
but
choked
on
the
second
word
and
gulped
hard
i
mean
he
resumed
hastily
i
do
understand
why
i
never
saw
you
before
i
was
here
once
but
you
were
around
when
were
you
here
why
that
was
two
years
ago
i
was
only
a
kid
then
all
legs
like
a
calf
no
wonder
you
did
notice
me
she
laughed
at
him
frankly
with
a
bewildering
flash
of
white
teeth
i
shore
must
been
blind
he
said
truthfully
they
ai
any
two
ways
about
under
his
admiring
gaze
a
slow
blush
overspread
her
smooth
cheeks
she
laughed
again
uncertainly
and
burst
into
swift
speech
my
manners
what
have
i
been
thinking
of
dawson
please
sit
down
do
i
know
you
must
be
tired
after
your
long
ride
take
that
chair
under
the
mirror
it
the
strongest
you
can
tip
it
back
against
the
wall
if
you
like
i
get
you
a
cup
of
coffee
i
know
you
thirsty
sorry
mother
and
father
are
home
but
mother
drove
over
to
the
bar
s
on
business
and
i
do
know
where
father
went
i
ai
fit
to
stay
hesitated
racey
rasping
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
stubbly
chin
nonsense
you
sit
right
down
while
i
grind
the
coffee
i
have
you
a
potful
in
no
time
i
make
pretty
good
coffee
if
i
do
say
it
myself
i
bet
you
do
but
my
sister
jane
makes
better
you
get
some
of
hers
at
dinner
dinner
he
stared
blankly
of
course
dinner
when
mother
and
father
are
away
i
always
go
down
there
for
my
meals
it
only
a
down
stream
shorter
if
you
climb
that
ridge
but
it
so
stony
i
generally
go
along
the
creek
bank
where
i
can
gallop
what
why
of
course
you
going
with
me
jane
would
never
forgive
me
if
i
did
bring
you
and
what
would
chuck
say
if
you
came
this
far
and
then
did
go
on
down
to
his
house
do
you
suppose
he
enjoys
seeing
his
old
friends
it
was
only
last
week
i
heard
him
wonder
to
father
if
you
were
ever
coming
back
to
this
country
how
did
you
like
it
up
at
the
bend
right
fine
he
told
her
settling
himself
comfortably
in
the
chair
she
had
indicated
but
a
feller
gets
tired
of
one
place
after
a
while
i
thought
maybe
i
come
back
to
the
lazy
river
and
get
a
job
ridin
the
range
again
are
there
any
ranches
round
the
bend
she
asked
poking
up
the
fire
and
setting
on
the
plenty
but
i
i
like
the
lazy
river
country
he
told
her
fort
creek
country
for
yores
truly
now
and
hereafter
in
this
fashion
did
the
proposed
journey
to
arizona
go
glimmering
his
eye
lingered
on
the
banjo
where
it
lay
on
the
table
can
you
play
it
she
asked
her
eye
following
his
some
said
he
want
to
hear
a
song
she
nodded
he
rose
and
picked
up
the
banjo
he
placed
a
foot
on
the
chair
seat
slid
the
banjo
to
rest
on
his
thigh
swept
the
strings
and
broke
into
inchin
along
which
ditty
made
her
laugh
for
it
is
a
funny
song
and
he
sang
it
well
that
was
fine
she
told
him
when
he
had
sung
it
through
your
voice
sounds
a
lot
like
that
of
a
man
i
heard
singing
in
farewell
yesterday
he
was
in
the
happy
heart
when
i
was
going
by
and
he
sang
on
jog
on
the
footpath
if
it
had
been
a
saloon
i
have
gone
in
i
just
the
old
songs
you
do
said
he
delightedly
with
shining
eyes
well
miss
dale
that
feller
in
the
saloon
was
me
and
old
songs
is
where
i
live
i
cut
my
teeth
on
barley
mow
and
grew
up
with
allen
my
mother
she
used
to
sing
all
she
was
a
great
hand
to
sing
and
she
taught
me
know
keel
row
she
did
so
he
sang
it
for
her
and
others
he
sang
too
the
merry
cuckoo
and
the
bailiff
daughter
the
last
she
liked
so
well
that
he
sang
it
three
times
over
and
they
quite
forgot
the
coffee
racey
dawson
was
starting
the
second
verse
of
sourwood
mountain
when
someone
without
coughed
apologetically
racey
stopped
singing
and
looked
toward
the
doorway
standing
in
the
sunken
log
that
served
as
a
doorstep
was
the
stranger
he
had
seen
with
lanpher
there
was
more
than
a
hint
of
amusement
in
the
black
eyes
with
which
the
stranger
was
regarding
racey
the
latter
felt
that
the
stranger
was
enjoying
a
hearty
internal
laugh
at
his
expense
as
probably
he
was
racey
looked
at
him
from
beneath
level
brows
the
lid
of
the
stranger
right
eye
dropped
ever
so
little
it
was
the
merest
of
winks
yet
it
was
unmistakable
it
recalled
their
morning
meeting
more
it
was
the
tolerant
wink
of
a
superior
to
an
inferior
a
wink
that
merited
a
kick
quite
so
the
keen
black
eyes
veered
from
racey
to
the
girl
the
man
removed
his
hat
and
bowed
with
it
must
be
said
not
a
little
grace
miss
dale
nodded
coldly
the
stranger
smiled
it
was
marvellous
how
the
magic
of
that
smile
augmented
the
attractive
good
looks
of
the
stranger
full
face
it
was
equally
singular
how
that
smile
rendered
more
than
ever
the
hard
and
roman
profile
of
the
fellow
it
was
precisely
as
though
he
were
two
different
men
at
one
and
the
same
time
does
dale
live
here
inquired
the
stranger
he
does
a
breath
from
the
boreal
pole
was
in
the
two
words
uttered
by
miss
dale
the
stranger
smile
widened
the
keen
black
eyes
began
to
twinkle
he
made
as
if
to
enter
but
went
no
farther
than
the
placing
of
one
foot
on
the
doorsill
is
he
home
he
is
clear
and
colder
i
shore
sorry
grieved
the
stranger
the
smile
waning
a
trifle
i
wanted
to
see
him
i
supposed
as
much
sniffed
miss
dale
uncordially
yes
miss
said
the
stranger
undisturbed
when
will
he
be
back
if
i
might
ask
i
not
sure
so
i
see
nodded
the
stranger
would
it
be
worth
while
my
waitin
that
depends
on
what
you
call
worth
while
you
right
it
does
standards
ai
always
alike
are
they
he
laughed
silently
and
pulled
on
his
hat
and
it
a
good
thing
standards
ai
all
alike
he
resumed
chattily
would
it
be
a
funny
old
world
if
they
were
the
smile
of
him
recognized
racey
briefly
but
it
rested
upon
and
caressed
the
girl
she
shook
her
shoulders
as
if
she
were
ridding
herself
of
the
touch
of
hands
the
stranger
continued
to
smile
and
to
look
as
if
he
expected
a
reply
but
he
did
not
get
it
miss
dale
stared
calmly
at
him
through
him
slowly
the
stranger
slid
his
foot
from
the
doorsill
to
the
doorstep
slowly
very
slowly
his
keenly
twinkling
black
gaze
travelled
over
the
girl
from
her
face
to
her
feet
and
up
again
to
finally
fasten
upon
and
hold
as
with
a
tangible
grip
her
angry
blue
eyes
i
sorry
yore
pa
ai
here
he
resumed
in
a
drawl
i
had
some
business
it
can
wait
i
be
back
so
long
the
stranger
turned
and
left
them
from
the
kitchen
window
they
watched
him
mount
his
horse
and
ford
the
creek
and
ride
away
westward
i
do
like
that
man
declared
miss
dale
and
caught
her
lower
lip
between
her
white
teeth
i
wonder
what
he
wanted
you
find
out
when
he
comes
back
dryly
i
hope
he
never
comes
back
i
never
want
to
see
him
again
do
you
know
him
not
me
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
was
this
morning
in
farewell
he
was
with
lanpher
when
i
was
coming
out
here
he
and
lanpher
caught
up
with
me
and
passed
me
he
did
bring
lanpher
here
with
him
anyhow
he
did
for
a
fact
assented
racey
dawson
his
eyes
following
the
dwindling
figures
of
the
rider
and
his
horse
i
wonder
why
i
wonder
too
thus
miss
dale
with
a
gurgling
chuckle
both
laughed
for
racey
sole
visit
to
the
dale
place
had
been
made
in
company
with
lanpher
the
cause
of
said
visit
had
been
the
rustling
and
butchering
of
an
cow
which
lanpher
had
essayed
to
fasten
upon
dale
but
due
to
the
interference
of
chuck
morgan
a
bar
s
rider
who
later
married
jane
dale
lanpher
attempt
had
been
unavailing
it
may
be
said
in
passing
that
lanpher
had
suffered
both
physically
and
mentally
because
of
that
visit
of
course
he
had
neither
forgiven
chuck
morgan
nor
the
bar
s
for
backing
up
its
puncher
which
it
had
done
to
the
limit
i
quit
the
that
day
racey
dawson
told
the
girl
i
know
you
did
chuck
told
me
look
at
the
time
will
you
get
your
hat
we
must
keep
jane
waiting
no
he
said
thoughtfully
his
brows
puckered
we
must
keep
jane
waitin
lookit
miss
dale
as
i
remember
yore
pa
he
had
a
moustache
has
he
still
got
it
miss
dale
puzzled
paused
in
the
doorway
why
no
she
told
him
he
wears
a
horrid
chin
whisker
now
he
does
huh
a
chin
whisker
let
be
movin
right
along
i
think
i
got
something
interesting
to
tell
you
and
yore
sister
and
chuck
but
they
did
not
move
along
they
halted
in
the
doorway
or
rather
the
girl
halted
in
the
doorway
and
racey
looked
over
her
shoulder
what
stopped
them
short
in
their
tracks
was
a
spectacle
the
spectacle
of
an
elderly
man
very
drunk
and
disorderly
riding
in
on
a
paint
pony
father
breathed
miss
dale
in
a
whisper
and
as
she
spoke
father
uttered
a
string
of
cheerful
whoops
and
topped
off
with
a
long
pull
at
a
bottle
he
had
been
brandishing
in
his
right
hand
please
go
said
miss
dale
to
racey
dawson
he
hesitated
he
was
in
a
quandary
he
did
not
relish
leaving
her
with
at
that
instant
dale
decided
racey
course
for
him
dale
pulled
a
gun
and
still
whooping
cheerily
shook
five
shots
into
the
atmosphere
then
dale
fumblingly
threw
out
his
cylinder
and
began
to
reload
i
better
get
his
gun
away
from
him
racey
said
apologetically
over
his
shoulder
as
he
ran
forward
but
the
old
man
would
have
none
of
him
he
cunningly
discerned
an
enemy
in
racey
and
tried
to
shoot
him
it
was
lucky
for
racey
that
the
old
fellow
was
as
drunk
as
a
fiddler
or
certainly
racey
would
have
been
buried
the
next
day
as
it
was
the
first
bullet
went
wide
by
a
yard
the
second
went
straight
up
into
the
blue
for
by
then
racey
had
the
old
man
wrist
there
there
soothed
racey
you
do
want
that
gun
nawsir
not
you
le
have
it
that
a
good
feller
now
so
speaking
he
twisted
the
sixshooter
from
the
old
man
grasp
and
jammed
it
into
the
waistband
of
his
own
trousers
the
old
man
burst
into
frank
tears
incontinently
he
slid
sidewise
from
the
saddle
and
clasped
racey
round
the
neck
wild
an
woolly
an
full
o
fleas
i
hard
to
curry
below
the
thus
he
carolled
loudly
two
lines
of
the
justly
popular
song
luke
he
bawled
switching
from
verse
to
prose
why
didja
leave
me
luke
strangely
enough
he
did
not
stutter
without
the
slightest
difficulty
he
leaped
that
pitfall
of
the
drunken
the
letter
luke
repeated
racey
dawson
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
this
about
luke
you
mean
luke
tweezy
the
old
man
rubbed
his
adown
racey
i
mean
luke
tweezy
he
said
lots
o
folks
do
like
luke
they
say
he
mean
but
they
ai
nothin
mean
about
luke
he
frien
mine
luke
is
dawson
said
molly
dale
at
racey
elbow
please
go
i
can
get
him
into
the
house
you
can
do
no
good
here
i
can
do
lots
o
good
here
declared
racey
who
felt
sure
that
he
was
on
the
verge
of
a
discovery
somebody
is
to
jump
yore
ranch
and
if
you
lem
me
talk
to
him
i
can
find
out
who
it
is
who
how
said
miss
dale
stupidly
for
what
with
the
fright
and
embarrassment
engendered
by
her
father
condition
the
true
significance
of
racey
remark
was
not
immediately
apparent
yore
ranch
repeated
racey
sharply
they
to
steal
it
from
you
you
lem
me
talk
to
him
look
out
grab
his
bridle
miss
dale
seized
the
bridle
of
her
father
horse
in
time
to
prevent
a
runaway
she
was
not
aware
that
the
horse
attempt
to
run
away
had
been
inspired
by
racey
surreptitiously
and
severely
kicking
it
on
the
fetlock
this
he
had
done
that
miss
dale
thoughts
might
be
temporarily
diverted
from
her
father
anything
to
keep
her
from
shooing
him
away
as
she
so
plainly
wished
to
do
racey
began
to
assist
the
dale
toward
the
house
what
this
about
luke
tweezy
prodded
racey
did
you
see
him
shore
i
seen
him
burbled
the
drunken
one
he
left
me
at
mcfluke
after
buyin
me
the
bottle
and
asked
me
to
stay
there
till
he
got
back
but
i
got
tired
waitin
so
i
come
along
i
hic
come
along
limply
the
man
whole
weight
sagged
down
against
racey
supporting
arm
and
he
began
to
snore
shucks
muttered
racey
then
stooping
he
picked
up
the
limp
body
in
his
arms
and
carried
it
to
the
house
he
asleep
he
called
to
miss
dale
where
i
put
him
i
show
you
she
said
with
a
break
in
her
voice
she
hastily
tied
the
pony
to
a
young
cottonwood
growing
at
the
corner
of
the
house
and
preceded
racey
into
the
kitchen
here
she
said
her
eyes
meeting
his
a
fleeting
instant
as
she
threw
open
a
door
giving
into
an
inner
room
on
the
bed
she
turned
back
the
counterpane
and
racey
laid
her
snoring
parent
on
the
blanket
expertly
he
pulled
off
the
man
boots
and
stood
them
side
by
side
against
the
wall
had
to
take
off
now
or
his
feet
would
swell
so
after
you
never
get
off
he
said
in
justification
of
his
conduct
she
held
the
door
open
for
him
to
leave
the
room
she
did
not
look
at
him
nor
did
she
speak
i
going
now
he
said
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
but
i
wish
you
would
shut
that
door
just
yet
i
oh
ca
you
see
you
not
wanted
here
her
voice
was
shaking
the
door
was
open
but
a
crack
he
could
not
see
her
i
know
he
said
gently
but
you
do
understand
how
serious
this
business
is
i
had
good
reason
for
believing
that
somebody
is
trying
to
steal
yore
ranch
from
several
things
yore
dad
said
i
shorer
than
ever
if
i
could
only
talk
to
you
a
while
at
this
she
came
forth
her
eyes
were
downcast
her
cheeks
were
red
with
shamed
blood
she
leaned
against
the
table
one
closed
fist
rested
on
the
top
of
the
table
the
knuckles
showed
white
she
was
trembling
a
little
where
and
what
is
mcfluke
he
asked
oh
that
where
he
got
it
she
exclaimed
bitterly
i
guess
if
you
would
mind
telling
me
where
mcfluke
is
it
a
little
saloon
and
store
on
the
marysville
road
at
the
lazy
river
ford
it
new
since
my
time
then
it
been
in
operation
maybe
a
year
and
a
half
what
makes
you
think
someone
is
trying
to
steal
our
ranch
lots
o
things
he
told
her
briskly
but
they
ai
gon
na
do
it
if
i
can
help
it
do
you
fret
it
will
all
come
out
right
shore
it
will
ca
help
it
but
tell
me
how
what
you

she
demanded
i
have
time
now
unless
you

with
me
to
see
chuck
i
ca
now
then
you
ask
chuck
later
i
tell
him
all
about
it
you
ask
him
so
long
racey
hurried
out
and
caught
up
his
own
horse
he
swung
into
the
saddle
and
spurred
away
down
stream
chapter
v
they
been
after
him
to
sell
a
long
time
said
chuck
morgan
rolling
a
cigarette
as
he
and
racey
dawson
jogged
along
toward
mcfluke
at
the
ford
of
the
lazy
who
asked
racey
i
dunno
ca
find
out
luke
tweezy
is
the
agent
and
he
wo
give
the
party
name
has
old
salt
tried
to
buy
him
out
not
as
i
know
of
why
should
he
he
knows
he
wo
sell
to
anybody
have
they
been
after
you
too
not
yet
dad
dale
the
lad
they
want
special
my
ranch
would
be
a
good
thing
but
it
ai
noways
necessary
like
dale
is
to
anybody
startin
a
big
brand
lookit
the
way
dale
lays
right
across
the
valley
between
them
two
ridges
like
a
cork
in
a
bottle
a
mile
wide
here
twenty
mile
away
between
funeral
slue
and
cabin
hill
she
a
good
thirty
mile
wide
one
cracking
big
triangle
of
the
best
grass
in
the
territory
all
free
range
but
without
dale
section
and
his
water
rights
to
begin
with
what
good
is
it
not
much
conceded
racey
and
nobody
would
dast
to
start
a
brand
between
funeral
slue
and
cabin
hill
pursued
chuck
free
range
or
not
it
as
good
as
belongs
to
the
bar
old
salt
used
to
run
quite
a
bunch
round
cabin
hill
and
another
north
near
the
slue
he
does
yet
one
or
two
thousand
head
in
all
maybe
oh
these
fellers
ai
foolish
enough
to
crowd
old
salt
that
close
they
know
dale
is
their
best
chance
racey
eyes
travelled
from
one
ridge
to
the
other
how
come
they
allowed
dale
to
take
up
a
he
inquired
they
did
was
the
answer
the
section
is
made
up
of
four
claims
jane
molly
an
mis
dale
but
they
proved
up
now
and
made
over
to
him
all
regular
that
how
come
have
silvertip
ransom
and
long
oscar
got
a
claim
over
yonder
on
dale
land
inquired
racey
looking
toward
the
northerly
ridge
they
had
but
they
got
discouraged
and
sold
out
to
dale
the
same
time
slippery
wilson
and
his
wife
traded
in
their
claims
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
to
old
salt
and
tom
loudon
none
of
worth
anything
though
racey
nodded
dale
ever
drink
much
was
his
next
question
he
used
to
before
he
come
here
but
he
took
the
cure
and
quit
the
first
he
had
since
he
hit
this
country
that
it
then
luke
gave
him
the
redeye
so
he
be
easy
meat
for
the
butcher
does
he
ever
gamble
any
shore
before
he
came
west
jane
done
told
me
how
back
east
in
mcpherson
kansas
he
used
to
go
the
limit
forty
ways
liquor
cards
the
whole
layout
o
hellraising
but
his
habits
rode
him
to
a
frazzle
final
and
he
knuckled
under
to
tooberclosis
and
they
only
saved
his
life
by
fetchin
him
west
all
of
us
thought
he
was
cured
for
good
now
luke
tweezy
has
started
him
off
so
nebraska
peaches
austin
i
mean
can
get
in
his
fine
work
it
plain
enough
shore
assented
chuck
morgan
yonder
mcfluke
he
added
nodding
toward
two
log
and
shake
shacks
and
a
stockaded
corral
roosting
on
the
high
ground
beyond
the
belt
of
cottonwoods
and
willows
marking
the
course
of
the
lazy
them
his
stables
and
corral
went
on
chuck
the
house
she
down
near
the
river
see
her
on
account
of
the
cottonwoods
and
they
ca
see
us
count
of
the
cottonwoods
so
unless
he
at
the
corral
i
take
the
chance
chuck
you
stay
here
down
that
draw
is
a
good
place
i
go
on
alone
mcfluke
do
know
me
maybe
i
can
find
out
something
see
bimeby
you
come
along
maybe
you
know
me
either
i
get
into
conversation
with
you
you
follow
my
lead
we
pull
mcfluke
in
if
we
can
between
the
two
of
us
well
anyhow
we
see
what
he
says
chuck
morgan
nodded
and
turned
his
horse
aside
toward
the
draw
ten
minutes
later
the
water
of
the
lazy
river
was
sluicing
the
dust
from
the
legs
and
belly
of
racey
dawson
horse
racey
spurred
up
the
bank
and
rode
toward
the
long
low
building
that
was
mcfluke
store
and
saloon
there
were
no
ponies
standing
at
the
in
front
of
the
place
for
this
racey
was
devoutly
thankful
if
he
could
only
catch
mcfluke
by
himself
as
racey
dismounted
at
the
rail
a
man
came
to
the
open
doorway
of
the
house
and
looked
at
him
he
was
a
man
dewlapped
like
a
bloodhound
and
his
hard
blue
eyes
were
the
reptilian
forehead
did
not
signify
a
superior
mentality
even
as
the
slack
retreating
chin
denoted
a
minimum
of
courage
it
was
a
most
contradictory
face
the
features
did
not
balance
racey
dawson
was
not
a
student
of
physiognomy
but
he
recognized
a
weak
chin
when
he
saw
it
if
this
man
were
indeed
mcfluke
then
he
racey
dawson
was
in
luck
without
a
word
the
man
turned
from
the
doorway
racey
heard
him
walking
across
the
floor
and
for
so
heavy
a
man
his
step
was
amazingly
light
racey
went
into
the
house
the
room
he
entered
was
a
large
one
in
front
of
a
side
wall
tiered
to
the
low
ceiling
with
shelves
bearing
a
sorry
assortment
of
ranch
supplies
was
the
store
counter
across
the
back
of
the
room
ran
the
long
bar
behind
the
bar
flanking
the
door
giving
into
another
room
were
two
shelves
heavily
stocked
with
rows
of
bottles
the
man
that
had
come
to
the
door
was
behind
the
bar
his
hands
were
resting
on
top
of
it
and
he
was
staring
fixedly
and
fishily
at
racey
dawson
there
was
no
welcome
in
his
face
nor
was
there
any
unfriendliness
it
was
simply
exceedingly
expressionless
racey
draped
himself
against
the
bar
liquor
said
he
having
absorbed
a
short
one
he
poured
himself
a
second
have
one
with
me
he
nodded
to
the
man
all
right
the
man
tone
was
as
expressionless
as
his
face
hell
he
filled
and
drank
racey
looked
about
the
room
where
old
man
dale
he
asked
casually
he
got
away
on
me
replied
the
man
he
say
with
sudden
suspicion
who
are
you
are
you
mcfluke
shot
back
racey
the
man
nodded
slowly
suspicion
continuing
to
brighten
his
hard
blue
eyes
then
what
didja
let
him
get
away
for
persisted
racey
luke
tweezy
said
he
left
him
here
and
he
said
he
stay
here
that
was
yore
job
to
see
he
here
who
are
began
the
suspicious
mcfluke
nemmine
who
i
am
rapped
out
racey
who
believed
he
had
formed
a
correct
estimate
of
mcfluke
i
somebody
who
knows
more
about
this
deal
than
you
do
and
that
enough
for
you
to
know
why
did
you
hold
old
man
dale
i
he
got
away
on
me
knuckled
down
mcfluke
i
was
in
the
kitchen
gettin
me
some
coffee
and
when
i
come
back
he
had
dragged
it
luke
tweezy
will
be
tickled
to
death
with
you
said
racey
dawson

trouble
for
i
could
help
it
could
i

old
man
dale
was
gon
na
slide
off
when
i
left
him
he
was
all
so
happy
with
his
bottle

root
for
life
anyway
peaches
austin
oughta

before
the
old
man

he
was
supposed
to
come
and
he
did
if

blamed
on
peaches

and
i
wish
to
gawd
he
was
never

the
man
tone
was
so
earnest
that
racey
looked
at
him
startled
why
not
he
asked
coldly
because
i
do
wan
na

between
us
and

i
tell
you
i
do
like
it
it
too
damn
dangerous
shore
it
dangerous
assented
racey
slowly
revolving
his
glass
between
his
thumb
and
fingers
and
wondering
how
far
he
dared
go
with
this
mcfluke
person
but
a
gent
has
to
live
he
do
have
to
get
himself
killed
doin
it
snarled
mcfluke
swabbing
down
the
bar
who
that
he
went
to
the
doorway
to
see
for
himself
who
it
was
that
rode
so
briskly
on
the
marysville
trail
peaches
austin
he
sneered
only
about
three
hours
late
it
was
now
or
never
racey
risked
all
on
a
single
cast
what
did
the
boss
say
when
him
and
lanpher
got
here
and
found
old
dale
gone
he
asked
carelessly
he
raised
hell
replied
mcfluke
but
lanpher
was
with
him
yuh
know
old
dale
hates
lanpher
like
poison
well
i
told
jack
like
i
tell
you
that
if
anything
slips
up
account
o
this
peaches
austin
can
take
the
blame
racey
nodded
indifferently
and
slouched
sidewise
so
that
he
could
watch
the
doorway
without
dislocating
his
neck
mcfluke
his
back
turned
still
stood
in
the
doorway
racey
lowered
a
cautious
hand
and
loosened
his
sixshooter
in
its
holster
he
wished
that
he
had
taken
the
precaution
to
tie
it
down
it
was
impossible
to
foresee
what
the
next
few
minutes
might
bring
forth
certainly
the
coming
of
peaches
austin
was
most
inopportune
peaches
austin
galloped
up
he
dismounted
he
tied
his
horse
he
greeted
cheerily
the
glowering
mcfluke
the
latter
did
not
reply
in
kind
this
is
a
fine
time
for
you
to
get
here
he
growled
a
time
shut
up
you
fool
cautioned
peaches
in
a
low
voice
ai
you
got
no
better
sense
with
the
old
man
do
let
the
old
man
worry
you
yapped
mcfluke
the
old
man
has
done
flitted
and
jack
been
here
and
done
flitted
whose
hoss
is
that
demanded
peaches
evidently
referring
to
mount
one
of
the
boys
replied
mcfluke
one
o
jack
friends
in
entered
then
peaches
austin
a
lithe
muscular
person
with
pale
eyes
and
a
face
the
colour
of
a
dead
fish
belly
he
stared
at
racey
dawson
it
was
evident
that
peaches
austin
was
taking
no
one
on
trust
he
nodded
briefly
to
racey
and
strode
to
the
bar
mcfluke
went
behind
the
bar
ai
i
seen
you
in
farewell
stranger
peaches
austin
asked
shortly
you
might
have
returned
racey
i
mighty
careless
where
i
travel
known
jack
long
peaches
was
becoming
nothing
if
not
personal
long
enough
smiled
racey
lookit
here
who
are
you
that
what
worryin
mcfluke
dodged
racey
wishing
that
he
could
see
just
what
it
was
mcfluke
was
doing
with
his
hands
but
mcfluke
was
employing
his
hands
in
nothing
more
dangerous
than
the
fetching
of
a
bottle
from
some
recess
under
and
behind
the
bar
now
he
laughed
he
ai
tellin
all
he
knows
he
said
to
peaches
austin
do
be
so
damn
suspiciony
peaches
he
a
friend
of
jack
i
tell
you
he
knows
all
about
the
deal
that
do
make
him
no
friend
of
jack
declared
peaches
stubbornly
i
at
which
juncture
peaches
flow
of
language
was
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
chuck
morgan
chuck
after
a
sweeping
glance
round
the
room
headed
straight
for
the
bar
mcfluke
said
chuck
halting
a
yard
from
the
bar
did
you
sell
any
redeye
to
old
man
dale
what
that
to
you
demanded
mcfluke
truculently
why
this
replied
chuck
producing
a
sixshooter
so
swiftly
that
mcfluke
blinked
you
listen
to
me
he
resumed
harshly
it
matter
whether
you
sold
it
to
him
or
not
he
it
here
and
the
main
thing
i
telling
you
if
he
gets
any
more
i
gon
na
make
you
hard
to
find
is
that
a
threat
or
a
promise
inquired
mcfluke
do
do
that
racey
said
suddenly
as
his
hand
shot
out
and
pinned
fast
the
right
wrist
of
peaches
austin
outside
now
where
we
can
talk
right
through
the
door
to
yore
left
aw
right
now
they
ca
hear
us
lookit
they
ai
any
call
for
a
gunplay
none
whatever
this
gent
is
only
laying
down
the
law
to
mac
and
here
you
have
to
get
serious
right
away
see
how
easy
mac
takes
it
he
doing
a
thing
not
a
thing
good
as
gold
mac
is
ca
you
see
how
a
killing
thisaway
and
a
fellah
like
morgan
too
would
maybe
put
a
crimp
in
this
place
for
good
have
some
sense
man
we
need
mcfluke
he
had
oughta
drawed
on
mac
said
peaches
his
pale
eyes
shifty
as
a
cat
darting
incessantly
between
racey
and
the
doorway
he
did
shoot
him
and
he
ai
you
lem
me
attend
to
this
will
you
i
get
him
away
quiet
and
peaceable
if
i
can
but
you
keep
out
of
it
peaches
austin
gnawed
his
lower
lip
i
never
did
like
chuck
morgan
he
grumbled
it
was
a
good
chance
a
good
chance
to
get
yoreself
lynched
shore
it
was
all
that
say
i
like
to
know
where
you
come
in
stranger
jack
never
said
anything
to
me
about
any
feller
yore
size
jack
is
like
me
he
ai
tellin
all
he
knows
and
while
talking
about
jack
i
tell
you
something
and
that
to
keep
away
from
farewell
for
days
why
for
so
to
give
jack
a
chance
to
cool
off
he
hotter
than
a
wet
wolf
you
did
turn
up
here
on
time
i
ai
afraid
of
jack
you
ai
but
you
know
how
jack
is
even
if
it
do
come
to
a
showdown
there
be
words
passed
and
i
do
wan
na
run
any
risk
of
you
quitting
the
outfit
every
man
is
needed
you
be
sensible
and
stick
here
with
mcfluke
days
like
i
say
and
after
that
in
to
farewell
in
the
meantime
i
see
jack
and
tell
him
how
it
happened
you
did
get
here
on
time
and
how
did
it
happen
anyway
peaches
austin
looked
this
way
and
that
before
replying
i
shore
do
like
to
tell
how
it
happened
he
said
sounds
so
babyish
like
but
my
hat
blowed
off
over
this
side
of
injun
ridge
a
ways
and
when
i
leaned
down
to
pick
her
up
my
hoss
started
my
hand
slipped
and
i
went
off
on
my
head
kerblam
and
do
you
know
i
bet
i
was
three
hours
from
hell
to
breakfast
before
i
caught
that
hoss
where
he
was
feedin
in
a
narrow
draw
i
all
tired
out
yet
they
ai
no
strength
in
my
legs
i
fix
it
up
with
jack
racey
lied
with
a
wonderfully
straight
face
do
you
worry
i
ai
worryin
peaches
denied
irritably
i
ai
afraid
of
jack
i
tell
you
shore
soothed
racey
who
having
formed
an
estimate
of
peaches
ranked
him
scarcely
higher
than
mcfluke
and
treated
him
accordingly
shore
i
know
you
ai
but
alla
same
you
need
considerable
of
a
coolin
off
yoreself
just
you
stay
out
here
now
and
watch
me
get
morgan
away
racey
nodded
blithely
to
peaches
austin
and
turned
to
go
into
the
house
he
saw
that
chuck
morgan
had
come
outside
that
he
had
brought
mcfluke
with
him
and
was
observing
events
with
a
cold
and
calculating
eye
i
tell
you
i
could
help
his
getting
the
whiskey
mcfluke
was
whining
it
ai
my
fault
if
somebody
gives
it
to
him
is
it
of
course
not
chimed
in
racey
briskly
mac
means
all
right
he
did
know
there
was
any
law
against
providing
old
dale
with
whiskey
they
is
a
law
insisted
chuck
morgan
belligerently
his
gun
trained
unswervingly
on
mcfluke
broad
stomach
they
is
a
law
i
made
it
and
it
goes
peaches
he
added
raising
his
voice
do
you
slide
round
the
house
now
if
you
move
so
much
as
a
yard
from
where
standing
i
ventilate
mcfluke
immediate
i
would
do
that
said
racey
mildly
i
got
my
eye
on
you
too
declared
chuck
what
i
said
to
peaches
goes
for
you
and
do
you
forget
it
i
ai
likely
to
not
me
all
i
want
you
to
do
is
go
else
peaceful
you
ai
figuring
on
living
here
are
you
chuck
uttered
a
short
hard
laugh
mcfluke
back
was
toward
racey
peaches
austin
was
behind
him
thirty
feet
away
racey
left
eyelid
drooped
his
head
moved
almost
imperceptibly
toward
his
horse
i
going
now
said
chuck
i
go
with
you
just
to
see
you
on
yore
way
sort
of
said
racey
you
was
going
with
me
anyway
sort
of
chuck
told
him
yo
the
only
round
here
so
far
i
can
see
and
i
ai
taking
any
chances
on
you
not
a
chance
yo
going
down
the
trail
a
spell
with
me
later
you
can
come
back
keep
yore
hands
where
they
are
quickly
chuck
shoved
mcfluke
to
one
side
rushed
forward
and
possessed
himself
of
racey
gun
crawl
yore
hoss
he
commanded
racey
obeyed
without
a
word
chuck
climbed
into
his
own
saddle
without
losing
the
magic
of
the
drop
and
without
losing
sight
for
an
instant
of
mcfluke
and
peaches
austin
take
the
trail
south
said
chuck
morgan
and
backed
his
horse
in
a
wide
racey
did
as
he
was
ordered
three
minutes
later
he
was
joined
by
his
friend
until
the
trail
took
them
down
into
a
draw
grown
up
in
spruce
chuck
gun
remained
very
much
in
evidence
any
unbiased
spectator
without
a
knowledge
of
the
facts
would
have
said
that
he
was
keeping
a
close
watch
on
racey
dawson
once
out
of
sight
of
the
house
of
mcfluke
chuck
sheathed
his
sixshooter
with
a
jerk
and
returned
racey
gun
you
did
fine
at
the
last
racey
said
admiringly
as
he
bolstered
his
weapon
but
what
did
you
jump
mcfluke
for
thataway
at
first
that
come
almighty
near
kicking
the
kettle
over
that
play
did
i
know
said
chuck
shamefacedly
and
when
i
rode
up
to
the
shack
i
had
intended
anything
like
that
but
when
i
saw
that
slickery
juniper
mcfluke
standing
there
behind
the
bar
so
fat
and
sassy
it
come
over
me
all
of
a
sudden
what
he
done
to
the
dale
family
by
letting
old
dale
have
whiskey
that
i
could
help
myself
gawd
i
wanted
to
knock
him
down
and
tromp
his
face
flat
as
a
floor
it
as
if
mcfluke
ai
been
told
about
old
dale
failing
i
warned
him
when
he
first
came
here
last
year
not
to
let
old
dale
have
redeye
on
any
account
i
know
nodded
racey
soberly
but
you
want
to
remember
his
giving
old
dale
whiskey
ai
the
particular
cow
we
after
there
more
to
it
than
that
a
whole
lot
more
we
got
to
be
a
careful
chuck
and
go
a
slow
if
we
go
having
a
fraycas
now
they
get
suspicious
and
go
fussbudgettin
round
like
a
after
quail
just
as
if
they
wo
suspicion
something
up
soon
as
peaches
austin
gets
back
to
farewell
peaches
austin
ai
going
back
to
farewell
right
away
i
fixed
peaches
for
a
few
days
and
a
few
days
is
all
i
need
to
find
out
what
i
want
to
and
even
after
peaches
does
float
in
will
he
know
me
after
i
changed
my
shirt
dirtied
my
hat
and
got
me
a
clean
shave
twice
over
he
ai
got
no
idea
what
i
look
like
under
the
whiskers
he
was
living
in
farewell
before
i
went
north
so
all
he
knows
about
me
is
my
voice
and
my
hoss
it
will
shore
be
the
worst
kind
of
luck
if
i
ca

peaches
from
hearing
the

other
until

i
ready

a
peevish
voice
in

street

racey
in
a
tone
of
vast
surprise

like
the
owner
of
the
starlight
hazarded
swing
tunstall
it

the
owner
of
the
starlight
corroborated
the
voice
and
i
wan
na
sleep
and
i
wan
na

we
ai
got
any
objections
racey
told
him

a
fine
free
country
and
every
gent

entitled
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness

things

regular
folks

good
boy
now
and

swing
cried
racey
struck
by
a
brilliant
idea
what
you
doing
with
that
gun
i
began
the
bewildered
swing
who
had
not
even
thought
of
his
gun
but
was
peacefully
sitting
on
his
cot
pulling
off
his
boots
leave
it
alone
racey
interrupted
in
a
hearty
bawl
do
you
go
holding
it
at
the
wall
even
in
fun
it
might
go
off
you
ca
tell
you
so
careless
with
a
sixshooter
swing
like
enough
you
aiming
right
where
the
feller
bed
is
too
he
added
craftily
ensued
then
sounds
of
rapid
departure
from
the
bed
next
door
a
door
flew
open
and
slammed
the
parting
guest
padded
down
the
stairs
in
his
socks
invoking
his
maker
as
he
went
and
that
the
last
of
him
chuckled
racey
oh
you
need
think
i
forgetting
grumbled
swing
tunstall
sliding
out
of
his
trousers
and
folding
them
tidily
beside
his
boots
you
yap
have
you
got
ta
let
a
woman
spoil
everything
spoil
everything
you
do
think
i
going
alla

to

by
myself
nobody
to
talk
to
nor
nothing
do
you
well
i
ai
you
can
stick
a
pin
in
that
racey
immediately
sprang
up
seized
his
friend
limp
hand
and
pumped
it
vigorously
bless
you
for
them
kind
words
he
said
i
knew

me
i
knew
i
could
depend
on
old
swing
to
do
the
right
thing
you
and
i
will
traipse
out
and
locate
us
a
couple
of
jobs
swing
doubled
a
leg
flattened
one
bare
foot
against
racey
chest
straightened
the
leg
and
deposited
racey
upon
his
own
proper
cot
with
force
and
precision
do
you
come
round
me
warned
swing
and
i
say
anything
about
sticking
by
you
neither
and
when
it
comes
to
the
right
thing
you
and
me
do
think
alike
i
i
wish
you
pull
yore
kicks
a
few
interrupted
racey
rubbing
his
chest
you
like
to
busted
a
rib
not
the
way
you
landed
countered
the
unfeeling
swing
tryin
to
get
off
the
trail
again
here
you
and
me
plan
her
all
out
to
go
to
you
bet
burst
in
racey
enthusiastically
we
planned
to
go
to
either
the
bar
s
or
the
and
get
that
job
shore
we
did
you
got
a
memory
like
all
outdoors
swing
it
plumb
amazes
me
how
clear
and
straight
you
keep
everything
in
that
head
of
yores
yep
it
shore
does
hereupon
in
the
most
unconcerned
manner
racey
dawson
began
to
blow
smoke
rings
toward
the
ceiling
swing
tunstall
sank
sulkily
down
upon
an
elbow
whatsa
use
said
swing
tunstall
whatsa
use
it
was
then
that
someone
knocked
upon
their
chamber
door
come
in
said
racey
dawson
the
door
opened
and
lanpher
comrade
of
the
attractive
smile
and
the
ruthless
profile
walked
into
the
room
he
closed
the
door
without
noise
spread
his
legs
and
looked
upon
the
two
friends
silently
i
heard
you
talking
through
the
wall
he
said
in
a
studiedly
low
tone
a
tone
that
heard
through
a
partition
would
have
been
but
an
indistinguishable
murmur
hearing
us
talk
through
walls
seems
to
be
a
habit
in
this
hotel
commented
racey
tactfully
following
the
other
lead
in
lowness
of
tone
i
could
help
hearing
apologized
the
stranger
he
was
vestless
and
bootless
evidently
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
retiring
when
the
spirit
moved
him
to
visit
his
i
like
to
talk
to
you
you
welcome
said
racey
hospitably
yanking
his
trousers
from
the
only
chair
the
room
possessed
sit
down
the
stranger
sat
racey
dawson
sitting
on
the
bed
his
knees
on
a
level
with
his
chin
clasped
his
hands
round
his
bare
ankles
and
accorded
the
stranger
his
closest
attention
to
the
casual
observer
however
racey
looked
uncommonly
dull
and
sleepy
even
stupid
but
not
too
stupid
racey
possessed
too
much
native
finesse
to
overdo
it
it
was
apparent
that
the
stranger
did
not
recognize
him
which
was
not
surprising
for
at
the
dale
ranch
racey
had
been
wearing
all
his
clothes
and
a
beard
of
weeks
now
he
was
and
attired
in
nothing
but
a
flannel
shirt
true
the
stranger
must
have
heard
him
singing
to
miss
dale
but
a
singing
voice
is
far
different
from
a
speaking
voice
and
racey
had
not
uttered
a
single
conversational
word
in
the
stranger
presence
now
he
had
occasion
to
bless
this
happy
chance
swing
tunstall
slow
to
take
a
cue
and
still
suffering
with
the
sulks
continued
to
lie
quietly
his
head
supported
on
a
bent
arm
and
smoke
but
he
watched
the
stranger
narrowly
the
stranger
tilted
back
his
chair
and
levering
with
his
toes
teetered
to
and
fro
in
silence
i
heard
you
say
you
were
looking
for
a
job
in
the
morning
the
stranger
said
suddenly
to
racey
you
heard
right
nodded
racey
are
you
dead
set
on
working
for
the
bar
s
or
the
i
ai
dead
set
on
working
for
anybody
work
ai
a
habit
with
either
of
us
but
so
long
as
we
got
to
work
the
ranches
with
good
cooks
have
the
call
and
the
bar
s
and
richie
outfit
have
special
good
cooks
the
stranger
nodded
and
began
to
smooth
down
hand
over
hand
his
tousled
hair
it
was
very
thick
hair
oily
and
coarse
when
sufficiently
smoothed
it
presented
that
shiny
slick
appearance
so
much
admired
in
the
black
walnut
era
not
till
each
and
every
lock
lay
in
perfect
adjustment
with
its
neighbour
did
the
stranger
speak
cooks
mean
a
whole
lot
was
his
opening
remark
a
good
one
can
come
mighty
nigh
holding
a
outfit
together
money
ai
to
be
sneezed
at
neither
good
wages
paid
on
the
nail
run
the
cook
a
close
second
how
would
you
boys
like
to
work
for
me
the
stranger
as
he
asked
the
question
fixed
racey
with
his
black
eyes
the
puncher
felt
as
if
a
steel
drill
were
boring
into
his
brain
but
he
returned
the
stare
without
appreciable
effort
racey
dawson
was
not
of
those
that
lower
their
eyes
to
any
man
i
take
it
drawled
racey
that
you
fixing
to
install
all
the
comforts
of
home
you
were
just
now
talking
about
a
good
cook
and
better
wages
for
the
honest
naturally
i
am
the
stranger
eyes
shifted
to
swing
face
yeah
naturally
thus
racey
dawson
the
stranger
eyes
returned
quickly
to
racey
there
had
been
a
barely
perceptible
pause
between
the
two
words
uttered
by
racey
dawson
pauses
signify
a
great
deal
at
times
this
might
be
one
of
those
times
and
it
might
not
the
stranger
could
be
sure
from
that
moment
the
stranger
watched
racey
dawson
even
as
the
proverbial
cat
watches
the
mouse
hole
racey
knew
that
the
stranger
was
watching
him
and
he
knew
why
so
he
smiled
with
bland
stupidity
and
nodded
a
foolish
head
what
wages
he
inquired
fifty
per
was
the
reply
where
southeast
of
dogville
the
rafter
h
ranch
the
rafter
h
huh
i
thought
that
was
haley
outfit
i
expect
to
buy
out
haley
explained
the
stranger
smoothly
my
name
harpe
jack
harpe
what
may
i
call
you
gents
dawson
tunstall
eh
i
haley
ai
much
better
than
a
nester
interrupted
racey
he
own
more
forty
cows
what
you
want
with
two
punchers
for
a
small
bunch
like
that
and
at
fifty
per
i
know
she
ai
much
of
a
ranch
now
admitted
jack
harpe
but
everything
has
to
have
a
beginning
i
figuring
on
a
right
smart
growth
for
the
rafter
h
within
the
next
year
or
two
figuring
on
opposition
maybe
probed
racey
dawson
you
never
can
tell
you
can
if
you
go
to
cutting
any
of
baldy
barbee
corners
little
bunch
never
bothers
baldy
none
but
a
outfit
so
close
to
the
south
thataway
would
shore
give
him
something
to
think
about
then
there
the
anvil
ranch
east
of
the
b
bar
b
they
begin
to
scratch
their
heads
you
bet
hall
too
maybe
although
he
is
a
good
ways
to
the
east
she
all
free
range
said
jack
harpe
i
guess
i
got
as
good
a
right
here
as
the
next
gent
providing
you
can
make
the
next
gent
see
yore
side
of
the
case
suggested
racey
most
folks
are
willing
to
listen
to
reason
stated
jack
harpe
i
ai
so
shore
doubted
racey
you
ai
looked
at
the
whole
of
the
layout
yet
how
about
the
ranch
repeated
jack
harpe
in
a
tone
of
surprise
what
i
have
to
do
with
the
i
like
to
know
i
dunno
said
racey
his
eyes
more
stupid
than
ever
i
was
just
jack
harpe
laughed
without
a
sound
it
seemed
to
be
a
habit
of
his
to
laugh
silently
you
saw
me
with
lanpher
did
you
well
lanpher
and
i
are
just
friends
thassall
my
cattle
wo
graze
far
enough
south
to
overlap
on
the
anywheres
nor
the
bar
s
suggested
racey
nor
the
bar
that
sensible
thus
racey
watching
closely
jack
harpe
from
under
lowered
lids
did
his
last
remark
strike
a
glint
from
the
other
man
eyes
he
thought
it
did
certainly
jack
harpe
eyes
had
narrowed
suddenly
and
slightly
yeah
jack
harpe
said
i
ai
counting
on
having
any
fussing
with
either
the
or
the
bar
of
course
baldy
barbee
and
the
anvil
are
different
dunno
how
they
take
it
dunno
that
i
care
much
which
is
why
you
payin
fifty
per
jack
harpe
nodded
yep
got
ta
be
prepared
for
them
fellers
baldy
barbee
and
the
anvil
outfit
you
right
assented
racey
dawson
must
let
catch
you
napping
you
would
look
foolish
then
would
you
he
broke
off
with
a
sounding
laugh
and
slapped
a
silly
leg
how
about
it
gents
inquired
jack
harpe
are
you
riding
for
me
or
not
you
wanting
to
know
right
now
this
minute
i
do
have
to
know
right
now
because
i
wo
be
ready
for
you
to
begin
for
two
or
three
weeks
but
knowing
would
help
my
plans
a
few
i
got
ta
figure
things
out
ahead
shore
shore
let
you
know
day
after
or
sooner
maybe
how
that
good
enough
remember
yore
wages
start
the
day
you
say
when
even
if
you
do
begin
work
for
a
month
yet
all
i
ask
is
for
you
to
stay
round
town
where
i
can
get
hold
of
you
easy
with
this
the
stranger
slid
from
the
chair
opened
the
door
part
way
and
oozed
into
the
hall
he
closed
the
door
without
a
sound
he
regained
his
own
room
in
equal
silence
racey
did
not
hear
the
shutting
of
the
other
door
but
he
heard
the
springs
of
the
cot
squeak
under
jack
harpe
weight
as
he
lay
down
swing
tunstall
framed
a
remark
with
his
lips
only
racey
dawson
shook
his
head
the
partition
was
too
thin
and
jack
harpe
ears
were
too
long
and
sharp
for
him
to
risk
even
the
tiniest
of
whispers
with
his
hand
he
made
the
indian
sign
for
stretched
out
his
long
legs
yawned
and
fell
almost
instantly
asleep
chapter
vii
the
riddle
we
oughta
closed
with
jack
harpe
last
night
said
swing
tunstall
easing
his
muscular
body
down
on
a
broken
that
sat
drunkenly
beside
the
posts
of
the
hotel
corral
what
the
sense
of
putting
things
off
thataway
racey
now
we
lose
two
days
wages
for
nothing
i
had
a
reason
declared
racey
dawson
threading
a
new
rawhide
string
through
one
of
the
silver
conchas
on
his
bridle
i
wanted
to
talk
it
over
good
with
you
first
why
for
what
there
to
talk
over
i
like
to
know
why
because
interrupted
racey
there
something
up
if
you
ask
me
what
for
a
reason
is
that
demanded
the
irritated
swing
that
a
reason
no
good
reason
anyway
i
telling
you
flat
y
understand
that
so
long
as
we
got
ta
take
root
here
instead
of
going
to
arizona
like
we
planned
it
out
so
long
yo
gon
na
renig
on
the
play
like
i
say
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
string
our
chips
with
jack
harpe
that
yore
idea
of
a
bright
thing
to
do
huh
questioned
racey
his
nimble
fingers
busy
with
the
rawhide
i
done
told
you
said
swing
with
dignity
poor
poor
swing
murmured
racey
as
though
to
the
bridle
address
the
young
feller
it
must
be
the
devil
and
all
to
go
through
life
in
such
shape
as
he
in
all
right
in
lots
of
ways
too
he
eats
like
a
hawg
drinks
like
a
fish
and
snores
like
a
ripsaw
so
you
can
see
there
something
almost
human
about
him
but
he
any
brains
not
a
brain
he
never
has
anything
on
his
mind
but
his
hair
and
a
hat
yep
she

sad
sad
case

feel
sorry
for

to
the
latch
and
slam

aching
a
long
long
while

thisaway
swing
racey
said
soberly
there

any
manner
of
use

into
something

the
whole
straight
of

i
bet
you
think
it
was
a
fairy
tale
i
might

the
sceptical
swing
but

a
pole
like
tom
kane
thataway
always
wantin
in
where
it
warm
aw
right
that
settled
lookit
we
know
there
some
crooked
work
on
the
towpath
going
on
and
that
lanpher
and
harpe
are
in
it
up
to
their
hocks
we
know
that
nebraska
is
one
of
harpe
friends
and
we
know
that
my
fuss
with
nebraska
harpe
comes
to
you
and
me
and
offers
us
jobs
jobs
at
fifty
per
wages
to
start
when
we
say
when
and
no
work
for
a
while
yet
we
to
stay
round
town
till
he
wants
us
to
start
in
and
he
talks
of
maybe
a
trouble
in
the
future
with
baldy
barbee
and
the
anvil
boys
and
he
mentions
baldy
and
the
anvil
several
times
and
the
last
time
was
necessary
and
furthermore
he
do
say
anything
about
this
chin
whisker
gent
who
old
dale
or
i
dutch
so
there
and
plain
enough
added
racey
holding
up
the
bridle
and
turning
it
about
from
what
harpe
said
to
lanpher
we
know
he
bound
to
get
old
dale
ranch
come
hell
or
high
water
but
he
do
say
anything
about
that
to
us
no
not
him
all
barbee
and
the
anvil
and
he
as
friendly
as
a
dog
with
fleas
his
actions
do
fit
with
the
facts
and
when
a
man
actions
do
that
they
stand
watchin
him
and
them
both
fifty
per
ai
to
be
sneezed
at
swing
whose
heart
had
been
set
on
arizona
was
not
prepared
to
give
in
without
an
argument
besides
he
invariably
objected
on
principle
to
anything
racey
might
see
fit
to
propose
which
was
humanly
natural
but
more
than
maddening
to
racey
shore
not
unless
it
sets
us
against
our
friends
what
you
talkin
about
persisted
the
wilfully
blinded
swing
neither
baldy
barbee
nor
the
anvil
outfit
are
any
friends
of
mine
i
do
even
know
to
speak
to
but
i
tell
you
it
ai
baldy
barbee
and
the
anvil
you
floop
if
it
was
them
why
would
lanpher
be
in
it
and
nebraska
and
thompson
and
peaches
austin
i
dunno
exactly
what
it
all
means
but
whatever
it
is
it
got
ta
do
with
the
country
round
farewell
with
the
ranches
on
the
lazy
aw
right
besides
dale
and
morgan
three
ranches
ai
they
on
the
lazy
near
farewell
racey
dawson
held
up
three
fingers
doubling
a
thumb
and
forefinger
behind
them
three
ranches
he
continued
and
the
manager
of
one
is
in
cahoots
with
this
harpe
of
many
strings
here
he
doubled
down
his
pinky
and
waved
the
remaining
two
fingers
in
the
face
of
his
friend
two
ranches
are
left
the
and
the
bar
jack
richie
is
manager
of
the
i
used
to
ride
for
jack
and
he
my
friend
you
dunno
him
but
you
can
take
my
word
he
the
pure
quill
forty
ways
then
there
the
bar
who
foreman
of
that
tom
loudon
you
worked
with
him
up
at
scotty
mackenzie
flyin
m
ranch
on
the
dogsoldier
and
i
knowed
him
ever
since
i
come
to
this
country
i
ai
doing
anything
to
make
me
bad
friends
with
tom
loudon
then
there
dale
this
chin
whisker
party
he
a
good
feller
and
had
a
heap
of
hard
luck
too
i
ai
working
against
him
you
betcha
nawsir
and
if
i
do
miss
my
guess
you
do
either
aw
hell
they
ai
no
rat
in
that
hole
yo
seem
a
heap
o
smoke
where
they
ai
even
a
lighted
match
i
do
wan
na
do
anything
against
either
richie
outfit
nor
the
bar
s
nor
old
dale
but
i
ai
satisfied
you
ai
good
gawdamighty
ai
i
been
tellin
you
ai
i
been
explaining
of
it
all
in
words
of
one
syllable
ca
you
see
trying
to
pull
us
in
with
him
is
just
a
trick
to
get
us
shot
by
our
friends
because
his
jumping
old
dale
ranch
will
shore
start
a
war
and
you
can
gamble
it
just
as
dangerous
to
be
shot
by
yore
friends
as
it
is
by
the
enemy
here
i
telling
you
over
and
over
and
you
ai
satisfied
yet
i
heard
of
fellers
like
you
but
i
never
believed
it
was
possible
like
the
they
were
just
a
damn
lie
but
it
all
true
swing
old
settler
if
you
had
a
more
sense
you
be
if
i
had
a
more
sense
i
quit
you
cold
like
that
so
saying
swing
tunstall
rose
to
his
feet
and
shuffled
a
guileful
step
or
two
closer
to
racey
the
movement
of
his
right
arm
passed
unnoticed
by
racey
but
the
lighted
cigarette
that
following
his
movement
slipped
down
racey
back
between
his
shirt
collar
and
his
neck
did
not
pass
unnoticed
racey
hopped
up
with
a
sharp
exclamation
and
shucked
himself
out
of
his
shirt
with
the
utmost
despatch
he
did
not
stop
at
the
shirt
but
tore
off
his
undershirt
likewise
better
luck
than
i
hoped
for
swing
remarked
from
a
safe
distance
i
did
think
it
would
slide
down
inside
yore
undershirt
too
burn
you
much
racey
dear
you
look
awful
cute
standin
there
with
nothing
on
but
yore
pants
all
you
need
now
is
a
pair
of
wings
and
a
bow
and
you
be
a
dead
ringer
for
cupid
growed
up
and
mis
lainey
and
mis
galloway
looking
at
you
from
their
kitchen
windows
they
can
hear
what
yo
saying
too
fie
for
shame
but
racey
dawson
had
gathered
up
his
clothing
and
fled
to
the
back
of
the
corral
muttering
to
himself
he
was
pulling
on
his
shirt
when
swing
joined
him
at
a
safe
distance
helluva
trick
to
play
on
a
feller
grumbled
racey
served
you
right
was
the
return
you
had
oughta
called
me

just
like
a
turtle
in

shell
with
yore
shirt
half
on
half
off

this
juncture

a
bath

a
day
once
on

well

place
rack
slimson
my
most
payin
customer

sleep
on
the
dinin
room
table
all
night
because
you
druv
him
out
of
his
room
bill
that
was
a
joke
racey
intoned
solemnly
i
did
like
the
way
the
feller
snored
likewise
he
had
too
much
to
say
so
naturally
i
had
to
make
him
take
it
on
the
run
what
else
could
i
do
i
ask
you
what
else
could
i
do
do
you
believe
him
bill
cut
in
swing
fearful
that
racey
would
get
credit
for
an
effort
at
humour
where
in
his
own
estimation
none
was
due
racey
has
got
the
guts
to
pick
a
fuss
with
a
pack
rat
it
was
me
that
chased
rack
slimson
downstairs
that
right
racey
assented
smoothly
suddenly
mindful
both
of
a
peculiar
gleam
in
bill
lainey
eye
and
a
chance
sentence
uttered
by
the
hasher
in
his
hearing
at
breakfast
that
right
it
was
swing
tunstall
what
made
so
free
and
outrageous
with
rack
slimson
you
go
and
crawl
swing
hump
bill
lord

busted
when

only
bein

out
thataway
he

it
like
huh
how

inquired
swing
in
a
still
small
voice
and
thrust
his
hand
within
his
pocket
well
seein
as
it
you
swing
was
the
prompt
reply
i
only
say
ten
dollars
and
six
bits
and
that
dirt
cheap
honest
i
bet
it
cost
me
fifteen
dollars
and
a
half
to
replace
what
with
the
scandalous
prices
we
got
now
and
i
hope
that
make
you
a
better
boy
swing
said
racey
observing
with
relish
the
transfer
of
real
money
from
swing
hand
to
the
landlord
palm
there
such
a
thing
swing
old
settler
as
being
too
quick
as
whirling
too
wide
a
loop
as
the
man
said
when
he
roped
the
locomotive
and
it
all
costs
money
yep
sometimes
as
much
as
ten
dollars
and
six
bits
and
one
and
one
and
two
makes
ten
and
six
bits
makes
totalled
swing
tunstall
and
that
makes
all
square
correct
said
bill
lainey
stuffing
the
money
into
a
wide
trousers
pocket
to
you
swing
i
wish
all
the
gents
paid
up
as
prompt
as
you
do
oh

surprised

in
the
ready
racey
swing

him
where
he
wrong
yeah

many
friends

this
town
more
than

was
the
enigmatic
reply

for
what
for
whatever
necessary
racey
but
i
ai
talking
about
nebraska
and
his
friends
not
me
i
got
a
wife
and

trouble
running
a
hotel
without
picking
up
any
more
by
letting
yore
tongue
waggle
too
much
yo
right
bill
yore
views
do
you
credit
is
it
against
the
law
to
tell
a
feller
where
nebraska
friends
hang
out
when
they
in
town
the
dance
hall
and
the
starlight
replied
bill
lainey
promptly

you
happen
to
know
any
of
their
names

what
you
wan
na

racey
is

for
a
jigger
named

the
point
doc
coffin
yop
then

thompson
honey
hoke
and
peaches
austin
they
a
few
more
but
they
ai
the
kind
to
take
the
lead
in
anything
they
always
follow
but
coffin
thompson
hoke
and
austin
are
the
gents
to
keep
yore
eye
peeled
for
i
ai
talking
about
y
understand
i
ai
got
a
word
to
say

and
i
wanted
to
live
longer
and
healthier
doc
coffin

the
one

hastily
i

i
wo
is
the
starlight
owner
rack
slimson
any
friend
of
nebraska
too
i
dunno
as
he
a
boom
companion
exactly
but
nebraska
and
his
bunch
spend
a
pile
of
money
in
the
starlight
a
pile
of
money
a
feller
would
be
safe
in
saying
that
rack
slimson
sympathy
is
with
nebraska
chapter
viii
the
starlight
where
you
going
demanded
swing
tunstall
over
the
hills
and
far
away
to
pick
the
wild
violets
chanted
racey
you
wan
na
come
along
better
not
them
violets
are
just
too
awful
wild
dangerous
yeah
catch
yore
death
you
idjit
you
plumb
fool
ca
you
let
well
enough
alone
ai
you
satisfied
till
yo
ticklin
the
mule
hind
leg
if
yo
crowded
hop
to
it
make
hard
to
find
but
why
go
trouble
whatsa
sense
what
always
get
the
jump
on
trouble
swing
always
then
you
find
trouble
do
wear
so
many
guns
after
all
and
is
a
heap
slower
about
pulling
than
you
thought
likely
but
if
they
all
four
of
together
now
and
you
i
ai
said
i
was
going
to
do
anything
have
i
swing
i
only
want
to
go
and
ask
how
nebraska
gettin
along
only
tryin
to
be
neighbourly
yeah
neighbourly
racey
dawson
nodded
his
head
as
one
does
when
a
subject
is
closed
hitched
up
his
chaps
and
started
blithely
round
the
hotel
swing
tunstall
followed
in
haste
caught
up
with
his
friend
and
fell
into
step
at
his
side
this
ai
any
of
yore
muss
swing
racey
said
mildly
it
gon
na
be
was
the
determined
reply
you
shut
up
racey
grinned
at
nothing
and
stuck
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
a
warmly
pleasant
glow
permeated
his
being
it
was
good
to
have
a
friend
like
swing
tunstall
one
who
would
not
interfere
but
who
would
be
in
alert
readiness
for
any
contingency
and
racey
was
well
aware
that
in
his
impending
visit
to
the
starlight
the
contingencies
were
apt
to
be
many
and
varied
it
so
early
in
the
day
i
do
guess
none
of
will
be
in
the
dance
hall
yet
murmured
swing
tunstall
i
gon
na
drop
in
on
the
starlight
first
anyway
said
racey
nearer
through
a
side
window
they
inspected
the
starlight
and
the
customers
thereof
only
two
customers
were
visible
these
a
long
man
and
a
short
man
stood
at
the
bar
their
backs
to
the
window
and
their
hands
cupped
lovingly
round
glasses
of
refreshment
the
tall
man
was
talking
to
the
bartender
this
getting
up
so
early
in
the
mornin
is
a
fright
they
heard
him
complain
but
bunking
with
a
invalid
shore
does
keep
you
on
the
jump
he
and
his
companion
drank
racey
dawson
and
swing
tunstall
glided
rapidly
along
the
wall
to
a
side
entrance
when
the
tall
man
and
the
short
man
set
down
their
glasses
racey
dawson
was
leaning
against
the
bar
at
a
range
of
approximately
six
feet
swing
tunstall
stood
at
his
back
and
slightly
to
the
right
thus
that
should
necessity
warrant
a
resort
to
lethal
weapons
racey
might
not
mask
the
latter
fire
liquor
said
racey
to
the
bartender
the
latter
an
expert
at
his
trade
with
a
jerk
of
both
wrists
slid
two
glasses
and
a
bottle
down
the
bar
so
that
a
glass
stopped
in
front
of
each
man
and
the
bottle
came
to
a
standstill
between
them
racey
spun
a
dollar
on
the
bar
the
bartender
nonchalantly
swept
the
dollar
into
the
cash
drawer
and
resumed
his
with
the
tall
man
at
which
racey
eyes
narrowed
slightly
but
he
made
no
comment
pouring
out
a
short
drink
he
passed
the
bottle
to
his
comrade
when
swing
had
filled
racey
took
the
bottle
drove
home
the
cork
with
the
heel
of
his
hand
and
carefully
tucked
away
the
bottle
in
the
inner
pocket
of
his
vest
it
wo
ride
any
too
well
he
observed
to
swing
but
it
gon
na
be
there
a
great
while
i
guess
you
bet
it
ai
gon
na
be
there
a
great
while
horned
in
the
outraged
bartender
you
put
that
bottle
back
on
the
bar
why
i
gave
you
a
dollar
said
racey
nervously
hesitantly
and
you
kept
the
change
i
supposed
of
course
you
was
selling
me
the
bottle
you
supposed
wrong
as
he
spoke
the
bartender
right
hand
moved
toward
the
shelf
that
racey
knew
must
be
under
the
top
of
the
bar
that
dollar
was
for
yore
two
drinks
you
mean
to
say
yo
charging
four
bits
apiece
for
those
drinks
shore
i
am
as
yet
the
bartender
hand
had
remained
beneath
the
bar
top
but
two
bits
is
the
regular
price
objected
racey
weakly
four
bits
is
the
price
to
you
was
the
truculent
statement
sticking
out
his
chin
that
bottle
back
on
the
as
he
gave
the
order
his
right
shoulder
hunched
upward
and
his
face
set
like
iron
he
had
what
is
known
as
a
fighting
face
this
starlight
bartender
it
was
evident
that
he
banked
largely
on
that
face
it
had
served
him
well
in
the
past
one
dollar
is
my
regular
price
for
a
bottle
racey
said
gently
as
the
bartender
hand
suddenly
nipped
into
sight
clutching
a
sixshooter
but
if
you
want
it
back
take
it
racey
fingers
gripped
the
and
fetched
it
forth
but
instead
of
placing
it
on
the
top
of
the
bar
as
requested
he
continued
the
motion
as
it
were
and
smote
the
bartender
across
the
head
with
it
being
a
quart
bottle
and
reasonably
full
of
liquid
the
bartender
chin
came
down
with
a
chug
on
the
bar
then
he
slumped
quietly
to
the
floor
behind
the
bar
the
sixshooter
relinquished
by
his
nerveless
fingers
remained
on
top
of
the
bar
between
the
whiskey
glasses
racey
stared
speculatively
at
the
long
man
and
the
short
man
they
in
turn
regarded
him
with
something
like
respect
the
long
man
wore
a
drooping
horseshoe
of
a
moustache
dominated
by
a
long
and
melancholy
nose
flanking
the
base
of
this
sorrowful
nose
was
a
pair
of
eyes
hard
and
bright
and
the
palest
of
blue
the
short
man
was
a
creature
who
sported
a
three
growth
of
red
beard
and
a
quid
of
chewing
in
the
angle
of
a
heavy
jaw
now
he
revolved
the
tobacco
with
a
furtive
tongue
and
spat
thickly
upon
the
floor
without
removing
his
eyes
from
the
two
aforementioned
gentlemen
racey
reached
for
the
bartender
gun
had
oughta
be
trusted
with
firearms
he
observed
pleasantly
referring
to
what
lay
behind
the
bar
too
venturesome
yeah
he
thoughtfully
lowered
the
hammer
of
the
sixshooter
and
rammed
it
down
to
the
behind
the
waistband
of
his
trousers
do
you
gents
know
anybody
named
doc
coffin
inquired
racey
i
him
nodded
the
tall
man
the
pale
eyes
beginning
to
glitter
then
maybe
you
can
tell
me
how
nebraska
jones
is
gettin
along
you
worrying
about
his
health
put
in
the
short
man
i
dunno
as
i
say
exactly
disclaimed
racey
easily
you
can
take
it
i
just
askin
that
all
nebraska
had
oughta
be
as
well
as
ever
he
was
in
about
a
month
supplied
doc

added
significantly
i
dunno
but
what
he
oughta
be
able
to
shoot
as
well
as
ever
i
do
doubt
it
a
mite
said
racey
with
a
smile
question
is
will
he
the
short
man
gave
a
short
harsh
laugh
he
will
you
can
gamble
on
that
he
averred
and
spat
again
that
good
hearing
racey
said
looking
quite
pleased
of
course
i
was
only
judging
by
past
performances
his
gun
caught
doc
coffin
explained
kindly
why
do
he
try
filing
off
his
foresight
inquired
racey
chattily
or
else
he
could
shoot
through
his
holster
lots
of
folks
do
business
that
way
i
suppose
now
you
be
seeing
nebraska
in
a
day
or
two
maybe
i
might
admitted
doc
coffin
friend
of
his
purred
racey
i
might
be
doc

spare
frame
grew
somewhat
rigid
well
racey
drawled
softly
i

for
me
i
here
to
save
the
trouble
of
strainin
their
eyes

grinned
as
he
spoke
like
a
grieving
wolf
they
ai
no
hurry

i
expect

be
round
farewell
a
spell
said
racey
then
they
ai
no

told
him
smoothly

contributed
the
short
man
that
the
way
to
look
at
it
laughed
racey
i
shore
do
care
anything
about
bein
pushed
have
a
drink
on
me
he
slid
in
their
direction
the
bottle
with
which
he
had
knocked
down
the
bartender
and
accompanied
and
imitated
by
swing
tunstall
departed
from
that
place
crabwise
when
they
were
gone
doc
coffin
looked
at
his
companion
asking
for
it
honey
said
doc
coffin
just
asking
for
it
then
he
went
behind
the
bar
seized
the
senseless
bartender
by
the
ankles
and
skidded
him
out
on
the
barroom
floor
the
man
whom
doc
coffin
had
addressed
as
honey
his
other
name
was
hoke
spread
his
legs
and
whistled
when
he
glimpsed
the
cut
running
fore
and
aft
along
the
top
of
the
bartender
skull
blood
from
that
cut
had
dribbled
and
oozed
over
the
major
portion
of
the
bartender
face
and
shirt
for
it
had
been
the
bartender
luck
to
hook
his
chin
on
the
edge
of
the
lowest
shelf
when
he
dropped
and
he
had
perforce
remained
crown
upward
doc
coffin
stood
back
and
stared
at
the
stertorously
breathing
lump
on
the
floor
with
a
cold
eye
ai
he
a
mess
he
observed
ai
he
a
mess
i
expect
he
be
right
down
peevish
about
it
when

to
think

not
quite

over
across
from

doc

was
looking
out
of
the
grimy
window
behind

closed

giving
egress
to

back
room
certain
folk

busy
at

grimly
how

inquired

put
up
a
hand

the
bandage
encircling
his
bullet
head
and
swore
feelingly

consolingly
so
get
discouraged
they
did
not
find
jack
harpe
at
the
hotel
nor
was
he
at
the
happy
heart
but
in
the
saloon
luke
tweezy
was
drinking
by
himself
at
one
end
of
the
bar
perhaps
the
would
know
the
whereabouts
of
jack
harpe
luke
was
racey
greeting
seen
jack
harpe
around
anywheres
luke
tweezy
thin
and
sandy
eyebrows
lifted
up
in
what

almost
any

for

indifferently

kind
of
nose
jack

shore
you

why

off
abruptly
yeah
prompted
luke
tweezy
after
an
interval
you
seen
what
i
do
see
why
you
dunno
him
parried
racey
it
was
a
weak
parry
but
the
best
he
could
encompass
at
the
moment
i
thought
you
knowed
him
somebody
told
me
you
did
my
mistake
no
harm
done

a
drink
luke
who

luke
tweezy
when
he
had
smacked
his
lips
over
a
second
drink
i
do
remember
now
evaded
racey
dawson
what

afraid
to
fill
up
they
plenty
more
on
the
back
shelf
when

empty
they
filled
and

filled
and
drank
swing
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
racey
overtaken
by
liquor
so
quickly
in
no
time
he
was
telling
luke
tweezy
the
most
intimate
details
of
his
private
life
swing
knew
that
these
details
were
a
string
of
lies
but
luke
tweezy
could
not
know
that
he
put
an
affectionate
hand
on
racey
shoulder
and
begged
for
more
he
got
it
when
racey
ran
down
and
reverted
to
the
bottle
luke
tweezy
generously
purchased
a
second
and
invited
him
and
his
friend
to
a
vacant
table
in
the
corner
of
the
room
it
was
an
amazing
sight
luke
tweezy
the
the
man
who
was
supposed
to
still
possess
the
first
dollar
he
ever
earned
had
actually
bought
three
eighths
of
one
bottle
of
whiskey
and
the
whole
of
another
racey
dawson
greatly
desired
to
laugh
but
he
did
dare
he
was
too
busy
being
drunk
and
getting
drunker
swing
tunstall
slow
in
the
uptake
as
usual
perceived
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
luke
tweezy
had
suddenly
become
a
careless
spendthrift
till
halfway
down
the
second
bottle
when
luke
said
shore
is
funny
how
you
thought
i
knowed
this
jack
harpe
assented
racey
and
overset
a
glass
in
such
a
way
that
four
fingers
of
raw
liquor
splashed
into
luke
tweezy
lap
all
right
an
that
he
added
as
luke
and
his
chair
scraped
backward
to
avoid
the
drip
wet
yuh
all
up
i
makin
of
mistakes
luke
tweezy
twisted
his
leathery
features
into
his
best
smile

that
luke

eyed

sharply
as

once
racey
began
to
roll
his
head
from

rock
his

declared
solemnly
reaching
across
the
table
and
affectionately
pawing
the
tweezy
sleeve
i
but
i
know
a
friend
when
i
see
him
yuh
i
do
luke
lean
over
here
racey
pressed
heavily
on
swing
instep
then
when
luke
leaned
forward
racey
did
the
same
and
possessed
himself
of
the
ear
by
the
simple
method
of
gripping
it
tightly
between
fingers
and
thumb
resumed
racey
jack
harpe
offered
us
a
job
too
an
we
gon
na
take
him
up
instead
of
the
bar
that
racey
released
the
tweezy
ear
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
breathed
triumphantly
through
his
nose
luke
tweezy
likewise
leaned
back
as
far
as
his
chair
would
permit
and
fingered
tenderly
a
tingling
ear
whatcha
gon
na
take
harpe
job
for
he
asked
puzzled
i
thought
you
liked
the
bar
s
such
a
lot
we
do
chirped
racey
laying
a
long
finger
beside
his
nose
and
pressing
again
the
tunstall
instep
that
why
we
gon
na
ride
for
jack
harpe
grinning
at
the
mystification
of
luke
tweezy
he
leaned
forward
and
whispered
we
got
a
idea
we
can
help
the
bar
s
most
by
bein
where
we
can
watch
jack
and
his
outfit
luke
tweezy
sat
up
very
suddenly
swing
clapped
a
hand
over
mouth
and
shoved
him
backward
shut
up
commanded
swing
he
dunno
what
he
talkin
about
the
poor
drunk
thus
did
swing
tunstall
come
up
to
the
scratch
right
nobly
racey
could
have
hugged
him
instead
he
bit
him
this
in
order
that
swing
should
pull
his
hand
away
in
a
natural
manner
having
achieved
his
purpose
racey
smiled
sottishly
at
luke
tweezy
but
what
jack
harpe
done
luke
tweezy
inquired
swiftly
it
ai
what
he
done
racey
replied
it
what
he
gon
na
do
he
out
to
the
s
an
they
it
whereupon
swing
began
to
shake
him
severely
stop
yore
ravin
he
commanded
and
contrived
to
bang
racey
head
against
the
wall
with
a
bump
that
went
a
long
way
toward
curing
the
pain
of
racey
bite
racey
with
real
tears
in
his
eyes
looked
up
at
swing
and
guggled
i
sho
shleepy
then
he
laid
his
head
upon
his
arms
and
slept
luke
tweezy
did
not
attempt
to
awaken
him
swing
tunstall
advised
against
it
luke
tweezy
and
he
had
a
parting
drink
together
then
the
took
what
was
left
of
the
second
bottle
of
whiskey
the
first
was
but
a
memory
to
the
bar
and
endeavoured
to
chivvy
a
rebate
out
of
the
bartender
but
such
a
procedure
was
decidedly
not
the
happy
heart
method
of
doing
business
luke
tweezy
much
to
his
disgust
for
he
never
drank
except
in
the
way
of
trade
was
forced
to
carry
his
bottle
with
him
when
he
went
swing
sapient
young
person
walked
casually
to
the
window
and
watched
luke
tweezy
cross
the
street
to
calloway
store
then
he
returned
to
racey
table
racey
turned
his
tousled
head
sidewise
and
whispered
from
a
corner
of
his
mouth
help
me
out
to
tom
kane
stable
out
o
town
and
there
wo
anybody
bother
us
racey
come
alive
urged
swing
tunstall
making
a
great
business
of
shaking
awake
his
drunken
friend
you
do
wan
na
stay
here
no
longer
i
know
a
fine
place
where
you
can
sleep
it
off
ten
minutes
later
racey
and
swing
were
sitting
comfortably
on
a
pile
of
hay
in
tom
kane
new
stable
racey
pulled
off
his
boots
flopped
down
on
the
hay
and
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
he
wiggled
his
toes
luxuriously
and
laughed
gawd
said
he
think
o
that
old
skinflint
buying
nearly
two
bottles
of
whiskey
bet
that
lay
heavy
on
his
mind
for
as
much
as
a
month
what
you
lookin
at
me
like
that
for
yeah
i
ask
if
i
was
you
i
shore
would
what
was
yore
bright
idea
of
tellin
luke
tweezy
we
were
gon
na
ride
for
jack
harpe
so
to
watch
him
so
he
know
it
so
he
know
it
so
he
know
it
the
man
sits
there
and
says
he
know
and
you
call
me
a
thickskull
which
yore
head
has
got
mine
snowed
under
thataway
ca
you
see
you
droolin
fool
that
now
they
know
as
much
as
we
do
no
oh
no
racey
denied
with
a
superior
smile
not
never
i
ai
saying
they
might
know
as
much
as
you
do
by
yoreself
but
not
while
you
got
the
benefit
of
my
brains
they
wo
know
as
much
as
we
do
possibil
and
what
did
you
bite
me
for
pursued
swing
disregarding
the
slur
hell
bells
if
you
bit
luke
i
would
have
a
word
to
say
but
why
pick
on
me
well
you
bumped
my
head
so
hard
i
saw
sparks
so
we
even
say
stop
squallin
about
yore
hand
i
did
bite
you
half
as
hard
as
i
might
have
not
half
you
can
still
use
the
hand
all
right
ca
you
yeah
well
then
you
ai
got
anything
to
cry
about
not
a
thing
talk
sense
will
you
you
got
us
into
a
fine
mess
you
have
a
mess
guess
i
fooled
him
all
right
racey
said
with
irritating
complacency
what
was
you
trying
to
do
anyway
swing
snarled
glaring
at
his
friend
what
was
the
notion
of
tearin
off
all
them
confidences
about
bein
busted
and
yore
dear
friends
at
the
bar
s
and
how
you
and
me
was
gon
na
play
detective
and
to
think
providence
lets
a
like
you
go
on
living
it
ai
reasonable
that
business
of
telling
luke
we
was
busted
grinned
racey
and
asking
him
for
a
loan
was
just
so
i
could
work
up
roundabout
and
natural
like
to
how
the
bar
s
bunch
was
my
personal
friends
and
how
we
were
gon
na
ride
for
jack
harpe
and
watch
him
on
their
account
i
wanted
him
to
know
those
things
and
i
could
slam
out
and
tell
him
dry
so
could
i
it
would
sound
natural
it
would
make
him
think
the
wrong
way
you
bet
luke
tweezy
ai
a
plumb
fool
for
all
he
made
the
mistake
of
denying
he
knowed
jack
harpe
that
was
a
bad
one
yeah
but
lookit
swing
we
know
that
when
lanpher
spoke
of
a
front
yard
there
in
the
hotel
corral
he
meant
the
bar
s
range
aw
right
while
shore
jack
harpe
wants
to
hire
us
to
do
his
dirty
work
which
means
being
rubbed
out
by
our
own
friends
likely
would
he
let
us
ride
for
him
if
he
thought
the
bar
s
was
paying
us
to
watch
him
not
if
he
knowed
what
he
was
doing
admitted
swing
that
why
i
got
so
greasy
and
confidential
with
mister
luke
tweezy
so
jack
harpe
will
know
and
luke
will
tell
him
will
luke
tell
him
luke
will
run
to
him
i
gamble
jack
harpe
knows
the
awful
worst
already
so
we
be
safe
enough
to
go
to
jack
morning
bright
and
early
and
tell
him
we
decided
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
our
services
but
i
thought
we
figured
not
to
ride
for
him
said
the
now
thoroughly
bewildered
swing
of
course
we
ai
in
words
of
one
syllable
swing
i
want
to
find
out
if
it
is
the
bar
s
jack
harpe
going
against
well
then
we
knowing
what
we
know
and
jack
harpe
knowing
what
we
know
he
knows
if
he
turns
us
down
after
offering
us
the
job
yesterday
not
only
give
us
the
absolute
proof
we
want
but
it
make
him
turn
his
wolf
loose
p
d
q
and
that
last
will
be
good
medicine
because
if
i
any
judge
he
ai
ready
to
start
anything
yet
awhile
and
i
notice
when
a
gent
ai
ready
and
has
to
jump
anyhow
he
a
heap
likely
to
fall
down
and
smear
himself
all
over
the
landscape
the
man
right
said
swing
but
it
the
oddest
number
alla
same
i
ever
did
see
all
kinds
of
clues
to
a
crime
and
no
crime
yet
it
come
said
racey
dawson
grimly
jack
harpe
is
one
bad
actor
what
you
got
against
him
i
mean
anything
particular
besides
yore
natural
dislike
swing
tunstall
at
times
was
blessed
with
flashes
of
penetrating
shrewdness
i
ai
got
any
use
for
him
thassall
much
emphasis
on
the
part
of
racey
dawson
swing
nodded
see
him
at
moccasin
spring
was
his
drawled
question
i
did
say
so
stiffly
you
did
have
to
and
you
do
not
now
i
see
it
all
and
you
yawpin
out
real
loud
how
interested
you
are
in
seeing
how
the
bar
s
gets
a
square
deal
and
letting
out
only
a
small
peep
about
old
dale
and
thinking
yo
foolin
swing
to
a
oh

the
dale
ranch
that

worrying
you
alla
time
i
know
racey
actually
got
a
girl

of
suspicioned
it
but

you
fret
racey
i
keep
yore
secret
till

but
lookit
resumed
swing
tunstall
when
the
dust
of
conflict
was
beginning
to
settle
and
he
was
poking
about
in
the
hay
in
search
of
three
and
his
pocket
knife
lookit
racey

say
anything
to
luke
about
yore
being
friendly
with
this
dale
party

saving
that
about

to
tell
to
jack

a

anxious
to
see
what

chapter
x
the

and
uninterestedly

his
eye
brightened
and

sat
up
with
a
jerk
i
shove
the
door

farther
open

swing
making
as

i
going

and

was
the
back
porch
of
the
blue
pigeon
store
exclamations
and
laudable
desire
to
see

called
forth
by
the
sudden
appearance
on
the
back
porch
of
two
girls

held

strip
of

make
me
laugh
this
is
shore
one
on
you
racey
do
you
wish
now
you
had
made
out
to
be
so
drunk
lookit
luke
he
something
in
a
paper
poke
they
it
he
musta
bought
some
candy
i
bet
they
all
of
a
dime
worth
in
that
bag
the
spendthrift
how
he
must
like
them
girls
it
yore
girl
he
shining
up
to
special
racey
ai
he
the
look
out
racey
you
wo
have
a
chance
alongside
of
luke
tweezy
swing
said
racey
in
a
voice
ominously
calm
and
level
if
you
do
shut
yore
trap
i
shore
wrastle
you
down
and
tromp
on
yore
stummick
so
saying
he
reached
for
swing
tunstall
but
the
latter
watchful
person
that
he
was
eluded
the
clutching
hands
and
hurried
through
the
doorway
racey
seething
with
rage
could
only
sit
and
hug
his
knees
while
swing
went
up
on
the
porch
and
was
introduced
to
the
two
girls
it
was
some
balm
to
his
tortured
soul
to
see
how
ill
luke
tweezy
took
advent
did
luke
really
like
molly
dale
the
old
goat
why
the
man
was
old
enough
to
be
her
father
and
did
she
like
him
lordy
man
alive
how
could
she
but
luke
tweezy
had
money
girls
liked
money
racey
knew
that
he
had
known
a
girl
to
marry
a
more
undesirable
human
being
than
luke
tweezy
simply
because
the
man
was
rich
personally
he
racey
dawson
were
he
a
girl
would
prefer
the
honest
heart
to
all
the
wealth
in
the
territory
but
girls
were
queer
and
sometimes
did
queer
things
molly
was
she
queer
he
did
know
she
looked
sensible
yet
why
was
she
so
infernally
polite
to
luke
tweezy
she
did
have
to
smile
at
him
when
he
spoke
to
her
it
was
necessary
racey
spirit
groaned
within
him
finally
the
spectacle
of
the
chattering
group
on
the
back
porch
of
the
blue
pigeon
proved
more
than
racey
could
stand
he
retreated
into
a
dark
corner
of
the
barn
and
lay
down
on
the
hay
but
he
did
not
go
to
sleep
far
from
it
later
he
removed
his
boots
stuffed
them
full
of
hay
and
hunkered
down
behind
a
dismounted
over
which
a
had
been
flung
with
a
short
length
of
rope
and
several
handfuls
of
hay
he
propped
the
boots
in
such
a
position
that
they
stuck
out
beyond
the
ten
or
twelve
inches
and
gave
every
evidence
of
human
occupation
boosting
up
with
a
bushel
basket
the
stiff
canvas
at
the
end
opposite
the
boots
he
made
the
stretch
long
enough
and
high
enough
to
conceal
the
important
fact
that
there
were
no
legs
or
body
attached
to
the
boots
which
being
done
racey
took
up
a
strategic
position
behind
an
upended
crate
near
the
doorway
he
proceeded
to
wait
he
waited
quite
a
while
the
afternoon
drained
away
the
sun
set
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
racey
heard
footsteps
swing
tunstall
he
know
his
step
anywhere
the
individual
making
the
footsteps
came
to
the
doorway
of
the
barn
halted
an
instant
then
walked
in
almost
at
once
he
stumbled
over
the
boots
then
racey
sprang
upon
his
back
with
a
joyous
shout
and
slammed
him
headforemost
over
the
into
the
pile
of
hay
the
man
swore
and
the
voice
was
not
that
of
swing
tunstall
on
the
heels
of
this
unwelcome
discovery
racey
made
another
the
man
had
dragged
out
a
knife
from
under
his
armpit
and
was
squirmingly
endeavouring
to
make
play
with
it
racey
intended
practical
joke
on
swing
tunstall
was
in
a
fair
way
to
become
a
tragedy
on
himself
there
was
no
time
to
make
explanations
even
had
racey
been
so
inclined
the
man
was
strong
and
the
knife
was
long
and
presumably
sharp
racey
pinioning
his
opponent
knife
arm
with
one
hand
and
his
teeth
flashed
out
his
gun
and
smartly
clipped
the
man
over
the
head
with
the
barrel
instantly
so
far
as
an
active
participation
in
the
affair
of
the
moment
the
man
ceased
to
function
he
lay
limp
as
a
sodden
moccasin
and
breathed
stertorously
racey
knelt
at
his
side
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
top
of
the
man
head
the
palm
came
away
warmly
wet
racey
replaced
his
gun
in
its
holster
and
pulled
the
senseless
one
out
on
the
barn
floor
near
the
doorway
where
he
could
see
him
better
the
man
was
luke
tweezy
racey
sat
down
and
began
to
pull
on
his
boots
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
remaining
in
the
barn
tweezy
was
not
badly
hurt
the
blow
on
the
head
had
resulted
so
far
as
racey
could
discover
later
he
was
to
learn
that
his
diagnosis
had
been
correct
in
a
mere
scalp
wound
racey
when
his
boots
were
on
picked
up
his
hat
at
least
he
thought
it
was
his
hat
when
he
put
it
on
however
it
proved
a
poor
fit
he
had
taken
tweezy
hat
by
mistake
he
dropped
it
on
the
floor
and
turned
to
pick
up
his
own
where
it
lay
behind
the
but
as
we
wheeled
a
flicker
of
white
showed
inside
the
crown
of
tweezy
hat
where
it
lay
on
the
floor
racey
swung
back
stooped
down
and
turned
out
the
leather
sweatband
of
tweezy
hat
at
the
edge
of
which
had
been
revealed
the
bit
of
white
the
latter
proved
to
be
one
corner
of
a
folded
letter
without
the
least
compunction
racey
tucked
this
letter
into
the
breast
pocket
of
his
flannel
shirt
then
he
set
about
searching
tweezy
clothing
with
thoroughness
but
other
than
the
odds
and
odds
usually
to
be
found
in
a
man
pockets
there
was
nothing
to
interest
the
searcher
racey
carefully
turned
back
the
sweatband
of
the
hat
placed
the
headpiece
on
top
of
the
and
departed
he
went
as
far
as
the
happy
heart
corral
behind
the
corral
he
sat
down
on
his
heels
and
took
out
the
letter
he
had
purloined
from
luke
tweezy
he
opened
the
envelope
and
read
the
enclosure
by
the
light
of
matches
shielded
behind
his
hat
the
letter
ran
dear
friend
luke
i
do
think
much
of
your
plan
too
dangerous
the
land
office
is
getting
stricter
every
day
this
thing
must
be
absolutely
legal
in
every
way
you
ca
bull
ahead
and
trust
to
luck
there
are
any
holes
there
must
be
any
holes
not
a
damn
hole
try
my
plan
the
one
i
discussed
so
thoroughly
with
you
last
week
it
will
take
longer
perhaps
but
it
is
absolutely
safe
you
must
learn
to
be
more
careful
with
the
law
from
now
on
luke
i
know
what
i
talking
about
i
tell
you
plainly
if
you
do
accept
my
scheme
and
work
to
it
religiously
i
out
of
the
deal
absolutely
i
not
going
to
risk
my
liberty
because
of
other
people
foolhardiness
show
this
letter
to
jack
harpe
and
let
me
know
your
decision
another
thing
impress
upon
jack
the
necessity
of
you
two
keeping
publicly
apart
until
after
the
deal
is
sprung
when
you
talk
to
him
go
off
somewheres
where
no
one
will
see
you
i
heard
he
spoke
to
you
on
the
street
lampher
told
me
this
must
not
happen
again
while
we
are
partners
do
tell
doc
coffin
outfit
more
than
they
need
to
know
yours
truly
jacob
pooley
racey
blew
out
the
fourth
match
and
folded
the
letter
with
care
and
replaced
it
in
the
envelope
he
sat
back
on
his
heels
and
looked
up
into
the
darkening
sky
jacob
pooley
well
well
if
fat
jakey
pooley
the
register
of
the
district
was
mixed
up
in
the
business
the
opposition
would
have
its
work
cut
out
in
advance
yes
indeedy
for
no
man
could
walk
more
convincingly
the
tight
rope
of
the
law
than
fat
jakey
racey
dawson
did
not
know
fat
jakey
except
by
sight
but
he
had
heard
most
of
the
tales
told
of
the
gentleman
and
they
were
many
of
them
were
accepted
by
the
countryside
as
gospel
truth
perhaps
half
of
them
were
true
a
cunning
dishonest
and
indefatigable
featherer
of
a
lucrative
political
nest
that
was
fat
jakey
racey
dawson
sat
and
thought
hard
through
two
cigarettes
then
he
thumbed
out
the
butt
got
to
his
feet
and
started
to
return
to
the
hotel
for
it
had
suddenly
come
upon
him
that
he
was
hungry
but
halfway
round
the
corral
an
idea
impinged
upon
his
consciousness
with
the
force
of
a
bullet
gawdamighty
he
muttered
i
am
a
jack
he
turned
and
retraced
his
steps
to
the
corner
of
the
corral
here
he
stopped
and
removed
his
spurs
he
stuffed
a
spur
into
each
hip
pocket
and
moved
cautiously
and
on
tiptoe
toward
tom
kane
barn
it
was
almost
full
night
by
now
but
in
the
west
still
glowed
the
faintly
red
streak
of
the
dying
embers
of
the
day
racey
suddenly
bethought
him
that
the
red
streak
was
at
his
back
therefore
he
dropped
on
all
fours
and
proceeded
catwise
he
was
too
late
before
he
reached
the
back
of
the
barn
he
heard
the
feet
of
two
people
crunching
the
hard
ground
in
front
of
it
the
sound
of
the
footsteps
died
out
on
the
grass
between
the
barn
and
the
houses
fronting
on
main
street
racey
hurrying
after
and
still
on
all
fours
suddenly
saw
the
dark
shape
of
a
tall
man
loom
in
front
of
him
he
halted
perforce
his
own
special
brand
of
bull
luck
was
with
him
the
dark
shape
walking
almost
without
a
sound
shaved
his
body
so
closely
as
it
passed
that
he
felt
the
stir
of
the
air
against
his
face
when
the
men
had
gone
on
a
few
yards
racey
looked
over
his
shoulder
silhouetted
against
the
streak
of
dying
red
was
the
upper
half
of
jack
harpe
torso
there
was
no
mistaking
the
set
of
that
head
and
those
shoulders
both
it
and
them
were
unmistakable
jack
harpe
racey
swore
behind
his
teeth
if
only
he
could
have
reached
the
barn
in
time
to
hear
what
the
two
men
had
said
to
each
other
after
a
decent
interval
racey
went
on
the
happy
heart
was
the
nearest
saloon
he
felt
reasonably
certain
that
luke
tweezy
would
go
there
to
have
his
cut
head
dressed
he
had
racey
his
back
against
the
bar
looked
on
with
interest
at
the
bandaging
of
luke
tweezy
by
the
proprietor
yep
said
luke
sitting
sidewise
in
the
chair
stubbed
my
toe
against
a
cordwood
stick
in
front
of
tom
kane
barn
and
hit
my
head
on
a
rock
knocked
me
silly
sh
think
it
might
grunted
the
proprietor
attending
to
his
job
with
difficulty
because
luke
squirm
hold
still
will

yo
taking
twice
as
many
stitches
as

luke
i
ai
denied
the
proprietor
and
i
got
two
more
to
take
hold
still
do
need
to
deafen
me
squalled
luke
indignantly
shut
up
ordered
the
proprietor
who
for
that
he
did
not
owe
any
money
to
luke
was
not
prepared
to
pay
much
attention
to
his
fussing
if
you
think
i
enjoying
this
you
got
another
guess
coming
and
if
you
do
like
the
way
i
doing
it
you
can
do
it
yoreself
luke
stood
up
at
last
a
white
bandage
encircling
his
head
said
that
he
was
much
obliged
and
would
like
to
borrow
a
lantern
for
a
few
moments
aw
you
do
need
any
lantern
objected
the
proprietor
i
forgot
to
fill
mine
anyway

the
dark
that

tweezy
when

fell
down

all
my
money

out
of
my
pocket

a
lantern
then
grumbled
the
proprietor
ten
minutes
later
luke
tweezy
frantically
quartering
the
floor
of
tom
kane
barn
heard
a
slight
sound
and
looked
up
to
see
racey
dawson
and
swing
tunstall
standing
in
the
doorway
i
did
know
you
fell
down
the
barn
racey
observed
there

luke
ungraciously
so
there

go
for
to
lacerate
i
ai
owing
you
a
dime
you
know
to
this
luke
tweezy
made
no
comment
but
he
resumed
his
squattering
about
the
floor
and
his
poking
and
delving
in
the
piles
of
hay
he
raised
a
dust
that
flew
up
in
clouds
he
coughed
and
snorted
and
snuffed
racey
and
swing
tunstall
laughed
makes
you
think
of
a
do
he
grinned
racey
how
much
did
you
lose
luke
two
bits
at
this
luke
looked
up
sharply
seems
to
me
you
got
over
yore
drunk
pretty
quick
said
he
oh
my
liquor
never
stays
by
me
a
great
while
racey
told
him
easily
that
the
beauty
of
being
young
when
you
get
old
and
toothless
an
deecrepit
like
some
people
not
to

racey
and
swing
moved
apart
to
let
him
through
red
kane
entered
stared
at
the
spectacle
of
luke
tweezy
and
his
bobbing
lantern
stared
and
stared
again

he
demanded

so
luke
was
driven
out
much
against
his
will
and
racey
and
swing
roamed
around
to
the
dance
hall
here
at
a
table
in
the
ell
where
the
bar
stretched
its
length
they
could
sit
and
talk
unheard
under
cover
of
the
music
but
how
come
you
had
yore
boots
off
swing
desired
to
know
when
a
table
a
bottle
and
two
glasses
were
between
them
do
try
to
tell

stuck
behind

on
purpose
to

racey
with
a
sly
smile
those
boots
were
laid
out
all

for

but
why

me
perplexedly
because
swing
old

i
did
like

this
afternoon
the
more
i
saw
you
over
there
on
that
porch
the
less
i

i
took

my
boots
and
hid
careful
like
behind
the
so
they
stick
out
some
and
you
see
and
think
i
was
there
asleep
and
naturally
you
go
for
to
wake
me
up
and
would
think
of
looking
behind
the
crate
where
i
was
laying
for
you
all
ready
to
hop
on
yore
neck
the
second
you
stooped
over

tried
to

you

in

to
prevent

jack
harpe
speaking
racey
and
swing
had
met
him
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
lainey
hotel
shortly
after
breakfast
the
following
morning
and
racey
had
told
him
of
their
ultimate
decision
as
he
spoke
harpe
braced
an
arm
against
the
side
of
the
building
crossed
his
feet
and
scratched
the
back
of
his
head
i
shore
sorry
he
went
on
but
i
like
to
call
off
that
proposition
about

on
my
ranch
i
told
you
you
could
have
it
i
owe
you
somethin
what

to
a
month
wages
apiece
racey
shook
a
slow
head
and
hooked
his
thumbs
in
his
belt
you
owe
us
a
nickel
he
told
jack
harpe
take
back
yore
gold
honest
ourselves
of
course
we
may
starve
but
that
between
friends
in
words
of
one
syllable
what
do
we
care
for
poverty
or
precious
stones
jack
harpe
followed
this
flight
of
fancy
with
an
uncertain
smile
alla
same
he
said
i
wish
you
lem
me
give
you
that
month
wages
i
feel
better
about
it
like
i
was
paying

bets

of
right
nodded
racey
dawson
we
still
do
want
any
money
we
satisfied
if
you
are
yep
we
a
heap
satisfied
now
i
ai
contented
much
that
tough
commiserated
jack
harpe
and
dropped
at
his
side
the
arm
he
had
braced
against
the
wall
of
the
hotel
also
he
straightened
his
crossed
leg
his
air
and
manner
even
to
the
most
casual
of
eyes
took
on
a
sudden
brisk
watchfulness
that
tough
repeated
jack
harpe
and
added
a
headshake
for
good
measure
ai
it
racey
dawson
said
brightly
but
maybe
you
can
help
me
out
lookit
i
ai
trying
to
pry
y
understand
i
the
least
prying
feller
in
four
states
but
this
here
ranch
of
yores
which
got
anything
to
do
with
the
and
wo
cut
any
corners
off
the
bar
s
might
it
by
any
chance
overlap
on
dale
ranch
overlap
the
dale
ranch
what
you
talkin
about
i
dunno
racey
replied
simply
i
trying
to
find
out
jack
harpe
laughed
his
soundless
laugh
i
dunno
what
it
is
to
you
he
said
but
if
my
ranch
do
come
near
the
bar
s
how
can
it
hit
the
dale
place
stranger
things
than
that
have
happened
but
still
alla
same
shore
not
admire
to
see
any
hardship
come
to
old
chin
whisker
dale
i
mean
if
racey
had
hoped
to
gain
any
effect
by
mentioning
chin
whisker
he
was
disappointed
jack
harpe
was
wearing
his
poker
face
at
the
moment
i
would
like
that
any
myself
concurred
jack
harpe
old
dale
seems
like
a
good
feller
sort
of
shackles
along
a
mite
too
shiftless
maybe
but
his
daughter
takes
the
curse
off
do
she
we
were
talking
about
the
daughter
racey
pointed
out
swing
tunstall
immediately
stepped
to
one
side
there
was
a
something
in
racey
tone
but
jack
harpe
did
not
press
the
point
he
smiled
widely
instead
we
were
talking
about
her
for
a
fact
he
assented
coming
right
down
to
cases
we
oughta
be
about
done
talking
ought
we
depends
said
racey
it
all
depends
i
just
like
folks
to
know
that
i
take
it
a
heap
personal
if
any
tough
luck
came
to
old
dale
and
his
ranch
meanin
what
i
said
no
more
no
less
what
you
said

be
took
more
ways
than
one
what

flashed
racey
what
i
said
concerns
only
the
gent
or
gents
who
are
fixing
to
colddeck
old
dale
nobody
else
so
what
do
you

mister

paws
most
awful
full
of

that
the
way

looks
to
a
man
up
a
tree
me
i
a
great
hand
for
mindin
my
own
business
but
yo
like
luke
tweezy
thataway
cut
in
racey
that
what
always
doing
who
luke
tweezy
so
you
learned
yore
lesson
chuckled
racey
it
was
about
time
guess
you
must
bothered
luke
tweezy
some
when
you
spoke
to
him
that
day
in
front
of
the
happy
heart
just
before
you
and
lanpher
crawled
yore
cayuses
and
rode
to
dale
on
soogan
creek
remember
huh
i
do
you
said
you
later
luke
and
he
speak
back
just
kept
on
untying
his
hoss
and
keeping
his
head
bent
down
like
he
had
heard
a
word
you
said
huh
damfunny
assented
jack
harpe
with
an
odd
smoothness
yeah
you
fellers
that
do
know
each
other
are
all
of
that
tell
me
something
do
you
meet
in
the
cemetery
by
a
dead
nigger
grave
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
at
midnight
or
what
i
free
to
admit
i
puzzled
she
all
a
heap
too
mysterious
for
me
crazy
talk
commented
jack
harpe
you
been
wallowing
in
the
nosepaint
and
letting
yore
imagination
run
on
the
range
too
much
maybe
racey
said
equably
maybe
you
ca
tell
as
a
young
one
i
had
a
powerful
imagination
i
might
have
it
yet
jack
harpe
gazed
long
and
silently
at
racey
dawson
the
latter
returned
the
stare
with
interest
with
the
sixth
sense
possessed
by
most
men
who
live
in
a
country
where
the
law
and
the
sixshooter
are
practically
synonymous
terms
racey
was
conscious
that
marie
the
happy
heart
lookout
had
suddenly
drifted
up
to
his
left
flank
and
now
stood
with
arms
akimbo
on
the
inner
edge
of
the
sidewalk
her
body
was
turned
partly
toward
him
but
her
head
was
turned
wholly
away
evidently
there
was
something
of
interest
farther
up
the
street
racey
moved
slightly
to
the
left
he
wished
to
have
a
little
more
light
on
jack
harpe
right
side
the
harpe
right
hand
it
was
in
the
shadow
jack
harpe
pivoted
to
face
racey
the
light
from
the
hotel
window
fell
on
the
right
hand
the
member
was
near
the
gun
butt
but
not
suggestively
near
listen
here
said
jack
harpe
suddenly
in
a
snarling
whisper
designed
solely
for
the
ears
of
racey
dawson
i
dunno
what
you
been
at
but
just
for
yore
better
information
i
telling
you
that
i
always
get
what
i
go
after
whether
it
land
cows
horses
or
women
i
get
what
i
want
nothing
ever
has
stopped
me
nothing
ever
will
stop
me
do
forget
thanks
smiled
racey
i
try
not
to
and
here
somethin
else
what
i
take
i
keep
always
always
is
a
long
word
there
a
longer
what
death
meanin
that
folks
who
ai
for
me
are
against
me
looks
like
yore
friend
there
wanted
to
talk
to
you
so
long
abruptly
jack
harpe
faced
about
and
went
into
the
hotel
racey
felt
a
touch
on
his
arm
he
turned
to
find
that
marie
had
almost
bumped
into
him
her
head
was
still
turned
away
one
of
her
hands
was
groping
for
his
arm
her
fingers
clutched
his
wrist
then
slid
upward
to
the
crook
of
his
elbow
le
go
across
the
street
she
said
in
a
breathless
voice
and
pulled
him
forward
her
body
as
she
pulled
was
pressed
tightly
against
him
she
seemed
to
hang
upon
him
and
all
to
the
discomfort
and
mental
anguish
of
racey
dawson
he
was
no
prude
his
moral
sense
had
never
oppressed
him
but
this
calm
appropriation
of
him
was
too
much
but
he
accompanied
her
for
there
was
swing
tunstall
a
nothing
if
not
interested
observer
other
folk
as
well
were
spectators
to
shake
loose
marie
grip
to
run
away
from
her
would
make
him
ridiculous
he
continued
to
accompany
the
young
woman
quite
as
if
her
kidnapping
of
him
was
a
matter
of
course
in
the
middle
of
the
street
they
were
halted
by
the
headlong
approach
of
a
rapidly
driven
buckboard
as
it
swept
past
in
front
of
them
the
light
of
the
lantern
clamped
on
the
dashboard
flashed
on
their
faces
dawson
cried
the
driver
her
fresh
young
voice
lifting
to
be
heard
above
the
drum
of
the
hoofs
and
the
grind
of
the
rolling
wheels
and
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
miss
molly
dale
racey
did
not
reply
to
the
greeting
he
was
too
aghast
at
the
mischance
that
had
presented
him
while
arm
in
arm
with
a
person
of
marie
stamp
to
the
eyes
of
one
upon
whom
he
was
striving
to
make
an
impression
what
would
molly
dale
think
the
worst
of
course
how
could
she
help
it
appearances
were
all
against
him
then
he
recalled
that
she
had
been
the
sole
occupant
of
the
buckboard
that
she
had
called
him
by
name
the
light
had
fallen
on
the
face
of
the
lookout
it
was
possible
that
she
might
not
know
who
marie
was
although
it
was
no
more
than
just
possible
he
cuddled
the
potentiality
to
him
as
if
it
had
been
a
purring
kitten
he
allowed
marie
to
lead
him
across
the
sidewalk
and
into
the
shadow
between
tom
kane
house
and
an
empty
shack
but
here
in
the
thick
darkness
he
paused
and
looked
back
to
see
whether
swing
tunstall
were
following
swing
was
not
he
was
entering
the
hotel
in
company
with
windy
taylor
marie
jerked
at
his
arm
she
urged
impatiently
gon
na
take
root
or
what
he
accompanied
his
captor
to
the
extremely
private
and
secluded
rear
of
tom
kane
new
barn
here
were
the
remains
of
a
broken
wagon
several
wheels
and
the
major
portion
of
a
venerable
and
useless
stove
marie
released
his
arm
and
racey
sat
down
on
the
stove
but
it
was
a
very
useless
stove
and
it
collapsed
crashingly
under
his
weight
later
he
learned
that
even
when
it
had
been
a
working
member
of
tom
kane
menage
the
stove
had
been
held
together
mainly
by
trust
in
the
lord
and
a
good
deal
of
baling
wire
clumsy
marie
hissed
as
he
arose
hurriedly
all
thumbs
and
left
feet
why
do
you
make
a
more
noise
i
bet
you
could
if
you
tried
say
racey
snapped
temperishly
for
a
sharp
corner
of
the
stove
door
had
totally
obscured
his
sense
of
proportion
say
i
did
ask
to
come
over
here
with
you
what
do
you
want
anyway
want
you
to
shut
up
and
pay
attention
to
me
she
flung
back
i
thought
you
was
gon
na
leave
town
why
ai
you
changed
my
mind
was
his
answer
why
ca
you
do
what
you
said
you
do
she
was
quite
vehement
about
it
i
got
a
right
to
change
my
mind
ai
i
go
dammit
why
ca
you
go
you
gave
them
a
chance
to
even
up
when
you
ran
that
blazer
on
doc
coffin
an
honey
hoke
there
in
the
starlight
let
it
go
at
that
whadda
you
want
to
hang
round
here
for
do
you
know
that
every
hour
you
stay
here
makes
it
more
dangerous
for
you
oh
you
can
laugh
that
all
you
do
when
a
feller
does
her
level
best
to
see
you
do
come
to
any
harm
gawd
i
could
shake
you
for
a
fool
was
that
what
you
pulled
me
alla
way
over
here
to
tell
me
he
inquired
somewhat
miffed
at
her
acerbity
i
pulled
you
across
the
street
because
if
i
left
you
where
i
found
you
you
would
lived
a
minute
the
starlight
was
bright
enough
to
reveal
to
him
the
set
and
earnest
tenseness
of
her
features
i
would
lived
a
minute
huh
was
his
comment
i
did
see
anybody
round
there
fit
and
able
to
put
in
a
period
it
was
anybody
you
could
do
you
remember
what
i
said
about
a
knife
in
the
night
or
a
shot
in
the
dark
man

you
have
to
be
killed
before
you
convinced
well
uh

standin
alongside
of
you

while

to
listen
to
what
you
was
sayin

nerve

said
admiringly
and
helplessly
nerve

she
denied

would
shoot
through
me
i
know
that
well
enough
why
would
he
and
how
do
you
know
because
and
i
do
that
enough
which
particular
is
he
i
ai
sayin
do
you
like
him
as
much
as
that
shrewdly
not
the
way
you
mean
dispassionately
then
who

he
i
ai
sayin
i
tell

best
for
you
but
i
have
the
luck

time

had
just
happened
to
strike
for
a
night
off
this
i
dunno
where

i
thought
you
did
dare
let
them
see
you
have
anythin
to
do
with
me
i
did
and
i
do
but
i
had
to
i

let

but
i
wan
na
tell
you
this
if
yo
bound
to
go
on
playin
the
fool
keep
and
walk
round
a
lighted
window
like
it
a
swamp
she
dodged
past
him
and
was
gone
he
made
no
move
to
follow
he
pushed
back
his
hat
and
scratched
his
head
helluva
town
this
is
he
muttered
ca
stand
still
any
more
without
having
some
sport
draw
a
fine
sight
where
you
feel
it
most
after
she
left
racey
dawson
marie
diagonalled
across
main
street
passed
between
the
dance
hall
and
dolan
warehouse
and
made
her
way
to
the
most
outlying
of
the
shacks
scattered
at
the
back
of
the
dance
hall
she
entered
the
shack
felt
for
the
matches
in
the
tin
nailed
against
the
wall
and
struck
one
to
light
the
lamp
like
the
provident
miss
she
was
she
turned
the
wick
down
after
lighting
in
order
that
the
chimney
might
heat
slowly
it
may
have
been
the
dimness
of
the
lighted
lamp
it
may
have
been
that
she
was
not
as
observing
as
usual
but
certainly
she
had
no
inkling
of
another
presence
in
the
same
room
with
her
till
she
had
slipped
out
of
her
waist
then
a
man
in
the
corner
of
the
room
swore
yore
soul
to
were
his
remarks
in
part
what
did
you
horn
in
for
chapter
xii
the
discovery
racey
dawson
did
not
remain
long
idle
after
marie
departure
the
girl
had
barely
entered
the
narrow
passage
between
the
warehouse
and
the
dance
hall
before
he
was
crossing
the
street
at
a
point
beyond
the
jail
where
there
were
no
shafts
of
light
from
open
windows
and
doorways
to
betray
him
racey
dawson
circled
the
sheriff
house
and
tippytoed
past
the
outermost
of
the
six
shacks
at
the
rear
of
the
dance
hall
his
objective
was
the
starlight
saloon
his
purpose
to
discover
the
bushwhacker
who
had
tried
to
shoot
him
as
he
passed
the
outermost
shack
a
light
flashed
up
within
it
he
saw
marie
head
and
shoulder
silhouetted
against
the
curtain
he
recognized
her
immediately
by
the
heavy
mass
of
her
hair
no
other
woman
in
farewell
possessed
such
a
mop
racey
resolved
to
speak
with
marie
again
his
hand
was
lifted
in
readiness
to
knock
when
marie
visitor
spoke
racey
hand
promptly
dropped
at
his
side
he
had
recognized
the
voice
it
was
that
of
bull
the
starlight
bartender
the
shack
door
was
fairly
well
constructed
at
least
there
were
no
cracks
in
it
but
a
log
wall
has
oftentimes
an
open
chink
this
wall
had
one
between
the
third
and
fourth
tiers
of
logs
not
more
than
a
yard
from
the
door
racey
crouched
till
his
eyes
were
on
a
level
with
the
narrow
crack
he
could
not
see
bull
but
he
could
see
marie
apparently
she
was
not
according
her
visitor
the
slightest
attention
she
daintily
and
unhurriedly
hung
her
waist
over
the
back
of
a
chair
then
she
turned
up
the
lamp
removed
the
pins
from
her
abundant
hair
shook
it
down
and
began
to
brush
it
calmly
and
you
snarled
bull
advancing
to
the
table
where
he
was
within
range
of
racey
eyesight
i
spoke
to
you
what

do
it
for
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
him

brush
poised
in
one
you

she
drawled
at
him
i
tellin
you
because
i
felt
like

shot
forth
a
hand
and
grabbed
her
right
wrist
marie
as
a
whole
did
not
move
but
her
left
hand
dropped
languidly
and
nestled
in
the
overhang
of
her
bodice
bull
she
said
softly
staring
straight
into
the
evil
eyes
glowering
upon
her
bull
bad

affirmed

on

pink
palm

did
you

me
up

blustery
tone
i
did

i
ai

could
always
handle
you

the
time

sassed
him
there
in
here
marie
accidentally
dropped
her
brush
into
an
empty
pail
and
the
clatter
drowned
out
the
name
of
the
town
so
far
as
racey
was
concerned
but
marie
caught
the
name
for
she
straightened
with
a
start
and
stared
at
bull
yeah
continued
bull

it
huh
i
guess

that
was
where

slapped
yore
chops
and

to
broke
yore
neck
that
time
i
wish

she
repeated
and
that
town

you
think
of
them
two
names
together
because
that
was
the
town
where
he
throwed
you
down
the
stairs
bull
told
her

a
respectable
member
of

himself
jack
harpe
and
spends
most
of
his

chapter
xiii
a
bold
bad
man
bull
had
halted
a
moment
outside
the
door
of
the
shack
to
roll
a
cigarette
before
he
pulled
out
his
tobacco
bag
he
leaned
the
rifle
against
the
doorjamb
his
eyes
unaccustomed
to
the
darkness
did
not
see
the
crouching
racey
dawson
within
both
of
bull
hands
were
cupped
round
the
lighted
match
he
lifted
it
to
the
end
of
the
cigarette
he
sucked
in
his
breath
and
a
voice
whispered
drop
that
match
an
grab
yore
ears
bull
did
not
hesitate
to
obey
for
the
broad
cold
blade
of
a
bowie
rested
lightly
against
the
back
of
his
neck
bull
swayed
a
little
where
he
stood
i
got
yore
rifle
resumed
the
whisperer
walk
away
now
headin
about
right
do
make
too
much
noise
bull
did
not
make
too
much
noise
in
fact
he
made
hardly
any
it
is
safe
to
say
that
he
never
progressed
more
quietly
in
his
life
the
man
with
the
bowie
steered
him
to
a
safe
haven
behind
a
fat
white
boulder
half
buried
in
sumac
requested
the
captor
in
a
conversational
tone
we
can
be
right
comfortable
here
dawson
breathed
the
captive
took
you
a
long
time
to
find
it
out
said
racey
dawson
i
said
he
added
sharply
bull
obeyed
his
back
against
the
rock
and
was
careful
not
to
lower
his
hands
racey
hunkered
down
and
sat
on
a
spurless
heel
the
rifle
was
under
his
knee
he
had
exchanged
the
bowie
for
a
sixshooter
the
firearm
was
trained
in
the
general
direction
of
bull
stomach
racey
smiled
widely
he
felt
very
chipper
and
pleased
with
himself
he
was
managing
the
affair
well
he
thought
you
show
up
right
plain
against
that
white
rock
he
remarked
if
yo
figuring
to
gamble
with
me
think
of
that
whatcha
want
demanded
bull
sullenly
lots
of
things
replied
racey
shifting
a
foot
an
inch
to
the
left
i
the
most
wantin
feller

a
decided
head

racey
his
eyes

with
pleasure
under

wide
brim
of
his
hat
i
the
starlight
pretty
bright
remember

sudden
movement

over

silent
but
racey
believed
that
he
had
planted
the
seed
of
doubt
in
his
mind
and
another
thing
resumed

racey
but
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
worming
information
out
of
marie
would
not
be
easy
saving
his
life
was
one
thing
but
giving
up

be
quite
another

the
surprise
the
sun
lifting
over
the
rim
of
the
world
sprayed
its
rays
through
the
window
and
splashed
with
gold
the
face
of
racey
dawson
he
awoke
and
much
to
the
profane
disgust
of
swing
tunstall
shook
that
worthy
awake
immediately
aw
lem

you
begged

with
suspicious
meekness
reaching
surreptitiously
for
a

and
smashed
against
the
partition

that
starlight
proprietor
racey
said
calmly
as
he
picked
up
the
boot
and
dropped
it
out
of
the
window
good
dog
he
continued
presumably
addressing
a
canine
friend
without
leave
swing
nice
new
boot
alone
will
you
do
go
gnawin
at
it
thataway
it
ai
a
bone
swing
pulling
on
his
pants
left
the
room
hopping
physically
and
mentally
racey
rested
both
elbows
on
the
sill
and
waited
happily
for
his
comrade
to
appear
beneath
him
shucks
he
said
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
when
swing
shot
round
the
corner
of
the
hotel
i
shore
thought
there
was
a
dog
there
that
boot
i
could
have
took
my
bible
oath
there
was
a
great
big
black
feller
with
lots
of
teeth
down
there
i
saw
him
swing
shore
thought
i
did
must
been
mistaken
and
you
went
and
believed
me
and
got
splinters
in
yore
feet
because
you
were
in
such
a
hurry
never
mind
swing
here
the
other
one
he
jerked
the
boot
in
question
at
his
friend
head
and
sat
down
on
his
cot
to
complete
his
own
dressing
came
then
the
sound
of
a
prodigious
yawn
from
the
room
next
door
occupied
by
jack
harpe
a
cot
creaked
a
boot
was
scraped
along
the
floor
shore
must
be
a
sound
sleeper
said
racey
dawson
to
himself
if
he
really
did
just
wake
up
he
buckled
on
his
gunbelt
set
his
hat
on
one
ear
and
went
down
to
wash
his
face
and
hands
in
the
common
basin
on
the
outside
the
kitchen
door
but
swing
tunstall
was
before
him
and
was
disposed
to
make
an
issue
of
the
dropped
boots
only
by
his
superior
agility
was
racey
enabled
to
dodge
all
save
a
few
drops
of
a
full
bucket
of
water
djever
get
left
djever
get
left
singsonged
racey
from
the
corner
of
the
building
and
set
the
thumb
of
one
hand
to
his
nose
and
twiddled
opprobrious
fingers
at
his
comrade
you
wan
na
be
a
bit
quicker
when
you
go
to
souse
me
swing
yo
too
slow
a
lot
too
slow
yep
now
i
would
go
for
to
fling
that
pail
at
me
swing
you
might
bust
it
and
yore
carelessness
with
crockery
thataway
has
already
cost
you
ten
dollars
and
six
bits
this
was
too
much
for
the
ruffled
swing
waving
the
pail
he
pursued
his
tormentor
round
the
hotel
and
into
the
front
doorway
racey
fled
up
the
stairs
at
the
stair
foot
swing
gave
over
the
chase
and
returned
to
the
washbench
to
resume
his
racey
went
on
into
their
room
there
was
in
it
several
articles
belonging
to
swing
that
he
intended
to
throw
out
of
the
window
at
once
but
when
he
had
entered
the
room
and
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
he
did
not
touch
any
of
swing
belongings
instead
he
remained
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
floor
what
had
given
him
pause
was
the
fact
that
he
had
found
the
door
ajar
and
he
knew
with
absolute
certainty
that
he
had
closed
the
door
tightly
before
he
went
downstairs
it
is
the
vagrant
straw
that
shows
the
wind
direction
and
since
the
attempt
to
bushwhack
him
racey
was
not
overlooking
any
straws
the
door
had
been
ajar
why
there
was
no
closet
and
from
where
he
stood
he
could
see
under
both
cots
no
one
lay
concealed
in
the
room
the
bedclothes
on
swing
cot
had
not
been
touched
at
least
they
were
in
precisely
the
position
in
which
they
had
been
landed
when
thrown
back
by
swing
careless
hand
racey
did
not
believe
that
his
own
had
been
touched
either
but
the
saddlebags
and
lying
on
the
floor
at
the
head
of
his
cot
had
certainly
been
moved
he
recalled
distinctly
having
the
previous
evening
piled
the
on
top
of
the
saddlebags
and
now
the
saddlebags
were
on
top
of
the
he
glanced
at
swing
warbags
they
had
not
been
moved
he
wondered
if
jack
harpe
and
the
starlight
owner
were
still
in
their
rooms
he
listened
intently
hearing
no
sound
he
went
out
into
the
hall
and
knocked
gently
on
jack
harpe
door
and
called
him
softly
by
name
getting
no
reply
he
lifted
the
latch
and
walked
in
there
were
jack
harpe
saddlebags
and
rifle
in
a
corner
a
coat
lay
on
the
tumbled
blankets
of
the
cot
otherwise
the
room
was
empty
racey
went
out
being
careful
to
close
the
door
tightly
and
went
to
the
room
of
the
starlight
owner
this
room
too
was
empty
racey
returned
to
his
own
room
tossed
his
and
saddlebags
on
the
cot
and
began
feverishly
to
paw
through
their
contents
nothing
had
been
subtracted
from
or
added
to
the
heterogeneous
collection
of
articles
in
the
the
contents
of
the
saddlebag
were
in
their
familiar
disorder
there
was
nothing
in
or
about
the
saddlebag
to
arouse
suspicion
not
a
thing
he
unbuckled
the
flap
of
the
saddlebag
and
flipped
it
back
somebody
had
been
at
this
saddlebag
he
was
sure
of
it
his
extra
shirt
instead
of
being
wadded
into
the
of
the
saddlebag
on
top
of
a
pair
of
socks
had
been
stuffed
into
the
hinder
end
on
top
of
a
pair
of
underdrawers
which
underdrawers
should
by
rights
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
leather
but
there
was
something
else
at
the
bottom
of
the
saddlebag
it
was
something
long
and
hard
and
wrapped
in
the
buttonless
undershirt
despised
and
rejected
by
swing
racey
unrolled
the
undershirt
his
eyes
stared
in
genuine
horror
at
what
the
unrolling
revealed
it
was
the
commonest
of
butcher
knives
that
someone
busy
hand
had
wrapped
in
the
undershirt
but
what
was
not
nearly
so
common
was
that
the
broad
thin
blade
was
stained
with
blood
from
point
to
haft
the
steel
was
as
red
as
if
it
had
been
dipped
in
a
pail
of
paint
indeed
being
dry
it
looked
not
unlike
paint
but
racey
knew
that
it
was
not
paint
it
was
dry
before
it
was
wrapped
in
that
undershirt
he
said
to
himself
testing
the
blood
on
the
blade
with
a
speculative
fingernail
there
ai
a
mark
on
the
undershirt
gawd
here
it
is
again
the
earmark
of
a
crime
and
no
crime
yet
this
is
getting
monotonous
he
laid
down
the
knife
settled
his
hat
and
methodically
searched
swing
tunstall
warbags
it
turned
out
a
needless
precaution
he
had
felt
that
it
would
be
but
he
could
not
afford
to
take
any
risks
having
found
nothing
in
swing
warbags
save
his
friend
personal
belongings
racey
slid
the
knife
up
his
sleeve
and
went
downstairs
to
breakfast
on
the
way
he
stopped
a
moment
at
a
fortuitous
knothole
in
the
board
wall
when
he
passed
on
his
way
the
knife
was
no
longer
with
him
jack
harpe
was
still
eating
when
racey
eased
himself
into
the
chair
at
swing
right
hand
jack
harpe
nodded
to
racey
and
went
serenely
on
with
his
meal
racey
seized
knife
and
fork
squared
his
elbows
and
began
to
saw
at
his
steak
and
as
he
chewed
and
swallowed
and
sloshed
the
coffee
round
in
his
cup
in
order
to
get
the
full
benefit
of
the
sugar
he
wondered
whether
it
was
jack
harpe
or
bull
to
whom
he
was
indebted
for
the
butcher
knife
it
was
one
of
the
two
he
thought
who
else
could
it
be
he
believed
it
would
be
wise
to
spend
most
of
his
spare
time
in
his
room
at
least
until
he
knew
the
inwardness
of
the
incident
it
was
possible
that
the
man
who
had
secreted
the
knife
would
return
racey
might
well
be
in
line
for
other
even
more
delicate
attentions
before
going
up
to
his
room
racey
went
to
the
corral
he
had
left
his
out
all
night
he
mentioned
to
swing
in
the
hearing
of
jack
harpe
he
was
gone
five
minutes
when
he
returned
strangely
enough
minus
the
he
was
in
time
to
see
piney
jackson
dart
round
the
corner
of
the
blacksmith
shop
cup
his
hand
at
his
mouth
and
raise
a
stentorian
bellow
for
jake
rule
piney
did
not
wait
to
see
whether
the
sheriff
replied
to
his
call
instead
he
beckoned
violently
to
the
handful
of
men
grouped
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
hotel
over
he
bawled
look
what
i
found
here
this
morning
jack
harpe
and
the
owner
of
the
starlight
being
among
those
present
and
responding
to
the
invitation
racey
dawson
took
a
chance
and
went
with
the
rest
look
at
that
said
piney
jackson
indicating
a
individual
sitting
behind
the
woodpile
racey
and
the
other
spectators
went
round
the
woodpile
and
viewed
the
individual
the
latter
was
bull
the
starlight
bartender
and
he
was
dead
very
dead
his
throat
had
been
cut
from
ear
to
ear
he
was
a
ghastly
object
who
done
it
inquired
one
of
the
fools
that
infest
every
group
of
men
he
did
leave
any
card
the
blacksmith
replied
with
sarcasm
the
fool
asked
no
more
questions
came
then
jake
rule
and
kansas
casey
jake
a
rather
heavy
officer
old
at
the
business
began
to
sniff
about
for
clues
kansas
casey
laid
the
body
down
on
its
back
and
thoroughly
searched
the
pockets
of
the
clothing
one
thing
said
kansas
casey
looking
up
from
what
he
had
found
a
handful
of
silver
dollars
a
pocket
knife
and
a
silver
watch
robbery
was
the
motive
racey
looked
sidewise
from
under
his
eyebrows
at
jack
harpe
the
latter
was
staring
down
unmoved
at
the
dead
body
somebody
must
had
a
grudge
against
bull
offered
the
fool
you
think
so
said
piney
yo
a
real
bright
feller
the
fool
subsided
a
second
time
lookit
here
jake
piney
continued
to
the
sheriff
address
you
do
have
to
kick
my
wood
all
over
the
county
do
you
i
lookin
for
the
knife
explained
the
sheriff
ceasing
not
to
stub
his
toes
against
the
solid
chunks
feller
after
doing
a
thing
like
this
gets
flustrated
sometimes
and
drops
the
knife
and
finding
the
knife
might
be
a
help
in
locating
the
feller
all
of
which
seemed
sufficiently
logical
to
the
bystanders
racey
decided
he
had
seen
enough
besides
he
wanted
to
camp
closer
to
his
warbags
he
should
have
been
in
his
room
before
this
and
he
would
have
been
had
he
cared
to
make
himself
conspicuous
by
not
going
along
with
the
crowd
to
see
what
piney
jackson
had
found
declining
swing
earnest
invitation
to
drink
he
returned
to
the
hotel
swing
went
grouchily
to
the
happy
heart
wondering
what
was
the
matter
with
his
friend
it
was
not
like
the
racey
he
knew
to
play
the
hermit
once
in
his
room
racey
again
explored
his
own
and
swing
saddlebags
and
looked
under
the
cots
and
through
the
bedclothes
but
he
found
nothing
that
did
not
belong
to
either
himself
or
swing
they
did
make
a
second
trip
he
said
to
himself
i
betting
it
jack
harpe
shore
it
is
the
polecat
then
in
order
to
have
a
reason
for
remaining
in
the
room
he
pulled
off
his
boots
and
trousers
fished
a
housewife
from
a
and
set
about
repairing
a
rip
in
his
trousers
it
was
a
perfectly
good
rip
he
had
had
it
a
long
time
what
more
natural
that
on
this
particular
day
he
should
wish
to
sew
it
up
it
was
an
hour
later
that
he
heard
the
tramp
of
several
pairs
of
boots
on
the
stairs
he
could
hear
the
wheezing
laboured
breathing
of
bill
lainey
the
hotel
proprietor
climbing
the
stairs
always
bothered
bill
the
latter
and
his
followers
came
along
the
hall
and
stopped
in
front
of
racey
door
this
is
his
room
panted
bill
lainey
unceremoniously
the
latch
was
lifted
a
man
entered
the
man

jake

the
sheriff
of
fort
creek
county
he
was
followed
by
kansas
casey
his
deputy
jake
looked
serious
but
kansas
was
smiling
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
then
he
opened
it
quickly
and
thrust
his
head
into
the
hall
no
need
of
you
bill
he
said
aw

said
bill
aggrievedly
and
forthwith
shuffled
away
kansas
withdrew
his
head
and
nodded
to
jake
rule

gone
he
said
racey
dawson
sitting
crosslegged
on
his
cot
and
plying
his
needle
in
most
workmanlike
fashion
grinned
comfortably
at
the
two
officers
lord
how
glad
he
was
he
had
found
that
knife
if
he
had
sidown
gents

chuckled

some
formalities

declared
the
sheriff
seriously
i

thought

fixing
to
take

right
out
and
string
me
up
before

to
search

stuff
huh

it
swing
ai
here
but
i
give
you
permission
for
him
he
wo
mind
jake
and
kansas
went
at
the
warbags
like
terriers
digging
out
a
badger
racey
leaned
on
his
elbow
and
watched
them
what
luck
that
the
door
had
been
ajar
and
that
he
had
noticed
it
if
it
had
not
been
a
matter
he
would
have
laughed
aloud
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
the
officers
stood
up
they
had
gone
through
everything
in
the
room
including
the
cots
kansas
casey
wore
a
pleased
smile
jake
rule
looked
disappointed
do
look
so
glum
jake
urged
racey
is
it
a
fair
question
to
ask
what
yo
hunting
for
the
knife
he
said
shortly
the
knife
that
cut
bull
throat
the
knife
huh
remarked
racey
as
if
to
himself
so
suspectin
me
of
wiping
out
bull
are
you
i
never
did
said
kansas
promptly
i
know
you
you
ai
that
kind
jake
looked
reproachfully
at
his
deputy
you
never
can
tall
racey
he
said
turning
to
the
puncher
i
got
so
myself
i
do
trust
nobody
no
more
was
this
here
yore
own
idea
pursued
racey
or
did
somebody
sic
you
onto
me
jake
made
no
immediate
answer
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
of
two
minds
whether
to
speak
or
not
why
not
tell
him
suggested
kansas
what
the
odds
at
this
jake
took
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
vest
pocket
and
handed
it
to
racey
i
found
this
lying
on
the
floor
of
my
office
when
i
come
back
after
attending
to
bull
was
his
explanation
there
were
words
printed
on
the
slip
of
paper
they
read
look
in
racey
dawson
room
for
what
killed
bull
the
communication
was
unsigned
racey
handed
it
back
to
jake
rule
got
any
idea
who
put
it
in
yore
office
he
asked
jake
shook
his
head
i
dunno
he
said
the
window
was
open
anybody
passing
could
throwed
it
in
you
satisfied
now
jake
or
racey
did
not
complete
the
sentence
oh
i
satisfied
you
did
do
it
replied
the
sheriff
if
what
you
mean
but
the
man
who
wrote
this
here
as
he
spoke
he
tore
the
note
in
two
dropped
the
pieces
on
the
floor
and
stamped
out
of
the
room
kansas
casey
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
he
followed
in
the
wake
of
his
superior
he
saw
racey
dawson
picking
up
the
two
pieces
of
the
note
mouth
was
a
grim
uncompromising
line
if
racey
ever
finds
out
who
wrote
that
thought
kansas
to
himself
pulling
the
door
shut
hell
will
shore
pop
and
i
hope
it
does
for
he
liked
racey
dawson
did
kansas
casey
the
deputy
sheriff
chapter
xv
fire
fire
why
did
you
tell
me
at
breakfast
demanded
swing
tunstall
and
give
it
away
to
jack
harpe
said
scornful
racey
shore
that
would
been
a
bright
thing
to
do
now
would
it
what
didja
do
with
the
knife
dropped
it
through
a
knothole
in
the
wall
the
only
way
they
ever
get
hold
of
it
is
by
tearing
the
building
down
jack
harpe
if
he
the
feller
will
know
you
found
it
and
try
again
shore
we
ca
help
that
one
thing
we
know
before
the
day
is
over
whether
it
is
jack
harpe
or
not
how
remember
me
this
morning
telling
you
how
i
left
my
out
all
night
and
then
going
out
in
the
corral
for
the
same
i
said
it
so
jack
could
hear
me
he
did
hear
me
and
he
watched
me
go
he
saw
me
go
out
round
the
corral
and
he
saw
me
come
back
without
the
now
anybody
know
i
would
leave
my
out
behind
the
corral
would
i
not
likely
but
a
feller
who
just
found
a
knife
with
blood
on
it
in
his
warbags
might
go
out
back
of
the
corral
to
lose
the
knife
might
he
he
might
well
that
what
i
did
naturally
having
already
lost
the
knife
down
through
the
knothole
i
could
lose
her
again
but
i
did
the
best
i
could
i
dug
in
the
ground
with
a
sharp
stick
and
i
made
a
hole
like
and
i
filled
her
in
again
and
tramped
her
all
down
flat
and
sort
of
half
smoothed
down
the
ground
like
i
was
trying
to
hide
my
tracks
and
what
i
been
doing
then
i
came
away
now
i
betting
that
if
jack
harpe
is
the
lad
tucked
away
that
knife
in
my
warbags
he
go
skirmishing
out
behind
the
corral
to
see
what
i
was
really
doing
maybe
doubtfully
there
ai
any
maybe
if
he
the
man
turned
the
trick
and
from
where
we
under
this
wagon
we
can
see
the
back
of
the
corral
plain
as
there
he
comes
now
the
posts
of
the
corral
were
less
than
a
hundred
yards
from
where
racey
and
swing
lay
beneath
a
freight
wagon
from
the
wagon
which
was
standing
beyond
the
stage
company
corral
the
ground
sloped
gently
to
the
hotel
corral
racey
had
taken
the
precaution
to
mask
their
position
with
a
cedar
bush
hatless
he
peered
through
the
branches
at
the
man
quartering
the
ground
behind
the
hotel
corral
he
getting
close
to
where
i
made
that
hole
he
told
swing
now
he
found
it
he
resumed
as
the
man
dropped
on
his
knees
jack
harpe
all
along
ai
he
the
humoursome
codger
he
shore
could
dug
up
that
hole
already
declared
swing
when
jack
harpe
jumped
to
his
feet
after
a
sojourn
on
his
knees
of
possibly
thirty
seconds
duration
no
assented
racey
puzzled
he
could
there
an
odd
number
he
added
as
jack
harpe
pelted
back
at
a
brisk
trot
over
the
way
he
had
come
le
not
go
just
yet
swing
i
have
a
feeling
he
was
glad
of
this
feeling
when
ten
minutes
later
jack
harpe
returned
with
jake
rule
and
kansas
casey
the
latter
carried
a
shovel
the
three
men
clustered
round
the
spot
where
racey
had
dug
his
hole
kansas
casey
set
his
foot
on
the
shovel
and
drove
it
into
the
ground
racey
chuckled
at
the
pleasant
sight
what
must
inevitably
follow
would
be
even
pleasanter
the
deputy
sheriff
made
the
dirt
fly
for
six
minutes
then
he
threw
down
the
shovel
pushed
back
his
hat
and
wiped
his
face
on
his
sleeve
he
spoke
but
his
language
was
unintelligible
jack
harpe
said
something
and
picked
up
the
shovel
he
began
to
dig
he
cast
the
earth
about
for
possibly
five
minutes
ai
he
the
huh
racey
demanded
jabbing
his
comrade
in
the
ribs
with
stiffened
thumb
just
watch
him
scratch
gravel
suddenly
jake
rule
and
kansas
casey
turned
their
backs
on
the
frantically
labouring
jack
harpe
and
walked
away
jack
harpe
watched
them
threw
up
a
few
more
shovelfuls
and
then
slammed
the
implement
to
earth
with
a
clatter
hitched
up
his
pants
and
strode
hurriedly
after
the
officers
that
proves
it
i
guess
said
swing
naturally
she
enough
for
us
it
to
whatsa
matter
inquired
swing
surprised
at
his
friend
vehemence
whatsa
matter
whatsa
matter
everythin
the
matter
i
just
happened
to
think
that
now
bull
wo
be
able
to

he
was
going
to
ca
you

the
girl

the
kind
that

she
wo
bull

my
one
best
bet
what
that
cried
swing
raising
himself
on
an
elbow
that
was
the
noise
of
a
tumult
in
farewell
main
street
there
were
shouts
and
yells
and
screams
above
all
screams
racey
and
swing
hurried
to
the
street
when
they
reached
it
the
shouts
and
yells
had
subsided
but
the
screams
had
not
if
anything
they
were
louder
than
before
they
issued
from
the
mouth
of
marie
whom
jake
rule
kansas
casey
and
four
other
men
were
taking
to
the
calaboose
they
were
doing
their
duty
as
gently
as
possible
and
marie
was
making
it
as
difficult
for
them
as
possible
she
was
as
mad
as
a
teased
rattlesnake
and
not
a
man
of
her
six
captors
but
bore
the
marks
of
fingernails
or
teeth
or
heels
she
had
it
appeared
attacked
without
warning
and
with
a
derringer
jack
harpe
as
he
was
walking
peacefully
along
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
starlight
only
by
good
luck
and
a
loose
board
that
had
turned
under
the
girl
foot
as
she
fired
had
harpe
been
preserved
from
sudden
death
that
shore
tough
racey
said
to
their
informant

a
hammer
and
some
nails
and

that
loose
board

cautioned
the
other
if
you
want
something
to
do
suppose
now

tell
him
was
instant
suggestion
racey
tone
was
light
but
his
stare
was
hard
the
other

young
sam

bouncing
out
of

jumping
up

down
in

of

along
the
sidewalk
together
afire

racey
lookit
the
smoke

through

window
at
the
corner

smoke
was
followed
by
a
vicious
lash
of
flame
that
whipped
up
the
side
of
the
building
and
set
the
eaves
alight
the
glass
of
another
window
fell
through
the
bars
with
a
tinkle
a
billow
of
smoke
rushed
forth

seeping
through
cracks
at
the
back
of

having
picked
up
a
handy
axe
raced
round
to
the
back
only
to
find
the
deputy
unlocking
the
back
door
a
burst
of
smoke
as
he
flung
open

the
trouble
and
its
cause
on
being
told
he
convened
court
on
the
spot
judge
dolan
agreed
with
mike
flynn
that
the
burning
of
the
jail
was
a
trivial
matter
requiring
no
official
attention
for
was
not
dolan
a
carpenter
and
would
undoubtedly
be
given
the
contract
for
a
new
jail
quite
so
you
ca
prove
anything
about
this
he
told
jake
rule
and
the
assembled
multitude
but
this
assault
on
jack
harpe
is
a
cat
with
another
tail
it
was
a
lawless
act
and
had
oughta
happened
marie
yo
a
citizen
of
farewell
and
you
oughta
take
an
interest
in
the
community
instead
of
surging
out
and
trying
to
massacre
a
visitor
in
our
midst
a
visitor
who
figuring
on
settlin
hereabouts
i
understand
gawd
knows
we
need
all
the
inhabitants
we
can
get
and
it
just
such
tricks
as
yores
marie
that
discourages
immigration
here
judge
dolan
frowned
upon
marie
and
thumped
the
palm
of
his
hand
with
a
bony
fist
marie
stood
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
and
hung
her
head
down
since
her
raving
outburst
at
the
time
of
her
arrest
she
had
cooled
considerably
it
was
evident
that
she
was
now
trying
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
business
marie
resumed
judge
dolan
and
cleared
his
throat
importantly
why
did
you
shoot
at
jack
harpe
he
insulted
me
marie
replied
without
a
quiver
i
ai
ever
said
a
word
to
her
countered
jack
harpe
i
do
even
know
the
girl
the
judge
turned
back
to
marie
have
you
any
witnesses
to
this
insult
he
queried
nary
a
witness
marie
shook
her
brown
head

she
yore
word
against
his
where
did
this
insult
take
place
at
my
shack

early
this
mornin
that
a
lie
boomed
jack
harpe
which
will
be
about
all
from

snapped
judge
dolan
vigorously
pounding
his
palm
what
did
he
say
to
you
was
the
judge
next
question
i

protested
jack
harpe
she
says

leave
her
alone
public
opinion
which
at
first
had
rather
favoured
jack
harpe
now
frowned
upon
him
he
should
have
insulted
the
girl
no
sir
he
had
no
business
doing
that
be
a
good
thing
if
he
was
arrested
for
it
perhaps
what
a
virtuous
thing
is
public
opinion

a
nickel

said
marie

it
was
a
few
minutes
after
he
had
eaten
dinner
that
racey
dawson
presented
himself
at
the
door
of
kansas
casey
shack
the
door
was
open
racey
stood
in
the
doorway
and
leaned
the
shovel
against
the
wall
of
the
room
you
forgot
yore
shovel
kansas
he
said
gently
or
jack
harpe
did
same
thing
and
here
it
is
kansas

the
grace
to
look
a
trifle
shamefaced
somebody
said
buried
that
knife
he
began
and
stopped
yep
i
know
jack
harpe
smiled
racey
bright
eyes

i
would
bank
too
strong
on
what
he
says
about
me
i
ai
denied
the
deputy
another
thing
kansas
drawled
racey
did
you
ever
stop
to
think
how
come
he
knowed
so
much
about
that
knife
and
did
you
ask
him
if
he
was
the
gent
left
that
paper
in
jake
office
and
going
on
from
that
did
you
ask
him
why
he
did
come
out
flat
footed
at
first
and
say
what
he
thought
he
knowed
instead
of
waiting
till
after
you
searched
my
room
you
do
have
to
answer
kansas
only
if
i
was
you
i
think
it
over
i
think
it
over
plenty
so
long
from
the
house
of
casey
he
went
to
the
shack
of
marie
he
found
the
girl
cooking
her
dinner
quite
as
if
attempts
at
murder
dead
men
and
jailburning
were
matters
of
small
moment
but
if
her
manner
was
placid
her
eyes
were
not
they
were
bright
and
hard
and
they
flickered
stormily
upon
him
when
she
lifted
her
gaze
from
the
pan
of
frying
potatoes
and
saw
who
it
was
standing
in
the
doorway
i
obliged
to
you

said
calmly

reproachfully
he
shifted
his
weight
from
one
uncomfortable
foot
to
the
other
i
did
come
here
about
the
fine
he
told
her
i
he
stopped
uncertain
whether
to
continue
or
not
if
you
did
come
about
the
fine
it
must
be
something
else
important
said
she
insultingly
i
shore

be
set
up
i
suppose
so
far
it
always

me
that

moves
she
mimicked

nothin

an
set
take
a
chair
that
one
what
do
you
want
down
feller
down
the
command
was
called
forth
by
the
violent
entry
of
the
yellow
dog
which
remembering
racey
as
a
friend
flung
itself
upon
him
with
whines
and
he
all
right
said
racey
rubbing
the
rough
head
i
just
thought
i
ask
you

about

marie
narrowed

turned
dark
with
suspicion
whadda

about

she
demanded
not
as
much
as
i
like
to

was
his
frank
reply
i
ai

he
began
wheedlingly
she
shook
her
head
at
him

pull
up
a
chair
dinner
most
ready
they
enough
for
two
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
just
dined
at
the
hotel
he
accepted
her
invitation
in
the
hope
that
she
could
be
persuaded
to
talk
and
after
dinner
he
smoked
several
cigarettes
with
her
still
hoping
finally
finding
that
nothing
he
could
say
was
of
any
avail
to
move
her
he
took
up
his
hat
and
departed
do
go
away
mad
she
called
after
him
i
ai
he
denied
and
went
on
her
mocking
laughter
ringing
in
his
ears
after
racey
was
gone
out
of
sight
marie
turned
back
into
her
little
house
there
was
no
laughter
on
her
lips
or
in
her
eyes
as
she
sat
down
in
a
chair
beside
the
table
and
stared
across
it
at
the
chair
in
which
racey
had
been
sitting
he
a
nice
boy
she
whispered
under
her
breath
after
a
time
i
wish
i
wish
but
what
it
was
she
wished
it
is
impossible
to
relate
for
instead
of
completing
the
sentence
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
began
to
cry
early
next
morning
racey
dawson
and
swing
tunstall
rode
out
of
town
by
the
marysville
trail
they
were
bound
for
the
bar
s
and
a
job
what
have
you
been
drinkin
racey
demanded
saltoun
winking
at
his
and
foreman
tom
loudon
the
latter
did
not
return
the
wink
he
kept
a
sober
gaze
fastened
on
racey
dawson
racey
was
staring
at
saltoun
his
eyes
began
to
narrow
meanin
he
drawled
now
do
go
crawlin
round
huntin
offense
where
none
meant
advised
saltoun
but
you
know
how
it
is
yoreself
racey
any
gent
who
gets
so
full
he
ca
pick
out
his
own
hoss
and
goes
weaving
off
on
somebody
else
is
liable
to
make
mistakes
other
ways
you
got
ta
admit
it
possible
the
slight
tinge
of
red
underlying
racey
heavy
coat
of
tan
acknowledged
the
corn
it
possible
he
admitted
saltoun
saw
his
advantage
and
seized
it
now
this
is
another
mistake
tell
you
what
i
do
said
racey
you
said
you
had
jobs
for
a
couple
of
handsome
young
fellers
like
us
aw
right
we
go
to
work
we
ride
for
you
six
months
for
nothing
huh
saltoun
and
tom
loudon
stared
their
astonishment
oh
the
cat
got
more
of
a
tail
than
that
said
racey
you
pay
us
a
nickel
for
those
six
months
what
i
said
will
happen
do
happen
if
it
does
happen
like
i
say
you
pay
each
of
us
two
hundred
large
round
simoleons
per
each
and
every
month

again
said
saltoun
wrinkling
his
forehead
racey
came
again
as
requested
six
months
is
a
long
time
frowned
saltoun
if
i
lose
but
i
dunno
what
i
talkin
about
pointed
out
racey
i
make
mistakes
you
know
that
and
you
were
so
shore
nothin
was
gon
na
happen
are
you
still
shore
well
hesitated
saltoun
if
you
take
us
up
you
stand
to
be
in
the
wages
of
two
punchers
for
six
months
that
four
hundred
and
eighty
dollars
almost
five
hundred
dollars
of

know
but
yo
so
shore
she
gon
na
keep
on
like
always
that
i
oughta
have
odds
five
to

mused
saltoun
pulling
at
the
ends
of
his
gray
mustache
and
fair
enough
seeing
that
nothing
is
going
to
happen
i
would
do
it
put
in
tom
loudon
these
trick
bets
are
unlucky
oh
i
dunno
said
saltoun
running
true
to
form
in
that
he
rarely
took
kindly
to
advice
looks
like
a
good
chance
to
get
six
months
work
out
of
two
men
for
nothing
looks
like
a
good
chance
to
lose
hundred
dollars
exclaimed
tom
loudon
wrathfully
my
gawd
tom
said
saltoun
cocking
a
grizzled
eyebrow

bet

shook
a
whimsical
head
at
racey
dawson

not
to
adjust
his
necktie
the
mirror
was
small
and
he
was
not
and
it
was
only
by
dint
of
much
wriggling
that
he
was
succeeding
in
his
purpose
to
jimmie
and
his
question
he
paid
absolutely
no
attention

all
up
like

jimmie
continued
with
enthusiasm
addressing
the
world
at
large
i
can
remember
when
racey
used
to
ride
for
the
and
the
how
he
was
a
regular
human
being
a
handkerchief
round
his
neck
was
good
enough
for
him
if
his
pants
had
a
rip
in
anywheres
or
they
was
buttons
off
his
vest
or
his
shirt
was
tore

the
buttons
on

for
the
moment

and
hooked

against

and
spat
accurately
through
a
knothole
in
the
bunkhouse
floor
yop
he
went
on
ramming
his
quid
into
the
angle
of
his
jaw
and
he
always
admiring
himself
in
the
mirror
racey
is
he
pats
his
hair
down
after
partin
it
and
usin
enough
on
it
to
keep
forty
guns
from

for
ten
years

shines

beat
the
long
roll
with
his
knuckles
on
the
bottom
of
the
and
winked
at
the
broad

there
some
people

the

of

something
about

not
by
severial
jugfuls
i
he
broke

cocking
a
listening
ear
yeah
grinned
racey
you

a
noise
in
the
huh
i
i
saw
the
kid
slide
past
in
the
while

standing
in
the
doorway
and
you
never
told
me
squalled
jimmie
speeding
toward
his
beloved
place
of
business
he
reached
it
rather
late
when
he
entered
by
the
doorway
the
kid
a
pie
in
each
hand
was
disappearing
through
a
back
window
did
you
ever
get
left
tossed
back
the
kid
as
the
flung
buzzed
past
his
now
see
what
you
done
he
continued
skipping
safely
out
of
range
dented
yore
nice
new
frypan
all
up

done
that
jimmie
cost
money
some
day
if

the
old

declared
jimmie
leaning
over

and
shaking
an
indignant
fist
at
the
kid

hear
they

the
brisk
answer

time

began
the
angry
jimmie
but
you
ai
gon
na

me
tantalized
the
kid
racey
hurry
up
racey
came
slowly
and
with
dignity
the
kid
stared
well
i
bedam
where
are
you
goin
ride
just
a
ride
was
the
vague
reply
is
that
all
i
thought
it

a
funeral
or
a
wedding
or
something
an
i
was
wonderin
just
a
ride
huh
and
where
might
you
be
to
ride
to
if
i
may
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
you
can
ask
of
course
replied
racey
shrugging
his
wide
shoulders
and
spreading
his
hands
after
the
fashion
of
telescope
laguerre
but
that
ai
sayin
he
tell
you
put
in
jimmie
bet
you
gon
na
go
see
that
new
hasher
of
bill
lainey
no
denied
the
kid
judicially
not
that
lady
even
racey
arms
ai
long
enough
to
reach
round
her
i
one
of
these
pies
is
a
pie
you
can
gim
me
that
one
suggested
racey
dawson
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
change
the
subject
the
kid
his
teeth
sunk
in
the
raisin
pie
shook
a
decisive
head
and
mumbled
unintelligibly
he
thrust
the
other
pie
toward
his
friend
racey
dawson
rode
away
westward
munching
pie
and
it
was
a
very
good
pie
and
would
have
brought
credit
to
any
cook
he
regretfully
ate
the
last
crumb
and
rolled
a
cigarette
he
felt
fairly
full
and
at
utter
peace
with
the
world
why
not
was
it
a
good
old
world
and
a
mighty
friendly
world
despite
the
harpes
and
tweezys
and
joneses
that
infested
it
i
should
say
so
racey
dawson
inhaled
luxuriously
pushed
back
his
wide
hat
and
let
the
breeze
ruffle
his
brown
hair
he
rubbed
the
back
of
one
hand
across
his
straight
eyebrows
and
stared
across
the
range
toward
the
distant
hills
that
marked
his
goal
which
goal
was
the
old
c
y
at
moccasin
spring
on
soogan
creek
where
lived
the
dales
and
their
daughter
molly
and
as
he
looked
at
the
hill
and
bethought
him
of
what
lay
beyond
it
he
drew
a
winchester
from
the
scabbard
under
his
left
leg
and
made
sure
that
he
had
not
forgotten
to
load
it
for
racey
laboured
under
no
delusion
as
to
the
danger
that
menaced
not
only
his
own
existence
but
that
of
his
friend
swing
he
knew
that
their
lives
hung
by
a
thread
and
a
thin
thread
at
that
they
were
but
two
against
many
and
their
position
had
not
been
aided
by
the
string
of
uneventful
days
succeeding
their
advent
at
the
bar
for
their
enemies
were
taking
their
time
in
the
launching
of
their
enterprise
and
racey
had
not
expected
this
it
threw
him
off
his
balance
somewhat
certainly
it
worried
him
it
was
not
humanly
possible
that
jack
harpe
could
be
aware
that
old
man
saltoun
did
not
believe
what
racey
had
told
him
but
he
was
acting
as
if
he
knew
perhaps
he
was
waiting
till
nebraska
jones
should
be
entirely
well
of
his
wound
that
was
possible
but
not
probable
jack
harpe
had
not
impressed
racey
as
a
man
who
would
allow
his
plans
to
be
indefinitely
held
up
for
such
a
cause
there
was
no
telling
when
nebraska
would
be
up
and
about
his
recovery
thanks
to
past
dissipations
had
been
exceedingly
slow
again
perhaps
the
delay
might
be
merely
a
detail
of
the
plan
fat
jakey
pooley
mentioned
in
his
letter
to
luke
tweezy
or
it
might
be
due
to
the
care
the
dales
and
morgans
were
taking
of
old
dale
wherever
the
old
gentleman
went
some
one
of
his
relations
went
with
him
certainly
no
had
been
able
to
approach
dale
since
his
spree
at
mcfluke
at
any
time
dale
to
all
intents
and
purposes
was
impossible
to
isolate
at
any
rate
whatever
the
reason
the
fact
remained
that
harpe
had
not
moved
and
showed
no
signs
of
moving
saltoun
every
time
he
met
racey
took
special
pains
to
ask
his
puncher
how
much
twice
six
times
two
hundred
was
then
saltoun
without
waiting
for
an
answer
would
walk
off
slapping
his
leg
and
cackling
with
laughter
even
tom
london
was
beginning
to
take
the
view
that
perhaps
his
was
in
the
right
after
all
you
been
here
near
two
months
now
racey
he
had
said
that
very
morning
and
they
ai
anything
happened
yet
i
got
four
months
to
go
racey
had
replied
with
a
placidity
he
did
not
feel
now
as
he
rode
his
eyes
closely
scanning
the
various
places
in
the
landscape
providing
good
cover
for
possible
bushwhackers
he
recalled
what
loudon
had
said
i
show
him
all
the
happenstances
he
wants
to
see
before
through
he
said
aloud
something
gon
na
happen
something
got
to
happen
jack
harpe
wo
let
this
slide
not
by
a
jugful
the
words
were
confident
enough
but
they
were
words
that
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
repeating
to
himself
nearly
every
day
for
some
time
perhaps
they
had
lost
some
of
their
force
perhaps
twelve
hundred
dollars
mused
racey
and
the
same
for
swing
six
months
work
for
hell
it
ca
turn
out
different
i
know
it
ca
we
show
all
yet
wo
we
cuter
old
settler
cuter
old
settler
waggled
his
ears
he
was
a
companionable
horse
never
kicked
human
beings
and
bucked
but
seldom
yep
continued
racey
sitting
back
against
the
cantle
she
a
long
creek
that
do
bend
or
other
and
then
the
creek
that
was
his
flow
of
thought
shot
round
a
bend
into
the
broad
and
sparkling
reaches
of
a
much
pleasanter
subject
than
the
one
that
had
to
do
with
harpes
and
tweezys
and
joneses
after
a
time
he
came
to
where
the
pleasanter
subject
on
her
knees
was
weeding
among
the
flowers
that
grew
tidily
round
moccasin
spring
low
and
lovely
cuddled
down
between
tall
columbines
and
orange
side
by
side
with
the
pink
geranium
of
gardens
the
wild
geranium
nodded
its
lavender
blooms
in
perfect
harmony
the
subject
molly
dale
rested
the
point
of
her
between
two
rows
of
ragged
sailors
and
and
lifted
a
pair
of
the
clearest
softest
blue
eyes
in
the
world
in
greeting
to
racey
dawson
this
is
a
fine
time
for
you
to
be
traipsing
in
she
told
him
with
a
smile
that
revealed
a
deep
dimple
in
each
cheek
i
thought
you
promised
to
help
me
weed
my
garden
i
did
he
returned
humbly
dismounting
and
sliding
the
reins
over
cuter
neck
and
head
but
you
know
how
it
is
sunday
mornin
molly
there
a
lot
to
do
round
the
ranch
sometimes
now
this
mornin
i
bet
she
interrupted
smoothing
out
the
smile
and
frowning
as
severely
as
she
was
able
i
just
tell
a
man
that
i
would
i
would
indeed
i
sure
it
must
have
taken
you
at
least
to
shine
those
boots
more
likely
an
hour
why
i
can
see
my
face
in
them
and
a
very
pretty
face
too
said
racey
rising
to
the
occasion
if
i
owned
that
face
i
never
stop
looking
at
it
myself
i
mean
he
floundered
aghast
at
his
own
temerity
but
the
lady
smiled
that
do
she
cautioned
him
do
try
to
flirt
with
me
i
wo
have
it
i
ai
he
began
and
stopped
molly
dale
continued
to
look
at
him
inquiringly
but
as
he
gave
no
evidence
of
completing
the
sentence
she
lowered
her
gaze
and
resumed
her
weeding
racey
thought
to
have
glimpsed
a
disappointed
look
in
her
eyes
as
she
dropped
her
chin
but
he
could
not
be
certain
probably
he
had
been
mistaken
why
should
she
be
disappointed
why
indeed
start
in
on
that
bed
racey
she
directed
nodding
her
head
toward
the
columbines
and
there
some
of
that
miserable
pusley
inching
in
on
the
and
they
such
tiny
things
it
does
take
much
to
kill
them
and
lord
knows
i
had
a
hard
enough
job
persuading
to
grow
in
the
first
place
wild
things
never
cotton
to
living
inside
a
fence
he
told
her
they
like
injuns
thataway
put
in
a
house
and
they
do
do
so
well
shucks
look
at
the
rainbow
there
the
difference
and
besides
the
rainbow
lived
in
a
house
since
she
left
the
convent
she
lives
in
a
tepee
same
as
her
uncle
and
aunties
i
do
care
defended
molly
straightening
on
her
knees
to
survey
her
garden
every
single
plant
in
my
garden
except
the
pink
geraniums
is
wild
look
at
those
bushes
round
the
spring
and
the
blue
camass
along
the
brook
and
the
squaw
bushes
round
the
house
and
the
squaw
grass
and
pussy
paws
back
of
the
some
i
transplanted
the
rest
i
grew
from
seeds
and
where
will
you
find
a
garden
racey
sagged
back
on
his
heels
and
stared
critically
about
him
yeah
he
drawled
nodding
a
slow
head
they
do
look
pretty
good
got
to
give
you
lots
of
credit
but
those
squaw
bushes
now
he
broke
off
grinning
oh
of
course
you
provoking
thing
cried
she
irately
might
know
you
pick
on
those
squaw
bushes
it
is
a
mite
too
shady
for
where
they
are
but
still
they
doing
pretty
well
considering
satisfied
what
that
that
was
a
horseman
appearing
suddenly
among
the
cottonwoods
that
belted
with
a
scattering
grove
the
garden
and
the
spring
the
horseman
was
lanpher
manager
of
the
ranch
he
was
followed
by
another
rider
a
lean
swarthy
individual
with
a
saturnine
face
racey
knew
the
latter
by
sight
and
reputation
the
man
was
one
skeel
and
rejoiced
in
the
of
alicran
the
furtive
scorpion
whose
sting
is
death
is
not
indigenous
to
the
territory
but
skeel
had
gained
the
appellation
in
new
mexico
a
region
where
the
insect
may
be
found
and
when
the
man
left
the
border
for
the
border
good
the
name
left
with
him
oh
lookout
the
bushes
the
bushes
do
trample
my
but
lanpher
heeding
not
at
all
molly
cries
of
warning
spurred
his
sweating
horse
through
the
growth
breaking
down
three
shrubs
and
splashed
across
the
spring
the
brook
and
several
rows
of
flowers
the
garden
looked
as
if
a
miniature
cyclone
had
passed
that
way
midway
across
the
garden
lanpher
horse
halted
halted
because
a
flying
figure
in
chaps
had
appeared
from
nowhere
and
seized
it
by
the
rein
but
the
horse
did
more
than
halt
in
obedience
to
a
powerful
jerk
administered
by
the
man
in
chaps
the
horse
pivoted
on
its
forelegs
and
slid
its
rider
out
of
the
saddle
and
deposited
him
and
face
downward
among
the
flowers
lanpher
arose
snarling
to
face
a
levelled
sixshooter
it
did
not
signify
that
racey
had
not
drawn
the
weapon
he
was
perfectly
capable
of
shooting
through
the
bottom
of
his
holster
and
lanpher
knew
it
and
racey
knew
that
he
knew
it
get
out
of
this
garden
ordered
racey
take
yore
friend
with
you
he
added
tossing
the
horse
bridle
to
lanpher
and
if
i
were
you
i
walk
a
heap
careful
between
the
rows
i
just
would
go
any
more
of
these
posies
lanpher
went
he
went
carefully
he
was
followed
quite
as
carefully
by
racey
dawson
when
lanpher
was
free
of
the
neat
rows
he
looked
up
venomously
into
the
face
of
alicran
skeel
who
had
meticulously
ridden
round
the
garden
i
was
wondering
where
you
was
lanpher
remarked
with
deep
meaning
i
ai
rooting
up
nobody
gyarden
alicran
returned
cheerfully
and
do
wonder
too
hard
might
strain
yore
intellect
or
something
i
always
be
where
i
aim
to
be
always
you
done
scratched
yore
face
lanpher
lanpher
turned
from
alicran
skeel
and
spat
upon
the
ground
alicran
said
racey
holding
his
alert
attitude
the
first
false
move
you
make
lanpher
gets
it
i
ai
makin
a
move
said
alicran
thumbs
hooked
in
the
armholes
of
his
vest
i
got
plenty
to
do
minding
my
own
business
huh
thus
the
sceptical
racey
who
did
not
trust
skeel
as
far
as
he
could
throw
a
horse
by
the
tail
shucks
said
alicran
out
of
deference
to
the
lady
you
believe
me
shore
i
do
asserted
racey
shore
you
bet
you
i
i
can
talk
to
somebody
else
and
watch
you
at
the
same
time
if
alicran
was
worth
a
began
lanpher
furiously
and
stopped
you
was
gon
na
say
what
queried
alicran
softly
nothing
said
lanpher
sulkily
put
yore
gun
away
he
continued
to
racey
i
ai
gon
na
hurt
you
now
that
what
i
call
downright
generous
of
you
lanpher
racey
declared
warmly
i
shore
hate
to
be
hurt
i
shore
would
but
if
it
alla
same
to
you
i
keep
my
gun
right
where
she
is
if
alla
same
to
you
that
do
racey
stop
this
rowing
i
wo
have
it
it
was
molly
dale
pushing
past
racey
and
standing
with
arms
akimbo
directly
in
front
of
his
racey
let
his
gun
and
holster
fall
but
he
did
not
remove
his
hand
from
the
gunbutt
who
do
you
want
here
molly
inquired
of
lanpher
lanpher
features
cracked
into
an
ugly
smile
is
yore
paw
home
he
asked
father
gone
to
marysville
when
he
be
back
day
after
i
guess
yeah
i
kind
of
guess
he
want
to
spend
the
night
so
he
could
do
business
in
the
morning
huh
the
lanpher
smile
grew
even
uglier
he
has
some
business
to
attend
to
in
the
morning
yes
i
kind
of
thought
he
would
yeah
you
do
happen
to
know
the
nature
of
his
business
do
you
his
business
is
none
of
yours
and
i
thank
you
to
pick
up
your
feet
and
clear
out
the
pair
of
you
not
so
fast
lanpher
spread
deprecatory
hands
and
his
smile
became
suddenly
crooked
i
just
come
down
to
do
yore
paw
a
favour
a
favour
you
blank
unbelief
was
patent
in
molly
tone
and
expression
a
favour
me
you
see
yore
paw
got
a
mortgage
coming
due
on
the
tenth
and
the
reason
yore
paw
went
to
marysville
was
so
he
could
be
there
bright
and
early
morning
at
the
bank
to
renew
the
mortgage
ai
i
right
you
might
be
molly
face
was
now
a
mask
of
indifference
but
there
was
no
indifference
in
her
heart
there
was
cold
fear
racey
expression
was
likewise
indifferent
but
there
was
no
fear
in
his
heart
there
was
anger
cold
anger
for
he
had
sensed
what
was
coming
he
knew
that
the
previous
winter
had
been
a
hard
one
on
the
dale
fortunes
they
had
lost
most
of
their
little
bunch
of
cattle
in
a
blizzard
and
the
roof
of
their
stable
had
collapsed
killing
two
team
horses
and
a
riding
pony
racey
had
conjectured
that
dale
would
have
been
forced
to
borrow
on
mortgage
to
make
a
fresh
start
in
the
spring
and
at
that
time
in
the
territory
the
legal
rate
was
per
cent
stiff
to
be
sure
but
the
security
in
those
days
was
never
cattle
were
prone
to
die
at
inconvenient
moments
and
land
was
not
worth
what
it
was
east
of
the
mississippi
we
take
it
i
right
pursued
lanpher
lapping
his
tongue
round
the
words
as
though
they
possessed
taste
and
that
taste
pleasant
and
being
that
i
right
i
say
yore
paw
could
saved
himself
the
ride
to
marysville
by
stayin
to
home
oh
lanpher
was
the
sort
of
man
who
as
a
boy
was
accustomed
to
thoroughly
enjoy
the
pastime
of
pulling
wings
from
living
flies
and
drowning
a
helpless
kitten
by
inches
now
he
nodded
his
head
and
grinned
anew
and
put
up
a
satisfied
hand
and
rubbed
his
stubbly
chin
racey
yearned
to
kick
him
it
was
shameful
that
molly
should
be
compelled
to
bandy
words
with
this
reptile
racey
stepped
forward
determinedly
and
slid
past
molly
promptly
she
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
do
mix
in
racey
she
commanded
with
set
face
it
all
right
it
all
right
i
tell
you
it
all
right
lanpher
hastened
to
say
more
than
a
hint
of
worriment
in
his
little
black
eyes
one
could
never
be
sure
of
these
bar
s
boys
they
were
uncertain
propositions
every
measly
one
of
them
shore
it
all
right
went
on
the
manager
i
ai
meaning
no
harm
yo
taking
a
lot
for
granted
racey
a
whole
lot
for
granted
nemmine
what
i
taking
for
granted
flung
back
racey
i
get
along
with
taking
only
what
mine
anyway
which
was
equivalent
to
saying
that
lanpher
was
a
thief
but
lanpher
overlooked
the
poorly
veiled
insult
and
switched
his
gaze
to
molly
dale
i
just
rid
over
to
say
he
told
her
that
if
yore
paw
is
still
set
on
renewing
the
mortgage
when
he
comes
back
from
marysville
he
have
to
see
me
and
luke
tweezy
at
the
we
done
bought
that
mortgage
from
the
bank
molly
dale
said
nothing
racey
felt
that
if
he
held
his
tongue
another
second
he
would
incontinently
burst
he
sidestepped
past
the
girl
you
said
yore
piece
he
told
lanpher
and
for
a
feller
who
was
bellyaching
so
loud
about
keeping
out
of
this
deal
it
strikes
me
yo
in
good
and
deep
buying
up
mortgages
and

out
he
flicked
a
thumb
westward
and
stared
at
lanpher
with
bright
eyes
lanpher
eyes
dropped
lifted
then
veered
toward
alicran
skeel
that
appreciative
observer
who
continued
to
sit
his
horse
as
good
as
gold
and
silent
as
a
clam
lanpher
turned
to
his
horse
without
another
word
slid
the
reins
over
the
animal
neck
and
crossed
them
slackly
he
stuck
toe
in
stirrup
and
swung
up
he
looked
down
at
molly
where
she
stood
dumbly
her
troubled
eyes
gazing
at
nothing
and
the
fingers
of
one
hand
slowly
plaiting
and
unplaiting
a
corner
of
her
apron
lanpher
opened
his
mouth
as
if
to
speak
but
no
words
issued
for
racey
had
coughed
a
peremptory
cough
lanpher
turned
his
horse
head
toward
the
creek
lookit
here
alicran
the
peevish
lanpher
burst
forth
when
he
and
his
henchman
had
forded
the
creek
and
were
riding
westward

you

i
beginnin

began
lanpher
threateningly
alicran
skeel
turned
a
grim
face
on
his
employer
so
suddenly
and
sharply
that
lanpher
almost
dodged
lookit

lanpher
said
he
quietly

this
was
rubbing

in
lanpher
plucked
at
the
loose
strings
of
his
courage
and
managed
to
draw
out
a
faintly
responsive
twang
show
you
whether
i
got
guts
he
began
oh
look
said
alicran
see
that
wild
currant
bush
to
lanpher
it
seemed
that
the
sixshooter
was
barely
out
of
the
holster
before
it
was
back
again
but
there
was
a
swirl
of
smoke
adrift
in
the
windless
air
and
the
topmost
branch
of
a
wild
currant
bush
thirty
feet
distant
had
been
that
instant
cut
in
two
what
was
that
you
was
gon
na
say
alicran
prompted
softly
i
forget
evaded
lanpher
but
they
one
thing
you
wan
na
remember
alicran
it
do
pay
to
be
squeamish
it
comes
high
in
the
end
usually
you
find
if
you
keep
on
being
mushy
thisaway
that
have
more
you

swing
at
the
finish

that
so
you
leave

things
my
own
way
you

tell
you
if
i
knowed

a
damfool
do
you
know
that
in
anything
you
do
no
matter
what
they
no
profit
in
unnecessary
trimmings
most
always
it
the
extra
frills
on
a
feller
work
that
pushes
the
bridge
over
and
lands
him
underneath
with
everything
on
top
of
him
and
the
job
to
do
again
if
he
lucky
enough
to
be
livin
at
the
finish
and
yore
swashing
through
that
girl
gyarden
was
a
heap
unnecessary
it
was
a
close
squeak
you
was
drilled
by
racey
dawson
i
would
have
blamed
him
if
he
had
let
a
little
light
in
on
yore
darkened
soul
done
it
myself
in
his
place
and
yore
rubbing
in
that
mortgage
deal
was
another
unnecessary
piece
o
damfoolishness
it
only
made
racey
have
it
in
for
you
more
ever
and
after
acting
like
more
kinds
of
a
fool
thataway
in
less
time
than
anybody
i
ever
see
before
you
sit
up
on
yore
hunkers
and
tell
i
have
more
i
can
swing
at
the
finish
say
you
make
me
laugh
listen
lanpher
for
a
feller
that
come
out
second
best
with
the
bar
s
outfit
as
many
times
as
you
have
it
looks
to
me
like
you
was
crowdin
providence
a
heap
close
that
all
right
sulked
lanpher
then
added
with
a
sudden
flare
of
spite
when
i
hired
you
as
foreman
i
shore
never
expected
to
draw
a
skypilot
full
o
sermons
into
the
bargain
no
drawled
alicran
looking
hard
at
lanpher
i
often
wonder
just
what
you
did
hire
me
for
on
which
lanpher
made
no
comment
yeah
resumed
alicran
the
fish
having
failed
to
bite
i
often
wonder
about
that
was
it
a
foreman
you
wanted
or
a
gunman
and
what
did
racey
mean
about
jack
harpe
down
on
you
so
hard
huh
nothing
nothing
nothing
lanpher
replied
irritably
if
racey
did
mean
nothing
by
it
what
did
yore
eyes
flip
for
and
why
didja
shuffle
yore
feet
whatell
business
is
it
of
yores
burst
out
the
goaded
manager
none
alicran
replied
calmly
i
was
just
wondering
i
got
a
curiosity
to
know
why
thassall
then
hogtie
yore
curiosity
or
you
be
gettin
yore
time
i
free
to
admit
i
need
you
like
i
said
before
but
i
can
do
without
you
if
i
got
ta
that
just
where
yo
dead
wrong
alicran
promptly
contradicted
you
ca
do
without
me
lanpher
i
like
the
job
of
bein
yore
foreman
i
like
it
so
well
that
if
you
was
to
fire
me
i
dunno
what
i
would
do
you
know
lanpher
a
man
is
a
whole
lot
bigger
target
than
the
branch
of
a
wild
currant
bush
frankly
speculative
the
eyes
of
alicran
travelled
up
and
down
the
spare
frame
of
the
manager
which
gave
lanpher
furiously
to
think
as
it
were
why
said
he
forcing
a
smile
i
guess
we
understand
each
other
alicran
shore
we
do
said
alicran
cheerfully
and
do
you
forget
it
chapter
xvii
signed
paper
when
the
two
men
had
departed
molly
dale
continued
to
stand
where
she
was
for
a
space
and
stare
dumbly
at
nothing
racey
realizing
well
enough
that
her
world
had
crashed
to
pieces
about
her
wished
that
she
would
burst
into
tears
a
sobbing
woman
is
easily
comforted
it
is
simply
necessary
to
pet
her
and
keep
on
petting
her
till
her
grief
is
assuaged
but
this
hard
stillness
of
molly
dale
gave
racey
no
opening
he
could
but
gaze
at
her
uncomfortably
and
shift
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
that
was
a
dirty
trick
of
the
marysville
bank
thus
tentatively
it
is
doubtful
whether
molly
heard
him
poor
father
she
said
in
a
low
tone
lookit
here
molly
said
racey
struck
by
a
bright
idea
i
got
a
money
i
been
saving
i
i
want
you
should
take
it
molly
continued
to
stare
into
the
distance
i
got
some
money
he
began
again
thinking
that
molly
had
not
heard
but
she
turned
her
face
toward
him
at
that
and
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
shining
with
unshed
tears
racey
she
said
with
a
slight
catch
in
her
voice
and
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
racey
you
a
dear
good
boy
we
we
manage
somehow
i
tell
mother
abruptly
she
swung
away
and
left
him
he
watched
her
cross
the
garden
and
enter
the
kitchen
of
the
then
slowly
thoughtfully
he
set
to
work
repairing
as
best
he
could
the
ravages
left
in
the
garden
by
the
hoofs
of
lanpher
horse
came
then
swing
tunstall
on
a
paint
pony
and
was
moved
to
mirth
at
sight
of
racey
dawson
engaged
in
earthy
labour
see
the
flowers
mouthed
swing
tunstall
after
the
fashion
of
a
child
wrestling
with
the
first
reader
does
racey
like
yeth
crathy
them
ai
he
cute
there
all
same
hoptoad
and
away
only
he
now
he
stopped
workin
he
gettin
all
red
in
the
face
he
mad
at
swing
who
never
done
him
no
harm
nohow
whatsa
matter
racey
he
added
in
his
natural
voice
what
bit
you
on
the
ear
this
fine
an
summer
day
racey
looked
over
his
shoulder
toward
the
house
then
he
got
to
his
feet
and
strode
across
the
garden
to
where
swing
tunstall
sat
his
horse
swing
said
he
quietly
are
you
busy
just
now
swing
suspecting
a
catch
somewhere
stared
in
swift
suspicion
why
uh
no
was
his
cautious
reply
then
go
off
and
die
without
waiting
for
swing
possible
comment
racey
turned
his
back
on
his
friend
and
walked
unhurriedly
to
his
horse
cuter
swing
slouched
sidewise
in
the
saddle
and
watched
him
go
he
rolled
a
cigarette
lit
it
and
inhaled
luxuriously
and
all
without
removing
his
gaze
from
racey
back
he
watched
while
racey
flung
the
reins
crosswise
over
cuter
neck
mounted
and
rode
down
into
the
creek
when
he
saw
that
racey
after
allowing
cuter
to
drink
nearly
all
he
wanted
rode
on
across
the
creek
and
up
the
farther
bank
swing
brow
became
corrugated
with
a
puzzled
frown
he
means
business
muttered
swing
i
ai
seen
that
look
on
his
face
for
some
time
i
wonder
what
did
happen
this
morning
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
dwindling
westward
moving
object
that
was
racey
dawson
and
his
horse
he
smoked
his
cigarette
to
a
butt
then
he
picked
up
his
reins
found
his
stirrups
and
rode
away
racey
dawson
bound
for
the
did
not
smoke
he
did
not
feel
like
it
he
did
not
feel
like
doing
anything
but
facing
lanpher
what
he
would
be
moved
to
do
while
facing
lanpher
he
was
not
sure
time
enough
to
cross
that
bridge
when
the
crucial
moment
should
arrive
he
knew
what
he
wanted
to
do
but
he
knew
too
that
he
could
not
do
it
unless
lanpher
made
the
first
break
otherwise
it
would
be
murder
and
racey
was
no
murderer
he
back
down
if
he
can
the
snake
racey
said
aloud
and
be
shore
to
slick
and
slime
round
till
all
blue
damn
him
riding
over
those
flowers
of
hers
racey
did
not
hurry
he
had
no
desire
to
come
up
with
lanpher
on
the
open
range
it
would
be
better
to
meet
the
man
at
his
own
where
there
were
apt
to
be
plenty
of
witnesses
racey
realized
perfectly
that
he
might
need
a
witness
several
witnesses
before
the
sunset
he
hoped
that
all
the
boys
of
the
outfit
would
be
at
the
ranch
he
hoped
that
luke
tweezy
would
be
there
too
lanpher
and
tweezy
together
the
pups
fat
jakey
pooley
playmates
he
muttered
and
swore
again
heartily
he
understood
now
the
true
reason
for
jack
harpe
lack
of
activity
this
purchasing
by
lanpher
and
tweezy
of
the
dale
mortgage
was
the
eminently
safe
and
lawful
plan
of
jakey
pooley
in
his
letter
fat
jakey
had
written
that
it
would
take
longer
and
was
it
taking
longer
it
was
racey
thought
he
saw
the
plan
in
its
entirety
and
was
in
a
boil
accordingly
he
would
have
been
in
considerably
more
of
a
boil
had
he
been
blessed
with
the
ability
to
read
the
future
when
he
rode
in
among
the
buildings
of
the
ranch
his
eyes
were
gratified
by
the
sight
of
bill
allen
straddling
a
in
front
of
the
bunkhouse
and
having
his
hair
cut
by
rod
rockwell

where

the

skipping

racey
left
alone
with
rod
rockwell
smiled
slightly
bill
ai
got
a
sense
of
humour
this
mornin
he
observed
softly
he
must
thought
i
meant
it
there
was
no
answering
smile
on
rod
features
as
he
looked
up
at
racey
dawson
racey
said

laying
a
hand
on
the
horse
mane

his

fading
out
then
keep
on
stayin

as
bad
as
that
as
bad
as
that
mcfluke
been

racey
next
question
if

only

it
would
be
a
mighty
short
hoss
to
curry
then
there
are
others
plenty
rod

a
short
hard
laugh
all
of

they

on
the
four
of

and

when

he
took
me
with

said
he

that
just
like

lot
to

aw
since

too
big
for
his

racey
seriously
that
kansas

of
you
had
yore
gall

next
time

they

to
a
feller
face
they

my
friend
said
rod
simply
anyway
you
keep
away
from
mcfluke
maybe
i
will
take
yore
advice
it
has
its
points
of
interest
as
the
feller
said
when
he
sat
down
on
the
porkumpine
and
speakin
of
porkumpines
have
you
seen
lanpher
shore
him
and
alicran
pulled
in
a
hour
ago
guess
he
in
the
office
lanpher
see
anything
of
tweezy
lately
luke
seems
to
be
living
with
us
i
never
knowed
him
and
lanpher
was
good
friends
racey
cast
at
a
venture
i
did
either
till
lately
jack
harpe
ever
come
out
here
feller
supposed
to
have
capital
hangs
out
in
farewell
the
one
that
marie
girl
tried
to
down
bo
he
ai
been
here
as
i
know
of
but
then
he
could
easy
drift
in
and
out
and
me
not
know
it
racey
nodded
marie
jump
jack
again
do
you
know
he
asked
damfino
do
guess
so
though
i
seen
her
pass
him
on
main
street
and
she
did
even
look
at
him
i
bet
he
looked
at
her
you
can
gamble
he
did
he
ai
trustin
her
not
him
i
wonder
what
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
fuss
between
him
an
her
a
sharp
glance
at
racey
accompanied
this
remark
i
dunno
yawned
racey
they
say
harpe
has
had
a
career
both
high
wide
and
handsome
that
what
i
call
one
too
many
grinned
rod
rockwell
you
can
put
down
a
bet
the
career
has
been
one
too
many
too
yeah
said
rod
wondering
what
was
coming
next
yeah
said
racey
nodding
mysteriously
but
disappointing
his
friend
by
immediately
changing
the
subject
say
rod
i
take
it
as
a
favour
if
you
and
tile
and
bill
would
sort
of
freeze
round
the
bunkhouse
till
after
i
through
with
lanpher
shore
said
rod
tweezy
in
the
office
too
i
guess
racey
nodded
and
started
his
horse
toward
the
office
he
understood
well
enough
that
rod
and
the
other
two
punchers
would
not
interfere
in
any
way
with
him
and
whatever
acts
he
might
be
called
upon
to
perform
during
his
conversation
with
lanpher
loyal
to
the
last
cartridge
and
after
whenever
it
was
ranch
business
none
of
the
punchers
ever
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
go
out
of
his
way
so
far
as
lanpher
personally
was
concerned
the
manager
was
not
the
man
either
to
engender
or
to
foster
personal
loyalty
at
the
open
doorway
of
the
office
racey
dismounted
he
dropped
the
reins
over
his
horse
head
and
walked
to
the
doorway
there
he
stopped
and
looked
in
he
saw
lanpher
sitting
behind
his
big
homemade
desk
lanpher
was
watching
him
at
one
side
of
the
desk
on
a
chair
tilted
back
against
the
wall
sat
luke
tweezy
luke
was
chewing
a
straw
his
eyes
were
half
closed
but
racey
detected
their
glitter
luke
tweezy
was
not
overlooking
any
bets
at
that
moment
racey
stepped
across
the
doorsill
and
halted
just
within
the
room
the
thumb
of
his
left
hand
was
hooked
in
his
belt
his
right
hand
hung
at
his
side
he
was
ready
for
action
lanpher
said
racey
without
preliminary
i
want
to
serve
notice
on
you
here
and
now
that
if
i
catch
you
within
one
mile
of
moccasin
spring
you
come
because
i
will
lanpher
hand
remained
motionless
on
the
desktop
then
the
man
picked
up
a
pencil
and
began
to
tap
it
on
the
wood
he
licked
his
lips
is
that
a
threat
or
a
promise
he
asked
you
can
take
it
she
both
racey
told
him
you
hear
that
luke
lanpher
turned
to
luke
tweezy
threatenin
my
life
huh
shore
nodded
luke
tweezy
actionable
that
is
must
threaten
a
man
life
racey
against
the
law
you
know
racey
moved
to
one
side
and
leaned
his
back
comfortably
against
the
wall
against
the
law
huh
luke
he
said
nervously
then
i
can
be
arrested
you
can
luke
tweezy
declared
with
evident
relish
that
is
you
can
if
lanpher
wants
to
make
a
complaint
you
hear
lanpher
asked
racey
still
more
nervously
you
wan
na
make
a
complaint
huh
lanpher
had
not
failed
to
note
the
nervousness
of
racey
tone
now
he
licked
his
lips
again
he
felt
quite
cheerful
of
a
sudden
it
gave
him
a
warm
and
pleasant
feeling
to
think
that
racey
dawson
was
to
a
certain
degree
in
his
power
having
licked
his
lips
several
times
he
rubbed
his
chin
judicially
and
coughed
likewise
judicially
well
i
dunno
as
i
wan
na
make
a
complaint
exactly
he
said
slowly
but
you
wan
na
walk
a
chalkline
round
here
racey
you
got
too
much
to
say
for
a
fact
what
do
you
think
luke
queried
racey
have
i
got
too
much
to
say
you
heard
what
lanpher
said
replied
the
cautious
luke
yep
i
heard
all
right
i
just
wanted
to
get
yore
opinion
because
i
ai
through
yet
through
talking
i
mean
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
that
i
would
be
particular
about
catching
lanpher
round
moccasin
spring
if
i
only
he
been
hanging
round
there
it
would
be
enough
meaning
you
drill
him
on
suspicion
meaning
i
do
just
that
now
yo
threatenin
me
again
thus
lanpher
takes
you
a
long
time
to
wake
up
do
it
the
nervousness
had
vanished
from
racey
voice
lanpher
you
lousy
skunk
why
do
you
pull
there
a
gun
in
that
open
drawer
not
six
inches
from
your
hand
go
after
it
you
lanpher
was
not
inordinately
brave
he
would
go
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
an
appeal
to
lethal
weapons
but
racey
words
were
more
than
he
could
stand
his
hand
jerked
sidewise
and
down
toward
the
sixshooter
in
the
open
drawer
bang
shooting
from
the
hip
racey
drove
an
accurate
bullet
through
the
manager
right
forearm
lanpher
grunted
and
gurgled
with
pain
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
seize
his
weapon
with
his
left
hand
luke
tweezy
picked
himself
up
from
the
floor
where
he
had
thrown
himself
a
split
second
before
the
shot
luke
tweezy
leathery
face
was
mottled
yellow
with
rage
i
get
you
ten
years
for
this
he
squalled
pointing
a
long
arm
at
racey
you
started
this
fight
you
tried
to
murder
him
oh
say
not
so
said
racey
if
i
wanted
to
kill
him
i
plugged
him
in
the
arm
would
i
that
would
been
sensible
you
provoked
this
fraycas
snarled
luke
disregarding
racey
point
in
a
true
way
you
why
no
luke
yo
wrong
all
wrong
interrupted
swing
tunstall
leaning
over
the
windowsill
at
tweezy
back
i
seen
the
whole
thing
i
did
and
i
did
see
racey
do
anything
he
should
i
could
swear
to
it
on
the
stand
if
i
had
to
he
added
thoughtfully
come
then
rod
rockwell
bill
allen
and
tile
stanton
from
the
bunkhouse
none
made
any
comment
on
the
state
of
affairs
but
while
rod
fetched
water
in
a
basin
bill
allen
cut
away
the
sleeve
of
his
groaning
employer
and
made
all
ready
a
few
minutes
later
alicran
skeel
entered
the
office
i
thought
i
heard
a
gun
he
drawled
his
calm
eyes
embracing
everyone
in
the
room
that
man
bubbled
luke
tweezy
shaking
his
fist
at
racey
that
man
tried
to
kill
lanpher
i
call
upon
you
not
to
let
him
leave
the
premises
until
i
can
go
to
farewell
and
swear
out
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
that
man
said
swing
tunstall
pointing
a
derisive
finger
at
luke
tweezy
is
a
liar
by
the
clock
i
saw
the
whole
thing
and
all
i
got
ta
say
is
that
lanpher
went
after
his
gun
first
i
ai
doubting
yore
word
swing
alicran
said
tactfully
but
they
seems
to
be
a
difference
of
opinion
sort
of
and
i
say
that
luke
tweezy
is
a
damn
liar
reasserted
swing
and
they
ai
no
difference
of
opinion
about
that
well
of
course
if
luke
alicran
did
not
complete
the
sentence
i
am
a
lawyer
luke
tweezy
explained
hurriedly
i
ai
paying
any
attention
to
what
his
man
says
now
or
any
other
time
jibed
swing
any
of
you
boys
see
this
alicran
asked
of
his
three
punchers
he
tried
to
kill
me
i
tell
you
lanpher
gritted
through
his
teeth
he
did
gim
me
a
chance
any
of
you
boys
see
it
repeated
alicran
paying
no
attention
to
lanpher
how
could
we
asked
rod
rockwell
glancing
up
from
the
bandaging
of
lanpher
arm
we
was
all
in
the
bunkhouse
then
for
the
benefit
of
the
gents
who
was
here
said
racey
smoothly
i
do
mind
saying
that
i
told
lanpher
to
go
after
his
gun
and
he
did
and
i
did
he
a
liar
gibbered
lanpher
alicran
ai
you
man
enough
to
take
care
of
racey
dawson
alicran
nodded
composedly
i
guess
him
and
me
would
come
to
some
kind
of
an
agreement
provided
i
was
shore
he
needed
taking
care
of
but
i
ai
none
shore
he
does
looks
like
it
was
a
even
break
to
me
the
word
of
you
and
luke
against
his
and
swing
and
what
fairer
than
that
i
like
to
know
alicran
squalled
lanpher
i
telling
you
to
yo
all

up
that
whatsa

alicran
assured
him
you

after

you
and

and
when

get
all
well
lanpher

in
racey
will
i
still
be
a
liar
like
you
say
lanpher
looked
at
racey
and
looked
away
his
heated
blood
was
cooling
fast
his
arm
lord
how
it
hurt
he
perceived
that
discretion
was
necessary
to
preserve
the
rest
of
his
precious
skin
from
future
perforation
i
i
guess
i
was
a
hasty
he
mumbled
his
eyelids
lowered
now
that
what
i
call
right
down
handsome
for
you
drawled
racey
gawd
knows
i
ai
a
hawg

satisfied
luke

the
corral
together
i
got
a
secret
for
yore
pearly
ear
it
was
obvious
that
luke
tweezy
was
of
two
minds
racey
grinned
to
see
the
other
hesitation
what
you
scared
of
luke
he
inquired
it
ai
far
to
the
corral
and
you

me
while

of
course
if

luke
when

happier
there
i
ai

a
thing
to

declared
luke
tweezy
but
if
you
want
to
we
go
out
to
the
corral
they
went
out
to
the
corral
and
racey
found
a
seat
on
an
empty
nailkeg
luke
tweezy
sat
perforce
on
the
hardbaked
ground
he
hunched
up
his
legs
clasped
his
hands
round
his
shins
and
rested
his
sharp
chin
on
his
bony
knees
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
racey
the
latter
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
begin
he
rolled
a
cigarette
with
irritating
slowness
to
force
one
opponent
to
wait
is
always
good
strategy
well
said
luke
tweezy
is
it
smiled
racey
have
it
yore
own
way
if
you
like
lookit

a
click

glared
down
at
racey
dawson
his
little
eyes
shone
with
spite
say
it
urged
racey
you

the
heel
of
his
hand

it
do
seem
to
stick
up
half
so
big
dale
sank
down
upon
one
heel
and
stared
blearily
off
across
the
flats
the
bottle
in
his
made
a
pronounced
bulge
under
the
cloth
i
dunno
what
to
do
racey
he
said
looking
up
sidewise
at
racey
where
he
stood
in
front
of
him
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
i
owe
a
lot
of
money
i
dunno
how
i
gon
na

and
i
worried
let
the
other
feller

the
worrying
suggested
racey
i
wish
i

said
dale
drearily
i
wish
i
could
why

he
foreclose
they
foreclose

you

racey
she
thisaway
i
borrowed
five
thousand
dollars
from
the
marysville
bank
on
a
mortgage
and
there
they
went
and
sold
the
mortgage
to
lanpher
of
the
and
luke
tweezy
and
there
the
rub
racey
the
bank
would
renewed
all
right
but
you
can
put
down
a
bet
and
go
the
limit
that
lanpher
and
tweezy
wo
i
done
asked
five
thousand
dollars
is
a
lot
of
money
said
racey
soberly
he
had
been
thinking
that
the
mortgage
would
not
have
been
above
two
thousand
at
the
outside
but
five
thousand
what
in
sam
hill
had
old
dale
done
with
the
money
in
the
next
breath
dale
answered
the
unspoken
question
i
needed
the
money
he
said
in
a
low
voice
his
eyes
lowered
and
and
i
had
bad
luck
with
it
yeah
i
know
the
cattle
dying
and
all
cattle
what
cattle
dale
stared
blankly
at
racey
oh
them
hell
they
did
have
nothin
to
do
with
it
them
cattle
did
worked
out
a
system
racey
a
system
to
beat
roulette
and
i
was
shore
it
was
all
right
by
gawd
it
was
all
right
they
was
nothin
wrong
with
that
system
but
i
had
bad
luck
i
had
most
awful
bad
luck
and
the
system
i
take
it
did
work
it
did
against
my
bad
luck
dale
again
dropped
his
eyes
and
racey
stared
down
at
the
old
figure
with
something
akin
to
pity
in
his
gaze
certainly
he
was
sorry
for
him
he
was
not
in
the
least
scornful
despite
the
fact
that
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
any
sensible
man
could
be
such
a
fool
a
system
a
system
to
beat
roulette
and
bad
luck
the
drably
ancient
and
story
with
which
every
unsuccessful
gambler
seeks
to
establish
an
alibi
whose
wheel
was
it
said
racey
lacey
at
marysville
in
the
back
room
of
the
sweet
dreams
huh
an
there
nothing
crooked
about
lacey
wheel
either
it
as
square
as
lacey
himself
lacey
was
the
only
wheel
they
was
mcfluke
too
so
mcfluke
had
a
wheel
had
he
this
was
news
to
racey
dawson
how
long
has
mcfluke
been
runnin
a
wheel
inquired
racey
quite
a
while
was
the
vague
reply
a
year
maybe
longer
i
dunno
funny
it
never
got
round
it
was
a
private
wheel
only
for
his
friends
nothin
public
about
it
who
used
to
play
it
besides
you
persisted
racey
hanging
to
his
subject
like
a
to
a
tramp
trousers
dale
wrinkled
his
forehead
besides
me
lessee
now
they
were
doc
coffin
nebraska
jones
honey
hoke
and
thompson
nobody
else
aw
galloway
and
norton
and
that
bunch
dale
said
shamefacedly
racey
nodded
his
head
slowly
a
crooked
wheel
of
course
it
was
crooked
why
not
that
dale
galloway
norton
and
a
few
other
gentlemen
of
the
neighbourhood
were
under
their
wives
thumbs
to
such
a
degree
that
they
did
not
dare
to
gamble
openly
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
what
more
natural
than
that
someone
should
provide
them
with
a
private
gambling
place
with
such
cappers
as
nebraska
and
his
gang
losers
would
not
feel
equal
to
making
much
of
an
outcry
it
must
be
a
paying
occupation
for
mcfluke
nebraska
or
whoever
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
racey
nodded
again
and
squatted
down
on
his
heels
he
picked
up
a
stick
and
squinted
along
its
length
none
of
my
business
of
course
he
said
casually
but
would
you
mind
telling
me
how
much
you
lost
to
mcfluke
about
seven
thousand
racey
looked
up
at
the
sky
seven
thousand
dollars
the
full
amount
of
the
mortgage
and
two
thousand
more
and
mcfluke
had
it
all
you
see
said
dale
dolefully
i
began
to
make
money
after
i
been
here
awhile
and
my
health
come
back
yeah
i
made
money
all
right
all
right
he
pushed
back
his
hat
and
scratched
a
grizzled
head
i
had
luck
he
added
but
you
was
round
here
then
gone
to
the
bend
yep

so
straight
mac

so
crooked
he
could
swallow
a
nail
and
spit
out
a
corkscrew
and
he
got
that
wheel
trained
you
just
bet
he
has
look
under
the
table
and
see
what
he
doing
with
his
feet
or
his
knees
my
gawd
dale
did

a
brake
like

shore

on
the
level

you

rubbed
his
chin
i
was
here
when
molly

nodded
miserably
he
was
too
utterly
wretched
to
resent
racey
interference
with
his
affairs
she
she
told
me
he
said

they
know
about
the
other
two
thousand

do
you
think

can
get
a
easy
rate
from
old
salt
asked
dale
the
light
of
a
new
hope
dawning
in
his
faded
old
eyes
it
a
awful
tax
on
a
feller
paying
the
full
legal
rate
we
have
to
take
what
we
can
get
but
i
do
my
best
to
tone
it
down
sometimes
a
man
will
take
less
if
he
has
another
object
in
view
besides
the
interest
and
you
bet
old
salt
will
have
a
plenty
big
object
in
view
in
keeping
out
lanpher
and
tweezy
money
ai
tight
now
anyway
i
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
do
you
fret
you
go
on
in
now
and
square
up
with
the
women
and
i
slide
out
to
the
bar
s
instanter
dale
the
poor
old
man
laid
a
hand
on
racey
strong
young
forearm
i
tell
he
said
i
tell
you
you
fix
it
up
with
old
salt
abruptly
he
turned
away
and
hobbled
hurriedly
around
the
corner
of
the
barn
chapter
xix
the
shooting
racey
dawson
riding
back
to
moccasin
spring
was
in
a
warm
and
pleasant
frame
of
mind
with
him
rode
old
salt
and
with
old
salt
rode
old
salt
check
book
racey
had
after
much
argument
and
persuasion
made
excellent
arrangements
with
saltoun
the
latter
anxious
though
he
was
to
own
the
dale
place
himself
had
agreed
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
bought
by
lanpher
and
tweezy
and
take
in
return
a
per
cent
mortgage
for
ten
years
no
wonder
racey
was
pleased
with
himself
he
had
a
right
to
be
as
they
crossed
the
marysville
and
farewell
trail
racey
horse
picked
up
a
fortuitous
stone
racey
dismounted
saltoun
slouching
comfortably
back
against
his
cantle
looked
doubtfully
down
at
racey
where
he
stood
humped
over
the
horse
hoof
between
his
knees
tapping
with
a
knife
handle
at
the
lodged
stone
a
mortgage
is
a
long
one
kind
of
he
said
slowly
i
thought
we
settled
all
that
racey
lifted
a
quick
head
shore
we
done
settled
it
saltoun
acquiesced
promptly
that
all
right
i
going
through
with
my
part
of
it
got
ta
do
it
nothing
else
to
do
i
was
just
that
all
racey
merely
grunted
he
resumed
his
tapping
alla
same
saltoun
said
suddenly
i
do
believe
this
jack
harpe
feller
had
anything
to
do
with
this
mortgage
deal
racey
do
you
no
i
do
you
ca
make
me
believe
they
any
coon
in

if
they
was
why

done
something
before
this
tell
me
that
why
ai
he
damfino
shore
you
do
you
was
mistaken
racey
badly
mistaken
yore
judgment
was
out
by
a
mile
she
all
just
luke
tweezy
and
that
lousy
skunk
of
a
lanpher
trying
to
act
spotty
no
more
than
that
well
ai
that
enough
shore
but
but
nothing
where
you
be
if
i
had
found
out
about
it
huh
would
you
look
nice
feedin
other
folks
cows
on
yore
grass
alla
same
they
would
been
jack
harpe
cows
which
is
all
you
know
about
it
you
never
would
take
warning
and
you
know
it
how
about
the
time
when
blakely
was
the
manager
and
they
were
rustling
yore
cattle
so
fast
it
made
a
racing
full
split
look
slow
well
but
interrupted
saltoun
beginning
to
fidget
with
his
reins
and
the
time
cutnose
canter
tried
to
run
off
a
whole
herd
of
hosses
on
you
racey
breezed
on
warming
to
his
subject
you
would
let
chuck
warn
you
oh

he
did
know
what
he
was
talking
about

a
game
you

a
nickel
if
jack

that
jack
harpe
has
made
a
move
not
a
move
but
lanpher
and
tweezy
was
in
the
bet
insisted
saltoun
it
was
jack
harpe
and
you
know
it
jack
harpe
do
start
trying
to
get
dale
ranch
away
from

and
run
cattle
in
on
you
inside
of
six
months
you

have
to
pay
us
them
was
yore
very
words
racey
i
got
wrote
down
all
so
careful
i
know
by
heart
i
bet
you
do
racey
told
him
heartily
i
gamble
you
been
studying
those
words
in
all
yore
spare
time
it
pays
to
be
careful
smiled
saltoun
always
bear
that
in
mind
i
ai
wanting
to
rub
anything
in
racey
but
if
you
been
a
mite
more
careful
just
a
mite
more
careful
you
would
be
out
so
much
at
the
finish
drinks
are
on
you
cowboy
and
when
you
stop
to
think
that
i
made
the
bet
just
the
same
if
you
wanted
lanpher
and
tweezy
in
on
it
only
you
did
guess
i
must
overlooked
huh
grinned
racey
feller
think
of
everything
can
he
i
glad
to
see
yo
taking
it
thisaway
approved
saltoun
working
for
six
months
for
nothing
do
seem
to
bother
you
i
ai
worked
six
months
for
nothing
yet
pointed
out
racey
the
six
months
ai
up
yet
you
wan
na
remember
salt
that
a
race
over
till
the
horses
cross
the
line
you
got
ta
prove
jack
harpe
connection
began
saltoun
racey
topped
his
mount
but
as
the
horse
started
he
held
him
up
lessee
who
coming
he
suggested
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
he
and
saltoun
both
turned
their
heads
someone
was
riding
toward
them
along
the
trail
from
the
direction
of
the
lazy
river
ford
racey
had
caught
the
clatter
of
the
horse
hoofs
on
the
rocks
of
a
wash
wherein
the
trail
lay
concealed
siftin
right
along
said
saltoun
racey
nodded
horse
and
rider
slid
into
sight
above
the
side
of
the
wash
and
trotted
toward
them
looks
like
thompson
said
saltoun
it
is
thompson
confirmed
racey
did
it
strike
you
he
sort
of
hesitated
a
bit
when
he
first
seen
us
like
a
man
would
whose
breakfast
did
rest
easy
on
his
stomach
as
you
might
say
saltoun
nodded
he
did
sway
back
on
them
lines
at
the
top
and
he
ai
boiling
along
quite
as
fast
now
as
he
was
in
the
wash
elaborated
racey
i
noticed
that
too
admitted
saltoun
they
waited
barring
the
trail
thompson
did
not
attempt
to
ride
around
them
he
pulled
up
and
nodded
easily
to
the
two
men
they
been
a
fraycas
down
at
mcfluke
thompson
said
fraycas
racey
cocked
an
eyebrow
yeah
old
dale
and
a
stranger
racey
nodded
he
knew
with
a
great
certainty
what
was
coming
next
anybody
hurt
he
asked
old
dale
bad
killed
racey
nodded
again
even
break
we
do
think
so
thompson
stated
frankly
who
we
queried
racey
oh
austin
honey
hoke
doc
coffin
mcfluke
jack
harpe
lanpher
and
luke
tweezy
we
all
just
did
like
the
way
the
stranger
went
at
it
so
i
going
to
farewell
after
the
sheriff
yo
holdin
the
stranger
then
i
take
it
put
in
saltoun
well
no
not
exactly
replied
thompson
he
got
away
that
stranger
did
and
did
none
of
you
make
any
try
at
stopping
him
demanded
racey
plenty
thompson
replied
with
a
stony
face
i
took
a
shot
at
him
myself
just
as
he
was
hopping
through
the
window
i
missed
yet
they
say
yo
a
good
snap
shot
thompson
threw
in
racey
i
am
most
usual
admitted
thompson
but
this
time
my
hand
must
shook
or
something
yep
concurred
racey
i
shore
guess
it
must
shook
or
something
thompson
faced
racey
something
he
repeated
hardily
meaning
what
i
said
replied
racey
calmly
i
never
mean
more
i
say
ever
thompson
continued
to
regard
racey
fixedly
saltoun
was
glad
that
he
himself
was
two
yards
to
the
right
and
he
would
not
have
objected
to
double
the
distance
racey
hands
were
folded
on
the
horn
of
his
saddle
thompson
right
hand
hung
at
his
side
racey
had
told
the
truth
when
he
spoke
of
thompson
as
a
good
snap
shot
he
was
all
of
that
and
he
was
fairly
quick
on
the
draw
as
well
it
would
seem
that
taking
into
consideration
the
position
of
thompson
right
hand
that
thompson
had
a
shade
the
better
of
it
racey
thought
so
but
he
hoped
nevertheless
by
shooting
through
the
bottom
of
his
holster
to
plant
at
least
one
bullet
in
thompson
before
the
latter
killed
him
the
decision
lay
with
thompson
would
he
elect
to
fight
racey
could
almost
see
the
thoughts
at
conflict
behind
thompson
frontal
bone
saltoun
hoping
against
hope
sat
tensely
silent
racey
eyes
held
thompson
steadily
slowly
inch
by
inch
thompson
right
hand
moved
upward
and
away
from
the
gun
butt
he
gathered
his
reins
in
his
left
hand
and
with
his
hitherto
menacing
right
he
tilted
his
hat
forward
and
began
to
scratch
the
back
of
his
head
if
you
do
mean
more
you
say
offered
thompson
you
do
mean
much
which
is
all
the
way
you
look
at
it
said
racey
and
a
damn
good
way
too
nipped
in
saltoun
hurriedly
inwardly
cursing
racey
for
not
letting
well
enough
alone
what
was
the
fight
about
thompson
cards
said
thompson
laconically
switching
his
eyes
briefly
to
saltoun
face
and
the
stranger
him
inquired
racey
something
like
that
but
i
ca
say
for
shore
i
was
playing
with
him
doc
coffin
was
and
so
was
honey
hoke
and
peaches
austin
peaches
said
he
kind
of
had
an
idea
the
stranger
dealt
himself
a
card
from
the
bottom
just
before
old
dale
started
to
crawl
his
hump
but
peaches
ai
shore
about
it
old
dale
is
the
only
one
was
shore
and
he
dead
and
yo
going
for
the
coroner
huh
asked
racey
i
said
so
but
you
did
say
if
anybody
was
chasing
the
stranger
now
are
they
shore
was
the
prompt
reply
they
all
took
out
after
him
all
except
mcfluke
that
is
racey
nodded
i
expect
mcfluke
would
want
to
stay
with
dale
he
said
gently
just
as
you
want
to
go
to
farewell
after
the
coroner
yo
shore
it
is
the
coroner
thompson
say
how
many
times
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
demanded
the
badgered
thompson
of
course
it
the
coroner
in
a
case
like
this
the
coroner
got
ta
be
notified
i
expect
assented
racey
i
expect
but
if
yo
really
goin
for
the
coroner
thompson
what
made
you
tell
us
when
you
first
met
us
you
were
going
for
the
sheriff
why
said
thompson
without
a
quiver
i
for
him
too
i
must
forgot
to
say
so
at
first
yeah
i
guess
you
did
thus
racey
annoyed
that
thompson
had
contrived
to
crawl
through
the
fence
he
had
hoped
that
thompson
might
be
tempted
to
a
demonstration
for
which
potentiality
he
racey
had
prepared
by
removing
his
right
hand
from
the
saddle
horn
it
do
always
pay
to
forget
thompson
suggested
saltoun
coldly
it
do
thompson
assented
readily
and
i
do
most
always
do
stay
here
any
longer
on
our
account
thompson
said
racey
you
told
us
about
enough
try
and
remember
it
thompson
bade
him
and
lifted
his
reins
we
will
and
on
the
other
hand
do
you
forget
yore
sheriff
and
yore
coroner
i
wo
grinned
thompson
and
rode
past
and
away
he
ai
goin
for
the
sheriff
and
the
coroner
any
more
i
am
declared
saltoun
disgustedly
turning
in
the
saddle
to
gaze
after
the
vanishing
horseman
of
course
he
ai
almost
barked
racey
in
this
country
fellers
like
thompson
do
ride
hellbent
just
to
tell
the
sheriff
and
the
coroner
a
feller
has
been
killed
murder
ai
any
such
as
all
that
unless
he
added
thoughtfully
thompson
is
the
stranger
you
mean
thompson
might
killed
him
i
do
think
it
would
spoil
his
appetite
any
you
remember
how
fast
he
was
pelting
along
down
in
the
wash
and
how
he
slowed
up
after
seeing
us
a
murderer
would
act
just
thataway
saltoun
nodded
a
gent
ca
do
anything
on
guesswork
he
said
bromidically
facts
are
what
count
you
find
before
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
business
observed
racey
sagely
that
guesswork
is
gon
na
lead
us
to
a
whole
heap
of
facts
i
hope
so
saltoun
said
uncomfortably
conscious
that
the
death
of
dale
might
seriously
complicate
the
lifting
of
the
mortgage
racey
was
no
less
uncomfortable
and
for
the
same
reason
he
felt
sure
that
the
killing
of
dale
had
been
inspired
in
order
to
settle
once
for
all
the
future
of
the
dale
ranch
no
wonder
luke
tweezy
had
been
so
positive
in
his
assertion
that
old
man
saltoun
would
not
lend
any
money
to
dale
the
latter
had
been
marked
for
death
at
the
time
despite
the
fact
that
tweezy
and
harpe
were
at
last
being
seen
together
in
public
thus
indicating
that
the
deal
to
quote
letter
to
tweezy
had
been
sprung
racey
doubted
that
the
murder
formed
part
of
jacob
pooley
absolutely
safe
plan
for
forcing
out
dale
while
in
some
ways
the
murder
might
be
considered
sufficiently
safe
the
method
of
it
and
the
act
itself
did
not
smack
of
handiwork
it
was
much
more
probable
that
the
killing
was
the
climax
of
luke
tweezy
original
plan
adhered
to
by
the
attorney
and
his
friends
against
the
advice
and
wishes
of
jacob
pooley
guess
we
better
go
on
to
mcfluke
was
racey
suggestion
they
went
looks
like
they
got
back
mighty
soon
from
chasing
the
stranger
said
racey
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
place
eying
the
number
of
horses
tied
to
the
maybe
they
got
him
quick
saltoun
offered
sardonically
they
rode
on
and
added
their
horses
to
the
string
in
front
of
the
saloon
racey
did
not
fail
to
note
that
none
of
the
other
horses
gave
any
evidence
of
having
been
ridden
either
hard
or
lately
which
in
the
face
of
thompson
assertion
that
the
men
he
left
behind
had
ridden
in
pursuit
of
the
murderer
seemed
rather
odd
or
perhaps
it
was
not
so
odd
looking
upon
it
from
another
angle
the
saloon
when
they
had
ridden
up
had
been
quiet
as
the
grave
it
remained
equally
silent
when
they
entered
mcfluke
behind
the
bar
wearing
a
black
eye
and
a
puffed
nose
nodded
to
them
civilly
in
chairs
ranged
round
the
walls
sat
an
assortment
of
men
peaches
austin
luke
tweezy
jack
harpe
doc
coffin
honey
hoke
and
lanpher
the
latter
was
nursing
a
slung
right
arm
they
were
all
there
the
men
mentioned
by
name
by
thompson
as
having
been
in
the
place
when
dale
was
killed
what
is
this
a
graveyard
meetin
asked
racey
of
mcfluke
glancing
from
the
assembled
multitude
to
mcfluke
and
smiling
slightly
it
was
no
part
of
wisdom
thought
racey
to
let
these
men
know
of
his
encounter
with
thompson
he
had
thompson
story
he
was
anxious
to
hear
theirs
a
graveyard
meeting
repeated
the
well
and
what
it
is
in
a
manner
of
speaking
racey
stared
i
bite
what
the
answer
the
cleared
his
throat
old
dale
been
killed
has
huh
who
killed
him
racey
allowed
his
eyes
casually
to
skim
the
expressionless
faces
of
the
men
backed
against
the
walls
a
stranger
killed
him
replied
mcfluke
heavily
racey
removed
his
eyes
from
the
countenance
of
the
to
luke
tweezy
luke
little
eyes
met
his
you
saw
this
stranger
luke
he
asked
luke
tweezy
nodded
we
all
saw
him
he
was
playing
draw
with
honey
hoke
and
peaches
austin
and
me
doc
coffin
offered
oilily
and
the
stranger
amended
racey
and
the
stranger
doc
coffin
accepted
the
amendment
what
was
the
trouble
pursued
racey
well
we
kind
of
thought
doc
coffin
eyes
slid
round
to
cross
an
instant
the
shifty
gaze
of
peaches
austin
we
thought
maybe
this
stranger
dealt
a
card
from
the
bottom
we
ai
none
shore
dale
said
he
did
anyhow
said
peaches
austin
he
said
so
twice
put
in
lanpher
racey
turned
deliberately
you
here
said
he
softly
i
did
see
you
at
first
i
must
be
getting
nearsighted
you
saw
the
whole
thing
did
you
lanpher
yeah
replied
lanpher
who
pulled
first
the
stranger
the
answer
came
patly
from
at
least
five
different
men
racey
looked
grimly
upon
those
present
most
everybody
seems
shore
the
stranger
to
blame
he
observed
besides
saying
the
stranger
was
dealing
from
the
bottom
did
dale
use
any
other
fighting
words
he
called
him
a
tinhorn
burst
simultaneously
from
the
lips
of
mcfluke
and
peaches
austin
only
two
this
time
said
racey
shooting
a
swift
glance
at
jack
harpe
and
overjoyed
to
find
the
latter
dividing
a
glare
of
disgust
between
mcfluke
and
austin
but
you
have
to
do
better
than
that
saltoun
shivered
inwardly
he
was
a
man
of
courage
but
not
of
foolhardy
courage
the
species
of
courage
that
dares
death
unnecessarily
he
was
getting
on
in
years
and
hoped
when
it
came
his
time
to
die
to
pass
out
peacefully
in
his
nightshirt
and
here
was
that
fool
of
a
racey
practically
telling
harpe
and
the
other
rascals
that
he
was
on
to
their
game
no
wonder
saltoun
shivered
he
expected
matters
to
come
to
push
of
pike
in
a
split
second
so
being
what
he
was
a
fairly
brave
man
in
a
tight
corner
he
put
on
a
hard
confident
expression
and
hooked
his
thumbs
in
his
belt
racey
dawson
spread
his
legs
wide
and
laughed
a
reckless
laugh
he
felt
reckless
he
likewise
felt
for
these
men
ranged
before
him
the
most
venomous
hate
of
which
he
was
capable
these
men
had
killed
the
father
of
molly
dale
it
did
not
matter
whether
any
one
or
all
of
them
had
or
had
not
committed
the
actual
murder
they
were
wholly
responsible
for
it
they
had
brought
it
about
he
knew
it
he
knew
it
just
as
sure
as
he
was
a
foot
high
and
as
he
looked
upon
them
sitting
there
in
flinty
silence
he
purposed
to
make
them
pay
and
pay
to
the
uttermost
that
the
old
man
had
been
a
gambler
and
a
drunkard
and
the
world
was
undoubtedly
a
better
world
for
his
leaving
it
were
facts
of
no
moment
in
racey
mind
he
racey
was
not
one
to
condone
either
murder
or
injustice
and
this
murder
and
the
injustice
of
it
would
cruelly
hurt
three
women
he
laughed
again
without
mirth
his
blue
eyes
glittering
through
the
slits
of
the
eyelids
were
of
wrath
his
stare
challenged
his
enemies
damn
them
let
them
shoot
if
they
wanted
to
he
was
ready
he
racey
dawson
would
show
them
a
fight
that
would
stack
up
as
well
as
any
of
which
a
territory
could
boast
so
feeling
as
he
did
racey
stared
upon
his
enemies
with
a
frosty
stare
and
mentally
dared
them
to
come
to
the
scratch
but
in
moments
like
these
there
is
always
one
to
say
let
go
or
give
its
equivalent
a
sign
and
that
one
is
invariably
the
leader
of
one
side
or
the
other
racey
dawson
saw
luke
tweezy
turn
a
slow
head
and
look
toward
jack
harpe
he
saw
doc
coffin
honey
and
austin
one
after
the
other
do
the
same
but
jack
harpe
sat
immobile
he
neither
spoke
nor
gave
a
sign
perhaps
he
did
not
consider
the
present
a
sufficiently
propitious
moment
no
one
knew
what
he
thought
had
he
known
what
the
future
held
in
store
he
might
have
gone
after
his
gun
tense
nerves
racey
and
saltoun
awaited
the
decision
it
came
and
like
many
decisions
its
form
was
totally
unexpected
jack
harpe
looked
at
racey
and
said
smilelessly

chapter

drawing
the
cover
you
do
understand
it
do
you
peaches
racey
inquired
genially
of
peaches
austin
when
he
found
himself
neighbours
with
that
slippery
gentleman
at
the
inquest
peaches
shied
away
from
racey
on
general
principles
he
feared
a
catch
there
were
so
many
things
about
racey
that
he
did
not
understand
whatcha
talking
about
peaches
grunted
surlily
you
me
chuck
everybody
more
or
less
you
do
do
you
do
what
a
trifle
more
surlily
you
do
see
how
and
why
chuck
morgan
is
so
friendly
with
me
and
how
i
for
a
good
outfit
like
the
bar
s
when
the
last
you
seen
of
me
chuck
was
me
up
the
trail
with
my
hands
over
my
head
you
do
understand
it
none
i
can
see
it
in
your
light
green
eyes
peaches
peaches
modestly
veiled
his
pale
green
eyes
beneath
dropped
lids
and
turned
his
head
away
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
go
elsewhere
but
to
do
that
would
be
to
make
himself
conspicuous
and
there
were
many
reasons
all
more
or
less
cogent
why
he
did
not
wish
to
make
himself
conspicuous
peaches
sat
still
on
his
chair
and
broke
into
a
gentle
perspiration
racey
perceived
the
other
discomfort
and
ached
to
increase
it
did
you
stay
here
days
like
i
told
you
to
that
time
a
few
weeks
ago
and
was
jack
harpe
most
hot
under
the
collar
when
you
did
see
him
final
and
if
so
what
happened
racey
gaped
at
peaches
like
an
expectant
terrier
watching
a
it
may
be
that
peaches
felt
like
a
holed
rat
in
a
hole
too
small
for
comfort
he
turned
on
racey
with
a
flash
of
defiance
there
was
a
feller
once
said
peaches
who
bit
off
more
he
could
chew
i
heard
of
him
racey
admitted
gravely
he
was
first
cousin
to
the
other
feller
that
grabbed
the
bear
by
the
tail
i
dunno
whose
first
cousin
he
was
frowned
peaches
all
i
know
is
he
did
show
good
sense
now
that
said
racey
is
where
you
and
i
do
think
alike
i
may
be
wrong
in
what
i
think
i
may
have
made
a
mistake
but
i
got
ta
be
showed
why
and
wherefore
anybody
is
welcome
to
show
me
peaches
just
anybody
racey
accompanied
his
remarks
with
a
chilling
look
the
perspiration
of
peaches
turned
clammy
meaning
peaches
queried
meaning
why
meaning
that
you
can
show
me
if
you
like
peaches
this
was
too
much
for
peaches
he
was
out
of
his
depth
and
unable
to
swim
he
sank
with
a
gurgle
of
i
dunno
what
yo
drivin
at
racey
shook
a
sorrowful
head
i
shore
sorry
to
hear
it
i
was
guessin
you
did
i
had
hopes
of
you
peaches
you
done
gim
me
a
disappointment
yep
she
a
cruel
world
when
all
said
and
done
this
was
too
much
for
peaches
he
resolved
to
shift
his
seat
whether
it
made
him
conspicuous
or
not
the
gambler
removed
to
a
vacant
windowsill
upon
which
he
sat
and
looked
anywhere
but
at
racey
dawson
that
young
man
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
surveyed
the
multitude
besides
the
citizens
found
in
the
saloon
on
his
and
arrival
there
were
now
present
dolan
who
combined
with
his
office
of
justice
of
the
peace
that
of
coroner
and
twelve
good
men
and
true
the
coroner
jury
and
most
intimate
friends
ready
and
willing
at
any
and
all
times
to
serve
the
territory
for
ten
dollars
a
day
and
expenses
in
addition
to
this
representative
group
alicran
skeel
had
dropped
in
from
nowhere
chuck
morgan
had
driven
over
with
a
wagon
from
soogan
creek
mercifully
the
family
at
moccasin
spring
had
not
yet
been
informed
of
their
bereavement
and
sheriff
jake
rule
and
his
deputy
kansas
casey
had
ridden
out
from
farewell
thompson
had
returned
with
the
sheriff
which
circumstance
either
disposed
of
the
theory
that
thompson
was
the
murderer
or
else
thompson
had
more
nerve
than
he
was
supposed
to
have
racey
began
to
nurse
a
distinct
grievance
against
thompson
the
main
room
of
the
saloon
into
which
the
body
had
been
brought
from
the
back
room
was
a
fog
of
smoke
and
a
blabber
of
voices
mcfluke
had
not
been
idle
at
the
bar
and
the
coroner
jury
was
three
parts
drunk
the
members
had
not
yet
agreed
on
a
verdict
but
the
delay
was
a
mere
matter
of
form
they
always
liked
to
stretch
the
time
and
give
the
territory
a
good
run
for
her
money
racey
dawson
conscious
that
both
jack
harpe
and
luke
tweezy
were
watching
him
covertly
rolled
a
meticulous
cigarette
he
scratched
a
match
on
the
chair
seat
held
it
to
the
end
of
the
cigarette
and
stared
across
the
pulsing
flame
straight
into
the
eyes
of
the
marysville
lawyer
tweezy
gaze
wavered
and
fell
away
racey
inhaled
strongly
then
got
to
his
feet
and
lazed
across
to
the
bar
where
jake
rule
with
kansas
casey
at
his
elbow
was
perfunctorily
questioning
mcfluke
the
latter
hard
blue
eyes
narrowed
at
racey
approach
racey
as
he
draped
himself
against
the
bar
was
careful
to
nudge
casey
foot
with
a
surreptitious
toe
jake
said
racey
would
i
be
interruptin
the
proceedings
too
much
if
i
made
a
motion
for
us
to
drink
all
round
not
declared
the
sheriff
heartily
racey
turned
to
mcfluke
when
their
hands
had
encircled
the
glasses
for
the
third
time
racey
instead
of
drinking
suddenly
looked
across
the
bar
at
mcfluke
who
was
industriously
swabbing
the
bar
top
mac
he
said
easily
when
that
stranger
ran
out
the
door
how
many
gents
fired
at
him
punch
thompson
replied
mcfluke
the
sushing
cloth
stopping
abruptly
you
heard
him
tell
the
coroner
how
he
fired
and
missed
did
you
oh
i
heard
i
heard
racey
answered
no
harm
in
asking
again
is
there
ca
be
too
shore
about
these
here
killin
can
you
mac
which
door
did
the
stranger
run
through
the
one
into
the
back
room
or
the
one
leadin
outdoors
why
the
one
leadin
outdoors
of
course
mcfluke
surprise
at
the
question
was
evident
jake
said
racey
now
you
ask
punch
thompson
what
the
stranger
was
doing
when
he
cut
down
on
him
the
sheriff
regarded
racey
with
his
keen
gray
gaze
then
he
faced
about
and
singled
out
thompson
from
a
conversational
group
across
the
room
punch
he
called
and
then
put
racey
question
in
his
own
words
what
was
he
doin
said
thompson
heedless
of
mcfluke
agonized
expression
which
he
was
hoppin
through
that
window
there
here
he
indicated
the
middle
one
of
three
in
the
side
of
the
room
when
i
drawed
and
missed
i
only
had
time
for
the
one
shot
at
this
there
was
a
sudden
scrabbling
behind
the
bar
it
was
mcfluke
trying
to
retreat
through
the
doorway
into
the
back
room
and
being
prevented
from
accomplishing
his
purpose
by
racey
dawson
who
at
the
innkeeper
first
movement
had
vaulted
the
bar
and
grabbed
him
by
the
neck
none
of
that
now
cautioned
racey
dawson
his
right
hand
flashing
down
and
up
as
mcfluke
finding
that
escape
was
out
of
the
question
made
a
desperate
snatch
at
the
protruding
from
his
bootleg
the
reacted
immediately
to
the
cold
menace
of
the
pressing
against
the
top
of
his
spinal
column
he
straightened
sullenly
racey
transferring
the
to
the
small
of
mcfluke
back
stooped
swiftly
drew
out
mcfluke
knife
and
tossed
it
through
a
window

wo
be
needing
that
again
said
racey
dawson
help
yoreself
kansas
which
the
deputy
promptly
proceeded
to
do
by
snapping
a
pair
of
handcuffs
round
the
thick
mcfluke
wrists
whatell
you
trying
to
do
bawled
mcfluke
in
a
rage
i
ai
done
nothing

ca
prove
i
done
nothing

shut
up
interrupted
kansas
casey
giving
the
handcuffs
an
expert
twitch
that
wrenched
a
groan
out
of
mcfluke
proving
anything
takes
time
we
got
time
you
got
time
what
more
do
you
want
the
efficient
deputy
towed
the
round
the
bar
and
out
into
the
barroom
he
faced
him
about
in
front
of
jake
rule
the
sheriff
fixed
him
with
a
grim
stare
what
did
you
try
to
run
for
mac
he
demanded
i
had
business
outdoors
grumbled
mcfluke
what
kind
of
business

wherever

hurry

while

door
and
thompson
saying

through

window

mcfluke
tone

said
the
sheriff
to

who
in
company
with
everyone
else
in
the
room
had
crowded
round
the
sheriff
and
the
prisoner

stranger

lanpher
said
the
sheriff
how
did
the
murderer
get
away
through
the
window
was
the
prompt
reply
of
the
manager
the
sheriff
asked
harpe
coffin
tweezy
and
the
others
who
had
been
present
at
the
killing
for
their
versions
in
every
case
each
had
seen
with
thompson
the
evidence
was
overwhelmingly
against
the
but
he
a
glint
of
fear
in
his
hard
blue
eyes
stuck
to
his
original
statement
swearing
that
all
men
were
liars
and
he
alone
was
telling
the
truth
racey
standing
a
little
back
from
the
crowd
pulled
out
his
but
his
fingers
must
have
been
all
thumbs
at
the
moment
for
he
dropped
it
on
the
floor
he
stooped
to
retrieve
it
the
movement
brought
his
eyes
within
a
yard
of
the
body
of
dale
and
now
he
saw
that
which
he
had
not
previously
taken
note
of
an
abrasion
across
the
knuckles
of
dale
right
hand
not
only
that
but
the
hand
which
was
lying
over
the
left
hand
on
the
body
breast
showed
an
odd
lumpiness
at
the
knuckles
of
the
first
and
second
fingers
racey
stuffed
his
into
his
vest
pocket
and
knelt
beside
the
body
it
was
cold
of
course
but
had
not
yet
completely
stiffened
he
laid
the
two
hands
side
by
side
and
compared
them
the
left
hand
was
as
it
should
be
no
lumpiness
bruises
or
any
discolouration
other
than
grime
but
now
that
the
two
hands
were
side
by
side
the
difference
in
the
right
hand
was
most
apparent
certainly
it
was
badly
bruised
across
the
knuckles
and
the
skin
was
broken
too
furthermore
there
was
that
odd
lumpiness
about
the
knuckles
of
the
first
and
second
fingers
a
lumpiness
that
gave
the
knuckles
almost
the
appearance
of
being
double
he
picked
up
the
dead
hand
and
gingerly
fingered
the
lumpy
knuckles
then
in
a
flash
of
thought
it
came
to
him
the
hand
was
broken
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
across
the
room
and
as
it
chanced
he
looked
across
the
packed
shoulders
and
between
the
peering
heads
of
the
crowd
straight
into
the
face
of
mcfluke
and
the
black
eye
adorning
that
face
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
side
of
the
sheriff
can
i
ask
a
question
said
he
to
the
officer
shore
nodded
the
sheriff
many
as
you
like
thompson
racey
said
but
watching
mcfluke
the
while
did
dale
have
any
trouble
here
with
anybody
besides
the
stranger
not
as
i
know
of
came
the
reply
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
did
have
any
fuss
with
anybody
spoke
up
luke
tweezy
i
was
talking
to
thompson
racey
reminded
the
lawyer
when
i
want
to
ask
you
any
questions
i
let
you
know
huh
luke
contented
himself
with
grunting
and
subsided
no
fuss
thompson
resumed
racey
nary
a
fuss
and
you
was
here
alla
time
dale
was
here
i
was
here
before
dale
come
and
i
was
still
here
when
dale
went
away
in
the
same
room
with
him
in
this
room
yeah
in
the
same
room
with
him
alla
time
shore
then
if
dale
had
had
a
riot
with
anybody
else
but
the
stranger
man
you
knowed
it
you
betcha
he
did
have
no
trouble
only
with
the
stranger
did
anybody
else
have
any
trouble
with
anybody
while
you
was
here
at
this
thompson
frowned
where
were
racey
questions
leading
him
was
it
a
trap
knowing
racey
as
he
did
he
feared
the
worst
he
would
have
liked
to
leave
the
questioned
unanswered
but
this
was
impossible
as
it
was
he
was
delaying
his
answer
longer
than
good
sense
warranted
both
jake
rule
and
kansas
casey
were
staring
at
him
fixedly
racey
regarded
him
steadily
a
slight
and
sinister
smile
lurking
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
well
prompted
racey
you
oughta
be
able
to
tell
us
whether
there
was
any
other
fights
while
you
was
here
they
was
plunged
thompson
everything
was
salubrious
till
dale
started
his
battle
and
when
did
you
get
here
pursued
racey
oh
i
been
here
all
night
and
you
dunno
of
any
other
brush
except
the
one
between
dale
and
the
stranger
i
done
said
so
forty
times
thompson
declared
peevishly
how
many
times
have
i
got
ta
repeat
it
as
many
times
as
yo
asked
put
in
the
sheriff
sharply
didja
see
anybody
get
hurt
have
a
accident
or
something
while
you
were
here
thompson
racey
bored
on
thompson
shook
an
impatient
head
nobody
got
hurt
or
had
a
accident
then
said
racey
turning
suddenly
on
mcfluke
how
did
you
get
that
black
eye
chapter
xxi
gone
away
mcfluke
eyes
flickered
at
the
question
his
body
appeared
to
sink
inward
then
he
straightened
and
flung
back
his
wide
shoulders
and
glowered
at
racey
dawson
i
ran
into
a
door
this
morning
said
the
in
a
tone
of
the
utmost
confidence
oh
you
ran
into
a
door
did
you
racey
observed
sweetly
and
what
particular
door
did
you
run
into
the
front
door
that
one
racey
indicated
the
door
of
the
barroom
that
one
we
just
take
a
look
at
that
door
accompanied
by
the
deeply
interested
sheriff
who
was
beginning
to
sniff
his
quarry
like
the
old
bloodhound
he
was
racey
crossed
to
the
barroom
door
he
looked
at
the
door
he
looked
at
the
sheriff
the
sheriff
looked
only
at
the
door
door
opened
back
flat
against
the
wall
mac
said
the
sheriff
was
she
like
this
when
you
ran
into
her
course
not
was
the
heated
reply
she
was
swingin
open
racey
squatted
down
on
the
floor
lookit
here
sheriff
the
sheriff
stooped
and
regarded
the
wooden
wedge
under
the
door
that
jammed
it
fast
racey
drew
a
finger
across
the
top
of
the
wedge
he
held
up
the
for
the
sheriff
inspection
the
tip
was
black
with
the
dust
of
weeks
that
door
has
been
wedged
back
all
this
hot
weather
said
racey
gently
look
at
the
dust
under
the
door
on
both
sides
of
the
wedge
too
bet
that
wedge
ai
been
out
of
place
for
a
month
softly
as
he
spoke
mcfluke
heard
you
i
tell
you
that
door
was
opened
this
mornin
i
hit
my
head
on
it
ask
all
ask
anybody
jack
lookit
here
i
did
see
you
hit
yore
head
on
the
door
interrupted
jack
harpe
maybe
you
did
i
dunno
racey
raised
a
quick
head
as
jack
harpe
spoke
quite
plainly
he
saw
jack
harpe
accompany
his
words
with
a
slight
lowering
of
his
left
eyelid
racey
glanced
at
mcfluke
he
saw
the
defiant
expression
depart
from
the
mcfluke
countenance
and
a
look
of
unmistakable
relief
take
its
place
racey
dropped
his
head
the
sheriff
was
speaking
mac
he
was
saying
yo
lyin
yo
lyin
as
fast
as
a
hoss
can
trot
you
never
got
yore
black
eye
on
this
door
i
dunno
why
sayin
you
did
but
i
gon
na
find
out
till
you
wo
have
far
to
go
to
find
out
struck
in
racey
dawson
i
know
how
he
got
his
black
eye
how
demanded
the
sheriff
his
grizzled
eyebrows
drawing
together
dale
gave
it
to
him
was
the
answer
pat
and
pithy
he
did
not
the
began
to
roar
instantly
and
had
to
be
quieted
by
kansas
casey
when
order
was
restored
racey
explained
his
deductions
the
sheriff
listened
in
silence
then
he
went
to
the
body
of
the
dead
man
and
examined
the
bruised
and
broken
right
hand
i
tellin
you
declared
racey
with
finality
he
hit
somebody
when
he
broke
that
hand
he
might
broke
it
when
he
fell
after
being
shot
put
in
luke
tweezy
the
sheriff
shook
his
head
he
could
fall
hard
enough
to
break
them
bones
as
bad
as
that
it
like
racey
says
question
is
who
did
he
hit
mcfluke
eye
and
mcfluke
lies
are
a
good
enough
answer
for
me
you
have
to
prove
it
snapped
luke
tweezy
i
expect
we
do
that
luke
the
sheriff
said
calmly
have
you
agreed
on
a
verdict
judge
we
had
replied
dolan
we
was
about
satisfied
that
a
plain
by
a
person
unknown
was
as
good
as
any
but
i
expect
now
change
it
to
murder
the
recommendation
that
mcfluke
be
arrested
on
suspicion
whadda
you
say
boys
shore
chorussed
the
boys
and
hiccuped
like
so
many
bullfrogs
not
the
shlide
suggested
one
bright
spirit
an
him
right
now
an
him
after
shupper
it
cool
no
vetoed
dolan
it
ca
be
done
he
got
ta
be
indicted
and
held
for
the
grand
jury
at
piegan
city
i
ai
allowed
to
try
murder
cases
bad
mourned
the
bright
spirit
and
refused
to
be
comforted
can
i
take
him
now
judge
inquired
chuck
morgan
referring
to
the
dead
man
any
time
nodded
dolan
racey
dawson
whose
eyes
that
day
were
missing
nothing
saw
that
jack
harpe
was
looking
steadily
at
luke
tweezy
luke
nod
was
barely
perceptible
where
were
you
thinking
of
taking
him
chuck
was
tweezy
query
moccasin
spring
chuck
replied
laconically
i
would
if
i
were
you
said
luke
tweezy
better
save
trouble
by
taking
him
to
yore
house
it
was
coming
now
the
answer
to
one
puzzle
at
least
racey
was
sure
of
it
he
was
not
disappointed
and
why
had
i
better
take
him
to
my
house
demanded
chuck
because
the
ranch
at
moccasin
spring
do
belong
to
the
dale
family
any
more
tweezy
explained
smoothly
dale
has
turned
over
the
place
to
lanpher
and
me
it
a
damn
lie
declared
chuck
tweezy
smiled
he
was
a
lawyer
not
a
fighter
names
signified
nothing
in
his
greasy
life
it
no
lie
he
tossed
back
you
know
lanpher
and
me
bought
the
mortgage
on
the
dale
place
from
the
marysville
bank
the
mortgage
is
due
in
a
couple
of
days
dale
did
have
the
money
to
satisfy
the
mortgage
we
was
gon
na
foreclose
in
order
to
save
trouble
all
round
he
made
the
ranch
over
to
us
you
mean
to
tell
me
dale
did
that
just
to
save
trouble
burst
out
racey
just
because
he
liked
you
two
fellers
and
wanted
to
make
it
as
easy
as
possible
for
you
aw
hell
tweezy
aw
hell
again
yo
as
poor
a
liar
as
yore
mcfluke
tweezy
smiled
once
more
and
drew
forth
a
long
and
shiny
from
the
inner
pocket
of
his
vest
from
the
he
extracted
a
document
which
document
he
handed
to
sheriff
rule
read
her
off
jake
requested
luke
tweezy
the
sheriff
read
aloud
the
lines
of
writing
shorn
of
the
impressive
terms
so
beloved
of
law
and
lawyers
the
document
set
forth
that
in
consideration
of
being
allowed
to
retain
all
his
wagons
and
household
goods
instead
of
merely
the
fixed
number
of
cattle
horses
and
wagons
and
those
specified
household
articles
exempt
from
seizure
under
the
law
dale
voluntarily
released
to
the
mortgagers
without
the
formality
of
foreclosure
proceedings
the
mortgaged
property
comprising
six
hundred
and
forty
acres
as
described
hereinafter
etcetera
the
document
was
signed
by
dale
and
witnessed
by
doc

and
honey
hoke
the
sheriff
held
the
paper
out
to
chuck
morgan

chuck

mighty
busy
just

no
uncertain
tones
if

dirty
work
to

you
do
it
yoreself
yo
began
the
manager
and
stopped
suddenly
what
was
you
gon
na
say
alicran
voice
cut
sharply
across
the
general
silence
lanpher
controlled
himself
by
an
effort
or
perhaps
it
was
not
such
an
effort
after
all
it
may
have
been
that
he
remembered
the
object
lesson
of
the
severed
branch
of
the
wild
currant
bush
at
any
rate
he
did
not
pursue
further
the
subject
of
the
cowboys
cast
as
an
eviction
gang
i
talk
to
you
later
alicran
said
he
in
a
tone
he
strove
to
make
grimly
menacing
but
which
actually
imposed
upon
no
one
least
of
all
the
truculent
alicran
we
wo
need
yore
boys
lanpher
said
racey
the
sheriff
will
attend
to
it
lookit
here

said
judge
dolan
slouching
to
the
front
of
the
crowd
are
you
gon
na
run
them
women
off
thataway
after
here
the
judge
jerked
his
head
backward
in
the
direction
of
the
body
why
not
tweezy
demanded
sulkily
we
got
a
right
to
it
do
always
pay
to
stand
on
our
rights
luke
suggested
the
judge
i
go
a
easy
if
i
was
you
you
ai
me
said
tweezy
rudely
which
is
something
i
got
ta
be
grateful
for
the
judge
returned
to
the
charge
but
alla
same
luke
i
scratch
my
head
and
think
how
this
here
is
gon
na
look
here
dale
gives
you
this
paper
and
a
hour
later
he
cashed
of
course
it
looks
like
his
signature
and
you
got
witnesses
who
say
it
his
signature
but
the
judge
paused
and
gravely
contemplated
luke
tweezy
i
tell
you
what
it
looks
like
to
me
announced
racey
in
a
loud
unsympathetic
tone
the
whole
deal
too
smooth
she
so
smooth
she
slick
like
a
counterfeit
dollar
you
and
lanpher
are
a
couple
of
damn
thieves
tweezy
but
the
sheriff
gun
was
out
first
none
of
that
lanpher
he
cautioned
they
ai
gon
na
be
no
lockin
horns
that
goes
for
you
too
racey
i
do
need
to
pull
any
gun
racey
declared
contemptuously
all
i
have
to
use
is
my
fingers
on
that
feller
he
never
went
after
his
gun
till
he
seen
you
pull
yores
he
ai
got
any
nerve
that
all
that
the
matter
with
him
lanpher
snarled
curses
at
this
he
yearned
for
the
daredevil
courage
sufficient
to
risk
all
on
a
single
throw
by
pulling
his
gun
and
sending
a
bullet
smack
through
the
scornful
face
of
racey
dawson
but
it
was
precisely
as
racey
said
he
did
not
have
the
nerve
with
drinks
under
his
belt
he
undoubtedly
would
have
made
an
attempt
to
clear
his
honour
but
he
was
not
carrying
the
requisite
amount
of
liquor
lanpher
snarled
another
string
of
oaths
if
i
did
have
my
right
arm
in
a
sling
he
began
i
guess
interrupted
the
sheriff
this
will
be
about
all
lanpher
yore
hoss
is
outside
git
on
and
git
out
chapter
xxii
a
check
lookit
here
judge
said
racey
earnestly
do
you
mean
to
say
gon
na
let
the
sheriff
serve
them
eviction
papers
judge
dolan
elevated
his
feet
upon
his
desk
and
tilted
back
his
chair
before
replying
racey
he
said
teetering
gently
i
got
ta
do
what
the
law
says
in
this
thing
then
yo
gon
na
sic
the
sheriff
on
huh
i
ai
doin
no
sicin
not
me
luke
tweezy
the
boy
you
mean
but
the
law
makes
you
back
up
luke
in
this
case
it
does
then
it
a
helluva
law
that
lets
a
feller
take
away
the
home
of
two
women
they
lots
of
times
observed
dolan
judicially
when
i
think
she
a
helluva
law
too
but
what
you
gon
na
do
under
the
law
one
man
word
is
as
good
as
another
till
he
proved
a
liar
and
two
men
words
are
better
than
one
and
so
on
and
so
far
nobody
proved
doc
coffin
and
honey
hoke
and
luke
tweezy
are
liars
of
course
we
know
they
are
protested
racey
not
legally
you
got
ta
remember
that
knowing
a
man
is
a
liar
is
one
thing
and
being
able
to
prove
it
is
another
breed
of
cat
then
they
ai
nothing
to
be
done
short
of
rubbing
out
lanpher
and
tweezy
and
what
good
would
wiping
out
either
or
both
of
them
do
beyond
lanpher
and
tweezy
are
their
heirs
and
assigns
whoever
they
may
be
you
ca
go
down
the
line
and
abolish
all
i
not
grumbled
racey
of
course
not
it
ai
reasonable
you
do
wan
na

like
a
bufflehead
in

bet
you
need
every
single
one
of
if
you
wan
na
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
business
under
the
circumstances
then
what
yore
advice
judge
i
ai
got
no
particular
advice
to
give
replied
dolan
promptly
i
a
judge
not
a
lawyer
but
i
free
to
say
even
if
i
was
a
lawyer
i
dunno
exactly
what
i
do
or
where
i
begin
racey
nodded
he
did
see
exactly
where
to
begin
either
lookit
judge
he
said
at
last
ca
you
sort
of
delay
the
proceedin
for
a
while
i
do
what
i
can
assented
dolan
but
i
ca
keep
it
up
forever
i
sworn
to
obey
the
law
and
see
that
it
is
obeyed
and
if
luke
tweezy
paper
ca
be
proved
a
forgery
certain
and
soon
they
only
one
thing
for
me
to
do
and
one
thing
for
the
dales
to
do
i
sorry
but
that
the
way
it
stands
under
the
law
it
was
then
that
the
clicked
and
one
entered
without
knocking
it
was
luke
tweezy
beyond
the
merest
flicker
of
a
glance
he
did
not
acknowledge
the
presence
of
racey
dawson
he
nodded
perfunctorily
to
dolan
mornin
judge
said
he
are
the
papers
ready
for
the
sheriff
yet
not
yet
luke
not
yet
dolan
assured
him
blandly
i
ai
had
time
to
get
at
when
you
gon
na
get
at
soon
as
i
get
time
but
lookit
here
judge
we
bein
delayed
we
wan
na
get
the
dales
off
their
ranch
soon
as
we
can
off
ranch
is
shore
the
truth
struck
in
racey
you
do
tell
it
sometimes
do
you
luke
but
luke
tweezy
was
not
to
be
drawn
that
morning
he
focussed
his
eyes
and
attention
steadily
on
judge
dolan
we
wan
na
take
possession
soon
as
we
can
persisted
luke
tweezy
shore
you
do
said
the
judge
heartily
no
reason
why
you
wan
na
as
i
know
of
if
you
ca
see
yore
way
to
getting
at
this
business
within
a
reasonable
time
i
have
to
sue
out
a
mandatory
injunction
against
you
judge
and
dolan
smiled
wintrily
what
judge
are
you
figuring
on
to
grant
this
injunction
luke
tweezy
was
silent
you
do
expect
me
to
grant
a
mandatory
injunction
against
myself
do
you
pursued
dolan
i
can
go
to
judge
allison
at
marysville
or
to
piegan
city
and
i
guess
i
guess
not
interrupted
the
judge
judge
allison
as
you
know
is
a
federal
judge
and
these
here
eviction
proceedin
are
territorial
business
and
furthermore
lem
me
point
out
that
the
piegan
city
court
ai
got
any
jurisdiction
in
this
case
why
not
because
the
case
ai
come
to
a
hearing
yet
that
why
you
oughta
know
that
luke
yo
a
lawyer
alla
same
began
luke
alla
same
nothing
declared
judge
dolan
eviction
proceedin
have
been
started
and
if
you
do
have
any
luck
in
getting
them
women
off
the
place
then
you
can
apply
to
this
court
for
redress
i
set
a
date
for
a
hearing
the
hearing
if
you
got
a
notion
in
yore
numskull
that
i
ai
doing
you
right
you
can
apply
to
the
piegan
city
court
for
all
the
mandatory
injunctions
you
feel
like
and
be
to
you
is
they
any
further
business
you
got
with
me
luke
or
any
more
points
of
law
you
wan
na
be
instructed
on
if
they
ai
here
you
there
the
door
and
right
yonder
is
outside
luke
tweezy
departed
abruptly
dolan
laughed
harshly
as
the
door
slammed
he
ca
bluff
me
the
chucklehead
he
knew
he
could
sue
out
a
mandatory
injunction
yet
knew
it
damn
well
but
he
did
think
i
knew
it
damn
his
ornery
soul
oh
he
slick
luke
tweezy
is
said
racey
dawson
but
like
most
slick
gents
he
thinks
everybody
else
is
a
fool
he
makes
a
mistake
once
in
a
while
grunted
dolan
at
which
racey
looked
up
sharply
a
mistake
he
repeated
an
idea
i
wonder
if
he
has
made
any
mistake
who
ai
nodded
dolan
luke
made
plenty
i
bet
i
dunno
about
plenty
doubted
racey
one
would
be
enough
dolan
rasped
a
hand
across
his
stubbly
chin
one
would
be
enough
he
admitted
if
you
could
find
the
one
it
would
have
to
be
a
mistake
having
to
do
with
this
particular
case
either
would
it
not
necessarily
of
course
it
would
be
better
to
trip
him
up
on
this
case
but
if
you
can
get
hold
of
something
else
luke
has
done
that
can
be
proved
anyways
shady
it
would
be
four
aces
and
the
joker
luke
would
have
to
pull
in
his
horns
about
this
mortgage
and
if
i
know
luke
he
do
it
he
got
nerve
but
it
ai
cold
enough
nor
witless
enough
to
go
up
against
the
shore
thing
if
only
mcfluke
would
talk
he
knows
the
ins
and
outs
of
this
business
dolan
nodded
shore
as
yo
a
foot
high
dale
gave
him
that
black
eye
and
shore
as
a
foot
high
he
downed
dale
i
guess
likely
but
circumstantial
evidence
is
amazing
queer
you
ca
ever
tell
how
the
jury
gon
na
take
it
but
anyway
we
got
mcfluke
and
he
do
to
start
in
on
entered
then
kansas
casey
with
a
serious
face
mcfluke
has
sloped
said
he
without
preliminary
what
cried
judge
dolan
but
it
was
characteristic
of
racey
dawson
that
he
did
not
say
what
he
asked
how
because
the
jail
was
burned
down
said
kansas
you
know
we
had
to
put
him
in
yore
warehouse
judge
as
the
next
strongest
place
and
they
dug
him
out
him
out
thus
judge
dolan
that
what
they
did
who
again
judge
dolan
if
i
knowed
who
they
was
kansas
replied
i
dump
just
too
quick
way
i
know
it
a
is
because
the
job
of
diggin
is
bigger
than
a
job
we
go
look
into
this
dolan
exclaimed
wrathfully
and
reached
for
his
hat
he
never
been
pulled
out
of
the
calaboose
so
easy
said
kansas
as
he
led
dolan
and
racey
up
the
street
to
the
rear
of
the
dolan
warehouse
but
yore
foundation
logs
ai
sunk
more
six
inches
and
diggin
under
and
in
was
a
cinch
but
why
did
you
handcuff
this
sport
to
a
roof
stanchion
inside
demanded
the
judge
we
did
man
we
did
we
got
a
log
chain
and
the
biggest
pair
of
handcuffs
in
our
stock
and
we
ironed
mcfluke
by
the
ankles
to
a
stanchion
in
the
middle
of
the
warehouse
besides
that
his
hands
was
handcuffed
and
no
matter
how
he
stretched
he
could
reach
nothing
we
seen
to
that
but
my
gawd
hownell
did
they
have
time
to
file
through
that
log
chain
or
them
cuffs
a
log
chain
ai
made
of
wire
an
them
cuffs
is
all
special
steel
they
did
file
neither
the
chain
nor
the
cuffs
explained
kansas
wearily
they
unlocked
the
cuffs
unlocked
huh
where
they
get
the
key
lose
one
of
yores
did
yuh
ours
is
all
safe
they
must
had
a
key
anyway
there
the
handcuffs
wide
open
when
i
found
mcfluke
gone
this
mornin
dolan
pulled
out
his
watch
nine
said
he
when
did
you
first
find
mac
was
gone
kansas
when
i
took
his
breakfast
in
five
minutes
ago
howcome
you
went
to
the
warehouse
so
late
well
said
kansas
somewhat
shamefacedly
we
did
lock
him
up
in
the
warehouse
till
one
this
morning
and
i
figured
a
extra
sleep
would
do
him
any
harm
or
a
extra
sleep
would
do
yoreself
any
harm
neither
huh
maybe
i
did
sleep
later
than
usual
admitted
kansas
i
guess
you
did
said
dolan
i
guess
you
did
and
jake
too
told
anybody
else
about
this
only
jake
they
had
left
the
street
while
they
talked
and
walked
down
the
long
side
wall
of
the
warehouse
now
they
turned
the
corner
and
saw
heaped
against
a
foundation
log
a
pile
of
freshly
dug
dirt
beyond
the
dirt
pile
gaped
the
mouth
of
a
hole
leading
beneath
the
log
the
hole
was
quite
large
enough
for
an
man
to
crawl
through
without
difficulty
judge
dolan
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
peered
into
the
hole
then
he
eased
down
into
it
headfirst
and
pawed
his
way
through
that
what
you
get
for
not
walking
in
by
the
front
door
in
the
first
place
kansas
grinned
racey
root
hog
or
die
feller
root
hog
or
die
swearing
under
his
breath
kansas
went
to
ground
like
a
badger
his
broad
shoulders
did
not
scrape
the
sides
of
the
hall
observing
which
racey
knew
that
it
must
have
been
an
easy
matter
for
mcfluke
to
crawl
through
for
the
shoulders
wide
as
they
were
were
not
as
broad
as
those
of
kansas
casey
by
a
good
inch
and
a
half
that
hole
is
four
or
five
inches
wider
than
necessary
ruminated
racey
preparing
to
follow
the
deputy
i
wonder
why
yep
i
shore
wonder
why
here
they
are
in
a
harris
of
a
hurry
and
they
take
time
to
make
a
hole
big
enough
for
two
men
almost
maybe
they
robbed
the
warehouse
too
he
suggested
as
much
to
dolan
when
he
joined
the
latter
within
no
said
dolan
sweeping
with
a
glance
the
stacks
of
cases
and
crates
that
half
filled
the
single
floor
of
the
warehouse
no
i
do
think
they
anything
missing
who
steal
truck
like
this
here
anyway
it
ai
valuable
enough
where
jake
kansas
i
left
him
here
when
i
went
after
you
replied
the
deputy
guess
this
is
him
he
added
as
the
front
door
opened
it
was
the
sheriff
he
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
advanced
toward
the
little
group
gathered
about
the
stanchion
this
is
a
great
note
jake
said
dolan
eyeing
the
sheriff
severely
ca
you
make
out
to
hang
onto
yore
prisoners
no
more
hang
onto
hell
snapped
back
the
sheriff
short
of
sleeping
in
here
with
him
i
done
all
that
could
be
expected
i
put
shorty
rumbold
on
as
guard
and
shorty
where
shorty
went
to
the
starlight
for
a
drink
he
be
along
in
a
minute
maybe
he
went
to
sleep
suggested
dolan
not
shorty
denied
the
sheriff
with
a
decisive
shake
of
his
head
i
used
shorty
before
he
do
go
to
sleep
on
duty
shorty
do
here
he
is
now
entered
then
shorty
rumbold
a
tall
man
with
a
twinkling
eye
and
a
square
chin
shorty
said
dolan
jake
says
he
put
you
on
guard
here
last
night
not
here
said
shorty
always
painfully
meticulous
as
to
facts
outside
where
outside
just
outside
i
sat
on
the
doorstep
all
night
and
did
you
go
round
to
the
back
once
even
i
did
think
they
was
any
use
they
no
door
in
the
back
and
the
logs
are
forty
inches
through
some
of
i
never
thought
of
gopherin
under
this
away
i
guess
the
sheriff
did
either
said
dolan
with
a
glance
of
strong
disapproval
at
the
sheriff
you
did
hear
anything
huh
yo
shore
of
that
shore
i
am
if
i
heard
anything
i
scouted
round
to
see
what
made
the
noise
maybe
you
went
to
sleep
not
me
the
twinkle
in
shorty
eyes
was
replaced
by
a
frosty
stare
i
do
sleep
on
duty
judge
that
what
the
sheriff
said
shorty
but
hownell
they
could
dig
that
tunnel
and
not
make
noise
i
do
see
i
do
either
shorty
rumbold
admitted
frankly
but
i
hear
a
single
suspicious
sound
either
inside
or
outside
the
jail
the
whole
night
did
you
hear
any
noise
asked
racey
dawson
only
when
some
drunk
gents
had
a
argument
out
in
front
of
the
dance
hall
you
could
help
hearin
they
made
noise
enough
to
hear
a
mile
how
long
did
the
argument
last
oh
maybe
a
hour
a
long
time
for
a
plain
argument
without
any
shooting
did
they
call
each
other
any
fighting
names
pressed
on
racey
plenty
and
no
shooting
nary
a
shot
did
that
hit
you
as
kind
of
odd
it
did
at
the
time
sort
of
recognize
any
of
the
voices
shorty
rumbold
shook
his
head
they
was
all
too
hoarse
an
loud
that
the
how
of
it
judge
said
racey
to
dolan
that
why
shorty
did
hear
any
sounds
of
diggin
the
drunk
gents
a
rowing
together
for
a
long
time
like
that
without
any
shooting
proves
they
were
doing
it
on
purpose
to
keep
shorty
from
hearing
anything
else
the
sheriff
swore
i
heard
them
fellers
too
he
said
they
woke
me
up
with
their
bellerin
and
i
had
a
job
gettin
to
sleep
again
i
guess
racey
right
i
guess
he
is
assented
the
judge
now
we
know
how
they
managed
that
part
of
it
where
did
they
get
the
key
to
open
the
cuffs
kansas
says
you
ai
lost
any
keys
jake
we
got
all
every
one
i
do
believe
they
used
a
key
them
handcuff
locks
was
picked
picked
picked
after
kansas
went
for
you
i
found
these
here
on
the
floor
here
he
produced
from
a
pocket
a
bent
and
twisted
piece
of
and
a
steel
needle
that
a
number
six
needle
observed
the
sheriff
who
invariably
scented
clues
in
the
most
unpromising
objects
and
the
point
broke
off
number
six
is
a
common
size
said
racey
most
stores
carry
and
if
the
point
did
get
broke
off
wigglin
round
inside
the
lock
it
would
be
a
wonder
still
it
would
take
a
mighty
good
man
to
open
them
locks
with
only
and
a
said
the
sheriff
hurriedly
a
expert
you
bet
it
do
matter
whether
he
was
a
expert
or
not
said
dolan
he
opened
them
and
the
prisoner
has
skedaddled
that
the
main
thing
jake
how
about
trailin
him
how
they
tracks
a
few
of
leadin
from
the
pile
of
dirt
straight
to
the
hard
ground
in
front
of
the
stage
corrals
beyond
there
they
ai
any
tracks
trail
how
you
gon
na
trail
i
dunno
replied
dolan
promptly
passing
the
buck
yo
the
sheriff
she
yore
job
you
got
ta
do
out
the
five
men
dolan
and
the
sheriff
arguing
steadily
went
out
into
the
street
racey
walked
thoughtfully
in
the
rear
he
was
revolving
in
his
mind
what
the
sheriff
had
said
about
an
expert
of
course
it
had
been
an
expert
and
experts
in
in
the
cattle
country
are
few
and
far
between
racey
decided
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
him
to
have
a
little
talk
on
with
peaches
austin
not
that
he
suspected
the
excellent
peaches
of
having
picked
those
locks
but
peaches
knew
who
had
oh
most
certainly
peaches
knew
who
had
chapter
xxiii
taking
fences
peaches
peaches
austin
standing
at
the
starlight
bar
was
raising
a
glass
to
his
lips
but
at
the
greeting
he
set
down
the
liquor
untasted
turned
his
head
and
looked
into
the
face
of
racey
dawson
whatsa
matter
peaches
inquired
racey
you
do
look
glad
to
see
me
i
ai
peaches
said
frankly
i
do
give
a
damn
about
you
i
sorry
grieved
racey
edging
closer
to
the
gambler
peaches
yo
breaking
my
heart
with
them
cruel
words
at
this
the
bartender
removed
hastily
to
the
other
end
of
the
bar
he
sensed
he
knew
not
what
and
he
felt
instead
of
curiosity
a
lively
fear
racey
dawson
was
the
most
unexpected
sport
peaches
looked
nervously
at
racey
a
desperate
resolve
began
to
formulate
itself
in
the
brain
of
peaches
austin
his
right
arm
tensed
slowly
his
hand
slid
toward
the
edge
of
the
bar
why
no
said
racey
who
had
never
been
more
than
at
that
moment
i
would
do
anything
we
all
be
sorry
for
peaches
that
is
all
of
us
but
you
yoreself
you
might
not
be
sorry
or
else
this
was
threatening
language
plain
and
simple
but
it
was
no
bluff
peaches
knew
that
racey
meant
every
word
he
said
peaches
right
hand
moved
no
farther
peaches
said
racey
le
go
where
we
can
have
a
private
talk
all
right
peaches
acquiesced
shortly
and
left
the
saloon
with
racey
on
the
sidewalk
they
were
joined
by
swing
tunstall
the
latter
fell
into
step
on
the
other
side
of
peaches
austin
is
he
coming
too
queried
the
gambler
with
a
marked
absence
of
cordiality
in
expression
and
tone
he
is
answered
racey
i
thought
this
talk
was
gon
na
be
private
it
is
only
the
three
of
us
we
would
think
of
letting
anybody
else
horn
in
you
can
rest
easy
peaches
we
take
care
of
you
the
gambler
did
doubt
it
his
wicked
heart
sank
accordingly
he
knew
that
he
had
been
a
bad
bad
boy
and
he
conceived
the
notion
that
nemesis
was
rolling
up
her
sleeves
all
to
his
ultimate
prejudice
he
perceived
in
front
of
the
dance
hall
doc
coffin
and
honey
hoke
and
plucked
up
heart
at
once
but
racey
saw
the
pair
at
the
same
time
and
said
twitching
peaches
by
the
sleeve
we
turn
off
here
i
guess
peaches
turned
perforce
and
accompanied
racey
and
swing
into
the
narrow
space
between
the
express
office
and
a
log
house
when
they
came
out
into
the
open
racey
obliqued
to
the
left
and
piloted
his
companion
to
a
large
log
that
lay
among
empty
tin
cans
almost
directly
in
the
rear
of
and
about
fifty
yards
away
from
warehouse
here
a
good
place
said
racey
indicating
the
log
good
seats
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
nobody
round
to
bother
us
sidown
peaches
peaches
sat
as
requested
the
two
friends
seated
themselves
one
on
his
either
hand
racey
laughed
gently
doc
coffin
and
honey
looked
kind
of
surprised
to
see
you
with
us
he
remarked
with
enjoyment
did
they
peaches
i
did
notice
lied
peaches
it
do
matter
nodded
racey
see
that
pile
of
dirt
over
against
the
back
wall
of
dolan
warehouse
peaches
i
ai
blind
no
then
maybe
you
heard
how
and
why
it
come
to
be
dug
and
all
i
ai
deaf
neither
racey
smiled
his
approval
i
always
said
you
had
all
yore
senses
except
the
common
variety
peaches
hop
ahead
with
yore
private
talk
grunted
the
badgered
gambler
gim
me
time
gim
me
time
it
do
cost
anything
whadda
you
think
of
that
hole
peaches
good
big
hole
replied
peaches
conservatively
too
big
that
is
too
big
for
just
mcfluke
or
for
any
other
feller
the
size
of
mcfluke
what
of
it
do
be
in
a
hurry
peaches
and
you
last
longer
did
you
know
mac
handcuffs
were
picked
open
how
picked
open
whoever
opened
did
use
a
key
racey
explained
they
were
picked
open
with
a
piece
of
and
a
i
heard
that
i
thought
maybe
so
but
did
you
ever
think
that
a
feller
has
got
to
have
a
good
and
clever
pair
of
hands
to
pick
a
lock
with
only
a
and
all
that
stands
to
reason
admitted
peaches
there
ca
be
a
great
many
fellers
like
that
no
not
many
not
around
here
anyway
you
find
such
sports
in
the
big
cities
mainly
yeah
chipped
in
swing
tunstall
staring
hard
at
peaches
i
bet
you
a
hundred
even
they
ai
more
than
one
or
two
such
experts
in
the
whole
territory
whadda
you
think
peaches
inquired
racey
swing
may
be
right
said
peaches
preserving
a
wooden
countenance
i
dunno
shore
about
that
sharply
shore
i
shore
why
not
you
looked
sort
of
funny
when
you
said
it
well
then
peaches
go
back
to
our
hole
yonder
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
fellers
hustlin
to
dig
it
and
without
any
too
much
time
would
make
it
any
bigger
than
they
had
to
how
about
it
huh
guess
so
maybe
aw
right
i
told
you
a
while
ago
the
hole
was
too
big
for
mcfluke
why
was
it
made
too
big
for
mcfluke
damfino
so
as
to
let
in
the
feller
who
was
to
pick
open
mac
handcuffs
well
what
does
that
prove
it
proves
that
the
expert
who
set
mac
loose
was
a
bigger
man
across
the
shoulders
than
mcfluke
now
who
all
around
here
besides
kansas
casey
is
wider
across
the
shoulders
than
mcfluke
peaches
wrinkled
his
forehead
i
dunno
he
said
after
a
space
think
again
peaches
think
again
do
you
know
anybody
bigger
sidewise
than
mcfluke
i
do
mac
the
biggest
man
across
the
shoulders
i
ever
seen
good
enough
peaches
i
found
out
what
i
wanted
i
had
a
fair
idea
before
but
now
i
know
i
hear
you
were
acting
boisterious
and
noisy
out
front
of
the
dance
hall
last
night
what
of
it
oh
nothin
nothin
only
i
think
it
over
i
think
everythin
over
good
an
careful
and
after
i
done
that
i
do
what
looked
like
the
best
thing
to
do
under
the
circumstances
that
all
peaches
you
can
go
now
i
think
yore
friends
are
looking
for
you
i
saw
doc
coffin
peekin
round
the
corner
of
the
dance
hall
a
couple
of
times
peaches
arose
and
faced
racey
dawson
and
swing
tunstall
i
he
began
and
stopped
i
prompted
swing
i
what
smiled
racey
speak
right
out
peaches
do
you
care
if
you
do
hurt
our
feelin
they
tough
they
can
stand
it
say
on
yore
mind
but
peaches
did
not
say
what
was
on
his
mind
he
turned
about
and
walked
hurriedly
away
so
it
jack
harpe
who
picked
the
cuffs
murmured
racey
peaches
old
timer
i
did
think
you
be
so
easy
neither
did
i
said
swing
and
him
a
gambler
no
wonder

so
well

raised
a
hand
and
pushed
back
a
lock
of
gray
hair
that
had
fallen
over
one
eye
it
a
forgery
she
said
wretchedly
i
know
it

forgery

would
sign
such
a
paper
i
know
he
would
molly
dale
all
unmindful
of
racey
dawson
sitting
in
a
chair
tilted
back
against
the
wall
slipped
around
the
table
and
slid
her
arm
about
her
mother
waist
there
there
ma
she
soothed
pulling
her
mother
head
against
her
firm
young
shoulder
do
you
fret
it
will
come
out
all
right
you
see
you
must
worry
this
way
ca
you
believe
what
racey
says
try
dear
try
but
unhappy
dale
was
beyond
trying
she
saw
the
home
which
she
had
worked
to
get
and
slaved
to
maintain
taken
from
her
and
herself
and
her
daughter
turned
out
of
doors
there
was
no
help
for
it
there
was
no
hope
the
future
was
she
broke
down
and
wept
oh
oh
she
sobbed
if
only
i
watched
him
closer
that
day
but
i
was
washing
and
i
sort
of
forgot
about
him
for
a
spell
and
when
got
the
clothes
on
the
line
he
was
anywhere
in
sight
and
and
all
my
this
was
too
much
for
racey
dawson
he
got
up
and
went
out
savagely
he
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
strode
to
where
his
horse
stood
in
the
shade
of
a
cottonwood
but
he
did
not
pick
up
the
trailing
reins
for
as
he
reached
the
animal
he
saw
approaching
across
the
flat
the
figures
of
a
horse
and
rider
and
the
man
was
luke
tweezy
with
the
sight
of
dale
tears
fresh
in
his
memory
and
the
rage
engendered
thereby
galvanizing
his
brain
he
went
to
meet
tweezy
howdy
racey
said
the
lawyer
pulling
up
whadda
you
want
demanded
racey
halting
a
scant
yard
from
luke
tweezy
left
leg
i
come
to
see
dale
replied
tweezy
his
leathery
features
wrinkling
in
a
grimace
intended
to
pass
for
a
propitiating
smile
racey
stare
was
venomous
tweezy
he
drawled
i
done
told
you
something
about
admiring
to
see
you
put
these
women
off
this
ranch
did
i
oh
you
was
just
a
hasty
i
understand
that
all
right
done
forgot
all
about
it
so
i
see
so
i
see
i
reminding
you
of
it
after
this
luke
hobble
my
memory
if
i
was
you
then
it
wo
go
straying
off
thisaway
and
get
you
into
trouble
trouble
racey
did
not
deign
to
repeat
he
nodded
simply
i
ai
got
no
gun
explained
the
lawyer
alla
more
easy
for
me
then
you
ca
shoot
back
luke
tweezy
choked
choked
and
he
began
in
a
violent
tone
of
voice
careful
careful
cautioned
racey
promptly
kicking
the
horse
in
the
ribs
there
ladies
in
the
house
you
get
of
yore
tongue
luke
tweezy
obeyed
the
command
literally
for
his
horse
going
into
the
air
with
great
briskness
at
the
impact
of
racey
toe
even
as
the
puncher
had
intended
it
should
he
luke
tweezy
bit
his
tongue
so
hard
that
he
wept
involuntary
tears
of
keenest
anguish
you
stop
that
cussin
resumed
racey
seizing
the
bridle
short
and
yanking
the
bouncing
horse
to
a
standstill
with
a
swerve
and
a
jerk
that
almost
unseated
its
rider
you
be
careful
how
you
talk
you
hop
toad
leggo
that
bridle
yammered
tweezy
almost
distraught
with
anger
his
tongue
pained
him
exquisitely
and
he
was
otherwise
physically
shaken
leggo
that
bridle
i
let
it
go
racey
grated
through
set
teeth
and
he
let
it
go
with
a
backward
flip
to
the
lower
branches
of
the
severe
curb
bit
that
instantly
sent
the
horse
on
its
hind
legs
if
luke
tweezy
had
not
quickwittedly
smacked
the
animal
between
the
ears
with
the
butt
of
his
quirt
it
would
have
continued
the
motion
to
a
backfall
and
rolled
its
rider
out
tough
luck
mourned
racey
sorry
to
observe
that
luke
had
contrived
to
ward
off
an
accident
i
was
expecting
to
see
that
horn
dislocate
yore
latest
meal
if
you
ai
quite
so
set
on
going
to
the
house
you
can
flit
i
wan
na
see
dale
persisted
the
lawyer
in
a
strangled
voice
i
come
to
offer
her
money
i
wan
na
do
her
a
favour
ca
you
understand
i
ca
was
the
frank
reply
i
ca
see
you
doing
anybody
a
favour
or
giving
away
any
money
get
it
was
then
that
the
lawyer
lifted
up
his
voice
and
shouted
aloud
for
dale
undoubtedly
racey
would
have
done
tweezy
a
mischief
had
he
been
given
time
but
unfortunately
molly
dale
came
to
the
rescue
precisely
as
she
had
once
come
to
the
rescue
of
his
partner
in
evil
the
bulldozer
lanpher
as
it
was
racey
had
contrived
to
pull
luke
tweezy
partly
from
the
saddle
when
molly
arrived
and
forced
her
defender
to
release
his
victim
reluctantly
racey
dropped
the
leg
he
held
and
allowed
tweezy
to
come
to
earth
on
his
hands
and
knees
what
do
you
want
inquired
molly
regarding
tweezy
much
as
she
would
have
regarded
a
poisonous
reptile
i
want
to
see
yore
mother
snuffled
tweezy
applying
his
sleeve
to
his
nose
he
had
in
the
mixup
smote
his
swell
fork
with
the
organ
in
question
and
it
had
begun
to
bleed
why
i
want
to
pay
her
money
to
go
away
quietly
said
tweezy
switching
from
his
sleeve
to
his
handkerchief
i
here
she
is
interrupted
molly
tell
her
how
do
said
luke
to
the
widow
i
guess
it
necessary
for
me
to
go
through
a
lot
of
explanations
with
you

what

and
you
know
we
take
possession
just
as
soon
as

this
racey
dawson
made
a
noise
in
his
throat
molly
laid
cool
fingers
on
his
wrist
steady
boy
steady
she
whispered
under
her
breath
despite
the
seriousness
of
the
moment
racey
heart
skipped
a
beat
and
the
pleasantest
shiver
in
the
world
ran
about
his
body
boy
she
had
called
him
boy
her
hand
was
actually
touching
his
own
he
i
do
want
to

luke
after
an
apprehensive
glance
at
racey
dawson

the
sheriff
is
going
to
serve
those
eviction
papers

warning
pressure
on

his
mouth
to

racey
broke
from

grasp
and
stepped
between
him
and
dale
and
tweezy
closed
his
mouth
without
speaking
you
heard
what
she
said
racey
drawled
softly

and
tweezy
got
do

dale

a
corner
of
her
apron
between
her
hands

take
all
the
time
to
it
he
can
racey
evaded
the
direct
reply
but
whatever

think
of
taking
any
offer
like
that
of
tweezy
it
a
trick
thassall
no

and
when
i
say
that
everything
will
end
fine
and
daisy
you
better
believe
i

what
i
talking
about
molly
looked
at
him
keenly
racey
that
the
third
or
fourth
time
you
said
that
i
wonder
if
you
really
have
something
up
your
sleeve
of
course
i
have
racey
insisted
you
wait
you
see
what
do
you
know
tell
us
never
mind
and
i
wo
it
might
spoil
everything
if
i
told
you
you
just
leave
it
to
me
he
had
definitely
made
his
bluff
he
would
have
to
make
good
and
he
no
more
knew
how
to
make
good
in
the
business
than
the
baby
busy
with
its
toes
but
ere
this
men
have
killed
dragons
and
made
wonders
come
to
pass
all
for
the
sake
of
their
ladies
eyes
men
as
prosaic
and
as
the
puncher
racey
dawson
quite
so
after
the
departure
of
luke
tweezy
saltoun
and
tom
loudon
rode
in
on
lathered
horses
they
were
it
seemed
journeying
homeward
from
the
whither
they
had
gone
in
an
endeavour
to
persuade
lanpher
and
tweezy
to
sell
the
dale
mortgage
tweezy
huh
said
racey
he
just
left
here
he
must
rode
like
the
devil
said
saltoun
he
was
in
the
office
with
lanpher
when
we
left

racey
i
be
expecting
him
somewhere
beyond
the
cottonwood
grove
surrounding
moccasin
spring
a
galloping
horse
was
coming
in
a
moment
later
horse
and
rider
shot
past
the
tail
of
the
cottonwood
grove
and
bore
down
on
the
house
marie
exclaimed
racey
and
riding
one
of
my
hosses
observed
saltoun
at
that
instant
marie
caught
sight
of
the
three
men
and
swerved
her
mount
toward
them
they
said
at
the
bar
s
you
was
here
panted
the
lookout
pulling
up
in
front
of
racey
dawson
so
i
borrowed
a
fresh
hoss
and
kep
on
somethin
happened
in
farewell
racey
swing
tunstall
shot
downed
racey
did
not
usually
jump
at
conclusions
but
swing
tunstall
was
his
friend
marie
shook
her
tousled
head
nicked
shoulder
and
leg
but
it
their
fault
he
was
rubbed
out
who
responsible
demanded
racey
doc
coffin
you
said
honey
hoke
bumped
into
swing
just
as
he
went
after
his
gun
so
swing
could
get
his
gun
out
swing
said
honey
grabbed
his
wrist
but
peaches
austin
and
thompson
was
on
the
other
side
in
the
way
so
none
of
the
boys
seen
what
happened
to
swing
exactly
till
after
it
had
austin
thompson
hoke
and
coffin
said
racey
what
began
the
fuss
doc
coffin
upset
a
glass
of
whiskey
over
swing
arm
and
then
cussed
him
for
getting
his
arm
in
the
way
and
swing
called
him
a
liar
huh
and
a
one
too
elaborated
marie
job
gruffly
saltoun
gave
his
opinion
shore
tom
loudon
nodded
gravely
where
are
those
four
men
now
racey
asked
quietly
looking
at
marie
they
were
in
the
starlight
when
i
left
town
and
no
they
would
be
and
the
sheriff
and
kansas
went
to
dogville
this
morning
and
the
marshal
is
sick
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
my
gawd
i
thought
hear
the
news
from
somebody
else
before
i
got
here
and
go
bustin
in
regardless
and
i
guess
i
go
in
all
right
he
told
her
with
a
slight
smile
but
it
wo
be
regardless
with
that
he
turned
on
a
spurred
heel
and
crossed
springily
to
where
his
horse
stood
aw
the
devil
exclaimed
marie
looking
helplessly
at
tom
loudon
and
saltoun
and
he
do
it
too
then
she
kissed
to
her
horse
and
rode
into
the
cottonwood
grove
for
a
drink
at
the
spring
racey
sticking
foot
in
stirrup
found
molly
dale
at
his
elbow
she
was
looking
at
him
the
way
women
do
when
they
either
do
understand
or
think
they
understand
only
too
well
who
is
that
woman
asked
molly
dale
huh
thus
racey
stupidly
he
was
thinking
of
his
friend
lying
wounded
in
farewell
what
woman
you
mean
oh
her
that
marie
she
she
lookout
in
the
happy
heart
oh
yes
marie
i
i
seen
you
with
her
one
evening
when
you
and
she
were
crossing
the
street
and
i
drove
past
i
i
yes
indeed
and
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
her
figure
was
stiffer
than
the
proverbial
poker
which
was
odd
and
at
the
tail
of
her
words
she
gave
a
stiff
nod
and
hurried
into
the
house
which
was
odder
the
species
of
nod
and
the
hurry
both
but
racey
was
in
no
mood
to
speculate
on
the
idiosyncrasies
of
woman
even
woman
so
he
topped
his
mount
and
rejoined
tom
loudon
and
saltoun
they
regarded
him
silently
i
guess
said
racey
whirling
an
empty
by
i
borrow
some
of
yore
smokin
tom
i
plumb
afoot
for
tobacco
at
the
present
writing
tom
loudon
handed
over
his
pouch
without
a
word
but
saltoun
was
fidgety
unlike
his
he
felt
that
he
must
speak
lookit
here
racey
he
said
hurriedly
you
ai
going
to
farewell
alone
are
you
why
no
certainly
not
racey
replied
solemnly
i
going
to
send
word
to
yardly
for
the
troops
hell
bells
there
only
four
of
them
man
yes
well
who
this
one
of
our
boys
but
it
was
not
one
of
our
boys
it
was
rack
slimson
the
proprietor
of
the
starlight
saloon
but
he
was
riding
in
from
the
direction
of
the
bar
he
rode
soberly
as
one
bound
on
a
journey
of
length
even
as
marie
had
done
he
glimpsed
the
three
men
and
turned
his
horse
toward
them
ten
feet
from
the
flank
of
racey
dawson
mount
he
pulled
in
and
nodded
there
was
spite
spite
and
something
else
in
the
gaze
he
fixed
on
racey
dawson
yore
friend
hurt
said
he
got
in
a
fight
hurt
bad
asked
racey
not
bad
i
seen
worse
where
he
hurt
rack
slimson
merely
corroborated
what
marie
had
said
so
far
he
seemed
to
be
telling
the
truth
and
it
was
natural
that
there
should
be
spite
in
his
eyes
he
had
no
cause
to
feel
affection
for
either
man
but
there
was
the
something
else
besides
the
spite
in
those
eyes
that
was
what
interested
racey
you
come
here
special
to
tell
me
this
said
racey
staring
not
me
denied
rack
slimson
i
was
just
passing
by
and
i
thought
i
let
you
know
just
bein
neighbourly
huh
i
dunno
as
i
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
well
i
obliged
to
you
slimson
i
shore
a
heap
obliged
to
you
is
swing
tunstall
being
taken
care
of
all
right
he
in
mike
flynn
house
joy
blythe
is
him
then
i
ai
needed
in
farewell
right
now
racey
tone
was
casual
rack
slimson
rose
to
the
bait
immediately
he
asking
for
you
alla
time
said
he
he
is
is
he
why
did
you
say
so
at
first
i
did
know
it
was
necessary
which
is
true
more
ways
than
one
lookit
here
slimson
where
might
you
happen
to
be
going
when
you
run
into
me
so
providential
here
at
moccasin
spring
i
might
be
going
most
anywhere
rack
slimson
replied
with
a
flash
of
temper
no
call
to
get
het
rack
no
call
to
get
het
what
i
asking
is
a
fair
question
where
might
you
be
going
marysville
ai
you
off
the
trail
some
shore
i
am
some
i
remembered
something
i
got
ta
see
about
at
the
before
i
go
to
marysville
that
how
i
going
west
instead
of
south
when
did
you
first
remember
this
here
something
of
yores
when
i
stopped
at
the
bar
s
for
a
drink
of
water
and
after
you
just
happened
to
remember
this
something
i
you
just
happened
to
ask
where
i
was
and
they
told
you
moccasin
spring
is
that
the
how
of
it
yo
a
good
guesser
replied
rack
slimson
with
sarcasm
sometimes
i
do
make
a
centre
shot
racey
admitted
modestly
it
was
then
that
marie
wiping
her
mouth
with
the
back
of
her
hand
rode
forth
from
the
cottonwood
grove
at
sight
of
her
rack
eyes
opened
wide
then
they
narrowed
hell
he
muttered
turning
a
slightly
worried
look
on
racey
what
you
hellin
about
racey
inquired
pleasantly
you
knowed
about
swing
tunstall
alla
time
complained
rack
slimson
what
makes
you
think
so
racey
sidled
his
horse
closer
to
rack
she
told
you
thus
rack
bluntly
what
she
you
mean
aw
her
rack
slimson
jerked
his
head
toward
the
approaching
girl
he
got
again
said
racey
to
saltoun
and
tom
loudon
i
do
see
any
anywhere
do
you
not
me
chorussed
both
men
you
see
how
yo
mistaken
rack
pointed
out
racey
yore
eyes
are
deceivin
you
do
you
trust
you
do
see
any
girls
round
here
exceptin
maybe
miss
dale
over
at
the
house
you
might
seen
her
according
to
whether
she
came
to
the
kitchen
door
or
not
but
you
ai
seen
any
other
girl
here
and
you
better
be
shore
you
ai
why
had
i
blustered
rack
slimson
without
however
making
any
hostile
motion
with
his
hands
because
i
say
so
whatell
it
to
you
all
you
have
to
do
is
say
in
farewell
that
you
saw
marie
here
at
dale
and
you
find
out
i
even
go
farther
than
that
tellin
you
rack
that
if
anybody
finds
out
in
farewell
that
marie
was
here
or
if
any
accident
happens
to
her
any
accident
i
have
to
take
it
as
evidence
that
you
had
to
blat
fair
enough
huh
but
supposing
somebody
else
sees
her
and
tells
about
it
protested
rack
slimson
in
that
case
yo
out
of
luck
was
the
unfeeling
reply
but
began
again
rack
slimson
you
might
try
prayer
racey
interrupted
it
would
maybe
help
you
ca
tell
the
unhappy
rack
slimson
looked
toward
saltoun
and
tom
loudon
but
there
was
no
aid
for
him
in
that
quarter
in
fact
both
men
eyed
him
with
frank
hostility
so
you
see
marie
is
kept
out
of
it
racey
laid
his
final
injunction
on
rack
as
the
girl
in
question
joined
them
you
do
guess
this
girl
is
her
do
you
declared
rack
hastily
i
do
she
somebody
else
for
all
i
care
that
the
way
to
talk
racey
said
nodding
approvingly
you
keep
right
on
holding
to
those
sentiments
and
i
would
be
surprised
if
you
lived
quite
a
long
while
marie
showed
her
teeth
in
a
laugh
i
ai
of
any
such
breed
of
chunker
as
rack
slimson
said
she
calmly
i
can
manage
him
my
own
self
you
goin
back
to
farewell
racey
right
now
then
i
be
going
with
you
you
do
no
such
a
thing
there
no
sense
in
yore
running
into
trouble
thataway
you
come
in
to
farewell
after
me
and
from
another
direction
shore
i
was
going
to
i
was
only
gon
na
ride
along
with
you
part
way
racey
shook
his
head
would
be
sensible
that
would
somebody
might
see
you
you
come
along
later
like
i
told
you
me
and
rack
will
travel
together
i
was
goin
to
the
protested
rack
yo
mistaken
racey
told
him
firmly
yo
going
to
farewell
with
me
ai
you
i
so
rack
slimson
capitulated
then
get
marie
watched
the
two
men
ride
away
together
ai
he
the
hellion
she
said
admiringly
to
tom
and
old
salt
bound
to
have
his
own
way
if
it
kills
him
at
this
there
was
a
slight
sound
from
the
direction
of
the
garden
marie
and
the
two
men
turned
to
look
trowel
in
hand
molly
dale
was
kneeling
on
one
knee
between
the
brook
and
a
row
of
blue
camass
but
she
was
not
doing
any
weeding
she
was
staring
fixedly
at
marie
while
a
man
could
breathe
twice
molly
stared
at
marie
then
she
dropped
her
head
and
became
very
busy
with
the
trowel
marie
sniff
was
audible
at
thirty
feet
she
picked
up
her
reins
and
nodded
to
tom
loudon
and
saltoun
see
you
later
said
she
and
started
her
horse
in
the
direction
of
farewell
but
she
whirled
him
back
before
he
had
taken
three
steps
i
clean
forgot
he
was
yore
hoss
she
said
apologetically
to
saltoun
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
bar
s
first
thassall
right
saltoun
made
haste
to
assure
her
you
take
him
right
along
one
of
the
boys
can
ride
yore
hoss
to
town
on
the
next
trip
an
ride
this
one
back
that
save
me
a
lot
of
trouble
said
marie
turning
her
bewildered
mount
a
second
time
she
ai
ridin
straight
toward
farewell
said
tom
loudon
rolling
a
slow
cigarette
aw
she
sensible
yawned
saltoun
she
do
like
racey
says
all
right
she
must
like
him
a
lot
i
whatsa
matter
with
for
tom
loudon
had
contrived
to
make
a
long
leg
and
give
saltoun
a
vigorous
kick
on
the
ankle
i
guess
we
be
goin
dodged
tom
loudon
and
then
took
off
his
hat
to
miss
dale
so
long
miss
if
you
uh
you
know
where
the
bar
s
is
in
case
just
in
case
y
understand
he
touched
his
horse
with
the
spur
and
moved
off
with
as
much
dignity
as
a
colonel
of
cavalry
not
so
saltoun
he
had
been
kicked
and
the
kick
hurt
and
he
was
very
red
and
ruffled
in
consequence
swearing
under
his
breath
he
followed
his
here
he
demanded
crowding
his
horse
alongside
what
did
yuh
kick
me
for
tom
loudon
looked
over
his
shoulder
before
replying
the
was
a
hundred
yards
in
the
rear
and
molly
dale
was
not
in
sight
he
deliberately
turned
his
head
and
looked
his
straight
in
the
eye
what
did
i
kick
you
for
he
repeated
i
kicked
you
because
you
did
have
any
sense
this
was
too
much
huh
because
i
lookit
here
you
right
right
you
did
have
any
sense
here
molly
dale
thinks
racey
is
the
only
fellah
ever
rode
a
cayuse
and
you
have
to
blat
out
so
she
can
hear
you

shore
like

a
lot
well
what
of
it
i
do
see
you
do
wait
till
i
tell
kate
it
ai
necessary
to
tell
my
daughter
saltoun
remonstrated
hurriedly
i
suppose
my
saying
that
about
marie
might
give
molly
a
wrong
idea
maybe
about
racey
but
how
do
you
know
she
likes
racey
you
been
talking
to
her
did
she
tell
you
so
i
ai
and
she
did
i
been
talking
to
kate
she
told
me
ask
me
how
she
knows
she
says
she
knows
and
that
enough
for
me
you
ca
fool
a
woman
in
things
like
that
you
ca
fool
in
anything
saltoun
corroborated
bitterly
i
shore
ought
to
said
that
about
racey
and
marie
i
go
right
back
and
tell
molly
it
ai
so
saltoun
started
to
wheel
his
horse
but
tom
loudon
halted
that
manoeuvre
you
got
ta
let
it
go
now
said
he
if
you
tell
her
you
did
mean
what
you
said
she
shore
think
it
true
if
you
think
i
better
not
i
wo
saltoun
assented
doubtfully
but
i
would
say
anything
to
kate
if
i
was
you
then
i
wo
said
tom
loudon
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
where
you
think

queried
presently
this
ai
the
way
to
the
ranch
i
know
it
ai
it
the
way
to

whyfor

just
possible

xxv
strategy
racey
dawson
and
rack
slimson
rising
a
hill
on
the
way
to
farewell
simultaneously
turned
their
heads
and
looked
at
each
other
expression
was
dolefully
sullen
racey
was
hard
and
uncompromising
who
was
it

you
up
to
this
asked
racey

i
dunno
what
yo
talkin
about
the
ignorance
of
some
people
said
racey
recalling
sundry
occasions
when
other
folk
had
oddly
failed
to
grasp
his
meaning
they
rode
onward
silently
when
they
reached
the
southern
slope
of
indian
ridge
racey
headed
to
the
east
a
spirit
of
unease
lit
heavily
upon
the
sagging
shoulders
of
rack
slimson
you
ai
goin
straight
for
farewell
he
remarked
at
a
venture
i
ai

huh
rack
slimson
wrinkled
his
forehead
at
this
we
goin
in
town
from
the
side
explained
racey
dawson
this
too
was
a
puzzler
why
queried
rack
slimson
so
nobody
will
know
we
coming
till
we
there
the
smile
with
which
racey
garnished
his
answer
was
chilling
to
the
soul
of
slimson
but
i
do
see
you
would
i
tell
you
how
it
is
all
in
words
of
one
syllable
you
and
me
are
coming
into
town
from
the
east
where
that
draw
is
and
those
shacks
behind
the
dance
hall
we
leave
our
hosses
in
the
draw
and
proceed
like
they
say
in
the
army
on
foot
then
you

me
but
why

rack
slimson
desired
to
know

my

racey
assurance
that
he
would
do
the
right
thing
if
his
suspicions
proved
unfounded
did
not
appear
to
cheer
rack
slimson
i
lookit
here
he
began
desperately
ca
we
fix
this
here
up
some
way
i
dunno
as
shore

up
interposed
racey
heartily
go
after
yore
gun
any
time
you
feel
like
it
i
been
letting
you
keep
it
on
purpose
rack
slimson
did
not
accept
the
invitation
he
had
not
the
slightest
desire
to
go
after
his
gun
he
was
not
fast
enough
and
he
knew
it
it
ai
necessary
to
do
that
said
he
suit
yoreself
racey
told
him
calmly
hop
into
action
any
time
you
feel
like
it
of
course
before
we
get
to
that
draw
outside
farewell
where
we
gon
na
leave
our
hosses
i
have
to
take
yore
gun
away
later
i
might
be
too
busy
to
do
it
and
i
ca
afford
to
take
chance
not
with
four
or
five
men
you
can
see
that
yoreself
rack
slimson
saw
he
saw
other
things
too
oh
there
was
no
warmth
in
the
sunlight
and
the
sky
was
a
drabby
gray
and
he
was
filled
with
bitterness
unutterable
we
be
at
the
draw
some
time
soon
suggested
racey
ten
minutes
later
but
rack
slimson
hands
continued
to
remain
in
plain
sight
the
while
rack
gnawed
a
thin
and
bloodless
lip
when
at
long
last
the
draw
opened
before
them
racey
calmly
reached
over
and
removed
the
sixshooter
after
satisfying
himself
that
the
weapon
was
fully
loaded
he
stuffed
it
down
inside
the
waistband
of
his
trousers
then
he
buttoned
the
two
lower
buttons
of
his
vest
and
pulled
the
garment
in
question
over
the
protruding
butt
for
a
space
of
time
they
rode
the
bottom
of
the
draw
where
a
few
heavy
willows
grew
about
a
tiny
spring
racey
pulled
in
we
leave
the
cayuses
here
said
he
we
right
close
in
back
of
marie
shack
they
dismounted
tied
the
horses
to
separate
willows
and
climbed
the
side
of
the
draw
no
hurry
cautioned
racey
for
rack
slimson
was
showing
signs
of
a
nervous
haste
besides
i
want
to
pat
you
all
over
for
a
hideout
behind
the
blind
end
of
marie
shack
rack
slimson
submitted
to
being
searched
for
concealed
weapons
racey
found
none
not
even
a
let
go
said
racey
dawson
we
go
to
yore
saloon
first
and
you
pray
hard
that
nobody
sees
us
from
the
back
window
they
diagonalled
down
past
the
stage
company
corral
to
the
house
next
door
to
the
starlight
they
have
seen
us
yet
racey
observed
cheerfully
to
rack
slimson
whose
wretched
knees
had
been
knocking
together
ever
since
he
had
dismounted
slide
over
this
way
a
more
rack
now
take
off
yore
spurs
racey
stooped
and
removed
his
own
and
not
for
an
instant
did
he
lose
the
magic
of
the
drop
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
kept
rack
covered
from
the
moment
rack
set
his
to
earth
rack
spurs
jingled
on
the
ground
racey
let
them
lie
his
own
spurs
he
jammed
each
into
a
hip
pocket
i
have
to
be
careful
how
i
sit
down
now
he
remarked
jocularly
to
rack
slimson
you
ready
aw
right
you
know
the
way
to
the
starlight
back
door
the
back
door
of
the
saloon
was
wide
open
they
entered
on
tiptoe
the
proprietor
in
the
lead
remember
whispered
racey
when
he
discovered
the
back
room
to
be
empty
remember
i
right
behind
you
keep
on
yore
toes
he
held
rack
slimson
by
the
belt
and
pushed
him
toward
the
door
giving
into
the
front
room
this
door
was
shut
they
paused
behind
it
he
oughta
be
along
pretty
soon
complained
a
fretful
voice
that
racey
recognized
as
belonging
to
honey
hoke
we
do
mind
waiting
chimed
in
thompson
it
the
best
thing
we
do
this
was
big
doc
coffin
speaking
the
two
behind
the
door
heard
a
clink
against
the
rim
of
a
glass
you
better
not
take
too
much
advised
thompson
aw
who
takin
too
much
flung
back
honey
hoke
well
you
do
see
the
rest
of
us
touching
a
single
drop
do
you
speaking
personal
i
would
drown
insides
with
liquor
when
due
to
go
up
against
a
proposition
like
racey
dawson
here
was
praise
indeed
racey
thumbed
rack
slimson
in
the
ribs
rack
turned
his
head
and
saw
that
racey
was
grinning
rack
grew
even
more
spineless
you
see
pointed
out
racey
in
a
sardonic
whisper
yo
up
against
the
pure
quill
feller
which
remark
at
any
other
time
would
have
been
in
the
worst
possible
taste
but
license
is
extended
to
men
in
peril
of
their
lives
they
at
the
table
in
the
corner
beside
the
bar
this
end
they
resumed
racey
ai
it
lucky
the
door
opens
that
way
then
he
was
silent
for
a
time
while
he
strove
to
catch
the
accents
of
peaches
austin
he
wanted
to
know
if
they
were
all
four
at
the
one
table
but
peaches
was
either
not
talking
or
elsewhere
a
moment
later
the
question
was
answered
for
him
by
honey
hoke
if
he
slips
by
peaches
without
peaches
seem
him
began
honey
aw
hownell
can
he
sneered
doc
coffin
they
peaches
camped
down
in
front
of
the
blacksmith
shop
right
where
he
can
see
the
trail
alla
way
down
injun
ridge
a
dog
could
get
past
peaches
without
being
seen
let
alone
a
man
on
a
hoss
he
goes
round
the
ridge
offered
the
doubter
unconsciously
hitting
the
nail
on
the
head
he
wo
declared
the
confident
doc
he
come
boiling
right
in
like
he
owned
the
place
do
you
lose
no
sleep
over
maybe
rack
could
find
him
pursued
honey
hoke
and
an
answering
quiver
ran
through
the
frame
of
rack
slimson
rack
will
find
him
all
right
said
thompson
he
might
be
suspicious
of
rack
alla
same
honey
hoke
wavered
on
not
the
way
rack
will
tell
him
did
we
fix
it
up
just
what
rack
was
to
say
and
all
before
he
went
shore
we
did
he
wo
make
no
mistake
rack
wo
you
see
and
anyway
broke
in
doc
coffin
they
four
of
us
to
take
care
of
any
mistakes
at
which
the
three
laughed
loudly
i
hope
racey
whispered
in
rack
rather
grimy
left
ear
i
hope
you
heard
all
those
fellers
said
proves
i
was
right
do
it
nemmine
nodding
yore
head
more
once
hold
still
yo
doin
fine
yep
shore
glad
we
stood
here
like
we
have
makes
me
feel
a
heap
easier
in
my
mind
about
you
otherwise
i
might
always
have
had
a
doubt
i
did
right
i
have
been
shore
y
understand
but
i
have
been
shore
at
which
the
unfortunate
rack
came
within
an
eyewink
of
fainting
as
it
was
his
stomach
seemed
to
roll
over
and
over
he
began
to
feel
a
little
sick
the
bartender
now
went
on
racey
after
a
moment
is
he
likely
to
mix
into
this
i
dunno
breathed
rack
who
is
he
i
ai
been
in
yore
place
for
some
time
rack
told
him
the
name
of
the
bartender
and
racey
nodded
quite
as
if
rack
were
facing
him
and
could
see
everything
he
did
then
that
all
right
whispered
racey
i
know
that
feller
he
a
friend
of
mike
flynn
he
wo
do
anythin
hostyle
let
go
right
in
open
the
door
damn
yore
soul
or
i
blow
you
apart
rack
slimson
opened
the
door
and
immediately
endeavoured
to
spring
to
one
side
but
he
reckoned
not
on
the
strength
of
racey
dawson
the
latter
swung
rack
back
into
place
between
himself
racey
dawson
and
the
table
at
which
doc
coffin
and
his
two
friends
were
sitting
it
was
a
painfully
surprised
trio
that
confronted
racey
and
his
unwilling
barricade
the
bartender
was
likewise
surprised
he
immediately
fell
flat
on
the
floor
not
so
the
three
men
at
the
table
they
sat
quite
still
and
stared
at
the
man
and
the
gun
behind
the
body
of
their
friend
rack
slimson
they
said
nothing
perhaps
there
was
nothing
to
say
i
hear
you
were
expectin
me
doc
drawled
racey
his
eyes
bright
with
cold
anger
whatsa
matter
he
added
ai
three
of
you
enough
to
take
care
of
any
mistakes
at
which
doc
coffin
right
hand
flashed
downward
racey
drove
an
accurate
bullet
through
doc
coffin
mouth
the
bullet
ranging
upward
and
making
its
exit
through
the
parietal
bone
let
in
the
light
on
doc
hitherto
darkened
intellect
in
more
ways
than
one
doc
coffin
forefinger
tightening
convulsively
on
the
trigger
of
its
wearer
sixshooter
sent
an
unaimed
shot
downward
but
previous
to
embedding
itself
in
a
floor
board
the
bullet
passed
through
honey
hoke
foot
this
disturbed
honey
aim
to
such
an
extent
that
instead
of
shooting
racey
through
the
head
he
shot
rack
through
the
hat
racey
attending
strictly
to
his
knitting
bored
honey
hoke
with
a
bullet
that
removed
the
top
of
the
second
knuckle
of
honey
right
hand
shaved
a
piece
from
the
wrist
bone
and
then
proceeded
to
thoroughly
lacerate
most
of
the
muscles
of
the
forearm
before
finally
lodging
in
the
elbow
thus
was
honey
hoke
rendered
innocuous
for
the
time
being
he
was
not
a
gunfighter
as
yet
thompson
had
remained
strictly
neutral
his
hands
were
on
the
table
top
and
had
been
from
the
beginning
it
yore
move
thompson
racey
said
with
significance
then
i
be
goin
said
thompson
calmly
see
you
later
maybe
so
saying
he
rose
to
his
feet
turned
his
back
on
racey
and
walked
out
of
the
place
racey
had
no
illusions
as
to
thompson
but
he
obviously
could
not
shoot
him
in
the
back
he
let
him
go
watching
from
a
window
he
saw
thompson
go
to
the
in
front
of
the
saloon
untie
his
horse
mount
and
ride
away
northward
and
the
blacksmith
shop
in
front
of
which
peaches
austin
was
supposed
to
be
on
guard
lay
at
the
south
end
of
the
street
where
then
was
thompson
going
where
he
goin
he
demanded
of
the
now
wriggling
rack
slimson
huh
who
punch
i
dunno
where
jack
harpe
i
dunno
yo
a
liar
where
is
he
i
dunno
i
dunno
i
tell
you
yo
me
yo
lying
again
if
i
was
choking
you
you
could
talk
talkin
ai
you
where
jack
harpe
i
insisted
rack
slimson
his
teeth
chattering
as
racey
shook
him
is
he
in
town
i
is
thompson
going
after
him
do
you
think
i
i
guess
maybe
you
do
after
all
racey
said
disgustedly
flinging
the
unfortunate
from
him
with
such
force
that
the
fellow
skittered
quite
across
the
floor
and
sat
down
in
the
washpan
into
which
the
bartender
was
accustomed
to
throw
the
broken
glassware
it
was
a
hearty
howl
that
rack
slimson
uttered
as
he
bounded
erect
and
clutched
at
his
trousers
racey
eyes
brightened
at
the
sight
y
oughta
known
better
than
to
sit
down
in
all
that
glass
i
could
told
you
you
get
prickles
in
you
why
do
you
stand
still
and
let
yore
barkeep
pick
out
for
you
you
can
get
at
most
of
the
big
pieces
with
yore
fingers
he
added
to
the
bartender
who
was
gingerly
emerging
on
all
fours
round
the
end
of
the
bar
and
the
little
ones
you
can
dig
out
with
a
sharp
knife
yep
rack
i
bet
you
wo
carry
any
more
messages
on
horseback
for
a
while
there
was
a
sudden
crashing
thud
at
the
back
of
the
room
honey
hoke
had
fallen
out
of
his
chair
now
he
lay
on
the
floor
his
legs
drawn
up
and
the
back
of
his
frowsy
head
resting
against
a
rung
of
the
chair
in
which
still
sat
the
dead
body
of
doc
coffin
racey
went
to
honey
and
spread
him
out
in
a
more
comfortable
position
calloway
and
judge
dolan
entered
the
saloon
together
we
thought
we
heard
shootin
began
galloway
staring
in
astonishment
at
the
grotesque
posture
rack
slimson
had
assumed
the
better
to
endure
the
ministrations
of
the
bartender
we
heard
shootin
all
right
said
judge
dolan
his
glance
sweeping
past
slimson
and
the
bartender
to
the
rear
of
the
room
what
happened
racey
queried
dolan
striding
forward
both
of
cashed
racey
shook
his
head
doc
coffin
passed
out
said
he
in
a
hard
dry
voice
but
honey
hoke
heart
is
beatin
regular
enough
guess
only
fainted
from
loss
of
blood
the
judge
nodded
they
do
that
sometimes
here
he
looked
at
doc
coffin
body
lying
humped
over
the
table
an
arm
hanging
free
the
head
resting
on
the
were
they
rowin
together
was
the
judge
next
question
racey
gave
him
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
shooting
and
the
incidents
that
had
led
up
to
it
the
judge
heard
him
through
without
a
word
they
asked
for
it
said

to
withdraw
he
went
out
the
back
way
closing
the
door
he
set
his
shoulders
against
it
and
remained
motionless
a
moment
his
eyes
were
on
the
distant
hills
but
they
neither

slightest
warning
of

you
racey
continued
conversationally
i
did
want

that
why
i
kept
my
spurs
off
and
sifted
round
from
the
back
of
the
blacksmith
shop
and
you
were
expecting

to
come
scampering
down
the
trail
over
injun
ridge

peaches
sort
of
still
peaches

comfortable
peaches
you
mean
to
sit
there
and
tell
me
you

hear
any
shooting
up
at
the
starlight
a
while
back
peaches
austin
wetted
his
lips
with
the
tip
of
a
careful
tongue
i
heard
shootin
he
admitted
and
what
did
you
think
it
was
i
did
know
did
you
see
thompson
ride
away
shore
and
did
you
think
anything
about
that
either
oh
i
thought
but
but

yore
orders
to

here
and
wait
for
willie
and
you
always
obey
orders
that
it
peaches
what
are
you
drivin
at
yo
always
asking
me
that
peaches
try
something
new
for
a
change
look
racey
extended
a
long
arm
past
peaches
nose
and
pointed
up
the
street
toward
the
starlight
saloon
a
man
was
backing
out
through
the
doorway
another
followed
walking
forward
between
them
they
were
carrying
a
third
man
the
hat
of
the
third
man
was
over
his
face
his
arms
which
hung
down
jerked
like
the
arms
of
a
doll
even
at
that
distance
peaches
could
see
that
there
was
no
life
in
the
third
man
that
doc
coffin
racey
murmured
without
rancour
i
wonder
where
they
taking
him
he
used
to
bach
with
nebraska
jones
did
he
i
guess
that
where
they
taking
him
to
yep
they
gone
round
the
corner
of
the
stage
company
corral
where
honey
queried
peaches
in
a
still
small
voice
in
the
starlight
he
ai
hurt
bad
foot
and
arm
lucky
huh
peaches
austin
considered
these
things
a
moment
doc
coffin
was
reckoned
a
fast
man
he
said
in
the
tone
of
one
who
after
adding
up
a
column
of
figures
has
found
the
correct
total
and
honey
hoke
was
none
slow
himself
and
you
got
both
i
did
get
both
corrected
racey
honey
is
only
wounded
same
thing
you
could
got
if
you
wanted
to
yo
lucky
that
what
it
is
yo
lucky
and
you
been
lucky
from
the
beginning
i
ai
superstitious
but
here
he
lied
like
most
gamblers
peaches
was
sadly
superstitious
he
looked
at
racey
and
there
was
something
much
akin
to
wonder
on
his
countenance
he
shook
his
head
and
was
silent
a
long
thirty
seconds
yo
too
lucky
for
me
i
quit
he
finished
how
much
complete
i
tell
you
i
do
buck
no
such
luck
as
yores
no
longer
i
never
have
none
myself
if
i
do
i
goin
peaches
austin
got
to
his
feet
and
walked
across
the
street
to
the
hotel
twenty
minutes
later
racey
sitting
on
the
bench
in
front
of
the
blacksmith
shop
saw
him
issue
from
the
hotel
carrying
a
saddle
packed
saddlebags
and
blanket
and
bridle
and
go
to
the
hotel
corral
within
three
minutes
peaches
austin
rode
out
from
behind
the
hotel
as
he
passed
the
blacksmith
shop
he
said
so
long
to
racey
see
you
later
nodded
that
serene
young
man
i
hope
not
tossed
back
peaches
and
rode
on
down
the
trail
that
leads
over
indian
ridge
to
marysville
and
the
south
racey
watched
him
out
of
town
then
he
went
to
mike
flynn
to
see
and
if
it
were
possible
to
cheer
up
his
wounded
friend
swing
tunstall
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
see
him
swing
it
appeared
had
been
given
an
opiate
by
joy
blythe
who
was
acting
as
nurse
and
she
refused
to
awaken
her
patient
for
anybody
so
there
racey
went
to
the
happy
heart
to
while
away
the
remainder
of
the
hour
set
by
judge
dolan
the
bartender
greeted
him
respectfully
and
curiously
so
did
several
other
men
he
knew
for
that
respect
and
that
curiosity
he
understood
the
reason
it
lay
on
a
bunk
in
nebraska
jones
shack
no
one
asked
him
to
drink
people
are
usually
a
little
backward
in
social
intercourse
with
a
citizen
who
has
just
killed
his
fellowman
of
course
in
time
the
coolness
wears
off
in
this
case
the
time
would
be
short
doc
coffin
having
been
one
of
those
that
more
or
less
encumber
the
face
of
the
earth
but
for
the
moment
racey
felt
his
ostracism
and
resented
it
he
set
down
his
drink
half
drunk
and
walked
out
of
the
happy
heart
see
anything
of
luke
tweezy
lately
asked
judge
dolan
when
racey
was
sitting
across
the
table
from
him
in
the
judge
office
saw
him
where
moccasin
spring
judge
dolan
nodded
and
rasped
a
hand
across
his
stubbly
chin
luke
is
in
town
now
said
he
i
ai
lost
any
luke
tweezys
observed
racey
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
i
wonder
how
long
luke
is
figuring
on
staying
in
town
went
on
judge
dolan
sticking
like
a
stamp
to
his
original
subject
nothing
to
me
it
might
be
it
might
be
you
never
can
tell
about
them
things
racey
racey
dawson
eyes
came
down
from
the
ceiling
he
studied
the
face
attentively
what
was
dolan
driving
at
racey
had
known
the
judge
for
several
years
and
he
was
aware
that
the
more
indirect
the
judge
became
in
his
discourse
the
more
important
the
subject
matter
was
likely
to
be
no
said
racey
willing
to
bite
you
never
can
tell
we
was
talking
one
day
about
a
feller
making
mistakes
the
tangent
was
merely
apparent
yep
acquiesced
racey
we
were
saying
luke
tweezy
made
a
good
many
something
like
that
yeah
you
run
across
any
of
luke
mistakes
yet
racey
racey
shook
his
head
no
did
you
go
to
marysville
why
for
marysville
luke
tweezy
lives
in
marysville
and
you
think
there
somebody
in
marysville
would
talk
judge
dolan
looked
pained
i
did
say
so
he
was
quick
to
remark
i
know
you
did
but
i
do
guess
they
many
folks
in
marysville
much
about
luke
no
not
many
luke
is
careful
and
clever
damn
clever
but
they
other
things
besides
folks
which
might
have
useful
information
yeah
yeah
a
gent
a
lawyer
anyway
keeps
a
lot
of
papers
in
his
safe
as
a
rule
sometimes
them
papers
make
a
heap
interesting
readin
the
judge
paused
and
regarded
racey
coolly
they
might
prove
interesting
reading
that
a
fact
drawled
racey
now
i
ai
suggestin
anything
pursued
judge
dolan
i
could
on
account
of
my
oath
but
it
ai
so
far
from
farewell
to
marysville
it
ai
far
i
got
a
notion
luke
tweezy
will
find
important
business
to
keep
him
here
in
farewell
the
next
four
or
five
days
i
wonder
what
kind
of
a
safe
luke
has
got
murmured
racey
damfino
said
the
judge
you
know
anything
about
dynamite
how
handled
huh
shore
handle
it
carefully
i
mean
how
to
prepare
a
fuse
and
detonator
and
stick
it
in
the
cartridge
you
know
how
i
helped
a
miner
man
once
for
a
week
shore
i
know
you
cut
the
fuse
stick
the
square
end
into
the
cap
until
it
touches
the
fulminate
and
crimp
down
the
copper
shell
all
round
with
a
dull
knife
to
hold
the
fuse
then
you
make
a
hole
in
the
end
of
the
cartridge
and
i
guess
you
know
yore
business
racey
interrupted
judge
dolan
you
find
a
package
on
that
shelf
by
the
door
handle
it
carefully
i
glad
you
dropped
in
racey
nice
weather
we
having
but
there
are
some
people
about
due
for
a
cold
wave
capped
racey
stopping
on
his
way
out
to
take
the
package
from
the
shelf
and
wink
at
judge
dolan
the
wink
was
not
returned
but
the
judge
tongue
may
have
been
in
his
cheek
he
was
a
most
human
person
was
judge
dolan
of
farewell
racey
handling
the
package
with
care
went
back
to
the
draw
where
he
had
left
the
two
horses
in
the
draw
he
opened
the
package
it
contained
six
sticks
of
dynamite
and
the
necessary
detonators
and
fuse
good
old
judge
said
racey
admiringly
and
rewrapped
the
dynamite
the
detonators
and
the
fuse
with
even
more
care
than
he
had
employed
in
unwrapping
them
he
rolled
the
package
into
his
slicker
and
tied
down
the
slicker
behind
the
cantle
of
his
saddle
untying
the
two
horses
he
mounted
his
own
and
leading
the
other
rode
to
the
hotel
corral
bill
lainey
was
only
too
glad
to
lend
him
a
fresh
horse
and
a
bran
sack
it
was
dusk
when
he
dismounted
at
the
dale
corral
there
was
a
lamp
in
the
kitchen
its
rays
shone
out
through
the
open
door
and
made
a
rectangle
of
golden
light
on
the
dusty
earth
molly
was
standing
at
the
kitchen
table
she
was
stirring
something
in
a
bowl
she
did
not
turn
her
head
when
he
came
to
the
door
evenin
molly
said
racey
good
evening
just
that
uh
yore
ma
around
she
gone
to
bed
still
the
dark
head
was
not
raised
he
misunderstood
both
her
brevity
and
the
following
silence
he
left
his
hat
on
the
washbench
outside
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
kitchen
do
take
it
so
to
heart
molly
he
said
awkwardly
it
hard
but
shucks
lookit
i
got
something
to
tell
you
in
very
truth
he
had
something
to
tell
her
but
he
had
not
meant
to
tell
her
so
soon
lem
me
take
care
of
you
molly
dear
you
know
i
love
you
and
stop
molly
turned
to
him
an
expressionless
face
she
looked
at
him
steadily
you
say
you
love
me
she
went
on
shore
i
say
it
he
was
plainly
puzzled
at
her
reception
of
what
he
had
said
girls
did
not
act
this
way
in
books
how
about
that
that
other
girl
marie
i
think
her
name
is
what
about
her
a
good
deal
what
has
she
got
to
do
with
my
loving
you
i
like
to
know
she
loves
you
marie
loves
me
yo
crazy
oh

i
if
she
had
loved
you
do
you
think
for
one
minute
come
riding
all
the
way
out
here
to
give
you
a
warning
marie
and
i
are
friends
he
admitted
but
there
ai
any
law
against
that
none
at
all
molly
eyes
dropped
her
head
turned
back
she
resumed
her
operations
with
a
spoon
in
the
bowl
lookit
here
molly
do
you
call
me
molly
her
tone
was
as
lacking
in
expression
as
was
her
face
but
you
got
to
listen
to
me
he
insisted
desperately
i
tell
you
there
ai
anything
between
marie
and
me
then
there
ought
to
be
thus
molly
womanlike
she
yearned
to
use
her
claws
but
oh
i
heard
all
about
your
carryings
on
with
that
creature
how
you
talk
to
her
and
people
have
seen
you
walking
with
her
on
the
street
i
saw
you
myself
yesterday
when
mis
jackson
drove
out
here
to
buy
three
hens
she
told
me
when
the
girl
was
arrested
and
fined
for
trying
to
murder
a
man
you
stepped
up
and
paid
her
fine
did
you
i
did
but
there
are
any
buts
you
got
a
nerve
you
have
making
love
to
me
after
running
round
with
that
wretched
hussy
she
ai
a
hussy
denied
the
exasperated
racey
who
was
always
loyal
to
absent
friends
she
all
right
just
because
she
happens
to
be
a
lookout
in
the
happy
heart
ai
anything
against
her
it
give
you
nor
anybody
else
license
to
insult
her
this
was
too
much
not
content
with
confessing
his
friendship
for
the
girl
he
was
standing
up
for
her
molly
whirled
upon
him
go
tone
and
business
could
not
have
been
excelled
by
peg
woffington
herself
racey
went
what
the
matter
queried
a
sleepy
voice
from
the
doorway
giving
into
an
inner
room
as
racey
spurred
heels
jingled
past
the
washbench
what
goin
on
who
was
here
what
you
yelling
about
anyway
racey
was
here
ma
said
molly
seems
to
me
you
made
an
uncommon
racket
about
it
grumbled
her
mother
plodding
into
the
kitchen
in
her
slippers
her
gray
hair
was
all
in
strings
about
her
face
her
eyes
and
cheeks
were
puffed
with
sleep
she
had
pulled
a
quilt
round
her
shoulders
over
her
nightdress
now
she
gave
the
quilt
a
hitch
up
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
make
me
a
cup
o
coffee
will
you
molly
said
dale
my
head
aches
sort
of
i
hope
you
did
have
a
fight
with
racey
dawson
well
we
did
quite
agree
admitted
molly
snapping
shut
the
cover
of
the
and
clamping
the
mill
between
her
knees
i
like
him
any
more
ma
and
after
he
helped
us
so
i
was
counting
on
him
to
fix
up
this
mortgage
business
whatever
got
into
you
molly
he
been
running
round
with
that
awful
lookout
girl
at
the
happy
heart
is
that
all
yawned
dale
greatly
relieved
i
thought
it
might
have
been
something
serious
it
is
serious
what
right
has
he
to
why
has
he
you
ai
engaged
to
him
i
know
i
not
but
he
i
you
molly
began
to
flounder
has
he
ever
told
you
he
loved
you
dale
inquired
shrewdly
not
in
so
many
words
but
but
you
know
he
does
well
so
do
i
know
he
does
i
knew
it
soon
as
you
did
before
most
likely
do
you
fret
molly
he
come
back
no
he
wo
not
now
i
do
want
him
to
then
who
to
fix
up
this
mortgage
business
with
tweezy
i
like
to
know
i
declare
i
wish
i
taken
that
lawyer
offer
we
have
something
then
anyhow
now
we
have
to
get
out
without
a
nickel
oh
molly
what
did
you
quarrel
with
racey
for
chapter
xxvii
burglary
merely
because
he
believed
that
the
all
was
over
between
molly
dale
and
himself
racey
did
not
relinquish
his
plans
for
the
future
he
rode
to
marysville
as
he
had
intended
that
is
he
rode
to
the
vicinity
of
marysville
for
arriving
at
a
hill
five
miles
outside
of
town
in
the
broad
of
an
afternoon
he
stopped
in
a
hollow
under
the
cedars
and
waited
for
night
daylight
was
decidedly
not
appropriate
for
the
act
he
contemplated
i
wonder
he
muttered
as
he
lay
with
his
back
braced
against
a
tree
and
stared
at
the
bulge
in
his
slicker
i
wonder
if
i
ought
to
use
all
them
sticks
at
once
i
never
heard
that
miner
man
say
how
much
of
an
argument
a
safe
needed
i
i
better
use
all
luke
tweezy
was
a
bachelor
his
office
was
in
his
house
and
he
did
not
employ
a
housekeeper
further
than
this
racey
dawson
knew
nothing
of
the
lawyer
establishment
but
he
believed
that
his
knowledge
was
sufficient
to
serve
his
purpose
about
midnight
racey
dawson
removed
himself
his
horse
and
his
dynamite
from
the
hollow
on
the
hill
to
where
a
lone
pine
grew
almost
directly
in
the
rear
of
and
two
hundred
yards
from
the
residence
of
luke
tweezy
he
had
selected
the
tall
and
lonely
pine
as
the
best
place
to
leave
his
horse
because
should
he
be
forced
to
run
for
it
he
would
have
against
the
stars
a
plain
landmark
to
run
for
he
thoroughly
expected
to
be
forced
to
run
six
sticks
of
dynamite
letting
go
together
would
arouse
a
cemetery
and
marysville
was
a
lively
village
racey
taking
no
chances
on
the
lainey
horse
stampeding
at
the
explosion
the
animal
to
the
trunk
of
the
pine
after
which
he
removed
his
spurs
carefully
unwrapped
the
dynamite
and
stuck
three
sticks
in
each
the
caps
in
their
little
box
he
put
in
the
of
his
shirt
with
the
coil
of
fuse
in
one
hand
and
the
bran
sack
given
him
by
lainey
in
the
other
he
walked
toward
the
house
of
tweezy
the
house
was
of
course
dark
nor
were
there
any
lights
in
the
irregular
line
of
houses
stretching
up
and
down
this
side
of
the
street
the
neighbours
had
apparently
all
gone
to
bed
through
an
opening
between
two
houses
racey
saw
a
brightly
lighted
window
in
a
house
an
eighth
of
a
mile
away
that
would
be
judge
allison
house
the
judge
then
was
awake
two
hundred
and
twenty
yards
was
not
a
long
distance
even
for
a
portly
man
like
judge
allison
to
cover
at
speed
and
racey
had
known
judge
allison
to
move
briskly
on
occasion
racey
moving
steadily
ahead
slid
past
someone
barn
and
opened
up
a
view
of
the
dance
hall
it
had
previously
been
concealed
from
his
sight
by
the
high
posts
and
rails
of
three
corrals
the
dance
hall
was
going
full
blast
at
least
all
the
windows
were
bright
with
light
he
was
too
far
away
to
hear
the
fiddles
the
dance
hall
he
might
have
known
it
would
still
be
operating
at
midnight
but
it
was
almost
twice
as
far
from
the
tweezy
house
to
the
dance
hall
as
it
was
from
the
judge
house
to
tweezy
that
was
something
indeed
it
was
a
great
deal
but
he
would
have
to
work
fast
all
the
neighbours
would
come
bouncing
out
at
the
crash
of
the
explosion
racey
paused
to
flatten
an
ear
at
the
kitchen
door
he
heard
nothing
and
tiptoed
along
the
wall
to
the
window
of
the
room
next
the
kitchen
the
ground
plan
of
the
house
was
almost
an
exact
square
there
was
a
room
in
each
angle
the
office
which
racey
knew
contained
the
safe
was
diagonally
across
from
the
kitchen
racey
halting
at
the
window
of
the
room
next
the
kitchen
was
somewhat
surprised
to
find
it
open
he
stuck
in
his
head
and
saw
a
faint
glow
beyond
the
door
of
the
office
the
glow
seemed
to
be
brighter
near
the
floor
racey
listened
intently
he
heard
a
faint
grumble
and
now
and
then
a
squeak
he
crouched
beneath
the
window
and
removed
his
boots
then
he
crawled
over
the
sill
and
hunkered
down
on
the
uncarpeted
floor
the
floor
boards
did
not
creak
still
crouching
his
arms
extended
in
front
of
him
he
made
his
way
silently
across
the
room
skirting
safely
in
the
process
two
chairs
and
a
table
and
stood
upright
behind
the
crack
of
the
door
looking
through
the
crack
he
perceived
that
the
glow
he
had
seen
from
the
window
emanated
from
a
tin
can
pierced
with
several
holes
the
dim
uncertain
light
revealed
the
figure
of
a
tall
and
hatless
man
kneeling
beside
the
safe
the
man
back
was
toward
the
lighted
tin
can
one
of
the
tall
man
hands
was
slowly
turning
the
knob
of
the
combination
the
side
of
the
man
head
was
pressed
against
the
front
of
the
safe
near
the
combination
racey
could
not
see
the
man
face
across
the
window
of
the
room
two
blankets
had
been
hung
the
door
into
the
other
front
room
was
open
then
suddenly
the
doorway
was
no
longer
a
black
void
a
man
stood
there
a
fat
man
with
a
stomach
that
hung
out
over
the
waistband
of
his
trousers
there
was
something
very
familiar
about
the
figure
of
that
fat
man
the
fat
man
leaned
against
the
doorjamb
and
pushed
back
his
wide
black
hat
the
light
in
the
tin
can
illumined
his
countenance
dimly
but
racey
eyes
were
becoming
accustomed
to
the
half
darkness
he
was
able
to
recognize
jacob
pooley
fat
jakey
pooley
the
register
of
the
district
whose
home
was
in
piegan
city
you
ai
as
fast
as
you
used
to
be
observed
fat
jakey
in
a
soft
whisper
shut
up
hissed
the
kneeling
man
and
turned
his
face
for
an
instant
toward
fat
jakey
so
that
the
light
shone
upon
his
features
it
was
jack
harpe
what
biting
your
ear
fat
jakey
asked
i
told
you
more
once
to
let
what
past
alone
grumbled
jack
harpe
hell
there
nobody
around
nemmine
whether
they
is
or
not
you
get
out
of
the
habit
rats
sneered
fat
jakey
what
was
that
jack
harpe
figure
tautened
in
a
flash
rats
repeated
fat
jakey
i
thought
i
heard
something
persisted
jack
harpe
you
heard
rats
chuckled
fat
jakey
you
nervous
that
the
matter
or
else
you
ai
able
to
open
the
safe
i
can
open
the
safe
all
right
growled
jack
harpe
bending
again
to
his
work
i
wonder
what
he
did
hear
racey
said
to
himself
i
thought
i
heard
something
too
whatever
it
was
he
did
not
hear
it
again
there
she
is
said
jack
harpe
suddenly
and
threw
open
the
safe
door
it
was
at
this
precise
juncture
that
a
voice
from
the
darkness
behind
fat
jakey
said
hands
up
oh
it
was
then
that
events
began
to
move
with
celerity
fat
jakey
pooley
ducked
and
leaped
jack
harpe
kicked
the
tin
can
the
candle
fell
out
and
rolled
guttering
in
a
quarter
circle
only
to
be
extinguished
by
one
of
fat
jakey
flying
feet
there
was
a
slithering
sound
as
the
blankets
across
the
window
were
ripped
down
followed
by
a
scraping
and
a
heaving
and
a
grunting
as
two
large
people
endeavoured
to
make
their
egress
through
the
same
window
at
the
same
time
so
that
window
was
open
alla
time
thought
racey
as
he
prudently
waited
for
the
owner
of
the
voice
in
the
other
room
to
discover
himself
but
this
the
voice
owner
did
not
immediately
do
racey
could
not
understand
why
he
did
not
shoot
while
the
two
men
were
struggling
through
the
window
lord
knows
he
had
plenty
of
time
and
opportunity
even
after
jack
harpe
and
fat
jakey
had
reached
the
outer
air
and
presumably
gone
elsewhere
swiftly
there
was
no
sound
from
the
other
room
racey
his
gun
ready
waited
at
first
his
impulse
had
been
incontinently
to
flee
the
premises
as
jack
and
jake
had
done
but
a
saving
second
thought
held
him
where
he
was
it
was
more
than
possible
that
the
mysterious
fourth
man
had
designs
on
the
contents
of
the
safe
in
which
event
racey
stood
pat
he
heard
no
sound
for
at
least
a
minute
after
jack
and
jake
had
left
then
he
heard
a
soft
swish
and
a
few
stars
which
had
been
visible
through
the
upper
half
of
the
window
were
blotted
out
the
blankets
were
being
readjusted
a
match
was
struck
and
a
figure
stooped
for
the
candle
that
had
been
dashed
out
by
the
foot
of
fat
jakey
pooley
a
table
shielded
the
figure
from
racey
then
the
figure
straightened
and
set
the
flaring
match
to
the
candle
end
and
the
face
that
bent
above
the
light
was
the
face
of
one
he
knew
molly
he
whispered
and
slipped
from
his
ambush
at
which
molly
dropped
candle
and
match
and
squeaked
in
affright
but
her
scare
did
not
prevent
her
from
drawing
a
sixshooter
he
heard
the
click
of
the
hammer
and
whispered
desperately
molly
molly
me
racey
he
struck
a
match
and
retrieved
the
candle
and
lit
it
quickly
by
its
light
he
saw
her
staring
at
him
uncertainly
her
eyes
were
bright
with
conflicting
emotions
her
sixshooter
still
pointed
in
his
general
direction
put
yore
gun
away
he
advised
her
we
got
no
time
to
lose
hold
the
candle
for
me
put
it
in
the
can
first
automatically
she
obeyed
the
several
commands
he
knelt
before
the
open
safe
and
beginning
at
the
top
shelf
he
stuffed
into
his
bran
sack
every
piece
of
paper
the
safe
contained
besides
papers
there
were
two
sixshooters
and
a
bowie
these
he
did
not
take
when
the
safe
was
clean
of
papers
racey
tied
the
mouth
of
the
bran
sack
took
molly
by
the
hand
and
blew
out
the
candle
he
said
shortly
we
be
leavin
here
now
towing
her
behind
him
he
led
her
to
the
window
of
the
rear
room
holding
his
hat
by
the
brim
he
shoved
it
out
through
the
window
no
blow
or
shot
followed
the
action
he
clapped
the
hat
on
his
head
and
looked
out
cautiously
he
satisfied
himself
that
the
coast
was
clear
and
flung
a
leg
over
the
sill
when
he
had
helped
out
molly
he
gave
her
the
sack
to
hold
and
pulled
on
his
boots
where
yore
hoss
he
whispered
i
tied
him
at
the
corner
of
the
nearest
corral
was
the
answer
said
he
and
took
her
again
by
the
hand
they
had
not
gone
ten
steps
when
she
stumbled
and
fell
against
him
whatsa
matter
nothing
was
the
almost
breathless
reply
i
i
all
right
i
just
stepped
on
a
sharp
stone
yore
shoes
he
murmured
contritely
i
never
thought
why
you
say
something
here
so
saying
he
scooped
her
up
in
his
arms
settled
her
in
place
with
due
regard
for
the
box
of
caps
in
his
and
plowed
on
through
the
night
her
arms
went
round
his
neck
and
her
head
went
down
on
his
shoulder
she
sighed
a
gentle
little
sigh
for
a
sigh
like
that
racey
would
cheerfully
have
shot
a
sheriff
posse
to
pieces
i
left
my
shoes
in
my
saddle
pocket
she
said
apologetically
i
i
thought
it
would
be
safer
there
was
a
sudden
yell
somewhere
on
main
street
it
sounded
as
if
it
came
from
uncomfortably
close
to
the
tweezy
house
then
a
sixshooter
cracked
once
twice
and
again
at
the
third
shot
racey
was
running
as
tight
as
he
could
set
foot
to
the
ground
encumbered
as
he
was
with
a
double
armful
of
girl
and
a
fairly
heavy
sackful
of
papers
he
yet
made
good
time
to
the
corner
of
the
nearest
corral
the
increasing
riot
in
main
street
undoubtedly
was
a
most
potent
spur
which
way
the
hoss
he
gasped
when
the
dark
rail
of
the
corral
fretted
the
sky
before
them
you
heading
straight
she
replied
calmly
thirty
feet
more
and
you
run
into
him
better
set
me
down
he
did
literally
he
turned
his
foot
on
a
tin
can
and
went
down
forced
to
guard
his
box
of
caps
with
one
hand
he
could
not
save
molly
dale
a
smashing
fall
guggled
molly
squirming
on
the
ground
for
she
had
struck
the
pit
of
her
stomach
on
a
round
rock
the
size
of
a
football
and
the
wind
was
knocked
out
of
her
racey
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
knowing
that
if
molly
was
able
to
wriggle
and
groan
she
could
not
be
badly
hurt
picked
up
the
sack
and
scouted
up
molly
horse
he
found
it
without
difficulty
and
tied
the
sack
with
the
saddle
strings
in
front
of
the
horn
he
loosed
the
horse
and
led
it
to
where
molly
still
lay
on
the
ground
the
poor
girl
was
sitting
up
clutching
her
stomach
and
rocking
back
and
forth
and
fighting
for
her
breath
with
gasps
and
crows
but
there
was
not
time
to
wait
till
she
should
regain
the
full
use
of
her
lungs
not
in
the
face
of
the
shouts
and
yells
in
main
street
lord
the
whole
town
was
up
lights
were
flashing
in
every
house
racey
stooped
seized
molly
under
the
armpits
and
heaved
her
bodily
into
the
saddle
hang
onto
the
horn
he
ordered
and
for
gosh
sake
do
make
so
much
noise
molly
obeyed
as
best
she
could
he
mounted
behind
her
and
of
course
had
to
fight
the
horse
which
harboured
no
intention
of
carrying
double
if
it
could
help
itself
racey
however
was
a
rider
and
he
jerked
molly
quirt
from
where
it
hung
on
the
horn
not
more
than
sixty
seconds
were
wasted
before
they
were
travelling
toward
the
lone
pine
as
tight
as
the
horse
could
jump
at
the
pine
racey
slipped
to
the
ground
and
ran
to
untie
his
horse
can
you
hang
on
all
right
at
a
trot
if
i
lead
yore
hoss
he
queried
sharply
his
fingers
busy
with
the
knot
of
the
rope
i
and
him
too
she
stuttered
picking
up
her
reins
and
making
a
successful
effort
to
sit
up
straight
at
he
looked
there
were
certainly
three
lanterns
bobbing
about
in
the
open
behind
the
house
of
luke
tweezy
he
knew
too
well
what
those
lights
meant
the
marysville
citizens
were
hunting
for
a
hot
trail
he
swung
up
with
a
rush
stick
right
alongside
me
he
told
her
we
trot
at
first
till
we
get
behind
the
hill
out
yonder
after
that
we
can
hit
the
landscape
lively
she
spoke
no
word
till
they
had
rounded
the
little
hill
and
were
galloping
south
then
she
said
in
her
normal
voice
this
is
the
way
home
i
know
it
ai
we
got
to
lose
whoever
follows
us
before
we
skip
for
home
of
course
she
told
him
humbly
i
might
have
known
you
always
think
of
the
right
thing
racey
all
of
which
was
balm
to
a
hitherto
tortured
soul
that
all
right
he
said
modestly
and
how
strong
you
are
carrying
me
and
that
heavy
sack
all
that
distance
both
admiration
and
appreciation
were
in
her
tone
any
man
would
have
been
made
happy
thereby
racey
was
overjoyed
and
the
daughter
of
eve
at
his
side
knew
that
he
was
overjoyed
and
was
made
glad
herself
she
did
not
realize
that
eve
invariably
employed
the
same
method
with
our
grandfather
adam
he
reached
across
and
patted
her
arm
yo
all
right
he
told
her
when
we
get
out
of
this
yo
going
to
marry
me
her
free
hand
turned
under
his
and
clasped
his
fingers
they
rode
for
a
space
and
racey
heart
was
full
and
so
was
hers
if
they
forgot
for
the
moment
what
dread
possibilities
the
future
held
who
can
blame
them
chapter
xxviii
the
letters
but
what
was
yore
idea
in
coming
to
marysville
to
get
that
release
father
signed
i
thought
it
might
be
in
his
safe
anybody
give
you
the
idea
it
might
be
she
shook
her
head
nobody
you
got
more
brains
than
i
have
for
a
fact
but
how
were
you
figuring
on
getting
into
the
safe
oh
i
brought
a
bunch
of
keys
along
what
are
you
laughing
at
i
thought
one
might
fit
keys
for
a
safe
say
do
you
know

keys

got
combinations
safes

i
did
know
it
how
could
i
i
never
saw
a
safe
in
my
life
till
i
saw
this
one
i
thought
they
had
locks
like
any
other
ordinary
oh
i
think
you
horrid
to
laugh
i
not
laughing

over
and
i

i
was
such
a
fool
as
you
seem
to
think

brought
an
extra
key
along
in
case

others

key
surely
seven
sticks
of
dynamite
caps
and
fuse
chuck
had
a
lot
he
was
using
for
blowing
stumps
so
i
borrowed
some
from
his
barn
he
did
know
i
took
it
i
should
hope
not
racey
declared
fervently
you
leave
dynamite
alone
do
you
hear
where
is
it
now
oh
i
left
it
on
the
floor
in
tweezy
house
when
i
found
i
need
it
any
longer
thank
god
breathed
racey
whose
hair
had
begun
to
rise
at
the
bare
idea
of
the
explosives
still
being
somewhere
on
her
person
what
was
yore
motive
in
hold
in
up
jack
harpe
and
jakey
pooley
was
that
who
they
were
i
could
see
their
faces
well
when
i
had
broken
the
lock
and
opened
the
back
window
and
crawled
through
i
went
into
the
front
room
where
i
thought
likely
the
safe
would
be
and
i
was
just
going
to
strike
a
match
when
i
heard
a
snap
at
the
front
window
as
the
lock
broke
maybe
i
was
good
and
scared
i
paddled
into
the
other
front
room
by
mistake
got
turned
around
in
the
dark
i
suppose
and
before
i
could
open
a
window
and
get
out
i
heard
two
men
in
the
front
room
i
just
left
i
did
dare
open
a
window
then
they
have
heard
me
surely
so
i
just
knelt
down
behind
a
bed
and
after
a
while
when
one
man
was
busy
at
the
safe
the
fat
man
came
into
my
room
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
inside
the
door
lordy
i
hardly
dared
breathe
it
a
wonder
my
hair
did
turn
white
once
i
thought
they
must
have
heard
me
the
time
the
fat
man
said
honestly
i
was
so
scared
i
was
almost
sick
but
you
have
nerve
enough
to
try
and
hold
them
up
i
had
to
when
i
found
out
they
were
going
to
rob
the
safe
i
had
to
do
something
why
they
might
have
taken
the
very
paper
i
wanted
and
somehow
later
tweezy
might
have
gotten
it
back
i
could
allow
that
i
knew
that
i
must
get
at
what
was
inside
the
safe
before
they
did
i
just
had
to
so
when
the
fat
man
got
up
from
his
chair
and
stood
in
the
doorway
with
his
back
to
me
i
just
gritted
my
teeth
and
stood
up
and
said
up
my
gawd
girl
you
might
been
shot
i
had
a
sixshooter
she
said
tranquilly
but
i
would
have
shot
first
she
added
reflectively
then
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
tightly
but
i
do
see
why
he
said
after
an
interval
you
had
to
go
off
on
a
chase
thisaway
did
i
tell
you
i
was
going
to
fix
it
up
for
you
could
you
trusted
me
enough
to
lem
me
do
it
my
own
way
we
had
that
that
quarrel
in
the
kitchen
and
i
thought
you
like
me
any
more
and
and
would
have
any
more
to
do
with
me
and
that
it
was
my
job
to
do
something
to
help
out
the
family
please
racey
i
ca
breathe
another
interval
and
she
resolutely
pushed
his
arms
down
and
held
him
away
from
her
with
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
tell
me
said
she
her
blue
eyes
plumbing
the
very
depths
of
his
soul
tell
me
you
do
love
anybody
else
he
told
her
later
there
was
a
time
once
when
i
thought
you
liked
luke
tweezy
he
observed
lazily
how
horrible
she
murmured
with
a
slight
shudder
as
she
snuggled
closer
and
that
was
that
i
think
dearest
said
molly
raising
her
head
from
his
shoulder
some
twenty
minutes
later
that
it
light
enough
now
to
see
in
the
sack
so
in
the
brightness
of
a
splendid
dawn
snugly
hidden
on
the
flank
of
one
of
the
frying
pan
mountains
they
opened
the
bran
sack
and
went
through
every
paper
it
contained
there
were
deeds
mortgages
legal
documents
of
every
description
they
found
the
dale
mortgage
but
they
did
not
find
the
release
alleged
to
have
been
signed
by
dale
immediately
prior
to
his
death
of
course
that
mortgage
is
recorded
said
racey
dolefully
staring
at
the
pile
of
papers
so
destroyin
that
wo
help
us
any
the
release
he
carrying
with
him
and
i
do
see
anything
here
one
we
missed
said
molly
dale
in
a
hopeless
tone
picking
up
a
slip
of
paper
from
where
it
had
fallen
behind
a
saddle
the
slip
of
paper
was
folded
several
times
she
opened
it
and
spread
it
out
against
her
knee
why
how
queer
she
muttered
huh
in
an
instant
racey
was
looking
over
her
shoulder
when
both
had
thoroughly
digested
the
meaning
of
the
writing
on
that
piece
of
paper
they
sat
back
and
regarded
each
other
with
wide
eyes
this
ought
to
fix
things
breathed
molly
fix
things
cried
racey
cinch
we
got
him
like
that
he
snapped
his
fingers
joyfully
molly
reached
for
the
bran
sack
you
only
shook
it
out
she
said
i
going
to
turn
it
inside
out
maybe
we
find
something
else
they
did
find
something
else
they
found
a
document
caught
in
the
end
seam
they
read
it
with
care
and
great
interest
well
said
racey
when
he
came
to
the
signatures
no
wonder
jack
harpe
and
jakey
pooley
wanted
to
get
into
the
safe
no
wonder
if
we
do
get
the
whole
gang
now
we
no
good
and
to
think
we
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
i
was
took
in
i
never
thought
anything
else
and
it
does
lie
just
right
for
a
cow
ranch
of
course
it
does
you
could
help
being
fooled
none
of
us
had
any
idea
i
oughta
worked
it
out
he
grumbled
there
ai
any
excuse
for
my
swallowing
what
jack
harpe
told
me
lordy
i
was
easy
what
do
you
care
now
everything
all
right
and
you
got
me
have
you
and
here
she
leaned
across
the
bran
sack
to
kiss
him
she
could
not
understand
why
his
return
kiss
lacked
warmth
sun
been
up
two
hours
he
announced
and
the
hosses
have
had
a
good
rest
we
better
be
goin
what
are
you
climbing
the
tree
for
then
she
demanded
i
want
to
look
over
our
back
trail
he
told
her
clambering
into
the
branches
of
a
tall
cedar
i
know
we
covered
a
whole
heap
of
ground
last
night
but
you
never
can
tell
apparently
you
never
could
tell
for
when
he
arrived
near
the
top
of
the
cedar
and
looked
out
across
a
sea
of
treetops
to
the
flat
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
he
saw
that
which
made
him
catch
his
breath
and
slide
earthward
in
a
hurry
what
is
it
asked
molly
in
alarm
at
his
expression
they
picked
up
our
trail
somehow
he
answered
whipping
up
a
blanket
and
saddle
and
throwing
both
on
her
horse
they
about
three
miles
back
on
the
flat
just
the
ground
saddle
your
own
horse
she
cried
running
to
his
side
i
attend
to
mine
you
stuff
all
the
papers
back
in
the
sack
that
yore
job
hustle
now
i
get
you
out
of
this
do
worry
i
not
worrying
not
a
worry
she
said
cheerfully
both
hands
busy
with
luke
tweezy
papers
i
like
to
know
how
they
picked
up
the
trail
after
our
riding
up
that
creek
for
six
miles
i
dunno
said
he
his
head
under
an
upflung
i
shore
thought
we
lost
she
stopped
tying
the
sack
and
looked
at
him
how
silly
we
are
she
cried
all
we
have
to
do
is
show
these
two
letters
to
the
posse
an
now
the
posse
is
led
by
jack
harpe
and
jakey
pooley
said
he
not
ceasing
to
pass
the
cinch
strap
her
face
fell
i
never
thought
of
that
she
admitted
but
there
must
be
some
honest
men
in
the
bunch
it
takes
a
whole
lot
to
convince
an
honest
man
when
he
part
of
a
posse
racey
declared
reaching
for
the
bran
sack
they
do
stop
to
reason
a
posse
do
and
this
lot
of
marysville
gents
give
us
time
to
explain
these
two
letters
and
before
they
got
us
back
to
town
the
two
letters
would
disappear
and
then
where
would
we
be
we
be
in
jail
and
like
to
stay
awhile
let
get
out
of
here
exclaimed
molly
crawling
her
horse
even
quicker
than
racey
did
his
racey
led
the
way
along
the
mountain
side
for
three
or
four
miles
most
of
the
time
they
rode
at
a
gallop
and
all
the
time
they
took
care
to
keep
under
cover
of
the
trees
this
necessitated
frequent
zigzags
for
the
trees
grew
sparsely
in
spots
there
a
slide
ahead
a
ways
racey
shouted
to
the
girl
nearly
a
wide
and
over
two
miles
long
so
we
have
to
take
a
chance
and
cross
it
molly
nodded
her
head
and
racey
snatched
a
wistful
glance
at
the
face
he
loved
renunciation
was
in
his
eyes
for
that
second
letter
found
caught
in
the
bran
sack
seam
had
changed
things
he
could
not
marry
her
no
not
now
and
yet
he
loved
her
more
than
ever
she
looked
at
him
and
smiled
and
he
smiled
back
crookedly
what
the
matter
she
cried
above
the
drum
of
the
flying
hoofs
nothing
he
shouted
back
he
hoped
she
believed
him
and
bitter
almonds
were
not
as
bitter
as
that
hope
then
the
wide
expanse
of
the
slide
was
before
them
now
some
slides
have
trails
across
their
unstable
backs
and
some
have
not
some
are
utterly
unsafe
to
cross
and
others
can
be
crossed
with
small
risk
there
was
no
trail
across
this
particular
slide
and
it
did
not
present
a
dangerous
appearance
neither
does
quicksand
till
you
step
on
it
racey
dismounted
at
the
edge
and
started
across
leading
his
horse
twenty
yards
in
the
rear
molly
dale
followed
in
like
manner
at
every
step
the
footing
gave
a
little
once
a
rounded
rock
dislodged
by
the
forefoot
of
racey
horse
bounded
away
down
the
long
slope
the
slither
of
a
started
rock
behind
him
made
him
turn
his
head
with
a
jerk
molly
horse
was
down
on
its
knees
easy
boy
easy
soothed
molly
coaxingly
keeping
the
bridle
reins
taut
the
horse
scrambled
up
and
plunged
forward
and
almost
overran
molly
she
seized
it
short
by
the
the
horse
pawed
nervously
and
tried
to
rear
more
rocks
skidded
downward
under
the
shove
of
the
hind
hoofs
to
racey
imagination
the
whole
slide
seemed
to
tremble
molly
face
when
the
horse
finally
quieted
and
she
turned
around
was
pale
and
drawn
which
was
not
surprising
it
all
right
it
all
right
it
all
right
racey
found
himself
repeating
with
stiff
lips
of
course
it
is
nodded
molly
bravely
there
no
danger
no
said
racey
better
not
hold
him
so
short
do
wind
that
rein
round
yore
wrist
he
goes
down
you
go
too
here
you
lem
me
take
him
i
manage
him
all
right
i
manage
him
all
right
myself
snapped
molly
up
in
arms
immediately
at
this
slur
upon
her
horsemanship
you
go
on
racey
turned
and
went
on
it
was
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
to
where
the
grass
grew
on
firm
ground
racey
and
his
horse
reached
solid
earth
without
incident
then
a
scramble
a
scraping
and
a
clattering
followed
in
a
breath
by
the
indescribable
sound
of
a
mass
of
rocks
in
motion
racey
had
wasted
no
time
in
looking
to
see
what
had
happened
he
knew
at
the
first
sound
of
disaster
he
had
snapped
his
rope
strap
freed
his
rope
and
taken
two
half
hitches
round
the
horn
then
he
leaped
toward
the
slide
shaking
out
his
rope
as
he
went
twenty
feet
out
and
below
him
molly
dale
and
her
struggling
horse
were
sliding
downward
if
the
horse
had
remained
quiet
but
the
horse
was
not
remaining
quiet
and
molly
wrist
was
tangled
in
the
bridle
reins
in
the
beginning
the
movement
was
slow
but
as
racey
reached
the
edge
of
the
slide
an
extra
strong
plunge
of
the
horse
drove
both
girl
and
animal
downward
two
yards
in
a
breath
molly
turned
a
white
face
upward
so
long
racey
she
called
bravely
and
waved
her
free
hand
but
racey
was
going
down
to
her
with
his
rope
in
one
hand
with
the
other
hand
and
his
teeth
he
was
opening
his
the
loose
stones
skittered
round
his
ankles
and
turned
under
his
boot
soles
he
took
tremendous
steps
and
with
that
white
face
below
him
lived
an
age
between
each
step
grab
the
rope
above
my
hand
he
yelled
although
by
now
she
was
not
a
yard
from
him
racey
was
closer
to
the
end
of
his
rope
than
he
realized
at
the
instant
that
her
free
hand
clutched
at
the
rope
it
tightened
with
a
jerk
as
the
cow
pony
at
the
other
end
feeling
the
strain
and
knowing
his
business
braced
his
legs
and
swayed
backward
molly
fingers
brushed
the
back
of
racey
hand
and
swept
down
his
arm
well
it
was
for
him
that
he
had
taken
two
turns
round
his
wrist
for
her
forearm
went
round
his
neck
and
almost
the
whole
downward
pull
of
girl
and
horse
exerted
itself
against
the
strength
of
racey
dawson
arm
and
shoulder
muscles
molly
face
and
chin
were
pressed
tightly
against
racey
neck
small
blame
to
her
if
her
eyes
were
closed
the
arm
held
fast
by
the
bridle
was
cruelly
stretched
and
twisted
and
where
the
rein
was
tight
across
the
back
of
her
wrist
for
he
could
reach
no
lower
racey
set
the
blade
of
his
and
sawed
desperately
it
was
not
a
sharp
knife
and
the
leather
was
tough
the
steel
did
not
bite
well
racey
sawed
all
the
harder
his
left
arm
felt
as
if
it
were
being
wrenched
out
of
its
socket
the
sweat
was
pouring
down
his
face
his
hat
jumped
from
his
head
he
did
not
even
wonder
why
he
must
cut
that
bridle
rein
in
two
he
must
he
must
snap
three
parts
cut
the
leather
parted
molly
left
arm
and
racey
right
fell
limply
molly
horse
went
down
the
slide
alone
neither
of
them
saw
it
go
molly
had
fainted
and
racey
was
too
spent
to
do
more
than
catch
her
round
the
waist
and
hold
her
to
him
in
time
to
prevent
her
following
the
horse
smack
something
small
and
hot
sprinkled
racey
cheek
he
looked
to
the
left
on
a
rock
face
close
by
was
a
splash
of
lead
smack
diminuendo
as
a
bullet
struck
the
side
of
a
rock
and
buzzed
off
at
an
angle
racey
turned
his
head
abruptly
at
a
place
where
trees
grew
thinly
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
slide
and
at
a
considerably
lower
altitude
than
the
spot
where
he
and
molly
hung
at
the
end
of
their
rope
shreds
of
gray
smoke
were
dissolving
into
the
atmosphere
the
range
was
possibly
seven
hundred
yards
the
hidden
marksman
was
a
good
shot
to
drive
his
bullets
as
close
as
he
had
at
that
distance
straight
out
from
the
place
of
gray
smoke
four
men
and
four
horses
were
making
their
way
across
the
slide
they
were
halfway
across
but
they
had
stopped
the
down
rush
of
molly
horse
had
apparently
given
them
pause
now
two
men
started
ahead
one
stood
irresolute
and
one
started
to
retrace
his
steps
it
is
a
true
saying
that
he
who
hesitates
is
lost
straight
over
the
irresolute
man
and
his
horse
rolled
the
dust
cloud
whose
centre
was
molly
horse
when
the
dust
cloud
passed
on
it
was
much
larger
and
both
the
man
and
his
horse
had
disappeared
the
man
who
had
started
to
retreat
continued
to
retreat
and
more
rapidly
the
two
who
had
held
on
did
not
cease
to
advance
but
they
proceeded
very
slowly
if
that
feller
with
the
winchester
do
get
us
we
all
right
for
a
spell
racey
muttered
he
knew
that
on
their
side
of
the
slide
for
a
distance
of
several
hundred
yards
up
and
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
for
several
miles
athwart
it
the
underbrush
was
impenetrable
for
horses
and
wicked
travelling
for
men
there
had
been
a
forest
fire
four
years
before
and
everyone
knows
what
happens
after
that
in
but
one
place
where
a
ridge
of
rock
reared
through
the
soil
was
it
possible
to
cross
the
stretch
of
ground
naturally
racey
had
picked
this
one
spot
whether
the
posse
had
not
known
of
this
rock
ridge
or
whether
they
had
simply
miscalculated
its
position
it
is
impossible
to
say
those
two
will
shore
be
out
of
luck
when
they
get
in
among
the
stubs
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
waited
for
his
strength
to
come
back
but
youth
recovers
quickly
and
racey
was
young
it
may
be
that
the
lead
that
was
being
sent
at
him
and
molly
dale
was
a
potent
revivifier
certainly
within
three
or
four
minutes
after
he
had
cut
the
bridle
racey
began
to
work
his
way
up
the
rope
to
where
his
patient
and
horse
stood
braced
and
steady
as
the
proverbial
boulder
monotonously
the
man
behind
the
winchester
whipped
bullet
after
bullet
into
the
rocky
face
of
the
slide
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
racey
dawson
and
the
senseless
burden
in
the
crook
of
his
left
arm
nevertheless
racey
took
the
time
to
work
to
the
right
and
recover
the
hat
that
a
bullet
had
flicked
from
his
head
then
he
resumed
his
slow
journey
upward
ages
passed
before
he
felt
the
good
firm
ground
under
his
feet
and
laid
the
still
unconscious
molly
on
the
grass
behind
a
gray
and
barkless
windfall
that
had
once
been
a
fir
then
he
removed
his
horse
farther
back
among
the
stubs
where
it
could
not
be
seen
took
his
winchester
from
the
scabbard
under
the
left
fender
and
went
back
to
the
edge
of
the
slide
to
start
a
return
argument
with
the
individual
who
had
for
the
last
ten
minutes
been
endeavouring
to
kill
him
chapter
xxix
hue
and
cry
did
you
hit
him
i
do
think
so
replied
racey
without
turning
his
head
keep
down
i
am
down
how
you
feel
pretty
good
considering
close
squeak
considerin
yes
said
she
in
a
small
voice
it
was
a
close
squeak
you
you
saved
my
life
racey
shucks
he
said
much
embarrassed
that
was
anythin
i
mean
you
you
know
what
i
mean
surely
i
know
what
you
mean
all
the
same
you
saved
my
life
tell
me
was
that
man
shooting
at
us
all
the
time
after
i
fainted
until
you
got
me
under
cover
not
all
the
time
no
but
most
of
the
time
oh
you
can
make
small
of
it
but
you
were
very
brave
it
is
everybody
would
have
stuck
the
way
you
did
smack
tchuck
a
bullet
struck
a
rock
two
feet
below
where
racey
lay
on
his
stomach
his
poked
out
between
two
shrubs
of
smooth
sumac
another
bored
the
hole
of
a
gray
stub
at
his
back
he
fired
quickly
at
the
first
puff
of
smoke
then
sent
two
bullets
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
centre
of
the
second
puff
not
much
chance
of
hittin
the
first
feller
he
said
to
molly
behind
a
log
but
that
second
sport
is
behind
a
bush
same
as
me
huh
oh
i
all
right
i
got
the
ground
in
front
of
me
he
has
alla
same
we
ai
stayin
here
any
longer
i
think
i
saw
gents
cuttin
across
the
end
of
the
slide
give
time
and
they
cut
in
behind
us
which
ai
part
of
my
plans
let
go
he
crawfished
backward
on
his
hands
and
knees
molly
followed
his
example
when
they
were
sufficiently
far
back
to
be
able
to
stand
upright
with
safety
they
scrambled
to
their
feet
and
hurried
to
the
horse
i
lead
him
for
a
while
said
racey
giving
molly
a
leg
up
for
the
horse
was
a
tall
one
he
wo
have
to
carry
double
just
yet
so
with
racey
walking
ahead
they
resumed
their
retreat
the
ridge
of
rock
cutting
across
the
area
could
not
properly
be
called
rimrock
it
was
a
different
formation
set
at
an
angle
it
climbed
steadily
upward
to
the
very
top
of
the
mountain
in
places
weatherworn
to
a
slippery
smoothness
in
others
jagged
where
the
rain
had
washed
an
upon
the
rock
the
cheerful
kinnikinick
spread
its
mantle
of
shining
green
the
man
and
the
girl
and
the
horse
made
good
time
racey
feet
began
to
hurt
before
he
had
gone
a
mile
but
he
knew
that
something
besides
a
pair
of
feet
would
be
irreparably
damaged
if
he
did
not
keep
going
if
they
caught
him
he
would
be
lynched
that
what
he
would
be
if
he
were
shot
first
and
the
girl
well
she
would
get
at
the
least
ten
years
at
piegan
city
they
were
caught
but
if
is
the
longest
and
tallest
word
in
the
dictionary
it
is
indeed
a
mighty
barrier
before
the
lord
did
you
ever
stop
to
think
they
may
come
up
through
this
brush
said
molly
on
whom
the
silence
and
the
sad
gray
stubs
on
either
hand
were
beginning
to
tell
no
he
answered
i
did
because
they
ca
the
farther
down
you
go
the
worse
it
gets
they
never
get
through
not
with
hosses
all
right
are
we
she
stood
up
in
her
stirrups
and
looked
down
through
a
vista
between
the
stubs
they
had
reached
the
top
of
the
mountain
it
was
a
mountain
and
they
were
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
eastern
hump
far
below
was
a
narrow
valley
running
north
and
south
it
was
a
valley
without
trees
or
stream
and
through
it
a
string
of
dots
were
slipping
to
the
north
are
we
all
right
she
persisted
look
down
there
at
this
he
turned
his
head
and
craned
his
neck
i
guess
he
said
stepping
out
we
better
boil
this
kettle
a
faster
she
made
no
comment
but
always
she
looked
down
the
mountain
side
and
watched
when
the
stubs
gave
her
the
opportunity
that
ominous
string
of
dots
she
had
never
been
hunted
before
they
crossed
the
top
of
the
mountain
keeping
to
the
ridge
of
rock
and
started
down
the
northern
slope
here
they
passed
out
of
the
area
of
underbrush
and
stubs
and
scuffed
through
brushless
groves
of
fir
and
spruce
where
no
grass
grew
and
not
a
ray
of
sunshine
struck
the
ground
and
the
wind
soughed
always
mournfully
but
here
and
there
were
comparatively
open
spaces
grassy
drenched
with
sunshine
and
sparsely
sprinkled
with
lovely
mountain
maples
and
solitary
yellow
pines
in
the
wider
open
spaces
they
could
see
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
below
them
and
catch
glimpses
of
the
way
they
must
go
a
deep
notch
almost
a
cañon
grown
up
in
spruce
divided
the
mountain
they
were
descending
from
the
next
one
to
the
north
this
next
one
thrust
a
rocky
shoulder
easterly
the
valley
where
the
horsemen
rode
bent
round
this
shoulder
in
a
curve
measured
in
miles
they
could
not
see
the
riders
now
there
a
trail
just
over
the
hill
said
racey
nodding
toward
the
mountain
across
the
notch
it
ai
been
regularly
used
since
the
daisy
petered
out
in
but
i
guess
the
bridge
is
all
right
and
suppose
it
ai
all
right
we
have
to
grow
wings
in
a
hurry
he
said
soberly
thinking
of
the
deep
cleft
spanned
by
the
bridge
does
this
trail
lead
to
farewell
same
thing
it
take
us
to
the
farewell
trail
if
we
wanted
to
go
there
but
we
do
we
ai
got
time
we
stick
to
this
trail
till
we
get
out
of
the
and
then
we
head
northeast
for
the
that
the
nearest
place
where
i
got
friends
and
i
do
mind
saying
we
be
needing
friends
bad
me
and
you
both
suppose
that
posse
reaches
the
trail
and
the
bridge
before
we
do
oh
i
guess
they
wo
they
have
to
go
alla
way
round
and
we
go
straight
mostly
do
you
worry
we
make
the
riffle
yet
his
voice
was
more
confident
than
his
brain
it
was
touch
and
go
whether
they
would
reach
the
trail
and
the
bridge
first
the
posse
in
the
valley
that
was
what
would
stack
the
cards
against
them
and
if
they
should
pass
the
bridge
first
what
then
it
was
at
least
thirty
miles
from
the
bridge
to
the
and
there
was
only
one
horse
indeed
the
close
squeak
was
still
squeaking
racey
you
limping
not
me
he
lied
stubbed
my
toe
thassall
nothing
of
the
kind
it
those
tight
boots
here
you
ride
and
let
me
walk
so
saying
she
slipped
to
the
ground
as
was
natural
the
horse
stopped
with
a
jerk
so
did
racey
you
get
into
that
saddle
he
directed
sternly
we
ai
got
time
for
any
foolishness
foolishness
and
she
was
only
trying
to
be
thoughtful
foolishness
she
turned
and
climbed
back
into
the
saddle
and
sat
up
straight
her
backbone
as
stiff
as
a
ramrod
and
looked
over
his
head
and
far
away
for
the
moment
she
was
so
hopping
mad
she
forgot
the
danger
they
were
in
they
made
their
way
down
into
the
heavy
growth
of
engelmann
spruce
that
filled
the
notch
crossed
the
floor
of
the
notch
and
began
again
to
climb
an
hour
later
they
crossed
the
top
of
the
second
mountain
and
saw
far
below
them
a
long
saddle
back
split
in
the
middle
by
a
narrow
cleft
at
that
distance
it
looked
very
narrow
in
reality
it
was
forty
feet
wide
racey
stopped
and
swept
with
squinting
eyes
the
place
where
he
knew
the
bridge
to
be
see
he
said
suddenly
pointing
for
molly
benefit
there
the
daisy
trail
i
can
see
her
plain
to
the
left
of
that
arrowhead
bunch
of
trees
and
the
bridge
is
behind
the
trees
but
i
do
see
any
trail
grown
up
in
grass
that
why
it
behind
the
trees
mostly
anyhow
but
she
there
the
trail
is
you
can
bet
on
it
i
do
want
to
bet
on
it
shortly
she
was
still
mad
at
him
he
had
saved
her
life
he
had
succeeded
in
saving
the
family
ranch
he
had
put
her
under
eternal
obligations
but
he
had
called
her
thought
for
him
foolishness
it
was
too
much
yet
all
the
time
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
she
knew
that
she
was
small
and
mean
and
narrow
and
deserved
a
spanking
if
any
girl
did
she
wanted
to
cuff
racey
cuff
him
till
his
ears
turned
red
and
his
head
rang
for
that
is
the
way
a
woman
feels
when
she
loves
a
man
and
he
has
hurt
her
feelings
but
she
feels
almost
precisely
the
same
way
when
she
hates
one
who
has
truth
it
is
that
love
and
hate
are
close
akin
down
down
they
dropped
two
thousand
feet
and
when
they
came
out
upon
the
fairly
level
top
of
the
saddle
back
racey
mounted
behind
molly
he
have
to
carry
double
now
he
explained
she
two
mile
to
the
bridge
and
my
wind
ai
good
enough
to
run
me
two
mile
it
was
not
his
wind
that
was
weak
it
was
his
feet
his
tortured
blistered
feet
that
were
two
flaming
aches
later
they
would
become
numb
he
wished
they
were
numb
now
and
cursed
silently
the
man
who
first
invented
cowboy
boots
every
jog
of
the
trotting
horse
whose
back
he
bestrode
was
a
twitching
torture
we
be
at
the
bridge
in
another
mile
he
told
her
thank
heaven
silent
and
lay
the
daisy
trail
when
they
came
out
upon
it
winding
through
a
meagre
plantation
of
cedars
no
one
come
along
yet
vouchsafed
racey
turning
into
the
trail
after
a
swift
glance
at
its
trackless
undisturbed
surface
he
tickled
the
horse
with
both
spurs
and
stirred
him
into
a
gallop
there
was
not
much
spring
in
that
gallop
racey
weighed
fully
one
hundred
and
seventy
pounds
without
his
clothes
molly
a
hundred
and
twenty
with
all
of
hers
and
the
saddle
blanket
sack
rifle
and
cartridges
weighed
a
good
sixty
on
top
of
this
weight
pile
many
weary
miles
the
horse
had
travelled
since
its
last
meal
and
you
have
what
it
was
carrying
no
wonder
the
gallop
lacked
spring
bridge
is
just
beyond
those
trees
said
racey
in
molly
ear
the
horse
is
nearly
run
out
was
her
comment
he
ai
dead
yet
they
rocked
around
the
arrowhead
grove
of
trees
and
saw
the
bridge
before
them
one
stringer
there
had
been
two
stringers
and
adequate
flooring
when
racey
had
seen
it
last
the
snows
of
the
previous
winter
must
have
been
heavy
in
the
mountains
molly
shivered
at
the
sight
of
that
lone
stringer
the
horse
is
done
and
so
are
we
she
muttered
nothing
like
that
he
told
her
cheerfully
there
one
stringer
left
good
enough
for
a
squirrel
let
alone
two
white
folks
i
i
could
shuddered
molly
they
had
stopped
at
the
bridge
head
racey
had
dismounted
and
she
was
looking
down
into
the
dark
mouth
of
the
cleft
with
frightened
eyes
it
must
be
five
hundred
feet
to
the
bottom
she
whispered
her
chin
wobbling
not
more
than
four
hundred
he
said
reassuringly
and
that
log
is
a
good
strong
log
and
she
been
shaved
off
with
the
broadaxe
for
layin
the
flooring
so
we
got
a
nice
smooth
path
almost
two
feet
wide
in
reality
that
smooth
path
retained
not
a
few
of
the
spikes
that
had
once
held
the
flooring
and
it
was
no
more
than
eighteen
inches
wide
racey
gabbled
on
regardless
if
chatter
would
do
it
he
get
her
mind
off
that
drop
i
breathed
molly
i
walk
across
on
that
i
fall
off
i
know
i
would
you
ai
gon
na
walk
across
the
log
he
told
her
with
a
broad
grin
i
carry
you
pickaback
molly
slide
off
that
right
now
when
i
stoop
put
yore
arms
round
my
neck
i
stick
my
arms
under
yore
legs
see
like
this
now
yo
all
right
do
worry
i
drop
you
close
yore
eyes
and
sit
still
and
you
never
know
happening
close
now
while
i
walk
round
with
you
a
bit
to
get
the
hang
of
carryin
you
she
closed
her
eyes
and
he
began
to
walk
about
carrying
her
at
least
she
thought
he
was
walking
about
but
when
he
stopped
and
she
opened
her
eyes
she
discovered
that
the
horse
was
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
cleft
at
first
she
did
not
understand
how
on
earth
did
the
horse
get
over
she
asked
in
wonder
he
did
racey
said
quietly
setting
her
down
but
we
did
i
carried
you
across
while
you
had
yore
eyes
shut
i
told
you
never
know
what
was
happenin
she
sat
down
limply
on
the
ground
racey
started
back
across
the
stringer
to
get
the
horse
he
hurried
too
that
posse
they
had
seen
in
the
valley
there
was
no
telling
where
it
was
it
might
be
four
miles
away
or
four
hundred
yards
feller
said
racey
picking
up
the
reins
of
the
tired
horse
and
for
gawd
sake
pick
up
yore
feet
if
you
do
that
dynamite
is
gon
na
make
one
awful
mess
at
the
bottom
of
the
cañon
dynamite
mess
there
was
an
idea
although
in
order
to
spare
molly
an
extra
worry
for
the
time
being
he
had
told
her
they
would
push
on
together
it
had
been
his
intention
to
hold
the
bridge
with
his
rifle
while
molly
rode
alone
to
the
for
help
but
those
six
sticks
of
dynamite
would
simplify
the
complex
situation
without
difficulty
he
did
not
hurry
the
horse
he
merely
walked
in
front
holding
the
bridle
slackly
the
horse
followed
him
as
good
as
gold
and
picked
up
his
feet
at
nearly
every
spike
once
or
twice
a
hind
hoof
grazed
a
with
a
rasping
sound
that
sent
racey
heart
bouncing
up
into
his
throat
lord
so
much
depended
on
a
safe
passage
for
the
first
time
in
his
eventful
life
racey
dawson
realized
that
he
possessed
a
full
and
working
set
of
nerves
when
they
reached
firm
ground
racey
flung
the
reins
to
molly
unpack
the
dynamite
he
cried
it
in
the
slicker
with
his
bowie
he
began
furiously
to
dig
under
the
end
of
the
stringer
where
it
lay
embedded
in
the
earth
within
ten
minutes
he
had
a
hole
large
enough
and
long
enough
to
thrust
in
the
whole
of
his
arm
he
made
it
a
little
longer
and
a
little
wider
and
at
the
end
he
drove
an
offset
this
last
that
there
might
be
no
risk
of
the
charge
blowing
out
through
the
hole
when
the
hole
was
to
his
liking
he
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
grabbed
the
dynamite
sticks
molly
held
out
to
him
with
strings
cut
from
his
saddle
he
tied
the
sticks
into
a
bundle
then
he
prepared
his
fuse
and
cap
in
one
of
the
sticks
he
made
a
hole
in
this
hole
he
firmly
inserted
the
copper
cap
above
the
cap
he
tied
the
fuse
to
the
bundle
with
several
lappings
of
a
there
he
exclaimed
i
guess
that
cap
will
stay
put
you
and
the
hoss
get
out
of
here
molly
go
along
the
trail
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
or
so
get
a
move
on
i
be
with
you
in
a
minute
better
leave
my
rifle
molly
laid
the
winchester
on
the
grass
beside
him
mounted
the
horse
and
departed
reluctantly
she
did
not
like
to
leave
racey
now
she
had
burned
out
her
mad
she
rode
away
chin
on
shoulder
the
cedars
swallowed
her
up
racey
with
careful
caution
stuffed
the
dynamite
down
the
hole
and
into
the
offset
then
he
shovelled
in
the
earth
with
his
hands
and
tamped
it
down
with
a
rock
was
that
the
clack
of
a
hoof
on
stone
faint
and
far
away
another
hoof
clacked
he
reached
up
to
his
hatband
for
a
match
there
were
no
matches
in
his
hatband
feverishly
he
searched
his
pockets
not
a
match
not
a
match
anywhere
he
whipped
out
his
sixshooter
held
the
muzzle
close
to
the
end
of
the
fuse
and
fired
he
had
to
fire
three
times
before
the
fuse
began
to
sparkle
and
spit
clearly
it
came
to
his
ears
the
unmistakable
thudding
of
galloping
hoofs
on
turf
the
posse
was
riding
for
the
bridge
full
tilt
he
picked
up
his
rifle
and
dodged
in
among
the
trees
along
the
trail
forty
yards
from
the
mined
stringer
he
met
molly
riding
back
with
a
scared
face
what
is
it
she
cried
to
him
i
heard
shots
oh
what
is
it
go
back
go
back
he
bawled
i
only
cut
that
fuse
for
three
minutes
molly
wheeled
the
horse
and
fled
racey
ran
to
where
a
windfall
lay
near
the
edge
of
the
cleft
and
some
forty
yards
from
the
stringer
behind
the
windfall
he
lay
down
levered
a
cartridge
into
the
chamber
and
trained
his
rifle
on
the
bridge
head
the
galloping
horsemen
were
not
a
hundred
paces
from
the
stringer
when
the
dynamite
let
go
with
a
roar
rocks
earth
chunks
and
splinters
of
wood
flew
up
in
advance
of
a
rolling
cloud
of
smoke
that
obscured
the
cleft
from
rim
to
rim
a
crash
at
the
bottom
of
the
narrow
cañon
told
racey
what
had
happened
to
that
part
of
the
stringer
the
dynamite
had
not
destroyed
racey
lowered
the
hammer
of
his
rifle
to
the
safety
notch
just
as
the
posse
began
to
approach
the
spot
where
the
bridge
had
been
it
approached
on
foot
by
ones
and
twos
and
from
tree
to
tree
racey
could
not
see
any
one
but
he
could
see
the
tree
branches
move
here
and
there
i
guess
muttered
racey
as
he
crawfished
away
from
the
windfall
i
guess
that
settles
the
the
sun
was
near
its
rising
the
following
day
when
racey
and
molly
their
one
horse
staggering
with
fatigue
reached
the
racey
had
walked
all
the
distance
he
was
humanly
able
to
walk
but
even
so
the
horse
had
carried
double
the
better
part
of
twenty
miles
it
had
earned
a
rest
so
had
racey
feet
my
gawd
what
a
relief
racey
muttered
and
sat
back
and
gingerly
wiggled
his
toes
damn
shame

to
cut
up

scrabbled
sidewise
to
the
wall
and
shrank
against
it
his
eyes
were
wide
staring
they
were
fixed
on
the
doorway
behind
pooley
i
did
do

mcfluke
thrusting
out
his

before

did
it
all

lie
i
did
kill
him
fat
jacob
pooley
whirled
to
face
three
guns
his
right
hand
fell
away
reluctantly
from
the
butt
of
his
sixshooter
slowly
his
arms
went
above
his
head
racey
dawson
and
his
two
companions
entered
the
room
the
eldest
of
these
companions
was
one
of
the
piegan
city
town
marshals
he
was
a
friend
of
jacob
pooley
but
there
was
no
friendliness
in
his
face
as
he
approached
the
register
removed
his
gun
and
searched
his
person
for
other
weapons
jacob
pooley
said
nothing
his
face
was
a
dark
red
the
marshal
produced
a
pair
of
handcuffs
the
register
recoiled
not
those
he
protested
do
put
handcuffs
on
me
put
yore
hands
down
ordered
the
marshal
look
here
i
go
quietly
i
put
yore
hands
repeated
the
inexorable
marshal
jacob
pooley
put
his
hands
down
racey
and
the
other
man
were
handcuffing
mcfluke
who
was
keeping
up
an
incessant
wail
of
i
did
do

i
did

racey
jerking
the
prisoner
to
his

much
where
yore
wells
fargo
and
pinkerton
detectives
demanded
pooley
this

racey
indicating
the
man
who
had
helped

handcuff
mcfluke
there
ai
any
pinkerton
within
five
hundred
miles
so
far
as
i

game
and
then

of
yore

and
trailed
you
you
ca
prove

bluffed
pooley
we
were
here
beside
the
door
listenin
from
the
time
mcfluke
said
he
was
too
comfortable
to
move
out
of
here
thus
the
marshal
wearily
pooley
considered
a
moment
who
snitched
where
mac
was
he
asked
finally
nobody
replied
racey
promptly
somebody
must
have
who
was
it
nobody
i
tell
you
mcfluke
had
to
go
somewhere
did
he
he
could
hang
around
farewell
too
dangerous
but
the
chances
were
he
would
leave
the
country
complete
till
he
got
his
share
and
as
nothing
had
come
off
it
was
any
likely
he
got
his
share
so
want
to
keep
in
touch
with
his
friends
till
the
deal
was
put
through
it
was
only
natural
he
drift
to
you
and
when

come
here
to

you
had
hired
a
man
to
live
on
yore
claim

then

a
look
at
him
without
him
knowing

the
rest
was
easy

what
had
transpired
that
day
in
the
hotel
corral
when
he
had
been
bandaging
his
horse
leg
and
had
overheard
the
conversation
between
lanpher
and
jack
harpe
and
later
thompson
they
nothing
in
that
declared
jack
harpe
with
contempt
twisting
his
neck
to
glower
up
at
racey
suppose
i
did
wan
na
get
hold
of
the
dale
ranch
what
of
it
shore

in
luke
tweezy
what
of
it
perfectly
legitimate
business
proposition
legal
and
all
that
not
quite
denied
racey
not
the
way
you
went
about
it
nawsir
well
gents
he
resumed
what
i
heard
in
that
corral
showed
plain
enough
there
was
something
up
dale
would
sell
and
they
were
bound
to
get
his
land
away
from
him
so
they
figured
to
have
nebraska
jones
turn
the
trick
by
playin
poker
with
the
old
man
when
nebraska
they
switched
from
nebraska
to
peaches
austin
plannin
to
go
through
with
the
deal
at
mcfluke
from
the
beginning
and
that
was
where
tweezy
come
in
he
was
to
get
the
old
man
to
mcfluke
and
with
the
help
of
peaches
austin
cheat
dale
out
of
the
ranch
that
a
damn
lie
cried
tweezy
i
suppose
you
deny
said
racey
that
the
day
i
saw
you
ride
in
here
to
farewell
i
mean
the
day
jack
harpe
spoke
to
you
in
front
of
the
happy
heart
and
you
did
answer
him
that
day
you
come
in
from
marysville
on
purpose
to
tell
jack
an
lanpher
about
the
mortgage
having
to
be
renewed
and
that
now
was
their
chance
i
suppose
deny
all
that
huh
yo
yo
lyin
sputtered
luke
tweezy
am
i
we
see
when
playin
cards
with
old
dale
did
work
they
caught
the
old
man
at
mcfluke
one
day
and
after
he
got
in
a
fight
with
mcfluke
and
mcfluke
downed
him
they
saw
their
chance
to
produce
a
forged
release
from
dale
who
did
the
forging
broke
in
the
judge
i
dunno
for
shore
this
here
was
found
in
tweezy
safe
he
held
out
a
letter
to
the
judge
judge
dolan
took
the
letter
and
read
it
carefully
then
he
looked
across
at
luke
tweezy
this
here
said
he
tapping
the
letter
with
stiffened
forefinger
is
a
signed
letter
from
dale
to
you
it
seems
to
be
a
reply
in
the
negative
to
a
letter
of
yores
askin
him
to
sell
his
ranch
the
judge
paused
and
glanced
round
the
room
then
his
cold
eyes
returned
to
the
face
of
luke
tweezy
who
was
beginning
to
look
extremely
wretched
underneath
the
signature
of
dale
continued
the
judge
somebody
has
copied
that
signature
some
fifty
or
sixty
times
i
wonder
why
i
dunno
anything
about
it
luke
tweezy
denied
feebly
we
come
back
to
that
the
judge
observed
softly
racey
i
figure
said
racey
that
they
hatched
that
forgery
some
while
before
dale
was
killed
the
killing
made
it
easier
to
put
it
on
record
looks
that
way
nodded
the
judge
lookit
here
boomed
jack
harpe
you
ai
got
any
right
to
judge
us
thisaway
we
ai
on
trial
shore
you
ai
asserted
the
judge
i
always
said
you
was
this
here
is
just
a
talk
a
friendly
talk
no
trial
about
it
here
another
letter
judge
said
racey
dawson
the
judge
read
the
other
letter
and
again
fixed
luke
tweezy
with
his
eye
this
ai
a
letter
exactly
said
judge
dolan
it
a
quadruplicate
copy
of
an
agreement
between
lanpher
of
the
ranch
jacob
pooley
of
piegan
city
and
luke
tweezy
of
marysville
parties
of
the
first
part
and
jack
harpe
party
of
the
second
part
to
buy
or
otherwise
obtain
possession
of
the
ranch
of
william
dale
in
the
northeast
corner
of
which
property
is
located
an
abandoned
mine
tunnel
in
which
jack
harpe
the
party
of
the
second
part
has
discovered
a
lode
a
mine
muttered
swing
tunstall
a
gold
mine
and
i
thought
they
wanted
it
for
a
ranch
so
did
i
racey
nodded
i
know
that
mine
said
jake
rule
silvertip
ransom
and
long
oscar
drove
the
tunnel
done
the
necessary
labour
got
their
patent
and
sold
out
when
they
could
get
day
wages
to
old
dale
for
one
pony
and
a
jack
but
dale
never
worked
it
a
payin
lode
hell
who
thought
it
old
salt
an
tom
loudon
got
a
couple
o
claims
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
from
dale
mine
put
in
kansas
casey
they
bought
off
of
slippery
wilson
and
his
wife
them
claims
oughta
be
right
valuable
now
they
are
nodded
judge
dolan
the
agreement
goes
on
to
say
that
jack
harpe
found
lodes
in
both
of
slippery
old
tunnels
that
these
claims
will
be
properly
relocated
and
registered
i
guess
that
where
jakey
pooley
come
in
and
all
three
mines
will
be
worked
by
a
company
made
up
of
these
four
men
each
man
to
receive
one
quarter
of
the
profits
this
agreement
is
signed
by
jack
harpe
simon
lanpher
and
jacob
pooley
and
after
pooley
was
arrested
contributed
racey
dawson
the
piegan
city
marshal
went
through
his
safe
and
found
the
original
of
this
agreement
signed
by
tweezy
lanpher
and
harpe
luke
tweezy
held
up
his
hand
one
moment
said
he
where
was
the
agreement
signed
by
harpe
pooley
and
lanpher
found
in
yore
safe
replied
racey
dawson
did
you
find
it
there
yep
what
were
you
doing
at
my
safe
now
do
get
excited
luke
i
happened
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
yore
house
in
marysville
about
a
month
ago
when
i
noticed
one
of
yore
back
windows
open
i
snooped
in
and
there
was
jack
harpe
working
on
yore
combination
with
jakey
pooley
watchin
him
jack
harpe
was
the
boy
who
opened
the
safe
huh
shore
i
know
him
and
jakey
pooley
sicked
posses
on
my
trail
why
not
they
hadda
cover
their
own
tracks
did
they
but
that
ai
the
point
what
i
ca
help
wondering
is
why
harpe
and
pooley
was
fussin
with
the
safe
in
the
first
place
what
do
you
guess
luke
evidently
tweezy
knew
the
answer
with
a
yelp
of
tried
to
cross
me
you
he
flung
himself
bodily
upon
jack
harpe
in
a
moment
the
two
were
rolling
on
the
floor
it
required
four
men
and
seven
minutes
to
pry
them
apart
chapter
xxxii
the
end
of
the
trail
molly
dale
looked
at
racey
with
adoring
eyes
how
on
earth
did
you
guess
that
the
bill
smith
who
robbed
the
wells
fargo
safe
at
keeleyville
and
killed
the
agent
was
jack
harpe
oh
that
was
nothing
you
see
i
heard
somebody
say
i
disremember
exactly
who
now
that
jack
harpe
real
name
was
bill
smith
that
shaved
off
his
beard
and
part
of
his
eyebrows
to
make
himself
look
different
and
that
he
done
something
against
the
law
to
some
company
in
some
town
i
did
know
what
company
nor
what
town
but
i
had
somethin
to
start
with
when
mcfluke
was
let
loose
i
figured
out
by
this
that
and
the
other
that
jack
harpe
had
let
mcfluke
loose
aw
right
that
showed
jack
harpe
was
a
expert
lock
picker
he
showed
us
at
marysville
that
he
was
a
expert
on
safe
combinations
now
there
ca
be
many
men
like
that
so
i
took
what
i
knew
about
him
to
the
detective
chiefs
of
three
railroads
he
done
somethin
against
a
company
do
you
see
and
of
course
i
went
to
three
different
companies
before
i
woke
up
and
went
to
the
wells
fargo
found
out
that
such
a
man
as
jack
harpe
named
bill
smith
was
wanted
for
the
keeleyville
job
so
you
see
there
was
much
to
it
it
was
all
there
waitin
for
somebody
to
find
it
but
it
lacked
the
somebody
till
you
came
along
she
told
him
with
shining
eyes
shucks
no
shucks
about
it
that
we
have
our
ranch
with
a
producing
gold
mine
in
one
corner
of
it
is
all
due
to
you
shucks
suppose
now
those
handwritin
experts
judge
dolan
got
from
chicago
had
been
able
to
prove
at
the
time
that
the
forgery
and
the
fifty
or
sixty
copies
of
yore
dad
name
were
written
by
the
same
hand
ink
and
pen
suppose
now
they
had
what
then
where
you
be
i
like
to
know
nawsir
you
give
them
the
credit
they
deserve
it
well
i
shore
glad
yo
all
gon
na
be
rich

time
i
thought

were
going
to

up
here
persisted
molly
her
cheeks
a
little
white
not
not
now
racey
said
hastily
so
long
take
care
of
yoreself
he
reached
for
her
hand
gave
it
a
quick
squeeze
then
picked
up
his
hat
and
walked
out
of
the
house
without
another
word
or
a
backward
look
what
makes
me
sick
is
not
a
cent
out
of
old
salt
said
racey
wrathfully
as
he
and
swing
tunstall
walked
their
horses
south
along
the
marysville
trail
what
else
could
you
expect
said
the
philosopher
swing
we
specified
in
the
agreement
that
it
was
cows
them
jiggers
was
gon
na
run
on
the
range
we
did
say
nothin
about
a
mine
repeated
racey
you
did
have
a
thing
to
do
with
that
agreement
i
made
it
it
was
my
fool
fault
we
worked
all
those
months
for
nothing
what
the
dif
swing
said
comfortably
we
partners
deal
yoreself
a
new
hand
and
forget
it
tough
luck
we
could
made
a
clean
sweep
of
that
bunch
huh
oh
i
dunno
suppose
peaches
nebraska
and
thompson
did
get
away
we
did
pretty
good
considerin
you
ca
expect
everything
alla
same
they
oughta
been
a
reward
for
jack
harpe
anyway
wells
fargo
is
shore
getting
mighty
jack
did
better
than
i
thought
he
would
he
never
opened
his
yap
about
marie
being
in
that
keeleyville
gang
maybe
he
did
know
for
shore
or
else
knowed
better
bull
was
in
that
gang
too
and
bull
got
his
throat
cut
if
jack
had
done
any
blattin
about
marie
and
keeleyville
he
might
had
to
stand
trial
for
murder
right
here
in
this
county
instead
of
going
down
to
new
mexico
to
be
tried
for
a
murder
committed
ten
years
ago
with
all
that
means
evidence
gone
rusty
with
age
and
witnesses
dead
or
in
jail
themselves
most
like
oh
he
be
convicted
but
it
wo
be
first
degree
you
can
stick
a
pin
in
that
i
wonder
if
he
did
kill
bull
i
wonder
too
didja
know
who
bull
really
was
swing
brother
yep
she
told
me
about
it
yesterday

huh
that

never
come
back
to
bother
her
again
that
a
cinch
who
that
ahead
that
was
molly
waiting
for
them
at
a
turn
in
the
trail
when
they
came
up
to
her
she
nodded
to
both
men
but
her
smile
was
all
for
racey
dawson
he
felt
his
pulse
begin
to
beat
a
trifle
faster
how
handsome
she
was
with
her
dark
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
at
the
moment
those
blue
eyes
that
were
looking
into
his
were
deep
enough
to
drown
a
man
can
i
see
you
a
minute
racey
said
she
swing
immediately
turned
his
horse
on
a
dime
and
loped
along
the
back
trail
left
alone
with
racey
she
moved
her
horse
closer
to
his
their
ankles
touched
his
hands
were
clasped
on
the
she
laid
her
cool
hand
on
top
of
them
racey
she
said
her
wonderful
eyes
holding
him

for

told
him
he
nodded
miserably

persisted
he

he
stared

at
the
back
of
the
hand
lying
on

of
