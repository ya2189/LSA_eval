chapter
i
i
hear
that
john
andrews
has
given
up
his
saloon
and
a
foolish
thing
it
was
he
was
doing
a
splendid
business
what
could
have
induced
him
they
say
that
his
wife
was
bitterly
opposed
to
the
business
i
know
but
i
think
it
quite
likely
she
has
never
seemed
happy
since
john
has
kept
saloon
well
i
would
never
let
any
woman
lead
me
by
the
nose
i
would
let
her
know
that
as
the
living
comes
by
me
the
way
of
getting
it
is
my
affair
not
hers
as
long
as
she
is
well
provided
for
all
men
are
not
alike
and
i
confess
that
i
value
the
peace
and
happiness
of
my
home
more
than
anything
else
and
i
would
not
like
to
engage
in
any
business
which
i
knew
was
a
source
of
constant
pain
to
my
wife
but
what
right
has
a
woman
to
complain
if
she
has
every
thing
she
wants
i
would
let
her
know
pretty
soon
who
holds
the
reins
if
i
had
such
an
unreasonable
creature
to
deal
with
i
think
as
much
of
my
wife
as
any
man
but
i
want
her
to
know
her
place
and
i
know
mine
what
do
you
call
her
place
i
call
her
place
staying
at
home
and
attending
to
her
own
affairs
were
i
a
laboring
man
i
would
never
want
my
wife
to
take
in
work
when
a
woman
has
too
much
on
hand
something
has
to
be
neglected
now
i
always
furnish
my
wife
with
sufficient
help
and
supply
every
want
but
how
i
get
the
living
and
where
i
go
and
what
company
i
keep
is
my
own
business
and
i
would
not
allow
the
best
woman
in
the
world
to
interfere
i
have
often
heard
women
say
that
they
did
not
care
what
their
husbands
did
so
that
they
provided
for
them
and
i
think
such
conclusions
are
very
sensible
well
john
i
do
not
think
so
i
think
a
woman
must
be
very
selfish
if
all
she
cares
for
her
husband
is
to
have
a
good
provider
i
think
her
husband
honor
and
welfare
should
be
as
dear
to
her
as
her
own
and
no
true
woman
and
wife
can
be
indifferent
to
the
moral
welfare
of
her
husband
neither
man
nor
woman
can
live
by
bread
alone
in
the
highest
and
best
sense
of
the
term
now
paul
do
go
to
preaching
you
have
always
got
some
moon
struck
theories
some
wild
visionary
and
impracticable
ideas
which
would
work
first
rate
if
men
were
angels
and
earth
a
paradise
now
do
be
so
serious
old
fellow
but
you
know
on
this
religion
business
you
and
i
always
part
company
you
are
always
up
in
the
clouds
while
i
am
trying
to
invest
in
a
few
acres
or
town
lots
of
solid
and
would
your
hold
on
earthly
possessions
be
less
firm
because
you
looked
beyond
the
seen
to
the
unseen
i
think
it
would
if
i
let
conscience
interfere
constantly
with
every
business
transaction
i
undertook
now
last
week
you
lost
fair
and
square
because
you
would
not
foreclose
that
mortgage
on
property
i
told
you
that
is
business
and
that
while
i
pitied
the
poor
man
i
would
not
have
risked
my
money
that
way
but
you
said
that
conscience
would
not
let
you
that
while
other
creditors
were
gathering
like
hungry
vultures
around
the
poor
man
you
would
not
join
with
them
and
that
you
did
not
believe
in
striking
a
man
when
he
is
down
now
paul
as
a
business
man
if
you
want
to
succeed
you
have
got
to
look
at
business
in
a
practical
common
sense
way
smith
is
dead
and
where
is
your
money
now
apparently
lost
but
the
time
may
come
when
i
shall
feel
that
it
was
one
of
the
best
investments
i
ever
made
stranger
things
than
that
have
happened
i
confess
that
i
felt
the
loss
and
it
has
somewhat
cramped
my
business
yet
if
it
was
to
do
over
again
i
do
think
that
i
would
act
differently
and
when
i
believe
that
smith
death
was
hurried
on
by
anxiety
and
business
troubles
while
i
regret
the
loss
of
my
money
i
am
thankful
that
i
did
not
press
my
claim
sour
grapes
but
you
are
right
to
put
the
best
face
on
matters
no
if
it
were
to
do
over
again
i
never
would
push
a
struggling
man
to
the
wall
when
he
was
making
a
desperate
fight
for
his
wife
and
little
ones
well
paul
we
are
both
young
men
just
commencing
life
and
my
motto
is
to
look
out
for
number
and
you
oh
i
believe
in
lending
a
helping
hand
so
do
i
when
i
can
make
every
corner
out
to
my
advantage
i
believe
in
every
man
looking
out
for
himself
you
will
see
by
the
dialogue
that
the
characters
i
here
introduce
are
the
antipodes
of
each
other
they
had
both
been
pupils
in
the
same
school
and
in
after
life
being
engaged
as
grocers
they
frequently
met
and
renewed
their
acquaintance
they
were
both
established
in
business
having
passed
the
threshold
of
that
important
event
setting
out
in
life
as
far
as
their
outward
life
was
concerned
they
were
acquaintances
but
to
each
other
inner
life
they
were
strangers
john
anderson
has
a
fine
robust
constitution
good
intellectual
abilities
and
superior
business
faculties
he
is
eager
keen
and
alert
and
if
there
is
one
article
of
faith
that
moulds
and
colors
all
his
life
more
than
anything
else
it
is
a
firm
and
unfaltering
belief
in
the
main
chance
he
has
made
up
his
mind
to
be
rich
and
his
highest
ideal
of
existence
may
be
expressed
in
four
words
on
in
to
this
object
he
is
ready
to
sacrifice
time
talent
energy
and
every
faculty
which
he
possesses
nay
he
will
go
farther
he
will
spend
honor
conscience
and
manhood
in
an
eager
search
for
gold
he
will
change
his
heart
into
a
ledger
on
which
he
will
write
and
loss
and
gain
exchange
and
barter
and
he
will
succeed
as
worldly
men
count
success
he
will
add
house
to
house
he
will
encompass
the
means
of
luxury
his
purse
will
be
plethoric
but
oh
how
poverty
stricken
his
soul
will
be
costly
viands
will
please
his
taste
but
unappeased
hunger
will
gnaw
at
his
soul
amid
the
blasts
of
winter
he
will
have
the
warmth
of
calcutta
in
his
home
and
the
health
of
the
ocean
and
the
breezes
of
the
mountains
shall
fan
his
brow
amid
the
heats
of
summer
but
there
will
be
a
coolness
in
his
soul
that
no
breath
of
summer
can
ever
dispel
a
fever
in
his
spirit
that
no
frozen
confection
can
ever
allay
he
shall
be
rich
in
lands
and
houses
but
fear
of
loss
and
a
sense
of
poverty
will
poison
the
fountains
of
his
life
and
unless
he
repent
he
shall
go
out
into
the
eternities
a
pauper
and
a
bankrupt
paul
clifford
whom
we
have
also
introduced
to
you
was
the
only
son
of
a
widow
whose
young
life
had
been
overshadowed
by
the
curse
of
intemperance
her
husband
a
man
of
splendid
abilities
and
magnificent
culture
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
wine
cup
with
true
womanly
devotion
she
had
clung
to
him
in
the
darkest
hours
until
death
had
broken
his
hold
in
life
and
he
was
laid
away
the
wreck
of
his
former
self
in
a
drunkard
grave
gathering
up
the
remains
of
what
had
been
an
ample
fortune
she
installed
herself
in
an
humble
and
unpretending
home
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
of
and
there
with
loving
solicitude
she
had
watched
over
and
superintended
the
education
of
her
only
son
he
was
a
promising
boy
full
of
life
and
vivacity
having
inherited
much
of
the
careless
joyousness
of
his
father
temperament
and
although
he
was
the
light
and
joy
of
his
home
yet
his
mother
sometimes
felt
as
if
her
heart
was
contracting
with
a
spasm
of
agony
when
she
remembered
that
it
was
through
that
same
geniality
of
disposition
and
wonderful
fascination
of
manner
the
tempter
had
woven
his
meshes
for
her
husband
and
that
the
qualities
that
made
him
so
desirable
at
home
made
him
equally
so
to
his
jovial
careless
inexperienced
companions
fearful
that
the
appetite
for
strong
drink
might
have
been
transmitted
to
her
child
as
a
fatal
legacy
of
sin
she
sedulously
endeavored
to
develop
within
him
self
control
feeling
that
the
lack
of
it
is
a
prolific
cause
of
misery
and
crime
and
she
spared
no
pains
to
create
within
his
mind
a
horror
of
intemperance
and
when
he
was
old
enough
to
understand
the
nature
of
a
vow
she
knelt
with
him
in
earnest
prayer
and
pledging
him
to
eternal
enmity
against
everything
that
would
intoxicate
whether
fermented
or
distilled
in
the
morning
she
sowed
the
seed
which
she
hoped
would
blossom
in
time
and
bear
fruit
throughout
eternity
chapter
ii
the
decision
i
hear
belle
said
jeanette
roland
addressing
her
cousin
belle
gordon
that
you
have
refused
an
excellent
offer
of
marriage
who
said
so
aunt
emma
i
am
very
sorry
that
ma
told
you
i
think
such
things
should
be
kept
sacred
from
comment
and
i
think
the
woman
is
wanting
in
refinement
and
delicacy
of
feeling
who
makes
the
rejection
of
a
lover
a
theme
for
conversation
now
you
dear
little
prude
i
had
no
idea
that
you
would
take
it
so
seriously
but
aunt
emma
was
so
disappointed
and
spoke
of
the
rejected
suitor
in
such
glowing
terms
and
said
that
you
had
sacrificed
a
splendid
opportunity
because
of
some
squeamish
notions
on
the
subject
of
temperance
and
so
of
course
my
dear
cousin
it
was
just
like
me
to
let
my
curiosity
overstep
the
bounds
of
prudence
and
inquire
why
you
rejected
mr
romaine
because
i
could
not
trust
him
could
trust
him
why
belle
you
are
a
greater
enigma
than
ever
why
not
because
i
feel
that
the
hands
of
a
moderate
drinker
are
not
steady
enough
to
hold
my
future
happiness
was
that
all
why
i
breathe
again
we
girls
would
have
to
refuse
almost
every
young
man
in
our
set
were
we
to
take
that
stand
and
suppose
you
were
would
that
be
any
greater
misfortune
than
to
be
the
wives
of
drunkards
i
do
see
the
least
danger
ma
has
wine
at
her
entertainments
and
i
have
often
handed
it
to
young
gentlemen
and
i
do
see
the
least
harm
in
it
on
last
new
year
day
we
had
more
than
fifty
callers
ma
and
i
handed
wine
to
every
one
of
them
oh
i
do
wish
people
would
abandon
that
pernicious
custom
of
handing
around
wine
on
new
year
day
i
do
think
it
is
a
dangerous
and
reprehensible
thing
wherein
lies
the
danger
of
course
i
do
not
approve
of
young
men
drinking
in
bar
rooms
and
saloons
but
i
can
not
see
any
harm
in
handing
round
wine
at
social
gatherings
not
to
do
so
would
seem
so
odd
it
is
said
jeanette
is
a
slave
who
does
not
be
in
the
right
with
two
or
three
it
is
better
wiser
far
to
stand
alone
in
our
integrity
than
to
join
with
the
multitude
in
doing
wrong
you
say
while
you
do
not
approve
of
young
men
drinking
in
bar
rooms
and
saloons
that
you
have
no
objection
to
their
drinking
beneath
the
shadow
of
their
homes
why
do
you
object
to
their
drinking
in
saloons
and
bar
rooms
because
it
is
vulgar
oh
i
think
these
bar
rooms
are
horrid
places
i
would
walk
squares
out
of
my
way
to
keep
from
passing
them
and
i
object
to
intemperance
not
simply
because
i
think
it
is
vulgar
but
because
i
know
it
is
wicked
and
jeanette
i
have
a
young
brother
for
whose
welfare
i
am
constantly
trembling
but
i
am
not
afraid
that
he
will
take
his
first
glass
of
wine
in
a
fashionable
saloon
or
flashy
gin
palace
but
i
do
dread
his
entrance
into
what
you
call
set
i
fear
that
my
brother
has
received
as
an
inheritance
a
temperament
which
will
be
easily
excited
by
stimulants
that
an
appetite
for
liquor
once
a
awakened
will
be
hard
to
subdue
and
i
am
so
fearful
that
at
some
social
gathering
a
thoughtless
girl
will
hand
him
a
glass
of
wine
and
that
the
first
glass
will
be
like
adding
fuel
to
a
smouldering
fire
oh
belle
do
stop
what
a
train
of
horrors
you
can
conjure
out
of
an
innocent
glass
of
wine
anything
can
be
innocent
that
sparkles
to
betray
that
charms
at
first
but
later
will
bite
like
an
adder
and
sting
like
a
serpent
really
belle
if
you
keep
on
at
this
rate
you
will
be
a
monomaniac
on
the
temperance
question
however
i
do
not
think
romaine
will
feel
highly
complimented
to
know
that
you
refused
him
because
you
dreaded
he
might
become
a
drunkard
you
surely
did
not
tell
him
so
yes
i
did
and
i
do
not
think
that
i
would
have
been
a
true
friend
to
him
had
i
not
done
so
oh
belle
i
never
could
have
had
the
courage
to
have
told
him
so
why
not
i
would
have
dreaded
hurting
his
feelings
were
you
not
afraid
of
offending
him
i
certainly
shrank
from
the
pain
which
i
knew
i
must
inflict
but
because
i
valued
his
welfare
more
than
my
own
feelings
i
was
constrained
to
be
faithful
to
him
i
told
him
that
he
was
drifting
where
he
ought
steer
that
instead
of
holding
the
helm
and
rudder
of
his
young
life
he
was
floating
down
the
stream
and
unless
he
stood
firmly
on
the
side
of
temperance
that
i
never
would
clasp
hands
will
him
for
life
but
belle
perhaps
you
have
done
him
more
harm
than
good
may
be
you
could
have
effected
his
reformation
by
consenting
to
marrying
him
jeanette
were
i
the
wife
of
a
drunken
man
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
depth
of
degradation
that
i
would
not
fathom
with
my
love
and
pity
in
trying
to
save
him
i
believe
i
would
cling
to
him
if
even
his
own
mother
shrank
from
him
but
i
never
would
consent
to
marry
any
man
whom
i
knew
to
be
un
steady
in
his
principles
and
a
moderate
drinker
if
his
love
for
me
and
respect
for
himself
were
not
strong
enough
to
reform
him
before
marriage
i
should
despair
of
effecting
it
afterwards
and
with
me
in
such
a
case
discretion
would
be
the
better
part
of
valor
and
so
you
have
given
romaine
a
release
yes
he
is
free
and
i
think
you
have
thrown
away
a
splendid
opportunity
i
do
think
so
the
risk
was
too
perilous
oh
jeanette
i
know
by
mournful
and
bitter
experience
what
it
means
to
dwell
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
home
cursed
by
intemperance
i
know
what
it
is
to
see
that
shadow
deepen
into
the
darkness
of
a
drunkard
grave
and
i
dare
not
run
the
fearful
risk
and
yet
belle
this
has
cost
you
a
great
deal
i
can
see
it
in
the
wanness
of
your
face
in
your
eyes
which
in
spite
of
yourself
are
filled
with
sudden
tears
i
know
from
the
intonations
of
your
voice
that
you
are
suffering
intensely
yes
jeanette
i
confess
it
was
like
tearing
up
the
roots
of
my
life
to
look
at
this
question
fairly
and
squarely
in
the
face
and
to
say
no
but
i
must
learn
to
suffer
and
be
strong
i
am
deeply
pained
it
is
true
but
i
do
not
regret
the
steps
i
have
taken
the
man
who
claims
my
love
and
allegiance
must
be
a
victor
and
not
a
slave
the
reeling
brain
of
a
drunkard
is
not
a
safe
foundation
on
which
to
build
up
a
new
home
well
belle
you
may
be
right
but
i
think
i
would
have
risked
it
i
do
think
because
romaine
drinks
occasionally
that
i
would
have
given
him
up
oh
young
men
will
sow
their
wild
oats
and
as
we
sow
so
must
we
reap
and
as
to
saying
about
young
men
sowing
their
wild
oats
i
think
it
is
full
of
pernicious
license
a
young
man
has
no
more
right
to
sow
his
wild
oats
than
a
young
woman
god
never
made
one
code
of
ethics
for
a
man
and
another
for
a
woman
and
it
is
the
duty
of
all
true
women
to
demand
of
men
the
same
standard
of
morality
that
they
do
of
woman
ah
belle
that
is
very
fine
in
theory
but
you
would
find
it
rather
difficult
if
you
tried
to
reduce
your
theory
to
practice
all
that
may
be
true
but
the
difficulty
of
a
duty
is
not
a
valid
excuse
for
its
non
performance
my
dear
cousin
it
is
not
my
role
to
be
a
reformer
i
take
things
as
i
find
them
and
drift
along
the
tide
of
circumstances
and
is
that
your
highest
ideal
of
life
why
jeanette
such
a
life
is
not
worth
living
whether
it
is
or
not
i
am
living
it
and
i
rather
enjoy
it
your
vexing
problems
of
life
never
disturb
me
i
do
not
think
i
am
called
to
turn
this
great
world
side
up
with
care
and
so
i
float
along
singing
as
i
go
i
be
a
butterfly
born
in
a
bower
kissing
every
rose
that
is
pleasant
and
sweet
i
never
languish
for
wealth
or
for
power
i
never
sigh
to
have
slaves
at
my
feet
such
a
life
would
never
suit
me
life
must
mean
to
me
more
than
ease
luxury
and
indulgence
it
must
mean
aspiration
and
consecration
endeavor
and
achievement
well
belle
should
we
live
twenty
years
longer
i
would
like
to
meet
you
and
see
by
comparing
notes
which
of
us
shall
have
gathered
the
most
sunshine
or
shadow
from
life
yes
jeanette
we
will
meet
in
less
than
twenty
years
but
before
then
your
glad
light
eyes
will
be
dim
with
tears
and
the
easy
path
you
have
striven
to
walk
will
be
thickly
strewn
with
thorn
and
whether
you
deserve
it
or
not
life
will
have
for
you
a
mournful
earnestness
but
notwithstanding
all
your
frivolity
and
flippancy
there
is
fine
gold
in
your
character
which
the
fire
of
affliction
only
will
reveal

how
is
business
very
dull
i
am
losing
terribly
any
prospect
of
times
brightening
i
do
see
my
way
out
clear
but
i
hope
there
will
be
a
change
for
the
better
confidence
has
been
greatly
shaken
men
of
business
have
grown
exceedingly
timid
about
investing
and
there
is
a
general
depression
in
every
department
of
trade
and
business
now
paul
will
you
listen
to
reason
and
common
sense
i
have
a
proposition
to
make
i
am
about
to
embark
in
a
profitable
business
and
i
know
that
it
will
pay
better
than
anything
else
i
could
undertake
in
these
times
men
will
buy
liquor
if
they
have
not
got
money
for
other
things
i
am
going
to
open
a
first
class
saloon
and
on
street
and
if
you
will
join
with
me
we
can
make
a
splendid
thing
of
it
why
just
see
how
well
off
joe
harden
is
since
he
set
up
in
the
business
and
what
airs
he
does
put
on
i
know
when
he
was
not
worth
fifty
dollars
and
kept
a
little
low
groggery
on
the
corner
of
and
streets
but
he
is
out
of
that
now
keeps
a
first
class
and
owns
a
block
of
houses
now
paul
here
is
a
splendid
chance
for
you
business
is
dull
and
now
accept
this
opening
of
course
i
mean
to
keep
a
first
class
saloon
i
do
intend
to
tolerate
loafing
or
disorderly
conduct
or
to
sell
to
drunken
men
in
fact
i
shall
put
up
my
scale
of
prices
so
that
you
need
fear
no
annoyance
from
rough
low
boisterous
men
who
do
know
how
to
behave
themselves
what
say
you
paul
i
say
no
i
would
engage
in
such
a
business
not
if
it
paid
me
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
a
year
i
think
these
first
class
saloons
are
just
as
great
a
curse
to
the
community
as
the
low
groggeries
and
i
look
upon
them
as
the
fountain
heads
of
the
low
groggeries
the
man
who
begins
to
drink
in
the
well
lighted
and
splendidly
furnished
saloon
is
in
danger
of
finishing
in
the
lowest
dens
of
vice
and
shame
as
you
please
said
john
anderson
stiffly
i
thought
that
as
business
is
dull
that
i
would
show
you
a
chance
that
would
yield
you
a
handsome
profit
but
if
you
refuse
there
is
no
harm
done
i
know
young
men
who
would
jump
at
the
chance
you
may
think
it
strange
that
knowing
paul
clifford
as
john
anderson
did
that
he
should
propose
to
him
an
interest
in
a
drinking
saloon
but
john
anderson
was
a
man
who
was
almost
destitute
of
faith
in
human
goodness
his
motto
was
that
every
man
has
his
price
and
as
business
was
fairly
dull
and
paul
was
somewhat
cramped
for
want
of
capital
he
thought
a
good
business
investment
would
be
the
price
for
paul
clifford
conscientious
scruples
anderson
said
paul
looking
him
calmly
in
the
face
you
may
call
me
visionary
and
impracticable
but
i
am
determined
however
poor
i
may
be
never
to
engage
in
any
business
on
which
i
can
not
ask
god
blessing
and
john
i
am
sorry
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
you
have
concluded
to
give
up
your
grocery
and
keep
a
saloon
you
can
not
keep
that
saloon
without
sending
a
flood
of
demoralizing
influence
over
the
community
your
profit
will
be
the
loss
of
others
young
men
will
form
in
that
saloon
habits
which
will
curse
and
overshadow
all
their
lives
husbands
and
fathers
will
waste
their
time
and
money
and
confirm
themselves
in
habits
which
will
bring
misery
crime
and
degradation
and
the
fearful
outcome
of
your
business
will
be
broken
hearted
wives
neglected
children
outcast
men
blighted
characters
and
worse
than
wasted
lives
no
not
for
the
wealth
of
the
indies
would
i
engage
in
such
a
ruinous
business
and
i
am
thankful
today
that
i
had
a
dear
sainted
mother
who
taught
me
that
it
was
better
to
have
my
hands
clear
than
to
have
them
full
how
often
would
she
lay
her
dear
hands
upon
my
head
and
clasp
my
hands
in
hers
and
say
i
want
you
to
live
so
that
you
can
always
feel
that
there
is
no
eye
before
whose
glance
you
will
shrink
no
voice
from
whose
tones
your
heart
will
quail
because
your
hands
are
not
clean
or
your
record
not
pure
and
i
feel
glad
that
the
precepts
and
example
of
that
dear
mother
have
given
tone
and
coloring
to
my
life
and
though
she
has
been
in
her
grave
for
many
years
her
memory
and
her
words
are
still
to
me
an
ever
present
inspiration
yes
paul
i
remember
your
mother
i
wish
oh
well
there
is
no
use
wishing
but
if
all
christians
were
like
her
i
would
have
more
faith
in
their
religion
but
john
the
failure
of
others
is
no
excuse
for
our
own
derelictions
well
i
suppose
not
it
is
said
the
way
jerusalem
was
kept
clean
every
man
swept
before
his
own
door
and
so
you
will
not
engage
in
the
business
no
john
no
money
i
would
earn
would
be
the
least
inducement
how
foolish
said
john
anderson
to
himself
as
they
parted
there
is
a
young
man
who
might
succeed
splendidly
if
he
would
only
give
up
some
of
his
old
fashioned
notions
and
launch
out
into
life
as
if
he
had
some
common
sense
if
business
remains
as
it
is
i
think
he
will
find
out
before
long
that
he
has
got
to
shut
his
eyes
and
swallow
down
a
great
many
things
he
do
like
after
the
refusal
of
paul
clifford
john
soon
found
a
young
man
of
facile
conscience
who
was
willing
to
join
with
him
in
a
conspiracy
of
sin
against
the
peace
happiness
and
welfare
of
the
community
and
he
spared
neither
pains
nor
expense
to
make
his
saloon
attractive
to
what
he
called
the
young
bloods
of
the
city
and
by
these
he
meant
young
men
whose
parents
were
wealthy
and
whose
sons
had
more
leisure
and
spending
money
than
was
good
for
them
he
succeeded
in
fitting
up
a
magnificent
palace
of
sin
night
after
night
till
morning
flashed
the
orient
eager
and
anxious
men
sat
over
the
gaming
table
watching
the
turn
of
a
card
or
the
throw
of
a
dice
sparkling
champaign
or
wine
were
served
in
beautiful
and
costly
glasses
rich
divans
and
easy
chairs
invited
weary
men
to
seek
repose
from
unnatural
excitement
occasionally
women
entered
that
saloon
but
they
were
women
not
as
god
had
made
them
but
as
sin
had
debased
them
women
whose
costly
jewels
and
magnificent
robes
were
the
livery
of
sin
the
outside
garnishing
of
moral
death
the
flush
upon
whose
cheek
was
not
the
flush
of
happiness
and
the
light
in
their
eyes
was
not
the
sparkle
of
innocent
joy
women
whose
laughter
was
sadder
than
their
tears
and
who
were
dead
while
they
lived
in
that
house
were
wine
and
mirth
and
revelry
but
the
dead
were
there
men
dead
to
virtue
true
honor
and
rectitude
who
walked
the
streets
as
other
men
laughed
chatted
bought
sold
exchanged
and
bartered
but
whose
souls
were
encased
in
living
tombs
bodies
that
were
dead
to
righteousness
but
alive
to
sin
like
a
spider
weaving
its
meshes
around
the
unwary
fly
john
anderson
wove
his
network
of
sin
around
the
young
men
that
entered
his
saloon
before
they
entered
there
it
was
pleasant
to
see
the
supple
vigor
and
radiant
health
that
were
manifested
in
the
poise
of
their
bodies
the
lightness
of
their
eyes
the
freshness
of
their
lips
and
the
bloom
upon
their
cheeks
but
oh
it
was
so
sad
to
see
how
soon
the
manly
gait
would
change
to
the
drunkard
stagger
to
see
eyes
once
bright
with
intelligence
growing
vacant
and
confused
and
giving
place
to
the
drunkard
leer
in
many
cases
lassitude
supplanted
vigor
and
sickness
overmastered
health
but
the
saddest
thing
was
the
fearful
power
that
appetite
had
gained
over
its
victims
and
though
nature
lifted
her
signals
of
distress
and
sent
her
warnings
through
weakened
nerves
and
disturbed
functions
and
although
they
were
wasting
money
time
talents
and
health
ruining
their
characters
and
alienating
their
friends
and
bringing
untold
agony
to
hearts
that
loved
them
and
yearned
over
their
defections
yet
the
fascination
grew
stronger
and
ever
and
anon
the
grave
opened
at
their
feet
and
disguise
it
as
loving
friends
might
the
seeds
of
death
had
been
nourished
by
the
fiery
waters
of

for
a
few
days
the
most
engrossing
topic
in
was
what
shall
i
wear
and
what
will
you
wear
there
was
an
amount
of
shopping
to
be
done
and
dressmakers
to
be
consulted
and
employed
before
the
great
event
of
the
season
came
off
at
length
the
important
evening
arrived
and
in
the
home
of
glossop
a
wealthy
and
retired
whiskey
dealer
there
was
a
brilliant
array
of
wealth
and
fashion
could
all
the
misery
his
liquor
had
caused
been
turned
into
blood
there
would
have
been
enough
to
have
oozed
in
great
drops
from
every
marble
ornament
or
beautiful
piece
of
frescoe
that
adorned
his
home
for
that
home
with
its
beautiful
surroundings
and
costly
furniture
was
the
price
of
blood
but
the
glamor
of
his
wealth
was
in
the
eyes
of
his
guests
and
they
came
to
be
amused
and
entertained
and
not
to
moralize
on
his
wealth
the
wine
flowed
out
in
unstinted
measures
and
some
of
the
women
so
forgot
themselves
as
to
attempt
to
rival
the
men
in
drinking
the
barrier
being
thrown
down
charles
drank
freely
till
his
tones
began
to
thicken
and
his
eye
to
grow
muddled
and
he
sat
down
near
jeanette
and
tried
to
converse
but
he
was
too
much
under
the
influence
of
liquor
to
hold
a
sensible
and
coherent
conversation
oh
charley
you
naughty
boy
that
wine
has
got
into

you
do
know

you
are
talking

you
my

charles
romaine
why
charlie
you
are

i
believe
we
have
all
got
too
much
wine
aboard
but
we
are
not
as
bad
as
the
girls
of
for
they
succeeded
in
out
drinking
the
men
i
heard
the
men
drank
eight
bottles
of
wine
and
that
they
drank
sixteen
alas
for
these
young
people
they
were
sporting
upon
the

its

edge
was
concealed

they
were

morning
belle
said
jeanette
roland
to
her
cousin
belle
as
she
entered
her
cousin
the
morning
after
the
party
and
found
jeanette
lounging
languidly
upon
the
sofa
good
morning
it
is
a
lovely
day
why
are
you
not
out
enjoying
the
fresh
air
ca
you
put
on
your
things
and
go
shopping
with
me
i
think
you
have
excellent
taste
and
i
often
want
to
consult
it
well
after
all
then
i
am
of
some
account
in
your
eyes
of
course
you
are
who
said
you
were
not
oh
nobody
only
i
had
an
idea
that
you
thought
that
i
was
as
useless
as
a
canary
bird
i
do
think
that
a
canary
bird
is
at
all
a
useless
thing
it
charms
our
ears
with
its
song
and
pleases
our
eye
with
its
beauty
and
i
am
a
firm
believer
in
the
utility
of
beauty
but
can
you
or
rather
will
you
not
go
with
me
oh
belle
i
would
but
i
am
as
sleepy
as
a
cat
what
the
matter
i
was
up
so
late
last
night
at
glossop
party
but
really
it
was
a
splendid
affair
everything
was
in
the
richest
profusion
and
their
house
is
magnificently
furnished
oh
belle
i
wish
you
could
have
been
there
i
do
there
are
two
classes
of
people
with
whom
i
never
wish
to
associate
or
number
as
my
especial
friends
and
they
are
rum
sellers
and
slave
holders
oh
well
glossop
is
not
in
the
business
now
and
what
is
the
use
of
talking
about
the
past
do
be
always
remembering
a
man
sins
against
him
would
you
say
the
same
of
a
successful
pirate
who
could
fare
sumptuously
from
the
effects
of
his
piracy
no
i
would
not
but
belle
the
cases
is
not
at
all
parallel
not
entirely
one
commits
his
crime
against
society
within
the
pale
of
the
law
the
other
commits
his
outside
they
are
both
criminals
against
the
welfare
of
humanity
one
murders
the
body
and
the
other
stabs
the
soul
if
i
knew
that
glossop
was
sorry
for
having
been
a
liquor
dealer
and
was
bringing
forth
fruits
meet
for
repentance
i
would
be
among
the
first
to
hail
his
reformation
with
heartfelt
satisfaction
but
when
i
hear
that
while
he
no
longer
sells
liquor
that
he
constantly
offers
it
to
his
guests
i
feel
that
he
should
rather
sit
down
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
than
fireside
at
sumptuous
feasts
obtained
by
liquor
selling
when
crime
is
sanctioned
by
law
and
upheld
by
custom
and
fashion
it
assumes
its
most
dangerous
phase
and
there
is
often
a
fearful
fascination
in
the
sin
that
is
environed
by
success
oh
belle
do
stop
i
really
think
that
you
will
go
crazy
on
the
subject
of
temperance
i
think
you
must
have
written
these
lines
that
i
have
picked
up
somewhere
let
me
see
what
they
are
tell
me
not
that
i
hate
the
bowl
hate
is
a
feeble
word
no
jeanette
i
did
not
write
them
but
i
have
felt
all
the
writer
has
so
nervously
expressed
in
my
own
home
and
over
my
poor
father
grave
i
learned
to
hate
liquor
in
any
form
with
all
the
intensity
of
my
nature
well
it
was
a
good
thing
you
were
not
at
glossop
last
night
for
some
of
our
heads
were
rather
dizzy
and
i
know
that
romaine
was
out
of
gear
now
belle
do
look
so
shocked
and
pained
i
am
sorry
i
told
you
yes
i
am
very
sorry
i
had
great
hopes
that
romaine
had
entirely
given
up
drinking
and
i
was
greatly
pained
when
i
saw
him
take
a
glass
of
wine
at
your
solicitation
jeanette
i
think
romaine
feels
a
newly
awakened
interest
in
you
and
i
know
that
you
possess
great
influence
over
him
i
saw
it
that
night
when
he
hesitated
when
you
first
asked
him
to
drink
and
i
was
so
sorry
to
see
that
influence
oh
jeanette
instead
of
being
his
temptress
try
and
be
the
angel
that
keeps
his
steps
if
romaine
ever
becomes
a
drunkard
and
goes
down
to
a
drunkard
grave
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
a
large
measure
of
the
guilt
will
cling
to
your
shirts
oh
belle
do
stop
or
you
will
give
me
the
horrors
pa
takes
wine
every
day
at
his
dinner
and
i
do
see
that
he
is
any
worse
off
for
it
if
charles
romaine
ca
govern
himself
i
ca
see
how
i
am
to
blame
for
it
i
think
you
are
to
blame
for
this
jeanette
and
pardon
me
if
i
speak
plainly
when
charles
romaine
was
trying
to
abstain
you
tempted
him
to
break
his
resolution
and
he
drank
to
please
you
i
would
have
done
so
for
my
right
hand
they
say
old
coals
are
easily
kindled
and
i
shall
be
somewhat
chary
about
receiving
attention
from
him
if
you
feel
so
deeply
upon
the
subject
jeanette
you
entirely
misapprehend
me
because
i
have
ceased
to
regard
romaine
as
a
lover
does
not
hinder
me
from
feeling
for
him
as
a
friend
and
because
i
am
his
friend
and
yours
also
i
take
the
liberty
to
remonstrate
against
your
offering
him
wine
at
your
entertainments
well
belle
i
ca
see
the
harm
in
it
i
do
believe
there
was
another
soul
who
refused
except
you
and
freeman
and
you
are
so
straightlaced
and
he
is
rather
green
just
fresh
from
the
country
it
wo
take
him
long
to
get
citified
citified
or
countrified
i
could
help
admiring
his
strength
of
principle
which
stood
firm
in
the
midst
of
temptation
and
would
not
yield
to
the
blandishments
of
the
hour
and
so
you
will
not
go
out
with
me
this
morning
oh
no
belle
i
am
too
tired
wo
you
excuse
me
certainly
but
i
must
go
good
morning
what
a
strange
creature
my
cousin
belle
is
said
jeanette
to
herself
as
miss
gordon
left
the
room
she
will
never
be
like
any
one
else
i
do
think
she
will
ever
get
over
my
offering
romaine
that
glass
of
wine
i
wish
she
had
seen
it
but
i
try
and
forget
her
and
go
to
sleep
but
jeanette
was
not
destined
to
have
the
whole
morning
for
an
unbroken
sleep
soon
after
bell
departure
the
bell
rang
and
charles
romaine
was
announced
and
weary
as
jeanette
was
she
was
too
much
interested
in
his
society
to
refuse
him
and
arraying
herself
in
a
very
tasteful
and
becoming
manner
she
went
down
to
receive
him
in
the
parlor
chapter
vii
very
pleasant
was
the
reception
jeanette
roland
gave
romaine
there
was
no
reproof
upon
her
lips
nor
implied
censure
in
her
manner
true
he
had
been
disguised
by
liquor
or
to
use
a
softer
phrase
had
taken
too
much
wine
but
others
had
done
the
same
and
treated
it
as
a
merry
escapade
and
why
should
she
be
so
particular
belle
gordon
would
have
acted
very
differently
but
then
she
was
not
belle
and
in
this
instance
she
did
not
wish
to
imitate
her
belle
was
so
odd
and
had
become
very
unpopular
and
besides
she
wished
to
be
very
very
pleasant
to
romaine
he
was
handsome
agreeable
and
wealthy
and
she
found
it
more
congenial
to
her
taste
to
clasp
hands
with
him
and
float
down
stream
together
than
help
him
breast
the
current
of
his
wrong
tendencies
and
stand
firmly
on
the
rock
of
principle
you
are
looking
very
sweet
but
rather
pensive
this
morning
said
romaine
noticing
a
shadow
on
the
bright
and
beautiful
face
of
jeanette
whose
color
had
deepened
by
the
plain
remarks
of
her
cousin
belle
what
is
the
matter
oh
nothing
much
only
my
cousin
belle
has
been
here
this
morning
and
she
has
been
putting
me
on
the
stool
of
repentance
why
what
have
you
been
doing
that
was
naughty
oh
she
was
perfectly
when
i
told
her
about
the
wine
we
drank
and
glossop
party
i
wish
i
had
not
said
a
word
to
her
about
it
what
did
she
say
oh
she
thought
it
was
awful
the
way
we
were
going
on
she
made
me
feel
that
i
died
something
dreadful
when
i
offered
you
a
glass
of
wine
at
ma
silver
wedding
i
do
believe
belle
ever
sees
a
glass
of
wine
without
thinking
of
murder
suicide
and
a
drunkard
grave
but
we
are
not
afraid
of
those
dreadful
things
are
we
jeanette
of
course
not
but
somehow
belle
always
makes
me
feel
uncomfortable
when
she
begins
to
talk
on
temperance
she
says
she
is
terribly
in
earnest
and
i
think
she
is
miss
gordon
and
i
were
great
friends
once
said
charles
romaine
as
a
shadow
flitted
over
his
face
and
a
slight
sigh
escaped
his
lips
were
you
why
did
you
remain
so
because
she
was
too
good
for
me
that
is
a
very
sorry
reason
but
it
is
true
i
think
miss
gordon
is
an
excellent
young
lady
but
she
and
i
would
agree
on
the
temperance
question
the
man
who
marries
her
has
got
to
toe
the
mark
she
ought
to
be
a
minister
wife
i
expect
she
will
be
an
old
maid
i
do
know
but
if
i
were
to
marry
her
i
should
prepare
myself
to
go
to
church
every
sunday
morning
and
to
stay
home
in
the
afternoon
and
repeat
my
catechism
i
would
like
to
see
you
under
her
discipline
it
would
come
hard
on
a
fellow
but
i
might
go
farther
and
fare
worse
and
so
you
and
belle
were
great
friends
once
yes
but
as
we
could
not
agree
on
the
total
abstinence
question
we
parted
company
how
so
did
you
part
as
lovers
part
she
with
a
wronged
and
broken
heart
and
you
rejoicing
you
were
free
glad
to
regain
you
liberty
not
at
all
she
gave
me
the
mitten
and
i
had
to
take
it
were
you
very
sorry
yes
till
i
met
you
oh
romaine
said
jeanette
blushing
and
dropping
her
eyes
why
not
i
think
i
have
found
in
your
society
an
ample
compensation
for
the
loss
of
miss
gordon
but
i
think
belle
is
better
than
i
am
i
sometimes
wish
i
was
half
so
good
you
are
good
enough
for
me
belle
is
very
good
but
somehow
her
goodness
makes
a
fellow
uncomfortable
she
is
what
i
call
distressingly
good
one
does
want
to
be
treated
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
menagerie
and
to
be
every
now
and
then
stirred
up
with
a
long
stick
what
a
comparison
well
it
is
a
fact
when
a
fellow
been
busy
all
day
pouring
over
coke
and
blackstone
or
casting
up
wearisome
rows
of
figures
and
seeks
a
young
lady
society
in
the
evening
he
wants
to
enjoy
himself
to
bathe
in
the
sunshine
of
her
smiles
and
not
to
be
lectured
about
his
shortcomings
i
tell
you
jeanette
it
comes
hard
on
a
fellow
you
want
some
one
to
smooth
the
wrinkles
out
of
the
brow
of
care
and
not
to
add
fresh
ones
yes
and
i
hope
it
will
be
my
fortune
to
have
a
fair
soft
hand
like
his
said
romaine
slightly
pressing
jeanette
hand
to
perform
the
welcome
and
agreeable
task
belle
hand
would
be
firmer
than
mine
for
the
talk
it
is
not
the
strong
hand
but
the
tender
hand
i
want
in
a
woman
but
belle
is
very
kind
she
did
it
all
for
your
own
good
of
course
she
did
my
father
used
to
say
so
when
i
was
a
boy
and
he
corrected
me
but
it
did
make
me
enjoy
the
correction
it
is
said
our
best
friends
are
those
who
show
us
our
faults
and
teach
us
how
to
correct
them
my
best
friend
is
a
dear
sweet
girl
who
sits
by
my
side
who
always
welcomes
me
with
a
smile
and
beguiles
me
so
with
her
conversation
that
i
take
no
note
of
the
hours
until
the
striking
of
the
clock
warns
me
it
is
time
to
leave
and
i
should
ask
no
higher
happiness
than
to
be
permitted
to
pass
all
the
remaining
hours
of
my
life
at
her
side
can
i
dare
to
hope
for
such
a
happy
fortune
a
bright
flush
overspread
the
cheek
of
jeanette
roland
there
was
a
sparkle
of
joy
in
her
eyes
as
she
seemed
intently
examining
the
flowers
on
her
mother
carpet
and
she
gently
referred
him
to
papa
for
an
answer
in
due
time
roland
was
interviewed
his
consent
obtained
and
jeanette
roland
and
charles
romaine
were
affianced
lovers
girls
have
you
heard
the
news
said
miss
tabitha
jones
a
pleasant
and
wealthy
spinster
to
a
number
of
young
girls
who
were
seated
at
her
tea
table
no
what
is
it
i
hear
romaine
is
to
be
married
next
spring
to
whom
jeanette
roland
well
i
do
declare
i
thought
he
was
engaged
to
belle
gordon
i
thought
so
too
but
it
is
said
that
she
refused
him
but
i
believe
it
i
do
believe
that
she
had
a
chance
well
i
do
why
did
she
refuse
him
because
he
would
occasionally
take
too
much
wine
but
he
is
not
a
drunkard
but
she
dreads
that
he
will
be
well
i
think
it
is
perfectly
ridiculous
i
gave
belle
credit
for
more
common
sense
i
think
he
was
one
of
the
most
eligible
gentlemen
in
our
set
wealthy
handsome
and
agreeable
what
could
have
possessed
belle
i
think
he
is
perfectly
splendid
yes
said
another
girl
i
think
belle
stood
very
much
in
her
own
light
she
is
not
rich
and
if
she
would
marry
him
she
could
have
everything
heart
could
wish
what
a
silly
girl
you
would
catch
me
throwing
away
such
a
chance
i
think
said
miss
tabitha
that
instead
of
miss
gordon
being
a
silly
girl
that
she
has
acted
both
sensibly
and
honorably
in
refusing
to
marry
a
man
she
could
not
love
no
woman
should
give
her
hand
where
she
can
not
yield
her
heart
but
miss
tabitha
the
strangest
thing
to
me
is
that
i
really
believe
that
belle
gordon
cares
more
for
romaine
than
she
does
for
any
one
else
her
face
was
a
perfect
study
that
night
at
roland
party
how
so
they
say
that
after
miss
gordon
requested
romaine
that
for
a
while
he
scrupulously
abstained
from
taking
even
a
glass
of
wine
at
several
entertainments
he
adhered
to
this
purpose
but
on
the
evening
of
roland
silver
wedding
jeanette
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
take
a
glass
in
honor
of
the
occasion
i
watched
belle
face
and
it
was
a
perfect
study
every
nerve
seemed
quivering
with
intense
anxiety
once
i
think
she
reached
out
her
hand
unconsciously
as
if
to
snatch
away
the
glass
and
when
at
last
he
yielded
i
saw
the
light
fade
from
her
eyes
a
deadly
pallor
overspread
her
cheek
and
i
thought
at
one
time
she
was
about
to
faint
but
she
did
not
and
only
laid
her
head
upon
her
side
as
if
to
allay
a
sudden
spasm
of
agony
chapter
viii
paul
clifford
sat
at
his
ledger
with
a
perplexed
and
anxious
look
it
was
near
two
and
his
note
was
in
bank
if
he
could
not
raise
five
hundred
dollars
by
three
that
note
would
be
protested
money
was
exceedingly
hard
to
raise
and
he
was
about
despairing
once
he
thought
of
applying
to
john
anderson
but
he
said
to
himself
no
i
will
not
touch
his
money
for
it
is
the
price
of
blood
for
he
did
not
wish
to
owe
gratitude
where
he
did
not
feel
respect
it
was
now
five
minutes
past
two
and
in
less
than
an
hour
his
note
would
be
protested
unless
relief
came
from
some
unexpected
quarter
is
clifford
in
said
a
full
manly
voice
paul
suddenly
roused
from
his
painful
reflections
answered
yes
come
in
good
morning
sir
what
can
i
do
for
you
this
morning
i
have
come
to
see
you
on
business
i
am
at
your
service
said
paul
do
you
remember
said
the
young
man
of
having
aided
an
unfortunate
friend
more
than
a
dozen
years
since
by
lending
him
five
hundred
dollars
yes
i
remember
he
was
an
old
friend
of
mine
a
of
my
father
charles
smith
well
i
am
his
son
and
i
have
come
to
liquidate
my
father
debt
here
is
the
money
with
interest
for
twelve
years
paul
heart
gave
a
sudden
bound
of
joy
strong
man
as
he
was
a
mist
gathered
in
his
eyes
as
he
reached
out
his
hand
to
receive
the
thrice
welcome
sum
he
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
just
fifteen
minutes
to
three
will
you
walk
with
me
to
the
bank
or
wait
till
i
return
i
will
wait
said
james
smith
taking
up
the
morning
paper
you
are
just
in
time
clifford
said
the
banker
smiling
and
bowing
as
paul
entered
i
was
afraid
your
note
would
be
protested
but
it
is
all
right
yes
said
paul
the
money
market
is
very
tight
but
i
think
i
shall
weather
the
storm
i
hope
so
you
may
have
to
struggle
hard
for
awhile
to
keep
your
head
above
the
water
but
you
must
take
it
for
your
motto
that
there
is
no
such
word
as
thank
you
good
morning
well
smith
said
paul
when
he
returned
your
father
and
mine
were
boys
together
he
was
several
years
younger
than
my
father
and
a
great
favorite
in
our
family
among
the
young
folks
about
twelve
years
since
when
i
had
just
commenced
business
i
lent
him
five
hundred
dollars
and
when
his
business
troubles
became
complicated
i
refused
to
foreclose
a
mortgage
which
i
had
on
his
home
an
acquaintance
of
mine
sneered
at
my
lack
of
business
keenness
and
predicted
that
my
money
would
be
totally
lost
when
i
told
him
perhaps
it
was
the
best
investment
i
ever
made
he
smiled
incredulously
and
said
i
would
rather
see
it
than
hear
of
it
but
i
will
say
that
in
all
my
business
career
i
never
received
any
money
that
came
so
opportune
as
this
it
reminds
me
of
the
stories
that
i
have
read
in
fairy
books
people
so
often
fail
in
paying
their
own
debts
it
seems
almost
a
mystery
to
me
that
you
should
pay
a
debt
contracted
by
your
father
when
you
were
but
a
boy
the
clue
to
this
mystery
has
been
the
blessed
influence
of
my
sainted
mother
and
a
flush
of
satisfaction
mantled
his
cheek
as
he
referred
to
her
after
my
father
death
my
mother
was
very
poor
when
she
looked
into
the
drawer
there
were
only
sixty
cents
in
money
of
course
he
had
some
personal
property
but
it
was
not
immediately
available
like
money
but
through
the
help
of
kind
friends
she
was
enabled
to
give
him
a
respectable
funeral
like
many
other
women
in
her
condition
of
life
she
had
been
brought
up
in
entire
ignorance
of
managing
any
other
business
than
that
which
belonged
to
her
household
for
years
she
had
been
shielded
in
the
warm
clasp
of
loving
arms
but
now
she
had
to
bare
her
breast
to
the
storm
and
be
father
and
mother
both
to
her
little
ones
my
father
as
you
know
died
in
debt
and
he
was
hardly
in
his
grave
when
his
creditors
were
upon
her
track
i
have
often
heard
her
speak
in
the
most
grateful
manner
of
your
forbearance
and
kindness
to
her
in
her
hour
of
trouble
my
mother
went
to
see
my
father
principal
creditor
and
asked
him
only
to
give
her
a
little
time
to
straighten
out
the
tangled
threads
of
her
business
but
he
was
inexorable
and
said
that
he
had
waited
and
lost
by
it
very
soon
he
had
an
administrator
appointed
by
the
court
who
in
about
two
months
took
the
business
in
his
hands
and
my
mother
was
left
to
struggle
along
with
her
little
ones
and
face
an
uncertain
future
these
were
dark
days
but
we
managed
to
live
through
them
i
have
often
heard
her
say
that
she
lived
by
faith
and
not
sight
that
poverty
had
its
compensations
that
there
was
something
very
sweet
in
a
life
of
simple
trust
to
her
god
was
not
some
far
off
and
unapproachable
force
in
the
universe
the
unconscious
creator
of
all
consciousness
the
unperceiving
author
of
all
perception
but
a
friend
and
a
father
coming
near
to
her
in
sorrows
taking
cognizance
of
her
grief
and
gently
smoothing
her
path
in
life
but
it
was
not
only
by
precept
that
she
taught
us
her
life
was
a
living
epistle
one
morning
as
the
winter
was
advancing
i
heard
her
say
she
hoped
she
would
be
able
to
get
a
nice
woolen
shawl
as
hers
was
getting
worse
for
wear
shortly
after
i
went
out
into
the
street
and
found
a
roll
of
money
lying
at
my
feet
oh
i
remember
it
as
well
as
if
it
had
just
occurred
how
my
heart
bounded
with
joy
i
said
to
myself
money
enough
to
buy
mother
a
shawl
and
bonnet
oh
i
am
so
glad
and
hurrying
home
i
laid
it
in
her
lap
and
said
with
boyish
glee
for
your
new
shawl
look
what
i
found
in
the
street
what
is
it
my
son
she
said
why
here
is
money
enough
to
buy
you
a
new
shawl
and
bonnet
too
it
seems
as
if
i
see
her
now
as
she
looked
when
she
laid
it
aside
and
said
but
james
it
is
not
ours
not
ours
mother
why
i
found
it
in
the
street
still
it
is
not
ours
why
mother
you
going
to
keep
it
no
my
son
i
shall
go
down
to
the
office
and
advertise
it
but
mother
why
not
wait
till
it
is
advertised
and
what
then
if
there
is
no
owner
for
it
then
we
can
keep
it
james
she
said
calmly
and
sadly
i
am
very
sorry
to
see
you
so
ready
to
use
what
is
not
your
own
i
should
not
feel
that
i
was
dealing
justly
if
i
kept
this
money
without
endeavoring
to
find
the
owner
i
confess
that
i
was
rather
chopfallen
at
her
decision
but
in
a
few
days
after
advertising
we
found
the
rightful
owner
she
was
a
very
poor
woman
who
had
saved
by
dint
of
hard
labor
the
sum
of
twenty
dollars
and
was
on
her
way
to
pay
the
doctor
who
had
attended
her
during
a
spell
of
rheumatic
fever
when
she
lost
the
money
and
had
not
one
dollar
left
to
pay
for
advertising
and
being
disheartened
she
had
given
up
all
hope
of
finding
it
when
she
happened
to
see
it
advertised
in
the
paper
she
was
very
grateful
to
my
mother
for
restoring
the
money
and
offered
her
some
compensation
but
she
refused
to
take
it
saying
she
had
only
done
her
duty
and
would
have
been
ashamed
of
herself
had
she
not
done
so
her
conduct
on
this
occasion
made
an
impression
on
my
mind
that
has
never
been
erased
when
i
grew
older
she
explained
to
me
about
my
affairs
and
uncancelled
debts
and
i
resolved
that
i
would
liquidate
every
just
claim
against
him
and
take
from
his
memory
even
the
shadow
of
a
reproach
to
this
end
i
have
labored
late
and
early
i
have
paid
the
last
claim
against
him
and
i
am
a
free
man
but
how
came
you
to
find
me
and
pay
me
i
was
purchasing
in
jones
brother
store
when
you
came
in
to
borrow
money
and
i
heard
jones
tell
his
younger
brother
that
he
was
so
sorry
that
he
could
not
help
you
and
feared
that
you
would
be
ruined
who
is
he
said
i
for
out
west
i
had
lost
track
of
you
he
is
paul
clifford
a
friend
of
your
father
can
you
help
him
he
is
perfectly
reliable
we
would
trust
him
with
ten
thousand
dollars
if
we
had
it
can
you
do
anything
for
him
we
will
go
his
security
he
is
a
fine
fellow
and
we
hate
to
see
him
go
under
yes
said
i
he
was
one
of
my
father
creditors
and
i
have
often
heard
my
mother
speak
of
his
generosity
to
her
little
ones
and
i
am
glad
that
i
have
the
privilege
of
helping
him
i
immediately
went
to
the
bank
had
a
note
cashed
and
i
am
very
glad
if
i
have
been
of
any
special
service
to
you
you
certainly
have
been
and
i
feel
that
a
heavy
load
had
been
lifted
from
my
heart
years
ago
paul
clifford
sowed
the
seeds
of
kindness
and
they
were
yielding
him
a
harvest
of
satisfaction
chapter
ix
belle
gordon
belle
gordon
was
a
christian
she
had
learned
or
tried
to
realize
what
is
meant
by
the
apostle
paul
when
he
said
ye
are
bought
with
a
price
to
her
those
words
meant
the
obligation
she
was
under
to
her
heavenly
father
for
the
goodness
and
mercy
that
had
surrounded
her
life
for
the
patience
that
had
borne
with
her
errors
and
sins
and
above
all
for
the
gift
of
his
dear
son
the
ever
blessed
christ
faith
to
her
was
not
a
rich
traditional
inheritance
a
set
of
formulated
opinions
received
without
investigation
and
adopted
without
reflection
she
could
not
believe
because
others
did
and
however
plausible
or
popular
a
thing
might
be
she
was
too
conscientious
to
say
she
believed
it
if
she
did
not
and
when
she
became
serious
on
the
subject
of
religion
it
was
like
entering
into
a
wilderness
of
doubt
and
distress
she
had
been
taught
to
look
upon
god
more
as
the
great
and
dreadful
god
than
as
the
tender
loving
father
of
his
human
children
and
so
strong
was
the
power
of
association
that
she
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
god
is
good
and
yet
until
she
could
believe
this
there
seemed
to
be
no
resting
place
for
her
soul
but
in
course
of
time
the
shadows
were
lifted
from
her
life
faith
took
the
place
of
doubting
and
in
the
precious
promises
of
the
bible
she
felt
that
her
soul
had
found
a
safe
and
sure
anchorage
if
others
believed
because
they
had
never
doubted
she
believed
because
she
had
doubted
and
her
doubts
had
been
dispelled
by
the
rays
of
heaven
and
believing
she
had
entered
into
rest
feeling
that
she
was
bought
with
a
price
she
realized
that
she
was
not
her
own
but
the
captive
of
divine
love
and
that
her
talents
were
not
given
her
to
hide
beneath
a
bushel
or
to
use
for
merely
selfish
enjoyments
that
her
time
was
not
her
own
to
be
frittered
away
by
the
demands
of
fashion
or
to
be
spent
in
unavailing
regrets
every
reform
which
had
for
its
object
the
lessening
of
human
misery
or
the
increase
of
human
happiness
found
in
her
an
earnest
ally
on
the
subject
of
temperance
she
was
terribly
in
earnest
every
fiber
of
her
heart
responded
to
its
onward
movement
there
was
no
hut
or
den
where
human
beings
congregated
that
she
felt
was
too
vile
or
too
repulsive
to
enter
if
by
so
doing
she
could
help
lift
some
fallen
soul
out
of
the
depths
of
sin
and
degradation
while
some
doubted
the
soundness
of
her
religious
opinions
none
doubted
the
orthodoxy
of
her
life
little
children
in
darkened
homes
smiled
as
the
sunlight
of
her
presence
came
over
their
paths
reformed
men
looked
upon
her
as
a
loving
counsellor
and
faithful
friend
and
sister
women
wretched
and
sorrowful
dragged
down
from
love
and
light
by
the
intemperance
of
their
husbands
brought
to
her
their
heavy
burdens
and
by
her
sympathy
and
tender
consideration
she
helped
them
bear
them
she
was
not
rich
in
this
world
goods
but
she
was
affluent
in
tenderness
sympathy
and
love
and
out
of
the
fullness
of
her
heart
she
was
a
real
minister
of
mercy
among
the
poor
and
degraded
believing
that
the
inner
life
developed
the
outer
she
considered
the
poor
and
strove
to
awaken
within
them
and
feeling
that
one
of
the
surest
ways
to
render
people
helpless
or
dangerous
is
to
crush
out
their
and
she
thought
it
one
of
the
greatest
privileges
of
her
life
to
be
permitted
to
scatter
flowers
by
the
wayside
of
life
other
women
might
write
beautiful
poems
she
did
more
she
made
her
life
a
thing
of
brightness
and
beauty
do
you
think
she
will
die
said
belle
gordon
bending
tenderly
over
a
pale
and
fainting
woman
whose
face
in
spite
of
its
attenuation
showed
traces
of
great
beauty
not
if
she
is
properly
cared
for
she
has
fainted
from
exhaustion
brought
on
by
overwork
and
want
of
proper
food
tears
gathered
in
the
eyes
of
belle
gordon
as
she
lifted
the
beautiful
head
upon
her
lap
and
chafed
the
pale
hands
to
bring
back
warmth
and
circulation
let
her
be
removed
to
her
home
as
soon
as
possible
said
the
doctor
the
air
is
too
heavy
and
damp
for
her
i
wonder
where
she
lives
said
belle
thoughtfully
scanning
her
face
as
the
features
began
to
show
returning
animation
round
the
corner
said
an
urchin
she
joe
cough
wife
i
seed
her
going
down
the
street
with
a
great
big
bundle
and
mam
said
she
looked
like
she
was
going
to
topple
over
where
is
her
husband
i
do
know
i
he
down
to
jim
green
saloon
what
does
he
do
he
do
do
nothing
but
mam
says
she
works
awful
hard
come
this
way
said
he
with
a
quickness
gathered
by
his
constant
contact
with
street
life
up
two
flights
of
rickety
stairs
they
carried
the
wasted
form
of
mary
gough
and
laid
her
tenderly
upon
a
clean
but
very
poor
bed
in
spite
of
her
extreme
poverty
there
was
an
air
of
neatness
in
the
desolate
room
belle
looked
around
and
found
an
old
tea
pot
in
which
there
were
a
few
leaves
there
were
some
dry
crusts
in
the
cupboard
while
two
little
children
crouched
by
the
embers
in
the
grate
and
cried
for
the
mother
belle
soon
found
a
few
coals
in
an
old
basin
with
which
she
replenished
the
fire
and
covering
up
the
sick
woman
as
carefully
as
she
could
stepped
into
the
nearest
grocery
and
replenished
her
basket
with
some
of
good
the
things
of
life
is
it
not
too
heavy
for
you
r
might
said
paul
clifford
from
whose
grocery
belle
had
bought
her
supplies
can
i
not
send
them
home
for
you
no
i
do
want
them
sent
home
they
are
for
a
poor
woman
and
her
suffering
children
who
live
about
a
square
from
here
in
lear
court
paul
stood
thoughtfully
a
moment
before
handing
her
the
basket
and
said
that
court
has
a
very
bad
reputation
had
i
not
better
accompany
you
i
hope
you
will
not
consider
my
offer
as
an
intrusion
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
safe
for
you
to
venture
there
alone
if
you
think
it
is
not
safe
i
will
accept
of
your
company
but
i
never
thought
of
danger
for
myself
in
the
presence
of
that
fainting
woman
and
her
hungry
children
do
you
know
her
her
name
is
mrs
gough
i
think
i
do
if
it
is
the
person
i
mean
i
remember
her
when
she
was
as
lighthearted
and
happy
a
girl
as
i
ever
saw
but
she
married
against
her
parents
consent
a
worthless
fellow
named
joe
gough
and
in
a
short
time
she
disappeared
from
the
village
and
i
suppose
she
has
come
home
broken
in
health
and
broken
in
spirit
and
i
am
afraid
she
has
come
home
to
die
are
her
parents
still
alive
yes
but
her
father
never
forgave
her
her
mother
i
believe
would
take
her
to
her
heart
as
readily
as
she
ever
did
but
her
husband
has
an
iron
will
and
she
has
got
to
submit
to
him
where
do
they
live
at
no
rouen
but
here
we
are
at
the
door
paul
carried
the
basket
up
stairs
and
sat
down
quietly
while
belle
prepared
some
refreshing
tea
and
toast
for
the
feeble
mother
and
some
bread
and
milk
for
the
hungry
children
what
shall
i
do
said
belle
looking
tenderly
upon
the
wan
face
i
hate
to
leave
her
alone
and
yet
i
confess
i
do
not
prefer
spending
the
night
here
of
course
not
said
paul
looking
thoughtfully
into
the
flickering
fire
of
the
grate
oh
i
have
it
now
i
know
a
very
respectable
woman
who
occasionally
cleans
out
my
store
just
wait
a
few
moments
and
i
think
i
can
find
her
said
paul
clifford
turning
to
the
door
in
a
short
time
he
returned
bringing
with
him
a
pleasant
looking
woman
whose
face
in
spite
of
the
poverty
of
her
dress
had
a
look
of
genuine
refinement
which
comes
not
so
much
from
mingling
with
people
of
culture
as
from
the
culture
of
her
own
moral
and
spiritual
nature
she
had
learned
to
look
up
and
not
to
look
down
to
lend
a
helping
hand
wherever
she
felt
it
was
needed
her
life
was
spent
in
humble
usefulness
she
was
poor
in
this
goods
but
rich
in
faith
and
good
works
no
poor
person
who
asked
her
for
bread
ever
went
away
empty
sometimes
people
would
say
i
give
him
a
mouthful
he
is
not
worthy
and
then
she
would
say
in
the
tenderest
and
sweetest
manner
suppose
our
heavenly
father
only
gave
to
us
because
we
are
worthy
what
would
any
of
us
have
i
know
she
once
said
of
a
miserable
sot
with
whom
she
shared
her
scanty
food
that
he
is
a
wretched
creature
but
i
wanted
to
get
at
his
heart
and
the
best
way
to
it
was
through
his
stomach
i
never
like
to
preach
religion
to
hungry
people
there
is
something
very
beautiful
about
the
charity
of
the
poor
they
give
not
as
the
rich
of
their
abundance
but
of
their
limited
earnings
gifts
which
when
given
in
a
right
spirit
bring
a
blessing
with
them
chapter
x
mary
gough
i
think
said
paul
clifford
to
miss
gordon
that
i
have
found
just
the
person
that
will
suit
you
and
if
you
accept
i
will
be
pleased
to
see
you
safe
home
belle
thanked
the
young
grocer
and
gratefully
accepted
his
company
belle
returned
the
next
day
to
see
her
protege
and
found
her
getting
along
comfortably
although
she
could
not
help
seeing
it
was
sorrow
more
than
disease
that
was
sapping
her
life
and
drying
up
the
feeble
streams
of
existence
how
do
you
feel
this
morning
said
belle
laying
her
hand
tenderly
upon
her
forehead
better
much
better
she
replied
with
an
attempt
at
cheerfulness
in
her
voice
i
am
so
glad
that
mother
graham
is
here
it
is
like
letting
the
sunshine
into
these
gloomy
rooms
to
have
her
around
it
all
seems
like
a
dream
to
me
i
remember
carrying
a
large
bundle
of
work
to
the
store
that
my
employer
spoke
harshly
to
me
and
talked
of
cutting
down
my
wages
i
also
remember
turning
into
the
street
my
eyes
almost
blinded
with
tears
and
that
i
felt
a
dizziness
in
my
head
the
next
i
remember
was
seeing
a
lady
feeding
my
children
and
a
gentleman
coming
in
with
aunty
graham
yes
said
belle
fortunately
after
i
had
seen
you
i
met
with
clifford
who
rendered
me
every
necessary
assistance
his
presence
was
very
opportune
just
then
belle
turned
her
eyes
toward
the
door
and
saw
clifford
standing
on
the
threshold
ah
said
he
smiling
and
advancing
this
time
the
old
adage
has
failed
which
says
that
listeners
never
hear
any
good
of
themselves
for
without
intending
to
act
the
part
of
an
eavesdropper
i
heard
myself
pleasantly
complimented
no
more
than
you
deserve
said
belle
smiling
and
blushing
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
in
a
very
frank
and
pleasant
manner
gough
is
much
better
this
morning
and
is
very
grateful
to
you
for
your
kindness
mine
said
clifford
if
you
will
call
it
so
was
only
the
result
of
an
accident
still
i
am
very
glad
if
i
have
been
of
any
service
and
you
are
perfectly
welcome
to
make
demands
upon
me
that
will
add
to
mrs
cough
comfort
thank
you
i
am
very
glad
she
has
found
a
friend
in
you
it
is
such
a
blessed
privilege
to
be
able
to
help
others
less
fortunate
than
ourselves
it
certainly
is
just
a
moment
said
belle
as
the
voice
of
gough
fell
faintly
on
her
ear
what
is
it
dear
said
belle
bending
down
to
catch
her
words
who
is
that
gentleman
his
face
and
voice
seem
familiar
it
is
mr
clifford
paul
clifford
yes
do
you
know
him
yes
i
knew
him
years
ago
when
i
was
young
and
happy
but
it
seems
an
age
since
oh
is
it
a
dreadful
thing
to
be
a
drunkard
wife
yes
it
is
but
would
you
like
to
speak
to
mr
clifford
yes
mam
i
would
clifford
said
belle
gough
would
like
to
speak
with
you
do
you
not
know
me
said
mary
looking
anxiously
into
his
face
i
recognized
you
as
soon
as
you
moved
into
the
neighborhood
i
am
very
glad
i
feared
that
i
was
so
changed
that
my
own
dear
mother
would
hardly
recognize
me
do
you
think
she
would
pity
and
forgive
me
if
she
saw
what
a
mournful
wretch
i
am
yes
i
think
she
has
long
forgiven
you
and
longs
to
take
you
to
her
heart
as
warmly
as
she
ever
did
and
my
father
i
believe
he
would
receive
you
but
i
do
think
he
would
be
willing
to
recognize
your
husband
you
know
he
is
very
set
in
his
ways
clifford
i
feel
that
my
days
are
numbered
and
that
my
span
of
life
will
soon
be
done
but
while
i
live
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
cling
to
my
demented
husband
and
to
do
all
i
can
to
turn
him
from
the
error
of
his
ways
but
i
do
so
wish
that
my
poor
children
could
have
my
care
when
i
am
gone
if
i
were
satisfied
on
that
score
i
would
die
content
do
not
talk
of
dying
said
belle
taking
the
pale
thin
hand
in
hers
you
must
try
and
live
for
your
children
sake
when
you
get
strong
i
think
i
can
find
you
some
work
among
my
friends
there
is
roberts
she
often
gives
out
work
and
i
think
i
will
apply
to
her
james
roberts
on
james
near
yes
do
you
know
her
yes
said
gough
closing
her
eyes
wearily
i
know
her
and
have
worked
for
her
i
think
she
is
an
excellent
woman
i
remember
one
morning
we
were
talking
together
on
religious
experience
and
about
women
speaking
in
class
and
conference
meetings
i
said
i
did
not
think
i
should
like
to
constantly
relate
my
experience
in
public
there
was
often
such
a
lack
of
assurance
of
faith
about
me
that
i
shrank
from
holding
up
my
inner
life
to
inspection
and
she
replied
that
she
would
always
say
that
she
loved
jesus
and
i
thought
oh
how
i
would
like
to
have
her
experience
what
rest
and
peace
i
would
have
if
i
could
feel
that
i
was
always
in
harmony
with
him
miss
belle
i
hope
you
will
not
be
offended
with
me
for
i
am
very
ignorant
about
these
matters
but
there
was
something
about
roberts
dealings
with
us
poor
working
people
that
did
seem
to
me
not
to
be
just
what
i
think
religion
calls
for
i
found
her
a
very
hard
person
to
deal
with
she
wanted
so
much
work
for
so
little
money
but
gough
the
times
are
very
hard
and
the
rich
feel
it
as
well
as
the
poor
but
not
so
much
it
curtails
them
in
their
luxuries
and
us
in
our
necessities
perhaps
i
should
mention
but
after
my
husband
had
become
a
confirmed
drunkard
and
all
hope
had
died
out
of
my
heart
i
had
time
to
sit
down
and
brood
helplessly
over
my
misery
i
had
to
struggle
for
my
children
and
if
possible
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
and
besides
food
and
clothing
i
wanted
to
keep
my
children
in
a
respectable
neighborhood
and
my
whole
soul
rose
up
in
revolt
against
the
idea
of
bringing
them
up
where
their
eyes
and
ears
would
be
constantly
smitten
by
improper
sights
and
sounds
while
i
was
worrying
over
my
situation
and
feeling
that
my
health
was
failing
under
the
terrible
pressure
of
care
and
overwork
roberts
brought
me
work
will
you
do
this
for
she
said
displaying
one
of
the
articles
she
wanted
made
i
replied
dollar
and
cents
and
i
knew
the
work
well
worth
it
can
get
it
done
for
one
dollar
she
replied
i
am
not
willing
to
give
any
more
what
could
i
do
i
was
out
of
work
my
health
was
poor
and
my
children
clutching
at
my
heart
strings
for
bread
and
so
i
took
it
at
her
price
it
was
very
unprofitable
but
it
was
better
than
nothing
why
that
is
very
strange
i
know
she
pays
her
dressmaker
handsomely
that
is
because
her
dressmaker
is
in
a
situation
to
dictate
her
own
terms
but
while
she
would
pay
her
a
large
sum
for
dressmaking
she
would
screw
and
pinch
a
piece
from
one
who
had
power
to
resist
her
demands
i
have
seen
people
save
or
fifty
cents
in
dealing
with
poor
people
who
would
squander
ten
times
as
much
on
some
luxury
of
the
table
or
wardrobe
i
often
find
that
meanness
and
extravagance
go
hand
in
hand
yes
that
is
true
still
gough
i
think
people
often
act
like
roberts
more
from
want
of
thought
than
want
of
heart
it
was
an
old
charge
brought
against
the
israelite
people
doth
not
consider
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
said
belle
a
few
mornings
after
this
conversation
as
she
approached
the
bedside
of
mary
gough
i
thought
you
were
getting
along
so
nicely
and
that
with
proper
care
you
would
be
on
your
feet
in
a
few
days
but
this
morning
you
look
so
feeble
and
seem
so
nervous
and
depressed
do
tell
me
what
has
happened
and
what
has
become
of
your
beautiful
hair
oh
you
had
such
a
wealth
of
tresses
i
really
loved
to
toy
with
them
was
your
head
so
painful
that
the
doctor
ordered
them
to
be
cut
oh
no
she
said
burying
her
face
in
the
pillow
and
breaking
into
a
paroxysm
of
tears
oh
miss
belle
how
can
i
tell
you
she
replied
recovering
from
her
sudden
outburst
of
sorrow
why
what
is
it
darling
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
what
has
become
of
your
beautiful
hair
with
gentle
womanly
tact
belle
saw
that
the
loss
of
her
hair
was
a
subject
replete
with
bitter
anguish
and
turning
to
the
children
she
took
them
in
her
lap
and
interested
and
amused
them
by
telling
beautiful
fairy
stories
in
a
short
time
mary
composure
returned
and
she
said
miss
belle
i
can
now
tell
you
how
i
lost
my
hair
last
night
my
husband
or
the
wreck
of
what
was
once
my
husband
came
home
his
eyes
were
wild
and
bloodshot
his
face
was
pale
and
haggard
his
gait
uneven
and
his
hand
trembling
i
have
seen
him
suffering
from
and
dreaded
lest
he
should
have
a
returning
of
it
graham
had
just
stepped
out
and
there
was
no
one
here
but
myself
and
children
he
held
in
his
hand
a
pair
of
shears
and
approached
my
bedside
i
was
ready
to
faint
with
terror
when
he
exclaimed
i
must
have
liquor
or
i
shall
go
wild
he
caught
my
hair
in
his
hand
i
was
too
feeble
to
resist
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
cut
every
lock
from
my
head
and
left
it
just
as
you
see
it
oh
what
a
pity
and
what
a
shame
oh
miss
gordon
do
you
think
the
men
who
make
our
laws
ever
stop
to
consider
the
misery
crime
and
destruction
that
flow
out
of
the
liquor
traffic
i
have
done
all
i
could
to
induce
him
to
abstain
and
he
has
abstained
several
months
at
a
time
and
then
suddenly
like
a
flash
of
lightning
the
temptation
returns
and
all
his
resolutions
are
scattered
like
chaff
before
the
wind
i
have
been
blamed
for
living
with
him
but
miss
belle
were
you
to
see
him
in
his
moments
of
remorse
and
hear
his
bitter
self
reproach
and
his
earnest
resolutions
to
reform
you
would
as
soon
leave
a
drowning
man
to
struggle
alone
in
the
water
as
to
forsake
him
in
his
weakness
when
every
one
else
has
turned
against
him
and
if
i
can
be
the
means
of
saving
him
the
joy
for
his
redemption
will
counterbalance
all
that
i
have
suffered
as
a
drunkard
wife

john
anderson
saloon
the
end
of
these
things
is
death
why
do
you
mix
that
liquor
with
such
care
and
give
it
to
that
child
you
know
he
is
not
going
to
pay
you
for
it
i
am
making
an
investment
how
so
why
you
see
that
boy
parents
are
very
rich
and
in
course
of
time
he
will
be
one
of
my
customers
well
john
anderson
as
old
a
sinner
as
i
am
i
would
do
such
a
thing
for
my
right
hand
what
the
harm
you
are
one
of
my
best
customers
did
liquor
ever
harm
you
yes
it
does
harm
me
and
when
i
see
young
men
beginning
to
drink
i
feel
like
crying
out
man
you
are
in
danger
do
put
your
feet
in
the
terrible
flood
for
ten
to
one
you
will
be
swamped
well
this
is
the
best
joke
of
the
season
tom
cary
preaching
temperance
when
do
you
expect
to
join
the
crusade
but
oh
talk
is
cheap
cheap
or
dear
john
anderson
when
i
saw
you
giving
liquor
to
that
innocent
boy
i
could
help
thinking
of
my
poor
charley
he
was
just
such
a
bright
child
as
that
with
beautiful
brown
eyes
and
a
fine
forehead
ah
that
boy
had
a
mind
he
was
always
ahead
in
his
studies
but
once
when
he
was
about
twelve
years
old
i
let
him
go
on
a
travelling
tour
with
his
uncle
he
was
so
agreeable
and
wide
awake
his
uncle
liked
to
have
him
for
company
but
it
was
a
dear
trip
to
my
poor
charley
during
this
journey
they
stopped
at
a
hotel
and
my
brother
gave
him
a
glass
of
wine
better
for
my
dear
boy
had
he
given
him
a
glass
of
strychnine
that
one
glass
awakened
within
him
a
dreadful
craving
it
raged
like
a
hungry
fire
i
talked
to
him
his
mother
pled
with
him
but
it
was
no
use
liquor
was
his
master
and
when
he
get
liquor
i
known
him
to
break
into
his
pantry
to
get
our
burning
fluid
to
assuage
his
thirst
sometimes
he
would
be
sober
for
several
weeks
at
a
time
and
then
our
hopes
would
brighten
that
charley
would
be
himself
again
and
then
in
an
hour
all
our
hopes
would
be
dashed
to
the
ground
it
seemed
as
if
a
spell
was
upon
him
he
married
a
dear
good
girl
who
was
as
true
as
steel
but
all
her
entreaties
for
him
to
give
up
drinking
were
like
beating
the
air
he
drank
and
drank
until
he
drank
himself
into
the
grave
by
this
time
two
or
three
loungers
had
gathered
around
john
anderson
and
thomas
gary
and
one
of
them
said
gary
you
have
had
sad
experience
why
do
you
give
up
drinking
yourself
give
it
up
because
i
ca
i
would
give
one
half
of
my
farm
if
i
could
pass
by
this
saloon
and
not
feel
that
i
wanted
to
come
in
no
i
feel
that
i
am
a
slave
there
was
a
time
when
i
could
have
broken
my
chain
but
it
is
too
late
now
and
i
say
young
men
take
warning
by
me
and
do
make
slaves
and
fools
of
yourselves
now
tom
cary
said
john
anderson
it
is
time
for
you
to
dry
up
we
have
had
enough
of
this
foolishness
if
you
ca
govern
yourself
the
more
the
pity
for
you
just
then
the
newsboy
came
along
crying
evening
mail
all
about
the
dreadful
murder
john
coots
and
james
loraine
last
edition
buy
a
paper
sir
here
your
last
edition
all
the
dreadful
murder
john
coots
said
several
voices
all
at
once
why
he
been
here
a
half
dozen
times
today
i
drank
with
him
said
one
at
that
bar
twice
since
noon
he
had
a
strange
look
out
of
his
eyes
and
i
heard
him
mutter
something
to
himself
yes
said
another
i
heard
him
say
he
was
going
to
kill
somebody
or
the
other
got
to
die
what
does
the
paper
say
love
jealousy
and
murder
the
old
story
said
anderson
looking
somewhat
relieved
a
woman
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
liquor
said
tom
cary
is
at
the
top
of
it
i
wish
you
would
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
said
anderson
scowling
at
cary
oh
never
mind
tom
will
have
his
say
he
got
a
knack
of
speaking
out
in
meeting
and
a
very
disagreeable
knack
it
is
oh
never
mind
about
tom
read
about
the
murder
and
tend
to
tom
some
other
time
eagerly
and
excitedly
they
read
the
dreadful
news
a
woman
frail
and
vicious
was
at
the
bottom
a
woman
that
neither
of
those
men
would
have
married
as
a
gracious
gift
was
the
guilty
cause
of
one
murder
and
when
the
law
would
take
its
course
two
deaths
would
lie
at
her
door
oh
the
folly
of
some
men
who
instead
of
striving
to
make
home
a
thing
of
beauty
strength
and
grace
wander
into
forbidden
pastures
and
reap
for
themselves
harvests
of
misery
and
disgrace
and
all
for
what
because
of
the
allurements
of
some
idle
vain
and
sinful
woman
who
has
armed
herself
against
the
peace
the
purity
and
the
progress
of
the
fireside
such
women
are
the
dry
rot
in
the
social
fabric
they
dig
in
the
dark
beneath
the
foundation
stones
of
the
home
young
men
enter
their
houses
and
over
the
mirror
of
their
lives
comes
the
shadow
of
pollution
companionship
with
them
unprepares
them
for
the
pure
simple
joys
of
a
happy
and
virtuous
home
a
place
which
should
be
the
best
school
for
the
affections
one
of
the
fairest
spots
on
earth
and
one
of
the
brightest
types
of
heaven
such
a
home
as
this
may
exist
without
wealth
luxury
or
display
but
it
can
not
exist
without
the
essential
elements
of
purity
love
and
truth
the
story
was
read
and
then
came
the
various
comments
oh
it
was
dreadful
said
one
loraine
belongs
to
one
of
the
first
families
in
the
town
and
what
a
cut
it
will
be
to
them
not
simply
that
he
has
been
murdered
but
murdered
where
he
was
in
the
house
of
lizzie
wilson
i
knew
her
before
she
left
husband
and
took
to
evil
courses
oh
what
a
pity
i
expect
it
will
almost
kill
his
wife
poor
thing
i
pity
her
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
why
what
the
matter
harry
richards
you
look
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
you
are
all
of
a
tremor
i
just
come
from
the
coroner
inquest
had
to
be
one
of
the
witnesses
i
am
afraid
it
will
go
hard
with
coots
why
what
was
the
verdict
of
the
jury
they
brought
in
a
verdict
of
death
by
killing
at
the
hands
of
john
coots
were
you
present
at
the
murder
yes
how
did
it
happen
why
you
see
john
had
been
spending
his
money
very
freely
on
lizzie
wilson
and
he
took
it
into
his
head
because
loraine
had
made
her
some
costly
presents
that
she
had
treated
him
rather
coolly
and
wanted
to
ship
him
and
so
he
got
dreadfully
put
out
with
loraine
and
made
some
bitter
threats
against
him
but
i
do
believe
he
would
have
done
the
deed
if
he
had
been
sober
but
he
been
on
a
spree
for
several
days
and
he
was
half
crazy
when
he
did
it
oh
it
was
heartrending
to
see
loraine
wife
when
they
brought
him
home
a
corpse
she
gave
an
awful
shriek
and
fell
to
the
floor
stiff
as
a
poker
and
his
poor
little
children
it
made
my
heart
bleed
to
look
at
them
and
his
poor
old
mother
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
the
death
of
her
in
a
large
city
with
its
varied
interests
one
event
rapidly
chases
the
other
are
stranded
on
the
shores
of
time
pitiful
wrecks
of
humanity
are
dashed
amid
the
rocks
and
reefs
of
existence
old
faces
disappear
and
new
ones
take
their
places
and
the
stream
of
life
ever
hurries
on
to
empty
where
death
waters
meet
at
the
next
sitting
of
the
court
john
coots
was
arraigned
tried
and
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
his
lawyer
tried
to
bring
in
a
plea
of
emotional
insanity
but
failed
if
insane
he
was
insane
through
the
influence
of
strong
drink
it
was
proven
that
he
had
made
fierce
threats
against
the
life
of
loraine
and
the
liquor
in
which
he
had
so
freely
indulged
had
served
to
fire
his
brain
and
nerve
his
hand
to
carry
out
his
wicked
intent
and
so
the
jury
brought
in
its
verdict
and
he
was
sentenced
to
be
executed
which
sentence
was
duly
performed
and
that
closed
another
act
of
the
sad
drama
intemperance
and
sensuality
had
clasped
hands
together
and
beneath
their
cruel
fostering
the
gallows
had
borne
its
dreadful
fruit
of
death
the
light
of
one
home
had
been
quenched
in
gloom
and
guilt
a
husband
had
broken
over
the
barriers
that
god
placed
around
the
path
of
marital
love
and
his
sun
had
gone
down
at
the
sun
which
should
have
gilded
the
horizon
of
life
and
lent
it
additional
charms
had
gone
down
in
darkness
yes
set
behind
the
shadow
of
a
thousand
clouds
innocent
and
unoffending
childhood
was
robbed
of
a
father
care
and
a
once
happy
wife
and
joyful
mother
sat
down
in
her
widow
weeds
with
the
mantle
of
a
gloomier
sorrow
around
her
heart
and
all
for
what
oh
who
will
justify
the
ways
of
god
to
man
who
will
impress
upon
the
mind
of
youth
with
its
impulsiveness
that
it
is
a
privilege
as
well
as
a
duty
to
present
the
body
to
god
as
a
living
sacrifice
holy
and
acceptable
in
his
sight
that
god
gives
man
no
law
that
is
not
for
his
best
advantage
and
that
the
interests
of
humanity
and
the
laws
of
purity
and
all
lie
in
the
same
direction
and
the
man
who
does
not
take
care
of
his
body
must
fail
to
take
the
best
care
of
his
soul
for
the
body
should
be
temple
for
god
holy
spirit
and
the
instrument
to
do
his
work
and
we
have
no
right
to
defile
the
one
or
blunt
the
other
and
thus
render
ourselves
unfit
for
the
master
service
chapter
xiv
belle
gordon
indignation
was
thoroughly
aroused
by
hearing
mary
gough
story
about
the
loss
of
her
hair
and
she
made
up
her
mind
that
when
she
saw
joe
gough
she
would
give
him
a
very
plain
talking
i
would
like
to
see
your
husband
i
would
just
like
to
tell
him
what
i
think
about
his
conduct
oh
said
mary
her
pale
cheek
growing
whiter
with
apprehension
that
his
footsteps
now
miss
belle
do
say
anything
to
him
as
good
and
kind
a
man
as
i
ever
saw
when
he
is
sober
but
sometimes
he
is
really
ugly
when
he
has
been
drinking
just
then
the
door
was
opened
and
joe
gough
entered
or
rather
all
that
remained
of
the
once
witty
talented
and
handsome
josiah
gough
his
face
was
pale
and
haggard
and
growing
premature
by
age
his
wealth
of
raven
hair
was
unkempt
and
hung
in
tangled
locks
over
his
forehead
his
hand
was
unsteady
and
trembling
from
extreme
nervousness
but
he
was
sober
enough
to
comprehend
the
situation
and
to
feel
a
deep
sense
of
remorse
and
shame
when
he
gazed
upon
the
weary
head
from
whence
he
had
bereft
its
magnificent
covering
here
mary
said
he
approaching
the
bed
i
brought
you
a
present
i
only
had
four
cents
and
i
thought
this
would
please
you
i
know
you
women
are
so
fond
of
and
he
handed
her
a
pair
of
sleeve
buttons
thank
you
said
she
as
a
faint
smile
illuminated
her
pallid
cheek
this
she
said
turning
to
miss
gordon
is
my
husband
josiah
gough
good
morning
gough
said
belle
bowing
politely
and
extending
her
hand
joe
returned
the
salutation
very
courteously
and
very
quietly
sitting
down
by
the
bedside
made
some
remarks
about
the
dampness
of
the
weather
mary
lay
very
quiet
looking
pitifully
upon
the
mour
n
ful
wretch
at
her
side
who
seemed
to
regard
her
and
her
friend
with
intense
interest
it
seemed
from
his
countenance
that
remorse
and
shame
were
rousing
up
his
better
nature
once
he
rose
as
if
to
go
stood
irresolutely
for
a
moment
and
then
sitting
down
by
the
bedside
clasped
her
thin
pale
hand
in
his
with
a
caressing
motion
and
said
mary
you
had
a
hard
time
but
i
hope
there
are
better
days
in
store
for
us
do
get
out
of
heart
and
there
was
a
moisture
in
his
eyes
in
which
for
a
moment
beamed
a
tender
loving
light
belle
immediately
felt
her
indignation
changing
to
pity
surely
she
thought
within
herself
this
man
is
worth
saving
there
is
still
love
and
tenderness
within
him
notwithstanding
all
his
he
reminds
me
of
an
expression
i
have
picked
up
somewhere
about
old
oak
holding
the
young
fibres
at
its
heart
i
will
appeal
to
that
better
nature
i
will
use
it
as
a
lever
to
lift
him
from
the
depths
into
which
he
has
fallen
while
she
was
thinking
of
the
best
way
to
approach
him
and
how
to
reach
that
heart
into
whose
hidden
depths
she
had
so
unexpectedly
glanced
he
arose
and
bending
over
his
wife
imprinted
upon
her
lips
a
kiss
in
which
remorse
and
shame
seemed
struggling
for
expression
and
left
the
room
mother
graham
said
belle
a
happy
thought
has
just
struck
me
could
we
induce
gough
to
attend
the
meeting
of
the
reform
club
speaks
tonight
and
he
has
been
meeting
with
glorious
success
as
a
temperance
reformer
hundreds
of
men
many
of
them
confirmed
drunkards
have
joined
and
he
is
doing
a
remarkable
work
he
does
not
wait
for
the
drunkards
to
come
to
him
he
goes
to
them
and
wins
them
by
his
personal
sympathy
and
it
is
wonderful
the
good
he
has
done
i
do
wish
he
would
go
i
wish
so
too
said
martha
graham
if
he
should
not
return
while
i
am
here
will
you
invite
him
to
attend
perhaps
gough
can
spare
you
an
hour
or
two
this
evening
to
accompany
him
that
i
would
gladly
do
i
think
it
would
do
me
more
good
than
all
the
medicines
you
could
give
me
to
see
my
poor
husband
himself
once
more
before
he
took
to
drinking
i
was
so
happy
but
it
seems
as
if
since
then
i
have
suffered
sorrow
by
the
spoonful
oh
the
misery
that
this
drink
causes
i
do
hope
these
reform
clubs
will
be
the
means
of
shutting
up
every
saloon
in
the
place
for
just
as
long
as
one
of
them
is
open
he
is
in
danger
yes
said
belle
what
we
need
is
not
simply
to
stop
the
men
from
drinking
but
to
keep
the
temptation
out
of
their
way
joe
said
mary
belongs
to
a
good
family
he
has
a
education
is
a
fine
penman
and
a
good
bookkeeper
but
this
dreadful
drink
has
thrown
him
out
of
some
of
the
best
situations
in
the
town
where
we
were
living
oh
what
a
pity
i
heard
clifford
say
that
his
business
was
increasing
so
that
he
wanted
a
good
clerk
and
salesman
to
help
him
that
he
was
overworked
and
crippled
for
want
of
sufficient
help
maybe
if
your
husband
would
sign
the
pledge
clifford
would
give
him
a
trial
but
it
is
growing
late
and
i
must
go
i
would
liked
to
have
seen
your
husband
before
i
left
and
have
given
him
a
personal
invitation
but
you
and
mother
graham
can
invite
him
for
me
so
good
bye
keep
up
a
good
heart
you
know
where
to
cast
your
burden
just
as
miss
gordon
reached
the
landing
she
saw
joe
gough
standing
at
the
outer
door
and
laying
her
hand
gently
upon
his
shoulder
exclaimed
oh
gough
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
again
i
wanted
to
invite
you
to
attend
a
temperance
meeting
tonight
at
amory
hall
will
you
go
well
i
do
like
to
promise
he
replied
looking
down
upon
his
seedy
coat
and
dilapidated
shoes
never
mind
your
wardrobe
said
miss
gordon
divining
his
thoughts
the
soul
is
more
than
raiment
world
has
room
for
another
man
and
i
want
you
to
fill
the
place
well
said
he
i
come
very
well
i
expect
to
be
there
and
will
look
for
you
come
early
and
bring
mother
graham
gough
can
spare
her
an
hour
or
two
this
evening
i
think
your
wife
is
suffering
more
from
exhaustion
and
debility
than
anything
else
yes
poor
mary
has
had
a
hard
time
but
it
sha
be
always
so
as
soon
as
i
get
work
i
mean
to
take
her
out
of
this
said
he
looking
disdainfully
at
the
wretched
tenement
house
with
its
broken
shutters
and
look
of
general
decay
why
mother
graham
is
the
meeting
over
you
must
have
had
a
fine
time
you
just
look
delighted
did
joe
go
in
with
you
and
where
is
he
now
yes
he
went
with
me
listened
to
the
speeches
and
joined
the
club
i
saw
him
do
it
with
my
own
eyes
oh
we
had
a
glorious
time
oh
i
am
so
glad
said
mary
her
eyes
filling
with
sudden
tears
i
do
hope
he
will
keep
his
pledge
i
hope
so
too
and
i
hope
he
will
get
something
to
do
clifford
was
there
when
he
signed
and
miss
belle
was
saying
today
that
he
wanted
a
clerk
that
would
be
a
first
r
at
e
place
for
joe
if
he
will
only
keep
his
pledge
clifford
is
an
active
temperance
man
and
i
believe
would
help
to
keep
joe
straight
i
hope
he
get
the
place
but
mother
graham
tell
me
all
about
the
meeting
you
do
know
how
happy
i
am
do
i
deary
have
i
been
through
it
all
but
it
seems
as
if
i
had
passed
through
suffering
into
peace
but
never
mind
mother
graham
past
troubles
let
me
tell
you
about
the
meeting
at
these
meetings
quite
a
number
of
people
speak
just
as
we
went
in
one
of
the
speakers
was
telling
his
experience
and
what
a
terrible
struggle
he
had
to
overcome
the
power
of
appetite
now
when
he
felt
the
fearful
craving
coming
over
him
he
would
walk
the
carpet
till
he
had
actually
worn
it
threadbare
but
that
he
had
been
converted
and
found
grace
to
help
him
in
time
of
need
and
how
he
had
gone
out
and
tried
to
reform
others
and
had
seen
the
work
prosper
in
his
hand
i
watched
face
it
seemed
lit
up
with
earnestness
and
hope
as
if
that
man
had
brought
him
a
message
of
deliverance
then
after
the
meeting
came
the
signing
of
the
pledge
and
joining
the
reform
club
and
it
would
have
done
you
good
to
see
the
men
that
joined
do
you
remember
thomas
allison
yes
poor
fellow
and
i
think
if
any
man
ever
inherited
drunkenness
he
did
for
his
father
and
his
mother
were
drunkards
before
him
well
he
joined
and
they
have
made
him
president
of
the
club
well
did
i
ever
but
tell
me
all
about
joe
when
the
speaking
was
over
joe
sat
still
and
thoughtful
as
if
making
up
his
mind
when
miss
gordon
came
to
him
and
asked
him
to
join
he
stopped
a
minute
to
button
his
coat
and
went
right
straight
up
and
had
his
name
put
down
but
oh
how
the
people
did
clap
and
shout
well
as
joe
was
one
of
the
last
to
sign
the
red
ribbons
they
use
for
badges
was
all
gone
and
joe
looked
so
sorry
he
said
he
wanted
to
take
a
piece
of
ribbon
home
to
let
his
wife
know
that
he
belonged
to
the
reform
club
miss
gordon
heard
him
and
she
had
a
piece
of
black
lace
and
red
ribbon
twisted
together
around
her
throat
and
she
separated
the
lace
from
the
ribbon
and
tied
it
in
his
so
his
mary
would
see
it
oh
miss
belle
did
look
so
sweet
and
clifford
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
i
think
he
admires
her
very
much
i
do
see
how
he
can
help
it
she
is
one
of
the
dearest
sweetest
ladies
i
ever
saw
she
never
seemed
to
say
by
her
actions
am
doing
so
much
for
you
poor
people
and
you
ca
be
too
thankful
not
she
and
between
you
and
i
and
the
i
think
that
will
be
a
match
i
think
it
would
make
a
splendid
one
but
hush
i
hear
some
persons
coming
the
door
opened
and
paul
clifford
joe
gough
and
belle
gordon
entered
here
gough
said
paul
clifford
as
we
children
used
to
say
here
your
husband

and
sound
and
i
will
add
a
member
of
our
reformed
club
and
we
have
come
to
congratulate
you

the
event

dear
friends

am
very
thankful
to

your
great
kindness

be
able
to

be
uneasy
darling
said
belle
we
are
getting
our
pay
as
we
go
along
we
do
think
the
cause
of
humanity
owes
us
anything
yes
said
joe
seating
himself
by
the
bed
side
with
an
air
of
intense
gratification
here
is
my
badge
i
did
not
want
to
leave
the
meeting
without
having
this
to
show
you
this
evening
said
gough
smiling
through
her
tears
reminds
me
of
a
little
temperance
song
i
learned
when
a
child
i
think
it
commenced
with
these
words
and
are
you
sure
the
news
is
true
are
you
sure
my
john
has
joined
i
ca
believe
the
happy
news
and
leave
my
fears
behind
if
john
has
joined
and
drinks
no
more
the
happiest
wife
am
i
that
ever
swept
a
cabin
floor
or
sung
a
lullaby
that
just
the
way
i
feel
i
have
been
so
happy
before
for
years
and
i
hope
said
clifford
that
you
will
have
many
happy
days
and
nights
in
the
future
and
i
hope
so
too
said
joe
shaking
hands
with
paul
and
belle
as
they
rose
to
go
clifford
accompanied
belle
to
her
door
and
as
they
parted
she
said
this
is
a
glorious
work
in
which
it
is
our
privilege
to
clasp
hands
it
is
and
i
hope
but
as
the
words
rose
to
his
lips
he
looked
into
the
face
of
belle
and
it
was
so
radiant
with
intelligent
tenderness
and
joy
that
she
seemed
to
him
almost
like
a
glorified
saint
a
being
too
precious
high
and
good
for
common
household
uses
and
so
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
died
upon
his
lips
and
he
held
his
peace
chapter
xv
i
have
resolved
to
dissolve
partnership
with
charles
said
augustine
romaine
to
his
wife
the
next
morning
after
his
son
return
from
the
champaign
supper
at
john
anderson
oh
no
you
are
not
in
earnest
are
you
you
seem
suddenly
to
have
lost
all
patience
with
charlie
yes
i
have
and
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
i
am
not
going
to
let
him
hang
like
a
millstone
on
our
business
no
if
he
will
go
down
i
am
determined
he
shall
not
drag
me
down
with
him
see
what
a
hurt
it
would
be
to
us
to
have
it
said
trust
your
case
with
the
romaine
for
the
junior
member
of
that
firm
is
a
confirmed
drunkard
well
augustine
you
ought
to
know
best
but
it
seems
like
casting
him
off
to
dissolve
partnership
with
him
i
ca
help
it
if
he
persists
in
his
downward
course
he
must
take
the
consequences
charles
has
had
every
advantage
when
other
young
lawyers
have
had
to
battle
year
after
year
with
obscurity
and
poverty
he
entered
into
a
business
that
was
already
established
and
flourishing
what
other
men
were
struggling
for
he
found
ready
made
to
his
hand
and
if
he
chooses
to
throw
away
every
advantage
and
make
a
complete
wreck
of
himself
i
ca
help
it
oh
it
does
seem
so
dreadful
i
wonder
what
will
become
of
my
poor
boy
now
mother
i
want
you
to
look
at
this
thing
in
the
light
of
reason
and
common
sense
i
am
not
turning
charles
out
of
the
house
he
is
not
poor
though
the
way
he
is
going
on
he
will
be
you
know
his
grandfather
has
left
him
a
large
estate
out
west
which
is
constantly
increasing
in
value
now
what
i
mean
to
do
is
to
give
charles
a
chance
to
set
up
for
himself
as
attorney
wherever
he
pleases
throwing
him
on
his
own
resources
with
a
sense
of
responsibility
may
be
the
best
thing
for
him
but
in
the
present
state
of
things
i
do
not
think
it
advisable
to
continue
our
business
relations
together
for
more
than
years
our
firm
has
stood
foremost
at
the
bar
ever
since
my
brother
and
i
commenced
business
together
our
reputation
has
been
unspotted
and
i
mean
to
keep
it
so
if
i
have
to
cut
off
my
right
hand
romaine
gazed
upon
the
stern
sad
face
of
her
husband
and
felt
by
the
determination
of
his
manner
that
it
was
useless
to
entreat
or
reason
with
him
to
change
his
purpose
and
so
with
a
heavy
heart
and
eyes
drooping
with
unshed
tears
she
left
the
room
john
said
romaine
to
the
waiter
tell
charles
i
wish
to
see
him
before
i
go
down
to
the
office
just
then
charles
entered
the
room
and
bade
good
morning
to
his
father
good
morning
replied
his
father
rather
coldly
and
for
a
moment
there
was
an
awkward
silence
charles
said
romaine
after
having
witnessed
the
scene
of
last
night
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
to
dissolve
the
partnership
between
us
just
as
you
please
said
charles
in
a
tone
of
cold
indifference
that
irritated
his
father
but
he
maintained
his
i
am
sorry
that
you
will
persist
in
your
downward
course
but
if
you
are
determined
to
throw
yourself
away
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
cut
loose
from
you
i
noticed
last
week
when
you
were
getting
out
the
briefs
in
that
sumpter
case
you
were
not
yourself
and
several
times
lately
you
have
made
me
hang
my
head
in
the
court
room
i
am
sorry
very
sorry
and
a
touch
of
deep
emotion
gave
a
tone
of
tenderness
to
the
closing
sentence
there
was
a
slight
huskiness
in
charles
voice
as
he
replied
whenever
the
articles
of
dissolution
are
made
out
i
am
ready
to
sign
they
shall
be
ready
by
all
right
i
will
sign
them
and
what
then
set
up
for
myself
the
world
is
wide
enough
for
us
both
after
romaine
had
left
the
room
charles
sat
burying
his
head
in
his
hands
and
indulging
bitter
thoughts
toward
his
father
he
said
to
himself
he
resolved
to
cut
loose
from
me
apparently
forgetting
that
it
was
from
his
hands
and
at
his
table
i
received
my
first
glass
of
wine
he
prides
himself
on
his
power
of
and
after
all
what
does
it
amount
to
it
simply
means
this
that
he
has
an
iron
constitution
and
can
drink
five
times
as
much
as
i
can
without
showing
its
effects
and
if
would
ask
him
to
sign
the
pledge
he
would
hear
to
it
yes
i
am
ready
to
sign
any
articles
he
will
bring
even
if
it
is
to
sign
never
to
enter
this
house
or
see
his
face
but
my
mother
poor
mother
i
am
sorry
for
her
sake
just
then
his
mother
entered
the
room
my
son
mother
just
what
i
feared
has
come
to
pass
i
have
dreaded
more
than
anything
else
this
collision
with
your
father
now
mother
do
be
so
serious
about
this
matter
father
law
office
does
not
take
in
the
whole
world
i
shall
either
set
up
for
myself
in
or
go
west
oh
do
talk
of
going
away
i
think
i
should
die
of
anxiety
if
you
were
away
well
as
i
passed
down
the
street
yesterday
i
saw
there
was
an
office
to
let
in
frazier
new
block
and
i
think
i
will
engage
it
and
put
out
my
sign
how
will
that
suit
you
anything
or
anywhere
charlie
so
you
are
near
me
and
charlie
be
too
stout
with
your
father
he
was
very
much
out
of
temper
when
you
came
home
last
night
but
be
calm
it
will
blow
over
in
a
few
days
do
add
fuel
to
the
fire
and
you
know
that
you
and
miss
roland
are
to
be
married
in
two
weeks
and
i
do
wish
that
things
might
remain
as
they
are
at
least
till
after
the
wedding
separation
just
now
might
give
rise
to
some
very
unpleasant
talk
and
i
would
rather
if
you
and
your
father
can
put
off
this
dissolution
that
you
will
consent
to
let
things
remain
as
they
are
for
a
few
weeks
longer
when
your
father
comes
home
i
will
put
the
case
to
him
and
have
the
thing
delayed
just
now
charles
i
dread
the
consequences
of
a
separation
well
mother
just
as
you
please
perhaps
the
publication
of
the
articles
of
dissolution
in
the
paper
might
complicate
matters
when
romaine
returned
home
his
wrath
was
somewhat
mollified
and
romaine
having
taken
care
to
prepare
his
favorite
dishes
for
dinner
took
the
opportunity
when
he
had
dined
to
entreat
him
to
delay
the
intended
separation
till
after
the
wedding
to
which
he
very
graciously
consented
again
there
was
a
merry
gathering
at
the
home
of
jeanette
roland
it
was
her
wedding
night
and
she
was
about
to
clasp
hands
for
life
with
charles
romaine
true
to
her
idea
of
taking
things
as
she
found
them
she
had
consented
to
be
his
wife
without
demanding
of
him
any
reformation
from
the
habit
which
was
growing
so
fearfully
upon
him
his
wealth
and
position
in
society
like
charity
covered
a
multitude
of
sins
at
times
jeanette
felt
misgivings
about
the
step
she
was
about
to
take
but
she
put
back
the
thoughts
like
unwelcome
intruders
and
like
the
ostrich
hiding
her
head
in
the
sand
instead
of
avoiding
the
danger
she
shut
her
eyes
to
its
fearful
reality
that
night
the
wine
flowed
out
like
a
purple
flood
but
the
men
and
women
who
drank
were
people
of
culture
wealth
and
position
and
did
not
seem
to
think
it
was
just
as
disgraceful
or
more
so
to
drink
in
excess
in
magnificently
furnished
parlors
as
it
was
in
low
barrooms
or
miserable
dens
where
vice
and
poverty
are
huddled
together
and
if
the
weary
children
of
hunger
and
hard
toil
instead
of
seeking
sleep
as
nature
sweet
restorer
sought
to
stimulate
their
flagging
energies
in
the
enticing
cup
they
with
the
advantages
of
wealth
culture
and
refinement
could
not
plead
the
excuses
of
extreme
wretchedness
or
hard
and
unremitting
drudgery
how
beautiful
very
beautiful
fell
like
a
pleasant
ripple
upon
the
ear
of
jeanette
roland
as
she
approached
the
altar
beneath
her
wreath
of
orange
blossoms
while
her
bridal
veil
floated
like
a
cloud
of
lovely
mist
from
her
fair
young
head
the
vows
were
spoken
the
bridal
ring
placed
upon
her
finger
and
amid
a
train
of
congratulating
friends
she
returned
home
where
a
sumptuous
feast
awaited
them
do
talk
so
loud
but
i
think
belle
gordon
acted
wisely
when
she
refused
romaine
said
gladstone
one
of
the
guests
do
you
indeed
why
charles
romaine
is
the
only
son
of
romaine
and
besides
being
the
heir
he
has
lately
received
a
large
legacy
from
his
grandfather
estate
i
think
jeanette
has
made
a
splendid
match
i
hope
my
girls
will
do
as
well
i
hope
on
the
other
hand
that
my
girls
will
never
marry
unless
they
do
better
why
how
you
talk
what
the
matter
with
mr
romaine
look
at
him
now
said
fallard
joining
in
the
conversation
this
is
his
wedding
night
and
yet
you
can
plainly
see
he
is
under
the
influence
of
wine
look
at
those
eyes
do
you
know
how
beautiful
and
clear
they
are
when
he
is
sober
and
how
very
interesting
he
is
in
conversation
now
look
at
him
see
how
muddled
his
eye
is
but
he
is
approaching
listen
to
his
utterance
do
you
notice
how
thick
it
is
now
if
on
his
wedding
night
he
can
not
abstain
i
have
very
grave
fears
for
jeanette
future
perhaps
you
are
both
right
but
i
never
looked
at
things
in
that
light
before
and
i
know
that
a
magnificent
fortune
can
melt
like
snow
in
the
hands
of
a
drunken
man
i
wish
you
much
joy
rang
out
a
dozen
voices
as
jeanette
approached
them
oh
jeanette
you
just
look
splendid
and
romaine
oh
he
is
so
handsome
oh
jeanette
what
to
hinder
you
from
being
so
happy
but
where
is
romaine
we
have
missed
him
for
some
time
i
do
know
let
me
seek
my
husband
is
that
a
mouthful
said
jeanette
laughingly
disengaging
herself
from
the
merry
group
as
an
undefined
sense
of
apprehension
swept
over
her
was
it
a
presentiment
of
coming
danger
an
unspoken
prophecy
to
be
verified
by
bitter
tears
and
lonely
fear
that
seemed
for
a
moment
to
turn
life
sweetness
into
bitterness
and
gall
in
the
midst
of
a
noisy
group
in
the
dining
room
she
found
charles
drinking
the
wine
as
it
gave
its
color
aright
in
the
cup
she
saw
the
deep
flush
upon
his
cheek
and
the
cloudiness
of
his
eye
and
for
the
first
time
upon
that
bridal
night
she
felt
a
shiver
of
fear
as
the
veil
was
suddenly
lifted
before
her
unwilling
eye
and
half
reluctantly
she
said
to
herself
suppose
after
all
my
cousin
belle
was
right
chapter
xvi
good
morning
clifford
said
joe
gough
entering
the
store
of
paul
clifford
the
next
day
after
he
joined
the
reform
club
i
have
heard
that
you
wanted
some
one
to
help
you
and
i
am
ready
to
do
anything
to
make
an
honest
living
i
am
very
sorry
said
paul
but
i
have
just
engaged
a
young
man
belonging
to
our
club
to
come
this
morning
joe
looked
sad
but
not
discouraged
and
said
clifford
i
want
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
in
my
life
but
everyone
does
not
know
that
do
you
know
of
any
situation
i
can
get
i
have
been
a
and
a
salesman
in
the
town
of
where
i
once
lived
but
i
am
willing
to
begin
almost
anywhere
on
the
ladder
of
life
and
make
it
a
to
something
better
there
was
a
tone
of
earnestness
in
his
voice
and
an
air
of
determination
in
his
manner
that
favorably
impressed
paul
clifford
and
he
replied
i
was
thinking
of
a
friend
of
mine
who
wants
a
helping
hand
but
it
may
not
be
after
all
the
kind
of
work
you
prefer
he
wants
a
porter
but
as
you
say
you
want
to
make
your
position
a
to
something
better
if
you
make
up
your
mind
to
do
your
level
best
the
way
may
open
before
you
in
some
more
congenial
and
unexpected
quarter
wait
a
few
minutes
and
i
will
give
you
a
line
to
him
no
i
can
do
better
than
that
he
is
a
member
of
our
club
and
i
will
see
him
myself
but
before
you
do
had
we
better
not
go
to
the
barber
i
would
like
to
said
joe
but
i
have
have
the
money
yes
clifford
that
the
fact
i
am
not
able
to
pay
even
for
a
shave
oh
what
a
fool
i
have
been
oh
well
never
mind
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
the
future
is
before
you
try
and
redeem
that
if
you
accept
it
i
will
lend
you
a
few
dollars
i
believe
in
lending
a
helping
hand
so
come
with
me
to
the
barber
and
i
make
it
all
right
you
can
pay
me
when
you
are
able
but
here
we
are
at
the
door
let
us
go
in
they
entered
and
in
a
few
moments
joe
face
was
under
the
manipulating
care
of
the
barber
fix
this
so
said
joe
to
the
barber
giving
him
directions
how
to
cut
his
mustache
paul
was
somewhat
amused
and
yet
in
that
simple
act
he
saw
a
return
of
and
was
glad
to
see
its
slightest
manifestations
and
it
was
pleasant
to
witness
the
satisfaction
with
which
joe
beheld
himself
in
the
glass
as
he
exclaimed
why
mary
would
hardly
know
me
suppose
now
we
go
to
the
tailor
and
get
some
new
rigging
clifford
said
joe
hesitatingly
you
are
very
kind
but
i
know
when
i
shall
be
able
to
pay
you
and
oh
never
mind
when
you
are
able
i
will
send
my
bill
it
will
help
you
in
looking
for
a
place
to
go
decently
dressed
so
let
us
go
into
the
store
and
get
a
new
suit
they
entered
a
clothing
store
and
in
a
few
moments
joe
was
dressed
in
a
new
suit
which
made
him
look
almost
like
another
person
now
we
are
ready
said
paul
appearances
are
not
so
much
against
you
good
morning
tennant
said
paul
to
the
proprietor
of
a
large
store
i
heard
last
night
that
you
wanted
help
in
your
store
and
i
have
brought
you
gough
who
is
willing
to
take
any
situation
you
will
give
him
and
i
will
add
he
is
a
member
of
our
reform
club
tennant
looked
thoughtfully
a
moment
and
replied
i
have
only
one
vacancy
and
i
do
not
think
it
would
suit
your
friend
my
porter
died
yesterday
and
that
is
the
only
situation
which
i
can
offer
him
at
present
i
will
accept
it
said
joe
if
you
will
give
it
to
me
i
am
willing
to
do
anything
to
make
an
honest
living
for
my
family
well
you
can
come
or
stop
now
and
begin
all
right
said
joe
with
a
promptness
that
pleased
his
employer
and
joe
was
installed
in
the
first
day
regular
work
he
had
had
for
months
what
sitting
up
sewing
said
belle
gordon
entering
the
neat
room
where
gough
was
rejuvenating
a
dress
for
her
older
daughter
why
you
look
like
another
woman
your
cheeks
are
getting
plump
your
eyes
are
brightening
and
you
look
so
happy
i
feel
just
like
i
look
miss
gordon
joe
has
grown
so
steady
he
gets
constant
work
and
he
is
providing
so
well
for
us
all
and
he
wo
hear
to
me
taking
again
that
work
he
says
all
he
wants
me
to
do
is
to
get
well
and
take
care
of
the
home
and
children
but
you
look
rather
pale
have
you
been
sick
yes
i
have
been
rather
unwell
for
several
weeks
and
the
doctor
has
ordered
among
other
things
that
i
should
have
a
plentiful
supply
of
fresh
air
so
as
there
is
to
be
a
free
excursion
and
i
am
on
the
committee
i
think
if
nothing
prevents
i
shall
go
perhaps
you
would
like
to
go
yes
if
joe
will
consent
but
but
what
well
joe
has
pretty
high
notions
and
i
think
he
may
object
because
it
is
receiving
charity
i
ca
blame
him
for
it
but
joe
has
a
right
smart
of
pride
that
way
no
i
do
blame
him
i
rather
admire
his
spirit
of
and
i
would
lay
the
weight
of
my
smallest
finger
upon
his
to
repress
it
still
i
would
like
to
see
your
mamy
and
hatty
have
a
chance
to
get
out
into
the
woods
and
have
what
i
call
a
good
time
i
think
i
can
have
it
so
arranged
that
you
can
go
with
me
and
serve
as
one
of
the
committee
on
refreshments
and
your
services
would
be
an
ample
compensation
for
your
entertainment
well
if
you
put
it
in
that
light
i
think
joe
would
be
willing
for
me
to
go
i
will
leave
the
matter
there
and
when
your
husband
comes
home
you
can
consult
him
and
send
me
word
and
so
you
are
getting
along
nicely
oh
yes
indeed
splendidly
just
look
here
this
is
joe
present
and
mary
held
up
with
both
hands
a
beautifully
embossed
and
illustrated
bible
this
was
my
present
oh
miss
belle
joe
seems
to
me
like
another
man
last
night
we
went
to
a
conference
and
and
joe
spoke
did
you
know
he
had
joined
the
church
no
when
did
that
happen
last
week
has
he
become
religious
well
i
think
joe
trying
to
do
the
best
he
can
he
said
last
night
in
meeting
that
he
felt
like
a
new
man
and
if
they
did
believe
he
had
religion
to
ask
his
wife
and
suppose
they
had
asked
you
what
would
you
have
said
i
would
have
said
i
believe
joe
a
changed
man
and
i
hope
he
will
hold
out
faithful
and
miss
belle
i
want
to
be
a
christian
but
there
are
some
things
about
religion
i
ca
understand
people
often
used
to
talk
to
me
about
getting
religion
and
getting
ready
to
die
religion
somehow
got
associated
in
my
mind
with
sorrow
and
death
but
it
seems
to
me
since
i
have
known
you
and
clifford
the
thing
looks
different
i
got
it
associated
with
something
else
besides
the
pall
the
hearse
and
weeping
mourners
you
have
made
me
feel
that
it
is
as
beautiful
and
valuable
for
life
as
it
is
necessary
for
death
and
yet
there
are
some
things
i
ca
understand
miss
belle
will
you
be
shocked
if
i
tell
you
something
which
has
often
puzzled
me
i
do
know
i
hope
you
have
nothing
very
shocking
to
tell
me
well
perhaps
it
is
and
maybe
i
had
better
not
say
it
but
you
have
raised
my
curiosity
and
woman
like
i
want
to
hear
it
now
do
be
shocked
but
let
me
ask
you
if
you
really
believe
that
god
is
good
yes
i
do
and
to
doubt
it
would
be
to
unmoor
my
soul
from
love
from
peace
and
rest
it
seems
to
me
to
believe
that
must
be
the
first
resting
place
for
my
soul
and
i
feel
that
with
me
to
doubt
would
be
disloyalty
to
falter
would
be
sin
but
my
dear
i
have
been
puzzled
just
as
you
have
and
can
say
i
have
wandered
in
mazes
dark
and
distressing
i
had
not
a
cheering
ray
my
spirit
to
bless
cheerless
unbelief
held
my
laboring
soul
in
grief
and
what
then
i
then
turned
to
the
gospel
that
taught
me
to
pray
and
trust
in
the
living
word
from
folly
away
and
it
was
here
my
spirit
found
a
resting
place
and
i
feel
that
in
believing
i
have
entered
into
rest
ah
said
mary
to
herself
when
belle
was
gone
there
is
something
so
restful
and
yet
inspiring
in
her
words
i
wish
i
had
her
faith
chapter
xvii
i
am
sorry
very
sorry
said
belle
gordon
as
a
shadow
of
deep
distress
flitted
over
her
pale
sad
face
she
was
usually
cheerful
and
serene
in
her
manner
but
now
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
depths
of
her
soul
had
been
stirred
by
some
mournful
and
bitter
memory
your
question
was
so
unexpected
and
and
what
said
paul
in
a
tone
of
sad
expectancy
so
unwelcome
it
was
so
sudden
i
was
not
prepared
for
it
i
do
not
said
paul
ask
an
immediate
reply
give
yourself
ample
time
for
consideration
clifford
said
belle
her
voice
gathering
firmness
as
she
proceeded
while
all
the
relations
of
life
demand
that
there
should
be
entire
truthfulness
between
us
and
our
fellow
creatures
i
think
we
should
be
especially
sincere
and
candid
in
our
dealings
with
each
other
on
this
question
of
marriage
a
question
not
only
as
affecting
our
own
welfare
but
that
of
others
a
relation
which
may
throw
its
sunshine
or
shadow
over
the
track
of
unborn
ages
permit
me
now
to
say
to
you
that
there
is
no
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
whom
i
esteem
more
highly
than
yourself
but
when
you
ask
me
for
my
heart
and
hand
i
almost
feel
as
if
i
had
no
heart
to
give
and
you
know
it
would
be
wrong
to
give
my
hand
where
i
could
not
place
my
heart
but
would
it
be
impossible
for
you
to
return
my
affection
i
know
but
i
am
only
living
out
my
vow
of
truthfulness
when
i
say
to
you
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
undone
for
love
you
tell
that
in
offering
your
hand
that
you
bring
me
a
heart
unhackneyed
in
the
arts
of
love
that
my
heart
is
the
first
and
only
shrine
on
which
you
have
ever
laid
the
wealth
of
your
affections
i
can
not
say
the
same
in
reply
i
have
had
my
bright
and
beautiful
day
dream
but
it
has
faded
and
i
have
learned
what
is
the
hardest
of
all
lessons
for
a
woman
to
learn
i
have
learned
to
live
without
love
oh
no
said
paul
not
to
live
without
love
in
darkened
homes
how
many
grateful
hearts
rejoice
to
hear
your
footsteps
on
the
threshold
i
have
seen
the
eyes
of
young
arabs
of
the
street
grow
brighter
as
you
approached
and
say
my
lady
she
comes
to
see
my
mam
when
sick
and
i
have
seen
little
girls
in
the
street
quicken
their
face
to
catch
a
loving
smile
from
their
dear
sunday
school
teacher
oh
miss
belle
instead
of
living
without
love
i
think
you
are
surrounded
with
a
cordon
of
loving
hearts
yes
and
i
appreciate
them
but
this
is
not
the
love
to
which
i
refer
i
mean
a
love
which
is
mine
as
anything
else
on
earth
is
mine
a
love
precious
enduring
and
strong
which
brings
hope
and
joy
and
sunshine
over
one
path
in
life
a
love
which
commands
my
allegiance
and
demands
my
respect
this
is
the
love
i
have
learned
to
do
without
and
perhaps
the
poor
and
needy
had
learned
to
love
me
less
had
this
love
surrounded
me
more
miss
belle
perhaps
i
was
presumptuous
to
have
asked
a
return
of
the
earnest
affection
i
have
for
you
but
i
had
hoped
that
you
would
give
the
question
some
consideration
and
may
i
not
hope
that
you
will
think
kindly
of
my
proposal
oh
miss
gordon
ever
since
the
death
of
my
sainted
mother
i
have
had
in
my
mind
eye
the
ideal
of
a
woman
nobly
planned
beautiful
intellectual
true
and
affectionate
and
you
have
filled
out
that
ideal
in
all
its
loveliest
proportions
and
i
hope
that
my
desire
will
not
be
like
reaching
out
to
some
bright
particular
star
and
wishing
to
win
it
it
seems
to
me
he
said
with
increasing
earnestness
whatever
obstacle
may
be
in
the
way
i
would
go
through
fire
and
water
to
remove
it
i
am
sorry
said
belle
as
if
speaking
to
herself
and
her
face
had
an
absent
look
about
it
as
if
instead
of
being
interested
in
the
living
present
she
was
grouping
amid
the
ashes
of
the
dead
past
at
length
she
said
clifford
permit
me
to
say
in
the
first
place
let
there
be
truth
between
us
if
my
heart
seems
callous
and
indifferent
to
your
love
believe
me
it
is
warm
to
esteem
and
value
you
as
a
friend
i
might
almost
say
as
a
brother
for
in
sympathy
of
feeling
and
congeniality
of
disposition
you
are
nearer
to
me
than
my
own
brother
but
i
do
not
think
were
i
so
inclined
that
it
would
be
advisable
for
me
to
accept
your
hand
without
letting
you
know
something
of
my
past
history
i
told
you
a
few
moments
since
that
i
had
my
day
dream
permit
me
to
tell
you
for
i
think
you
are
entitled
to
my
confidence
the
object
of
that
day
dream
was
charles
romaine
charles
romaine
and
there
was
a
tone
of
wonder
in
the
voice
and
a
puzzled
look
on
the
face
of
paul
clifford
yes
charles
romaine
not
as
you
know
him
now
with
the
marks
of
dissipation
on
his
once
handsome
face
but
charles
romaine
as
i
knew
him
when
he
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
early
manhood
the
very
incarnation
of
beauty
strength
and
grace
not
charles
romaine
with
the
blurred
and
bloated
countenance
the
staggering
gait
the
confused
and
vacant
eye
but
charles
romaine
as
a
young
handsome
and
talented
lawyer
the
pride
of
our
village
the
hope
of
his
father
and
the
joy
of
his
mother
before
whom
the
future
was
opening
full
of
rich
and
rare
promises
need
i
tell
you
that
when
he
sought
my
hand
in
preference
to
all
the
other
girls
in
our
village
that
i
gave
him
what
i
never
can
give
to
another
the
first
deep
love
of
my
girlish
heart
for
nearly
a
whole
year
i
wore
his
betrothal
ring
upon
my
finger
when
i
saw
to
my
utter
anguish
and
dismay
that
he
was
fast
becoming
a
drunkard
oh
clifford
if
i
could
have
saved
him
i
would
have
taken
blood
from
every
vein
and
strength
from
every
nerve
we
met
frequently
at
entertainments
i
noticed
time
after
time
the
effects
of
the
wine
he
had
imbibed
upon
his
manner
and
conversation
at
first
i
shrank
from
remonstrating
with
him
until
the
burden
lay
so
heavy
on
my
heart
that
i
felt
i
must
speak
out
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
might
and
so
one
evening
i
told
him
plainly
and
seriously
my
fears
about
his
future
he
laughed
lightly
and
said
my
fears
were
unfounded
that
i
was
nervous
and
giving
away
to
idle
fancies
that
his
father
always
had
wine
at
the
table
and
that
he
had
never
seen
him
under
the
influence
of
liquor
silenced
but
not
convinced
i
watched
his
course
with
painful
solicitude
all
remonstrances
on
my
part
seemed
thrown
away
he
always
had
the
precedent
of
his
father
to
plead
in
reply
to
my
earnest
entreaties
at
last
when
remonstrances
and
entreaties
seemed
to
be
all
in
vain
i
resolved
to
break
the
engagement
it
may
have
been
a
harsh
and
hard
alternative
but
i
would
not
give
my
hand
where
my
respect
could
not
follow
it
may
be
that
i
thought
too
much
of
my
own
happiness
but
i
felt
that
marriage
must
be
for
me
positive
misery
or
positive
happiness
and
i
feared
that
if
i
married
a
man
so
lacking
in
as
to
become
a
common
drunkard
that
when
i
ceased
to
love
and
respect
him
i
should
be
constantly
tempted
to
hate
and
despise
him
i
think
one
of
the
saddest
fates
that
can
befall
a
woman
is
to
be
tied
for
life
to
a
miserable
bloated
wreck
of
humanity
there
may
be
some
women
with
broad
generous
hearts
and
great
charity
strong
enough
to
lift
such
men
out
of
the
depths
but
i
had
no
such
faith
in
my
strength
and
so
i
gave
him
back
his
ring
he
accepted
it
but
we
parted
as
friends
for
awhile
after
our
engagement
was
broken
we
occasionally
met
at
the
houses
of
our
mutual
friends
in
social
gatherings
and
i
noticed
with
intense
satisfaction
that
whenever
wine
was
offered
he
scrupulously
abstained
from
ever
tasting
a
drop
though
i
think
at
times
his
was
severely
tested
oh
what
hope
revived
in
my
heart
here
i
said
to
myself
is
compensation
for
all
i
have
suffered
if
by
it
he
shall
be
restored
to
manhood
usefulness
and
society
and
learn
to
make
his
life
not
a
thing
of
careless
ease
and
sensuous
indulgence
but
of
noble
struggle
and
high
and
holy
endeavor
but
while
i
was
picturing
out
for
him
a
magnificent
future
imagining
the
lofty
triumphs
of
his
intellect
an
intellect
grand
in
its
achievements
and
glorious
in
its
possibilities
my
beautiful
daydream
was
rudely
broken
up
and
vanished
away
like
the
rays
of
sunset
mingling
with
the
shadows
of
night
my
aunt
roland
celebrated
her
and
my
cousin
by
giving
a
large
entertainment
and
among
other
things
she
had
a
plentiful
supply
of
wine
romaine
had
lately
made
the
acquaintance
of
my
cousin
jeanette
roland
she
was
both
beautiful
in
person
and
fascinating
in
her
manners
and
thoughtlessly
she
held
a
glass
of
wine
in
her
hand
and
asked
romaine
if
he
would
not
honor
the
occasion
by
drinking
her
mother
health
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
his
cheek
paled
and
flushed
alternately
he
looked
irresolute
while
i
watched
him
in
silent
anguish
it
seemed
as
if
the
agony
of
years
was
compressed
in
a
few
moments
i
tried
to
catch
his
eye
but
failed
and
with
a
slight
tremor
in
his
hand
he
lifted
the
glass
to
his
lips
and
drank
i
do
not
think
i
would
have
felt
greater
anguish
had
i
seen
him
suddenly
drowned
in
sight
of
land
oh
clifford
that
night
comes
before
me
so
vividly
it
seems
as
if
i
am
living
it
all
over
again
i
do
not
think
romaine
has
ever
recovered
from
the
reawakening
of
his
appetite
he
has
since
married
jeanette
i
meet
her
occasionally
she
has
a
beautiful
home
dresses
magnificently
and
has
a
retinue
of
servants
and
yet
i
fancy
she
is
not
happy
that
somewhere
hidden
out
of
sight
there
is
a
worm
eating
at
the
core
of
her
life
she
has
a
way
of
dropping
her
eyes
and
an
absent
look
about
her
that
i
do
not
fully
understand
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
miss
the
old
elasticity
of
her
spirits
the
merry
ring
of
her
voice
the
pleasant
thrills
of
girlish
laughter
and
though
she
never
confesses
it
to
me
i
doubt
that
jeanette
is
happy
and
with
this
sad
experience
in
the
past
can
you
blame
me
if
i
am
slow
very
slow
to
let
the
broken
tendrils
of
my
heart
entwine
again
miss
belle
said
paul
clifford
catching
eagerly
at
the
smallest
straw
of
hope
if
you
can
not
give
me
the
first
love
of
a
fresh
young
life
i
am
content
with
the
rich
aftermath
of
your
maturer
years
and
ask
from
life
no
higher
prize
may
i
not
hope
for
that
i
will
think
on
it
but
for
the
present
let
us
change
the
subject
do
you
think
jeanette
is
happy
she
seems
so
different
from
what
she
used
to
be
said
miss
tabitha
jones
to
several
friends
who
were
spending
the
evening
with
her
happy
replied
mary
gladstone
do
see
what
to
hinder
her
from
being
happy
she
has
everything
that
heart
can
wish
i
was
down
to
her
house
yesterday
and
she
has
just
moved
in
her
new
home
it
has
all
the
modern
improvements
and
everything
is
in
excellent
taste
her
furniture
is
of
the
latest
style
and
i
think
it
is
really
superb
yes
said
her
sister
and
she
dresses
magnificently
last
week
she
showed
me
a
most
beautiful
set
of
jewelry
and
a
camel
hair
shawl
and
i
believe
it
is
real
camel
hair
i
think
you
could
almost
run
it
through
a
ring
if
i
had
all
she
has
i
think
i
should
be
as
happy
as
the
days
are
long
i
do
believe
i
would
let
a
wave
of
trouble
roll
across
my
peaceful
breast
oh
annette
said
gladstone
do
speak
so
extravagantly
and
i
do
like
to
hear
you
quote
those
lines
for
such
an
occasion
why
not
mother
where
the
harm
that
hymn
has
been
associated
in
my
mind
with
my
earliest
religious
impressions
and
experience
and
i
do
like
to
see
you
lift
it
out
of
its
sacred
associations
for
such
a
trifling
occasion
oh
mother
you
are
so
strict
i
shall
never
be
able
to
keep
time
with
you
but
i
do
think
if
i
was
off
as
jeanette
that
i
would
be
as
blithe
and
happy
as
a
lark
and
instead
of
that
she
seems
to
be
constantly
drooping
and
fading
annette
said
gladstone
i
knew
a
woman
who
possesses
more
than
jeanette
does
and
yet
she
died
of
starvation
died
of
starvation
why
when
and
where
did
that
happen
and
what
became
of
her
husband
he
is
in
society
caressed
and
ed
on
by
the
young
girls
of
his
set
and
i
have
seen
a
number
of
managing
mammas
to
whom
i
have
imagined
he
would
not
be
an
objectionable
do
i
know
him
mother
no
and
i
hope
you
never
will
well
mother
i
would
like
to
know
how
he
starved
his
wife
to
death
and
yet
escaped
the
law
the
law
helped
him
oh
mother
said
both
girls
opening
their
eyes
in
genuine
astonishment
i
thought
said
mary
gladstone
it
was
the
province
of
the
law
to
protect
women
i
was
just
telling
miss
basanquet
yesterday
when
she
was
talking
about
woman
suffrage
that
i
had
as
many
rights
as
i
wanted
and
that
i
was
willing
to
let
my
father
and
brothers
do
all
the
voting
for
me
forgetting
my
dear
that
there
are
millions
of
women
who
have
such
fathers
and
brothers
as
you
have
no
my
dear
when
you
examine
the
matter
a
little
more
closely
you
will
find
there
are
some
painful
inequalities
in
the
law
for
women
but
mother
i
do
think
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
for
women
to
vote
oh
just
think
of
women
being
hustled
and
crowded
at
the
polls
by
rude
men
their
breaths
reeking
with
whiskey
and
tobacco
the
very
air
heavy
with
their
oaths
and
then
they
have
the
polls
at
public
houses
oh
mother
i
never
want
to
see
the
day
when
women
vote
well
i
do
because
we
have
one
of
the
kindest
and
best
fathers
and
husbands
and
good
brothers
who
would
not
permit
the
winds
of
heaven
to
visit
us
too
roughly
there
is
no
reason
we
should
throw
ourselves
between
the
sunshine
and
our
less
fortunate
sisters
who
shiver
in
the
blast
but
mother
i
do
see
how
voting
would
help
us
i
am
sure
we
have
influence
i
have
often
heard
papa
say
that
you
were
the
first
to
awaken
him
to
a
sense
of
the
enormity
of
slavery
now
mother
if
we
women
would
use
our
influence
with
our
fathers
brothers
husbands
and
sons
could
we
not
have
everything
we
want
no
my
dear
we
could
not
with
all
our
influence
we
never
could
have
the
same
sense
of
responsibility
which
flows
from
the
possession
of
power
i
want
women
to
possess
power
as
well
as
influence
i
want
every
christian
woman
as
she
passes
by
a
grogshop
or
liquor
saloon
to
feel
that
she
has
on
her
heart
a
burden
of
responsibility
for
its
existence
i
hold
my
dear
that
a
nation
as
well
as
an
individual
should
have
a
conscience
and
on
this
liquor
question
there
is
room
for
conscience
not
merely
as
a
persuasive
influence
but
as
an
enlightened
and
aggressive
power
well
ma
i
think
you
would
make
a
first
class
stump
speaker
i
expect
when
women
vote
we
shall
be
constantly
having
calls
for
the
gifted
and
talented
gladstone
to
speak
on
the
duties
and
perils
of
the
hour
and
i
would
do
it
i
would
go
among
my
sister
women
and
try
to
persuade
them
to
use
their
vote
as
a
moral
lever
not
to
make
home
less
happy
but
society
more
holy
i
would
have
good
and
sensible
women
grave
in
manner
and
cultured
in
intellect
attend
the
primary
meetings
and
bring
their
moral
influence
and
political
power
to
frown
down
corruption
chicanery
and
low
cunning
but
mother
just
think
if
women
went
to
the
polls
how
many
vicious
ones
would
go
i
hope
and
believe
for
the
honor
of
our
sex
that
the
vicious
women
of
the
community
are
never
in
the
majority
that
for
one
woman
whose
feet
turn
aside
from
the
paths
of
rectitude
that
there
are
thousands
of
feet
that
never
stray
into
forbidden
paths
and
today
i
believe
there
is
virtue
enough
in
society
to
confront
its
vice
and
intelligence
enough
to
grapple
with
its
ignorance
chapter
xviii
why
gladstone
said
miss
tabitha
you
are
as
zealous
as
a
new
convert
to
the
cause
of
woman
suffrage
we
single
women
who
are
constantly
taxed
without
being
represented
know
what
it
is
to
see
ignorance
and
corruption
striking
hands
together
and
voting
away
our
money
for
whatever
purposes
they
choose
i
pay
as
large
a
tax
as
many
of
the
men
in
and
yet
can
not
say
who
shall
assess
my
property
for
a
single
year
and
there
is
another
thing
said
gladstone
ought
to
be
brought
to
the
consideration
of
the
men
and
it
is
this
they
refuse
to
let
us
vote
and
yet
fail
to
protect
our
homes
from
the
ravages
of
rum
my
young
friend
whom
i
said
died
of
starvation
foolishly
married
a
dissipated
man
who
happened
to
be
rich
and
handsome
she
was
gentle
loving
sensitive
to
a
fault
he
was
querulous
and
irritable
because
his
nervous
system
was
constantly
unstrung
by
liquor
she
lacked
tenderness
sympathy
and
heart
support
and
at
last
faded
and
died
not
starvation
of
the
body
but
a
trophy
of
the
soul
and
when
i
say
the
law
helped
i
mean
it
licensed
the
places
that
kept
the
temptation
ever
in
his
way
and
i
fear
that
is
the
secret
of
faded
looks
and
unhappy
bearing
no
jeanette
was
not
happy
night
after
night
would
she
pace
the
floor
of
her
splendidly
furnished
chamber
waiting
and
watching
for
her
footsteps
she
and
his
friends
had
hoped
that
her
influence
would
be
strong
enough
to
win
him
away
from
his
boon
companions
that
his
home
and
beautiful
bride
would
present
superior
attractions
to
saloon
his
gambling
pool
and
champaign
suppers
and
for
a
while
they
did
but
soon
the
novelty
wore
off
and
jeanette
found
out
to
her
great
grief
that
her
power
to
bind
him
to
the
simple
attractions
of
home
were
as
futile
as
a
role
of
cobwebs
to
moor
a
ship
to
the
shore
when
it
has
drifted
out
and
is
dashing
among
the
breakers
he
had
learned
to
live
an
element
of
excitement
and
to
depend
upon
artificial
stimulation
until
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
blood
in
his
veins
grew
sluggish
fictitious
excitement
was
removed
his
father
hopeless
of
his
future
had
dissolved
partnership
with
him
and
for
months
there
had
been
no
communication
between
them
and
jeanette
saw
with
agony
and
dismay
that
his
life
was
being
wrecked
upon
the
broad
sea
of
sin
and
shame
where
is
his
father
the
child
ca
live
it
is
one
of
the
worst
cases
of
croup
i
have
had
this
year
why
did
you
send
for
me
sooner
where
is
his
father
it
is
now
just
twelve
time
for
all
respectable
men
to
be
in
the
house
said
the
bluff
but
kind
hearted
family
doctor
looking
tenderly
upon
jeanette
little
boy
who
lay
gasping
for
breath
in
the
last
stages
of
croup
oh
i
do
know
said
jeanette
her
face
crimsoning
beneath
the
doctor
searching
glance
i
suppose
he
is
down
to
anderson
anderson
said
the
doctor
in
a
tone
of
hearty
indignation
what
business
has
he
there
and
his
child
dying
here
but
doctor
he
did
know
the
child
had
fever
when
he
went
out
but
neither
of
us
thought
much
of
it
till
i
was
awakened
by
his
strange
and
unnatural
breathing
i
sent
for
you
as
soon
as
i
could
rouse
the
servants
well
rouse
them
again
and
tell
them
to
go
down
to
anderson
and
tell
your
husband
that
his
child
is
dying
oh
no
not
dying
doctor
you
surely
do
mean
it
yes
jeanette
said
the
old
family
doctor
tenderly
and
sadly
i
can
do
nothing
for
him
let
me
take
him
in
my
arms
and
rest
you
dear
little
darling
he
will
be
saved
from
the
evils
to
come
just
as
his
life
was
trembling
on
its
frailest
chords
and
its
delicate
machinery
almost
wound
up
charles
romaine
returned
sober
enough
to
take
in
the
situation
he
strode
up
to
the
dying
child
took
the
clammy
hands
in
his
and
said
in
a
tone
of
bitter
anguish
charlie
do
you
know
papa
would
you
speak
one
little
word
to
papa
but
it
was
too
late
the
shadows
that
never
deceive
flitted
over
the
pale
beauty
of
the
marble
brow
the
waxen
lid
closed
over
the
once
bright
and
laughing
eye
and
the
cold
grave
for
its
rest
had
won
the

if
riches
could
bring
happiness
john
anderson
should
be
a
happy
man
and
yet
he
is
far
from
being
happy
he
has
succeeded
in
making
money
but
failed
in
every
thing
else
but
let
us
enter
his
home
as
you
open
the
parlor
door
your
feet
sink
in
the
rich
and
beautiful
carpet
exquisite
statuary
and
superbly
framed
pictures
greet
your
eye
and
you
are
ready
to
exclaim
oh
how
lovely
here
are
the
beautiful
conceptions
of
painters
art
and
sculptors
skill
it
is
a
home
of
wealth
luxury
and
display
but
not
of
love
refinement
and
culture
years
since
before
john
anderson
came
to
live
in
the
city
of
he
had
formed
an
attachment
for
an
excellent
young
lady
who
taught
school
in
his
native
village
and
they
were
engaged
to
be
married
but
after
coming
to
the
city
and
forming
new
associations
visions
of
wealth
dazzled
his
brain
and
unsettled
his
mind
till
the
idea
of
love
in
a
cottage
grew
distasteful
to
him
he
had
seen
men
with
no
more
ability
than
himself
who
had
come
to
the
city
almost
pennyless
and
who
had
grown
rich
in
a
few
years
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
possible
he
would
do
two
things
acquire
wealth
and
live
an
easy
life
and
he
thought
the
easiest
way
to
accomplish
both
ends
was
to
open
up
a
gorgeous
palace
of
sin
and
entice
into
his
meshes
the
unwary
the
inexperienced
and
the
misguided
slaves
of
appetite
for
awhile
after
he
left
his
native
village
he
wrote
almost
constantly
to
his
betrothed
but
as
new
objects
and
interests
engaged
his
attention
his
letters
became
colder
and
less
frequent
until
they
finally
ceased
and
the
engagement
was
broken
at
first
the
blow
fell
heavily
upon
the
heart
of
his
affianced
but
she
was
too
sensible
to
fade
away
and
die
the
victim
of
unrequited
love
and
in
after
years
when
she
had
thrown
her
whole
soul
into
the
temperance
cause
and
consecrated
her
life
to
the
work
of
uplifting
fallen
humanity
she
learned
to
be
thankful
that
it
was
not
her
lot
to
be
united
to
a
man
who
stood
as
a
barrier
across
the
path
of
human
progress
and
would
have
been
a
weight
to
her
instead
of
wings
released
from
his
engagement
he
entered
into
an
alliance
for
that
is
the
better
name
for
a
marriage
which
was
not
a
union
of
hearts
or
intercommunion
of
kindred
souls
but
only
an
affair
of
convenience
in
a
word
he
married
for
money
a
woman
who
was
no
longer
young
in
years
nor
beautiful
in
person
nor
amiable
in
temper
but
she
was
rich
and
her
money
like
charity
covered
a
multitude
of
faults
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
golden
bait
he
caught
at
it
and
they
were
married
for
he
was
willing
to
do
almost
any
thing
for
money
except
work
hard
for
it
it
was
a
marriage
however
that
brought
no
happiness
to
either
party
anderson
was
an
illy
educated
self
willed
narrow
minded
woman
full
of
airs
and
pretensions
the
only
daughter
of
a
man
who
had
laid
the
foundation
of
his
wealth
by
keeping
a
low
groggery
and
dying
had
left
her
his
only
heir
john
anderson
was
selfish
and
grasping
he
loved
money
and
she
loved
display
and
their
home
was
often
the
scene
of
the
most
pitiful
contentions
about
money
matters
harsh
words
and
bitter
recriminations
were
almost
common
household
usages
the
children
brought
up
in
this
unhealthy
atmosphere
naturally
took
sides
with
their
mother
and
their
home
was
literally
a
house
divided
against
itself
the
foolish
conduct
of
the
mother
inspired
the
children
with
disrespect
for
their
father
who
failed
to
support
the
authority
of
his
wife
as
the
mother
and
mistress
of
the
home
as
her
sons
grew
older
they
often
sought
attractions
in
questionable
places
away
from
the
sombre
influences
of
their
fireside
and
the
daughters
as
soon
as
they
stood
upon
the
verge
of
early
womanhood
learned
to
look
upon
marriage
as
an
escape
valve
from
domestic
discomforts
and
in
that
beautiful
home
with
all
its
costly
surroundings
and
sumptuous
furniture
there
was
always
something
wanting
there
was
always
a
lack
of
tenderness
sympathy
and
mutual
esteem
i
ca
afford
it
said
john
anderson
to
his
wife
who
had
been
asking
for
money
for
a
trip
to
a
fashionable
watering
place
you
will
have
to
spend
the
summer
elsewhere
ca
afford
it
what
nonsense
is
not
it
as
much
to
your
interest
as
mine
to
carry
the
girls
around
and
give
them
a
chance
a
chance
for
what
why
to
see
something
of
the
world
you
do
know
what
may
happen
that
english
earl
was
very
attentive
last
night
to
sophronia
at
ball
an
english
count
who
is
he
and
where
did
he
spring
from
why
he
from
england
and
is
said
to
be
the
only
son
and
heir
of
a
very
rich
nobleman
i
do
believe
it
i
do
believe
he
is
an
earl
any
more
than
i
am
that
just
like
you
always
throw
cold
water
on
every
thing
i
say
it
is
no
such
thing
but
i
do
believe
in
picking
up
strangers
and
putting
them
into
my
bosom
it
is
not
all
gold
that
glitters
i
know
that
but
how
soon
can
you
let
me
have
some
money
i
want
to
go
out
this
afternoon
and
do
some
shopping
and
engage
the
semptress
i
tell
you
annette
i
have
not
the
money
to
spare
the
money
market
is
very
tight
and
i
have
very
heavy
bills
to
meet
this
month
the
money
market
tight
why
it
has
been
tight
ever
since
i
have
been
married
well
you
may
believe
it
or
not
just
as
you
choose
but
i
tell
you
this
crusading
has
made
quite
a
hole
in
my
business
now
john
anderson
tell
that
to
somebody
that
do
know
i
believe
this
crusading
has
laid
a
finger
weight
upon
your
business
yes
it
has
and
if
you
read
the
papers
you
would
find
that
it
has
even
affected
the
revenue
of
the
state
and
you
will
have
to
retrench
somewhere
well
i
retrench
somewhere
i
think
we
are
paying
our
servants
too
high
wages
any
how
shenflint
gets
twice
as
much
work
done
for
the
same
money
i
retrench
john
anderson
but
i
want
you
to
remember
that
i
did
not
marry
you
empty
handed
i
do
think
i
shall
be
apt
to
forget
it
in
a
hurry
while
i
have
such
a
gentle
reminder
at
hand
he
replied
sarcastically
and
i
suppose
you
would
not
have
married
me
if
i
had
had
no
money
no
i
would
not
said
john
anderson
thoroughly
exasperated
and
i
would
have
been
a
fool
if
i
had
these
bitter
words
spoken
in
a
heat
of
passion
were
calculated
to
work
disastrously
in
that
sin
darkened
home
for
some
time
she
had
been
suspecting
that
her
money
had
been
the
chief
inducement
which
led
him
to
seek
her
hand
and
now
her
worse
suspicions
were
confirmed
and
the
last
thread
of
confidence
was
severed
i
should
not
have
said
it
said
anderson
to
himself
but
the
woman
is
so
provoking
and
unreasonable
i
suppose
she
will
have
a
fit
of
sulks
for
a
month
and
never
be
done
brooding
over
those
foolish
words
and
anderson
sighed
as
if
he
were
an
ill
used
man
he
had
married
for
money
and
he
had
got
what
he
bargained
for
love
confidence
and
mutual
esteem
were
not
sought
in
the
contract
and
these
do
not
necessarily
come
of
themselves
well
the
best
i
can
do
is
to
give
her
what
money
she
wants
and
be
done
with
it
is
not
in
her
room
no
sir
and
her
bed
has
not
been
rumpled
where
in
the
world
can
she
be
i
do
know
but
here
is
a
note
she
left
what
does
she
say
read
it
annette
she
says
she
feels
that
you
were
unjust
to
the
earl
and
that
she
hopes
you
will
forgive
her
the
steps
she
has
taken
but
by
the
time
the
letter
reaches
you
she
expects
to
be
the
countess
of
clarendon
poor
foolish
girl
you
see
what
comes
of
taking
a
stranger
to
your
bosom
and
making
so
much
of
him
that
just
like
you
john
anderson
every
thing
that
goes
wrong
is
blamed
on
me
i
almost
wish
i
was
dead
i
wish
so
too
thought
anderson
but
he
concluded
it
was
prudent
to
keep
the
wish
to
himself
john
anderson
had
no
faith
whatever
in
the
pretensions
of
his
new
but
his
vain
and
foolish
wife
on
the
other
hand
was
elated
at
the
dazzling
prospects
of
her
daughter
and
often
in
her
imagination
visited
the
palatial
residence
of
my
son
the
earl
and
was
graciously
received
in
society
as
the
mother
of
the
countess
of
clarendon
she
was
also
highly
gratified
at
the
supposed
effect
of
sophronia
marriage
upon
a
certain
clique
who
had
been
too
exclusive
to
admit
her
in
their
set
should
not
those
gladstone
girls
be
ready
to
snag
themselves
and
there
was
that
mary
talbot
did
every
thing
she
could
to
attract
his
attention
but
it
was
no
go
my
little
sophronia
came
along
and
took
the
rag
off
the
bush
i
guess
they
will
almost
die
with
envy
if
he
had
waited
for
her
father
consent
we
might
have
waited
till
the
end
of
the
chapter
but
i
took
the
responsibility
on
my
shoulders
and
the
thing
is
done
my
daughter
the
countess
of
clarendon
i
like
the
ring
of
the
words
but
dear
me
here
the
morning
mail
and
a
letter
from
the
countess
but
what
does
it
mean
come
to
me
i
am
in
great
trouble
in
quick
response
to
the
appeal
anderson
took
the
first
train
to
new
york
and
found
her
daughter
in
great
distress
the
earl
had
been
arrested
for
forgery
and
stealing
and
darker
suspicions
were
hinted
against
him
he
had
been
a
body
servant
to
a
nobleman
who
had
been
travelling
for
his
health
and
who
had
died
by
a
lonely
farmhouse
where
he
had
gone
for
fresh
air
and
quiet
and
his
servant
had
seized
upon
his
effects
and
letters
of
introduction
and
passed
himself
off
as
the
original
earl
and
imitating
his
handwriting
had
obtained
large
remittances
for
which
he
was
arrested
tried
and
sent
to
prison
and
thus
ended
the
enchanting
dream
of
my
daughter
the
countess
of
clarendon
chapter
xxi
i
can
not
ensure
your
life
a
single
hour
unless
you
quit
business
you
are
liable
to
be
stricken
with
paralysis
at
any
moment
if
once
subject
to
the
least
excitement
ca
you
trust
your
business
in
the
hands
of
your
sons
doctor
said
john
anderson
i
have
only
two
boys
my
oldest
went
west
several
years
ago
and
never
writes
to
us
unless
he
wants
something
and
as
to
frank
if
i
would
put
the
concern
into
his
hands
he
would
drink
himself
into
the
grave
in
less
than
a
month
the
whole
fact
is
this
my
children
are
the
curse
of
my
life
and
there
was
bitterness
in
the
tone
of
john
anderson
as
he
uttered
these
words
of
fearful
sorrow
well
said
the
doctor
you
must
have
rest
and
quiet
or
i
will
not
answer
for
the
consequences
rest
and
quiet
said
john
anderson
to
himself
i
do
see
how
i
am
to
get
it
with
such
a
wife
as
i
have
always
worrying
and
bothering
me
about
something
anderson
said
one
of
the
servants
anderson
says
please
come
as
quick
as
possible
into
frank
room
what
the
matter
now
i
do
know
but
frank
acting
mightily
queer
he
thinks
there
are
snakes
and
lizards
crawling
over
him
he
got
the
horrors
just
what
i
expected
tell
me
about
rest
and
quiet
i
be
there
in
a
minute
oh
what
the
matter
i
feel
strange
said
anderson
falling
back
on
the
bed
suddenly
stricken
with
paralysis
while
in
another
room
lay
his
younger
son
a
victim
to
delirium
tremens
and
dying
in
fearful
agony
the
curse
that
john
anderson
had
sent
to
other
homes
had
come
back
darkened
with
the
shadow
of
death
to
brood
over
his
own
habitation
his
son
is
dying
but
he
has
no
word
of
hope
to
cheer
the
parting
spirit
as
it
passed
out
into
the
eternity
for
him
the
darkness
of
the
tomb
is
not
gilded
with
the
glory
of
the
resurrection
the
best
medical
skill
has
been
summoned
to
the
aid
of
john
anderson
but
neither
art
nor
skill
can
bind
anew
the
broken
threads
of
life
the
chamber
in
which
he
is
confined
is
a
marvel
of
decoration
light
streams
into
his
home
through
panes
of
beautifully
stained
glass
pillows
of
the
softest
down
are
placed
beneath
his
head
beautiful
cushions
lie
at
his
feet
that
will
never
take
another
step
on
the
errands
of
sin
but
no
appliances
of
wealth
can
give
peace
to
his
guilty
conscience
he
looks
back
upon
the
past
and
the
retrospect
is
a
worse
than
wasted
life
and
when
the
future
looms
up
before
him
he
shrinks
back
from
the
contemplation
for
the
sins
of
the
past
throw
their
shadow
over
the
future
he
has
houses
money
and
land
but
he
is
a
pauper
in
his
soul
and
a
bankrupt
in
his
character
in
his
eager
selfish
grasp
for
gold
he
has
shriveled
his
intellect
and
hardened
and
dried
up
his
heart
and
in
so
doing
he
has
cut
himself
off
from
the
richest
sources
of
human
enjoyment
he
has
wasted
life
best
opportunities
and
there
never
was
an
angel
however
bright
terrible
and
strong
that
ever
had
power
to
roll
away
the
stone
from
the
grave
of
a
dead
opportunity
and
what
john
anderson
has
lost
in
time
he
can
never
make
up
in
eternity
he
has
formed
no
taste
for
reading
and
thus
has
cut
himself
off
from
the
glorious
companionship
of
the
good
the
great
and
the
wise
of
all
ages
he
has
been
selfish
mean
and
grasping
and
the
blessing
of
the
poor
and
needy
never
fall
as
benedictions
on
his
weary
head
and
in
that
beautiful
home
with
disease
and
death
clutching
at
his
heartstrings
he
has
wealth
that
he
can
not
enjoy
luxuries
that
pall
upon
his
taste
and
magnificence
that
can
never
satisfy
the
restless
craving
of
his
soul
his
life
has
been
a
wretched
failure
he
neglected
his
children
to
amass
the
ways
of
iniquity
and
their
coldness
and
indifference
pierce
him
like
poisoned
arrows
marriage
has
brought
him
money
but
not
the
sweet
tender
ministrations
of
loving
wifely
care
and
so
he
lives
on
starving
in
the
midst
of
plenty
dying
of
thirst
with
life
sweetest
fountains
eluding
his
grasp
charles
romaine
is
sleeping
in
a
drunkard
grave
after
the
death
of
his
boy
there
was
a
decided
change
in
him
night
after
night
he
tore
himself
away
from
john
anderson
saloon
and
struggled
with
the
monster
that
had
enslaved
him
and
for
awhile
victory
seemed
to
be
perching
on
the
banner
of
his
resolution
another
child
took
the
place
of
the
first
born
and
the
dead
and
hope
and
joy
began
to
blossom
around
path
his
mother
who
had
never
ceased
to
visit
the
house
marked
the
change
with
great
satisfaction
and
prevailed
upon
his
father
to
invite
charles
and
jeanette
to
a
new
year
dinner
only
a
family
gathering
jeanette
being
unwell
excused
herself
from
going
and
charles
went
alone
jeanette
felt
a
fearful
foreboding
when
she
saw
him
leaving
the
door
and
said
to
herself
i
hope
his
father
will
not
offer
him
wine
i
am
so
afraid
that
something
will
happen
to
him
and
yet
i
hated
to
persuade
him
not
to
go
his
mother
might
think
i
was
averse
to
his
reconciliation
with
his
father
it
looks
very
natural
to
have
charles
with
us
again
said
ro
maine
looking
fondly
on
her
son
yes
it
seems
like
old
times
when
i
always
had
my
seat
next
to
yours
and
i
hope
said
his
father
it
will
never
be
vacant
so
long
again
the
dinner
hour
passed
on
enlivened
by
social
chat
and
pleasant
reminiscences
and
there
was
nothing
to
mar
the
harmony
of
the
occasion
romaine
had
been
careful
to
keep
everything
from
the
table
that
would
be
apt
to
awaken
the
old
appetite
for
liquor
but
after
dinner
romaine
invited
charles
into
the
library
to
smoke
here
said
he
handing
him
a
cigar
is
one
of
the
finest
brands
i
have
smoked
lately
and
by
the
way
here
is
some
rare
old
wine
more
than
years
old
which
was
sent
to
me
yesterday
by
an
old
friend
and
college
class
mate
of
mine
let
me
pour
you
out
a
glass
charles
suddenly
became
agitated
but
as
his
father
back
was
turned
to
him
pouring
out
the
wine
he
did
not
notice
the
sudden
paling
of
his
cheek
and
the
hesitation
of
his
manner
and
charles
checking
back
his
scruples
took
the
glass
and
drained
it
to
the
bottom
there
is
a
fable
that
a
certain
king
once
permitted
the
devil
to
kiss
his
shoulder
and
out
of
those
shoulders
sprang
two
serpents
that
in
the
fury
of
their
hunger
aimed
at
his
head
and
tried
to
get
at
his
brain
he
tried
to
extricate
himself
from
their
terrible
power
he
tore
at
them
with
his
fingers
and
found
that
it
was
his
own
flesh
that
he
was
lacerating
dormant
but
not
dead
was
the
appetite
for
strong
drink
in
charles
romaine
and
that
one
glass
awakened
the
serpent
coiled
up
in
his
flesh
he
went
out
from
his
father
house
with
a
newly
awakened
appetite
clamoring
and
raging
for
strong
drink
every
saloon
he
passed
adding
intensity
to
his
craving
at
last
his
appetite
overmastered
him
and
he
almost
rushed
into
a
saloon
and
waited
impatiently
till
he
was
served
every
nerve
seemed
to
be
quivering
with
excitement
restlessness
and
there
was
a
look
of
wild
despairing
anguish
on
his
face
as
he
clutched
the
glass
to
allay
the
terrible
craving
of
his
system
he
drank
till
his
head
was
giddy
and
his
gait
was
staggering
and
then
started
for
home
he
entered
the
gate
and
slipped
on
the
ice
and
being
too
intoxicated
to
rise
or
comprehend
his
situation
he
lay
helpless
in
the
dark
and
cold
until
there
crept
over
him
that
sleep
from
which
there
is
no
awakening
and
when
morning
had
broken
in
all
its
glory
charles
romaine
had
drifted
out
of
life
slain
by
the
wine
which
at
last
had
bitten
like
an
adder
and
stung
like
a
serpent
jeanette
had
waited
and
watched
through
the
small
hours
of
the
night
till
nature
had
sought
repose
in
sleep
and
rising
very
early
in
the
morning
she
had
gone
to
the
front
door
to
look
down
the
street
for
his
coming
when
the
first
object
that
met
her
gaze
was
the
lifeless
form
of
her
husband
one
wild
and
bitter
shriek
rent
the
air
and
she
fell
fainting
on
the
frozen
corpse
her
friends
gathered
round
her
all
that
love
and
tenderness
could
do
was
done
for
the
wretched
wife
but
nothing
could
erase
from
her
mind
one
agonizing
sorrow
it
was
the
memory
of
her
fatal
triumph
over
his
good
resolution
years
ago
at
her
mother
silver
wedding
carelessly
she
had
sowed
the
seeds
of
transgression
whose
fearful
yield
was
a
harvest
of
bitter
misery
clifford
came
to
her
in
her
hour
of
trial
and
tried
to
comfort
and
sustain
the
woman
who
had
tried
to
take
life
easy
but
found
it
terribly
hard
and
she
has
measurably
succeeded
in
the
home
of
her
cousin
she
is
trying
to
bear
the
burden
of
her
life
as
well
as
she
can
her
eye
never
lights
up
with
joy
the
bloom
and
flush
have
left
her
careworn
face
tears
from
her
eyes
long
used
to
weeping
have
blenched
the
coloring
of
her
life
existence
and
she
is
passing
through
life
with
the
shadow
of
the
grave
upon
her
desolate
heart
joe
gough
has
been
true
to
his
pledge
plenty
and
comfort
have
taken
the
place
of
poverty
and
pain
he
continued
his
membership
with
the
church
of
his
choice
and
mary
is
also
striving
to
live
a
new
life
and
to
be
the
ministering
angel
that
keeps
his
steps
and
he
feels
that
in
answer
to
prayer
his
appetite
for
strong
drink
has
been
taken
away
life
with
clifford
has
become
a
thing
of
brightness
and
beauty
and
when
children
sprang
up
in
her
path
making
gladness
and
sunshine
around
her
home
she
was
a
wife
and
tender
mother
fond
but
not
foolish
firm
in
her
household
government
but
not
stern
and
unsympathising
in
her
manner
the
faithful
friend
and
companion
of
her
daughters
she
won
their
confidence
by
her
loving
care
and
tender
caution
she
taught
them
to
come
to
her
in
their
hours
of
perplexity
and
trial
and
to
keep
no
secrets
from
her
sympathising
heart
she
taught
her
sons
to
be
as
upright
in
their
lives
and
as
pure
in
their
conversation
as
she
would
have
her
daughters
recognizing
for
each
only
one
code
of
morals
and
one
law
of
spiritual
life
and
in
course
of
time
she
saw
her
daughters
ripening
into
such
a
beautiful
womanhood
and
her
sons
entering
the
arena
of
life
not
with
the
simplicity
which
is
ignorant
of
danger
and
evil
but
with
the
sterling
integrity
which
baffles
the
darts
of
temptation
with
the
panoply
of
principle
and
the
armor
of
uprightness
unconsciously
she
elevated
the
tone
of
society
in
which
she
moved
by
a
life
which
was
a
beautiful
and
earnest
expression
of
patient
continuance
in
well
doing
paul
clifford
life
has
been
a
grand
success
not
in
the
mere
accumulation
of
wealth
but
in
the
enrichment
of
his
moral
and
spiritual
nature
he
is
still
ever
ready
to
lend
a
helping
hand
he
has
not
lived
merely
for
wealth
and
enjoyment
but
happiness
lasting
