homeward
bound
hatchard
conversation
for
nearly
a
week
had
been
confined
to
finding
and
grunts
a
system
of
treatment
designed
to
wean
hatchard
from
her
besetting
sin
of
extravagance
on
other
occasions
the
treatment
had
for
short
periods
proved
successful
but
it
was
quite
evident
that
his
wife
constitution
was
becoming
inured
to
this
physic
and
required
a
change
of
treatment
the
evidence
stared
at
him
from
the
mantelpiece
in
the
shape
of
a
pair
of
huge
pink
vases
which
had
certainly
not
been
there
when
he
left
in
the
morning
he
looked
at
them
and
breathed
heavily
pretty
ai
they
said
his
wife
nodding
at
them
who
gave
to
you
inquired
hatchard
sternly
his
wife
shook
her
head
you
do
get
vases
like
that
given
to
you
she
said
slowly
leastways
i
do
do
you
mean
to
say
you
bought
demanded
her
husband
hatchard
nodded
after
all
i
said
to
you
about
wasting
my
money
persisted
hatchard
in
amazed
accents
hatchard
nodded
more
brightly
than
before
there
has
got
to
be
an
end
to
this
said
her
husband
desperately
i
wo
have
it
d
hear
i
wo
have
it
i
bought
with
my
own
money
said
his
wife
tossing
her
head
your
money
said
hatchard
to
hear
you
talk
anybody
think
you
got
three
hundred
a
year
instead
o
thirty
your
money
ought
to
be
spent
in
useful
things
same
as
what
mine
is
why
should
i
spend
my
money
keeping
you
while
you
waste
yours
on
pink
vases
and
having
friends
in
to
tea
hatchard
still
comely
face
took
on
a
deeper
tinge
keeping
me
she
said
sharply
you
better
stop
before
you
say
anything
you
might
be
sorry
for
alfred
i
should
have
to
talk
a
long
time
before
i
said
that
retorted
the
other
i
not
so
sure
said
his
wife
i
beginning
to
be
tired
of
it
i
reasoned
with
you
continued
hatchard
i
argued
with
you
and
i
pointed
out
the
error
of
your
ways
to
you
and
it
all
no
good
oh
be
quiet
and
do
talk
nonsense
said
his
wife
talking
continued
hatchard
as
i
said
before
is
no
good
deeds
not
words
is
what
is
wanted
he
rose
suddenly
from
his
chair
and
taking
one
of
the
vases
from
the
mantelpiece
dashed
it
to
pieces
on
the
fender
example
is
contagious
and
two
seconds
later
he
was
in
his
chair
again
softly
feeling
a
rapidly
growing
bump
on
his
head
and
gazing
at
his
wife
illustration
taking
one
of
the
vases
from
the
mantelpiece
he
dashed
it
to
pieces
on
the
fender
and
i
do
it
again
said
that
lady
breathlessly
if
there
was
another
vase
hatchard
opened
his
mouth
but
speech
failed
him
he
got
up
and
left
the
room
without
a
word
and
making
his
way
to
the
scullery
turned
on
the
tap
and
held
his
head
beneath
it
a
sharp
intake
of
the
breath
announced
that
a
tributary
stream
was
looking
for
the
bump
down
the
neck
of
his
shirt
he
was
away
a
long
time
so
long
that
the
hatchard
was
beginning
to
think
of
giving
first
aid
to
the
wounded
then
she
heard
him
coming
slowly
back
along
the
passage
he
entered
the
room
drying
his
wet
hair
on
a
i
i
hope
i
did
hurt
you
much
said
his
wife
hatchard
drew
himself
up
and
regarded
her
with
lofty
indignation
you
might
have
killed
me
he
said
at
last
in
thrilling
tones
then
what
would
you
have
done
swept
up
the
pieces
and
said
you
came
home
injured
and
died
in
my
arms
said
hatchard
glibly
i
do
want
to
be
unfeeling
but
you
try
the
temper
of
a
saint
i
sure
i
wonder
i
have
done
it
before
why
i
married
a
stingy
man
i
do
know
why
i
married
at
all
i
do
know
said
her
husband
in
a
deep
voice
we
were
both
fools
said
hatchard
in
a
resigned
voice
what
it
was
however
it
ca
be
helped
now
some
men
would
go
and
leave
you
said
hatchard
well
go
said
his
wife
bridling
i
do
want
you
do
talk
nonsense
said
the
other
it
ai
nonsense
said
hatchard
if
you
want
to
go
go
i
do
want
to
keep
you
i
only
wish
i
could
said
her
husband
wistfully
there
the
door
said
hatchard
pointing
what
to
prevent
you
and
have
you
going
to
the
magistrate
observed
hatchard
not
me
was
the
reply
or
coming
up
full
of
complaints
to
the
not
me
said
his
wife
again
it
makes
my
mouth
water
to
think
of
it
said
hatchard
four
years
ago
i
had
a
care
in
the
world
me
neither
said
hatchard
but
then
i
never
thought
i
should
marry
you
i
remember
the
first
time
i
saw
you
i
had
to
stuff
my
handkerchief
in
my
mouth
what
for
inquired
hatchard
keep
from
laughing
was
the
reply
you
took
care
not
to
let
me
see
you
laugh
said
hatchard
grimly
you
were
polite
enough
in
them
days
i
only
wish
i
could
have
my
time
over
again
that
all
you
can
go
as
i
said
before
said
his
wife
i
go
this
minute
said
hatchard
but
i
know
what
it
be
in
three
or
four
days
you
be
coming
and
begging
me
to
take
you
back
again
you
try
me
said
hatchard
with
a
hard
laugh
i
can
keep
myself
you
leave
me
the
furniture
most
of
it
is
mine
and
i
worry
you
again
mind
said
hatchard
raising
his
hand
with
great
solemnity
if
i
go
i
never
come
back
again
i
take
care
of
that
said
his
wife
equably
you
are
far
more
likely
to
ask
to
come
back
than
i
am
hatchard
stood
for
some
time
in
deep
thought
and
then
spurred
on
by
a
short
contemptuous
laugh
from
his
wife
went
to
the
small
passage
and
putting
on
his
overcoat
and
hat
stood
in
the
parlor
doorway
regarding
her
i
a
good
mind
to
take
you
at
your
word
he
said
at
last
said
his
wife
briskly
if
you
send
me
your
address
send
your
things
on
to
you
there
no
need
for
you
to
call
about
them
hardly
realizing
the
seriousness
of
the
step
hatchard
closed
the
front
door
behind
him
with
a
bang
and
then
discovered
that
it
was
raining
too
proud
to
return
for
his
umbrella
he
turned
up
his
and
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
walked
slowly
down
the
desolate
little
street
by
the
time
he
had
walked
a
dozen
yards
he
began
to
think
that
he
might
as
well
have
waited
until
the
morning
before
he
had
walked
fifty
he
was
certain
of
it
he
passed
the
night
at
a
and
rose
so
early
in
the
morning
that
the
proprietor
took
it
as
a
personal
affront
and
advised
him
to
get
his
breakfast
elsewhere
it
was
the
longest
day
in
experience
and
securing
modest
lodgings
that
evening
he
overslept
himself
and
was
late
at
the
warehouse
next
morning
for
the
first
time
in
ten
years
his
personal
effects
arrived
next
day
but
no
letter
came
from
his
wife
and
one
which
he
wrote
concerning
a
pair
of
missing
garments
received
no
reply
he
wrote
again
referring
to
them
in
laudatory
terms
and
got
a
brief
reply
to
the
effect
that
they
had
been
exchanged
in
part
payment
on
a
pair
of
valuable
pink
vases
the
pieces
of
which
he
could
have
by
paying
the
carriage
in
six
weeks
hatchard
changed
his
lodgings
twice
a
lack
of
those
home
comforts
which
he
had
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
during
his
married
life
was
a
source
of
much
tribulation
and
it
was
clear
that
his
weekly
bills
were
compiled
by
a
clever
writer
of
fiction
it
was
his
first
experience
of
lodgings
and
the
difficulty
of
saying
unpleasant
things
to
a
woman
other
than
his
wife
was
not
the
least
of
his
troubles
he
changed
his
lodgings
for
a
third
time
and
much
surprised
at
his
continued
silence
sought
out
a
cousin
of
hers
named
joe
pett
and
poured
his
troubles
into
that
gentleman
reluctant
ear
if
she
was
to
ask
me
to
take
her
back
he
concluded
i
not
sure
mind
you
that
i
would
do
so
it
does
you
credit
said
pett
well
i
must
be
off
and
i
expect
she
be
very
much
obliged
to
anybody
that
told
her
so
said
hatchard
clutching
at
the
other
sleeve
pett
gazing
into
space
said
that
he
thought
it
highly
probable
it
wants
to
be
done
cleverly
though
said
hatchard
else
she
might
get
the
idea
that
i
wanted
to
go
back
i
you
know
she
moved
said
pett
with
the
air
of
a
man
anxious
to
change
the
conversation
eh
said
the
other
number
john
street
said
pett
told
my
wife
going
to
take
in
lodgers
calling
herself
harris
after
her
maiden
name
he
went
off
before
hatchard
could
recover
and
the
latter
at
once
verified
the
information
in
part
by
walking
round
to
his
old
house
bits
of
straw
and
paper
littered
the
front
garden
the
blinds
were
down
and
a
bill
was
pasted
on
the
front
parlor
window
aghast
at
such
determination
he
walked
back
to
his
lodgings
in
gloomy
thought
on
saturday
afternoon
he
walked
round
to
john
street
and
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
as
he
passed
stole
a
glance
at
no
he
recognized
the
curtains
at
once
and
seeing
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
room
leaned
over
the
palings
and
peered
at
a
card
that
stood
on
the
furnished
apartments
for
single
young
man
board
if
desired
he
walked
away
whistling
and
after
going
a
little
way
turned
and
passed
it
again
he
passed
in
all
four
times
and
then
with
an
odd
grin
lurking
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
strode
up
to
the
front
door
and
knocked
loudly
he
heard
somebody
moving
about
inside
and
more
with
the
idea
of
keeping
his
courage
up
than
anything
else
gave
another
heavy
knock
at
the
door
it
was
thrown
open
hastily
and
the
astonished
face
of
his
wife
appeared
before
him
what
do
you
want
she
inquired
sharply
hatchard
raised
his
hat
he
said
politely
what
do
you
want
repeated
his
wife
i
called
said
hatchard
clearing
his
throat
i
called
about
the
bill
in
the
window
illustration
i
called
about
the
bill
in
the
window
hatchard
clutched
at
the
well
she
gasped
i
like
to
see
the
rooms
said
the
other
but
you
ai
a
single
young
man
said
his
wife
recovering
i
as
good
as
single
said
hatchard
i
should
say
better
you
ai
young
objected
hatchard
i
three
years
younger
than
what
you
are
said
hatchard
dispassionately
his
wife
lips
tightened
and
her
hand
closed
on
the
door
hatchard
put
his
foot
in
if
you
do
want
lodgers
why
do
you
put
a
bill
up
he
inquired
i
do
take
the
first
that
comes
said
his
wife
i
pay
a
week
in
advance
said
hatchard
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
of
course
if
you
afraid
of
having
me
here
afraid
o
giving
way
to
tenderness
i
mean
afraid
choked
hatchard
tenderness
i
i
just
a
matter
o
business
continued
her
husband
that
my
way
of
looking
at
it
that
a
man
way
i
women
are
different
they
ca
come
in
said
hatchard
breathing
hard
hatchard
obeyed
and
clapping
a
hand
over
his
mouth
ascended
the
stairs
behind
her
at
the
top
she
threw
open
the
door
of
a
tiny
bedroom
and
stood
aside
for
him
to
enter
hatchard
sniffed
critically
smells
rather
stuffy
he
said
at
last
you
need
have
it
said
his
wife
abruptly
there
plenty
of
other
fish
in
the
sea
yes
and
i
expect
they
stay
there
if
they
saw
this
room
said
the
other
do
think
i
want
you
to
have
it
because
i
do
said
hatchard
making
a
preliminary
movement
to
showing
him
downstairs
they
might
suit
me
said
hatchard
musingly
as
he
peeped
in
at
the
door
i
should
be
at
home
much
i
a
man
that
fond
of
spending
his
evenings
out
hatchard
checking
a
retort
eyed
him
grimly
i
seen
worse
he
said
slowly
but
then
i
seen
a
good
many
how
much
are
you
asking
seven
shillings
a
week
replied
his
wife
with
breakfast
tea
and
supper
a
pound
a
week
hatchard
nearly
whistled
but
checked
himself
just
in
time
i
give
it
a
trial
he
said
with
an
air
of
unbearable
patronage
hatchard
hesitated
if
you
come
here
you
quite
understand
it
on
a
business
footing
she
said
o
course
said
the
other
with
affected
surprise
what
do
you
think
i
want
it
on
you
come
here
as
a
stranger
and
i
look
after
you
as
a
stranger
continued
his
wife
certainly
said
the
other
i
shall
be
made
more
comfortable
that
way
i
sure
but
of
course
if
you
afraid
as
i
said
before
of
giving
way
to
tender
tender
fiddlesticks
interrupted
his
wife
flushing
and
eying
him
angrily
i
come
in
and
bring
my
things
at
nine
said
hatchard
i
like
the
windows
open
and
the
rooms
aired
a
bit
and
what
about
the
sheets
what
about
them
inquired
his
wife
do
put
me
in
damp
sheets
that
all
said
hatchard
one
place
i
was
at
he
broke
off
suddenly
well
said
his
wife
quickly
was
very
particular
about
them
said
hatchard
recovering
well
to
you
i
want
three
weeks
in
advance
said
his
wife
three
exclaimed
the
other
three
weeks
in
advance
why
those
are
my
terms
said
hatchard
take
or
leave
it
would
be
better
if
you
left
hatchard
looked
thoughtful
and
then
with
obvious
reluctance
took
his
purse
from
one
pocket
and
some
silver
from
another
and
made
up
the
required
sum
and
what
if
i
not
comfortable
here
he
inquired
as
his
wife
hastily
pocketed
the
money
it
be
your
own
fault
was
the
reply
hatchard
looked
dubious
and
in
a
thoughtful
fashion
walked
downstairs
and
let
himself
out
he
began
to
think
that
the
joke
was
of
a
more
complicated
nature
than
he
had
expected
and
it
was
not
without
forebodings
that
he
came
back
at
nine
that
night
accompanied
by
a
boy
with
his
baggage
his
gloom
disappeared
the
moment
the
door
opened
the
air
inside
was
warm
and
comfortable
and
pervaded
by
an
appetizing
smell
of
cooked
meats
upstairs
a
small
bright
fire
and
a
neatly
laid
awaited
his
arrival
he
sank
into
an
and
rubbed
his
hands
then
his
gaze
fell
on
a
small
bell
on
the
table
and
opening
the
door
he
rang
for
supper
yes
sir
said
hatchard
entering
the
room
supper
please
said
the
new
lodger
with
dignity
hatchard
looked
bewildered
well
there
it
is
she
said
indicating
the
table
you
do
want
me
to
feed
you
do
you
the
lodger
eyed
the
small
dry
piece
of
cheese
the
bread
and
butter
and
his
face
fell
i
i
thought
i
smelled
something
cooking
he
said
at
last
illustration
i
thought
i
smelled
something
cooking
he
said
oh
that
was
my
supper
said
hatchard
with
a
smile
i
i
very
hungry
said
hatchard
trying
to
keep
his
temper
it
the
cold
weather
i
expect
said
hatchard
thoughtfully
it
does
affect
some
people
that
way
i
know
please
ring
if
you
want
anything
she
left
the
room
humming
blithely
and
hatchard
after
sitting
for
some
time
in
silent
consternation
got
up
and
ate
his
frugal
meal
the
fact
that
the
held
three
pints
and
was
filled
to
the
brim
gave
him
no
satisfaction
he
was
still
hungry
when
he
arose
next
morning
and
with
curiosity
tempered
by
uneasiness
waited
for
his
breakfast
hatchard
came
in
at
last
and
after
polite
inquiries
as
to
how
he
had
slept
proceeded
to
lay
breakfast
a
fresh
loaf
and
a
large
teapot
appeared
and
the
smell
of
frizzling
bacon
ascended
from
below
then
hatchard
came
in
again
and
smiling
benevolently
placed
an
egg
before
him
and
withdrew
two
minutes
later
he
rang
the
bell
you
can
clear
away
he
said
as
hatchard
entered
the
room
what
no
breakfast
she
said
holding
up
her
hands
well
i
heard
of
you
single
young
men
but
i
never
thought
the
tea
cold
and
as
black
as
ink
growled
the
indignant
lodger
and
the
egg
is
eatable
i
afraid
you
a
bit
of
a
said
hatchard
shaking
her
head
at
him
i
sure
i
try
my
best
to
please
i
do
mind
what
i
do
but
if
you
not
satisfied
you
better
go
look
here
emily
began
her
husband
do
you
me
said
hatchard
quickly
the
idea
a
lodger
too
you
know
the
arrangement
you
better
go
i
think
if
you
ca
behave
yourself
i
wo
go
till
my
three
weeks
are
up
said
hatchard
doggedly
so
you
may
as
well
behave
yourself
i
ca
pamper
you
for
a
pound
a
week
said
hatchard
walking
to
the
door
if
you
want
pampering
you
had
better
go
a
week
passed
and
the
additional
expense
caused
by
getting
most
of
his
meals
out
began
to
affect
hatchard
health
his
wife
on
the
contrary
was
in
excellent
spirits
and
coming
in
one
day
explained
the
absence
of
the
by
stating
that
it
was
wanted
for
a
new
lodger
he
taken
my
other
two
rooms
she
said
smiling
the
little
back
parlor
and
the
front
bedroom
i
full
up
now
would
he
like
my
table
too
inquired
hatchard
with
bitter
sarcasm
his
wife
said
that
she
would
inquire
and
brought
back
word
next
day
that
sadler
the
new
lodger
would
like
it
it
disappeared
during
hatchard
enforced
absence
at
business
and
a
small
bamboo
table
weak
in
the
joints
did
duty
in
its
stead
the
new
lodger
a
man
of
middle
age
with
a
ready
tongue
was
a
success
from
the
first
and
it
was
only
too
evident
that
hatchard
was
trying
her
best
to
please
him
hatchard
supping
on
bread
and
cheese
more
than
once
left
that
wholesome
meal
to
lean
over
the
balusters
and
smell
the
hot
meats
going
into
sadler
you
spoiling
him
he
said
to
hatchard
after
the
new
lodger
had
been
there
a
week
mark
my
words
he
get
above
himself
that
my
said
his
wife
briefly
do
come
to
me
if
you
get
into
trouble
that
all
said
the
other
hatchard
laughed
derisively
you
do
like
him
that
what
it
is
she
remarked
he
asked
me
yesterday
whether
he
had
offended
you
in
any
way
oh
he
did
did
he
snarled
hatchard
let
him
keep
himself
to
himself
and
mind
his
own
business
he
said
he
thinks
you
have
got
a
bad
temper
continued
his
wife
he
thinks
perhaps
it
indigestion
caused
by
eating
cheese
for
supper
always
hatchard
affected
not
to
hear
and
lighting
his
pipe
listened
fer
some
time
to
the
hum
of
conversation
between
his
wife
and
sadler
below
with
an
expression
of
resignation
on
his
face
that
was
almost
saintly
he
knocked
out
his
pipe
at
last
and
went
to
bed
half
an
hour
passed
and
he
was
still
awake
his
wife
voice
had
ceased
but
the
gruff
tones
of
sadler
were
still
audible
then
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
as
a
faint
cry
of
alarm
and
the
sound
of
somebody
rushing
upstairs
fell
on
his
ears
the
next
moment
the
door
of
his
room
burst
open
and
a
wild
figure
stumbling
in
the
darkness
rushed
over
to
the
bed
and
clasped
him
in
its
arms
help
gasped
his
wile
voice
oh
alfred
alfred
said
hatchard
in
a
prim
voice
as
he
struggled
in
vain
to
free
himself
i
so
so
sobbed
hatchard
that
no
reason
for
coming
into
a
lodger
room
and
throwing
your
arms
round
his
neck
said
her
husband
severely
do
be
gasped
hatchard
he
he
sitting
downstairs
in
my
room
with
a
paper
cap
on
his
head
and
a
in
his
hand
and
he
he
says
he
the
the
emperor
of
china
he
who
inquired
her
husband
replied
hatchard
almost
strangling
him
he
made
me
kneel
in
front
o
him
and
keep
touching
the
floor
with
my
head
the
shook
in
sympathy
with
hatchard
husbandly
emotion
well
it
nothing
to
do
with
me
he
said
at
last
he
mad
said
his
wife
in
a
tense
whisper
stark
staring
mad
he
says
i
his
favorite
wife
and
he
made
me
stroke
his
forehead
the
bed
shook
again
i
do
see
that
i
have
any
right
to
interfere
said
hatchard
after
he
had
quieted
the
bedstead
he
your
lodger

my
husband
said
hatchard

said
hatchard
you
remembered
that

alfred
said
his
wife
and
are
you
sorry
for
all
your
bad
behavior
demanded
hatchard
hatchard
hesitated
then
a
clatter
of
downstairs
moved
her
to
speech
she
sobbed
and
you
want
me
to
take
you
back
queried
the
generous
hatchard
said
his
wife
hatchard
got
out
of
bed
and
striking
a
match
lit
the
candle
and
taking
his
overcoat
from
a
peg
behind
the
door
put
it
on
and
marched
downstairs
hatchard
still
trembling
followed
behind
what
all
this
he
demanded
throwing
the
door
open
with
a
flourish
sadler
still
holding
the
and
still
with
the
paper
cap
on
his
head
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
then
as
he
saw
the
unkempt
figure
of
hatchard
with
the
scared
face
of
hatchard
peeping
over
his
shoulder
his
face
grew
red
his
eyes
watered
and
his
cheeks
swelled
he
said
explosively
talk
english
not
chinese
said
hatchard
sternly
illustration
he
said
explosively
sadler
threw
down
the
and
to
hatchard
great
annoyance
clapped
his
open
hand
over
his
mouth
and
rocked
with
merriment
sh
sh
she
she
he
spluttered
that
do
said
hatchard
hastily
with
a
warning
frown
to
me
gurgled
sadler

to
have
seen
it
alf
i
shall
never
get
over
it
never
it
no
no
good
at
me
i
ca
help
myself
he
put
his
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
and
leaned
back
exhausted
when
he
removed
it
he
found
himself
alone
and
everything
still
but
for
a
murmur
of
voices
overhead
anon
steps
sounded
on
the
stairs
and
hatchard
grave
of
face
entered
the
room
outside
he
said
briefly
what
said
the
astounded
sadler
why
it
eleven
i
ca
help
it
if
it
twelve
was
the
reply
you
play
the
fool
and
spoil
things
by
laughing
now

you
going
or
have
i
got
to
put
you
out
he
crossed
the
room
and
putting
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
protesting
sadler
pushed
him
into
the
passage
and
taking
his
coat
from
the
peg
held
it
up
for
him
sadler
abandoning
himself
to
his
fate
got
into
it
slowly
and
indulged
in
a
few
remarks
on
the
subject
of
ingratitude
i
ca
help
it
said
his
friend
in
a
low
voice
i
had
to
swear
i
never
seen
you
before

she
believe
you
said
the
staring
sadler
shivering
at
the
open
door
no
said
hatchard
slowly
but
she
