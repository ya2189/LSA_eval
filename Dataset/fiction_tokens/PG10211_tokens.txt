chapter
i
the
halt
on
the
adirondack
cabby
where
steve
fellows
why
max
he
slipped
away
with
his
little
as
soon
as
he
heard
you
say
we
stop
here
over
night
and
i
saw
him
picking
some
fat
white
grubs
out
of
those
old
rotten
stumps
we
passed
at
the
time
we
rested
an
hour
back
huh
just
like
slippery
steve
to
get
out
of
the
hard
work
we
going
to
have
cutting
enough
brush
for
making
our
shanty
shelter
tonight
seeing
that
we
did
fetch
our
bully
old
tent
along
this
trip
he
a
nice
one
i
should
say
you
about
steve
he
me
he
he
yank
a
of
fine
trout
out
of
that
where
it
looked
so
just
back
there
he
to
in
too
i
reckon
and
when
you
the
fish
you
be
you
said
what
you
did
well
let
get
a
move
on
and
start
that
shanty
i
chose
this
place
partly
on
account
of
there
being
so
much
brush
handy
you
see
sure
you
did
max
it
takes
you
to
notice
things
that
miss
our
eyes
here
let
me
handle
the
hatchet
because
you
see
i
was
such
a
truthful
little
shaver
away
back
that
my
folks
often
regretted
they
had
named
me
george
washington
all
i
say
then
they
wiser
than
they
knew
when
they
let
it
at
regrets
a
george
washington
you
i
thinking
the
boy
answering
to
the
peculiar
name
of
laughed
as
he
began
to
swing
the
hatchet
and
cut
down
some
of
the
required
brush
which
having
camped
many
times
before
he
knew
was
suitable
for
their
requirements
besides
this
sturdy
young
chap
with
the
lower
limbs
that
were
a
little
bowed
and
which
fact
had
doubtless
suggested
such
a
nickname
to
his
schoolmates
there
were
two
others
busily
engaged
in
gathering
the
material
to
be
used
in
affording
them
a
rude
but
effective
shelter
during
the
coming
night
the
one
whom
they
called
max
seemed
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
leader
for
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
in
every
pack
of
boys
some
one
takes
the
initiative
his
whole
name
was
max
hastings
and
on
numberless
occasions
he
had
shown
an
aptitude
for
doing
things
when
the
occasion
arose
that
gained
him
the
respect
of
his
chums
for
a
complete
record
of
these
achievements
the
reader
is
referred
to
earlier
volumes
of
this
series
where
between
the
covers
will
be
found
much
interesting
and
instructive
reading
the
third
boy
of
the
trio
in
sight
was
toby
jucklin
while
toby
was
certainly
agile
enough
when
it
came
to
acrobatic
stunts
and
such
things
as
boys
are
fond
of
indulging
in
his
vocal
cords
often
loved
to
play
sad
pranks
with
his
manner
of
speech
as
the
reader
has
already
discovered
toby
was
fain
to
stutter
in
the
most
agonizing
fashion
when
one
of
these
fits
came
upon
him
he
would
get
red
in
the
face
and
show
the
greatest
difficulty
in
framing
certain
words
then
all
of
a
sudden
as
though
taking
a
grip
on
himself
toby
would
stop
short
draw
in
a
long
breath
give
a
sharp
whistle
and
strange
to
say
start
talking
as
plainly
as
the
next
one
in
time
perhaps
he
would
conquer
this
weakness
which
after
all
is
only
caused
by
nervousness
and
a
desire
to
rattle
out
words
there
was
a
fourth
chum
also
the
steve
spoken
of
and
who
had
slipped
away
with
his
new
and
a
handful
of
fat
grubs
as
soon
as
he
heard
max
say
they
had
gone
far
enough
on
their
way
steve
being
one
of
those
hasty
lads
who
do
a
thing
while
many
people
would
be
only
figuring
it
out
had
long
ago
fallen
heir
to
a
number
of
suggestive
nicknames
among
others
steve
and
old
lightning
these
four
lads
were
a
long
ways
from
their
home
town
of
carson
nestled
on
the
evergreen
river
and
near
which
we
have
seen
them
in
the
earlier
books
of
this
series
successfully
carry
out
numerous
of
their
undertakings
in
fact
they
were
deep
in
the
wildest
part
of
the
famous
adirondacks
at
the
time
we
run
across
them
on
this
particular
occasion
there
was
not
a
town
within
many
miles
nor
for
that
matter
a
regular
camp
where
summer
guests
were
entertained
the
difficulties
to
be
encountered
along
this
carry
were
so
great
that
ordinary
excursionists
avoided
it
severely
indeed
few
fishermen
ever
invaded
these
solitudes
although
there
were
undoubtedly
many
places
where
trout
of
generous
size
might
be
picked
up
all
this
would
make
it
seem
a
bit
queer
that
max
and
his
three
chums
should
venture
into
this
section
of
the
wilderness
without
a
guide
along
so
perhaps
it
might
be
wise
to
enter
upon
explanations
while
the
opportunity
is
open
now
these
tried
and
true
chums
had
had
strange
things
happen
to
them
before
but
they
were
well
agreed
that
their
present
undertaking
far
exceeded
everything
else
that
had
ever
come
their
way
at
least
so
far
as
its
being
a
romantic
quest
was
concerned
everything
combined
to
make
it
seem
a
page
torn
from
one
of
those
fairy
books
they
used
to
love
to
read
when
much
younger
and
more
gullible
in
the
first
place
it
was
a
wonderful
piece
of
luck
that
came
their
way
when
the
school
directors
agreed
after
the
summer
was
half
over
that
the
school
buildings
required
considerable
alterations
in
order
to
make
them
sanitary
for
the
coming
winter
and
really
a
special
providence
that
watches
over
the
fortunes
of
boys
and
girls
must
have
caused
the
carpenters
and
masons
to
go
on
a
protracted
strike
so
that
when
this
had
been
finally
settled
there
was
not
nearly
time
enough
left
in
which
to
complete
the
extensive
repairs
school
had
started
and
gone
along
in
a
fashion
for
some
weeks
but
everybody
was
sore
about
it
the
builders
complained
that
they
could
not
accomplish
half
the
work
they
should
because
of
the
annoyance
of
having
so
many
children
trotting
around
and
bothering
them
and
the
teachers
were
almost
distracted
on
account
of
the
constant
pounding
together
with
the
presence
of
rough
men
who
broke
in
upon
classes
and
forced
them
to
vacate
certain
rooms
because
they
had
to
do
something
there
and
so
along
about
the
first
of
october
the
school
board
wisely
concluded
that
a
vacation
of
some
two
weeks
would
do
far
less
harm
to
the
scholars
than
a
continuation
of
these
interruptions
besides
the
teachers
on
their
part
threatened
to
also
strike
unless
relief
came
promptly
imagine
the
delight
of
such
fellows
as
max
steve
and
toby
jucklin
all
of
whom
loved
life
in
the
open
so
much
when
they
got
the
chance
to
further
indulge
this
propensity
especially
at
the
most
glorious
time
of
the
whole
year
when
the
nut
crop
was
coming
on
the
trees
turning
red
and
yellow
from
the
magical
touch
of
jack
frost
cold
fingers
with
a
tang
in
the
air
that
made
a
fellow
twice
as
hungry
as
he
ever
got
in
the
hot
old
and
then
as
though
fate
had
determined
to
make
this
the
most
wonderful
of
periods
in
all
their
checkered
careers
a
thing
happened
that
seemed
just
like
one
of
those
old
but
once
much
beloved
fairy
stories
perhaps
by
listening
to
the
workers
exchanging
comments
as
they
gather
the
necessary
brush
which
later
on
would
be
fashioned
into
a
shelter
capable
of
shedding
even
a
moderate
amount
of
rain
we
may
be
able
to
pick
up
enough
general
information
to
understand
the
nature
of
their
mission
up
into
the
adirondacks
was
speaking
at
the
time
he
had
a
little
fault
in
the
way
of
often
showing
a
disposition
to
look
at
the
darker
side
of
things
and
doubtless
being
unusually
tired
after
a
hard
day
tramp
with
such
a
heavy
pack
on
his
back
had
something
to
do
with
his
spirit
of
complaining
on
the
present
occasion
well
all
i
can
say
fellows
he
remarked
as
he
carried
an
armful
of
the
stuff
he
had
been
gathering
to
the
spot
where
max
had
already
commenced
to
erect
the
sides
of
the
squatty
shelter
by
driving
stakes
into
the
ground
is
that
i
hope
we
have
come
all
the
way
up
here
on
a
fool
errand
it
cost
hopewell
a
pretty
good
sum
and
be
a
real
disappointment
to
her
if
after
all
we
did
find
that
nephew
of
hers
roland
chase
honest
to
goodness
now
i
a
little
inclined
to
believe
he
be
leading
us
a
chase
if
you
want
my
opinion
oh
up
you
spluttered
the
indignant
toby
pausing
for
a
minute
to
wipe
the
beads
of
perspiration
from
his
brow
and
regain
his
breath
in
the
bargain
you
to
be
a
regular
old
that
what
with
all
your
tell
me
we
yet
in
anything
we
undertook
we
have
right
in
the
start
we
found
all
those
in
those
mussels
we
in
the
big
sunflower
river
and
laid
away
a
in
bank
for
the
crowd
sure
we
roland
chase
we
just
to
all
all
i
want
to
say
about
it
boys
observed
max
is
that
i
admire
the
grit
of
the
boy
they
told
us
he
was
something
of
a
dude
did
they
and
that
his
rich
uncle
was
afraid
he
never
amount
to
much
anyhow
so
what
did
he
do
but
make
a
most
will
at
least
everybody
who
heard
about
that
proviso
says
so
i
heard
judge
perkins
say
though
he
guessed
the
old
man
knew
boys
better
than
most
folks
and
had
taken
a
wise
course
to
prove
whether
this
roland
had
any
snap
in
him
or
not
well
he
was
left
just
two
thousand
dollars
cash
down
said
in
a
thoughtful
manner
as
though
reviewing
the
singular
circumstance
and
if
at
the
end
of
two
years
he
could
show
that
he
had
doubled
that
amount
besides
earning
his
own
living
why
he
was
to
come
into
of
his
uncle
fortune
some
of
our
carson
people
who
know
folks
over
in
sagamore
where
the
uncle
lived
tell
whopping
big
stories
about
the
size
of
that
fortune
i
heard
one
man
say
he
reckoned
it
was
as
much
as
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
all
the
funny
part
of
it
is
resumed
max
shaking
his
head
in
a
way
rather
odd
for
him
that
immediately
after
roland
received
his
two
thousand
in
cash
he
disappeared
from
the
scene
that
was
almost
two
years
ago
and
from
that
day
nobody
in
sagamore
has
ever
had
a
peep
at
him
the
fact
is
he
might
almost
be
dead
once
his
other
aunt
hopewell
who
lives
now
in
carson
had
a
few
lines
from
roland
he
simply
said
he
was
alive
and
well
and
that
he
had
hopes
of
seeing
her
again
one
of
these
fine
days
yes
that
burst
out
toby
in
a
disgusted
tone
but
not
a
did
he
give
about
what
he
was
or
if
he
meant
to
show
up
and
his
and
all
she
could
make
out
was
that
the
on
the
was
piedmont
which
on
looking
up
we
was
away
up
here
in
the
of
the
old
adirondacks
well
said
max
still
working
industriously
away
hopewell
is
getting
very
much
concerned
about
roland
somehow
she
seemed
to
fancy
the
boy
though
no
one
else
thought
he
ever
amount
to
anything
because
he
used
to
like
to
wander
around
in
the
woods
all
the
while
or
go
fishing
instead
of
studying
but
i
guess
those
people
had
ever
been
boys
themselves
and
all
of
us
can
appreciate
this
liking
for
the
open
that
roland
showed
and
so
pursued
after
the
fashion
of
a
who
a
crisis
in
his
tale
she
asked
max
here
if
he
would
be
willing
to
undertake
a
trip
to
the
mountains
with
several
of
his
good
chums
meaning
us
fellows
to
try
and
locate
the
missing
roland
and
bring
back
some
encouraging
news
for
the
good
old
soul
is
in
great
fear
that
the
second
year
will
soon
be
finished
and
unless
roland
is
able
to
show
four
thousand
dollars
in
cash
most
of
the
estate
will
go
to
his
older
cousin
frederick
hopewell
dislikes
this
chap
very
much
because
she
says
he
is
a
bad
man
who
drinks
and
gambles
and
does
all
sorts
of
things
old
ladies
detest
well
we
took
her
up
in
a
jiffy
as
soon
as
we
heard
the
glorious
news
about
school
being
closed
for
two
weeks
and
as
she
foots
all
the
bills
we
bound
to
have
a
jolly
time
of
it
even
if
we
do
run
across
roland
and
i
think
that
is
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
that
was
a
pretty
long
speech
for
even
to
make
and
yet
it
covered
considerable
of
the
ground
and
explained
just
how
it
came
that
max
and
his
three
comrades
chanced
to
be
so
far
away
from
the
home
town
the
boys
were
just
about
to
turn
their
attention
once
more
to
the
work
that
had
been
undertaken
when
all
of
them
suddenly
stopped
and
listened
that
was
steve
yelling
then
i
reckon
snapped
the
owner
of
the
bowed
legs
but
honest
injun
i
did
make
out
what
he
said
mebbe
now
he
struck
a
whopper
of
a
trout
and
was
giving
one
of
his
whoops
you
all
know
how
excited
steve
does
get
if
anything
out
of
the
way
happens
cried
toby
jncklin
jumping
to
his
feet
it
sound
like
he
was
yelpin
help
just
what
it
seemed
like
to
me
exclaimed
max
something
may
have
happened
to
steve
because
he
always
getting
himself
in
trouble
come
along
fellows
and
we
soon
find
out
there
he
whooping
it
up
again
and
this
time
every
one
of
the
trio
of
running
boys
could
plainly
detect
something
approaching
agony
in
the
thrilling
cry
of
help
oh
hurry
up
fellows
help
chapter
ii
gripped
by
a
giant
unseen
hands
that
max
and
toby
all
kept
their
wits
about
them
was
manifest
their
actions
had
made
this
clear
enough
for
each
of
the
trio
before
starting
on
the
jump
as
described
it
had
made
sure
to
pick
up
something
that
according
to
his
mind
was
apt
to
be
needed
max
for
instance
had
snatched
a
rope
that
hung
from
a
broken
branch
of
the
tree
and
which
one
of
the
boys
had
fetched
along
simply
because
a
rope
often
comes
in
mighty
handy
for
lots
of
things
besides
a
hanging
bee
on
his
part
toby
had
stooped
down
and
possessed
himself
of
the
camp
hatchet
if
it
proved
that
steve
was
being
attacked
by
a
bobcat
he
fancied
he
could
make
pretty
good
use
of
such
a
tool
in
an
emergency
true
to
his
hunter
instinct
made
out
to
secure
the
only
gun
which
had
been
brought
with
them
on
the
trip
as
they
ran
wildly
in
the
direction
from
whence
those
appeals
for
assistance
still
came
louder
than
ever
every
fellow
was
straining
his
vision
to
be
the
first
to
discover
what
it
could
be
that
was
causing
steve
to
let
out
such
alarming
whoops
they
did
not
have
very
far
to
go
before
suddenly
all
of
them
discovered
the
object
of
their
solicitude
he
seemed
to
be
standing
nearly
in
the
stream
and
still
holding
on
to
his
tough
little
steel
rod
oh
shucks
gasped
almost
out
of
breath
from
his
violent
exertions
he
only
struck
a
mud
turtle
or
something
like
that
and
wants
us
to
come
and
see
it
a
burning
shame
to
give
us
all
such
a
scare
over
a
measly
turtle
you
it
a
fish
ejaculated
toby
keep
on
running
snapped
max
he
needs
help
and
in
a
hurry
too
this
sort
of
talk
amazed
both
the
others
so
far
as
they
could
see
steve
stood
there
quite
alone
they
looked
again
but
could
see
no
savage
animal
attacking
their
comrade
nor
was
there
any
vast
disturbance
in
the
water
as
though
some
marine
monster
might
be
trying
to
drag
him
down
besides
such
things
as
alligators
or
sharks
were
utterly
unknown
up
here
in
the
adirondacks
but
max
he
all
right
as
far
as
i
can
see
expostulated
in
reality
unwilling
to
keep
up
that
violent
exertion
just
to
please
some
silly
whim
on
the
part
of
the
fisherman
who
like
as
not
would
give
them
the
laugh
after
they
came
up
puffing
and
blowing
like
porpoises
look
again
snapped
max
do
you
see
how
deep
he
in
pretty
nearly
up
to
his
waist
is
he
that
all
right
said
but
if
the
silly
has
gone
and
waded
deeper
than
he
meant
to
why
do
he
just
turn
around
and
walk
out
again
because
he
ca
max
told
him
still
running
hey
hindering
him
stammered
toby
thrilled
by
this
new
mystery
that
had
so
suddenly
dawned
upon
them
the
sand
got
too
tight
a
grip
on
him
cried
max
and
he
sinking
deeper
all
the
time
oh
thunder
it
quicksand
then
exploded
having
now
the
key
to
the
enigma
explaining
steve
strange
action
as
well
as
his
queer
antics
while
floundering
about
out
there
in
the
little
stream
both
boys
could
easily
see
that
may
evidently
spoke
the
truth
so
those
envious
spanish
courtiers
found
it
easy
to
balance
an
egg
on
end
after
columbus
showed
them
how
to
do
the
trick
in
another
half
minute
they
arrived
on
the
shore
of
the
little
stream
steve
out
there
with
the
shallow
water
coming
now
up
almost
to
his
waist
greeted
their
arrival
with
a
sickly
grin
sorry
to
bother
you
boys
he
said
but
seems
like
i
gone
and
got
into
a
nasty
pickle
please
yank
me
out
of
this
wo
you
impetuous
was
about
to
instantly
start
forward
when
max
gripped
him
by
the
arm
do
be
foolish
he
told
the
other
severely
you
only
get
yourself
in
the
same
boat
if
you
stood
there
and
tried
to
drag
steve
out
and
two
would
be
harder
to
take
care
of
than
one
but
say
do
be
slow
about
starting
something
will
you
urged
steve
once
again
looking
nervous
why
i
sinking
right
along
i
tell
you
every
time
i
try
to
get
one
foot
up
t
other
goes
down
three
inches
further
because
i
have
to
bear
all
my
weight
on
it
this
is
no
laughing
matter
boys
i
be
swallowed
up
before
your
eyes
soon
if
you
do
get
busy
max
you
ought
to
know
how
to
extricate
a
fellow
from
the
quicksand
there
are
lots
of
ways
in
which
it
can
be
done
the
other
told
him
meanwhile
measuring
distances
with
his
eye
as
though
he
already
had
a
plan
in
mind
if
when
you
first
discovered
that
you
were
sinking
you
had
thrown
yourself
sideways
and
started
to
crawl
or
roll
regardless
of
how
wet
you
got
you
might
have
made
it
for
in
that
way
you
have
presented
more
of
your
body
to
the
action
of
the
sand
then
a
mattress
could
be
made
from
branches
weeds
or
any
old
thing
that
would
bear
the
weight
of
one
or
two
of
us
but
i
got
even
a
better
scheme
than
that
to
work
please
hurry
pleaded
the
imprisoned
boy
keep
cool
steve
advised
max
because
there
positively
no
danger
now
that
we
on
deck
but
tell
me
what
you
mean
to
do
max
continued
steve
make
use
of
this
rope
which
you
see
i
just
happened
to
fetch
along
explained
the
other
holding
up
the
article
in
question
it
going
to
save
time
too
because
one
of
us
would
have
had
to
run
back
to
camp
and
that
must
mean
delay
you
deep
enough
in
as
it
is
i
guess
a
whole
lot
deeper
than
is
pleasant
i
tell
you
steve
instantly
added
why
at
the
rate
it
sucking
me
down
i
guess
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
water
would
be
up
to
my
chin
and
then
oh
fellows
just
imagine
how
i
feel
when
it
began
to
cover
my
mouth
you
not
going
away
i
hope
max
this
last
almost
frantic
cry
was
caused
by
a
movement
on
the
part
of
the
one
on
whom
poor
steve
hopes
most
depended
i
going
to
shin
up
this
big
tree
that
sends
a
limb
out
right
over
your
head
do
you
see
steve
max
told
him
reassuringly
once
i
get
above
you
and
we
make
good
use
of
this
rope
of
mine
the
limb
will
act
as
a
lever
and
when
the
boys
get
to
pulling
at
the
other
end
of
the
rope
you
just
to
come
out
that
all
there
is
about
it
hurrah
that
the
ticket
shouted
seeing
the
game
now
for
the
first
time
steve
you
as
good
as
landed
bless
that
old
rope
it
already
proved
worth
its
weight
in
gold
steve
watched
operations
anxiously
despite
the
positive
assurance
conveyed
in
these
words
from
his
chums
the
terrible
grip
of
that
clinging
sand
made
him
cold
with
apprehension
he
imagined
all
sorts
of
things
from
the
rope
breaking
under
the
sudden
and
terrible
strain
to
his
arms
being
drawn
from
their
sockets
in
the
battle
between
the
tenacious
sand
and
the
muscular
ability
of
the
two
boys
ashore
when
max
managed
to
reach
a
point
directly
above
the
one
in
peril
straddling
the
friendly
limb
as
only
a
nimble
boy
could
do
he
quickly
fashioned
a
at
one
end
of
the
rope
this
he
lowered
until
steve
could
snatch
it
which
he
did
with
all
the
eagerness
shown
by
the
drowning
man
who
clutches
at
a
straw
fix
the
noose
under
your
arms
steve
directed
the
master
of
ceremonies
calmly
enough
though
possibly
max
was
more
excited
than
he
chose
to
let
the
other
see
and
get
the
knot
around
so
it
will
be
exactly
in
front
then
when
i
give
the
word
for
the
boys
to
commence
heaving
you
work
both
legs
as
hard
as
ever
you
can
it
going
to
help
more
or
less
you
know
i
ca
do
much
up
here
in
the
way
of
pulling
for
i
lose
my
balance
but
make
up
your
mind
we
meaning
to
yank
you
out
of
that
in
a
jiffy
steve
oh
i
hope
so
max
i
surely
hope
so
everything
was
soon
ready
steve
had
complied
with
the
directions
and
now
awaited
the
issue
with
all
the
fortitude
he
could
command
afterwards
perhaps
steve
might
sometime
or
other
even
laugh
as
he
remembered
how
scared
he
was
but
just
then
with
the
difficulty
still
unadjusted
it
was
not
at
all
humorous
ready
everybody
called
out
max
receiving
an
affirmative
reply
from
three
pairs
of
lips
he
went
on
to
say
then
get
busy
pulling
make
it
a
steady
haul
and
no
jerks
or
hurt
steve
more
than
is
necessary
steady
there
no
hurry
remember
just
a
regular
increasing
pull
good
enough
boys
steve
had
obeyed
instructions
and
by
the
way
he
worked
both
feet
as
soon
as
he
felt
the
strain
one
might
think
he
was
practicing
swimming
lessons
it
must
have
given
him
more
or
less
physical
pain
to
feel
the
terrible
drag
of
the
rope
under
his
arms
but
he
shut
his
teeth
hard
together
and
kept
back
a
groan
now
rest
a
bit
toby
and
called
out
max
how
about
it
steve
you
moved
some
did
you
yes
yes
quite
a
little
max
cried
the
other
please
get
busy
again
right
away
i
sick
of
staying
in
this
old
quicksand
he
still
clung
tenaciously
to
his
steel
fishing
rod
as
though
he
meant
that
it
should
share
his
fate
once
more
the
team
ashore
started
in
now
their
task
seemed
lighter
as
though
having
succeeded
in
dragging
their
chum
up
several
inches
with
his
whole
weight
now
suspended
by
the
rope
the
job
was
going
to
be
finished
in
short
order
soon
steve
crowing
joyously
was
drawn
completely
out
of
the
water
he
gave
this
a
last
suggestive
kick
and
then
dangled
there
in
midair
spinning
around
like
a
teetotum
hand
me
your
rod
steve
commanded
max
then
use
your
arms
and
pull
yourself
up
on
the
limb
after
that
you
can
easily
hunch
along
like
i
do
and
get
to
the
main
trunk
it
all
over
but
the
shouting
steve
and
you
can
consider
yourself
pretty
lucky
to
get
off
as
easily
as
you
do
with
a
pair
of
wet
trousers
i
thankful
enough
max
you
can
make
sure
of
that
said
the
other
carrying
out
the
suggestion
and
thus
freeing
both
hands
for
the
task
of
mounting
to
the
friendly
limb
before
long
he
had
reached
the
ground
where
his
three
chums
each
gravely
shook
hands
with
him
steve
was
already
getting
back
his
nerve
that
had
been
under
a
severe
strain
but
anyway
i
did
have
bully
good
luck
pulling
out
fat
trout
boys
he
told
them
you
can
pick
up
a
dozen
along
this
side
of
the
stream
fact
is
it
was
such
splendid
fun
that
i
just
stood
too
long
in
one
place
catching
them
and
tossing
the
beauties
ashore
and
so
when
i
tried
to
move
why
i
could
to
save
my
life
it
felt
like
a
giant
had
gripped
both
feet
and
was
holding
me
down
the
more
i
tried
the
worse
it
got
whee
i
would
have
been
pretty
badly
scared
if
no
one
was
near
by
i
own
up
to
that
perhaps
the
others
mentally
considered
that
as
it
was
steve
had
looked
a
good
deal
concerned
at
the
time
of
their
arrival
but
not
wishing
to
harrow
his
feelings
any
further
just
then
they
kept
this
to
themselves
though
did
give
toby
a
suggestive
wink
to
which
the
other
replied
in
like
kind
it
was
found
upon
gathering
the
trophies
of
steve
skill
as
an
angler
that
they
had
quite
enough
for
a
meal
consequently
steve
announced
that
he
guessed
he
need
start
in
again
with
rod
and
hook
and
grub
all
of
them
were
soon
busily
engaged
in
fixing
up
the
camp
since
they
had
thought
it
best
not
to
try
and
fetch
a
heavy
tent
along
with
them
they
knew
it
would
be
necessary
to
construct
some
such
brush
shanty
shelter
every
night
unless
they
could
find
a
convenient
ledge
under
which
a
camp
could
be
made
but
all
of
these
boys
had
often
slept
under
the
stars
with
the
heavens
for
a
canopy
overhead
so
that
they
did
not
feel
at
all
worried
over
the
circumstance
as
the
sun
sank
lower
and
lower
toward
the
horizon
the
camp
began
to
assume
a
comfortable
air
the
brush
shelter
had
been
finished
and
pronounced
equal
to
any
they
had
ever
built
before
it
might
not
prove
wholly
but
as
for
keeping
off
the
dew
and
protecting
them
against
the
chilly
night
air
it
offered
them
all
the
comforts
of
home
as
steve
put
it
then
supper
was
started
a
fire
having
been
built
after
the
most
approved
method
in
vogue
among
guides
and
hunters
of
long
experience
indeed
max
and
his
companions
were
far
from
being
green
to
the
ways
of
the
woods
they
had
learned
heaps
through
their
many
camping
experiences
and
some
time
before
a
visit
to
an
old
trapper
had
initiated
them
into
dozens
of
secrets
of
the
craft
that
would
never
be
forgotten
again
the
talk
was
of
the
strange
mission
that
had
brought
them
up
to
the
adirondacks
could
not
seem
to
get
over
his
belief
that
they
were
bound
to
have
all
their
trouble
for
their
pains
what
sort
of
a
clue
have
we
got
to
work
on
for
a
starter
fellows
tell
me
he
went
on
to
say
just
as
they
were
starting
in
to
enjoy
the
supper
that
had
been
supervised
by
a
trio
of
eager
cooks
all
as
hungry
as
boys
could
well
be
and
continue
to
exist
all
we
know
is
that
when
this
boy
roland
chase
left
sagamere
almost
two
years
back
he
was
a
sickly
chap
and
with
only
one
decent
trait
about
him
which
was
his
love
for
outdoors
though
up
to
then
it
had
been
mostly
a
because
they
would
let
him
get
away
from
the
house
much
on
account
of
his
delicate
constitution
well
we
looking
for
some
such
chap
but
up
to
now
we
have
got
on
his
track
with
trapper
jim
in
the
north
woods
but
hold
on
expostulated
steve
you
forget
that
we
did
hear
about
a
boy
that
answered
that
description
though
nobody
seemed
to
know
his
name
he
was
sometimes
seen
in
the
company
of
a
old
guide
named
shanks
somewhere
around
mount
tom
district
and
now
we
come
up
this
way
in
the
hope
of
crossing
his
trail
not
that
got
much
expectation
myself
that
we
be
sure
to
find
this
same
roland
who
turns
out
to
be
a
sort
of
to
us
but
since
his
old
aunt
was
so
kind
as
to
finance
this
expedition
why
we
bound
to
do
all
we
can
to
make
it
a
blooming
success
that
what
well
commented
max
who
seemed
to
be
the
most
confident
one
of
the
quartette
remember
if
we
fail
to
make
connections
it
be
the
first
time
on
record
that
we
really
been
stumped
i
do
believe
in
stories
as
a
rule
success
comes
only
to
those
who
deserve
it
and
we
still
got
most
of
that
two
weeks
vacation
ahead
of
us
to
hunt
around
for
roland
chase
somehow
max
always
seemed
to
say
things
calculated
to
make
his
chums
feel
more
satisfied
it
is
a
mighty
good
thing
to
have
a
real
optimist
in
camp
especially
when
the
weather
gets
bad
and
everything
else
seems
to
go
wrong
even
took
on
a
more
cheerful
air
and
brightened
up
after
hearing
max
say
this
they
had
more
or
less
reason
to
feel
proud
of
the
record
they
had
made
in
the
past
so
far
as
accomplishing
things
went
and
the
people
around
carson
would
be
apt
to
tell
any
one
inquiring
about
max
and
his
cronies
that
they
had
actually
done
several
exceedingly
smart
things
and
were
boys
far
above
the
average
the
supper
was
voted
a
huge
success
and
never
had
fish
been
fried
a
more
delicious
brown
than
those
in
the
pan
perhaps
steve
entertained
a
private
opinion
of
his
own
to
the
effect
that
never
had
a
higher
price
been
paid
for
a
mess
of
fish
than
he
offered
up
when
he
found
himself
made
a
prisoner
of
the
unseen
giant
residing
under
the
quicksands
but
all
the
same
steve
devoured
his
share
of
the
fish
as
smartly
as
the
next
one
he
doubtless
felt
that
he
deserved
having
a
feast
after
his
adventure
in
supplying
the
materials
they
were
almost
through
eating
and
feeling
particularly
well
satisfied
as
is
usually
the
case
when
the
appetite
has
been
taken
care
of
when
toby
jucklin
was
seen
to
be
staring
straight
ahead
what
ails
you
toby
demanded
steve
discovering
the
mysterious
actions
of
the
other
think
you
see
a
ghost
or
was
it
a
whisked
past
smelling
our
fine
spread
here
speak
up
ca
you
and
tell
us
toby
managed
to
find
his
tongue
and
as
usual
when
excited
made
quite
a
mess
of
his
explanation
i
is
there
oh
look
for
yourselves
and
you
understand
i
tell
you
sometimes
toby
seemed
to
become
so
provoked
with
his
ungovernable
vocal
organs
that
he
would
get
angry
and
wind
up
by
speaking
as
plainly
as
the
next
one
but
before
then
max
and
perhaps
the
other
pair
in
the
bargain
had
discovered
a
figure
advancing
slowly
toward
them
eagerly
stared
perhaps
he
began
to
already
entertain
a
wild
hope
that
the
newcomer
would
prove
to
be
the
very
boy
whom
they
had
come
so
far
to
find
but
if
this
were
so
he
must
have
almost
immediately
discovered
his
mistake
for
the
other
was
a
and
lad
sturdily
built
and
apparently
the
son
of
some
woods
guide
for
he
carried
a
gun
and
was
dressed
in
rough
though
serviceable
khaki
trousers
and
blue
flannel
shirt

obed
grimes
bobs
up
howdy
strangers
said
the
other
as
he
slowly
approached
the
spot
where
max
and
his
three
chums
still
sat
around
the
fire
feasting
on
their
spread
i
happened
to
see
yer
blaze
and
guessed
i
drop
in
to
see
who
yah
might
be
often
anybody
comes
up
this
way
though
to
be
sure
thar
was
two
gentlemen
fishin
hereabouts
last
summer
somehow
max
liked
his
manner
of
speech
he
also
thought
he
could
detect
something
like
a
love
for
humor
in
those
sparkling
eyes
sit
down
and
have
a
bite
with
us
wo
you
he
remarked
making
a
suggestive
movement
with
his
hand
as
though
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
was
still
plenty
of
room
on
the
log
which
he
and
toby
jucklin
had
occupied
in
common
sorry
the
trout
given
out
but
got
plenty
of
other
grub
and
be
sure
you
welcome
the
sturdy
woods
boy
was
looking
them
over
suspicious
as
usual
rather
took
umbrage
at
this
action
he
eyed
the
newcomer
as
though
not
yet
quite
willing
to
echo
the
warm
invitation
accorded
him
by
max
but
steve
was
already
getting
an
extra
for
coffee
and
fortunately
there
still
remained
an
abundant
supply
of
the
amber
fluid
in
the
capacious
pot
apparently
the
newcomer
had
determined
that
it
would
be
prudent
for
him
to
comply
with
the
invitation
thus
cordially
given
so
he
sat
down
and
made
himself
at
home
up
there
in
the
woods
there
exists
a
genuine
hospitality
that
never
hesitates
to
extend
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
to
any
straggler
who
chances
to
enter
the
camp
there
seems
to
be
something
in
the
healthy
ozone
of
the
wilderness
that
makes
all
men
comrades
for
the
time
being
the
latchstring
is
always
out
in
camp
and
never
does
an
appeal
for
help
go
disregarded
max
proceeded
to
immediately
introduce
himself
and
his
three
chums
by
name
he
of
course
mentioned
the
fact
that
they
came
from
a
town
named
carson
situated
far
away
from
that
region
but
then
of
course
the
woods
boy
could
never
have
heard
of
such
a
place
before
still
his
eyebrows
arched
and
he
seemed
to
once
again
observe
his
entertainers
with
fresh
interest
but
then
when
max
hastings
chose
to
exert
himself
to
make
a
favorable
impression
every
one
fell
under
his
spell
and
when
toby
and
steve
noticed
that
max
did
not
think
fit
to
say
a
single
word
about
the
queer
mission
which
had
brought
them
to
the
mountains
they
too
concluded
that
it
would
be
just
as
well
not
to
be
too
hasty
about
telling
all
their
business
to
a
stranger
a
little
later
on
perhaps
when
they
came
to
become
better
acquainted
with
the
other
they
might
ply
him
with
questions
in
order
to
find
out
if
he
chanced
to
know
such
a
weakly
looking
fellow
as
roland
chase
of
course
after
that
it
was
up
to
the
other
to
tell
them
whom
he
was
he
did
not
have
any
hesitation
from
which
steve
concluded
there
could
be
no
reason
for
keeping
his
identity
a
secret
course
i
got
a
name
too
even
if
it
ai
so
scrumptuous
as
yours
but
obed
grimes
suits
me
just
as
well
and
it
ai
never
kept
me
from
eatin
three
square
meals
a
day
when
i
could
get
he
told
them
soberly
though
that
odd
little
gleam
in
his
eyes
mystified
max
somewhat
i
suppose
you
live
around
this
section
then
obed
he
remarked
as
he
cleaned
out
the
that
had
contained
the
ham
and
eggs
the
latter
having
been
carried
all
the
way
from
the
last
small
village
they
passed
through
and
which
supply
would
doubtless
be
the
last
they
might
enjoy
for
a
long
time
to
come
oh
yes
thar
a
plenty
of
grimeses
up
this
way
the
other
replied
promptly
fact
is
the
grimeses
are
a
big
family
all
told
grandad
grimes
to
start
with
and
he
going
on
ninety
now
then
uncle
hiram
uncle
silas
uncle
job
uncle
sephus
uncle
and
a
whole
lot
more
besides
aunt
rebecca
aunt
sophia
aunt
hetebel
and
glory
to
goodness
i
could
sit
here
for
ten
minutes
and
string
out
the
names
of
the
grimeses
there
are
in
the
mountains
but
say
hungry
and
you
excuse
me
if
i
get
busy
with
this
fine
grub
the
other
names
will
keep
till
next
time
i
reckon
whew
it
must
feel
funny
to
belong
to
such
a
big
family
remarked
steve
who
did
not
happen
to
have
any
close
relatives
himself
oh
shucks
none
of
ever
bother
about
any
said
the
boy
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
mouth
stuffed
of
the
ham
and
bread
which
he
presently
washed
down
with
a
copious
draught
of
hot
coffee
they
just
know
that
obed
he
take
good
care
o
hisself
began
to
show
a
rising
interest
in
the
other
his
suspicions
were
beginning
to
give
way
under
the
genial
ways
of
the
said
obed
that
smile
on
the
dusky
face
of
the
visitor
in
the
camp
had
commenced
to
get
its
work
in
by
degrees
perhaps
might
even
come
to
like
obed
grimes
though
truth
to
tell
he
had
always
despised
that
last
name
for
a
boy
answering
to
it
had
once
treated
in
a
most
humiliating
fashion
and
this
still
rankled
in
his
memory
although
years
had
fled
since
the
occurrence
do
you
mean
from
that
obed
he
went
on
to
remark
that
you
all
alone
up
here
in
the
woods
near
old
mount
tom
have
you
any
of
the
other
grimeses
along
with
you
the
boy
shook
his
head
in
the
negative
and
grinned
again
max
was
trying
to
study
him
and
he
found
the
task
one
well
worthy
of
his
best
efforts
in
the
beginning
he
determined
that
obed
was
no
ordinary
chap
but
possessed
of
sterling
characteristics
he
waited
for
the
conversation
to
get
further
along
confident
that
the
other
had
a
surprise
up
his
sleeve
which
he
might
condescend
to
share
with
them
after
he
had
become
fully
satisfied
they
were
to
be
trusted
and
that
he
could
look
upon
them
in
the
light
of
friends
nary
a
grimes
me
inside
o
twenty
miles
o
here
and
that
a
fact
he
assured
after
finishing
his
drinking
fact
is
most
o
the
family
do
know
jest
where
i
at
and
say
between
us
i
ai
a
carin
about
tellin
that
looked
a
bit
singular
thought
his
suspicions
returned
again
though
with
diminished
force
for
somehow
he
could
not
look
into
that
frank
and
even
merry
face
of
the
woods
boy
and
actually
believe
he
was
in
any
way
but
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
all
alone
i
like
to
know
burst
out
impetuous
steve
are
you
making
a
living
playing
at
guide
for
parties
of
tourists
or
fishermen
and
hunters
and
say
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
stay
all
alone
up
in
this
wilderness
right
through
the
winter
obed
grimes
nodded
his
head
cheerfully
i
ai
got
any
choice
in
the
matter
yuh
see
he
told
them
mysteriously
just
to
stay
why
it
would
bust
the
hull
business
to
smash
if
i
myself
to
skip
out
even
for
a
week
or
two
tied
down
to
it
that
right
exchanged
a
significant
look
toby
jucklin
he
scratched
his
head
with
the
air
of
one
who
found
himself
up
against
a
hard
knotty
problem
apparently
if
the
stranger
in
camp
was
trying
to
mystify
them
he
had
already
succeeded
in
tangling
up
the
wits
of
completely
max
continued
to
sit
there
and
take
it
all
in
there
was
no
need
of
his
saying
anything
so
long
as
the
other
fellows
had
embarked
on
the
task
of
drawing
obed
out
and
learning
just
what
he
was
doing
to
keep
him
marooned
up
there
summer
and
winter
like
a
regular
old
recluse
or
woodchuck
but
there
must
be
heaps
and
heaps
of
snow
here
winters
suggested
steve
and
i
think
you
find
it
pretty
hard
getting
about
oh
not
so
bad
when
you
have
obed
told
him
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
another
attack
on
the
contents
of
his
tin
panninkin
not
steve
hastened
to
say
as
though
he
had
guessed
that
this
would
be
the
answer
but
when
the
law
is
on
the
deer
and
partridges
it
must
be
hard
to
keep
to
a
regular
diet
of
trout
i
stand
them
for
a
while
but
in
the
end
i
get
sick
of
the
smell
of
cooking
oh
i
have
plenty
of
good
grub
along
chuckled
obed
i
was
on
my
way
home
at
the
time
i
glimpsed
your
fire
and
bein
full
o
wonder
concernin
who
could
be
around
these
diggings
right
now
i
crept
up
to
spy
on
ye
but
say
soon
i
glimpsed
your
crowd
and
saw
that
you
was
only
a
bunch
o
boys
why
i
felt
easier
i
knew
then
you
mean
to
bother
me
any
now
that
sounded
queer
again
thought
why
should
any
one
take
the
trouble
to
bother
obed
grimes
unless
indeed
he
had
been
doing
something
that
he
had
ought
to
and
hence
expected
to
be
visited
sooner
or
later
by
emissaries
of
the
law
possibly
in
the
shape
of
angry
game
wardens
all
sorts
of
strange
thoughts
flashed
through
that
active
brain
of
the
boy
with
the
bowed
legs
he
wondered
whether
obed
could
be
a
desperate
young
criminal
had
his
family
those
excellent
grimes
of
whom
he
had
spoken
in
such
proud
accents
cast
him
out
as
altogether
beyond
hope
could
hardly
think
this
when
he
looked
again
into
that
face
and
caught
the
gleam
of
those
merry
orbs
no
obed
might
be
a
sort
of
fellow
but
really
there
did
not
seem
to
be
much
of
guile
in
his
if
it
turned
out
to
be
so
then
he
was
ready
to
call
himself
a
mighty
poor
reader
of
character
so
he
too
relapsed
into
temporary
silence
and
let
steve
carry
on
the
interrogations
which
the
said
steve
considered
himself
very
well
qualified
to
do
since
he
aspired
in
his
secret
soul
to
some
fine
day
study
to
be
a
lawyer
but
why
should
anybody
want
to
bother
you
obed
he
asked
to
hear
you
talk
in
that
way
a
fellow
would
think
you
had
a
lot
of
enemies
hanging
around
trying
the
best
they
knew
how
to
give
you
trouble
well
i
ai
had
any
ever
since
i
been
here
admitted
the
other
with
a
slight
frown
crossing
his
face
but
lately
i
got
wind
some
news
that
worried
me
a
heap
fact
is
i
afraid
i
goin
to
be
right
smart
bothered
with
a
bunch
o
thieves
who
like
to
my
outfit
from
me
steve
fairly
gasped
he
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
what
the
other
was
so
deliberately
telling
him
max
listening
and
watching
that
expressive
face
of
obed
secretly
believed
the
newcomer
was
purposely
drawing
steve
on
meaning
to
surprise
him
when
finally
he
chose
to
explain
it
all
so
max
did
not
attempt
to
interfere
but
let
things
go
on
as
they
were
doing
satisfied
that
the
answer
to
the
conundrum
would
soon
come
steal
your
outfit
from
you
echoed
steve
when
he
could
catch
his
breath
do
you
mean
that
you
carrying
on
some
sort
of
business
then
up
here
in
the
woods
reckon
that
about
right
steve
obed
replied
and
his
familiar
use
of
the
other
name
could
be
easily
explained
by
that
spirit
of
free
masonry
that
exists
among
all
boys
i
got
a
business
which
looks
like
it
was
goin
to
pan
out
right
decent
and
make
me
some
money
in
the
bargain
that
why
they
meanin
to
rob
me
i
guess
anyhow
it
hinges
on
that
same
thing
and
i
thought
you
might
be
that
crowd
first
but
i
soon
saw
i
was
mistaken
and
that
you
be
my
friend
but
what
sort
of
business
is
it
you
in
obed
asked
steve
boldly
me
oh
i
only
a
farmer
confessed
the
other
chuckling
as
he
spoke
a
farmer
echoed
steve
looking
blank
but
how
could
anybody
steal
your
ground
away
or
carry
off
your
crops
i
like
to
know
why
yuh
do
jest
understand
steve
i
ai
no
regular
hayseed
a
fur
farmer
you
see
and
you
could
carry
my
crop
of
fox
pelts
away
easy
enough
on
your
own
back
chapter
iv
suspects
max
hastings
smiled
he
at
the
same
time
drew
a
breath
of
relief
satisfied
to
know
that
his
first
impression
of
the
sturdy
looking
young
chap
was
confirmed
and
convinced
that
the
said
obed
grimes
must
be
the
right
sort
of
fellow
steve
and
fairly
gasped
as
though
they
had
received
a
real
shock
at
the
same
time
the
eyes
of
the
former
glistened
with
interest
a
fur
farmer
do
you
say
obed
and
raising
foxes
for
the
market
are
you
he
burst
out
with
delightedly
now
i
read
a
heap
about
that
sort
of
thing
in
the
papers
and
magazines
but
i
never
thought
actually
run
across
anybody
that
had
the
nerve
and
confidence
to
go
into
it
as
a
business
and
you
say
you
making
good
are
you
obed
fine
i
turned
my
to
raisin
real
black
foxes
first
thing
explained
the
other
with
a
touch
of
genuine
pride
in
his
manner
max
could
easily
see
and
if
the
try
turns
out
as
profitable
as
i
reckon
she
promises
to
be
why
then
i
figgerin
on
tryin
to
raise
mink
and
marten
and
sech
other
furs
as
fetch
prices
then
i
guess
you
must
have
trapped
all
sorts
of
wild
animals
before
now
obed
suggested
steve
eagerly
so
you
know
their
habits
to
a
fraction
because
of
course
only
one
who
is
posted
in
that
direction
could
ever
hope
to
make
a
success
of
a
fur
farm
obed
grinned
and
nodded
his
head
oh
i
reckon
i
up
a
little
bit
in
all
sech
things
he
said
airily
enough
and
after
all
it
ai
so
hard
to
raise
foxes
i
was
afraid
fust
off
it
might
be
what
they
told
me
that
blacks
ai
to
be
relied
on
to
breed
true
to
strain
but
shucks
i
got
some
cubs
that
are
dandies
wait
till
you
see
boys
that
sounded
as
though
sooner
or
later
obed
meant
to
have
them
visit
his
fur
farm
and
see
with
their
own
eyes
what
he
had
been
doing
skeptical
once
more
told
himself
he
only
hoped
the
whole
thing
might
not
turn
out
to
be
a
myth
and
that
the
said
obed
himself
prove
to
be
a
deception
and
a
fraud
i
understand
that
the
pelts
of
black
foxes
are
worth
a
whole
lot
of
money
remarked
steve
fact
is
we
know
that
to
be
so
because
we
once
had
such
a
skin
given
to
us
by
a
man
who
made
a
business
of
trapping
it
all
depends
on
the
quality
of
the
pelt
explained
obed
some
worth
as
much
as
three
hundred
dollars
because
they
got
defects
yuh
see
then
again
a
real
fine
skin
has
fetched
as
much
as
hundred
dollars
in
london
markets
evidently
obed
was
well
posted
at
any
rate
whether
he
really
had
such
a
fur
farm
of
his
own
or
not
concluded
and
then
he
again
allowed
himself
to
give
imagination
free
rein
and
for
a
time
even
looked
on
obed
as
the
essence
of
truth
doubly
distilled
sitting
there
by
the
fire
which
one
of
he
boys
replenished
every
little
while
obed
told
them
many
very
interesting
things
connected
with
that
strange
farm
of
his
all
this
in
his
odd
vernacular
which
max
tried
to
get
the
hang
of
in
order
to
judge
whether
it
signified
that
the
country
boy
lacked
an
education
or
not
he
continued
to
be
more
or
less
mystified
however
though
concluding
that
obed
was
just
one
of
those
customary
country
boys
often
run
across
on
farms
who
take
especial
delight
in
joking
and
playing
little
tricks
which
they
consider
humorous
but
he
is
at
all
bad
i
stake
everything
on
that
max
also
told
himself
as
he
sat
and
listened
to
the
really
interesting
descriptions
given
by
the
other
of
his
successes
and
first
failures
along
the
difficult
line
of
breeding
foxes
in
captivity
with
scores
of
things
against
him
which
had
to
be
overcome
an
hour
passed
by
in
this
manner
when
max
saw
their
visitor
showing
signs
as
if
he
meant
to
leave
them
he
took
a
hand
in
the
conversation
which
up
to
then
had
been
almost
wholly
monopolized
by
steve
and
the
woods
boy
it
very
kind
of
you
to
invite
us
over
to
inspect
this
wonderful
little
fur
farm
of
yours
obed
he
went
on
to
say
but
you
have
to
give
us
directions
how
we
can
get
there
unless
you
mean
to
accept
our
offer
of
a
blanket
by
the
fire
here
tonight
when
we
could
go
along
with
you
in
the
morning
obed
looked
sober
i
like
to
stay
longer
with
you
boys
he
hastened
to
say
as
though
he
really
meant
it
but
i
ought
tuh
be
gettin
back
home
thar
some
duties
waitin
for
me
to
look
after
and
then
i
ai
quite
easy
in
my
mind
them
two
fellers
that
up
here
in
the
woods
they
meanin
to
do
any
shootin
even
if
they
have
got
lem
scott
along
as
a
guide
and
he
the
meanest
skunk
in
the
hull
county
lots
o
folks
do
say
and
a
poacher
in
the
bargain
that
the
wardens
are
layin
to
grab
one
o
these
fine
days
now
i
jest
up
and
tell
yuh
how
to
get
to
my
place
it
as
easy
as
water
runnin
he
entered
into
explicit
directions
and
max
pinned
them
in
his
memory
in
fact
obed
simply
told
them
to
follow
the
stream
up
three
miles
until
they
came
to
a
bunch
of
seven
birch
trees
on
the
bank
there
they
were
to
pick
up
a
trail
they
would
find
follow
it
half
a
mile
and
at
that
they
would
see
a
cabin
under
the
hemlocks
and
pines
which
would
be
his
humble
home
woods
we
got
it
all
down
pat
obed
said
steve
and
like
as
not
see
the
bunch
of
us
trailing
along
there
some
time
tomorrow
morning
i
always
been
crazy
to
see
a
fur
farm
after
reading
so
much
about
them
and
you
bet
i
do
mean
to
let
this
chance
slip
by
me
max
now
thought
it
time
to
make
a
few
inquiries
himself
he
wanted
to
ask
obed
whether
he
had
ever
run
across
a
boy
by
the
name
of
roland
chase
a
sickly
looking
chap
in
the
bargain
it
might
possible
to
pick
up
a
clue
in
this
way
and
they
had
reached
a
point
where
they
could
not
afford
to
let
any
opportunity
for
acquiring
information
get
past
them
in
order
to
pursue
this
course
however
max
realized
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
enter
into
some
sort
of
explanation
concerning
the
nature
of
the
peculiar
errand
that
had
tempted
them
to
come
to
the
adirondacks
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
or
two
obed
he
began
but
first
of
all
i
ought
to
tell
you
what
brings
us
here
accordingly
max
proceeded
to
explain
how
the
school
had
be
closed
for
two
or
more
weeks
in
early
october
and
what
a
singular
thing
came
about
to
tempt
them
into
taking
an
outing
he
was
watching
the
woods
boy
at
the
time
he
first
mentioned
hopewell
and
spoke
the
name
of
roland
chase
but
if
the
other
gave
any
unusual
signs
of
interest
max
failed
to
catch
the
same
still
obed
was
listening
with
all
his
might
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
unusual
story
of
the
inheritance
that
was
to
be
given
to
the
said
roland
in
case
he
made
good
interested
him
max
in
this
manner
explained
just
why
he
and
his
three
chums
had
accepted
the
generous
offer
of
the
elderly
lady
so
deeply
concerned
over
the
welfare
of
her
nephew
boland
that
she
was
ready
to
spend
almost
any
reasonable
sum
in
order
to
at
least
learn
that
the
poor
boy
was
alive
and
in
fairly
decent
health
they
had
been
told
to
assure
him
in
case
they
ever
managed
to
locate
the
elusive
roland
that
he
should
not
worry
because
of
not
being
able
to
comply
with
the
absurd
conditions
of
uncle
jerry
ridiculous
will
because
she
had
enough
of
this
world
goods
for
both
and
she
meant
to
leave
it
all
to
him
roland
so
she
begged
him
to
come
back
to
her
and
live
his
own
life
again
even
though
he
had
spent
the
last
penny
of
his
legacy
and
was
as
poor
as
job
turkey
all
this
made
an
interesting
story
and
must
have
amused
the
woods
boy
more
or
less
because
max
knew
how
to
put
considerable
pathos
in
it
obed
sat
there
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
to
keep
the
glow
of
the
fire
from
dazzling
him
occasionally
he
would
interrupt
to
ask
some
natural
question
which
made
max
think
he
was
taking
a
fair
amount
of
interest
in
the
account
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
concluded
max
was
whether
you
ever
happened
to
run
across
this
same
roland
chase
in
the
mountains
we
heard
about
a
fellow
answering
his
description
who
was
seen
in
company
with
a
dissipated
guide
named
shanks
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
help
us
out
obed
obed
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
so
far
as
i
knows
on
max
he
went
on
to
say
seriously
i
never
met
any
feller
like
yuh
say
face
to
face
about
that
man
shanks
i
know
he
said
to
be
a
tough
un
i
saw
him
some
months
back
down
at
sawyer
forks
and
by
hokey
now
that
you
mention
it
thar
a
sickly
lookin
young
feller
along
with
him
then
but
say
his
name
was
bob
jenks
or
somethin
like
that
and
not
roland
chase
oh
well
so
far
as
that
goes
said
max
he
may
have
changed
his
name
some
people
think
nothing
of
sailing
under
false
colors
and
if
it
turns
out
that
roland
has
taken
up
with
such
a
disreputable
character
as
this
drunken
guide
seems
to
be
i
do
wonder
at
him
wanting
to
hide
his
identity
so
you
think
you
must
be
going
home
do
you
obed
yep
the
other
observed
gaining
his
feet
and
i
wanter
to
thank
all
o
ye
for
givin
me
sech
a
pleasant
evenin
i
ai
had
sech
a
good
time
this
long
while
back
but
then
the
grimeses
all
are
to
roughin
it
granddad
used
to
be
away
all
by
hisself
for
as
much
as
two
years
trappin
up
in
canada
it
in
the
blood
i
reckon
now
yuh
mean
to
drop
in
and
visit
me
do
ye
i
be
expectin
yuh
and
have
something
to
eat
awarmin
though
course
i
ai
a
good
cook
like
you
fellers
as
has
had
so
much
experience
so
long
boys
he
waved
them
a
cheerful
goodbye
once
more
smiled
at
each
in
turn
whirled
on
his
heel
and
was
gone
seeming
to
vanish
in
the
shadows
of
the
nearby
woods
like
a
wisp
of
smoke
when
the
wind
strikes
it
as
steve
remarked
after
the
departure
of
their
guest
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
be
the
subject
of
conversation
about
the
fire
as
the
four
chums
lay
there
taking
things
easy
max
honest
to
goodness
now
remarked
do
you
really
take
any
stock
in
that
fairy
story
he
told
us
about
an
imaginary
fur
farm
it
struck
me
obed
is
givin
to
yarnin
just
for
the
love
of
it
all
that
stuff
about
his
relatives
may
have
been
true
and
again
only
nonsense
it
my
opinion
there
is
any
granddad
grimes
or
uncle
hiram
nicodemus
and
so
forth
he
grinned
like
everything
when
he
was
reeling
those
names
off
so
slick
yes
he
was
stringing
us
i
bet
you
burst
out
toby
just
then
who
would
have
to
when
he
had
a
lot
of
relations
with
such
names
make
me
grin
from
ear
to
ear
every
time
i
to
think
of
you
the
greatest
hand
to
anybody
i
ever
now
i
want
you
to
that
i
think
obed
the
and
i
taking
a
heap
of
in
seeing
that
bully
of
his
tomorrow
ai
you
max
certainly
i
am
replied
the
other
without
a
second
hesitation
in
the
first
place
you
must
understand
that
nobody
could
talk
so
interestingly
on
a
subject
unless
he
knew
a
lot
about
it
he
told
us
a
dozen
things
about
fur
farming
that
i
never
heard
before
huh
and
perhaps
nobody
else
ever
heard
of
them
either
max
grunted
the
far
from
satisfied
nothing
will
ever
satisfy
him
except
he
sees
those
kit
foxes
with
his
own
eyes
asserted
steve
almost
indignantly
handles
them
with
his
own
paws
and
asks
every
little
critter
whether
he
really
belongs
to
obed
grimes
is
the
worst
doubting
thomas
going
when
the
fit
comes
on
him
even
this
sort
of
talk
did
not
convince
the
objector
say
what
you
will
fellows
went
on
stubbornly
there
a
wheen
of
queer
things
connected
with
this
same
obed
grimes
and
i
take
that
back
till
he
shows
us
his
wonderful
old
farm
where
he
raises
black
foxes
for
the
fur
market
stop
and
think
how
mysteriously
he
popped
in
on
us
will
you
why
he
as
much
as
owned
up
that
he
had
been
spying
on
us
for
a
long
time
if
toby
here
had
discovered
him
peeking
and
pointed
that
way
chances
are
he
would
have
shown
up
at
all
now
what
made
him
snoop
around
our
camp
like
that
say
did
he
explain
all
that
just
as
straight
as
a
die
objected
steve
who
seemed
to
have
conceived
quite
a
fancy
for
obed
grimes
the
woods
boy
he
told
us
he
had
reason
to
fear
some
unscrupulous
fellows
were
hanging
around
this
region
and
meaning
to
steal
his
pets
when
they
got
half
a
chance
that
was
why
he
wanted
to
watch
and
make
sure
we
did
belong
to
the
same
crowd
oh
yes
a
likely
story
too
continued
with
a
sneer
why
should
anybody
want
to
rob
a
poor
boy
who
was
trying
to
earn
his
living
by
farming
even
if
it
was
furs
he
raised
instead
of
grain
or
hogs
or
stock
why
you
poor
ninny
the
reason
is
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
and
that
not
invisible
by
a
big
sight
when
a
black
fox
pelt
will
fetch
a
thousand
dollars
more
or
less
and
ca
well
be
traced
once
it
gets
mixed
with
other
pelts
it
stands
to
reason
that
any
thief
would
want
to
steal
it
as
to
your
doubting
that
there
are
any
other
people
up
in
this
section
you
seem
to
forget
that
around
noon
today
we
sighted
a
plain
smoke
some
miles
away
which
we
opined
must
have
been
made
by
some
advance
hunters
waiting
for
the
law
to
be
off
deer
well
why
could
it
have
been
the
people
obed
says
he
fears
who
made
that
smoke
now
for
my
part
i
believe
every
word
obed
grimes
said
he
the
straight
goods
every
time
and
you
can
see
it
in
his
eye
for
he
looks
you
direct
in
the
face
thereupon
as
though
realizing
that
he
had
raised
a
nest
about
his
ears
deemed
it
the
part
of
discretion
to
shrug
his
shoulders
after
the
manner
of
one
who
convinced
against
his
will
is
of
the
same
opinion
still
we
let
the
subject
drop
steve
he
said
hastily
it
ai
worth
quarreling
over
the
proof
of
the
pudding
is
in
the
eating
of
it
and
tomorrow
we
what
what
but
remember
if
it
turns
out
that
we
been
bamboozled
do
blame
me
because
i
warned
you
all
if
we
had
a
chill
from
every
warning
you
sprung
on
us
steve
told
him
witheringly
why
say
we
have
gone
all
to
pieces
long
before
now
you
a
regular
old
prognosticator
what
you
are
that
right
get
to
calling
names
it
a
habit
with
people
who
know
they
are
in
the
wrong
grumbled
but
nevertheless
he
drew
within
his
shell
and
said
nothing
further
about
obed
grimes
or
his
suspicions
concerning
the
same
chapter
v
packing
over
the
carry
later
on
the
conversation
began
to
lag
steve
was
noticed
drowsily
nodding
his
head
in
a
suggestive
way
and
then
after
a
sudden
start
he
would
look
around
aggressively
as
if
to
remark
who
said
i
was
sleepy
but
within
three
minutes
he
would
be
at
it
again
in
fact
all
of
the
boys
were
really
tired
out
the
day
tramp
had
been
a
difficult
one
even
for
fellows
accustomed
to
such
things
and
those
regular
adirondack
packs
with
a
band
crossing
the
forehead
in
the
usual
way
had
seemed
doubly
heavy
before
they
decided
to
stop
for
the
night
of
course
there
were
sounds
to
be
heard
all
around
them
but
familiarity
breeds
contempt
and
from
max
down
they
were
all
accustomed
to
hearing
similar
noises
whenever
they
spent
nights
in
the
open
the
owl
would
whinny
or
hoot
according
to
his
species
the
loon
send
forth
his
agonizing
and
weird
shriek
from
some
distant
lake
a
fox
might
bark
sharply
and
fretfully
or
two
quarrelsome
dispute
over
a
bit
of
food
they
had
discovered
all
this
went
with
the
camping
business
and
indeed
it
would
have
seemed
odd
to
those
boys
had
the
usual
accompaniment
been
missing
well
what
the
use
of
our
staying
up
longer
max
finally
announced
in
an
authoritative
fashion
after
steve
had
almost
jerked
his
neck
awry
for
about
the
seventh
time
with
one
of
those
spasmodic
movements
our
blankets
are
calling
to
us
boys
let
turn
in
there
was
no
negative
vote
recorded
for
every
one
seemed
ready
to
call
it
a
day
and
quit
max
took
it
upon
himself
to
look
after
the
fire
plenty
of
wood
had
been
gathered
to
last
until
morning
and
then
some
for
as
the
night
air
was
beginning
to
feel
pretty
sharp
it
was
concluded
to
keep
the
fire
going
i
look
out
for
that
part
said
max
i
generally
wake
up
just
so
many
times
during
the
night
when
i
in
camp
and
it
no
trouble
for
me
to
crawl
out
and
toss
another
stick
on
the
fire
so
forget
it
fellows
will
you
apparently
the
others
took
him
at
his
word
for
not
another
sign
of
any
of
them
was
seen
while
night
lasted
once
they
snuggled
down
in
their
warm
comfortable
blankets
they
must
have
become
dead
to
the
world
as
steve
aptly
termed
it
several
times
while
the
night
held
sway
a
figure
would
crawl
noiselessly
out
of
the
crude
brush
shanty
shelter
and
place
another
lot
of
wood
upon
the
dwindling
fire
thus
keeping
it
going
for
another
spell
of
several
hours
of
course
this
was
max
who
really
liked
to
take
an
observation
concerning
the
state
of
the
weather
note
the
changed
positions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
so
that
he
could
figure
on
the
passage
of
time
and
then
once
more
creep
into
the
folds
of
his
blanket
to
again
fall
into
a
deep
sleep
so
the
night
passed
nothing
occurred
to
disturb
its
serenity
the
little
woods
folks
doubtless
prowled
all
around
the
boys
camp
eyeing
the
glimmering
fire
with
wonder
and
distrust
for
it
could
not
be
a
familiar
sight
to
any
of
them
since
mankind
seldom
visited
this
inaccessible
region
so
far
removed
from
the
track
of
ordinary
travel
some
of
the
more
daring
among
them
venturesome
or
perhaps
may
even
have
invaded
the
precincts
of
the
charmed
circle
searching
with
their
keen
little
noses
for
traces
of
castaway
food
but
if
so
their
presence
did
not
disturb
the
sleepers
within
that
shelter
so
morning
came
on
apace
and
presently
from
the
brush
shanty
one
after
another
of
the
fellows
came
creeping
forth
to
stretch
and
yawn
and
finally
hasten
their
dressing
for
the
frosty
air
nipped
fingers
and
toes
quite
lustily
they
were
in
no
particular
hurry
and
breakfast
therefore
was
undertaken
in
the
best
of
humor
with
plenty
of
time
given
to
its
preparation
everybody
seemed
to
be
in
the
best
of
humors
and
his
good
sleep
must
have
smoothed
even
the
spirit
of
the
fretful
for
he
no
longer
grumbled
or
found
fault
perhaps
as
so
frequently
happened
he
was
secretly
ashamed
of
having
shown
such
a
suspicious
and
argumentative
disposition
on
the
preceding
evening
and
meant
to
make
amends
for
it
by
an
unusually
cheery
manner
it
was
determined
to
break
camp
soon
after
the
matin
meal
had
been
comfortably
dispatched
this
did
not
promise
to
be
an
extraordinary
feat
since
they
were
trying
to
go
on
this
expedition
and
did
not
have
many
of
their
ordinary
traps
along
from
a
tent
down
to
certain
cooking
utensils
that
had
been
deemed
too
heavy
for
toting
mile
after
mile
into
the
wilderness
it
makes
a
whole
lot
of
difference
just
how
fellows
mean
to
go
when
laying
out
the
impedimenta
for
a
trip
if
a
wagon
or
a
boat
is
available
all
sorts
of
things
may
as
well
be
taken
along
so
as
to
insure
the
maximum
of
comfort
but
when
it
is
known
in
the
beginning
that
all
they
are
meaning
to
use
must
be
packed
every
mile
of
the
way
on
the
back
of
the
campers
then
it
is
high
time
to
cut
down
the
list
to
the
last
fraction
so
far
as
weight
and
bulk
are
concerned
max
and
his
chums
had
reduced
this
down
to
a
real
science
for
instance
having
a
comfortable
balance
at
the
bank
thanks
to
their
thrift
in
the
past
money
did
not
enter
into
their
calculations
at
all
consequently
they
had
purchased
a
complete
little
outfit
of
aluminum
cooking
vessels
that
nested
within
each
other
and
weighed
next
to
nothing
while
offering
all
the
advantages
of
ordinary
granite
ware
other
campers
comforts
too
had
been
secured
so
that
they
even
carried
a
certain
amount
of
condensed
food
in
the
shape
of
milk
powder
evaporated
eggs
that
could
be
used
to
make
excellent
omelets
in
case
of
necessity
and
even
soup
in
double
cans
with
a
layer
of
unslacked
lime
between
which
by
the
addition
of
a
little
water
to
the
lime
could
be
heated
up
beautifully
without
the
aid
of
a
fire
in
camp
on
the
big
sunflower
when
all
of
them
started
in
to
get
busy
things
quickly
assumed
a
concentrated
condition
each
article
had
its
regular
place
where
it
would
take
up
the
least
possible
space
why
by
now
every
fellow
had
found
out
just
how
to
do
up
his
pack
so
that
no
sharp
and
uncomfortable
edges
would
cut
into
his
back
and
when
this
condition
has
been
reached
it
means
that
the
last
word
in
packing
has
been
learned
max
himself
saw
to
it
that
the
fire
was
effectually
killed
before
they
quitted
the
scene
of
their
night
encampment
this
he
did
by
throwing
water
on
the
hissing
embers
until
it
was
quite
dead
if
every
party
that
spends
a
night
in
the
wilderness
took
the
same
pains
to
put
out
their
fire
on
leaving
many
a
magnificent
stretch
of
timber
would
be
spared
from
the
ravages
of
a
forest
fire
that
leaves
only
blackened
tree
trunks
behind
and
ruins
thousands
of
acres
of
wooded
land
every
year
although
a
fire
may
die
down
and
seem
to
have
little
life
in
it
there
is
no
absolute
surety
unless
water
be
used
that
a
rising
wind
may
not
fan
the
embers
into
renewed
activity
until
a
dangerous
spark
is
carried
into
some
nest
of
dead
leaves
near
by
and
so
the
fire
starts
that
can
seldom
control
three
miles
he
said
up
this
stream
observed
as
they
started
gaily
forth
max
in
the
lead
and
toby
bringing
up
the
rear
and
as
no
doubt
the
said
stream
meanders
considerably
in
its
course
that
might
mean
only
half
the
distance
as
the
crow
flies
remarked
the
leader
turning
once
more
to
look
back
toward
the
deserted
camp
after
the
fashion
of
a
carpenter
who
considers
it
wise
to
measure
his
post
before
applying
the
saw
because
after
the
deed
is
done
the
parts
can
never
be
put
together
again
but
everything
seemed
still
and
not
the
faintest
whisp
of
smoke
crept
lazily
upward
from
the
late
they
walked
along
for
a
short
distance
and
then
upon
crossing
a
little
rise
in
order
to
skirt
a
bad
section
of
marshy
ground
it
was
discovered
that
they
had
a
good
chance
to
look
backward
a
rather
pretty
view
rewarded
their
efforts
and
as
all
the
boys
appreciated
nature
in
her
fall
dress
they
stood
for
a
minute
drinking
this
in
you
can
follow
the
course
of
the
stream
for
quite
a
distance
notice
remarked
and
i
even
see
the
place
where
we
yanked
steve
here
out
of
that
sand
steve
frowned
as
he
looked
and
max
could
see
that
he
had
gone
a
little
white
the
memory
of
his
harrowed
feelings
on
that
occasion
would
stay
with
steve
for
quite
some
time
and
produce
an
unpleasant
sensation
every
time
it
came
before
his
mental
vision
max
also
saw
him
shut
his
teeth
very
hard
together
and
was
close
enough
to
even
catch
a
word
or
two
the
boy
muttered
savagely
to
himself
never
again
from
that
max
could
judge
the
lesson
had
been
impressed
on
steve
mind
indelibly
and
that
as
long
as
he
lived
he
would
be
careful
how
he
entered
an
unknown
stream
when
fishing
and
especially
how
he
became
so
engrossed
in
his
sport
as
to
stand
a
length
of
time
in
one
spot
without
working
his
feet
up
and
down
so
as
to
make
sure
they
were
free
from
clinging
sand
they
chatted
from
time
to
time
as
they
proceeded
and
of
course
all
sorts
of
subjects
cropped
up
to
be
discussed
sometimes
there
was
a
little
dispute
concerning
something
or
other
for
boys
have
different
minds
and
are
apt
to
view
things
from
various
angles
but
as
time
passed
they
made
such
good
progress
that
max
presently
announced
his
belief
they
must
presently
glimpse
the
seven
birch
trees
mentioned
by
obed
grimes
as
marking
the
place
where
they
were
to
quit
the
bank
of
the
stream
at
the
time
they
stopped
to
look
backward
max
had
scanned
the
country
behind
them
looking
for
some
trace
of
another
camp
smoke
but
seeing
fond
of
working
his
way
and
often
slipped
out
of
things
when
he
could
manage
it
some
fellows
always
do
get
hold
of
the
smaller
end
of
the
log
that
is
being
carried
as
if
by
instinct
though
it
would
be
hardly
fair
to
call
them
shirkers
they
rested
for
something
like
ten
minutes
then
max
started
up
here
the
trail
obed
told
us
about
he
observed
pointing
down
at
his
feet
as
though
he
had
been
looking
about
him
while
recuperating
after
that
three
mile
carry
and
i
guess
we
might
as
well
be
going
on
for
one
i
beginning
to
feel
quite
curious
to
see
that
lodge
of
his
under
the
pines
and
hemlocks
as
well
as
learn
what
he
is
doing
with
his
fox
farm
opened
his
mouth
and
then
considered
it
better
not
to
voice
the
question
he
had
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
for
he
shut
his
jaws
tight
together
again
and
did
not
speak
max
noticing
this
it
caused
him
to
smile
in
quiet
satisfaction
that
was
a
very
disagreeable
habit
of
always
questioning
things
and
wanting
double
proof
before
he
would
put
the
stamp
of
his
approval
on
them
and
max
kept
hoping
that
in
the
process
of
time
it
could
be
broken
up
it
was
not
difficult
to
follow
the
trail
even
though
at
times
this
proved
to
be
rather
faint
and
undecided
at
least
it
turned
out
to
be
an
easy
task
with
the
four
chums
simply
because
they
were
accustomed
to
such
things
a
greenhorn
might
have
lost
the
track
many
times
and
made
a
none
he
had
in
mind
the
story
told
by
obed
concerning
the
presence
in
the
vicinity
of
another
party
and
his
suspicions
concerning
their
base
intentions
apparently
max
must
have
believed
what
the
woods
boy
said
even
though
he
could
see
no
sign
of
a
camp
that
morning
i
got
an
idea
the
seven
birches
are
just
over
yonder
boys
announced
steve
who
possessed
good
eyesight
twice
now
i
glimpsed
something
white
among
the
thickets
of
undergrowth
and
you
can
see
that
the
creek
is
beginning
to
swing
around
so
as
to
lead
us
in
that
direction
you
about
steve
declared
toby
jucklin
instantly
to
you
the
i
been
squinting
that
same
of
white
myself
some
little
time
now
it
turned
out
to
be
just
as
steve
had
prophesied
they
soon
discovered
a
bunch
of
birches
growing
from
the
stump
of
a
larger
tree
that
had
long
ago
fallen
under
the
ax
of
a
woodsman
there
are
seven
all
right
count
announced
steve
with
a
vein
of
exultation
in
his
voice
just
as
though
by
right
of
discovery
those
birches
really
belonged
to
him
let
call
a
little
rest
before
we
tackle
the
last
round
begged
as
they
arrived
alongside
the
landmark
mentioned
by
obed
and
without
waiting
for
the
others
to
assent
he
dropped
his
pack
and
threw
himself
down
on
an
especially
inviting
bit
of
moss
heaving
a
great
sigh
of
relief
for
be
it
known
was
not
especially
mountain
out
of
a
as
steve
aptly
put
it
when
referring
to
the
matter
soon
they
were
casting
eager
glances
ahead
under
the
impression
that
they
must
certainly
be
drawing
near
the
object
of
their
search
even
had
by
now
apparently
arrived
at
the
belief
that
obed
was
straight
and
that
he
really
did
have
some
sort
of
home
in
this
secluded
region
the
directions
had
turned
out
to
be
exact
from
the
tramp
along
the
stream
and
the
seven
birches
count
to
the
winding
trail
that
led
from
that
point
deeper
into
the
woods
looky
there
is
that
some
sort
of
high
wire
fence
demanded
steve
suddenly
and
say
i
got
a
plain
whiff
of
sweet
hickory
wood
smoke
then
believe
me
added
in
some
excitement
and
evidently
forgetting
that
not
long
before
he
had
been
skeptical
regarding
the
existence
of
any
lodge
or
fox
farm
well
there
the
answer
right
before
you
laughed
max
and
as
they
stared
in
the
direction
their
leader
was
pointing
the
balance
of
the
little
party
saw
what
seemed
to
be
the
cutest
little
cabin
fashioned
from
sawn
logs
and
nestling
in
a
happy
fashion
directly
under
the
clustering
pines
and
hemlocks
that
hung
over
it
most
protectingly
as
though
with
the
intention
of
keeping
the
winter
snows
from
weighing
down
the
sloping
roof
at
one
end
was
a
chimney
made
of
slabs
of
wood
with
the
chinks
filled
in
with
mud
that
in
the
process
of
time
aided
by
the
heat
of
the
fire
had
become
as
hard
as
cement
or
adamant
and
from
this
there
curled
wreaths
of
lazily
ascending
blue
smoke
the
source
of
that
delightful
odor
that
had
drifted
to
nostrils
chapter
vi
the
lodge
of
many
wonders
there
obed
right
now
waving
at
us
from
the
doorway
of
his
cabin
announced
steve
even
as
they
looked
at
the
picture
made
by
the
little
log
structure
nestling
so
cozily
under
the
dark
foliage
of
the
resinous
trees
that
never
lost
their
green
look
even
when
snow
covered
the
mountains
to
the
depth
of
several
feet
they
hurried
forward
to
join
the
owner
of
the
woods
lodge
who
had
evidently
expected
them
to
put
in
an
appearance
about
this
time
of
day
figuring
just
when
they
would
break
camp
and
how
long
it
would
take
them
to
make
the
carry
he
shook
hands
with
each
of
his
friends
in
turn
and
warmly
too
even
seemed
to
feel
that
his
unworthy
suspicions
of
the
other
could
have
no
foundation
to
judge
from
the
hearty
way
in
which
he
greeted
obed
max
was
quick
to
see
that
obed
looked
pleased
at
their
coming
he
also
wondered
why
the
other
seemed
to
raise
his
eyebrows
now
and
then
and
smile
as
though
certain
thoughts
he
entertained
were
quite
amusing
but
then
seeing
what
a
lonely
life
the
young
fur
farmer
must
be
leading
so
far
away
from
his
kind
and
wrapped
up
in
his
singular
calling
after
all
it
was
not
so
queer
that
he
should
act
in
this
way
upon
having
visitors
and
boys
of
his
own
age
in
the
bargain
they
were
ushered
inside
the
lodge
and
here
another
surprise
greeted
them
max
in
particular
was
astonished
to
find
that
the
small
building
contained
so
much
in
the
way
of
comforts
if
he
had
thought
of
the
matter
at
all
he
probably
expected
to
find
just
an
ordinary
shack
such
as
nine
boys
in
ten
would
be
contented
with
building
and
that
obed
was
putting
up
with
all
sorts
of
discomforts
the
contrary
proved
to
be
the
truth
for
there
were
numerous
things
in
sight
to
cause
a
visitor
to
express
surprise
why
obed
even
used
cooking
equal
to
theirs
though
not
meant
for
camping
particularly
there
were
several
rocking
chairs
and
one
big
fireside
chair
that
looked
mighty
inviting
indeed
as
it
flanked
the
broad
hearth
where
obed
had
a
blaze
going
the
kitchen
lay
at
the
back
and
actually
had
a
wood
stove
in
it
capable
of
baking
bread
or
biscuits
on
occasion
water
too
had
been
piped
to
the
cabin
from
some
spring
farther
up
the
rise
though
in
the
dead
of
winter
a
supply
must
of
necessity
be
obtained
from
some
other
source
since
this
would
be
frozen
up
these
things
and
many
others
along
the
same
line
caused
max
to
survey
obed
with
a
new
source
of
wonder
who
was
this
remarkable
boy
and
how
on
earth
did
he
come
to
possess
such
a
magical
lodge
up
here
in
the
unpeopled
wilderness
why
a
rich
man
could
hardly
have
surrounded
himself
with
more
in
the
way
of
comforts
and
yet
according
to
his
language
and
his
account
of
himself
obed
was
only
an
ordinary
child
of
the
woods
one
of
the
very
numerous
grimes
tribe
many
of
whom
doubtless
gained
their
living
by
serving
as
guides
in
season
max
after
staring
around
him
in
due
wonder
and
admiration
turned
again
to
obed
he
could
see
that
the
other
was
observing
them
with
that
merry
twinkle
in
his
eyes
and
evidently
expecting
his
guests
to
express
amazement
at
finding
so
wonderful
a
habitation
where
they
had
anticipated
so
little
its
just
splendid
that
the
only
word
i
can
find
to
express
my
feelings
obed
max
hastened
to
say
at
which
the
other
laughed
aloud
course
now
are
awonderin
jest
how
a
poor
woods
boy
like
me
ever
git
hold
o
such
a
clever
cabin
he
went
on
to
say
but
shucks
that
an
easy
one
to
explain
yuh
see
it
was
built
by
a
man
who
had
plenty
o
money
and
poor
health
he
thought
he
could
get
well
by
stayin
here
and
so
he
fixed
her
up
to
beat
the
band
that
big
chair
he
loved
to
sit
in
when
the
fire
was
agoin
but
jest
as
he
got
fixed
so
nice
his
wife
sent
for
him
to
come
back
home
and
say
he
had
to
go
so
havin
no
use
for
his
place
here
he
turned
it
over
tuh
me
for
a
song
i
show
yuh
the
bill
o
sale
yuh
see
i
got
to
know
coombs
right
well
for
he
was
interested
in
my
ijee
o
startin
a
fur
farm
well
he
dead
now
i
often
think
when
i
sittin
here
enjoyin
what
he
built
that
somehow
his
spirit
must
be
a
hoverin
around
cause
he
certainly
love
this
place
a
heap
the
explanation
entirely
satisfied
max
though
of
course
that
skeptic
of
a
had
to
let
his
eyebrows
go
up
in
an
arch
as
he
listened
but
then
would
doubt
anything
that
savored
of
the
uncommon
max
simply
frowned
at
him
and
paid
no
more
attention
to
his
manner
you
were
certainly
mighty
lucky
to
fall
heir
to
such
a
lovely
little
home
as
this
obed
steve
was
saying
with
a
streak
of
envy
in
his
voice
say
i
just
be
tickled
half
to
death
now
if
i
could
spend
a
month
up
here
with
you
there
must
be
plenty
of
game
around
i
reckon
and
it
be
a
real
delight
to
keep
house
in
a
little
palace
like
this
but
how
are
you
going
to
tuck
us
away
for
the
night
obed
if
i
might
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
seeing
that
as
yet
we
have
had
an
invite
to
stay
over
oh
that
easily
managed
replied
the
other
with
another
of
his
queer
laughs
you
have
begun
to
see
all
the
wonders
o
this
lodge
coombs
amused
himself
for
a
whole
summer
havin
it
built
he
put
a
heap
o
his
own
ijees
into
the
same
too
yuh
see
he
used
to
be
a
sea
captain
once
on
a
time
and
that
gave
him
the
notion
to
have
tables
that
folded
against
the
wall
so
as
tuh
take
mighty
little
room
then
seem
as
how
he
might
expect
to
have
company
some
time
or
other
look
how
he
fixed
the
bunks
along
the
walls
with
that
obed
turned
a
button
that
none
of
them
had
thus
far
noticed
fastened
on
the
wall
immediately
a
section
slipped
down
exposing
a
cavity
beyond
that
proved
to
be
a
regular
sleeping
bunk
fully
capable
of
housing
any
ordinary
person
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
his
sea
education
had
given
coombs
the
idea
carried
out
in
this
remarkable
fashion
beats
anything
i
ever
struck
admitted
the
admiring
steve
as
he
pushed
forward
to
peep
inside
the
cavity
that
seemed
to
offer
such
a
comfortable
bed
but
hardly
big
enough
for
the
whole
bunch
of
us
i
afraid
obed
urged
with
the
idea
of
course
of
drawing
the
other
out
this
is
one
bunk
said
obed
calmly
there
are
three
jest
like
it
along
the
two
walls
makin
four
in
all
so
yuh
see
it
jest
like
coombs
he
figgered
on
my
having
stop
over
with
me
some
fine
day
then
i
make
up
a
bed
on
that
couch
which
is
softer
any
o
the
bunks
used
to
sleep
on
it
all
the
time
did
mr
coombs
well
i
must
say
this
is
a
revelation
to
me
admitted
max
his
face
showing
how
pleased
he
felt
and
you
were
lucky
as
steve
here
just
said
to
fall
in
with
such
a
fine
man
as
coombs
at
the
time
you
started
your
fur
farm
i
suppose
it
was
the
interest
he
took
in
it
that
made
him
hand
over
this
cabin
when
he
learned
that
his
plans
for
staying
here
could
never
be
carried
out
why
yes
mostly
that
agreed
obed
turning
a
little
red
i
ought
to
tell
yuh
that
i
chanced
to
do
coombs
a
little
favor
when
we
first
met
yuh
see
i
happened
to
come
on
him
in
the
woods
he
started
out
to
find
a
certain
kind
o
sapling
that
he
wanted
right
bad
to
use
and
not
bein
used
to
findin
his
way
around
he
jest
naturally
got
lost
but
that
was
the
wust
o
it
in
using
his
ax
to
chop
down
a
sapling
he
kim
across
what
did
he
do
but
cut
his
foot
and
it
was
bleeding
like
fun
when
i
ketched
his
shouts
and
kim
up
course
i
soon
fixed
that
foot
and
since
he
was
only
a
little
speck
o
a
man
i
managed
to
tote
him
on
my
back
most
ways
home
here
he
chose
to
think
i
done
him
a
favor
and
after
that
he
was
always
sayin
he
meant
to
repay
me
some
day
well
he
certainly
did
when
he
turns
over
this
here
neat
contraption
at
a
price
that
was
dirt
cheap
and
which
be
ashamed
to
mention
to
yuh
that
how
it
come
i
got
this
cabin
how
simple
the
explanation
was
after
all
and
how
must
feel
his
cheeks
burn
with
shame
at
the
thought
of
having
suspected
this
same
obed
of
trying
to
deceive
them
max
could
easily
picture
the
captain
seated
in
that
capacious
fireside
chair
with
the
tufted
cushion
and
perhaps
smoking
his
pipe
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
believed
he
had
found
what
he
had
long
sought
peace
and
comfort
combined
only
to
have
a
summons
come
that
he
dared
not
disobey
make
yourselves
to
hum
said
obed
cheerily
here
drop
the
packs
over
in
this
corner
if
later
on
so
be
yuh
want
to
git
anything
out
the
same
it
be
easy
done
and
seein
as
i
got
dinner
started
i
guess
we
wont
take
a
turn
around
the
farm
till
it
been
stowed
away
although
of
course
all
of
the
boys
were
eager
to
see
what
a
fur
farm
looked
like
where
those
wonderful
black
foxes
that
brought
such
a
big
price
in
the
london
markets
were
being
bred
in
captivity
none
of
them
objected
to
sitting
down
and
taking
a
rest
and
steve
in
particular
made
a
bolt
for
the
big
chair
though
the
latter
was
too
quick
for
his
competitor
and
managed
to
ensconce
himself
within
its
capacious
embrace
before
arrived
start
earlier
next
time
crowed
the
proud
possessor
of
the
coveted
seat
as
he
spread
himself
so
as
to
occupy
it
all
but
after
i
tried
it
out
i
vacate
because
i
expect
to
get
busy
in
that
bully
little
kitchen
and
help
friend
obed
sling
the
grub
for
dinner
so
had
to
content
himself
with
a
seat
on
the
couch
he
might
have
been
observed
sniffing
the
air
with
avidity
however
as
though
he
had
caught
some
enticing
odor
stealing
out
of
the
oven
of
the
cook
stove
that
was
not
unlike
fresh
bread
being
well
browned
and
there
was
nothing
loved
better
than
the
crust
part
of
a
fresh
baking
he
always
had
a
compact
with
the
cook
at
home
to
save
him
the
portions
which
he
looked
upon
as
a
prize
well
worth
having
soon
obed
left
them
there
in
the
larger
room
and
vanished
within
the
kitchen
it
was
a
challenge
to
steve
which
he
could
not
long
resist
kept
watching
him
glance
toward
the
connecting
doors
his
whole
manner
was
that
of
a
boy
who
although
making
no
sound
might
be
sicking
one
dog
on
another
no
sooner
had
steve
left
the
capacious
fireside
chair
than
slipped
into
it
and
after
that
he
was
not
meaning
to
be
dislodged
until
the
summons
came
to
gather
about
the
table
to
discuss
the
midday
meal
liked
eating
as
well
as
the
next
one
but
he
loved
his
ease
more
and
was
well
content
to
have
some
other
fellow
do
the
hard
work
of
getting
the
meal
ready
his
time
would
come
when
he
had
to
work
his
jaws
in
disposing
of
his
portion
of
the
spread
the
more
max
looked
about
him
the
greater
his
wonder
became
all
manner
of
thoughts
surged
through
that
active
mind
of
his
he
had
already
conceived
the
greatest
sort
of
secret
admiration
for
the
extraordinary
woods
boy
even
before
he
had
glimpsed
that
remarkable
fur
farm
which
the
other
was
successfully
running
plainly
then
this
same
obed
grimes
was
bound
to
be
a
credit
to
his
family
and
all
those
people
bearing
the
strange
names
given
by
obed
would
some
day
find
cause
to
feel
proud
of
having
such
an
enterprising
relative
obed
proved
to
be
a
pretty
good
cook
despite
the
humility
with
which
he
had
remarked
that
of
course
he
could
not
expect
to
compete
on
even
terms
with
fellows
who
had
had
so
many
better
opportunities
to
acquire
the
knack
of
things
than
had
come
his
way
the
bread
was
as
fine
as
any
had
ever
eaten
in
his
own
home
where
a
cook
held
sway
over
the
kitchen
there
was
also
a
meat
pie
that
seemed
delicious
both
as
to
crust
and
contents
when
opened
though
obed
them
that
it
was
made
of
canned
beef
and
even
displayed
the
recent
tin
jacket
with
its
telltale
label
as
confirmation
to
his
assertion
yuh
see
boys
he
remarked
laughingly
i
do
want
yuh
to
think
poach
a
deer
in
the
close
season
and
palm
it
off
as
mountain
mutton
like
they
do
at
some
o
the
big
hotels
up
here
in
the
adirondacks
told
course
i
do
shoot
a
deer
once
in
a
while
in
season
and
lots
they
bein
so
tame
yuh
knock
them
over
as
they
sit
on
the
lower
limb
o
a
tree
after
flushin
i
ketch
wheens
o
trout
too
from
time
to
time
but
i
give
yuh
my
word
i
never
yet
killed
anything
when
the
law
was
on
it
never
when
obed
said
a
thing
in
his
emphatic
way
he
was
to
be
relied
on
max
thought
the
woods
boy
could
look
very
sober
at
times
though
as
a
rule
there
was
that
merry
gleam
in
his
eye
that
told
how
much
he
loved
a
joke
altogether
they
had
a
delightful
meal
and
what
was
even
better
there
was
an
abundance
to
give
every
one
three
bountiful
helpings
which
fact
pleased
and
steve
in
particular
the
former
on
passing
his
plate
for
they
actually
had
such
articles
at
this
wonderful
lodge
under
the
pines
for
the
third
help
excused
himself
by
remarking
aside
it
queer
what
a
appetite
toting
a
pack
a
few
miles
over
a
carry
gives
a
fellow
now
at
home
i
generally
satisfied
with
one
portion
but
once
let
me
get
into
the
harness
and
i
seem
to
have
no
end
of
say
i
eat
you
out
of
house
and
home
obed
if
i
stayed
very
long
at
your
ranch
no
danger
o
that
i
guess
replied
the
other
for
he
had
of
course
taken
quite
naturally
to
calling
these
new
friends
by
their
customary
names
just
as
boys
always
do
get
on
quick
terms
of
familiarity
last
time
i
went
to
town
i
laid
in
quite
a
wheen
o
stuff
then
there
always
the
crick
to
git
trout
outen
and
in
a
short
time
you
could
shoot
without
breakin
the
game
laws
so
do
let
that
worry
yuh
any
i
too
tickled
to
have
some
fellers
around
it
does
git
kinder
lonely
here
sometimes
i
own
up
whew
i
should
think
it
would
obed
said
steve
lost
in
admiration
for
the
amazing
nerve
displayed
by
the
woods
boy
in
remaining
all
by
himself
winter
and
summer
seldom
if
ever
seeing
a
human
face
and
apparently
devoting
all
his
energies
to
making
his
fur
farm
experiment
turn
out
to
be
a
success
nothing
would
tempt
me
to
stick
it
out
here
a
whole
winter
why
i
die
of
the
blues
and
let
the
black
foxes
go
to
the
dickens
while
i
made
break
for
the
nearest
town
so
i
could
hear
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
obed
looked
at
him
gravely
and
heaved
a
sigh
yep
i
feels
that
ways
too
sometimes
steve
he
said
presently
and
let
me
tell
yuh
the
temptation
is
nigh
more
i
stand
but
i
jest
shuts
my
teeth
together
and
tells
myself
that
i
started
in
to
do
this
job
and
i
agoin
to
stick
it
out
or
know
the
reason
why
then
i
git
my
second
wind
agin
and
it
all
right
once
i
used
to
give
in
right
easy
but
i
broke
now
o
that
bad
habit
i
guess
chapter
vii
the
young
magician
the
more
max
listened
to
obed
talk
on
the
one
subject
that
seemed
to
be
his
pet
hobby
that
of
raising
valuable
animals
for
the
market
the
deeper
grew
his
conviction
that
the
woods
boy
was
well
worth
studying
he
might
talk
after
the
manner
of
an
uneducated
boy
but
max
knew
that
this
could
not
be
the
case
even
though
the
main
lot
of
numerous
grimeses
were
following
the
humble
occupation
of
guides
amidst
the
extensive
stretches
of
the
adirondacks
and
possibly
many
of
them
would
be
found
to
be
boors
save
along
the
line
of
woodcraft
obed
had
managed
to
pick
up
considerable
knowledge
somehow
or
other
when
trying
to
explain
how
this
idea
of
successfully
raising
silver
black
foxes
took
such
a
main
grip
on
his
imagination
he
brought
out
a
batch
of
clippings
which
he
had
managed
to
get
hold
of
in
some
manner
max
could
not
even
guess
how
some
of
these
were
fantastic
in
their
revelations
while
others
were
authentic
interviews
with
parties
who
for
years
had
been
secretly
engaged
in
the
business
of
fur
farming
this
was
away
up
on
prince
edward
island
beyond
nova
scotia
said
to
be
the
place
best
situated
geographically
for
the
purpose
as
these
animals
require
a
severe
climate
in
order
that
their
pelt
assumes
its
richest
and
heaviest
crop
a
black
fox
farm
started
down
in
florida
would
not
produce
furs
worth
offering
for
sale
max
was
intensely
interested
with
one
account
in
particular
connected
with
the
extensive
pioneer
silver
fox
ranch
he
even
asked
the
privilege
of
copying
the
same
for
future
reference
because
he
knew
that
statements
he
might
make
later
on
would
be
skeptically
received
by
many
people
who
had
never
dreamed
that
any
species
of
furs
were
so
valuable
that
young
pups
could
be
worth
more
than
their
weight
in
gold
that
the
boy
reader
of
this
story
may
also
stock
up
with
information
that
will
better
enable
him
to
understand
what
enterprising
obed
grimes
was
trying
to
do
on
a
small
scale
i
am
tempted
to
give
the
main
items
in
this
newspaper
article
every
word
of
which
is
said
to
be
literally
true
since
this
account
was
first
printed
some
years
ago
other
farms
along
similar
lines
have
been
started
away
up
near
calgary
in
the
canadian
province
of
alberta
and
are
said
to
be
doing
excellently
one
ranch
near
midnapore
reporting
a
start
with
twelve
pair
and
the
pack
now
counting
in
all
but
here
is
the
main
part
of
the
clipping
well
worth
reading
there
is
something
novel
about
a
ranch
which
consists
of
spaces
covering
feet
of
ground
chappell
now
president
of
the
sydney
chamber
of
commerce
nova
scotia
owns
seventy
pairs
of
silver
black
foxes
and
his
ranch
is
split
up
into
small
inclosures
of
that
size
covered
with
wire
on
four
sides
the
wire
being
buried
four
feet
under
ground
attached
to
a
concrete
base
and
turned
in
several
feet
the
silver
black
fox
tries
to
root
its
way
to
freedom
and
this
is
the
way
the
breeder
prevents
his
escape
when
the
foxes
mate
we
also
mate
a
pair
of
black
cats
of
the
ordinary
domestic
variety
as
soon
as
the
young
are
born
we
take
the
fox
pups
away
from
the
mother
fox
and
the
kittens
away
from
the
mother
cat
and
make
the
cat
to
the
fox
cubs
in
this
way
we
are
able
to
rear
a
more
domesticated
breed
of
foxes
for
twenty
years
this
business
of
raising
foxes
of
the
silver
black
species
was
really
kept
under
cover
because
of
its
great
possibilities
for
making
big
money
with
the
last
four
or
five
years
the
business
has
become
organized
and
today
many
millions
of
dollars
are
invested
in
it
the
last
lot
of
animals
slaughtered
was
in
there
were
pelts
sent
to
london
at
that
time
they
brought
as
high
as
the
average
fetching
silver
black
fox
is
the
rarest
fur
utilized
by
man
the
russian
sable
otter
and
south
sea
seal
are
practically
eliminated
for
commercial
purposes
due
to
international
laws
which
prohibit
the
killing
of
these
animals
for
the
next
ten
or
fifteen
years
so
as
to
give
them
a
chance
to
increase
only
pairs
of
live
foxes
were
placed
on
sale
last
year
fewer
than
of
that
number
were
killed
and
their
fur
sold
the
rest
went
for
breeding
purposes
because
fur
farms
are
starting
up
in
many
favorable
places
the
men
who
raise
silver
foxes
on
prince
edward
island
know
the
game
they
started
in
it
as
boys
many
years
ago
in
the
provinces
of
prince
edward
nova
scotia
and
new
brunswick
men
and
women
interested
in
breeding
foxes
have
been
made
wealthy
they
were
poor
people
ten
years
ago
today
they
live
in
town
houses
own
their
own
automobiles
and
yet
continue
to
give
the
strictest
attention
to
all
the
details
connected
with
their
singular
farming
industry
obed
was
extremely
modest
in
what
he
told
concerning
his
own
small
beginning
max
having
also
read
in
one
of
the
clippings
that
a
pair
of
silver
black
foxes
were
worth
all
the
way
up
to
was
of
course
doubly
curious
to
learn
whether
those
with
which
obed
started
could
be
the
genuine
article
and
if
so
how
had
he
managed
to
obtain
them
it
seemed
to
be
only
a
game
in
which
rich
persons
could
enter
obed
understood
just
what
must
be
passing
in
the
mind
of
the
other
and
at
the
first
opportunity
he
hastened
to
explain
i
was
just
chock
full
o
this
business
he
went
on
to
say
when
i
ran
across
coombs
yuh
remember
i
told
yuh
about
how
that
came
about
and
that
he
seemed
to
think
i
saved
his
life
well
he
and
me
kept
house
together
here
for
some
months
and
then
one
day
thar
come
the
biggest
surprise
i
ever
had
he
fetched
a
crate
along
up
from
town
in
a
wagon
he
hired
and
say
inside
the
same
was
the
finest
pair
o
silver
blacks
i
ever
saw
then
some
more
wagons
begun
to
show
up
fetchin
rolls
of
wire
netting
and
bags
o
cement
to
make
concrete
with
coombs
had
gone
into
the
fur
raisin
business
for
keeps
and
i
was
to
have
an
interest
in
the
game
he
had
an
agreement
all
written
out
that
both
us
signed
before
a
justice
which
fixed
things
up
half
the
proceeds
the
fur
farm
was
to
come
to
me
while
i
stayed
here
to
look
after
things
well
sir
we
worked
like
fun
to
git
the
stockade
built
to
form
and
our
mated
pair
o
foxes
planted
in
the
same
since
then
fixed
three
more
enclosures
ready
for
an
increase
o
stock
coombs
he
called
this
the
lone
lodge
black
fox
farm
and
i
guess
the
name
will
stick
even
after
i
get
to
selling
off
some
o
the
product
it
was
simply
wonderful
all
of
the
eager
listeners
thought
max
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
and
yet
so
far
as
he
could
make
out
obed
seemed
in
dead
earnest
besides
he
had
the
documents
to
prove
the
truth
of
his
story
he
said
which
he
would
spread
before
them
a
little
later
on
as
for
that
skeptic
he
rolled
his
eyes
up
many
times
while
listening
and
seemed
to
be
swallowing
it
with
considerable
difficulty
toby
and
steve
never
questioned
the
veracity
of
the
narrator
they
were
simply
amazed
at
the
immensity
of
the
enterprise
that
had
sprung
up
almost
like
a
mushroom
over
night
millions
on
millions
of
dollars
invested
in
artificial
fur
farming
and
the
general
public
utterly
in
the
dark
concerning
the
facts
until
recently
when
its
scope
could
no
longer
be
concealed
like
a
light
hidden
under
a
bushel
and
now
that
you
kinder
got
an
idea
of
what
a
big
fur
farm
might
be
like
the
singular
woods
boy
went
on
to
say
rising
as
he
spoke
yuh
meander
out
and
take
a
look
at
my
humble
beginnin
i
surely
hope
yuh
wo
run
down
my
efforts
o
course
things
ai
got
to
runnin
full
swing
yet
but
the
cubs
are
nigh
big
enough
to
be
taken
to
market
how
many
have
you
got
obed
asked
max
following
the
other
out
of
the
cabin
one
pair
nearly
grown
and
another
just
two
months
old
i
been
mighty
lucky
in
not
losing
a
single
pup
so
far
came
the
reply
over
obed
shoulder
and
he
might
be
pardoned
for
putting
just
a
mite
of
pride
in
his
tones
for
he
had
accomplished
something
worth
while
for
a
new
beginner
at
the
business
but
if
you
expect
to
keep
in
this
line
said
quickly
as
though
he
voiced
a
suspicion
that
kept
cropping
up
in
his
mind
why
do
you
want
to
dispose
of
that
first
pair
of
pups
obed
laughed
i
tell
yuh
he
said
confidentially
in
the
first
place
breeders
like
to
change
their
stock
so
as
to
bring
new
blood
into
the
pens
then
again
why
i
happens
to
need
the
money
that
comin
to
me
for
my
share
a
fellow
has
got
to
live
up
here
in
the
mountains
and
grub
costs
a
wheen
o
hard
cash
when
yuh
got
a
good
appetite
which
seems
to
fit
me
all
right
but
if
i
get
what
i
for
it
be
all
right
and
i
reckons
thar
come
some
years
before
we
let
more
foxes
get
away
from
this
same
farm
so
he
took
them
to
where
he
had
his
main
enclosure
in
which
the
boys
found
the
parent
foxes
they
may
have
become
somewhat
accustomed
to
seeing
obed
and
hearing
the
sound
of
his
coaxing
voice
for
even
the
most
timid
of
wild
animals
in
the
process
of
time
comes
to
recognize
the
one
who
supplies
their
wants
along
the
line
of
daily
food
but
possibly
or
steve
chanced
to
laugh
or
speak
out
loud
for
the
old
foxes
took
the
alarm
and
it
was
only
after
constant
efforts
on
the
part
of
obed
with
his
familiar
call
to
dinner
that
caused
them
to
show
themselves
at
all
they
were
certainly
beauties
max
wondered
more
than
ever
at
the
nerve
of
obed
in
trying
to
start
a
silver
black
fox
farm
in
this
section
with
no
one
save
himself
apparently
in
charge
he
feared
that
the
enterprise
would
be
doomed
to
certain
disaster
the
smart
woods
boy
might
be
successful
in
raising
a
crop
of
valuable
youngsters
in
the
fox
line
but
sooner
or
later
some
unscrupulous
men
guides
out
of
a
job
perhaps
and
loaded
with
strong
drink
would
try
to
make
a
secret
raid
on
his
preserves
and
clean
him
out
in
a
single
night
fox
pelts
worth
thousands
of
dollars
must
tempt
some
men
beyond
their
fears
or
power
of
resistance
max
made
up
his
mind
he
would
talk
about
this
with
obed
before
he
left
he
wondered
at
the
policy
of
the
executor
of
estate
in
allowing
so
much
money
to
be
tied
up
in
this
property
without
proper
safeguards
if
it
was
intended
to
continue
the
fox
farm
now
that
it
gave
all
evidences
of
possible
success
surely
the
boy
should
have
an
assistant
some
strong
woodsman
who
could
by
his
presence
and
readiness
to
do
battle
awe
any
intended
transgressors
they
next
visited
the
enclosure
where
the
two
pair
of
little
foxes
played
and
slept
and
ate
their
fill
daily
increasing
in
size
and
value
they
were
also
timid
though
in
due
time
obed
managed
to
get
them
to
show
themselves
for
hunger
is
a
powerful
inducement
and
the
smell
of
favorite
food
a
lure
difficult
to
resist
of
course
explained
the
young
fur
farmer
while
they
were
watching
the
inmates
of
the
second
enclosure
i
do
have
black
cats
up
here
yet
to
carry
out
them
directions
exactly
but
i
aiming
to
do
that
also
pretty
soon
yep
and
after
this
set
o
pups
has
been
sold
if
they
fetch
all
i
count
on
i
goin
to
have
a
talk
with
the
lawyer
that
looks
after
coombs
estate
he
promised
to
come
up
and
see
what
could
be
done
about
extendin
the
farm
and
then
i
guess
it
goin
to
be
time
to
hire
a
helper
seein
i
ca
do
everything
by
myself
that
was
just
what
i
meant
to
speak
to
you
about
obed
exclaimed
max
you
ought
to
try
to
stay
here
another
winter
all
by
yourself
besides
some
unscrupulous
men
might
raid
your
enclosures
while
you
were
off
hunting
or
fishing
and
break
up
your
business
it
is
safe
obed
and
i
know
from
what
you
said
before
about
suspecting
strangers
were
around
here
right
now
that
you
getting
anxious
yourself
the
boy
drew
a
long
breath
and
nodded
his
head
into
his
eyes
crept
a
look
quite
the
opposite
of
that
merry
gleam
usually
nestling
there
yes
plainly
obed
worried
over
something
and
max
believed
he
had
put
his
finger
directly
on
the
sore
spot
when
he
spoke
of
a
possible
raid
on
the
fur
product
of
the
singular
farm
can
you
find
just
such
a
reliable
man
as
you
want
obed
asked
steve
that
part
ai
so
hard
he
was
told
fact
is
i
got
him
more
half
engaged
his
name
is
jerry
stocks
and
he
a
woods
guide
been
a
heap
interested
in
this
game
ever
since
we
started
up
fact
is
jerry
has
done
a
heap
o
things
for
me
from
time
to
time
yuh
see
i
could
work
it
all
he
lives
miles
off
that
ways
we
fixed
a
way
to
signal
to
each
other
by
flyin
a
little
white
flag
from
two
low
peaks
when
i
want
jerry
i
run
my
flag
up
and
if
home
why
the
next
day
or
mebbe
sooner
he
shows
up
but
shucks
that
would
keep
me
from
losin
my
stock
if
there
was
a
real
raid
he
went
on
talking
further
and
the
boys
picked
up
considerable
more
valuable
information
for
obed
was
apparently
well
posted
on
the
subject
which
had
occupied
his
thoughts
night
and
day
so
he
told
them
that
perhaps
if
all
went
well
he
might
take
up
a
companion
industry
being
nothing
more
nor
less
than
trying
to
raise
mink
or
otter
in
captivity
i
know
it
is
done
to
any
great
extent
yet
he
explained
but
that
no
reason
there
should
be
some
ready
money
picked
up
in
the
business
it
would
pay
anything
like
the
foxes
and
for
that
reason
i
go
slow
about
it
oh
i
got
a
heap
o
ways
for
gettin
the
ready
cash
to
keep
up
my
share
o
the
expenses
o
the
farm
here
found
two
bee
trees
and
sent
the
honey
to
market
too
got
nigh
twenty
dollars
for
the
honey
then
i
dig
ginseng
roots
times
when
nothing
else
to
do
come
over
with
me
and
see
my
frog
pond
last
shipment
o
big
fat
saddles
brought
me
a
neat
little
wad
o
money
and
they
do
cost
me
a
cent
if
yuh
want
to
know
it
the
four
boys
looked
at
each
other
in
increased
wonderment
what
manner
of
chap
was
this
same
obed
to
be
able
to
wrest
a
living
from
a
bounteous
nature
in
the
clever
way
he
did
steve
in
particular
was
loud
in
his
praise
why
obed
old
fellow
he
burst
out
with
you
just
the
same
kind
of
an
enterprising
chap
max
here
has
always
been
why
it
was
his
grand
idea
about
there
being
mussels
aplenty
in
the
big
sunflower
down
our
way
that
started
us
into
making
a
try
for
pearls
in
the
river
we
found
too
some
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
them
and
when
the
news
leaked
out
whee
the
farmers
all
around
had
a
tough
time
getting
their
harvests
home
because
every
hand
was
treading
for
mussels
in
the
creeks
and
small
rivers
for
thirty
miles
around
carson
why
i
bet
you
it
be
as
hard
to
find
a
clam
down
our
way
now
as
a
needle
in
a
haystack
they
all
cleaned
out
you
see
max
here
had
read
about
pearls
being
found
out
in
indiana
and
other
places
and
that
gave
him
the
big
idea
just
like
you
got
set
on
the
fur
farm
business
by
reading
about
it
they
duly
inspected
the
marsh
where
obed
hunted
his
big
greenback
frogs
when
he
thought
the
crop
warranted
a
thinning
out
they
always
in
demand
down
new
york
ways
whar
they
fetch
a
dollar
a
pound
for
the
saddles
he
explained
and
let
me
tell
yuh
it
take
a
great
many
o
them
to
weigh
that
much
i
got
some
granddaddy
bouncers
here
that
make
you
stare
to
see
but
they
do
show
up
much
at
this
time
o
day
and
how
do
you
get
them
by
the
wholesale
when
you
want
to
market
any
asked
steve
i
shot
many
a
one
with
a
small
flobert
rifle
or
else
caught
them
with
a
piece
of
red
flannel
fixed
on
a
small
hook
attached
by
a
short
cord
to
a
stout
pole
well
men
in
the
regular
business
could
go
about
it
as
slow
as
that
said
the
other
though
i
have
shot
a
few
o
the
big
uns
that
way
they
was
too
tricky
to
be
grabbed
with
my
hand
net
if
you
stay
with
me
a
spell
we
get
more
one
mess
o
frog
legs
if
yuh
likes
them
was
seen
to
work
his
lips
as
though
his
month
fairly
watered
at
the
pleasing
prospect
for
those
who
are
fond
of
the
dish
say
that
frogs
legs
are
more
delicate
than
the
best
spring
chicken
with
just
a
little
taste
of
fish
about
them
that
rather
adds
to
the
piquancy
having
by
this
time
exhausted
about
all
the
sights
of
the
wonderful
farm
the
boys
headed
back
again
toward
the
cabin
max
could
not
but
notice
that
obed
showed
signs
of
uneasiness
while
away
and
cast
frequent
glances
in
the
direction
where
under
those
whispering
pines
and
the
dark
green
hemlocks
his
lone
lodge
stood
therefore
max
was
not
very
much
surprised
when
as
he
and
obed
strolled
along
in
the
rear
of
the
other
three
who
were
chatting
and
arguing
about
certain
matters
the
young
fur
farmer
pressed
his
arm
confidentially
and
went
on
to
say
i
like
to
tell
yuh
something
max
i
own
up
it
gettin
on
my
nerves
i
thought
nothin
could
bother
me
any
but
now
that
the
time
is
so
close
at
hand
when
i
mean
tuh
sell
that
pair
o
grown
pups
and
get
the
money
i
need
so
bad
why
things
look
kinder
different
fact
is
max
he
went
on
allowing
his
voice
to
sink
into
a
mysterious
stage
whisper
somebody
was
lookin
around
in
my
cabin
while
i
was
down
at
your
camp
last
evenin
i
know
this
because
things
was
more
or
less
upset
and
i
reckon
my
comin
back
scared
the
man
away
whoever
he
may
have
been
chapter
viii
products
of
the
fur
farm
that
looks
bad
obed
max
hastened
to
say
feeling
a
perceptible
thrill
at
the
very
thought
of
being
on
hand
to
assist
this
enterprising
boy
defend
his
property
which
he
had
made
so
valuable
through
his
own
efforts
in
most
part
i
saw
a
smoke
last
evening
too
which
must
have
been
made
by
a
i
wondered
if
there
were
deer
hunters
up
here
so
early
or
if
some
men
might
be
after
your
foxes
of
course
that
idea
only
came
to
me
after
you
had
told
us
about
your
enterprise
and
how
valuable
the
pelts
were
it
mighty
tough
avowed
obed
between
his
set
teeth
to
be
so
nigh
success
and
then
face
failure
i
been
tempted
to
signal
for
jerry
to
come
over
and
help
me
stand
guard
a
spell
yuh
see
i
ought
to
be
on
my
way
to
town
with
that
pair
o
young
blacks
i
know
whar
i
get
more
for
alive
than
for
their
pelts
if
i
took
the
time
to
cure
the
same
which
i
do
want
to
do
oh
i
just
to
sell
and
that
all
thar
is
about
it
i
dreamed
about
the
day
i
get
that
check
and
show
er
that
lawyer
managin
coombs
estate
that
all
i
told
him
was
true
once
i
have
the
proof
that
thar
big
money
in
raisin
silver
blacks
he
promised
to
do
anything
in
reason
i
ask
max
made
up
his
mind
on
the
spot
look
here
obed
was
the
way
he
talked
for
max
always
believed
that
it
was
good
policy
to
hit
the
nail
directly
on
the
head
especially
when
the
subject
was
of
considerable
importance
what
to
hinder
you
going
off
with
that
pair
of
live
blacks
and
disposing
of
them
while
the
four
of
us
stay
here
and
run
your
fur
farm
for
you
it
would
only
take
a
few
days
and
we
got
the
time
to
spare
of
course
you
have
to
trust
us
to
the
limit
to
leave
things
in
our
charge
but
we
surely
be
pleased
to
help
you
out
and
depend
on
it
nobody
would
steal
any
of
the
other
inmates
of
the
pens
while
we
were
on
deck
we
got
only
one
gun
along
but
that
is
a
repeating
marlin
always
to
be
depended
on
to
do
its
work
the
woods
boy
was
visibly
affected
by
hearing
max
say
this
he
reached
for
the
other
hand
and
squeezed
it
almost
fiercely
oh
it
kind
of
you
to
say
that
max
he
exclaimed
as
though
the
words
sprang
directly
from
his
heart
and
d
know
i
tempted
to
take
you
at
your
word
for
i
get
those
pups
delivered
as
i
promised
everything
depends
on
that
deal
the
man
saw
them
three
months
ago
and
we
made
a
bargain
i
was
to
deliver
the
pups
to
him
by
the
time
first
snow
flew
and
it
due
any
day
now
you
know
a
singular
thing
had
happened
and
max
while
deeply
interested
in
what
obed
was
saying
could
not
help
but
notice
that
for
once
the
woods
boy
had
spoken
without
a
sign
of
the
rude
dialect
which
up
to
then
had
marked
his
manner
of
speech
this
further
aroused
the
curiosity
of
max
who
to
himself
was
saying
i
hit
the
mark
when
i
guessed
obed
was
smarter
than
he
let
on
and
could
talk
just
as
well
as
the
next
fellow
when
he
chose
he
just
fallen
into
speaking
that
way
through
his
association
with
these
rough
people
up
here
his
own
folks
likely
enough
or
else
he
likes
to
pull
the
wool
over
our
eyes
just
for
a
joke
aloud
max
continued
to
reassure
the
other
then
consider
it
as
good
as
settled
obed
he
said
that
we
hang
around
here
a
short
while
if
you
think
best
you
can
get
that
jerry
to
come
over
and
keep
his
finger
on
the
pulse
perhaps
it
might
be
wise
too
because
he
know
just
what
to
do
in
case
there
was
any
trouble
among
the
foxes
left
in
the
pens
and
it
is
all
new
to
us
remember
yuh
relieved
my
mind
a
heap
max
sure
yuh
have
obed
told
him
again
relapsing
into
the
vernacular
that
is
usually
a
part
of
a
woods
guide
language
and
tonight
i
set
the
traps
i
got
fixed
mebbe
if
so
be
trespassers
come
a
skulkin
around
they
might
git
a
little
surprise
but
i
show
yuh
what
i
mentionin
later
on
jest
now
i
want
to
tell
yuh
i
mighty
glad
i
dropped
into
yer
camp
last
evenin
o
slippin
away
like
i
fust
thought
o
doin
but
you
do
want
me
to
look
on
this
matter
as
a
secret
do
you
obed
the
other
started
max
thought
and
looked
quickly
at
him
now
what
might
yuh
be
meanin
by
that
max
he
presently
asked
a
bit
anxiously
oh
i
only
wanted
to
have
your
permission
to
tell
my
three
chums
what
you
been
saying
to
me
explained
max
of
course
i
know
what
their
answer
will
be
when
i
put
it
up
to
them
we
really
come
here
on
what
calls
a
wild
goose
hunt
for
there
is
one
chance
in
ten
that
we
ever
be
able
to
find
roland
chase
so
our
time
is
really
pretty
much
our
own
to
do
with
as
we
will
and
obed
all
of
us
have
taken
such
a
big
interest
in
your
enterprise
up
here
that
we
be
only
too
happy
to
lend
you
a
helping
hand
you
are
so
near
success
now
that
it
be
a
shame
if
you
fell
down
through
no
fault
of
your
own
that
what
i
keep
tellin
myself
too
max
do
you
know
exclaimed
the
now
excited
obed
i
hugged
that
hope
close
to
my
heart
month
after
month
and
now
when
i
almost
whiff
the
success
i
prayed
for
it
nearly
kill
me
to
lose
everything
oh
i
jest
wants
a
couple
of
weeks
at
the
most
and
then
i
show
yes
i
will
they
all
said
i
make
a
dead
failure
out
o
my
fur
farm
but
yuh
see
it
along
right
smart
when
they
reached
the
cabin
the
boys
threw
themselves
down
on
the
soft
yielding
turf
to
loaf
as
properly
expressed
it
and
surely
he
could
do
this
as
well
as
any
boy
who
ever
drew
breath
max
took
occasion
to
tell
the
others
what
he
and
obed
had
been
talking
about
all
of
them
were
deeply
interested
they
looked
angrily
at
each
other
when
max
explained
how
the
woods
boy
had
found
traces
of
some
intruder
who
had
actually
entered
his
lone
cabin
while
he
obed
was
away
in
their
company
also
telling
how
the
other
strongly
suspected
that
a
dastardly
plot
had
been
hatched
looking
to
the
robbing
of
the
pens
connected
with
the
silver
fox
fur
farm
obed
was
inside
doing
something
at
the
time
and
so
max
felt
that
he
could
talk
freely
he
meant
that
his
three
chums
should
know
everything
in
the
beginning
before
he
called
on
them
to
decide
whether
they
would
stay
over
a
few
days
and
guard
the
property
while
obed
was
marketing
his
first
proceeds
in
a
distant
city
for
the
pups
were
really
too
valuable
to
be
trusted
to
the
tender
mercies
of
an
express
company
obed
thought
i
do
exactly
understand
how
obed
knows
that
there
a
conspiracy
hatched
up
against
him
to
complete
the
ruination
of
his
enterprise
continued
max
but
he
seems
to
think
some
party
has
a
deep
grudge
against
him
it
may
be
we
know
more
about
this
later
on
but
for
the
present
i
promised
obed
i
put
up
a
proposition
to
you
then
let
hear
it
max
exclaimed
steve
though
i
reckon
we
all
give
a
pretty
close
guess
at
what
coming
why
obed
wants
to
get
away
with
that
pair
of
grown
pups
so
he
can
deliver
them
to
the
man
he
bargained
with
and
i
proposed
that
we
stay
here
a
few
days
and
guard
his
property
while
he
off
is
there
any
objection
to
that
plan
i
told
him
i
expected
i
could
count
on
my
chums
to
stick
by
me
i
should
say
you
could
max
chuckled
why
i
fairly
counting
on
depopulating
that
big
frog
marsh
while
we
hanging
around
this
section
and
say
steve
here
could
keep
us
supplied
with
trout
galore
if
only
he
fished
from
the
bank
and
did
wade
in
both
the
others
were
equally
prompt
to
agree
indeed
toby
fell
all
over
himself
as
steve
termed
it
in
his
eagerness
to
give
assent
and
could
only
recover
after
coming
to
an
abrupt
halt
taking
one
of
his
customary
big
breaths
and
then
giving
a
sharp
whistle
after
which
he
finished
what
he
was
saying
as
nicely
as
anything
and
that
settled
it
just
as
max
had
been
confident
would
be
the
case
for
he
knew
his
chums
too
well
to
believe
they
would
be
willing
to
let
such
a
brave
fight
be
lost
when
the
goal
seemed
so
near
obed
grimes
had
proved
to
be
a
fellow
after
their
own
hearts
and
they
found
themselves
deeply
interested
in
his
fortunes
so
when
the
woods
boy
came
out
again
max
suspected
that
he
had
purposely
withdrawn
from
the
scene
in
order
not
to
embarrass
them
while
making
their
decision
he
was
told
how
they
all
felt
and
obed
went
around
shaking
hands
with
the
tears
in
his
eyes
plainly
he
had
his
whole
heart
wrapped
up
in
the
successful
outcome
of
this
odd
venture
and
when
the
clouds
began
to
loom
up
overhead
this
proffered
assistance
on
the
part
of
the
four
chums
was
gratefully
received
this
is
mighty
nice
o
yuh
boys
he
kept
telling
them
as
though
really
at
a
loss
for
appropriate
words
best
calculated
to
express
the
state
of
his
feelings
and
i
ai
goin
to
ever
forget
it
either
now
i
feel
that
i
start
out
right
away
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
deliver
them
pups
to
sheckard
say
mebbe
i
wo
be
a
proud
boy
when
he
hands
me
that
big
check
and
i
know
that
i
won
out
against
all
odds
his
eyes
glowed
at
the
very
thought
and
max
was
more
than
glad
he
and
his
comrades
had
the
chance
to
render
so
resolute
a
chap
slight
assistance
for
it
would
really
be
a
pleasure
for
them
to
stay
there
at
that
wonderful
little
lodge
under
the
whispering
pines
and
keep
house
while
obed
was
away
then
too
jerry
would
be
on
hand
ready
with
his
advice
and
knowledge
so
as
to
do
the
proper
thing
as
to
any
rash
prowler
stealing
the
valuable
foxes
day
or
night
well
they
would
see
to
it
a
constant
watch
was
kept
and
that
the
gun
was
always
ready
to
block
any
nasty
little
game
like
that
later
on
max
amused
himself
lolling
in
coombs
big
fireside
chair
which
he
had
moved
near
one
of
the
windows
he
had
run
across
a
number
of
books
on
a
shelf
and
was
engaged
in
looking
them
over
though
hardly
bothering
to
actually
read
nevertheless
he
seemed
to
be
quite
curious
concerning
them
and
when
obed
chanced
to
come
in
max
naturally
asked
concerning
the
volumes
oh
yuh
see
some
o
them
belong
to
me
the
woods
boy
remarked
without
hesitation
and
they
were
left
here
by
coombs
he
was
a
great
reader
and
besides
he
traveled
all
over
the
known
world
yuh
remember
i
said
he
was
a
sea
captain
and
that
he
made
his
fortune
carryin
cargoes
from
the
far
east
to
england
and
america
sometime
tell
yuh
a
few
of
the
queer
adventures
he
had
in
foreign
countries
they
got
lots
o
thrills
about
too
just
so
ventured
max
casually
and
i
once
heard
some
people
talking
about
a
coombs
who
had
been
a
great
traveler
now
i
wonder
if
it
could
have
been
the
same
party
was
his
first
name
robert
oh
no
coombs
name
was
jared
replied
the
other
promptly
then
of
course
it
could
not
have
been
the
same
added
max
smiling
as
though
he
had
attained
the
object
of
his
questioning
but
the
similarity
in
names
and
the
fact
that
both
men
had
traveled
considerably
made
me
think
it
might
be
so
he
once
more
dipped
into
the
book
he
was
holding
although
watching
obed
slily
over
the
top
of
the
volume
and
when
the
woods
boy
had
passed
outside
again
max
hastings
might
have
been
seen
to
hurriedly
turn
back
to
the
blank
pages
at
the
front
of
the
book
scan
several
initials
that
were
plainly
written
there
and
then
nod
his
head
mysteriously
with
a
smile
that
gradually
crept
across
his
whole
face
just
as
though
something
pleased
him
which
for
the
time
being
he
chose
to
keep
to
himself
chapter
ix
laying
plans
to
help
obed
it
was
only
natural
that
steve
always
headstrong
and
impulsive
should
be
eager
to
find
out
what
kind
of
plan
might
be
arranged
looking
to
keeping
watch
and
ward
over
the
fur
farm
during
the
nights
to
come
he
had
been
impressed
with
the
signs
of
anxiety
which
obed
plainly
betrayed
when
speaking
of
his
belief
concerning
some
sort
of
plot
being
hatched
up
against
his
peace
of
mind
and
which
would
bring
about
the
ultimate
ruination
of
his
unique
and
intensely
interesting
undertaking
to
steve
the
idea
of
a
miserable
rascal
sneaking
up
in
the
night
to
destroy
all
that
poor
hardworking
obed
had
built
up
after
many
moons
was
simply
terrible
the
more
he
considered
it
the
greater
became
his
secret
anger
and
of
course
this
meant
that
his
liking
for
the
boy
fur
farmer
grew
in
proportion
during
the
afternoon
as
the
shadows
began
to
lengthen
perceptibly
steve
found
occasion
to
broach
the
subject
to
his
three
chums
max
had
come
out
of
the
cabin
evidently
he
had
tired
of
looking
over
the
books
which
might
do
very
well
to
pass
away
a
long
evening
or
a
rainy
day
when
time
dragged
but
could
not
chain
him
down
long
when
the
sun
was
shining
the
breeze
rustling
through
the
leaves
still
on
the
trees
and
with
all
nature
beckoning
so
steve
crooked
his
finger
toward
and
toby
lounging
near
by
and
being
in
a
humor
themselves
for
any
sort
of
thing
the
pair
hastened
to
join
him
and
max
upon
being
pounced
upon
by
the
balance
of
the
crowd
looked
askance
knowing
that
something
was
in
the
wind
strikes
me
fellows
commenced
steve
that
we
ought
to
be
figuring
on
what
we
expect
to
do
tonight
huh
as
for
me
quickly
responded
i
expecting
to
do
my
share
about
slingin
together
a
dandy
spread
with
some
of
the
fine
grub
we
fetched
along
this
mountain
air
is
something
terrible
when
it
comes
to
toning
up
i
feel
as
if
i
had
a
vacuum
down
about
my
middle
all
the
time
i
beginning
to
be
alarmed
about
my
condition
if
it
keeps
on
it
going
to
mean
bankruptcy
for
my
folks
that
all
about
me
now
added
toby
jucklin
briskly
i
hoping
to
a
sleep
tonight
unless
max
fixes
it
so
we
have
to
standing
sentry
duty
steve
looked
disgusted
oh
rats
i
did
mean
anything
like
that
and
you
both
know
it
he
told
the
two
grinning
chums
what
i
was
referring
to
was
on
the
point
of
duty
we
agreed
to
stand
back
of
our
new
friend
obed
and
see
to
it
that
he
is
robbed
of
the
proceeds
of
his
industry
by
unscrupulous
scoundrels
and
we
got
to
make
good
hear
hear
ejaculated
toby
pretending
to
clap
his
hands
in
applause
steve
you
exhausting
all
the
big
words
in
the
dictionary
with
your
language
warned
in
mock
severity
but
i
get
your
meaning
all
the
same
and
i
also
agree
with
your
noble
sentiments
sure
we
expecting
to
stand
up
for
obed
and
his
pets
and
likewise
intending
to
make
it
hot
for
any
old
terrapin
who
comes
creeping
around
here
with
the
idea
of
making
way
with
the
wearers
of
that
expensive
fur
how
about
it
max
that
a
settled
thing
readily
replied
the
one
appealed
to
and
whose
opinion
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
would
swing
things
one
way
or
another
since
the
other
fellows
were
in
the
habit
of
looking
up
to
max
as
their
leader
we
can
fix
it
up
in
regular
orthodox
style
each
fellow
having
two
hours
on
duty
and
the
rest
of
the
night
for
sleep
does
that
strike
you
as
about
right
well
remarked
steve
proudly
it
wo
be
the
first
occasion
when
this
bunch
has
had
to
stand
guard
not
by
a
long
sight
i
can
look
back
and
see
many
a
night
when
we
had
to
keep
an
anchor
to
windward
or
else
lose
something
we
prized
a
heap
ever
since
we
dug
up
all
those
mussels
in
the
big
sunflower
and
found
dandy
pearls
inside
some
of
them
it
seems
to
me
we
had
occasion
from
time
to
time
to
be
envied
by
other
people
and
had
to
keep
watch
so
we
would
be
robbed
oh
standing
sentry
is
an
old
trick
with
us
for
my
remarked
toby
yawning
as
he
spoke
i
much
rather
think
up
some
that
would
ease
the
and
allow
us
to
through
the
entire
night
please
explain
what
you
mean
by
saying
that
toby
demanded
steve
you
do
get
off
the
most
mysterious
communications
sometimes
and
muddle
us
all
up
but
there
is
anything
about
this
steve
protested
toby
all
of
you
know
i
been
a
to
make
take
the
place
of
power
what
the
need
of
our
awake
of
the
night
even
if
by
cudgeling
our
brains
we
think
up
some
that
would
answer
the
same
purpose
i
can
see
cudgeling
your
poor
brains
all
right
toby
sneered
steve
who
apparently
did
not
take
a
great
deal
of
stock
in
the
ability
for
conceiving
clever
ideas
and
a
pretty
mess
you
make
of
it
in
the
bargain
take
it
from
me
they
cudgeled
enough
as
it
is
that
will
do
for
you
steve
said
max
i
understand
just
what
toby
means
and
it
along
the
right
line
too
this
is
the
age
of
progress
and
people
do
want
to
depend
on
the
methods
that
were
good
enough
for
their
grandfathers
toby
thinks
one
of
us
might
suggest
a
scheme
whereby
we
could
guard
the
fox
farm
and
at
the
same
time
obtain
our
full
quota
of
sleep
in
other
words
rig
up
a
dummy
to
stand
our
trick
as
sentry
is
that
it
toby
what
i
had
in
my
mind
max
snapped
toby
and
any
silly
easy
see
that
sure
and
the
wise
ones
had
to
be
told
chirped
steve
jauntily
but
never
mind
arguing
toby
it
all
right
and
i
only
joking
i
get
the
idea
and
now
has
any
one
a
scheme
on
tap
that
would
apply
to
the
case
toby
scratched
his
head
as
though
he
considered
that
having
been
the
first
to
make
the
suggestion
it
was
up
to
him
to
say
something
no
matter
how
well
there
the
trap
you
know
he
remarked
without
once
stuttering
which
fact
proved
that
he
was
deliberately
taking
his
time
about
answering
what
sort
of
arrangement
do
you
call
that
i
like
to
know
asked
steve
you
a
hunter
and
never
heard
about
the
trap
exclaimed
toby
scornfully
well
i
try
to
explain
if
you
give
me
a
little
and
do
me
too
much
you
see
a
gun
is
to
the
ground
and
aiming
along
a
certain
avenue
that
the
intended
thief
has
just
to
use
in
up
to
the
then
a
is
so
the
thief
against
the
just
like
max
here
fixes
his
nights
when
he
wants
to
off
a
skunk
or
a
by
flashlight
well
the
goes
off
and
mister
thief
with
number
twelve
birdshot
when
you
hear
the
and
his
howls
why
you
just
out
and
in
the
there
do
you
understand
about
the
trap
now
steve
oh
i
knew
all
that
before
only
you
mixed
me
up
by
giving
it
that
name
the
other
hastily
replied
but
it
strikes
me
that
be
a
pretty
rough
deal
for
us
to
play
it
might
answer
if
the
thief
were
an
animal
but
a
human
being
is
different
all
the
same
retorted
toby
savagely
he
a
and
outside
the
of
the
law
just
so
steve
went
on
and
max
was
surprised
at
his
moderation
because
as
a
rule
steve
had
always
been
the
most
reckless
one
of
the
crowd
but
suppose
now
we
found
that
we
done
more
than
we
calculated
on
toby
a
charge
of
small
birdshot
starts
out
on
its
errand
a
whole
lot
like
a
bullet
it
does
commence
to
scatter
till
it
gets
just
so
far
away
from
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
depending
on
the
size
of
the
bore
and
the
way
the
barrel
is
choked
i
known
a
charge
of
shot
to
tear
a
hole
right
through
a
board
when
fired
at
close
range
at
a
distance
it
would
only
have
scattered
out
and
peppered
the
whole
fence
and
toby
we
might
feel
rather
bad
if
we
found
we
killed
a
man
even
if
he
was
a
thief
toby
did
not
answer
to
that
fling
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
he
shivered
at
the
gruesome
picture
steve
words
drew
before
his
mental
vision
for
toby
was
not
at
all
bloodthirsty
max
now
took
a
hand
in
the
conversation
listen
fellows
he
went
on
to
say
it
strikes
me
that
when
we
set
about
discussing
this
matter
we
ought
to
remember
that
there
one
chap
who
considerably
more
interested
in
the
outcome
than
any
of
us
can
ever
be
you
mean
obed
when
you
say
that
max
ventured
he
the
one
the
other
admitted
and
we
ought
to
invite
him
to
join
us
in
figuring
out
our
plans
now
it
may
be
obed
will
have
a
scheme
of
his
own
that
knock
any
we
might
think
up
all
silly
i
call
him
over
and
tell
him
what
we
trying
to
arrange
it
happened
that
just
then
obed
was
passing
on
his
way
to
the
cabin
he
had
been
working
somewhere
amidst
his
enclosures
perhaps
making
certain
preparations
for
insuring
the
safety
of
his
valuable
furry
pets
should
a
descent
on
the
farm
come
about
during
the
hours
of
darkness
obed
hastened
to
join
them
his
questioning
look
influenced
max
to
explain
without
hesitation
and
the
woods
boy
smiled
broadly
when
he
heard
how
his
friends
were
already
taking
so
decided
an
interest
in
his
fortunes
now
it
might
be
he
started
to
say
again
looking
serious
that
all
this
fuss
ai
worth
the
candle
and
that
nothin
going
to
happen
but
i
believe
in
shuttin
the
door
the
hoss
is
stolen
it
too
late
afterwards
i
have
got
the
time
right
now
to
tell
yuh
jest
how
i
learned
that
my
foxes
was
agoin
tuh
be
in
danger
somebody
i
knew
wrote
me
a
letter
and
warned
me
which
have
tuh
be
enuff
jest
now
tuh
explain
since
i
got
that
same
three
days
back
i
been
figgerin
on
how
i
could
fix
up
a
trap
tuh
ketch
any
varmint
that
chanced
tuh
come
sneakin
around
here
of
a
night
well
i
got
one
er
two
tricks
rigged
up
that
might
fill
the
bill
of
course
you
mean
to
show
them
to
us
obed
steve
burst
out
with
for
if
you
did
and
we
were
left
in
charge
here
one
of
us
might
fall
into
the
pit
and
get
knocked
out
which
would
be
tough
luck
thinking
oh
i
meant
to
show
you
steve
asserted
the
fur
farmer
quickly
and
if
so
be
yuh
come
along
with
me
right
now
we
take
a
look
at
the
contraptions
which
of
course
yuh
understand
are
only
meant
for
and
tuh
help
out
when
jerry
would
be
around
for
me
to
sorter
lean
on
being
boys
who
did
things
themselves
it
was
only
natural
that
the
four
chums
should
feel
a
decided
interest
in
what
obed
had
just
said
even
max
showed
an
eagerness
to
go
forth
and
examine
the
said
traps
he
could
speculate
as
to
what
their
character
might
turn
out
to
be
but
this
only
added
a
little
more
spice
to
the
occasion
so
when
obed
turned
and
started
off
with
a
beckoning
finger
that
enticed
them
to
follow
his
lead
none
of
the
quartette
held
back
chapter
x
traps
fob
night
prowlers
yuh
see
remarked
obed
turning
around
as
they
drew
near
the
first
enclosure
where
the
parent
foxes
were
confined
behind
the
wire
fencing
i
just
been
adding
a
few
finishing
touches
tuh
this
here
trap
scheme
i
got
a
little
idea
while
i
was
alookin
the
ground
over
and
reckoned
i
could
fix
it
up
so
there
be
a
heap
right
good
chance
that
a
feller
creeping
around
here
o
a
night
would
step
into
the
contraption
i
show
yuh
how
i
it
with
that
he
led
the
way
along
a
plain
trail
that
seemed
to
be
the
easiest
route
up
to
the
enclosure
three
times
out
of
four
a
stranger
prowling
around
with
meagre
light
to
guide
him
would
be
apt
to
follow
that
beaten
track
and
this
was
evidently
what
the
shrewd
obed
was
counting
on
well
it
this
way
my
little
scheme
is
agoin
to
work
he
explained
after
reaching
a
certain
point
see
this
rope
i
throw
it
across
a
limb
o
this
tree
yuh
notice
that
it
got
an
easy
runnin
at
the
end
do
yuh
that
i
fixing
right
here
where
there
a
good
chance
the
thief
will
put
his
foot
in
it
as
he
takes
this
step
i
showing
you
he
proved
that
he
was
right
and
indeed
it
was
really
a
difficult
thing
after
obed
had
placed
the
noose
just
as
he
wanted
it
close
to
the
ground
and
on
little
wooden
crotches
he
had
arranged
there
for
the
purpose
for
any
one
to
step
across
without
getting
his
foot
entangled
in
the
rope
well
let
reckon
then
he
does
get
caught
in
the
noose
and
jerks
it
tight
around
his
ankle
continued
obed
very
much
interested
himself
in
what
he
was
saying
and
as
max
quickly
noticed
even
neglecting
to
speak
as
he
usually
did
although
he
had
shown
this
odd
trait
before
what
happens
i
show
you
how
it
going
to
work
out
if
everything
runs
as
i
planned
accordingly
he
picked
up
a
heavy
piece
of
wood
that
chanced
to
be
lying
close
by
and
which
doubtless
obed
had
used
before
in
order
to
test
the
accuracy
of
his
figuring
this
he
inserted
in
the
noose
and
then
gave
it
a
hunch
that
not
only
tightened
the
rope
but
carried
out
the
further
purpose
of
the
inventor
instantly
things
began
to
happen
the
boys
heard
a
queer
rattling
sound
near
by
and
immediately
the
wooden
dummy
was
jerked
out
of
hands
to
be
drawn
up
until
it
struck
against
the
limb
of
the
tree
fully
ten
feet
above
steve
gave
a
whoop
my
stars
but
that
worked
like
a
charm
obed
let
me
tell
you
greased
lightning
could
hardly
be
quicker
than
the
way
you
arranged
your
trap
and
what
was
all
that
rattling
sound
about
what
holding
on
to
the
other
end
of
the
rope
which
pulled
the
log
up
on
the
run
i
want
to
know
even
if
i
ai
from
missouri
the
woods
boy
laughed
as
though
quite
pleased
because
his
trap
had
worked
well
enough
to
call
forth
such
words
of
praise
from
these
new
friends
come
over
and
see
he
simply
said
they
followed
the
line
of
rope
now
taut
and
resembling
a
huge
fiddle
string
as
remarked
testing
it
as
he
passed
along
it
led
them
to
the
brow
of
an
abrupt
little
descent
a
sheer
drop
of
perhaps
twenty
feet
down
this
slope
they
followed
the
rope
with
their
eyes
and
then
discovered
it
was
attached
to
a
large
and
heavy
barrel
that
could
almost
be
called
a
hogshead
evidently
something
which
had
been
used
as
a
crate
to
convey
a
portion
of
the
previous
owner
of
the
crockery
ware
thither
when
he
moved
up
from
town
as
the
boys
were
no
simpletons
they
readily
grasped
the
essential
qualities
of
obed
little
scheme
it
may
have
been
original
with
him
and
then
again
possibly
he
had
borrowed
the
same
from
some
book
he
had
read
but
nevertheless
it
struck
them
as
pretty
clever
not
content
with
the
heaviness
of
the
big
barrel
he
had
placed
a
number
of
stones
inside
so
as
to
add
to
the
swiftness
of
its
flight
down
that
declivity
once
it
was
released
the
rope
acted
as
starter
and
upon
being
jerked
as
must
be
the
case
should
any
one
get
a
foot
caught
in
the
noose
it
released
a
stake
that
kept
the
heavy
barrel
poised
there
at
the
top
of
the
descent
the
consequence
was
that
it
would
plunge
downward
almost
as
though
making
a
sheer
drop
the
noose
tightening
about
the
leg
or
legs
of
the
unhappy
wight
who
had
sprung
the
trap
he
would
be
jerked
off
his
feet
and
hauled
up
head
downward
to
dangle
there
in
midair
as
helpless
as
a
babe
set
it
again
and
let
me
try
the
trick
please
obed
pleaded
steve
who
seemed
to
be
particularly
charmed
with
the
arrangement
i
will
if
yuh
help
me
git
the
barrel
back
up
the
hill
again
replied
the
other
workin
all
by
myself
i
had
tuh
take
the
rocks
out
each
time
before
i
could
push
the
old
thing
back
again
tuh
the
top
she
some
heavy
believe
me
steve
yes
and
both
and
toby
also
hastened
to
comply
with
this
reasonable
request
and
between
them
all
the
heavy
barrel
was
slowly
pushed
up
again
until
the
stake
held
it
poised
there
on
the
top
of
the
sharp
declivity
max
stood
and
watched
operations
not
that
he
was
unwilling
to
lend
a
hand
also
if
necessary
but
just
then
he
wanted
to
observe
obed
and
draw
certain
conclusions
in
which
he
max
seemed
to
take
considerable
interest
then
steve
was
given
the
wooden
dummy
which
had
worked
so
like
a
charm
and
instructed
how
to
manage
it
so
that
it
would
take
the
place
of
a
man
lower
extremities
steve
did
so
well
that
he
too
by
a
little
jerk
displaced
the
delicately
arranged
trigger
as
obed
called
the
stake
and
caused
the
barrel
to
pitch
furiously
down
the
steep
slope
steve
had
not
been
quite
quick
enough
to
snatch
his
hands
away
after
working
the
trick
the
consequence
was
that
when
the
billet
of
wood
was
plucked
from
his
grasp
with
such
swiftness
and
drawn
instantly
aloft
steve
staggered
and
might
have
fallen
only
that
obed
clutched
hold
of
him
wow
did
you
see
that
gasped
steve
staring
upwards
at
the
dangling
dummy
as
though
he
could
easily
imagine
it
a
kicking
squirming
human
figure
and
say
it
worked
as
fine
as
silk
did
it
obed
done
yourself
proud
with
this
little
game
if
that
thief
ever
gets
a
foot
in
your
his
goose
will
be
cooked
that
as
plain
as
dirt
he
actually
seemed
to
be
very
proud
of
the
fact
that
he
had
acted
as
master
of
ceremonies
and
set
the
trap
off
so
successfully
nothing
would
do
but
that
and
toby
jucklin
in
addition
should
be
given
the
same
distinction
so
twice
more
was
the
barrel
rolled
up
the
slope
and
on
both
occasions
it
worked
to
a
charm
it
seems
to
be
next
door
to
perfect
for
a
fact
asserted
max
upon
being
appealed
to
for
his
opinion
but
he
did
not
seem
to
hanker
after
trying
it
out
on
his
own
account
finally
the
weighted
barrel
was
again
pushed
up
to
its
appointed
position
and
held
there
with
the
stake
when
the
proper
time
came
it
would
be
easy
for
the
inventor
to
arrange
the
and
set
the
trap
what
is
there
anything
more
to
be
shown
asked
steve
when
obed
asked
them
to
follow
him
a
little
further
a
few
minutes
later
and
they
were
gravely
examining
an
odd
arrangement
which
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
a
very
heavy
log
steve
looked
it
over
critically
and
then
ventured
to
give
his
opinion
looks
a
whole
lot
like
a
deadfall
trap
such
as
they
use
in
most
places
to
get
bears
in
he
went
on
to
say
obed
chuckled
as
though
pleased
at
the
answer
to
his
look
of
inquiry
just
what
it
is
built
on
the
pattern
of
steve
if
yuh
want
to
know
it
he
admitted
the
only
difference
is
that
in
the
regular
deadfall
the
log
comes
down
and
smashes
the
poor
bear
by
its
sheer
weight
now
i
tried
to
rig
trap
up
so
it
simply
make
a
prisoner
o
the
creeper
i
show
yuh
just
how
it
works
i
got
a
dummy
here
too
that
i
use
to
test
things
yuh
see
there
always
just
a
little
chance
it
might
go
wrong
and
i
do
want
to
get
caught
and
made
a
prisoner
with
nobody
around
to
let
me
loose
with
that
he
demonstrated
his
idea
the
trap
was
sprung
just
as
he
meant
it
should
be
and
if
the
dummy
had
really
been
a
man
he
would
have
found
himself
caught
tightly
in
the
log
trap
with
but
a
poor
chance
of
ever
getting
out
again
unless
external
assistance
came
along
any
more
tricks
like
these
two
up
your
sleeve
obed
asked
steve
after
they
had
further
examined
the
deadfall
and
max
had
pronounced
it
skillfully
constructed
well
i
afraid
i
reached
the
end
o
my
rope
when
i
hatched
up
this
second
idea
steve
the
other
remarked
in
a
sort
of
apologetic
tone
of
course
i
might
think
up
a
few
more
if
i
reckoned
it
be
necessary
but
i
got
a
hunch
that
one
o
the
lot
is
agoin
tuh
grab
that
thief
providin
he
does
come
around
here
besides
when
yuh
git
right
down
to
brass
tacks
thar
is
as
much
danger
o
my
bein
robbed
in
the
as
in
the
day
and
why
not
obed
further
asked
steve
i
think
that
was
the
very
time
you
feel
scariest
when
it
was
dark
and
you
could
see
if
anybody
was
prowling
around
the
farm
stop
an
think
how
foxes
have
holes
in
the
ground
into
which
they
burrow
when
scared
the
least
mite
explained
obed
readily
and
see
how
hard
it
be
for
a
stranger
to
lay
hands
on
them
now
in
the
daytime
if
they
came
along
with
me
away
from
the
place
a
man
with
a
rifle
could
knock
over
my
pets
as
easy
as
turnin
his
hand
but
all
the
same
i
fixed
my
traps
for
one
thing
i
like
to
find
out
jest
who
the
thief
is
max
noticed
what
emphasis
he
put
on
that
last
remark
he
could
see
the
customary
twinkle
in
obed
eyes
give
way
to
a
sterner
look
as
though
he
had
brooded
more
or
less
over
this
same
subject
and
max
himself
nodded
his
head
as
though
he
might
in
a
measure
understand
just
how
obed
felt
so
they
returned
to
the
house
at
least
rejoiced
because
with
all
those
clever
contraptions
set
and
waiting
to
give
the
intended
thief
a
warm
reception
it
did
seem
as
though
there
would
be
hardly
any
necessity
for
them
to
waste
their
precious
time
in
sitting
up
and
keeping
watch
when
they
would
be
so
much
better
off
enjoying
balmy
sleep
as
he
called
it
and
all
sleep
was
along
that
order
according
to
the
mind
of
max
and
steve
trailed
along
well
in
the
rear
this
may
have
simply
happened
but
steve
twice
stopped
the
other
and
pointed
out
something
he
wished
max
to
see
so
possibly
the
delay
was
intentional
on
his
part
at
least
he
presently
made
a
remark
that
would
make
it
seem
so
it
certainly
looks
as
if
obed
was
a
pretty
ingenious
maker
of
snares
that
sure
max
steve
was
saying
significantly
that
right
he
is
steve
and
we
must
give
him
great
credit
for
it
even
if
his
traps
fail
to
catch
a
thief
in
the
act
i
was
just
thinking
max
pursued
the
other
meditatively
that
evident
this
same
obed
must
have
inherited
that
strain
from
a
long
line
of
trapper
ancestors
or
progenitors
would
you
think
so
too
max
looked
at
his
companion
queerly
and
smiled
as
he
made
reply
you
may
be
right
steve
of
course
but
it
strikes
me
obed
has
an
original
streak
of
genius
all
his
own
which
does
have
to
depend
on
any
inherited
trait
things
are
not
what
they
seem
in
this
world
you
know
lookey
here
max
you
struck
a
scent
which
you
do
think
best
to
share
with
your
boon
companions
that
as
plain
to
me
as
two
and
two
make
four
you
come
to
think
a
little
the
same
way
as
perhaps
and
suspect
obed
of
being
more
than
he
lets
on
is
that
it
max
do
you
really
believe
he
playing
some
sly
trick
on
us
is
that
yarn
about
coombs
all
moonshine
does
this
fur
farm
belong
to
some
company
that
obed
is
working
for
i
wish
you
tell
me
what
you
got
in
your
mind
max
i
expect
to
a
little
later
on
steve
never
fear
he
was
assured
not
more
than
half
certain
even
now
that
it
can
be
so
and
i
never
like
to
make
a
mess
of
things
besides
you
know
it
would
be
just
fair
to
obed
to
have
us
all
suspecting
him
of
playing
tricks
just
go
on
as
you
been
doing
take
my
word
for
it
this
new
friend
we
made
is
all
to
the
good
and
will
never
turn
out
to
be
the
wrong
sort
of
fellow
he
started
on
after
saying
this
and
steve
followed
looking
very
much
puzzled
and
shaking
his
head
as
though
he
could
not
catch
the
right
idea
shortly
afterwards
however
steve
had
apparently
forgotten
his
newly
awakened
suspicions
for
he
was
entering
into
the
general
conversation
as
heartily
as
ever
still
max
noticed
with
amusement
that
from
time
to
time
steve
would
follow
obed
hungrily
with
his
eyes
and
on
such
occasions
that
double
line
of
wrinkles
expressive
of
bewilderment
might
again
be
seen
upon
the
boy
forehead
toby
and
were
only
too
glad
to
take
the
preparation
of
supper
into
their
hands
completely
they
felt
a
certain
amount
of
pride
in
their
culinary
skill
and
wished
to
show
their
host
the
full
list
of
their
accomplishments
as
camp
cooks
besides
they
believed
that
among
their
abundant
stores
they
carried
a
number
of
things
which
obed
failed
to
possess
and
of
course
a
new
dish
was
apt
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
to
the
woods
boy
the
supper
thus
concocted
and
carried
out
was
certainly
a
genuine
triumph
steve
openly
congratulated
the
two
efficient
cooks
on
their
masterly
skill
though
max
laughingly
warned
the
others
to
beware
of
the
greeks
bearing
gifts
for
there
might
be
a
base
motive
hiding
behind
all
that
glib
praise
steve
protested
that
he
meant
every
word
of
it
but
then
it
was
well
known
that
steve
hated
to
do
any
cooking
himself
and
hence
was
fain
to
laud
the
efforts
of
others
in
that
line
doubtless
in
the
hope
of
encouraging
them
to
keep
right
on
doing
it
after
the
bountiful
meal
had
been
enjoyed
and
every
one
declared
that
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
to
eat
another
single
bite
for
fear
of
the
consequences
they
spent
a
very
enjoyable
evening
alongside
the
fire
that
burned
on
the
hearth
at
one
end
of
the
cabin
obed
as
he
had
promised
told
them
some
of
the
strange
things
he
had
heard
from
the
old
sea
captain
who
during
his
life
on
the
seven
seas
had
met
with
many
most
remarkable
adventures
well
worth
repeating
obed
addressed
them
in
his
own
language
and
max
often
smiled
as
though
some
of
the
quaint
expressions
used
by
the
young
narrator
amused
him
though
perhaps
there
may
have
been
still
another
reason
for
his
quiet
chuckling
steve
caught
him
at
it
several
times
and
eyed
the
other
in
perplexity
as
though
he
suspected
max
of
adding
secretly
to
his
fund
of
knowledge
which
thus
far
he
obstinately
declined
to
share
with
his
mates
later
on
when
they
began
to
feel
sleepy
obed
said
he
would
go
out
and
make
sure
his
traps
were
set
right
max
offered
to
keep
him
company
and
together
they
sauntered
forth
to
be
followed
with
a
wistful
look
from
the
envious
steve
who
was
muttering
to
himself
i
wish
i
knew
what
max
has
got
in
that
mind
of
his
right
now
i
dead
certain
he
figuring
out
some
sort
of
thing
that
going
to
give
the
rest
of
us
a
big
surprise
when
he
sees
fit
to
spring
it
on
us
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
guess
what
it
can
be
oh
shucks
what
the
use
of
bothering
any
more
about
it
if
it
turns
out
worth
while
max
will
tell
us
in
good
time
and
if
he
on
the
wrong
scent
why
he
just
drop
the
game
and
no
harm
done
after
a
while
the
others
came
in
again
saying
both
traps
were
set
and
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
need
of
their
losing
sleep
on
account
of
possible
unwelcome
visitors
obed
showed
how
the
concealed
bunks
could
be
made
ready
and
all
of
them
were
loud
in
their
expressions
of
satisfaction
over
having
such
comfortable
lodgings
for
the
night
they
mentally
blessed
the
memory
of
the
said
coombs
whose
forethought
and
inventive
ingenuity
had
planned
all
these
wonderful
adjuncts
of
the
little
forest
lodge
in
due
time
they
crept
into
their
several
berths
just
as
if
aboard
ship
and
after
that
several
of
the
fellows
did
not
know
a
single
thing
until
they
were
rudely
aroused
perhaps
some
hours
later
on
the
last
thing
steve
remembered
hearing
as
he
rolled
himself
up
in
his
blanket
was
the
crackle
of
the
fire
the
mournful
sighing
of
the
wind
through
the
tops
of
the
whispering
pines
and
then
the
distant
call
of
an
owl
to
its
mate
he
awoke
with
a
suddenness
that
caused
him
to
sit
up
and
consequently
crack
his
head
against
the
boards
above
his
bunk
the
blow
almost
knocked
steve
back
again
as
he
had
been
before
and
must
have
hurt
considerably
but
he
ignored
this
fact
just
then
because
from
without
there
were
coming
loud
yells
of
fright
in
a
man
voice
chapter
xi
a
tree
that
bore
strange
fruit
max
obed
we
got
something
almost
shrieked
steve
as
he
now
tumbled
out
of
his
odd
bunk
very
much
after
the
fashion
of
a
dislodged
log
landing
with
a
bump
on
the
floor
and
steve
was
not
alone
in
his
circus
stunt
for
several
other
fellows
were
making
a
hasty
and
undignified
exit
at
the
same
time
and
toby
jucklin
for
instance
max
somehow
managed
to
get
on
his
feet
without
so
much
scrambling
and
as
for
obed
as
he
had
been
sleeping
on
the
cot
closer
to
the
fire
they
could
already
see
him
hastily
pulling
on
some
clothes
get
dressed
and
in
a
hurry
cried
max
suiting
his
actions
to
the
words
oh
listen
to
him
whoop
it
up
will
you
exclaimed
as
those
loud
calls
still
smote
the
night
air
and
in
a
way
that
covered
the
whole
gamut
of
human
utterance
toby
wanted
to
say
something
too
but
though
his
jaws
worked
no
audible
sound
came
forth
to
explain
the
agitated
state
of
his
mind
they
had
luckily
prepared
for
such
a
sudden
call
and
had
their
outer
clothes
handy
so
that
in
an
incredibly
brief
space
of
time
all
of
the
boys
managed
to
get
something
on
then
steve
snatched
up
his
marlin
gun
obed
had
already
done
the
same
with
his
rifle
so
that
when
the
latter
flung
wide
the
door
and
they
trooped
forth
they
were
in
a
condition
to
do
battle
if
necessary
and
at
least
strike
terror
into
the
heart
of
any
skulking
marauder
max
wise
general
that
he
was
had
thought
of
something
very
essential
to
their
success
this
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
lantern
they
had
been
thoughtful
enough
to
fetch
one
along
a
clever
little
contraption
that
took
only
a
small
amount
of
room
and
yet
afforded
considerable
light
besides
obed
possessed
a
lantern
of
the
ordinary
type
together
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
oil
looking
to
the
long
winter
evenings
when
he
might
want
to
read
in
order
to
pass
away
some
of
the
spare
time
that
promised
to
drag
heavily
on
his
hands
so
they
poured
forth
the
cries
still
continued
and
as
vociferous
as
ever
indeed
if
anything
there
was
a
wilder
strain
to
them
now
as
though
the
fellow
who
gave
utterance
to
the
shouts
might
be
getting
sorely
alarmed
at
his
strange
condition
and
feared
the
worst
there
was
no
trouble
about
deciding
which
way
to
go
even
if
they
did
not
have
obed
to
serve
as
guide
and
pilot
the
expedition
they
could
easily
have
followed
the
loud
notes
of
alarm
everybody
was
more
or
less
excited
from
obed
down
to
max
himself
and
small
wonder
when
the
fact
of
their
being
aroused
in
the
dead
of
the
night
by
this
fierce
racket
is
taken
into
consideration
hastening
in
this
manner
toward
the
spot
where
the
first
trap
had
been
set
they
speedily
discovered
that
the
overhanging
tree
bore
strange
fruit
something
grotesque
was
swinging
violently
back
and
forth
it
was
a
human
figure
but
hardly
recognizable
as
such
on
account
of
the
fact
that
it
now
hung
head
downward
with
one
leg
firmly
gripped
by
the
tenacious
and
the
other
together
with
a
pair
of
wildly
flung
arms
cutting
all
sorts
of
eccentric
circles
through
the
air
never
in
all
their
varied
experiences
had
max
and
his
three
comrades
looked
on
a
more
remarkable
spectacle
than
the
one
by
which
they
were
now
greeted
the
man
face
could
not
be
plainly
seen
on
account
of
his
coat
sagging
down
partly
over
his
head
so
they
could
not
immediately
tell
what
he
looked
like
but
he
certainly
possessed
a
voice
that
properly
trained
for
opera
use
might
have
won
him
a
fair
amount
of
fame
and
money
for
it
was
more
than
usually
lusty
he
seemed
to
divine
the
fact
that
those
in
the
cabin
must
have
rushed
out
in
answer
to
his
shouts
perhaps
he
detected
the
light
they
carried
with
them
or
it
might
be
steve
loud
cries
caught
his
strained
hearing
at
such
times
as
his
own
breath
temporarily
failed
him
help
me
somebody
why
do
yuh
i
strangling
to
death
i
tell
yuh
all
the
blood
running
to
my
head
i
seeing
a
million
stars
already
and
i
if
yuh
do
cut
me
down
hurry
hurry
please
do
somebody
obed
looked
to
max
to
say
what
ought
to
be
done
for
already
he
seemed
to
have
come
under
the
magical
sway
of
the
other
leadership
take
hold
of
him
and
tie
his
hands
behind
his
back
before
you
think
to
let
him
down
was
the
sensible
advice
given
by
max
thereupon
obed
instantly
produced
some
heavy
cord
and
started
operations
while
the
boy
deftly
worked
the
man
continued
to
plead
trying
to
claw
at
him
also
but
obed
managed
to
get
his
job
completed
notwithstanding
the
interruptions
he
was
at
the
same
time
telling
the
unfortunate
man
to
keep
quiet
and
he
would
be
let
down
presently
steve
stood
by
gun
in
hand
he
was
casting
uneasy
looks
around
as
though
suspecting
that
if
the
fellow
had
companions
near
by
as
seemed
likely
and
they
should
recovering
from
their
alarm
attempt
his
rescue
it
might
be
his
duty
to
stand
them
off
one
and
collectively
and
toby
sprang
to
where
the
man
dangled
max
was
already
at
the
side
of
obed
all
ready
obed
he
was
heard
to
say
i
spliced
his
hands
up
in
good
style
max
came
the
reply
good
enough
now
toby
and
take
hold
of
him
and
lift
when
i
give
you
the
word
i
slip
the
rope
off
his
ankle
and
you
turn
him
right
side
up
now
go
to
it
both
of
you
it
was
quickly
done
and
the
man
upon
finding
himself
placed
once
more
on
his
feet
staggered
indeed
he
was
so
groggy
after
his
recent
strange
experience
at
swimming
in
thin
air
that
only
for
the
supporting
arm
of
max
he
would
have
fallen
flat
the
latter
allowed
him
to
stagger
backward
until
he
leaned
against
the
body
of
the
tree
under
which
the
novel
had
been
arranged
he
was
breathing
hard
but
seemed
to
be
recovering
from
his
panic
at
least
his
cries
had
utterly
ceased
which
was
one
good
thing
so
max
flashed
the
light
into
his
face
while
obed
leaned
forward
and
eagerly
stared
hard
at
him
they
saw
rough
lineaments
seamed
and
hardened
by
exposure
to
the
elements
but
of
course
the
face
was
that
of
an
utter
stranger
to
max
as
for
obed
he
was
heard
to
give
a
of
disappointment
as
though
he
too
had
failed
to
recognize
any
one
whom
he
had
reason
to
know
the
man
by
now
seemed
to
have
recovered
in
part
he
was
looking
at
the
boys
in
a
peculiar
way
max
could
not
decide
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
whether
it
was
wonder
or
shrewdness
that
he
saw
there
as
the
predominant
trait
of
the
man
features
but
at
any
rate
since
he
had
recovered
his
breath
to
some
extent
he
should
be
capable
of
speaking
and
explaining
how
it
came
about
he
found
himself
in
such
a
predicament
well
who
are
you
anyway
demanded
max
throwing
as
much
sternness
into
his
voice
as
he
could
give
an
account
of
yourself
and
tell
us
why
you
were
creeping
about
here
like
a
thief
in
the
night
what
me
a
thief
shrilled
the
man
as
though
again
excited
by
the
very
idea
of
such
a
base
accusation
i
never
had
that
name
young
feller
them
that
knows
jake
storms
say
he
an
honest
man
if
ever
there
was
one
i
only
a
guide
and
a
trapper
but
nobody
ever
yet
caught
me
thievin
or
poachin
i
have
yuh
know
where
your
home
jake
storms
continued
max
if
yuh
mean
whar
do
i
hang
out
it
this
way
explained
the
other
last
summer
i
was
up
at
paul
smith
place
workin
for
the
hotel
i
heard
some
tall
stories
about
the
country
around
old
mount
tom
how
full
of
fur
animals
it
was
and
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
spend
the
winter
hereabouts
i
built
me
a
cabin
away
up
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
and
was
agoin
to
start
settin
my
traps
when
i
got
word
that
a
gentleman
wanted
me
to
come
down
to
lathrop
and
git
him
yuh
see
his
doctor
advised
that
he
spend
the
winter
in
the
mountains
and
he
thought
of
me
we
been
in
the
woods
a
heap
of
times
in
past
years
so
i
was
headin
for
lathrop
by
a
trail
i
run
across
that
took
around
the
mountain
and
meanin
to
keep
on
as
long
as
i
could
durin
the
night
when
all
at
once
something
flew
up
and
hit
me
say
i
thought
it
was
an
earthquake
sure
i
did
and
then
i
found
myself
hangin
upside
down
with
all
the
blood
runnin
into
my
head
what
it
mean
young
fellers
i
give
yuh
my
word
i
do
get
the
hang
o
it
at
all
max
was
not
surprised
to
hear
the
man
speak
in
this
fashion
he
had
already
made
up
his
mind
after
that
one
good
look
at
the
other
face
the
prisoner
of
the
barrel
trap
was
a
pretty
slick
article
as
steve
would
have
expressed
it
and
caught
in
the
act
as
he
had
been
it
was
to
be
expected
that
the
fellow
would
have
some
kind
of
reasonable
story
to
spin
in
order
to
explain
his
presence
there
all
the
same
max
did
not
give
the
yarn
the
least
credence
something
told
him
the
other
was
deliberately
lying
and
the
fluency
with
which
he
delivered
that
remarkable
story
announced
the
jake
storms
an
accomplished
fakir
if
ever
there
was
one
so
max
while
not
wishing
to
deliberately
tell
the
man
to
his
face
that
he
was
a
prevaricator
set
about
catching
him
in
a
little
trap
the
others
had
also
heard
the
explanation
given
and
were
listening
with
puzzled
looks
on
their
faces
at
least
and
steve
and
toby
were
but
obed
was
shaking
his
head
energetically
as
though
he
put
no
faith
in
fairy
tales
especially
when
coming
from
such
unworthy
lips
you
said
you
were
all
alone
did
you
demanded
max
why
yes
i
was
spluttered
the
other
uneasily
eying
the
speaker
who
was
holding
his
light
so
that
it
shone
directly
on
still
flushed
face
then
what
did
you
shout
so
loud
for
if
you
did
expect
any
one
to
come
to
your
assistance
continued
max
oh
say
yuh
see
i
knowed
thar
was
around
i
just
discovered
signs
of
a
camp
and
sniffed
smoke
but
before
i
had
half
a
chance
to
make
out
what
it
meant
why
something
grabbed
me
by
the
leg
and
threw
me
up
like
i
was
agoin
over
the
treetops
who
would
a
yelled
tell
me
i
own
up
i
was
rattled
like
everything
anybody
would
be
would
they
i
could
understand
it
all
and
right
now
i
still
agropin
in
the
dark
what
struck
me
and
why
does
ye
set
such
traps
in
the
trail
over
on
this
side
o
mount
tom
ai
the
woods
free
for
anybody
to
walk
in
what
have
i
ever
done
to
any
o
yuh
to
be
treated
like
this
and
have
my
head
nigh
jerked
from
my
body
tell
me
that
sonny
max
did
not
answer
his
question
while
the
explanation
might
seem
to
be
fairly
plausible
he
felt
positive
the
man
was
telling
a
downright
lie
and
max
believed
he
knew
an
easy
way
to
prove
it
watch
him
obed
steve
he
said
to
those
who
were
alongside
never
fear
about
that
max
snapped
out
steve
i
got
him
covered
with
my
gun
and
if
he
tries
any
slick
game
his
name
will
be
dennis
and
not
jake
hear
that
fur
thief
do
you
well
mind
how
you
tempt
me
to
let
fly
with
a
charge
of
birdshot
i
got
a
quick
temper
and
a
quicker
finger
in
the
bargain
so
settle
back
where
you
are
the
man
muttered
between
his
set
teeth
he
was
evidently
feeling
far
from
comfortable
because
something
told
him
these
wideawake
lads
would
not
be
so
easily
hoodwinked
as
he
had
fancied
he
was
watching
the
movements
of
max
hastings
who
had
dropped
to
his
hands
and
knees
and
seemed
to
be
holding
his
little
lantern
so
that
the
light
would
show
him
the
nature
of
the
ground
truth
to
tell
max
and
obed
when
last
at
the
trap
had
taken
the
pains
to
smooth
the
ground
over
thus
obliterating
all
previous
footprints
this
was
done
from
a
double
object
it
would
conceal
the
fact
that
work
had
been
carried
on
in
that
particular
spot
in
case
sharp
eyes
were
on
the
alert
and
also
gave
a
clear
field
for
observation
as
was
happening
just
then
max
quickly
found
what
he
was
looking
for
come
here
obed
he
remarked
quietly
and
as
the
other
eagerly
bent
over
max
went
on
to
say
you
can
see
that
here
another
footprint
and
quite
different
from
the
one
made
by
his
heavier
boots
so
he
have
at
least
one
companion
along
perhaps
two
for
all
we
know
and
that
stamps
his
story
a
yarn
made
out
of
whole
cloth
he
came
here
just
as
you
expected
to
rob
you
of
your
foxes
killing
them
would
have
filled
the
bill
so
well
unless
they
made
off
with
the
pelts
in
the
bargain
how
about
it
obed
every
word
you
say
is
true
max
breathed
the
other
indignantly
then
we
certainly
not
let
him
go
free
that
a
dead
sure
proposition
ventured
max
decidedly
and
in
a
voice
that
he
meant
should
reach
the
prisoner
glad
to
hear
you
settle
it
that
way
boys
remarked
steve
who
had
kept
one
eye
on
the
prisoner
and
the
other
in
the
direction
of
his
mates
shall
i
march
him
over
to
the
cabin
right
away
max
gave
a
look
around
he
wondered
where
that
other
man
could
be
just
then
and
whether
he
was
watching
them
from
some
neighboring
covert
having
by
degrees
recovered
from
the
near
panic
into
which
he
had
been
thrown
at
the
time
his
companion
was
snatched
away
from
his
side
so
mysteriously
amidst
a
tremendous
din
caused
by
the
shouts
of
the
seized
man
and
the
rattling
of
the
stones
inside
the
rolling
barrel
but
he
could
see
nothing
the
little
lantern
only
covered
a
certain
amount
of
space
with
its
meagre
illumination
and
much
that
was
evil
might
lurk
beyond
the
radius
of
its
lighted
circle
yes
we
change
our
base
and
go
back
to
the
cabin
max
said
aloud
keep
the
guns
ready
for
business
and
if
an
attack
is
made
shoot
straight
of
course
this
admonition
was
delivered
in
a
loud
tone
mostly
to
warn
the
unseen
party
who
might
be
hovering
near
but
both
gave
evidence
of
meaning
to
profit
by
the
advice
chapter
xii
the
taps
on
the
cabin
wall
once
more
they
were
inside
the
cabin
obed
was
looking
at
the
man
again
as
though
he
believed
the
other
was
possessed
of
certain
information
which
he
hoped
to
obtain
in
turn
max
too
was
observing
all
these
things
with
considerable
interest
if
the
smile
that
appeared
on
his
face
from
time
to
time
signified
anything
but
he
was
studying
obed
even
more
than
he
seemed
to
pay
attention
to
the
man
they
had
found
turned
upside
down
in
the
tree
well
one
of
your
clever
traps
worked
like
a
charm
obed
steve
was
saying
and
doubtless
meaning
to
compliment
the
fur
farmer
but
now
that
they
know
we
on
to
their
being
around
it
hardly
likely
catch
another
victim
tonight
all
the
same
something
ought
to
be
done
to
protect
the
fox
pack
that
easily
arranged
remarked
max
we
follow
out
the
plan
we
talked
over
two
had
better
stand
guard
at
a
time
and
for
several
hours
they
can
be
relieved
by
another
couple
and
in
this
way
the
balance
of
the
night
will
be
passed
over
those
on
duty
are
to
carry
the
guns
and
with
orders
to
challenge
any
moving
thing
that
comes
along
the
man
had
made
no
resistance
when
ordered
to
fall
in
line
and
accompany
his
captors
to
the
cabin
under
the
pines
once
inside
he
had
glanced
casually
around
but
max
noticed
that
he
did
not
seem
greatly
interested
from
this
he
guessed
that
perhaps
the
other
may
have
seen
the
interior
of
the
lodge
before
max
remembered
obed
telling
them
that
some
one
had
certainly
been
prowling
about
in
his
cabin
at
the
time
he
was
away
though
evidently
frightened
off
by
his
return
before
having
a
chance
to
do
any
damage
he
is
looking
at
these
things
so
strange
to
an
ordinary
cabin
in
the
woods
for
the
first
time
was
what
max
was
telling
himself
and
consequently
his
heart
hardened
toward
the
fellow
having
previously
arranged
all
about
signals
that
could
be
given
in
case
of
necessity
there
was
now
little
more
to
be
said
of
course
steve
had
to
be
counted
on
as
one
of
the
pair
to
be
first
placed
on
duty
he
would
have
been
mortally
offended
had
max
failed
to
honor
him
with
this
exhibition
of
trust
then
offered
to
share
his
vigil
and
steve
eagerly
accepted
the
proposal
take
obed
gun
said
max
and
remember
what
i
told
you
about
using
it
shoot
low
so
as
to
fill
their
legs
full
of
lead
if
you
have
to
fire
at
all
and
listen
to
our
shouts
as
we
join
you
for
we
do
want
a
warm
reception
from
our
friends
get
that
both
of
you
steve
and
his
fellow
sentry
admitted
that
they
understood
what
their
directions
were
to
be
then
they
went
out
the
man
had
been
intently
watching
all
these
things
as
though
deeply
interested
since
max
had
found
the
second
series
of
footprints
and
thus
proved
the
falsity
of
his
claim
of
being
alone
jake
storms
woods
guide
and
trapper
of
animals
had
relapsed
into
a
sullen
silence
of
course
he
knew
that
the
game
for
him
was
up
so
far
as
attempting
to
deceive
these
boys
was
concerned
max
wondered
what
thoughts
were
teeming
through
the
brain
of
the
man
as
he
sat
there
on
the
bench
before
the
fire
and
listened
to
what
passed
between
his
captors
as
for
obed
he
cast
many
eager
looks
in
the
direction
of
the
big
fellow
and
from
the
expression
on
his
face
max
believed
he
must
be
slowly
making
up
his
mind
toward
some
move
therefore
he
was
not
much
surprised
to
finally
see
the
woods
boy
sit
down
alongside
the
man
who
turned
an
inquiring
face
toward
him
there
was
also
a
tightening
of
the
muscles
around
his
mouth
just
as
though
he
suspected
he
was
about
to
be
put
to
a
severe
test
and
would
have
to
gather
his
wits
in
order
not
to
make
a
false
move
look
here
jake
storms
as
you
say
your
name
is
commenced
obed
once
more
either
forgetting
to
speak
in
his
usual
woods
dialect
or
not
thinking
it
worth
while
to
bother
with
it
any
longer
i
want
to
make
you
a
proposition
do
you
understand
what
a
nice
pickle
you
got
yourself
into
by
prowling
around
my
fur
farm
and
evidently
trying
to
steal
my
silver
black
foxes
if
we
take
you
down
to
the
nearest
adirondack
town
it
means
you
likely
enough
be
sent
up
as
a
thief
how
would
you
like
that
tell
me
huh
guess
jake
storms
got
a
reputation
that
kerry
him
through
all
right
sonny
muttered
the
big
man
but
max
could
see
that
he
squirmed
uneasily
likewise
obed
must
have
guessed
the
truth
also
as
his
next
remarks
proved
a
reputation
may
be
one
way
or
the
other
jake
storms
if
that
is
really
your
name
which
i
doubt
very
much
perhaps
some
people
might
be
glad
to
see
you
again
for
one
i
do
believe
for
a
single
minute
that
you
a
trapper
or
that
you
ever
worked
for
paul
smith
who
knows
the
kind
of
men
he
has
around
his
hotel
too
well
to
hire
a
thief
i
as
sure
as
i
draw
breath
that
you
came
here
to
steal
my
blacks
yes
and
that
you
were
to
do
this
by
another
party
what
was
the
sum
of
money
he
promised
you
jake
if
you
were
successful
and
is
he
around
here
with
you
the
man
made
no
reply
though
various
expressive
changes
took
place
in
the
looks
on
his
face
so
obed
after
waiting
several
minutes
to
hear
what
the
other
might
choose
to
say
went
on
i
said
before
that
if
we
take
you
down
to
lathrop
you
be
locked
up
and
when
court
is
in
session
placed
on
trial
charged
with
attempted
robbery
your
picture
will
be
taken
and
sent
broadcast
to
every
city
so
if
you
wanted
for
anything
big
the
authorities
will
know
just
where
to
find
you
that
may
not
be
pleasant
for
you
to
hear
jake
but
it
what
i
mean
to
have
done
there
only
one
way
you
can
escape
it
do
you
want
to
hear
what
that
way
is
yuh
away
off
the
track
young
feller
blurted
the
man
obstinately
shaking
his
head
in
a
contrary
way
i
ai
done
nawthin
to
make
me
askeered
o
the
law
officers
jake
storms
is
my
name
all
right
too
and
i
meanin
to
trap
over
on
the
cranberry
creek
section
and
i
on
my
way
down
to
lathrop
right
now
to
meet
a
jasper
who
vouch
for
my
character
sure
he
will
but
go
ahead
and
say
what
yuh
meant
to
boy
it
wo
do
me
any
harm
to
hear
it
i
reckons
this
is
the
chance
you
have
to
get
scot
free
and
the
only
chance
said
obed
solemnly
tell
me
who
hired
you
to
rob
my
fur
farm
and
not
leave
a
single
black
in
the
burrows
and
i
let
you
go
free
will
you
take
my
offer
or
risk
a
prison
sentence
jake
the
man
hesitated
that
alone
was
enough
to
convince
max
that
he
was
guilty
for
undoubtedly
he
must
be
weighing
in
the
balance
obed
offer
with
the
possibility
of
making
his
escape
through
the
assistance
of
companions
ai
got
nawthin
to
say
boy
he
finally
growled
as
though
making
up
his
mind
obed
started
up
and
hastening
over
to
a
desk
at
one
end
of
the
room
he
hurriedly
searched
through
a
drawer
until
he
found
what
he
was
looking
for
after
which
he
again
sat
down
beside
the
man
with
the
tied
hands
it
was
a
photograph
which
he
held
up
before
the
prisoner
and
max
could
see
it
was
a
man
face
on
the
card
look
at
that
jake
storms
and
tell
me
did
put
it
into
your
head
to
come
up
here
and
clean
my
enclosures
out
so
as
to
rob
me
of
the
work
of
nearly
two
years
the
man
started
when
he
allowed
his
eyes
to
fall
upon
the
face
on
the
card
but
recovering
his
nerve
instantly
he
laughed
harshly
and
hurriedly
snapped
i
tell
yuh
it
on
the
wrong
track
yuh
are
boy
why
i
never
set
eyes
on
such
a
person
as
that
thar
he
a
utter
stranger
to
me
and
i
do
know
him
from
adam
and
i
want
to
warn
yuh
that
i
turn
around
and
have
the
law
on
yuh
for
playin
such
a
trick
on
an
honest
man
just
passin
along
through
the
woods
and
never
thinkin
no
harm
to
a
single
soul
i
demands
that
yuh
turn
me
loose
to
go
my
way
the
woods
are
free
as
the
air
to
everybody
that
the
law
further
than
that
i
ai
got
nawthin
to
say
obed
was
plainly
chagrined
as
max
could
see
he
evidently
hoped
to
obtain
some
valuable
information
from
this
man
but
it
seemed
jake
still
clung
to
the
hope
that
he
might
obtain
his
freedom
without
betraying
secrets
max
taking
advantage
of
obed
for
a
minute
or
so
managed
to
lean
slightly
forward
and
obtain
a
good
look
at
the
photograph
it
was
that
of
a
young
man
perhaps
thirty
years
of
age
max
was
struck
with
the
fact
that
the
photograph
certainly
bore
some
little
resemblance
to
obed
himself
and
one
could
easily
believe
they
must
be
related
in
some
way
which
according
to
obed
former
recital
of
his
widely
flung
family
would
make
the
other
a
grimes
also
the
woods
boy
looked
at
the
man
several
times
as
though
wondering
whether
it
would
pay
to
make
any
further
offer
as
an
inducement
to
the
other
to
betray
the
confidence
of
his
employer
but
either
obed
did
not
have
the
ready
cash
to
offer
a
bribe
or
else
he
deemed
it
not
worth
while
after
the
fellow
had
shown
such
a
stubborn
disposition
for
presently
he
gave
a
sigh
and
went
back
to
return
the
photograph
to
the
little
desk
once
doubtless
coombs
property
toby
was
nodding
before
the
fire
and
really
paying
very
little
attention
to
what
was
going
on
in
fact
he
meant
to
crawl
into
his
bunk
shortly
so
as
to
get
a
little
more
sleep
before
being
called
upon
to
take
his
turn
outside
as
sentry
toby
not
having
had
his
suspicions
concerning
obed
aroused
at
any
time
failed
to
take
the
same
interest
in
the
matter
that
steve
for
instance
would
have
done
had
he
been
present
i
hope
yuh
do
mean
to
make
me
set
here
on
this
bench
all
night
with
my
hands
tied
behind
me
so
cruel
like
remarked
the
man
presently
applying
his
words
directly
toward
max
as
though
he
too
had
long
ago
discovered
how
that
energetic
young
chap
seemed
to
be
the
boss
of
the
ranch
why
no
we
do
mean
to
be
at
all
cruel
returned
the
other
an
extra
blanket
you
can
have
i
lay
it
out
for
you
on
the
floor
and
you
can
drop
down
just
when
you
please
but
do
expect
that
meaning
to
unfasten
your
wrists
jake
we
know
a
thing
or
two
and
expecting
to
take
you
down
to
lathrop
tomorrow
to
land
you
behind
the
bars
you
had
your
chance
to
squeal
and
get
off
i
doubt
if
another
comes
your
way
he
did
just
as
he
said
spreading
the
blanket
so
the
man
could
manage
to
roll
over
and
cover
himself
with
its
folds
this
jake
presently
accomplished
max
also
noticed
how
he
lay
with
his
feet
against
the
outer
wall
of
the
lodge
and
wondered
at
it
though
without
any
clear
idea
that
this
had
any
positive
significance
but
time
was
to
tell
toby
had
crept
into
his
cell
which
was
what
had
dubbed
the
several
bunks
built
in
the
walls
of
the
lodge
so
as
to
conserve
room
and
not
be
in
the
way
during
the
daytime
max
on
his
part
did
not
mean
to
follow
suit
he
thought
it
would
hardly
pay
to
try
and
snatch
an
hour
restless
sleep
when
so
much
was
going
on
around
them
and
then
besides
he
did
not
trust
the
prisoner
wholly
believing
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
outside
all
seemed
as
usual
it
was
long
after
midnight
now
and
if
one
listened
carefully
he
could
catch
the
customary
noises
of
the
woods
at
such
a
time
from
the
soft
crooning
of
the
breeze
as
it
sighed
through
the
pine
tops
to
the
occasional
note
of
some
calling
to
its
mate
or
the
plaintive
voice
of
a
hungry
young
coon
waiting
impatiently
the
return
of
its
foraging
mother
obed
had
thrown
himself
down
on
the
cot
but
max
knew
he
did
not
expect
to
lose
himself
in
slumber
several
times
he
saw
the
woods
boy
raise
his
head
and
look
in
the
direction
of
the
sprawling
figure
of
the
man
under
the
spare
blanket
obed
was
undoubtedly
thinking
still
of
ways
whereby
he
might
force
a
confession
from
the
lips
of
the
stubborn
man
apparently
he
seemed
to
be
intensely
interested
in
discovering
whether
there
was
a
power
behind
this
raid
on
his
enterprise
max
remembering
some
things
he
had
heard
began
to
believe
he
could
see
light
in
the
darkness
now
and
from
the
way
in
which
he
chuckled
to
himself
every
little
while
it
might
be
judged
that
his
thoughts
were
agreeable
on
the
whole
surely
a
whole
hour
and
more
must
have
passed
since
steve
and
started
out
to
assume
their
duty
as
guards
over
the
fox
farm
thus
far
nothing
had
been
heard
from
the
videttes
who
were
undoubtedly
carrying
out
their
orders
to
the
best
of
their
ability
max
suddenly
became
aware
that
certain
low
sounds
came
to
his
ears
at
first
he
thought
some
branch
of
a
tree
must
be
tapping
the
low
eaves
of
the
cabin
being
stirred
to
and
fro
by
the
breeze
as
he
listened
further
however
it
struck
max
that
there
was
a
strange
continuity
about
the
sounds
they
seemed
to
come
in
little
fragments
with
a
brief
hush
between
the
boy
was
instantly
reminded
of
certain
experiences
he
himself
had
had
in
using
a
telegraph
key
while
sending
a
message
over
the
wires
or
listening
to
the
sounder
rattle
off
one
from
some
distant
point
rude
and
uncouth
though
the
dots
and
dashes
were
max
quickly
found
that
he
could
make
out
a
positive
word
and
it
was
the
significant
one
of
free
gently
he
managed
to
turn
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
spot
where
the
man
had
lain
down
he
still
seemed
to
be
sprawled
there
under
the
blanket
a
movement
caught
the
eye
of
max
and
he
saw
obed
holding
up
a
finger
at
him
in
mute
warning
thrilled
by
a
sense
of
impending
tragedy
perhaps
max
watched
the
woods
boy
slowly
but
constantly
making
toward
him
obed
moved
with
the
noiseless
nature
of
a
black
snake
creeping
over
the
ground
his
footfalls
were
so
light
that
even
a
trained
ear
could
not
have
detected
them
he
kept
on
toward
max
until
soon
he
had
managed
to
reach
the
other
side
still
those
plain
taps
continued
to
sound
in
regular
rotation
first
coming
from
the
outside
and
then
closer
max
believed
the
man
on
the
floor
was
making
use
of
his
shoe
to
send
a
message
calling
for
help
and
that
some
unknown
party
outside
was
giving
him
words
of
hope
but
obed
had
now
gained
his
side
and
meant
to
whisper
something
in
his
ear
so
max
prepared
to
pay
full
attention
at
the
same
time
he
glanced
toward
the
door
apprehensively
and
was
pleased
to
discover
that
just
as
he
believed
had
been
the
case
the
bar
was
in
position
so
that
entry
could
not
be
made
by
any
enemy
from
without
chapter
xiii
obed
learns
something
there
something
brooding
obed
whispered
the
first
thing
and
then
continued
by
saying
what
are
those
queer
little
taps
max
i
sure
he
has
something
to
do
with
them
he
tapping
the
toe
of
his
boot
against
the
wall
to
send
a
message
explained
the
other
they
are
using
the
telegraphic
code
i
read
the
one
word
so
you
see
there
some
one
outside
the
cabin
and
they
hatching
up
a
scheme
to
get
him
loose
obed
grew
very
much
excited
he
looked
toward
the
door
as
though
inclined
to
immediately
issue
forth
and
investigate
max
thought
the
hope
of
capturing
another
prisoner
was
the
lure
that
tempted
him
on
but
what
could
have
happened
to
steve
and
whispered
the
woods
boy
as
though
suddenly
remembering
the
pair
supposed
to
be
standing
guard
out
there
nothing
has
happened
to
them
depend
on
it
replied
max
but
this
fellow
must
have
been
slippery
enough
to
get
by
them
and
reach
the
cabin
that
all
oh
do
you
think
we
might
manage
it
some
way
or
other
begged
obed
vague
though
his
question
may
have
been
max
had
no
difficulty
whatever
in
understanding
what
he
meant
his
own
thoughts
were
already
ranging
in
the
same
quarter
and
he
could
supply
all
the
missing
words
obed
was
hoping
that
by
suddenly
issuing
forth
they
might
take
the
creeper
by
surprise
and
effect
his
capture
such
a
possibility
apparently
gave
the
woods
boy
considerable
pleasure
even
in
the
anticipation
max
glanced
again
towards
the
door
they
could
creep
noiselessly
over
in
that
direction
while
the
man
on
the
floor
and
his
friend
without
continued
their
singular
exchange
of
signals
remove
the
bar
from
its
place
and
opening
the
door
dash
out
to
take
the
stooping
fellow
by
surprise
but
then
three
would
be
better
than
two
in
such
an
adventure
there
was
toby
jucklin
a
stout
fellow
and
usually
well
primed
for
anything
that
smacked
of
excitement
and
peril
he
must
be
awakened
and
enlisted
in
the
game
so
max
held
up
a
warning
finger
and
stooping
low
again
whispered
i
get
toby
wait
by
the
door
for
us
do
dream
of
going
out
until
we
join
you
with
that
he
silently
slipped
over
to
the
opening
in
the
wall
occupied
by
the
sleeping
toby
jucklin
the
latter
was
easily
aroused
and
when
max
whispered
a
word
of
caution
in
his
ear
he
knew
enough
not
to
cry
out
though
of
course
the
blood
must
have
started
bounding
like
mad
through
his
arteries
indeed
it
was
a
most
singular
thing
to
be
aroused
from
sound
sleep
by
being
told
that
danger
hovered
over
their
heads
and
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
three
of
them
to
sally
forth
so
as
to
surprise
the
enemy
at
work
toby
was
game
however
his
vocal
cords
might
play
tricks
with
him
frequently
and
give
him
heaps
of
trouble
but
when
it
was
a
matter
of
action
toby
took
nobody
dust
as
he
often
boasted
obed
had
meanwhile
managed
to
creep
over
to
the
door
where
he
impatiently
awaited
the
coming
of
the
other
two
the
strange
tapping
sounds
continued
and
evidently
the
man
lying
there
under
the
blanket
had
become
so
deeply
interested
in
what
he
was
trying
to
communicate
or
receive
that
so
far
he
had
failed
to
discover
there
was
any
movement
in
the
cabin
of
course
all
of
the
boys
were
quivering
with
excitement
though
grimly
determined
to
put
their
plan
into
operation
obed
had
already
reached
up
and
taken
hold
of
the
bar
so
as
to
be
ready
to
remove
it
when
joined
by
his
companions
keep
the
bar
whispered
max
it
will
make
a
fine
club
obed
say
when
max
came
back
from
the
tightly
compressed
lips
of
the
woods
boy
whose
eyes
could
be
seen
glittering
eagerly
in
the
firelight
open
up
max
told
him
perhaps
the
door
may
have
made
some
creaking
sound
on
being
drawn
back
either
that
or
else
the
man
chanced
to
free
his
head
from
the
muffling
folds
of
the
blanket
just
then
and
discovered
what
was
going
on
he
gave
a
shout
of
warning
and
the
three
boys
shot
through
the
opening
at
the
same
instant
max
led
the
way
he
had
carefully
noted
the
location
of
the
sounds
and
judged
that
the
interloper
must
be
somewhere
close
to
the
wall
where
jake
storms
lay
so
it
was
in
that
direction
he
leaped
the
stars
wore
shining
brightly
above
besides
this
a
certain
amount
of
light
managed
to
come
through
that
small
window
of
the
lodge
and
help
to
partially
dispel
the
gloom
without
there
he
is
cried
obed
as
they
turned
the
corner
and
discovered
a
figure
in
the
act
of
scrambling
erect
the
trio
rushed
at
the
unknown
who
just
managed
to
gain
a
footing
when
he
found
himself
furiously
beset
there
was
a
tremendous
struggle
the
man
seemed
savage
at
the
thought
of
being
caught
and
struck
furious
blows
toby
at
one
time
managed
to
cling
to
the
back
for
a
brief
moment
but
was
dislodged
by
a
clever
fling
that
sent
him
crashing
against
a
tree
and
made
him
grunt
like
a
hog
that
receives
a
jolt
one
thing
certain
max
could
easily
see
that
the
party
they
were
attacking
must
be
something
of
an
athlete
from
the
way
in
which
he
fought
it
is
not
easy
to
resist
the
assault
of
three
enemies
at
once
since
they
may
attack
from
as
many
directions
and
confuse
his
defense
still
the
way
this
man
struck
out
dodged
tore
himself
free
from
their
clinging
hands
and
conducted
himself
in
general
surprised
max
very
much
indeed
this
kept
up
for
almost
two
full
minutes
with
varying
fortunes
sometimes
it
appeared
as
though
they
were
getting
the
upper
hand
of
the
unknown
and
then
by
a
furious
effort
he
would
break
free
again
only
to
be
once
more
clutched
in
the
midst
of
the
fracas
loud
shouts
close
at
hand
told
that
steve
and
having
heard
the
row
were
rushing
hurriedly
to
the
spot
astonished
beyond
measure
at
the
racket
the
man
must
have
heard
their
cries
and
the
fact
that
his
enemies
were
about
to
receive
reinforcements
seemed
to
give
him
the
strength
of
desperation
for
he
suddenly
tore
himself
free
from
max
leaving
his
coat
in
the
hands
of
the
boy
oh
he
gone
gasped
obed
almost
entirely
out
of
breath
because
of
his
recent
tremendous
exertions
for
a
fact
the
man
had
vanished
almost
as
though
the
ground
had
opened
and
swallowed
him
up
even
astute
max
hardly
knew
which
way
to
look
for
him
then
came
the
other
pair
rushing
up
and
demanding
to
know
what
all
the
row
was
about
as
soon
as
he
could
recover
his
breath
max
tried
to
explain
he
had
to
repeat
it
twice
however
before
could
grasp
the
astounding
fact
that
some
one
had
actually
been
carrying
on
a
telegraphic
conversation
with
their
prisoner
tapping
on
the
wall
of
the
cabin
to
spell
out
the
words
say
you
stringing
us
i
expect
boys
exploded
the
doubter
it
sounds
just
like
a
fairy
story
to
me
but
then
there
some
one
here
because
we
glimpsed
him
disappearing
like
a
falling
star
i
wanted
to
give
him
a
shot
but
i
remembered
what
max
here
said
about
shooting
when
in
doubt
and
we
did
just
know
but
what
it
might
be
one
of
you
but
max
he
got
away
after
all
continued
the
disappointed
obed
as
though
to
his
mind
that
event
overshadowed
all
others
and
i
did
want
to
find
out
if
it
was
any
one
i
knew
i
believe
it
was
on
my
soul
for
at
college
he
always
had
the
reputation
of
being
an
athlete
huh
grunted
toby
rubbing
his
head
ruefully
as
he
came
up
and
limping
in
the
bargain
was
him
all
then
obed
i
do
know
the
but
i
his
on
my
every
of
his
fist
huh
he
an
athlete
every
time
but
do
tell
me
our
prisoner
skipped
out
cried
steve
in
sore
dismay
not
that
we
know
of
unless
he
gone
since
we
dashed
from
the
cabin
max
informed
him
and
as
we
ca
accomplish
anything
standing
here
suppose
we
adjourn
to
the
inside
again
toby
will
want
a
little
soothing
salve
on
his
bruises
and
i
got
a
sore
hand
myself
where
i
struck
him
harder
than
i
meant
to
on
the
back
of
his
head
it
too
bad
too
bad
mourned
obed
following
the
others
toward
the
open
door
such
a
splendid
chance
may
not
come
again
and
i
like
to
know
i
certainly
would
when
they
entered
the
cabin
the
first
thing
all
of
them
did
was
to
look
eagerly
to
see
if
the
man
still
lay
there
upon
finding
that
he
had
not
tried
to
escape
during
all
the
excitement
possibly
being
afraid
he
be
fired
on
they
felt
relieved
anyhow
we
still
got
him
safe
and
sound
declared
steve
exultantly
and
he
may
make
up
his
mind
to
tell
yet
remarked
obed
picking
up
fresh
hope
when
he
finds
that
i
mean
all
i
said
and
that
he
on
the
road
to
prison
the
man
glowered
at
them
though
apparently
he
seemed
fairly
well
pleased
to
find
that
they
had
not
succeeded
in
capturing
his
ally
max
awaited
developments
he
was
satisfied
with
the
way
things
were
going
and
deep
down
in
his
heart
believed
the
thrilling
announcement
he
was
storing
up
with
which
to
startle
his
three
chums
would
not
now
be
long
delayed
i
we
ought
to
go
out
again
and
resume
our
watch
suggested
steve
after
a
short
time
had
elapsed
it
too
soon
for
a
change
and
after
all
that
excitement
none
of
us
feel
a
bit
sleepy
as
for
me
ventured
i
that
wide
awake
i
feel
as
if
i
never
could
go
to
sleep
again
while
we
up
here
in
the
mountains
where
such
queer
things
keep
on
happening
right
along
i
for
obed
ventured
toby
who
it
seems
had
heard
the
lament
of
the
woods
boy
and
could
sympathize
with
him
he
had
to
a
pointer
by
that
streak
of
lightning
but
after
all
the
fellow
was
too
much
for
the
whole
of
us
but
it
made
me
feel
pretty
sure
now
said
obed
brightening
up
perceptibly
that
i
know
who
to
blame
for
all
this
trouble
i
had
a
hint
about
it
before
you
remember
i
told
you
boys
and
while
he
kept
his
face
hidden
pretty
much
all
the
time
he
fought
i
surely
heard
him
say
something
that
struck
me
as
familiar
he
was
a
stranger
certain
of
that
well
said
max
quietly
perhaps
there
may
be
a
way
to
prove
that
please
tell
me
how
max
pleaded
obed
eagerly
the
mysterious
stranger
managed
to
get
away
chuckled
the
other
but
he
was
so
clever
about
taking
all
his
wardrobe
along
with
him
you
remember
oh
his
coat
cried
obed
in
thrilling
accents
i
hung
on
to
that
like
a
leech
now
laughed
max
of
course
i
should
have
been
smart
enough
to
keep
my
fingers
on
the
man
inside
but
he
had
a
slick
way
of
just
slipping
out
of
the
coat
first
thing
i
knew
he
was
gone
leaving
me
holding
the
bag
as
they
say
want
to
take
a
look
at
that
article
do
you
obed
sometimes
men
have
a
fashion
of
keeping
letters
and
documents
in
their
coat
pockets
and
between
us
i
believe
you
find
something
like
that
here
with
these
words
the
speaker
took
up
the
coat
he
had
torn
from
the
back
of
the
unknown
and
tossed
it
carelessly
toward
obed
the
woods
boy
snatched
at
the
garment
eagerly
newly
aroused
hope
could
be
seen
upon
his
face
everybody
watched
to
see
what
the
outcome
might
turn
out
to
be
steve
and
ready
to
withdraw
from
the
circle
and
resume
their
outside
vigil
stayed
their
departure
for
a
brief
period
in
order
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
even
the
jake
storms
had
his
fishy
eyes
fixed
on
obed
as
though
it
mattered
something
to
him
whether
the
latter
learned
the
answer
to
the
conundrum
or
was
obliged
to
let
it
pass
by
unsolved
so
obed
upon
receiving
the
coat
proceeded
to
ram
an
eager
hand
into
the
pockets
one
after
another
when
he
reached
an
inside
one
he
found
a
bonanza
just
as
max
had
anticipated
there
were
some
papers
there
as
well
as
a
bill
book
bending
down
nearer
the
fire
so
that
he
might
the
better
see
obed
glued
his
eyes
on
his
find
a
few
seconds
passed
the
fire
crackled
as
it
began
to
eat
into
the
fresh
fuel
that
had
been
tossed
to
the
red
embers
upon
the
incoming
of
the
party
toby
grunted
once
or
twice
and
continued
to
ruefully
rub
the
side
of
his
head
his
right
arm
one
of
his
thighs
and
in
fact
as
much
of
his
entire
person
as
he
could
conveniently
cover
in
a
short
space
of
time
then
obed
was
heard
to
give
a
low
exclamation
his
whole
manner
was
a
singular
mixture
of
satisfaction
and
anger
evidently
he
had
accomplished
his
set
purpose
and
the
result
had
aroused
conflicting
emotions
within
his
breast
well
have
you
found
out
who
the
man
is
obed
asked
steve
unable
to
curb
his
burning
curiosity
yes
there
no
longer
any
question
about
it
returned
the
other
bitterly
for
here
are
letters
addressed
to
him
i
may
even
take
the
privilege
of
reading
them
tomorrow
for
in
that
way
i
can
perhaps
discover
some
evidence
that
will
force
him
to
stop
this
ugly
business
oh
the
meanness
of
robert
to
strike
this
cowardly
blow
at
me
his
own
cousin
he
a
disgrace
to
the
whole
family
pity
the
poor
grimeses
exclaimed
max
looking
straight
at
obed
with
such
a
queer
expression
on
his
face
that
presently
the
woods
boy
could
not
keep
from
bursting
into
a
laugh
max
you
on
to
me
i
can
see
he
cried
rushing
up
to
the
other
and
holding
out
his
hand
eagerly
i
guessed
for
some
time
that
you
had
your
suspicions
and
now
i
know
it
so
and
max
too
threw
back
his
head
to
indulge
in
a
good
laugh
while
steve
toby
and
with
months
agape
and
eyes
that
were
as
round
as
saucers
simply
gathered
around
and
stared
at
the
two
who
were
shaking
hands
hey
what
all
this
about
i
want
to
know
spluttered
steve
just
as
though
he
meant
to
say
that
no
one
had
any
business
to
have
secrets
from
the
rest
looky
here
obed
since
when
did
you
forget
that
grimes
woods
lingo
you
been
giving
us
right
along
i
beginning
to
smell
a
rat
that
what
i
am
chapter
xiv
a
big
surprise
evidently
steve
was
commencing
to
get
on
the
scent
of
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
but
as
for
toby
and
they
found
themselves
up
against
a
blank
wall
for
aught
they
could
see
instead
of
trying
to
explain
obed
turned
to
max
saying
meekly
you
tell
them
please
wax
it
only
your
due
after
solving
the
puzzle
as
nearly
as
you
have
i
saw
you
turn
back
to
that
book
again
and
scan
my
initials
in
the
front
that
was
why
you
asked
me
if
coombs
first
name
had
been
robert
when
it
was
not
but
it
all
right
and
i
satisfied
i
had
my
peek
of
fun
out
of
it
let
me
tell
you
now
introduce
me
to
your
chums
max
with
the
greatest
of
pleasure
laughed
the
other
as
he
took
hold
of
obed
and
waving
in
a
ceremonious
fashion
with
the
other
hand
he
continued
friends
toby
and
allow
me
to
present
some
one
to
you
whom
you
be
delighted
to
know
is
roland
stood
as
if
riveted
to
the
spot
staring
and
holding
his
very
breath
through
astonishment
toby
jucklin
wanted
to
express
his
amazement
and
also
his
ecstatic
delight
over
the
wonderful
outcome
of
their
mission
but
alack
and
alas
as
so
often
happened
with
toby
while
the
spirit
was
willing
the
flesh
was
lamentably
weak
and
he
could
not
make
a
sound
except
a
sort
of
spluttering
gasp
while
his
eyes
blinked
and
his
face
grew
rosy
red
still
laughing
the
grimes
boy
proceeded
to
grip
hands
with
his
guests
he
acted
as
though
it
might
be
a
introduction
as
it
certainly
was
in
one
sense
i
ashamed
of
the
way
i
bamboozled
you
fine
fellows
and
that
the
honest
truth
he
started
to
say
but
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
i
thought
of
that
obed
grimes
name
and
once
i
gave
it
to
you
i
had
to
follow
up
with
the
lingo
i
guess
i
got
balled
up
more
than
once
for
max
soon
discovered
that
i
did
always
speak
as
a
true
grimes
should
and
that
gave
him
his
clue
yes
i
the
same
roland
you
started
out
to
find
just
to
please
my
dear
old
aunt
bless
her
heart
i
was
planning
to
surprise
them
all
by
appearing
in
town
with
my
five
thousand
dollars
after
i
sold
the
fox
cubs
and
then
claiming
my
share
of
estate
i
guess
it
all
getting
plain
enough
to
you
now
eh
fellows
could
speak
at
last
why
it
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
my
face
obed
i
beg
pardon
roland
and
i
can
never
forgive
myself
for
being
so
easily
taken
in
and
done
for
so
you
thought
to
invest
your
two
thousand
dollars
in
starting
a
fox
farm
did
you
well
it
was
a
daring
venture
and
i
hardly
think
you
would
have
made
the
game
if
you
had
been
lucky
enough
to
meet
up
with
that
splendid
mr
coombs
that
a
certainty
admitted
the
other
who
apparently
was
not
at
all
given
to
boasting
over
his
achievements
yes
i
was
in
great
luck
to
be
able
to
do
coombs
a
favor
and
win
him
for
a
friend
see
what
he
done
for
me
but
all
the
same
i
invested
my
money
in
this
business
and
according
to
our
partnership
agreement
i
am
to
have
the
proceeds
of
any
sales
so
there
can
be
no
slip
of
the
law
to
beat
me
out
of
my
inheritance
if
only
i
can
get
those
precious
pups
to
the
man
who
engaged
them
and
this
rascal
you
called
robert
is
he
the
elder
cousin
who
would
profit
by
your
failure
to
win
out
asked
max
although
he
already
understood
that
this
must
be
true
the
expressive
face
of
their
new
friend
clouded
immediately
i
sorry
to
say
that
it
so
max
he
admitted
those
envelopes
of
the
letters
i
found
in
his
coat
gave
it
away
the
temptation
was
too
great
for
robert
who
always
showed
considerable
jealousy
because
our
uncle
rather
favored
me
and
so
when
he
learned
in
some
fashion
sure
i
do
know
how
that
i
was
in
a
fair
way
of
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
uncle
will
he
must
have
determined
to
try
and
spoil
my
plans
oh
the
cur
snapped
the
indignant
steve
now
seeing
the
depravity
of
the
miserable
plotter
in
full
i
glad
that
some
of
you
managed
to
give
him
a
few
good
licks
before
he
broke
away
and
i
regret
it
to
the
last
day
of
my
life
that
i
did
get
a
chance
to
show
him
and
me
exclaimed
toby
with
a
violent
effort
he
going
to
carry
the
scratches
i
him
on
his
for
a
if
i
known
that
he
was
roland
i
have
dug
a
too
i
only
hoping
roland
as
we
must
call
him
after
this
since
he
dropped
the
grimes
family
when
he
admitted
his
identity
said
this
will
teach
him
a
lesson
and
that
he
leave
me
alone
from
now
on
but
robert
is
a
terribly
persistent
fellow
and
i
afraid
his
failure
may
only
spur
him
on
to
trying
again
never
mind
roland
said
steve
dwelling
almost
affectionately
on
the
name
now
that
he
knew
the
one
who
claimed
it
we
going
to
stand
back
of
you
through
thick
and
thin
if
those
fox
pups
do
eventually
get
to
their
prospective
purchaser
we
have
to
know
the
reason
why
is
that
so
fellows
my
sentiments
exactly
said
max
promptly
me
too
exclaimed
toby
ditto
here
added
i
want
to
say
this
observed
roland
with
a
suspicious
moisture
in
his
fine
eyes
it
was
the
luckiest
hour
of
my
life
when
i
ran
across
this
bunch
of
royal
good
fellows
why
only
for
you
i
as
like
as
not
have
been
because
alone
and
i
never
could
have
stood
out
against
two
clever
and
unscrupulous
schemers
and
i
never
forget
it
as
long
as
i
draw
breath
there
be
some
people
mighty
sorry
though
i
bet
you
hastened
to
add
as
he
looked
roguishly
at
roland
by
which
i
mean
those
poor
grimeses
who
have
lost
tonight
the
brightest
star
in
the
whole
big
grimes
constellation
why
i
can
just
picture
how
they
all
mourn
uncle
hiram
uncle
silas
uncle
nicodemus
and
all
those
other
uncles
and
aunts
with
old
granddaddy
grimes
weeping
harder
than
any
of
the
rest
over
the
bereavement
for
obed
is
no
longer
in
the
flesh
the
comical
way
in
which
said
this
caused
a
general
laugh
why
even
the
wondering
prisoner
on
the
floor
who
of
course
could
hardly
understand
the
joke
had
to
grin
at
the
humorous
expression
on
the
boy
face
oh
i
guess
they
be
able
to
stand
it
if
i
can
ventured
roland
please
do
bear
me
any
malice
fellows
for
having
my
little
joke
you
see
i
used
to
be
quite
a
hand
for
such
things
but
living
all
alone
up
here
did
give
me
much
of
an
opportunity
to
try
any
pranks
and
so
i
was
just
aching
for
a
turn
it
did
do
any
harm
and
afforded
me
some
fun
so
please
forget
it
but
roland
none
of
that
story
you
told
us
about
your
good
friend
coombs
was
made
up
of
course
asked
steve
that
was
every
word
of
it
true
came
the
quick
answer
oh
he
was
the
finest
old
gentleman
you
ever
heard
about
i
grew
very
fond
of
him
and
when
i
received
word
in
a
letter
from
his
housekeeper
that
he
had
died
shortly
after
his
wife
went
it
broke
me
all
up
i
moped
around
here
for
a
whole
week
and
came
near
throwing
the
entire
job
up
then
i
remembered
how
he
had
always
put
such
confidence
in
everything
i
attempted
and
so
i
just
shut
my
teeth
tighter
together
and
said
i
go
through
with
it
or
know
the
reason
why
and
i
have
for
i
on
the
point
of
success
if
only
that
robert
does
upset
the
fat
in
the
fire
at
the
last
hour
well
he
wo
you
can
just
depend
on
that
said
almost
fiercely
here
are
four
standbys
who
are
booked
to
gather
around
and
see
that
you
get
the
fox
pups
to
market
next
time
robert
comes
where
he
is
wanted
he
may
get
a
broken
head
or
something
just
as
bad
for
now
we
know
his
ugly
game
we
not
apt
to
be
over
particular
how
hard
we
hit
all
of
which
must
have
been
very
comforting
to
the
boy
who
had
taken
such
a
big
load
upon
his
young
shoulders
in
the
effort
to
show
what
he
was
made
of
after
all
perhaps
the
eccentric
uncle
who
left
such
a
strange
provision
in
his
will
knew
human
nature
better
than
most
people
do
for
he
had
picked
out
the
very
thing
calculated
to
spur
a
chap
like
roland
to
do
his
best
well
remarked
max
since
we
cast
off
the
numerous
grimes
tribe
and
discovered
the
one
we
were
in
search
of
and
as
the
hour
is
getting
fearfully
late
suppose
we
postpone
further
talk
until
morning
there
remain
a
few
hours
to
be
utilized
in
sleep
steve
you
and
have
filled
out
your
time
as
sentries
yet
suppose
you
hold
for
another
hour
and
then
turn
it
over
to
me
just
as
you
say
max
replied
the
other
i
meant
to
propose
that
anyway
for
the
alarm
broke
out
in
the
middle
of
our
watch
secretly
i
like
robert
to
take
his
courage
in
both
fists
and
sneak
back
this
way
bent
on
further
mischief
do
you
ask
me
why
well
i
delight
to
make
use
of
my
and
let
him
have
a
mess
of
number
ten
shot
at
say
sixty
yards
they
pepper
him
good
and
plenty
at
that
distance
without
actually
endangering
his
miserable
life
max
knowing
the
energetic
nature
of
the
speaker
warned
him
against
being
too
prompt
at
using
his
gun
better
go
slow
about
that
steve
he
remarked
many
a
fellow
has
been
shot
by
mistake
every
season
dozens
fall
victims
to
hunters
who
see
something
moving
and
blaze
away
recklessly
it
might
be
one
of
us
for
all
you
know
so
do
think
of
firing
without
giving
our
signal
steve
solemnly
promised
to
remember
he
knew
the
danger
of
handling
firearms
in
a
reckless
fashion
and
was
not
likely
to
offend
so
presently
with
in
tow
he
went
forth
to
resume
their
interrupted
vigil
max
and
roland
sat
there
by
the
resurrected
fire
for
a
short
time
exchanging
remarks
the
prisoner
lay
on
the
floor
and
as
far
as
they
could
tell
seemed
to
have
given
up
all
hope
of
a
rescue
for
his
heavy
breathing
was
that
of
one
whom
sleep
had
overtaken
finally
max
pointed
toward
toby
who
could
be
seen
lying
on
his
back
in
his
bunk
and
evidently
enjoying
a
fine
time
in
dreamland
we
do
well
to
imitate
his
example
roland
he
remarked
and
as
a
last
word
i
want
to
tell
you
again
how
delighted
we
all
are
over
finding
you
not
only
that
but
discovering
that
you
been
busy
all
these
months
your
aunt
is
worrying
her
head
off
about
you
the
last
words
she
said
were
only
you
do
find
the
boy
and
he
made
a
mess
of
his
attempt
to
win
his
inheritance
tell
him
aunt
sarah
has
a
place
in
her
heart
for
him
and
that
if
only
he
come
back
he
can
be
her
boy
for
keeps
because
i
find
that
i
grown
to
love
him
as
my
own
roland
appeared
to
be
deeply
affected
when
he
heard
this
for
he
winked
violently
a
good
many
times
and
then
smiling
managed
to
say
you
do
know
how
happy
you
make
me
when
you
tell
that
max
for
a
dear
old
soul
and
i
certainly
do
care
for
her
a
great
deal
but
it
pleases
me
also
to
know
i
made
good
and
that
i
can
hold
up
my
head
when
i
show
those
trustees
what
i
done
the
chase
family
blush
just
yet
on
account
of
roland
though
it
ought
to
for
mean
actions
so
they
too
sought
their
beds
such
as
these
were
and
tried
to
forget
all
else
in
sweet
sleep
max
had
a
peculiar
habit
almost
any
boy
can
acquire
it
through
much
practice
and
sometimes
it
comes
in
very
handy
he
was
able
to
impress
it
upon
his
mind
that
he
wanted
to
awaken
at
about
a
certain
time
once
in
a
long
while
this
might
fail
him
but
nine
times
out
of
ten
he
could
hit
it
in
a
most
surprising
manner
many
persons
have
proved
this
perfectly
feasible
and
although
max
began
it
as
an
experiment
of
the
control
of
mind
over
matter
it
had
long
since
passed
that
stage
and
become
a
regular
habit
with
him
accordingly
in
just
an
hour
after
steve
and
had
gone
forth
again
max
was
out
of
his
bunk
and
arousing
toby
who
got
up
rather
loth
to
abandon
his
good
bed
and
pleasant
dreams
still
he
made
no
complaint
unless
his
frequent
yawns
could
be
counted
as
such
but
trotted
at
the
heels
of
max
when
the
other
started
forth
the
night
remained
calm
high
overhead
the
gentle
breeze
still
sighed
among
the
pines
and
whispered
secrets
as
it
passed
through
the
fragrant
green
needles
with
their
attendant
cones
max
took
a
single
glance
aloft
at
the
heavens
and
this
told
him
pretty
close
on
the
hour
for
in
addition
to
many
other
ways
of
the
forest
nomad
and
believer
in
woodcraft
max
had
mastered
the
positions
of
the
planets
so
that
it
was
always
possible
for
him
to
gauge
the
passage
of
time
when
the
night
granted
him
a
survey
of
the
constellations
above
when
he
and
had
advanced
a
certain
distance
max
stopped
and
imitated
the
call
of
a
so
like
the
whinny
of
a
horse
it
ended
up
with
a
peculiar
twist
and
it
was
this
that
would
tell
any
of
the
other
fellows
the
sound
was
intended
for
a
signal
and
did
not
proceed
from
the
real
bird
itself
an
answer
quickly
came
then
a
couple
of
dim
forms
hove
in
sight
being
steve
and
his
fellow
vidette
ready
to
hand
over
the
guns
to
their
successors
and
seek
the
shelter
of
the
cabin
for
a
little
rest
listen
max
said
steve
while
this
exchange
was
taking
place
there
something
queer
out
yonder
aways
and
i
want
you
to
try
and
make
out
what
it
can
mean
how
is
that
demanded
the
other
why
every
little
while
we
thought
we
could
hear
a
distant
strange
cry
like
somebody
in
pain
of
course
it
might
come
from
a
that
we
do
happen
to
be
acquainted
with
but
it
been
worrying
us
a
heap
i
afraid
though
the
wind
has
shifted
latterly
because
we
seem
to
catch
it
so
well
max
hardly
knew
what
to
think
of
what
steve
had
told
him
nevertheless
he
promised
the
other
he
and
toby
would
listen
for
all
they
were
worth
and
see
if
they
might
have
any
better
success
in
recognizing
the
strange
sounds
but
the
minutes
drifted
along
and
at
no
time
were
they
able
to
catch
anything
out
of
the
common
so
finally
they
decided
that
either
it
must
have
been
a
that
had
flown
away
or
else
that
change
in
the
wind
had
kept
the
sounds
from
coming
to
their
ears
chapter
xv
steve
dream
comes
true
did
you
hear
anything
max
that
was
the
very
first
thing
steve
asked
on
the
following
morning
when
he
poked
his
head
out
of
his
hole
in
the
wall
like
a
shrewd
old
tortoise
looking
around
to
learn
if
the
coast
were
clear
we
listened
from
time
to
time
explained
max
but
were
never
sure
that
we
heard
any
strange
sound
it
seems
that
you
must
have
been
impressed
with
it
considerably
steve
to
have
it
on
your
mind
so
i
was
max
and
i
am
right
now
admitted
the
other
frankly
listen
to
me
while
the
rest
are
busy
getting
breakfast
ready
over
at
the
fire
and
his
voice
sank
to
a
confidential
whisper
i
had
a
dream
it
was
so
queer
that
it
should
come
to
me
after
all
that
happened
i
dreamed
that
we
came
on
that
bad
cousin
of
roland
robert
chase
fallen
over
a
precipice
and
was
dying
there
on
the
rocks
oh
it
was
horribly
real
max
and
i
woke
up
shivering
he
was
sorry
too
because
he
had
been
so
wicked
and
was
asking
roland
to
please
forgive
him
and
max
i
been
wondering
whether
that
dream
might
have
come
to
me
to
let
us
know
we
might
do
a
good
deed
if
we
walked
out
that
way
this
morning
you
and
me
saying
nothing
to
the
rest
of
the
boys
max
was
struck
by
the
thought
that
steve
must
have
had
a
pretty
vivid
dream
to
make
him
so
at
the
same
time
he
felt
in
accord
with
the
sentiments
so
aptly
expressed
by
the
other
steve
i
go
you
there
he
hastened
to
say
it
can
do
no
harm
and
may
be
a
fine
thing
are
you
sure
you
know
the
direction
fairly
well
yes
because
i
was
sharp
enough
to
make
a
note
of
it
last
night
max
you
see
at
the
time
the
wind
was
coming
in
a
lazy
sort
of
way
right
out
of
the
west
later
on
it
swung
around
to
the
northwest
which
makes
it
so
sharp
this
morning
good
for
you
steve
the
other
told
him
then
we
head
direct
into
the
west
and
cover
the
ground
for
say
a
mile
coming
back
over
another
route
we
can
call
out
now
and
then
so
if
any
one
heard
us
they
might
answer
but
you
better
hurry
and
get
your
duds
on
because
unless
mistaken
is
meaning
to
sing
out
that
breakfast
ready
and
you
know
the
last
to
the
feast
is
penalized
when
the
supply
runs
short
no
danger
of
that
happening
when
has
anything
to
do
with
the
cooking
chuckled
steve
confidently
which
remark
proved
how
well
those
four
chums
knew
one
another
weak
points
of
course
at
breakfast
most
of
the
conversation
had
to
do
with
roland
and
his
valiant
attempt
to
make
good
he
told
his
new
friends
many
things
that
interested
them
exceedingly
and
which
were
connected
with
his
struggle
their
questions
also
brought
them
quite
a
fund
of
information
concerning
the
habits
of
foxes
and
how
those
who
aim
to
raise
the
valuable
animals
for
the
great
london
fur
market
go
about
the
business
as
for
me
said
who
had
been
doing
considerable
thinking
while
all
this
talk
went
on
i
mean
to
try
and
hunt
up
a
few
of
those
bouncer
frogs
roland
here
says
inhabit
his
marsh
of
course
i
know
that
at
this
time
of
year
they
deep
down
in
the
mud
and
meaning
to
lie
there
till
spring
thaws
out
but
it
may
be
i
can
scare
up
just
a
mess
i
awfully
fond
of
frogs
legs
you
may
remember
boys
they
all
wished
him
luck
steve
advised
him
to
borrow
a
spade
from
the
owner
of
the
woods
cabin
for
he
might
have
to
dig
deep
however
only
grinned
and
showed
no
signs
of
a
change
of
mind
for
once
he
set
his
heart
on
a
thing
and
he
was
apt
to
keep
everlastingly
at
it
until
the
realization
that
it
was
quite
hopeless
would
compel
him
to
throw
up
the
sponge
which
always
did
with
a
bad
grace
so
breakfast
was
finally
finished
and
the
boys
separated
true
to
his
promise
the
frog
hunter
set
out
valiantly
on
his
errand
urged
by
his
love
for
a
dainty
dish
toby
had
agreed
to
assist
roland
look
after
his
fox
brood
for
there
were
many
things
he
did
not
yet
understand
concerning
their
care
and
which
he
earnestly
wished
to
know
this
arrangement
quite
suited
steve
and
max
for
it
left
them
free
to
saunter
forth
they
announced
their
intention
of
taking
a
little
look
around
steve
of
course
picked
up
his
gun
before
starting
saying
you
never
know
when
you
may
want
a
shooting
iron
up
in
the
woods
there
might
be
an
old
wildcat
prowling
around
these
diggings
which
would
take
a
dislike
to
the
shape
of
my
face
so
he
attack
us
and
i
homely
enough
as
it
is
right
now
without
inviting
a
cat
to
make
the
map
of
ireland
over
my
phiz
he
and
max
showed
no
signs
of
being
in
any
unusual
hurry
as
they
left
the
cabin
they
started
directly
toward
the
west
and
once
out
of
sight
of
those
left
behind
steve
quickened
his
pace
a
bit
at
least
he
chirked
up
and
began
to
show
more
animation
a
mile
you
said
max
did
you
he
asked
why
yes
that
ought
to
fully
cover
the
distance
came
the
reply
i
should
think
you
could
have
caught
any
ordinary
sound
even
as
far
as
that
still
when
the
night
is
calm
it
is
wonderful
how
far
even
a
groan
will
carry
the
atmosphere
seems
to
be
in
a
peculiar
condition
at
such
times
and
acts
as
a
splendid
medium
for
conveying
sounds
they
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
as
they
advanced
nothing
escaped
the
eyes
of
those
two
chums
accustomed
to
the
great
outdoors
as
they
were
and
having
long
ago
graduated
in
a
knowledge
of
woodcraft
some
little
time
passed
thus
they
had
so
far
seen
and
heard
nothing
calculated
to
impress
them
though
steve
was
just
as
sure
the
sounds
he
caught
on
the
preceding
night
must
have
been
a
human
voice
crying
out
in
anguish
doubtless
that
vivid
dream
was
also
making
quite
an
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
boy
for
max
found
him
unusually
docile
and
thoughtful
they
had
now
gone
considerably
over
half
a
mile
max
felt
that
if
any
discovery
was
going
to
be
made
it
must
come
very
soon
he
raised
his
voice
occasionally
and
gave
a
half
shout
after
which
both
of
them
would
stand
still
and
strain
their
hearing
in
hopes
of
catching
some
answering
hail
squirrels
barked
at
the
intruders
of
their
nut
domain
blue
jays
screamed
harshly
as
they
flitted
from
limb
to
limb
among
adjacent
trees
crows
sent
forth
many
noisy
caws
from
atop
of
some
neighboring
pine
watching
those
moving
figures
suspiciously
the
while
and
once
a
deer
suddenly
leaped
across
the
trail
with
a
flip
of
its
short
tail
to
speedily
vanish
amidst
the
colored
foliage
of
some
bushes
this
last
event
caused
steve
to
give
a
real
yell
he
was
so
startled
hardly
had
he
done
this
than
he
gripped
the
sleeve
of
his
comrade
did
you
hear
that
max
was
it
an
echo
to
my
whoop
or
did
somebody
really
call
out
in
a
weak
voice
anyway
it
seemed
to
come
from
right
over
there
and
he
pointed
confidently
as
he
spoke
max
himself
was
of
the
same
opinion
for
he
felt
almost
certain
that
a
human
voice
had
tried
to
attract
their
attention
though
possibly
the
person
giving
utterance
to
the
cry
was
so
weak
that
he
could
not
make
much
effort
they
changed
their
course
a
little
and
headed
directly
toward
the
region
whence
steve
had
pointed
so
positively
when
max
held
the
other
up
presently
and
called
again
all
doubt
was
removed
here
this
way
i
in
pretty
bad
shape
i
guess
do
leave
me
please
whoever
you
are
i
pay
you
a
hundred
dollars
to
get
me
out
of
this
scrape
evidently
the
speaker
whom
max
decided
must
be
robert
chase
and
no
other
supposed
the
persons
approaching
and
whose
voices
he
had
heard
must
be
woods
guides
who
might
consider
themselves
fortunate
indeed
to
earn
such
a
royal
sum
so
easily
two
minutes
afterwards
and
the
boys
found
him
he
must
have
fallen
into
the
hole
while
hurrying
through
the
forest
after
breaking
away
from
the
grip
of
the
boys
at
the
cabin
he
had
been
severely
cut
by
a
sharp
rock
and
lost
considerable
blood
which
weakened
him
so
that
as
he
afterwards
confessed
to
them
he
must
have
swooned
away
and
lain
there
for
hours
unaware
of
his
perilous
condition
the
two
boys
soon
managed
to
get
the
young
man
up
on
level
ground
as
often
happened
it
was
max
who
conceived
the
easiest
way
of
doing
this
to
lift
a
dead
weight
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
is
no
light
task
and
so
he
started
to
break
away
one
side
of
the
pit
thus
raising
the
bottom
of
the
interior
until
they
were
able
to
simply
robert
out
of
the
hole
steve
was
loud
in
his
expressions
of
admiration
whoever
else
would
have
thought
up
such
a
clever
piece
of
business
max
but
you
he
went
on
to
say
as
they
rested
after
their
effort
why
if
it
been
me
in
charge
now
i
reckon
i
have
gone
to
all
sorts
of
trouble
rigging
up
some
sort
of
so
as
to
hoist
him
up
but
you
just
knock
down
a
part
of
the
wall
and
there
you
are
as
neat
as
wax
wherever
did
you
learn
that
trick
i
want
to
know
max
you
laugh
if
i
tell
you
chuckled
the
other
one
day
in
reading
about
how
some
musty
old
professors
are
digging
out
all
sorts
of
weighty
treasures
belonging
to
bygone
days
over
in
egypt
i
chanced
to
learn
how
a
certain
arab
contracted
to
excavate
a
big
stone
weighing
ever
so
many
tons
and
which
the
learned
savant
could
not
see
how
they
were
ever
going
to
get
out
of
the
deep
hole
well
that
arab
just
kept
filling
up
the
hole
and
lifting
the
stone
inch
by
inch
when
he
finished
there
was
no
hole
but
the
great
rock
stood
on
level
ground
and
that
steve
they
say
is
mechanical
engineering
which
has
never
been
beaten
in
these
modern
days
the
pyramids
were
built
in
that
simple
way
human
lives
and
labor
counted
for
little
in
those
old
times
all
i
can
say
is
max
it
takes
you
to
apply
whatever
you
read
to
working
out
your
own
problems
but
however
are
we
going
to
get
this
man
back
to
the
cabin
must
we
build
a
litter
and
carry
him
robert
seemed
to
be
suffering
from
something
more
than
physical
anguish
a
tortured
mind
can
stab
even
more
keenly
than
painful
bodily
wounds
lying
there
and
facing
possible
death
robert
chase
had
evidently
seen
a
great
light
he
beckoned
to
the
boys
to
bend
over
him
and
then
in
a
weak
voice
went
on
to
say
i
do
know
just
how
badly
i
hurt
young
fellows
but
i
do
know
that
i
done
with
this
miserable
business
i
got
just
what
i
deserve
and
it
may
be
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
during
the
time
i
lay
here
and
had
my
senses
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
my
cousin
roland
to
forgive
me
and
let
me
make
amends
for
the
evil
i
tried
to
do
i
know
now
that
it
does
pay
in
the
long
run
for
i
come
near
losing
all
my
yes
get
me
to
the
camp
if
you
can
i
want
to
face
the
music
and
have
it
over
with
something
seems
to
tell
me
that
the
boy
is
the
one
to
hold
a
grudge
against
a
chap
who
been
punished
already
for
doing
an
evil
deed
that
sort
of
talk
pleased
max
immensely
he
saw
that
robert
chase
must
have
been
having
a
terrible
conflict
between
his
better
nature
and
the
insatiate
craving
for
wealth
and
now
that
a
wise
providence
had
stepped
in
to
nip
all
his
plots
in
the
bud
why
things
began
to
look
very
bright
all
around
it
was
found
that
with
one
of
the
boys
on
either
side
robert
could
manage
to
walk
fairly
well
although
they
often
had
to
stop
and
let
him
rest
it
took
them
a
full
two
hours
to
get
back
to
the
cabin
where
their
arrival
created
considerable
excitement
at
the
moment
roland
was
out
somewhere
attending
to
his
pets
and
so
the
injured
man
was
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
by
toby
and
the
latter
of
whom
had
just
come
in
carrying
a
pretty
fair
mess
of
frogs
legs
all
dressed
for
the
then
when
roland
came
along
to
be
told
what
had
happened
and
how
his
cousin
was
anxious
to
see
him
alone
he
looked
actually
pleased
at
the
queer
turn
affairs
had
taken
he
went
in
and
was
with
robert
for
quite
a
long
time
they
must
have
had
a
good
talk
for
when
roland
appeared
again
he
was
smiling
broadly
and
hastened
to
say
we
not
only
patched
up
a
truce
boys
but
made
an
enduring
covenant
after
this
there
not
going
to
be
any
war
in
the
chase
family
and
now
that
robert
has
humbled
himself
to
confess
his
i
believe
we
going
to
be
the
best
of
friends
i
promised
him
without
his
asking
it
that
i
never
tell
a
single
soul
about
what
happened
up
here
you
must
agree
to
the
same
thing
for
my
sake
i
feel
sure
all
like
robert
when
you
get
to
know
him
who
can
tell
muttered
toby
as
if
to
himself
in
time
we
might
even
with
him
stranger
things
than
that
have
happened
i
only
hope
he
wo
hold
a
against
me
when
he
sees
the
mark
of
all
my
down
his
face
just
now
toby
he
is
in
a
mood
to
bear
anybody
a
grudge
roland
went
on
to
say
for
he
believes
he
did
get
half
that
he
merited
but
after
all
it
come
out
a
thousand
per
cent
better
than
i
ever
dreamed
it
would
and
when
i
start
off
with
my
pair
of
grown
cubs
i
need
be
afraid
of
any
one
waylaying
me
on
the
road
all
the
same
observed
steve
raising
his
heavy
eyebrows
suggestively
we
see
to
it
that
you
have
plenty
of
company
on
the
way
since
the
object
of
our
trip
up
here
into
the
heart
of
the
adirondacks
has
been
fulfilled
i
rather
reckon
we
be
wanting
to
go
along
with
you
to
see
the
fox
pups
handed
over
and
that
lovely
check
received
afterwards
we
can
all
start
for
carson
where
you
and
your
good
old
aunt
may
have
a
family
reunion
all
to
yourselves
unless
you
see
fit
to
invite
uncle
sephus
uncle
nicodemus
uncle
job
or
some
of
those
old
worthies
to
join
with
you
so
as
to
make
things
hum
they
all
laughed
at
steve
humorous
remark
what
to
be
with
this
thing
demanded
toby
pointing
as
he
spoke
to
their
prisoner
who
was
sitting
outside
the
door
having
one
of
his
ankles
held
fast
with
a
trailing
rope
so
that
he
could
not
run
away
even
if
tempted
to
do
so
which
considering
his
helpless
condition
with
both
hands
tied
behind
his
back
he
was
hardly
in
the
humor
to
do
chapter
xvi
the
fur
farmer
triumph
conclusion
while
all
this
talk
was
going
on
the
man
had
of
course
listened
what
he
had
just
heard
roland
say
about
forgiving
his
scheming
cousin
must
have
encouraged
the
fellow
more
or
less
for
surely
if
they
meant
to
let
the
chief
conspirator
go
it
would
hardly
be
fitting
to
take
it
out
on
the
poor
hired
tool
i
hope
you
include
me
in
that
general
amnesty
order
young
fellows
he
now
hastened
to
say
with
a
wishful
look
on
his
face
since
the
fat
is
in
the
fire
i
ready
to
tell
anything
you
want
of
me
course
my
name
is
jake
storms
though
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
inform
you
what
it
might
be
because
that
does
concern
anybody
around
here
i
needed
money
pretty
badly
and
the
gent
tempted
me
beyond
my
limit
so
i
agreed
to
help
him
steal
the
fox
cubs
i
was
to
have
all
they
fetch
when
sold
and
so
i
came
along
but
if
you
just
cut
these
cords
and
tell
me
to
clear
out
i
vamose
the
ranch
instanter
max
nodded
his
head
in
the
affirmative
you
might
as
well
make
an
early
start
he
remarked
drily
since
things
have
turned
out
the
way
they
have
we
could
make
any
use
of
you
but
before
you
go
understand
one
thing
my
friend
what
might
that
be
young
fellow
asked
the
other
though
looking
very
much
pleased
at
hearing
he
would
be
set
free
do
get
it
into
your
head
that
it
going
to
be
an
easy
snap
to
come
back
here
and
rob
this
fox
farm
you
be
a
fool
to
try
it
for
many
reasons
in
the
first
place
silver
blacks
are
so
few
in
number
that
any
one
selling
a
cub
or
a
pelt
can
be
tracked
and
made
to
prove
ownership
there
also
an
association
forming
that
will
insure
these
costly
animals
and
chase
a
thief
across
the
continent
until
they
eventually
get
him
just
as
the
bankers
association
does
understand
that
oh
do
bother
about
me
the
man
hastened
to
tell
them
i
through
with
this
sort
of
risky
game
i
can
make
a
living
at
something
that
brings
in
easier
returns
only
set
me
free
and
i
never
come
back
here
again
never
on
your
life
there
be
a
guard
here
while
we
gone
continued
max
sternly
a
man
who
can
hit
a
silver
quarter
with
his
rifle
as
far
as
he
can
see
it
through
the
telescopic
globe
sight
it
would
be
safe
for
prowlers
to
show
up
here
besides
they
could
never
find
the
foxes
hidden
deep
down
in
their
burrows
during
the
night
time
steve
set
him
free
please
the
boys
felt
that
they
could
afford
to
be
magnanimous
since
things
had
taken
such
a
glorious
turn
in
their
favor
so
they
not
only
gave
the
jake
storms
his
liberty
but
filled
his
pockets
with
such
food
as
would
serve
him
until
he
came
to
a
town
roland
was
seen
talking
with
him
just
before
he
left
and
max
felt
sure
the
boy
must
have
thrust
some
money
into
the
man
hand
for
the
fellow
acted
as
though
greatly
confused
and
shook
his
head
while
walking
hastily
away
as
though
the
kindness
of
those
boys
quite
overwhelmed
him
roland
continued
his
work
of
making
his
cousin
thoroughly
ashamed
of
his
recent
mean
actions
he
waited
on
the
injured
man
as
though
robert
had
always
been
one
of
his
best
friends
if
ever
a
fellow
heaped
coals
of
fire
on
the
head
of
his
enemy
roland
chase
certainly
did
during
the
three
days
they
continued
to
linger
at
the
lodge
under
the
pines
meanwhile
the
signal
had
been
set
for
jerry
stocks
to
come
over
and
when
he
arrived
he
turned
out
to
be
very
much
the
kind
of
a
man
the
boys
expected
to
see
a
homely
specimen
of
a
woodsman
honest
as
the
day
was
long
and
filled
to
the
brim
as
steve
aptly
expressed
it
with
an
accurate
knowledge
of
all
such
things
as
may
prove
of
value
to
one
who
roams
the
wilderness
he
was
to
be
left
in
charge
during
the
absence
of
the
young
fur
farmer
roland
had
long
ago
won
the
sincere
admiration
of
the
rugged
woodsman
who
stood
ready
to
do
anything
to
show
his
regard
besides
he
would
be
well
paid
for
all
his
trouble
and
his
family
might
even
come
over
to
visit
him
occasionally
during
the
balance
of
their
stay
under
the
sheltering
roof
of
the
wonderful
little
lodge
under
the
whispering
pines
the
boys
made
use
of
every
hour
in
order
to
enjoy
their
limited
holiday
since
success
had
crowned
their
efforts
to
find
the
missing
one
they
were
in
constant
high
spirits
it
always
produces
a
feeling
of
exultation
to
know
that
the
goal
has
been
attained
for
which
a
start
was
made
and
the
four
chums
were
only
human
they
certainly
had
a
great
time
of
it
visiting
all
sorts
of
strange
nooks
under
the
guidance
of
either
roland
or
jerry
max
found
a
number
of
opportunities
to
add
to
his
interesting
collection
of
flashlight
pictures
he
made
a
specialty
of
the
fox
farm
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
young
owner
managed
to
snap
off
the
timid
occupants
of
the
enclosures
in
the
act
of
feeding
as
well
as
under
various
other
equally
instructive
conditions
all
of
which
would
give
a
pretty
good
idea
of
how
progressive
fur
farmers
manage
their
outfit
the
wounded
man
grew
better
so
that
when
it
was
time
for
them
to
leave
he
could
take
his
part
in
the
procession
though
the
others
declined
to
let
him
burden
himself
with
any
of
the
duffle
since
he
was
still
weak
max
had
been
studying
robert
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
young
man
was
heartily
ashamed
of
his
miserable
plotting
he
hoped
it
would
be
a
good
lesson
calculated
to
serve
robert
the
rest
of
his
life
and
if
this
turned
out
to
be
so
then
that
stumble
of
his
unfortunate
as
it
may
have
seemed
to
him
at
the
time
was
the
best
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
him
the
two
marketable
fox
pups
were
placed
securely
in
the
cage
that
had
been
secured
for
this
very
purpose
by
roland
when
last
in
the
city
it
weighed
very
little
and
could
be
easily
transported
like
an
ordinary
pack
on
the
back
roland
himself
meant
to
carry
it
but
of
course
the
others
insisted
on
spelling
him
from
time
to
time
really
when
the
fateful
morning
hour
came
and
they
turned
back
to
give
a
last
fond
look
at
the
little
lodge
under
the
green
pines
max
and
his
three
chums
were
conscious
of
a
strange
feeling
of
keen
regret
around
the
region
of
their
hearts
which
proved
how
the
woods
home
of
roland
had
grown
upon
them
i
certainly
do
hope
those
pictures
will
turn
out
to
be
daisies
max
steve
was
heard
to
say
most
earnestly
because
i
take
a
heap
of
satisfaction
in
recalling
many
of
the
pleasant
things
that
have
happened
to
us
up
here
where
the
breeze
is
always
telling
tales
to
the
pinetops
and
it
nice
to
be
able
to
see
what
your
mind
is
centered
on
but
look
here
said
roland
delighted
to
hear
steve
talk
in
that
strain
you
must
think
that
even
if
i
do
succeed
to
that
jolly
little
fortune
left
by
my
real
uncle
and
not
one
of
the
grimeses
that
i
meaning
to
drop
this
fox
farm
business
by
now
it
got
a
deep
hold
on
me
and
i
more
bent
than
ever
on
making
it
a
big
success
yes
and
i
also
counting
on
you
fellows
paying
me
another
visit
some
other
time
the
sooner
the
better
they
assured
him
it
would
please
them
beyond
measure
to
contemplate
spending
part
of
their
next
summer
vacation
with
him
when
they
could
investigate
still
further
the
many
delightful
mysteries
of
the
adirondack
wilderness
so
the
lovely
nook
was
lost
sight
of
and
for
some
little
time
a
silence
seemed
to
fall
upon
all
the
members
of
the
group
as
they
continued
to
trudge
along
the
trail
that
eventually
would
fetch
them
to
a
road
and
after
that
to
a
village
of
course
our
story
nears
its
end
now
that
we
have
seen
max
and
his
chums
accomplish
the
object
of
their
search
they
meant
to
continue
along
in
the
company
of
roland
and
see
that
the
pair
of
beautiful
glossy
silver
black
fox
pups
were
safely
delivered
to
the
purchaser
who
intended
to
start
a
fur
farm
of
his
own
in
some
other
part
of
the
country
possibly
away
up
in
the
canadian
northwest
and
had
taken
a
great
fancy
for
the
particular
strain
of
animal
roland
was
propagating
in
due
time
they
arrived
at
the
city
where
this
rich
gentleman
lived
he
had
it
appeared
seen
and
admired
the
fox
pups
while
fishing
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
fur
farm
and
made
a
contract
with
roland
for
the
delivery
of
the
pair
at
a
certain
time
binding
the
bargain
with
a
cash
payment
it
all
turned
out
as
planned
and
when
the
boy
received
the
balance
of
the
stipulated
amount
in
a
handsome
check
he
felt
that
he
had
a
right
to
feel
proud
of
his
accomplishment
robert
had
long
before
then
took
his
leave
and
in
doing
so
he
squeezed
the
hand
of
his
younger
cousin
and
assuring
roland
that
he
meant
to
see
more
of
him
in
the
future
so
far
as
max
could
observe
the
man
appeared
to
have
turned
over
a
new
leaf
and
from
that
time
forward
was
likely
to
show
what
was
really
in
him
besides
his
former
desire
to
loaf
and
spend
money
and
so
in
the
fullness
of
time
the
five
boys
turned
up
in
carson
where
a
certain
good
woman
whom
roland
claimed
as
his
aunt
was
wonderfully
well
pleased
to
find
his
arms
about
her
wrinkled
neck
and
his
boyish
kiss
pressed
upon
her
cheek
she
assured
roland
the
first
thing
that
there
was
no
need
of
his
worrying
about
the
future
because
she
had
determined
to
make
him
her
heir
regardless
of
whether
he
ever
came
into
the
money
left
under
such
exacting
conditions
by
his
deceased
uncle
naturally
roland
was
proud
to
tell
his
aunt
that
while
he
appreciated
her
fresh
interest
in
his
career
and
would
be
only
too
glad
to
respond
to
her
affection
at
the
same
time
she
must
know
he
had
not
made
a
failure
and
that
even
now
he
was
about
to
call
upon
the
trustees
of
the
will
to
show
them
he
had
faithfully
carried
out
all
the
provisions
upon
the
fulfillment
of
which
his
legacy
depended
it
all
came
out
as
planned
indeed
those
same
old
trustees
of
the
estate
living
in
another
town
had
the
greatest
surprise
of
their
lives
when
that
troop
of
boys
called
upon
them
and
the
whole
story
was
told
for
of
course
max
and
the
other
trio
eagerly
snapped
at
roland
warm
invitation
to
accompany
him
on
this
momentous
occasion
so
as
to
witness
his
crowning
triumph
and
add
their
testimony
if
needed
as
witnesses
to
the
successful
outcome
of
his
plans
roland
had
taken
pains
to
gather
all
necessary
documents
showing
how
he
invested
the
greater
part
of
his
two
thousand
dollars
and
how
he
was
to
draw
half
the
proceeds
on
any
sales
he
also
had
the
contract
for
the
delivery
of
the
first
of
the
silver
black
fox
pups
and
after
could
in
addition
show
the
fat
check
covering
that
particular
sale
everything
had
been
looked
after
to
a
fraction
the
old
men
found
it
difficult
to
believe
what
at
first
to
their
minds
seemed
so
like
a
fairy
story
but
in
the
end
they
had
to
admit
that
roland
chase
had
fully
complied
with
every
one
of
the
conditions
imposed
on
him
in
the
strange
will
of
his
uncle
and
as
the
time
limit
had
not
yet
expired
he
was
fully
entitled
to
his
legacy
which
in
due
time
was
paid
over
to
him
after
that
roland
again
departed
for
the
wonderful
farm
where
the
most
valuable
crop
ever
heard
of
was
being
grown
successfully
the
other
lads
heard
from
him
frequently
during
the
winter
months
and
there
was
no
discouraging
report
forthcoming
he
now
had
jerry
with
him
constantly
as
his
assistant
the
guide
having
built
a
cabin
near
the
farm
where
he
installed
his
family
it
was
nicer
for
roland
too
since
there
were
several
children
and
he
could
spend
many
an
evening
sociably
having
taken
up
a
phonograph
with
him
together
with
a
fine
supply
of
all
sorts
of
records
suitable
for
amusing
a
mixed
company
max
often
allowed
his
thoughts
to
bridge
the
many
miles
that
separated
carson
from
that
lodge
in
the
wilderness
and
it
required
no
wand
to
enable
him
to
see
in
his
mind
eye
the
delightful
surroundings
that
made
the
strange
fur
farm
a
possible
el
dorado
where
fortune
was
liable
to
knock
on
the
door
and
demand
entrance
it
is
with
more
or
less
regret
that
the
writer
finds
he
has
reached
the
point
where
he
must
say
goodbye
and
he
only
does
so
with
the
understanding
that
just
as
soon
as
further
stirring
events
worth
narrating
come
to
pass
it
will
be
his
pleasure
as
well
as
duty
to
place
them
between
the
covers
of
another
book
in
this
series
the
end
oblong
some
years
ago
i
engaged
passage
from
charleston
to
the
city
of
new
york
in
the
fine
independence
captain
hardy
we
were
to
sail
on
the
fifteenth
of
the
month
june
weather
permitting
and
on
the
fourteenth
i
went
on
board
to
arrange
some
matters
in
my
stateroom
i
found
that
we
were
to
have
a
great
many
passengers
including
a
more
than
usual
number
of
ladies
on
the
list
were
several
of
my
acquaintances
and
among
other
names
i
was
rejoiced
to
see
that
of
cornelius
wyatt
a
young
artist
for
whom
i
entertained
feelings
of
warm
friendship
he
had
been
with
me
a
at
c
university
where
we
were
very
much
together
he
had
the
ordinary
temperament
of
genius
and
was
a
compound
of
misanthropy
sensibility
and
enthusiasm
to
these
qualities
he
united
the
warmest
and
truest
heart
which
ever
beat
in
a
human
bosom
i
observed
that
his
name
was
carded
upon
staterooms
and
upon
again
referring
to
the
list
of
passengers
i
found
that
he
had
engaged
passage
for
himself
wife
and
two
sisters
his
own
the
staterooms
were
sufficiently
roomy
and
each
had
two
berths
one
above
the
other
these
berths
to
be
sure
were
so
exceedingly
narrow
as
to
be
insufficient
for
more
than
one
person
still
i
could
not
comprehend
why
there
were
staterooms
for
these
four
persons
i
was
just
at
this
epoch
in
one
of
those
moody
frames
of
mind
which
make
a
man
abnormally
inquisitive
about
trifles
and
i
confess
with
shame
that
i
busied
myself
in
a
variety
of
and
preposterous
conjectures
about
this
matter
of
the
supernumerary
stateroom
it
was
no
business
of
mine
to
be
sure
but
with
none
the
less
pertinacity
did
i
occupy
myself
in
attempts
to
resolve
the
enigma
at
last
i
had
not
arrived
at
it
before
it
is
a
servant
of
course
i
said
what
a
fool
i
am
not
sooner
to
have
thought
of
so
obvious
a
solution
and
then
i
again
repaired
to
the
list
but
here
i
saw
distinctly
that
servant
was
to
come
with
the
party
although
in
fact
it
had
been
the
original
design
to
bring
one
for
the
words
and
servant
had
been
first
written
and
then
overscored
oh
extra
baggage
to
be
sure
i
now
said
to
myself
something
he
wishes
not
to
be
put
in
the
hold
something
to
be
kept
under
his
own
eye
ah
i
have
it
a
painting
or
so
and
this
is
what
he
has
been
bargaining
about
with
ficolino
the
italian
jew
this
idea
satisfied
me
and
i
dismissed
my
curiosity
for
the
nonce
wyatt
two
sisters
i
knew
very
well
and
most
amiable
and
clever
girls
they
were
his
wife
he
had
newly
married
and
i
had
never
yet
seen
her
he
had
often
talked
about
her
in
my
presence
however
and
in
his
usual
style
of
enthusiasm
he
described
her
as
of
surpassing
beauty
wit
and
accomplishment
i
was
therefore
quite
anxious
to
make
her
acquaintance
on
the
day
in
which
i
visited
the
ship
the
fourteenth
wyatt
and
a
party
were
also
to
visit
it
so
the
captain
informed
me
and
i
waited
on
board
an
hour
longer
than
i
had
designed
in
hope
of
being
presented
to
the
bride
but
then
an
apology
came
was
a
little
indisposed
and
would
decline
coming
on
board
until
at
the
hour
of
sailing
the
morrow
having
arrived
i
was
going
from
my
hotel
to
the
wharf
when
captain
hardy
met
me
and
said
that
owing
circumstances
a
stupid
but
convenient
phrase
he
rather
thought
the
independence
would
not
sail
for
a
day
or
two
and
that
when
all
was
ready
he
would
send
up
and
let
me
know
this
i
thought
strange
for
there
was
a
stiff
southerly
breeze
but
as
the
circumstances
were
not
forthcoming
although
i
pumped
for
them
with
much
perseverance
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
return
home
and
digest
my
impatience
at
leisure
i
did
not
receive
the
expected
message
from
the
captain
for
nearly
a
week
it
came
at
length
however
and
i
immediately
went
on
board
the
ship
was
crowded
with
passengers
and
everything
was
in
the
bustle
attendant
upon
making
sail
wyatt
party
arrived
in
about
ten
minutes
after
myself
there
were
the
two
sisters
the
bride
and
the
artist
the
latter
in
one
of
his
customary
fits
of
moody
misanthropy
i
was
too
well
used
to
these
however
to
pay
them
any
special
attention
he
did
not
even
introduce
me
to
his
wife
this
courtesy
devolving
per
force
upon
his
sister
marian
a
very
sweet
and
intelligent
girl
who
in
a
few
hurried
words
made
us
acquainted
wyatt
had
been
closely
veiled
and
when
she
raised
her
veil
in
acknowledging
my
bow
i
confess
that
i
was
very
profoundly
astonished
i
should
have
been
much
more
so
however
had
not
long
experience
advised
me
not
to
trust
with
too
implicit
a
reliance
the
enthusiastic
descriptions
of
my
friend
the
artist
when
indulging
in
comments
upon
the
loveliness
of
woman
when
beauty
was
the
theme
i
well
knew
with
what
facility
he
soared
into
the
regions
of
the
purely
ideal
the
truth
is
i
could
not
help
regarding
wyatt
as
a
decidedly
woman
if
not
positively
ugly
she
was
not
i
think
very
far
from
it
she
was
dressed
however
in
exquisite
taste
and
then
i
had
no
doubt
that
she
had
captivated
my
friend
heart
by
the
more
enduring
graces
of
the
intellect
and
soul
she
said
very
few
words
and
passed
at
once
into
her
stateroom
with
my
old
inquisitiveness
now
returned
there
was
servant
was
a
settled
point
i
looked
therefore
for
the
extra
baggage
after
some
delay
a
cart
arrived
at
the
wharf
with
an
oblong
pine
box
which
was
everything
that
seemed
to
be
expected
immediately
upon
its
arrival
we
made
sail
and
in
a
short
time
were
safely
over
the
bar
and
standing
out
to
sea
the
box
in
question
was
as
i
say
oblong
it
was
about
six
feet
in
length
by
two
and
a
half
in
breadth
i
observed
it
attentively
and
like
to
be
precise
now
this
shape
was
and
no
sooner
had
i
seen
it
than
i
took
credit
to
myself
for
the
accuracy
of
my
guessing
i
had
reached
the
conclusion
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
extra
baggage
of
my
friend
the
artist
would
prove
to
be
pictures
or
at
least
a
picture
for
i
knew
he
had
been
for
several
weeks
in
conference
with
nicolino
and
now
here
was
a
box
which
from
its
shape
possibly
contain
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
copy
of
leonardo
last
supper
and
a
copy
of
this
very
last
supper
done
by
rubini
the
younger
at
florence
i
had
known
for
some
time
to
be
in
the
possession
of
nicolino
this
point
therefore
i
considered
as
sufficiently
settled
i
chuckled
excessively
when
i
thought
of
my
acumen
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
known
wyatt
to
keep
from
me
any
of
his
artistical
secrets
but
here
he
evidently
intended
to
steal
a
march
upon
me
and
smuggle
a
fine
picture
to
new
york
under
my
very
nose
expecting
me
to
know
nothing
of
the
matter
i
resolved
to
quiz
him
now
and
hereafter
one
thing
however
annoyed
me
not
a
little
the
box
did
go
into
the
extra
stateroom
it
was
deposited
in
wyatt
own
and
there
too
it
remained
occupying
nearly
the
whole
of
the
floor
no
doubt
to
the
exceeding
discomfort
of
the
artist
and
his
wife
this
the
more
especially
as
the
tar
or
paint
with
which
it
was
lettered
in
sprawling
capitals
emitted
a
strong
disagreeable
and
to
fancy
a
peculiarly
disgusting
odor
on
the
lid
were
painted
the
words
adelaide
curtis
albany
new
york
charge
of
cornelius
wyatt
esq
this
side
up
to
be
handled
with
care
now
i
was
aware
that
adelaide
curtis
of
albany
was
the
wife
mother
but
then
i
looked
upon
the
whole
address
as
a
mystification
intended
especially
for
myself
i
made
up
my
mind
of
course
that
the
box
and
contents
would
never
get
farther
north
than
the
studio
of
my
misanthropic
friend
in
chambers
street
new
york
for
the
first
three
or
four
days
we
had
fine
weather
although
the
wind
was
dead
ahead
having
chopped
round
to
the
northward
immediately
upon
our
losing
sight
of
the
coast
the
passengers
were
consequently
in
high
spirits
and
disposed
to
be
social
i
except
however
wyatt
and
his
sisters
who
behaved
stiffly
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
uncourteously
to
the
rest
of
the
party
conduct
i
did
not
so
much
regard
he
was
gloomy
even
beyond
his
usual
habit
in
fact
he
was
but
in
him
i
was
prepared
for
eccentricity
for
the
sisters
however
i
could
make
no
excuse
they
secluded
themselves
in
their
staterooms
during
the
greater
part
of
the
passage
and
absolutely
refused
although
i
repeatedly
urged
them
to
hold
communication
with
any
person
on
board
wyatt
herself
was
far
more
agreeable
that
is
to
say
she
was
and
to
be
chatty
is
no
slight
recommendation
at
sea
she
became
intimate
with
most
of
the
ladies
and
to
my
profound
astonishment
evinced
no
equivocal
disposition
to
coquet
with
the
men
she
amused
us
all
very
much
i
say
and
scarcely
know
how
to
explain
myself
the
truth
is
i
soon
found
that
was
far
oftener
laughed
than
the
gentlemen
said
little
about
her
but
the
ladies
in
a
little
while
pronounced
her
a
thing
rather
totally
uneducated
and
decidedly
vulgar
the
great
wonder
was
how
wyatt
had
been
entrapped
into
such
a
match
wealth
was
the
general
solution
but
this
i
knew
to
be
no
solution
at
all
for
wyatt
had
told
me
that
she
neither
brought
him
a
dollar
nor
had
any
expectations
from
any
source
whatever
he
had
married
he
said
for
love
and
for
love
only
and
his
bride
was
far
more
than
worthy
of
his
love
when
i
thought
of
these
expressions
on
the
part
of
my
friend
i
confess
that
i
felt
indescribably
puzzled
could
it
be
possible
that
he
was
taking
leave
of
his
senses
what
else
could
i
think
so
refined
so
intellectual
so
fastidious
with
so
exquisite
a
perception
of
the
faulty
and
so
keen
an
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
to
be
sure
the
lady
seemed
especially
fond
of
particularly
so
in
his
absence
when
she
made
herself
ridiculous
by
frequent
quotations
of
what
had
been
said
by
her
beloved
husband
mr
wyatt
the
word
husband
seemed
forever
to
use
one
of
her
own
delicate
expressions
forever
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
in
the
meantime
it
was
observed
by
all
on
board
that
he
avoided
in
the
most
pointed
manner
and
for
the
most
part
shut
himself
up
alone
in
his
where
in
fact
he
might
have
been
said
to
live
altogether
leaving
his
wife
at
full
liberty
to
amuse
herself
as
she
thought
best
in
the
public
society
of
the
main
cabin
my
conclusion
from
what
i
saw
and
heard
was
that
the
artist
by
some
unaccountable
freak
of
fate
or
perhaps
in
some
fit
of
enthusiastic
and
fanciful
passion
had
been
induced
to
unite
himself
with
a
person
altogether
beneath
him
and
that
the
natural
result
entire
and
speedy
disgust
had
ensued
i
pitied
him
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
but
could
not
for
that
reason
quite
forgive
his
incommunicativeness
in
the
matter
of
the
last
supper
for
this
i
resolved
to
have
my
revenge
one
day
he
came
upon
deck
and
taking
his
arm
as
had
been
my
wont
i
sauntered
with
him
backward
and
forward
his
gloom
however
which
i
considered
quite
natural
under
the
circumstances
seemed
entirely
unabated
he
said
little
and
that
moodily
and
with
evident
effort
i
ventured
a
jest
or
two
and
he
made
a
sickening
attempt
at
a
smile
poor
fellow
as
i
thought
of
i
wondered
that
he
could
have
heart
to
put
on
even
the
semblance
of
mirth
at
last
i
ventured
a
i
determined
to
commence
a
series
of
covert
insinuations
or
innuendoes
about
the
oblong
box
just
to
let
him
perceive
gradually
that
i
was
altogether
the
butt
or
victim
of
his
little
bit
of
pleasant
mystification
my
first
observation
was
by
way
of
opening
a
masked
battery
i
said
something
about
the
peculiar
shape
of
box
and
as
i
spoke
the
words
i
smiled
knowingly
winked
and
touched
him
gently
with
my
in
the
ribs
the
manner
in
which
wyatt
received
this
harmless
pleasantry
convinced
me
at
once
that
he
was
mad
at
first
he
stared
at
me
as
if
he
found
it
impossible
to
comprehend
the
witticism
of
my
remark
but
as
its
point
seemed
slowly
to
make
its
way
into
his
brain
his
eyes
in
the
same
proportion
seemed
protruding
from
their
sockets
then
he
grew
very
red
then
hideously
pale
then
as
if
highly
amused
with
what
i
had
insinuated
he
began
a
loud
and
boisterous
laugh
which
to
my
astonishment
he
kept
up
with
gradually
increasing
vigor
for
ten
minutes
or
more
in
conclusion
he
fell
flat
and
heavily
upon
the
deck
when
i
ran
to
uplift
him
to
all
appearance
he
was
i
called
assistance
and
with
much
difficulty
we
brought
him
to
himself
upon
reviving
he
spoke
incoherently
for
some
time
at
length
we
bled
him
and
put
him
to
bed
the
next
morning
he
was
quite
recovered
so
far
as
regarded
his
mere
bodily
health
of
his
mind
i
say
nothing
of
course
i
avoided
him
during
the
rest
of
the
passage
by
advice
of
the
captain
who
seemed
to
coincide
with
me
altogether
in
my
views
of
his
insanity
but
cautioned
me
to
say
nothing
on
this
head
to
any
person
on
board
several
circumstances
occurred
immediately
after
this
fit
of
which
contributed
to
heighten
the
curiosity
with
which
i
was
already
possessed
among
other
things
this
i
had
been
nervous
drank
too
much
strong
green
tea
and
slept
ill
at
night
in
fact
for
two
nights
i
could
not
be
properly
said
to
sleep
at
all
now
my
stateroom
opened
into
the
main
cabin
or
as
did
those
of
all
the
single
men
on
board
wyatt
three
rooms
were
in
the
which
was
separated
from
the
main
one
by
a
slight
sliding
door
never
locked
even
at
night
as
we
were
almost
constantly
on
a
wind
and
the
breeze
was
not
a
little
stiff
the
ship
heeled
to
leeward
very
considerably
and
whenever
her
starboard
side
was
to
leeward
the
sliding
door
between
the
cabins
slid
open
and
so
remained
nobody
taking
the
trouble
to
get
up
and
shut
it
but
my
berth
was
in
such
a
position
that
when
my
own
stateroom
door
was
open
as
well
as
the
sliding
door
in
question
and
my
own
door
was
open
on
account
of
the
heat
i
could
see
into
the
quite
distinctly
and
just
at
that
portion
of
it
too
where
were
situated
the
staterooms
of
wyatt
well
during
two
nights
consecutive
while
i
lay
awake
i
clearly
saw
about
eleven
each
night
steal
cautiously
from
the
stateroom
of
and
enter
the
extra
room
where
she
remained
until
daybreak
when
she
was
called
by
her
husband
and
went
back
that
they
were
virtually
separated
was
clear
they
had
separate
apartments
no
doubt
in
contemplation
of
a
more
permanent
divorce
and
here
after
all
i
thought
was
the
mystery
of
the
extra
stateroom
there
was
another
circumstance
too
which
interested
me
much
during
the
two
wakeful
nights
in
question
and
immediately
after
the
disappearance
of
wyatt
into
the
extra
stateroom
i
was
attracted
by
certain
singular
cautious
subdued
noises
in
that
of
her
husband
after
listening
to
them
for
some
time
with
thoughtful
attention
i
at
length
succeeded
perfectly
in
translating
their
import
they
were
sounds
occasioned
by
the
artist
in
prying
open
the
oblong
box
by
means
of
a
chisel
and
mallet
the
latter
being
muffled
or
deadened
by
some
soft
woollen
or
cotton
substance
in
which
its
head
was
enveloped
in
this
manner
i
fancied
i
could
distinguish
the
precise
moment
when
he
fairly
disengaged
the
lid
also
that
i
could
determine
when
he
removed
it
altogether
and
when
he
deposited
it
upon
the
lower
berth
in
his
room
this
latter
point
i
knew
for
example
by
certain
slight
taps
which
the
lid
made
in
striking
against
the
wooden
edges
of
the
berth
as
he
endeavored
to
lay
it
down
gently
there
being
no
room
for
it
on
the
floor
after
this
there
was
a
dead
stillness
and
i
heard
nothing
more
upon
either
occasion
until
nearly
daybreak
unless
perhaps
i
may
mention
a
low
sobbing
or
murmuring
sound
so
very
much
suppressed
as
to
be
nearly
inaudible
if
indeed
the
whole
of
this
latter
noise
were
not
rather
produced
by
my
own
imagination
i
say
it
seemed
to
sobbing
or
sighing
but
of
course
it
could
not
have
been
either
i
rather
think
it
was
a
ringing
in
my
own
ears
wyatt
no
doubt
according
to
custom
was
merely
giving
the
rein
to
one
of
his
hobbies
indulging
in
one
of
his
fits
of
artistic
enthusiasm
he
had
opened
his
oblong
box
in
order
to
feast
his
eyes
on
the
pictorial
treasure
within
there
was
nothing
in
this
however
to
make
him
i
repeat
therefore
that
it
must
have
been
simply
a
freak
of
my
own
fancy
distempered
by
good
captain
hardy
green
tea
just
before
dawn
on
each
of
the
two
nights
of
which
i
speak
i
distinctly
heard
wyatt
replace
the
lid
upon
the
oblong
box
and
force
the
nails
into
their
old
places
by
means
of
the
muffled
mallet
having
done
this
he
issued
from
his
stateroom
fully
dressed
and
proceeded
to
call
from
hers
we
had
been
at
sea
seven
days
and
were
now
off
cape
hatteras
when
there
came
a
tremendously
heavy
blow
from
the
southwest
we
were
in
a
measure
prepared
for
it
however
as
the
weather
had
been
holding
out
threats
for
some
time
everything
was
made
snug
alow
and
aloft
and
as
the
wind
steadily
freshened
we
lay
to
at
length
under
spanker
and
foretopsail
both
in
this
trim
we
rode
safely
enough
for
hours
the
ship
proving
herself
an
excellent
sea
boat
in
many
respects
and
shipping
no
water
of
any
consequence
at
the
end
of
this
period
however
the
gale
had
freshened
into
a
hurricane
and
our
split
into
ribbons
bringing
us
so
much
in
the
trough
of
the
water
that
we
shipped
several
prodigious
seas
one
immediately
after
the
other
by
this
accident
we
lost
three
men
overboard
with
the
caboose
and
nearly
the
whole
of
the
larboard
bulwarks
scarcely
had
we
recovered
our
senses
before
the
foretopsail
went
into
shreds
when
we
got
up
a
storm
and
with
this
did
pretty
well
for
some
hours
the
ship
heading
the
sea
much
more
steadily
than
before
the
gale
still
held
on
however
and
we
saw
no
signs
of
its
abating
the
rigging
was
found
to
be
and
greatly
strained
and
on
the
third
day
of
the
blow
about
five
in
the
afternoon
our
in
a
heavy
lurch
to
windward
went
by
the
board
for
an
hour
or
more
we
tried
in
vain
to
get
rid
of
it
on
account
of
the
prodigious
rolling
of
the
ship
and
before
we
had
succeeded
the
carpenter
came
aft
and
announced
four
feet
water
in
the
hold
to
add
to
our
dilemma
we
found
the
pumps
choked
and
nearly
useless
all
was
now
confusion
and
despair
but
an
effort
was
made
to
lighten
the
ship
by
throwing
overboard
as
much
of
her
cargo
as
could
be
reached
and
by
cutting
away
the
two
masts
that
remained
this
we
at
last
accomplished
but
we
were
still
unable
to
do
anything
at
the
pumps
and
in
the
meantime
the
leak
gained
on
us
very
fast
at
sundown
the
gale
had
sensibly
diminished
in
and
as
the
sea
went
down
with
it
we
still
entertained
faint
hopes
of
saving
ourselves
in
the
boats
at
eight
the
clouds
broke
away
to
windward
and
we
had
the
advantage
of
a
full
moon
a
piece
of
good
fortune
which
served
wonderfully
to
cheer
our
drooping
spirits
after
incredible
labor
we
succeeded
at
length
in
getting
the
over
the
side
without
material
accident
and
into
this
we
crowded
the
whole
of
the
crew
and
most
of
the
passengers
this
party
made
off
immediately
and
after
undergoing
much
suffering
finally
arrived
in
safety
at
ocracoke
inlet
on
the
third
day
after
the
wreck
fourteen
passengers
with
the
captain
remained
on
board
resolving
to
trust
their
fortunes
to
the
at
the
stern
we
lowered
it
without
difficulty
although
it
was
only
by
a
miracle
that
we
prevented
it
from
swamping
as
it
touched
the
water
it
contained
when
afloat
the
captain
and
his
wife
wyatt
and
party
a
mexican
officer
wife
four
children
and
myself
with
a
negro
valet
we
had
no
room
of
course
for
anything
except
a
few
positively
necessary
instruments
some
provision
and
the
clothes
upon
our
backs
no
one
had
thought
of
even
attempting
to
save
anything
more
what
must
have
been
the
astonishment
of
all
then
when
having
proceeded
a
few
fathoms
from
the
ship
wyatt
stood
up
in
the
and
coolly
demanded
of
captain
hardy
that
the
boat
should
be
put
back
for
the
purpose
of
taking
in
his
oblong
box
sit
down
wyatt
replied
the
captain
somewhat
sternly
you
will
capsize
us
if
you
do
not
sit
quite
still
our
gunwale
is
almost
in
the
water
now
the
box
vociferated
wyatt
still
standing
the
box
i
say
captain
hardy
you
can
not
you
not
refuse
me
its
weight
will
be
but
a
trifle
it
is
nothing
mere
nothing
by
the
mother
who
bore
you
for
the
love
of
heaven
by
your
hope
of
salvation
i
you
to
put
back
for
the
box
the
captain
for
a
moment
seemed
touched
by
the
earnest
appeal
of
the
artist
but
he
regained
his
stern
composure
and
merely
said
wyatt
you
are
i
can
not
listen
to
you
sitdown
i
say
or
you
will
swamp
the
boat
stay
hold
him
seize
him
he
is
about
to
spring
overboard
there
i
knew
it
he
is
over
as
the
captain
said
this
wyatt
in
fact
sprang
from
the
boat
and
as
we
were
yet
in
the
lee
of
the
wreck
succeeded
by
almost
superhuman
exertion
in
getting
hold
of
a
rope
which
hung
from
the
in
another
moment
he
was
on
board
and
rushing
frantically
down
into
the
cabin
in
the
meantime
we
had
been
swept
astern
of
the
ship
and
being
quite
out
of
her
lee
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
tremendous
sea
which
was
still
running
we
made
a
determined
effort
to
put
back
but
our
little
boat
was
like
a
feather
in
the
breath
of
the
tempest
we
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
doom
of
the
unfortunate
artist
was
sealed
as
our
distance
from
the
wreck
rapidly
increased
the
madman
for
as
such
only
could
we
regard
him
was
seen
to
emerge
from
the
up
which
by
dint
of
a
strength
that
appeared
gigantic
he
dragged
bodily
the
oblong
box
while
we
gazed
in
the
extremity
of
astonishment
he
passed
rapidly
several
turns
of
a
rope
first
around
the
box
and
then
around
his
body
in
another
instant
both
body
and
box
ware
in
the
sea
disappearing
suddenly
at
once
and
forever
we
lingered
awhile
sadly
upon
our
oars
with
our
eyes
riveted
upon
the
spot
at
length
we
pulled
away
the
silence
remained
unbroken
for
an
hour
finally
i
hazarded
a
remark
did
you
observe
captain
how
suddenly
they
sank
was
not
that
an
exceedingly
singular
thing
i
confess
that
i
entertained
some
feeble
hope
of
his
final
deliverance
when
i
saw
him
lash
himself
to
the
box
and
commit
himself
to
the
sea
they
sank
as
a
matter
of
course
replied
the
captain
and
that
like
a
shot
they
will
soon
rise
again
however
not
till
the
salt
the
salt
i
ejaculated
hush
said
the
captain
pointing
to
the
wife
and
sisters
of
the
deceased
we
must
talk
of
these
things
at
some
more
appropriate
time
we
suffered
much
and
made
a
narrow
escape
but
fortune
befriended
as
well
as
our
mates
in
the
long
boat
we
landed
in
fine
more
dead
than
alive
after
four
days
of
intense
distress
upon
the
beach
opposite
roanoke
island
we
remained
there
a
week
were
not
by
the
wreckers
and
at
length
obtained
a
passage
to
new
york
about
a
month
after
the
loss
of
the
independence
i
happened
to
meet
captain
hardy
in
broadway
our
conversation
turned
naturally
upon
the
disaster
and
especially
upon
the
sad
fate
of
poor
wyatt
i
thus
learned
the
following
particulars
the
artist
had
engaged
passage
for
himself
wife
two
sisters
and
a
servant
his
wife
was
indeed
as
she
had
been
represented
a
most
lovely
and
most
accomplished
woman
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
of
june
the
day
in
which
i
first
visited
the
ship
the
lady
suddenly
sickened
and
died
the
young
husband
was
frantic
with
grief
but
circumstances
imperatively
forbade
the
deferring
his
voyage
to
new
york
it
was
necessary
to
take
to
her
mother
the
corpse
of
his
adored
wife
and
on
the
other
hand
the
universal
prejudice
which
would
prevent
his
doing
so
openly
was
well
known
of
the
passengers
would
have
abandoned
the
ship
rather
than
take
passage
with
the
dead
body
in
this
dilemma
captain
hardy
arranged
that
the
corpse
being
first
partially
embalmed
and
packed
with
a
large
quantity
of
salt
in
a
box
of
suitable
dimensions
should
be
conveyed
on
board
as
merchandise
nothing
was
to
be
said
of
the
lady
decease
and
as
it
was
well
understood
that
wyatt
had
engaged
passage
for
his
wife
it
became
necessary
that
some
person
should
personate
her
during
the
voyage
this
the
deceased
lady
maid
was
easily
prevailed
on
to
do
the
extra
originally
engaged
for
this
girl
during
her
mistress
life
was
now
merely
retained
in
this
the
slept
of
course
every
night
in
the
daytime
she
performed
to
the
best
of
her
ability
the
part
of
her
mistress
whose
person
it
had
been
carefully
ascertained
was
unknown
to
any
of
the
passengers
on
board
my
own
mistakes
arose
naturally
enough
through
too
careless
too
inquisitive
and
too
impulsive
a
temperament
but
of
late
it
is
a
rare
thing
that
i
sleep
soundly
at
night
there
is
a
countenance
which
haunts
me
turn
as
i
will
there
is
an
hysterical
laugh
which
will
forever
ring
within
my
ears
