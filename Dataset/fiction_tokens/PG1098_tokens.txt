the
turmoil
a
novel
by
booth
tarkington
to
laurel
chapter
i
there
is
a
midland
city
in
the
heart
of
fair
open
country
a
dirty
and
wonderful
city
nesting
dingily
in
the
fog
of
its
own
smoke
the
stranger
must
feel
the
dirt
before
he
feels
the
wonder
for
the
dirt
will
be
upon
him
instantly
it
will
be
upon
him
and
within
him
since
he
must
breathe
it
and
he
may
care
for
no
further
proof
that
wealth
is
here
better
loved
than
cleanliness
but
whether
he
cares
or
not
the
negligently
tended
streets
incessantly
press
home
the
point
and
so
do
the
flecked
and
grimy
citizens
at
a
breeze
he
must
smother
in
the
whirlpools
of
dust
and
if
he
should
decline
at
any
time
to
inhale
the
smoke
he
has
the
meager
alternative
of
suicide
the
smoke
is
like
the
bad
breath
of
a
giant
panting
for
more
and
more
riches
he
gets
them
and
pants
the
fiercer
smelling
and
swelling
prodigiously
he
has
a
voice
a
hoarse
voice
hot
and
rapacious
trained
to
one
tune
i
will
get
wealth
i
will
make
wealth
i
will
sell
wealth
for
more
wealth
my
house
shall
be
dirty
my
garment
shall
be
dirty
and
i
will
foul
my
neighbor
so
that
he
can
not
be
clean
but
i
will
get
wealth
there
shall
be
no
clean
thing
about
me
my
wife
shall
be
dirty
and
my
child
shall
be
dirty
but
i
will
get
wealth
and
yet
it
is
not
wealth
that
he
is
so
greedy
for
what
the
giant
really
wants
is
hasty
riches
to
get
these
he
squanders
wealth
upon
the
four
winds
for
wealth
is
in
the
smoke
not
so
long
ago
as
a
generation
there
was
no
panting
giant
here
no
heaving
grimy
city
there
was
but
a
pleasant
big
town
of
neighborly
people
who
had
understanding
of
one
another
being
on
the
whole
much
of
the
same
type
it
was
a
leisurely
and
kindly
place
it
was
called
and
when
the
visitor
had
been
taken
through
the
state
asylum
for
the
insane
and
made
to
appreciate
the
view
of
the
cemetery
from
a
little
hill
his
host
duty
as
baedeker
was
done
the
good
burghers
were
given
to
jogging
comfortably
about
in
phaetons
or
in
surreys
for
a
family
drive
on
sunday
no
one
was
very
rich
few
were
very
poor
the
air
was
clean
and
there
was
time
to
live
but
there
was
a
spirit
abroad
in
the
land
and
it
was
strong
here
as
elsewhere
a
spirit
that
had
moved
in
the
depths
of
the
american
soil
and
labored
there
sweating
till
it
stirred
the
surface
rove
the
mountains
and
emerged
tangible
and
monstrous
the
god
of
all
good
american
hearts
bigness
and
that
god
wrought
the
panting
giant
in
the
souls
of
the
burghers
there
had
always
been
the
profound
longing
for
size
year
by
year
the
longing
increased
until
it
became
an
accumulated
force
we
must
grow
we
must
be
big
we
must
be
bigger
bigness
means
money
and
the
thing
began
to
happen
their
longing
became
a
mighty
will
we
must
be
bigger
bigger
bigger
get
people
here
coax
them
here
bribe
them
swindle
them
into
coming
if
you
must
but
get
them
shout
them
into
coming
deafen
them
into
coming
any
kind
of
people
all
kinds
of
people
we
must
be
bigger
blow
boost
brag
kill
the
scream
and
bellow
to
the
most
high
bigness
is
patriotism
and
honor
bigness
is
love
and
life
and
happiness
bigness
is
money
we
want
bigness
they
got
it
from
all
the
states
the
people
came
thinly
at
first
and
slowly
but
faster
and
faster
in
thicker
and
thicker
swarms
as
the
quick
years
went
by
white
people
came
and
black
people
and
brown
people
and
yellow
people
the
negroes
came
from
the
south
by
the
thousands
and
thousands
multiplying
by
other
thousands
and
thousands
faster
than
they
could
die
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
the
people
came
the
broken
and
the
unbroken
the
tame
and
the
wild
germans
irish
italians
hungarians
scotch
welsh
english
french
swiss
swedes
norwegians
greeks
poles
russian
jews
dalmatians
armenians
rumanians
servians
persians
syrians
japanese
chinese
turks
and
every
hybrid
that
these
could
propagate
and
if
there
were
no
eskimos
nor
patagonians
what
other
human
strain
that
earth
might
furnish
failed
to
swim
and
bubble
in
this
crucible
with
bigness
came
the
new
machinery
and
the
rush
the
streets
began
to
roar
and
rattle
the
houses
to
tremble
the
pavements
were
worn
under
the
tread
of
hurrying
multitudes
the
old
leisurely
quizzical
look
of
the
faces
was
lost
in
something
harder
and
warier
and
a
cockney
type
began
to
emerge
discernibly
a
cynical
young
mongrel
barbaric
of
feature
muscular
and
cunning
dressed
in
good
fabrics
fashioned
apparently
in
imitation
of
the
sketches
drawn
by
newspaper
comedians
the
female
of
his
kind
came
with
him
a
pale
girl
shoddy
and
a
little
rouged
and
they
communicated
in
a
nasal
argot
mainly
insolences
and
elisions
nay
the
common
speech
of
the
people
showed
change
in
place
of
the
old
midland
vernacular
irregular
but
clean
and
not
unwholesomely
drawling
a
jerky
dialect
of
coined
metaphors
began
to
be
heard
held
together
by
gunnas
and
gottas
and
much
fostered
by
the
public
journals
the
city
piled
itself
high
in
the
center
tower
on
tower
for
a
nucleus
and
spread
itself
out
over
the
plain
mile
after
mile
and
in
its
vitals
like
benevolent
bacilli
contending
with
malevolent
in
the
body
of
a
man
missions
and
refuges
offered
what
resistance
they
might
to
the
saloons
and
all
the
hells
that
cities
house
and
shelter
temptation
and
ruin
were
ready
commodities
on
the
market
for
purchase
by
the
venturesome
highwaymen
walked
the
streets
at
night
and
sometimes
killed
snatching
thieves
were
busy
everywhere
in
the
dusk
while
were
a
common
apprehension
and
frequent
reality
life
itself
was
somewhat
safer
from
intentional
destruction
than
it
was
in
medieval
rome
during
a
faction
war
though
the
roman
murderer
was
more
like
to
pay
for
his
deed
but
death
or
mutilation
beneath
the
wheels
lay
in
ambush
at
every
crossing
the
politicians
let
the
people
make
all
the
laws
they
liked
it
did
not
matter
much
and
the
taxes
went
up
which
is
good
for
politicians
was
a
pastime
of
the
people
nothing
pleased
them
more
singular
fermentation
of
their
humor
they
even
had
laws
forbidding
dangerous
speed
more
marvelous
still
they
had
a
law
forbidding
smoke
they
forbade
chimneys
to
smoke
and
they
forbade
cigarettes
to
smoke
they
made
laws
for
all
things
and
forgot
them
immediately
though
sometimes
they
would
remember
after
a
while
and
hurry
to
make
new
laws
that
the
old
laws
should
be
enforced
and
then
forget
both
new
and
old
wherever
enforcement
threatened
money
or
votes
or
wherever
it
was
too
much
to
bother
it
became
a
joke
influence
was
the
law
so
the
place
grew
and
it
grew
strong
straightway
when
he
came
each
man
fell
to
the
same
worship
give
me
of
thyself
o
bigness
power
to
get
more
power
riches
to
get
more
riches
give
me
of
thy
sweat
that
i
may
sweat
more
give
me
bigness
to
get
more
bigness
to
myself
o
bigness
for
thine
is
the
power
and
the
glory
and
there
is
no
end
but
bigness
ever
and
for
ever
chapter
ii
the
sheridan
building
was
the
biggest
skyscraper
the
sheridan
trust
company
was
the
biggest
of
its
kind
and
sheridan
himself
had
been
the
biggest
builder
and
breaker
and
truster
and
buster
under
the
smoke
he
had
come
from
a
country
at
the
beginning
of
the
growth
and
he
had
gone
up
and
down
in
the
booms
and
relapses
of
that
period
but
each
time
he
went
down
he
rebounded
a
little
higher
until
finally
after
a
year
of
overwork
and
anxiety
the
latter
not
decreased
by
a
chance
remote
but
possible
of
recuperation
from
the
former
in
the
penitentiary
he
found
himself
on
top
with
solid
substance
under
his
feet
and
thereafter
it
but
his
hunger
to
get
was
unabated
for
it
was
in
the
very
bones
of
him
and
grew
fiercer
he
was
the
city
incarnate
he
loved
it
calling
it
god
country
as
he
called
the
smoke
prosperity
breathing
the
dingy
cloud
with
relish
and
when
soot
fell
upon
his
cuff
he
chuckled
he
could
have
kissed
it
good
it
good
he
said
and
smacked
his
lips
in
gusto
clean
soot
it
our
god
bless
it
the
smoke
was
one
of
his
great
enthusiasms
he
laughed
at
a
committee
of
plaintive
housewives
who
called
to
beg
his
aid
against
it
what
brings
your
money
home
on
saturday
night
he
told
them
jovially
may
hurt
your
little
shrubberies
in
the
front
yard
some
but
it
the
catarrhal
climate
and
the
adenoids
that
starts
your
chuldern
coughing
smoke
makes
the
climate
better
smoke
means
good
health
it
makes
the
people
wash
more
they
have
to
wash
so
much
they
wash
off
the
microbes
you
go
home
and
ask
your
husbands
what
smoke
puts
in
their
pockets
out
o
the
and
you
come
around
next
time
to
get
me
to
turn
out
more
smoke
instead
o
chokin
it
off
it
was
narcissism
in
him
to
love
the
city
so
well
he
saw
his
reflection
in
it
and
like
it
he
was
grimy
big
careless
rich
strong
and
unquenchably
optimistic
from
the
deepest
of
his
inside
all
the
way
out
he
believed
it
was
the
finest
city
in
the
world
was
his
word
he
thought
of
it
as
his
city
as
he
thought
of
his
family
as
his
family
and
just
as
profoundly
believed
his
city
to
be
the
finest
city
in
the
world
so
did
he
believe
his
family
to
be
in
spite
of
his
son
bibbs
the
finest
family
in
the
world
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
knew
nothing
worth
knowing
about
either
bibbs
sheridan
was
a
musing
sort
of
boy
poor
in
health
and
considered
the
failure
the
of
the
family
born
during
that
most
dangerous
and
anxious
of
the
early
years
when
the
mother
fretted
and
the
father
took
his
chance
he
was
an
baby
and
grew
meagerly
only
lengthwise
through
a
feeble
childhood
at
his
christening
he
was
committed
for
life
to
mainly
through
lack
of
imagination
on
his
mother
part
for
though
it
was
her
maiden
name
she
had
no
strong
affection
for
it
but
it
was
to
name
the
baby
and
as
she
explained
later
she
think
of
anything
else
she
liked
at
all
she
offered
this
explanation
one
day
when
the
sickly
boy
was
nine
and
after
a
long
fit
of
brooding
had
demanded
some
reason
for
his
name
being
bibbs
he
requested
then
with
unwonted
vehemence
to
be
allowed
to
exchange
names
with
his
older
brother
roscoe
conkling
sheridan
or
with
the
oldest
james
sheridan
junior
and
upon
being
refused
went
down
into
the
cellar
and
remained
there
the
rest
of
that
day
and
the
cook
descending
toward
dusk
reported
that
he
had
vanished
but
a
search
revealed
that
he
was
in
the
completely
covered
and
still
burrowing
removed
by
force
and
carried
upstairs
he
maintained
a
cryptic
demeanor
refusing
to
utter
a
syllable
of
explanation
even
under
the
lash
this
obvious
thing
was
wholly
a
mystery
to
both
parents
the
mother
was
nonplussed
failed
to
trace
and
connect
and
the
father
regarded
his
son
as
a
stubborn
and
mysterious
fool
an
impression
not
effaced
as
the
years
went
by
at
bibbs
was
physically
no
more
than
the
outer
scaffolding
of
a
man
waiting
for
the
building
to
begin
inside
a
rickety
youth
sallow
and
hollow
and
haggard
and
with
a
peculiar
expression
of
countenance
indeed
at
first
sight
of
bibbs
sheridan
a
stranger
might
well
be
solicitous
for
he
seemed
upon
the
point
of
tears
but
to
a
slightly
longer
gaze
not
grief
but
mirth
was
revealed
as
his
emotion
while
a
more
searching
scrutiny
was
proportionately
more
puzzling
he
seemed
about
to
burst
out
crying
or
to
burst
out
laughing
one
or
the
other
inevitably
but
it
was
impossible
to
decide
which
and
bibbs
never
on
any
occasion
of
his
life
either
laughed
aloud
or
wept
he
was
a
to
his
father
at
least
that
was
the
word
a
confirmed
and
established
word
after
his
first
attempt
to
make
a
of
the
boy
he
sent
bibbs
to
at
the
bottom
and
learn
from
the
ground
in
the
of
the
sheridan
automatic
pump
works
and
at
the
end
of
six
months
the
family
physician
sent
bibbs
to
begin
at
the
bottom
and
learn
from
the
ground
up
in
a
sanitarium
need
worry
mamma
sheridan
told
his
wife
nothin
the
matter
with
bibbs
except
he
hates
work
so
much
it
makes
him
sick
i
put
him
in
the
and
i
guess
i
know
what
i
doin
about
as
well
as
the
next
man
ole
doc
gurney
always
was
one
o
them
nutty
alarmists
does
he
think
i
do
anything
be
bad
for
my
own
flesh
and
blood
he
makes
me
tired
anything
except
perfectly
definite
health
or
perfectly
definite
disease
was
incomprehensible
to
sheridan
he
had
a
genuine
conviction
that
lack
of
physical
persistence
in
any
task
involving
money
must
be
due
to
some
subtle
weakness
of
character
itself
to
some
profound
shiftlessness
or
slyness
he
understood
typhoid
fever
pneumonia
and
appendicitis
one
had
them
and
either
died
or
got
over
them
and
went
back
to
work
but
when
the
word
appeared
in
a
diagnosis
he
became
honestly
suspicious
he
had
the
feeling
that
there
was
something
contemptible
about
it
that
there
was
a
nigger
in
the
somewhere
at
me
he
said
at
what
i
did
at
his
age
why
when
i
was
twenty
years
old
was
i
up
every
morning
at
four
wood
yes
and
out
in
the
dark
and
the
snow
to
build
a
fire
in
a
country
grocery
store
and
here
bibbs
has
to
go
and
have
a
doctor
because
he
ca
pho
it
makes
me
tired
if
he
gone
at
it
like
a
man
he
would
be
he
paced
the
bedroom
the
usual
setting
for
such
parental
discussions
in
his
nightgown
shaking
his
big
grizzled
head
and
gesticulating
to
his
bedded
spouse
lord
he
said
a
little
teeny
bit
o
work
like
this
is
too
much
for
him
why
he
ai
fit
for
anything
it
imagination
and
the
rest
of
it
well
i
wo
say
it
deliberate
but
i
would
like
to
know
just
how
much
of
it
put
on
did
want
the
doctor
said
sheridan
was
when
he
was
here
to
dinner
that
night
and
noticed
how
he
could
eat
anything
honey
you
better
come
to
he
snorted
it
work
that
makes
men
eat
and
imagination
that
keeps
people
from
eatin
busy
men
do
get
time
for
that
kind
of
imagination
and
there
another
thing
you
notice
about
good
health
if
you
take
the
trouble
to
look
around
you
sheridan
busy
men
have
got
time
to
be
sick
and
they
do
get
sick
you
just
think
it
over
and
you
find
that
per
cent
of
the
sick
people
you
know
are
either
women
or
loafers
yes
she
said
again
drowsily
better
come
to
at
the
other
boys
her
husband
bade
her
at
jim
and
roscoe
look
at
how
they
work
there
is
a
shiftless
bone
in
their
bodies
work
never
made
jim
or
roscoe
sick
jim
takes
half
the
load
off
my
shoulders
already
right
now
there
is
a
brighter
business
man
in
this
city
than
jim
i
pushed
him
but
he
give
me
something
to
push
against
you
ca
push
dyspepsia
and
look
at
roscoe
just
look
at
what
that
boy
done
for
himself
and
barely
years
old
married
got
a
fine
wife
and
ready
to
build
for
himself
with
his
own
money
when
i
put
up
the
new
house
for
you
and
you
catch
cold
in
your
bare
feet
she
murmured
better
come
to
i
just
as
proud
of
edie
for
a
girl
he
continued
emphatically
i
am
of
jim
and
roscoe
for
boys
she
make
some
man
a
mighty
good
wife
when
the
time
comes
she
the
prettiest
and
talentedest
girl
in
the
united
states
look
at
that
poem
she
wrote
when
she
was
in
school
and
took
the
prize
with
it
the
best
poem
i
ever
read
in
my
life
and
she
never
even
tried
to
write
one
before
it
the
finest
thing
i
ever
read
and
bloss
said
so
too
and
i
guess
he
a
good
enough
literary
judge
for
me
turns
out
more
advertisin
than
any
man
in
the
city
i
tell
you
she
smart
look
at
the
way
she
worked
me
to
get
me
to
promise
the
new
house
and
i
guess
you
had
your
finger
in
that
too
mamma
this
old
shack
good
enough
for
me
but
you
and
little
edie
have
to
have
your
way
i
get
behind
her
and
push
her
the
same
as
i
will
jim
and
roscoe
i
tell
you
i
mighty
proud
o
them
three
chuldern
but
bibbs
he
paused
shaking
his
head
mamma
when
i
talk
to
men
that
got
all
their
boys
doin
well
and
worth
their
salt
why
i
have
to
keep
my
mind
on
jim
and
roscoe
and
forget
about
sheridan
tossed
her
head
fretfully
upon
the
pillow
did
the
best
you
could
papa
she
said
impatiently
come
to
bed
and
quit
reproachin
yourself
for
he
glared
at
her
indignantly
myself
he
snorted
doin
anything
of
the
kind
what
in
the
name
o
goodness
would
i
want
to
reproach
myself
for
and
it
was
the
i
could
either
it
was
the
best
anybody
could
i
was
givin
him
a
chance
to
show
what
was
in
him
and
make
a
man
of
himself
and
here
he
goes
and
gets
dyspepsia
on
me
he
went
to
the
turned
out
the
light
and
muttered
his
way
morosely
into
bed
said
his
wife
crossly
bothered
by
a
subsequent
mumbling
like
i
said
he
explained
speaking
louder
know
what
to
do
with
him
chapter
iii
beginning
at
the
beginning
and
learning
from
the
ground
up
was
a
long
course
for
bibbs
at
the
sanitarium
with
milk
and
as
the
basis
of
instruction
and
the
months
were
many
and
tiresome
before
he
was
considered
near
enough
graduation
to
go
for
a
walk
leaning
on
a
nurse
and
a
cane
these
and
subsequent
months
saw
the
planning
the
building
and
the
completion
of
the
new
house
and
it
was
to
that
abode
of
bigness
that
bibbs
was
brought
when
the
cane
without
the
nurse
was
found
sufficient
to
his
support
edith
met
him
at
the
station
well
bibbs
she
said
as
he
came
slowly
through
the
gates
the
last
of
all
the
travelers
from
that
train
she
gave
his
hand
a
brisk
little
shake
averting
her
eyes
after
a
quick
glance
at
him
and
turning
at
once
toward
the
passage
to
the
street
you
think
they
ought
to
let
you
come
you
certainly
do
look
well
i
certainly
do
look
better
he
returned
in
a
voice
as
slow
as
his
gait
a
drawl
that
was
a
necessity
for
when
bibbs
tried
to
speak
quickly
he
stammered
to
about
a
month
ago
it
took
two
people
to
see
me
they
had
to
get
me
in
a
line
between
edith
did
not
turn
her
eyes
directly
toward
him
again
after
her
first
quick
glance
and
her
expression
in
spite
of
her
showed
a
faint
troubled
distaste
the
look
of
a
healthy
person
pressed
by
some
obligation
of
business
to
visit
a
ward
in
a
hospital
she
was
nineteen
fair
and
slim
with
small
unequal
features
but
a
prettiness
of
color
and
a
brilliancy
of
eyes
that
created
a
total
impression
close
upon
beauty
her
movements
were
eager
and
restless
there
was
something
about
her
as
kind
old
ladies
say
that
was
very
sweet
and
there
was
something
that
was
hurried
and
breathless
this
was
new
to
bibbs
it
was
a
perceptible
change
since
he
had
last
seen
her
and
he
bent
upon
her
a
steady
whimsical
scrutiny
as
they
stood
at
the
curb
waiting
for
an
automobile
across
the
street
to
disengage
itself
from
the
traffic
the
new
car
she
said
new
we
got
four
now
besides
jim
roscoe
got
you
look
he
began
and
paused
we
all
well
she
said
briskly
and
then
as
if
something
in
his
tone
had
caught
her
as
significant
how
do
i
look
bibbs
look
he
paused
again
taking
in
the
full
length
of
her
her
trim
brown
shoes
her
scant
tapering
rough
skirt
and
her
coat
of
brown
and
green
her
long
green
tippet
and
her
mad
little
rough
hat
in
the
mad
mode
all
suited
to
the
october
day
do
i
look
she
insisted
look
he
answered
as
his
examination
ended
upon
an
incrusted
watch
of
platinum
and
enamel
at
her
wrist
look
expensive
that
was
a
substitute
for
what
he
intended
to
say
for
her
constraint
and
preoccupation
manifested
particularly
in
her
keeping
her
direct
glance
away
from
him
did
not
seem
to
grant
the
privilege
of
impulsive
intimacies
expect
i
am
she
laughed
and
sidelong
caught
the
direction
of
his
glance
course
i
ought
to
wear
it
in
the
daytime
it
an
evening
thing
for
the
theater
but
my
day
is
out
of
gear
bobby
lamhorn
broke
it
yesterday
he
a
regular
rowdy
sometimes
do
you
want
claus
to
help
you
in
no
said
bibbs
and
after
a
fit
of
panting
subsequent
to
his
climbing
into
the
car
unaided
he
added
course
i
have
to
tell
people
only
got
your
telegram
this
morning
she
said
as
they
began
to
move
rapidly
through
the
neighboring
the
station
said
she
hardly
expected
you
this
seemed
to
be
through
with
me
up
there
in
the
country
he
explained
gently
least
they
said
they
were
and
they
would
keep
me
any
longer
because
so
many
really
sick
people
wanted
to
get
in
they
told
me
to
go
home
and
i
did
have
any
place
else
to
go
it
be
all
right
edith
i
sit
in
the
woodshed
until
after
dark
every
she
laughed
nervously
course
we
all
of
us
glad
to
have
you
he
said
course
did
he
write
and
tell
you
to
come
home
she
did
not
turn
to
him
with
the
question
all
the
while
she
rode
with
her
face
directly
forward
he
said
has
she
flushed
a
little
expect
i
ought
to
written
sometime
or
one
of
the
boys
no
that
was
all
ca
think
how
busy
we
all
been
this
year
bibbs
i
often
planned
to
write
and
then
just
as
i
was
going
to
something
would
turn
up
and
i
sure
it
been
just
the
same
way
with
jim
and
roscoe
of
course
we
knew
mamma
was
writing
often
and
course
he
said
readily
a
chunk
of
coal
fallen
on
your
glove
edith
better
flick
it
off
before
it
smears
my
word
i
almost
forgotten
how
sooty
it
is
been
having
very
bright
weather
this
month
for
she
blew
the
flake
of
soot
into
the
air
seeming
relieved
he
looked
up
at
the
dingy
sky
wherein
hung
the
disconsolate
sun
like
a
cold
tin
pan
nailed
up
in
a
by
some
lunatic
for
a
decoration
said
bibbs
very
a
few
moments
later
as
they
passed
a
corner
we
going
home
he
asked
yes
did
you
want
to
go
somewhere
else
first
your
new
driver
taking
us
out
of
the
way
is
he
this
is
right
we
going
straight
we
passed
the
corner
we
always
turned
gracious
she
cried
you
know
we
moved
did
you
know
we
were
in
the
new
house
no
said
bibbs
you
been
there
a
month
good
gracious
did
you
know
she
broke
off
flushing
again
and
then
went
on
hastily
course
mamma
never
been
so
busy
in
her
life
we
all
have
had
time
to
do
anything
but
keep
on
the
hop
mamma
could
even
come
to
the
station
got
some
of
his
business
friends
and
people
from
around
the
neighborhood
coming
for
a
big
dinner
and
dreadful
kind
of
people
but
mamma
got
it
all
on
her
hands
she
never
sat
down
a
minute
and
if
she
did
papa
would
have
her
up
again
before
course
said
bibbs
you
like
the
new
place
edith
do
like
some
of
the
things
father
would
have
in
it
but
it
the
finest
house
in
town
and
that
ought
to
be
good
enough
for
me
papa
bought
one
thing
i
like
a
view
of
the
bay
of
naples
in
oil
perfectly
beautiful
it
the
first
thing
you
see
as
you
come
in
the
front
hall
and
it
eleven
feet
long
but
he
would
have
that
old
fruit
picture
we
had
in
the
murphy
street
house
hung
up
in
the
new
you
remember
it
a
table
and
a
watermelon
sliced
open
and
a
lot
of
apples
and
some
shiny
lemons
with
two
dead
on
a
chair
he
bought
it
at
a
years
and
years
ago
and
he
claims
it
a
finer
picture
than
any
they
saw
in
the
museums
that
time
he
took
mamma
to
europe
but
it
horribly
out
of
date
to
have
those
things
in
and
i
caught
bobby
lamhorn
giggling
at
it
and
sibyl
made
fun
of
it
too
with
bobby
and
then
told
papa
she
agreed
with
him
about
its
being
such
a
fine
thing
and
said
he
did
just
right
to
insist
on
having
it
where
he
wanted
it
she
makes
me
tired
sibyl
edith
first
constraint
with
her
brother
amounting
almost
to
awkwardness
vanished
with
this
theme
though
she
still
kept
her
full
gaze
always
to
the
front
even
in
the
extreme
ardor
of
her
denunciation
of
her
she
repeated
with
such
heat
and
vigor
that
the
name
seemed
to
strike
fire
on
her
lips
like
to
know
why
roscoe
could
have
married
somebody
from
here
that
would
have
done
us
some
good
he
could
have
got
in
with
bobby
lamhorn
years
ago
just
as
well
as
now
and
bobby
have
introduced
him
to
the
nicest
girls
in
town
but
instead
of
that
he
had
to
go
and
pick
up
this
sibyl
rink
i
met
some
awfully
nice
people
from
her
town
when
mamma
and
i
were
at
atlantic
city
last
spring
and
not
one
had
ever
heard
of
the
rinks
not
even
heard
of
thought
you
were
great
friends
with
sibyl
bibbs
said
to
the
time
i
found
her
out
the
sister
returned
with
continuing
vehemence
found
out
some
things
about
roscoe
sheridan
lately
only
lately
edith
hesitated
her
lips
setting
primly
course
i
always
did
see
that
she
never
cared
the
snap
of
her
little
finger
about
roscoe
seems
said
bibbs
in
laconic
protest
she
married
the
sister
emitted
a
shrill
cry
to
be
interpreted
as
contemptuous
laughter
and
in
her
emotion
spoke
too
impulsively
she
have
married
you
no
he
said
could
be
that
bad
did
mean
she
began
distressed
only
meant
i
did
mean
mind
edith
he
consoled
her
see
she
could
have
married
me
because
i
did
know
her
and
besides
if
she
as
mercenary
as
all
that
she
have
been
too
clever
the
head
doctor
even
had
to
lend
me
the
money
for
my
ticket
did
mean
anything
unpleasant
about
you
edith
babbled
only
meant
i
thought
she
was
the
kind
of
girl
who
was
so
simply
crazy
to
marry
somebody
she
have
married
anybody
that
asked
yes
said
bibbs
all
and
perceiving
that
his
sister
expression
was
that
of
a
person
whose
adroitness
has
set
matters
perfectly
to
rights
he
chuckled
silently
perfectly
lovely
to
her
she
continued
a
moment
later
lovely
if
he
wake
up
a
little
and
lay
down
the
law
some
day
like
a
man
i
guess
she
respect
him
more
and
learn
to
behave
herself
well
i
mean
she
so
insincere
said
edith
characteristically
evasive
when
it
came
to
stating
the
very
point
to
which
she
had
led
and
in
this
not
unique
of
her
sex
bibbs
contented
himself
with
a
gesture
is
crawling
up
the
old
streets
he
said
his
long
tremulous
hand
indicating
a
vasty
structure
in
course
of
erection
come
first
and
then
the
is
for
shops
she
informed
him
a
new
investment
of
papa
the
apartments
well
he
murmured
supposed
was
almost
well
enough
known
here
we
well
enough
known
about
she
said
impatiently
guess
there
is
a
man
woman
child
or
nigger
baby
in
town
that
know
who
we
are
but
we
are
in
with
the
right
he
exclaimed
all
that
all
what
people
know
what
i
mean
the
best
people
the
old
families
the
people
that
have
the
real
social
position
in
this
town
and
that
know
got
bibbs
indulged
in
his
silent
chuckle
again
he
seemed
greatly
amused
thought
that
the
people
who
actually
had
the
real
did
know
it
he
said
always
understood
that
it
was
very
unsatisfactory
because
if
you
thought
about
it
you
did
have
it
and
if
you
had
it
you
did
know
just
bosh
she
retorted
know
it
in
this
town
all
right
i
found
out
a
lot
of
things
long
before
we
began
to
think
of
building
out
in
this
direction
the
right
people
in
this
town
are
always
the
ones
and
they
mix
around
with
outsiders
and
they
all
belong
to
any
one
club
they
taken
in
all
sorts
into
all
their
clubs
but
they
a
clan
just
the
same
and
they
have
the
clan
feeling
and
they
just
as
much
we
us
and
company
as
any
crowd
you
read
about
anywhere
in
the
world
most
of
were
here
long
before
papa
came
and
the
grandfathers
of
the
girls
of
my
age
knew
each
other
and
see
bibbs
interrupted
gravely
ancestors
fled
together
from
many
a
stricken
field
and
crusaders
blood
flows
in
their
veins
i
always
understood
the
first
house
was
built
by
an
old
party
of
the
name
of
vertrees
who
could
get
along
with
boone
and
hurried
away
to
these
parts
because
wanted
him
to
give
back
a
gun
he
lent
edith
gave
a
little
ejaculation
of
alarm
must
repeat
that
story
bibbs
even
if
it
true
the
vertreeses
are
the
best
family
and
of
course
the
very
oldest
here
they
were
an
old
family
even
before
mary
vertrees
came
west
and
founded
this
settlement
he
came
from
lynn
massachusetts
and
they
have
relatives
there
yet
some
of
the
best
people
in
lynn
exclaimed
bibbs
incredulously
there
are
other
old
families
like
the
vertreeses
she
went
on
not
heeding
him
lamhorns
and
the
kittersbys
and
the
palmerston
smiths
names
to
me
he
interrupted
things
none
of
them
have
my
that
just
it
she
cried
papa
had
never
even
heard
the
name
of
vertrees
vertrees
went
with
some
committee
to
see
him
and
he
told
her
that
smoke
was
what
made
her
husband
bring
home
his
wages
from
the
on
saturday
night
he
told
us
about
it
and
i
thought
i
just
could
live
through
the
night
i
was
so
ashamed
vertrees
has
always
lived
on
his
income
and
papa
did
know
him
of
course
they
the
stiffist
most
elegant
people
in
the
whole
town
and
to
crown
it
all
papa
went
and
bought
the
next
lot
to
the
old
vertrees
country
mansion
it
in
the
very
heart
of
the
best
new
residence
district
now
and
that
where
the
new
house
is
right
next
door
to
them
and
i
must
say
it
makes
their
place
look
rather
shabby
i
met
mary
vertrees
when
i
joined
the
mission
service
helpers
but
she
never
did
any
more
than
just
barely
bow
to
me
and
since
papa
break
i
doubt
if
she
do
that
they
have
you
think
if
i
spread
this
gossip
about
vertrees
the
first
stealing
boone
gun
the
chances
that
they
will
call
knows
what
a
break
he
made
with
vertrees
i
made
him
understand
that
said
edith
demurely
he
promised
to
try
and
meet
vertrees
and
be
nice
to
him
it
just
this
way
if
we
know
them
it
practically
no
use
in
our
having
built
the
new
house
and
if
we
do
know
them
and
they
decent
to
us
we
right
with
the
right
people
they
can
do
the
whole
thing
for
us
bobby
lamhorn
told
sibyl
he
was
going
to
bring
his
mother
to
call
on
her
and
on
mamma
but
it
was
weeks
ago
and
i
notice
he
has
done
it
and
if
vertrees
decides
not
to
know
us
i
darn
sure
mrs
lamhorn
never
come
one
thing
sibyl
did
manage
she
said
bobby
offered
to
bring
his
mother
say
he
is
a
friend
of
roscoe
bibbs
asked
he
a
friend
of
the
whole
family
she
returned
with
a
petulance
which
she
made
an
effort
to
disguise
and
he
got
acquainted
somewhere
and
they
take
him
to
the
theater
about
every
other
night
sibyl
has
him
to
lunch
too
and
keeps
she
broke
off
with
an
angry
little
jerk
of
the
head
can
see
the
new
house
from
the
second
corner
ahead
roscoe
has
built
straight
across
the
street
from
us
you
know
honestly
sibyl
makes
me
think
of
a
snake
sometimes
the
way
she
pulls
the
wool
over
people
eyes
she
honeys
up
to
papa
and
gets
anything
in
the
world
she
wants
out
of
him
and
then
makes
fun
of
him
behind
his
back
yes
and
to
his
face
but
he
ca
see
it
she
got
him
to
give
her
a
porch
for
their
house
after
it
was
heavens
said
bibbs
staring
ahead
as
they
reached
the
corner
and
the
car
swung
to
the
right
following
a
bend
in
the
street
that
the
new
house
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
drawled
pretty
sure
the
sanitarium
about
half
a
size
bigger
i
ca
be
certain
till
i
and
a
moment
later
as
they
entered
the
driveway
he
added
seriously
it
beautiful
chapter
iv
it
was
gray
stone
with
long
roofs
of
thick
green
slate
an
architect
who
loved
the
milder
had
built
what
he
liked
it
was
to
be
seen
at
once
that
he
had
been
left
unhampered
and
he
had
wrought
a
picture
out
of
his
head
into
a
noble
and
exultant
reality
at
the
same
time
a
had
played
so
good
a
second
with
accessories
of
screen
approach
and
vista
that
already
whatever
look
of
newness
remained
upon
the
place
was
to
its
advantage
as
showing
at
least
one
thing
yet
clean
under
the
grimy
sky
for
though
the
smoke
was
thinner
in
this
direction
and
at
this
long
distance
from
the
heart
of
the
town
it
was
not
absent
and
under
tutelage
of
wind
and
weather
could
be
malignant
even
here
where
cows
had
wandered
in
the
meadows
and
corn
had
been
growing
not
ten
years
gone
altogether
the
new
house
was
a
success
it
was
one
of
those
successes
which
leave
the
owners
veiled
in
privacy
it
revealed
nothing
of
the
people
who
lived
in
it
save
that
they
were
rich
there
are
houses
that
can
not
be
detached
from
their
own
people
without
protesting
every
inch
of
mortar
seems
to
mourn
the
separation
and
such
a
house
no
matter
what
be
done
to
it
is
ever
murmurous
with
regret
whispering
the
old
name
sadly
to
itself
unceasingly
but
the
new
house
was
of
a
kind
to
change
hands
without
emotion
in
our
swelling
cities
great
places
of
its
type
are
useful
as
financial
gauges
of
the
business
tides
rich
families
one
after
another
take
title
and
occupy
such
houses
as
fortunes
rise
and
fall
they
mark
the
high
tide
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
a
child
toy
wagon
left
upon
a
walk
or
driveway
of
the
new
house
and
yet
it
was
as
bibbs
rightly
called
it
what
the
architect
thought
of
the
di
napoli
which
hung
in
its
vast
gold
revel
of
rococo
frame
against
the
gray
wood
of
the
hall
is
to
be
conjectured
perhaps
he
had
not
seen
it
did
you
say
only
eleven
feet
bibbs
panted
staring
at
it
as
the
twin
of
a
pullman
porter
helped
him
to
get
out
of
his
overcoat
without
the
frame
she
explained
splendid
do
you
think
it
lightens
things
up
so
the
hall
was
kind
of
gloomy
gloom
now
said
bibbs
statue
in
the
corner
is
pretty
too
she
remarked
and
i
bought
and
bibbs
turned
at
her
direction
to
behold
amid
a
grove
of
tubbed
palms
a
moor
of
a
plastic
composition
painted
with
unappeasable
gloss
and
brilliancy
upon
his
chocolate
head
he
wore
a
gold
turban
in
his
hand
he
held
a
spear
and
for
the
rest
he
was
red
and
yellow
and
black
and
silver
was
the
sole
comment
of
the
returned
wanderer
and
edith
saying
she
would
mamma
left
him
blinking
at
the
moor
presently
after
she
had
disappeared
he
turned
to
the
colored
man
who
stood
waiting
bibbs
in
his
hand
do
you
think
of
it
bibbs
asked
solemnly
replied
the
servitor
mighty
hard
to
dus
dus
git
in
all
wrinkles
yessuh
she
mighty
hard
to
expect
she
must
be
said
bibbs
his
glance
returning
reflectively
to
the
black
bull
beard
for
a
moment
there
a
place
anywhere
i
could
lie
down
we
got
one
nem
spare
rooms
all
fix
up
fo
you
suh
right
up
staihs
suh
nice
he
led
the
way
and
bibbs
followed
slowly
stopping
at
intervals
to
rest
and
noting
a
heavy
increase
in
the
staff
of
service
since
the
exodus
from
the
house
maids
and
scrubwomen
were
at
work
under
the
patently
nominal
direction
of
another
pullman
porter
who
was
profoundly
enjoying
his
own
affectation
of
being
harassed
with
care
got
look
spick
an
span
fo
the
big
doin
guide
explained
chuckling
we
got
big
doin
big
doin
the
room
to
which
he
conducted
his
lagging
charge
was
furnished
in
every
particular
like
a
room
in
a
new
hotel
and
bibbs
found
it
pleasant
though
indeed
any
room
with
a
good
bed
would
have
seemed
pleasant
to
him
after
his
journey
he
stretched
himself
flat
immediately
and
having
replied
to
the
attendant
offer
to
unpack
the
bag
closed
his
eyes
wearily
racially
sympathetic
lowered
the
and
made
an
exit
on
tiptoe
encountering
the
other
the
harassed
overseer
in
the
hall
without
said
the
emerging
one
mighty
shaky
mist

jackson
expressed
the
same
preference
he

tuh

like
somebody
awready
laid
out
he
concluded
and
upon
the
stairway
landing
near
by
two
old
women
on
at
their
work
were
likewise
pessimistic
said
one
lamenting
in
a
whisper

a
turn
to

ye

o

in
heaven
said
the
other
a
o
me
own
come
home
t
die
once
she
fell
silent
at
a
rustling
of
skirts
in
the
corridor
above
them
it
was
sheridan
hurrying
to
greet
her
son
she
was
one
of
those
fat
pink
people
who
fade
and
contract
with
age
like
drying
fruit
and
her
outside
was
a
true
portrait
of
her
her
husband
and
her
daughter
had
long
ago
absorbed
her
what
intelligence
she
had
was
given
almost
wholly
to
comprehending
and
serving
those
two
and
except
in
the
presence
of
one
of
them
she
was
nearly
always
edith
lived
all
day
with
her
mother
as
daughters
do
and
sheridan
so
held
his
wife
to
her
unity
with
him
that
she
had
long
ago
become
unconscious
of
her
existence
as
a
thing
separate
from
his
she
invariably
perceived
his
moods
and
nursed
him
through
them
when
she
did
not
share
them
and
she
gave
him
a
profound
sympathy
with
the
inmost
spirit
and
purpose
of
his
being
even
though
she
did
not
comprehend
it
and
partook
of
it
only
as
a
spectator
they
had
known
but
one
actual
altercation
in
their
lives
and
that
was
thirty
years
past
in
the
early
days
of
sheridan
struggle
when
in
order
to
enhance
the
favorable
impression
he
believed
himself
to
be
making
upon
some
capitalists
he
had
thought
it
necessary
to
accompany
them
to
a
performance
of
black
but
she
had
not
once
referred
to
this
during
the
last
ten
years
sheridan
manner
was
hurried
and
inconsequent
her
clothes
rustled
more
than
other
women
clothes
she
seemed
to
wear
too
many
at
a
time
and
to
be
vaguely
troubled
by
them
and
she
was
patting
a
skirt
down
over
some
unruly
internal
dissension
at
the
moment
she
opened
door
at
sight
of
the
recumbent
figure
she
began
to
close
the
door
softly
withdrawing
but
the
young
man
had
heard
the
turning
of
the
knob
and
the
rustling
of
skirts
and
he
opened
his
eyes
go
mother
he
said
not
he
swung
his
long
legs
over
the
side
of
the
bed
to
rise
but
she
set
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
restraining
him
and
he
lay
flat
again
she
said
bending
over
to
kiss
his
cheek
just
come
for
a
minute
but
i
want
to
see
how
you
seem
edith
said
edith
he
murmured
could
look
at
me
she
sheridan
having
let
in
the
light
at
a
window
came
back
to
the
bedside
look
a
great
deal
better
than
what
you
did
before
you
went
to
the
sanitarium
anyway
it
done
you
good
a
body
can
see
that
right
away
you
need
fatting
up
of
course
and
you
got
much
color
he
said
have
much
you
will
have
when
you
get
your
strength
yes
he
responded
cheerfully
i
look
a
great
deal
better
than
what
i
must
have
a
great
vocabulary
he
chuckled
too
sensitive
said
sheridan
it
makes
her
exaggerate
a
little
what
about
your
diet
all
right
they
told
me
to
eat
at
all
anything
i
good
she
said
nodding
mean
for
you
just
to
build
up
your
strength
that
what
they
told
me
the
last
time
i
went
to
see
you
at
the
sanitarium
you
look
better
than
what
you
did
then
and
only
a
little
time
ago
how
long
was
it
months
i
it
could
be
i
know
it
ai
that
long
but
maybe
it
was
i
thought
and
this
last
month
or
so
i
have
had
scarcely
even
time
to
write
more
than
just
a
line
to
ask
how
you
were
along
but
i
told
edith
to
write
the
weeks
i
could
and
i
asked
jim
to
too
and
they
both
said
they
would
so
i
suppose
you
kept
up
pretty
well
on
the
home
i
think
you
need
said
the
mother
gravely
to
liven
up
a
little
and
take
an
interest
in
things
that
what
papa
was
sayin
this
morning
after
we
got
your
telegram
and
that
what
stimilate
your
appetite
too
he
was
talkin
over
his
plans
for
you
bibbs
turning
on
his
side
shielded
his
eyes
from
the
light
with
his
hand
so
that
he
might
see
her
better
he
paused
plans
is
he
making
for
me
mother
she
turned
away
going
back
to
the
window
to
draw
down
the
shade
you
better
talk
it
over
with
him
she
said
with
perceptible
nervousness
better
tell
you
himself
i
do
feel
as
if
i
had
any
call
exactly
to
go
into
it
and
you
better
get
to
sleep
now
she
came
and
stood
by
the
bedside
once
more
you
must
remember
bibbs
whatever
papa
does
is
for
the
best
he
loves
his
chuldern
and
wants
to
do
what
right
by
all
of
and
you
always
find
right
in
the
he
made
a
little
gesture
of
assent
which
seemed
to
content
her
and
she
rustled
to
the
door
turning
to
speak
again
after
she
had
opened
it
get
a
good
nap
now
so
as
to
be
all
rested
up
for
you
mean
he
bibbs
stammered
having
begun
to
speak
too
quickly
checking
himself
he
drew
a
long
breath
then
asked
quietly
father
expect
me
to
come
this
evening
i
think
he
does
she
answered
see
it
the
as
he
calls
it
and
he
said
he
thinks
all
our
chuldern
ought
to
be
around
us
as
well
as
the
old
friends
and
other
folks
just
what
he
thinks
you
need
to
take
an
interest
and
liven
up
you
do
feel
too
bad
to
come
down
do
you
a
good
look
at
me
he
said
see
here
she
cried
with
brusque
cheerfulness
not
so
bad
off
as
you
think
you
are
bibbs
you
on
the
mend
and
it
wo
do
you
any
harm
to
please
your
is
that
he
interrupted
i
only
afraid
it
might
spoil
somebody
appetite
edith
told
you
the
child
was
too
sensitive
she
interrupted
in
turn
a
plenty
enough
young
man
for
anybody
you
look
like
you
been
through
a
long
spell
and
begun
to
get
well
and
that
all
there
is
to
right
i
come
to
the
party
if
the
rest
of
you
can
stand
it
i
can
do
you
good
she
returned
rustling
into
the
hall
take
a
nap
and
i
send
one
o
the
help
to
wake
you
in
time
for
you
to
get
dressed
up
before
dinner
you
go
to
sleep
right
away
now
bibbs
bibbs
was
unable
to
obey
though
he
kept
his
eyes
closed
something
she
had
said
kept
running
in
his
mind
repeating
itself
over
and
over
interminably
plans
for
you
his
plans
for
you
his
plans
for
you
his
plans
for
you
and
then
taking
the
place
of
plans
for
you
after
what
seemed
a
long
long
while
her
flurried
voice
came
back
to
him
insistently
seeming
to
whisper
in
his
ear
loves
his
chuldern
he
loves
his
chuldern
he
loves
his
find
he
always
right
you
find
he
always
right
until
at
last
as
he
drifted
into
the
state
of
and
distorted
realities
the
voice
seemed
to
murmur
from
beyond
a
great
black
wing
that
came
out
of
the
wall
and
stretched
over
his
bed
it
was
a
black
wing
within
the
room
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
a
black
cloud
crossing
the
sky
bridging
the
whole
earth
from
pole
to
pole
it
was
a
cloud
of
black
smoke
and
out
of
the
heart
of
it
came
a
flurried
voice
whispering
over
and
over
plans
for
you
his
plans
for
you
his
plans
for
you
and
then
there
was
nothing
he
woke
refreshed
stretched
himself
gingerly
as
one
might
have
a
care
against
too
quick
or
too
long
a
pull
upon
a
frayed
elastic
and
getting
to
his
feet
went
blinking
to
the
window
and
touched
the
shade
so
that
it
flew
up
letting
in
a
pale
sunset
he
looked
out
into
the
light
and
smiled
wanly
at
the
next
house
as
edith
grandiose
phrase
came
to
mind
old
vertrees
country
it
stood
in
a
broad
lawn
which
was
separated
from
the
sheridans
by
a
young
hedge
and
it
was
a
big
square
plain
old
box
of
a
house
with
a
giant
atop
for
a
cupola
paint
had
been
spared
for
a
long
time
and
no
one
could
have
put
a
name
to
the
color
of
it
but
in
spite
of
that
the
place
had
no
look
of
being
out
at
heel
and
the
sward
was
as
neatly
trimmed
as
the
sheridans
own
the
separating
hedge
ran
almost
beneath
bibbs
window
for
this
wing
of
the
new
house
extended
here
almost
to
the
edge
of
the
lot
and
directly
opposite
the
window
the
vertreeses
lawn
had
been
graded
so
as
to
make
a
little
knoll
upon
which
stood
a
small
rustic
it
was
almost
on
a
level
with
bibbs
window
and
not
thirty
feet
away
and
it
was
easy
for
him
to
imagine
the
present
dynasty
of
vertreeses
in
grievous
outcry
when
they
had
found
this
retreat
ruined
by
the
juxtaposition
of
the
parvenu
intruder
probably
the
was
pleasant
and
pretty
in
summer
it
had
the
look
of
a
place
wherein
little
girls
had
played
for
a
generation
or
so
with
dolls
and
or
where
a
lovely
old
lady
might
come
to
read
something
dull
on
warm
afternoons
but
now
in
the
thin
light
it
was
desolate
the
color
of
dust
and
hung
with
haggard
vines
which
had
lost
their
leaves
bibbs
looked
at
it
with
grave
sympathy
probably
feeling
some
kinship
with
anything
so
dismantled
then
he
turned
to
a
beside
the
window
and
paid
himself
the
dubious
tribute
of
a
thorough
inspection
he
looked
the
mirror
up
and
down
slowly
repeatedly
but
came
in
the
end
to
a
long
and
earnest
scrutiny
of
the
face
throughout
this
cryptic
seance
his
manner
was
profoundly
impersonal
he
had
the
air
of
an
entomologist
intent
upon
classifying
a
specimen
but
finally
he
appeared
to
become
pessimistic
he
shook
his
head
solemnly
then
gazed
again
and
shook
his
head
again
and
continued
to
shake
it
slowly
in
complete
disapproval
certainly
are
one
horrible
sight
he
said
aloud
and
at
that
he
was
instantly
aware
of
an
observer
turning
quickly
he
was
vouchsafed
the
picture
of
a
charming
lady
framed
in
a
rustic
aperture
of
the
and
staring
full
into
his
window
straight
into
his
eyes
too
for
the
infinitesimal
fraction
of
a
second
before
the
flashingly
censorious
withdrawal
of
her
own
composedly
she
pulled
several
dead
twigs
from
a
vine
the
manner
of
her
action
conveying
a
message
or
proclamation
to
the
effect
that
she
was
in
the
for
the
sole
purpose
of
pruning
and
tending
and
that
no
gentleman
could
suppose
her
presence
there
to
be
due
to
any
other
purpose
whatsoever
or
that
being
there
on
that
account
she
had
allowed
her
attention
to
wander
for
one
instant
in
the
direction
of
things
of
which
she
was
in
reality
unconscious
having
pulled
enough
twigs
to
emphasize
her
unconsciousness
and
at
the
same
time
her
disapproval
of
everything
in
the
nature
of
a
sheridan
or
belonging
to
a
sheridan
she
descended
the
knoll
with
maintained
composure
and
sauntered
toward
a
of
the
country
mansion
of
the
vertreeses
an
elderly
lady
bonneted
and
cloaked
opened
the
door
and
came
to
meet
her
you
ready
mary
i
been
looking
for
you
what
were
you
doing
just
looking
into
one
of
sheridans
windows
said
mary
vertrees
got
caught
at
cried
her
mother
as
we
were
going
to
call
good
heavens
go
just
the
same
the
daughter
returned
suppose
those
women
would
be
glad
to
have
us
if
we
burned
their
house
to
the
who
saw
you
insisted
vertrees
of
the
sons
i
suppose
he
was
i
believe
he
insane
or
something
at
least
i
hear
they
keep
him
in
a
sanitarium
somewhere
and
never
talk
about
him
he
was
staring
at
himself
in
a
mirror
and
talking
to
himself
then
he
looked
out
and
caught
did
he
of
did
he
look
a
ghost
in
a
blue
suit
said
miss
vertrees
moving
toward
the
street
and
waving
a
hand
in
farewell
to
her
father
who
was
observing
them
from
the
window
of
his
library
tragic
and
altogether
impossible
do
come
on
mother
and
let
get
it
over
and
vertrees
with
many
misgivings
set
forth
with
her
daughter
for
their
gracious
assault
upon
the
new
house
next
door
chapter
v
vertrees
having
watched
their
departure
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
something
at
hazard
upon
the
expedition
turned
from
the
window
and
began
to
pace
the
library
thoughtfully
pending
their
return
he
was
about
sixty
a
small
man
withered
and
dry
and
fine
a
trim
little
sketch
of
an
elderly
dandy
his
lambrequin
mustache
relic
of
a
forgotten
anglomania
had
been
profoundly
black
but
now
like
his
smooth
hair
it
was
approaching
an
equally
sheer
whiteness
and
though
his
clothes
were
old
they
had
shapeliness
and
a
flavor
of
mode
and
for
greater
spruceness
there
were
some
jaunty
touches
gray
spats
a
narrow
black
ribbon
across
the
gray
waistcoat
to
the
in
a
pocket
a
fleck
of
color
from
a
button
in
the
lapel
of
the
black
coat
labeling
him
the
descendant
of
patriot
warriors
the
room
was
not
like
him
being
cheerful
and
hideous
whereas
vertrees
was
anxious
and
decorative
under
a
mantel
of
imitation
black
marble
a
merry
little
beamed
forth
upon
high
and
narrow
bookcases
with
long
glass
doors
and
upon
comfortable
incongruous
furniture
and
upon
meaningless
everywhere
and
upon
half
a
dozen
landseer
engravings
which
and
vertrees
sometimes
mentioned
to
each
other
after
thirty
years
of
possession
as
fine
they
had
been
the
first
people
in
town
to
possess
landseer
engravings
and
there
in
art
they
had
rested
but
they
still
had
a
feeling
that
in
all
such
matters
they
were
in
the
van
and
when
vertrees
discovered
landseers
upon
the
walls
of
other
houses
he
thawed
as
a
chieftain
to
a
trusted
follower
and
if
he
found
an
edition
of
bulwer
lytton
accompanying
the
landseers
as
a
final
corroboration
of
culture
he
would
say
inevitably
people
know
good
pictures
and
they
know
good
the
growth
of
the
city
which
might
easily
have
made
him
a
millionaire
had
ruined
him
because
he
had
failed
to
understand
it
when
towns
begin
to
grow
they
have
whims
and
the
whims
of
a
town
always
ruin
somebody
vertrees
had
been
most
strikingly
the
somebody
in
this
case
at
about
the
time
he
bought
the
landseers
he
owned
through
inheritance
an
and
a
large
house
not
far
from
it
where
he
spent
the
winter
and
he
had
a
country
place
a
farm
of
four
hundred
acres
where
he
went
for
the
summers
to
the
comfortable
ugly
old
house
that
was
his
home
now
perforce
all
the
year
round
if
he
had
known
how
to
sit
still
and
let
things
happen
he
would
have
prospered
miraculously
but
strangely
enough
the
dainty
little
man
was
one
of
the
first
to
fall
down
and
worship
bigness
the
which
proceeded
straightway
to
enact
the
role
of
juggernaut
for
his
better
education
he
was
a
true
prophet
of
the
prodigious
growth
but
he
had
a
fatal
gift
for
selling
good
and
buying
bad
he
should
have
stayed
at
home
and
looked
at
his
landseers
and
read
his
bulwer
but
he
took
his
cow
to
market
and
the
trained
milkers
milked
her
dry
and
then
ate
her
he
sold
the
and
the
house
in
town
to
buy
a
great
tract
of
lots
in
a
new
suburb
then
he
sold
the
farm
except
the
house
and
the
ground
about
it
to
pay
the
taxes
on
the
suburban
lots
and
to
them
the
lots
refused
to
stay
up
but
he
had
to
do
something
to
keep
himself
and
his
family
up
so
in
despair
he
sold
the
lots
which
went
up
beautifully
the
next
year
for
that
was
paying
dividends
and
thereafter
he
ceased
to
buy
and
sell
thus
he
disappeared
altogether
from
the
commercial
surface
at
about
the
time
james
sheridan
came
out
securely
on
top
and
sheridan
until
vertrees
called
upon
him
with
her
committee
had
never
heard
the
name
vertrees
pinched
retired
to
his
landseers
and
vertrees
on
the
dividends
though
became
more
and
more
difficult
as
the
years
went
by
and
money
bought
less
and
less
but
there
came
a
day
when
three
servitors
of
bigness
in
philadelphia
took
greedy
counsel
with
four
from
new
york
and
not
long
after
that
there
were
no
more
dividends
for
vertrees
in
fact
there
was
nothing
for
vertrees
because
the
henceforth
was
no
stock
at
all
and
he
had
mortgaged
his
house
long
ago
to
help
according
to
his
conception
of
his
in
one
of
his
own
phrases
six
months
before
the
completion
of
the
new
house
next
door
vertrees
had
sold
his
horses
and
the
worn
victoria
and
to
pay
the
arrears
of
his
two
servants
and
credit
at
the
grocer
and
butcher
and
a
pair
of
elderly
with
such
accoutrements
are
not
very
ample
barter
in
these
days
for
six
months
food
and
fuel
and
service
vertrees
had
discovered
too
that
there
was
no
salary
for
him
in
all
the
buzzing
city
he
could
do
nothing
it
may
be
said
that
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
string
such
times
do
come
in
all
their
bitterness
finally
to
the
man
with
no
trade
or
craft
if
his
feeble
clutch
on
that
slippery
ghost
property
shall
fail
the
windows
grew
black
while
he
paced
the
room
and
smoky
twilight
closed
round
about
the
house
yet
not
more
darkly
than
what
closed
round
about
the
heart
of
the
anxious
little
man
patrolling
the
zone
of
firelight
but
as
the
mantel
clock
struck
wheezily
six
there
was
the
rattle
of
an
outer
door
and
a
rich
and
beautiful
peal
of
laughter
went
ringing
through
the
house
thus
cheerfully
did
mary
vertrees
herald
her
return
with
her
mother
from
their
expedition
among
the
barbarians
she
came
rushing
into
the
library
and
threw
herself
into
a
deep
chair
by
the
hearth
laughing
so
uncontrollably
that
tears
were
in
her
eyes
vertrees
followed
decorously
no
mirth
about
her
on
the
contrary
she
looked
vaguely
disturbed
as
if
she
had
eaten
something
not
quite
certain
to
agree
with
her
and
regretted
it
oh
oh
and
miss
vertrees
was
fain
to
apply
a
handkerchief
upon
her
eyes
so
glad
you
made
us
go
i
would
have
missed
it
vertrees
shook
her
head
suppose
i
very
dull
she
said
gently
did
see
anything
amusing
they
most
ordinary
and
the
house
is
altogether
in
bad
taste
but
we
anticipated
that
and
mary
cried
breaking
in
asked
us
to
dinner
i
going
she
shouted
and
was
seized
with
fresh
paroxysms
of
it
never
in
their
house
before
never
met
any
of
them
but
the
daughter
and
just
barely
met
her
about
you
interrupted
vertrees
turning
sharply
upon
his
wife
she
made
a
little
face
as
if
positive
now
that
what
she
had
eaten
would
not
agree
with
her
could
she
said
that
just
just
the
way
she
she
looked
when
they
asked
her
cried
mary
choking
then
she
she
realized
it
and
tried
to
turn
it
into
a
cough
and
she
did
know
how
and
it
sounded
like
like
a
squeal
suppose
said
vertrees
much
injured
mary
will
have
an
uproarious
time
at
my
funeral
she
makes
fun
of
mary
jumped
up
instantly
and
kissed
her
then
she
went
to
the
mantel
and
leaning
an
elbow
upon
it
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
buckle
of
her
shoe
twinkling
in
the
firelight
did
notice
anything
she
said
far
as
they
were
concerned
mamma
it
was
one
of
the
finest
coughs
you
ever
were
asked
her
father
did
you
see
the
mother
and
daughter
mary
answered
sheridan
is
dumpy
and
rustly
and
miss
sheridan
is
pretty
and
pushing
dresses
by
the
fashion
magazines
and
talks
about
new
york
people
that
have
their
pictures
in
she
tutors
the
mother
but
not
very
successfully
partly
because
her
own
foundation
is
too
flimsy
and
partly
because
she
began
too
late
they
got
an
enormous
moor
of
painted
plaster
or
something
in
the
hall
and
the
girl
evidently
thought
it
was
to
her
credit
that
she
selected
it
have
too
added
vertrees
with
a
glance
of
gentle
pride
at
the
landseers
always
thought
in
a
private
house
the
worst
of
if
one
owned
a
raphael
or
a
titian
said
vertrees
finishing
the
implication
not
in
words
but
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
on
mary
none
of
the
rest
of
them
came
in
you
did
meet
sheridan
or
he
paused
and
adjusted
a
lump
of
coal
in
the
fire
delicately
with
the
poker
one
of
the
sons
mary
glance
crossed
his
at
that
with
a
flash
of
utter
comprehension
he
turned
instantly
away
but
she
had
begun
to
laugh
again
she
said
one
except
the
women
but
mamma
inquired
about
the
sons
thoroughly
vertrees
protested
most
adroitly
too
laughed
the
girl
she
could
help
unconsciously
turning
to
look
at
me
when
she
did
it
vertrees
mind
mamma
sheridan
and
miss
sheridan
neither
of
them
could
help
unconsciously
turning
to
look
at
me
speculatively
at
the
same
time
they
all
three
kept
looking
at
me
and
talking
about
the
oldest
son
james
sheridan
junior
sheridan
said
his
father
is
very
anxious
get
jim
to
marry
and
settle
down
and
she
assured
me
that
is
right
cultivated
another
of
the
sons
the
youngest
one
caught
me
looking
in
the
window
this
afternoon
but
they
did
seem
to
consider
him
quite
one
of
themselves
somehow
though
sheridan
mentioned
that
a
couple
of
years
or
so
ago
he
had
been
sick
and
had
been
to
some
cure
or
other
they
seemed
relieved
to
bring
the
subject
back
to
and
his
virtues
and
to
look
at
me
the
other
brother
is
the
middle
one
roscoe
he
the
one
that
owns
the
new
house
across
the
street
where
that
young
of
the
lamhorns
robert
goes
so
often
i
saw
a
short
dark
young
man
standing
on
the
porch
with
robert
lamhorn
there
the
other
day
so
i
suppose
that
was
roscoe
still
lurks
in
the
mists
but
i
shall
meet
him
papa
she
stepped
nearer
to
him
so
that
he
had
to
face
her
and
his
eyes
were
troubled
as
he
did
there
may
have
been
a
trouble
deep
within
her
own
but
she
kept
their
surface
merry
with
laughter
bibbs
is
the
youngest
one
name
and
bibbs
to
the
best
of
our
information
is
a
lunatic
roscoe
is
married
papa
does
it
have
to
be
jim
vertrees
cried
sharply
outrageous
that
a
perfectly
horrible
way
of
talking
i
close
to
said
mary
turning
to
her
been
able
to
like
anybody
yet
that
asked
me
to
marry
him
and
maybe
i
never
shall
until
a
year
or
so
ago
i
had
everything
i
ever
wanted
in
my
life
you
and
papa
gave
it
all
to
me
and
it
about
time
i
began
to
pay
back
unfortunately
i
do
know
how
to
do
anything
but
something
got
to
be
you
need
talk
of
it
like
that
insisted
the
mother
plaintively
not
it
not
it
not
said
mary
know
that
did
they
happen
to
ask
you
to
dinner
vertrees
inquired
uneasily
thing
hospitality
mary
defined
it
were
so
very
cordial
and
easy
i
think
sheridan
herself
might
have
done
it
just
as
any
kind
old
woman
on
a
farm
might
ask
a
neighbor
but
it
was
miss
sheridan
who
did
it
she
played
around
it
awhile
you
could
see
she
wanted
to
in
a
dreadful
hurry
to
get
into
things
and
i
fancied
she
had
an
idea
it
might
impress
that
lamhorn
boy
to
find
us
there
it
a
sort
of
dinner
and
they
talked
about
it
and
talked
about
it
and
then
the
girl
got
her
courage
up
and
blurted
out
the
invitation
and
mamma
here
mary
was
once
more
a
victim
to
incorrigible
merriment
tried
to
say
yes
and
could
she
swallowed
and
squealed
i
mean
you
coughed
dear
and
then
papa
she
said
that
you
and
she
had
promised
to
go
to
a
lecture
at
the
emerson
club
but
that
her
daughter
would
be
delighted
to
come
to
the
big
show
so
there
i
am
and
there
jim
sheridan
and
there
the
clock
dinner
at
and
she
ran
out
of
the
room
scooping
up
her
fallen
furs
with
a
gesture
of
flying
grace
as
she
sped
when
she
came
down
at
twenty
minutes
after
seven
her
father
stood
in
the
hall
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
waiting
to
be
her
escort
through
the
dark
he
looked
up
and
watched
her
as
she
descended
and
his
gaze
was
fond
and
proud
and
profoundly
disturbed
but
she
smiled
and
nodded
gaily
and
when
she
reached
the
floor
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
least
no
one
could
suspect
me
she
said
look
rich
do
i
papa
she
did
she
had
a
look
that
worshipful
girl
friends
bravely
called
a
head
taller
than
her
father
she
was
as
straight
and
jauntily
poised
as
a
boy
athlete
and
her
brown
hair
and
her
brown
eyes
were
like
her
mother
but
for
the
rest
she
went
back
to
some
stronger
and
livelier
ancestor
than
either
of
her
parents
i
look
too
rich
to
be
suspected
she
insisted
look
everything
beautiful
mary
he
said
huskily
my
dress
she
threw
open
her
dark
velvet
cloak
showing
a
splendor
of
white
and
silver
better
at
nice
next
winter
do
you
think
she
laughed
shrouding
her
glittering
figure
in
the
cloak
again
years
old
and
no
one
would
dream
it
i
did
it
can
do
anything
there
was
a
curious
humility
in
his
tone
and
something
more
a
significance
not
veiled
and
yet
abysmally
apologetic
it
was
as
if
he
suggested
something
to
her
and
begged
her
forgiveness
in
the
same
breath
and
upon
that
for
the
moment
she
became
as
serious
as
he
she
lifted
her
hand
from
his
shoulder
and
then
set
it
back
more
firmly
so
that
he
should
feel
the
reassurance
of
its
pressure
worry
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
gravely
know
exactly
what
you
want
me
to
chapter
vi
it
was
a
brave
and
lustrous
banquet
and
a
noisy
one
too
because
there
was
an
orchestra
among
some
plants
at
one
end
of
the
long
and
after
a
preliminary
stiffness
the
guests
were
impelled
to
converse
necessarily
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
the
whole
company
of
fifty
sat
at
a
great
oblong
table
improvised
for
the
occasion
by
carpenters
but
not
betraying
itself
as
an
improvisation
it
seemed
a
permanent
continent
of
damask
and
lace
with
shores
of
crystal
and
silver
running
up
to
spreading
groves
of
orchids
and
lilies
and
white
roses
an
inhabited
continent
evidently
for
there
were
three
marvelous
gleaming
buildings
one
in
the
center
and
one
at
each
end
white
miracles
wrought
by
some
inspired
craftsman
in
sculptural
icing
they
were
models
in
miniature
and
they
represented
the
sheridan
building
the
sheridan
apartments
and
the
pump
works
nearly
all
the
guests
recognized
them
without
having
to
be
told
what
they
were
and
pronounced
the
likenesses
superb
the
arrangement
of
the
table
was
visibly
baronial
at
the
head
sat
the
great
thane
with
the
flower
of
his
family
and
of
the
guests
about
him
then
on
each
side
came
the
neighbors
of
the
house
grading
down
to
vassals
and
retainers
superintendents
cashiers
heads
of
departments
and
the
like
at
the
foot
where
the
thane
lady
took
her
place
as
a
consolation
for
the
less
important
here
too
among
the
thralls
and
bondmen
sat
bibbs
sheridan
a
meek
banquo
wondering
how
anybody
could
look
at
him
and
eat
nevertheless
there
was
a
vast
continuous
eating
for
these
were
wholesome
folk
who
understood
that
dinner
meant
something
intended
for
introduction
into
the
system
by
means
of
an
aperture
in
the
face
devised
by
nature
for
that
express
purpose
and
besides
nobody
looked
at
bibbs
he
was
better
content
to
be
left
to
himself
his
voice
was
not
strong
enough
to
make
itself
heard
over
the
hubbub
without
an
exhausting
effort
and
the
talk
that
went
on
about
him
was
too
fast
and
too
fragmentary
for
his
drawl
to
keep
pace
with
it
so
he
felt
relieved
when
each
of
his
neighbors
in
turn
after
a
polite
inquiry
about
his
health
turned
to
seek
livelier
responses
in
other
directions
for
the
talk
went
on
with
the
eating
incessantly
it
rose
over
the
throbbing
of
the
orchestra
and
the
clatter
and
clinking
of
silver
and
china
and
glass
and
there
was
a
mighty
babble
sir
started
without
a
flounces
on
the
overskirt
says
your
department
got
to
go
bigger
this
year
i
per
cent
turnover
in
of
the
biggest
men
in
the
biggest
wife
says
she
have
to
let
out
my
pants
if
my
appetite
did
you
see
that
statue
of
a
turk
in
the
hall
one
of
the
finest
things
i
ever
a
dollar
not
a
nickel
not
one
red
cent
do
you
get
out
o
me
i
says
and
so
he
ups
and
the
baby
makes
four
they
lost
they
got
their
raise
and
they
went
in
sir
not
a
dollar
to
his
name
and
look
at
what
wait
the
population
of
this
town
goin
to
hit
the
million
mark
before
she
if
you
can
show
me
a
bigger
deal
than
and
through
the
interstices
of
this
clamoring
bibbs
could
hear
the
continual
booming
of
his
father
heavy
voice
and
once
he
caught
the
sentence
young
lady
that
just
what
did
it
for
me
and
just
what
do
it
for
my
boys
they
got
to
make
two
blades
o
grass
grow
where
one
grew
before
it
was
his
familiar
flourish
an
old
story
to
bibbs
and
now
jovially
declaimed
for
the
edification
of
mary
vertrees
it
was
a
great
night
for
sheridan
the
very
crest
of
his
wave
he
sat
there
knowing
himself
thane
and
master
by
his
own
endeavor
and
his
big
smooth
red
face
grew
more
and
more
radiant
with
good
will
and
with
the
simplest
happiest
most
vanity
he
was
the
picture
of
health
of
good
cheer
and
of
power
on
a
holiday
he
had
thirty
teeth
none
bought
and
showed
most
of
them
when
he
laughed
his
grizzled
hair
was
thick
and
as
unruly
as
a
farm
laborer
his
chest
was
deep
and
big
beneath
its
vast
facade
of
starched
white
linen
where
little
diamonds
twinkled
circling
three
large
pearls
his
hands
were
stubby
and
strong
and
he
used
them
freely
in
gestures
of
marked
picturesqueness
and
though
he
had
grown
fat
at
chin
and
waist
and
wrist
he
had
not
lost
the
look
of
readiness
and
activity
he
dominated
the
table
shouting
jocular
questions
and
railleries
at
every
one
his
idea
was
that
when
people
were
having
a
good
time
they
were
noisy
and
his
own
additions
to
the
hubbub
increased
his
pleasure
and
of
course
met
the
warmest
encouragement
from
his
guests
edith
had
discovered
that
he
had
very
foggy
notions
of
the
difference
between
a
band
and
an
orchestra
and
when
it
was
made
clear
to
him
he
had
held
out
for
a
band
until
edith
threatened
tears
but
the
size
of
the
orchestra
they
hired
consoled
him
and
he
had
now
no
regrets
in
the
matter
he
kept
time
to
the
music
continually
with
his
feet
or
pounding
on
the
table
with
his
fist
and
sometimes
with
spoon
or
knife
upon
his
plate
or
a
glass
without
permitting
these
to
interfere
with
the
real
business
of
eating
and
shouting
to
play
lee
he
would
bellow
down
the
length
of
the
table
to
his
wife
while
the
musicians
were
in
the
midst
of
the
song
perhaps
that
fellow
if
they
do
know
lee
and
when
the
leader
would
shake
his
head
apologetically
in
answer
to
an
obedient
shriek
from
sheridan
the
continuing
vehemently
sheridan
would
roar
fragments
of
lee
naturally
mingling
some
bizet
with
the
air
of
that
uxorious
tribute
there
she
stands
and
waves
her
hands
while
i
away
a
wife
a
star
should
be
yo
ho
oh
oh
oh
nancy
nancy
nancy
lee
oh
lee
there
old
lady
he
would
bellow
to
play
the
gloaming
in
the
gloaming
oh
my
darling
well
if
they
do
know
that
what
the
matter
with
watch
ahoy
good
music
that
the
kind
o
music
i
like
come
on
now
callin
get
singin
down
in
your
part
o
the
table
what
the
matter
you
folks
down
there
anyway
larboard
watch
ahoy
joy
he
feels
as
steals
watch
ahoy
no
external
bubbling
contributed
to
this
effervescence
the
table
had
never
borne
wine
and
more
because
of
timidity
about
it
than
conviction
it
bore
none
now
though
were
copiously
poured
from
bottles
wrapped
for
some
reason
in
napkins
and
proved
wholly
satisfactory
to
almost
all
of
the
guests
and
certainly
no
wine
could
have
inspired
more
turbulent
good
spirits
in
the
host
not
even
bibbs
was
an
alloy
in
this
night
happiness
for
as
sheridan
had
said
he
had
for
plans
which
were
going
to
straighten
out
some
things
that
had
gone
wrong
so
he
pounded
the
table
and
boomed
his
echoes
of
old
songs
and
then
forgetting
these
would
renew
his
friendly
railleries
or
perhaps
turning
to
mary
vertrees
who
sat
near
him
round
the
corner
of
the
table
at
his
right
he
would
become
autobiographical
gentlemen
less
naive
than
he
had
paid
her
that
tribute
for
she
was
a
girl
who
inspired
the
autobiographical
impulse
in
every
man
who
met
her
it
needed
but
the
sight
of
her
the
dinner
seemed
somehow
to
center
about
mary
vertrees
and
the
jocund
host
as
a
play
centers
about
its
hero
and
heroine
they
were
the
rubicund
king
and
the
starry
princess
of
this
spectacle
they
paid
court
to
each
other
and
everybody
paid
court
to
them
down
near
the
sugar
pump
works
where
bibbs
sat
there
was
audible
speculation
and
admiration
who
that
lady
is
makin
such
a
hit
with
the
old
be
some
golly
i
guess
i
could
stand
it
to
marry
rich
then
edith
and
sibyl
were
radiant
at
first
they
had
watched
miss
vertrees
with
an
almost
haggard
anxiety
wondering
what
disasterous
effect
sheridan
pastoral
gaieties
and
other
things
would
have
upon
her
but
she
seemed
delighted
with
everything
and
with
him
most
of
all
she
treated
him
as
if
he
were
some
delicious
foolish
old
joke
that
she
understood
perfectly
laughing
at
him
almost
violently
when
he
bragged
probably
his
first
experience
of
that
kind
in
his
life
it
enchanted
him
as
he
proclaimed
to
the
table
she
had
way
with
she
had
indeed
as
roscoe
sheridan
upon
her
right
discovered
just
after
the
feast
began
since
his
marriage
three
years
before
no
lady
had
bestowed
upon
him
so
protracted
a
full
view
of
brilliant
eyes
and
with
the
look
his
lovely
neighbor
said
and
it
was
her
first
speech
to
him
hope
you
very
susceptible
sheridan
honest
roscoe
was
taken
aback
and
was
all
he
managed
to
say
she
repeated
the
look
deliberately
which
was
noted
with
a
mystification
equal
to
his
own
by
his
sister
across
the
table
no
one
reflected
edith
could
image
mary
vertrees
the
sort
of
girl
who
would
with
married
men
she
was
obviously
the
of
all
edith
defined
her
as
a
a
and
the
look
given
to
roscoe
was
astounding
roscoe
wife
saw
it
too
and
she
was
another
whom
it
puzzled
though
not
because
its
recipient
was
married
said
mary
vertrees
replying
to
roscoe
monosyllable
also
because
we
neighbors
at
table
and
it
dull
times
ahead
for
both
of
us
if
we
do
get
roscoe
was
a
literal
young
man
all
stocks
and
bonds
and
he
had
been
brought
up
to
believe
that
when
a
man
married
he
and
settled
it
was
right
he
felt
for
a
man
as
old
as
his
father
to
pay
florid
compliments
to
as
pretty
a
girl
as
this
miss
vertrees
but
for
himself
young
married
it
would
do
and
it
even
be
quite
moral
he
knew
that
young
married
people
might
have
friendships
like
his
wife
for
lamhorn
but
sibyl
and
lamhorn
never
they
were
always
very
with
each
other
roscoe
would
have
been
troubled
if
sibyl
had
ever
told
lamhorn
she
hoped
he
was
susceptible
we
neighbors
he
said
awkwardly
neighbors
in
houses
too
she
added
not
exactly
i
live
across
the
no
she
exclaimed
and
seemed
startled
mother
told
me
this
afternoon
that
you
lived
at
of
course
i
live
at
home
i
built
that
new
house
across
the
you
she
paused
confused
and
then
slowly
a
deep
color
came
into
her
cheek
i
understood
he
said
wife
and
i
lived
with
the
old
folks
the
first
year
but
that
all
edith
and
jim
live
with
them
of
i
see
she
said
the
deep
color
still
deepening
as
she
turned
from
him
and
saw
written
upon
a
card
before
the
gentleman
at
her
left
the
name
james
sheridan
and
from
that
moment
roscoe
had
little
enough
cause
for
wondering
what
he
ought
to
reply
to
her
disturbing
coquetries
james
sheridan
had
been
anxiously
waiting
for
the
dazzling
visitor
to
through
with
old
roscoe
as
he
thought
of
it
and
give
a
bachelor
a
chance
was
the
younger
but
he
had
always
been
the
steady
of
the
family
jim
was
enough
but
was
considered
livelier
than
roscoe
which
in
truth
is
not
saying
much
for
jim
liveliness
as
their
father
habitually
boasted
both
brothers
were
young
business
men
and
the
principal
difference
between
them
was
merely
that
which
resulted
from
jim
being
still
a
bachelor
physically
they
were
of
the
same
type
dark
of
eyes
and
of
hair
and
and
though
roscoe
was
several
inches
taller
than
jim
neither
was
of
the
height
breadth
or
depth
of
the
father
both
wore
young
business
men
mustaches
and
either
could
have
sat
for
the
lithographs
of
young
business
men
wearing
suitings
in
dark
jim
approving
warmly
of
his
neighbor
profile
perceived
her
access
of
color
which
increased
his
approbation
that
old
roscoe
saying
to
you
miss
vertrees
he
asked
young
married
men
are
mighty
forward
nowadays
but
you
must
let
make
you
i
blushing
she
said
you
sure
and
with
that
she
gave
him
ample
opportunity
to
make
sure
repeating
with
interest
the
look
wasted
upon
roscoe
think
you
must
be
mistaken
she
continued
think
it
your
brother
who
is
blushing
i
thrown
him
into
she
laughed
and
then
leaning
to
him
a
little
said
in
a
tone
as
confidential
as
she
could
make
it
under
cover
of
the
uproar
trying
to
begin
with
him
a
courtship
i
meant
for
you
this
might
well
be
a
style
new
to
jim
and
it
was
he
supposed
it
a
nonsensical
form
of
badinage
and
yet
it
took
his
breath
he
realized
that
he
wished
what
she
said
to
be
the
literal
truth
and
he
was
instantly
snared
by
that
realization
george
he
said
guess
you
the
kind
of
girl
that
can
say
anything
yes
and
get
away
with
it
too
she
laughed
again
in
her
way
so
that
he
could
not
tell
whether
she
was
laughing
at
him
or
at
herself
or
at
the
nonsense
she
was
talking
and
she
said
you
see
i
do
care
whether
i
get
away
with
it
or
not
i
wish
you
tell
me
frankly
if
you
think
i
got
a
chance
to
get
away
with
you
like
if
you
got
a
chance
to
get
away
from
me
jim
was
inspired
to
reply
one
in
the
world
especially
after
beginning
by
making
fun
of
me
like
might
be
so
much
in
fun
as
you
think
she
said
regarding
him
with
sudden
gravity
said
jim
in
simple
honesty
a
funny
girl
her
gravity
continued
an
instant
longer
may
not
turn
out
to
be
funny
for
long
as
you
turn
out
to
be
anything
at
all
for
me
i
expect
i
can
manage
to
be
and
with
that
to
his
own
surprise
it
was
his
turn
to
blush
whereupon
she
laughed
again
he
said
plaintively
not
wholly
lacking
intuition
can
see
you
the
sort
of
girl
that
would
laugh
the
minute
you
see
a
man
really
means
anything
she
cried
gaily
it
might
be
a
matter
of
life
and
death
but
if
you
want
tragedy
i
better
put
the
question
at
once
considering
the
mistake
i
made
with
your
jim
was
dazed
she
seemed
to
be
playing
a
little
game
of
mockery
and
nonsense
with
him
but
he
had
glimpses
of
a
flashing
danger
in
it
he
was
but
too
sensible
of
being
outclassed
and
had
somewhere
a
consciousness
that
he
could
never
quite
know
this
giddy
and
alluring
lady
no
matter
how
long
it
pleased
her
to
play
with
him
but
he
mightily
wanted
her
to
keep
on
playing
with
him
what
question
he
said
breathlessly
you
are
a
new
neighbor
of
mine
and
of
my
family
she
returned
speaking
slowly
and
with
a
severity
think
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
know
at
once
whether
you
are
already
walking
out
with
any
young
lady
or
not
sheridan
think
well
are
you
spoken
for
yet
he
gasped
you
she
cried
and
with
that
they
both
laughed
again
and
the
pastime
proceeded
increasing
both
in
its
gaiety
and
in
its
gravity
observing
its
continuance
robert
lamhorn
opposite
turned
from
a
lively
conversation
with
edith
and
remarked
covertly
to
sibyl
that
miss
vertrees
was
rather
picturesquely
with
and
he
added
languidly
you
suppose
she
would
for
the
moment
sibyl
gave
no
sign
of
having
heard
him
but
seemed
interested
in
the
clasp
of
a
long
of
pearls
a
loop
of
which
she
was
allowing
to
swing
from
her
fingers
resting
her
elbow
upon
the
table
and
following
with
her
eyes
the
twinkle
of
diamonds
and
platinum
in
the
clasp
at
the
end
of
the
loop
she
wore
many
jewels
she
was
pretty
but
hers
was
not
the
kind
of
prettiness
to
be
loaded
with
too
sumptuous
accessories
and
jeweled
are
dangerous
they
may
emphasize
the
wrongness
of
the
wearer
said
miss
vertrees
seems
to
be
starting
pretty
strong
with
jim
repeated
lamhorn
heard
there
was
a
latent
discontent
always
somewhere
in
her
eyes
no
matter
what
she
threw
upon
the
surface
of
cover
it
and
just
now
she
did
not
care
to
cover
it
she
looked
sullen
any
stronger
than
you
did
with
edith
she
inquired
keep
the
peace
he
said
crossly
off
of
have
been
making
her
see
it
this
evening
precisely
said
sibyl
looking
at
him
steadily
talked
to
her
for
heaven
sake
he
begged
the
peace
what
have
you
just
been
doing
he
said
to
your
sheridan
was
booming
and
braying
louder
than
ever
the
orchestra
having
begun
to
play
rosary
to
his
vast
content
count
them
over
he
roared
beating
the
measures
with
his
fork
hour
a
pearl
each
pearl
the
matter
with
all
you
folks
you
sing
miss
vertrees
i
bet
a
thousand
dollars
you
sing
sheridan
she
said
turning
cheerfully
from
the
ardent
jim
do
know
what
you
interrupted
your
son
is
used
to
my
rough
ways
and
my
soldier
wooing
frightens
him
but
i
think
he
was
about
to
say
something
say
something
important
to
him
if
he
does
the
father
threatened
more
delighted
with
her
than
ever
gosh
if
i
was
his
age
or
a
widower
right
now
wait
cried
mary
they
only
make
less
noise
i
want
sheridan
to
say
the
same
he
shouted
tell
me
i
was
mighty
slow
if
i
could
get
ahead
o
jim
why
when
i
was
his
age
must
listen
to
your
father
mary
interrupted
turning
to
jim
who
had
grown
red
again
going
to
tell
us
how
when
he
was
your
age
he
made
those
two
blades
of
grass
grow
out
of
a
teacup
and
you
could
see
for
yourself
he
did
get
them
out
of
his
sleeve
at
that
sheridan
pounded
the
table
till
it
jumped
here
young
lady
he
roared
o
these
days
i
either
goin
to
slap
you
or
i
goin
to
kiss
you
edith
looked
aghast
she
was
afraid
this
was
indeed
awful
but
mary
vertrees
burst
into
ringing
laughter
she
cried
the
one
to
make
me
forget
the
other
which
he
began
and
then
suddenly
gave
forth
such
stentorian
trumpetings
of
mirth
that
for
once
the
whole
table
stopped
to
listen
he
roared
you
do
propose
to
that
girl
i
send
you
back
to
the
with
bibbs
and
bibbs
down
among
the
retainers
by
the
sugar
pump
works
and
watching
mary
vertrees
as
a
ragged
boy
in
the
street
might
watch
a
rich
little
girl
in
a
garden
bibbs
heard
he
heard
and
he
knew
what
his
father
plans
were
now
chapter
vii
vertrees
for
her
daughter
vertrees
having
retired
after
a
restless
evening
not
much
soothed
by
the
society
of
his
landseers
mary
had
taken
a
key
insisting
that
he
should
not
come
for
her
and
seeming
confident
that
she
would
not
lack
for
escort
nor
did
the
sequel
prove
her
confidence
unwarranted
but
vertrees
had
a
long
vigil
of
it
she
was
not
the
woman
to
make
herself
easy
no
servant
had
ever
seen
her
in
a
wrapper
and
with
her
hair
and
dress
and
her
shoes
just
what
they
had
been
when
she
returned
from
the
afternoon
call
she
sat
through
the
slow
night
hours
in
a
stiff
little
chair
under
the
gaslight
in
her
own
room
which
was
directly
over
the
there
book
in
hand
she
employed
the
time
in
her
own
reminiscences
though
it
was
her
belief
that
she
was
reading
madame
de
remusat
her
thoughts
went
backward
into
her
life
and
into
her
husband
and
the
deeper
into
the
past
they
went
the
brighter
the
pictures
they
brought
her
and
there
is
tragedy
like
her
husband
she
thought
backward
because
she
did
not
dare
think
forward
definitely
what
thinking
forward
this
troubled
couple
ventured
took
the
form
of
a
slender
hope
which
neither
of
them
could
have
borne
to
hear
put
in
words
and
yet
they
had
talked
it
over
day
after
day
from
the
very
hour
when
they
heard
sheridan
was
to
build
his
new
house
next
door
for
so
quickly
does
any
ideal
of
human
behavior
become
an
antique
their
youth
was
of
the
innocent
old
days
so
dead
of
and
and
no
craft
had
been
more
straitly
trained
upon
them
than
that
of
talking
about
things
without
mentioning
them
herein
was
marked
the
most
vital
difference
between
and
vertrees
and
their
big
new
neighbor
sheridan
though
his
youth
was
of
the
same
epoch
knew
nothing
of
such
matters
he
had
been
chopping
wood
for
the
morning
fire
in
the
country
grocery
while
they
were
still
dancing
it
was
after
one
when
vertrees
heard
steps
and
the
delicate
clinking
of
the
key
in
the
lock
and
then
with
the
opening
of
the
door
mary
laugh
and
if
you
are
afraid
the
door
closed
and
she
rushed
bringing
with
her
a
breath
of
cold
and
bracing
air
into
her
mother
room
she
said
before
vertrees
could
speak
brought
me
home
she
let
her
cloak
fall
upon
the
bed
and
drawing
an
old
forward
sat
beside
her
mother
after
giving
her
a
light
pat
upon
the
shoulder
and
a
hearty
kiss
upon
the
cheek
mary
exclaimed
when
vertrees
had
expressed
a
hope
that
she
had
enjoyed
the
evening
and
had
not
caught
cold
do
you
ask
me
this
inquiry
obviously
made
her
mother
uncomfortable
do
she
faltered
you
what
mary
i
got
along
and
what
he
it
is
distressing
said
mary
i
got
along
so
fast
she
broke
off
to
laugh
continuing
then
that
the
way
i
went
at
it
of
course
we
are
in
a
hurry
are
we
do
know
what
you
mean
vertrees
insisted
shaking
her
head
plaintively
said
mary
going
out
in
his
car
with
him
afternoon
and
to
the
theater
the
next
night
but
i
stopped
it
there
you
see
after
you
give
the
first
push
you
must
leave
it
to
them
while
you
pretend
to
run
away
dear
i
do
know
what
to
to
make
of
anything
mary
finished
for
her
that
all
right
now
i
tell
you
all
about
it
it
was
gorgeous
and
deafening
and
we
could
have
lived
a
year
on
it
i
not
good
at
figures
but
i
calculated
that
if
we
lived
six
months
on
poor
old
charlie
and
ned
and
the
and
the
victoria
we
could
manage
at
least
twice
as
long
on
the
cost
of
the
i
think
the
orchids
alone
would
have
lasted
us
a
couple
of
months
there
they
were
before
me
but
i
could
steal
and
sell
and
so
well
so
i
did
what
i
could
she
leaned
back
and
laughed
reassuringly
to
her
troubled
mother
seemed
to
be
a
success
what
i
could
she
said
clasping
her
hands
behind
her
neck
and
stirring
the
rocker
to
motion
as
a
rhythmic
accompaniment
to
her
narrative
girl
edith
and
her
roscoe
sheridan
were
too
anxious
about
the
effect
of
things
on
me
the
father
worth
a
bushel
of
both
of
them
if
they
knew
it
what
he
is
i
like
she
paused
reflectively
continuing
in
that
lamhorn
boy
he
and
not
stupid
but
i
think
he
she
interrupted
herself
with
a
cheery
outcry
i
must
be
calling
him
names
if
he
trying
to
make
edith
like
him
i
ought
to
respect
him
as
a
do
understand
a
thing
you
talking
about
vertrees
complained
the
better
well
he
a
bad
lot
that
lamhorn
boy
always
known
that
but
the
sheridans
do
know
the
everybodies
that
know
he
sat
between
edith
and
roscoe
sheridan
she
like
those
people
you
wondered
about
at
the
theater
the
last
time
we
went
dressed
in
bound
to
show
their
clothes
and
jewels
somewhere
she
flatters
the
father
and
so
did
i
for
that
matter
but
not
that
way
i
treated
him
outrageously
what
flattered
him
after
dinner
he
made
the
whole
regiment
of
us
follow
him
all
over
the
house
while
he
lectured
like
a
guide
on
the
palatine
he
gave
dimensions
and
costs
and
the
whole
of
listened
as
if
they
thought
he
intended
to
make
them
a
present
of
the
house
what
he
was
proudest
of
was
the
plumbing
and
that
bay
of
naples
panorama
in
the
hall
he
made
us
look
at
all
the
plumbing
and
everywhere
else
and
then
he
made
us
look
at
the
bay
of
naples
he
said
it
was
a
hundred
and
eleven
feet
long
but
i
think
it
more
and
he
led
us
all
into
the
library
to
see
a
poem
edith
had
taken
a
prize
with
at
school
they
had
it
printed
in
gold
letters
and
framed
in
but
the
poem
itself
was
rather
simple
and
wistful
and
nice
he
read
it
to
us
though
edith
tried
to
stop
him
she
was
modest
about
it
and
said
she
never
written
anything
else
and
then
after
a
while
roscoe
sheridan
asked
me
to
come
across
the
street
to
her
house
with
them
her
husband
and
edith
and
lamhorn
and
jim
sheridan
vertrees
was
shocked
she
exclaimed
please
course
said
mary
make
it
as
easy
for
you
as
i
can
mamma
james
sheridan
junior
we
went
over
there
and
roscoe
explained
that
men
were
all
dying
for
a
drink
though
i
noticed
that
lamhorn
was
the
only
one
near
death
door
on
that
account
edith
and
roscoe
said
they
knew
i
been
bored
at
the
dinner
they
were
objectionably
apologetic
about
it
and
they
seemed
to
think
now
we
were
going
to
have
a
time
to
make
up
for
it
but
i
had
been
bored
at
the
dinner
i
been
amused
and
the
time
at
roscoe
was
horribly
horribly
mary
her
mother
began
is
and
she
seemed
unable
to
complete
the
question
mind
mamma
i
say
it
is
james
sheridan
junior
stupid
i
sure
he
not
at
all
stupid
about
business
otherwise
oh
what
right
have
i
to
be
calling
people
because
they
not
exactly
my
kind
on
the
big
they
had
enormous
icing
models
of
the
sheridan
building
no
vertrees
cried
not
and
two
other
things
of
that
kind
i
do
know
what
but
after
all
i
wondered
if
they
were
so
bad
if
i
been
at
a
dinner
at
a
palace
in
italy
and
a
relief
or
inscription
on
one
of
the
old
silver
pieces
had
referred
to
some
great
deed
or
achievement
of
the
family
i
should
have
felt
superior
i
have
thought
it
picturesque
and
stately
i
have
been
impressed
and
what
the
real
difference
the
icing
is
temporary
and
that
much
more
modest
is
it
and
why
is
it
vulgar
to
feel
important
more
on
account
of
something
you
done
yourself
than
because
of
something
one
of
your
ancestors
did
besides
if
we
go
back
a
few
generations
we
all
got
such
hundreds
of
ancestors
it
seems
idiotic
to
go
picking
out
one
or
two
to
be
proud
of
ourselves
about
well
then
mamma
i
managed
not
to
feel
superior
to
james
sheridan
junior
because
he
did
see
anything
out
of
place
in
the
sheridan
building
in
vertrees
expression
had
lost
none
of
its
anxiety
pending
the
conclusion
of
this
lively
bit
of
analysis
and
she
shook
her
head
gravely
dear
dear
child
she
said
seems
to
me
it
looks
afraid
as
much
of
it
as
you
can
mamma
said
mary
encouragingly
can
get
it
if
you
just
give
me
one
you
say
vertrees
began
timidly
to
have
the
air
of
it
is
as
if
you
were
seeking
to
to
make
yourself
i
see
you
mean
i
sound
as
if
i
were
trying
to
force
myself
to
like
exactly
mary
that
was
quite
what
i
meant
said
vertrees
speaking
direct
untruth
with
perfect
unconsciousness
you
said
that
that
you
found
the
latter
part
of
the
evening
at
young
sheridan
unentertaining
as
james
sheridan
was
there
and
i
saw
more
of
him
than
at
dinner
and
had
a
horribly
stupid
time
in
spite
of
that
you
think
i
and
then
it
was
mary
who
left
the
deduction
unfinished
vertrees
nodded
and
though
both
the
mother
and
the
daughter
understood
mary
felt
it
better
to
make
the
understanding
definite
she
asked
gravely
there
anything
else
i
can
do
you
and
papa
do
want
me
to
do
anything
that
distresses
me
and
so
as
this
is
the
only
thing
to
be
done
it
seems
it
up
to
me
not
to
let
it
distress
me
that
all
there
is
about
it
is
it
nothing
must
distress
you
the
mother
cried
what
i
say
said
mary
cheerfully
so
it
does
it
all
she
rose
and
took
her
cloak
over
her
arm
as
if
to
go
to
her
own
room
but
on
the
way
to
the
door
she
stopped
and
stood
leaning
against
the
foot
of
the
bed
contemplating
a
threadbare
rug
at
her
feet
you
told
me
a
thousand
times
that
it
does
really
matter
whom
a
girl
no
vertrees
protested
never
said
such
a
not
in
words
i
mean
what
you
meant
it
true
is
it
that
marriage
really
is
a
bed
of
roses
but
a
field
of
battle
to
get
right
down
to
it
a
girl
could
fight
it
out
with
anybody
could
she
one
man
as
well
as
another
my
dear
i
sure
your
father
and
i
yes
said
mary
indulgently
do
mean
you
and
papa
but
is
it
propinquity
that
makes
marriages
so
many
people
say
so
there
must
be
something
in
i
ca
bear
for
you
to
talk
like
and
vertrees
lifted
pleading
eyes
to
her
daughter
eyes
that
begged
to
be
spared
sounds
almost
reckless
mary
caught
the
appeal
came
to
her
and
kissed
her
gaily
fret
dear
i
not
likely
to
do
anything
i
do
want
to
do
i
always
been
too
a
little
pig
and
if
it
is
propinquity
that
does
our
choosing
for
us
well
at
least
no
girl
in
the
world
could
ask
for
more
than
that
how
could
there
be
any
more
propinquity
than
the
very
house
next
door
she
gave
her
mother
a
final
kiss
and
went
gaily
all
the
way
to
the
door
this
time
pausing
for
her
postscript
with
her
hand
on
the
knob
the
one
that
caught
me
looking
in
the
window
mamma
the
youngest
one
he
speak
of
it
vertrees
asked
apprehensively
he
did
speak
at
all
that
i
saw
to
any
one
i
did
meet
him
but
he
is
insane
i
sure
or
if
he
is
he
has
long
intervals
when
he
not
james
sheridan
mentioned
that
he
lived
at
home
when
he
was
enough
and
it
may
be
he
only
an
invalid
he
looks
dreadfully
ill
but
he
has
pleasant
eyes
and
it
struck
me
that
if
if
one
were
in
the
sheridan
she
laughed
a
little
ruefully
might
be
interesting
to
talk
to
sometimes
when
there
was
too
much
stocks
and
bonds
i
did
see
him
after
must
be
something
wrong
with
him
said
vertrees
have
introduced
him
if
there
do
know
he
been
ill
so
much
and
away
so
much
sometimes
people
like
that
just
do
seem
to
in
a
family
his
father
spoke
of
sending
him
back
to
a
of
some
sort
i
suppose
he
meant
when
the
poor
thing
gets
better
i
glanced
at
him
just
then
when
sheridan
mentioned
him
and
he
happened
to
be
looking
straight
at
me
and
he
was
enough
before
that
but
the
most
tragic
change
came
over
him
he
seemed
just
to
die
right
there
at
the
table
mean
when
his
father
spoke
of
sending
him
to
the
shop
place
sheridan
must
be
very
said
mary
thoughtfully
do
think
he
is
but
he
might
be
uncomprehending
and
certainly
he
the
kind
of
man
to
do
anything
he
once
sets
out
to
do
but
i
wish
i
had
been
looking
at
that
poor
boy
just
then
i
afraid
i
keep
remembering
vertrees
smiled
faintly
and
in
her
smile
there
was
the
remotest
ghost
of
a
genteel
roguishness
keep
my
mind
on
pleasanter
things
mary
laughed
and
nodded
indeed
plenty
pleasant
enough
and
probably
if
all
were
known
too
good
even
for
me
and
when
she
had
gone
vertrees
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
a
burden
were
off
her
mind
and
smiling
began
to
undress
in
a
gentle
reverie
chapter
viii
edith
glancing
casually
into
the
library
stopped
abruptly
seeing
bibbs
there
alone
he
was
standing
before
the
and
poem
musingly
inspecting
it
he
read
it
fugitive
i
will
forget
the
things
that
sting
the
lashing
look
the
barbed
word
i
know
the
very
hands
that
fling
the
stones
at
me
had
never
stirred
to
anger
but
for
their
own
scars
they
suffered
so
that
why
they
strike
i
keep
my
heart
among
the
stars
where
none
shall
hunt
it
out
oh
like
these
wounded
ones
i
must
not
be
for
wounded
i
might
strike
in
turn
so
none
shall
hurt
me
far
and
free
where
my
heart
flies
no
one
shall
learn
edith
voice
was
angry
and
her
color
deepened
suddenly
as
she
came
into
the
room
preceded
by
a
scent
of
violets
much
more
powerful
than
that
warranted
by
the
actual
bunch
of
them
upon
the
lapel
of
her
coat
bibbs
did
not
turn
his
head
but
wagged
it
solemnly
seeming
depressed
by
the
poem
young
is
it
he
said
must
have
been
something
about
your
looks
that
got
the
prize
edith
i
ca
believe
the
poem
did
she
glanced
hurriedly
over
her
shoulder
and
spoke
sharply
but
in
a
low
voice
do
think
it
very
nice
of
you
to
bring
it
up
at
all
bibbs
i
like
a
chance
to
forget
the
whole
silly
business
i
want
them
to
frame
it
and
i
wish
to
goodness
papa
quit
talking
about
it
but
here
that
night
after
the
dinner
did
he
go
and
read
it
aloud
to
the
whole
crowd
of
and
then
they
all
wanted
to
know
what
other
poems
i
written
and
why
i
did
keep
it
up
and
write
some
more
and
if
i
did
why
did
i
and
why
this
and
why
that
till
i
thought
i
die
of
shame
could
tell
you
had
writer
cramp
bibbs
suggested
could
tell
anything
i
just
choke
with
mortification
every
time
anybody
speaks
of
the
bibbs
looked
grieved
poem
is
that
bad
edith
you
see
you
were
only
seventeen
when
you
wrote
hush
up
she
snapped
wish
it
had
burnt
my
fingers
the
first
time
i
touched
it
then
i
might
have
had
sense
enough
to
leave
it
where
it
was
i
had
no
business
to
take
it
and
i
been
ashamed
no
he
said
comfortingly
was
the
very
most
flattering
thing
ever
happened
to
me
it
was
almost
my
last
flight
before
i
went
to
the
and
it
pleasant
to
think
somebody
liked
it
enough
to
i
do
like
it
she
exclaimed
do
even
understand
it
and
papa
made
so
much
fuss
over
its
getting
the
prize
i
just
hate
it
the
truth
is
i
never
dreamed
it
get
the
they
expected
father
to
endow
the
school
bibbs
murmured
i
had
to
have
something
to
turn
in
and
i
could
write
a
line
i
hate
poetry
anyhow
and
bobby
lamhorn
always
teasing
me
about
how
i
my
heart
among
the
stars
he
makes
it
seem
such
a
mushy
kind
of
thing
the
way
he
says
it
i
hate
it
have
to
live
it
down
edith
perhaps
abroad
and
under
another
name
you
might
find
hush
up
i
hire
some
one
to
steal
it
and
burn
it
the
first
chance
i
she
turned
away
petulantly
moving
to
the
door
like
to
think
i
could
hope
to
hear
the
last
of
it
before
i
die
he
called
as
she
went
into
the
hall
the
matter
want
to
ask
you
do
i
really
look
better
or
have
you
just
got
used
to
me
on
earth
do
you
mean
she
said
coming
back
as
far
as
the
threshold
i
first
came
you
could
look
at
me
bibbs
explained
in
his
impersonal
way
i
noticed
you
look
at
me
lately
i
wondered
if
i
because
you
look
so
much
better
she
told
him
cheerfully
month
you
been
here
done
you
no
end
of
good
it
the
that
what
they
said
at
the
sanitarium
the
look
worse
than
anybody
i
ever
saw
said
edith
with
supreme
candor
i
do
know
much
about
it
i
never
seen
a
corpse
in
my
life
and
i
never
even
seen
anybody
that
was
terribly
sick
so
you
must
judge
by
me
i
only
know
you
do
look
better
i
glad
to
say
but
you
right
about
my
not
being
able
to
look
at
you
at
first
you
had
a
kind
of
whiteness
that
well
you
almost
as
thin
i
suppose
but
you
got
more
just
ordinarily
pale
not
that
ghastly
look
anybody
could
look
at
you
now
bibbs
and
no
not
get
almost
that
she
laughed
you
getting
a
better
color
every
day
bibbs
you
really
are
you
getting
along
i
afraid
so
he
said
ruefully
so
well
if
you
are
the
queerest
i
suppose
you
mean
father
might
send
you
back
to
the
if
you
get
well
enough
i
heard
him
say
something
about
it
the
night
of
the
the
jingle
of
a
distant
bell
interrupted
her
and
she
glanced
at
her
watch
lamhorn
i
going
to
motor
him
out
to
look
at
a
place
in
the
country
afternoon
bibbs
when
she
had
gone
bibbs
mooned
pessimistically
from
shelf
to
shelf
his
eye
wandering
among
the
titles
of
the
books
the
library
consisted
almost
entirely
of
handsome
irving
poe
cooper
goldsmith
scott
byron
burns
longfellow
tennyson
hume
gibbon
prescott
thackeray
dickens
de
musset
balzac
gautier
flaubert
goethe
schiller
dante
and
tasso
there
were
shelves
and
shelves
of
encyclopedias
of
anthologies
of
classics
of
masterpieces
of
of
oratory
and
more
shelves
of
of
of
drama
and
of
they
made
an
effective
decoration
for
the
room
all
these
big
expensive
books
with
a
glossy
binding
here
and
there
twinkling
a
reflection
of
the
flames
that
crackled
in
the
splendid
gothic
fireplace
but
bibbs
had
an
impression
that
the
bookseller
who
selected
them
considered
them
a
relief
and
that
considered
them
a
burden
of
dust
and
that
nobody
else
considered
them
at
all
himself
he
disturbed
not
one
there
came
a
chime
of
bells
from
a
clock
in
another
part
of
the
house
and
appeared
beamingly
in
the
doorway
bearing
furs
mist
bibbs
he
announced

up

f

an
she
cain

an
not

at

he
equipped
bibbs
for
the
daily
drive
gurney
had
commanded
and
in
the
manner
of
a
master
of
ceremonies
unctuously
led
the
way
in
the
hall
they
passed
the
moor
and
bibbs
paused
before
it
while
opened
the
door
with
a
flourish
and
waved
condescendingly
to
the
chauffeur
in
the
car
which
stood
waiting
in
the
driveway
seems
to
me
i
asked
you
what
you
thought
about
this
when
i
first
came
home
george
said
bibbs
thoughtfully
did
you
tell
me
george
chuckled
perfectly
understanding
that
for
some
unknown
reason
bibbs
enjoyed
hearing
him
repeat
his
opinion
of

moor
ast
me
when

and

moment
later

to

this
singular
prophecy
founded
somewhat
recklessly
upon
gratitude
for
the
meaning
of
differed
radically
from
another
prediction
concerning
bibbs
set
forth
for
the
benefit
of
a
fair
auditor
some
twenty
minutes
later
jim
sheridan
skirting
the
edges
of
the
town
with
mary
vertrees
beside
him
in
his
own
swift
machine
encountered
the
invalid
upon
the
highroad
the
two
cars
were
going
in
opposite
directions
and
the
occupants
of
jim
had
only
a
swaying
glimpse
of
bibbs
sitting
alone
on
the
back
seat
his
white
face
startlingly
white
against
cap
and
collar
of
black
fur
but
he
flashed
into
recognition
as
mary
bowed
to
him
jim
waved
his
left
hand
carelessly
bibbs
taking
his
constitutional
he
explained
i
know
said
mary
bowed
to
him
too
though
i
never
met
him
in
fact
i
only
seen
him
once
no
twice
i
hope
he
wo
think
i
very
bold
bowing
to
doubt
if
he
noticed
it
said
honest
jim
no
she
cried
the
trouble
almost
sure
people
notice
it
when
i
bow
to
i
see
said
jim
course
they
would
ordinarily
but
bibbs
is
he
how
she
asked
strikes
me
as
anything
but
i
his
brother
jim
said
deprecatingly
i
do
know
what
he
like
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
never
felt
exactly
like
i
was
his
brother
the
way
i
do
roscoe
bibbs
never
did
seem
more
than
half
alive
to
me
of
course
roscoe
and
i
are
older
and
when
we
were
boys
we
were
too
big
to
play
with
him
but
he
never
played
anyway
with
boys
his
own
age
he
rather
just
sit
in
the
house
and
mope
around
by
himself
nobody
could
ever
get
him
to
do
anything
you
ca
get
him
to
do
anything
now
he
never
had
any
life
in
him
and
honestly
if
he
is
my
brother
i
must
say
i
believe
bibbs
sheridan
is
the
laziest
man
god
ever
made
father
put
him
in
the
over
at
the
pump
works
best
thing
in
the
world
for
him
and
he
was
just
plain
no
account
it
made
him
sick
if
he
had
the
right
kind
of
energy
the
kind
father
got
for
instance
or
roscoe
either
why
it
would
have
made
him
sick
and
suppose
it
was
either
of
them
yes
or
me
either
do
you
think
any
of
us
would
have
stopped
if
we
were
sick
not
much
i
hate
to
say
it
but
bibbs
sheridan
never
amount
to
anything
as
long
as
he
mary
looked
thoughtful
there
any
particular
reason
why
he
should
she
asked
gracious
he
exclaimed
do
mean
that
do
you
do
you
believe
in
a
man
knowing
how
to
earn
his
salt
no
matter
how
much
money
his
father
got
has
the
business
of
this
world
got
to
be
carried
on
by
everybody
in
it
are
we
going
to
lay
back
on
what
got
and
see
other
fellows
get
ahead
of
us
if
we
got
big
things
already
is
it
every
man
business
to
go
ahead
and
make
bigger
is
it
his
duty
do
we
always
want
to
get
bigger
and
bigger
i
do
know
but
i
feel
rather
sorry
for
your
brother
he
looked
so
lonely
and
gettin
better
every
day
jim
said
gurney
says
so
nothing
much
the
matter
with
him
really
it
imaginary
people
that
are
willing
to
be
busy
do
have
nervous
diseases
because
they
do
have
time
to
imagine
mean
his
trouble
is
really
mental
he
not
a
lunatic
said
jim
just
queer
sometimes
say
something
right
bright
but
half
the
time
what
he
says
is
off
the
subject
or
else
there
is
any
sense
to
it
at
all
for
instance
the
other
day
i
heard
him
talkin
to
one
of
the
darkies
in
the
hall
the
darky
asked
him
what
time
he
wanted
the
car
for
his
drive
and
anybody
else
in
the
world
would
have
just
said
what
time
they
did
want
it
and
that
would
have
been
all
there
was
to
it
but
here
what
bibbs
says
and
i
heard
him
with
my
own
ears
time
do
i
want
the
car
he
says
now
that
depends
that
depends
he
says
he
talks
slow
like
that
you
know
tell
you
what
time
i
want
the
car
george
he
says
you
tell
me
what
you
think
of
this
statue
exactly
his
words
asked
the
darky
what
he
thought
of
that
arab
edith
and
mother
bought
for
the
hall
mary
pondered
upon
this
might
have
been
in
fun
perhaps
she
suggested
a
darky
what
he
thought
of
a
piece
of
statuary
of
a
work
of
art
where
on
earth
would
be
the
fun
of
that
no
you
just
and
that
the
way
you
ought
to
be
of
course
you
sheridan
she
laughed
here
he
cried
there
any
way
for
us
to
get
over
this
mister
and
miss
thing
a
month
got
days
in
it
i
managed
to
be
with
you
a
part
of
pretty
near
all
the
and
i
think
you
know
how
i
feel
by
this
time
she
looked
immediately
no
she
protested
quickly
i
do
and
you
do
he
said
and
his
voice
shook
a
little
could
help
i
do
she
denied
hurriedly
do
help
knowing
i
mean
oh
wait
for
you
do
know
how
i
feel
and
you
well
you
certainly
wanted
me
to
feel
that
way
or
else
pretended
now
she
lamented
spoiling
such
a
cheerful
afternoon
it
he
slowed
down
the
car
and
turned
his
face
to
her
squarely
here
miss
vertrees
have
you
stop
the
car
a
and
when
he
had
complied
she
faced
him
as
squarely
as
he
evidently
desired
her
to
face
him
i
do
want
you
to
go
on
not
he
asked
sharply
do
mean
it
just
a
whim
do
know
she
repeated
her
voice
was
low
and
troubled
and
honest
and
she
kept
her
clear
eyes
upon
his
you
tell
me
something
you
ever
told
any
man
you
loved
him
and
at
that
though
she
laughed
she
looked
a
little
contemptuous
she
said
i
do
think
i
ever
shall
tell
any
man
that
or
ever
know
what
it
means
i
in
earnest
you
you
just
been
flirting
with
me
poor
jim
looked
both
furious
and
crestfallen
one
bit
she
cried
one
word
not
one
syllable
i
meant
every
single
thing
do
course
you
do
she
said
sheridan
i
want
you
to
start
the
car
now
thank
you
slowly
till
i
finish
what
i
have
to
say
i
have
not
flirted
with
you
i
have
deliberately
courted
you
one
thing
more
and
then
i
want
you
to
take
me
straight
home
talking
about
the
weather
all
the
way
i
said
that
i
do
not
believe
i
shall
ever
for
any
man
and
that
is
true
i
doubt
the
existence
of
the
kind
of
we
hear
about
in
poems
and
plays
and
novels
i
think
it
must
be
just
a
kind
of
emotional
talk
most
of
it
at
all
events
i
do
feel
it
now
we
can

final
look

she
inclined
her
head
in
a
broken
sort
of
acquiescence
very

unfathomably

chapter
ix
through
the
open
country
bibbs
was
borne
flying
between
brown
fields
and
groves
of
gray
trees
to
breathe
the
rushing
clean
air
beneath
a
glorious
sky
that
sky
so
despised
in
the
city
and
so
maltreated
there
that
from
early
october
to
it
was
impossible
for
men
to
remember
that
blue
is
the
rightful
color
overhead
upon
each
of
bibbs
cheeks
there
was
a
hint
of
something
almost
resembling
a
pinkishness
not
actual
color
but
undeniably
its
phantom
how
largely
this
apparition
may
have
been
the
work
of
the
wind
upon
his
face
it
is
difficult
to
calculate
for
beyond
a
doubt
it
was
partly
the
result
of
a
lady
bowing
to
him
upon
no
more
formal
introduction
than
the
circumstance
of
his
having
caught
her
looking
into
his
window
a
month
before
she
had
bowed
definitely
she
had
bowed
charmingly
and
it
seemed
to
bibbs
that
she
must
have
meant
to
convey
her
forgiveness
there
had
been
something
in
her
recognition
of
him
unfamiliar
to
his
experience
and
he
rode
the
warmer
for
it
nor
did
he
lack
the
impression
that
he
would
long
remember
her
as
he
had
just
seen
her
her
veil
tumultuously
blowing
back
her
face
glowing
in
the
wind
and
that
look
of
gay
friendliness
tossed
to
him
like
a
fresh
rose
in
carnival
by
and
by
upon
a
rising
ground
the
driver
halted
the
car
then
backed
and
tacked
and
sent
it
forward
again
with
its
nose
to
the
south
and
the
smoke
far
before
him
bibbs
saw
the
great
smudge
upon
the
horizon
that
nest
of
cloud
in
which
the
city
strove
and
panted
like
an
engine
shrouded
in
its
own
steam
but
to
bibbs
who
had
now
to
go
to
the
very
heart
of
it
for
a
commanded
interview
with
his
father
the
distant
cloud
was
like
an
implacable
genius
issuing
thunderously
in
smoke
from
his
enchanted
bottle
and
irresistibly
drawing
bibbs
nearer
and
nearer
they
passed
from
the
farm
lands
and
came
in
the
amber
light
of
november
late
afternoon
to
the
farthermost
outskirts
of
the
city
and
here
the
sky
shimmered
upon
the
verge
of
change
from
blue
to
gray
the
smoke
did
not
visibly
permeate
the
air
but
it
was
there
nevertheless
impalpable
thin
no
more
than
the
dust
of
smoke
and
then
as
the
car
drove
on
the
chimneys
and
stacks
of
factories
came
swimming
up
into
view
like
miles
of
steamers
advancing
abreast
every
funnel
with
its
vast
plume
savage
and
black
sweeping
to
the
horizon
dripping
wealth
and
dirt
and
suffocation
over
league
on
league
already
rich
and
vile
with
grime
the
sky
had
become
only
a
dingy
thickening
of
the
soiled
air
and
a
roar
and
clangor
of
metals
beat
deafeningly
on
bibbs
ears
and
now
the
car
passed
two
great
blocks
of
long
brick
buildings
hideous
in
all
ways
possible
to
make
them
hideous
doorways
showing
dark
one
moment
and
lurid
the
next
with
the
leap
of
some
virulent
interior
flame
revealing
blackened
giants
half
naked
in
passionate
action
struggling
with
formless
things
in
the
hot
illumination
and
big
as
these
shops
were
they
were
growing
bigger
spreading
over
a
third
block
where
two
new
structures
were
mushrooming
to
completion
in
some
hasty
cement
process
of
a
stability
not
bibbs
pulled
the
rug
closer
about
him
and
not
even
the
phantom
of
color
was
left
upon
his
cheeks
as
he
passed
this
place
for
he
knew
it
too
well
across
the
face
of
one
of
the
buildings
there
was
an
enormous
sign
automatic
pump
thence
they
went
through
streets
of
wooden
houses
all
grimed
and
adding
their
own
grime
from
many
a
sooty
chimney
flimsey
wooden
houses
of
a
thousand
flimsy
whimsies
in
the
fashioning
built
on
narrow
lots
and
nudging
one
another
crossly
shutting
out
the
stingy
sunlight
from
one
another
bad
neighbors
who
would
destroy
one
another
root
and
branch
some
night
when
the
right
wind
blew
they
were
only
waiting
for
that
wind
and
a
cigarette
and
then
they
would
all
be
gone
together
a
pinch
of
incense
burned
upon
the
tripod
of
the
god
along
these
streets
there
were
skinny
and
here
and
there
a
forest
elm
or
walnut
had
been
left
but
these
were
dying
some
people
said
it
was
the
scale
some
said
it
was
the
smoke
and
some
were
sure
that
asphalt
and
the
streets
did
it
but
bigness
was
in
too
big
a
hurry
to
bother
much
about
trees
he
had
and
and
and
by
the
thousand
to
take
their
places
so
he
let
the
trees
die
and
put
up
his
poles
they
were
hideous
but
nobody
minded
that
and
sometimes
the
wires
fell
and
killed
people
but
not
often
enough
to
matter
at
all
thence
onward
the
car
bore
bibbs
through
the
older
parts
of
the
town
where
the
few
solid
old
houses
not
already
demolished
were
in
transition
some
with
their
fronts
torn
away
were
being
made
into
segments
of
others
had
gone
uproariously
into
trade
brazenly
putting
forth
on
their
first
floors
seeming
to
mean
it
for
a
joke
one
or
two
with
unaltered
facades
peeped
humorously
over
the
tops
of
temporary
office
buildings
of
one
story
erected
in
the
old
front
yards
altogether
the
town
here
was
like
a
hash
the
sunday
after
thanksgiving
the
old
ingredients
were
discernible
this
was
the
fringe
of
bigness
own
sanctuary
and
now
bibbs
reached
the
roaring
holy
of
holies
itself
the
car
must
stop
at
every
crossing
while
the
crowds
enveloped
in
maelstroms
of
dust
hurried
before
it
magnificent
new
buildings
already
dingy
loomed
hundreds
of
feet
above
him
newer
ones
more
magnificent
were
rising
beside
them
rising
higher
old
buildings
were
coming
down
buildings
were
coming
down
the
streets
were
laid
open
to
their
entrails
and
men
worked
underground
between
palisades
and
overhead
in
metal
cobwebs
like
spiders
in
the
sky
and
long
interurban
cars
built
to
split
the
wind
like
clanged
and
shrieked
their
way
round
swarming
corners
of
every
kind
and
shape
known
to
man
babbled
frightful
warnings
and
frantic
demands
hospital
ambulances
clamored
wildly
for
passage
signaled
the
swinging
of
titanic
tentacle
and
claw
riveters
rattled
like
the
ground
shook
to
the
thunder
of
gigantic
trucks
and
the
conglomerate
sound
of
it
all
was
the
sound
of
earthquake
playing
accompaniments
for
battle
and
sudden
death
on
one
of
the
new
steel
buildings
no
work
was
being
done
that
afternoon
the
building
had
killed
a
man
in
the
morning
and
the
always
stop
for
the
day
when
that
and
in
the
hurrying
crowds
swirling
and
sifting
through
the
brobdingnagian
camp
of
iron
and
steel
one
saw
the
and
the
pagan
women
there
would
be
work
and
dancing
for
the
puritan
dry
voice
is
but
the
crackling
of
a
leaf
underfoot
in
the
rush
and
roar
of
the
coming
of
the
new
egypt
bibbs
was
on
time
he
knew
it
must
be
the
or
his
father
would
consider
it
an
outrage
and
the
big
chronometer
in
office
marked
four
precisely
when
bibbs
walked
in
coincidentally
with
his
entrance
five
people
who
had
been
at
work
in
the
office
under
sheridan
direction
walked
out
they
departed
upon
no
visible
or
audible
suggestion
and
with
a
promptness
that
seemed
ominous
to
the
as
the
massive
door
clicked
softly
behind
the
elderly
stenographer
the
last
of
the
procession
bibbs
had
a
feeling
that
they
all
understood
that
he
was
a
failure
as
a
great
man
son
a
disappointment
the
of
the
family
and
that
he
had
been
summoned
to
judgment
a
impression
for
that
was
exactly
what
they
understood
down
said
sheridan
it
is
frequently
an
advantage
for
deans
and
worried
fathers
to
place
delinquents
in
the
bibbs
sat
sheridan
standing
gazed
enigmatically
upon
his
son
for
a
period
of
silence
then
walked
slowly
to
a
window
and
stood
looking
out
of
it
his
big
hands
loosely
hooked
together
by
the
thumbs
behind
his
back
they
were
soiled
as
were
all
other
hands
except
such
as
might
be
still
damp
from
a
basin
bibbs
he
said
at
last
not
altering
his
attitude
you
know
what
i
goin
to
do
with
you
bibbs
leaning
back
in
his
chair
fixed
his
eyes
contemplatively
upon
the
ceiling
heard
you
tell
jim
he
began
in
his
slow
way
said
you
send
him
to
the
with
me
if
he
did
propose
to
miss
vertrees
so
i
suppose
that
must
be
your
plan
for
me
but
what
said
sheridan
irritably
as
the
son
paused
there
somebody
you
let
me
propose
to
that
brought
his
father
sharply
round
to
face
him
beat
the
devil
bibbs
what
is
the
matter
with
you
why
ca
you
be
like
anybody
else
maybe
said
bibbs
gently
even
ole
doc
gurney
says
there
nothin
wrong
with
you
organically
no
you
a
dreamer
bibbs
that
what
the
matter
and
that
all
the
matter
oh
not
one
o
these
big
dreamers
that
put
through
the
big
deals
no
sir
you
the
kind
o
dreamer
that
just
sets
out
on
the
back
fence
and
thinks
about
how
much
trouble
there
must
be
in
the
world
that
ai
the
kind
that
builds
the
bridges
bibbs
it
the
kind
that
borrows
fifteen
cents
from
his
wife
to
get
ten
cent
worth
o
plug
tobacco
and
a
worth
o
quinine
he
put
the
finishing
touch
on
this
etching
with
a
snort
and
turned
again
to
the
window
out
there
he
bade
his
son
out
o
that
window
look
at
the
life
and
energy
down
there
i
should
think
any
young
man
blood
would
tingle
to
get
into
it
and
be
part
of
it
look
at
the
big
things
young
men
are
doin
in
this
town
he
swung
about
coming
to
the
mahogany
desk
in
the
middle
of
the
room
at
what
i
was
doin
at
your
age
look

minute

to
keep
on

bigger
he
slapped
the
desk
resoundingly
with
his
open
palm
and
then
observing
that
bibbs
remained
in
the
same
impassive
attitude
with
his
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
ceiling
in
a
contemplation
somewhat
plaintive
sheridan
was
impelled
to
groan
lord
he
said
is
the
way
you
always
were
i
do
believe
you
understood
a
darn
word
i
been
sayin
you
do
look
as
if
you
did
by
george
it
discouraging
do
understand
about
getting
about
getting
bigger
said
bibbs
bringing
his
gaze
down
to
look
at
his
father
placatively
do
see
just
why
sheridan
leaned
forward
resting
his
hands
upon
the
desk
and
staring
across
it
incredulously
at
his
son
do
understand
exactly
what
you
want
it
all
bigger
for
god
shouted
sheridan
and
struck
the
desk
a
blow
with
his
clenched
fist
son
of
mine
asks
me
that
you
go
out
and
ask
the
poorest
you
can
find
ask
him
that
question
did
once
bibbs
interrupted
i
was
in
the
i
he
say
said
hell
answered
bibbs
mildly
i
reckon
he
would
sheridan
swung
away
from
the
desk
reckon
he
certainly
would
and
i
got
plenty
sympathy
with
him
right
now
myself
the
same
answer
then
bibbs
voice
was
serious
almost
tremulous
sheridan
roared
you
ever
hear
the
word
prosperity
you
ninny
did
you
ever
hear
the
word
ambition
did
you
ever
hear
the
word
progress
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
after
the
outburst
his
big
chest
surging
his
throat
tumultuous
with
gutteral
incoherences
then
he
said
huskily
when
the
anguish
had
somewhat
abated
do
you
want
to
do
do
you
want
to
do
i
taken
by
surprise
bibbs
stammered
what
do
i
what
i
let
you
do
exactly
what
you
had
the
whim
for
what
would
you
do
bibbs
looked
startled
then
timidity
overwhelmed
him
a
profound
shyness
he
bent
his
head
and
fixed
his
lowered
eyes
upon
the
toe
of
his
shoe
which
he
moved
to
and
fro
upon
the
rug
like
a
culprit
called
to
the
desk
in
school
would
you
do
loaf
bibbs
voice
was
almost
inaudible
and
what
little
sound
it
made
was
unquestionably
a
guilty
sound
suppose
i
i
suppose
i
try
to
to
what
important
just
poems
and
essays
all
see
said
his
father
breathing
quickly
with
the
restraint
he
was
putting
upon
himself
is
you
want
to
write
but
you
do
want
to
write
anything
of
any
think
sheridan
got
up
again
take
my
hat
off
to
the
man
that
can
write
a
good
ad
he
said
emphatically
best

this
country

back
of
it

tell
you

to
make

up
their
money

the
actual
skill
o
puttin
words

to
make
things
happen
bloss
right

this
city

a
minute

in
his
whole
life

bibbs
said
indistinctly
the
last
word
smothered
in
a
cough
course
i
right
and
if

like
you

want
to
take
up
with
the
most
kind
o
writin
there
is
and
essays
my
lord
bibbs
that
women
work
you
ca
pick
up
a
newspaper
without
havin
to
see
where
rumskididle
read
a
paper
on
eyre
or
lynne
at
the
club
and
why
look
at
edith
i
expect
that
poem
o
hers
would
set
a
pretty
mark
for
you
young
man
and
it
the
only
one
she
ever
managed
to
write
in
her
whole
life
when
i
wanted
her
to
go
on
and
write
some
more
she
said
it
took
too
much
time
said
it
took
months
and
months
and
edith
a
smart
girl
she
got
more
energy
in
her
little
finger
than
you
ever
give
me
a
chance
to
see
in
your
whole
body
bibbs
now
look
at
the
facts
say
she
could
turn
out
four
or
five
poems
a
year
and
you
could
turn
out
maybe
two
that
medal
she
got
was
worth
about
fifteen
dollars
so

income
thirty
dollars
a
year

a
fine
success
to
make
of
your
life

not
sayin
a
word
against

would
take
ten
thousand
dollars
right
now
for
that
poem
of
edith
and
poetry
all
right
enough
in
its
place
but
you
leave
it
to
the
girls
a
man
got
to
do
a
man
work
in
this
world

seated
himself
in
a
chair
at
his
son

and
leaning
over

confidentially
on
the
knee

statuary
and
she

she

he
had
become
intensely
grave
he
spoke
with
solemnity
bibbs
i
ca
take
any
of
it
nor
any
gold
or
silver
nor
buildings
nor
bonds
away
with
me
in
my
shroud
when
i
have
to
go
but
i
want
to
leave
my
share
in
it
to
my
boys
i
worked
for
it
i
been
a
builder
and
a
maker
and
two
blades
of
grass
have
grown
where
one
grew
before
whenever
i
laid
my
hand
on
the
ground
and
willed
to
grow
i
built
big
and
i
want
the
buildin
to
go
on
and
when
my
last
hour
comes
i
want
to
know
that
my
boys
are
ready
to
take
charge
that
they
fit
to
take
charge
and
go
on
with
it
bibbs
when
that
hour
comes
i
want
to
know
that
my
boys
are
big
men
ready
and
fit
to
take
hold
of
big
things
bibbs
when
i
up
above
i
want
to
know
that
the
big
share
i
made
mine
here
below
is
growin
bigger
and
bigger
in
the
charge
of
my
he
leaned
back
deeply
moved
he
said
huskily
never
spoken
more
what
was
in
my
heart
in
my
life
i
do
it
because
i
want
you
to
understand
and
not
think
me
a
mean
father
i
never
had
to
talk
that
way
to
jim
and
roscoe
they
understood
without
any
talk
see
said
bibbs
least
i
think
i
do
but
a
minute
sheridan
raised
his
hand
you
see
the
least
bit
in
the
world
then
you
understand
how
it
feels
to
me
to
have
my
son
set
here
and
talk
about
and
essays
and
fooleries
and
you
must
understand
too
what
it
meant
to
start
one
o
my
boys
and
have
him
come
back
on
me
the
way
you
did
and
have
to
be
sent
to
a
sanitarium
because
he
could
stand
work
now
let
get
right
down
to
it
bibbs
i
had
a
whole
lot
o
talk
with
ole
doc
gurney
about
you
one
time
another
and
i
reckon
i
understand
your
case
just
about
as
well
as
he
does
anyway
now
here
i
be
frank
with
you
i
started
you
in
harder
than
what
i
did
the
other
boys
and
that
was
for
your
own
good
because
i
saw
you
needed
to
be
shook
up
more
they
did
you
were
always
kind
of
moody
and
mopish
and
you
needed
work
that
keep
you
on
the
jump
now
why
did
it
make
you
sick
instead
of
brace
you
up
and
make
a
man
of
you
the
way
it
ought
of
done
i
pinned
ole
gurney
down
to
it
i
says
here
ai
it
really
because
he
just
plain
hated
it
he
says
it
if
he
enjoyed
it
it
would
hurt
him
he
loathes
it
and
that
affects
his
nervous
system
the
more
he
tries
it
the
more
he
hates
it
and
the
more
he
hates
it
the
more
injury
it
does
him
that
ai
quite
his
words
but
it
what
he
meant
and
that
about
the
way
it
said
bibbs
about
the
way
it
then
i
reckon
it
up
to
me
not
only
to
make
you
do
it
but
to
make
you
like
it
bibbs
shivered
and
he
turned
upon
his
father
a
look
that
was
almost
ghostly
ca
he
said
in
a
low
voice
go
back
to
the
shop
ca
like
it
i
sheridan
jumped
up
his
patience
gone
to
his
own
view
he
had
reasoned
exhaustively
had
explained
fully
and
had
pleaded
more
than
a
father
should
only
to
be
met
in
the
end
with
the
unreasoning
and
mysterious
stubbornness
which
had
been
bibbs
baffling
characteristic
from
childhood
george
you
will
he
cried
go
back
there
and
you
like
it
gurney
says
it
wo
hurt
you
if
you
like
it
and
he
says
it
kill
you
if
you
go
back
and
hate
it
so
it
looks
as
if
it
was
about
up
to
you
not
to
hate
it
well
gurney
a
fool
hatin
work
does
kill
anybody
and
this
is
goin
to
kill
you
whether
you
hate
it
or
not
i
never
made
a
mistake
in
a
serious
matter
in
my
life
and
it
was
a
mistake
my
sendin
you
there
in
the
first
place
and
i
goin
to
prove
it
i
goin
to
send
you
back
there
and
vindicate
my
judgment
gurney
says
it
all
attitude
well
you
to
learn
the
right
one
he
says
in
a
couple
more
months
this
fool
thing
that
been
the
matter
with
you
be
disappeared
completely
and
be
back
in
as
good
or
better
condition
than
you
were
before
you
ever
went
into
the
shop
and
right
then
is
when
you
begin
over
right
in
that
same
shop
nobody
can
call
me
a
hard
man
or
a
mean
father

do
the
best
i

for
my
chuldern
and
i
take
full
responsibility
for
bringin
my

begin
with
my
own

i
goin
to
make
a
man
of

god
i
am
bibbs
rose
and
went
slowly
to
the
door
where
he
turned
say
you
give
me
a
couple
of
months
he
said
sheridan
pushed
a
on
his
desk
said
two
months
more
would
put
you
back
where
you
were
you
go
home
and
begin
to
get
yourself
in
the
right
attitude
before
those
two
months
are
up
sir
said
bibbs
meekly
chapter
x
bibbs
room
that
neat
apartment
for
transients
to
which
the
george
had
shown
him
upon
his
return
still
bore
the
appearance
of
temporary
quarters
possibly
because
bibbs
had
no
clear
conception
of
himself
as
a
permanent
incumbent
however
he
had
set
upon
the
mantelpiece
the
two
photographs
that
he
owned
one
a
twenty
years
old
his
father
and
mother
with
jim
and
roscoe
as
boys
and
the
other
a
of
edith
at
sixteen
and
upon
a
table
were
the
books
he
had
taken
from
his
trunk
sartor
resartus
virginibus
puerisque
huckleberry
finn
and
afterwhiles
there
were
some
other
books
in
the
trunk
a
large
one
which
remained
unremoved
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
adding
to
the
general
impression
of
transiency
it
contained
nearly
all
the
possessions
as
well
as
the
secret
life
of
bibbs
sheridan
and
bibbs
sat
beside
it
the
day
after
his
interview
with
his
father
raking
over
a
small
collection
of
manuscripts
in
the
top
tray
some
of
these
he
glanced
through
dubiously
finding
little
comfort
in
them
but
one
made
him
smile
then
he
shook
his
head
ruefully
indeed
and
ruefully
began
to
read
it
it
was
written
on
paper
stamped
sanitarium
and
bore
the
title
a
man
may
keep
a
quiet
heart
at
seventy
miles
an
hour
but
not
if
he
is
running
the
train
nor
is
the
habit
of
contemplation
a
useful
quality
in
the
stoker
of
a
foundry
furnace
it
will
not
be
found
to
recommend
him
to
the
approbation
of
his
superiors
for
a
profession
adapted
solely
to
the
pursuit
of
happiness
in
thinking
i
would
choose
that
of
an
invalid
his
money
is
time
and
he
may
spend
it
on
olympus
it
will
not
suffice
to
be
an
amateur
invalid
to
my
way
of
thinking
the
perfect
practitioner
must
be
to
all
outward
purposes
already
dead
if
he
is
to
begin
the
perfect
enjoyment
of
life
his
serenity
must
not
be
disturbed
by
rumors
of
recovery
he
must
lie
serene
in
his
long
chair
in
the
sunshine
the
world
must
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
and
the
wall
must
be
so
thick
and
so
high
that
he
can
not
hear
the
roaring
of
the
furnace
fires
and
the
screaming
of
the
whistles
peace
having
read
so
far
as
the
word
bibbs
suffered
an
interruption
interesting
as
a
coincidence
of
contrast
high
voices
sounded
in
the
hall
just
outside
his
door
and
it
became
evident
that
a
woman
quarrel
was
in
progress
the
parties
to
it
having
begun
it
in
edith
room
and
continuing
it
vehemently
as
they
came
out
into
the
hall
you
better
go
home
bibbs
heard
his
sister
vociferating
shrilly
better
go
home
and
keep
your
mind
a
little
more
on
your
husband
edie
he
heard
his
mother
remonstrating
as
peacemaker
see
here
this
was
sibyl
and
her
voice
was
both
acrid
and
tremulous
you
talk
to
me
that
way
i
came
here
to
tell
mother
sheridan
what
i
heard
and
to
let
her
tell
father
sheridan
if
she
thought
she
ought
to
and
i
did
it
for
your
own
you
did
and
edith
gibing
laughter
tooted
loudly
you
did
you
did
have
any
other
reason
oh
no
you
do
want
to
break
it
up
between
bobby
lamhorn
and
me
because
edie
now
now
hush
up
mamma
i
like
to
know
then
if
she
says
her
new
friends
tell
her
he
got
such
a
reputation
that
he
ought
to
come
here
what
about
his
not
going
to
her
house
how
explained
that
to
mother
sibyl
voice
indicated
that
she
was
descending
the
stairs
people
are
not
the
same
some
things
that
should
be
shielded
from
a
young
girl
this
seemed
to
have
no
very
soothing
effect
upon
edith
from
a
young
girl
she
shrilled
seem
pretty
willing
to
be
the
shield
you
look
out
roscoe
does
notice
what
kind
of
a
shield
you
are
sibyl
answer
was
inaudible
but
sheridan
flurried
attempts
at
pacification
were
renewed
edie
edie
she
means
it
for
your
good
and
you
ought
to
hush
up
mamma
and
let
me
alone
if
you
dare
tell
papa
now
i
not
going
to
tell
him
and
maybe
got
to
promise
never
to
tell
him
the
girl
cried
passionately
we
see
you
just
come
back
in
your
own
room
and
we
i
wo
it
over
stop
pulling
me
let
me
alone
and
edith
flinging
herself
violently
upon
bibbs
door
jerked
it
open
swung
round
it
into
the
room
slammed
the
door
behind
her
and
threw
herself
face
down
upon
the
bed
in
such
a
riot
of
emotion
that
she
had
no
perception
of
bibbs
presence
in
the
room
gasping
and
sobbing
in
a
passion
of
tears
she
beat
the
coverlet
and
pillows
with
her
clenched
fists
she
babbled
aloud
cat
bibbs
saw
that
she
did
not
know
he
was
there
and
he
went
softly
toward
the
door
hoping
to
get
away
before
she
became
aware
of
him
but
some
sound
of
his
movement
reached
her
and
she
sat
up
startled
facing
him
i
thought
i
saw
you
go
out
awhile
i
came
back
though
i
sorry
you
hear
me
quarreling
with
sibyl
what
you
said
in
the
hall
you
lie
down
again
edith
i
going
do
she
applied
a
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
emitted
a
sob
and
repeated
her
request
go
i
do
mind
you
you
quiet
anyhow
mamma
so
fussy
and
never
gets
anywhere
i
do
mind
you
at
all
but
i
wish
you
sit
and
he
returned
to
his
chair
beside
the
trunk
ahead
and
cry
all
you
want
edith
he
said
harm
in
that
told
mamma
oh
she
began
choking
vertrees
had
mamma
and
sibyl
and
i
to
tea
one
afternoon
two
weeks
or
so
ago
and
she
had
some
women
there
that
sibyl
been
crazy
to
get
in
with
and
she
just
laid
herself
out
to
make
a
hit
with
and
she
been
running
after
ever
since
and
now
she
comes
over
here
and
says
they
say
bobby
lamhorn
is
so
bad
that
even
though
they
like
his
family
none
of
the
nice
people
in
town
would
let
him
in
their
houses
in
the
first
place
a
falsehood
and
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
and
in
the
second
place
i
know
the
reason
she
did
it
and
what
more
she
knows
i
know
it
i
wo
say
what
it
is
not
yet
because
papa
and
all
of
you
would
think
i
as
crazy
as
she
is
snaky
and
roscoe
such
a
fool
he
probably
quit
speaking
to
me
but
it
true
just
you
watch
her
that
all
i
ask
just
you
watch
that
woman
you
see
as
it
happened
bibbs
was
literally
watching
glancing
from
the
window
he
saw
sibyl
pause
upon
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
old
house
next
door
she
stood
a
moment
in
deep
thought
then
walked
quickly
up
the
path
to
the
door
undoubtedly
with
the
intention
of
calling
but
he
did
not
mention
this
to
his
sister
who
after
delivering
herself
of
a
rather
vague
jeremiad
upon
the
subject
of
her
treacheries
departed
to
her
own
chamber
leaving
him
to
his
speculations
the
chief
of
these
concerned
the
social
elasticities
of
women
sibyl
had
just
been
a
participant
in
a
violent
scene
she
had
suffered
hot
insult
of
a
kind
that
could
not
fail
to
set
her
quivering
with
resentment
and
yet
she
elected
to
betake
herself
to
the
presence
of
people
whom
she
knew
no
more
than
bibbs
marveled
surely
he
reflected
some
traces
of
emotion
must
linger
upon
sibyl
face
or
in
her
manner
she
could
not
have
ironed
it
all
quite
out
in
the
three
or
four
minutes
it
took
her
to
reach
the
vertreeses
door
and
in
this
he
was
not
mistaken
for
mary
vertrees
was
at
that
moment
wondering
what
internal
excitement
roscoe
sheridan
was
striving
to
master
but
sibyl
had
no
idea
that
she
was
allowing
herself
to
exhibit
anything
except
the
gaiety
which
she
conceived
proper
to
the
manner
of
a
casual
caller
she
was
wholly
intent
upon
fulfilling
the
sudden
purpose
that
brought
her
and
she
was
no
more
than
she
was
finely
intelligent
for
sibyl
sheridan
belonged
to
a
type
scriptural
in
its
antiquity
she
was
merely
the
idle
and
intriguer
who
may
and
does
delude
men
of
course
and
the
best
and
dullest
of
her
own
sex
as
well
finding
invariably
strong
supporters
among
these
latter
it
is
a
type
that
has
wrought
some
damage
in
the
world
and
would
have
wrought
greater
save
for
the
check
put
upon
its
power
by
intelligent
women
and
by
its
own
of
perspective
for
it
is
a
type
that
never
sees
itself
sibyl
followed
her
impulses
with
no
reflection
or
question
it
was
like
a
hound
on
the
gallop
after
a
master
on
horseback
she
had
not
even
the
instinct
to
stop
and
consider
her
effect
if
she
wished
to
make
a
certain
impression
she
believed
that
she
made
it
she
believed
that
she
was
believed
mother
asked
me
to
say
that
she
was
sorry
she
could
come
down
mary
said
when
they
were
seated
sibyl
ran
the
scale
of
a
cooing
simulance
of
laughter
which
she
had
been
brought
up
to
consider
the
polite
thing
to
do
after
a
remark
addressed
to
her
by
any
person
with
whom
she
was
not
on
familiar
terms
it
was
intended
partly
as
a
courtesy
and
partly
as
the
foundation
for
an
impression
of
sweetness
thought
i
fly
in
a
minute
she
said
continuing
the
cooing
to
relieve
the
last
doubt
of
her
gentiality
thought
i
just
behave
like
real
country
neighbors
we
are
almost
out
in
the
country
so
far
from
are
we
and
it
seemed
such
a
lovely
day
i
wanted
to
tell
you
how
much
i
enjoyed
meeting
those
nice
people
at
tea
that
afternoon
you
see
coming
here
a
bride
and
never
having
lived
here
before
i
had
to
depend
on
my
husband
friends
almost
entirely
and
i
really
known
scarcely
anybody
sheridan
has
been
so
engrossed
in
business
ever
since
he
was
a
mere
boy
why
of
course
she
paused
with
the
air
of
having
completed
an
explanation
course
said
mary
sympathetically
accepting
it
i
been
seeing
quite
a
lot
of
the
kittersbys
since
that
afternoon
sibyl
went
on
really
delightful
people
indeed
they
are
yes
she
stopped
with
unconscious
abruptness
her
mind
plainly
wandering
to
another
matter
and
mary
perceived
that
she
had
come
upon
a
definite
errand
moreover
a
tensing
of
sibyl
eyelids
in
that
moment
of
abstraction
as
she
looked
aside
from
her
hostess
indicated
that
the
errand
was
a
serious
one
for
the
caller
and
easily
to
be
connected
with
the
slight
but
perceptible
agitation
underlying
her
assumption
of
cheerful
ease
there
was
a
restlessness
of
breathing
a
restlessness
of
hands
kittersby
and
her
daughter
were
chatting
about
some
of
the
people
here
in
town
the
other
day
said
sibyl
repeating
the
cooing
and
protracting
it
said
something
that
took
me
by
surprise
we
were
talking
about
our
mutual
friend
robert
lamhorn
mary
interrupted
her
promptly
you
mean
to
include
my
mother
and
me
she
asked
yes
the
kittersbys
and
you
and
all
of
us
sheridans
i
said
mary
should
consider
robert
lamhorn
a
friend
of
to
her
surprise
sibyl
nodded
eagerly
as
if
greatly
pleased
just
the
way
kittersby
talked
she
cried
with
a
vehemence
that
made
mary
stare
and
i
hear
that
the
way
all
you
old
families
here
speak
of
him
mary
looked
aside
but
otherwise
she
was
able
to
maintain
her
composure
had
the
impression
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
she
said
adding
hastily
your
yes
said
the
caller
absently
is
certainly
a
reputation
for
a
little
gaiety
ought
to
make
a
great
difference
to
married
people
of
course
it
where
young
girls
are
in
question
then
it
may
be
very
very
dangerous
there
are
a
great
many
things
safe
and
proper
for
married
people
that
might
be
imprudent
for
a
young
girl
do
you
agree
miss
vertrees
do
know
returned
the
frank
mary
you
mean
that
you
intend
to
remain
a
friend
of
lamhorn
but
disapprove
of
miss
doing
so
it
exactly
was
the
naive
and
ardent
response
of
sibyl
i
feel
about
it
is
that
a
man
with
his
reputation
is
at
all
suitable
for
edith
and
the
family
ought
to
be
made
to
understand
it
i
tell
you
she
cried
with
a
sudden
access
of
vehemence
father
ought
to
put
his
foot
down
her
eyes
flashed
with
a
green
spark
something
seemed
to
leap
out
and
then
retreat
but
not
before
mary
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
as
one
might
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
thing
darting
forth
and
then
scuttling
back
into
hiding
under
a
bush
course
said
sibyl
much
more
composedly
hardly
need
say
that
it
entirely
on
edith
account
that
i
worried
about
this
i
as
fond
of
edith
as
if
she
was
really
my
sister
and
i
ca
help
fretting
about
it
it
would
break
my
heart
to
have
edith
life
this
tune
was
off
the
key
to
mary
ear
sibyl
tried
to
sing
with
pathos
but
she
flatted
and
when
a
lady
receives
a
call
from
another
who
suffers
under
the
stress
of
some
feeling
which
she
wishes
to
conceal
there
is
not
uncommonly
developed
a
phenomenon
of
duality
comparable
to
the
effect
obtained
by
placing
two
mirrors
opposite
each
other
one
clear
and
the
other
flawed
in
this
case
particularly
sibyl
had
an
imperfect
consciousness
of
mary
the
mary
vertrees
that
she
saw
was
merely
something
to
be
cozened
to
her
own
frantic
purpose
a
mary
vertrees
who
was
incapable
of
penetrating
that
purpose
sibyl
sat
there
believing
that
she
was
projecting
the
image
of
herself
that
she
desired
to
project
never
dreaming
that
with
every
word
every
look
and
every
gesture
she
was
more
and
more
fully
disclosing
the
pitiable
truth
to
the
clear
eyes
of
mary
and
the
sibyl
that
mary
saw
was
an
overdressed
woman
in
manner
half
rustic
and
in
mind
as
shallow
as
a
pan
but
possessed
by
emotions
that
appeared
to
be
strong
perhaps
even
violent
what
those
emotions
were
mary
had
not
guessed
but
she
began
to
suspect
edith
life
would
be
spoiled
sibyl
continued
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
for
the
whole
family
she
the
very
apple
of
father
sheridan
eye
and
he
as
proud
of
her
as
he
is
of
jim
and
roscoe
it
would
be
a
horrible
thing
for
him
to
have
her
marry
a
man
like
robert
lamhorn
but
he
does
know
anything
about
him
and
if
somebody
tell
him
what
i
most
afraid
of
is
that
edith
might
get
his
consent
and
hurry
on
the
wedding
before
he
finds
out
and
then
it
would
be
too
late
you
see
miss
vertrees
it
very
difficult
for
me
to
decide
just
what
it
my
duty
to
see
said
mary
looking
at
her
thoughtfully
miss
sheridan
seem
to
to
care
very
much
about
him
deliberately
fascinated
her
returned
the
visitor
beginning
to
breathe
quickly
and
heavily
she
was
difficult
she
knew
she
was
in
right
in
this
town
and
she
was
crazy
to
meet
the
people
that
were
and
she
thought
he
was
one
of
but
that
was
only
the
start
that
made
it
easy
for
him
and
he
did
need
it
he
could
have
done
it
anyway
sibyl
was
launched
now
her
eyes
were
furious
and
her
voice
shook
went
after
her
deliberately
the
way
he
does
everything
as
as
a
fish
all
he
cares
about
is
his
own
pleasure
and
lately
he
decided
it
would
be
pleasant
to
get
hold
of
a
piece
of
real
money
and
there
was
edith
and
he
marry
her
nothing
on
earth
can
stop
him
unless
he
finds
out
she
wo
have
any
money
if
she
marries
him
and
the
only
person
that
could
make
him
understand
that
is
father
sheridan
somehow
that
got
to
be
managed
because
lamhorn
is
going
to
hurry
it
on
as
fast
as
he
can
he
told
me
so
last
night
he
said
he
was
going
to
marry
her
the
first
minute
he
could
persuade
her
to
it
and
little
edith
all
ready
to
be
persuaded
sibyl
eyes
flashed
green
again
he
swore
he
do
it
she
panted
swore
he
marry
edith
sheridan
and
nothing
on
earth
could
stop
him
and
then
mary
understood
her
lips
parted
and
she
stared
at
the
babbling
creature
incredulously
a
sudden
vivid
picture
in
her
mind
a
canvas
of
unconscious
sibyl
painting
mary
beheld
it
with
pity
and
horror
she
saw
sibyl
clinging
to
robert
lamhorn
raging
in
a
whisper
perhaps
for
roscoe
might
have
been
in
the
house
or
servants
might
have
heard
she
saw
sibyl
entreating
beseeching
threatening
despairingly
and
lamhorn
tired
of
her
first
evasive
then
brutally
letting
her
have
the
truth
and
at
last
infuriated
to
marry
her
rival
if
sibyl
had
not
babbled
out
the
word
it
might
have
been
less
plain
the
poor
woman
blundered
on
wholly
unaware
of
what
she
had
confessed
see
she
said
more
quietly
going
to
be
done
ought
to
be
done
right
away
i
went
over
and
told
mother
sheridan
what
i
heard
about
lamhorn
oh
i
was
open
and
aboveboard
i
told
her
right
before
edith
i
think
it
ought
all
to
be
done
with
perfect
frankness
because
nobody
can
say
it
is
for
the
girl
own
good
and
what
her
best
friend
would
do
but
mother
sheridan
under
edith
thumb
and
she
afraid
to
ever
come
right
out
with
anything
father
sheridan
different
edith
can
get
anything
she
wants
out
of
him
in
the
way
of
money
or
ordinary
indulgence
but
when
it
comes
to
a
matter
like
this
he
be
a
steel
rock
if
it
a
question
of
his
will
against
anybody
else
he
make
his
will
rule
if
it
killed
both
now
he
never
in
the
world
let
lamhorn
come
near
the
house
again
if
he
knew
his
reputation
so
you
see
somebody
got
to
tell
him
it
is
a
very
easy
position
for
me
is
it
miss
vertrees
said
mary
gravely
to
be
frank
said
sibyl
smiling
why
i
come
to
me
mary
frowned
sibyl
rippled
and
cooed
again
is
anybody
ever
made
such
a
hit
with
father
sheridan
in
his
life
as
you
have
and
of
course
we
all
hope
you
not
going
to
be
exactly
an
outsider
in
the
affairs
of
the
family
this
sally
with
another
and
louder
effect
of
laughter
if
it
my
duty
why
in
a
way
i
think
it
might
be
thought
yours
no
exclaimed
mary
sharply
said
sibyl
suppose
i
go
to
father
sheridan
with
this
story
and
edith
says
it
not
true
suppose
she
says
lamhorn
has
a
good
reputation
and
that
i
repeating
irresponsible
gossip
or
suppose
what
most
likely
she
loses
her
temper
and
says
i
invented
it
then
what
am
i
going
to
do
father
sheridan
does
know
kittersby
and
her
daughter
and
they
out
of
the
question
anyway
but
suppose
i
could
say
right
if
you
want
proof
ask
miss
vertrees
she
came
with
me
and
she
waiting
in
the
next
room
right
now
to
no
said
mary
quickly
must
just
a
minute
more
sibyl
urged
confidingly
she
was
on
easy
ground
now
to
her
own
mind
and
had
no
doubt
of
her
success
naturally
do
want
to
begin
by
taking
part
in
a
family
quarrel
but
if
you
take
part
in
it
it
wo
be
one
you
do
know
yourself
what
weight
you
carry
over
there
and
no
one
would
have
the
right
to
say
you
did
it
except
out
of
the
purest
kindness
do
you
see
that
jim
and
his
father
would
admire
you
all
the
more
for
it
miss
vertrees
listen
do
you
see
we
ought
to
do
it
you
and
i
do
you
suppose
robert
lamhorn
cares
a
snap
of
his
finger
for
her
do
you
suppose
a
man
like
him
would
look
at
edith
sheridan
if
it
was
for
the
money
and
again
sibyl
emotion
rose
to
the
surface
tell
you
he
after
nothing
on
earth
but
to
get
his
finger
in
that
old
man
over
there
next
door
he
marry
anybody
to
do
it
marry
edith
she
cried
tell
you
he
marry
their
nigger
cook
for
that
she
stopped
afraid
at
the
wrong
time
that
she
had
been
too
vehement
but
a
glance
at
mary
reassured
her
and
sibyl
decided
that
she
had
produced
the
effect
she
wished
mary
was
not
looking
at
her
she
was
staring
straight
before
her
at
the
wall
her
eyes
wide
and
shining
she
became
visibly
a
little
paler
as
sibyl
looked
at
her
nothing
on
earth
but
to
get
his
finger
in
that
old
over
there
next
door
the
voice
was
vulgar
the
words
were
vulgar
and
the
plain
truth
was
vulgar
how
it
rang
in
mary
ears
the
clear
mirror
had
caught
its
own
image
clearly
in
the
flawed
one
at
last
sibyl
put
forth
her
best
bid
to
clench
the
matter
she
offered
her
bargain
do
you
worry
she
said
sunnily
this
setting
edith
against
you
she
get
over
it
after
a
while
anyway
but
if
she
tried
to
be
spiteful
and
make
it
uncomfortable
for
you
when
you
drop
in
over
there
or
managed
so
as
to
sort
of
leave
you
out
why
i
got
a
house
and
jim
likes
to
come
there
i
do
think
edith
would
be
that
way
she
too
crazy
to
have
you
take
her
around
with
the
smart
crowd
but
if
she
did
you
need
worry
and
another
thing
i
guess
you
mind
jim
own
speaking
of
it
of
course
i
do
know
just
how
matters
stand
between
you
and
jim
but
jim
and
roscoe
are
about
as
much
alike
as
two
brothers
can
be
and
roscoe
was
very
slow
making
up
his
mind
sometimes
i
used
to
think
he
actually
never
would
now
what
i
mean
is
can
do
lots
of
things
to
help
matters
on
like
that
there
lots
of
little
things
can
be
said
and
lots
she
stopped
puzzled
mary
vertrees
had
gone
from
pale
to
scarlet
and
now
still
scarlet
indeed
she
rose
without
a
word
of
explanation
or
any
other
kind
of
word
and
walked
slowly
to
the
open
door
and
out
of
the
room
sibyl
was
a
little
taken
aback
she
supposed
mary
had
remembered
something
neglected
and
necessary
for
the
instruction
of
a
servant
and
that
she
would
return
in
a
moment
but
it
was
rather
a
rude
excess
of
not
to
have
excused
herself
especially
as
her
guest
was
talking
and
mary
return
being
delayed
sibyl
found
time
to
think
this
unprefaced
exit
odder
and
ruder
than
she
had
first
considered
it
there
might
have
been
more
excuse
for
it
she
thought
had
she
been
speaking
of
matters
less
important
offering
to
do
the
girl
all
the
kindness
in
her
power
too
sibyl
yawned
and
swung
her
muff
impatiently
she
examined
the
sole
of
her
shoe
she
decided
on
a
new
shape
of
heel
she
made
an
inventory
of
the
furniture
of
the
room
of
the
rugs
of
the
and
engravings
then
she
looked
at
her
watch
and
frowned
went
to
a
window
and
stood
looking
out
upon
the
brown
lawn
then
came
back
to
the
chair
she
had
abandoned
and
sat
again
there
was
no
sound
in
the
house
a
strange
expression
began
imperceptibly
to
alter
the
planes
of
her
face
and
slowly
she
grew
as
scarlet
as
mary
scarlet
to
the
ears
she
looked
at
her
watch
again
and
minutes
had
elapsed
since
she
had
looked
at
it
before
she
went
into
the
hall
glanced
over
her
shoulder
oddly
then
she
let
herself
softly
out
of
the
front
door
and
went
across
the
street
to
her
own
house
roscoe
met
her
upon
the
threshold
gloomily
you
from
the
window
he
explained
must
find
a
lot
to
say
to
that
old
old
lady
vertrees
i
been
waiting
for
you
a
long
time
and
i
saw
the
daughter
come
out
fifteen
minutes
ago
and
post
a
letter
and
then
walk
on
up
the
street
do
stand
out
on
the
porch
he
said
crossly
in
here
there
something
it
come
time
i
have
to
talk
to
you
about
come
in
but
as
she
was
moving
to
obey
he
glanced
across
at
his
father
house
and
started
he
lifted
his
hand
to
shield
his
eyes
from
the
setting
sun
staring
fixedly
the
matter
over
there
he
muttered
and
then
more
loudly
as
alarm
came
into
his
voice
he
said
the
matter
over
there
bibbs
dashed
out
of
the
gate
in
an
automobile
set
at
its
highest
speed
and
as
he
saw
roscoe
he
made
a
gesture
singularly
eloquent
of
calamity
and
was
lost
at
once
in
a
cloud
of
dust
down
the
street
edith
had
followed
part
of
the
way
down
the
drive
and
it
could
be
seen
that

was
crying
bitterly
she
lifted
both
arms
to
roscoe
summoning

sights
of

city
they
got
into
an
open
car
at
the
main
entrance
of

slowly
and
momentously
through

sheridan
when

they
came
out
to
the
car

a
but
with
his
foot
on
the
step
he
paused
to

waggish

o
the
way
that
boy
took
ahold
o
that
job
back
yonder
four
months
and
a
half
yes
sir
he
expanded
this
theme
once
more
and
thus
he
continued
to
entertain
the
stranger
throughout
the
long
drive
darkness
had
fallen
before
they
reached
the
city
on
their
return
and
it
was
after
five
when
sheridan
allowed
herr
favre
to
descend
at
the
door
of
his
hotel
where
boys
were
shrieking
extra
editions
of
the
evening
paper

sheridan
leaning
from
the
car

sheridan

speaking
to
the
chauffer

me
around
to
the
central
city
boy

want
to
get
a
shave

extry
screamed
the
newsboys
among
the
crowds
like
bats
in
the
dusk
all
about
the
horrable
accident
extry
it
struck
sheridan
that
the
papers
sent
out
too
many
they
printed
for
all
sorts
of
petty
crimes
and
casualties
it
was
a
mistake
he
decided
critically
crying
too
often
would
sell
the
goods
it
was
bad
business
the
papers
would
more
in
the
long
run
he
was
sure
if
they
published
an
only
when
something
of
real
importance
happened
all
about
the
extry
a
boy
squawked
under
his
nose
as
he
descended
from
the
car
on
away
said
sheridan
gruffly
though
he
smiled
he
liked
to
see
the
youngsters
working
so
noisily
to
get
on
in
the
world
but
as
he
crossed
the
pavement
to
the
brilliant
glass
doors
of
the
a
second
newsboy
grasped
the
arm
of
the
one
who
had
thus
cried
his
wares
yallern
said
this
second
hoarse
with
awe
chew
know
who
that
is
sheridan
cried
the
first
staring
insanely
at
about
the
same
hour
four
times
a
week
monday
wednesday
friday
and
saturday
sheridan
stopped
at
this
shop
to
be
shaved
by
the
head
barber
the
barbers
were
negroes
he
was
their
great
man
and
it
was
their
habit
to
give
him
a
his
entrance
being
always
the
signal
for
a
flurry
of
jocular
hospitality
followed
by
general
excesses
of
briskness
and
gaiety
but
it
was
not
so
this
evening
the
shop
was
crowded
copies
of
the
were
being
read
by
men
waiting
and
by
men
in
the
latter
stages
of
treatment
lay
upon
vacant
seats
and
showed
from
the
pockets
of
hanging
coats
there
was
a
loud
chatter
between
the
practitioners
and
their
recumbent
patients
a
vocal
charivari
which
stopped
abruptly
as
sheridan
opened
the
door
his
name
seemed
to
fizz
in
the
air
like
the
last
sputtering
of
a
firework
the
barbers
stopped
shaving
and
clipping
lathered
men
turned
their
prostrate
heads
to
stare
and
there
was
a
moment
of
amazing
silence
in
the
shop
the
head
barber
nearest
the
door
stood
like
a
barber
in
a
tableau
his
left
hand
held
stretched
between
thumb
and
forefinger
an
elastic
section
of
his
helpless
customer
cheek
while
his
right
hand
hung
poised
above
it
the
razor
motionless
and
then
roused
from
trance
by
the
closing
he
accepted
the
fact
of
sheridan
presence
the
barber
remembered
that
there
are
no
circumstances
in
life
or
just
after
it
under
which
a
man
does
not
need
to
be
shaved
he
stepped
forward
profoundly
grave
be
through
with
this
man
in
the
chair
one
minute
mist
sheridan
he
said
in
a
hushed
tone
and
of
a
solemn
negro
youth
who
stood
by
gazing
stupidly
resign
he
demanded
in
a
fierce
undertone
goin
take
sheridan
coat
he
sent
an
angry
look
round
the
shop
and
the
barbers
taking
his
meaning
averted
their
eyes
and
fell
to
work
the
murmur
of
subdued
conversation
buzzing
from
chair
to
chair
sit
down
one
minute
mist
sheridan
said
the
head
barber
gently
fix
nice
chair
fo
you
to
wait
mind
said
sheridan
on
get
through
with
your
and
he
went
quickly
back
to
his
chair
on
tiptoe
followed
by
sheridan
puzzled
gaze
something
had
gone
wrong
in
the
shop
evidently
sheridan
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
ordinarily
he
would
have
shouted
a
hilarious
demand
for
the
meaning
of
the
mystery
but
an
inexplicable
silence
had
been
imposed
upon
him
by
the
hush
that
fell
upon
his
entrance
and
by
the
odd
look
every
man
in
the
shop
had
bent
upon
him
vaguely
disquieted
he
walked
to
one
of
the
seats
in
the
rear
of
the
shop
and
looked
up
and
down
the
two
lines
of
barbers
catching
quickly
shifted
furtive
glances
here
and
there
he
made
this
brief
survey
after
wondering
if
one
of
the
barbers
had
died
suddenly
that
day
or
the
night
before
but
there
was
no
vacancy
in
either
line
the
seat
next
to
his
was
unoccupied
but
some
one
had
left
a
copy
of
the
there
and
frowning
he
picked
it
up
and
glanced
at
it
the
first
of
the
swollen
display
lines
had
little
meaning

thus
far
had
he
read
when
a
thin
hand
fell
upon
the
paper
covering
the
print
from
his
eyes
and
looking
up
he
saw
bibbs
standing
before
him
pale
and
gentle
immeasurably
compassionate
come
for
you
father
said
bibbs
the
boy
with
your
coat
and
hat
put
them
on
and
come
and
even
then
sheridan
did
not
understand
so
secure
was
he
in
the
strength
and
bigness
of
everything
that
was
his
he
did
not
know
what
calamity
had
befallen
him
but
he
was
frightened
without
a
word
he
followed
bibbs
heavily
out
throught
the
still
shop
but
as
they
reached
the
pavement
he
stopped
short
and
grasping
his
son
sleeve
with
shaking
fingers
swung
him
round
so
that
they
stood
face
to
face
what
his
mouth
could
not
do
him

service
he
asked
of
it

was

that

not
know
what

at
the
cemetery
three
days
later
bibbs
unwillingly
let
an
old
old
thought
become
definite
in
his
mind
the
sickly
brother
had
buried
the
strong
brother
and
bibbs
wondered
how
many
million
times
that
had
happened
since
men
first
made
a
word
to
name
the
sons
of
one
mother
almost
literally
he
had
buried
his
strong
brother
for
sheridan
had
gone
to
pieces
when
he
saw
his
dead
son
he
had
nothing
to
help
him
meet
the
shock
neither
definite
religion
nor
definite
or
indefinite
he
could
only
beat
his
forehead
and
beg
over
and
over
to
be
killed
with
an
ax
while
his
wife
was
helpless
except
to
entreat
him
not
to
on
herself
adding
a
continuous
lamentation
edith
weeping
made
truce
with
sibyl
and
saw
to
it
that
the
mourning
garments
were
beyond
criticism
roscoe
was
dazed
and
he
shirked
justifying
himself
curiously
by
saying
he
had
any
experience
in
such
so
it
was
bibbs
the
shy
outsider
who
became
during
this
dreadful
little
time
the
master
of
the
house
for
as
strange
a
thing
as
that
sometimes
may
be
the
result
of
a
death
he
met
the
relatives
from
out
of
town
at
the
station
he
set
the
time
for
the
funeral
and
the
time
for
meals
he
selected
the
flowers
and
he
selected
jim
coffin
he
did
all
the
grim
things
and
all
the
other
things
jim
had
belonged
to
an
order
of
knights
who
lengthened
the
rites
with
a
picturesque
ceremony
of
their
own
and
at
first
bibbs
wished
to
avoid
this
but
upon
reflection
he
offered
no
objection
he
divined
that
the
knights
and
their
service
would
be
not
precisely
a
consolation
but
a
satisfaction
to
his
father
so
the
knights
led
the
procession
with
their
band
playing
a
dirge
part
of
the
long
way
to
the
cemetery
and
then
turned
back
after
forming
in
two
lines
plumed
hats
sympathetically
in
hand
to
let
the
hearse
and
the
carriages
pass
between
men
said
sheridan
brokenly
all
all
liked
him
he
was
his
breath
caught
in
a
sob
and
choked
him
was
a
grand
supreme
bibbs
had
divined
aright
to
dust
said
the
minister
under
the
gaunt
trees
and
at
that
sheridan
shook
convulsively
from
head
to
foot
all
of
the
black
group
shivered
except
bibbs
when
it
came
to
to
bibbs
stood
passive
for
he
was
the
only
one
of
them
who
had
known
that
thought
as
a
familiar
neighbor
he
had
been
close
upon
dust
himself
for
a
long
long
time
and
even
now
he
could
prophesy
no
protracted
separation
between
himself
and
dust
the
had
brought
him
very
close
and
if
he
had
to
go
back
it
would
probably
bring
him
closer
still
so
close
as
gurney
predicted
that
no
one
would
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
between
dust
and
himself
and
sheridan
if
bibbs
read
him
truly
would
be
all
the
more
determined
to
a
of
him
now
that
there
was
a
man
less
in
the
family
to
bibbs
knowledge
no
one
and
nothing
had
ever
prevented
his
father
from
carrying
through
his
plans
once
he
had
determined
upon
them
and
sheridan
was
incapable
of
believing
that
any
plan
of
his
would
not
work
out
according
to
his
calculations
his
nature
unfitted
him
to
accept
failure
he
had
the
gift
of
terrible
persistence
and
with
unflecked
confidence
that
his
way
was
the
only
way
he
would
hold
to
that
way
of
a
of
bibbs
who
understood
very
well
in
his
passive
and
impersonal
fashion
that
it
was
a
way
which
might
make
not
a
man
but
dust
of
him
but
he
had
no
shudder
for
the
thought
he
had
no
shudder
for
that
thought
or
for
any
other
thought
the
truth
about
bibbs
was
in
the
poem
which
edith
had
adopted
he
had
so
thoroughly
formed
the
habit
of
hiding
his
feelings
that
no
doubt
he
had
forgotten
by
this
time
where
he
had
put
some
of
them
especially
those
which
concerned
himself
but
he
had
not
hidden
his
feelings
about
his
father
where
they
could
not
be
found
he
was
strange
to
his
father
but
his
father
was
not
strange
to
him
he
knew
that
sheridan
plans
were
conceived
in
the
stubborn
belief
that
they
would
bring
about
a
good
thing
for
bibbs
himself
and
whatever
the
result
was
to
be
the
son
had
no
bitterness
far
otherwise
for
as
he
looked
at
the
big
woeful
figure
shaking
and
tortured
an
almost
unbearable
pity
laid
hands
upon
bibbs
throat
roscoe
stood
blinking
his
lip
quivering
edith
wept
audibly
sheridan
leaned
in
half
collapse
against
her
husband
but
bibbs
knew
that
his
father
was
the
one
who
cared
it
was
over
men
in
overalls
stepped
forward
with
their
shovels
and
bibbs
nodded
quickly
to
roscoe
making
a
slight
gesture
toward
the
line
of
waiting
carriages
roscoe
understood
bibbs
would
stay
and
see
the
grave
filled
the
rest
were
to
go
the
groups
began
to
move
away
over
the
turf
wheels
creaked
on
the
graveled
drive
and
one
by
one
the
carriages
filled
and
departed
the
horses
setting
off
at
a
walk
bibbs
gazed
steadfastly
at
the
workmen
he
knew
that
his
father
kept
looking
back
as
he
went
toward
the
carriage
and
that
was
a
thing
he
did
not
want
to
see
but
after
a
little
while
there
were
no
sounds
of
wheels
or
hoofs
on
the
gravel
and
bibbs
glancing
up
saw
that
every
one
had
gone
a
coupe
had
been
left
for
him
the
driver
dozing
patiently
the
workmen
placed
the
flowers
and
wreaths
upon
the
mound
and
about
it
and
bibbs
altered
the
position
of
one
or
two
of
these
then
stood
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
grotesque
brilliancy
of
that
hillock
beneath
the
darkening
november
sky
too
bad
he
half
whispered
his
lips
forming
the
words
and
his
meaning
was
that
it
was
too
bad
that
the
strong
brother
had
been
the
one
to
go
for
this
was
his
last
thought
before
he
walked
to
the
coupe
and
saw
mary
vertrees
standing
all
alone
on
the
other
side
of
the
drive
she
had
just
emerged
from
a
grove
of
leafless
trees
that
grew
on
a
slope
where
the
tombs
were
many
and
behind
her
rose
a
multitude
of
the
barbaric
and
classic
shapes
we
so
strangely
strew
about
our
graveyards
columns
and
obelisks
angels
and
children
poising
on
pillars
and
shafts
all
lifting
in
unthought
pathos
their
blind
stoniness
toward
the
sky
against
such
a
background
bibbs
was
not
incongruous
with
his
figure
in
black
so
long
and
slender
and
his
face
so
long
and
thin
and
white
nor
was
the
undertaker
coupe
out
of
keeping
with
the
shabby
driver
dozing
on
the
box
and
the
shaggy
horses
standing
patiently
in
attitudes
without
hope
and
without
regret
but
for
mary
vertrees
here
was
a
grotesque
setting
she
was
a
vivid
living
creature
of
a
beautiful
world
and
a
graveyard
is
not
the
place
for
people
to
look
charming
she
also
looked
startled
and
confused
but
not
more
startled
and
confused
than
bibbs
in
poem
he
had
declared
his
intention
of
hiding
his
heart
the
and
in
his
boyhood
one
day
he
had
successfully
hidden
his
body
in
the
he
had
been
no
comrade
of
other
boys
or
of
girls
and
his
acquaintances
of
a
recent
period
were
only
a
few
and
the
nurses
at
the
hood
sanitarium
all
his
life
bibbs
had
kept
himself
to
himself
he
was
but
a
shy
onlooker
in
the
world
nevertheless
the
startled
gaze
he
bent
upon
the
unexpected
lady
before
him
had
causes
other
than
his
shyness
and
her
unexpectedness
for
mary
vertrees
had
been
a
shining
figure
in
the
little
world
of
late
given
to
the
view
of
this
humble
and
elusive
outsider
and
spectators
sometimes
find
their
hearts
beating
faster
than
those
of
the
actors
in
the
spectacle
thus
with
bibbs
now
he
started
and
stared
he
lifted
his
hat
with
incredible
awkwardness
his
fingers
fumbling
at
his
forehead
before
they
found
the
brim
sheridan
said
mary
afraid
you
have
to
take
me
home
with
you
i
she
stopped
not
lacking
a
momentary
awkwardness
of
her
own
why
yes
bibbs
stammered
i
be
de
wo
you
get
in
in
that
manner
and
in
that
place
they
exchanged
their
first
words
then
mary
without
more
ado
got
into
the
coupe
and
bibbs
followed
closing
the
door
very
kind
she
said
somewhat
breathlessly
should
have
had
to
walk
and
it
beginning
to
get
dark
it
three
miles
i
said
bibbs
it
is
beginning
to
get
dark
i
i
noticed
ought
to
tell
you
i
mary
began
confusedly
she
bit
her
lip
sat
silent
a
moment
then
spoke
with
composure
must
seem
odd
my
no
bibbs
protested
earnestly
in
the
in
the
does
though
said
mary
had
not
intended
to
come
to
the
cemetery
sheridan
but
one
of
the
men
in
charge
at
the
house
came
and
whispered
to
me
that
family
wished
me
to
i
think
your
sister
sent
him
so
i
came
but
when
we
reached
here
i
oh
i
felt
that
perhaps
i
bibbs
nodded
gravely
yes
he
murmured
got
out
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
carriage
she
continued
mean
opposite
from
from
where
all
of
you
were
and
i
wandered
off
over
in
the
other
direction
and
i
did
realize
how
little
time
it
takes
from
where
i
was
i
could
see
the
carriages
leaving
at
least
i
notice
them
so
when
i
got
back
just
now
you
were
the
only
one
here
i
did
know
the
other
people
in
the
carriage
i
came
in
and
of
course
they
did
think
to
wait
for
me
that
why
said
bibbs
and
that
seemed
all
he
had
to
say
just
then
mary
looked
out
through
the
dusty
window
think
we
better
be
going
home
if
you
please
she
said
bibbs
agreed
not
moving
will
be
dark
before
we
get
she
gave
him
a
quick
little
glance
think
you
must
be
very
tired
sheridan
and
i
know
you
have
reason
to
be
she
said
gently
you
let
me
i
and
without
explaining
her
purpose
she
opened
the
door
on
her
side
of
the
coupe
and
leaned
out
bibbs
started
in
blank
perplexity
not
knowing
what
she
meant
to
do
she
called
in
her
clear
voice
loudly
we
like
to
start
please
driver
stop
at
the
house
just
north
of
sheridan
the
wheels
began
to
move
and
she
leaned
back
beside
bibbs
once
more
noticed
that
he
was
asleep
when
we
got
in
she
said
suppose
they
have
a
great
deal
of
night
bibbs
drew
a
long
breath
and
waited
till
he
could
command
his
voice
never
been
able
to
apologize
quickly
he
said
with
his
accustomed
slowness
if
i
try
to
i
stammer
my
brother
roscoe
whipped
me
once
when
we
were
boys
for
stepping
on
his
it
took
me
so
long
to
tell
him
it
was
an
accident
he
finished
before
i
mary
vertrees
had
never
heard
anything
quite
like
the
drawling
gentle
voice
or
the
odd
implication
that
his
not
noticing
the
motionless
state
of
their
vehicle
was
an
she
had
formed
a
casual
impression
of
him
not
without
sympathy
but
at
once
she
discovered
that
he
was
unlike
any
of
her
cursory
and
vague
imaginings
of
him
and
suddenly
she
saw
a
picture
he
had
not
intended
to
paint
for
sympathy
a
sturdy
boy
hammering
a
smaller
sickly
boy
and
the
sickly
boy
unresentful
not
that
picture
alone
others
flashed
before
her
instantaneously
she
had
a
glimpse
of
bibbs
life
and
into
his
life
she
had
a
queer
feeling
new
to
her
experience
of
knowing
him
instantly
it
startled
her
a
little
and
then
with
some
surprise
she
realized
that
she
was
glad
he
had
sat
so
long
after
getting
into
the
coupe
before
he
noticed
that
it
had
not
started
what
she
did
not
realize
however
was
that
she
had
made
no
response
to
his
apology
and
they
passed
out
of
the
cemetery
gates
neither
having
spoken
again
bibbs
was
so
content
with
the
silence
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
silence
the
dusk
gathering
in
their
small
inclosure
was
filled
with
a
rich
presence
for
him
and
presently
it
was
so
dark
that
neither
of
the
two
could
see
the
other
nor
did
even
their
garments
touch
but
neither
had
any
sense
of
being
alone
the
wheels
creaked
steadily
rumbling
presently
on
paved
streets
there
were
the
sounds
as
from
a
distance
of
the
of
the
horses
and
sometimes
the
driver
became
audible
coughing
asthmatically
or
saying
joe
with
a
spiritless
flap
of
the
whip
upon
an
unresponsive
back
oblongs
of
light
from
the
lamps
at
came
swimming
into
the
interior
of
the
coupe
and
thinning
rapidly
to
lances
passed
utterly
leaving
greater
darkness
and
yet
neither
of
these
two
last
attendants
at
jim
sheridan
funeral
broke
the
silence
it
was
mary
who
preceived
the
strangeness
of
it
too
late
abruptly
she
realized
that
for
an
indefinite
interval
she
had
been
thinking
of
her
companion
and
not
talking
to
him
sheridan
she
began
not
knowing
what
she
was
going
to
say
but
impelled
to
say
anything
as
she
realized
the
queerness
of
this
drive
sheridan
i
the
coupe
stopped
joe
said
the
driver
reproachfully
and
climbed
down
and
opened
the
door
the
trouble
bibbs
inquired
said
stop
at
the
first
house
north
of
sheridan
mary
was
incredulous
she
felt
that
it
could
be
true
and
that
it
must
be
true
that
they
had
driven
all
the
way
without
speaking
bibbs
demanded
there
sir
said
the
driver
sympathetically
house
north
of
bibbs
descended
to
the
curb
yes
he
said
you
seem
to
be
and
while
he
stood
staring
at
the
dimly
illuminated
front
windows
of
vertrees
house
mary
got
out
unassisted
me
help
you
said
bibbs
stepping
toward
her
mechanically
and
she
was
several
feet
from
the
coupe
when
he
spoke
no
she
murmured
think
i
can
she
meant
that
she
could
get
out
of
the
coupe
without
help
but
perceiving
that
she
had
already
accomplished
this
feat
she
decided
not
to
complete
the
sentence
joe
cried
the
driver
angrily
climbing
to
his
box
and
he
rumbled
away
at
his
team
best
pace
a
snail
you
for
bringing
me
home
sheridan
said
mary
stiffly
she
did
not
offer
her
hand
night
bibbs
said
in
response
and
turning
with
her
walked
beside
her
to
the
door
mary
made
that
a
short
walk
she
almost
ran
realization
of
the
queerness
of
their
drive
was
growing
upon
her
beginning
to
shock
her
she
stepped
aside
from
the
light
that
fell
through
the
glass
panels
of
the
door
and
withheld
her
hand
as
it
touched
the
quite
safe
thank
you
she
said
with
a
little
emphasis
night
said
bibbs
and
went
obediently
when
he
reached
the
street
he
looked
back
but
she
had
vanished
within
the
house
moving
slowly
away
he
caromed
against
two
people
who
were
turning
out
from
the
pavement
to
cross
the
street
they
were
roscoe
and
his
wife
are
your
eyes
bibbs
demanded
roscoe
as
usual
but
sibyl
took
the
wanderer
by
the
arm
over
to
our
house
for
a
little
while
bibbs
she
urged
want
to
i
better
i
want
you
to
your
father
gone
to
bed
and
they
all
quiet
over
there
all
worn
out
just
come
for
a
he
yielded
and
when
they
were
in
the
house
she
repeated
herself
with
real
feeling
worn
out
well
if
anybody
is
you
are
bibbs
and
i
do
wonder
you
done
every
bit
of
the
work
of
it
you
must
get
down
sick
again
i
going
to
make
you
take
a
little
he
let
her
have
her
own
way
following
her
into
the
and
was
grateful
when
she
brought
him
a
tiny
glass
filled
from
one
of
the
decanters
on
the
sideboard
roscoe
gloomily
poured
for
himself
a
much
heavier
libation
in
a
larger
glass
and
the
two
men
sat
while
sibyl
leaned
against
the
sideboard
reviewing
the
episodes
of
the
day
and
recalling
the

she
pressed
bibbs
to
remain
longer
when
he
rose
to
go
and
then
as
he
persisted
she
went
with
him
to
the
front
door
he
opened
it
and
she
said
you
were
coming
out
of
the
vertreeses
house
when
we
met
you
how
did
you
happen
to
be
there
had
only
been
to
the
door
he
said
night
she
insisted
saw
you
coming
was
he
explained
moving
to
depart
just
brought
miss
vertrees
she
cried
he
said
and
stepped
out
upon
the
porch
was
it
good
night
she
said
following
him
across
the
threshold
did
that
happen
i
thought
you
were
going
to
wait
while
those
men
filled
the
the
she
paused
but
moved
nearer
him
insistently
did
wait
miss
vertrees
was
there
he
said
reluctantly
had
walked
away
for
a
while
and
did
notice
that
the
carriages
were
leaving
when
she
came
back
the
coupe
waiting
for
me
was
the
only
one
sibyl
regarded
him
with
dilating
eyes
she
spoke
with
a
slow
breathlessness
she
drove
home
from
jim
funeral
with
you
without
warning
she
burst
into
laughter
clapped
her
hand
ineffectually
over
her
mouth
and
ran
back
uproariously
into
the
house
hurling
the
door
shut
behind

chapter
xiii
bibbs
went
home
pondering
he
did
not
understand
why
sibyl
had
laughed
the
laughter
itself
had
been
spontaneous
and
beyond
suspicion
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
had
only
affected
the
effort
to
suppress
it
and
that
she
wished
it
to
be
significant
significant
of
what
and
why
had
she
wished
to
impress
upon
him
the
fact
of
her
overwhelming
amusement
he
found
no
answer
but
she
had
succeeded
in
disturbing
him
and
he
wished
that
he
had
not
encountered
her
at
home
uncles
aunts
and
cousins
from
out
of
town
were
wandering
about
the
house
several
mournfully
admiring
the
of
naples
and
others
occupied
with
the
moor
and
the
plumbing
while
they
waited
for
trains
edith
and
her
mother
had
retired
to
some
upper
fastness
but
bibbs
interviewed
jackson
and
had
the
various
groups
of
relatives
summoned
to
the
for
food
one
old
gideon
sheridan
from
boonville
could
not
be
found
and
bibbs
went
in
search
of
him
he
ransacked
the
house
discovering
the
missing
antique
at
last
by
accident
passing
his
father
closed
door
on
tiptoe
bibbs
heard
a
murmurous
sound
and
paused
to
listen
the
sound
proved
to
be
a
quavering
and
rickety
voice
monotonously
bleating
givuth
and
the
takuth
away
we
got
to
remember
that
we
got
to
remember
that
i
along
james
i
along
and
i
seen
of
go
two
daughters
and
a
son
the
lord
give
me
and
he
has
taken
all
away
for
the
givuth
and
the
takuth
away
remember
the
words
of
bildad
the
shuhite
james
bildad
the
shuhite
says
shall
have
neither
son
nor
nephew
among
his
people
nor
any
remaining
in
his
dwellings
bildad
the
shuhite
bibbs
opened
the
door
softly
his
father
was
lying
upon
the
bed
in
his
underclothes
face
downward
and
uncle
gideon
sat
near
by
swinging
backward
and
forward
in
a
stroking
his
long
white
beard
and
gazing
at
the
ceiling
as
he
talked
bibbs
beckoned
him
urgently
but
uncle
gideon
paid
no
attention
the
shuhite
spake
and
he
says
thy
children
have
sinned
against
him
and
he
have
cast
them
away
there
was
a
muffled
explosion
beneath
the
floor
and
the
windows
rattled
the
figure
lying
face
downward
on
the
bed
did
not
move
but
uncle
gideon
leaped
from
his
chair
god
he
cried
that
there
came
a
second
explosion
and
uncle
gideon
ran
out
into
the
hall
bibbs
went
to
the
head
of
the
great
staircase
and
looking
down
discovered
the
source
of
the
disturbance
gideon
grandson
a
boy
of
fourteen
had
brought
his
camera
to
the
funeral
and
was
taking
of
the
moor
uncle
gideon
reassured
by
explanation
would
have
returned
to
finish
his
quotation
from
bildad
the
shuhite
but
bibbs
detained
him
and
after
a
little
argument
persuaded
him
to
descend
to
the
whither
bibbs
followed
after
closing
the
door
of
his
father
room
he
kept
his
eye
on
gideon
after
dinner
diplomatically
preventing
several
attempts
on
the
part
of
that
comforter
to
reascend
the
stairs
and
it
was
a
relief
to
bibbs
when
george
announced
that
an
automobile
was
waiting
to
convey
the
ancient
man
and
his
grandson
to
their
train
they
were
the
last
to
leave
and
when
they
had
gone
bibbs
went
sighing
to
his
own
room
he
stretched
himself
wearily
upon
the
bed
but
presently
rose
went
to
the
window
and
looked
for
a
long
time
at
the
darkened
house
where
mary
vertrees
lived
then
he
opened
his
trunk
took
therefrom
a
small
half
filled
with
fragmentary
scribblings
and
began
to
write
laughter
after
a
funeral
in
this
reaction
people
will
laugh
at
anything
and
at
nothing
the
band
plays
a
dirge
on
the
way
to
the
cemetery
but
when
it
turns
back
and
the
mourning
carriages
are
out
of
hearing
it
strikes
up
is
out
that
is
natural
but
there
are
women
whose
laughter
is
like
the
whirring
of
whips
why
is
it
that
certain
kinds
of
laughter
seem
to
spoil
something
hidden
away
from
the
laughers
if
they
do
not
know
of
it
and
have
never
seen
it
how
can
their
laughter
hurt
it
yet
it
does
beauty
is
not
out
of
place
among
it
is
not
out
of
place
anywhere
but
a
woman
who
has
been
betrothed
to
a
man
would
not
look
beautiful
at
his
funeral
a
woman
might
look
beautiful
though
at
the
funeral
of
a
man
whom
she
had
known
and
liked
and
in
that
case
too
she
would
probably
not
want
to
talk
if
she
drove
home
from
the
cemetery
with
his
brother
nor
would
she
want
the
brother
to
talk
silence
is
usually
either
stupid
or
timid
but
for
a
man
who
stammers
if
he
tries
to
talk
fast
and
drawls
so
slowly
when
he
does
stammer
that
nobody
has
time
to
listen
to
him
silence
is
advisable
nevertheless
too
much
silence
is
open
to
suspicion
it
may
be
reticence
or
it
may
be
a
vacuum
it
may
be
dignity
or
it
may
be
false
teeth
sometimes
an
imperceptible
odor
will
become
perceptible
in
a
small
inclosure
such
as
a
closed
carriage
the
ghost
of
gasoline
rising
from
a
lady
glove
might
be
sweeter
to
the
man
riding
beside
her
than
all
the
scents
of
arcady
in
spring
it
depends
on
the
lady
but
there
are
three
miles
may
be
three
hundred
miles
or
it
may
be
three
feet
when
it
is
three
feet
you
have
not
time
to
say
a
great
deal
before
you
reach
the
end
of
it
still
it
may
be
that
one
should
begin
to
speak
no
one
could
help
wishing
to
stay
in
a
world
that
holds
some
of
the
people
that
are
in
this
world
there
are
some
so
wonderful
you
do
not
understand
how
the
dead
could
die
how
could
they
let
themselves
a
falling
building
does
not
care
who
falls
with
it
it
does
not
choose
who
shall
be
upon
its
roof
and
who
shall
not
silence
can
be
golden
yes
but
perhaps
if
a
woman
of
the
world
should
find
herself
by
accident
sitting
beside
a
man
for
the
length
of
time
it
must
necessarily
take
two
slow
old
horses
to
jog
three
miles
she
might
expect
that
man
to
say
something
of
some
sort
even
if
she
thought
him
a
feeble
hypochondriac
even
if
she
had
heard
from
others
that
he
was
a
disappointment
to
his
own
people
even
if
she
had
seen
for
herself
that
he
was
a
useless
and
irritating
encumbrance
everywhere
she
might
expect
him
at
least
to
speak
she
might
expect
him
to
open
his
mouth
and
try
to
make
sounds
if
he
only
barked
if
he
did
not
even
try
but
sat
every
step
of
the
way
as
dumb
as
a
frozen
fish
she
might
think
him
a
frozen
fish
and
she
might
be
right
she
might
be
right
if
she
thought
him
about
as
pleasant
a
companion
as
as
bildad
the
shuhite
bibbs
closed
his
replacing
it
in
his
trunk
then
after
a
period
of
melancholy
contemplation
he
undressed
put
on
a
and
slippers
and
went
softly
out
into
the
hall
to
his
father
door
upon
the
floor
was
a
tray
which
bibbs
had
sent
george
earlier
in
the
evening
to
place
upon
a
table
in
sheridan
room
but
the
food
was
untouched
bibbs
stood
listening
outside
the
door
for
several
minutes
there
came
no
sound
from
within
and
he
went
back
to
his
own
room
and
to
bed
in
the
morning
he
woke
to
a
state
of
being
hitherto
unknown
in
his
experience
sometimes
in
the
process
of
waking
there
is
a
little
pause
sleep
has
gone
but
coherent
thought
has
not
begun
it
is
a
curious
a
glimpse
of
aphasia
and
although
the
person
experiencing
it
may
not
know
for
that
instant
his
own
name
or
age
or
sex
he
may
be
acutely
conscious
of
depression
or
elation
it
is
the
moment
as
we
say
before
we
and
for
the
first
time
in
bibbs
life
it
came
to
him
bringing
a
vague
happiness
he
woke
to
a
sense
of
new
riches
he
had
the
feeling
of
a
boy
waking
to
a
birthday
but
when
the
next
moment
brought
him
his
memory
he
found
nothing
that
could
explain
his
exhilaration
on
the
contrary
under
the
circumstances
it
seemed
grotesquely
unwarranted
however
it
was
a
brief
visitation
and
was
gone
before
he
had
finished
dressing
it
left
a
little
trail
the
pleased
recollection
of
it
and
the
puzzle
of
it
which
remained
unsolved
and
in
fact
waking
happily
in
the
morning
is
not
usually
the
result
of
a
drive
home
from
a
funeral
no
wonder
the
sequence
evaded
bibbs
sheridan
his
father
had
gone
when
he
came
on
down
to
office
jes
same
jackson
informed
him
sat
all
by
eat
nothin
george
bring
nice
breakfas
but
he
eat
a
thing
yessuh
went
on
jes
same
he
yoosta
do
yessuh
i
reckon
putty
much
goin
go
on
same
as
it
yoosta
it
struck
bibbs
that
jackson
was
right
the
day
passed
as
other
days
had
passed
sheridan
and
edith
were
in
black
and
sheridan
cried
a
little
now
and
then
but
no
other
external
difference
was
to
be
seen
edith
was
quiet
but
not
noticeably
depressed
and
at
lunch
proved
herself
able
to
argue
with
her
mother
upon
the
propriety
of
receiving
calls
in
the
earliest
stages
of
lunch
was
as
usual
for
jim
and
his
father
had
always
lunched
and
the
afternoon
was
as
usual
bibbs
went
for
his
drive
and
his
mother
went
with
him
as
she
sometimes
did
when
the
weather
was
pleasant
altogether
the
usualness
of
things
was
rather
startling
to
bibbs
during
the
drive
sheridan
talked
fragmentarily
of
jim
childhood
you
would
remember
about
that
she
said
after
narrating
an
episode
were
too
little
he
was
always
a
good
boy
just
like
that
and
he
save
whatever
papa
gave
him
and
put
it
in
the
bank
i
reckon
it
just
about
kill
your
father
to
put
somebody
in
his
place
as
president
of
the
realty
company
bibbs
i
know
he
ca
move
roscoe
over
he
told
me
last
week
he
already
put
as
much
on
roscoe
as
any
one
man
could
handle
and
not
go
crazy
oh
it
a
pity
she
stopped
to
wipe
her
eyes
a
pity
you
did
run
more
with
jim
bibbs
and
kind
o
pick
up
his
ways
think
what
it
meant
to
papa
now
you
never
did
run
with
either
roscoe
or
jim
any
even
before
you
got
sick
of
course
you
were
younger
but
it
always
did
seem
queer
and
you
three
bein
brothers
like
that
i
do
believe
i
ever
saw
you
and
jim
sit
down
together
for
a
good
talk
in
my
i
been
away
so
long
bibbs
returned
gently
since
i
came
home
i
i
ai
reproachin
you
bibbs
she
said
ai
been
home
much
of
an
evening
since
you
got
back
what
with
his
work
and
and
goin
to
the
theater
and
places
and
often
not
even
at
the
house
for
dinner
right
the
evening
before
he
got
hurt
he
had
his
dinner
at
some
down
by
the
pump
works
he
was
so
set
on
the
night
work
and
gettin
everything
finished
up
right
to
the
minute
he
told
papa
he
would
i
reckon
you
might
put
in
more
time
with
jim
if
there
been
more
opportunity
bibbs
i
expect
you
feel
almost
as
if
you
scarcely
really
knew
him
right
suppose
i
really
did
mother
he
was
busy
you
see
and
i
much
to
say
about
the
things
that
interested
him
because
i
do
know
much
about
a
pity
oh
it
a
pity
she
moaned
you
have
to
learn
to
know
about
now
bibbs
i
have
said
much
to
you
because
i
felt
it
was
all
between
your
father
and
you
but
i
honestly
do
believe
it
will
just
kill
him
if
he
has
to
have
any
more
trouble
on
top
of
all
this
you
must
let
him
bibbs
you
must
you
do
know
how
he
grieved
over
you
and
now
he
ca
stand
any
more
he
just
ca
whatever
he
says
for
you
to
do
you
do
it
bibbs
you
do
it
i
want
you
to
promise
me
you
would
if
i
could
he
said
sorrowfully
no
why
ca
you
she
cried
clutching
his
arm
wants
you
to
go
back
to
the
and
it
said
bibbs
that
it
to
go
in
a
cheerful
spirit
gurney
said
it
hurt
you
if
you
went
in
a
cheerful
spirit
the
doctor
said
that
himself
bibbs
so
why
ca
you
do
it
ca
you
do
that
much
for
your
father
you
ought
to
think
what
he
done
for
you
you
got
a
beautiful
house
to
live
in
you
got
automobiles
to
ride
in
you
got
fur
coats
and
warm
clothes
you
been
taken
care
of
all
your
life
and
you
do
know
how
he
worked
for
the
money
to
give
all
these
things
to
you
you
do
dream
what
he
had
to
go
through
and
what
he
risked
when
we
were
startin
out
in
life
and
you
never
will
know
and
now
this
blow
has
fallen
on
him
out
of
a
clear
sky
and
you
make
it
out
to
be
a
hardship
to
do
like
he
wants
you
to
and
all
on
earth
he
asks
is
for
you
to
go
back
to
the
work
in
a
cheerful
spirit
so
it
wo
hurt
you
that
all
he
asks
look
bibbs
we
gettin
back
near
home
but
before
we
get
there
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
you
do
what
he
asks
you
to
promise
me
in
her
earnestness
she
cleared
away
her
black
veil
that
she
might
see
him
better
and
it
blew
out
on
the
smoky
wind
he
readjusted
it
for
her
before
he
spoke
go
back
in
as
cheerful
a
spirit
as
i
can
mother
he
said
she
exclaimed
satisfied
a
good
boy
that
all
i
wanted
you
to
give
me
any
credit
he
said
ruefully
is
anything
else
for
me
to
do
begin
talkin
that
way
no
he
soothed
her
have
to
begin
to
make
the
spirit
a
cheerful
one
we
may
they
were
turning
into
their
own
driveway
as
he
spoke
and
he
glanced
at
the
old
house
next
door
mary
vertrees
was
visible
in
the
twilight
standing
upon
the
front
steps
bareheaded
the
door
open
behind
her
she
bowed
gravely
may
what
asked
sheridan
with
a
slight
impatience
is
it
mother
said
may
and
did
finish
what
you
were
i
said
bibbs
blankly
what
were
we
saying
all
the
queer
boys
she
cried
always
were
always
you
have
forgot
what
you
just
promised
me
have
you
he
answered
as
the
car
stopped
the
spirit
will
be
as
cheerful
as
the
flesh
will
let
it
mother
it
wo
do
to
behave
like
his
voice
was
low
and
in
her
movement
to
descend
from
the
car
she
failed
to
hear
his
final
words
like
who
bibbs
but
she
was
fretful
in
her
grief
said
it
would
do
to
behave
like
somebody
behave
like
who
was
just
nonsense
he
explained
turning
to
go
in
obscure
person
i
do
think
much
of
like
who
she
repeated
and
upon
his
yielding
to
her
petulant
insistence
she
made
up
her
mind
that
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
tell
gurney
about
it
bildad
the
shuhite
was
what
bibbs
said
chapter
xiv
the
outward
usualness
of
things
continued
after
dinner
it
was
sheridan
custom
to
read
the
evening
paper
beside
the
fire
in
the
library
while
his
wife
sitting
near
by
either
sewed
from
old
habit
or
allowed
herself
to
be
repeatedly
baffled
by
one
of
the
simpler
forms
of
solitaire
she
did
neither
but
sat
in
her
customary
chair
gazing
at
the
fire
while
sheridan
let
the
unfolded
paper
rest
upon
his
lap
though
now
and
then
he
lifted
it
as
if
to
read
and
let
it
fall
back
upon
his
knees
again
bibbs
came
in
noiselessly
and
sat
in
a
corner
doing
nothing
and
from
a
across
the
hall
an
indistinct
vocal
murmur
became
just
audible
at
intervals
once
when
this
murmur
grew
louder
under
stress
of
some
irrepressible
merriment
edith
voice
could
be
heard
are
you
awful
and
sheridan
glanced
across
at
his
wife
appealingly
she
rose
at
once
and
went
into
the
there
was
a
flurry
of
whispering
and
the
sound
of
tiptoeing
in
the
hall
edith
and
her
suitor
changing
quarters
to
a
more
distant
room
sheridan
returned
to
her
chair
in
the
library
wo
bother
you
any
more
papa
she
said
in
a
comforting
voice
told
me
at
lunch
he
he
wanted
to
come
up
this
evening
and
i
said
i
thought
he
better
wait
a
few
days
but
she
said
already
told
him
he
she
paused
then
added
rather
guiltily
got
kind
of
a
notion
maybe
roscoe
do
like
him
as
much
as
he
used
to
maybe
maybe
you
better
ask
roscoe
and
as
sheridan
nodded
solemnly
she
concluded
in
haste
say
i
said
to
i
might
be
wrong
about
it
he
nodded
again
and
they
sat
for
some
time
in
a
silence
which
sheridan
broke
with
a
little
sniff
having
fallen
into
a
reverie
that
brought
tears
miss
vertrees
was
a
good
girl
she
said
was
all
her
husband
evidently
had
no
difficulty
in
following
her
train
of
thought
for
he
nodded
once
more
affirmatively
you
how
did
you
fix
it
about
the
the
realty
company
she
faltered
you
he
rose
heavily
helping
himself
to
his
feet
by
the
arms
of
his
chair
fixed
it
he
said
in
a
husky
voice
moved
cantwell
up
and
put
johnston
in
cantwell
place
and
split
up
johnston
work
among
the
four
men
with
salaries
high
enough
to
take
he
went
to
her
put
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
drew
a
long
audible
tremulous
breath
my
bedtime
mamma
i
goin
he
dropped
the
hand
from
her
shoulder
and
moved
slowly
away
but
when
he
reached
the
door
he
stopped
and
spoke
again
without
turning
to
look
at
her
realty
go
right
on
just
the
same
he
said
like
it
like
sand
mamma
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
chuldern
playin
in
a
one
of
sticks
his
finger
in
the
sand
and
makes
a
hole
and
another
of
pat
the
place
with
his
hand
and
all
the
little
grains
of
sand
run
in
and
fill
it
up
and
settle
against
one
another
and
then
right
away
it
flat
on
top
again
and
you
ca
tell
there
ever
was
a
hole
there
the
realty
company
go
on
all
right
mamma
there
ai
anything
anywhere
i
reckon
that
would
go
right
on
just
the
and
he
passed
out
slowly
into
the
hall
then
they
heard
his
heavy
tread
upon
the
stairs
sheridan
rising
to
follow
him
turned
a
piteous
face
to
her
son
so
forlone
she
said
chokingly
the
first
time
he
spoke
since
he
came
in
the
house
this
evening
i
know
it
must
hurt
him
to
hear
edith
laughin
with
that
lamhorn
she
ought
to
let
him
come
right
the
very
first
evening
this
way
she
ought
to
done
it
she
just
seems
to
lose
her
head
over
him
and
it
scares
me
you
heard
what
sibyl
said
the
other
day
and
and
you
heard
what
what
edith
said
to
sibyl
bibbs
finished
the
sentence
for
her
ca
have
any
trouble
o
that
kind
she
wailed
it
looks
as
if
movin
up
to
this
new
house
had
brought
us
awful
bad
luck
it
scares
me
she
put
both
her
hands
over
her
face
bibbs
bibbs
if
you
only
was
so
queer
if
you
could
only
been
a
kind
of
dependable
son
i
do
know
what
we
all
comin
to
and
weeping
she
followed
her
husband
bibbs
gazed
for
a
while
at
the
fire
then
he
rose
abruptly
like
a
man
who
has
come
to
a
decision
and
briskly
sought
the
room
it
was
called
where
edith
sat
with
lamhorn
they
looked
up
in
no
welcoming
manner
at
bibbs
entrance
and
moved
their
chairs
to
a
less
conspicuous
adjacency
evening
said
bibbs
pleasantly
and
he
seated
himself
in
a
leather
near
them
is
it
asked
edith
plainly
astonished
he
returned
smiling
she
frowned
you
want
something
she
asked
in
the
world
father
and
mother
have
gone
i
be
going
up
for
several
hours
and
there
did
seem
to
be
anybody
left
for
me
to
chat
with
except
you
and
with
she
echoed
incredulously
can
talk
about
almost
anything
said
bibbs
with
an
air
of
genial
politeness
does
matter
to
me
i
do
know
much
about
business
if
that
what
you
happened
to
be
talking
about
but
you
are
in
business
are
you
lamhorn
now
returned
lamhorn
shortly
not
either
said
bibbs
was
getting
cloudier
than
usual
i
noticed
just
before
dark
and
there
was
wind
from
the
southwest
rain
i
should
be
he
seemed
to
feel
that
he
had
begun
a
conversation
the
support
of
which
had
now
become
the
pleasurable
duty
of
other
parties
and
he
sat
expectantly
looking
first
at
his
sister
then
at
lamhorn
as
if
implying
that
it
was
their
turn
to
speak
edith
returned
his
gaze
with
a
mixture
of
astonishment
and
increasing
anger
while
lamhorn
was
obviously
disturbed
though
bibbs
had
been
as
considerate
as
possible
in
presenting
the
weather
as
a
topic
bibbs
had
perceived
that
lamhorn
had
nothing
in
his
mind
at
any
time
except
he
could
talk
about
people
and
he
could
make
love
bibbs
wishing
to
be
courteous
offered
the
weather
lamhorn
refused
it
and
concluded
from
bibbs
luxurious
attitude
in
the
leather
chair
that
this
brother
was
a
permanent
fixture
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
there
was
not
reason
to
hope
that
he
would
move
and
lamhorn
found
himself
in
danger
of
looking
silly
was
just
going
he
said
rising
no
edith
cried
sharply
good
night
i
think
i
bad
said
bibbs
genially
walking
to
the
door
with
the
visitor
while
edith
stood
staring
as
the
two
disappeared
in
the
hall
she
heard
bibbs
offering
to
lamhorn
with
his
overcoat
and
the
latter
rather
curtly
declining
assistance
these
episodes
of
departure
being
followed
by
the
closing
of
the
outer
door
she
ran
into
the
hall
the
matter
with
you
she
cried
furiously
do
you
mean
how
did
you
dare
come
in
there
when
you
knew
her
voice
broke
she
made
a
gesture
of
rage
and
despair
and
ran
up
the
stairs
sobbing
she
fled
to
her
mother
room
and
when
bibbs
came
up
a
few
minutes
later
sheridan
met
him
at
his
door
bibbs
she
said
shaking
her
head
woefully
ought
to
distress
your
sister
she
says
you
drove
that
young
man
right
out
of
the
house
you
ought
to
been
more
bibbs
smiled
faintly
noting
that
edith
door
was
open
with
naive
shadow
motionless
across
its
threshold
he
said
does
appear
to
be
much
of
a
man
he
ran
at
just
a
glimpse
of
edith
shadow
moved
her
voice
came
quavering
call
yourself
one
no
he
answered
said
a
glimpse
of
one
i
claim
but
her
door
slammed
angrily
and
he
turned
to
his
mother
he
said
sighing
almost
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
ever
tried
to
be
a
man
of
action
mother
and
i
succeeded
perfectly
in
what
i
tried
to
do
as
a
consequence
i
feel
like
a
hurt
her
feelin
she
groaned
must
gone
at
it
too
rough
he
looked
upon
her
wanly
my
trouble
mother
he
murmured
a
plain
blunt
fellow
i
have
rough
ways
and
i
a
rough
for
once
she
perceived
some
meaning
in
his
queerness
your
nonsense
she
said
the
astral
of
a
troubled
smile
appearing
go
to
he
kissed
her
and
obeyed
edith
gave
him
a
cold
greeting
the
next
morning
at
the
must
do
that
under
a
misapprehension
he
warned
her
when
they
were
alone
in
the
what
under
a
what
she
asked
to
me
i
came
into
the
last
night
purpose
he
told
her
gravely
have
a
prejudice
against
that
young
she
laughed
guess
you
think
it
means
a
great
deal
who
you
have
prejudices
against
in
mockery
she
adopted
the
manner
of
one
who
implores
for
pity
sake
promise
me
do
use
your
influence
with
papa
against
him
and
she
laughed
louder
he
said
with
peculiar
earnestness
tell
you
now
because
because
i
decided
i
one
of
the
and
then
as
if
the
earnestness
were
too
heavy
for
him
to
carry
it
further
he
continued
in
his
usual
tone
drunk
with
power
do
you
want
to
tell
me
she
demanded
brusquely
made
love
to
sibyl
he
said
edith
hooted
did
to
him
and
because
you
overheard
that
spat
between
us
the
other
day
when
i
the
same
as
accused
her
of
it
and
said
something
like
that
to
you
afterward
he
said
gravely
was
there
one
day
a
week
ago
with
roscoe
and
i
heard
sibyl
and
lamhorn
edith
screamed
with
laughter
were
with
roscoe
and
you
heard
lamhorn
making
love
to
sibyl
i
heard
them
funnier
than
ever
bibbs
she
cried
say
he
made
love
to
her
because
you
heard
them
quarreling
it
if
you
want
to
know
what
people
you
can
by
the
way
they
kill
me
bibbs
what
were
they
quarreling
about
that
how
i
knew
people
who
quarrel
over
nothing
always
certain
edith
stopped
laughing
abruptly
but
continued
her
mockery
ought
to
know
you
had
so
much
experience
yourself
have
any
edith
he
said
life
has
been
about
as
exciting
as
an
incubator
chicken
but
i
look
out
through
the
glass
at
then
she
said
you
look
out
through
the
glass
you
must
know
what
effect
such
stuff
would
have
upon
me
she
rose
visibly
agitated
if
it
was
true
she
demanded
bitterly
if
it
was
true
a
hundred
times
over
you
sit
there
with
your
silly
face
half
ready
to
giggle
and
half
ready
to
sniffle
and
tell
me
stories
like
that
about
sibyl
picking
on
bobby
lamhorn
and
worrying
him
to
death
and
you
think
it
matters
to
me
what
if
i
already
knew
all
about
their
what
if
i
understood
why
she
she
broke
off
with
a
violent
gesture
a
sweep
of
her
arm
extended
at
full
length
as
if
she
hurled
something
to
the
ground
you
think
a
girl
that
really
cared
for
a
man
would
pay
any
attention
to
that
or
to
you
bibbs
sheridan
he
looked
at
her
steadily
and
his
gaze
was
as
keen
as
it
was
steady
she
met
it
with
unwavering
pride
finally
he
nodded
slowly
as
if
she
had
spoken
and
he
meant
to
agree
with
what
she
said
yes
he
said
wo
come
into
the
again
sorry
edith
nobody
can
make
you
see
anything
now
you
never
see
until
you
see
for
yourself
the
rest
of
us
will
do
better
to
keep
out
of
it
especially
me
sensible
she
responded
curtly
most
surprising
of
all
when
you
sensible
he
sighed
a
dull
dog
shake
hands
and
forgive
me
thawing
so
far
as
to
smile
she
underwent
this
brief
ceremony
and
george
appeared
summoning
bibbs
to
the
library
gurney
was
waiting
there
he
announced
and
bibbs
gave
his
sister
a
shy
but
friendly
touch
upon
the
shoulder
as
a
complement
to
the
handshaking
and
left
her
gurney
was
sitting
by
the
log
fire
alone
in
the
room
and
he
merely
glanced
over
his
shoulder
when
his
patient
came
in
he
was
not
over
fifty
in
spite
of
sheridan
habitual
doc
he
was
gray
however
almost
as
thin
as
bibbs
and
nearly
always
he
looked
drowsy
father
telephoned
me
yesterday
afternoon
bibbs
he
said
not
rising
me
to
you
over
again
come
around
here
in
front
of
me
between
me
and
the
fire
i
want
to
see
if
i
can
see
through
mean
you
too
sleepy
to
move
returned
bibbs
complying
think
you
notice
that
i
getting
on
about
twelve
pounds
said
gurney
it
wo
the
doctor
rubbed
his
eyelids
so
much
better
i
have
to
use
some
machinery
on
you
before
we
can
know
just
where
you
are
you
come
down
to
my
place
this
afternoon
walk
down
all
the
way
i
suppose
you
know
why
your
father
wants
to
bibbs
nodded
hate
it
bibbs
nodded
again
blame
you
the
doctor
grunted
i
expect
it
make
a
lump
in
your
gizzard
again
well
what
do
you
say
shall
i
tell
him
got
the
old
lump
there
yet
you
still
want
to
write
do
you
the
use
bibbs
said
smiling
ruefully
kind
of
writing
the
doctor
agreed
suppose
if
you
broke
away
and
lived
on
roots
and
berries
until
you
began
to
the
favorable
attention
of
editors
you
might
be
able
to
hope
for
an
income
of
four
or
five
hundred
dollars
a
year
by
the
time
you
about
it
bibbs
murmured
course
i
know
what
you
want
to
do
said
gurney
drowsily
do
hate
the
only
you
hate
the
whole
show
the
noise
and
jar
and
dirt
the
scramble
the
whole
bloomin
craze
to
on
like
to
go
somewhere
in
algiers
or
to
taormina
perhaps
and
bask
on
a
balcony
smelling
flowers
and
writing
sonnets
you
grow
fat
on
it
and
have
a
delicate
little
life
all
to
yourself
well
what
do
you
say
i
can
lie
like
sixty
bibbs
shall
i
tell
your
father
he
lose
another
of
his
boys
if
you
do
go
to
sicily
do
want
to
go
to
sicily
said
bibbs
want
to
stay
right
the
doctor
drowsiness
disappeared
for
a
moment
and
he
gave
his
patient
a
sharp
glance
a
risk
he
said
think
we
find
you
so
much
better
he
send
you
back
to
the
shop
pretty
quick
something
got
hold
of
you
lately
you
not
quite
so
lackadaisical
as
you
used
to
be
but
i
warn
you
i
think
the
shop
will
knock
you
just
as
it
did
before
and
perhaps
even
harder
he
rose
shook
himself
and
rubbed
his
eyelids
when
we
go
over
you
this
afternoon
what
are
we
going
to
say
about
it
him
i
ready
said
bibbs
looking
at
the
floor
no
gurney
laughed
quite
yet
but
you
may
be
almost
see
do
forget
i
said
to
walk
and
when
the
examination
was
concluded
that
afternoon
the
doctor
informed
bibbs
that
the
result
was
much
too
satisfactory
to
be
pleasing
a
new
for
a
farce
he
said
gloomily
to
his
next
patient
when
bibbs
had
gone
tells
a
man
he
well
and
that
his
death
sentence
likely
dam
funny
world
bibbs
decided
to
walk
home
though
gurney
had
not
instructed
him
upon
this
point
in
fact
gurney
seemed
to
have
no
more
instructions
on
any
point
so
discouraging
was
the
young
man
improvement
it
was
a
dingy
afternoon
and
the
smoke
was
evident
not
only
to
bibbs
sight
but
to
his
nostrils
though
most
of
the
pedestrians
were
so
saturated
with
the
smell
they
could
no
longer
detect
it
nearly
all
of
them
walked
hurriedly
too
intent
upon
their
destinations
to
be
more
than
half
aware
of
the
wayside
they
wore
the
expressions
of
people
under
a
vague
yet
constant
strain
they
were
all
lightly
powdered
inside
and
out
with
fine
dust
and
grit
from
the
streets
and
they
were
unaware
of
that
also
they
did
not
even
notice
that
they
saw
the
smoke
though
the
thickened
air
was
like
a
shrouding
mist
and
when
bibbs
passed
the
new
apartments
now
almost
completed
he
observed
that
the
marble
of
the
vestibule
was
already
streaky
with
soot
like
his
gloves
which
were
new
that
recalled
to
him
the
faint
odor
of
gasolene
in
the
coupe
on
the
way
from
his
brother
funeral
and
this
incited
a
train
of
thought
which
continued
till
he
reached
the
vicinity
of
his
home
his
route
was
by
a
street
parallel
to
that
on
which
the
new
house
fronted
and
in
his
preoccupation
he
walked
a
block
farther
than
he
intended
so
that
having
crossed
to
his
own
street
he
approached
the
new
house
from
the
north
and
as
he
came
to
the
corner
of
vertrees
lot
daughter
emerged
from
the
front
door
and
walked
thoughtfully
down
the
path
to
the
old
picket
gate
she
was
unconscious
of
the
approach
of
the
pedestrian
from
the
north
and
did
not
see
him
until
she
had
opened
the
gate
and
he
was
almost
beside
her
then
she
looked
up
and
as
she
saw
him
she
started
visibly
and
if
this
thing
had
happened
to
robert
lamhorn
he
would
have
had
a
thought
far
beyond
the
horizon
of
bibbs
thoughts
lamhorn
indeed
would
have
spoken
his
thought
he
would
have
said
jumped
because
you
were
thinking
of
me
chapter
xv
mary
was
the
picture
of
a
lady
flustered
she
stood
with
one
hand
closing
the
gate
behind
her
and
she
had
turned
to
go
in
the
direction
bibbs
was
walking
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
for
it
but
that
they
should
walk
together
at
least
as
far
as
the
new
house
but
bibbs
had
paused
in
his
slow
stride
and
there
elapsed
an
instant
before
either
spoke
or
moved
it
was
no
longer
than
that
and
yet
it
sufficed
for
each
to
seem
to
say
by
look
and
attitude
it
you
then
they
both
spoke
at
once
each
hurriedly
pronouncing
the
name
as
if
about
to
deliver
a
message
of
importance
then
both
came
to
a
stop
simultaneously
but
bibbs
made
a
heroic
effort
and
as
they
began
to
walk
on
together
he
contrived
to
find
his
voice
i
hate
a
frozen
fish
myself
he
said
think
three
miles
was
too
long
for
you
to
put
up
with
gracious
she
cried
turning
to
him
a
glowing
face
from
which
restraint
and
embarrassment
had
suddenly
fled
sheridan
lovely
to
put
it
that
way
but
it
always
the
girl
place
to
say
turning
cooler
i
ought
to
have
been
the
one
to
show
that
we
did
know
each
other
well
enough
not
to
say
something
it
was
an
imposition
for
me
to
have
made
you
bring
me
home
and
after
i
went
into
the
house
i
decided
i
should
have
walked
besides
it
was
three
miles
to
the
i
never
thought
of
it
said
bibbs
earnestly
did
either
i
might
have
said
something
if
i
thought
of
anything
i
talking
now
though
i
must
remember
that
and
not
worry
about
it
later
i
think
i
talking
though
it
does
sound
intelligent
even
to
me
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
i
ever
met
you
again
i
turn
on
my
voice
and
keep
it
going
no
mater
what
it
said
i
she
interrupted
him
with
laughter
and
mary
vertrees
laugh
was
one
which
bibbs
father
had
declared
after
the
cripple
would
crawl
five
miles
to
and
at
the
merry
lilting
of
it
father
son
took
heart
to
forget
some
of
his
trepidation
be
any
kind
of
idiot
he
said
you
laugh
at
me
some
more
it
wo
be
difficult
for
she
did
and
bibbs
cheeks
showed
a
little
actual
color
which
mary
perceived
it
recalled
to
her
by
contrast
her
careless
and
irritated
description
of
him
to
her
mother
just
after
she
had
seen
him
for
the
first
time
tragic
and
altogether
it
seemed
to
her
now
that
she
must
have
been
blind
they
had
passed
the
new
house
without
either
of
them
showing
or
possessing
any
consciousness
that
it
had
been
the
destination
of
one
of
them
keep
on
talking
bibbs
continued
cheerfully
you
keep
on
laughing
i
amounting
to
something
in
the
world
this
afternoon
making
a
noise
and
that
makes
you
make
music
do
be
bothered
by
my
bleating
out
such
things
as
that
i
really
frightened
and
that
makes
me
bleat
anything
i
frightened
about
two
things
i
afraid
of
what
i
think
of
myself
later
if
i
do
keep
talking
talking
now
i
mean
and
i
afraid
of
what
i
think
of
myself
if
i
do
and
besides
these
two
things
i
frightened
anyhow
i
do
remember
talking
as
much
as
this
more
than
once
or
twice
in
my
life
i
suppose
it
was
always
in
me
to
do
it
though
the
first
time
i
met
any
one
who
did
know
me
well
enough
not
to
you
not
really
talking
to
me
said
mary
just
thinking
he
returned
gravely
not
thinking
at
all
i
only
making
vocal
sounds
because
i
believe
it
more
mannerly
i
seem
to
be
the
subject
of
what
little
meaning
they
possess
and
i
like
to
change
it
but
i
do
know
how
i
have
any
experience
in
talking
and
i
know
how
to
manage
need
change
the
subject
on
my
account
sheridan
she
said
even
if
you
really
talked
about
she
turned
her
face
toward
him
as
she
spoke
and
bibbs
caught
his
breath
he
was
pathetically
amazed
by
the
look
she
gave
him
it
was
a
glowing
look
warmly
friendly
and
understanding
and
what
almost
shocked
him
it
was
an
eagerly
interested
look
bibbs
was
not
accustomed
to
anything
like
that
you
i
i
he
stammered
and
the
faint
color
in
his
cheeks
grew
almost
vivid
she
was
still
looking
at
him
and
she
saw
the
strange
radiance
that
came
into
his
face
there
was
something
about
him
too
that
explained
how
many
people
might
think
him
but
he
did
not
seem
to
mary
vertrees
he
seemed
the
most
quaintly
natural
person
she
had
ever
met
he
waited
and
became
coherent
say
something
now
he
said
do
even
belong
in
the
chorus
and
here
i
am
trying
to
sing
the
funny
man
solo
you
she
interrupted
rather
play
your
stop
and
listen
to
it
she
began
but
after
pausing
thoughtfully
she
made
a
gesture
with
her
muff
indicating
a
large
brick
church
which
they
were
approaching
you
see
that
church
sheridan
suppose
i
could
he
answered
in
simple
truthfulness
looking
at
her
i
do
want
to
once
when
i
was
ill
the
nurse
told
me
i
better
say
anything
that
was
on
my
mind
and
i
got
the
habit
the
other
reason
i
do
want
to
see
the
church
is
that
i
have
a
feeling
it
where
you
going
and
where
i
be
sent
she
shook
her
head
in
cheery
negation
unless
you
want
to
be
would
you
like
to
come
with
me
why
yes
he
said
and
again
it
was
apparent
that
he
spoke
in
simple
truthfulness
come
if
you
care
for
organ
music
the
organist
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
sometimes
he
plays
for
me
he
a
dear
old
man
he
had
a
degree
from
bonn
and
was
a
professor
afterward
but
he
gave
up
everything
for
music
that
he
waiting
in
the
doorway
he
looks
like
beethoven
does
he
i
think
he
knows
that
perhaps
and
enjoys
it
a
little
i
hope
said
bibbs
as
they
reached
the
church
steps
think
beethoven
would
like
it
too
it
must
be
pleasant
to
look
like
other
have
kept
you
mary
said
to
the
organist
no
he
answered
heartily
would
not
mind
so
only
you
should
shooer
come
is
sheridan
kraft
he
has
come
to
listen
with
the
organist
looked
bluntly
surprised
that
so
he
exclaimed
i
am
glad
if
you
wish
him
and
if
he
can
stant
my
liddle
playink
he
iss
musician
himself
then
of
said
bibbs
as
the
three
entered
the
church
together
i
played
the
i
tried
to
play
fortunately
he
checked
himself
he
had
been
about
to
offer
the
information
that
he
had
failed
to
master
the
in
his
boyhood
i
not
a
musician
he
contented
himself
with
saying
kraft
surprise
increased
man
you
are
fortunate
i
play
for
miss
vertrees
she
comes
always
alone
you
are
the
first
you
are
the
first
one
ever
they
had
reached
the
head
of
the
central
aisle
and
as
the
organist
finished
speaking
bibbs
stopped
short
turning
to
look
at
mary
vertrees
in
a
dazed
way
that
was
not
of
her
perceiving
for
though
she
stopped
as
he
did
her
gaze
followed
the
organist
who
was
walking
away
from
them
toward
the
front
of
the
church
shaking
his
white
beethovian
mane
roguishly
false
pretenses
on
my
part
bibbs
said
mean
to
be
kind
to
the
sick
but
i
not
an
invalid
any
more
i
so
well
i
going
back
to
work
in
a
few
days
i
better
leave
before
he
begins
to
play
i
said
mary
beginning
to
walk
forward
unless
you
do
like
great
he
followed
her
to
a
seat
about
up
the
aisle
while
kraft
ascended
to
the
organ
it
was
an
enormous
one
the
procession
of
pipes
ranging
from
long
starveling
whistles
to
thundering
fat
guns
they
covered
all
the
rear
wall
of
the
church
and
the
organist
figure
reaching
its
high
perch
looked
like
that
of
some
lilliputian
magician
ludicrously
daring
the
attempt
to
control
a
monster
certain
to
overwhelm
him
afternoon
some
handel
he
turned
to
shout
mary
nodded
you
like
that
she
asked
bibbs
do
know
i
never
heard
any
except
i
do
know
anything
about
music
i
do
even
know
how
to
pretend
i
do
if
i
knew
enough
to
pretend
i
said
mary
looking
at
him
and
smiling
faintly
she
turned
away
as
a
great
sound
began
to
swim
and
tremble
in
the
air
the
huge
empty
space
of
the
church
filled
with
it
and
the
two
people
listening
filled
with
it
the
universe
seemed
to
fill
and
thrill
with
it
the
two
sat
intensely
still
the
great
sound
all
round
about
them
while
the
church
grew
dusky
and
only
the
organist
lamp
made
a
tiny
star
of
light
his
white
head
moved
from
side
to
side
beneath
it
rhythmically
or
lunged
and
recovered
with
the
fierceness
of
a
duelist
thrusting
but
he
was
magnificently
the
master
of
his
giant
and
it
sang
to
his
magic
as
he
bade
it
bibbs
was
swept
away
upon
that
mighty
singing
such
a
thing
was
wholly
unknown
to
him
there
had
been
no
music
in
his
meager
life
unlike
the
tale
it
was
the
princess
bedrulbudour
who
had
brought
him
to
the
enchanted
cave
and
that
for
bibbs
was
what
made
its
magic
dazing
it
seemed
to
him
a
long
long
time
since
he
had
been
walking
home
drearily
from
gurney
office
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
set
out
upon
a
happy
journey
since
then
and
that
he
had
reached
another
planet
where
mary
vertrees
and
he
sat
alone
together
listening
to
a
vast
choiring
of
invisible
soldiers
and
holy
angels
there
were
armies
of
voices
about
them
singing
praise
and
thanksgiving
and
yet
they
were
alone
it
was
incredible
that
the
walls
of
the
church
were
not
the
boundaries
of
the
universe
to
remain
so
for
ever
incredible
that
there
was
a
smoky
street
just
yonder
where
housemaids
were
bringing
in
evening
papers
from
front
steps
and
where
children
were
taking
their
last
spins
on
before
being
haled
indoors
for
dinner
he
had
a
curious
sense
of
communication
with
his
new
friend
he
knew
it
could
not
be
so
and
yet
he
felt
as
if
all
the
time
he
spoke
to
her
saying
hear
this
strain
you
hear
that
strain
you
know
the
dream
that
these
sounds
bring
to
me
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
she
answered
continually
hear
i
hear
that
strain
and
i
hear
the
new
one
that
you
are
hearing
now
i
know
the
dream
that
these
sounds
bring
to
you
yes
yes
i
hear
it
all
we
hear
together
and
though
the
church
grew
so
dim
that
all
was
mysterious
shadow
except
the
vague
planes
of
the
windows
and
the
organist
light
with
the
white
head
moving
beneath
it
bibbs
had
no
consciousness
that
the
girl
sitting
beside
him
had
grown
shadowy
he
seemed
to
see
her
as
plainly
as
ever
in
the
darkness
though
he
did
not
look
at
her
and
all
the
mighty
chanting
of
the
organ
multitudinous
voices
that
afternoon
seemed
to
bibbs
to
be
chorusing
of
her
and
interpreting
her
singing
her
thoughts
and
singing
for
him
the
world
of
humble
gratitude
that
was
in
his
heart
because
she
was
so
kind
to
him
it
all
meant
mary
chapter
xvi
but
when
she
asked
him
what
it
meant
on
their
homeward
way
he
was
silent
they
had
come
a
few
paces
from
the
church
without
speaking
walking
slowly
tell
you
what
it
meant
to
me
she
said
as
he
did
not
immediately
reply
any
music
of
handel
always
means
one
thing
above
all
others
to
me
courage
that
it
it
makes
cowardice
of
whining
seem
so
infinitesimal
it
makes
most
things
in
our
hustling
little
lives
seem
he
said
seems
odd
does
it
that
people
are
hurrying
to
trains
and
hanging
to
straps
in
weltering
every
way
to
get
home
and
feed
and
sleep
so
they
can
get
and
yet
there
is
anything
down
there
worth
getting
to
they
like
servants
drudging
to
keep
the
house
going
and
believing
the
drudgery
itself
is
the
great
thing
they
make
so
much
noise
and
fuss
and
dirt
they
forget
that
the
house
was
meant
to
live
in
the
housework
has
to
be
done
but
the
people
who
do
it
have
been
so
overpaid
that
they
confused
and
worship
the
housework
they
overpaid
and
yet
poor
things
they
have
anything
that
a
chicken
ca
have
of
course
when
the
world
gets
to
paying
its
wages
sensibly
that
will
be
you
mean
she
asked
and
she
made
their
slow
pace
a
little
slower
they
had
only
three
blocks
to
go
the
word
is
i
only
mean
that
things
do
look
very
sensible
now
especially
to
a
man
that
wants
to
keep
out
of
and
ca
well
at
least
any
sport
would
say
it
fair
for
all
the
strong
runners
to
start
from
the
same
mark
and
give
the
weak
ones
a
fair
distance
ahead
so
that
all
can
run
something
like
even
on
the
stretch
and
would
it
be
pleasant
really
if
they
could
all
cross
the
together
who
really
enjoys
beating
anybody
if
he
sees
the
beaten
man
face
the
only
way
we
can
enjoy
getting
ahead
of
other
people
nowadays
is
by
forgetting
what
the
other
people
feel
and
that
he
added
nothing
of
what
the
music
meant
to
me
you
see
if
i
keep
talking
about
what
it
did
mean
i
can
keep
from
telling
you
what
it
did
it
mean
courage
to
you
too
a
little
she
asked
and
praise
were
in
it
and
somehow
those
things
mean
courage
to
they
were
all
there
bibbs
said
do
know
the
name
of
what
he
played
but
i
should
think
it
would
matter
much
the
man
that
makes
the
music
must
leave
it
to
you
what
it
can
mean
to
you
and
the
name
he
puts
to
it
ca
make
much
difference
except
to
himself
and
people
very
much
like
him
i
suppose
that
true
though
i
never
thought
of
it
like
imagine
music
must
make
feelings
and
paint
pictures
in
the
minds
of
the
people
who
hear
it
bibbs
went
on
musingly
to
their
own
natures
as
much
as
according
to
the
music
itself
the
musician
might
compose
something
and
play
it
wanting
you
to
think
of
the
holy
grail
and
some
people
who
heard
it
would
think
of
a
and
some
would
think
of
how
good
they
were
themselves
and
a
boy
might
think
of
himself
at
the
head
of
a
solemn
procession
carrying
a
banner
and
riding
a
white
horse
and
then
if
there
were
some
jubilant
passages
in
the
music
he
think
of
a
they
had
reached
her
gate
and
she
set
her
hand
upon
it
but
did
not
open
it
bibbs
felt
that
this
was
almost
the
kindest
of
her
kindnesses
not
to
be
prompt
in
leaving
him
all
she
said
did
tell
me
whether
you
liked
i
did
need
that
true
and
i
did
need
to
ask
i
knew
but
you
said
you
were
trying
to
keep
from
telling
me
what
it
did
ca
keep
from
telling
it
any
longer
he
said
music
meant
to
me
it
meant
the
kindness
of
of
how
thought
i
was
a
sort
of
lonely
tramp
and
sick
she
said
decidedly
thought
perhaps
you
like
to
hear
kraft
play
and
you
curious
sometimes
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
you
who
were
mary
laughed
i
strum
piano
a
little
chopin
grieg
chaminade
you
would
listen
bibbs
drew
a
deep
breath
frightened
again
he
said
in
an
unsteady
voice
afraid
you
think
i
pushing
but
he
paused
and
the
words
sank
to
a
murmur
if
you
want
me
to
play
for
you
she
said
gladly
it
will
be
merely
absurd
after
what
you
heard
this
afternoon
i
play
like
a
hundred
thousand
other
girls
and
i
like
it
i
glad
when
any
one
willing
to
listen
and
if
you
she
stopped
checked
by
a
sudden
recollection
and
laughed
ruefully
my
piano
wo
be
here
after
i
sending
it
away
i
afraid
that
if
you
like
me
to
play
to
you
you
have
to
come
this
let
me
he
cried
if
you
care
i
could
play
he
said
wistfully
i
could
play
like
that
old
man
in
the
church
i
could
thank
but
you
have
heard
me
play
i
know
you
liked
this
afternoon
but
said
bibbs
was
the
greatest
happiness
i
ever
it
was
too
dark
to
see
his
face
but
his
voice
held
such
plain
honesty
and
he
spoke
with
such
complete
unconsciousness
of
saying
anything
especially
significant
that
she
knew
it
was
the
truth
for
a
moment
she
was
nonplussed
then
she
opened
the
gate
and
went
in
come
after
dinner
then
he
said
not
moving
you
mind
if
i
stood
here
until
time
to
come
in
she
had
reached
the
steps
and
at
that
she
turned
offering
him
the
response
of
laughter
and
a
gay
gesture
of
her
muff
toward
the
lighted
windows
of
the
new
house
as
though
bidding
him
to
run
home
to
his
dinner
that
night
bibbs
sat
writing
in
his
music
can
come
into
a
blank
life
and
fill
it
everything
that
is
beautiful
is
music
if
you
can
listen
there
is
no
gracefulness
like
that
of
a
graceful
woman
at
a
grand
piano
there
is
a
swimming
loveliness
of
line
that
seems
to
merge
with
the
running
of
the
sound
and
you
seem
as
you
watch
her
to
see
what
you
are
hearing
and
to
hear
what
you
are
seeing
there
are
women
who
make
you
think
of
pine
woods
coming
down
to
a
sparkling
sea
the
air
about
such
a
woman
is
bracing
and
when
she
is
near
you
you
feel
strong
and
ambitious
you
forget
that
the
world
does
like
you
you
think
that
perhaps
you
are
a
great
fellow
after
all
then
you
come
away
and
feel
like
a
boy
who
has
fallen
in
love
with
his
teacher
you
be
whipped
for
it
and
ought
to
be
there
are
women
who
make
you
think
of
diana
crowned
with
the
moon
but
they
do
not
have
the
i
do
not
believe
helen
of
troy
had
a
they
would
not
have
fought
about
her
if
her
nose
had
been
quite
that
long
the
greek
nose
is
not
the
adorable
nose
the
adorable
nose
is
about
an
eighth
of
an
inch
shorter
much
of
the
music
of
wagner
it
appears
is
not
suitable
to
the
piano
wagner
was
a
composer
who
could
interpret
into
music
such
things
as
the
primitive
impulses
of
humanity
he
could
have
made
a
into
music
but
not
if
he
had
to
work
in
it
wagner
was
always
dealing
in
immensities
a
would
have
put
a
majestic
lump
in
so
grand
a
gizzard
as
that
there
is
a
mystery
about
pianos
it
seems
sometimes
they
have
to
be
that
is
how
some
people
speak
of
the
penitentiary
is
a
euphuism
for
to
but
pianos
are
not
sent
to
prison
and
they
are
not
sent
to
the
tuner
the
tuner
is
sent
to
them
why
are
pianos
and
where
sometimes
a
glorious
day
shines
into
the
most
ordinary
and
useless
life
happiness
and
beauty
come
caroling
out
of
the
air
into
the
gloomy
house
of
that
life
as
if
some
stray
angel
just
happened
to
perch
on
the
resting
and
singing
and
the
night
after
such
a
day
is
lustrous
and
splendid
with
the
memory
of
it
music
and
beauty
and
kindness
those
are
the
three
greatest
things
god
can
give
us
to
bring
them
all
in
one
day
to
one
who
expected
nothing
ah
the
heart
that
received
them
should
be
as
humble
as
it
is
thankful
but
it
is
hard
to
be
humble
when
one
is
so
rich
with
new
memories
it
is
impossible
to
be
humble
after
a
day
of
glory
yes
the
adorable
nose
is
more
than
an
eighth
of
an
inch
shorter
than
the
greek
nose
it
is
a
full
quarter
of
an
inch
shorter
there
are
women
who
will
be
kinder
to
a
sick
tramp
than
to
a
conquering
hero
but
the
sick
tramp
had
better
remember
what
he
is
take
care
take
care
humble
the
word
chapter
xvii
that
about
which
troubled
bibbs
had
been
a
mystery
to
vertrees
and
it
was
being
explained
to
him
at
about
the
time
bibbs
scribbled
the
reference
to
it
in
his
notes
mary
had
gone
upon
bibbs
departure
at
ten
and
and
vertrees
sat
until
after
midnight
in
the
library
talking
and
in
all
that
time
they
found
not
one
cheerful
topic
but
became
more
depressed
with
everything
and
with
every
phase
of
everything
that
they
discussed
no
extraordinary
state
of
affairs
in
a
family
which
has
always
up
its
head
only
to
arrive
in
the
end
at
a
point
where
all
it
can
do
is
to
look
on
helplessly
at
the
processes
of
its
own
financial
dissolution
for
that
was
the
point
which
this
despairing
couple
had
reached
they
could
do
nothing
except
look
on
and
talk
about
it
they
were
only
vaporing
and
they
knew
it
need
to
have
done
that
about
her
piano
vapored
vertrees
could
have
managed
somehow
without
it
at
least
she
ought
to
have
consulted
me
and
if
she
insisted
i
could
have
arranged
the
details
with
the
the
thought
that
it
might
be
annoying
for
you
vertrees
explained
she
planned
for
you
not
to
know
about
it
until
they
had
removed
until
after
that
is
but
i
decided
to
to
mention
it
you
see
she
did
even
tell
me
about
it
until
this
morning
she
has
another
idea
too
i
afraid
it
it
he
urged
as
she
found
it
difficult
to
go
on
other
idea
is
that
is
it
was
i
think
it
can
be
avoided
of
course
it
was
about
her
he
exclaimed
quickly
wo
have
it
you
must
see
to
that
rather
not
talk
to
her
about
it
but
you
must
let
try
not
his
wife
promised
course
they
very
the
more
reason
for
her
to
keep
them
he
returned
irritably
not
that
far
gone
i
think
not
yet
vertrees
said
seems
to
be
troubled
about
the
the
coal
matter
and
about
tilly
of
course
the
piano
will
take
care
of
some
things
like
those
for
a
while
and
do
like
it
i
gave
her
the
piano
to
play
on
not
to
must
be
distressed
about
it
in
one
way
she
said
comfortingly
arranged
with
the
with
the
purchaser
that
the
men
will
come
for
it
about
half
after
five
in
the
afternoon
the
days
are
so
short
now
really
quite
yes
he
agreed
moodily
far
as
that
goes
people
have
a
right
to
move
a
piece
of
furniture
without
stirring
up
the
neighbors
i
suppose
even
by
daylight
i
do
suppose
our
neighbors
are
paying
much
attention
just
now
though
i
hear
sheridan
was
back
in
his
office
early
the
morning
after
the
vertrees
made
a
little
sound
of
commiseration
do
believe
that
was
because
he
was
suffering
though
i
sure
it
was
only
because
he
felt
his
business
was
so
important
mary
told
me
he
seemed
wrapped
up
in
his
son
succeeding
and
that
was
what
he
bragged
about
most
he
is
vulgar
in
his
boasting
i
understand
he
does
talk
a
great
deal
about
his
his
actual
money
though
there
was
something
about
blades
of
grass
that
i
did
comprehend
i
think
he
meant
something
about
his
energy
but
perhaps
not
no
his
bragging
usually
seemed
to
be
not
so
much
a
personal
vainglory
as
about
his
family
and
the
greatness
of
this
of
this
city
vertrees
echoed
with
dull
bitterness
nothing
but
a
i
suppose
it
looks
to
the
man
who
has
the
luck
to
make
it
work
for
him
i
suppose
it
looks
to
any
young
man
too
starting
out
to
make
his
fortune
out
of
it
the
fellows
that
get
what
they
want
out
of
it
say
it
and
everybody
else
gets
the
habit
but
you
have
a
different
point
of
view
if
it
the
city
that
got
what
it
wanted
out
of
you
of
course
sheridan
says
vertrees
seemed
unaware
of
this
unusual
outburst
believe
she
began
timidly
does
boast
of
that
is
i
understand
he
has
never
seemed
so
interested
in
the
the
other
her
husband
face
was
dark
but
at
that
a
heavier
shadow
fell
upon
it
he
looked
more
haggard
than
before
other
one
he
repeated
averting
his
eyes
mean
you
mean
the
third
son
the
one
that
was
here
this
evening
the
the
youngest
she
returned
her
voice
so
feeble
it
was
almost
a
whisper
and
then
neither
of
them
spoke
for
several
long
minutes
nor
did
either
look
at
the
other
during
that
silence
at
last
vertrees
contrived
to
cough
but
not
convincingly
ah
what
was
it
mary
said
about
him
out
in
the
hall
when
she
came
in
this
afternoon
i
heard
you
asking
her
something
about
him
but
she
answered
in
such
a
low
voice
i
did
ah
happen
to
catch
she
did
say
much
all
she
said
was
this
i
asked
her
if
she
had
enjoyed
her
walk
with
him
and
she
said
the
most
wistful
creature
i
ever
known
was
all
he
is
and
so
fragile
though
he
seem
quite
so
much
so
lately
i
was
watching
mary
from
the
window
when
she
went
out
and
he
joined
her
and
if
i
had
known
about
him
i
have
thought
he
had
quite
an
interesting
you
known
about
him
known
what
nothing
of
course
she
said
hurriedly
definite
that
is
mary
said
decidely
long
ago
that
he
not
at
all
insane
as
we
thought
at
first
it
only
well
of
course
it
is
odd
their
attitude
about
him
i
suppose
it
some
nervous
trouble
that
makes
him
perhaps
a
little
queer
at
times
so
that
he
ca
apply
himself
to
anything
or
perhaps
does
odd
things
but
after
all
of
course
we
only
have
an
impression
about
it
we
do
know
that
is
positively
i
she
paused
then
went
on
did
know
just
how
to
ask
that
is
i
mention
it
to
mary
i
did
i
the
poor
lady
floundered
pitifully
concluding
with
a
mumble
soon
after
after
the
the
do
think
i
caught
more
than
a
glimpse
of
him
said
vertrees
would
know
him
if
i
saw
him
but
your
impression
of
him
is
he
broke
off
suddenly
springing
to
his
feet
in
agitation
ca
imagine
her
oh
no
he
gasped
and
he
began
to
pace
the
floor
epileptic
no
she
cried
may
be
all
right
we
it
horrible
i
ca
he
threw
himself
back
into
his
chair
again
sweeping
his
hands
across
his
face
then
letting
them
fall
limply
at
his
sides
vertrees
was
tremulous
must
give
way
so
she
said
inspired
for
once
almost
to
direct
discourse
mary
might
think
of
doing
it
would
be
on
her
own
account
it
would
be
on
ours
but
if
we
should
should
consider
it
that
would
be
on
our
own
account
it
is
because
we
think
of
god
no
he
groaned
for
us
we
can
go
to
the
poorhouse
but
mary
ca
be
a
stenographer
sighing
vertrees
resumed
her
obliqueness
course
she
murmured
all
seems
very
premature
speculating
about
such
things
but
i
had
a
queer
sort
of
feeling
that
she
seemed
quite
interested
in
this
she
had
almost
said
this
one
but
checked
herself
this
young
man
it
natural
of
course
she
is
always
so
strong
and
well
and
he
is
he
seems
to
be
that
is
rather
appealing
to
the
the
he
agreed
bitterly
the
sympathies
she
faltered
you
might
feel
easier
if
i
could
have
a
little
talk
with
some
one
whom
had
thought
of
not
going
about
it
too
brusquely
of
course
but
perhaps
just
waiting
for
his
name
to
be
mentioned
if
i
happened
to
be
talking
with
somebody
that
knew
the
family
and
then
i
might
find
a
chance
to
say
that
i
was
sorry
to
hear
he
been
ill
so
much
and
something
of
that
kind
perhaps
do
know
anybody
that
knows
the
that
is
well
in
a
way
of
course
one
of
the
family
that
roscoe
sheridan
is
not
a
that
is
she
rather
a
little
woman
i
think
and
of
course
rather
ordinary
i
think
she
is
interested
about
that
is
of
course
she
be
anxious
to
be
more
intimate
with
mary
naturally
she
always
looking
over
here
from
her
house
she
was
looking
out
the
window
this
afternoon
when
mary
went
out
i
noticed
though
i
do
think
mary
saw
her
i
sure
she
would
think
it
out
of
place
to
to
be
frank
about
matters
she
called
the
other
day
and
mary
must
rather
like
her
she
said
that
evening
that
the
call
had
done
her
good
do
you
think
it
might
be
wise
i
do
know
i
feel
the
whole
matter
is
so
do
i
she
returned
promptly
is
really
a
thing
we
should
be
considering
seriously
of
course
still
should
say
not
but
possibly
thus
they
skirmished
up
and
down
the
field
but
before
they
turned
the
lights
out
and
went
it
was
thoroughly
understood
between
them
that
vertrees
should
seek
the
earliest
opportunity
to
obtain
definite
information
from
sibyl
sheridan
concerning
the
mental
and
physical
status
of
bibbs
and
if
he
were
subject
to
attacks
of
lunacy
the
unhappy
pair
decided
to
prevent
the
sacrifice
they
supposed
their
daughter
intended
to
make
of
herself
altogether
if
there
were
spiteful
ghosts
in
the
old
house
that
night
eavesdropping
upon
the
woeful
comedy
they
must
have
died
anew
of
laughter
vertrees
opportunity
occurred
the
very
next
afternoon
darkness
had
fallen
and
the
had
come
they
were
carrying
the
piano
down
the
front
steps
and
vertrees
was
standing
in
the
open
doorway
behind
them
preparing
to
withdraw
when
she
heard
a
sharp
exclamation
and
roscoe
sheridan
bareheaded
emerged
from
the
shadow
into
the
light
of
the
doorway
gracious
she
cried
did
give
me
a
fright
sheridan
is
it
vertrees
was
perplexed
by
this
informal
appearance
but
she
reflected
that
it
might
be
providential
you
come
in
oh
no
thank
you
sibyl
panted
pressing
her
hand
to
her
side
do
know
what
a
fright
you
given
me
and
it
was
nothing
but
your
piano
she
laughed
shrilly
know
since
our
tragedy
coming
so
suddenly
the
other
day
you
have
no
idea
how
upset
i
been
almost
hysterical
and
i
just
glanced
out
of
the
window
a
minute
or
so
ago
and
saw
your
door
wide
open
and
black
figures
of
men
against
the
light
carrying
something
heavy
and
i
almost
fainted
you
see
it
was
just
the
way
it
looked
when
i
saw
them
bringing
my
poor
in
next
door
only
such
a
few
short
days
ago
and
i
thought
i
seen
your
daughter
start
for
a
drive
with
bibbs
sheridan
in
a
car
about
three
and
they
are
back
yet
are
they
good
heavens
the
only
thing
i
could
think
of
was
that
something
must
have
happened
to
them
and
i
just
dashed
over
and
it
was
only
your
piano
she
broke
into
laughter
again
suppose
you
just
sending
it
somewhere
to
be
repaired
are
you
it
being
taken
said
vertrees
you
come
in
and
make
me
a
little
visit
i
was
so
sorry
the
other
day
that
i
was
ah
she
stopped
inconsequently
then
repeated
her
invitation
you
come
in
i
really
you
but
i
must
be
running
back
my
husband
usually
gets
home
about
this
time
and
i
make
a
little
point
of
it
always
to
be
very
vertrees
descended
the
steps
and
walked
toward
the
street
with
sibyl
quite
balmy
for
so
late
in
november
it
almost
like
a
may
afraid
miss
vertrees
will
miss
her
piano
said
sibyl
watching
the
instrument
disappear
into
the
big
van
at
the
curb
plays
wonderfully
kittersby
tells
she
plays
very
well
one
of
your
relatives
came
to
hear
her
yesterday
after
dinner
and
i
think
she
played
all
evening
for
mean
bibbs
asked
sibyl
the
youngest
sheridan
yes
he
very
musical
is
he
never
heard
of
it
but
i
should
think
it
would
matter
much
whether
he
was
or
not
if
he
could
get
miss
vertrees
to
play
to
him
does
your
daughter
expect
the
piano
back
soon
i
believe
not
immediately
sheridan
came
last
evening
to
hear
her
play
because
she
had
arranged
with
the
that
is
it
was
to
be
removed
this
afternoon
he
seems
almost
well
sibyl
nodded
father
going
to
try
to
start
him
to
seems
very
delicate
said
vertrees
should
think
he
would
be
able
to
stand
a
great
deal
either
physically
or
she
paused
and
then
added
glowing
with
the
sense
of
her
own
adroitness
mentally
bibbs
is
all
right
said
sibyl
in
an
odd
voice
vertrees
asked
breathlessly
has
he
always
been
this
question
came
with
the
same
anxious
eagerness
he
had
a
long
siege
of
nervous
dyspepsia
but
he
over
you
think
is
all
right
you
need
wor
sibyl
choked
and
pressed
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
night
vertrees
she
said
hurriedly
as
the
of
an
automobile
swung
round
the
corner
above
sending
a
brightening
glare
toward
the
edge
of
the
pavement
where
the
two
ladies
were
standing
you
come
in
urged
vertrees
cordially
hearing
the
sound
of
a
cheerful
voice
out
of
the
darkness
beyond
the
approaching
glare
there
mary
now
and
she
but
sibyl
was
across
the
street
thanks
she
called
hope
she
wo
miss
her
piano
and
she
ran
into
her
own
house
and
plunged
headlong
upon
a
leather
divan
in
the
hall
holding
her
handkerchief
over
her
mouth
the
noise
of
her
tumultuous
entrance
was
evidently
startling
in
the
quiet
house
for
upon
the
bang
of
the
door
there
followed
the
crash
of
a
decanter
dropped
upon
the
floor
of
the
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
after
a
rumble
of
indistinct
profanity
roscoe
came
forth
holding
a
dripping
napkin
in
his
hand
your
excitement
he
demanded
do
you
find
to
go
into
hysterics
over
another
death
in
the
family
it
funny
she
gasped
old
people
i
guess
they
getting
their
lying
prone
she
elevated
her
feet
in
the
air
clapped
her
heels
together
repeatedly
in
an
ecstasy
through
come
through
said
her
husband
crossly
you
been
up
to
she
cried
dropping
her
feet
and
swinging
around
to
face
him
it
them
those
vertreeses
she
wiped
her
eyes
had
to
sell
their
piano
what
of
it
kittersby
told
me
all
about
a
week
ago
said
sibyl
been
hard
up
for
a
long
time
and
she
says
as
long
ago
as
last
winter
she
knew
that
girl
got
a
pair
of
and
patched
because
she
got
it
done
the
same
place
kittersby
cook
had
hers
and
the
night
of
the
i
kind
of
got
suspicious
myself
she
did
have
one
single
piece
of
any
kind
of
real
jewelry
and
you
could
see
her
dress
was
an
old
one
done
over
men
ca
tell
those
things
and
you
all
made
a
big
fuss
over
her
but
i
thought
she
looked
a
sight
myself
of
course
edith
was
crazy
to
have
her
and
well
he
urged
impatiently
i
telling
you
kittersby
says
they
have
got
a
thing
just
absolutely
nothing
and
they
do
know
anywhere
to
turn
the
family
all
died
out
but
them
and
all
the
relatives
they
got
are
very
distant
and
live
east
and
scarcely
know
she
says
the
whole
been
wondering
what
would
become
of
the
girl
had
plenty
chances
to
marry
up
to
a
year
or
so
ago
but
she
was
so
indifferent
she
scared
the
men
off
and
the
ones
that
had
wanted
to
went
and
married
other
girls
gracious
they
were
lucky
marry
her
the
man
that
found
himself
tied
up
to
that
girl
funny
terrible
funny
said
roscoe
with
sarcasm
so
funny
i
broke
a
decanter
and
spilled
a
quart
of
she
begged
see
i
was
sitting
by
the
window
a
little
while
ago
and
i
saw
a
big
wagon
drive
up
across
the
street
and
some
men
go
into
the
house
it
was
too
dark
to
make
out
much
and
for
a
minute
i
got
the
idea
they
were
moving
out
the
house
has
been
foreclosed
on
kittersby
says
it
seemed
funny
too
because
i
knew
that
girl
was
out
riding
with
bibbs
well
i
thought
i
see
so
i
slipped
over
and
it
was
their
piano
they
sold
it
and
were
trying
to
sneak
it
out
after
dark
so
nobody
catch
on
again
she
gave
way
to
her
enjoyment
but
resumed
as
her
husband
seemed
about
to
interrupt
the
narrative
a
minute
ca
you
the
old
lady
was
superintending
and
she
gave
it
all
away
i
sized
her
up
for
one
of
those
old
churchy
people
that
tell
all
kinds
of
lies
except
when
it
comes
to
so
many
words
and
then
they
ca
she
might
just
as
well
told
me
outright
yes
they
sold
it
and
i
hope
they
pay
some
of
their
debts
they
owe
everybody
and
last
week
a
made
an
awful
fuss
at
the
door
with
vertrees
their
cook
told
our
upstairs
girl
and
she
said
she
did
know
when
she
seen
any
money
herself
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
case
as
that
girl
in
your
life
girl
their
cook
vertrees
girl
do
you
see
they
looked
on
our
coming
up
into
this
neighborhood
as
their
last
chance
they
were
just
going
down
and
out
and
here
bobs
up
the
green
rich
sheridan
family
so
they
doll
the
girl
up
in
her
old
things
made
over
and
send
her
out
to
get
a
sheridan
she
got
to
get
one
and
she
just
goes
in
blind
and
she
tries
it
on
first
with
you
you
remember
she
just
plain
told
you
she
was
going
to
mash
you
and
then
she
found
out
you
were
the
married
one
and
turned
right
square
around
to
jim
and
carried
him
off
his
feet
oh
jim
was
landed
there
no
doubt
about
that
but
jim
was
lucky
he
did
live
to
stay
landed
and
it
a
good
thing
for
him
mirth
had
vanished
and
she
spoke
with
virulent
rapidity
she
could
get
you
because
you
were
married
and
she
could
get
jim
because
jim
died
and
there
they
were
dead
broke
do
you
know
what
she
did
do
you
know
what
she
doing
i
do
said
roscoe
gruffly
sibyl
voice
rose
and
culminated
in
a
scream
of
renewed
hilarity
she
waited
in
the
and
drove
home
with
him
from
funeral
never
spoke
to
him
before
jim
was
cold
she
rocked
herself
back
and
forth
upon
the
divan
she
shrieked
roscoe
think
of
it
bibbs
he
stared
unsympathetically
but
her
mirth
was
unabated
for
all
that
yesterday
she
continued
between
paroxysms
she
came
out
of
the
house
just
as
he
was
passing
she
must
have
been
looking
out
waiting
for
the
chance
i
saw
the
old
lady
watching
at
the
window
and
she
got
him
there
last
night
to
to
him
the
old
lady
gave
that
away
and
she
made
him
take
her
out
in
a
machine
and
the
cream
of
it
is
that
they
did
even
know
whether
he
was
insane
or
not
they
thought
maybe
he
was
but
she
went
after
him
just
the
same
the
old
lady
set
herself
to
pump
me
about
it
bibbs
oh
my
lord
bibbs
but
roscoe
looked
grim
it
funny
to
you
is
it
it
sounds
kind
of
pitiful
to
me
i
should
think
it
would
to
a
woman
it
might
she
returned
sobering
might
if
those
people
were
such
smart
alecks
if
they
had
the
decency
to
come
down
off
the
perch
a
little
i
probably
would
think
it
was
funny
but
to
see
sit
up
on
their
pedestal
all
the
time
they
eating
dirt
well
i
think
it
funny
that
girl
sits
up
as
if
she
was
queen
elizabeth
and
expects
people
to
wallow
on
the
ground
before
her
until
they
get
near
enough
for
her
to
give
a
good
kick
with
her
old
patched
shoes
oh
she
do
that
all
right
and
then
she
powders
up
and
goes
out
to
mash
bibbs
sheridan
here
said
roscoe
heavily
do
care
about
that
one
way
or
another
if
you
through
i
got
something
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
i
was
going
to
that
day
just
before
we
heard
about
at
this
sibyl
stiffened
quickly
her
eyes
became
intensely
bright
is
it
he
began
frowning
i
was
going
to
say
then
he
broke
off
and
becoming
conscious
that
he
was
still
holding
the
wet
napkin
in
his
hand
threw
it
pettishly
into
a
corner
never
expected
i
have
to
say
anything
like
this
to
anybody
i
married
but
i
was
going
to
ask
you
what
was
the
matter
between
you
and
sibyl
uttered
a
sharp
monosyllable
felt
the
time
had
come
for
me
to
know
about
it
he
went
on
never
told
me
anything
never
asked
she
interposed
curtly
we
got
in
a
way
of
not
talking
much
said
roscoe
looks
to
me
now
as
if
we
pretty
much
lost
the
run
of
each
other
the
way
a
good
many
people
do
i
do
say
it
was
my
fault
i
was
up
early
and
down
to
work
all
day
and
i
come
home
tired
at
night
and
want
to
go
to
bed
soon
as
i
got
the
paper
read
unless
there
was
some
good
musical
show
in
town
well
you
seemed
all
right
until
here
lately
the
last
month
or
so
i
began
to
see
something
was
wrong
i
could
help
seeing
she
said
like
changed
you
did
look
the
same
you
were
all
strung
up
and
excited
and
fidgety
you
got
to
looking
peakid
and
run
down
now
then
lamhorn
had
been
going
with
us
a
good
while
but
i
noticed
that
not
long
ago
you
got
to
picking
on
him
about
every
little
thing
he
did
you
got
to
quarreling
with
him
when
i
was
there
and
when
i
was
i
could
see
you
been
quarreling
whenever
i
came
in
and
he
was
you
object
to
that
asked
sibyl
breathing
quickly
when
it
injures
my
wife
health
he
returned
with
a
quick
lift
of
his
eyes
to
hers
began
to
run
down
just
about
the
time
you
began
falling
out
with
he
stepped
close
to
her
here
sibyl
i
going
to
know
what
it
you
are
she
snapped
trembling
he
said
gravely
i
angry
enough
to
do
more
than
tremble
you
find
go
on
was
all
i
was
going
to
say
the
other
day
he
said
was
going
to
ask
you
that
was
all
you
were
going
to
say
the
other
day
yes
what
else
have
you
to
say
he
replied
with
grim
swiftness
want
to
know
why
you
keep
telephoning
him
you
want
to
see
him
since
he
stopped
coming
she
made
a
long
low
sound
of
comprehension
before
she
said
what
else
did
edith
want
you
to
ask
me
want
to
know
what
you
say
over
the
telephone
to
lamhorn
he
said
fiercely
that
all
edith
told
you
to
ask
me
you
saw
her
when
you
stopped
in
there
on
your
way
home
this
evening
did
you
did
she
tell
you
then
what
i
said
over
the
telephone
to
lamhorn
she
did
he
vociferated
his
voice
growing
louder
said
tell
your
wife
to
stop
telephoning
robert
lamhorn
to
come
and
see
her
because
he
is
going
to
do
it
that
what
she
said
and
i
want
to
know
what
it
means
i
intend
a
maid
appeared
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
is
ready
she
said
and
giving
the
troubled
pair
one
glance
went
demurely
into
the
roscoe
disregarded
the
interruption
intend
to
know
exactly
what
has
been
going
on
he
declared
mean
to
know
just
what
sibyl
jumped
up
almost
touching
him
standing
face
to
face
with
him
you
do
she
cried
shrilly
mean
to
know
just
what
what
do
you
you
listen
to
your
sister
insinuating
ugly
things
about
your
wife
and
then
you
come
home
making
a
scene
before
the
servants
and
humiliating
me
in
their
presence
do
you
suppose
that
irish
girl
hear
every
word
you
said
you
go
in
there
and
eat
your
dinner
alone
go
on
go
and
eat
your
dinner
alone
because
i
wo
eat
with
you
and
she
broke
away
from
the
detaining
grasp
he
sought
to
fasten
upon
her
and
dashed
up
the
stairway
panting
he
heard
the
door
of
her
room
slam
overhead
and
the
sharp
click
of
the
key
in
the
lock
chapter
xviii
at
seven
on
the
last
morning
of
that
month
sheridan
passing
through
the
upper
hall
on
his
way
to
descend
the
stairs
for
breakfast
found
a
couple
of
scribbled
sheets
of
lying
on
the
floor
a
window
had
been
open
in
bibbs
room
the
evening
before
he
had
left
his
on
the
sill
and
the
sheets
were
loose
the
door
was
open
and
when
bibbs
came
in
and
closed
it
he
did
not
notice
that
the
two
sheets
had
blown
out
into
the
hall
sheridan
recognized
the
handwriting
and
put
the
sheets
in
his
coat
pocket
intending
to
give
them
to
george
or
jackson
for
return
to
the
owner
but
he
forgot
and
carried
them
with
him
at
noon
he
found
himself
alone
in
his
office
and
having
a
little
leisure
remembered
the
bits
of
manuscript
took
them
out
and
glanced
at
them
a
glance
was
enough
to
reveal
that
they
were
not
epistolary
sheridan
would
not
have
read
a
that
came
into
his
possession
in
that
way
though
in
a
of
he
might
have
felt
it
his
duty
to
take
advantage
of
an
opportunity
afforded
in
any
manner
whatsoever
having
satisfied
himself
that
scribblings
were
only
a
sample
of
the
kind
of
writing
his
son
preferred
to
the
he
decided
innocently
enough
that
he
would
be
justified
in
reading
them
it
appears
that
a
lady
will
nod
pleasantly
upon
some
windy
generalization
of
a
companion
and
will
wear
the
most
agreeable
expression
of
accepting
it
as
the
law
and
then
days
afterward
when
the
thing
is
a
mummy
to
its
promulgator
she
will
inquire
out
of
a
clear
sky
did
you
say
that
the
people
have
nothing
in
life
that
a
chicken
has
what
did
you
mean
and
she
may
say
it
in
a
manner
that
makes
a
sensible
reply
very
difficult
you
will
be
so
full
of
wonder
that
she
remembered
so
seriously
yet
what
does
the
rooster
lack
he
has
food
and
shelter
he
is
warm
in
winter
his
wives
raise
not
one
fine
family
for
him
but
dozens
he
has
a
clear
sky
over
him
he
breathes
sweet
air
he
walks
in
his
april
orchard
under
a
roof
of
flowers
he
must
die
violently
perhaps
but
quickly
is
midas
cancer
a
better
way
the
rooster
wives
and
children
must
die
are
those
of
midas
immortal
his
life
is
shorter
than
the
life
of
midas
but
life
is
only
a
sixth
as
long
as
that
of
the
galapagos
tortoise
the
worthy
takes
his
vacation
so
that
he
may
refresh
himself
anew
for
the
hard
work
of
getting
nothing
that
the
rooster
does
get
the
has
an
elevator
the
rooster
flies
up
to
the
bough
midas
has
a
machine
to
take
him
to
his
work
the
rooster
finds
his
worm
underfoot
the
feels
a
pressure
sometimes
without
knowing
why
and
sits
late
at
wine
after
the
day
labor
next
morning
he
curses
his
head
because
it
interferes
with
the
work
he
swears
never
to
relieve
that
pressure
again
the
rooster
has
no
pressure
and
no
wine
this
difference
is
in
his
favor
the
rooster
is
a
dependent
he
depends
upon
the
farmer
and
the
weather
midas
is
a
dependent
he
depends
upon
the
farmer
and
the
weather
the
rooster
thinks
only
of
the
moment
midas
provides
for
what
does
he
provide
for
nothing
that
the
rooster
will
not
have
without
providing
the
rooster
and
the
prosperous
worker
they
are
born
they
grub
they
love
they
grub
and
love
grubbing
they
grub
and
they
die
neither
knows
beauty
neither
knows
knowledge
and
after
all
when
midas
dies
and
the
rooster
dies
there
is
one
thing
midas
has
had
and
rooster
has
not
midas
has
had
the
excitement
of
accumulating
what
he
has
grubbed
and
that
has
been
his
life
and
his
love
and
his
god
he
can
not
take
that
god
with
him
when
he
dies
i
wonder
if
the
worthy
gods
are
those
we
can
take
with
us
midas
must
teach
all
to
be
as
midas
the
young
must
be
raised
in
his
religion
the
manuscript
ended
there
and
sheridan
was
not
anxious
for
more
he
crumpled
the
sheets
into
a
ball
depositing
it
with
vigor
in
a
beside
him
then
rising
he
consulted
a
cyclopedia
of
names
which
a
had
somehow
sold
to
him
years
before
a
volume
now
first
put
to
use
for
the
location
of
having
read
the
legend
sheridan
walked
up
and
down
the
spacious
office
exhaling
the
breath
of
contempt
fool
he
mumbled
but
this
was
no
new
thought
nor
was
the
contrariness
of
bibbs
notes
a
surpise
to
him
and
presently
he
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
he
felt
very
lonely
and
this
was
daily
his
hardest
hour
for
a
long
time
he
and
jim
had
lunched
together
habitually
roscoe
preferred
a
club
luncheon
but
jim
and
his
father
almost
always
went
to
a
small
restaurant
near
the
sheridan
building
where
they
spent
twenty
minutes
in
the
consumption
of
food
and
twenty
in
talk
with
cigars
jim
came
for
his
father
every
day
at
five
minutes
after
twelve
and
sheridan
was
again
in
his
office
at
five
minutes
before
one
but
now
that
jim
no
longer
came
sheridan
remained
alone
in
his
office
he
had
not
gone
out
to
lunch
since
jim
death
nor
did
he
have
anything
sent
to
him
he
fasted
until
evening
it
was
the
time
he
missed
jim
personally
the
most
the
voice
and
eyes
and
handshake
all
brisk
and
alert
all
but
these
things
were
not
the
keenest
in
sheridan
grief
his
sense
of
loss
went
far
deeper
roscoe
was
dependable
a
steady
old
and
that
was
a
great
comfort
but
it
was
in
jim
that
sheridan
had
most
happily
perceived
his
own
likeness
jim
was
the
one
who
would
have
been
surest
to
keep
the
great
property
growing
greater
year
by
year
sheridan
had
fallen
asleep
night
after
night
picturing
what
the
growth
would
be
under
jim
he
had
believed
that
jim
was
absolutely
certain
to
be
one
of
the
biggest
men
in
the
country
well
it
was
all
up
to
roscoe
now
that
reminded
him
of
a
question
he
had
in
mind
to
ask
roscoe
it
was
a
question
sheridan
considered
of
no
present
importance
but
his
wife
had
suggested
it
though
vaguely
and
he
had
meant
to
speak
to
roscoe
about
it
however
roscoe
had
not
come
into
his
father
office
for
several
days
and
when
sheridan
had
seen
his
son
at
home
there
had
been
no
opportunity
he
waited
until
the
greater
part
of
his
day
work
was
over
toward
four
and
then
went
down
to
roscoe
office
which
was
on
a
lower
floor
he
found
several
men
waiting
for
business
interviews
in
an
outer
room
of
the
series
roscoe
occupied
and
he
supposed
that
he
would
find
his
son
busy
with
others
and
that
his
question
would
have
to
be
postponed
but
when
he
entered
the
door
marked
sheridan
private
roscoe
was
there
alone
he
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
door
his
feet
on
a
and
he
did
not
turn
as
his
father
opened
the
door
pretty
good
men
out
there
waitin
to
see
you
my
boy
said
sheridan
the
matter
roscoe
answered
indistinctly
not
moving
i
guess
that
all
right
too
i
let
wait
sometimes
myself
i
just
wanted
to
ask
you
a
question
but
i
expect
it
keep
if
workin
something
out
in
your
mind
roscoe
made
no
reply
and
his
father
who
had
turned
to
the
door
paused
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
staring
curiously
at
the
motionless
figure
in
the
chair
usually
the
son
seemed
pleased
and
eager
when
he
came
to
the
office
all
right
ai
you
said
sheridan
sick
are
you
sheridan
was
puzzled
then
abruptly
he
decided
to
ask
his
question
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
that
young
lamhorn
he
said
guess
your
mother
thinks
he
comin
to
see
edith
pretty
often
and
you
known
him
any
of
us
so
wo
said
roscoe
thickly
wo
say
a
dam
thing
about
him
sheridan
uttered
an
exclamation
and
walked
quickly
to
a
position
near
the
window
where
he
could
see
his
son
face
roscoe
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
vacuous
his
hair
was
disordered
his
mouth
was
distorted
and
he
was
deathly
pale
the
father
stood
aghast
george
he
muttered
name
said
roscoe
help
blank
astonishment
was
sheridan
first
sensation
probably
nothing
in
the
world
could
have
more
amazed
his
than
to
find
roscoe
the
steady
old
in
this
condition
you
get
this
way
he
demanded
caught
cold
and
took
too
much
for
it
for
reply
roscoe
laughed
hoarsely
cold
i
been
drinkun
all
time
lately
firs
you
notice
it
george
cried
sheridan
thought
i
smelt
it
on
you
a
good
deal
lately
but
i
would
believed
you
take
more
was
good
for
you
boh
to
see
you
like
a
common
hog
roscoe
chuckled
and
threw
out
his
right
arm
in
a
meaningless
gesture
he
repeated
chuckling
a
hog
said
sheridan
angrily
business
hours
i
do
object
to
anybody
takin
a
drink
if
you
wants
to
out
o
business
hours
nor
if
a
man
keeps
his
work
right
up
to
the
scratch
i
would
be
the
one
to
baste
him
if
he
got
good
an
drunk
once
in
two
three
years
maybe
it
ai
my
way
i
let
it
alone
but
i
never
believed
in
forcin
my
way
on
a
son
in
moral
matters
i
guess
i
was
wrong
you
think
them

drunkard

think
you
can

i
wonder
how
often
this
has
been
happening
and
me
not
on
to
it
i
have
a
look
over
your
books
and
i
roscoe
stumbled
to
his
feet
laughing
wildly
and
stood
swaying
contriving
to
hold
himself
in
position
by
clutching
the
back
of
the
heavy
chair
in
which
he
had
been
sitting
hoorah
he
cried
my
principles

sheridan
had
seized
the
telephone
upon
roscoe
desk
and
was
calling

own
office
overhead

sheridan
picked
up
a
newspaper
from
roscoe
desk
and
sat
down
with
his
back
to
his
son
affecting
to
read
roscoe
seemed
to
be
unaware
of
his
father
significant
posture
know
wh
i
think
he
went
on
think
bibbs
only
one
the
any

all

i
ask
you
fine
young
business
man
look
whass
happen
to
me
fine
he
lifted
his
hand
from
the
sustaining
chair
in
a
deplorable
gesture
and
immediately
losing
his
balance
fell
across
the
chair
and
caromed
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
remaining
prostrate
for
several
minutes
during
which
sheridan
did
not
relax
his
apparent
attention
to
the
newspaper
he
did
not
even
look
round
at
the
sound
of
roscoe
fall
roscoe
slowly
climbed
to
an
upright
position
pulling
himself
up
by
holding
to
the
chair
he
was
slightly
sobered
outwardly
having
progressed
in
the
prostrate
interval
to
a
state
of
befuddlement
less
volatile
he
rubbed
his
dazed
eyes
with
the
back
of
his
left
hand
what
you
ask
me
while
ago
he
said
you
did
what
what
was
it
you
better
sit
ask
me
what
i
thought
about
lamhorn
you
did
ask
me
that
well
i
wo
tell
you
i
wo
say
dam
word
him
the
tinkled
sheridan
placed
the
receiver
to
his
ear
and
said
then
he
got
roscoe
coat
and
hat
from
a
closet
and
brought
them
to
his
son
into
this
coat
he
said
ri
roscoe
murmured
obediently
they
went
out
into
the
main
hall
by
a
side
door
not
passing
through
the
outer
office
and
sheridan
waited
for
an
empty
elevator
stopped
it
and
told
the
operator
to
take
on
no
more
passengers
until
they
reached
the
ground
floor
roscoe
walked
out
of
the
building
and
got
into
the
automobile
without
lurching
and
twenty
minutes
later
walked
into
his
own
house
in
the
same
manner
neither
he
nor
his
father
having
spoken
a
word
in
the
interval
sheridan
did
not
go
in
with
him
he
went
home
and
to
his
own
room
without
meeting
any
of
his
family
but
as
he
passed
bibbs
door
he
heard
from
within
the
sound
of
a
cheerful
young
voice
humming
jubilant
fragments
of
song
who
looks
a
mustang
in
the
eye
with
a
leap
from
the
ground
to
the
saddle
in
a
bound
and
away
and
away
it
was
the
first
time
in
sheridan
life
that
he
had
ever
detected
any
musical
symptom
whatever
in
bibbs
he
had
never
even
heard
him
whistle
and
it
seemed
the
last
touch
of
irony
that
the
useless
fool
should
be
merry
to
sheridan
it
was
tom
o
bedlam
singing
while
the
house
burned
and
he
did
not
tarry
to
enjoy
the
melody
but
went
into
his
own
room
and
locked
the
door
chapter
xix
he
emerged
only
upon
a
second
summons
to
dinner
two
hours
later
and
came
to
the
table
so
white
and
silent
that
his
wife
made
her
anxiety
manifest
and
was
but
partially
reassured
by
his
explanation
that
his
lunch
had
with
him
a
little
presently
however
he
spoke
effectively
bibbs
whose
appetite
had
become
hearty
was
helping
himself
to
a
second
breast
of
capon
from
salver
another
difference
between
midas
and
chicken
sheridan
remarked
grimly
can
eat
rooster
but
rooster
ca
eat
midas
i
reckon
you
overlooked
that
midas
looks
to
me
like
he
had
the
advantage
bibbs
retained
enough
presence
of
mind
to
transfer
the
capon
breast
to
his
plate
without
dropping
it
and
to
respond
he
crows
over
having
returned
his
antagonists
fire
in
this
fashion
he
blushed
for
he
could
blush
distinctly
now
and
his
mother
looked
upon
him
with
pleasure
though
the
reference
to
midas
and
roosters
was
of
course
jargon
to
her
you
ever
see
anybody
improve
the
way
that
child
has
she
exclaimed
declare
bibbs
sometimes
lately
you
look
right
handsome
got
to
be
such
a
gadabout
edith
giggled
found
something
of
his
on
the
floor
this
morning
before
anybody
was
up
said
sheridan
reckon
if
people
lose
things
in
this
house
and
expect
to
get
back
they
better
get
up
as
soon
as
i
was
it
he
lost
asked
edith
knows
her
father
returned
to
me
like
i
forgot
to
bring
it
home
with
me
i
looked
it
over
thought
probably
it
was
something
pretty
important
belongin
to
a
busy
man
like
he
affected
to
search
his
pockets
did
i
do
with
it
now
oh
yes
seems
to
me
like
i
remember
leavin
it
down
at
the
office
in
the
place
for
it
bibbs
murmured
still
red
sheridan
gave
him
a
grin
pretty
soon
you
be
gettin
up
early
enough
to
find
things
before
i
do
it
was
a
threat
and
bibbs
repeated
the
substance
of
it
later
in
the
evening
to
mary
vertrees
they
had
come
to
know
each
other
that
well
time
here
at
last
he
said
as
they
sat
together
in
the
melancholy
of
the
room
which
had
been
denuded
of
its
piano
that
removal
had
left
an
emptiness
so
distressing
to
and
vertrees
that
neither
of
them
had
crossed
the
threshold
since
the
dark
day
but
the
though
from
a
single
jet
shed
no
melancholy
upon
bibbs
nor
could
any
room
seem
bare
that
knew
the
glowing
presence
of
mary
he
spoke
lightly
not
sadly
it
come
i
shirked
and
put
off
but
i
ca
shirk
and
put
off
any
longer
it
really
my
part
to
go
to
him
at
least
it
would
save
my
face
he
means
what
he
says
and
the
time
come
to
serve
my
sentence
hard
labor
for
life
i
mary
shook
her
head
do
think
so
he
too
think
my
father
kind
and
bibbs
stared
at
her
i
sure
of
it
i
felt
that
he
has
a
great
brave
heart
only
that
he
has
to
be
kind
in
his
own
way
because
he
ca
understand
any
other
yes
said
bibbs
that
what
you
mean
by
she
looked
at
him
gravely
earnest
concern
in
her
friendly
eyes
going
to
be
pretty
hard
for
you
is
it
he
returned
smiling
has
been
just
the
last
flicker
of
revolt
nobody
minds
work
if
he
likes
the
kind
of
work
there
be
no
loafers
in
the
world
if
each
man
found
the
thing
that
he
could
do
best
but
the
only
work
i
happen
to
want
to
do
is
useless
so
i
have
to
give
it
up
i
be
a
is
it
like
exactly
get
up
at
six
he
said
have
a
to
carry
with
me
which
is
aristocratic
and
no
advantage
the
other
workmen
have
tin
buckets
and
tin
buckets
are
better
i
leave
the
house
at
and
i
at
work
in
my
overalls
at
seven
i
have
an
hour
off
at
noon
and
work
again
from
one
till
the
work
itself
was
muscularly
exhausting
not
at
all
they
could
give
me
a
heavier
job
because
i
was
good
what
will
you
do
i
want
to
i
left
said
bibbs
was
what
they
call
over
there
a
in
one
of
the
departments
and
what
i
be
sent
back
what
is
it
she
insisted
bibbs
explained
very
simple
and
very
easy
i
feed
long
strips
of
zinc
into
a
pair
of
steel
jaws
and
the
jaws
bite
the
zinc
into
little
circles
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
see
that
the
strip
goes
into
the
jaws
at
a
certain
angle
and
yet
i
was
a
very
bad
hand
at
he
had
kept
his
voice
cheerful
as
he
spoke
but
he
had
grown
a
shade
paler
and
there
was
a
latent
anguish
deep
in
his
eyes
he
may
have
known
it
and
wished
her
not
to
see
it
for
he
turned
away
do
that
all
day
long
she
asked
and
as
he
nodded
seems
incredible
she
exclaimed
feeding
a
strip
of
zinc
into
a
machine
nine
hours
a
day
no
wonder
she
broke
off
and
then
after
a
keen
glance
at
his
face
she
said
should
think
you
would
have
been
a
hand
at
it
he
laughed
ruefully
think
it
the
noise
though
i
ashamed
to
say
it
you
see
it
a
very
powerful
machine
and
there
a
sort
of
rhythmical
crashing
a
crash
every
time
the
jaws
bite
off
a
often
is
that
thing
should
make
about
disks
a
minute
a
little
more
than
one
a
you
close
to
it
the
workman
has
to
sit
in
its
lap
he
said
turning
to
her
more
gaily
others
do
mind
you
see
it
something
wrong
with
me
i
have
an
idiotic
way
of
flinching
from
the
confounded
thing
i
flinch
and
duck
a
little
every
time
the
crash
comes
and
i
could
get
over
it
i
was
a
treat
to
the
other
workmen
in
that
room
they
be
glad
to
see
me
back
they
used
to
laugh
at
me
all
day
mary
gaze
was
averted
from
bibbs
now
she
sat
with
her
elbow
resting
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
her
lifted
hand
pressed
against
her
cheek
she
was
staring
at
the
wall
and
her
eyes
had
a
burning
brightness
in
them
does
seem
possible
any
one
could
do
that
to
you
she
said
in
a
low
voice
he
not
kind
he
ought
to
be
proud
to
help
you
to
the
leisure
to
write
books
it
should
be
his
greatest
privilege
to
have
them
published
for
you
you
see
him
bibbs
interrupted
a
faint
ripple
of
hilarity
in
his
voice
he
could
understand
what
you
saying
and
if
you
can
imagine
his
taking
such
a
notion
he
have
had
bloss
put
up
posters
all
over
the
country
sheridan
read
the
poet
with
a
punch
no
it
just
as
well
he
never
got
the
but
what
the
use
never
written
anything
worth
printing
and
i
never
could
she
said
because
you
never
seen
the
poor
little
things
i
tried
to
would
let
me
but
i
know
you
could
ah
it
a
pity
is
said
bibbs
honestly
never
could
but
you
the
kindest
lady
in
this
world
miss
she
gave
him
a
flashing
glance
and
it
was
as
kind
as
he
said
she
was
sounds
wrong
she
said
impulsively
mean
vertrees
i
thought
of
you
by
your
first
name
ever
since
i
met
you
you
rather
call
me
bibbs
was
dazzled
he
drew
a
long
deep
breath
and
did
not
speak
you
she
asked
without
a
trace
of
coquetry
i
can
he
said
in
a
low
voice
that
very
pretty
she
laughed
such
an
honest
person
it
pleasant
to
have
you
gallant
sometimes
by
way
of
she
became
grave
again
immediately
hear
myself
laughing
as
if
it
were
some
one
else
it
sounds
like
laughter
on
the
eve
of
a
great
she
got
up
restlessly
crossed
the
room
and
leaned
against
the
wall
facing
him
got
to
go
back
to
that
place
he
nodded
the
other
time
you
did
it
over
it
said
bibbs
years
but
i
do
mind
the
prospect
of
a
repetition
so
much
as
much
as
what
she
prompted
as
he
stopped
bibbs
looked
up
at
her
shyly
want
to
say
it
but
but
i
come
to
a
dead
balk
when
i
try
i
on
say
it
whatever
it
is
she
bade
him
would
know
how
to
say
anything
i
should
doubt
if
you
either
like
or
dislike
what
i
want
to
say
he
returned
moving
uncomfortably
in
his
chair
and
looking
at
his
feet
he
seemed
to
feel
awkward
thoroughly
see
all
my
life
until
i
met
you
if
i
ever
felt
like
saying
anything
i
wrote
it
instead
saying
things
is
a
new
trick
for
me
and
this
well
it
just
this
i
used
to
feel
as
if
i
had
ever
had
any
sort
of
a
life
at
all
i
never
been
of
use
to
anything
or
anybody
and
i
never
had
anything
myself
except
a
kind
of
haphazard
thinking
but
now
it
different
i
still
of
no
use
to
anybody
and
i
do
see
any
prospect
of
being
useful
but
i
have
had
something
for
myself
i
had
a
beautiful
and
happy
experience
and
it
makes
my
life
seem
to
be
i
mean
i
glad
i
lived
it
that
all
it
your
letting
me
be
near
you
sometimes
as
you
have
this
strange
beautiful
happy
little
while
he
did
not
once
look
up
and
reached
silence
at
the
end
of
what
he
had
to
say
with
his
eyes
still
awkwardly
regarding
his
feet
she
did
not
speak
but
a
soft
rustling
of
her
garments
let
him
know
that
she
had
gone
back
to
her
chair
again
the
house
was
still
the
shabby
old
room
was
so
quiet
that
the
sound
of
a
creaking
in
the
wall
seemed
sharp
and
loud
and
yet
when
mary
spoke
at
last
her
voice
was
barely
audible
you
think
it
has
been
happy
to
be
friends
with
me
you
want
to
to
make
it
said
bibbs
as
faintly
want
to
go
on
being
my
friend
as
long
as
we
live
would
you
he
gulped
you
make
that
kind
of
speech
to
me
because
you
think
it
he
tried
to
evade
her
a
ca
come
in
his
overalls
she
interrupted
with
a
sudden
sharpness
said
what
you
did
because
you
think
the
shop
going
to
kill
no
you
do
think
that
she
rose
to
her
feet
again
and
came
and
stood
before
him
you
think
it
going
to
send
you
back
to
the
sanitarium
do
deny
it
bibbs
there
see
how
easily
i
call
you
that
you
see
a
friend
or
i
could
do
it
well
if
you
meant
what
you
said
and
you
did
mean
it
i
know
it
you
not
going
to
go
back
to
the
sanitarium
the
shop
hurt
you
it
and
now
bibbs
looked
up
she
stood
before
him
straight
and
tall
splendid
in
generous
strength
her
eyes
shining
and
wet
i
mean
that
much
to
you
she
cried
ca
harm
you
go
back
to
the
shop
but
come
to
me
when
your
day
work
is
done
let
the
machines
crash
their
times
a
minute
but
remember
each
crash
that
deafens
you
is
that
much
nearer
the
evening
and
me
he
stumbled
to
his
feet
say
he
gasped
evening
dear
bibbs
he
could
only
stare
bewildered
evening
i
want
you
they
hurt
you
again
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
it
was
strong
and
warm
in
his
tremulous
clasp
i
could
i
go
and
feed
the
strips
of
zinc
to
the
machine
with
you
she
said
all
day
long
i
send
my
thoughts
to
you
you
must
keep
remembering
that
your
friend
stands
beside
you
and
when
the
work
is
done
wo
the
night
make
up
for
the
day
light
seemed
to
glow
from
her
he
was
blinded
by
that
radiance
of
kindness
but
all
he
could
say
was
huskily
think
there
with
me
standing
beside
the
old
and
they
laughed
and
looked
at
each
other
and
at
last
bibbs
found
what
it
meant
not
to
be
alone
in
the
world
he
had
a
friend
chapter
xx
when
he
came
into
the
new
house
a
few
minutes
later
he
found
his
father
sitting
alone
by
the
library
fire
bibbs
went
in
and
stood
before
him
cured
father
he
said
do
i
go
back
to
the
shop
the
desolate
and
grim
old
man
did
not
relax
was
sittin
up
to
give
you
a
last
chance
to
say
something
like
that
i
reckon
it
about
time
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
you
have
manhood
enough
not
to
make
me
take
you
over
there
by
the
collar
last
night
i
made
up
my
mind
i
give
you
just
one
more
day
well
you
got
to
it
before
i
did
pretty
close
to
the
eleventh
hour
all
right
start
in
it
the
first
o
the
month
think
you
can
get
up
in
time
bibbs
responded
briskly
i
want
to
tell
you
going
in
a
spirit
as
you
said
i
go
and
i
it
your
lookout
his
father
grunted
put
you
back
on
the
you
get
nine
dollars
a
than
i
worth
too
said
bibbs
cheerily
reminds
me
i
did
mean
you
by
in
that
nonsense
i
been
writing
i
meant
a
hell
of
a
lot
o
difference
what
you
meant
just
wanted
you
to
know
good
night
the
sound
of
the
young
man
footsteps
ascending
the
stairs
became
inaudible
and
the
house
was
quiet
but
presently
as
sheridan
sat
staring
angrily
at
the
fire
the
shuffling
of
a
pair
of
slippers
could
be
heard
descending
and
sheridan
made
her
appearance
her
oblique
expression
and
the
state
of
her
toilette
being
those
of
a
person
who
after
trying
unsuccessfully
to
sleep
on
one
side
has
got
up
to
look
for
burglars
she
exclaimed
drowsily
you
go
to
bed
it
must
be
goin
on
she
yawned
and
seated
herself
near
him
stretching
out
her
hands
to
the
fire
the
matter
she
asked
sleep
and
anxiety
striving
sluggishly
with
each
other
in
her
voice
knew
you
were
worried
all
you
got
something
new
on
your
mind
besides
jim
taken
away
like
he
was
what
worryin
you
now
papa
she
jeered
feebly
tell
me
that
you
sat
up
to
see
bibbs
you
starts
in
at
the
shop
again
morning
said
sheridan
the
same
as
he
did
before
how
long
you
goin
to
keep
him
at
it
papa
she
asked
timidly
he
knows
something
the
unhappy
man
struck
his
palms
together
then
got
to
his
feet
and
began
to
pace
the
room
as
was
his
wont
when
he
talked
go
back
to
the
machine
he
could
learn
to
tend
properly
in
the
six
months
he
was
there
and
he
stick
to
it
till
he
does
learn
it
do
you
suppose
that
lummix
ever
asked
himself
why
i
want
him
to
learn
it
no
and
i
ai
to
tell
him
either
when
he
went
there
i
had
set
him
on
the
simplest
machine
we
got
and
he
stuck
there
how
much
prospect
would
there
be
of
his
learnin
to
run
the
whole
business
if
he
ca
run
the
easiest
machine
in
it
i
sent
him
there
to
make
him
thorough
and
what
happened
he
did
like
it
that
whole
life
there
been
a
settin
up
o
something
mulish
that
against
everything
i
want
him
to
do
i
do
know
what
it
is
but
it
got
to
be
worked
out
of
him
now
labor
ai
any
more
a
simple
question
than
what
it
was
when
we
were
young
my
idea
is
that
outside
o
union
troubles
the
man
that
can
manage
is
the
man
that
been
one
himself
well
i
set
bibbs
to
learn
the
men
and
to
learn
the
business
and
he
set
himself
to
balk
on
the
first
job
that
what
he
did
and
the
lasted
close
on
to
three
years
if
he
balks
again
i
just
done
with
him
sometimes
i
feel
like
i
was
pretty
near
done
with
everything
anyhow
knew
there
was
something
else
said
sheridan
blinking
over
a
yawn
better
let
it
go
till
and
get
to
bed
now
you
tell
me
something
happened
to
roscoe
he
said
what
i
have
to
look
forward
to
then
what
could
i
depend
on
to
hold
things
together
a
lummix
a
lummix
that
has
learned
how
to
push
a
strip
o
zinc
along
a
groove
she
yawned
need
worry
about
roscoe
papa
he
the
strongest
child
we
had
i
never
did
know
anybody
keep
better
health
than
he
does
i
do
believe
he
even
had
a
cold
in
five
years
you
better
go
up
to
bed
something
did
happen
to
him
though
you
do
know
what
it
means
keepin
property
together
these
days

keepin
it
alive

the
way

next
breath

somebody
hollerin
about
great
unrest
you
bet
there

unrest
there

any
man
alive
smart
enough
to
see
what
goin
to
do
to
us
in
the
end
nor
what

set
to
bust
loose
but
it
frothin
and
bubblin
in
the
boiler
this
country

fillin
up
with
it
from
all
over
the
world
for
a
good
many
years
and
the
old
days
are
dead
and
done
with
church
ai
what
it
used
to
be
nothin
what
it
used
to
be
everything
turned
up
from
the
bottom
and
the
growth
is
so
big
the
roots
stick
out
in
the
air
an
awful
ruction
goin
on
and
you
got
to
keep
hoppin
if

keep
your
balance

the
fellows
that
lay
for
the
chance
to
slide
in
and
sneak
the
benefit
of
it
and
put
their
names
to
it
and
the
use
of
my
havin
ever
been
born
if
such
a
thing
as
that
is
to
happen
what
the
use
of
my
havin
worked
my
life
and
soul
into
my
business
if
it
all
goin
to
be
dispersed
and
scattered
soon
as
i
in
the
ground
he
strode
up
and
down
the
long
room
gesticulating
little
regarding
the
troubled
and
drowsy
figure
by
the
fireside
his
throat
rumbled
thunderously
the
words
came
with
stormy
bitterness
think
this
is
a
time
for
young
men
to
be
lyin
on
beds
of
ease
i
tell
you
there
never
was
such
a
time
before
there
never
was
such
opportunity
the
sluggard
is
despoiled
while
he
sleeps
yes
by
george
if
a
man
lays
down
eat
him
before
he
wakes
but
the
live
man
can
build
straight
up
till
he
touches
the
sky
this
is
the
business
man
day
it
used
to
be
the
soldier
day
and
the
statesman

ours
and
it
ai
a
sunday
to
go
fishin
it
turmoil
turmoil
and
you
got
to
go
out
and
live
it
and
breathe
it
and
make
it
yourself
or
you
only
be
a
dead
man
walkin
around
dreamin
you
alive
and
that
what
my
son
bibbs
has
been
doin
all
his
life
and
what
he
rather

his
part
by
me
and
if
anything
happens
to
roscoe

stop
worryin
over

nonsense
sheridan
interrupted
irritated
into
sharp
wakefulness

moment

to

to
roscoe
and
you
just
tormentin
yourself
about

sheridan
halted
right
mamma
he
said
with
a
vast
sigh

and
he
snapped
off
the
electric
light
leaving
only
the
rosy
glow
of
the
fire
you
speak
to
roscoe
she
yawned
rising
lopsidedly
in
her
drowsiness

on

sheridan
rising
roscoe

suspiciously

bitterly

exclaimed

so
sang
bibbs
his
musical
gaieties
inaudible
to
his
because
of
the
noise
of
the
machinery
he
had
discovered
long
ago
that
the
uproar
was
rhythmical
and
it
had
been
intolerable
but
now
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
day
of
his
return
he
was
accompanying
the
swing
and
clash
of
the
metals
with
jubilant
vaquero
fragments
mingling
improvisations
of
his
own
among
them
and
mocking
the
crash
with

and

behold
with

leap
from

the
long
room
was
ceaselessly
thundering
with
metallic
sound
the
air
was
thick
with
the
smell
of
oil
the
floor
trembled
perpetually
everything
was
implacably
in
motion
nowhere
was
there
a
rest
for
the
dizzied
eye
the
first
time
he
had
entered
the
place
bibbs
had
become
dizzy
instantly
and
six
months
of
it
had
only
added
increasing
nausea
to
faintness
but
he
felt
neither

i
send
my
thoughts
to
you
you
must
keep
remembering
that
your
friend
stands
beside
he
saw
her
there
beside
him
and
the
greasy
roaring
place
became
suffused
with
radiance
the
poet
was
happy

he
was
still
a
poet
there
and
he

ready

he
was
unaware
of
a
sensation
that
passed
along
the
lines
of
workmen
their
great
master
had
come
among
them
and
they
grinned
to
see
him
standing
with
gurney
behind
the
unconscious
bibbs
sheridan
nodded
to
those
nearest
him
he
had
personal
acquaintance
with
nearly
all
of
them
but
he
kept
his
attention
upon
his
son
bibbs
worked
steadily
never
turning
from
his
machine
now
and
then
he
varied
his
musical
programme
with
remarks
addressed
to
the
on
you
old
chew
it
up
it
good
for
you
if
you

here
a
nice
shiny
the
words
were
indistinguishable
but
sheridan
inclined
his
head
to
gurney
ear
and
shouted
fiercely
to
himself
by
george
gurney
laughed
reassuringly
and
shook
his
head
bibbs
returned
to
song
chang

i
who

and
bo
his
father
grasped
him
by
the

he
shouted

foreman
says

out
the
way
and
let
me
show
you
be
careful
bibbs
warned
him
stepping
to
one
side
boh
sheridan
seized
a
strip
of
zinc
from
the
box
you
talkin
to
yourself
about
tryin
to
make
yourself
think
you
so
abused
you
goin
wrong
in
the
head
no
shouted
bibbs
was
singing
because
i
it
i
told
you
i
come
back
and
it
sheridan
may
not
have
understood
at
all
events
he
made
no
reply
but
began
to
run
the
strip
of
zinc
through
the
machine
he
did
it
awkwardly
and
with
bad
results
he
shouted
is
the
way
watch
how
i
do
it
there
to
it
if
you
put
your
mind
on
by
his
own
showing
then
his
mind
was
not
upon
it
he
continued
to
talk
you
got
to
look
out
for
is
to
keep
it
pressed
over
to
run
your
hand
up
with
it
bibbs
vociferated
leaning
toward
him
nothin
you
got
to
out
shouted
bibbs
and
gurney
together
and
they
both
sprang
forward
but
sheridan
right
hand
had
followed
the
strip
too
far
and
the
had
bitten
off
the
tips
of
the
first
and
second
fingers
he
swore
vehemently
and
wrung
his
hand
sending
a
shower
of
red
drops
over
himself
and
bibbs
but
gurney
grasped
his
wrist
and
said
sharply
out
of
here
come
over
to
the
lavatory
in
the
office
bibbs
fetch
my
bag
it
in
my
machine
and
when
bibbs
brought
the
bag
to
the
washroom
he
found
the
doctor
still
grasping
sheridan
wrist
holding
the
injured
hand
over
a
basin
sheridan
had
lost
color
and
temper
too
he
glared
over
his
shoulder
at
his
son
as
the
latter
handed
the
bag
to
gurney
go
on
back
to
your
work
he
said
had
worse
snips
than
that
from
a
no
you
have
said
gurney
have
too
sheridan
retorted
angrily
you
go
on
back
to
your
work
there
no
reason
to
stand
around
here
watchin
ole
doc
gurney
tryin
to
keep
himself
awake
workin
on
a
scratch
that
only
needs
a
little
i
slipped
or
it
would
happened
you
get
back
on
your
right
said
bibbs
sheridan
bellowed
as
his
son
was
passing
out
of
the
door
watch
out
when
you
runnin
that
machine
you
hear
what
i
say
i
slipped
or
i
would
got
scratched
but
you
you
liable
to
get
your
whole
hand
cut
off
you
keep
your
eyes
open
and
bibbs
returned
to
the
thoughtfully
half
an
hour
later
gurney
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
beckoned
him
outside
where
conversation
was
possible
sent
him
home
bibbs
have
to
be
careful
of
that
hand
go
get
your
overalls
off
i
take
you
for
a
drive
and
leave
you
at
said
bibbs
to
stick
to
my
job
till
the
whistle
you
do
the
doctor
returned
smothering
a
yawn
wants
me
to
take
you
down
to
my
office
and
give
you
an
overhauling
to
see
how
much
harm
these
four
days
on
the
machine
have
done
you
i
guess
you
folks
have
got
that
old
man
pretty
thoroughly
upset
between
you
up
at
your
house
but
i
do
need
to
go
over
you
i
can
see
with
my
eyes
half
shut
bibbs
interrupted
what
they
say
i
can
see
you
starting
out
at
least
in
good
shape
made
the
difference
like
the
machine
said
bibbs
made
a
friend
of
it
i
serenade
it
and
talk
to
it
and
then
it
talks
back
to
indeed
what
does
it
say
i
want
to
well
the
doctor
stretched
himself
and
stamped
his
foot
repeatedly
come
along
and
take
a
drive
with
me
you
can
take
the
time
off
that
he
allowed
for
the
examination
and
at
all
said
bibbs
going
to
stand
by
my
old
till
five
i
tell
you
i
like
it
i
suppose
that
the
end
of
your
wanting
to
do
know
about
that
bibbs
said
thoughtfully
the
does
interfere
with
my
thinking
at
least
it
better
than
being
in
business
i
sure
of
that
i
do
want
anything
to
change
i
be
content
to
lead
just
the
life
i
leading
now
to
the
end
of
my
do
beat
the
devil
exclaimed
gurney
father
right
when
he
tells
me
you
a
mystery
perhaps
the
almighty
knew
what
he
was
doing
when
he
made
you
but
it
takes
a
lot
of
faith
to
believe
it
well
off
go
on
back
to
your
murdering
old
he
climbed
into
his
car
which
he
operated
himself
but
he
refrained
from
setting
it
immediately
in
motion
i
rubbed
it
in
on
the
old
man
that
you
had
warned
him
not
to
slide
his
hand
along
too
far
and
that
he
got
hurt
because
he
did
pay
attention
to
your
warning
and
because
he
was
trying
to
show
you
how
to
do
something
you
were
already
doing
a
great
deal
better
than
he
could
you
tell
him
i
be
around
to
look
at
it
and
change
the
dressing
morning
but
when
he
paid
the
promised
visit
the
next
morning
he
did
more
than
change
the
dressing
upon
the
damaged
hand
the
injury
was
severe
of
its
kind
and
gurney
spent
a
long
time
over
it
though
sheridan
was
rebellious
and
scornful
being
brought
to
a
degree
of
tractability
only
by
means
of
horrible
threats
and
talk
of
amputation
however
he
appeared
at
the
with
his
hand
supported
in
a
sling
which
he
seemed
to
regard
as
an
indignity
while
the
natural
inquiries
upon
the
subject
evidently
struck
him
as
deliberate
insults
sheridan
having
been
unable
to
contain
her
solicitude
several
times
during
the
day
and
having
been
checked
each
time
in
a
manner
that
blanched
her
cheek
hastened
to
warn
roscoe
and
sibyl
upon
their
arrival
at
five
to
omit
any
reference
to
the
injury
and
to
avoid
even
looking
at
the
sling
if
they
possibly
could
the
sheridans
dined
on
sundays
at
five
sibyl
had
taken
pains
not
to
arrive
either
before
or
after
the
hand
was
precisely
on
the
hour
and
the
members
of
the
family
were
all
seated
at
the
table
within
two
minutes
after
she
and
roscoe
had
entered
the
house
it
was
a
glum
gathering
overhung
with
portents
the
air
seemed
charged
awaiting
any
tiny
ignition
to
explode
and
sheridan
expression
as
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
almost
continually
upon
her
husband
was
that
of
a
person
engaged
in
prayer
edith
was
pale
and
intent
roscoe
looked
ill
sibyl
looked
ill
and
sheridan
looked
both
ill
and
explosive
bibbs
had
more
color
than
any
of
these
and
there
was
a
strange
brightness
like
a
light
upon
his
face
it
was
curious
to
see
anything
so
happy
in
the
tense
gloom
of
that
household
edith
ate
little
but
gazed
nearly
all
the
time
at
her
plate
she
never
once
looked
at
sibyl
though
sibyl
now
and
then
gave
her
a
quick
glance
heavily
charged
and
then
looked
away
roscoe
ate
nothing
and
like
edith
kept
his
eyes
upon
his
plate
and
made
believe
to
occupy
himself
with
the
viands
thereon
loading
his
fork
frequently
but
not
lifting
it
to
his
mouth
he
did
not
once
look
at
his
father
though
his
father
gazed
heavily
at
him
most
of
the
time
and
between
edith
and
sibyl
and
between
roscoe
and
his
father
some
bitter
wireless
communication
seemed
continually
to
be
taking
place
throughout
the
long
silences
prevailing
during
this
enlivening
ceremony
of
sabbath
refection
you
go
to
church
this
morning
bibbs
his
mother
asked
in
the
effort
to
break
up
one
of
those
ghastly
intervals
did
you
say
mother
you
go
to
church
this
morning
think
so
he
answered
as
from
a
roseate
trance
think
so

you
know
yes
yes
i
went
to
church
one
down
the
street
it
was
the
sermon
about
mother
you
hear
me
she
cried
asked
you
what
the
sermon
was
about
he
roused
himself
think
it
was
about
he
frowned
seeming
to
concentrate
his
will
to
recollect
think
it
was
about
something
in
the
george
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
leave
the
room
and
lean
upon
mist
jackson
shoulder
in
the
pantry
do
know
they
was
any
suhmon
he
concluded
having
narrated
the
dialogue
he
know
is
he
was
with
lady
lives
nex
do
george
was
right

go
to
church

by
yourself

sibyl
asked
he
answered
i
did
go
sibyl
gave
the
ejaculation
an
upward
twist
as
of
mocking
inquiry
and
followed
it
by
another
expressive
of
hilarious
comprehension
bibbs
looked
at
her
studiously
but
she
spoke
no
further
and
that
completed
the
conversation
at
the
lugubrious
feast
coffee
came
finally
was
disposed
of
quickly
and
the
party
dispersed
to
other
parts
of
the
house
bibbs
followed
his
father
and
roscoe
into
the
library
but
was
not
well
received
go
and
listen
to
the
phonograph
with
the
sheridan
commanded
bibbs
retreated
you
do
seem
to
be
a
hard
sort
of
man
he
said
however
he
went
obediently
to
the
room
in
which
his
mother
and
his
sister
and
his
had
helplessly
withdrawn
according
to
their
sabbatical
custom
edith
sat
in
a
corner
tapping
her
feet
together
and
looking
at
them
sibyl
sat
in
the
center
of
the
room
examining
a
brooch
which
she
had
detached
from
her
throat
and
sheridan
was
looking
over
a
collection
of
records
consisting
exclusively
of
caruso
and
she
selected
one
of
the
latter
remarking
that
she
thought
it
pretty
and
followed
it
with
one
of
the
former
and
the
same
remark
as
the
second
reached
its
conclusion
george
appeared
in
the
broad
doorway
seeming
to
have
an
errand
there
but
he
did
not
speak
instead
he
favored
edith
with
a
benevolent
smile
and
she
immediately
left
the
room
george
stepping
aside
for
her
to
precede
him
and
then
disappearing
after
her
in
the
hall
with
an
air
of
successful
diplomacy
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
edith
had
given
him
secret
instructions
and
that
it
had
been
his
pride
and
pleasure
to
fulfil
them
to
the
letter
sibyl
stiffened
in
her
chair
her
lips
parted
and
she
watched
with
curious
eyes
the
vanishing
back
of
the
white
jacket
that
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
but
sharply
another
right
pretty
record
said
sheridan
affecting
with
patent
nervousness
not
to
hear
and
she
unloosed
the
music
sibyl
bit
her
lip
and
began
to
tap
her
chin
with
the
brooch
after
a
little
while
she
turned
to
bibbs
who
reposed
at
in
a
gold
chair
with
his
eyes
closed
did
edith
go
she
asked
curiously
he
repeated
opening
his
eyes
blankly
she
gone
sibyl
got
up
and
stood
in
the
doorway
she
leaned
against
the
casing
still
tapping
her
chin
with
the
brooch
her
eyes
were
dilating
she
was
suddenly
at
high
tension
and
her
expression
had
become
one
of
sharp
excitement
she
listened
intently
when
the
record
was
spun
out
she
could
hear
sheridan
rumbling
in
the
library
during
the
ensuing
silence
and
roscoe
voice
querulous
and
husky
wo
say
anything
at
all
i
tell
you
you
might
just
as
well
let
me
alone
but
there
were
other
sounds
a
rustling
and
murmur
whispering
low
protesting
cadences
in
a
male
voice
and
as
sheridan
started
another
record
a
sudden
vital
resolve
leaped
like
fire
in
the
eyes
of
sibyl
she
walked
down
the
hall
and
straight
into
the
lamhorn
and
edith
both
sprang
to
their
feet
separating
edith
became
instantly
deathly
white
with
a
rage
that
set
her
shaking
from
head
to
foot
and
lamhorn
stuttered
as
he
tried
to
speak
but
edith
shaking
was
not
so
violent
as
sibyl
nor
was
her
face
so
white
at
sight
of
them
and
of
their
embrace
all
possible
consequences
became
nothing
to
sibyl
she
courtesied
holding
up
her
skirts
and
contorting
her
lips
to
the
semblance
of
a
smile
just
as
you
were
both
of
you
she
said
and
then
to
edith
you
tell
my
husband
i
had
been
telephoning
to
lamhorn
march
out
of
here
said
edith
fiercely
straight
out
of
here
sibyl
leveled
a
forefinger
at
lamhorn
you
tell
her
i
been
telephoning
you
i
wanted
you
to
come
good
god
lamhorn
said
knew
she
tell
my
husband
did
you
she
cried
knew
that
he
begged
was
a
manly
thing
to
do
oh
it
was
like
a
gentleman
you
come
you
would
even
come
for
five
minutes
to
hear
what
i
had
to
say
you
were
tired
of
what
i
had
to
say
you
heard
it
all
a
thousand
times
before
and
you
would
come
no
no
no
she
stormed
even
come
for
five
minutes
but
you
could
tell
that
little
cat
and
she
told
my
husband
you
a
man
edith
saw
in
a
flash
that
the
consequences
of
battle
would
be
ruinous
to
sibyl
and
the
furious
girl
needed
no
further
temptation
to
give
way
to
her
feelings
out
of
this
house
she
shrieked
is
my
father
house
do
you
dare
speak
to
robert
like
that
no
i
must
speak
you
dare
edith
and
sibyl
began
to
scream
insults
at
each
other
simultaneously
fronting
each
other
their
furious
faces
close
their
voices
shrilled
and
rose
and
cracked
they
screeched
they
could
be
heard
over
the
noise
of
the
phonograph
which
was
playing
a
selection
they
could
be
heard
all
over
the
house
they
were
heard
in
the
kitchen
they
could
have
been
heard
in
the
cellar
neither
of
them
cared
for
that
told
my
husband
screamed
sibyl
bringing
her
face
still
closer
to
edith
told
my
husband
this
man
put
that
in
your
hands
to
strike
me
with
he
did
tell
your
husband
again
i
tell
him
everything
i
know
time
your
husband
they
were
swept
asunder
by
a
bandaged
hand
you
want
the
neighbors
in
sheridan
thundered
there
fell
a
shocking
silence
frenzied
sibyl
saw
her
husband
and
his
mother
in
the
doorway
and
she
understood
what
she
had
done
she
moved
slowly
toward
the
door
then
suddenly
she
began
to
run
she
ran
into
the
hall
and
through
it
and
out
of
the
house
roscoe
followed
her
heavily
his
eyes
on
the
ground
then
said
sheridan
to
lamhorn
the
words
were
indefinite
but
the
voice
was
not
neither
was
the
vicious
gesture
of
the
bandaged
hand
which
concluded
its
orbit
in
the
direction
of
the
door
in
a
manner
sufficient
for
the
swift
dispersal
of
george
and
jackson
and
several
female
servants
who
hovered
behind
sheridan
they
fled
lightly
papa
wailed
sheridan
at
your
hand
you
to
been
so
rough
with
edie
you
hurt
your
hand
on
her
shoulder
look
there
was
in
fact
a
spreading
red
stain
upon
the
bandages
at
the
tips
of
the
fingers
and
sheridan
put
his
hand
back
in
the
sling
then
he
repeated
goin
to
leave
my
house
will
not
sobbed
edith
you
dare
order
him
out
you
bother
dear
said
lamhorn
quietly
does
understand
you
must
be
pallor
was
becoming
to
him
he
looked
very
handsome
and
as
he
left
the
room
he
seemed
in
the
girl
distraught
eyes
a
persecuted
noble
indifferent
to
the
rabble
yawping
insult
at
his
heels
the
rabble
being
enacted
by
her
father
come
back
either
said
sheridan
realistic
in
this
impersonation
off
the
premises
he
called
savagely
into
the
hall
family
through
with
you
is
not
edith
cried
breaking
from
her
mother
see
about
that
you
find
out
you
find
out
what
happen
what
he
done
i
guess
if
i
can
stand
it
it
none
of
your
business
is
it
he
done
i
like
to
know
you
do
know
anything
about
it
do
you
he
told
me
she
was
crazy
about
him
soon
as
he
began
going
there
and
he
flirted
with
her
a
little
that
everything
he
did
and
it
was
before
he
met
me
after
that
he
would
and
it
was
anything
anyway
he
never
was
serious
a
minute
about
it
she
wanted
it
to
be
serious
and
she
was
bound
she
would
give
him
up
he
told
her
long
ago
he
cared
about
me
but
she
kept
persecuting
him
and
said
sheridan
sternly
his
side
of
it
that
do
he
does
come
in
this
house
again
look
out
edith
cried
i
look
out
i
told
you
he
was
to
be
allowed
on
the
premises
but
i
had
other
things
on
my
mind
i
had
abercrombie
look
up
this
young
man
privately
and
he
no
he
no
on
earth
he
no
good
he
nothin
but
it
would
matter
if
he
was
george
washington
after
what
happened
and
what
i
heard
papa
sheridan
began
edie
says
it
was
all
fault
makin
up
to
him
and
he
never
encouraged
her
much
nor
enough
he
roared
keeps
off
these
premises
and
if
any
of
you
so
much
as
ever
speak
his
name
to
me
again
but
edith
screamed
clapping
her
hands
over
her
ears
to
shut
out
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
ran
sobbing
loudly
followed
by
her
mother
however
sheridan
descended
a
few
minutes
later
and
joined
her
husband
in
the
library
bibbs
still
sitting
in
his
gold
chair
saw
her
pass
roused
himself
from
reverie
and
strolled
in
after
her
locked
her
door
said
sheridan
shaking
her
head
woefully
would
even
answer
me
they
was
a
sound
from
her
said
her
husband
can
settle
her
mind
to
it
she
never
speaks
to
that
fellow
again
and
if
he
tries
to
telephone
her
here
you
tell
the
help
if
he
calls
up
to
ring
off
and
say
it
my
orders
no
you
need
i
tell
not
said
bibbs
gently
his
father
glared
at
him
no
good
said
bibbs
when
you
were
in
love
with
father
goodness
she
cried
ai
to
compare
your
father
to
that
feels
about
him
just
what
you
did
about
father
said
bibbs
if
your
father
had
told
you
wo
listen
to
such
silly
talk
she
declared
angrily
you
handin
out
your
advice
are
you
bibbs
said
sheridan
is
it
her
see
him
all
she
a
sheridan
gave
it
up
do
know
what
to
call
you
her
see
him
all
she
wants
bibbs
repeated
thoughtfully
up
against
something
too
strong
for
you
if
edith
were
a
weakling
you
have
a
chance
this
way
but
she
is
she
got
a
lot
of
your
determination
father
and
with
what
going
on
inside
of
her
beat
you
you
ca
keep
her
from
seeing
him
as
long
as
she
feels
about
him
the
way
she
does
now
you
ca
make
her
think
less
of
him
either
nobody
can
your
only
chance
is
that
she
do
it
for
herself
and
if
you
give
her
time
and
go
easy
she
probably
will
marriage
would
do
it
for
her
quickest
but
that
just
what
you
do
want
and
as
you
want
it
you
better
ca
stand
any
more
sheridan
burst
out
it
come
to
bibbs
advisin
me
how
to
run
this
house
i
better
resign
mamma
where
that
nigger
george
maybe
he
got
some
plan
how
i
better
manage
my
family
bibbs
for
god
sake
go
and
lay
down
her
see
him
all
she
wants
oh
lord
here
wisdom
here
said
sheridan
you
have
got
anything
to
do
you
might
step
over
and
take
sibyl
wraps
home
she
left
in
the
hall
i
do
think
you
seem
to
quiet
your
poor
father
very
much
just
and
bibbs
bore
sibyl
wraps
across
the
street
and
delivered
them
to
roscoe
who
met
him
at
the
door
bibbs
said
only
these
and
night
roscoe
cordially
and
cheerfully
and
returned
to
the
new
house
his
mother
and
father
were
still
talking
in
the
library
but
with
discretion
he
passed
rapidly
on
and
upward
to
his
own
room
and
there
he
proceeded
to
write
in
his
chapter
xxii
there
seems
to
be
another
curious
thing
about
love
bibbs
wrote
love
is
blind
while
it
lives
and
only
opens
its
eyes
and
becomes
very
wide
awake
when
it
dies
let
it
alone
until
then
you
can
not
reason
with
love
or
with
any
other
passion
the
wise
will
not
wish
for
love
nor
for
ambition
these
are
passions
and
bring
others
in
their
train
hatreds
and
jealousies
all
blind
friendship
and
a
quiet
heart
for
the
wise
what
a
turbulence
is
love
it
is
dangerous
for
a
blind
thing
to
be
turbulent
there
are
precipices
in
life
one
would
not
cross
a
with
a
thick
cloth
over
his
eyes
lovers
do
friendship
walks
gently
and
with
open
eyes
to
walk
to
church
with
a
friend
to
sit
beside
her
there
to
rise
when
she
rises
and
to
touch
with
one
thumb
and
fingers
the
other
half
of
the
that
she
holds
what
lover
with
his
fierce
ways
could
know
this
transcendent
happiness
friendship
brings
everything
that
heaven
could
bring
there
is
no
labor
that
can
not
become
a
living
rapture
if
you
know
that
a
friend
is
thinking
of
you
as
you
labor
so
you
sing
at
your
work
for
the
work
is
part
of
the
thoughts
of
your
friend
so
you
love
it
love
is
demanding
and
claiming
and
insistent
friendship
is
all
kindness
it
makes
the
world
glorious
with
kindness
what
color
you
see
when
you
walk
with
a
friend
you
see
that
the
gray
sky
is
brilliant
and
shimmering
you
see
that
the
smoke
has
warm
browns
and
is
marvelously
sculptured
the
air
becomes
iridescent
you
see
the
gold
in
brown
hair
light
floods
everything
when
you
walk
to
church
with
a
friend
you
know
that
life
can
give
you
nothing
richer
you
pray
that
there
will
be
no
change
in
anything
for
ever
what
an
adorable
thing
it
is
to
discover
a
little
foible
in
your
friend
a
bit
of
vanity
that
gives
you
one
thing
more
about
her
to
adore
on
a
cold
morning
she
will
perhaps
walk
to
church
with
you
without
her
furs
and
she
will
blush
and
return
an
evasive
answer
when
you
ask
her
why
she
does
not
wear
them
you
will
say
no
more
because
you
understand
she
looks
beautiful
in
her
furs
you
love
their
darkness
against
her
cheek
but
you
comprehend
that
they
conceal
the
loveliness
of
her
throat
and
the
fine
line
of
her
chin
and
that
she
also
has
comprehended
this
and
wishing
to
look
still
more
bewitching
discards
her
furs
at
the
risk
of
taking
cold
so
you
hold
your
peace
and
try
to
look
as
if
you
had
not
thought
it
out
this
theory
is
satisfactory
except
that
it
does
not
account
for
the
absence
of
the
muff
ah
well
there
must
always
be
a
mystery
somewhere
mystery
is
a
part
of
enchantment
manual
labor
is
best
your
heart
can
sing
and
your
mind
can
dream
while
your
hands
are
working
you
could
not
have
a
singing
heart
and
a
dreaming
mind
all
day
if
you
had
to
scheme
out
dollars
or
if
you
had
to
add
columns
of
figures
those
things
take
your
attention
you
can
not
be
thinking
of
your
friend
while
you
write
letters
beginning
of
the
inst
rec
and
contents
duly
but
to
work
with
your
hands
all
day
thinking
and
singing
and
then
after
nightfall
to
hear
the
ineffable
kindness
of
your
friend
greeting
always
there
for
you
who
would
wake
from
such
a
dream
as
this
dawn
and
the
sea
music
in
moonlit
gardens
nightingales
serenading
through
in
bloom
what
could
bring
such
things
into
the
city
turmoil
yet
they
are
here
and
roses
blossom
in
the
soot
that
is
what
it
means
not
to
be
alone
that
is
what
a
friend
gives
you
having
thus
demonstrated
that
he
was
about
and
had
formed
a
somewhat
indefinite
definition
of
friendship
but
one
entirely
his
own
and
perhaps
mary
bibbs
went
to
bed
and
was
the
only
sheridan
to
sleep
soundly
through
the
night
and
to
wake
at
dawn
with
a
light
heart
his
cheerfulness
was
vaguely
diminished
by
the
troublous
state
of
affairs
of
his
family
he
had
recognized
his
condition
when
he
wrote
would
wake
from
such
a
dream
as
this
bibbs
was
a
sympathetic
person
easily
touched
but
he
was
indeed
living
in
a
dream
and
all
things
outside
of
it
were
veiled
and
remote
for
that
is
the
way
of
youth
in
a
dream
and
bibbs
who
had
never
before
been
of
any
age
either
old
or
young
had
come
to
his
youth
at
last
he
went
whistling
from
the
house
before
even
his
father
had
come
there
was
a
fog
outdoors
saturated
with
a
fine
powder
of
soot
and
though
bibbs
noticed
absently
the
dim
shape
of
an
automobile
at
the
curb
before
roscoe
house
he
did
not
recognize
it
as
gurney
but
went
cheerily
on
his
way
through
the
dingy
mist
and
when
he
was
once
more
installed
beside
his
faithful
he
whistled
and
sang
to
it
as
other
workmen
did
to
their
own
machines
sometimes
when
things
went
well
his
comrades
in
the
shop
glanced
at
him
amusedly
now
and
then
they
liked
him
and
he
ate
his
lunch
at
noon
with
a
group
of
socialists
who
approved
of
his
ideas
and
talked
of
electing
him
to
their
association
the
short
days
of
the
year
had
come
and
it
was
dark
before
the
whistles
blew
when
the
signal
came
bibbs
went
to
the
office
where
he
divested
himself
of
his
overalls
his
single
divergence
from
the
routine
of
his
and
after
that
he
used
soap
and
water
copiously
this
was
his
transformation
scene
he
passed
into
the
office
a
rather
frail
young
noticeably
begrimed
and
passed
out
of
it
to
the
pavement
a
cheerfully
sample
of
gentry
fastidious
to
the
point
of
elegance
the
sidewalk
was
crowded
with
the
bearers
of
men
and
boys
and
women
and
girls
from
the
that
closed
at
five
many
hurried
and
some
loitered
they
went
both
east
and
west
jostling
one
another
and
bibbs
turning
his
face
homeward
was
forced
to
go
slowly
coming
toward
him
as
slowly
through
the
crowd
a
tall
girl
caught
sight
of
his
long
thin
figure
and
stood
still
until
he
had
almost
passed
her
for
in
the
thick
crowd
and
the
thicker
gloom
he
did
not
recognize
her
though
his
shoulder
actually
touched
hers
he
would
have
gone
by
but
she
laughed
delightedly
and
he
stopped
short
startled
two
boys
one
chasing
the
other
swept
between
them
and
bibbs
stood
still
peering
about
him
in
deep
perplexity
she
leaned
toward
him
knew
you
she
said
heavens
cried
bibbs
thought
it
was
your
voice
coming
out
of
a
star
only
smoke
overhead
said
mary
and
laughed
again
are
any
yes
there
were
when
you
laughed
she
took
his
arm
and
they
went
on
come
to
walk
home
with
you
bibbs
i
wanted
were
you
here
in
the
the
dark
yes
waiting
yes
bibbs
was
radiant
he
felt
suffocated
with
happiness
he
began
to
scold
her
it
not
safe
and
i
not
worth
it
you
should
have
you
ought
to
know
better
what
did
only
waited
about
twelve
seconds
she
laughed
just
got
to
come
all
this
way
and
to
this
part
of
town
in
the
dark
you
was
in
this
part
of
town
already
she
said
least
i
was
only
seven
or
eight
blocks
away
and
it
was
dark
when
i
came
out
and
have
had
to
go
home
alone
and
i
preferred
going
home
with
pretty
beautiful
for
me
said
bibbs
with
a
deep
breath
never
know
what
it
was
to
hear
your
laugh
in
the
darkness
and
then
to
to
see
you
standing
there
oh
it
was
like
it
was
like
how
can
i
tell
you
what
it
was
like
they
had
passed
beyond
the
crowd
now
and
a
shone
upon
them
which
revealed
the
fact
that
again
she
was
without
her
furs
here
was
a
puzzle
why
did
that
adorable
little
vanity
of
hers
bring
her
out
without
them
in
the
dark
but
of
course
she
had
gone
out
long
before
dark
for
undefinable
reasons
this
explanation
was
not
quite
satisfactory
however
allowing
it
to
stand
his
solicitude
for
her
took
another
turn
think
you
ought
to
have
a
car
he
said
when
you
want
to
be
out
after
dark
you
need
one
in
winter
anyhow
have
you
ever
asked
your
father
for
one
said
mary
do
think
i
care
for
one
wish
you
bibbs
tone
was
earnest
and
troubled
think
in
winter
you
no
she
interrupted
lightly
do
need
my
mother
tried
to
insist
on
sending
one
over
here
every
afternoon
for
me
i
would
let
her
because
i
like
the
walk
but
a
girl
girl
likes
to
walk
too
said
mary
me
tell
you
where
i
been
this
afternoon
and
how
i
happened
to
be
near
enough
to
make
you
take
me
home
i
been
to
see
a
little
old
man
who
makes
pictures
of
the
smoke
he
has
a
sort
of
warehouse
for
a
studio
and
he
lives
there
with
his
mother
and
his
wife
and
their
seven
children
and
he
gloriously
happy
i
seen
one
of
his
pictures
at
an
exhibition
and
i
wanted
to
see
more
of
them
so
he
showed
them
to
me
he
has
almost
everthing
he
ever
painted
i
do
suppose
he
sold
more
than
four
or
five
pictures
in
his
life
he
gives
to
keep
do
you
mean
he
paints
the
smoke
bibbs
asked
he
paints
from
his
studio
window
and
from
the
street
anywhere
he
just
paints
what
around
him
and
it
smoke
he
sees
the
sky
through
it
somehow
he
does
the
ugly
roofs
of
cheap
houses
through
a
haze
of
smoke
and
he
does
smoky
sunsets
and
smoky
sunrises
and
he
has
other
things
with
the
heavy
solid
slow
columns
of
smoke
going
far
out
and
growing
more
ethereal
and
mixing
with
the
hazy
light
in
the
distance
and
he
has
others
with
the
broken
of
all
misted
with
the
smoke
and
puffs
and
jets
of
vapor
that
have
colors
like
an
orchard
in
i
going
to
take
you
there
some
sunday
afternoon
showing
me
the
town
he
said
did
know
what
was
in
it
at
are
workers
in
beauty
here
she
told
him
gently
are
other
painters
more
prosperous
than
my
friend
there
are
all
sorts
of
did
since
the
town
began
growing
so
great
that
it
called
itself
one
could
live
here
all
one
life
and
know
only
the
side
of
it
that
seem
buried
very
deep
said
bibbs
i
imagine
that
your
friend
who
makes
the
smoke
beautiful
must
be
buried
deepest
of
all
my
father
loves
the
smoke
but
i
ca
imagine
his
buying
one
of
your
friend
pictures
he
buy
the
of
naples
but
he
get
one
of
those
he
think
smoke
in
a
picture
was
horrible
unless
he
could
use
it
for
an
she
said
thoughtfully
really
he
the
town
they
are
buried
pretty
deep
it
seems
sometimes
yet
it
all
wonderful
he
said
wonderful
to
mean
the
town
is
wonderful
to
you
because
everything
is
since
you
called
me
your
friend
the
city
is
only
a
rumble
on
the
horizon
for
me
it
ca
come
any
closer
than
the
horizon
so
long
as
you
let
me
see
you
standing
by
my
old
all
day
long
helping
me
mary
he
stopped
with
a
gasp
the
first
time
i
called
you
she
laughed
a
little
tremuously
i
wanted
you
to
said
it
without
thinking
it
must
be
because
you
came
there
to
walk
home
with
me
that
must
be
like
to
have
things
said
mary
informed
him
her
tremulous
laughter
continuing
you
glad
i
came
for
you
not
i
felt
as
if
i
were
being
carried
straight
up
and
up
and
up
over
the
clouds
i
feel
like
that
still
i
think
i
that
way
most
of
the
time
i
wonder
what
i
was
like
before
i
knew
you
the
person
i
was
then
seems
to
have
been
somebody
else
not
bibbs
sheridan
at
all
it
seems
long
long
ago
i
was
gloomy
and
sickly
somebody
else
somebody
i
do
understand
now
a
coward
afraid
of
shadows
afraid
of
things
that
did
exist
afraid
of
my
old
and
now
i
only
afraid
of
what
might
change
she
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
happy
bibbs
she
asked
do
you
see
he
cried
want
it
to
last
for
a
thousand
thousand
years
just
as
it
is
you
made
me
so
rich
i
a
miser
i
would
have
one
thing
different
nothing
nothing
bibbs
she
said
and
laughed
happily
chapter
xxiii
bibbs
continued
to
live
in
the
shelter
of
his
dream
he
had
told
edith
after
his
ineffective
effort
to
be
useful
in
her
affairs
that
he
had
decided
that
he
was
member
of
the
but
he
appeared
to
have
relapsed
to
the
retired
list
after
that
one
attempt
at
participancy
he
was
far
enough
detached
from
membership
now
these
were
turbulent
days
in
the
new
house
but
bibbs
had
no
part
whatever
in
the
turbulence
he
seemed
an
stranger
present
by
accident
and
not
wholly
aware
that
he
was
present
he
would
sit
faintly
smiling
over
pleasant
imaginings
and
dear
reminiscences
of
his
own
while
battle
raged
between
edith
and
her
father
or
while
sheridan
unloosed
jeremiads
upon
the
sullen
roscoe
who
drank
heavily
to
endure
them
the
happy
dreamer
wandered
into
like
a
somnambulist
and
wandered
out
again
unawakened
he
was
sorry
for
his
father
and
for
roscoe
and
for
edith
and
for
sibyl
but
their
sufferings
and
outcries
seemed
far
away
sibyl
was
under
gurney
care
roscoe
had
sent
for
him
on
sunday
night
not
long
after
bibbs
returned
the
abandoned
wraps
and
during
the
first
days
of
sibyl
illness
the
doctor
found
it
necessary
to
be
with
her
frequently
and
to
install
a
muscular
nurse
and
whether
he
would
or
no
gurney
received
from
his
hysterical
patient
a
variety
of
pungent
information
which
would
have
staggered
anybody
but
a
family
physician
among
other
things
he
was
given
to
comprehend
the
change
in
bibbs
and
why
the
was
not
putting
a
lump
in
the
operator
gizzard
as
of
yore
sibyl
was
not
delirious
she
was
a
thin
little
ego
writhing
and
shrieking
in
pain
life
had
hurt
her
and
had
driven
her
into
hurting
herself
her
condition
was
only
the
adult
terrible
exaggeration
of
that
of
a
child
after
a
bad
bruise
there
must
be
screaming
and
telling
mother
all
about
the
hurt
and
how
it
happened
sibyl
babbled
herself
hoarse
when
gurney
withheld
morphine
she
went
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
in
a
breath
no
protest
stopped
her
nothing
stopped
her
ought
to
let
me
die
she
wailed
cruel
not
to
let
me
die
what
harm
have
i
ever
done
to
anybody
that
you
want
to
keep
me
alive
just
look
at
my
life
i
only
married
roscoe
to
get
away
from
home
and
look
what
that
got
me
into
look
where
i
am
now
he
brought
me
to
this
town
and
what
did
i
have
in
my
life
but
his
family
and
they
even
know
the
right
crowd
if
they
had
it
might
have
been
something
i
had
nothing
nothing
nothing
in
the
world
i
wanted
to
have
a
good
time
and
how
could
i
where
any
good
time
among
these
sheridans
they
never
even
had
wine
on
the
table
i
thought
i
was
marrying
into
a
rich
family
where
i
meet
attractive
people
i
read
about
and
travel
and
go
to
dances
and
oh
my
lord
all
i
got
was
these
sheridans
i
did
the
best
i
could
i
did
indeed
oh
i
did
i
just
tried
to
live
every
woman
got
a
right
to
live
some
time
in
her
life
i
guess
things
were
just
beginning
to
look
brighter
we
moved
up
here
and
that
frozen
crowd
across
the
street
were
after
jim
for
their
daughter
and
have
started
us
with
the
right
people
and
then
i
saw
how
edith
was
getting
him
away
from
me
she
did
it
too
she
got
him
a
girl
with
money
can
do
that
to
a
married
woman
yes
she
can
every
time
and
what
could
i
do
what
can
any
woman
do
in
my
fix
i
could
do
anything
but
try
to
stand
it
and
i
could
stand
it
i
went
to
that
icicle
that
vertrees
girl
and
she
could
have
helped
me
a
little
and
it
have
hurt
her
it
would
have
done
her
any
harm
to
help
me
that
little
she
treated
me
as
if
i
been
dirt
that
she
would
even
take
the
trouble
to
sweep
out
of
her
house
let
her
wait
sibyl
voice
hoarse
from
babbling
became
no
more
than
a
husky
whisper
though
she
strove
to
make
it
louder
she
struggled
half
upright
and
the
nurse
restrained
her
get
up
out
of
this
bed
to
show
her
she
ca
do
such
things
to
me
i
was
absolutely
ladylike
and
she
walked
out
and
left
me
there
alone
she
see
she
started
after
bibbs
before
jim
casket
was
fairly
underground
and
she
thinks
landed
that
poor
loon
but
she
see
she
see
if
i
ever
able
to
walk
across
the
street
again
i
show
her
how
to
treat
a
woman
in
trouble
that
comes
to
her
for
help
it
would
have
hurt
her
any
it
would
it
would
and
edith
need
have
told
what
she
told
roscoe
it
would
have
hurt
her
to
let
me
alone
and
he
told
her
i
bored
him
telephoning
him
i
wanted
to
see
him
he
need
have
done
it
he
need
need
her
voice
grew
fainter
for
that
while
with
exhaustion
though
she
would
go
over
it
all
again
as
soon
as
her
strength
returned
she
lay
panting
then
seeing
her
husband
standing
disheveled
in
the
doorway
come
in
roscoe
she
murmured
do
want
to
see
and
as
he
turned
away
she
added
kind
of
sorry
for
you
her
antagonist
edith
was
not
more
coherent
in
her
own
wailings
and
she
had
the
advantage
of
a
mother
for
listener
she
had
also
the
disadvantage
of
a
mother
for
duenna
and
sheridan
under
her
husband
sharp
tutelage
proved
an
effective
one
edith
was
reduced
to
telephoning
lamhorn
from
shops
whenever
she
could
juggle
her
mother
into
a
momentary
distraction
over
a
counter
edith
was
incomparably
more
in
love
than
before
lamhorn
expulsion
her
whole
being
was
nothing
but
the
determination
to
hurdle
everything
that
separated
her
from
him
she
was
in
a
state
that
could
be
altered
by
only
the
lightest
and
most
delicate
diplomacy
of
suggestion
but
sheridan
like
legions
of
other
parents
intensified
her
passion
and
fed
it
hourly
fuel
by
opposing
to
it
an
intolerable
force
he
swore
she
should
cool
and
thus
set
her
on
fire
edith
planned
neatly
she
fought
hard
every
other
evening
with
her
father
and
kept
her
bed
betweentimes
to
let
him
see
what
his
violence
had
done
to
her
then
when
the
mere
sight
of
her
set
him
to
breathing
fast
she
said
pitiably
that
she
might
bear
her
trouble
better
if
she
went
away
it
was
impossible
to
be
in
the
same
town
with
lamhorn
and
not
think
always
of
him
perhaps
in
new
york
she
might
forget
a
little
she
had
written
to
a
school
friend
established
quietly
with
an
aunt
in
apartments
and
a
month
or
so
of
theaters
and
restaurants
might
bring
peace
sheridan
shouted
with
relief
he
gave
her
a
copious
cheque
and
she
left
upon
a
monday
morning
wearing
violets
with
her
mourning
and
having
kissed
everybody
except
sibyl
and
bibbs
she
might
have
kissed
bibbs
but
he
failed
to
realize
that
the
day
of
her
departure
had
arrived
and
was
surprised
on
returning
from
his
that
evening
to
find
her
gone
suppose
they
be
maried
there
he
said
casually
sheridan
seated
warming
his
stockinged
feet
at
the
fire
jumped
up
fuming
you
go
out
o
here
or
i
will
bibbs
he
snorted
do
want
to
be
in
the
same
room
with
the
particular
kind
of
idiot
you
are
she
through
with
that
all
she
needed
was
to
be
kept
away
from
him
a
few
weeks
and
i
kept
her
away
and
it
did
the
business
for
heaven
sake
go
on
out
o
here
bibbs
obeyed
the
gesture
of
a
hand
still
bandaged
and
the
black
silk
sling
was
still
round
sheridan
neck
but
no
word
of
gurney
and
no
excruciating
twinge
of
pain
could
keep
sheridan
hand
in
the
sling
the
wounds
slight
enough
originally
had
become
infected
the
first
time
he
had
dislodged
the
bandages
and
healing
was
long
delayed
sheridan
had
the
habit
of
gesture
he
could
not
time
to
remember
he
said
that
he
must
be
careful
and
he
had
also
a
curious
indignation
with
his
hurt
he
refused
to
pay
it
the
compliment
of
admitting
its
existence
the
saturday
following
edith
departure
gurney
came
to
the
sheridan
building
to
dress
the
wounds
and
to
have
a
talk
with
sheridan
which
the
doctor
felt
had
become
necessary
but
he
was
a
little
before
the
appointed
time
and
was
obliged
to
wait
a
few
minutes
in
an
anteroom
there
was
a
directors
meeting
of
some
sort
in
office
the
door
was
slightly
ajar
leaking
and
oratory
the
latter
all
sheridan
and
gurney
listened
sir
no
sir
no
sir
he
heard
the
big
voice
rumbling
and
then
breaking
into
thunder
tell
you
no
some
o
you
men
make
me
sick
you
lose
your
confidence
in
almighty
god
if
a
flipped
his
hind
leg
at
you
you
say
money
tight
all
over
the
country
well
what
if
it
is
there
no
reason
for
it
to
be
tight
and
it
not
goin
to
keep
our
money
tight
you
always
runnin
to
the
woodshed
to
hide
your
nickels
in
a
crack
because
some
fool
newspaper
says
the
market
a
little
skeery
you
listen
to
every
croaker
and
then
come
and
set
here
and
try
to
scare
me
out
of
a
big
thing
we
in
on
this
understand
i
tell
you
there
never
was
better
times
these
are
good
times
and
big
times
and
i
wo
stand
for
any
other
kind
o
talk
this
country
on
its
feet
as
it
never
was
before
and
this
city
on
its
feet
and
goin
to
stay
there
and
gurney
heard
a
series
of
whacks
and
thumps
upon
the
desk
times
sheridan
vociferated
with
accompanying
thumps
talk
these
times
are
glorious
i
tell
you
we
in
the
promised
land
and
we
goin
to
stay
there
that
all
gentlemen
the
loan
goes
the
directors
came
forth
flushed
and
murmurous
and
gurney
hastened
in
his
guess
was
correct
sheridan
had
been
thumping
the
desk
with
his
right
hand
the
physician
scolded
wearily
making
good
the
fresh
damage
as
best
he
might
and
then
he
said
what
he
had
to
say
on
the
subject
of
roscoe
and
sibyl
his
opinion
meeting
as
he
expected
a
warmly
hostile
reception
but
the
result
of
this
conversation
was
that
by
telephonic
command
roscoe
awaited
his
father
an
hour
later
in
the
library
at
the
new
house
says
your
wife
able
to
travel
sheridan
said
brusquely
as
he
came
in
roscoe
occupied
a
deep
chair
and
sat
in
the
dejected
attitude
which
had
become
his
habit
she
had
to
leave
town
and
so
sibyl
thinks
she
have
to
too
i
would
put
it
that
way
roscoe
protested
drearily
i
hear
you
would
there
was
a
bitter
gibe
in
the
voice
and
he
added
a
good
thing
she
goin
abroad
if
stay
there
i
should
think
any
of
us
want
her
here
any
more
you
least
of
all
no
use
your
talking
that
way
said
roscoe
wo
do
any
when
are
you
comin
back
to
your
office
sheridan
used
a
brisker
kinder
tone
weeks
since
you
showed
up
there
at
all
when
you
goin
to
be
ready
to
cut
out
whiskey
and
all
the
rest
o
the
foolishness
and
start
in
again
you
ought
to
be
able
to
make
up
for
a
lot
o
lost
time
and
a
lot
o
spilt
milk
when
that
woman
takes
herself
out
o
the
way
and
lets
you
and
all
the
rest
of
us
no
use
father
i
tell
you
i
know
what
gurney
was
going
to
say
to
you
i
not
going
back
to
the
office
i
done
a
minute
before
you
talk
that
way
sheridan
began
his
up
and
down
the
room
suppose
you
know
it
taken
two
pretty
good
men
about
sixteen
hours
a
day
to
set
things
straight
and
get
right
again
down
in
your
office
must
be
good
roscoe
nodded
indifferently
thought
i
was
doing
about
eight
men
work
i
glad
you
found
two
that
could
handle
here
if
i
worked
you
it
was
for
your
own
good
there
are
plenty
men
drive
i
do
and
there
are
some
that
break
down
all
the
other
men
that
work
with
they
either
die
or
go
crazy
or
have
to
quit
and
are
no
use
the
rest
of
their
lives
the
last
my
case
i
guess
by
domestic
difficulties
set
there
and
tell
me
you
give
up
sheridan
voice
shook
and
so
did
the
gesticulating
hand
which
he
extended
appealingly
toward
the
despondent
figure
do
it
roscoe
do
say
it
say
you
come
down
there
again
and
be
a
man
this
woman
ai
goin
to
trouble
you
any
more
the
work
ai
goin
to
hurt
you
if
you
have
got
her
to
worry
you
and
you
can
get
shut
o
this
nasty
it
fastened
on
you
yet
do
say
no
use
on
earth
roscoe
mumbled
use
on
here
if
you
want
another
month
vacation
know
gurney
told
you
so
what
the
use
talking
about
sheridan
vociferated
the
name
savagely
gurney
gurney
gurney
always
gurney
i
do
know
what
the
world
comin
to
with
everybody
runnin
around
squealin
doctor
says
this
and
doctor
says
that
it
makes
me
sick
how
this
country
expect
to
get
its
work
done
if
gurney
and
all
the
other
old
keep
up
this
blattin
oh
do
lift
that
stick
o
wood
you
ruin
your
nerves
so
he
says
you
got
exhaustion
induced
by
overwork
and
emotional
strain
they
always
got
to
stick
the
work
in
if
they
see
a
chance
i
reckon
you
did
have
the
strain
and
that
the
matter
with
you
you
be
over
it
soon
this
woman
gone
and
work
the
very
thing
to
make
you
quit
frettin
about
gurney
tell
you
i
was
fit
to
work
up
sheridan
bellowed
so
sick
o
that
man
name
i
feel
like
shootin
anybody
that
says
it
to
me
he
fumed
and
chafed
swearing
indistinctly
then
came
and
stood
before
his
son
here
do
you
think
you
doin
the
square
thing
by
me
do
you
how
much
you
worth
got
between
seven
and
eight
thousand
a
year
clear
of
my
own
outside
the
salary
that
much
is
mine
whether
i
work
or
is
you
pulled
it
out
without
me
i
suppose
you
think
at
your
age
but
it
mine
and
it
lord
it
about
what
a
congressman
gets
and
you
want
to
quit
there
i
suppose
you
think
you
get
the
rest
when
i
kick
the
bucket
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
lay
back
and
wait
you
let
me
tell
you
right
here
you
never
see
one
cent
of
it
you
go
out
o
business
now
and
what
would
you
know
about
handlin
it
five
or
ten
or
twenty
years
from
now
because
i
intend
to
stay
here
a
little
while
yet
my
boy
either
get
it
away
from
you
or
you
sell
for
a
nickel
and
let
it
be
split
up
and
he
whirled
about
marched
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
stood
silent
a
moment
then
he
said
solemnly
if
you
go
out
now
you
leave
me
in
the
lurch
with
nothin
on
god
green
earth
to
depend
on
but
your
brother
and
you
know
what
he
is
i
depended
on
you
for
it
all
since
jim
died
now
you
listened
to
that
dam
doctor
and
he
says
maybe
you
wo
ever
be
as
good
a
man
as
you
were
and
that
certainly
you
wo
be
for
a
year
or
so
probably
more
now
that
all
a
lie
men
do
break
down
that
way
at
your
age
look
at
me
and
i
tell
you
you
can
shake
this
thing
off
all
you
need
is
a
little
and
a
little
gumption
men
do
go
away
for
years
and
then
come
back
into
moving
businesses
like
ours
they
lose
the
strings
and
if
you
could
i
wo
let
you
if
you
lay
down
on
me
now
i
wo
and
that
because
if
you
lay
down
you
prove
you
ai
the
man
i
thought
you
he
cleared
his
throat
and
finished
quietly
will
you
take
a
vacation
and
come
back
and
go
to
it
said
roscoe
listlessly
right
said
sheridan
he
picked
up
the
evening
paper
from
a
table
went
to
a
chair
by
the
fire
and
sat
down
his
back
to
his
son
roscoe
rose
his
head
hanging
but
there
was
a
dull
relief
in
his
eyes
i
can
do
he
muttered
seeming
about
to
depart
yet
lingering
figure
it
out
a
good
deal
like
this
he
said
did
know
my
job
was
any
strain
and
i
managed
all
right
but
from
what
gur
from
what
i
hear
i
was
just
up
to
the
limit
of
my
nerves
from
overwork
and
the
the
trouble
at
home
was
the
extra
strain
that
fixed
me
the
way
i
am
i
tried
to
brace
so
i
could
stand
the
work
and
the
trouble
too
on
whiskey
and
that
put
the
finish
to
me
i
i
not
hitting
it
as
hard
as
i
was
for
a
while
and
i
reckon
pretty
soon
if
i
can
get
to
feeling
a
little
more
energy
i
better
try
to
quit
entirely
i
do
know
i
all
in
and
the
doctor
says
so
i
thought
i
was
running
along
fine
up
to
a
few
months
ago
but
all
the
time
i
was
ready
to
bust
and
did
know
it
now
then
i
do
want
you
to
blame
sibyl
and
if
i
were
you
i
would
speak
of
her
as
woman
because
she
your
and
going
to
stay
that
way
she
did
do
anything
wicked
it
was
a
shock
to
me
and
i
do
deny
it
to
find
what
she
had
done
encouraging
that
fellow
to
hang
around
her
after
he
began
trying
to
flirt
with
her
and
losing
her
head
over
him
the
way
she
did
i
deny
it
was
a
shock
and
that
it
always
be
a
hurt
inside
of
me
never
get
over
but
it
was
my
fault
i
did
understand
a
poor
roscoe
spoke
in
the
most
profound
and
desolate
earnest
woman
craves
society
and
gaiety
and
meeting
attractive
people
and
traveling
well
i
ca
give
her
the
other
things
but
i
can
give
her
the
traveling
real
traveling
not
just
going
to
atlantic
city
or
new
orleans
the
way
she
has
two
three
times
a
woman
has
to
have
something
in
her
life
besides
a
business
man
and
that
all
i
was
i
never
understood
till
i
heard
her
talking
when
she
was
so
sick
and
i
believe
if
you
heard
her
then
you
would
speak
so
about
her
i
believe
you
might
have
forgiven
her
like
i
have
all
i
never
cared
anything
for
any
girl
but
her
in
my
life
but
i
was
so
busy
with
business
i
put
it
ahead
of
her
i
never
thought
about
her
i
was
so
busy
thinking
business
well
this
is
where
it
brought
us
to
and
now
when
you
talk
about
to
me
i
feel
the
way
you
do
when
anybody
talks
about
gurney
to
you
the
word
makes
me
dizzy
it
makes
me
honestly
sick
at
the
stomach
i
believe
if
i
had
to
go
and
step
inside
that
office
door
i
fall
down
on
the
floor
deathly
sick
you
talk
about
a
vacation
and
i
get
just
as
sick
i
rattled
i
ca
plan
i
have
got
any
plans
ca
make
any
except
to
take
my
girl
and
get
just
as
far
away
from
that
office
as
i
can
and
stay
we
going
to
japan
first

nodded

here
bibbs
came
through
the
hall
whistling
and
entered
the
room
briskly
father
did
you
want
me
sit
sheridan
got
up
and
bibbs
took
a
seat
by
the
fire
holding
out
his
hands
to
the
crackling
blaze
for
it
was
cold
outdoors
came
within
seven
of
the
shop
record
he
said
handled
more
strips
than
any
other
workman
has
any
day
this
month
the
nearest
to
me
is
sixteen
exclaimed
his
father
greatly
pleased
i
tell
you
i
like
to
hear
gurney
hint
again
that
i
was
right
in
sending
you
there
i
would
just
like
to
hear
him
and
you
ai
you
ashamed
of
makin
such
a
fuss
about
it
ai
you
did
go
at
it
in
the
right
spirit
the
other
time
bibbs
said
smiling
brightly
his
face
ruddy
in
the
cheerful
firelight
know
the
difference
it
meant
to
like
a
i
guess
i
pretty
thoroughly
vindicated
my
judgement
i
guess
i
have
i
said
the
shop
be
good
for
you
and
it
was
i
said
it
hurt
you
and
it
has
it
been
just
exactly
what
i
said
it
would
be
ai
that
so
like
it
bibbs
agreed
gaily
i
like
to
know
any
place
i
been
wrong
first
and
last
instead
o
hurting
you
it
been
the
makin
of
you
physically
you
a
good
inch
what
i
am
and
you
be
a
bigger
man
than
what
i
am
if
you
get
some
flesh
on
your
bones
and
you
are
gettin
a
little
physically
it
started
you
out
to
be
the
huskiest
one
o
the
whole
family
now
then
mentally
that
different
i
do
say
it
unkindly
bibbs
but
you
got
to
do
something
for
yourself
mentally
just
like
what
begun
physically
and
i
goin
to
help
sheridan
decided
to
sit
down
again
he
brought
his
chair
close
to
his
son
and
leaning
over
tapped
bibbs
knee
confidentially
got
plans
for
you
bibbs
he
said
bibbs
instantly
looked
thoroughly
alarmed
he
drew
back
i
all
right
now
sheridan
settled
himself
in
his
chair
and
spoke
in
the
tone
of
a
reasonable
man
reasoning
here
bibbs
i
had
another
blow
and
it
was
a
hard
one
and
right
in
the
face
though
i
have
been
expectin
it
some
little
time
back
well
it
got
to
be
met
now
be
frank
with
you
as
i
said
a
minute
ago
mentally
i
could
ever
called
you
exactly
strong
you
been
a
little
weak
both
ways
most
of
your
life
not
but
what
i
think
you
got
a
mentality
if
you
learn
to
use
it
you
got
i
say
that
for
you
i
never
knew
boy
or
man
that
could
be
stubborner
never
one
in
my
life
now
then
showed
you
could
learn
to
run
that
machine
best
of
any
man
in
the
shop
in
no
time
at
all
that
looks
to
me
like
you
could
learn
to
do
other
things
i
do
deny
but
what
it
an
encouragin
sign
i
do
deny
that
at
all
well
that
helps
me
to
think
the
case
ai
so
hopeless
as
it
looks
you
all
i
got
to
meet
this
blow
with
but
maybe
you
as
poor
material
as
i
thought
your
tellin
me
about
comin
within
seven
strips
of
the
shop
record
looks
to
me
like
information
brought
in
at
just
about
the

bibbs
jumped
to
his
feet
blanched
no
he
cried
sheridan
took
his
dismay
to
be
the
excitement
of
sudden
joy
sir
and
there
some
pretty
fat
little
salaries
goes
with
those
and
a
pinch
o
stock
in
the
pump
company
with
the
directorship
you
thought
i
was
pretty
mean
about
the
shop
oh
i
know
you
did
but
you
see
the
old
man
can
play
it
both
ways
and
so
right
now
the
minute
you
begun
to
make
good
the
way
i
wanted
you
to
i
deal
from
the
new
deck
and
i
keep
on
handin
it
out
bigger
and
bigger
every
time

show
me
you
big
enough
to
play
the
hand
i
deal
you
i
startin
you
with
a
pretty
big
one
my
boy
i
do
i
do
i
do
want
it
bibbs
stammered
you
say
sheridan
thought
he
had
not
heard
aright
do
want
it
father
i
thank
you
i
do
thank
you
sheridan
looked
perplexed
the
matter
with
you
did
you
understand
what
i
was
tellin
you
sure
i
reckon
you
did
i
offered
know
i
know
but
i
ca
take
the
matter
with
you
sheridan
was
half
amazed
half
suspicious
head
feel
funny
never
been
quite
so
sane
in
my
life
said
bibbs
i
have
lately
and
i
got
just
what
i
want
i
living
exactly
the
right
life
i
earning
my
daily
bread
and
i
happy
in
doing
it
my
wages
are
enough
i
do
want
any
more
money
and
i
do
deserve
any
sheridan
sprang
up
turned
socialist
you
been
listening
to
those
fellows
down
there
and
you
sir
i
think
there
a
great
deal
in
what
they
say
but
that
sheridan
tried
to
restrain
his
growing
fury
and
succeeded
partially
what
is
it
what
the
matter
his
son
returned
nervously
except
that
content
i
do
want
to
change
not
bibbs
had
the
incredible
folly
to
try
to
explain
tell
you
father
if
i
can
i
know
it
may
be
hard
to
understand
i
think
it
may
be
said
sheridan
grimly
you
say
usually
is
a
little
that
way
go
on
perturbed
and
distressed
bibbs
rose
instinctively
he
felt
himself
at
every
possible
disadvantage
he
was
a
sleeper
clinging
to
a
dream
a
rough
hand
stretched
to
shake
him
and
waken
him
he
went
to
a
table
and
made
vague
drawings
upon
it
with
a
finger
and
as
he
spoke
he
kept
his
eyes
lowered
were
altogether
right
about
the
shop
that
is
in
one
way
you
were
he
glanced
up
apprehensively
sheridan
stood
facing
him
expressionless
and
made
no
attempt
to
interrupt
difficult
to
explain
bibbs
continued
lowering
his
eyes
again
to
follow
the
tracings
of
his
finger
i
believe
the
shop
might
have
done
for
me
this
time
if
i
had
if
something
had
helped
me
to
oh
not
only
to
bear
it
but
to
be
happy
in
it
well
i
am
happy
in
it
i
want
to
go
on
just
as
i
am
and
of
all
things
on
earth
that
i
want
i
do
want
to
live
a
business
life
i
do
want
to
be
drawn
into
it
i
do
think
it
is
living
and
now
i
am
living
i
have
the
healthful
toil
and
i
can
think
in
business
as
important
as
yours
i
could
think
anything
but
business
i
do
i
do
think
making
money
is
worth
on
said
sheridan
curtly
as
bibbs
paused
timidly
has
seemed
to
get
anywhere
that
i
can
see
said
bibbs
think
this
city
is
rich
and
powerful
but
what
the
use
of
its
being
rich
and
powerful
they
do
teach
the
children
any
more
in
the
schools
because
the
city
is
rich
and
powerful
they
teach
them
more
than
they
used
to
because
some
people
not
rich
and
powerful
people
have
thought
the
thoughts
to
teach
the
children
and
yet
when
you
been
reading
the
paper
i
heard
you
objecting
to
the
children
being
taught
anything
except
what
would
help
them
to
make
money
you
said
it
was
wasting
the
taxes
you
want
them
taught
to
make
a
living
but
not
to
live
when
i
was
a
little
boy
this
was
an
ugly
town
now
it
hideous
what
the
use
of
being
big
just
to
be
hideous
i
mean
i
do
think
all
this
has
meant
really
going
ahead
it
just
been
getting
bigger
and
dirtier
and
noisier
was
the
whole
country
happier
and
in
many
ways
wiser
when
it
was
smaller
and
cleaner
and
quieter
and
kinder
i
know
you
think
i
an
utter
fool
father
but
after
all
though
are
business
and
politics
just
the
housekeeping
part
of
life
and
would
you
despise
a
woman
that
not
only
made
her
housekeeping
her
ambition
but
did
it
so
noisily
and
dirtily
that
the
whole
neighborhood
was
in
a
continual
turmoil
over
it
and
suppose
she
talked
and
thought
about
her
housekeeping
all
the
time
and
was
always
having
additions
built
to
her
house
when
she
could
keep
clean
what
she
already
had
and
suppose
with
it
all
she
made
the
house
altogether
unpeaceful
and
unlivable
one
minute
sheridan
interrupted
adding
with
terrible
courtesy
you
will
permit
me
have
you
ever
been
right
about
anything
do
quite
ask
the
simple
question
have
you
ever
been
right
about
anything
whatever
in
the
course
of
your
life
have
you
ever
been
right
upon
any
subject
or
question
you
thought
about
and
talked
about
can
you
mention
one
single
time
when
you
were
proved
to
be
right
he
was
flourishing
the
bandaged
hand
as
he
spoke
but
bibbs
said
only
i
always
been
wrong
before
surely
there
more
chance
that
right
about
this
it
seems
reasonable
to
suppose
something
would
be
due
to
bring
up
my
i
thought
you
would
see
the
point
and
there
another
you
probably
could
see
but
i
take
the
liberty
to
mention
it
you
been
balkin
all
your
life
pretty
much
everything
i
ever
wanted
you
to
do
you
let
out
some
kind
of
a
holler
like
you
are
now
and
yet
i
seem
to
remember
once
when
you
did
have
to
lay
down
and
do
what
i
said
but
go
on
with
your
remarks
about
our
city
and
the
business
of
this
country
go
on
do
want
to
be
a
part
of
it
said
bibbs
with
unwonted
decision
want
to
keep
to
myself
and
i
doing
it
now
i
could
if
i
went
down
there
with
you
i
be
swallowed
into
it
i
do
care
for
money
enough
to
his
father
interrupted
still
dangerously
quiet
never
had
to
earn
a
living
anybody
could
tell
that
by
what
you
say
now
let
me
remind
you
you
sleepin
in
a
pretty
good
bed
you
eatin
pretty
fair
food
you
wearin
pretty
fine
clothes
just
suppose
one
o
these
noisy
housekeepers
me
for
instance
decided
to
let
you
do
your
own
housekeepin
may
i
ask
what
your
proposition
would
be
earning
nine
dollars
a
week
said
bibbs
sturdily
enough
i
should
mind
at
payin
you
that
nine
dollars
a
week
work
bibbs
answered
i
done
so
well
on
that
i
believe
i
could
work
up
to
fifteen
or
even
twenty
a
week
at
another
job
i
could
be
a
fair
plumber
in
a
few
months
i
sure
i
rather
have
a
trade
than
be
in
business
i
should
infinitely
better
set
about
learnin
one
pretty
dam
quick
but
sheridan
struggled
with
his
temper
and
again
was
partially
successful
in
controlling
it
better
learn
a
trade
over
sunday
because
either
goin
down
with
me
to
my
office
monday
morning
or
you
can
go
to
plumbing
right
said
bibbs
gently
can
get
sheridan
raised
his
hands
sardonically
as
in
prayer
god
he
said
boy
was
crazy
enough
before
he
began
to
earn
his
nine
dollars
a
week
and
now
his
money
gone
to
his
head
ca
you
do
nothin
for
him
then
he
flung
his
hands
apart
palms
outward
in
a
furious
gesture
of
dismissal
out
o
this
room
you
got
a
skull
that
a
whale
but
it
cracked
spang
all
the
way
across
you
hated
the
so
bad
when
i
sent
you
there
you
went
and
stayed
sick
for
over
two
years
and
now
when
i
offer
to
take
you
out
of
it
and
give
you
the
mint
you
holler
for
the
shop
like
a
calf
for
its
mammy

oh
but
i

a
fine
layout
here
one
son

one

and
one
a
loon
the
loon
all

ellersly
wife
had
a
crazy
brother
and
they
undertook
to
keep
him
at
the
house
first
morning
he
was
there
he
walked
straight
though
a
window
out
into
the
yard
he
says

at
the
pretty
dandelion
that
what
you
doin
you
want
to
spend
your
life

look
at
the
pretty
dandelion

and
i
lam

until
i
made
something
out
of
you
that
fit
to
be
called
a
business
man
i
keep
at
you
while
i
able
to
stand
and
if
i
have
to
lay

till
they

the
into
me
now
go
on
and
let
me
hear
from
you
again
till
you
can
come
and
tell
me
you
waked
up
you
poor
pitiful
bibbs
gave
him
a
queer
look
there
was
something
like
reproach
in
it
for
once
but
there
was
more
than
that
he
seemed
to
be
startled
by
his
father
last
word
chapter
xxv
there
was
sleet
that
evening
with
a
whopping
wind
but
neither
this
storm
nor
that
other
which
so
imminently
threatened
him
held
place
in
the
consciousness
of
bibbs
sheridan
when
he
came
once
more
to
the
presence
of
mary
all
was
right
in
his
world
as
he
sat
with
her
reading
maurice
maeterlinck
alladine
and
palomides
the
sorrowful
light
of
the
might
have
been
may
morning
sunshine
flashing
amber
and
rose
through
the
glowing
windows
of
the
it
was
so
bright
for
bibbs
and
while
the
held
out
to
bring
him
such
golden
nights
as
these
all
the
king
horses
and
all
the
king
men
might
not
serve
to
break
the
spell
bibbs
read
slowly
but
in
a
reasonable
manner
as
if
he
were
talking
and
mary
looking
at
him
steadily
from
beneath
her
curved
fingers
appeared
to
discover
no
fault
it
had
grown
to
be
her
habit
to
look
at
him
whenever
there
was
an
opportunity
it
may
be
said
in
truth
that
while
they
were
together
and
it
was
light
she
looked
at
him
all
the
time
when
he
came
to
the
end
of
alladine
and
palomides
they
were
silent
a
little
while
considering
together
then
he
turned
back
the
pages
and
said
something
i
want
to
read
over
this
you
would
think
i
threw
a
window
open
on
the
dawn
she
has
a
soul
that
can
be
seen
around
her
that
takes
you
in
its
arms
like
an
ailing
child
and
without
saying
anything
to
you
consoles
you
for
everything
i
shall
never
understand
it
all
i
do
not
know
how
it
can
all
be
but
my
knees
bend
in
spite
of
me
when
i
speak
of
it
he
stopped
and
looked
at
her
boy
said
mary
not
very
clearly
yes
he
returned
it
true
especially
my
knees
boy
she
murmured
again
blushing
charmingly
might
read
another
line
over
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
you
bibbs
you
were
looking
into
a
mirror
do
it
again
but
you
need
read
it
i
can
give
it
to
you
little
greek
slave
that
came
from
the
heart
of
arcady
i
one
of
the
hands
at
the
pump
works
and
going
to
stay
one
unless
i
have
to
decide
to
study
she
shook
her
head
love
and
want
what
beautiful
and
delicate
and
serene
it
really
art
that
you
want
in
your
life
and
have
always
wanted
you
seemed
to
me
from
the
first
the
most
wistful
person
i
had
ever
known
and
that
what
you
were
wistful
bibbs
looked
doubtful
and
more
wistful
than
ever
but
after
a
moment
or
two
the
matter
seemed
to
clarify
itself
to
him
no
he
said
wanted
something
else
more
than
that
i
wanted
here
i
am
she
laughed
completely
understanding
think
like
those
two
in
the
cloister
and
the
hearth
i
just
the
rough
burgundian
man
denys
who
followed
that
gentle
gerard
and
told
everybody
that
the
devil
was
is
though
said
bibbs
as
a
hoarse
little
bell
in
the
next
room
began
a
series
of
snappings
which
proved
to
be
ten
upon
count
gets
into
the
clock
whenever
i
with
and
sighing
deeply
he
rose
to
go
always
very
prompt
about
leaving
i
try
to
be
he
said
is
easy
to
be
careful
not
to
risk
everything
by
giving
myself
a
little
more
at
a
time
if
i
ever
saw
you
look
tired
you
ever
yet
you
always
look
you
always
look
that
it
except
when
you
feel
sorry
for
me
about
something
you
always
have
that
splendid
look
it
puts
courage
into
people
to
see
it
if
i
had
a
struggle
to
face
i
keep
remembering
that
look
and
i
never
give
up
it
a
brave
look
too
as
though
gaiety
might
be
a
kind
of
gallantry
on
your
part
and
yet
i
do
quite
understand
why
it
should
be
he
smiled
quizzically
looking
down
upon
her
you
have
a
sorrow
have
you
for
answer
she
only
laughed
he
said
ca
imagine
you
with
a
care
in
the
world
i
think
that
why
you
were
so
kind
to
me
you
have
nothing
but
happiness
in
your
own
life
and
so
you
could
spare
time
to
make
my
troubles
turn
to
happiness
too
but
there
one
little
time
in
the
hours
when
i
not
happy
it
now
when
i
have
to
say
good
night
i
feel
dismal
every
time
it
comes
and
then
when
i
left
the
house
a
bad
little
blankness
a
black
void
as
though
i
were
temporarily
dead
and
it
lasts
until
i
get
it
established
in
my
mind
that
i
really
beginning
another
day
that
to
end
with
you
again
then
i
cheer
up
but
now
the
bad
time
and
i
must
go
through
it
and
so
good
and
he
added
with
a
pungent
vehemence
of
which
he
was
little
aware
hate
it
you
she
said
rising
to
go
to
the
door
with
him
but
he
stood
motionless
gazing
at
her
wonderingly
your
eyes
are
so
he
stopped
but
she
looked
quickly
away
do
know
he
said
thought
just
then
did
you
think
do
know
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
something
i
ought
to
understand
and
she
laughed
and
met
his
wondering
gaze
again
frankly
eyes
are
pleased
she
said
glad
that
you
miss
me
a
little
after
you
coming
faster
than
other
days
if
you
let
it
he
said
she
inclined
her
head
i
it
to
church
said
bibbs
is
going
to
church
when
i
go
with
you
she
went
to
the
front
door
with
him
she
always
went
that
far
they
had
formed
a
little
code
of
by
habit
neither
of
them
ever
speaking
of
it
but
it
was
always
the
same
she
always
stood
in
the
doorway
until
he
reached
the
sidewalk
and
there
he
always
turned
and
looked
back
and
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
then
he
went
on
halfway
to
the
new
house
and
looked
back
again
and
mary
was
not
in
the
doorway
but
the
door
was
open
and
the
light
shone
it
was
as
if
she
meant
to
tell
him
that
she
would
never
shut
him
out
he
could
always
see
that
friendly
light
of
the
open
doorway
as
if
it
were
open
for
him
to
come
back
if
he
would
he
could
see
it
until
a
wing
of
the
new
house
came
between
when
he
went
up
the
path
the
open
doorway
seemed
to
him
the
beautiful
symbol
of
her
friendship
of
her
thought
of
him
a
symbol
of
herself
and
of
her
ineffable
kindness
and
she
kept
the
door
open
even
though
the
sleet
and
fine
snow
swept
in
upon
her
bare
throat
and
arms
and
her
brown
hair
was
strewn
with
tiny
white
stars
his
heart
leaped
as
he
turned
and
saw
that
she
was
there
waving
her
hand
to
him
as
if
she
did
not
know
that
the
storm
touched
her
when
he
had
gone
on
mary
did
as
she
always
did
she
went
into
an
unlit
room
across
the
hall
from
that
in
which
they
had
spent
the
evening
and
looking
from
the
window
watched
him
until
he
was
out
of
sight
the
storm
made
that
difficult
but
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
under
the
that
stood
between
the
two
houses
and
saw
that
he
turned
to
look
back
again
then
and
not
before
she
looked
at
the
upper
windows
of
roscoe
house
across
the
street
they
were
dark
mary
waited
but
after
a
little
while
she
closed
the
front
door
and
returned
to
her
window
a
moment
later
two
of
the
upper
windows
of
roscoe
house
flashed
into
light
and
a
hand
lowered
the
shade
of
one
of
them
mary
felt
the
cold
then
it
was
the
third
night
she
had
seen
those
windows
lighted
and
the
shade
lowered
just
after
bibbs
had
gone
but
bibbs
had
no
glance
to
spare
for
roscoe
windows
he
stopped
for
his
last
look
back
at
the
open
door
and
with
a
thin
mantle
of
white
already
upon
his
shoulders
made
his
way
gasping
in
the
wind
to
the
lee
of
the
sheltering
wing
of
the
new
house
a
stricken
george
muttering
hoarsely
admitted
him
and
bibbs
became
aware
of
a
paroxysm
within
the
house
terrible
sounds
came
from
the
library
sheridan
cursing
as
never
before
his
wife
sobbing
her
voice
rising
to
an
agonized
squeal
of
protest
upon
each
of
a
series
of
muffled
detonations
the
outrageous
thumping
of
a
bandaged
hand
upon
wood
then
gurney
sharply
imperious
your
hand
in
that
sling
keep
your
hand
in
that
sling
i
say
george
gasped
delighted
to
play
herald
for
so
important
a
tragedy
and
he
renewed
upon
his
face
the
ghastly
expression
with
which
he
had
first
beheld
the
ruins
his
calamitous
gesture
laid
before
the
eyes
of
bibbs
at
lamidal
statue
gazing
down
the
hall
bibbs
saw
heroic
wreckage
seemingly
byzantine
painted
colossal
fragments
of
the
shattered
torso
appallingly
human
and
gilded
and
silvered
heaps
of
magnificence
strewn
among
ruinous
palms
like
the
spoil
of
a
barbarians
battle
there
had
been
a
massacre
in
the
oasis
the
moor

been
hurled

chapter
xxvi
george
departed
and
bibbs
was
left
gazing
upon
chaos
and
listening
to
thunder
he
could
not
reach
the
stairway
without
passing
the
open
doors
of
the
library
and
he
was
convinced
that
the
mere
glimpse
of
him
just
then
would
prove
nothing
less
than
insufferable
for
his
father
for
that
reason
he
was
about
to
make
his
escape
into
the
room
intending
to
keep
out
of
sight
when
he
heard
sheridan
vociferously
demanding
his
presence
him
to
come
in
here
he
out
there
i
heard
george
just
let
him
in
now
you
see
and
sheridan
looking
out
into
the
hall
beckoned
to
her
son
bibbs
went
as
far
as
the
doorway
gurney
sat
winding
a
strip
of
white
cotton
his
black
bag
open
upon
a
chair
near
by
and
sheridan
was
striding
up
and
down
his
hand
so
heavily
wrapped
in
fresh
bandages
that
he
seemed
to
be
wearing
a
small
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
his
forehead
was
heavily
bedewed
one
side
of
his
collar
had
broken
loose
and
there
were
upon
his
right
cuff
our
little
sunshine
he
cried
as
bibbs
appeared
the
hope
o
the
family
my
lifelong
pride
and
joy
i
want
you
hand
in
that
sling
said
gurney
sharply
sheridan
turned
upon
him
uttering
a
sound
like
a
howl
god
sake
sing
another
tune
he
cried
said
you
as
a
doctor
but
stay
as
a
friend
and
in
that
capacity
you
undertake
to
sit
up
and
criticize
me
talk
sense
said
the
doctor
and
yawned
intentionally
do
you
want
bibbs
to
say
were
sittin
up
there
tellin
me
i
got
oh
lord
you
sat
up
there
and
told
me
i
got
over
nothin
you
sat
up
there
tellin
me
i
did
have
as
heavy
burdens
as
many
another
man
you
knew
i
just
want
you
to
hear
this
now
listen
he
swung
toward
the
quiet
figure
waiting
in
the
doorway
will
you
come
with
me
monday
morning
and
let
me
start
you
with
two
a
directorship
stock
and
salaries
i
ask
father
said
bibbs
gently
sheridan
looked
at
gurney
and
then
faced
his
son
once
more
you
want
to
stay
in
the
shop
do
you
at
nine
dollars
a
week
instead
of
takin
up
my
offer
i
like
the
doctor
to
hear
what
you
do
if
i
decide
too
a
either
to
live
in
my
house
or
work
in
my
shop
other
work
said
bibbs
you
hear
him
for
yourself
sheridan
cried
hear
what
you
hand
in
that
sling
yes
i
hear
sheridan
leaned
over
gurney
and
shouted
in
a
voice
that
cracked
and
broke
piping
into
falsetto
thinks
of
bein
a
plumber
he
wants
to
be
a
plumber
he
told
me
he
could
think
if
he
went
into
business
he
wants
to
be
a
plumber
so
he
can
think
he
fell
back
a
step
wiping
his
forhead
with
the
back
of
his
left
hand
that
my
son
that
the
only
son
i
got
now
that
my
chance
to
live
he
cried
with
a
bitterness
that
seemed
to
leave
ashes
in
his
throat
my
one
chance
to
live
that
thing
you
see
in
the
doorway
yonder
gurney
thoughtfully
regarded
the
bandage
strip
he
had
been
winding
and
tossed
it
into
the
open
bag
the
matter
with
giving
bibbs
a
chance
to
live
he
said
coolly
would
if
i
were
you
you
had
two
that
went
into
sheridan
mouth
moved
grotesquely
before
he
could
speak
gurney
he
said
when
he
could
command
himself
so
far
you
accusin
me
of
the
responsibility
for
the
death
of
my
son
james
accuse
you
of
nothing
said
the
doctor
just
once
i
like
to
have
it
out
with
you
on
the
question
of
bibbs
and
while
he
here
he
got
up
walked
to
the
fire
and
stood
warming
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
smiling
here
old
fellow
let
be
reasonable
he
said
were
bound
bibbs
should
go
to
the
shop
again
and
i
gave
you
and
him
both
to
understand
pretty
plainly
that
if
he
went
it
was
at
the
risk
of
his
life
well
what
did
he
do
he
said
he
wanted
to
go
and
he
did
go
and
he
made
good
there
now
see
is
that
enough
you
let
him
off
now
he
wants
to
write
and
how
do
you
know
that
he
could
do
it
if
you
gave
him
a
chance
how
do
you
know
he
has
some
message
something
to
say
that
might
make
the
world
just
a
little
bit
happier
or
wiser
he
might
in
time
it
a
possibility
not
to
be
denied
now
he
ca
deliver
any
message
if
he
goes
down
there
with
you
and
he
wo
have
any
to
deliver
i
do
say
going
down
with
you
is
likely
to
injure
his
health
as
i
thought
the
shop
would
and
as
the
shop
did
the
first
time
i
not
speaking
as
doctor
now
anyhow
but
i
tell
you
one
thing
i
know
if
you
take
him
down
there
you
kill
something
that
i
feel
is
in
him
and
it
finer
i
think
than
his
physical
body
and
you
kill
it
deader
than
a
and
so
why
not
let
it
live
you
about
come
to
the
end
of
your
string
old
fellow
why
not
stop
this
perpetual
devilish
fighting
and
give
bibbs
his
chance
sheridan
stood
looking
at
him
fixedly
with
gurney
sustained
the
daunting
gaze
of
his
fierce
antagonist
equably
do
seem
to
understand
that
you
been
struggling
against
actual
law
law
said
gurney
do
you
think
beat
you
with
edith
did
edith
herself
beat
you
did
she
obey
without
question
something
powerful
that
was
against
you
edith
was
against
you
and
you
against
her
but
you
set
yourself
against
the
power
that
had
her
in
its
grip
and
it
shot
out
a
spurt
of
flame
and
won
in
a
walk
what
taken
roscoe
from
you
timbers
bear
just
so
much
strain
old
man
but
you
wanted
to
send
the
load
across
the
broken
bridge
and
you
thought
you
could
bully
or
coax
the
cracked
thing
into
standing
well
you
could
now
here
bibbs
there
are
thousands
of
men
fit
for
the
life
you
want
him
to
lead
and
so
is
he
it
would
take
half
of
bibbs
brains
to
be
twice
as
good
a
business
man
as
jim
and
roscoe
put
sheridan
goggled
at
him
like
a
zany
son
bibbs
said
the
doctor
composedly
sheridan
has
the
kind
and
quantity
of
matter
that
will
make
him
a
success
in
anything
if
he
ever
wakes
up
personally
i
should
prefer
him
to
remain
asleep
i
like
him
that
way
but
the
thousands
of
men
fit
for
the
life
you
want
him
to
lead
are
fit
to
do
much
with
the
life
he
ought
to
lead
blindly
he
been
fighting
for
the
chance
to
lead
it
obeying
something
that
begs
to
stay
alive
within
him
and
blindly
he
knows
you
crush
it
out
you
set
your
will
to
do
it
let
me
tell
you
something
more
you
do
know
what
you
become
since
jim
going
thwarted
you
and
that
what
was
uppermost
a
bafflement
stronger
than
your
normal
grief
you
half
mad
with
a
consuming
fury
against
the
very
self
of
the
law
for
it
was
the
very
self
of
the
law
that
took
jim
from
you
that
was
a
law
concerning
the
cohesion
of
molecules
the
very
self
of
the
law
took
roscoe
from
you
and
gave
edith
the
certainty
of
beating
you
and
the
very
self
of
the
law
makes
bibbs
deny
you
the
law
beats
you
have
you
been
whipped
enough
but
you
want
to
whip
the
law
you
set
yourself
against
it
to
bend
it
to
your
own
ends
to
wield
it
and
twist
it
the
voice
broke
from
sheridan
heaving
chest
in
a
shout
and
by
god
i
will
ajax
defied
the
lightning
said
gurney
heard
that
story
too
sheridan
retorted
fiercely
for
chuldern
and
niggers

ai
twentieth
century

lot
about

sheridan
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
again
and
the
doctor
returned
gloomily
to
his
chair
he
had
shot
his
bolt
the
moment
he
judged
its
chance
to
strike
center
was
best
but
the
target
seemed
unaware
of
the
marksman
tryin
to
make
a
big
man
out
o
that
poor
truck

sheridan
went
on

said
gurney
wearily
there
was
a
bronze
inkstand
upon
the
table
sheridan
put
his
right
hand
in
the
sling
but
with
his
left
he
swept
the
inkstand
from
the
table
and
across
the
room
a
comet
with
a
destroying
black
tail
sheridan
shrieked
and
sprang
toward
it
it
lay
he
shouted
fiercely
it
lay
and
weeping
she
obeyed
sir
he
went
on
in
a
voice
the
more
ominous
for
the
sudden
hush

put
upon
it

interposed
gurney
sheridan
tell
me
that
bibbs
warned
you
edith

marry
lamhorn
in
new
york
sheridan
went
completely
to
pieces
he
swore
while
his
wife
screamed
and
stopped
her
ears
and
as
he
swore
he
pounded
the
table
with
his
wounded
hand
and
when
the
doctor
after
storming
at
him
ineffectively
sprang
to
catch
and
protect
that
hand
sheridan
wrenched
it
away
tearing
the
bandage
he
hammered
the
table
till
it
leaped
he
panted
choking
he
shown
gumption
enough
to
guess
right
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
enough
for
me
to
begin
him
on
and
struggling
with
the
doctor
he
leaned
toward
bibbs
thrusting
forward
his
convulsed
face
which
was
deathly
pale
name
ai
tracy
i
tell
you
he
screamed
hoarsely
give
in
you
stubborn
fool
i
had
my
way
with
you
before
and
i
have
my
way
with
you
now
bibbs
face
was
as
white
as
his
father
but
he
kept
remembering
that
of
mary
which
he
had
told
her
would
give
him
courage
in
a
struggle
so
that
he
would
give
you
ca
have
your
way
he
said
and
then
obeying
a
significant
motion
of
gurney
head
he
went
out
quickly
leaving

struggling
chapter
xxvii
sheridan
in
a
wrapper
noiselessly
opened
the
door
of
her
husband
room
at
daybreak
the
next
morning
and
peered
within
the
darkened
chamber
at
the
house
they
had
shared
a
room
but
the
architect
had
chosen
to
separate
them
at
the
new
and
they
had
not
known
how
to
formulate
an
objection
although
to
both
of
them
something
seemed
vaguely
reprehensible
in
the
new
arrangement
sheridan
did
not
stir
and
she
was
withdrawing
her
head
from
the
aperture
when
he
spoke
i
awake
come
in
if
you
want
to
and
shut
the
she
came
and
sat
by
the
bed
woke
up
thinkin
about
it
she
explained
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
surer
i
got
i
must
be
right
and
i
knew
you
be
tormentin
yourself
if
you
was
awake
so
well
you
got
plenty
other
troubles
but
i
just
sure
you
goin
to
have
the
worry
with
bibbs
it
looks
bet
i
ai
he
grunted
how
biddable
he
was
about
goin
back
to
the
works
she
continued
a
right
boy
really
and
sometimes
i
honestly
have
to
say
he
seems
right
smart
too
now
and
then
he
say
something
sounds
right
bright
most
always
it
does
and
a
good
deal
of
the
time
when
he
says
things
why
i
have
to
feel
glad
we
have
got
company
because
they
think
he
did
have
any
gumption
at
all
yet
look
at
the
way
he
did
when
jim
when
jim
got
hurt
he
took
right
hold
o
things
he
been
sick
himself
so
much
and
all
and
the
rest
of
us
never
had
much
and
we
were
kind
o
green
about
what
to
do
in
that
kind
o
trouble
still
he
did
take
hold
and
everything
went
off
all
right
you
have
to
say
that
much
papa
and
gurney
says
got
brains
and
you
ca
deny
but
what
the
doctor
right
considerable
of
a
man
he
acts
sleepy
but
that
only
because
he
got
such
a
large
practice
he
a
pretty
kind
of
a
man
some
ways
well
what
he
says
last
night
about
bibbs
himself
bein
asleep
and
how
much
amount
to
if
he
ever
woke
up
that
what
i
got
to
thinkin
about
you
heard
him
papa
he
says
be
a
bigger
business
man
than
what
jim
and
roscoe
was
put
together
if
he
ever
wakes
up
he
says
that
exactly
what
he
says
suppose
so
said
sheridan
without
exhibiting
any
interest
bibbs
but
if
he
was
if
what
he
says
was
true
what
of
it
papa
just
suppose
bibbs
took
it
into
his
mind
to
get
married
you
know
where
he
goes
all
the
time
lord
yes
sheridan
turned
over
in
the
bed
his
face
to
the
wall
leaving
visible
of
himself
only
the
thick
grizzle
of
his
hair
better
go
back
to
sleep
he
runs
over
there
every
minute
she
let
him
i
suppose
go
back
to
bed
there
nothin
in
ai
there
she
urged
know
better
there
is
too
you
wait
and
see
there
just
one
thing
in
the
world
that
wake
the
sleepiest
young
man
alive
up
yes
and
make
him
jump
up
and
i
do
care
who
he
is
or
how
sound
asleep
it
looks
like
he
is
that
when
he
takes
it
into
his
head
to
pick
out
some
girl
and
settle
down
and
have
a
home
and
chuldern
of
his
own
then
i
guess
he
go
out
after
the
money
see
i
known
dozens
o
cases
and
so
you
moony
young
men
all
notions
and
talk
goin
to
be
ministers
maybe
or
something
and
there
just
this
one
thing
takes
it
out
of
and
brings
right
down
to
business
well
i
never
could
make
out
just
what
it
is
bibbs
wants
to
be
really
does
seem
he
wants
to
be
a
minister
exactly
he
so
you
ca
tell
and
he
never
says
but
i
know
this
is
goin
to
get
him
right
down
to
common
sense
now
i
do
say
that
bibbs
has
got
the
idea
in
his
head
yet
else
he
would
be
talkin
that
about
nine
dollars
a
week
bein
good
enough
for
him
to
live
on
but
it
comin
papa
and
he
jump
for
whatever
you
want
to
hand
him
out
he
will
and
i
can
tell
you
this
much
too
want
all
the
salary
and
stock
he
can
get
hold
of
and
he
hustle
to
keep
gettin
more
that
girl
the
kind
that
a
young
husband
just
goes
crazy
to
give
things
to
she
pretty
and
and
things
look
nice
on
her
and
i
guess
she
like
to
have
about
as
well
as
the
next
and
i
guess
she
is
gettin
many
these
days
either
and
be
pretty
ready
for
the
change
i
saw
her
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
at
the
kitchen
window
the
other
day
and
jackson
told
me
yesterday
their
cook
left
two
weeks
ago
and
they
have
tried
to
hire
another
one
he
says
her
and
her
mother
been
doin
the
housework
a
good
while
and
now
they
doin
the
cookin
too
bibbs
would
know
that
unless
she
told
him
and
i
reckon
she
would
she
kind
and
bibbs
is
too
up
in
the
clouds
to
notice
anything
like
that
for
himself
they
never
asked
him
to
a
meal
in
the
house
but
he
would
notice
that
either
he
kind
of
innocent
now
i
was
thinkin
you
know
i
do
suppose
we
hardly
mentioned
the
name
at
table
since
jim
went
but
it
seems
to
me
maybe
if
sheridan
flung
out
his
arms
uttering
a
sound
barkin
up
the
wrong
tree
go
on
back
to
bed
mamma
am
i
she
demanded
crossly
am
i
barkin
up
the
wrong
tree
you
are
there
nothin
in
bet
you
she
said
rising
bet
you
he
goes
to
church
with
her
this
morning
what
you
want
to
bet
back
to
bed
he
commanded
know
what
i
talkin
about
nothin
in
it
i
tell
she
shook
her
head
perplexedly
think
because
because
jim
was
runnin
so
much
with
her
it
would
look
right
nothin
to
do
with
do
you
know
something
about
it
that
you
ai
told
me
i
do
he
grunted
go
on
maybe
i
can
get
a
little
sleep
i
ai
had
any
yet
she
went
to
the
door
her
expression
downcast
thought
maybe
but
she
coughed
prefatorily
papa
something
else
i
wanted
to
tell
you
i
was
talkin
to
roscoe
over
the
last
night
when
the
telegram
came
so
i
forgot
to
tell
you
but
well
sibyl
wants
to
come
over
this
afternoon
roscoe
says
she
has
something
she
wants
to
say
to
us
it
be
the
first
time
she
been
out
since
she
was
able
to
sit
up
and
i
reckon
she
wants
to
tell
us
she
sorry
for
what
happened
they
expect
to
get
off
by
the
end
o
the
week
and
i
reckon
she
wants
to
feel
she
done
what
she
could
to
kind
o
make
up
anyway
what
he
said
i
him
again
about
edith
and
he
said
it
disturb
sibyl
because
she
been
expectin
it
she
was
sure
all
along
it
was
goin
to
happen
and
besides
i
guess
she
got
all
that
foolishness
pretty
much
out
of
her
bein
so
sick
but
what
i
thought
was
no
use
bein
rough
with
her
papa
i
expect
she
suffered
a
good
deal
and
i
do
think
we
ought
to
be
on
roscoe
account
you
you
be
kind
o
polite
to
her
wo
you
papa
he
mumbled
something
which
was
smothered
under
the
coverlet
he
had
pulled
over
his
head
she
said
timidly
was
just
sayin
i
hoped
you
treat
sibyl
all
right
when
she
comes
this
afternoon
you
will
wo
you
papa
he
threw
the
coverlet
off
furiously
presume
so
he
roared
she
departed
guiltily
but
if
he
had
accepted
her
proffered
wager
that
bibbs
would
go
to
church
with
mary
vertrees
that
morning
sheridan
would
have
lost
nevertheless
bibbs
and
mary
did
certainly
set
out
from
house
with
the
purpose
of
going
to
church
that
was
their
intention
and
they
had
no
other
they
meant
to
go
to
church
but
it
happened
that
they
were
attentively
preoccupied
in
a
conversation
as
they
came
to
the
church
and
though
mary
was
looking
to
the
right
and
bibbs
was
looking
to
the
left
bibbs
leftward
glance
converged
with
mary
rightward
glance
and
neither
was
looking
far
beyond
the
other
at
this
time
it
also
happened
that
though
they
were
a
little
jostled
among
groups
of
people
in
the
vicinity
of
the
church
they
passed
this
somewhat
prominent
edifice
without
being
aware
of
their
proximity
to
it
and
they
had
gone
an
incredible
number
of
blocks
beyond
it
before
they
discovered
their
error
however
feeling
that
they
might
be
embarrassingly
late
if
they
returned
they
decided
that
a
walk
would
make
them
as
good
it
was
a
windless
winter
morning
with
an
inch
of
crisp
snow
over
the
ground
so
they
walked
and
for
the
most
part
they
were
silent
but
on
their
way
home
after
they
had
turned
back
at
noon
they
began
to
be
talkative
again
said
bibbs
after
a
time
i
a
she
laughed
a
little
then
looked
grave
your
father
say
you
are
when
he
in
a
mood
to
flatter
me
other
times
other
names
he
has
quite
a
must
mind
she
said
gently
been
getting
some
pretty
severe
shocks
what
you
told
me
makes
me
pretty
sorry
for
him
bibbs
i
always
been
sure
he
very
big
and
blind
he
like
a
hercules
without
eyes
and
without
any
consciousness
except
that
of
his
strength
and
of
his
purpose
to
grow
stronger
stronger
for
what
for
you
sure
bibbs
it
ca
be
for
nothing
it
must
be
stronger
for
something
even
though
he
does
know
what
it
is
perhaps
what
he
and
his
kind
are
struggling
for
is
something
so
great
they
could
see
it
so
great
none
of
us
could
see
he
just
like
some
blind
unconscious
thing
heaving
underground
he
breaks
through
and
leaps
out
into
the
daylight
she
finished
for
him
cheerily
the
smoke
said
bibbs
at
the
powder
of
already
dirtying
the
decent
snow
even
though
it
sunday
that
from
the
little
pigs
the
big
ones
are
so
bad
on
sunday
there
a
fleck
of
soot
on
your
cheek
some
pig
sent
it
out
into
the
air
he
might
as
well
have
thrown
it
on
you
it
would
have
been
braver
for
then
he
have
taken
his
chance
of
my
whipping
him
for
it
if
i
there
soot
on
my
cheek
bibbs
or
were
you
only
saying
so
rhetorically
is
there
there
there
are
soot
on
your
cheeks
mary
a
fleck
on
each
one
landed
since
i
mentioned
the
she
halted
immediately
giving
him
her
handkerchief
and
he
succeeded
in
transferring
most
of
the
black
from
her
face
to
the
cambric
they
were
entirely
about
it
an
elderly
couple
it
chanced
had
been
walking
behind
bibbs
and
mary
for
the
last
block
or
so
and
passed
ahead
during
the
removal
of
the
soot
said
the
elderly
wife
always
wrong
when
you
begin
guessing
about
strangers
those
two
young
people
honeymooners
at
all
they
been
married
for
years
a
blind
man
could
see
wish
i
did
know
who
threw
that
soot
on
you
said
bibbs
looking
up
at
the
neighboring
chimneys
as
they
went
on
arrest
children
for
throwing
snowballs
at
the
but
they
do
arrest
the
for
shaking
all
the
pictures
in
the
houses
crooked
every
time
they
go
by
nor
for
the
uproar
they
make
i
wonder
what
the
cost
in
nerves
for
the
noise
of
the
city
each
year
yes
we
pay
the
price
for
living
in
a
town
whether
we
have
money
to
pay
or
is
it
gets
the
pay
said
bibbs
i
she
laughed
gets
it
there
is
any
pay
there
only
money
and
only
some
of
the
men
get
much
of
that
that
what
my
father
wants
me
to
she
said
smiling
to
him
and
nodding
you
do
want
it
and
you
do
need
you
do
think
i
a
mary
he
had
told
her
of
his
father
new
plans
for
him
though
he
had
not
described
the
vigor
and
picturesqueness
of
their
setting
forth
think
i
right
thousand
times
she
cried
are
so
many
happy
people
in
this
world
i
think
and
you
say
you
found
what
makes
you
happy
if
it
a
dream
keep
it
thought
of
going
down
there
into
the
money
shuffle
i
hate
it
as
i
never
hated
the
shop
he
said
hate
it
and
the
city
itself
the
city
that
the
money
shuffle
has
made
just
look
at
it
look
at
it
in
winter
the
snow
tried
hard
to
make
the
ugliness
bearable
but
the
ugliness
is
winning
it
making
the
snow
hideous
the
snow
getting
dirty
on
top
and
it
foul
underneath
with
the
dirt
and
disease
of
the
unclean
street
and
the
dirt
and
the
ugliness
and
the
rush
and
the
noise
are
the
worst
of
it
it
what
the
dirt
and
ugliness
and
rush
and
noise
mean
that
the
worst
the
outward
things
are
insufferable
but
they
only
the
expression
of
a
spirit
a
blind
embryo
of
a
spirit
not
yet
a
soul
oh
just
greed
and
this
ahead
nonsense
ought
it
all
to
be
a
fellowship
i
should
want
to
get
ahead
if
i
could
want
to
help
the
other
fellow
to
keep
up
with
read
something
the
other
day
and
remembered
it
for
you
said
mary
was
something
said
of
a
picture
he
was
going
to
paint
the
first
picture
i
shall
make
a
man
walking
in
the
street
of
a
great
city
full
of
all
kinds
of
happy
life
children
and
lovers
walking
and
ladies
leaning
from
the
windows
all
down
great
lengths
of
a
street
leading
to
the
city
walls
and
there
the
gates
are
wide
open
letting
in
a
space
of
green
field
and
cornfield
in
harvest
and
all
round
his
head
a
great
rain
of
swirling
autumn
leaves
blowing
from
a
little
walled
if
i
painted
bibbs
returned
paint
a
lady
walking
in
the
street
of
a
great
city
full
of
all
kinds
of
uproarious
and
futile
life
children
being
taught
only
how
to
make
money
and
lovers
hurrying
to
get
richer
and
ladies
who
given
up
trying
to
wash
their
windows
clean
and
the
gates
of
the
city
wide
open
letting
in
slums
and
and
and
all
round
this
lady
head
a
great
rain
of
swirling
soot
he
paused
adding
thoughtfully
yet
i
believe
i
glad
that
soot
got
on
your
cheek
it
was
just
as
if
i
were
your
brother
the
way
you
gave
me
your
handkerchief
to
rub
it
off
for
you
still
edith
never
she
said
mary
as
he
paused
again
and
i
he
contented
himself
with
shaking
his
head
instead
of
offering
more
definite
information
then
he
realized
that
they
were
passing
the
new
house
and
he
sighed
profoundly
our
almost
she
looked
as
blank
it
is
they
said
no
more
until
they
came
to
her
gate
as
they
drifted
slowly
to
a
stop
the
door
of
roscoe
house
opened
and
roscoe
came
out
with
sibyl
who
was
startlingly
pale
she
seemed
little
enfeebled
by
her
illness
however
walking
rather
quickly
at
her
husband
side
and
not
taking
his
arm
the
two
crossed
the
street
without
appearing
to
see
mary
and
her
companion
and
entering
the
new
house
were
lost
to
sight
mary
gazed
after
them
gravely
but
bibbs
looking
at
mary
did
not
see
them
he
said
seem
very
serious
is
anything
bothering
you
and
she
gave
him
a
bright
quick
look
that
made
him
instantly
unreasonably
happy
know
you
want
to
go
in
he
began
i
do
want
must
keep
you
standing
here
and
i
must
go
in
with
you
but
i
just
wanted
to
say
i
seemed
very
stupid
to
myself
this
morning
grumbling
about
soot
and
all
that
while
all
the
time
i
mary
i
think
it
been
the
very
happiest
of
all
the
hours
you
given
me
i
do
and
i
do
know
just
why
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
one
always
remember
and
you
he
added
falteringly
look
so
so
beautiful
must
have
been
the
soot
on
my
cheek
will
you
tell
me
something
he
asked
think
i
something
i
had
a
lot
of
theories
about
but
none
of
them
ever
just
fits
you
used
to
wear
furs
in
the
fall
but
now
it
so
much
colder
you
do
you
never
wear
them
at
all
any
more
why
do
you
her
eyes
fell
for
a
moment
and
she
grew
red
then
she
looked
up
gaily
if
i
tell
you
the
answer
will
you
promise
not
to
ask
any
more
questions
why
did
you
stop
wearing
them
i
found
i
be
warmer
without
them
she
caught
his
hand
quickly
in
her
own
for
an
instant
laughed
into
his
eyes
and
ran
into
the
house
chapter
xxviii
it
is
the
consoling
attribute
of
unused
books
that
their
decorative
warmth
will
so
often
make
even
a
library
the
actual
of
a
family
to
whom
the
shelved
volumes
are
indeed
sealed
thus
it
was
with
sheridan
who
read
nothing
except
newspapers
business
letters
and
figures
who
looked
upon
books
as
he
looked
upon
or
crocheting
when
he
was
at
home
and
not
abed
or
eating
he
was
in
the
library
he
stood
in
the
light
of
the
window
at
the
far
end
of
the
long
room
when
roscoe
and
his
wife
came
in
and
he
exhaled
a
solemnity
his
deference
to
the
sabbath
was
manifest
as
always
in
the
length
of
his
coat
and
the
closeness
of
his
shave
and
his
expression
to
match
this
religious
pomp
was
more
than
sabbatical
but
the
most
dismaying
of
his
demonstrations
was
his
keeping
his
hand
in
his
sling
sibyl
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
halted
there
not
looking
at
him
but
down
at
her
muff
in
which
it
could
be
seen
her
hands
were
nervously
moving
roscoe
went
to
a
chair
in
another
part
of
the
room
there
was
a
deadly
silence
but
sibyl
found
a
shaky
voice
after
an
interval
of
gulping
though
she
was
unable
to
lift
her
eyes
and
the
darkling
lids
continued
to
veil
them
she
spoke
hurriedly
like
an
ungifted
child
reciting
something
committed
to
memory
but
her
sincerity
was
none
the
less
evident
for
that
sheridan
you
and
mother
sheridan
have
always
been
so
kind
to
me
and
i
would
hate
to
have
you
think
i
do
appreciate
it
from
the
way
i
acted
i
come
to
tell
you
i
am
sorry
for
the
way
i
did
that
night
and
to
say
i
know
as
well
as
anybody
the
way
i
behaved
and
it
will
never
happen
again
because
it
been
a
pretty
hard
lesson
and
when
we
come
back
some
day
i
hope
you
see
that
you
got
a
you
never
need
to
be
ashamed
of
again
i
want
to
ask
you
to
excuse
me
for
the
way
i
did
and
i
can
say
i
have
any
feelings
toward
edith
now
but
only
wish
her
happiness
and
good
in
her
new
life
i
thank
you
for
all
your
kindness
to
me
and
i
know
i
made
a
poor
return
for
it
but
if
you
can
overlook
the
way
i
behaved
i
know
i
would
feel
a
good
deal
happier
and
i
know
roscoe
would
too
i
wish
to
promise
not
to
be
as
foolish
in
the
future
and
the
same
error
would
never
occur
again
to
make
us
all
so
unhappy
if
you
can
be
charitable
enough
to
excuse
it
this
he
looked
steadily
at
her
without
replying
and
she
stood
before
him
never
lifting
her
eyes
motionless
save
where
the
moving
fur
proved
the
agitation
of
her
hands
within
the
muff
right
he
said
at
last
she
looked
up
then
with
vast
relief
though
there
was
a
revelation
of
heavy
tears
when
the
eyelids
lifted
you
she
said
something
else
about
something
different
i
want
to
say
to
you
but
i
want
mother
sheridan
to
hear
it
in
her
room
said
sheridan
sibyl
interrupted
she
had
just
seen
bibbs
pass
through
the
hall
and
begin
to
ascend
the
stairs
and
in
a
flash
she
instinctively
perceived
the
chance
for
precisely
the
effect
she
wanted
let
me
go
she
said
want
to
speak
to
her
a
minute
first
and
she
went
away
quickly
gaining
the
top
of
the
stairs
in
time
to
see
bibbs
enter
his
room
and
close
the
door
sibyl
knew
that
bibbs
in
his
room
had
overheard
her
quarrel
with
edith
in
the
hall
outside
for
bitter
edith
thinking
the
more
to
shame
her
had
subsequently
informed
her
of
the
circumstance
sibyl
had
just
remembered
this
and
with
the
recollection
there
had
flashed
the
thought
out
of
her
own
experience
that
people
are
often
much
more
deeply
impressed
by
words
they
overhear
than
by
words
directly
addressed
to
them
sibyl
intended
to
make
it
impossible
for
bibbs
not
to
overhear
she
did
not
hesitate
her
heart
was
hot
with
the
old
sore
and
she
believed
wholly
in
the
justice
of
her
cause
and
in
the
truth
of
what
she
was
going
to
say
fate
was
virtuous
at
times
it
had
delivered
into
her
hands
the
girl
who
had
affronted
her
sheridan
was
in
her
own
room
the
approach
of
sibyl
and
roscoe
had
driven
her
from
the
library
for
she
had
miscalculated
her
mood
and
she
felt
that
if
he
used
his
injured
hand
as
a
mark
of
emphasis
again
in
her
presence
she
would
as
she
thought
of
it
a
fit
right
she
heard
sibyl
step
and
pretended
to
be
putting
a
touch
to
her
hair
before
a
mirror
was
just
coming
down
she
said
as
the
door
opened
he
wants
you
to
said
sibyl
all
right
mother
sheridan
he
forgiven
sheridan
sniffed
instantly
tears
appeared
she
kissed
her
cheek
then
in
silence
regarded
the
mirror
afresh
wiped
her
eyes
and
applied
powder
i
hope
edith
will
be
happy
sibyl
added
inciting
more
applications
of
sheridan
handkerchief
and
powder
yes
murmured
the
good
woman
must
make
the
worst
of
there
was
something
else
i
had
to
say
and
he
wants
you
to
hear
it
too
said
sibyl
better
go
down
mother
she
led
the
way
sheridan
following
obediently
but
when
they
came
to
a
spot
close
by
bibbs
door
sibyl
stopped
want
to
tell
you
about
it
first
she
said
abruptly
is
a
secret
of
course
in
any
way
it
something
the
whole
family
has
to
know
and
the
sooner
the
whole
family
knows
it
the
better
it
something
it
would
be
right
for
us
all
not
to
understand
and
of
course
father
sheridan
most
of
all
but
i
want
to
just
kind
of
go
over
it
first
with
you
it
kind
of
help
me
to
see
i
got
it
all
straight
i
have
got
any
reason
for
saying
it
except
the
good
of
the
family
and
it
nothing
to
me
one
way
or
the
other
of
course
except
for
that
i
ought
to
behaved
the
way
i
did
that
night
and
it
seems
to
me
if
there
anything
i
can
do
to
help
the
family
i
ought
to
because
it
would
help
show
i
felt
the
right
way
well
what
i
want
to
do
is
to
tell
this
so
to
keep
the
family
from
being
made
a
fool
of
i
do
want
to
see
the
family
just
made
use
of
and
twisted
around
her
finger
by
somebody
that
got
no
more
heart
than
so
much
ice
and
just
as
sure
to
bring
troubles
in
the
long
run
as
as
edith
mistake
is
well
then
this
is
the
way
it
is
i
just
tell
you
how
it
looks
to
me
and
see
if
it
do
strike
you
the
same
within
the
room
bibbs
much
annoyed
tapped
his
ear
with
his
pencil
he
wished
they
would
stand
talking
near
his
door
when
he
was
trying
to
write
he
had
just
taken
from
his
trunk
the
manuscript
of
a
poem
begun
the
preceding
sunday
afternoon
and
he
had
some
ideas
he
wanted
to
fix
upon
paper
before
they
maliciously
seized
the
first
opportunity
to
vanish
for
they
were
but
gossamer
bibbs
was
pleased
with
the
beginnings
of
his
poem
and
if
he
could
carry
it
through
he
meant
to
dare
greatly
with
it
he
would
venture
it
upon
an
editor
for
he
had
his
plan
of
life
now
his
day
would
be
of
manual
labor
and
thinking
he
could
think
of
his
friend
and
he
could
think
in
cadences
for
poems
to
the
crashing
of
the
strong
machine
and
if
his
father
turned
him
out
of
home
and
out
of
the
works
he
would
work
elsewhere
and
live
elsewhere
his
father
had
the
right
and
it
mattered
very
little
to
bibbs
he
faced
the
prospect
of
a
without
trepidation
he
could
find
a
washstand
to
write
upon
he
thought
and
every
evening
when
he
left
mary
he
would
write
a
little
and
he
would
write
on
holidays
and
on
sundays
on
sundays
in
the
afternoon
in
a
at
least
he
would
be
interrupted
by
his
choosing
the
immediate
vicinity
of
his
door
for
conversations
evidently
important
to
herself
but
merely
disturbing
to
him
he
frowned
plaintively
wishing
he
could
think
of
some
polite
way
of
asking
her
to
go
away
but
as
she
went
on
he
started
violently
dropping
manuscript
and
pencil
upon
the
floor
do
know
whether
you
heard
it
mother
sheridan
she
said
this
old
vertrees
house
next
door
had
been
sold
on
foreclosure
and
all
they
got
out
of
it
was
an
agreement
that
let
live
there
a
little
longer
roscoe
told
me
and
he
says
he
heard
vertrees
has
been
up
and
down
the
streets
more
two
years
tryin
to
get
a
job
he
could
call
a
and
could
land
it
you
heard
anything
about
it
mother
sheridan
i
did
know
they
been
doin
their
own
a
good
while
back
said
sheridan
now
they
doin
the
cookin
sibyl
sent
forth
a
little
titter
with
a
sharp
edge
hope
they
find
something
to
cook
she
sold
her
piano
mighty
quick
after
jim
died
bibbs
jumped
up
he
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
and
he
was
dizzy
of
all
the
real
things
he
could
never
have
dreamed
in
his
dream
the
last
would
have
been
what
he
heard
now
he
felt
that
something
incredible
was
happening
and
that
he
was
powerless
to
stop
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
heavy
blows
were
falling
on
his
head
and
upon
mary
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
and
mary
were
being
struck
and
beaten
physically
and
that
something
hideous
impended
he
wanted
to
shout
to
sibyl
to
be
silent
but
he
could
not
he
could
only
stand
swallowing
and
trembling
i
think
the
whole
family
ought
to
understand
is
just
this
said
sibyl
sharply
people
were
so
hard
up
that
this
miss
vertrees
started
after
bibbs
before
they
knew
whether
he
was
insane
or
not
they
got
a
notion
he
might
be
from
his
being
in
a
sanitarium
and
vertrees
asked
me
if
he
was
insane
the
very
first
day
bibbs
took
the
daughter
out
she
paused
a
moment
looking
at
sheridan
but
listening
intently
there
was
no
sound
from
within
the
room
exclaimed
sheridan
the
truth
sibyl
declared
loudly
of
course
we
were
all
crazy
about
that
girl
at
first
we
were
pretty
green
when
we
moved
up
here
and
we
thought
she
get
us
in
but
it
did
take
me
long
to
read
her
her
family
were
down
and
out
when
it
came
to
money
and
they
had
to
go
after
it
one
way
or
another
somehow
so
she
started
for
roscoe
but
she
found
out
pretty
quick
he
was
married
and
she
turned
right
around
to
jim
and
she
landed
him
there
no
doubt
about
it
she
had
jim
and
if
he
lived
you
had
another
before
this
as
sure
as
i
stand
here
telling
you
the
god
truth
about
it
well
when
jim
was
left
in
the
cemetery
she
was
waiting
out
there
to
drive
home
with
bibbs
jim
was
cold
and
she
did
know
whether
bibbs
was
insane
or
not
but
he
was
the
only
one
of
the
rich
sheridan
boys
left
she
had
to
get
the
texture
of
what
was
the
truth
made
an
even
fabric
with
what
was
not
in
sibyl
mind
she
believed
every
word
that
she
uttered
and
she
spoke
with
the
rapidity
and
vehemence
of
fierce
conviction
i
feel
about
it
is
she
said
ought
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
it
too
mean
i
like
poor
bibbs
and
i
do
want
to
see
him
made
such
a
fool
of
and
i
do
want
to
see
the
family
made
such
a
fool
of
i
like
poor
bibbs
but
if
he
only
stop
to
think
a
minute
himself
have
to
realize
he
is
the
kind
of
man
any
girl
would
be
apt
to
fall
in
love
with
he
lately
maybe
but
you
know
how
he
was
just
kind
of
a
long
white
rag
in
good
clothes
and
girls
like
men
with
some
go
to
some
sort
of
dashingness
anyhow
nobody
ever
looked
at
poor
bibbs
before
and
neither
she
no
sir
not
till
tried
both
roscoe
and
jim
first
it
was
only
when
her
and
her
family
got
desperate
that
she
bibbs
whiter
than
when
he
came
from
the
sanitarium
opened
the
door
he
stepped
across
its
threshold
and
stook
looking
at
her
both
women
screamed
good
heavens
cried
sibyl
you
in
there
oh
i
would
she
seized
sheridan
arm
pulling
her
toward
the
stairway
on
mother
sheridan
she
urged
and
as
the
befuddled
and
confused
lady
obeyed
sibyl
left
a
trail
of
noisy
exclamations
gracious
oh
i
would
too
bad
i
did
dream
he
was
there
i
would
hurt
his
feelings
not
for
the
world
of
course
he
had
to
know
some
time
but
good
heavens
she
heard
his
door
close
as
she
and
sheridan
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
quickly
but
bibbs
was
not
following
he
had
gone
back
into
his
room
he
looked
oh
terrible
bad
stammered
sheridan
i
wish
it
a
good
deal
better
he
knows
about
it
said
sibyl
should
wonder
it
might
turn
out
the
very
best
thing
could
happened
come
on
and
completing
their
descent
to
the
library
the
two
made
their
appearance
to
roscoe
and
his
father
sibyl
at
once
gave
a
full
and
truthful
account
of
what
had
taken
place
repeating
her
own
remarks
and
omitting
only
the
fact
that
it
was
through
her
design
that
bibbs
had
overheard
them
as
i
told
mother
sheridan
she
said
in
conclusion
might
turn
out
for
the
very
best
that
he
did
hear
just
that
way
do
you
think
so
father
sheridan
he
merely
grunted
in
reply
and
sat
rubbing
the
thick
hair
on
the
top
of
his
head
with
his
left
hand
and
looking
at
the
fire
he
had
given
no
sign
of
being
impressed
in
any
manner
by
her
exposure
of
mary
character
but
his
impassivity
did
not
dismay
sibyl
it
was
bibbs
whom
she
desired
to
impress
and
she
was
content
in
that
matter
sure
it
was
all
for
the
best
she
said
over
now
and
he
knows
what
she
is
in
one
way
i
think
it
was
lucky
because
just
hearing
a
thing
that
way
a
person
can
tell
it
so
and
he
knows
i
have
got
any
ax
to
grind
except
his
own
good
and
the
good
of
the
sheridan
went
nervously
to
the
door
and
stood
there
looking
toward
the
stairway
wish
i
wish
i
knew
what
he
was
doin
she
said
did
look
terrible
bad
it
was
like
something
had
been
done
to
him
that
was
i
do
know
what
i
never
saw
anybody
look
like
he
did
he
looked
so
queer
it
was
like
you
she
called
down
the
hall
you
up
in
bibbs
room
just
now
he
ring
bell
tole
me
make
him
fiah
in
his
grate
i
done
him
nice
fiah
i
reckon
he
ain
feelin
so
well
he
departed
do
you
expect
he
wants
a
fire
for
she
asked
turning
toward
her
husband
house
is
warm
as
can
be
i
do
wish
i
quit
frettin
said
sheridan
i
i
kind
o
wish
you
had
said
anything
sibyl
i
know
you
meant
it
for
the
best
and
all
but
i
do
believe
it
would
been
so
much
harm
if
sheridan
you
do
mean
you
want
that
kind
of
a
girl
in
the
family
why
she
do
know
i
do
know
the
troubled
woman
quavered
he
liked
her
it
seems
kind
of
a
pity
to
spoil
it
he
so
queer
and
he
ever
taken
much
enjoyment
and
besides
i
believe
the
way
it
was
there
was
more
chance
of
him
bein
willin
to
do
what
papa
wants
him
to
if
she
wants
to
marry
him
sheridan
interrupted
her
with
a
hooting
laugh
do
he
said
barkin
up
the
wrong
tree
sibyl
she
ai
that
kind
of
a
father
sheridan
did
she
he
cut
her
short
enough
you
may
mean
all
right
but
you
guess
wrong
so
do
you
sibyl
cried
out
but
just
look
how
she
ran
after
jim
did
not
he
said
curtly
would
take
jim
she
turned
him
down
that
impossi
not
i
know
she
sibyl
looked
flatly
incredulous
you
need
worry
he
said
turning
to
his
wife
wo
have
any
effect
on
your
idea
because
there
was
any
sense
to
it
anyhow
think
she
be
very
likely
to
take
bibbs
after
she
would
take
jim
she
a
girl
and
she
lets
bibbs
come
to
see
her
but
if
she
ever
given
him
one
sign
of
encouragement
the
way
you
women
think
he
would
of
acted
the
stubborn
fool
he
has
he
been
at
me
long
ago
beggin
me
for
some
kind
of
a
job
he
could
support
a
wife
on
there
nothin
in
it
and
i
got
the
same
old
fight
with
him
on
my
hands
i
had
all
his
life
and
the
lord
knows
what
he
wo
do
to
balk
me
what
happened
now
probably
only
make
him
twice
as
stubborn
but
sheridan
still
in
the
doorway
lifted
her
hand
his
step
he
comin
she
shrank
away
from
the
door
as
if
she
feared
to
have
bibbs
see
her
i
wonder
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
wonder
what
he
goin
to
her
timorousness
had
its
effect
upon
the
others
sheridan
rose
frowning
but
remained
standing
beside
his
chair
and
roscoe
moved
toward
sibyl
who
stared
uneasily
at
the
open
doorway
they
listened
as
the
slow
steps
descended
the
stairs
and
came
toward
the
library
bibbs
stopped
upon
the
threshold
and
with
sick
and
haggard
eyes
looked
slowly
from
one
to
the
other
until
at
last
his
gaze
rested
upon
his
father
then
he
came
and
stood
before
him
sorry
you
had
so
much
trouble
with
me
he
said
gently
wo
any
more
i
take
the
job
you
offered
sheridan
did
not
speak
he
stared
astounded
and
incredulous
and
bibbs
had
left
the
room
before
any
of
its
occupants
uttered
a
sound
though
he
went
as
slowly
as
he
came
sheridan
was
the
first
to
move
she
went
nervously
back
to
the
doorway
and
then
out
into
the
hall
bibbs
had
gone
from
the
house
bibbs
mother
had
a
feeling
about
him
then
that
she
had
never
known
before
it
was
indefinite
and
vague
but
very
poignant
something
in
her
mourned
for
him
uncomprehendingly
she
felt
that
an
awful
thing
had
been
done
to
him
though
she
did
not
know
what
it
was
she
went
up
to
his
room
the
fire
george
had
built
for
him
was
almost
smothered
under
thick
charred
ashes
of
paper
the
lid
of
his
trunk
stood
open
and
the
large
upper
tray
which
she
remembered
to
have
seen
full
of
papers
and
was
empty
and
somehow
she
understood
that
bibbs
had
given
up
the
mysterious
vocation
he
had
hoped
to
follow
and
that
he
had
given
it
up
for
ever
she
thought
it
was
the
wisest
thing
he
could
have
done
and
yet
for
an
unknown
reason
she
sat
upon
the
bed
and
wept
a
little
before
she
went
so
sheridan
had
his
way
with
bibbs
all
through
chapter
xxix
as
bibbs
came
out
of
the
new
house
a
sunday
trio
was
in
course
of
passage
upon
the
sidewalk
an
ample
young
woman
placid
of
face
a
thin
young
man
whose
expression
was
one
of
habitual
anxiety
habitual
wariness
and
habitual
eagerness
he
propelled
a
perambulator
containing
the
third
and
all
three
were
newly
cleaned
sundayfied
and
made
fit
to
dine
with
the
wife
relatives
you
like
for
me
to
be
that
young
fella
mamma
the
husband
whispered
one
of
the
sons
and
there
ai
but
two
left
the
wife
stared
curiously
at
bibbs
i
do
know
she
returned
looks
to
me
like
he
had
his
own
expect
he
has
like
anybody
else
said
the
young
husband
i
guess
we
could
stand
a
good
deal
if
we
had
his
maybe
if
you
keep
on
the
way
you
been
baby
be
as
well
fixed
as
the
sheridans
you
ca
she
glanced
back
at
bibbs
who
had
turned
north
walks
kind
of
slow
and
stooped
over
much
money
in
his
pockets
it
makes
him
sag
i
guess
said
the
young
husband
with
bitter
admiration
mary
happening
to
glance
from
a
window
saw
bibbs
coming
and
she
started
clasping
her
hands
together
in
a
sudden
alarm
she
met
him
at
the
door
she
cried
is
the
matter
i
saw
something
was
terribly
wrong
when
i
you
look
she
paused
and
he
came
in
not
lifting
his
eyes
to
hers
always
when
he
crossed
that
threshold
he
had
come
with
his
head
up
and
his
wistful
gaze
seeking
hers
poor
boy
she
said
with
a
gesture
of
understanding
and
pity
know
what
it
is
he
followed
her
into
the
room
where
they
always
sat
and
sank
into
a
chair
need
tell
me
she
said
made
you
give
up
your
father
won
you
going
to
do
what
he
wants
you
given
still
without
looking
at
her
he
inclined
his
head
in
affirmation
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
compassion
and
came
and
sat
near
him
she
said
can
be
glad
of
one
thing
though
it
selfish
i
can
be
glad
you
came
straight
to
me
it
more
to
me
than
even
if
you
come
because
you
were
she
did
not
speak
again
for
a
little
while
then
she
said
dear
could
you
tell
me
about
it
do
you
want
to
still
he
did
not
look
up
but
in
a
voice
shaken
and
husky
he
asked
her
a
question
so
grotesque
that
at
first
she
thought
she
had
misunderstood
his
words
he
said
you
marry
me
did
you
say
bibbs
she
asked
quietly
his
tone
and
attitude
did
not
change
you
marry
me
both
of
her
hands
leaped
to
her
cheeks
she
grew
red
and
then
white
she
rose
slowly
and
moved
backward
from
him
staring
at
him
at
first
incredulously
then
with
an
intense
perplexity
more
and
more
luminous
in
her
wide
eyes
it
was
like
a
spoken
question
the
room
filled
with
strangeness
in
the
long
silence
the
two
were
so
strange
to
each
other
at
last
she
said
made
you
say
that
he
did
not
answer
look
at
me
her
voice
was
loud
and
clear
made
you
say
that
look
at
me
he
could
not
look
at
her
and
he
could
not
speak
was
it
that
made
you
she
said
want
you
to
tell
she
went
closer
to
him
her
eyes
ever
brighter
and
wider
with
that
intensity
of
wonder
given
up
to
your
father
she
said
slowly
then
you
came
to
ask
me
she
broke
off
do
you
want
me
to
marry
you
he
said
just
audibly
she
cried
do
not
then
what
made
you
ask
me
what
is
it
that
happened
she
said
me
think
it
something
that
happened
since
our
walk
this
morning
yes
since
you
left
me
at
noon
something
happened
that
she
stopped
abruptly
with
a
tremulous
murmur
of
amazement
and
dawning
comprehension
she
remembered
that
sibyl
had
gone
to
the
new
house
bibbs
swallowed
painfully
and
contrived
to
say
do
i
do
want
you
to
marry
me
if
if
you
she
looked
at
him
and
slowly
shook
her
head
do
you
her
voice
was
as
unsteady
as
his
little
more
than
a
whisper
you
think
i
in
love
with
you
he
said
somewhere
in
the
still
air
of
the
room
there
was
a
whispered
word
it
did
not
seem
to
come
from
mary
parted
lips
but
he
was
aware
of
it
had
nothing
but
dreams
bibbs
said
desolately
they
like
that
sibyl
said
no
girl
could
care
about
he
smiled
faintly
though
still
he
did
not
look
at
mary
when
i
first
came
home
edith
told
me
sibyl
was
so
anxious
to
marry
that
she
have
married
me
she
meant
it
to
express
sibyl
extremity
you
see
but
i
hardly
needed
either
of
them
to
tell
me
i
had
thought
of
myself
as
well
not
as
particularly
captivating
oddly
enough
mary
pallor
changed
to
an
angry
flush
two
she
exclaimed
sharply
and
then
with
thoroughgoing
contempt
that
like
them
she
turned
away
went
to
the
bare
little
black
mantel
and
stood
leaning
upon
it
presently
she
asked
did
roscoe
sheridan
say
that
girl
could
care
about
you
mary
drew
a
deep
breath
think
i
beginning
to
understand
a
she
bit
her
lip
there
was
anger
in
good
truth
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
voice
me
once
more
she
said
do
you
know
now
why
i
stopped
wearing
my
furs
thought
so
your
told
you
did
she
i
heard
her
say
think
i
know
what
happened
mary
breath
came
fast
and
her
voice
shook
but
she
spoke
rapidly
her
say
more
than
that
you
her
say
that
we
were
bitterly
poor
and
on
that
account
i
tried
first
to
marry
your
brother
and
then
but
now
she
faltered
and
it
was
only
after
a
convulsive
effort
that
she
was
able
to
go
on
then
that
i
tried
to
marry
you
you
her
say
that
and
you
believe
that
i
do
care
for
you
and
that
girl
could
care
for
you
but
you
think
i
am
in
such
an
as
sibyl
was
that
you
and
so
not
wanting
me
and
believing
that
i
could
not
want
you
except
for
my
you
took
your
father
offer
and
then
came
to
ask
me
to
marry
you
what
had
i
shown
you
of
myself
that
could
make
you
suddenly
she
sank
down
kneeling
with
her
face
buried
in
her
arms
upon
the
lap
of
a
chair
tears
overwhelming
her
mary
he
cried
helplessly
no
you
you
do
do
though
she
sobbed
do
he
came
and
stood
beside
her
kill
me
he
said
ca
make
it
plain
from
the
first
of
your
loveliness
to
me
i
was
all
self
it
was
always
you
that
gave
and
i
that
took
i
was
the
dependent
i
did
nothing
but
lean
on
you
we
always
talked
of
me
not
of
you
it
was
all
about
my
idiotic
distresses
and
troubles
i
thought
of
you
as
a
kind
of
wonderful
being
that
had
no
mortal
or
human
suffering
except
by
sympathy
you
seemed
to
lean
down
out
of
a
rosy
cloud
to
be
kind
to
me
i
never
dreamed
i
could
do
anything
for
you
i
never
dreamed
you
could
need
anything
to
be
done
for
you
by
anybody
and
i
heard
that
that
you
heard
that
i
needed
to
marry
some
one
anybody
with
money
she
sobbed
you
thought
we
were
so
so
desperate
you
believed
that
i
had
he
said
quickly
did
believe
you
done
one
kind
thing
for
me
for
that
no
no
no
i
knew
you
never
thought
of
me
except
generously
to
give
i
said
i
could
make
it
plain
he
cried
despairingly
she
lifted
her
head
and
extended
her
hands
to
him
unconsciously
like
a
child
me
up
then
when
she
was
once
more
upon
her
feet
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
smiled
upon
him
ruefully
and
faintly
but
reassuringly
as
if
to
tell
him
in
that
way
that
she
knew
he
had
not
meant
to
hurt
her
and
that
smile
of
hers
so
lamentable
but
so
faithfully
friendly
misted
his
own
eyes
for
his
shamefacedness
lowered
them
no
more
me
tell
you
what
you
want
to
tell
me
she
said
ca
because
you
ca
put
it
into
words
they
are
too
humiliating
for
me
and
you
too
gentle
to
say
them
tell
me
though
is
it
true
you
did
believe
that
i
tried
to
make
you
fall
in
love
with
me
never
for
an
instant
did
believe
i
tried
to
make
you
want
to
marry
me
no
no
believe
it
bibbs
you
thought
that
i
was
fond
of
you
you
knew
i
cared
for
you
but
you
did
think
i
might
be
in
love
with
you
but
you
thought
that
i
might
marry
you
without
being
in
love
with
you
because
you
did
believe
i
had
tried
to
marry
your
brother
and
i
only
knew
for
the
first
time
that
you
that
you
were
desperately
poor
she
said
ca
even
say
that
bibbs
it
was
true
i
did
try
to
make
jim
want
to
marry
me
i
did
and
she
sank
down
into
the
chair
weeping
bitterly
again
bibbs
was
agonized
he
groaned
did
know
you
could
cry
she
said
till
i
get
through
i
want
you
to
understand
we
were
poor
and
we
were
fitted
to
be
we
never
had
been
and
we
did
know
what
to
do
we
been
almost
rich
there
was
plenty
but
my
father
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
the
growth
of
the
town
he
wanted
to
be
richer
but
instead
well
just
about
the
time
your
father
finished
building
next
door
we
found
we
had
anything
people
say
that
sometimes
meaning
that
they
have
anything
in
comparison
with
other
people
of
their
own
kind
but
we
really
anything
we
had
anything
at
all
bibbs
and
we
could
do
anything
you
might
wonder
why
i
did
to
be
a
stenographer
and
i
wonder
myself
why
when
a
family
loses
its
money
people
always
say
the
daughters
to
go
and
be
stenographers
it
curious
as
if
a
wave
of
the
hand
made
you
into
a
stenographer
no
i
been
raised
to
be
either
married
comfortably
or
a
old
maid
if
i
chose
not
to
marry
the
poverty
came
on
slowly
bibbs
but
at
last
it
was
all
there
and
i
did
know
how
to
be
a
stenographer
i
did
know
how
to
be
anything
except
a
old
maid
or
somebody
wife
and
i
could
be
a
old
maid
then
bibbs
i
did
what
i
been
raised
to
know
how
to
do
i
went
out
to
be
fascinating
and
be
married
i
did
it
openly
at
least
and
with
a
kind
of
decent
honesty
i
told
your
brother
i
had
meant
to
fascinate
him
and
that
i
was
not
in
love
with
him
but
i
let
him
think
that
perhaps
i
meant
to
marry
him
i
think
i
did
mean
to
marry
him
i
had
never
cared
for
anybody
and
i
thought
it
might
be
there
really
was
anything
more
than
a
kind
of
excited
fondness
i
ca
be
sure
but
i
think
that
though
i
did
mean
to
marry
him
i
never
should
have
done
it
because
that
sort
of
a
marriage
is
it
sacrilege
something
would
have
stopped
me
something
did
stop
me
it
was
your
sibyl
she
meant
no
harm
but
she
was
horrible
and
she
put
what
i
was
doing
into
such
horrible
words
and
they
were
the
truth
oh
i
saw
myself
she
was
proposing
a
miserable
compact
with
me
and
i
could
breathe
the
air
of
the
same
room
with
her
though
i
so
cheapened
myself
she
had
a
right
to
assume
that
i
would
but
i
could
i
left
her
and
i
wrote
to
your
brother
just
a
quick
scrawl
i
told
him
just
what
i
done
i
asked
his
pardon
and
i
said
i
would
not
marry
him
i
posted
the
letter
but
he
never
got
it
that
was
the
afternoon
he
was
killed
that
all
bibbs
now
you
know
what
i
did
and
you
know
me
she
pressed
her
clenched
hands
tightly
against
her
eyes
leaning
far
forward
her
head
bowed
before
him
bibbs
had
forgotten
himself
long
ago
his
heart
broke
for
her
you
is
there
wo
you
he
stammered
i
going
with
father
is
there
some
way
you
could
use
the
money
without
without
she
gave
a
choked
little
laugh
gave
me
something
to
live
for
he
said
kept
me
alive
i
think
and
i
hurt
you
like
this
you
oh
no
could
forgive
me
mary
a
thousand
times
her
right
hand
went
out
in
a
faltering
gesture
and
just
touched
his
own
for
an
instant
there
nothing
to
you
ca
you
ca
what
bibbs
could
you
she
said
for
him
no
no
she
sprang
up
facing
him
and
without
knowing
what
she
did
she
set
her
hands
upon
his
breast
pushing
him
back
from
her
a
little
ca
i
ca
do
you
see
no
and
you
must
go
now
bibbs
i
ca
bear
any
more
please
never
never
she
cried
in
a
passion
of
tears
come
any
more
i
ca
see
you
dear
never
never
never
somehow
in
helpless
stumbling
obedience
to
her
beseeching
gesture
he
got
himself
to
the
door
and
out
of
the
house
chapter
xxx
sibyl
and
roscoe
were
upon
the
point
of
leaving
when
bibbs
returned
to
the
new
house
he
went
straight
to
sibyl
and
spoke
to
her
quietly
but
so
that
the
others
might
hear
you
said
that
if
i
stop
to
think
i
realize
that
no
one
would
be
apt
to
care
enough
about
me
to
marry
me
you
were
right
he
said
thought
perhaps
you
were
and
so
i
asked
miss
vertrees
to
marry
me
it
proved
what
you
said
of
me
and
disproved
what
you
said
of
her
she
and
having
thus
spoken
he
quitted
the
room
as
straightforwardly
as
he
had
entered
it
so
queer
sheridan
gasped
on
earth
would
thought
of
his
doin
that
told
you
said
her
husband
grimly
did
tell
us
he
go
over
there
and
told
you
she
would
have
him
i
told
you
she
would
have
jim
did
i
sibyl
was
altogether
taken
aback
you
supose
it
true
do
you
suppose
she
would
did
look
exactly
like
a
young
man
that
had
just
got
things
fixed
up
fine
with
his
girl
said
sheridan
to
me
he
did
why
would
told
you
he
interrupted
angrily
ai
that
kind
of
a
girl
if
you
got
to
have
proof
well
i
tell
you
and
get
it
over
with
though
i
pretty
near
just
as
soon
not
have
to
talk
a
whole
lot
about
my
dead
boy
private
affairs
she
wrote
to
jim
she
could
take
him
and
it
was
a
good
straight
letter
too
it
came
to
jim
office
he
never
saw
it
she
wrote
it
the
afternoon
he
was
remember
i
saw
her
put
a
letter
in
the
that
afternoon
said
roscoe
you
remember
sibyl
i
told
you
about
it
i
was
waiting
for
you
while
you
were
in
there
so
long
talking
to
her
mother
it
was
just
before
we
saw
that
something
was
wrong
over
here
and
edith
came
and
called
sibyl
shook
her
head
but
she
remembered
and
she
was
not
cast
down
for
although
some
remnants
of
perplexity
were
left
in
her
eyes
they
were
dimmed
by
an
increasing
glow
of
triumph
and
she
departed
after
some
further
fragmentary
discourse
visibly
elated
after
all
the
guilty
had
not
been
exalted
and
she
perceived
vaguely
but
none
the
less
surely
that
her
injury
had
been
copiously
avenged
she
bestowed
a
contented
glance
upon
the
old
house
with
the
cupola
as
she
and
roscoe
crossed
the
street
when
they
had
gone
sheridan
indulged
in
reverie
but
after
a
while
she
said
uneasily
you
think
it
would
be
any
use
to
tell
bibbs
about
that
letter
do
know
he
answered
walking
moodily
to
the
window
been
thinkin
about
he
came
to
a
decision
reckon
i
and
he
went
up
to
bibbs
room
you
goin
back
on
what
you
said
he
inquired
brusquely
as
he
opened
the
door
goin
to
take
it
back
and
lay
down
on
me
again
said
bibbs
perhaps
i
did
have
any
call
to
accuse
you
of
that
i
know
as
you
ever
did
go
back
on
anything
you
said
exactly
though
the
lord
knows
you
laid
down
on
me
enough
you
certainly
have
sheridan
was
baffled
this
was
not
what
he
wished
to
say
but
his
words
were
unmanageable
he
found
himself
unable
to
control
them
and
his
querulous
abuse
went
on
in
spite
of
him
ca
say
i
expect
much
of
you
not
from
the
way
you
always
been
up
to
now
unless
you
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
i
do
see
any
encouragement
to
think
you
goin
to
do
that
if
you
go
down
there
and
show
a
spark
o
real
i
reckon
the
whole
office
fall
in
a
faint
but
if
you
ever
goin
to
show
any
you
better
begin
right
at
the
beginning
and
begin
to
show
it
i
better
if
it
in
you
sheridan
was
sheerly
nonplussed
he
had
always
been
able
to
say
whatever
he
wished
to
say
but
his
tongue
seemed
bewitched
he
had
come
to
tell
bibbs
about
mary
letter
and
to
his
own
angry
astonishment
he
found
it
impossible
to
do
anything
except
to
scold
like
a
better
come
down
there
with
your
mind
made
up
to
hustle
harder
than
the
hardest
that
under
you
or
you
not
get
on
very
good
with
me
i
tell
you
the
way
to
get
ahead
and
you
better
set
it
down
in
your
books
the
way
to
get
ahead
is
to
do
ten
times
the
work
of
the
hardest
worker
that
works
for
you
but
you
do
know
what
work
is
yet
all
you
ever
done
was
just
stand
around
and
feed
a
machine
a
child
could
handle
and
then
come
home
and
take
a
bath
and
go
callin
i
tell
you
you
up
against
a
mighty
different
proposition
now
and
if
you
worth
your
salt
and
you
never
showed
any
signs
of
it
yet
not
any
signs
that
stuck
out
enough
to
bang
somebody
on
the
head
and
make
sit
up
and
take
notice
well
i
want
to
say
right
here
and
now
and
you
better
listen
because
i
want
to
say
just
what
i
do
say
i
say
he
meandered
to
a
full
stop
his
mouth
hung
open
and
his
mind
was
a
hopeless
blank
bibbs
looked
up
patiently
an
old
old
look
father
all
said
sheridan
frowning
heavily
all
i
came
to
say
and
you
better
you
remember
it
he
shook
his
head
warningly
and
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
with
a
crash
however
no
sound
of
footsteps
indicated
his
departure
he
stopped
just
outside
the
door
and
stood
there
a
minute
or
more
then
abruptly
he
turned
the
knob
and
exhibited
to
his
son
a
forehead
liberally
covered
with
perspiration
here
he
said
crossly
girl
over
yonder
wrote
jim
a
letter
know
said
bibbs
told
i
thought
you
need
feel
so
much
upset
about
it
the
door
closed
on
his
voice
as
he
withdrew
but
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
was
nevertheless
audible
you
knew
she
would
have
jim
and
he
stamped
his
way
to
tell
his
wife
to
quit
her
and
not
bother
him
with
any
more
fool
errands
she
was
about
to
inquire
what
bibbs
but
after
a
second
thought
she
decided
not
to
speak
at
all
she
merely
murmured
a
wordless
assent
and
verbal
communication
was
given
over
between
them
for
the
rest
of
that
afternoon
bibbs
and
his
father
were
gone
when
sheridan
woke
the
next
morning
and
she
had
a
dreary
day
she
missed
edith
woefully
and
she
worried
about
what
might
be
taking
place
in
the
sheridan
building
she
felt
that
everything
depended
on
how
bibbs
hold
and
upon
her
husband
return
in
the
evening
she
seized
upon
the
first
opportunity
to
ask
him
how
things
had
gone
he
was
what
could
anybody
tell
by
the
first
day
he
seen
plenty
go
at
things
well
enough
right
at
the
start
and
then
blow
up
pretty
near
anybody
could
show
up
fair
the
first
day
or
so
there
was
a
big
job
ahead
this
material
such
as
it
was
bibbs
in
fact
had
to
be
broken
in
to
handling
the
work
roscoe
had
done
and
then
at
least
as
an
overseer
he
must
take
jim
position
in
the
realty
company
as
well
he
told
her
to
ask
him
again
in
a
month
but
during
the
course
of
dinner
she
gathered
from
some
disjointed
remarks
of
his
that
he
and
bibbs
had
lunched
together
at
the
small
restaurant
where
it
had
been
sheridan
custom
to
lunch
with
jim
and
she
took
this
to
be
an
encouraging
sign
bibbs
went
to
his
room
as
soon
as
they
left
the
table
and
her
husband
was
not
communicative
after
reading
his
paper
she
became
an
anxious
spectator
of
bibbs
progress
as
a
man
of
business
although
it
was
a
progress
she
could
glimpse
but
dimly
and
only
in
the
evening
through
his
remarks
and
his
father
at
dinner
usually
bibbs
was
silent
except
when
directly
addressed
but
on
the
first
evening
of
the
third
week
of
his
new
career
he
offered
an
opinion
which
had
apparently
been
the
subject
of
previous
argument
like
you
to
understand
just
what
i
meant
about
those
father
he
said
as
jackson
placed
his
coffee
before
him
agreed
with
me
but
you
would
listen
to
can
talk
if
you
want
to
and
i
listen
sheridan
returned
you
ca
show
me
that
jim
ever
took
up
with
a
bad
thing
the
roof
fell
because
it
had
had
time
to
settle
and
on
account
of
weather
conditions
i
want
that
building
put
just
the
way
jim
planned
ca
have
it
said
bibbs
ca
because
jim
planned
for
the
building
to
stand
up
and
it
wo
do
it
the
other
one
the
one
that
did
fall
is
so
shot
with
cracks
we
have
dared
use
it
for
storage
it
wo
stand
weight
there
only
one
thing
to
do
get
both
buildings
down
as
quickly
as
we
can
and
build
over
brick
the
best
and
cheapest
in
the
long
run
for
that
sheridan
looked
sarcastic
what
we
goin
to
do
for
while
we
waitin
for
those
few
bricks
to
be
laid
bibbs
returned
promptly
lose
money
if
we
do
rent
anyhow
they
were
waiting
so
long
for
you
to
give
the
warehouse
matter
your
attention
after
the
roof
fell
you
do
know
what
an
amount
of
stuff
they
got
piled
up
on
us
over
there
we
have
to
rent
until
we
could
patch
up
those
process
perils
and
the
krivitch
manufacturing
company
plant
is
empty
right
across
the
street
i
took
an
option
on
it
for
us
this
sheridan
expression
was
queer
here
he
said
sharply
you
go
and
do
that
without
consulting
me
did
cost
anything
said
bibbs
only
until
afternoon
at
two
i
undertook
to
convince
you
before
you
did
sheridan
tone
was
sardonic
just
suppose
you
could
convince
can
though
and
i
intend
to
said
bibbs
quietly
do
think
you
understand
the
condition
of
those
buildings
you
want
patched
see
here
said
sheridan
with
slow
emphasis
i
had
my
mind
set
about
this
jim
thought
they
stand
and
suppose
it
was
well
kind
of
a
matter
of
sentiment
with
me
to
prove
he
was
bibbs
looked
at
him
compassionately
sorry
if
you
have
a
sentiment
about
it
father
he
said
whether
you
have
or
not
ca
make
a
difference
you
get
other
people
hurt
if
you
trust
that
process
and
that
wo
do
and
if
you
want
a
monument
to
jim
at
least
you
want
one
that
will
stand
besides
i
do
think
you
can
reasonably
defend
sentiment
in
this
particular
kind
of
you
do
but
i
sorry
you
did
tell
me
you
felt
sheridan
was
puzzled
by
his
son
tone
are
you
he
asked
curiously
i
had
the
building
inspector
up
there
this
noon
said
bibbs
i
had
him
condemn
both
those
been
afraid
to
do
it
before
until
he
heard
from
us
afraid
see
he
lost
his
job
but
he
ca
them
they
got
to
come
down
sheridan
gave
him
a
long
and
piercing
stare
from
beneath
lowered
brows
finally
he
said
long
did
they
give
you
on
that
option
to
convince
me
two
right
said
sheridan
not
relaxing
bibbs
jumped
up
thought
you
would
be
i
telephone
the
krivitch
agent
he
gave
me
the
option
until
but
i
told
him
i
settle
it
this
sheridan
gazed
after
him
as
he
left
the
room
and
then
though
his
expression
did
not
alter
in
the
slightest
a
sound
came
from
him
that
startled
his
wife
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
she
had
heard
anything
resembling
a
chuckle
from
him
and
this
sound
although
it
was
grim
and
dry
bore
that
resemblance
she
brightened
eagerly
like
he
was
startin
right
well
do
it
papa
lord
he
got
me
on
the
hip
why
he
knew
what
i
wanted
that
why
he
had
the
inspector
up
there
he
have
me
beat
before
we
even
started
to
talk
about
it
and
did
you
hear
him
reasonably
defend
sentiment
and
the
way
he
says
an
option
for
us
piled
up
on
us
there
was
always
an
alloy
for
sheridan
do
just
like
the
way
he
looks
though
there
got
to
be
something
only
one
chick
left
at
home
so
you
start
to
frettin
about
it
he
changed
there
kind
of
a
settish
look
to
his
face
and
guess
that
the
common
sense
comin
out
on
him
then
said
sheridan
see
symptoms
like
that
in
a
good
many
business
men
i
and
he
do
have
as
good
color
as
he
was
gettin
before
and
he
begun
to
fill
out
some
but
sheridan
gave
forth
another
dry
chuckle
and
going
round
the
table
to
her
patted
her
upon
the
shoulder
with
his
left
hand
his
right
being
still
heavily
bandaged
though
he
no
longer
wore
a
sling
the
way
it
is
with
you
mamma
got
to
take
your
frettin
out
one
way
if
you
do
another
he
do
look
well
it
ai
exactly
the
way
he
looked
when
he
begun
to
get
sick
that
time
but
he
kind
o
seems
to
be
losin
some
he
may
lost
something
said
sheridan
expect
he
lost
a
whole
lot
o
foolishness
besides
his
notions
about
poetry
and
his
wife
persisted
mean
he
looks
right
peakid
and
yesterday
when
he
was
settin
with
us
he
kept
lookin
out
the
window
he
why
should
he
look
out
the
window
was
lookin
over
there
he
never
read
a
word
all
afternoon
i
here
said
sheridan
might
kept
goin
on
over
there
the
rest
of
his
life
moonin
on
and
on
but
what
he
heard
sibyl
say
did
one
big
thing
anyway
it
woke
him
up
out
of
his
trance
well
he
had
to
go
and
bust
clean
out
with
a
bang
and
that
stopped
his
goin
over
there
and
it
stopped
his
poetry
but
i
reckon
he
begun
to
get
pretty
fair
pay
for
what
he
lost
i
guess
a
good
many
young
men
have
had
to
get
over
worries
like
his
they
got
to
lose
something
if
they
to
keep
ahead
o
the
procession
nowadays
and
it
kind
o
looks
to
me
mamma
like
bibbs
might
keep
quite
a
considerable
long
way
ahead
why
a
year
from
now
i
bet
you
he
wo
know
there
ever
was
such
a
thing
as
poetry
and
ai
he
funny
he
wanted
to
stick
to
the
shop
so
he
could
what
he
meant
was
think
about
something
useless
well
i
guess
he
keepin
his
mind
pretty
occupied
the
other
way
these
days
yes
sir
it
took
a
pretty
shock
to
get
him
out
of
his
trance
but
it
certainly
did
the
he
patted
his
wife
shoulder
again
and
then
without
any
prefatory
symptoms
broke
into
a
boisterous
laugh
mamma
he
works
like
a
gorilla
chapter
xxi
and
so
bibbs
sat
in
the
porch
of
the
temple
with
the
but
no
one
came
to
scourge
him
forth
for
this
was
the
temple
of
bigness
and
the
changing
of
money
was
holy
worship
and
true
religion
the
priests
wore
that
look
bibbs
mother
had
seen
beginning
to
develop
about
his
mouth
and
eyes
a
wary
look
which
she
could
not
define
but
it
comes
with
service
at
the
temple
and
it
was
the
more
marked
upon
bibbs
for
his
sharp
awakening
to
the
necessities
of
that
service
he
did
as
little
thinking
as
possible
giving
himself
no
time
for
it
he
worked
continuously
keeping
his
thoughts
still
on
his
work
when
he
came
home
at
night
and
he
talked
of
nothing
whatever
except
his
work
but
he
did
not
sing
at
it
he
was
often
in
the
streets
and
people
were
not
allowed
to
sing
in
the
streets
they
might
make
any
manner
of
hideous
uproar
they
could
shake
buildings
they
could
the
thunder
deafen
the
deaf
and
kill
the
sick
with
noise
or
they
could
walk
the
streets
or
drive
through
them
bawling
squawking
or
screeching
as
they
chose
if
the
noise
was
traceably
connected
with
business
though
street
musicians
were
not
tolerated
being
considered
a
nuisance
and
an
interference
a
man
or
woman
who
went
singing
for
pleasure
through
the
streets
like
a
crazy
neopolitan
would
have
been
stopped
and
belike
locked
up
for
freedom
does
not
mean
that
a
citizen
is
allowed
to
do
every
outrageous
thing
that
comes
into
his
head
the
streets
were
dangerous
enough
in
all
conscience
without
any
singing
and
the
motor
federation
issued
public
warnings
declaring
that
the
pedestrian
life
was
in
his
own
hands
and
giving
directions
how
to
proceed
with
the
least
peril
however
bibbs
sheridan
had
no
desire
to
sing
in
the
streets
or
anywhere
he
had
gone
to
his
work
with
an
energy
that
for
the
start
at
least
was
bitter
and
there
was
no
song
left
in
him
he
began
to
know
his
active
here
and
there
among
them
he
found
a
leisurely
kind
soul
a
relic
of
the
old
period
of
neighborliness
stock
usually
and
there
were
men
particularly
among
the
merchants
and
manufacturers
honest
they
leaned
reputations
sometimes
attested
by
stories
of
heroic
sacrifices
to
honor
nor
were
there
lacking
some
instances
of
generosity
even
nobler
here
and
there
too
were
in
their
little
leisure
and
among
the
germans
and
these
with
the
others
worshiped
bigness
and
the
growth
each
man
serving
for
his
own
sake
and
for
what
he
could
get
out
of
it
but
all
united
in
their
faith
in
the
beneficence
and
glory
of
their
god
to
almost
all
alike
that
service
stood
as
the
most
important
thing
in
life
except
on
occasion
of
some
such
vital
brief
interregnum
as
the
dangerous
illness
of
a
wife
or
child
in
the
way
of
some
of
the
servers
took
golf
some
took
fishing
some
took
a
mixture
of
infantile
and
negroid
humor
stockings
and
tin
music
some
took
an
occasional
debauch
some
took
trips
some
took
cards
and
some
took
nothing
the
high
priests
were
vigilant
to
watch
that
no
should
affect
the
service
when
a
man
attended
to
anything
outside
his
business
eyes
were
upon
him
his
credit
was
in
danger
that
is
his
life
was
in
danger
and
the
old
priests
were
as
ardent
as
the
young
ones
the
million
was
as
eager
to
be
bigger
as
the
thousand
seventy
was
as
busy
as
seventeen
they
strove
mightily
against
one
another
and
the
old
priests
were
the
most
wary
the
most
plausible
and
the
most
dangerous
bibbs
learned
he
must
walk
charily
among
these
he
must
wear
a
thousand
eyes
and
beware
of
spiders
indeed
and
outside
the
temple
itself
were
the
pretenders
the
swarming
thieves
and
sharpers
and
fleecers
the
sly
rascals
and
the
open
rascals
but
these
were
feeble
folk
not
dangerous
once
he
knew
them
and
he
had
a
good
guide
to
point
them
out
to
him
they
were
useful
sometimes
he
learned
and
many
of
them
served
as
in
matters
where
business
must
touch
politics
he
learned
also
how
breweries
and
companies
and
banks
and
other
institutions
fought
one
another
for
the
political
control
of
the
city
the
newspapers
he
discovered
had
lost
their
ancient
political
influence
especially
with
the
knowing
who
looked
upon
them
with
a
skeptical
humor
believing
the
journals
either
to
be
retained
partisans
like
lawyers
or
else
striving
to
forward
the
personal
ambitions
of
their
owners
the
control
of
the
city
lay
not
with
them
but
was
usually
obtained
by
giving
the
hordes
of
negroes
and
by
other
largesses
the
revenues
of
the
people
were
then
distributed
as
fairly
as
possible
among
a
great
number
of
men
who
had
assisted
the
winning
side
names
and
titles
of
offices
went
with
many
of
the
prizes
and
most
of
these
were
expected
to
present
a
busy
appearance
at
times
and
indeed
some
among
them
did
work
honestly
and
faithfully
bibbs
had
been
very
ignorant
all
these
simple
things
so
well
known
and
customary
astonished
him
at
first
and
once
in
a
brief
moment
of
forgetting
that
he
was
done
with
writing
he
thought
that
if
he
had
known
them
and
written
of
them
how
like
a
satire
the
plainest
relation
of
them
must
have
seemed
strangest
of
all
to
him
was
the
vehement
and
sincere
patriotism
on
every
side
he
heard
it
it
was
a
permeation
the
newest
caught
it
though
just
from
hungary
and
learning
to
stammer
a
few
words
of
the
local
language
everywhere
the
people
shouted
of
the
power
the
size
the
riches
and
the
growth
of
their
city
not
only
that
they
said
that
the
people
of
their
city
were
the
greatest
the
the
strongest
the
biggest
people
on
earth
they
cited
no
authorities
and
felt
the
need
of
none
being
themselves
the
people
thus
celebrated
and
if
the
thing
was
questioned
or
if
it
was
hinted
that
there
might
be
one
small
virtue
in
which
they
were
not
perfect
and
supreme
they
wasted
no
time
examining
themselves
to
see
if
what
the
critic
said
was
true
but
fell
upon
him
and
hooted
him
and
cursed
him
for
they
were
sensitive
so
bibbs
learning
their
ways
and
walking
with
them
harkened
to
the
voice
of
the
people
and
served
bigness
with
them
for
the
voice
of
the
people
is
the
voice
of
their
god
sheridan
had
made
the
room
next
to
his
own
into
an
office
for
bibbs
and
the
door
between
the
two
rooms
usually
stood
open
the
father
had
established
that
intimacy
one
morning
in
february
when
bibbs
was
alone
sheridan
came
in
some
sheets
of
typewritten
memoranda
in
his
hand
he
said
do
like
to
butt
in
very
often
this
way
and
when
i
do
i
usually
wish
i
had
but
for
heaven
sake
what
have
you
been
buying
that
ole
busted
stock
for
bibbs
leaned
back
from
his
desk
eleven
hundred
and
dollars
that
all
it
it
ai
worth
eleven
hundred
and
cents
you
ought
to
know
that
i
do
get
your
idea
that
stuff
adam
cat
might
be
worth
something
some
might
be
so
dead
not
if
we
went
into
it
said
bibbs
coolly
sheridan
considered
this
musingly
then
he
said
you
buy
it
from
broker
he
must
got
it
from
one
o
the
crowd
o
poor
ninnies
that
was
soaked
with
it
do
you
know
who
owned
it
i
sayin
though
that
it
what
the
matter
belonged
to
vertrees
said
bibbs
shortly
applying
himself
to
his
desk
sheridan
gazed
down
at
his
son
thin
face
me
he
said
and
he
went
back
to
his
own
room
but
presently
he
looked
in
again
reckon
you
wo
mind
lunchin
alone
he
was
shuffling
himself
into
his
overcoat
i
just
thought
i
go
up
to
the
house
and
get
this
over
with
he
glanced
apologetically
toward
his
right
hand
as
it
emerged
from
the
sleeve
of
the
overcoat
the
bandages
had
been
removed
finally
that
morning
revealing
but
three
fingers
the
forefinger
and
the
finger
next
to
it
had
been
amputated
bound
to
make
an
awful
fuss
and
better
to
spoil
her
lunch
than
her
dinner
i
be
back
about
but
he
calculated
the
time
of
his
arrival
at
the
new
house
so
accurately
that
sheridan
lunch
was
not
disturbed
and
she
was
rising
from
the
lonely
table
when
he
came
into
the
he
had
left
his
overcoat
in
the
hall
but
he
kept
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
the
matter
papa
she
asked
quickly
anything
gone
wrong

ai
sick
he
laughed
loudly
sick
had
lunch
want
any
you
can
give
me
a
cup
o
coffee
she
rang
and
told
george
to
have
coffee
made
and
when
he
had
withdrawn
she
said
querulously
just
know
there
something
in
the
world
he
responded
heartily
taking
a
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
thought
i
talk
over
a
notion
o
mine
with
you
that
all
it
more
business
than
what

man

up
at
the
office

morning
awhile
look
at
your
hand
how
he
say

doin
well
he
went
in
and
sat
around
with
bibbs
awhile
sheridan
nodded
pessimistically
guess
it
time
you
had
him
too
i
knew
bibbs
mamma
hold
your
horses
i
wanted
him
to
look
bibbs

afterwards
i
shut

door
and
i
an
ole
gurney
had
a
talk

a
mighty
disagreeable
man
he
rubbed
it
in
on
me
what
he
said
about
bibbs
havin
brains
if
he
ever
woke
up
then
i
thought
he
must
want
to
get
something
out
o
me
he
got
so
flattering
for
a
minute
could
help
havin
business
brains
he
says

surprised
at
his
makin
a
success

says

over
his
heredity

business

once
you

into
it

in
his
blood
yes

that
he
says
it
does
need
a
special
kind
o
brains

a
millionaire
i
mean

and
the
right
kind
o

only
miracle

the
other
kind
o
brains
the
brains
you
made
him
quit
usin
and
throw
away
what
he
say
about
his
health
sheridan
demanded
impatiently
as
george
placed
a
cup
of
coffee
before
her
husband
sheridan
helped
himself
to
cream
and
sugar
and
began
to
sip
the
coffee
comin
to
that
he
returned
placidly
how
easy
i
manage
this
cup
with
my
left
hand
mamma
been
doin
that
all
winter
what
did
wonderful
he
interrupted
admiringly
a
fellow
can
do
with
his
left
hand
i
can
sign
my
name
with
mine
now
well
i
ever
could
with
my
right
it
came
a
little
hard
at
first
but
now
honest
i
believe
i
rather
sign
with
my
left
that
all
i
ever
have
to
write
anyway
just
the
signature
rest
all
he
blew
across
the
top
of
the
cup
unctuously
coffee
mamma
well
about
bibbs
ole
gurney
says
he
believes
if
bibbs
could
somehow
get
back
to
the
state
mind
he
was
in
about
the
that
is
if
he
could
some
way
get
to
feelin
about
business
the
way
he
felt
about
the
shop
not
the
poetry
and
writin
part
but
he
paused
supplementing
his
remarks
with
a
motion
of
his
head
toward
the
old
house
next
door
says
bibbs
is
older
and
what
he
was
when
he
broke
down
that
time
and
besides
he
ai
the
kind
o
dreamy
way
he
was
then
and
i
should
say
he
ai
i
like
to
show
me
anybody
his
age
that
any
wider
awake
but
he
says
bibbs
health
never
need
bother
us
again
if
sheridan
shook
her
head
do
see
any
help
that
way
you
know
yourself
she
would
have
talkin
about
her
havin
anybody
but
my
lord
she
might
let
him
look
at
her
she
need
got
so
mad
just
because
he
asked
her
that
she
wo
let
him
come
in
the
house
any
more
he
a
mighty
funny
boy
and
some
ways
i
reckon
he
pretty
near
as
hard
to
understand
as
the
bible
but
gurney
kind
o
got
me
in
the
way
o
thinkin
that
if
she
let
him
come
back
and
set
around
with
her
an
evening
or
two
sometimes
not
i
do
mean
why
well
i
just
thought
i
see
what
you
think
of
it
there
ai
any
way
to
talk
about
it
to
bibbs
himself
i
do
suppose
he
let
you
anyhow
but
i
thought
maybe
you
could
kind
o
slip
over
there
some
day
and
sort
o
fix
up
to
have
a
little
talk
with
her
and
kind
o
hint
around
till
you
see
how
the
land
lays
and
ask
her
sheridan
looked
both
helpless
and
frightened
she
shook
her
head
decidedly
would
do
any
wo
try
it
wo
risk
her
turnin
me
out
o
the
house
some
way
that
what
i
believe
she
did
to
sibyl
from
what
roscoe
said
once
no
i
ca
and
what
more
it
only
make
things
worse
if
people
find
out
runnin
after
they
think
you
cheap
and
then
they
wo
do
as
much
for
you
as
if
you
let
alone
i
do
believe
it
any
use
and
i
could
do
it
if
it
he
sighed
with
resignation
right
mamma
that
then
in
a
livelier
tone
he
said
gurney
took
the
bandages
off
my
hand
this
morning
all
healed
up
says
i
do
need
any
that
splendid
papa
she
cried
beaming
was
afraid
she
came
toward
him
but
he
rose
still
keeping
his
hand
in
his
pocket
a
minute
he
said
smiling
it
may
give
you
just
a
teeny
bit
of
a
shock
but
the
fact
is
well
you
remember
that
sunday
when
sibyl
came
over
here
and
made
all
that
fuss
about
nothin
it
was
the
day
after
i
got
tired
o
that
statue
when
edith
telegram
came
me
see
your
hand
she
cried
wait
he
said
laughing
and
pushing
her
away
with
his
left
hand
truth
is
mamma
that
i
kind
o
slipped
out
on
you
that
morning
when
you
was
lookin
and
went
down
to
ole
gurney
office
he
told
me
to
you
see
and
well
it
does
amount
to
and
he
held
out
for
her
inspection
the
mutilated
hand
see
these
days
when
it
all
dictatin
anyhow
nobody
mind
just
a
couple
o
he
had
to
jump
for
her
she
went
over
backward
for
the
second
time
in
her
life
sheridan
fainted
chapter
xxxii
it
was
a
full
hour
later
when
he
left
her
lying
upon
a
couch
in
her
own
room
still
lamenting
intermittently
though
he
assured
her
with
heat
that
the
she
was
making
irked
him
far
more
than
his
physical
loss
he
permitted
her
to
think
that
he
meant
to
return
directly
to
his
office
but
when
he
came
out
to
the
open
air
he
told
the
chauffeur
in
attendance
to
await
him
in
front
of
vertrees
house
whither
he
himself
proceeded
on
foot
vertrees
had
taken
the
sale
of
half
of
his
worthless
stock
as
manna
in
the
wilderness
it
came
from
heaven
by
what
agency
he
did
not
particularly
question
the
broker
informed
him
that
were
interested
in
getting
hold
of
the
stock
and
that
later
there
might
be
a
possible
increase
in
the
value
of
the
large
amount
retained
by
his
client
it
might
go
a
ways
within
a
year
or
so
he
said
and
he
advised
with
it
vertrees
went
home
and
prayed
he
rose
from
his
knees
feeling
that
he
was
surely
coming
into
his
own
again
it
was
more
than
a
mere
gasp
of
temporary
relief
with
him
and
his
wife
shared
his
optimism
but
mary
would
not
let
him
buy
back
her
piano
and
as
for
furs
spring
was
on
the
way
she
said
but
they
paid
the
butcher
the
baker
and
the
and
hired
a
cook
once
more
it
was
this
servitress
who
opened
the
door
for
sheridan
and
presently
assured
him
that
miss
vertrees
would
he
was
not
the
man
to
conceal
admiration
when
he
felt
it
and
he
flushed
and
beamed
as
mary
made
her
appearance
almost
upon
the
heels
of
the
cook
she
had
a
look
of
apprehension
for
the
first
fraction
of
a
second
but
it
vanished
at
the
sight
of
him
and
its
place
was
taken
in
her
eyes
by
a
soft
brilliance
while
color
rushed
in
her
cheeks
be
surprised
he
said
is
in
a
way
it
sort
of
on
business
i
looked
in
here
it
only
take
a
minute
i
sorry
said
mary
hoped
you
come
because
we
he
chuckled
sometimes
people
do
see
so
much
o
their
neighbors
as
they
used
to
that
is
i
hear
so
stay
long
enough
to
sit
down
wo
you
guess
i
could
manage
that
and
they
sat
down
facing
each
other
and
not
far
apart
course
it
could
be
called
business
exactly
he
said
more
gravely
at
all
i
expect
but
there
something
o
yours
it
seemed
to
me
i
ought
to
give
you
and
i
just
thought
it
was
better
to
bring
it
myself
and
explain
how
i
happened
to
have
it
it
this
this
letter
you
wrote
my
he
extended
the
letter
to
her
solemnly
in
his
left
hand
and
she
took
it
gently
from
him
was
in
his
mail
after
he
was
hurt
you
knew
he
never
got
it
i
she
said
in
a
low
voice
he
sighed
glad
he
did
not
he
added
quickly
but
what
you
did
just
right
to
send
it
you
did
you
could
acted
any
other
way
when
it
came
right
down
to
it
there
ai
any
blame
comin
to
you
you
were
all
mary
said
you
almost
in
a
whisper
and
with
her
head
bowed
low
have
to
excuse
me
for
readin
it
i
had
to
take
charge
of
all
his
mail
and
everything
i
did
know
the
handwritin
and
i
read
it
all
once
i
got
glad
you
he
leaned
forward
as
if
to
rise
guess
that
about
all
i
just
thought
you
ought
to
have
you
for
bringing
he
looked
at
her
hopefully
as
if
he
thought
and
wished
that
she
might
have
something
more
to
say
but
she
seemed
not
to
be
aware
of
this
glance
and
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
sorrowfully
upon
the
floor
i
expect
i
better
be
gettin
back
to
the
office
he
said
rising
desperately
told
i
told
my
partner
i
be
back
at
two
and
i
guess
he
think
i
a
poor
business
man
if
he
catches
me
behind
time
i
got
to
walk
the
chalk
a
mighty
straight
line
these
days
with
that
fellow
keepin
tabs
on
me
mary
rose
with
him
always
heard
you
were
the
hard
he
guffawed
derisively
i
nothin
to
that
partner
o
mine
you
could
guess
to
save
your
life
how
he
keeps
after
me
to
hold
up
my
end
o
the
job
i
should
be
surprised
he
give
me
the
grand
bounce
some
day
and
run
the
whole
circus
by
himself
you
know
how
he
is
once
he
goes
at
a
thing
she
smiled
did
know
you
had
a
partner
i
always
heard
he
laughed
looking
away
from
her
just
my
way
o
speakin
o
that
boy
o
mine
he
stood
then
expectant
staring
out
into
the
hall
with
an
air
of
careless
geniality
he
felt
that
she
certainly
must
at
least
say
is
bibbs
but
she
said
nothing
at
all
though
he
waited
until
the
silence
became
embarrassing
i
guess
i
better
be
gettin
down
there
he
said
at
last
might
and
thank
you
said
mary
what
the
he
said
blankly
welcome
mary
put
out
her
hand
have
to
excuse
my
left
hand
he
said
had
a
little
accident
to
the
other
she
gave
a
pitying
cry
as
she
saw
poor
sheridan
at
all
dictate
everything
nowadays
he
laughed
jovially
anybody
tell
you
how
it
happened
heard
you
hurt
your
hand
but
no
not
just
was
this
way
he
began
and
both
as
if
unconsciously
sat
down
again
may
not
know
it
but
i
used
to
worry
a
good
deal
about
the
youngest
o
my
boys
the
one
that
used
to
come
to
see
you
sometimes
after
jim
that
is
i
mean
bibbs
he
the
one
i
spoke
of
as
my
partner
and
the
truth
is
that
what
it
just
about
goin
to
amount
to
one
these
days
if
his
health
holds
out
well
you
remember
i
expect
i
had
him
on
a
machine
over
at
a
plant
o
mine
and
sometimes
i
kind
sneak
in
there
and
see
how
he
was
gettin
along
take
a
doctor
with
me
sometimes
because
bibbs
never
was
so
robust
you
might
say
ole
doc
gurney
i
guess
maybe
you
know
him
tall
thin
man
acts
sleepy
one
day
i
an
ole
doc
gurney
we
were
in
there
and
i
undertook
to
show
bibbs
how
to
run
his
machine
he
told
me
to
look
out
but
i
would
listen
and
i
did
look
out
and
that
how
i
got
my
hand
hurt
tryin
to
show
bibbs
how
to
do
something
he
knew
how
to
do
and
i
did
made
me
so
mad
i
just
would
even
admit
to
myself
it
was
hurt
and
so
by
and
by
ole
doc
gurney
had
to
take
kind
o
radical
measures
with
me
he
a
right
good
doctor
too
do
you
think
so
miss
vertrees
he
is
so
sheridan
now
had
the
air
of
a
rambling
talker
and
gossip
with
all
day
on
his
hands
him
on
bibbs
case
i
was
talkin
about
bibbs
case
with
him
this
morning
well
you
laugh
to
hear
the
way
ole
gurney
talks
about
that
he
is
just
as
much
a
friend
as
he
is
doctor
and
he
takes
as
much
interest
in
bibbs
as
if
he
was
in
the
family
he
says
bibbs
is
anyways
bad
off
yet
and
he
thinks
he
could
stand
the
pace
and
get
fat
on
it
if
well
this
is
what
made
you
laugh
if
you
been
there
miss
vertrees
honest
it
would
he
paused
to
chuckle
and
stole
a
glance
at
her
she
was
gazing
straight
before
her
at
the
wall
her
lips
were
parted
and
visibly
she
was
breathing
heavily
and
quickly
he
feared
that
she
was
growing
furiously
angry
but
he
had
led
to
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
he
went
on
determined
now
to
say
it
all
he
leaned
forward
and
altered
his
voice
to
one
of
confidential
friendliness
though
in
it
he
still
maintained
a
tone
which
indicated
that
ole
doc
gurney
opinion
was
only
a
joke
he
shared
with
her
sir
you
certainly
would
laughed
why
that
ole
man
thinks
you
got
something
to
do
with
it
you
have
to
blame
it
on
him
young
lady
if
it
makes
you
feel
like
startin
out
to
whip
somebody
he
actually
got
this
theory
he
says
bibbs
got
to
gettin
better
while
he
worked
over
there
at
the
shop
because
you
kept
him
cheered
up
and
feelin
good
and
he
says
if
you
could
manage
to
just
stand
him
hangin
around
a
little
maybe
not
much
but
just
sometimes
again
he
believed
it
do
bibbs
a
mighty
lot
o
good
that
only
what
the
doctor
said
me
i
do
know
anything
about
that
but
i
can
say
this
much
i
never
saw
any
such
a
mental
improvement
in
anybody
in
my
life
as
i
have
lately
in
bibbs
i
expect
you
find
him
a
good
deal
more
entertaining
than
what
he
used
to
be
and
i
know
it
a
kind
of
embarrassing
thing
to
suggest
after
the
way
he
piled
in
over
here
that
day
to
ask
you
to
stand
up
before
the
preacher
with
him
but
accordin
to
ole
doc
gurney
he
got
you
on
his
brain
so
bad
mary
jumped
sheridan
she
exclaimed
he
sighed
profoundly
i
noticed
you
were
gettin
mad
i
did
no
no
she
cried
i
do
understand
and
i
think
you
do
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
he
sighed
again
but
this
time
with
relief
well
he
said
right
it
be
easier
to
talk
plain
i
ought
to
known
i
could
with
you
all
the
time
i
just
hoped
you
let
that
boy
come
and
see
you
sometimes
once
more
could
you
do
she
clasped
her
hands
together
in
a
sorrowful
gesture
we
must
talk
plain
bibbs
heard
that
i
tried
to
make
your
oldest
son
care
for
me
because
i
was
poor
and
so
bibbs
came
and
asked
me
to
marry
him
because
he
was
sorry
for
me
and
i
ca
see
him
any
more
she
cried
in
distress
ca
sheridan
cleared
his
throat
uncomfortably
mean
because
he
thought
that
about
you
no
what
he
thought
was
true
you
mean
he
was
so
much
in
you
mean
he
thought
so
much
of
you
the
words
were
inconceivably
awkward
upon
sheridan
tongue
he
seemed
to
be
in
doubt
even
about
pronouncing
them
but
after
a
ghastly
pause
he
bravely
repeated
them
mean
he
thought
so
much
of
you
that
you
just
could
stand
him
around
he
was
sorry
for
me
he
cared
for
me
he
was
fond
of
me
and
respected
me
too
much
in
the
finest
way
he
loved
me
if
you
like
and
he
have
done
anything
on
earth
for
me
as
i
would
for
him
and
as
he
knew
i
would
it
was
beautiful
sheridan
she
said
the
cheap
bad
things
one
has
done
seem
always
to
come
back
they
wait
and
pull
you
down
when
you
happiest
bibbs
found
me
out
you
see
and
he
was
love
with
me
at
was
well
it
seems
to
me
he
gave
up
everything
he
wanted
to
do
it
was
fool
stuff
but
he
certainly
wanted
it
mighty
bad
he
just
threw
it
away
and
walked
right
up
and
took
the
job
he
swore
he
never
would
just
for
you
and
it
looks
to
me
as
if
a
man
that
do
that
must
think
quite
a
heap
o
the
girl
he
does
it
for
you
say
it
was
only
because
he
was
sorry
but
let
me
tell
you
there
only
one
girl
he
could
feel
that
sorry
for
yes
sir
no
she
said
is
like
other
men
he
would
do
anything
for
sheridan
grinned
not
so
much
as
you
think
nowadays
he
said
instance
i
got
kind
of
a
suspicion
he
does
believe
in
in
business
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
what
he
wanted
was
just
plain
and
simple
for
you
to
marry
him
well
i
was
afraid
his
thinkin
so
much
of
you
had
kind
o
sickened
you
of
him
the
way
it
does
sometimes
but
from
the
way
you
talk
i
understand
that
ai
the
he
coughed
and
his
voice
trembled
a
little
here
miss
vertrees
i
do
have
to
tell
you
because
you
see
things
easy
i
know
i
got
no
business
comin
to
you
like
this
but
i
had
to
make
bibbs
go
my
way
instead
of
his
own
i
had
to
do
it
for
the
sake
my
business
and
on
his
own
account
too
and
i
expect
you
got
some
idea
how
it
hurt
him
to
give
up
well
he
made
good
he
did
come
in
or
mean
he
came
in
all
the
way
but
there
is
anything
in
it
to
him
you
can
see
he
just
shut
his
teeth
on
it
and
goin
ahead
with
dust
in
his
mouth
you
see
one
way
of
lookin
at
it
got
nothin
to
work
for
and
it
seems
to
me
like
it
cost
him
your
friendship
and
i
believe
honest
that
what
hurt
him
the
worst
now
you
said
we
talk
plain
why
ca
you
let
him
come
back
she
covered
her
face
desperately
with
her
hands
ca
he
rose
defeated
and
looking
it
i
must
press
you
he
said
gently
at
that
she
cried
out
and
dropped
her
hands
and
let
him
see
her
face
he
was
only
sorry
for
me
he
gazed
at
her
intently
mary
was
proud
but
she
had
a
fatal
honesty
and
it
confessed
the
truth
of
her
now
she
was
helpless
it
was
so
clear
that
even
sheridan
marveling
and
amazed
was
able
to
see
it
then
a
change
came
over
him
gloom
fell
from
him
and
he
grew
radiant
she
cried
must
wo
tell
him
said
sheridan
from
the
doorway
wo
tell
anybody
anything
chapter
xxxiii
there
was
a
heavy
that
afternoon
a
densest
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
temple
the
people
went
about
in
it
busy
and
dirty
thickening
their
outside
and
inside
linings
of
asphalt
sulphurous
acid
oil
of
vitriol
and
the
other
familiar
things
the
men
liked
to
breathe
and
to
have
upon
their
skins
and
garments
and
upon
their
wives
and
babies
and
sweethearts
the
growth
of
the
city
was
visible
in
the
smoke
and
the
noise
and
the
rush
there
was
more
smoke
than
there
had
been
this
day
of
february
a
year
earlier
there
was
more
noise
and
the
crowds
were
thicker
yet
quicker
in
spite
of
that
the
traffic
policeman
had
a
hard
time
for
the
people
were
independent
they
retained
some
habits
of
the
old
period
and
would
cross
the
street
anywhere
and
anyhow
which
not
only
got
them
killed
more
frequently
than
if
they
clung
to
the
legal
crossings
but
kept
the
motormen
the
chauffeurs
and
the
in
a
stew
of
profane
nervousness
so
the
traffic
policemen
led
harried
lives
they
themselves
were
killed
of
course
with
a
certain
periodicity
but
their
main
trouble
was
that
they
could
not
make
the
citizens
realize
that
it
was
actually
and
mortally
perilous
to
go
about
their
city
it
was
strange
for
there
were
probably
no
citizens
of
any
length
of
residence
who
had
not
personally
known
either
some
one
who
had
been
killed
or
injured
in
an
accident
or
some
one
who
had
accidentally
killed
or
injured
others
and
yet
perhaps
it
was
not
strange
seeing
the
sharp
preoccupation
of
the
faces
the
people
had
something
on
their
minds
they
could
not
stop
to
bother
about
dirt
and
danger
mary
vertrees
was
not
often
she
had
never
seen
an
accident
until
this
afternoon
she
had
come
upon
errands
for
her
mother
connected
with
a
timorous
refurbishment
and
as
she
did
these
in
and
out
of
the
department
stores
she
had
an
insistent
consciousness
of
the
sheridan
building
from
the
street
anywhere
it
was
almost
always
in
sight
like
some
monstrous
geometrical
shadow
and
rising
limitlessly
into
the
swimming
heights
of
the
it
was
gaunt
and
grimy
and
repellent
it
had
nothing
but
strength
and
size
but
in
that
consciousness
of
mary
the
great
structure
may
have
partaken
of
beauty
sheridan
had
made
some
of
the
things
he
said
emphatic
enough
to
remain
with
her
she
went
over
and
over
them
and
they
began
to
seem
true
one
girl
he
could
feel
that
sorry
for
says
he
got
you
on
his
brain
so
bad
the
man
clumsy
talk
began
to
sing
in
her
heart
the
song
was
begun
there
when
she
saw
the
accident
she
was
directly
opposite
the
sheridan
building
then
waiting
for
the
traffic
to
thin
before
she
crossed
though
other
people
were
risking
the
passage
darting
and
halting
and
dodging
parlously
two
men
came
from
the
crowd
behind
her
talking
earnestly
and
started
across
both
wore
black
one
was
tall
and
broad
and
thick
and
the
other
was
taller
but
noticeably
slender
and
mary
caught
her
breath
for
they
were
bibbs
and
his
father
they
did
not
see
her
and
she
caught
a
phrase
in
mellow
voice
which
had
taken
a
crisper
ring
thousand
dollars
not
thousand
buttons
it
startled
her
queerly
and
as
there
was
a
glimpse
of
his
profile
she
saw
for
the
first
time
a
resemblance
to
his
father
she
watched
them
in
the
middle
of
the
street
bibbs
had
to
step
ahead
of
his
father
and
the
two
were
separated
but
the
reckless
passing
of
a
truck
beyond
the
second
line
of
rails
frightened
a
group
of
country
women
who
were
in
course
of
passage
they
were
just
in
front
of
bibbs
and
shoved
backward
upon
him
violently
to
extricate
himself
from
them
he
stepped
back
directly
in
front
of
a
moving
no
place
for
but
bibbs
was
still
absorbed
in
thoughts
concerned
with
what
he
had
been
saying
to
his
father
there
were
shrieks
and
yells
bibbs
looked
the
wrong
way
and
then
mary
saw
the
heavy
figure
of
sheridan
plunge
straight
forward
in
front
of
the
car
with
absolute
disregard
of
his
own
life
he
hurled
himself
at
bibbs
like
a
shunting
off
an
opponent
and
to
mary
it
seemed
that
they
both
went
down
together
but
that
was
all
she
could
see
automobiles
trucks
and
wagons
closed
in
between
she
made
out
that
the
stopped
jerkily
and
she
saw
a
policeman
breaking
his
way
through
the
instantly
condensing
crowd
while
the
traffic
came
to
a
standstill
and
people
stood
up
in
automobiles
or
climbed
upon
the
hubs
and
tires
of
wheels
not
to
miss
a
chance
of
seeing
anything
horrible
mary
tried
to
get
through
it
was
impossible
other
policemen
came
to
help
the
first
and
in
a
minute
or
two
the
traffic
was
in
motion
again
the
crowd
became
pliant
dispersing
there
was
no
figure
upon
the
ground
and
no
ambulance
came
but
one
of
the
policemen
was
detained
by
the
clinging
and
beseeching
of
a
gloved
hand
is
the
matter
lady
are
they
mary
cried
ole
man
sheridan
i
reckon
he
was
much
hurt
son
that
who
the
other
one
was
i
seen
him
knock
him
oh
he
not
bad
off
i
guess
lady
the
ole
man
got
him
out
of
the
way
all
right
the
fender
shoved
the
ole
man
around
some
but
i
reckon
he
only
got
shook
up
they
both
went
on
in
the
sheridan
building
without
any
help
excuse
me
sheridan
and
bibbs
in
fact
were
at
that
moment
in
the
elevator
ascending
up
in
the
office
sheridan
was
saying
got
to
look
out
on
those
corners
nowadays
i
tell
you
i
do
know
i
got
any
call
to
blow
though
because
i
tried
to
cross
after
you
did
how
i
happened
to
run
into
you
well
you
want
to
remember
to
look
out
after
this
we
were
talkin
about
murtrie
askin
thousand
flat
for
that
lease
it
his
lookout
if
he
rather
take
it
that
way
and
i
do
know
but
said
bibbs
emphatically
as
the
elevator
stopped
wo
get
it
not
from
us
he
wo
and
i
show
you
why
i
can
convince
you
in
five
he
followed
his
father
into
the
office
anteroom
and
convinced
him
then
having
been
diligently
brushed
by
a
youth
of
color
bibbs
went
into
his
own
room
and
closed
the
door
he
was
more
shaken
than
he
had
allowed
his
father
to
perceive
and
his
side
was
sore
where
sheridan
had
struck
him
he
desired
to
be
alone
he
wanted
to
rub
himself
and
for
once
to
do
some
useless
thinking
again
he
knew
that
his
father
had
not
to
run
into
him
he
knew
that
sheridan
had
instantly
and
instinctively
proved
that
he
held
his
own
life
of
no
account
whatever
compared
to
that
of
his
son
and
heir
bibbs
had
been
unable
to
speak
of
that
or
to
seem
to
know
it
for
sheridan
just
as
instinctively
had
swept
the
matter
aside
as
of
no
importance
since
all
was
well
reverting
immediately
to
business
bibbs
began
to
think
intently
of
his
father
he
perceived
as
he
had
never
perceived
before
the
shadowing
of
something
enormous
and
indomitable
and
lawless
not
to
be
daunted
by
the
will
of
very
self
laughing
at
the
lightning
and
at
wounds
and
mutilation
conquering
irresistible
and
blindly
noble
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
bibbs
began
to
understand
the
meaning
of
being
truly
this
son
he
would
be
the
more
truly
his
son
henceforth
though
as
sheridan
said
bibbs
had
not
come
with
him
meanly
or
he
had
given
his
word
because
he
had
wanted
the
money
simply
for
mary
vertrees
in
her
need
and
he
shivered
with
horror
of
himself
thinking
how
he
had
gone
to
her
to
offer
it
asking
her
to
marry
him
with
his
head
on
his
breast
in
shameful
fear
that
she
would
accept
him
he
had
not
known
her
the
knowing
had
lost
her
to
him
and
this
had
been
his
real
awakening
for
he
knew
now
how
deep
had
been
that
slumber
wherein
he
dreamily
celebrated
the
superiority
of
the
had
wakened
to
bitter
knowledge
of
love
and
life
finding
himself
a
failure
in
both
he
had
made
a
burnt
offering
of
his
dreams
and
the
sacrifice
had
been
an
unforgivable
hurt
to
mary
all
that
was
left
for
him
was
the
work
he
had
not
chosen
but
at
least
he
would
not
fail
in
that
though
it
was
indeed
no
more
than
in
his
if
there
had
been
anything
work
for
he
went
to
the
window
raised
it
and
let
in
the
uproar
of
the
streets
below
he
looked
down
at
the
blurred
hurrying
swarms
and
he
looked
across
over
the
roofs
with
their
panting
jets
of
vapor
into
the
vast
foggy
heart
of
the
smoke
dizzy
traceries
of
steel
were
rising
dimly
against
it
chattering
with
steel
on
steel
and
screeching
in
steam
while
tiny
figures
of
men
walked
on
threads
in
the
dull
sky
buildings
would
overtop
the
sheridan
bigness
was
being
served
but
what
for
the
old
question
came
to
bibbs
with
a
new
despair
here
where
his
eyes
fell
had
once
been
green
fields
and
running
brooks
and
how
had
the
kind
earth
been
despoiled
and
disfigured
the
pioneers
had
begun
the
work
but
in
their
old
age
their
orators
had
said
for
them
that
they
had
toiled
and
risked
and
sacrificed
that
their
posterity
might
live
in
peace
and
wisdom
enjoying
the
fruits
of
the
earth
well
their
posterity
was
here
and
there
was
only
turmoil
where
was
the
promised
land
it
had
been
promised
by
the
soldiers
of
all
the
wars
it
had
been
promised
to
this
generation
by
the
pioneers
but
here
was
the
very
posterity
to
whom
it
had
been
promised
toiling
and
risking
and
sacrificing
in
turn
for
what
the
harsh
roar
of
the
city
came
in
through
the
open
window
continuously
beating
upon
bibbs
ear
until
he
began
to
distinguish
a
pulsation
in
it
a
broken
and
irregular
cadence
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
like
a
titanic
voice
discordant
hoarse
rustily
metallic
the
voice
of
the
god
bigness
and
the
voice
summoned
bibbs
as
it
summoned
all
its
servants
and
work
it
seemed
to
yell
and
work
for
me
all
men
by
your
youth
and
your
hope
i
summon
you
by
your
age
and
your
despair
i
summon
you
to
work
for
me
yet
a
little
with
what
strength
you
have
by
your
love
of
home
i
summon
you
by
your
love
of
woman
i
summon
you
by
your
hope
of
children
i
summon
you
shall
be
blind
slaves
of
mine
blind
to
everything
but
me
your
master
and
driver
for
your
reward
you
shall
gaze
only
upon
my
ugliness
you
shall
give
your
toil
and
your
lives
you
shall
go
mad
for
love
and
worship
of
my
ugliness
you
shall
perish
still
worshipping
me
and
your
children
shall
perish
knowing
no
other
god
and
then
as
bibbs
closed
the
window
down
tight
he
heard
his
voice
booming
in
the
next
room
he
could
not
distinguish
the
words
but
the
tone
was
exultant
and
there
came
the
thump
thump
of
the
maimed
hand
bibbs
guessed
that
sheridan
was
bragging
of
the
city
and
of
bigness
to
some
visitor
from
and
he
thought
how
truly
sheridan
was
the
high
priest
of
bigness
but
with
the
old
old
thought
again
for
bibbs
caught
a
glimmer
of
far
faint
light
he
saw
that
sheridan
had
all
his
life
struggled
and
conquered
and
must
all
his
life
go
on
struggling
and
inevitably
conquering
as
part
of
a
vast
impulse
not
his
own
sheridan
served
blindly
but
was
the
impulse
blind
bibbs
asked
himself
if
it
was
not
he
who
had
been
in
the
greater
hurry
after
all
the
kiln
must
be
fired
before
the
vase
is
glazed
and
the
acropolis
was
not
crowned
with
marble
in
a
day
then
the
voice
came
to
him
again
but
there
was
a
strain
in
it
as
of
some
high
music
struggling
to
be
born
of
the
turmoil
i
am
it
seemed
to
say
to
him
never
forget
that
i
am
a
god
and
the
voice
grew
in
sonorousness
and
in
dignity
highest
should
serve
but
so
long
as
you
worship
me
for
my
own
sake
i
will
not
serve
you
it
is
man
who
makes
me
ugly
by
his
worship
of
me
if
man
would
let
me
serve
him
i
should
be
beautiful
looking
once
more
from
the
window
bibbs
sculptured
for
himself
in
the
vague
contortions
of
the
smoke
and
fog
above
the
roofs
a
gigantic
figure
with
feet
pedestaled
upon
the
great
buildings
and
shoulders
disappearing
in
the
clouds
a
colossus
of
steel
and
wholly
blackened
with
soot
but
bibbs
carried
his
fancy
further
for
there
was
still
a
little
poet
lingering
in
the
back
of
his
head
and
he
thought
that
up
over
the
clouds
unseen
from
below
the
giant
labored
with
his
hands
in
the
clean
sunshine
and
bibbs
had
a
glimpse
of
what
he
made
there
perhaps
for
a
fellowship
of
the
children
of
the
children
that
were
children
now
a
noble
and
joyous
city
unbelievably
white
it
was
the
telephone
that
called
him
from
his
vision
it
rang
fiercely
he
lifted
the
thing
from
his
desk
and
answered
and
as
the
small
voice
inside
it
spoke
he
dropped
the
receiver
with
a
crash
he
trembled
violently
as
he
picked
it
up
but
he
told
himself
he
was
wrong
he
had
been
mistaken
yet
it
was
a
startlingly
beautiful
voice
startlingly
kind
too
and
ineffably
like
the
one
he
hungered
most
to
hear
he
said
his
own
voice
shaking
like
his
hand
he
responded
with
two
hushed
and
incredulous
words
it
there
was
a
little
thrill
of
pathetic
in
the
instrument
i
wanted
to
just
to
see
if
you
mary
was
looking
when
you
were
so
nearly
run
over
i
saw
it
bibbs
they
said
you
had
been
hurt
they
thought
but
i
wanted
to
know
for
no
i
was
hurt
at
all
mary
it
was
father
who
came
nearer
it
he
saved
i
saw
but
you
had
fallen
i
could
get
through
the
crowd
until
you
had
gone
and
i
wanted
to
would
you
have
minded
he
said
there
was
a
long
interval
before
she
answered
why
bibbs
do
know
what
to
say
he
cried
so
wonderful
to
hear
your
voice
again
i
shaking
mary
i
i
do
know
i
do
know
anything
except
that
i
am
talking
to
you
it
is
you
mary
bibbs
i
seen
you
from
my
window
at
home
only
five
times
since
i
since
then
you
looked
oh
how
can
i
tell
you
it
was
like
a
man
chained
in
a
cave
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
blue
sky
mary
mary
you
let
me
see
you
again
near
i
think
i
could
make
you
really
forgive
me
you
have
to
did
not
really
or
you
would
have
said
you
could
see
me
any
was
the
the
voice
was
very
low
he
said
even
more
tremulously
than
before
ca
you
could
mean
it
was
because
you
ca
mean
it
was
because
you
care
there
was
no
answer
he
called
huskily
you
mean
that
you
let
me
see
you
would
you
and
now
the
voice
was
so
low
he
could
not
be
sure
it
spoke
at
all
but
if
it
did
the
words
were
bibbs
but
the
voice
was
not
in
the
instrument
it
was
so
gentle
and
so
light
so
almost
nothing
it
seemed
to
be
made
of
air
and
it
came
from
the
air
slowly
and
incredulously
he
turned
and
glory
fell
upon
his
shining
eyes
the
door
of
his
father
room
had
opened
mary
stood
upon
the
threshold
the
end
