chapter
i
the
hobo
at
chazy
junction
judkins
the
station
agent
at
chazy
junction
came
out
of
his
little
house
at
daybreak
shivered
a
bit
in
the
chill
morning
air
and
gave
an
involuntary
start
as
he
saw
a
private
car
on
the
sidetrack
there
were
two
private
cars
to
be
exact
a
sleeper
and
a
baggage
car
and
judkins
knew
the
three
train
must
have
left
them
as
it
passed
through
ah
said
he
aloud
the
nabobs
hev
arrove
who
are
the
nabobs
asked
a
quiet
voice
beside
him
again
judkins
started
he
even
stepped
back
a
pace
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
stranger
who
had
approached
so
stealthily
through
the
dim
light
that
the
agent
was
unaware
of
his
existence
until
he
spoke
who
be
you
he
demanded
eyeing
the
man
suspiciously
never
mind
who
i
am
retorted
the
other
in
a
grumpy
tone
the
original
question
is
are
the
nabobs
see
here
young
feller
this
ai
no
place
fer
tramps
observed
judkins
frowning
with
evident
displeasure
chazy
junction
got
all
it
kin
do
to
support
its
inhabitants
you
hev
to
move
on
the
stranger
sat
down
on
a
baggage
truck
and
eyed
the
private
car
reflectively
he
wore
a
rough
gray
suit
baggy
and
threadbare
a
flannel
shirt
with
an
old
black
tie
carelessly
knotted
at
the
collar
a
brown
felt
hat
with
several
holes
in
the
crown
and
coarse
cowhide
shoes
that
had
arrived
at
the
last
stages
of
usefulness
you
would
judge
him
to
be
from
to
thirty
years
of
age
you
would
note
that
his
face
was
browned
from
exposure
that
it
was
rather
set
and
expressionless
but
in
no
way
repulsive
his
eyes
dark
and
retrospective
were
his
most
redeeming
feature
yet
betrayed
little
of
their
owner
character
judkins
could
make
nothing
of
the
fellow
beyond
the
fact
that
he
was
doubtless
a
tramp
and
on
that
account
most
unwelcome
in
this
retired
neighborhood
even
tramps
were
unusual
at
chazy
junction
the
foothills
were
sparsely
settled
and
the
inhabitants
too
humble
to
be
attractive
to
gentlemen
of
the
road
while
the
rocky
highways
tortuous
and
uneven
offered
no
invitation
to
the
professional
pedestrian
you
hev
to
move
on
repeated
the
agent
more
sternly
i
ca
replied
the
other
with
a
smile
the
car
i
was
er
attached
to
has
come
to
a
halt
the
engine
has
left
us
and
here
we
are
i
and
the
nabobs
ridin
the
trucks
eh
no
rear
platform
very
comfortable
it
was
and
no
interruptions
the
crazy
old
train
stopped
so
many
times
during
the
night
that
i
scarcely
woke
up
when
they
sidetracked
us
here
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
was
abandoned
in
this
wilderness
as
it
grew
light
i
began
to
examine
my
surroundings
and
discovered
you
glad
to
meet
you
sir
you
need
be
do
begrudge
me
the
pleasure
i
implore
you
i
ca
blame
you
for
being
gruff
and
unsociable
were
you
otherwise
you
would
reside
at
at
he
turned
his
head
to
read
the
half
legible
sign
on
the
station
house
at
chazy
junction
i
familiar
with
most
parts
of
the
united
states
but
chazy
junction
gets
my
flutters
why
oh
why
in
the
world
did
it
happen
judkins
scowled
but
made
no
answer
he
was
wise
enough
to
understand
he
was
no
match
in
conversation
for
this
irresponsible
outcast
who
knew
the
great
world
as
perfectly
as
the
agent
knew
his
junction
he
turned
away
and
stared
hard
at
the
silent
sleeper
the
appearance
of
which
was
not
wholly
unexpected
you
have
informed
me
who
the
nabobs
are
nor
why
they
choose
to
be
sidetracked
in
this
forsaken
remarked
the
stranger
eyeing
the
bleak
hills
around
him
in
the
growing
light
of
dawn
the
agent
hesitated
his
first
gruff
resentment
had
been
in
a
manner
disarmed
and
he
dearly
loved
to
talk
especially
on
so
interesting
a
subject
as
the
nabobs
he
knew
he
could
astonish
the
tramp
and
the
temptation
to
do
so
was
too
strong
to
resist
it
the
great
john
merrick
who
got
millions
to
burn
but
do
light
many
bonfires
he
began
not
very
graciously
at
first
two
years
ago
he
bought
the
wegg
farm
over
by
millville
an
where
millville
inquired
the
man
seven
mile
back
in
the

farm

cobblestone

but
how

new
york
an
peggy
mcnutt
over
millville
says
it
must
cost
a
the
tramp
nodded
somewhat
listlessly
i
feel
quite
respectable
this
morning
having
passed
the
night
as
the
guest
of
a
millionaire
he
observed
merrick
did
know
it
of
course
or
he
would
have
invited
me
inside
like
enough
answered
the
agent
seriously
the
nabob
thet
reckless
an
unaccountable
he
likely
to
do
worse
ner
that
that
what
makes
him
an
his
gals
interestin
nobody
in
quarries
how
about
breakfast
friend
judkins
that

business
an
not

ef

traveler

the
yonder
an
buy
your
like
a
man
thank
you
i
may
follow
your
advice
the
agent
walked
up
the
track
and
put
out
the
semaphore
lights
for
the
sun
was
beginning
to
rise
over
the
hills
by
the
time
he
came
back
a
colored
porter
stood
on
the
platform
of
the
private
car
and
nodded
to
him

retorted
the
agent
scornfully
you
wo
git
sick
you
too
well
paid
fer
that
the
porter
grinned
and
just
then
a
little
old
gentleman
with
a
rosy
cheery
face
pushed
him
aside
and
trotted
down
the
steps
mornin
judkins
he
cried
and
shook
the
agent
hand
what
a
glorious
sunrise
and
what
crisp
delicious
air
ah
but
it
good
to
be
in
old
chazy
county
again
the
agent
straightened
up
his
face
wreathed
with
smiles
and
cast
an
i
told
you
so
glance
toward
the
man
on
the
truck
but
the
stranger
had
disappeared
chapter
ii
the
invasion
of
millville
over
the
brow
of
the
little
hill
appeared
a
wagon
drawn
by
a
pair
of
handsome
sorrels
and
in
a
moment
the
equipage
halted
beside
the
sleeper
oh
thomas
hucks
you
dear
dear
thomas
cried
a
clear
eager
voice
and
out
from
the
car
rushed
miss
patricia
doyle
to
throw
her
arms
about
the
neck
of
the
old
and
driver
whose
face
was
illumined
by
a
joyous
smile
glad
to
see
ye
miss
patsy
right
glad
child
returned
the
old
man
but
others
were
waiting
to
greet
him
pretty
beth
de
graf
and
dainty
louise
merrick
not
louise
merrick
any
longer
though
but
bearing
a
new
name
she
had
recently
acquired
and
demure
mary
little
maid
and
an
old
friend
of
thomas
hucks
and
uncle
john
with
his
merry
laugh
and
cordial
handshake
and
finally
a
tall
and
rather
dandified
young
man
who
remained
an
interested
spectator
in
the
background
until
merrick
seized
and
dragged
him
forward
here
another
for
you
to
know
thomas
said
the
little
millionaire
this
is
the
other
half
of
our
louise
arthur
weldon
and
by
and
by
you
can
judge
whether
he
the
better
half
or
not
the
aged
servant
hat
in
hand
made
a
respectful
bow
to
weldon
his
frank
eyes
swept
the
young
man
from
head
to
foot
but
his
smile
was
the
same
as
before
miss
louise
is
wiser
ner
i
be
said
the
old
fellow
simply
i
safe
to
trust
to
her
jedgment
i
guess
there
was
a
general
laugh
at
this
and
they
began
to
clamber
aboard
the
wagon
and
to
stow
away
beneath
the
seats
the
luggage
the
colored
porter
was
bringing
out
stop
at
the
junction
house
thomas
said
merrick
as
they
moved
away
nora

the
breakfast

home
sir
replied
thomas
good

but
we
ca
fast
until
we
reach

eight
good
miles
of
jolting
so

a
glass
of
todd

the
way
sir
and
he
get
the
liveryman
to
help
if
he
carry
it
all
the
junction
house
was
hidden
from
the
station
by
the
tiny
hill
as
were
the
half
dozen
other
buildings
tributary
to
chazy
junction
as
the
wagon
drew
up
before
the
long
piazza
which
extended
along
the
front
of
the
little
frame
inn
they
saw
a
man
in
shabby
gray
seated
at
a
small
table
with
some
bread
and
a
glass
of
milk
before
him
it
was
their
unrecognized
guest
of
the
night
the
uninvited
lodger
on
the
rear
platform
but
he
did
not
raise
his
eyes
or
appear
to
notice
the
new
arrivals
todd
hey
mrs
todd
called
uncle
john
anybody
milked
the
cow
yet
a
frowsy
looking
woman
came
out
all
smiles
and
nodded
pleasantly
at
the
expectant
group
in
the
wagon
behind
her
loomed
the
tall
lean
form
of
lucky
todd
the
proprietor
who
was
serious
as
a
goat
which
animal
he
closely
resembled
in
feature
breakfas
all
mr
merrick
asked
the
woman
not
this
time
todd
nora
has
our
breakfast
waiting
for
us
but
we
want
some
of
your
delicious
milk
to
last
us
to
the
farm
las
night
milkin
half
cream
by
this
time
she
rejoined
as
she
briskly
reentered
the
house
the
man
at
the
table
held
out
his
empty
glass
here
fill
this
up
he
said
to
lucky
todd
the
proprietor
turned
his
gaze
from
the
merrick
group
to
the
stranger
eyed
him
pensively
a
moment
and
then
faced
the
wagon
again
the
man
in
gray
got
up
placed
the
empty
glass
in
todd
hand
whirled
him
around
facing
the
door
and
said
sternly
more
milk
the
landlord
walked
in
like
an
automaton
and
a
suppressed
giggle
came
from
the
girls
in
the
wagon
uncle
john
was
likewise
amused
and
despite
the
unknown
frazzled
apparel
the
little
millionaire
addressed
him
in
the
same
tone
he
would
have
used
toward
an
equal
do
blame
you
sir
nobody
ever
tasted
better
milk
than
they
have
at
the
junction
house
the
man
who
had
resumed
his
seat
stood
up
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
but
he
made
no
reply
out
came
todd
accompanied
by
another
frowsy
woman
between
them
they
bore
a
huge
jug
of
milk
a
number
of
thick
glasses
and
a
plate
of
crackers
the
crackers
come
extry
merrick
said
the
landlady
but
as
milk
cheap
i
thought
you
might
like
the
landlord
now
came
out
and
placed
the
stranger
glass
about
half
filled
with
milk
on
the
table
before
him
the
man
looked
at
it
frowned
and
tossed
off
the
milk
in
one
gulp
more
he
said
holding
out
the
glass
todd
shook
his
head
ai
no
more
he
declared
his
wife
overheard
him
and
pausing
in
her
task
of
refilling
the
glasses
for
the
rich
man
party
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
said
give
him
what
he
wants
lucky
the
landlord
pondered
not
fer
ten
cents
nancy
he
protested
the
feller
said
he
wanted
ten
cents
wuth
o
breakfas
an
by
joe
he
had
it

remarked
todd
it

as
is
expensive
these
days
fill
up
his
glass
lucky
why
is
your
husband
called
mrs
todd
inquired
patsy
who
was
enjoying
the
cool
creamy
milk
he
got
me
to
manage
him
i
guess
was
the
laughing
reply
todd
ai
much
i
on
the
spot
to
order
him
the
landlord
came
out
with
the
glass
of
milk
but
paused
before
he
set
it
down
let
see
your
money
he
said
suspiciously
it
seemed
to
the
girls
who
were
curiously
watching
the
scene
that
the
tramp
flushed
under
his
bronzed
skin
but
without
reply
he
searched
in
a
pocket
and
drew
out
four
copper
cents
which
he
laid
upon
the
table
after
further
exploration
he
abstracted
a
nickel
from
another
pocket
and
pushed
the
coins
toward
the
landlord
cent
said
todd
continued
search
seemed
for
a
time
hopeless
but
at
last
in
quite
an
unexpected
way
the
man
produced
the
final
cent
and
on
receiving
it
todd
set
down
the
milk
anything
more
yer
honor
he
asked
sarcastically
yes
you
might
bring
me
the
morning
paper
was
the
reply
everyone
except
todd
laughed
frankly
at
this
retort
uncle
john
put
two
silver
dollars
in
todd
chubby
hand
and
told
thomas
to
drive
on
i
dunno
remarked
old
hucks
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
whether
that
feller
jest
a
common
tramp
or
a
workman

over
to
the
paper
mill

royal
jedgin
from
the
fact
as
he
had

beth
seated
just
behind
him
did
you
notice
his
hands
no
miss
beth
they
were
not
rough
and
the
fingers
were
slender
and
delicate
that
the
mark
of
a
cracksman
said
arthur
weldon
with
a
laugh
if
there
are
any
safes
out
here
that
are
worth
cracking
i
say
look
out
for
the
gentleman
his
face
is
bad
at
all
remarked
patsy
reflectively
is
there
any
grade
between
a
workman
and
a
thief
of
course
asserted
merrick
in
his
brisk
way
this
fellow
shabby
as
he
looked
might
be
anything
from
a
strolling
artist
to
a
gentleman

on
his
luck

inter

an
the
waterfall
would
do
the
grindin
so
he
bought
a
mile
o
forest
an
built
a
mill
an
they
do
say
things
is
hummin
up
to
the
new
settlement
there
more
two
hundred
hands
there
goodness
me
cried
patsy
this
thing
must
have
livened
up
sleepy
old
millville
considerably
not
yet
said
hucks
shaking
his
head
the
what
owns
the
mill
keeps
a
store
there
for
the
workmen
an
none
of
come
much
to
millville
our
storekeepers
is
blazes
about
it
but
fer
my
part
i
glad
the
two
places
is
separated
why
asked
louise
they
a
kinder
tough
lot
i
guess
turnin
pine
trees
inter
paper
mus
be
a
job
thet
takes
more
muscle
than
brains
i
do
see
how
done
at
all
it
simple
enough
said
merrick
first
the
wood
is
ground
into
pulp
and
then
the
pulp
is
run
through
hot
rollers
coming
out
paper
it
a
mighty
interesting
process
so
some
day
we
will
all
go
to
royal
and
see
the
paper
made
but
not
just
yet
uncle
remarked
patsy
let
have
time
to
settle
down
on
the
farm
and
enjoy
it
oh
how
glad
i
am
to
be
back
in
this
restful
sleepy
of
the
world
again
is
it
delightful
arthur
weldon
did
you
ever
breathe
such
ozony
delicious
mountain
air
and
do
you
get
the
fragrance
of
the
pine
forests
and
the
the
the
bumps
asked
arthur
as
the
wagon
gave
a
jolt
a
bit
more
emphatic
than
usual
yes
patsy
dear
i
get
them
all
but
i
wo
pass
judgment
on
millville
and
uncle
john
farm
just
yet
are
we
there
we
to
have
four
whole
months
of
it
sighed
beth
that
ought
to
enable
us
to
renew
our
youth
after
the
strenuous
winter
rubbish
said
uncle
john
you
have
known
a
strenuous
moment
my
dears
and
you
all
too
young
to
need
renewals
anyhow
but
if
you
can
find
happiness
here
my
girls
our
old
farm
will
become
a
paradise
these
three
nieces
of
merrick
were
well
worth
looking
at
louise
the
eldest
was
now
twenty
entirely
too
young
to
be
a
bride
but
having
decided
to
marry
arthur
weldon
the
girl
would
brook
no
interference
and
having
a
will
of
her
own
overcame
all
opposition
her
tall
slender
form
was
exceedingly
graceful
and
willowy
her
personality
dainty
and
refined
her
temperament
under
ordinary
conditions
essentially
sweet
and
agreeable
in
crises
louise
developed
considerable
character
in
strong
contrast
with
her
usual
assumption
of
composure
that
the
girl
was
insincere
in
little
things
and
cultivated
a
polished
manner
to
conceal
her
real
feelings
is
undeniable
but
in
spite
of
this
she
might
be
relied
upon
to
prove
loyal
and
true
in
emergencies
patricia
doyle
was
more
than
two
years
the
junior
of
her
cousin
louise
and
very
unlike
her
patsy
old
father
major
gregory
doyle
said
she
wore
her
heart
on
her
sleeve
and
the
girl
was
frank
and
outspoken
to
a
fault
patsy
had
no
figure
to
speak
of
being
somewhat
dumpy
in
build
nor
were
her
piquant
features
at
all
beautiful
her
nose
tipped
at
the
end
her
mouth
was
broad
and
and
her
complexion
badly
freckled
but
patsy
hair
was
of
that
indescribable
shade
that
hovers
between
burnished
gold
and
sunset
carmine
fiery
red
she
was
wont
to
describe
it
and
most
people
considered
it
very
justly
one
of
her
two
claims
to
distinction
her
other
admirable
feature
was
a
pair
of
magnificent
deep
blue
eyes
merry
mischievous
and
scintillating
as
diamonds
few
could
resist
those
eyes
and
certain
it
is
that
patsy
doyle
was
a
universal
favorite
and
won
friends
without
a
particle
of
effort
the
younger
of
the
three
nieces
elizabeth
de
graf
was
as
beautiful
a
girl
as
you
will
often
discover
one
of
those
rarely
perfect
creations
that
excite
our
wonder
and
compel
admiration
as
a
beautiful
picture
or
a
bit
of
statuary
will
dreamy
and
reserved
in
disposition
she
lacked
the
graciousness
of
louise
and
patsy
compelling
good
humor
yet
you
must
not
think
her
stupid
or
disagreeable
her
reserve
was
really
diffidence
her
dreamy
expressionless
gaze
the
result
of
a
serious
nature
and
a
thoughtful
temperament
beth
was
quite
practical
and
the
reverse
of
patsy
imaginative
instincts
or
affected
indifference
those
who
knew
beth
de
graf
best
loved
her
dearly
but
strangers
found
her
hard
to
approach
and
were
often
repulsed
by
her
unresponsive
manner
underneath
all
the
girl
was
a
real
girl
with
many
splendid
qualities
and
uncle
john
relied
upon
stability
more
than
on
that
of
his
other
two
nieces
her
early
life
had
been
a
stormy
and
unhappy
one
so
she
was
but
now
developing
her
real
nature
beneath
the
warmth
of
her
uncle
protecting
love
topping
the
brow
of
a
little
hill
the
wagon
came
to
a
smooth
downward
grade
where
the
road
met
the
quaint
old
bridge
that
spanned
little
bill
creek
beside
which
stood
the
antiquated
flour
and
feed
mill
that
had
given
millville
its
name
the
horses
were
able
to
maintain
their
brisk
trot
across
the
bridge
and
through
the
main
street
of
the
town
which
was
merely
a
cluster
of
unimposing
frame
buildings
that
lined
either
side
of
the
highway
for
the
space
of
an
ordinary
city
block
then
they
were
in
the
wilds
again
and
rattling
over
another
cobblestone
trail
this
country
but
pine
woods
cobblestones
sighed
old
hucks
as
the
horses
subsided
to
a
walk
lor
knows
what
would
happened
to
us
without
the
trees
they
saves
our
grace
so
to
speak
i
think
the
scenery
is
beautiful
observed
patsy
it
so
different
from
other
country
places
not
much
farming
around
here
i
imagine
said
arthur
weldon
more
than
you
think
sir
replied
thomas
there
certain
crops
as
thrives
in
stony
land
an
a
few
miles
north
o
here
towards
huntingdon
the
soil
mighty
rich
productive
things
ai
never
as
bad
as
they
seem
in
this
world
sir
he
added
turning
his
persistently
smiling
face
toward
the
young
man
merrick
sat
beside
the
driver
on
the
front
seat
the
middle
seat
was
occupied
by
patsy
and
beth
between
whom
squeezed
little
mary
the
maid
louise
and
arthur
had
the
back
seat
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
the
town
they
came
to
a
sort
of
lane
running
at
right
angles
with
the
turnpike
and
down
this
lane
old
hucks
turned
his
team
it
seemed
like
a
forbidding
prospect
for
ahead
of
them
loomed
only
a
group
of
tall
pines
marking
the
edge
of
the
forest
yet
as
they
came
nearer
and
made
a
little
bend
in
the
road
the
wegg
farm
suddenly
appeared
in
view
the
house
seemed
so
cozy
and
homelike
set
upon
its
green
lawn
with
the
tall
pines
for
a
background
that
the
girls
who
knew
the
place
well
exclaimed
with
delight
and
arthur
who
now
saw
it
for
the
first
time
nodded
his
head
approvingly
uncle
john
was
all
excitement
over
the
arrival
at
his
country
home
an
old
fashioned
stile
was
set
in
a
rail
fence
which
separated
the
grounds
from
the
lane
and
hucks
drew
up
the
wagon
so
his
passengers
could
all
alight
upon
the
step
of
the
stile
patsy
was
out
at
a
bound
louise
followed
more
deliberately
assisted
by
her
boy
husband
and
beth
came
more
sedately
yet
but
uncle
john
rode
around
to
the
barn
with
thomas
being
eager
to
see
the
cows
and
pigs
and
poultry
with
which
the
establishment
was
liberally
stocked
the
house
was
of
two
stories
the
lower
being
built
of
cobblestones
and
the
upper
of
pine
slabs
but
it
had
been
artistically
done
and
the
effect
was
delightful
it
was
a
big
rambling
dwelling
and
merrick
had
furnished
the
old
place
in
a
lavish
manner
so
that
his
nieces
would
lack
no
modern
comfort
when
they
came
there
to
spend
a
summer
on
the
porch
stood
an
old
woman
clothed
in
a
neat
gingham
dress
and
wearing
a
white
apron
and
cap
her
pleasant
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
as
she
turned
it
toward
the
laughing
chattering
group
that
came
up
the
path
patsy
spied
her
and
rushed
up
to
give
old
nora
a
hug
and
kiss
and
the
other
two
girls
saluted
the
blind
woman
with
equal
cordiality
for
long
ago
she
had
won
the
love
and
devotion
of
all
three
arthur
who
had
heard
of
nora
pressed
her
hand
and
told
her
she
must
accept
him
as
another
of
her
children
and
then
she
asked
for
merrick
and
ran
in
to
get
the
breakfast
served
for
although
blind
old
nora
was
far
from
being
helpless
and
the
breakfast
she
had
prepared
in
anticipation
of
their
arrival
was
as
deliciously
cooked
as
if
she
had
been
able
to
use
her
eyes
as
others
did
chapter
iii
the
dawn
of
a
great
enterprise
the
great
enterprise
was
sprung
on
merrick
the
very
morning
following
his
arrival
at
the
farm
breakfast
was
over
and
a
group
had
formed
upon
the
shady
front
lawn
where
chairs
benches
and
hammocks
were
scattered
in
profusion
well
uncle
how
do
you
like
it
asked
louise
are
you
perfectly
comfortable
and
happy
now
we
escaped
so
far
from
the
city
that
its
humming
life
is
a
mere
memory
happy
as
a
clam
responded
uncle
john
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
feet
on
a
foot
rest
if
i
only
had
the
morning
paper
there
would
be
nothing
else
to
wish
for
the
paper
that
what
that
queer
tramp
at
the
junction
house
asked
for
remarked
beth
the
first
thought
of
even
a
hobo
was
for
a
morning
paper
i
wonder
why
men
are
such
slaves
to
those
gossipy
things
phoo
cried
patsy
we
all
slaves
to
them
show
me
a
person
who
does
read
the
daily
journals
and
keep
abreast
of
the
times
and
show
you
a
dummy
patsy
right
remarked
arthur
weldon
the
general
intelligence
and
cosmopolitan
knowledge
of
the
people
are
best
cultivated
by
the
newspapers
the
superiority
of
our
newspapers
has
been
a
factor
in
making
us
the
greatest
nation
on
earth
for
we
are
the
best
informed
my
what
big
words
exclaimed
louise
it
is
quite
true
said
uncle
john
soberly
that
i
shall
miss
our
daily
paper
during
our
four
months
retirement
in
these
fascinating
wilds
it
the
one
luxury
we
ca
enjoy
in
our
country
retreat
why
not
asked
patsy
with
startling
abruptness
while
a
queer
expression
as
of
an
inspiration
stole
over
her
bright
face
chump
said
beth
drily
you
know
very
well
why
not
patsy
doyle
mooley
cows
and
the
fourth
estate
do
intermingle
so
to
speak
they
can
be
made
to
though
declared
patsy
why
has
some
one
thought
of
it
before
uncle
john
girls
i
propose
we
start
a
daily
paper
louise
laughed
softly
beth
lip
curled
and
arthur
weldon
cast
an
amused
glance
at
the
girl
but
uncle
john
stared
seriously
into
questioning
blue
eyes
how
he
asked
in
a
puzzled
tone
if
anything
could
interest
this
eccentric
little
millionaire
more
than
the
usual
trend
of
events
it
was
an
original
proposition
of
this
sort
he
loved
to
do
things
that
other
people
had
not
attempted
nor
even
thought
of
he
hated
conversational
platitudes
and
established
conventions
and
his
nieces
had
endeared
themselves
to
him
more
by
their
native
originality
and
frank
disregard
of
ordinary
feminine
limitations
than
in
any
other
way
it
was
generally
conceded
that
patsy
was
his
favorite
because
she
could
advance
more
odd
suggestions
than
the
other
girls
and
this
niece
had
a
practical
aptitude
for
carrying
out
her
whimsical
ideas
that
had
long
since
won
her
uncle
respect
not
that
she
could
outdo
merrick
in
eccentricity
that
was
admitted
to
be
his
special
province
in
which
he
had
no
rival
but
the
girl
was
so
clever
a
confederate
that
she
gave
her
erratic
uncle
much
happiness
of
the
sort
he
most
appreciated
therefore
this
seemingly
preposterous
proposition
to
establish
a
daily
paper
on
a
retired
country
farm
did
not
strike
the
old
gentleman
as
utterly
impossible
and
anything
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
was
sure
to
meet
his
earnest
consideration
especially
when
it
was
proposed
by
one
of
his
favorite
nieces
how
responded
patsy
why
it
easy
enough
uncle
we
buy
a
press
hire
a
printer
and
beth
and
louise
will
help
me
edit
the
paper
i
sure
i
can
exhibit
literary
talents
of
a
high
order
once
they
are
encouraged
to
sprout
louise
writes
lovely
poetry
and
of
human
interest
and
beth
i
ca
write
even
a
good
letter
asserted
that
young
lady
but
dearly
love
to
edit
a
newspaper
of
course
agreed
louise
we
all
would
and
i
think
we
could
turn
out
a
very
creditable
paper
for
millville
but
would
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
that
is
the
present
question
replied
uncle
john
the
main
thing
is
do
you
girls
want
to
be
tied
down
to
such
a
task
every
day
in
the
week
all
during
our
summer
holiday
why
you
made
our
whole
lives
a
holiday
uncle
john
interrupted
patsy
and
we
been
so
coddled
and
swamped
with
luxuries
that
we
are
just
now
in
serious
danger
of
being
spoiled
you
do
want
three
spoiled
nieces
on
your
hands
do
you
and
please
make
allowance
for
our
natural
impetuosity
and
eagerness
to
be
up
and
doing
we
love
the
farm
but
our
happiness
here
would
be
doubled
if
we
had
some
occupation
to
keep
us
busy
and
this
philanthropic
undertaking
would
furnish
us
with
no
end
of
fun
even
while
we
were
benefiting
our
fellow
man
all
jabber
dear
exclaimed
beth
i
admit
the
fun
but
where
does
the
philanthropy
come
in
do
you
see
asked
patsy
both
uncle
john
and
that
tramp
we
encountered
have
met
on
common
ground
to
bewail
the
lack
of
a
daily
newspaper
our
midst
to
speak
in
journalistic
parlance
at
the
paper
mill
at
royal
are
over
two
hundred
workmen
moaning
in
despair
while
they
lose
all
track
of
the
world
progress
at
huntingdon
not
five
miles
distant
are
four
or
five
hundred
people
lacking
all
the
educational
advantages
of
an
or
is
proper
press
and
millville
good
gracious
what
would
sleepy
millville
folks
think
of
having
a
bright
newsy
metropolitan
newspaper
left
on
their
doorsteps
every
morning
or
evening
as
the
case
may
be
said
uncle
john
i
scent
a
social
revolution
in
the
wilds
of
chazy
county
let
start
it
right
away
cried
patsy
the
tribune
what
do
you
say
girls
why
asked
louise
because
we
three
will
run
it
and
we
a
triumvirate
the
future
tribunal
of
the
people
in
this
district
very
good
said
uncle
john
nodding
approval
a
clever
idea
patsy
but
it
all
nonsense
sir
observed
arthur
weldon
in
astonishment
have
you
any
idea
of
the
details
of
this
thing
you
are
proposing
none
whatever
said
the
little
millionaire
that
the
beauty
of
the
scheme
arthur
it
may
lead
us
into
a
complicated
and
the
joy
of
getting
untangled
ought
to
repay
us
for
all
our
bother
perhaps
so
if
you
ever
untangle
said
the
young
man
smiling
at
the
whimsical
speech
then
he
turned
to
his
young
bride
do
you
want
to
go
into
this
thing
louise
he
asked
of
course
i
do
she
promptly
replied
it
the
biggest
thing
in
the
way
of
a
sensation
that
patsy
crazy
brain
has
ever
evolved
and
stand
by
the
to
the
last
you
must
forget
arthur
that
i
shall
be
able
to
publish
all
my
verses
and
stories
which
the
century
and
harpers
so
heartlessly
turned
down
and
beth
oh
i
in
it
too
declared
beth
there
something
so
delightfully
mysterious
and
bewildering
in
the
idea
of
our
editing
and
printing
a
daily
paper
here
in
millville
that
i
can
hardly
wait
to
begin
the
experiment
it
no
experiment
whatever
asserted
patsy
boldly
the
daily
newspaper
is
an
established
factor
in
civilization
and
man
has
done
man
can
do
an
adage
that
applies
equally
to
girls
have
you
any
notion
of
the
cost
of
an
outfit
such
as
is
required
to
print
a
modern
daily
asked
arthur
oh
two
or
three
hundred
perhaps
but
you
crazy
child
that
would
buy
the
type
nevertheless
began
patsy
argumentatively
but
her
uncle
stopped
her
you
need
figure
on
that
he
said
hastily
the
outfit
shall
be
my
contribution
to
the
enterprise
if
you
girls
say
you
anxious
and
willing
to
run
a
newspaper
i
agree
to
give
you
a
proper
start
oh
thank
you
uncle
of
course
we
willing
it
is
all
absolutely
settled
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
said
patsy
firmly
how
long
will
it
take
to
get
the
things
here
uncle
merrick
considered
a
moment
there
a
telephone
over
at
cotting
general
store
in
town
he
said
i
drive
over
and
get
major
doyle
on
the
wire
and
have
him
order
the
stuff
sent
out
at
once
oh
no
protested
patsy
do
tell
daddy
of
this
plan
please
think
we
were
all
fit
subjects
for
the
lunatic
asylum
major
doyle
would
be
far
wrong
in
that
conclusion
suggested
arthur
i
like
to
surprise
him
by
sending
him
the
first
copy
of
the
added
the
major
daughter
then
said
merrick
i
call
up
marvin
my
banker
he
perhaps
attend
to
the
matter
more
understandingly
and
more
promptly
than
the
major
would
tell
hucks
to
harness
joe
to
the
buggy
patsy
and
i
go
at
once
we
all
go
exclaimed
beth
of
course
added
louise
we
are
all
equally
interested
in
this
venture
so
patsy
had
old
hucks
hitch
joe
to
the
surrey
and
the
three
girls
accompanied
their
uncle
in
his
drive
to
town
leaving
arthur
weldon
shaking
his
head
in
a
deprecating
way
but
fully
realizing
that
no
protest
of
his
would
avail
to
prevent
this
amazing
undertaking
that
old
man
is
as
much
a
child
as
beth
or
patsy
he
reflected
it
puzzles
me
to
explain
how
he
made
all
those
millions
with
so
little
worldly
wisdom
chapter

the
way
into

sam
cotting
general
store
at
millville
divided
importance
with
bob
west
hardware
store
but
was
a
more
popular
loafing
place
for
the
sparse
population
of
the
tiny
town
the
post
office
was
located
in
one
corner
and
the
telephone
booth
in
another
and
this
latter
institution
was
regarded
with
much
awe
by
the
simple
natives
once
in
awhile
some
one
would
telephone
over
to
the
junction
on
some
trivial
business
but
the
call
was
never
employed
except
by
the
nabobs
the
local
name
for
john
merrick
and
his
nieces
or
by
the
manager
of
the
new
mill
at
royal
who
had
extended
the
line
to
his
own
office
in
the
heart
of
the
pine
forest
so
when
uncle
john
and
the
girls
entered
cotting
store
and
the
little
gentleman
shut
himself
up
in
the
telephone
booth
a
ripple
of
excitement
spread
throughout
the
neighborhood
skim
clark
the
youthful
hope
of
the
widow
clark
who
run
the
emporium
happened
to
be
in
the
store
and
he
rushed
out
to
spread
the
news
that
the
nabob
talkin
to
new
yoruk
this
information
demanded
immediate
attention
marshall
mcmahon
mcnutt
familiarly
known
as
peggy
mcnutt
because
he
had
once
lost
a
foot
in
a
mowing
machine
and
who
was
alleged
to
be
a
real
estate
agent
horse
doctor
fancy
poultry
breeder
and
palmist
and
who
also
dabbled
in
the
sale
of
subscription
books
life
insurance
liniment
and
watermelons
quickly
slid
off
his
front
porch
across
the
way
and
sauntered
into
cotting
to
participate
in
the
excitement
seth
davis
the
blacksmith
dropped
his
tools
and
hurried
to
the
store
and
the
druggist
three
doors
away
a
dapper
gentleman
known
as
nib
corkins
hurriedly
locked
his
door
and
attended
the
meeting
presently
the
curious
group
was
enlarged
by
the
addition
of
nick
thome
the
liveryman
lon
taft
a
carpenter
and
general
and
silas
caldwell
the
miller
the
latter
a
serious
individual
who
had
jest
happened
to
come
acrost
from
the
mill
in
the
nick
o
time
sam
cotting
being
himself
of
great
local
importance
had
never
regarded
with
favor
the
rivalry
of
the
nabob
but
he
placed
stools
near
the
telephone
booth
for
the
three
girls
who
accepted
the
courtesy
with
a
graciousness
that
ought
to
have
disarmed
the
surly
storekeeper
they
could
not
fail
to
be
amused
at
the
interest
they
excited
and
as
they
personally
knew
every
one
of
the
town
people
they
pleasantly
nodded
to
each
arrival
and
inquired
after
their
health
and
the
welfare
of
their
families
the
replies
were
monosyllables
millville
folks
were
diffident
in
the
presence
of
these
city
visitors
and
while
they
favored
the
girls
with
rather
embarrassing
stares
their
chief
interest
was
centered
on
the
little
man
in
the
telephone
booth
who
could
plainly
be
seen
through
the
glass
door
but
might
not
be
heard
however
loudly
he
shouted
talkin
to
new
yoruk
was
yet
a
marvelous
thing
to
them
and
much
speculation
was
exchanged
in
low
tones
as
to
the
probable
cost
of
such
a
conversation
as
merrick
was
now
indulging
in
costs
a
dollar
to
connect
ye
know
remarked
peggy
mcnutt
to
ned
long
bet
a
cookie
he
runnin
the
blame
bill
up
to
two
dollars
with
all
this
chinnin
why
ca
th
ol
nabob
write
a
letter
like
common
folks
an
give
his
extry
cash
to
the
poor
meanin
you
peggy
asked
nib
corkins
with
a
chuckle
he
might
do
wuss
ner
that
retorted
peggy
lor
knows
i
poor
enough
you
do
ketch
to
new
york
at
a
dollar
a
throw
nib
do
ye
meantime
merrick
had
succeeded
in
getting
marvin
of
the
banking
house
of
isham
marvin
on
the
wire
do
me
a
favor
marvin
he
said
hunt
up
the
best
supply
house
and
have
them
send
me
a
complete
outfit
to
print
a
daily
newspaper
everything
must
be
modern
you
know
and
do
let
them
leave
out
anything
that
might
come
handy
then
go
to
corrigan
the
superintendent
of
the
railroad
and
have
him
send
the
freight
up
here
to
chazy
junction
by
a
special
engine
for
i
do
want
a
moment
delay
and
the
regular
freight
takes
a
week
or
so
charge
everything
to
my
account
and
impress
upon
the
dealer
the
need
of
haste
understand
all
that
marvin
i
think
i
do
sir
was
the
reply
but
that
a
pretty
big
order
merrick
the
outfit
for
a
modern
daily
will
cost
a
small
fortune
never
mind
send
it
along
very
well
but
you
better
give
me
some
details
how
big
a
newspaper
do
you
want
to
print
hold
the
wire
and
i
find
out
said
uncle
john
then
he
opened
the
door
of
the
booth
and
said
patsy
how
big
a
thing
do
you
want
to
print
how
big
oh
let
me
see
four
pages
will
do
wo
it
louise
plenty
i
should
say
for
this
place
answered
louise
and
how
many
columns
to
a
page
asked
uncle
john
oh
six
or
seven
that
regular
i
guess
make
it
six
proposed
beth
that
will
keep
us
busy
enough
all
right
said
uncle
john
and
closed
the
door
again
this
conversation
was
of
the
most
startling
nature
to
the
assembled
villagers
who
were
all
trying
to
look
unconcerned
and
as
if
jest
dropped
in
but
were
unable
to
dissemble
their
curiosity
successfully
of
course
much
of
this
interchange
of
words
between
the
man
in
the
booth
and
the
girls
outside
was
greek
to
them
all
but
to
print
and
columns
and
pages
could
apply
only
to
one
idea
which
while
not
fully
grasped
was
tremendously
startling
in
its
suggestion
the
merrick
party
was
noted
for
doing
astonishing
things
in
the
past
and
evidently
in
the
words
of
peggy
mcnutt
they
were
up
to
some
blame
foolishness
that
either
kill
this
neighborhood
or
make
it
talked
about
it
too
dead
to
kill
responded
nick
thorne
gloomily
even
the
paper
mill
four
mile
away
ai
managed
to
make
millville
wiggle
its
big
toe
do
you
worry
over
what
the
nabob
do
peggy
he
could
hurt
nuthin
if
he
tried
the
door
opened
again
and
merrick
protruded
a
puzzled
countenance
he
wants
to
know
about
a
stereotype
plant
patsy
what
i
tell
him
patsy
stared
louise
and
beth
shook
their
heads
if
it
belongs
to
the
the
thing
we
want
uncle
have
send
it
along
said
patsy
in
desperation
all
right
a
few
minutes
later
the
little
man
again
appealed
to
them
how
we
run
the
thing
girls
steam
or
electricity
patsy
face
was
a
blank
beth
giggled
and
louise
frowned
of
course
it
have
to
be
run
suggested
merrick
but
how
that
the
question
i
i
had
given
that
matter
thought
admitted
patsy
what
do
you
think
uncle
he
considered
holding
open
the
door
while
he
thoughtfully
regarded
the
silent
but
interested
group
of
villagers
that
eagerly
hung
upon
every
word
that
passed
cotting
called
merrick
how
do
they
run
the
paper
mill
at
royal
sir
answered
half
a
dozen
at
once
they
develops
the
power
from
the
royal
waterfall
of
the
little
bill
explained
cotting
with
slow
and
pompous
deliberation
skeelty
he
tol
me
they
had
enough
to
light
up
the
whole
dum
country
fer
ten
mile
in
all
directions
of
the
mill
who
skeelty
manager
o
the
mill
sir
an
part
owner
he
says
has
he
a
telephone
yes
mr
merrick
thank
you
merrick
shut
the
door
and
called
up
skeelty
five
minutes
of
bargaining
settled
the
question
and
he
then
connected
with
marvin
again
and
directed
him
to
have
the
presses
and
machinery
equipped
to
run
by
electricity
thinking
he
had
now
given
the
banker
all
the
commissions
he
could
attend
to
with
celerity
uncle
john
next
called
up
major
doyle
and
instructed
his
to
send
four
miles
of
electric
cable
with
fittings
and
transformers
and
a
crew
of
men
to
do
the
work
and
not
to
waste
a
moment
time
in
getting
them
to
millville
what
in
blazes
are
ye
up
to
now
john
inquired
the
major
on
receiving
this
order
none
of
your
business
gregory

orders
going
to
light
the
farm
and
turn
night
into
day
persisted
the
major
this
is
patsy
secret
and
i
not
going
to
give
it
away
said
merrick
attend
to
this
matter
promptly
major
and
you
see
the
result
when
you
come
to
us
in
july
for
your
vacation
having
attended
to
all
the
requirements
of
the
projected
as
he
thought
merrick
called
the
operator
for
the
amount
of
his
bill
and
paid
it
to
sam
cotting
three
dollars
and
eighty
cents
the
sum
fairly
made
the
onlookers
gasp
and
as
the
merrick
party
passed
out
silas
the
miller
said
solemnly
do
anybody
tell
me
talk
is
cheap
arter
this
john
merrick
may
be
a
millionaire
but
ef
he
keeps
this

on

big
scale
four
pages
an
six
columns
to
a
page
asked
cotting
scornfully
sounds
to
me
more
like
a
newspaper
folks
there
was
a
moment
silence
during
which
they
all
stared
at
the
speaker
fearfully
then
said
skim
clark
in
his
drawling
halting
way
ef
thet
the
case
an
there
goin
ter
be
a
newspaper
here
in
millville
we
may
as
well
give
up
the
struggle
fer
the
town
be
ruined
chapter
v
dividing
the
responsibility
the
rest
of
that
day
and
a
good
share
of
the
night
was
devoted
to
an
earnest
consultation
concerning
the
proper
methods
of
launching
the
daily
we
must
divide
the
work
said
patsy
so
that
all
will
have
an
equal
share
of
responsibility
louise
is
to
be
the
literary
editor
and
the
society
editor
that
sounds
like
a
good
combination
there
is
no
society
here
objected
louise
not
as
we
understand
the
term
perhaps
replied
miss
doyle
but
every
community
however
small
believes
it
is
a
social
center
and
so
it
is
to
itself
if
there
is
a
dance
or
a
prayer
meeting
or
a
christening
or
illness
it
must
be
recorded
in
our
local
columns
if
bob
west
sells
a
plow
we
got
to
mention
the
name
of
the
farmer
who
bought
it
if
there
a
wedding
we
make
a
of
it
if
a
baby
is
born
we
will
will
print
its
picture
in
the
paper
eh
uncle
john
this
from
beth
of
course
said
merrick
you
must
print
all
the
home
news
as
well
as
the
news
of
the
world
how
are
you
going
to
get
the
news
of
the
world
asked
arthur
how
how
that
was
my
question
private
wire
from
new
york
said
merrick
as
the
girls
hesitated
how
to
meet
this
problem
i
arrange
with
the
telegraph
company
to
have
an
extension
of
the
wire
run
over
from
chazy
junction
then
we
hire
an
operator
a
girl
of
course
to
receive
the
news
in
the
office
of
the
paper
but
who
will
send
us
the
news
asked
beth
the
associated
press
i
suppose
or
some
news
agency
in
new
york
telegraph
to
marvin
to
arrange
it
arthur
whistled
softly
this
newspaper
is
going
to
cost
something
he
murmured
uncle
john
looked
at
him
with
a
half
quizzical
half
amused
expression
that
what
marvin
warned
me
yesterday
when
i
ordered
the
equipment
said
he
he
told
me
that
before
i
got
through
with
this
deal
it
would
run
up
into
the
thousands
and
he
added
that
millville
was
worth
it
and
what
did
you
say
to
that
uncle
john
asked
beth
in
that
case
i
said
i
would
be
sure
to
get
some
pleasure
and
satisfaction
out
of
your
journalistic
enterprise
my
last
financial
statement
showed
a
frightful
condition
of
affairs
in
spite
of
major
doyle
reckless
investments
of
my
money
and
and
the
little
we
manage
to
give
to
deserving
charities
i
getting
richer
every
day
when
a
small
leak
like
this
newspaper
project
occurs
it
seems
that
fortune
is
patting
me
on
the
back
i
no
idea
what
a
respectable
newspaper
will
cost
but
i
hope
it
will
cost
a
lot
for
every
dollar
it
devours
makes
my
mind
just
that
much
easier
arthur
weldon
laughed
in
that
case
sir
said
he
i
can
make
no
further
protest
but
i
predict
you
will
find
the
bills
eh
eh
entirely
satisfactory
you
mentioned
an
office
just
now
uncle
observed
louise
must
we
have
a
business
office
to
be
sure
merrick
replied
we
must
find
a
proper
location
where
we
can
install
the
presses
and
all
the
type
and
machinery
that
go
to
making
up
a
newspaper
i
had
thought
of
this
before
but
it
is
a
serious
matter
my
dears
we
may
have
to
build
a
place
oh
that
would
take
too
long
entirely
said
patsy
ca
we
put
it
in
the
barn
uncle
what
would
happen
to
the
horses
and
cows
no
we
take
a
look
over
millville
and
see
what
we
can
find
there
you
wo
find
much
predicted
beth
i
ca
think
of
a
single
unoccupied
building
in
the
town
then
we
put
it
in
a
tent
declared
patsy
do
borrow
trouble
advised
uncle
john
wait
till
we
gone
over
the
ground
together
our
truck
will
require
a
pretty
big
place
for
marvin
said
one
freight
car
would
hold
all
the
outfit
he
going
to
send
two
cars
anyhow
have
him
fill
up
the
second
with
print
paper
proposed
arthur
ah
that
another
thing
i
had
thought
of
said
merrick
how
big
a
daily
edition
will
you
print
patsy
let
see
pondered
the
girl
there
are
about
two
hundred
at
royal
say
four
hundred
at
huntingdon
at
millville
about
about
say
fifteen
said
uncle
john
that
six
hundred
and
fifteen
and
and
the
farmers
of
course
there
must
be
at
least
a
hundred
and
fifty
of
in
the
county
so
that
makes
seven
hundred
and
copies
a
day
wait
a
moment
cried
arthur
somewhat
bewildered
by
this
figuring
do
you
suppose
every
inhabitant
man
woman
and
child
will
subscribe
for
your
paper
patsy
blushed
why
no
of
course
not
she
acknowledged
frankly
how
many
do
you
think
subscribe
arthur
remember
it
to
be
a
great
newspaper
four
pages
of
six
columns
each
plenty
big
enough
for
millville
he
said
thoughtfully
my
advice
girls
is
to
print
a
first
edition
of
about
four
hundred
copies
and
distribute
the
papers
free
in
every
house
within
a
radius
of
five
or
six
miles
from
millville
these
will
be
samples
and
after
the
people
have
had
a
chance
to
read
them
you
can
ask
them
to
subscribe
by
the
way
what
will
you
charge
for
subscription
how
much
uncle
asked
patsy
appealingly
a
penny
paper
is
the
most
popular
he
said
regarding
her
with
merry
twinkling
eyes
say
thirty
cents
a
month
or
a
year
as
much
as
these
poor
people
can
stand
i
think
so
too
replied
the
girl
seriously
but
it
seems
to
me
a
penny
paper
is
dignified
pouted
louise
i
had
intended
to
print
all
my
poems
in
it
and
i
sure
that
ought
to
make
it
worth
at
least
five
cents
a
copy
that
will
make
it
worth
more
my
dear
commented
uncle
john
but
frequently
one
must
sell
property
for
less
than
it
actually
worth
you
must
remember
these
people
have
not
been
used
to
spending
much
money
on
literature
and
i
imagine
you
have
to
coax
them
to
spend
thirty
cents
a
month
many
of
the
big
new
york
papers
are
sold
for
a
penny
and
without
any
loss
of
dignity
either
do
you
think
we
can
make
it
pay
on
that
basis
uncle
asked
beth
uncle
john
coughed
to
gain
time
while
he
thought
of
a
suitable
reply
that
my
dear
he
informed
his
niece
will
depend
upon
how
many
subscribers
you
can
get
subscribers
and
advertisers
are
necessary
to
make
any
paper
pay
advertisers
of
course
said
practical
beth
every
merchant
in
millville
and
huntingdon
will
naturally
advertise
in
our
paper
and
we
make
the
major
get
us
a
lot
from
new
york
oh
said
patsy
i
see
so
difficulty
is
settled
arthur
smiled
but
held
his
peace
uncle
john
round
face
was
growing
merrier
every
minute
patsy
do
you
think
we
shall
make
any
money
from
this
venture
asked
louise
we
ought
to
if
we
put
our
hearts
and
souls
into
the
thing
was
the
reply
but
before
we
divide
any
profits
we
must
pay
back
to
uncle
john
the
original
investment
we
do
especially
care
to
make
any
profit
do
we
inquired
beth
it
fun
for
us
you
know
and
a
a
great
educational
experience
and
and
a
fine
philanthropy
and
all
that
we
do
need
the
money
so
if
the
paper
pays
a
profit
at
a
cent
a
copy
we
better
cut
down
the
price
do
do
that
yet
advised
uncle
john
soberly
there
will
be
expenses
that
as
yet
you
do
suspect
and
a
penny
for
a
paper
is
about
as
low
as
you
can
go
what
to
be
my
position
on
the
staff
patsy
asked
beth
turning
to
her
cousin
you
a
good
mathematician
beth
so
i
propose
you
act
as
secretary
and
treasurer
and
keep
the
books
no
that
too
mechanical
no
bookkeeping
for
me
i
want
something
literary
then
you
can
be
sporting
editor
goodness
patsy
there
will
be
no
sporting
news
in
millville
there
will
be
a
ball
game
occasionally
and
i
saw
some
of
the
men
pitching
quoits
yesterday
but
this
is
to
be
a
newspaper
reflecting
the
excitement
of
the
entire
world
beth
and
all
the
telegraphic
news
of
a
sporting
character
you
must
edit
and
arrange
for
our
reading
columns
oh
yes
and
you
take
care
of
the
religious
items
too
we
must
have
a
sunday
sermon
by
some
famous
preacher
uncle
we
print
that
every
saturday
so
those
who
ca
go
to
church
may
get
as
good
a
talk
as
if
they
did
and
perhaps
a
better
one
that
will
be
fine
he
agreed
how
about
murders
crimes
and
divorces
all
barred
nothing
that
sends
a
cold
chill
down
your
back
will
be
allowed
in
our
paper
these
people
are
delightfully
simple
we
want
to
spoil
them
cut
out
the
cold
chills
and
you
spoil
your
newspaper
suggested
arthur
people
like
to
read
of
other
folks
horrors
for
it
makes
them
more
contented
with
their
own
lot
in
life
false
philosophy
sir
cried
fatsy
firmly
you
ca
educate
people
by
retailing
crimes
and
scandals
and
the
is
going
to
be
as
clean
as
a
prayer
book
if
i
to
be
managing
editor
is
that
to
be
your
office
dear
asked
louise
i
think
so
i
a
heap
of
executive
ability
and
i
running
over
with
literary
eh
eh
literary
discrimination
in
addition
to
running
the
thing
i
be
the
general
news
editor
because
i
better
posted
on
newspaper
business
than
the
other
girls
how
does
that
happen
inquired
louise
wonderingly
why
i
i
the
papers
more
than
you
or
beth
and
i
set
myself
to
master
every
detail
of
the
business
no
more
crocheting
or
fancy
work
no
novel
reading
no
gossipy
letter
writing
from
this
day
on
we
must
attend
strictly
to
business
if
we
to
become
journalist
girls
we
must
be
good
ones
better
than
the
ordinary
so
that
uncle
john
may
point
to
us
with
pride
and
the
columns
of
the
daily
will
be
quoted
by
the
new
york
and
chicago
press
only
in
that
way
can
we
become
famous
throughout
the
world
pass
me
the
bonbons
dear
sighed
louise
it
a
high
ambition
it
a
very
laudable
ambition
added
uncle
john
approvingly
i
hope
my
clever
nieces
will
be
able
to
accomplish
it
how
about
pictures
asked
beth
modern
newspapers
are
illustrated
and
have
cartoons
of
the
leading
events
of
the
day
ca
we
buy
those
things
somewhere
asked
patsy
appealing
to
uncle
john
again
there
is
an
artist
among
us
of
any
account
and
we
shall
be
too
busy
to
draw
pictures
we
must
hire
an
artist
said
merrick
adding
the
item
to
his
memoranda
i
speak
to
marvin
about
it
all
these
details
were
beginning
to
bewilder
the
embryo
journalists
it
is
quite
possible
that
had
not
uncle
john
placed
his
order
for
presses
and
type
so
promptly
the
girls
might
have
withdrawn
from
the
proposition
but
the
die
was
now
cast
and
they
were
too
brave
perhaps
too
stubborn
to
back
down
at
this
juncture
i
realize
said
patsy
slowly
and
with
a
shake
of
her
flaming
head
that
we
have
undertaken
an
important
venture
our
new
enterprise
is
a
most
serious
one
girls
for
there
is
nothing
greater
or
grander
in
our
advanced
age
than
the
daily
newspaper
no
power
so
tremendous
as
the
power
of
the
press
yes
the
press
must
be
powerful
or
it
would
print
clearly
remarked
beth
we
are
to
become
public
mentors
to
the
simple
natives
of
chazy
county
continued
patsy
warming
up
to
her
subject
and
speaking
oratorically
we
shall
be
the
guiding
star
of
the
er
er
the
benighted
citizens
of
millville
and
huntingdon
we
must
lead
them
in
politics
counsel
them
in
the
management
of
their
farms
and
educate
them
to
the
great
world
movements
that
are
constantly
occurring
let
put
all
that
rot
in
our
prospectus
said
louise
looking
at
her
cousin
admiringly
can
you
remember
it
patsy
or
had
i
better
write
it
down
now
i
like
that
about
teaching
the
farmers
how
to
run
their
farms
it
so
practical
you
wait
said
patsy
unflinchingly
i
write
an
editorial
that
will
make
their
eyes
roll
but
it
wo
do
a
bit
of
harm
for
you
and
beth
to
jot
down
all
the
brilliant
thoughts
you
run
across
for
the
benefit
of
our
subscribers
we
have
any
subscribers
yet
remarked
beth
placidly
i
overcome
that
defect
said
uncle
john
i
want
to
subscribe
right
now
for
ten
copies
to
be
mailed
to
friends
of
mine
in
the
city
who
who
need
educating
i
pay
in
advance
and
collect
of
my
friends
when
i
see
this
was
certainly
encouraging
and
patsy
smiled
benignantly
i
take
five
more
yearly
subscriptions
said
arthur
oh
but
you
going
to
be
on
the
staff
cried
patsy
am
i
certainly
i
been
thinking
over
our
organization
and
while
it
is
quite
proper
for
three
girls
to
run
paper
there
ought
to
be
a
man
to
pose
as
the
editor
in
chief
that
be
you
arthur
but
you
wo
print
my
name
oh
yes
we
shall
do
groan
sir
it
no
disgrace
wait
till
you
see
the
also
we
shall
print
our
own
names
in
that
case
giving
credit
to
whom
credit
is
due
the
announcement
will
run
something
like
this
weldon
general
manager
and
editor
in
chief
doyle
general
news
editor
merrick
weldon
society
and
literary
editor
degraf
sporting
editor
secretary
and
treasurer
you
see
by
using
our
initials
only
no
one
will
ever
suspect
we
are
girls
the
millville
people
may
said
arthur
slyly
and
perhaps
the
disguise
will
be
penetrated
by
outsiders
that
will
depend
on
the
paper
i
do
like
that
combination
of
sporting
editor
and
secretary
and
treasurer
objected
beth
it
is
the
usual
thing
in
journalism
sure
suppose
you
call
me
editor
of
special
features
and
let
it
go
at
that
have
we
any
special
features
asked
louise
oh
yes
said
arthur
there
beth
eyebrows
patsy
nose
and
do
be
sensible
cried
patsy
this
is
a
joking
matter
sir
our
newspaper
will
have
plenty
of
special
features
and
beth
suggestion
is
a
good
one
it
sounds
impressive
you
see
arthur
we
got
to
use
you
as
a
figurehead
but
so
you
wo
loaf
on
your
job
i
decided
to
appoint
you
solicitor
of
advertising
and
subscriptions
thank
you
my
dear
he
said
grinning
in
an
amused
way
you
and
louise
who
still
like
to
be
together
can
drive
all
over
the
county
getting
subscriptions
and
you
can
write
letters
on
our
new
stationery
to
all
the
big
manufacturers
of
soaps
and
breakfast
foods
and
beauty
powders
and
to
all
the
correspondence
schools
and
get
their
advertisements
for
the
if
you
get
a
good
many
we
may
have
to
enlarge
the
paper
do
worry
miss
doyle
i
try
to
keep
within
bounds
and
so
they
went
on
laying
plans
and
discussing
details
in
such
an
earnest
way
that
uncle
john
became
as
enthusiastic
as
any
of
them
and
declared
in
no
uncertain
tone
that
the
daily
was
bound
to
be
a
howling
success
after
the
girls
had
retired
for
the
night
and
the
men
sat
smoking
together
in
uncle
john
own
room
arthur
said
tell
me
sir
why
you
have
encouraged
this
mad
project
the
little
millionaire
puffed
his
pipe
in
silence
a
moment
then
he
replied
i
educating
my
girls
to
be
energetic
and
i
want
to
bring
out
and
develop
every
spark
of
latent
ability
there
is
in
them
whether
the
succeeds
or
fails
is
not
important
it
will
at
least
keep
them
busy
for
a
time
along
new
lines
and
tax
their
best
resources
of
intellect
and
business
ability
in
other
words
this
experience
is
bound
to
do
good
and
in
that
way
i
figure
it
will
be
worth
all
it
costs
and
more
i
like
the
originality
of
the
idea
pleased
with
the
difficulties
i
see
looming
ahead
i
quite
sure
my
girls
will
rise
to
every
occasion
and
prove
their
grit
he
paused
to
knock
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
i
worth
a
lot
of
money
arthur
he
continued
meekly
and
some
day
these
three
girls
will
inherit
immense
fortunes
it
is
my
duty
to
train
them
in
all
practical
business
ways
to
take
care
of
their
property
i
follow
your
line
of
reasoning
sir
observed
arthur
weldon
but
this
absurd
journalistic
venture
is
bound
to
result
in
heavy
financial
loss
i
know
it
my
boy
i
sure
of
it
but
ca
you
see
that
the
lesson
they
will
learn
will
render
them
more
cautious
in
making
future
investments
i
going
to
supply
a
complete
newspaper
outfit
to
the
last
detail
and
give
a
good
running
start
then
i
shall
sit
back
and
watch
results
if
they
lose
money
on
running
expenses
as
they
surely
will
they
first
take
it
out
of
their
allowances
then
sell
their
jewelry
and
finally
come
to
me
for
help
see
the
lesson
will
be
worth
while
arthur
and
aside
from
that
think
of
the
fun
have
chapter
vi
skeelty
of
the
mill
the
next
morning
they
drove
to
town
again
passing
slowly
up
the
street
of
the
little
village
to
examine
each
building
that
might
be
a
possible
location
for
a
newspaper
office
here
is
a
map
that
patsy
drew
of
millville
which
gives
a
fair
idea
of
its
arrangement
illustration
village
street
counting
the
dwellings
there
were
exactly
twelve
buildings
and
they
all
seemed
occupied
when
they
reached
the
hardware
store
opposite
cotting
west
the
proprietor
was
standing
on
the
broad
platform
in
front
of
it
in
many
respects
bob
west
was
the
most
important
citizen
of
millville
tall
and
gaunt
with
great
horn
spectacles
covering
a
pair
of
cold
gray
eyes
he
was
usually
as
reserved
and
silent
as
his
neighbors
were
confiding
and
talkative
a
widower
of
long
standing
without
children
or
near
relatives
he
occupied
a
suite
of
rooms
over
the
hardware
store
and
took
his
meals
at
the
hotel
before
merrick
appeared
on
the
scene
west
had
been
considered
a
very
wealthy
man
as
it
was
known
he
had
many
interests
outside
of
his
store
but
compared
with
the
old
bob
had
come
to
be
regarded
more
modestly
although
still
admitted
to
be
the
village
warmest
citizen
he
was
an
authority
in
the
town
too
and
a
man
of
real
importance
merrick
stopped
his
horse
to
speak
with
the
hardware
man
an
old
acquaintance
west
said
he
my
girls
are
going
to
start
a
newspaper
in
millville
the
merchant
bowed
gravely
perhaps
to
cover
the
trace
of
a
smile
he
was
unable
to
repress
it
to
be
a
daily
paper
you
know
continued
merrick
and
it
seems
there
a
lot
of
machinery
in
the
outfit
it
need
quite
a
bit
of
room
in
other
words
and
we
looking
for
a
place
to
install
it
west
glanced
along
the
street
up
one
side
and
down
the
other
and
then
shook
his
head
negatively
plenty
of
land
but
no
buildings
said
he
you
might
buy
the
old
mill
and
turn
it
into
a
newspaper
office
caldwell
is
making
much
of
a
living
and
would
be
glad
to
sell
out
it
too
dusty
and
floury
said
patsy
we
never
get
it
clean
sure
what
in
that
shed
of
yours
asked
uncle
john
pointing
to
a
long
low
building
that
adjoined
the
hardware
store
west
turned
and
looked
at
the
shed
reflectively
that
is
where
i
store
my
stock
of
farm
machinery
he
said
very
little
in
there
now
for
it
a
poor
season
and
i
did
lay
in
much
of
a
supply
in
fact
i
pretty
well
cleaned
out
of
all
surplus
stock
but
next
spring
i
shall
need
the
place
again
good
cried
merrick
that
solves
our
problem
has
it
a
floor
yes
an
excellent
one
but
only
one
small
window
we
can
remedy
that
declared
uncle
john
here
the
proposition
west
let
us
have
the
shed
for
six
months
at
the
end
of
which
time
we
will
know
whether
the
is
a
success
or
not
if
it
is
we
build
a
fine
new
building
for
it
if
it
do
seem
to
prosper
we
give
you
back
the
shed
what
do
you
say
west
thought
it
over
there
is
room
on
the
rear
platform
for
all
the
farm
machinery
i
now
have
on
hand
all
right
merrick
i
move
the
truck
out
and
give
you
possession
it
wo
make
a
bad
newspaper
office
but
of
course
you
are
to
fit
up
the
place
at
your
own
expense
thank
you
very
much
sir
exclaimed
uncle
john
i
set
lon
taft
at
work
at
once
where
can
he
be
found
playing
billiards
at
the
hotel
usually
i
suppose
he
is
there
now
very
good
i
hunt
him
up
what
do
you
think
of
our
newspaper
scheme
west
the
old
merchant
hesitated
then
he
said
slowly
whatever
your
charming
and
energetic
nieces
undertake
sir
will
doubtless
be
well
accomplished
the
typical
country
newspaper
groans
under
a
load
of
debt
and
seldom
gets
a
fair
show
to
succeed
but
in
this
case
there
will
be
no
lack
of
money
and
why
that
settles
the
question
i
think
money
is
the
keystone
to
success
west
said
louise
with
dignity
we
are
depending
chiefly
on
the
literary
merit
of
our
newspaper
to
win
recognition
of
course
of
course
said
he
hastily
put
me
down
as
a
subscriber
please
and
rely
upon
my
support
at
all
times
it
is
possible
young
ladies
nay
quite
probable
i
should
say
that
your
originality
and
genius
will
yet
make
millville
famous
that
speech
pleased
uncle
john
and
as
the
hardware
merchant
bowed
and
turned
away
merrick
said
in
his
cheeriest
tones
he
quite
right
my
dears
and
we
lucky
to
have
found
such
a
fine
roomy
place
for
our
establishment
before
we
go
after
the
carpenter
to
fix
it
up
i
must
telephone
to
marvin
about
the
things
we
still
need
over
the
telephone
marvin
reported
that
he
had
bought
the
required
outfit
and
it
was
even
then
being
loaded
on
the
freight
cars
i
arranged
for
a
special
engine
he
added
and
if
all
goes
well
the
freight
will
be
on
the
sidetrack
at
chazy
junction
on
monday
morning
the
dealer
will
send
down
three
men
to
set
up
the
presses
and
get
everything
in
running
order
but
he
asks
if
you
have
arranged
for
your
workmen
how
about
it
merrick
have
you
plenty
of
competent
printers
and
pressmen
at
millville
there
are
none
at
all
was
the
reply
better
inquire
how
many
we
will
need
marvin
and
send
them
down
here
and
by
the
way
hire
women
or
girls
for
every
position
they
are
competent
to
fill
this
is
going
to
be
a
girls
newspaper
so
we
have
as
few
men
around
as
possible
i
understand
sir
uncle
john
ordered
everything
he
could
think
of
and
told
his
agent
to
add
whatever
the
supply
man
thought
might
be
needed
this
business
being
accomplished
he
found
lon
taft
at
the
hotel
and
instructed
the
carpenter
to
put
rows
of
windows
on
both
sides
of
the
shed
and
to
build
partitions
for
an
editorial
office
and
a
business
office
at
the
front
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
busy
period
especially
for
poor
uncle
john
who
had
many
details
to
attend
to
personally
the
next
morning
the
electricians
arrived
and
began
stringing
the
power
cables
from
the
paper
mill
to
the
newspaper
office
this
rendered
it
necessary
for
merrick
to
make
a
trip
to
royal
to
complete
his
arrangement
with
skeelty
the
manager
he
drove
over
with
arthur
weldon
in
the
buggy
four
miles
of
hill
climbing
over
rough
into
the
pine
forest
arriving
there
the
visitors
were
astonished
at
the
extent
of
the
plant
so
recently
established
in
this
practically
unknown
district
the
great
mill
where
the
wood
pulp
was
made
was
a
building
constructed
from
pine
slabs
and
cobblestones
material
gathered
from
the
clearing
in
which
it
stood
but
it
was
quite
substantial
and
roomy
adjoining
the
mill
was
the
factory
building
where
the
pulp
was
rolled
into
print
paper
surrounding
these
huge
buildings
were
some
sixty
small
dwellings
of
the
bungalow
type
for
the
use
of
the
workmen
built
of
rough
boards
but
neat
and
uniform
in
appearance
almost
in
the
center
of
this
group
stood
the
extensive
storehouse
from
which
all
necessary
supplies
were
furnished
the
mill
hands
the
cost
being
deducted
from
their
wages
the
electric
power
plant
was
a
building
at
the
edge
of
royal
waterfall
the
low
and
persistent
roar
of
which
was
scarcely
drowned
by
the
rumble
of
machinery
finally
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
nearest
the
mills
stood
the
business
office
and
to
this
place
merrick
and
arthur
at
once
proceeded
they
found
the
office
a
busy
place
three
or
four
typewriters
were
clicking
away
operated
by
girls
and
behind
a
tall
desk
were
two
bookkeepers
in
one
of
whom
uncle
john
recognized
with
mild
surprise
the
tramp
he
had
encountered
at
chazy
junction
on
the
morning
of
his
arrival
the
young
fellow
had
improved
in
appearance
having
discarded
his
frayed
gray
suit
for
one
of
plain
brown
khaki
such
as
many
of
the
workmen
wore
a
supply
being
carried
by
the
company
store
he
was
and
trim
and
a
gentlemanly
bearing
had
replaced
the
careless
half
defiant
attitude
of
the
former
hobo
it
was
evident
he
remembered
meeting
merrick
for
he
smiled
and
returned
the
nabob
nod
skeelty
had
a
private
enclosed
office
in
a
corner
of
the
room
being
admitted
to
this
sanctum
the
visitors
found
the
manager
to
be
a
small
puffy
individual
about
years
of
age
with
shrewd
beadlike
black
eyes
and
an
insolent
assumption
of
skeelty
interrupted
his
task
of
running
up
columns
of
impressive
figures
to
ask
his
callers
to
be
seated
and
opened
the
interview
with
characteristic
abruptness
you
merrick
eh
i
remember
you
want
to
buy
power
and
we
have
it
to
sell
how
much
will
you
contract
to
take
i
do
know
just
how
much
we
need
answered
uncle
john
we
want
enough
to
run
a
newspaper
plant
at
millville
and
will
pay
for
whatever
we
use
i
ordered
a
meter
as
you
asked
me
to
do
and
my
men
are
now
stringing
the
cables
to
make
the
connection
pah
a
newspaper
how
absurd
said
skeelty
with
scornful
emphasis
your
name
merrick
is
not
unknown
to
me
it
stands
for
financial
success
i
understand
but
i
bet
you
never
made
your
money
doing
such
fool
things
as
establishing
newspapers
in
graveyards
uncle
john
looked
at
the
man
attentively
i
shall
refrain
from
criticising
your
conduct
of
this
mill
skeelty
he
quietly
observed
nor
shall
i
dictate
what
you
may
do
with
your
money
provided
you
succeed
in
making
any
the
manager
smiled
broadly
as
if
the
retort
pleased
him
give
an
take
sir
that
my
motto
he
said
but
you
prefer
to
take
i
do
was
the
cheerful
reply
i
take
your
paper
for
instance
if
it
is
too
high
priced
in
case
it
is
we
will
present
you
with
a
subscription
said
uncle
john
but
that
reminds
me
as
a
part
of
our
bargain
i
want
you
to
allow
my
nieces
or
any
representative
of
the
to
take
subscriptions
among
your
workmen
skeelty
stared
at
him
a
moment
then
he
laughed
they
mostly
foreigners
merrick
who
have
yet
fully
mastered
the
english
language
but
he
added
thoughtfully
a
few
among
them
might
subscribe
if
your
country
sheet
contains
any
news
of
interest
at
all
this
is
rather
a
lonely
place
for
my
men
and
they
get
dissatisfied
at
times
all
workmen
seem
chronically
dissatisfied
and
their
women
constantly
urge
them
to
rebellion
already
there
are
grumblings
and
they
claim
they
buried
alive
in
this
forlorn
forest
do
appreciate
the
advantages
of
country
life
you
see
and
i
an
idea
they
begin
to
desert
pretty
soon
really
a
live
newspaper
might
do
them
good
especially
if
you
print
a
little
socialistic
drivel
now
and
then
again
he
devoted
a
moment
to
thought
and
then
continued
tell
you
what
i
do
sir
i
solicit
the
subscriptions
myself
and
deduct
the
price
from
the
men
wages
as
i
do
the
cost
of
their
other
supplies
but
the
company
gets
a
commission
for
that
of
course
it
a
penny
paper
said
uncle
john
the
subscription
is
only
thirty
cents
a
month
delivered
i
suppose
so
well
i
pay
you
twenty
cents
and
keep
the
balance
for
commission
that
fair
enough
very
well
skeelty
we
after
subscriptions
more
than
money
just
now
get
all
you
can
at
that
rate
after
signing
a
contract
for
the
supply
of
electrical
power
whereby
he
was
outrageously
robbed
but
the
supply
was
guaranteed
merrick
and
arthur
returned
to
the
farm
that
man
said
louise
young
husband
referring
to
the
manager
of
the
paper
mill
is
an
unmitigated
scoundrel
sir
i
wo
deny
it
replied
merrick
it
occurs
to
me
he
is
hiring
those
poor
workmen
at
low
wages
and
making
a
profit
on
all
their
living
necessities
which
he
reserves
the
right
of
supplying
from
his
own
store
no
wonder
the
poor
fellows
get
dissatisfied
chapter
vii
the
sketch
artist
during
the
next
three
days
so
many
things
happened
at
millville
that
the
natives
were
in
a
panic
of
excitement
not
only
was
electricity
brought
from
the
paper
mill
but
a
telegraph
wire
was
run
from
chazy
junction
to
bob
west
former
storage
shed
and
a
telephone
gang
came
along
and
placed
a
private
wire
with
connections
in
the
new
newspaper
office
the
office
itself
became
transformed
as
full
winders
as
a
hothouse
exclaimed
peggy
mcnutt
with
bulging
eyes
and
neat
partitions
were
placed
for
the
offices
there
was
no
longer
any
secret
as
to
the
plans
of
the
nabobs
it
was
generally
understood
that
those
terribly
aggressive
girls
were
going
to
inflict
a
daily
paper
on
the
community
some
were
glad
and
some
rebelled
but
all
were
excited
a
perpetual
meeting
was
held
at
cotting
store
to
discuss
developments
for
something
startling
occurred
every
few
minutes
it
a
outrage
this
thing
commented
young
skim
clark
despondently
they
tryin
to
run
mother
out
o
business
an
she
a
widder
with
me
to
look
after
most
o
the
business
at
the
emporium
is
done
in
newspapers
an
magazines
an
sich
so
these
gals
thought
they
cut
under
an
take
the
business
away
from
her
ca
the
widder
clark
sell
the
new
paper
then
asked
the
blacksmith
i
dunno
had
thought
o
that
said
skim
but
the
price
is
to
be
jus
one
cent
an
we
ben
gittin
five
cents
fer
all
the
outside
papers
where
the
profit
comin
from
on
one
cent
i
like
to
know
why
we
make
two
or
three
cents
on
all
the
five
cent
papers
as
fer
that
remarked
the
druggist
we
get
a
cheap
paper
if
any
good
an
that
somethin
to
be
thankful
for
be
any
good
asserted
skim
ma
says
so
but
no
one
except
mcnutt
was
prepared
to
agree
with
this
prediction
the
extensive
plans
in
preparation
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
new
paper
would
be
fully
equal
to
the
requirements
of
the
populace
on
monday
when
the
news
spread
that
two
big
freight
cars
had
arrived
at
the
junction
and
nick
thorne
began
working
three
teams
to
haul
the
outfit
to
millville
the
rest
of
the
town
abandoned
all
business
other
than
watching
the
arrival
of
the
drays
workmen
and
machinists
arrived
from
the
city
and
began
unpacking
and
setting
up
the
presses
type
cases
and
all
other
paraphernalia
every
motion
being
watched
by
eager
faces
that
lined
the
windows
these
workmen
were
lodged
at
the
hotel
which
had
never
entertained
so
many
guests
at
one
time
in
all
its
past
history
the
three
girls
even
more
excited
and
full
of
awe
than
the
townspeople
were
at
the
office
early
and
late
taking
note
of
everything
installed
and
getting
by
degrees
a
fair
idea
of
the
extent
of
their
new
plaything
it
almost
takes
my
breath
away
uncle
said
patsy
you
given
the
such
a
splendid
start
that
we
must
hustle
to
make
good
and
prove
we
are
worthy
your
generosity
i
sat
up
last
night
and
wrote
a
poem
for
the
first
page
of
the
first
number
announced
louise
earnestly
poems
do
go
on
the
first
page
observed
patsy
but
they
needed
to
fill
in
with
what
it
about
dear
it
called
to
a
mignonette
answered
louise
it
begins
this
way
wee
brown
blossom
humble
and
sweet
content
on
my
bosom
lying
who
would
guess
from
your
quiet
dress
the
beauty
there
is
lying
under
the
rust
hm
said
patsy
i
do
see
as
there
any
beauty
under
the
rust
at
all
there
no
beauty
about
a
mignonette
anyhow
suspected
or
unsuspected
she
means
suggested
beth
change
it
to
fragrance
there
is
lying
under
the
rust
that
fix
it
all
right
louise
it
does
seem
right
even
then
remarked
uncle
john
if
the
fragrance
lies
under
the
rust
it
ca
be
smelt
can
it
i
did
not
anticipate
all
this
criticism
said
louise
with
an
air
of
injured
dignity
none
of
the
big
publishing
houses
that
returned
my
poems
ever
said
anything
mean
about
them
they
merely
said
they
were
available
however
as
this
poem
has
not
made
a
hit
with
the
managing
editor
i
tear
it
up
and
write
another
do
do
that
begged
patsy
save
it
for
emergencies
we
got
to
fill
columns
every
day
remember
by
wednesday
night
the
equipment
was
fully
installed
and
the
workmen
departed
leaving
only
jim
mcgaffey
an
experienced
pressman
and
lawrence
doane
familiarly
called
larry
who
was
to
attend
to
the
electrotyping
and
the
press
was
of
the
best
modern
construction
and
folded
cut
and
counted
the
papers
automatically
with
a
capacity
for
printing
three
thousand
copies
an
hour
and
at
that
rate
observed
patsy
it
will
run
off
our
regular
edition
in
eight
minutes
aside
from
the
newspaper
press
there
were
two
job
presses
and
an
assortment
of
type
for
printing
anything
that
might
be
required
from
a
calling
card
to
a
circus
poster
a
third
man
who
came
from
the
city
thursday
morning
was
to
take
charge
of
the
job
printing
and
assist
in
the
newspaper
work
three
girls
also
arrived
creatures
who
were
expert
typesetters
uncle
john
arranged
with
kebble
the
landlady
at
the
hotel
to
board
all
the
help
at
moderate
charge
it
had
been
decided
after
much
consultation
to
make
the
a
morning
paper
at
first
it
was
feared
this
would
result
in
keeping
the
girls
up
nights
but
it
was
finally
arranged
that
all
the
copy
they
furnished
would
be
turned
in
by
nine
and
miss
briggs
the
telegraph
editor
would
attend
to
anything
further
that
came
in
over
the
wires
the
advantages
of
a
morning
edition
were
obvious
you
have
all
day
to
distribute
a
morning
paper
arthur
pointed
out
whereas
an
evening
paper
could
get
to
your
scattered
subscribers
until
the
next
morning
miss
briggs
upon
whom
they
were
to
rely
so
greatly
proved
to
be
a
woman
of
tremendous
energy
and
undoubted
ability
she
was
years
of
age
and
had
been
engaged
in
newspaper
work
ever
since
she
was
eighteen
bright
and
cheerful
of
even
temper
and
shrewd
comprehension
miss
briggs
listened
to
the
eager
explanations
of
the
three
girls
who
had
undertaken
this
queer
venture
and
assured
them
she
would
assist
in
making
a
newspaper
that
would
be
a
credit
to
them
all
she
understood
clearly
the
conditions
that
inexperience
was
backed
by
ample
capital
and
unpractical
ideas
by
unlimited
enthusiasm
this
job
may
not
last
long
she
told
herself
but
while
it
does
it
will
be
mighty
amusing
i
shall
enjoy
these
weeks
in
a
quiet
country
town
after
the
bustle
of
the
big
city
so
here
were
seven
regular
employees
of
the
daily
already
secured
and
the
eighth
was
shortly
to
appear
preparations
were
well
under
way
for
a
first
edition
on
the
fourth
of
july
and
the
office
was
beginning
to
hum
with
work
when
one
afternoon
a
girl
strolled
in
and
asked
in
a
tired
voice
for
the
managing
editor
she
was
admitted
to
patsy
private
room
where
beth
and
louise
were
also
sitting
and
they
looked
upon
their
visitor
in
undisguised
astonishment
she
was
young
perhaps
not
over
twenty
years
of
age
her
face
bore
marks
of
considerable
dissipation
and
there
was
a
broad
scar
underneath
her
right
eye
her
hair
was
thin
straggling
and
her
eyes
large
and
of
a
faded
blue
the
girl
dress
was
as
queer
and
untidy
as
her
personal
appearance
for
she
wore
a
brown
tailored
coat
a
short
skirt
and
long
buttoned
leggings
a
round
cap
of
the
same
material
as
her
dress
was
set
jauntily
on
the
back
of
her
head
and
over
her
shoulder
was
slung
a
fiat
satchel
of
worn
leather
there
was
little
that
was
feminine
and
less
that
was
attractive
about
the
young
woman
and
patsy
eyed
her
with
distinct
disfavor
tommy
sent
me
here
said
the
newcomer
sinking
wearily
into
a
chair
i
hired
for
a
month
on
good
behavior
with
a
chance
to
stay
on
if
i
conduct
myself
in
a
ladylike
manner
i
been
working
on
the
you
know
but
there
was
no
end
of
a
row
last
week
and
they
fired
me
bodily
any
booze
for
sale
in
this
town
it
is
a
temperance
community
answered
patsy
stiffly
hooray
for
me
there
a
chance
i
keep
sober
in
that
case
acquired
the
best
sketch
artist
in
america
oh
are
you
the
artist
then
asked
patsy
with
doubtful
intonation
i
do
like
the
word
i
not
a
real
artist
just
a
cartoonist
and
newspaper
hack
say
it
funny
to
see
me
in
this
jungle
is
it
what
joy
i
have
in
astonishing
the
natives
i
a
picture
a
picture
to
them
and
art
an
impenetrable
mystery
what
sort
of
stuff
do
you
want
me
to
turn
out
i
i
not
sure
you
do
said
miss
doyle
desperately
i
we
that
is
we
are
three
quite
respectable
young
women
who
have
to
edit
the
daily
and
the
people
we
have
secured
to
assist
us
are
all
all
quite
desirable
in
their
way
so
ahem
so
that
all
right
remarked
the
artist
composedly
i
do
know
that
i
blame
you
i
can
see
very
well
the
atmosphere
is
not
my
atmosphere
when
is
the
next
train
back
to
new
york
at
four
i
believe
i
engage
a
nice
upholstered
seat
in
the
smoking
car
but
several
hours
to
loaf
and
loafing
is
my
best
stunt
is
this
a
queer
start
for
girls
like
you
looking
around
the
den
critically
i
wonder
how
you
got
the
bug
and
what
come
of
it
it
so
funny
to
see
a
newspaper
office
where
everything
is
brand
new
and
eminently
respectable
do
you
mind
my
lighting
a
cigarette
this
sort
of
a
deal
is
quite
interesting
to
an
like
me
but
perhaps
i
owe
you
an
apology
for
intruding
i
had
a
letter
from
tommy
and
one
from
a
big
banker
marvin
i
guess
his
name
is
she
drew
two
letters
from
her
satchel
and
tossed
them
on
the
desk
before
patsy
they
no
good
to
me
now
she
added
where
your
waste
basket
the
managing
editor
feeling
embarrassed
by
the
presence
of
the
artist
opened
the
letters
the
first
was
from
marvin
uncle
john
banker
saying
after
much
negotiation
i
have
secured
for
you
the
best
newspaper
illustrator
in
new
york
and
a
girl
too
which
is
an
added
satisfaction
for
months
i
have
admired
the
cartoons
signed
in
the
new
york
papers
for
they
were
essentially
clever
and
droll
miss
hewitt
is
highly
recommended
but
like
most
successful
artists
is
not
always
to
be
relied
upon
i
told
if
you
can
manage
to
win
her
confidence
she
will
be
very
loyal
to
you
the
other
letter
was
from
the
editor
of
a
great
new
york
journal
in
giving
you
hetty
he
said
i
am
parting
with
one
of
our
strongest
attractions
but
in
this
big
city
the
poor
girl
is
rapidly
drifting
to
perdition
and
i
want
to
save
her
if
possible
before
it
is
too
late
she
has
a
sweet
lovable
nature
a
generous
heart
and
a
keen
intellect
but
these
have
been
so
degraded
by
drink
and
dissipation
that
you
may
not
readily
discover
them
my
idea
is
that
in
a
country
town
away
from
all
disreputable
companionship
the
child
may
find
herself
and
come
to
her
own
again
be
patient
with
her
and
help
her
all
you
can
her
wonderful
talent
will
well
repay
you
even
if
you
are
not
interested
in
saving
one
of
god
creatures
silently
patsy
passed
the
letters
to
beth
and
louise
after
reading
them
there
was
a
new
expression
on
the
faces
they
turned
toward
hetty
hewitt
forgive
me
said
patsy
abruptly
i
i
think
i
misjudged
you
i
was
wrong
in
saying
what
i
did
no
you
were
quite
right
she
sat
with
downcast
eyes
a
moment
musing
deeply
then
she
looked
up
with
a
smile
that
quite
glorified
her
wan
face
i
like
to
stay
you
know
she
said
humbly
i
facing
a
crisis
just
now
and
on
the
whole
i
rather
straighten
up
if
you
feel
like
giving
me
a
chance
i
i
like
to
see
if
i
any
reserve
force
or
whether
the
decency
in
me
has
all
evaporated
we
try
you
and
i
sure
you
have
lots
of
reserve
force
hetty
cried
patsy
jumping
up
impulsively
to
take
the
artist
soiled
thin
hand
in
her
own
come
with
me
to
the
hotel
and
i
get
you
a
room
where
is
your
baggage
did
bring
it
i
was
sure
i
like
the
country
or
that
you
care
to
trust
me
in
new
york
they
know
me
for
what
i
worth
and
i
get
lots
of
work
and
good
advice
mixed
with
curses
we
send
for
your
trunk
said
patsy
leading
the
girl
up
the
street
no
it
in
hock
but
i
wo
need
it
with
no
booze
to
buy
i
can
invest
my
earnings
in
wearing
apparel
what
a
picturesque
place
this
is
way
back
in
the
primitive
no
hint
of
those
green
meadows
and
set
rows
of
shade
trees
that
make
most
country
towns
detestable
rocks
and
boulders
boulders
and
rocks
and
the
scraggly
pines
for
background
the
wee
brook
has
gone
crazy
what
do
you
call
it
little
bill
creek
i
going
to
stab
it
with
my
pencil
where
it
bumps
the
rocks
obstinate
and
where
it
leaps
the
little
shelves
of
slate
it
merry
and
playful
where
it
sweeps
silently
between
the
curving
banks
it
is
sulky
and
resentful
the
little
bill
has
moods
bless
its
heart
moods
betoken
character
patsy
secured
for
hetty
a
pleasant
room
facing
the
creek
where
will
you
work
at
the
office
or
here
she
asked
in
the
open
i
guess
i
run
over
the
telegraph
news
to
get
a
subject
for
the
day
cartoon
and
then
take
to
the
woods
let
me
know
what
other
pictures
you
want
and
i
do

run

arthur
weldon
in
his
capacity
as
advertising
manager
wrote
to
all
the
national
advertisers
asking
their
patronage
for
the
daily
the
letters
were
typewritten
by
the
office
stenographer
on
newly
printed
letterheads
that
fitzgerald
the
job
printer
had
prepared
some
of
the
advertisers
were
interested
enough
in
novel
proposition
to
reply
with
questions
as
to
the
circulation
of
the
new
paper
where
it
was
distributed
and
the
advertising
rates
the
voting
man
answered
frankly
that
they
had
subscribers
already
and
were
going
to
distribute
free
copies
every
day
for
a
time
as
samples
with
the
hope
of
increasing
the
subscription
list
i
am
not
sure
you
will
derive
any
benefit
at
all
from
advertising
in
our
paper
he
added
but
we
would
like
to
have
you
try
it
and
you
can
pay
us
whatever
you
consider
the
results
warrant
to
his
astonishment
the
advertisements
arrived
a
great
many
from
very
prominent
firms
who
accepted
his
proposal
with
amusement
at
his
originality
and
a
desire
to
help
the
new
venture
along
our
square
statement
of
facts
has
given
us
a
good
start
he
told
the
girls
i
really
amazed
at
our
success
and
it
up
to
you
to
make
a
paper
that
will
circulate
and
make
trade
for
these
trustful
advertisers
with
the
local
merchants
the
results
were
less
satisfying
bob
west
put
in
a
card
advertising
his
hardware
business
and
nib
corkins
cautiously
invested
a
half
dollar
to
promote
his
drug
store
and
stock
of
tarnished
cheap
jewelry
but
sam
cotting
said
everybody
knew
what
he
had
for
sale
and
advertising
would
help
him
any
arthur
drove
to
huntingdon
with
louise
and
while
the
society
editor
picked
up
items
her
husband
interviewed
the
merchants
the
huntingdon
people
were
more
interested
in
the
new
paper
than
the
millville
folk
and
arthur
quoted
such
low
prices
that
several
advertisements
were
secured
two
bright
boys
of
this
thriving
village
were
also
employed
to
ride
over
to
millville
each
morning
get
a
supply
of
and
distribute
a
sample
copy
to
every
house
in
the
neighborhood
fitz
set
up
the
ads
in
impressive
type
and
the
columns
of
the
first
edition
began
to
fill
up
days
before
the
fourth
of
july
arrived
louise
had
a
story
and
two
poems
set
in
type
and
read
over
the
proofs
dozens
of
times
with
much
pride
and
satisfaction
while
beth
prepared
an
article
on
the
history
of
baseball
and
the
probable
future
of
our
national
game
they
did
not
see
much
of
their
artist
during
the
first
days
following
her
arrival
but
one
afternoon
she
brought
patsy
a
sketch
and
asked
who
is
this
patsy
glanced
at
it
and
laughed
gleefully
it
was
peggy
mcnutt
the
of
millville
who
was
represented
sitting
on
his
front
porch
engaged
in
painting
his
wooden
foot
this
was
one
of
mcnutt
recognized
amusements
he
kept
a
supply
of
paints
of
many
colors
and
every
few
days
appeared
with
his
rudely
carved
wooden
foot
glistening
with
a
new
coat
of
paint
and
elaborately
striped
sometimes
it
would
be
blue
with
yellow
stripes
then
green
with
red
stripes
and
anon
a
lovely
pink
decorated
with
purple
one
drawback
to
delight
in
these
transformations
was
the
fact
that
it
took
the
paint
a
night
and
a
day
to
dry
thoroughly
and
during
this
period
of
waiting
he
would
sit
upon
his
porch
with
the
wooden
foot
tenderly
resting
upon
the
rail
a
helpless
prisoner
some
folks
he
would
say
likes
pretty
neckties
an
some
wears
fancy
socks
but
fer
my
part
i
ruther
show
a
foot
ner
anything
it
do
cost
as
much
as
wearin
socks
an
neckties
an
it
more
artistic
like
hetty
had
caught
the
village
character
in
the
act
of
striping
the
wooden
foot
and
his
expression
of
intense
interest
in
the
operation
was
so
original
and
the
likeness
so
perfect
from
the
string
suspenders
and
flannel
shirt
to
the
antiquated
straw
hat
and
faded
and
patched
overalls
that
no
one
would
be
likely
to
mistake
the
subject
the
sketch
was
entitled
the
village
artist
and
patsy
declared
they
would
run
it
on
an
inside
page
just
to
make
the
millville
people
aware
of
the
power
of
the
press
larry
made
an
etching
of
it
and
mounted
the
plate
for
a
double
column
picture
the
original
sketch
patsy
decided
to
have
framed
and
to
hang
it
in
her
office
chapter
viii
the
millville
daily
tribune
the
first
edition
of
the
daily
certainly
proved
it
to
be
a
wonderful
newspaper
the
telegraphic
news
of
the
world
doings
received
and
edited
by
the
skillful
miss
briggs
was
equal
to
that
of
any
metropolitan
journal
the
first
page
cartoon
referring
to
the
outbreak
of
a
rebellion
in
china
was
clever
and
humorous
enough
to
delight
anyone
but
the
local
news
and
literary
page
were
woefully
amateurish
and
smacked
of
the
schoolgirl
editors
who
had
prepared
them
perhaps
the
chazy
county
people
did
not
recognize
these
deficiencies
for
the
new
paper
certainly
created
a
vast
amount
of
excitement
and
won
the
praise
of
nearly
all
who
read
it
on
the
eventful
night
of
the
first
run
our
girls
were
too
eager
to
go
home
and
await
its
appearance
so
they
remained
at
the
office
to
see
the
birth
of
their
enterprise
and
as
it
was
the
night
preceding
the
fourth
of
july
uncle
john
gave
an
exhibition
of
fireworks
in
front
of
the
newspaper
office
to
the
delight
of
the
entire
population
the
girl
journalists
however
were
not
so
greatly
interested
in
fireworks
as
in
the
birth
of
their
fascinating
enterprise
wearing
long
gingham
aprons
they
hovered
over
the
big
table
where
the
forms
were
being
locked
up
and
watched
anxiously
every
movement
of
the
workmen
it
was
exceedingly
interesting
to
note
how
a
column
of
the
first
page
was
left
open
until
the
last
so
that
copy
hot
from
the
wire
of
the
very
latest
news
might
be
added
before
going
to
press
finally
at
exactly
two
the
forms
were
locked
placed
upon
the
bed
of
the
press
and
mcgaffey
a
individual
whose
chief
recommendation
was
his
ability
as
a
pressman
began
to
make
ready
for
the
run
outside
the
brilliantly
lighted
windows
which
were
left
open
for
air
congregated
a
wondering
group
of
the
millville
people
many
of
whom
had
never
been
up
so
late
before
in
all
their
lives
but
the
event
was
too
important
to
miss
the
huge
complicated
press
had
already
inspired
their
awe
and
they
were
eager
to
see
it
work
as
it
printed
the
new
paper
the
girls
tolerated
this
native
curiosity
with
indulgent
good
humor
and
at
midnight
even
passed
out
sandwiches
to
the
crowd
a
supply
having
been
secured
for
the
workmen
these
were
accepted
silently
and
as
they
munched
the
food
all
kept
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
magicians
within
there
was
a
hitch
somewhere
mcgaffey
muttered
naughty
words
under
his
breath
and
plied
wrenches
and
screwdrivers
in
a
way
that
brought
a
thrill
of
anxiety
approaching
fear
to
every
heart
the
press
started
half
a
dozen
times
only
to
be
shut
down
abruptly
before
it
had
printed
a
single
impression
mcgaffey
counseled
with
larry
who
shook
his
head
fitzgerald
the
job
printer
examined
the
machinery
carefully
and
again
mcgaffey
screwed
nuts
and
regulated
the
press
then
he
turned
on
the
power
the
big
cylinder
revolved
the
white
paper
reeled
out
like
a
long
ribbon
and
with
a
rattle
and
thump
the
first
copy
of
the
daily
was
deposited
cut
and
folded
upon
the
table
placed
to
receive
it
patsy
made
a
rush
for
it
but
before
she
could
reach
the
table
half
a
dozen
more
papers
had
been
piled
above
it
and
gathering
speed
the
great
press
hummed
busily
and
the
pile
of
grew
as
if
by
magic
patsy
grabbed
the
first
dozen
and
handed
them
to
beth
for
they
were
to
be
reserved
as
souvenirs
then
running
back
to
the
table
she
seized
a
bunch
and
began
distributing
them
to
the
watchers
outside
the
window
the
natives
accepted
them
eagerly
enough
but
could
not
withdraw
their
eyes
from
the
marvelous
press
which
seemed
to
possess
intelligence
almost
human
each
of
the
three
girl
journalists
now
had
a
copy
in
hand
scanning
it
with
boundless
pride
and
satisfaction
it
realized
completely
their
fondest
hopes
and
they
had
good
cause
to
rejoice
then
uncle
john
who
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
and
sound
asleep
at
this
uncanny
hour
of
night
came
bouncing
in
accompanied
by
arthur
weldon
each
made
a
dive
for
a
paper
and
each
face
wore
an
expression
of
genuine
delight
the
roar
of
the
press
made
conversation
difficult
but
merrick
caught
his
nieces
in
his
arms
by
turn
and
gave
each
one
an
ecstatic
hug
and
kiss
suddenly
the
press
stopped
what
wrong
mcgaffey
demanded
patsy
anxiously
nothing
miss
edition
off
that
all
what
the
entire
four
hundred
are
printed
four
i
run
a
few
extrys
and
now
a
shriek
of
laughter
came
from
the
windows
as
the
villagers
slowly
opening
the
papers
they
held
came
upon
the
caricature
of
peggy
mcnutt
the
subject
of
the
cartoon
had
with
his
usual
aggressiveness
secured
the
best
standing
room
available
and
his
contemplative
protruding
eyes
were
yet
fixed
upon
the
interior
of
the
workroom
but
now
his
curiosity
aroused
he
looked
at
the
paper
to
see
what
his
neighbors
were
laughing
at
and
his
expression
of
wonder
slowly
changed
to
a
broad
grin
he
straightened
up
looked
triumphantly
around
the
circle
and
exclaimed
by
gum
folks
this
paper
going
to
be
a
go
i
did
take
no
stock
in
it
till
now
but
them
fool
gals
seem
to
know
their
business
an
i
back
to
the
last
ditch
chapter
ix
trouble
of
course
the
girls
exhausted
their
store
of
effusions
on
the
first
two
or
three
papers
a
daily
eats
up
copy
very
fast
and
the
need
to
supply
so
much
material
began
to
bewilder
the
budding
journalists
there
was
not
sufficient
local
news
to
keep
them
going
but
fortunately
the
new
york
news
service
supplied
more
general
news
than
they
could
possibly
use
and
besides
marvin
foreseeing
this
dilemma
had
sent
on
several
long
stout
boxes
filled
with
plate
matter
which
meant
that
a
variety
of
stories
poems
special
articles
and
paragraphs
of
every
sort
had
been
made
into
stereotyped
plates
of
column
width
which
could
be
placed
anywhere
in
the
paper
where
a
space
needed
to
be
filled
this
material
having
been
prepared
by
skilled
writers
was
of
excellent
character
so
that
the
paper
gained
in
its
class
of
contents
as
the
girlish
contributions
began
to
be
replaced
by
plates
the
nieces
did
not
abandon
writing
however
and
all
three
worked
sedulously
to
prepare
copy
so
that
at
least
one
column
of
the
tribune
each
day
was
filled
with
notes
from
their
pens
subscriptions
came
in
freely
during
those
first
days
for
farmers
and
villagers
alike
were
proud
of
their
local
daily
and
the
price
was
so
low
that
no
one
begrudged
the
investment
but
uncle
john
well
knew
that
if
every
individual
in
the
county
subscribed
and
the
advertising
patronage
doubled
the
income
would
fall
far
short
of
running
expenses
saturday
night
when
the
pay
roll
had
to
be
met
the
girls
consulted
together
seriously
in
spite
of
the
new
subscriptions
received
a
deficiency
must
be
supplied
and
they
quietly
advanced
the
money
from
their
private
purses
this
was
no
great
hardship
for
each
had
an
ample
allowance
from
uncle
john
as
well
as
an
income
from
property
owned
in
her
own
name
it
only
about
thirty
dollars
apiece
said
patsy
i
guess
we
can
stand
that
until
until
more
money
begins
coming
in
on
saturday
evening
there
was
an
invasion
of
workmen
from
royal
many
of
whom
we
rough
foreigners
who
came
to
millville
in
search
of
excitement
as
a
relief
from
their
week
confinement
at
the
pine
woods
settlement
at
the
mill
skeelty
who
thought
he
knew
how
to
manage
these
people
allowed
every
man
at
the
close
of
work
on
saturday
to
purchase
a
pint
of
whiskey
from
the
company
store
charging
an
exorbitant
price
that
netted
a
huge
profit
there
was
no
strong
drink
to
be
had
at
millville
so
the
workmen
brought
their
bottles
to
town
carousing
on
the
way
and
thought
it
amusing
to
frighten
the
simple
inhabitants
of
the
village
by
their
rude
shouts
and
ribald
songs
this
annoyance
had
occurred
several
times
since
the
establishment
of
the
mill
and
bob
west
had
protested
vigorously
to
skeelty
for
giving
his
men
whiskey
and
turning
them
loose
in
a
respectable
community
but
the
manager
merely
grinned
and
said
he
must
keep
the
boys
satisfied
at
all
hazards
and
it
was
the
business
of
the
millville
people
to
protect
themselves
if
the
workmen
became
too
boisterous
on
this
saturday
evening
the
girls
were
standing
on
the
sidewalk
outside
the
printing
office
awaiting
the
arrival
of
arthur
with
the
surrey
when
a
group
of
the
royal
workmen
appeared
in
the
dim
light
swaggering
three
abreast
and
indulging
in
offensive
language
uncle
john
nieces
withdrew
to
the
protection
of
the
doorway
but
a
big
bearded
fellow
in
a
red
shirt
discovered
them
and
lurching
forward
pushed
his
evil
countenance
in
patsy
face
calling
to
his
fellows
in
harsh
tones
that
he
had
found
a
partner
for
a
dance
an
instant
later
he
received
a
swinging
blow
above
the
ear
that
sent
him
sprawling
at
full
length
upon
the
sidewalk
and
a
quiet
voice
said
pardon
me
ladies
it
seemed
necessary
all
three
at
once
recognized
the
supposed
tramp
whom
they
had
seen
the
morning
of
their
arrival
but
whom
uncle
john
had
reported
to
be
one
of
the
bookkeepers
at
the
paper
mill
the
young
fellow
had
no
time
to
say
more
for
the
downfall
of
their
comrade
brought
a
shout
of
rage
from
the
group
of
workmen
numbering
nearly
a
dozen
and
with
one
accord
they
rushed
upon
the
man
who
had
dared
champion
the
defenseless
girls
beth
managed
to
open
the
door
of
the
office
through
which
patsy
and
louise
slipped
instantly
but
the
younger
girl
always
cool
in
emergencies
held
the
door
ajar
while
she
cried
to
the
young
man
quick
sir
come
inside
really
he
had
no
time
to
obey
just
then
with
his
back
to
the
door
he
drove
his
fists
at
his
assailants
in
a
dogged
persistent
way
that
felled
three
more
of
them
before
the
others
drew
away
from
his
stalwart
bows
by
that
time
larry
and
fitzgerald
who
had
been
summoned
by
louise
rushed
from
the
office
armed
with
iron
bars
caught
up
at
random
both
eager
for
a
fight
the
workmen
seeing
the
reinforcements
beat
a
retreat
carrying
their
sadly
pommeled
comrades
with
them
but
their
insulting
language
was
not
restricted
until
they
had
passed
out
of
hearing
then
the
young
man
turned
bowed
gravely
to
the
girls
who
had
now
ventured
forth
again
and
without
waiting
to
receive
their
thanks
marched
calmly
down
the
street
when
arthur
reached
home
with
the
girls
merrick
was
very
indignant
at
his
report
of
the
adventure
he
denounced
skeelty
in
unmeasured
terms
and
declared
he
would
find
a
way
to
protect
millville
from
further
invasion
by
these
rough
and
drunken
workmen
there
was
no
sunday
paper
so
the
girlish
editors
found
the
morrow
a
veritable
day
of
rest
they
all
drove
to
hooker
falls
to
church
and
returned
to
find
that
old
nora
had
prepared
a
fine
chicken
dinner
for
them
patsy
had
invited
hetty
hewitt
in
whom
she
was
now
greatly
interested
to
dine
with
them
and
to
the
astonishment
of
all
the
artist
walked
over
to
the
farm
arrayed
in
a
new
gown
having
discarded
the
disreputable
costume
in
which
she
had
formerly
appeared
the
new
dress
was
not
in
the
best
of
taste
and
its
loud
checks
made
dainty
louise
shudder
but
somehow
hetty
seemed
far
more
feminine
than
before
and
she
had
moreover
washed
herself
carefully
and
tried
to
arrange
her
rebellious
hair
this
place
is
doing
me
good
she
confided
to
her
girl
employers
after
dinner
when
they
were
seated
in
a
group
upon
the
lawn
getting
over
my
nervousness
and
although
i
have
drank
a
drop
stronger
than
water
since
i
arrived
i
feel
a
new
sort
of
energy
coursing
through
my
veins
also
i
eat
like
a
trooper
not
at
night
as
i
used
to
but
at
regular
mealtime
and
i
behaving
quite
like
a
lady
do
you
know
i
would
be
surprised
to
find
it
just
as
amusing
to
be
respectable
as
to
to
be
the
other
thing
you
will
find
it
far
more
satisfactory
i
sure
replied
patsy
encouragingly
what
most
surprises
me
is
that
with
your
talent
and
education
you
ever
got
into
such
bad
ways
environment
said
hetty
that
what
did
it
when
i
first
went
to
new
york
i
was
very
young
a
newspaper
man
took
me
out
to
dinner
and
asked
me
to
have
a
cocktail
i
looked
around
the
tables
and
saw
other
girls
drinking
cocktails
so
i
took
one
that
was
where
i
turned
into
the
rocky
road
people
get
careless
around
the
newspaper
offices
they
work
under
a
constant
nervous
strain
and
find
that
drink
steadies
them
for
a
time
by
and
by
they
disappear
others
take
their
places
and
they
are
never
heard
of
again
except
in
the
police
courts
i
knew
a
girl
society
editor
of
a
big
paper
who
drew
her
five
thousand
a
year
at
one
time
she
got
the
cocktail
habit
and
a
week
or
so
ago
i
paid
her
fine
for
getting
pinched
while
intoxicated
she
was
in
rags
and
had
a
red
cent
that
set
me
thinking
and
when
tommy
fired
me
from
his
paper
and
said
the
best
he
could
do
was
to
get
me
a
job
in
the
country
it
seemed
as
if
my
chance
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
had
arrived
i
turned
it
she
added
with
a
pathetic
sigh
but
whether
it
stay
turned
or
not
is
a
question
for
the
puzzle
page
have
you
a
family
to
look
after
you
or
for
you
to
look
after
asked
beth
no
brother
and
i
were
left
orphans
in
a
connecticut
town
and
he
went
out
west
to
chicago
and
promised
to
send
for
me
must
have
forgot
that
promise
i
guess
for
i
never
heard
of
dan
since
i
could
draw
pictures
so
i
went
to
new
york
and
found
a
job
guess
that
my
biography
and
it
is
as
interesting
as
one
of
hearst
editorials
either
hetty
seemed
pleased
and
grateful
to
note
the
frank
friendliness
of
her
girlish
employers
in
whom
she
recognized
the
admirable
qualities
she
had
personally
sacrificed
for
a
life
of
dissipation
in
the
privacy
of
her
room
at
the
hotel
she
had
read
the
first
copy
of
the
millville
tribune
and
shrieked
with
laughter
at
the
ingenuous
editorials
and
schoolgirl
essays
then
she
grew
sober
and
thoughtful
envying
in
her
heart
the
sweetness
and
simplicity
so
apparent
in
every
line
here
were
girls
who
possessed
something
infinitely
higher
than
journalistic
acumen
they
were
true
women
with
genuine
womanly
qualities
and
natures
that
betrayed
their
worth
at
a
glance
as
do
ingots
of
refined
gold
what
would
not
this
waif
from
the
grim
underworld
of
new
york
have
given
for
such
clear
eyes
pure
mind
and
unsullied
heart
i
do
know
as
i
can
ever
swim
in
their
pond
hetty
reflected
with
honest
regret
but
there
a
chance
i
can
look
folks
square
in
the
eye
again
and
that
would
be
so
bad
monday
morning
when
patsy
louise
and
beth
drove
to
their
office
miss
briggs
said
nonchalantly
mcgaffey
gone
gone
gone
where
asked
patsy
back
to
new
york
caught
a
freight
from
the
junction
saturday
night
is
he
coming
back
inquired
beth
here
a
letter
he
left
said
miss
briggs
they
read
it
together
it
was
very
brief
climate
do
suit
me
no
excitement
i
quit
mcgaffey
i
suppose
said
patsy
with
indignation
he
intended
to
go
all
the
while
and
only
waited
for
his
saturday
pay
miss
briggs
nodded
she
was
at
the
telegraph
instrument
what
shall
we
do
asked
louise
can
anyone
else
work
the
press
i
find
out
said
patsy
marching
into
the
workroom
neither
fitz
nor
larry
would
undertake
to
run
the
press
they
said
the
machine
was
so
complicated
it
required
an
expert
and
unless
an
experienced
pressman
could
be
secured
the
paper
must
suspend
publication
here
was
an
unexpected
dilemma
one
that
for
a
time
dazed
them
these
things
always
happen
in
the
newspaper
business
remarked
miss
briggs
when
appealed
to
ca
you
telegraph
to
new
york
for
another
pressman
yes
but
he
ca
get
here
in
time
said
patsy
there
no
monday
train
to
chazy
junction
at
all
and
it
would
be
wednesday
morning
before
a
man
could
possibly
arrive
to
shut
down
the
paper
would
ruin
it
for
everyone
would
think
we
had
failed
in
our
attempt
and
it
might
take
us
weeks
to
regain
public
confidence
i
know
said
miss
briggs
composedly
a
paper
never
stops
somehow
or
other
it
always
keeps
going
even
if
the
world
turns
somersaults
and
stands
on
its
head
you
find
a
way
i
sure
but
the
bewildered
girls
had
no
such
confidence
they
drove
back
to
the
farm
to
consult
with
uncle
john
and
arthur
let
take
a
look
at
that
press
my
dears
said
merrick
something
of
a
mechanic
myself
or
was
in
my
young
days
and
i
may
be
able
to
work
this
thing
until
we
can
get
a
new
pressman
i
help
you
said
arthur
anyone
who
can
run
an
automobile
ought
to
be
able
to
manage
a
printing
press
so
they
went
to
the
office
took
off
their
coats
and
examined
the
press
but
the
big
machine
defied
their
combined
intelligence
uncle
john
turned
on
the
power
the
cylinder
groaned
swung
half
around
and
then
the
huge
wooden
nippers
came
down
upon
the
table
with
a
force
that
shattered
them
to
kindlings
at
the
crash
merrick
involuntarily
shut
down
the
machine
and
then
they
all
stood
around
and
looked
gloomily
at
the
and
wondered
if
the
damage
was
irreparable
could
we
print
the
paper
on
the
job
press
asked
the
little
millionaire
turning
to
fitzgerald
in
sections
sir
replied
fitz
grinning
half
a
page
at
a
time
is
all
we
can
manage
but
we
might
be
able
to
match
margins
so
the
thing
could
be
read
we
try
it
said
uncle
john
do
your
best
my
man
and
if
you
can
help
us
out
of
this
bog
you
shall
be
amply
rewarded
fitz
looked
grave
never
knew
of
such
a
thing
being
done
sir
he
remarked
but
no
reason
it
impossible
be
a
horror
of
a
added
larry
who
did
not
relish
his
part
in
the
experiment
uncle
john
put
on
his
coat
and
went
into
the
front
office
followed
by
arthur
and
the
girls
in
dismal
procession
a
man
to
see
the
manager
announced
miss
briggs
nodding
toward
a
quiet
figure
seated
on
the
waiting
bench
the
man
stood
up
and
bowed
it
was
the
young
bookkeeper
from
the
paper
mill
who
had
so
bravely
defended
the
girls
on
saturday
night
uncle
john
regarded
him
with
a
frown
i
suppose
skeelty
has
sent
you
to
apologize
he
said
no
sir
skeelty
is
not
in
an
apologetic
mood
replied
the
man
smiling
he
has
fired
me
what
for
interfering
with
his
workmen
the
boys
did
like
what
i
did
the
other
night
and
threatened
to
strike
unless
i
was
put
in
the
discard
and
now
asked
uncle
john
looking
curiously
at
the
man
i
out
of
work
and
would
like
a
job
sir
what
can
you
do
anything
that
means
nothing
at
all
i
beg
your
pardon
let
me
say
that
i
not
afraid
to
tackle
anything
can
you
run
a
power
printing
press
yes
sir
ever
had
any
experience
the
young
man
hesitated
i
not
sure
he
replied
slowly
but
i
think
i
have
this
statement
would
not
have
been
encouraging
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
in
this
emergency
uncle
john
accepted
it
what
is
your
name
he
asked
another
moment
hesitation
call
me
smith
please
first
name
the
man
smiled
thursday
he
said
all
his
hearers
seemed
astonished
at
this
peculiar
name
but
merrick
said
abruptly
follow
me
thursday
smith
the
man
obeyed
and
the
girls
and
arthur
trotted
after
them
back
to
the
pressroom
our
pressman
has
deserted
us
without
warning
explained
merrick
none
of
our
other
employees
is
able
to
run
the
thing
if
you
can
master
it
so
as
to
run
off
the
paper
tonight
the
job
is
yours
thursday
smith
took
off
his
jacket
a
cheap
khaki
affair
and
rolled
up
his
sleeves
then
he
carefully
looked
over
the
press
and
found
the
damaged
nippers
without
a
word
he
picked
up
a
wrench
released
the
stub
ends
of
the
broken
fingers
gathered
the
pieces
in
his
hand
and
asked
where
is
there
a
carpenter
shop
can
you
operate
this
press
asked
merrick
yes
sir
the
carpenter
shop
is
a
little
shanty
back
of
the
hotel
you
find
lon
taft
there
smith
walked
away
and
merrick
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
that
good
luck
he
said
you
may
quit
worrying
now
my
dears
are
you
sure
he
a
good
pressman
uncle
no
but
is
sure
i
an
idea
he
would
attempt
the
thing
otherwise
merrick
returned
to
the
farm
while
arthur
drove
louise
over
to
huntingdon
to
gather
items
for
the
paper
and
patsy
and
beth
sat
in
the
office
arranging
copy
in
an
hour
smith
came
back
with
new
nippers
which
he
fitted
to
the
steel
frame
then
he
oiled
the
press
started
it
going
a
few
revolutions
to
test
its
condition
and
handled
the
machinery
so
dexterously
and
with
such
evident
confidence
that
larry
nodded
to
fitz
and
muttered
he
do
mcgaffey
knowing
he
was
about
to
decamp
had
not
kept
the
press
very
clean
but
thursday
smith
put
in
the
afternoon
and
evening
removing
grease
polishing
and
rubbing
until
the
huge
machine
shone
resplendent
the
girls
went
home
at
dinner
time
but
they
sent
arthur
to
the
office
at
midnight
to
see
if
the
new
pressman
was
proving
capable
the
tuesday
morning
greeted
them
at
the
breakfast
table
and
the
presswork
was
remarkably
clean
and
distinct
chapter
x
thursday
smith
in
a
day
or
so
merrick
received
a
letter
from
skeelty
the
manager
of
the
paper
mill
he
said
i
understand
you
have
employed
one
of
my
discharged
workmen
who
is
named
thursday
smith
my
men
do
want
him
in
this
neighborhood
and
have
made
a
strong
protest
i
therefore
desire
you
to
discharge
the
fellow
at
once
and
in
case
you
refuse
to
accede
to
this
reasonable
demand
i
shall
shut
off
your
power
merrick
replied
shut
off
the
power
and
i
sue
you
for
damages
my
contract
with
you
fully
protects
me
permit
me
a
request
in
turn
that
you
mind
your
own
business
the
will
employ
whomsoever
it
chooses
uncle
john
said
nothing
to
the
girls
concerning
this
correspondence
nor
did
he
mention
it
to
the
new
pressman
on
wednesday
larry
and
fitz
sent
in
their
resignations
to
take
effect
saturday
night
they
told
patsy
who
promptly
interviewed
them
that
the
town
was
altogether
too
slow
for
men
accustomed
to
the
city
but
to
smith
they
admitted
they
feared
trouble
from
the
men
at
the
mill
i
talked
with
one
of
the
mill
hands
last
night
said
larry
and
they
up
to
mischief
if
you
stay
here
my
boy
you
better
watch
out
for
it
you
they
after
in
the
first
place
and
skeelty
has
told
he
would
be
annoyed
if
they
wiped
out
the
whole
newspaper
plant
at
the
same
time
thursday
nodded
but
said
nothing
he
began
watching
the
work
of
the
two
men
with
comprehensive
care
when
merrick
came
down
to
the
office
during
the
forenoon
to
consult
with
his
nieces
about
replacing
the
two
men
who
had
resigned
smith
asked
him
for
a
private
interview
come
into
the
office
said
uncle
john
when
the
man
found
the
three
girl
journalists
present
he
hesitated
but
merrick
declared
they
were
the
ones
most
interested
in
anything
an
employee
of
the
paper
might
have
to
say
to
his
principals
i
am
told
sir
thursday
began
that
the
people
at
the
mill
have
boycotted
this
paper
they
cancelled
all
their
subscriptions
replied
beth
but
as
they
had
not
paid
for
them
it
wo
hurt
us
any
it
seems
the
trouble
started
through
your
employing
me
resumed
the
young
man
so
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
let
me
go
never
cried
merrick
firmly
do
you
suppose
i
allow
that
rascal
skeelty
to
dictate
to
us
for
a
single
minute
not
by
a
jug
full
and
the
reason
the
men
dislike
you
is
because
you
pounded
some
of
them
unmercifully
when
they
annoyed
my
girls
where
did
you
learn
to
use
your
fists
so
cleverly
smith
i
do
know
sir
well
you
have
earned
our
gratitude
and
we
going
to
stand
by
you
i
do
mind
a
bit
of
a
row
when
i
on
the
right
side
of
an
argument
do
you
not
at
all
sir
but
the
young
ladies
they
pretty
good
fighters
too
so
do
worry
thursday
was
silent
a
moment
then
he
said
fitzgerald
and
doane
tell
me
they
going
to
quit
saturday
it
is
true
replied
patsy
i
sorry
for
they
seem
good
men
and
we
may
have
trouble
replacing
them
they
are
not
needed
here
miss
doyle
said
smith
there
is
a
great
deal
of
electrotyping
to
do
or
much
job
printing
more
than
half
the
time
the
two
men
are
idle
it
the
same
way
with
my
own
job
three
hours
a
day
will
take
care
of
the
press
and
make
the
regular
run
if
you
will
permit
me
i
am
sure
i
can
attend
to
all
the
work
unaided
they
looked
at
one
another
in
amazement
how
about
the
asked
uncle
john
i
can
manage
that
easily
sir
i
been
watching
the
operation
and
understand
it
perfectly
and
you
believe
you
can
do
the
work
of
three
men
three
men
were
unnecessary
in
a
small
plant
like
this
sir
whoever
sent
them
to
you
did
not
understand
very
well
your
requirements
been
watching
the
compositors
too
and
your
three
girls
are
one
too
many
two
are
sisters
and
can
set
all
the
type
very
easily
i
recommend
that
you
send
the
other
back
to
new
york
they
considered
this
advice
seriously
i
think
smith
is
right
observed
patsy
the
girls
have
not
seemed
busy
at
all
and
spend
most
of
their
time
laughing
and
talking
together
it
will
cut
down
expenses
a
lot
said
beth
and
i
sure
we
ought
to
be
able
to
run
this
paper
more
economically
than
we
have
been
doing
uncle
john
looked
at
the
man
thoughtfully
where
did
you
learn
the
printing
business
he
asked
i
i
do
know
sir
what
offices
have
you
worked
in
i
can
not
tell
you
that
sir
you
seem
to
answer
all
my
questions
with
the
statement
that
you
know
asserted
merrick
with
an
annoyed
frown
is
there
any
reason
you
should
refuse
to
tell
us
of
your
former
life
none
whatever
sir
who
are
you
smith
i
i
do
know
sir
merrick
was
getting
provoked
this
obstinacy
is
not
likely
to
win
our
confidence
he
said
under
the
circumstances
i
think
we
ought
to
know
something
more
about
you
before
we
allow
you
to
undertake
so
much
responsibility
you
seem
a
bright
able
young
man
and
i
no
doubt
you
understand
the
work
about
to
undertake
but
if
we
have
no
knowledge
of
your
antecedents
you
may
cause
us
considerable
future
trouble
smith
bowed
his
head
and
his
cheeks
flamed
red
i
have
no
knowledge
of
my
antecedents
to
confide
to
you
sir
he
said
in
a
low
voice
uncle
john
sighed
regretfully
and
turned
away
but
patsy
looked
at
the
man
with
new
interest
wo
you
please
explain
that
a
little
more
fully
she
gently
inquired
i
am
quite
willing
to
tell
all
i
know
said
he
but
that
is
very
little
i
assure
you
two
years
ago
last
may
on
the
morning
of
thursday
the
i
awoke
to
find
myself
lying
in
a
ditch
beside
a
road
of
my
life
previous
to
that
time
i
have
no
knowledge
whatever
the
three
girls
regarded
him
with
startled
eyes
uncle
john
turned
from
the
window
to
examine
the
young
man
with
new
interest
were
you
injured
he
asked
my
right
ankle
was
sprained
and
i
had
a
cut
under
my
left
eye
you
can
see
the
scar
still
you
have
no
idea
how
you
came
there
not
the
slightest
i
did
not
recognize
the
surrounding
country
i
had
no
clear
impression
as
to
who
i
was
there
was
a
farmhouse
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
i
limped
to
it
and
they
gave
me
some
breakfast
i
found
i
was
miles
from
new
york
the
farmer
had
heard
of
no
accident
there
was
no
railway
nearer
than
six
miles
the
highway
was
little
used
i
told
the
good
people
my
story
and
they
suspected
me
of
being
drunk
or
crazy
but
did
not
credit
a
single
word
i
said
that
was
but
natural
said
uncle
john
after
breakfast
i
took
stock
of
myself
in
my
pockets
i
found
a
bill
and
some
silver
i
wore
a
watch
and
chain
and
a
ring
set
with
a
diamond
my
clothing
seemed
good
but
the
ditch
had
soiled
it
i
had
no
hat
nor
could
the
farmer
find
one
when
i
sent
him
back
to
look
for
it
my
mind
was
not
wholly
a
blank
i
seemed
to
have
a
fair
knowledge
of
life
and
when
the
farmer
mentioned
new
york
the
city
seemed
familiar
to
me
but
in
regard
to
myself
my
past
history
even
my
name
i
was
totally
ignorant
all
personal
consciousness
dated
from
the
moment
i
woke
up
in
the
ditch
how
wonderful
exclaimed
louise
and
you
have
solved
the
mystery
yet
after
two
years
asked
patsy
no
miss
doyle
i
hired
the
farmer
to
drive
me
to
the
railway
station
where
i
took
the
train
to
new
york
i
seemed
to
know
the
city
but
no
recollection
guided
me
to
home
or
friends
i
went
to
a
small
hotel
took
a
room
and
began
to
read
all
the
newspapers
seeking
to
discover
if
anyone
was
reported
missing
the
sight
of
automobiles
led
me
to
conceive
the
theory
that
i
had
been
riding
in
one
of
those
machines
along
a
country
road
when
something
threw
me
out
my
head
might
have
struck
a
stump
or
stone
and
the
blow
rendered
me
insensible
something
in
the
nature
of
the
thing
or
in
my
physical
condition
deprived
me
of
all
knowledge
of
the
past
since
then
i
have
read
of
several
similar
cases
the
curious
thing
about
my
own
experience
was
that
i
could
find
no
reference
to
my
disappearance
in
any
way
nor
could
i
learn
of
any
automobile
accident
that
might
account
for
it
i
walked
the
streets
day
after
day
hoping
some
acquaintance
would
accost
me
i
waited
patiently
for
some
impulse
to
direct
me
to
my
former
haunts
i
searched
the
newspapers
persistently
for
a
clue
but
nothing
rewarded
me
after
spending
all
my
money
and
the
proceeds
of
my
watch
and
diamond
i
began
to
seek
employment
but
no
one
would
employ
a
man
without
recommendations
or
antecedents
i
did
not
know
what
work
i
was
capable
of
doing
so
finally
i
left
the
city
and
for
more
than
two
years
i
have
been
wandering
from
one
part
of
the
country
to
another
hoping
that
some
day
i
would
recognize
a
familiar
spot
i
have
done
odd
jobs
at
times
but
my
fortunes
went
from
bad
to
worse
until
of
late
i
have
become
no
better
than
the
typical
tramp
how
did
you
secure
employment
as
a
for
skeelty
asked
uncle
john
i
heard
a
new
mill
had
started
at
royal
and
walked
up
there
to
inquire
for
work
the
manager
asked
if
i
could
keep
books
and
i
said
yes
have
you
ever
kept
books
before
not
that
i
know
of
but
i
did
it
very
well
i
seemed
to
comprehend
the
work
at
once
and
needed
no
instruction
often
during
these
two
years
i
have
encountered
similar
curious
conditions
i
sold
goods
in
a
store
and
seemed
to
know
the
stocks
i
worked
two
weeks
in
a
telegraph
office
and
discovered
i
knew
the
code
perfectly
i
shod
horses
for
a
country
blacksmith
wired
a
house
for
electric
lights
and
compounded
prescriptions
in
a
drug
store
whatever
i
have
undertaken
to
do
i
seem
able
to
accomplish
and
so
it
is
hard
for
me
to
guess
what
profession
i
followed
before
my
memory
deserted
me
you
did
not
retain
any
position
for
long
it
seems
remarked
uncle
john
no
i
was
always
impatient
to
move
on
always
hoping
to
arrive
at
some
place
so
familiar
that
my
lost
memory
would
return
to
me
the
work
i
have
mentioned
was
nearly
all
secured
during
the
first
year
after
i
became
seedy
and
disreputable
in
appearance
people
were
more
apt
to
suspect
me
and
work
was
harder
to
obtain
why
did
you
come
to
millville
asked
louise
you
brought
me
here
he
answered
with
a
smile
i
caught
a
ride
on
your
private
car
when
it
left
new
york
not
caring
much
where
it
might
take
me
when
i
woke
up
the
next
morning
the
car
was
sidetracked
at
chazy
junction
and
as
this
is
a
section
i
have
never
before
explored
i
decided
to
stay
here
for
a
time
that
is
all
of
my
story
i
believe
quite
remarkable
declared
merrick
emphatically
the
girls
too
had
been
intensely
interested
in
the
strange
recital
you
seem
educated
said
patsy
thoughtfully
therefore
you
must
have
come
from
a
good
family
that
does
not
seem
conclusive
replied
thursday
smith
deprecatingly
although
i
naturally
hope
my
family
was
respectable
i
have
been
inclined
to
resent
the
fact
that
none
of
my
friends
or
relatives
has
ever
inquired
what
became
of
me
are
you
sure
they
have
not
i
have
watched
the
papers
carefully
in
two
years
i
have
followed
several
clues
a
bricklayer
disappeared
but
his
drowned
body
was
finally
found
a
college
professor
was
missing
but
he
was
sixty
years
of
age
a
young
man
in
new
york
embezzled
a
large
sum
and
hid
himself
i
followed
that
trail
although
regretfully
but
the
real
embezzler
was
caught
the
day
i
presented
myself
in
his
place
perhaps
the
most
curious
experience
was
in
the
case
of
a
young
husband
who
deserted
his
wife
and
infant
child
she
advertised
for
him
he
had
disappeared
about
the
time
i
had
found
myself
so
i
went
to
see
her
what
was
the
result
asked
beth
she
said
i
was
not
her
husband
but
if
he
failed
to
come
back
i
might
take
his
place
provided
i
would
guarantee
to
support
her
during
the
laugh
that
followed
thursday
smith
went
back
to
his
work
and
an
animated
discussion
concerning
his
strange
story
followed
he
seems
honest
said
louise
but
i
blame
a
man
of
his
ability
for
becoming
a
mere
tramp
he
ought
to
have
asserted
himself
and
maintained
the
position
in
which
he
first
found
himself
how
inquired
patsy
at
that
time
he
was
well
dressed
and
had
a
watch
and
diamond
ring
if
he
had
gone
to
some
one
and
frankly
told
his
story
he
could
surely
have
obtained
a
position
to
correspond
with
his
personality
but
instead
of
this
he
wasted
his
time
and
the
little
capital
he
possessed
in
doing
nothing
that
was
sensible
it
is
easy
for
us
to
criticise
the
man
remarked
beth
and
he
may
be
sorry
now
that
he
did
not
act
differently
but
i
think
in
his
place
i
should
have
made
the
same
attempt
he
did
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
his
lost
identity
so
much
depended
upon
that
it
all
very
odd
and
incomprehensible
said
uncle
john
i
wonder
who
he
can
be
i
suppose
he
calls
himself
thursday
because
that
was
the
day
he
first
found
himself
observed
patsy
yes
and
smith
was
the
commonest
name
he
could
think
of
to
go
with
it
the
most
surprising
thing
added
their
uncle
is
the
fact
that
a
man
of
his
standing
was
not
missed
or
sought
for
perhaps
suggested
louise
he
had
been
insane
and
escaped
from
some
asylum
then
how
did
he
come
to
be
lying
in
a
ditch
questioned
patsy
and
would
an
escaped
maniac
be
promptly
hunted
down
and
captured
i
think
so
agreed
merrick
for
my
part
i
inclined
to
accept
the
man
theory
that
it
was
an
automobile
accident
then
what
became
of
the
car
or
of
the
others
in
it
it
no
use
said
beth
shaking
her
head
gravely
if
thursday
smith
who
is
an
intelligent
young
man
could
solve
the
mystery
himself
it
is
likely
we
can
do
so
we
know
as
much
as
he
does
as
far
as
that
is
concerned
said
patsy
and
our
combined
intelligence
ought
at
least
to
equal
his
i
sorry
for
the
poor
man
and
wish
we
might
help
him
to
come
to
his
own
again
they
all
agreed
to
this
sentiment
and
while
the
girls
attended
to
their
editorial
duties
they
had
the
amazing
story
of
thursday
smith
uppermost
in
their
minds
when
the
last
copy
had
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
miss
briggs
and
they
were
driving
to
the
farm
at
a
little
after
six
they
renewed
the
interesting
discussion
just
before
reaching
the
farm
hetty
hewitt
came
out
of
the
wood
just
in
front
of
them
she
was
clothed
in
her
short
skirt
and
leggings
and
bore
a
fishing
rod
and
a
creel
what
luck
asked
patsy
stopping
the
horse
seven
trout
answered
the
artist
i
might
have
caught
more
but
the
poor
little
creatures
squirmed
and
struggled
so
desperately
that
i
had
the
heart
to
destroy
any
more
of
them
wo
you
take
them
home
for
merrick
breakfast
patsy
looked
at
the
girl
musingly
jump
in
hetty
she
said
i
going
to
take
you
with
us
for
the
night
the
day
fishing
has
tired
you
there
are
deep
circles
under
your
eyes
and
that
stuffy
old
hotel
is
jump
in
hetty
flushed
with
pleasure
but
hesitated
to
accept
the
invitation
i
i
not
dressed
for
you
all
right
said
beth
supporting
her
cousin
proposition
we
lend
you
anything
you
need
do
come
miss
hewitt
added
louise
hetty
sighed
then
smiled
and
finally
climbed
into
the
surrey
in
new
york
she
said
as
they
started
on
i
sometimes
hobnobbed
with
editors
but
this
is
somewhat
different
in
what
way
asked
patsy
casually
you
not
real
journalists
you
know
and
why
are
we
journalists
asked
louise
for
a
moment
hetty
was
puzzled
how
to
reply
you
are
doing
very
good
editorial
work
she
said
mendaciously
but
after
all
you
are
only
playing
at
journalism
the
real
journalist
as
i
know
him
is
a
bohemian
a
font
of
cleverness
running
to
waste
a
reckless
jolly
careless
who
works
like
a
trojan
and
plays
like
a
child
he
is
very
sophisticated
at
his
desk
and
very
artless
when
he
dives
into
the
underworld
for
rest
and
recreation
he
lives
at
high
tension
scintillates
burns
his
red
fire
without
discrimination
and
is
shortly
extinguished
you
are
not
like
that
you
ca
even
sympathize
with
that
sort
of
person
but
i
can
for
i
cut
from
a
remnant
of
the
same
cloth
scintillate
all
you
want
to
hetty
cried
patsy
with
a
laugh
but
you
not
going
to
be
extinguished
for
we
the
imitation
journalists
have
taken
you
under
our
wings
there
no
underworld
at
millville
and
the
only
excitement
we
can
furnish
just
now
is
a
night
with
us
at
the
old
farm
that
replied
hetty
is
indeed
a
real
excitement
you
ca
quite
understand
it
perhaps
but
it
so
so
very
different
from
what
accustomed
to
uncle
john
welcomed
the
girl
artist
cordially
and
under
his
hospitable
roof
the
waif
soon
felt
at
ease
at
dinner
the
conversation
turned
upon
thursday
smith
and
his
peculiar
experience
beth
asked
hetty
if
she
knew
the
man
yes
replied
the
girl
i
seen
him
at
the
office
and
exchanged
a
word
or
two
but
he
boards
with
thorne
the
liveryman
and
not
at
the
hotel
you
have
never
seen
him
before
you
met
him
here
never
i
wonder
said
louise
musingly
if
he
is
quite
right
in
his
mind
all
this
story
may
be
an
hallucination
you
know
he
a
very
clever
fellow
asserted
hetty
and
such
a
loss
of
memory
is
by
no
means
so
uncommon
as
you
think
our
brains
are
queer
things
mine
is
i
know
and
it
does
take
much
to
throw
their
machinery
out
of
gear
once
i
knew
a
reporter
who
was
worried
and
he
came
to
the
office
one
morning
and
said
he
was
george
washington
the
commander
of
the
continental
army
in
all
other
ways
he
was
sane
enough
and
we
humored
him
and
called
him
at
the
end
of
three
months
the
idea
quit
him
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
on
and
he
was
not
only
normal
but
greatly
restored
in
strength
of
intellect
through
the
experience
perhaps
some
of
the
overworked
brain
cells
had
taken
a
rest
and
renewed
their
energy
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
some
day
thursday
smith
suddenly
remembered
who
he
was
footnote
this
anecdote
is
in
the
meantime
said
uncle
john
i
going
to
make
an
effort
to
discover
his
identity
in
what
way
uncle
asked
patsy
i
set
fogerty
who
is
a
clever
detective
at
work
no
man
can
disappear
from
his
customary
haunts
without
leaving
some
sort
of
a
record
behind
him
and
fogerty
may
be
able
to
uncover
the
mystery
in
a
short
time
then
we
lose
our
pressman
declared
beth
for
i
positive
that
thursday
smith
was
a
person
of
some
importance
in
his
past
life
chapter
xi
the
ojoy
boglin
one
morning
while
patsy
was
alone
in
her
office
busied
over
her
work
the
door
softly
opened
and
a
curious
looking
individual
stood
before
her
he
was
thin
in
form
leathery
skinned
and
somewhat
past
the
middle
age
of
life
his
clothing
consisted
of
a
rusty
black
prince
albert
coat
rusty
trousers
to
match
which
were
carefully
creased
cowhide
shoes
brilliant
with
stove
polish
a
tall
silk
hat
of
antiquated
design
and
a
frayed
winged
collar
decorated
with
a
black
tie
on
which
sparkled
a
large
diamond
attached
to
a
chain
he
had
chin
whiskers
of
a
sandy
gray
color
and
small
gray
eyes
that
were
both
shrewd
and
suspicious
in
expression
he
stood
in
the
doorway
a
moment
attentively
eyeing
the
girl
while
she
in
turn
examined
him
with
an
amusement
she
could
not
quite
suppress
then
he
said
speaking
in
a
low
diffident
voice
i
lookin
for
the
editor
i
am
the
editor
asserted
patsy
really
it
is
quite
true
he
seemed
disconcerted
a
moment
striving
to
regain
his
assurance
then
he
took
out
a
pocketbook
and
from
its
depths
abstracted
a
soiled
card
which
leaning
forward
he
placed
carefully
upon
the
table
before
patsy
she
glanced
at
it
and
read
hon
ojoy
boglin
falls
chazy
county
oh
said
she
rather
surprised
are
you
mr
boglin
i
am
the
ojoy
boglin
miss
he
replied
dwelling
lovingly
upon
the
i
have
not
had
the
honor
of
your
acquaintance
said
she
deciding
she
did
not
like
her
visitor
what
is
your
business
please
the
hon
ojoy
coughed
then
he
suddenly
remembered
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
and
took
off
his
hat
next
he
slid
slowly
into
the
vacant
chair
at
the
end
of
the
table
first
he
began
i
want
to
compliment
you
on
your
new
paper
it
a
good
thing
and
i
like
it
it
what
been
needed
in
these
parts
a
long
time
and
it
talked
about
all
over
chazy
county
thank
you
said
the
editor
briefly
for
the
praise
was
given
in
a
perfunctory
way
that
irritated
her
the
only
other
papers
in
this
senatorial
deestric
which
covers
three
counties
continued
the
visitor
in
impressive
tones
air
weeklies
run
by
political
that
bought
up
by
the
kleppish
gang
what
is
the
kleppish
gang
she
asked
wonderingly
the
supporters
o
that
rascal
colonel
kleppish
who
has
been
occupyin
my
berth
for
goin
on
eight
years
he
said
with
fierce
indignation
i
fear
i
do
not
understand
remarked
patsy
really
bewildered
what
was
your
berth
which
colonel
kleppish
has
has
usurped
see
that
on
the
card
i
do
that
means
i
were
senator
state
senator
which
makes
any
common
man
accordin
to
law
which
it
useless
to
dispute
i
were
elected
fer
this
deestric
which
covers
three
counties
he
said
proudly
an
i
served
my
country
in
that
capacity
oh
i
see
but
you
not
state
senator
now
no
kleppish
beat
me
for
the
nomination
after
i
served
only
one
term
why
eh
why
did
he
git
the
nomination
he
bought
up
the
newspapers
the
country
weeklies
and
set
them
to
yellin
he
made
say
i
went
into
office
poor
and
in
two
years
made
a
fortune
did
you
asked
the
girl
he
shuffled
in
his
seat
i
ai
used
to
talkin
politics
with
a
girl
he
admitted
but
as
you
the
editor
of
this
paper
a
daily
by
jupe
you
probably
got
a
head
on
you
and
understand
that
a
man
do
get
into
office
for
his
health
there
a
lot
of
bother
in
servin
your
country
and
a
man
oughter
be
well
paid
for
it
i
did
jest
like
the
others
do
like
kleppish
is
doin
right
now
but
the
voters
do
understand
politics
and
when
the
howl
went
up
about
graft
backed
by
newspapers
they
turned
me
down
cold
i
been
eight
years
watchin
for
a
chance
to
get
in
again
an
now
i
got
it
this
is
very
interesting
i
sure
remarked
patsy
but
our
paper
does
go
much
into
local
politics
boglin
and
i
very
busy
ojoy
boglin
he
said
correcting
her
but
he
did
not
take
the
hint
to
leave
patsy
picked
up
her
pencil
as
if
to
resume
her
work
while
he
eyed
her
with
a
countenance
baffled
and
uncertain
presently
he
asked
has
kleppish
got
this
paper
too
no
she
coldly
replied
i
thought
i
likely
head
him
off
you
being
so
new
see
here
editor
i
am
miss
doyle
sir
glad
to
know
you
miss
doyle
what
i
was
about
to
remark
is
this
the
election
for
senator
comes
up
agin
in
september
and
i
want
this
paper
to
pull
for
me
bein
as
it
a
daily
it
got
more
power
than
all
of
kleppish
weeklies
put
together
and
if
you
work
the
campaign
proper
i
win
the
nomination
hands
down
this
is
a
strong
republican
deestric
and
to
git
nominated
on
the
republican
ticket
is
the
same
as
an
election
so
what
i
want
is
the
nomination
what
do
you
say
patsy
glared
at
him
and
decided
that
as
far
as
appearances
went
he
was
not
a
fit
candidate
for
any
office
however
humble
but
she
answered
diplomatically
i
will
inquire
into
the
condition
of
politics
in
this
district
boglin
and
try
to
determine
which
candidate
is
the
most
deserving
having
reached
a
decision
the
will
espouse
the
cause
of
the
best
man
if
it
mentions
local
politics
at
all
the
hon
ojoy
gave
a
dissatisfied
grunt
that
means
in
plain
words
he
suggested
that
you
give
kleppish
a
chance
to
bid
against
me
but
i
need
this
paper
and
i
willin
to
pay
a
big
price
for
it
let
kleppish
go
and
we
make
our
dicker
right
now
on
a
basis
it
the
only
way
you
can
make
your
paper
pay
i
got
money
miss
doyle
i
own
six
farms
near
hooker
falls
which
is
in
this
county
and
six
hundred
acres
of
good
pine
forest
and
director
in
the
bank
of
huntingdon
with
plenty
of
money
out
on
interest
also
i
own
half
the
stock
in
the
new
paper
mill
at
royal
you
do
she
exclaimed
i
thought
skeelty
skeelty
the
head
man
of
course
he
said
he
came
to
me
about
the
mill
proposition
and
i
went
in
with
him
i
own
all
the
forest
around
royal
bein
manager
and
knowin
the
business
skeelty
stood
out
for
shares
of
stock
which
is
the
controllin
interest
but
i
own
all
the
rest
and
the
mill
makin
good
money
people
do
know
i
in
that
deal
and
of
course
this
is
all
confidential
and
not
to
be
talked
about
very
well
sir
but
i
fear
you
have
mistaken
the
character
of
our
paper
said
patsy
quietly
we
are
quite
independent
boglin
and
intend
to
remain
so
even
if
we
ca
make
the
paper
pay
in
other
words
the
daily
ca
be
bought
he
stared
in
amazement
then
scratched
his
ear
with
a
puzzled
air
such
talk
as
that
means
somethin
he
asserted
gropingly
but
what
it
means
blamed
if
i
know
newspapers
never
turn
money
down
unless
they
bought
or
have
got
a
grouch
of
their
own
say
he
suddenly
cried
as
an
inspiration
struck
him
you
ai
got
anything
agin
the
mill
at
royal
or
agin
skeelty
have
you
i
have
sir
declared
patsy
raising
her
head
to
frown
discouragingly
upon
the
ojoy
skeelty
is
acting
in
a
very
disagreeable
manner
he
has
not
only
boycotted
our
paper
and
refused
to
pay
for
the
subscriptions
he
engaged
but
i
understand
he
is
encouraging
his
workmen
to
annoy
the
millville
people
and
especially
this
printing
office
well
durn
skeelty
ejaculated
boglin
greatly
discomposed
by
this
statement
but
i
fix
all
that
miss
doyle
he
added
eagerly
skeelty
my
partner
and
he
got
to
do
what
i
say
or
i
make
trouble
for
him
you
dicker
with
me
for
the
support
of
your
paper
and
guarantee
a
hundred
subscriptions
from
royal
and
get
you
an
apology
from
skeelty
and
a
promise
he
behave
an
keep
his
men
to
home
and
all
that
outside
the
price
i
agree
to
pay
patsy
eyes
were
full
of
scorn
i
wo
dicker
with
you
an
instant
she
firmly
declared
i
do
know
colonel
kleppish
or
what
his
character
is
but
i
very
sure
he
the
better
man
and
that
the
people
have
made
no
mistake
in
electing
him
in
your
place
no
respectable
candidate
for
office
would
attempt
to
buy
the
support
of
a
newspaper
and
i
advise
you
to
change
the
wording
on
your
card
instead
of
it
should
read
ojoy
boglin
good
day
sir
boglin
face
turned
white
with
rage
he
half
rose
from
his
seat
but
sat
down
again
with
a
vicious
snarl
i
coaxed
so
far
young
woman
he
said
grimly
but
i
guess
time
i
showed
my
hand
you
either
run
this
paper
in
my
interest
or
i
push
skeelty
on
to
make
the
town
too
hot
to
hold
you
i
got
power
in
this
county
even
if
i
ai
senator
and
you
feel
that
power
if
you
dare
oppose
me
take
your
choice
girl
either
to
make
good
money
out
o
this
campaign
or
be
run
out
of
town
neck
an
crop
up
to
you
to
decide
in
thirty
seconds
said
patsy
her
face
as
white
as
was
boglin
i
shall
ring
this
bell
to
summon
my
men
to
throw
you
out
the
ojoy
slowly
rose
and
put
on
his
hat
look
out
he
said
warningly
i
will
snapped
patsy
this
ai
the
end
of
it
girl
there
are
ten
seconds
left
she
said
he
picked
up
his
card
turned
his
back
and
walked
out
leaving
his
opponent
trembling
betwixt
agitation
and
righteous
indignation
a
few
moments
later
bob
west
came
in
and
looked
at
the
girl
editor
curiously
ojoy
boglin
has
been
here
he
said
the
ojoy
if
you
please
answered
patsy
with
a
laugh
that
bordered
on
hysteria
the
hardware
man
nodded
his
eyes
reading
her
face
you
were
quite
right
to
turn
him
down
he
asserted
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
responded
the
girl
wondering
how
he
knew
but
boglin
is
a
dangerous
man
resumed
west
look
out
for
him
miss
doyle
yes
he
told
me
to
do
that
and
i
will
said
she
more
quietly
he
is
skeelty
partner
and
you
not
afraid
of
him
why
should
i
be
mr
west
he
smiled
i
justice
of
the
peace
here
if
there
a
hint
of
trouble
from
boglin
or
skeelty
come
directly
to
me
thank
you
west
i
will
with
this
he
nodded
cheerfully
and
went
away
chapter
xii
molly
sizer
party
the
people
of
chazy
county
were
very
proud
of
the
the
only
daily
paper
in
that
section
of
the
state
it
was
really
a
very
good
newspaper
if
small
in
size
and
related
the
news
of
the
day
as
promptly
as
the
great
new
york
journals
did
arthur
weldon
had
not
been
very
enthusiastic
about
the
paper
at
any
time
although
he
humored
the
girls
by
attending
in
a
way
to
the
advertising
hiring
some
of
the
country
folk
to
get
subscriptions
and
keeping
the
books
he
was
a
young
man
of
considerable
education
who
had
inherited
a
large
fortune
safely
invested
and
therefore
had
no
need
through
financial
necessity
to
interest
himself
in
business
of
any
sort
he
allowed
the
girls
to
print
his
name
as
editor
in
chief
but
he
did
no
editorial
work
at
all
amusing
himself
these
delightful
summer
days
by
wandering
in
the
woods
where
he
collected
botanical
specimens
or
sitting
with
uncle
john
on
the
lawn
where
they
read
together
or
played
chess
both
the
men
were
glad
the
girls
were
happy
in
their
work
and
enthusiastic
over
the
success
of
their
audacious
venture
beth
was
developing
decided
talent
as
a
writer
of
editorials
and
her
articles
were
even
more
thoughtful
and
dignified
than
were
those
of
patsy
the
two
girls
found
plenty
to
occupy
them
at
the
office
while
louise
did
the
reportorial
work
and
flitted
through
millville
and
down
to
huntingdon
each
day
in
search
of
small
items
of
local
interest
she
grew
fond
of
this
work
for
it
brought
her
close
to
the
people
and
enabled
her
to
study
their
characters
and
peculiarities
her
manner
of
approaching
the
simple
country
folk
was
so
gracious
and
winning
that
they
freely
gave
her
any
information
they
possessed
and
chatted
with
her
unreservedly
sometimes
louise
would
make
her
rounds
alone
but
often
arthur
would
join
her
for
an
afternoon
drive
to
huntingdon
and
it
greatly
amused
him
to
listen
to
his
adroit
manner
of
pumping
the
natives
about
halfway
to
huntingdon
was
the
sizer
farm
the
largest
and
most
important
in
that
vicinity
old
zeke
sizer
had
a
large
family
five
boys
and
three
girls
and
they
were
noted
as
quite
the
most
aggressive
and
disturbing
element
in
the
neighborhood
old
zeke
was
rude
and
coarse
and
swore
like
a
trooper
so
his
sons
could
not
be
expected
to
excel
him
in
refinement
bill
sizer
the
eldest
was
a
hard
drinker
and
people
who
knew
him
asserted
that
he
never
drew
a
sober
breath
the
other
sons
were
all
quarrelsome
in
disposition
and
many
a
free
fight
was
indulged
in
among
them
whenever
disputes
arose
they
were
industrious
farmers
though
and
the
three
girls
and
their
mother
worked
from
morning
till
night
so
the
farm
prospered
and
the
sizers
were
reputed
to
be
molly
the
eldest
girl
had
attracted
louise
who
declared
she
was
pretty
enough
to
arrest
attention
in
any
place
indeed
this
girl
was
a
raving
beauty
in
her
buxom
countrified
way
and
her
good
looks
were
the
pride
of
the
sizer
family
and
the
admiration
of
the
neighbors
the
other
two
were
bouncing
merry
girls
rather
coarse
in
manner
as
might
be
expected
from
their
environment
but
molly
perhaps
fully
conscious
of
her
prettiness
assumed
certain
airs
and
graces
and
a
regal
deportment
that
brought
even
her
big
brutal
brothers
to
her
feet
in
adoration
the
sizers
were
among
the
first
subscribers
to
the
and
whenever
louise
stopped
at
the
farmhouse
for
news
the
family
would
crowd
around
her
ignoring
all
duties
and
volunteer
whatever
information
they
possessed
for
when
they
read
their
own
gossip
in
the
local
column
it
gave
them
a
sort
of
proprietary
interest
in
the
paper
and
bill
had
once
thrashed
a
young
clerk
at
huntingdon
for
questioning
the
truth
of
an
item
the
sizers
had
contributed
one
day
when
louise
and
arthur
stopped
at
the
farm
mollie
ran
out
with
an
eager
face
to
say
that
friday
was
her
birthday
and
the
sizers
were
to
give
a
grand
party
to
celebrate
it
we
want
you
to
come
over
an
write
it
up
weldon
said
the
girl
they
comin
from
twenty
mile
around
fer
the
dance
an
we
got
the
orchestry
from
malvern
to
play
for
us
pop
goin
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
refreshments
an
it
be
the
biggest
chazy
county
ever
seen
i
think
i
can
write
up
the
party
without
being
present
mollie
suggested
louise
no
you
come
over
i
read
once
in
a
novel
how
an
editor
come
to
a
swell
party
an
writ
about
all
the
dresses
an
things
said
what
everybody
wore
you
know
i
goin
to
have
a
new
dress
an
if
described
right
well
we
buy
a
lot
of
papers
to
send
to
folks
we
know
in
connecticut
well
said
louise
with
a
sigh
i
try
to
drive
over
for
a
little
while
it
is
to
be
saturday
you
say
yes
the
birthday
friday
and
the
dance
saturday
night
rain
or
shine
an
you
might
bring
the
chief
editor
your
husband
an
try
a
dance
with
us
it
would
hurt
our
reputation
any
to
have
you
folks
mingle
with
us
on
this
festive
occasion
she
added
airily
they
had
a
good
laugh
over
this
invitation
when
it
was
reported
at
merrick
dinner
table
and
patsy
insisted
that
louise
must
write
up
the
party
it
will
be
fun
to
give
it
a
head
and
a
big
she
said
write
it
up
as
if
it
were
a
real
society
event
dear
and
exhaust
your
vocabulary
on
the
gowns
you
have
to
invent
some
frenchy
names
to
describe
those
i
guess
for
they
be
wonders
and
we
wind
up
with
a
list
of
present
so
on
saturday
evening
arthur
drove
his
wife
over
to
the
sizer
farm
and
long
before
they
reached
there
they
heard
the
scraping
of
fiddles
mingled
with
shouts
and
boisterous
laughter
it
was
a
prohibition
district
to
be
sure
but
old
sizer
had
imported
from
somewhere
outside
the
dry
zone
a
quantity
of
liquors
more
remarkable
for
strength
than
quality
and
with
these
the
guests
had
been
plied
from
the
moment
of
their
arrival
most
of
them
were
wholly
unused
to
such
libations
so
by
the
time
arthur
and
louise
arrived
the
big
living
room
of
the
farmhouse
presented
an
appearance
of
wild
revelry
that
was
quite
deplorable
molly
welcomed
them
with
wild
enthusiasm
and
big
bill
her
adoring
brother
demanded
in
a
loud
voice
if
arthur
did
not
consider
her
the
belle
of
chazy
county
they
ai
a
stunner
in
the
state
as
kin
hold
a
candle
to
our
molly
he
added
and
then
with
uncertain
gait
he
left
the
reporters
with
the
promise
to
bring
a
drink
come
louise
said
arthur
quietly
let
get
out
of
here
he
drew
her
to
the
door
and
as
a
dance
was
just
starting
they
managed
to
escape
without
notice
what
a
disgraceful
scene
cried
louise
when
they
were
on
their
way
home
and
to
think
of
such
a
shocking
carousal
being
held
in
good
old
chazy
county
where
morals
are
usually
irreproachable
i
shall
not
mention
the
affair
in
the
at
all
but
patsy
who
had
a
managing
editor
respect
for
news
of
any
sort
combatted
this
determination
and
begged
louise
to
write
up
molly
party
without
referring
to
its
deplorable
features
it
is
policy
to
offend
the
sizers
she
said
for
although
they
are
coarse
and
common
they
have
shown
a
friendly
spirit
toward
the
paper
moreover
the
enmity
of
such
people
which
would
surely
result
from
our
ignoring
the
birthday
party
would
keep
us
in
hot
water
so
louise
though
reluctantly
wrote
up
the
party
and
the
manuscript
was
sent
over
to
miss
briggs
sunday
afternoon
so
it
would
get
a
place
in
monday
morning
uncle
john
had
the
paper
at
breakfast
on
monday
and
he
gave
an
amused
laugh
as
his
eye
caught
the
report
of
the
sizer
party
this
is
a
good
one
on
you
louise
he
exclaimed
you
say
that
miss
molly
more
lovely
than
ever
in
her
handsome
new
gown
greeted
her
guests
with
a
roughish
smile
a
what
demanded
louise
horrified
a
smile
oh
that
a
mistake
she
said
glancing
at
the
item
what
i
said
was
a
smile
but
there
been
a
typographical
error
which
miss
briggs
must
have
overlooked
in
reading
the
proof
nevertheless
remarked
arthur
the
statement
is
far
wrong
everything
was
rough
including
the
smiles
as
far
as
i
noted
that
remarkable
gathering
but
see
here
cried
patsy
that
a
dreadful
mistake
that
spoils
all
the
nice
things
you
said
about
the
girl
louise
i
hope
the
sizers
wo
notice
it
but
the
sizers
did
and
were
frantic
with
rage
over
what
they
deemed
was
a
deliberate
insult
to
molly
several
young
men
who
had
come
from
distances
to
attend
the
birthday
party
had
stayed
over
sunday
at
the
farmhouse
where
the
revelry
still
continued
in
a
fitful
way
due
to
vain
attempts
to
relieve
racking
headaches
by
further
libations
monday
morning
found
the
dissipated
crew
still
the
guests
of
the
sizers
and
when
big
bill
slowly
spelled
out
the
assertion
made
by
the
that
his
sister
had
a
roughish
smile
loud
cries
of
indignation
arose
molly
first
cried
and
then
had
hysterics
and
screamed
vigorously
bill
swore
vengeance
on
the
and
all
connected
with
it
while
the
guests
gravely
asserted
it
was
a
measly
trick
which
the
sizers
ought
to
resent
they
all
began
drinking
again
to
calm
their
feelings
and
after
the
midday
dinner
bill
sizer
grabbed
a
huge
cowhide
whip
and
started
to
millville
to
lick
the
editor
to
a
standstill
a
wagonload
of
his
guests
accompanied
him
and
molly
pleaded
with
her
brother
not
to
hurt
weldon
i
wo
but
i
cowhide
that
fresh
husband
of
hers
declared
bill
he
the
editor
the
paper
says
so
and
he
the
one
i
after
chapter
xiii
bob
west
interferes
it
was
unfortunate
that
at
that
time
thursday
smith
had
gone
up
the
electric
line
toward
royal
to
inspect
it
in
the
office
were
patsy
hetty
hewitt
who
was
making
a
drawing
arthur
weldon
engaged
upon
his
books
and
finally
seated
in
an
from
which
he
silently
watched
them
work
old
bob
west
the
hardware
man
louise
and
beth
had
driven
over
to
the
junction
to
write
up
an
accident
one
of
the
trainmen
having
caught
his
hand
in
a
coupling
between
two
freight
cars
bob
west
often
dropped
into
the
office
which
was
next
door
to
his
own
place
of
business
but
he
was
a
silent
man
and
had
little
to
say
on
these
visits
in
his
early
days
he
had
wandered
pretty
much
over
the
whole
world
and
he
could
relate
some
interesting
personal
adventures
if
he
chose
in
this
retired
village
west
was
the
one
inhabitant
distinguished
above
his
fellows
for
his
knowledge
of
the
world
in
his
rooms
over
the
store
where
few
were
ever
invited
he
had
a
fine
library
of
unusual
books
and
a
rare
collection
of
curios
gathered
from
foreign
lands
it
was
natural
that
such
a
man
would
be
interested
in
so
unique
an
experiment
as
the
and
he
watched
its
conduct
with
curiosity
but
a
constantly
growing
respect
for
the
three
girl
journalists
no
one
ever
minded
when
he
came
into
the
office
nodded
and
sat
down
sometimes
he
would
converse
with
much
freedom
at
other
times
the
old
gentleman
remained
an
hour
without
offering
a
remark
and
went
away
with
a
brief
parting
nod
it
was
west
who
first
saw
through
the
window
the
wagonload
of
men
from
the
sizer
farm
come
dashing
up
the
street
at
a
gallop
instinctively
perhaps
he
knew
trouble
was
brewing
but
he
never
altered
his
expression
or
his
attitude
even
when
the
wagon
stopped
at
the
printing
office
and
the
passengers
leaped
out
in
marched
bill
sizer
at
the
head
of
his
following
cowhide
in
hand
patsy
her
face
flushing
scarlet
stood
up
and
faced
the
intruders

sizer
in
a
fierce
tone

murmured
his
friends
approvingly
arthur
leaned
back
and
regarded
his
accuser
in
wonder
the
big
table
littered
with
papers
was
between
them
come
out
o
there

measly

why
this
lyin
scroundrel

in

cried
his
friends
encouragingly
but
wait
a
moment
commanded
west
as
the
maddened
half
drunken
young
farmer
was
about
to
leap
over
the
table
to
grasp
his
victim
you

going
at
this
thing
right
bill
sizer
why

i
bob

answered
west
in
calm

tones
this
insult

too
great
to

avenged
by
a
mere
cowhiding
nothing
but
blood

wipe
away
the
dreadful
stain

your
sister
character

cried
patsy
horrified
by
such
a
statement
eh

said
bill
stupefied
by
the
suggestion
of
course
returned
west
you
must
thrash
weldon
you
must
kill
him
a
delighted
chorus
of
approval
came
from
sizer
supporters
all
right
then
said
the
bully
glaring
around
i
i
kill
the
scandler
hold
on
counselled
west
seizing
his
arm
this
affair
must
be
conducted
properly
otherwise
the
law

trouble
no
murder
mind
you
you
must
kill
weldon
in
a
duel

a
what

duel
gasped
sizer
to
be
sure
that

way

be
revenged
hetty
he
added
turning
to
the
artist
who
alone
of
the
observers
had
smiled
instead
of
groaned
at
the
old
gentleman
startling
suggestion
will
you
kindly
run
up
to
my
rooms
and
get
a
red
leather
case
that
lies
under
the
shell
cabinet
thank
you
my
dear
hetty
was
off
like
a
flash
during
her
absence
an
intense
silence
pervaded
the
office
broken
only
by
an
occasional
hiccough
from
one
of
sizer
guests
patsy
was
paralyzed
with
horror
and
had
fallen
back
into
her
chair
to
glare
alternately
at
bob
west
and
the
big
bully
who
threatened
her
cousin
husband
arthur
was
pale
and
stern
as
he
fixed
a
reproachful
gaze
on
the
hardware
merchant
from
miss
briggs
little
room
could
be
heard
the
steady
of
the
telegraph
instrument
but
the
furious
arrival
of
the
sizer
party
had
aroused
every
inhabitant
of
millville
and
with
one
accord
they
dropped
work
and
rushed
to
the
printing
office
by
this
time
the
windows
were
dark
with
groups
of
eager
faces
that
peered
wonderingly
through
the
screens
the
sashes
being
up
and
listened
to
the
conversation
within
while
hetty
was
gone
not
a
word
was
spoken
but
the
artist
was
absent
only
a
brief
time
presently
she
reentered
and
laid
the
red
leather
case
on
the
table
before
bob
west
the
hardware
man
at
once
opened
it
displaying
a
pair
of
dueling
pistols
with
long
barrels
and
pearl
handles
there
was
a
small
can
of
powder
some
bullets
and
wadding
in
the
case
and
as
west
took
up
one
of
the
pistols
and
proceeded
to
load
it
he
said
in
an
unconcerned
voice
i
once
got
these
from
an
officer
in
vienna
and
they
have
been
used
in
more
than
a
score
of
duels
i
was
told
one
of
the
pistols
i
tell
which
it
is
has
killed
a
dozen
men
so
you
are
going
to
fight
with
famous
weapons
both
arthur
and
bill
sizer
as
well
as
the
groups
at
the
window
watched
the
loading
of
the
pistols
with
fascinated
gaze
bob
a
queer
ol
feller
whispered
peggy
mcnutt
to
the
blacksmith
who
stood
beside
him
this
dool
is
just
one
o
his
odd
fancies
much
he
keers
ef
they
kills
each
other
er
not
west
cried
patsy
suddenly
rousing
from
her
apathy
i
not
allow
this
shameful
thing
a
duel
is
no
better
than
murder
and
i
sure
there
is
a
law
against
it
true
returned
west
ramming
the
bullet
into
the
second
pistol
it
is
quite
irregular
and
er
illegal
i
believe
perhaps
i
shall
go
to
jail
with
whichever
of
the
duelists
survives
but
you
see
it
is
a
point
of
honor
with
us
all
molly
sizer
has
seemingly
been
grossly
maligned
in
your
paper
and
the
editor
is
responsible
are
you
a
good
shot
bill
i
i
guess
so
stammered
sizer
that
good
weldon
i
hear
is
an
expert
with
the
pistol
arthur
did
not
contradict
this
statement
although
he
was
positive
he
could
not
hit
a
barn
at
twenty
yards
now
then
are
we
ready
staid
west
rising
come
with
me
gentlemen
what
ye
goin
to
do
bob
asked
sizer
anxiously
i
explain
replied
the
hardware
man
leading
the
way
to
the
street
everyone
followed
him
and
the
crowd
at
the
windows
joined
the
group
outside
of
course
you
must
shoot
in
the
main
street
for
you
might
hit
some
one
or
break
windows
but
back
of
this
row
of
buildings
is
a
lane
that
is
perfectly
clear
you
will
stand
back
to
back
in
the
center
of
the
block
and
then
at
my
word
you
will
each
march
to
the
end
of
the
block
and
pass
around
the
buildings
to
the
lane
as
soon
as
you
come
in
sight
of
one
another
you
are
privileged
to
fire
and
i
suppose
bill
sizer
will
try
to
kill
you
weldon
on
the
spot
and
therefore
you
will
try
to
kill
him
first
but
look
bob
cried
sizer
it
ai
right
fer
him
to
take
a
shot
at
me
you
said
fer
me
to
kill
him
but
ye
did
say
about
shootin
at
that
all
right
bill
returned
west
you
in
the
right
and
the
right
ought
to
win
but
you
must
give
the
man
a
chance
for
his
life
you
know
that
were
in
the
bargain
it
is
now
by
the
laws
of
dueling
he
he
might
shoot
me
urged
bill
it
is
likely
although
he
a
dead
shot
you
have
right
on
your
side
and
you
must
be
sure
to
fire
as
soon
as
you
get
within
good
range
it
wo
be
considered
murder
it
will
only
be
a
duel
and
the
law
will
deal
lightly
with
you
that
right
bill
asserted
one
of
sizer
friends
bob
west
a
justice
o
the
peace
himself
an
he
orter
know
i
do
know
declared
west
gravely
he
placed
arthur
weldon
and
bill
sizer
back
to
back
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
handed
each
a
pistol
now
then
said
he
you
both
understand
the
rules
which
i
have
explained
and
the
spectators
will
bear
witness
that
whatever
happens
this
affair
has
been
conducted
in
a
regular
manner
with
no
favor
shown
to
either
you
are
both
brave
men
and
this
duel
will
vindicate
your
honor
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
survive
you
will
be
heroes
and
all
your
differences
will
be
wiped
off
the
slate
but
as
one
or
both
may
fall
we
the
citizens
of
millville
hereby
bid
you
a
solemn
and
sad
farewell
impressed
by
this
speech
sizer
friends
began
to
shake
hands
with
him
all
ready
called
west
one
two
three
go
at
the
word
the
two
back
to
back
started
for
the
opposite
ends
of
the
little
street
and
at
once
the
crowd
made
a
rush
between
the
buildings
to
gain
the
rear
where
they
might
witness
the
shooting
in
the
lane
when
the
duelists
met
arthur
had
been
thinking
seriously
during
these
proceedings
and
had
made
up
his
mind
it
was
in
no
degree
his
duty
to
be
bored
full
of
holes
by
a
drunken
countryman
like
bill
sizer
just
because
there
had
been
a
typographical
error
in
the
so
when
he
got
to
the
end
of
the
street
instead
of
turning
into
the
lane
he
made
for
the
farm
holding
the
long
dueling
pistol
gingerly
in
his
hand
and
trotting
at
a
good
pace
for
home
footsteps
followed
him
in
sudden
panic
he
increased
his
run
but
the
other
was
faster
a
heavy
hand
grasped
his
shoulder
and
swung
him
around
while
old
bob
west
panting
for
breath
exclaimed
stop
you
fool
stop
the
other
one
is
running
the
other
one
echoed
arthur
wonderingly
of
course
bill
sizer
was
sure
to
run
he
a
coward
as
all
bullies
are
quick
weldon
save
the
day
and
your
reputation
or
i
never
stand
your
friend
again
arthur
understood
now
he
turned
and
ran
back
faster
than
he
had
come
swung
into
the
lane
where
the
crowd
was
cautiously
peering
from
the
shelter
of
the
buildings
and
waving
his
pistol
in
a
reckless
way
that
made
bob
west
shudder
he
cried
out
where
is
he
where
sizer
why
do
he
show
up
and
be
shot
like
a
man
no
sizer
appeared
he
was
even
then
headed
for
home
leaving
his
friends
to
bemoan
his
cowardice
as
for
arthur
the
crowd
gave
him
a
cheer
and
condemned
his
opponent
conduct
in
no
measured
terms
they
were
terribly
disappointed
by
big
bill
defection
for
while
not
especially
bloodthirsty
they
hated
to
see
the
impending
tragedy
turn
out
a
farce
in
the
printing
office
patsy
was
laughing
hysterically
as
her
horror
dissolved
and
allowed
her
to
discover
the
comic
phase
of
the
duel
she
literally
fell
on
arthur
neck
as
he
entered
but
the
next
moment
pushed
him
away
to
face
the
hardware
merchant
i
beg
your
pardon
west
said
she
with
twinkling
eyes
i
suspected
you
of
being
a
ruffian
when
you
proposed
this
duel
but
i
now
see
that
you
understand
human
nature
better
than
the
whole
caboodle
of
us
put
together
arthur
thank
west
for
saving
you
from
a
flogging
i
do
indeed
said
arthur
fervently
chapter
xiv
the
danger
signal
by
this
time
the
had
become
the
pride
of
all
millville
yet
the
villagers
could
not
quite
overcome
their
awe
and
wonder
at
it
also
the
newspaper
was
the
pride
of
the
three
girl
journalists
who
under
the
tutelage
of
miss
briggs
were
learning
to
understand
the
complicated
system
of
a
daily
journal
their
amateurish
efforts
were
gradually
giving
way
to
more
dignified
and
readable
articles
beth
could
write
an
editorial
that
interested
even
uncle
john
her
severest
critic
louise
showed
exceptional
talent
for
picking
up
local
happenings
and
making
news
notes
of
them
while
patsy
grabbed
everything
that
came
to
her
net
locals
editorials
telegraphic
and
telephone
reports
from
all
parts
of
the
world
and
skillfully
sorted
edited
and
arranged
them
for
the
various
departments
of
the
paper
it
was
mighty
interesting
to
them
all
and
they
were
so
eager
each
morning
to
get
to
work
that
they
could
scarcely
devote
the
proper
time
to
old
nora
famous
breakfasts
we
made
a
mistake
uncle
said
patsy
to
merrick
in
starting
the
in
the
wrong
place
in
a
few
weeks
we
must
leave
it
and
go
back
to
the
city
whereas
had
we
established
our
paper
in
new
york
then
it
never
would
have
been
heard
of
interrupted
practical
beth
in
new
york
patsy
dear
we
would
become
the
laughing
stock
of
the
town
i
shudder
when
i
think
what
a
countrified
paper
we
turned
out
that
first
issue
but
we
are
fast
becoming
educated
declared
patsy
i
not
ashamed
of
the
now
even
in
comparison
with
the
best
new
york
dailies
beth
laughed
but
uncle
john
said
judicially
for
millville
it
certainly
a
marvel
i
get
the
world
news
more
concisely
and
more
pleasantly
from
its
four
pages
than
when
i
wade
through
twenty
or
thirty
of
the
big
pages
of
a
metropolitan
newspaper
you
are
doing
famously
my
dears
i
congratulate
you
but
we
are
running
behind
dreadfully
suggested
arthur
the
bookkeeper
even
since
thursday
smith
enabled
us
to
cut
down
expenses
so
greatly
the
money
that
comes
in
never
equals
what
we
pay
out
how
long
can
you
keep
this
up
girls
they
made
no
reply
nor
did
uncle
john
discuss
the
financial
condition
of
the
newspaper
he
was
himself
paying
some
heavy
expenses
that
did
not
appear
on
the
books
such
as
the
associated
press
franchise
the
telegraph
bills
and
the
electric
power
but
he
was
quite
delighted
to
take
care
of
these
items
and
regretted
he
had
not
assumed
more
of
the
paper
obligations
he
knew
the
expenses
were
eating
big
holes
in
the
incomes
of
his
three
nieces
yet
they
never
complained
nor
allowed
their
enthusiasm
to
flag
merrick
who
had
tested
these
girls
in
more
ways
than
one
was
watching
them
carefully
and
fully
approved
their
spirit
and
courage
under
such
trying
conditions
major
doyle
patsy
father
when
the
first
copy
of
the
was
laid
on
his
desk
in
the
city
was
astounded
at
the
audacity
of
this
rash
venture
when
he
could
command
his
temper
to
write
calmly
he
sent
a
letter
to
merrick
which
read
taken
altogether
john
you
the
craziest
bunch
of
irresponsibles
outside
an
asylum
no
wonder
you
kept
this
folly
a
secret
from
me
until
you
had
accomplished
your
nefarious
designs
the
daily
is
a
corker
and
no
mistake
for
our
patsy
at
the
head
of
your
lunatic
gang
i
go
farther
and
say
the
paper
a
wonder
i
believe
it
is
the
first
daily
newspaper
published
in
a
town
of
six
inhabitants
that
has
ever
carried
the
associated
press
dispatches
but
allow
me
to
ask
why
the
lonely
inhabitants
of
the
desert
of
chazy
county
do
need
a
daily
or
a
weekly
or
a
monthly
a
would
about
hit
their
gait
and
be
more
than
they
deserve
so
decided
it
merely
a
silly
way
to
spend
money
and
an
easy
way
too
i
be
bound
oblige
me
by
explaining
this
incomprehensible
eccentricity
to
this
a
mild
protest
for
the
major
uncle
john
replied
dear
major
doyle
yours
received
have
you
no
business
of
your
own
to
attend
to
affectionately
yours
john
merrick
the
major
took
the
hint
he
made
no
further
complaint
but
read
the
paper
religiously
every
day
gloating
over
patsy
name
as
managing
editor
and
preserving
the
files
with
great
care
he
really
enjoyed
the
and
as
his
summer
vacation
was
shortly
due
he
anticipated
with
pleasure
a
visit
to
the
farm
and
a
peep
at
the
workings
of
our
patsy
famous
newspaper
the
other
girls
he
ignored
if
patsy
was
connected
with
the
thing
her
adoring
parent
was
quite
sure
she
was
responsible
for
all
the
good
there
was
in
it
the
paper
printed
no
mention
of
the
famous
duel
but
hetty
made
a
cartoon
of
it
showing
the
lane
with
its
fringe
of
spectators
arthur
weldon
standing
manfully
to
await
his
antagonist
and
big
bill
sizer
in
the
distance
sprinting
across
the
fields
in
the
direction
of
home
this
cartoon
was
highly
prized
by
those
who
had
witnessed
the
adventure
and
peggy
mcnutt
pinned
it
on
the
wall
of
his
real
estate
office
beside
the
one
hetty
had
made
of
himself
bill
sizer
promptly
stopped
the
paper
that
being
the
only
vengeance
at
hand
and
when
bob
west
sent
a
boy
to
him
demanding
the
return
of
the
pistol
bill
dispatched
with
the
weapon
the
following
characteristic
note
which
he
had
penned
with
much
labor
bob
west
sir
you
beet
me
out
uv
my
reeveng
and
made
me
look
like
a
bag
uv
beens
but
i
will
skware
this
thing
sum
da
and
yu
and
that
edyter
hed
better
watch
out
i
do
stand
fer
no
throwdown
like
that
wm
sizer
however
the
bully
received
scant
sympathy
even
from
his
most
intimate
friends
and
his
prestige
in
the
community
was
henceforth
destroyed
arthur
did
not
crow
for
his
part
he
told
the
girls
frankly
of
his
attempt
to
run
away
and
evade
the
meeting
which
sensible
intention
was
only
frustrated
by
bob
west
interference
and
they
all
agreed
he
was
thoroughly
justified
the
young
man
had
proved
to
them
his
courage
years
before
and
none
of
the
girls
was
disposed
to
accuse
him
of
cowardice
for
not
wishing
to
shoot
or
be
shot
by
such
a
person
as
bill
sizer
a
few
days
following
the
duel
another
incident
occurred
which
was
of
a
nature
so
startling
that
it
drove
the
sizer
comedy
from
all
minds
this
time
thursday
smith
was
the
hero
hetty
hewitt
it
seems
was
having
a
desperate
struggle
to
quell
the
longings
of
her
heart
for
the
allurements
of
the
great
city
she
had
been
for
years
a
thorough
bohemienne
frequenting
cafes
theatres
and
dance
halls
smoking
and
drinking
with
men
and
women
of
her
class
and
by
degrees
losing
every
womanly
quality
with
which
nature
had
generously
endowed
her
but
the
girl
was
not
really
bad
she
was
essentially
nervous
and
craved
excitement
so
she
had
drifted
into
this
sort
of
life
because
no
counteracting
influence
of
good
had
been
injected
into
her
pliable
disposition
none
that
is
until
the
friendly
editor
for
whom
she
worked
anticipating
her
final
downfall
had
sought
to
save
her
by
sending
her
to
a
country
newspaper
he
talked
to
the
girl
artist
very
frankly
before
she
left
for
millville
and
hetty
knew
he
was
right
and
was
truly
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
redeem
herself
the
sweet
girl
journalists
with
whom
she
was
thrown
in
contact
were
so
different
from
any
young
women
she
had
heretofore
known
and
proved
so
kindly
sympathetic
that
hetty
speedily
became
ashamed
of
her
wasted
life
and
formed
a
brave
resolution
to
merit
the
friendship
so
generously
extended
her
but
it
was
hard
work
at
first
she
could
get
through
the
days
easily
enough
by
wandering
in
the
woods
and
taking
long
walks
along
the
rugged
country
roads
but
in
the
evenings
came
the
insistent
call
of
the
cafes
the
cheap
orchestras
vaudeville
midnight
suppers
and
the
like
she
strenuously
fought
this
yearning
and
found
it
was
growing
less
and
less
powerful
to
influence
her
but
her
nights
were
yet
restless
and
her
nerves
throbbing
from
the
effects
of
past
dissipations
often
she
would
find
herself
unable
to
sleep
and
would
go
out
into
the
moonlight
when
all
others
were
in
bed
and
prowl
around
with
the
cats
as
she
expressed
it
until
the
wee
hours
of
morning
often
she
told
patsy
she
wished
there
was
more
work
she
could
do
the
drawings
required
by
the
paper
never
occupied
her
more
than
a
couple
of
hours
each
day
sometimes
she
made
one
of
her
cleverest
cartoons
in
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
ca
i
do
something
else
she
begged
let
me
set
type
or
run
the
ticker
i
can
receive
telegrams
fairly
well
or
even
write
a
column
of
local
comment
i
no
journalist
so
you
not
be
envious
but
patsy
shook
her
head
really
hetty
there
nothing
else
you
can
do
and
your
pictures
are
very
important
to
us
rest
and
enjoy
yourself
and
get
strong
and
well
you
are
improving
wonderfully
in
health
since
you
came
here
often
at
midnight
hetty
would
wander
into
the
pressroom
and
watch
thursday
smith
run
off
the
edition
on
the
wonderful
press
which
seemed
to
possess
an
intelligence
of
its
own
so
perfectly
did
it
perform
its
functions
at
such
times
she
sat
listlessly
by
and
said
little
for
thursday
was
no
voluble
talker
especially
when
busied
over
his
press
but
a
certain
spirit
of
comradeship
grew
up
between
these
two
and
it
was
not
unusual
for
the
pressmen
after
his
work
was
finished
and
the
papers
were
neatly
piled
for
distribution
to
the
carriers
at
daybreak
to
walk
with
hetty
to
the
hotel
before
proceeding
to
his
own
lodgings
in
the
little
wing
of
nick
thorne
house
which
stood
quite
at
the
end
of
the
street
to
be
sure
the
hotel
adjoined
the
printing
office
with
only
a
vacant
lot
between
but
hetty
seemed
to
appreciate
this
courtesy
and
would
exchange
a
brief
good
night
with
smith
before
going
to
her
own
room
afterward
she
not
infrequently
stole
out
again
because
sleep
would
not
come
to
her
and
then
the
moon
watched
her
wanderings
until
it
dipped
behind
the
hills
on
the
night
we
speak
of
hetty
had
parted
from
thursday
smith
at
one
and
crept
into
the
hallway
of
the
silent
barnlike
hotel
but
as
soon
as
the
man
turned
away
she
issued
forth
again
and
walked
up
the
empty
street
like
a
shadow
almost
to
thompson
crossing
she
strolled
deep
in
thought
and
then
turned
and
retraced
her
steps
but
when
she
again
reached
the
hotel
she
was
as
ever
so
she
passed
the
building
thinking
she
would
go
on
to
little
bill
creek
and
sit
by
the
old
mill
for
a
time
the
girl
was
just
opposite
the
printing
office
when
her
attention
was
attracted
by
a
queer
grating
noise
as
if
one
of
the
windows
was
being
pried
up
she
stopped
short
a
moment
and
then
crept
closer
to
the
building
two
men
were
at
a
side
window
of
the
pressroom
which
they
had
just
succeeded
in
opening
as
hetty
gained
her
point
of
observation
one
of
the
men
slipped
inside
but
a
moment
later
hastily
reappeared
and
joined
his
fellow
at
once
both
turned
and
stole
along
the
side
of
the
shed
directly
toward
the
place
where
the
girl
stood
her
first
impulse
was
to
run
but
recollecting
that
she
wore
a
dark
gown
and
stood
in
deep
shadow
she
merely
flattened
herself
against
the
building
and
remained
motionless
the
men
were
chuckling
as
they
passed
her
and
she
recognized
them
as
mill
hands
from
royal
guess
that
do
the
job
said
one
in
a
low
tone
if
it
do
nothin
will
was
the
reply
they
were
gone
then
stealing
across
the
road
and
beating
a
hasty
retreat
under
the
shadows
of
the
houses
hetty
stood
motionless
a
moment
wondering
what
to
do
then
with
sudden
resolve
she
ran
to
thorne
house
and
rapped
sharply
at
the
window
of
the
wing
where
she
knew
thursday
smith
slept
she
heard
him
leap
from
bed
and
open
the
blind
what
is
it
he
asked
it
me
thursday
hetty
she
said
two
men
have
just
broken
into
the
pressroom
through
a
window
they
were
men
from
royal
and
they
steal
anything
but
ran
away
in
great
haste
i
i
afraid
something
is
wrong
thursday
even
while
she
spoke
he
was
rapidly
dressing
wait
he
called
to
her
in
a
few
moments
he
opened
the
door
and
joined
her
without
hesitation
he
began
walking
rapidly
toward
the
office
and
the
girl
kept
step
with
him
he
asked
no
questions
whatever
but
us
soon
as
she
had
led
him
to
the
open
window
he
leaped
through
it
and
switched
on
an
electric
light
an
instant
later
he
cried
aloud
in
a
voice
of
fear
get
out
hetty
run
for
your
life
run
yourself
thursday
if
there
danger
she
coolly
returned
but
he
shouted
run
run
run
in
such
thrilling
compelling
tones
that
the
girl
shrank
away
and
dashed
across
the
vacant
lot
to
the
hotel
before
she
turned
again
in
time
to
see
smith
leap
from
the
window
and
make
a
dash
toward
the
rear
he
was
carrying
something
something
extended
at
arms
length
before
him
and
he
crossed
the
lane
and
ran
far
into
the
field
before
stooping
to
set
down
his
burden
now
he
was
racing
back
again
running
as
madly
as
if
a
troop
of
demons
was
after
him
a
flash
cleft
the
darkness
a
deep
detonation
thundered
and
echoed
against
the
hills
the
building
against
which
hetty
leaned
shook
as
if
an
earthquake
had
seized
it
and
thursday
smith
was
thrown
flat
on
his
face
and
rolled
almost
to
the
terrified
girl
feet
where
he
lay
motionless
only
the
building
saved
her
from
pitching
headlong
too
but
as
the
reverberations
died
away
to
be
followed
by
frantic
screams
from
the
rudely
wakened
population
of
millville
hetty
sank
upon
her
knees
and
turned
the
man
over
so
that
he
lay
face
up
he
opened
his
eyes
and
put
up
one
hand
then
he
struggled
to
his
feet
trembling
weakly
and
his
white
face
smiled
into
the
girl
anxious
one
that
was
a
close
call
dear
he
whispered
but
your
timely
discovery
saved
us
from
a
terrible
calamity
i
i
do
believe
there
is
much
harm
done
as
it
is
hetty
made
no
reply
she
was
thinking
of
the
moments
he
had
held
that
deadly
thing
in
his
hands
while
he
strove
to
save
lives
and
property
from
destruction
the
inevitable
crowd
was
gathering
now
demanding
in
terrified
tones
what
had
happened
men
women
and
children
poured
from
the
houses
in
scant
attire
all
unnerved
and
fearful
crying
for
an
explanation
of
the
explosion
keep
mum
hetty
said
smith
warningly
it
will
do
no
good
to
tell
them
the
truth
she
nodded
realizing
it
was
best
the
villagers
did
not
suspect
that
an
enemy
of
the
newspaper
had
placed
them
all
in
dire
peril
dynamite
she
asked
in
a
whisper
yes
a
bomb
but
for
heaven
sake
do
mention
it
suddenly
a
man
with
a
lantern
discovered
a
great
pit
in
the
field
behind
the
lane
and
the
crowd
quickly
surrounded
it
from
their
limited
knowledge
of
the
facts
the
explosion
seemed
unaccountable
but
there
was
sufficient
intelligence
among
them
to
determine
that
dynamite
had
caused
it
and
dug
this
gaping
hole
in
the
stony
soil
bob
west
glanced
at
the
printing
office
which
was
directly
in
line
with
the
explosion
then
he
cast
a
shrewd
look
into
the
white
face
of
thursday
smith
but
the
old
hardware
merchant
merely
muttered
under
his
breath
something
about
ojoy
boglin
and
shook
his
head
determinedly
when
questioned
by
his
fellow
villagers
interest
presently
centered
in
the
damage
that
had
been
done
many
window
panes
were
shattered
and
the
kitchen
chimney
of
the
hotel
had
toppled
over
but
no
person
had
been
injured
and
the
damage
could
easily
be
repaired
while
the
excitement
was
at
its
height
thursday
smith
returned
to
his
room
and
went
to
bed
but
long
after
the
villagers
had
calmed
down
sufficiently
to
seek
their
homes
hetty
hewitt
sat
alone
by
the
great
pit
staring
reflectively
into
its
ragged
depths
quaint
and
curious
were
the
thoughts
that
puzzled
the
solitary
girl
weary
brain
but
prominent
and
was
the
sentence
that
had
trembled
upon
thursday
smith
lips
it
was
a
close
call
the
close
call
did
worry
hetty
a
particle
it
was
the
last
word
of
the
sentence
that
amazed
her
that
and
a
new
and
wonderful
respect
for
the
manliness
of
thursday
smith
filled
her
heart
to
overflowing
chapter
xv
a
clever
idea
neither
thursday
nor
hetty
allowed
a
word
to
escape
concerning
the
placing
of
the
bomb
in
the
office
but
the
explosion
was
public
knowledge
and
many
were
bothering
their
heads
to
explain
its
meaning
john
merrick
when
he
heard
the
news
looked
very
grave
and
glanced
uneasily
into
the
unconscious
faces
of
his
three
beloved
nieces
a
man
of
much
worldly
experience
in
spite
of
his
simple
ingenuous
nature
the
little
man
began
carefully
piecing
together
parts
of
the
puzzle
thursday
smith
defense
of
the
girl
journalists
whereby
he
had
severely
pounded
some
of
the
workmen
who
had
insulted
them
had
caused
the
man
to
be
denounced
by
the
colony
at
royal
skeelty
the
manager
had
demanded
that
smith
be
discharged
by
mirrick
and
being
refused
had
threatened
to
shut
off
the
power
from
the
newspaper
plant
skeelty
dared
not
carry
out
this
threat
for
fear
of
a
lawsuit
but
his
men
who
had
urged
the
matter
of
smith
discharge
upon
their
manager
were
of
the
class
that
seeks
revenge
at
any
cost
at
this
juncture
ojoy
boglin
skeelty
partner
and
the
owner
of
all
the
pine
forest
around
royal
had
become
the
enemy
of
the
newspaper
and
was
aware
of
the
feeling
among
the
workmen
a
word
from
boglin
backed
by
skeelty
tacit
consent
would
induce
the
men
to
go
to
any
length
in
injuring
the
and
all
concerned
in
its
welfare
considering
these
facts
merrick
shrewdly
suspected
that
the
dynamite
explosion
had
been
the
work
of
the
mill
hands
yet
why
it
was
harmlessly
exploded
in
a
field
was
a
factor
that
puzzled
him
exceedingly
he
concluded
from
what
information
he
possessed
that
they
had
merely
intended
this
as
a
warning
which
if
disregarded
might
be
followed
by
a
more
serious
catastrophe
the
idea
that
such
a
danger
threatened
his
nieces
made
the
old
gentleman
distinctly
nervous
there
were
ways
to
evade
further
molestation
from
the
lawless
element
at
the
mill
the
hon
ojoy
could
be
conciliated
thursday
smith
discharged
or
the
girls
could
abandon
their
journalistic
enterprise
altogether
such
alternatives
were
mortifying
to
consider
but
his
girls
must
be
protected
from
harm
at
any
cost
while
he
was
still
considering
the
problem
the
girls
and
arthur
having
driven
to
the
office
as
usual
joe
wegg
rode
over
from
crossing
on
his
sorrel
mare
for
a
chat
with
his
old
friend
and
benefactor
it
was
this
same
young
man
still
a
boy
in
years
who
had
once
owned
the
wegg
farm
and
disposed
of
it
to
merrick
joe
was
something
of
a
mechanical
genius
and
when
his
father
died
longed
to
make
his
way
in
the
great
world
but
after
many
vicissitudes
and
failures
he
returned
to
chazy
county
to
marry
ethel
thompson
his
boyhood
sweetheart
and
to
find
that
one
of
his
father
apparently
foolish
investments
had
made
him
rich
ethel
was
the
of
the
pioneer
settler
of
chazy
county
little
bill
thompson
from
whom
the
little
bill
creek
and
little
bill
mountain
had
been
named
it
was
he
who
first
established
the
mill
at
millville
so
in
marrying
a
descendant
of
little
bill
thompson
joe
wegg
had
become
quite
the
most
important
resident
of
chazy
county
and
the
young
man
was
popular
and
well
liked
by
all
who
knew
him
after
the
first
interchange
of
greetings
joe
questioned
merrick
about
the
explosion
of
the
night
before
and
uncle
john
frankly
stated
his
suspicions
i
sorry
said
joe
they
ever
started
that
mill
at
royal
falls
most
of
the
workmen
are
foreigners
and
all
of
them
rude
and
reckless
they
have
caused
our
quiet
people
no
end
of
trouble
and
anxiety
already
it
is
becoming
a
habit
with
them
to
haunt
millville
on
saturday
nights
when
they
are
partly
intoxicated
and
they
even
invaded
some
of
the
farmhouses
and
frightened
the
women
and
children
i
talked
to
bob
west
about
it
and
he
has
promised
to
swear
in
lon
taft
and
seth
davis
as
special
constables
to
preserve
order
but
he
admits
we
are
quite
helpless
to
oppose
such
a
gang
of
rowdies
i
also
been
to
see
skeelty
to
ask
him
to
keep
his
men
at
home
but
he
answered
gruffly
that
he
had
no
authority
over
his
employees
except
during
working
hours
and
not
much
authority
even
then
skeelty
does
seem
the
right
man
to
handle
those
fellows
observed
merrick
thoughtfully
but
as
he
owns
the
controlling
interest
in
his
company
and
boglin
is
fully
as
unreasonable
we
can
not
possibly
oust
him
from
control
if
the
men
determined
to
blow
up
all
millville
with
dynamite
i
sure
skeelty
would
not
lift
a
finger
to
prevent
it
no
he
deathly
afraid
of
them
and
that
a
fact
said
joe
they
sat
in
silence
a
while
your
report
of
skeelty
threat
to
cut
off
your
electric
power
said
young
wegg
reminds
me
of
a
plan
i
had
in
mind
for
some
time
i
find
i
too
much
time
on
my
hands
merrick
and
i
can
not
be
thoroughly
happy
unless
i
occupied
ethel
farms
are
let
on
shares
and
i
a
drone
in
the
world
busy
hive
but
we
anchored
here
at
millville
so
i
been
wondering
what
i
could
do
to
improve
the
place
and
keep
myself
busy
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
the
same
rush
of
water
in
little
bill
creek
that
runs
the
dynamos
at
royal
is
in
evidence
to
a
lesser
extent
at
the
old
milldam
what
would
you
think
of
my
putting
in
an
electric
plant
at
the
mill
and
lighting
both
millville
and
huntingdon
as
well
as
all
the
farmhouses
not
a
bad
idea
joe
said
uncle
john
approvingly
electric
lights
have
a
civilizing
influence
continued
the
young
man
i
quite
sure
all
the
farmers
between
here
and
huntingdon
would
use
them
at
a
reasonable
price
i
can
also
run
a
line
to
hooker
falls
and
one
to
chazy
junction
plenty
of
poles
can
be
cut
from
our
pine
forests
and
the
wires
will
be
the
chief
expense
i
may
not
make
money
at
first
but
i
play
pretty
nearly
even
and
have
something
to
do
do
you
think
you
could
furnish
enough
power
for
our
printing
office
asked
merrick
yes
and
a
dozen
factories
besides
i
an
idea
the
thing
may
bring
factories
to
millville
then
get
at
it
joe
and
build
it
quick
i
a
notion
we
shall
have
an
open
rupture
with
skeelty
before
long
joe
wegg
smiled
you
going
to
accuse
me
sir
of
asking
advice
after
i
made
up
my
mind
said
he
but
the
fact
is
i
have
bought
the
mill
of
silas
caldwell
already
he
been
wanting
to
dispose
of
the
property
for
some
time
good
exclaimed
uncle
john
also
i
i
ordered
a
dynamo
and
machinery
it
all
ought
to
be
here
in
a
few
days
better
yet
cried
merrick
you
relieved
my
mind
of
a
great
weight
joe
now
about
thursday
smith
said
the
young
man
do
you
think
it
would
be
policy
for
you
to
let
him
go
mr
merrick
no
he
a
clever
fellow
i
can
use
him
at
my
lighting
plant
thank
you
joe
but
that
would
help
any
as
long
as
he
in
millville
he
will
be
an
object
of
vengeance
to
those
anarchistic
mill
hands
the
only
way
to
satisfy
them
in
to
drive
smith
out
of
town
and
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
it
he
has
done
anything
wrong
and
i
interested
in
the
fellow
curious
history
i
put
his
case
in
the
hands
of
a
famous
new
york
detective
fogerty
with
instructions
to
discover
who
he
is
and
i
ca
let
a
lot
of
rowdies
force
me
to
abandon
the
man
for
no
reasonable
cause
do
blame
you
sir
said
joe
if
it
was
this
thursday
smith
some
other
would
incur
the
hatred
of
the
royal
workmen
and
as
disposed
to
terrorize
us
we
may
as
well
fight
it
out
on
this
line
as
any
other
the
whole
county
will
stand
by
you
sir
the
only
thing
i
dread
is
possible
danger
to
my
girls
keep
away
from
the
office
evenings
advised
joe
during
the
day
they
are
perfectly
safe
if
anything
happens
it
will
be
at
night
and
while
the
newspaper
office
may
some
time
go
flying
skyward
the
girls
will
run
no
personal
danger
whatever
maybe
so
joe
how
queer
it
is
that
such
a
condition
should
exist
in
millville
a
little
forgotten
spot
in
the
very
heart
of
civilization
and
the
last
place
where
one
might
expect
excitement
of
this
sort
but
i
wo
be
cowed
i
wo
be
driven
or
bullied
by
a
pack
of
foreign
hounds
i
assure
you
if
skeelty
ca
discipline
his
men
i
will
in
furtherance
of
which
assertion
merrick
went
to
town
and
wired
a
message
to
the
great
fogerty
chapter
xvi
local
contribution
we
hear
considerable
of
the
conventional
people
of
this
world
but
seldom
meet
with
them
for
as
soon
as
we
begin
to
know
a
person
we
discover
peculiarities
that
quite
remove
him
from
the
ranks
of
the
conventional
if
such
ranks
exist
at
all
the
remark
of
the
old
scotch
divine
to
his
good
wife
everybody
queer
but
thee
and
me
nancy
and
sometimes
i
think
a
little
queer
sums
up
human
nature
admirably
we
seldom
recognize
our
own
queerness
but
are
prone
to
mark
the
erratic
temperaments
of
others
and
this
is
rather
more
comfortable
than
to
be
annoyed
by
a
consciousness
of
our
personal
deficits
the
inhabitants
of
a
country
town
are
so
limited
in
their
experiences
that
we
generally
find
their
personal
characteristics
very
amusing
no
amount
of
scholastic
learning
could
have
rendered
the
millville
people
sophisticated
for
contact
with
the
world
and
humanity
is
the
only
true
educator
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
little
scholastic
learning
among
them
with
one
or
two
exceptions
and
the
villagers
as
a
rule
were
of
limited
intelligence
every
one
was
really
a
character
and
uncle
john
nieces
who
all
possessed
a
keen
sense
of
humor
enjoyed
the
oddities
of
the
millvillites
immensely
a
humorous
situation
occurred
through
a
seemingly
innocent
editorial
of
beth
on
authorship
in
the
course
of
her
remarks
she
said
a
prominent
author
is
stated
to
have
accumulated
a
large
fortune
by
writing
short
stories
for
the
newspapers
and
magazines
he
is
said
to
receive
ten
cents
a
word
and
this
unusual
price
is
warranted
by
the
eager
demand
for
his
stories
of
which
the
reading
public
is
very
fond
however
the
unknown
author
does
not
fare
so
badly
the
sum
of
from
thirty
to
fifty
dollars
usually
remitted
for
a
short
story
pays
the
beginner
a
better
recompense
for
the
actual
time
he
is
engaged
upon
the
work
than
any
other
occupation
he
might
undertake
this
was
seriously
considered
the
morning
it
appeared
in

observed
peggy

went
home
to
his
mother
tiny
emporium
took
some
note
paper
out
of
stock
opened
a
new
bottle
of
ink
and
sat
down
at
the
sitting
room
table
to
write
his
story
the

the
widow
sat
down
and
wiped
her
damp
hands
on
her
apron
looking
upon

hopeful
with
an
expression
of
mingled
awe
and
pride

asked
softly

said
after
some
reflection
no

i
thought
o
callin

algernon
detectives
is
allus
suspectin
something
algernon
mused
the
widow
let
it
go
at
that
skim
all
that
day
and
far
into
the
evening
he
sat
at
his
task
pausing
now
and
then
for
inspiration
but
most
of
the
time
diligently
pushing
his
pen
over
the
strongly
lined
note
paper
and
hopelessly
straying
from
the
lines
meantime
clark
walked
around
on
tiptoe
so
as
not
to
disturb
him
and
was
reluctant
even
to
call
him
to
his
meals
in
the
kitchen
when
skim
went
to
bed
his
story
had
got
into
an
aggravating
muddle
but
during
the
next
forenoon
he
managed
to
bring
it
to
a
triumphant
ending
when
i
git
used
to
the
thing
mar
he
said
i
kin
do
one
a
day
easy
i
had
to
be
pertickler
over

bein

the
widow
read
the
story
carefully
guessing
at
the
words
that
were
hopelessly
indistinct
my
but
it
a
thriller
skim
she
said
with
maternal
enthusiasm
but
ye
do
say
why
he
killed
the
girl
that
do

so
long
he
did
it
the

she
added
doubtfully
i
guess
the
spellin
as

he
retorted
with
evident
irritation
i
bet
i

she
asked
as
she
made
a
neat
roll
of
the
manuscript
and
tied
a
pink
hair
ribbon
around
it
skim
put
on
a
collar
and
necktie
and
took
his
story
across
to
the
newspaper
office
i
got
a
fer
the

he
said
to
patsy
who
asked
him

what

she
asked
in
surprise
ye
hit

right
miss
doyle
it
a

oh
a
detective
story
dear
me
then
you
have
to
see
weldon
who
is
our
literary
editor
louise
who
was
sitting
close
by
looked
up
and
held
out
her
hand
for
the
beribboned
roll
i
do
jes
know
remarked
skim
as
he
handed
it
across
the
table
whether
it
a
thirty
dollar
deal
er
a
fifty
having
forgotten
beth
editorial
louise
did
not
understand
this
remark
but
she
calmly
unrolled
skim
manuscript
and
glanced
at
the
scrawled
heading
with
an
amused
smile
algernon
she
read
aloud
were
a
dark
and
teedjus
night
in
the
erly
springtime
while
the
snow
were
falling
soft
over
the
moon
litt
lanskape
why
skim
how
came
you
to
write
this
it
were
the
money
he
said
boldly
i
kin
do
one
a
day
like
this
at
thirty
dollers
apiece
an
never
feel
the
wear
an
tear
patsy
giggled
but
louise
stared
with
a
wondering
puzzled
expression
at
the
crabbed
writing
the
misspelled
words
and
dreadful
grammar
indeed
she
was
a
little
embarrassed
how
to
handle
so
delicate
a
situation
i
afraid
we
can
not
use
your
story
clark
she
said
gently
and
remembering
the
formula
that
usually
accompanied
her
own
rejected
manuscripts
she
added
this
does
not
necessarily
imply
a
lack
of
merit
in
your
contribution
but
is
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
at
present
unavailable
for
our
use
skim
stared
at
her
in
utter
dismay
ye
mean
ye
wo
take
it
he
asked
with
trembling
lips
we
have
so
much
material
on
hand
just
now
that
we
can
not
possibly
purchase
more
she
said
firmly
but
feeling
intensely
sorry
for
the
boy
it
may
be
a
good
story
it
the
bes
story
i
ever
heard
of
declared
skim
but
we
have
no
place
for
it
in
the
tribune
she
added
handing
him
back
the
roll
skim
was
terribly
disappointed
never
for
a
single
moment
had
he
expected
sech
a
throwdown
as
this
seems
to
me
like
a
bunco
game
he
muttered
savagely
first
ye
say
in
yer
blamed
ol
paper
a
story
wuth
thirty
to
fifty
dollars
an
then
when
i
bring
ye
a
story
ye
wo
pay
a
red
cent
fer
it
stories
suggested
louise
are
of
various
qualities
depending
on
the
experience
and
talent
of
the
author
an
excellent
story
is
often
refused
because
the
periodical
to
which
it
is
offered
is
overstocked
with
similar
material
such
conditions
are
often
trying
skim
i
had
a
good
many
manuscripts
rejected
myself
but
the
boy
would
not
be
conciliated
i
send
it
to
munsey
thet
what
i
do
an
then
you
be
durn
sorry
he
said
almost
ready
to
cry
do
urged
louise
sweetly
and
if
they
print
it
clark
i
agree
to
purchase
your
next
story
for
fifty
dollars
all
right
the
fifty
mine
i
got
witnesses
mind
ye
and
he
flounced
out
of
the
room
like
an
angry
schoolboy
oh
louise
exclaimed
patsy
reproachfully
why
did
you
let
me
see
the
thing
it
would
have
been
better
than
a
circus
poor
boy
said
the
literary
editor
with
a
sigh
i
did
want
to
humiliate
him
more
than
i
could
help
i
wonder
if
he
really
will
have
the
audacity
to
send
it
to
munsey
and
now
the
door
opened
to
admit
peggy
mcnutt
who
had
been
watching
his
chance
to
stump
across
to
the
printing
office
as
soon
as
skim
left
there
for
peggy
had
reasoned
not
unjustly
that
if
skim
clark
could
make
a
fortune
as
an
author
he
marshall
mcmahon
mcnutt
had
a
show
to
corral
a
few
dollars
in
literature
himself
after
lying
awake
half
the
night
thinking
it
over
he
arose
this
morning
with
the
firm
intention
of
competing
with
skim
for
the
village
laurels
he
well
knew
he
could
not
write
a
shuddery
detective
story
such
as
skim
had
outlined
but
that
early
poem
of
his
which
the
boy
had
seemed
to
regard
so
disdainfully
was
considered
by
peggy
a
rather
clever
production
he
repeated
it
over
and
over
to
himself
dwelling
joyously
on
its
perfect
rhyme
until
he
was
convinced
it
was
a
good
poem
and
that
skim
had
enviously
slandered
it
so
he
wrote
it
out
in
big
letters
on
a
sheet
of
foolscap
and
determined
to
offer
it
to
them
newspaper
gals
i
got
a
pome
miss
patsy
he
said
with
unusual
diffidence
for
he
was
by
no
means
sure
the
gals
would
not
agree
with
skim
criticism
what
another
contributor
she
exclaimed
playfully
has
the
whole
town
suddenly
turned
literary
peggy
no
jest
me
skim
skim
says
my
pome
no
good
but
i
sort
o
like
it
myself
let
me
see
it
said
patsy
ignoring
this
time
the
literary
editor
who
was
glad
to
be
relieved
of
the
responsibility
of
disappointing
another
budding
author
peggy
handed
over
the
foolscap
and
patsy
eagerly
read
the
pome
listen
louise
listen
beth
she
called
delightedly
here
is
certainly
a
real

so
i
cry
a
sad
goodby
too
ing
a
chorus
of
hilarious
laughter
followed
the
reading
and
then
patsy
wiped
her
eyes
and
exclaimed
peggy
you
are
not
only
a
poet
but
a
humorist
this
is
one
of
the
best
short
poems
i
ever

run

peggy
but

a
gem
what
there

peggy
uncertainly
whether

inquired
anxiously

advertisement
and
all
she
did
and
peggy
bought
two
extra
copies
at
a
cent
apiece
he
framed
all
three
and
hung
one
in
his
office
one
in
the
sitting
room
and
a
third
in
his
bedroom
where
he
could
see
it
the
first
thing
when
he
wakened
each
morning
his
fellow
villagers
were
very
proud
of
him
in
spite
of
the
knocking
of
the
clarks
skim
was
deeply
mortified
that
peggy
bum
pome
had
been
accepted
and
his
own
masterly
composition
turned
down
cold
the
widow
backed
her
son
and
told

chapter

the
penalties
of
journalism
two
strange
men
appeared
in
millville
keen
intelligent
looking
fellows
and
applied
to
joe
wegg
for
jobs
having
received
a
hint
from
merrick
joe
promptly
employed
the
strangers
to
prepare
the
old
mill
for
the
reception
of
the
machinery
for
the
lighting
plant
and
both
of
them
engaged
board
at
the
hold
thursday
said
hetty
as
she
watched
the
pressman
that
night
a
new
york
detective
here
two
of
them
i
think
how
do
you
know
i
recognized
one
of
them
who
used
to
prowl
around
the
city
looking
for
suspicious
characters
they
say
they
come
to
work
on
the
new
electric
plant
but
i
do
believe
it
thursday
worked
a
while
in
silence
merrick
must
have
sent
for
them
he
suggested
yes
i
think
he
suspects
about
the
bomb
he
ought
to
discharge
me
said
thursday
no
he
man
enough
to
stand
by
his
guns
i
like
merrick
he
become
a
millionaire
without
having
cleverness
to
back
him
and
i
imagine
he
is
clever
enough
to
thwart
skeelty
and
all
his
gang
perhaps
i
ought
to
go
of
my
own
accord
said
thursday
do
do
that
when
you
found
a
friend
like
merrick
stick
to
him
i
imagine
those
detectives
are
here
to
protect
you
as
well
as
the
printing
plant
it
wo
be
so
easy
to
set
a
bomb
the
next
time
smith
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
there
was
a
glint
of
admiration
in
his
eyes
you
not
a
bad
sleuth
yourself
hetty
he
remarked
no
detective
could
have
acted
more
wisely
and
promptly
than
you
did
that
night
it
was
an
accidental
discovery
thursday
sometimes
i
sleep
that
was
a
good
deal
of
conversation
for
these
two
to
indulge
in
hetty
was
talkative
enough
at
times
and
so
was
thursday
smith
when
the
humor
seized
him
but
when
they
were
together
they
said
very
little
the
artist
would
stroll
into
the
pressroom
after
the
compositors
had
finished
their
tasks
and
watch
the
man
make
up
the
forms
lock
them
place
them
on
the
press
and
run
off
the
edition
then
he
would
glance
over
the
paper
while
thursday
washed
up
and
put
on
his
coat
after
which
he
accompanied
her
to
the
door
of
her
hotel
and
with
a
simple
good
night
proceeded
up
the
street
to
his
own
lodging
there
are
surprises
in
the
newspaper
business
as
our
girl
journalists
were
fast
discovering
it
was
a
real
calamity
when
miss
briggs
who
had
been
primarily
responsible
for
getting
the
daily
into
proper
working
order
suddenly
resigned
her
position
they
had
depended
a
great
deal
on
miss
briggs
so
when
the
telegraph
editor
informed
them
she
was
going
back
to
new
york
they
were
positively
bewildered
by
her
loss
questions
elicited
the
fact
that
the
woman
was
nervous
over
the
recent
explosion
and
looked
for
further
trouble
from
the
mill
hands
she
also
suspected
the
two
recent
arrivals
to
be
detectives
and
the
town
was
so
small
and
so
absolutely
without
police
protection
that
she
would
not
risk
her
personal
safety
by
remaining
longer
in
it
perhaps
i
homesick
she
added
it
dreadfully
lonely
here
when
not
at
work
and
for
that
reason
i
tried
to
keep
busy
most
of
the
time
really
i
astonished
to
think
i
stood
this
isolation
so
long
but
now
that
my
mind
is
made
up
i
going
and
it
is
useless
to
ask
me
to
remain
they
offered
her
higher
wages
and
merrick
himself
had
a
long
talk
with
her
but
all
arguments
were
unavailing
what
shall
we
do
thursday
asked
patsy
in
despair
none
of
us
understands
telegraphy
hetty
hewitt
does
he
suggested
hetty
i
afraid
if
i
asked
her
to
assume
this
work
she
also
would
leave
us
no
she
stay
he
said
positively
but
she
ca
edit
the
telegraph
news
suppose
she
took
the
messages
who
would
get
the
night
news
in
shape
for
the
compositors
my
uncle
would
not
like
to
have
me
remain
here
until
midnight
but
even
if
he
would
permit
it
i
have
not
yet
mastered
the
art
of
condensing
the
dispatches
and
selecting
just
such
items
as
are
suitable
for
the
i
do
that
miss
doyle
promised
smith
i
been
paying
especial
attention
to
the
work
of
miss
briggs
for
i
had
an
idea
she
was
getting
uneasy
and
i
can
take
all
the
day
messages
too
if
hetty
will
look
after
the
wires
evenings
i
can
do
the
rest
of
the
telegraph
editor
work
and
my
own
too
good
gracious
thursday
exclaimed
patsy
you
be
running
the
whole
paper
presently
no
i
ca
do
the
typesetting
but
if
the
dwyer
girls
stick
to
their
job
and
they
seem
quite
contented
here
i
answer
for
the
rest
of
the
outfit
i
glad
the
dwyer
girls
seem
contented
she
answered
but
afraid
to
depend
upon
anyone
now
except
you
he
liked
that
compliment
but
said
nothing
further
after
consulting
with
louise
and
beth
patsy
broached
the
subject
to
hetty
and
the
artist
jumped
at
the
opportunity
to
do
something
to
occupy
her
leisure
time
the
work
brought
her
in
contact
with
thursday
smith
more
than
ever
and
when
miss
briggs
departed
bag
and
baggage
for
new
york
the
paper
suffered
little
through
her
defection
newspaper
folk
remarked
major
doyle
who
was
now
at
the
farm
enjoying
his
vacation
and
worshipping
at
the
shrine
of
the
managing
editor
in
the
person
of
his
versatile
daughter
are
the
most
unreliable
of
any
class
in
the
world
so
i
often
been
told
and
i
believe
it
they
come
and
go
by
fits
and
starts
and
it
a
wonder
the
erratic
rascals
never
put
a
paper
out
of
business
but
they
do
you
never
heard
of
a
newspaper
that
failed
to
appear
just
because
the
mechanical
force
deserted
and
left
it
in
the
lurch
by
hook
or
crook
the
paper
must
be
printed
and
it
always
is
so
do
worry
mavourneen
when
your
artist
and
your
hobo
desert
you
there
still
be
a
way
to
keep
the
going
and
therefore
the
world
will
continue
to
whirl
on
its
axis
i
do
believe
thursday
will
ever
desert
and
hetty
likes
us
too
well
to
leave
us
in
the
lurch
but
suppose
those
typesetters
take
a
notion
to
flit
then
said
beth
we
fill
the
paper
with
plate
stuff
and
telegraph
for
more
compositors
that
it
agreed
the
major
those
people
are
always
to
be
had
but
do
worry
till
the
time
comes
as
me
grandfather
the
commodore
once
said
cross
a
bridge
till
ye
come
to
it
it
was
your
grandfather
who
originated
that
remark
said
uncle
john
it
was
sir
i
defy
you
to
prove
otherwise
i
not
certain
you
ever
had
a
grandfather
and
he
was
a
commodore
anyhow
sir
cried
the
major
glaring
at
his
i
have
his
commission
somewhere
laid
away
never
mind
said
patsy
cheerfully
for
these
fierce
arguments
between
her
father
and
uncle
who
were
devotedly
attached
to
one
another
never
disturbed
her
in
the
least
the
running
smoothly
just
now
and
the
work
is
keeping
us
delightfully
busy
i
think
that
never
in
my
life
have
i
enjoyed
myself
more
than
since
i
became
a
journalist
is
the
thing
paying
dividends
inquired
the
major
arthur
laughed
i
just
been
figuring
up
the
last
month
expenditures
and
receipts
said
he
the
first
month
did
count
for
we
were
getting
started
and
what
the
result
asked
the
major
every
paper
we
send
out
for
one
cent
costs
us
cents
to
manufacture
there
was
a
painful
silence
for
a
time
broken
by
the
major
suggestive
cough
i
hope
said
the
old
soldier
solemnly
that
the
paper
circulation
is
very
small
the
smallest
of
any
daily
paper
in
all
the
civilized
word
sir
declared
the
bookkeeper
of
course
remarked
louise
with
dignity
that
is
what
distinguishes
it
we
did
not
undertake
this
publication
to
make
money
and
it
does
not
cost
us
more
than
we
are
willing
to
pay
for
the
exceptional
experiences
we
are
gaining
the
major
raised
his
eyebrows
arthur
whistled
softly
uncle
john
smiled
but
with
one
accord
they
dropped
the
disagreeable
subject
chapter

open
warfare
joe
wegg
machinery
and
dynamos
arrived
promptly
and
the
electric
plant
was
speedily
installed
at
the
old
mill
so
energetically
had
the
young
man
supervised
his
work
that
poles
and
wires
were
all
in
place
as
far
up
the
road
as
thompson
crossing
and
a
branch
line
run
to
the
wegg
farm
by
the
time
the
first
test
was
made
all
millville
celebrated
that
first
night
when
its
streets
shone
resplendent
under
the
glare
of
electric
lights
there
was
a
public
bonfire
near
the
mill
speeches
were
made
and
afterward
merrick
served
a
free
supper
to
the
villagers
in
the
hall
over
sam
general
store
where
the
girls
assisted
in
waiting
upon
the
guests
and
everybody
was
happy
and
as
hilarious
as
the
fumes
of
good
coffee
could
make
them
more
speeches
were
made
in
the
hall
and
one
of
these
was
by
peggy
mcnutt
who
had
painted
his
wooden
foot
blue
with
red
stripes
in
honor
of
the
occasion
he
said

is
no
plaything
it
is
going
to
give
you
all
better
light
at
no
more
cost
to
you
than
kerosene
but
it
will
do
more
than
that
it
will
run

than
steam

so
you

we
are
about
to
arouse
from
our
long

and
have
a

another
item

bartlett
has
sold
sixty
acres

to

for
many
years
a
prominent
physician
of
boston
who
is
going
to
build
a
good
house
on

land
and
become
a
citizen
of
millville
we
always
had
to
go
to
huntingdon
for
a
doctor
but
now
matthews
has
promised
to
look
after
the
health
of
the
millville
people
although
he
has
retired
from

great
applause
a
general
discussion
followed
concerning
the
doin
of
joe
wegg
and
the
prophecies
he
had
made
opinion
seemed
divided
as
to
whether
the
promised
boom
was
desirable
for
millville
or
not
some
of
the
good
villagers
were
averse
to
personal
activity
and
feared
the
new
order
of
things
might
disturb
their
comfort
in
others
a
mild
ambition
had
been
awakened
but
while
they
feasted
at
merrick
expense
and
gravely
canvassed
the
situation
the
newly
installed
electric
lights
suddenly
failed
darkness
fell
upon
the
assemblage
and
there
was
an
awed
hush
until
sam
cotting
lighted
the
old
reliable
kerosene
lamps
joe
wegg
was
as
much
astonished
as
anyone
there
has
been
an
accident
to
the
machinery
he
said
to
merrick
i
run
over
to
the
mill
and
see
what
has
happened
i
will
go
with
you
said
arthur
weldon
and
major
doyle
also
decided
to
accompany
the
young
man
uncle
john
and
his
three
nieces
remained
in
the
hall
and
merrick
took
occasion
to
make
a
little
speech
in
which
he
explained
that
a
hitch
in
the
working
of
the
electric
plant
was
liable
to
happen
at
first
but
after
a
few
days
the
dynamos
could
be
fully
depended
upon
he
had
scarcely
finished
this
explanation
when
arthur
came
running
back
into
the
hall
in
much
excitement
he
approached
merrick
and
said
in
a
low
voice
the
machinery
is
all
right
sir
some
one
has
cut
the
wires
cut
the
wires
yes
joe
thinks
it
the
work
of
the
mill
hands
the
wires
are
cut
in
all
directions
and
several
of
the
men
from
royal
have
been
seen
loitering
around
by
cox
and
booth
the
detectives
the
girls
overheard
this
assertion
and
patsy
exclaimed
i
going
to
the
office
to
make
sure
our
power
has
been
tampered
with
the
meeting
broke
up
at
once
and
the
villagers
trooped
out
to
investigate
merrick
and
arthur
walked
with
the
girls
to
the
printing
office
where
they
found
thursday
smith
and
hetty
working
by
the
light
of
tallow
candles
the
power
is
off
said
smith
quietly
then
the
wire
from
royal
has
also
been
cut
said
patsy
what
shall
we
do
his
paper
must
come
out
morning
in
spite
of
anything
and
everything
do
you
know
who
cut
the
wires
inquired
thursday
we
think
the
mill
hands
must
have
done
it
not
with
skeelty
consent
i
be
bound
said
merrick
the
manager
is
too
fearful
of
a
damage
suit
to
play
any
tricks
a
cut
wire
may
be
repaired
suggested
the
pressman
and
even
as
he
spoke
joe
wegg
came
in
accompanied
by
the
two
detectives
and
the
major
cox
has
interviewed
one
of
the
workmen
from
royal
said
joe
and
the
fellow
says
there
a
strike
at
the
mill
and
everything
is
closed
down
skeelty
is
barricaded
in
his
office
building
wild
with
fear
for
the
men
have
captured
the
company
store
and
helped
themselves
to
the
stock
of
liquors
the
man
cox
spoke
with
who
seems
to
be
a
well
disposed
fellow
predicts
all
kinds
of
trouble
and
perhaps
rioting
before
this
thing
is
ended
they
listened
to
this
report
in
amazement
i
conjecture
said
the
major
that
the
rascally
manager
has
given
his
men
too
much
leeway
he
encouraged
them
in
mischief
until
taken
the
bit
between
their
teeth
and
turned
against
even
their
master
i
have
no
personal
acquaintance
with
the
villain
but
i
imagine
it
serves
him
right
but
dear
me
cried
patsy
wringing
her
hands
what
become
of
the
paper
it
nearly
ten
now
thursday
turned
to
joe
wegg
ca
we
connect
our
supply
wire
with
your
new
plant
so
as
to
use
your
power
he
asked
easily
an
hour
work
will
serve
to
make
the
connection
but
unless
we
watch
the
wire
every
minute
those
fellows
will
cut
it
again
the
full
of
the
rascals
and
they
not
exactly
sober
either
watch
the
wire
that

idea

uncle
john

a
short
distance

the
mill

sure

villagers

volunteer
for
this
duty
of
course
said
joe
major
doyle

you
mount
guard
over
my
men
at
the
dynamos
to
see
they
not
interfered
with
while
i
look
after
the
wire
sure
enough
it
remind
me
of
the
old
war
times
said
the
major
readily
where
is
arthur
asked
louise
we
left
him
at
the
mill
they
left
the
office
at
once
joe
to
get
his
at
work
and
the
major
to
join
weldon
in
guarding
the
dynamos
one
of
the
detectives
went
with
wegg
but
the
other
whose
name
was
booth
remained
to
guard
the
printing
office
merrick
now
proposed
that
he
take
the
girls
home
patsy
and
beth
refused
to
leave
until
the
emergency
was
past
when
the
major
and
arthur
could
drive
them
to
the
farm
but
louise
was
tired
and
went
with
uncle
john
in
his
buggy
the
surrey
being
left
for
the
rest
of
the
party
to
use
arthur
ran
over
for
a
moment
to
say
everything
was
quiet
at
the
mill
and
he
did
not
think
there
would
be
any
further
trouble
and
the
report
considerably
reassured
them
chapter
xix
a
mere
matter
of
revenge
hetty
and
thursday
continued
to
work
on
the
paper
we
have
everything
ready
by
the
time
the
line
is
connected
said
the
artist
then
it
will
be
but
a
few
moments
work
to
run
off
the
edition
patsy
and
beth
held
candles
for
them
for
the
electric
lights
had
been
cut
off
with
the
power
so
seeing
them
all
busily
engaged
arthur
weldon
decided
to
return
to
the
mill
to
join
the
major
booth
sat
in
the
front
office
near
the
door
and
in
the
darkness
arthur
nearly
stumbled
over
him
going
away
sir
asked
the
man
yes
i
see
if
i
can
be
of
any
assistance
at
the
mill
be
careful
those
workmen
have
been
drifting
into
town
in
squads
the
last
few
minutes
and
most
of
them
are
reckless
with
drink
i
watch
out
said
arthur
in
the
middle
of
the
road
a
group
of
mill
hands
conversed
excitedly
in
some
foreign
tongue
but
they
paid
no
attention
to
weldon
as
he
passed
them
others
joined
them
presently
and
one
began
a
harangue
in
a
loud
voice
to
which
they
listened
eagerly
then
bob
west
slipped
across
from
the
hardware
store
and
ran
against
the
detective
in
the
doorway
of
the
printing
office
who
this
he
demanded
holding
the
man
in
a
firm
grip
booth
sir
good
i
could
not
recognize
you
in
this
darkness
are
you
armed
yes
then
you
and
i
will
defend
this
door
who
is
inside
the
pressman
thursday
smith
and
three
of
the
girls
the
compositors
no
they
gone
to
the
hotel
miss
doyle
miss
degraf
and
hetty
hewitt
west
went
into
the
hack
room
which
was
faintly
illumined
by
candles
stuck
here
and
there
the
girls
and
smith
were
all
bending
over
the
imposing
stone
where
the
forms
of
the
paper
were
being
made
up
here
said
west
taking
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
and
laying
it
on
the
table
i
afraid
there
may
be
an
attack
on
this
office
in
a
few
minutes
for
i
understand
the
language
of
those
strikers
and
have
been
listening
to
them
if
any
of
the
mill
hands
attempt
to
break
into
this
room
do
be
afraid
to
shoot
why
should
the
men
wish
to
attack
us
sir
asked
patsy
wonderingly
there
are
several
reasons
they
after
smith
for
one
thing
an
old
grudge
against
him
to
settle
aside
from
the
mere
matter
of
revenge
i
overheard
one
of
them
telling
his
friends
to
smash
the
press
and
keep
the
paper
from
coming
out
and
boglin
would
pay
them
well
for
the
job
smith
carelessly
thrust
the
revolver
into
his
hip
pocket
the
paper
will
come
out
if
wegg
gives
us
the
power
he
said
can
you
let
me
have
a
revolver
mr
west
asked
hetty
could
you
use
it
i
think
so
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
then
took
a
second
revolver
from
his
pocket
i
robbed
my
hardware
stock
he
said
with
a
smile
but
i
advise
you
girls
to
keep
your
hands
off
the
thing
unless
a
crisis
arises
i
imagine
the
gang
will
get
past
me
and
booth
at
the
entrance
but
if
any
stragglers
come
your
way
smith
has
authority
to
drive
them
back
justice
of
the
peace
and
i
hereby
appoint
you
all
special
officers
of
the
law
he
said
this
lightly
fearing
to
alarm
the
girls
unnecessarily
and
then
passed
through
the
doorway
and
joined
booth
at
the
front
the
telephone
rang
and
patsy
answered
it
how
soon
will
the
forms
be
ready
asked
arthur
voice
in
ten
minutes
perhaps
five
she
answered
we
have
the
power
on
in
ten
minutes
more
tell
smith
not
to
lose
an
instant
time
in
running
off
the
edition
for
we
do
know
how
long
we
can
keep
the
line
open
the
strikers
are
threatening
us
even
now
all
right
called
patsy
just
give
us
the
power
for
a
few
minutes
and
we
be
through
for
she
went
back
to
thursday
and
reported
there
may
be
a
few
typographical
errors
and
i
afraid
it
a
bad
he
remarked
but
i
have
the
thing
on
the
press
in
five
minutes
with
mallet
and
he
tightened
the
quoins
then
lifted
the
heavy
iron
frames
filled
with
type
and
slid
them
onto
the
bed
of
the
press
they
gave
him
all
the
light
the
flickering
candles
afforded
as
he
adjusted
the
machinery
and
all
were
bending
over
the
press
when
a
low
distant
growl
was
heard
rising
slowly
to
a
frenzied
shout
a
revolver
popped
another
followed
by
wild
cries
from
the
street
the
girls
grew
a
little
pale
but
thursday
smith
put
his
hand
on
the
lever
of
the
press
and
said
all
right
the
moment
they
give
us
the
current
we
ready
to
run
patsy
straightened
up
with
a
sigh
of
relief
then
gave
a
low
cry
as
the
screens
of
the
two
windows
of
the
pressroom
were
smashed
in
and
through
the
openings
men
began
to
tumble
into
the
room
at
once
hetty
confronted
them
with
leveled
revolver
and
the
sight
caused
them
to
hesitate
out
o
the
way
you
women
called
a
burly
fellow
who
wore
a
green
sweater
and
an
oilskin
hat
we
do
want
to
hurt
you
if
we
can
help
there
the
one
we
after
he
pointed
a
finger
at
thursday
smith
you
ca
have
him
retorted
beth
half
shielded
behind
the
militant
hetty
this
is
private
property
and
you
trespassing
unless
you
go
away
at
once
you
will
suffer
the
consequences
this
defense
seemed
to
surprise
them
for
they
fell
back
a
little
toward
the
windows
at
that
moment
with
a
low
rumble
the
press
started
moving
slowly
at
first
but
gradually
acquiring
speed
the
sight
aroused
the
resentment
of
the
invaders
stop
that
press
yelled
their
spokesman
excitedly
stop
it
smith
or
we
put
both
you
and
the
machine
out
of
business
thursday
paid
no
attention
to
anything
but
his
press
the
huge
cylinder
of
white
paper
was
unrolling
passing
under
the
platen
and
emerging
at
the
other
end
as
neatly
folded
copies
of
the
millville
daily
tribune
with
a
roar
of
rage
the
big
fellow
leaped
forward
but
at
the
action
a
shot
rang
out
and
he
fell
headlong
almost
at
the
foot
of
the
press
beth
and
patsy
turned
their
heads
an
instant
to
glance
at
hetty
the
artist
face
was
white
and
set
her
eyes
sparkled
brilliantly
she
held
the
still
smoking
weapon
in
readiness
for
another
shot
but
the
men
were
awed
by
the
fall
of
their
leader
they
watched
beth
leap
to
the
platform
beside
thursday
smith
and
draw
his
revolver
from
his
pocket
where
he
had
placed
it
hetty
courage
had
inspired
her
and
beth
had
handled
pistols
before
the
men
read
the
determined
eyes
fixed
upon
them
they
noted
smith
indifference
to
their
threats
the
defenders
of
the
press
and
pressman
were
only
girls
but
they
were
girls
evidently
not
afraid
to
shoot
no
advance
was
made
and
the
tableau
was
dramatic
smith
watched
his
press
with
undivided
attention
and
it
clattered
away
at
full
speed
until
the
frail
building
shook
with
its
powerful
steady
motion
then
suddenly
it
began
to
slow
down
the
power
was
off
and
the
machine
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
thursday
stepped
from
the
platform
and
looked
at
the
index
of
the
counter
four
hundred
and
short
miss
doyle
he
announced
that
do
thursday
he
came
to
her
side
then
facing
the
sullen
glowering
group
of
mill
hands
boys
said
he
it
wo
do
you
any
good
to
interfere
with
us
the
paper
for
morning
is
already
printed
and
ojoy
boglin
is
a
big
enough
man
to
stop
it
now
or
ever
better
go
back
to
royal
and
settle
your
troubles
with
skeelty
for
if
you
stay
here
the
citizens
of
millville
are
in
the
mood
to
shoot
you
down
like
dogs
they
stood
undecided
a
moment
but
the
argument
had
evidently
struck
home
what
the
matter
with
harris
asked
one
pointing
to
the
motionless
form
of
the
man
in
the
green
sweater
is
he
dead
i
suppose
so
answered
thursday
coolly
but
he
stooped
to
examine
hetty
victim
rolling
him
over
so
that
his
face
was
upward
no
he
is
hurt
much
i
sorry
to
say
the
bullet
glanced
off
his
forehead
and
stunned
him
that
all
take
the
brute
if
you
want
him
and
go
they
obeyed
in
silence
several
stepped
forward
and
raised
the
unconscious
harris
bearing
him
to
the
window
where
they
passed
him
to
those
without
then
they
also
retreated
through
the
windows
and
the
room
was
cleared
only
then
did
hetty
and
beth
venture
to
lower
their
weapons
oh
dear
cried
patsy
in
a
low
agitated
voice
i
so
glad
you
did
kill
him
hetty
i
not
returned
the
artist
doggedly
he
deserved
death
at
the
least
and
by
killing
him
i
have
cheated
the
gallows
then
she
glanced
around
at
the
horrified
faces
of
her
friends
and
burst
into
tears
chapter
xx
defending
the
press
in
the
front
room
bob
west
and
the
detective
were
having
a
busy
time
at
the
first
rush
they
each
fired
a
shot
over
the
heads
of
the
mob
merely
to
let
them
know
the
place
was
guarded
in
the
darkness
it
was
impossible
for
the
strikers
to
tell
how
many
armed
men
confronted
them
so
they
fell
back
a
little
but
formed
a
cordon
around
the
entire
building
from
the
printing
office
to
the
old
mill
was
a
distance
of
only
a
few
hundred
feet
and
every
inhabitant
of
millville
except
peggy
mcnutt
and
sara
cotting
who
had
discreetly
disappeared
at
the
first
sign
of
danger
was
assisting
joe
wegg
to
protect
the
electric
cable
he
was
trying
to
connect
the
men
from
royal
were
scattered
all
along
the
line
peering
through
the
dim
light
to
discover
a
vulnerable
point
of
attack
but
deterred
from
interfering
by
the
determination
of
the
stalwart
defenders
mobs
are
invariably
cowardly
and
this
one
composed
of
the
lowest
strata
of
mixed
american
and
foreign
laborers
was
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
however
when
word
was
finally
passed
along
from
the
mill
that
the
dynamo
was
running
and
supplying
power
to
the
printing
press
a
howl
of
rage
went
up
and
a
sudden
rush
was
made
for
the
line
the
attack
concentrating
at
one
point
the
defenders
promptly
grouped
themselves
in
front
of
the
threatened
pole
and
seth
davis
the
blacksmith
wielding
a
heavy
sledge
hammer
did
valiant
service
clearing
a
space
around
him
with
little
difficulty
joe
wegg
arthur
weldon
cox
the
detective
lon
taft
nick
thome
and
even
little
skim
clark
were
all
in
the
melee
fighting
desperately
for
time
to
enable
thursday
smith
to
work
his
press
using
whatever
cudgels
they
had
been
able
to
pick
up
to
keep
the
assailants
from
the
pole
slowly
however
they
were
forced
back
by
superior
numbers
until
finally
one
of
the
mill
hands
clambered
up
the
pole
and
cut
the
wire
never
mind
said
arthur
to
joe
as
they
retreated
fighting
toward
the
printing
office
i
think
they
had
time
to
run
off
the
edition
provided
smith
was
ready
with
the
forms
the
mob
was
by
this
time
in
an
ugly
mood
and
the
nearer
joe
and
arthur
edged
toward
the
printing
office
the
more
numerous
their
enemies
became
the
millville
people
were
getting
rather
the
worst
of
the
scrimmage
when
out
rushed
thursday
smith
swinging
a
stout
iron
bar
he
had
taken
from
the
press
and
with
this
terrible
weapon
he
struck
out
so
vigorously
that
the
diversion
in
their
favor
enabled
the
retreating
villagers
to
gain
the
office
where
booth
and
bob
west
fired
several
shots
that
effectually
checked
the
mob
stand
back
ye
villains
cried
a
loud
voice
as
major
doyle
marched
calmly
down
the
road
from
the
mill
how
dare
ye
interfere
with
a
gentleman
one
of
the
leaders
confronted
him
menacingly
the
major
slapped
his
face
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
and
then
kicked
the
fellow
in
the
shins
did
i
say
to
get
out
o
my
way
he
roared
and
to
the
surprise
of
everyone
even
the
major
perhaps
they
fell
hack
and
allowed
him
to
walk
leisurely
into
the
printing
office
having
succeeded
in
their
primary
attempt
to
cut
the
wire
and
finding
the
determined
band
of
defenders
more
dangerous
than
they
had
thought
the
workmen
retreated
in
the
direction
of
royal
where
there
was
more
to
be
gained
by
rioting
than
in
millville
when
at
last
the
town
was
clear
of
them
arthur
who
was
considerably
battered
and
bruised
but
pleased
with
the
triumphant
ending
of
the
adventure
drove
the
girls
and
the
major
to
the
farm
they
urged
hetty
to
accompany
them
but
she
declared
she
was
not
a
bit
nervous
and
preferred
to
sleep
at
the
hotel
i
think
the
trouble
is
over
for
said
west
and
all
agreed
with
him
cox
and
booth
decided
to
sleep
in
the
printing
office
and
after
the
girls
had
driven
away
with
their
escorts
and
the
villagers
had
dispersed
to
their
homes
thursday
put
on
his
coat
and
walked
to
the
hotel
with
hetty
all
that
row
was
about
me
he
remarked
disconsolately
but
they
did
get
you
said
hetty
triumph
in
her
voice
no
he
did
not
mention
her
bravery
or
the
loyal
support
of
beth
and
patsy
but
after
a
moment
he
added
i
not
worth
defending
how
do
you
know
asked
hetty
it
occurs
to
me
smith
that
you
are
as
much
a
stranger
to
yourself
as
to
us
that
is
true
and
in
emergencies
you
are
not
averse
to
defending
others
of
course
miss
degraf
and
her
cousin
wanted
the
paper
printed
at
all
hazards
i
do
blame
them
for
that
but
i
she
hesitated
you
simply
stood
by
a
comrade
thank
you
hetty
good
night
thursday
will
you
be
able
to
sleep
i
going
straight
to
bed
the
rumpus
has
quieted
my
nerves
good
night
then
in
the
early
morning
merrick
was
awakened
by
a
red
glare
that
flooded
his
bedroom
going
to
the
window
he
found
the
sky
at
the
north
full
of
flame
he
threw
on
his
bathrobe
and
went
to
the
door
of
arthur
weldon
room
arousing
the
young
man
with
a
rap
on
the
panels
the
settlement
at
royal
is
burning
he
reported
arthur
came
out
very
weary
and
drowsy
for
he
had
not
been
asleep
long
and
the
strenuous
work
of
the
night
had
tired
him
let
it
burn
he
said
glancing
through
a
window
at
the
lurid
light
of
the
conflagration
we
could
be
of
any
use
going
over
there
and
after
all
it
is
our
affair
to
relieve
skeelty
then
he
told
uncle
john
of
the
riot
in
the
village
for
the
old
gentleman
had
been
sound
asleep
when
the
party
returned
to
the
farm
the
blaze
is
the
work
of
those
crazy
strikers
i
suppose
said
merrick
it
looks
from
here
as
if
they
had
set
fire
to
their
own
homes
as
well
as
to
the
paper
mills
and
office
and
store
buildings
it
will
be
fortunate
if
the
forest
does
not
also
burn
do
worry
sir
advised
arthur
we
discover
the
extent
of
the
fire
by
daylight
for
my
part
i
going
back
to
bed
and
it
will
be
well
for
you
to
follow
my
example
another
item
for
the
paper
whispered
a
soft
voice
and
there
was
patsy
beside
them
at
the
window
merrick
sighed
i
had
no
idea
so
much
excitement
could
possibly
happen
at
millville
said
he
if
this
keeps
on
we
have
to
go
back
to
new
york
for
quiet
but
let
us
get
to
bed
my
dear
for
is
likely
to
be
a
busy
day
for
us
all
chapter
xxi
the
coming
of
fogerty
the
homeless
mill
hands
flocked
to
chazy
junction
next
day
from
whence
a
freight
train
distributed
them
over
other
parts
of
the
country
the
clearing
at
royal
falls
was
now
a
heap
of
charred
embers
for
every
one
of
the
cheap
buildings
had
been
consumed
by
the
fire
skeelty
had
watched
the
destruction
of
his
plant
with
feelings
of
mingled
glee
and
disgust
he
was
insured
against
loss
and
his
rash
workmen
who
had
turned
upon
him
so
unexpectedly
had
accidentally
settled
the
strike
and
their
own
future
by
starting
the
fire
during
their
drunken
orgies
there
being
no
longer
a
mill
to
employ
them
they
went
elsewhere
for
work
rather
glad
of
the
change
and
regretting
nothing
as
for
the
manager
he
stood
to
lose
temporary
profits
but
was
not
wholly
displeased
by
the
catastrophe
transportation
of
his
manufactured
products
had
been
so
irregular
and
undefendable
that
even
while
he
watched
the
blaze
he
determined
to
rebuild
his
plant
nearer
the
main
line
of
a
railway
for
many
such
locations
could
be
found
where
the
pine
was
as
plentiful
as
here
at
dawn
he
entered
the
hotel
at
millville
with
his
arms
full
of
books
and
papers
which
he
had
succeeded
in
saving
from
the
fire
and
securing
a
room
went
directly
to
bed
it
was
afternoon
when
he
awoke
and
after
obtaining
a
meal
he
strolled
out
into
the
village
and
entered
the
newspaper
office
here
an
item
for
your
paper
he
said
to
patsy
who
was
busy
at
her
desk
the
mills
at
royal
will
never
be
rebuilt
and
millville
has
lost
the
only
chance
it
ever
had
of
becoming
a
manufacturing
center
the
whole
settlement
which
belonged
to
boglin
and
myself
went
up
in
smoke
and
i
willing
to
let
it
go
at
that
i
shall
collect
the
insurance
make
myself
good
and
if
anything
left
over
that
fool
boglin
is
welcome
to
it
i
admit
i
made
a
mistake
in
ever
allowing
him
to
induce
me
to
build
at
royal
boglin
owned
the
land
and
i
used
his
money
so
i
gave
up
to
him
but
i
through
with
the
ass
now
put
it
all
in
the
paper
it
make
him
feel
good
you
might
add
that
i
taking
the
evening
train
for
new
york
shaking
the
dust
of
your
miserable
village
from
my
feet
for
good
and
all
thank
you
sir
said
patsy
brightly
the
millville
people
will
appreciate
their
good
luck
i
sure
skeelty
hung
around
the
town
for
awhile
sneering
at
the
new
electric
light
plant
and
insolently
railing
at
any
of
the
natives
who
would
converse
with
him
then
he
hired
nick
thorne
to
drive
him
over
to
chazy
junction
and
that
was
the
last
millville
ever
saw
of
him
during
this
day
joe
wegg
men
succeeded
in
repairing
all
the
wires
which
had
been
tampered
with
and
in
making
a
proper
and
permanent
connection
of
the
cable
to
the
printing
office
that
evening
the
village
was
again
brilliantly
lighted
and
thereafter
the
big
dynamos
whirled
peacefully
and
without
interruption
the
girls
had
a
busy
day
as
uncle
john
had
predicted
for
all
the
exciting
incidents
of
the
evening
and
night
before
had
to
be
written
up
and
the
next
day
paper
teemed
with
news
of
a
character
to
interest
all
its
readers
beth
editorial
declared
the
neighborhood
well
rid
of
the
paper
mill
which
had
been
of
little
advantage
but
had
caused
no
end
of
annoyance
because
of
the
rough
and
mischievous
character
of
the
workmen
employed
in
this
statement
nearly
everyone
agreed
with
her
several
had
been
wounded
in
the
riot
of
the
eventful
evening
but
none
seriously
injured
the
workmen
took
away
their
damaged
comrades
and
lon
taft
drove
over
to
huntingdon
and
had
his
head
sewed
up
by
the
doctor
other
villagers
suffered
mere
bruises
but
all
who
engaged
in
the
fight
posed
as
heroes
and
even
peggy
mcnutt
who
figured
as
not
present
told
marvelous
tales
of
how
he
had
worsted
seven
mill
hands
in
a
fight
using
only
his
invincible
fists
the
following
forenoon
the
liveryman
at
the
junction
brought
to
millville
a
passenger
who
had
arrived
by
the
morning
train
a
quiet
man
with
a
shock
of
hair
and
a
thin
freckled
face
he
was
driven
directly
to
the
merrick
farm
where
uncle
john
received
him
cordially
but
with
surprise
and
at
once
favored
the
new
arrival
with
a
long
interview
in
his
private
room
the
girls
who
had
not
yet
gone
to
the
office
awaited
somewhat
impatiently
the
result
of
this
conference
for
they
already
knew
the
youth
to
be
the
great
fogerty
admitted
by
even
his
rivals
the
king
of
new
york
detectives
also
they
knew
that
uncle
john
had
employed
him
some
time
ago
to
ferret
out
the
mystery
of
the
identity
of
thursday
smith
and
the
fact
of
fogerty
presence
indicated
he
had
something
to
report
however
when
merrick
came
out
of
the
private
room
his
usually
cheery
countenance
wore
a
troubled
expression
fogerty
was
invariably
placid
and
inscrutable
so
no
explanation
could
be
gleaned
from
his
demeanor
ready
for
town
my
dears
asked
uncle
john
yes
the
surrey
is
waiting
answered
louise
then
go
along
and
fogerty
and
i
will
join
you
at
the
office
presently
i
want
to
confer
with
the
major
and
arthur
before
before
taking
any
steps
to
what
the
news
uncle
demanded
patsy
impatiently
you
shall
know
in
good
time
who
is
thursday
smith
by
and
by
dear
do
bother
me
now
but
that
reminds
me
you
are
to
say
nothing
to
to
thursday
about
fogerty
arrival
treat
him
thursday
you
know
just
as
you
have
always
done
for
the
present
at
least
whatever
we
determine
on
in
regard
to
this
man
during
our
conference
we
must
not
forget
that
he
has
acted
most
gallantly
since
he
came
to
millville
we
really
owe
him
a
debt
of
gratitude
with
this
somewhat
incomprehensible
statement
the
girls
were
forced
to
content
themselves
feeling
quite
helpless
they
drove
to
the
office
and
left
the
men
to
settle
the
fate
of
thursday
smith
the
pressman
was
now
the
about
the
modest
but
trim
little
publishing
plant
he
attended
to
whatever
job
printing
came
in
made
the
etchings
from
hetty
drawings
cast
the
stereotypes
made
up
the
forms
and
operated
the
press
but
aside
from
this
mechanical
work
smith
took
the
telegraphic
news
received
by
hetty
edited
and
condensed
it
and
wrote
the
headings
over
the
various
items
all
this
with
a
general
supervision
over
the
girl
compositors
kept
the
man
busy
from
daybreak
to
midnight
in
spite
of
this
the
tribune
was
essentially
a
girls
paper
since
thursday
smith
was
the
only
man
employed
on
it
not
counting
the
dummy
editor
arthur
weldon
who
did
nothing
but
keep
the
books
and
found
this
not
an
arduous
task
hetty
at
miss
briggs
desk
attended
the
telegraph
instrument
and
telephone
receiving
news
over
both
wires
and
still
found
time
to
draw
her
daily
cartoons
and
additional
humorous
sketches
which
she
worked
in
whenever
the
mood
seized
her
the
typesetting
was
done
by
the
dwyer
sisters
a
colorless
pair
but
quite
reliable
while
the
reportorial
and
editorial
work
was
divided
between
louise
beth
and
patsy
none
of
whom
shirked
a
single
duty
indeed
they
had
come
to
love
this
work
dearly
and
were
enthusiastic
over
the
which
they
fondly
believed
was
being
watched
with
envious
admiration
by
all
the
journalistic
world
this
belief
was
not
wholly
due
to
egotism
their
exchanges
both
city
and
country
had
shown
considerable
interest
in
the
millville
experiment
as
they
called
it
and
only
a
few
days
before
the
leading
journal
of
a
city
had
commented
at
length
on
the
newspaper
and
after
indulging
in
some
humorous
remarks
concluded
quite
seriously
with
the
statement
that
its
evident
sincerity
clean
contents
and
typographical
neatness
render
the
daily
worthy
a
better
setting
than
the
somnolent
country
village
whose
census
is
too
low
to
be
officially
recorded
but
that
all
right
said
patsy
smiling
at
the
praise
we
never
have
dared
to
start
a
newspaper
anywhere
else
because
a
journal
that
will
do
for
millville
might
not
make
a
hit
if
it
bumped
against
experienced
competition
we
were
woefully
ignorant
when
we
began
a
few
weeks
ago
commented
beth
glancing
with
pride
at
her
latest
editorial
which
she
thought
had
caught
the
oracular
tone
of
the
big
city
newspapers
and
we
not
expert
journalists
even
yet
added
louise
with
a
sigh
we
improved
to
be
sure
but
i
imagine
there
is
still
lots
of
room
for
improvement
one
trouble
said
patsy
is
that
every
inhabitant
of
millville
wants
to
see
his
or
her
name
in
print
every
day
whether
he
or
she
has
done
anything
worthy
of
publication
or
not
if
the
name
is
printed
made
an
enemy
and
if
it
is
the
paper
is
sure
to
suffer
more
or
less
ridicule
that
is
quite
true
my
dear
responded
louise
the
reporter
said
everything
about
every
one
of
them
that
has
ever
happened
or
threatened
to
happen
since
we
started
the
paper
and
it
is
driving
me
crazy
to
discover
anything
more
about
these
stupid
natives
that
will
do
to
print
hetty
had
overheard
this
conversation
and
now
looked
up
with
a
smile
has
your
happenings
column
been
prepared
for
mrs
weldon
she
inquired
no
i
about
to
start
out
to
unearth
some
items
replied
louise
wearily
let
me
do
it
for
you
i
an
hour
or
so
to
spare
and
i
wo
need
to
leave
my
desk
suggested
the
artist
it
is
my
duty
you
know
hetty
and
i
no
right
to
evade
it
evade
it
for
go
home
and
rest
i
do
your
column
for
and
after
the
vacation
you
can
tackle
the
thrilling
situations
with
better
courage
thank
you
hetty
but
i
wo
go
home
i
wait
here
to
see
fogerty
fogerty
exclaimed
the
artist
with
a
start
of
surprise
do
you
mean
the
detective
yes
said
louise
regretting
she
had
inadvertently
mentioned
the
name
but
what
is
there
now
to
detect
asked
hetty
suspiciously
our
troubles
seem
ended
with
the
burning
of
the
mill
and
the
flitting
of
skeelty
and
his
workmen
louise
hardly
knew
how
to
reply
but
patsy
who
trusted
the
queer
girl
artist
said
quite
frankly
there
remains
the
mystery
of
thursday
smith
to
fathom
you
know
hetty
flushed
and
an
indignant
look
swept
over
her
face
what
right
has
anyone
to
solve
that
mystery
she
asked
defiantly
is
that
thursday
smith
own
business
perhaps
returned
patsy
somewhat
amused
but
smith
has
been
able
to
discover
who
he
is
or
was
rather
and
seems
really
anxious
to
know
hetty
bent
over
her
desk
for
a
time
then
she
looked
up
and
her
thin
features
were
white
and
drawn
with
anxiety
when
you
discover
who
thursday
smith
is
said
she
the
millville
tribune
will
lose
its
right
bower
why
before
his
accident
or
whatever
it
was
that
made
him
lose
his
memory
he
was
an
unusual
man
a
man
of
exceptional
ability
you
know
that
we
are
all
inclined
to
admit
it
answered
patsy
but
what
then
men
of
ability
declared
hetty
slowly
are
of
two
classes
the
very
successful
who
attain
high
and
honorable
positions
or
the
clever
scoundrels
who
fasten
themselves
like
leeches
on
humanity
and
bleed
their
victims
with
heartless
unconcern
what
will
you
gain
if
you
unmask
the
past
of
thursday
smith
you
uncover
a
rogue
or
a
man
of
affairs
and
in
either
case
you
will
lose
your
pressman
better
leave
the
curtain
drawn
miss
doyle
and
accept
thursday
smith
as
he
is
there
was
so
much
good
sense
in
this
reasoning
that
all
three
girls
were
impressed
and
began
to
regret
that
uncle
john
had
called
fogerty
to
untangle
the
skein
but
it
was
now
too
late
for
such
repentance
and
after
all
they
were
curious
to
discover
who
their
remarkable
employee
really
was
even
while
the
awkward
silence
that
had
fallen
upon
the
group
of
girls
continued
the
door
opened
to
admit
uncle
john
fogerty
major
doyle
and
arthur
weldon
except
for
the
detective
they
were
and
uncompromising
chapter
xxii
unmasked
quintus
fogerty
was
as
unlike
the
typical
detective
as
one
could
imagine
small
in
size
slight
and
boyish
his
years
could
not
readily
be
determined
by
the
ordinary
observer
his
face
was
deeply
furrowed
and
lined
yet
a
few
paces
away
it
seemed
the
face
of
a
boy
of
eighteen
his
cold
gray
eyes
were
persistently
staring
but
conveyed
no
inkling
of
his
thoughts
his
hair
was
as
unkempt
as
if
it
had
never
known
a
comb
yet
the
attire
of
the
great
detective
was
as
fastidiously
neat
as
if
he
had
dressed
for
an
important
social
function
taken
altogether
there
was
something
mistrustful
and
uncanny
about
fogerty
looks
and
his
habit
of
eternally
puffing
cigarettes
rendered
his
companionship
unpleasant
yet
of
the
man
professional
ability
there
was
no
doubt
merrick
and
arthur
weldon
had
had
occasion
to
employ
him
before
with
results
that
justified
their
faith
in
him
the
detective
greeted
the
young
ladies
with
polite
bows
supplemented
by
an
aimless
compliment
on
the
neatness
of
their
office
never
would
have
recognized
it
as
a
newspaper
sanctum
said
he
in
his
thin
piping
voice
no
litter
no
stale
pipes
lying
about
no
cursing
and
quarreling
no
excitement
whatever
the
editorial
room
is
the
index
to
the
workshop
i
see
if
the
mechanical
department
is
kept
as
neatly
he
opened
the
door
to
the
back
room
passed
through
and
closed
it
softly
behind
him
merrick
made
a
dive
for
the
door
and
followed
fogerty
what
the
verdict
arthur
asked
louise
curiously
why
i
i
believe
the
verdict
is
rendered
yet
he
hastily
replied
and
followed
merrick
into
the
pressroom
now
then
cried
patsy
grabbing
the
major
firmly
you
not
stir
a
step
sir
until
you
tell
us
the
news
what
news
patricia
inquired
the
old
gentleman
blandly
who
was
thursday
smith
the
identical
individual
he
is
now
said
the
major
do
prevaricate
sir
who
was
he
what
did
he
do
what
is
his
right
name
is
it
because
you
are
especially
interested
in
this
man
my
dear
or
are
ye
simply
consumed
with
feminine
curiosity
be
good
daddy
tell
us
all
about
it
said
patsy
coaxingly
the
man
thursday
then
was
likely
enough
the
brother
of
robinson
crusoe
man
friday
major
you
trifling
or
mayhap
an
of
the
united
states
or
forby
the
senator
from
oklahoma
belike
he
was
once
minister
to
borneo
an
came
home
in
a
hurry
an
forgot
who
he
was
but
john
merrick
will
be
wanting
me
he
escaped
and
opened
the
door
then
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
he
turned
and
added
why
do
ye
come
in
me
journalistic
investigators
and
see
the
fun
for
yerselves
i
suspect
there
an
item
in
store
for
ye
then
he
went
in
and
they
took
the
hint
and
entered
the
pressroom
in
a
fluttering
group
fogerty
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
intently
watching
the
dwyer
girls
set
type
while
at
his
elbow
merrick
was
explaining
in
a
casual
voice
how
many
m
were
required
to
make
a
newspaper
column
in
another
part
of
the
long
room
arthur
weldon
was
leaning
over
a
table
containing
the
forms
as
if
critically
examining
them
smith
arrayed
in
overalls
and
jumper
was
cleaning
and
oiling
the
big
press
a
daily
newspaper
said
the
major
loudly
as
he
held
up
a
warning
finger
to
the
bevy
of
nieces
behind
whom
hetty
pale
face
appeared
means
a
daily
grind
for
all
concerned
in
it
there
no
vacation
for
the
paper
no
hyphens
no
skipping
a
day
or
two
if
it
has
a
bad
cold
it
the
tyrant
that
leads
its
slaves
by
the
nose
metaphorically
and
has
no
conscience
just
as
regularly
as
the
world
rolls
the
press
rolls
out
the
newspaper
and
human
life
or
death
makes
little
difference
to
either
of
the
revolutionists
while
he
spoke
the
major
led
the
way
across
the
room
to
the
stereotyping
plant
which
brought
his
party
to
a
position
near
the
press
smith
glanced
at
them
and
went
on
with
his
work
it
was
not
unusual
to
have
the
pressroom
thus
invaded
presently
fogerty
strolled
over
smoking
his
eternal
cigarette
and
stood
watching
the
pressman
as
if
interested
in
the
oiling
of
the
complicated
machine
smith
feeling
himself
under
observation
glanced
up
again
in
an
unconcerned
way
and
as
he
faced
the
detective
fogerty
gave
a
cleverly
assumed
start
and
exclaimed
good
god
instantly
thursday
smith
straightened
up
and
looked
at
the
man
questioningly
fogerty
stretched
out
his
hand
and
said
as
if
in
wonder
why
melville
old
man
what
are
you
doing
here
we
wondered
what
had
become
of
you
all
these
months
shake
hands
my
boy
i
glad
found
you
smith
leaned
against
the
press
and
stared
at
him
with
dilated
eyes
everyone
in
the
room
was
regarding
the
scene
with
intense
but
repressed
excitement
what
wrong
harold
continued
fogerty
as
if
hurt
by
the
hesitation
to
acknowledge
their
acquaintance
you
have
forgotten
me
have
you
i
mccormick
you
know
and
you
and
i
have
had
many
a
good
time
together
in
the
past
smith
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
with
a
dazed
gesture
what
name
did
you
call
me
sir
he
asked
melville
harold
melville
of
east
street
i
sure
right
there
ca
be
two
like
you
in
the
world
you
know
thursday
smith
stepped
down
from
the
platform
and
with
a
staggering
gait
walked
to
a
stool
on
which
he
weakly
sank
he
wiped
the
beads
of
perspiration
from
his
forehead
and
looked
at
fogerty
with
a
half
frightened
air
and
you
are
mccormick
he
faltered
of
course
smith
stared
a
moment
and
then
shook
his
head
it
no
use
he
said
despairingly
i
ca
recall
a
single
memory
of
either
harold
melville
or
or
his
friend
mccormick
pardon
me
sir
i
must
confess
my
mind
is
absolutely
blank
concerning
all
my
life
previous
to
the
last
two
years
until
this
moment
i
i
could
not
recall
my
own
name
h
muttered
fogerty
you
recall
it
now
do
you
no
you
tell
me
my
name
is
melville
and
you
seem
to
recognize
me
as
a
man
whom
you
once
knew
i
accept
your
statement
in
good
faith
but
i
can
not
corroborate
it
from
my
own
knowledge
that
queer
retorted
fogerty
his
cold
eyes
fixed
upon
the
face
let
me
explain
please
said
smith
and
related
his
curious
experience
in
practically
the
same
words
he
had
employed
when
confiding
it
to
merrick
i
had
hoped
he
concluded
that
if
ever
i
met
one
who
knew
me
formerly
or
heard
my
right
name
mentioned
my
memory
would
come
back
to
me
but
in
this
i
am
sorely
disappointed
did
you
know
me
well
sir
pretty
well
answered
the
detective
after
a
slight
hesitation
then
tell
me
something
about
myself
tell
me
who
i
was
here
in
public
asked
fogerty
with
a
suggestive
glance
at
the
spectators
who
had
involuntarily
crowded
nearer
smith
flushed
but
gazed
firmly
into
the
faces
surrounding
him
why
not
he
returned
these
young
ladies
and
merrick
accepted
me
without
knowledge
of
my
antecedents
they
are
entitled
to
as
full
an
explanation
as
as
i
am
you
place
me
melville
in
a
rather
embarrassing
position
declared
fogerty
this
is
a
queer
case
the
queerest
in
all
my
experience
better
let
me
post
you
in
a
private
interview
smith
trembled
a
bit
from
nervousness
but
he
persisted
in
his
demand
these
people
are
entitled
to
the
truth
said
he
tell
us
frankly
all
you
know
about
me
and
do
not
mince
words
whatever
the
truth
may
be
oh
it
not
so
bad
announced
the
detective
with
a
shrug
or
at
least
it
would
be
in
new
york
among
your
old
aristocratic
haunts
but
here
in
a
quiet
country
town
among
these
generous
and
folks
who
have
befriended
you
the
thing
is
rather
difficult
to
say
say
it
commanded
smith
i
will
many
new
yorkers
remember
the
firm
of
melville
ford
the
cleverest
pair
of
confidence
men
who
ever
undertook
to
fleece
the
wealthy
lambs
of
the
metropolis
confidence
men
gasped
smith
in
a
voice
of
horror
yes
putting
it
mildly
you
were
both
jolly
good
fellows
and
made
a
host
of
friends
you
were
rode
in
automobiles
frequented
good
clubs
and
had
a
stunning
establishment
on
street
where
you
entertained
lavishly
you
could
afford
to
for
there
was
where
you
fleeced
your
victims
but
it
was
so
very
bad
as
i
said
you
chose
the
wealthy
sons
of
the
who
were
glad
to
know
such
popular
as
harold
melville
and
edgar
ford
when
one
set
of
innocents
had
been
so
thoroughly
trimmed
that
they
compared
notes
and
began
to
avoid
you
you
had
only
to
pick
up
another
bunch
of
lambs
for
new
york
contains
many
distinct
flocks
of
the
species
as
they
could
afford
to
lose
none
of
them
ever
complained
to
the
police
although
the
central
office
had
an
eye
on
you
and
knew
your
methods
perfectly
finally
you
made
a
mistake
or
rather
ford
did
for
he
was
not
as
clever
as
you
were
he
brought
an
imitation
millionaire
to
your
house
a
fellow
who
was
putting
up
a
brazen
front
on
the
smallest
sort
of
a
roll
you
won
his
money
and
he
denounced
you
getting
away
with
a
pack
of
marked
cards
for
evidence
at
this
you
both
took
fright
and
decided
on
a
hasty
retreat
gathering
together
your
plunder
which
was
a
royal
sum
i
convinced
you
and
ford
jumped
into
a
motor
car
and
vanished
from
new
york
the
balance
of
your
history
i
base
on
premise
ford
has
been
located
in
chicago
where
with
an
ample
supply
of
money
he
is
repeating
his
new
york
operations
but
harold
melville
has
never
been
heard
of
until
this
day
i
think
the
true
explanation
is
easily
arrived
at
goaded
by
cupidity
and
perhaps
envy
of
your
superior
talents
ford
took
advantage
of
the
situation
and
finding
the
automobile
speeding
along
a
deserted
road
knocked
you
on
the
head
tumbled
you
out
of
the
car
and
made
off
with
your
combined
winnings
the
blow
had
the
effect
not
so
uncommon
as
you
think
of
destroying
your
recollection
of
your
past
life
and
you
have
for
two
years
been
wandering
in
total
ignorance
of
what
caused
your
affliction
during
this
recital
smith
sat
with
his
eyes
eagerly
fixed
upon
the
speaker
face
dwelling
upon
every
word
at
the
conclusion
of
the
story
he
dropped
his
face
in
his
hands
a
moment
visibly
shuddering
then
again
he
looked
up
and
after
reading
the
circle
of
pitying
faces
confronting
him
he
bravely
met
merrick
eyes
sir
he
said
in
a
voice
that
faltered
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
render
it
firm
you
now
know
who
i
am
when
i
first
came
to
you
i
was
a
mere
irresponsible
hobo
a
wandering
tramp
who
had
adopted
the
name
of
thursday
smith
because
he
was
ignorant
of
his
own
but
who
had
no
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
his
manhood
i
am
discovered
in
my
true
guise
as
harold
melville
the
disreputable
trickster
i
am
not
fit
to
remain
in
your
employ
to
associate
with
honest
men
and
women
you
will
forgive
my
imposition
i
think
because
you
know
how
thoroughly
ignorant
i
was
of
the
truth
but
i
will
impose
upon
you
no
longer
i
am
sorry
sir
for
i
have
been
happy
here
but
i
will
go
thanking
you
for
the
kindly
generosity
that
prompted
you
to
accept
me
as
i
seemed
to
be
not
as
i
am
he
rose
his
face
showing
evidence
of
suffering
and
bowed
gravely
hetty
hewitt
walked
over
and
stood
by
his
side
laying
her
hand
gently
upon
his
arm
but
thursday
smith
did
not
know
john
merrick
very
well
the
little
gentleman
had
silently
listened
observing
meanwhile
the
demeanor
of
the
accused
and
now
he
smiled
in
his
pleasant
whimsical
way
and
caught
smith
hand
in
both
his
own
man
man
he
cried
you
misjudging
both
me
and
yourself
i
know
this
fellow
melville
you
do
know
him
either
but
i
do
know
thursday
smith
who
has
won
my
confidence
and
by
his
manly
acts
and
i
stand
by
him
through
thick
and
thin
i
am
harold
melville
the
gambler
the
confidence
man
you
nothing
of
the
sort
you
just
thursday
smith
and
no
more
responsible
for
harold
melville
than
i
am
hooray
exclaimed
patsy
doyle
enthusiastically
uncle
right
thursday
you
our
friend
and
the
mainstay
of
the
daily
we
shall
not
allow
you
to
desert
us
just
because
discovered
that
your
your
ancestor
was
quite
respectable
that
it
exactly
asserted
beth
it
like
hearing
a
tale
of
an
ancestor
thursday
or
of
some
member
of
your
family
who
lived
before
you
you
can
not
be
responsible
in
any
way
for
another
wickedness
as
i
look
at
it
said
louise
reflectively
you
are
just
two
years
old
thursday
and
innocent
of
any
wrongdoing
before
that
day
you
first
found
yourself
there
no
use
our
considering
melville
at
all
added
uncle
john
cheerfully
i
sorry
we
ever
heard
of
him
except
that
in
one
way
it
clears
up
a
mystery
thursday
smith
we
like
you
and
trust
you
do
not
doubt
yourself
because
of
this
tale
i
vouch
for
your
fairness
and
integrity
forget
melville
who
has
never
really
existed
so
far
as
any
of
us
are
concerned
be
yourself
and
count
on
our
friendship
and
regard
which
thursday
smith
has
fairly
won
hetty
was
crying
softly
her
cheek
laid
against
thursday
sleeve
the
man
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
but
his
cheeks
were
flushed
his
eyes
sparkling
and
his
head
proudly
poised
fogerty
lighted
a
fresh
cigarette
watching
the
scene
with
an
imperturbable
smile
suddenly
smith
awoke
to
life
he
half
turned
looked
wonderingly
at
hetty
and
then
folded
her
thin
form
in
his
arms
and
pressed
a
kiss
on
her
forehead
fogerty
coughed
uncle
john
jerked
out
his
handkerchief
and
blew
his
nose
like
a
bugle
call
the
major
eyes
were
moist
for
the
old
soldier
was
sympathetic
as
a
child
but
patsy
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
impulsively
put
her
arms
around
the
unashamed
pair
and
murmured
i
so
glad
hetty
i
so
glad
thursday
but
dear
me
are
we
going
to
have
any
paper
morning
that
relieved
the
tension
and
everybody
laughed
thursday
released
hetty
and
shook
uncle
john
hand
most
gratefully
then
they
all
wanted
to
shake
hands
and
did
until
it
came
to
fogerty
turn
but
now
smith
drew
back
and
looked
askance
at
the
detective
i
do
not
know
you
mccormick
he
said
with
dignity
my
name
not
mccormick
it
fogerty
said
the
other
without
malice
i
was
simply
testing
your
memory
by
claiming
to
be
an
old
friend
personally
i
never
knew
harold
melville
but
i
mighty
glad
to
make
thursday
smith
acquaintance
and
will
consider
it
an
honor
if
shake
my
hand
smith
was
too
happy
to
refuse
he
took
fogerty
hand
chapter
xxiii
the
journalists
abdicate
merrick
told
thursday
smith
in
an
apologetic
way
how
he
had
hired
fogerty
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
his
former
life
and
how
the
great
detective
had
gone
to
work
so
intelligently
and
skillfully
that
with
the
aid
of
a
sketch
hetty
had
once
made
of
the
pressman
and
which
merrick
sent
on
he
had
been
able
to
identify
the
man
and
unearth
the
disagreeable
details
of
his
history
thursday
was
too
humble
by
this
time
and
too
grateful
besides
to
resent
uncle
john
interference
he
admitted
that
after
all
it
was
better
he
should
know
the
truth
i
nothing
to
bother
me
now
but
the
future
he
said
and
with
help
i
mean
to
keep
the
name
of
thursday
smith
clean
and
free
from
any
reproach
after
the
interview
he
went
about
his
duties
as
before
and
hetty
sat
down
at
her
desk
and
took
the
telegraphic
news
that
came
clicking
over
the
wire
as
if
nothing
important
in
her
life
had
occurred
but
the
girl
journalists
were
all
excitement
and
already
were
beginning
to
plan
the
things
they
might
do
to
make
hetty
and
thursday
happier
cox
and
booth
had
gone
away
and
merrick
thanked
fogerty
for
his
skillful
service
and
gave
him
a
fat
check
it
a
mighty
interesting
case
sir
declared
the
detective
and
as
glad
as
any
of
you
that
it
has
ended
so
comfortably
whatever
melville
might
have
been
and
his
record
is
a
little
worse
than
i
related
it
there
no
doubt
of
thursday
smith
honesty
he
a
mighty
fine
fellow
and
fate
played
a
proper
trick
when
she
blotted
out
his
unscrupulous
mind
and
left
him
as
innocent
as
an
unborn
babe
he
will
do
well
in
his
new
life
i
sure
and
that
girl
of
his
hetty
hewitt
know
of
her
reckless
ways
for
years
has
also
redeemed
herself
and
turned
out
a
regular
brick
all
of
which
merrick
is
unusual
in
real
life
more
the
pity
and
therefore
it
makes
even
a
detective
feel
good
to
witness
it
merrick
smiled
benignantly
and
fogerty
drove
over
to
the
junction
to
catch
his
train
after
luncheon
patsy
while
arranging
her
galley
proofs
inquired
of
louise
for
the
local
column
hetty
said
she
attend
to
it
was
the
reply
but
we
are
all
upset
and
things
are
at
sixes
and
sevens
the
column
is
all
prepared
miss
doyle
announced
hetty
where
is
it
thursday
has
made
it
ready
for
the
press
it
illustrated
she
confessed
i
rather
you
would
see
it
until
the
paper
is
out
if
you
can
trust
me
to
be
sure
said
patsy
that
one
responsibility
i
relieved
of
anyhow
the
paper
was
a
bit
uneven
in
appearance
next
morning
but
when
patsy
came
down
to
breakfast
she
found
both
uncle
john
and
the
major
roaring
with
laughter
over
hetty
locals
the
first
item
stated
that
thorne
took
tea
at
sam
cotting
last
evening
the
cottings
being
notoriously
inhospitable
and
the
picture
showed
thorne
a
woman
departing
from
the
store
with
a
package
of
tea
then
came
the
announcement
that
eph
hildreth
got
shot
at
west
hardware
store
and
there
was
a
picture
of
west
weighing
out
a
pound
of
buckshot
for
his
customer
the
next
item
said
our
distinguished
fellow
citizen
marshall
peggy
mcnutt
was
discovered
unconscious
on
his
front
porch
at
the
drawing
of
mcnutt
was
one
of
the
best
of
the
series
it
was
his
habit
to
snooze
in
an
easy
chair
on
his
porch
every
afternoon
and
hetty
depicted
the
little
man
with
both
feet
meat
and
wood
on
the
rail
his
mouth
open
and
eyes
shut
while
lusty
snores
were
indicated
by
radiating
lines
and
exclamation
points
the
widow
clark
cow
occupied
the
next
square
being
tethered
to
a
stake
while
skim
approached
the
animal
with
pail
and
below
the
drawing
were
the
words
skimton
clark
cowward
a
few
other
local
hits
were
concluded
by
a
picture
of
hon
ojoy
boglin
shaking
his
fist
at
skeelty
who
held
a
package
of
money
in
his
grasp
labeled
insurance
below
was
the
simple
legend
o
joy
the
artist
cleverness
became
the
subject
of
conversation
at
the
breakfast
table
and
arthur
remarked
you
wo
be
able
to
hold
hetty
in
millville
long
her
talent
enables
her
to
draw
big
salaries
in
new
york
and
it
is
likely
she
will
consent
to
bury
herself
in
this
little
town
i
not
so
sure
said
patsy
if
we
can
hold
thursday
smith
we
can
hold
hetty
you
know
we
wo
need
to
hold
either
of
them
for
long
observed
beth
for
in
another
three
weeks
or
so
we
must
leave
here
and
return
to
the
city
when
of
course
the
daily
must
suspend
publication
i
been
thinking
of
that
said
uncle
john
so
have
i
declared
patsy
for
a
long
time
i
was
puzzled
what
to
do
for
i
hated
dreadfully
to
kill
our
dear
after
we
made
it
such
a
nice
paper
yet
i
knew
very
well
we
could
stay
here
all
winter
and
run
it
but
last
night
i
had
an
inspiration
thursday
will
marry
hetty
i
suppose
and
they
can
both
stay
here
and
run
the
tribune
they
are
doing
most
of
the
work
now
if
uncle
john
agrees
we
will
sell
out
to
them
on
terms
good
gracious
patsy
chuckled
the
major
wherever
can
the
poor
things
borrow
money
to
keep
going
do
you
want
to
load
onto
an
innocent
bride
an
groom
the
necessity
of
meeting
a
deficit
of
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
every
week
patsy
face
fell
they
have
no
money
i
know
she
said
except
what
they
earn
and
their
wages
be
cut
off
when
they
begin
hiring
themselves
added
the
major
no
you
ca
decently
thrust
such
an
incubus
on
hetty
and
thursday
or
on
anyone
else
you
been
willing
to
pay
the
piper
for
the
sake
of
the
dance
but
no
one
else
would
do
it
quite
true
agreed
arthur
the
days
of
the
are
numbered
let
us
not
settle
that
question
just
yet
proposed
merrick
who
had
been
deep
in
thought
i
consider
patsy
proposition
for
awhile
and
then
talk
with
thursday
the
paper
belongs
to
the
girls
but
the
outfit
is
mine
and
i
suppose
i
may
do
what
i
please
with
it
when
my
nieces
retire
from
journalism
even
the
major
could
not
demur
at
this
statement
and
so
the
conversation
dropped
during
the
next
few
days
uncle
john
visited
the
printing
office
several
times
and
looked
over
the
complete
little
plant
with
speculative
eyes
then
one
day
he
made
a
trip
to
malvern
thirty
miles
up
the
railway
line
from
the
junction
where
a
successful
weekly
paper
had
long
been
published
he
interviewed
the
editor
examined
the
outfit
critically
and
after
asking
numerous
questions
returned
to
millville
in
excellent
spirits
then
he
invited
thursday
smith
and
hetty
to
dine
at
the
farm
on
saturday
evening
which
was
the
one
evening
in
the
week
they
were
free
there
being
no
sunday
morning
paper
thursday
had
bought
a
new
suit
of
clothes
since
he
came
to
the
and
hetty
after
much
urging
finally
prevailed
upon
him
to
accept
the
invitation
when
the
young
man
appeared
at
the
farm
he
wore
his
new
suit
with
an
air
of
perfect
ease
that
disguised
its
cheapness
and
it
was
noticed
that
he
seemed
quite
at
home
in
the
handsome
where
the
party
assembled
after
dinner
i
am
in
search
of
information
thursday
said
uncle
john
in
his
pleasant
way
will
you
permit
me
to
question
you
a
bit
certainly
sir
and
you
hetty
ask
anything
you
like
sir
thank
you
to
begin
with
what
are
your
future
plans
i
understand
of
course
you
are
to
be
married
but
afterward
we
have
considered
that
as
yet
sir
replied
thursday
thoughtfully
of
course
we
shall
stay
with
the
as
long
as
you
care
to
employ
our
services
but
well
i
have
been
given
to
understand
the
young
ladies
plan
to
return
to
new
york
at
the
end
of
september
and
in
that
case
of
course
the
paper
will
suspend
my
nieces
will
be
obliged
to
abandon
journalism
to
be
sure
said
merrick
but
i
see
no
reason
why
the
paper
should
suspend
how
would
you
and
hetty
like
to
remain
in
millville
and
run
it
both
thursday
and
hetty
smiled
but
it
was
the
man
who
answered
we
can
not
afford
such
a
luxury
sir
would
you
care
to
make
your
future
home
in
millville
oh
yes
exclaimed
hetty
i
love
the
quaint
little
town
dearly
and
the
villagers
are
all
my
friends
i
sure
thursday
does
care
to
go
back
to
new
york
where
where
harold
melville
once
lived
but
as
he
truly
says
we
could
make
a
living
with
the
even
if
you
gave
us
the
use
of
the
plant
let
us
see
about
that
said
uncle
john
i
will
admit
in
advance
that
a
daily
paper
in
such
a
place
is
absurd
none
of
us
quite
understood
that
when
we
established
the
my
nieces
thought
a
daily
the
only
satisfactory
sort
of
newspaper
because
they
were
used
to
such
but
it
did
not
take
long
to
convince
me
and
perhaps
them
that
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
the
daily
would
never
thrive
it
is
too
expensive
to
pay
its
own
way
and
requires
too
much
work
to
be
a
pleasant
plaything
only
unbounded
enthusiasm
and
energy
have
enabled
my
clever
nieces
to
avoid
being
swamped
by
the
monster
their
ambition
created
that
said
patsy
with
a
laugh
is
very
clearly
and
concisely
put
my
dear
uncle
it
was
never
intended
to
be
a
permanent
thing
anyhow
continued
merrick
yet
i
must
express
my
admiration
for
the
courage
and
talent
my
nieces
have
displayed
in
forcing
a
temporary
success
where
failure
was
the
logical
conclusion
shortly
however
they
intend
to
retire
gracefully
from
the
field
of
journalism
leaving
me
with
a
model
country
newspaper
plant
on
my
hands
therefore
it
is
i
thursday
and
hetty
and
not
my
nieces
who
have
a
proposition
to
place
before
you
while
a
daily
paper
is
not
appropriate
in
millville
a
weekly
paper
distributed
throughout
chazy
county
would
not
only
be
desirable
but
could
be
made
to
pay
an
excellent
yearly
profit
through
the
enterprise
of
joe
wegg
millville
is
destined
to
grow
rapidly
from
this
time
on
and
chazy
county
is
populous
enough
to
support
a
good
weekly
paper
in
any
event
therefore
my
proposition
is
this
to
turn
the
plant
over
to
and
thursday
smith
who
will
change
the
name
to
the
weekly
and
run
it
as
a
permanent
institution
your
only
expense
for
labor
will
be
one
assistant
to
set
type
and
do
odd
jobs
since
you
are
so
competent
that
you
can
attend
to
all
else
yourselves
we
will
cut
out
the
expensive
news
service
we
have
heretofore
indulged
in
and
dispense
with
the
private
telegraph
wire
joe
wegg
says
he
furnish
you
with
what
power
you
need
free
of
all
charge
because
the
paper
will
boost
millville
interests
with
which
his
own
interests
are
identified
now
then
tell
me
what
you
think
of
my
proposal
hetty
and
thursday
had
listened
attentively
and
their
faces
proved
they
were
enthusiastic
over
the
idea
they
said
at
once
they
would
be
glad
to
undertake
the
proposition
however
said
thursday
after
a
little
reflection
there
are
two
things
that
might
render
our
acceptance
impossible
i
suppose
you
will
require
rent
for
the
outfit
but
for
a
time
until
we
get
well
started
we
could
not
afford
to
pay
as
much
as
you
have
a
right
to
demand
i
have
settled
on
my
demands
replied
merrick
and
hope
you
will
agree
to
them
you
must
pay
me
for
the
use
of
the
outfit
twenty
per
cent
of
your
net
profits
over
and
above
all
your
operating
and
living
expenses
when
this
sum
has
reimbursed
me
for
my
investment
the
outfit
will
belong
to
you
thursday
smith
looked
his
amazement
that
seems
hardly
sir
he
protested
you
are
right
but
this
is
entirely
a
business
deal
you
are
saving
my
nieces
the
humiliation
of
suspending
the
paper
they
established
and
have
labored
on
so
lovingly
moreover
i
regard
you
and
hetty
as
friends
whom
i
am
glad
to
put
in
the
way
of
a
modest
but
i
venture
to
predict
a
successful
business
career
what
is
your
second
objection
i
heard
west
say
the
other
day
that
he
would
soon
need
the
building
we
occupy
to
store
his
farm
machinery
in
true
but
i
have
anticipated
that
i
have
completed
plans
for
the
erection
of
a
new
building
for
the
newspaper
which
will
be
located
on
the
vacant
lot
next
to
the
hotel
i
purchased
the
lot
a
long
time
ago
the
new
building
for
which
the
lumber
is
already
ordered
will
be
a
better
one
than
the
shed
we
are
now
in
and
on
the
second
floor
i
intend
to
have
a
cozy
suite
of
rooms
where
you
and
hetty
can
make
a
home
of
your
own
eh
how
does
that
strike
you
my
children
their
faces
were
full
of
wonder
and
delight
the
new
building
goes
with
the
outfit
on
the
same
terms
continued
merrick
that
is
i
take
of
your
net
profits
for
the
whole
thing
but
sir
suggested
thursday
suppose
no
profits
materialize
then
i
have
induced
you
to
undertake
a
poor
venture
and
must
suffer
the
consequences
which
to
me
will
be
no
hardship
at
all
in
that
case
i
will
agree
to
find
some
better
business
for
you
but
i
am
quite
positive
you
will
make
a
go
of
the
weekly
i
think
so
too
merrick
or
i
would
not
accept
your
generous
offer
replied
smith
what
do
you
think
hetty
the
idea
pleases
me
immensely
she
declared
it
is
a
splendid
opportunity
for
us
and
will
enable
us
to
live
here
quietly
and
forget
the
big
outside
world
new
york
has
had
a
bad
influence
on
both
you
and
me
thursday
and
here
we
can
begin
a
new
life
of
absolute
respectability
when
do
you
intend
to
be
married
asked
patsy
we
have
scarcely
thought
of
that
as
yet
for
until
this
evening
we
did
not
know
what
the
future
held
in
store
for
us
could
you
arrange
the
wedding
before
we
leave
asked
beth
it
would
delight
us
so
much
to
be
present
at
the
ceremony
i
think
we
owe
the
young
ladies
that
much
thursday
said
hetty
after
a
brief
hesitation
nothing
could
please
me
better
he
asserted
eagerly
so
they
canvassed
the
wedding
and
patsy
proposed
they
transfer
the
paper
to
thursday
and
hetty
to
become
a
weekly
instead
of
a
daily
in
a
week
time
and
celebrate
the
wedding
immediately
after
the
second
issue
so
as
to
give
the
bridal
couple
a
brief
vacation
before
getting
to
work
again
neither
of
them
wished
to
take
a
wedding
trip
and
merrick
promised
to
rush
the
work
on
the
new
building
so
they
could
move
into
their
new
rooms
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
chapter
xxiv
a
cheerful
blunder
we
would
like
to
ask
your
advice
about
one
thing
sir
said
thursday
smith
to
merrick
a
little
later
that
same
evening
would
it
be
legal
for
me
to
marry
under
the
name
of
thursday
smith
or
must
i
use
my
real
name
harold
melville
uncle
john
could
not
answer
this
question
nor
could
the
major
or
arthur
hetty
and
her
fiancú
had
both
decided
to
cling
to
the
name
of
thursday
smith
thereafter
and
they
disliked
to
be
married
under
any
other
especially
the
detestable
one
of
harold
melville
an
act
of
legislature
would
render
your
new
name
legal
i
believe
said
merrick
but
such
an
act
could
not
be
passed
until
after
the
date
you
have
planned
to
be
married
but
if
it
was
made
legal
afterward
it
would
matter
greatly
suggested
the
major
i
do
not
think
it
matters
at
all
asserted
hetty
it
the
man
marrying
not
his
name
i
do
much
care
what
he
calls
himself
oh
but
it
must
be
legal
you
know
exclaimed
patsy
you
do
care
now
perhaps
but
you
might
in
the
future
we
can
not
be
certain
you
know
that
thursday
is
entirely
free
from
his
former
connection
with
harold
melville
quite
true
agreed
the
major
then
said
smith
with
evident
disappointment
i
must
use
the
hateful
name
of
melville
for
the
wedding
and
afterward
abandon
it
for
as
long
as
possible
the
nieces
were
greatly
pleased
with
uncle
john
arrangement
which
relieved
them
of
the
newspaper
and
also
furnished
thursday
and
hetty
of
whom
they
had
grown
really
fond
with
a
means
of
gaining
a
livelihood
millville
accepted
the
new
arrangement
with
little
adverse
comment
the
villagers
being
quite
satisfied
with
a
weekly
paper
which
would
cost
them
far
less
than
the
daily
had
done
everyone
was
pleased
to
know
thursday
smith
had
acquired
the
business
for
both
he
and
hetty
had
won
the
cordial
friendship
of
the
people
and
were
a
little
nearer
to
them
than
the
nabob
girls
could
ever
be
preparations
were
speedily
pushed
forward
for
the
wedding
which
the
nieces
undertook
to
manage
themselves
the
prospective
bride
and
groom
being
too
busy
at
the
newspaper
office
to
devote
much
attention
to
the
preliminaries
of
the
great
event
the
ceremony
was
to
take
place
at
the
farmhouse
of
merrick
and
every
inhabitant
of
millville
was
invited
to
be
present
the
minister
would
drive
over
from
hooker
falls
and
the
ceremony
was
to
be
followed
by
a
grand
feast
for
which
delicacies
were
to
be
imported
from
new
york
the
girls
provided
a
complete
trousseau
for
hetty
as
their
wedding
present
while
arthur
and
the
major
undertook
to
furnish
the
new
apartments
which
were
already
under
construction
uncle
john
gift
was
a
substantial
check
that
would
furnish
the
newly
married
couple
with
modest
capital
to
promote
their
business
or
which
they
could
use
in
case
of
emergencies
it
was
the
very
day
before
the
wedding
that
fogerty
gave
them
so
great
and
agreeable
a
surprise
that
uncle
john
called
it
fogerty
wedding
present
ever
afterward
in
its
physical
form
it
was
merely
a
telegram
but
in
its
spiritual
and
moral
aspect
it
proved
the
greatest
gift
thursday
and
hetty
were
destined
to
receive
the
telegram
was
dated
from
new
york
and
read
as
follows
harold
melville
just
arrested
here
for
passing
a
bogus
check
under
an
assumed
name
have
interviewed
him
and
find
he
is
really
melville
so
thursday
smith
must
be
some
one
else
and
doubtless
a
more
respectable
character
shall
i
undertake
to
discover
his
real
identity
uncle
john
let
thursday
and
hetty
answer
this
question
and
their
reply
was
a
positive
no
the
great
fogerty
made
such
a
blunder
the
first
time
said
hetty
who
was
overjoyed
at
the
glorious
news
that
he
might
give
poor
thursday
another
dreadful
scare
if
he
tackled
the
job
again
let
the
mystery
remain
unfathomable
but
on
the
contrary
my
dear
fogerty
might
discover
that
thursday
was
some
eminent
and
good
man
as
i
am
firmly
convinced
is
the
truth
suggested
merrick
he
that
right
now
asserted
hetty
for
my
part
i
prefer
to
know
nothing
of
his
former
history
and
thursday
says
the
present
situation
thoroughly
contents
him
i
am
more
than
contented
said
thursday
with
a
happy
smile
hetty
has
cured
me
of
my
desire
to
wander
and
no
matter
what
i
might
have
been
in
the
past
i
am
satisfied
to
remain
hereafter
