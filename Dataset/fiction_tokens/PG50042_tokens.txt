forgery
or

the
forgery
chapter
i
introductory
one
of
the
finest
characters
in
the
world
was
the
old
english
merchant
we
may
and
have
improved
upon
many
things
but
not
upon
that
a
different
spirit
reigns
in
commerce
from
that
which
ruled
it
long
ago
and
not
a
better
one
we
are
more
the
shopkeeper
as
a
celebrated
but
not
a
great
man
called
us
and
less
the
merchant
as
a
people
our
commerce
is
more
extended
but
the
separate
transactions
are
smaller
and
minute
dealings
almost
always
produce
paltry
minds
not
at
all
do
i
mean
to
say
that
the
old
english
merchant
is
without
his
representatives
but
they
are
fewer
than
in
other
times
both
with
reference
to
our
numbers
and
to
our
extended
trade
there
are
many
still
however
whose
notions
are
as
vast
and
as
just
as
those
of
any
of
our
ancestors
and
amongst
them
not
very
long
ago
was
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
humphrey
scriven
he
was
a
and
man
the
son
of
wealthy
and
respectable
parents
in
a
class
of
society
peculiar
to
england
the
untitled
country
gentry
and
he
had
been
originally
intended
for
the
church
circumstances
however
are
to
most
men
fate
he
became
acquainted
by
some
mere
accident
with
the
only
daughter
of
a
rich
merchant
admired
loved
her
and
won
her
love
in
return
he
was
a
younger
son
but
nevertheless
her
father
was
a
kind
and
liberal
man
and
he
consented
to
their
marriage
upon
one
condition
that
scriven
should
abandon
his
intention
of
entering
the
church
and
become
a
merchant
like
himself
he
fancied
that
he
had
perceived
in
the
young
man
a
peculiar
aptitude
for
business
and
he
was
not
mistaken
scriven
became
his
his
partner
and
his
successor
and
well
did
he
bear
up
the
name
and
honour
of
the
house
it
was
a
fine
thing
to
see
him
some
twenty
years
after
his
marriage
when
with
the
business
of
the
day
over
he
sat
in
his
splendid
house
in
james
square
surrounded
by
his
family
and
often
associated
with
the
noblest
and
the
proudest
of
the
land
his
wife
was
no
longer
living
but
she
had
left
him
four
very
handsome
children
she
had
herself
been
remarkably
beautiful
and
her
husband
was
as
fine
a
looking
man
as
eye
could
see
tall
graceful
vigorous
and
possessing
that
air
of
dignity
which
springs
from
dignity
of
mind
from
the
moment
that
five
struck
scriven
cast
off
all
thought
and
care
of
business
for
though
there
were
of
course
with
him
as
with
other
men
engaged
in
similar
pursuits
fluctuations
and
changes
bad
speculations
failing
debtors
and
wrecked
ships
still
his
transactions
were
too
extensive
for
the
loss
of
a
few
thousand
pounds
here
or
there
to
weigh
upon
his
mind
and
being
of
a
cheerful
and
happy
disposition
he
spread
sunshine
through
his
dwelling
his
family
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
consisted
of
three
daughters
and
one
son
who
was
born
some
four
or
five
years
after
the
youngest
sister
the
daughters
were
all
lovely
kind
affectionate
and
gentle
in
disposition
very
much
alike
in
person
and
so
nearly
of
an
age
that
it
was
difficult
to
tell
which
was
the
eldest
there
was
indeed
some
difference
in
character
in
point
of
force
and
vigour
of
reason
but
the
spirit
and
the
heart
were
the
same
maria
the
eldest
was
a
girl
of
much
good
sense
but
of
a
very
humble
appreciation
of
her
own
qualities
and
advantages
she
thought
little
of
her
beauty
and
less
of
her
wealth
and
her
humility
mere
people
looked
upon
as
weakness
isabella
the
second
though
neither
haughty
nor
presuming
was
of
a
far
more
decided
and
independent
nature
but
margaret
the
third
was
all
gentle
kindness
with
much
less
mere
intellect
than
either
of
her
sisters
she
had
sense
enough
and
principle
enough
never
to
do
anything
that
was
wrong
but
not
enough
worldly
wisdom
to
guard
her
own
interests
against
her
affections
the
son
was
at
this
time
a
boy
of
fifteen
a
sharp
clever
lad
who
had
been
a
good
deal
petted
by
his
mother
and
had
been
taught
by
circumstances
to
attach
more
importance
to
the
possession
of
wealth
than
it
deserves
in
great
things
scriven
seldom
made
mistakes
in
small
ones
he
often
did
and
one
of
his
mistakes
was
in
not
looking
upon
trifles
in
education
as
important
perhaps
it
is
there
alone
that
they
really
are
important
for
every
idea
received
in
youth
has
a
vast
development
in
maturity
the
seed
may
be
small
and
insignificant
in
appearance
but
once
sown
it
is
sure
to
grow
and
may
spread
to
a
great
tree
the
father
destined
his
boy
to
succeed
him
in
his
though
very
wealthy
he
had
no
inclination
that
his
son
should
spend
the
fruit
of
his
ancestors
labours
in
idleness
he
had
a
great
idea
of
the
dignity
of
commerce
and
henry
scriven
was
taught
from
his
earliest
years
that
he
was
to
be
a
merchant
he
was
educated
with
that
view
and
early
initiated
into
business
matters
could
scriven
himself
have
given
up
his
time
and
attention
to
the
lad
he
might
have
acquired
with
all
the
practical
details
great
views
and
noble
purposes
but
his
father
time
was
necessarily
greatly
occupied
and
he
also
felt
some
doubts
as
to
his
parental
fondness
leaving
his
judgment
room
to
act
in
the
case
of
his
own
child
at
the
age
of
fifteen
then
he
sent
him
to
receive
the
rudiments
of
a
mercantile
education
with
the
correspondent
of
his
house
at
hamburg
this
correspondent
was
known
to
be
a
good
man
of
business
but
he
was
no
more
than
that
and
pinning
his
pupil
down
to
small
details
and
accustoming
him
to
his
own
limited
views
of
commerce
he
narrowed
all
his
habits
of
thought
while
he
gave
vast
development
to
certain
germs
of
selfishness
which
were
in
the
boy
own
nature
his
principles
were
always
to
gain
something
off
every
transaction
never
to
leave
a
penny
unproductive
to
buy
in
the
cheapest
and
sell
in
the
dearest
market
to
look
to
his
pence
knowing
that
his
pounds
would
take
care
of
themselves
and
being
a
merchant
to
regard
everything
with
a
mercantile
eye
he
held
that
no
merchant
should
marry
till
he
could
retire
from
business
indeed
he
regarded
marriage
like
everything
else
as
a
transaction
and
one
quite
incompatible
with
the
conduct
of
a
great
commercial
house
such
lessons
always
have
their
effect
the
pupil
sometimes
going
beyond
sometimes
falling
short
of
his
master
what
were
the
impressions
produced
upon
henry
scriven
will
be
seen
very
soon
but
in
the
mean
time
his
eldest
sister
maria
married
she
made
her
own
choice
and
that
without
ambition
having
any
share
in
it
the
gentleman
whom
she
selected
was
amiable
somewhat
eccentric
but
a
man
of
high
honour
and
much
feeling
he
was
the
second
son
of
one
of
scriven
oldest
friends
and
and
father
had
but
one
objection
it
had
been
arranged
that
henry
marston
was
to
go
out
to
india
with
a
sufficient
capital
to
establish
a
house
in
relation
with
that
of
his
father
in
london
scriven
did
not
like
the
idea
of
his
daughter
going
to
india
at
all
but
he
knew
that
people
are
the
only
judges
of
their
own
happiness
and
as
maria
had
made
up
her
mind
he
threw
no
impediment
in
the
way
shortly
after
henry
scriven
return
from
hamburg
where
he
staid
two
years
the
marriage
of
his
second
sister
isabella
took
place
in
this
instance
there
could
be
no
objection
on
any
part
as
the
man
she
chose
was
just
the
sort
of
person
whom
such
a
girl
might
be
expected
to
prefer
he
was
about
ten
years
older
than
herself
but
remarkably
firm
cheerful
without
being
merry
generous
without
being
extravagant
his
property
was
ample
for
his
father
the
third
baronet
had
left
him
a
large
and
unencumbered
estate
and
his
mother
a
very
considerable
sum
in
the
public
funds
thus
isabella
became
the
wife
of
sir
edward
monkton
but
as
his
property
lay
at
no
great
distance
from
london
her
separation
from
her
family
was
not
so
complete
as
that
of
her
sister
maria
the
youngest
of
the
three
sisters
remained
longer
unmarried
although
she
was
fully
as
attractive
both
in
person
and
manners
as
her
sisters
nor
was
it
that
there
was
a
lack
of
applicants
for
her
hand
for
some
four
or
five
unexceptionable
men
proposed
to
her
and
were
at
once
and
steadily
rejected
much
to
their
own
surprise
and
to
that
of
the
she
was
so
gentle
so
affectionate
so
easily
led
so
for
the
happiness
and
welfare
of
others
that
everybody
had
supposed
her
heart
would
be
carried
at
the
first
assault
perhaps
indeed
it
was
and
this
might
be
the
cause
of
her
remaining
single
to
the
age
of
there
was
at
that
time
moving
in
the
highest
ranks
of
english
society
a
sir
john
fleetwood
who
realized
completely
the
idea
of
a
man
of
wit
and
pleasure
about
town
he
had
served
with
some
distinction
in
the
army
though
he
had
not
seen
more
than
thirty
summers
was
very
handsome
very
lively
with
a
smart
repartee
always
ready
a
slightly
supercilious
air
towards
all
men
but
his
own
choice
companions
and
a
manner
most
engaging
to
all
women
whom
he
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
please
he
had
towards
them
an
easy
familiarity
which
did
not
in
the
least
savour
of
vulgar
impertinence
a
constant
display
of
little
attentions
which
seemed
to
show
that
the
person
who
received
them
was
occupying
all
his
thoughts
a
protecting
kindness
of
tone
with
a
musical
voice
and
a
habit
of
speaking
low
he
danced
with
margaret
the
first
time
she
ever
appeared
at
a
large
party
he
danced
with
her
again
and
then
he
obtained
an
introduction
to
her
father
scriven
received
him
coldly
much
to
the
poor
girl
mortification
it
might
almost
indeed
be
called
repulsively
and
as
he
saw
that
margaret
was
not
only
surprised
by
his
unusual
demeanour
to
her
handsome
partner
but
more
vexed
than
he
could
have
desired
her
father
judged
it
best
to
explain
his
motives
at
once
you
were
astonished
my
love
he
said
as
they
were
driving
home
at
my
coolness
towards
sir
john
fleetwood
but
i
do
not
wish
to
encourage
any
intimacy
between
him
and
any
of
my
family
and
i
wish
to
make
him
feel
at
once
that
it
can
not
be
i
know
him
margaret
to
be
a
bad
man
as
well
as
an
imprudent
man
and
i
should
be
incurring
too
great
a
responsibility
were
i
to
suffer
him
to
visit
at
my
house
he
has
had
every
advantage
in
life
family
fortune
education
and
he
has
misused
them
all
margaret
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
but
then
she
said
how
do
you
wish
me
then
to
behave
to
him
when
we
meet
as
must
often
be
the
case
i
suppose
he
will
certainly
ask
me
to
dance
and
then
i
shall
not
know
how
to
act
after
what
you
have
said
the
customs
of
society
my
dear
child
will
prevent
your
refusing
to
dance
with
him
unless
engaged
to
another
her
father
replied
but
i
should
wish
you
to
be
as
often
engaged
as
possible
and
not
to
suffer
any
approach
to
intimacy
that
you
can
avoid
margaret
to
the
best
of
her
abilities
followed
the
directions
of
her
father
but
she
met
sir
john
fleetwood
often
she
danced
with
him
often
and
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
what
between
nervous
doubts
as
to
how
she
should
behave
on
her
part
and
skill
boldness
and
experience
upon
his
he
did
not
want
opportunities
of
making
progress
in
her
regard
margaret
therefore
remained
unmarried
and
reached
her
year
single
but
less
blessed
than
she
might
well
have
expected
to
be
two
days
after
her
birthday
her
father
went
out
to
ride
in
hyde
park
his
horse
took
fright
ran
away
and
threw
him
scriven
was
brought
home
little
more
than
an
hour
after
he
had
set
out
with
a
compound
fracture
of
the
thigh
the
surgeons
said
that
with
his
strong
constitution
and
equable
temper
there
was
no
danger
and
scriven
spirits
did
not
in
the
least
give
way
three
or
four
days
after
however
mortification
appeared
and
he
then
with
perfect
calmness
informed
the
medical
men
that
he
felt
his
life
was
drawing
to
a
close
they
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
that
such
was
not
the
case
but
there
are
internal
sensations
not
to
be
mistaken
and
scriven
sent
for
his
lawyer
and
a
young
gentleman
of
the
name
of
hayley
who
had
been
placed
in
his
some
seven
or
eight
years
before
by
highly
respectable
but
not
wealthy
relations
hayley
had
conducted
himself
remarkably
well
and
had
risen
to
be
the
chief
clerk
of
scriven
house
he
approached
the
great
merchant
bedside
with
looks
of
sorrowful
concern
and
scriven
after
shaking
hands
with
him
kindly
said
i
have
sent
for
you
my
young
friend
to
give
you
a
little
testimony
both
of
my
gratitude
for
various
services
and
of
my
confidence
in
your
character
i
am
dying
hayley
though
the
surgeons
say
not
and
if
i
die
at
present
henry
my
son
is
not
yet
old
enough
to
manage
entirely
such
large
concerns
as
must
fall
into
his
hands
you
are
acquainted
with
all
the
details
i
owe
you
a
good
deal
for
your
care
attention
and
zeal
in
my
service
and
i
do
not
think
i
can
either
recompense
you
better
or
do
my
son
a
greater
service
than
by
leaving
you
an
eighth
share
of
the
business
which
was
that
portion
bestowed
upon
me
at
my
marriage
there
is
only
one
observation
i
have
to
make
and
do
not
suppose
it
to
imply
censure
but
merely
warning
though
born
of
a
race
of
gentlemen
it
is
very
necessary
for
you
to
remember
that
you
are
especially
a
merchant
to
that
consideration
you
should
sacrifice
much
and
it
you
should
sacrifice
to
nothing
your
education
at
a
public
school
has
given
you
several
acquaintances
of
a
higher
class
of
society
than
our
own
and
some
of
very
expensive
habits
i
am
told
friendships
are
too
valuable
to
be
given
up
but
no
examples
are
worthy
of
being
followed
but
those
of
honour
virtue
and
truth
i
can
assure
you
sir
replied
hayley
i
have
preserved
none
of
my
school
acquaintances
of
a
higher
rank
than
my
own
except
that
of
lord
mellent
son
of
the
earl
of
milford
we
were
first
at
a
private
school
together
then
at
eton
in
the
same
form
and
it
would
i
acknowledge
be
a
most
painful
sacrifice
to
give
up
his
friendship
with
greater
means
than
myself
he
is
of
course
able
to
maintain
a
much
more
expensive
style
of
living
but
i
trust
you
have
never
observed
anything
in
me
which
should
induce
you
to
suppose
i
affect
to
rival
him
or
even
to
join
him
in
any
extravagance
however
i
feel
as
deeply
indebted
to
you
for
your
advice
as
even
for
your
kind
intentions
towards
me
the
one
shall
be
remembered
as
a
guide
to
my
conduct
and
i
do
still
hope
and
pray
that
it
may
be
long
very
long
before
the
latter
receives
execution
perhaps
had
scriven
been
at
all
a
suspicious
man
he
might
have
thought
his
reply
too
neat
and
rounded
but
ill
as
he
was
and
by
nature
generous
in
his
appreciation
of
other
men
motives
he
was
well
satisfied
his
anticipations
however
regarding
his
own
fate
were
but
too
surely
realized
three
days
after
this
conversation
his
eyes
were
closed
for
ever
and
his
son
succeeded
to
a
large
property
and
found
himself
at
the
head
of
a
firm
hardly
rivalled
by
any
in
the
world
with
the
habits
of
thought
which
he
had
acquired
the
possession
of
so
much
wealth
and
of
such
vast
means
of
increasing
it
served
to
close
rather
than
open
the
heart
he
felt
an
awful
responsibility
of
getting
money
upon
him
and
of
preserving
what
he
had
got
and
all
his
first
acts
indicated
sufficiently
what
would
be
his
future
course
those
who
were
observers
of
human
nature
remarked
if
young
scriven
is
so
close
and
grasping
as
a
mere
lad
what
will
he
be
as
age
creeps
upon
him
and
those
who
had
perhaps
calculated
upon
gaining
some
advantages
over
the
son
which
they
had
not
been
able
to
obtain
over
the
father
soon
gave
up
the
attempt
and
regretted
the
change
henry
scriven
first
step
was
to
discharge
all
his
father
old
servants
and
to
pay
all
legacies
though
he
did
not
scruple
to
say
that
he
thought
his
sisters
had
been
somewhat
too
liberally
provided
for
he
then
sold
the
house
in
james
square
as
requiring
a
larger
establishment
than
was
necessary
for
a
young
man
and
he
retired
to
a
lodging
in
brook
street
comfortable
enough
but
greatly
within
his
means
he
was
much
annoyed
at
the
bequest
of
an
eighth
share
of
his
father
business
to
hayley
but
he
took
advantage
of
all
that
gentleman
knowledge
and
hayley
soon
by
mild
almost
timid
manners
and
active
services
contrived
to
ingratiate
himself
as
far
as
possible
with
a
not
very
generous
person
in
the
mean
time
margaret
viewing
with
wonder
and
disapproval
all
her
brother
conduct
retired
for
three
months
to
the
house
of
her
sister
isabella
and
then
went
for
some
time
on
a
visit
to
a
friend
before
she
returned
a
letter
announced
to
scriven
and
lady
monkton
that
their
sister
was
about
to
bestow
her
hand
upon
sir
john
fleetwood
and
as
soon
as
she
came
back
to
london
the
baronet
pressed
eagerly
for
the
consummation
of
his
happiness
isabella
with
knowledge
of
the
world
and
strong
good
sense
saw
as
her
father
had
seen
unanswerable
objections
to
the
marriage
and
she
urged
them
strongly
though
kindly
upon
her
sister
attention
but
she
soon
found
that
to
urge
them
was
labour
in
vain
margaret
admitted
that
she
knew
her
lover
had
been
what
was
then
and
still
is
called
a
gay
man
and
moreover
an
extravagant
one
but
she
assured
her
friends
that
he
was
reformed
in
both
respects
and
that
she
looked
upon
it
as
a
duty
to
aid
as
far
as
was
in
her
power
to
complete
the
happy
change
lady
monkton
wisely
abandoned
the
task
of
opposition
and
hoped
but
did
not
believe
that
the
reformation
would
last
scriven
attached
himself
to
one
object
to
ensure
that
his
sister
large
fortune
should
be
settled
upon
herself
and
in
this
he
would
probably
have
succeeded
if
margaret
would
have
consented
even
for
a
few
short
days
not
to
see
her
lover
or
would
have
steadily
referred
all
matters
of
business
to
her
brother
unfortunately
however
margaret
had
lost
confidence
in
him
who
was
now
really
striving
for
her
good
and
she
would
not
trust
to
his
generosity
while
she
was
inclined
to
place
the
fullest
reliance
on
one
whose
selfishness
was
only
of
a
more
sparkling
kind
all
that
scriven
could
accomplish
was
to
have
seven
hundred
and
a
house
settled
upon
his
sister
though
she
brought
her
husband
three
thousand
per
annum
but
that
small
sum
he
took
care
so
to
tie
up
that
no
after
weakness
on
her
own
part
could
deprive
her
of
at
least
a
moderate
independence
sir
john
fleetwood
after
the
deed
was
signed
laughed
with
a
gay
companion
and
observed
that
harry
scriven
was
the
best
man
of
business
in
england
and
on
the
following
day
margaret
became
his
wife
the
after
fate
of
all
the
family
shall
be
briefly
told
in
the
succeeding
chapter
chapter
ii
where
is
the
family
in
which
the
retrospect
of
ten
years
will
not
present
a
sad
and
chilling
record
with
the
open
tomb
around
whose
verge
we
play
and
the
yawning
gulf
of
fate
which
stands
ever
ready
to
swallow
up
the
bright
hopes
and
joys
of
early
life
maturity
and
decay
shake
hands
in
the
family
of
scriven
many
changes
had
taken
place
during
that
space
of
time
flowers
had
blossomed
and
been
blighted
expectations
had
passed
away
which
were
once
fair
sorrow
had
shadowed
some
happy
faces
death
had
not
spared
them
any
more
than
others
but
i
must
trace
the
history
of
each
though
it
shall
be
very
briefly
the
only
one
of
the
four
children
of
the
merchant
who
had
undergone
few
vicissitudes
who
had
known
but
little
change
and
that
merely
progressive
was
the
son
henry
scriven
was
the
same
man
ten
years
older
he
laid
himself
open
to
few
of
the
attacks
of
fate
he
had
neither
wife
nor
children
his
fortress
was
small
and
therefore
easily
defended
he
had
made
money
and
therefore
he
loved
it
all
the
better
he
had
lost
money
and
therefore
he
was
more
careful
both
in
getting
and
keeping
it
the
circles
round
his
heart
went
on
concentrating
not
expanding
and
were
narrowed
to
a
point
even
in
business
this
was
discovered
by
those
who
had
to
deal
with
him
people
said
that
the
house
of
scriven
and
was
a
hard
house
but
still
everyone
pronounced
scriven
a
very
honourable
man
though
he
did
sundry
very
dirty
tricks
but
he
was
known
to
be
a
rich
man
and
his
business
most
extensive
did
you
never
remark
reader
that
a
wealthy
man
or
a
wealthy
firm
is
always
very
honourable
in
the
world
opinion
i
have
known
a
body
of
rich
men
do
things
that
would
have
branded
an
inferior
establishment
with
everlasting
disgrace
or
have
sent
an
unfriended
and
unpursed
vagabond
across
the
seas
and
yet
i
have
been
boldly
told
it
is
a
highly
honourable
house
so
it
was
in
a
degree
with
scriven
but
still
he
was
careful
of
his
character
he
never
did
anything
very
gross
anything
that
could
be
detected
and
though
all
admitted
that
he
was
very
close
and
somewhat
grasping
people
found
excuses
for
him
some
thought
he
would
build
hospitals
even
his
very
nearest
and
his
dearest
knew
him
not
fully
and
did
not
perceive
what
were
the
real
bonds
which
kept
his
actions
in
an
even
and
respectable
course
it
is
wonderful
how
many
persons
women
and
men
are
restrained
by
fear
maria
scriven
had
accompanied
as
i
have
said
her
husband
marston
to
india
and
there
as
far
as
worldly
matters
went
they
were
very
prosperous
still
they
had
their
griefs
who
has
not
their
eldest
child
was
a
boy
whom
they
named
charles
and
a
stronger
finer
little
fellow
never
was
seen
her
letters
were
full
of
him
but
the
second
child
was
lost
when
a
few
months
old
and
the
third
did
not
survive
its
birth
a
year
maria
own
health
also
suffered
from
the
climate
and
with
much
pain
it
was
resolved
that
she
should
return
to
europe
with
her
boy
marston
was
to
rejoin
them
at
the
end
of
three
years
but
human
calculations
are
vain
when
maria
reached
england
she
was
carried
from
the
ship
to
the
shore
and
thence
by
slow
journeys
to
london
for
she
was
very
she
revived
a
little
in
her
native
air
but
the
improvement
was
not
permanent
and
she
died
about
two
months
after
her
arrival
her
husband
great
inducement
for
revisiting
the
land
of
his
birth
was
gone
and
leaving
his
son
to
the
care
of
his
he
remained
plodding
on
in
india
lady
monkton
had
her
share
of
sorrows
too
her
first
three
children
died
in
infancy
they
were
all
bright
blooming
beautiful
health
and
long
life
seemed
written
on
their
fair
faces
but
the
battle
is
not
to
the
strong
nor
the
race
to
the
swift
and
one
or
other
of
those
maladies
of
childhood
which
often
make
a
cheerful
household
desolate
had
swept
away
the
whole
successively
isabella
gay
happy
as
she
was
quailed
under
these
repeated
blows
she
was
too
firm
and
sensible
to
yield
entirely
but
a
shade
of
sadness
came
over
her
once
clear
brow
and
when
a
fourth
child
appeared
it
was
with
some
awe
she
watched
its
infancy
this
child
was
a
daughter
more
delicate
to
all
appearance
than
the
others
but
when
illness
fell
upon
her
it
was
comparatively
light
and
with
years
health
and
strength
seemed
to
increase
the
fair
fragile
form
developed
itself
with
a
thousand
graces
the
bloom
came
upon
the
cheek
the
soft
languid
eyes
grew
bright
and
gay
and
hour
by
hour
hope
and
confidence
returned
there
was
still
a
terrible
shock
in
store
however
one
day
sir
edward
monkton
returned
from
a
ride
very
wet
was
detained
by
a
person
he
found
waiting
for
him
on
business
was
seized
with
shivering
during
the
night
and
inflammation
of
the
lungs
succeeded
five
days
of
watching
and
terror
left
her
a
widow
with
a
heart
the
very
firmness
of
which
rendered
its
affections
the
more
enduring
character
had
not
fully
displayed
itself
to
the
eyes
of
sir
edward
monkton
he
knew
him
to
be
a
good
man
of
business
and
believed
him
to
be
an
honourable
and
upright
man
even
lady
monkton
did
not
know
her
brother
thoroughly
and
she
was
glad
to
have
him
joined
with
herself
as
the
executor
of
her
husband
will
and
the
guardian
of
her
daughter
she
soon
found
cause
for
some
regret
that
it
was
so
for
his
arrangements
did
not
altogether
please
her
but
still
there
was
not
much
to
complain
of
and
at
the
end
of
the
ten
years
which
followed
her
father
death
she
was
living
peacefully
at
her
house
in
hertfordshire
about
fifteen
miles
from
london
occupied
with
the
education
of
her
daughter
maria
seeing
very
little
society
dwelling
calmly
though
gravely
upon
the
past
and
looking
forward
with
hope
and
consolation
to
the
future
one
of
the
greatest
anxieties
which
lady
monkton
felt
at
this
time
and
they
were
anxieties
which
amounted
to
grief
proceeded
from
the
circumstances
of
her
sister
margaret
sir
john
fleetwood
had
turned
out
all
that
scriven
had
anticipated
reckless
extravagant
licentious
his
whole
thought
and
occupation
seemed
to
be
how
he
might
soon
run
through
his
own
property
and
that
part
of
his
wife
fortune
over
which
he
had
control
he
was
very
successful
in
his
endeavours
what
bad
associates
male
and
female
did
not
contrive
to
dissipate
soon
enough
cards
dice
and
horses
succeeded
in
losing
and
at
length
he
endeavoured
to
get
rid
of
his
settlement
she
would
willingly
have
given
it
up
to
please
him
for
though
he
had
been
a
negligent
and
offending
husband
yet
so
long
as
money
lasted
he
had
always
been
gay
and
with
her
treating
her
more
as
an
innocent
and
unsuspecting
child
than
as
a
companion
but
scriven
had
taken
care
of
his
sister
income
it
could
not
be
touched
even
with
her
own
consent
no
creditor
had
power
over
it
her
own
receipt
was
necessary
for
every
penny
of
the
income
and
being
settled
upon
her
children
though
she
had
none
it
was
inviolable
sir
john
had
not
clearly
perceived
these
stringent
conditions
when
he
signed
the
deed
and
some
sharp
discussions
took
place
between
him
and
his
he
became
gloomy
morose
fretful
and
still
he
would
appear
at
ascot
or
at
the
though
he
could
no
longer
maintain
the
appearance
which
he
had
once
displayed
it
was
at
the
former
of
these
places
that
a
dispute
took
place
between
himself
and
another
gentleman
the
it
matters
not
much
to
this
work
which
was
wrong
or
which
was
right
and
indeed
i
do
not
know
hard
epithets
were
exchanged
and
sir
john
employed
a
horsewhip
not
for
its
most
legitimate
purpose
two
mornings
after
he
was
brought
home
in
a
dying
state
with
a
through
his
lungs
and
never
uttered
a
word
during
the
he
continued
to
exist
it
must
have
been
an
awful
for
it
was
clear
that
his
senses
and
his
memory
were
all
still
perfect
and
what
a
picture
memory
must
have
shown
him
poor
lady
fleetwood
was
in
despair
her
love
had
never
failed
nor
even
diminished
she
had
never
admitted
his
faults
even
to
herself
or
at
all
events
had
found
excuses
for
them
in
her
kind
and
affectionate
heart
now
that
he
was
gone
she
was
still
less
likely
to
discover
them
for
bitter
sorrow
drew
a
veil
between
her
eyes
and
all
that
might
have
shocked
her
in
the
conduct
of
the
dead
it
is
true
there
was
one
thing
could
not
be
concealed
from
her
that
he
had
wasted
every
penny
of
his
own
property
and
of
hers
too
as
far
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
do
so
but
then
she
fancied
that
he
had
been
only
unfortunate
and
doubted
not
that
had
he
lived
all
would
have
been
set
right
her
brother
scriven
tried
hard
in
his
cold
dry
way
to
open
her
eyes
but
he
only
wrung
her
heart
without
convincing
her
and
though
she
both
feared
and
respected
him
he
could
never
induce
her
to
admit
that
her
husband
had
acted
lady
monkton
with
tenderer
feelings
never
attempted
to
undeceive
her
but
brought
her
at
once
to
bolton
park
and
there
tried
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
nor
was
she
unsuccessful
her
own
calm
and
quiet
demeanour
somewhat
touched
with
grief
but
yet
not
melancholy
the
gay
and
cheerful
company
of
her
little
girl
maria
and
the
occasional
society
of
her
next
neighbours
lord
mellent
and
his
wife
a
somewhat
indolent
but
amiable
and
lively
woman
gradually
restored
lady
fleetwood
to
composure
and
resignation
her
greatest
solace
indeed
was
her
niece
maria
for
though
enthusiastically
fond
of
children
she
had
had
none
herself
and
now
the
gay
happy
girl
about
ten
years
old
addressed
herself
with
more
thought
and
feeling
than
might
have
been
expected
of
a
child
to
amuse
her
widowed
aunt
and
win
her
mind
from
sad
thoughts
and
memories
maria
young
companion
too
anne
mellent
the
daughter
of
their
neighbours
though
of
a
different
character
from
maria
quick
decided
independent
in
her
ways
was
always
exceedingly
tender
and
gentle
to
lady
fleetwood
and
from
time
to
time
another
was
added
to
their
society
whom
they
all
knew
and
all
loved
though
he
was
at
this
time
not
above
thirteen
years
of
age
but
of
him
and
his
family
i
must
speak
apart
as
although
it
was
intimately
connected
by
circumstances
with
that
of
scriven
it
was
not
allied
to
it
either
by
blood
or
marriage
chapter
iii
in
mentioning
the
circumstances
which
attended
the
death
of
the
great
merchant
i
have
spoken
of
a
young
gentleman
of
the
name
of
hayley
who
when
his
family
fell
into
adverse
circumstances
had
been
placed
in
scriven
house
as
a
clerk
and
had
risen
by
good
conduct
and
attention
to
be
the
chief
clerk
in
the
he
was
still
under
thirty
when
his
friend
and
patron
died
and
as
i
have
said
received
as
a
recompense
for
his
services
an
eighth
share
in
the
house
perhaps
enough
has
been
displayed
of
his
character
to
enable
the
reader
to
estimate
it
justly
and
i
will
only
add
that
he
was
of
a
gentle
yielding
almost
timid
disposition
although
it
might
perhaps
have
been
somewhat
fiery
and
eager
as
indeed
it
had
seemed
at
school
had
not
early
misfortunes
and
long
drudgery
broken
his
spirit
and
cowed
the
stronger
passions
within
him
it
is
not
an
uncommon
case
during
the
time
that
he
remained
a
clerk
and
for
a
year
after
he
became
a
partner
in
the
house
hayley
lived
as
a
single
man
with
an
unmarried
sister
somewhat
older
than
himself
in
a
small
house
in
one
of
those
suburban
quarters
of
the
town
where
people
fancy
they
get
country
air
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
one
day
brought
home
with
him
a
fine
little
boy
of
two
years
old
very
much
indeed
to
the
surprise
of
his
sister
some
explanation
was
of
course
necessary
as
well
as
many
new
arrangements
but
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
a
strange
degree
of
reserve
seemed
to
have
fallen
over
hayley
he
would
tell
his
sister
part
but
not
the
whole
he
said
in
answer
to
her
anxious
inquiries
he
did
not
affect
to
deny
that
the
child
was
his
son
but
he
desired
that
he
might
not
be
questioned
at
all
about
the
boy
mother
and
seemed
annoyed
at
the
least
allusion
to
the
circumstance
of
birth
now
miss
hayley
was
as
affectionate
a
creature
as
ever
drank
in
the
milk
of
human
kindness
from
the
gentle
air
of
heaven
and
she
was
devotedly
attached
to
her
brother
but
she
was
proud
of
him
too
and
she
had
very
strong
peculiarities
and
also
a
strong
and
quick
temper
which
is
not
unfrequently
joined
to
a
heart
soft
even
to
weakness
she
was
not
satisfied
with
the
information
she
had
received
she
thought
her
brother
did
not
place
sufficient
confidence
in
her
and
after
considering
the
matter
for
some
hours
she
took
her
resolution
and
with
an
air
of
grave
dignity
went
down
to
the
room
where
hayley
was
seated
looking
over
some
papers
stephen
she
said
i
want
to
speak
with
you
for
a
moment
well
my
dear
rebecca
what
is
it
asked
her
brother
hardly
looking
up
i
must
know
more
about
this
little
boy
said
his
sister
i
must
indeed
request
you
not
to
trouble
me
or
yourself
said
hayley
with
unwonted
sharpness
about
what
does
not
concern
you
miss
hayley
fired
up
instantly
she
insisted
that
it
did
concern
her
very
much
and
the
sharpest
dispute
took
place
between
herself
and
her
brother
that
had
ever
occurred
in
their
lives
it
ended
by
her
declaring
that
if
he
did
not
satisfy
her
at
least
upon
one
point
she
would
leave
his
house
and
by
his
telling
her
that
she
was
at
liberty
to
do
so
very
well
assured
be
it
remarked
that
she
would
not
she
turned
to
the
door
however
with
such
a
look
of
determination
that
hayley
became
a
little
alarmed
and
he
called
her
back
now
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
rebecca
he
asked
you
say
one
point
that
must
of
course
be
a
point
of
consequence
for
i
think
you
would
not
quarrel
with
me
for
a
trifle
or
for
anything
that
does
not
actually
concern
you
what
is
it
miss
hayley
paused
for
a
moment
for
she
had
come
with
an
intention
of
making
him
tell
all
and
when
driven
from
the
broader
ground
by
his
resolute
resistance
had
not
exactly
the
point
on
which
to
make
her
last
stand
is
the
child
legitimate
or
illegitimate
she
asked
at
length
he
was
born
in
lawful
wedlock
answered
her
brother
and
the
mother
inquired
his
sister
that
is
not
fair
rebecca
said
hayley
you
declared
that
you
would
be
satisfied
with
explanation
on
one
point
now
you
require
more
however
i
will
satisfy
you
on
this
head
also
upon
the
clear
understanding
that
i
hear
not
one
word
more
upon
the
subject
now
or
ever
do
you
agree
yes
then
i
shall
be
content
answered
she
but
on
these
two
matters
i
have
a
right
to
information
for
i
am
not
going
to
there
there
i
want
not
your
reasons
exclaimed
her
brother
interrupting
her
upon
that
understanding
then
i
tell
you
his
mother
is
dead
poor
little
fellow
has
been
dead
for
some
months
and
i
should
have
brought
him
home
before
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
anticipation
of
all
this
fuss
and
explanation
you
may
therefore
tell
any
impertinent
person
who
inquires
that
henry
is
my
son
by
a
private
marriage
and
that
his
mother
is
dead
very
well
replied
miss
hayley
with
an
offended
air
for
she
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
the
she
had
received
when
she
thought
that
she
had
a
right
to
the
whole
story
and
she
walked
dignifiedly
out
of
the
room
when
she
got
up
to
the
she
found
the
boy
playing
about
upon
the
floor
under
the
charge
of
one
of
the
maids
and
she
had
a
strong
inclination
to
sulk
a
little
even
with
the
child
she
found
it
impossible
however
he
would
not
let
her
her
own
heart
would
not
let
her
and
in
three
days
she
was
doing
her
best
to
spoil
him
completely
she
tried
to
draw
from
him
for
he
could
speak
very
nicely
some
of
those
facts
which
her
brother
had
withheld
or
at
least
a
clue
to
them
she
questioned
him
regarding
his
mamma
but
the
little
fellow
stoutly
maintained
he
had
never
had
a
mamma
asserting
that
nurse
johnston
was
the
only
mamma
he
had
ever
had
and
she
was
not
his
mamma
either
for
his
papa
had
told
him
so
the
next
thing
was
to
ascertain
if
possible
where
he
had
previously
lived
but
of
that
the
boy
could
tell
her
nothing
but
that
it
was
a
great
great
way
off
had
taken
a
long
time
to
travel
thence
which
was
afterwards
reduced
to
two
or
three
hours
and
that
the
house
had
a
garden
and
was
opposite
to
a
all
that
she
could
arrive
at
was
that
the
boy
first
recollections
were
of
being
dressed
in
a
white
frock
with
black
ribbons
and
sometimes
having
on
a
frock
altogether
of
the
same
sombre
colour
in
time
curiosity
died
away
and
simple
love
for
the
dear
boy
succeeded
proper
arrangements
for
his
careful
education
were
made
a
nurse
was
hired
his
letters
were
learnt
hayley
seemed
to
dote
upon
him
and
miss
hayley
actually
did
so
for
a
more
engaging
child
never
was
seen
kind
gentle
docile
yet
playful
bold
and
frank
in
the
mean
while
a
house
had
been
hired
in
a
more
fashionable
situation
the
number
of
servants
was
increased
a
better
style
of
living
assumed
and
even
scriven
admitted
that
hayley
was
a
very
prudent
man
who
had
waited
to
see
the
extent
of
his
means
before
he
at
all
increased
his
expenditure
scriven
was
not
an
inquisitive
man
he
was
accustomed
to
say
that
he
had
too
many
affairs
of
his
own
to
allow
him
to
mind
other
people
and
he
saw
the
little
addition
to
hayley
family
without
much
comment
or
inquiry
he
was
well
satisfied
with
the
assurance
which
his
partner
gave
him
in
answer
to
the
only
questions
he
did
put
that
he
never
intended
to
marry
again
and
he
even
seemed
pleased
with
and
fond
of
the
little
boy
whom
he
frequently
saw
as
pleased
with
and
as
fond
of
him
as
he
could
be
of
anything
but
money
when
little
charles
marston
was
left
under
his
charge
indeed
by
his
sister
death
and
her
husband
absence
he
naturally
became
more
attached
to
his
young
relation
nevertheless
he
often
had
little
henry
hayley
to
play
with
his
nephew
and
the
two
boys
became
inseparable
as
they
grew
up
henry
manners
and
disposition
won
his
way
everywhere
and
he
was
looked
upon
almost
as
one
of
the
family
by
lady
fleetwood
and
lady
monkton
at
bolton
park
he
was
always
a
most
welcome
guest
and
a
fondness
which
might
have
alarmed
some
mothers
who
had
ambitious
views
for
their
daughters
arose
and
increased
from
day
to
day
between
him
and
maria
monkton
who
was
but
a
few
years
younger
in
the
mean
time
hayley
style
of
living
became
gradually
a
good
deal
more
expensive
and
that
taste
for
high
society
which
the
elder
scriven
had
remarked
showed
itself
more
strongly
with
his
altered
circumstances
the
names
of
several
noblemen
were
added
to
that
of
lord
mellent
on
his
list
of
friends
and
rumour
said
that
he
occasionally
lent
money
to
the
more
needy
of
his
fashionable
acquaintances
still
his
intimacy
with
his
former
friend
and
schoolfellow
continued
unabated
lady
mellent
who
was
herself
the
daughter
of
a
banker
readily
adopted
her
husband
feelings
towards
him
and
hayley
was
generally
a
guest
at
their
house
on
the
saturday
and
sunday
after
having
seen
their
friend
little
boy
once
or
twice
at
lady
monkton
house
the
noble
lord
and
his
lady
were
as
fascinated
with
him
as
others
had
been
and
the
next
time
hayley
came
down
to
harley
lodge
he
was
asked
to
bring
his
son
with
him
the
invitation
was
repeated
till
it
became
customary
and
till
he
was
ten
years
of
age
each
saturday
saw
henry
a
guest
at
lord
mellent
house
and
the
companion
of
his
daughter
nothing
to
please
or
to
instruct
was
spared
upon
the
boy
by
hayley
he
was
determined
he
said
not
to
send
him
to
a
private
school
and
consequently
masters
were
engaged
to
teach
all
sorts
of
rudimental
knowledge
at
home
he
had
his
pony
too
and
a
groom
was
generally
ready
to
go
out
with
him
but
it
was
remarked
that
whenever
he
got
away
from
his
lessons
early
he
was
soon
on
the
road
to
bolton
park
and
roaming
about
with
maria
in
her
at
length
the
period
arrived
for
sending
him
to
eton
and
now
of
course
he
was
only
seen
during
the
holidays
by
his
young
companions
except
by
charles
marston
who
followed
him
six
months
after
both
boys
distinguished
themselves
a
good
deal
at
school
but
henry
abilities
were
decidedly
higher
or
his
application
greater
nor
was
this
produced
by
any
want
of
those
inducements
to
inattention
which
rich
and
fond
parents
often
supply
to
their
children
for
hayley
was
a
very
indulgent
father
and
the
allowance
that
he
made
to
his
son
was
more
than
ample
at
least
during
the
first
three
years
of
henry
stay
indulgence
did
not
seem
to
spoil
him
on
only
two
occasions
and
they
were
both
honourable
to
him
did
he
go
beyond
the
strict
limit
of
what
was
allowed
him
and
his
attachment
and
devotion
to
a
father
who
showed
him
such
tender
kindness
were
unbounded
the
course
pursued
however
was
undoubtedly
foolish
hayley
had
not
made
a
fortune
it
was
still
to
make
and
his
towards
his
son
in
matters
of
expense
generated
habits
which
could
only
be
kept
up
in
after
life
by
a
very
wealthy
man
during
the
period
of
the
holidays
the
gay
happy
lad
was
still
a
frequent
guest
at
bolton
park
and
harley
lodge
he
was
very
tall
finely
formed
and
of
a
remarkably
handsome
and
expressive
countenance
older
both
in
look
and
in
manner
than
his
years
and
yet
with
all
the
grace
and
frankness
of
boyhood
unimpaired
there
was
something
noble
and
even
proud
about
his
look
too
although
he
was
as
gentle
as
the
spring
and
if
considering
his
youth
his
habits
were
expensive
he
could
hardly
be
blamed
seeing
that
hayley
did
nothing
to
restrain
them
and
his
aunt
whose
fondness
for
him
had
now
grown
to
a
pitch
of
extravagance
did
everything
that
excessive
indulgence
could
do
to
encourage
them
he
had
but
to
ask
and
to
have
and
as
he
had
never
been
taught
the
value
of
money
of
course
it
had
no
value
in
his
eyes
the
period
at
which
youth
puts
on
manhood
varies
very
much
in
different
individuals
and
henry
hayley
looked
and
was
two
years
nearer
maturity
at
fourteen
than
his
young
companion
charles
marston
who
was
not
quite
a
year
younger
nevertheless
lady
monkton
always
saw
him
the
companion
of
her
daughter
with
pleasure
she
let
things
take
their
course
and
did
not
even
think
fit
to
foresee
a
time
when
the
intimacy
must
receive
a
check
this
very
unworldly
view
depended
upon
her
own
character
though
a
sensible
girl
and
a
very
sensible
woman
she
had
never
had
the
slightest
share
of
ambition
she
considered
that
happiness
consists
of
happiness
which
simple
as
the
conclusion
may
seem
is
a
view
that
very
few
people
indeed
take
she
did
not
believe
that
she
would
have
been
in
the
slightest
degree
happier
with
her
own
husband
if
he
had
been
a
peer
she
was
sure
she
should
not
have
been
less
happy
if
he
had
been
a
merchant
and
she
left
maria
to
choose
for
herself
without
the
slightest
precaution
as
to
how
she
might
choose
except
inasmuch
as
she
resolved
that
she
should
never
have
the
opportunity
if
she
could
prevent
it
of
choosing
a
sir
john
fleetwood
not
so
however
lady
mellent
who
became
somewhat
uneasy
at
young
henry
hayley
constant
association
with
her
daughter
it
is
true
that
she
was
only
ten
years
of
age
it
is
true
that
the
lad
boyish
prepossessions
were
evidently
in
favour
of
maria
monkton
but
still
she
thought
it
right
to
represent
to
lord
mellent
that
henry
was
really
growing
quite
a
young
man
that
boyish
intimacies
often
ripened
into
more
tender
feelings
that
as
anne
grew
up
it
would
not
do
to
have
such
a
thing
as
an
attachment
even
reported
between
her
and
young
hayley
with
a
number
of
the
usual
etceteras
but
her
representations
had
not
the
least
effect
upon
lord
mellent
henry
was
now
his
great
favourite
he
took
him
out
to
shoot
with
him
he
mounted
him
he
took
him
out
to
hunt
and
he
never
was
happier
than
when
the
lad
was
with
him
his
society
also
was
of
great
advantage
to
henry
hayley
for
though
lord
mellent
had
in
his
young
days
been
both
an
extravagant
and
a
somewhat
dissipated
man
yet
there
was
at
bottom
a
fund
of
strong
good
sense
and
high
principle
in
his
character
which
had
shown
itself
in
a
complete
change
of
habits
and
pursuits
after
his
marriage
in
the
casting
off
of
all
dissolute
associates
and
the
abandonment
of
all
evil
or
dangerous
customs
lady
mellent
felt
a
little
piqued
perhaps
at
her
husband
great
fondness
for
the
handsome
boy
she
felt
sure
and
perhaps
not
unreasonably
that
lord
mellent
regretted
he
had
not
a
son
such
as
henry
hayley
but
she
was
too
and
too
indolent
to
press
her
opinions
after
they
had
once
been
expressed
and
everything
went
on
as
before
thus
all
matters
proceeded
till
henry
returned
from
eton
for
the
summer
holidays
when
he
was
somewhat
more
than
fifteen
years
of
age
but
on
his
arrival
at
his
father
house
he
found
a
great
change
had
worked
itself
during
his
last
absence
hayley
was
gloomy
and
depressed
miss
hayley
was
evidently
uneasy
though
a
fitful
and
excessive
cheerfulness
was
assumed
to
cover
care
and
thought
no
explanation
was
given
him
and
on
the
second
day
after
his
arrival
finding
that
even
his
presence
which
usually
spread
sunshine
around
and
all
his
efforts
to
please
and
amuse
which
never
before
had
been
unsuccessful
failed
to
cheer
his
home
he
betook
himself
to
call
upon
his
young
companion
charles
marston
charles
was
out
he
had
gone
down
to
his
uncle
the
servant
said
and
thither
henry
followed
to
ask
him
if
he
would
ride
to
bolton
park
he
did
not
find
him
in
the
city
but
he
met
with
scriven
who
was
particularly
kind
to
him
asked
after
his
progress
in
his
studies
inquired
especially
into
his
knowledge
of
arithmetic
and
questioned
him
as
to
how
he
should
like
to
be
a
merchant
nay
more
having
a
little
time
to
spare
he
gave
him
some
of
his
own
views
of
commercial
matters
and
seemed
anxious
to
impress
him
favourably
with
the
pursuits
in
which
his
own
life
was
entirely
spent
it
was
really
kind
and
he
intended
it
to
be
so
the
lady
did
not
much
like
the
subject
but
with
his
usual
sense
of
propriety
he
listened
with
attention
looked
at
some
books
which
scriven
showed
him
and
though
he
did
not
express
any
great
liking
for
a
mercantile
life
replied
gaily
that
he
doubted
not
he
should
soon
bend
himself
to
any
course
which
his
father
thought
fit
for
him
to
follow
a
certain
feeling
of
shyness
he
knew
not
well
why
prevented
him
from
turning
his
horse
head
towards
bolton
park
without
charles
marston
but
he
had
no
such
feelings
in
riding
to
harley
lodge
there
however
he
learned
that
lord
mellent
had
been
for
some
weeks
in
the
north
of
england
attending
upon
his
father
who
was
dangerously
ill
and
after
having
lunched
gaily
with
lady
mellent
and
her
daughter
he
rode
back
to
london
and
went
to
call
upon
lady
fleetwood
who
had
by
this
time
taken
up
her
abode
in
a
small
house
in
london
here
for
the
first
time
henry
hayley
was
informed
of
the
real
situation
of
his
father
lady
fleetwood
was
the
best
creature
in
the
world
and
the
best
creature
in
the
world
is
always
anxious
to
comfort
everybody
that
requires
comforting
it
very
often
happens
indeed
that
the
objects
of
this
kind
influence
do
not
know
that
they
need
it
and
then
the
effect
of
the
effort
is
generally
the
reverse
of
what
was
intended
lady
fleetwood
with
the
best
intentions
began
the
process
by
assuring
her
young
friend
that
she
was
very
sorry
indeed
for
the
differences
between
her
brother
and
hayley
the
whole
family
were
very
sorry
and
had
long
hoped
that
it
might
be
made
up
but
that
her
brother
had
always
been
very
firm
lady
fleetwood
would
not
call
it
obstinate
though
that
was
what
she
meant
to
imply
but
she
was
a
woman
of
soft
words
who
never
used
a
harsh
expression
in
her
life
however
her
consolations
showed
henry
hayley
that
there
was
something
in
his
situation
which
needed
consolation
and
he
proceeded
to
ascertain
from
lady
fleetwood
what
it
was
in
regard
to
keeping
a
secret
it
was
a
thing
which
lady
fleetwood
did
not
often
succeed
in
effecting
though
she
sometimes
attempted
it
and
henry
soon
learned
that
scriven
having
heard
or
discovered
or
suspected
that
hayley
occasionally
frequented
a
fashionable
had
about
two
months
before
insisted
upon
an
immediate
dissolution
of
partnership
the
accounts
were
even
then
in
course
of
settlement
lady
fleetwood
told
him
and
she
added
that
she
was
very
sorry
to
hear
hayley
was
likely
to
be
greatly
embarrassed
by
this
business
as
some
speculations
on
his
own
private
account
had
proved
unsuccessful
she
could
not
understand
it
she
said
for
she
knew
nothing
of
business
but
she
recollected
quite
well
having
heard
her
brother
say
at
the
time
of
her
father
death
that
the
eighth
share
of
the
business
was
worth
more
than
thirty
thousand
pounds
henry
hayley
left
her
with
a
heart
terribly
depressed
he
felt
himself
compelled
to
think
and
think
deeply
for
the
first
time
in
life
and
that
very
fact
proved
depressing
when
we
first
learn
that
the
flowers
of
the
garden
which
this
world
generally
is
to
youth
are
doomed
to
wither
by
seeing
the
fair
frail
things
fade
and
fall
the
heart
feels
faint
with
apprehension
lest
they
should
never
bloom
again
nor
others
rise
up
in
their
places
but
the
mind
of
the
lad
was
a
powerful
one
disposed
for
thought
and
apt
for
action
my
father
is
ruined
he
thought
and
perhaps
his
indulgence
to
me
may
have
contributed
to
involve
him
more
than
of
the
at
eton
were
not
allowed
to
spend
nearly
as
much
as
i
was
and
none
more
then
came
the
thought
what
can
i
do
to
help
him
it
was
a
difficult
question
for
a
boy
to
answer
but
henry
brooded
over
it
everything
he
saw
at
home
showed
him
that
his
conclusions
in
regard
to
hayley
circumstances
were
but
too
just
all
matters
were
going
amiss
and
his
father
gloom
was
not
to
be
mistaken
the
young
lad
pondered
and
meditated
in
his
own
room
for
several
hours
each
day
without
arriving
at
any
satisfactory
result
but
one
morning
he
called
to
mind
his
interview
with
scriven
and
that
marked
kindness
towards
him
he
remembered
the
peculiar
and
unusual
character
of
their
conversation
and
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
scriven
in
asking
how
he
would
like
to
be
a
merchant
had
sought
to
point
out
to
him
the
best
course
he
could
pursue
i
will
be
a
merchant
he
said
to
himself
i
may
help
even
as
a
clerk
and
at
all
events
relieve
my
father
of
the
burden
of
supporting
me
the
next
step
was
to
inquire
how
he
was
to
proceed
he
had
a
natural
repugnance
to
going
to
scriven
again
yet
as
hayley
had
not
mentioned
to
him
his
changed
circumstances
he
was
anxious
to
keep
his
proceedings
a
secret
at
home
till
his
arrangements
were
formed
had
not
lord
mellent
been
at
a
distance
henry
would
have
gone
to
him
direct
for
counsel
in
his
strait
for
the
frank
kindness
which
that
nobleman
had
ever
shown
him
had
won
the
boy
confidence
entirely
but
cut
off
from
that
source
of
advice
he
was
obliged
to
act
without
consolation
and
after
long
deliberation
he
one
morning
put
on
his
hat
and
issued
forth
to
call
upon
scriven
when
he
was
within
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
of
the
he
saw
his
father
approaching
with
a
quick
and
hurried
step
his
brow
clouded
and
his
eyes
bent
anxiously
upon
the
ground
he
was
apparently
coming
from
his
late
house
of
business
and
was
at
some
distance
when
one
of
two
merchants
who
were
walking
in
the
same
direction
as
henry
and
close
before
him
observed
to
the
other
ah
here
comes
poor
hayley
i
am
afraid
the
game
up
with
him
i
can
not
be
sorry
for
him
replied
the
other
in
a
dry
harsh
tone
he
has
acted
like
a
fool
the
next
moment
hayley
approached
still
with
the
same
thoughtful
air
and
probably
in
his
reverie
he
would
have
passed
even
his
son
had
not
the
two
men
who
had
been
speaking
of
him
stopped
him
with
the
ordinary
inquiries
of
the
morning
he
answered
shortly
but
on
raising
his
eyes
saw
henry
before
him
and
inquired
somewhat
eagerly
whither
he
was
going
i
am
going
to
call
on
scriven
replied
the
lad
i
have
not
seen
him
for
several
days
and
he
was
very
kind
to
me
when
last
i
was
there
stop
stop
said
hayley
and
then
after
pausing
for
a
few
moments
and
fixing
his
eye
gloomily
upon
the
pavement
he
added
well
go
and
hurried
on
the
lad
pursued
his
way
to
the
and
inquired
for
scriven
he
was
asked
to
wait
a
few
minutes
and
then
ushered
into
a
large
handsome
room
where
the
head
of
the
house
usually
sat
ah
henry
he
said
in
a
tone
frank
enough
did
you
not
meet
your
father
yes
sir
replied
the
youth
i
met
him
close
to
the
door
did
he
say
anything
particular
to
you
demanded
scriven
no
he
only
asked
where
i
was
going
replied
henry
and
when
i
told
him
he
said
well
go
on
humph
said
scriven
have
you
any
business
to
speak
about
my
young
friend
or
is
this
merely
a
call
i
can
hardly
call
it
business
sir
replied
henry
coming
to
the
point
at
once
but
you
were
kind
enough
when
last
i
saw
you
to
talk
about
my
becoming
a
merchant
i
have
been
thinking
over
the
matter
since
and
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
be
one
if
i
can
have
you
spoken
to
your
father
on
the
subject
asked
scriven
no
sir
answered
the
lad
in
his
usual
candid
manner
i
see
he
is
very
uneasy
about
something
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
been
a
great
burden
to
him
and
i
want
if
possible
to
put
myself
in
the
way
of
relieving
him
rather
than
pressing
upon
him
scriven
gazed
upon
him
with
a
look
of
some
surprise
and
then
said
and
have
you
not
spoken
with
him
upon
the
subject
at
all
not
in
the
least
answered
henry
i
hope
you
do
not
think
it
wrong
for
i
wish
only
to
do
what
is
right
but
as
my
father
has
not
said
a
word
to
me
about
his
affairs
and
perhaps
i
may
be
found
not
to
have
abilities
for
what
i
desire
to
undertake
i
thought
it
would
be
better
not
to
say
anything
till
i
had
tried
and
then
if
i
fail
he
would
not
be
disappointed
you
are
a
singular
boy
upon
my
word
said
scriven
do
you
propose
then
to
go
as
a
clerk
upon
trial
i
do
not
know
what
steps
i
ought
to
take
replied
henry
and
that
is
the
very
subject
upon
which
i
came
to
ask
your
advice
scriven
mused
for
a
moment
and
then
called
for
his
head
clerk
is
young
hamilton
likely
to
return
to
business
soon
he
inquired
as
soon
as
the
clerk
appeared
i
am
afraid
not
sir
replied
the
other
they
tell
me
he
is
in
a
deep
decline
very
well
said
scriven
and
the
clerk
retired
an
important
conversation
followed
though
it
was
not
a
very
long
one
for
all
scriven
ideas
and
expressions
were
so
clear
and
precise
that
he
got
through
much
matter
very
rapidly
his
was
now
without
one
of
the
usual
clerks
and
he
proposed
to
henry
hayley
as
a
favour
to
the
young
man
though
in
fact
it
was
some
assistance
to
himself
to
come
to
his
house
for
three
or
four
hours
each
day
and
do
part
at
least
of
the
work
of
the
sick
lad
who
could
not
attend
he
left
him
to
tell
his
father
or
not
as
he
pleased
but
he
made
such
arrangements
as
to
hours
that
the
communication
need
not
be
forced
upon
him
henry
accepted
the
offer
joyfully
and
returned
home
with
a
lightened
heart
but
in
the
mean
time
scriven
looked
out
for
another
clerk
in
the
place
of
the
one
who
was
ill
for
though
he
had
no
objection
to
give
the
son
of
his
late
partner
the
opportunity
of
learning
a
little
of
mercantile
affairs
and
keeping
some
of
his
books
for
him
at
the
same
time
he
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
taking
henry
hayley
into
his
that
would
never
do
he
said
the
connection
between
his
father
and
myself
must
be
altogether
broken
off
it
is
lucky
i
discovered
his
habits
so
soon
before
he
had
shaken
my
credit
while
he
was
ruining
his
own
chapter
iv
daily
to
the
tick
of
the
clock
at
the
appointed
hour
henry
hayley
was
at
scriven
and
earnestly
and
steadily
did
he
apply
he
became
a
great
favourite
with
the
head
clerk
and
the
cashier
whom
he
assisted
alternately
and
a
quick
and
intelligent
mind
and
retentive
memory
enabled
him
in
ten
days
to
master
more
than
many
other
lads
of
his
age
would
have
acquired
in
as
many
months
scriven
himself
he
seldom
saw
but
that
gentleman
found
that
he
was
very
useful
and
likely
to
become
more
so
and
he
was
inclined
to
regret
that
insuperable
objections
would
prevent
him
from
retaining
him
as
a
clerk
he
suffered
no
hint
of
his
intentions
to
escape
to
the
youth
himself
however
till
he
had
found
the
sort
of
person
he
wanted
for
his
office
and
henry
was
indulging
sanguine
hopes
and
preparing
to
tell
his
father
all
that
had
occurred
when
scriven
dashed
his
expectations
to
the
ground
at
once
by
informing
him
with
all
decent
civility
that
in
a
week
a
new
clerk
would
come
to
fill
the
place
he
had
lately
been
occupying
you
have
now
seen
enough
of
mercantile
life
my
young
friend
he
added
to
judge
whether
it
is
likely
to
suit
your
tastes
or
not
i
think
you
seem
well
fitted
for
it
and
if
you
decide
upon
such
pursuits
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
assist
you
with
this
promise
henry
hayley
was
obliged
to
content
himself
but
he
returned
home
sad
and
he
soon
had
occasion
for
deeper
anxiety
hayley
was
out
all
the
evening
and
a
great
part
of
the
night
his
sister
was
evidently
in
an
agony
of
expectation
and
from
some
casual
words
she
dropped
as
well
as
from
almost
instinctive
suspicions
in
his
own
heart
the
lad
could
not
help
fearing
that
his
father
had
betaken
himself
to
the
again
he
sat
up
with
miss
hayley
till
her
brother
came
home
but
though
hayley
face
was
pale
and
his
eye
haggard
with
strong
excitement
it
was
evident
that
he
was
elated
not
depressed
the
truth
is
he
had
won
a
considerable
sum
of
money
and
to
use
the
idiot
expression
of
persons
of
his
habits
it
seemed
that
the
luck
had
turned
in
his
favour
the
next
morning
just
as
he
was
going
out
an
execution
was
put
into
the
house
it
is
true
the
money
was
paid
immediately
but
it
showed
henry
clearly
for
the
first
time
how
low
his
father
means
had
been
reduced
he
now
resolved
at
once
to
tell
hayley
what
he
had
done
to
explain
to
him
his
feelings
and
his
wishes
without
reserve
and
to
beseech
him
in
existing
circumstances
not
to
send
him
back
to
eton
but
to
obtain
for
him
the
office
of
clerk
in
some
mercantile
house
with
a
good
deal
of
timidity
but
with
that
grace
which
springs
from
the
warmth
of
natural
affection
he
executed
the
task
without
giving
himself
time
to
shrink
from
it
hayley
listened
with
utter
astonishment
and
for
some
moments
seemed
not
to
know
what
to
reply
his
first
answer
consisted
of
nothing
but
broken
incoherent
fragments
of
sentences
and
exclamations
you
henry
you
he
cried
you
acting
as
clerk
to
that
fellow
scriven
the
rascal
he
has
cheated
me
of
thousands
and
does
not
pay
even
what
he
acknowledges
he
owes
me
forsooth
there
may
be
other
claims
to
debase
you
to
be
his
servant
after
a
moment
or
two
he
became
more
collected
however
though
he
remained
greatly
agitated
through
their
whole
conversation
no
henry
he
continued
turning
to
the
subject
of
his
son
future
prospects
no
a
mercantile
life
is
not
fitted
for
you
nor
you
for
it
i
can
not
consent
neither
do
i
think
it
will
be
needful
this
pressure
is
but
temporary
and
i
trust
something
will
to
set
things
to
rights
he
then
paused
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
for
several
minutes
in
deep
thought
and
then
turning
again
to
henry
he
took
his
hand
saying
with
sorrowful
gravity
i
must
not
conceal
from
you
my
dear
boy
that
affairs
are
very
bad
with
me
at
present
unjust
tyrannical
and
pitiful
conduct
has
done
all
that
he
could
do
to
ruin
me
but
he
shall
not
succeed
by
he
shall
not
succeed
this
does
not
affect
you
however
there
is
there
is
a
little
something
settled
upon
you
and
no
scriven
on
earth
can
hurt
you
there
is
quite
enough
to
pay
for
your
education
at
eton
so
do
not
let
that
trouble
you
but
i
think
you
could
do
me
a
service
henry
though
you
are
very
young
my
dear
boy
to
trust
with
such
things
yet
it
is
the
only
way
still
i
do
not
like
to
ask
you
oh
name
it
my
dear
father
name
it
exclaimed
henry
do
you
not
know
that
if
it
were
my
life
i
would
willingly
lay
it
down
for
you
oh
your
life
replied
hayley
smiling
no
it
is
nothing
so
important
as
that
it
is
only
to
execute
a
task
which
i
have
a
foolish
reluctance
to
undertake
myself
the
fact
is
this
pressure
is
but
temporary
and
ten
days
will
see
it
all
at
an
end
yet
in
the
course
of
those
ten
days
i
have
several
thousand
pounds
to
pay
and
look
here
henry
this
is
all
i
have
in
the
world
to
pay
it
with
and
opening
a
drawer
he
showed
him
about
two
hundred
pounds
in
gold
adding
there
is
not
a
sixpence
at
the
bankers
but
what
can
i
do
demanded
henry
hayley
with
youthful
terror
at
the
dark
prospect
so
suddenly
placed
before
him
i
have
got
ten
pounds
but
that
is
nothing
nothing
indeed
answered
hayley
with
a
faint
smile
and
there
is
only
one
person
to
whom
i
can
apply
for
assistance
yet
i
have
shrunk
from
telling
him
the
whole
though
i
have
written
giving
him
some
notion
of
my
state
i
mean
my
friend
lord
mellent
but
he
is
absent
exclaimed
henry
i
went
down
to
harley
lodge
and
found
he
was
in
the
north
that
is
true
said
hayley
and
doubtless
his
close
attendance
on
his
father
a
violent
harsh
and
capricious
man
at
all
times
and
now
rendered
probably
more
exacting
by
sickness
has
prevented
him
from
answering
my
letter
now
henry
what
i
wish
you
to
do
for
me
is
this
go
down
to
lord
mellent
in
the
north
see
him
and
tell
him
exactly
the
state
of
my
affairs
i
have
not
nerve
for
it
myself
for
i
will
be
candid
with
you
henry
driven
almost
to
madness
i
have
done
many
things
which
i
regret
and
which
i
will
never
do
again
mellent
would
ask
me
many
questions
he
will
ask
you
none
he
is
my
oldest
friend
in
the
world
and
has
always
as
you
know
shown
a
very
great
fondness
for
yourself
he
will
not
i
am
sure
refuse
you
if
you
ask
him
to
lend
me
two
thousand
pounds
for
but
one
month
but
press
him
warmly
tell
him
it
must
be
done
directly
if
he
would
save
me
from
ruin
if
he
hesitates
make
it
your
own
request
and
get
him
to
give
you
a
draft
for
it
then
hurry
up
as
speedily
as
possible
for
remember
if
i
have
it
not
in
seven
days
i
am
lost
but
if
he
has
not
got
as
much
ready
money
as
two
thousand
pounds
said
henry
he
has
he
has
exclaimed
hayley
vehemently
he
had
nine
thousand
pounds
at
his
bankers
when
he
went
away
then
i
am
sure
he
will
lend
it
replied
henry
in
a
confident
tone
i
am
quite
certain
i
think
so
too
said
hayley
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
succeed
oh
yes
to
a
certainty
answered
the
inexperienced
boy
i
will
just
write
a
note
to
scriven
saying
that
i
can
not
attend
any
longer
and
then
i
am
ready
to
set
out
you
must
travel
by
the
mail
my
dear
boy
replied
hayley
so
you
will
have
time
enough
we
can
not
afford
now
henry
as
to
writing
to
scriven
let
me
see
yes
you
had
better
write
and
i
would
moreover
advise
you
to
go
there
no
more
he
has
used
me
shamefully
and
he
knows
it
i
must
see
him
from
time
to
time
on
business
but
all
friendship
is
at
an
end
between
us
for
ever
i
shall
certainly
not
go
to
one
who
has
treated
my
father
in
such
a
manner
replied
the
lad
and
i
will
write
to
him
directly
telling
him
merely
that
i
do
not
intend
to
visit
his
any
more
thus
saying
he
left
the
room
and
hayley
continued
for
several
minutes
buried
in
deep
thought
at
length
he
said
in
a
low
tone
he
will
lend
it
certainly
oh
yes
he
will
not
refuse
the
boy
if
he
does
send
the
money
and
i
think
he
will
he
must
then
i
could
take
up
the
bill
before
it
becomes
due
he
then
opened
the
drawer
again
took
out
a
small
tin
case
and
from
that
drew
forth
a
long
slip
of
paper
with
a
stamp
at
one
end
and
a
few
brief
lines
written
on
the
face
he
gazed
at
it
for
a
moment
and
then
thrust
it
back
again
saying
i
wo
till
the
last
extremity
yet
i
have
a
right
he
owes
me
the
money
and
should
have
paid
it
without
this
quibbling
evasion
i
am
a
partner
of
the
house
too
till
it
is
paid
i
have
a
right
to
consider
myself
so
but
still
he
closed
the
drawer
and
locked
it
putting
the
key
in
his
pocket
about
an
hour
after
a
gentleman
was
admitted
to
hayley
a
person
who
remained
with
him
for
about
and
their
conversation
was
somewhat
loud
and
stormy
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
the
servants
in
the
hall
when
the
visiter
came
forth
his
face
was
flushed
and
holding
the
door
in
his
hand
he
said
aloud
not
another
hour
sir
not
another
hour
twelve
and
if
not
why
my
dear
sir
said
the
voice
of
hayley
imploringly
my
dear
sir
stuff
and
nonsense
cried
the
other
i
am
not
your
dear
sir
and
he
walked
out
of
the
house
hayley
passed
two
or
three
hours
alone
his
sister
rebecca
was
very
anxious
and
made
an
excuse
to
go
to
his
but
she
found
the
door
locked
and
her
brother
from
within
begged
not
to
be
disturbed
as
he
was
busy
with
accounts
henry
walked
away
to
the
and
took
a
place
for
the
north
but
he
had
no
spirits
to
call
on
any
one
and
returning
slowly
he
did
not
reach
home
till
about
three
your
papa
has
been
asking
for
you
sir
said
the
servant
who
admitted
him
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
hayley
opened
his
door
saying
henry
henry
here
i
want
you
henry
entered
the
room
and
hayley
put
in
his
hands
the
slip
of
paper
with
the
stamp
upon
it
which
he
had
been
gazing
at
some
hours
before
but
there
was
now
something
written
across
it
i
wish
you
would
take
that
my
dear
boy
to
my
bankers
and
ask
to
see
stolterforth
the
head
partner
you
know
stolterforth
i
think
oh
very
well
replied
the
lad
well
then
give
him
that
and
say
i
should
feel
very
much
obliged
to
him
if
he
will
let
me
have
a
thousand
pounds
upon
it
he
will
do
it
directly
i
am
sure
and
perhaps
may
offer
to
discount
it
for
it
is
for
eighteen
hundred
and
has
only
seven
days
to
run
but
you
may
tell
him
i
do
not
want
to
put
it
into
circulation
because
you
see
it
was
given
by
scriven
in
settlement
of
an
account
which
is
not
yet
finally
made
up
and
there
may
be
some
difference
i
do
not
know
what
a
few
hundred
pounds
you
understand
hayley
hand
shook
a
good
deal
as
he
gave
the
lad
the
paper
and
he
seemed
to
think
it
needed
some
explanation
for
when
henry
replied
that
he
understood
perfectly
his
father
added
it
annoys
me
very
much
to
do
this
at
all
for
if
scriven
were
to
know
it
my
credit
would
be
seriously
injured
by
it
you
may
tell
stolterforth
that
and
mind
you
let
him
know
i
do
not
want
it
to
get
into
circulation
henry
promised
to
do
so
and
putting
on
his
hat
again
he
walked
quietly
away
to
the
bankers
being
well
known
there
he
was
admitted
at
once
to
the
head
partner
showed
him
the
accepted
bill
and
delivered
his
message
calmly
and
accurately
the
banker
at
once
agreed
to
do
what
was
required
asked
him
several
questions
indeed
which
he
could
not
answer
but
showed
no
hesitation
and
after
one
or
two
formalities
gave
him
the
money
which
he
chose
to
have
principally
in
gold
thinking
it
might
be
more
convenient
for
his
father
payments
henry
then
got
into
a
and
drove
away
hayley
was
dreadfully
pale
when
his
son
returned
to
him
but
he
seemed
rejoiced
to
see
the
money
and
immediately
proceeded
to
speak
of
journey
he
gave
him
twenty
pounds
in
gold
and
then
added
fifty
pounds
in
notes
which
henry
would
fain
have
declined
saying
he
could
have
no
use
for
them
but
hayley
urged
that
accidents
might
occur
and
impressed
upon
him
strongly
that
he
must
be
up
before
that
day
week
adding
should
it
be
necessary
take
a
chaise
for
time
may
be
more
valuable
than
money
the
lad
portmanteau
was
soon
packed
up
some
dinner
was
provided
for
him
and
at
the
proper
hour
he
set
out
for
the
took
his
seat
and
was
carried
away
from
london
were
then
the
quickest
conveyances
the
northern
mail
was
supposed
to
travel
at
the
rate
of
eight
miles
an
hour
including
stoppages
and
on
the
young
man
was
hurried
from
the
capital
towards
northumberland
squeezed
up
in
a
hot
summer
night
with
an
enormously
fat
woman
and
a
tolerably
stout
man
the
distance
he
had
to
go
was
about
three
hundred
and
twenty
miles
and
the
town
where
he
was
to
get
out
was
belford
between
which
place
and
wooler
the
mansion
of
the
earl
of
milford
was
situated
farther
he
knew
nothing
of
his
road
except
that
at
belford
he
should
be
able
to
obtain
information
night
set
in
soon
after
he
left
london
and
both
his
companions
were
speedily
asleep
for
they
were
of
the
taciturn
breed
on
which
even
the
aspect
of
youth
has
no
more
effect
than
beauty
upon
a
stone
they
snored
hard
and
sonorously
especially
the
man
woke
up
for
a
moment
into
consciousness
while
the
horses
were
being
changed
and
then
were
as
sound
asleep
as
ever
wherever
provisions
were
to
be
had
indeed
the
lady
roused
herself
and
proceeded
to
the
business
of
the
hour
with
marvellous
activity
considering
her
age
and
weight
but
at
most
other
times
she
was
as
silent
as
her
companion
who
seemed
to
consider
that
locomotion
was
the
proper
and
natural
stimulus
to
slumber
the
forty
weary
hours
passed
at
length
very
few
words
having
been
spoken
but
the
mail
was
not
yet
at
belford
indeed
it
never
was
and
two
more
hours
went
by
before
the
small
town
appeared
it
was
at
that
time
very
dull
and
dirty
and
as
he
looked
up
at
the
sign
of
the
old
bell
henry
felt
the
place
had
a
sort
of
desolate
aspect
which
made
the
prospect
of
sleeping
at
milford
castle
very
pleasant
in
comparison
the
landlord
of
the
bell
however
had
no
intention
of
suffering
him
to
depart
so
easily
milford
castle
he
assured
him
was
full
sixteen
miles
to
the
westward
and
when
henry
replied
that
the
distance
did
not
matter
as
he
must
go
on
that
night
having
business
to
transact
the
worthy
host
discovered
that
all
his
horses
were
out
and
would
not
return
till
two
or
three
in
the
morning
as
there
was
no
other
house
in
the
town
which
kept
henry
was
obliged
to
be
content
and
ordering
a
light
dinner
he
determined
to
sit
and
doze
by
the
fire
till
the
horses
returned
the
landlord
so
contrived
however
what
between
the
necessity
of
giving
food
and
rest
to
cattle
which
were
all
the
time
in
the
stable
and
the
late
hour
at
which
they
were
reported
to
return
from
a
journey
they
had
never
made
that
the
young
traveller
was
obliged
to
remain
all
night
and
breakfast
the
next
morning
at
the
bell
still
little
more
than
hours
had
passed
since
he
had
left
london
when
once
more
he
was
on
the
way
again
he
had
been
allowed
six
whole
days
to
complete
his
task
and
the
coming
time
to
the
mind
of
youth
is
always
long
in
proportion
to
the
shortness
of
the
past
it
was
a
bright
morning
when
he
set
out
again
for
milford
and
all
looked
gay
and
hopeful
but
fatigue
and
impatience
had
done
much
to
diminish
confidence
and
the
way
seemed
interminably
long
the
postboy
preternaturally
slow
there
it
was
found
necessary
to
stop
and
feed
the
horses
and
although
henry
endeavoured
with
a
look
of
importance
to
enforce
the
necessity
of
great
speed
he
was
too
young
for
his
commands
to
be
received
with
any
great
deference
at
about
nine
however
a
little
village
between
bare
high
banks
presented
itself
a
mere
hamlet
with
a
chandler
shop
and
a
and
shortly
after
were
seen
large
gates
and
a
lodge
the
gates
were
opened
by
an
old
woman
who
seemed
like
the
few
stunted
trees
around
to
have
been
bent
by
the
prevailing
wind
but
a
drive
of
two
miles
through
the
large
wild
park
was
still
before
the
young
traveller
the
scenery
certainly
improved
and
gave
him
some
objects
of
interest
to
look
at
the
trees
became
large
and
fine
hill
and
dale
succeeded
to
rises
and
occasional
glimpses
of
an
old
grey
caught
his
eyes
as
he
strained
his
sight
out
of
the
front
windows
of
the
chaise
the
house
disappeared
again
in
thick
plantations
as
he
got
nearer
and
it
was
with
surprise
that
he
found
himself
suddenly
driving
up
to
the
doors
he
was
too
much
accustomed
to
good
society
to
feel
anything
like
shyness
but
yet
he
was
somewhat
anxious
and
advancing
his
head
as
near
the
window
as
possible
without
putting
it
out
he
looked
up
over
the
house
with
some
curiosity
as
the
postboy
rang
the
great
bell
to
his
consternation
he
perceived
that
all
the
windows
were
closed
and
bidding
the
driver
open
the
door
he
jumped
out
no
one
answered
the
summons
of
the
bell
and
he
rang
it
again
after
waiting
several
minutes
it
required
a
third
application
to
bring
any
one
out
and
then
it
was
merely
a
slipshod
country
servant
who
came
round
from
the
back
of
the
house
without
condescending
to
open
the
great
doors
her
first
salutation
was
what
d
want
man
do
you
know
that
the
old
lord
is
dead
and
they
are
gone
to
take
the
corpse
over
to
wales
to
the
place
where
they
all
booried
henry
professed
his
ignorance
of
all
this
and
anxiously
desired
to
know
where
the
young
lord
was
to
be
found
the
girl
however
could
give
him
no
information
but
referred
him
to
the
steward
who
lived
across
the
park
only
adding
it
a
pity
ye
did
come
this
time
yestermorn
for
then
ye
have
found
the
young
lord
and
the
old
lord
too
only
he
was
dead
poor
body
to
the
steward
house
henry
then
betook
himself
but
the
steward
himself
was
out
and
his
wife
could
only
tell
the
visiter
that
he
was
likely
to
find
the
present
earl
at
caermarthen
as
he
was
to
meet
the
body
of
his
father
there
the
family
vault
being
in
that
neighbourhood
an
eton
boy
knowledge
of
geography
at
the
age
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
is
not
usually
very
great
for
the
most
important
objects
of
education
are
generally
those
the
most
neglected
in
this
happy
country
but
still
henry
was
aware
that
he
would
be
nearer
caermarthen
at
wooler
than
at
belford
the
driver
was
indeed
unwilling
to
go
that
road
and
his
reluctance
was
only
overcome
by
a
promise
of
good
payment
the
greater
part
of
the
day
however
was
wasted
by
all
the
delays
he
had
encountered
and
although
he
was
resolved
to
go
on
under
any
circumstances
and
find
his
father
friend
yet
the
journey
was
a
long
one
and
he
felt
puzzled
and
apprehensive
luckily
at
wooler
he
found
an
intelligent
landlord
who
gave
him
some
serviceable
information
regarding
the
line
of
his
journey
and
after
writing
a
brief
note
to
hayley
informing
him
of
what
had
occurred
he
resumed
his
expedition
resolved
to
travel
night
and
day
this
was
not
so
easily
achieved
as
determined
but
i
need
not
follow
him
through
all
the
difficulties
that
beset
him
suffice
it
that
at
preston
his
gold
fell
short
and
he
was
obliged
to
change
one
of
the
notes
which
had
been
given
him
by
hayley
this
occurred
again
before
he
reached
caermarthen
for
though
he
was
anxious
to
pursue
his
course
as
economically
as
possible
were
scanty
their
hours
were
often
inconvenient
and
he
recollected
with
a
feeling
of
apprehension
the
last
expression
of
his
father
time
is
more
valuable
than
money
eagerly
i
might
say
vehemently
he
hurried
on
but
still
the
long
long
journey
from
one
side
of
the
island
to
the
other
occupied
far
more
time
than
he
had
expected
sometimes
horses
could
not
be
had
at
others
a
whole
hour
was
wasted
rousing
ostlers
and
postboys
then
came
slow
drivers
and
hilly
countries
bad
roads
and
worse
horses
the
fifth
day
from
that
of
his
departure
was
drawing
towards
its
close
when
he
at
length
reached
caermarthen
weary
exhausted
and
feeling
ill
still
before
he
took
any
refreshment
at
the
inn
he
inquired
for
the
family
seat
of
the
earl
of
milford
the
waiter
could
tell
him
nothing
about
it
the
landlord
was
sent
for
and
proved
more
communicative
it
lay
at
twelve
or
thirteen
miles
distance
he
said
but
if
you
have
come
for
the
funeral
sir
he
added
looking
at
the
lad
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
you
are
too
late
it
took
place
early
this
morning
and
the
new
lord
that
is
lord
mellent
as
was
passed
through
about
four
hours
ago
on
his
way
back
to
london
i
must
follow
him
directly
said
henry
almost
wildly
i
have
business
of
the
greatest
importance
with
him
then
you
had
better
take
a
place
in
the
mail
sir
said
the
landlord
it
starts
from
this
house
and
you
will
save
more
time
by
it
than
by
posting
it
starts
at
two
and
it
now
nine
but
between
this
and
town
you
lose
more
than
five
hours
by
getting
out
horses
and
slow
going
henry
experience
showed
him
that
what
the
good
man
said
was
true
the
mail
must
bring
him
into
london
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
fatal
seventh
day
by
posting
he
might
delay
his
arrival
and
he
thought
if
he
reached
his
father
house
by
five
in
the
morning
there
would
still
be
time
enough
before
business
hours
began
for
hayley
to
see
the
earl
and
obtain
his
assistance
his
course
therefore
was
soon
determined
his
place
in
the
mail
secured
and
during
the
time
he
had
to
stay
he
endeavoured
to
refresh
and
strengthen
himself
for
his
onward
journey
even
in
the
gay
and
bounding
days
of
youth
the
mind
is
in
sad
slavery
to
the
body
fatigue
and
exhaustion
will
make
the
aspect
of
all
things
gloomy
and
rest
and
food
will
restore
their
brightness
the
landlady
at
caermarthen
was
a
good
kind
motherly
woman
and
taking
the
weary
young
traveller
into
her
parlour
she
soon
provided
him
with
a
light
supper
and
a
few
glasses
of
wine
added
revived
the
lad
spirits
greatly
he
eased
the
aching
of
his
limbs
by
walking
up
and
down
the
room
and
when
the
mail
was
ready
to
start
felt
quite
equal
to
the
fatigue
there
was
no
other
passenger
in
the
inside
and
he
amused
himself
as
best
he
could
sometimes
by
sleeping
sometimes
after
daybreak
by
gazing
out
at
the
prospect
at
length
night
began
to
fall
again
and
henry
fell
asleep
once
more
he
was
awakened
by
the
coach
stopping
to
change
horses
all
was
ready
and
in
haste
the
beasts
were
put
to
but
while
he
was
looking
out
of
the
window
there
was
a
good
deal
of
bustle
at
the
inn
door
and
he
saw
something
carried
in
by
three
or
four
men
he
had
no
time
however
to
make
inquiries
for
the
coachman
was
mounting
his
box
and
the
next
moment
the
mail
dashed
off
two
stages
farther
on
it
was
announced
to
him
that
a
quarter
of
an
hour
was
allowed
for
supper
and
as
he
got
out
he
inquired
of
the
guard
what
was
the
matter
a
couple
of
stages
behind
why
the
gentleman
carriage
had
been
overturned
at
the
bridge
sir
replied
the
guard
and
he
had
been
stunned
with
what
they
call
a
concussion
of
the
brain
white
said
so
they
were
carrying
him
in
that
was
what
you
saw
i
dare
say
do
you
know
who
he
was
demanded
henry
with
feelings
of
unaccountable
alarm
oh
yes
sir
replied
the
man
i
saw
him
at
caermarthen
yesterday
it
the
young
lord
whose
father
just
dead
and
buried
he
like
enough
to
be
soon
dead
and
buried
too
for
he
badly
hurt
and
his
carriage
all
dashed
to
smash
a
moment
of
bewildering
uncertainty
succeeded
henry
asked
himself
first
should
he
go
back
then
for
what
purpose
but
he
soon
saw
that
to
do
so
would
serve
none
he
could
not
see
and
speak
to
lord
mellent
in
such
a
state
and
he
resolved
to
hurry
on
though
to
be
the
bearer
of
such
disastrous
tidings
to
his
father
made
his
heart
sink
he
ate
no
supper
he
slept
no
more
and
driver
and
horses
being
good
he
arrived
at
the
general
a
little
after
four
a
was
soon
obtained
the
guard
and
coachman
were
feed
and
before
five
he
was
at
his
father
house
the
instant
the
coach
stopped
the
door
was
opened
by
hayley
himself
and
henry
sprang
out
to
meet
him
put
the
portmanteau
in
the
hall
and
wait
said
hayley
to
the
coachman
and
holding
henry
hand
he
led
him
towards
his
own
the
lad
saw
that
his
father
was
pale
and
haggard
and
he
dreaded
the
effect
of
what
he
had
to
tell
but
still
he
would
not
delay
and
even
as
they
went
to
the
room
the
main
facts
were
poured
forth
to
his
surprise
hayley
seemed
hardly
to
listen
and
when
they
were
in
the
study
he
locked
the
door
and
gazed
earnestly
at
the
boy
his
words
were
short
sharp
and
to
the
lad
seemed
wild
henry
he
said
you
love
me
i
think
do
you
not
henry
gazed
in
his
face
utterly
astounded
i
know
you
do
his
father
added
i
am
sure
you
do
now
my
dear
boy
you
can
prove
it
you
can
save
my
life
my
honour
how
how
cried
the
boy
i
will
do
all
anything
you
please
my
dear
father
only
tell
me
what
it
is
henry
to
get
into
that
coach
again
and
drive
down
to
blackwall
you
will
there
find
a
steamer
ready
to
start
for
rotterdam
at
six
in
the
morning
embark
in
her
from
rotterdam
go
up
the
rhine
through
germany
to
italy
and
stay
at
ancona
till
you
hear
from
me
here
are
money
and
a
passport
but
why
why
asked
the
boy
earnestly
oh
tell
me
all
for
fear
i
make
any
mistake
hayley
grasped
his
arm
very
tight
and
bending
down
his
head
whispered
in
a
voice
hardly
audible
yet
stern
too
henry
that
bill
which
you
took
to
the
bankers
was
forged
forged
it
if
you
stay
you
must
stay
to
be
a
witness
against
me
and
condemn
me
to
death
the
young
man
sank
down
in
a
chair
with
a
face
so
pale
that
his
father
thought
he
was
going
to
faint
here
take
some
wine
he
said
pouring
him
out
a
from
a
decanter
that
stood
on
the
table
and
henry
drank
it
all
the
father
gazed
upon
his
face
with
a
look
of
agonised
expectation
while
the
lad
put
his
hand
to
his
head
as
if
to
recover
his
scattered
thoughts
but
they
will
say
i
did
it
he
murmured
at
length
i
shall
be
an
exile
for
ever
and
never
see
you
more
they
will
say
you
did
it
replied
hayley
they
think
even
now
you
did
it
i
was
obliged
to
deny
i
sent
you
even
to
gain
time
for
it
was
discovered
last
night
and
an
officer
set
off
into
northumberland
immediately
to
seek
you
do
as
you
will
henry
you
now
know
all
but
it
you
stay
i
will
go
and
give
myself
up
directly
you
shall
see
me
again
if
you
go
for
as
soon
as
the
inquiry
is
over
i
will
come
and
join
you
but
no
time
is
to
be
lost
your
resolution
must
be
taken
in
five
minutes
i
will
go
i
will
go
said
the
lad
faintly
but
oh
my
father
give
me
means
of
proving
my
innocence
hereafter
i
have
it
ready
said
hayley
i
have
thought
of
all
prepared
all
look
here
and
taking
up
a
paper
he
read
stephen
hayley
acknowledge
that
the
acceptance
of
henry
scriven
to
a
bill
i
need
not
read
all
that
forged
by
me
and
that
my
son
took
it
to
stolterforth
by
my
orders
without
knowing
it
to
be
forged
then
further
i
state
as
you
may
see
that
you
go
abroad
to
save
me
now
henry
my
life
is
in
your
hands
act
as
you
like
and
sinking
down
into
a
chair
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
the
next
instant
henry
hand
was
laid
upon
his
arm
i
am
going
he
said
farewell
my
father
farewell
stay
stay
said
hayley
starting
up
remember
the
passport
and
the
money
too
here
are
two
hundred
napoleons
they
go
everywhere
ah
henry
dear
good
lad
your
consolation
must
be
that
you
have
saved
your
father
life
henry
made
no
reply
but
the
tears
fell
over
his
cheeks
hayley
pressed
him
to
his
heart
it
was
a
selfish
one
but
still
gratitude
did
mingle
with
rejoicing
for
his
own
safety
in
five
minutes
more
he
was
in
the
coach
with
another
portmanteau
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
the
night
before
by
his
father
bearing
marked
upon
it
henry
calvert
esq
passenger
by
of
antwerp
on
looking
at
the
passport
he
found
the
same
name
therein
and
saw
for
that
hayley
had
forgotten
to
explain
that
he
was
to
take
that
name
during
his
flight
in
about
of
an
hour
he
stood
upon
the
deck
of
the
vessel
and
in
ten
minutes
after
his
embarkation
she
was
going
quickly
down
the
river
the
same
morning
on
the
arrival
of
the
newcastle
mail
two
officers
in
plain
clothes
had
walked
up
to
the
side
and
examined
every
passenger
both
inside
and
outside
there
were
in
all
three
men
and
two
women
but
neither
of
the
men
bore
the
least
resemblance
to
henry
hayley
and
the
officers
turned
their
attention
to
the
the
caermarthen
mail
escaped
unexplored
an
examination
into
the
affair
took
place
that
day
at
bow
street
but
it
was
proved
that
henry
had
unknown
to
hayley
frequented
the
of
scriven
for
more
than
a
fortnight
that
he
was
anxious
to
conceal
his
doing
so
from
his
father
that
on
the
very
morning
of
his
departure
for
northumberland
he
had
written
to
scriven
to
say
he
should
come
no
more
that
at
four
that
day
he
had
obtained
money
upon
the
forged
bill
and
then
gone
no
one
rightly
knew
whither
further
than
that
his
journey
was
towards
northumberland
for
hayley
took
care
to
give
no
explanations
on
that
head
a
thousand
little
circumstances
of
no
real
value
such
as
some
small
bills
at
eton
left
unpaid
tended
to
make
up
a
mass
of
evidence
against
him
and
thus
the
guilty
escaped
if
not
without
doubts
yet
without
any
charge
against
him
while
the
whole
weight
of
suspicion
fell
upon
the
innocent
boy
who
was
sailing
away
over
the
sea
to
rotterdam
chapter
the
curious
state
of
society
in
which
we
exist
and
the
complex
causes
and
effects
which
it
comprises
the
fictitious
the
factitious
the
unreal
the
unnatural
relations
which
it
establishes
between
man
and
man
are
always
producing
unexpected
results
and
events
which
no
one
can
rightly
account
for
because
no
one
can
trace
all
the
fine
lines
which
connect
one
piece
of
the
complicated
machinery
with
another
it
must
have
often
struck
every
thinker
who
gathers
up
the
passing
events
and
marks
the
impression
which
they
produce
upon
the
world
at
large
that
matters
often
of
great
moment
will
excite
little
or
no
attention
will
be
slurred
over
in
newspapers
pass
without
comment
in
society
be
hardly
heard
of
beyond
the
narrowest
possible
circle
round
the
point
at
which
they
take
place
while
mere
trifles
will
set
rumour
thousand
tongues
men
and
women
will
interest
themselves
with
eager
anxiety
about
things
that
do
not
affect
them
in
the
least
and
half
the
world
will
be
on
fire
as
to
whether
a
feather
was
blown
to
the
right
or
the
left
the
basest
political
scheme
that
ever
was
practised
for
depriving
a
queen
of
hope
happiness
and
power
and
a
great
country
of
its
independence
will
excite
far
less
attention
and
curiosity
than
the
disappointment
of
one
ambition
and
the
compensation
of
another
priest
unmerited
persecution
when
first
my
attention
was
directed
to
this
subject
i
said
a
cannon
fired
in
an
open
country
can
not
by
any
chance
produce
such
terrible
results
as
a
spark
in
a
it
is
not
the
event
itself
that
is
important
but
the
things
with
which
it
is
connected
that
make
it
so
but
i
soon
became
convinced
that
this
explanation
though
specious
was
not
true
at
least
that
there
was
something
more
that
whenever
anything
made
a
great
noise
it
must
connect
itself
by
some
of
the
many
hooks
and
pulleys
of
society
with
some
of
the
loud
tongues
in
high
places
by
high
places
i
do
not
mean
elevated
stations
but
positions
in
which
men
can
make
themselves
heard
some
newspaper
scribe
one
of
the
things
in
parliament
assembled
a
popular
preacher
a
is
either
interested
in
the
matter
directly
or
indirectly
immediately
or
remotely
or
else
has
nothing
else
to
do
and
wants
a
hobby
and
the
whole
affair
is
made
the
talk
of
the
town
in
short
it
were
endless
to
search
out
arrange
and
classify
the
infinite
variety
of
causes
which
may
render
any
event
notorious
or
consign
it
to
speedy
oblivion
though
it
may
rend
the
hearts
ruin
the
fortunes
desolate
the
prospects
and
destroy
the
peace
of
all
within
a
certain
little
circle
the
forgery
upon
scriven
made
little
or
no
noise
in
the
great
world
the
first
investigation
at
bow
street
was
fully
reported
in
one
or
two
of
the
morning
newspapers
some
others
which
had
no
reporters
of
their
own
abridged
it
from
their
esteemed
contemporaries
others
declared
there
were
no
matters
of
public
interest
at
bow
street
that
day
because
they
had
not
room
to
report
more
than
the
donations
of
notes
to
the
the
receipt
of
which
had
been
requested
to
be
acknowledged
but
the
event
was
a
terrible
one
in
the
midst
of
those
more
immediately
interested
scriven
pursued
the
inquiry
into
the
facts
with
a
fierceness
and
a
virulence
which
had
not
before
appeared
in
his
nature
and
undoubtedly
hayley
himself
might
have
fallen
into
danger
had
not
many
little
circumstances
some
accidental
some
skilfully
prepared
combined
to
fix
the
guilt
upon
the
innocent
as
an
instance
of
one
of
those
accidents
which
served
to
shelter
him
i
may
mention
that
upon
the
examination
of
his
servants
one
of
the
footmen
deposed
and
deposed
truly
that
three
or
four
days
before
henry
disappearance
hayley
had
been
eagerly
inquiring
if
any
one
had
found
a
piece
of
stamped
paper
a
draft
in
short
and
seemed
very
uneasy
about
it
scriven
admitted
that
hayley
had
told
him
he
had
drawn
upon
him
and
that
he
had
refused
to
accept
the
draft
thus
the
body
of
the
document
being
evidently
in
hayley
handwriting
and
the
acceptance
which
constituted
the
forgery
being
in
a
feigned
hand
very
like
that
of
scriven
the
inference
was
established
by
the
servant
evidence
that
henry
had
found
the
draft
and
used
it
for
his
own
purposes
the
fact
was
that
hayley
had
mislaid
the
document
for
some
time
at
the
period
when
he
first
contemplated
the
forgery
and
had
inquired
for
it
anxiously
till
he
found
it
in
the
place
where
he
had
concealed
it
but
many
other
things
occurred
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
to
confirm
the
suspicions
against
the
poor
boy
three
notes
which
henry
had
changed
in
his
long
travelling
across
england
found
their
way
to
the
bank
of
england
where
the
numbers
and
dates
of
those
given
upon
the
forged
draft
had
been
notified
they
were
traced
back
from
hand
to
hand
till
the
chain
ended
with
henry
hayley
the
whole
of
his
wandering
course
with
a
very
few
intervals
was
tracked
by
the
officer
sent
in
pursuit
of
him
to
northumberland
he
was
found
to
have
been
at
belford
at
wooler
at
caermarthen
and
then
to
have
come
to
london
in
the
mail
with
the
instinct
of
bloodhounds
the
officers
pursued
their
inquiries
got
a
clue
at
the
office
of
the
dutch
consul
to
his
further
course
and
furnished
with
the
necessary
authority
set
out
for
rotterdam
now
hayley
began
to
tremble
and
scriven
to
rejoice
we
shall
soon
have
him
now
said
the
latter
to
lady
fleetwood
rubbing
his
hands
we
shall
soon
have
him
now
p
is
not
a
man
to
give
up
the
chase
till
he
has
run
down
his
game
why
i
am
sure
henry
you
do
not
think
him
guilty
said
lady
fleetwood
nobody
that
knew
him
can
think
so
and
even
if
you
did
you
would
never
wish
to
destroy
the
poor
lad
her
brother
gazed
at
her
in
utter
astonishment
do
you
wish
me
to
think
you
a
fool
margaret
he
said
nobody
but
one
totally
destitute
of
common
sense
can
doubt
his
guilt
well
i
do
scriven
replied
lady
fleetwood
a
little
nettled
i
never
pretended
to
any
great
sense
and
i
dare
say
you
have
a
great
deal
more
but
he
was
all
his
life
a
fine
frank
honourable
boy
and
it
is
not
into
such
a
heart
as
his
that
a
crime
enters
easily
however
even
if
he
had
done
it
i
do
not
think
you
would
be
cruel
enough
to
punish
with
death
a
mere
boy
like
that
who
could
not
know
all
the
criminality
of
the
act
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
scriven
it
is
the
law
will
punish
him
and
that
soon
i
hope
else
there
will
not
be
a
clerk
in
all
london
who
will
not
be
forging
his
master
name
and
then
pleading
his
youth
then
i
trust
with
all
my
heart
the
law
wo
catch
him
said
lady
fleetwood
what
are
a
thousand
pounds
to
you
henry
it
would
have
been
much
kinder
of
you
to
have
paid
the
money
and
said
nothing
about
it
scriven
gave
her
a
look
of
unutterable
scorn
and
buttoning
up
his
coat
to
keep
out
such
ridiculous
notions
quitted
the
house
he
was
a
good
deal
surprised
however
to
find
that
even
his
sister
lady
monkton
in
some
degree
shared
the
views
of
lady
fleetwood
she
expressed
herself
somewhat
more
cautiously
perhaps
but
not
less
firmly
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
judging
from
long
observation
of
henry
character
nothing
would
persuade
her
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
the
act
imputed
to
him
then
pray
who
was
it
lady
monkton
asked
scriven
sharply
that
is
quite
another
question
and
one
that
i
will
not
take
upon
me
to
answer
replied
isabella
but
let
us
drop
the
subject
for
it
is
a
very
very
painful
one
we
all
loved
him
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
our
own
relations
and
he
could
not
have
made
himself
so
loved
by
people
who
saw
his
whole
conduct
if
there
had
been
anything
dishonourable
or
disingenuous
in
his
nature
your
love
blinds
you
replied
scriven
and
maria
monkton
who
had
been
drawing
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
rose
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
went
out
those
who
did
love
the
poor
lad
and
they
were
many
had
soon
fresh
cause
for
grief
six
weeks
passed
without
anything
being
heard
of
the
officer
who
had
gone
to
seek
for
the
young
fugitive
not
a
doubt
existed
in
his
mind
that
the
henry
calvert
of
the
dutch
was
identical
with
the
henry
hayley
of
bow
street
and
having
got
a
full
account
of
his
person
and
general
appearance
this
conviction
was
strengthened
at
rotterdam
where
he
traced
him
to
the
inn
he
thence
pursued
him
up
the
rhine
to
cologne
where
for
two
days
he
could
discover
no
further
track
from
his
assumed
name
having
been
terribly
mutilated
in
the
books
stage
by
stage
he
pursued
him
still
sometimes
indeed
almost
giving
up
the
undertaking
in
despair
but
always
by
perseverance
gaining
some
new
clue
thus
to
munich
innspruck
trieste
and
venice
he
was
lured
on
and
there
for
five
days
remained
baffled
till
it
struck
the
consul
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
inquire
of
a
celebrated
at
mestre
when
they
went
over
the
man
was
absent
with
his
horses
and
the
officer
had
to
wait
another
day
for
his
return
the
subsequent
morning
however
he
was
more
fortunate
his
questions
were
answered
at
once
ten
days
before
the
said
he
had
carried
a
young
english
lad
answering
exactly
the
description
given
to
ancona
instead
of
being
he
stated
that
the
young
man
was
very
pale
but
then
he
was
ill
when
he
quitted
mestre
and
got
worse
every
day
till
they
reached
ancona
there
the
people
of
the
inn
would
not
take
him
in
for
by
that
time
the
youth
could
not
hold
up
his
head
at
all
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
him
nor
how
to
make
him
understand
for
he
spoke
little
italian
he
had
applied
at
the
house
of
the
franciscan
friars
where
he
knew
there
were
some
irish
monks
and
they
had
charitably
received
him
there
the
officer
would
find
him
he
said
and
that
personage
without
pause
set
out
at
once
for
ancona
it
was
night
when
he
reached
the
city
but
he
delayed
not
an
instant
and
finding
that
he
could
not
get
aid
from
the
police
of
the
place
before
morning
he
went
at
once
with
a
guide
to
the
monastery
to
give
notice
of
his
errand
and
ensure
that
the
culprit
was
not
suffered
to
escape
he
had
some
hopes
indeed
that
the
monks
would
give
him
up
at
once
but
nothing
was
opened
in
answer
to
the
great
bell
except
the
small
shutter
over
a
grate
in
the
door
the
porter
who
appeared
behind
was
an
italian
but
the
guide
could
speak
a
little
english
and
served
as
interpreter
to
the
first
question
whether
a
young
englishman
of
the
name
of
henry
calvert
was
there
the
monk
replied
he
did
not
know
and
to
the
officer
demand
of
admittance
returned
a
direct
refusal
the
other
explained
his
errand
but
it
was
of
no
avail
it
was
contrary
to
the
rule
the
good
brother
said
and
whatever
was
the
officer
business
he
could
not
have
admission
at
that
hour
the
latter
next
demanded
to
speak
with
some
of
the
english
or
irish
brethren
and
after
some
hesitation
the
old
man
went
away
to
bring
one
to
the
gate
the
officer
had
to
wait
fully
but
at
length
a
lantern
was
seen
coming
across
the
court
and
the
shaven
head
of
an
elderly
man
appeared
behind
the
grating
what
is
it
you
want
my
son
he
asked
in
english
after
gazing
at
the
officer
attentively
as
he
came
up
i
understand
and
that
upon
sufficient
evidence
replied
the
other
that
within
this
monastery
you
have
a
person
named
henry
calvert
otherwise
hayley
charged
with
forgery
to
a
large
amount
i
am
the
bearer
of
a
warrant
for
his
apprehension
which
i
can
show
you
and
i
demand
that
you
deliver
up
his
body
to
my
custody
we
know
nothing
of
english
warrants
here
replied
the
monk
and
the
gates
of
this
convent
are
opened
after
nine
to
no
one
either
to
admit
or
to
send
forth
go
your
way
my
son
and
return
if
needs
must
be
but
come
not
without
the
authority
of
the
state
in
which
you
are
otherwise
you
will
come
in
vain
the
monk
was
retiring
but
the
officer
called
after
him
in
somewhat
civiller
tones
than
perhaps
his
heart
dictated
saying
tell
me
at
least
sir
if
the
young
man
is
here
perhaps
i
should
be
wise
to
refuse
an
answer
said
the
monk
seeing
that
i
know
you
not
neither
what
right
you
have
to
inquire
but
as
there
are
plenty
ready
to
defend
any
of
our
just
privileges
i
will
venture
to
say
that
a
lad
a
mere
boy
calling
himself
henry
calvert
is
here
but
he
is
i
tell
you
at
the
point
of
death
having
been
brought
in
sick
of
the
malignant
fever
which
is
now
raging
so
fiercely
in
those
parts
of
italy
i
must
see
him
notwithstanding
said
the
officer
doggedly
but
the
monk
waited
no
further
conference
and
retired
from
the
gate
the
londoner
and
his
guide
walked
back
to
the
inn
and
as
they
went
along
through
the
dark
and
gloomy
streets
a
slow
and
solemn
sound
the
tolling
of
a
heavy
bell
burst
upon
the
ear
the
next
morning
at
the
earliest
possible
hour
the
application
was
made
to
the
police
of
ancona
assistance
was
immediately
given
him
and
with
his
guide
and
a
commissary
of
the
government
he
returned
to
the
monastery
the
outer
gates
were
now
wide
open
and
a
number
of
people
monks
and
others
were
passing
in
and
out
at
a
small
door
of
the
principal
building
stood
the
old
man
he
had
seen
on
the
preceding
night
and
to
him
the
commissary
of
police
at
once
led
the
way
some
conversation
took
place
between
them
in
italian
and
then
the
monk
turned
to
the
officer
saying
this
good
man
my
son
tells
me
you
are
duly
authorised
to
take
into
your
custody
the
lad
named
henry
calvert
otherwise
you
say
hayley
we
do
not
resist
the
laws
and
he
shall
be
given
up
to
you
follow
me
the
three
men
followed
across
the
court
to
a
low
wing
of
the
building
the
monk
preceding
them
with
a
slow
and
heavy
step
they
then
walked
along
a
sort
of
cloister
dry
and
shady
and
at
the
fifth
door
on
the
right
the
old
man
stopped
and
turned
a
key
there
he
is
he
said
throwing
open
the
door
and
the
officer
entered
upon
a
low
pallet
stripped
of
its
usual
coverings
lay
a
corpse
with
a
few
flowers
strewed
upon
the
bosom
the
waxy
hue
of
the
face
the
plain
ravages
of
illness
the
closed
eyes
the
emaciated
features
might
make
a
great
difference
but
still
the
colour
of
the
hair
the
age
the
height
and
the
general
lines
of
the
features
showed
the
officer
that
there
indeed
before
him
lay
all
that
remained
of
the
gay
frank
happy
boy
he
gazed
on
him
for
a
moment
or
two
and
even
ne
was
moved
in
some
degree
when
did
he
die
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
last
night
five
minutes
before
ten
answered
the
monk
when
i
returned
to
him
after
seeing
you
he
was
in
the
agony
another
pause
succeeded
and
then
the
monk
pointing
to
an
english
portmanteau
which
stood
in
the
corner
of
the
cell
said
i
am
ordered
to
give
that
and
its
contents
into
your
custody
there
are
besides
this
containing
the
passport
with
which
he
travelled
and
some
he
had
also
a
small
sum
in
gold
and
silver
with
him
for
which
the
convent
will
account
to
the
police
and
the
police
to
your
own
consul
after
the
expenses
of
the
funeral
are
paid
can
you
tell
me
whether
he
was
a
catholic
or
not
we
are
troubled
about
the
burial
i
do
know
i
am
sure
replied
the
officer
but
he
then
added
with
a
desire
to
avoid
any
unpleasant
proceeding
i
dare
say
he
was
a
catholic
i
think
i
have
heard
so
then
he
shall
have
catholic
interment
replied
the
monk
and
after
a
few
more
questions
the
officer
withdrew
the
portmanteau
was
put
into
a
hired
carriage
and
conveyed
to
the
inn
the
notes
were
compared
with
a
list
which
the
officer
carried
and
found
to
correspond
with
seven
of
the
numbers
there
inscribed
and
after
a
conference
with
the
british
consul
the
bow
street
runner
took
his
departure
from
ancona
saying
the
old
monk
declared
there
was
only
a
small
sum
in
gold
i
know
there
must
have
been
a
good
lot
if
the
lad
did
not
lead
a
terribly
riotous
life
as
he
came
and
of
that
i
heard
nothing
there
were
many
who
wept
for
poor
henry
hayley
but
there
was
one
who
felt
that
he
had
more
cause
to
weep
than
all
though
he
could
not
shed
a
tear
hayley
fell
into
profound
melancholy
from
which
nothing
could
rouse
him
his
affairs
righted
themselves
in
a
very
great
degree
without
his
making
an
effort
several
of
the
speculations
in
which
he
had
engaged
proved
eminently
successful
but
they
brought
no
comfort
he
walked
about
his
house
and
the
town
like
a
ghost
never
speaking
to
any
one
but
those
who
spoke
to
him
and
it
was
observed
that
he
often
talked
to
himself
but
no
one
heard
anything
escape
his
lips
save
the
one
solitary
word
murder
murmured
in
the
accents
of
horror
and
despair
chapter
iv
this
shall
be
an
exceedingly
short
chapter
merely
destined
to
wind
up
that
preliminary
matter
with
which
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
reader
to
be
made
acquainted
before
perusing
the
real
business
of
the
tale
another
long
lapse
of
nearly
ten
years
must
intervene
before
we
take
up
any
of
the
characters
afresh
and
the
reader
will
soon
see
now
the
preceding
events
connect
themselves
with
those
that
follow
the
characters
indeed
were
sadly
diminished
in
number
between
the
time
at
which
the
story
opens
and
that
to
which
i
have
now
to
proceed
of
the
four
children
of
the
elder
scriven
only
two
survived
lady
fleetwood
and
scriven
lady
monkton
survived
her
husband
just
ten
years
and
then
died
very
suddenly
leaving
her
daughter
maria
the
heiress
of
great
wealth
at
the
age
of
about
twenty
she
was
indeed
a
few
months
more
when
her
mother
was
taken
from
her
and
guardianship
had
not
long
to
run
a
fact
with
which
that
gentleman
was
not
well
pleased
for
besides
the
authority
which
the
guardianship
conferred
and
all
men
like
authority
the
whole
of
the
fortune
which
his
sister
isabella
had
received
and
the
accumulated
surplus
of
the
rents
of
sir
edward
monkton
estates
making
together
a
very
large
sum
remained
in
his
hands
and
he
found
them
exceedingly
convenient
nay
more
somewhat
lucrative
he
clearly
accounted
for
the
interest
upon
every
penny
at
a
moderate
rate
but
he
did
not
think
it
at
all
necessary
to
state
to
maria
or
to
calculate
in
any
way
except
for
his
own
private
satisfaction
and
i
do
not
know
that
he
even
did
that
all
that
he
gained
by
turning
and
returning
the
funds
of
hers
at
his
disposal
that
went
under
the
general
head
of
profits
of
business
i
am
not
aware
whether
this
would
be
considered
right
fair
and
honourable
in
the
mercantile
world
or
not
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
both
sides
of
the
question
but
certainly
while
he
allowed
as
i
have
stated
interest
upon
every
penny
that
he
received
at
the
exact
rate
which
that
penny
would
have
produced
if
invested
in
the
public
funds
on
the
day
that
he
received
it
he
made
sometimes
twice
sometimes
three
times
that
amount
by
the
use
of
the
money
maria
however
knew
nothing
about
this
when
she
did
come
of
age
she
passed
the
accounts
as
a
matter
of
course
and
begged
her
uncle
to
continue
to
manage
her
affairs
for
her
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
but
when
this
source
of
anxiety
had
gone
by
scriven
had
another
maria
inherited
all
her
mother
beauty
she
was
a
gay
gentle
girl
with
a
natural
cheerfulness
of
character
generally
predominating
over
and
subduing
occasional
clouds
of
melancholy
which
might
well
be
produced
by
the
early
death
of
parents
deeply
beloved
lovely
wealthy
graceful
engaging
with
a
heart
full
of
warm
affections
and
a
kind
disposition
it
was
more
than
probable
that
she
would
marry
early
indeed
only
wonderful
that
she
had
not
already
married
then
again
she
chose
to
reside
during
a
great
part
of
the
year
with
her
aunt
lady
fleetwood
in
london
her
aunt
house
was
the
only
proper
place
for
her
but
still
it
made
scriven
somewhat
uneasy
for
lady
fleetwood
was
the
kindest
and
best
intentioned
woman
in
the
world
and
though
by
no
means
what
is
called
a
matchmaker
she
had
a
very
strong
conviction
which
her
own
experience
had
not
shaken
in
the
least
that
marriage
was
the
only
state
in
which
a
woman
could
be
really
happy
on
this
point
scriven
differed
with
her
entirely
and
it
was
not
at
all
pleasant
to
him
to
know
that
she
was
continually
dinning
her
own
system
into
maria
ears
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
his
only
consolation
was
that
his
niece
was
fond
of
going
down
alone
from
time
to
time
to
bolton
park
which
was
kept
up
exactly
in
the
same
state
as
at
lady
monkton
death
it
was
generally
too
at
the
time
when
london
was
fullest
and
gayest
that
maria
chose
to
make
her
retreat
and
at
bolton
she
saw
no
one
but
her
neighbour
lady
anne
mellent
the
similarity
of
whose
situation
to
her
own
drew
closer
the
bonds
of
early
affection
though
their
characters
were
very
different
it
may
be
said
in
passing
that
lady
anne
had
been
longer
an
orphan
at
this
time
than
maria
for
lord
milford
had
not
survived
the
death
of
his
father
many
years
and
lady
milford
had
died
the
christmas
before
her
husband
lady
anne
gay
lively
and
decided
in
character
had
been
left
to
the
guardianship
of
mere
men
of
business
and
soon
set
at
defiance
the
trammels
they
endeavoured
to
impose
upon
her
at
eighteen
she
was
as
much
mistress
of
her
own
house
as
if
she
had
been
and
although
her
old
governess
continued
to
live
with
her
at
the
earnest
request
rather
than
the
positive
command
of
her
guardians
yet
the
very
idea
of
governing
anything
never
seemed
to
enter
into
the
good
lady
head
yet
whether
in
resistance
or
compliance
in
the
display
of
her
independence
or
the
exercise
of
her
strong
good
sense
there
was
so
much
good
humour
and
even
fun
in
lady
anne
mellent
manner
that
neither
guardians
nor
relations
could
be
angry
there
was
one
indeed
of
the
former
an
old
gentleman
with
a
pigtail
and
powdered
poll
who
would
sit
and
laugh
at
her
till
the
tears
ran
over
his
cheeks
ever
and
anon
putting
on
a
grave
face
and
proposing
something
to
which
he
knew
she
would
never
consent
merely
to
excite
her
resistance
and
always
beginning
now
my
dear
young
lady
you
really
ought
but
whether
serious
or
in
jest
lady
anne
always
had
her
own
way
and
her
guardians
often
came
to
the
conclusion
that
her
own
way
was
generally
the
right
one
there
was
an
old
maiden
aunt
of
her
mother
the
only
near
female
relative
she
had
whom
one
of
her
father
executors
thought
fit
to
propose
as
a
suitable
person
to
live
with
her
and
keep
up
her
establishment
but
lady
anne
at
once
replied
indeed
she
shall
not
in
the
first
place
all
the
wine
in
the
cellar
would
be
turned
sour
in
a
fortnight
in
the
next
place
she
would
spoil
all
my
prospects
of
myself
for
life
as
she
herself
calls
it
for
by
her
own
account
she
is
a
most
dangerous
rival
and
has
had
more
proposals
than
ever
i
hope
to
have
and
in
the
next
place
she
would
attempt
to
control
me
which
neither
she
nor
any
other
person
ever
shall
do
except
my
lord
and
master
if
i
should
some
day
happen
to
have
such
a
thing
in
short
lady
anne
mellent
was
a
very
pretty
nice
clever
independent
girl
whom
many
people
considered
completely
spoiled
by
fate
fortune
and
her
relations
and
who
might
have
been
so
if
a
high
and
noble
heart
a
kind
and
generous
spirit
and
a
clear
and
rapid
intellect
would
have
permitted
it
she
loved
and
respected
maria
monkton
who
was
a
little
older
would
often
take
her
advice
when
she
would
take
that
of
no
other
person
frequently
in
conversation
with
others
set
her
immeasurably
above
herself
and
yet
often
would
call
her
to
her
face
a
dear
gentle
loveable
little
thing
her
last
vagary
before
she
came
of
age
was
to
take
a
tour
upon
the
continent
with
her
old
governess
a
maid
and
three
her
guardians
would
here
certainly
have
interfered
had
she
ever
condescended
to
make
them
acquainted
with
her
intentions
but
the
expedition
was
plotted
all
her
arrangements
were
made
and
she
herself
was
in
the
heart
of
paris
before
they
knew
anything
of
the
matter
in
writing
to
the
old
gentleman
with
the
pigtail
she
said
you
will
not
be
at
all
surprised
to
learn
that
i
am
here
on
my
way
to
rome
and
naples
and
i
think
as
i
have
nobody
with
me
but
hughes
and
my
maid
and
the
other
servants
i
shall
enjoy
my
tour
very
much
charles
marston
my
old
playfellow
was
here
the
other
day
and
very
delightful
nearly
as
mad
as
myself
he
intends
to
go
heaven
knows
where
but
first
to
damascus
because
it
is
the
only
place
where
one
can
eat
plums
if
anybody
asks
you
where
i
am
you
can
say
that
i
have
run
away
with
him
and
that
you
have
my
own
authority
for
it
then
none
will
believe
a
word
of
it
which
they
otherwise
might
send
me
plenty
of
money
to
milan
for
i
intend
to
buy
all
rome
and
set
it
up
in
the
great
at
harley
lodge
as
a
specimen
of
the
true
antique
enough
however
of
the
gay
girl
and
almost
enough
of
the
chapter
there
is
only
one
person
i
believe
whom
i
have
not
mentioned
sufficiently
hayley
fate
was
sad
but
not
undeserved
in
vain
fortune
made
a
perverse
effort
to
befriend
him
in
vain
matters
turned
out
favourable
which
had
once
looked
very
dark
the
worm
that
perisheth
not
was
in
his
heart
and
it
consumed
him
he
strove
to
establish
a
prosperous
business
for
himself
separated
from
scriven
and
he
succeeded
to
a
certain
extent
but
he
had
no
spirit
to
attend
to
anything
long
he
neglected
everything
himself
his
affairs
the
affairs
of
others
his
friends
acquaintances
his
own
person
he
became
slovenly
in
habits
and
appearance
people
said
he
drank
business
fell
off
correspondents
would
not
trust
him
and
after
a
struggle
of
eight
years
he
retired
upon
a
pittance
gave
himself
up
to
intemperance
went
mad
died
such
was
the
end
of
one
to
whom
not
years
before
had
been
opened
a
brighter
career
than
his
hopes
had
ever
pictured
the
reader
may
not
exactly
see
how
several
of
the
characters
and
events
which
have
passed
across
the
stage
in
this
phantasmagoria
can
have
any
influence
upon
the
story
that
is
to
follow
but
let
him
wait
patiently
and
he
will
see
that
not
one
word
which
has
been
written
could
have
been
properly
omitted
and
for
the
present
let
him
remember
that
just
years
and
a
few
months
had
passed
since
the
death
of
the
elder
scriven
so
that
his
son
was
now
a
man
of
middle
age
and
his
only
surviving
daughter
approaching
her
grand
climacteric
that
his
grandson
charles
marston
was
now
and
his
maria
monkton
not
quite
chapter
vii
a
fine
but
yet
a
solemn
evening
trod
upon
the
steps
of
a
may
day
there
was
a
red
light
in
the
west
under
deep
purple
clouds
overhead
all
was
blue
intense
and
unbroken
even
by
a
feathery
vapour
a
star
a
planet
faint
from
the
sun
rays
still
unrecalled
was
seen
struggling
to
shine
and
a
lingering
chillness
came
upon
the
breeze
as
it
swept
over
a
wide
heath
the
road
from
london
to
southampton
might
be
traced
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
abrupt
knolls
into
thousands
of
which
the
heath
was
broken
winding
on
for
four
or
five
miles
on
either
side
and
dim
plantations
bounded
the
prospect
between
nothing
caught
the
eye
but
the
wavy
expanse
of
uncultivated
ground
except
where
in
a
little
sandy
dell
through
which
poured
a
small
white
line
of
water
appeared
a
low
thatch
and
four
ruinous
walls
at
first
one
thought
it
a
cowshed
or
a
pigsty
but
a
filmy
wave
of
smoke
showed
it
to
be
a
human
habitation
the
nest
of
the
wild
bird
the
hole
of
the
fox
the
lair
of
the
deer
is
more
warm
and
sheltered
and
secure
than
it
was
a
carriage
came
in
sight
from
the
side
of
southampton
dashing
along
with
four
horses
at
first
it
looked
in
the
distance
like
a
husk
of
hempseed
drawn
by
four
fleas
but
as
it
came
rattling
on
it
turned
out
a
handsome
vehicle
and
a
good
team
the
top
was
loaded
with
boxes
imperials
and
all
sorts
of
leathern
contrivances
for
holding
superfluities
towering
to
the
skies
underneath
was
a
long
square
flat
basket
of
wicker
likewise
loaded
heavily
the
carriage
dashed
on
over
one
slope
down
another
across
a
sharp
channel
left
by
a
stream
of
water
which
had
flowed
down
two
or
three
days
before
after
heavy
rains
up
part
of
a
hill
and
there
it
suddenly
stopped
toppled
and
went
over
the
axle
had
broken
and
a
hind
wheel
had
come
off
the
servant
flew
out
of
his
leathern
cage
behind
lighted
in
a
huge
tuft
of
heath
somewhat
like
his
own
whiskers
and
then
got
up
and
rubbed
his
shoulder
then
a
gay
joyous
mellow
voice
was
heard
calling
out
from
the
inside
spilt
upon
my
life
what
a
crash
are
you
hurt
winkworth
venus
and
all
the
graces
smashed
to
pieces
for
a
thousand
pounds
ha
ha
ha
well
this
is
a
consummation
here
boy
open
the
door
and
let
us
out
i
always
lie
on
my
right
side
i
think
winkworth
you
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
uncommonly
said
a
voice
from
below
i
thought
you
and
but
something
about
you
boy
is
heavy
enough
by
this
time
the
postboys
were
out
of
their
saddles
and
the
servant
was
hobbling
up
the
door
was
opened
and
forth
came
a
tall
young
man
dressed
in
gay
travelling
costume
who
instantly
turned
round
to
assist
somebody
else
out
of
the
broken
vehicle
the
next
person
who
appeared
upon
the
stage
was
a
man
of
sixty
or
more
spare
wrinkled
yellow
with
very
white
hair
and
a
face
close
shaved
if
he
were
ugly
it
was
from
age
and
perhaps
bad
health
the
colour
of
his
skin
being
certainly
somewhat
sickly
but
his
features
were
good
and
his
eye
was
clear
and
even
merry
though
a
few
testy
lines
appeared
round
the
lips
he
stooped
a
good
deal
which
made
him
look
short
though
he
had
once
been
tall
but
in
no
other
respect
did
bodily
strength
seem
decayed
for
he
was
as
active
as
a
bird
no
sooner
was
his
younger
companion
out
of
the
chaise
than
he
was
seen
issuing
forth
all
legs
and
arms
together
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
possible
and
the
whole
process
was
accomplished
in
a
moment
pish
cried
the
elderly
man
peevishly
pretty
reception
to
native
land
after
years
absence
it
has
had
time
to
forget
you
said
the
younger
laughing
to
break
down
on
the
first
road
i
come
to
went
on
the
other
it
is
all
because
you
overloaded
the
carriage
so
i
should
have
done
better
to
have
travelled
by
the
stage
or
any
other
conveyance
instead
of
taking
a
seat
in
your
vehicle
the
stage
might
have
been
overloaded
and
broken
too
rejoined
the
other
take
all
the
rubs
of
life
quietly
winkworth
something
must
be
done
however
one
of
you
fellows
ride
on
and
get
the
first
blacksmith
you
can
find
send
a
chaise
too
to
meet
us
we
walk
on
you
jerry
stay
with
the
carriage
and
when
it
is
mended
bring
it
on
you
not
hurt
are
you
my
shoulder
sir
has
suffered
from
too
close
an
intimacy
with
mother
earth
replied
the
servant
in
an
affected
tone
and
my
leg
i
take
it
is
of
a
different
figure
from
the
ordinary
run
but
i
dare
say
all
will
come
straight
with
time
puppy
grumbled
the
old
gentleman
and
began
walking
on
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
he
was
soon
overtaken
by
his
young
companion
and
as
they
walked
on
together
the
postboy
overtook
and
passed
them
they
said
little
but
winkworth
looked
about
him
and
seemed
to
enjoy
the
prospect
notwithstanding
the
accident
which
had
forced
it
upon
his
contemplation
the
postboy
trotted
on
and
the
two
gentlemen
walked
forward
night
was
falling
fast
and
just
when
the
messenger
sent
for
the
chaise
had
disappeared
on
one
side
and
the
carriage
with
its
accompaniments
on
the
other
a
bifurcation
of
the
road
without
a
presented
itself
now
charles
lovel
marston
what
is
to
be
done
said
the
old
gentleman
you
and
i
are
two
fools
my
dear
sir
or
we
should
have
mounted
the
two
posters
and
let
the
postboys
get
themselves
out
of
the
scrape
they
had
got
themselves
into
it
is
just
as
bad
to
gallop
along
a
wrong
road
as
to
walk
along
one
replied
his
young
companion
with
a
laugh
only
one
goes
farther
and
faster
to
the
devil
the
old
gentleman
laughed
heartily
there
is
something
on
there
which
looks
like
he
said
it
may
be
a
stunted
tree
or
a
milestone
but
we
may
as
well
ask
it
the
way
and
putting
on
his
spectacles
he
walked
forward
with
his
head
raised
to
see
the
better
charles
marston
followed
and
for
a
minute
or
two
both
were
inclined
to
think
the
form
they
saw
would
turn
out
a
mere
stump
after
all
so
motionless
did
it
appear
on
a
nearer
approach
however
a
human
figure
became
more
distinct
it
was
that
of
a
woman
old
and
evidently
very
poor
sitting
motionless
on
the
top
of
a
little
hillock
her
hand
supporting
her
chin
and
her
eyes
bent
upon
the
ground
the
grey
hair
escaped
from
under
the
torn
cap
the
face
was
broad
especially
about
the
forehead
the
eyes
were
large
and
black
the
skin
naturally
brown
was
now
yellow
and
wrinkled
and
the
hand
which
supported
the
head
while
the
other
lay
languidly
on
the
lap
was
covered
with
a
soiled
and
tattered
kid
glove
round
her
shoulders
was
an
old
dirty
shawl
mended
and
patched
and
the
rest
of
her
garmenture
was
in
as
dilapidated
a
state
she
took
not
the
least
notice
of
the
two
travellers
though
they
stood
and
gazed
at
her
for
a
full
minute
ere
they
spoke
at
length
winkworth
raised
his
voice
and
asked
can
you
tell
us
which
is
the
london
road
my
good
woman
the
poor
creature
lifted
her
eyes
and
looked
at
them
with
a
scared
wandering
expression
they
shaved
his
head
she
said
in
the
most
melancholy
tone
in
the
world
indeed
they
did
they
thought
he
was
mad
but
it
was
only
remorse
remorse
he
never
held
up
his
head
after
he
was
quite
sure
the
poor
boy
was
dead
he
whom
he
had
wronged
and
blighted
and
killed
she
paused
and
began
to
weep
she
mad
poor
thing
said
winkworth
she
should
not
be
left
on
this
common
alone
he
saved
his
own
life
at
the
boy
expense
said
the
woman
again
but
what
a
heart
he
had
ever
after
wine
would
not
quiet
it
spirits
would
not
keep
it
up
but
when
he
found
the
boy
was
dead
then
was
the
time
of
suffering
and
they
thought
he
was
mad
when
he
raved
about
it
but
remorse
will
rave
as
well
as
madness
and
they
shaved
his
head
and
put
a
strait
waistcoat
on
him
and
one
of
the
keepers
knocked
him
down
when
he
struggled
and
he
died
in
the
night
you
know
it
was
no
fault
of
mine
she
added
looking
straight
at
the
old
man
as
if
he
had
accused
her
i
could
not
leave
him
in
his
misery
because
he
was
sinful
he
was
my
own
brother
you
know
no
no
i
could
not
do
that
of
whom
are
you
speaking
my
good
woman
asked
the
younger
gentleman
in
a
commonplace
tone
why
my
brother
to
be
sure
said
the
poor
woman
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
bewildered
surprise
whom
else
should
i
be
talking
of
ay
ay
he
was
a
rich
man
once
till
he
took
to
gambling
stay
here
is
some
one
coming
said
the
old
gentleman
this
is
a
sad
sight
charles
marston
this
poor
woman
has
seen
better
days
this
is
a
bit
of
a
real
cashmere
shawl
she
has
over
her
shoulders
i
should
know
one
when
i
see
it
i
think
we
can
not
leave
her
here
alone
ask
this
boy
who
comes
trudging
along
if
he
has
ever
seen
her
before
or
knows
anything
about
her
come
bessy
come
in
i
have
got
for
the
eggs
so
i
bought
a
loaf
and
an
ounce
of
tea
do
sit
moping
there
it
cold
bessy
his
tone
was
very
kind
and
affectionate
and
the
two
gentlemen
examined
him
as
well
as
they
could
by
the
failing
light
he
was
a
lad
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
of
age
short
but
seemingly
strong
and
and
his
countenance
as
far
as
they
could
see
was
frank
and
intelligent
his
clothing
was
both
scanty
and
poor
but
it
was
well
patched
and
mended
and
he
had
a
pair
of
stout
shoes
on
his
feet
i
coming
jim
i
coming
my
dear
replied
the
old
woman
in
quite
a
different
tone
from
that
in
which
she
had
been
speaking
to
the
strangers
i
just
went
out
to
get
a
little
fresh
air
and
i
found
another
nest
and
put
all
the
eggs
on
the
shelf
my
man
the
two
gentlemen
called
the
boy
to
them
and
in
a
low
tone
asked
several
questions
about
the
poor
creature
whom
he
called
bessy
especially
the
younger
one
who
seemed
a
good
deal
interested
the
elder
inquired
whether
she
was
his
mother
or
any
relation
the
boy
replied
that
she
was
not
and
his
little
history
was
soon
told
she
had
come
about
their
cottage
he
said
three
or
four
years
before
and
had
slept
one
night
upon
the
heath
his
mother
who
was
then
living
had
been
kind
to
her
and
had
taken
her
in
we
had
two
cows
then
said
the
boy
and
used
to
feed
them
on
the
common
and
it
was
a
good
year
and
poor
bessy
used
to
do
what
she
could
to
help
she
a
famous
hand
with
her
needle
and
mended
all
the
clothes
my
mother
had
a
little
washing
and
we
got
on
well
enough
what
between
the
butter
and
the
washing
and
a
few
vegetables
out
of
the
garden
but
a
year
ago
last
christmas
mother
died
and
i
and
bessy
have
lived
here
alone
as
well
as
we
can
she
is
not
at
all
dangerous
and
at
times
quite
right
and
she
helps
me
to
find
eggs
and
to
watch
and
all
that
she
can
she
mends
the
clothes
and
does
many
little
things
and
she
has
taught
me
to
read
and
write
in
her
well
times
when
she
at
the
worst
she
can
always
read
the
bible
of
a
night
i
sure
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
her
since
mother
died
was
she
better
dressed
when
she
first
came
to
your
cottage
asked
charles
marston
oh
to
be
sure
replied
the
boy
but
her
clothes
are
worn
out
now
poor
thing
well
we
come
and
rest
at
your
cottage
said
winkworth
our
carriage
has
broken
down
on
the
common
and
we
sent
for
a
chaise
the
boy
seemed
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
and
then
said
it
is
a
poor
place
the
gentlemen
however
persisted
and
again
rousing
the
poor
old
woman
who
had
once
more
fallen
into
a
fit
of
gloomy
thought
the
lad
led
them
to
the
hut
of
which
mention
has
been
made
in
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
it
was
a
poor
place
as
he
had
said
as
poor
as
it
could
be
the
unmended
windows
in
spite
of
rags
and
paper
let
in
the
winds
of
night
the
door
leaned
back
upon
its
heels
like
a
drunken
man
trying
to
stand
soberly
the
thatch
was
worn
through
in
many
places
and
it
was
a
happy
time
when
it
did
not
rain
in
short
it
had
been
originally
but
a
hovel
of
clay
of
the
poorest
kind
now
it
was
still
poorer
and
when
the
boy
and
the
old
woman
together
for
she
helped
him
had
lighted
a
fire
with
some
bundles
of
dry
heath
and
the
flame
rose
high
and
flickered
round
the
broken
walls
the
two
men
accustomed
to
luxury
and
ease
and
comfort
of
every
kind
felt
a
shuddering
impression
of
the
evils
to
which
their
are
often
subject
which
was
likely
to
do
both
their
hearts
no
harm
the
boy
was
communicative
enough
and
told
all
that
he
knew
with
quiet
intelligence
but
they
could
get
the
old
woman
to
speak
no
more
she
answered
every
question
with
a
monosyllable
and
then
fell
into
silence
again
they
did
not
leave
the
hovel
as
destitute
as
they
found
it
they
had
with
them
neither
provisions
nor
furniture
nor
suitable
clothing
to
give
but
they
had
that
most
malleable
of
metals
which
when
properly
hammered
out
spreads
into
meat
drink
and
clothing
nor
were
they
satisfied
with
this
when
they
reached
a
little
town
the
old
gentleman
with
the
yellow
face
sent
for
a
bricklayer
gave
him
some
orders
in
a
low
tone
and
wrote
down
an
address
upon
a
piece
of
paper
the
younger
one
talked
for
with
the
landlady
in
the
bar
and
next
morning
paid
her
four
pounds
nine
shillings
more
than
his
own
bill
that
was
a
happy
day
for
the
poor
people
of
the
cottage
on
which
charles
marston
and
his
old
companion
broke
down
upon
the
heath
chapter
viii
there
is
a
small
house
in
the
purlieus
of
fashion
surrounded
on
every
side
by
mansions
five
times
as
big
as
itself
you
know
it
quite
well
dear
reader
you
have
passed
it
a
dozen
times
or
more
and
looked
up
and
wondered
what
it
did
there
surrounded
as
it
is
by
the
mansions
of
ancient
aristocracy
for
the
part
of
the
town
in
which
it
is
situated
is
not
one
of
the
new
rookeries
of
new
people
which
have
risen
up
to
the
and
of
the
capital
upon
spots
that
were
fields
within
these
thirty
years
it
is
tall
and
thin
and
brown
like
a
spinster
of
a
certain
age
at
a
county
ball
amongst
a
row
of
bland
and
brilliant
dowagers
quite
the
sort
of
house
in
short
which
the
wonderful
george
robins
would
have
advertised
for
sale
as
a
unique
bachelor
residence
situate
in
the
very
heart
of
the
fashionable
world
commanding
advantages
rarely
met
with
singly
but
never
perhaps
united
except
in
this
most
charming
abode
nevertheless
it
was
not
the
residence
of
a
bachelor
at
all
nor
of
a
married
man
nor
of
a
spinster
old
or
young
it
was
the
town
house
and
indeed
the
only
house
of
a
very
excellent
and
respectable
widow
lady
with
a
moderate
income
and
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
but
not
the
best
wits
to
guide
them
having
spoken
of
her
income
i
must
make
that
matter
quite
clear
she
had
just
seven
hundred
and
would
not
indeed
have
had
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
care
and
circumspection
of
a
very
prudent
brother
who
had
interfered
to
see
the
affairs
of
her
marriage
settlement
properly
conducted
i
need
not
add
after
this
that
there
dwelt
lady
fleetwood
when
she
was
alone
her
household
consisted
of
a
footman
well
powdered
and
laced
a
cook
a
housemaid
and
her
own
maid
a
somewhat
extravagant
establishment
considering
her
income
but
in
all
other
things
she
was
very
economical
at
least
she
thought
so
and
maria
monkton
fully
agreed
in
her
opinion
she
did
not
pamper
any
of
the
appetites
nor
indeed
any
of
the
vanities
of
the
flesh
except
in
the
instance
of
the
powdered
footman
her
table
was
always
regulated
with
great
exactness
and
her
certain
number
of
glasses
of
wine
was
never
exceeded
her
dresses
by
the
skill
of
her
maid
appeared
in
various
forms
with
very
great
success
and
when
maria
was
with
her
there
was
always
a
carriage
at
her
command
nor
in
truth
when
maria
was
at
bolton
park
did
lady
fleetwood
go
without
for
a
chariot
and
a
pair
of
horses
were
always
left
at
the
stables
with
a
particular
request
from
the
niece
that
her
aunt
would
use
them
every
day
lest
the
horses
should
grow
frisky
for
want
of
exercise
when
maria
was
in
town
however
the
case
was
different
three
or
four
servants
were
always
in
the
hall
the
whole
establishment
was
increased
the
little
house
had
more
occupants
than
it
seemed
capable
of
containing
more
indeed
than
it
really
did
contain
at
night
and
then
as
this
was
all
for
maria
monkton
convenience
maria
monkton
insisted
upon
paying
the
whole
expenses
now
as
upon
an
average
maria
was
eight
months
out
of
the
twelve
with
her
aunt
and
two
or
three
of
the
remaining
four
lady
fleetwood
passed
at
bolton
park
the
fact
of
her
income
fully
meeting
her
expenditure
and
leaving
her
a
little
surplus
at
the
end
of
the
year
may
be
accounted
for
lady
fleetwood
it
is
true
did
not
understand
it
altogether
and
would
sometimes
run
up
her
accounts
with
a
somewhat
bewildered
air
and
in
the
end
give
up
the
task
acknowledging
that
she
never
had
a
head
for
figures
it
might
be
a
little
wrong
of
maria
thus
to
mystify
her
aunt
but
she
was
a
dear
good
girl
notwithstanding
and
accustomed
to
pet
lady
fleetwood
from
her
own
childhood
she
well
knew
there
was
only
one
way
of
managing
her
and
what
that
way
was
she
even
went
farther
than
saving
her
good
aunt
income
for
her
by
taking
the
greater
share
of
all
her
expenses
upon
herself
she
calculated
that
one
of
two
events
one
very
common
and
one
universal
might
occur
to
herself
that
she
might
die
or
that
she
might
marry
and
to
put
it
out
of
the
power
of
any
one
to
leave
her
aunt
in
embarrassed
circumstances
her
first
act
on
coming
of
age
was
to
settle
upon
her
without
her
knowing
a
word
of
the
matter
a
sufficient
sum
to
make
her
income
a
very
comfortable
one
in
the
month
of
may
then
about
the
middle
of
the
day
lady
fleetwood
was
seated
in
her
writing
little
notes
an
occupation
of
which
she
was
rather
fond
maria
was
out
of
town
but
expected
to
return
on
that
day
or
the
following
morning
and
all
was
duly
prepared
for
her
reception
the
curtains
of
the
room
were
partly
drawn
to
keep
out
too
much
light
for
the
house
was
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
square
and
in
the
mitigated
glow
lady
fleetwood
though
her
hair
was
now
very
grey
and
the
wrinkled
impress
of
time
claw
was
on
her
fair
skin
showed
many
traces
of
that
great
beauty
which
had
once
distinguished
her
she
had
just
sealed
one
small
billet
and
begun
a
second
when
she
heard
the
near
rush
of
wheels
through
the
roll
of
many
others
more
distant
and
a
carriage
stopped
at
her
own
door
it
was
too
early
for
ordinary
visiters
who
with
a
due
economy
of
time
always
choose
the
hour
to
call
when
they
are
likely
to
find
their
dear
friends
absent
it
is
maria
said
lady
fleetwood
to
herself
she
has
come
up
early
the
next
instant
the
door
was
flung
open
but
not
by
a
servant
and
without
announcement
a
young
and
man
entered
with
a
light
and
gay
step
and
threw
wide
open
his
arms
before
the
good
lady
here
i
am
my
dear
aunt
here
i
am
cried
charles
marston
safe
and
sound
from
perils
by
land
and
perils
by
water
perils
by
robbers
perils
by
cooks
and
perils
by
chambermaids
come
to
the
nepotal
arms
and
banish
all
anxieties
upon
the
bosom
of
kindred
love
charles
charles
you
mad
boy
cried
lady
fleetwood
embracing
him
tenderly
how
can
you
startle
me
so
you
know
how
nervous
i
am
why
you
have
come
back
six
months
before
you
intended
and
three
days
answered
charles
laughing
which
means
to
say
my
dear
aunt
flee
that
you
think
i
have
come
back
six
months
too
soon
i
be
affronted
i
pout
really
i
never
as
the
kellnerin
at
brixen
said
when
i
kissed
her
before
company
this
is
the
coolest
reception
of
a
returned
prodigal
that
ever
i
heard
of
how
can
you
be
so
absurd
charles
exclaimed
his
aunt
what
is
a
kellnerin
where
is
brixen
do
you
mean
brixton
charles
burst
into
a
shout
of
laughter
patted
his
aunt
cheek
in
the
most
paternal
manner
and
led
her
back
to
her
seat
by
the
tips
of
her
fingers
have
time
my
dear
aunt
have
time
he
said
i
tell
you
all
about
kellnerins
and
brixens
if
you
a
good
girl
just
now
i
got
a
particular
friend
and
travelling
companion
in
the
carriage
with
me
winkworth
the
most
extraordinary
piece
of
yellow
skin
and
dry
bones
you
ever
saw
he
comes
from
egypt
and
i
have
brought
him
over
intending
to
present
him
to
the
british
museum
or
the
zoological
society
either
as
an
extraordinary
and
almost
unique
specimen
of
the
fossil
man
or
the
only
instance
in
europe
of
the
living
mummy
i
must
bring
him
and
introduce
him
to
you
and
you
must
ask
him
to
dinner
i
invited
him
already
in
your
name
was
not
that
a
kind
considerate
nephew
impossible
my
dear
charles
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
in
a
great
flutter
i
am
really
not
prepared
you
forget
my
dear
boy
my
small
means
i
am
not
always
ready
to
receive
people
at
dinner
a
stranger
too
there
is
no
turbot
nothing
but
some
slices
of
cod
and
never
mind
never
mind
my
dear
aunt
it
will
do
quite
well
cod
is
excellent
exclaimed
charles
marston
i
have
not
tasted
cod
for
a
year
and
a
half
and
i
answer
for
it
my
mummy
has
not
seen
such
a
thing
since
he
was
cook
to
one
of
the
ptolemies
i
forget
which
but
he
tell
you
all
about
it
i
go
and
bring
heaven
and
earth
i
do
believe
the
carriage
is
driving
off
and
he
ran
as
fast
as
possible
but
only
to
see
his
driving
round
the
square
at
a
very
rapid
rate
why
where
are
they
gone
what
the
devil
the
matter
with
them
cried
charles
the
gentleman
inside
told
the
boys
to
drive
him
to
lloyd
hotel
sir
said
lady
fleetwood
servant
just
on
the
opposite
side
sir
the
carriage
will
be
back
in
a
minute
well
the
old
gentleman
must
have
his
own
way
i
suppose
said
charles
marston
and
so
i
go
up
to
my
dear
aunt
again
well
now
my
dear
aunt
he
gone
continued
the
nephew
in
a
mock
reproachful
tone
i
am
quite
sure
he
heard
all
you
said
and
thought
it
very
inhospitable
nonsense
charles
he
could
not
hear
i
am
sure
replied
lady
fleetwood
going
to
the
window
to
see
if
it
were
open
is
that
your
carriage
why
it
is
loaded
like
a
wagon
well
it
may
be
answered
her
nephew
or
more
like
a
licensed
to
carry
twelve
outside
for
there
are
the
nine
muses
and
the
three
graces
i
am
afraid
it
would
come
under
the
penalties
of
the
act
however
for
there
are
moreover
two
or
three
apollos
venuses
to
say
nothing
of
seneca
and
aristides
osiris
and
acis
and
galatea
i
intend
my
dear
aunt
to
have
them
all
arranged
here
in
this
very
your
room
will
look
like
a
walhalla
or
a
studio
or
a
greek
temple
or
spode
manufactory
or
a
shop
and
you
shall
have
a
helmet
and
a
shield
and
an
owl
and
pass
for
minerva
indeed
charles
you
are
mad
i
think
said
lady
fleetwood
the
room
is
small
enough
as
it
is
without
being
loaded
with
graces
and
muses
and
all
sorts
of
things
tell
my
servant
to
open
the
cases
when
he
comes
back
cried
unpitying
charles
marston
as
lady
fleetwood
footman
entered
with
a
note
and
bid
him
get
seven
men
to
help
him
and
bring
up
the
statues
i
always
have
my
own
way
my
dear
aunt
i
will
see
your
room
classically
decorated
and
then
if
you
do
not
like
your
marble
palace
you
can
throw
the
statues
out
of
the
window
or
get
in
a
number
of
porters
to
do
it
for
you
they
will
be
capital
metal
for
macadamising
the
roads
then
the
people
will
say
you
have
been
playing
at
marbles
you
know
and
it
will
all
pass
off
as
a
joke
charles
charles
do
let
me
have
one
moment
peace
to
read
what
maria
says
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
really
i
had
forgotten
what
a
wild
creature
you
are
or
else
you
are
worse
than
ever
mere
exuberance
of
spirits
my
dear
aunt
at
seeing
you
and
england
once
more
replied
charles
marston
but
i
be
serious
nay
i
am
quite
serious
what
does
maria
say
where
is
she
when
shall
i
have
the
pleasure
of
giving
her
a
kiss
it
is
not
every
man
who
has
the
privilege
of
kissing
such
a
lovely
girl
gratis
i
long
for
it
i
assure
you
nay
i
am
quite
serious
i
have
several
very
serious
things
to
talk
to
you
about
most
profound
but
somehow
my
dear
aunt
flee
when
i
see
you
i
get
quite
boyish
again
you
are
so
charming
it
a
pity
the
says
we
must
not
marry
our
sister
you
are
the
only
woman
who
would
suit
me
in
the
whole
world
indeed
you
there
i
as
grave
as
a
judge
read
your
note
read
your
note
and
tell
me
all
about
maria
afterwards
and
sitting
down
charles
bent
his
head
gazed
at
his
clasped
hands
and
fell
into
a
fit
of
thought
to
all
appearance
much
more
deep
than
his
rattling
manner
would
have
led
one
to
suppose
his
mind
capable
of
sustaining
for
two
minutes
there
maria
does
not
return
till
said
lady
fleetwood
finishing
the
reading
of
her
note
then
i
shall
have
you
and
the
cod
all
to
myself
replied
charles
marston
looking
up
with
one
of
his
gay
laughs
but
instantly
resuming
a
more
serious
tone
he
said
and
now
my
dear
aunt
i
have
three
very
grave
subjects
to
talk
to
you
about
indeed
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
putting
on
an
important
look
what
may
they
be
charles
i
am
sure
i
am
ready
to
give
you
any
advice
in
my
power
dear
creature
cried
charles
marston
as
if
she
thought
i
ever
took
anybody
advice
but
to
the
point
has
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
frank
middleton
called
to
inquire
for
me
within
the
last
week
or
two
oh
dear
yes
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
he
called
yesterday
i
forgot
to
tell
you
as
if
she
had
had
time
to
tell
me
anything
said
charles
his
card
is
in
the
dish
continued
lady
fleetwood
there
is
no
address
on
it
or
i
would
have
written
to
him
to
say
you
were
not
expected
for
some
months
that
would
have
been
kind
said
her
nephew
now
how
the
deuce
am
i
to
find
him
out
oh
he
will
call
again
he
said
he
would
call
in
a
day
or
two
replied
his
aunt
wise
frank
middleton
exclaimed
charles
he
seems
to
have
divined
you
my
dear
aunt
lady
fleetwood
looked
bewildered
and
now
continued
her
nephew
can
you
tell
me
what
my
mysterious
uncle
scriven
wrote
to
me
for
to
come
back
directly
as
he
wanted
to
see
me
on
particular
business
i
always
like
to
meet
my
excellent
uncle
prepared
with
full
forethought
of
what
is
to
come
next
and
he
was
as
dark
in
his
communication
as
the
sphinx
mouth
no
did
he
send
for
you
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
he
did
not
tell
me
a
word
about
it
how
strange
i
saw
him
only
yesterday
and
was
talking
about
you
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
he
was
always
very
close
and
discreet
you
know
charles
wise
man
said
charles
marston
and
he
fell
into
thought
again
for
a
moment
or
two
pray
my
dear
aunt
what
was
he
saying
about
me
he
inquired
after
this
pause
oh
i
do
recollect
nothing
particular
i
believe
replied
lady
fleetwood
the
colour
growing
a
little
deeper
in
her
cheek
ho
ho
a
secret
said
charles
to
himself
and
then
continued
aloud
well
my
dear
aunt
i
know
you
have
a
short
memory
and
i
know
my
uncle
never
tells
you
anything
of
importance
for
he
says
you
forget
it
as
soon
as
you
hear
it
he
is
very
wrong
there
said
lady
fleetwood
who
rather
piqued
herself
upon
her
powers
of
recollection
for
i
never
forget
anything
then
what
was
it
he
said
inquired
charles
abruptly
oh
i
do
not
know
it
was
intended
for
your
ears
replied
lady
fleetwood
or
that
maria
would
like
such
a
thing
to
be
talked
about
then
it
was
about
maria
too
said
charles
with
a
laugh
now
i
know
all
about
it
it
was
that
maria
was
dying
with
love
for
me
and
that
i
was
wandering
all
over
the
world
flirting
with
every
pretty
woman
i
met
well
i
dare
say
she
will
not
be
much
obliged
to
him
for
saying
that
he
did
not
say
that
at
all
my
dear
charles
replied
lady
fleetwood
in
a
little
alarm
he
only
said
what
a
good
thing
it
would
be
if
you
and
maria
were
to
marry
and
i
thought
so
too
for
you
are
very
fond
of
each
other
and
you
are
both
and
poor
orphans
exclaimed
charles
marston
laughing
heartily
well
matrimony
is
as
good
as
any
other
orphan
asylum
i
do
think
it
will
do
my
dear
aunt
we
are
more
like
brother
and
sister
than
lovers
however
to
my
third
profound
problem
now
tell
me
dear
lady
mine
do
you
recollect
a
certain
hayley
who
was
once
my
partner
to
be
sure
answered
lady
fleetwood
do
you
charles
why
his
son
poor
henry
i
recollect
him
perfectly
dear
aunt
replied
charles
gravely
my
head
is
not
such
a
colander
nor
my
heart
either
that
people
can
slip
out
of
either
one
or
the
other
even
in
ten
years
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
had
not
hayley
a
sister
yes
to
be
sure
he
had
replied
lady
fleetwood
a
nice
quiet
good
sort
of
creature
devoted
to
her
brother
and
the
poor
boy
she
used
to
play
beautifully
upon
the
piano
and
sing
i
do
care
a
pin
about
that
said
charles
i
never
saw
her
more
than
two
or
three
times
but
what
i
wish
to
know
is
what
was
her
name
her
name
her
name
said
lady
fleetwood
her
name
was
rebecca
i
think
which
in
the
hebrew
means
said
charles
marston
well
when
i
last
saw
her
she
was
thin
enough
no
indeed
charles
she
was
quite
the
contrary
said
lady
fleetwood
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
she
was
fat
but
oh
say
she
was
fat
if
you
like
dear
aunt
replied
charles
marston
laughing
she
is
not
here
to
listen
and
i
wo
betray
you
so
it
will
not
pain
her
i
would
not
pain
a
fly
willingly
charles
answered
his
relation
i
am
sure
you
would
not
said
her
nephew
laying
his
hand
upon
hers
affectionately
but
now
the
case
is
my
dear
aunt
how
we
can
rescue
this
poor
thing
from
a
situation
of
great
misery
you
must
know
that
i
should
have
been
in
town
last
night
but
that
my
carriage
broke
down
on
a
miserable
wild
common
it
had
to
be
mended
and
while
a
blacksmith
was
being
sent
for
winkworth
and
i
wandered
on
and
met
with
a
poor
crazy
woman
in
rags
and
wretchedness
who
we
found
had
been
living
there
in
a
dilapidated
hovel
for
some
years
with
an
orphan
boy
whose
mother
had
been
very
kind
to
her
as
long
as
the
poor
thing
lived
herself
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
i
thought
that
her
face
was
not
unknown
to
me
you
remember
miss
hayley
had
very
peculiar
large
black
eyes
but
six
or
seven
years
have
passed
since
hayley
gave
up
business
altogether
and
went
to
live
over
at
highgate
and
i
have
not
seen
his
sister
since
some
words
that
she
dropped
however
led
my
mind
back
to
the
past
though
all
she
said
was
rambling
and
incoherent
and
the
more
i
think
of
this
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
poor
henry
hayley
aunt
good
gracious
cried
lady
fleetwood
that
is
very
sad
indeed
i
am
so
sorry
that
i
did
not
go
again
to
see
them
at
highgate
i
went
twice
but
never
found
her
and
she
did
not
return
my
call
and
your
uncle
was
so
angry
i
had
been
at
all
that
i
did
not
go
back
i
heard
that
hayley
himself
was
dead
some
time
ago
and
i
always
intended
to
inquire
for
his
sister
but
just
then
came
poor
isabella
death
you
know
nobody
who
knows
you
my
dear
aunt
can
suppose
you
would
be
unkind
to
any
one
replied
charles
marston
but
something
must
be
done
for
this
poor
thing
certainly
certainly
replied
lady
fleetwood
i
will
talk
to
your
uncle
about
it
and
i
am
sure
he
will
do
nothing
at
all
said
charles
almost
sharply
or
at
best
put
her
into
a
cheap
madhouse
where
she
will
be
dieted
upon
gruel
and
maltreated
by
keepers
worse
off
than
she
is
now
i
will
go
down
or
the
next
day
and
see
about
the
matter
myself
in
the
mean
time
both
winkworth
and
i
have
done
something
to
make
her
and
the
boy
more
comfortable
and
who
is
this
mr
winkworth
asked
lady
fleetwood
whose
mind
was
of
that
peculiar
species
which
may
be
called
the
collateral
one
of
those
minds
that
are
always
carried
away
to
one
side
by
the
slightest
possible
circumstance
to
which
a
word
or
a
sound
or
a
look
is
ever
one
of
hippomene
apples
and
sets
the
wits
running
after
it
with
all
the
speed
of
an
atalanta
who
is
winkworth
he
seems
to
have
become
a
great
favourite
of
yours
charles
he
has
laid
me
under
the
greatest
possible
obligation
replied
her
nephew
smiling
indeed
how
was
that
inquired
his
aunt
why
he
was
kind
enough
to
permit
me
to
save
his
life
answered
charles
you
must
know
as
i
was
riding
along
not
a
hundred
miles
from
a
place
called
antioch
which
i
dare
say
you
never
heard
of
oh
dear
yes
said
lady
fleet
wood
it
in
the
bible
yes
and
in
syria
into
the
bargain
continued
charles
but
as
i
was
saying
as
i
was
riding
along
not
a
hundred
miles
from
antioch
with
servants
and
arabs
and
all
manner
of
people
with
me
i
came
to
a
place
under
the
high
rocks
when
i
suddenly
heard
shots
fired
my
guides
thought
it
would
be
better
to
wait
a
little
till
the
firing
was
over
but
i
judged
it
proper
to
ride
on
and
see
what
it
was
about
so
when
we
turned
the
corner
of
a
great
black
overhanging
rock
like
westminster
abbey
turned
i
saw
two
or
three
unfortunate
servants
upon
the
ground
rather
silent
and
quite
still
with
about
a
dozen
other
fellows
with
blackish
faces
long
guns
and
a
great
deal
of
white
cotton
about
them
two
of
whom
were
taking
aim
at
the
only
one
of
the
travellers
left
alive
in
other
words
winkworth
who
for
his
part
was
trying
to
cover
his
angles
which
are
many
with
his
horse
he
had
got
a
long
pistol
in
his
hand
but
that
was
nothing
against
guns
you
know
my
dear
aunt
and
besides
twelve
to
one
is
not
fair
play
so
i
spurred
on
and
my
fellows
being
obliged
to
spur
after
though
a
little
unwillingly
did
very
well
when
it
came
to
fighting
and
we
drove
the
banditti
up
into
the
hills
shooting
one
or
two
of
them
we
then
came
back
and
found
my
poor
countryman
mourning
over
his
dead
he
was
wounded
himself
so
i
was
obliged
to
stay
and
nurse
him
and
we
have
travelled
together
ever
since
but
who
is
he
what
is
he
demanded
lady
fleetwood
after
she
had
exclaimed
upon
her
nephew
peril
and
praised
heaven
for
his
escape
well
my
dear
aunt
as
to
who
he
is
i
never
thought
of
inquiring
answered
charles
and
as
to
what
he
is
i
can
but
answer
he
is
certainly
a
gentleman
a
very
amiable
clever
person
a
little
testy
very
eccentric
and
old
bachelorish
but
generous
and
benevolent
and
moreover
evidently
very
rich
though
he
has
his
own
particular
ways
out
of
which
he
does
not
choose
to
be
put
well
if
he
is
rich
that
does
not
signify
said
lady
fleetwood
now
would
not
any
one
who
heard
that
think
you
the
most
mercenary
old
creature
in
the
world
exclaimed
charles
you
who
would
give
away
your
last
nightcap
to
a
beggar
but
my
dear
you
know
there
are
so
many
impostors
said
his
aunt
with
a
very
sagacious
air
every
one
of
whom
would
take
you
in
in
a
moment
replied
her
nephew
however
to
set
your
mind
at
rest
winkworth
would
not
consent
even
to
take
a
place
in
my
carriage
till
he
had
stipulated
that
he
was
to
pay
of
all
the
expenses
this
satisfied
lady
fleetwood
first
doubts
doubts
which
she
entertained
merely
upon
abstract
theory
for
she
was
or
chose
to
be
supposed
the
most
suspicious
person
in
the
world
at
a
distance
but
at
close
quarters
she
was
soon
overcome
charles
marston
carriage
had
by
this
time
returned
and
an
hour
was
spent
in
unpacking
an
imperial
the
nephew
assuring
his
aunt
that
in
ten
minutes
her
would
be
full
of
statues
and
she
poor
lady
begging
pitifully
but
in
vain
to
be
excused
from
receiving
the
three
graces
and
the
nine
muses
merciless
charles
marston
would
not
relieve
her
mind
in
the
least
till
at
length
twelve
beautiful
small
alabaster
figures
none
of
them
a
foot
high
were
brought
in
and
found
easy
accommodation
upon
consoles
and
cheffoniers
much
to
the
delight
of
the
good
lady
who
declared
that
they
were
the
most
exquisite
things
ever
seen
and
thanked
him
over
and
over
again
for
the
gift
when
all
this
was
done
lady
fleetwood
pressed
her
nephew
to
go
at
once
and
see
his
uncle
but
charles
had
a
fit
of
restiveness
upon
him
no
my
dear
aunt
i
wo
he
said
my
uncle
has
something
disagreeable
to
tell
me
or
he
would
not
have
sent
such
a
way
and
i
am
resolved
to
stay
one
day
at
peace
in
the
midst
of
the
great
capital
so
here
i
remain
unless
you
absolutely
want
to
get
rid
of
me
not
at
all
charles
of
course
replied
lady
fleetwood
but
only
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
pity
for
you
to
offend
your
uncle
you
know
that
he
has
no
other
male
relation
and
he
must
be
enormously
rich
i
really
do
not
care
whether
he
is
rich
or
poor
answered
charles
i
am
as
rich
as
or
indeed
richer
than
he
is
for
thanks
to
my
father
generosity
i
have
as
much
as
i
want
and
i
am
quite
sure
my
uncle
scriven
could
not
say
that
so
there
he
sat
discussing
many
things
with
his
aunt
telling
her
strange
stories
of
his
adventures
in
foreign
lands
all
true
indeed
but
tinged
in
the
telling
with
a
gleam
of
the
marvellous
for
the
purpose
of
exciting
lady
fleetwood
astonishment
in
that
endeavour
he
was
very
successful
for
the
organ
of
wonder
was
quite
sufficiently
developed
in
her
head
and
the
day
passed
over
very
pleasantly
till
it
was
time
for
charles
to
seek
a
lodging
for
the
night
which
he
easily
found
at
the
hotel
opposite
where
his
friend
winkworth
had
already
taken
up
his
quarters
before
he
bade
his
aunt
farewell
however
he
gave
directions
to
her
footman
if
middleton
called
to
inquire
particularly
where
he
was
to
be
found
in
london
and
to
let
him
know
that
his
two
friends
winkworth
and
marston
were
at
the
hotel
and
then
came
inquiries
from
lady
fleetwood
as
to
who
this
other
crony
of
her
nephew
could
be
i
will
not
stop
to
tell
you
all
my
dear
aunt
replied
charles
who
by
this
time
had
his
hat
in
his
hand
suffice
it
that
he
is
the
most
charming
man
you
ever
saw
take
care
you
do
not
find
him
too
charming
he
is
quite
a
don
sort
of
man
pale
dark
wonderfully
handsome
more
than
six
feet
high
with
a
across
his
face
sufficient
to
win
the
hearts
of
all
the
women
in
london
he
is
a
colonel
in
the
spanish
service
and
has
all
sorts
of
orders
and
chains
though
he
is
not
above
seven
or
i
believe
his
mother
was
a
spanish
lady
i
think
indeed
somebody
told
me
so
but
at
all
events
he
is
quite
the
person
to
fall
in
love
with
if
you
are
inclined
my
dear
aunt
my
dear
charles
how
can
you
be
so
absurd
exclaimed
his
aunt
but
now
you
have
not
told
me
how
you
met
with
him
i
keep
that
for
a
replied
charles
and
walked
away
to
his
hotel
chapter
ix
it
is
my
full
and
firm
belief
that
if
on
any
given
day
of
any
given
year
you
were
dear
reader
to
take
the
accurate
history
of
any
five
square
miles
not
exactly
a
desert
upon
the
solid
surface
of
the
earth
and
examine
with
a
microscope
the
acts
and
deeds
the
circumstances
the
accidents
and
the
fate
of
the
people
upon
it
you
would
find
strange
romances
enough
going
on
to
stock
a
library
look
into
a
cottage
what
will
you
find
perhaps
a
romance
of
love
and
tenderness
struggling
with
sorrows
difficulties
and
penury
perhaps
a
broad
farce
of
a
quarrelsome
wife
and
a
drunken
husband
perhaps
a
tragedy
of
sin
crime
and
misery
look
into
that
stately
mansion
the
house
of
a
great
merchant
what
is
there
it
may
be
the
comedy
of
affectation
it
may
be
the
tale
of
the
tenderest
affections
and
highest
qualities
or
it
may
show
that
agonizing
struggle
which
the
falling
man
makes
to
sustain
himself
upon
the
edge
of
the
precipice
at
the
foot
of
which
he
is
soon
to
lie
dashed
to
pieces
a
romance
is
but
a
microscopic
view
of
some
human
hearts
the
above
observations
may
apparently
be
wide
of
the
subject
but
still
there
must
be
some
link
of
association
between
them
and
what
is
to
follow
as
they
naturally
occurred
to
my
mind
when
considering
how
i
could
best
tell
the
events
which
are
about
to
be
related
perhaps
it
was
that
i
thought
it
somewhat
strange
that
at
the
very
moment
when
the
conversation
took
place
which
has
been
detailed
in
the
last
chapter
one
of
the
personages
therein
mentioned
was
up
to
the
neck
if
i
may
so
express
it
in
an
adventure
which
though
trifling
in
itself
was
destined
like
many
another
trifle
to
work
a
great
effect
on
the
destinies
of
many
it
was
a
beautiful
evening
then
about
the
of
may
the
spring
had
been
somewhat
rainy
and
boisterous
and
the
few
preceding
days
though
clear
had
been
cold
especially
towards
the
afternoon
but
it
would
seem
that
winter
had
puffed
forth
his
last
blast
for
the
summer
had
got
full
possession
of
the
day
and
held
it
to
the
end
the
birds
which
had
been
nearly
silent
on
the
were
now
in
full
song
the
starred
the
and
the
banks
and
if
a
cloud
came
over
the
blue
sky
it
was
as
soft
and
fleecy
as
a
lamb
first
coat
under
this
summer
heaven
there
was
a
very
beautiful
lane
an
english
country
road
running
between
two
banks
on
the
top
of
each
of
which
keeping
parallel
with
the
road
was
a
paling
above
which
again
spread
the
arms
of
tall
trees
holding
their
broad
leafy
fans
over
the
head
of
the
traveller
below
by
the
distance
of
the
bolls
of
the
old
elms
and
beeches
from
the
fence
which
guarded
them
it
appeared
as
if
there
was
a
good
broad
walk
within
the
boundary
and
when
the
banks
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
slanted
down
so
as
to
bring
the
paling
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
lane
that
walk
might
be
seen
together
with
a
view
over
the
gravel
to
a
green
and
shady
park
dotted
with
fallow
deer
coming
down
the
lane
was
a
carrier
cart
with
the
drag
on
for
there
was
a
somewhat
steep
descent
and
the
road
was
as
smooth
as
a
floor
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
where
the
carrier
stopped
to
remove
the
shoe
was
a
gentleman
who
also
paused
and
asked
him
some
questions
in
the
mean
time
somewhat
higher
up
and
within
the
enclosure
as
if
taking
an
evening
walk
was
a
lady
a
young
and
very
beautiful
lady
with
some
traces
of
mourning
about
her
apparel
although
its
general
hue
was
light
there
was
a
certain
harmony
between
her
dress
and
her
air
and
expression
for
though
the
dark
hazel
eyes
and
the
rich
glossy
brown
hair
the
warm
healthy
cheek
and
the
arched
lips
of
the
small
mouth
had
altogether
a
cheerful
look
yet
there
was
a
shade
of
melancholy
thought
in
maria
monkton
fair
face
as
she
walked
through
the
scenes
where
every
object
that
she
saw
every
step
that
she
took
was
full
of
memories
of
early
days
and
childhood
joys
and
friends
departed
they
are
always
melancholy
pleasures
those
of
memory
for
they
are
the
rays
of
a
star
that
has
set
with
her
eyes
bent
down
then
and
a
slow
step
she
walked
on
took
a
little
path
to
the
left
through
the
trees
till
it
led
her
to
the
more
open
part
of
the
park
and
then
stopped
to
gaze
over
the
scene
the
broad
lands
which
she
saw
were
all
her
own
the
herds
of
deer
were
hers
that
was
her
mansion
an
angle
of
which
peeped
over
the
old
oaks
but
yet
the
sight
and
the
knowledge
were
not
altogether
pleasurable
though
it
might
seem
that
they
ought
to
have
been
so
there
was
a
feeling
of
loneliness
in
it
all
of
the
loneliness
it
was
quite
a
woman
sensation
she
would
rather
have
had
all
she
saw
another
and
herself
too
yet
it
was
by
no
means
that
craving
after
marriage
which
some
women
feel
for
she
certainly
had
not
been
without
many
an
opportunity
of
gratifying
it
had
she
been
so
inclined
but
she
wished
that
all
she
saw
had
been
a
still
a
mother
anybody
but
her
own
and
that
she
had
not
been
a
solitary
being
on
the
earth
with
so
much
wealth
such
great
responsibilities
and
so
little
kindred
sympathy
her
thoughts
were
of
her
father
and
her
mother
of
the
companions
and
friends
of
her
childhood
and
of
every
one
who
had
shared
those
happy
hours
which
like
the
flowers
of
spring
are
far
more
beautiful
than
the
fruits
of
summer
and
in
the
scenes
where
she
had
known
so
much
happiness
the
very
memory
of
those
whom
she
had
loved
seemed
dearer
to
her
than
the
presence
of
any
whom
she
still
knew
she
felt
that
her
mood
was
not
for
the
wider
scene
and
she
turned
back
into
the
narrower
paths
the
green
soft
shades
of
which
suited
better
with
the
humour
of
the
moment
she
had
gone
on
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
still
buried
in
thought
when
she
heard
a
step
and
looked
up
the
path
wound
a
good
deal
in
its
course
so
that
seeing
no
one
upon
it
and
being
within
ten
or
twelve
yards
of
the
lane
she
fancied
that
the
footfall
must
have
been
upon
the
road
the
next
instant
however
just
at
the
turn
within
a
few
feet
of
her
she
beheld
a
stranger
maria
was
not
by
nature
cowardly
nor
what
is
vulgarly
called
nervous
she
had
no
bad
habit
of
screaming
at
trifles
or
jumping
at
the
banging
of
a
door
but
she
certainly
did
start
at
this
sudden
apparition
and
for
a
moment
hesitated
whether
she
should
go
on
or
turn
back
an
instant
consideration
however
was
sufficient
to
make
her
resolve
to
follow
the
former
course
it
is
ridiculous
to
be
frightened
she
thought
remembering
that
there
were
a
stile
and
one
or
two
gates
into
the
lane
he
has
probably
come
to
see
the
steward
or
some
of
the
people
at
the
house
and
after
a
just
perceptible
pause
she
walked
on
merely
glancing
her
eye
over
the
stranger
form
as
she
did
so
that
glance
showed
her
nothing
to
be
frightened
at
for
there
is
certainly
something
in
air
and
mien
and
general
appearance
which
although
devils
will
take
angels
forms
at
times
has
a
powerful
effect
upon
that
very
unreasonable
thing
human
reason
briefly
as
her
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
person
before
her
they
had
no
time
to
scan
him
very
accurately
but
still
she
saw
at
once
three
very
important
facts
that
he
was
very
well
dressed
that
he
had
the
bearing
and
look
of
a
gentleman
and
that
he
was
a
remarkably
handsome
man
though
very
dark
in
the
mean
time
what
was
the
stranger
about
he
too
had
suddenly
paused
and
he
looked
for
a
moment
irresolute
the
next
instant
however
he
advanced
straight
towards
the
beautiful
girl
before
him
and
raising
his
hat
with
a
graceful
inclination
of
the
head
he
said
i
fear
i
am
trespassing
may
i
ask
if
these
are
the
grounds
of
the
earl
of
milford
all
maria
little
tremor
was
at
an
end
and
she
looked
up
frankly
replying
no
these
are
mine
harley
lodge
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
but
and
she
stopped
and
hesitated
not
knowing
whether
to
tell
the
stranger
abruptly
of
lord
milford
death
or
not
you
were
going
to
add
something
said
the
stranger
after
having
waited
a
moment
for
the
conclusion
of
the
sentence
i
was
merely
about
to
ask
who
it
is
you
wish
to
see
replied
maria
for
i
fear
you
will
find
nobody
there
but
servants
and
she
blushed
a
little
as
she
spoke
it
said
the
gentleman
a
carrier
i
met
just
now
told
me
that
on
this
side
was
harley
lodge
and
that
the
opposite
property
belonged
to
miss
monkton
he
was
mistaken
i
assure
you
answered
maria
with
a
smile
at
the
doubt
he
seemed
to
entertain
i
am
miss
monkton
this
is
bolton
park
i
did
not
doubt
you
of
course
said
the
stranger
the
man
was
very
stupid
so
to
mislead
me
but
to
answer
your
question
it
was
the
earl
i
wished
to
see
and
if
not
himself
lady
milford
or
lady
anne
maria
brow
grew
dark
it
is
long
i
imagine
she
said
raising
her
eyes
to
the
very
handsome
face
it
is
long
i
imagine
since
you
have
seen
any
of
the
family
sir
and
many
sad
changes
take
place
in
a
few
years
the
stranger
started
evidently
alarmed
the
earl
he
asked
is
the
earl
i
am
sorry
to
pain
you
said
maria
much
struck
by
the
agitation
he
displayed
but
he
has
been
dead
some
years
and
lady
milford
also
how
they
go
out
said
the
stranger
with
a
deep
sigh
how
they
go
out
what
go
out
asked
maria
in
some
surprise
hopes
said
the
other
in
a
tone
of
such
deep
melancholy
that
she
felt
there
must
be
some
very
painful
feelings
awakened
by
the
words
she
had
spoken
and
she
gazed
at
her
companion
face
attentively
as
he
remained
with
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
ground
a
sudden
fit
of
trembling
seized
her
but
the
next
moment
he
looked
up
and
their
eyes
met
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
monkton
he
said
i
will
not
detain
you
longer
if
you
will
merely
tell
me
which
is
my
best
way
to
reach
harley
lodge
for
i
must
go
up
to
the
house
at
all
events
i
will
show
you
if
you
come
with
me
said
maria
in
an
agitated
tone
but
there
is
no
one
there
lady
anne
is
in
london
i
should
like
to
go
at
all
events
said
the
other
turning
to
walk
on
by
her
side
i
suppose
you
were
well
acquainted
with
the
late
earl
said
maria
after
a
pause
and
i
am
afraid
the
news
i
have
had
to
give
you
is
very
painful
i
knew
him
well
replied
the
stranger
and
have
met
with
many
acts
of
kindness
at
his
hands
i
should
be
most
ungrateful
were
i
not
deeply
grieved
at
hearing
of
his
death
but
let
me
speak
of
a
pleasanter
subject
miss
monkton
in
a
few
days
i
shall
have
the
honour
of
claiming
your
acquaintance
upon
a
better
foundation
than
at
present
at
least
if
i
am
not
mistaken
he
added
hurriedly
in
supposing
you
the
daughter
of
the
late
sir
edward
monkton
i
have
a
letter
for
you
from
my
friend
charles
marston
and
one
also
for
lady
fleetwood
am
i
right
oh
yes
replied
maria
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
hear
from
my
cousin
it
is
seldom
he
does
any
one
the
favour
of
writing
have
you
seen
him
lately
about
six
months
ago
answered
her
companion
but
i
must
explain
the
cause
of
my
long
delay
in
delivering
his
letters
i
then
intended
to
visit
england
directly
but
other
affairs
intervened
which
called
me
back
to
spain
and
i
only
arrived
in
this
country
the
day
before
yesterday
have
you
resided
long
in
spain
asked
maria
very
many
years
was
the
reply
ever
since
i
came
from
mexico
when
i
was
a
mere
boy
maria
looked
down
upon
the
path
and
fell
into
deep
thought
while
the
stranger
went
on
to
say
i
have
travelled
in
other
countries
it
is
true
but
spain
i
look
upon
almost
as
my
native
land
she
made
no
answer
but
still
walked
with
her
eyes
bent
down
and
the
stranger
gazed
at
her
unobserved
with
evident
admiration
and
well
indeed
he
might
for
in
whatever
lands
he
had
rambled
he
could
not
have
seen
anything
more
lovely
after
a
brief
pause
however
as
she
still
remained
silent
he
said
i
have
marston
letter
in
my
and
may
as
well
deliver
it
at
once
to
prove
to
you
that
your
kind
courtesy
miss
monkton
is
shown
to
a
gentleman
oh
i
do
not
doubt
it
in
the
least
replied
maria
looking
up
brightly
and
then
she
added
in
a
very
marked
tone
i
never
doubt
i
never
have
doubted
or
suspected
in
my
life
the
stranger
looked
full
into
her
eyes
and
then
he
in
turn
fell
into
a
fit
of
thought
an
instant
after
he
roused
himself
with
a
start
and
taking
out
his
produced
the
letter
he
had
mentioned
maria
took
it
and
read
merely
the
address
miss
monkton
by
the
hands
of
colonel
francis
middleton
i
will
read
his
epistle
colonel
middleton
said
maria
stumbling
a
little
at
the
name
have
you
known
my
cousin
charles
long
yes
he
answered
at
once
and
then
correcting
himself
added
that
is
to
say
eighteen
months
or
more
but
there
are
some
men
easily
known
and
marston
is
so
frank
and
open
that
we
became
intimate
from
a
very
early
period
of
our
acquaintance
i
wonder
said
maria
that
he
did
not
tell
you
the
history
of
your
friends
here
which
would
have
spared
me
the
pain
of
giving
you
evil
tidings
there
was
again
something
peculiar
in
her
tone
and
her
cheek
grew
somewhat
red
showing
more
distinctly
a
scar
across
his
cheek
which
was
visible
but
that
was
all
while
his
face
retained
its
ordinary
dark
brown
hue
it
did
not
occur
to
me
to
ask
him
he
replied
with
some
degree
of
embarrassment
and
both
he
and
maria
fell
into
silence
again
for
a
few
minutes
at
length
maria
asked
do
you
intend
to
visit
london
soon
i
return
to
town
and
i
am
sure
lady
fleetwood
will
be
most
happy
to
see
you
i
go
replied
frank
middleton
and
maria
fell
into
a
reverie
once
more
a
minute
or
two
after
they
reached
a
little
at
the
top
of
the
bank
overhanging
the
fence
beside
it
was
a
small
gate
in
the
park
paling
with
stone
steps
descending
to
the
road
and
maria
laid
her
hand
upon
the
latch
but
paused
ere
she
raised
it
as
if
irresolute
the
next
moment
however
she
opened
the
gate
and
pointed
up
the
road
saying
about
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
you
will
find
a
stile
which
will
lead
you
by
a
little
path
straight
to
harley
lodge
you
can
not
mistake
the
way
her
companion
gazed
at
her
earnestly
while
she
spoke
and
for
a
moment
or
two
after
and
then
thanking
her
for
her
kindness
and
apologizing
for
his
intrusion
in
words
of
course
but
with
tones
that
spoke
much
more
passed
out
of
the
gate
drew
it
after
him
gave
her
one
more
look
as
if
he
would
fain
have
impressed
her
features
on
his
mind
for
ever
and
descended
the
steps
maria
stood
like
marble
where
he
had
left
her
and
her
cheek
had
become
like
marble
too
she
trembled
and
her
eye
was
strained
eagerly
but
sightless
upon
the
ground
she
raised
her
hand
to
her
head
as
if
to
still
the
agitated
thoughts
within
and
then
the
next
instant
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
the
gate
and
threw
it
open
exclaiming
henry
henry
the
other
turned
gazed
at
her
sprang
up
the
steps
and
taking
both
her
hands
in
his
replied
by
the
one
word
maria
oh
henry
sobbed
maria
monkton
overcome
by
agitation
i
must
speak
to
you
i
must
talk
to
you
before
before
you
act
so
rashly
for
your
own
sake
for
heaven
sake
think
of
what
you
are
doing
angel
said
her
companion
gazing
at
her
with
deep
tenderness
and
do
you
still
remember
me
do
you
still
take
an
interest
in
me
in
me
the
outcast
the
exile
the
friendless
the
forlorn
in
me
whom
you
must
whom
you
do
believe
criminal
no
henry
no
exclaimed
maria
a
generous
glow
spreading
over
her
face
i
do
not
believe
you
criminal
i
never
did
neither
did
my
dear
mother
we
knew
you
better
i
am
sure
you
are
as
innocent
as
i
am
thank
god
for
that
said
henry
hayley
there
were
then
some
who
did
me
justice
and
they
the
noblest
and
the
best
oh
maria
the
most
painful
part
of
a
terrible
situation
has
been
to
think
that
those
whom
i
loved
and
esteemed
the
most
would
cast
me
from
their
affection
and
look
upon
me
as
criminal
and
dishonoured
oh
no
cried
maria
few
did
of
those
who
knew
you
but
i
must
do
an
imprudent
thing
henry
and
ask
you
to
go
back
to
the
house
for
i
am
too
much
agitated
to
talk
to
you
calmly
here
and
yet
indeed
i
must
reason
with
you
as
to
what
you
are
going
to
do
henry
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
but
he
accompanied
her
without
reply
for
it
was
an
invitation
that
he
would
not
refuse
and
yet
he
knew
that
her
arguments
in
regard
to
his
future
conduct
would
be
in
vain
for
he
had
made
up
his
mind
and
was
not
one
likely
to
change
through
the
fair
scenery
amidst
which
they
had
so
often
walked
and
played
in
childhood
those
two
took
their
way
some
object
at
every
step
awakening
memories
of
the
hours
when
they
were
the
happiest
and
more
than
once
maria
looked
up
to
her
companion
face
and
asked
do
you
remember
this
or
do
you
remember
that
and
he
ever
did
remember
right
well
and
added
some
incident
which
showed
how
clearly
the
whole
was
in
his
recollection
oh
it
is
very
pleasant
when
two
old
and
dear
friends
long
parted
are
reunited
to
talk
over
old
times
and
scenes
and
let
butterfly
memory
flit
from
flower
to
flower
in
the
past
but
doubly
sweet
when
the
recollections
are
those
of
happy
childhood
without
a
stain
upon
their
white
garments
which
regret
might
vainly
wish
to
clear
away
soothing
and
cheering
are
such
themes
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
house
maria
felt
that
she
could
talk
to
her
companion
of
almost
anything
without
fearing
that
agitation
which
had
made
her
seek
the
shelter
of
her
own
dwelling
nevertheless
she
thought
it
better
to
follow
her
first
plan
and
though
the
door
was
not
locked
she
rang
the
bell
and
led
the
way
for
her
visiter
into
the
library
the
first
object
which
struck
his
sight
was
a
large
picture
of
lady
monkton
and
walking
up
to
it
he
gazed
at
it
earnestly
for
a
minute
or
two
when
he
turned
round
there
was
a
tear
in
his
fine
dark
eye
and
taking
maria
hand
he
kissed
it
saying
she
was
ever
kind
to
me
and
to
all
henry
said
maria
her
own
eyes
running
over
but
to
me
especially
he
replied
she
loved
you
very
much
answered
maria
with
a
sigh
but
now
tell
me
she
continued
seating
herself
what
you
are
going
to
do
for
indeed
i
feel
so
terrified
at
seeing
you
in
this
country
that
i
could
not
let
you
go
away
without
expressing
my
fears
for
your
safety
at
first
i
felt
so
bewildered
at
finding
one
living
whom
i
had
long
believed
dead
that
i
did
not
know
how
to
act
i
do
not
think
any
one
but
you
will
recognise
me
said
henry
hayley
how
you
came
to
do
so
i
can
not
conceive
for
your
cousin
charles
has
associated
with
me
for
months
without
showing
the
slightest
remembrance
of
me
that
is
strange
replied
maria
he
was
your
schoolfellow
and
friend
too
it
is
true
yet
i
was
much
more
frequently
here
or
at
the
lodge
than
with
him
said
her
companion
we
were
in
different
forms
at
school
and
moreover
i
believe
women
eyes
are
quicker
and
their
memory
of
friends
better
than
men
would
you
not
have
remembered
me
asked
maria
a
little
unfairly
perhaps
anywhere
instantly
replied
henry
eagerly
but
you
are
very
little
changed
comparatively
this
gash
upon
my
cheek
those
large
whiskers
and
this
tanned
skin
i
thought
would
have
concealed
me
fully
maria
shook
her
head
and
he
went
on
to
ask
if
she
had
recognised
him
directly
no
she
answered
but
very
soon
your
height
and
figure
being
so
much
changed
together
with
the
other
circumstances
you
have
mentioned
as
well
as
the
conviction
that
you
had
been
long
dead
blinded
me
at
first
but
after
a
few
words
you
looked
at
me
as
you
sometimes
used
to
do
when
we
were
boy
and
girl
and
then
a
sudden
feeling
for
i
can
not
call
it
anything
else
came
over
me
that
it
must
be
henry
for
a
little
time
i
dared
not
look
at
you
again
but
when
i
told
you
of
lord
milford
death
and
you
stood
gazing
on
the
ground
with
the
eyelids
drooping
over
the
eyes
i
became
quite
sure
and
trembled
so
that
i
could
hardly
support
myself
they
were
pleasant
words
to
the
ear
of
henry
hayley
they
were
indeed
very
sweet
to
any
man
and
under
almost
any
circumstances
they
might
well
be
so
for
the
deep
interest
of
a
beautiful
and
amiable
being
like
that
could
surely
never
be
a
matter
of
indifference
and
such
emotions
as
those
words
betrayed
could
not
exist
without
a
deep
interest
but
in
henry
they
excited
very
peculiar
feelings
in
long
homeless
wanderings
in
strange
turns
of
fate
and
struggles
with
the
world
in
sorrows
and
reverses
in
prosperity
and
distress
he
had
still
asked
himself
do
those
loved
so
dearly
still
remember
me
with
affection
or
do
they
hate
and
contemn
me
or
have
they
forgotten
me
as
amongst
the
dead
amongst
those
he
thought
of
when
he
put
such
questions
to
his
own
heart
certainly
maria
monkton
had
ever
been
prominent
as
i
have
shown
when
he
fled
from
england
though
not
yet
sixteen
he
was
much
more
manly
in
thought
and
feeling
than
most
boys
of
his
age
he
had
loved
maria
almost
as
a
brother
might
love
he
had
thought
her
the
most
beautiful
as
well
as
the
most
amiable
of
creatures
it
is
true
and
perhaps
he
might
have
gone
on
only
loving
her
with
brotherly
love
if
he
had
never
been
separated
from
her
when
however
in
after
years
he
had
suffered
his
mind
to
rest
upon
the
past
when
he
had
asked
himself
does
maria
remember
me
still
and
when
he
had
wondered
what
she
was
like
then
there
had
mingled
with
such
thoughts
tenderer
and
more
imaginative
feelings
he
had
thought
perhaps
if
i
had
remained
and
all
gone
well
maria
might
have
become
my
wife
and
then
the
beautiful
eyes
that
he
remembered
and
the
sweet
smile
and
the
many
affectionate
looks
of
the
past
would
return
to
the
sight
almost
as
distinct
and
clear
as
if
her
face
were
still
before
him
he
knew
not
when
to
save
a
father
he
abandoned
his
country
and
encountered
danger
sorrow
and
despair
how
much
he
really
loved
the
girl
who
now
sat
beside
him
again
but
he
had
discovered
it
afterwards
and
now
how
sweet
how
very
sweet
it
was
to
find
that
her
bosom
could
thrill
with
such
emotions
on
his
account
he
gazed
on
her
face
while
she
spoke
but
when
she
paused
he
bent
down
his
eyes
again
and
let
the
mind
plunge
into
a
sea
of
memories
maria
suffered
him
to
think
for
a
few
minutes
believing
that
his
mind
was
busy
with
the
circumstances
of
his
present
situation
and
future
fate
she
had
none
of
that
grasping
vanity
which
makes
many
a
woman
believe
that
each
male
companion
must
be
thinking
only
of
her
she
had
never
asked
herself
one
question
as
to
what
might
have
been
henry
feelings
to
her
or
hers
to
him
had
he
remained
in
england
she
had
only
thought
of
him
during
his
long
absence
as
the
dear
companion
of
her
childhood
and
her
early
youth
as
one
excellent
amiable
and
noble
who
by
some
strange
mysterious
fate
which
she
did
not
try
to
scan
had
been
destined
to
sorrow
undeserved
disgrace
and
early
death
a
whole
crowd
of
tender
regrets
it
is
true
had
gathered
round
his
memory
like
flowers
showered
upon
a
tomb
and
it
is
likewise
true
that
the
character
of
henry
hayley
as
she
had
conceived
it
and
decorated
it
with
her
own
fancies
had
served
her
as
a
touchstone
to
try
that
of
other
men
but
still
she
never
fancied
that
she
had
loved
him
otherwise
than
merely
as
a
brother
she
let
him
think
then
for
a
short
time
but
at
length
she
said
well
henry
what
do
you
intend
to
do
is
not
your
presence
in
this
country
dangerous
to
you
for
you
must
now
see
that
many
may
recognise
you
none
but
you
said
henry
no
none
but
you
oh
yes
indeed
replied
his
companion
there
is
at
least
one
who
will
do
so
i
am
sure
i
mean
lady
anne
we
have
often
talked
of
you
together
and
i
am
quite
sure
she
will
at
once
remember
you
perhaps
indeed
you
intended
to
tell
her
as
you
were
going
to
her
house
no
certainly
not
answered
henry
there
were
only
two
to
whom
i
proposed
to
acknowledge
my
own
name
unless
i
acknowledged
it
at
once
to
all
the
world
her
father
and
yourself
to
her
father
because
as
the
kindest
friend
i
ever
had
i
intended
to
ask
and
follow
his
advice
as
to
my
conduct
to
you
maria
because
i
would
not
have
quitted
england
again
without
telling
you
how
i
have
thought
of
you
how
i
have
remembered
you
how
i
have
blessed
you
for
all
the
kindness
you
once
showed
me
for
all
the
happiness
you
poured
upon
my
happiest
days
maria
cheek
turned
somewhat
pale
and
after
pausing
for
a
moment
henry
went
on
saying
lady
anne
mellent
will
not
remember
me
depend
upon
it
maria
shook
her
head
you
are
mistaken
she
said
i
am
quite
sure
she
will
she
has
your
portrait
and
it
is
still
very
like
my
portrait
exclaimed
henry
hayley
impossible
dear
maria
i
only
sat
for
my
portrait
once
and
that
was
to
saunders
for
a
miniature
for
my
poor
father
she
has
it
at
all
events
replied
maria
with
something
like
a
sigh
perhaps
she
bought
it
at
poor
hayley
sale
that
is
very
odd
said
henry
under
such
circumstances
i
had
better
not
call
at
all
yet
even
if
she
did
recognise
me
it
could
do
no
harm
no
one
now
living
dear
maria
knows
who
i
really
am
but
yourself
no
one
can
prove
it
but
you
to
whom
i
have
acknowledged
the
fact
and
with
you
he
added
laying
his
hand
gently
upon
hers
i
know
i
am
as
safe
as
if
the
secret
still
rested
in
my
own
breast
people
might
suspect
people
might
feel
sure
but
yet
no
one
i
repeat
could
prove
that
i
am
any
but
frank
middleton
an
officer
in
the
service
of
spain
and
i
can
prove
that
i
am
what
i
am
not
beyond
all
possibility
of
refutation
the
son
of
an
english
gentleman
and
a
spanish
lady
brought
up
in
italy
and
serving
long
in
the
spanish
army
maria
looked
bewildered
this
is
very
strange
she
said
i
do
not
comprehend
it
every
one
here
certainly
thinks
you
dead
and
indeed
i
now
remember
the
officer
saw
you
lying
apparently
a
corpse
and
a
certificate
of
your
death
was
sent
over
by
the
consul
i
do
not
wish
henry
to
inquire
into
anything
that
you
may
wish
to
conceal
but
still
still
i
can
have
nothing
to
conceal
from
you
he
answered
the
strange
part
of
my
history
is
very
soon
told
and
explained
first
as
to
my
innocence
maria
a
few
words
will
clear
that
up
at
once
and
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
sad
tone
my
father
forged
your
name
in
a
moment
i
believe
i
trust
of
madness
he
sent
me
to
get
the
money
for
the
draft
without
my
knowing
anything
of
the
deed
he
then
despatched
me
on
a
long
journey
to
seek
the
means
of
paying
the
sum
he
had
so
wrongfully
obtained
before
the
draft
came
due
furnishing
me
with
several
of
the
notes
which
had
been
given
him
for
the
draft
and
which
were
doubtless
used
to
prove
my
guilt
on
my
return
from
the
north
he
told
me
all
and
left
me
the
choice
of
seeing
him
executed
as
a
felon
or
flying
from
the
country
and
bearing
the
load
of
suspicion
myself
i
hastened
on
to
ancona
but
having
caught
a
fever
by
the
way
i
was
carried
almost
insensible
not
to
the
hospital
but
to
the
franciscan
monastery
in
the
town
there
were
several
irish
monks
in
the
brotherhood
and
one
of
them
nursed
me
with
the
utmost
tenderness
i
told
him
all
under
a
solemn
promise
of
secresy
and
proved
to
him
my
innocence
when
the
officer
arrived
in
search
of
me
i
was
rapidly
recovering
but
in
the
same
monastery
was
the
son
of
a
spanish
lady
the
wife
of
a
middleton
who
had
separated
from
her
husband
and
who
fearing
on
her
deathbed
that
her
son
would
be
brought
up
as
a
protestant
had
placed
him
in
concealment
with
the
monks
he
had
caught
the
same
fever
for
it
was
then
raging
in
that
part
of
italy
and
on
the
very
night
the
officer
first
applied
at
the
gates
in
order
to
have
me
delivered
up
the
poor
boy
died
the
monks
consulted
together
and
agreed
to
shelter
me
against
pursuit
in
the
hope
i
believe
of
ultimately
converting
me
they
removed
me
from
the
cell
where
i
had
been
placed
carried
the
dead
body
of
the
poor
lad
thither
and
passed
it
for
mine
both
upon
the
officer
and
the
consul
thus
i
escaped
pursuit
and
in
the
cemetery
at
ancona
stands
a
little
tomb
inscribed
with
the
name
of
hayley
ah
but
tell
me
more
henry
exclaimed
maria
what
became
of
you
then
does
it
interest
you
he
asked
with
a
sad
smile
well
then
i
will
sketch
out
all
i
remained
in
that
monastery
three
months
longer
the
good
monks
instructing
me
diligently
in
the
roman
catholic
faith
maria
countenance
fell
but
henry
went
on
at
length
there
came
a
letter
from
the
uncle
of
middleton
in
spain
demanding
his
niece
child
should
be
sent
to
him
with
a
promise
that
he
would
provide
for
it
the
monks
accordingly
sent
me
with
instructions
to
personate
the
poor
boy
but
i
had
resolved
what
to
do
for
although
their
ideas
did
not
permit
them
to
see
any
evil
in
the
deceit
which
they
said
would
confer
much
happiness
on
the
uncle
as
well
as
ensure
my
own
safety
yet
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
benefit
by
a
cheat
the
old
man
received
me
most
kindly
but
was
surprised
to
find
how
little
spanish
i
knew
for
i
had
only
learned
the
mere
rudiments
in
the
convent
and
as
he
could
speak
no
other
tongue
i
was
obliged
to
wait
for
more
than
six
months
ere
i
could
tell
him
the
whole
as
i
had
resolved
to
do
during
that
time
he
conceived
the
greatest
affection
for
me
sent
me
to
a
college
treated
me
as
his
heir
and
lavished
every
sort
of
kindness
upon
me
it
was
all
terribly
painful
but
at
length
finding
myself
sufficiently
master
of
the
language
to
tell
my
tale
i
took
an
opportunity
when
he
was
alone
brought
him
every
present
he
had
made
me
money
jewels
trinkets
all
and
then
informed
him
of
the
facts
he
was
struck
and
very
much
affected
and
for
some
minutes
seemed
not
to
know
how
to
act
but
at
length
he
threw
his
arms
round
me
and
said
boy
you
shall
not
suffer
for
your
honesty
say
not
a
word
of
this
to
any
one
and
be
still
to
me
a
son
and
did
you
become
a
roman
catholic
asked
maria
somewhat
sadly
henry
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
with
a
look
which
she
found
difficult
to
interpret
there
was
something
almost
reproachful
in
the
expression
and
yet
something
joyful
too
it
might
perhaps
have
been
interpreted
do
you
doubt
me
and
yet
your
very
doubt
shows
that
you
do
take
a
deep
interest
in
my
fate
no
maria
no
he
answered
had
i
done
so
i
might
have
been
now
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
spain
almost
the
first
question
asked
me
was
regarding
my
faith
you
are
not
perhaps
aware
that
no
very
strict
religious
notions
of
any
kind
had
prevailed
in
my
poor
father
house
and
i
had
obtained
but
little
religious
instruction
there
neither
was
my
new
my
adopted
father
a
bigot
but
still
he
was
a
roman
catholic
and
when
i
told
him
that
i
had
been
brought
up
as
a
protestant
he
like
the
good
monks
insisted
that
i
should
receive
instruction
in
his
own
faith
of
course
to
that
i
could
not
object
but
the
instruction
was
interrupted
he
was
obliged
to
go
to
mexico
and
took
me
with
him
but
i
had
learned
to
inquire
for
myself
and
my
inquiries
left
no
doubt
i
had
at
first
a
difficulty
in
obtaining
books
on
any
side
but
one
but
at
lima
whither
we
afterwards
went
i
found
several
englishmen
from
whom
i
got
all
that
was
needful
i
took
the
bible
and
common
sense
and
i
could
not
be
a
papist
south
america
was
at
that
time
in
a
state
of
great
confusion
and
we
returned
to
spain
when
i
was
about
eighteen
years
old
or
a
little
more
my
adopted
father
reached
his
native
land
but
with
shattered
health
and
a
few
months
after
he
felt
that
he
was
dying
at
that
last
solemn
moment
he
required
me
to
tell
him
whether
in
sincerity
and
truth
i
could
now
embrace
and
keep
the
roman
catholic
faith
i
answered
him
sincerely
and
though
grieved
he
was
not
offended
he
pointed
out
to
me
however
that
he
could
not
leave
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
to
a
heretic
in
fact
that
his
doing
so
might
prove
dangerous
to
myself
by
calling
attention
to
facts
regarding
my
opinions
which
had
hitherto
passed
unnoticed
he
made
his
will
the
same
night
great
wealth
thereby
passed
to
very
distant
relations
who
had
every
right
to
it
and
a
more
humble
but
still
an
ample
share
of
his
fortune
came
to
me
why
he
did
not
explain
but
probably
in
order
to
gain
me
good
repute
amongst
the
ecclesiastics
of
his
own
church
he
left
several
large
sums
to
be
distributed
by
me
to
religious
establishments
in
madrid
and
toledo
and
as
i
took
care
to
comply
with
his
instructions
in
a
liberal
spirit
after
his
death
no
inquiries
were
made
at
the
time
as
to
my
religious
views
nor
any
observations
upon
my
neglect
of
the
forms
of
the
romish
religion
i
had
entered
the
spanish
army
before
my
kind
friend
death
and
ever
since
have
been
actively
employed
till
political
changes
and
some
rumours
respecting
my
creed
which
might
have
become
dangerous
induced
me
to
go
to
italy
where
my
first
visit
was
to
the
monks
of
ancona
i
found
that
the
good
brother
john
who
had
been
so
kind
to
me
was
dead
but
he
had
left
with
another
of
my
countrymen
in
the
monastery
the
papers
necessary
to
prove
my
real
name
and
birth
should
it
be
necessary
i
have
them
safe
but
there
is
no
copy
of
them
and
thus
there
is
no
one
living
but
yourself
who
can
prove
that
frank
middleton
is
henry
hayley
i
suppose
that
my
fears
proceed
from
inexperience
said
maria
thoughtfully
but
yet
i
can
not
feel
so
well
assured
as
you
seem
to
be
henry
and
oh
how
i
wish
that
you
could
boldly
proclaim
and
clearly
prove
your
innocence
and
take
once
more
your
place
amongst
us
all
free
from
even
a
suspicion
i
have
had
thoughts
of
attempting
it
he
replied
and
upon
that
very
subject
it
was
that
i
intended
to
consult
the
earl
of
milford
my
poor
father
before
i
went
furnished
me
with
a
paper
in
case
i
should
be
captured
which
he
believed
would
be
sufficient
to
exculpate
me
fully
but
i
have
looked
at
it
often
since
and
doubt
that
it
would
have
the
effect
he
therein
takes
the
guilt
upon
himself
and
solemnly
declares
that
i
was
perfectly
ignorant
of
the
whole
transaction
but
the
paper
wants
form
and
drawn
up
at
a
moment
of
terrible
agitation
the
handwriting
has
little
resemblance
to
his
usual
clear
and
hand
will
you
be
my
adviser
maria
as
i
can
not
obtain
counsel
of
the
earl
willingly
willingly
would
i
she
replied
if
i
had
judgment
and
knowledge
enough
to
render
my
advice
worth
having
but
i
shall
see
you
again
soon
in
london
i
suppose
there
we
may
have
no
sweet
private
moments
such
as
we
have
here
he
answered
with
a
voice
shaken
by
some
strong
emotions
in
the
record
of
ten
long
years
i
have
much
very
much
to
tell
to
the
only
one
in
all
the
world
to
whom
the
thoughts
and
feelings
and
actions
ay
and
fancies
and
dreams
of
all
that
period
can
be
told
oh
maria
you
can
form
no
idea
of
what
has
been
the
solitude
of
my
heart
during
those
long
long
ten
years
i
have
mingled
with
the
world
i
have
taken
an
active
part
therein
i
have
associated
with
many
had
acquaintances
and
friends
such
as
the
world
gives
but
in
my
own
breast
i
have
been
lonely
with
all
around
me
there
has
been
no
one
link
of
sweet
association
no
memory
in
common
no
interchange
of
early
sympathy
i
could
never
refer
to
the
sweet
hours
gone
by
i
could
never
talk
of
those
i
had
loved
it
was
as
if
i
were
a
creature
of
two
existences
one
for
the
world
in
which
i
moved
active
eager
bustling
full
of
enterprise
and
danger
and
adventure
but
cold
hard
inanimate
the
other
for
myself
alone
still
silent
motionless
confined
to
my
own
bosom
but
full
of
memories
and
visions
kindly
sympathies
aspirations
hopes
loves
all
still
living
but
entombed
maria
was
very
pale
and
her
bright
eyes
were
cast
down
but
over
her
cheek
as
he
ended
a
drop
like
a
diamond
rolled
slowly
she
would
not
wipe
it
away
she
hoped
he
did
not
see
it
but
he
did
and
it
was
hard
to
restrain
himself
from
kissing
it
off
that
fair
cheek
hark
cried
maria
starting
up
there
is
a
carriage
coming
who
can
it
be
compose
yourself
dear
girl
he
answered
be
calm
maria
be
calm
remember
i
have
brought
you
a
letter
from
your
cousin
and
oh
maria
remember
also
that
you
have
given
me
an
hour
of
the
purest
happiness
my
chequered
life
has
ever
known
let
that
tranquillize
the
sad
feelings
which
the
sight
of
henry
hayley
has
awakened
ah
but
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
they
are
not
all
sad
henry
he
pressed
his
lips
upon
the
hand
she
gave
and
then
she
hurriedly
opened
charles
marston
letter
and
wiped
the
tear
from
her
cheek
the
next
moment
the
door
was
opened
and
lady
anne
mellent
announced
chapter
x
time
the
great
had
done
much
in
his
own
particular
way
with
lady
anne
mellent
during
the
last
ten
years
when
henry
hayley
had
quitted
england
she
was
a
gay
decided
clever
little
girl
somewhat
spoiled
by
her
mother
but
more
reasonably
treated
by
her
father
for
whom
she
had
a
deep
and
devoted
affection
and
much
respect
she
had
then
been
very
small
for
her
age
and
being
a
year
or
more
younger
than
maria
monkton
had
looked
at
least
four
or
five
years
her
junior
for
maria
at
thirteen
had
been
not
much
less
in
height
than
she
was
at
two
or
lady
anne
indeed
had
not
at
that
time
taken
her
start
everything
has
its
start
in
the
world
and
very
few
things
go
on
with
quiet
progression
but
especially
in
boys
and
girls
there
is
generally
a
period
at
which
they
make
a
great
and
sudden
rush
towards
manhood
or
womanhood
and
that
period
is
often
preceded
by
one
of
great
inactivity
of
development
much
greater
then
was
the
difference
in
henry
eyes
between
the
lady
anne
of
the
present
and
the
past
than
between
the
maria
of
the
present
and
the
past
and
when
the
former
entered
as
he
sat
beside
miss
monkton
he
was
surprised
to
find
so
little
that
had
any
hold
of
memory
in
the
young
and
graceful
woman
who
appeared
lady
anne
mellent
was
not
very
tall
indeed
but
still
she
was
somewhat
above
the
middle
height
of
woman
she
might
be
five
feet
four
or
perhaps
a
little
more
but
formed
with
great
delicacy
small
in
the
bones
and
slight
rather
than
thin
she
seemed
less
in
height
than
she
really
was
nevertheless
her
figure
was
of
course
greatly
changed
since
henry
had
last
seen
her
the
child
had
become
a
woman
and
the
features
then
round
and
barely
developed
were
greatly
altered
for
though
still
delicate
and
beautiful
they
were
now
clearly
defined
and
chiselled
her
dress
was
somewhat
peculiar
for
over
the
ordinary
morning
habit
of
the
time
she
wore
a
light
silk
tunic
bordered
with
rich
and
beautiful
fur
and
on
her
head
instead
of
a
bonnet
was
a
sort
of
polish
cap
trimmed
with
the
same
skin
on
her
hands
were
thick
doeskin
gloves
or
gauntlets
with
flaps
almost
to
her
elbows
and
her
tiny
foot
was
lost
in
a
furred
shoe
ushered
in
at
once
she
paused
the
moment
after
she
had
crossed
the
threshold
in
surprise
at
the
sight
of
a
gentleman
seated
with
her
fair
friend
but
the
next
moment
she
advanced
to
maria
and
kissed
her
with
sisterly
affection
maria
was
somewhat
embarrassed
and
the
trace
of
tears
was
still
upon
her
cheek
but
she
gracefully
introduced
colonel
middleton
to
her
fair
visiter
and
lady
anne
turning
towards
him
surveyed
him
with
a
rapid
glance
from
head
to
heel
bowing
her
head
as
she
did
so
and
merely
saying
oh
there
was
something
rather
in
the
tone
which
did
not
altogether
please
henry
and
served
further
to
embarrass
maria
whose
bosom
was
too
full
of
emotions
to
suffer
her
to
exert
that
command
over
her
demeanour
which
she
usually
possessed
and
in
order
to
carry
off
the
appearance
of
agitation
and
to
account
for
the
presence
of
a
stranger
she
proceeded
to
explain
to
lady
anne
that
colonel
middleton
had
brought
her
a
letter
from
her
cousin
charles
and
none
for
me
exclaimed
the
fair
lady
in
a
gay
and
jesting
tone
on
my
word
that
is
too
bad
but
charles
marston
and
i
are
certainly
the
two
rudest
people
in
the
world
do
you
not
think
so
colonel
middleton
now
that
you
know
us
both
no
indeed
replied
henry
i
do
not
think
the
term
applicable
in
either
case
marston
is
certainly
not
a
man
of
ceremonies
and
i
have
not
yet
oh
fine
speeches
fine
speeches
exclaimed
lady
anne
when
will
men
have
done
with
fine
speeches
but
to
fix
you
to
the
point
first
do
you
not
think
when
a
gentleman
has
promised
to
a
lady
to
write
to
her
every
month
giving
her
the
whole
account
of
his
travels
and
does
not
write
that
it
is
very
rude
well
charles
marston
promised
me
to
do
so
when
we
parted
in
rome
and
i
have
not
heard
a
word
of
him
since
you
never
told
me
you
had
seen
him
in
rome
said
maria
with
some
surprise
a
slight
blush
fluttered
over
lady
anne
cheek
as
she
answered
did
i
not
well
love
i
dare
say
something
prevented
me
i
do
not
know
what
and
shall
not
stop
to
inquire
now
for
my
second
point
colonel
middleton
do
you
not
think
it
very
rude
for
a
lady
and
a
young
lady
too
who
should
of
course
be
full
of
prim
propriety
to
stare
at
a
gentleman
for
full
two
minutes
when
she
is
first
introduced
to
him
maria
dear
will
you
order
me
a
cup
of
coffee
or
a
glass
of
wine
or
something
for
i
am
either
quite
mad
or
very
ill
or
very
happy
or
very
something
and
she
sank
quietly
and
gracefully
into
a
large
armchair
near
and
covered
her
eyes
with
her
gloved
hands
you
are
indeed
very
wild
said
maria
ringing
the
bell
but
lady
anne
did
not
answer
till
the
servant
had
come
and
gone
while
henry
and
maria
exchanged
looks
of
doubt
and
surprise
some
wine
and
some
biscuits
were
brought
and
the
servant
again
retired
but
lady
anne
did
not
rise
speak
or
uncover
her
eyes
till
maria
really
alarmed
lest
she
should
be
ill
touched
her
gently
on
the
arm
saying
dear
anne
here
is
the
wine
pray
take
some
are
you
ill
no
no
no
said
lady
anne
i
will
not
have
any
i
will
do
better
she
withdrew
her
hands
from
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
and
there
were
evident
marks
of
tears
upon
her
cheek
you
have
not
answered
me
colonel
middleton
she
said
and
i
will
answer
for
you
it
was
very
rude
or
rather
it
would
have
been
very
rude
had
there
not
been
a
cause
but
do
you
know
sir
you
are
so
very
like
a
dear
friend
whom
i
have
lost
a
friend
of
childhood
and
of
early
days
a
friend
of
all
who
were
most
dear
to
me
one
whom
i
loved
as
a
brother
though
i
often
used
to
tease
him
sadly
and
who
loved
me
in
the
same
way
too
though
he
used
to
love
this
dear
beautiful
girl
here
better
that
in
a
moment
when
i
saw
you
the
brightest
and
the
sweetest
part
of
life
came
back
and
then
i
remembered
his
hard
fate
and
shameful
treatment
and
i
thought
i
should
have
gone
mad
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
gazed
at
him
earnestly
again
and
then
starting
up
she
cried
but
what
is
the
use
of
all
this
do
you
not
know
me
do
you
pretend
to
have
forgotten
me
i
am
anne
mellent
henry
henry
did
you
think
you
could
hide
yourself
from
me
or
her
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
warmly
henry
hayley
took
it
and
pressed
it
in
his
own
saying
i
can
not
and
will
not
attempt
to
deceive
you
dear
lady
anne
but
yet
i
must
beg
you
to
keep
my
secret
faithfully
for
some
time
at
least
till
i
have
resolved
upon
my
course
be
sure
of
that
henry
replied
lady
anne
thoughtfully
your
course
must
be
well
thought
of
but
i
will
be
one
of
the
council
as
well
as
maria
nay
more
she
added
with
a
sparkling
look
as
she
has
had
one
long
conference
with
you
all
alone
i
will
have
one
also
it
shall
be
this
very
night
too
in
my
own
house
here
there
do
not
look
surprised
maria
you
know
my
reputation
is
not
made
of
very
brittle
materials
or
it
would
have
been
broken
to
pieces
long
ago
yours
is
a
very
different
sort
of
thing
you
have
spoiled
it
by
over
tenderness
like
a
child
and
made
it
so
delicate
that
it
will
not
bear
rough
handling
i
was
resolved
that
mine
should
be
more
robust
and
therefore
set
out
with
accustoming
it
to
everything
i
do
believe
that
half
the
things
i
have
done
in
life
were
merely
performed
to
establish
a
character
for
doing
anything
i
pleased
they
could
but
say
that
anne
mellent
was
mad
and
i
took
care
not
to
go
the
length
that
is
what
were
maria
monkton
sensations
it
would
be
hardly
fair
to
inquire
she
had
often
talked
with
lady
anne
of
henry
hayley
and
had
often
heard
her
express
the
same
feelings
towards
him
which
were
now
so
openly
displayed
but
perhaps
she
had
listened
with
more
pleasure
while
they
both
thought
him
dead
than
she
did
now
i
do
not
say
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
that
would
be
a
very
serious
assertion
not
to
be
made
without
proof
the
little
prince
of
gods
and
men
does
not
always
wing
his
way
in
a
direct
course
and
if
he
was
at
all
busy
with
fair
maria
heart
she
was
quite
ignorant
of
the
fact
she
had
thought
all
her
life
a
good
deal
about
henry
hayley
it
is
true
she
had
liked
him
better
remembered
him
with
fonder
regard
than
any
one
whom
she
had
ever
known
she
had
pitied
him
wept
for
him
and
within
the
last
hour
she
had
felt
more
and
stronger
emotions
on
his
account
than
she
had
ever
felt
for
any
one
on
earth
but
still
all
this
might
be
without
love
the
sensations
the
most
decidedly
like
that
passion
which
she
experienced
were
certainly
those
which
lady
anne
affectionate
greeting
and
frank
unfearing
invitation
called
up
in
her
bosom
she
felt
inclined
to
think
her
friend
odder
than
ever
to
wish
that
she
was
not
quite
so
odd
but
maria
was
a
frank
and
generous
character
and
although
she
could
not
banish
some
of
weaknesses
entirely
yet
whenever
she
found
them
out
she
felt
ashamed
of
them
and
tried
to
repress
them
why
should
i
be
vexed
with
her
conduct
just
now
she
asked
herself
is
she
not
always
the
same
and
are
not
all
her
eccentricities
amiable
whether
lady
anne
perceived
what
was
passing
in
her
friend
bosom
from
the
varied
expressions
which
flitted
over
her
countenance
or
whether
she
only
suspected
it
from
the
intuitive
knowledge
which
almost
every
woman
has
of
woman
heart
i
can
not
tell
but
after
an
instant
pause
she
went
on
with
a
slight
toss
of
her
head
saying
after
all
you
know
maria
at
the
worst
they
could
but
say
i
was
in
love
with
him
and
he
with
me
and
besides
knowing
ourselves
that
it
is
no
such
thing
we
could
soon
prove
to
them
that
there
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
so
now
henry
you
will
come
to
the
lodge
will
you
not
after
dinner
i
mean
about
nine
i
had
intended
to
return
to
london
replied
henry
hesitating
without
seeing
me
at
all
exclaimed
lady
anne
that
is
unpardonable
i
could
punish
you
if
i
would
henry
i
could
punish
you
if
i
would
but
i
will
be
generous
you
are
mistaken
indeed
answered
henry
eagerly
i
intended
to
see
you
as
miss
monkton
can
tell
you
indeed
my
first
visit
was
destined
to
harley
lodge
but
she
thought
i
should
find
no
one
there
but
servants
miss
monkton
exclaimed
lady
anne
with
a
gay
laugh
do
you
intend
to
let
him
go
on
calling
you
that
name
maria
oh
those
prim
proprieties
how
i
hate
them
that
ten
years
should
make
such
a
difference
between
people
who
have
been
like
brothers
and
sisters
all
their
lives
but
i
suppose
that
the
human
heart
is
like
that
stone
which
is
soft
enough
and
easily
formed
when
first
dug
but
hardens
by
exposure
to
the
air
he
was
indeed
going
to
the
lodge
when
i
met
him
accidentally
said
maria
and
i
did
tell
him
that
he
would
find
no
one
there
for
i
thought
you
were
in
london
whether
you
were
right
or
wrong
depends
upon
how
long
he
has
been
with
you
answered
lady
anne
with
a
malicious
twinkle
of
the
eyes
the
truth
is
i
drove
down
with
my
beautiful
ponies
about
an
hour
ago
lodged
my
dear
old
governess
at
the
rectory
where
she
is
going
to
dine
stopped
at
the
lodge
for
two
minutes
to
tell
them
to
get
something
ready
and
then
came
on
here
with
a
sort
of
second
sight
i
suppose
and
now
i
will
return
insisting
upon
your
coming
at
the
time
stated
and
giving
me
a
full
account
of
yourself
henry
i
can
not
ask
you
to
dinner
not
because
it
would
be
improper
for
that
i
should
like
beyond
everything
but
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
house
i
believe
but
three
or
four
eggs
i
must
go
however
for
it
is
growing
dusk
and
those
wild
young
things
of
mine
are
as
fresh
as
if
they
had
come
out
of
the
stable
a
minute
ago
henry
rose
to
conduct
her
to
her
carriage
but
before
they
reached
the
door
of
the
hall
lady
anne
stopped
saying
go
on
colonel
middleton
i
want
to
speak
one
word
more
to
maria
and
running
back
into
the
library
she
threw
her
arms
round
her
beautiful
friend
saying
oh
is
not
this
joyful
maria
i
trust
it
may
prove
so
for
him
poor
fellow
replied
maria
with
a
sigh
but
i
have
many
fears
and
i
none
said
lady
anne
but
you
have
thought
me
stranger
than
ever
dear
girl
i
have
seen
it
all
the
time
but
never
fear
it
will
all
come
right
i
love
him
very
much
maria
but
i
am
not
in
love
with
him
i
care
not
what
the
world
says
for
the
world
will
find
itself
a
fool
as
it
so
often
does
when
it
sees
me
his
wife
bridesmaid
as
i
intend
to
be
but
mind
i
warn
you
i
intend
to
do
everything
that
is
odd
in
the
mean
time
so
that
every
one
will
think
but
you
maria
but
you
that
i
am
making
love
to
him
in
open
day
will
not
mistake
me
i
think
and
away
she
went
again
with
a
gay
light
step
leaving
maria
monkton
with
her
eyes
ready
to
run
over
under
the
influence
of
emotions
strange
and
new
what
am
i
feeling
what
am
i
doing
were
questions
that
flashed
through
her
mind
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
but
before
she
could
answer
them
henry
was
again
by
her
side
there
was
a
look
of
hope
and
light
in
his
eyes
which
agitated
her
more
than
before
and
she
was
about
to
sit
down
to
hide
as
far
as
possible
her
emotion
but
henry
took
her
hand
saying
dear
maria
it
is
growing
dark
and
i
do
not
think
you
would
wish
me
to
stay
longer
with
you
at
present
but
yet
before
i
go
for
we
may
not
easily
perhaps
find
such
a
moment
of
happy
privacy
for
a
long
time
let
me
say
that
which
some
words
which
have
been
spoken
induce
me
to
say
sooner
than
i
otherwise
would
have
done
oh
we
shall
easily
find
moments
to
converse
replied
maria
catching
at
the
first
pause
and
making
a
great
effort
to
delay
what
she
was
sure
would
overcome
her
nay
not
so
answered
henry
i
must
not
leave
you
now
doubtful
as
to
any
part
of
my
conduct
he
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
earnestly
tenderly
and
as
by
the
faint
light
he
saw
her
eyes
cast
down
her
glowing
cheek
and
trembling
form
he
went
on
rapidly
you
know
me
too
well
maria
you
judge
me
and
have
ever
judged
me
too
nobly
to
suppose
that
i
would
seek
to
bind
you
to
the
fate
of
an
exile
an
outcast
or
even
a
suspected
man
i
ask
you
not
to
tell
me
any
of
your
own
feelings
towards
me
i
ask
you
not
even
to
say
one
word
of
your
own
situation
your
heart
your
hand
even
may
be
engaged
to
some
happier
man
oh
no
no
she
cried
no
the
words
rushed
from
her
heart
burst
from
her
lips
without
the
act
of
her
will
but
she
felt
that
she
had
never
loved
till
then
and
they
would
be
spoken
thank
god
said
henry
in
a
low
voice
and
then
added
well
then
dearest
maria
my
mind
is
made
up
i
will
cast
this
load
from
me
i
will
clear
myself
of
all
doubt
if
it
be
in
human
power
to
do
so
and
if
it
be
done
if
i
stand
before
the
whole
world
exculpated
from
all
charges
but
of
deep
perhaps
too
deep
devotion
to
a
father
then
i
will
tell
you
how
henry
hayley
has
loved
and
thought
of
you
from
boyhood
till
now
how
he
loves
you
still
how
he
will
love
you
till
his
last
hour
you
will
find
that
his
course
has
not
been
dishonourable
or
inglorious
and
you
shall
decide
whether
he
is
to
be
as
happy
as
his
boyish
dreams
once
pictured
and
now
farewell
for
the
present
he
pressed
his
lips
upon
her
hand
and
was
departing
but
a
soft
low
musical
voice
caught
his
ear
ere
he
reached
the
door
henry
it
said
oh
not
yet
henry
do
not
leave
me
yet
henry
hayley
turned
at
once
and
seated
himself
beside
her
he
took
her
hand
and
it
remained
in
his
and
when
he
at
length
departed
the
sky
was
quite
dark
but
his
heart
had
daylight
in
itself
chapter
xi
three
chapters
to
one
group
of
people
is
almost
more
than
it
is
fair
to
allow
and
yet
the
fact
of
there
being
three
in
the
group
as
well
as
a
strong
predilection
on
my
own
part
for
chronological
progression
must
excuse
my
remaining
attached
to
henry
hayley
and
his
fair
companions
at
least
till
that
day
had
reached
its
close
now
the
period
of
a
day
close
may
be
differently
estimated
according
as
a
man
is
astronomical
judaical
ecclesiastical
or
chronological
some
will
have
it
that
sunset
closes
the
day
some
say
midnight
is
the
day
end
which
of
course
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
some
one
hour
some
another
but
as
men
have
never
been
agreed
upon
the
subject
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
i
am
decidedly
fond
of
paradoxes
i
prefer
midnight
and
therefore
declare
that
when
i
say
the
close
of
the
day
i
mean
neither
more
nor
less
than
twelve
at
night
with
a
light
and
joyful
step
henry
hayley
took
his
way
through
the
park
where
he
had
so
often
played
in
infancy
and
boyhood
towards
one
of
the
two
lodges
selecting
that
one
the
gates
of
which
opened
upon
the
road
near
a
little
village
at
which
he
had
left
the
that
brought
him
from
london
the
moon
just
risen
and
not
far
from
the
full
showed
him
many
an
old
familiar
sight
and
the
happiness
of
his
own
heart
harmonized
so
well
with
the
pleasant
memories
of
the
past
that
he
almost
fancied
himself
a
boy
again
and
all
the
terrible
realities
of
the
last
ten
years
nothing
but
a
painful
dream
there
was
one
thing
indeed
which
might
have
proved
to
him
that
it
was
not
so
that
there
was
a
wide
interval
between
the
past
and
the
present
and
that
was
the
sensation
of
passion
yes
there
was
now
passion
in
his
bosom
passion
which
had
not
been
there
before
passion
which
even
at
the
dawn
of
morning
he
had
not
felt
let
not
the
reader
marvel
there
are
certainly
such
things
occasionally
as
love
at
first
sight
but
with
him
it
was
very
different
if
the
eye
which
runs
over
these
lines
saw
the
sun
rise
as
often
as
mine
does
i
see
him
open
the
curtains
of
the
night
i
believe
more
frequently
than
any
man
in
england
more
frequently
even
than
the
matutinal
labourer
of
the
fields
if
any
reader
i
say
saw
the
sun
rise
as
often
as
i
do
he
would
understand
the
whole
process
of
henry
love
in
a
moment
not
that
it
had
anything
to
do
with
sunrise
or
with
sunset
or
with
the
rising
southing
and
setting
of
the
moon
but
there
is
a
certain
comfortable
arrangement
which
every
early
riser
practises
or
should
practise
in
the
winter
and
which
perfectly
explains
henry
hayley
case
you
direct
the
housemaid
to
take
a
bundle
of
dry
sticks
called
in
some
places
a
fagot
in
other
parts
of
the
country
a
bavin
in
london
men
use
square
bits
of
deal
and
laying
them
artistically
with
sufficient
spaces
between
them
to
allow
the
air
to
pass
to
place
over
them
a
mass
or
quantity
of
paper
such
a
manuscript
as
this
would
do
very
well
but
a
newspaper
is
better
for
a
thousand
to
one
it
contains
more
inflammable
materials
over
all
you
superinduce
a
thin
and
pervious
stratum
of
bituminous
coal
and
then
in
the
morning
when
you
rise
you
put
a
candle
lighted
to
the
paper
and
the
whole
mass
is
in
a
blaze
in
a
moment
now
in
henry
hayley
case
fate
had
been
the
housemaid
the
friendships
and
affections
of
youth
piled
one
above
the
other
had
been
the
wood
nicely
laid
the
paper
might
perhaps
be
represented
by
all
the
longing
eager
memories
and
fancies
of
and
regarding
the
fair
companion
of
his
youth
during
the
last
long
ten
years
a
warm
earnest
ardent
heart
was
the
inflammable
coal
at
the
top
and
the
sudden
sight
and
tender
interest
and
kindly
affection
of
maria
were
the
light
which
kindled
the
flame
in
a
moment
he
had
in
short
met
her
that
night
loving
her
very
much
and
he
left
her
loving
her
as
much
as
it
is
possible
for
man
to
love
he
went
through
the
park
then
with
the
spirit
of
the
past
and
the
present
on
either
hand
leading
him
through
paths
of
fairy
flowers
to
scenes
of
imaginary
happiness
ah
that
quarter
of
an
hour
was
well
worth
the
ten
years
of
suffering
he
could
hardly
make
up
his
mind
to
pass
the
gates
but
there
was
no
use
in
lingering
and
he
sped
on
such
a
frugal
dinner
as
he
wanted
was
easily
obtained
at
the
little
for
it
did
not
deserve
the
name
of
an
inn
and
when
it
was
over
he
still
sat
for
a
time
and
thought
of
maria
not
of
lady
anne
till
his
watch
which
he
had
laid
on
the
table
showed
him
that
it
was
time
to
depart
for
his
next
visit
then
indeed
he
turned
his
mind
to
her
whom
he
was
so
soon
to
see
but
still
henry
hayley
was
a
gentleman
not
in
manners
alone
but
in
heart
and
mind
and
a
gentleman
never
misunderstands
a
woman
there
was
not
one
thought
in
his
bosom
which
could
have
pained
or
offended
lady
anne
if
she
had
seen
them
all
she
is
a
dear
kind
good
girl
he
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
on
and
still
so
like
what
she
was
as
a
child
happy
state
happy
character
which
changes
not
with
the
hard
world
experience
which
has
no
need
to
change
mistress
of
herself
her
actions
and
her
fortune
armed
in
honesty
of
purpose
and
purity
of
heart
why
should
she
bend
the
finest
feelings
and
the
noblest
principles
to
the
cold
rules
of
the
world
the
was
soon
reached
the
grounds
were
soon
passed
through
and
when
he
stood
under
the
portico
and
stretched
out
his
hand
to
the
bell
the
village
clock
clear
and
musical
struck
nine
i
am
to
the
moment
he
thought
and
i
am
glad
of
it
i
would
not
repay
such
regard
with
the
slightest
appearance
of
neglect
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
showed
no
wonder
at
the
sight
of
a
young
and
very
handsome
stranger
asking
to
see
lady
anne
at
that
hour
of
the
night
all
her
servants
had
given
up
wondering
at
lady
arnie
long
ago
giving
his
name
as
colonel
middleton
henry
was
at
once
led
to
the
where
she
was
sitting
and
as
soon
as
he
had
entered
the
door
was
closed
she
at
once
rose
from
the
book
she
had
been
reading
and
advanced
to
meet
him
with
both
her
hands
stretched
out
he
took
them
affectionately
and
to
his
surprise
she
raised
her
face
to
his
and
kissed
his
check
there
henry
she
said
now
that
i
have
astonished
you
enough
i
will
try
and
be
reasonable
and
first
that
you
may
not
think
me
anything
but
very
mad
i
will
tell
you
something
but
first
sit
down
by
me
here
well
i
was
going
to
say
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
you
are
to
marry
maria
monkton
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
there
were
tears
upon
her
cheek
when
i
came
in
and
love
enough
in
your
eyes
to
show
me
the
whole
then
again
as
i
have
told
charles
marston
if
he
asks
me
some
day
when
i
am
in
a
good
humour
i
may
marry
him
it
is
all
arranged
and
now
you
think
me
odder
stranger
wilder
than
ever
and
i
believe
it
is
so
for
the
very
great
joy
of
seeing
you
again
when
every
one
but
myself
believed
you
dead
has
carried
me
quite
away
and
did
you
not
then
believe
me
dead
lady
anne
asked
henry
do
not
call
me
that
odious
name
she
answered
and
then
added
only
half
i
doubted
and
so
did
my
poor
father
till
his
last
hour
little
reason
had
we
to
doubt
it
is
true
but
still
you
know
henry
doubt
is
a
very
clinging
plant
look
here
she
continued
raising
a
light
from
the
table
and
leading
the
way
through
chairs
and
sofas
and
various
sorts
of
furniture
to
the
other
side
of
the
large
room
look
here
do
you
know
whose
picture
this
is
mine
answered
henry
with
a
smile
what
could
tempt
you
to
buy
it
i
did
not
buy
it
she
said
it
was
given
to
me
and
i
have
always
hoped
faintly
fearfully
but
still
hoped
to
see
that
face
again
the
face
of
the
brother
of
my
girlhood
i
one
time
thought
of
giving
it
to
maria
for
i
knew
it
would
be
a
comfort
and
a
consolation
to
her
but
i
had
not
the
heart
and
now
of
course
you
will
have
another
painted
for
her
which
will
please
her
better
as
it
will
be
more
like
the
present
that
will
do
well
for
me
it
is
the
henry
of
my
remembrance
it
must
be
owned
that
henry
hayley
was
puzzled
he
had
seen
and
observed
many
women
acting
in
many
circumstances
but
he
had
never
yet
seen
sisterly
affection
so
warmly
so
plainly
displayed
towards
any
one
not
actually
akin
to
her
who
felt
it
yet
let
there
be
no
mistake
he
did
not
misunderstand
lady
anne
mellent
for
an
instant
he
did
not
suppose
that
she
was
moved
towards
him
by
any
feelings
but
those
which
she
acknowledged
but
he
thought
and
thought
with
a
sigh
that
those
feelings
might
be
misunderstood
by
others
for
the
world
rarely
if
ever
as
he
well
knew
understands
perfect
sincerity
of
character
he
saw
however
that
his
love
for
maria
was
not
to
be
concealed
from
her
and
therefore
that
there
was
no
use
in
attempting
to
hide
it
and
he
answered
you
must
not
suppose
dear
lady
that
all
my
hopes
and
wishes
are
so
near
attainment
as
to
justify
me
in
even
dreaming
of
painted
pictures
there
is
much
to
be
thought
of
much
to
be
considered
first
you
must
be
aware
that
i
am
even
now
in
a
very
dangerous
situation
and
although
i
need
not
tell
you
i
am
innocent
of
all
that
was
ever
laid
to
my
charge
though
i
think
i
can
prove
my
innocence
and
am
resolved
to
attempt
it
yet
there
is
peril
even
in
the
attempt
lady
anne
smiled
gaily
i
do
indeed
know
you
are
innocent
she
said
and
my
dear
father
knew
you
were
innocent
he
told
me
so
himself
upon
the
bed
of
death
she
added
a
grave
shade
spreading
over
her
fair
face
he
saw
hayley
for
some
hours
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
from
a
terrible
accident
he
met
with
and
from
his
lips
he
heard
and
knew
the
whole
but
now
henry
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
your
history
for
satisfied
that
you
are
here
living
and
well
i
have
hitherto
asked
you
no
questions
but
still
there
must
be
a
strange
tale
to
be
told
for
even
hayley
himself
was
fully
convinced
of
your
death
till
his
own
last
hour
after
you
have
done
i
have
something
to
give
you
which
my
father
left
you
if
ever
you
should
appear
again
he
gave
me
other
directions
also
which
i
ought
to
have
acted
upon
before
but
which
whether
fortunately
or
not
i
can
not
say
i
have
not
acted
upon
in
my
thoughtless
levity
as
yet
they
were
to
make
public
what
i
knew
of
your
innocence
and
of
the
circumstances
which
cast
suspicion
upon
you
as
soon
as
hayley
was
dead
but
i
have
been
absent
from
england
roaming
about
and
since
my
return
i
forgot
it
all
i
am
glad
you
have
not
as
yet
said
anything
upon
the
subject
replied
henry
thoughtfully
your
unsupported
testimony
of
what
your
kind
and
excellent
father
believed
would
do
little
legally
to
establish
my
innocence
and
i
should
wish
to
make
every
preparation
before
i
discover
myself
at
present
i
am
so
far
safe
although
i
now
see
that
those
who
knew
me
well
may
recognise
me
more
easily
than
i
had
imagined
no
one
can
prove
my
identity
with
henry
hayley
while
i
can
establish
by
proofs
which
can
not
be
controverted
that
i
am
frank
middleton
the
son
of
an
english
gentleman
and
a
spanish
lady
step
by
step
from
infancy
to
manhood
i
can
show
my
identity
with
that
person
without
by
one
word
from
my
own
mouth
violating
truth
in
the
slightest
degree
the
spanish
now
in
london
would
at
any
time
swear
that
i
am
the
son
of
middleton
having
seen
me
many
times
at
the
house
of
her
uncle
recognised
as
her
son
by
all
the
family
this
character
i
shall
certainly
keep
up
for
some
time
till
i
have
carefully
sought
for
and
arranged
all
the
evidence
that
is
yet
to
be
found
regarding
that
transaction
which
condemned
me
to
ten
years
of
exile
and
disgrace
nay
listen
for
depend
upon
it
such
things
are
not
so
easily
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
court
of
law
as
kind
and
inexperienced
hearts
like
yours
and
dear
maria
are
willing
to
believe
nevertheless
i
do
think
my
innocence
can
be
established
for
in
corroboration
of
a
paper
which
my
father
gave
me
acknowledging
the
act
as
his
and
exculpating
me
some
of
the
innkeepers
at
whose
houses
i
staid
while
seeking
your
father
in
northumberland
and
in
wales
must
still
be
living
and
can
show
that
i
was
not
as
has
been
asserted
flying
from
justice
with
the
money
obtained
by
forgery
but
eagerly
following
a
nobleman
of
unimpeached
honour
upon
business
of
importance
i
think
it
will
not
be
difficult
in
short
to
prove
every
step
of
my
course
so
as
to
bear
out
fact
after
fact
of
the
plain
and
simple
tale
i
have
to
tell
i
must
also
seek
and
find
my
poor
aunt
as
soon
as
possible
not
only
for
affection
sake
but
because
i
feel
almost
certain
that
sooner
or
later
my
father
must
have
told
her
the
truth
i
will
therefore
beseech
you
dear
lady
anne
to
keep
my
secret
with
the
utmost
care
for
some
weeks
to
come
and
not
to
betray
any
recognition
of
me
as
henry
hayley
by
a
word
a
look
or
a
sign
that
i
will
promise
and
faithfully
perform
henry
replied
lady
anne
with
a
smile
but
still
we
have
much
to
talk
of
and
first
tell
me
all
your
history
and
then
i
will
tell
mine
in
return
the
same
tale
was
told
by
henry
to
his
present
auditor
as
had
been
told
to
maria
monkton
though
not
exactly
in
the
same
words
though
somewhat
drier
in
the
details
and
though
more
a
relation
of
mere
facts
than
of
facts
and
feelings
mingled
as
it
had
been
to
maria
yet
it
took
long
in
telling
and
before
it
was
concluded
the
sound
of
a
carriage
driving
up
hurried
him
to
the
end
that
is
brice
my
old
governess
who
lives
with
me
still
said
lady
anne
henry
there
is
much
more
to
be
said
you
must
come
to
me
evening
in
london
i
will
contrive
to
get
rid
of
her
there
here
perhaps
i
could
not
manage
it
without
paining
the
good
creature
and
awakening
her
attention
too
closely
to
yourself
come
and
dine
with
me
at
seven
and
tell
maria
not
to
be
jealous
henry
promised
and
the
next
moment
brice
entered
the
room
after
an
introduction
to
that
lady
by
lady
anne
delivered
in
an
easy
commonplace
tone
the
visiter
took
his
leave
and
in
after
was
on
his
way
back
to
london
chapter
xii
it
was
about
eleven
in
the
day
the
london
thunder
had
not
begun
there
might
be
a
few
carts
creeping
about
the
streets
but
they
crept
lazily
and
almost
silently
the
rattle
of
a
might
be
heard
here
and
there
but
still
it
was
but
a
temporary
rattle
and
the
comparative
stillness
of
the
whole
town
gave
a
dreamy
sort
of
quietude
to
the
air
which
was
pleasant
and
full
of
repose
it
harmonized
well
with
the
character
of
the
day
too
for
it
was
quite
a
summer
morning
the
sun
was
streaming
into
lady
fleetwood
sending
oblique
rays
over
the
corner
of
the
houses
of
a
neighbouring
street
and
the
motes
were
dancing
drowsily
in
the
long
pencils
of
light
a
droning
fly
which
had
somehow
or
other
got
into
a
deep
blue
and
could
not
get
out
again
was
buzzing
as
if
it
had
nearly
tired
itself
to
sleep
and
the
waving
of
the
plants
at
the
open
windows
stirred
by
a
light
air
had
a
slumberous
sound
with
it
really
this
is
very
pleasant
thought
lady
fleetwood
as
she
sat
after
breakfast
enjoying
the
delicious
sensation
of
life
which
a
fine
summer
day
gives
it
is
all
so
calm
and
tranquil
that
one
could
almost
go
to
sleep
strange
strange
life
that
one
of
thy
best
blessings
should
be
to
lose
the
consciousness
of
thine
existence
she
soon
found
however
that
to
go
to
sleep
was
not
for
her
hardly
had
the
thought
passed
through
her
brain
when
a
sharp
double
knock
at
the
door
dispelled
the
stillness
and
the
next
moment
charles
marston
the
incarnation
of
mobility
entered
well
my
dear
aunt
he
said
i
have
determined
upon
my
course
for
the
day
laid
out
everything
in
the
most
methodical
and
scientific
manner
and
having
just
to
spare
came
to
bestow
it
upon
you
you
should
really
go
and
see
your
uncle
my
dear
charles
replied
lady
fleetwood
it
would
have
been
much
better
to
have
given
it
to
him
instead
of
to
me
for
he
may
well
be
offended
if
he
hears
you
have
been
here
twice
without
going
near
him
you
are
wrong
dearest
of
aunts
you
are
wrong
answered
charles
you
always
are
sweetly
wrong
you
know
most
excellent
of
women
i
sent
ago
to
ask
if
he
was
at
home
for
although
one
may
have
to
swallow
a
bitter
pill
now
and
then
there
is
no
reason
why
one
should
needlessly
walk
a
mile
and
a
half
to
take
it
but
he
was
out
and
so
when
i
go
hence
i
shall
diligently
pursue
him
to
his
dingy
hole
in
the
city
where
pray
heaven
there
may
be
plenty
of
business
stirring
to
cut
our
conference
short
i
am
now
only
waiting
for
winkworth
who
is
going
to
the
city
too
i
can
not
think
charles
why
you
should
feel
such
a
distaste
to
your
uncle
conversation
said
lady
fleetwood
meditating
upon
the
problem
everybody
admits
he
is
a
clever
man
undoubtedly
my
dear
aunt
replied
charles
but
i
will
tell
you
why
i
am
not
very
fond
of
his
conversation
it
is
because
that
same
conversation
of
his
transforms
everything
into
arithmetic
now
i
never
had
an
arithmetical
head
in
my
life
i
know
that
two
and
two
make
four
but
it
has
not
been
the
study
of
my
life
to
discover
how
many
blue
beans
make
five
i
can
not
calculate
friendships
by
the
rules
of
profit
and
loss
nor
look
on
love
upon
the
principles
of
tare
and
tret
nor
subject
every
feeling
of
the
heart
to
the
computations
of
the
nor
measure
poetry
by
the
square
foot
nor
extract
the
cube
root
of
an
acquaintance
purse
in
order
to
estimate
how
intimate
i
should
become
with
him
nor
regulate
my
own
thoughts
and
wishes
by
quadratic
equations
nor
always
keep
my
own
conduct
and
purposes
within
an
exact
parallelogram
the
sages
of
laputa
must
have
been
great
bores
my
dear
aunt
but
they
were
nothing
depend
upon
it
to
the
men
of
the
present
day
who
subject
not
only
their
understandings
but
their
very
emotions
to
the
stiffest
rules
of
calculation
besides
the
sight
of
poor
miss
hayley
has
not
altogether
taught
me
to
like
my
uncle
better
nor
has
what
you
said
about
him
it
to
her
lady
fleetwood
looked
scared
and
in
a
moment
her
mind
ran
back
to
all
that
had
passed
during
the
preceding
evening
to
ascertain
if
she
could
possibly
by
any
blunder
have
said
aught
to
produce
mischief
between
uncle
and
nephew
why
my
dear
charles
she
exclaimed
i
am
very
sure
that
i
never
uttered
one
word
to
make
you
believe
that
your
uncle
is
at
all
aware
of
the
poor
thing
condition
he
would
be
the
first
i
am
sure
i
never
said
you
did
my
dear
aunt
he
replied
interrupting
her
but
you
told
me
he
had
been
angry
because
you
went
to
see
them
in
their
distress
at
highgate
i
have
a
strong
notion
he
did
not
behave
well
to
poor
hayley
i
remember
something
of
an
unsettled
account
oh
but
poor
uncle
always
said
that
as
soon
as
hayley
produced
certain
papers
he
would
go
into
that
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
i
remember
quite
well
that
hayley
always
declared
there
was
a
large
sum
due
to
him
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
pounds
and
he
declared
once
that
he
would
put
it
into
chancery
or
some
law
court
but
he
lost
heart
poor
man
after
the
sad
business
of
henry
death
and
though
he
talked
a
great
deal
he
never
did
anything
but
now
i
recollect
that
was
what
made
your
uncle
so
angry
charles
he
said
hayley
had
defamed
him
and
you
know
your
uncle
is
always
reckoned
a
highly
honourable
man
though
a
little
too
fond
of
money
perhaps
rich
men
are
always
honourable
men
replied
charles
in
a
graver
tone
than
was
customary
with
him
and
poor
and
unfortunate
men
are
great
rascals
in
the
world
opinion
my
dear
aunt
in
this
good
country
of
ours
wealth
does
find
ways
if
not
to
corrupt
justice
at
least
to
fix
the
balance
and
the
sword
immoveable
law
is
too
expensive
a
luxury
for
poor
men
to
treat
themselves
to
much
of
it
and
many
an
honest
cause
is
lost
for
fear
of
the
inseparable
punishment
in
this
land
of
seeking
right
by
law
i
mean
expense
if
not
ruin
i
remember
hearing
a
clerk
give
a
message
to
hayley
exactly
to
the
purport
you
mention
that
scriven
had
no
time
to
write
but
that
he
would
go
into
the
account
whenever
hayley
was
prepared
to
produce
the
papers
do
you
know
what
hayley
replied
my
dear
aunt
he
was
then
in
a
shabby
black
coat
and
his
face
looked
as
if
he
had
been
drinking
i
must
confess
but
he
spoke
distinctly
and
bitterly
so
good
as
to
ask
scriven
he
said
i
am
to
do
that
when
all
those
papers
were
left
here
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
get
them
out
of
this
house
and
with
a
fierce
imprecation
upon
my
head
he
walked
away
without
waiting
for
an
answer
i
was
witness
to
the
whole
and
a
sad
scene
it
was
oh
dear
that
is
very
terrible
said
lady
fleetwood
but
do
you
think
it
could
be
true
charles
i
really
do
not
know
my
dear
aunt
answered
her
nephew
but
i
have
a
sort
of
feeling
that
the
hayleys
have
suffered
by
our
family
and
consequently
as
i
am
quite
sure
this
poor
thing
whom
i
saw
upon
frimley
common
is
one
of
them
i
have
resolved
to
go
down
again
this
very
day
and
see
what
can
be
done
for
her
winkworth
will
go
with
me
and
as
he
is
one
upon
whose
advice
i
can
fully
rely
i
shall
consult
him
in
regard
to
all
i
do
for
her
but
dear
me
then
you
will
not
see
maria
said
lady
fleetwood
she
will
be
here
by
two
oh
yes
i
shall
answered
charles
we
do
not
set
out
till
three
and
i
shall
be
back
from
the
city
by
two
lady
fleetwood
arrangements
were
all
deranged
she
had
planned
a
pleasant
little
for
charles
winkworth
and
maria
at
which
she
proposed
to
engage
winkworth
in
conversation
with
herself
while
charles
and
maria
would
be
thrown
upon
each
hands
entirely
and
she
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
being
a
fine
politician
in
her
way
that
what
between
maria
natural
charms
a
sudden
meeting
after
a
long
absence
and
a
great
many
other
advantages
of
the
same
kind
love
and
matrimony
would
as
naturally
rise
up
as
the
flame
of
a
when
a
match
is
applied
to
it
we
must
remark
that
lady
fleetwood
never
doubted
for
a
moment
that
any
of
her
plans
would
succeed
nor
did
the
experience
of
more
than
twenty
years
during
which
period
every
one
that
she
had
ever
formed
had
broken
to
pieces
convince
her
that
there
was
always
somehow
or
another
some
element
wanting
in
her
calculations
which
ensured
their
failure
she
laid
defeat
upon
the
back
of
accident
one
of
the
three
or
four
accessories
to
human
infirmities
which
bear
all
the
sins
and
misadventures
of
the
world
the
scapegoats
of
conscience
and
accident
the
devil
and
adverse
circumstances
are
the
favourite
deputies
to
whom
we
transfer
the
burden
of
our
faults
in
the
present
day
since
zeus
and
his
olympian
household
are
no
longer
chargeable
as
in
the
days
of
homer
perverse
mankind
whose
wills
created
free
charge
all
their
woes
on
absolute
decree
all
to
the
dooming
gods
their
guilt
translate
and
follies
are
miscalled
the
crimes
of
fate
accident
was
lady
fleetwood
and
she
thought
it
a
most
unfortunate
accident
indeed
that
charles
had
arranged
to
go
with
winkworth
into
the
country
that
evening
rather
than
stay
and
fall
in
love
with
his
cousin
upon
her
plan
while
she
was
thinking
however
of
how
she
could
induce
him
to
give
up
his
journey
for
the
day
and
balancing
with
nice
casuistry
whether
she
ought
or
ought
not
to
try
kindly
feeling
for
poor
miss
hayley
pulling
her
one
way
and
a
natural
hankering
for
her
own
schemes
tugging
her
the
other
the
knocker
was
again
heard
doing
its
function
and
her
servant
a
moment
after
announced
that
winkworth
was
below
waiting
for
marston
oh
ask
him
up
by
all
means
said
lady
fleetwood
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
him
i
asked
him
my
lady
replied
the
man
but
he
said
he
had
no
time
at
the
present
moment
lady
fleetwood
would
have
pressed
the
point
but
charles
represented
that
if
they
did
not
set
out
for
the
city
at
once
he
should
not
be
back
in
time
to
see
his
cousin
and
ran
without
delay
under
any
ordinary
circumstances
the
solitary
meditations
of
a
lady
on
the
sear
side
of
fifty
can
be
of
no
great
interest
to
the
general
reader
there
is
something
in
youth
in
its
freshness
its
vigour
its
excitability
its
world
of
emotions
which
renders
the
young
mind
as
well
as
the
young
frame
in
its
bloom
and
perfection
a
pleasant
object
of
contemplation
but
with
age
alas
it
is
seldom
so
i
will
therefore
only
say
that
good
lady
fleetwood
sat
and
thought
for
full
five
minutes
of
how
unfortunate
it
was
that
charles
should
have
spoiled
her
evening
plan
for
his
benefit
and
having
no
other
scheme
for
making
people
happy
in
her
own
way
at
the
moment
she
might
have
gone
on
for
five
or
even
ten
minutes
more
had
she
not
been
interrupted
by
a
visit
from
her
brother
well
that
is
the
most
unfortunate
thing
in
the
world
exclaimed
the
poor
lady
as
soon
as
she
saw
scriven
face
charles
has
just
this
moment
gone
into
the
city
to
call
upon
you
humph
said
scriven
i
wonder
he
did
not
call
upon
me
last
night
i
dare
say
he
was
tired
poor
fellow
replied
lady
fleetwood
who
had
almost
always
an
excuse
ready
for
everybody
but
he
sent
the
first
thing
this
morning
to
see
if
you
were
at
home
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
come
himself
rejoined
scriven
drily
then
he
might
have
discovered
that
i
was
not
ten
doors
off
and
would
return
directly
now
i
suppose
he
will
call
at
the
and
finding
i
have
not
arrived
walk
away
again
i
must
see
him
margaret
i
have
some
important
matters
to
tell
him
if
he
comes
back
then
keep
him
to
dinner
and
i
will
come
in
and
join
you
i
can
not
do
that
answered
lady
fleetwood
for
he
has
just
told
me
that
he
is
going
down
to
frimley
common
at
three
what
for
asked
scriven
with
a
look
of
surprise
lady
fleetwood
hesitated
and
her
brother
face
assumed
a
stern
look
is
he
going
to
fight
a
duel
asked
scriven
and
his
poor
sister
in
a
fright
lest
she
should
produce
a
wrong
impression
poured
forth
the
whole
story
of
miss
hayley
and
charles
marston
intentions
and
winkworth
kindness
in
going
with
him
moreover
one
part
of
the
tale
requiring
in
her
estimation
explanation
by
another
she
went
on
to
give
sundry
portions
of
her
conversation
with
her
nephew
to
account
for
his
determination
to
take
care
of
poor
miss
hayley
which
she
well
knew
in
its
bald
state
scriven
would
think
very
absurd
romantic
and
extravagant
and
she
added
various
hints
with
regard
to
what
she
and
charles
judged
he
scriven
ought
to
do
for
the
poor
lady
adding
that
some
people
thought
the
hayleys
had
not
been
altogether
well
treated
there
was
a
sort
of
consciousness
in
her
heart
all
the
time
that
she
was
blundering
which
only
made
her
flounder
more
and
more
amongst
the
shallows
into
which
she
had
plunged
and
the
deep
imperturbable
silence
with
which
her
brother
sat
and
listened
to
a
long
story
a
thing
he
was
rarely
inclined
to
do
only
added
to
her
embarrassment
when
she
had
done
he
asked
no
questions
but
only
raised
his
eyes
to
the
timepiece
and
with
a
last
convulsion
to
get
right
again
or
at
least
to
cast
the
weight
from
her
own
shoulders
she
added
well
henry
i
do
not
understand
all
these
matters
as
you
well
know
perfectly
well
rejoined
scriven
and
so
she
continued
you
had
better
talk
with
charles
about
them
yourself
i
will
said
scriven
he
will
be
back
from
the
city
before
two
added
lady
fleetwood
and
he
sets
out
for
frimley
at
three
ha
said
scriven
and
now
margaret
i
will
go
for
i
do
not
see
anything
further
that
can
be
gained
by
staying
here
now
lady
fleetwood
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
have
unloosed
his
taciturn
tongue
and
discovered
what
he
was
going
to
do
next
but
scriven
was
not
inclined
that
it
should
be
so
and
took
his
departure
he
had
a
brown
cabriolet
at
the
door
that
was
an
age
of
cabriolets
and
when
he
had
got
into
the
vehicle
he
first
turned
his
head
as
if
he
would
have
driven
as
usual
to
his
house
of
business
in
the
city
but
by
the
time
he
had
got
to
the
other
side
of
the
square
he
had
altered
his
mind
and
sweeping
round
with
a
whirl
he
directed
his
course
back
to
his
private
residence
it
was
very
strange
that
he
should
do
so
for
scriven
was
the
most
methodical
of
men
he
arranged
in
the
morning
all
that
he
intended
to
do
during
the
day
and
on
all
ordinary
occasions
he
did
it
but
there
was
something
stranger
still
for
notwithstanding
his
having
told
lady
fleetwood
that
he
must
and
would
see
his
nephew
charles
that
day
he
took
a
very
good
way
of
preventing
himself
from
so
doing
he
first
looked
into
a
then
ordered
one
of
his
servants
to
go
to
the
and
say
that
he
should
not
be
there
till
the
next
morning
and
then
directed
another
servant
to
order
a
pair
of
as
soon
as
they
arrived
he
went
out
of
town
chapter
xiii
with
his
arm
linked
in
that
of
charles
marston
winkworth
such
as
i
have
described
him
walked
on
towards
the
city
and
much
did
he
seem
to
marvel
at
all
he
saw
by
the
way
it
was
not
indeed
that
he
was
unacquainted
with
london
but
cities
as
well
as
people
change
their
dress
only
with
this
difference
that
they
very
often
grow
smarter
as
they
grow
older
the
new
garb
of
his
old
friend
however
was
apparently
not
at
all
to
winkworth
taste
he
commented
on
all
he
saw
with
splenetic
causticity
declaring
that
the
good
old
brick
houses
of
swallow
street
with
their
plain
brown
faces
were
infinitely
preferable
to
the
edifices
of
regent
street
and
waterloo
place
which
he
pronounced
an
insult
to
architecture
and
a
of
every
sort
of
enormity
then
again
the
macadamised
streets
excited
his
indignation
they
had
not
yet
been
paved
with
wood
or
heaven
knows
what
he
would
have
said
of
them
but
as
they
were
he
declared
that
their
sole
object
must
be
to
wet
the
feet
and
splash
the
apparel
of
the
lieges
of
the
land
my
dear
sir
he
said
this
is
true
modern
reform
and
improvement
it
is
a
good
specimen
of
the
customs
and
legislation
of
the
age
everything
that
the
wisdom
of
ten
or
twelve
centuries
and
the
experience
of
whole
races
of
men
have
devised
and
pronounced
good
is
swept
away
knocked
down
chopped
up
simply
for
the
sake
of
change
and
to
show
that
we
are
wiser
than
our
ancestors
in
my
young
days
these
good
streets
of
london
were
paved
with
large
firm
solid
lumps
of
granite
you
could
step
across
from
stone
to
stone
quietly
easily
and
drily
they
wanted
little
or
no
repair
except
when
some
villanous
water
company
chose
to
pick
up
the
stones
in
order
either
to
carry
a
pipe
to
or
cut
it
off
from
some
of
the
adjacent
houses
if
you
ever
come
to
drive
a
cab
or
a
curricle
through
the
streets
winkworth
said
charles
marston
you
will
find
it
much
more
pleasant
to
roll
over
macadam
than
over
those
same
jolting
blocks
of
granite
you
talk
of
heaven
forbid
that
i
ever
should
commit
such
a
mad
action
replied
the
old
gentleman
still
striding
on
with
his
long
legs
and
his
somewhat
rounded
body
and
shoulders
not
at
all
unlike
a
in
the
moulting
season
but
that
which
strikes
me
as
the
most
curious
part
of
the
whole
process
is
that
you
people
of
the
present
day
think
you
are
advancing
all
the
time
and
call
your
operations
progress
when
in
fact
like
the
crab
you
are
going
backwards
here
you
have
very
nearly
reduced
the
streets
of
london
to
the
same
state
in
which
they
were
left
by
king
lud
whose
name
very
appropriately
rhymes
to
mud
i
suppose
all
things
do
go
in
a
circle
answered
charles
marston
like
that
wheel
which
you
see
turning
round
yet
the
wheel
in
turning
round
rolls
the
carriage
forward
and
so
i
suppose
the
gyrations
of
society
help
on
the
great
machine
as
bad
an
illustration
as
ever
was
given
exclaimed
winkworth
one
which
would
break
down
at
the
first
turn
good
heaven
what
a
quantity
of
you
must
admit
that
that
is
at
all
events
a
great
improvement
rejoined
the
younger
gentleman
compared
with
the
small
dingy
panes
which
even
i
can
recollect
you
can
have
nothing
to
say
against
the
i
think
a
whole
volume
said
winkworth
in
the
first
place
the
shops
and
houses
must
be
as
hot
as
this
window
lets
the
whole
sun
in
you
forget
you
are
not
in
india
in
arabia
or
on
the
shores
of
the
red
sea
replied
his
companion
but
what
more
in
the
next
place
continued
winkworth
every
urchin
discontented
snob
or
butcher
boy
with
a
tray
on
his
shoulder
has
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
at
his
mercy
a
falling
a
overturning
or
almost
any
other
accident
you
please
can
pick
your
pocket
of
much
more
than
it
may
be
convenient
to
lose
in
the
shape
of
glass
then
look
at
that
jeweller
shop
think
what
a
temptation
it
must
be
to
a
poor
rogue
to
pop
his
hand
through
and
seize
all
those
diamonds
and
pearls
upon
my
life
it
is
worth
the
risk
of
transportation
then
again
as
a
matter
of
calculation
my
dear
lad
i
do
know
what
is
the
price
of
now
but
i
am
very
sure
that
three
or
four
thousand
pounds
would
not
buy
the
of
that
mercer
who
pays
for
it
sir
who
pays
for
it
why
you
and
i
and
everybody
who
wants
a
silk
handkerchief
a
dozen
of
gloves
or
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
now
what
i
want
is
a
silk
handkerchief
not
and
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
be
obliged
to
contribute
my
quota
to
enable
harry
thompson
or
john
jenkins
or
any
one
else
to
cover
his
wares
with
a
plate
of
stuff
only
fit
for
a
as
dear
as
gold
and
as
frail
as
a
dancing
girl
charles
marston
laughed
outright
that
last
part
of
your
speech
my
dear
winkworth
he
said
is
worthy
of
my
uncle
scriven
then
he
must
be
a
wiser
man
than
you
seem
to
think
him
rejoined
winkworth
with
a
smile
i
never
said
he
was
not
wise
replied
charles
marston
oh
no
he
is
a
very
wise
man
in
his
generation
neither
do
i
think
he
would
carry
the
matter
as
far
as
you
do
nor
object
to
any
one
but
himself
buying
as
much
as
he
pleases
perfectly
certain
that
if
he
scriven
is
obliged
to
pay
something
additional
in
his
bill
on
account
of
that
commodity
he
will
find
means
to
make
the
possessor
pay
him
back
with
interest
if
they
have
any
further
dealings
together
loving
nephew
said
winkworth
drily
pray
are
you
as
affectionately
fond
of
all
your
other
relations
nay
that
is
hardly
fair
replied
charles
marston
you
know
quite
well
winkworth
how
dearly
i
love
my
good
aunt
fleetwood
and
my
noble
father
but
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
that
it
is
the
contrast
between
his
conduct
feelings
and
thoughts
and
those
of
my
good
calculating
uncle
which
makes
the
society
of
the
latter
so
very
unpleasant
to
me
it
is
all
prejudice
i
dare
say
answered
winkworth
in
a
morose
tone
you
love
your
father
doubtless
because
it
is
customary
piety
piety
you
know
marston
it
would
never
do
not
to
love
father
and
then
you
hate
your
uncle
because
he
has
got
the
of
you
you
are
very
much
mistaken
replied
charles
marston
sharply
my
uncle
has
not
the
of
me
in
any
way
thanks
to
my
generosity
and
confidence
i
am
as
independent
of
him
as
of
that
humph
said
the
old
man
but
what
has
your
uncle
done
why
nothing
perhaps
that
the
world
would
blame
answered
charles
but
nothing
that
i
ever
heard
of
that
any
man
of
heart
and
mind
would
praise
in
that
very
business
of
the
poor
hayleys
which
i
was
telling
you
about
last
night
he
persecuted
henry
in
the
most
relentless
manner
the
bankers
who
lost
the
money
and
were
the
real
parties
interested
did
not
show
half
the
eagerness
after
the
poor
blood
that
might
proceed
in
your
uncle
from
a
natural
love
of
justice
said
winkworth
pooh
exclaimed
charles
marston
with
an
impatient
look
did
he
pay
the
bankers
the
money
demanded
his
companion
not
one
penny
rejoined
charles
but
let
us
get
into
some
sort
of
vehicle
or
we
shall
never
arrive
at
the
city
and
calling
one
of
the
street
conveyances
they
proceeded
on
their
way
as
the
reader
is
already
aware
charles
marston
did
not
find
his
uncle
at
his
and
having
nothing
further
to
detain
him
in
a
place
which
he
abhorred
he
drove
back
again
at
once
to
his
house
leaving
winkworth
to
finish
his
business
in
the
great
centre
of
the
world
commerce
and
rejoin
him
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
charles
marston
found
lady
fleetwood
already
well
tenanted
his
cousin
maria
had
arrived
earlier
than
she
had
been
expected
not
ten
minutes
after
her
appearance
lady
anne
mellent
had
presented
herself
and
she
was
followed
closely
by
colonel
middleton
a
crowd
of
gratulations
and
welcomes
poured
warmly
upon
charles
it
is
at
such
first
meetings
after
long
absence
that
to
the
eyes
of
the
observant
and
experienced
in
human
character
the
feelings
of
the
heart
peep
out
in
little
traits
had
the
eyes
of
lady
fleetwood
been
of
any
great
use
to
her
she
would
have
seen
the
ruin
and
destruction
of
one
of
her
favourite
schemes
upon
the
cheek
of
maria
monkton
and
in
the
eyes
of
lady
anne
mellent
the
former
was
nearest
to
the
door
by
which
charles
entered
she
received
him
with
every
appearance
of
affection
returned
his
embrace
warmly
and
expressed
with
no
lack
of
tenderness
the
pleasure
she
felt
at
seeing
him
again
but
not
the
slightest
change
of
colour
in
the
cheek
betrayed
any
deeper
emotion
no
quivering
of
the
lip
no
trembling
of
the
frame
showed
the
agitation
inseparable
from
love
not
so
lady
anne
mellent
she
sat
still
as
stone
while
charles
was
welcomed
by
his
cousin
but
a
ray
of
joyful
light
bright
and
pure
and
radiant
poured
forth
from
her
eyes
while
her
cheek
became
very
pale
and
her
lips
parted
with
a
sigh
that
would
not
be
suppressed
she
was
evidently
a
great
deal
agitated
but
with
a
degree
of
command
over
herself
which
circumstances
rendered
more
habitual
with
her
than
people
generally
believed
she
overcame
the
emotion
in
a
moment
and
by
the
time
the
greeting
of
maria
was
over
she
was
quite
prepared
to
resume
the
gay
and
sparkling
levity
with
which
she
often
covered
deeper
feelings
do
not
come
near
me
charles
marston
she
said
as
the
young
traveller
approached
i
am
determined
not
to
speak
to
you
i
cast
you
off
i
abandon
you
if
i
were
a
rich
grandfather
i
would
cut
you
off
with
a
shilling
but
at
the
same
time
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
it
trembled
as
he
took
it
did
you
not
promise
to
write
to
me
continually
she
asked
and
to
tell
me
all
your
adventures
for
i
was
quite
sure
you
would
get
into
all
sorts
of
scrapes
and
be
delightfully
near
losing
your
life
a
hundred
times
and
now
tell
me
sir
have
you
written
me
a
single
word
for
six
months
i
wrote
you
two
long
letters
the
last
not
three
months
ago
replied
charles
marston
and
you
never
condescended
to
answer
either
because
i
never
received
them
replied
lady
anne
but
you
will
lay
it
all
upon
postmasters
of
course
you
shall
see
the
record
and
the
dates
in
my
journal
little
infidel
said
charles
marston
in
a
low
tone
and
then
added
aloud
but
i
did
even
more
than
all
this
i
was
impudent
enough
to
write
to
your
merry
old
guardian
sir
thomas
wickham
to
ask
him
for
your
address
and
what
did
he
say
what
did
he
say
exclaimed
lady
anne
laughing
something
very
funny
i
am
sure
he
told
me
that
he
was
not
an
astronomer
replied
charles
marston
and
could
not
at
all
calculate
the
transit
of
venus
adding
in
less
figurative
language
that
he
could
not
tell
where
you
might
happen
to
be
as
he
had
never
known
for
two
hours
consecutively
in
his
life
but
that
if
he
might
venture
a
supposition
your
ladyship
was
probably
looking
for
me
somewhere
in
palestine
or
crim
tartary
my
ladyship
was
doing
nothing
of
the
kind
answered
lady
anne
but
there
is
colonel
middleton
exceedingly
anxious
to
say
civil
things
to
you
while
i
should
say
nothing
but
what
is
uncivil
at
least
till
you
have
done
penance
so
go
and
speak
to
him
the
greeting
between
the
two
friends
was
very
warm
and
while
it
took
place
lady
anne
eyes
were
fixed
upon
charles
marston
countenance
with
a
keen
and
scrutinizing
glance
as
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
are
of
course
in
the
bosom
of
him
who
writes
their
history
i
may
very
well
aver
that
lady
anne
was
anxious
to
discover
whether
charles
marston
was
really
as
unconscious
of
the
identity
of
colonel
middleton
and
henry
hayley
as
he
appeared
to
be
but
there
was
nothing
in
any
part
of
his
demeanour
which
could
induce
her
to
suppose
that
he
entertained
even
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
these
men
are
strange
beings
she
said
to
herself
as
she
gazed
here
are
two
girls
who
discover
a
fact
at
once
and
an
old
woman
who
becomes
very
much
puzzled
and
very
doubtful
evidently
for
beloved
aunt
fleetwood
is
clearly
on
thorns
at
this
very
moment
with
doubt
and
curiosity
and
yet
quick
too
rapid
charles
marston
jumps
over
the
truth
and
lights
a
hundred
yards
beyond
upon
my
life
i
think
women
are
creatures
of
instinct
more
than
anything
else
although
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
a
compliment
to
their
understanding
to
suppose
they
share
a
gift
peculiarly
characteristic
of
beasts
the
welcome
was
succeeded
by
general
conversation
and
general
conversation
being
the
most
tedious
thing
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
to
all
but
the
persons
engaged
in
it
and
very
often
to
them
likewise
there
can
be
no
necessity
for
repeating
it
here
though
the
sweetest
tempered
woman
in
the
world
lady
fleetwood
was
in
a
mood
for
fretting
herself
and
to
say
the
truth
circumstances
wonderfully
assisted
her
in
the
first
place
she
was
evidently
one
too
many
the
party
divided
itself
naturally
into
a
quadrille
without
her
but
it
divided
itself
not
according
to
her
taste
had
charles
marston
attached
himself
to
the
side
of
his
cousin
and
his
friend
colonel
middleton
devoted
all
his
attention
to
lady
anne
she
would
have
borne
the
awkward
fact
of
her
own
superfluity
with
the
utmost
meekness
and
patience
but
very
perversely
they
chose
to
do
quite
the
reverse
of
all
this
charles
in
the
window
carried
on
with
lady
anne
mellent
what
seemed
to
his
good
aunt
a
regular
flirtation
while
maria
was
left
entirely
to
the
attentions
of
colonel
middleton
still
as
the
reader
may
suppose
no
four
persons
could
have
been
more
perfectly
contented
with
their
position
than
these
four
could
lady
fleetwood
have
been
contented
to
let
them
alone
and
not
tried
to
arrange
matters
better
but
she
first
joined
in
the
conversation
of
one
party
and
then
interrupted
that
of
another
taking
care
to
choose
the
exact
moment
when
something
of
importance
was
to
be
said
or
some
word
of
affection
to
be
spoken
which
was
most
willing
to
hide
itself
from
listening
ears
at
length
however
winkworth
was
announced
and
the
arrival
of
a
stranger
put
out
all
the
former
combinations
advancing
into
the
room
with
one
hand
behind
his
back
and
his
hat
in
the
other
he
made
a
formal
sliding
bow
all
round
till
his
eye
rested
upon
charles
marston
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
the
latter
advanced
to
introduce
him
to
the
rest
though
gay
frank
and
bluff
as
we
have
seen
where
he
was
intimate
winkworth
was
clearly
very
formal
and
ceremonial
amongst
strangers
but
yet
there
was
a
certain
degree
of
courteousness
in
his
manner
which
perfectly
suited
the
notions
of
lady
fleetwood
the
very
scrape
of
his
left
foot
upon
the
carpet
as
he
made
his
exceedingly
decided
bow
and
the
little
expletives
with
which
he
seasoned
his
replies
savoured
of
that
dignified
stateliness
which
even
within
her
own
memory
was
the
distinctive
quality
of
the
old
court
you
have
been
a
long
time
in
india
i
think
winkworth
she
said
looking
rather
too
curiously
at
his
sallow
complexion
madam
i
fear
it
is
written
on
my
countenance
he
replied
with
another
low
bow
but
i
have
as
you
say
been
a
good
deal
in
india
and
i
learn
from
your
nephew
that
my
old
friend
marston
is
your
lady
fleetwood
was
delighted
to
hear
that
winkworth
was
an
old
friend
of
her
sister
maria
husband
and
she
soon
engaged
her
visiter
in
giving
her
a
full
statement
of
all
he
knew
concerning
marston
in
india
which
was
certainly
well
calculated
to
be
gratifying
to
her
ears
it
proved
also
a
seasonable
diversion
in
favour
of
the
lovers
in
the
other
part
of
the
room
for
it
occupied
all
the
excellent
attention
and
prevented
her
from
attempting
to
make
them
comfortable
the
announcement
that
charles
marston
carriage
was
at
the
door
about
ten
minutes
after
his
companion
first
appearance
put
an
end
to
the
explanations
he
was
giving
to
lady
anne
and
the
two
gentlemen
departed
upon
their
charitable
expedition
leaving
henry
still
by
maria
side
one
gentleman
amongst
three
ladies
is
but
small
provision
but
colonel
middleton
seemed
in
no
degree
inclined
to
depart
and
for
a
minute
or
two
lady
anne
was
kind
enough
to
make
a
diversion
in
his
favour
by
going
over
and
occupying
the
attention
of
lady
fleetwood
how
maria
and
he
took
advantage
of
this
movement
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
certain
it
is
they
talked
in
a
very
low
voice
for
some
minutes
till
lady
anne
suddenly
rose
as
if
to
depart
and
then
maria
took
a
liberty
with
her
aunt
house
which
she
would
have
done
without
the
slightest
hesitation
where
no
deep
feelings
were
concerned
but
which
now
from
some
cause
or
another
called
the
colour
somewhat
warmly
into
her
cheek
saying
aloud
will
you
not
dine
with
us
colonel
middleton
my
aunt
i
am
sure
will
be
very
happy
to
see
you
before
henry
could
answer
or
the
little
sort
of
agitated
consideration
of
and
which
seized
upon
lady
fleetwood
could
resolve
itself
into
anything
like
form
and
shape
lady
anne
held
up
her
finger
exclaiming
remember
you
are
engaged
to
me
sir
for
at
least
i
will
give
you
up
to
lady
fleetwood
with
all
my
heart
maria
certainly
did
think
her
young
friend
very
strange
and
perhaps
felt
a
little
mortified
it
was
but
a
transitory
emotion
however
but
it
was
sufficiently
strong
to
cause
henry
answer
to
escape
her
and
the
next
moment
while
he
had
turned
to
lady
fleetwood
to
answer
with
thanks
the
invitation
which
she
cordially
seconded
the
moment
it
was
declined
lady
anne
crossing
the
room
laid
her
hand
upon
arm
saying
in
a
whisper
trust
me
dear
girl
trust
me
i
am
neither
a
flirt
nor
a
coquette
whatever
you
may
think
indeed
i
think
you
neither
anne
though
perhaps
a
little
strange
maria
monkton
replied
and
with
a
gay
laugh
and
a
nod
of
her
head
lady
anne
mellent
ran
out
of
the
room
leaving
henry
with
maria
and
lady
fleetwood
there
we
also
must
leave
him
dear
reader
for
the
time
to
follow
charles
down
to
frimley
and
though
the
journey
was
not
a
very
long
one
and
the
stages
were
short
and
easy
even
in
those
days
merely
from
london
to
hounslow
from
hounslow
to
egham
from
egham
to
bagshot
and
from
bagshot
to
frimley
passing
by
the
golden
farmer
and
stopping
at
the
white
hart
i
should
undoubtedly
abridge
the
way
by
stepping
over
the
whole
country
after
the
fashion
of
the
pair
of
compasses
with
which
one
measures
distances
on
a
map
were
it
not
for
one
peculiarity
which
must
be
pointed
out
the
old
road
to
southampton
and
a
great
many
other
places
for
some
distance
beyond
frimley
runs
only
through
two
counties
and
those
metropolitan
counties
too
first
middlesex
and
then
surrey
and
yet
perhaps
were
you
to
look
for
any
thirty
miles
throughout
all
england
which
comprise
more
waste
land
than
any
other
thirty
miles
you
would
have
to
pitch
upon
these
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
capital
only
take
the
names
i
have
given
above
and
add
the
word
heath
or
common
to
them
and
you
have
at
least
fifteen
miles
of
waste
out
of
the
thirty
hounslow
heath
egham
heath
bagshot
heath
frimley
common
over
all
these
they
rolled
as
fast
as
two
good
horses
and
a
gay
postilion
could
manage
to
make
them
and
about
six
they
reached
the
spot
where
they
had
seen
poor
rebecca
hayley
two
nights
before
the
carriage
was
stopped
and
out
they
got
as
near
the
hovel
as
possible
and
then
wandering
down
the
little
path
by
the
side
of
the
swampy
stream
smothered
with
moss
they
made
their
way
to
the
door
it
was
closed
but
not
locked
and
charles
marston
without
the
ceremony
of
knocking
lifted
the
latch
and
went
in
there
was
but
one
tenant
in
the
place
and
that
was
the
boy
jim
but
the
poor
fellow
face
and
manner
no
more
displayed
that
calm
patient
steadfast
opposition
to
adversity
and
sorrow
which
they
had
so
lately
shown
he
sat
by
the
fireless
hearth
and
wept
why
what
is
the
matter
my
lad
asked
charles
and
where
is
your
old
friend
bessy
they
have
taken
her
away
replied
the
boy
and
i
am
left
here
alone
taken
her
away
taken
her
away
said
winkworth
following
his
young
friend
who
took
her
away
if
your
story
charles
be
quite
correct
i
do
not
see
who
can
have
any
right
to
take
her
away
who
was
it
took
her
away
jim
oh
he
had
right
enough
i
dare
say
answered
the
boy
at
least
he
seemed
to
have
for
he
ordered
about
him
quite
free
and
the
people
did
just
what
he
liked
and
when
i
asked
him
what
was
to
become
of
me
he
said
might
happen
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
he
would
have
been
more
civil
i
think
if
he
had
had
no
right
i
ca
tell
that
replied
winkworth
who
was
occasionally
given
to
moralise
as
the
reader
may
have
perceived
wrong
is
often
a
very
uncivil
thing
but
what
was
he
like
was
he
an
old
man
or
a
young
one
younger
than
you
are
a
good
bit
replied
the
boy
but
older
than
he
is
a
good
bit
and
he
pointed
to
charles
marston
further
questions
elicited
that
the
person
who
had
carried
away
poor
miss
hayley
was
a
gentleman
between
forty
and
fifty
years
of
age
tall
and
thin
with
grey
hair
but
no
whiskers
he
had
come
down
in
a
carriage
the
boy
said
having
a
servant
with
him
and
together
they
had
put
poor
bessy
into
the
vehicle
whether
she
would
or
not
she
seemed
to
know
him
however
he
added
and
called
him
by
his
name
and
was
very
much
afraid
of
him
she
cried
and
sobbed
very
much
too
in
answer
to
another
question
the
lad
stated
that
he
had
forgotten
the
name
which
his
poor
old
friend
had
given
to
the
gentleman
the
description
is
uncommonly
like
my
uncle
scriven
said
charles
marston
that
it
that
it
cried
the
boy
eagerly
that
is
what
she
called
him
i
remember
now
i
swear
that
my
aunt
fleetwood
has
been
at
the
bottom
of
this
said
charles
with
her
excellent
intentions
answer
for
it
she
has
told
my
uncle
all
about
our
having
found
the
poor
old
lady
here
and
tried
to
persuade
him
to
do
something
for
her
thus
he
has
learnt
all
about
it
and
for
some
reason
of
his
own
has
come
and
carried
her
away
but
i
will
have
this
affair
investigated
to
the
bottom
quite
right
my
dear
boy
if
you
do
not
run
your
head
against
sundry
stone
walls
in
so
doing
replied
winkworth
but
you
should
always
remember
charles
marston
that
you
have
got
brains
and
that
stone
walls
have
none
so
that
it
is
not
a
fair
fight
between
you
and
them
however
now
let
us
think
of
the
boy
oh
i
will
take
him
into
my
service
replied
the
younger
man
and
put
him
under
my
fellow
to
teach
him
all
manner
of
wickedness
said
winkworth
and
therefore
you
shall
do
no
such
thing
i
will
take
him
into
mine
where
there
no
blackguard
with
long
whiskers
to
corrupt
him
i
drill
him
into
all
the
precise
notions
of
an
old
bachelor
service
and
when
he
fit
for
that
he
fit
for
anything
would
you
like
to
come
and
live
with
me
my
good
boy
and
be
my
servant
and
the
old
gentleman
yellow
countenance
lighted
up
with
a
benevolent
smile
which
made
it
look
quite
handsome
i
should
like
it
very
much
said
the
boy
eagerly
and
then
perhaps
i
can
sometimes
see
bessy
i
dare
say
you
can
though
i
know
not
why
you
call
her
bessy
answered
winkworth
at
all
events
i
will
not
prevent
you
good
heaven
my
dear
charles
how
much
happier
and
brighter
and
better
a
world
it
would
be
if
we
all
continued
to
love
our
bessies
through
life
as
this
poor
boy
seems
to
love
his
there
do
not
stare
so
i
mean
by
bessies
the
best
friends
of
our
youth
not
perhaps
the
mere
corporeal
friends
but
the
pure
ingenuous
candour
of
early
years
which
would
be
a
better
friend
to
man
if
he
did
but
cling
to
it
with
affection
through
life
than
all
the
worldly
friends
we
gain
in
passing
through
existence
shrewdness
caution
prudence
selfishness
wit
or
even
wisdom
but
it
is
no
use
in
trying
to
indoctrinate
you
i
see
you
only
laugh
at
all
my
most
beautiful
illustrations
and
think
me
the
most
foolish
old
man
in
the
world
not
i
indeed
my
dear
sir
replied
charles
marston
i
should
only
like
some
day
to
put
your
sarcasms
when
your
spleen
is
moved
and
your
fine
sentiments
when
your
enthusiasm
is
excited
side
by
side
in
double
columns
as
they
print
books
and
see
how
they
would
look
when
compared
they
would
mutually
balance
each
other
and
so
come
to
nothing
said
the
old
gentleman
but
now
my
good
boy
jim
what
is
your
name
besides
jim
brown
replied
the
boy
i
thought
so
exclaimed
winkworth
i
could
have
sworn
it
jim
always
precedes
brown
and
brown
always
follows
jim
it
is
a
natural
collocation
how
strange
it
is
charles
marston
that
particular
names
have
such
strange
affinities
for
each
other
so
that
they
appear
to
unite
by
the
mere
attraction
of
cohesion
how
extraordinary
that
this
boy
godfathers
and
godmothers
without
any
preconcerted
consideration
of
the
subject
were
driven
by
a
sort
of
inevitable
necessity
to
call
him
jim
they
had
indeed
but
one
alternative
and
that
was
tom
however
tom
is
less
dignified
being
frequently
attached
to
cat
and
now
jim
brown
to
proceed
to
business
you
shall
either
have
your
choice
of
getting
into
the
dickey
of
that
carriage
and
coming
up
with
me
to
town
to
be
fed
lodged
receive
twenty
pounds
and
wait
upon
an
old
gentleman
with
a
yellow
face
or
you
shall
stay
here
for
a
day
or
two
longer
to
put
your
little
affairs
in
order
and
follow
me
up
to
town
for
the
same
purposes
the
boy
had
listened
with
profound
attention
to
comments
on
his
name
though
with
a
slight
expression
of
wonder
on
his
face
but
not
of
stupid
wonder
to
his
proposal
he
gave
not
less
attention
and
then
thought
for
a
moment
before
he
answered
poor
boy
he
had
been
early
taught
to
think
for
circumstance
is
a
hard
master
and
often
teaches
severe
lessons
to
youth
only
fitted
for
age
i
think
i
would
rather
stay
for
a
day
he
replied
at
length
for
there
are
some
things
of
my
poor
mother
which
i
should
like
to
pack
up
and
not
have
wasted
well
then
there
is
a
guinea
for
you
to
pay
your
journey
up
on
the
top
of
the
coach
said
winkworth
and
now
have
you
got
such
a
thing
as
a
pen
that
i
may
write
down
my
address
in
london
here
poor
bessy
pen
said
the
boy
which
she
used
to
teach
me
to
write
with
while
with
the
stump
a
drop
of
ink
in
a
little
phial
and
a
scrap
of
somewhat
dirty
paper
winkworth
wrote
down
his
address
in
london
charles
marston
gazed
out
of
the
upon
the
heath
over
which
the
purple
shades
of
evening
were
falling
fast
who
are
all
those
people
passing
across
the
common
asked
charles
marston
turning
to
the
boy
is
there
any
great
work
going
on
here
oh
no
sir
replied
jim
those
are
people
i
dare
say
from
the
great
meeting
to
petition
for
a
reform
in
parliament
which
was
to
be
held
farther
up
on
the
common
the
men
were
coming
down
all
the
morning
and
a
bad
set
they
were
too
for
they
walked
straight
through
william
small
garden
trampled
down
all
his
beds
and
gathered
all
the
flowers
he
said
they
were
nothing
but
a
set
of
thieves
and
pickpockets
from
london
and
they
have
done
him
damage
for
twenty
pounds
or
more
ha
charles
that
bad
said
winkworth
rising
and
folding
up
the
paper
on
which
he
had
written
the
address
we
had
better
get
away
before
the
shades
of
night
are
upon
us
i
hope
your
whiskerandos
has
got
the
pistols
with
him
i
dare
say
he
has
replied
charles
marston
and
after
a
few
words
more
exchanged
with
the
boy
they
left
the
cottage
and
got
into
their
carriage
again
winkworth
however
seemed
to
have
thought
better
of
his
plan
of
operations
especially
when
they
got
into
the
midst
of
a
noisy
and
somewhat
turbulent
crowd
one
worthy
member
of
which
amused
himself
by
throwing
a
stone
at
the
head
of
the
servant
after
all
said
the
old
gentleman
i
think
it
will
be
better
to
stop
and
dine
and
let
these
admirable
reformers
disperse
charles
marston
was
very
willing
to
do
anything
that
he
liked
for
to
say
the
truth
his
mind
was
very
busy
and
wanted
to
be
busy
and
as
the
reader
is
well
aware
when
such
is
the
case
the
spiritual
part
cares
very
little
what
the
corporeal
is
about
provided
there
be
no
interruption
to
its
own
operations
they
consequently
drove
to
the
inn
where
they
had
already
stopped
on
their
way
to
town
ordered
dinner
and
according
to
the
usual
process
waited
for
it
and
ate
it
not
exactly
in
silence
for
notwithstanding
all
that
philosophers
can
say
either
mind
or
body
will
often
carry
on
two
operations
at
once
and
charles
talked
of
indifferent
subjects
while
his
mind
was
occupied
with
one
particular
theme
that
is
to
say
he
talked
mechanically
for
conversation
is
much
more
the
effect
of
mere
machinery
than
we
think
now
internally
he
was
occupied
in
considering
what
could
be
the
motives
of
his
uncle
in
the
act
he
had
just
performed
and
he
mingled
therewith
sundry
doubts
hesitations
and
inquiries
with
which
it
is
needless
to
trouble
the
reader
in
a
word
thought
mounted
upon
imagination
went
galloping
away
hither
and
thither
while
the
mechanical
part
of
mind
remained
at
home
taking
care
of
the
house
in
the
mean
time
there
was
a
good
deal
of
noise
and
bustle
in
the
inn
which
on
their
first
visit
had
seemed
as
quiet
a
little
place
as
any
at
which
hungry
travellers
ever
ate
chickens
or
tough
beefsteaks
and
the
landlord
thought
fit
to
inform
his
respected
guests
in
an
apologetic
tone
that
there
were
several
of
the
orators
of
the
great
meeting
just
dispersed
the
of
that
day
then
dining
in
the
house
and
several
of
their
admirers
waiting
in
the
yard
to
cheer
them
as
they
went
home
now
it
is
very
natural
for
orators
to
be
noisy
first
because
the
unruly
member
is
their
spoilt
child
and
next
because
at
least
i
never
yet
saw
met
with
or
heard
of
one
of
them
with
whom
such
was
not
the
case
they
never
consider
any
others
than
themselves
winkworth
and
charles
marston
then
were
not
the
least
surprised
at
the
inn
being
noisy
under
such
circumstances
and
the
only
effect
was
that
they
hurried
their
dinner
in
order
to
get
out
of
it
as
soon
as
possible
whenever
the
meal
was
concluded
the
horses
were
put
to
the
lamps
lighted
for
it
was
now
quite
dark
crack
went
the
whip
round
went
the
wheels
and
off
went
the
carriage
through
the
little
town
they
drove
quietly
and
easily
enough
and
for
some
distance
beyond
it
but
at
length
awful
bagshot
heath
spread
around
them
true
it
might
have
been
any
other
place
on
the
earth
for
aught
they
knew
the
night
was
cloudy
the
stars
were
all
in
bed
and
fast
asleep
the
moon
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
bagshot
heath
that
night
and
neither
charles
nor
his
companion
had
the
least
idea
that
they
were
in
the
midst
of
a
place
notorious
for
robbery
some
ten
years
before
when
a
loud
voice
cried
stop
and
the
carriage
was
brought
to
a
sudden
halt
it
is
probable
that
some
of
the
gentlemen
who
anxious
for
an
extension
of
the
franchise
had
attended
the
meeting
in
the
morning
seeing
a
carriage
indicative
of
wealth
in
the
of
the
inn
had
thought
that
they
might
make
their
day
expedition
serve
two
purposes
and
tend
first
to
the
expansion
of
their
rights
and
liberties
and
secondly
to
a
more
equal
distribution
of
property
at
all
events
some
persons
animated
by
the
latter
object
appealed
to
the
travellers
pistol
in
hand
to
convey
a
portion
of
their
superfluity
to
their
more
needy
the
servant
at
the
back
of
the
carriage
however
produced
a
pair
of
tubes
very
similar
to
those
in
the
hands
of
the
applicants
and
without
much
ceremony
fired
the
shot
was
instantly
returned
but
with
what
effect
charles
marston
did
not
wait
to
see
for
seated
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
carriage
which
was
opposite
to
that
where
the
attack
was
made
he
put
forth
his
hand
the
window
on
that
side
being
down
opened
the
door
jumped
out
and
applied
a
thick
stick
which
he
had
with
him
to
the
head
of
a
gentleman
who
was
holding
the
horses
the
head
was
a
hard
one
and
probably
not
unaccustomed
to
such
calls
to
forbearance
but
the
blow
was
sufficiently
well
directed
and
forcibly
applied
to
stretch
him
for
one
moment
flat
upon
his
back
the
next
instant
he
was
upon
his
feet
again
but
not
willing
to
take
a
second
dose
of
the
same
rude
medicine
and
totally
forgetful
of
his
hat
which
to
say
truth
was
not
worthy
of
great
solicitude
he
ran
off
across
the
heath
as
fast
as
he
could
go
now
running
is
the
most
infectious
of
all
diseases
and
the
two
other
gentlemen
who
were
with
him
were
seized
almost
simultaneously
with
the
same
malady
charles
marston
did
not
think
fit
to
pursue
the
fugitives
but
merely
inquired
of
the
servant
who
had
by
this
time
descended
from
his
leathern
box
whether
the
shot
the
fellows
had
fired
had
hit
him
no
sir
replied
the
man
in
his
peculiar
affected
tone
the
gentlemen
line
of
fire
was
not
well
directed
it
merely
damaged
the
crystal
of
the
carriage
i
think
and
charles
marston
calling
him
a
puppy
in
his
own
mind
went
round
to
the
other
side
got
in
and
ordered
the
postboy
to
drive
on
for
a
moment
or
two
winkworth
was
completely
silent
but
at
length
he
remarked
in
a
low
quiet
tone
well
i
do
think
master
charles
marston
that
i
am
a
very
unfortunate
man
and
that
my
left
shoulder
is
a
very
unfortunate
shoulder
both
being
subject
to
suffer
by
encounters
with
highwaymen
whether
syrian
or
english
mahommedan
or
christian
why
my
dear
sir
you
do
mean
to
say
you
are
wounded
exclaimed
charles
marston
i
do
indeed
replied
winkworth
and
within
one
inch
of
the
spot
where
i
was
wounded
before
luckily
it
is
lower
down
and
on
the
outside
so
it
is
only
in
the
flesh
i
fancy
but
i
am
not
obliged
to
them
nevertheless
i
was
just
stooping
a
little
forward
to
see
what
was
going
on
when
the
ball
came
crashing
through
the
glass
and
into
my
shoulder
charles
marston
was
now
as
may
well
be
supposed
under
a
good
deal
of
anxiety
for
his
friend
but
winkworth
would
not
consent
to
stop
at
the
next
inn
longer
than
was
necessary
to
ascertain
that
the
bleeding
was
not
great
charles
insisted
upon
putting
on
another
pair
of
horses
to
the
carriage
to
accelerate
their
progress
and
in
about
two
two
hours
and
a
half
they
reached
the
door
of
their
hotel
there
a
surgeon
was
immediately
sent
for
and
after
what
seemed
to
charles
a
very
long
delay
the
man
of
healing
entered
the
room
chapter
xiv
human
life
is
a
strange
thing
consider
it
in
what
way
we
will
strip
it
of
all
factitious
adjuncts
and
leave
it
bare
and
bald
as
a
mere
lease
for
sixty
or
seventy
years
of
sensations
feelings
thoughts
hopes
expectations
still
it
is
strange
very
strange
but
man
has
made
it
stranger
society
has
put
so
many
clauses
into
the
lease
that
the
covenants
are
not
always
easily
fulfilled
and
the
tenancy
occasionally
becomes
troublesome
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
this
was
altogether
the
case
with
worthy
winkworth
that
he
was
rich
was
evident
that
notwithstanding
his
meagre
body
stooping
shoulders
and
yellow
face
he
was
strong
and
in
good
health
his
capability
of
enduring
long
fatigue
and
the
rapidity
with
which
he
had
recovered
from
his
former
wounds
in
syria
proved
sufficiently
but
still
he
seemed
very
indifferent
to
life
and
when
the
surgeon
as
surgeons
often
will
upon
very
slight
occasions
thought
fit
to
look
grave
and
solemn
while
examining
his
wound
the
old
gentleman
turned
laughing
to
charles
marston
and
said
with
a
nod
of
his
head
i
remember
you
in
my
my
dear
sir
he
continued
addressing
the
surgeon
do
not
look
so
serious
you
can
not
frighten
me
i
assure
you
life
in
its
very
best
and
palmiest
state
with
all
its
joys
and
pleasures
unimpaired
is
not
so
valuable
a
commodity
in
my
eyes
as
to
cost
me
two
thoughts
about
losing
it
there
is
no
great
chance
of
that
however
this
time
and
even
if
there
were
this
old
crazy
body
of
which
as
of
a
house
long
in
chancery
there
is
little
more
than
the
framework
left
may
just
as
well
go
down
to
mother
earth
or
as
after
a
few
score
more
morrows
which
will
very
soon
be
passed
the
ball
however
was
soon
extracted
and
the
old
gentleman
retired
to
bed
treating
the
whole
matter
somewhat
lightly
the
next
morning
when
charles
marston
went
to
visit
him
some
degree
of
inflammation
had
naturally
come
on
rendering
him
rather
irritable
of
which
he
was
conscious
go
away
charles
go
away
he
said
go
and
see
your
uncle
as
you
ought
to
have
done
before
now
i
am
cross
and
if
you
stay
you
will
find
me
as
bitter
as
a
black
dose
well
i
shall
tell
my
servant
at
all
events
to
be
in
readiness
to
attend
upon
you
in
case
you
ring
replied
charles
marston
tell
him
to
go
to
the
devil
exclaimed
winkworth
the
whiskered
coxcomb
with
his
airs
and
graces
would
drive
me
mad
in
a
minute
no
no
go
away
and
see
your
uncle
and
leave
me
to
myself
you
may
come
in
about
one
or
two
but
mind
how
you
open
that
door
for
it
makes
such
a
villanous
squeaking
that
one
would
suppose
it
had
not
moved
on
its
hinges
for
there
was
a
house
which
charles
marston
would
undoubtedly
have
much
preferred
to
visit
if
he
had
followed
his
own
inclination
but
nevertheless
with
a
strong
resolution
he
turned
his
steps
towards
his
uncle
dwelling
feeling
conscious
that
he
had
certainly
made
no
great
exertions
to
see
him
since
his
return
he
was
immediately
admitted
for
scriven
seldom
betook
himself
to
his
before
eleven
or
twelve
and
being
a
man
of
very
regular
habits
the
ordinary
process
was
to
read
three
or
four
articles
in
the
morning
papers
before
he
set
out
partly
during
breakfast
and
partly
during
the
first
steps
of
digestion
afterwards
i
have
said
three
or
four
articles
because
in
reading
newspapers
as
in
everything
else
scriven
went
upon
a
system
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
always
have
a
motive
and
his
motive
was
usually
one
and
indivisible
there
was
no
such
thing
as
an
impulse
in
his
nature
he
did
not
recollect
ever
having
had
an
impulse
he
was
babbage
calculating
machine
in
flesh
and
blood
his
sister
lady
fleetwood
had
told
her
nephew
as
we
have
seen
that
scriven
had
been
very
angry
upon
one
occasion
but
lady
fleetwood
made
a
mistake
scriven
was
never
very
angry
it
did
not
come
within
his
calculations
to
be
so
he
could
be
exceedingly
severe
bitter
caustic
and
coolly
regardless
of
other
people
feelings
but
he
was
not
the
least
angry
all
the
while
he
either
wanted
to
prevent
them
from
doing
a
thing
he
did
not
desire
to
be
done
or
to
stop
them
from
ever
doing
it
again
it
was
still
upon
a
motive
thus
in
reading
the
newspaper
he
read
those
articles
alone
which
were
likely
to
affect
himself
personally
either
immediately
or
remotely
he
cared
nothing
about
politics
except
as
the
price
of
the
funds
the
value
of
merchandise
the
risks
of
speculation
or
the
amounts
of
taxation
were
concerned
highway
robberies
murders
suits
in
chancery
police
reports
trials
at
bar
or
in
the
arches
court
interested
him
not
in
the
least
except
as
excepted
they
were
all
about
other
people
and
he
would
have
considered
it
a
want
of
due
economy
to
give
them
the
least
attention
births
deaths
and
marriages
in
the
abstract
he
cared
nothing
about
and
the
whole
world
might
have
been
born
wedded
or
buried
without
producing
one
sensation
in
his
bosom
provided
he
could
have
carried
on
his
transactions
without
them
the
gazette
the
shipping
list
the
money
article
the
commercial
statement
a
few
trials
for
swindling
forgery
and
breach
of
contract
together
with
reports
of
the
budget
the
estimates
and
any
debates
in
parliament
referring
to
commercial
matters
were
all
that
he
ever
thought
of
reading
and
the
lucubrations
of
editors
in
what
are
called
leading
articles
he
passed
over
with
utter
contempt
saying
that
he
trusted
he
could
form
as
good
an
opinion
himself
on
matters
of
fact
as
any
they
could
give
him
the
reader
must
pardon
me
for
dwelling
so
long
on
character
and
i
do
so
not
because
it
is
at
all
a
singular
one
for
it
is
as
common
as
the
air
under
different
modifications
but
because
there
are
very
few
men
who
possessing
the
jewel
of
perfect
selfishness
are
bold
enough
to
display
it
openly
and
without
disguise
to
the
eyes
of
all
men
but
scriven
was
at
the
acme
of
his
class
he
was
as
a
naturalist
would
say
the
most
perfect
specimen
ever
found
and
it
requires
to
be
so
before
selfishness
can
be
considered
a
virtue
and
a
matter
of
pride
when
charles
marston
was
ushered
up
to
his
uncle
he
found
him
busily
reading
an
account
of
the
barque
louisa
having
been
spoken
with
by
the
arcadia
in
latitude
longitude
neither
the
latitude
nor
longitude
signifies
a
pin
to
you
or
me
reader
though
it
did
to
him
scriven
looked
up
over
the
top
of
the
paper
as
his
nephew
was
announced
dropped
it
a
little
lower
when
he
saw
him
and
said
how
do
you
do
charles
how
do
you
do
charles
i
will
speak
to
you
in
a
moment
and
he
read
out
the
without
moving
a
muscle
charles
marston
had
a
great
inclination
to
put
on
his
hat
and
walk
away
for
it
must
be
recollected
that
eighteen
months
had
passed
since
scriven
had
last
seen
his
nephew
and
charles
without
being
angry
at
the
coolness
of
his
reception
argued
in
this
manner
he
does
not
care
to
see
me
i
certainly
do
not
care
to
see
him
why
should
i
be
bored
by
stopping
while
he
reads
the
paper
there
were
two
or
three
other
little
and
in
charles
marston
mind
but
they
were
brought
to
an
end
by
scriven
finishing
the
subject
which
he
was
reading
and
turning
to
his
nephew
with
his
usual
dry
air
well
charles
he
said
here
is
the
third
day
since
you
arrived
in
london
and
i
have
the
honour
of
seeing
you
at
last
charles
marston
did
not
think
fit
to
make
the
slightest
excuse
or
apology
contenting
himself
with
the
simple
facts
of
having
sent
to
his
uncle
house
to
inquire
if
he
were
at
home
and
having
afterwards
called
upon
him
in
the
city
if
you
had
come
yourself
charles
said
his
uncle
the
servant
would
have
told
you
that
i
was
near
at
hand
and
would
be
home
directly
and
if
you
had
thought
fit
to
remain
in
london
till
you
saw
me
yesterday
you
might
have
met
me
at
your
aunt
house
last
night
i
having
gone
there
in
the
hope
of
seeing
you
this
seems
to
me
something
like
an
accusation
answered
charles
a
little
nettled
and
in
regard
to
the
first
count
of
the
indictment
i
must
plead
that
i
could
not
divine
that
your
servants
would
tell
lies
they
assured
mine
that
they
did
not
know
where
you
were
or
when
you
would
return
in
regard
to
the
second
count
i
had
business
which
i
judged
of
importance
to
take
me
out
of
town
and
as
you
knew
i
was
gone
from
dear
aunt
fleetwood
and
was
aware
also
of
the
business
that
took
me
i
could
not
suppose
that
the
expectation
of
meeting
me
among
the
number
of
her
ladyship
guests
would
take
you
to
her
house
had
i
known
it
i
might
have
hurried
my
return
to
london
then
lady
fleetwood
told
you
that
she
had
informed
me
of
your
expedition
said
scriven
in
an
inquiring
tone
but
with
such
perfect
composure
that
it
provoked
his
nephew
not
so
replied
charles
i
divined
it
from
her
usual
conduct
and
felt
sure
of
it
when
i
found
that
you
had
forestalled
me
in
my
object
scriven
remained
silent
for
a
moment
but
then
he
replied
quite
unmoved
your
combinations
are
good
charles
but
sometimes
may
be
mistaken
and
are
always
rather
too
hasty
the
simple
question
is
this
my
dear
uncle
said
charles
did
lady
fleetwood
inform
you
or
not
that
i
had
discovered
poor
miss
hayley
in
very
great
misery
not
far
from
frimley
and
that
i
intended
to
go
down
yesterday
have
her
brought
to
town
and
see
that
she
was
properly
taken
care
of
and
did
you
not
set
off
immediately
and
carry
her
away
to
a
madhouse
who
puts
the
question
asked
scriven
with
his
usual
equable
manner
i
do
answered
charles
rather
respectful
from
a
nephew
to
an
uncle
replied
scriven
drily
and
now
my
dear
charles
to
more
serious
matters
i
wrote
to
you
to
come
over
immediately
as
i
wanted
to
see
you
charles
was
angry
at
the
somewhat
contemptuous
brevity
with
which
his
uncle
dismissed
the
subject
you
will
excuse
me
sir
he
said
but
i
wish
for
an
answer
to
my
question
before
we
enter
upon
any
other
matter
you
shall
have
an
answer
before
you
leave
the
room
replied
scriven
but
i
think
it
necessary
to
proceed
in
order
for
you
know
my
good
nephew
that
i
am
very
methodical
and
as
my
letter
to
you
is
the
first
incident
chronologically
speaking
i
wish
to
deal
with
that
first
very
well
sir
replied
charles
what
might
be
the
occasion
of
your
wishing
my
immediate
return
one
of
some
importance
answered
scriven
you
and
your
cousin
maria
have
been
brought
up
in
habits
of
great
affection
for
each
other
she
is
exceedingly
beautiful
and
her
fortune
very
large
at
her
father
and
mother
death
has
not
as
you
may
well
suppose
diminished
under
my
management
although
she
does
not
go
so
much
into
the
world
as
most
young
women
at
her
time
of
life
yet
there
is
every
day
a
probability
of
some
proposal
being
made
to
her
which
she
may
think
fit
to
accept
now
my
dear
charles
i
would
not
have
you
go
on
wasting
your
time
in
wandering
about
upon
the
continent
and
throw
away
an
opportunity
which
may
never
occur
again
charles
marston
smiled
dear
aunt
fleetwood
has
bit
you
sir
i
think
he
replied
maria
and
i
have
a
great
deal
of
affection
for
each
other
but
it
is
quite
brotherly
and
sisterly
i
can
assure
you
and
will
remain
so
till
the
end
of
our
days
whether
i
am
at
babylon
or
her
neighbour
in
london
i
advise
you
for
what
i
think
the
best
charles
replied
his
uncle
you
are
too
wise
and
have
too
much
knowledge
of
the
world
i
am
sure
to
sacrifice
all
the
important
objects
of
life
for
romance
decidedly
answered
charles
marston
you
must
be
very
well
aware
that
i
have
not
a
particle
of
romance
in
my
disposition
plenty
of
fun
my
dear
uncle
and
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
of
different
kinds
but
none
of
the
kind
called
romance
nevertheless
setting
aside
all
objections
to
marrying
at
all
which
i
suppose
you
are
the
last
man
on
earth
to
undervalue
i
have
an
immense
number
of
sufficient
objections
to
the
important
act
and
deed
of
proposing
to
my
cousin
maria
pray
what
may
they
be
asked
scriven
drily
in
the
first
place
answered
his
nephew
it
would
take
her
quite
by
surprise
and
i
do
not
wish
to
surprise
her
in
the
second
place
she
would
to
a
certainty
refuse
me
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
refused
in
the
third
place
if
she
did
by
some
miracle
accept
me
which
nothing
but
a
miracle
could
produce
we
should
find
out
in
three
weeks
that
we
were
not
suited
to
each
other
and
in
the
but
why
not
suited
to
each
other
demanded
scriven
interrupting
him
after
listening
to
his
objections
with
marvellous
patience
you
have
no
vices
that
i
know
of
though
a
great
many
follies
and
maria
is
the
sweetest
tempered
girl
in
the
world
you
have
touched
the
exact
points
of
difficulty
most
excellent
uncle
replied
charles
marston
maria
is
not
fond
of
follies
and
i
am
not
fond
of
sweets
i
never
was
even
from
childhood
i
always
preferred
a
little
sour
in
my
sweetmeats
and
in
short
maria
and
i
would
never
do
together
she
would
always
let
me
have
my
own
way
and
say
just
as
you
like
my
dear
charles
now
what
i
want
is
a
wife
who
would
say
sha
do
anything
of
the
kind
you
fellow
you
were
going
to
state
a
fourth
objection
i
think
when
i
interrupted
you
said
scriven
with
the
utmost
composure
the
first
three
i
do
not
judge
very
sound
i
do
answered
charles
and
the
fourth
is
still
sounder
fourthly
and
lastly
then
i
intend
to
marry
somebody
else
whom
asked
scriven
there
my
dear
uncle
you
will
excuse
me
replied
charles
i
will
beg
to
keep
my
own
secret
till
i
am
formally
accepted
and
i
only
mention
the
fact
to
you
to
show
you
that
the
idea
of
a
marriage
between
maria
and
myself
is
a
horse
without
legs
it
wo
go
my
dear
uncle
very
well
said
scriven
gravely
and
now
there
is
another
subject
upon
which
i
want
to
speak
to
you
you
have
been
a
very
long
time
doing
nothing
but
amusing
yourself
you
have
arrived
at
an
age
when
many
men
are
making
fortunes
or
laying
the
foundations
of
honourable
distinction
and
a
great
name
worldly
prosperity
is
too
insecure
a
thing
for
any
man
to
rest
contented
with
that
which
fate
or
fortune
has
chosen
to
bestow
without
further
exertions
of
his
own
a
man
must
labour
to
gain
if
he
would
wish
to
maintain
and
i
think
it
high
time
that
you
should
adopt
some
steady
pursuit
and
give
up
this
reckless
roaming
about
the
world
you
have
passed
the
time
at
which
those
professions
usually
selected
by
young
men
of
gay
dispositions
idle
habits
and
small
brains
are
open
to
aspiring
youths
like
yourself
i
mean
the
army
and
navy
for
law
physic
or
divinity
you
are
not
fitted
either
by
intellect
study
or
character
mercantile
pursuits
however
may
be
embraced
at
a
later
period
of
life
and
with
less
preparation
to
them
i
should
advise
you
strongly
and
urge
you
warmly
to
apply
yourself
and
that
at
once
charles
marston
was
a
good
deal
annoyed
by
his
uncle
lecture
not
so
much
at
the
matter
for
he
could
not
help
acknowledging
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
good
sense
in
what
scriven
said
as
at
the
manner
which
was
dictatorial
cold
and
a
little
contemptuous
he
replied
therefore
i
am
quite
well
aware
my
dear
uncle
that
for
the
mercantile
profession
neither
a
large
portion
of
intellect
a
refined
education
nor
an
amiable
character
is
required
an
instinct
of
gain
supplies
all
deficiencies
and
although
higher
qualities
may
and
often
do
embellish
the
character
of
a
merchant
many
men
do
get
on
quite
as
well
without
however
there
is
a
good
deal
of
justice
in
your
observations
and
although
as
you
know
i
am
not
famous
for
thinking
scriven
nodded
his
head
i
have
thought
of
two
or
three
of
the
topics
which
you
have
discussed
and
moreover
some
time
ago
i
wrote
to
my
dear
father
informing
him
of
all
my
views
hopes
and
wishes
without
the
slightest
reserve
according
to
his
directions
and
advice
i
shall
act
as
soon
as
i
receive
his
answer
for
i
can
perfectly
trust
to
his
kindness
to
his
liberality
and
to
his
judgment
very
good
said
scriven
i
trust
and
am
even
sure
that
his
views
will
be
the
same
as
my
own
for
although
your
father
is
an
exceedingly
eccentric
man
and
never
acts
as
any
other
man
would
act
yet
he
is
in
the
main
a
man
of
good
sense
and
there
are
circumstances
charles
marston
did
not
at
all
like
the
tone
in
which
scriven
was
speaking
of
his
father
he
felt
himself
growing
angry
and
he
knew
that
if
he
suffered
the
sensation
to
go
on
receiving
little
additions
every
moment
from
his
uncle
observations
his
anger
would
explode
he
therefore
thought
it
better
to
cut
the
matter
short
and
interrupt
scriven
picture
of
his
father
character
you
pride
yourself
upon
being
a
plain
speaker
my
dear
sir
he
said
but
observations
upon
my
father
eccentricity
as
you
term
it
are
not
pleasant
to
me
having
therefore
listened
attentively
to
your
exhortations
on
marriage
and
commerce
i
will
revert
if
you
please
to
the
question
i
put
regarding
miss
hayley
will
you
propound
it
said
scriven
i
did
not
take
a
note
of
it
it
was
simply
answered
charles
whether
my
aunt
did
not
tell
you
that
i
intended
to
go
down
yesterday
at
three
to
bring
miss
hayley
to
town
for
the
purpose
of
having
her
properly
taken
care
of
poor
thing
and
whether
you
did
not
immediately
set
out
to
forestal
me
and
carry
her
off
to
a
madhouse
one
answer
to
the
three
clauses
of
your
question
will
suffice
replied
scriven
perfectly
unmoved
yes
then
i
must
beg
to
know
said
charles
where
you
have
carried
her
for
i
am
determined
after
the
state
in
which
i
lately
found
her
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
that
she
is
properly
protected
for
the
rest
of
her
life
and
to
provide
for
it
out
of
my
own
income
i
promised
to
answer
your
question
as
first
put
answered
scriven
coolly
and
i
have
done
so
but
i
promised
no
more
and
now
i
beg
leave
to
say
that
i
shall
not
tell
you
where
i
have
placed
miss
hayley
and
pray
why
not
demanded
charles
in
a
sharp
tone
because
i
have
more
consideration
for
your
income
than
you
have
yourself
young
man
replied
his
uncle
you
will
soon
have
need
of
it
every
penny
of
it
sir
and
more
important
duties
to
perform
with
it
i
do
not
understand
your
meaning
sir
rejoined
charles
a
little
surprised
by
a
very
meaning
look
upon
scriven
face
which
was
rarely
suffered
to
convey
anything
more
than
his
exact
words
implied
it
is
very
simple
said
scriven
rising
and
pushing
over
to
his
nephew
two
papers
which
he
had
held
in
his
hand
for
the
last
five
minutes
by
these
two
letters
you
will
see
what
i
mean
the
one
i
received
more
than
a
month
ago
when
i
wrote
to
you
the
other
yesterday
morning
your
father
is
a
bankrupt
charles
marston
that
is
all
and
now
i
must
go
to
the
for
it
is
past
the
hour
chapter
xv
lady
anne
mellent
was
seated
alone
in
her
in
the
large
and
handsome
which
had
been
inhabited
for
many
years
by
her
father
and
grandfather
she
looked
less
gay
more
thoughtful
than
usual
perhaps
the
weather
might
have
some
share
in
depressing
for
most
people
born
in
england
are
more
or
less
barometers
and
subject
to
be
raised
or
depressed
by
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
foreigners
i
believe
generally
imagine
that
the
cause
of
two
englishmen
as
soon
as
they
meet
beginning
to
talk
of
the
weather
is
that
they
have
nothing
else
to
talk
of
or
that
the
variation
of
our
changeable
climate
is
the
most
prominent
fact
in
the
natural
history
of
the
land
or
because
the
weather
is
the
only
open
question
free
from
all
tinge
of
the
party
spirit
which
affects
all
other
things
in
our
native
country
but
the
real
cause
lies
deeper
it
is
that
in
almost
all
instances
the
fibres
of
an
englishman
body
are
affected
by
the
changes
of
the
weather
like
the
strings
of
a
fine
instrument
more
or
less
of
course
according
to
the
constitution
of
the
individual
but
still
as
i
have
said
in
most
men
it
is
so
and
the
mind
being
in
tune
or
out
of
tune
in
consequence
emits
sounds
accordingly
now
one
of
the
strange
vicissitudes
of
climate
had
taken
place
which
are
so
common
under
our
skies
a
day
or
two
of
fine
clear
summer
weather
had
been
succeeded
by
a
morning
covered
with
thick
grey
clouds
while
the
east
wind
hurried
a
sort
of
dim
and
filmy
mist
through
the
air
cutting
to
the
marrow
all
who
exposed
themselves
to
its
influence
it
was
the
true
picture
of
a
reverse
of
fortune
the
summer
sun
of
prosperity
clouded
dim
uncertainty
pervading
the
atmosphere
and
the
cold
and
cutting
blast
of
ingratitude
and
neglect
and
contemptuous
pity
chilling
the
very
soul
nevertheless
although
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
lady
anne
mellent
was
not
at
all
affected
by
the
weather
yet
her
grave
and
meditative
mood
had
other
stronger
causes
she
had
a
great
deal
to
think
of
just
then
and
she
leaned
her
fair
brow
upon
her
hand
the
thick
glossy
ringlets
falling
over
her
taper
fingers
and
her
eyes
fixed
upon
a
sheet
of
whereon
her
other
hand
was
fancifully
sketching
all
sorts
of
strange
figures
her
mind
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
her
hand
was
about
or
what
her
eye
was
fixed
upon
i
do
not
know
what
part
or
portion
of
the
strange
mixed
whole
expressed
by
the
little
monosyllable
man
it
is
that
occupies
itself
with
trifles
while
the
high
spirits
the
sensitive
soul
and
the
intellectual
mind
are
engaged
in
reasonings
deep
of
other
mightier
things
but
so
it
often
is
that
when
the
brain
and
heart
are
most
busy
with
strong
thoughts
something
i
know
not
what
gives
employment
to
the
corporeal
faculties
just
as
a
nurse
amuses
a
sick
child
with
playthings
while
two
learned
doctors
are
consulting
of
its
state
thus
it
was
now
with
lady
anne
her
mind
saw
not
the
things
she
was
drawing
the
dancing
men
and
women
the
flowers
the
fruits
the
trees
the
wild
and
graceful
arabesques
the
ruined
towns
and
castles
the
volutes
the
capitals
the
columns
she
had
not
an
idea
of
what
she
was
about
but
deep
in
some
little
chamber
of
the
brain
with
the
doors
and
windows
closed
while
imagination
held
a
taper
and
memory
spread
out
a
map
before
her
the
mind
sat
and
studied
the
chart
of
the
past
trying
to
lay
out
plans
for
carrying
on
into
the
unexplored
future
the
roads
along
which
her
destiny
had
hitherto
run
she
was
startled
from
her
reverie
by
a
servant
opening
the
door
and
announcing
charles
marston
and
raising
her
head
with
a
slight
glow
upon
her
cheek
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
with
frank
and
kindly
greeting
well
you
have
come
to
see
me
at
length
she
said
and
i
suppose
i
must
take
your
yesterday
apologies
in
good
part
especially
as
i
find
that
one
of
the
two
letters
did
arrive
and
i
have
been
reading
this
morning
all
the
nonsense
it
contains
with
a
great
deal
of
interest
and
satisfaction
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
like
nonsense
either
for
pleasure
or
amusement
sense
is
so
hard
so
square
and
so
sharp
in
the
points
that
it
is
always
scratching
one
somewhere
i
am
sure
adam
and
eve
must
have
been
talking
nonsense
to
each
other
all
day
long
in
paradise
otherwise
it
would
not
have
been
half
so
pleasant
a
place
as
it
is
represented
charles
marston
took
a
seat
by
her
side
with
a
very
faint
smile
saying
i
am
afraid
dear
lady
anne
that
i
must
give
up
nonsense
for
the
future
and
devote
myself
to
dull
hard
dry
sense
stir
the
fire
charles
marston
replied
his
fair
companion
the
cold
east
wind
has
made
you
melancholy
now
for
the
last
of
an
hour
i
have
myself
been
much
more
sober
and
reflective
than
is
at
all
proper
and
right
and
i
do
not
choose
to
be
encouraged
in
such
bad
habits
by
the
seriousness
of
anybody
else
what
can
have
made
serious
asked
charles
marston
in
a
tone
of
doubt
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
paper
on
which
lady
anne
had
been
sketching
your
gravity
must
have
been
somewhat
frolicsome
good
heaven
did
i
draw
all
that
she
exclaimed
looking
down
at
the
paper
to
which
he
pointed
i
was
not
in
the
least
aware
of
it
nay
then
you
must
have
been
serious
indeed
replied
charles
marston
with
a
tone
both
of
surprise
and
sympathy
what
can
have
happened
to
oppress
your
light
heart
what
can
have
happened
to
oppress
yours
charles
rejoined
lady
anne
something
must
have
occurred
i
am
sure
for
though
i
have
known
you
from
childhood
i
never
saw
you
in
such
a
mood
till
now
what
is
it
a
change
of
fortune
dear
lady
anne
he
said
implying
the
relinquishment
of
the
dearest
and
fondest
hopes
my
heart
ever
entertained
hopes
and
wishes
which
though
treated
gaily
lightly
perhaps
were
not
the
less
deeply
rooted
the
less
profoundly
felt
he
paused
for
a
moment
as
if
summoning
strength
to
go
on
with
a
task
that
nearly
overpowered
him
and
she
sat
gazing
on
his
face
with
a
look
of
anxious
alarm
at
length
he
proceeded
i
have
loved
you
lady
anne
deeply
sincerely
well
i
can
assure
you
i
know
all
that
she
exclaimed
resuming
for
a
moment
her
gay
and
sparkling
manner
you
told
me
so
twelve
months
ago
in
rome
you
told
me
so
years
ago
when
i
was
a
foolish
girl
of
thirteen
and
i
believed
you
both
times
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
cease
to
love
me
now
cease
to
love
you
exclaimed
charles
marston
i
love
you
better
more
dearly
than
ever
just
as
one
prizes
a
jewel
the
last
possession
that
one
has
which
he
knows
must
be
parted
with
soon
no
you
do
not
love
me
she
said
or
you
would
not
keep
me
in
suspense
what
has
happened
charles
tell
me
at
once
what
has
happened
it
can
be
done
in
very
few
words
he
replied
when
i
told
you
in
rome
how
i
loved
you
i
myself
possessed
a
considerable
fortune
settled
upon
me
by
my
father
at
the
time
of
my
mother
death
what
she
inherited
from
her
father
at
that
time
i
believed
that
sooner
or
later
very
considerable
wealth
in
addition
must
be
mine
and
although
that
fact
could
not
change
the
difference
between
your
rank
and
mine
yet
it
in
some
degree
justified
me
in
seeking
your
hand
and
might
have
justified
you
in
giving
it
to
one
who
had
known
and
loved
you
as
you
say
from
childhood
well
well
he
continued
seeing
her
make
an
impatient
gesture
as
if
to
hurry
his
tale
the
rest
is
soon
told
this
morning
my
uncle
in
the
most
unkind
and
indifferent
manner
informed
me
that
my
father
was
a
bankrupt
i
need
not
tell
you
lady
anne
who
i
think
know
me
well
that
my
first
act
must
be
to
restore
to
my
father
the
income
he
settled
upon
me
i
will
not
indeed
throw
my
mother
fortune
into
the
hands
of
his
creditors
for
that
i
do
not
feel
myself
called
upon
to
do
but
the
income
of
course
is
his
for
his
life
well
said
lady
anne
as
if
she
did
not
see
the
deduction
which
he
would
draw
i
must
of
course
continued
charles
embrace
some
pursuit
in
order
to
raise
the
fallen
fortunes
of
my
family
that
is
painful
enough
for
one
of
my
habits
and
character
but
there
remains
the
still
more
painful
task
of
abandoning
those
hopes
which
you
once
permitted
me
to
entertain
of
giving
you
back
every
engagement
and
every
promise
you
made
me
and
nerving
my
mind
to
all
that
must
follow
nonsense
exclaimed
lady
anne
how
long
is
it
since
you
heard
this
news
not
an
hour
ago
he
answered
i
determined
to
come
hither
at
once
and
do
what
was
right
by
you
though
i
passed
nearly
an
hour
in
the
park
struggling
with
thoughts
which
drove
me
mad
you
should
have
come
here
directly
she
answered
in
a
quiet
tone
and
i
would
have
taught
you
to
overcome
such
thoughts
by
showing
you
what
weak
and
foolish
thoughts
they
were
i
was
praising
nonsense
just
now
but
what
i
meant
was
merry
not
sad
nonsense
now
this
is
very
sad
nonsense
indeed
do
you
pretend
to
know
me
do
you
pretend
to
love
me
do
you
pretend
to
esteem
me
and
yet
suppose
that
any
accidental
change
of
circumstances
any
mere
pitiful
reverse
of
fortune
would
justify
me
in
my
own
eyes
for
wishing
to
withdraw
from
engagements
formed
with
as
little
consideration
of
wealth
upon
my
part
as
upon
yours
i
do
you
full
justice
charles
and
believe
that
you
cared
no
more
for
my
fortune
when
you
asked
my
hand
than
i
would
do
for
the
crown
of
england
i
believed
and
do
believe
that
you
would
have
sought
me
for
your
wife
that
you
would
still
seek
me
for
your
wife
if
i
had
little
or
nothing
and
you
have
done
very
wrong
even
for
one
moment
to
look
upon
this
event
except
as
a
misfortune
which
affects
us
both
i
can
not
treat
this
subject
so
lightly
as
i
might
do
most
others
because
i
know
what
has
occurred
must
be
very
painful
to
you
on
your
good
father
account
but
thank
god
what
i
do
possess
although
not
so
large
as
is
generally
supposed
is
still
affluence
nay
wealth
make
over
your
income
to
your
father
as
you
propose
that
will
be
abundant
for
him
and
you
will
share
mine
charles
marston
laid
his
hand
upon
hers
and
gazed
at
her
with
deep
affection
but
he
still
hesitated
every
one
will
say
he
replied
and
your
guardians
above
all
that
you
have
thrown
yourself
away
upon
a
i
am
my
own
guardian
she
answered
with
a
gay
laugh
thank
god
on
the
of
last
month
i
arrived
at
the
discreet
age
of
so
you
have
no
excuse
sir
i
see
clearly
that
you
do
not
wish
to
marry
me
that
you
are
fickle
faithless
and
false
to
all
your
vows
that
you
have
fallen
in
love
with
some
greek
or
some
circassian
or
some
lady
turk
but
i
will
have
a
distinct
answer
charles
marston
before
you
quit
this
room
you
shall
say
or
if
you
say
well
and
good
there
is
peace
between
us
but
if
you
say
i
will
prosecute
you
for
a
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
and
produce
all
your
letters
in
open
court
i
can
establish
a
clear
case
against
you
so
think
of
the
consequences
before
you
decide
she
spoke
gaily
and
cheerfully
but
when
charles
arm
glided
round
her
waist
and
he
pressed
his
answer
on
her
lips
lady
anne
eyes
overflowed
with
tears
you
have
treated
me
very
ill
charles
she
said
and
i
shall
not
forgive
you
for
the
next
how
could
you
think
so
meanly
and
so
basely
of
me
did
i
ever
talk
to
you
about
settlements
or
stipulate
for
or
require
that
you
should
bring
an
equal
share
to
the
housekeeping
with
myself
or
did
i
set
others
on
to
do
that
which
i
was
ashamed
to
do
fie
fie
do
not
attempt
to
justify
it
for
it
was
unjustifiable
i
am
glad
of
it
for
one
thing
she
added
dashing
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
looking
up
with
one
of
her
sparkling
laughs
if
ever
i
want
to
tease
you
it
will
give
me
something
to
reproach
you
with
you
sha
hear
the
last
of
it
for
some
time
i
can
assure
you
and
i
tell
dear
lady
fleetwood
how
mercenary
you
are
and
that
you
think
marriage
is
merely
a
matter
of
property
that
people
should
be
perfectly
equal
in
that
respect
at
least
then
how
she
will
scold
you
but
now
tell
me
all
about
it
let
me
hear
how
your
delightful
uncle
communicated
this
pleasant
intelligence
he
always
puts
me
more
in
mind
of
the
statue
in
giovanni
than
anything
of
flesh
and
blood
i
ever
saw
i
will
answer
for
it
he
told
the
whole
as
if
he
were
an
iceberg
and
every
word
were
snow
something
like
it
indeed
answered
charles
but
yet
there
was
a
keen
frosty
wind
coming
from
the
iceberg
which
was
very
cutting
and
he
proceeded
to
give
his
fair
companion
a
more
detailed
account
of
his
conversation
with
his
uncle
taking
care
to
avoid
that
part
of
the
discussion
which
had
referred
to
maria
monkton
women
eyes
are
very
keen
however
and
there
is
something
approaching
to
instinct
in
the
clearness
of
their
perceptions
with
regard
to
everything
where
other
women
are
concerned
it
is
only
jealousy
that
ever
blinds
them
and
there
they
are
as
blind
as
the
rest
of
the
world
but
lady
anne
was
not
jealous
of
maria
and
therefore
she
seemed
to
divine
in
a
moment
what
had
been
scriven
principal
scheme
charles
had
merely
said
he
proposed
to
me
several
plans
of
action
none
of
which
suited
me
one
of
them
i
am
sure
said
lady
anne
was
to
marry
your
cousin
maria
dear
maria
how
often
people
have
settled
that
for
her
but
i
could
tell
good
scriven
even
if
you
had
been
willing
his
scheme
would
not
have
succeeded
maria
is
in
love
charles
maria
is
in
love
charles
marston
started
and
looked
surprised
with
whom
he
exclaimed
nay
it
is
hardly
fair
to
tell
you
replied
lady
anne
and
i
will
keep
you
in
suspense
as
you
kept
me
just
now
moreover
i
will
tease
you
about
it
ungrateful
man
watch
me
well
charles
for
the
next
two
or
three
weeks
and
if
you
see
me
flirt
unconscionably
with
any
man
while
maria
stands
calm
and
by
be
you
sure
that
man
is
her
lover
and
think
that
i
am
trying
to
win
him
from
her
if
you
dare
charles
laid
his
hand
upon
hers
and
gazed
confidently
into
her
eyes
you
can
not
make
me
jealous
if
you
would
he
said
i
know
you
too
well
and
yet
you
would
not
condescend
to
give
colonel
middleton
a
letter
to
me
replied
lady
anne
with
a
meaning
smile
simply
because
i
did
not
feel
myself
entitled
to
take
such
a
liberty
replied
charles
marston
without
at
least
telling
him
our
relative
situation
towards
each
other
which
you
forbade
me
to
mention
to
any
one
till
you
were
of
age
so
so
then
frank
middleton
is
the
man
of
maria
heart
is
he
it
must
have
been
very
rapid
or
i
must
have
misunderstood
her
for
i
think
she
told
me
he
had
only
delivered
my
letter
the
day
before
yesterday
oh
he
conquers
exceedingly
quickly
exclaimed
his
fair
companion
it
is
quite
true
he
only
delivered
the
letter
the
day
before
yesterday
and
yet
maria
is
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
him
and
will
marry
him
as
you
will
see
i
was
introduced
to
him
the
same
day
and
though
not
quite
in
love
with
him
do
you
know
my
dear
charles
i
was
so
smitten
that
i
asked
him
to
dine
with
me
yesterday
which
he
accordingly
did
we
had
the
pleasantest
evening
possible
quite
for
although
good
old
brice
sat
out
the
dinner
very
patiently
yet
she
went
to
her
own
room
as
usual
immediately
after
and
left
him
to
make
me
a
proposal
if
he
thought
fit
he
did
not
do
it
which
after
all
the
encouragement
i
gave
him
was
very
singular
but
you
men
are
the
most
ungrateful
creatures
in
the
world
of
that
i
am
convinced
there
now
make
the
most
of
it
for
you
shall
not
have
one
word
of
explanation
from
me
till
i
think
fit
and
you
shall
see
me
go
on
every
day
with
this
colonel
middleton
as
wildly
and
as
madly
as
i
please
without
being
in
the
least
jealous
unless
i
permit
you
charles
caught
her
in
his
arms
exclaiming
in
his
old
gay
reckless
tone
i
defy
you
little
tormentor
i
have
a
great
mind
to
punish
you
for
your
sauciness
by
kissing
you
till
you
carry
the
marks
upon
your
lips
and
cheeks
all
over
london
but
then
gently
relaxing
his
embrace
he
added
in
a
softer
and
sadder
tone
after
the
proofs
of
love
you
have
given
me
dear
anne
i
could
not
doubt
you
do
what
you
would
and
in
despite
of
all
you
say
i
know
you
would
not
pain
me
for
a
moment
even
by
a
word
or
look
be
not
pained
then
dear
charles
she
answered
and
be
sure
that
for
whatever
you
see
i
have
a
motive
and
a
strong
one
i
shall
see
very
little
i
fear
replied
charles
marston
for
except
during
a
short
morning
visit
here
and
an
occasional
party
at
dear
aunt
fleetwood
i
shall
seldom
meet
with
you
till
i
have
forced
my
way
into
the
gay
world
again
after
an
eighteen
months
absence
which
is
quite
sufficient
to
make
all
the
affectionate
people
in
london
forget
one
come
here
and
dine
every
day
if
you
will
replied
lady
anne
laughing
i
care
not
who
knows
it
now
and
only
cared
before
charles
because
i
hate
lectures
and
dislike
opposition
when
i
am
determined
to
have
my
own
way
if
you
meet
frank
middleton
here
you
will
of
course
be
very
civil
to
him
and
if
i
want
to
speak
to
him
alone
i
can
take
him
into
another
room
you
know
of
course
of
course
answered
charles
in
the
same
tone
of
light
but
i
have
another
task
upon
my
hands
which
i
must
now
run
away
to
fulfil
that
of
nursing
my
poor
friend
winkworth
this
announcement
called
forth
questions
which
again
required
replies
and
after
hearing
the
whole
story
lady
anne
exclaimed
get
him
well
as
soon
as
possible
for
i
intend
to
make
you
all
come
down
and
spend
a
happy
week
with
me
in
the
country
either
at
harley
or
belford
or
caermarthen
or
somewhere
lady
fleetwood
and
maria
and
you
and
middleton
and
winkworth
and
all
i
took
a
great
liking
to
that
old
man
charles
so
you
must
engage
him
for
me
charles
marston
promised
to
obey
and
after
a
few
more
words
with
which
perhaps
the
reader
may
have
little
to
do
he
was
taking
his
departure
and
had
already
reached
the
door
of
the
when
lady
anne
called
him
back
charles
charles
she
said
i
want
to
speak
to
you
and
now
remember
i
am
talking
seriously
for
once
in
my
life
i
am
going
to
make
a
declaration
so
remember
it
it
is
somewhat
unusual
and
rather
the
reverse
of
what
ordinarily
takes
place
but
no
matter
i
love
you
truly
and
sincerely
and
none
but
you
and
she
laid
her
hand
affectionately
upon
his
arm
adding
i
never
shall
love
any
other
and
i
say
this
because
your
confidence
without
any
wish
on
my
part
to
put
it
to
the
proof
may
be
tried
somewhat
severely
it
will
stand
the
test
answered
charles
marston
i
were
unworthy
of
your
love
dear
anne
if
i
could
doubt
you
for
a
moment
chapter
xvi
the
day
was
near
its
close
and
the
keen
clear
easterly
wind
had
in
the
end
swept
all
clouds
and
mist
from
the
air
leaving
the
features
of
the
landscape
sharp
and
defined
in
the
peculiar
purple
light
of
the
evening
when
a
man
with
a
mahogany
box
upon
his
back
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
little
hovel
on
the
wide
wild
common
to
which
i
have
so
frequently
had
occasion
to
refer
about
of
an
hour
before
in
trudging
with
his
pack
out
of
the
neighbouring
little
town
he
had
been
passed
by
a
coming
from
the
side
of
london
and
on
turning
his
head
he
had
seen
that
it
contained
only
a
single
traveller
a
handsome
and
young
man
with
a
complexion
considerably
darker
than
is
usually
found
amongst
englishmen
the
pedlar
very
naturally
concluded
that
the
stranger
was
nothing
to
him
nor
he
to
the
stranger
and
that
he
should
never
behold
his
face
again
and
trudging
upon
his
way
over
the
common
he
turned
a
few
steps
aside
to
see
if
the
inhabitants
of
the
hovel
who
had
more
than
once
purchased
bodkins
and
needles
and
such
little
articles
of
him
would
now
be
tempted
by
any
of
his
wares
pedlars
although
by
continual
chaffering
with
every
different
variety
of
human
beings
they
usually
acquire
a
great
deal
of
shrewdness
not
to
say
cunning
may
be
deceived
in
their
calculations
as
well
as
other
people
and
it
proved
so
in
the
present
case
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
and
then
shook
it
saying
to
himself
the
old
in
one
of
her
moping
fits
i
dare
say
but
still
he
received
no
answer
and
then
going
to
the
little
window
he
tried
to
look
in
there
was
a
board
up
in
the
inside
however
which
effectually
prevented
him
from
seeing
and
he
was
about
to
turn
away
when
he
perceived
a
tall
figure
advancing
towards
him
from
the
side
of
the
now
the
pedlar
was
a
stout
man
of
about
fifty
years
of
age
and
having
passed
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
hardy
excise
he
was
a
match
for
most
men
in
point
of
strength
but
having
had
occasion
more
than
once
to
fight
for
the
worldly
goods
and
chattels
which
he
carried
on
his
back
he
always
cast
a
suspicious
eye
towards
any
one
who
approached
him
hastily
which
was
the
case
with
the
stranger
and
therefore
unslinging
his
pack
he
put
it
down
behind
him
that
he
might
have
his
right
arm
more
at
liberty
for
the
exercise
of
the
stout
oaken
staff
with
which
it
was
armed
at
the
moment
when
he
first
perceived
the
figure
advancing
towards
him
it
was
coming
up
between
the
high
sandy
banks
through
which
a
little
rivulet
flowed
and
the
evening
sun
cast
a
deep
shadow
upon
it
the
instant
after
however
it
emerged
into
the
broad
light
and
the
whole
dress
and
appearance
removed
at
once
anything
like
apprehension
which
he
had
previously
felt
another
minute
showed
him
the
face
which
he
had
seen
in
the
and
touching
his
hat
he
replaced
his
box
upon
his
shoulders
in
order
to
walk
away
with
it
when
he
saw
the
stranger
approach
the
door
of
the
hovel
and
knock
for
admission
there
no
one
in
there
sir
said
the
pedlar
in
a
civil
tone
they
are
all
gone
poor
people
i
suppose
perhaps
the
old
lady
is
dead
for
she
was
in
a
failing
sort
of
way
when
last
i
passed
no
she
is
not
dead
replied
the
stranger
but
it
is
probable
a
friend
of
mine
who
took
an
interest
in
her
has
provided
for
her
more
comfortably
than
she
could
be
here
i
did
not
think
he
would
have
been
so
rapid
in
his
proceedings
or
i
might
have
spared
myself
a
journey
i
wonder
where
the
boy
is
who
i
hear
was
with
her
are
you
sure
he
is
not
in
the
cottage
he
is
not
there
sir
the
place
is
all
shut
up
replied
the
pedlar
he
a
good
boy
and
was
very
kind
to
the
poor
woman
though
the
people
said
they
were
not
relations
and
indeed
i
always
thought
she
must
have
been
a
gentlewoman
at
one
time
you
were
not
far
wrong
replied
henry
hayley
for
he
it
was
i
suppose
you
are
well
acquainted
with
the
country
around
he
continued
turning
away
from
the
hovel
and
walking
on
by
the
side
towards
the
highroad
i
know
every
inch
of
it
answered
the
man
for
fifty
miles
round
and
more
and
many
another
part
of
the
country
besides
i
have
spent
more
than
twenty
years
of
my
life
in
wandering
about
with
my
pack
on
my
back
so
that
there
is
hardly
a
cottage
in
the
counties
i
travel
that
i
do
not
know
perhaps
then
you
can
tell
me
my
best
way
to
the
house
of
a
farmer
named
graves
said
henry
hayley
i
think
it
is
some
six
or
seven
miles
off
i
can
tell
you
the
way
well
enough
sir
replied
the
man
but
i
doubt
with
all
my
telling
that
you
find
it
for
you
see
it
lies
on
the
other
road
and
the
lanes
are
rather
crooked
can
you
show
me
the
way
asked
henry
again
i
shall
be
inclined
to
pay
you
well
for
your
trouble
the
man
hesitated
for
a
moment
but
then
replied
i
may
as
well
go
that
way
as
another
though
it
is
out
of
my
regular
beat
but
is
it
the
old
man
or
the
young
one
you
want
to
see
sir
the
old
one
i
think
replied
henry
what
is
his
age
oh
he
is
upon
seventy
answered
the
pedlar
and
a
strange
old
man
too
i
do
know
whether
he
be
civil
to
you
but
he
not
to
most
people
though
he
a
kind
old
man
at
bottom
i
hear
he
had
some
troubles
when
he
was
younger
and
that
has
made
him
very
cross
ever
since
but
we
had
better
cut
across
the
common
here
for
it
lies
away
there
to
the
westward
henry
turned
according
to
his
guide
directions
and
followed
him
for
some
little
way
in
silence
but
at
length
he
said
what
troubles
were
they
that
you
alluded
to
just
now
as
having
befallen
the
old
man
troubles
that
the
rich
sometimes
bring
upon
the
poor
sir
answered
the
pedlar
just
about
the
time
when
i
first
took
to
this
trade
i
remember
him
as
fine
a
looking
man
of
or
as
any
in
the
whole
county
and
as
gay
and
too
he
had
then
two
children
a
girl
of
about
seventeen
or
eighteen
and
this
young
man
who
now
holds
the
great
farm
he
was
not
above
fourteen
then
and
the
girl
was
the
prettiest
creature
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
and
quite
like
a
lady
poor
mary
graves
i
sha
forget
her
in
a
hurry
but
she
fell
in
love
one
unlucky
day
with
a
gentleman
who
came
down
into
these
parts
from
london
a
rich
merchant
they
said
he
was
he
did
not
behave
well
by
the
old
man
though
not
so
bad
as
they
said
at
first
but
he
coaxed
the
girl
to
go
away
with
him
without
her
knowledge
and
for
a
long
time
farmer
graves
thought
he
had
seduced
her
and
it
broke
his
heart
in
the
end
however
he
found
that
they
were
really
married
but
she
died
with
her
first
child
poor
thing
and
the
old
man
has
never
got
over
it
poor
man
said
henry
in
a
very
grave
tone
it
is
a
sad
tale
indeed
did
his
daughter
husband
never
do
anything
to
compensate
for
the
pain
he
had
inflicted
there
are
some
things
sir
said
the
pedlar
for
which
there
is
no
compensation
he
could
not
give
him
back
his
child
again
he
could
not
wipe
out
a
long
year
of
misery
during
which
the
old
man
was
ruined
and
dishonoured
he
could
never
make
his
mind
what
it
was
before
nor
take
out
of
his
heart
all
the
bitterness
he
had
planted
there
i
have
heard
indeed
that
he
did
offer
to
do
a
great
deal
which
farmer
graves
would
not
accept
of
and
the
people
say
that
it
was
through
him
that
the
young
man
was
enabled
to
take
this
great
farm
he
now
holds
and
to
stock
it
they
never
knew
rightly
who
he
really
was
for
they
say
the
name
he
was
married
under
was
a
feigned
one
and
all
they
could
find
out
was
that
he
was
a
great
merchant
in
london
for
the
child
was
put
out
to
nurse
for
some
time
and
then
the
father
came
suddenly
and
took
it
away
and
nothing
more
was
ever
heard
of
it
by
the
family
at
least
henry
hayley
fell
into
deep
thought
and
the
reader
acquainted
with
the
early
part
of
his
history
may
easily
conceive
the
nature
of
his
meditation
after
a
time
however
as
they
walked
on
he
resumed
the
conversation
with
his
companion
but
changed
the
subject
entirely
talking
of
the
state
of
the
country
and
the
condition
of
the
country
people
of
the
residents
in
the
neighbourhood
and
of
the
curious
state
of
wandering
commerce
by
which
his
companion
gained
his
livelihood
he
found
him
a
shrewd
intelligent
man
who
was
evidently
accustomed
during
the
solitary
hours
he
passed
in
proceeding
from
place
to
place
to
think
a
great
deal
and
deeply
of
the
many
different
things
that
came
to
his
knowledge
in
his
travels
over
the
face
of
the
country
it
seemed
that
while
disposing
of
his
wares
he
gained
in
exchange
not
only
money
but
the
history
of
those
with
whom
he
dealt
and
that
in
journeying
onwards
he
turned
over
and
over
in
thought
all
the
little
facts
he
had
acquired
or
the
scenes
that
he
had
witnessed
reasoning
upon
them
with
great
acuteness
and
good
sense
so
that
he
was
ever
ready
to
comment
with
a
degree
of
caustic
precision
unusual
in
the
small
trader
of
a
town
who
has
little
leisure
for
any
thoughts
unconnected
with
his
business
curiosity
of
course
was
one
trait
in
his
character
and
he
did
not
fail
to
make
sundry
efforts
to
learn
more
of
his
companion
and
to
discover
what
could
be
his
business
with
old
farmer
graves
henry
however
set
all
questions
at
defiance
and
in
the
end
the
pedlar
seeing
that
it
was
in
vain
to
inquire
gave
up
his
efforts
in
despair
that
is
a
house
said
henry
as
they
were
approaching
the
opposite
side
of
the
common
it
seems
hardly
fit
for
the
habitation
of
a
human
being
has
it
any
occupants
now
no
sir
none
at
present
replied
his
companion
it
is
a
poor
place
surely
and
yet
it
is
better
than
it
was
twelve
months
ago
for
the
gentleman
who
lives
in
the
large
house
on
the
hill
there
you
can
not
see
it
for
the
trees
had
the
thatch
mended
he
does
not
think
like
a
great
many
of
the
gentlemen
about
and
sets
to
work
in
a
different
way
with
the
poor
it
answers
pretty
well
sometimes
and
did
in
the
instance
of
the
lad
who
lived
here
how
was
that
asked
the
young
wanderer
i
should
like
to
have
an
example
of
his
way
of
dealing
with
the
poor
the
subject
is
a
very
interesting
one
why
sir
the
way
was
this
answered
the
pedlar
i
had
it
from
the
who
was
with
him
when
it
all
happened
and
he
an
honest
fellow
so
i
sure
the
story
true
payne
the
gentleman
who
lives
up
there
was
coming
home
from
shooting
one
day
last
october
he
very
fond
of
shooting
and
as
he
was
crossing
this
bit
of
the
common
about
the
time
of
sunset
with
his
two
keepers
he
saw
this
hut
and
looked
up
at
it
i
must
tell
you
it
was
raining
as
hard
as
it
could
pour
and
blowing
fit
to
freeze
one
so
he
said
to
the
head
keeper
suppose
nobody
lives
in
that
place
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
the
keeper
there
does
and
then
he
told
him
all
about
it
there
was
a
poor
lad
who
had
lived
in
the
parish
a
good
many
years
an
orphan
and
as
he
had
neither
father
nor
mother
to
look
after
him
he
had
been
badly
enough
brought
up
that
was
billy
first
misfortune
the
people
pitied
him
a
little
and
some
of
the
farmers
gave
him
a
bit
of
work
to
do
from
time
to
time
but
bill
was
idle
and
bill
was
wild
and
he
got
turned
off
here
and
he
got
turned
off
there
and
in
the
end
everybody
abused
him
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
well
to
make
matters
worse
when
he
was
half
starved
himself
he
must
needs
have
some
one
to
starve
with
him
and
so
he
married
a
poor
girl
who
had
worked
in
the
same
fields
with
him
and
you
may
guess
what
a
to
do
there
was
in
the
parish
i
believe
have
hanged
him
for
it
if
they
could
but
have
proved
that
marriage
was
felony
he
tried
to
get
work
and
his
wife
tried
but
no
one
would
have
anything
to
say
to
him
though
he
promised
hard
to
do
better
they
all
said
he
was
lazy
and
idle
which
was
true
enough
and
they
said
his
wife
was
as
bad
which
might
be
true
too
for
aught
i
know
but
however
the
two
poor
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
till
they
took
refuge
in
that
hovel
we
passed
just
now
the
boy
said
he
would
not
go
into
house
to
be
separated
from
his
wife
and
there
they
lived
or
i
should
rather
say
there
they
were
dying
when
payne
passed
the
keeper
told
him
how
terribly
they
were
off
and
that
they
were
both
ill
of
pure
starvation
and
want
of
covering
well
the
gentleman
said
he
would
go
in
and
see
with
his
own
eyes
and
he
found
them
the
boy
and
the
girl
and
their
baby
all
crouched
up
together
on
some
straw
with
nothing
on
earth
to
cover
them
during
the
night
but
the
rags
they
had
on
during
the
day
as
half
the
thatch
was
off
the
rain
was
pouring
in
at
the
other
end
of
the
hut
and
the
wind
blowing
through
at
all
quarters
the
lad
had
just
had
a
fit
of
some
kind
brought
on
the
doctor
afterwards
said
by
privation
and
the
girl
was
bathed
in
tears
thinking
he
was
going
to
die
well
payne
is
not
a
man
as
gentlemen
go
and
he
was
very
sorry
to
see
them
in
such
a
state
he
had
some
sandwiches
in
his
pocket
and
some
in
a
bottle
and
that
made
them
the
best
meal
they
had
had
for
many
a
day
he
staid
and
talked
with
them
too
for
an
hour
or
more
and
though
he
did
not
promise
them
much
yet
he
spoke
to
them
kindly
and
did
not
throw
in
the
lad
teeth
all
the
foolish
things
he
had
done
but
asked
him
if
he
were
well
again
and
work
were
given
him
whether
he
would
be
steady
and
industrious
the
lad
looked
at
his
little
wife
and
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
he
would
try
but
that
he
was
sure
that
nobody
would
take
him
for
he
had
asked
for
employment
everywhere
in
vain
then
payne
told
him
not
to
be
downhearted
for
that
when
he
was
well
enough
to
work
he
would
give
a
stray
job
or
two
and
try
him
and
in
the
mean
time
the
girl
might
come
down
to
the
house
for
some
soup
and
bread
hope
a
good
medicine
sir
and
that
he
left
them
and
as
he
went
home
he
thought
how
he
might
do
them
good
and
that
very
night
he
sent
for
two
of
the
farmers
who
were
guardians
of
the
poor
and
talked
to
them
about
the
young
man
at
first
they
were
very
hard
about
it
and
called
william
all
sorts
of
names
for
marrying
when
he
had
no
means
of
supporting
himself
and
worse
still
for
not
coming
into
the
workhouse
and
they
declared
that
if
people
would
but
let
him
alone
and
not
help
him
he
would
soon
be
starved
out
of
his
obstinacy
payne
thought
differently
however
he
said
he
believed
there
were
many
people
who
would
rather
die
of
starvation
than
go
in
and
as
to
his
marriage
he
said
though
it
was
certainly
a
very
foolish
thing
yet
he
had
already
been
punished
more
than
enough
for
what
was
no
crime
after
all
and
he
told
them
too
that
he
thought
from
what
he
had
seen
of
the
lad
it
would
do
him
good
rather
than
harm
for
that
he
would
work
more
steadily
now
that
he
had
somebody
to
work
for
than
he
had
ever
done
before
what
he
said
made
no
impression
upon
one
of
the
farmers
but
the
other
seemed
to
think
there
might
be
some
truth
in
it
and
promised
if
the
lad
got
well
to
give
him
a
trial
payne
took
care
that
he
should
get
well
for
all
that
he
and
the
poor
girl
wanted
was
food
and
covering
and
a
very
little
medicine
and
payne
sent
his
own
doctor
to
him
and
had
the
thatch
mended
and
sent
them
soup
and
bread
every
day
and
now
and
then
some
meat
not
much
indeed
for
he
afterwards
told
the
keeper
that
the
whole
did
not
cost
five
pounds
nevertheless
it
was
quite
enough
for
william
got
strong
and
hearty
again
and
so
did
his
wife
and
the
baby
which
was
but
a
little
bag
of
bones
throve
wonderfully
it
is
strange
what
fine
hardy
babies
starving
people
will
have
sometimes
a
rich
man
child
would
have
been
killed
by
what
that
little
thing
went
through
but
to
cut
my
story
short
sir
when
they
were
all
well
again
and
had
some
clothes
given
to
them
flannel
petticoats
and
jackets
and
things
that
payne
keeps
for
the
poor
they
turned
out
very
tidy
and
payne
first
tried
the
lad
himself
to
work
a
bit
in
his
garden
though
he
did
not
want
him
but
just
for
a
trial
like
and
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
the
lad
was
inclined
to
do
well
he
put
farmer
slade
in
mind
of
his
promise
the
farmer
was
very
willing
when
he
found
all
had
gone
right
and
took
him
upon
the
farm
as
a
labourer
he
has
been
six
months
at
it
now
and
every
one
says
that
there
is
not
a
more
industrious
clever
lad
in
all
the
place
and
things
have
changed
with
him
altogether
for
he
is
gone
down
to
live
in
one
of
the
nice
little
cottages
by
the
farm
for
which
he
pays
a
shilling
quite
regular
and
they
have
contrived
to
pick
up
a
good
lot
of
furniture
part
of
which
he
made
for
himself
for
he
not
a
bad
hand
at
carpentering
and
his
wife
always
neat
and
tidy
and
so
is
the
baby
the
girl
told
me
herself
that
she
got
all
their
clothes
and
such
things
by
her
own
work
in
picking
and
hoeing
that
bill
might
be
able
to
save
a
little
out
of
his
wages
in
case
another
rainy
day
should
come
but
i
do
think
it
will
sir
for
if
they
go
on
as
they
are
going
they
will
make
sunshine
for
themselves
while
the
pedlar
was
telling
his
story
the
truth
of
every
word
of
which
the
author
has
had
an
opportunity
of
ascertaining
he
had
led
the
way
up
the
slope
of
a
little
hill
and
henry
hayley
turned
round
to
take
another
look
at
the
miserable
hovel
which
had
given
rise
to
the
narrative
and
which
was
now
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
behind
them
either
my
eyes
deceive
me
he
said
or
you
are
mistaken
in
saying
that
the
place
is
uninhabited
there
is
smoke
rising
up
out
of
it
do
you
see
so
there
is
said
the
pedlar
turning
round
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
ay
and
there
a
man
down
by
the
pond
there
i
wonder
what
he
about
there
used
to
be
good
fish
in
that
pond
it
belongs
to
mr
payne
as
he
spoke
the
figure
of
another
man
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
hut
and
they
could
hear
a
low
whistle
which
apparently
caused
the
man
at
the
pond
to
turn
round
and
walk
quickly
towards
the
hut
we
had
better
get
on
sir
said
the
pedlar
there
are
some
bad
sort
of
folks
down
here
just
now
and
there
no
knowing
what
they
may
do
what
have
they
been
doing
asked
henry
walking
on
as
he
led
oh
thieving
and
and
poaching
and
all
manner
of
things
replied
the
pedlar
the
people
in
london
are
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
for
these
men
would
not
dare
to
go
on
as
they
do
if
they
could
not
easily
and
quickly
dispose
of
what
they
steal
they
were
caught
once
by
a
cunning
contrivance
and
that
stopped
them
for
a
long
time
how
was
that
effected
asked
henry
why
you
see
sir
replied
the
man
the
way
they
carried
on
their
trade
was
this
they
went
into
a
field
killed
sheep
or
so
skinned
them
upon
the
spot
and
left
the
head
skin
and
feet
in
the
field
then
upon
the
commons
you
know
there
a
great
number
of
donkeys
well
they
used
to
gather
them
all
together
or
as
many
as
they
wanted
put
the
mutton
on
their
backs
and
drive
them
away
ten
or
twelve
miles
to
market
they
found
plenty
of
butchers
ready
to
buy
the
carcases
without
asking
where
they
came
from
just
as
men
buy
game
however
a
man
who
had
a
donkey
on
the
common
found
that
every
now
and
then
he
lost
him
for
a
whole
day
and
sometimes
when
he
came
home
his
back
was
bloody
and
that
roused
suspicion
as
to
how
the
stolen
sheep
were
disposed
of
for
a
long
time
they
could
not
trap
them
but
at
last
a
shrewd
old
fellow
fell
upon
a
plan
and
getting
the
asses
all
together
one
night
they
stuffed
their
hoofs
with
a
compound
of
red
ochre
and
something
else
to
make
it
stiff
and
then
turned
them
loose
well
knowing
they
would
not
go
very
far
before
morning
the
next
day
ten
or
twelve
of
the
donkeys
were
missing
and
a
whole
heap
of
people
set
out
upon
the
track
for
there
were
plenty
of
marks
of
red
ochre
near
the
field
where
some
sheep
had
been
stolen
the
night
before
they
had
no
great
difficulty
now
for
all
along
the
road
the
thieves
had
taken
one
stone
had
a
mark
and
another
stone
had
a
mark
for
nine
or
ten
miles
or
more
till
they
came
to
the
place
where
the
carcases
had
been
carried
and
there
they
found
thieves
and
sheep
and
asses
and
all
that
stopped
the
business
for
some
time
but
now
they
have
got
another
plan
which
is
safer
a
man
comes
down
from
london
in
a
light
cart
and
there
are
five
or
six
different
places
at
each
of
which
he
stops
gets
out
and
goes
into
the
next
field
there
he
finds
whatever
has
been
stolen
during
the
night
and
whatever
it
may
be
whether
it
be
a
dead
sheep
fowls
or
game
linen
clothes
or
anything
else
there
is
sure
to
be
a
ticket
upon
it
with
the
price
marked
if
he
likes
the
price
he
takes
the
goods
and
he
almost
always
does
for
they
never
put
half
the
value
upon
them
and
then
he
sends
down
the
money
every
week
to
what
they
call
their
bankers
in
some
of
the
towns
near
and
they
take
the
to
that
which
they
left
upon
the
goods
and
get
the
money
giving
the
banker
his
share
is
it
possible
that
such
a
system
is
tolerated
in
england
exclaimed
henry
why
it
could
not
be
carried
on
even
in
spain
where
heaven
knows
justice
is
lax
enough
it
true
notwithstanding
said
the
pedlar
they
would
have
been
caught
long
ago
by
the
old
bow
street
runners
for
they
would
have
pounced
upon
the
people
in
london
but
you
see
sir
we
go
on
improving
this
country
of
ours
we
are
always
improving
that
is
to
say
mending
one
thing
and
spoiling
another
the
streets
of
london
are
i
dare
say
a
great
deal
quieter
and
safer
though
we
hear
of
bad
things
enough
still
considering
how
much
is
paid
for
keeping
them
quiet
but
then
if
a
great
crime
is
committed
or
a
gang
of
scoundrels
formed
for
robbing
and
plundering
honest
men
months
go
by
before
these
men
in
the
blue
coats
find
out
anything
about
it
as
henry
hayley
knew
very
little
of
the
affairs
of
the
london
police
he
did
not
enter
into
the
question
of
its
efficiency
with
his
worthy
companion
and
still
conversing
though
upon
other
subjects
they
walked
on
more
quickly
after
they
had
reached
the
summit
of
the
rise
passed
the
of
payne
and
soon
after
entered
upon
another
heath
more
wild
and
than
the
first
the
sun
had
by
this
time
set
but
they
had
yet
full
of
the
long
twilight
of
northern
lands
before
them
and
the
rich
purple
tints
of
the
whole
landscape
were
a
compensation
in
the
eyes
of
one
at
least
of
the
two
for
the
brighter
beams
of
the
day
passing
onward
across
the
heath
the
grey
shades
of
night
gaining
perceptibly
upon
the
lingering
light
they
came
suddenly
upon
the
edge
of
a
small
sandpit
from
which
was
rising
up
a
glare
that
tinged
with
red
the
thick
bushes
of
gorse
near
the
edge
both
henry
and
the
pedlar
stopped
and
looked
over
when
certainly
greatly
to
the
surprise
of
the
former
a
group
was
seen
seated
round
a
good
warm
fire
engaged
in
an
occupation
perhaps
the
least
to
be
expected
in
the
world
at
such
a
spot
and
in
such
circumstances
the
party
was
composed
of
three
a
man
of
or
years
of
age
another
of
four
or
and
a
but
rather
robust
young
woman
of
six
or
some
kettles
and
pots
a
pair
of
bellows
and
various
other
articles
of
the
tinker
trade
with
a
bundle
apparently
of
clothes
sufficiently
denoted
the
calling
of
the
party
but
that
which
was
worthy
of
admiration
and
surprise
was
as
i
have
said
the
occupation
in
which
they
were
engaged
the
young
woman
was
seated
by
the
side
of
the
younger
man
her
head
resting
on
his
shoulder
and
her
arm
thrown
carelessly
across
his
knee
but
her
eyes
as
well
as
his
were
fixed
upon
their
elder
companion
who
sitting
with
his
back
against
the
bank
and
his
knees
drawn
up
so
as
to
form
a
sort
of
desk
was
reading
to
them
out
of
a
large
quarto
volume
very
neatly
covered
with
green
baize
the
clear
strong
voice
rose
up
distinctly
and
henry
heard
a
part
of
the
eighteenth
chapter
of
matthew
he
would
willingly
have
listened
long
for
there
was
something
which
seemed
to
him
so
fine
and
touching
in
the
sounds
of
those
holy
words
read
by
such
a
man
in
such
a
situation
that
the
exquisite
beauty
and
sublimity
of
the
truths
there
written
seemed
to
acquire
if
possible
a
deeper
force
than
when
read
in
the
crowded
church
or
even
in
the
solemn
cathedral
for
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
name
there
am
i
in
the
midst
of
them
read
the
poor
man
below
and
henry
thought
surely
it
is
so
even
here
but
his
companion
who
did
not
understand
the
feelings
which
had
been
excited
by
the
sounds
interrupted
the
reading
with
little
reverence
saying
aloud
ah
master
barnes
is
that
you
how
is
it
that
you
are
not
at
and
so
near
the
barn
is
quite
full
said
the
old
man
as
they
all
looked
up
and
so
we
came
here
we
shall
do
very
well
and
master
slade
was
very
sorry
he
could
take
us
in
and
gave
us
some
milk
to
make
up
so
that
something
how
do
you
do
james
said
the
pedlar
nodding
to
the
younger
man
i
say
if
any
fellows
should
come
and
ask
if
you
have
seen
us
and
which
way
we
have
gone
tell
them
we
have
taken
to
the
right
i
half
like
the
looks
of
things
under
why
i
saw
two
men
go
down
through
the
gully
there
about
five
minutes
ago
said
the
younger
man
i
do
know
who
they
were
strangers
i
think
but
i
tell
them
what
you
say
if
i
see
any
one
go
on
father
i
want
to
hear
that
out
henry
hayley
and
the
pedlar
walked
on
and
very
naturally
the
former
inquired
into
the
history
and
character
of
the
persons
he
had
just
seen
they
are
very
good
respectable
people
said
the
pedlar
who
was
more
a
man
of
thought
than
of
feeling
the
father
has
travelled
this
country
for
a
great
many
years
mending
pots
and
kettles
and
all
kinds
of
tinware
he
always
charges
the
same
sum
which
is
moderate
bad
times
or
good
and
is
supposed
to
be
quite
rich
enough
to
lodge
at
a
if
he
liked
it
but
he
never
sets
his
foot
in
one
of
them
and
the
farmers
are
all
generally
well
content
to
give
him
lodging
in
a
barn
or
for
they
are
certain
that
there
will
be
no
pilfering
at
the
farm
that
night
when
he
ca
get
such
accommodation
he
passes
the
night
anywhere
in
a
copse
or
in
a
sandpit
as
you
have
seen
just
now
he
always
goes
to
church
on
a
sunday
in
a
good
clean
suit
and
the
other
tinkers
and
trampers
call
him
barnes
the
young
man
is
his
and
i
can
assure
you
sir
his
daughter
was
as
much
courted
as
if
she
had
been
a
great
lady
but
the
old
gentleman
would
not
let
her
marry
if
she
had
been
inclined
which
she
did
not
seem
to
be
till
he
found
a
man
to
his
mind
and
i
will
say
james
staples
promises
to
be
just
such
another
as
himself
we
are
not
far
from
graves
farm
now
you
can
see
the
chimneys
up
there
just
over
the
trees
imagination
or
memory
must
have
helped
the
worthy
pedlar
for
henry
hayley
could
see
nothing
at
any
distance
and
it
was
in
fact
quite
dark
the
only
objects
visible
were
two
rows
of
trees
one
on
either
side
of
the
lane
they
were
entering
and
some
stars
peeping
out
in
the
sky
above
once
through
the
trees
indeed
the
young
gentleman
thought
he
caught
the
glimmer
of
a
light
probably
in
a
cottage
window
and
being
somewhat
impatient
to
arrive
at
least
so
far
on
the
way
as
the
house
of
graves
henry
strode
forward
a
little
in
advance
of
the
pedlar
as
in
the
lane
there
seemed
no
probability
of
missing
the
road
they
had
proceeded
thus
for
the
distance
of
about
a
third
of
a
mile
when
the
young
gentleman
suddenly
stopped
and
turned
round
on
hearing
a
sort
of
choking
cry
behind
him
and
he
had
just
time
in
the
dim
and
obscure
light
of
the
night
to
see
two
men
pulling
the
pedlar
backwards
by
the
leathern
strap
which
supported
his
pack
when
he
himself
received
a
violent
blow
on
the
head
from
a
thick
stick
which
made
him
stagger
and
fall
against
the
bank
he
had
heard
no
one
approach
for
the
lane
was
sandy
and
the
light
sound
of
their
own
footfalls
was
all
that
met
the
ears
of
the
travellers
the
fire
flashed
from
henry
eyes
and
his
brain
reeled
with
the
blow
he
had
received
but
he
was
accustomed
to
perils
of
all
kinds
and
while
two
of
the
assailants
were
engaged
apparently
in
plundering
the
pedlar
of
his
pack
he
sprang
upon
the
third
as
soon
as
he
regained
his
feet
closed
with
him
at
once
and
by
an
exertion
of
his
great
strength
had
mastered
him
and
thrown
him
down
when
a
fourth
man
leaped
from
the
bank
above
and
cast
himself
at
once
upon
the
young
soldier
the
contest
would
not
have
been
so
unequal
even
then
as
it
might
have
seemed
for
henry
was
a
far
more
powerful
man
than
either
of
his
assailants
but
one
of
the
others
who
had
been
engaged
with
the
pedlar
left
his
companion
to
hold
the
wandering
merchant
down
and
hastened
to
join
the
affray
which
was
going
on
a
few
steps
farther
forward
it
still
took
the
whole
of
their
united
efforts
to
master
a
man
of
great
natural
strength
rendered
available
in
a
moment
by
the
habit
of
robust
exercises
but
he
was
at
length
brought
to
the
ground
by
a
tremendous
blow
of
a
stick
and
for
a
moment
or
two
lay
unconscious
of
all
that
was
passing
around
when
henry
hayley
revived
to
a
sense
of
what
was
going
on
about
him
he
found
his
head
supported
on
somebody
knee
and
a
pair
of
hands
at
his
throat
busily
untying
his
black
handkerchief
nature
has
an
instinctive
abhorrence
of
being
meddled
with
in
places
whence
the
road
to
the
is
short
and
especially
about
the
throat
so
that
henry
first
impulse
was
to
raise
himself
as
well
as
he
could
and
thrust
away
the
busy
hands
it
all
right
said
the
voice
of
the
pedlar
he
coming
to
thank
you
james
thank
you
if
you
had
not
taken
it
into
your
head
to
follow
us
the
blackguards
would
have
done
for
us
that
clear
enough
i
feel
the
squeeze
of
that
fellow
knee
upon
my
breastbone
now
but
who
is
the
other
man
who
came
with
you
and
who
gone
to
look
after
them
it
is
john
wirling
one
of
graves
men
said
a
voice
which
henry
remembered
and
then
it
added
addressing
him
well
sir
how
are
you
getting
on
now
you
have
spoiled
one
of
the
rogues
anyhow
for
he
ran
as
if
he
could
hardly
get
along
i
should
not
wonder
if
john
caught
him
i
hope
he
wo
try
said
the
pedlar
though
they
got
my
pack
but
they
turn
on
him
to
a
certainty
no
no
here
he
comes
with
a
giddy
and
aching
head
henry
hayley
now
raised
himself
from
the
ground
and
all
that
had
happened
after
he
was
stunned
was
explained
to
him
in
a
few
moments
seeing
some
men
walking
rapidly
after
the
travellers
and
knowing
that
two
others
had
gone
on
before
the
younger
of
the
two
tinkers
whom
he
had
seen
in
the
sandpit
had
followed
as
fast
as
possible
getting
the
assistance
of
a
labouring
man
as
he
went
they
had
come
up
just
as
the
villains
were
rifling
henry
pockets
and
had
scared
them
from
their
work
before
it
was
completed
as
the
man
who
took
upon
himself
the
task
of
explanation
concluded
henry
suddenly
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
with
an
exclamation
of
alarm
the
next
moment
he
withdrew
it
saying
they
have
stolen
my
full
of
valuable
papers
i
will
give
a
hundred
guineas
to
any
one
who
recovers
it
i
would
rather
that
they
had
taken
all
i
have
in
the
world
than
that
that
is
unlucky
indeed
sir
exclaimed
the
pedlar
but
if
it
has
got
nothing
but
papers
in
it
perhaps
we
may
get
it
back
it
contains
nothing
but
papers
and
those
only
valuable
to
myself
replied
henry
they
have
left
my
purse
which
i
should
have
cared
little
about
and
taken
that
which
it
is
impossible
to
replace
well
sir
leave
it
to
me
said
the
pedlar
i
marked
one
of
the
men
well
and
i
see
if
we
can
not
get
it
for
i
know
somewhat
of
these
people
ways
as
you
may
have
seen
by
what
i
told
you
and
now
sir
we
had
better
trot
on
if
you
are
going
to
graves
for
had
a
bad
knock
on
the
head
and
may
as
well
have
something
done
for
it
whoever
obtains
that
for
me
with
its
contents
shall
have
a
hundred
guineas
for
his
pains
and
all
that
he
expends
shall
be
paid
repeated
henry
and
after
having
given
his
address
at
a
hotel
in
london
to
the
two
men
who
had
come
up
to
his
assistance
and
bestowed
on
them
a
considerable
part
of
the
money
in
his
purse
he
followed
his
guide
with
a
slow
step
and
an
anxious
and
thoughtful
air
chapter
xvii
an
old
brick
house
of
a
good
size
with
a
little
green
court
in
front
stood
before
henry
hayley
and
the
pedlar
at
the
end
of
the
lane
across
the
court
which
was
surrounded
by
low
walls
was
a
narrow
gravel
path
leading
from
a
little
gate
in
the
wall
to
the
door
of
the
house
and
on
each
side
of
this
path
was
a
range
of
which
had
formerly
been
cut
into
a
thousand
strange
and
fantastic
shapes
according
to
the
principles
of
the
topiarian
art
an
art
long
now
disused
in
this
our
land
of
england
for
many
years
it
is
true
the
shears
and
the
had
not
been
used
on
the
venerable
yews
and
the
cocks
and
hens
and
obelisks
and
pyramids
which
they
had
once
represented
had
now
burgeoned
and
sprouted
still
leaving
some
fantastic
degree
of
resemblance
to
the
animal
or
thing
first
represented
in
the
midst
of
the
efforts
of
nature
to
restore
the
native
form
of
the
tree
by
this
time
the
pale
edge
of
the
moon
was
rising
over
the
flat
lines
of
the
common
which
lay
below
and
the
gleam
shone
through
the
intervals
between
the
trees
paving
the
little
avenue
with
chequered
light
and
shade
along
this
varied
pathway
henry
hayley
was
pursuing
his
course
when
the
pedlar
touched
his
arm
saying
you
had
better
let
me
go
first
sir
master
graves
is
a
difficult
man
to
deal
with
for
a
stranger
but
i
have
known
him
for
many
years
and
can
manage
him
i
think
henry
suffered
him
to
lead
the
way
and
advancing
towards
the
door
of
the
house
which
was
sheltered
from
the
winds
by
a
projecting
porch
with
a
peaked
roof
the
man
struck
a
single
blow
with
a
large
iron
knocker
consisting
of
a
single
bar
thicker
at
one
end
than
the
other
somewhat
like
the
pestle
of
a
mortar
they
had
not
waited
when
the
door
was
suddenly
thrown
open
and
the
master
of
the
house
himself
appeared
before
them
he
was
a
very
tall
man
perhaps
six
feet
two
or
six
feet
three
in
height
with
a
forehead
equally
broad
and
high
rising
from
a
pair
of
shaggy
white
eyebrows
the
crown
of
his
head
was
completely
bald
and
the
hair
upon
the
temples
and
at
the
back
though
curling
lightly
was
as
white
as
snow
his
frame
must
once
have
been
very
powerful
and
the
broad
shoulders
and
limbs
seemed
still
not
in
the
least
affected
by
time
although
he
must
have
been
very
nearly
seventy
years
of
age
his
hand
was
thin
and
bony
and
his
skin
somewhat
wrinkled
his
teeth
however
were
very
fine
and
his
dark
eyes
as
bright
and
clear
as
ever
time
had
not
certainly
bent
him
with
his
iron
hand
though
it
had
thinned
his
flowing
hair
for
he
stood
straight
and
upright
rolling
his
eyes
for
a
moment
from
the
face
of
the
pedlar
to
that
of
the
stranger
behind
him
and
then
demanded
in
a
loud
stern
tone
what
do
you
want
you
forget
me
master
graves
said
the
pedlar
though
i
have
often
sold
you
many
a
little
thing
and
you
always
owned
that
my
wares
proved
good
i
do
forget
you
joshua
answered
the
farmer
sharply
i
never
forget
but
what
do
you
want
at
this
time
of
night
and
who
is
that
he
is
a
gentleman
to
whom
i
was
showing
his
way
graves
said
the
pedlar
hastily
seeing
that
henry
was
about
to
answer
for
himself
we
were
attacked
and
robbed
by
four
men
down
at
the
end
of
the
lane
they
have
taken
my
pack
and
the
gentleman
and
had
very
nearly
killed
him
into
the
bargain
for
he
had
to
fight
three
of
them
while
one
held
me
down
i
thought
he
was
dead
for
that
matter
for
two
or
three
minutes
but
he
was
only
stunned
by
the
beating
about
the
head
and
so
i
brought
him
on
here
for
i
was
quite
sure
you
would
never
refuse
to
let
us
rest
a
bit
after
what
has
happened
you
know
joshua
i
never
receive
visiters
replied
the
farmer
gazing
first
at
one
and
then
the
other
with
evident
hesitation
if
men
want
to
speak
with
me
on
business
they
can
find
me
at
the
market
in
the
fields
or
in
the
if
they
want
to
speak
of
anything
else
but
business
they
had
better
not
speak
to
me
at
all
well
sir
said
the
pedlar
in
a
tone
of
grave
reproach
i
did
not
think
that
of
you
but
we
can
go
elsewhere
henry
felt
inclined
to
interpose
for
he
did
not
intend
to
go
elsewhere
if
he
could
help
it
but
the
farmer
who
was
better
understood
by
his
old
acquaintance
replied
more
kindly
to
this
appeal
no
no
joshua
he
answered
i
did
not
say
that
i
will
not
be
wanting
in
hospitality
england
was
famous
for
it
when
englishmen
were
honest
and
man
could
trust
man
and
i
will
keep
to
it
still
though
those
times
have
gone
by
i
must
break
through
my
rule
come
in
come
in
sir
you
shall
be
welcome
though
there
are
few
feet
that
have
ever
crossed
that
threshold
for
years
thus
saying
and
telling
the
pedlar
to
shut
the
door
after
him
and
bolt
it
he
led
the
way
into
a
small
on
the
right
hand
side
henry
followed
him
and
when
he
entered
the
room
the
farmer
still
holding
a
candle
in
his
hand
gazed
at
him
gravely
from
head
to
foot
with
a
deliberate
meditating
look
he
seemed
struck
with
his
guest
appearance
but
after
a
moment
as
if
conscious
that
his
stare
was
rude
he
said
i
should
think
few
men
would
like
to
deal
with
you
sir
you
must
be
nearly
as
tall
as
i
am
and
a
great
deal
stronger
now
i
am
upwards
of
six
feet
replied
henry
and
not
easily
overpowered
in
the
daylight
i
think
i
could
have
matched
all
three
but
in
the
darkness
i
could
not
see
whence
the
blows
came
that
a
bad
knock
upon
your
forehead
there
said
the
farmer
sit
down
sir
and
i
make
the
old
woman
bring
you
some
vinegar
you
seem
one
who
would
not
like
to
carry
a
great
black
lump
on
his
forehead
about
the
world
there
a
worse
wound
on
the
back
of
my
head
replied
the
young
gentleman
seating
himself
i
believe
it
would
have
fractured
my
skull
but
fortunately
my
hair
is
very
thick
let
me
look
at
the
wound
said
the
farmer
i
understand
something
about
those
things
and
holding
down
the
candle
he
parted
the
large
curls
of
the
young
gentleman
hair
and
as
he
did
so
henry
heard
him
murmur
i
never
saw
any
but
one
who
had
hair
like
that
nor
i
either
said
the
pedlar
who
was
standing
close
at
his
elbow
and
caught
the
sound
of
the
words
likewise
ha
exclaimed
the
former
starting
up
to
his
full
height
and
gazing
at
the
man
with
a
look
of
surprise
do
you
recollect
her
then
to
be
sure
i
do
replied
the
other
in
a
calm
and
quiet
tone
i
shall
never
forget
her
as
long
as
i
live
nor
her
beautiful
hair
either
it
was
so
thick
so
soft
and
so
dark
except
when
the
light
fell
upon
it
and
then
it
was
like
gold
i
put
it
in
a
comb
for
her
once
i
recollect
quite
well
the
tears
rolled
from
the
old
man
eyes
and
going
hurriedly
to
the
door
he
called
aloud
madge
madge
bring
some
vinegar
here
and
some
of
the
balsam
he
remained
looking
down
the
passage
for
about
a
minute
and
when
he
returned
the
tears
were
gone
when
the
vinegar
and
the
balsam
were
brought
by
a
apparently
nearly
as
old
as
himself
he
applied
his
remedies
with
his
own
hands
and
often
in
doing
so
he
muttered
something
to
himself
but
taking
care
that
what
he
now
said
should
not
be
heard
when
he
had
done
he
sat
down
and
gazed
very
earnestly
at
countenance
speaking
however
at
the
same
time
as
if
to
cover
the
scrutiny
he
was
making
and
so
sir
you
have
lost
your
he
said
was
it
very
valuable
it
contained
things
to
me
of
the
utmost
value
replied
henry
a
paper
that
can
never
be
replaced
and
a
lock
of
my
poor
mother
hair
which
i
have
carried
over
almost
all
the
world
with
me
is
she
living
or
dead
asked
the
farmer
with
a
good
deal
of
agitation
in
his
tone
dead
replied
the
young
gentleman
she
died
almost
immediately
after
my
birth
now
years
ago
farmer
graves
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
but
he
answered
looking
up
towards
the
ceiling
it
must
be
found
that
it
must
be
recovered
i
have
offered
a
reward
of
a
hundred
guineas
to
any
one
who
will
bring
it
to
me
replied
the
young
gentleman
for
one
of
your
men
and
a
man
from
the
common
came
to
help
us
graves
when
we
were
attacked
otherwise
i
believe
we
should
both
have
been
murdered
i
think
i
can
get
it
back
said
the
pedlar
my
own
pack
is
gone
for
ever
but
that
a
small
matter
what
will
you
take
sir
said
the
farmer
abruptly
still
looking
at
henry
i
should
think
a
little
tea
is
the
best
thing
for
you
if
you
please
replied
the
young
gentleman
but
i
think
i
must
soon
go
on
no
no
said
the
farmer
warmly
you
had
a
great
deal
better
stay
here
for
there
the
room
my
son
sometimes
has
it
can
be
got
ready
for
you
in
a
minute
and
i
contrive
to
lodge
friend
joshua
here
i
never
thought
to
let
two
strange
men
into
my
house
again
but
now
i
am
glad
i
did
not
shut
you
out
why
so
demanded
henry
with
a
grave
smile
there
do
look
so
cried
the
farmer
turning
away
his
head
you
put
me
more
and
more
in
mind
of
her
every
minute
young
gentleman
he
continued
laying
his
large
hand
upon
henry
arm
you
think
me
very
strange
i
dare
say
and
i
am
strange
misfortunes
have
made
me
strange
but
i
tell
you
why
i
shut
all
men
out
up
to
this
day
and
why
i
am
glad
i
have
not
shut
out
you
i
was
once
as
glad
to
see
my
as
any
one
and
i
let
one
man
into
my
house
a
stranger
to
me
as
you
may
be
a
gentleman
too
who
paid
me
a
high
price
for
a
horse
i
had
to
sell
and
was
rich
and
smart
in
his
apparel
i
let
him
in
i
say
and
he
stole
away
the
most
precious
thing
i
had
he
broke
my
heart
sir
and
turned
my
brain
and
i
have
never
let
another
in
within
these
doors
till
now
but
you
know
master
graves
said
the
pedlar
that
he
did
not
do
you
the
wrong
that
you
once
thought
so
that
should
be
some
consolation
to
you
yes
yes
i
was
wrong
said
the
old
man
hastily
i
wronged
him
and
i
wronged
my
poor
girl
too
by
my
suspicions
but
yet
what
could
i
think
as
she
was
his
wife
why
could
he
acknowledge
her
as
his
wife
but
she
was
his
wife
i
saw
the
certificate
with
my
own
eyes
she
showed
it
me
when
she
was
dying
have
you
got
it
inquired
henry
hayley
in
as
calm
a
tone
as
he
could
assume
no
replied
the
farmer
i
rushed
out
of
the
house
like
a
madman
and
came
back
here
as
soon
as
the
last
breath
was
drawn
i
could
not
wait
to
put
her
in
the
earth
to
see
the
dust
shovelled
upon
the
head
of
my
poor
beautiful
mary
i
came
away
at
once
and
when
i
came
back
it
was
all
over
the
house
empty
and
the
poor
child
too
gone
there
was
a
dead
silence
for
several
minutes
and
then
henry
said
in
a
low
tone
you
should
not
think
too
hardly
of
her
husband
there
might
be
many
most
important
motives
to
lead
him
to
conceal
his
marriage
at
all
events
you
should
forgive
as
you
would
be
forgiven
i
do
forgive
answered
the
old
man
i
have
long
forgiven
but
there
has
been
a
bitter
tree
planted
in
my
heart
which
bears
its
fruit
still
and
now
young
gentleman
let
me
ask
your
name
for
you
are
so
strangely
like
my
own
dear
girl
that
i
feel
glad
i
have
opened
those
doors
to
you
i
have
always
had
a
notion
that
before
i
die
i
shall
see
my
poor
mary
boy
and
though
i
know
that
the
name
the
man
took
was
a
false
one
yet
i
caught
a
sight
of
the
real
one
in
the
certificate
and
i
should
recollect
it
if
your
name
came
somewhat
near
i
looked
at
it
but
little
it
is
true
in
that
terrible
hour
but
still
i
think
i
should
remember
henry
paused
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
replied
i
am
called
frank
middleton
but
we
will
talk
more
about
this
graves
hereafter
tor
there
are
some
strange
circumstances
connected
with
my
own
birth
too
at
present
i
feel
rather
giddy
i
forgot
i
forgot
said
the
old
man
we
will
have
the
tea
and
talk
more
it
is
almost
too
much
for
my
head
and
must
be
too
much
for
yours
he
rang
the
bell
as
he
spoke
and
then
returning
to
the
subject
which
he
seemed
to
find
a
difficulty
in
leaving
he
said
where
were
you
brought
up
sir
principally
upon
the
continent
replied
henry
in
italy
and
spain
and
for
some
time
in
mexico
ay
he
was
a
merchant
said
the
old
man
and
would
have
the
means
of
sending
the
boy
abroad
but
middleton
that
was
not
the
name
i
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
my
father
real
name
was
not
middleton
replied
henry
though
that
is
the
name
i
have
gone
by
for
many
years
and
perhaps
by
inquiring
we
could
discover
more
however
morning
will
be
time
enough
the
last
sentence
was
uttered
as
the
old
came
in
with
the
tea
which
from
her
master
habits
she
judged
was
the
object
of
his
ringing
the
bell
she
had
brought
but
one
cup
however
for
never
having
seen
a
human
creature
entertained
in
that
room
she
did
not
seem
to
grasp
the
possibility
of
two
strangers
being
invited
to
share
farmer
graves
meal
his
orders
were
given
however
to
bring
more
cups
and
saucers
and
more
bread
and
butter
and
prepare
two
rooms
for
the
accommodation
of
his
unexpected
guests
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
henry
inquired
in
the
same
quiet
and
low
tone
which
he
had
studiously
used
if
graves
was
acquainted
with
the
name
of
the
church
at
which
his
daughter
had
been
married
the
old
man
shook
his
head
no
no
he
replied
no
i
did
not
remark
the
name
but
they
were
living
then
at
least
she
had
been
living
at
a
small
village
in
hertfordshire
a
little
beyond
harrow
not
much
above
ten
miles
from
london
and
i
think
i
understood
that
they
had
been
there
ever
since
she
left
me
ah
poor
thing
poor
thing
she
little
knew
what
she
was
doing
when
she
quitted
her
father
house
god
help
and
forgive
us
all
but
as
you
say
we
had
better
not
talk
more
about
it
i
feel
the
well
of
bitterness
pouring
forth
all
its
waters
again
and
yet
when
i
look
at
your
face
it
seems
to
carry
me
back
for
nearly
thirty
years
and
i
can
hardly
think
my
child
dead
and
gone
in
the
cold
grave
she
who
was
all
life
and
brightness
while
i
am
left
here
upon
the
sunny
face
of
the
earth
like
a
withered
leaf
in
a
day
there
do
let
us
talk
any
more
of
it
henry
judged
that
it
might
be
better
not
to
press
the
conversation
any
farther
and
indeed
he
wished
in
some
degree
to
collect
his
own
thoughts
and
to
determine
fully
upon
his
course
of
action
before
he
did
so
that
he
was
in
the
house
of
his
mother
father
he
was
well
aware
but
he
had
entertained
no
idea
that
his
resemblance
to
his
mother
was
so
great
as
at
once
to
awaken
suspicion
of
the
fact
in
the
mind
of
the
old
man
himself
he
had
consequently
prepared
in
no
degree
for
such
a
contingency
and
he
was
well
pleased
to
have
time
for
consideration
in
regard
to
the
next
step
which
he
should
take
to
avow
his
real
name
and
at
once
give
graves
an
explanation
of
all
the
circumstances
did
not
as
the
reader
may
conceive
enter
at
all
into
his
plans
but
yet
he
feared
that
the
discovery
of
so
great
a
likeness
would
render
the
task
of
getting
full
information
from
the
old
man
more
difficult
than
he
had
at
first
imagined
he
contented
himself
therefore
during
the
evening
with
studying
his
character
it
was
not
very
difficult
to
comprehend
indeed
frank
straightforward
and
decided
but
yet
kindly
and
affectionate
the
apparent
sternness
proceeded
more
from
rapidity
of
thought
and
feeling
than
from
any
real
harshness
perhaps
after
all
thought
henry
towards
the
close
of
the
evening
i
have
obtained
as
much
information
from
the
good
old
man
as
he
is
able
to
give
and
although
in
the
future
i
shall
certainly
tell
him
the
whole
perhaps
the
best
way
at
present
may
be
to
leave
him
ignorant
of
any
further
particulars
till
i
can
clear
away
all
clouds
at
once
the
farmer
seemed
very
willing
to
give
him
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
for
till
they
retired
to
rest
he
studiously
avoided
all
further
reference
to
the
subject
which
had
already
engrossed
so
much
of
their
time
that
he
was
thinking
of
it
still
was
apparent
for
he
often
fell
into
deep
reveries
but
he
made
an
effort
to
find
other
topics
of
conversation
and
henry
was
surprised
to
find
that
in
speaking
of
books
or
arts
he
was
by
no
means
an
illiterate
or
person
he
seemed
to
have
taken
a
delight
in
studying
the
older
english
poets
he
had
not
only
that
general
knowledge
of
english
history
which
is
sufficient
to
carry
a
man
through
ordinary
conversation
or
through
the
house
of
commons
where
facts
or
quotations
garbled
and
perverted
are
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
party
and
very
little
likely
to
be
exposed
especially
if
delivered
with
emphasis
and
the
reputation
of
a
good
memory
but
he
had
also
that
thorough
and
minute
acquaintance
with
particular
periods
of
history
which
very
few
men
possess
but
which
is
absolutely
necessary
to
all
who
would
view
philosophically
the
motives
deeds
and
results
of
past
times
and
see
their
bearings
upon
the
state
of
society
at
present
at
a
very
early
hour
for
one
accustomed
to
courts
and
cities
henry
received
an
intimation
from
his
host
that
the
usual
period
of
rest
at
his
house
was
come
the
old
two
or
three
other
women
and
several
labouring
men
were
called
in
and
the
good
farmer
producing
a
small
volume
from
a
cupboard
read
several
short
prayers
to
his
household
and
dismissed
them
to
repose
he
then
led
henry
to
the
room
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
provided
him
with
whatever
articles
of
apparel
he
might
need
and
when
turning
to
leave
him
held
up
his
hand
with
the
air
and
look
of
a
patriarch
saying
god
bless
you
young
man
and
watch
over
you
during
the
night
i
do
believe
that
my
child
blood
flows
in
your
veins
if
not
fortune
has
strangely
sent
you
to
renew
and
yet
to
soften
the
memories
of
the
past
chapter
xviii
love
often
keeps
men
awake
knocks
on
the
head
will
have
the
same
effect
if
they
be
not
too
hard
when
they
sometimes
prove
very
soporific
and
agitating
thoughts
of
any
kind
with
the
generality
of
mortals
have
the
same
tendency
it
is
not
always
so
indeed
for
i
know
some
people
who
when
they
are
very
unhappy
or
very
anxious
go
sound
to
sleep
they
are
wise
it
is
the
best
thing
they
can
do
nevertheless
although
henry
hayley
was
not
one
of
the
latter
class
was
in
love
had
received
two
severe
blows
on
the
head
and
had
had
a
great
many
strong
emotions
within
him
he
slept
very
soundly
for
he
was
weary
and
exhausted
there
is
something
too
in
habit
for
the
mind
is
very
much
more
like
the
body
than
we
imagine
and
either
will
learn
to
bear
almost
anything
by
custom
if
it
be
not
sufficiently
strong
to
break
down
all
powers
of
resistance
at
first
now
henry
had
in
the
course
of
his
life
gone
through
so
many
agitating
moments
and
had
so
frequently
encountered
difficulty
danger
and
distress
that
he
bore
them
now
more
lightly
than
most
men
gave
to
thought
the
time
due
to
thought
and
to
repose
the
time
necessary
for
refreshment
thus
as
i
have
said
he
slept
soundly
and
well
till
daylight
on
the
following
morning
and
he
had
just
raised
himself
on
his
arm
and
was
looking
at
the
sunshine
playing
with
the
white
dimity
curtains
of
the
windows
when
he
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
he
said
and
his
friend
the
pedlar
appeared
good
morning
sir
said
the
man
i
have
just
come
up
for
a
minute
while
farmer
graves
is
out
to
have
a
chat
with
you
upon
what
happened
last
night
i
do
mean
about
the
robbery
but
about
the
marriage
and
all
that
now
joshua
brown
was
somewhat
forcibly
in
possession
of
a
portion
of
henry
hayley
confidence
i
say
forcibly
because
our
young
friend
was
not
a
man
to
entrust
his
affairs
to
the
discretion
of
a
wandering
pedlar
whom
he
had
only
known
for
a
few
hours
although
all
that
he
had
seen
of
him
was
favourable
but
the
pedlar
having
been
present
when
so
much
had
passed
regarding
his
early
history
had
that
degree
of
command
of
the
story
which
rendered
it
a
nice
point
of
discretion
whether
he
should
be
told
more
or
not
henry
resolved
to
see
farther
however
before
he
decided
and
to
allow
the
man
to
take
the
lead
maintaining
for
his
own
part
what
may
be
called
the
defensive
in
the
conversation
well
my
good
friend
he
said
in
reply
it
is
a
very
curious
circumstance
that
this
good
farmer
should
see
so
strong
a
likeness
between
myself
and
his
daughter
i
do
know
sir
said
the
pedlar
that
is
as
it
may
be
that
you
are
very
like
her
is
certain
for
i
remember
her
well
and
if
you
do
not
know
who
your
mother
was
it
is
just
as
likely
that
she
was
your
mother
as
any
other
woman
this
proposition
henry
did
not
think
fit
to
contradict
and
the
next
moment
the
pedlar
went
a
step
farther
saying
besides
sir
i
rather
think
that
you
must
yourself
have
some
cause
to
believe
that
you
are
this
poor
young
lady
child
because
although
farmer
graves
from
the
way
i
took
with
him
does
not
know
anything
about
it
i
know
that
you
came
over
seeking
him
i
might
have
a
thousand
other
things
to
talk
to
him
about
replied
henry
although
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
this
was
a
well
sir
answered
the
pedlar
i
do
not
want
to
pry
into
your
affairs
it
is
not
curiosity
or
anything
of
that
kind
that
makes
me
speak
but
i
think
i
can
perhaps
help
you
in
what
you
want
that
is
to
say
if
i
am
right
in
believing
i
know
what
you
do
want
if
you
will
tell
me
what
you
suppose
me
to
want
replied
henry
hayley
i
will
at
once
answer
you
yes
or
no
and
will
moreover
ask
you
a
few
questions
in
return
your
answers
to
which
will
soon
satisfy
us
both
as
to
whether
you
can
afford
me
the
assistance
i
require
and
for
the
wish
to
render
which
i
am
very
much
obliged
why
you
see
sir
rejoined
the
man
last
night
you
asked
graves
quite
quietly
whether
he
had
got
the
certificate
and
some
time
after
whether
he
knew
at
what
church
the
marriage
took
place
now
i
fancy
that
your
object
is
to
prove
that
you
are
legitimate
whether
you
may
think
fit
to
acknowledge
your
mother
family
or
not
for
i
can
see
clearly
that
you
have
been
bred
up
as
a
very
high
gentleman
henry
hayley
smiled
my
good
friend
he
said
let
me
assure
you
in
whatsoever
rank
i
may
have
been
brought
up
i
would
never
disclaim
as
relations
good
and
honourable
men
to
whom
i
am
really
tied
by
kindred
blood
a
much
higher
rank
than
ever
i
shall
attain
to
would
not
at
all
justify
such
evil
pride
i
will
acknowledge
however
that
my
object
is
that
which
you
state
and
i
will
reward
any
one
very
handsomely
who
will
enable
me
to
prove
the
marriage
of
miss
graves
i
think
i
can
do
it
sir
said
the
pedlar
rubbing
his
hands
slowly
one
over
the
other
i
do
doubt
it
this
wandering
trade
of
mine
is
one
of
the
best
and
most
interesting
in
the
world
we
see
all
that
happens
round
about
us
in
every
part
of
the
country
hear
a
great
number
of
curious
stories
and
as
we
go
very
quickly
from
one
place
to
another
we
often
get
the
two
ends
of
a
history
which
itself
takes
a
very
long
turn
between
them
and
learn
more
about
it
than
people
who
have
more
to
do
with
it
but
how
do
you
intend
to
act
in
this
instance
demanded
henry
have
you
any
particular
information
not
much
sir
replied
the
man
but
i
will
work
it
out
notwithstanding
i
should
like
to
hear
how
said
the
young
gentleman
raising
himself
higher
in
bed
when
we
were
talking
with
graves
you
seemed
to
have
no
further
information
than
that
which
you
had
previously
given
to
me
and
i
should
be
very
glad
to
hear
what
more
you
know
that
is
hardly
fair
sir
said
the
pedlar
with
a
smile
i
can
assure
you
replied
henry
that
whatever
you
tell
me
will
make
no
difference
whatever
as
to
the
recompense
i
shall
give
if
by
your
means
i
can
prove
the
fact
of
the
marriage
that
is
not
the
point
at
all
sir
answered
joshua
brown
i
am
quite
sure
you
would
behave
like
a
gentleman
i
should
know
a
gentleman
when
i
see
him
i
think
or
i
have
walked
the
world
for
thirty
years
to
no
purpose
but
you
see
sir
there
a
pleasure
in
working
a
thing
of
this
kind
out
by
one
self
it
a
thing
i
very
fond
of
and
often
when
i
see
something
happen
that
i
do
understand
i
set
to
work
to
make
it
out
and
i
get
a
little
bit
of
information
here
and
a
little
bit
there
till
the
whole
thing
is
as
clear
as
possible
i
do
mind
telling
you
this
much
however
if
you
just
let
me
follow
the
string
my
own
way
some
years
ago
it
was
in
the
month
of
august
as
i
was
trudging
along
with
my
box
on
my
shoulders
down
in
hertfordshire
just
about
the
place
where
farmer
graves
told
us
last
night
he
was
sent
for
to
his
daughter
a
passed
me
and
i
saw
in
it
a
face
i
thought
i
knew
it
was
a
woman
face
and
one
not
likely
to
be
forgotten
but
she
had
on
a
white
bonnet
with
a
white
feather
in
it
and
a
white
lace
veil
partly
hanging
down
and
as
i
had
never
seen
the
young
lady
so
dressed
i
was
puzzled
for
a
long
time
to
think
who
it
could
be
i
went
along
saying
is
surely
pretty
mary
graves
but
i
was
not
quite
certain
about
a
mile
farther
on
i
came
to
a
church
and
looking
over
the
wall
of
the
i
saw
the
clerk
or
the
sexton
or
somebody
shutting
the
so
i
hallooed
out
to
him
clerk
do
you
want
anything
in
my
way
he
was
a
sulky
old
fellow
and
he
said
then
i
answered
come
you
want
a
ribbon
for
a
wedding
favour
for
the
two
young
people
who
have
just
passed
who
have
been
tying
the
knot
with
their
tongue
they
can
never
untie
with
their
teeth
so
he
laughed
a
little
at
that
but
he
said
i
do
if
they
had
wanted
me
to
wear
a
favour
they
might
have
given
me
one
then
speaking
quietly
just
as
you
did
last
night
when
asking
about
the
certificate
i
said
who
are
they
master
clerk
but
he
answered
quite
short
that
to
you
and
i
could
get
another
word
out
of
him
for
he
walked
away
some
nine
or
ten
months
after
that
i
came
down
here
i
always
take
these
parts
about
the
end
of
may
or
the
beginning
of
june
and
i
began
to
ask
the
people
questions
i
soon
found
that
mary
graves
had
gone
away
with
a
rich
young
merchant
was
married
to
him
and
was
dead
in
short
i
heard
the
whole
story
that
i
told
you
it
was
two
years
after
that
before
i
saw
her
father
again
but
then
i
found
him
quite
still
do
you
know
the
name
of
the
church
asked
henry
eagerly
no
i
do
not
sir
replied
the
man
but
i
find
it
out
and
see
the
register
for
that
year
only
i
do
know
what
name
to
look
for
mary
graves
of
course
replied
henry
adding
the
moment
after
bring
me
a
certificate
of
her
having
been
married
in
that
year
and
i
will
make
you
a
rich
man
for
the
rest
of
your
life
but
my
good
friend
it
may
be
months
before
you
trace
the
whole
of
this
business
and
from
particular
circumstances
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
ascertain
the
facts
immediately
it
sha
be
long
sir
said
the
pedlar
i
must
go
back
to
london
for
i
have
no
pack
now
and
so
i
travel
light
what
might
be
the
value
of
your
pack
my
good
friend
asked
the
young
gentleman
oh
not
very
much
sir
answered
the
man
for
i
had
sold
a
good
deal
out
of
it
there
were
ten
pair
of
spectacles
some
gold
pins
and
two
or
three
wedding
rings
but
the
whole
was
worth
more
than
nine
pounds
i
think
and
the
box
was
worth
a
pound
more
for
it
was
an
old
one
do
you
think
you
can
get
me
a
pen
and
ink
and
a
sheet
of
paper
oh
certainly
said
the
pedlar
walking
away
and
when
he
returned
he
found
the
young
gentleman
up
and
partly
dressed
i
will
pay
you
for
your
pack
my
good
friend
he
said
as
it
was
lost
in
consequence
of
your
guiding
me
here
i
have
not
got
money
enough
about
me
for
i
gave
the
greater
part
of
what
i
had
to
the
men
who
came
to
help
us
but
a
cheque
upon
my
banker
i
dare
say
will
do
as
well
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
indeed
sir
replied
the
pedlar
though
it
is
scarcely
fair
to
take
it
i
think
henry
however
drew
the
cheque
and
gave
it
to
the
pedlar
whose
eyes
instantly
fixed
upon
the
words
frank
middleton
written
at
the
bottom
a
look
of
some
surprise
came
upon
his
face
evidently
showing
he
had
not
quite
believed
that
the
name
which
had
been
given
to
the
farmer
was
the
real
one
nevertheless
he
made
no
comment
but
only
said
now
sir
will
you
let
me
have
your
address
in
london
i
think
in
three
or
four
days
you
shall
hear
something
more
of
me
henry
gave
his
address
accordingly
at
the
hotel
where
he
was
lodging
and
merely
reading
the
words
colonel
middleton
the
pedlar
seemed
about
to
retire
when
the
young
gentleman
stopped
him
saying
there
is
another
thing
we
have
to
consider
my
good
friend
namely
the
recovery
of
my
for
there
are
some
papers
in
it
of
the
utmost
importance
i
will
put
that
in
train
sir
before
i
go
replied
the
man
and
i
do
mind
telling
you
how
for
you
must
give
me
authority
as
to
trying
to
catch
these
men
and
get
it
from
them
by
force
that
is
out
of
the
question
the
only
way
to
do
is
to
apply
to
some
of
what
they
call
their
bankers
they
call
them
in
london
i
believe
now
i
have
heard
the
names
of
two
or
three
of
these
scoundrels
in
the
different
towns
round
about
and
i
go
to
them
and
tell
them
that
you
will
give
a
hundred
pounds
to
get
the
book
back
again
with
all
it
contains
you
may
say
i
will
give
that
to
the
people
who
have
got
it
replied
henry
and
fifty
pounds
more
to
whichever
of
these
bankers
gets
it
for
me
and
no
inquiries
made
said
the
pedlar
that
will
soon
settle
the
matter
i
think
but
now
i
go
sir
for
there
i
see
farmer
graves
coming
up
the
walk
and
it
as
well
he
should
know
that
we
been
talking
over
these
matters
i
have
not
the
slightest
objection
to
his
knowing
replied
the
young
gentleman
for
it
is
my
intention
to
tell
him
this
morning
a
great
deal
more
concerning
myself
than
i
did
last
night
as
i
think
he
will
now
be
able
to
talk
over
the
matter
more
calmly
he
will
like
your
telling
him
and
his
telling
you
much
better
than
my
having
anything
to
do
with
it
said
the
pedlar
and
therefore
i
had
better
go
sir
a
week
sha
pass
without
your
hearing
from
me
thus
saying
he
quitted
the
room
leaving
henry
to
finish
his
toilet
and
henry
dressed
and
descended
the
large
wide
staircase
which
to
say
the
truth
occupied
nearly
a
third
of
the
whole
house
he
entered
the
room
where
he
had
taken
tea
the
night
before
and
seeing
that
although
it
was
untenanted
the
table
was
laid
for
breakfast
he
sat
down
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
obtaining
a
view
to
the
left
of
the
double
row
of
over
the
top
of
the
neighbouring
copses
to
the
heath
of
which
he
had
traversed
a
part
during
the
preceding
evening
the
country
lay
soft
and
fair
in
the
hazy
morning
light
but
though
henry
eyes
were
fixed
upon
it
he
saw
little
except
that
a
sweet
picture
was
hung
up
before
him
for
his
mind
was
occupied
with
thoughts
too
eager
and
too
active
to
suffer
the
volatile
part
of
the
mind
to
stray
after
the
ordinary
sources
of
enjoyment
he
had
not
much
faith
in
the
success
of
good
joshua
brown
efforts
to
recover
his
lost
and
when
he
came
to
consider
all
that
it
contained
the
necessity
of
regaining
it
became
every
moment
more
and
more
evident
to
his
eyes
there
was
in
it
first
the
paper
given
to
him
by
his
father
immediately
before
he
started
for
the
continent
besides
this
there
was
his
passport
under
the
name
of
frank
middleton
and
there
were
documents
of
various
kinds
which
went
a
great
way
to
establish
the
identity
of
the
person
so
named
with
the
henry
hayley
who
had
fled
from
england
more
than
ten
years
before
whether
the
possession
of
these
papers
would
ever
be
of
any
great
service
to
himself
he
might
doubt
in
the
undecided
state
of
his
mind
as
to
the
course
he
should
pursue
but
yet
he
saw
clearly
that
they
might
be
very
dangerous
in
the
hands
of
another
if
ever
the
person
who
had
possessed
himself
of
them
should
obtain
a
clue
to
the
history
of
the
real
owner
yet
however
much
he
thought
over
the
circumstances
he
could
see
no
better
plan
for
recovering
his
property
than
that
which
had
been
proposed
to
employ
an
officer
of
police
would
have
been
more
dangerous
than
to
leave
it
where
it
was
to
search
for
it
in
person
offered
very
small
prospect
of
success
as
he
was
but
little
aware
of
the
haunts
and
habits
of
the
persons
by
whom
he
had
been
assailed
he
resolved
however
to
consult
the
good
old
fanner
as
to
the
best
means
of
proceeding
and
the
opportunity
was
not
long
wanting
for
in
about
ten
minutes
graves
entered
the
room
he
advanced
towards
henry
with
an
outstretched
hand
and
with
his
eye
fixed
i
must
call
it
anxiously
upon
his
guest
countenance
he
asked
how
he
was
how
he
had
slept
how
his
head
felt
and
he
then
told
him
that
his
guide
of
the
night
before
had
just
departed
he
an
honest
fellow
joshua
brown
said
the
old
man
i
have
dealt
with
him
in
small
things
for
many
years
and
never
found
him
deceive
me
i
would
willingly
have
kept
him
to
breakfast
but
he
would
take
nothing
but
a
slice
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
beer
and
then
posted
off
upon
his
way
i
must
go
very
soon
likewise
replied
henry
but
before
i
go
and
before
breakfast
is
served
let
me
say
one
word
to
you
my
dear
sir
i
have
many
reasons
to
believe
that
we
are
very
near
akin
to
each
other
my
early
history
is
still
a
mystery
in
some
degree
to
myself
but
i
will
now
tell
you
fairly
which
i
did
not
choose
to
do
last
night
that
the
name
of
mary
graves
has
been
mentioned
to
me
once
in
my
life
as
that
of
my
mother
the
old
man
threw
his
arms
round
him
pressed
him
to
his
heart
and
henry
clasped
his
hand
warmly
but
he
said
do
not
let
us
yet
feel
too
sure
graves
i
have
determined
to
investigate
the
whole
matter
to
the
bottom
and
to
discover
all
the
facts
nor
will
i
delay
at
all
in
so
doing
my
father
has
been
dead
some
years
otherwise
the
whole
would
have
been
made
perfectly
clear
before
now
for
many
circumstances
which
i
can
not
well
explain
at
present
prevented
him
during
a
long
period
from
holding
any
communication
with
me
regarding
my
birth
of
this
however
be
assured
graves
that
as
soon
as
ever
all
the
facts
are
in
my
possession
i
will
see
you
again
and
if
it
be
as
i
think
will
gladly
claim
that
connection
with
you
which
my
father
did
not
acknowledge
not
from
any
feeling
of
pride
on
his
part
but
from
motives
so
powerful
that
you
yourself
when
you
hear
them
will
admit
their
force
the
old
man
mused
with
tears
in
his
bright
dark
eyes
they
should
be
powerful
indeed
he
said
to
justify
nay
to
palliate
such
conduct
as
his
but
perhaps
after
all
he
knew
not
how
i
loved
her
perhaps
he
knew
not
the
full
bitterness
of
the
cup
he
forced
me
to
drink
often
have
i
cursed
him
but
i
curse
him
not
now
i
have
learned
to
forgive
and
i
pray
that
god
may
forgive
him
amen
said
henry
every
man
needs
forgiveness
and
he
who
has
caused
another
pain
and
grief
however
it
may
have
happened
requires
it
much
as
he
ended
the
came
in
with
the
materials
for
breakfast
and
he
and
the
old
man
sat
down
together
avoiding
as
if
by
mutual
consent
any
reference
to
the
subject
of
their
previous
conversation
henry
spoke
at
large
however
with
regard
to
his
and
explained
to
graves
as
well
as
he
could
without
describing
the
contents
how
important
it
was
for
him
to
recover
it
i
could
wish
he
added
though
i
do
know
if
it
be
possible
that
it
should
be
restored
to
me
without
being
opened
i
would
not
look
into
the
inside
for
the
world
replied
the
old
man
but
if
it
be
still
within
ten
miles
of
this
place
i
think
i
will
have
it
before
night
for
immediately
after
breakfast
i
will
mount
my
horse
and
i
will
get
all
my
own
men
and
my
son
together
and
will
sweep
the
whole
country
between
this
and
frimley
without
leaving
a
hole
unsearched
in
which
any
one
of
the
villains
could
harbour
but
where
are
you
going
to
now
can
not
you
stay
and
help
us
i
am
afraid
not
replied
henry
i
have
promised
to
be
in
london
but
i
will
write
down
my
address
and
hope
to
hear
from
you
do
write
tell
me
said
the
farmer
that
is
as
good
as
writing
i
never
forget
since
that
terrible
day
it
seems
as
if
everything
that
happens
to
me
is
dug
into
my
memory
as
if
with
a
penknife
like
names
that
boys
carve
on
the
bark
of
trees
the
marks
grow
larger
and
stronger
as
time
passes
these
things
touch
different
men
in
different
ways
i
have
heard
of
some
men
who
have
quite
lost
their
memory
under
misfortunes
with
me
the
effect
has
been
the
reverse
what
is
the
address
when
henry
told
him
he
murmured
colonel
middleton
that
is
not
the
name
i
do
not
believe
it
is
replied
henry
i
do
not
believe
it
is
my
own
name
but
that
will
be
all
explained
to
you
hereafter
and
now
is
it
possible
to
get
a
chaise
to
hartford
bridge
i
left
my
portmanteau
there
last
night
and
must
go
back
for
it
you
can
go
in
my
gig
said
the
old
man
tell
the
people
at
the
lion
to
send
it
back
i
will
order
it
directly
then
go
you
on
your
way
while
i
go
on
mine
and
success
attend
us
both
chapter
xix
maria
monkton
was
dressing
for
dinner
when
she
heard
a
loud
double
knock
at
the
door
of
her
aunt
house
it
wanted
fully
of
the
time
at
which
any
guest
but
a
lover
could
be
reasonably
expected
and
while
she
herself
hurried
her
toilet
she
bade
the
maid
look
out
and
see
who
was
the
visiter
it
is
only
your
uncle
said
the
abigail
it
is
his
cab
and
servant
is
lady
fleetwood
dressed
demanded
maria
rather
anxiously
oh
dear
yes
she
has
been
down
these
ten
minutes
replied
the
maid
setting
hard
to
work
again
upon
her
lady
hair
now
if
maria
had
been
anxious
to
hasten
all
her
proceedings
when
she
thought
that
the
early
guest
was
henry
hayley
she
was
even
more
desirous
of
getting
down
soon
when
she
found
that
it
was
her
uncle
who
had
arrived
not
that
her
love
for
scriven
was
at
all
eager
for
heaven
knows
that
however
affectionate
a
heart
might
be
it
would
have
found
it
a
hard
task
to
love
him
very
warmly
green
ivy
and
blushing
honeysuckle
will
twine
it
is
true
round
a
cold
stiff
post
but
it
would
have
required
a
still
more
clinging
passion
than
even
love
to
make
any
heart
attach
itself
to
scriven
avarice
perhaps
might
do
no
maria
haste
proceeded
from
other
causes
there
was
never
any
telling
what
lady
fleetwood
might
say
or
what
lady
fleetwood
might
do
and
her
niece
very
much
wished
to
prevent
her
from
saying
or
doing
much
with
scriven
that
day
indeed
had
she
been
at
all
aware
that
her
aunt
had
asked
him
to
dinner
maria
would
have
prepared
accordingly
and
gone
to
dress
earlier
but
dear
lady
fleetwood
had
always
her
own
little
secrets
and
as
she
fully
concurred
in
her
brother
desire
that
maria
should
marry
charles
marston
she
had
resolved
to
invite
scriven
without
letting
her
niece
know
anything
of
the
fact
in
order
that
her
own
efforts
both
offensive
and
defensive
might
be
well
seconded
for
charles
who
she
was
afraid
would
fall
in
love
with
maria
and
colonel
middleton
who
she
was
afraid
fall
in
love
with
maria
were
both
to
be
there
at
dinner
perhaps
this
does
not
explain
very
clearly
why
she
kept
the
invitation
secret
from
her
niece
but
the
truth
is
lady
fleetwood
was
afraid
maria
would
dissuade
her
from
sending
it
now
lady
fleetwood
as
the
reader
knows
was
the
most
persuadable
woman
in
the
world
and
she
had
an
internal
consciousness
of
this
sort
of
i
may
as
well
manufacture
another
word
while
i
am
about
it
which
made
her
reluctant
to
expose
that
particular
side
of
her
character
to
the
assault
of
an
antagonist
as
she
wished
very
much
to
have
scriven
there
and
had
determined
that
it
would
be
quite
right
and
proper
so
to
do
and
moreover
as
she
knew
that
maria
could
persuade
her
not
to
ask
him
and
thought
it
very
likely
she
would
do
so
lady
fleetwood
with
a
little
upon
herself
quietly
wrote
a
note
to
her
brother
sent
it
off
in
secret
and
then
was
afraid
to
tell
her
niece
what
she
had
done
till
scriven
was
actually
in
the
house
as
i
have
said
maria
dressed
herself
with
the
utmost
expedition
and
descended
as
fast
as
possible
to
the
she
found
her
aunt
and
uncle
full
tilt
however
in
what
seemed
a
very
interesting
conversation
for
maria
had
rarely
beheld
scriven
face
so
full
of
expression
before
her
entrance
took
place
with
ladylike
grace
just
as
lady
fleetwood
was
finishing
a
sentence
as
like
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
quoth
lady
fleetwood
exactly
the
same
person
only
taller
and
older
maria
saw
it
all
in
a
moment
and
though
she
was
a
good
deal
agitated
and
somewhat
alarmed
by
what
she
did
see
she
composed
herself
as
best
she
might
and
gallantly
hurried
forward
to
the
scene
of
combat
ah
maria
good
evening
said
her
uncle
your
aunt
has
just
been
telling
me
who
are
to
be
her
guests
amongst
them
is
a
colonel
middleton
i
find
a
friend
of
yours
he
brought
me
a
letter
from
charles
replied
maria
struggling
desperately
against
emotion
do
you
know
him
sir
that
would
have
been
scarcely
fair
of
maria
if
it
had
not
been
that
scriven
had
spoken
in
a
tone
which
might
very
fairly
be
interpreted
to
imply
that
he
had
some
acquaintance
with
the
gentleman
of
whom
he
spoke
no
i
do
know
him
at
all
replied
scriven
pray
do
you
see
this
extraordinary
likeness
between
him
and
young
henry
hayley
though
perhaps
you
do
not
recollect
the
lad
for
you
were
but
a
child
when
he
ran
away
oh
yes
i
remember
him
perfectly
replied
maria
in
as
indifferent
a
tone
as
she
could
assume
you
forget
my
dear
uncle
i
was
between
thirteen
and
fourteen
when
he
went
there
is
a
likeness
certainly
though
colonel
middleton
is
darker
in
complexion
and
has
darker
hair
there
are
various
other
differences
too
but
still
i
can
see
the
likeness
which
my
aunt
has
discovered
i
always
doubted
the
story
of
that
boy
death
said
scriven
drily
looking
first
at
his
niece
and
then
at
his
sister
oh
dear
me
how
can
you
fancy
such
a
thing
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
why
the
officer
saw
him
lying
dead
the
officer
never
saw
him
alive
said
scriven
but
you
do
suppose
that
colonel
middleton
is
the
same
exclaimed
his
sister
who
saw
that
she
had
excited
suspicions
which
she
had
not
the
slightest
wish
in
the
world
to
arouse
why
this
gentleman
has
been
all
his
life
in
spain
and
mexico
and
his
mother
i
hear
was
a
spanish
lady
i
suppose
nothing
at
all
replied
scriven
i
never
suppose
anything
but
if
it
were
henry
hayley
he
would
of
course
take
a
different
name
and
fabricate
some
history
for
himself
such
a
one
as
you
have
just
told
is
as
likely
as
any
other
we
will
soon
find
out
however
for
if
he
be
a
spaniard
or
half
a
spaniard
he
must
be
known
to
spaniards
maria
smiled
for
there
she
felt
herself
upon
strong
ground
in
consequence
of
what
henry
had
told
her
you
seem
pleased
or
amused
maria
said
her
uncle
a
little
amused
she
answered
for
poor
henry
hayley
seems
to
be
what
the
french
would
call
your
my
dear
uncle
you
see
him
in
every
bush
however
colonel
middleton
in
conversation
the
other
day
mentioned
the
names
of
a
great
number
of
spanish
gentlemen
with
whom
he
is
acquainted
and
amongst
the
rest
that
of
the
conde
de
fraga
the
secretary
of
the
duke
of
san
carlos
the
ambassador
as
my
aunt
knows
the
young
conde
she
has
invited
him
here
to
meet
colonel
middleton
so
you
will
soon
see
if
they
are
acquainted
scriven
had
just
time
to
say
humph
before
charles
marston
was
announced
then
came
lady
anne
mellent
and
she
was
succeeded
by
colonel
middleton
himself
henry
eye
as
he
entered
the
room
fell
at
once
upon
scriven
but
he
took
not
the
slightest
notice
and
betrayed
no
knowledge
of
him
even
by
a
change
of
expression
he
paid
his
compliments
to
lady
fleetwood
gracefully
and
easily
spoke
for
a
moment
to
lady
anne
in
a
gay
and
laughing
tone
and
then
took
a
chair
by
maria
who
though
standing
before
he
entered
had
seated
herself
immediately
feeling
her
heart
beat
so
violently
that
she
feared
she
should
fall
during
the
whole
of
this
time
and
while
charles
marston
crossed
over
and
shook
hands
with
his
friend
scriven
continued
to
examine
his
sister
guest
with
a
keen
scrutinizing
stare
there
he
was
before
him
tall
handsome
commanding
graceful
dressed
with
the
most
perfect
taste
and
having
a
star
and
a
smaller
order
on
his
left
breast
but
still
very
very
like
what
he
should
have
expected
to
see
in
henry
hayley
had
there
not
been
good
reason
for
believing
him
dead
still
there
was
some
slight
difference
and
perhaps
a
discoloured
mark
upon
the
forehead
left
by
the
blow
he
had
so
lately
received
made
him
less
like
his
former
self
than
he
otherwise
would
have
been
the
young
officer
did
not
seem
to
perceive
the
rude
examination
he
was
undergoing
and
was
giving
a
sketch
of
the
attack
which
had
been
made
upon
him
the
night
before
to
charles
and
maria
when
scriven
touched
his
nephew
arm
saying
charles
you
have
not
introduced
me
to
your
friend
with
perfect
ease
which
showed
that
he
at
least
was
unconscious
of
even
a
likeness
between
colonel
middleton
and
henry
hayley
charles
marston
presented
his
uncle
to
his
aunt
guest
henry
rose
and
bowed
looking
slightly
at
scriven
without
even
a
glance
of
recognition
and
then
proceeded
with
his
tale
scriven
stood
by
and
listened
but
it
was
less
the
words
than
the
tones
he
attended
to
and
they
produced
a
very
strong
effect
voice
as
i
have
said
was
very
peculiar
rich
full
and
exceedingly
melodious
and
the
merchant
felt
almost
sure
that
he
had
heard
those
sounds
before
upon
my
word
marston
said
henry
in
conclusion
you
who
boast
yourselves
to
be
and
probably
are
the
most
civilized
people
in
the
world
should
look
a
little
better
to
your
police
in
my
country
such
things
are
expected
torn
and
divided
as
it
has
been
by
factions
but
in
england
they
should
not
take
place
i
am
very
sorry
to
find
you
do
not
count
yourself
an
englishman
colonel
middleton
said
scriven
and
yet
you
speak
our
language
with
a
purity
both
in
accent
and
grammar
which
i
never
yet
heard
in
a
foreigner
henry
made
him
a
low
bow
as
if
he
supposed
that
a
compliment
was
intended
he
replied
however
at
the
same
time
my
father
language
was
the
first
i
learnt
and
i
have
always
taken
care
to
keep
it
up
by
seeking
the
society
and
conversation
of
englishmen
of
whom
plenty
are
to
be
found
both
in
spain
and
mexico
oh
you
have
been
in
mexico
said
scriven
pray
did
you
ever
meet
with
my
friend
odel
there
yes
replied
henry
he
was
a
great
friend
of
my
uncle
don
balthazar
xamorça
but
he
has
been
dead
for
many
years
now
odel
had
been
dead
so
long
that
scriven
had
great
difficulty
in
reconciling
his
suspicion
that
henry
hayley
and
colonel
middleton
were
the
same
person
with
the
knowledge
which
the
latter
seemed
to
have
had
of
him
he
resolved
to
inquire
further
poor
odel
had
a
very
beautiful
place
i
believe
in
the
city
of
mexico
he
said
quite
a
palace
i
have
been
told
not
exactly
in
the
city
replied
henry
he
had
only
a
in
the
town
but
about
three
miles
in
the
country
towards
the
foot
of
the
mountains
he
had
one
of
the
most
beautiful
villas
i
ever
saw
with
magnificent
gardens
quite
in
your
english
style
it
was
called
casilla
and
was
in
fact
a
palace
his
hospitality
was
unbounded
i
have
passed
many
a
pleasant
day
there
now
the
assertion
was
perfectly
true
for
the
casilla
had
for
some
years
belonged
to
odel
son
after
his
father
death
and
during
henry
stay
in
mexico
the
greater
part
of
the
young
gentleman
time
had
been
spent
there
scriven
was
becoming
more
and
more
puzzled
but
further
questions
were
prevented
by
the
entrance
of
the
conde
de
fraga
and
his
young
countess
his
compliments
were
first
of
course
paid
to
lady
fleetwood
who
proceeded
to
introduce
him
and
his
wife
who
could
speak
but
very
few
words
of
english
to
the
rest
of
her
guests
and
this
operation
was
proceeding
when
the
young
lady
eyes
lighted
upon
henry
and
her
whole
face
beamed
with
pleasure
at
seeing
one
whom
she
knew
well
and
who
could
converse
with
her
in
her
own
language
the
warm
and
friendly
recognition
which
then
took
place
between
the
young
spanish
nobleman
and
the
object
of
suspicion
did
not
escape
the
eyes
of
scriven
and
it
would
undoubtedly
have
removed
all
his
prepossessions
had
it
been
possible
ever
perfectly
to
eradicate
an
idea
which
had
once
taken
possession
of
his
mind
the
expected
guests
had
now
all
arrived
and
lady
fleetwood
had
ordered
dinner
to
be
served
but
before
it
was
announced
scriven
who
was
slightly
acquainted
with
the
conde
took
an
opportunity
of
drawing
him
aside
and
questioning
him
in
regard
to
colonel
middleton
henry
saw
the
man
oe
uvre
and
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
even
while
carrying
on
a
gay
conversation
with
the
young
countess
he
listened
to
what
was
passing
behind
him
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
he
could
not
exactly
catch
scriven
first
question
but
he
heard
the
young
count
reply
in
very
tolerable
english
oh
a
most
respectable
person
of
a
very
high
family
in
my
country
by
the
mother
side
related
to
all
the
xamorças
and
to
don
balthazar
who
left
him
a
very
handsome
fortune
have
you
known
him
long
asked
scriven
yes
answered
the
count
from
my
boyhood
we
were
at
school
together
and
in
the
same
regiment
afterwards
indeed
we
are
distantly
related
for
my
grandmother
niece
married
don
brother
son
who
likewise
inherited
a
part
of
his
large
fortune
scriven
seemed
satisfied
but
he
was
not
and
very
shortly
after
the
whole
party
went
down
to
the
now
in
her
arrangements
in
regard
to
that
very
difficult
but
yet
important
process
the
pairing
of
her
guests
lady
fleetwood
with
the
strongest
possible
desire
to
make
everybody
happy
usually
contrived
with
that
which
frequently
attended
her
best
efforts
to
part
all
those
who
would
have
liked
to
be
together
and
to
put
those
together
who
were
least
likely
to
suit
each
other
thus
on
the
present
occasion
there
was
only
one
person
well
satisfied
the
conde
of
course
as
highest
in
rank
took
her
down
to
dinner
but
maria
was
bestowed
upon
charles
marston
scriven
gave
his
arm
to
lady
anne
who
hated
him
mortally
and
henry
was
put
in
charge
of
the
young
spanish
lady
with
which
part
of
the
arrangement
she
was
better
contented
than
himself
the
dinner
would
nevertheless
have
passed
off
very
quietly
notwithstanding
the
inconvenient
manner
in
which
the
guests
were
planted
for
there
was
only
one
person
there
who
was
not
fully
aware
that
in
society
be
it
great
or
small
let
it
consist
of
two
or
of
thousands
at
a
or
in
the
great
scene
of
the
world
every
one
must
sacrifice
something
for
the
happiness
of
the
whole
and
that
to
make
the
best
of
our
own
position
is
the
condition
of
our
own
felicity
as
well
as
that
of
all
who
surround
us
the
dinner
would
have
passed
off
very
pleasantly
i
say
if
scriven
could
have
rested
satisfied
and
left
henry
at
peace
he
was
certainly
shaken
in
his
belief
that
colonel
middleton
and
henry
hayley
were
one
but
yet
he
was
displeased
with
his
great
resemblance
to
the
object
of
his
persevering
dislike
i
do
not
call
it
hate
for
hate
almost
implies
emotions
of
a
stronger
kind
than
scriven
usually
gave
way
to
he
would
have
taken
a
great
deal
of
trouble
he
would
have
spent
a
considerable
portion
of
time
he
would
even
have
devoted
no
inconsiderable
sum
of
money
to
prosecute
henry
hayley
and
to
hang
him
but
yet
he
would
have
done
it
all
coolly
deliberately
systematically
without
any
of
the
i
do
not
know
that
this
can
be
called
hate
but
perhaps
the
secret
of
the
passion
or
whatever
it
was
being
so
perdurable
was
the
absence
of
all
emotion
as
machines
which
are
much
shaken
in
their
operation
wear
out
soon
so
feelings
accompanied
by
much
agitation
are
generally
of
short
duration
on
the
present
occasion
however
scriven
could
not
be
content
to
let
the
young
officer
alone
he
was
not
what
can
be
called
uncivil
for
the
words
were
all
perfectly
polite
and
as
addressed
to
a
perfect
stranger
only
gave
the
idea
of
his
being
what
is
called
in
england
a
he
asked
him
a
multitude
of
questions
about
spain
about
his
own
private
history
about
things
which
had
happened
fourteen
fifteen
sixteen
years
before
he
cut
across
his
conversation
with
the
fair
spaniard
at
his
side
some
six
or
seven
times
and
though
as
i
have
said
perfectly
civil
there
was
a
sort
of
cool
superciliousness
in
his
tone
which
annoyed
henry
and
aroused
him
to
resist
on
the
young
officer
other
side
sat
lady
anne
mellent
and
just
at
the
period
when
the
fish
was
being
removed
she
took
advantage
of
the
butler
body
being
thrust
between
her
and
scriven
to
say
a
few
words
to
henry
in
a
low
tone
and
a
foreign
language
they
were
only
two
or
three
and
what
they
were
did
not
transpire
but
they
seemed
to
work
a
great
change
upon
her
companion
for
from
that
moment
his
demeanour
became
more
free
and
unconstrained
his
manner
especially
towards
scriven
not
exactly
supercilious
but
ironical
there
was
a
sort
of
playful
but
yet
rather
bitter
mockery
in
his
replies
which
grew
even
more
acerb
as
dinner
went
on
pray
colonel
middleton
were
you
at
the
taking
of
the
trocadero
demanded
scriven
after
a
very
brief
pause
if
i
had
been
there
at
all
replied
henry
i
should
have
been
at
its
defence
but
i
happened
then
to
be
at
school
boys
are
not
admitted
into
the
spanish
army
mr
scriven
i
should
suppose
not
replied
the
merchant
but
boys
do
strange
things
sometimes
very
true
and
men
too
answered
henry
otherwise
the
french
would
never
have
been
there
and
the
english
would
never
have
let
them
and
he
resumed
his
conversation
in
spanish
with
the
lady
by
his
side
i
am
afraid
from
what
i
have
heard
said
scriven
that
the
improvements
introduced
by
florida
blanca
into
the
commercial
and
financial
regulations
of
spain
have
not
had
any
permanent
effect
i
am
ashamed
to
say
replied
henry
that
i
know
as
little
of
the
subject
scriven
as
you
would
probably
know
of
a
regiment
of
dragoons
perhaps
i
may
know
more
of
military
matters
than
you
suppose
answered
scriven
of
the
city
replied
the
other
with
a
slight
smile
but
i
certainly
shall
not
catechise
you
on
the
subject
and
you
must
grant
me
the
same
indulgence
with
respect
to
commerce
i
know
nothing
about
it
though
i
have
a
very
great
respect
for
it
in
the
abstract
as
you
probably
have
for
the
army
oh
dear
no
replied
scriven
with
the
utmost
coolness
i
have
no
respect
at
all
for
the
army
i
can
assure
you
i
look
upon
it
as
a
necessary
evil
which
should
be
diminished
as
soon
as
possible
and
as
far
as
possible
and
the
navy
too
you
should
have
a
little
gratitude
for
the
navy
at
all
events
said
henry
laughing
as
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
navy
many
rich
ships
filled
with
english
merchandise
would
have
found
their
way
into
french
and
american
ports
during
the
late
wars
gratitude
is
altogether
out
of
the
question
answered
scriven
in
fact
it
is
a
mere
name
soldiers
fight
and
sailors
fight
because
they
are
paid
to
fight
why
should
i
be
grateful
to
them
for
doing
what
they
receive
my
money
to
do
if
they
do
do
their
duty
they
are
broke
or
shot
as
they
ought
to
be
and
if
they
do
they
are
paid
for
it
the
account
is
balanced
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
settled
on
either
part
a
very
commercial
view
of
the
subject
indeed
replied
henry
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
scriven
that
if
soldiers
and
sailors
fought
upon
such
principles
neither
merchants
nor
others
would
receive
much
effectual
protection
and
that
if
all
british
merchants
acted
upon
such
principles
they
would
find
very
few
soldiers
or
sailors
to
fight
for
them
silk
cotton
molasses
broadcloth
machinery
corn
wine
and
oil
are
not
the
only
things
to
be
considered
in
life
it
seems
to
me
neither
are
gold
and
silver
we
have
heard
of
such
things
as
honour
and
glory
which
can
only
be
worth
having
when
obtained
in
a
just
cause
and
generosity
and
benevolence
and
even
gratitude
and
if
these
things
are
all
to
be
swept
away
as
mere
names
i
see
not
why
honesty
and
integrity
should
not
go
too
there
are
moral
as
well
as
material
goods
and
high
principles
of
action
national
honour
and
national
glory
love
are
in
my
mind
not
only
compatible
with
but
inseparable
from
a
due
consideration
of
the
material
interests
of
a
country
oh
doubtless
answered
scriven
though
the
notions
that
we
attach
to
such
names
are
very
vague
and
fallacious
derived
from
the
rhodomontade
ages
of
chivalry
and
feudality
and
only
serving
to
mislead
imaginative
boys
you
are
in
no
fear
then
of
their
influence
replied
henry
lady
anne
may
i
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
wine
with
you
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
replied
lady
anne
for
the
conversation
has
been
so
heavy
that
i
certainly
do
want
something
to
enliven
me
and
in
pity
you
two
gentlemen
forbear
recollecting
that
i
neither
send
forth
ships
nor
command
armies
am
neither
a
merchant
nor
a
the
conversation
now
took
another
turn
lady
anne
spoke
in
french
to
the
fair
spaniard
lady
fleetwood
did
her
best
to
effect
the
same
charles
marston
talked
to
her
in
bad
spanish
and
good
italian
and
till
dinner
was
over
and
the
ladies
retired
all
went
on
gaily
and
cheerfully
the
sole
person
left
out
was
scriven
who
though
he
wrote
several
languages
with
sufficient
facility
was
but
little
accustomed
to
speak
any
tongue
but
his
own
he
was
not
well
pleased
indeed
not
so
much
because
he
was
excluded
a
good
deal
from
the
conversation
for
he
was
usually
as
economical
of
his
words
as
of
his
money
but
because
he
clearly
saw
that
those
around
him
had
recourse
to
another
tongue
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
discussions
which
were
pleasant
to
nobody
but
himself
his
first
attack
after
dinner
was
upon
his
nephew
to
whom
he
said
in
a
low
tone
why
charles
you
seem
peculiarly
lively
how
is
that
i
was
afraid
the
news
i
gave
you
yesterday
might
have
somewhat
depressed
your
spirits
not
at
all
dear
sir
thank
you
for
your
good
intentions
said
charles
marston
i
never
was
more
cheerful
in
my
life
and
as
to
the
is
that
i
have
many
reasons
for
being
cheerful
a
little
misfortune
sometimes
rightly
viewed
changes
to
a
benefit
in
the
first
place
i
have
an
opportunity
of
proving
to
my
dear
father
how
grateful
i
am
for
all
his
past
kindnesses
which
i
never
should
have
had
if
he
had
gone
on
in
perfect
prosperity
and
then
again
i
have
had
proofs
of
the
sincerity
and
disinterestedness
of
several
very
dear
friends
whose
generosity
i
might
never
have
known
to
its
full
extent
had
not
this
reverse
occurred
a
very
philosophical
view
said
scriven
between
his
teeth
but
as
i
suppose
you
do
not
intend
to
live
dependent
upon
these
friends
let
me
ask
if
you
have
considered
the
hints
i
threw
out
with
regard
to
your
future
course
i
have
not
given
them
a
thought
replied
charles
i
saw
at
once
that
they
could
be
of
no
service
to
me
and
therefore
judged
my
dear
uncle
that
it
might
be
bad
economy
to
waste
much
reflection
upon
them
you
are
as
polite
as
wise
my
good
nephew
rejoined
his
uncle
drily
oh
it
is
what
you
call
due
course
of
exchange
answered
charles
you
have
told
me
a
thousand
times
that
you
are
fond
of
plain
speaking
and
have
proved
the
fact
to
me
in
many
instances
middleton
you
have
not
yet
been
to
see
our
excellent
friend
winkworth
and
he
is
half
angry
with
you
i
was
out
of
town
all
yesterday
replied
henry
and
did
not
arrive
till
it
was
just
time
to
dress
i
was
very
sorry
indeed
to
find
from
your
note
that
he
had
met
with
such
an
unpleasant
adventure
i
hope
he
is
better
oh
going
on
quite
well
said
charles
and
though
still
obliged
to
keep
his
bed
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
i
will
call
early
replied
henry
and
now
shall
we
not
join
the
ladies
this
sitting
after
dinner
seems
a
very
strange
custom
to
our
foreign
eyes
as
he
spoke
he
rose
and
the
rest
followed
his
example
in
the
the
whole
party
were
more
at
ease
for
they
divided
themselves
according
to
their
several
tastes
and
henry
was
by
maria
side
during
a
great
part
of
the
evening
the
moments
flew
happily
with
them
for
though
she
was
a
little
anxious
in
regard
to
the
keen
and
searching
look
with
which
her
uncle
observed
the
open
attentions
of
her
lover
yet
there
was
a
counterbalancing
pleasure
in
his
society
and
his
conversation
which
fully
made
up
for
the
slight
uneasiness
she
experienced
she
was
too
frank
and
straightforward
in
her
nature
to
conceal
altogether
the
happiness
she
felt
although
she
strove
to
do
so
as
far
as
possible
and
endeavoured
to
show
every
attention
to
her
guests
who
were
soon
increased
by
two
or
three
visiters
from
the
neighbourhood
she
even
fancied
that
she
succeeded
very
well
but
nevertheless
there
was
hardly
an
eye
in
the
room
which
did
not
remark
certain
small
differences
of
manner
when
speaking
with
colonel
middleton
a
look
of
bright
intelligence
a
smile
which
betrayed
the
secret
to
more
than
one
talkative
person
who
was
quite
ready
to
carry
the
news
over
the
whole
town
henry
too
seemed
either
carried
away
by
passion
or
perversely
determined
to
display
his
love
when
obliged
to
converse
with
others
although
his
conversation
was
very
different
from
that
of
most
men
of
the
world
in
the
great
capital
deep
powerful
going
to
the
very
heart
of
the
matter
in
question
yet
withal
there
was
a
sparkling
gaiety
of
manner
a
laughing
and
almost
ironical
spirit
veiling
the
depths
of
the
ideas
it
was
like
one
of
those
and
plaintive
airs
in
the
works
of
the
italian
composers
to
which
is
attached
a
gay
and
fluttering
accompaniment
as
if
to
bide
under
an
airy
mockery
the
strength
of
the
feelings
expressed
but
when
he
conversed
with
her
it
was
all
very
different
the
language
though
not
the
language
of
love
was
all
warm
and
impassioned
and
the
manner
though
it
might
not
be
sad
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
words
scriven
marked
the
whole
very
much
displeased
and
determined
promptly
to
interfere
though
he
somewhat
miscalculated
the
extent
of
his
power
excellent
lady
fleetwood
too
was
very
uneasy
having
made
up
her
mind
that
charles
marston
ought
somehow
or
other
to
marry
his
cousin
she
saw
all
sorts
of
dangers
and
perplexities
in
the
very
marked
attentions
of
colonel
middleton
and
the
favourable
manner
in
which
maria
received
them
she
looked
at
charles
several
times
to
see
how
he
bore
it
and
was
very
willing
had
it
been
possible
to
have
bestowed
a
good
deal
of
unnecessary
compassion
upon
her
nephew
but
charles
seemed
obstinately
resolved
to
show
that
he
wanted
no
compassion
at
all
he
talked
a
great
deal
to
lady
anne
mellent
and
lady
anne
to
him
and
every
now
and
then
a
quiet
little
ray
of
loving
light
stole
out
of
her
eyes
as
she
lifted
them
to
charles
marston
which
might
have
undeceived
any
one
but
an
aunt
or
a
parent
in
the
end
however
lady
anne
sent
him
away
from
her
saying
in
a
low
voice
there
go
and
talk
to
somebody
else
we
have
flirted
together
enough
perhaps
too
much
charles
and
now
i
am
going
to
flirt
with
colonel
middleton
to
make
up
for
it
and
her
ladyship
kept
her
word
for
she
took
an
opportunity
very
soon
after
of
calling
henry
to
her
side
and
to
the
eyes
of
most
people
in
the
room
seemed
to
be
coquetting
with
him
in
a
very
determined
manner
it
were
vain
to
deny
that
charles
marston
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
i
will
not
say
exactly
jealous
for
that
would
imply
more
than
he
felt
but
he
wished
that
lady
anne
would
be
a
little
more
cautious
and
thought
that
she
and
frank
middleton
need
not
exactly
talk
in
so
low
a
tone
or
with
their
heads
quite
so
close
together
he
spoke
worse
spanish
than
ever
to
the
fair
young
countess
beside
whom
he
had
sat
down
and
he
was
going
on
step
by
step
to
make
himself
seriously
uneasy
when
lady
anne
eyes
were
suddenly
turned
towards
him
and
found
his
fixed
upon
her
face
a
very
grave
look
instantly
came
over
it
it
seemed
to
him
like
a
look
of
reproach
and
the
words
of
warning
which
she
had
spoken
to
him
the
moment
before
instantly
recurred
to
his
mind
there
is
some
secret
here
he
said
to
himself
she
warned
me
of
the
very
course
she
is
now
pursuing
and
told
me
she
had
a
motive
for
it
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
what
it
can
be
and
yet
it
is
strange
how
i
myself
have
always
felt
towards
middleton
ever
since
i
knew
him
from
the
first
moment
he
seemed
like
an
old
friend
and
his
face
too
was
familiar
to
me
if
i
had
not
known
that
he
had
been
brought
up
all
his
life
in
spain
i
should
have
fancied
we
had
been
at
eton
together
at
that
moment
his
uncle
approached
and
bending
down
his
head
he
said
i
must
have
some
conversation
with
you
charles
about
this
friend
of
yours
do
you
know
much
of
his
history
oh
dear
yes
replied
his
nephew
i
heard
the
whole
of
it
from
the
spanish
ambassador
at
rome
who
is
a
relation
of
his
he
is
the
son
of
dona
eleanora
xamorça
the
niece
of
don
balthazar
a
rich
old
grandee
who
died
some
time
ago
during
some
of
the
troubles
in
spain
she
was
sent
into
a
convent
for
protection
and
thence
ran
away
with
and
married
an
english
gentleman
of
the
name
of
middleton
they
soon
quarrelled
however
and
separated
and
the
old
gentleman
took
her
boy
and
brought
him
up
as
his
own
son
do
you
happen
to
recollect
the
face
of
your
old
schoolfellow
henry
hayley
asked
scriven
good
heaven
so
he
is
very
like
indeed
said
charles
i
have
often
been
puzzling
myself
to
think
who
it
is
to
whom
he
bears
so
great
a
resemblance
great
indeed
said
scriven
drily
so
great
that
i
do
not
understand
it
it
is
impossible
i
suppose
that
they
can
be
the
same
person
charles
marston
laughed
utterly
my
dear
uncle
he
said
here
is
fraga
who
has
known
him
from
his
boyhood
and
depend
upon
it
spaniards
are
not
such
disinterested
people
as
to
suffer
a
stranger
to
deprive
them
of
a
large
fortune
without
being
very
sure
that
he
had
a
right
to
it
now
i
know
that
middleton
came
in
for
of
old
balthazar
riches
you
may
ask
any
one
in
spanish
society
the
thing
is
perfectly
well
known
humph
said
scriven
and
walked
away
he
had
suggested
thoughts
to
his
nephew
mind
however
which
did
not
so
speedily
retire
the
likeness
when
it
had
been
once
pointed
out
struck
him
more
and
more
every
moment
the
strange
intimacy
which
had
arisen
between
the
young
officer
and
lady
anne
to
whom
he
was
almost
a
stranger
and
the
evident
regard
which
existed
between
him
and
maria
whose
heart
was
little
likely
to
be
captivated
at
first
sight
were
all
extraordinary
circumstances
which
seemed
to
favour
the
suspicions
that
his
uncle
entertained
and
were
with
difficulty
accounted
for
on
any
other
ground
but
then
on
the
other
hand
the
information
he
had
received
in
regard
to
his
friend
birth
and
history
was
so
precise
and
had
been
given
by
persons
necessarily
so
well
informed
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
doubt
that
the
young
officer
was
exactly
what
he
represented
himself
to
be
charles
was
in
a
maze
of
perplexity
and
remained
so
all
the
evening
till
at
length
lady
anne
beckoned
him
to
her
side
again
and
playfully
scolded
him
for
his
thoughts
charles
laughingly
evaded
the
attack
but
she
asked
do
you
think
i
can
not
read
your
looks
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
charles
if
you
could
see
what
is
going
on
in
my
heart
as
well
as
i
can
see
what
is
going
on
in
yours
i
should
have
no
such
looks
to
complain
of
and
now
for
your
pains
i
will
torment
you
for
a
week
longer
the
latter
part
of
which
you
shall
come
and
spend
with
me
in
there
do
not
suppose
i
am
going
to
insist
upon
your
marrying
me
directly
for
i
do
not
intend
any
such
thing
but
i
have
engaged
dear
aunt
fleetwood
and
maria
while
you
four
gentlemen
were
drinking
too
much
wine
after
the
sottish
custom
of
the
land
and
i
asked
colonel
middleton
just
now
so
you
must
come
and
be
jealous
but
winkworth
said
charles
i
do
not
like
to
leave
him
in
his
present
state
he
must
come
too
said
the
fair
lady
i
will
call
and
ask
him
so
pray
tell
him
that
i
never
suffer
myself
to
be
contradicted
by
anybody
can
you
not
put
it
off
for
a
week
asked
charles
i
do
not
think
winkworth
will
be
well
enough
to
travel
lady
anne
mused
no
she
said
i
can
not
for
i
have
determined
to
take
frank
middleton
down
there
on
thursday
next
and
you
know
charles
it
would
do
for
him
and
me
to
go
down
and
live
together
by
ourselves
till
you
and
your
friend
were
ready
to
come
propriety
think
of
propriety
and
she
looked
up
in
his
face
with
a
gay
and
meaning
laugh
no
no
get
your
friend
well
as
soon
as
you
can
maria
and
i
and
lady
fleetwood
will
go
down
on
wednesday
colonel
middleton
will
come
down
on
thursday
and
you
and
winkworth
must
join
us
afterwards
so
now
for
i
am
going
home
charles
saw
her
to
her
carriage
and
then
without
returning
to
his
aunt
walked
across
to
his
own
hotel
but
during
a
great
part
of
the
night
his
thoughts
were
occupied
with
henry
hayley
and
colonel
middleton
and
the
same
objects
formed
the
subject
of
his
dreams
chapter
xx
to
retrace
one
steps
is
always
a
difficult
and
very
often
a
most
unpleasant
task
as
every
one
must
have
felt
who
has
left
his
at
home
and
had
to
go
back
for
it
imagination
however
kind
quick
ready
imagination
with
one
bound
skips
over
the
intervening
space
and
plants
us
on
the
spot
without
tracking
back
the
weary
footprints
of
our
advance
she
shall
lend
us
her
wings
for
a
moment
to
take
us
back
to
the
spot
where
we
left
our
worthy
friend
joshua
brown
the
pedlar
from
the
door
of
henry
hayley
room
he
walked
spoke
for
a
moment
with
farmer
graves
took
what
little
breakfast
he
would
accept
and
then
departed
bending
his
steps
towards
the
same
common
which
he
had
passed
during
the
preceding
evening
he
followed
the
same
track
exactly
and
he
had
his
reasons
for
so
doing
for
he
very
much
desired
to
obtain
some
little
information
in
regard
to
those
rough
friends
who
had
become
too
familiar
with
his
pack
and
his
companion
his
first
was
at
the
sandpit
where
the
tinker
family
had
taken
up
their
abode
but
there
he
only
found
the
old
man
and
his
daughter
and
sitting
down
with
them
he
chatted
over
the
adventures
of
the
preceding
night
expressing
his
determination
to
try
if
he
could
not
find
out
the
men
who
had
plundered
him
and
punish
them
as
they
deserved
you
wo
find
them
at
the
hovel
under
said
the
old
tinker
for
james
has
been
upon
the
lookout
this
morning
with
some
of
payne
men
and
the
place
is
empty
they
have
gone
farther
off
because
they
know
one
trick
of
this
kind
is
enough
for
the
neighbourhood
they
have
left
your
box
there
however
joshua
and
james
would
not
bring
it
away
because
he
did
not
know
you
might
come
here
and
thought
it
very
likely
you
might
get
the
people
from
the
farm
and
go
down
to
the
hut
yourself
i
will
go
down
alone
if
you
are
sure
there
is
nobody
there
though
i
rather
fancy
the
box
is
empty
enough
by
this
time
and
it
is
not
of
much
use
when
there
is
nothing
in
it
it
always
worth
something
though
answered
the
tinker
i
never
saw
anything
that
man
made
which
might
not
be
turned
into
something
for
a
second
turn
after
it
had
served
a
first
however
the
empty
enough
and
they
not
come
back
in
a
hurry
you
may
be
sure
of
that
after
some
further
conversation
of
the
same
kind
the
pedlar
plodded
on
upon
his
way
he
did
not
approach
the
hut
without
precaution
for
the
impression
of
the
man
knee
upon
his
chest
was
not
as
yet
effaced
from
his
memory
and
being
a
peaceful
personage
he
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
encounter
rough
treatment
himself
or
bestow
it
upon
others
he
paused
then
upon
the
hill
from
which
a
sight
was
obtained
of
the
hovel
and
watched
with
a
keen
eye
for
any
indication
of
the
place
being
inhabited
having
satisfied
himself
so
far
he
descended
the
hill
still
farther
looking
into
every
dell
and
hollow
of
the
moor
nothing
was
seen
however
that
moved
or
had
the
breath
of
life
except
a
few
lapwings
hovering
about
and
every
now
and
then
resting
upon
the
little
knolls
and
cautiously
approaching
the
wretched
hut
the
pedlar
looked
through
what
had
once
been
a
glazed
window
and
then
pushed
open
the
crazy
door
and
went
in
on
the
floor
lay
his
mahogany
box
wide
open
with
all
the
contents
taken
out
while
a
little
tray
which
it
had
contained
had
been
thrown
to
some
distance
scattered
round
the
hovel
in
every
direction
were
small
pieces
of
bright
yellow
carded
cotton
on
which
his
small
articles
of
jewellery
were
usually
displayed
to
attract
the
attention
of
admiring
damsels
and
numerous
were
the
scraps
of
paper
which
had
likewise
been
cast
down
the
worthy
pedlar
perhaps
felt
more
vexed
at
the
sight
of
the
small
reverence
which
had
been
shown
to
his
cherished
wares
than
he
had
even
been
to
their
loss
at
first
the
rascals
have
taken
them
all
out
to
carry
them
easily
he
said
and
now
they
go
and
sell
them
all
for
ten
shillings
or
a
pound
i
warrant
with
habitual
care
however
he
set
to
work
gathering
up
all
the
pieces
of
cotton
and
scraps
of
paper
and
placed
them
hurriedly
in
the
box
the
lock
had
been
dexterously
picked
with
some
instrument
showing
that
the
gentry
into
whose
hands
it
had
fallen
had
come
armed
and
well
prepared
for
the
various
contingencies
of
their
profession
the
pedlar
own
key
easily
locked
it
again
but
the
strap
was
gone
and
he
was
obliged
to
take
it
under
his
arm
comforting
himself
by
saying
it
is
light
enough
now
so
it
wo
be
heavy
to
carry
this
done
he
trudged
away
walking
stoutly
on
over
the
three
or
four
miles
of
common
ground
which
lay
between
that
hovel
and
the
hut
which
had
been
lately
inhabited
by
poor
rebecca
hayley
as
he
approached
it
he
was
surprised
to
see
the
door
and
windows
once
more
open
and
he
asked
himself
not
without
some
sort
of
apprehension
whether
his
assailants
of
the
preceding
night
might
not
have
migrated
thither
he
was
relieved
the
moment
after
by
seeing
the
apparition
of
the
boy
jim
at
the
door
of
the
hut
and
walking
on
confidently
he
said
why
jim
my
man
i
thought
you
were
gone
i
was
here
last
night
and
found
a
gentleman
looking
for
you
ay
i
ought
to
have
been
in
london
said
the
boy
but
i
found
a
whole
heap
of
things
belonging
to
poor
bessy
whom
they
took
away
from
me
and
i
did
know
what
to
do
with
them
so
i
packed
them
all
up
and
took
them
over
to
white
the
parson
who
was
always
so
kind
to
us
both
but
he
was
away
so
i
was
obliged
to
bring
them
back
again
i
am
sure
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
them
in
london
exclaimed
the
pedlar
seizing
upon
the
only
part
of
the
boy
speech
which
surprised
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
london
my
lad
you
never
get
on
there
oh
yes
i
shall
replied
the
boy
i
got
a
place
there
and
am
going
to
be
made
a
footman
of
what
with
the
young
gentleman
i
saw
here
last
night
i
suppose
said
the
pedlar
no
not
with
the
young
one
with
the
old
one
replied
jim
and
then
following
the
train
of
his
own
ideas
he
went
on
she
had
hid
them
away
so
cunningly
under
her
bed
that
nobody
saw
them
when
they
were
taking
her
away
saw
what
demanded
the
pedlar
why
all
manner
of
things
answered
the
boy
bits
of
silk
and
shawls
and
old
gloves
and
a
quantity
of
paper
and
music
and
a
brass
let
me
look
at
the
said
the
pedlar
if
you
got
it
here
oh
yes
i
got
it
replied
jim
for
i
did
not
like
to
leave
them
with
white
housekeeper
i
put
that
in
my
pocket
too
for
fear
it
should
fall
out
of
the
bundle
here
it
is
brass
you
fool
exclaimed
the
pedlar
examining
a
very
large
and
vinaigrette
why
that
is
gold
and
these
are
real
stones
too
i
do
believe
yes
they
are
indeed
he
continued
carrying
the
trinket
to
the
door
for
better
light
that
worth
more
than
a
hundred
guineas
or
i
no
judge
all
the
worse
for
me
answered
jim
in
a
desponding
tone
for
what
i
am
to
do
with
these
things
i
do
not
know
why
the
best
thing
you
can
do
with
them
is
to
take
them
to
the
poor
old
woman
herself
said
the
pedlar
but
i
do
know
where
she
is
rejoined
the
boy
i
think
i
take
them
up
with
me
to
london
and
give
them
into
the
charge
of
my
master
for
he
a
very
kind
gentleman
and
perhaps
may
find
out
where
poor
bessy
is
that
the
best
thing
you
can
do
replied
the
pedlar
but
how
are
you
to
get
them
up
i
to
go
by
the
coach
which
passes
every
day
at
three
was
the
boy
reply
he
gave
me
money
and
told
me
how
to
come
then
i
think
i
go
by
it
too
observed
the
pedlar
thoughtfully
if
before
it
comes
i
can
get
to
g
and
back
and
he
named
a
town
which
i
shall
leave
nameless
for
fear
any
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
place
should
judge
what
is
to
follow
too
personal
why
it
only
five
miles
there
answered
the
boy
and
the
coach
stops
at
the
bear
it
can
take
you
up
there
if
you
like
to
go
joshua
do
you
show
that
gold
box
to
any
one
then
said
the
pedlar
for
there
are
a
good
many
rascals
about
as
i
know
to
my
cost
and
many
a
man
would
think
it
worth
his
while
to
give
you
a
knock
on
the
head
just
to
get
that
box
but
i
tell
you
what
will
be
better
still
my
lad
he
added
after
a
moment
thought
if
you
can
get
ready
quick
you
had
better
come
along
with
me
i
can
carry
something
for
you
for
my
pack
light
enough
now
and
we
shall
be
a
sort
of
protection
to
each
other
by
the
way
ay
there
been
a
sad
heap
of
rascals
down
here
lately
replied
jim
but
i
quite
ready
this
minute
joshua
there
all
i
going
to
take
galland
at
the
inn
has
promised
to
send
up
some
one
to
carry
away
the
other
things
not
much
to
take
care
of
answered
the
pedlar
but
come
along
shut
the
door
and
windows
close
and
then
give
the
key
to
galland
as
we
go
the
poor
boy
arrangements
were
soon
made
for
whether
when
justly
weighed
the
gifts
of
fortune
be
or
be
not
more
cumbersome
than
the
cares
of
poverty
certain
it
is
that
little
is
more
lightly
looked
after
than
much
man
is
the
most
creature
upon
earth
and
he
takes
not
into
consideration
whether
in
increasing
his
conveniences
he
does
not
increase
his
wants
whether
in
increasing
his
wants
he
does
not
increase
his
cares
he
seeks
that
which
is
comfortable
to
him
at
the
moment
without
asking
if
it
do
not
imply
that
he
must
seek
for
more
which
may
be
more
difficult
to
obtain
and
the
instinct
of
progress
still
carries
him
on
at
once
an
evidence
of
his
imperfection
and
his
immortality
the
instinct
of
beasts
is
wiser
for
this
world
offer
a
sheep
which
stands
half
sheltered
from
the
wind
under
a
leafless
hedge
a
coat
waistcoat
and
breeches
and
the
beast
will
run
away
or
butt
you
in
disdain
content
with
what
he
has
he
looks
not
beyond
the
present
hour
and
shrinks
from
the
luxury
that
may
become
a
trammel
the
comfort
that
must
become
a
care
his
life
his
thought
his
desire
is
for
the
present
but
how
different
is
man
his
life
is
in
the
future
and
every
act
and
thought
and
aspiration
and
custom
the
history
of
the
individual
the
history
of
the
species
the
traditions
of
other
years
the
prophecies
of
time
to
come
the
feelings
of
each
moment
the
deeds
known
or
unchronicled
all
show
that
there
is
a
voice
in
the
human
heart
crying
ever
on
on
on
to
eternity
on
to
progress
to
improvement
to
perfection
on
towards
immortality
and
god
happy
however
are
those
who
have
few
cares
upon
whose
early
years
fortune
often
called
hard
has
not
showered
desires
and
tasks
and
responsibilities
it
can
not
indeed
be
said
of
them
as
it
was
sublimely
said
of
the
lily
of
the
field
that
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
yet
the
labour
is
light
and
has
its
reward
the
privations
are
comparatively
little
felt
and
the
cares
are
few
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
contains
in
itself
the
seed
of
all
desire
and
all
regret
and
those
who
eat
the
least
of
it
retain
i
do
believe
the
most
of
paradise
in
paradise
best
blessing
content
the
boy
had
little
to
care
for
and
his
preparations
were
soon
made
the
barren
spot
on
which
his
youth
had
passed
was
left
with
little
regret
though
perhaps
regret
might
come
afterwards
there
was
nothing
to
attach
him
to
it
firmly
for
the
only
things
which
had
given
it
sunshine
had
been
taken
away
and
on
he
went
walking
beside
the
pedlar
thinking
and
talking
of
what
he
was
to
do
next
his
heart
was
a
very
open
one
he
had
nothing
to
conceal
he
had
no
motive
whatsoever
for
keeping
back
disguising
or
adulterating
one
idea
that
rose
in
his
mind
one
fact
that
had
occurred
one
purpose
for
the
future
and
he
naturally
told
the
pedlar
all
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
and
his
great
and
strong
anxiety
again
to
see
her
whom
he
called
bessy
he
could
have
opened
his
mind
to
no
one
better
fitted
to
advise
him
than
his
accidental
companion
and
to
say
truth
few
were
better
fitted
to
understand
his
feelings
and
to
take
an
interest
in
them
if
you
want
to
find
out
where
she
is
jim
said
joshua
brown
nothing
can
be
easier
you
say
the
driver
was
one
of
postboys
well
they
each
a
line
and
go
to
the
same
inns
we
can
easily
get
a
and
trace
them
from
one
inn
to
another
till
we
come
to
the
last
and
then
a
pot
of
beer
to
the
boy
who
drove
them
on
will
make
him
tell
you
where
he
took
the
poor
thing
this
hint
of
so
simple
a
proceeding
which
he
had
never
thought
of
was
a
ray
of
light
to
the
poor
lad
and
he
determined
to
act
upon
it
without
delay
at
galland
he
begged
a
card
of
the
house
which
as
was
customary
at
those
times
of
posting
had
a
list
of
the
stages
and
inns
on
the
road
to
london
and
satisfied
thus
far
he
walked
on
more
cheerfully
with
his
companion
till
they
came
to
the
town
lying
a
little
out
of
the
direct
road
at
which
joshua
brown
had
some
business
to
transact
it
was
a
large
and
populous
place
with
one
broad
street
running
up
a
hill
and
several
smaller
ones
deviating
from
the
main
road
at
right
angles
with
numerous
lanes
and
alleys
meandering
at
the
back
here
joshua
brown
paused
at
the
inn
where
the
coach
stopped
and
at
which
he
was
well
known
and
respected
and
leaving
the
boy
there
with
a
strong
recommendation
he
himself
walked
up
the
hill
stopping
for
a
moment
or
two
at
one
of
those
shops
which
as
is
common
in
country
towns
combined
the
sale
of
jewellery
with
that
of
pasteboard
stamps
and
books
soap
toys
and
a
few
very
significant
words
passed
between
him
and
the
master
of
the
shop
and
then
joshua
brown
sallied
forth
again
turned
into
one
of
the
side
streets
then
down
a
narrow
sort
of
lane
with
small
houses
on
either
hand
and
stopped
opposite
a
black
baby
in
a
white
cap
and
which
hung
suspended
from
an
iron
stanchion
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
door
on
the
other
side
was
a
shop
with
very
small
panes
of
glass
in
the
window
over
which
was
an
inscription
purporting
that
mingleton
bowes
was
a
dealer
in
marine
stores
now
what
anybody
could
want
with
marine
stores
in
one
of
the
most
inland
towns
of
all
england
from
which
there
was
no
communication
whatever
with
the
sea
except
by
wagon
or
the
inscription
did
not
set
forth
however
joshua
brown
entered
the
shop
and
found
it
vacant
of
everything
but
rusty
pieces
of
iron
coils
of
rope
rolls
of
lead
copper
and
iron
weights
an
immense
variety
of
scales
and
balances
a
great
quantity
of
links
and
torches
the
most
complete
assortment
of
in
europe
large
stone
jars
filled
with
dripping
two
or
three
piles
of
rags
bundles
of
quills
packets
of
cocoa
numerous
and
kippered
salmon
a
jar
of
russian
cranberries
and
an
infinite
variety
of
odoriferous
articles
squalid
to
look
upon
and
not
much
more
agreeable
to
the
nose
than
to
the
eye
in
short
it
would
seem
the
title
of
dealer
in
marine
stores
implies
that
a
man
buys
and
sells
everything
under
the
sun
as
there
was
no
human
being
in
the
shop
nor
any
other
animate
creature
whatever
except
an
enormous
white
cat
sitting
upon
the
counter
her
hairy
back
resting
upon
the
cut
side
of
a
single
gloucester
cheese
joshua
first
rubbed
his
feet
upon
the
floor
to
call
attention
to
his
presence
and
not
finding
that
to
succeed
he
stamped
once
or
twice
it
is
wonderful
how
indifferent
the
people
of
the
house
were
to
the
chances
of
robbery
for
though
he
stamped
nobody
came
and
he
might
have
carried
off
the
large
jar
of
cranberries
itself
without
attracting
any
attention
now
whether
it
was
that
joshua
brown
thought
it
might
be
rude
or
dangerous
to
intrude
upon
the
privacy
of
some
persons
who
were
talking
together
in
the
back
shop
with
the
door
shut
or
whether
there
was
a
touch
of
the
fantastic
in
his
disposition
i
will
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
but
certain
it
is
that
the
method
he
took
to
bring
the
master
of
the
house
from
his
fit
of
absence
was
somewhat
eccentric
having
a
good
thick
glove
on
his
right
hand
he
approached
it
quietly
to
the
tail
of
the
large
and
getting
the
last
joint
between
his
finger
and
thumb
he
said
in
an
authoritative
tone
call
your
master
adding
at
the
same
time
an
awful
twisting
pinch
which
nearly
wrenched
the
bone
from
its
next
neighbour
a
frightful
squall
was
the
first
result
and
then
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
tom
claws
were
applied
to
his
assailant
hand
and
arm
the
teeth
would
have
followed
but
at
the
same
moment
joshua
brown
shook
the
beast
off
and
a
little
man
with
red
eyelids
and
a
rugged
countenance
rushed
in
from
the
back
shop
closing
the
door
sharply
behind
him
he
stared
at
the
pedlar
with
his
bleared
eyes
for
an
instant
and
then
walking
round
behind
the
counter
asked
in
a
very
obsequious
tone
what
he
wanted
joshua
put
his
head
across
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
the
ear
the
dealer
in
marine
stores
looked
somewhat
suspiciously
at
the
stranger
and
then
shook
his
head
replying
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
sir
the
tone
was
the
most
innocent
in
the
world
and
the
countenance
expressed
a
dull
surprise
but
joshua
again
advanced
his
head
and
addressed
a
few
more
words
in
a
whisper
to
the
worthy
shopkeeper
producing
a
slight
smile
upon
the
lips
which
were
very
much
like
those
of
a
toad
while
a
ray
of
intelligence
shot
from
the
dull
eyes
all
safe
he
said
safe
as
a
nut
replied
the
pedlar
otherwise
i
should
have
pinched
the
cat
tail
i
do
know
anything
about
it
at
present
replied
the
man
of
marine
stores
but
i
dare
say
i
can
find
out
is
it
the
box
you
want
no
no
answered
joshua
impatiently
i
been
paid
the
full
worth
of
the
box
already
i
told
you
it
is
the
and
all
that
is
in
it
where
are
you
lodging
said
the
shopkeeper
i
dare
say
i
can
find
out
something
about
it
in
a
day
or
two
i
am
lodging
nowhere
answered
the
pedlar
for
i
only
waiting
for
the
coach
to
go
to
town
and
as
to
staying
a
day
or
two
that
no
go
at
all
master
mingy
bowes
for
if
i
do
take
the
book
up
with
me
the
whole
business
will
be
put
in
the
hands
of
the
peelers
and
then
you
know
quite
well
i
shall
lose
my
share
you
lose
yours
and
the
gentlemen
will
lose
theirs
stay
a
minute
said
the
man
i
will
just
go
and
look
in
my
books
i
may
have
got
it
down
for
aught
i
know
two
or
three
little
matters
have
come
in
since
the
morning
ay
do
said
the
pedlar
and
remember
we
all
upon
honour
and
share
according
to
rule
the
man
retired
into
the
back
shop
and
his
books
must
have
been
somewhat
difficult
to
read
though
rather
loquacious
for
he
remained
a
considerable
time
during
which
there
was
a
sort
of
buzz
heard
through
the
door
apparently
proceeding
from
more
tongues
than
one
at
length
the
shopkeeper
put
his
head
out
and
beckoned
to
the
pedlar
saying
just
step
in
here
for
a
minute
joshua
brown
accepted
the
invitation
and
walking
round
the
end
of
the
counter
entered
the
back
shop
there
as
he
had
expected
he
found
that
the
marine
store
dealer
was
not
alone
for
on
one
of
the
two
chairs
which
were
unencumbered
by
inanimate
lumber
sat
a
tall
powerful
fellow
of
no
very
prepossessing
appearance
with
a
red
and
white
handkerchief
bound
round
his
head
and
a
large
rough
on
his
chair
was
near
the
fire
his
feet
were
upon
the
fender
and
his
back
was
towards
the
door
but
he
turned
half
round
as
he
sat
when
the
pedlar
entered
and
scowled
at
him
with
one
eye
for
the
other
was
nearly
closed
evidently
from
the
effects
of
a
blow
with
a
quiet
deliberate
step
joshua
brown
walked
straight
to
the
other
chair
and
seated
himself
in
silence
so
that
he
had
his
face
turned
partly
towards
the
grate
on
his
right
hand
partly
towards
the
door
of
the
shop
and
the
preceding
tenant
of
the
room
while
his
back
was
exactly
opposite
to
a
window
in
a
small
paved
court
which
ran
at
the
rear
of
the
house
the
position
is
in
some
degree
important
and
it
may
also
be
necessary
to
remark
that
the
window
was
shaded
by
a
wire
blind
which
prevented
any
one
seeing
distinctly
into
the
room
from
without
while
those
who
were
inside
could
clearly
perceive
all
that
passed
within
certain
limits
in
the
lane
some
men
are
born
diplomatists
and
although
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
this
was
the
case
with
the
pedlar
yet
upon
the
present
occasion
he
showed
that
he
possessed
one
very
important
quality
for
skilful
negociation
namely
that
of
holding
his
tongue
he
had
already
taken
the
initiative
in
his
communication
with
the
master
of
the
house
and
that
he
thought
was
quite
sufficient
for
the
time
this
silence
on
his
part
seemed
not
at
all
satisfactory
to
the
other
parties
present
the
man
by
the
fire
glared
at
him
with
his
one
undimmed
orb
but
said
nothing
and
the
first
effort
of
the
dealer
in
marine
stores
who
observed
as
a
sort
of
introduction
to
the
conference
this
here
is
the
gentleman
sam
produced
no
result
for
both
still
sat
perfectly
silent
he
tried
again
however
addressing
himself
now
to
the
pedlar
saying
this
here
is
the
gentleman
sir
you
must
speak
to
him
about
what
you
were
mentioning
to
me
what
am
i
to
say
to
him
asked
joshua
brown
i
do
know
who
he
is
why
what
the
devil
has
that
to
do
with
it
asked
the
man
who
had
been
denominated
sam
you
come
here
for
something
do
you
why
do
you
say
what
it
is
because
i
do
like
to
talk
of
things
to
people
who
may
have
no
concern
with
them
answered
the
pedlar
however
as
i
suppose
master
mingy
bowes
has
told
ye
something
of
the
business
all
i
mean
to
say
is
that
i
know
where
a
hundred
pound
is
to
be
got
for
a
certain
that
was
boned
last
night
about
a
mile
and
a
half
on
side
of
that
wo
do
muttered
the
other
man
to
himself
in
a
tone
which
was
perhaps
not
exactly
intended
to
conceal
the
observation
from
the
pedlar
those
who
have
got
it
know
well
enough
what
it
is
worth
and
it
worth
more
than
that
i
do
know
answered
the
pedlar
aloud
all
i
know
is
what
will
be
given
and
i
think
out
of
the
hundred
i
ought
to
have
ten
pounds
for
my
share
the
man
raised
his
eye
to
the
pedlar
face
without
however
lifting
his
head
and
muttered
a
low
and
very
ferocious
curse
condemning
very
grievously
his
own
blood
and
eyes
though
one
of
the
latter
seemed
mortgaged
to
its
full
value
if
any
one
got
the
for
that
money
well
i
very
sorry
we
ca
make
a
deal
then
said
the
pedlar
i
always
like
to
turn
an
honest
penny
when
i
can
and
i
thought
this
was
a
good
chance
but
if
people
wo
be
reasonable
i
ca
help
it
i
a
notion
they
wo
get
more
however
do
what
they
may
and
think
what
they
like
i
know
better
said
the
ruffian
lifting
up
his
head
and
i
tell
you
what
master
it
shall
cost
him
a
cool
two
hundred
or
he
have
it
i
do
care
about
any
nonsense
there
that
in
this
here
and
he
took
the
out
of
his
pocket
which
would
hang
a
man
or
save
a
man
i
found
that
out
at
all
events
so
you
may
go
and
tell
him
that
if
he
does
choose
before
night
at
ten
to
pay
down
two
hundred
pound
in
golden
sovereigns
in
this
here
parlour
i
pitch
the
and
everything
in
it
into
that
fire
then
he
may
find
his
neck
twisted
some
day
before
he
knows
what
he
about
so
he
better
mind
what
he
doing
that
all
i
do
know
anything
of
what
in
the
book
answered
the
pedlar
who
was
a
little
anxious
to
hear
more
i
know
there
are
things
in
it
worth
having
but
that
all
i
heard
about
it
i
know
too
that
if
i
go
back
without
it
you
will
have
the
beaks
put
upon
the
scent
and
they
soon
have
it
one
way
or
another
as
you
know
well
think
a
hundred
pound
worth
having
if
you
do
say
that
again
said
the
man
with
a
threatening
look
and
holding
the
between
his
finger
and
thumb
as
if
he
were
about
to
throw
it
into
the
fire
you
do
know
but
what
in
this
book
might
save
the
fellow
from
dancing
a
hornpipe
upon
nothing
and
his
worth
more
than
a
couple
of
hundreds
i
should
think
if
you
like
to
promise
upon
your
life
and
soul
to
go
and
get
me
a
couple
of
hundred
i
wait
till
if
not
here
goes
come
come
sam
said
the
dealer
in
marine
stores
do
put
yourself
in
a
passion
i
dare
say
the
gentleman
will
do
reasonable
well
then
let
him
go
and
bring
me
the
tin
cried
the
other
in
a
surly
tone
but
the
moment
after
with
an
eager
gesture
he
beckoned
the
master
of
the
house
to
him
demanding
in
a
low
voice
who
the
devil
that
mingy
walking
up
and
down
in
the
court
that
the
third
time
he
passed
the
master
of
the
house
immediately
turned
his
eyes
to
the
window
and
his
cheek
became
a
little
whiter
why
why
he
said
in
a
faltering
tone
that
jones
the
constable
i
say
sam
you
had
better
take
the
gentleman
offer
come
come
let
him
have
the
book
you
know
worse
may
come
of
it
d
n
me
if
he
shall
cried
the
ruffian
pitching
the
at
once
into
the
midst
of
the
fire
he
shall
neither
have
it
nor
me
that
the
only
thing
to
show
against
me
and
there
it
goes
d
n
you
stand
off
he
continued
snatching
up
the
poker
and
planting
himself
in
the
way
as
both
the
pedlar
and
mingy
bowes
were
starting
forward
to
snatch
the
from
the
fire
if
you
try
to
touch
it
make
your
brains
fly
about
there
you
may
go
and
tell
him
what
you
done
by
bringing
a
blackguard
like
that
to
walk
up
and
down
the
court
you
think
yourself
safe
enough
master
but
i
have
a
turn
out
of
you
yet
some
of
these
days
i
a
great
mind
to
have
it
now
whatever
may
come
of
it
so
you
had
better
be
off
as
fast
as
possible
the
pedlar
thought
so
too
and
moved
towards
the
door
but
when
he
had
reached
it
and
got
the
handle
of
the
lock
in
his
hand
he
turned
round
saying
you
a
fool
and
have
lost
a
good
hundred
pound
as
to
the
fellow
walking
before
the
window
i
never
saw
him
in
my
life
and
he
may
be
the
constable
or
the
for
aught
i
know
so
you
have
spoiled
your
own
market
and
are
a
fool
for
your
pains
the
man
sprang
at
him
like
a
tiger
but
joshua
snatched
up
a
heavy
chair
and
threw
it
against
his
shins
with
such
force
as
to
send
him
hopping
about
the
room
in
agony
during
which
time
the
pedlar
escaped
into
the
outer
shop
and
thence
into
the
street
without
waiting
to
take
leave
of
mingy
bowes
no
attempt
was
made
to
pursue
him
though
the
ruffian
in
the
long
loose
coat
continued
to
swear
most
vehemently
and
rub
his
shins
to
allay
the
pain
he
still
suffered
the
dealer
in
marine
stores
at
the
same
time
carefully
locked
the
door
of
the
back
room
in
which
they
were
and
then
opened
the
iron
door
of
a
tall
cupboard
which
seemed
destined
as
a
place
of
security
for
the
most
valuable
articles
he
possessed
on
the
various
shelves
indeed
which
were
all
of
the
same
metal
as
the
door
appeared
a
number
of
rare
and
curious
articles
which
no
one
would
have
expected
to
find
in
a
little
shop
in
the
back
street
of
a
country
town
he
paused
not
however
to
contemplate
his
treasures
but
with
a
rapid
and
quiet
motion
though
with
strength
greater
than
he
seemed
to
possess
laid
hold
of
the
middle
shelf
and
pulled
hard
the
whole
of
the
iron
lining
of
the
cupboard
with
the
contents
instantly
moved
forward
apparently
rolling
upon
castors
till
the
back
was
what
builders
would
call
flush
with
the
wall
a
very
slight
effort
then
turned
the
whole
of
this
moveable
case
round
upon
a
pivot
in
the
right
hand
corner
leaving
not
only
the
aperture
which
it
had
previously
filled
exposed
to
the
eye
but
a
considerable
depth
beyond
apparently
a
passage
to
some
other
part
of
the
building
there
get
in
sam
said
mingy
bowes
hide
away
for
a
minute
or
two
and
i
see
what
that
fellow
jones
is
about
out
there
his
companion
did
not
seem
at
all
surprised
at
anything
that
he
saw
or
heard
but
hobbled
into
the
vacant
space
in
the
wall
as
if
he
were
as
fond
of
a
burrow
as
a
rabbit
bowes
rolled
back
the
iron
cupboard
into
its
proper
place
and
shut
the
door
upon
it
and
the
room
having
resumed
its
ordinary
appearance
he
issued
forth
through
the
shop
into
the
street
and
speedily
found
his
way
to
the
back
lane
which
the
constable
was
still
perambulating
good
morning
jones
he
said
with
a
look
of
haste
and
eagerness
have
you
seen
a
stout
man
in
a
brown
coat
with
grey
stockings
and
gaiters
just
pass
by
no
answered
the
constable
no
man
has
come
this
way
you
had
better
look
after
him
if
he
does
said
mingy
bowes
for
he
came
offering
me
things
to
sell
which
i
did
choose
to
buy
i
sure
he
stolen
them
and
i
thought
you
might
be
watching
for
him
oh
no
answered
the
constable
i
looking
for
young
wilson
who
lives
up
there
in
number
four
he
came
home
drunk
last
night
and
thrashed
his
wife
till
she
was
nearly
dead
she
was
taken
to
the
hospital
this
morning
and
as
the
surgeon
says
she
in
great
danger
the
magistrates
will
have
him
up
he
keeping
out
of
the
way
however
but
he
be
starved
home
soon
for
he
has
a
penny
in
his
pocket
and
nobody
will
trust
him
i
sure
mingy
bowes
laughed
and
the
constable
laughed
for
there
are
some
people
to
whom
sorrows
which
would
make
most
men
melancholy
and
crimes
which
ought
to
make
all
men
melancholy
are
very
good
jokes
bowes
was
well
satisfied
too
with
the
information
although
upon
other
points
he
was
a
little
inclined
to
be
sulky
hurrying
home
again
he
soon
set
free
his
concealed
companion
who
had
by
this
time
recovered
from
the
blow
upon
his
shins
and
who
now
walked
quietly
i
might
say
absently
to
the
fire
and
took
his
old
seat
again
but
bowes
was
not
well
pleased
with
him
and
proceeded
to
read
him
a
lecture
i
wonder
how
you
can
be
such
a
fool
sam
he
said
jones
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
cove
who
was
here
just
now
he
looking
for
young
wilson
and
just
because
you
thought
it
was
a
trap
you
must
go
and
throw
the
into
the
fire
when
you
might
have
got
a
hundred
pound
for
it
now
you
done
for
yourself
the
gentleman
will
put
the
beaks
upon
you
and
they
soon
nab
you
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
dare
said
the
other
with
a
twist
of
his
mouth
and
you
a
fool
mingy
for
talking
about
what
you
do
understand
not
so
great
a
fool
as
you
answered
mingy
bowes
boldly
for
what
was
the
use
of
burning
the
book
that
was
no
good
at
all
whatever
you
intend
to
do
you
might
as
well
have
kept
it
there
you
out
said
the
other
was
the
very
best
thing
i
could
do
with
it
you
not
up
to
snuff
yet
master
mingy
i
can
tell
you
i
did
read
what
was
in
the
book
for
nothing
and
i
got
this
young
fellow
whoever
he
is
in
a
vice
that
squeeze
him
pretty
hard
as
you
see
before
long
i
could
hang
him
if
i
liked
though
that
indeed
would
be
no
great
good
to
me
or
anybody
else
but
i
sweat
him
notwithstanding
i
do
understand
said
mingy
bowes
if
you
could
hang
him
he
could
hang
you
i
fancy
and
that
would
suit
you
master
sam
at
least
i
should
think
not
no
certainly
replied
the
other
man
but
i
let
you
know
all
how
it
is
master
bowes
for
you
must
give
me
some
help
and
he
proceeded
to
explain
to
the
receiver
of
stolen
goods
that
he
had
found
in
the
that
paper
which
had
been
given
by
hayley
to
his
son
just
on
the
eve
of
henry
flight
from
england
and
which
has
already
been
laid
before
the
reader
it
is
true
the
man
knew
nothing
of
the
story
or
if
he
ever
had
heard
anything
of
it
had
forgotten
it
altogether
but
the
paper
itself
showed
that
a
forgery
had
been
committed
and
that
the
document
had
been
given
to
exculpate
in
case
of
need
one
who
had
voluntarily
borne
the
imputation
of
the
crime
to
save
a
parent
the
names
were
there
before
him
and
consequently
so
far
as
the
past
was
concerned
he
had
full
information
then
as
to
the
present
and
the
means
of
connecting
the
history
of
henry
hayley
with
the
personage
who
had
been
robbed
on
the
preceding
night
there
were
several
papers
comprising
letters
addressed
to
colonel
middleton
at
a
hotel
in
london
and
some
memoranda
of
things
to
be
done
which
without
any
great
stretch
of
imagination
might
be
discovered
to
apply
to
the
other
paper
referring
to
the
forgery
as
i
may
have
to
notice
the
contents
of
that
hereafter
i
will
not
pause
longer
upon
them
now
but
merely
say
that
the
explanation
of
his
worthy
friend
was
quite
satisfactory
to
mingy
bowes
and
that
he
applied
himself
with
due
zeal
and
diligence
to
concoct
with
samuel
a
plan
for
their
future
proceedings
in
the
execution
of
which
he
flattered
himself
he
might
obtain
even
more
than
he
should
have
gained
by
his
commission
had
the
hundred
pounds
offered
by
the
pedlar
been
accepted
without
hesitation
there
then
for
the
present
we
will
leave
them
perfectly
satisfied
as
they
were
that
they
had
got
a
firm
hold
upon
a
victim
who
would
not
be
able
to
escape
from
their
clutches
till
they
had
drained
him
as
dry
as
hay
chapter
xxi
henry
hayley
did
not
forget
his
promise
and
by
eleven
was
sitting
by
the
side
of
winkworth
who
had
on
that
day
for
the
first
time
come
to
breakfast
in
the
of
the
hotel
which
had
been
appropriated
to
charles
marston
and
himself
charles
was
seated
at
a
table
at
some
distance
writing
a
letter
and
the
old
gentleman
was
reposing
upon
a
sofa
after
the
fatigue
of
the
meal
he
was
somewhat
paler
and
not
quite
so
yellow
as
when
henry
had
last
seen
him
but
certainly
his
whimsicality
and
petulance
did
not
seem
to
have
at
all
diminished
during
the
illness
and
suffering
he
had
lately
undergone
he
was
very
glad
to
see
his
young
acquaintance
however
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
and
seemed
more
gay
and
lively
than
he
had
been
during
the
morning
well
colonel
he
said
i
wanted
very
much
to
see
you
to
ask
you
a
question
you
are
a
military
man
have
been
in
service
some
years
seven
i
think
you
told
me
once
and
have
doubtless
been
in
a
good
number
of
engagements
now
tell
me
were
you
ever
wounded
henry
pointed
to
a
scar
on
his
cheek
replying
only
once
my
dear
sir
and
that
very
slightly
now
see
what
a
whimsical
jade
fortune
is
exclaimed
winkworth
you
go
about
the
world
for
seven
years
seeking
wounds
and
bruises
it
is
your
trade
your
profession
the
object
of
your
life
to
get
shot
or
slashed
or
poked
with
a
pike
and
you
receive
nothing
but
a
scratch
on
the
face
while
i
whose
business
it
is
to
avoid
such
things
who
hate
war
and
bloodshed
and
strife
in
all
shapes
and
have
an
especial
objection
to
being
wounded
at
all
can
not
travel
for
a
year
to
see
sights
in
the
most
pacific
guise
and
manner
without
getting
twice
shot
and
once
nearly
killed
these
things
certainly
are
very
unaccountable
said
henry
hayley
i
have
known
two
men
one
of
whom
never
went
into
battle
without
getting
wounded
while
the
other
appeared
to
bear
a
charm
which
seemed
to
turn
steel
and
lead
aside
and
yet
he
perhaps
exposed
himself
more
than
the
other
but
it
is
not
only
between
two
men
that
the
whimsical
harridan
plays
her
tricks
said
winkworth
it
is
even
between
two
shoulders
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
what
my
unfortunate
left
shoulder
has
done
to
offend
her
or
why
the
right
one
has
not
quite
as
good
a
title
to
be
wounded
as
the
other
but
certain
it
is
the
same
poor
suffering
fellow
comes
in
for
every
bad
thing
that
is
going
while
the
other
lolls
comfortably
at
his
ease
and
never
even
sends
round
to
ask
after
his
brother
health
i
trust
however
from
what
i
see
replied
henry
that
neither
has
suffered
very
much
this
time
my
good
sir
and
that
you
will
soon
be
better
i
do
know
i
do
know
replied
winkworth
if
the
doctors
will
let
me
alone
and
that
boy
does
not
tease
me
to
death
i
dare
say
i
shall
do
very
well
but
there
a
great
chance
of
one
or
the
other
killing
me
if
i
am
fool
enough
to
let
them
charles
looked
up
from
his
writing
hearing
this
attack
upon
himself
saying
heaven
knows
my
dear
winkworth
i
have
not
been
teasing
you
except
to
get
you
to
do
what
the
surgeon
bids
you
well
is
not
that
enough
exclaimed
winkworth
with
a
smile
why
should
you
tease
me
to
do
what
i
know
to
be
wrong
to
follow
the
directions
of
a
man
in
whom
i
have
no
confidence
or
to
bathe
my
shoulder
morning
noon
and
night
with
a
lotion
that
only
does
it
harm
while
plain
is
making
it
quite
well
no
no
thank
heaven
i
am
not
old
enough
or
fool
enough
or
young
enough
or
mad
enough
to
put
any
confidence
in
doctors
who
go
groping
in
the
dark
and
kill
a
great
many
more
than
they
cure
besides
you
have
been
teasing
me
about
a
great
number
of
other
things
did
you
not
tell
me
just
now
that
your
father
was
in
the
that
was
enough
to
tease
any
friend
of
yours
and
then
to
see
you
take
it
so
quietly
and
jauntily
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
no
moment
at
all
is
enough
to
drive
one
mad
i
sure
your
good
uncle
scriven
does
not
look
upon
it
so
lightly
certainly
not
answered
charles
marston
but
then
in
the
first
place
the
mind
of
my
good
uncle
is
of
a
very
different
complexion
from
mine
and
in
the
next
place
he
does
not
know
a
great
many
things
which
i
do
and
which
greatly
tend
to
alleviate
the
matter
at
all
events
one
thing
is
a
great
comfort
come
what
will
my
father
never
can
be
in
want
for
the
generous
settlement
he
made
upon
me
long
ago
guards
him
now
against
that
and
i
have
other
things
to
tell
him
which
i
trust
will
wipe
away
all
memory
of
the
disappointment
and
sorrow
which
this
event
must
have
caused
him
ho
ho
secrets
exclaimed
winkworth
while
henry
hayley
looked
at
his
friend
with
a
kind
but
very
meaning
smile
if
the
secrets
be
worth
knowing
i
will
find
them
out
i
have
all
the
curiosity
of
an
old
bachelor
or
an
old
maid
i
can
tell
you
and
i
will
answer
for
it
master
charles
i
shall
be
in
possession
of
the
whole
intelligence
before
your
letter
reaches
calcutta
that
is
very
likely
my
dear
sir
answered
charles
for
in
the
first
place
the
secret
will
soon
be
very
well
known
and
i
promise
you
shall
be
one
of
the
first
to
hear
it
and
in
the
next
place
there
is
little
chance
of
my
letter
going
to
calcutta
at
all
for
scriven
tells
me
my
father
is
on
his
way
to
england
i
wonder
i
have
not
heard
myself
then
where
do
you
intend
to
send
your
letter
asked
henry
hayley
in
some
surprise
if
your
father
is
on
his
way
it
will
most
likely
miss
him
i
shall
send
it
to
his
agents
at
liverpool
answered
charles
he
may
get
it
or
not
before
he
reaches
london
but
when
i
can
testify
my
gratitude
for
all
his
kindness
and
my
affection
for
all
his
worth
and
perhaps
soothe
his
grief
and
relieve
his
anxiety
i
will
not
delay
an
hour
though
you
know
middleton
i
hate
writing
letters
i
know
all
about
it
said
winkworth
starting
as
if
from
a
deep
reverie
i
have
fathomed
your
secret
i
have
made
it
all
out
hazel
eyes
an
oval
face
a
straight
little
nose
lips
running
over
with
fun
and
impertinence
i
made
it
out
i
made
it
out
master
charles
a
lady
sir
said
a
waiter
entering
and
addressing
winkworth
wishes
to
know
if
she
can
see
you
her
card
air
she
waiting
in
the
carriage
below
a
lady
exclaimed
winkworth
taking
the
card
good
heaven
have
they
found
me
out
already
what
terrible
women
these
europeans
are
they
can
not
let
an
old
bachelor
live
in
peace
amongst
them
for
three
days
without
attacking
the
citadel
of
his
heart
with
all
the
forms
of
war
lady
anne
mellent
present
my
most
humble
and
respectful
compliments
to
her
ladyship
and
say
that
i
am
forbidden
by
the
laws
and
ordinances
of
hippocrates
to
descend
to
the
door
of
her
vehicle
but
that
if
she
will
do
me
the
honour
of
walking
up
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
her
that
waiter
always
made
a
point
of
staring
very
much
at
winkworth
and
of
thinking
him
the
most
extraordinary
man
in
the
world
however
he
retreated
speedily
and
in
a
moment
or
two
after
returned
announcing
lady
anne
she
entered
with
a
gay
and
laughing
look
her
colour
a
little
heightened
and
a
bonnet
which
became
her
exceedingly
so
that
certainly
if
she
had
any
designs
upon
the
old
gentleman
heart
her
forces
were
well
prepared
for
action
winkworth
however
though
occasionally
a
little
bitter
and
sarcastic
upon
the
fair
sex
was
the
pink
of
politeness
and
courtesy
in
his
demeanour
towards
them
and
rising
from
the
sofa
he
met
lady
anne
near
the
door
and
taking
her
hand
gallantly
pressed
his
lips
upon
the
tips
of
her
fingers
saying
this
is
indeed
a
great
and
unexpected
favour
my
dear
lady
anne
and
i
am
quite
as
grateful
for
it
allow
me
to
assure
you
as
if
i
had
been
impudent
enough
to
ask
it
and
you
had
been
cruel
enough
to
hesitate
for
a
month
an
excellent
beginning
winkworth
said
lady
anne
for
i
am
going
at
once
to
put
your
gratitude
to
the
test
you
will
think
me
somewhat
exacting
but
still
i
will
prove
your
sincerity
i
am
going
to
have
a
party
to
spend
a
week
down
at
a
place
of
mine
in
the
north
some
very
pleasant
people
are
to
be
there
i
can
assure
you
one
colonel
middleton
and
she
turned
a
laughing
look
towards
henry
then
added
nodding
her
head
to
charles
one
marston
besides
an
exceedingly
pretty
girl
called
maria
monkton
and
the
dearest
and
best
of
old
ladies
in
the
world
lady
fleetwood
who
would
fain
remain
behind
in
london
having
an
infinity
of
things
to
do
but
whom
i
am
determined
to
have
down
with
me
just
to
keep
her
out
of
harm
way
now
winkworth
you
must
be
one
of
the
party
and
i
promise
you
i
will
flirt
all
day
with
you
except
when
i
am
coquetting
a
little
with
colonel
middleton
or
charles
marston
humph
said
winkworth
i
suppose
that
with
ladies
speeches
as
with
their
letters
the
pith
lies
in
the
postscript
and
he
turned
a
keen
look
from
her
face
to
that
of
charles
their
speeches
and
their
letters
both
deserve
an
answer
at
all
events
replied
lady
anne
and
i
think
you
very
rude
winkworth
for
making
a
saucy
speech
about
ladies
postscripts
instead
of
catching
at
my
invitation
with
due
reverence
and
delight
i
will
atone
i
will
atone
said
the
old
gentleman
not
only
by
accepting
immediately
but
by
speaking
nothing
but
soft
and
complimentary
speeches
all
the
time
i
am
your
guest
but
you
must
give
me
a
few
days
to
recover
my
dear
young
lady
for
you
see
here
i
am
forbidden
to
set
a
foot
out
of
doors
for
the
next
three
days
oh
yes
answered
lady
anne
charles
marston
knows
all
the
arrangements
and
will
bring
you
down
at
the
proper
time
and
season
like
a
tame
bear
in
a
said
winkworth
however
dear
lady
anne
as
i
said
before
i
do
my
best
to
stand
upon
my
hind
legs
and
behave
civilly
to
all
men
you
wo
be
half
so
delightful
at
any
time
as
when
you
growl
answered
lady
anne
laughing
but
come
colonel
middleton
i
intend
to
take
you
away
with
me
charles
looked
up
with
a
feeling
of
mortification
which
he
could
not
altogether
banish
from
his
face
and
lady
anne
saw
it
odd
as
she
was
and
accustomed
to
indulge
every
fancy
without
restraint
she
nevertheless
understood
sufficiently
well
the
nature
and
feelings
of
love
to
know
that
she
was
putting
charles
marston
to
a
sore
trial
and
to
be
sorry
for
it
however
she
might
still
have
persevered
for
many
motives
induced
her
to
do
so
had
not
winkworth
suddenly
turned
an
inquiring
and
almost
sarcastic
look
to
charles
face
which
lady
anne
chose
to
interpret
is
this
the
way
she
treats
you
that
look
decided
lady
anne
at
once
she
could
bear
to
tease
charles
marston
a
little
she
could
bear
even
to
put
his
confidence
in
her
affection
and
constancy
to
a
very
painful
ordeal
but
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
making
charles
seem
contemptible
in
the
eyes
of
any
one
even
for
his
complaisance
to
her
as
soon
then
as
she
had
drawn
on
her
glove
she
went
up
to
the
table
where
charles
was
sitting
and
laid
her
hand
with
the
most
undisguised
affection
on
his
shoulder
can
you
come
with
us
charles
she
said
slightly
bending
her
head
and
looking
down
into
his
face
with
infinite
grace
both
in
the
attitude
of
her
figure
and
the
expression
of
her
countenance
or
must
you
stay
and
finish
this
long
letter
to
whom
is
it
it
is
too
long
to
be
to
a
man
and
i
do
allow
you
to
write
to
any
other
woman
without
first
obtaining
my
consent
it
is
to
my
father
dear
lady
anne
answered
charles
marston
but
it
can
be
finished
any
time
before
six
this
evening
well
then
come
with
me
she
replied
but
remember
i
do
permit
you
to
call
me
lady
anne
you
may
make
it
anne
if
you
like
or
anne
mellent
or
anne
anything
you
please
but
drop
the
or
you
shall
be
marston
esquire
with
me
for
the
future
charles
started
up
to
get
his
hat
which
polished
by
the
care
of
his
servant
till
it
shone
like
a
mirror
lay
with
his
gloves
and
stick
on
a
small
table
behind
him
and
lady
anne
turning
again
to
winkworth
observed
you
think
me
very
odd
i
am
sure
winkworth
but
it
all
proceeds
from
nature
habit
and
calculation
and
you
find
me
ten
times
odder
than
you
now
think
when
you
known
me
a
little
longer
i
do
think
you
very
odd
said
winkworth
with
a
gay
look
but
very
charming
there
that
the
first
of
the
civil
speeches
said
lady
anne
that
do
for
winkworth
no
more
of
them
yes
one
more
rejoined
the
old
gentleman
one
more
you
two
young
men
go
away
and
leave
this
gay
lady
with
me
i
am
going
to
make
her
a
declaration
so
stay
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
for
fear
she
should
faint
with
a
smile
charles
marston
and
henry
hayley
did
as
they
were
bid
while
lady
anne
advanced
towards
winkworth
saying
what
can
you
want
with
me
you
very
funny
old
man
the
answer
they
did
not
hear
but
when
in
about
two
minutes
lady
anne
rejoined
them
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
her
cheeks
bore
traces
of
the
same
dew
of
the
heart
her
manner
however
was
too
gay
and
sparkling
for
those
tears
to
be
tears
of
grief
and
when
charles
asked
her
what
had
happened
to
move
her
so
much
she
answered
playfully
there
charles
not
a
word
he
an
excellent
old
man
that
and
he
loves
you
and
will
do
for
you
more
than
you
know
but
now
let
us
on
our
way
i
am
first
going
to
my
own
house
for
a
little
and
then
to
dear
aunt
fleetwood
so
you
shall
go
with
me
to
both
places
chapter
xxii
leaving
the
lady
and
the
two
gentlemen
to
follow
whatever
path
the
gay
and
somewhat
capricious
elf
who
ruled
the
whims
of
lady
anne
mellent
chose
to
dictate
we
will
with
the
reader
good
leave
stay
a
little
with
winkworth
to
whom
we
have
not
been
altogether
as
civil
as
we
might
have
been
we
have
left
him
alone
weary
and
wounded
with
very
little
to
do
though
a
good
deal
to
think
about
now
to
say
truth
the
fact
of
having
a
good
deal
to
think
about
is
not
in
general
a
source
of
consolation
to
a
sick
or
wounded
man
unless
it
be
of
so
important
and
pressing
a
nature
as
to
postpone
corporeal
suffering
or
mental
occupation
a
general
somewhat
smartly
wounded
may
go
through
a
battle
hardly
discovering
the
injury
he
has
received
for
the
immense
interests
that
press
upon
the
mind
withdraw
all
attention
from
the
body
pain
but
were
he
to
be
carried
to
the
rear
to
know
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
to
receive
no
momentary
excitement
to
have
no
engrossing
object
pressed
upon
his
attention
every
instant
the
very
pangs
which
would
have
been
unfelt
in
the
fiery
interests
of
an
fight
would
now
in
idleness
weigh
down
the
very
spirit
which
in
activity
would
have
subdued
them
were
you
ever
wounded
reader
i
mean
something
of
course
more
serious
than
the
cut
of
the
schoolboy
knife
or
any
of
the
little
ordinary
accidents
of
civilian
life
if
you
have
you
will
know
that
though
sometimes
for
a
minute
or
two
you
are
hardly
aware
that
you
are
injured
yet
gradually
very
unpleasant
sensations
succeed
to
the
first
numbing
effects
of
the
wound
a
burning
heat
a
swollen
and
tingling
stiffness
of
all
the
neighbouring
parts
come
on
a
sort
of
horny
sensation
as
if
the
whole
flesh
around
were
changed
into
an
exceedingly
sensitive
but
cartilaginous
substance
gradually
the
inflammation
affects
the
constitution
the
whole
frame
sympathises
with
the
wounded
part
the
stomach
turns
sick
and
weary
the
head
aches
the
limbs
are
full
of
lassitude
at
the
same
time
the
spirit
sinks
terribly
at
least
in
ordinary
cases
amusements
occupations
which
we
were
once
fond
of
afford
us
relaxation
no
longer
and
that
terrible
symptom
which
doctors
call
precordial
anxiety
deprives
us
of
rest
and
tranquillity
the
latter
miseries
winkworth
had
been
spared
though
he
felt
all
the
first
five
or
six
in
the
catalogue
his
constitution
so
far
sympathised
with
the
local
action
that
he
occasionally
felt
sick
had
a
distaste
to
all
sorts
of
food
and
held
tea
of
which
he
was
usually
very
fond
in
utter
abhorrence
his
spirits
did
not
flag
however
for
they
were
of
a
very
active
and
untiring
nature
they
had
borne
him
through
a
good
many
sorrows
which
he
had
felt
very
keenly
but
which
he
had
never
suffered
to
cast
him
down
thus
with
a
book
which
he
changed
as
often
as
he
found
it
tiresome
and
with
a
pen
and
ink
which
he
employed
not
unfrequently
and
with
thoughts
which
he
occupied
on
subjects
totally
different
from
his
own
situation
he
had
contrived
to
wear
away
the
time
between
sleep
and
sleep
without
much
weariness
when
he
was
now
once
more
left
alone
after
lady
anne
and
her
two
companions
had
departed
winkworth
sat
for
a
few
moments
on
the
sofa
and
then
rising
his
left
arm
supported
by
a
sling
to
relieve
the
wounded
shoulder
of
the
weight
walked
several
times
up
and
down
the
room
she
is
a
very
charming
girl
indeed
he
said
or
rather
murmured
for
the
words
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
been
spoken
and
he
is
a
very
lucky
lad
she
will
not
be
unhappy
either
for
i
do
not
know
a
better
or
a
kinder
disposition
than
his
with
abundant
wealth
good
health
and
good
tempers
there
is
every
earthly
prospect
of
happiness
god
will
of
course
temper
it
as
he
mercifully
tempers
all
lots
lest
man
should
become
it
is
needful
that
alloy
of
grief
and
disappointment
as
needful
as
the
baser
metal
mingled
with
the
gold
lest
it
should
be
too
soft
and
wear
away
too
rapidly
it
is
needful
for
if
we
found
perfect
happiness
here
how
terrible
would
be
the
summons
to
leave
it
all
for
the
untried
hereafter
yet
this
business
of
the
bankruptcy
seems
to
have
shaken
him
a
good
deal
not
for
himself
that
is
evident
for
as
to
his
own
fate
he
is
full
of
high
hopes
i
must
try
to
cheer
him
on
that
well
well
he
turned
sharply
round
for
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
behind
him
and
the
voice
of
the
waiter
said
there
is
a
lad
sir
below
who
says
you
told
him
to
come
here
and
that
you
intend
to
make
a
servant
of
him
i
should
have
sent
him
away
but
he
has
got
a
paper
with
your
name
which
he
says
you
wrote
send
him
up
said
winkworth
and
then
added
speaking
to
himself
the
young
man
has
been
somewhat
tardy
i
must
lecture
him
for
diligence
and
attention
i
will
have
and
if
he
begins
thus
how
will
he
go
on
a
moment
after
jim
brown
was
ushered
into
the
room
with
a
bundle
under
his
arm
wrapped
up
in
a
piece
of
an
old
cashmere
shawl
some
country
boys
finding
themselves
for
the
first
time
in
the
of
a
london
hotel
would
have
gazed
round
at
the
various
objects
it
contained
with
bumpkin
amazement
and
in
the
present
instance
it
might
have
been
very
excusable
to
do
so
for
besides
the
ordinary
ornaments
of
the
room
there
were
enormous
numbers
of
different
articles
all
strange
to
the
boy
eyes
and
of
the
most
miscellaneous
character
that
it
is
possible
to
conceive
charles
marston
had
more
than
half
filled
it
with
things
of
bronze
marble
alabaster
painted
canvass
and
carved
oak
from
france
italy
and
greece
together
with
greek
and
albanian
dresses
syrian
carpets
turbans
caps
sabres
yataghans
and
other
things
which
would
extend
the
catalogue
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
winkworth
himself
though
he
had
travelled
with
but
little
baggage
and
had
not
opened
a
tenth
part
of
the
cases
which
were
awaiting
his
arrival
had
contrived
to
get
out
a
number
of
hookahs
and
long
pipes
with
not
a
few
commodities
from
india
burmah
and
ceylon
jim
brown
however
did
nothing
of
the
kind
that
he
was
a
rude
uncultivated
country
boy
i
do
not
mean
to
deny
but
he
possessed
that
peculiar
characteristic
which
i
look
upon
as
one
of
the
most
valuable
qualities
when
guided
by
good
judgment
with
which
any
human
being
can
be
gifted
a
quality
which
in
dealing
with
the
world
at
large
sooner
or
later
overbears
all
the
impediments
which
lie
in
the
way
of
success
the
prejudices
the
inattention
the
indifference
the
very
reason
in
many
instances
of
our
and
which
in
its
action
upon
ourselves
is
no
less
triumphant
overbearing
the
most
intrusive
of
all
our
weaknesses
the
thought
of
self
the
quality
he
possessed
was
earnestness
earnestness
of
purpose
earnestness
of
thought
earnestness
of
feeling
if
it
could
not
be
called
the
great
principle
of
his
nature
it
was
at
all
events
the
great
quality
of
his
character
and
it
subdued
all
things
within
him
to
itself
he
looked
not
round
the
room
for
one
moment
his
eyes
instantly
fixed
upon
winkworth
and
he
advanced
straight
towards
him
his
mind
bent
upon
one
subject
too
resolutely
to
stray
to
any
other
the
old
gentleman
brow
was
rather
cloudy
when
he
entered
and
as
we
have
seen
he
meditated
a
reproof
but
he
was
a
good
deal
of
a
physiognomist
and
as
he
marked
the
expression
of
the
countenance
he
said
to
himself
he
is
about
to
assign
a
reason
or
make
an
apology
or
show
a
motive
for
his
delay
let
us
hear
what
he
has
to
say
for
himself
and
he
remained
silent
sir
i
intended
to
have
been
here
before
now
said
the
boy
when
he
had
come
within
two
or
three
feet
of
the
sofa
he
did
not
know
that
according
to
rule
he
should
have
staid
a
good
deal
nearer
the
door
i
was
afraid
you
would
be
angry
but
then
i
thought
when
you
heard
why
i
staid
you
would
forgive
me
you
see
sir
when
they
took
away
poor
bessy
they
took
all
the
things
of
hers
they
could
find
and
some
of
mine
too
i
thought
they
had
taken
all
but
when
i
came
to
put
the
place
in
order
that
i
might
come
away
here
i
found
a
whole
heap
more
of
her
things
and
a
good
many
papers
of
hers
hid
away
under
the
bed
i
took
them
away
to
our
parson
to
ask
him
to
keep
them
for
her
but
he
was
out
and
not
likely
to
come
back
so
i
had
my
eight
miles
walk
for
nothing
the
coach
passed
a
little
earlier
than
usual
and
so
i
missed
it
that
day
and
the
next
day
joshua
brown
advised
me
to
bring
on
the
things
to
you
and
give
them
into
your
care
and
also
to
ask
at
all
the
which
he
and
i
passed
where
the
gentleman
had
taken
poor
bessy
that
when
i
came
i
might
know
and
be
able
to
tell
you
where
she
is
for
you
and
the
other
gentleman
seemed
to
think
a
good
deal
about
her
this
kept
me
so
long
but
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
well
well
reasons
sufficient
replied
winkworth
i
like
punctuality
my
good
lad
but
i
not
altogether
a
hard
taskmaster
and
so
you
have
brought
the
poor
woman
things
here
have
you
are
they
in
that
bundle
yes
sir
replied
the
boy
laying
the
things
down
upon
the
table
and
i
got
a
little
gold
box
in
my
pocket
too
belonging
to
her
with
what
joshua
brown
says
are
diamonds
on
the
top
let
me
see
let
me
see
said
winkworth
and
the
lad
immediately
produced
from
his
pocket
the
vinaigrette
which
he
had
previously
shown
to
the
pedlar
and
placed
it
in
winkworth
hands
all
fashions
have
their
day
and
pass
away
sometimes
giving
place
to
things
better
than
themselves
sometimes
to
worse
even
the
workmanship
in
hard
metal
is
subjected
to
the
capricious
rule
and
the
fashion
of
gold
and
silver
seldom
lasts
above
two
or
three
years
it
is
very
probable
however
that
some
of
my
readers
may
have
seen
snuffboxes
lockets
and
cases
for
miniatures
ay
or
even
vinaigrettes
which
displayed
on
one
side
or
the
other
a
tablet
of
bright
blue
enamel
on
which
appeared
a
cipher
formed
of
diamonds
the
top
of
the
box
now
produced
was
thus
ornamented
and
winkworth
examining
it
closely
said
very
fine
stones
indeed
what
can
that
mean
charles
assured
me
that
her
name
was
hayley
so
it
is
sir
replied
jim
for
the
gentleman
who
took
her
away
called
her
miss
hayley
i
do
understand
it
said
winkworth
now
then
let
us
look
at
these
in
the
bundle
and
he
untied
the
corners
when
a
mass
of
very
miscellaneous
articles
displayed
itself
amongst
which
there
appeared
none
that
could
be
of
any
great
value
except
one
or
two
packets
of
written
papers
rolled
up
in
small
bundles
and
tied
with
dirty
pieces
of
ribbon
one
seemed
to
consist
of
letters
which
had
been
transmitted
by
the
post
for
on
the
outer
cover
there
was
an
address
with
the
official
stamp
the
others
seemed
to
consist
of
manuscripts
without
any
direction
or
indication
of
the
contents
upon
the
outside
but
were
written
very
closely
in
a
good
clear
masculine
hand
winkworth
paused
and
gazed
at
the
papers
for
a
moment
or
two
as
if
in
doubt
and
hesitation
then
turning
to
the
boy
he
asked
can
you
tell
me
what
these
packets
contain
jim
brown
no
sir
answered
the
boy
i
did
not
open
them
for
i
thought
i
had
no
business
right
said
winkworth
right
now
jim
i
should
like
very
much
to
open
them
from
various
motives
some
of
which
you
can
conceive
and
some
of
which
you
can
not
i
should
like
to
see
this
poor
history
which
is
most
probably
herein
written
i
should
like
to
know
what
brought
her
to
madness
destitution
and
solitary
wandering
moreover
there
is
a
chance
that
by
something
contained
in
these
papers
we
might
learn
how
her
condition
could
be
ameliorated
and
who
are
the
relations
and
friends
who
might
have
a
right
to
take
care
of
her
in
her
present
condition
and
provide
for
her
future
comfort
that
chance
would
afford
a
good
excuse
to
many
men
for
examining
these
documents
but
a
man
of
honour
and
honesty
jim
will
be
always
very
scrupulous
in
satisfying
himself
that
there
is
something
more
than
an
excuse
nay
a
full
justification
for
doing
that
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
be
dishonourable
now
the
man
or
woman
jim
who
would
look
into
the
private
papers
of
another
person
without
full
and
convincing
proof
that
to
do
so
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
benefit
of
that
person
is
dishonest
is
a
rogue
jim
is
one
unworthy
of
trust
or
confidence
i
have
no
such
proof
and
therefore
i
will
not
examine
these
papers
until
i
have
or
until
i
am
by
some
means
authorized
to
do
so
ring
the
bell
boy
there
it
hangs
by
the
side
of
the
fireplace
jim
in
vain
looked
for
a
bell
for
he
had
never
before
seen
a
in
his
life
and
he
took
winkworth
words
literally
supposing
that
he
should
find
a
bell
hanging
by
the
fireplace
probably
something
like
a
church
bell
for
that
was
the
instrument
of
sound
with
which
he
was
best
acquainted
i
do
see
a
bell
sir
he
said
pshaw
cried
winkworth
laughing
pull
the
rope
that
hanging
there
i
forgot
that
you
had
not
been
long
caught
the
bell
was
soon
rung
and
a
sheet
of
large
procured
in
which
the
old
gentleman
made
the
boy
fold
up
carefully
the
various
documents
he
had
brought
as
the
wound
in
his
shoulder
prevented
him
from
doing
so
himself
this
packing
up
was
very
neatly
accomplished
by
jim
but
when
it
came
to
the
sealing
notwithstanding
all
the
good
instructions
of
winkworth
who
stood
by
with
a
seal
ready
to
press
upon
the
wax
the
poor
boy
made
a
sad
mess
of
it
and
burned
his
fingers
awfully
never
mind
jim
never
mind
said
winkworth
in
my
young
days
when
people
were
in
the
habit
of
walking
the
bounds
of
the
parish
the
officers
used
to
whip
one
of
the
boys
of
the
at
every
point
which
might
become
doubtful
in
order
that
the
tail
might
help
the
head
to
recollect
now
your
fingers
will
put
you
in
mind
of
this
sealing
in
case
of
need
however
there
are
two
or
three
other
things
to
be
thought
of
have
you
found
out
where
they
have
taken
her
to
yes
sir
answered
the
boy
the
last
driver
i
talked
to
told
me
that
the
gentleman
had
ordered
him
to
go
to
a
house
with
stay
i
wrote
down
the
name
of
the
place
on
a
bit
of
paper
winkworth
eagerly
examined
the
address
the
boy
produced
brooke
green
he
said
brooke
green
that
not
far
i
a
great
mind
to
go
there
at
once
hang
the
doctors
who
cares
what
they
say
i
go
ring
the
bell
jim
the
bell
was
rung
once
more
and
the
waiter
ordered
to
have
a
pair
of
put
immediately
to
charles
marston
carriage
for
winkworth
did
not
stand
upon
any
great
ceremony
with
his
young
friend
now
take
this
boy
down
and
give
him
something
to
eat
continued
winkworth
yes
sir
said
the
waiter
you
a
respectable
man
i
think
said
the
old
gentleman
yes
sir
said
the
waiter
with
a
wife
and
children
asked
winkworth
yes
sir
said
the
waiter
then
take
care
of
that
boy
while
i
stay
here
and
see
if
you
can
not
get
him
immediately
from
some
shop
a
tidy
suit
of
clothes
and
have
him
prepared
to
go
out
with
me
in
an
hour
yes
sir
said
the
waiter
you
may
go
as
far
as
fifty
rupees
said
winkworth
yes
sir
still
said
the
waiter
though
heaven
knows
he
knew
no
more
what
a
rupee
is
than
adam
knew
what
a
wife
was
before
he
fell
asleep
in
the
garden
of
eden
winkworth
was
by
temperament
and
still
more
by
habit
somewhat
impatient
and
on
this
occasion
he
certainly
did
not
let
the
hour
pass
before
he
rang
the
bell
and
asked
if
the
horses
and
the
boy
were
ready
if
the
truth
must
be
told
he
was
apprehensive
lest
charles
marston
should
come
in
and
attempt
to
dissuade
him
from
going
out
at
all
now
there
was
nothing
on
earth
winkworth
so
much
disliked
as
being
dissuaded
for
he
always
took
his
own
way
and
a
very
odd
way
it
generally
was
so
that
he
looked
upon
any
attempt
to
dissuade
him
as
trouble
to
both
parties
without
benefit
to
either
however
it
turned
out
that
the
horses
were
ready
but
the
boy
was
not
and
he
had
to
wait
another
quarter
of
an
hour
before
jim
returned
with
the
porter
whom
the
waiter
had
sent
to
guide
him
the
moment
he
arrived
winkworth
put
him
in
the
dickey
of
the
vehicle
told
the
postboy
where
to
drive
and
got
into
the
inside
himself
just
as
he
was
whirling
round
the
corner
of
albermarle
street
into
piccadilly
who
should
he
see
walking
soberly
along
with
colonel
middleton
but
his
young
friend
charles
marston
and
with
a
laugh
at
the
consternation
which
he
saw
in
charles
countenance
he
shook
his
finger
at
him
and
rattled
on
brooke
green
was
speedily
reached
and
at
the
door
of
the
house
which
had
one
of
those
portentous
names
usually
given
to
lunatic
asylums
the
carriage
drew
up
here
however
some
difficulties
presented
themselves
for
although
winkworth
and
the
boy
were
at
once
shown
into
the
master
parlour
that
personage
demurred
to
letting
them
see
miss
hayley
though
he
did
not
venture
to
deny
that
she
was
in
the
house
though
a
very
odd
man
winkworth
in
matters
of
business
was
a
very
sensible
man
and
though
as
i
have
shown
an
impatient
man
yet
in
difficult
circumstances
strange
to
say
he
never
lost
his
temper
well
sir
he
said
i
will
ask
you
one
question
by
what
authority
do
you
detain
the
lady
here
by
sufficient
authority
for
my
justification
sir
replied
the
master
it
must
be
sufficient
for
my
satisfaction
before
i
go
hence
replied
winkworth
for
i
warn
you
i
am
a
person
never
turned
from
my
object
my
belief
is
that
you
have
no
lawful
authority
whatever
and
if
you
persist
in
your
present
course
i
must
take
very
unpleasant
means
to
ascertain
whether
you
have
or
have
not
what
means
may
those
be
asked
the
man
drily
the
sending
for
a
constable
answered
winkworth
and
giving
you
in
charge
for
assault
and
false
imprisonment
you
will
think
twice
before
you
do
that
i
fancy
no
i
shall
not
answered
winkworth
i
never
think
twice
of
anything
but
you
may
save
me
some
trouble
and
yourself
some
annoyance
by
answering
a
few
very
simple
questions
which
i
have
every
right
to
demand
well
i
have
no
objection
to
answer
any
reasonable
question
said
the
master
who
did
not
like
the
notion
of
being
given
in
charge
though
he
had
affected
to
treat
it
lightly
first
then
said
winkworth
has
the
lady
been
seen
by
any
physician
not
yet
replied
the
master
of
the
house
but
one
will
visit
her
in
an
hour
or
two
then
by
whose
authority
do
you
detain
her
in
the
mean
while
demanded
the
old
gentleman
after
an
instant
hesitation
the
reply
was
by
that
of
scriven
a
connection
of
the
lady
a
grim
smile
came
upon
winkworth
yellow
face
i
am
quite
as
near
a
connection
of
the
lady
as
scriven
sir
he
replied
and
i
now
demand
to
see
her
without
further
delay
if
you
accede
i
shall
take
no
further
steps
of
any
kind
till
she
has
been
visited
by
the
medical
man
of
whom
you
speak
and
until
he
has
given
a
certificate
as
to
her
state
if
you
refuse
i
must
take
those
measures
at
which
i
hinted
oh
very
well
replied
the
master
who
had
by
this
time
made
up
his
mind
if
you
promise
me
that
i
will
certainly
admit
you
winkworth
who
right
well
understood
the
whole
process
which
had
been
going
on
in
the
man
mind
merely
nodded
his
head
with
a
dry
smile
and
saying
to
the
boy
come
along
jim
he
followed
the
master
into
the
interior
of
the
building
it
was
not
a
very
large
establishment
nor
had
it
many
patients
in
it
but
the
whole
bore
more
or
less
an
aspect
of
neatness
and
cleanliness
although
the
part
which
they
first
passed
through
was
very
much
superior
in
furniture
and
decoration
to
that
at
which
they
afterwards
arrived
it
was
in
the
poorer
part
of
the
house
where
patients
paying
very
small
sums
were
confined
that
they
found
poor
miss
hayley
she
had
a
room
to
herself
but
the
master
while
unlocking
the
door
thought
fit
to
explain
that
they
had
not
yet
had
time
to
put
her
in
a
ward
winkworth
entered
the
room
first
and
the
poor
woman
who
was
seated
near
the
window
turned
a
timid
glance
upon
him
but
immediately
withdrew
her
eyes
not
appearing
to
recognise
him
the
old
gentleman
however
advanced
kindly
to
her
saying
do
you
remember
me
here
is
your
young
friend
jim
come
to
see
you
miss
hayley
suddenly
turned
round
at
the
name
and
the
moment
she
beheld
the
boy
started
up
ran
towards
him
and
cast
her
arms
round
his
neck
the
large
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
too
and
they
seemed
to
relieve
her
brain
for
the
wild
scared
look
with
which
she
had
at
first
regarded
winkworth
passed
away
oh
jim
she
said
i
thought
they
would
never
let
me
see
you
again
but
come
here
my
dear
come
here
i
want
to
speak
with
you
and
drawing
the
boy
into
the
farther
corner
of
the
room
she
whispered
to
him
eagerly
for
several
minutes
he
has
got
them
all
said
the
boy
at
length
pointing
to
winkworth
he
has
sealed
up
the
papers
without
reading
them
what
would
you
wish
done
with
them
asked
winkworth
anything
you
direct
i
will
see
performed
poor
miss
hayley
however
made
no
reply
giving
him
a
doubtful
glance
and
again
whispering
eagerly
to
the
boy
shall
i
tell
him
so
asked
jim
after
having
listened
attentively
for
a
minute
or
two
if
you
can
trust
him
replied
miss
hayley
gazing
at
winkworth
with
her
large
black
eyes
but
not
here
not
here
quite
quietly
where
nobody
can
hear
and
see
that
there
nobody
listening
at
the
door
for
he
a
very
cunning
man
that
scriven
and
a
hard
cruel
man
too
you
see
sir
she
quite
mad
said
the
master
of
the
house
addressing
winkworth
in
a
low
tone
you
can
have
no
doubt
of
that
i
suppose
i
have
no
doubt
that
her
reason
is
impaired
replied
the
old
gentleman
but
at
the
same
time
my
good
sir
i
have
many
doubts
as
to
whether
her
state
of
mind
justifies
or
requires
her
detention
in
a
place
of
this
kind
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
it
affords
no
excuse
for
excluding
her
friends
from
seeing
her
that
must
be
according
to
the
doctor
orders
replied
the
other
i
have
no
wish
to
prevent
people
from
seeing
her
only
scriven
thought
it
might
irritate
her
pooh
pooh
answered
winkworth
scriven
should
know
better
and
besides
he
has
no
authority
here
he
is
no
relation
no
connection
and
has
been
anything
but
a
friend
to
her
and
hers
that
she
shall
be
well
treated
and
comfortably
lodged
i
and
other
friends
of
her
family
will
insist
upon
and
i
authorise
you
to
let
her
have
more
fitting
accommodation
than
this
room
making
myself
responsible
for
any
reasonable
expense
that
such
an
alteration
may
entail
i
do
not
wish
to
interfere
beyond
a
certain
limit
and
as
long
as
i
find
that
her
friends
are
freely
admitted
to
her
and
that
she
is
well
and
kindly
treated
i
shall
be
satisfied
but
if
any
severe
restrictions
are
attempted
i
shall
immediately
apply
for
a
commission
to
inquire
into
her
state
i
have
not
the
honour
even
of
knowing
your
name
rejoined
the
master
of
the
house
and
of
course
must
be
responsible
to
those
who
placed
the
lady
here
if
you
will
come
and
furnish
me
with
pen
ink
and
paper
replied
winkworth
you
shall
have
my
address
and
the
directions
i
have
to
give
in
writing
so
that
there
can
be
no
mistake
and
that
you
may
be
ensured
against
loss
this
proposal
was
very
satisfactory
to
the
master
of
the
house
and
the
boy
jim
being
left
with
poor
miss
hayley
at
request
the
other
two
went
and
were
absent
for
a
little
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
they
returned
it
was
somewhat
difficult
to
induce
the
poor
old
lady
to
part
with
the
boy
she
held
his
hand
in
hers
and
asked
him
to
stay
with
her
so
piteously
that
winkworth
kind
heart
was
grieved
to
take
him
away
he
promised
to
send
her
some
books
and
she
petitioned
earnestly
for
paper
and
for
drawing
and
writing
materials
the
master
of
the
house
too
promised
to
let
her
play
for
an
hour
every
day
upon
the
organ
adding
you
used
to
be
very
fond
of
music
when
you
were
here
before
what
then
this
is
the
house
in
which
she
was
confined
at
first
said
winkworth
to
be
sure
sir
answered
the
man
she
got
out
in
the
most
cunning
way
possible
and
she
will
need
a
deal
of
watching
i
can
tell
you
to
prevent
her
doing
so
again
come
you
must
let
the
boy
go
and
drawing
jim
away
from
her
he
saw
him
and
winkworth
out
of
the
room
and
then
locked
the
door
come
into
the
carriage
with
me
my
lad
said
the
old
gentleman
as
the
boy
was
going
to
take
his
seat
behind
and
during
the
whole
way
back
to
his
hotel
winkworth
continued
in
very
earnest
conversation
with
his
young
companion
which
left
him
grave
and
thoughtful
for
the
rest
of
the
day
chapter
xxiii
henry
hayley
sat
beside
maria
monkton
alone
lady
anne
mellent
and
charles
marston
had
left
them
together
as
soon
as
they
found
that
lady
fleetwood
was
out
their
own
hearts
told
them
how
pleasant
are
the
few
uninterrupted
moments
of
happy
communion
which
love
can
snatch
from
the
giddy
and
importunate
world
charles
marston
had
promised
to
return
for
henry
in
an
hour
and
the
young
soldier
was
eager
to
take
advantage
of
precious
opportunity
to
say
a
part
at
least
of
all
that
remained
to
be
said
between
him
and
her
he
loved
maria
however
was
sad
or
at
least
very
grave
the
agitation
of
being
thus
left
alone
with
him
perhaps
might
have
some
share
in
that
seriousness
for
woman
love
only
grows
bold
by
degrees
perhaps
the
uncertainty
of
his
fate
and
future
prospects
might
have
some
share
for
how
full
of
emotions
is
the
anxiety
with
which
we
watch
the
current
of
events
affecting
a
beloved
object
events
over
which
we
have
no
control
or
power
especially
when
from
ignorance
or
inexperience
we
can
not
calculate
the
amount
of
dangers
that
menace
and
difficulties
that
beset
however
maria
was
very
grave
as
i
have
said
and
henry
remarking
it
hastened
to
make
an
effort
to
remove
what
he
imagined
might
be
the
cause
of
the
sadness
he
beheld
how
i
have
longed
for
this
moment
dear
maria
he
said
and
yet
now
it
is
come
i
fear
it
will
last
so
short
a
time
that
i
shall
not
have
space
to
say
all
i
have
to
say
indeed
dear
girl
it
becomes
more
and
more
necessary
every
moment
that
we
should
have
some
means
of
communicating
with
each
other
unrestrained
by
the
presence
of
others
how
may
this
be
maria
for
i
foresee
that
from
time
to
time
it
may
be
absolutely
needful
for
me
to
have
at
least
a
few
minutes
to
explain
to
you
things
that
may
appear
strange
in
my
conduct
to
show
you
that
there
is
no
cause
for
fear
even
when
things
seem
going
wrong
to
communicate
to
you
in
short
the
hopes
and
expectations
that
are
in
my
own
bosom
whenever
they
assume
a
tangible
form
you
must
tell
me
the
fears
and
the
dangers
too
henry
said
maria
you
can
not
tell
what
i
suffered
during
the
whole
of
while
such
sharp
questions
and
answers
were
passing
between
you
and
my
uncle
his
suspicions
are
evidently
aroused
as
to
how
i
can
see
you
except
at
such
moments
as
these
i
do
not
know
what
to
reply
if
it
be
needful
indeed
i
can
drive
down
into
the
country
for
a
day
at
any
time
and
see
you
there
but
as
we
are
all
going
soon
to
lady
anne
mellent
it
seems
there
will
be
plenty
of
opportunity
there
was
a
slight
peculiarity
in
her
way
of
pronouncing
lady
anne
mellent
name
an
emphatic
dwelling
upon
the
words
which
did
not
escape
henry
ear
and
he
gazed
at
maria
for
a
moment
with
a
look
almost
as
grave
as
her
own
then
laying
his
hand
lightly
upon
hers
he
said
do
you
not
think
lady
anne
manner
strange
towards
me
maria
do
you
not
think
mine
strange
towards
her
the
colour
came
warmly
into
maria
cheek
no
henry
she
said
after
a
moment
pause
i
might
think
both
strange
were
any
other
person
concerned
than
dear
anne
mellent
but
i
know
her
so
well
i
know
that
she
is
so
good
so
kind
so
true
so
sincere
and
yet
in
habit
of
thought
and
general
course
of
action
so
unlike
other
people
that
what
would
be
strange
with
others
is
not
strange
with
her
and
i
feel
sure
henry
that
there
is
some
strong
and
good
motive
both
with
you
and
her
for
all
you
do
still
henry
gazed
at
her
gravely
and
thoughtfully
there
is
something
more
maria
he
said
stay
dear
girl
let
me
place
the
case
before
you
as
strongly
as
it
can
be
placed
to
show
you
that
i
see
the
most
unfavourable
light
in
which
it
can
be
viewed
i
return
to
you
after
many
years
of
sad
and
painful
exile
with
a
reputation
tarnished
and
doubtful
with
a
story
vouched
for
by
my
own
word
alone
you
receive
me
as
if
not
a
day
had
passed
as
if
not
a
breath
had
sullied
my
name
you
believe
my
exculpation
you
listen
to
my
love
you
give
me
confidence
comfort
hope
and
yet
while
telling
you
that
i
love
you
you
alone
you
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
i
am
more
frequently
with
another
passing
long
hours
with
her
conferring
consulting
with
her
although
she
is
one
whom
good
kind
and
amiable
as
she
is
i
profess
to
regard
in
a
very
different
manner
less
warm
less
tender
than
that
in
which
i
regard
yourself
acknowledge
that
it
has
struck
you
as
very
strange
maria
that
it
has
pained
you
that
it
has
almost
made
you
doubt
me
no
no
indeed
henry
she
said
it
has
not
done
so
you
could
have
no
motive
no
object
in
deceiving
me
even
if
i
could
believe
you
capable
of
doing
so
henry
smiled
faintly
i
might
tell
you
he
said
that
there
are
many
causes
for
such
conduct
that
lady
anne
from
her
father
old
intimacy
with
mine
possesses
information
most
valuable
to
me
upon
the
only
points
where
difficulties
stand
in
my
way
or
dangers
menace
me
that
i
have
always
the
opportunity
of
seeing
her
alone
of
consulting
with
her
and
making
arrangements
to
secure
the
future
all
this
is
true
and
i
might
add
that
though
you
may
think
this
close
communication
dangerous
with
one
young
gay
beautiful
as
she
is
yet
there
is
no
risk
for
a
heart
given
entirely
to
you
which
has
never
loved
another
and
never
will
but
i
will
put
it
upon
a
totally
different
ground
i
will
only
say
trust
me
dear
maria
fully
entirely
as
you
did
when
there
was
every
cause
to
doubt
and
suspect
me
believe
that
i
am
incapable
of
any
baseness
especially
to
one
whose
generous
kindness
and
undoubting
confidence
have
been
the
brightest
reward
of
that
rectitude
of
which
i
am
conscious
and
the
sweetest
compensation
for
all
that
i
have
suffered
and
deserved
trust
me
and
do
not
doubt
me
and
in
a
very
few
days
all
shall
be
explained
indeed
henry
i
have
never
doubted
you
replied
maria
earnestly
never
upon
my
word
i
have
been
a
little
anxious
a
little
sad
and
my
feelings
have
been
so
mixed
that
they
would
be
difficult
to
explain
the
evident
suspicions
of
my
uncle
alarm
me
my
aunt
fleetwood
too
recognises
you
i
am
sure
you
can
easily
imagine
that
not
fully
knowing
what
is
taking
place
what
means
you
have
of
proving
your
innocence
what
your
intentions
are
what
your
course
is
to
be
i
have
felt
agitated
frightened
and
besides
she
paused
and
did
not
conclude
the
sentence
there
is
something
more
said
henry
say
what
besides
maria
maria
laughed
but
not
gaily
and
shook
the
bright
curls
back
from
her
face
with
some
degree
of
agitation
i
was
going
to
say
she
replied
that
besides
all
this
the
way
you
replied
several
times
to
my
uncle
last
night
troubled
and
alarmed
me
a
good
deal
there
was
a
mocking
sort
of
sarcasm
which
i
thought
likely
to
irritate
him
rather
than
otherwise
to
provoke
him
to
pursue
his
inquiries
farther
it
was
unlike
yourself
too
henry
you
were
always
frank
earnest
calm
even
in
your
very
gaiety
there
was
a
clear
open
candour
peculiar
to
yourself
last
night
there
might
be
playfulness
yet
there
was
a
degree
of
sneering
superciliousness
too
a
touch
of
scorn
for
the
opinion
of
others
a
little
like
lady
anne
own
manner
to
those
whom
she
despises
which
struck
me
very
much
i
love
henry
hayley
natural
manner
better
henry
laughed
gaily
and
pressed
his
lips
upon
her
hand
it
shall
all
come
back
again
dearest
maria
he
replied
in
a
very
very
short
time
but
in
the
mean
while
you
must
not
let
that
manner
pain
you
any
more
even
though
you
should
see
it
carried
still
farther
you
have
said
you
do
not
know
what
my
intentions
are
what
my
course
is
to
be
now
dearest
maria
listen
and
do
not
be
angry
with
me
even
if
you
think
my
course
is
a
rash
and
imprudent
one
my
intentions
are
very
strange
whenever
i
meet
your
uncle
i
propose
to
treat
him
exactly
as
i
did
last
night
to
irritate
him
if
you
will
to
goad
him
on
in
short
upon
the
course
in
which
his
suspicions
would
lead
him
to
drive
him
to
take
the
initiative
in
proving
who
i
am
and
to
throw
no
obstacles
in
his
way
except
such
as
may
stimulate
him
to
proceed
the
more
fiercely
in
this
course
i
even
intend
to
make
you
art
and
part
with
a
sort
of
bold
and
almost
impudent
recklessness
which
believe
me
i
should
never
dream
of
were
the
circumstances
different
i
know
not
whether
maria
will
forgive
me
nor
how
she
may
herself
be
disposed
to
act
but
wherever
i
meet
her
especially
where
scriven
is
present
my
feelings
towards
her
will
appear
undisguised
i
will
seek
her
as
an
object
of
deep
and
ardent
attachment
and
though
of
course
my
conduct
shall
be
regulated
by
the
ordinary
proprieties
of
life
so
as
not
to
pain
her
feelings
by
calling
the
gaze
of
the
multitude
upon
us
yet
no
one
shall
see
me
near
her
and
doubt
that
she
is
dearer
to
me
than
any
other
being
upon
earth
how
will
maria
act
with
so
strange
a
man
maria
smiled
gladly
for
though
there
was
much
that
she
did
not
comprehend
many
motives
that
she
did
not
see
objects
that
were
hidden
yet
through
the
mist
there
gleamed
things
pleasant
to
her
eyes
hopes
assurances
affections
that
seemed
bright
and
happy
he
could
not
so
act
he
could
not
so
speak
without
deep
love
without
strong
expectation
she
will
act
as
you
would
wish
her
henry
she
replied
a
promise
once
given
is
with
me
binding
for
ever
nor
will
i
shrink
from
avowing
it
no
nor
attempt
to
conceal
it
but
i
will
not
endeavour
henry
either
to
say
or
to
determine
how
i
will
act
i
will
let
my
conduct
towards
you
take
its
natural
course
the
feelings
in
my
heart
the
confidence
the
trust
will
ensure
that
it
shall
be
such
as
will
not
be
disagreeable
to
you
and
i
am
sure
that
whatever
you
think
it
right
to
do
will
be
so
guided
as
not
to
render
it
painful
to
me
except
in
regard
to
your
uncle
dear
maria
he
replied
perhaps
in
his
case
it
may
be
so
but
it
will
spare
much
hereafter
and
of
this
be
assured
that
no
consideration
whatever
would
induce
me
to
blazon
forth
my
attachment
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
did
i
not
feel
fully
assured
that
when
all
is
made
clear
and
every
cloud
blown
away
i
shall
stand
forth
not
unworthy
of
the
affection
of
such
a
heart
as
yours
not
unqualified
even
in
point
of
wealth
and
the
esteem
to
seek
your
hand
as
to
wealth
said
maria
smiling
that
need
be
no
consideration
henry
i
have
enough
and
more
than
enough
for
both
and
i
suppose
of
course
that
when
you
resume
your
real
name
and
station
you
will
resign
the
fortune
which
you
hold
as
frank
middleton
i
do
not
know
answered
henry
that
fortune
was
not
obtained
by
any
deceit
he
who
left
it
to
me
knew
right
well
that
i
was
not
frank
middleton
and
i
can
prove
that
such
was
the
case
however
that
will
be
a
matter
for
after
consideration
though
were
i
to
do
as
you
say
scriven
would
undoubtedly
exclaim
loudly
against
your
marrying
a
beggar
though
he
might
not
be
able
to
prove
that
you
were
marrying
a
felon
but
what
say
you
maria
he
continued
gaily
might
we
not
pursue
another
course
might
you
not
give
this
dear
little
hand
to
colonel
middleton
of
a
grandee
of
spain
might
you
not
go
with
him
to
that
bright
sunshiny
land
and
spend
the
rest
of
life
amidst
groves
of
oranges
and
myrtles
by
the
side
of
clear
streams
with
the
spreading
out
its
broad
rugged
branches
overhead
and
the
wild
blue
mountains
falling
into
every
fanciful
form
against
the
distant
sky
there
amidst
the
marble
palaces
of
races
long
passed
away
with
minaret
and
dome
and
fretted
arch
and
fountains
sparkling
in
the
sun
the
breeze
loaded
with
fragrance
and
the
night
sky
gemmed
with
lustrous
stars
life
might
fly
away
like
a
summer
dream
and
all
the
dark
realities
in
the
fate
of
henry
hayley
be
forgotten
you
are
mocking
me
even
now
henry
said
maria
shaking
her
head
do
not
put
such
a
question
to
me
again
unless
you
put
it
seriously
and
if
ever
you
should
do
so
i
will
take
two
minutes
to
consider
and
then
give
you
an
answer
but
hark
there
is
my
aunt
fleetwood
i
know
her
servant
knock
well
then
remember
dear
maria
said
henry
that
to
her
as
well
as
to
others
i
may
behave
strangely
nor
be
you
surprised
at
anything
you
may
see
nor
think
that
i
am
changed
except
in
mere
appearances
all
will
be
fully
explained
in
time
and
in
the
mean
while
dear
maria
trust
me
i
will
i
will
answered
maria
with
a
smile
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
lady
fleetwood
entered
the
room
she
seemed
somewhat
disconcerted
at
finding
colonel
middleton
there
and
she
would
fain
have
been
a
little
cool
and
distant
in
her
manner
but
it
was
a
very
difficult
thing
for
her
ladyship
to
feel
or
appear
cold
to
anybody
in
the
case
of
henry
it
would
have
been
less
easy
than
in
any
other
for
in
spite
of
all
she
could
do
there
was
a
natural
warming
of
the
heart
towards
him
whom
she
had
loved
and
caressed
as
a
boy
which
she
could
not
overcome
his
manner
too
was
very
engaging
and
he
spoke
to
her
so
like
an
old
friend
with
so
much
of
the
easy
confidence
of
affection
that
she
could
not
either
persuade
herself
he
was
other
than
henry
hayley
or
make
herself
angry
lest
his
evident
love
for
maria
should
spoil
her
favourite
scheme
of
uniting
her
niece
and
nephew
to
do
henry
merely
justice
he
did
not
in
the
least
attempt
to
conceal
from
lady
fleetwood
his
affection
for
maria
but
on
the
contrary
to
use
the
ordinary
term
made
love
to
her
more
openly
and
desperately
when
her
aunt
alone
was
present
to
watch
them
than
he
would
have
done
in
the
presence
of
any
other
human
being
poor
lady
fleetwood
witnessed
it
all
with
sad
dismay
she
had
fortified
herself
strongly
in
her
little
plan
for
charles
and
maria
and
the
great
indifference
which
her
niece
had
shown
for
all
other
men
the
rejection
of
two
or
three
very
eligible
proposals
and
the
light
and
laughing
way
in
which
she
usually
treated
the
subject
of
marriage
when
her
aunt
in
simplicity
of
heart
forced
it
upon
her
had
all
tended
to
strengthen
her
belief
in
the
security
of
her
position
now
however
she
saw
so
terrible
an
attack
made
upon
it
that
she
began
to
entertain
the
notion
that
she
could
not
maintain
it
and
maria
although
she
was
not
one
to
flirt
even
with
a
lover
suffered
every
now
and
then
a
word
a
look
a
smile
to
escape
her
which
made
poor
lady
fleetwood
tremble
for
the
fate
of
all
her
little
arrangements
shortly
after
her
return
some
visiters
came
in
and
they
were
succeeded
by
others
but
still
colonel
middleton
did
not
give
up
his
post
and
remained
there
with
his
manner
a
little
subdued
towards
maria
indeed
but
still
without
any
attempt
to
disguise
his
attentions
if
there
was
any
change
in
maria
manner
towards
him
it
became
rather
warmer
than
colder
in
the
presence
of
her
visiters
she
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
her
preference
and
poor
lady
fleetwood
was
more
uneasy
than
ever
when
she
found
moreover
that
henry
was
to
be
one
of
the
guests
at
lady
anne
mellent
she
was
actually
roused
to
an
attempt
to
carry
the
war
into
the
enemy
territory
though
poor
thing
heaven
knows
she
was
anything
but
fitted
for
an
enterprising
general
oh
then
you
are
going
down
to
lady
anne
colonel
middleton
she
said
with
a
meaning
smile
you
seem
very
intimate
there
have
you
been
long
acquainted
with
her
i
saw
lady
anne
at
a
ball
in
rome
more
than
a
year
ago
replied
henry
and
she
is
as
you
remark
exceedingly
kind
to
me
of
which
her
invitation
on
this
occasion
is
a
proof
for
as
soon
as
she
had
secured
you
and
miss
monkton
lady
fleetwood
she
sent
to
tell
me
so
and
to
invite
me
knowing
how
delighted
i
should
be
to
meet
you
there
and
how
desolate
london
would
seem
to
me
during
the
absence
of
yourself
and
your
fair
niece
the
slightest
possible
smile
curled
his
handsome
lip
as
he
spoke
and
maria
could
not
refrain
from
looking
a
little
amused
also
lady
fleetwood
felt
that
she
had
better
let
him
alone
and
in
a
few
minutes
after
to
her
great
relief
charles
marston
was
announced
he
had
not
entered
the
room
however
when
a
fluttering
apprehension
seized
upon
lady
fleetwood
lest
her
nephew
should
perceive
that
he
had
a
rival
in
the
young
officer
and
some
quarrel
should
be
the
result
she
therefore
determined
with
her
usual
kindness
to
try
and
explain
to
charles
that
colonel
middleton
was
only
there
accidentally
and
soften
matters
as
much
as
possible
but
charles
was
in
the
most
provoking
humour
in
the
world
and
seemed
resolved
to
demolish
all
his
aunt
hopes
and
expectations
completely
oh
my
dear
aunt
he
said
nearly
aloud
i
left
him
here
an
hour
ago
or
more
promising
to
call
for
him
again
lady
fleetwood
looked
aghast
and
murmured
on
purpose
oh
dear
yes
answered
charles
laughing
listen
and
i
tell
you
a
secret
in
your
ear
dear
lady
he
continued
in
a
whisper
see
if
i
am
not
the
kindest
and
most
considerate
man
in
the
world
i
found
that
you
were
out
and
that
maria
was
here
alone
so
i
went
away
and
left
middleton
with
her
thinking
they
might
have
something
to
say
to
each
other
so
now
that
a
hint
for
you
dearest
aunt
and
i
quite
sure
that
a
kind
creature
like
yourself
will
take
every
little
quiet
opportunity
of
letting
them
have
a
few
conversation
alone
from
time
to
time
poor
lady
fleetwood
was
struck
dumb
and
sinking
down
into
a
seat
she
began
to
play
with
the
stopper
of
a
large
which
stood
upon
the
table
in
the
mean
while
maria
and
henry
were
conversing
with
some
people
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
charles
and
his
friend
soon
after
took
their
departure
while
poor
lady
fleetwood
said
to
herself
well
i
suppose
there
is
no
use
in
trying
to
mend
the
matter
now
but
i
must
certainly
talk
to
my
brother
about
it
and
hear
what
he
thinks
i
never
could
have
believed
that
maria
would
throw
herself
away
upon
a
man
whom
she
has
only
known
a
few
days
and
half
a
spaniard
too
chapter
xxiv
when
i
was
a
boy
at
school
i
used
like
other
boys
to
employ
very
unprofitably
some
of
my
leisure
hours
in
keeping
in
a
neighbouring
garden
there
was
a
large
and
for
a
certain
sum
i
forget
what
i
as
well
as
other
boys
was
permitted
to
go
in
and
gather
as
many
leaves
as
i
thought
necessary
as
food
for
the
emblem
of
the
english
literary
man
i
mean
the
who
spins
golden
threads
for
the
benefit
of
others
and
whose
tomb
is
valued
after
he
himself
is
gone
but
it
is
not
with
the
i
have
to
do
now
the
leaves
which
i
gathered
as
a
boy
are
my
illustration
i
remember
very
well
that
i
used
to
place
them
one
upon
the
other
in
a
pile
and
try
to
gather
them
as
nearly
of
the
same
size
and
shape
as
i
could
but
do
what
i
would
i
never
was
able
to
find
two
that
were
exactly
alike
a
point
would
stick
out
here
and
a
point
would
stick
out
there
some
would
be
a
little
longer
some
would
be
a
little
shorter
and
i
used
to
marvel
even
in
those
young
days
that
in
such
a
simple
thing
as
a
leaf
there
should
be
such
infinite
variety
i
have
marvelled
more
at
human
nature
since
in
which
with
all
the
training
and
forcing
and
moulding
of
society
with
similar
education
similar
laws
i
might
almost
say
similar
accidents
we
never
find
two
characters
exactly
alike
any
more
than
two
leaves
perfectly
the
same
on
a
tree
were
this
a
contemplative
age
i
would
venture
to
meditate
upon
the
subject
much
farther
for
it
is
a
fine
one
and
a
strange
one
but
this
is
not
a
contemplative
age
it
is
an
age
of
action
wherein
no
thought
that
does
not
apply
to
the
mere
business
of
the
day
is
worth
a
farthing
i
do
not
mean
to
abuse
it
it
is
quite
as
good
as
any
other
age
that
ever
was
or
perhaps
ever
will
be
but
still
this
is
its
character
it
has
lost
something
if
it
has
gained
something
let
those
strike
the
balance
who
keep
such
accounts
accurately
i
am
of
the
age
so
i
must
onward
and
i
only
put
down
these
meditations
because
there
are
some
men
of
a
contemplative
turn
such
as
i
once
was
myself
and
because
even
men
of
the
most
earnest
activity
have
their
contemplative
moments
when
that
which
is
suggestive
interests
more
than
that
which
is
objective
it
is
difficult
to
find
words
to
express
the
infinite
and
although
it
may
seem
a
pleonasmatic
expression
i
must
say
that
all
the
varieties
of
human
character
have
infinite
varieties
within
themselves
however
the
easily
impressible
character
that
which
suffers
opinions
feelings
thoughts
purposes
actions
to
be
continually
altered
by
the
changing
circumstances
around
the
chameleon
character
if
i
may
so
call
it
is
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
to
itself
and
to
those
it
affects
of
any
that
i
know
it
goes
beyond
the
chameleon
indeed
the
reptile
only
reflects
the
colours
of
objects
near
retaining
its
own
form
and
nature
the
impressible
character
on
the
contrary
is
changed
in
every
line
as
well
as
in
every
hue
by
that
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
certain
attributes
it
certainly
does
retain
the
substance
is
the
same
but
the
colour
and
the
form
are
always
varying
in
the
substance
lie
the
permanence
and
the
identity
all
else
is
moulded
and
painted
by
circumstance
now
substantially
there
never
was
a
kinder
or
a
better
heart
in
the
world
than
that
of
lady
fleetwood
she
was
ever
anxious
for
the
happiness
of
those
around
her
she
was
too
anxious
in
fact
for
never
thinking
they
could
secure
it
for
themselves
she
was
always
seeking
to
do
it
for
them
in
her
own
way
in
this
too
she
differed
from
many
other
persons
that
the
foundation
of
her
activity
was
not
exactly
vanity
it
was
not
so
much
that
she
thought
she
knew
better
than
they
did
what
would
contribute
to
their
happiness
as
that
she
was
always
making
mistakes
as
to
what
their
real
wishes
were
as
soon
as
she
was
thoroughly
convinced
and
completely
comprehended
which
seldom
happened
what
her
friends
truly
desired
no
one
would
labour
more
zealously
to
accomplish
it
than
she
would
but
always
in
a
wrong
direction
be
it
remarked
thus
it
was
nearly
as
dangerous
to
let
her
know
one
wishes
as
to
conceal
them
this
may
seem
a
somewhat
singular
character
but
yet
i
believe
few
who
have
lived
long
have
not
met
with
some
specimens
modified
by
circumstances
probably
and
indeed
there
is
a
spice
of
this
same
disposition
in
more
people
than
we
know
there
may
be
in
ourselves
if
you
wish
to
prove
the
fact
give
a
commission
to
a
friend
he
would
do
anything
to
serve
you
but
he
never
executes
the
commission
as
he
received
it
when
henry
hayley
left
her
with
charles
marston
lady
fleetwood
who
had
fully
made
up
her
mind
that
her
niece
maria
ought
to
marry
her
nephew
charles
and
that
she
would
have
married
him
too
if
he
had
asked
her
which
was
the
case
was
very
much
disappointed
to
see
a
towering
impediment
rising
up
in
the
way
of
such
a
consummation
and
she
resolutely
and
at
once
determined
to
go
that
very
day
and
consult
with
her
brother
scriven
in
the
desperate
hope
of
still
bringing
it
about
she
remained
firm
in
her
purpose
till
the
visiters
who
were
in
the
room
took
their
leave
also
but
then
a
conversation
took
place
between
her
and
maria
which
changed
all
her
views
and
purposes
take
note
reader
that
each
word
is
considered
even
that
word
unfortunately
when
the
visiters
were
gone
lady
fleetwood
thought
she
might
as
well
say
something
to
maria
about
colonel
middleton
she
thought
she
should
at
least
learn
what
her
views
and
intentions
were
and
very
likely
her
own
advice
and
remonstrances
might
still
affect
decision
heaven
help
the
poor
lady
she
was
but
little
aware
that
maria
stronger
mind
and
more
energetic
character
had
guided
her
like
a
child
for
many
years
without
ever
seeming
to
do
so
indeed
but
gently
gaily
laughingly
she
had
some
little
difficulty
in
beginning
for
there
was
a
sort
of
vague
consciousness
of
weakness
about
her
which
occasionally
made
her
timid
in
her
activity
however
she
at
length
said
i
did
not
expect
to
find
colonel
middleton
here
this
morning
my
love
maria
who
knew
every
turn
of
her
aunt
mind
as
well
as
that
of
her
own
sandal
saw
what
was
coming
and
a
slight
glow
spread
over
her
face
deepening
the
colour
of
her
cheek
and
tinging
her
fair
brow
and
temples
why
not
my
dear
aunt
she
asked
knowing
that
it
would
never
do
to
show
any
timidity
why
if
he
was
here
for
an
hour
before
i
came
in
his
visit
must
have
been
an
early
one
replied
lady
fleetwood
maria
mused
for
a
single
moment
but
then
determined
upon
her
course
at
once
he
wished
to
see
me
my
dear
aunt
she
said
and
therefore
he
came
at
a
time
when
he
thought
i
should
be
at
home
lady
fleetwood
began
to
perceive
that
the
matter
was
rather
hopeless
and
shaking
her
head
with
a
deep
sigh
she
replied
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
my
love
i
had
hoped
there
she
stopped
and
looked
so
disconsolate
that
maria
in
her
own
kind
and
gentle
manner
crossed
the
room
sat
down
beside
her
and
laid
her
hand
kindly
upon
her
aunt
you
had
hoped
what
my
dear
aunt
she
said
and
then
added
with
a
gay
smile
that
i
should
marry
charles
why
i
certainly
did
hope
it
maria
answered
her
aunt
and
i
know
that
your
uncle
wished
it
also
your
wishes
my
dear
aunt
would
always
have
much
weight
with
me
replied
maria
but
i
am
afraid
my
uncle
upon
such
a
subject
as
this
especially
would
have
none
as
to
charles
and
myself
however
though
i
am
very
sorry
that
any
wish
of
yours
should
be
disappointed
you
will
i
am
sure
admit
that
i
never
gave
you
any
reason
to
believe
that
such
a
thing
as
a
marriage
between
him
and
me
could
take
place
indeed
quite
the
contrary
charles
and
i
are
utterly
unsuited
to
each
other
though
i
have
a
great
regard
for
him
and
he
the
same
for
me
but
even
were
such
not
the
case
my
dear
aunt
certainly
no
marriage
can
or
ought
to
take
place
where
neither
party
is
willing
and
charles
depend
upon
it
would
be
quite
as
unwilling
to
marry
me
as
i
should
be
to
marry
him
but
that
is
no
reason
my
dear
why
you
should
marry
this
colonel
middleton
whom
you
have
only
known
for
a
few
days
said
lady
fleetwood
almost
sharply
certainly
not
answered
maria
her
colour
a
little
heightened
nor
did
i
say
that
i
am
going
to
do
so
but
yet
i
may
see
a
great
number
of
good
reasons
for
doing
so
and
no
reason
against
it
in
any
impracticable
scheme
which
friends
however
kind
may
have
thought
fit
to
frame
for
me
and
charles
but
tell
me
my
dear
aunt
what
objections
have
you
to
urge
against
colonel
middleton
why
that
you
have
known
him
so
short
a
time
replied
lady
fleetwood
causing
a
faint
smile
to
flutter
about
maria
pretty
lips
and
then
he
is
half
a
foreigner
you
can
know
nothing
of
his
character
his
disposition
his
fortune
his
station
nor
indeed
of
anything
about
him
maria
leaned
her
head
thoughtfully
on
her
hand
and
mused
for
a
minute
or
two
without
reply
lady
fleetwood
thought
she
had
made
great
progress
that
her
resolution
was
shaken
and
that
by
a
word
or
two
more
she
might
triumph
indeed
maria
she
said
you
must
think
better
of
this
matter
and
not
give
this
young
man
such
encouragement
i
will
do
everything
i
can
to
dissuade
you
and
i
must
get
your
uncle
to
help
me
i
have
no
doubt
the
man
is
some
foreign
adventurer
who
thinks
to
raise
himself
from
adversity
by
marrying
an
english
heiress
fie
fie
my
dear
aunt
cried
maria
almost
indignantly
this
is
unlike
yourself
is
it
generous
is
it
kind
is
it
even
just
to
speak
thus
of
a
man
of
whose
character
and
situation
you
know
nothing
but
now
my
dear
aunt
i
will
tell
you
i
know
everything
about
him
his
family
his
fortune
his
character
his
station
he
is
no
needy
adventurer
but
a
distinguished
officer
with
ample
fortune
and
a
high
reputation
the
conde
de
fraga
told
me
so
last
night
and
if
he
has
met
with
adversities
in
life
and
sorrows
bitter
and
undeserved
it
shall
be
my
task
and
a
sweet
one
to
console
him
and
make
him
forget
them
lady
fleetwood
was
aghast
at
the
result
of
her
own
efforts
for
she
had
never
seen
maria
so
much
moved
before
and
she
felt
also
that
there
was
some
truth
in
the
reproachful
words
of
her
niece
well
my
dear
maria
she
said
in
a
timid
tone
i
did
not
know
that
you
had
so
completely
made
up
your
mind
or
i
should
not
have
said
what
i
did
as
to
colonel
middleton
character
of
course
as
you
say
i
can
know
nothing
i
only
spoke
from
what
your
uncle
said
for
he
seemed
to
think
very
ill
of
him
i
thought
so
replied
maria
i
was
quite
sure
my
dear
aunt
that
it
is
not
in
your
nature
to
injure
or
traduce
any
one
even
by
a
word
my
uncle
is
harsh
and
prejudiced
but
surely
you
will
not
listen
to
unfounded
suspicions
the
justice
of
which
he
can
not
bring
forward
a
proof
to
support
i
know
very
well
your
uncle
does
dislike
him
very
much
from
his
likeness
to
poor
henry
hayley
said
lady
fleetwood
for
that
very
reason
i
should
love
him
replied
maria
warmly
and
now
my
dear
aunt
she
said
taking
lady
fleetwood
hand
affectionately
do
not
pain
and
grieve
your
maria
by
throwing
any
needless
and
useless
obstacles
and
objections
in
my
way
be
assured
that
i
know
well
what
i
am
doing
and
shall
be
perfectly
prepared
to
justify
it
but
even
were
such
not
the
case
were
colonel
middleton
poor
as
you
have
supposed
you
would
not
i
am
sure
provided
he
can
prove
himself
as
he
assuredly
can
an
honourable
and
upright
man
endeavour
to
thwart
the
affection
of
two
people
who
love
each
other
deeply
and
devotedly
that
such
is
the
case
on
my
part
you
may
be
perfectly
sure
for
no
consideration
would
ever
make
me
give
my
hand
to
a
man
who
did
not
possess
my
whole
heart
you
yourself
my
dear
aunt
have
shown
that
you
can
feel
the
deepest
and
most
enduring
affection
and
you
ought
to
know
how
painful
it
is
to
hear
objections
suspicions
and
prejudices
urged
against
a
man
whom
one
loves
the
tears
came
into
lady
fleetwood
eyes
i
do
indeed
my
dear
maria
she
said
and
now
that
i
know
you
do
love
him
far
be
it
from
me
to
do
anything
to
mar
your
happiness
far
far
from
it
i
will
do
everything
i
can
on
earth
to
facilitate
your
views
but
still
it
is
very
strange
that
you
should
become
attached
to
him
so
soon
and
so
strongly
why
i
have
seen
many
a
man
paying
devoted
attention
to
you
for
months
without
being
able
to
obtain
anything
but
the
coldest
possible
return
and
in
the
end
a
decided
rejection
no
man
had
any
right
to
make
me
reject
him
replied
maria
for
i
have
always
taken
care
my
dear
aunt
to
give
no
encouragement
to
such
proposals
and
have
done
my
best
to
avoid
them
for
you
may
well
believe
that
nothing
could
be
more
painful
to
me
than
to
inflict
pain
upon
another
but
still
it
is
very
strange
that
you
should
become
attached
to
colonel
middleton
so
soon
answered
lady
fleetwood
returning
pertinaciously
to
her
point
maria
smiled
there
is
a
secret
my
dear
aunt
she
said
which
i
must
not
tell
you
or
any
one
yet
but
you
shall
be
one
of
the
very
first
to
know
it
and
when
you
do
it
will
explain
all
that
now
seems
strange
lady
fleetwood
meditated
saying
a
secret
well
my
dear
i
do
wish
to
pry
into
any
secrets
but
be
sure
that
i
will
do
whatever
i
can
to
help
you
and
warming
in
her
new
zeal
as
she
went
on
she
said
whenever
colonel
middleton
comes
again
i
shall
go
out
of
the
room
just
to
leave
you
alone
with
him
for
you
may
have
things
to
say
to
each
other
no
no
my
dear
aunt
pray
do
not
do
that
exclaimed
maria
only
let
matters
follow
their
course
quietly
and
easily
take
no
notice
of
the
feelings
between
colonel
middleton
and
myself
and
i
promise
you
that
if
i
have
anything
to
say
to
him
or
he
to
me
which
requires
to
be
said
in
private
i
shall
very
quietly
take
him
into
another
room
for
i
am
not
in
the
least
ashamed
of
my
choice
or
afraid
of
avowing
it
notwithstanding
this
admonition
excellent
lady
fleetwood
was
determined
to
be
of
service
to
maria
and
her
lover
now
that
she
was
fully
convinced
of
which
way
her
niece
happiness
really
lay
she
was
all
eagerness
to
promote
her
views
there
was
a
necessity
for
activity
in
some
direction
upon
her
and
had
she
but
possessed
the
rare
quality
of
discretion
she
might
indeed
have
helped
the
lovers
very
much
but
unfortunately
the
worthy
lady
first
consideration
was
how
she
might
be
active
immediately
without
waiting
for
opportunity
which
is
always
very
indiscreet
no
way
presented
itself
to
her
imagination
for
some
moments
and
while
maria
retired
to
her
room
to
dress
for
going
out
and
moreover
to
recover
from
a
greater
degree
of
agitation
than
she
had
suffered
to
appear
lady
fleetwood
went
on
considering
what
could
best
be
done
to
remove
all
difficulties
from
her
niece
way
as
mischief
would
have
it
the
only
thing
she
could
think
of
was
to
go
and
persuade
scriven
that
it
would
be
the
best
possible
thing
after
all
for
maria
to
marry
colonel
middleton
she
felt
not
the
slightest
doubt
in
the
world
that
she
should
be
quite
successful
for
although
she
had
enjoyed
plenty
of
opportunities
of
judging
of
her
brother
she
was
not
yet
convinced
of
the
indisputable
fact
that
scriven
could
never
be
persuaded
whether
it
was
that
his
brains
were
harder
than
other
men
or
that
he
never
formed
a
wrong
opinion
in
his
life
or
that
there
is
a
peculiar
organ
of
persuadability
which
he
did
not
possess
certain
it
is
that
he
was
never
known
to
yield
one
step
when
once
he
had
taken
up
his
ground
however
as
i
have
said
lady
fleetwood
felt
perfectly
confident
of
success
she
was
convinced
herself
and
she
thought
the
same
arguments
which
had
produced
that
effect
on
her
must
be
convincing
with
others
she
did
not
remember
indeed
that
she
was
not
unlikely
to
forget
of
them
nevertheless
she
thought
i
will
not
say
a
word
about
it
to
maria
it
will
be
a
pleasant
surprise
to
her
to
find
that
her
uncle
offers
no
opposition
i
will
just
wait
till
she
has
gone
out
and
then
drive
to
the
city
at
once
chapter
xxv
at
the
door
of
a
hotel
in
james
street
towards
that
hour
of
the
day
at
which
waiters
butlers
and
valets
have
the
least
to
do
stood
a
group
consisting
of
several
of
those
respectable
personages
with
their
hands
behind
their
backs
enjoying
the
air
of
the
fine
spring
day
and
making
impertinent
comments
upon
everybody
who
passed
amongst
the
rest
was
a
tall
thin
man
of
middle
age
who
had
originally
possessed
very
dark
hair
as
well
as
a
dark
complexion
but
whose
hair
and
whiskers
were
now
thickly
mottled
with
grey
his
face
was
good
and
intelligent
his
eyes
were
black
and
sparkling
his
features
aquiline
and
high
though
he
was
an
italian
his
face
had
not
at
all
the
italian
cast
and
and
gentlemanly
in
appearance
he
looked
more
like
an
old
french
nobleman
who
had
escaped
the
first
revolution
than
the
foreign
servant
of
an
english
gentleman
which
was
in
reality
his
condition
he
and
one
or
two
more
were
standing
on
the
top
step
of
the
flight
which
descended
from
the
door
of
the
hotel
to
the
street
when
a
small
sleek
man
dressed
as
a
respectable
tradesman
approached
and
spoke
to
one
of
the
younger
waiters
who
upon
the
lowest
step
was
making
signs
to
a
chambermaid
in
the
area
i
do
know
i
am
sure
there
his
gentleman
said
the
waiter
carlini
this
person
is
asking
for
your
master
is
he
at
home
no
replied
the
other
with
a
very
slight
foreign
accent
he
has
gone
out
can
you
tell
me
where
he
is
to
be
found
sir
asked
the
tradesman
in
a
deferential
tone
i
want
to
speak
with
him
on
important
business
he
has
gone
to
lady
fleetwood
in
square
said
the
italian
but
if
your
business
is
not
very
important
indeed
he
will
not
thank
you
for
going
there
after
him
and
he
turned
round
to
carry
on
his
conversation
with
the
others
near
why
the
colonel
is
always
going
to
lady
fleetwood
carlini
said
the
head
waiter
with
a
jocular
air
i
should
not
wonder
if
you
found
a
mistress
there
some
day
i
recollect
her
a
very
handsome
woman
in
sir
john
time
what
do
you
think
of
it
is
it
likely
to
be
perhaps
so
i
know
nothing
about
it
replied
carlini
for
i
never
inquire
into
my
master
affairs
oh
it
all
settled
i
can
tell
you
said
a
pert
puppy
who
formed
the
third
at
the
top
of
the
steps
i
heard
my
master
talking
about
it
with
young
count
fraga
this
very
morning
and
it
to
be
very
soon
too
the
gentleman
who
had
been
speaking
to
the
waiter
below
heard
all
this
conversation
and
then
turned
away
it
might
seem
a
matter
of
little
importance
to
a
man
of
his
apparent
pursuits
in
life
who
married
another
in
the
higher
ranks
of
society
but
yet
he
seemed
very
well
satisfied
with
what
he
had
heard
and
he
chuckled
a
little
as
he
walked
up
james
street
crossed
over
to
the
corner
of
abermarle
street
and
then
took
his
way
towards
berkeley
square
it
only
wants
working
well
he
murmured
to
himself
it
only
wants
working
well
and
we
may
make
a
pretty
penny
of
it
i
must
trust
it
to
that
fool
sam
though
he
make
a
mess
of
it
going
to
be
married
in
two
days
well
that
extraordinary
i
dare
say
the
old
lady
would
like
to
be
disappointed
and
would
pay
a
handsome
sum
down
to
save
her
lover
from
being
scragged
but
i
must
let
sam
have
anything
to
do
with
it
he
so
rude
and
unpolishable
there
he
stands
i
must
have
a
chat
with
him
before
the
matter
goes
farther
and
walking
on
he
found
a
tall
stout
man
who
has
been
already
described
as
holding
negotiations
with
joshua
brown
the
pedlar
of
rather
a
fierce
and
intemperate
character
he
was
not
badly
dressed
upon
the
present
occasion
having
clearly
put
on
his
sunday
best
for
his
trip
to
london
but
nevertheless
he
could
not
by
any
means
get
rid
of
a
certain
blackguard
air
any
more
than
the
ominous
black
eye
which
shed
a
halo
of
many
colours
around
it
on
the
cheek
and
temple
as
soon
as
he
saw
his
friend
and
mingy
bowes
he
advanced
towards
him
with
a
quick
step
asking
eagerly
for
intelligence
in
language
which
perhaps
would
not
be
altogether
comprehensible
to
most
of
my
readers
mum
said
mingy
bowes
holding
up
his
finger
and
looking
along
the
pavement
under
the
walls
of
lansdowne
house
where
a
policeman
was
seen
sauntering
slowly
and
along
his
eyes
turned
towards
the
wall
as
if
his
sole
business
in
life
was
to
count
bricks
set
in
mortar
come
along
sam
let
us
go
and
have
a
whet
at
the
and
whistle
the
cove
out
but
i
got
hold
of
something
that
if
tidily
worked
may
fill
both
our
breeches
pockets
i
have
mine
filled
first
said
the
man
he
called
sam
for
my
job
anyhow
mingy
though
i
do
mind
your
having
a
cut
out
of
the
whiddy
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
answered
mingy
bowes
that
all
fair
i
do
want
more
than
a
quarter
and
i
manage
it
so
if
you
let
me
that
i
answer
for
it
my
quarter
shall
be
more
than
ever
i
took
in
three
months
out
of
the
shop
the
bank
into
the
bargain
his
companion
merely
gave
a
grunt
for
the
policeman
was
by
this
time
near
and
they
walked
on
together
across
various
streets
and
through
various
alleys
which
led
into
oxford
street
it
is
curious
and
sad
that
in
some
of
the
most
fashionable
parts
of
the
town
of
london
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
mansions
of
the
opulent
and
great
are
or
at
least
were
some
twenty
years
ago
an
immense
mass
of
the
lowest
and
most
squalid
houses
in
the
metropolis
close
by
grosvenor
and
manchester
squares
and
lying
between
them
and
bond
street
are
a
number
of
places
in
which
it
was
dangerous
as
the
writer
once
found
to
his
cost
for
a
person
to
set
his
foot
there
congregated
tier
above
tier
in
small
dark
unwholesome
rooms
are
whole
classes
of
people
in
comparison
with
whom
the
denizens
of
saint
giles
may
be
looked
upon
as
aristocracy
if
you
walk
along
one
of
these
courts
or
alleys
the
first
things
you
remark
on
the
right
hand
and
the
left
are
the
two
confederates
in
demoralization
and
degradation
the
pawnbroker
and
the
both
tolerated
and
encouraged
by
the
british
government
on
account
of
those
iniquitous
and
burdensome
taxes
grouped
under
the
name
of
excise
taxes
which
whatever
they
may
do
for
the
revenue
tend
more
to
hamper
industry
to
debase
the
people
to
make
rogues
of
honest
men
to
prevent
the
employment
of
the
poor
to
give
monopoly
to
the
rich
to
obstruct
salutary
laws
and
to
disgrace
the
legislature
than
any
imposts
that
ever
were
invented
by
the
great
british
demon
taxation
the
fact
is
ministers
dare
not
deal
with
the
nuisance
as
they
would
with
any
other
nuisance
for
fear
of
diminishing
the
revenue
and
when
they
come
before
parliament
and
boast
of
an
increased
revenue
from
the
excise
which
they
call
the
barometer
of
commercial
prosperity
they
boast
in
fact
of
how
much
they
have
been
able
to
wring
from
the
vices
the
follies
or
the
hard
labours
of
the
industrious
classes
they
say
neither
more
nor
less
than
this
there
must
have
been
more
demand
for
labour
because
the
labouring
classes
have
been
able
to
drink
more
gin
to
smoke
more
tobacco
and
to
swill
more
beer
this
is
a
very
irrelevant
tirade
but
it
would
be
written
beyond
the
pawnbroker
and
the
you
enter
into
the
heart
of
the
den
probably
meeting
at
the
first
two
or
three
steps
some
women
with
foul
matted
hair
caps
which
were
once
white
and
yellowish
handkerchiefs
loosely
spread
over
the
otherwise
uncovered
bosom
perhaps
there
is
a
short
pipe
in
the
mouth
but
there
is
gin
in
every
hue
of
the
face
and
the
eyes
are
bleared
and
inflamed
with
habitual
intoxication
there
may
be
a
miserable
baby
in
the
arms
or
on
the
back
the
naked
feet
and
legs
appearing
from
beneath
the
rags
that
cover
it
sallow
sickly
the
nursling
of
misery
despair
and
vice
the
destined
victim
of
every
evil
passion
and
every
degrading
crime
above
below
around
from
every
window
in
cellar
in
attic
in
the
middle
floors
come
forth
the
varied
murmurs
in
different
tongues
and
tones
the
slang
and
cant
of
english
rogues
and
vagabonds
the
brogue
of
ireland
or
the
old
irish
language
itself
the
shouts
of
wrath
or
merriment
the
groans
of
anguish
the
cries
of
pain
or
sorrow
the
gay
laugh
the
dull
buzz
of
tongues
consulting
over
deeds
of
evil
telling
tales
of
despair
and
woe
or
asking
counsel
how
to
avoid
starvation
as
you
go
on
innumerable
are
the
different
forms
you
meet
in
every
shape
of
degradation
the
fierce
bludgeoned
bully
the
dexterous
pickpocket
the
wretched
woman
who
acts
as
their
decoy
the
boys
and
girls
serving
an
apprenticeship
to
vice
the
hoary
prompters
of
all
evil
who
in
the
shape
of
receivers
profit
by
the
crimes
of
the
younger
and
more
active
look
at
that
girl
there
in
the
tattered
chintz
gown
she
can
scarcely
be
sixteen
and
yet
see
how
she
reels
from
side
to
side
in
beastly
intoxication
and
then
that
elderly
man
in
the
shabby
brown
coat
with
the
venerable
white
hair
who
goes
walking
along
by
the
side
of
the
gutter
and
every
now
and
then
stops
and
gazes
in
as
if
he
saw
something
exceedingly
curious
there
he
is
a
man
with
a
gentlemanly
air
and
carriage
a
thief
and
a
man
suspected
of
murder
are
just
passing
him
but
he
is
quite
safe
they
know
he
has
nothing
to
lose
and
his
emaciated
body
would
not
fetch
two
pounds
at
the
anatomist
what
is
it
has
brought
him
to
this
state
look
in
his
face
see
the
dull
meaningless
eye
the
nose
and
lips
bloated
with
habitual
sottish
tippling
that
man
can
boast
that
he
never
was
drunk
in
his
life
but
for
more
than
forty
years
he
has
never
been
quite
sober
hark
to
the
screams
coming
forth
from
that
house
where
of
the
windowpanes
at
least
are
covered
up
with
paper
they
are
produced
by
a
drunken
scoundrel
beating
his
unhappy
wife
she
was
once
an
honest
cheerful
happy
country
girl
and
now
i
must
not
stay
to
tell
the
various
stages
of
degradation
she
has
gone
through
till
she
is
here
the
wife
of
a
drunken
savage
in
one
of
the
lowest
and
vilest
dens
of
london
hark
how
the
poor
thing
screams
under
the
ruffian
blow
while
one
of
his
brutal
companions
sits
hard
by
and
witnesses
it
laughing
three
days
hence
by
one
blow
that
man
will
murder
the
wretched
woman
in
the
presence
of
her
two
children
and
then
will
go
to
end
his
own
days
on
a
scaffold
leaving
those
wretched
infants
to
follow
the
same
course
in
after
years
i
must
not
pause
upon
these
things
more
it
was
through
such
scenes
as
i
have
described
that
mingy
bowes
and
his
companion
took
their
way
without
the
slightest
fear
or
trepidation
for
it
would
seem
that
they
both
knew
the
haunt
right
well
they
went
up
a
very
narrow
sort
of
court
out
of
oxford
road
and
then
turned
into
a
broader
and
more
street
though
heaven
knows
it
was
bad
enough
about
down
was
an
open
door
over
which
were
written
some
letters
required
by
the
excise
and
by
the
side
of
which
on
a
board
about
two
feet
square
appeared
a
curious
painting
on
a
background
intended
to
represent
sky
and
cloud
though
in
reality
it
looked
more
like
a
torn
blue
coat
with
a
white
shirt
peeping
through
the
rents
appeared
a
tolerably
well
painted
sow
standing
on
her
hind
legs
with
a
flageolet
in
her
mouth
whence
this
pleasant
resort
of
rogues
and
vagabonds
took
its
name
of
the
pig
and
whistle
mingy
and
his
friend
went
in
pushed
the
first
open
then
passed
a
second
for
there
was
no
impediment
in
the
way
at
least
for
the
moment
though
there
were
bolts
and
bars
in
plenty
about
which
might
possibly
be
used
at
times
to
shut
out
suspicious
characters
the
sense
of
words
of
course
differs
in
different
places
and
perhaps
by
the
term
suspicious
characters
two
very
different
classes
of
persons
would
be
meant
by
the
police
and
by
the
landlord
of
the
pig
and
whistle
the
latter
at
all
events
did
not
seem
to
consider
mingy
bowes
and
his
friend
sam
as
within
the
category
for
he
made
them
a
very
reverent
bow
as
they
entered
that
apartment
which
bore
an
ironical
inscription
designating
it
as
the
commercial
room
with
sam
he
seemed
quite
familiar
and
to
mingy
bowes
was
highly
deferential
for
gentlemen
of
mingy
calling
are
very
important
personages
in
the
great
community
of
thieves
and
scoundrels
as
soon
as
he
had
brought
the
liquor
which
his
two
guests
demanded
the
landlord
well
skilled
in
the
usages
of
his
own
peculiar
world
retired
from
the
room
which
for
the
time
had
no
other
tenants
than
those
just
arrived
and
so
the
cove
was
out
mingy
said
sam
who
had
by
this
time
recovered
in
some
degree
from
his
first
disappointment
but
this
you
found
out
that
you
think
you
may
work
well
mingy
took
a
sip
of
his
looked
into
his
glass
and
seemed
to
consider
like
one
of
homer
heroes
before
he
began
to
tell
his
story
when
it
began
however
it
was
not
a
very
long
one
why
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
sam
he
replied
at
length
the
young
man
is
to
be
married
to
a
rich
lady
a
good
deal
older
than
hisself
d
n
him
what
that
to
me
asked
the
ruffian
a
great
deal
answered
mingy
bowes
for
i
think
it
was
ten
to
one
your
scheme
broke
down
with
the
young
man
while
i
am
quite
sure
we
can
make
it
answer
with
the
old
woman
broke
down
how
the
devil
should
it
break
down
asked
sam
with
great
indignation
why
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
tell
him
that
blow
him
altogether
if
he
did
give
three
or
four
hundred
down
but
he
might
think
you
could
sam
said
mingy
bowes
in
a
sly
tone
you
may
say
you
would
soon
have
shown
him
that
you
could
and
that
you
tell
him
his
own
real
name
and
all
that
you
made
out
from
the
but
then
you
see
sam
it
very
much
more
than
probable
that
the
fellow
who
came
after
the
book
has
told
him
by
this
time
that
you
put
it
in
the
fire
then
the
young
man
will
lay
his
calculation
this
way
this
cove
has
burned
the
book
he
prove
anything
but
by
his
own
word
now
he
ca
come
forward
to
swear
even
if
his
swearing
would
be
of
any
good
for
if
he
swears
at
all
he
must
swear
that
he
knocked
me
down
and
took
my
and
then
what
his
oath
worth
if
i
give
him
a
penny
he
will
be
sure
to
come
bothering
me
for
more
that
what
he
will
say
sam
and
devilish
right
too
not
quite
so
right
after
all
answered
the
man
for
if
i
prove
nothing
myself
i
can
put
those
upon
the
scent
as
will
he
would
like
that
mingy
and
i
shall
just
tell
him
so
if
anybody
can
prove
that
he
the
same
man
who
ten
years
ago
was
called
henry
hayley
they
can
hang
him
that
all
for
the
paper
that
showed
who
did
forge
the
gentleman
name
was
burned
in
that
book
now
take
my
word
for
it
mingy
he
wo
let
it
come
to
that
for
the
sake
of
a
cool
hundred
or
two
do
you
recollect
whose
name
it
was
that
was
forged
asked
mingy
bowes
fixing
his
shrewd
eyes
upon
the
big
man
face
to
be
sure
i
do
answered
the
other
it
was
scriven
and
and
hang
me
if
the
young
fellow
makes
any
mouths
at
it
i
find
out
where
scriven
and
put
up
and
tell
them
all
about
it
for
heaven
sake
do
do
that
cried
mingy
bowes
with
a
look
of
consternation
it
was
bad
enough
burning
the
but
if
once
you
tell
you
given
the
whip
out
of
your
own
hands
altogether
my
man
let
me
try
it
with
the
old
lady
first
i
think
we
might
manage
to
get
a
thousand
pound
out
of
her
to
save
her
young
man
if
we
can
but
get
her
to
believe
that
we
can
grab
him
when
we
like
if
you
like
to
leave
her
to
me
sam
i
take
you
a
bet
i
screw
something
out
of
her
the
ruffian
seemed
a
good
deal
impressed
by
the
cogency
of
arguments
especially
in
regard
to
the
impropriety
of
suffering
his
valuable
secret
to
slip
from
him
in
any
fit
of
rage
no
no
it
wo
do
he
said
i
can
see
that
clear
enough
to
go
and
tell
scriven
and
till
i
tried
everything
else
and
as
to
the
old
lady
mingy
i
do
care
if
you
try
her
but
i
try
the
young
man
too
and
i
say
mingy
remember
fair
play
a
jewel
and
it
understood
i
am
to
have
of
whatever
we
get
and
you
one
quarter
so
no
kicking
master
mingy
honour
honour
said
mingy
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
but
now
let
have
something
to
eat
after
this
i
dare
say
the
landlord
has
got
some
cold
roast
pork
he
generally
has
his
pleasant
anticipations
were
fulfilled
the
landlord
had
cold
roast
pork
and
it
was
speedily
placed
upon
the
table
before
him
and
his
companion
together
with
a
fresh
supply
of
mingy
calculated
upon
discussing
all
points
which
wanted
further
elucidation
over
cold
pork
and
mustard
but
here
he
was
disappointed
for
hardly
had
each
helped
himself
abundantly
when
the
room
was
flooded
by
a
stream
of
the
usual
guests
who
seemed
just
returned
from
some
successful
enterprise
so
that
any
further
private
conversation
was
at
an
end
all
sorts
of
things
were
called
for
by
the
mingy
and
san
were
saluted
by
several
who
had
some
slight
acquaintance
with
them
beer
gin
brandy
flowed
abundantly
some
stood
some
sat
all
talked
together
there
was
a
great
deal
of
swearing
a
great
deal
of
laughter
a
great
deal
of
abuse
of
them
seemed
to
be
quarrelling
with
the
other
half
though
in
reality
they
were
only
what
is
called
chaffing
but
from
one
especial
corner
of
the
room
a
continual
strain
of
angry
words
was
heard
to
rise
which
went
on
with
greater
and
greater
vehemence
till
at
last
a
blow
was
struck
and
returned
two
or
three
who
were
near
rushed
forward
perhaps
to
see
what
was
going
on
perhaps
to
keep
the
peace
but
somehow
the
pugnacious
spirit
seemed
to
spread
fists
seemed
to
be
flying
about
very
thick
and
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
and
confusion
the
cause
of
which
nobody
appeared
clearly
to
understand
the
two
men
with
whom
the
riot
had
originated
came
struggling
forward
out
of
their
corner
driving
back
the
crowd
knocking
over
the
tables
and
benches
smashing
the
glasses
and
squeezing
flat
the
pewter
ware
mingy
bowes
did
not
like
the
scene
at
all
although
he
was
often
compelled
to
witness
such
for
besides
being
small
and
fragile
he
was
a
very
peaceable
person
and
thought
force
of
cunning
much
superior
to
force
of
arm
besides
he
calculated
upon
having
his
character
compromised
and
he
soon
saw
that
such
was
very
likely
to
be
the
case
his
more
pugnacious
companion
sam
who
never
could
resist
a
row
when
it
was
either
within
sight
or
hearing
had
just
started
up
and
rushed
into
the
midst
of
the
affray
exclaiming
i
soon
settle
that
when
mingy
bowes
having
raised
his
eyes
to
the
window
in
the
vain
hope
of
finding
some
means
of
exit
perceived
two
or
three
heads
gazing
in
and
at
the
same
time
heard
the
sound
of
a
rattle
he
would
have
given
worlds
to
reach
the
door
but
that
was
impossible
for
the
combatants
were
exactly
in
the
way
and
in
a
minute
after
his
worst
anticipations
were
realised
for
just
as
the
landlord
was
attempting
to
restore
peace
an
overwhelming
force
of
police
poured
in
and
the
whole
body
of
vagabonds
there
assembled
inclusive
of
sam
and
his
friend
were
marched
off
to
the
chapter
xxvi
there
was
a
fatality
about
lady
fleetwood
views
and
wishes
we
see
the
same
often
and
foolish
people
imagine
that
there
is
something
in
the
character
of
the
individual
which
so
assuredly
makes
the
schemes
of
certain
persons
fail
of
effect
it
is
all
a
mistake
no
man
has
a
mind
sufficiently
capacious
no
man
has
power
sufficiently
extensive
let
his
wit
wisdom
judgment
command
be
as
elevated
and
as
infinite
as
they
may
to
grasp
and
rule
the
circumstances
which
surround
even
the
smallest
of
his
plans
the
most
insignificant
of
his
actions
and
say
this
shall
succeed
he
can
not
say
with
certainty
i
will
walk
out
of
that
open
door
he
may
design
according
to
the
probabilities
which
are
apparent
to
him
he
may
exercise
a
keen
judgment
he
may
bring
long
experience
to
bear
upon
the
subject
he
may
calculate
by
all
that
the
keenest
and
the
justest
observation
has
taught
him
and
he
may
combine
by
the
powers
of
a
and
reason
but
when
he
has
done
this
he
has
done
all
the
rest
belongs
to
fate
which
in
other
words
is
the
will
of
god
the
man
who
has
well
and
thoughtfully
watched
the
progress
of
events
must
know
that
there
is
not
a
straw
so
small
that
it
may
not
throw
down
a
giant
in
his
course
and
if
napoleon
bonaparte
the
pampered
child
of
undeserved
success
did
really
say
which
i
do
not
believe
i
propose
and
i
dispose
too
he
had
used
to
very
little
purpose
the
experience
of
a
life
still
it
must
be
admitted
that
lady
fleetwood
plans
were
not
always
the
best
calculated
she
took
too
much
for
granted
she
had
an
enormous
number
of
very
frail
ladders
with
which
she
proposed
to
scale
the
high
walls
that
opposed
her
and
which
always
broke
down
at
the
very
first
step
she
set
upon
them
in
the
present
instance
however
she
was
disappointed
not
at
all
by
her
own
fault
she
set
out
to
see
scriven
at
an
hour
when
perhaps
during
the
last
six
or
years
he
would
not
have
been
found
absent
from
his
on
any
three
lawful
days
nevertheless
scriven
was
not
there
when
she
arrived
in
the
city
the
head
clerk
knew
not
where
he
had
gone
nor
when
he
would
return
so
there
was
no
sending
for
him
no
waiting
for
him
and
all
that
lady
fleetwood
could
do
was
to
leave
word
that
she
very
much
wished
to
see
him
if
he
could
call
upon
her
during
the
following
morning
the
head
clerk
promised
to
give
him
the
message
faithfully
and
lady
fleetwood
went
out
the
next
moment
however
she
returned
again
to
say
that
she
should
be
glad
if
he
could
call
about
eleven
then
she
returned
again
to
add
that
she
would
thank
him
to
send
for
her
down
into
the
library
and
a
third
time
she
returned
to
beg
that
he
would
not
say
to
any
one
she
had
called
to
ask
for
him
the
head
clerk
knew
lady
fleetwood
well
and
very
readily
promised
to
deliver
all
her
messages
but
they
did
not
get
very
accurately
to
scriven
ears
notwithstanding
and
on
the
following
day
the
excellent
lady
having
got
her
niece
maria
to
go
out
earlier
than
usual
and
given
her
servants
due
directions
sat
in
the
library
ready
to
receive
her
brother
in
vain
eleven
a
quarter
past
eleven
went
by
and
lady
fleetwood
who
was
as
impatient
as
a
girl
of
eighteen
tripped
lightly
up
to
her
own
room
proposing
to
go
out
and
call
upon
her
brother
as
he
had
not
attended
to
her
summons
the
distance
was
not
great
she
knew
the
exact
way
he
would
come
she
should
either
meet
him
as
he
came
or
catch
him
before
he
went
into
the
city
poor
lady
fleetwood
she
was
rarely
if
ever
destined
to
do
what
she
intended
to
do
the
servant
opened
the
door
for
his
mistress
to
pass
out
with
his
hat
and
long
cane
as
was
customary
in
those
days
ready
to
follow
but
lo
and
behold
upon
the
step
of
the
door
with
hand
ready
stretched
out
to
seize
the
knocker
appeared
a
little
man
with
a
shrewd
intelligent
countenance
lady
fleetwood
set
him
down
at
once
for
some
tradesman
or
some
shopman
and
being
as
i
have
shown
very
careful
and
economical
she
paused
to
make
inquiries
saying
what
do
you
want
my
good
man
i
wanted
to
speak
a
few
words
with
lady
fleetwood
said
mingy
bowes
for
he
it
was
delivered
from
incarceration
my
name
is
lady
fleetwood
replied
the
lady
while
mingy
took
off
his
hat
very
reverently
but
you
see
i
am
going
out
just
now
and
therefore
it
a
matter
of
great
importance
said
the
man
interrupting
her
it
would
be
much
better
for
you
to
hear
what
i
got
to
say
at
once
well
what
is
it
asked
the
old
lady
somewhat
impatiently
i
ca
tell
you
here
replied
the
other
you
not
like
it
if
i
did
if
i
could
say
a
word
to
you
alone
it
would
be
much
better
this
is
very
strange
said
lady
fleetwood
beginning
to
feel
some
degree
of
alarm
though
curiosity
predominated
most
decidedly
she
looked
over
the
person
of
mingy
bowes
with
an
inquiring
glance
but
there
was
nothing
very
formidable
in
the
little
man
appearance
when
dressed
in
his
best
as
on
the
present
occasion
he
was
decidedly
dapper
now
nothing
that
is
at
all
dapper
can
ever
be
awful
and
therefore
having
considered
him
well
for
a
minute
lady
fleetwood
repeated
it
is
very
strange
however
come
in
here
with
me
john
stand
you
near
the
door
and
if
my
brother
comes
show
him
but
you
go
away
from
the
door
yourself
for
for
i
do
not
know
what
this
person
wants
thus
saying
she
walked
into
the
and
mingy
bowes
followed
with
perfectly
composure
he
shut
the
door
carefully
behind
him
while
lady
fleetwood
seated
herself
in
an
armchair
and
pointing
to
another
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
in
order
to
keep
the
table
between
her
and
her
visiter
begged
him
to
be
seated
the
worthy
gentleman
accordingly
sat
down
brought
the
inside
of
his
hat
over
his
knees
and
bending
forward
so
as
to
get
his
head
as
far
across
the
table
as
possible
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
think
my
lady
you
acquainted
with
a
colonel
middleton
you
my
lady
yes
sir
said
lady
fleetwood
with
a
look
of
surprise
i
the
pleasure
of
knowing
him
very
well
i
think
my
lady
rejoined
bowes
putting
on
a
cunning
and
amiable
look
there
like
to
be
a
nearer
connection
is
there
my
lady
lady
fleetwood
face
flushed
with
surprise
and
dismay
to
find
the
secret
of
maria
engagement
to
colonel
middleton
already
known
to
such
a
person
as
the
man
before
her
good
gracious
she
exclaimed
who
told
you
that
did
colonel
middleton
himself
oh
dear
no
my
lady
replied
mingy
bowes
i
never
saw
colonel
middleton
in
all
my
life
that
i
know
of
then
in
the
name
of
heaven
what
do
you
want
demanded
lady
fleetwood
why
just
a
little
bit
of
business
answered
the
dealer
in
marine
stores
but
before
i
go
on
i
should
like
very
much
to
hear
whether
what
i
have
been
told
by
those
who
ought
to
know
about
there
being
such
a
connection
on
the
carpet
as
i
may
say
is
true
or
not
thus
pressed
lady
fleetwood
replied
after
a
good
deal
of
hesitation
why
i
believe
it
is
to
which
assertion
she
added
a
strongly
confirmatory
nod
of
the
head
very
well
my
lady
continued
bowes
as
soon
as
he
was
satisfied
on
this
point
then
the
thing
comes
to
this
you
see
that
gentleman
that
colonel
middleton
he
quite
a
gentleman
i
believe
and
i
do
mean
to
say
anything
against
it
but
there
a
bit
of
a
secret
about
him
and
that
a
secret
which
might
put
him
in
very
great
danger
if
it
were
to
be
known
to
every
one
ay
that
it
might
he
continued
seeing
the
consternation
on
lady
fleetwood
face
growing
deeper
and
deeper
every
moment
why
it
might
cost
him
his
life
and
no
mistake
really
this
is
very
terrible
exclaimed
the
poor
old
lady
not
knowing
what
to
say
or
what
to
do
why
it
is
indeed
replied
mingy
bowes
but
i
dare
say
it
can
be
managed
very
easily
for
a
small
sum
i
really
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
sir
said
the
worthy
lady
her
thoughts
getting
more
and
more
into
confusion
every
moment
why
now
i
explain
it
all
to
you
in
a
minute
replied
bowes
in
a
tone
of
kind
familiarity
you
see
the
case
is
this
this
gentleman
this
colonel
middleton
happened
by
chance
the
other
night
to
lose
his
how
he
lost
it
is
neither
here
nor
there
but
a
friend
of
mine
a
very
respectable
young
man
found
it
and
looking
in
to
see
whose
it
could
be
he
found
a
whole
heap
of
letters
and
papers
and
things
which
showed
him
the
whole
story
about
this
colonel
middleton
and
how
though
he
a
very
nice
young
man
and
all
that
his
life
in
danger
in
this
here
country
on
account
of
something
that
happened
ten
years
ago
lady
fleetwood
sat
confounded
for
her
mind
and
her
imagination
had
made
great
progress
during
the
man
statement
like
a
magnetic
needle
which
has
been
slightly
deranged
by
some
accident
her
judgment
had
wavered
about
a
good
deal
but
it
pointed
right
at
last
first
she
came
to
the
conclusion
from
the
man
speech
that
colonel
middleton
was
not
what
he
appeared
to
be
and
then
that
he
was
certainly
henry
hayley
how
to
act
what
to
say
however
she
did
not
know
and
all
she
could
utter
was
well
well
well
as
you
say
rejoined
mingy
bowes
the
matter
no
doubt
will
be
easily
settled
for
my
friend
who
found
the
book
is
quite
inclined
to
be
reasonable
he
quite
a
shy
timid
young
man
and
he
asked
me
to
arrange
the
matter
for
him
know
bowes
he
said
to
me
one
has
got
hold
of
such
a
secret
as
this
it
is
all
fair
that
he
should
make
something
out
of
it
but
i
do
want
to
behave
at
all
unhandsome
so
i
wish
you
would
go
and
see
what
can
be
done
and
i
content
myself
with
a
trifle
bowes
he
said
is
your
name
bowes
asked
lady
fleetwood
who
as
i
have
before
remarked
had
a
terrible
habit
of
darting
off
at
a
tangent
yes
replied
her
visiter
my
name
is
bowes
mingy
bowes
at
your
service
it
a
very
good
name
said
lady
fleetwood
there
was
a
bowes
i
used
to
know
very
well
who
lived
down
near
durham
i
wonder
if
you
are
any
relations
no
none
at
all
answered
mingy
bowes
i
never
had
no
relations
at
all
oh
dear
yes
you
must
have
had
some
relations
at
some
time
and
lady
fleetwood
set
hard
to
work
to
prove
to
bowes
that
at
some
time
or
another
he
must
have
had
some
relations
if
nothing
better
than
a
father
and
mother
a
fact
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
controvert
but
returned
at
once
like
a
man
of
business
to
the
more
immediate
subject
of
discourse
lady
fleetwood
little
excursion
however
had
done
her
good
it
had
suffered
her
mind
to
repose
and
compose
itself
and
if
she
made
any
mistakes
now
it
was
not
because
she
was
agitated
and
confused
well
you
see
my
lady
continued
mingy
bowes
i
said
to
the
gentleman
who
found
the
book
do
you
go
yourself
no
says
he
go
i
only
want
what
fair
and
i
leave
you
to
judge
of
that
so
then
i
said
to
him
would
you
think
of
a
thousand
pounds
so
then
he
answered
that
will
do
though
it
ought
to
be
fifteen
hundred
this
was
coming
to
the
point
bowes
imagined
and
doubted
not
that
lady
fleetwood
would
take
the
matter
up
at
once
as
he
intended
it
he
was
a
little
surprised
and
disappointed
however
when
after
he
had
made
a
dead
stop
and
waited
for
a
moment
or
two
the
excellent
lady
coolly
demanded
and
pray
what
have
i
to
do
with
all
this
what
made
you
come
to
me
about
it
mingy
bowes
however
was
rarely
puzzled
for
an
answer
sometimes
plunging
into
the
rigmarole
sometimes
taking
refuge
in
the
most
laconic
brevity
why
you
see
we
talked
that
over
too
he
said
my
friend
wished
me
to
go
to
the
colonel
at
once
about
it
but
i
said
that
wo
be
delicate
if
there
any
friend
we
could
get
to
break
the
matter
to
him
then
says
he
to
lady
fleetwood
the
person
you
may
give
her
my
solemn
word
of
honour
that
if
i
have
the
thousand
pounds
i
not
say
a
single
word
to
nobody
and
very
likely
says
he
she
never
say
a
word
to
him
about
it
but
give
the
money
herself
as
she
going
to
marry
him
what
i
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
almost
with
a
shriek
did
he
mean
i
was
going
to
marry
colonel
middleton
yes
my
lady
replied
mingy
bowes
almost
as
much
astonished
as
she
was
why
you
told
me
so
almost
this
minute
yourself
you
impudent
person
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
angrily
i
should
as
soon
think
of
marrying
you
as
colonel
middleton
i
am
quite
old
enough
to
be
his
mother
but
what
you
said
about
the
connection
said
mingy
bowes
with
a
good
deal
of
perturbation
seeing
that
he
had
made
one
mistake
at
least
and
not
knowing
how
far
it
had
gone
oh
now
i
see
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
my
good
friend
you
and
i
have
been
playing
at
cross
purposes
all
this
time
i
have
no
personal
interest
in
colonel
middleton
whatsoever
though
i
am
told
he
is
going
to
be
married
to
a
relation
of
mine
then
hang
me
if
i
not
wasted
my
time
said
mingy
bowes
starting
up
from
the
table
but
just
at
that
moment
a
bright
thought
one
of
her
own
peculiar
bright
thoughts
came
across
lady
fleetwood
mind
i
must
not
let
this
man
go
away
altogether
disappointed
she
said
for
fear
he
should
go
and
make
terrible
mischief
i
see
the
whole
business
as
clear
as
possible
now
this
colonel
middleton
is
poor
henry
hayley
and
maria
knows
it
that
is
the
secret
she
would
not
tell
me
and
she
knows
or
thinks
that
he
can
prove
himself
innocent
of
the
forgery
in
a
few
days
now
if
i
let
this
man
go
away
dissatisfied
he
may
very
likely
spoil
all
their
plans
i
know
nothing
about
it
how
should
i
know
and
if
maria
had
thought
fit
to
tell
me
all
i
might
have
known
how
to
act
for
i
sure
no
one
was
ever
more
thoroughly
convinced
that
poor
henry
hayley
however
much
appearances
might
be
against
him
never
did
think
of
forging
my
brother
name
than
i
have
always
been
as
to
giving
the
man
a
thousand
pounds
that
is
out
of
the
question
for
i
have
got
it
to
give
and
if
henry
is
innocent
as
i
am
sure
he
is
there
can
be
no
need
of
it
but
yet
if
i
send
him
away
disappointed
and
angry
he
may
make
a
fuss
which
is
always
exceedingly
unpleasant
she
puzzled
herself
sorely
as
to
what
was
best
to
be
done
under
these
perplexing
circumstances
but
at
length
a
notable
scheme
presented
itself
to
her
mind
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
time
and
suffering
the
plans
of
maria
and
henry
hayley
to
develop
themselves
undisturbed
early
the
day
after
she
thought
we
set
out
with
lady
anne
for
the
north
and
if
i
tell
this
man
to
come
here
at
noon
on
that
day
we
shall
be
gone
colonel
middleton
and
all
in
the
mean
time
i
can
consult
about
it
and
should
there
be
any
necessity
leave
a
note
or
a
message
to
give
explanations
and
to
make
arrangements
the
man
must
see
that
i
can
not
decide
upon
anything
at
once
although
thought
is
very
rapid
and
though
this
and
a
great
deal
more
passed
through
the
mind
of
lady
fleetwood
in
a
very
few
moments
yet
the
pause
was
sufficiently
long
to
attract
the
attention
of
mingy
bowes
and
make
him
linger
still
in
the
hope
of
bringing
his
negotiation
to
some
more
satisfactory
conclusion
although
he
was
terribly
tempted
to
say
something
more
yet
like
a
wise
man
he
refrained
from
a
sort
of
intuitive
perception
that
the
weakness
of
the
other
party
might
do
something
for
him
which
his
own
strength
could
not
accomplish
he
did
not
walk
to
the
door
however
as
his
first
sudden
start
up
from
the
table
had
seemed
to
promise
and
at
length
he
was
rewarded
by
hearing
lady
fleetwood
voice
once
again
i
can
have
very
little
to
do
with
this
business
she
said
but
at
the
same
time
as
the
gentleman
is
a
very
intimate
friend
and
is
likely
to
be
a
connection
of
some
members
of
my
family
i
have
no
objection
whatever
to
talk
to
him
upon
the
subject
and
see
what
he
thinks
fit
to
do
mingy
bowes
was
very
well
disposed
to
listen
to
this
offer
as
to
say
truth
he
had
only
come
there
for
the
purpose
of
opening
a
negotiation
to
be
carried
to
greater
advantages
at
a
future
period
a
little
bluster
however
he
thought
might
be
as
well
and
he
replied
gruffly
well
i
hope
you
make
haste
about
it
then
for
we
much
time
to
spare
and
my
friend
must
do
one
thing
or
the
other
so
if
the
gentleman
says
yes
well
and
if
he
says
no
well
we
can
but
go
and
tell
scriven
and
the
whole
story
after
all
dear
me
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
you
seem
to
know
all
the
people
about
here
quite
well
scriven
is
my
brother
however
i
sha
be
able
to
see
and
consult
anybody
till
the
day
after
so
if
you
like
to
come
here
at
twelve
on
that
day
you
shall
have
an
answer
yes
or
no
that
a
long
while
said
mingy
with
a
good
deal
of
affected
sullenness
i
should
think
for
that
matter
a
lady
like
you
might
give
such
a
trifle
herself
without
waiting
to
consult
at
all
you
very
much
mistaken
sir
answered
lady
fleetwood
sharply
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
called
upon
to
give
anything
as
the
gentleman
is
no
connection
of
mine
whatever
in
the
next
place
i
do
not
know
whether
it
would
be
right
to
give
anything
at
all
and
in
the
third
i
should
not
know
how
much
to
give
but
at
all
events
you
have
my
answer
and
can
come
at
twelve
the
day
after
or
not
just
as
you
think
fit
oh
i
come
said
mingy
bowes
but
you
better
tell
the
gentleman
my
lady
that
if
he
does
not
come
down
handsome
he
done
to
a
dead
certainty
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
sir
said
lady
fleetwood
but
at
all
events
i
can
not
talk
any
more
upon
the
subject
and
therefore
shall
beg
to
wish
you
good
morning
thus
saying
she
rang
the
bell
sharply
and
made
a
ceremonious
curtsey
to
mingy
bowes
saying
aloud
to
the
servant
who
appeared
show
that
person
out
and
if
he
comes
at
twelve
the
day
after
let
me
see
him
chapter
xxvii
there
a
person
below
inquiring
for
your
excellency
said
colonel
middleton
foreign
servant
entering
the
where
his
master
sat
writing
a
note
who
is
he
carlini
asked
the
young
officer
looking
up
is
it
the
same
man
who
was
here
before
no
sir
replied
the
servant
this
is
a
taller
stouter
man
dressed
somewhat
like
the
other
he
says
you
know
him
and
that
his
name
is
joshua
brown
oh
show
him
up
show
him
up
said
colonel
middleton
i
will
see
him
by
all
means
the
servant
retired
and
in
a
moment
or
two
returned
with
our
good
friend
the
pedlar
but
joshua
brown
face
upon
the
present
occasion
bore
an
expression
which
in
the
course
of
their
short
acquaintance
colonel
middleton
had
never
seen
it
assume
it
was
a
sort
of
hesitating
undecided
expression
very
different
from
the
frank
and
easy
though
unpresuming
manner
which
he
generally
displayed
in
addressing
persons
whom
he
looked
upon
as
his
superiors
henry
remarked
it
but
at
the
same
time
he
treated
the
man
exactly
as
he
would
otherwise
have
done
saying
sit
down
brown
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
have
you
brought
me
any
information
a
little
sir
replied
the
pedlar
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
is
not
all
good
about
the
oh
never
mind
the
for
the
present
said
colonel
middleton
that
is
of
very
little
consequence
compared
with
the
certificate
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
sir
answered
the
pedlar
i
hope
you
may
think
so
still
when
i
told
you
all
as
to
the
certificate
there
it
is
i
thought
i
should
know
my
way
back
i
do
forget
very
easily
and
i
walked
yesterday
straight
as
a
line
to
the
place
where
i
thought
it
was
to
be
found
the
old
clerk
dead
and
a
dapper
young
fellow
in
his
place
who
found
it
out
in
a
minute
you
owe
me
sir
for
that
a
great
deal
more
said
colonel
middleton
his
eyes
fixed
thoughtfully
upon
the
paper
mary
westfield
he
continued
reading
aloud
how
far
is
that
from
town
about
sixteen
miles
sir
replied
the
man
is
that
the
name
you
expected
to
find
exactly
replied
henry
placing
the
paper
in
his
it
only
confirms
what
i
knew
before
humph
said
the
pedlar
in
a
very
peculiar
tone
but
he
added
something
more
and
henry
looking
up
said
now
for
the
my
good
friend
why
i
suppose
you
guess
sir
by
this
time
that
i
have
not
got
it
replied
the
pedlar
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
we
shall
never
get
it
now
indeed
exclaimed
colonel
middleton
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
disappointment
how
has
that
happened
have
they
destroyed
it
they
have
sir
said
joshua
brown
and
that
in
my
presence
too
and
he
looked
in
the
face
of
colonel
middleton
with
a
keen
and
inquisitive
expression
as
if
seeking
to
form
a
judgment
from
what
he
there
beheld
regarding
some
doubtful
questions
in
his
own
mind
that
is
unpleasant
said
colonel
middleton
in
a
grave
but
ordinary
tone
as
if
he
had
lost
in
the
the
value
of
a
thousand
pounds
or
more
now
let
the
reader
remark
and
remember
that
a
man
face
and
manners
bear
a
very
different
expression
when
he
has
lost
something
very
valuable
which
he
regrets
much
and
would
give
a
great
deal
to
recover
and
when
something
has
occurred
which
generates
apprehension
the
passions
are
different
and
so
are
their
effects
in
one
instance
they
have
reference
to
the
past
and
in
the
other
reference
to
the
future
and
nothing
can
be
more
different
than
the
looks
of
regret
and
fear
now
all
that
colonel
middleton
felt
or
seemed
to
feel
was
regret
well
tell
me
how
it
all
happened
he
said
curious
that
they
should
burn
it
in
your
presence
when
they
had
the
certainty
of
getting
a
considerable
sum
of
money
for
it
joshua
brown
set
to
work
to
convince
him
that
nothing
in
the
world
could
be
more
natural
but
he
did
not
altogether
succeed
i
am
afraid
said
colonel
middleton
that
these
good
gentry
must
have
discovered
that
there
was
something
very
important
to
me
in
that
but
why
they
should
burn
it
i
can
not
conceive
it
was
curious
to
remark
the
changes
of
expression
which
came
over
the
plain
and
almost
harsh
features
of
the
pedlar
during
his
conversation
with
colonel
middleton
and
certainly
if
the
face
is
in
any
degree
the
index
of
the
mind
he
underwent
more
changes
of
emotion
that
day
than
were
at
all
customary
with
him
a
look
almost
of
anxiety
now
came
into
his
face
as
he
answered
i
am
afraid
sir
that
they
had
found
out
how
important
the
was
to
you
and
had
arranged
all
their
plans
to
make
what
they
call
a
good
job
out
of
it
nevertheless
i
do
think
that
they
were
quite
clear
as
to
all
the
little
particulars
so
that
perhaps
they
ca
do
as
much
mischief
as
they
would
colonel
middleton
paused
in
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
said
with
a
grave
look
as
far
as
i
can
remember
the
contents
of
that
book
were
quite
sufficient
to
afford
them
the
means
of
discovering
the
whole
particulars
of
a
transaction
long
past
which
i
do
not
wish
to
revive
but
what
could
make
them
destroy
the
i
can
not
conceive
for
the
contents
must
have
induced
them
to
believe
that
its
preservation
would
be
much
more
profitable
to
them
than
its
destruction
i
afraid
sir
replied
the
pedlar
frankly
that
i
did
not
altogether
manage
the
matter
for
you
well
you
see
sir
i
was
ignorant
of
the
circumstances
you
had
told
me
how
much
you
would
give
and
i
did
not
like
to
offer
more
especially
when
the
rascal
who
had
got
the
book
tried
to
exact
more
by
threats
by
threats
did
he
said
colonel
middleton
how
much
did
you
offer
my
good
friend
i
offered
a
hundred
pounds
sir
as
you
said
and
to
make
them
think
that
i
had
no
interest
in
the
matter
i
pretended
to
require
something
for
myself
out
of
the
money
there
was
my
mistake
i
think
oh
no
replied
henry
with
a
degree
of
indifference
which
surprised
the
pedlar
very
much
i
think
you
did
quite
right
i
would
not
have
given
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
that
was
quite
enough
then
the
blackguard
must
have
been
making
a
great
mistake
said
joshua
brown
with
a
relieved
look
for
he
seemed
quite
sure
that
you
would
give
a
great
deal
more
and
said
there
was
that
in
the
which
might
hang
you
or
save
you
and
you
half
believed
him
my
good
friend
replied
the
young
officer
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
while
the
colour
mounted
up
in
the
pedlar
brown
cheek
but
if
you
had
considered
one
moment
brown
you
would
have
seen
that
had
that
book
contained
as
the
ruffian
said
the
means
of
hanging
me
he
would
never
have
thought
of
destroying
documents
that
gave
him
such
a
power
over
me
no
to
be
plain
with
you
the
book
did
contain
full
and
satisfactory
proofs
of
my
innocence
of
an
act
once
imputed
to
me
by
destroying
them
the
villain
did
me
a
great
disservice
but
thank
god
they
are
not
the
only
proofs
and
those
that
still
exist
i
trust
will
be
sufficient
well
sir
said
brown
i
am
sorry
i
attended
to
the
man
at
all
and
if
i
had
but
thought
a
bit
as
you
say
i
must
have
seen
that
his
conduct
and
his
words
were
not
consistent
however
what
made
him
burn
the
was
the
sight
of
a
constable
walking
up
and
down
before
the
house
the
two
scoundrels
chose
to
think
that
i
had
brought
him
there
and
that
as
soon
as
i
had
got
the
book
i
should
give
them
into
custody
so
away
it
went
into
the
fire
in
a
minute
and
i
could
not
get
it
out
for
they
were
two
to
one
and
though
master
mingy
bowes
is
a
little
one
his
comrade
is
worth
two
of
me
at
any
time
so
one
is
a
little
man
said
colonel
middleton
thoughtfully
try
and
describe
him
to
me
yet
stay
a
minute
and
ringing
the
bell
he
ordered
the
waiter
to
send
his
servant
as
soon
as
carlini
had
entered
the
room
colonel
middleton
said
now
go
on
brown
i
merely
wished
my
servant
to
hear
your
description
of
this
good
gentleman
you
mark
it
carlini
and
let
me
know
whether
it
seems
to
be
the
same
person
who
was
here
this
morning
the
pedlar
who
as
i
have
before
shown
was
a
very
minute
and
accurate
observer
proceeded
to
give
a
full
and
particular
account
of
the
personal
appearance
of
mingy
bowes
while
the
italian
stood
by
and
listened
bending
his
head
gravely
and
approvingly
from
time
to
time
as
the
other
proceeded
when
at
length
joshua
brown
paused
carlini
turned
to
his
master
saying
the
same
sir
exactly
and
then
at
a
sign
retired
now
then
brown
who
is
this
person
demanded
colonel
middleton
for
it
seems
he
is
not
the
person
who
actually
had
the
no
sir
he
the
replied
the
pedlar
that
to
say
the
receiver
and
it
was
at
his
house
i
saw
the
other
man
whose
name
i
do
not
know
any
more
than
that
it
is
sam
well
this
man
called
here
said
colonel
middleton
and
i
suppose
the
object
now
is
to
extort
money
from
me
by
threats
do
you
doubt
it
sir
said
joshua
brown
that
a
game
which
is
always
playing
in
london
and
those
as
soon
as
once
they
are
fixed
never
let
go
till
they
have
drained
every
drop
of
blood
out
of
a
man
body
there
are
many
thousands
of
them
in
this
city
who
live
by
nothing
else
many
a
man
they
break
down
in
health
as
well
as
in
fortune
and
happiness
and
many
another
they
drive
to
commit
suicide
weak
and
pitiful
must
their
victims
be
said
colonel
middleton
somewhat
contemptuously
for
none
but
a
mere
slave
to
fear
would
yield
to
threats
which
he
must
know
would
necessarily
go
on
increasing
in
virulence
i
not
quite
sure
of
that
sir
replied
the
pedlar
all
men
have
their
weaknesses
and
i
believe
all
men
have
their
timid
side
it
is
a
part
of
the
trade
of
such
fellows
as
these
to
find
out
where
a
man
is
likely
to
be
afraid
and
hunt
him
down
upon
that
i
have
known
many
a
very
brave
man
who
would
have
fought
anybody
or
anything
but
who
could
not
face
an
accusation
colonel
middleton
meditated
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
replied
these
scoundrels
will
find
themselves
very
much
mistaken
if
they
fancy
that
such
fears
will
influence
me
i
think
they
will
sir
replied
the
pedlar
but
i
would
advise
you
to
be
careful
what
you
do
with
them
for
i
think
a
cunninger
thief
was
never
known
than
that
same
mingy
bowes
and
if
he
can
not
manage
one
way
depend
upon
it
he
try
another
without
success
answered
henry
but
now
my
good
friend
as
to
you
i
am
considerably
indebted
for
many
services
i
would
fain
settle
that
account
before
we
part
that
you
may
not
think
me
ungrateful
oh
sir
i
have
no
claim
to
make
replied
the
pedlar
i
am
very
glad
to
have
served
you
and
the
loss
of
time
has
not
been
much
i
should
like
however
to
know
how
this
other
business
goes
on
and
i
should
not
be
sorry
to
see
master
mingy
bowes
myself
and
talk
to
him
a
bit
upon
what
he
about
for
i
might
give
you
some
sort
of
hint
that
would
be
serviceable
henry
hayley
seemed
to
think
for
a
moment
over
the
proposal
before
he
answered
but
at
length
he
replied
well
be
that
as
you
like
it
can
do
no
harm
and
might
perchance
do
some
good
i
suppose
that
beyond
all
doubt
one
or
both
of
the
two
villains
will
be
here
ere
long
again
and
if
you
were
to
remain
at
the
hotel
and
meet
them
unexpectedly
when
they
come
they
might
feel
not
very
pleasantly
surprised
my
servant
shall
take
care
of
you
if
you
like
to
stay
as
for
myself
i
shall
away
at
once
to
mary
westfield
the
pedlar
smiled
i
will
tell
you
what
sir
he
said
you
may
want
me
in
that
business
too
before
long
and
so
when
i
go
away
from
here
i
shall
tell
your
servant
where
i
am
to
be
found
when
needed
i
do
not
think
you
can
be
of
any
more
service
to
me
there
than
you
have
been
already
replied
henry
but
nevertheless
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
your
address
we
shall
see
sir
we
shall
see
said
the
pedlar
do
think
me
impertinent
but
i
know
something
of
almost
everything
under
the
sun
and
more
of
this
matter
than
a
great
many
indeed
said
henry
pray
tell
me
how
that
may
be
no
no
sir
answered
the
pedlar
not
just
yet
i
only
ask
one
favour
of
you
which
is
that
you
will
always
let
me
know
where
you
are
to
be
found
for
the
next
six
weeks
and
i
do
the
same
by
you
henry
laughed
saying
well
my
good
friend
i
will
agree
to
the
compact
though
it
is
somewhat
carlini
he
continued
speaking
to
his
servant
who
entered
with
a
note
take
care
of
this
good
gentleman
who
has
been
of
great
service
to
me
lately
and
if
that
person
returns
who
was
inquiring
for
me
this
morning
let
brown
deal
with
him
as
he
knows
something
of
him
yes
your
excellency
replied
the
valet
but
lady
anne
servant
is
waiting
for
an
answer
henry
unfolded
the
letter
and
read
i
will
go
directly
he
replied
send
a
chaise
after
me
carlini
to
lady
anne
i
shall
not
be
home
to
dinner
most
likely
not
till
eight
but
certainly
by
that
time
in
the
mean
time
take
care
of
mr
brown
thus
saying
he
retired
for
a
moment
into
his
returned
with
his
hat
and
some
papers
in
his
hand
and
set
out
at
once
leaving
his
servant
and
the
pedlar
together
chapter

perhaps
no
two
animals
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
have
fewer
points
of
attraction
for
each
other
in
all
ordinary
circumstances
than
a
plain
english
peasant
and
an
italian
valet
when
joshua
brown
and
carlo
carlini
were
left
together
in
the
of
the
master
of
the
latter
there
was
but
one
single
link
of
sympathy
between
them
and
that
a
very
remote
and
indirect
one
every
italian
i
believe
not
from
nature
perhaps
but
from
the
circumstances
and
accidents
of
his
country
has
more
or
less
of
the
pedlar
in
him
he
is
always
dealing
with
some
kind
of
wares
religious
political
moral
philosophical
even
if
they
be
not
commercial
in
the
ordinary
sense
wherein
he
is
very
sharp
too
he
is
always
exalting
these
wares
with
praise
and
magnifying
his
own
information
and
capabilities
and
he
is
nine
times
out
often
trying
to
make
you
believe
that
pinchbeck
is
gold
and
that
an
italian
is
an
old
roman
i
speak
generally
without
meaning
to
say
for
one
moment
that
there
are
not
many
exceptions
but
still
between
such
a
man
as
joshua
brown
and
such
another
as
carlo
carlini
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
tie
namely
the
pedlarism
which
i
have
mentioned
there
were
however
in
reality
other
and
better
ties
which
they
found
out
after
a
time
and
strange
to
say
the
most
powerful
of
these
was
honesty
of
purpose
will
you
come
down
with
me
sir
and
take
a
glass
of
wine
said
carlo
carlini
to
the
pedlar
well
knowing
what
his
master
injunction
to
take
care
of
his
guest
implied
or
perhaps
you
have
not
dined
sir
and
would
like
something
more
solid
there
was
a
certain
dignity
and
grace
about
the
man
nothing
abated
by
his
foreign
accent
and
look
which
had
a
good
deal
of
effect
upon
the
pedlar
whose
general
notions
of
valets
and
valetry
were
not
very
sublime
really
thought
joshua
brown
this
is
quite
a
grand
sort
of
a
man
one
would
take
him
for
a
prince
in
disguise
if
one
did
know
better
he
seems
no
way
proud
however
but
just
like
his
master
here
his
contemplations
came
to
an
end
and
he
replied
with
a
low
bow
thank
you
sir
i
have
not
dined
as
to
wine
it
very
little
of
it
i
get
for
there
less
of
it
in
our
country
than
in
yours
i
take
it
and
not
very
good
either
there
is
plenty
of
very
good
wine
in
england
said
carlini
shaking
his
head
solemnly
backwards
and
forwards
only
very
dear
brown
but
my
master
who
is
a
rich
man
and
a
liberal
one
does
not
grudge
me
my
glass
of
wine
knowing
that
i
have
been
accustomed
to
it
all
my
life
as
well
as
himself
for
we
both
come
from
countries
where
there
is
nothing
else
but
wine
to
be
drunk
except
water
is
not
your
master
an
englishman
then
asked
brown
no
a
spaniard
to
be
sure
replied
carlini
with
a
start
what
made
you
think
he
was
an
englishman
why
his
language
his
name
his
manner
his
look
said
joshua
brown
all
made
me
feel
sure
he
was
an
englishman
oh
as
to
his
language
said
carlini
he
speaks
italian
spanish
and
french
just
as
well
as
he
does
english
and
then
as
to
his
name
that
his
father
name
and
he
was
an
englishman
his
manners
and
appearance
may
be
english
too
but
nevertheless
he
has
lived
with
spaniards
all
his
life
having
been
brought
up
as
the
nephew
and
heir
of
don
balthazar
de
xamorça
but
come
let
us
go
down
brown
you
shall
have
some
dinner
and
then
we
will
have
a
quiet
glass
of
wine
together
as
you
call
it
in
england
joshua
brown
followed
his
new
friend
down
to
a
small
room
on
the
sunk
story
meditating
very
profoundly
as
he
went
there
was
something
that
puzzled
him
greatly
he
could
not
make
the
two
broken
ends
of
colonel
middleton
story
fit
at
all
and
at
last
he
convinced
himself
that
the
servant
must
have
made
a
mistake
he
can
not
have
been
long
in
colonel
middleton
service
he
thought
i
will
find
out
how
long
he
has
been
with
him
in
pursuance
of
this
resolution
joshua
brown
after
having
comforted
the
inner
man
with
some
very
soft
and
savoury
viands
and
as
soon
as
a
glass
of
not
bad
wine
was
placed
in
his
hand
looked
across
to
signor
carlini
with
a
very
shrewd
expression
of
countenance
winking
his
eye
over
the
rich
juice
of
the
grape
and
saying
a
very
good
master
yours
carlini
i
should
think
one
does
not
meet
with
such
every
day
no
that
one
does
answered
carlini
heartily
no
one
has
an
easier
or
a
better
place
than
i
have
i
suppose
you
had
it
a
long
time
said
the
pedlar
in
an
inquiring
tone
about
five
years
replied
carlini
but
i
knew
him
three
or
four
years
before
that
ah
brown
one
sees
strange
changes
in
this
world
when
first
i
saw
my
present
master
he
brought
into
my
a
draft
for
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
i
paid
it
as
if
it
had
been
no
sum
at
all
the
next
time
i
saw
him
i
was
a
waiter
at
an
inn
and
when
he
paid
the
bill
he
gave
me
a
dollar
for
myself
without
knowing
me
again
that
is
a
strange
history
indeed
said
the
pedlar
how
came
you
to
have
such
a
fall
sir
oh
revolution
revolution
replied
carlini
revolution
by
which
poor
men
think
to
better
their
condition
but
which
always
ends
in
making
them
the
first
sufferers
it
was
the
revolution
in
the
new
world
that
ruined
me
but
as
it
only
brought
me
down
to
the
same
rank
from
which
i
rose
and
indeed
not
quite
to
that
i
have
no
cause
to
grumble
mine
a
very
strange
history
altogether
it
must
be
so
indeed
answered
joshua
brown
i
should
like
of
all
things
to
hear
it
i
always
like
to
hear
people
histories
carlini
not
for
curiosity
sake
only
but
because
there
is
always
something
in
them
to
show
us
how
good
god
is
to
all
his
creatures
and
to
make
us
contented
with
our
own
lot
and
also
to
hear
a
real
history
from
a
man
own
mouth
is
to
me
like
seeing
a
picture
especially
if
there
are
many
ups
and
downs
in
it
to
represent
the
mountains
and
the
valleys
well
said
carlini
take
another
glass
of
wine
and
i
tell
you
something
of
it
for
it
is
worth
listening
to
and
so
is
your
master
too
i
should
think
rejoined
brown
whose
curiosity
was
directed
more
towards
the
history
of
colonel
middleton
himself
than
that
of
his
servant
not
half
so
much
as
mine
answered
carlini
for
his
has
been
all
prosperity
from
beginning
to
end
and
mine
has
been
continually
changing
as
you
will
see
carlini
story
the
first
thing
that
i
remember
was
running
about
in
the
streets
of
naples
a
ragged
boy
without
shoes
stockings
jacket
or
hat
i
suppose
i
had
a
father
and
mother
if
i
did
but
know
who
they
were
but
of
that
they
took
very
good
care
i
should
never
be
informed
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
no
great
curiosity
on
the
subject
my
name
was
universally
admitted
by
all
my
companions
to
be
carlo
which
in
your
language
means
charles
and
when
i
was
about
eight
years
old
a
much
bigger
carlo
than
myself
having
joined
the
band
of
little
vagabonds
to
which
i
had
been
attached
from
infancy
i
acquired
the
name
of
carlini
which
in
your
language
means
little
charles
till
i
was
nine
years
old
where
i
slept
how
i
was
clothed
and
what
i
fed
upon
were
three
miracles
not
at
all
less
curious
than
the
liquefying
of
the
blood
of
januarius
but
at
nine
years
old
my
first
change
of
fortune
took
place
the
two
carlos
in
the
same
troop
could
not
agree
carloni
thrashed
carlini
and
carlini
immediately
deserted
i
remember
very
well
the
second
day
after
i
had
quitted
my
band
standing
with
a
faint
heart
and
a
feeling
of
exceeding
solitude
before
the
shop
of
a
barber
who
i
found
afterwards
had
just
lost
his
apprentice
by
fever
my
back
was
turned
to
the
shop
for
i
little
thought
that
any
good
would
come
out
of
it
for
me
when
i
suddenly
found
something
touch
me
and
turning
round
i
saw
a
basin
stretched
out
through
one
of
the
small
open
panes
while
the
voice
of
the
barber
exclaimed
boy
run
and
fill
that
with
fresh
water
at
the
fountain
i
need
not
say
how
gladly
i
ran
and
filling
the
basin
i
brought
it
back
but
to
make
sure
of
some
reward
i
did
not
give
it
in
at
the
window
again
but
carried
it
in
at
once
by
the
door
there
i
found
a
stout
tall
man
just
shaved
to
whom
the
barber
with
great
respect
handed
the
basin
of
water
into
which
his
face
and
eyes
were
immediately
plunged
seeing
the
barber
very
zealous
to
show
every
attention
in
putting
his
customer
dress
to
rights
i
thought
i
could
not
do
better
than
ape
his
civility
by
going
down
upon
my
knees
and
brushing
the
dust
off
the
stranger
shoes
with
the
ragged
sleeve
of
my
shirt
which
certainly
was
not
much
more
dirty
when
i
had
done
than
when
i
began
however
my
attention
pleased
the
stranger
and
he
gave
me
a
piece
of
copper
of
the
value
of
a
penny
it
was
the
first
money
i
recollect
ever
having
had
in
my
life
and
i
fancied
it
would
have
bought
half
of
naples
the
same
barber
shop
became
a
sort
of
treasury
to
me
for
two
months
i
continued
to
plant
myself
before
the
window
either
lying
on
the
stones
in
the
sun
and
pitching
little
bits
of
bones
to
and
fro
or
standing
and
watching
to
see
if
i
could
be
of
service
the
shaver
was
a
kind
old
man
enough
and
did
not
forget
me
from
time
to
time
he
would
throw
any
little
job
in
my
way
such
as
holding
a
gentleman
horse
brushing
his
shoes
or
carrying
a
message
and
when
there
was
nothing
of
this
kind
to
be
done
and
i
looked
very
hungry
he
would
give
me
two
or
three
handfuls
of
or
a
lump
of
bread
he
found
me
active
diligent
and
faithful
and
contriving
to
live
principally
upon
his
charity
and
to
save
all
the
little
sums
which
i
got
i
was
at
length
enabled
to
purchase
some
articles
of
decent
dress
and
appear
at
my
old
post
with
a
much
more
respectable
exterior
the
old
man
was
delighted
not
only
with
the
change
in
my
appearance
but
with
the
which
had
furnished
me
with
the
means
and
taking
me
into
his
shop
he
asked
me
a
great
number
of
questions
about
myself
preparatory
as
it
turned
out
to
engaging
me
in
his
service
he
could
not
have
found
one
whose
mind
was
more
open
to
instruction
than
mine
it
was
like
a
bag
ready
to
be
filled
for
there
was
actually
nothing
in
it
i
could
neither
read
write
nor
calculate
i
knew
no
tongue
but
the
jargon
of
the
and
i
did
even
know
my
own
name
which
was
perhaps
no
great
evil
after
all
well
at
the
end
of
three
days
from
that
time
i
was
fully
installed
as
barber
boy
i
learnt
to
shave
to
dress
hair
to
sharpen
razors
to
make
perfumes
and
cosmetics
to
bleed
and
on
an
occasion
to
draw
a
tooth
all
this
my
master
taught
me
gratis
he
having
my
services
at
the
same
rate
nevertheless
he
fed
me
and
though
neither
very
delicately
nor
very
abundantly
the
food
was
so
superior
to
any
i
had
ever
had
before
that
in
despite
of
a
lean
nature
i
grew
fat
the
little
gratuities
i
received
from
time
to
time
furnished
the
small
stock
of
clothes
i
wanted
and
enabled
me
to
get
some
instruction
in
matters
which
did
not
come
within
the
sphere
of
my
worthy
master
i
taught
myself
to
read
i
learned
to
write
i
acquired
a
competent
knowledge
of
arithmetic
i
picked
up
a
little
french
amongst
the
people
at
the
port
for
a
frenchman
thinks
that
every
one
is
bound
to
speak
his
language
and
that
he
is
bound
to
speak
none
but
his
own
i
learned
a
great
deal
of
spanish
without
any
difficulty
at
all
and
at
the
end
of
five
or
six
years
i
flattered
myself
that
i
was
a
very
accomplished
barber
my
old
master
was
now
beginning
to
be
stricken
in
years
and
much
less
active
than
he
had
been
so
that
at
length
we
divided
the
work
between
us
he
remaining
at
home
to
shave
and
dress
those
who
came
to
the
shop
and
i
going
out
to
the
more
courtly
customers
who
required
attendance
at
their
own
houses
the
business
still
remained
very
good
and
i
can
not
help
flattering
myself
that
i
had
some
share
in
keeping
it
up
and
increasing
it
my
old
master
seemed
so
far
sensible
that
this
was
the
case
as
spontaneously
to
offer
me
of
the
receipts
for
which
i
was
most
grateful
although
i
had
of
the
labour
i
had
a
sincere
affection
for
the
old
man
for
he
was
the
only
father
i
had
ever
known
but
he
was
not
destined
to
remain
long
with
me
i
was
not
nineteen
when
the
old
man
died
his
relations
claimed
his
shop
and
his
implements
even
to
an
old
which
would
have
rubbed
the
skin
off
a
rhinoceros
but
the
business
remained
with
me
i
took
the
shop
next
door
stocked
it
and
beautified
it
with
the
money
i
had
saved
and
was
shaving
powdering
and
pomatuming
from
morning
till
night
most
unluckily
a
spanish
grandee
who
passed
a
winter
in
naples
placed
his
head
and
chin
under
the
immediate
superintendence
of
carlo
carlini
i
was
soon
taken
into
great
favour
and
as
this
nobleman
was
about
to
return
to
his
own
country
in
the
spring
he
exerted
all
his
eloquence
to
persuade
me
that
my
talents
were
quite
thrown
away
in
the
city
of
naples
madrid
he
said
madrid
was
the
only
fitting
theatre
for
the
display
of
my
genius
it
was
the
elysium
of
barbers
where
i
was
certain
to
find
myself
completely
happy
he
offered
even
to
take
me
in
his
own
suite
defraying
all
my
expenses
by
the
way
and
he
promised
that
i
should
shave
every
friend
he
had
in
the
world
and
powder
and
perfume
all
his
mistresses
who
were
many
in
an
evil
hour
i
yielded
off
we
set
for
madrid
and
very
well
did
my
spanish
patron
keep
his
word
till
we
reached
that
city
i
fared
sumptuously
along
the
road
and
the
system
of
favouritism
being
universal
in
spain
i
was
considered
his
highness
favourite
and
treated
accordingly
but
unfortunately
after
our
arrival
in
madrid
wars
and
rumours
of
wars
broke
out
very
soon
and
the
duke
was
prevented
from
carrying
out
his
views
in
my
favour
by
the
strong
hand
of
death
which
seized
him
just
as
i
had
established
myself
in
the
spanish
capital
and
was
obtaining
a
little
of
the
promised
custom
my
days
of
prosperity
were
now
at
an
end
my
little
capital
gradually
diminished
my
patients
did
not
increase
my
stock
of
smart
clothing
wore
out
and
six
pairs
of
while
silk
stockings
absolute
necessaries
to
a
spanish
barber
were
reduced
to
three
as
the
very
utmost
neatness
and
cleanliness
are
required
in
that
country
you
may
easily
suppose
that
my
silk
stockings
made
frequent
visits
to
the
and
my
who
was
the
most
punctual
of
women
had
the
strictest
injunctions
to
return
that
indispensable
part
of
my
apparel
at
a
certain
hour
on
the
day
after
she
had
received
them
she
was
be
it
remarked
a
very
pretty
woman
and
had
captivated
the
heart
of
one
of
the
royal
guard
whom
i
not
unfrequently
saw
at
her
house
and
found
him
an
exceedingly
amiable
young
man
one
morning
as
my
good
fortune
would
have
it
my
silk
stockings
did
not
return
the
preceding
day
had
been
rainy
and
although
it
does
not
often
rain
in

yet
when
it
does
there
is
plenty
of
mud
in
the
streets
a
prince
and
a
duke
were
waiting
to
be
shaved
and
after
waiting
in
a
state
of
acute
anguish
for
i
was
obliged
to
sally
forth
in
my
dirty
stockings
i
lost
two
of
my
best
customers
but
fortune
and
misfortune
are
always
intimately
mingled
in
the
affairs
of
this
life
what
i
thought
my
ruin
was
the
dawn
of
my
most
prosperous
day
i
rushed
down
to
the
i
scolded
like
a
madman
about
my
silk
stockings
i
demanded
that
she
should
instantly
produce
them
she
could
not
do
so
and
i
accused
her
of
having
pawned
them
thereupon
she
burst
into
tears
and
acknowledged
that
she
had
lent
them
to
manuel
g
y
the
royal
guard
who
was
to
appear
that
day
on
duty
at
the
queen
dinner
a
mysterious
hint
had
been
given
him
by
an
old
lady
of
the
court
to
dress
himself
as
handsomely
as
possible
intimating
that
his
future
success
in
life
might
depend
very
much
upon
his
personal
appearance
as
soon
as
i
learned
that
they
had
been
lent
to
g
y
for
whom
i
had
a
real
regard
my
wrath
evaporated
him
keep
them
as
long
as
he
likes
i
said
tell
him
when
my
silk
stockings
have
made
his
fortune
i
hope
he
will
make
mine
but
in
the
mean
time
my
good
girl
though
i
have
only
two
pairs
left
you
must
contrive
that
i
have
a
clean
pair
each
day
the
girl
afterwards
assured
me
that
she
had
given
him
my
message
and
that
g
y
said
he
would
not
forget
me
but
what
was
my
surprise
not
a
week
after
to
hear
that
he
had
received
a
lieutenant
commission
in
his
corps
and
then
with
the
most
marvellous
rapidity
came
the
intelligence
of
his
being
a
captain
colonel
general
a
grandee
of
spain
a
prince
a
prime
minister
during
all
this
time
i
heard
nothing
of
him
and
i
concluded
footnote
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
that
this
story
of
carlo
carlini
was
told
to
the
author
word
for
word
as
it
is
here
written
down
by
carlo
carlini
himself
then
the
author
servant
i
can
not
forbear
adding
that
a
more
faithful
honest
intelligent
man
never
lived
and
that
after
having
left
my
service
on
my
return
to
england
he
entered
that
of
my
friend
the
late
scott
at
bordeaux
where
he
gained
the
esteem
of
all
and
died
i
believe
in
the
arms
of
his
young
master
the
present
mr
scott
here
is
that
person
again
sir
inquiring
for
the
colonel
said
the
inferior
waiter
whose
peculiar
task
it
was
to
attend
upon
the
gentlemen
send
him
in
send
him

said
carlini
stopping
in
his
story
you
brown
have
to
deal
with
him
you
know
the
moment
after
the
door
was
again
opened
and
mingy
bowes
entered
his
face
suddenly
assuming
a
look
of
extreme
surprise
on
perceiving
the
person
of
the
pedlar
before
him
chapter
xxix
it
was
a
fine
summer
afternoon
when
a
a
thing
by
no
means
uncommon
in
those
days
though
as
rare
as
a
bustard
at
present
dashed
into
the
small
town
of
belford
at
that
sort
of
pace
which
shows
postboys
if
not
horses
i
find
by
a
statistical
account
of
that
part
of
europe
which
lies
between
the
aln
and
the
tweed
and
which
in
former
days
was
frequently
subjected
to
inundation
from
the
great
northern
reservoir
of
mosstroopers
that
under
the
beneficial
influence
of
a
more
civilized
state
of
society
the
small
town
of
belford
had
increased
and
prospered
till
on
the
day
of
which
i
am
writing
it
was
computed
to
contain
no
less
than
one
hundred
and
and
nine
hundred
and
inhabitants
the
greater
proportion
of
the
inhabitants
possessed
no
stockings
and
very
few
shoes
i
say
the
greater
proportion
for
it
had
been
an
immemorial
privilege
of
that
portion
of
the
citizens
of
belford
which
had
not
yet
attained
the
age
of
fourteen
to
wear
upon
their
legs
and
feet
the
covering
with
which
nature
had
provided
them
and
none
else
some
of
the
higher
classes
with
that
neglect
of
their
rights
which
they
often
show
had
suffered
the
privilege
above
mentioned
to
fall
into
desuetude
the
children
of
the
clergyman
always
and
of
the
presbyterian
minister
sometimes
wore
shoes
and
stockings
so
also
did
those
of
the
doctor
the
lawyer
the
two
principal
shopkeepers
and
the
landlord
of
the
inn
but
all
or
very
nearly
all
the
rest
adhered
to
their
right
with
strong
determination
and
after
the
carriage
ran
a
multitude
of
boys
and
girls
whose
feet
had
never
been
tightened
and
spoiled
by
compression
in
cotton
or
leather
it
was
not
indeed
that
the
climate
of
belford
was
particularly
like
that
of
eden
which
dispensed
as
we
all
know
with
the
necessity
of
any
great
superfluity
of
garments
on
the
contrary
the
north
wind
visited
it
fresh
from
home
so
much
so
as
to
have
generated
a
despair
of
cultivation
which
after
efforts
have
proved
to
be
very
unreasonable
andrew
fairservice
crop
of
early
nettles
gave
in
those
days
a
very
fair
specimen
of
the
sort
of
horticulture
practised
at
belford
and
not
very
many
years
before
the
period
of
my
tale
an
old
woman
used
to
walk
through
the
town
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
crying
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
the
following
rare
and
in
many
instances
unknown
fruits
the
names
of
which
be
it
remarked
i
give
in
her
own
peculiar
dialect
though
i
can
not
convey
to
the
reader
any
idea
of
the
tone
something
between
a
song
and
a
squeal
in
which
she
offered
her
produce
to
the
public
hips
haws
slees
and
cherries
ripe
grosiers
nipes
turnips
sweet
as
honey
were
the
sounds
she
uttered
and
in
them
consisted
very
nearly
the
whole
catalogue
of
fruit
brought
to
market
at
belford
notwithstanding
all
this
the
town
contained
a
very
good
and
respectable
inn
where
at
one
time
were
no
fewer
than
sixteen
pair
of
as
at
that
period
it
was
generally
made
the
first
stage
northward
from
alnwick
rather
a
long
one
it
is
true
being
charged
fifteen
miles
but
many
persons
preferred
it
to
charlton
bells
must
certainly
have
acted
a
very
important
part
in
the
history
of
former
times
as
they
rival
the
most
distinguished
personages
and
the
most
splendid
objects
in
the
traditionary
veneration
of
innkeepers
and
neither
harts
nor
hinds
black
bulls
nor
red
lions
dolphins
nor
fountains
bushes
nor
cocks
great
generals
nor
gold
and
silver
crosses
can
boast
a
greater
number
of
votaries
nay
not
even
the
crown
the
sun
or
the
moon
the
image
of
a
large
bell
then
painted
in
blue
and
lipped
and
rimmed
with
gold
served
as
a
sign
to
the
principal
inn
at
belford
and
underneath
its
auspicious
bulk
drew
up
the
carriage
on
the
day
i
have
mentioned
horses
on
sir
asked
the
ostler
running
out
and
addressing
one
of
the
footmen
at
the
back
of
the
carriage
the
man
made
no
reply
and
mine
host
of
the
bell
seeing
his
ostler
repulsed
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
vehicle
while
the
two
servants
got
slowly
down
and
demanded
in
a
most
deferential
tone
if
he
should
put
on
four
more
quadrupeds
to
hurry
on
the
handsome
towards
the
north
he
looked
in
too
with
some
degree
of
curiosity
but
whatever
he
expected
to
see
nothing
was
perceived
within
excepting
always
a
but
a
very
girl
apparently
twenty
or
years
of
age
with
a
gay
bright
sparkling
countenance
and
a
crimson
velvet
polish
cap
bound
with
rich
sable
fur
and
ornamented
with
a
tassel
no
i
thank
you
said
the
lady
be
so
good
as
to
open
the
door
i
shall
stay
here
let
me
see
what
rooms
you
have
got
your
wife
i
suppose
you
have
got
a
wife
the
innkeeper
informed
her
that
her
supposition
was
correct
and
shouted
very
loudly
for
gunnel
while
the
carriage
door
was
opened
and
the
servants
assisted
their
mistress
to
alight
had
not
i
better
go
and
see
the
rooms
my
lady
said
the
maid
more
for
the
purpose
of
announcing
her
mistress
rank
to
the
numerous
bystanders
than
with
the
hope
of
saving
trouble
for
she
well
knew
the
lady
would
see
the
rooms
herself
and
with
all
reverence
gunnel
led
the
way
for
the
unexpected
guest
up
the
stairs
through
the
corridors
and
into
the
different
rooms
while
gunnel
followed
descanting
upon
the
excellence
of
the
beds
and
the
comfortableness
of
the
accommodation
this
room
for
myself
that
little
one
for
my
maid
the
large
one
beyond
for
a
lady
who
will
be
here
in
an
hour
or
two
and
all
the
rest
of
the
house
for
my
servants
said
the
young
lady
in
a
very
princessly
way
oh
this
is
the
sitting
room
i
suppose
she
continued
entering
an
adjoining
chamber
and
sitting
down
in
a
great
armchair
covered
with
white
dimity
i
wish
it
had
not
been
so
long
and
a
little
broader
gunnel
she
continued
eyeing
the
host
from
head
to
foot
gunnel
certainly
did
think
her
the
oddest
lady
he
had
ever
seen
but
it
is
wonderful
what
an
impression
oddity
joined
with
wealth
and
station
makes
upon
the
great
mass
of
human
beings
as
i
have
said
elsewhere
strength
of
character
is
the
most
commanding
of
all
things
and
it
is
probably
the
latent
conviction
that
a
man
must
have
strength
of
character
to
be
odd
which
renders
oddity
so
impressive
very
sorry
my
lady
replied
gunnel
with
the
most
profound
respect
but
it
is
the
only
one
we
have
got
except
a
very
little
one
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
the
commercial
room
it
will
do
it
will
do
gunnel
said
his
pretty
guest
playing
with
a
gold
which
she
had
got
chained
round
her
wrist
now
tell
me
something
about
yourself
how
old
are
you
mr
gunnel
lord
my
lady
exclaimed
the
landlady
if
gunnel
tells
you
that
he
will
tell
you
more
than
ever
he
would
tell
me
in
his
life
well
i
do
want
to
embarrass
him
answered
the
young
lady
with
a
smile
but
i
put
another
question
which
shall
do
as
well
how
long
have
you
been
in
this
house
mr
gunnel
oh
as
to
that
my
lady
replied
the
landlord
i
have
kept
the
years
come
next
twelfth
of
october
but
times
are
sadly
altered
since
i
first
set
up
oh
yes
replied
the
young
lady
they
are
always
altering
but
now
gunnel
have
fresh
horses
put
to
my
carriage
to
take
me
first
to
and
then
to
belford
castle
to
wait
and
bring
me
back
have
dinner
ready
for
me
and
the
lady
who
will
be
here
in
an
hour
or
two
at
seven
and
in
the
mean
time
collect
whatever
you
have
got
in
the
shape
of
upholsterers
and
and
let
them
know
that
i
shall
have
some
orders
to
give
them
bless
my
heart
said
the
landlord
if
i
do
think
it
is
lady
anne
mellent
we
shall
be
so
happy
to
see
somebody
at
the
old
place
again
why
my
lady
it
is
just
ten
years
and
three
or
four
months
since
your
ladyship
grandfather
died
and
not
a
soul
has
lived
in
the
castle
since
but
old
grimes
and
her
two
daughters
i
know
that
gunnel
said
lady
anne
rather
gravely
but
i
doubt
not
that
you
will
soon
see
it
inhabited
again
during
a
part
of
every
year
now
order
the
horses
and
have
the
things
ready
as
i
have
directed
my
servants
will
put
the
place
in
order
here
while
i
am
away
in
about
ten
minutes
lady
anne
was
once
more
in
her
carriage
now
disencumbered
of
its
packages
and
with
one
behind
was
rolling
away
towards
the
place
which
she
had
mentioned
called
at
the
distance
of
about
three
miles
from
belford
the
carriage
left
the
and
turned
into
a
narrow
country
lane
about
up
which
appeared
a
pair
of
iron
gates
passing
through
these
lady
anne
saw
before
her
a
very
broad
smooth
hard
road
well
kept
but
displaying
no
trace
of
cart
or
carriage
wheels
this
road
descended
a
gentle
slope
of
park
meadow
and
then
plunged
in
between
two
dark
masses
of
old
gigantic
trees
through
which
it
continued
its
course
for
nearly
when
it
issued
forth
again
another
wide
open
space
of
hill
turf
was
spread
out
to
the
eye
dotted
here
and
there
with
clumps
of
large
trees
and
at
a
little
distance
in
advance
rose
a
mansion
by
no
means
equal
in
appearance
to
that
which
the
extent
and
beauty
of
the
park
would
have
led
one
to
expect
it
was
a
house
of
ancient
date
very
irregular
in
its
form
with
gables
here
and
gables
there
and
large
stacks
of
chimneys
placed
in
the
most
extraordinary
positions
the
windows
were
small
but
innumerable
and
at
one
side
of
the
house
rose
a
tall
square
brick
tower
very
much
like
the
tower
of
an
old
kentish
church
in
great
part
covered
with
ivy
up
to
the
front
of
this
building
dashed
the
carriage
at
a
great
rate
in
the
midst
of
a
scene
so
still
and
solitary
that
but
for
the
house
one
might
have
fancied
the
place
a
desert
the
sound
of
a
great
bell
soon
brought
to
the
door
an
with
a
powdered
head
silk
stockings
and
lace
garters
round
his
knees
and
in
answer
to
lady
anne
question
if
hargrave
was
at
home
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
the
young
lady
then
alighted
and
followed
the
man
through
a
stone
hall
past
some
ten
or
twelve
doors
to
a
small
one
which
gave
her
admission
into
a
little
study
half
filled
with
books
and
old
pieces
of
armour
the
servant
merely
saying
as
he
threw
open
the
door
a
lady
wishes
to
speak
with
you
sir
the
personage
to
whom
this
was
addressed
deserves
some
description
for
i
do
not
think
there
is
one
of
the
genus
left
he
was
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
of
the
age
of
or
so
that
his
youthful
memories
must
have
referred
to
a
period
considerably
anterior
to
the
close
of
the
last
century
whether
it
was
a
clinging
to
these
youthful
memories
or
a
peculiar
taste
of
his
own
which
guided
the
old
gentleman
in
his
choice
of
dress
i
do
not
well
know
but
certainly
it
was
very
different
from
anything
that
lady
anne
was
accustomed
to
see
his
coat
besides
its
unusual
cut
was
distinguished
by
the
material
which
was
of
uncut
velvet
and
by
the
colour
which
was
of
a
yellowish
green
his
hair
was
powdered
and
drawn
back
into
a
large
mass
behind
which
was
bound
round
and
round
with
a
black
ribbon
two
large
curls
appeared
above
the
ears
but
the
forehead
was
left
completely
bare
his
waistcoat
was
of
white
satin
richly
embroidered
and
his
as
well
as
his
stockings
were
of
black
silk
while
in
the
shoes
and
at
the
knees
were
gold
buckles
in
short
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
been
laid
up
in
a
bandbox
for
fifty
years
and
taken
out
as
he
had
been
put
in
ready
dressed
for
a
ceremony
no
glance
of
recognition
beamed
in
hargrave
eyes
as
they
lighted
on
lady
anne
and
he
scanned
her
curiously
through
the
spectacles
with
which
his
face
was
usually
adorned
as
the
reader
knows
his
visiter
was
no
great
respecter
of
ceremonies
ever
acting
or
speaking
upon
the
first
impulse
and
taking
it
for
granted
that
whatever
she
said
or
did
was
sure
to
please
partly
from
a
conviction
of
her
own
sincerity
of
purpose
and
partly
from
having
always
found
that
her
oddities
were
very
successful
with
the
general
world
and
more
especially
with
elderly
gentlemen
lady
anne
therefore
took
a
quiet
and
somewhat
long
survey
of
the
person
before
her
till
he
not
very
well
satisfied
with
the
scrutiny
demanded
in
a
gay
and
lively
tone
a
touch
of
the
paternal
mingling
with
a
sort
of
light
which
was
the
mode
in
his
early
years
well
little
girl
what
do
you
want
with
me
here
is
your
humble
servant
at
your
disposal
in
every
respect
but
love
or
matrimony
lady
anne
understood
him
in
a
moment
and
seating
herself
in
the
armchair
opposite
she
replied
were
it
a
case
of
either
love
or
matrimony
i
probably
should
not
seek
you
hargrave
but
the
case
is
quite
the
reverse
i
have
come
to
see
you
upon
business
of
some
importance
you
do
not
know
me
but
i
know
you
and
what
i
desire
you
to
do
is
to
get
into
the
carriage
with
me
and
take
a
drive
of
twelve
or
thirteen
miles
nay
more
you
must
do
it
whether
you
like
it
or
not
the
old
gentleman
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
of
amusement
and
then
said
do
you
know
i
have
not
dined
nor
i
answered
lady
anne
though
i
wonder
at
you
for
the
men
who
wore
velvet
coats
always
dined
at
three
or
four
but
you
know
my
good
friend
that
ladies
always
have
their
own
way
and
so
i
intend
you
to
dine
with
me
wherever
i
am
i
always
arrange
everything
for
everybody
according
to
my
own
plan
and
though
people
are
frightened
at
the
beginning
they
are
always
very
well
pleased
in
the
end
i
assure
you
so
now
tell
your
servant
to
bring
you
your
roquelaure
and
your
hat
is
it
round
or
cocked
do
you
know
you
are
very
saucy
said
hargrave
in
reply
where
do
you
intend
to
take
me
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
me
i
shall
tell
you
nothing
about
it
replied
lady
anne
i
intend
it
to
be
a
clear
case
of
abduction
in
order
that
an
action
may
lie
and
be
decided
upon
the
merits
i
will
say
and
do
nothing
which
can
raise
the
slightest
technical
quibble
but
direct
you
immediately
to
get
your
hat
and
cloak
and
if
you
do
not
make
haste
i
shall
give
you
sufficient
cause
to
swear
that
you
go
in
personal
fear
that
will
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
vehicle
rejoined
hargrave
who
seemed
perfectly
to
enter
into
her
humour
is
it
an
open
carriage
or
a
shut
is
it
a
a
gig
a
phaeton
a
landau
a
coach
or
a
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
replied
lady
anne
it
is
my
own
travelling
carriage
and
you
shall
be
at
full
liberty
to
drop
into
the
corner
and
fall
sound
asleep
or
to
talk
to
me
the
whole
way
as
your
courtesy
may
decide
but
how
far
how
far
exclaimed
the
other
that
at
least
you
can
tell
me
why
as
far
as
milford
castle
answered
lady
anne
with
a
gay
and
smile
but
we
shall
be
back
in
plenty
of
time
for
dinner
so
you
shall
not
lose
the
meal
which
no
englishman
can
go
without
milford
castle
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
what
lady
anne
come
and
give
me
a
kiss
no
you
must
come
for
it
replied
lady
anne
five
years
ago
i
would
have
given
you
one
but
you
did
not
come
to
london
to
seek
it
and
now
you
must
take
it
if
you
want
it
the
old
gentleman
rose
from
his
seat
and
with
a
light
and
elastic
step
crossed
over
and
kissed
her
cheek
my
dear
child
he
said
i
am
really
glad
to
see
you
i
was
a
friend
of
your
father
and
your
grandfather
and
a
sort
of
connecting
harmonising
link
between
them
being
some
fifteen
years
younger
than
the
one
and
some
eighteen
years
older
than
the
other
i
was
the
mediator
when
they
quarrelled
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
was
not
unfrequently
and
although
i
am
and
always
have
been
a
man
of
the
old
while
your
father
was
a
man
of
the
new
world
i
believe
he
had
as
much
confidence
in
me
as
in
any
man
and
a
great
regard
for
me
likewise
he
wanted
me
to
be
one
of
your
guardians
but
inveterate
habit
my
dear
child
ties
me
to
this
seclusion
and
i
knew
i
must
either
neglect
duties
which
it
would
be
criminal
to
neglect
or
break
through
rules
which
at
my
age
it
would
be
no
longer
graceful
to
abandon
the
spirit
and
essence
of
englishism
if
i
may
so
call
it
that
which
marks
our
distinctive
character
that
which
renders
all
we
do
so
progressive
and
at
the
same
time
so
permanent
is
the
system
or
principle
or
habit
call
it
what
you
will
of
small
communities
acting
together
in
some
things
separate
from
in
some
things
dependent
upon
the
great
mass
of
the
nation
our
municipal
institutions
are
but
better
organised
types
of
that
which
exists
even
in
country
districts
where
round
a
few
men
of
property
and
intelligence
whose
duty
it
is
to
maintain
order
and
peace
and
as
far
as
in
them
lies
to
spread
happiness
and
prosperity
around
them
are
collected
a
multitude
of
persons
of
various
grades
of
wealth
and
intellect
who
have
a
right
to
look
to
those
above
them
for
advice
assistance
protection
and
support
now
no
man
placed
by
god
will
in
the
position
of
a
country
gentleman
has
any
title
to
abstract
himself
from
the
mass
amidst
which
god
will
has
planted
him
and
whom
his
influence
his
custom
his
example
his
advice
may
benefit
i
felt
that
i
ought
not
to
undertake
the
discharge
of
any
duties
incompatible
with
those
which
heaven
had
assigned
me
and
therefore
i
declined
to
be
one
of
your
guardians
although
i
must
ever
retain
a
sincere
affection
for
all
your
family
i
am
sure
you
do
hargrave
replied
lady
anne
and
therefore
in
my
impudent
way
i
came
boldly
to
see
you
i
think
you
were
quite
right
not
to
undertake
the
guardianship
of
a
giddy
girl
when
you
had
duties
so
much
more
important
to
perform
and
i
only
wish
all
our
country
gentlemen
entertained
such
views
of
their
duties
however
i
must
now
seriously
ask
you
to
drive
over
with
me
to
milford
castle
as
i
have
something
to
do
there
which
may
require
the
presence
of
a
magistrate
i
am
ready
this
moment
said
hargrave
ringing
the
bell
well
then
countermand
your
dinner
said
lady
anne
for
i
am
determined
that
you
shall
dine
with
me
i
have
not
dined
out
of
my
own
house
for
six
or
seven
years
replied
the
old
gentleman
and
it
will
be
a
long
way
back
at
night
from
milford
oh
that
is
not
where
you
are
going
to
dine
at
all
answered
his
fair
visiter
i
have
taken
the
whole
inn
at
belford
and
although
an
inn
dinner
may
not
afford
many
attractions
yet
let
me
tell
you
my
own
cook
will
be
down
in
an
hour
and
depend
upon
it
he
will
not
be
content
to
see
chickens
roasted
to
a
rag
and
raw
beefsteaks
set
before
his
mistress
even
in
northumberland
i
shall
take
up
my
at
milford
upholsterers
carpenters
will
be
as
busy
as
ants
till
three
or
four
and
about
five
i
expect
a
great
number
of
people
down
who
will
make
the
old
place
cheerful
again
after
the
long
reign
of
solitude
and
dulness
i
will
therefore
take
no
denial
for
i
have
a
great
deal
to
talk
to
you
about
before
these
people
come
down
and
i
have
nobody
with
me
now
but
my
good
old
governess
whose
presence
will
be
no
impediment
hargrave
hat
and
cloak
were
then
brought
and
after
having
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
servants
announced
that
he
should
not
be
home
to
dinner
he
followed
lady
anne
to
her
carriage
and
set
out
for
milford
castle
as
they
drove
along
the
worthy
old
man
was
somewhat
anxious
to
ascertain
what
lady
anne
could
want
with
a
magistrate
at
milford
but
his
fair
companion
seemed
to
be
in
one
of
her
wayward
moods
and
would
give
him
no
information
whatsoever
the
moment
that
he
found
she
was
reluctant
with
the
true
courtesy
of
the
old
school
he
changed
the
conversation
and
notwithstanding
a
great
degree
of
oddity
and
very
peculiar
views
on
many
points
proved
anything
but
an
unpleasant
companion
he
spoke
of
the
county
in
which
he
lived
the
changes
which
had
taken
place
in
it
during
his
own
lifetime
the
progress
which
it
was
making
and
the
improvements
which
still
might
be
made
lady
anne
was
a
good
deal
surprised
at
the
liberality
and
extent
of
view
which
he
displayed
in
conjunction
with
his
partial
adherence
to
old
habits
even
in
insignificant
things
but
hargrave
was
a
man
of
a
singular
mind
one
of
the
few
who
judged
of
all
things
solely
upon
their
merits
he
did
not
think
that
anything
was
worthy
of
being
retained
because
it
was
old
or
adopted
because
it
was
new
and
he
accidentally
explained
to
his
fair
companion
his
views
of
all
those
alterations
which
people
in
general
are
too
apt
to
look
upon
as
progress
when
very
often
the
direct
reverse
is
the
case
that
which
my
dear
lady
he
said
has
always
one
great
direct
advantage
over
that
which
certainty
long
experience
of
anything
existing
has
shown
mankind
all
its
benefits
and
all
its
evils
but
besides
this
there
is
an
indirect
advantage
in
retaining
that
which
is
namely
that
it
has
adjusted
itself
to
the
things
by
which
it
is
surrounded
and
there
is
a
direct
disadvantage
in
change
namely
that
one
can
never
calculate
what
derangements
of
all
relations
may
take
place
from
any
alteration
of
even
one
small
part
in
the
complicated
machine
of
any
state
or
society
nevertheless
i
hold
that
when
it
has
been
shown
that
many
things
have
altered
with
or
against
our
will
general
alterations
must
take
place
to
readjust
the
relations
which
have
been
changed
and
also
that
when
in
favour
of
any
change
that
is
proposed
there
can
be
shown
a
reasonable
probability
of
advantages
sufficient
to
counterbalance
the
inherent
evils
of
change
we
are
fully
justified
in
taking
the
forward
step
and
may
hope
to
reap
benefit
by
it
if
we
change
for
the
mere
sake
of
change
we
are
frenchmen
if
we
remain
stationary
from
mere
attachment
to
old
customs
we
are
chinese
i
think
the
english
nation
is
better
than
either
neither
like
youth
greedy
of
novelty
nor
like
age
tenacious
of
prejudices
but
like
maturity
guided
by
reason
either
in
tranquillity
or
action
the
saucy
girl
beside
him
laughed
i
have
no
doubt
it
all
very
true
she
said
but
i
am
not
a
politician
and
really
do
not
much
care
my
dear
sir
whether
we
stand
still
go
forward
or
go
backward
it
will
make
no
more
difference
to
me
than
whether
you
wear
a
velvet
coat
or
a
cloth
one
hargrave
now
laughed
in
turn
and
looking
down
at
his
sleeve
he
said
this
is
velvet
is
it
well
my
dear
i
did
not
know
it
i
have
remarked
indeed
occasionally
that
my
dress
is
somewhat
different
from
that
of
other
people
and
now
i
will
tell
you
how
it
has
happened
a
great
number
of
years
ago
some
fifty
i
dare
say
i
was
just
as
full
of
fancies
and
vanities
as
you
or
any
other
young
person
of
the
present
time
and
perhaps
was
a
little
bit
of
a
beau
and
might
affect
some
singularity
of
apparel
i
can
talk
of
the
matter
very
coolly
now
for
age
has
extinguished
passions
and
softened
even
bitter
memories
i
met
with
a
very
painful
disappointment
a
young
lady
to
whom
i
was
sincerely
attached
and
who
i
believe
was
sincerely
attached
to
me
died
in
a
moment
on
the
very
morning
appointed
for
our
marriage
i
bore
the
bereavement
i
am
sorry
to
say
neither
as
a
christian
nor
as
a
philosopher
and
i
soon
found
that
if
i
went
on
mingling
with
the
world
as
the
idle
and
light
portion
of
society
is
generally
called
i
should
lose
what
little
senses
i
still
possessed
i
determined
to
make
a
great
struggle
and
a
great
struggle
it
was
i
applied
myself
to
the
most
important
subjects
i
could
find
out
or
devise
i
studied
divinity
i
visited
the
poor
i
visited
hospitals
i
visited
prisons
for
ten
years
i
would
never
suffer
my
mind
to
rest
even
for
one
moment
upon
what
i
considered
a
trifle
and
my
directions
about
my
clothes
whenever
i
wanted
anything
new
were
to
make
them
exactly
like
those
which
i
was
wearing
at
the
end
of
these
ten
years
when
my
object
was
gained
and
my
mind
had
somewhat
recovered
its
tone
i
did
perceive
that
my
dress
was
somewhat
but
i
thought
it
was
not
worth
while
to
change
and
i
have
never
given
any
fresh
directions
since
thus
at
any
time
during
the
last
fifty
years
you
would
have
seen
me
in
a
coat
of
exactly
the
same
cut
of
the
same
colour
and
of
the
same
texture
four
times
in
the
year
it
comes
in
regularly
is
placed
upon
the
clotheshorse
in
my
room
and
i
put
it
on
often
without
knowing
that
it
is
new
unless
it
pinches
me
under
the
arms
i
certainly
shall
not
change
it
now
because
nobody
would
know
me
if
i
did
for
one
face
forms
so
small
a
part
of
one
personal
appearance
that
old
hargrave
coat
and
waistcoat
are
much
more
easily
recognised
i
fancy
than
old
hargrave
eyes
and
nose
would
be
you
a
dear
old
man
said
lady
anne
and
i
love
you
velvet
coat
and
all
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
replied
hargrave
for
i
have
loved
all
your
family
my
dear
very
truly
in
such
sort
of
conversation
passed
the
time
till
at
length
a
pair
of
great
gates
appeared
and
the
carriage
rolled
through
into
the
park
this
is
milford
castle
my
dear
said
hargrave
and
i
wish
you
joy
on
your
first
visit
to
the
home
of
your
ancestors
i
am
afraid
however
you
will
find
some
marks
of
neglect
at
all
events
on
the
outside
of
the
house
for
a
master
eye
is
like
sunshine
and
his
absence
like
storm
the
one
produces
all
that
is
bright
and
beautiful
the
other
is
sure
to
leave
some
traces
of
devastation
it
is
very
bare
said
lady
anne
looking
out
of
the
windows
of
the
carriage
and
how
stunted
all
the
trees
look
leaning
to
one
side
as
if
they
had
a
great
inclination
to
lay
themselves
down
and
die
the
prevailing
wind
said
hargrave
which
morally
and
physically
bends
all
things
to
its
influence
has
beaten
upon
them
for
so
many
years
that
they
may
well
have
yielded
to
it
but
you
will
find
the
scenery
improve
as
we
go
on
we
are
merely
at
the
outskirts
of
the
park
do
you
not
see
that
deep
wood
filling
up
the
hollow
that
is
the
first
grove
this
is
merely
a
sort
of
wild
chase
we
are
passing
through
rolling
on
the
scenery
did
as
he
said
improve
greatly
and
from
time
to
time
lady
anne
mellent
caught
a
distant
glimpse
of
an
old
grey
mansion
seen
and
lost
alternately
as
the
carriage
mounted
or
descended
the
manifold
slopes
of
the
park
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
thick
wild
wood
the
view
of
all
other
objects
and
in
a
minute
or
two
more
the
two
postboys
put
their
horses
into
a
quick
canter
up
a
steep
rise
and
lady
anne
suddenly
found
herself
at
the
gates
of
her
father
house
it
may
well
be
supposed
that
she
gazed
at
it
with
interest
and
the
aspect
pleased
her
well
for
it
was
a
large
stately
mansion
with
manifold
doors
and
windows
and
a
broad
terrace
before
it
but
on
looking
into
the
park
she
was
somewhat
mortified
to
see
that
several
hundred
acres
of
ground
around
the
house
had
been
lightly
enclosed
and
though
various
herds
of
deer
could
be
perceived
in
the
distance
nothing
but
sheep
rather
too
numerous
for
the
pasture
allotted
to
them
appeared
in
the
foreground
the
servant
rang
the
bell
sharply
and
having
opened
the
carriage
door
by
lady
anne
directions
aided
his
mistress
to
descend
she
was
very
grave
and
indeed
it
is
hardly
possible
to
look
up
at
an
old
building
especially
when
it
has
been
the
habitation
of
our
own
immediate
ancestors
without
feeling
impressed
with
a
chilling
sense
of
the
vanity
of
human
hopes
desires
and
efforts
an
old
mansion
is
a
sort
of
cemetery
of
dead
aspirations
every
stone
a
memento
of
joys
and
wishes
passed
away
of
course
nobody
answered
the
bell
but
a
shepherd
lad
was
seen
running
towards
the
back
of
the
house
and
lady
anne
forbade
the
footman
to
ring
again
after
a
minute
or
two
of
expectation
a
bustling
woman
opened
the
great
doors
with
a
face
glowing
like
the
rising
sun
and
hands
which
she
continued
to
wipe
in
her
apron
evidently
in
a
very
pulpy
and
state
she
looked
at
the
handsome
carriage
the
arms
it
bore
the
livery
of
the
servant
and
concluded
she
had
the
heiress
before
her
but
still
not
to
seem
too
ready
she
demanded
what
your
will
sir
what
do
you
wish
i
wish
to
go
over
the
house
my
good
lady
replied
lady
anne
i
suppose
you
are
grimes
i
am
lady
anne
mellent
your
mistress
dear
me
my
lady
i
wish
you
had
let
me
know
you
were
coming
said
the
good
woman
why
there
nothing
in
order
for
your
ladyship
and
we
have
nobody
to
help
to
put
things
right
lord
sir
i
did
know
you
she
continued
turning
to
lady
anne
companion
you
are
hargrave
i
believe
i
wonder
you
did
not
know
me
replied
the
old
gentleman
drily
looking
down
at
the
sleeve
of
his
velvet
coat
i
am
always
ticketed
but
do
not
keep
lady
anne
standing
here
do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
grimes
said
lady
anne
i
have
not
come
to
stay
but
i
shall
walk
over
the
whole
house
to
judge
what
is
necessary
to
be
done
be
so
good
as
to
show
me
the
way
come
after
me
matthews
grimes
was
evidently
taken
very
much
by
surprise
and
by
no
means
prepared
to
receive
the
lady
of
the
house
for
to
say
the
truth
she
had
converted
the
servants
hall
into
a
and
was
actually
engaged
in
washing
and
ironing
for
her
own
and
the
steward
family
while
her
two
nieces
and
two
country
girls
in
consequence
of
the
first
hint
of
the
shepherd
lad
were
busily
engaged
in
effacing
as
far
as
possible
the
traces
of
their
occupation
grimes
led
the
young
lady
into
the
large
hall
on
the
left
of
the
entrance
and
made
great
ado
to
open
the
windows
the
assistance
of
the
however
rendered
the
process
shorter
than
she
desired
and
lady
anne
stood
in
the
midst
gazing
round
at
the
old
pictures
upon
the
walls
the
stately
black
oak
chairs
and
the
enormous
with
its
cupids
and
columns
and
baskets
of
fruit
all
carved
in
white
marble
where
does
that
door
lead
to
demanded
lady
anne
to
the
great
my
lady
replied
grimes
with
a
low
curtsey
and
beyond
that
is
the
little
and
then
the
great
on
the
other
side
of
the
entrance
hall
are
the
library
and
the
and
the
little
library
there
is
a
small
said
lady
anne
mellent
adjoining
the
in
which
my
father
slept
when
he
was
here
do
you
know
which
that
is
oh
yes
my
lady
replied
grimes
it
the
that
has
what
we
call
the
sealed
cabinet
in
it
for
there
is
a
great
piece
of
parchment
nailed
across
the
doors
with
seals
over
the
nails
exactly
said
lady
anne
take
my
servant
with
you
open
the
windows
of
that
room
and
then
come
back
to
show
me
the
way
as
soon
as
the
woman
and
the
footman
had
retired
lady
anne
took
a
letter
from
her
pocket
and
placed
it
in
hargrave
hand
saying
very
gravely
you
have
wondered
i
dare
say
my
dear
sir
why
i
brought
you
hither
read
that
letter
which
my
poor
father
left
to
be
given
to
me
after
his
death
you
will
therein
see
that
it
may
be
needful
that
i
should
have
some
one
with
me
to
witness
the
fact
of
my
opening
this
cabinet
and
to
certify
what
are
the
contents
that
i
find
in
it
i
could
apply
to
no
one
so
well
as
to
a
magistrate
an
old
friend
of
my
father
and
my
grandfather
and
one
universally
respected
hargrave
took
the
letter
which
had
evidently
been
written
some
years
and
looked
at
the
back
which
bore
the
following
words
to
be
delivered
to
my
daughter
lady
anne
mellent
when
she
attains
the
age
of
twenty
or
previous
to
her
marriage
if
she
should
marry
before
attaining
that
age
it
is
my
wish
that
she
should
read
it
when
alone
the
old
gentleman
then
opened
it
and
read
it
near
the
window
pausing
every
now
and
then
to
consider
the
contents
and
while
he
was
doing
so
grimes
the
room
saying
the
windows
are
open
my
lady
well
wait
without
for
a
minute
or
two
said
lady
anne
and
then
turned
her
eyes
again
to
the
face
of
hargrave
who
continued
to
read
when
he
had
done
he
folded
up
the
letter
again
and
returned
it
saying
part
of
the
facts
mentioned
in
that
letter
my
dear
i
suspected
long
ago
from
various
circumstances
which
came
to
my
knowledge
but
as
i
suppose
there
is
no
chance
of
your
title
being
disputed
i
think
your
precaution
in
bringing
an
old
gentleman
with
you
was
unnecessary
i
wished
to
take
every
reasonable
precaution
replied
his
fair
companion
with
a
smile
and
as
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
dear
sir
another
person
may
be
very
much
affected
by
my
acts
i
thought
it
but
right
to
be
sure
of
what
i
was
doing
oh
ho
said
hargrave
laughing
then
i
am
afraid
i
have
no
chance
for
this
fair
hand
you
are
too
late
in
the
field
answered
lady
anne
gaily
but
come
let
us
to
the
cabinet
stay
i
must
have
pen
and
ink
first
said
hargrave
but
pen
and
ink
were
not
very
easily
procured
at
milford
castle
for
grimes
was
not
of
an
epistolary
turn
and
her
accounts
were
kept
upon
a
slate
one
of
her
nieces
however
supplied
the
deficiency
and
ascending
the
long
broad
oaken
staircase
lady
anne
and
hargrave
followed
the
housekeeper
to
a
small
adjoining
the
principal
i
would
not
be
the
man
over
whose
heart
a
feeling
of
sad
and
solemn
interest
does
not
steal
when
for
the
first
time
he
enters
a
chamber
once
tenanted
by
a
friend
departed
ay
though
long
years
may
have
passed
since
the
remembered
form
darkened
the
sunshine
on
the
floor
with
him
if
there
be
such
a
man
affections
must
be
written
in
water
or
the
heart
be
unsusceptible
of
love
such
was
not
the
case
with
lady
anne
mellent
nor
with
her
old
companion
and
they
both
paused
in
the
midst
of
the
room
and
thought
for
a
time
of
those
whom
they
could
never
see
more
the
old
man
tears
were
dried
up
but
he
saw
a
drop
gathering
in
lady
anne
eyes
and
laying
his
hand
tenderly
upon
hers
he
said
come
my
dear
and
led
her
towards
the
large
old
ebony
cabinet
which
stood
between
the
windows
across
the
two
just
above
the
lock
was
a
broad
strip
of
parchment
sealed
on
either
side
with
the
arms
of
the
earls
of
milford
and
upon
the
parchment
was
written
to
be
opened
only
by
my
milford
for
the
late
earl
though
he
died
at
harley
lodge
had
felt
when
last
he
visited
milford
that
the
sand
in
the
was
for
him
waning
fast
lady
anne
approached
the
cabinet
and
with
her
own
hand
removed
the
parchment
she
then
with
a
small
key
which
had
remained
ever
since
her
father
death
attached
to
her
opened
the
doors
while
hargrave
beckoned
up
grimes
and
the
footman
saying
come
a
little
nearer
and
bear
witness
that
i
place
my
name
upon
every
paper
found
in
this
cabinet
only
one
packet
however
was
found
therein
most
of
the
drawers
were
totally
empty
but
at
length
in
a
small
drawer
fitted
up
with
and
a
bundle
of
four
or
five
papers
was
found
which
sir
hargrave
untied
and
without
looking
at
the
contents
of
any
placed
his
signature
upon
each
document
certifying
that
it
had
been
found
by
lady
anne
mellent
in
his
presence
in
a
certain
cabinet
referred
to
in
a
letter
from
frederick
earl
of
milford
in
her
possession
and
that
the
cabinet
had
not
been
previously
opened
since
it
had
been
sealed
by
the
late
earl
this
being
completed
lady
anne
begged
her
old
companion
to
keep
possession
of
the
papers
at
least
till
they
arrived
at
the
inn
and
then
once
more
closing
the
cabinet
she
left
the
room
her
spirits
seemed
to
rise
now
that
the
task
was
over
and
she
went
on
gaily
and
lightly
from
chamber
to
chamber
causing
all
the
windows
to
be
thrown
wide
open
commenting
upon
everything
she
saw
and
asking
a
multitude
of
questions
to
all
of
which
grimes
had
not
very
satisfactory
answers
ready
when
she
had
gone
over
the
whole
house
somewhat
to
the
amusement
and
somewhat
to
the
fatigue
of
good
hargrave
she
sat
herself
down
in
one
of
the
great
armchairs
which
stood
in
the
principal
and
exclaimed
laughingly
now
like
alexander
selkirk
am
monarch
of
all
i
survey
but
like
him
too
my
dear
sir
i
lack
subjects
sadly
send
some
one
for
the
steward
grimes
and
to
guard
against
all
the
many
contingencies
some
of
which
are
always
happening
in
the
country
if
the
steward
should
not
be
at
home
let
his
son
come
up
if
he
has
no
son
or
his
son
be
out
let
his
wife
come
if
no
wife
or
son
be
found
let
a
daughter
a
nephew
a
niece
an
uncle
a
cousin
or
some
relation
of
some
kind
and
especially
let
each
all
or
every
of
them
come
directly
for
i
have
an
infinity
of
orders
to
give
the
spirit
of
hurry
is
upon
me
and
let
the
whole
inhabitants
of
the
manor
and
all
their
horses
work
as
hard
as
they
will
they
will
have
great
difficulty
in
doing
what
i
intend
to
have
done
within
the
time
i
shall
allow
now
my
dear
grimes
do
stand
and
stare
but
send
for
the
steward
as
i
tell
you
you
matthews
go
and
see
what
is
wanting
as
far
as
you
can
judge
in
the
butler
cook
and
housekeeper
departments
i
know
there
is
plenty
of
wine
in
the
cellar
and
i
can
see
from
the
window
that
there
is
mutton
at
the
door
these
last
words
were
addressed
to
hargrave
with
a
slightly
sarcastic
smile
and
she
then
added
laughing
i
intend
to
sleep
here
night
with
all
my
household
hargrave
shook
his
head
saying
i
scarcely
think
you
will
find
that
possible
considering
that
not
a
single
bed
in
the
whole
house
has
been
slept
in
for
many
years
do
you
pretend
to
believe
sir
asked
lady
anne
gravely
that
anything
is
impossible
when
a
lady
wills
it
let
me
tell
you
it
shall
be
done
i
will
make
the
gamekeepers
into
the
shepherds
into
scullions
the
steward
into
an
upholsterer
and
the
labourers
of
the
land
into
and
housekeepers
do
you
suppose
that
i
who
never
was
contradicted
in
my
life
will
be
so
on
my
first
visit
to
my
own
castle
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
dear
hargrave
i
trust
more
to
a
whole
regiment
of
servants
of
mine
who
are
coming
down
from
london
and
to
two
tumbrels
of
london
ammunition
than
to
all
the
auxiliaries
of
northumberland
thus
she
gaily
went
on
till
the
steward
appeared
in
haste
with
that
look
which
a
man
puts
on
when
he
is
suddenly
brought
into
the
presence
of
authority
which
may
demand
an
account
not
very
easy
to
be
rendered
he
bowed
low
to
lady
anne
and
even
lower
to
hargrave
but
lady
anne
attacked
him
at
once
about
the
sheep
whose
sheep
are
those
mr
blunt
she
demanded
and
how
came
they
to
be
where
they
are
why
you
see
my
lady
said
the
steward
evading
the
real
point
of
her
question
the
rest
of
the
park
is
reserved
for
the
deer
and
i
thought
your
ladyship
would
not
like
it
to
be
meddled
with
but
lady
anne
was
not
to
be
put
off
and
she
demanded
but
how
come
they
to
be
in
the
park
at
all
blunt
i
thought
the
whole
of
the
park
was
reserved
for
deer
why
so
it
used
to
be
my
lady
answered
the
steward
but
you
see
my
lady
i
just
thought
it
would
be
clean
waste
of
good
feed
not
to
have
a
few
sheep
in
and
how
long
has
this
been
carried
on
demanded
lady
anne
why
i
ca
just
say
my
lady
replied
the
steward
not
having
the
books
handy
and
to
whom
do
they
belong
demanded
lady
anne
why
for
that
matter
they
may
be
your
ladyship
if
you
like
said
the
steward
they
are
not
that
dear
of
the
money
lady
anne
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
at
the
pertinacious
evasions
so
gay
so
so
that
joined
with
the
shrewd
glance
of
her
eye
it
quite
upset
good
hargrave
gravity
and
utterly
confounded
the
steward
who
clearly
perceived
with
no
very
pleasant
feeling
that
she
saw
through
him
to
the
very
backbone
waving
her
hand
to
stop
any
further
explanations
she
said
very
well
blunt
very
well
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
that
they
are
very
excellent
sheep
and
that
you
have
very
excellent
reasons
for
everything
but
i
think
they
are
out
of
place
in
my
park
and
therefore
i
must
beg
that
you
will
have
every
one
of
them
removed
before
noon
the
whole
of
the
fences
which
you
have
planted
taken
away
and
every
vestige
removed
which
your
woolly
tenants
may
have
left
behind
the
ground
must
also
be
rolled
with
a
large
roller
i
should
desire
also
to
have
the
from
the
side
both
of
belford
and
wooler
rolled
likewise
the
branches
which
overhang
the
road
trimmed
away
to
the
full
height
of
the
top
of
a
carriage
and
some
gravel
put
down
in
those
deep
ruts
at
the
bottom
of
the
valleys
between
this
and
the
great
gates
moreover
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
send
up
all
the
poultry
eggs
and
butter
which
are
available
and
direct
the
gamekeepers
to
bring
up
all
the
trout
they
can
catch
they
must
also
shoot
a
buck
and
see
for
a
leveret
or
two
of
course
the
is
well
stocked
as
the
farm
makes
such
a
large
item
in
the
accounts
all
that
i
have
mentioned
must
be
done
before
night
as
i
am
about
to
take
up
my
residence
here
and
expect
friends
during
that
evening
or
the
morning
after
who
will
stay
with
me
for
some
days
the
park
paling
on
each
side
of
the
gate
too
must
be
mended
and
a
new
lock
put
upon
the
gates
themselves
heaven
preserve
us
my
lady
exclaimed
blunt
it
will
be
quite
impossible
to
get
all
this
done
before
night
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
it
replied
lady
anne
for
it
must
be
done
and
somebody
must
be
found
to
do
it
so
if
you
can
not
accomplish
it
i
must
oh
i
did
say
i
could
accomplish
it
my
lady
only
it
be
desperate
hard
work
and
there
is
hardly
time
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
that
too
replied
lady
anne
for
there
will
be
at
least
forty
other
things
for
you
to
do
in
the
course
of
the
morning
and
they
must
all
be
done
too
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
collect
all
the
workpeople
in
my
employment
here
at
the
castle
by
one
i
have
a
note
of
how
many
they
consist
of
and
moreover
i
should
like
to
have
all
the
active
men
in
the
neighbourhood
of
whatever
professions
they
may
be
here
at
the
castle
to
help
the
others
that
is
all
for
the
present
i
will
give
further
directions
stay
blunt
you
have
of
course
at
the
farm
and
young
ducks
but
no
had
blunt
and
young
ducks
according
to
his
account
were
never
to
be
had
in
that
part
of
northumberland
before
somebody
fair
the
name
of
which
he
mentioned
but
i
forget
lady
anne
shook
her
head
must
be
found
she
said
and
you
must
make
some
young
ducks
if
you
have
got
them
plovers
eggs
of
course
you
have
plenty
of
plovers
eggs
blunt
looked
aghast
but
he
did
not
like
absolutely
to
deny
the
fact
and
therefore
replied
they
have
some
over
at
wooler
my
lady
but
they
do
come
down
here
then
send
over
to
wooler
for
all
they
have
got
said
lady
anne
and
with
these
orders
she
dismissed
him
now
grimes
she
said
turning
to
that
good
lady
who
had
been
standing
by
in
a
state
of
great
consternation
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
leave
all
the
windows
open
till
sunset
to
spread
out
all
the
beds
upon
the
floors
of
the
rooms
to
brush
the
dust
off
all
these
hangings
chairs
and
pictures
to
have
all
that
green
removed
from
the
steps
to
make
the
cobwebs
disappear
in
different
directions
to
have
large
fires
lighted
in
every
and
in
the
principal
and
to
let
me
see
the
house
in
complete
order
when
i
arrive
now
hargrave
she
continued
i
have
tired
out
your
patience
let
us
drive
back
to
belford
and
you
matthews
stay
here
and
see
that
all
is
done
as
i
have
directed
you
know
what
i
want
yes
my
lady
replied
the
man
and
hurrying
forward
he
opened
the
door
of
the
carriage
as
soon
as
she
and
her
old
companion
were
seated
lady
anne
leaned
back
on
the
cushions
and
laughed
i
have
given
them
enough
to
do
i
think
she
said
am
not
i
an
excellent
housekeeper
and
woman
of
business
hargrave
i
was
only
afraid
of
making
some
mistake
and
asking
for
some
bird
or
beast
in
june
that
does
not
come
to
england
till
november
i
am
afraid
said
hargrave
that
they
will
never
be
able
to
fulfil
all
your
orders
in
the
time
but
to
give
them
was
a
very
fair
punishment
for
the
neglect
perhaps
i
might
use
a
stronger
word
which
they
have
shown
it
is
the
only
punishment
i
shall
ever
inflict
replied
lady
anne
for
as
you
say
if
masters
and
mistresses
choose
to
neglect
their
own
affairs
how
can
they
expect
that
others
will
take
care
of
them
but
now
listen
for
i
have
got
a
long
story
to
tell
you
which
with
all
the
questions
you
intend
to
ask
and
all
the
answers
i
intend
to
give
will
just
occupy
one
hour
and
a
half
and
by
that
time
we
shall
be
at
belford
chapter
xxx
in
the
mean
time
it
is
curious
to
begin
a
new
chapter
with
such
words
as
in
the
mean
time
but
yet
dear
reader
they
are
the
most
comprehensive
and
nearly
the
most
important
in
any
language
they
comprise
the
present
infinity
all
except
one
small
point
and
even
that
they
affect
in
all
its
consequences
the
man
who
is
an
actor
in
the
great
world
drama
performs
his
solitary
deed
but
all
the
results
of
that
deed
are
modified
by
what
is
doing
the
mean
the
man
who
is
a
recorder
of
other
men
actions
chronicles
what
is
done
by
one
or
another
but
still
to
judge
even
in
the
least
of
the
essence
and
the
bearings
and
the
consequences
of
the
deeds
recorded
we
must
ask
what
was
doing
the
mean
time
a
stone
rolled
out
of
its
place
a
casual
and
thoughtless
jest
the
sport
of
a
child
a
grain
of
sand
wafted
by
the
wind
the
mean
may
overset
all
that
we
are
labouring
to
perform
frustrate
our
best
devised
schemes
render
fruitless
our
most
skilfully
performed
actions
do
you
doubt
it
reader
listen
then
i
will
take
one
of
the
assertions
i
have
made
and
work
it
out
there
was
a
rich
merchant
who
had
an
only
daughter
he
laboured
for
twenty
years
to
make
her
a
great
heiress
his
hopes
and
his
happiness
were
all
built
upon
her
his
efforts
were
all
for
her
nor
were
they
unwisely
directed
he
cultivated
her
mind
he
improved
her
understanding
he
enlarged
her
heart
he
looked
round
for
some
one
who
was
to
make
the
happiness
of
her
who
was
his
happiness
he
was
difficult
in
his
choice
careful
in
his
examination
scrupulous
in
his
judgment
with
rare
good
fortune
he
found
what
he
sought
a
man
noble
but
not
proud
good
but
not
rigid
gentle
but
not
weak
one
moreover
who
sought
her
for
herself
not
for
her
wealth
and
to
crown
all
one
whom
she
could
love
the
merchant
was
very
happy
no
difficulties
arose
the
was
appointed
the
settlements
were
drawn
up
and
he
and
the
bridegroom
went
to
read
them
over
together
they
were
all
that
either
desired
and
the
father
shook
hands
with
his
future
expressing
his
perfect
satisfaction
the
mean
at
the
very
moment
when
their
hands
were
clasped
in
each
other
a
little
boy
of
eight
years
old
an
orphan
nephew
of
the
merchant
lighted
a
piece
of
paper
at
the
fire
in
the
the
paper
burnt
his
fingers
and
he
let
it
fall
it
dropped
upon
his
clothes
they
caught
fire
and
he
screamed
his
cries
brought
his
fair
cousin
rushing
from
the
adjoining
room
she
caught
him
in
her
arms
endeavouring
to
stifle
the
flame
her
own
apparel
took
fire
and
before
night
the
merchant
was
childless
let
no
man
ever
calculate
upon
success
for
he
never
can
tell
what
is
doing
the
mean
in
the
mean
time
while
lady
anne
mellent
was
acting
as
we
have
seen
in
the
most
remote
part
of
northumberland
two
series
of
operations
were
going
forward
in
london
with
which
it
is
necessary
the
reader
should
be
acquainted
but
like
the
animal
between
the
two
bundles
of
hay
i
am
sorely
puzzled
which
to
go
on
with
first
we
left
lady
fleetwood
just
ready
to
go
out
after
having
dismissed
mingy
bowes
we
left
mingy
bowes
just
entering
the
room
where
carlo
carlini
and
the
pedlar
sat
with
a
look
of
surprise
upon
his
countenance
which
would
the
reader
like
to
go
on
with
let
us
toss
up
if
the
luck
should
be
against
the
reader
inclination
he
has
nothing
to
do
but
invert
the
order
of
this
and
the
following
chapter
now
then
heads
or
tails
lady
fleetwood
wins
the
day
after
mingy
bowes
had
taken
his
departure
the
excellent
lady
sat
for
a
moment
or
two
to
recover
breath
and
composure
for
both
were
in
a
somewhat
exhausted
state
at
the
end
of
her
conversation
with
the
respectable
person
who
had
just
left
her
she
then
rose
rang
the
bell
and
walked
out
taking
her
way
direct
towards
the
house
of
scriven
as
she
went
indeed
she
became
a
good
deal
agitated
she
had
previously
made
up
her
mind
to
act
most
diplomatically
with
her
brother
had
arranged
all
her
plans
was
fully
convinced
that
she
comprehended
every
particular
of
maria
situation
and
saw
through
all
her
secrets
but
her
conversation
with
mingy
bowes
had
shaken
and
confused
all
her
thoughts
views
and
purposes
so
that
she
could
lay
her
hand
upon
nothing
and
when
she
did
find
the
skein
of
thought
it
was
so
tangled
and
twisted
that
she
could
not
unravel
it
for
the
life
of
her
in
these
circumstances
it
would
have
been
only
wise
to
have
gone
back
quietly
to
her
own
house
and
left
matters
exactly
as
they
were
without
meddling
with
them
at
all
but
as
i
have
shown
the
demon
of
activity
was
upon
her
and
spurred
her
on
to
help
her
friends
and
relations
against
their
will
so
forward
she
was
carried
upon
her
way
by
the
power
of
the
locomotive
within
till
she
reached
scriven
door
and
john
rapped
loud
and
strong
then
indeed
she
would
have
given
her
ears
to
have
got
away
or
to
have
found
that
her
brother
was
out
no
such
good
fortune
awaited
her
the
door
was
opened
almost
immediately
scriven
was
at
home
and
she
was
shown
up
to
his
he
had
got
three
printed
papers
before
him
the
london
gazette
the
shipping
list
and
another
i
do
know
what
besides
a
little
scrap
of
white
paper
not
bigger
than
my
hand
for
scriven
was
very
careful
of
his
paper
on
which
he
was
jotting
down
various
cabalistic
signs
and
a
number
of
figures
which
nobody
in
europe
could
have
made
anything
of
but
himself
the
result
did
not
seem
satisfactory
to
him
however
for
his
face
was
certainly
gloomy
and
pointing
with
the
of
his
pencil
to
a
chair
he
uttered
the
laconic
and
incomplete
sentence
in
a
minute
and
then
went
on
with
his
calculations
again
lady
fleetwood
sat
down
and
perhaps
no
worse
mode
of
torture
could
have
been
devised
by
scriven
than
that
of
making
her
wait
in
silence
for
she
did
not
employ
the
interval
calmly
and
orderly
in
thinking
what
she
had
best
do
but
suffered
and
and
the
recollections
of
everything
that
had
taken
place
between
maria
and
herself
and
bowes
and
herself
and
all
the
deductions
she
had
formerly
drawn
and
all
the
doubts
which
had
since
sprung
up
and
a
great
many
other
considerations
besides
to
settle
down
upon
her
like
a
swarm
of
bees
and
sting
her
till
she
was
half
mad
with
the
irritation
her
mind
was
in
a
very
swollen
and
inflamed
state
when
scriven
stopped
folded
up
the
paper
and
put
it
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
drew
in
the
nose
of
his
pencil
like
the
head
of
a
tortoise
into
its
shell
and
then
looking
straight
at
lady
fleetwood
said
well
margaret
what
do
you
want
i
could
not
come
at
eleven
for
as
you
see
i
had
something
else
to
do
but
i
suppose
your
business
is
important
or
you
would
not
hunt
me
down
here
his
uncivil
speech
gave
lady
fleetwood
an
opportunity
of
escape
if
she
had
had
wit
enough
to
avail
herself
of
it
and
indeed
she
did
make
an
effort
though
it
was
not
a
very
successful
one
oh
i
do
want
to
disturb
you
at
all
she
said
i
did
not
know
you
were
particularly
engaged
had
she
stopped
there
it
would
have
been
all
very
well
for
her
brother
in
his
dry
unpleasant
way
was
just
about
to
say
that
he
particularly
engaged
and
the
matter
might
have
dropped
but
lady
fleetwood
was
a
terrible
person
for
standing
upon
the
defensive
she
did
not
at
all
like
the
very
insinuation
of
trifling
and
she
added
unluckily
of
course
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
important
or
i
should
not
have
asked
you
to
come
and
should
not
have
come
here
well
what
is
it
asked
scriven
i
suppose
you
have
got
into
some
important
scrape
and
want
me
to
get
you
out
of
it
not
at
all
answered
lady
fleetwood
with
an
indignant
air
i
wished
merely
to
speak
with
you
not
about
myself
but
about
maria
and
colonel
middleton
oh
said
scriven
not
well
pleased
at
the
collocation
of
his
niece
name
with
that
of
an
object
of
antipathy
pray
what
has
maria
to
do
with
colonel
middleton
or
colonel
middleton
with
maria
now
his
bitter
sneering
way
at
times
roused
even
lady
fleetwood
into
something
like
resistance
but
unfortunately
scriven
knew
that
such
was
the
case
and
knew
that
in
her
fits
of
indignation
his
sister
would
tell
him
all
he
wanted
to
hear
more
plainly
straightforwardly
and
concisely
than
she
would
under
any
other
circumstances
that
she
was
thrown
off
her
guard
in
short
he
therefore
occasionally
irritated
her
upon
calculation
for
scriven
was
a
great
calculator
in
the
present
instance
the
way
in
which
he
put
the
question
more
than
the
question
itself
induced
her
to
reply
now
my
dear
brother
if
you
inclined
to
hear
patiently
and
act
reasonably
i
will
go
on
for
i
came
here
with
the
purpose
of
persuading
you
not
to
struggle
against
what
you
can
not
resist
but
to
let
maria
seek
her
own
happiness
in
her
own
now
my
dear
sister
answered
scriven
in
a
somewhat
mocking
tone
i
am
inclined
to
hear
patiently
if
the
story
is
told
briefly
and
to
act
reasonably
however
it
is
told
for
i
think
you
ought
to
know
that
i
always
act
upon
reason
and
that
reason
is
my
sole
guide
thank
god
i
have
neither
imagination
nor
caprice
nor
fine
feelings
nor
delicate
sentiments
nor
any
of
the
trash
with
which
your
very
tender
and
extremely
sensitive
people
befool
themselves
reason
is
the
only
guide
i
ever
applied
to
and
i
do
think
she
is
likely
to
leave
me
now
as
to
letting
maria
seek
her
own
happiness
in
her
own
way
i
have
no
means
of
preventing
her
if
she
is
going
to
make
a
fool
of
herself
i
shall
tell
her
so
and
having
told
her
once
i
have
done
my
duty
and
there
the
matter
ends
she
is
of
age
she
can
do
what
she
pleases
and
i
have
only
to
do
the
best
that
i
can
to
prevent
anything
she
does
from
affecting
her
more
injuriously
than
it
otherwise
might
now
then
our
ground
is
clear
what
the
matter
lady
fleetwood
hesitated
but
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
why
she
said
and
be
it
remarked
that
whenever
woman
makes
use
of
the
little
word
why
as
an
expletive
she
knows
she
is
coming
on
difficult
ground
why
i
can
not
help
seeing
that
is
to
say
fancying
that
is
to
say
believing
that
maria
has
a
partiality
for
colonel
middleton
said
lady
fleetwood
and
during
her
stammering
enunciation
of
this
proposition
scriven
sat
provokingly
silent
and
quiet
he
did
not
help
her
even
by
a
look
what
makes
you
think
so
he
inquired
laconically
oh
many
things
answered
his
sister
taking
courage
a
little
many
things
rejoined
scriven
that
is
the
refuge
of
the
destitute
let
me
hear
one
or
two
of
these
things
why
you
know
my
dear
brother
one
judges
from
what
one
sees
said
lady
fleetwood
women
eyes
are
sharp
in
such
matters
scriven
was
tempted
to
condemn
women
eyes
in
the
vernacular
but
he
never
swore
or
used
imprecations
of
any
kind
and
therefore
he
asked
simply
but
what
have
the
sharp
eyes
seen
i
have
seen
them
talking
together
you
know
and
all
that
answered
his
sister
so
have
i
answered
the
merchant
and
i
have
seen
her
and
young
men
talking
and
all
that
well
but
then
her
looks
and
her
manner
said
lady
fleetwood
driven
to
the
wall
and
besides
i
have
had
some
conversation
with
her
upon
the
subject
and
she
told
you
that
she
intended
to
marry
him
demanded
scriven
is
not
that
the
plain
truth
no
she
did
not
in
so
many
words
say
that
was
the
reply
but
she
did
not
deny
it
certainly
scriven
got
up
and
walked
across
the
room
three
or
four
times
not
fast
be
it
remarked
not
with
the
slightest
agitation
of
word
look
or
manner
but
calmly
considerately
as
if
he
were
thinking
of
the
royal
exchange
he
asked
himself
if
that
was
all
his
sister
had
come
to
tell
him
if
it
was
likely
she
should
come
upon
such
an
errand
but
he
knew
her
well
and
was
not
unaware
of
her
peculiar
talent
for
increasing
difficulties
by
trying
to
smooth
them
away
he
saw
it
was
likely
in
her
though
unlikely
in
any
one
else
well
i
suppose
before
she
does
such
a
thing
he
replied
at
length
we
shall
hear
something
more
of
this
colonel
middleton
he
is
wonderfully
like
henry
hayley
but
the
evidence
of
everything
but
one
own
senses
is
the
other
way
and
if
he
were
henry
hayley
my
dear
brother
said
lady
fleetwood
wonderfully
revived
and
encouraged
by
the
progress
which
from
his
calm
tone
she
had
made
i
am
quite
sure
you
would
not
be
disposed
to
persecute
the
young
man
i
for
one
feel
quite
sure
he
did
not
commit
the
forgery
if
it
was
any
one
it
was
his
father
for
henry
could
have
no
need
for
such
a
sum
of
money
and
we
all
know
poor
hayley
had
for
you
told
me
yourself
that
he
was
given
to
gambling
a
new
light
broke
upon
scriven
his
sister
did
know
more
than
she
had
said
there
was
a
secret
trembling
on
her
lips
he
saw
that
or
at
least
imagined
it
and
he
knew
that
to
frighten
her
would
drive
it
back
again
at
once
his
course
was
determined
in
a
moment
very
true
he
said
thoughtfully
that
never
struck
me
before
hayley
was
capable
of
anything
he
was
a
notorious
gambler
what
you
say
is
very
likely
margaret
and
if
that
be
the
case
far
from
persecuting
the
young
gentleman
i
would
but
no
matter
for
that
persecuting
is
quite
out
of
the
question
the
matter
has
been
over
so
many
years
you
know
that
it
may
almost
be
said
to
be
forgotten
however
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
business
for
as
i
said
just
now
though
very
like
poor
henry
hayley
it
is
evident
that
colonel
middleton
can
not
be
the
same
person
all
the
proofs
are
against
it
and
you
and
i
must
have
committed
a
blunder
in
thinking
so
even
for
a
moment
i
do
know
that
said
lady
fleetwood
with
a
very
sagacious
air
i
have
still
my
doubts
brother
pooh
pooh
cried
scriven
i
made
inquiries
of
the
young
count
and
countess
it
can
not
be
you
are
quite
mistaken
depend
upon
it
do
not
be
too
sure
replied
his
sister
something
very
strange
happened
to
me
this
very
day
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
some
bad
people
have
got
hold
of
the
secret
and
intend
to
extract
money
from
the
poor
young
man
now
i
know
that
if
you
did
discover
it
you
would
never
make
use
of
it
for
any
bad
purpose
and
she
looked
up
in
her
brother
face
with
the
most
appealing
look
in
the
world
most
assuredly
i
would
not
replied
scriven
solemnly
and
he
meant
it
too
for
to
have
hanged
henry
hayley
he
would
have
looked
upon
as
a
highly
meritorious
act
but
what
is
this
that
has
happened
to
you
margaret
i
am
afraid
you
are
making
one
of
your
mistakes
the
words
one
of
your
mistakes
were
very
galling
and
lady
fleetwood
hastened
to
prove
that
she
was
making
no
mistake
at
all
by
telling
her
brother
all
that
had
taken
place
between
her
and
mingy
bowes
scriven
listened
with
profound
attention
but
his
mind
was
carrying
on
two
processes
at
once
he
was
weighing
every
syllable
his
sister
uttered
to
judge
whether
her
tale
could
leave
any
doubt
whatever
of
the
identity
of
colonel
middleton
with
henry
hayley
and
he
was
arranging
and
preparing
his
own
plan
of
action
to
be
ready
to
reply
accordingly
when
she
had
done
long
before
her
story
was
concluded
scriven
had
made
up
his
mind
not
a
doubt
remained
henry
hayley
was
alive
in
england
within
his
grasp
and
that
grasp
was
a
fell
one
which
did
not
easily
let
go
but
although
he
had
now
extracted
all
he
wanted
from
lady
fleetwood
yet
he
had
a
strong
conviction
that
she
was
even
more
likely
to
spoil
his
schemes
than
those
of
any
other
person
if
he
allowed
her
to
get
the
least
glimpse
of
his
game
and
therefore
he
replied
indeed
margaret
this
seems
something
like
the
truth
and
now
we
must
think
what
can
best
be
done
under
such
dangerous
and
difficult
circumstances
i
would
not
if
i
were
you
say
a
word
to
the
poor
young
man
of
what
i
had
discovered
it
would
only
alarm
him
to
no
purpose
nor
indeed
would
i
have
any
more
dealings
with
that
rascal
who
called
ladies
are
not
fit
to
meet
such
men
and
indeed
it
is
dangerous
oh
i
told
him
to
come
at
twelve
the
day
after
on
purpose
replied
lady
fleetwood
because
then
i
and
maria
will
both
be
gone
into
the
north
to
this
party
of
lady
anne
so
he
will
find
no
one
but
old
hickson
and
the
maids
as
to
telling
colonel
middleton
i
shall
not
have
any
opportunity
for
three
or
four
days
he
is
going
down
too
but
you
see
it
would
not
of
course
be
proper
for
maria
and
him
to
travel
together
so
we
shall
first
meet
at
milford
castle
very
improper
indeed
said
scriven
musing
pray
margaret
where
is
this
man
to
be
found
who
called
upon
you
this
morning
dear
me
how
should
i
know
replied
lady
fleetwood
of
course
i
did
not
ask
him
i
do
not
see
the
said
her
dry
brother
and
indeed
it
would
have
been
much
better
to
ask
him
for
you
see
it
is
in
some
degree
endangering
your
young
friend
however
i
will
be
at
your
house
when
the
man
comes
the
day
after
will
see
him
and
settle
all
with
him
so
as
to
ensure
that
nothing
goes
amiss
now
lady
fleetwood
knew
her
brother
to
be
very
clever
at
settling
all
matters
of
business
but
in
this
case
mingy
bowes
had
specifically
demanded
the
sum
of
one
thousand
pounds
and
it
was
not
within
possibility
for
any
one
who
knew
scriven
well
to
believe
that
he
would
pay
a
thousand
pounds
on
any
account
if
he
could
help
it
she
therefore
said
in
a
somewhat
timid
tone
but
the
money
my
dear
brother
what
is
to
be
done
about
the
money
which
these
men
demand
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
got
without
telling
colonel
middleton
what
they
say
leave
it
all
to
me
said
scriven
somewhat
impatiently
do
not
say
a
word
to
colonel
middleton
for
it
would
only
fill
him
and
maria
too
with
anxiety
and
it
is
very
likely
after
all
that
no
money
will
be
needed
the
very
act
of
attempting
to
extort
money
by
threats
of
accusation
is
punishable
by
transportation
and
the
good
gentlemen
will
not
like
the
prospect
of
that
when
it
is
clearly
stated
to
them
leave
it
to
me
margaret
i
say
and
now
i
must
go
to
the
city
lady
fleetwood
in
accordance
with
this
last
hint
left
him
and
bent
her
steps
back
towards
her
own
house
at
first
she
walked
joyously
and
well
satisfied
as
if
she
had
performed
a
great
feat
but
gradually
as
a
doubt
stole
in
as
to
whether
her
brother
was
the
best
person
to
whom
she
could
have
revealed
secrets
affecting
henry
hayley
her
began
to
sink
considerably
and
she
asked
herself
what
use
might
scriven
make
of
the
information
if
he
chose
it
is
one
of
the
unpleasant
consequences
of
such
a
character
as
scriven
that
even
those
who
from
the
ties
of
blood
or
old
intimacy
feel
that
sort
of
negative
regard
which
springs
less
from
esteem
and
affection
than
from
mere
habit
always
rely
on
them
imperfectly
the
indiscreet
in
their
paroxysms
of
loquacity
may
give
them
their
secrets
the
timid
in
order
to
disarm
their
opposition
or
win
their
assistance
may
furnish
them
with
dangerous
information
but
both
as
soon
as
it
is
done
doubt
the
prudence
of
the
act
and
wait
in
trembling
uncertainty
for
the
result
it
occurs
also
nine
times
out
of
ten
with
persons
of
the
disposition
and
character
of
lady
fleetwood
that
they
are
discreet
at
the
wrong
moment
the
angel
visits
of
discretion
come
at
times
when
they
are
unserviceable
and
so
poor
lady
fleetwood
found
it
she
had
told
her
brother
what
she
had
better
have
left
untold
but
after
having
done
so
she
did
not
dare
inform
more
trustworthy
people
of
the
fact
lest
she
should
draw
down
blame
upon
her
own
indiscretion
and
she
resolved
to
let
things
take
their
course
especially
as
maria
and
colonel
middleton
would
both
be
at
a
distance
from
london
so
that
some
time
must
pass
before
they
heard
indirectly
of
what
she
had
thought
fit
to
do
indeed
she
rather
hurried
all
the
preparations
for
their
departure
from
london
for
fear
anything
should
force
an
explanation
before
they
went
and
very
glad
she
was
when
she
and
her
niece
safely
packed
up
in
the
carriage
had
passed
the
first
turnpike
on
the
great
north
road
chapter
xxxi
it
one
could
really
be
a
spectator
a
mere
spectator
of
what
is
passing
in
the
world
around
us
without
taking
part
in
the
events
or
sharing
in
the
passions
and
the
actual
performance
on
the
stage
if
we
could
sit
ourselves
down
as
it
were
in
a
private
box
of
the
great
theatre
and
quietly
look
on
at
the
piece
which
is
playing
no
more
moved
than
is
absolutely
implied
by
sympathy
with
our
what
a
curious
what
an
amusing
what
an
interesting
spectacle
would
life
present
but
we
never
in
this
fashion
see
the
whole
of
the
play
sooner
or
later
we
jump
up
on
the
stage
and
take
a
part
in
the
acting
and
are
inclined
all
throughout
to
do
so
like
a
child
or
a
savage
or
don
quixote
at
the
from
time
to
time
indeed
we
do
see
a
detached
scene
or
two
as
spectators
and
then
most
exceedingly
entertaining
it
is
such
was
the
case
with
carlo
carlini
as
he
sat
reclining
with
dignified
ease
in
an
leathern
chair
with
a
long
comfortable
sloping
back
looking
alternately
at
the
two
faces
of
joshua
brown
the
pedlar
and
mingy
bowes
when
they
met
so
unexpectedly
to
the
latter
carlini
as
the
reader
is
aware
was
totally
unacquainted
with
the
peculiar
circumstances
in
which
the
two
now
encountered
each
other
and
therefore
the
expression
of
their
countenances
had
all
the
advantage
of
mystery
joshua
brown
sat
gazing
upon
the
with
a
look
of
old
roman
sternness
which
was
not
lost
upon
bowes
the
expression
of
the
latter
was
full
of
surprise
joined
with
a
considerable
portion
of
apprehension
for
his
first
idea
was
that
the
pedlar
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
handing
him
over
to
a
and
bearing
testimony
against
him
now
knowing
himself
assailable
upon
many
points
bowes
was
by
no
means
fond
of
the
investigations
at
which
are
sometimes
carried
a
good
deal
farther
than
is
either
agreeable
or
convenient
to
persons
of
his
profession
the
first
effect
therefore
of
the
apparition
of
the
pedlar
was
surprise
the
second
was
fear
but
surprise
was
of
course
over
in
an
instant
being
the
most
evanescent
of
all
things
and
fear
was
soon
banished
likewise
by
reliance
on
his
own
skill
and
on
the
arms
which
he
believed
were
in
his
hands
good
evening
bowes
said
the
pedlar
who
was
the
first
to
speak
i
did
not
expect
to
meet
you
here
when
i
came
in
just
now
do
you
think
it
may
be
a
little
dangerous
both
for
you
and
for
your
friend
sam
to
show
yourselves
in
london
so
soon
after
what
took
place
down
near
frimley
i
do
know
why
it
should
said
mingy
bowes
with
the
most
innocent
air
in
the
world
i
have
only
come
to
speak
to
the
colonel
upon
the
little
business
you
know
of
what
colonel
demanded
joshua
brown
speaking
civilly
and
motioning
bowes
to
a
seat
for
it
was
his
object
to
make
the
fence
as
he
was
called
say
all
he
had
to
say
and
lay
open
his
game
as
far
as
his
discretion
would
permit
him
they
were
both
men
of
the
world
however
and
master
mingy
having
had
a
great
deal
of
very
delicate
work
to
do
in
his
lifetime
was
not
a
little
cautious
he
thought
indeed
that
there
could
be
no
great
harm
in
answering
the
question
as
nakedly
as
it
was
put
and
he
consequently
replied
why
colonel
middleton
to
be
sure
oh
colonel
middleton
said
the
pedlar
i
suppose
i
have
no
business
to
ask
what
you
want
with
colonel
middleton
i
should
think
not
said
mingy
bowes
well
at
all
events
colonel
middleton
is
out
said
carlini
he
wo
be
home
from
the
country
till
it
is
late
and
as
soon
as
he
does
come
home
he
going
out
again
ha
said
bowes
who
was
fast
getting
over
his
apprehensions
nevertheless
i
must
have
a
word
or
two
with
him
sir
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
you
find
that
difficult
replied
carlini
unless
you
tell
me
what
your
business
is
for
he
will
not
see
any
one
whom
he
does
not
know
without
inquiring
what
he
wants
then
he
may
find
he
got
into
the
wrong
box
said
the
fence
in
rather
a
menacing
tone
said
carlini
what
does
he
mean
by
he
means
what
he
does
not
understand
himself
said
the
pedlar
leaning
his
two
hands
upon
the
table
and
slowly
and
deliberately
rising
from
his
seat
as
if
he
were
somewhat
stiff
and
weary
he
then
took
a
step
or
two
towards
the
door
with
a
heavy
unconcerned
air
mingy
bowes
did
not
at
first
remark
the
proceeding
but
as
joshua
brown
got
between
him
and
the
way
out
he
felt
a
little
nervous
which
nervousness
was
greatly
increased
when
he
saw
the
pedlar
put
his
hand
upon
the
key
in
the
lock
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
exclaimed
starting
up
i
do
choose
to
be
locked
in
sit
down
bowes
said
joshua
brown
in
a
tone
very
quiet
but
very
stern
and
at
the
same
moment
he
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
drew
it
out
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
he
then
walked
back
to
his
seat
in
the
same
sort
of
stiff
heavy
manner
there
was
something
very
impressive
in
that
sort
of
and
bowes
sat
himself
down
again
and
began
playing
with
the
buttons
at
the
knees
of
his
drab
breeches
apparently
to
pass
the
time
while
waiting
for
an
explanation
before
he
gave
one
however
joshua
brown
poured
himself
out
of
wine
and
took
a
sip
or
two
without
the
least
hurry
in
the
world
but
at
length
he
said
now
mingy
bowes
i
dare
say
you
want
to
hear
why
i
have
locked
the
door
it
only
because
i
got
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
you
which
might
perhaps
make
you
bolt
before
you
had
heard
the
whole
and
that
would
not
suit
me
you
a
dealer
in
marine
stores
i
take
it
well
i
know
that
said
mingy
bowes
all
the
world
knows
that
good
said
joshua
brown
and
you
keep
a
thieves
bank
and
receive
stolen
goods
and
run
a
little
tobacco
and
come
and
go
between
gentlemen
the
lay
and
those
who
take
the
goods
up
to
london
there
do
interrupt
me
for
all
the
world
knows
that
too
many
a
gold
thimble
and
many
a
silver
one
too
you
helped
off
the
shelf
in
your
day
that
i
know
as
well
as
you
and
can
prove
it
too
when
i
like
but
there
one
thing
i
desire
very
much
to
hear
that
to
say
what
is
just
now
behind
that
long
iron
door
in
your
back
parlour
this
was
thrown
out
at
random
simply
to
create
apprehension
for
joshua
brown
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
within
that
cupboard
was
to
be
found
anything
but
stolen
goods
it
had
even
more
effect
than
he
expected
for
bowes
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
thinking
not
unnaturally
that
some
of
the
most
treasured
secrets
of
his
dwelling
had
been
by
some
strange
chance
discovered
still
however
caution
was
uppermost
and
he
sat
as
mute
as
a
fish
however
that
not
the
question
now
said
joshua
brown
what
i
want
to
ask
is
what
are
you
up
to
just
now
mr
bowes
i
do
see
what
that
is
to
you
said
the
worthy
whom
he
addressed
i
mind
my
business
you
mind
yours
this
was
the
sort
of
timid
boldness
of
a
cat
in
a
corner
but
joshua
brown
was
not
all
moved
thereby
it
a
great
deal
to
me
he
answered
for
the
case
is
this
bowes
i
and
another
gentleman
a
friend
of
mine
were
robbed
the
other
night
in
the
lane
just
beyond
some
of
the
goods
you
got
and
sent
up
to
london
some
you
did
get
bowes
gave
a
start
for
this
was
touching
the
reputation
of
subordinates
now
i
and
the
other
gentleman
are
in
the
same
basket
and
i
resolved
that
i
either
have
the
information
i
want
or
the
goods
back
again
all
of
them
or
that
you
and
sam
and
the
other
three
shall
go
across
the
water
to
botany
even
if
nothing
worse
comes
of
it
mingy
bowes
paused
and
considered
for
a
single
instant
and
he
determined
that
in
the
first
instance
at
least
he
would
try
the
dogged
vein
for
to
know
nothing
of
anybody
or
anything
is
very
often
a
rogue
first
resource
i
do
know
anything
about
what
you
mean
by
and
the
other
three
he
replied
you
must
be
joking
i
think
and
as
to
myself
i
should
like
to
hear
what
you
intend
to
do
for
you
ca
hurt
me
i
take
it
that
easily
told
answered
joshua
brown
coolly
i
intend
if
you
do
not
tell
me
what
you
up
to
to
call
for
an
officer
give
you
in
charge
and
tell
the
police
that
if
they
choose
to
send
down
a
gentleman
in
plain
clothes
to
your
place
and
put
out
the
gentleman
you
left
there
they
soon
get
plenty
of
evidence
of
your
trade
and
catch
the
whole
gang
of
you
i
dare
say
a
sergeant
of
the
force
can
carry
on
your
business
for
a
week
or
a
fortnight
quite
as
well
as
you
can
this
was
certainly
a
very
frightful
announcement
to
mingy
bowes
it
was
a
stratagem
he
had
never
dreamed
of
and
his
heart
sank
a
good
deal
but
yet
for
two
or
three
minutes
he
could
not
tell
how
to
enter
into
the
sort
of
compromise
which
seemed
to
be
offered
to
him
without
acknowledging
the
justice
of
the
charges
against
him
an
excuse
for
yielding
without
confessing
seemed
wanting
but
at
length
he
found
one
though
it
was
rather
lame
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
me
he
said
to
be
kept
out
of
my
business
for
a
month
in
that
way
come
speak
out
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
tell
you
i
want
to
know
replied
the
pedlar
what
you
are
up
to
coming
hanging
about
this
hotel
you
know
quite
well
bowes
i
saw
sam
burn
a
belonging
to
a
friend
of
mine
at
the
same
time
he
told
me
what
sort
of
a
story
he
thought
he
had
got
hold
of
in
that
and
though
he
was
wrong
altogether
and
only
making
a
fool
of
himself
i
want
to
know
what
you
and
he
are
upon
now
mingy
considered
for
a
minute
or
two
a
lie
first
came
up
to
his
lips
of
course
but
then
he
recollected
that
all
parties
concerned
were
likely
very
soon
to
hear
everything
which
had
passed
between
him
and
lady
fleetwood
it
is
true
he
never
liked
dealing
with
any
but
principals
but
that
was
a
small
matter
compared
with
a
compromise
in
the
circumstances
of
grave
difficulty
which
surrounded
him
and
he
therefore
replied
well
i
do
mind
telling
you
all
that
if
you
promise
upon
your
life
and
soul
not
to
stop
my
going
back
to
my
own
business
it
was
now
the
pedlar
turn
to
consider
for
to
tell
the
truth
there
was
a
certain
feeling
of
false
honour
about
him
which
made
him
shrink
from
the
idea
of
being
an
informer
but
yet
he
did
not
like
to
give
out
of
his
own
hands
the
power
of
restraining
mingy
actions
in
the
case
with
which
he
was
then
dealing
why
the
case
is
this
said
the
pedlar
you
see
bowes
whenever
i
promise
anything
i
always
do
it
come
what
will
and
now
you
are
asking
me
for
a
great
thing
in
return
for
a
small
thing
i
look
upon
it
that
i
have
got
you
by
the
neck
bowes
as
i
may
say
for
i
can
swear
that
i
saw
at
your
house
one
of
the
men
who
robbed
me
and
gentleman
with
part
of
the
stolen
property
in
his
possession
and
that
you
knowing
it
to
be
stolen
helped
him
to
drive
a
bargain
about
restoring
it
now
you
want
me
to
acquit
you
of
all
this
for
nothing
but
telling
me
something
which
i
shall
know
before
over
that
too
much
it
certainly
was
an
awkward
way
of
putting
the
question
and
mingy
bowes
did
not
at
all
like
the
look
of
things
he
had
recourse
to
silence
as
the
best
resource
and
after
waiting
a
minute
or
two
the
pedlar
proceeded
thus
i
am
inclined
to
be
liberal
bowes
and
do
wish
to
be
hard
upon
any
man
so
if
you
make
a
fair
offer
i
promise
upon
my
word
of
honour
not
to
hurt
you
the
job
is
said
mingy
with
a
sudden
burst
of
frankness
under
the
influence
of
fear
that
i
can
do
anything
you
like
myself
but
i
can
not
answer
for
that
man
sam
he
a
wild
headstrong
devil
worse
than
a
pig
for
he
neither
be
led
nor
driven
nor
pulled
back
by
the
leg
so
i
should
judge
said
joshua
brown
and
one
ca
expect
any
man
to
do
more
than
he
can
do
therefore
if
you
promise
to
tell
us
all
you
know
and
to
work
with
us
afterwards
in
any
way
i
tell
you
this
gentleman
here
a
witness
i
let
you
off
altogether
and
not
mix
you
up
in
the
matter
at
all
it
was
a
hard
pill
to
swallow
for
although
mingy
did
not
possess
much
even
of
that
honour
which
is
said
to
exist
amongst
thieves
yet
he
had
to
remember
that
his
reputation
as
a
trustworthy
receiver
of
stolen
goods
was
at
stake
considering
however
that
promises
are
but
air
and
that
while
that
made
by
the
pedlar
in
presence
of
a
witness
would
at
any
time
give
him
a
fair
opportunity
of
turning
evidence
a
thousand
means
of
evading
his
own
engagements
might
present
themselves
he
took
the
pledge
offered
to
him
and
informed
joshua
brown
of
all
the
plans
and
purposes
of
himself
and
his
excellent
confederate
and
all
that
they
knew
or
thought
they
knew
of
colonel
middleton
while
this
detail
took
place
carlini
sat
by
and
listened
but
at
the
latter
part
of
the
statement
he
laughed
aloud
why
what
a
set
of
fools
you
must
be
he
said
my
master
a
spaniard
by
birth
and
has
lived
almost
all
his
life
in
spain
he
was
in
mexico
at
the
time
you
talk
of
that
i
can
prove
and
the
whole
story
you
have
got
up
could
be
blown
to
pieces
by
gentlemen
now
in
england
the
pedlar
bit
a
piece
of
hard
skin
off
his
thumb
which
in
his
case
was
tantamount
to
an
expression
of
doubt
but
he
said
nothing
for
he
was
very
well
satisfied
that
mingy
bowes
should
be
led
to
disbelieve
the
truth
of
the
story
he
had
heard
are
you
serious
said
the
marine
store
dealer
addressing
carlini
quite
said
the
italian
with
a
scornful
look
your
friend
has
made
some
blunder
bowes
his
excellency
my
master
has
got
cousins
in
london
who
have
known
him
from
his
birth
and
do
what
you
will
you
can
not
make
him
out
anything
but
what
he
is
so
as
this
blackguard
is
going
himself
you
say
to
lady
fleetwood
the
day
after
you
can
let
him
go
he
only
get
himself
into
a
scrape
and
nobody
else
well
i
only
told
you
what
he
told
me
said
mingy
bowes
but
i
do
think
he
told
me
the
whole
and
i
did
not
see
the
inside
of
the
book
that
he
burned
stop
a
bit
said
joshua
brown
at
what
hour
did
you
say
he
was
to
be
there
at
twelve
answered
the
marine
store
dealer
i
was
to
go
with
him
to
introduce
him
but
i
thought
i
would
just
come
here
and
see
the
colonel
myself
to
have
a
little
deal
with
him
if
possible
in
the
first
place
it
is
well
you
did
not
see
him
replied
carlini
for
depend
upon
it
he
would
have
thrown
you
out
of
the
window
he
not
a
man
to
be
frightened
i
can
tell
you
i
should
think
not
said
joshua
brown
with
a
laugh
but
now
bowes
as
all
things
are
clear
and
as
we
understand
each
other
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
only
that
you
must
not
go
out
of
town
till
i
tell
you
and
you
must
come
and
see
me
morning
at
ten
mingy
bowes
promised
i
am
very
punctual
said
the
pedlar
with
a
meaning
look
and
as
i
shall
certainly
want
to
speak
with
you
if
you
do
come
i
must
look
for
you
and
get
people
to
help
me
mingy
understood
him
completely
repeated
his
promise
with
a
full
determination
of
keeping
it
for
fear
of
worse
consequences
and
received
the
pedlar
address
no
compton
street
seven
dials
now
mind
said
the
pedlar
as
the
worthy
fence
took
up
his
hat
to
depart
you
not
to
say
a
word
to
sam
of
anything
that
has
happened
till
i
see
you
perhaps
i
may
then
allow
you
to
tell
him
what
a
fool
he
is
making
of
himself
perhaps
i
may
let
him
go
on
and
trap
himself
mingy
bowes
was
all
obedience
for
the
confident
tone
of
the
italian
servant
had
greatly
shaken
his
reliance
on
his
friend
conclusions
and
his
own
somewhat
perilous
position
had
rendered
him
wonderfully
ductile
a
good
deal
chapfallen
he
took
a
very
polite
leave
of
his
two
companions
and
left
them
alone
to
discuss
the
scene
which
had
just
passed
the
first
observation
came
from
the
lips
of
signor
carlo
carlini
who
exclaimed
in
an
indignant
tone
what
a
set
of
blackguards
you
have
in
this
country
of
england
my
countrymen
are
bad
enough
and
so
are
the
spaniards
but
it
seems
to
me
brave
and
honourable
to
attack
a
carriage
perhaps
escorted
by
a
dozen
or
two
of
dragoons
when
compared
with
this
attempt
to
rob
a
man
of
his
money
by
accusing
him
of
a
crime
a
bandit
is
a
gentleman
to
such
a
fellow
as
that
there
are
a
great
number
of
such
i
am
afraid
replied
the
pedlar
these
things
are
happening
every
day
in
london
and
i
have
known
two
or
three
cases
in
which
a
gentleman
in
the
same
situation
as
yourself
has
made
a
great
deal
of
money
and
set
up
a
hotel
upon
the
strength
of
some
letters
which
he
had
found
belonging
to
his
master
you
can
not
form
a
notion
of
all
that
is
going
on
every
day
in
this
great
city
but
wherever
you
get
a
great
number
of
men
together
you
are
sure
to
gather
a
great
quantity
of
rascality
but
as
to
this
business
we
must
talk
to
the
colonel
and
see
what
he
thinks
it
better
for
us
to
do
so
with
your
leave
i
will
stop
till
he
comes
back
and
should
like
in
the
mean
time
to
hear
the
rest
of
the
story
you
were
telling
me
with
all
my
heart
replied
carlini
let
me
see
where
i
was
oh
i
remember
i
was
just
telling
you
how
g
the
rose
to
be
a
prince
and
a
grandee
of
spain
carlini
story
continued
spain
is
a
very
curious
country
sir
a
very
curious
country
indeed
things
happen
there
every
day
that
could
happen
in
no
other
spot
of
the
globe
it
is
like
one
of
those
things
which
i
think
you
call
magic
lanterns
where
the
scenes
are
always
shifting
and
nothing
on
earth
remains
steady
for
an
hour
you
may
see
a
little
ragged
boy
running
in
the
street
and
not
long
after
he
be
walking
about
the
court
a
great
man
in
velvet
and
lace
without
anybody
but
himself
knowing
how
it
happened
there
are
only
four
things
necessary
to
it
impudence
cleverness
youth
and
good
luck
well
as
i
was
saying
g
the
in
a
very
few
months
rose
from
nothing
at
all
to
be
a
prince
and
a
minister
the
old
nobility
grumbled
and
growled
and
all
the
new
people
tried
to
stop
his
progress
till
they
found
it
was
useless
but
in
the
end
the
old
and
the
new
both
together
bowed
down
and
licked
his
feet
all
this
time
as
i
have
said
i
heard
nothing
of
him
and
i
thought
he
had
quite
forgotten
me
and
was
just
as
selfish
and
as
such
sort
of
people
generally
are
but
i
made
a
mistake
sir
and
think
it
but
right
to
do
justice
to
a
man
against
whom
everybody
cries
out
one
day
as
i
was
walking
along
the
street
in
which
his
palace
was
situated
for
he
lived
in
a
palace
by
this
time
i
saw
a
fine
horse
standing
before
the
little
door
there
was
a
great
door
where
the
carriages
went
in
and
three
or
four
servants
all
magnificently
dressed
by
the
side
of
it
just
as
i
was
going
to
pass
who
should
come
out
but
the
prince
himself
in
a
uniform
all
gold
and
feathers
and
jingling
spurs
i
drew
back
with
my
brass
basin
under
my
arm
to
let
him
go
by
thinking
he
would
take
no
notice
of
me
his
eye
fell
upon
me
however
and
he
knew
me
directly
and
stopped
carlini
he
said
that
you
why
you
have
never
been
to
see
me
i
have
forgotten
you
and
if
i
can
do
anything
to
serve
you
i
will
come
to
me
here
at
ten
and
then
he
told
the
servants
to
let
me
be
admitted
there
are
some
people
who
as
the
french
say
suffer
fortune
to
knock
at
their
door
and
do
not
open
but
i
am
not
one
of
that
kind
and
putting
on
the
best
clothes
i
had
i
left
my
brass
basin
and
my
razors
behind
me
and
went
away
the
next
morning
to
see
the
prince
i
suppose
there
were
at
least
twenty
people
in
his
waiting
to
see
him
and
amongst
them
a
great
number
of
noblemen
and
high
officers
but
i
went
through
them
all
after
a
page
and
was
shown
straight
in
i
could
hear
some
of
them
say
to
their
neighbours
that
carlini
the
barber
we
shall
not
see
the
prince
for
an
hour
if
he
only
just
going
to
be
shaved
but
i
laughed
in
my
sleeve
and
went
on
i
found
the
great
man
stretched
at
his
ease
in
a
of
gold
brocade
and
i
stood
near
the
door
bowing
down
to
the
ground
but
he
said
near
carlini
come
near
and
sit
down
and
he
began
to
talk
to
me
just
as
familiarly
as
ever
he
even
spoke
about
the
silk
stockings
and
said
those
silk
stockings
made
my
fortune
and
i
wo
be
ungrateful
to
them
or
you
he
then
went
on
to
speak
of
a
great
number
of
other
things
and
joked
and
laughed
with
me
till
i
believe
the
people
in
the
thought
i
was
telling
him
all
the
scandal
of
the
court
as
barbers
often
will
do
but
at
last
he
began
to
be
more
serious
and
questioned
me
about
what
knowledge
i
possessed
he
had
not
much
himself
so
that
i
do
wonder
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
i
could
read
and
write
speak
several
languages
and
keep
accounts
as
well
as
any
at
length
he
dismissed
me
saying
wo
forget
you
carlini
i
wo
forget
you
and
if
ever
you
think
have
done
so
come
back
at
this
hour
and
they
will
let
you
in
but
i
had
no
occasion
for
three
days
had
scarcely
passed
when
he
sent
for
me
and
told
me
that
the
king
had
graciously
permitted
him
to
name
the
viceroy
of
the
indies
and
that
he
had
appointed
a
certain
nobleman
whose
chin
i
was
very
glad
to
find
had
never
come
under
my
razor
upon
the
condition
that
he
gave
him
the
nomination
of
his
that
is
to
say
a
sort
of
steward
carlini
he
said
this
suits
you
you
shall
have
the
place
and
he
told
me
how
much
it
was
worth
besides
pickings
had
better
take
it
he
said
you
do
mind
going
to
lima
for
it
is
the
best
thing
i
can
offer
you
and
heaven
knows
how
long
i
may
be
here
to
offer
you
anything
fortune
is
fickle
and
as
she
raised
me
up
so
she
may
cast
me
down
but
if
you
take
this
you
at
all
events
open
for
yourself
a
new
path
in
life
which
may
perhaps
lead
to
greatness
and
wealth
i
was
very
much
inclined
to
cast
myself
at
his
feet
and
give
him
honours
more
than
his
due
but
you
need
not
ask
me
whether
i
accepted
the
proposal
which
placed
me
in
a
position
that
i
had
never
even
dreamed
of
obtaining
i
was
introduced
to
the
viceroy
gave
him
apparently
the
fullest
satisfaction
and
set
out
with
him
tor
lima
applying
myself
heartily
to
learn
before
i
reached
the
shores
of
the
new
world
the
business
which
i
was
likely
to
be
called
upon
to
transact
by
close
attention
i
made
such
great
progress
that
my
new
patron
although
at
first
somewhat
cold
towards
me
who
had
been
forced
into
his
service
became
attached
to
me
and
relied
upon
me
entirely
during
two
years
i
transacted
the
whole
business
of
his
household
amassed
great
wealth
and
as
the
business
of
my
actual
office
was
as
small
as
the
emoluments
were
great
i
had
plenty
of
time
both
to
push
my
fortune
and
to
enjoy
my
leisure
the
of
the
viceroy
was
a
very
great
man
his
favour
and
his
influence
were
sought
for
by
all
classes
of
people
a
great
portion
of
the
wealth
of
the
province
passed
through
his
hands
and
enlarging
my
views
with
my
opportunities
i
established
a
bank
in
lima
rendered
a
large
house
in
mexico
a
mere
branch
of
my
establishment
and
passing
from
the
one
city
to
the
other
whenever
the
business
of
my
permitted
became
one
of
the
greatest
dealers
in
the
precious
metals
to
be
found
in
all
the
colonies
but
i
had
fallen
upon
those
changeful
times
which
left
none
of
the
world
goods
firm
and
stable
revolutionary
ideas
began
to
get
abroad
and
with
a
miscalculation
very
common
in
those
who
have
been
born
and
acted
under
one
period
while
passing
to
another
i
thought
the
things
which
i
had
been
accustomed
to
retained
sufficient
vitality
to
last
even
though
the
germs
of
a
new
order
of
events
were
destroying
their
roots
and
pushing
through
the
ground
at
all
events
gratitude
towards
the
viceroy
who
had
been
most
kind
and
generous
towards
me
would
have
induced
me
to
pursue
the
same
course
which
i
did
follow
even
if
i
had
known
that
circumstances
were
against
him
his
friends
would
have
been
my
friends
his
supporters
those
to
whom
i
granted
support
i
was
in
the
world
of
wealth
the
power
of
wealth
was
greater
than
the
power
of
authority
and
as
by
his
generous
carelessness
the
wealth
was
at
my
command
while
the
authority
was
at
his
i
might
be
said
to
be
more
powerful
in
the
indies
than
himself
i
call
heaven
to
witness
that
i
did
not
use
this
great
power
amiss
undoubtedly
i
supported
the
existing
state
of
things
by
it
i
had
risen
on
it
my
fortunes
were
founded
and
no
one
had
a
right
to
attribute
to
me
as
a
crime
gratitude
to
those
who
had
befriended
me
and
the
support
of
institutions
under
which
i
lived
and
prospered
but
then
came
the
revolution
the
colonies
took
advantage
of
the
weakness
of
the
mother
country
a
weakness
which
their
establishment
had
first
caused
and
which
their
support
had
nurtured
they
cast
off
the
yoke
they
forgot
all
former
benefits
i
became
loaded
with
odium
my
bank
was
pillaged
my
property
was
sequestrated
my
house
was
sacked
and
i
was
cast
into
one
of
the
dungeons
of
the
old
inquisition
where
i
remained
for
nine
months
in
a
state
of
horrible
neglect
and
privation
which
it
is
impossible
to
describe
my
food
was
scanty
the
attendance
i
received
grudging
and
unwilling
i
had
no
bed
no
accommodation
of
any
kind
the
mud
in
some
parts
of
the
horrible
cell
to
which
i
was
consigned
was
several
inches
deep
and
the
straw
upon
which
i
slept
was
at
the
bottom
soaked
in
water
i
went
into
that
dreary
abode
a
healthy
and
powerful
man
in
the
early
prime
of
life
i
came
out
a
skeleton
hardly
able
to
drag
my
feeble
limbs
along
by
this
time
some
degree
of
order
was
restored
and
a
show
of
law
was
established
it
was
necessary
to
try
me
as
i
had
been
so
long
confined
and
idle
charges
were
fabricated
to
justify
my
long
detention
and
the
pillage
of
my
property
not
even
the
skill
and
the
malice
of
those
who
seek
to
justify
wrong
could
devise
an
accusation
that
was
tenable
my
accounts
were
all
in
order
and
although
no
person
had
a
right
to
investigate
them
but
the
viceroy
whom
they
had
expelled
they
could
not
even
found
a
charge
upon
them
as
a
base
excuse
however
for
refusing
to
do
me
justice
they
declared
that
i
had
systematically
denied
all
assistance
to
the
leaders
of
the
revolution
in
my
capacity
as
a
banker
and
after
having
been
one
of
the
most
wealthy
men
of
the
land
i
was
cast
upon
the
world
utterly
penniless
there
are
some
men
however
who
act
by
divine
laws
and
not
by
human
ones
i
am
afraid
that
they
are
to
be
found
only
in
the
lower
portion
of
the
middle
class
there
are
none
more
cruelly
tyrannical
than
the
people
none
more
selfishly
careless
than
the
upper
class
the
latter
are
the
best
masters
because
in
their
carelessness
they
are
generous
while
they
have
the
means
the
former
are
the
worst
because
their
minds
have
never
been
expanded
by
prosperity
and
because
their
passions
are
capricious
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
but
in
the
middle
class
you
find
the
men
who
have
lived
by
right
and
equity
and
are
sensible
of
the
benefits
of
right
and
equity
nay
more
who
will
follow
them
sometimes
even
when
they
do
see
good
consequences
to
themselves
i
wandered
through
lima
without
a
friend
as
i
thought
and
certainly
without
a
penny
but
passing
by
the
door
of
a
goldsmith
to
whom
i
had
once
lent
money
he
called
me
in
and
made
his
house
my
home
he
and
i
consulted
with
regard
to
my
affairs
most
of
those
to
whom
i
had
lent
large
sums
had
fled
others
had
joined
the
revolutionary
party
and
were
beyond
my
reach
but
there
were
a
few
who
owed
me
trifling
debts
of
thirty
or
forty
crowns
which
i
had
no
power
of
reclaiming
for
all
my
papers
were
in
the
hands
of
the
state
but
nine
out
of
ten
of
those
who
could
do
so
paid
me
and
i
gained
sufficient
money
to
come
to
europe
and
to
subsist
for
a
few
months
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
adopt
some
new
trade
i
landed
in
france
went
to
paris
offered
myself
as
a
servant
and
became
courier
to
an
english
gentleman
i
travelled
with
him
for
two
years
made
myself
thoroughly
acquainted
with
his
language
of
which
i
had
learned
a
good
deal
before
in
naples
and
at
last
lost
him
for
he
was
drowned
on
a
party
of
pleasure
passing
from
malo
to
jersey
i
then
became
courier
to
a
german
count
but
i
only
remained
in
his
service
for
three
months
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
after
gambling
unsuccessfully
he
left
me
to
provide
for
myself
i
now
found
that
i
was
better
fitted
for
a
barber
than
for
a
courier
and
was
thinking
of
resuming
my
old
profession
when
the
place
of
waiter
at
an
inn
was
offered
to
me
at
bordeaux
there
i
happened
to
meet
with
my
present
master
he
did
not
recollect
me
in
the
least
but
he
was
kind
and
courteous
to
everybody
and
as
the
landlord
endeavoured
to
cheat
him
enormously
one
day
in
a
fit
of
spleen
or
indignation
call
it
what
you
will
i
warned
him
of
the
fact
and
was
dismissed
for
my
pains
by
the
good
master
of
the
house
some
days
after
i
met
his
excellency
in
the
streets
he
remembered
me
as
the
waiter
though
not
as
the
banker
asked
my
circumstances
and
on
my
telling
him
the
whole
story
of
my
dismissal
engaged
me
as
his
servant
with
him
i
have
remained
ever
since
and
as
i
told
you
before
a
better
master
does
not
live
i
have
been
with
him
in
a
good
number
of
different
countries
and
i
know
quite
well
that
if
i
act
faithfully
to
him
i
shall
always
find
him
act
generously
towards
me
i
am
too
old
to
push
my
fortunes
as
i
did
when
i
was
young
and
circumstanced
as
i
am
i
find
although
in
life
i
have
very
often
seen
the
contrary
that
for
me
at
least
according
to
your
english
maxim
honesty
is
the
best
policy
i
have
always
found
it
so
replied
the
pedlar
but
yet
one
sees
people
get
on
wonderfully
by
the
other
course
now
this
very
man
who
was
here
just
now
is
as
great
a
rogue
as
any
in
the
world
and
yet
he
has
risen
from
a
shoeblack
and
made
a
good
deal
of
money
i
am
told
by
pure
lying
and
rascality
i
wonder
if
that
story
he
told
about
his
visits
to
lady
d
is
true
or
false
lady
fleetwood
do
you
mean
said
carlini
oh
we
can
easily
find
that
out
i
know
two
of
her
servants
very
well
her
own
footman
and
the
housekeeper
the
footman
can
tell
whether
this
bowes
has
been
there
and
very
likely
a
good
deal
more
for
i
have
remarked
brown
that
the
servants
of
all
nations
in
whatever
else
they
may
differ
are
alike
in
listening
at
doors
let
us
walk
down
to
the
old
lady
house
we
can
be
back
before
his
excellency
returns
i
dare
say
the
pedlar
thought
the
proposal
a
very
good
one
and
they
accordingly
set
out
whatever
was
the
fruit
of
their
expedition
of
which
more
hereafter
they
received
confirmation
strong
of
the
truth
of
judgment
as
to
the
eavesdropping
propensities
of
english
as
well
as
other
servants
chapter
xxxii
i
really
must
and
will
remonstrate
my
dear
winkworth
said
charles
marston
entering
the
room
where
his
old
friend
was
sitting
how
you
can
risk
your
health
and
your
life
by
neglecting
the
express
directions
of
a
surgeon
you
have
called
in
to
attend
you
i
can
not
conceive
unless
you
wish
to
make
people
believe
you
are
quite
mad
or
meditating
suicide
we
are
all
mad
charles
said
winkworth
every
one
after
his
own
fashion
and
every
man
judging
his
neighbour
by
his
own
madness
thinks
him
insane
on
account
of
the
very
actions
which
most
show
his
sanity
you
are
by
nature
habit
and
education
utterly
idle
idleness
is
your
madness
and
you
would
not
put
yourself
the
least
out
of
your
way
to
perform
the
most
important
business
in
the
world
therefore
it
is
you
think
me
mad
for
neglecting
advice
in
which
i
have
no
confidence
in
order
to
transact
business
which
i
thought
important
business
business
took
me
out
i
tell
you
look
there
and
he
pointed
to
an
ocean
of
old
papers
by
which
he
was
surrounded
and
if
i
choose
to
kill
myself
charles
marston
what
is
that
to
you
i
am
not
your
son
nor
your
ward
nor
your
wife
and
no
man
let
me
tell
you
has
a
right
to
meddle
with
another
man
actions
unless
he
is
affected
by
them
but
i
am
affected
by
this
replied
his
young
companion
you
have
promised
to
take
a
journey
with
me
into
the
country
and
if
you
lay
yourself
up
on
a
sick
bed
you
will
not
only
defraud
me
of
your
society
but
you
will
prevent
me
from
going
too
for
i
must
stop
to
nurse
you
pooh
pooh
cried
the
old
man
i
can
nurse
myself
i
have
nursed
many
other
people
too
long
before
you
were
born
and
i
think
i
can
do
so
still
in
my
own
case
but
i
tell
you
i
do
intend
to
be
and
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
for
as
soon
as
i
get
through
these
papers
which
will
take
me
about
more
i
may
want
to
talk
to
you
i
shall
wait
here
then
replied
charles
for
my
uncle
scriven
sent
to
say
he
would
call
about
this
time
i
wo
see
him
exclaimed
winkworth
impetuously
have
him
taken
into
another
room
i
wo
see
him
at
all
events
not
yet
it
would
do
me
more
harm
than
all
the
journeys
in
the
world
ho
ho
cried
charles
laughing
so
then
you
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
my
opinion
of
my
worthy
uncle
is
not
quite
so
wrong
as
you
at
first
thought
it
i
never
thought
it
wrong
said
winkworth
who
was
in
one
of
his
polemical
humours
i
had
no
business
to
think
about
it
because
i
had
no
data
and
all
i
concluded
was
that
it
was
either
a
great
pity
a
nephew
should
think
so
of
his
uncle
or
a
great
pity
that
an
uncle
should
give
a
nephew
reasonable
cause
so
to
think
now
i
have
data
and
he
laid
his
hand
upon
some
of
the
papers
before
him
these
documents
belong
to
that
poor
thing
we
met
upon
the
common
miss
hayley
how
she
has
saved
them
how
she
has
preserved
them
in
all
she
has
gone
through
i
do
know
but
it
now
seems
to
me
very
clear
why
your
uncle
wants
to
keep
her
in
a
madhouse
indeed
exclaimed
charles
marston
a
frown
coming
upon
his
brow
and
a
flush
into
his
cheek
pray
let
me
hear
my
dear
sir
for
although
i
do
not
doubt
that
scriven
is
a
very
honourable
man
as
the
world
goes
yet
i
know
he
always
has
his
motives
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
what
they
are
in
this
instance
no
i
wo
answered
winkworth
abruptly
at
least
not
at
present
charlie
you
shall
hear
more
but
before
i
speak
upon
any
subject
i
like
to
know
it
thoroughly
myself
and
before
i
act
in
any
matter
i
like
to
consider
how
i
had
best
act
but
where
is
miss
hayley
how
did
you
find
out
exclaimed
charles
marston
she
is
in
a
madhouse
at
brooke
green
replied
winkworth
and
i
found
out
by
the
boy
jim
who
tracked
her
with
the
instinct
of
true
affection
now
that
is
all
that
you
need
know
for
the
present
charles
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
said
in
a
mild
tone
i
wish
winkworth
you
would
tell
me
more
for
your
words
lead
me
to
believe
in
some
degree
that
the
honour
of
one
member
of
my
family
at
least
is
somewhat
affected
by
this
business
yet
i
can
not
insist
as
i
am
debarred
from
acting
as
i
should
like
to
act
in
behalf
of
this
poor
thing
why
debarred
said
winkworth
by
my
father
unfortunate
situation
replied
charles
i
look
upon
it
as
my
duty
my
dear
sir
to
make
over
the
income
of
my
poor
mother
whole
property
which
my
father
assigned
to
me
to
him
for
his
life
i
have
thus
nothing
on
earth
to
bestow
upon
poor
miss
hayley
otherwise
i
had
proposed
out
of
old
affection
for
her
and
hers
to
settle
upon
her
what
would
make
her
independent
winkworth
got
up
and
walked
once
or
twice
across
the
room
then
turning
sharply
round
he
said
you
shall
do
it
my
dear
charles
do
you
know
i
intend
to
leave
you
all
i
possess
there
no
words
about
it
i
told
lady
anne
so
a
little
while
ago
and
now
tell
me
what
your
father
allowed
you
not
a
word
about
any
other
subject
charles
paused
for
a
moment
as
if
overpowered
by
his
emotions
but
winkworth
waved
his
hand
impatiently
and
he
replied
nearly
two
thousand
my
dear
sir
the
whole
interest
in
fact
of
my
mother
fortune
then
i
will
allow
you
the
same
said
winkworth
i
adopt
you
as
a
son
you
wo
be
the
worse
for
two
fathers
especially
when
one
is
away
and
i
am
a
nabob
you
know
who
could
eat
gold
if
i
liked
were
it
not
that
the
food
is
indigestible
and
to
tell
the
truth
been
so
long
accustomed
to
feed
upon
rice
and
to
wear
one
coat
the
whole
year
that
i
fear
anything
like
dainty
diet
and
rich
apparel
would
be
the
death
of
me
hark
there
is
somebody
coming
to
the
door
that
your
uncle
i
warrant
take
him
quickly
through
the
room
to
that
one
beyond
do
introduce
him
and
let
me
finish
what
i
am
about
the
last
words
were
spoken
just
as
scriven
was
entering
the
room
and
as
he
was
by
no
means
deaf
he
must
have
heard
them
he
gazed
coldly
upon
winkworth
however
as
he
advanced
towards
his
nephew
but
the
old
gentleman
merely
raised
his
head
for
an
instant
made
a
slight
bow
and
resumed
the
reading
of
the
papers
before
him
while
charles
led
his
uncle
into
a
small
room
beyond
as
may
be
supposed
from
all
that
had
lately
passed
between
uncle
and
nephew
charles
did
not
feel
very
cordial
towards
scriven
but
that
gentleman
cared
very
little
about
it
he
did
not
trouble
himself
about
affections
they
were
not
in
his
way
of
business
well
charles
he
said
a
lawyer
has
been
to
me
to
inquire
into
the
particulars
of
the
property
settled
upon
you
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
borrow
money
not
a
penny
replied
charles
marston
drily
then
what
is
this
lawyer
object
asked
scriven
was
he
sent
by
you
if
so
why
he
was
sent
by
me
replied
charles
and
for
this
reason
my
father
on
my
coming
of
age
having
plenty
of
money
himself
settled
upon
me
the
income
of
my
mother
property
to
which
he
was
entitled
during
his
life
now
he
has
not
plenty
of
money
and
i
am
going
to
give
him
back
what
he
gave
to
me
it
must
be
done
legally
and
therefore
i
have
employed
a
lawyer
you
as
the
trustee
have
the
papers
and
he
must
see
them
very
good
said
scriven
and
pray
how
do
you
intend
to
live
yourself
by
my
wits
answered
charles
as
many
other
people
do
i
believe
oh
plenty
plenty
said
scriven
pray
have
you
seen
your
friend
colonel
middleton
lately
yes
i
walked
with
him
for
an
hour
this
morning
answered
charles
his
colour
a
good
deal
heightened
at
the
insinuation
which
lay
couched
in
his
uncle
abrupt
question
then
he
has
not
gone
down
to
frimley
again
to
look
for
miss
hayley
said
scriven
with
a
meaning
smile
charles
paused
a
good
deal
struck
this
was
a
new
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
proving
that
henry
hayley
and
frank
middleton
were
one
but
he
feared
the
use
his
uncle
might
make
of
the
fact
if
he
could
once
establish
it
and
replied
you
still
suspect
him
of
being
henry
hayley
i
see
but
i
fancy
you
would
have
great
difficulty
in
proving
it
i
have
no
interest
in
proving
it
replied
scriven
in
an
indifferent
tone
it
would
not
benefit
me
however
as
you
have
now
explained
what
this
lawyer
wants
he
shall
have
copies
of
the
deeds
of
course
you
have
a
right
to
do
what
you
like
with
your
own
but
if
you
will
follow
my
advice
you
will
take
care
what
you
are
about
for
if
your
father
creditors
get
hold
of
the
capital
it
will
benefit
neither
him
nor
you
i
will
take
care
replied
charles
and
merely
saying
scriven
walked
away
passing
winkworth
without
taking
any
notice
when
charles
marston
rejoined
his
old
friend
in
the
other
room
which
he
did
not
do
till
he
had
stood
and
pondered
for
several
minutes
winkworth
looked
up
suddenly
and
addressed
himself
at
once
to
the
very
point
which
had
been
the
subject
of
his
young
meditations
can
you
tell
me
anything
charles
he
said
of
a
young
man
whom
i
find
frequently
mentioned
in
these
papers
a
nephew
of
miss
hayley
named
henry
i
can
tell
you
much
my
dear
sir
replied
charles
and
strange
to
say
i
was
thinking
of
him
at
that
very
moment
from
some
words
that
my
uncle
let
fall
henry
hayley
was
the
son
of
my
uncle
partner
and
an
old
schoolfellow
of
mine
he
was
accused
when
he
was
little
more
than
sixteen
i
know
all
that
i
know
all
that
said
winkworth
hastily
it
is
all
written
down
here
and
i
remember
seeing
something
of
the
story
in
the
newspapers
he
fled
to
the
continent
from
the
pursuit
of
justice
but
what
became
of
him
then
it
was
said
he
died
replied
charles
marston
and
the
officer
who
was
sent
in
pursuit
of
him
declared
that
he
had
seen
his
dead
body
at
ancona
my
uncle
however
contends
that
he
is
still
alive
and
certainly
the
likeness
between
him
and
our
friend
colonel
middleton
is
very
extraordinary
winkworth
mused
for
a
minute
or
two
turned
over
the
papers
before
him
and
examined
some
passages
carefully
from
what
i
know
of
middleton
he
said
at
length
your
suspicions
must
be
wrong
henry
hayley
would
have
sought
for
the
aunt
who
seems
to
have
loved
him
so
well
middleton
went
down
to
frimley
a
few
nights
ago
replied
charles
i
had
told
my
good
aunt
fleetwood
of
our
meeting
with
miss
hayley
on
the
common
and
i
doubt
not
that
she
mentioned
the
fact
in
his
presence
winkworth
mused
again
but
he
was
uncommonly
taciturn
upon
the
subject
i
must
speak
to
middleton
about
all
this
he
said
there
is
some
mystery
here
which
should
be
solved
i
wish
charles
you
would
send
your
fellow
to
see
if
he
can
find
middleton
and
bring
him
hither
charles
immediately
acceded
but
the
servant
returned
with
an
intimation
that
colonel
middleton
had
gone
into
hertfordshire
i
left
the
message
however
sir
he
said
and
the
waiter
assured
me
it
should
be
delivered
as
soon
as
the
gentleman
came
back
some
hours
passed
in
the
usual
occupations
of
the
day
winkworth
sat
and
read
wrote
and
thought
while
charles
marston
went
in
and
out
upon
various
matters
of
business
dined
with
his
aunt
fleetwood
and
maria
and
returned
somewhat
late
to
the
hotel
to
his
surprise
charles
found
winkworth
still
up
and
as
he
was
going
to
commence
a
serious
remonstrance
the
old
gentleman
lifted
up
his
finger
with
a
smile
saying
middleton
has
been
here
and
the
surgeon
so
say
not
a
word
or
i
disinherit
you
cut
you
off
with
a
shilling
listen
therefore
to
my
new
resolution
lady
anne
mellent
sets
out
morning
i
know
she
does
replied
charles
your
aunt
and
cousin
go
at
six
on
the
following
day
continued
winkworth
but
they
are
young
people
especially
lady
fleetwood
i
never
saw
any
one
so
young
in
my
life
you
i
and
middleton
are
old
and
can
not
bear
travelling
therefore
we
will
all
take
our
departure
about
five
evening
not
a
word
it
is
all
settled
middleton
and
i
arranged
it
all
and
the
surgeon
said
it
was
a
capital
plan
for
as
i
told
him
i
must
and
would
go
either
that
night
or
the
following
day
having
made
up
my
mind
to
be
at
belford
on
thursday
next
he
declared
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
travel
slowly
than
quickly
and
to
begin
in
the
cool
of
evening
in
short
he
perfectly
approved
declared
i
was
going
on
quite
well
and
left
me
with
an
impression
which
i
never
entertained
before
that
he
is
an
honest
man
and
a
clever
doctor
charles
saw
that
it
would
be
vain
to
oppose
and
contented
himself
with
asking
but
what
did
middleton
say
of
himself
could
you
make
anything
of
his
history
my
dear
charles
he
is
an
enigma
replied
winkworth
and
as
i
am
the
least
of
an
oe
dipus
of
any
man
that
ever
lived
i
very
soon
gave
him
up
one
thing
however
is
clear
he
is
a
gentleman
in
every
respect
and
a
very
distinguished
one
he
is
moreover
as
rich
as
cr
oe
sus
a
jew
or
a
nabob
i
told
him
plainly
the
doubts
or
rather
suspicions
which
have
been
entertained
and
he
merely
laughed
at
them
seeming
to
be
highly
amused
at
your
uncle
conduct
at
lady
fleetwood
house
which
by
his
account
must
have
been
exceedingly
strange
very
strange
indeed
and
by
no
means
agreeable
replied
charles
but
did
middleton
tell
you
nothing
at
all
about
himself
the
old
gentleman
laughed
oh
yes
he
said
he
told
me
many
things
but
the
most
important
he
would
not
tell
and
so
the
rest
was
of
little
use
now
charles
i
shall
go
to
bed
for
you
know
it
is
quite
needful
for
a
feeble
old
man
like
me
with
a
bad
habit
of
getting
wounded
in
the
shoulder
to
take
care
of
himself
which
of
course
you
never
do
replied
his
young
companion
smiling
i
shall
not
meet
you
at
breakfast
however
sir
for
i
go
early
to
lady
anne
to
see
her
off
good
very
good
said
winkworth
and
walked
away
into
his
while
charles
remained
for
a
moment
or
two
with
that
strong
inclination
to
think
which
often
comes
upon
a
man
about
midnight
he
soon
found
however
that
thinking
was
a
most
fruitless
occupation
and
he
too
retired
to
rest
chapter
xxxiii
it
is
a
most
unfortunate
and
thing
that
the
fairies
have
quitted
england
how
it
happened
i
do
not
know
nor
is
the
period
of
their
departure
exactly
ascertained
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
it
was
about
the
time
of
the
great
rebellion
when
the
whole
people
of
the
country
were
so
busy
about
other
things
that
they
had
hardly
time
to
eat
their
breakfasts
and
none
to
knock
holes
in
the
bottoms
of
their
so
that
the
fairies
had
a
fleet
of
little
ships
ready
prepared
for
them
to
cross
the
channel
when
they
thought
fit
nor
is
it
at
all
wonderful
that
they
should
choose
that
time
for
going
with
the
fairy
of
order
at
their
head
for
every
one
knows
that
the
good
little
people
are
strongly
averse
to
anarchy
and
confusion
and
dissension
of
every
kind
so
that
when
oberon
and
titania
quarrel
i
have
it
upon
good
authority
the
whole
of
the
royal
train
except
puck
who
stands
by
and
laughs
hide
themselves
away
under
harebells
and
columbines
and
only
peep
out
with
one
eye
to
see
when
the
storm
has
blown
over
however
certain
it
is
that
they
are
all
gone
left
our
shores
i
fear
for
ever
nothing
can
be
done
by
magic
now
the
milk
remains
unchurned
and
no
more
is
seen
before
the
fire
stretched
at
his
length
the
lubbard
fiend
all
the
business
of
the
world
goes
on
at
a
and
that
trot
is
very
often
a
slow
one
so
lady
anne
mellent
found
it
at
milford
for
the
people
were
not
at
all
accustomed
to
work
fast
or
obey
promptly
and
they
did
not
believe
the
stories
told
by
the
servant
whom
she
had
left
behind
in
regard
to
her
impatience
of
disobedience
and
delay
early
in
the
morning
a
whole
host
of
servants
headed
by
the
butler
and
housekeeper
arrived
at
milford
castle
but
when
lady
anne
herself
appeared
with
good
brice
her
former
governess
she
found
everything
in
the
most
woeful
state
of
confusion
there
was
no
end
of
embarrassments
almost
all
the
servants
were
congregated
in
the
great
hall
waiting
for
her
coming
and
all
were
full
of
complaints
of
grimes
and
the
steward
i
never
saw
such
neglect
in
my
life
my
lady
said
the
tall
stately
housekeeper
dressed
in
a
silk
shot
with
amethyst
and
green
this
good
woman
this
grimes
tells
me
that
she
used
almost
all
the
coals
in
the
house
last
night
and
this
morning
and
that
there
are
heaven
knows
how
many
miles
to
send
for
more
there
is
not
a
bit
of
charcoal
in
the
house
my
lady
said
the
cook
advancing
in
his
white
nightcap
and
apron
and
barker
here
says
it
is
my
fault
for
not
bringing
it
in
the
fourgon
now
i
could
not
lumber
the
fourgon
all
the
way
from
london
with
charcoal
where
are
the
for
my
lady
room
mrs
barker
said
lady
anne
maid
addressing
the
housekeeper
in
a
loud
tone
aside
i
declare
said
one
of
the
footmen
in
an
audible
tone
just
behind
the
butler
back
i
do
think
that
either
oil
or
candles
were
remembered
nor
blacking
said
another
nor
soap
said
a
very
broad
housemaid
the
meat
is
all
grumbled
the
cook
and
the
poultry
has
been
sent
in
with
all
the
feathers
on
added
the
with
a
sort
of
hysterical
scream
at
the
thought
of
the
eternity
of
plucking
before
her
and
the
scullion
lady
anne
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
which
no
sense
of
dignity
could
restrain
it
was
evident
that
there
were
no
fairies
there
to
favour
her
though
heaven
knows
if
there
had
been
one
in
the
island
he
or
she
would
have
been
there
with
counsel
to
support
the
lady
of
the
castle
seeing
that
her
merriment
was
becoming
infectious
lady
anne
made
a
great
effort
to
suppress
it
and
was
turning
away
towards
the
telling
the
housekeeper
to
follow
her
when
a
girl
ran
in
exclaiming
apparently
in
reference
to
something
which
had
passed
just
before
the
lady
arrival
butter
they
say
there
not
a
pound
of
butter
within
twenty
miles
it
was
too
much
for
human
endurance
and
making
the
best
of
her
way
into
the
lady
anne
sat
down
and
wiped
the
merry
tears
from
her
eyes
while
the
housekeeper
stood
before
her
looking
exceedingly
rueful
let
me
have
my
said
the
young
lady
at
length
now
barker
she
said
have
the
goodness
to
let
me
know
everything
that
is
wanting
in
your
department
and
the
cook
oh
my
lady
i
ca
manage
the
cook
exclaimed
the
housekeeper
in
a
tone
of
spiteful
dignity
he
has
been
raging
like
a
wild
beast
all
the
morning
i
am
sure
i
was
very
glad
when
your
ladyship
came
for
i
thought
he
would
have
eaten
some
of
us
up
cooked
you
i
suppose
you
mean
replied
her
lady
i
will
very
soon
manage
him
if
you
can
not
go
and
make
me
out
a
list
then
of
what
you
want
yourself
and
remember
that
it
be
complete
send
the
butler
here
the
butler
when
he
entered
received
nearly
the
same
orders
and
then
the
cook
being
introduced
made
his
complaint
in
formal
terms
in
regard
to
the
state
of
everything
in
the
house
the
very
pots
pans
and
kettles
were
not
according
to
his
mind
the
meat
was
all
no
fish
had
yet
appeared
butter
was
not
to
be
had
eggs
were
scanty
and
the
vegetables
which
the
garden
produced
had
been
out
of
season
in
london
for
a
full
month
lady
anne
listened
to
him
with
the
utmost
patience
but
when
he
had
done
she
said
in
a
grave
tone
monsieur
hacker
i
wonder
to
hear
you
speak
in
this
way
i
had
always
thought
that
a
man
of
your
great
skill
could
out
of
an
ox
head
or
foot
produce
at
least
three
courses
it
is
in
emergencies
such
as
the
present
that
the
genius
of
a
great
man
appears
go
sir
and
out
of
such
materials
as
you
have
show
me
what
your
art
can
do
i
shall
dine
at
eight
but
in
the
mean
time
as
there
will
be
servants
going
both
to
bedford
and
wooler
you
can
make
out
a
list
of
all
that
is
absolutely
necessary
and
send
it
to
both
places
gradually
we
shall
get
what
is
required
from
london
but
at
present
remember
i
expect
to
see
a
triumph
of
art
my
lady
you
shall
not
be
disappointed
said
the
cook
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
it
is
only
that
barker
enrages
me
with
her
very
well
replied
lady
anne
see
that
she
does
not
enrage
you
any
more
lest
your
lady
service
should
suffer
the
man
retired
and
with
a
gay
glance
to
poor
brice
who
had
been
confounded
at
the
symptoms
of
rebellion
she
had
witnessed
lady
anne
gave
way
to
another
burst
of
merriment
which
she
had
repressed
in
the
man
presence
in
order
to
treat
him
with
that
dignified
consideration
which
is
especially
required
by
the
vainest
of
all
creatures
upon
earth
not
even
excepting
and
poets
some
degree
of
order
in
the
proceedings
of
the
household
was
soon
the
lists
were
made
out
very
formidable
it
must
be
confessed
in
length
and
details
and
a
copy
of
each
was
sent
off
to
wooler
and
belford
some
fine
trout
were
brought
in
in
the
course
of
the
morning
and
also
a
salmon
it
was
found
just
possible
when
people
set
about
it
willingly
to
obtain
butter
and
coals
within
a
less
distance
than
twenty
miles
and
although
from
time
to
time
during
the
rest
of
the
day
a
fresh
want
was
discovered
and
a
little
noise
was
made
about
it
like
an
occasional
roar
of
thunder
after
a
storm
has
passed
by
all
went
on
very
tolerably
considering
till
at
length
about
five
a
cart
was
seen
wending
towards
the
house
the
driver
of
which
bore
a
note
to
lady
anne
my
dear
child
it
ran
i
saw
very
clearly
yesterday
that
you
know
not
northumberland
that
you
forgot
milford
has
not
been
regularly
inhabited
for
more
than
ten
years
and
that
is
in
somewhat
of
a
remote
district
i
have
therefore
sent
you
over
some
of
the
produce
of
my
farms
to
supply
deficiencies
for
and
i
shall
come
and
dine
with
you
and
inquire
what
can
be
done
to
render
you
service
by
your
faithful
servant
and
admirer
charles
hargrave
columbus
when
he
first
discovered
the
shores
of
a
new
continent
hardly
felt
as
much
satisfaction
as
mons
hacker
when
he
saw
the
contents
of
that
cart
the
mutton
the
fine
river
and
sea
fish
the
white
poultry
the
fat
pigeons
the
ducklings
the
the
eggs
the
butter
the
green
goose
the
fine
vegetables
the
fruit
everything
was
there
that
could
be
thought
of
and
he
went
from
one
article
to
another
murmuring
en
compottes
matelottes
rôtis
aux
cressons
mon
dieu
if
we
had
truffles
it
would
be
complete
and
the
heart
of
the
cook
rejoiced
with
a
pure
and
high
devotion
for
the
honour
of
his
art
and
of
his
mistress
for
he
knew
that
on
that
day
lady
fleetwood
and
maria
monkton
were
expected
to
dine
at
milford
and
for
the
latter
lady
he
entertained
that
reverent
affection
which
all
really
chivalrous
cooks
feel
towards
beauty
his
last
and
severest
trial
was
to
discover
that
nothing
but
brown
bread
was
to
be
procured
in
the
neighbourhood
for
which
there
was
no
remedy
but
nevertheless
that
was
not
his
fault
and
when
about
seven
the
rush
of
wheels
was
heard
and
carriage
drove
up
to
the
gates
he
felt
a
proud
satisfaction
at
the
odours
which
were
rising
up
around
him
as
an
incense
which
had
not
risen
from
the
altars
of
milford
for
many
a
long
year
the
dinner
was
laid
in
the
great
for
lady
anne
had
determined
to
make
the
first
impression
of
her
ancestral
castle
as
imposing
as
possible
upon
her
young
friend
the
reader
may
ask
why
and
may
say
was
it
like
her
so
gay
so
joyous
so
thoughtless
so
careless
of
show
ceremony
or
parade
nevertheless
it
was
so
she
had
laid
it
all
out
she
had
even
condescended
to
a
little
trickery
although
at
that
season
of
the
year
there
was
light
enough
remaining
in
the
sky
at
a
quarter
past
eight
when
they
began
their
dinner
to
proceed
with
the
first
course
at
least
with
no
aid
but
from
the
beams
of
heaven
yet
she
had
ordered
two
windows
at
the
side
to
be
shut
up
leaving
unclosed
only
the
large
oriel
window
at
the
end
filled
with
stained
glass
over
the
table
which
looked
almost
like
a
speck
in
the
centre
of
the
great
hall
hung
an
but
silver
chandelier
with
eight
branches
lighted
but
yet
the
beams
only
illumined
the
table
and
a
sort
of
uncertain
twilight
pervaded
the
remoter
parts
of
the
hall
except
where
a
sideboard
loaded
with
ancient
plate
appeared
lighted
by
several
old
candlesticks
lady
anne
had
so
contrived
it
that
in
coming
from
the
great
to
the
hall
the
little
party
passed
through
several
other
rooms
but
faintly
lighted
and
in
so
doing
lady
anne
managed
that
maria
should
occupy
the
middle
place
between
her
and
lady
fleetwood
as
they
entered
the
hall
too
she
looked
up
in
her
young
friend
face
while
her
eyes
ran
over
the
fine
old
chamber
which
with
its
lights
in
the
centre
its
mysterious
gloom
at
the
end
the
table
and
sideboard
the
number
of
servants
in
their
handsome
liveries
the
large
antique
chandelier
of
silver
and
its
silver
chain
the
tall
stained
glass
oriel
at
the
end
and
the
evening
light
faintly
streaming
through
only
just
sufficiently
to
throw
long
lines
of
yellow
purple
blue
and
even
red
upon
the
floor
and
ceiling
and
those
three
graceful
women
entering
looked
more
like
some
painter
dream
of
the
ancient
time
than
anything
that
is
seen
in
our
own
stiff
and
tinselled
days
what
a
beautiful
hall
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
looking
round
is
it
cold
and
at
the
same
moment
her
foot
passed
from
the
rim
of
marble
which
ran
round
the
whole
chamber
and
took
the
first
step
on
the
ocean
of
turkey
carpet
with
which
of
the
floor
was
covered
i
think
not
answered
lady
anne
at
all
events
i
shall
try
dear
lady
fleetwood
to
keep
it
warm
and
gay
while
i
am
here
is
it
a
fine
hall
maria
it
is
indeed
replied
maria
the
span
of
the
vault
is
so
great
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
were
in
westminster
hall
oh
no
no
cried
lady
anne
not
amongst
lawyers
in
black
gowns
but
come
maria
you
take
that
end
of
the
table
and
be
mistress
of
the
house
i
will
act
master
for
the
present
and
lady
fleetwood
shall
be
our
guest
do
you
know
dear
lady
she
continued
seating
herself
i
intend
to
be
very
gay
while
you
are
all
here
and
to
have
a
grand
ball
and
a
number
of
and
that
we
shall
amuse
ourselves
all
the
morning
and
sing
and
dance
and
flirt
all
the
night
and
have
all
the
great
people
of
the
county
who
will
come
wo
that
be
very
delightful
maria
very
splendid
indeed
said
maria
with
a
smile
like
the
splendour
of
a
when
it
bursts
said
lady
anne
quite
gravely
but
why
did
you
call
it
splendid
maria
why
did
you
not
say
pleasant
charming
delightful
because
i
am
sure
i
should
like
milford
quite
as
well
without
any
such
gaieties
replied
maria
monkton
you
know
i
am
not
particularly
fond
of
large
parties
anne
and
although
one
must
mingle
with
them
and
some
of
them
are
pleasant
enough
yet
i
hardly
think
they
deserve
the
epithet
of
charming
or
delightful
cynic
said
lady
anne
mellent
and
proceeded
to
eat
her
dinner
with
a
somewhat
pouting
air
as
if
she
were
hardly
well
pleased
she
was
soon
as
gay
again
as
ever
and
when
they
returned
to
the
she
opened
the
window
and
gazed
out
with
maria
upon
the
starry
sky
which
looked
almost
misty
with
its
innumerable
lights
and
upon
the
park
with
its
undulating
slopes
and
the
tall
dark
masses
of
the
trees
cutting
black
upon
the
luminous
heaven
they
had
been
silent
for
some
time
while
lady
fleetwood
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
netting
one
of
the
innumerable
purses
which
had
afforded
her
a
grand
source
of
occupation
through
life
but
suddenly
lady
anne
lips
moved
and
she
said
aloud
as
her
eyes
remained
fixed
upon
one
spot
of
the
sky
thronged
with
stars
oh
ye
bright
and
glorious
wanderers
of
the
night
had
you
voices
as
men
dreamed
in
days
of
old
to
tell
the
fate
of
those
born
under
your
influence
how
gladly
would
i
ask
the
destiny
of
those
who
here
stand
and
gaze
upon
you
say
arcturus
wilt
thou
take
me
in
thy
car
and
let
me
see
the
storms
and
tempests
that
wait
my
onward
course
and
that
of
the
dear
girl
beside
me
or
thou
planet
of
love
and
hope
just
climbing
the
hill
of
heaven
wilt
thou
tell
me
whether
the
seeds
which
have
been
sown
in
our
hearts
under
thine
influence
will
bud
and
blossom
into
the
flowers
we
dream
of
shall
we
go
on
hand
in
hand
together
even
unto
the
end
as
hitherto
we
have
lived
in
deep
affection
shall
the
ties
which
bind
us
in
nearer
kindred
unite
our
hearts
still
more
closely
or
shall
the
love
that
knows
no
sharer
wean
us
of
our
youthful
tenderness
towards
each
other
i
ask
not
to
hear
what
will
be
the
frowns
or
smiles
of
fortune
whether
the
dull
earth
wealth
will
be
augmented
or
diminished
whether
we
shall
meet
reverse
accident
or
care
ay
or
even
poverty
or
early
death
i
only
ask
shall
we
love
and
be
beloved
for
surely
that
is
to
know
enough
of
fate
and
turning
away
towards
maria
she
leaned
her
brow
upon
her
fair
friend
shoulder
for
a
moment
or
two
maria
was
silent
and
then
she
said
in
a
low
tone
if
the
stars
could
have
answered
you
would
you
have
asked
them
anne
yes
yes
eagerly
replied
lady
anne
would
not
you
maria
i
think
so
answered
maria
yet
sometimes
perhaps
it
were
better
not
to
know
our
fate
oh
no
no
exclaimed
lady
anne
doubt
is
always
horrible
yes
but
there
may
be
trust
without
knowledge
faith
without
comprehension
replied
her
fair
friend
i
have
both
although
the
future
is
very
dark
and
impenetrable
to
me
just
now
oh
it
shall
be
bright
cried
lady
anne
mine
shall
be
the
voice
of
those
brilliant
stars
which
rolling
millions
of
miles
above
all
earthly
things
may
well
see
stretched
out
beneath
their
eyes
of
living
light
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
of
each
existing
thing
oh
yes
it
shall
be
bright
maria
for
you
the
future
hours
are
weaving
a
wreath
first
is
the
early
bud
of
love
now
to
a
rose
and
then
the
clustering
to
speak
domestic
happiness
and
peace
the
passionate
violet
hiding
its
intense
blue
eyes
in
the
shade
and
spreading
rapture
perfume
round
and
the
proud
imperial
lily
portrait
of
high
station
and
the
world
esteem
the
pansy
too
imaging
the
sunshine
of
the
breast
and
pure
enduring
faith
and
the
linked
hyacinth
with
its
many
buds
all
all
are
there
sweet
sister
for
you
and
him
you
love
and
the
wandering
seasons
as
they
pass
along
shall
not
unfold
a
flower
or
ripen
a
fruit
that
shall
not
fall
into
your
hand
if
your
wishes
can
command
fate
said
maria
it
is
the
voice
of
hope
and
not
of
the
stars
you
speak
dear
anne
nay
nay
i
am
a
prophetess
just
now
replied
lady
anne
beware
how
you
doubt
cassandra
lest
she
predict
woes
as
well
as
blessings
i
see
a
little
cloud
coming
and
the
stars
tell
me
it
is
very
near
it
sweeps
over
the
face
of
the
moon
but
the
moon
scatters
it
and
the
blue
sky
drinks
it
up
dear
me
is
the
moon
risen
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
lady
anne
fanciful
visions
were
gone
in
a
moment
oh
dear
she
said
to
maria
with
a
low
voice
and
a
sigh
i
forgot
we
were
in
this
world
but
always
something
brings
us
back
to
it
no
she
is
not
risen
yet
dear
lady
fleetwood
i
thought
you
said
you
saw
her
said
lady
fleetwood
i
was
only
romancing
replied
lady
anne
this
is
an
age
when
our
young
women
dream
dreams
but
now
i
talk
sober
sense
you
know
lady
fleetwood
that
i
am
going
to
have
three
gentlemen
to
stay
with
me
and
you
must
act
quite
the
lady
of
the
house
for
decorum
sake
be
a
very
discreet
chaperon
and
not
take
the
slightest
notice
if
i
choose
to
flirt
most
desperately
with
winkworth
or
any
one
else
i
do
the
same
and
not
take
any
notice
when
you
flirt
with
any
one
or
maria
either
i
am
sure
dear
lady
anne
maria
never
flirts
said
lady
fleetwood
in
the
most
way
in
the
world
bless
her
heart
then
she
shall
do
it
for
once
just
to
keep
me
in
countenance
exclaimed
lady
anne
but
remember
you
are
to
be
chaperon
lady
fleetwood
and
to
look
as
demure
as
possible
but
where
is
mrs
brice
said
lady
fleetwood
i
have
seen
her
since
we
came
oh
dear
me
i
forgot
brice
said
lady
anne
well
she
will
do
quite
as
well
for
a
chaperon
and
so
you
shall
have
leave
to
flirt
too
but
the
truth
is
she
so
tired
with
her
journey
and
so
frightened
with
the
desolation
we
found
reigning
in
these
halls
that
she
said
she
would
not
come
down
and
dined
in
her
own
room
she
will
be
as
brisk
as
ever
i
dare
say
and
that
will
just
do
for
i
expect
hargrave
whom
i
am
in
love
with
and
intend
to
marry
to
dine
with
us
also
mr
hargrave
intend
to
marry
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
and
maria
both
together
certainly
said
lady
anne
he
is
the
dearest
cleverest
most
beautiful
old
man
in
the
world
in
a
velvet
coat
embroidered
waistcoat
and
black
velvet
breeches
just
like
a
fine
piece
of
dresden
china
well
preserved
he
is
moreover
the
soul
of
honour
and
the
spirit
of
good
judgment
if
i
had
the
most
difficult
and
delicate
thing
in
the
world
to
do
i
would
entrust
it
to
mr
hargrave
i
have
seen
him
said
lady
fleetwood
i
remember
him
quite
well
in
poor
sir
john
lifetime
but
sir
john
did
not
like
him
my
dear
father
did
replied
lady
anne
and
consulted
him
on
all
his
affairs
so
you
see
i
could
not
do
better
than
marry
him
for
i
am
sure
i
want
some
one
to
manage
me
do
i
dear
lady
maria
smiled
but
lady
fleetwood
expressed
a
general
opinion
that
all
young
women
ought
to
marry
especially
if
they
had
lost
their
parents
and
after
some
more
conversation
of
the
same
rambling
kind
they
separated
and
betook
themselves
to
their
beds
chapter
xxxiv
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
time
appointed
scriven
entered
the
door
of
his
sister
house
in
square
the
door
was
opened
by
a
for
lady
fleetwood
always
took
her
own
man
with
her
one
of
maria
had
also
gone
with
the
carriage
and
the
rest
were
at
bolton
park
scriven
was
generally
as
taciturn
and
dry
towards
servants
as
towards
associates
but
on
this
occasion
as
he
was
going
a
little
out
of
his
usual
track
he
thought
fit
to
say
i
know
your
mistress
is
absent
but
she
desired
me
to
speak
with
a
man
who
is
coming
to
see
her
this
morning
at
twelve
yes
sir
i
know
replied
the
maid
with
a
curtsey
her
ladyship
told
me
before
she
went
away
more
fool
she
thought
scriven
as
the
maid
opened
the
door
of
the
and
showed
him
in
but
he
judged
that
a
rejoinder
was
requisite
and
therefore
he
said
when
the
man
comes
you
will
be
so
good
as
not
to
say
that
your
lady
is
out
but
merely
ask
him
to
walk
straight
in
here
are
the
open
no
sir
we
do
open
them
when
my
lady
is
out
of
town
said
the
maid
dropping
another
curtsey
but
i
go
and
do
it
directly
do
so
replied
scriven
have
you
got
the
key
of
the
library
no
sir
said
the
girl
looking
towards
a
door
which
led
into
a
small
apartment
behind
the
perhaps
it
open
though
my
lady
generally
locks
it
when
she
goes
away
and
she
went
forward
and
tried
the
door
but
it
was
locked
go
and
open
the
shutters
said
scriven
and
sitting
down
he
looked
attentively
at
his
boot
which
was
exceedingly
well
polished
just
as
twelve
struck
it
might
be
a
minute
or
two
before
two
men
entered
the
square
and
approached
direct
towards
the
house
they
did
not
ring
however
for
some
minutes
but
one
of
them
looked
up
and
passed
it
they
then
paused
and
seemed
to
consult
for
a
minute
or
two
gazed
round
the
square
looked
one
way
and
then
another
waited
a
minute
till
two
men
who
were
carrying
along
a
large
like
a
dead
man
on
a
stretcher
had
got
to
some
distance
and
then
turning
back
they
knocked
and
rang
at
the
street
door
in
answer
to
their
inquiry
for
lady
fleetwood
the
maid
said
pray
walk
in
her
ladyship
expected
you
i
think
yes
yes
replied
the
taller
man
who
looked
upon
this
announcement
of
the
lady
punctuality
to
her
appointment
as
a
very
favourable
indication
yes
yes
she
expects
us
and
he
strode
into
the
hall
followed
by
mingy
bowes
the
maid
shut
the
door
and
then
led
the
way
to
the
but
much
was
the
surprise
and
not
a
little
the
consternation
of
the
two
worthy
personages
when
instead
of
a
respectable
old
lady
with
a
very
delicate
complexion
and
a
fine
lace
cap
they
saw
the
tall
thin
gentlemanly
person
of
scriven
standing
exactly
before
them
and
looking
straight
in
their
faces
they
both
paused
for
an
instant
as
if
not
well
knowing
whether
to
turn
tail
and
run
away
or
not
but
scriven
decided
the
matter
by
saying
come
in
gentlemen
lady
fleetwood
was
obliged
to
go
out
of
town
and
she
therefore
begged
me
to
confer
with
you
upon
the
business
which
one
of
you
mentioned
to
her
a
day
or
two
ago
i
am
a
relation
as
much
interested
in
the
matter
as
herself
and
perhaps
more
pray
be
seated
the
maid
shut
the
door
and
the
two
men
sat
down
mingy
bowes
on
the
very
edge
of
his
chair
his
body
inclined
forward
at
an
angle
of
his
hands
upon
his
knees
and
his
huge
companion
sam
casting
himself
at
once
into
a
seat
throwing
his
long
arm
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
gazing
upwards
round
the
cornice
as
if
he
were
a
plasterer
or
an
architect
both
kept
silence
well
gentlemen
said
scriven
who
had
also
seated
himself
will
you
be
good
enough
to
explain
your
business
why
as
to
that
said
sam
in
his
usual
rude
and
abrupt
manner
i
thought
you
knew
d
d
well
what
my
business
is
did
you
tell
the
old
girl
mingy
yes
i
told
her
exactly
what
you
said
replied
mingy
bowes
well
did
she
tell
you
asked
sam
addressing
scriven
she
gave
some
explanations
replied
that
gentleman
but
you
know
ladies
heads
are
not
very
clear
and
therefore
i
would
rather
hear
the
whole
particulars
from
yourself
she
said
you
had
got
a
which
contained
papers
affecting
the
honour
and
perhaps
the
life
of
a
gentleman
who
may
probably
be
closely
connected
with
my
family
ay
that
it
cried
sam
and
i
told
him
to
tell
her
that
if
she
liked
to
come
down
handsome
i
say
nothing
about
it
but
if
she
did
i
go
and
blow
the
whole
to
scriven
and
those
are
the
people
whose
names
were
forged
indeed
said
scriven
in
his
usual
calm
and
deliberate
tone
well
the
matter
is
worthy
of
some
consideration
devilish
little
time
will
i
give
for
consideration
replied
the
brute
i
have
the
money
down
this
very
day
and
a
promise
of
it
before
i
go
or
else
i
be
off
to
scriven
and
at
once
well
well
answered
scriven
do
be
impatient
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
come
to
terms
of
some
sort
before
we
part
as
a
man
of
business
however
i
must
know
what
you
can
prove
and
what
you
can
not
before
i
agree
to
anything
there
you
fool
whispered
mingy
bowes
in
a
low
tone
i
told
you
what
you
would
do
when
you
threw
the
into
the
fire
you
the
fool
answered
sam
fiercely
and
a
d
d
fool
too
and
then
turning
to
scriven
he
added
what
you
say
is
all
fair
two
sides
to
every
bargain
so
i
tell
you
what
i
can
prove
and
then
you
can
let
me
prove
it
or
not
i
can
prove
that
a
man
going
about
here
calling
himself
colonel
middleton
is
the
very
same
man
who
ten
years
ago
went
by
the
name
of
henry
hayley
and
that
he
was
then
accused
of
committing
a
forgery
upon
scriven
and
now
i
said
the
papers
in
the
book
would
either
hang
or
save
him
for
in
it
was
jotted
down
his
own
account
of
the
whole
matter
showing
that
this
colonel
middleton
is
just
the
same
man
and
that
if
he
had
not
run
away
as
he
did
he
would
have
been
tried
for
the
forgery
and
been
hanged
for
it
too
perhaps
had
it
not
been
for
another
paper
that
was
in
the
book
pray
what
was
that
asked
scriven
why
a
paper
in
a
different
hand
replied
the
man
written
by
the
young
man
father
who
calls
himself
stephen
hayley
i
think
and
says
that
he
himself
committed
the
forgery
and
got
the
young
man
to
take
the
bill
to
the
bankers
to
be
changed
without
his
knowing
that
it
was
forged
it
a
long
story
but
then
he
goes
on
to
say
that
he
persuaded
the
young
man
to
run
away
and
take
the
blame
to
save
his
father
life
and
that
he
gives
him
that
paper
to
show
his
innocence
in
case
he
caught
scriven
mused
for
a
moment
or
two
with
a
frowning
brow
for
once
in
his
life
the
first
impression
was
a
right
one
and
had
he
acted
upon
it
he
would
have
done
justly
and
wisely
there
was
so
much
probability
in
the
story
that
he
felt
a
difficulty
in
disbelieving
it
though
he
might
wish
to
do
so
and
a
repugnance
to
pursuing
plans
incompatible
with
that
belief
but
as
he
paused
and
thought
selfishness
mastered
conscience
the
wishes
grew
more
strong
and
overpowered
belief
that
paper
must
be
a
fabrication
he
said
aloud
and
then
addressing
the
man
more
directly
he
added
have
you
got
it
let
me
see
it
i
will
return
it
to
you
again
upon
my
honour
why
no
i
have
got
it
replied
sam
i
burned
it
i
threw
it
and
the
too
into
the
fire
because
i
thought
the
d
d
fellow
they
sent
wanted
to
nab
me
then
how
do
you
dare
to
come
here
asked
scriven
when
nothing
to
show
as
proof
of
your
story
come
come
none
of
that
exclaimed
the
man
looking
at
him
fiercely
i
got
enough
to
show
that
this
henry
hayley
and
colonel
middleton
are
the
same
man
i
did
burn
them
in
the
i
was
resolved
to
keep
some
hold
on
him
so
i
took
them
out
first
while
mingy
was
gone
into
the
shop
for
the
man
he
sent
so
if
without
any
more
palaver
you
do
strike
a
bargain
and
tell
me
what
you
or
he
will
give
i
shall
be
off
to
scriven
and
directly
and
let
them
know
all
about
it
he
may
then
prove
his
innocence
or
let
it
alone
but
he
find
that
a
devilish
difficult
matter
now
the
other
burned
to
a
cinder
in
mingy
grate
can
you
show
me
those
papers
you
have
got
said
scriven
in
a
much
more
placable
tone
here
they
are
replied
the
man
taking
a
little
roll
from
his
pocket
but
unless
i
get
a
thousand
pounds
for
them
i
wo
show
them
to
any
one
till
i
show
them
to
scriven
and
well
then
show
them
to
me
replied
the
gentleman
my
name
is
scriven
and
i
am
the
person
whose
name
was
forged
the
fellow
gazed
in
his
face
with
a
look
of
horror
and
consternation
and
demanded
with
a
terrible
imprecation
then
are
you
scriven
and
i
am
the
head
of
that
house
replied
scriven
and
the
has
long
ceased
to
exist
well
then
you
have
done
me
in
a
d
d
unhandsome
manner
said
the
man
and
i
should
like
to
twist
your
neck
about
for
your
pains
i
have
done
no
such
thing
answered
scriven
i
told
you
that
i
am
lady
fleetwood
relation
which
is
true
and
that
i
am
here
to
act
for
her
which
is
true
also
moreover
if
you
will
listen
to
me
for
a
moment
you
will
see
that
although
you
will
not
get
a
thousand
pounds
from
me
upon
any
pretence
whatever
you
may
make
a
reasonable
profit
by
this
business
notwithstanding
first
understand
that
i
do
not
care
one
pin
whether
this
henry
hayley
alias
middleton
be
hanged
or
not
except
merely
for
the
sake
of
justice
he
showed
himself
exceedingly
ungrateful
to
me
and
forged
my
name
for
a
large
sum
for
that
paper
pretending
to
be
his
father
confession
is
all
a
fabrication
but
i
did
not
lose
anything
it
was
the
bankers
who
lost
and
they
offered
a
reward
of
two
hundred
pounds
for
his
apprehension
which
offer
is
still
in
force
i
offered
the
same
sum
perhaps
it
was
foolish
to
do
so
for
in
truth
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
still
i
will
not
go
back
from
my
word
and
if
you
will
follow
out
exactly
what
i
tell
you
i
may
add
a
hundred
pounds
more
in
order
to
open
my
niece
eyes
and
save
her
from
the
snare
that
this
man
has
laid
for
her
that
will
make
five
hundred
pounds
which
is
all
you
will
get
will
you
do
it
or
not
what
do
you
say
mingy
said
the
one
scoundrel
turning
to
the
other
here
sam
let
me
talk
with
you
a
bit
said
mingy
bowes
walking
towards
the
window
the
other
followed
him
and
for
nearly
ten
minutes
they
conferred
together
very
eagerly
and
in
a
low
tone
while
scriven
coolly
took
some
tablets
from
his
pockets
and
amused
himself
with
making
notes
and
adding
up
sums
at
length
they
returned
again
to
the
table
and
sam
began
to
speak
but
scriven
waved
his
hand
for
silence
and
went
on
with
his
calculations
saying
five
and
two
are
seven
and
nine
are
sixteen
and
six
are
and
seven
are
nine
and
carry
now
what
is
it
why
you
see
sir
said
sam
in
a
very
deferential
tone
greatly
impressed
with
the
merchant
coolness
i
afraid
i
ca
why
not
demanded
scriven
because
sir
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
give
evidence
said
sam
and
that
might
be
rather
ticklish
for
me
i
do
want
to
put
my
own
neck
into
a
noose
nor
to
take
a
swim
in
a
ship
at
the
expense
of
government
scriven
thought
for
a
moment
or
two
i
understand
you
he
said
at
last
in
fact
you
knocked
the
young
man
down
and
took
the
and
other
things
from
him
he
mentioned
the
fact
did
he
see
you
no
that
he
did
replied
sam
promptly
and
he
ca
prove
that
i
had
any
other
things
but
the
book
then
it
seems
to
me
the
matter
very
easy
said
scriven
let
us
be
frank
with
each
other
my
good
friend
the
case
stands
thus
you
got
the
and
he
can
prove
it
so
you
wo
help
yourself
a
bit
by
holding
back
that
fact
for
the
officers
are
after
you
by
this
time
depend
upon
it
now
by
coming
forward
and
first
proving
a
crime
against
him
you
help
yourself
very
much
for
if
convicted
of
felony
first
he
ca
give
evidence
against
you
and
he
would
have
to
prove
that
he
was
robbed
of
the
before
he
could
punish
you
for
taking
it
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
get
up
a
good
story
as
to
how
you
came
to
have
the
book
said
mingy
bowes
ca
you
say
you
found
it
upon
the
common
that
same
night
i
dare
say
you
put
away
all
the
other
things
by
this
time
said
scriven
ay
they
are
safe
enough
answered
sam
well
then
your
having
nothing
else
but
the
which
would
be
valueless
to
any
who
did
not
examine
the
papers
will
corroborate
your
story
observed
scriven
for
people
may
naturally
conclude
that
those
who
took
the
things
threw
away
the
on
the
common
when
they
found
there
was
no
money
in
it
sam
looked
at
mingy
bowes
and
mingy
nodded
his
head
approvingly
saying
that
do
i
think
sam
the
only
way
of
saving
yourself
and
getting
the
money
said
scriven
is
to
go
at
the
thing
boldly
the
very
fact
of
your
making
the
charge
will
be
a
presumption
in
your
favour
people
will
all
say
of
course
that
you
would
not
have
ventured
to
do
so
if
you
had
taken
the
thing
unlawfully
and
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
help
you
you
may
depend
upon
it
but
remember
you
must
act
according
to
my
directions
and
i
will
answer
for
it
that
no
harm
shall
happen
to
you
hang
it
sir
said
the
man
one
so
often
hears
it
said
harm
shall
happen
to
you
and
then
a
great
deal
does
that
i
am
half
afraid
what
else
have
you
to
propose
asked
scriven
in
his
driest
tone
if
you
reject
good
counsel
you
must
have
some
scheme
or
plan
already
formed
i
know
not
what
it
is
but
think
it
somewhat
more
than
dangerous
whatever
it
may
be
for
i
can
see
no
way
of
extricating
yourself
but
that
which
has
been
named
lord
bless
you
i
no
scheme
sir
said
the
man
who
to
say
the
truth
was
a
good
deal
bewildered
by
the
new
point
of
view
in
which
the
question
had
been
placed
before
him
what
do
you
say
mingy
mingy
bowes
shook
his
head
doubtfully
without
venturing
a
reply
and
scriven
seeing
clearly
that
the
unexpected
discovery
of
his
name
together
with
the
disclosure
of
all
their
secrets
had
as
it
were
left
the
men
no
choice
but
to
follow
his
plan
or
to
fly
thought
he
might
as
well
throw
in
the
last
inducement
as
he
would
have
done
in
selling
one
or
two
thousand
bales
of
goods
by
giving
a
bale
or
two
over
and
above
the
bargain
you
will
remember
sir
he
said
addressing
mingy
that
in
advising
your
friend
i
myself
have
no
choice
in
this
matter
if
he
enables
me
to
break
off
the
match
between
this
man
and
my
niece
by
coming
frankly
forward
it
will
of
course
be
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
for
me
to
help
him
to
the
utmost
of
my
ability
but
if
on
the
contrary
he
holds
back
i
must
take
part
with
colonel
middleton
and
must
do
what
i
can
to
prove
my
niece
husband
worthy
of
her
affection
that
to
say
you
hang
me
if
you
could
replied
sam
undoubtedly
answered
scriven
in
his
usual
dry
manner
well
that
hard
said
the
man
but
you
seem
to
have
got
me
in
a
cleft
stick
and
so
i
suppose
i
must
do
what
you
please
ay
that
right
replied
scriven
i
tell
you
conscientiously
and
upon
my
honour
that
i
think
it
the
only
way
to
save
yourself
and
then
you
get
five
hundred
pounds
into
the
bargain
you
know
i
do
it
or
i
be
hanged
said
the
man
warming
enthusiastically
at
the
thought
of
the
money
they
can
but
give
me
what
they
call
a
in
the
colony
and
i
do
much
care
for
that
come
it
a
bargain
i
help
you
to
fix
the
young
man
so
that
the
beaks
ca
have
the
least
doubt
in
the
world
that
he
is
the
chap
and
whenever
he
fixed
i
to
have
the
five
hundred
there
the
offer
of
a
reward
by
stolterforth
and
the
bankers
who
cashed
the
bill
said
scriven
so
you
see
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
do
what
we
propose
as
soon
as
possible
now
let
me
see
the
papers
because
there
can
be
no
use
in
concealing
them
there
they
are
replied
sam
look
you
here
he
has
been
careful
enough
but
he
says
in
this
one
which
looks
like
a
sort
of
that
he
determined
at
a
certain
time
to
go
back
to
england
under
the
name
of
colonel
middleton
scriven
looked
over
the
papers
carefully
and
as
great
an
expression
of
satisfaction
appeared
upon
his
countenance
as
he
ever
suffered
to
take
possession
of
his
usually
inanimate
features
that
all
right
he
said
turning
one
down
now
if
nothing
to
upset
the
scheme
you
get
your
five
hundred
pounds
to
a
certainty
and
though
that
is
not
a
thousand
it
is
better
than
nothing
a
devil
of
a
deal
said
the
man
delighted
with
the
notion
of
the
money
but
you
have
looked
at
the
one
next
to
it
it
got
something
in
it
too
that
is
something
but
i
think
now
mingy
as
this
is
settled
we
had
better
pack
up
our
tools
and
be
off
no
no
stay
said
the
other
there
are
two
or
three
things
more
to
be
settled
you
must
come
to
me
at
six
this
evening
when
we
can
finally
arrange
all
our
plans
and
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
not
go
to
any
nor
to
any
of
your
usual
haunts
for
depend
upon
it
this
colonel
middleton
as
he
is
called
has
set
many
a
trap
for
you
i
do
think
he
dare
said
the
man
being
quite
sure
i
know
such
a
deal
about
him
oh
he
try
to
have
the
first
word
as
well
as
you
replied
scriven
but
we
must
prevent
him
he
is
gone
down
to
northumberland
for
a
day
or
two
perhaps
to
keep
out
of
the
way
rather
than
anything
else
and
the
best
plan
for
us
to
follow
will
be
to
go
after
him
at
once
pounce
upon
him
in
the
country
give
him
in
charge
and
if
possible
get
the
country
magistrates
who
know
nothing
about
him
to
commit
him
you
come
to
me
at
six
as
i
have
said
and
in
the
mean
time
i
will
go
away
to
the
and
get
the
notes
of
the
former
proceedings
now
for
the
present
but
do
not
think
that
you
can
bolt
and
leave
me
in
the
lurch
by
going
away
out
of
town
or
out
of
england
for
i
shall
have
one
or
two
sharp
hands
looking
after
you
and
depend
upon
it
wherever
you
went
they
would
find
you
out
oh
i
sha
bolt
replied
sam
you
have
got
me
under
the
pitchfork
and
must
do
what
you
like
i
be
at
your
house
by
six
if
you
tell
me
where
it
is
willingly
answered
scriven
writing
the
name
of
the
street
and
the
number
of
the
house
down
in
pencil
you
find
me
there
at
six
precisely
but
remember
i
very
punctual
and
i
do
not
wait
for
any
one
i
be
there
to
the
minute
answered
the
man
for
i
nothing
else
to
do
but
i
suppose
i
come
upon
honour
and
that
nobody
will
try
to
stop
me
from
coming
away
again
neither
by
any
fault
nor
any
indiscretion
of
mine
answered
scriven
but
you
must
take
care
in
the
mean
time
for
fear
they
should
shut
you
up
if
you
and
i
can
set
off
to
northumberland
at
once
while
the
iron
is
hot
you
will
be
out
of
the
way
yourself
and
we
shall
take
this
lad
quite
unprepared
and
have
him
before
a
justice
ere
he
knows
what
he
doing
it
must
depend
upon
circumstances
however
i
mean
from
what
i
see
in
the
city
if
all
right
and
if
i
can
go
away
we
will
set
out
this
very
night
or
morning
that
all
right
sir
that
all
right
said
sam
i
be
there
to
the
minute
and
now
i
suppose
we
had
better
go
away
for
i
see
got
your
hat
in
your
hand
and
i
suppose
your
time
short
very
considering
all
i
have
to
do
replied
scriven
and
as
i
know
this
matter
is
important
the
sooner
it
is
got
through
the
better
certainly
sir
certainly
answered
sam
you
sha
wait
for
me
so
good
morning
to
you
scriven
did
not
half
like
to
let
him
go
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
had
once
thought
of
giving
him
in
charge
to
a
constable
but
that
he
saw
might
spoil
all
his
plans
and
he
abandoned
the
idea
directly
there
were
no
securities
to
be
taken
of
such
a
man
except
his
fears
or
his
interests
and
both
of
these
scriven
imagined
he
had
to
a
certain
degree
enlisted
on
his
side
nevertheless
when
he
saw
him
depart
he
felt
a
good
many
unpleasant
doubts
as
to
whether
he
should
ever
see
his
face
again
unless
at
the
bar
of
some
chapter
xxxv
there
was
a
morning
of
longings
at
milford
castle
something
somebody
was
evidently
expected
it
began
at
the
lady
anne
was
down
first
but
maria
had
been
up
earliest
and
when
she
at
length
entered
the
cheerful
little
room
she
found
her
fair
hostess
gazing
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
a
heavy
dew
had
fallen
during
the
night
and
it
was
lying
filmy
and
bright
upon
the
lawns
and
slopes
of
the
park
like
the
misty
radiance
with
which
fancy
invests
the
unseen
things
of
life
was
it
at
that
dewy
silvering
lady
anne
was
gazing
so
intently
or
at
that
deep
shadowy
wood
the
tops
of
whose
ancient
trees
were
just
seen
above
the
rise
the
road
dipping
down
into
them
as
if
to
take
a
bath
in
their
cool
verdure
it
was
the
road
towards
belford
and
her
eyes
were
anxiously
turned
in
that
direction
perhaps
her
thoughts
also
maria
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
and
then
twining
their
arms
together
they
both
stood
at
the
window
and
both
thought
for
nearly
five
minutes
without
speaking
a
word
at
length
lady
anne
said
it
will
be
a
hot
day
and
then
she
laughed
at
herself
for
talking
so
wide
of
her
thoughts
and
gazing
into
maria
lovely
eyes
with
a
faint
smile
she
added
henry
can
not
be
here
till
the
day
is
at
the
hottest
maria
smiled
in
return
but
it
was
a
faint
fluttering
smile
in
which
fear
and
hope
were
blended
for
she
was
very
very
anxious
about
him
she
loved
his
confident
and
hopeful
manner
had
not
communicated
courage
to
her
woman
heart
and
many
an
uneasy
and
apprehensive
hour
had
she
passed
when
thinking
of
the
difficulties
of
his
situation
oh
how
we
love
that
which
excites
our
anxiety
how
the
chasing
hopes
and
fears
the
cares
the
watchfulness
bind
the
object
of
them
to
our
heart
and
all
these
during
the
last
few
days
of
her
short
existence
had
maria
felt
intensely
for
henry
hayley
whenever
he
was
absent
from
her
for
any
time
she
was
full
of
apprehensions
for
him
she
expected
to
hear
that
he
had
been
arrested
that
the
struggle
which
she
dreaded
had
commenced
that
the
game
of
life
or
death
was
staked
and
though
she
might
preserve
the
external
appearance
of
calmness
yet
was
the
poor
girl
sadly
moved
within
maria
would
not
reply
to
her
friend
words
for
she
feared
her
own
but
nevertheless
she
was
apparently
calmer
during
that
morning
than
lady
anne
herself
her
manner
was
composed
she
spoke
she
answered
quietly
and
it
was
only
by
an
anxious
look
or
a
slight
start
when
she
thought
she
heard
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
that
she
betrayed
how
much
she
felt
at
heart
lady
anne
on
the
contrary
though
her
usual
april
mood
was
still
present
was
assuredly
more
inclined
to
be
on
the
showery
side
of
the
sweet
month
than
on
the
sunshiny
sometimes
she
would
talk
wildly
and
laugh
gaily
but
at
others
she
would
sink
into
profound
fits
of
thought
gaze
forth
into
the
vacant
air
and
answer
questions
quite
astray
even
lady
fleetwood
seemed
in
a
degree
to
feel
the
irritating
effects
of
expectation
once
in
the
middle
of
breakfast
without
a
word
having
been
uttered
regarding
travels
or
travellers
she
suddenly
lifted
her
head
and
said
i
wonder
at
what
hour
they
will
arrive
and
some
time
afterwards
when
walking
for
a
moment
on
the
terrace
with
maria
she
observed
in
the
same
abrupt
manner
they
will
have
a
fine
day
for
their
arrival
at
all
events
as
the
day
wore
on
and
the
hour
at
which
they
might
be
expected
passed
maria
grew
more
thoughtful
more
anxious
more
grave
and
lady
anne
after
watching
her
friend
face
for
a
moment
said
come
maria
this
will
not
do
let
us
go
and
amuse
ourselves
in
some
way
we
will
walk
down
to
the
steward
see
the
hens
and
chickens
talk
about
lambs
and
be
quite
pastoral
nay
we
shall
not
be
absent
when
they
arrive
for
i
will
set
a
boy
upon
the
tower
to
watch
the
road
and
whenever
he
sees
a
carriage
coming
he
shall
run
up
my
old
flag
the
top
of
the
tower
can
be
seen
from
the
steward
house
they
tell
me
and
as
it
is
only
and
the
carriage
can
be
seen
two
miles
off
we
shall
get
back
in
time
maria
made
no
objection
they
went
down
to
the
steward
house
and
they
did
talk
about
chickens
and
lambs
and
were
quite
pastoral
but
time
wore
on
no
flag
was
displayed
and
they
returned
to
the
house
somewhat
sadly
they
found
lady
fleetwood
seated
in
the
working
at
the
purse
her
penelope
web
but
the
old
lady
face
was
very
grave
too
and
to
tell
the
truth
her
imagination
had
gone
careering
in
the
same
direction
as
maria
when
she
looked
up
then
and
saw
all
the
anxiety
that
was
written
in
her
niece
fair
face
the
milk
of
human
kindness
in
her
bosom
overflowed
and
she
must
needs
comfort
her
my
dear
maria
she
said
do
not
make
yourself
so
uneasy
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
about
and
what
you
fear
but
there
is
really
no
cause
for
alarm
my
brothers
conduct
towards
colonel
middleton
was
very
strange
that
day
at
dinner
i
suppose
because
he
thought
we
had
shown
a
want
of
confidence
in
him
but
i
saw
him
just
before
we
left
town
and
he
was
quite
kind
about
the
whole
business
assuring
me
he
would
do
the
best
he
could
for
our
friend
even
if
it
should
turn
out
that
he
is
the
person
whom
we
all
suspect
he
is
for
i
told
him
all
i
knew
and
all
i
fancied
good
heaven
exclaimed
lady
anne
to
him
to
my
uncle
demanded
maria
with
a
look
of
consternation
clasping
her
hands
together
to
him
did
you
tell
all
the
very
last
man
to
whom
a
word
should
have
been
spoken
till
all
was
settled
well
my
dear
child
said
lady
fleetwood
very
much
distressed
i
did
it
i
am
sure
with
the
best
intentions
oh
your
best
intentions
your
best
intentions
my
dear
aunt
exclaimed
maria
judging
her
uncle
character
better
than
her
aunt
and
seeing
with
anguish
all
the
fatal
consequences
which
might
ensue
but
almost
as
she
spoke
the
roll
of
carriage
wheels
was
heard
and
then
some
vehicle
or
vehicles
dashed
up
to
the
doors
it
could
not
be
resisted
under
the
circumstances
in
which
they
were
all
proprieties
and
decorums
were
forgotten
and
the
three
ladies
by
one
impulse
ran
to
the
windows
there
were
two
travelling
carriages
on
the
terrace
and
the
first
person
who
sprang
out
was
henry
hayley
maria
had
resisted
strongly
expectation
anxiety
even
the
terror
of
her
aunt
communication
had
not
drawn
a
tear
from
her
but
when
she
saw
him
whom
she
loved
and
feared
for
there
before
her
safe
and
well
the
bright
drops
rose
up
in
her
eyes
was
it
wonderful
that
she
should
feel
so
perhaps
not
and
yet
the
most
wonderful
things
that
i
know
of
in
the
world
are
the
emotions
of
the
human
heart
surpassingly
mysterious
we
are
habituated
to
them
we
feel
or
we
mark
them
in
others
every
day
and
our
wonder
ceases
but
who
can
account
for
them
whence
do
they
arise
in
what
deep
well
of
the
soul
have
they
their
source
take
any
emotion
you
will
and
drive
it
home
you
will
be
puzzled
to
trace
it
to
the
end
we
say
it
is
natural
for
man
to
have
a
fondness
for
this
a
repugnance
to
that
but
in
so
saying
we
assume
the
whole
groundwork
we
assert
but
do
not
explain
why
did
maria
so
feel
for
the
man
before
her
why
had
she
feared
for
him
as
she
was
incapable
of
fearing
for
herself
why
would
she
at
that
moment
have
willingly
sacrificed
her
life
for
him
why
was
the
sense
of
rejoicing
so
overpowering
when
the
immediate
anxiety
for
him
was
at
an
end
how
had
he
contrived
in
so
short
a
space
to
change
the
whole
current
of
her
feelings
to
concentrate
as
it
were
every
thought
and
affection
which
had
previously
ranged
wide
and
far
diffused
over
all
things
that
surrounded
her
upon
himself
alone
to
transmute
his
interests
into
her
interests
and
to
bind
their
future
fates
together
by
a
strong
and
indissoluble
tie
inseparable
for
ever
so
it
was
however
and
at
that
moment
as
maria
stood
at
the
window
and
saw
him
spring
from
the
carriage
she
felt
that
it
was
so
more
than
she
had
ever
felt
before
in
a
few
moments
the
whole
party
were
assembled
in
the
but
these
few
moments
had
been
enough
to
calm
the
minds
of
those
who
had
been
waiting
to
that
point
at
least
where
joy
is
unmingled
with
agitation
lady
fleetwood
was
delighted
to
see
everybody
but
especially
colonel
middleton
to
whom
she
was
now
profuse
in
kindness
and
attention
in
order
to
make
up
for
the
little
which
her
niece
words
showed
her
she
had
committed
she
was
the
kindest
woman
in
the
world
but
she
did
not
see
or
she
would
not
see
that
colonel
middleton
whole
thoughts
were
upon
maria
and
that
the
first
five
minutes
were
in
some
sort
maria
due
lady
fleetwood
talked
to
him
she
inquired
after
his
journey
as
if
he
had
been
a
sick
man
or
lame
she
assured
him
more
than
once
how
glad
she
was
to
see
him
in
northumberland
as
if
she
had
utterly
despaired
of
seeing
him
there
at
all
and
she
effectually
contrived
to
prevent
him
for
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
after
his
arrival
from
doing
more
than
merely
shaking
hands
with
her
he
loved
poor
maria
bore
it
with
the
fortitude
of
a
martyr
and
even
lady
anne
did
not
venture
to
interfere
lest
by
coming
to
her
rescue
she
should
only
make
matters
worse
she
was
like
the
man
who
saw
his
companion
carried
away
by
a
tiger
and
did
not
dare
to
fire
lest
he
should
kill
his
friend
instead
of
the
brute
winkworth
still
had
his
sleeve
cut
open
and
his
arm
in
a
sling
but
he
looked
exceedingly
brisk
and
gay
and
with
his
mixture
of
odd
eccentricity
and
courtesy
paid
his
compliments
to
lady
anne
congratulated
her
upon
having
so
fine
a
park
in
which
to
use
his
own
expression
her
deer
her
horse
and
her
wits
might
range
about
at
liberty
and
then
turning
to
brice
who
was
by
this
time
in
the
room
left
his
fair
hostess
to
converse
with
charles
uninterrupted
at
length
however
compassion
moved
him
and
in
order
to
draw
the
fire
from
colonel
middleton
he
advanced
and
began
chatting
to
lady
fleetwood
in
a
gay
and
easy
strain
i
feel
what
it
is
to
be
old
my
dear
madam
he
said
here
you
have
not
spoken
two
words
to
me
while
this
gay
young
gentleman
monopolises
you
entirely
now
that
is
not
right
i
claim
my
share
and
here
i
come
to
take
possession
of
it
and
he
seated
himself
beside
her
on
the
sofa
henry
instantly
turned
to
maria
and
how
they
managed
it
i
do
not
know
but
in
the
space
of
less
than
a
minute
they
were
standing
talking
to
each
other
at
one
of
the
windows
it
was
a
difficult
man
oe
uvre
to
effect
in
the
presence
of
such
an
active
adversary
as
lady
fleetwood
but
it
was
accomplished
nevertheless
with
such
skill
and
precaution
that
dear
lady
fleetwood
did
not
remark
what
they
were
doing
nor
make
any
attack
upon
either
flank
as
they
retreated
had
she
seen
them
there
were
a
thousand
chances
to
one
that
she
would
have
done
so
she
would
have
asked
colonel
middleton
some
question
or
called
maria
to
talk
with
winkworth
or
worse
than
all
would
have
whispered
to
her
niece
to
explain
to
her
niece
lover
that
what
she
had
said
to
scriven
was
said
entirely
with
the
best
intentions
five
or
six
pleasant
minutes
did
henry
and
maria
pass
in
low
earnest
conversation
but
at
length
the
latter
said
aloud
oh
yes
i
dare
say
we
can
we
have
only
been
a
very
little
way
and
then
turning
towards
the
spot
where
lady
anne
stood
she
said
colonel
middleton
is
proposing
a
walk
in
the
park
if
you
are
not
tired
anne
not
at
all
replied
lady
anne
let
us
all
go
and
take
a
ramble
it
is
nearly
as
new
to
me
as
to
any
of
you
for
i
have
not
been
here
before
since
i
was
three
years
old
and
to
say
truth
i
remember
much
about
it
come
bonnets
and
shawls
and
let
us
go
gentlemen
the
butler
will
show
you
the
apartments
prepared
for
you
which
i
trust
will
be
found
tolerably
comfortable
although
when
i
arrived
here
myself
i
felt
almost
in
despair
lest
that
epithet
should
never
be
applicable
to
the
house
again
of
one
thing
however
i
can
assure
you
namely
there
are
no
rats
for
they
were
starved
out
two
years
ago
and
emigrated
to
some
other
country
thus
saying
she
tripped
away
maria
followed
lady
fleetwood
too
declaring
that
a
walk
would
be
very
delightful
went
to
get
ready
do
you
come
mr
winkworth
asked
colonel
middleton
in
a
somewhat
anxious
tone
winkworth
looked
at
him
ruefully
i
had
not
meditated
such
a
feat
he
said
but
i
of
a
disposition
and
the
most
gallant
man
in
nature
as
you
all
know
therefore
as
our
excellent
friend
lady
fleetwood
is
going
and
as
without
me
there
would
be
but
two
gentlemen
to
three
ladies
i
must
ensure
that
one
is
not
without
an
attendant
pray
charles
can
you
tell
me
whether
fox
who
wrote
the
was
not
a
northumberland
man
i
think
at
all
events
i
should
be
added
to
his
book
as
a
sort
of
supplementary
martyr
but
here
is
the
butler
to
show
us
our
rooms
and
i
will
hasten
to
get
ready
the
chamber
to
which
colonel
middleton
was
shown
was
a
large
room
hung
with
tapestry
through
which
protruded
several
gilt
iron
brackets
supporting
old
family
pictures
some
were
very
good
and
some
in
an
inferior
style
of
art
though
probably
the
best
which
could
be
found
at
the
period
when
each
picture
was
painted
there
were
two
vandykes
and
the
rest
were
by
kneller
lely
and
their
disciples
but
they
all
had
an
interest
for
colonel
middleton
who
went
round
from
the
one
to
the
other
stopping
a
moment
or
two
before
each
and
gazing
on
the
mute
and
motionless
countenances
to
me
and
i
believe
to
many
other
men
there
is
a
strange
fascination
about
old
family
portraits
i
could
gaze
upon
the
effigies
of
the
dead
for
many
an
hour
striving
to
read
in
the
lines
and
features
the
life
the
fate
the
character
of
the
being
there
represented
such
seemed
to
be
the
feelings
of
the
young
officer
as
he
walked
round
he
commented
however
in
his
thoughts
upon
the
countenances
before
him
they
have
been
a
handsome
race
he
said
to
himself
with
a
strong
family
likeness
in
all
the
men
all
more
or
less
like
lady
anne
too
here
in
one
feature
there
in
another
and
then
again
in
the
expression
this
one
in
the
formal
dress
of
the
last
century
is
perhaps
less
like
than
any
and
yet
he
must
have
been
nearer
in
relationship
than
the
rest
he
looks
stern
and
harsh
a
man
of
a
strong
will
and
fiery
temper
as
he
thus
thought
his
eye
rested
upon
a
little
gilt
scroll
at
the
bottom
of
the
frame
and
he
there
saw
written
william
earl
of
milford
born
died
it
was
the
year
during
which
he
himself
had
come
down
to
milford
castle
in
search
of
the
son
of
that
very
man
the
inscription
awakened
another
train
of
thought
and
seating
himself
in
a
chair
he
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
gave
way
to
meditation
he
was
roused
the
moment
after
by
some
of
lady
anne
servants
bringing
up
his
luggage
and
raising
his
head
he
asked
pray
has
my
servant
arrived
he
was
to
come
down
by
the
mail
no
sir
replied
the
man
he
has
not
come
yet
shall
i
put
these
in
the
if
you
please
said
colonel
middleton
where
is
the
it
is
here
sir
said
the
servant
turning
up
a
corner
of
the
tapestry
and
opening
a
small
door
which
displayed
a
little
room
into
which
the
sun
was
streaming
warm
and
bright
it
is
strange
what
trains
of
thought
very
insignificant
circumstances
will
produce
the
sight
of
that
small
but
cheerful
chamber
compared
with
the
large
and
gloomy
one
in
which
he
stood
struck
the
young
officer
much
and
he
said
to
himself
thus
it
is
often
with
human
fate
the
narrow
and
confined
sphere
of
humble
life
is
often
gay
and
happy
while
the
wider
and
loftier
one
of
wealth
and
station
is
cold
gloomy
and
cheerless
the
next
moment
he
heard
the
voice
of
charles
marston
calling
him
and
going
they
set
out
upon
their
walk
winkworth
managed
admirably
one
would
almost
have
supposed
him
a
dowager
so
admirably
did
he
keep
lady
fleetwood
in
play
while
the
younger
party
roamed
on
before
he
walked
slowly
too
which
is
a
great
faculty
in
such
circumstances
and
as
lady
fleetwood
herself
was
not
generally
disposed
to
walk
fast
it
suited
her
very
well
colonel
middleton
is
an
old
friend
of
yours
i
find
winkworth
said
lady
fleetwood
as
they
went
on
have
you
known
him
many
years
not
many
according
to
the
almanac
my
dear
madam
replied
the
old
gentleman
but
a
great
many
according
to
the
computation
of
the
mind
i
look
upon
it
my
dear
lady
fleetwood
he
continued
in
a
moralising
tone
that
thoughts
words
and
actions
are
the
real
measures
of
time
and
that
the
sun
rising
or
setting
the
mere
whirling
round
of
the
great
on
which
we
creep
about
has
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
it
according
therefore
to
my
way
of
computing
i
have
known
colonel
middleton
a
great
many
years
and
ten
times
as
long
as
i
have
known
some
men
with
whom
i
was
before
he
was
born
you
understand
me
she
did
not
in
the
least
but
she
replied
oh
yes
you
mean
that
you
have
known
him
many
years
but
that
you
have
lost
sight
of
him
not
so
replied
winkworth
it
is
not
many
months
since
i
first
made
his
acquaintance
but
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
him
in
that
time
have
heard
much
of
him
from
friends
of
longer
standing
and
a
more
honourable
gentlemanly
man
does
not
exist
oh
dear
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
why
so
demanded
winkworth
did
you
doubt
it
oh
no
not
in
the
least
replied
lady
fleetwood
i
never
did
i
can
assure
you
not
even
when
for
once
in
her
life
lady
fleetwood
checked
herself
in
full
career
she
was
on
the
highway
to
tell
winkworth
everything
she
knew
of
henry
hayley
history
and
all
the
present
as
well
as
all
the
past
was
about
to
be
detailed
for
the
benefit
of
his
companion
when
she
recollected
herself
and
held
her
tongue
though
the
bridle
was
hardly
strong
enough
to
keep
in
that
very
horse
winkworth
did
not
seem
to
have
much
curiosity
for
he
instantly
changed
the
subject
saying
what
a
beautiful
park
this
is
one
does
not
expect
to
find
such
a
spot
in
so
remote
a
part
of
the
country
lady
anne
fortune
must
be
very
large
oh
dear
yes
replied
lady
fleetwood
her
mother
had
nearly
eight
thousand
of
her
own
and
lord
milford
had
a
very
large
property
his
father
was
a
strange
recluse
sort
of
man
spent
very
little
himself
and
allowed
his
son
a
small
income
for
a
young
nobleman
until
he
married
a
rich
banker
daughter
i
believe
he
had
not
more
than
fifteen
or
sixteen
hundred
allowed
him
and
he
was
rather
extravagant
too
in
his
habits
so
that
he
was
a
good
deal
in
debt
at
one
time
people
thought
the
old
earl
would
have
left
everything
he
could
away
from
him
for
he
was
a
sad
tyrant
and
quarrelled
with
his
son
very
often
but
then
the
young
lord
pleased
him
by
his
marriage
and
everything
went
well
after
that
they
say
the
old
man
saved
at
least
of
his
income
every
year
living
down
here
amongst
these
hills
the
whole
year
long
like
an
old
rook
in
the
top
of
an
he
died
of
some
disease
of
the
heart
it
is
said
i
should
think
so
replied
winkworth
drily
but
it
does
not
seem
to
have
been
hereditary
or
at
all
events
it
became
extinct
in
that
branch
the
excellent
lady
would
in
all
probability
have
contrived
to
be
puzzled
with
this
reply
had
not
a
little
man
oe
uvre
of
the
attracted
her
attention
and
interested
her
feelings
hitherto
maria
and
lady
anne
had
been
walking
on
arm
in
arm
with
colonel
middleton
by
the
side
of
the
former
and
charles
marston
by
the
side
of
the
latter
when
suddenly
to
lady
fleetwood
infinite
surprise
lady
anne
disengaged
herself
from
her
fair
friend
went
round
and
took
colonel
middleton
arm
then
pointing
with
her
parasol
to
the
right
she
walked
away
with
him
leaving
charles
marston
sauntering
on
by
maria
side
dear
me
said
lady
fleetwood
lady
anne
is
really
very
strange
let
us
go
on
and
overtake
them
i
am
afraid
maria
will
feel
hurt
hurt
why
asked
winkworth
quietly
and
lady
fleetwood
feeling
the
difficulty
of
explanation
did
as
all
weak
and
many
cunning
people
do
insinuated
what
she
did
not
choose
to
say
by
replying
with
a
meaning
look
oh
there
may
be
reasons
mr
winkworth
at
the
same
time
she
walked
on
at
a
pace
which
was
very
quick
for
her
but
which
failed
to
overtake
charles
and
maria
who
talking
together
earnestly
and
apparently
very
confidentially
took
their
way
in
a
direction
quite
opposite
to
that
which
had
been
followed
by
their
fair
hostess
and
colonel
middleton
upon
observing
these
indications
lady
fleetwood
paused
and
hesitated
a
new
solution
of
many
difficulties
presented
itself
to
hope
and
imagination
what
if
charles
and
maria
were
to
marry
after
all
she
thought
it
might
not
be
quite
fair
indeed
to
colonel
middleton
but
still
here
he
had
voluntarily
gone
away
with
another
lady
almost
as
if
to
avoid
maria
and
her
cousin
and
the
worthy
aunt
gradually
slackened
her
pace
saying
well
it
does
not
much
matter
oh
lady
fleetwood
lady
fleetwood
had
you
but
been
contented
in
everything
to
take
all
matters
as
easily
as
you
did
in
this
instance
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
for
you
and
all
your
friends
and
relations
soon
after
the
excellent
lady
and
her
companion
reached
the
top
of
a
small
hill
perhaps
a
barrow
from
the
summit
of
which
a
great
part
of
the
park
was
visible
and
there
she
saw
lady
anne
and
colonel
middleton
walking
slowly
along
towards
the
deep
pines
through
which
the
private
road
to
milford
castle
from
belford
passed
in
its
way
up
to
the
house
suddenly
just
emerging
from
the
trees
upon
the
road
appeared
two
men
who
as
soon
as
they
perceived
lady
anne
and
her
companion
quitted
the
road
as
if
to
meet
the
two
others
and
if
such
was
their
intention
they
succeeded
for
the
lady
of
milford
and
her
guests
went
straight
forward
towards
them
and
one
of
the
strangers
advanced
pulling
off
his
hat
with
a
low
bow
a
moment
or
two
after
the
young
lady
left
her
companion
with
the
two
men
and
walked
leisurely
away
towards
the
house
lady
fleetwood
was
puzzled
she
could
not
make
out
what
it
all
meant
and
she
expressed
her
surprise
to
winkworth
saying
i
wonder
what
the
matter
had
we
not
better
go
and
see
i
think
not
my
dear
lady
replied
winkworth
there
can
be
nothing
of
any
importance
the
matter
or
lady
anne
would
not
leave
the
party
so
quietly
besides
if
i
am
not
very
much
mistaken
one
of
those
men
is
colonel
middleton
valet
the
figure
is
just
of
his
height
and
appearance
as
the
next
best
step
lady
fleetwood
judged
it
would
be
better
to
return
to
the
house
immediately
thinking
that
there
at
least
she
should
get
information
but
she
was
disappointed
for
though
she
sought
lady
anne
as
soon
as
she
reached
milford
castle
the
young
lady
had
betaken
herself
to
her
own
room
and
the
elder
did
not
venture
to
intrude
upon
her
privacy
chapter
xxxvi
the
rang
in
milford
castle
but
before
its
iron
tongue
had
told
the
guests
to
make
ready
for
the
great
of
the
day
all
of
them
had
sought
their
chambers
and
lady
anne
mellent
was
nearly
dressed
five
minutes
after
she
sent
her
maid
to
knock
at
colonel
middleton
door
and
tell
him
that
she
was
going
down
and
would
be
glad
to
speak
with
him
in
the
as
soon
as
he
was
ready
the
maid
thought
it
rather
strange
although
she
was
well
accustomed
to
her
mistress
various
oddities
for
though
she
knew
lady
anne
to
be
very
eccentric
yet
she
had
never
before
suspected
her
of
coquetting
with
any
one
with
abigail
penetration
she
had
discovered
by
some
means
or
another
that
charles
marston
was
a
favoured
suitor
and
now
to
be
sent
to
tell
a
young
handsome
man
to
make
haste
in
dressing
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
with
her
mistress
before
any
one
else
was
down
shocked
her
ideas
of
propriety
very
much
pounds
per
annum
and
perquisites
however
are
better
than
all
the
proprieties
in
the
world
and
accordingly
she
did
as
she
was
bid
but
few
minutes
elapsed
before
colonel
middleton
was
in
the
the
maid
ear
was
certainly
too
near
the
keyhole
within
five
minutes
after
but
she
could
hear
nothing
except
the
indistinct
buzz
of
a
low
but
eager
conversation
she
then
tried
what
one
sense
could
do
to
make
up
for
the
defect
of
another
and
applied
her
eye
to
the
aperture
which
had
refused
intelligence
to
her
ear
she
had
the
whole
farther
end
of
the
room
before
her
but
to
her
surprise
there
she
saw
colonel
middleton
standing
with
his
back
against
one
of
the
and
lady
anne
near
him
leaning
upon
a
large
carved
and
gilt
chair
while
good
brice
sat
writing
a
note
at
a
table
much
more
in
advance
a
moment
after
a
carriage
drove
up
and
the
maid
ran
away
just
catching
a
sight
of
the
velvet
coat
of
hargrave
as
he
entered
the
door
with
stately
step
the
old
gentleman
followed
the
servant
who
admitted
him
to
the
and
was
met
joyously
by
lady
anne
who
said
i
am
glad
you
have
come
and
have
come
soon
did
you
suppose
i
would
break
my
written
word
fair
châtelaine
asked
the
old
gentleman
in
a
somewhat
reproachful
tone
have
i
been
true
to
a
velvet
coat
and
a
queue
for
so
many
years
to
have
my
faith
doubted
no
no
said
lady
anne
but
i
wish
particularly
to
introduce
you
to
this
gentleman
colonel
middleton
who
though
magnanimously
prepared
to
fight
his
own
battles
against
a
very
formidable
enemy
has
listened
to
my
persuasions
and
is
going
to
take
you
into
his
councils
and
solicit
your
advice
and
assistance
there
go
with
him
henry
into
the
library
tell
him
the
whole
story
and
the
intelligence
you
have
received
of
the
machinations
against
you
while
she
was
speaking
hargrave
from
time
to
time
looked
with
a
somewhat
inquiring
glance
from
her
face
to
that
of
henry
hayley
and
then
a
faint
smile
came
upon
his
fine
though
faded
features
no
no
cried
lady
anne
laughing
as
she
remarked
it
you
are
quite
mistaken
he
is
not
the
man
and
a
great
deal
handsomer
but
you
will
hear
all
about
it
in
a
minute
for
the
whole
must
come
out
now
and
you
will
know
the
why
and
the
wherefore
come
with
us
said
henry
addressing
her
we
shall
need
you
in
our
council
indeed
well
then
dear
brice
said
the
beautiful
girl
if
lady
fleetwood
and
the
rest
come
down
say
that
i
will
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
lady
fleetwood
did
come
down
and
then
the
other
members
of
the
party
one
after
another
and
to
each
brice
delivered
lady
message
i
wonder
where
colonel
middleton
is
said
lady
fleetwood
at
length
after
winkworth
who
was
the
last
had
been
down
five
minutes
he
is
with
lady
anne
in
the
library
said
brice
simply
and
lady
fleetwood
fair
and
delicate
complexion
showed
a
blush
as
deep
as
if
she
had
been
a
young
girl
just
caught
in
attempting
to
elope
maria
remarked
her
aunt
colour
and
she
coloured
a
little
too
from
sympathy
more
than
anything
else
for
she
felt
certain
that
all
her
young
friend
thoughts
and
feelings
were
high
and
pure
and
noble
but
yet
she
did
not
wish
that
lady
anne
would
make
other
people
think
she
was
coquetting
with
colonel
middleton
charles
marston
walked
towards
the
window
and
tumbled
over
a
footstool
and
even
winkworth
seemed
a
little
discomposed
a
few
minutes
after
the
butler
threw
open
the
doors
and
without
looking
round
pronounced
in
pompous
tones
dinner
is
on
the
table
my
lady
but
the
next
moment
he
perceived
that
lady
anne
was
not
in
the
room
and
stood
confounded
you
had
better
knock
at
the
library
door
and
tell
lady
anne
said
brice
in
her
usual
quiet
tones
knock
at
the
door
thought
lady
fleetwood
well
this
is
very
strange
still
they
were
kept
waiting
for
some
minutes
and
then
to
the
infinite
relief
of
some
of
the
party
it
must
be
confessed
the
doors
on
the
other
side
were
thrown
open
and
lady
anne
appeared
leaning
on
hargrave
arm
and
followed
by
colonel
middleton
i
am
afraid
you
have
thought
me
lost
she
said
but
i
and
my
two
counsellors
here
have
been
considering
weighty
matters
for
the
good
of
the
nation
hargrave
allow
me
to
present
you
to
lady
fleetwood
who
says
she
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
you
in
years
long
past
not
a
word
to
her
till
you
are
in
the
for
the
dinner
is
getting
cold
this
is
my
dear
friend
miss
monkton
of
whom
we
were
talking
two
nights
ago
winkworth
hargrave
charles
marston
let
me
introduce
you
to
hargrave
my
future
husband
a
promise
before
witnesses
said
hargrave
with
a
smile
but
now
my
dear
lady
let
me
lead
you
to
the
for
i
do
not
intend
to
give
you
up
to
any
one
the
procession
was
soon
formed
and
the
party
sat
down
to
dinner
lady
anne
was
peculiarly
gay
and
lively
but
every
now
and
then
a
shade
of
grave
thought
came
upon
her
for
an
instant
which
she
cast
off
again
as
soon
her
high
spirits
seeming
to
bound
up
more
lightly
than
ever
from
the
momentary
depression
she
had
contrived
to
place
colonel
middleton
next
to
maria
and
if
the
extraordinary
truth
must
be
told
to
get
charles
marston
next
to
herself
once
or
twice
too
when
the
conversation
at
the
table
was
general
and
hargrave
was
engaged
with
some
one
else
she
exchanged
a
few
words
with
charles
marston
in
a
low
tone
thus
shortly
after
the
fish
and
soup
had
been
removed
she
said
what
made
you
look
so
gloomy
when
i
came
in
before
dinner
traitor
and
rebel
your
faith
has
been
wavering
because
you
are
a
little
tyrant
replied
charles
in
the
same
tone
for
his
heart
now
beat
freely
again
and
you
sport
with
the
pain
of
your
subjects
they
inflict
the
pain
upon
themselves
said
lady
anne
and
the
next
moment
there
being
an
interval
of
silence
she
turned
to
speak
with
hargrave
some
time
afterwards
she
took
another
opportunity
to
say
i
think
charles
you
will
stand
by
a
friend
in
time
of
need
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
for
she
spoke
very
gravely
i
can
not
explain
she
said
but
you
may
be
tried
within
hours
oh
i
understand
replied
charles
and
his
eye
glanced
towards
colonel
middleton
do
not
fear
i
will
stand
by
him
to
the
last
if
i
can
be
of
any
assistance
they
were
again
interrupted
and
the
dinner
passed
over
without
anything
worth
chronicling
till
the
ladies
rose
to
retire
from
table
lady
anne
paused
for
a
moment
before
going
out
saying
to
hargrave
do
not
forget
the
two
notes
my
dear
friend
they
are
gone
already
answered
hargrave
as
i
came
out
i
gave
them
to
your
butler
bidding
him
send
them
by
one
of
my
postilions
when
the
ladies
were
gone
hargrave
naturally
resumed
the
seat
which
he
had
occupied
at
the
end
of
lady
anne
table
and
winkworth
drew
his
chair
near
him
charles
hargrave
he
said
laying
his
hand
upon
that
of
the
old
gentleman
you
have
forgotten
me
hargrave
turned
and
looked
at
him
steadfastly
i
have
indeed
he
said
though
i
thought
i
forgot
nothing
and
have
sometimes
lamented
my
dear
sir
that
my
memory
was
too
tenacious
especially
of
affections
yet
we
were
once
very
intimate
said
winkworth
though
you
are
twenty
years
my
senior
older
in
years
i
mean
though
perhaps
younger
in
body
but
it
is
not
wonderful
for
i
have
withered
away
during
nearly
thirty
years
in
india
so
that
when
i
take
up
a
little
miniature
portrait
that
was
painted
about
the
time
i
knew
you
and
then
look
in
the
glass
i
do
not
know
which
it
would
be
better
to
do
to
laugh
or
to
cry
it
is
very
strange
said
hargrave
will
you
not
recal
the
circumstances
to
my
mind
by
some
fact
your
voice
i
will
own
sounds
familiar
to
my
ears
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
just
now
replied
winkworth
when
we
can
have
a
little
chat
alone
together
i
will
bring
it
all
up
before
you
in
a
minute
like
the
landscape
on
the
rising
of
the
sun
suffice
it
for
the
present
that
you
are
sitting
beside
an
old
friend
still
hargrave
seemed
puzzled
and
returned
to
the
subject
more
than
once
but
the
other
only
laughed
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
they
rose
to
rejoin
the
ladies
then
while
colonel
middleton
and
charles
marston
walked
away
to
the
hargrave
took
the
other
old
gentleman
by
the
arm
saying
now
you
must
give
me
satisfaction
you
have
attacked
the
honour
of
my
memory
and
i
must
have
an
explanation
lest
i
should
think
my
faculties
are
failing
well
let
us
sit
down
then
said
winkworth
and
seating
themselves
at
the
table
they
remained
there
for
a
full
hour
when
they
rejoined
the
party
in
the
the
two
old
men
seemed
as
gay
as
any
of
them
and
with
music
and
a
game
of
chess
between
winkworth
and
lady
fleetwood
the
evening
passed
lightly
to
its
close
eleven
came
without
hargrave
carriage
being
announced
but
three
notes
were
brought
to
him
by
the
butler
who
informed
him
at
the
same
time
that
his
servant
had
returned
from
hargrave
only
said
very
well
but
lady
fleetwood
thought
fit
to
tease
herself
about
the
old
gentleman
going
home
so
late
in
truth
she
looked
upon
the
remote
part
of
the
country
in
which
she
was
as
little
better
than
a
barbarous
land
and
the
journey
back
to
in
as
formidable
a
light
as
a
retreat
through
a
pass
in
presence
of
an
enemy
nor
could
she
help
expressing
her
sense
of
hargrave
courage
in
undertaking
such
a
perilous
enterprise
but
the
old
gentleman
replied
i
must
decline
the
glory
my
dear
lady
i
am
going
to
sleep
here
and
perhaps
may
spend
here
likewise
this
is
the
first
time
dear
lady
anne
he
continued
turning
to
his
fair
hostess
that
i
have
slept
out
of
my
own
house
for
years
but
what
would
i
not
do
he
continued
gallantly
kissing
her
hand
for
an
approving
look
from
those
bright
eyes
when
we
are
married
you
know
you
shall
always
stay
at
home
said
lady
anne
and
now
i
have
taken
care
that
everything
should
be
made
as
comfortable
for
you
as
possible
i
wish
i
could
have
got
a
drawing
of
your
room
at
detchton
then
you
should
have
found
all
things
precisely
in
the
same
state
when
cicero
wrote
his
essay
upon
the
of
old
age
said
hargrave
smiling
he
did
not
so
far
as
i
remember
include
that
of
being
made
love
to
by
all
the
beautiful
girls
in
the
neighbourhood
but
i
am
afraid
he
thought
that
there
might
be
some
portion
of
bitter
under
the
sweet
and
that
they
only
ventured
to
do
so
from
a
knowledge
that
we
are
very
harmless
animals
and
may
be
petted
without
peril
but
now
sweet
lady
i
will
seek
my
room
for
though
i
flatter
myself
i
am
very
hale
and
healthy
under
seventy
winters
yet
i
must
not
forget
the
good
old
maxim
that
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
is
the
way
to
obtain
many
desirable
things
this
was
the
signal
for
the
general
dispersion
of
the
party
but
henry
hayley
contrived
to
obtain
an
opportunity
of
saying
in
a
whisper
to
maria
come
down
early
dear
maria
i
must
speak
with
you
for
a
few
moments
as
soon
as
possible
events
are
thickening
around
us
and
you
may
be
frightened
at
some
things
that
are
likely
to
happen
unless
i
have
an
opportunity
of
preparing
you
for
them
the
colour
mounted
a
little
into
maria
cheek
but
she
answered
frankly
i
will
come
where
shall
i
find
you
in
the
library
replied
her
lover
and
they
parted
for
the
night
but
maria
certainly
did
not
take
the
best
means
to
ensure
early
rising
for
she
lay
awake
for
more
than
an
hour
in
anxious
and
painful
thought
chapter
xxxvii
the
clock
had
not
struck
eight
when
maria
entered
the
library
at
milford
the
servants
had
just
quitted
the
room
and
through
the
open
windows
came
the
perfumed
breath
of
summer
bearing
from
wild
banks
no
one
knew
where
the
odours
of
the
honeysuckle
and
the
eglantine
the
soft
early
beams
of
unconfirmed
day
stole
in
and
streaked
the
floor
with
long
rays
of
light
and
a
merry
bird
was
singing
without
in
harmony
with
the
fragrance
and
the
sunshine
joyful
to
the
light
heart
soothing
to
the
memories
of
sorrow
the
sweet
calm
things
of
nature
are
painful
to
anxiety
and
dread
they
raise
not
they
speak
not
of
hope
the
song
of
the
bird
the
odour
of
the
flower
the
gleam
of
the
sunshine
are
then
like
the
farewell
the
parting
kiss
the
last
long
look
maria
felt
sadly
depressed
as
she
entered
the
room
at
first
she
did
not
see
her
lover
for
he
was
standing
in
one
of
the
deep
windows
but
the
opening
door
and
her
light
step
instantly
called
him
forth
to
meet
her
thanks
dear
one
and
kind
one
he
said
drawing
her
towards
him
and
kissing
her
you
are
earlier
than
i
expected
my
maria
but
not
earlier
than
i
hoped
you
are
pale
my
love
have
you
rested
well
maria
shook
her
head
with
a
sigh
how
could
i
rest
well
with
such
apprehensions
henry
she
asked
i
watched
with
thought
till
nearly
two
and
thought
again
awoke
me
but
tell
me
now
henry
what
danger
menaces
your
words
last
night
alarmed
me
sadly
no
danger
i
trust
dear
maria
he
answered
and
i
did
not
mean
to
express
any
apprehension
or
to
excite
any
in
you
but
i
thought
it
best
to
let
you
know
that
the
hour
of
struggle
is
approaching
in
order
that
you
might
be
prepared
for
it
indeed
dearest
maria
it
is
for
your
agitation
that
i
fear
and
feel
more
than
for
any
peril
to
myself
of
which
i
believe
here
is
little
or
none
but
i
can
not
help
being
grieved
that
your
love
for
me
should
bring
even
one
cloud
over
the
sunshine
of
a
life
that
i
would
fain
render
all
bright
i
saw
how
you
were
agitated
when
i
arrived
yesterday
i
saw
that
you
had
been
anxious
and
apprehensive
regarding
me
and
i
asked
myself
what
right
i
had
to
make
you
whose
fate
has
been
shaped
in
the
fairest
mould
of
fortune
take
part
in
the
darker
lot
of
one
who
has
been
too
often
the
sport
of
adversity
every
right
every
right
henry
she
answered
warmly
or
at
least
the
best
right
the
right
of
affection
but
let
me
share
all
your
thoughts
do
you
know
in
spite
of
all
you
have
said
i
am
half
jealous
of
anne
mellent
not
that
i
dream
you
love
her
for
i
have
trust
and
confidence
enough
to
know
that
you
would
never
tell
me
you
love
me
were
such
the
case
and
indeed
what
motive
could
you
have
nor
is
it
that
i
fancy
she
loves
you
for
i
have
known
her
from
infancy
and
never
saw
the
least
cloud
dim
her
pure
high
heart
but
henry
it
seems
as
if
you
had
more
confidence
in
her
than
in
me
he
had
listened
with
a
smile
till
she
uttered
the
last
words
but
then
he
eagerly
replied
no
oh
no
dear
maria
do
not
fancy
that
for
one
moment
but
perhaps
i
have
been
wrong
i
should
have
told
you
before
that
she
knows
more
than
you
do
from
other
sources
her
father
was
intimate
with
one
now
no
more
of
whom
i
will
utter
no
reproachful
word
although
to
save
and
screen
him
the
bright
early
part
of
youth
has
been
sacrificed
by
me
in
a
word
maria
she
possesses
a
power
over
my
fate
which
no
other
human
being
has
and
frankly
and
generously
she
is
disposed
to
use
it
for
my
best
happiness
making
no
condition
but
only
asking
as
a
favour
that
i
will
let
her
unravel
the
web
in
her
own
way
can
i
could
i
refuse
her
dear
maria
but
yet
it
is
needful
that
we
should
often
consult
together
for
though
she
suggests
most
of
the
steps
to
be
taken
and
has
bound
me
by
a
promise
to
be
silent
to
every
one
as
to
the
motives
on
which
she
acts
it
is
very
necessary
that
i
should
point
out
to
her
from
time
to
time
consequences
which
in
her
somewhat
wild
and
fanciful
moods
she
does
not
see
well
replied
maria
with
a
faint
smile
i
suppose
an
explanation
must
soon
come
and
i
do
believe
she
loves
me
as
a
sister
she
does
indeed
replied
henry
and
this
very
day
all
will
be
explained
i
doubt
not
but
now
dear
girl
let
me
tell
you
that
which
is
likely
immediately
to
occur
by
some
means
your
uncle
scriven
has
become
fully
convinced
of
my
identity
with
the
poor
lad
whom
he
pursued
so
eagerly
ten
years
ago
i
know
not
well
how
he
was
first
put
upon
the
track
but
i
imagine
by
some
imprudence
oh
my
aunt
fleetwood
my
aunt
fleetwood
said
maria
with
a
sigh
she
i
know
told
him
with
the
best
intentions
all
that
she
suspects
herself
but
still
she
has
nothing
but
suspicion
nor
can
he
have
more
yes
indeed
replied
henry
he
has
conviction
and
proof
whether
legal
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
at
all
events
such
is
the
case
and
of
course
my
conduct
must
soon
be
determined
indeed
scriven
himself
is
resolved
to
bring
matters
to
an
issue
and
from
the
information
i
received
yesterday
in
the
park
he
will
probably
be
here
this
very
day
to
point
me
out
as
henry
hayley
and
charge
me
openly
with
a
felony
and
what
do
you
intend
to
do
demanded
maria
with
an
expression
full
of
terror
oh
henry
would
it
not
be
better
to
go
away
no
dear
girl
no
he
answered
that
can
not
be
i
will
never
fly
again
indeed
i
have
now
no
object
i
will
meet
him
face
to
face
hear
all
he
has
to
say
let
him
make
his
charge
and
cast
it
back
upon
his
own
head
maria
gazed
at
him
in
some
surprise
for
he
spoke
very
sternly
and
she
asked
in
a
low
and
anxious
tone
but
how
will
you
meet
the
charge
henry
will
you
defy
him
to
prove
your
identity
or
will
you
acknowledge
your
own
name
and
disprove
the
charge
of
forgery
by
the
papers
of
which
you
told
me
alas
dear
maria
those
papers
are
destroyed
said
henry
and
in
a
few
words
he
told
her
the
fate
that
had
befallen
his
most
unfortunately
he
added
i
took
it
with
me
that
very
night
i
was
attacked
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
carried
it
for
some
years
but
i
was
anxious
to
trace
out
my
mother
family
and
in
that
i
had
put
down
all
the
information
i
had
ever
gleaned
upon
the
subject
but
this
is
ruin
henry
oh
this
is
ruin
exclaimed
maria
in
an
agony
of
alarm
indeed
indeed
it
will
be
better
to
fly
oh
do
henry
do
i
i
will
go
with
you
if
you
wish
he
will
never
surely
persecute
his
niece
husband
as
bitterly
as
a
stranger
answered
her
lover
gravely
but
no
maria
dear
generous
girl
no
i
will
not
take
advantage
even
of
that
kind
noble
offer
nor
do
i
think
but
how
can
you
prove
your
innocence
without
those
papers
she
asked
interrupting
him
especially
that
declaration
of
your
father
i
think
i
can
he
answered
nay
i
am
sure
i
can
thanks
to
dear
lady
anne
how
i
shall
act
must
be
regulated
by
circumstances
we
have
determined
to
let
him
evolve
his
own
plans
step
by
step
excellent
hargrave
is
fully
in
our
confidence
and
by
his
advice
i
will
in
some
degree
be
guided
what
i
wished
to
say
now
however
more
particularly
is
this
dearest
girl
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
you
not
to
be
present
at
the
scene
which
must
ensue
upon
your
arrival
no
henry
no
she
said
do
not
ask
that
of
me
i
have
promised
to
be
yours
i
am
yours
and
in
weal
or
woe
i
will
stand
by
your
side
but
it
is
not
alone
on
account
of
anything
that
may
happen
to
me
that
i
make
the
request
answered
henry
but
because
dearest
girl
there
may
be
words
spoken
regarding
your
uncle
conduct
towards
me
and
mine
which
it
may
be
painful
for
you
to
hear
he
forces
me
to
meet
him
as
an
enemy
if
he
shows
forbearance
so
will
i
but
if
he
does
not
if
his
hatred
and
his
vindictiveness
push
him
to
the
last
extreme
the
accumulated
wrongs
of
many
years
will
find
a
voice
and
a
more
powerful
one
perhaps
than
he
imagines
stay
let
me
think
a
moment
she
replied
and
then
added
after
a
very
short
pause
no
henry
i
thank
you
much
but
i
will
adhere
to
my
first
purpose
i
will
be
present
at
the
whole
it
may
be
painful
nay
it
must
be
so
in
every
way
but
still
i
say
i
will
stand
by
your
side
in
all
and
will
not
be
scared
away
by
any
fears
of
pain
to
myself
may
you
have
your
reward
dear
noble
girl
replied
henry
and
if
a
life
devoted
to
you
can
prove
my
gratitude
that
evidence
shall
not
be
wanting
my
only
anxiety
is
to
spare
you
pain
my
maria
for
i
tell
you
for
myself
i
have
no
fears
i
am
sure
i
am
confident
that
my
character
and
my
conduct
will
come
out
of
the
trial
pure
and
unstained
and
were
it
not
for
the
agitation
that
must
befal
you
in
such
a
scene
i
should
wish
you
to
hear
every
word
that
may
be
spoken
both
against
me
and
for
me
but
i
will
not
try
to
shake
your
purpose
it
is
noble
and
high
and
like
yourself
and
i
am
sure
that
a
compensation
will
follow
for
the
painful
emotions
you
must
undergo
by
joyful
and
feelings
hereafter
and
now
dear
maria
come
out
for
a
while
to
walk
on
this
sunshiny
terrace
we
need
now
have
no
concealment
from
any
one
for
the
time
is
very
near
when
all
must
be
explained
your
words
comfort
me
henry
replied
maria
and
yet
i
can
not
help
feeling
alarm
but
i
will
try
not
to
think
of
what
is
coming
and
enjoy
our
short
hour
of
happiness
without
the
alloy
of
painful
anticipations
for
twenty
minutes
they
walked
backwards
and
forwards
upon
the
terrace
in
the
bright
sunshine
the
morning
was
cool
for
the
sun
had
not
yet
heated
the
sky
the
air
was
fresh
and
clear
for
the
ground
was
high
the
clouds
as
they
floated
along
mingling
with
the
sunshine
produced
gleams
of
purple
and
gold
upon
the
slopes
of
the
park
and
the
brown
mountain
tops
rising
beyond
and
maria
now
less
anxious
felt
that
there
is
a
voice
speaking
of
hopes
and
consolations
within
the
blessed
and
beautiful
bosom
of
mature
such
as
no
mortal
tongue
can
afford
their
conversation
too
was
very
sweet
for
both
strove
to
banish
even
from
memory
that
there
were
dangers
in
the
future
and
to
fill
the
present
with
happy
dreams
while
still
through
all
came
the
mellowing
shade
of
past
emotions
gently
and
lightly
touching
the
heart
and
making
the
thrill
of
strong
affection
all
the
more
exquisite
at
the
end
of
that
time
lady
anne
joined
them
without
bonnet
or
shawl
as
gay
as
ever
as
bright
as
joyous
is
not
this
delightful
maria
she
said
as
she
felt
the
morning
air
fanning
her
cheek
who
would
lag
in
cities
with
their
dull
clouds
and
close
atmosphere
when
there
are
such
scenes
and
such
air
as
this
when
i
have
lived
in
london
for
a
fortnight
i
wonder
at
myself
i
feel
as
if
i
were
a
stuffed
chameleon
in
a
glass
case
and
have
a
great
inclination
to
tell
my
maid
to
take
me
out
and
dust
me
while
she
was
thus
speaking
she
turned
her
eyes
once
to
countenance
and
then
added
abruptly
you
been
telling
her
i
see
it
in
both
your
faces
whenever
maria
eyebrow
goes
up
in
that
way
i
am
sure
there
is
something
very
busy
in
her
mind
you
have
been
telling
her
not
more
than
you
permitted
replied
henry
i
have
only
been
preparing
her
for
what
must
come
foolish
man
cried
lady
anne
do
you
not
know
that
you
should
never
prepare
a
woman
mind
for
anything
pain
and
fear
are
not
like
butter
or
gold
that
you
can
spread
out
to
an
infinite
thinness
you
only
augment
them
by
stretching
them
out
through
time
without
diminishing
their
weight
one
grain
let
everything
take
a
woman
by
surprise
then
she
will
bear
up
much
better
under
it
for
it
is
once
for
all
but
often
replied
henry
the
surprise
greatly
increases
the
pain
and
i
did
think
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
not
only
to
tell
her
what
was
coming
but
to
assure
her
that
whatever
appearance
things
might
put
on
there
was
little
real
danger
if
you
were
driving
a
pair
of
fresh
young
horses
in
a
curricle
would
you
say
to
her
brutes
have
run
away
but
do
not
fear
i
will
get
you
safely
round
that
corner
which
looks
as
if
it
would
dash
our
brains
out
but
never
mind
i
tell
you
dear
maria
that
there
is
not
the
least
danger
such
was
lady
anne
reply
and
now
she
added
let
us
go
and
take
a
walk
farther
in
the
park
will
you
not
put
something
on
asked
maria
you
will
catch
cold
not
i
answered
lady
anne
i
am
so
full
of
warm
high
spirits
that
nothing
cold
can
get
in
i
feel
like
a
general
who
is
sure
of
winning
just
preparing
for
a
battle
so
let
us
go
they
walked
for
nearly
an
hour
and
as
they
were
returning
they
saw
a
gentleman
carriage
standing
before
the
door
of
the
house
that
either
sir
harry
henderson
or
colonel
mandrake
said
lady
anne
i
hope
hargrave
is
down
for
i
never
saw
them
or
heard
of
them
before
yet
i
have
invited
them
both
to
breakfast
but
still
we
must
get
home
and
be
civil
i
did
not
know
it
was
near
nine
the
carriage
moved
round
towards
the
stables
and
as
they
entered
the
door
of
the
house
lady
anne
asked
a
servant
who
was
standing
there
if
gunnel
had
arrived
yes
my
lady
replied
the
man
he
is
waiting
in
the
room
you
go
and
talk
to
him
henry
said
lady
anne
maria
come
with
me
and
help
me
to
entertain
these
county
magistrates
lady
anne
however
did
not
find
the
persons
she
expected
in
the
lady
fleetwood
was
there
and
winkworth
but
neither
hargrave
nor
the
two
gentlemen
just
arrived
it
would
seem
as
if
excellent
lady
fleetwood
had
a
sort
of
presentiment
of
a
coming
bustle
for
all
her
good
intentions
and
her
little
anxieties
were
in
a
flutter
she
declared
that
she
had
been
very
anxious
about
maria
when
she
heard
she
had
gone
out
so
early
and
begged
her
to
recollect
that
northumberland
was
very
different
from
the
neighbourhood
of
london
and
that
colds
were
easily
caught
but
not
easily
got
rid
of
adding
a
number
of
sage
observations
of
the
same
kind
much
to
the
amusement
of
lady
anne
then
turning
upon
her
fair
hostess
she
informed
her
that
one
of
the
servants
had
been
seeking
her
as
two
gentlemen
had
just
arrived
to
breakfast
adding
that
they
seemed
friends
of
hargrave
who
had
gone
away
with
them
to
the
library
well
answered
lady
anne
i
dare
say
he
soon
bring
them
out
again
and
so
i
shall
wait
here
till
he
does
nor
was
she
disappointed
in
her
expectation
for
in
about
five
minutes
hargrave
returned
with
one
tall
and
one
short
elderly
gentleman
who
were
introduced
to
lady
anne
in
turn
and
then
to
her
various
guests
colonel
middleton
entered
as
the
ceremony
was
going
on
and
to
him
especially
hargrave
presented
the
two
magistrates
whose
demeanour
somewhat
surprised
maria
for
while
tall
colonel
mandrake
addressed
her
lover
with
a
sort
of
dignified
deference
fat
little
sir
harry
henderson
was
all
bows
and
scrapes
henry
received
them
frankly
but
calmly
and
a
moment
or
two
after
lady
anne
led
the
way
to
the
there
the
meal
passed
pleasantly
enough
no
one
seeming
anxious
but
maria
no
one
showing
herself
fidgetty
but
lady
fleetwood
that
dear
lady
indeed
did
her
best
to
create
several
little
disorders
but
even
with
the
best
intentions
she
was
unsuccessful
a
treat
however
was
in
store
for
her
for
breakfast
was
just
over
and
the
party
had
hardly
sauntered
into
the
when
a
rushed
up
to
the
doors
and
in
a
minute
after
the
butler
appeared
announcing
scriven
chapter
xxxviii
maria
turned
very
pale
on
hearing
her
uncle
name
and
her
eyes
unconsciously
glanced
towards
her
aunt
but
poor
lady
fleetwood
had
turned
paler
still
for
she
seemed
to
divine
in
an
instant
all
the
consequences
which
acting
unadvised
in
the
affairs
of
others
with
nothing
but
the
best
intentions
to
support
her
had
produced
and
when
she
saw
that
scriven
on
entering
the
room
was
followed
by
stolterforth
the
banker
her
heart
sank
farther
still
the
movements
of
all
parties
in
the
room
were
characteristic
hargrave
sat
calmly
for
a
minute
on
his
chair
scanning
scriven
with
a
curious
and
inquiring
eye
henry
stood
firm
and
erect
with
no
other
appearance
of
that
emotion
which
the
struggle
about
to
commence
must
necessarily
have
produced
than
a
slight
contraction
of
the
brow
and
the
least
possible
curl
of
the
lip
charles
marston
who
was
talking
with
lady
anne
murmured
in
a
low
tone
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
banker
following
the
merchant
scriven
and
once
more
and
took
a
step
forward
to
henry
hayley
side
winkworth
broke
off
a
conversation
with
brice
put
on
a
large
pair
of
spectacles
and
stared
full
at
scriven
with
a
keen
searching
look
the
two
county
magistrates
conferred
together
in
a
low
tone
glancing
from
time
to
time
at
the
entering
party
and
lady
anne
with
graceful
ease
but
with
a
colour
somewhat
heightened
advanced
a
little
before
the
rest
to
receive
her
not
unexpected
visiter
scriven
himself
could
not
be
said
to
be
graceful
but
he
was
perfectly
unembarrassed
he
was
pursuing
his
system
following
his
game
acting
in
the
same
character
which
he
had
sustained
through
life
he
had
nothing
he
thought
to
be
ashamed
of
or
afraid
of
nothing
to
agitate
him
but
eagerness
and
although
it
must
be
confessed
he
was
more
eager
in
this
instance
than
on
ordinary
occasions
yet
his
eagerness
was
much
less
intense
than
that
of
most
men
when
seeking
even
less
important
objects
good
morning
scriven
said
lady
anne
in
a
calm
tone
good
morning
stolterforth
he
was
her
banker
to
what
may
i
owe
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
i
fear
funds
must
have
fallen
terribly
or
else
risen
so
high
that
you
can
not
invest
for
me
mr
stolterforth
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
our
business
at
your
ladyship
house
is
of
a
much
more
painful
nature
replied
scriven
but
it
is
not
with
you
whatever
happens
in
my
house
must
be
business
of
mine
answered
lady
anne
and
therefore
i
must
beg
to
know
it
stolterforth
who
had
an
infinite
reverence
for
lady
hundreds
of
thousands
even
more
indeed
than
for
her
beauty
though
he
admired
both
remarked
a
certain
twinkle
of
the
eye
which
was
not
satisfactory
to
him
but
scriven
pushed
his
point
coolly
and
advancing
towards
henry
hayley
he
said
my
business
is
with
this
person
sir
i
am
now
in
a
position
to
charge
you
directly
with
being
here
under
an
assumed
name
and
character
your
real
name
is
henry
hayley
is
it
so
or
is
it
not
greatly
to
the
surprise
of
maria
and
to
the
utter
astonishment
of
lady
fleetwood
colonel
middleton
answered
in
a
cool
determined
tone
it
is
not
well
then
sir
replied
scriven
i
am
in
a
condition
to
prove
the
fact
and
moreover
that
in
the
month
of
august
the
same
henry
hayley
was
charged
upon
oath
with
forgery
and
a
warrant
obtained
for
his
apprehension
you
will
prove
sir
what
you
are
able
to
prove
replied
colonel
middleton
with
the
same
degree
of
coolness
for
everything
like
agitation
had
vanished
from
the
moment
the
struggle
began
however
as
you
are
making
a
serious
charge
you
had
better
in
the
first
place
consider
it
well
and
the
grounds
upon
which
it
is
founded
and
secondly
you
had
better
make
it
in
a
more
proper
place
than
the
of
lady
anne
mellent
what
and
give
you
an
opportunity
of
running
away
again
replied
scriven
there
my
good
sir
you
are
mistaken
for
i
do
not
intend
to
lose
sight
of
you
till
i
lodge
you
in
jail
hitherto
poor
lady
fleetwood
had
been
totally
overcome
but
she
now
rose
from
her
chair
trembling
and
exclaimed
oh
my
dear
brother
for
heaven
sake
do
you
promised
me
you
know
that
you
would
hush
exclaimed
scriven
margaret
you
a
fool
you
had
better
leave
the
room
no
stay
your
evidence
may
be
wanted
i
was
told
at
the
house
of
a
gentleman
named
hargrave
a
magistrate
for
this
county
that
i
should
find
him
here
if
he
be
present
i
must
beg
his
assistance
in
this
case
my
name
sir
is
hargrave
replied
that
gentleman
rising
and
i
am
as
you
say
a
magistrate
and
the
chairman
of
the
magistrates
of
this
district
i
am
quite
ready
to
afford
any
assistance
in
my
power
in
a
legal
manner
here
are
also
two
of
my
brother
justices
present
sir
harry
henderson
and
colonel
mandrake
whose
opinion
will
be
valuable
may
i
ask
what
charge
you
have
to
make
against
this
gentleman
colonel
middleton
i
charge
him
sir
with
forgery
replied
scriven
committed
rather
more
than
ten
years
ago
by
putting
my
acceptance
to
a
bill
with
intent
to
defraud
stolterforth
and
one
of
the
partners
of
which
house
is
now
here
with
me
where
was
the
forgery
committed
demanded
hargrave
in
london
sir
replied
scriven
then
i
am
afraid
we
can
not
entertain
that
charge
said
hargrave
informations
should
have
been
sworn
sir
in
the
county
where
the
act
was
committed
but
i
am
very
willing
to
give
any
help
in
my
power
have
you
a
copy
of
the
depositions
or
a
warrant
against
this
gentleman
or
a
copy
of
the
informations
in
fact
anything
for
us
to
go
upon
i
have
not
answered
scriven
i
was
not
aware
of
such
technical
niceties
and
set
out
at
once
with
my
friend
stolterforth
as
soon
as
i
had
procured
evidence
sufficient
to
justify
his
apprehension
and
i
do
think
that
by
a
fair
construction
of
the
law
you
yourself
can
grant
a
warrant
rather
than
suffer
a
person
who
has
already
escaped
the
hands
of
justice
to
abscond
again
it
may
be
so
replied
hargrave
and
then
after
speaking
a
few
words
to
his
brother
magistrates
he
added
it
is
my
opinion
scriven
and
that
of
the
other
two
justices
here
present
that
you
should
so
frame
your
charge
as
to
bring
it
more
immediately
within
our
cognizance
you
state
that
colonel
middleton
is
here
under
an
assumed
name
and
if
you
suspect
that
name
is
assumed
for
any
illegal
purpose
an
information
upon
oath
to
that
effect
will
quite
alter
the
case
and
enable
us
more
satisfactorily
to
deal
with
the
charge
are
you
prepared
to
make
one
i
am
answered
scriven
i
charge
him
with
being
here
under
an
assumed
name
upon
fraudulent
purposes
towards
my
niece
and
also
with
the
view
of
avoiding
apprehension
upon
a
more
serious
accusation
that
will
do
answered
hargrave
but
we
must
conduct
matters
a
little
more
formally
one
word
if
you
please
my
dear
sir
said
henry
advancing
a
little
for
my
own
part
i
have
not
the
slightest
objection
to
your
dealing
with
the
whole
case
although
several
persons
whom
i
might
wish
to
call
upon
as
evidence
are
now
in
london
and
as
this
is
merely
i
take
it
a
preliminary
examination
i
promise
you
if
you
like
to
go
into
the
whole
case
i
will
myself
take
no
steps
whatsoever
hereafter
in
consequence
of
a
want
of
jurisdiction
we
shall
see
as
we
proceed
replied
hargrave
information
must
be
reduced
to
proper
form
but
it
very
luckily
happens
that
our
clerk
has
come
over
this
morning
on
some
business
and
with
lady
anne
permission
we
shall
convert
her
library
into
a
and
deal
with
the
case
at
once
i
trust
it
is
to
be
an
open
court
said
lady
anne
for
where
so
serious
a
charge
is
made
against
one
of
my
guests
i
feel
of
course
personally
interested
oh
undoubtedly
it
is
an
open
court
replied
hargrave
for
i
could
not
suffer
an
investigation
of
so
serious
a
nature
to
be
carried
on
in
secret
even
if
the
accused
were
my
most
intimate
friend
we
will
adjourn
then
to
the
library
if
you
please
which
will
be
more
convenient
and
i
will
send
for
the
magistrates
clerk
you
shall
sit
upon
the
bench
fair
lady
although
i
almost
think
the
interest
of
the
matter
may
be
too
much
for
you
oh
dear
no
replied
lady
anne
i
can
bear
up
against
harder
things
than
this
come
maria
and
she
linked
her
arm
in
that
of
her
friend
the
emotions
of
maria
monkton
during
the
whole
of
this
scene
would
be
difficult
to
describe
minutely
much
pain
much
agitation
she
certainly
had
suffered
and
the
colour
had
risen
warmly
in
her
cheek
when
her
uncle
had
coupled
her
name
with
colonel
middleton
but
upon
the
whole
her
courage
had
rather
risen
than
fallen
and
her
composure
had
in
a
great
degree
returned
henry
perfect
coolness
and
the
gentlemanly
dignity
with
which
he
treated
her
uncle
charge
had
not
been
without
their
effect
upon
her
and
she
had
remarked
with
surprise
but
with
satisfaction
also
that
the
accusation
had
not
called
forth
an
expression
of
wonder
from
the
magistrates
before
whom
it
was
made
in
short
that
they
all
seemed
in
some
measure
prepared
for
it
the
party
then
proceeded
to
the
library
lady
fleetwood
as
they
went
endeavouring
to
communicate
something
to
scriven
in
a
low
tone
and
that
worthy
gentleman
turning
rudely
away
from
her
the
magistrates
took
their
seats
on
one
side
of
the
large
library
table
the
clerk
was
sent
for
and
almost
immediately
appeared
and
after
a
good
deal
of
trouble
he
contrived
to
reduce
the
somewhat
charge
of
scriven
to
a
technical
form
when
this
was
done
the
accuser
was
sworn
to
his
information
and
hargrave
then
turning
towards
him
said
now
scriven
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
bring
forward
your
proofs
in
the
first
place
said
scriven
the
likeness
is
so
exceedingly
strong
that
there
can
hardly
be
a
doubt
from
the
likeness
alone
i
am
ready
to
swear
that
i
believe
the
person
calling
himself
colonel
middleton
to
be
no
other
than
henry
hayley
we
have
so
many
cases
of
mistaken
identity
said
hargrave
that
it
will
require
very
strong
evidence
to
establish
the
fact
by
mere
resemblance
pray
how
long
ago
is
it
since
you
saw
this
henry
hayley
somewhat
more
than
ten
years
answered
scriven
humph
said
hargrave
what
age
was
he
then
i
believe
between
sixteen
and
seventeen
answered
the
merchant
are
they
of
the
same
height
inquired
the
magistrate
oh
dear
no
was
the
reply
henry
hayley
was
decidedly
shorter
but
if
you
recollect
his
age
that
is
easily
accounted
for
humph
said
hargrave
again
have
you
any
other
persons
ready
to
swear
to
the
identity
yes
was
the
reply
stolterforth
here
must
remember
him
very
well
we
are
ready
to
take
his
deposition
said
hargrave
and
stolterforth
coming
forward
with
some
hesitation
deposed
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
and
belief
that
the
person
before
him
was
the
same
henry
hayley
who
had
absconded
ten
years
before
scriven
then
called
upon
charles
marston
who
came
forward
without
hesitation
and
was
asked
as
to
the
resemblance
they
are
very
like
certainly
he
said
with
a
smile
but
still
either
my
sight
is
not
as
good
as
my
uncle
or
else
my
spectacles
do
not
magnify
as
much
as
his
for
i
must
confess
that
though
i
was
at
school
with
henry
hayley
and
have
been
long
acquainted
with
colonel
middleton
i
did
not
perceive
the
likeness
till
scriven
pointed
it
out
i
always
thought
him
like
somebody
i
had
known
but
could
not
tell
whom
have
you
any
question
to
ask
the
witness
colonel
said
sir
harry
henderson
turning
to
the
accused
merely
this
replied
henry
you
have
said
that
you
have
known
me
long
marston
have
you
frequently
seen
me
in
society
oh
dear
yes
replied
charles
in
the
society
of
englishmen
spaniards
and
italians
then
by
what
name
did
i
usually
go
and
how
was
i
recognised
and
received
was
the
next
question
by
the
name
of
colonel
middleton
replied
charles
marston
and
under
that
name
you
were
always
recognised
and
received
as
a
very
distinguished
officer
in
the
spanish
service
and
the
nephew
of
don
balthazar
de
xamorça
a
grandee
of
spain
by
the
marriage
of
his
niece
with
an
english
gentleman
i
have
conversed
with
several
noble
spaniards
who
claim
close
kindred
with
you
by
the
mother
side
and
this
is
all
hearsay
said
scriven
and
i
object
hold
your
tongue
sir
said
colonel
mandrake
sharply
the
magistrates
will
object
when
they
think
the
evidence
inadmissible
go
on
if
you
please
mr
marston
i
was
only
going
to
say
continued
charles
that
i
can
take
upon
myself
to
swear
that
colonel
middleton
succeeded
to
a
considerable
portion
of
the
property
of
don
balthazar
on
account
of
his
relationship
for
i
heard
it
from
persons
who
shared
with
him
humph
said
hargrave
again
i
think
as
far
as
we
have
gone
yet
scriven
you
have
made
out
a
case
of
strong
resemblance
but
nothing
more
i
will
do
more
presently
replied
scriven
drily
but
i
will
first
call
my
sister
lady
fleetwood
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
and
agitation
perfectly
indescribable
lady
fleetwood
advanced
to
the
table
in
that
exact
frame
of
mind
from
which
a
skilful
advocate
can
extract
anything
upon
earth
she
would
have
sworn
under
a
little
management
that
the
sun
was
black
and
the
moon
blue
and
to
say
the
truth
if
scriven
had
been
wise
he
would
have
let
her
alone
for
at
that
moment
she
was
a
sort
of
revolving
gun
and
there
was
no
knowing
in
which
direction
she
would
fire
as
to
keeping
her
to
the
point
that
was
quite
out
of
the
question
she
said
she
thought
it
was
exceedingly
cruel
and
unpardonable
of
her
brother
to
bring
forward
that
charge
when
he
had
formally
promised
her
not
to
do
so
and
that
she
never
would
have
told
him
a
word
about
colonel
middleton
being
henry
hayley
if
he
had
not
given
his
word
that
he
would
do
everything
he
could
to
help
him
then
you
know
him
to
be
henry
hayley
said
scriven
fixing
his
cold
eyes
upon
her
i
know
you
would
do
anything
to
prevent
his
marrying
maria
said
lady
fleetwood
now
really
angry
you
would
swear
away
his
life
though
i
am
quite
sure
he
never
committed
the
forgery
at
all
and
i
believe
you
sure
of
it
too
but
you
are
sure
he
is
henry
hayley
reiterated
scriven
remember
you
are
on
your
oath
margaret
i
believe
you
must
answer
the
question
lady
fleetwood
said
hargrave
well
i
do
believe
he
is
said
lady
fleetwood
but
i
am
sure
i
never
would
have
told
my
brother
about
the
man
coming
to
my
house
and
threatening
to
inform
against
the
poor
young
gentleman
if
he
had
not
promised
to
help
him
that
will
do
said
scriven
coolly
and
one
of
the
magistrates
inquired
whether
the
accused
had
any
questions
to
put
to
the
witness
henry
however
declined
and
as
lady
fleetwood
was
retiring
he
took
her
hand
saying
in
a
kindly
tone
do
not
agitate
yourself
my
dear
lady
you
have
not
done
me
the
slightest
harm
i
am
very
glad
of
it
replied
lady
fleetwood
warmly
for
i
am
sure
i
did
it
all
with
the
best
intentions
i
suppose
you
have
other
evidence
to
produce
mr
scriven
said
hargrave
scriven
hesitated
he
felt
he
was
coming
upon
the
most
dangerous
part
of
his
case
for
though
he
had
been
bold
in
anticipation
he
was
less
so
in
act
hargrave
however
continued
i
must
look
upon
the
testimony
of
marston
that
colonel
middleton
has
long
gone
under
the
name
he
now
bears
and
is
believed
to
be
entitled
to
it
by
persons
who
have
not
only
known
him
from
youth
but
have
had
the
best
means
of
and
strongest
motives
for
ascertaining
who
he
is
and
for
resisting
his
pretensions
if
they
were
false
as
something
very
positive
against
which
we
have
a
mere
expression
of
belief
on
the
other
side
we
must
have
something
more
sir
to
satisfy
us
besides
i
want
to
hear
something
about
this
man
who
used
threats
said
colonel
mandrake
i
am
coming
to
that
this
moment
said
scriven
seeing
that
he
must
necessarily
proceed
if
he
was
determined
to
succeed
and
remembering
that
his
companion
stolterforth
was
well
aware
that
he
had
what
appeared
strong
corroborative
evidence
against
the
man
whom
he
accused
i
think
i
have
proved
sufficiently
that
the
likeness
is
so
strong
as
to
justify
reasonable
suspicion
and
i
must
observe
that
you
have
not
heard
one
witness
yet
who
having
known
the
defendant
more
than
ten
years
under
the
name
of
middleton
can
establish
that
he
is
not
the
same
man
as
henry
hayley
i
therefore
think
you
would
be
justified
in
granting
a
warrant
against
him
but
i
will
produce
further
evidence
if
it
be
needful
here
the
clerk
whispered
a
word
or
two
to
hargrave
who
inquired
apparently
in
consequence
pray
scriven
under
what
circumstances
was
the
warrant
against
this
said
henry
hayley
quashed
or
dropped
the
merchant
hesitated
for
a
moment
as
if
not
very
sure
whether
it
would
be
better
to
enter
into
the
details
or
not
and
his
first
reply
was
vague
and
unsatisfactory
but
hargrave
pressed
him
home
the
clerk
informs
me
he
said
that
he
remembers
the
case
quite
well
and
that
the
warrant
was
dropped
because
the
officer
entrusted
with
the
execution
of
it
after
having
pursued
the
fugitive
into
italy
found
him
there
in
a
dying
state
and
subsequently
saw
his
dead
body
and
witnessed
his
funeral
do
you
admit
these
facts
or
do
you
not
sir
i
admit
that
the
officer
saw
a
dead
body
which
he
was
told
was
that
of
henry
hayley
scriven
replied
and
he
might
witness
the
funeral
for
aught
i
know
but
i
maintain
that
there
was
a
juggle
in
all
this
well
sir
answered
hargrave
this
is
at
all
events
strong
presumptive
evidence
that
colonel
middleton
can
not
be
henry
hayley
of
course
said
colonel
mandrake
for
if
henry
hayley
died
in
italy
henry
hayley
can
not
be
living
here
we
have
not
yet
come
to
the
resurrection
of
the
just
mr
scriven
we
may
have
come
to
the
resurrection
of
the
unjust
however
replied
scriven
uttering
a
joke
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
that
i
think
i
can
prove
notwithstanding
all
opposition
we
must
certainly
have
more
evidence
or
dismiss
the
charge
said
hargrave
there
is
nothing
before
us
which
we
can
either
deal
with
ourselves
or
send
to
another
court
i
say
this
much
although
colonel
middleton
has
not
yet
commenced
his
defence
well
then
more
evidence
you
shall
have
answered
scriven
i
will
beg
you
to
send
for
the
man
whom
we
brought
hither
from
london
in
our
chaise
this
request
was
immediately
complied
with
and
in
a
minute
or
two
the
worthy
gentleman
who
has
been
named
sam
was
brought
into
the
room
with
scriven
servant
who
had
received
especial
directions
not
to
lose
sight
of
him
following
close
upon
his
heels
this
worthy
personage
being
brought
to
the
table
and
sworn
declared
that
his
name
was
samuel
nugent
and
that
he
was
by
trade
a
general
dealer
he
said
also
that
on
a
certain
night
which
he
named
he
was
crossing
over
frimley
common
when
he
accidentally
kicked
something
with
his
foot
which
on
examination
he
discovered
to
be
a
that
in
it
he
found
a
number
of
papers
which
he
proceeded
to
describe
and
all
of
which
as
he
stated
tended
to
show
that
henry
hayley
and
colonel
middleton
were
the
same
person
the
book
itself
said
the
man
and
a
good
many
of
the
things
in
it
i
threw
away
but
i
kept
these
because
i
thought
they
were
curious
and
then
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
i
might
turn
a
penny
by
them
we
usually
say
turn
an
honest
penny
said
hargrave
gravely
the
word
you
have
judiciously
left
out
show
me
the
papers
the
papers
were
accordingly
handed
up
to
him
and
he
and
his
brother
magistrates
examined
them
carefully
here
is
i
find
a
in
which
there
are
some
entries
which
may
very
well
bear
the
construction
attempted
to
be
put
upon
them
i
find
the
remarkable
words
assumed
name
of
colonel
middleton
and
here
are
two
letters
addressed
to
henry
hayley
at
eton
and
several
other
things
referring
to
colonel
middleton
and
to
henry
hayley
which
taken
with
other
circumstances
and
the
striking
resemblance
throw
considerable
suspicion
on
the
case
i
am
afraid
colonel
middleton
i
must
call
upon
you
for
some
clear
and
explicit
explanation
what
is
your
defence
remember
sir
said
sir
harry
henderson
that
you
are
not
obliged
to
make
any
statement
and
that
whatever
you
say
will
be
taken
down
and
may
be
used
against
you
at
an
after
period
i
have
no
objection
to
such
being
the
case
replied
henry
calmly
while
maria
terribly
agitated
at
the
serious
turn
which
affairs
seemed
to
be
taking
closed
her
eyes
and
bent
down
her
head
upon
her
hands
i
will
simply
ask
a
few
questions
and
bring
forward
a
few
facts
to
show
the
character
of
the
man
who
stands
before
you
and
the
nature
of
the
transaction
in
which
he
and
scriven
have
been
engaged
i
do
not
know
he
continued
fixing
his
eyes
sternly
on
the
merchant
sufficient
of
the
law
of
england
to
be
sure
that
it
will
justify
me
in
requiring
that
gentleman
to
be
held
to
bail
upon
a
charge
of
subornation
of
perjury
and
the
witness
before
you
to
be
committed
for
perjury
but
i
think
i
will
show
you
very
soon
that
there
is
ground
for
such
a
charge
against
each
scriven
turned
very
white
but
whether
it
was
from
fear
or
anger
it
might
be
difficult
to
say
he
certainly
affected
the
appearance
of
the
latter
passion
and
was
beginning
to
exclaim
furiously
against
the
insolent
daring
of
the
accuser
when
henry
exclaimed
cease
cease
sir
you
have
been
like
the
rattlesnake
and
have
given
warning
of
your
design
before
you
sprang
at
me
i
have
not
forgotten
the
night
at
lady
fleetwood
however
now
i
will
proceed
to
make
good
what
i
say
joshua
brown
come
forward
and
as
he
spoke
the
pedlar
advanced
to
the
table
do
you
know
the
last
witness
continued
henry
yes
sir
replied
the
man
well
then
explain
to
the
magistrates
who
and
what
he
is
was
the
rejoinder
why
gentlemen
he
a
thief
said
the
pedlar
he
and
three
others
attacked
myself
and
this
gentleman
colonel
middleton
near
a
place
called
on
the
night
of
friday
the
knocked
us
down
pillaged
us
of
almost
everything
we
had
and
were
only
prevented
from
murdering
us
i
believe
by
some
other
people
coming
up
amongst
other
things
they
took
the
colonel
and
he
employed
me
to
get
it
for
him
so
on
inquiring
at
the
house
of
alston
a
silversmith
and
jeweller
in
the
town
of
i
found
that
the
most
likely
place
to
hear
of
it
was
at
the
shop
of
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
named
mingy
bowes
he
then
went
on
to
describe
all
that
had
occurred
on
that
occasion
and
ended
with
the
fact
of
the
having
been
thrown
into
the
fire
and
consumed
scriven
was
somewhat
alarmed
but
he
was
too
shrewd
and
to
suffer
any
advantage
to
escape
your
worships
will
remark
he
said
that
it
is
here
admitted
that
my
witness
had
in
his
possession
a
actually
belonging
to
the
person
calling
himself
colonel
middleton
and
that
there
were
papers
in
that
of
such
consequence
as
to
induce
him
to
offer
a
hundred
pounds
to
regain
it
you
will
also
remark
that
i
know
nothing
of
the
witness
except
what
he
himself
has
told
me
i
can
not
know
how
he
became
possessed
of
the
or
of
these
papers
and
as
he
has
stated
that
he
threw
the
book
away
but
retained
these
without
stating
whether
it
was
into
the
fire
he
threw
it
or
not
it
seems
to
me
that
the
truth
of
his
statement
and
the
genuineness
of
these
papers
are
rather
confirmed
than
otherwise
by
the
evidence
just
given
oh
you
can
tell
very
well
how
he
became
possessed
of
the
papers
replied
the
pedlar
looking
him
full
in
the
face
because
you
know
you
told
him
what
he
was
to
say
here
why
did
you
in
lady
fleetwood
the
other
morning
put
him
up
to
saying
that
he
found
the
as
he
was
crossing
the
common
this
was
said
in
the
most
simple
and
natural
manner
in
the
world
but
its
effect
upon
scriven
was
very
terrible
his
lips
turned
livid
and
for
a
moment
he
remained
speechless
and
motionless
holding
the
edge
of
the
table
as
if
for
support
what
is
that
what
is
that
exclaimed
colonel
mandrake
he
told
him
what
he
was
to
say
here
did
he
yes
your
worship
replied
joshua
brown
he
told
him
in
lady
fleetwood
on
wednesday
morning
last
they
ca
deny
it
either
of
them
scriven
was
utterly
confounded
and
for
the
moment
had
not
a
word
to
reply
but
sam
nugent
who
was
as
bold
in
lying
as
in
other
things
answered
at
once
with
an
oath
i
do
deny
it
it
false
how
came
you
to
know
or
rather
how
can
you
know
what
took
place
in
lady
fleetwood
demanded
scriven
taking
courage
from
the
man
bold
tone
because
i
was
in
the
next
room
sir
and
heard
every
word
of
it
answered
the
pedlar
with
the
utmost
composure
pray
how
happened
you
to
be
there
my
good
sir
demanded
hargrave
i
went
on
purpose
sir
with
another
witness
replied
joshua
brown
deliberately
the
way
was
this
the
man
mingy
bowes
that
is
the
as
they
would
call
him
or
receiver
of
stolen
goods
called
twice
upon
the
colonel
there
to
try
and
frighten
him
out
of
some
money
he
did
not
see
him
either
time
but
the
last
time
he
saw
me
and
a
very
unpleasant
sight
it
was
for
him
i
was
sitting
with
the
colonel
servant
when
he
was
shown
in
and
having
got
my
hand
upon
his
neck
about
the
robbery
i
soon
brought
him
to
reason
and
made
him
tell
me
all
about
their
plans
i
found
that
he
and
this
young
gentleman
were
to
go
to
lady
fleetwood
on
wednesday
morning
last
and
that
they
hoped
to
get
a
thousand
pounds
out
of
her
on
account
of
the
papers
they
pretended
to
have
so
i
made
my
arrangements
accordingly
knowing
that
my
lady
was
to
be
out
of
town
and
that
they
were
to
see
scriven
which
i
learned
by
accident
and
so
i
told
carlini
the
colonel
servant
not
to
say
a
word
to
his
master
for
fear
he
should
not
like
it
but
just
to
ask
leave
to
stay
one
day
behind
him
in
london
it
was
granted
readily
enough
and
as
carlini
knew
her
ladyship
housekeeper
and
one
of
the
other
servants
we
got
admission
and
you
went
to
listen
to
what
i
said
you
scoundrels
exclaimed
scriven
no
sir
begging
your
pardon
replied
the
pedlar
quite
civilly
i
did
not
go
to
learn
what
you
said
for
i
had
no
thought
you
would
say
anything
like
what
you
did
say
i
went
to
hear
what
this
man
said
to
you
that
i
might
detect
his
trick
and
punish
him
as
he
deserved
however
i
heard
enough
to
surprise
me
very
much
for
i
never
fancied
a
gentleman
would
condescend
to
trade
with
a
thief
and
promise
him
five
hundred
pounds
if
he
would
swear
away
another
man
life
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
room
for
a
minute
after
these
strong
words
and
then
hargrave
looked
round
to
the
other
magistrates
saying
this
is
becoming
very
serious
gentlemen
very
serious
indeed
said
colonel
mandrake
slowly
and
sir
harry
henderson
echoed
his
words
adding
is
the
person
who
was
with
you
on
this
occasion
in
the
room
no
sir
replied
joshua
brown
but
he
is
in
the
house
and
can
be
called
in
a
minute
let
us
hear
you
out
first
said
hargrave
be
so
good
as
to
relate
the
whole
conversation
you
overheard
the
pedlar
did
so
with
wonderful
accuracy
and
carlini
having
been
called
in
gave
exactly
the
same
account
at
first
scriven
was
silent
confused
and
overpowered
but
he
soon
recovered
himself
he
was
not
a
man
either
to
believe
or
to
admit
that
he
had
done
a
wrong
thing
and
by
the
time
the
tale
was
told
he
was
prepared
to
face
it
well
gentlemen
he
said
addressing
the
magistrates
i
do
not
well
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
the
case
if
i
did
suggest
to
the
man
a
way
of
accounting
for
having
the
in
his
possession
it
does
not
at
all
prove
that
these
papers
are
not
genuine
it
is
proved
sir
that
you
suggested
to
him
to
take
a
false
oath
replied
hargrave
very
sternly
it
is
proved
that
he
did
take
a
false
oath
and
the
credibility
both
of
the
man
evidence
and
your
own
is
very
seriously
affected
by
his
character
his
conduct
and
your
dealings
with
him
call
in
a
constable
there
i
shall
give
him
into
custody
and
send
him
to
london
upon
the
charge
of
the
robbery
if
not
of
the
perjury
with
you
sir
i
really
do
not
know
how
to
deal
and
he
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
thought
gravely
it
is
not
ten
minutes
ago
sir
said
scriven
sharply
that
you
refused
to
entertain
a
charge
against
this
person
calling
himself
colonel
middleton
because
the
act
with
which
he
was
charged
had
been
committed
in
another
county
i
did
not
refuse
to
entertain
the
charge
replied
hargrave
i
informed
you
of
what
was
the
usual
course
and
i
believe
the
strictly
legal
one
magistrates
however
must
sometimes
overstep
mere
technical
difficulties
and
in
the
case
of
this
man
samuel
nugent
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
but
will
send
him
to
london
in
custody
upon
my
own
responsibility
in
the
same
way
also
i
have
now
determined
to
enter
fully
into
your
charge
of
forgery
against
colonel
middleton
if
the
prosecutor
and
he
are
both
desirous
of
our
doing
so
otherwise
i
certainly
shall
take
no
steps
whatever
i
suppose
sir
i
am
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
technically
speaking
said
stolterforth
stepping
forward
and
as
such
i
shall
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
your
decision
upon
the
whole
case
whatever
that
decision
may
be
i
was
very
unwilling
i
must
say
to
open
the
matter
again
at
all
and
would
have
let
it
rest
had
not
scriven
pressed
me
earnestly
to
proceed
it
is
so
long
ago
that
it
might
very
well
be
dropped
and
moreover
i
always
entertained
some
doubts
as
to
whether
the
party
charged
was
the
one
really
criminal
the
evidence
certainly
was
strong
but
i
had
known
the
boy
long
and
it
was
hardly
possible
to
believe
him
guilty
in
regard
to
the
question
of
identity
i
certainly
thought
the
proofs
brought
forward
by
scriven
very
convincing
but
my
view
has
been
altered
since
i
came
here
and
now
i
entertain
many
doubts
under
these
circumstances
i
am
the
more
anxious
that
the
whole
matter
should
be
investigated
at
once
and
i
pledge
myself
to
abide
by
the
decision
of
the
magistrates
present
and
whatever
their
decision
may
be
said
henry
i
shall
be
satisfied
with
it
there
was
a
momentary
pause
as
if
no
one
knew
well
how
to
commence
the
somewhat
irregular
proceeding
agreed
upon
but
at
length
henry
took
another
step
forward
to
the
table
and
taking
hand
he
said
my
dear
sir
you
have
done
me
justice
and
from
my
heart
i
thank
you
for
your
good
opinion
to
simplify
all
your
proceedings
however
i
will
at
once
admit
that
i
am
henry
hayley
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
sir
said
hargrave
laughing
but
you
are
under
a
mistake
you
are
not
henry
hayley
my
brother
magistrates
and
myself
have
just
this
moment
agreed
that
you
are
not
and
i
can
take
upon
myself
to
affirm
of
my
own
positive
knowledge
that
we
are
right
then
why
admit
it
asked
scriven
harshly
while
stolterforth
and
most
of
the
party
present
looked
perfectly
bewildered
nay
let
me
make
the
admission
my
dear
sir
said
henry
addressing
hargrave
this
painful
scene
has
already
continued
too
long
and
i
have
only
suffered
it
to
do
so
in
order
to
show
the
vehement
animosity
excited
against
me
i
will
therefore
in
order
to
curtail
every
unnecessary
detail
admit
moreover
that
i
was
charged
with
forgery
upon
a
due
and
formal
information
upon
oath
that
a
warrant
was
granted
against
me
and
that
i
fled
the
country
that
is
enough
i
think
exclaimed
scriven
the
matter
ought
now
to
be
sent
to
a
competent
court
stop
sir
said
henry
sternly
and
be
so
good
as
to
hear
me
out
i
admit
i
say
that
i
fled
the
country
but
not
to
escape
the
arm
of
the
law
for
i
had
with
me
full
proof
of
my
innocence
and
as
you
have
heard
from
the
witness
joshua
brown
the
man
who
burned
the
of
which
he
had
robbed
me
acknowledged
that
there
was
in
it
a
document
purporting
to
have
been
written
by
the
late
hayley
which
clearly
stated
that
the
forgery
was
his
that
i
knew
nothing
of
it
and
that
i
had
consented
to
abandon
my
country
and
rest
under
the
imputation
of
crime
in
order
to
save
a
father
from
death
all
very
pretty
said
scriven
but
we
have
not
the
paper
to
examine
we
can
not
ascertain
whether
it
was
genuine
i
myself
believe
it
to
have
been
a
fabrication
and
the
evidence
was
overpowering
against
you
you
fled
at
once
to
northumberland
thence
went
to
wales
thence
to
london
thence
to
the
continent
changing
everywhere
the
notes
in
which
the
forged
bill
had
been
paid
i
wish
sir
you
would
not
interrupt
me
said
henry
you
have
surely
had
sufficient
license
of
the
tongue
allow
me
at
least
to
make
my
own
statement
connectedly
hayley
one
day
gave
me
a
draft
upon
your
house
of
which
he
had
been
very
lately
a
partner
apparently
accepted
by
yourself
to
discount
at
bank
at
the
same
time
he
entered
into
an
explanation
of
some
of
his
affairs
which
i
already
knew
to
be
seriously
deranged
telling
me
that
he
must
absolutely
have
two
thousand
pounds
more
within
a
week
and
that
as
soon
as
i
had
got
the
draft
discounted
i
must
go
down
with
all
speed
to
this
very
house
and
borrow
that
sum
for
him
of
his
friend
lord
mellent
then
in
attendance
on
his
father
at
this
house
stolterforth
kindly
discounted
the
bill
at
once
i
now
believe
the
money
to
be
obtained
from
lord
mellent
was
destined
by
hayley
to
take
up
the
bill
before
the
forgery
was
discovered
but
i
knew
nothing
of
that
and
set
out
that
night
for
belford
when
i
arrived
here
i
found
that
the
earl
of
milford
was
dead
and
that
his
son
had
set
out
to
convey
the
body
to
the
family
vault
near
caermarthen
as
i
had
been
told
that
the
necessity
of
hayley
case
was
urgent
i
followed
changing
as
scriven
says
several
of
the
notes
which
hayley
had
given
me
at
different
places
to
pay
my
expenses
i
missed
lord
milford
at
caermarthen
but
passed
him
while
in
the
mail
on
my
road
to
london
as
he
was
being
carried
into
an
inn
with
concussion
of
the
brain
his
carriage
having
been
overturned
and
nearly
dashed
to
pieces
it
is
false
however
that
i
changed
any
notes
whatsoever
after
i
went
to
the
continent
for
hayley
had
himself
provided
for
me
foreign
gold
so
that
i
had
no
notes
whatever
to
change
i
recollect
i
recollect
said
stolterforth
i
have
a
memorandum
of
it
here
several
notes
were
traced
to
a
who
said
he
had
received
them
for
napoleons
from
an
elderly
man
of
whom
he
could
give
no
particular
description
and
could
not
identify
him
i
went
to
london
in
the
most
open
manner
continued
henry
in
the
public
with
my
name
at
large
on
my
portmanteau
and
proceeded
from
the
at
once
to
hayley
house
there
i
found
him
up
and
waiting
for
me
and
for
the
first
time
learned
the
crime
he
had
committed
everything
was
already
prepared
for
my
instant
departure
and
he
besought
me
in
an
agony
of
distress
and
agitation
to
save
him
from
disgrace
and
death
could
a
son
refuse
a
father
under
such
circumstances
i
could
not
and
i
fled
the
statement
seems
exceedingly
likely
said
stolterforth
the
only
improbable
part
of
the
whole
is
that
hayley
should
send
his
son
a
boy
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
to
borrow
a
sum
of
two
thousand
pounds
from
lord
mellent
when
it
would
have
been
much
more
natural
and
proper
for
him
to
go
himself
lady
anne
mellent
smiled
and
henry
replied
there
was
a
cause
but
even
without
any
peculiar
motive
being
assigned
the
fact
did
not
strike
me
at
the
time
as
the
least
extraordinary
for
i
had
been
all
my
life
a
peculiar
favourite
with
lord
mellent
he
had
been
uniformly
kind
and
generous
towards
me
and
had
more
than
once
told
me
if
ever
i
should
want
advice
or
assistance
of
any
kind
to
apply
to
him
without
scruple
hayley
told
me
to
make
it
my
own
request
to
the
young
lord
and
i
was
prepared
to
do
so
without
much
doubt
of
the
result
i
think
the
whole
story
most
improbable
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
said
scriven
and
i
must
say
it
should
be
thoroughly
sifted
in
a
court
of
justice
before
we
admit
the
truth
of
a
tale
every
word
of
which
is
wanting
in
confirmation
confirmation
it
shall
have
to
the
fullest
extent
said
lady
anne
mellent
coming
forward
to
the
table
with
a
packet
of
papers
in
her
hand
happily
for
myself
and
others
i
can
give
that
which
you
so
bitterly
demand
sir
she
was
a
good
deal
agitated
but
it
was
evident
that
anger
had
some
share
in
her
emotion
for
as
she
spoke
she
fixed
her
bright
beautiful
eyes
steadily
upon
scriven
her
nostril
expanded
and
her
lip
quivered
in
the
first
place
she
continued
it
shall
be
confirmed
that
this
gentleman
came
down
here
to
seek
lord
mellent
stand
forth
gunnel
and
tell
these
gentlemen
who
you
are
and
what
you
know
of
this
transaction
the
good
stout
person
of
gunnel
now
made
its
way
forward
to
lady
anne
side
and
he
said
my
name
is
gunnel
and
i
am
the
landlord
of
the
bell
inn
at
belford
i
remember
quite
well
a
young
gentleman
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
though
he
was
very
tall
and
manly
for
his
age
coming
down
to
my
house
by
the
mail
in
the
month
of
august
about
ten
years
ago
that
gentleman
is
very
like
him
i
should
say
certainly
is
the
same
man
grown
older
when
he
got
out
he
asked
how
far
it
was
to
milford
castle
and
said
he
must
go
on
directly
for
he
had
to
see
lord
mellent
upon
business
i
told
him
it
was
sixteen
miles
and
that
he
could
go
on
that
night
for
that
all
our
horses
were
out
he
took
dinner
and
asked
very
often
if
the
horses
had
come
in
he
seemed
very
anxious
to
see
lord
mellent
but
as
it
was
a
stiff
journey
and
there
had
been
a
run
upon
the
road
i
did
not
like
the
horses
to
go
before
they
had
had
a
night
rest
he
did
not
change
any
notes
at
my
house
but
paid
me
in
gold
and
i
never
heard
any
inquiries
made
about
it
till
lady
anne
asked
me
the
other
night
if
i
recollected
the
facts
when
he
went
from
my
house
he
came
straight
over
here
in
a
chaise
of
mine
but
i
heard
from
the
postboy
afterwards
that
finding
the
old
lord
was
dead
and
the
young
lord
gone
with
the
body
into
wales
the
gentleman
had
gone
on
in
the
chaise
to
wooler
seeming
very
anxious
to
catch
his
lordship
as
soon
as
possible
that
all
i
know
upon
the
subject
and
quite
enough
too
gunnel
said
hargrave
with
an
approving
nod
of
the
head
i
am
quite
satisfied
said
stolterforth
but
lady
anne
exclaimed
no
not
yet
there
shall
not
be
a
shade
of
suspicion
left
upon
his
name
may
i
ask
you
colonel
mandrake
to
read
that
paper
aloud
you
were
acquainted
with
my
dear
father
and
must
know
his
handwriting
at
the
bottom
the
other
signature
i
can
prove
for
the
witness
is
now
in
the
house
and
shall
describe
what
he
saw
and
heard
i
will
read
the
paper
at
once
my
lady
replied
colonel
mandrake
i
see
your
father
handwriting
and
would
swear
to
it
anywhere
from
the
peculiar
turn
of
the
confession
of
stephen
hayley
made
in
the
presence
of
charles
earl
of
milford
on
the
day
of
october
at
harley
lodge
in
the
county
of
hertford
i
stephen
hayley
upon
the
solemn
promise
of
the
earl
of
milford
never
to
divulge
what
i
am
now
about
to
write
until
after
my
death
except
in
case
a
young
gentleman
known
by
the
name
of
henry
hayley
now
supposed
to
be
dead
should
again
reappear
in
this
country
do
hereby
acknowledge
and
confess
that
i
did
forge
the
name
of
henry
scriven
with
the
word
accepted
on
a
bill
of
exchange
which
was
discounted
for
me
by
the
said
young
gentleman
at
the
house
of
stolterforth
and
bankers
and
that
he
the
said
henry
hayley
was
totally
and
entirely
ignorant
that
the
bill
was
forged
when
he
so
discounted
it
and
that
he
never
either
knew
or
to
the
best
of
my
belief
suspected
that
the
said
bill
was
forged
till
the
very
morning
on
which
he
departed
for
the
continent
moreover
i
acknowledge
and
confess
that
he
left
england
at
my
earnest
entreaty
and
solely
with
the
view
of
saving
my
life
i
having
previously
furnished
him
with
a
paper
to
the
same
effect
as
this
present
in
order
to
ensure
him
from
danger
if
he
should
be
apprehended
and
brought
back
i
solemnly
declare
every
word
herein
above
written
to
be
true
and
i
authorise
the
earl
of
milford
to
produce
this
paper
in
case
the
said
henry
hayley
should
not
be
dead
and
should
ever
return
to
england
and
to
make
whatever
use
of
it
he
may
think
fit
after
my
death
stephen
hayley
milford
thomas
alsager
my
father
signature
can
be
proved
by
alsager
said
lady
anne
let
thomas
alsager
be
called
hargrave
will
you
put
what
questions
to
him
you
think
necessary
when
the
name
of
thomas
alsager
had
been
pronounced
a
stout
portly
man
lady
anne
butler
advanced
to
the
table
bowing
to
the
magistrates
thomas
alsager
said
hargrave
did
you
ever
witness
in
the
presence
of
your
late
master
the
signature
of
a
gentleman
named
hayley
yes
your
worship
replied
the
man
i
did
is
that
your
handwriting
demanded
hargrave
it
is
answered
the
butler
describe
what
occurred
on
that
occasion
said
hargrave
why
your
worship
replied
the
man
my
lord
had
been
very
ill
from
an
accident
by
which
he
had
nearly
been
killed
but
he
had
been
recovering
rapidly
and
had
walked
out
once
or
twice
in
the
park
when
one
morning
at
breakfast
he
had
taken
up
a
newspaper
just
as
i
was
putting
some
things
on
the
table
and
all
in
a
minute
he
started
up
as
if
he
had
seen
something
frightful
threw
the
paper
down
under
his
feet
and
trampled
upon
it
i
never
saw
him
in
such
a
way
before
and
he
cried
out
a
man
on
horseback
immediately
for
that
villain
hayley
tell
him
to
come
down
to
me
directly
and
say
if
he
does
not
come
i
will
come
and
fetch
him
my
lady
was
in
the
room
and
she
tried
to
quiet
him
he
did
get
a
little
more
composed
and
he
wrote
a
note
and
sent
the
carriage
instead
of
a
man
on
horseback
hayley
came
back
in
the
carriage
and
when
he
got
out
i
saw
he
was
pale
and
trembling
i
showed
him
into
my
lord
little
room
and
there
he
remained
for
about
an
hour
and
as
i
passed
and
repassed
i
could
hear
my
lord
voice
very
high
at
times
till
at
last
he
rang
the
bell
as
if
he
would
have
shaken
it
down
i
ran
in
as
fast
as
possible
and
i
found
hayley
on
his
knees
before
him
crying
will
indeed
i
will
do
it
this
minute
then
my
lord
answered
well
sir
if
you
have
told
the
truth
you
can
have
no
objection
to
write
it
you
may
go
away
alsager
in
about
after
he
rang
again
but
much
more
quietly
and
when
i
went
in
i
found
hayley
sitting
with
that
paper
before
him
not
spread
out
but
doubled
down
so
that
i
could
only
see
the
last
words
and
my
lord
said
wish
you
to
witness
this
signature
alsager
now
mr
hayley
then
hayley
put
his
hand
upon
the
paper
and
said
i
have
written
in
this
paper
is
true
so
help
me
god
and
then
he
wrote
his
name
my
lord
wrote
his
and
i
wrote
mine
and
went
away
in
a
few
minutes
after
hayley
went
too
but
my
lord
would
never
see
him
afterwards
though
he
called
once
or
twice
no
further
questions
were
asked
of
the
butler
but
sir
harry
henderson
remarked
here
is
your
name
upon
the
back
of
the
paper
hargrave
i
see
that
was
merely
for
verification
said
hargrave
in
order
to
be
able
to
prove
how
when
and
where
this
and
other
papers
were
found
rather
singular
indeed
said
scriven
whose
bitter
spirit
was
not
yet
fully
worked
out
that
the
earl
should
leave
such
a
paper
about
when
his
old
schoolfellow
life
depended
upon
it
he
did
not
leave
it
about
sir
answered
lady
anne
he
placed
it
in
a
cabinet
here
at
milford
a
short
time
before
his
death
and
sealed
up
that
cabinet
with
a
strip
of
parchment
impressing
the
wax
at
each
end
with
his
own
the
seal
he
left
by
his
will
to
hargrave
so
that
it
has
never
been
in
my
possession
nor
have
i
ever
been
at
milford
castle
since
my
father
death
till
i
came
here
with
hargrave
the
key
of
the
cabinet
sealed
up
in
a
letter
directed
to
me
and
explaining
the
nature
of
the
papers
i
would
find
therein
when
i
came
of
age
my
father
ordered
to
be
given
to
me
after
his
death
hargrave
witnessed
my
opening
of
that
cabinet
the
parchment
being
then
uncut
and
the
seals
unbroken
and
he
wrote
his
name
upon
each
of
the
papers
found
therein
to
identify
them
in
case
of
need
i
mention
these
facts
scriven
lest
you
should
suspect
me
of
fabricating
these
papers
though
what
possible
motive
i
could
have
for
fabricating
them
it
might
be
difficult
to
discover
not
so
difficult
as
your
ladyship
supposes
replied
scriven
with
a
last
spirit
of
disappointed
spleen
love
we
know
will
make
people
do
many
strange
things
love
cried
lady
anne
with
a
gay
smile
well
so
be
it
i
do
love
him
and
she
put
her
arm
through
that
of
henry
i
do
love
him
most
dearly
most
truly
most
tenderly
then
no
wonder
madam
your
ladyship
tries
hard
to
save
a
man
you
wish
to
marry
said
scriven
marry
exclaimed
lady
anne
laughing
joyously
nay
nay
my
good
sir
not
marry
my
own
brother
scriven
looked
confounded
and
there
was
many
a
one
in
the
room
who
was
very
much
though
not
equally
surprised
after
a
silence
however
lady
anne
turned
to
henry
placing
the
rest
of
the
papers
she
had
brought
in
his
hands
and
saying
there
henry
my
dear
brother
i
put
you
in
possession
of
that
which
is
yours
i
am
no
longer
mistress
of
this
house
of
this
estate
or
of
any
of
the
property
of
the
milford
family
they
go
with
the
title
to
you
harley
lodge
and
my
mother
property
are
all
that
i
can
claim
and
i
do
not
think
you
will
make
me
pay
back
rents
for
that
which
i
have
not
kept
willingly
one
such
brother
is
to
me
worth
all
the
property
in
the
world
henry
threw
his
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
tenderly
but
bursting
away
from
him
with
her
own
wild
grace
she
cast
herself
upon
the
bosom
of
maria
monkton
and
wept
the
magistrates
rose
from
the
table
at
which
they
had
been
sitting
and
shook
hands
with
and
congratulated
him
who
had
been
the
object
of
so
much
interest
and
so
much
investigation
charles
marston
and
winkworth
were
not
behind
them
and
poor
lady
fleetwood
exclaimed
with
a
sigh
well
this
is
very
extraordinary
and
very
fortunate
very
extraordinary
indeed
said
scriven
drily
and
not
the
least
extraordinary
part
of
the
whole
is
a
body
of
magistrates
rising
to
shake
hands
with
a
person
still
under
a
charge
of
felony
i
drop
the
charge
entirely
said
stolterforth
i
am
perfectly
convinced
as
any
reasonable
man
must
be
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
foundation
for
it
whatever
nevertheless
said
hargrave
who
had
heard
observation
and
the
rejoinder
scriven
is
quite
right
this
is
an
unusual
manner
of
expressing
the
unanimous
decision
at
which
i
believe
we
have
arrived
we
must
proceed
more
orderly
sir
harry
henderson
colonel
let
me
have
your
decision
he
spoke
for
a
single
moment
apart
with
each
of
his
brother
magistrates
and
then
resuming
his
seat
with
the
rest
he
said
it
is
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
justices
present
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
ground
for
the
accusation
which
has
been
made
against
the
gentleman
known
here
by
the
name
of
colonel
middleton
charge
dismissed
clerk
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
send
all
the
papers
to
the
proper
quarter
and
in
case
of
any
question
as
to
our
having
acted
out
of
our
jurisdiction
i
take
the
responsibility
thereof
upon
myself
the
prisoner
samuel
nugent
must
be
sent
to
london
with
a
copy
of
the
depositions
by
which
he
is
affected
then
i
am
to
consider
that
the
case
against
colonel
middleton
hayley
milford
is
disposed
of
said
scriven
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
this
case
is
sir
replied
hargrave
there
is
another
case
however
affecting
subornation
of
perjury
which
not
having
any
parallel
case
in
remembrance
i
do
not
know
how
to
deal
with
i
will
however
when
i
get
home
consult
authorities
on
the
subject
and
confer
with
my
brother
magistrates
if
you
are
still
in
the
county
you
shall
hear
from
me
on
the
matter
this
delicate
hint
was
not
lost
upon
scriven
although
he
saw
that
the
game
was
against
him
indeed
he
had
a
strong
inclination
to
see
if
nothing
could
be
done
to
retrieve
it
but
he
was
a
man
of
calculation
hardy
persevering
it
is
true
in
pursuit
of
an
object
but
yet
unwilling
to
risk
much
upon
a
perilous
speculation
and
in
the
present
instance
he
was
quietly
beating
a
retreat
as
soon
as
hargrave
eye
was
off
him
he
was
interrupted
however
in
his
course
by
a
loud
clear
sharp
voice
exclaiming
hey
scriven
scriven
and
turning
round
as
almost
all
the
rest
of
the
party
did
at
this
sudden
exclamation
he
saw
the
eyes
of
winkworth
fixed
upon
him
through
a
pair
of
large
spectacles
just
let
me
remind
you
before
you
go
scriven
said
winkworth
that
you
owe
the
sum
of
thousand
two
hundred
and
pounds
eleven
shillings
and
fivepence
to
the
heirs
executors
administrators
or
assigns
of
the
late
stephen
hayley
esq
whose
sole
representative
i
take
to
be
miss
rebecca
hayley
now
in
confinement
by
your
orders
at
brooke
green
if
scriven
ever
really
felt
fury
it
was
at
that
moment
what
is
that
to
you
sir
he
demanded
fiercely
your
assertion
is
false
no
it
is
not
answered
winkworth
it
is
quite
true
and
not
only
will
i
prove
it
so
within
the
next
three
months
but
i
will
prove
that
you
have
owed
it
for
ten
years
and
denied
the
debt
because
you
had
got
possession
of
the
vouchers
scriven
had
waxed
marvellously
pale
and
he
gazed
in
winkworth
face
as
if
he
had
beheld
a
ghost
and
who
are
you
he
demanded
in
a
dull
hollow
tone
but
those
were
the
only
words
he
seemed
capable
of
uttering
i
am
one
who
have
known
you
well
replied
winkworth
for
thirty
years
and
if
your
memory
of
faces
were
as
good
as
you
pretend
methinks
you
might
have
remembered
mine
there
go
go
we
shall
meet
in
london
within
a
month
and
pray
you
see
that
my
accounts
with
your
house
are
in
somewhat
better
order
than
those
of
unhappy
stephen
hayley
scriven
was
very
near
the
door
and
a
servant
opening
it
at
that
moment
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
slipping
out
without
any
great
bustle
henry
was
at
that
moment
speaking
a
few
words
to
lady
anne
mellent
and
pale
maria
monkton
pale
i
say
for
agitation
had
blanched
her
cheek
till
it
looked
like
the
leaf
of
a
lily
shall
i
call
him
back
and
ask
him
to
stay
he
said
in
a
low
but
eager
tone
addressing
maria
no
henry
no
she
answered
laying
her
hand
upon
his
arm
it
would
only
be
a
misery
to
himself
and
a
restraint
to
us
you
can
never
be
friends
for
you
are
nature
opposites
but
you
will
endure
him
for
my
sake
and
better
at
a
distance
at
that
moment
lady
fleetwood
advanced
towards
them
her
face
beaming
with
every
kindly
purpose
my
dear
lord
she
said
while
maria
looked
up
in
his
face
with
a
gentle
smile
i
congratulate
you
most
sincerely
and
dear
maria
too
upon
the
wonderful
events
that
have
happened
i
do
understand
it
at
all
for
my
own
part
though
i
see
that
it
has
all
ended
quite
right
and
happily
you
must
indeed
forgive
my
poor
brother
scriven
for
you
know
he
is
a
dry
commonplace
man
of
business
and
i
am
sure
did
it
all
with
the
best
intentions
maria
could
hardly
refrain
from
laughing
but
sir
harry
henderson
who
was
standing
near
said
in
a
jocular
sort
of
way
indeed
lady
fleetwood
few
of
us
understand
the
matter
completely
and
should
very
much
like
to
hear
the
whole
explained
without
waiting
for
a
newspaper
account
of
it
such
explanation
my
dear
sir
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
give
you
said
henry
but
not
now
i
have
my
sister
directions
to
ask
the
whole
party
here
assembled
and
more
especially
yourself
and
colonel
mandrake
to
remain
and
dine
with
us
i
would
hold
out
the
explanation
of
all
mysteries
as
a
temptation
did
i
not
think
that
the
bare
request
of
lady
anne
would
be
quite
sufficient
for
any
gentleman
here
present
assuredly
assuredly
my
lord
replied
colonel
mandrake
who
was
a
very
gallant
old
gentleman
with
bushy
black
and
white
eyebrows
and
an
aquiline
nose
but
unfortunately
we
are
here
in
morning
costume
that
will
be
easily
amended
said
lady
anne
with
one
of
her
gay
looks
nobody
indeed
will
remark
colonel
mandrake
costume
when
he
is
himself
present
but
if
he
needs
must
attend
to
all
those
proprieties
which
so
much
distinguish
him
a
man
and
horse
will
be
at
liberty
in
a
few
minutes
to
bring
whatever
he
requires
and
now
let
us
adjourn
to
another
room
for
this
has
been
so
full
of
agitating
feelings
that
the
air
seems
loaded
with
ill
affections
mingled
with
pure
and
noble
ones
dear
anne
said
henry
laying
his
hand
upon
hers
now
kind
lady
fleetwood
let
me
give
you
my
arm
and
let
none
of
us
regret
what
has
passed
as
we
have
all
acted
with
the
best
intentions
chapter
xxxix
sir
harry
henderson
was
very
curious
and
he
longed
to
anticipate
the
explanation
which
he
had
promised
for
the
evening
but
he
was
disappointed
for
the
principal
actors
in
the
scene
which
had
just
passed
had
given
up
they
thought
enough
time
to
facts
and
were
now
disposed
to
afford
a
larger
share
to
emotions
for
the
whole
party
remained
assembled
in
the
but
then
one
began
to
drop
off
after
another
and
the
conversation
which
had
at
first
been
of
an
eager
yet
gossiping
kind
discussing
all
that
had
taken
place
and
the
demeanour
of
several
of
those
who
had
appeared
upon
the
stage
languished
for
want
of
fresh
materials
hargrave
though
the
oldest
man
of
the
party
was
the
one
for
whom
a
sensitive
heart
and
intelligent
mind
had
preserved
least
impaired
that
delicate
perception
or
rather
i
should
have
said
intuition
of
the
feelings
of
others
which
is
so
beautiful
to
see
at
a
period
of
life
when
passions
have
become
memories
and
the
emotions
of
life
are
stilled
by
the
awful
presence
of
the
yawning
grave
he
watched
the
face
of
maria
monkton
for
a
moment
as
she
sat
with
her
cheek
leaning
on
her
hand
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
and
her
mind
evidently
brooding
over
the
scenes
which
had
that
morning
taken
place
her
heart
thrilling
with
sensations
of
joy
and
thankfulness
he
saw
the
eyes
of
the
young
earl
turn
to
her
with
a
longing
glance
as
if
he
would
fain
have
cast
his
arms
round
her
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
and
the
old
man
said
to
himself
these
young
people
would
be
better
with
fewer
eyes
upon
them
come
sir
harry
he
continued
aloud
you
and
the
colonel
must
take
a
walk
through
the
park
with
me
and
see
the
improvements
i
was
proposing
to
lady
anne
the
other
day
i
do
not
know
whether
they
may
find
favour
with
her
brother
but
i
shall
plead
for
them
strongly
for
there
is
no
art
so
full
of
vanity
as
landscape
gardening
will
you
come
and
judge
of
them
my
lord
asked
colonel
mandrake
but
henry
replied
i
fear
my
dear
sir
my
thoughts
would
be
so
busy
with
other
things
that
i
should
not
do
them
justice
in
a
short
time
i
think
i
shall
beg
the
advice
of
all
three
gentlemen
upon
many
points
both
of
taste
and
business
but
i
will
not
venture
to
do
so
hargrave
then
with
his
two
companions
walked
out
into
the
park
winkworth
had
quitted
the
some
time
before
lady
anne
had
disappeared
charles
marston
was
not
to
be
seen
and
lady
fleetwood
maria
brice
and
henry
were
the
only
persons
remaining
brice
slipped
quietly
away
and
dear
aunt
fleetwood
sat
for
a
minute
or
two
debating
with
herself
what
she
should
do
she
knew
that
it
would
be
very
pleasant
for
maria
to
be
left
alone
for
a
time
with
her
lover
she
had
not
so
much
forgotten
the
lessons
of
youth
as
to
doubt
that
but
she
thought
it
would
distress
her
niece
if
she
brought
the
matter
about
too
ostentatiously
and
she
puzzled
herself
for
an
excuse
finding
none
till
at
length
henry
laid
his
hand
upon
maria
arm
saying
dear
maria
i
want
to
speak
with
you
for
a
few
moments
then
lady
fleetwood
started
up
to
go
without
any
excuse
at
all
first
dropped
her
gloves
and
then
her
handkerchief
and
then
the
everlasting
purse
henry
picked
them
up
with
a
smile
saying
dear
lady
fleetwood
what
i
said
need
not
banish
you
we
are
going
to
the
little
no
no
stay
here
said
lady
fleetwood
hurrying
away
but
there
was
a
fatality
about
her
best
intentions
and
directing
her
steps
to
the
library
she
opened
the
door
hurriedly
trying
with
one
hand
to
keep
fast
hold
of
her
gloves
and
handkerchief
and
of
the
purse
with
the
other
when
on
the
door
flying
back
farther
than
she
intended
she
saw
before
her
charles
marston
and
lady
anne
mellent
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
lady
fleetwood
would
fain
have
retreated
instantly
but
she
had
to
shut
the
door
and
in
so
doing
she
dropped
the
purse
again
and
as
she
stooped
to
pick
it
up
the
door
coming
to
vehemently
hit
her
on
the
head
and
nearly
knocked
her
down
but
while
charles
was
hurrying
to
her
assistance
and
lady
anne
stood
half
laughing
half
crying
by
the
table
she
contrived
to
pick
up
the
purse
and
beat
a
retreat
her
next
harbour
of
refuge
was
the
little
but
there
again
she
found
henry
and
maria
who
had
gone
thither
to
avoid
interruption
and
at
last
she
bethought
her
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
try
her
own
which
she
had
the
happiness
of
finding
vacant
dear
lady
fleetwood
said
anne
mellent
when
charles
returned
fate
seems
to
lay
traps
for
her
but
now
charles
remember
our
present
compact
and
keep
it
better
than
you
did
the
last
do
you
suppose
that
i
did
not
see
while
under
all
your
affectation
of
cool
confidence
and
implicit
trust
that
your
angry
spirit
was
accusing
me
of
every
kind
of
coquetry
and
grilling
itself
like
a
london
woman
head
in
a
lace
bonnet
going
out
in
august
in
an
open
carriage
to
a
picnic
at
shooter
hill
charles
marston
laughed
well
he
said
it
is
true
i
was
uneasy
dearest
anne
but
not
with
any
doubt
or
mistrust
as
you
suppose
for
of
your
love
and
truth
i
had
no
doubt
but
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
divine
such
a
cause
as
has
now
appeared
for
your
conduct
and
you
yourself
must
confess
that
nothing
else
but
such
a
cause
could
justify
it
you
might
have
been
quite
sure
replied
lady
anne
that
i
had
a
sufficient
cause
but
i
will
own
the
trial
was
hard
she
added
in
a
lighter
tone
for
her
first
words
had
been
spoken
gravely
and
therefore
i
forgive
you
i
took
a
sly
quiet
look
at
your
face
when
the
secret
came
out
and
i
must
say
i
never
saw
a
more
remarkable
look
of
foolish
astonishment
however
perhaps
i
may
surprise
you
still
more
before
i
have
done
and
then
i
suppose
it
will
be
all
over
and
i
shall
sink
down
into
a
tame
quiet
sort
of
wife
who
if
ever
she
ventures
upon
one
of
her
old
vagaries
will
be
scolded
heartily
and
will
endure
it
with
due
submission
no
no
dear
girl
he
answered
you
must
be
ever
as
far
as
possible
what
you
are
now
i
love
you
as
you
are
and
could
not
love
you
better
for
any
change
depend
upon
it
dear
anne
it
is
the
change
after
marriage
from
what
people
were
or
seemed
before
marriage
which
is
the
source
of
of
the
unhappiness
one
sometimes
hears
of
in
married
life
then
take
care
what
you
are
about
charles
said
lady
anne
with
a
look
of
surprise
for
you
are
actually
changing
already
you
are
talking
like
a
reasonable
man
now
you
know
quite
well
if
i
had
ever
thought
you
pretended
to
such
a
character
i
never
would
have
consented
to
marry
you
but
i
forgot
one
thing
you
may
very
likely
not
wish
to
marry
me
now
do
you
remember
sir
coming
to
me
one
morning
with
a
grave
and
serious
face
and
setting
me
free
from
all
promises
because
an
alteration
had
taken
place
in
your
circumstances
now
a
very
great
alteration
has
taken
place
in
mine
i
have
lost
more
than
thirty
thousand
and
therefore
i
now
set
you
free
charles
marston
laughed
i
wo
be
free
he
answered
i
refuse
emancipation
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
love
i
am
very
glad
it
is
so
the
marriage
is
not
now
so
unequal
as
it
was
the
good
world
would
only
have
said
never
mind
what
the
world
would
say
charles
answered
lady
anne
the
world
is
a
great
fool
and
says
every
day
the
most
ridiculous
things
which
nobody
should
care
about
or
think
of
and
now
to
prove
how
little
i
care
i
am
going
to
sit
with
winkworth
in
his
for
well
go
said
charles
i
do
not
wish
to
stop
you
but
come
down
again
soon
for
i
am
determined
to
have
a
long
ramble
in
the
park
with
you
all
alone
we
shall
see
answered
lady
anne
and
she
left
him
while
the
conversation
which
i
have
just
detailed
was
taking
place
in
one
part
of
the
house
one
of
a
very
different
tone
went
on
in
the
little
between
maria
and
her
lover
she
had
gone
thither
with
her
arm
through
his
but
somehow
when
seated
on
the
sofa
there
his
arm
had
fallen
round
her
and
his
hand
clasped
hers
we
have
heard
of
eloquent
silence
and
i
am
not
very
fond
of
the
expression
nor
indeed
of
any
paradoxical
figures
still
maria
and
henry
were
silent
quite
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
after
they
entered
the
room
and
their
silence
might
well
indicate
the
presence
of
many
powerful
emotions
in
their
hearts
too
large
too
powerful
for
words
the
first
which
henry
uttered
were
do
you
forgive
me
maria
forgive
you
for
what
henry
she
asked
for
keeping
you
in
suspense
he
answered
for
withholding
from
you
that
full
entire
unclouded
confidence
which
shall
never
be
withheld
again
the
only
cause
was
dear
maria
that
my
dear
kind
generous
sister
who
rejoices
as
much
to
see
herself
deprived
of
a
large
property
as
others
would
rejoice
to
receive
one
bound
me
to
silence
till
everything
was
prepared
both
to
establish
my
claims
and
to
meet
any
charges
against
me
she
was
fearful
that
the
least
hint
escaping
might
precipitate
matters
and
place
us
for
a
time
at
least
in
a
difficult
if
not
a
dangerous
situation
perhaps
indeed
there
might
be
a
little
of
the
spirit
of
adventure
and
romance
in
her
desire
for
keeping
everything
secret
to
the
last
but
still
you
will
own
she
has
managed
admirably
for
me
admirably
indeed
exclaimed
maria
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
when
at
last
she
said
marry
my
brother
i
felt
inclined
to
run
forward
and
cast
myself
at
her
feet
but
oh
henry
what
can
i
say
of
my
uncle
conduct
what
must
you
feel
towards
him
and
are
you
quite
quite
sure
that
you
will
never
let
any
of
those
feelings
fall
back
upon
me
can
you
believe
it
for
a
moment
my
beloved
he
replied
what
upon
you
the
dearest
the
best
the
earliest
friend
i
have
you
whose
noble
heart
judged
mine
rightly
from
the
beginning
you
who
never
abandoned
me
who
never
failed
me
who
received
me
on
my
return
with
the
same
affection
the
same
confidence
which
had
existed
between
us
in
childhood
you
who
upon
my
simple
assurance
unsupported
unconfirmed
believed
the
tale
i
told
and
in
the
moment
of
danger
and
difficulty
conferred
upon
me
that
blessed
hope
which
gave
me
strength
and
courage
to
encounter
every
peril
and
triumph
over
every
obstacle
oh
no
maria
no
i
shall
ever
look
upon
you
and
your
love
as
the
crowning
mercies
of
all
those
with
which
heaven
has
compensated
for
a
short
period
of
anguish
and
disgrace
so
far
from
my
feelings
towards
scriven
falling
back
upon
you
i
trust
and
indeed
am
sure
that
my
feelings
towards
you
will
sensibly
affect
my
sensations
towards
him
angry
and
indignant
i
must
feel
but
i
will
try
as
soon
as
possible
to
banish
all
such
emotions
and
will
never
forget
that
he
is
the
uncle
of
one
who
loved
and
supported
me
in
adversity
and
sorrow
another
silent
pause
succeeded
for
maria
did
not
reply
but
she
thanked
him
in
her
heart
and
then
looking
up
in
his
face
she
said
there
is
much
i
suppose
still
to
be
done
to
establish
your
rights
not
much
replied
henry
the
whole
case
i
think
is
very
clear
all
the
steps
taken
by
scriven
to
prove
that
i
am
henry
hayley
tend
to
establish
the
fact
that
i
am
the
son
of
the
late
earl
of
milford
and
my
dear
sister
anne
had
that
in
view
in
suffering
him
to
go
on
so
long
without
bringing
forward
the
proofs
of
my
innocence
which
she
possessed
indeed
she
managed
the
whole
with
a
degree
of
skill
and
judgment
quite
extraordinary
in
one
so
young
and
apparently
so
wild
the
proofs
of
my
own
legitimacy
i
have
myself
obtained
in
an
extraordinary
manner
and
two
or
three
papers
which
luckily
were
not
in
the
of
which
i
was
robbed
fill
up
every
break
in
the
chain
of
evidence
you
will
hear
the
whole
fully
detailed
and
will
see
that
though
aristocratic
by
the
father
side
i
am
plebeian
by
the
mother
but
i
do
not
think
you
will
love
or
esteem
me
the
less
for
that
nor
to
say
the
truth
do
i
myself
regret
it
for
i
believe
that
it
is
by
the
frequent
mingling
of
plebeian
with
patrician
blood
that
the
aristocracy
of
this
country
is
so
different
from
and
so
much
superior
to
that
of
any
other
my
grandfather
is
still
living
a
fine
specimen
of
the
english
yeoman
and
i
know
that
my
maria
will
join
with
me
in
making
him
forget
his
sorrows
some
prejudices
indeed
i
know
he
has
especially
against
men
of
a
higher
rank
and
station
than
his
own
but
those
i
am
sure
will
be
removed
when
he
finds
that
his
daughter
son
can
be
fully
as
proud
of
the
upright
honesty
of
one
ancestor
as
of
the
rank
and
station
of
another
but
what
will
you
do
with
regard
to
the
property
you
have
inherited
in
spain
and
the
family
there
which
claims
you
as
one
of
its
members
demanded
maria
that
will
be
easily
managed
answered
henry
though
it
certainly
is
a
curious
situation
in
which
to
be
as
malaprop
calls
it
gentlemen
in
one
henry
hayley
frank
middleton
and
lord
milford
however
henry
hayley
we
shall
soon
dispose
of
and
frank
conduct
will
be
very
clear
to
renounce
the
name
to
restore
the
whole
property
to
repay
every
dollar
he
has
received
from
it
the
family
will
be
very
well
satisfied
with
the
restitution
for
it
was
left
to
me
by
will
not
taken
as
succession
and
i
have
a
letter
from
don
balthazar
at
the
time
he
made
his
will
stating
that
he
knew
me
to
be
no
relation
and
that
he
was
acquainted
with
my
name
and
history
yet
left
me
the
property
with
that
knowledge
the
family
therefore
could
establish
no
legal
claim
to
that
which
i
intended
to
restore
the
letter
will
only
be
useful
as
justifying
me
in
all
eyes
for
having
retained
the
property
so
long
but
i
would
fain
in
this
as
in
other
things
come
out
clear
of
any
imputation
i
am
sure
you
will
replied
maria
i
always
was
sure
of
it
henry
and
i
must
do
my
aunt
fleetwood
the
justice
to
say
that
she
has
never
ceased
to
maintain
your
innocence
dear
aunt
fleetwood
said
henry
with
a
smile
i
know
maria
she
loved
me
when
a
boy
and
would
not
easily
believe
any
evil
of
me
we
must
not
forget
her
in
our
own
happiness
maria
although
ours
will
i
am
sure
greatly
contribute
to
hers
she
must
be
with
us
as
much
as
possible
and
i
trust
and
believe
that
her
will
no
longer
have
any
power
of
working
in
a
contrary
sense
the
conversation
proceeded
in
the
same
course
for
some
time
and
then
the
whole
party
reassembled
at
luncheon
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
rambles
in
the
neighbourhood
and
in
those
various
ways
of
killing
time
which
we
usually
see
practised
in
a
to
lady
fleetwood
henry
was
tender
kindness
itself
and
he
soon
taught
the
excellent
lady
to
imagine
that
her
good
intentions
though
they
had
taken
a
droll
course
had
operated
for
his
benefit
and
to
congratulate
herself
upon
the
result
joshua
brown
was
committed
to
the
care
of
carlini
and
all
the
servants
of
the
house
though
they
did
not
comprehend
the
matter
clearly
addressed
lady
acknowledged
brother
with
infinite
reverence
and
at
every
other
word
called
him
my
lord
chapter
xl
it
was
after
dinner
the
summer
light
had
faded
from
the
evening
sky
yet
there
were
roses
in
the
west
and
a
bright
star
following
like
a
fair
handmaid
upon
cynthia
footsteps
through
the
sky
the
curtains
were
not
drawn
and
the
purple
hue
of
the
past
day
spread
through
the
mingling
with
the
more
powerful
light
of
the
lamps
like
calm
sad
memories
tempering
present
joys
the
party
at
milford
castle
consisted
as
the
reader
knows
of
ten
persons
and
they
were
still
seated
round
the
table
lady
anne
was
at
one
end
her
brother
had
assumed
the
other
the
dessert
such
as
it
was
at
that
season
of
the
year
was
still
before
them
the
excellent
wine
had
once
gone
round
the
commonplace
chat
of
the
had
gradually
subsided
and
one
of
those
fits
of
silence
which
very
often
indicate
expectation
had
fallen
upon
the
whole
party
the
one
who
was
the
most
eager
for
the
promised
explanation
was
sir
harry
henderson
who
said
after
the
silence
had
continued
for
perhaps
you
promised
us
a
history
my
lord
or
perhaps
even
i
might
call
it
a
romance
for
certainly
it
savours
of
the
romantic
it
does
indeed
answered
henry
but
like
many
another
romantic
thing
it
is
very
true
i
think
however
although
with
my
dear
sister
and
myself
some
painful
memories
may
arise
and
some
gloomy
thoughts
may
be
awakened
it
will
be
better
to
read
you
the
letter
of
him
who
knew
the
whole
circumstances
from
being
the
principal
actor
in
them
rather
than
give
you
my
own
version
of
the
details
i
will
only
premise
that
from
this
letter
lady
anne
first
learned
that
she
had
ever
had
a
brother
the
demonstrable
proofs
were
found
in
the
cabinet
which
as
you
have
heard
was
opened
by
her
in
the
presence
of
mr
hargrave
thus
saying
he
rose
and
rang
the
bell
ordering
when
the
servant
appeared
that
a
green
box
of
papers
should
be
brought
him
out
of
his
room
when
it
had
been
procured
he
opened
it
and
took
out
a
letter
from
the
top
containing
several
pages
and
having
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
he
said
after
the
death
of
my
father
the
late
earl
of
milford
this
letter
was
delivered
by
his
executors
to
his
daughter
lady
anne
whom
he
then
believed
to
be
his
only
surviving
child
it
contained
the
key
of
the
cabinet
to
which
you
have
heard
allusion
made
and
it
bears
marked
upon
the
back
be
opened
by
my
daughter
lady
anne
when
she
shall
arrive
at
the
age
of
years
provided
it
should
please
heaven
that
she
should
survive
me
the
letter
then
proceeds
as
follows
dearest
child
you
must
have
remarked
that
my
health
has
been
gradually
failing
for
some
years
the
medical
men
attribute
this
decay
to
an
accident
i
met
with
which
you
well
remember
i
myself
connect
it
with
a
much
more
painful
event
of
which
they
know
nothing
they
can
not
therefore
by
any
drugs
remedy
the
disease
i
am
now
about
to
unburden
my
whole
heart
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
to
you
for
i
feel
that
i
am
soon
about
to
be
called
hence
and
though
most
improbable
events
might
occur
which
would
render
the
secret
of
my
early
life
important
both
to
yourself
and
others
i
know
you
my
dearest
child
well
thoroughly
entirely
and
i
can
trust
implicitly
both
to
your
heart
and
to
your
understanding
you
are
too
dutiful
and
affectionate
a
child
to
blame
your
father
severely
even
if
you
find
he
has
committed
some
errors
or
to
scorn
his
injunctions
even
if
you
can
not
always
approve
his
conduct
neither
will
i
blame
my
own
parent
although
we
did
not
live
on
those
terms
of
tender
confidence
in
which
you
and
i
have
always
dwelt
together
but
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
speak
of
his
character
to
account
for
if
not
to
justify
my
own
actions
me
tell
you
then
my
early
history
i
was
my
father
second
son
and
never
was
loved
as
my
elder
brother
was
that
brother
was
kind
and
good
and
worthy
of
all
affection
but
even
to
him
my
father
was
usually
stern
and
often
even
violent
to
me
my
father
demeanour
was
exceedingly
harsh
and
imperious
instant
obedience
to
his
lightest
word
was
exacted
in
all
things
as
was
perhaps
right
and
due
but
no
command
ever
came
unaccompanied
by
a
threat
and
no
threat
ever
remained
unfulfilled
if
the
command
was
even
by
mistake
disobeyed
it
seemed
as
if
he
wished
to
make
fear
supersede
both
affection
and
a
sense
of
duty
and
he
succeeded
but
too
well
i
learned
to
dread
him
and
even
after
my
poor
brother
death
that
sad
lesson
was
not
forgotten
as
his
heir
i
was
furnished
with
ample
means
and
received
a
very
good
education
but
before
my
brother
death
i
had
been
placed
at
a
somewhat
inferior
school
where
i
formed
a
very
close
intimacy
with
a
boy
of
the
name
of
hayley
you
have
often
seen
him
as
a
man
and
must
recollect
him
he
was
weak
timid
and
somewhat
cowardly
but
i
was
in
the
custom
of
defending
him
from
the
attacks
of
older
and
stronger
boys
and
we
naturally
learn
to
love
what
we
protect
when
i
afterwards
went
to
eton
stephen
hayley
followed
me
thither
and
our
friendship
continued
unabated
even
when
i
was
sent
on
a
tour
through
europe
with
a
tutor
i
regularly
corresponded
with
hayley
my
new
rank
as
lord
mellent
making
not
the
least
change
in
our
intimacy
though
he
had
now
become
a
clerk
in
a
great
merchant
house
it
was
not
long
after
my
return
and
while
i
was
still
a
student
at
oxford
that
an
event
occurred
the
consequences
of
which
have
chequered
my
golden
fate
with
shades
unalterably
dark
one
day
in
a
country
village
where
i
had
gone
to
study
more
quietly
for
my
degree
than
i
could
do
elsewhere
i
saw
a
girl
of
the
most
surpassing
beauty
that
can
be
conceived
the
first
meeting
was
merely
accidental
but
the
second
was
designed
for
i
eagerly
inquired
who
she
was
and
finding
that
her
father
was
a
wealthy
and
honest
farmer
of
the
name
of
graves
i
contrived
to
introduce
myself
to
him
as
a
person
wishing
to
purchase
a
horse
i
soon
made
myself
intimate
in
his
family
and
the
admiration
i
had
conceived
for
his
daughter
ripened
into
the
warmest
and
truest
love
she
was
as
gentle
and
kind
as
good
and
as
graceful
as
she
was
beautiful
and
even
had
such
a
thing
been
possible
my
dearest
anne
which
it
was
not
i
would
not
have
misled
her
for
the
world
but
my
position
was
very
difficult
i
knew
my
father
proud
spirit
and
highly
aristocratic
feelings
and
that
his
consent
to
my
marriage
with
a
farmer
daughter
was
quite
out
of
all
hope
but
i
loved
her
and
she
loved
me
and
i
told
her
all
my
difficulties
she
and
she
alone
knew
who
i
was
for
i
had
given
myself
out
as
a
merchant
and
the
son
of
a
merchant
to
escape
visits
and
civilities
which
might
be
burdensome
we
hesitated
we
doubted
long
but
at
length
passion
triumphed
over
prudence
and
she
was
persuaded
to
fly
with
me
and
unite
her
fate
to
mine
we
were
married
in
secret
and
passed
nearly
a
year
in
the
fondest
affection
all
that
she
exacted
was
permission
to
write
to
her
father
to
assure
him
that
she
was
a
wife
when
the
time
approached
however
at
which
she
was
to
give
birth
to
a
child
fears
assailed
her
and
remorse
for
having
left
her
parent
house
she
made
me
promise
that
if
real
danger
occurred
i
would
send
for
him
with
all
speed
that
she
might
receive
his
pardon
and
his
blessing
before
she
died
did
come
my
child
and
death
but
she
had
the
satisfaction
she
sought
her
father
and
her
husband
were
with
her
at
the
last
hour
and
she
died
forgiven
leaving
me
with
a
poor
helpless
infant
the
old
man
fled
from
the
cottage
almost
in
a
state
of
madness
and
my
own
mind
was
so
troubled
that
for
three
days
i
forgot
all
the
dangers
of
my
situation
those
dangers
were
many
as
i
will
soon
explain
to
you
and
to
avoid
them
i
was
obliged
to
leave
that
cottage
with
the
child
as
soon
as
the
funeral
was
over
to
consign
the
poor
infant
to
the
charge
of
a
nurse
and
to
appear
in
the
gay
world
of
london
with
a
calm
face
and
none
of
the
external
signs
of
that
mourning
which
was
sincerely
in
my
heart
must
now
go
back
to
tell
some
other
events
which
had
occurred
like
most
young
men
of
my
day
i
had
been
somewhat
extravagant
and
had
lived
a
good
deal
beyond
the
income
which
my
father
allowed
me
my
debts
amounted
to
between
nine
and
ten
thousand
pounds
when
i
first
met
with
poor
mary
graves
my
creditors
were
importunate
i
had
not
the
means
of
paying
them
and
about
seven
months
after
my
marriage
one
of
them
applied
to
my
father
he
sent
for
me
and
sternly
demanded
that
i
should
give
him
an
account
of
everything
i
owed
i
did
so
and
to
my
surprise
i
found
him
much
less
enraged
than
i
could
have
imagined
but
it
soon
appeared
that
he
had
a
project
in
his
head
which
would
compel
me
to
disobey
and
offend
him
he
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
seen
a
young
lady
whom
he
named
in
short
your
own
dear
mother
i
told
him
i
had
not
but
that
i
had
always
heard
her
highly
spoken
of
he
then
informed
me
that
he
was
acquainted
with
her
father
and
that
as
she
was
an
only
child
and
heiress
of
considerable
wealth
he
had
proposed
to
him
a
marriage
between
her
and
me
your
maternal
grandfather
had
consented
upon
the
condition
that
the
marriage
should
be
agreeable
to
ourselves
and
my
father
now
said
on
condition
of
your
marrying
this
young
lady
i
will
at
once
pay
your
debts
and
settle
a
larger
income
upon
you
i
can
not
minutely
describe
the
scene
that
ensued
of
course
i
was
obliged
to
refuse
and
i
did
so
decidedly
and
at
once
that
was
sufficient
to
excite
great
wrath
but
my
father
smothered
it
in
a
degree
and
requested
me
at
least
to
see
the
young
lady
before
i
decided
i
endeavoured
as
humbly
as
i
could
to
represent
to
him
that
by
pursuing
such
a
course
and
then
refusing
to
marry
her
especially
after
what
had
taken
place
between
him
and
her
father
i
should
be
grossly
wronging
and
insulting
her
but
now
the
storm
broke
forth
he
told
me
that
a
rumour
had
reached
him
that
i
was
either
keeping
or
had
married
some
low
woman
that
he
had
refused
to
believe
such
an
assertion
but
that
my
conduct
gave
such
strong
confirmation
to
the
report
that
he
would
take
means
to
ascertain
the
fact
and
if
he
found
i
had
been
guilty
of
so
base
a
dereliction
of
my
duty
to
him
and
of
my
rank
and
station
in
society
he
would
cast
me
off
for
ever
would
bequeath
every
farthing
of
the
property
which
he
could
alienate
and
that
was
nearly
the
whole
to
strangers
and
leave
me
what
he
justly
called
that
most
miserable
of
wretches
a
titled
beggar
he
would
not
hear
me
utter
a
word
but
drove
me
forth
from
his
presence
to
seek
comfort
with
my
poor
wife
from
whom
i
was
obliged
to
conceal
the
sorrows
which
my
marriage
with
her
had
brought
upon
me
matters
continued
till
her
death
knowing
that
i
was
watched
and
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
a
thousand
stratagems
to
conceal
my
movements
even
after
the
poor
girl
death
i
knew
my
father
too
well
to
doubt
that
if
he
discovered
i
had
a
son
by
such
a
marriage
he
would
carry
his
threat
into
execution
and
in
my
difficulty
and
distress
i
applied
to
my
friend
hayley
made
him
my
confidant
and
induced
him
to
promise
that
he
would
acknowledge
the
child
as
his
own
and
superintend
his
education
till
such
time
as
i
should
be
enabled
publicly
to
declare
my
marriage
months
after
i
accidentally
met
with
your
mother
in
society
found
her
beautiful
amiable
and
in
every
respect
agreeable
to
me
and
i
took
means
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
her
she
was
quite
unconscious
of
what
had
previously
taken
place
and
gave
such
encouragement
as
no
woman
would
afford
to
a
man
whom
she
would
afterwards
reject
her
father
however
who
was
well
aware
of
the
whole
at
first
treated
me
very
coldly
but
as
soon
as
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
offer
her
my
hand
i
thought
it
right
to
have
an
explanation
with
him
and
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
i
had
acted
honourably
towards
his
daughter
in
refusing
to
be
introduced
to
her
with
such
views
unless
i
were
positively
determined
to
carry
them
out
i
soon
overcame
all
his
prejudices
he
became
attached
to
me
his
daughter
accepted
my
offered
hand
and
i
wrote
to
my
father
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
some
months
hoping
that
my
obedience
tardy
as
it
was
would
be
accepted
he
was
not
fond
of
writing
and
he
sent
for
me
to
come
to
him
when
i
went
my
treatment
was
that
which
might
have
been
shown
towards
a
very
lowly
dependant
he
told
me
that
if
i
wished
to
show
myself
dutiful
my
submission
came
too
late
that
now
i
might
marry
your
mother
or
not
as
i
pleased
that
he
approved
of
the
match
but
did
not
require
it
and
that
although
he
would
allow
me
an
income
equal
to
my
station
and
expectations
he
would
settle
nothing
upon
me
he
added
in
a
low
but
very
menacing
tone
i
have
my
doubts
young
man
i
have
my
doubts
and
if
ever
i
find
that
you
have
degraded
your
name
or
rank
i
will
leave
you
without
one
penny
of
which
i
can
deprive
you
was
obliged
to
bear
these
tidings
to
my
future
but
with
a
certain
portion
of
ambition
he
was
a
and
affectionate
man
he
knew
that
his
daughter
loved
me
he
felt
confident
from
all
he
had
seen
that
i
loved
her
and
his
consent
to
our
marriage
was
given
unwillingly
indeed
for
he
was
sufficiently
wealthy
to
look
high
for
a
match
for
his
daughter
and
to
desire
a
settlement
proportionate
to
her
fortune
however
all
objections
were
waived
and
we
were
married
my
allowance
from
my
father
was
liberal
her
fortune
was
large
and
eight
months
after
it
was
trebled
by
the
death
of
her
father
all
that
i
possessed
however
and
all
that
i
should
ever
possess
except
a
very
small
portion
depended
upon
the
earl
never
discovering
that
i
had
contracted
a
previous
marriage
and
had
had
a
son
by
a
plebeian
wife
my
dear
boy
therefore
remained
under
the
care
of
hayley
was
brought
home
by
him
while
yet
almost
an
infant
acknowledged
as
his
son
educated
with
great
care
and
displayed
in
person
and
mind
in
character
and
demeanour
but
i
need
not
read
all
that
said
henry
after
a
few
commendations
on
my
boyhood
the
letter
goes
on
thus
have
seen
him
often
my
dear
anne
you
know
him
well
for
i
brought
him
up
with
you
almost
as
a
brother
intending
to
tell
you
that
he
actually
was
so
before
you
reached
the
age
of
womanhood
i
loved
him
oh
how
dearly
and
how
well
and
you
loved
him
too
i
am
sure
with
that
fraternal
love
which
was
exactly
what
i
desired
no
act
no
thought
of
his
ever
gave
me
a
moment
pain
and
without
wishing
for
my
own
father
death
i
longed
to
be
able
to
tell
you
and
your
mother
that
this
boy
was
my
son
length
i
was
suddenly
summoned
away
to
belford
to
attend
upon
my
father
who
had
been
seized
with
severe
illness
i
could
have
wished
to
remain
in
london
or
in
its
neighbourhood
for
i
knew
that
the
affairs
of
hayley
were
getting
into
sad
disorder
i
had
already
supplied
him
more
than
once
with
considerable
sums
of
money
beyond
the
expenses
of
my
dear
boy
education
and
maintenance
and
a
new
demand
had
been
made
upon
my
purse
accompanied
by
a
vague
and
timid
threat
i
was
obliged
to
set
out
my
father
died
a
week
or
two
after
and
i
proceeded
from
milford
castle
to
caermarthen
to
consign
his
remains
to
the
family
vault
on
my
way
back
my
carriage
was
overturned
at
the
bridge
at
and
i
was
taken
up
insensible
with
concussion
of
the
brain
i
remained
ill
for
several
weeks
and
my
recovery
was
slow
and
difficult
for
a
long
time
the
medical
men
would
not
suffer
me
to
read
or
write
at
all
but
at
length
one
morning
after
i
had
been
permitted
to
go
out
once
or
twice
i
took
up
the
newspaper
on
the
and
was
struck
with
horror
and
dismay
on
reading
a
paragraph
headed
the
late
forgery
i
can
not
dwell
on
the
particulars
even
now
my
dear
child
suffice
it
to
say
that
that
paragraph
showed
me
that
my
son
your
dear
brother
had
been
accused
of
forgery
to
a
large
amount
that
he
had
fled
from
the
country
after
having
been
traced
down
to
northumberland
and
thence
to
caermarthen
in
search
of
me
it
seems
and
that
the
officer
who
had
followed
him
to
ancona
had
there
by
the
monks
been
shown
a
dead
body
which
they
solemnly
declared
to
be
his
my
feelings
were
almost
those
of
a
madman
i
knew
my
boy
was
not
guilty
i
saw
it
all
in
a
moment
that
hayley
a
bankrupt
gambler
as
he
had
proved
had
committed
the
forgery
and
had
induced
the
boy
who
thought
him
his
father
to
fly
in
order
to
screen
his
supposed
parent
at
the
same
time
a
vague
wild
hope
which
haunts
me
yet
that
my
child
might
still
be
alive
that
the
officer
might
have
been
deceived
by
a
pious
fraud
of
the
monks
took
possession
of
my
mind
and
made
me
act
upon
the
moment
with
a
degree
of
fierceness
and
resolution
which
perhaps
i
might
not
have
had
the
courage
to
display
if
i
had
paused
to
deliberate
i
sent
for
the
man
hayley
with
a
threat
that
if
he
did
not
come
i
would
fetch
him
and
when
he
appeared
before
me
all
pale
and
trembling
i
accused
him
at
once
of
what
he
had
done
as
if
i
had
had
a
revelation
of
the
whole
facts
he
was
always
a
coward
and
in
his
attempts
to
deny
and
equivocate
he
betrayed
himself
but
i
wrung
the
whole
from
him
as
if
i
had
taken
his
false
heart
in
my
hand
and
crushed
out
the
only
drops
of
truth
it
contained
i
told
him
that
if
he
did
not
instantly
and
at
once
confess
the
whole
i
would
carry
him
from
my
house
to
the
office
of
the
magistrate
that
i
would
prove
from
his
own
letters
to
me
that
he
was
a
bankrupt
and
a
beggar
but
a
few
days
before
that
forgery
was
committed
that
i
would
make
him
account
for
the
possession
of
every
penny
which
he
had
expended
since
and
leave
the
keen
hounds
of
justice
to
follow
out
the
scent
he
did
at
length
confess
the
whole
and
put
it
down
in
writing
signing
it
in
my
presence
and
that
of
alsager
the
butler
upon
the
condition
that
i
would
not
reveal
the
facts
till
after
his
death
unless
my
boy
ever
appeared
in
england
again
hopes
of
such
being
the
case
have
daily
decreased
but
they
linger
still
i
have
caused
many
inquiries
to
be
made
and
secret
investigations
to
be
carried
on
but
the
only
fact
i
have
been
able
to
discover
which
keeps
expectation
alive
is
that
there
were
two
lads
nearly
of
the
same
age
in
the
convent
at
the
time
my
poor
boy
was
supposed
to
nave
died
at
ancona
in
case
he
should
appear
again
before
you
arrive
at
the
age
of
i
have
besought
my
dear
old
friend
charles
hargrave
of
near
belford
to
watch
carefully
the
events
that
take
place
in
london
and
if
henry
should
come
back
to
desire
you
to
open
this
letter
at
once
the
confession
of
hayley
with
several
other
papers
concerning
my
private
marriage
and
the
boy
birth
and
education
are
in
an
ebony
cabinet
in
my
at
milford
castle
it
is
sealed
up
with
an
order
written
upon
it
to
the
effect
that
it
is
only
to
be
opened
by
yourself
after
you
have
reached
the
age
of
now
my
dear
child
farewell
these
lines
will
not
meet
your
eyes
till
your
father
are
closed
i
know
i
have
no
need
to
exhort
you
to
do
justice
to
your
brother
if
ever
you
should
find
him
and
if
you
should
not
to
clear
his
memory
after
hayley
death
your
mother
ample
fortune
will
be
sufficient
provision
for
you
and
the
estates
of
the
family
will
descend
to
you
without
being
specially
mentioned
in
my
will
but
remember
that
you
hold
them
in
trust
for
him
if
ever
he
should
reappear
should
such
be
the
case
i
trust
that
the
affection
which
existed
between
you
and
him
as
boy
and
girl
may
be
a
blessing
to
you
both
in
more
mature
years
and
now
that
heaven
may
protect
you
and
send
you
a
happier
fate
than
mine
is
the
sincerest
prayer
of
father
henry
voice
faltered
as
he
read
the
latter
sentences
of
his
letter
to
his
sister
and
there
were
tears
in
lady
anne
bright
eyes
but
those
tears
did
not
run
over
till
old
hargrave
laid
his
hand
upon
hers
saying
well
and
nobly
my
dear
child
have
you
fulfilled
your
excellent
father
last
behest
and
justified
his
judgment
both
of
head
and
heart
and
i
am
a
proud
man
said
winkworth
looking
at
her
through
his
spectacles
which
he
had
been
wiping
more
than
once
for
some
reason
or
another
for
i
shall
one
day
call
her
child
who
has
so
brightly
performed
her
duty
to
a
dead
father
and
a
living
brother
hush
hush
hush
exclaimed
lady
anne
starting
up
you
will
drive
me
away
did
you
not
promise
most
faithless
of
indians
you
are
as
bad
as
the
man
in
the
fairy
tale
and
as
ugly
replied
winkworth
laughing
but
i
fear
dear
lady
i
shall
never
find
a
kind
girl
to
restore
me
to
my
pristine
form
again
though
if
there
be
a
sorceress
upon
earth
who
could
do
it
she
were
anne
mellent
pray
use
your
interest
with
her
for
me
my
dear
lord
for
i
would
fain
have
youth
and
beauty
back
as
they
appeared
before
they
had
been
taken
away
by
that
fell
enchanter
time
and
here
are
two
people
in
the
room
my
old
acquaintance
hargrave
and
my
dear
sister
lady
fleetwood
who
can
tell
you
that
i
was
a
very
fellow
years
ago
when
i
was
called
charles
marston
charles
marston
exclaimed
lady
fleetwood
almost
with
a
scream
you
charles
marston
yes
my
dear
meg
replied
winkworth
even
your
poor
but
dear
me
cried
lady
fleetwood
scriven
told
me
you
were
a
bankrupt
and
charles
says
you
are
very
rich
both
meg
both
replied
winkworth
there
scriven
told
truth
and
charles
too
do
you
not
know
that
i
never
did
things
like
other
men
and
when
i
was
coming
from
india
as
there
were
some
dear
friends
who
owed
me
a
couple
of
lacs
and
were
too
gentlemanly
to
pay
an
old
friend
i
made
myself
a
bankrupt
that
the
task
of
suing
them
might
fall
upon
my
assignees
i
had
the
hint
from
grange
the
who
made
himself
a
bankrupt
every
year
just
to
call
in
his
accounts
but
i
rather
think
i
am
capable
of
paying
a
hundred
shillings
in
the
pound
and
now
all
i
have
to
say
is
and
i
say
it
deliberately
before
witnesses
if
lady
anne
mellent
will
condescend
to
take
up
with
a
merchant
and
does
not
object
to
old
age
and
is
very
fond
of
a
yellowish
skin
and
a
lean
person
i
am
ready
to
marry
her
as
soon
as
this
wound
in
my
shoulder
is
quite
well
and
i
will
settle
a
quarter
of
a
million
upon
her
on
her
whether
she
marries
me
or
well
well
my
dear
i
wo
so
complete
was
the
surprise
of
all
present
except
hargrave
and
lady
anne
that
there
was
a
dead
silence
for
and
then
lady
fleetwood
whose
wit
always
fixed
upon
something
collateral
asked
aloud
what
are
lacs
a
burst
of
laughter
followed
and
perhaps
it
was
the
best
way
of
ending
the
explanation
lady
anne
made
good
her
retreat
as
fast
as
possible
and
after
the
gentlemen
were
left
together
henry
laid
before
hargrave
and
the
rest
all
the
papers
which
went
to
prove
his
title
lord
account
of
his
private
marriage
in
a
more
detailed
form
than
he
had
given
it
to
his
daughter
the
documents
with
which
he
had
been
furnished
by
the
monks
at
ancona
to
prove
that
he
was
henry
hayley
notwithstanding
his
long
assumption
of
the
name
of
middleton
some
letters
upon
the
subject
from
don
balthazar
de
xamorça
and
last
the
certificate
of
the
marriage
of
charles
mellent
and
mary
graves
and
that
of
his
own
birth
for
these
latter
papers
he
said
i
am
indebted
to
the
activity
and
intelligence
of
that
worthy
man
joshua
brown
and
by
your
permission
gentlemen
i
will
have
him
in
and
thank
him
in
your
presence
for
all
he
has
done
for
me
the
pedlar
was
soon
introduced
and
in
graceful
terms
the
young
nobleman
expressed
his
gratitude
making
him
sit
down
beside
him
there
is
a
lady
said
henry
who
longs
much
to
thank
you
brown
and
before
breakfast
you
must
let
me
introduce
you
to
her
will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
to
drink
her
health
willingly
my
lord
replied
the
pedlar
for
you
are
but
yet
i
think
you
will
find
a
little
hitch
somewhere
that
will
want
making
smooth
in
good
truth
my
dear
young
friend
he
is
right
said
hargrave
who
had
been
looking
carefully
over
the
papers
here
is
every
proof
that
you
passed
as
henry
hayley
every
proof
that
milford
was
privately
married
and
had
a
son
every
proof
that
he
believed
you
to
be
that
son
and
that
hayley
told
him
so
but
no
legal
proof
whatever
that
the
boy
who
was
given
to
the
care
of
the
nurse
by
your
poor
father
was
the
same
that
hayley
brought
home
and
acknowledged
as
his
own
i
got
it
here
sir
said
the
pedlar
producing
an
old
i
told
the
young
lord
that
he
want
more
of
my
help
so
between
the
time
when
i
last
saw
him
and
the
day
i
went
to
listen
at
lady
fleetwood
i
ran
down
to
the
part
of
the
country
where
they
were
married
for
i
recollected
quite
well
having
seen
a
pretty
babby
about
that
time
at
goldie
the
grocer
widow
with
black
ribbons
upon
its
little
white
frock
and
i
knew
it
was
a
for
she
had
none
of
her
own
never
had
she
alive
to
this
day
and
there
is
her
certificate
that
the
child
she
delivered
to
stephen
hayley
esq
was
the
child
of
charles
mellent
and
mary
graves
she
has
got
moreover
the
order
in
charles
mellent
own
hand
to
deliver
the
child
to
hayley
and
hayley
acknowledgment
that
he
had
received
it
she
says
too
that
with
the
child
she
gave
him
a
gold
box
the
top
of
which
unscrews
and
in
it
she
put
a
paper
like
a
careful
old
body
as
she
is
with
all
the
marks
the
child
had
upon
it
such
as
moles
and
spots
and
such
like
which
most
of
us
have
more
or
less
i
got
the
box
cried
winkworth
marston
who
had
broken
off
a
conversation
with
his
son
to
listen
i
owe
that
to
the
care
of
my
little
man
jim
it
was
found
in
the
goods
and
chattels
of
poor
miss
hayley
but
there
is
amongst
her
papers
a
memorandum
written
in
one
of
her
saner
moods
stating
that
the
box
was
brought
with
the
clothes
of
her
brother
son
henry
hayley
when
he
first
came
home
from
the
place
where
he
was
nursed
and
that
she
always
preserved
it
carefully
in
the
hope
that
she
might
some
time
hear
news
of
the
poor
child
mother
who
must
have
been
of
some
rank
as
there
is
a
coronet
engraved
upon
the
box
bravo
bravo
said
hargrave
the
only
link
wanting
in
the
chain
seems
to
be
supplied
and
now
i
think
we
shall
do
without
any
further
question
and
so
think
i
dear
reader
too
