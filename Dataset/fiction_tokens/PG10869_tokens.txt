katherine
hears
the
sly
step
of
death
at
the
cedars
the
night
of
his
grandfather
mysterious
death
at
the
cedars
bobby
blackburn
was
at
least
until
midnight
in
new
york
he
was
held
there
by
the
unhealthy
habits
and
companionships
which
recently
had
angered
his
grandfather
to
the
point
of
threatening
a
disciplinary
change
in
his
will
as
a
consequence
he
drifted
into
that
strange
adventure
which
later
was
to
surround
him
with
dark
shadows
and
overwhelming
doubts
before
following
bobby
through
his
black
experience
however
it
is
better
to
know
what
happened
at
the
cedars
where
his
cousin
katherine
perrine
was
except
for
the
servants
alone
with
old
silas
blackburn
who
seemed
apprehensive
of
some
sly
approach
of
disaster
at
twenty
katherine
was
too
young
too
for
this
care
of
her
uncle
in
which
she
had
persisted
as
an
antidote
for
bobby
shortcomings
she
was
never
in
harmony
with
the
mouldy
house
or
its
surroundings
bleak
deserted
unfriendly
to
content
bobby
and
she
had
frequently
urged
the
old
man
to
give
it
up
to
move
as
it
were
into
the
light
he
had
always
answered
angrily
that
his
ancestors
had
lived
there
since
before
the
revolution
and
that
what
had
been
good
enough
for
them
was
good
enough
for
him
so
that
night
katherine
had
to
hear
alone
the
sly
stalking
of
death
in
the
house
she
told
it
all
to
bobby
the
next
day
what
happened
her
emotions
the
impression
made
on
her
by
the
people
who
came
when
it
was
too
late
to
save
silas
blackburn
she
said
then
that
the
old
man
had
behaved
oddly
for
several
days
as
if
he
were
afraid
that
night
he
ate
practically
no
dinner
he
keep
still
he
wandered
from
room
to
room
his
tired
eyes
apparently
seeking
several
times
she
spoke
to
him
what
is
the
matter
uncle
what
worries
you
he
grumbled
unintelligibly
or
failed
to
answer
at
all
she
went
into
the
library
and
tried
to
read
but
the
late
fall
wind
swirled
mournfully
about
the
house
and
beat
down
the
chimney
causing
the
fire
to
cast
disturbing
shadows
across
the
walls
her
loneliness
and
her
nervousness
grew
sharper
the
restless
shuffling
footsteps
stimulated
her
imagination
perhaps
a
mental
breakdown
was
responsible
for
this
alteration
she
was
tempted
to
ring
for
jenkins
the
butler
to
share
her
vigil
or
for
one
of
the
two
women
servants
now
far
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
bobby
she
said
to
herself
or
somebody
will
have
to
come
out
here
to
help
but
silas
blackburn
shuffled
in
just
then
and
she
was
a
trifle
ashamed
as
she
studied
him
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
glaring
around
the
room
fumbling
with
hands
that
shook
in
his
pocket
for
his
pipe
and
some
loose
tobacco
it
was
unjust
to
be
afraid
of
him
there
was
no
question
the
man
himself
was
afraid
terribly
afraid
his
fingers
trembled
so
much
that
he
had
difficulty
lighting
his
pipe
his
heavy
brows
gray
like
his
beard
contracted
in
a
frown
his
voice
quavered
unexpectedly
he
spoke
of
his
grandson
bobby
damned
waster
god
knows
what
he
do
next
he
young
uncle
silas
and
too
popular
he
brushed
aside
her
customary
defence
as
he
continued
speaking
she
noticed
that
always
his
voice
shook
as
his
fingers
shook
as
his
stooped
shoulders
jerked
spasmodically
i
ordered
robert
here
not
a
word
from
him
i
made
up
my
mind
anyway
my
lawyer
coming
in
the
morning
my
money
goes
to
the
bedford
foundation
all
except
a
little
annuity
for
you
katy
it
hard
on
you
but
i
got
no
faith
left
in
my
flesh
and
blood
his
voice
choked
with
a
sentiment
a
little
repulsive
in
view
of
his
ruthless
nature
his
unbending
egotism
it
sad
katy
to
grow
old
with
nobody
caring
for
you
except
to
covet
your
money
she
arose
and
went
close
to
him
he
drew
back
startled
you
not
fair
uncle
with
an
unexpected
movement
nearly
savage
he
pushed
her
aside
and
started
for
the
door
uncle
she
cried
tell
me
you
must
tell
me
what
makes
you
afraid
he
turned
at
the
door
he
did
answer
she
laughed
feverishly
it
it
not
bobby
you
afraid
of
you
and
bobby
he
grumbled
are
thicker
than
thieves
she
shook
her
head
bobby
and
i
she
said
wistfully
are
very
good
friends
largely
because
of
this
life
he
leading
he
went
on
out
of
the
room
mumbling
again
incoherently
she
resumed
her
vigil
unable
to
read
because
of
her
misgivings
staring
at
the
fire
starting
at
a
harsher
gust
of
wind
or
any
unaccustomed
sound
and
for
a
long
time
there
beat
against
her
brain
the
shuffling
searching
tread
of
her
uncle
its
cessation
about
eleven
increased
her
uneasiness
he
had
been
so
afraid
suppose
already
the
thing
he
had
feared
had
overtaken
him
she
listened
intently
even
then
she
seemed
to
sense
the
soundless
footsteps
of
disaster
straying
in
the
decayed
house
and
searching
too
a
morbid
desire
to
satisfy
herself
that
her
uncle
silence
meant
nothing
evil
drove
her
upstairs
she
stood
in
the
square
main
hall
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
listening
her
uncle
bedroom
door
lay
straight
ahead
to
her
right
and
left
narrow
corridors
led
to
the
wings
her
room
and
bobby
and
a
spare
room
were
in
the
wing
the
opposite
corridor
was
seldom
used
for
the
wing
was
the
oldest
portion
of
the
house
and
in
the
march
of
years
too
many
legends
had
gathered
about
it
the
large
bedroom
was
there
with
its
private
hall
beyond
and
a
narrow
enclosed
staircase
descending
to
the
library
originally
it
had
been
the
custom
for
the
head
of
the
family
to
use
that
room
its
ancient
furniture
still
faded
within
stained
walls
for
many
years
no
one
had
slept
in
it
because
it
had
sheltered
too
much
suffering
because
it
had
witnessed
the
reluctant
spiritual
departure
of
too
many
blackburns
katherine
shrank
a
little
from
the
black
entrance
of
the
corridor
but
her
anxiety
centred
on
the
door
ahead
she
was
about
to
call
when
a
stirring
beyond
it
momentarily
reassured
her
the
door
opened
and
her
uncle
stepped
out
he
wore
an
untidy
his
hair
was
disordered
his
face
appeared
grayer
and
more
haggard
than
it
had
downstairs
a
lighted
candle
shook
in
his
right
hand
what
are
you
doing
up
here
katy
he
quavered
she
broke
down
before
the
picture
of
his
increased
fear
he
shuffled
closer
what
you
crying
for
katy
she
controlled
herself
she
begged
him
for
an
answer
to
her
doubts
you
make
me
afraid
he
laughed
scornfully
you
what
you
got
to
be
afraid
of
i
afraid
because
you
are
she
urged
you
got
to
tell
me
i
all
alone
i
ca
stand
it
what
are
you
afraid
of
he
did
answer
he
shuffled
on
toward
the
disused
wing
her
hand
tightened
on
the
banister
where
are
you
going
she
whispered
he
turned
at
the
entrance
to
the
corridor
i
am
going
to
the
old
bedroom
why
why
she
asked
hysterically
you
ca
sleep
there
the
bed
even
made
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
hoarse
whisper
do
you
mention
i
gone
there
if
you
want
to
know
i
am
afraid
afraid
to
sleep
in
my
own
room
any
longer
she
nodded
and
you
do
think
they
look
for
you
there
what
is
it
tell
me
what
it
is
why
do
you
send
for
some
one
a
man
leave
me
alone
he
mumbled
nothing
for
you
to
be
worried
about
except
bobby
yes
there
is
she
cried
yes
there
is
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
fright
he
entered
the
corridor
she
heard
him
shuffling
between
its
narrow
walls
she
saw
his
candle
disappear
in
its
gloomy
reaches
she
ran
to
her
own
room
and
locked
the
door
she
hurried
to
the
window
and
leaned
out
her
body
shaking
her
teeth
chattering
as
if
from
a
sudden
chill
the
quiet
assured
tread
of
disaster
came
nearer
the
two
wings
stretching
at
right
angles
from
the
main
building
formed
a
narrow
court
clouds
harrying
the
moon
failed
quite
to
destroy
its
power
so
that
she
could
see
across
the
court
the
facade
of
the
old
wing
and
the
two
windows
of
the
large
room
through
whose
curtains
a
spectral
glow
was
diffused
she
heard
one
of
the
windows
opened
with
a
grating
noise
the
court
was
a
sounding
board
it
carried
to
her
even
the
shuffling
of
the
old
man
feet
as
he
must
have
approached
the
bed
the
glow
of
his
candle
vanished
she
heard
a
rustling
as
if
he
had
stretched
himself
on
the
bed
a
sound
like
a
sigh
she
tried
to
tell
herself
there
was
no
danger
that
these
peculiar
actions
sprang
from
the
old
man
fancy
but
the
house
her
surroundings
her
loneliness
contradicted
her
to
her
senses
the
thought
of
blackburn
in
that
room
so
often
consecrated
to
the
formula
of
death
suggested
a
special
and
unaccountable
menace
under
such
a
strain
the
supernatural
assumed
vague
and
singular
shapes
she
slept
for
only
a
little
while
then
she
lay
awake
listening
with
a
growing
expectancy
for
some
message
to
slip
across
the
court
the
moon
had
ceased
struggling
the
wind
cried
the
baying
of
a
dog
echoed
mournfully
from
a
great
distance
it
was
like
a
remote
alarm
bell
which
vibrates
too
perfectly
whose
resonance
is
too
prolonged
she
sat
upright
she
sprang
from
the
bed
and
her
heart
beating
insufferably
felt
her
way
to
the
window
from
the
wing
opposite
the
message
had
come
a
soft
shrouded
sound
another
sigh
she
tried
to
call
across
the
court
at
first
no
response
came
from
her
tight
throat
when
it
did
at
last
her
voice
was
unfamiliar
in
her
own
ears
the
voice
of
one
who
has
to
know
a
thing
but
shrinks
from
asking
uncle
the
wind
mocked
her
it
is
nothing
she
told
herself
nothing
but
her
vigil
had
been
too
long
her
loneliness
too
complete
her
earlier
impression
of
the
presence
of
death
in
the
decaying
house
tightened
its
hold
she
had
to
assure
herself
that
silas
blackburn
slept
untroubled
the
thing
she
had
heard
was
peculiar
and
he
had
answered
across
the
court
the
dark
empty
corridors
at
first
were
an
impassable
barrier
but
while
she
put
on
her
slippers
and
her
she
strengthened
her
courage
there
was
a
bell
rope
in
the
upper
hall
she
might
get
jenkins
when
she
stood
in
the
main
hall
she
hesitated
it
would
probably
be
a
long
time
provided
he
heard
at
all
before
jenkins
could
answer
her
her
candle
outlined
the
entrance
to
the
musty
corridor
just
a
few
running
steps
down
there
a
quick
rap
at
the
door
and
perhaps
in
an
instant
her
uncle
voice
and
the
blessed
power
to
return
to
her
room
and
sleep
while
her
fear
grew
she
called
on
her
pride
to
let
her
accomplish
that
brief
abhorrent
journey
then
for
the
first
time
a
different
doubt
came
to
her
as
she
waited
alone
in
this
disturbing
nocturnal
intimacy
of
an
old
house
she
shrank
from
no
thought
of
human
intrusion
and
she
wondered
if
her
uncle
had
been
afraid
of
that
too
of
the
sort
of
thing
that
might
lurk
in
the
ancient
wing
with
its
recollections
of
birth
and
suffering
and
death
but
he
had
gone
there
as
an
escape
surely
he
had
been
afraid
of
men
it
shamed
her
that
in
spite
of
that
her
fear
defined
itself
ever
more
clearly
as
something
indefinable
with
a
passionate
determination
to
strangle
such
thoughts
she
held
her
breath
she
tried
to
close
her
mind
she
entered
the
corridor
she
ran
its
length
she
knocked
at
the
locked
door
of
the
old
bedroom
she
shrank
as
the
echoes
rattled
from
the
dingy
walls
where
her
candle
cast
strange
reflections
there
was
no
other
answer
a
sense
of
an
intolerable
companionship
made
her
want
to
cry
out
for
brilliant
light
for
help
she
screamed
uncle
silas
uncle
silas
through
the
silence
that
crushed
her
voice
she
became
aware
finally
of
the
accomplishment
of
its
mission
by
death
in
this
house
and
she
fled
into
the
main
hall
she
jerked
at
the
bell
rope
the
contact
steadied
her
stimulated
her
to
reason
one
slender
hope
remained
the
oppressive
bedroom
might
have
driven
silas
blackburn
through
the
private
hall
and
down
the
enclosed
staircase
perhaps
he
slept
on
the
lounge
in
the
library
she
stumbled
down
hoping
to
meet
jenkins
she
crossed
the
hall
and
the
dining
room
and
entered
the
library
she
bent
over
the
lounge
it
was
empty
her
candle
was
reflected
in
the
face
of
the
clock
on
the
mantel
its
hands
pointed
to
two
she
pulled
at
the
bell
cord
by
the
fireplace
why
did
the
butler
come
alone
she
could
climb
the
enclosed
staircase
to
try
the
other
door
it
seemed
impossible
to
her
that
she
should
wait
another
instant
alone
the
butler
as
old
and
as
gray
as
silas
blackburn
faltered
in
he
started
back
when
he
saw
her
my
god
miss
katherine
what
the
matter
you
look
like
death
there
death
she
said
she
indicated
the
door
of
the
enclosed
staircase
she
led
the
way
with
the
candle
the
panelled
narrow
hall
was
empty
that
door
too
was
locked
and
the
key
she
knew
must
be
on
the
inside
who
who
is
it
jenkins
asked
who
would
be
in
that
room
has
bobby
come
back
she
descended
to
the
library
before
answering
she
put
the
candle
down
and
spread
her
hands
it
happened
jenkins
whatever
he
feared
not
mr
silas
we
have
to
break
in
she
said
with
a
shiver
get
a
hammer
a
chisel
whatever
is
necessary
but
if
there
anything
wrong
the
butler
objected
if
anybody
been
there
the
other
door
must
be
open
she
shook
her
head
those
two
first
of
all
faced
that
extraordinary
puzzle
how
had
the
murderer
entered
and
left
the
room
with
both
doors
locked
on
the
inside
with
the
windows
too
high
for
use
they
went
to
the
upper
story
she
urged
the
butler
into
the
sombre
corridor
we
have
to
know
she
whispered
what
happened
beyond
those
locked
doors
she
still
vibrated
to
the
feeling
of
unconformable
forces
in
the
old
house
jenkins
she
saw
responded
to
the
same
superstitious
misgivings
he
inserted
the
chisel
with
maladroit
hands
he
forced
the
lock
back
and
opened
the
door
dust
arose
from
the
room
flecking
the
yellow
candle
flame
they
hesitated
on
the
threshold
they
forced
themselves
to
enter
then
they
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
with
relief
for
silas
blackburn
in
his
lay
on
the
bed
his
placid
unmarked
face
upturned
as
if
sleeping
why
miss
jenkins
gasped
he
all
right
almost
with
confidence
katherine
walked
to
the
bed
uncle
silas
she
began
and
touched
his
hand
she
drew
back
until
the
wall
supported
her
jenkins
must
have
read
everything
in
her
face
for
he
whimpered
but
he
looks
all
right
he
ca
be
cold
already
if
i
had
touched
the
horror
of
the
thing
descended
upon
her
stifling
thought
automatically
she
left
the
room
and
told
jenkins
what
to
do
after
he
had
telephoned
police
headquarters
in
the
county
seat
and
had
summoned
doctor
groom
a
country
physician
she
sat
without
words
huddled
over
the
library
fire
the
detective
a
competent
man
named
howells
and
doctor
groom
arrived
at
about
the
same
time
the
detective
made
katherine
accompany
them
upstairs
while
he
questioned
her
in
the
absence
of
the
coroner
he
would
let
the
doctor
touch
the
body
i
must
repair
this
lock
he
said
the
first
thing
so
nothing
can
be
disturbed
doctor
groom
a
grim
and
dark
man
had
grown
silent
on
entering
the
room
for
a
long
time
he
stared
at
the
body
in
the
candle
light
making
as
much
of
an
examination
as
he
could
evidently
without
physical
contact
why
did
he
ever
come
here
to
sleep
he
asked
in
his
rumbling
bass
voice
nasty
room
unhealthy
room
ten
to
one
you
a
formality
policeman
coroner
a
formality
he
sneered
a
little
i
daresay
he
died
what
the
world
will
call
a
natural
death
wonder
what
the
coroner
say
the
detective
did
answer
he
shot
rapid
uneasy
glances
about
the
room
in
which
a
single
candle
burned
after
a
time
he
said
with
an
accent
of
complete
conviction
that
man
was
murdered
perhaps
the
doctor
significant
words
added
to
her
earlier
dread
of
the
abnormal
made
katherine
read
in
the
detective
manner
an
apprehension
of
conditions
unfamiliar
to
the
brutal
routine
of
his
profession
her
glances
were
restless
too
she
had
a
feeling
that
from
the
shadowed
corners
of
the
faded
musty
room
invisible
faces
mocked
the
stubbornness
all
this
she
recited
to
bobby
when
under
extraordinary
circumstances
neither
of
them
could
have
foreseen
he
arrived
at
the
cedars
many
hours
later
of
the
earlier
portion
of
the
night
of
his
grandfather
death
bobby
retained
a
minute
recollection
the
remainder
was
like
a
dim
appalling
nightmare
whose
impulse
remains
hidden
when
he
went
to
his
apartment
to
dress
for
dinner
he
found
the
letter
of
which
silas
blackburn
had
spoken
to
katherine
it
mentioned
the
change
in
the
will
as
an
approaching
fact
nothing
could
alter
bobby
fancied
that
the
old
man
merely
craved
the
satisfaction
of
terrorizing
him
of
casting
him
out
with
all
the
ugly
words
at
his
command
still
a
good
deal
more
than
a
million
is
to
be
relinquished
lightly
as
long
as
a
chance
remains
bobby
had
an
engagement
for
dinner
he
would
think
the
situation
over
until
after
dinner
then
he
might
go
it
was
perhaps
unfortunate
that
at
his
club
he
met
friends
who
drew
him
in
a
corner
and
offered
him
too
many
cocktails
as
he
drank
his
anger
grew
and
it
was
all
against
his
grandfather
he
asked
himself
why
during
the
last
few
months
he
had
avoided
the
cedars
why
he
had
drifted
into
too
vivid
a
life
in
new
york
it
increased
his
anger
that
he
hesitated
to
give
himself
a
frank
answer
but
always
at
such
moments
it
was
katherine
rather
than
his
grandfather
who
entered
his
mind
he
had
cared
too
much
for
her
and
lately
beyond
question
the
bond
of
their
affection
had
weakened
he
raised
his
glass
and
drank
he
set
the
glass
down
quickly
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
hide
it
a
big
man
and
handsome
walked
into
the
room
and
came
straight
to
the
little
group
in
the
corner
bobby
tried
to
carry
it
off
hartley
old
preacher
you
fellows
all
know
hartley
graham
sit
down
we
going
to
have
a
little
cocktail
graham
looked
at
the
glasses
shaking
his
head
if
you
time
bobby
i
like
a
word
with
you
no
preaching
bobby
bargained
it
is
sunday
graham
laughed
pleasantly
it
about
money
that
talks
any
day
bobby
edged
a
way
out
and
followed
graham
to
an
unoccupied
room
there
the
big
man
turned
on
him
see
here
bobby
when
are
you
going
out
to
the
cedars
bobby
flushed
you
a
dear
friend
hartley
and
i
always
loved
you
but
i
in
no
mood
for
preaching
tonight
besides
i
got
my
own
life
to
lead
he
glanced
away
my
own
reasons
for
leading
it
i
not
going
to
preach
graham
answered
seriously
although
obvious
you
raising
the
devil
with
your
life
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
had
a
note
from
katherine
she
says
your
threats
are
taking
too
much
form
that
the
new
will
bound
to
come
unless
you
do
something
she
cares
too
much
for
you
bobby
to
see
you
throw
everything
away
she
asked
me
to
persuade
you
to
go
out
why
did
she
write
to
me
have
you
been
very
friendly
with
katherine
lately
and
that
not
fair
you
both
without
parents
you
owe
katherine
something
on
that
account
bobby
did
answer
because
it
was
clear
that
while
affection
for
him
had
weakened
her
friendship
for
graham
had
grown
too
fast
looking
at
the
other
he
did
wonder
there
another
thing
graham
was
saying
the
gloomy
old
cedars
has
got
on
katherine
nerves
and
she
says
there
been
a
change
in
the
old
man
the
last
few
days
wanders
around
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
something
bobby
laughed
outright
him
afraid
of
something
it
always
been
his
system
to
make
everybody
and
everything
afraid
of
him
but
you
right
about
katherine
we
have
always
depended
on
each
other
i
think
i
go
out
after
dinner
then
come
have
a
bite
with
me
graham
urged
i
see
you
off
afterward
if
you
catch
the
you
ought
to
be
out
there
before
ten
bobby
shook
his
head
an
engagement
for
dinner
hartley
i
expecting
carlos
paredes
to
pick
me
up
here
any
minute
graham
disapproval
was
belligerent
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
bobby
do
you
run
around
with
that
damned
panamanian
steer
him
off
i
argued
with
you
before
unpleasant
i
know
but
the
man
carries
every
mark
of
crookedness
easy
with
my
friends
hartley
you
do
understand
carlos
he
good
fun
when
you
know
him
awfully
good
fun
so
graham
said
is
this
sort
of
thing
too
many
cocktails
too
much
wine
paredes
has
the
same
pleasant
dangerous
quality
a
club
servant
entered
in
the
reception
room
mr
blackburn
bobby
took
the
card
tore
it
into
little
bits
and
dropped
them
one
by
one
into
the
basket
tell
him
i
be
right
out
he
turned
to
graham
sorry
you
do
like
my
playmates
i
probably
run
out
after
dinner
and
let
the
old
man
terrorize
me
as
a
cure
for
his
own
fear
pleasant
prospect
so
long
graham
caught
at
his
arm
i
sorry
ca
we
forget
that
we
disagree
about
paredes
let
me
dine
with
you
bobby
laugh
was
uncomfortable
come
on
if
you
wish
and
be
my
guardian
angel
god
knows
i
need
one
he
walked
across
the
hall
and
into
the
reception
room
the
light
was
not
brilliant
there
one
or
two
men
sat
reading
newspapers
about
a
lamp
on
the
centre
table
but
bobby
did
see
paredes
at
first
then
from
the
obscurity
of
a
corner
a
form
tall
and
graceful
emerged
with
a
slow
monotony
of
movement
suggestive
of
stealth
the
dark
sombre
eyes
revealed
nothing
his
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
his
carefully
trimmed
van
dyke
beard
gave
him
an
air
of
distinction
an
air
at
the
same
time
a
trifle
too
reserved
for
a
moment
as
the
green
light
stained
his
face
unhealthily
bobby
could
understand
graham
aversion
he
brushed
the
idea
aside
glad
you
come
carlos
the
smile
of
greeting
vanished
abruptly
from
paredes
face
he
looked
with
steady
eyes
beyond
bobby
shoulder
bobby
turned
graham
stood
on
the
threshold
his
face
a
little
too
frank
but
the
two
men
shook
hands
i
an
idea
until
i
saw
bobby
graham
said
that
you
gone
back
to
panama
paredes
yawned
each
year
i
spend
more
time
in
new
york
business
suggests
it
pleasure
demands
it
his
voice
was
deep
and
pleasant
but
bobby
had
often
remarked
that
it
like
paredes
eyes
was
too
reserved
it
seemed
never
to
call
on
its
obvious
powers
of
expression
its
accent
was
noticeable
only
in
a
pleasant
polished
sense
hartley
bobby
explained
is
dining
with
us
paredes
let
no
disapproval
slip
but
graham
hastened
to
explain
bobby
and
i
have
an
engagement
immediately
after
dinner
an
engagement
after
dinner
i
did
understand
let
think
of
dinner
first
bobby
said
we
can
talk
about
engagements
afterward
perhaps
you
have
a
cocktail
here
while
we
decide
where
we
going
the
aperitif
i
should
like
very
much
paredes
said
about
dinner
there
is
nothing
to
decide
i
have
arranged
everything
there
a
table
waiting
in
the
fountain
room
at
the
c
and
there
i
have
planned
a
little
surprise
for
you
he
would
explain
further
while
they
drank
their
cocktails
bobby
watched
graham
disapproval
grow
the
man
glanced
continually
at
his
watch
in
the
restaurant
when
paredes
left
them
to
produce
as
he
called
it
his
surprise
graham
appraised
with
a
frown
the
voluble
people
who
moved
intricately
through
the
hall
i
afraid
paredes
has
planned
a
thorough
evening
he
said
for
which
he
want
you
to
pay
do
be
angry
bobby
the
situation
is
serious
enough
to
excuse
facts
you
must
go
to
the
cedars
do
you
understand
you
must
go
in
spite
of
paredes
in
spite
of
everything
peace
until
train
time
bobby
demanded
he
caught
his
breath
there
they
are
carlos
kept
his
word
see
her
hartley
glorious
a
young
woman
accompanied
the
panamanian
as
he
came
back
through
the
hall
she
appeared
more
foreign
than
her
guide
the
spanish
of
spain
rather
than
of
south
america
her
clothing
was
as
unusual
and
striking
as
her
beauty
yet
one
felt
there
was
more
than
either
to
attract
all
the
glances
in
this
room
to
set
people
whispering
as
she
passed
clearly
she
knew
her
notoriety
was
no
little
thing
pride
filled
her
eyes
paredes
had
first
introduced
her
to
bobby
a
month
or
more
ago
he
had
seen
her
a
number
of
times
since
in
her
at
the
theatre
where
she
was
featured
or
at
crowded
luncheons
in
her
apartment
at
such
moments
she
had
managed
to
be
exceptionally
nice
to
him
bobby
however
had
answered
merely
to
the
glamour
of
her
fame
to
the
magnetic
response
her
beauty
always
brought
in
places
like
this
paredes
graham
muttered
will
have
a
powerful
ally
you
wo
fail
me
bobby
you
will
go
bobby
scarcely
heard
he
hurried
forward
and
welcomed
the
woman
she
tapped
his
arm
with
her
fan
leetle
bobby
she
lisped
i
have
seen
very
much
of
you
lately
so
when
carlos
proposed
you
see
i
do
dance
until
late
who
is
that
behind
you
graham
is
it
not
he
would
maybe
not
remember
me
i
danced
at
a
dinner
where
you
were
one
night
at
ward
even
lawyers
i
find
take
enjoyment
in
my
dancing
i
remember
graham
said
it
is
very
pleasant
we
are
to
dine
together
he
continued
tactlessly
but
as
i
explained
to
paredes
we
must
hurry
bobby
and
i
have
an
early
engagement
her
head
went
up
an
early
engagement
i
do
not
often
dine
in
public
an
unavoidable
thing
graham
explained
bobby
will
tell
you
bobby
nodded
it
a
nuisance
particularly
when
you
so
condescending
maria
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
bobby
she
entered
the
at
the
heels
of
paredes
and
graham
paredes
had
foreseen
everything
there
were
flowers
on
the
table
the
dinner
had
been
ordered
immediately
the
waiter
brought
cocktails
graham
glanced
at
bobby
warningly
he
would
as
an
example
bobby
appreciated
touch
his
own
maria
held
hers
up
to
the
light
pretty
yellow
things
i
never
drink
them
she
smiled
dreamily
at
bobby
but
see
i
shall
place
this
to
my
lips
in
order
that
you
may
make
pretty
speeches
and
maybe
tell
me
it
is
the
most
divine
aperitif
you
have
ever
drunk
she
passed
the
glass
to
him
and
bobby
avoiding
graham
eyes
wondering
why
she
was
so
gracious
emptied
it
and
afterward
frequently
she
reminded
him
of
his
wine
by
going
through
the
same
elaborate
formula
probably
because
of
that
as
much
as
anything
else
constraint
grasped
the
little
company
tighter
graham
could
hide
his
anxiety
paredes
mocked
it
with
sneering
phrases
which
he
turned
most
carefully
before
the
meal
was
half
finished
graham
glanced
at
his
watch
we
just
time
for
the
he
whispered
to
bobby
if
we
pick
up
a
taxi
maria
had
heard
she
pouted
there
is
no
engagement
she
lisped
as
sacred
as
a
dinner
no
entanglement
except
marriage
that
can
not
be
easily
broken
perhaps
i
have
displeased
you
graham
perhaps
you
fancy
i
excite
unpleasant
comment
it
is
unjust
i
assure
you
my
reputation
is
above
reproach
her
dark
eyes
twinkled
certainly
in
new
york
it
is
that
graham
answered
we
must
go
it
not
to
be
evaded
she
turned
tempestuously
am
i
to
be
humiliated
so
carlos
why
did
you
bring
me
is
all
the
world
to
see
my
companions
leave
in
the
midst
of
a
dinner
as
if
i
were
is
bobby
not
capable
of
choosing
his
own
company
you
are
thoroughly
justified
maria
paredes
said
in
his
expressionless
tones
bobby
however
has
said
very
little
about
this
engagement
i
did
not
know
graham
that
you
were
the
arbiter
of
bobby
actions
in
a
way
i
must
resent
your
implication
that
he
is
no
longer
capable
of
caring
for
himself
graham
accepted
the
challenge
he
leaned
across
the
table
speaking
directly
to
bobby
ignoring
the
others
you
not
forgotten
what
i
told
you
will
you
come
while
there
time
you
must
see
i
ca
remain
here
any
longer
bobby
hating
warfare
in
his
present
mood
sought
to
temporize
it
all
right
hartley
do
worry
i
catch
a
later
train
maria
relaxed
ah
bobby
still
chooses
for
himself
i
have
enough
rumpus
bobby
muttered
when
i
get
to
the
cedars
do
grudge
me
a
little
peace
here
graham
arose
his
voice
was
discouraged
i
sorry
i
hope
bobby
without
a
word
to
the
others
he
walked
out
of
the
room
so
far
when
bobby
tried
afterward
to
recall
the
details
of
the
evening
everything
was
perfectly
distinct
in
his
memory
the
remainder
of
the
meal
made
uncomfortable
by
maria
sullenness
and
paredes
sneers
his
attempt
to
recapture
the
earlier
gayety
of
the
evening
by
continuing
to
drink
the
wine
his
determination
to
go
later
to
the
cedars
in
spite
of
graham
doubt
of
all
these
things
no
particular
lacked
he
remembered
paying
the
check
as
he
usually
did
when
he
dined
with
paredes
he
recalled
studying
the
and
finding
that
he
had
just
missed
another
train
maria
spirits
rose
then
he
was
persuaded
to
accompany
her
and
paredes
to
the
music
hall
in
her
while
she
was
on
the
stage
he
played
with
the
boxes
of
splashing
the
mirror
with
various
colours
while
paredes
sat
silently
watching
the
alteration
he
was
sure
came
a
little
later
in
the
cafe
at
a
table
close
to
the
dancing
floor
maria
had
insisted
that
paredes
and
he
should
wait
there
while
she
changed
but
he
had
protested
i
have
missed
too
many
trains
she
had
demanded
his
scanning
the
columns
of
close
figures
there
is
one
she
had
said
at
time
for
a
little
something
in
the
cafe
and
who
knows
if
you
are
agreeable
i
might
forgive
everything
and
dance
with
you
once
bobby
on
the
public
floor
so
he
sat
for
some
time
expectant
with
paredes
watching
the
boisterous
dancers
listening
to
the
violent
music
sipping
at
his
glass
he
wondered
why
paredes
had
grown
so
quiet
i
must
miss
that
he
said
you
know
carlos
you
were
quite
fair
to
hartley
he
a
splendid
fellow
roomed
with
me
at
college
played
on
same
team
and
all
that
only
wanted
me
to
do
the
right
thing
must
say
it
was
the
right
thing
i
wo
miss
that
graham
paredes
sneered
is
a
wonderful
type
apollo
in
the
flesh
and
billy
sunday
in
the
conscience
then
as
bobby
started
to
protest
maria
entered
more
dazzling
than
at
dinner
and
the
dancers
swayed
less
boisterously
the
chatter
at
the
tables
subsided
the
orchestra
seemed
to
hesitate
as
a
sort
of
obeisance
a
man
bobby
had
never
seen
before
followed
her
to
the
table
his
figure
was
loudly
clothed
his
face
was
coarse
and
clean
shaven
he
acknowledged
the
introductions
sullenly
i
only
a
minute
bobby
said
to
maria
he
continued
however
to
raise
his
glass
indifferently
to
his
lips
all
at
once
his
glass
shook
maria
dark
and
sparkling
face
became
blurred
he
could
no
longer
define
the
features
of
the
stranger
he
had
never
before
experienced
anything
of
the
kind
he
tried
to
account
for
it
but
his
mind
became
confused
maria
he
burst
out
why
are
you
looking
at
me
like
that
her
contralto
laugh
rippled
bobby
looks
so
funny
carlos
leetle
bobby
looks
so
queer
what
is
the
matter
with
him
bobby
anger
was
lost
in
the
increased
confusion
of
his
senses
but
through
that
mental
turmoil
tore
the
thought
of
graham
and
his
intention
of
going
to
the
cedars
with
shaking
fingers
he
dragged
out
his
watch
he
could
read
the
dial
he
braced
his
hands
against
the
table
thrust
back
his
chair
and
arose
the
room
tumbled
about
him
before
his
eyes
the
dancers
made
long
nebulous
bands
of
colour
in
which
nothing
had
form
or
coherence
instinctively
he
felt
he
had
dined
recklessly
enough
to
account
for
these
amazing
symptoms
he
was
suddenly
afraid
carlos
he
whispered
he
heard
maria
voice
dimly
take
him
home
a
hand
touched
his
arm
with
a
supreme
effort
of
will
he
walked
from
the
room
guided
by
the
hand
on
his
arm
and
always
his
brain
recorded
fewer
and
fewer
impressions
for
his
memory
to
struggle
with
later
at
the
cloak
room
some
one
helped
him
put
on
his
coat
he
was
walking
down
steps
he
was
in
some
kind
of
a
conveyance
he
did
know
what
it
was
an
automobile
a
carriage
a
train
he
did
know
he
only
understood
that
it
went
swiftly
swaying
from
side
to
side
through
a
sable
pit
whenever
his
mind
moved
at
all
it
came
back
to
that
sensation
of
a
black
pit
in
which
he
remained
suspended
swinging
from
side
to
side
trying
to
struggle
up
against
impossible
odds
once
or
twice
words
flashed
like
fire
through
the
pit
tyrant
fool
to
go
from
a
long
immersion
deeper
in
the
pit
he
struggled
frantically
he
must
get
out
somehow
he
must
find
wings
he
realized
that
his
eyes
were
closed
he
tried
to
open
them
and
failed
so
the
pit
persisted
and
he
surrendered
himself
as
one
accepts
death
to
its
hateful
blackness
abruptly
he
experienced
a
momentary
release
there
was
no
more
swaying
no
more
movement
of
any
kind
he
heard
a
strange
melancholy
voice
whispering
without
words
always
whispering
with
a
futile
perseverance
as
if
it
wished
him
to
understand
something
it
could
not
express
what
is
it
trying
to
tell
me
he
asked
himself
then
he
understood
it
was
the
voice
of
the
wind
and
it
tried
to
tell
him
to
open
his
eyes
and
he
found
that
he
could
but
in
spite
of
his
desire
they
closed
again
almost
immediately
yet
from
that
swift
glimpse
a
picture
outlined
itself
later
in
his
memory
in
the
midst
of
wild
rolling
clouds
the
moon
was
a
drowning
face
stunted
trees
bent
before
the
wind
like
puny
men
who
strained
impotently
to
advance
over
there
was
one
more
like
a
real
man
a
figure
bobby
thought
with
a
black
thing
over
its
face
a
mask
this
is
the
forest
near
the
cedars
bobby
said
to
himself
i
come
to
face
the
old
devil
after
all
he
heard
his
own
voice
harsh
remote
unnatural
speaking
to
the
dim
figure
with
a
black
mask
that
waited
half
hidden
by
the
straining
trees
why
am
i
here
in
the
woods
near
the
cedars
and
he
thought
the
thing
answered
because
you
hate
your
grandfather
bobby
laughed
thinking
he
understood
the
figure
in
the
black
mask
that
accompanied
him
was
his
conscience
he
could
understand
why
it
went
masked
the
wind
resumed
its
whispering
the
figures
straining
like
puny
men
fought
harder
the
drowning
face
disappeared
wet
and
helpless
bobby
felt
himself
sinking
back
back
into
the
sable
pit
i
do
want
to
go
he
moaned
a
long
time
afterward
he
heard
a
whisper
again
and
he
wondered
if
it
was
the
wind
or
his
conscience
he
laughed
through
the
blackness
because
the
words
seemed
so
absurd
take
off
your
shoes
and
carry
them
in
your
hand
always
do
that
it
is
the
only
safe
way
he
laughed
again
thinking
what
a
careful
conscience
he
retained
only
one
more
impression
he
was
dully
aware
that
some
time
had
passed
he
shivered
he
thought
the
wind
had
grown
angry
with
him
for
it
no
longer
whispered
it
shrieked
and
he
could
make
nothing
of
its
wrath
he
struggled
frantically
to
emerge
from
the
pit
the
quality
of
the
blackness
deepened
his
fright
grew
he
felt
himself
slipping
slowly
at
first
then
faster
faster
down
into
impossible
depths
and
there
was
nothing
at
all
he
could
do
to
save
himself
go
away
for
god
sake
go
away
bobby
thought
he
was
speaking
to
the
sombre
figure
in
the
mask
his
voice
aroused
him
to
one
more
effort
at
escape
but
he
felt
that
there
was
no
use
he
was
too
deep
something
hurt
his
eyes
he
opened
them
and
for
a
time
was
blinded
by
a
narrow
shaft
of
sunlight
resting
on
his
face
with
an
effort
he
moved
his
head
to
one
side
and
closed
his
eyes
again
at
first
merely
thankful
that
he
had
escaped
from
the
black
hell
trying
to
control
his
sensations
of
physical
evil
subtle
curiosity
forced
its
way
into
his
sick
brain
and
stung
him
wide
awake
this
time
his
eyes
remained
open
staring
about
him
dilating
with
a
wilder
fright
than
he
had
experienced
in
the
dark
mazes
of
his
nightmare
adventure
he
had
never
seen
this
place
before
he
lay
on
the
floor
of
an
empty
room
the
shaft
of
sunlight
that
had
aroused
him
entered
through
a
crack
in
one
of
the
tightly
drawn
blinds
there
were
dust
and
grime
on
the
wails
and
cobwebs
clustered
in
the
corners
in
the
silent
deserted
room
the
beating
of
his
heart
became
audible
he
struggled
to
a
sitting
posture
he
gasped
for
breath
he
knew
it
was
very
cold
in
here
but
perspiration
moistened
his
face
he
could
recall
no
such
suffering
as
this
since
when
a
boy
he
had
slipped
from
the
crisis
of
a
destructive
fever
had
he
been
drugged
but
he
had
been
with
friends
there
was
no
motive
what
house
was
this
was
it
like
this
room
empty
and
deserted
how
had
he
come
here
for
the
first
time
he
went
through
that
dreadful
process
of
trying
to
draw
from
the
black
pit
useful
memories
he
started
recalling
the
strange
voice
and
its
warning
for
his
shoes
lay
near
by
as
though
he
might
have
dropped
them
carelessly
when
he
had
entered
the
room
and
stretched
himself
on
the
floor
damp
earth
adhered
to
the
soles
the
leather
above
was
scratched
then
he
thought
that
much
is
right
i
was
in
the
woods
what
was
i
doing
there
that
dim
figure
my
imagination
he
suffered
the
agony
of
a
man
who
realizes
that
he
has
wandered
unawares
in
strange
places
and
retains
no
recollection
of
his
actions
of
his
intentions
he
went
back
to
that
last
unclouded
moment
in
the
cafe
with
maria
paredes
and
the
stranger
where
had
he
gone
after
he
had
left
them
he
had
looked
at
his
watch
he
had
told
himself
he
must
catch
the
train
he
must
have
gone
from
the
restaurant
proceeding
automatically
and
caught
the
train
that
would
account
for
the
sensation
of
motion
in
a
swift
vehicle
and
perhaps
there
had
been
a
taxicab
to
the
station
doubtless
in
the
woods
near
the
cedars
he
had
decided
it
was
too
late
to
go
in
or
that
it
was
wiser
not
to
he
had
answered
to
the
necessity
of
sleeping
somewhere
but
why
had
he
come
here
where
indeed
was
he
at
least
he
could
answer
that
he
drew
on
his
shoes
a
pair
of
patent
leather
pumps
he
fumbled
for
his
handkerchief
thinking
he
would
brush
the
earth
from
them
he
searched
each
of
his
pockets
his
handkerchief
was
gone
no
matter
he
got
to
his
feet
lurching
for
a
moment
dizzily
he
glanced
with
distaste
at
his
rumpled
evening
clothing
to
hide
it
as
far
as
possible
he
buttoned
his
overcoat
collar
about
his
neck
on
he
approached
the
door
and
with
the
emotions
of
a
thief
opened
it
quietly
he
sighed
the
rest
of
the
house
was
as
empty
as
this
room
the
hall
was
thick
with
dust
the
rear
door
by
which
he
must
have
entered
stood
half
open
the
lock
was
broken
and
rusty
he
commenced
to
understand
there
was
a
deserted
farmhouse
less
than
two
miles
from
the
cedars
since
he
had
always
known
about
it
it
unusual
he
should
have
taken
shelter
there
after
deciding
not
to
go
in
to
his
grandfather
he
stepped
through
the
doorway
to
the
unkempt
yard
about
whose
tumbled
fences
the
woods
advanced
thickly
he
recognized
the
place
for
some
time
he
stood
ashamed
yet
fair
enough
to
seek
the
cause
of
his
experience
in
some
mental
unhealth
deeper
than
any
reaction
from
last
night
folly
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
after
two
the
mournful
neighbourhood
the
growing
chill
in
the
air
the
sullen
sky
urged
him
away
he
walked
down
the
road
of
course
he
could
go
to
the
cedars
in
this
condition
he
would
return
to
his
apartment
in
new
york
where
he
could
bathe
change
his
clothes
recover
from
this
feeling
of
physical
ill
and
remember
perhaps
something
more
it
was
far
to
the
little
village
on
the
railroad
and
at
this
hour
there
were
plenty
of
trains
he
hoped
no
one
he
knew
would
see
him
at
the
station
he
smiled
wearily
what
difference
did
that
make
he
might
as
well
face
old
blackburn
himself
as
he
was
by
this
time
the
thing
was
done
the
new
will
had
been
made
he
was
penniless
and
an
outcast
but
his
furtive
manner
clung
he
did
want
katherine
to
see
him
like
this
from
the
entrance
of
the
village
it
was
only
a
few
steps
to
the
station
several
carriages
stood
at
the
platform
testimony
that
a
train
was
nearly
due
he
prayed
that
it
would
be
for
new
york
he
did
want
to
wait
around
he
did
want
to
risk
katherine
driving
in
on
some
errand
his
mind
intent
only
on
escaping
prying
eyes
was
drawn
by
a
man
who
stepped
from
behind
a
carriage
and
started
across
the
roadway
in
his
direction
staring
at
him
incredulously
his
quick
apprehension
vanished
he
could
recall
that
surprised
face
there
was
no
harm
being
seen
miserable
as
he
was
dressed
as
he
was
by
this
stranger
he
looked
at
him
closer
the
man
was
plainly
clothed
he
had
small
sharp
eyes
his
hairless
face
was
intricately
wrinkled
his
lips
were
thin
making
a
straight
line
to
avoid
him
bobby
stepped
aside
thinking
he
must
be
going
past
but
the
stranger
stopped
and
placed
a
firm
hand
on
bobby
shoulder
he
spoke
in
a
quick
authoritative
voice
certainly
you
are
robert
blackburn
for
bobby
in
his
nervous
bewildered
condition
there
was
an
ominous
note
in
this
surprise
this
assurance
this
peremptory
greeting
what
amazing
about
that
he
jerked
out
the
stranger
lips
parted
in
a
straight
smile
amazing
that
the
word
i
was
thinking
of
hoped
you
might
come
in
from
new
york
seemed
you
were
here
all
the
time
that
a
good
one
on
me
a
very
good
one
the
beating
of
bobby
heart
was
more
pronounced
than
it
had
been
in
the
deserted
house
he
asked
himself
why
he
should
shrink
from
this
stranger
who
had
an
air
of
threatening
him
the
answer
lay
in
that
black
pit
of
last
night
and
this
morning
unquestionably
he
had
been
indiscreet
the
man
would
tell
him
how
you
mean
he
asked
with
dry
lips
that
you
been
looking
for
me
who
are
you
please
take
your
hand
off
the
stranger
grasp
tightened
not
so
fast
robert
blackburn
i
daresay
you
have
just
now
come
from
the
cedars
no
no
i
on
my
way
to
new
york
there
a
train
soon
i
think
his
voice
trailed
away
the
stranger
straight
smile
widened
he
commenced
to
laugh
harshly
and
uncouthly
sure
there
a
train
but
you
do
want
to
take
it
and
why
you
been
at
the
cedars
grandpa
death
grieved
you
too
much
to
go
near
his
body
bobby
drew
back
the
shock
robbed
him
for
a
moment
of
the
power
to
reason
dead
the
old
man
how
the
stranger
smile
faded
here
it
is
nearly
three
in
the
afternoon
and
you
all
dressed
up
for
last
night
that
lucky
bobby
could
meet
the
narrow
eyes
who
are
you
the
stranger
with
his
free
hand
threw
back
his
coat
lapel
my
name
howells
i
a
county
detective
i
on
the
case
because
your
grandfather
died
very
strangely
he
was
murdered
very
cleverly
murdered
queerest
case
i
ever
handled
what
do
you
think
in
his
own
ears
bobby
voice
sounded
as
remote
and
unreal
as
it
had
through
the
blackness
last
night
why
do
you
talk
to
me
like
this
because
i
tell
you
i
on
the
case
and
i
want
you
to
turn
about
and
go
straight
to
the
cedars
this
is
absurd
you
mean
you
suspect
you
placing
me
under
arrest
the
detective
straight
smile
returned
how
we
jump
at
conclusions
i
simply
telling
you
not
to
bother
me
with
questions
i
telling
you
to
go
straight
to
the
cedars
where
you
stay
understand
you
stay
there
until
you
wanted
until
you
wanted
the
merciless
repetition
settled
it
for
bobby
he
knew
it
would
be
dangerous
to
talk
or
argue
moreover
he
craved
an
opportunity
to
think
to
probe
farther
into
the
black
pit
he
turned
and
walked
away
when
he
reached
the
last
houses
he
glanced
back
the
detective
remained
in
the
middle
of
the
road
staring
after
him
with
that
straight
and
satisfied
smile
bobby
walked
on
his
shaking
hands
tightly
clenched
muttering
to
himself
i
got
to
remember
good
god
i
got
to
remember
it
the
only
way
i
can
ever
know
he
not
right
that
i
not
a
murderer
chapter
ii
the
case
against
bobby
bobby
hurried
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
cedars
always
he
tried
desperately
to
recall
what
had
occurred
during
those
black
hours
last
night
and
this
morning
before
he
had
awakened
in
the
empty
house
near
his
grandfather
home
all
that
remained
were
his
sensation
of
travel
in
a
swift
vehicle
his
impression
of
standing
in
the
forest
near
the
cedars
his
glimpse
of
the
masked
figure
which
he
had
called
his
conscience
the
echo
in
his
brain
of
a
voice
saying
take
off
your
shoes
and
carry
them
in
your
hand
always
do
that
it
the
only
safe
way
these
facts
then
alone
were
clear
to
him
he
had
wandered
unconscious
in
the
neighbourhood
his
grandfather
had
been
strangely
murdered
the
detective
who
had
met
him
in
the
village
practically
accused
him
of
the
murder
and
he
could
remember
he
turned
back
to
his
last
clear
recollections
when
he
had
experienced
his
first
symptoms
of
slipping
consciousness
he
had
been
in
the
cafe
in
new
york
with
carlos
paredes
maria
the
dancer
and
a
strange
man
whom
maria
had
brought
to
the
table
through
them
he
might
to
an
extent
trace
his
movements
unless
they
had
put
him
in
a
cab
thinking
he
would
catch
the
train
of
which
he
had
talked
for
the
cedars
already
the
forest
crowded
the
narrow
curving
road
the
blackburn
place
was
in
the
midst
of
an
arid
thicket
of
stunted
pines
oaks
and
cedars
old
blackburn
had
never
done
anything
to
improve
the
estate
or
its
surroundings
steadily
during
his
lifetime
it
had
grown
more
gloomy
less
habitable
with
the
silent
forest
thick
about
him
bobby
realized
that
he
was
no
longer
alone
a
crackling
twig
or
a
loose
stone
struck
by
a
foot
might
have
warned
him
he
went
slower
glancing
restlessly
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
no
one
but
that
idea
of
stealthy
pursuit
persisted
undoubtedly
it
was
the
detective
howells
who
followed
him
hoping
perhaps
that
he
would
make
some
mad
effort
at
escape
that
he
muttered
is
probably
the
reason
he
did
arrest
me
at
the
station
bobby
however
had
no
thought
of
escape
he
was
impatient
to
reach
the
cedars
where
he
might
learn
all
that
howells
had
told
him
about
his
grandfather
death
a
high
wooden
fence
straggled
through
the
forest
the
driveway
swung
from
the
road
through
a
broad
gateway
the
gate
stood
open
bobby
remembered
that
it
had
been
old
blackburn
habit
to
keep
it
closed
he
entered
and
hurried
among
the
trees
to
the
edge
of
the
lawn
in
the
centre
of
which
the
house
stood
feeling
as
guilty
as
the
detective
thought
him
he
paused
there
and
examined
the
house
for
some
sign
of
life
at
first
it
seemed
as
dead
as
the
forest
stripped
by
autumn
almost
as
gloomy
and
arid
as
the
wilderness
which
straggled
close
about
it
he
had
no
eye
for
the
symmetry
of
its
wings
which
formed
the
court
in
the
centre
of
which
an
abandoned
fountain
stood
he
studied
the
windows
picturing
katherine
alone
surrounded
by
the
complications
of
this
unexpected
tragedy
his
feeling
of
an
inimical
watchfulness
persisted
a
clicking
sound
swung
him
back
to
the
house
the
front
door
had
been
opened
and
in
the
black
frame
of
the
doorway
as
he
looked
katherine
and
graham
appeared
and
he
knew
the
resolution
of
his
last
doubt
was
at
hand
katherine
had
thrown
a
cloak
over
her
graceful
figure
her
sunny
hair
strayed
in
the
wind
but
her
face
while
it
had
lost
nothing
of
its
beauty
projected
even
at
this
distance
a
sense
of
weariness
of
anxiety
of
utter
fear
bobby
was
grateful
for
graham
presence
it
was
like
the
man
to
assume
his
responsibilities
to
sacrifice
himself
in
his
service
he
straightened
he
must
meet
these
two
through
his
own
wretched
appearance
and
position
he
must
develop
for
katherine
more
clearly
than
ever
graham
superiority
he
stepped
out
calling
softly
katherine
she
started
she
turned
in
his
direction
and
came
swiftly
toward
him
she
spread
her
hands
bobby
bobby
where
have
you
been
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
they
were
like
tears
that
have
been
too
long
coming
he
took
her
hands
her
fingers
were
cold
they
twitched
in
his
look
at
me
katherine
he
said
hoarsely
i
sorry
graham
came
up
he
spoke
with
apparent
difficulty
you
not
been
home
then
what
happened
last
night
quick
tell
us
what
you
did
everything
i
seen
the
detective
he
answered
he
told
you
too
be
careful
i
think
he
back
there
watching
and
listening
katherine
freed
her
hands
the
tears
had
dried
she
shook
a
little
then
you
were
at
the
station
she
said
you
must
have
come
from
new
york
but
i
tried
so
hard
to
get
you
there
for
hours
i
telephoned
and
telegraphed
then
i
got
hartley
come
away
from
the
trees
so
we
can
talk
without
without
being
overheard
as
they
moved
to
the
centre
of
the
open
space
graham
indicated
evening
clothes
why
are
you
dressed
like
that
bobby
you
come
from
town
you
can
tell
us
everything
you
did
last
night
after
i
left
you
and
early
this
morning
bobby
shook
his
head
his
answer
was
reluctant
i
did
come
from
new
york
just
now
i
was
evidently
here
last
night
and
i
ca
remember
hartley
i
remember
scarcely
anything
graham
face
whitened
tell
us
he
begged
you
got
to
remember
katherine
cried
bobby
as
minutely
as
he
could
recited
the
few
impressions
that
remained
from
last
night
when
he
had
finished
graham
thought
for
some
time
paredes
and
the
dancer
he
said
at
last
practically
forced
me
away
from
you
last
night
it
obvious
bobby
you
must
have
been
drugged
bobby
shook
his
head
i
thought
of
that
right
away
but
it
wo
do
if
i
had
been
drugged
i
would
have
moved
around
and
i
did
come
out
somehow
i
managed
to
get
to
the
empty
house
to
sleep
it
more
as
if
my
mind
had
simply
closed
as
if
it
had
gone
on
working
its
own
ends
without
my
knowing
anything
about
it
and
that
dreadful
because
the
detective
has
practically
accused
me
of
murdering
my
grandfather
how
was
it
done
you
see
i
know
nothing
tell
me
how
how
he
was
killed
i
ca
believe
i
i
such
a
beast
tell
me
if
i
was
in
the
house
some
detail
might
start
my
memory
so
katherine
told
her
story
while
bobby
listened
shrinking
from
some
disclosure
that
would
convict
him
as
she
went
on
however
his
sense
of
bewilderment
increased
and
when
she
had
finished
he
burst
out
but
where
is
the
proof
of
murder
where
is
there
even
a
suggestion
you
say
the
doors
were
locked
and
he
does
show
a
mark
that
what
we
ca
understand
graham
said
there
no
evidence
we
know
anything
about
that
your
grandfather
heart
did
simply
give
out
but
the
detective
is
absolutely
certain
and
there
no
use
mincing
matters
bobby
he
believes
he
has
the
proof
to
convict
you
he
tell
me
what
he
simply
smiles
and
refuses
to
talk
the
motive
bobby
asked
graham
looked
at
him
curiously
katherine
turned
away
of
course
bobby
cried
with
a
sharpened
discomfort
i
forgotten
the
money
the
new
will
he
had
planned
to
make
the
money
mine
now
but
if
he
had
lived
until
this
morning
it
never
would
have
been
i
see
it
is
a
powerful
motive
graham
said
for
any
one
who
know
you
but
bobby
answered
howells
has
got
to
prove
first
that
my
grandfather
was
murdered
the
autopsy
coroner
out
of
the
county
graham
replied
and
howells
wo
have
an
assistant
groom
waiting
in
the
house
we
expecting
the
coroner
almost
any
time
bobby
spoke
rapidly
if
he
calls
it
murder
hartley
there
one
thing
we
got
to
find
out
what
my
grandfather
was
afraid
of
tell
me
again
katherine
everything
he
said
about
me
i
ca
believe
he
could
have
been
afraid
of
me
he
called
you
katherine
answered
a
waster
he
said
knows
what
he
do
next
he
said
he
ordered
you
out
last
night
and
he
had
a
word
from
you
but
that
he
made
up
his
mind
anyway
he
was
going
to
have
his
lawyer
this
morning
and
change
his
will
leaving
all
his
money
to
the
bedford
foundation
except
a
little
annuity
for
me
he
grew
sentimental
and
said
he
had
no
faith
left
in
his
flesh
and
blood
and
that
it
was
sad
to
grow
old
with
nobody
caring
for
him
except
to
covet
his
money
i
asked
him
if
he
were
afraid
of
you
and
all
he
answered
was
and
bobby
are
thicker
than
thieves
oh
yes
when
i
saw
him
for
the
last
time
in
the
hall
he
said
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
worry
about
except
you
that
all
i
remember
perfectly
he
said
nothing
more
about
you
i
wonder
bobby
muttered
if
a
jury
would
think
it
enough
katherine
shook
her
head
there
seemed
so
much
more
than
that
behind
his
fear
she
said
as
told
you
he
gave
me
a
feeling
of
superstition
i
never
once
was
afraid
of
a
murderer
of
a
man
in
the
house
i
was
afraid
of
something
queer
and
active
but
not
human
bobby
straightened
would
you
he
asked
call
a
man
going
about
in
an
aphasia
quite
human
somnambulists
do
unaccountable
things
such
as
overcoming
locked
doors
do
bobby
do
katherine
cried
sh
h
quiet
graham
warned
a
foot
scraped
on
gravel
maybe
the
detective
bobby
suggested
he
stared
at
the
bend
expecting
to
see
the
stiff
plain
figure
of
the
detective
emerge
from
the
forest
instead
with
a
dawning
amazement
he
watched
carlos
paredes
stroll
into
view
the
panamanian
was
calm
and
immaculate
his
van
dyke
beard
was
neatly
trimmed
and
combed
as
he
advanced
he
puffed
in
leisurely
fashion
at
a
cigarette
graham
flushed
after
last
night
he
has
the
nerve
be
decent
to
him
bobby
urged
he
might
help
me
might
clear
up
last
night
i
wonder
graham
mused
to
what
extent
he
could
clear
it
up
if
he
wished
paredes
threw
his
cigarette
away
as
he
came
closer
solemnly
he
shook
hands
with
katherine
and
bobby
expressing
a
profound
sympathy
even
then
bobby
remarked
that
those
reserved
features
let
slip
no
positive
emotion
the
man
turned
to
graham
our
little
difference
of
last
evening
he
said
suavely
will
i
hope
evaporate
in
this
atmosphere
of
unexpected
sorrow
if
i
was
in
the
wrong
i
deeply
regret
it
my
one
wish
now
is
to
join
you
in
being
of
use
to
bobby
and
miss
katherine
in
their
bereavement
i
saw
the
account
in
a
paper
at
luncheon
i
came
as
quickly
as
possible
graham
answered
this
smooth
effrontery
with
a
blunt
question
do
you
know
that
bobby
is
in
very
real
trouble
that
he
may
be
implicated
in
blackburn
death
paredes
flung
up
his
hands
but
bobby
looking
for
emotion
in
the
sallow
face
then
found
none
paredes
features
it
occurred
to
him
were
exactly
like
a
mask
bobby
checked
himself
in
his
unhealthy
way
paredes
had
been
a
good
friend
the
man
voice
flowed
smoothly
demanding
particulars
but
this
he
said
when
they
had
told
him
what
they
could
changes
the
situation
i
must
stay
here
i
must
watch
that
detective
and
learn
what
he
has
up
his
sleeve
graham
turned
away
i
tried
maybe
you
succeed
better
than
i
then
you
excuse
me
paredes
said
quickly
i
should
like
your
permission
to
telephone
to
my
hotel
in
new
york
for
some
clothing
i
want
to
see
this
through
the
three
looked
at
each
other
katherine
and
graham
seemed
about
to
speak
bobby
would
let
them
carlos
he
said
you
might
help
me
i
almost
afraid
to
ask
what
happened
in
the
cafe
last
night
the
last
thing
i
remember
distinctly
is
sitting
there
with
you
and
maria
and
a
stranger
she
had
introduced
i
did
get
his
name
what
did
i
do
did
any
one
leave
the
place
with
me
paredes
smiled
a
little
shaking
his
head
you
behaved
as
if
graham
earlier
fears
had
been
accomplished
you
insisted
you
were
going
to
catch
your
train
i
did
think
it
wise
so
i
went
to
the
cloak
room
with
you
intending
to
see
you
home
somehow
just
the
same
you
gave
me
the
slip
you
ought
to
have
let
him
get
away
graham
said
paredes
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
were
there
you
do
know
how
sly
bobby
was
i
suppose
it
useless
to
ask
graham
said
you
saw
nothing
put
in
his
wine
paredes
laughed
is
it
likely
certainly
not
i
should
have
mentioned
it
i
should
have
stopped
such
a
thing
what
do
you
think
i
am
mr
graham
sorry
graham
said
you
must
understand
we
ca
let
any
lead
slip
this
stranger
maria
brought
up
i
did
catch
his
name
paredes
answered
i
never
seen
him
before
i
gathered
he
was
a
friend
of
hers
connected
with
the
profession
now
i
shall
telephone
with
your
permission
miss
katherine
and
do
you
worry
bobby
i
will
see
you
through
but
we
ca
do
much
until
the
coroner
comes
until
the
detective
can
be
made
to
talk
katherine
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
she
surrendered
please
go
with
him
hartley
and
and
make
him
as
comfortable
as
you
can
in
this
unhappy
house
katherine
detained
bobby
with
a
nod
he
saw
the
others
go
he
shrank
in
his
mental
and
physical
discomfort
from
this
isolation
with
her
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
she
touched
his
hand
she
burst
out
passionately
i
do
believe
it
bobby
i
never
believe
it
no
matter
what
happens
it
sweet
of
you
katherine
he
said
huskily
that
helps
when
you
do
know
what
to
believe
yourself
do
talk
that
way
such
a
crime
would
never
have
entered
your
head
under
any
conditions
only
bobby
it
ought
never
to
have
happened
you
ought
never
to
have
been
in
this
position
why
have
you
been
friendly
with
people
like
like
that
spaniard
what
can
he
want
forcing
himself
here
at
any
rate
you
never
lead
that
sort
of
life
again
her
fingers
sought
his
he
clasped
them
firmly
if
i
get
past
this
he
said
i
always
look
you
straight
in
the
eye
katherine
it
was
mad
silly
you
do
quite
understand
he
broke
off
glancing
at
the
door
through
which
graham
had
disappeared
then
remember
she
said
softly
i
do
believe
it
she
released
his
hand
sighing
that
all
i
can
say
all
i
can
do
now
you
ill
bobby
go
in
rest
for
awhile
when
you
had
sleep
you
may
remember
something
he
shook
his
head
he
walked
slowly
with
her
to
the
house
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
he
heard
paredes
telephoning
he
understand
the
man
insistence
on
remaining
where
clearly
he
was
an
intruder
he
entered
his
bedroom
which
he
had
occupied
only
once
or
twice
during
the
last
few
months
the
place
seemed
unfamiliar
as
he
bathed
and
dressed
his
sense
of
strangeness
grew
and
he
understood
why
the
last
time
he
had
been
here
he
had
stood
in
no
personal
danger
there
had
been
no
black
parenthesis
in
his
life
during
the
stretch
of
which
he
might
have
committed
an
unspeakable
crime
for
he
could
believe
as
firmly
as
katherine
did
since
he
could
remember
he
might
have
done
anything
come
he
called
in
response
to
a
stealthy
rapping
at
the
door
stealth
it
occurred
to
him
had
since
last
night
become
a
stern
condition
of
his
life
graham
entered
and
noiselessly
closed
the
door
i
had
a
chance
to
slip
in
he
explained
paredes
is
wandering
about
the
place
i
give
a
lot
to
know
what
he
after
at
the
cedars
katherine
is
in
her
room
trying
to
rest
after
last
night
i
fancy
and
bobby
asked
the
detective
howells
if
he
back
from
the
station
graham
answered
he
keeping
low
i
wonder
if
it
was
he
or
paredes
who
followed
you
through
the
woods
why
should
carlos
have
followed
me
bobby
asked
i
been
thinking
it
over
hartley
it
is
a
bad
scheme
having
him
here
since
you
think
he
has
told
all
he
knows
i
do
say
that
graham
answered
i
do
know
what
to
think
about
paredes
i
come
to
talk
about
just
that
i
a
lawyer
and
i
had
some
criminal
practice
since
this
detective
will
be
satisfied
with
you
for
a
victim
i
going
to
take
your
case
if
you
have
me
i
be
your
detective
as
well
as
your
lawyer
bobby
was
a
good
deal
touched
that
kind
of
you
more
than
i
deserve
for
i
have
resented
you
at
times
graham
it
was
clear
did
guess
he
referred
to
his
friendship
for
katherine
for
he
answered
quickly
i
must
have
seemed
a
nuisance
but
i
was
only
trying
to
get
you
back
on
the
straight
path
where
you
always
belonged
i
ca
believe
you
did
this
thing
even
unconsciously
until
i
shown
proof
without
a
single
flaw
until
the
autopsy
the
only
thing
we
have
to
work
on
is
that
party
last
night
i
telephoned
to
new
york
and
put
a
trustworthy
man
on
the
heels
of
maria
and
the
stranger
meantime
i
think
i
better
watch
developments
here
please
bobby
agreed
stay
with
me
hartley
until
this
man
takes
some
definite
action
he
picked
at
the
fringe
of
the
window
curtain
if
the
autopsy
shows
that
my
grandfather
was
murdered
he
said
either
i
killed
him
or
else
some
one
has
deliberately
tried
to
throw
suspicion
on
me
for
with
only
a
motive
to
go
on
this
detective
would
be
so
sure
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
should
any
one
kill
the
old
man
place
all
this
money
in
my
hands
and
at
the
same
time
send
me
to
the
electric
chair
do
you
see
how
absurd
it
is
that
carlos
maria
or
any
one
else
should
have
had
a
hand
in
it
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
gain
from
his
death
i
thought
and
thought
in
such
circles
until
i
am
almost
convinced
of
the
logic
of
my
guilt
he
drew
the
curtain
farther
back
and
gazed
across
the
court
at
the
room
where
his
grandfather
lay
dead
one
of
the
two
windows
of
the
room
was
a
little
raised
but
the
blinds
were
closely
drawn
i
did
hate
him
he
mused
there
that
ever
since
i
can
remember
he
did
things
to
make
me
despise
him
have
have
you
seen
him
graham
nodded
howells
took
me
in
he
looked
perfectly
normal
not
a
mark
i
do
want
to
see
him
bobby
said
he
drew
back
from
the
window
pointing
the
detective
howells
had
strolled
into
the
court
his
hands
hung
at
his
sides
they
did
swing
as
he
walked
his
lips
were
stretched
in
that
thin
straight
smile
he
paused
by
the
fountain
glancing
for
a
moment
anxiously
downward
then
he
came
on
and
entered
the
house
he
be
restless
graham
said
until
the
coroner
comes
and
proves
or
disproves
his
theory
of
murder
if
he
questions
you
you
better
say
nothing
for
the
present
from
his
point
of
view
what
you
remember
of
last
night
would
be
only
damaging
i
want
him
to
leave
me
alone
bobby
said
if
he
does
arrest
me
i
wo
have
him
bullying
me
jenkins
knocked
and
entered
the
old
butler
was
as
as
bobby
more
tremulous
the
policeman
sir
he
asking
for
you
tell
him
i
do
wish
to
see
him
the
detective
himself
stepped
from
the
obscurity
of
the
hall
smiling
his
queer
smile
ah
you
are
here
blackburn
i
like
a
word
with
you
he
turned
to
graham
and
jenkins
alone
if
you
please
bobby
mutely
agreed
and
graham
and
the
butler
went
out
the
detective
closed
the
door
and
leaned
against
it
studying
bobby
with
his
narrow
eyes
i
do
suppose
he
began
that
there
any
use
asking
you
about
your
movements
last
night
none
bobby
answered
jerkily
unless
you
arrest
me
and
take
me
before
those
who
ask
questions
with
authority
the
detective
smile
widened
no
matter
i
did
come
to
argue
with
you
about
that
i
was
curious
to
know
if
you
tried
to
see
your
grandfather
body
bobby
shook
his
head
i
took
it
for
granted
the
room
was
locked
yes
the
detective
answered
but
some
people
it
seems
have
skilful
ways
of
overcoming
locks
he
moved
to
one
side
placing
his
hand
on
the
door
knob
i
come
to
open
doors
for
you
to
give
you
the
opportunity
an
affectionate
grandson
must
crave
bobby
hesitated
fighting
back
his
feeling
of
repulsion
his
first
instinct
to
refuse
the
detective
might
take
it
as
an
evidence
against
him
on
the
other
hand
if
he
went
the
man
would
unquestionably
try
to
tear
from
a
meeting
between
the
living
and
the
dead
some
valuable
confirmation
of
his
theory
well
the
detective
said
what
the
matter
thought
the
least
i
could
do
was
to
give
you
a
chance
would
do
it
for
everybody
then
everybody
has
your
affectionate
nature
bobby
advanced
for
god
sake
stop
mocking
me
i
go
since
you
wish
the
detective
opened
the
door
and
stood
aside
to
let
bobby
pass
daresay
you
know
the
room
the
way
to
it
bobby
did
answer
he
went
along
the
corridor
and
into
the
main
hall
where
katherine
had
met
silas
blackburn
last
night
he
fought
back
his
aversion
and
entered
the
corridor
of
the
old
wing
he
heard
the
detective
behind
him
he
was
aware
of
the
man
narrow
eyes
watching
him
with
a
malicious
assurance
bobby
with
a
feeling
of
discomfort
sprung
in
part
from
the
gloomy
passageway
paused
before
the
door
his
grandfather
had
had
the
unaccountable
whim
of
entering
last
night
the
detective
took
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
inserted
it
in
the
lock
had
some
trouble
repairing
the
lock
this
morning
he
said
that
fellow
jenkins
entered
with
a
heavy
hand
a
good
deal
heavier
than
whoever
was
here
before
him
he
opened
the
door
queerest
case
i
ever
seen
he
mumbled
step
in
mr
blackburn
because
of
the
drawn
blinds
the
room
was
nearly
as
dark
as
the
corridor
bobby
entered
slowly
his
nerves
taut
against
the
farther
wall
the
bed
was
like
an
enormous
shadow
without
form
stay
where
you
are
the
detective
warned
until
i
give
you
more
light
you
know
i
would
want
you
to
touch
anything
because
the
room
is
exactly
as
it
was
when
he
was
murdered
bobby
experienced
a
swift
impulse
to
strangle
the
brutal
word
in
the
detective
throat
but
he
stood
still
while
the
man
went
to
the
bureau
struck
a
match
and
applied
it
to
a
candle
the
wick
burned
reluctantly
it
flickered
in
the
wind
that
slipped
past
the
curtain
of
the
open
window
come
here
the
detective
commanded
roughly
bobby
dragged
himself
forward
until
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
detective
lifted
the
candle
and
held
it
beneath
the
canopy
you
look
all
you
want
now
robert
blackburn
he
said
grimly
bobby
conquered
the
desire
to
close
his
eyes
to
refuse
to
obey
he
stared
at
his
grandfather
and
a
feeling
of
wonder
grew
upon
him
for
silas
blackburn
rested
peacefully
in
the
great
bed
his
eyes
were
closed
the
thick
gray
brows
were
no
longer
gathered
in
the
frown
too
familiar
to
bobby
the
face
with
its
gray
beard
retained
no
fear
no
record
of
a
great
shock
bobby
glanced
at
the
detective
who
bent
over
the
bed
watching
him
out
of
his
narrow
eyes
why
he
asked
simply
do
you
say
he
was
murdered
he
was
murdered
the
detective
answered
murdered
in
cold
blood
and
look
you
here
young
fellow
i
know
who
did
it
i
going
to
strap
that
man
in
the
electric
chair
he
got
just
one
chance
if
he
talks
out
if
he
makes
a
clean
breast
of
it
across
the
body
he
bent
closer
he
held
the
candle
so
that
its
light
searched
bobby
face
instead
of
the
dead
man
and
the
uncertain
flame
was
like
an
ambush
for
his
eyes
in
response
to
those
intolerable
words
bobby
sick
nerves
stretched
too
tight
no
masquerade
remained
before
this
huntsman
who
had
his
victim
trapped
and
calmly
studied
his
agony
the
horror
of
the
accusation
shot
at
him
across
the
body
of
the
man
he
could
be
sure
he
had
murdered
robbed
him
of
his
last
control
he
cried
out
hysterically
why
do
you
do
something
for
god
sake
why
do
you
arrest
me
a
chuckle
came
from
the
man
in
ambush
behind
the
yellow
flame
listen
to
the
boy
what
he
talking
about
grief
for
his
grandfather
that
what
it
is
grief
stop
bobby
shouted
it
what
you
been
accusing
me
with
ever
since
you
stopped
me
at
the
station
he
indicated
the
silent
form
of
the
old
man
you
keep
telling
me
i
murdered
him
why
do
you
arrest
me
then
why
do
you
lock
me
up
why
do
you
put
the
case
on
a
reasonable
basis
he
waited
trembling
the
flame
continued
to
flicker
but
the
hand
holding
the
candlestick
failed
to
move
and
bobby
knew
that
the
eyes
did
waver
either
he
forced
his
glance
from
the
searching
flame
he
managed
to
lower
and
steady
his
voice
you
ca
that
the
trouble
he
was
murdered
the
coroner
will
tell
you
so
anybody
who
looks
at
him
will
tell
you
so
since
you
have
the
nerve
to
arrest
me
i
going
i
glad
to
have
had
this
out
with
you
understand
i
my
own
master
i
do
what
i
please
i
go
where
i
please
at
last
the
candle
moved
to
one
side
the
detective
straightened
and
walked
to
bobby
the
multitude
of
small
lines
in
his
face
twitched
his
voice
was
too
cold
for
the
fury
of
his
words
that
just
what
i
want
you
to
do
damn
you
anything
you
please
accusing
nobody
but
i
getting
somebody
i
got
somebody
right
now
for
this
old
man
murder
my
man
going
to
writhe
and
burn
in
the
chair
confession
or
no
confession
now
get
out
of
this
room
since
so
anxious
and
do
come
near
it
again
bobby
went
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
he
heard
the
closing
of
the
door
the
scraping
of
the
key
he
was
afraid
the
detective
might
follow
him
to
his
room
to
heckle
him
further
to
avoid
that
he
hurried
to
the
lower
floor
he
wanted
to
be
alone
he
must
have
time
to
accustom
himself
to
this
degrading
fate
which
loomed
in
the
future
unless
they
could
demolish
the
detective
theory
he
bobby
blackburn
would
go
to
the
death
house
a
fire
blazed
in
the
big
hall
fireplace
paredes
stood
with
his
back
to
it
smoking
and
warming
his
hands
a
man
sat
in
the
shadow
of
a
deep
leather
chair
his
rough
unpolished
boots
stretched
toward
the
flaming
logs
as
he
came
down
the
stairs
bobby
heard
the
heavy
rumbling
voice
of
the
man
in
the
chair
certainly
it
a
queer
case
but
not
the
way
howells
means
i
daresay
the
old
fool
died
what
the
world
will
call
a
natural
death
if
you
smoke
so
much
you
will
too
before
long
bobby
tried
to
slip
past
but
paredes
saw
him
feeling
better
bobby
the
boots
were
drawn
in
from
the
depths
of
the
chair
arose
a
figure
nearly
gigantic
in
the
firelight
the
man
face
at
first
glance
appeared
to
be
covered
with
hair
black
and
curling
it
straggled
over
his
forehead
it
circled
his
mouth
and
fell
in
an
unkempt
beard
down
his
waistcoat
the
huge
man
must
have
been
as
old
as
silas
blackburn
but
he
showed
no
touch
of
gray
his
only
concession
to
age
was
the
sunken
and
bloodshot
appearance
of
his
eyes
bobby
and
katherine
had
always
been
afraid
of
this
great
grim
country
practitioner
who
had
attended
their
childish
illnesses
that
sense
of
an
overpowering
and
incomprehensible
personality
had
lingered
even
through
his
graver
fear
bobby
felt
a
sharp
discomfort
as
he
surrendered
his
hand
to
the
other
absorbing
grasp
i
afraid
you
came
too
late
this
time
doctor
groom
the
doctor
looked
him
up
and
down
not
for
you
i
guess
he
grumbled
do
you
know
you
sick
boy
bobby
shook
his
head
i
very
tired
that
all
i
on
my
way
to
the
library
to
try
to
rest
he
freed
his
hand
the
big
man
nodded
approvingly
i
send
you
a
dose
he
promised
and
do
you
worry
about
your
grandfather
having
been
murdered
by
any
man
i
seen
the
body
stuff
and
nonsense
detective
an
ass
waiting
for
coroner
although
i
know
he
one
too
i
pray
bobby
answered
listlessly
that
you
right
if
there
any
little
thing
i
can
do
paredes
offered
formally
no
no
thanks
bobby
answered
he
went
on
to
the
library
he
glanced
with
an
unpleasant
shrinking
from
the
door
of
the
enclosed
staircase
leading
to
the
private
hall
just
outside
the
room
in
which
his
grandfather
lay
dead
there
was
no
fire
here
but
he
wrapped
himself
in
a
rug
and
lay
on
the
broad
lounge
which
was
drawn
close
to
the
fireplace
facing
it
his
complete
weariness
conquered
his
premonitions
his
feeling
of
helplessness
the
entrance
of
jenkins
barely
aroused
him
where
are
you
mr
robert
here
bobby
answered
sleepily
the
butler
walked
to
the
lounge
and
looked
over
the
back
to
be
sure
sir
i
did
see
you
here
he
held
out
a
glass
doctor
groom
said
you
were
to
drink
this
it
would
make
you
sleep
sir
bobby
closed
his
eyes
again
put
it
on
the
table
where
i
can
reach
it
when
i
want
it
yes
sir
robert
the
policeman
did
he
say
anything
if
i
might
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
go
away
bobby
groaned
leave
me
in
peace
and
peace
for
a
little
time
came
to
him
it
was
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
room
that
aroused
him
he
lay
for
a
time
scarcely
knowing
where
he
was
but
little
by
little
the
sickening
truth
came
back
and
he
realized
that
it
was
graham
and
the
detective
howells
who
talked
close
to
the
window
and
graham
had
already
fulfilled
his
promise
bobby
did
want
to
eavesdrop
but
it
was
patent
he
would
embarrass
graham
by
disclosing
himself
now
and
it
was
likely
graham
would
be
glad
of
a
witness
to
anything
the
detective
might
say
it
was
still
light
a
ray
from
the
low
sun
entered
the
window
and
rested
on
the
door
of
the
enclosed
staircase
graham
anxious
demand
was
the
first
thing
bobby
heard
distinctly
the
thing
that
warned
him
to
remain
secreted
i
think
now
with
the
coroner
on
his
way
it
time
you
defined
your
suspicions
a
trifle
more
clearly
i
am
a
lawyer
in
a
sense
i
represent
young
blackburn
please
tell
me
why
you
are
so
sure
his
grandfather
was
murdered
all
right
the
detective
level
voice
came
back
half
an
hour
ago
i
would
have
said
no
again
but
now
i
got
the
evidence
i
wanted
i
appreciate
graham
that
you
a
friend
of
that
young
rascal
and
what
i
have
to
say
is
pleasant
for
a
friend
to
hear
but
first
you
want
to
know
why
i
so
sure
the
case
is
murder
in
spite
of
the
doctor
who
made
his
diagnosis
without
really
looking
go
on
graham
said
softly
bobby
waited
his
nerves
as
tense
as
they
had
grown
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
man
two
days
ago
the
detective
went
on
quietly
old
blackburn
came
to
the
court
house
in
smithtown
and
asked
for
the
best
detective
the
district
attorney
could
put
his
hand
on
i
do
want
to
blow
my
own
trumpet
but
i
got
away
with
one
or
two
pretty
fair
jobs
i
had
good
offers
from
private
firms
in
new
york
so
they
turned
him
over
to
me
it
was
easy
to
see
the
old
man
was
scared
just
as
his
niece
says
he
was
last
night
the
funny
part
was
he
would
say
definitely
what
he
was
afraid
of
i
thought
he
might
be
shielding
somebody
until
he
was
a
little
surer
of
his
ground
he
told
me
he
was
afraid
of
being
murdered
and
he
wanted
a
good
man
he
could
call
on
to
come
out
here
to
the
cedars
if
things
got
too
hot
for
him
i
can
hear
his
voice
now
as
distinctly
as
if
he
was
standing
where
you
are
heart
all
right
he
said
wo
stop
awhile
yet
unless
made
to
so
if
i
found
cold
some
fine
morning
you
can
be
sure
i
was
put
out
of
the
way
i
tried
to
pump
him
naturally
but
he
would
say
another
word
except
that
he
send
for
me
if
there
was
time
he
did
want
any
fuss
made
and
he
gave
me
a
handsome
present
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
and
not
to
bother
him
with
any
more
questions
i
figured
you
ca
blame
me
graham
that
the
old
boy
was
a
little
cracked
so
i
took
his
money
and
let
it
go
at
that
i
did
think
much
more
about
it
until
they
told
me
early
this
morning
he
lay
dead
here
under
peculiar
circumstances
odd
graham
commented
it
does
make
it
more
like
murder
howells
but
he
does
look
like
a
murdered
man
when
you
know
as
much
about
crime
as
i
do
graham
you
realize
that
murders
which
are
a
long
time
planning
are
likely
to
take
on
one
of
two
appearances
suicide
or
natural
death
all
right
graham
said
for
the
purpose
of
argument
let
us
agree
murder
even
so
why
do
you
suspect
young
blackburn
without
a
scrap
of
evidence
it
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
the
detective
answered
if
old
blackburn
had
lived
until
this
morning
our
young
man
would
have
been
a
pauper
as
it
is
he
a
millionaire
but
i
do
think
he
enjoy
his
money
the
two
had
been
at
sword
points
for
a
long
time
robert
hated
the
old
man
never
made
any
bones
about
it
you
could
ask
for
a
more
damaging
motive
you
ca
convict
a
man
on
motive
graham
said
shortly
you
spoke
of
evidence
more
the
detective
replied
than
any
jury
in
the
land
would
ask
bobby
held
his
breath
shrinking
from
this
information
which
however
he
realized
it
was
better
he
should
know
when
i
got
here
the
detective
said
i
decided
on
the
theory
of
murder
to
make
a
careful
search
as
soon
as
day
broke
i
did
have
to
wait
for
day
though
to
find
one
crying
piece
of
evidence
for
a
long
time
i
was
alone
in
the
room
with
the
body
queer
feeling
about
that
room
graham
do
know
how
to
describe
it
except
to
say
it
uncomfortable
too
old
maybe
maybe
it
was
just
being
there
alone
with
the
dead
man
before
the
dawn
although
i
thought
i
was
hardened
to
that
sort
of
thing
anyway
i
did
like
it
to
keep
my
spirits
up
as
well
as
to
save
time
i
commenced
searching
the
place
with
a
candle
nothing
about
the
bed
nothing
in
the
closets
or
the
bureau
he
grinned
sheepishly
you
know
i
kind
of
was
afraid
to
open
the
closet
doors
then
i
got
on
my
knees
and
looked
under
the
bed
the
light
was
bad
and
i
did
see
anything
at
first
after
a
minute
close
against
the
wall
i
noticed
something
white
i
reached
in
and
pulled
it
out
it
was
a
handkerchief
and
it
had
a
monogram
graham
in
purple
and
green
he
paused
graham
exclaimed
sharply
bobby
felt
the
net
tighten
if
that
evidence
was
conclusive
to
the
others
how
much
more
so
was
it
for
him
he
recalled
how
after
awaking
in
the
empty
house
he
had
searched
unsuccessfully
in
all
his
pockets
for
his
handkerchief
intending
to
brush
the
dirt
from
his
shoes
i
went
to
his
room
the
detective
hurried
on
and
found
a
lot
of
his
clothes
and
his
stationery
and
his
toilet
articles
marked
with
the
same
cipher
i
knew
my
man
had
made
a
big
mistake
the
sort
of
mistake
every
criminal
makes
no
matter
how
clever
he
is
and
i
had
him
but
that
is
by
any
means
all
do
look
so
distressed
graham
there
is
the
slightest
chance
for
him
you
see
i
repaired
the
lock
and
as
soon
as
it
was
day
closed
the
room
and
went
outside
to
look
for
signs
since
nightfall
no
one
had
come
legitimately
through
the
court
except
doctor
groom
and
myself
our
footprints
were
all
right
making
a
straight
line
along
the
path
to
the
front
door
in
the
soft
earth
by
the
fountain
i
found
another
and
a
smaller
print
made
by
a
very
neat
shoe
sir
and
i
said
to
myself
is
almost
certainly
the
footprint
of
the
murderer
there
were
plenty
of
others
coming
across
the
grass
he
evidently
avoided
the
path
and
there
was
one
directly
under
the
open
window
where
the
body
lies
it
still
there
perhaps
you
can
see
it
no
matter
that
the
last
one
i
found
the
prints
ceased
there
there
was
a
one
going
back
and
i
was
fair
up
a
stump
then
i
saw
a
little
undefined
sign
of
pressure
on
the
grass
and
i
got
an
idea
i
says
man
took
his
shoes
off
and
went
around
in
his
stockinged
feet
i
could
understand
though
why
he
had
thought
of
that
before
i
went
back
to
robert
blackburn
room
and
got
one
of
his
shoes
and
ran
into
a
snag
again
the
sole
of
the
shoe
was
a
trifle
larger
than
the
footprints
every
one
of
his
shoes
i
tried
was
the
same
way
i
argued
that
the
handkerchief
was
enough
but
i
wanted
this
other
evidence
i
simply
had
to
clear
up
these
queer
footprints
i
figured
since
the
murder
had
been
made
to
look
so
much
like
a
natural
death
that
he
come
out
here
some
time
expecting
to
carry
it
off
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
station
anyway
to
find
out
if
he
been
seen
coming
through
last
night
or
early
this
morning
while
i
was
talking
to
the
station
agent
i
had
my
one
piece
of
luck
i
could
believe
my
eyes
robert
walks
up
from
the
woods
he
been
hiding
around
the
neighbourhood
all
the
time
probably
had
missed
his
handkerchief
and
decided
he
better
not
take
any
chances
yet
it
must
have
seemed
a
pretty
sure
thing
that
the
station
would
be
watched
and
it
those
nervy
things
doing
the
obvious
that
skilful
criminals
get
away
with
all
the
time
i
needed
only
one
look
at
him
and
i
had
the
answer
to
the
mystery
of
the
footprints
i
gave
him
plenty
of
time
to
come
here
and
change
his
clothes
then
i
manoeuvered
him
out
of
his
room
and
went
there
and
found
the
pumps
he
worn
last
night
and
you
see
they
be
a
little
smaller
than
his
ordinary
shoes
not
only
did
they
fit
the
footprints
exactly
but
they
were
stained
with
soil
exactly
like
that
in
the
court
there
you
are
sir
i
made
a
plaster
cast
of
one
of
the
prints
i
got
it
here
in
my
pocket
where
i
intend
to
keep
it
until
i
clear
the
whole
case
up
and
turn
in
my
report
graham
tone
was
shocked
and
discouraged
what
more
do
you
want
why
have
you
arrested
him
in
this
room
the
detective
satisfied
chuckle
was
an
offence
no
good
detective
would
ask
that
graham
i
want
my
report
clean
the
coroner
will
tell
us
how
the
old
man
was
killed
i
want
to
tell
how
young
blackburn
got
into
that
room
one
of
the
windows
was
raised
a
trifle
but
that
no
use
i
figured
on
the
outside
of
the
wing
until
i
dizzy
there
no
way
up
for
a
normal
man
an
orangoutang
would
make
hard
work
of
it
his
latch
key
would
have
let
him
into
the
house
and
it
would
have
been
simple
enough
for
him
to
find
out
that
the
old
man
had
changed
his
room
i
got
to
find
out
how
he
got
past
those
doors
locked
on
the
inside
he
chuckled
again
almost
like
a
work
bobby
shivered
was
that
where
the
evidence
pointed
already
the
net
was
too
finely
woven
the
detective
continued
earnestly
i
figuring
on
some
scheme
to
make
him
show
me
the
way
i
a
sort
of
plan
for
but
it
only
a
chance
what
graham
asked
oh
no
sir
howells
laughed
you
learn
about
that
when
the
time
comes
i
do
understand
you
graham
said
you
sure
of
your
man
but
you
keep
no
close
watch
on
him
do
you
know
where
he
is
now
have
the
slightest
idea
mr
graham
what
to
prevent
his
running
away
i
offering
him
every
opportunity
he
would
get
far
and
i
a
feeling
that
if
he
confessed
by
running
he
break
down
and
give
up
the
whole
thing
you
no
idea
how
it
frets
me
graham
i
got
my
man
practically
in
the
chair
but
from
a
professional
point
of
view
it
a
pretty
piece
of
work
until
i
find
out
how
he
got
in
and
out
of
that
room
the
thing
seems
impossible
and
yet
here
we
are
knowing
that
he
did
it
well
maybe
i
find
out
hello
the
door
opened
bobby
from
his
hiding
place
could
see
paredes
on
the
threshold
yawning
and
holding
a
cigarette
in
his
fingers
here
you
are
he
said
drowsily
i
just
been
in
the
court
it
made
me
seek
company
that
court
too
damp
mr
detective
his
laugh
was
lackadaisical
when
the
sun
leaves
it
the
court
seems
full
of
unfriendly
things
what
the
ignorant
would
call
ghosts
i
spanish
and
i
know
the
detective
grunted
funny
paredes
went
on
observation
does
seem
to
interest
you
rather
fancied
it
might
he
yawned
again
and
put
his
cigarette
to
his
lips
puffing
placidly
he
turned
and
left
what
do
you
suppose
he
means
by
that
the
detective
said
to
graham
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
followed
paredes
from
the
room
graham
went
after
him
bobby
threw
back
the
rug
and
arose
for
a
moment
he
was
as
curious
as
the
others
as
to
paredes
intention
he
slipped
across
the
dining
room
the
hall
was
deserted
the
front
door
stood
open
from
the
court
came
paredes
voice
even
languid
wholly
without
expression
mean
to
tell
me
you
do
react
to
the
proximity
of
unaccountable
forces
here
mr
howells
the
detective
laugh
was
disagreeable
you
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
me
that
is
healthy
as
bobby
hurried
across
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
he
heard
paredes
answer
you
should
speak
to
doctor
groom
he
says
this
place
is
too
crowded
by
the
unpleasant
past
bobby
climbed
out
of
hearing
he
entered
his
bedroom
and
locked
the
door
he
resented
paredes
words
and
attitude
which
he
defined
as
studied
to
draw
humour
out
of
a
tragic
and
desperate
situation
he
thought
of
them
in
no
other
way
his
tired
mind
dismissed
them
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
muttering
if
i
run
away
i
done
for
if
i
stay
i
done
for
he
took
a
fierce
twisted
joy
in
one
phase
of
the
situation
if
i
was
there
last
night
he
thought
howells
will
never
find
out
how
i
got
into
the
room
because
no
matter
what
trap
he
sets
i
tell
him
his
leaden
weariness
closed
his
eyes
for
a
few
minutes
he
slept
again
once
more
it
was
a
voice
that
awakened
him
this
time
a
woman
raised
in
a
scream
he
sprang
up
flung
open
the
door
and
stumbled
into
the
corridor
katherine
stood
there
holding
her
dressing
gown
about
her
with
trembling
hands
the
face
she
turned
to
bobby
was
white
and
she
beckoned
and
he
followed
her
to
the
main
hall
the
others
came
tearing
up
the
stairs
graham
paredes
the
detective
and
the
black
and
gigantic
doctor
in
answer
to
their
quick
questions
she
whispered
breathlessly
i
heard
it
was
just
like
last
night
it
came
across
the
court
and
stole
in
at
my
window
she
shook
she
stretched
out
her
hands
in
a
terrified
appeal
somebody
something
moved
in
that
room
where
he
he
dead
nonsense
the
detective
said
both
doors
are
locked
and
i
have
the
keys
in
my
pocket
paredes
fumbled
with
a
cigarette
you
forgetting
what
i
said
about
my
sensitive
apprehension
of
strange
things
the
detective
interrupted
him
loudly
confidently
i
tell
you
the
room
is
empty
except
for
the
murdered
man
unless
someone
broken
down
a
door
katherine
cried
out
no
i
heard
that
same
stirring
something
moved
in
there
the
detective
turned
brusquely
and
entered
the
old
corridor
we
see
the
others
followed
katherine
was
close
to
bobby
he
touched
her
hand
he
right
katherine
no
one
there
no
one
could
have
been
there
you
must
give
way
like
this
i
depending
on
you
on
your
faith
she
pressed
his
hand
but
her
assurance
did
diminish
the
key
scraped
in
the
lock
they
crowded
through
the
doorway
after
the
detective
he
struck
a
match
and
lighted
the
candle
he
held
it
over
the
bed
he
sprang
back
with
a
sharp
cry
unlike
his
level
quality
his
confident
conceit
he
pointed
they
all
approximated
his
helpless
gesture
his
blank
amazement
for
on
the
bed
had
occurred
an
abominable
change
the
body
of
silas
blackburn
no
longer
lay
peacefully
on
its
back
it
had
been
turned
on
its
side
and
remained
in
a
stark
and
awkward
attitude
for
the
first
time
the
back
of
the
head
was
disclosed
their
glances
focussed
there
on
the
tiny
round
hole
at
the
base
of
the
brain
on
the
pillow
where
the
head
had
rested
and
which
they
saw
now
was
stained
with
an
ugly
and
irregular
splotch
of
blood
bobby
saw
the
candle
quiver
at
last
in
the
detective
hand
the
man
strode
to
the
door
leading
to
the
private
hall
and
examined
the
lock
both
doors
he
said
were
locked
there
was
no
way
in
he
turned
to
the
others
spreading
his
hands
in
justification
the
candle
which
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
cast
gross
moving
shadows
over
his
face
and
over
the
face
of
the
dead
man
at
least
you
all
grant
me
now
that
he
was
murdered
they
continued
to
stare
at
the
body
of
silas
blackburn
cold
for
many
hours
it
was
as
if
he
had
made
this
atrocious
revealing
movement
to
assure
them
that
he
had
indeed
been
murdered
to
expose
to
their
startled
eyes
the
sly
and
deadly
method
chapter
iii
howells
delivers
himself
to
the
abandoned
room
for
a
long
time
no
one
spoke
the
body
of
silas
blackburn
had
been
alone
in
a
locked
room
yet
before
their
eyes
it
lay
turned
on
its
side
as
if
to
inform
them
of
the
fashion
of
this
murder
the
tiny
hole
at
the
base
of
the
brain
the
on
the
pillow
which
the
head
had
concealed
offered
their
mute
and
ghastly
testimony
doctor
groom
was
the
first
to
relax
he
raised
his
great
hairy
hand
to
the
and
grasped
it
his
rumbling
voice
lacked
its
usual
authority
it
vibrated
with
a
childish
wonder
i
reminded
that
it
is
the
first
time
there
been
blood
from
a
man
head
on
that
pillow
katherine
nodded
what
do
you
mean
the
detective
snarled
there
only
one
answer
to
this
there
must
have
been
a
mechanical
reaction
for
a
moment
doctor
groom
laugh
filled
the
old
room
it
ceased
abruptly
he
shook
his
head
do
be
a
fool
policeman
at
the
most
conservative
estimate
this
man
has
been
dead
more
than
thirteen
hours
even
a
few
instants
after
death
the
human
body
is
incapable
of
any
such
reaction
what
then
the
detective
asked
some
one
of
us
or
one
of
the
servants
must
have
overcome
the
locks
again
and
deliberately
disturbed
the
body
that
must
be
so
but
i
do
get
the
motive
it
is
so
doctor
groom
answered
bluntly
already
the
detective
had
to
a
large
extent
controlled
his
bewilderment
i
like
your
theory
then
he
said
dryly
you
and
paredes
have
both
been
gossiping
about
the
supernatural
when
you
first
came
you
hinted
dark
things
you
said
he
probably
died
what
the
world
would
call
a
natural
death
i
meant
the
doctor
answered
only
that
blackburn
heart
might
have
failed
under
the
impulse
of
a
sudden
fright
in
this
room
i
also
said
you
remember
that
the
room
was
nasty
and
unhealthy
plenty
of
people
have
remarked
it
before
me
graham
touched
the
detective
arm
a
little
while
ago
you
admitted
yourself
that
the
room
was
uncomfortable
doctor
groom
smiled
the
detective
faced
him
with
a
fierce
belligerency
you
agree
he
was
murdered
certainly
if
you
wish
to
call
it
that
but
i
ask
for
the
sharp
instrument
that
caused
death
i
want
to
know
how
while
blackburn
lay
on
his
back
it
was
inserted
through
the
bed
the
springs
the
mattress
and
the
pillow
what
are
you
driving
at
doctor
groom
pointed
to
the
dead
man
i
merely
repeat
that
it
is
the
first
time
that
pillow
been
stained
from
unusual
wounds
in
the
head
being
as
you
call
it
a
trifle
superstitious
i
merely
ask
if
the
coincidence
is
significant
katherine
cried
out
bobby
in
spite
of
his
knowledge
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
be
arrested
for
his
grandfather
murder
stepped
forward
nodding
i
know
what
you
mean
doctor
anybody
the
doctor
said
who
ever
heard
of
this
house
knows
what
i
mean
we
need
talk
of
that
the
detective
however
was
insistent
paredes
in
his
unemotional
way
expressed
an
equal
curiosity
bobby
and
katherine
had
been
frightened
as
children
by
the
stories
clustering
about
the
old
wing
they
nodded
from
time
to
time
while
the
doctor
held
them
in
the
desolate
room
with
the
dead
man
speaking
of
the
other
deaths
it
had
sheltered
silas
blackburn
great
grandfather
he
told
the
detective
had
been
carried
to
that
bed
from
a
revolutionary
skirmish
with
a
bullet
at
the
base
of
his
brain
for
many
hours
he
had
raved
deliriously
fighting
unsuccessfully
against
the
final
silence
it
has
been
a
legend
in
the
family
as
these
young
people
will
tell
you
that
blackburns
die
hard
and
there
are
those
who
believe
that
people
who
die
hard
leave
something
behind
them
something
that
clings
to
the
physical
surroundings
of
their
suffering
if
it
was
only
that
one
case
but
it
goes
on
and
on
silas
blackburn
father
for
instance
killed
himself
here
he
had
lost
his
money
in
silly
speculations
he
stood
where
you
stand
detective
and
blew
his
brains
out
he
fell
over
and
lay
where
his
son
lies
his
head
on
that
pillow
silas
blackburn
was
a
money
grubber
he
started
with
nothing
but
this
property
and
he
made
a
fortune
but
even
he
had
enough
imagination
to
lock
this
room
up
after
one
more
death
of
that
kind
it
was
this
girl
father
you
were
too
young
katherine
to
remember
it
but
i
took
care
of
him
i
saw
it
he
was
carried
here
after
he
had
been
struck
at
the
back
of
the
head
in
a
polo
match
he
died
too
fighting
hard
god
how
the
man
suffered
he
loosened
his
bandages
toward
the
end
when
i
got
here
the
pillow
was
redder
than
it
is
it
strikes
me
as
curious
that
the
first
time
the
room
has
been
slept
in
since
then
it
should
harbour
a
death
behind
locked
doors
from
a
wound
in
the
head
paredes
fingers
were
restless
as
if
he
missed
his
customary
cigarette
the
detective
strolled
to
the
window
very
interesting
he
said
extremely
interesting
for
old
women
and
young
children
you
may
classify
yourself
doctor
thanks
the
doctor
rumbled
i
wait
until
you
told
me
how
these
doors
were
entered
how
that
wound
was
made
how
this
body
turned
on
its
side
in
an
empty
room
the
detective
glanced
at
bobby
his
voice
lacked
confidence
i
do
my
best
i
even
try
to
tell
you
why
the
murderer
came
back
this
afternoon
to
disturb
his
victim
bobby
went
curiously
convinced
that
the
doctor
had
had
the
better
of
the
argument
for
a
moment
katherine
graham
paredes
and
he
were
alone
in
the
main
hall
god
knows
what
it
was
graham
said
but
it
may
mean
something
to
you
bobby
tell
us
carefully
katherine
about
the
sounds
that
came
to
you
across
the
court
it
was
just
what
i
heard
last
night
when
he
died
she
answered
it
was
like
something
falling
softly
then
a
sigh
i
tried
to
pay
no
attention
i
fought
it
i
did
call
at
first
but
i
could
keep
quiet
i
knew
we
had
to
go
to
that
room
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
the
detective
or
the
coroner
might
be
there
moving
around
you
were
alone
up
here
graham
said
i
think
so
no
bobby
said
i
was
in
my
room
what
were
you
doing
graham
asked
i
was
asleep
katherine
call
woke
me
up
asleep
paredes
echoed
and
she
did
call
at
once
he
broke
off
bobby
grasped
his
arm
what
are
you
trying
to
do
i
sorry
paredes
said
now
really
you
must
think
of
that
i
should
have
spoken
i
more
inclined
to
agree
with
the
theory
impossible
as
it
seems
yesterday
katherine
said
i
would
have
thought
it
impossible
after
last
night
and
just
now
i
not
so
sure
i
i
wish
the
doctor
were
right
it
would
clear
you
bobby
he
smiled
do
you
think
any
jury
would
listen
to
such
a
theory
katherine
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
howells
and
the
doctor
came
from
the
corridor
of
the
old
wing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
the
detective
turned
you
will
find
it
very
warm
and
comfortable
by
the
fire
in
the
lower
hall
mr
blackburn
he
waited
until
katherine
had
slipped
to
her
room
until
graham
paredes
the
doctor
and
bobby
were
on
the
stairs
then
he
walked
slowly
into
the
new
corridor
bobby
knew
what
he
was
after
the
detective
had
made
no
effort
to
disguise
his
intention
he
wanted
bobby
out
of
the
way
while
he
searched
his
room
again
this
time
for
a
sharp
slender
instrument
capable
of
penetrating
between
the
bones
at
the
base
of
a
man
brain
paredes
lighted
a
cigarette
and
warmed
his
back
at
the
fire
the
doctor
settled
himself
in
his
chair
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
others
he
would
answer
paredes
slow
remarks
interesting
doctor
i
am
a
little
psychic
always
in
this
house
i
have
responded
to
strange
unfriendly
influences
always
as
now
the
approach
of
night
depresses
me
bobby
could
sit
still
he
nodded
at
graham
arose
got
his
coat
and
hat
and
stepped
into
the
court
the
dusk
was
already
thick
there
dampness
and
melancholy
seemed
to
exude
from
the
walls
of
the
old
house
he
paused
and
gazed
at
one
of
the
in
the
soft
earth
by
the
fountain
shreds
of
plaster
adhered
to
the
edges
testimony
that
the
detective
had
made
his
cast
from
this
print
he
tried
to
realize
that
that
mute
familiar
impression
had
the
power
to
send
him
to
his
execution
graham
who
had
come
silently
from
the
house
startled
him
what
are
you
looking
at
no
use
hartley
i
was
on
the
library
lounge
i
heard
every
word
howells
said
perhaps
it
just
as
well
graham
said
you
know
what
you
face
but
i
hate
to
see
you
suffer
we
got
to
find
a
way
around
that
evidence
bobby
pointed
to
the
windows
of
the
room
of
death
there
no
way
around
except
the
doctor
theory
he
laughed
shortly
much
as
i
feared
that
room
i
afraid
the
psychic
explanation
hold
water
paredes
put
his
finger
on
it
i
would
have
had
time
to
get
back
to
my
room
before
katherine
called
stop
bobby
hartley
i
afraid
to
go
to
sleep
it
dreadful
not
to
know
whether
you
are
active
in
your
sleep
whether
you
are
evil
and
ingenious
to
the
point
of
the
miraculous
in
your
sleep
i
so
tired
hartley
why
should
you
have
gone
to
that
room
this
afternoon
graham
asked
you
must
get
this
idea
out
of
your
head
you
must
have
sleep
and
perhaps
when
you
thoroughly
rested
you
will
remember
i
not
so
sure
bobby
said
that
i
want
to
remember
he
pointed
to
the
footprint
there
no
question
i
was
here
last
night
unless
graham
said
your
handkerchief
and
your
shoes
were
stolen
nonsense
bobby
cried
the
only
motive
would
be
to
commit
a
murder
in
order
to
kill
me
by
sending
me
to
the
chair
and
who
would
know
his
way
around
that
dark
house
like
me
who
would
have
found
out
so
easily
that
my
grandfather
had
changed
his
room
it
logical
graham
admitted
slowly
but
we
ca
give
in
by
the
way
has
paredes
ever
borrowed
any
large
sums
bobby
hesitated
after
all
paredes
and
he
had
been
good
friends
a
little
here
and
there
he
answered
reluctantly
has
he
ever
paid
you
back
i
do
recall
bobby
answered
flushing
you
know
i
never
been
exactly
calculating
about
money
whenever
he
wanted
it
i
was
always
glad
to
help
carlos
out
why
do
you
ask
if
any
one
graham
answered
looked
on
you
as
a
certain
source
of
money
there
would
be
a
motive
in
conserving
that
source
in
increasing
it
probably
lots
of
people
knew
blackburn
was
out
of
patience
with
you
would
make
a
new
will
do
you
think
bobby
asked
that
carlos
is
clever
enough
to
have
got
through
those
doors
and
what
about
this
afternoon
that
ghastly
disturbing
of
the
body
he
smiled
wanly
it
looks
like
me
or
the
ghosts
of
my
ancestors
if
paredes
graham
insisted
tries
to
borrow
any
money
from
you
now
tell
me
about
it
another
thing
bobby
we
ca
afford
to
keep
your
experiences
of
last
night
a
secret
any
longer
he
stepped
to
the
door
and
asked
doctor
groom
to
come
out
he
wo
be
likely
to
pass
your
confidences
on
to
howells
he
said
those
men
are
natural
antagonists
after
a
moment
the
doctor
appeared
a
slouch
hat
drawn
low
over
his
shaggy
forehead
what
you
want
he
grumbled
this
court
a
place
to
catch
cold
dampest
hole
in
the
neighbourhood
often
wondered
why
i
want
to
ask
you
graham
began
something
about
the
effects
of
such
drugs
as
could
be
given
in
wine
tell
him
will
you
bobby
what
happened
last
night
bobby
vanquished
the
discomfort
with
which
the
gruff
opinionated
physician
had
always
filled
him
he
recited
the
story
of
last
dinner
of
his
experience
in
the
cafe
of
his
few
blurred
impressions
of
the
swaying
vehicle
and
the
woods
hartley
thinks
something
may
have
been
put
in
my
wine
what
for
the
doctor
asked
what
had
these
people
to
gain
by
drugging
you
suppose
for
some
reason
they
wanted
to
have
silas
blackburn
put
out
of
the
way
they
could
make
you
do
it
by
drugging
you
at
any
rate
they
could
have
had
a
hand
in
this
afternoon
mind
i
not
saying
you
had
a
thing
to
do
with
it
yourself
but
i
believe
you
were
drugged
any
drug
likely
to
be
used
in
wine
would
probably
have
sent
you
into
a
deep
sleep
and
your
symptoms
on
waking
up
are
scarcely
sharp
enough
sorry
boy
sounds
more
like
aphasia
the
path
you
been
treading
sometimes
leads
to
that
black
country
and
there
that
hates
sharpen
unknown
i
remember
a
case
where
a
tramp
returned
and
killed
a
farmer
who
had
refused
him
food
retained
no
recollection
of
the
crime
hours
dropped
out
of
his
life
they
executed
him
while
he
still
tried
to
remember
i
read
something
about
the
case
bobby
muttered
been
better
if
you
had
the
doctor
grumbled
suggestions
work
in
a
man
brain
without
his
knowing
it
he
thought
for
a
moment
his
heavy
black
brows
coming
closer
together
he
glanced
at
the
windows
of
the
old
room
his
sunken
infused
eyes
nearly
closed
i
know
how
you
feel
and
that
a
little
punishment
maybe
you
deserve
i
say
this
for
your
comfort
you
probably
followed
the
plan
that
had
been
impressed
on
your
brain
by
graham
you
came
here
no
doubt
and
stood
around
with
an
automatic
appreciation
of
your
condition
you
may
have
taken
that
old
precaution
of
convivial
men
returning
home
and
removed
your
shoes
then
your
automatic
judgment
may
have
warned
you
that
you
were
fit
to
go
in
at
all
and
you
probably
wandered
off
to
the
empty
house
then
bobby
asked
you
do
think
i
did
it
god
knows
who
did
it
god
knows
what
did
it
the
longer
i
live
the
surer
i
become
that
we
scientists
ca
probe
everything
whenever
i
go
near
silas
blackburn
body
i
receive
a
very
powerful
impression
that
his
death
in
that
room
from
such
a
wound
goes
deeper
than
ordinary
murder
deeper
than
a
case
of
recurrent
aphasia
his
eyes
widened
he
turned
with
graham
and
bobby
at
the
sound
of
an
automobile
coming
through
the
woods
probably
the
coroner
at
last
he
said
the
automobile
a
small
runabout
drew
up
at
the
entrance
to
the
court
a
little
wizened
man
with
yellowish
skin
stretched
across
high
cheek
bones
stepped
out
and
walked
up
the
path
well
he
said
shrilly
what
you
doing
doctor
groom
waiting
to
witness
another
reason
why
coroners
should
be
abolished
the
doctor
rumbled
this
is
the
dead
man
grandson
coroner
and
graham
a
friend
of
the
family
bobby
accepted
the
coroner
hand
with
distaste
howells
the
coroner
said
in
his
squeaky
voice
seems
to
think
it
a
queer
case
inconvenient
i
call
it
wish
people
would
die
queerly
whenever
i
go
on
a
little
holiday
i
had
got
five
ducks
gentlemen
when
they
came
to
me
with
that
damned
telegram
bad
business
mine
people
will
die
when
you
least
expect
them
to
let
go
see
what
howells
has
got
on
his
mind
bright
sleuth
howells
ought
to
be
in
new
york
he
started
up
the
path
side
by
side
with
doctor
groom
are
you
coming
graham
asked
bobby
bobby
shook
his
head
i
do
want
to
i
rather
stay
outside
you
better
be
there
hartley
graham
followed
the
others
while
bobby
wandered
from
the
court
and
started
down
a
path
that
entered
the
woods
from
the
rear
of
the
house
immediately
the
forest
closed
greedily
about
him
here
and
there
where
the
trees
were
particularly
stunted
branches
cut
against
a
pallid
greenish
glow
in
the
west
the
last
light
bobby
wanted
if
he
could
to
find
that
portion
of
the
woods
where
he
had
stood
last
night
fancying
the
trees
straining
in
the
wind
like
puny
men
visualizing
a
dim
figure
in
a
black
mask
which
he
had
called
his
conscience
the
forest
was
all
of
a
pattern
ugly
unfriendly
melancholy
he
went
on
however
hoping
to
glimpse
that
particular
picture
he
remembered
he
left
the
path
walking
at
haphazard
among
the
undergrowth
ahead
he
saw
a
placid
flat
and
faintly
luminous
stretch
he
pushed
through
the
bushes
and
paused
on
the
shore
of
a
lake
small
and
stagnant
dead
stripped
trunks
of
trees
protruded
from
the
water
at
the
end
a
bird
arose
with
a
sudden
flapping
of
wings
it
cried
angrily
as
it
soared
above
the
trees
and
disappeared
to
the
south
the
morbid
loneliness
of
the
place
touched
bobby
spirit
with
chill
hands
as
a
child
he
had
never
cared
to
play
about
the
stagnant
lake
nor
he
recalled
had
the
boys
of
the
village
fished
or
bathed
there
certainly
he
had
glimpsed
it
last
night
he
was
about
to
walk
away
when
a
movement
on
the
farther
bank
held
him
made
him
gaze
with
eager
eyes
across
the
sleepy
water
he
thought
there
was
something
black
in
the
black
shadows
of
the
trees
a
thing
that
stirred
through
the
heavy
dusk
without
sound
he
received
moreover
an
impression
of
anger
and
haste
as
distinct
as
the
bird
had
projected
but
he
could
see
nothing
clearly
in
this
bad
light
he
could
be
sure
that
there
was
any
one
over
there
he
started
around
the
end
of
the
lake
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
that
the
shape
of
a
woman
clothed
in
black
detached
itself
from
the
shadow
the
image
dissolved
he
wondered
if
it
had
been
more
substantial
than
fancy
who
is
that
he
called
the
woods
muffled
his
voice
there
was
no
answer
nor
was
there
he
noticed
any
crackling
of
twigs
or
rustling
of
dead
leaves
if
there
had
been
a
woman
there
she
had
fled
noiselessly
yet
as
he
went
on
around
the
lake
his
own
progress
was
distinctly
audible
through
the
decay
of
autumn
it
was
too
dark
on
the
other
side
to
detect
any
traces
of
a
recent
human
presence
in
the
thicket
he
could
quiet
however
the
feeling
that
he
had
had
a
glimpse
of
a
woman
clothed
in
black
who
had
studied
him
secretly
across
the
stagnant
stretch
of
the
lake
on
the
other
hand
there
was
no
logic
in
a
woman
presence
here
at
such
an
hour
no
logic
in
a
stranger
running
away
from
him
while
he
pondered
the
night
invaded
the
forest
completely
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
search
farther
it
had
grown
so
dark
indeed
that
he
found
his
way
out
with
difficulty
the
branches
caught
at
his
clothing
the
underbrush
tangled
itself
about
his
feet
it
was
as
if
the
thicket
were
trying
to
hold
him
away
from
the
house
as
he
entered
the
court
he
noticed
a
discoloured
glow
diffusing
itself
through
the
curtains
of
the
room
of
death
he
opened
the
front
door
paredes
and
graham
alone
sat
by
the
fire
then
they
not
through
yet
bobby
said
graham
arose
he
commenced
to
pace
the
length
of
the
hall
they
had
katherine
in
that
room
one
would
think
she
been
through
enough
now
they
sent
for
the
servants
paredes
laughed
lightly
after
this
he
said
i
afraid
bobby
you
need
the
powers
of
the
police
to
keep
servants
in
your
house
muttering
frightened
voices
came
from
the
jenkins
entered
and
shaking
his
head
went
up
the
stairs
the
two
women
who
followed
him
were
in
tears
they
paused
as
if
seeking
an
excuse
to
linger
on
the
lower
floor
to
postpone
as
long
as
possible
their
entrance
of
the
room
of
death
ella
a
pretty
girl
whose
dark
hair
and
eyes
suggested
a
normal
vivacity
spoke
to
bobby
it
outrageous
robert
he
found
out
all
we
knew
this
morning
what
he
after
now
you
might
think
we
murdered
mr
blackburn
jane
was
older
an
ugly
scar
crossed
her
cheek
it
was
red
and
like
an
open
wound
as
she
demanded
that
bobby
put
a
stop
to
these
inquisitions
i
can
do
nothing
he
said
go
on
up
and
answer
or
they
can
make
trouble
for
you
muttering
again
to
each
other
they
followed
jenkins
and
in
the
lower
hall
the
three
men
waited
jenkins
came
down
first
his
face
was
white
it
twitched
the
body
he
mouthed
it
moved
i
saw
it
before
he
stretched
out
his
hands
to
bobby
that
why
they
wanted
us
to
find
out
where
we
were
this
afternoon
and
everything
we
done
as
if
we
might
have
gone
there
and
disturbed
angry
voices
in
the
upper
hall
interrupted
him
the
two
women
ran
down
as
white
as
jenkins
at
an
impatient
nod
from
bobby
the
three
servants
went
on
to
the
kitchen
howells
the
coroner
and
doctor
groom
descended
what
ails
you
doctor
the
coroner
was
squeaking
i
agree
it
an
unpleasant
room
lots
of
old
rooms
are
i
follow
you
when
you
say
no
contraction
would
have
caused
such
an
alteration
in
the
position
of
the
body
there
no
question
about
the
rest
of
it
the
man
was
clearly
murdered
with
a
sharp
tool
of
some
sort
and
the
murderer
was
in
the
room
again
this
afternoon
and
disturbed
the
corpse
howells
says
he
knows
who
it
up
to
him
to
find
out
how
he
says
he
has
plenty
of
evidence
and
that
the
guilty
person
in
this
house
so
i
not
fretting
myself
i
cross
with
you
howells
for
breaking
up
my
holiday
one
of
my
assistants
would
have
done
as
well
howells
apparently
paid
no
attention
to
the
coroner
his
narrow
eyes
followed
the
doctor
with
a
growing
curiosity
his
level
smile
seemed
to
have
drawn
his
lips
into
a
line
inflexible
a
little
cruel
the
doctor
grunted
instead
of
abolishing
coroners
we
ought
to
double
their
salaries
the
coroner
made
a
long
squeak
as
an
indication
of
mirth
you
think
unfriendly
spooks
did
it
i
always
believed
you
were
an
old
fogy
hanged
if
that
does
sound
modern
the
doctor
ran
his
fingers
through
his
thick
untidy
hair
i
merely
ask
for
the
implement
that
caused
death
i
only
ask
to
know
how
it
was
inserted
through
the
bed
while
blackburn
lay
on
his
back
and
if
you
time
you
might
tell
me
how
the
murderer
entered
the
room
last
night
and
the
coroner
repeated
his
squeak
he
glanced
at
the
little
group
by
the
fire
out
in
the
kitchen
upstairs
or
right
here
under
our
noses
is
almost
certainly
the
person
who
could
tell
us
interesting
case
howells
howells
who
still
watched
the
doctor
answered
dryly
unusually
interesting
the
coroner
struggled
into
his
coat
permits
are
all
available
he
squeaked
have
your
undertakers
out
when
you
like
graham
answered
him
brusquely
everything
arranged
i
only
to
telephone
the
coroner
nodded
at
doctor
groom
his
voice
pointed
its
humour
with
a
thinner
tone
if
i
were
you
howells
i
take
this
hairy
old
theorist
up
as
a
suspicious
character
the
doctor
made
a
movement
in
his
direction
while
howells
continued
to
stare
the
doctor
checked
himself
he
went
to
the
closet
and
got
his
hat
and
coat
want
me
to
drop
you
old
sawbones
the
coroner
asked
savagely
the
doctor
shook
his
head
my
buggy
in
the
stable
the
coroner
squeak
was
thinner
more
irritating
than
ever
then
do
let
the
spooks
get
you
driving
through
the
woods
old
folks
say
there
are
there
bobby
arose
he
could
face
the
prospect
of
the
man
squeaking
again
we
find
nothing
to
laugh
at
in
this
situation
he
said
quite
through
the
coroner
eyes
blazed
i
through
if
that
the
way
you
feel
goodnight
he
added
with
a
sharp
maliciousness
i
leave
my
sympathy
for
whoever
howells
has
his
eagle
eye
on
howells
when
the
doctor
and
the
coroner
had
gone
excused
himself
with
a
humility
that
mocked
the
others
with
your
permission
i
shall
write
in
the
library
until
dinner
he
bowed
and
left
he
wants
to
work
on
his
report
graham
suggested
an
exceptional
man
paredes
murmured
has
he
questioned
you
graham
asked
i
scarcely
call
it
that
paredes
replied
we
both
questioned
and
we
both
been
clams
i
fancy
he
does
think
much
of
me
since
i
believe
in
ghosts
yet
the
doctor
seems
to
interest
him
where
were
you
graham
asked
when
miss
perrine
scream
called
us
paredes
stifled
a
yawn
dozing
here
by
the
fire
i
am
very
tired
after
last
night
you
do
look
particularly
tired
custom
i
ashamed
to
say
constructs
a
certain
armour
with
a
fresh
mind
i
hope
to
be
able
to
dissect
all
i
have
seen
and
heard
all
that
has
happened
here
the
thing
that
counts
is
what
happened
to
me
last
night
carlos
bobby
said
it
the
only
way
you
can
help
me
as
paredes
strolled
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
bobby
waited
for
a
defensive
reply
for
a
sign
perhaps
that
the
panamanian
was
offended
and
proposed
to
depart
paredes
however
went
upstairs
yawning
he
called
back
i
must
make
myself
a
trifle
more
presentable
for
dinner
graham
faced
bobby
with
the
old
question
what
can
he
want
hanging
around
here
unless
it
money
and
after
a
moment
he
clever
hard
to
sound
i
have
to
leave
you
bobby
i
must
telephone
the
ugly
formalities
it
good
of
you
to
take
them
off
my
mind
bobby
answered
he
remained
in
his
chair
gazing
drowsily
at
the
fire
trying
always
trying
to
remember
yet
finding
no
new
light
among
the
shadows
of
his
memory
just
before
dinner
katherine
joined
him
she
wore
a
sombre
gown
that
made
her
face
seem
too
white
that
heightened
the
groping
curiosity
of
her
eyes
without
speaking
she
sat
down
beside
him
and
stared
too
at
the
smouldering
fire
from
her
presence
from
her
tactful
silence
he
drew
comfort
to
an
extent
rest
you
make
me
ashamed
he
whispered
once
i
been
a
beast
leaving
you
here
alone
these
weeks
you
do
understand
quite
why
that
was
she
would
let
him
go
on
she
shook
her
head
they
remained
silently
by
the
fire
until
graham
and
paredes
joined
them
when
dinner
was
announced
the
detective
came
from
the
library
and
uninvited
sat
at
the
table
with
them
his
report
evidently
still
filled
his
mind
for
he
spoke
only
when
it
was
unavoidable
and
then
in
monosyllables
paredes
alone
ate
with
a
show
of
enjoyment
alone
attempted
to
talk
eventually
even
he
fell
silent
before
the
lack
of
response
afterward
he
arranged
a
small
card
table
by
the
fire
in
the
hall
he
found
cards
and
with
a
package
of
cigarettes
and
a
box
of
matches
convenient
to
his
hand
commenced
to
play
solitaire
the
detective
bobby
gathered
had
brought
his
report
up
to
date
for
he
lounged
near
by
watching
the
panamanian
slender
fingers
as
they
handled
the
cards
deftly
bobby
graham
and
katherine
were
glad
to
withdraw
beyond
the
range
of
those
narrow
searching
eyes
they
entered
the
library
and
closed
the
door
graham
expectant
of
a
report
from
his
man
in
new
york
as
to
the
movements
of
maria
and
the
identity
of
the
stranger
was
restless
if
we
could
only
get
one
fact
he
said
one
reasonable
clue
that
did
involve
bobby
i
never
felt
so
at
sea
i
wonder
if
in
spite
of
howells
evidence
we
not
all
a
little
afraid
since
this
afternoon
of
something
such
as
katherine
felt
last
night
something
we
define
howells
alone
is
satisfied
we
must
believe
in
the
hand
of
another
man
doctor
groom
talks
about
indefinable
hands
uncle
silas
was
so
afraid
last
night
katherine
whispered
that
bobby
cried
is
the
fact
we
must
have
he
paused
what
that
he
asked
sharply
they
sat
for
some
time
listening
to
the
sound
of
wheels
on
the
gravel
to
the
banging
of
the
front
door
and
later
to
the
pacing
of
men
in
the
room
of
death
overhead
they
tried
again
to
thread
the
mazes
of
this
problem
whose
only
conceivable
exit
led
to
bobby
guilt
the
movements
upstairs
persisted
at
last
they
became
measured
and
dragging
like
the
footsteps
of
men
who
carried
some
heavy
burden
they
looked
at
each
other
then
katherine
hid
her
eyes
it
like
a
tomb
here
bobby
said
he
arranged
kindling
in
the
fireplace
and
touched
a
match
to
it
it
had
occurred
to
him
to
ring
for
jenkins
none
of
them
wished
to
be
disturbed
eventually
it
was
the
detective
who
intruded
he
strolled
in
glanced
at
them
curiously
for
a
moment
then
walked
to
the
door
of
the
enclosed
staircase
he
grasped
the
knob
he
announced
i
am
trying
a
small
experiment
on
the
chance
of
clearing
up
the
last
details
of
the
mystery
since
it
depends
on
the
courage
of
whoever
murdered
blackburn
i
small
hope
of
its
success
he
indicated
the
ceiling
you
heard
i
daresay
what
been
going
on
up
there
blackburn
body
has
been
removed
to
his
own
room
the
room
where
he
was
killed
is
empty
i
mean
to
go
up
and
enter
and
lock
the
doors
as
he
did
last
night
i
shall
leave
the
window
up
as
it
was
last
night
i
shall
blow
out
the
candle
as
he
did
he
lowered
his
voice
he
looked
directly
at
bobby
his
words
carried
a
definite
challenge
i
shall
lie
on
the
bed
and
await
the
murderer
under
the
precise
conditions
blackburn
did
what
do
you
expect
to
gain
by
that
graham
asked
probably
nothing
howells
answered
because
as
i
have
said
success
depends
upon
the
courage
of
a
man
who
kills
in
the
dark
while
his
victim
sleeps
i
simply
give
him
the
chance
to
attack
me
as
he
did
blackburn
of
course
he
realizes
it
would
be
a
good
deal
to
his
advantage
to
have
me
out
of
the
way
i
ask
him
to
come
therefore
as
stealthily
as
he
did
last
night
i
beg
him
to
match
his
skill
with
mine
i
want
him
to
play
his
miracle
with
the
window
or
one
of
the
locks
but
i
wager
he
has
the
nerve
although
i
do
see
why
he
should
hesitate
he
a
doomed
man
i
shall
make
my
arrest
in
the
morning
i
shall
publish
all
my
evidence
bobby
would
meet
the
narrow
menacing
eyes
for
he
knew
that
howells
challenged
him
to
a
duel
of
slyness
with
the
whole
truth
at
stake
the
detective
manner
increased
the
hatred
which
had
blazed
in
bobby
mind
when
he
had
stood
in
the
bedroom
over
his
grandfather
body
for
a
moment
he
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
might
accept
the
challenge
he
did
the
best
he
could
i
gather
he
said
that
you
have
unearthed
the
motive
for
disturbing
the
body
and
have
you
found
the
sharp
instrument
that
caused
death
the
detective
answered
tolerantly
i
have
found
a
number
of
sharp
instruments
none
of
them
however
seems
quite
slender
or
round
enough
i
get
all
that
out
of
my
man
when
i
lock
him
up
i
get
it
if
he
dares
come
why
graham
said
do
you
announce
your
plans
so
accurately
to
us
the
detective
level
smile
widened
you
should
ask
that
graham
i
caused
the
servants
to
know
my
plans
paredes
knows
them
i
wish
every
one
in
the
house
to
know
them
that
is
in
order
that
the
murderer
who
is
in
the
house
may
come
if
he
wishes
katherine
arose
abruptly
when
you
come
down
to
it
she
said
you
are
accusing
one
of
us
brutal
unfair
absurd
i
am
a
detective
miss
howells
answered
i
have
my
own
methods
bobby
stared
at
the
slight
protuberance
in
the
breast
pocket
of
the
detective
coat
the
cast
of
his
footprint
must
be
secreted
there
and
almost
certainly
the
handkerchief
which
had
been
found
beneath
the
bed
he
shrank
from
his
own
thoughts
if
he
had
consciously
committed
this
murder
he
could
understand
a
desire
to
get
that
evidence
katherine
had
gone
closer
to
the
detective
in
any
case
she
urged
him
i
wish
you
would
try
to
spend
the
night
in
that
room
it
is
pleasant
after
what
the
doctor
has
said
it
well
it
is
safe
howells
burst
out
laughing
never
fear
miss
i
content
to
give
doctor
groom
spirits
as
much
chance
to
take
a
fall
out
of
me
as
anybody
i
be
going
up
now
he
bowed
to
you
all
and
pleasant
dreams
he
opened
the
door
and
slipped
into
the
darkness
of
the
private
staircase
they
heard
him
after
he
had
closed
the
door
climbing
upward
katherine
shivered
he
has
plenty
of
courage
hartley
if
nothing
happens
to
him
he
finish
bobby
in
the
morning
that
must
happen
he
must
go
to
jail
you
understand
things
would
never
be
the
same
for
him
again
graham
spread
his
hands
what
am
i
to
do
i
might
go
to
new
york
and
get
after
these
people
myself
do
leave
the
cedars
bobby
begged
until
he
does
arrest
me
there
be
plenty
of
time
for
the
new
york
end
then
i
no
faith
in
it
watch
carlos
if
you
want
but
most
important
of
all
find
out
somehow
you
got
to
find
out
what
my
grandfather
was
afraid
of
graham
nodded
and
if
it
does
come
to
an
arrest
bobby
you
not
to
say
a
word
to
anybody
without
my
advice
you
ought
to
get
to
bed
now
you
must
have
rest
and
katherine
too
do
listen
katherine
for
messages
from
across
the
court
i
try
she
said
but
hartley
i
wish
that
man
was
there
i
wish
no
one
was
in
that
room
she
took
bobby
hand
bobby
and
do
give
up
hope
we
do
something
somehow
we
pull
you
through
bobby
waited
hoping
that
graham
would
offer
to
share
his
room
with
him
for
as
he
had
said
earlier
the
prospect
of
going
to
sleep
of
losing
control
of
his
thoughts
and
actions
appalled
him
yet
such
an
offer
he
realized
must
impress
graham
as
delicate
as
an
indication
that
he
really
doubted
bobby
innocence
as
a
sort
of
spying
he
surprised
therefore
when
graham
only
said
i
be
in
the
next
room
bobby
if
you
restless
or
need
me
only
to
knock
on
the
wall
bobby
did
leave
the
library
with
them
the
warmth
with
which
katherine
had
just
filled
him
faded
as
he
watched
her
go
out
side
by
side
with
graham
her
hand
was
on
graham
arm
there
was
he
fancied
in
her
eyes
an
emotion
deeper
than
gratitude
or
friendship
he
sighed
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
he
was
himself
largely
to
blame
for
that
situation
his
very
revolt
against
its
imminence
had
hastened
its
shaping
he
walked
anxiously
to
the
table
he
had
remembered
the
medicine
doctor
groom
had
prepared
for
him
that
afternoon
to
make
him
sleep
he
taken
it
then
if
it
remained
where
he
had
left
it
which
was
likely
enough
in
the
disordered
state
of
the
household
he
would
drink
it
now
reinforced
by
his
complete
weariness
it
ought
to
send
him
into
a
sleep
profound
enough
to
drown
any
possible
abnormal
impulses
of
unconsciousness
the
glass
was
there
he
drained
it
and
stood
for
a
time
looking
at
the
pinkish
sediment
in
the
bottom
that
was
all
right
for
but
afterward
he
could
shrink
perpetually
from
sleep
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
remembering
it
would
make
little
difference
what
he
did
in
his
sleep
when
they
had
him
behind
prison
bars
perhaps
this
would
be
his
last
night
of
freedom
he
found
paredes
still
in
the
hall
the
panamanian
with
languid
gestures
continued
to
play
his
solitaire
his
box
of
cigarettes
was
much
reduced
i
thought
you
were
tired
carlos
paredes
glanced
up
his
eyes
were
neither
weary
nor
alert
as
usual
his
expression
disclosed
nothing
of
his
thoughts
yet
he
must
have
read
in
bobby
tone
a
reproach
at
this
indifference
the
game
intrigues
me
he
murmured
and
you
know
he
added
dreamily
i
sometimes
think
better
while
i
amuse
myself
bobby
nodded
and
went
on
up
to
his
room
even
while
he
undressed
the
effects
of
the
doctor
narcotic
were
perceptible
his
eyes
had
grown
heavy
his
brain
a
trifle
numb
almost
apathetically
he
assured
himself
that
he
could
accomplish
these
mad
actions
in
his
sleep
yet
last
night
he
murmured
that
finishes
me
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
the
doctor
will
testify
to
aphasia
according
to
him
i
am
two
men
two
men
he
yawned
recalling
snatches
of
books
he
had
read
and
one
or
two
scientific
reports
of
such
cases
he
climbed
into
bed
and
blew
out
his
candle
his
drowsiness
thickened
in
his
dulled
mind
one
recollection
remained
the
picture
of
howells
coldly
challenging
him
with
his
level
smile
to
make
a
secret
entrance
of
the
old
bedroom
in
a
murderous
effort
to
escape
the
penalty
of
the
earlier
crime
and
howells
had
been
right
his
death
would
give
bobby
a
chance
the
destruction
of
the
evidence
the
bringing
into
the
case
of
a
man
a
man
without
a
carefully
constructed
theory
all
that
would
help
bobby
might
save
him
howells
moreover
had
indicated
that
he
had
so
far
withheld
his
evidence
but
that
was
probably
a
bait
in
his
drowsy
way
bobby
hated
more
powerfully
than
before
this
detective
who
with
a
serene
malevolence
made
him
writhe
in
his
net
thought
ceased
he
drifted
into
a
sleep
he
swung
in
the
black
pit
again
fighting
out
against
crushing
odds
the
darkness
thundered
as
though
informing
him
that
graver
forces
than
any
he
had
ever
imagined
had
definitely
grasped
him
then
he
understood
he
was
in
a
black
cell
and
the
thundering
was
the
steady
advance
of
men
along
an
iron
floor
to
take
him
bobby
bobby
he
flung
out
his
hands
he
sat
upright
opening
his
eyes
the
blackness
assumed
the
familiar
yielding
quality
of
the
night
the
thunder
the
footfalls
became
a
hurried
knocking
at
his
door
bobby
you
there
it
was
katherine
her
tone
made
the
night
as
frightening
as
the
blackness
of
the
pit
what
the
matter
you
there
i
did
know
get
up
hartley
putting
some
clothes
on
hurry
the
house
is
so
dark
so
strange
tell
me
what
happened
she
did
answer
at
first
he
struck
a
match
lighted
his
candle
threw
on
a
dressing
gown
and
stepped
to
the
door
katherine
shrank
against
the
wall
hiding
her
eyes
from
the
light
of
his
candle
he
thought
it
odd
she
should
wear
the
dress
in
which
she
had
appeared
at
dinner
but
it
seemed
indifferently
fastened
and
her
hair
was
in
disorder
graham
stepped
from
his
room
what
is
it
bobby
demanded
you
would
wake
up
bobby
you
were
so
hard
to
wake
the
idea
seemed
to
fill
her
mind
she
repeated
it
several
times
it
nothing
graham
said
go
back
to
your
room
katherine
fanciful
she
lowered
her
hands
her
eyes
were
full
of
terror
no
we
have
to
go
to
that
room
as
i
went
last
night
as
we
went
graham
tried
to
quiet
her
we
go
to
satisfy
you
her
voice
hardened
i
know
i
was
asleep
it
woke
me
up
stealing
in
across
the
court
again
bobby
grasped
her
arm
you
came
out
and
aroused
up
at
once
she
shook
her
head
i
i
could
find
my
dressing
gown
this
dress
was
by
the
bed
i
put
it
on
but
i
could
seem
to
fasten
it
bobby
stepped
back
remembering
his
last
thought
before
drifting
into
the
sleep
she
seemed
to
know
what
was
in
his
mind
but
when
i
knocked
you
were
sleeping
so
soundly
too
soundly
perhaps
come
we
growing
imaginative
graham
said
howells
would
take
care
of
himself
he
probably
give
us
the
deuce
for
disturbing
him
but
to
satisfy
you
katherine
we
wake
him
up
if
you
can
she
whispered
they
entered
the
main
hall
light
came
through
the
stair
well
from
the
lower
floor
graham
walked
to
the
rail
and
glanced
down
bobby
followed
him
on
the
table
by
the
fireplace
the
cards
were
arranged
in
neat
piles
a
strong
draft
blew
cigarette
smoke
up
to
them
paredes
graham
said
amazed
is
still
downstairs
the
front
open
he
probably
in
the
court
it
must
be
very
late
bobby
said
katherine
shivered
two
i
looked
at
my
watch
the
same
time
as
last
night
with
a
gesture
of
resolution
she
led
the
way
into
the
corridor
bobby
shrank
from
the
damp
and
musty
atmosphere
of
the
narrow
passage
why
do
you
come
katherine
he
asked
i
have
to
know
as
i
had
to
know
last
night
graham
raised
his
hand
and
knocked
at
the
door
which
again
was
locked
on
the
inside
the
echoes
chattered
back
at
them
graham
knocked
again
with
a
passionate
revolt
katherine
raised
her
hands
too
and
pounded
at
the
panels
suddenly
she
gave
up
she
let
her
hands
fall
listlessly
it
no
use
howells
howells
graham
called
why
do
you
answer
when
he
boasted
katherine
whispered
the
murderer
heard
him
suppose
he
gone
down
to
the
library
graham
said
bobby
gave
katherine
the
candle
no
he
have
stayed
we
got
to
break
in
here
we
got
to
find
out
graham
placed
his
powerful
shoulder
against
the
door
the
lock
strained
bobby
added
his
weight
with
a
splintering
of
wood
the
door
flew
open
precipitating
them
across
the
threshold
through
the
darkness
graham
sprang
for
the
opposite
door
it
locked
he
called
and
the
key
on
this
side
bobby
took
the
candle
from
katherine
and
forced
himself
to
approach
the
bed
the
flame
flickered
a
little
in
the
breeze
which
stole
past
the
curtain
of
the
open
window
it
shook
across
the
body
of
howells
fully
clothed
with
his
head
on
the
stained
pillow
his
face
intricately
lined
was
as
peaceful
as
silas
blackburn
had
been
its
level
smile
persisted
bobby
caught
his
breath
howells
he
set
the
candle
on
the
bureau
it
no
use
we
must
look
at
the
back
of
his
head
the
back
of
his
head
katherine
echoed
it
illegal
graham
said
look
bobby
cried
we
got
to
look
graham
tiptoed
forward
he
stretched
out
his
hand
with
a
motion
of
abhorrence
he
drew
it
back
bobby
watched
him
hypnotically
thinking
i
wanted
this
i
hated
him
i
thought
of
it
just
before
i
went
to
sleep
graham
reached
out
again
this
time
he
touched
howells
head
it
rolled
over
on
the
pillow
good
god
he
said
they
stared
at
the
red
hole
near
the
base
of
the
brain
at
a
fresh
crimson
splotch
straying
beyond
the
edges
of
the
darker
one
they
had
seen
that
afternoon
graham
turned
away
his
hand
still
outstretched
as
if
it
had
touched
some
poisonous
thing
and
might
retain
a
contamination
he
was
prepared
against
it
he
whispered
expected
it
yet
it
got
him
he
glanced
rapidly
around
the
room
whose
shadows
seemed
crowding
about
the
candle
to
stifle
it
unless
we
all
mad
he
cried
the
murderer
must
be
hidden
in
this
room
now
do
you
see
he
got
to
be
or
groom
right
and
fighting
the
dead
go
out
katherine
stand
by
that
broken
door
bobby
i
going
to
look
chapter
iv
a
strange
light
appears
at
the
deserted
house
graham
intention
logical
as
it
was
impressed
bobby
as
quite
futile
silas
blackburn
had
died
in
this
ancient
melancholy
room
behind
locked
doors
this
afternoon
with
a
repetition
of
the
sounds
that
had
probably
accompanied
his
death
they
had
been
drawn
to
find
that
behind
locked
doors
again
the
position
of
the
body
had
changed
incredibly
as
if
to
expose
to
them
the
tiny
fatal
wound
at
the
base
of
the
brain
now
for
the
third
time
those
stealthy
movements
had
aroused
katherine
and
they
had
found
once
more
behind
locked
doors
the
determined
and
malicious
detective
murdered
precisely
as
old
blackburn
had
been
of
course
graham
was
logical
by
every
rational
argument
the
murderer
must
still
be
in
the
room
yet
bobby
foresaw
that
as
always
no
one
would
be
found
that
nothing
would
be
unearthed
to
explain
the
succession
of
tragic
mysteries
while
graham
commenced
his
search
indeed
he
continued
to
stare
at
the
little
round
hole
in
howells
head
at
the
fresh
irregular
stain
on
the
pillow
and
he
became
absorbed
in
his
own
predicament
again
and
again
he
asked
himself
if
he
could
be
responsible
for
these
murders
which
had
been
committed
with
an
inhuman
ingenuity
he
knew
only
that
he
had
wandered
unconscious
in
the
vicinity
of
the
cedars
last
night
that
he
had
been
asleep
when
his
grandfather
body
had
altered
its
position
that
he
had
gone
to
sleep
a
little
while
ago
too
profoundly
brooding
over
howells
challenge
to
the
murderer
to
invade
the
room
of
death
and
kill
him
if
he
could
howells
had
been
confident
that
he
could
handle
a
man
and
so
solve
the
riddle
of
how
the
room
had
been
entered
certainly
howells
challenge
had
been
accepted
and
bobby
knew
that
he
had
fallen
into
that
deep
sleep
hating
the
detective
telling
himself
that
the
man
death
might
save
him
from
arrest
from
conviction
from
an
intolerable
walk
to
a
little
room
with
a
single
chair
recurrent
aphasia
the
doctor
expression
came
back
to
him
in
such
a
state
a
man
could
overcome
locked
doors
could
accomplish
apparent
miracles
and
retain
no
recollection
and
bobby
had
hated
and
feared
howells
more
than
he
had
his
grandfather
dully
he
saw
katherine
go
out
at
graham
direction
as
one
in
a
dream
he
moved
toward
the
door
they
had
had
to
break
down
on
entering
stand
close
to
it
graham
said
we
cover
everything
you
find
no
one
bobby
answered
with
a
perfect
assurance
he
saw
graham
take
the
candle
and
explore
the
large
closets
he
watched
him
examine
the
spaces
behind
the
window
curtains
he
could
smile
a
little
as
graham
stooped
peering
beneath
the
bed
as
he
moved
each
piece
of
furniture
large
enough
to
secrete
a
man
you
see
hartley
it
no
use
graham
lack
of
success
however
stimulated
his
anger
then
he
said
there
must
be
some
hiding
place
in
the
walls
such
devices
are
common
in
houses
as
old
as
this
bobby
indicated
the
silent
form
of
the
detective
he
believed
i
killed
my
grandfather
the
only
reason
he
did
arrest
me
was
his
failure
to
find
out
how
the
room
had
been
entered
and
left
you
suppose
he
looked
for
a
hiding
place
or
a
secret
entrance
the
first
thing
it
obvious
but
graham
savage
determination
increased
he
sounded
each
panel
none
gave
the
slightest
revealing
response
he
got
a
tape
from
katherine
and
measured
the
dimensions
of
the
room
the
private
hall
and
the
corridor
at
last
he
turned
to
bobby
his
anger
dead
his
face
white
and
tired
everything
checks
he
admitted
there
no
secret
room
no
way
in
or
out
logically
groom
right
we
fighting
the
dead
who
resent
the
intrusion
of
your
grandfather
and
howells
he
laughed
mirthlessly
after
all
we
ca
surrender
to
that
there
must
be
another
answer
from
the
first
howells
was
satisfied
with
me
bobby
said
graham
flung
up
his
hands
then
tell
me
how
you
got
in
without
disturbing
those
locks
i
grant
you
bobby
you
had
sufficient
motive
for
both
murders
but
i
do
believe
you
have
two
personalities
one
decent
and
lovable
the
other
cruel
and
cunning
to
the
point
of
magic
i
do
believe
if
a
man
had
two
such
personalities
the
actions
of
one
would
be
totally
closed
to
the
memory
of
the
other
bobby
smiled
wanly
it
is
pleasant
to
confess
it
hartley
but
i
have
read
of
such
cases
fiction
scientific
fact
i
wish
to
the
devil
i
had
shared
your
room
with
you
graham
muttered
i
might
have
furnished
you
an
alibi
for
this
affair
at
least
either
that
bobby
answered
frankly
or
you
might
have
followed
me
and
learned
the
whole
secret
honestly
is
that
what
you
were
thinking
of
hartley
and
i
did
go
to
sleep
telling
myself
it
would
help
me
if
something
of
the
sort
happened
to
howells
now
i
not
so
sure
that
it
will
i
i
suppose
you
got
to
notify
the
police
graham
held
up
his
hand
what
that
in
the
corridor
there
were
quiet
footsteps
in
the
corridor
bobby
turned
quickly
paredes
strolled
slowly
through
the
passage
a
cigarette
held
in
his
slender
listless
fingers
bobby
stared
at
him
remembering
his
surprise
a
few
minutes
ago
that
the
panamanian
should
have
sat
up
so
late
should
have
been
probably
in
the
court
when
they
had
followed
katherine
to
the
discovery
of
this
new
crime
paredes
paused
in
the
doorway
he
took
in
the
tragic
picture
framed
by
the
sinister
room
without
displaying
the
slightest
interest
he
continued
to
hold
his
cigarette
until
it
expired
then
he
crossed
the
threshold
graham
and
bobby
watched
the
expressionless
face
gracefully
paredes
raised
his
finger
and
pointed
to
the
bed
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
low
and
pleasant
appalling
i
feared
something
of
the
kind
when
i
heard
you
come
to
this
room
he
glanced
at
the
broken
door
the
same
unbelievable
circumstance
he
drawled
i
see
you
had
to
break
in
the
colour
flashed
back
to
graham
face
you
have
taken
plenty
of
time
to
solve
your
misgivings
it
has
been
so
long
i
fancied
everything
was
all
right
and
i
was
immersed
in
my
solitaire
then
i
heard
a
stirring
upstairs
as
i
told
you
the
house
frightens
me
it
is
not
natural
or
healthy
so
i
came
up
to
investigate
this
stirring
and
there
was
miss
katherine
in
the
hall
she
told
me
graham
faced
him
with
undisguised
enmity
immersed
in
your
solitaire
we
were
attracted
by
a
light
in
the
lower
hall
at
such
an
hour
we
looked
down
you
were
not
there
the
front
door
was
open
paredes
glanced
at
his
cold
cigarette
he
yawned
when
howells
died
precisely
as
blackburn
did
graham
hurried
on
you
alone
were
awake
about
the
house
were
you
at
that
moment
in
the
court
paredes
laughed
tolerantly
it
is
clear
in
spite
of
my
apologies
that
we
are
not
friends
graham
but
may
i
ask
are
you
accusing
me
of
this
strange
accident
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
were
doing
in
the
court
perhaps
paredes
answered
i
was
attracted
there
by
the
sounds
that
aroused
miss
katherine
graham
shook
his
head
from
her
description
i
doubt
if
those
sounds
would
have
been
audible
in
the
hall
no
matter
paredes
said
i
merely
suggest
that
it
a
case
for
groom
his
hint
of
a
spiritual
enmity
may
be
saner
than
you
think
katherine
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
had
evidently
overheard
comment
for
she
nodded
the
determination
in
her
eyes
suggested
that
she
had
struggled
with
the
situation
during
these
last
moments
and
had
reached
a
definite
conclusions
that
quality
was
in
her
voice
at
least
hartley
she
said
you
must
send
for
doctor
groom
before
you
notify
the
police
graham
waved
his
hand
why
he
asked
the
man
is
dead
with
a
movement
hidden
from
paredes
she
indicated
bobby
last
time
there
was
a
good
deal
of
delay
before
the
doctor
came
if
we
get
him
right
away
he
may
be
able
to
do
something
for
this
poor
fellow
at
least
his
advice
would
be
useful
bobby
realized
that
she
was
fighting
for
time
for
him
any
delay
would
be
useful
that
would
give
them
a
chance
to
plan
before
the
police
with
unimaginative
efficiency
should
invade
the
house
and
limit
their
opportunities
graham
showed
that
he
caught
her
point
maybe
it
better
he
said
then
bobby
telephone
groom
to
be
ready
for
you
and
take
my
runabout
it
in
the
stable
you
get
him
here
much
faster
than
he
could
come
in
his
carriage
while
i
gone
bobby
asked
what
will
you
do
watch
this
room
graham
jerked
out
see
that
no
one
enters
or
leaves
it
or
touches
the
body
i
hope
for
some
clue
you
plenty
of
courage
paredes
drawled
i
should
care
to
watch
alone
in
this
room
he
followed
katherine
into
the
corridor
bobby
looked
at
graham
you
take
no
chances
hartley
graham
smile
was
pleasant
according
to
you
and
the
dead
detective
there
no
risk
while
you
out
of
the
house
still
i
shall
be
nervous
but
do
worry
bobby
joined
the
others
before
they
had
reached
the
hall
of
course
hartley
found
nothing
katherine
said
to
him
nothing
paredes
answered
except
a
very
bad
temper
katherine
distaste
for
the
man
was
no
longer
veiled
you
do
like
graham
she
said
but
he
is
our
friend
and
he
is
in
this
house
to
help
us
paredes
bowed
i
regret
that
the
amusement
graham
causes
me
sometimes
finds
expression
he
is
so
earnest
so
materialistic
in
his
relation
to
the
world
that
is
why
he
will
see
nothing
psychic
in
the
situation
paredes
easy
contempt
was
like
a
tonic
for
katherine
her
fear
seemed
to
drop
from
her
she
turned
purposefully
to
bobby
ignoring
the
panamanian
i
shall
watch
with
hartley
she
said
he
was
ashamed
that
jealousy
should
creep
into
such
a
moment
but
her
resolve
recalled
his
amorous
discontent
the
prospect
of
graham
and
her
watching
alone
drawn
to
each
other
by
their
fright
and
uncertainty
by
their
surroundings
by
the
hour
became
unbearable
it
placed
him
to
an
extent
on
paredes
side
it
urged
him
when
paredes
had
gone
on
downstairs
to
spring
almost
eagerly
to
his
defence
as
hartley
says
katherine
began
he
makes
you
think
of
a
snake
he
must
see
we
dislike
and
resent
him
you
and
hartley
perhaps
bobby
said
carlos
says
he
is
here
to
help
me
i
no
reason
to
disbelieve
him
a
little
colour
came
into
katherine
face
she
half
stretched
out
her
hand
as
if
in
an
appeal
but
the
colour
faded
and
her
hand
dropped
we
are
wasting
time
she
said
you
had
better
go
i
am
sorry
we
disagree
about
carlos
he
commenced
she
turned
deliberately
away
from
him
you
must
hurry
she
said
hurry
he
saw
her
enter
the
corridor
to
join
graham
the
obscurity
of
the
narrow
place
seemed
to
hold
for
him
a
new
menace
he
walked
downstairs
slowly
while
he
telephoned
instructing
a
servant
to
tell
the
doctor
to
be
dressed
and
ready
in
twenty
minutes
he
saw
paredes
go
to
the
closet
and
get
his
hat
and
coat
i
shall
keep
you
company
the
panamanian
announced
bobby
was
glad
enough
to
have
him
he
did
want
to
be
alone
he
was
aware
by
this
time
that
no
amount
of
thought
would
persuade
useful
memories
to
emerge
from
the
black
pit
they
walked
to
the
stable
half
gone
to
ruin
like
the
rest
of
the
estate
bobby
started
graham
car
the
servants
quarters
he
saw
were
dark
then
jenkins
and
the
two
women
had
been
aroused
were
still
ignorant
of
the
new
crime
as
they
drove
smoothly
past
the
gloomy
house
they
glimpsed
through
the
court
the
dimly
lit
windows
of
the
old
room
that
persistently
guarded
its
grim
secret
bobby
pictured
the
living
as
well
as
the
dead
there
and
his
mind
revolted
and
he
shivered
he
opened
the
throttle
wider
the
car
sprang
forward
the
divergent
glare
from
the
headlights
forced
back
the
reluctant
thicket
paredes
drawled
unexpectedly
there
is
nothing
as
lonely
anywhere
in
the
world
he
stooped
behind
the
windshield
and
lighted
a
cigarette
at
least
bobby
he
said
between
puffs
the
cedars
has
taken
from
you
the
fear
of
howells
and
after
a
time
staring
at
the
glow
of
his
cigarette
he
went
on
softly
have
you
noticed
anything
significant
about
the
discovery
of
each
mystery
at
the
cedars
many
things
bobby
muttered
think
paredes
urged
him
bobby
answered
angrily
you
suggested
that
to
me
once
carlos
you
mean
that
each
time
i
have
been
asleep
or
unconscious
i
mean
something
quite
different
paredes
said
he
hesitated
when
he
continued
his
drawl
was
more
pronounced
then
you
have
remarked
that
each
time
it
has
been
miss
katherine
who
has
made
the
discovery
who
has
aroused
the
rest
of
the
house
the
car
swerved
sharply
bobby
first
impulse
had
been
to
take
his
hands
from
the
wheel
to
force
paredes
to
retract
his
sly
insinuation
that
the
rottenest
thing
i
ever
known
you
to
do
carlos
take
it
back
paredes
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
is
nothing
to
take
back
i
accuse
no
one
i
merely
call
attention
to
a
chain
of
exceptional
coincidences
you
make
me
wonder
bobby
said
if
hartley
is
justified
in
his
dislike
of
you
you
kill
such
a
ridiculous
suspicion
or
paredes
drawled
very
well
it
seems
my
fate
recently
to
offend
those
i
like
best
i
merely
thought
that
any
theory
leading
away
from
you
would
be
welcome
any
theory
bobby
answered
involving
katherine
is
unthinkable
paredes
smiled
i
did
understand
exactly
how
you
felt
i
rather
took
it
for
granted
that
graham
never
mind
i
take
it
back
then
drop
it
bobby
answered
sullenly
sorry
that
there
was
nothing
else
he
could
say
they
continued
in
silence
through
the
deserted
forest
whose
aggressive
loneliness
made
words
seem
trivial
bobby
was
asking
himself
again
where
he
had
stood
last
night
when
he
had
glimpsed
for
a
moment
the
straining
trees
and
the
figure
in
a
mask
which
he
had
called
his
conscience
if
he
could
only
prove
that
figure
substantial
then
graham
would
have
some
ground
for
his
suspicion
of
paredes
and
the
dancer
maria
he
glanced
at
paredes
could
there
have
been
a
conspiracy
against
him
in
the
new
york
cafe
did
paredes
in
fact
have
some
devious
purpose
in
remaining
at
the
cedars
the
automobile
took
a
sharp
curve
in
the
road
bobby
started
gazing
ahead
with
an
interest
nearly
hypnotic
the
headlights
had
caught
in
their
glare
the
deserted
farmhouse
in
which
he
had
awakened
just
before
howells
had
told
him
of
his
grandfather
death
and
practically
placed
him
under
arrest
in
the
white
light
the
frame
of
the
house
from
which
the
paint
had
flaked
appeared
ghastly
unreal
like
a
structure
seen
in
a
nightmare
from
which
one
recoils
with
morbid
horror
the
light
left
the
building
as
the
car
tore
past
bobby
could
barely
make
out
the
black
mass
in
the
midst
of
the
thicket
paredes
had
observed
it
too
i
daresay
he
remarked
casually
the
cedars
will
become
as
deserted
as
that
it
is
just
that
it
should
for
the
entire
neighbourhood
impresses
one
as
unfriendly
to
life
as
striving
through
death
to
drive
life
out
have
you
ever
seen
that
house
before
bobby
asked
quickly
i
have
never
seen
it
before
i
do
not
care
ever
to
see
it
again
it
was
a
relief
when
the
forest
thinned
and
fields
stretched
flat
and
pleasant
like
barriers
against
the
stunted
growth
bobby
stopped
the
car
in
front
of
one
of
a
group
of
houses
at
a
crossroads
he
climbed
the
steps
and
rang
doctor
groom
opened
the
door
himself
his
gigantic
hairy
figure
was
silhouetted
against
the
light
from
within
what
the
matter
now
he
demanded
in
his
gruff
voice
fortunately
i
had
gone
to
bed
i
was
reading
some
books
on
psychic
manifestations
who
sick
or
bobby
face
must
have
told
him
a
good
deal
for
he
broke
off
get
your
things
on
bobby
said
and
i
will
tell
you
as
we
drive
back
for
you
must
come
howells
has
been
killed
precisely
as
my
grandfather
was
for
a
moment
doctor
groom
bulky
frame
remained
motionless
in
the
doorway
instead
of
the
surprise
and
horror
bobby
had
foreseen
the
old
man
expressed
only
a
mute
wonder
he
got
his
hat
and
coat
and
entered
the
runabout
paredes
made
room
for
him
sitting
on
the
floor
his
feet
on
the
running
board
bobby
had
told
all
he
knew
before
they
had
reached
the
forest
the
doctor
grunted
then
the
wound
at
the
back
of
the
head
was
the
same
as
in
your
grandfather
case
exactly
then
what
good
am
i
why
am
i
routed
out
a
formality
bobby
answered
katherine
thought
if
we
got
you
quickly
you
might
do
something
anyway
she
wanted
your
advice
the
woods
closed
about
them
again
the
lights
seemed
to
push
back
a
palpable
barrier
i
ca
work
miracles
the
doctor
was
murmuring
i
ca
bring
men
back
to
life
such
a
wound
leaves
no
ground
for
hope
you
better
have
sent
for
the
police
at
once
hello
he
strained
forward
peering
around
the
windshield
funny
paredes
called
bobby
eyes
were
on
the
road
what
do
you
see
the
house
bobby
paredes
cried
no
one
to
my
certain
knowledge
the
doctor
said
has
lived
in
that
house
for
ten
years
you
say
it
was
empty
and
falling
to
pieces
when
you
woke
up
there
this
morning
bobby
knew
what
they
meant
then
and
he
reduced
the
speed
of
the
car
and
looked
ahead
to
the
right
a
pallid
glow
sifted
through
the
trees
from
the
direction
of
the
deserted
house
bobby
guided
the
car
to
the
side
of
the
road
stopped
it
and
shut
off
the
engine
at
first
no
one
moved
the
three
men
stared
as
if
in
the
presence
of
an
unaccountable
phenomenon
even
when
bobby
had
extinguished
the
headlights
the
glow
failed
to
brighten
its
pallid
quality
persisted
it
seemed
to
radiate
from
a
point
close
to
the
ground
it
comes
from
the
front
of
the
house
bobby
murmured
he
stepped
from
the
automobile
what
are
you
going
to
do
paredes
wanted
to
know
find
out
who
is
in
that
house
for
bobby
had
experienced
a
quick
hope
if
there
was
a
man
or
a
woman
secreted
in
the
building
the
truth
as
to
his
own
remarkable
presence
there
last
night
might
not
be
so
far
to
seek
after
all
there
was
moreover
something
lawless
about
this
light
escaping
from
the
place
at
such
an
hour
a
little
while
ago
when
paredes
and
he
had
driven
past
the
house
had
been
black
they
had
remarked
its
lonely
abandoned
appearance
it
had
led
paredes
to
speak
of
the
neighbourhood
as
the
domain
of
death
yet
the
strange
pallid
quality
of
the
light
itself
made
him
pause
by
the
broken
fence
it
did
come
from
the
lower
part
of
the
front
of
the
house
yet
so
faint
was
it
it
failed
to
outline
the
aperture
through
which
it
escaped
the
doctor
and
paredes
joined
him
when
i
was
here
he
said
all
the
shutters
were
closed
this
glow
is
too
white
too
diffused
we
must
see
as
he
started
forward
paredes
grasped
his
arm
there
are
too
many
of
us
we
would
make
a
noise
suppose
i
creep
up
and
investigate
there
is
one
way
in
at
the
back
bobby
told
the
doctor
let
us
go
there
we
have
whoever
inside
trapped
meantime
carlos
if
he
wishes
will
steal
up
to
the
front
he
find
out
where
the
light
comes
from
he
look
in
if
he
can
that
the
best
plan
paredes
agreed
but
they
had
scarcely
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
beyond
reach
of
the
glow
when
paredes
rejoined
them
his
feet
were
no
longer
careful
in
the
underbrush
he
came
up
running
for
the
first
time
in
their
acquaintance
bobby
detected
a
lessening
of
the
man
suave
unemotional
habit
the
light
the
panamanian
gasped
it
gone
before
i
could
get
close
it
faded
out
bobby
called
to
the
doctor
and
ran
toward
the
door
at
the
rear
it
was
unhinged
and
half
open
as
it
had
been
when
he
had
awakened
to
his
painful
and
inexplicable
predicament
he
went
through
fumbling
in
his
pocket
for
matches
the
damp
chill
of
the
hall
nauseated
him
as
it
had
done
before
seemed
to
place
about
his
throat
an
intangible
band
that
made
breathing
difficult
before
he
could
get
his
match
safe
out
the
doctor
had
struck
a
wax
vesta
its
strong
flame
played
across
the
dingy
streaked
walls
there
a
flashlight
carlos
bobby
said
in
the
door
flap
of
the
automobile
paredes
started
across
the
yard
with
a
haste
it
seemed
to
bobby
almost
eager
striking
matches
as
they
went
the
doctor
and
bobby
hurried
to
the
front
of
the
house
the
rooms
appeared
undisturbed
in
their
decay
the
shutters
were
closed
the
front
door
was
barred
the
broken
walls
from
which
the
plaster
hung
in
shreds
leered
at
them
suddenly
bobby
turned
grasping
the
doctor
arm
did
you
hear
anything
the
doctor
shook
his
head
or
feel
anything
no
i
thought
bobby
said
excitedly
that
there
was
some
one
in
the
hall
i
i
simply
got
that
impression
for
i
saw
nothing
myself
my
back
was
turned
paredes
strolled
silently
in
it
may
have
been
paredes
the
doctor
said
but
bobby
was
convinced
did
you
see
or
hear
anything
coming
through
the
hall
carlos
no
paredes
said
he
had
brought
the
light
with
its
help
they
explored
the
tiny
cellar
and
the
upper
floor
there
was
no
sign
of
a
recent
occupancy
everything
was
as
bobby
had
found
it
on
awakening
a
vagrant
wind
sighed
about
the
place
they
looked
at
each
other
with
startled
eyes
they
filed
out
with
an
incongruous
stealth
then
there
are
ghosts
here
too
paredes
whispered
who
knows
doctor
groom
mused
it
is
as
puzzling
as
anything
that
has
happened
at
the
cedars
unless
the
light
we
saw
was
some
phosphorescent
effect
of
decaying
wood
or
vegetation
then
why
should
it
go
out
all
at
once
bobby
asked
is
there
any
connection
between
this
light
and
what
has
happened
at
the
cedars
the
house
at
least
paredes
put
in
is
connected
with
what
has
happened
at
the
cedars
through
your
experience
here
at
doctor
groom
suggestion
they
sat
in
the
automobile
for
some
time
watching
the
house
for
a
repetition
of
the
pallid
light
after
several
minutes
when
it
failed
to
come
bobby
set
his
gears
graham
and
katherine
will
be
worried
they
drove
quickly
away
from
the
black
uncommunicative
mass
of
the
abandoned
building
the
woods
were
lonelier
than
before
they
impressed
bobby
as
guarding
something
he
drove
straight
to
the
stable
as
they
walked
into
the
court
they
saw
the
uncertain
candlelight
diffused
from
the
room
of
death
in
the
hall
bobby
responded
to
a
quick
alarm
the
cedars
was
too
quiet
what
had
happened
since
he
and
paredes
had
left
katherine
hartley
he
called
he
heard
running
steps
upstairs
katherine
leaned
over
the
banister
her
quiet
voice
reassured
him
is
the
doctor
with
you
he
nodded
paredes
yawned
and
lighted
a
cigarette
he
settled
himself
in
an
easy
chair
bobby
and
doctor
groom
hurried
up
katherine
led
them
down
the
old
corridor
two
chairs
had
been
placed
in
the
broken
doorway
graham
sat
there
he
arose
and
greeted
the
doctor
nothing
has
happened
since
i
left
bobby
asked
graham
shook
his
head
katherine
and
i
have
watched
every
minute
doctor
groom
walked
to
the
bed
and
for
a
long
time
looked
down
at
howells
once
he
put
out
his
hand
quickly
withdrawing
it
it
simply
a
repetition
he
said
at
last
and
his
voice
was
softer
than
its
custom
it
may
be
a
warning
for
all
we
know
that
no
one
may
sleep
in
this
room
without
attracting
death
yet
why
should
that
be
i
miss
this
poor
fellow
materialistic
viewpoint
there
nothing
i
can
do
for
him
nothing
i
can
say
except
that
death
must
have
been
instantaneous
the
police
must
seek
again
for
a
man
to
place
in
the
electric
chair
graham
touched
his
arm
with
an
odd
reluctance
sitting
here
for
so
long
i
been
thinking
i
have
always
been
materialistic
too
tell
me
seriously
doctor
do
you
believe
there
is
any
psychic
force
capable
of
killing
two
men
in
this
incisive
fashion
no
one
the
doctor
answered
can
say
what
psychic
force
is
capable
of
doing
some
scientists
have
started
to
explore
but
it
is
still
uncharted
country
from
certain
places
i
daresay
you
noticed
it
one
gets
an
impression
of
peace
and
content
from
others
a
depression
a
sense
of
suffering
i
think
we
have
all
experienced
psychic
force
to
that
extent
remember
that
this
room
has
a
history
of
intense
and
rebellious
suffering
some
of
it
i
have
seen
with
my
own
eyes
your
father
fight
for
life
katherine
was
horrible
for
those
of
us
who
knew
he
had
no
chance
as
i
watched
beside
him
i
used
to
wonder
if
such
violent
agony
could
ever
drift
wholly
into
silence
and
when
we
had
to
tell
him
finally
that
the
fight
was
lost
it
was
beyond
bearing
if
these
men
had
been
found
dead
without
marks
of
violence
graham
said
i
might
consider
such
a
possibility
irrational
as
it
seems
irrational
doctor
groom
answered
must
not
be
confused
with
impossible
the
marks
of
a
physical
violence
far
from
proving
that
the
attack
was
physical
strengthens
the
case
of
the
supernatural
certainly
you
have
heard
and
read
of
pictures
being
dashed
from
walls
by
invisible
hands
of
objects
moved
about
empty
rooms
of
cases
where
human
beings
have
been
attacked
by
inanimate
things
heavy
things
hurtling
through
the
air
some
scientists
recognize
such
irrational
possibilities
policemen
do
very
well
graham
said
stubbornly
i
follow
you
that
far
but
you
must
show
me
in
this
room
the
sharp
object
with
which
these
men
were
attacked
no
matter
what
the
force
behind
it
the
doctor
spread
his
hands
his
infused
eyes
nearly
closed
that
i
ca
do
at
any
rate
robert
this
is
wholly
tragic
to
you
i
do
see
how
any
one
could
accuse
you
of
aphasia
you
not
forgotten
bobby
said
slowly
that
you
spoke
of
a
recurrent
aphasia
that
the
trouble
graham
put
in
under
his
breath
he
has
no
more
alibi
now
than
he
had
when
his
grandfather
was
murdered
bobby
told
of
his
heavy
sleep
of
the
delay
in
katherine
arousing
him
the
doctor
gruff
voice
was
disapproving
you
should
have
drunk
that
medicine
it
had
stood
too
long
it
would
only
have
approximated
its
intended
effect
you
mean
bobby
asked
that
i
was
sleeping
as
soundly
as
i
thought
probably
not
but
you
by
no
means
a
satisfactory
victim
men
do
unaccountable
things
in
a
somnambulistic
state
but
asleep
they
wings
any
more
than
they
have
awake
you
got
to
show
us
how
you
entered
this
room
without
disturbing
the
locks
now
graham
we
must
comply
with
the
law
call
in
the
police
there
nothing
else
to
do
bobby
agreed
so
they
went
along
the
dingy
corridor
and
downstairs
from
the
depths
of
the
easy
chair
in
which
paredes
lounged
smoke
curled
with
a
lazy
indifference
the
panamanian
did
move
while
graham
and
the
doctor
walked
to
the
back
of
the
hall
to
telephone
katherine
an
anxious
figure
a
secretive
one
beckoned
bobby
to
the
library
he
went
with
her
wondering
what
she
could
want
it
was
quite
dark
in
the
library
as
bobby
fumbled
with
the
lamp
and
prepared
to
strike
a
match
he
was
aware
of
the
girl
provocatively
near
presence
he
resisted
a
warm
impulse
to
reach
out
and
touch
her
hand
he
desired
to
tell
her
all
that
was
in
his
heart
of
the
division
that
had
increased
between
them
the
last
few
months
yet
to
follow
that
impulse
would
he
realized
place
a
portion
of
his
burden
on
her
shoulders
would
also
in
a
sense
be
disloyal
to
graham
for
he
no
longer
questioned
that
the
two
had
reached
a
definite
sentimental
understanding
so
he
sighed
and
struck
the
match
even
before
the
lamp
was
lighted
katherine
was
speaking
with
a
feverish
haste
before
the
police
come
you
a
chance
bobby
the
last
chance
you
must
do
before
the
police
arrive
whatever
is
to
be
done
he
replaced
the
shade
and
glanced
at
her
astonished
by
her
intensity
by
the
forceful
gesture
with
which
she
grasped
his
arm
for
the
first
time
since
silas
blackburn
murder
all
of
her
vitality
had
come
back
to
her
what
do
you
mean
she
pointed
to
the
door
of
the
private
staircase
just
what
howells
told
you
before
he
went
up
there
to
his
death
bobby
understood
he
reacted
excitedly
to
her
attitude
of
conspirator
he
said
she
went
on
that
the
criminal
had
nothing
to
lose
that
it
would
be
to
his
advantage
to
have
him
out
of
the
way
to
destroy
that
evidence
i
thought
of
it
bobby
answered
just
before
i
went
to
sleep
do
you
see
she
said
if
you
had
killed
him
you
would
have
taken
the
cast
and
the
handkerchief
and
destroyed
them
hartley
has
told
me
everything
and
i
could
see
his
coat
for
myself
the
cast
and
the
handkerchief
are
still
in
howells
pocket
why
should
i
have
killed
him
if
not
to
destroy
those
bobby
took
her
up
with
a
quick
hope
you
did
she
cried
nothing
would
ever
make
me
believe
that
you
killed
him
but
you
will
be
charged
with
it
unless
the
evidence
disappears
you
have
no
defence
bobby
drew
back
a
little
you
want
me
to
go
there
and
and
take
from
his
pocket
those
things
she
nodded
you
remember
he
suggested
that
he
had
sent
his
report
that
may
be
there
too
bobby
shook
his
head
he
must
have
said
that
as
a
bait
at
the
worst
she
urged
a
report
without
evidence
could
only
turn
suspicion
against
you
it
would
convict
you
as
those
other
things
may
you
must
get
them
you
must
destroy
them
graham
slipped
quietly
in
and
closed
the
door
the
district
attorney
is
coming
himself
with
another
detective
he
said
i
can
guess
what
katherine
has
been
talking
about
she
right
i
a
lawyer
an
i
know
the
penalty
of
tampering
with
evidence
but
i
do
believe
you
a
murderer
and
i
tell
you
as
long
as
that
evidence
exists
they
can
convict
you
they
can
send
you
to
the
chair
they
may
arrest
you
and
try
you
anyway
on
his
report
but
i
do
believe
they
can
convict
you
on
it
alone
you
justified
in
protecting
yourself
bobby
in
the
only
way
you
can
no
one
will
see
you
go
in
the
room
arrange
it
so
that
no
one
can
testify
against
you
bobby
felt
himself
at
a
cross
roads
during
the
commission
of
those
crimes
he
had
been
unconscious
if
he
had
in
fact
had
anything
to
do
with
them
his
personality
his
real
self
had
known
nothing
had
done
no
wrong
his
body
had
merely
reacted
to
hideous
promptings
whose
source
lurked
at
the
bottom
of
the
black
pit
to
tamper
with
evidence
would
be
a
conscious
crime
all
the
more
because
of
his
doubt
of
himself
he
shrank
from
that
katherine
saw
his
hesitation
it
a
matter
of
your
life
or
death
but
although
katherine
decided
him
it
was
with
that
she
came
closer
she
looked
straight
at
him
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
an
affection
that
stirred
him
profoundly
for
my
sake
bobby
he
studied
the
dead
ashes
of
the
fire
which
a
little
while
ago
had
played
on
howells
vital
and
antagonistic
by
the
door
of
the
private
staircase
the
man
had
challenged
him
to
do
just
the
thing
from
which
he
shrank
but
howells
was
no
longer
vital
or
antagonistic
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
a
little
of
his
shrinking
arose
from
the
thought
of
approaching
and
robbing
the
still
thing
upstairs
all
that
was
left
of
the
man
who
had
not
been
afraid
of
the
mystery
of
the
locked
room
for
my
sake
katherine
repeated
bobby
squared
his
shoulders
he
fought
back
his
momentary
cowardice
the
affection
in
katherine
eyes
was
stronger
than
that
all
right
he
said
howells
never
gave
me
a
chance
while
he
was
alive
he
have
to
now
he
dead
katherine
relaxed
graham
face
was
quite
white
but
he
gave
his
instructions
in
a
cold
even
tone
we
go
to
the
hall
now
katherine
will
go
on
upstairs
she
must
see
you
enter
the
room
but
she
will
watch
in
the
corridor
while
you
are
there
to
be
sure
you
are
disturbed
you
and
i
will
chat
for
awhile
with
the
others
bobby
then
you
will
go
up
you
understand
paredes
must
even
guess
what
you
are
doing
i
keep
him
and
groom
downstairs
if
he
spied
if
he
knew
what
you
were
at
he
have
a
weapon
in
his
hands
i
hate
to
think
about
he
may
be
all
right
but
we
risk
any
more
than
we
have
to
we
must
go
on
tiptoe
he
opened
the
door
katherine
gave
bobby
hand
a
quick
encouraging
pressure
take
the
stuff
to
my
room
graham
whispered
the
first
chance
destroy
it
so
that
no
trace
will
be
left
they
went
to
the
hall
without
speaking
katherine
climbed
the
stairs
graham
drew
a
chair
between
paredes
and
the
doctor
bobby
lounged
against
the
mantel
trying
to
find
in
the
panamanian
face
some
clue
as
to
his
real
feelings
but
paredes
eyes
were
closed
his
hand
drooped
across
the
chair
arm
his
slender
pointed
fingers
held
as
if
from
mere
habit
a
lifeless
cigarette
asleep
graham
whispered
without
opening
his
eyes
paredes
spoke
no
i
feel
curiously
awake
he
yawned
doctor
groom
glanced
at
his
watch
the
powers
of
prosecution
he
grumbled
ought
to
be
here
within
the
next
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
bobby
glanced
at
graham
then
it
was
safe
to
delay
too
long
more
and
more
as
he
waited
he
shrank
from
the
invasion
of
the
room
of
death
the
prospect
of
reaching
out
and
touching
the
still
cold
thing
on
the
bed
revolted
him
was
there
anything
in
that
room
capable
of
forbidding
his
intention
was
there
in
short
a
surer
more
malicious
force
for
evil
than
his
unconscious
self
at
work
in
the
house
he
was
about
to
make
some
formal
comment
to
the
others
to
embark
on
his
distasteful
adventure
when
paredes
as
if
he
had
read
bobby
mind
opened
his
eyes
languidly
left
his
chair
and
walked
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
where
you
going
graham
asked
sharply
paredes
waved
his
hand
indifferently
and
walked
on
up
there
was
something
of
stealth
in
his
failure
to
reply
in
his
tread
on
the
stairs
graham
and
bobby
stared
after
him
unable
to
meet
this
new
situation
audibly
because
of
groom
yet
five
minutes
had
gone
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
paredes
must
rob
bobby
of
his
chance
with
a
sort
of
desperation
he
started
for
the
stairs
graham
held
out
his
hand
as
if
to
restrain
him
then
nodded
bobby
had
his
foot
on
the
first
step
when
katherine
cry
reached
them
shaping
the
moment
to
their
use
for
there
was
no
fright
in
her
cry
it
was
rather
angry
and
bobby
and
graham
ran
up
while
doctor
groom
remained
in
his
chair
an
expression
of
blank
amazement
on
his
face
a
candle
burned
on
the
table
in
the
upper
hall
katherine
and
paredes
stood
near
the
entrance
of
the
old
corridor
paredes
as
usual
was
quite
unruffled
katherine
attitude
was
defensive
she
seemed
to
hold
the
corridor
against
him
the
anger
of
her
cry
was
active
in
her
eyes
paredes
laughed
lightly
sorry
to
have
given
the
household
one
more
shock
fortunately
no
harm
done
what
is
it
katherine
graham
demanded
i
do
know
she
answered
he
startled
me
he
entered
the
corridor
paredes
nodded
quite
right
she
was
there
i
was
on
my
way
to
my
room
if
your
house
had
electricity
bobby
this
incident
would
have
been
avoided
i
saw
something
dark
in
the
corridor
you
may
not
know
graham
said
that
ever
since
we
found
howells
one
of
us
has
tried
more
or
less
to
keep
the
entrance
of
that
room
under
observation
yet
you
were
all
downstairs
a
little
while
ago
paredes
yawned
too
bad
i
might
have
taken
my
turn
then
at
any
rate
since
i
was
excluded
from
your
confidence
i
overcame
my
natural
fear
and
for
bobby
sake
slipped
in
and
i
am
afraid
startled
miss
katherine
yes
she
said
his
explanation
was
reasonable
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
but
bobby
doubt
of
his
friend
sown
by
graham
and
stimulated
by
the
incidents
of
the
last
hour
was
materially
strengthened
he
felt
a
sharp
fear
of
paredes
such
reserve
such
concealment
of
emotion
was
scarcely
human
if
graham
was
saying
you
really
want
to
help
bobby
there
is
something
you
can
do
will
you
come
downstairs
with
me
for
a
moment
like
to
suggest
one
or
two
things
before
the
police
arrive
without
hesitation
paredes
followed
graham
down
the
stairs
katherine
turned
immediately
to
bobby
her
eyes
eager
full
of
the
tense
determination
that
had
dictated
her
plan
in
the
library
now
bobby
she
whispered
and
there
no
time
to
waste
they
may
be
here
any
minute
i
wo
see
you
go
but
i
be
back
at
once
to
guard
you
against
paredes
if
he
slips
up
again
she
walked
across
the
hall
and
disappeared
in
the
newer
corridor
without
witness
he
faced
the
old
corridor
and
with
the
attempt
directly
ahead
his
repugnance
achieved
a
new
power
the
black
entrance
with
its
scarcely
dared
memories
reminded
him
that
what
he
was
about
to
do
was
directed
against
more
than
human
law
was
an
outrage
against
the
dead
man
he
had
to
remind
himself
of
the
steely
purpose
with
which
howells
had
marked
him
as
the
murderer
and
the
man
power
persisted
after
death
in
such
a
contest
he
was
justified
he
took
the
candle
from
the
table
through
the
the
murmur
of
graham
voice
occasionally
interrupted
by
groom
heavy
tones
or
the
languid
accents
of
paredes
drifted
encouragingly
trying
to
crush
his
premonitions
bobby
entered
the
corridor
instead
of
illuminating
the
narrow
passage
the
candle
seemed
half
smothered
by
its
blackness
for
the
first
time
in
his
memory
bobby
faced
the
entrance
of
the
sinister
room
alone
he
pushed
open
the
broken
door
he
paused
on
the
threshold
it
impressed
him
as
not
unnatural
that
he
should
experience
such
misgivings
they
sprang
not
alone
from
the
fact
that
within
hours
two
men
had
died
unaccountably
within
these
faded
walls
nor
did
the
evidence
pointing
to
his
own
unconscious
guilt
wholly
account
for
them
at
the
bottom
of
everything
was
the
fact
that
from
his
earliest
childhood
he
had
looked
upon
the
room
as
consecrated
to
death
had
consequently
feared
it
had
he
recalled
always
hurried
past
the
disused
corridor
leading
in
its
direction
through
its
wide
spaces
the
light
of
the
candle
scarcely
penetrated
no
more
than
an
indefinite
radiance
thrust
back
the
obscurity
and
outlined
the
bed
he
could
barely
see
the
stark
black
form
outstretched
there
the
dim
vast
room
as
he
advanced
imposed
upon
him
a
sense
of
isolation
katherine
in
the
upper
hall
the
others
downstairs
whose
voices
no
longer
reached
him
seemed
all
at
once
far
away
he
stood
in
a
place
lonelier
and
more
remote
than
the
piece
of
woods
where
he
had
momentarily
opened
his
eyes
last
night
and
instead
of
the
straining
trees
and
the
figure
in
the
black
mask
which
he
had
called
his
conscience
he
had
for
motion
and
companionship
only
the
swaying
of
the
curtains
in
the
breeze
from
the
open
window
and
the
dark
prostrate
thing
whose
face
as
he
went
closer
was
like
a
white
mask
a
mask
with
a
fixed
and
malevolent
sneer
the
wind
caught
the
flame
of
the
candle
making
it
flicker
tenuous
shadows
commenced
to
dance
across
the
walls
he
paused
with
a
tightening
throat
for
the
form
on
the
bed
seemed
moving
too
with
sly
and
scarcely
perceptible
gestures
then
he
understood
it
was
the
effect
of
the
shaking
candle
and
he
forced
himself
to
go
on
but
a
sense
of
a
multiple
companionship
accompanied
him
a
sense
of
a
shapeless
soundless
companionship
that
projected
an
idea
of
a
steady
regard
there
swept
through
his
mind
a
procession
of
figures
in
quaint
dress
and
with
faces
not
unlike
his
own
remembered
from
portraits
and
family
legends
men
and
women
to
whom
this
room
had
been
familiar
within
whose
limits
they
had
suffered
cried
out
a
agony
and
died
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
waited
for
voices
to
guide
him
to
urge
him
on
as
katherine
had
urged
him
or
to
drive
him
back
because
he
was
an
intruder
in
a
company
whose
habit
was
strange
and
terrifying
he
forced
his
glance
from
the
shadows
which
seemed
more
active
along
the
walls
he
raised
his
candle
and
stared
at
the
dead
man
the
cast
was
undoubtedly
there
the
coat
stretched
tightly
across
the
breast
outlined
it
he
stood
at
the
side
of
the
bed
he
had
only
to
bend
and
place
his
hand
in
the
pocket
which
the
cast
filled
awkwardly
the
wind
alone
he
saw
was
responsible
for
the
shaking
of
the
candle
his
hand
shook
as
the
shadows
shook
as
the
thing
on
the
bed
shook
the
sense
of
loneliness
grew
upon
him
until
it
became
complete
appalling
for
the
first
time
he
understood
that
loneliness
can
possess
a
ponderable
quality
it
was
he
felt
potent
and
active
in
the
room
a
thing
he
could
understand
or
challenge
or
overcome
his
hand
tightened
he
thought
of
katherine
guarding
the
corridor
of
paredes
and
doctor
groom
held
downstairs
by
graham
of
the
county
authorities
hurrying
to
seize
this
evidence
that
would
convict
him
and
he
realized
that
his
duty
and
his
excuse
were
clear
he
understood
that
just
now
he
had
been
captured
by
a
force
undefinable
in
terms
of
the
world
he
knew
for
a
moment
he
eluded
the
stealthy
fleshless
hands
of
its
impalpable
skirmishers
he
reached
impulsively
out
to
the
dead
man
he
was
about
to
place
his
fingers
in
the
pocket
which
after
all
was
said
and
done
held
his
life
in
the
light
of
the
candle
the
face
seemed
alive
and
more
menacing
than
it
had
ever
done
in
life
about
the
straight
smile
was
a
wider
more
triumphant
quality
the
candle
flickered
sharply
it
expired
the
conquering
blackness
took
his
breath
he
told
himself
it
was
the
draft
from
the
window
which
was
strong
but
the
companionship
of
the
night
was
closer
and
more
numerous
the
darkness
wreathed
itself
into
mocking
and
tortuous
bodies
whose
faces
were
hidden
in
an
agony
of
revolt
against
these
incorporeal
these
fanciful
horrors
he
reached
in
the
pocket
he
sprang
back
with
a
choked
inaudible
cry
for
the
dead
thing
beneath
his
hand
was
stirring
the
dead
cold
thing
with
a
languid
and
impossible
rebuke
moved
beneath
his
touch
and
the
pocket
he
had
felt
was
empty
the
coat
a
moment
ago
bulging
and
awkward
was
flat
there
sprang
to
his
mind
the
mad
thought
that
the
detective
malevolent
in
life
had
long
after
death
snatched
from
his
hand
the
evidence
carefully
gathered
on
which
everything
for
him
depended
chapter
v
the
crying
through
the
woods
bobby
inability
to
cry
out
alone
prevented
his
alarming
the
others
and
announcing
to
paredes
and
doctor
groom
his
unlawful
presence
in
the
room
during
the
moment
that
the
shock
held
him
silent
motionless
bent
in
the
darkness
above
the
bed
he
understood
there
could
have
been
no
ambiguity
about
his
ghastly
and
loathsome
experience
the
dead
detective
had
altered
his
position
as
silas
blackburn
had
done
and
this
time
someone
had
been
in
the
room
and
suffered
the
appalling
change
fingers
still
responded
to
the
charnel
feeling
of
cold
inactive
flesh
suddenly
become
alive
and
potent
beneath
his
touch
and
a
reason
for
the
apparent
miracle
offered
itself
between
the
extinction
of
his
candle
and
the
commencement
of
that
movement
only
a
second
or
so
the
evidence
had
disappeared
from
the
detective
pocket
bobby
relaxed
he
stumbled
across
the
room
and
into
the
corridor
he
went
with
hands
outstretched
through
the
blackness
for
no
candle
burned
in
the
upper
hall
but
he
knew
that
katherine
was
on
guard
there
when
he
left
the
passage
he
saw
her
an
unnatural
figure
herself
in
the
yellowish
unhealthy
twilight
which
sifted
through
the
stair
well
from
the
lamp
in
the
hall
below
she
must
have
sensed
something
out
of
the
way
immediately
for
she
hurried
to
meet
him
and
her
whisper
held
no
assurance
you
got
the
cast
and
the
handkerchief
bobby
and
when
he
did
answer
at
once
she
asked
with
a
sharp
rush
of
fear
what
the
matter
what
happened
he
shuddered
at
last
he
managed
to
speak
katherine
i
have
felt
death
cease
to
be
death
later
he
was
to
recall
that
phrase
with
a
sicker
horror
than
he
experienced
now
you
saw
something
she
said
but
your
candle
is
out
there
is
no
light
in
the
room
he
took
her
hand
he
pressed
it
you
real
he
said
with
a
nervous
laugh
something
i
can
understand
everything
is
unreal
this
light
he
strode
to
the
table
found
a
match
and
lighted
his
candle
katherine
as
she
saw
his
face
drew
back
bobby
my
candle
went
out
he
said
dully
and
he
moved
through
the
darkness
i
tell
you
he
moved
beneath
my
hand
she
drew
farther
away
staring
at
him
you
were
frightened
no
if
we
go
there
with
a
light
now
he
said
with
the
same
dull
conviction
we
will
find
him
as
we
found
my
grandfather
this
afternoon
the
monotonous
voices
of
the
three
men
in
the
lower
hall
weaved
a
background
for
their
whispers
the
normal
familiar
sound
was
like
a
tonic
bobby
straightened
katherine
threw
off
the
spell
of
his
announcement
but
the
evidence
you
got
she
stared
at
his
empty
hands
he
fancied
that
he
saw
contempt
in
her
eyes
in
spite
of
everything
you
must
go
back
you
must
get
that
even
if
i
had
the
courage
he
said
wearily
it
would
be
no
use
for
the
evidence
is
gone
but
i
saw
it
at
least
i
saw
his
pocket
it
was
there
he
answered
when
my
light
went
out
i
did
put
my
hand
in
his
pocket
in
that
second
it
had
gone
there
was
no
one
there
she
said
no
one
but
you
because
i
watched
he
leaned
heavily
against
the
wall
good
god
katherine
it
too
big
whatever
it
is
we
ca
fight
it
she
looked
for
some
time
down
the
corridor
at
the
black
entrance
of
the
sinister
room
at
last
she
turned
and
walked
to
the
banister
she
called
hartley
will
you
come
up
bobby
wondered
at
the
steadiness
of
her
voice
the
murmuring
below
ceased
graham
ran
up
the
stairs
her
summons
had
been
warning
enough
their
attitudes
as
graham
reached
the
upper
hall
were
eloquent
of
bobby
failure
you
did
get
the
cast
and
the
handkerchief
he
said
bobby
told
briefly
what
had
happened
what
is
one
to
do
he
ended
even
the
dead
are
against
me
it
beyond
belief
graham
said
roughly
he
snatched
up
the
candle
and
entered
the
corridor
uncertainly
katherine
and
bobby
followed
him
he
went
straight
to
the
bed
and
thrust
the
candle
beneath
the
canopy
the
others
could
see
from
the
door
the
change
that
had
taken
place
the
body
of
howells
was
turned
awkwardly
on
its
side
the
coat
pocket
was
as
bobby
had
described
it
flat
and
empty
katherine
turned
and
went
back
to
the
hall
graham
hand
shook
as
bobby
had
shaken
no
tricks
bobby
bobby
could
resent
the
suspicion
which
appeared
to
offer
the
only
explanation
of
what
had
happened
the
candle
flickered
in
the
draft
look
out
bobby
warned
the
misshapen
shadows
danced
with
a
multiple
vivacity
across
the
walls
graham
shaded
the
candle
flame
and
the
shadows
became
like
morbid
decorations
gargantuan
and
motionless
it
madness
graham
said
there
no
explanation
of
this
that
we
can
understand
howells
straight
smile
mocked
them
as
if
in
answer
to
graham
a
voice
sighed
through
the
room
its
quality
was
one
with
the
shadows
unsubstantial
and
shapeless
bobby
grasped
one
of
the
bed
posts
and
braced
himself
listening
the
candle
in
graham
hand
commenced
to
flicker
again
and
bobby
knew
that
it
had
been
his
fancy
for
graham
listened
too
it
shook
again
through
the
heavy
oppressive
night
merely
accentuated
by
the
candle
a
faint
ululation
barely
detaching
itself
from
silence
straying
after
a
time
into
the
silence
again
at
first
it
was
like
the
grief
of
a
woman
heard
at
a
great
distance
but
the
sound
while
it
gained
no
strength
forced
on
them
more
and
more
an
abhorrent
sense
of
intimacy
this
crying
from
an
infinite
distance
filled
the
room
seemed
finally
to
have
its
source
in
the
room
itself
after
it
had
sobbed
thinly
into
nothing
its
pulsations
continued
to
sigh
in
bobby
ears
they
seemed
timed
to
the
renewed
and
eccentric
dancing
of
the
amorphous
shadows
graham
straightened
and
placed
the
candle
on
the
bureau
he
seemed
more
startled
than
he
had
been
at
the
unbelievable
secretiveness
of
a
dead
man
you
heard
it
bobby
breathed
graham
nodded
what
was
it
where
did
you
think
it
came
from
bobby
demanded
it
was
like
someone
mourning
for
this
this
poor
devil
graham
could
disguise
his
effort
to
elude
the
sombre
spell
of
the
room
to
drive
from
his
brain
the
illusion
of
that
unearthly
moaning
it
must
have
come
from
outside
the
house
he
answered
there
no
use
giving
way
to
fancies
where
there
a
possible
explanation
it
must
have
come
from
outside
from
some
woman
in
great
agony
of
mind
bobby
recalled
his
perception
of
a
woman
moving
with
a
curious
absence
of
sound
about
the
edges
of
the
stagnant
lake
he
spoke
of
it
to
graham
i
could
be
sure
it
was
a
woman
but
there
no
house
within
two
miles
what
would
a
woman
be
doing
wandering
around
the
cedars
at
any
rate
there
are
three
women
in
the
house
graham
said
katherine
and
the
two
servants
ella
and
jane
the
maids
are
badly
frightened
it
may
have
come
from
the
servants
quarters
it
must
have
been
one
of
them
but
bobby
saw
that
graham
did
believe
either
of
the
maids
had
released
that
poignant
suffering
it
did
sound
like
a
living
voice
he
said
simply
then
how
are
we
to
take
it
graham
persisted
angrily
i
shall
question
katherine
and
the
two
maids
he
took
up
the
candle
with
a
stubborn
effort
to
recapture
his
old
forcefulness
but
as
they
left
the
room
the
shadows
thronged
thickly
after
them
in
ominous
pursuit
and
it
was
necessary
to
question
katherine
she
stood
in
the
corridor
her
lips
parted
her
face
white
and
shocked
what
was
it
she
said
that
nearly
silent
grief
she
put
her
hands
to
her
ears
lowering
them
helplessly
after
a
moment
where
did
you
think
it
came
from
graham
asked
from
a
long
ways
off
she
answered
then
i
i
thought
it
must
be
in
the
room
with
you
and
i
wondered
if
you
saw
graham
shook
his
head
we
saw
nothing
it
was
probably
ella
or
jane
they
been
badly
frightened
perhaps
a
nightmare
or
they
heard
us
moving
around
the
front
part
of
the
house
i
am
going
to
see
katherine
and
bobby
followed
him
downstairs
doctor
groom
and
paredes
stood
in
front
of
the
fireplace
questioningly
looking
upward
paredes
did
speak
at
first
but
doctor
groom
burst
out
in
his
grumbling
bass
voice
what
been
going
on
up
there
did
you
hear
just
now
a
queer
crying
graham
asked
no
you
paredes
i
heard
nothing
paredes
answered
except
doctor
disquieting
theories
it
an
uncanny
hour
for
such
talk
what
kind
of
a
cry
may
i
ask
like
a
woman
moaning
bobby
said
and
doctor
howells
has
changed
his
position
what
are
you
talking
about
the
doctor
cried
he
has
turned
on
his
side
as
blackburn
did
graham
told
him
paredes
glanced
at
bobby
and
how
was
this
new
mystery
discovered
bobby
caught
the
implication
then
the
panamanian
clung
to
his
slyly
expressed
doubt
of
katherine
which
might
after
all
have
had
its
impulse
in
an
instinct
of
bobby
knew
that
graham
and
katherine
would
guard
the
fashion
in
which
the
startling
discovery
had
been
made
before
he
could
speak
for
himself
indeed
graham
was
answering
paredes
this
crying
seemed
after
a
time
to
come
from
the
room
we
entered
but
miss
katherine
called
you
up
paredes
said
i
supposed
she
had
heard
again
movements
in
the
room
bobby
managed
a
smile
you
see
carlos
nothing
is
consistent
in
this
case
paredes
bowed
gravely
it
is
very
curious
a
woman
should
cry
about
the
house
the
servants
may
make
it
seem
natural
enough
graham
said
will
you
come
bobby
as
they
crossed
the
dining
room
they
heard
a
stirring
in
the
kitchen
graham
threw
open
the
door
jenkins
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
old
butler
had
lighted
a
candle
and
placed
it
on
the
mantel
the
disorder
of
his
clothing
suggested
the
haste
with
which
he
had
left
his
bed
and
come
downstairs
his
wrinkled
sunken
face
had
aged
perceptibly
he
advanced
with
an
expression
of
obvious
relief
i
was
just
coming
to
find
you
mr
robert
what
up
bobby
asked
a
little
while
ago
i
thought
you
were
all
asleep
back
here
one
of
the
women
awakened
him
graham
said
it
just
as
i
thought
was
that
it
the
old
butler
asked
with
a
quick
relief
but
immediately
he
shook
his
head
it
could
have
been
that
graham
for
i
stopped
at
ella
and
jane
doors
and
there
was
no
sound
they
seemed
to
be
asleep
and
it
was
like
that
you
mean
bobby
said
that
you
heard
a
woman
crying
jenkins
nodded
it
woke
me
up
if
you
did
think
it
was
one
of
the
maids
graham
asked
what
did
you
make
of
it
i
thought
it
came
from
outside
i
thought
it
was
a
woman
prowling
around
the
house
then
i
said
to
myself
why
should
a
woman
prowl
around
the
cedars
and
it
was
too
unearthly
sir
and
i
remembered
the
way
silas
was
murdered
and
the
awful
thing
that
happened
to
his
body
this
afternoon
and
i
you
wo
think
me
foolish
sirs
i
doubted
if
it
was
a
human
voice
i
had
heard
no
graham
said
dryly
we
wo
think
you
foolish
so
i
thought
i
better
wake
you
up
and
tell
you
graham
turned
to
bobby
katherine
and
you
and
i
he
said
fancied
the
crying
was
in
the
room
with
us
jenkins
is
sure
it
came
from
outside
the
house
that
is
significant
wherever
it
came
from
bobby
said
softly
it
was
like
some
one
mourning
for
howells
jenkins
started
the
policeman
bobby
remembered
that
jenkins
had
been
aroused
by
the
discovery
of
howells
murder
you
know
in
a
few
minutes
anyway
he
said
howells
has
been
killed
as
my
grandfather
was
jenkins
moved
back
a
look
of
unbelief
and
awe
in
his
wrinkled
face
he
boasted
he
was
going
to
sleep
in
that
room
he
whispered
bobby
studied
jenkins
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
the
old
man
for
into
the
awe
of
the
wrinkled
face
had
stolen
a
positive
relief
an
emotion
that
bordered
on
the
triumphant
it
terrible
jenkins
whispered
graham
grasped
his
shoulder
what
the
matter
with
you
jenkins
one
would
say
you
were
glad
no
oh
no
sir
it
is
terrible
i
was
only
wondering
about
the
policeman
report
what
do
you
know
about
his
report
bobby
cried
only
that
that
he
gave
it
to
me
to
mail
just
before
he
went
up
to
the
old
room
you
mailed
it
graham
snapped
jenkins
hesitated
when
he
answered
his
voice
was
i
an
old
coward
robert
the
policeman
told
me
the
letter
was
very
important
and
if
anything
happened
to
it
i
would
get
in
trouble
he
could
afford
to
leave
the
house
himself
he
said
but
as
i
say
i
a
coward
and
i
did
want
to
walk
through
the
woods
to
the
box
by
the
gate
i
figured
it
all
out
it
would
be
taken
up
until
early
in
the
morning
and
if
i
waited
until
daylight
it
would
only
be
delayed
one
collection
so
i
made
up
my
mind
i
sleep
on
it
because
i
knew
he
had
it
in
for
you
robert
i
supposed
i
mail
it
in
the
morning
but
i
decided
i
think
it
over
anyway
and
not
harrow
myself
walking
through
the
woods
you
done
a
good
job
graham
said
excitedly
where
is
the
report
now
in
my
room
shall
i
fetch
it
sir
graham
nodded
and
jenkins
shuffled
up
the
stairs
what
luck
graham
said
howells
must
have
telephoned
his
suspicions
to
the
district
attorney
he
must
have
mentioned
the
evidence
but
what
does
that
amount
to
since
it
disappeared
along
with
the
duplicate
of
the
report
if
howells
made
one
i
can
fight
with
a
clear
conscience
bobby
cried
i
was
asleep
when
howells
body
altered
its
position
do
you
realize
what
that
means
to
me
for
once
i
was
wide
awake
when
the
old
room
was
at
its
tricks
if
howells
were
alive
graham
answered
shortly
he
would
look
on
the
fact
that
you
were
awake
and
alone
with
the
body
as
the
worst
possible
evidence
against
you
bobby
elation
died
there
is
always
something
to
tangle
me
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
with
these
mysteries
but
i
know
and
i
fight
can
you
find
any
trace
of
a
conspiracy
against
me
in
this
last
ghastly
adventure
it
complicates
everything
graham
admitted
it
beyond
sounding
bobby
said
for
my
grandfather
death
last
night
and
the
disturbance
of
his
body
this
afternoon
seemed
calculated
to
condemn
me
absolutely
yet
howells
murder
and
the
movement
of
his
body
with
the
disappearance
of
the
cast
and
the
handkerchief
seem
designed
to
save
me
are
there
two
influences
at
work
in
this
house
one
for
me
one
against
me
let
think
of
the
human
elements
graham
answered
with
a
frown
i
have
no
faith
in
paredes
my
man
has
failed
to
report
on
maria
queer
you
fancy
a
woman
in
black
slipping
through
the
woods
and
we
hear
a
woman
cry
i
want
to
account
for
those
things
before
i
give
in
to
groom
spirits
i
confess
at
times
they
seem
the
only
logical
explanation
here
jenkins
if
trouble
comes
of
his
withholding
the
report
i
take
the
blame
bobby
said
graham
snatched
the
long
envelope
from
jenkins
hand
it
was
addressed
in
a
firm
hand
to
the
district
attorney
at
the
county
seat
there
no
question
graham
said
that
it
we
must
open
it
better
not
destroy
it
put
it
where
it
wo
be
easily
found
jenkins
if
you
are
questioned
you
have
no
recollection
of
howells
having
given
it
to
you
blackburn
promises
he
will
see
you
get
in
no
trouble
the
old
man
smiled
trouble
he
scoffed
blackburn
need
fret
himself
about
me
the
last
of
this
family
that
is
miss
katherine
and
he
i
old
and
about
done
for
i
do
mind
trouble
not
a
bit
sir
bobby
pressed
his
hand
his
voice
was
a
little
husky
i
did
think
you
go
that
far
in
my
service
jenkins
the
old
butler
smiled
slyly
i
go
a
lot
further
than
that
sir
we
better
get
back
graham
said
the
blood
hounds
ought
to
be
here
and
they
sniff
at
the
case
harder
than
ever
because
it
done
for
howells
they
watched
jenkins
go
upstairs
with
the
report
we
taking
long
chances
graham
said
desperately
long
chances
but
you
in
a
desperately
dangerous
position
it
the
only
way
you
be
accused
of
stealing
the
evidence
but
remember
when
they
question
you
they
can
prove
nothing
unless
the
cast
and
the
handkerchief
turn
up
if
they
been
taken
by
an
enemy
in
some
magical
fashion
to
be
produced
at
the
proper
moment
there
no
hope
meantime
play
the
game
and
katherine
and
i
will
help
you
all
we
can
the
doctor
too
is
friendly
there
no
doubt
of
him
come
now
let
face
the
music
bobby
followed
graham
to
the
hall
trying
to
strengthen
his
nerves
for
the
ordeal
even
now
he
was
more
appalled
by
the
apparently
supernatural
background
of
the
case
than
he
was
by
the
material
details
which
pointed
to
his
guilt
more
than
the
report
and
the
cast
and
the
handkerchief
the
remembrance
of
that
impossible
moment
in
the
blackness
of
the
old
room
filled
his
mind
and
the
unearthly
and
remote
crying
still
throbbed
in
his
ears
katherine
graham
and
the
doctor
waited
by
the
fireplace
they
had
heard
nothing
from
the
authorities
but
they
must
be
here
soon
doctor
groom
said
did
you
learn
anything
back
there
hartley
katherine
asked
it
was
the
servants
he
said
jenkins
heard
the
crying
certain
it
came
from
outside
the
house
paredes
looked
up
extraordinary
he
said
i
wish
i
had
heard
it
doctor
groom
grumbled
paredes
laughed
thank
the
good
lord
i
did
perpetually
bobby
your
house
reminds
me
that
i
nerves
sensitive
to
the
unknown
world
i
will
go
further
than
the
doctor
i
will
say
that
this
house
crowded
with
the
supernatural
it
shelters
things
that
we
can
not
understand
that
we
will
never
understand
when
i
was
a
child
in
panama
i
had
a
nurse
who
unfortunately
developed
too
strongly
my
native
superstition
how
she
frightened
me
with
her
bedtime
stories
they
were
all
of
men
murdered
or
dead
of
fevers
crossing
the
trail
or
building
the
railroad
or
digging
insufficient
ditches
for
de
lesseps
some
of
her
best
went
farther
back
than
that
they
were
thick
with
the
ghosts
of
old
spaniards
and
the
crimson
hands
of
morgan
buccaneers
really
that
tiny
strip
across
the
isthmus
is
crowded
with
souls
snatched
too
quickly
from
torn
and
tortured
bodies
if
you
are
sensitive
you
feel
they
are
still
there
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
the
cedars
doctor
groom
grumbled
it
explains
my
ability
to
sense
strange
elements
in
this
old
house
there
are
in
panama
if
you
do
mind
doctor
improvised
graveyards
tangled
by
the
jungle
that
give
you
a
feeling
of
an
active
unseen
population
precisely
as
this
house
does
he
arose
and
strolled
with
a
lack
of
sound
about
the
hall
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
was
scarcely
audible
it
was
the
voice
of
a
man
who
thinks
aloud
and
the
doctor
failed
to
interrupt
him
again
i
have
felt
less
spiritually
alarmed
in
those
places
of
grinning
skulls
which
always
seem
trying
to
recite
agonies
beyond
expression
than
i
feel
in
this
house
for
here
the
woods
are
more
desolate
than
the
jungle
and
the
walls
of
houses
as
old
as
this
make
a
prison
for
suffering
a
vague
discomfort
stole
through
bobby
surprise
he
had
never
heard
paredes
speak
so
seriously
in
spite
of
the
man
unruffled
manner
there
was
nothing
of
mockery
about
his
words
what
then
was
their
intention
paredes
said
no
more
but
for
several
minutes
he
paced
up
and
down
the
hall
glancing
often
with
languid
eyes
toward
the
stairs
he
had
the
appearance
of
one
who
expects
and
waits
katherine
graham
and
the
doctor
bobby
could
see
had
been
made
as
uneasy
as
himself
by
the
change
in
the
panamanian
the
doctor
cleared
his
throat
his
voice
broke
the
silence
tentatively
if
this
house
makes
you
so
unhappy
young
man
why
do
you
stay
paredes
paused
in
his
walk
his
thin
lips
twitched
he
indicated
bobby
for
the
sake
of
my
very
good
friend
what
are
a
man
personal
fears
and
desires
if
he
can
help
his
friends
graham
distaste
was
evident
paredes
recognized
it
with
a
smile
bobby
watched
him
curiously
realizing
more
and
more
that
graham
was
right
to
this
extent
they
must
somehow
learn
the
real
purpose
of
the
panamanian
continued
presence
here
paredes
resumed
his
walk
he
still
had
that
air
of
expectancy
he
seemed
to
listen
this
feeling
of
imminence
reached
bobby
increased
his
restlessness
he
thought
he
heard
an
automobile
horn
outside
he
sprang
up
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
stood
gazing
through
the
damp
and
narrow
court
yet
he
confessed
he
listened
for
a
repetition
of
that
unearthly
crying
through
the
thicket
rather
than
for
the
approach
of
those
who
would
try
to
condemn
him
for
two
murders
paredes
was
right
the
place
was
unhealthy
its
dark
walls
seemed
to
draw
closer
they
had
a
desolate
and
unfriendly
secretiveness
they
might
hide
anything
the
whirring
of
a
motor
reached
him
headlights
flung
gigantic
distorted
shadows
of
trees
across
the
walls
of
the
old
wing
bobby
faced
the
others
they
coming
he
said
and
his
voice
was
sufficiently
apprehensive
now
graham
joined
him
at
the
door
yes
he
said
there
will
be
another
inquisition
you
all
know
that
howells
for
some
absurd
reason
suspected
bobby
bobby
it
goes
without
saying
knows
no
more
about
the
crimes
than
any
of
us
i
dare
say
you
keep
that
in
mind
if
they
try
to
confuse
you
after
all
there
very
little
any
of
us
can
tell
them
except
paredes
said
with
a
yawn
what
went
on
upstairs
when
the
woman
cried
and
howells
body
moved
of
course
i
know
nothing
about
that
graham
glanced
at
him
sharply
i
do
know
what
you
mean
but
you
have
told
us
all
that
you
are
bobby
friend
quite
so
and
i
am
not
a
spy
he
moved
his
head
in
his
grave
and
dignified
bow
the
automobile
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
the
court
three
men
stepped
out
and
hurried
up
the
path
as
they
entered
the
hall
bobby
recognized
the
sallow
wizened
features
of
the
coroner
one
of
the
others
was
short
and
thick
set
his
round
and
florid
face
one
felt
should
have
expressed
friendliness
and
rather
than
the
intolerant
anger
that
marked
it
now
the
third
was
a
lank
man
whose
sharp
face
released
more
determination
than
intelligence
i
am
robinson
the
district
attorney
the
stout
one
announced
and
this
is
jack
rawlins
the
best
detective
i
got
now
that
howells
is
gone
jack
was
a
close
friend
of
howells
so
he
make
a
good
job
of
it
but
i
thought
it
was
time
i
came
myself
to
see
what
the
devil
going
on
in
this
house
the
lank
man
nodded
you
right
robinson
there
be
no
more
nonsense
about
the
case
if
howells
had
made
an
arrest
he
might
be
alive
this
minute
bobby
heart
sank
these
men
would
act
from
a
primary
instinct
of
revenge
they
wanted
the
man
who
had
killed
silas
blackburn
principally
because
it
was
certain
he
had
also
killed
their
friend
rawlins
words
moreover
suggested
that
howells
must
have
telephoned
a
pretty
clear
outline
of
the
case
robinson
stared
at
them
insolently
this
is
doctor
groom
i
know
which
is
young
mr
blackburn
bobby
stepped
forward
the
sharp
eyes
surrounded
by
puffy
flesh
studied
him
aggressively
bobby
forced
himself
to
meet
that
unfriendly
gaze
would
robinson
accuse
him
now
before
he
had
gone
into
the
case
for
himself
at
least
he
could
prove
nothing
after
a
moment
the
man
turned
away
who
is
this
he
asked
indicating
graham
a
very
good
friend
my
lawyer
graham
bobby
answered
robinson
walked
over
to
paredes
another
lawyer
he
sneered
another
friend
paredes
answered
easily
robinson
glanced
at
katherine
of
course
you
are
miss
perrine
good
coroner
these
are
all
that
were
in
the
front
part
of
the
house
when
you
were
here
before
the
same
lot
the
coroner
squeaked
there
are
three
servants
a
man
and
two
women
robinson
went
on
account
for
them
rawlins
and
see
what
they
have
to
say
come
upstairs
when
you
through
all
right
coroner
but
he
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
for
the
present
no
one
will
leave
the
house
without
my
permission
if
you
care
to
come
upstairs
with
me
blackburn
you
might
be
useful
bobby
shrank
from
the
thought
of
returning
to
the
old
room
even
with
this
determined
company
he
did
hesitate
however
for
robinson
purpose
was
clear
he
wanted
bobby
where
he
could
watch
him
graham
prepared
to
accompany
them
if
you
need
me
the
doctor
said
i
looked
at
the
body
oh
yes
robinson
sneered
i
like
to
know
exactly
what
time
you
found
the
body
graham
flushed
but
katherine
answered
easily
about
two
the
hour
at
which
blackburn
was
killed
and
i
robinson
sneered
was
aroused
at
an
hour
during
which
the
police
were
left
out
of
the
case
we
thought
it
wise
to
get
a
physician
first
of
all
graham
said
you
knew
howells
never
had
a
chance
you
knew
he
had
been
murdered
the
moment
you
looked
at
him
robinson
burst
out
we
acted
for
the
best
graham
answered
his
manner
impressed
silence
on
katherine
and
bobby
we
see
about
that
later
robinson
said
with
a
clear
threat
if
it
does
inconvenience
you
too
much
we
go
up
now
in
the
upper
hall
he
snatched
the
candle
from
the
table
which
way
katherine
nodded
to
the
old
corridor
and
slipped
to
her
room
robinson
stepped
forward
with
the
coroner
at
his
heels
bobby
graham
and
the
doctor
followed
inside
the
narrow
choking
passage
bobby
saw
the
district
attorney
hesitate
what
the
matter
the
doctor
rumbled
the
district
attorney
went
on
without
answering
he
glanced
at
the
broken
lock
so
you
had
to
smash
your
way
in
he
walked
to
the
bed
and
looked
down
at
howells
poor
devil
he
murmured
howells
was
the
man
to
get
caught
unawares
it
beyond
me
how
any
one
could
have
come
close
enough
to
make
that
wound
without
putting
him
on
his
guard
it
beyond
us
as
it
was
beyond
him
graham
answered
how
any
one
got
into
the
room
at
all
in
response
to
robinson
questions
he
told
in
detail
about
the
discovery
of
both
murders
robinson
pondered
for
some
time
then
you
and
blackburn
were
asleep
he
said
miss
perrine
aroused
you
this
foreigner
paredes
was
awake
and
dressed
and
in
the
lower
hall
i
think
he
was
in
the
court
as
we
went
by
the
graham
corrected
him
i
shall
want
to
talk
to
your
foreigner
robinson
said
he
shivered
this
room
is
like
a
charnel
house
why
did
howells
want
to
sleep
here
i
do
think
he
intended
to
sleep
graham
said
from
the
start
howells
was
bound
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
entrance
of
the
room
he
came
here
hoping
that
the
criminal
would
make
just
such
an
attempt
as
he
did
he
was
confident
he
could
take
care
of
himself
get
his
man
and
clear
up
the
last
details
of
the
case
robinson
looked
straight
at
bobby
then
howells
knew
the
criminal
was
in
the
house
howells
i
daresay
graham
said
telephoned
you
something
of
his
suspicions
robinson
nodded
he
was
on
the
wrong
line
graham
argued
or
he
would
have
been
so
easily
overcome
you
can
see
for
yourself
locked
doors
a
wound
that
suggests
the
assailant
was
close
to
him
yet
he
must
have
been
awake
and
watchful
and
if
there
had
been
a
physical
attack
before
the
sharp
instrument
was
driven
into
his
brain
he
would
have
cried
out
yet
miss
perrine
was
aroused
by
nothing
of
the
sort
and
the
coroner
i
daresay
will
find
no
marks
of
a
struggle
about
the
body
the
coroner
who
had
been
busy
at
the
bed
glanced
up
no
mark
at
all
if
howells
was
asleep
his
murderer
must
have
been
invisible
as
well
as
noiseless
doctor
groom
smiled
the
coroner
glared
at
him
i
suggest
district
attorney
he
squeaked
that
the
ordinary
layman
would
know
that
this
type
of
wound
would
cause
immediate
death
nor
would
any
man
the
doctor
answered
angrily
be
able
to
make
such
a
wound
with
his
victim
lying
on
his
back
on
his
back
robinson
echoed
but
he
is
on
his
back
the
doctor
told
of
the
amazing
alteration
in
the
positions
of
both
victims
bobby
regretted
with
all
his
heart
that
he
had
made
the
attempt
to
get
the
evidence
already
complete
frankness
was
impossible
for
him
already
a
feeling
of
guilt
sprang
from
the
necessity
of
withholding
the
testimony
which
he
alone
could
give
and
a
woman
cried
robinson
said
bewildered
all
this
sounds
like
a
ghost
story
you
more
sense
than
i
thought
doctor
groom
said
dryly
i
never
could
get
howells
to
see
it
that
way
what
are
you
driving
at
robinson
snapped
these
crimes
the
doctor
answered
have
all
the
elements
of
a
ghostly
impulse
robinson
laugh
was
a
little
uncomfortable
the
cedars
is
a
nice
place
for
spooks
but
it
wo
do
i
be
frank
howells
telephoned
me
he
had
found
plenty
of
evidence
of
human
interference
it
evident
in
both
cases
that
the
murderer
came
back
and
disturbed
the
bodies
for
some
special
purpose
i
do
know
what
it
was
the
first
time
but
it
simple
to
understand
the
last
the
murderer
came
for
evidence
howells
had
on
his
person
bobby
could
meet
the
sharp
puffy
eyes
he
alone
was
capable
of
testifying
that
the
evidence
had
been
removed
as
if
to
secrete
it
from
his
unlawful
hand
yet
if
he
spoke
he
would
prove
the
district
point
he
would
condemn
himself
curious
graham
said
slowly
that
the
murderer
did
take
the
evidence
when
he
killed
his
man
i
do
know
about
that
robinson
said
but
i
know
howells
had
evidence
on
his
person
you
through
coroner
then
we
have
a
look
although
it
little
use
he
walked
to
the
bed
and
searched
howells
pockets
just
as
i
thought
nothing
he
told
me
he
was
preparing
a
report
if
he
did
mail
it
that
was
stolen
with
the
rest
of
the
stuff
right
he
waited
too
long
to
make
his
arrest
again
bobby
wondered
if
the
man
would
bring
matters
to
a
head
now
he
could
appreciate
however
that
robinson
with
nothing
to
go
on
but
howells
telephoned
suspicions
might
spoil
his
chances
of
a
solution
by
acting
too
hastily
rawlins
strolled
in
the
two
women
were
asleep
he
said
the
old
man
knows
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
he
heard
a
woman
crying
outside
a
little
while
ago
i
do
think
we
need
bother
about
the
back
part
of
the
house
for
the
present
robinson
said
howells
evidence
has
been
stolen
it
your
job
to
find
it
unless
it
been
destroyed
your
other
job
is
to
discover
the
instrument
that
caused
death
in
both
cases
then
maybe
our
worthy
doctor
will
desert
his
ghosts
blackburn
if
you
will
come
with
me
there
a
slight
possibility
of
checking
up
some
of
the
evidence
of
which
howells
spoke
our
fine
fellow
may
have
made
a
slip
in
the
court
bobby
understood
and
was
afraid
more
afraid
than
he
had
been
at
any
time
since
he
had
overheard
howells
catalogue
his
case
to
graham
in
the
library
why
even
in
so
much
confusion
had
graham
and
he
failed
to
think
of
those
marks
in
the
court
they
had
been
intact
when
he
had
stood
there
just
before
dark
it
was
unlikely
any
one
had
walked
across
the
grass
since
he
saw
graham
elaborate
precautions
demolished
the
case
against
him
stronger
than
it
had
been
before
howells
murder
graham
face
revealed
the
same
helpless
comprehension
they
followed
robinson
downstairs
graham
made
a
gesture
of
surrender
bobby
glanced
at
paredes
who
alone
had
remained
below
the
panamanian
smoked
and
lounged
in
the
easy
chair
his
eyes
seemed
restless
i
shall
wish
to
ask
you
some
questions
in
a
few
minutes
paredes
the
district
attorney
said
at
your
service
i
sure
paredes
drawled
he
watched
them
until
they
had
entered
the
court
and
closed
the
door
the
chill
dampness
of
the
court
infected
bobby
as
it
had
always
done
it
was
a
proper
setting
for
his
accusation
and
arrest
for
robinson
he
knew
would
wait
as
howells
had
done
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
locked
doors
robinson
while
the
others
grouped
themselves
about
him
took
a
flashlight
from
his
pocket
and
pressed
the
control
the
brilliant
cylinder
of
light
illuminated
the
grass
making
it
seem
unnaturally
green
bobby
braced
himself
for
the
inevitable
denouement
then
while
robinson
exclaimed
angrily
his
eyes
widened
his
heart
beat
rapidly
with
a
vast
and
wondering
relief
for
the
marks
he
remembered
so
clearly
had
been
obliterated
with
painstaking
thoroughness
and
at
first
the
slate
seemed
perfectly
clean
he
was
sure
his
unknown
friend
had
avoided
leaving
any
trace
of
his
own
each
step
in
the
grass
had
been
carefully
scraped
out
in
the
confusion
of
the
path
there
was
nothing
to
be
learned
the
genuine
surprise
of
bobby
exclamation
turned
robinson
to
him
with
a
look
of
doubt
you
acknowledge
these
footmarks
were
here
mr
blackburn
certainly
bobby
answered
i
saw
them
myself
just
before
dark
i
knew
howells
ridiculously
connected
them
with
the
murderer
you
made
a
good
job
of
it
when
you
trampled
them
out
robinson
hazarded
but
it
was
clear
bobby
amazement
had
not
been
lost
on
him
or
he
went
on
this
foreigner
who
advertises
himself
as
your
friend
he
was
in
the
court
tonight
we
know
that
suddenly
he
stooped
and
bobby
got
on
his
knees
beside
him
the
cylinder
of
light
held
in
its
centre
one
mark
clear
and
distinct
in
the
trampled
grass
and
with
a
warm
gratitude
a
swift
apprehension
bobby
thought
of
katherine
for
the
mark
in
the
grass
had
been
made
by
the
heel
of
a
woman
shoe
not
the
foreigner
then
robinson
mused
not
yourself
blackburn
but
a
woman
a
devoted
woman
that
something
to
get
after
and
if
she
lies
the
impression
of
the
heel
will
give
her
away
the
coroner
suggested
robinson
grinned
you
make
a
rotten
detective
coroner
women
heels
are
cut
to
a
pattern
there
are
thousands
of
shoes
whose
heels
would
fit
this
impression
we
need
the
sole
for
identification
and
that
she
has
left
us
but
she
done
one
favour
she
advertised
herself
as
a
woman
and
there
are
just
three
women
in
the
house
one
of
those
committed
this
serious
offence
and
the
inference
is
obvious
before
bobby
could
protest
the
doctor
broke
in
with
his
throaty
rumble
one
of
those
or
the
woman
who
cried
about
the
house
bobby
started
the
memory
of
that
eerie
grief
was
still
uncomfortable
in
his
brain
could
there
have
been
actually
a
woman
at
the
stagnant
lake
that
afternoon
and
close
to
the
house
some
mysterious
friend
who
assumed
grave
risks
in
his
service
he
recognized
robinson
logic
unless
there
were
something
in
that
theory
katherine
faced
a
situation
nearly
as
serious
as
his
own
robinson
straightened
at
the
same
moment
the
scraping
of
a
window
reached
them
bobby
glanced
at
the
newer
wing
katherine
leaned
from
her
window
the
coincidence
disturbed
him
in
robinson
mind
he
knew
her
anxiety
would
assume
a
colour
of
guilt
her
voice
moreover
was
too
uncertain
too
full
of
misgivings
what
is
going
on
down
there
there
have
been
no
no
more
tragedies
would
you
mind
joining
us
for
a
moment
robinson
asked
she
drew
back
the
curtain
fell
over
her
lighted
window
the
darkness
of
the
court
was
disturbed
again
only
by
the
limited
radiance
of
the
flashlight
she
came
hurriedly
from
the
front
door
i
saw
you
gathered
here
i
heard
you
talking
i
wondered
you
knew
there
were
footprints
in
this
court
robinson
said
harshly
that
howells
connected
them
with
the
murderer
of
your
uncle
yes
she
answered
simply
why
then
he
asked
did
you
attempt
to
obliterate
them
she
laughed
what
do
you
mean
i
did
i
have
been
out
of
the
house
since
just
after
luncheon
can
you
prove
that
it
needs
no
proof
i
tell
you
so
the
flashlight
exposed
the
ugly
confidence
of
robinson
smile
i
am
sorry
to
suggest
the
need
of
corroboration
you
doubt
my
word
she
flashed
a
woman
he
answered
has
obliterated
valuable
testimony
i
shall
make
it
my
business
to
punish
her
she
laughed
again
without
another
word
she
turned
and
reentered
the
house
robinson
oath
was
audible
to
the
others
we
ca
put
up
with
that
sort
of
thing
sir
rawlins
said
i
ought
to
place
this
entire
household
under
arrest
robinson
muttered
as
a
lawyer
graham
said
easily
i
should
think
with
your
lack
of
evidence
it
might
be
asking
for
trouble
there
is
paredes
who
acknowledges
he
was
in
the
court
all
right
i
see
what
he
got
to
say
he
started
for
the
house
bobby
lingered
for
a
moment
with
graham
do
you
know
anything
about
this
hartley
nothing
graham
whispered
then
you
do
think
katherine
if
she
done
it
she
have
taken
good
care
not
to
be
so
curious
i
doubt
if
it
was
katherine
they
followed
the
others
into
the
hall
bobby
scarcely
appreciating
why
at
first
realized
there
had
been
a
change
there
then
he
understood
robinson
faced
an
empty
chair
the
hall
was
pungent
with
cigarette
smoke
but
paredes
had
gone
robinson
pointed
to
the
stairs
get
him
down
he
said
to
rawlins
he
would
have
gone
to
bed
graham
suggested
suppose
he
in
the
old
room
where
howells
lies
but
rawlins
found
him
nowhere
upstairs
with
an
increasing
excitement
robinson
joined
the
search
they
went
through
the
entire
house
paredes
was
no
longer
there
he
had
to
all
appearances
put
a
period
to
his
unwelcome
visit
he
had
definitely
disappeared
from
the
cedars
his
most
likely
exit
was
through
the
kitchen
door
which
was
unlocked
but
jenkins
who
had
returned
to
his
room
had
heard
no
one
with
their
electric
lamps
robinson
and
rawlins
ferreted
about
the
rear
entrance
for
traces
the
path
there
was
as
trampled
and
useless
as
the
one
in
front
rawlins
who
had
gone
some
distance
from
the
house
straightened
with
a
satisfied
exclamation
the
others
joined
him
here
where
he
left
the
path
right
enough
he
said
and
our
foreigner
was
making
any
more
noise
than
he
had
to
he
flashed
his
lamp
on
a
fresh
footprint
in
the
soft
soil
at
the
side
of
the
path
the
mark
of
the
toe
was
deep
and
firm
the
impression
of
the
heel
was
very
light
paredes
it
was
clear
had
walked
from
the
house
on
tiptoe
follow
on
robinson
commanded
i
told
this
fellow
i
wanted
to
question
him
i
scared
him
off
keeping
his
light
on
the
ground
rawlins
led
the
way
across
the
clearing
the
trail
was
simple
enough
to
follow
each
of
the
footprints
was
distinct
each
had
that
peculiarity
that
suggested
the
stealth
of
his
progress
as
they
continued
bobby
responded
to
an
excited
premonition
he
sensed
the
destination
of
the
chase
he
could
picture
paredes
now
in
the
loneliest
portion
of
the
woods
for
the
trail
unquestionably
pointed
to
the
path
he
had
taken
that
afternoon
toward
the
stagnant
lake
hartley
he
said
paredes
left
the
house
to
go
to
the
stagnant
lake
where
i
fancied
i
saw
a
woman
in
black
do
you
see
and
he
did
hear
the
crying
of
a
woman
a
little
while
ago
and
when
we
told
him
he
became
restless
he
wandered
about
the
hall
talking
of
ghosts
a
rendezvous
graham
answered
he
may
have
been
waiting
for
just
that
the
crying
may
have
been
a
signal
perhaps
you
believe
now
bobby
that
the
man
has
had
an
underhanded
purpose
in
staying
here
i
made
too
many
hasty
judgments
in
my
life
hartley
i
go
slow
on
this
i
wait
until
we
see
what
we
find
at
the
lake
rawlins
snapped
off
his
light
the
little
party
paused
at
the
black
entrance
of
the
path
into
the
thicket
he
buried
himself
in
the
woods
rawlins
said
they
crowded
instinctively
closer
in
the
sudden
darkness
a
brisk
wind
had
sprung
up
it
rattled
among
the
trees
and
set
the
dead
leaves
in
gentle
rustling
motion
it
suggested
to
bobby
the
picture
which
had
been
forced
into
his
brain
the
night
of
his
grandfather
death
the
moon
now
possessed
less
light
but
it
reminded
him
again
of
a
drowning
face
and
through
the
darkness
he
could
fancy
the
trees
straining
in
the
wind
like
puny
men
abruptly
the
thought
of
penetrating
the
forest
became
frightening
the
silent
loneliness
of
the
stagnant
lake
seemed
as
unfriendly
and
threatening
as
the
melancholy
of
the
old
room
there
are
too
many
of
us
robinson
was
saying
you
better
go
on
alone
rawlins
and
do
take
any
chances
i
got
to
have
this
man
you
understand
i
think
he
knows
things
worth
while
the
rising
wind
laughed
at
his
whisper
the
detective
flashed
his
lamp
once
shut
it
off
again
and
stepped
into
the
close
embrace
of
the
thicket
suddenly
bobby
grasped
graham
arm
the
little
group
became
tense
breathless
for
across
the
wind
with
a
diffused
quality
a
lack
of
direction
vibrated
to
them
again
the
faint
and
mournful
grief
of
a
woman
chapter
vi
the
one
who
crept
in
the
private
staircase
the
odd
mournful
crying
lost
itself
in
the
restless
lament
of
the
wind
the
thicket
from
which
it
had
seemed
to
issue
assumed
in
the
pallid
moonlight
a
new
unfriendliness
instinctively
the
six
men
moved
closer
together
the
coroner
thin
tones
expressed
his
alarm
what
the
devil
was
that
i
do
really
believe
there
could
be
a
woman
around
here
a
queer
one
the
detective
grunted
the
district
attorney
questioned
bobby
and
graham
that
the
voice
you
heard
from
the
house
graham
nodded
perhaps
not
so
far
away
doctor
groom
hitherto
more
captured
than
any
of
them
by
the
imminence
of
a
spiritual
responsibility
for
the
mystery
of
the
cedars
was
the
first
now
to
reach
for
a
rational
explanation
of
this
new
phase
we
must
let
our
fancies
run
away
with
us
the
coroner
right
for
once
no
excuse
for
a
woman
hiding
in
that
thicket
a
bird
maybe
or
some
animal
sounded
more
like
a
human
being
robinson
objected
the
detective
reasoned
in
a
steady
unmoved
voice
only
a
mad
woman
would
wander
through
the
woods
crying
like
that
without
a
special
purpose
this
man
paredes
has
left
the
house
and
come
through
here
i
guess
it
was
a
signal
graham
and
i
had
thought
of
that
bobby
said
howells
was
a
sharp
one
robinson
mused
but
he
must
have
gone
wrong
on
this
fellow
he
me
the
man
knew
nothing
spoke
of
him
as
a
foreigner
who
lolled
around
smoking
cigarettes
and
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
him
with
a
lot
of
talk
about
ghosts
howells
graham
said
misjudged
the
case
from
the
start
he
was
to
blame
but
his
mistake
cost
him
his
life
robinson
did
answer
bobby
saw
that
the
man
had
discarded
his
intolerant
temper
from
that
change
he
drew
a
new
hope
he
accepted
it
as
the
beginning
of
fulfilment
of
his
prophecy
last
night
that
an
accident
to
howells
and
the
entrance
of
a
new
man
into
the
case
would
give
him
a
fighting
chance
it
was
clearly
paredes
at
the
moment
who
filled
the
district
attorney
mind
go
after
him
he
said
shortly
to
rawlins
if
you
can
get
away
with
it
bring
him
back
and
whoever
you
find
with
him
rawlins
hesitated
i
no
coward
but
i
know
what
happened
to
howells
this
is
an
ordinary
case
i
do
want
to
walk
into
an
ambush
it
would
be
safer
not
to
run
him
down
alone
all
right
robinson
agreed
i
do
care
to
leave
the
cedars
for
the
present
perhaps
graham
but
graham
was
enthusiastic
it
never
occurred
to
bobby
that
he
was
afraid
graham
he
guessed
desired
to
remain
near
katherine
i
go
if
you
like
doctor
groom
rumbled
it
was
probable
that
graham
instinct
to
stay
had
sprung
from
service
rather
than
sentiment
the
man
it
was
reasonable
sought
to
protect
katherine
from
the
cedars
itself
and
from
robinson
too
direct
methods
of
examination
as
an
antidote
for
his
unwelcome
jealousy
bobby
offered
himself
to
rawlins
would
you
mind
if
i
came
too
i
known
paredes
a
long
time
robinson
sneered
what
do
you
think
of
that
rawlins
but
the
detective
stepped
close
and
whispered
in
the
district
attorney
ear
all
right
robinson
said
go
with
if
you
want
mr
blackburn
and
bobby
knew
that
he
would
go
not
to
help
but
to
be
watched
the
others
strayed
toward
the
house
the
three
men
faced
the
entrance
of
the
path
alone
no
more
loud
talk
now
the
detective
warned
if
he
went
on
tiptoe
so
can
we
even
with
this
company
bobby
shrank
from
the
dark
and
restless
forest
with
a
smooth
skill
the
detective
followed
the
unfamiliar
path
from
time
to
time
he
stooped
close
to
the
ground
shaded
his
lamp
with
his
hand
and
pressed
the
control
always
the
light
verified
the
presence
of
paredes
ahead
of
them
bobby
knew
they
were
near
the
stagnant
lake
the
underbrush
was
thicker
they
went
with
more
care
to
limit
the
sound
of
their
passage
among
the
trees
and
each
moment
the
physical
surroundings
of
the
pursuit
increased
bobby
doubt
of
paredes
no
ordinary
impulse
would
bring
a
man
to
such
a
place
in
this
black
hour
before
the
dawn
particularly
paredes
who
spoke
constantly
of
his
superstitious
nature
who
advertised
a
fear
of
the
cedars
the
panamanian
decision
to
remain
his
lack
of
emotion
before
the
tragic
succession
of
events
at
the
house
his
attempt
to
enter
the
corridor
just
before
bobby
had
gone
himself
to
the
old
room
for
the
evidence
his
desire
to
direct
suspicion
against
katherine
finally
this
excursion
in
response
to
the
eerie
crying
all
suggested
a
definite
perhaps
a
dangerous
purpose
in
the
brain
of
the
serene
and
inscrutable
man
they
slipped
to
the
open
space
about
the
lake
the
moon
barely
distinguished
for
them
the
flat
melancholy
stretch
of
water
they
listened
breathlessly
there
was
no
sound
beyond
the
normal
stirrings
of
the
forest
bobby
had
a
feeling
similar
to
the
afternoon
that
he
was
watched
he
tried
unsuccessfully
to
penetrate
the
darkness
across
the
lake
where
he
had
fancied
the
woman
skulking
the
detective
keen
senses
were
satisfied
dollars
to
doughnuts
they
not
here
they
probably
gone
on
have
to
take
a
chance
and
show
the
light
again
fresh
footprints
were
revealed
in
the
narrow
circle
of
illumination
testifying
to
paredes
continued
stealth
they
made
a
straight
line
to
the
water
edge
rawlins
exclaimed
he
stepped
into
the
lake
how
deep
is
it
the
black
surface
of
the
water
seemed
to
bobby
like
an
opaque
glass
hiding
sinister
things
suppose
paredes
instead
of
coming
to
a
rendezvous
had
been
led
it
deep
enough
in
the
centre
he
answered
shallow
around
the
edges
quite
then
he
knew
we
were
after
him
groom
said
rawlins
nodded
and
ran
his
light
along
the
shore
a
few
yards
to
the
right
a
ledge
of
smooth
rock
stretched
from
the
water
to
a
grove
of
pine
trees
the
detective
arose
and
turned
off
his
light
he
blocked
us
he
said
he
knew
he
would
leave
his
marks
on
the
rocks
or
the
pine
needles
no
way
to
guess
his
direction
now
doctor
groom
cleared
his
throat
with
a
hesitant
manner
he
recited
the
discovery
of
the
queer
light
in
the
deserted
house
its
unaccountable
disappearances
their
failure
to
find
its
source
i
was
thinking
he
explained
that
paredes
alone
saw
the
light
give
out
it
was
his
suggestion
that
he
go
to
the
front
of
the
house
to
investigate
this
path
might
be
used
as
a
short
cut
to
the
deserted
house
the
rendezvous
may
have
been
there
rawlins
was
interested
again
how
far
is
it
not
much
more
than
a
mile
groom
answered
then
we
go
the
detective
decided
show
the
way
groom
in
the
lead
they
struck
off
through
the
woods
bobby
who
walked
last
noticed
the
faint
messengers
of
dawn
behind
the
trees
in
the
east
he
was
glad
the
night
cloaked
too
much
in
this
neighbourhood
by
daylight
the
empty
house
would
guard
its
secret
less
easily
suddenly
he
paused
and
stood
quite
still
he
wanted
to
call
to
the
others
to
point
out
what
he
had
seen
there
was
no
question
by
chance
he
had
accomplished
the
task
that
had
seemed
so
hopeless
yesterday
he
had
found
the
spot
where
his
consciousness
had
come
back
momentarily
to
record
a
wet
moon
trees
straining
in
the
wind
like
puny
men
and
a
figure
in
a
mask
which
he
had
called
his
conscience
he
gazed
his
hope
retreating
before
an
unforeseen
disappointment
for
with
the
paling
moon
and
the
bent
trees
survived
that
very
figure
on
the
discovery
of
whose
nature
he
had
built
so
vital
a
hope
and
in
this
bad
light
it
conveyed
to
him
an
appearance
nearly
human
through
the
underbrush
the
trunk
of
a
tree
shattered
by
some
violent
storm
mocked
him
with
its
illusion
the
dead
leaves
at
the
top
were
like
cloth
across
a
face
therefore
he
argued
there
had
been
no
conspiracy
against
him
paredes
was
clean
as
far
as
that
was
concerned
he
had
wandered
about
the
cedars
alone
he
had
opened
his
eyes
at
a
point
between
the
court
and
the
deserted
house
rawlins
turned
back
suspiciously
asking
why
he
loitered
he
continued
almost
indifferently
he
still
wanted
to
know
paredes
goal
but
his
disappointment
and
its
meaning
obsessed
him
when
they
crept
up
the
growing
light
exposed
the
scars
of
the
deserted
house
everything
was
as
bobby
remembered
it
at
the
front
there
was
no
decayed
wood
or
vegetation
to
strengthen
the
doctor
theory
of
a
phosphorescent
emanation
the
tangle
of
footsteps
near
the
rear
door
was
confusing
and
it
was
some
time
before
the
three
men
straightened
and
glanced
at
each
other
knowing
that
the
doctor
wisdom
was
proved
for
paredes
had
been
there
recently
for
that
matter
might
still
be
in
the
house
moreover
he
had
hidden
his
tracks
as
he
could
have
done
in
the
thick
grass
instead
he
had
come
in
a
straight
line
from
the
woods
across
a
piece
of
sandy
ground
which
contained
the
record
of
his
direction
and
his
continued
stealth
but
inside
they
found
nothing
except
matches
strewn
across
the
floor
testimony
of
their
earlier
search
the
fugitive
had
evidently
left
more
carefully
than
he
had
come
the
chill
emptiness
of
the
deserted
house
had
drawn
and
released
him
ahead
of
the
chase
i
guess
he
knew
what
the
light
meant
the
detective
said
as
well
as
he
did
that
queer
calling
it
complicates
matters
that
i
ca
find
a
woman
footprints
around
here
she
may
have
kept
to
the
grass
and
this
path
for
since
i
do
believe
in
banshees
i
swear
there
been
a
woman
around
either
a
crazy
woman
wandering
at
large
who
might
be
connected
with
the
murders
or
else
a
sane
one
who
signalled
the
foreigner
let
get
back
and
see
what
the
district
attorney
makes
of
it
it
might
be
wiser
not
to
dismiss
the
banshees
as
you
call
them
too
hurriedly
doctor
groom
rumbled
as
they
returned
along
the
road
in
the
growing
light
bobby
lost
the
feeling
he
had
had
of
being
spied
upon
the
memory
of
such
an
adventure
was
bound
to
breed
something
like
confidence
among
its
actors
rawlins
bobby
hoped
would
be
less
unfriendly
the
detective
in
fact
talked
as
much
to
him
as
to
the
doctor
he
assured
them
that
robinson
would
get
the
panamanian
unless
he
proved
miraculously
clever
he
shown
us
that
he
knows
something
he
went
on
i
do
say
how
much
because
i
ca
get
a
motive
to
make
it
worth
his
while
to
commit
such
crimes
the
man
smiled
blandly
at
bobby
while
in
your
case
there
a
motive
at
least
the
money
he
chuckled
that
the
easiest
motive
to
understand
in
the
world
it
stronger
than
love
bobby
wondered
love
had
been
the
impulse
for
the
last
few
months
folly
that
had
led
him
into
his
present
situation
graham
over
his
stern
principles
of
right
had
already
stepped
outside
the
law
in
backing
katherine
efforts
to
save
bobby
so
he
wondered
how
much
graham
would
risk
how
far
he
was
capable
of
going
himself
at
the
inspiration
of
such
a
motive
the
sun
was
up
when
they
reached
the
cedars
katherine
had
gone
to
her
room
the
coroner
had
left
robinson
and
graham
had
built
a
fresh
fire
in
the
hall
they
sat
there
talking
where
you
been
robinson
demanded
we
about
decided
the
spooks
had
done
for
you
the
detective
outlined
their
failure
the
district
attorney
listened
with
a
frown
at
the
end
he
arose
and
without
saying
anything
walked
to
the
telephone
when
he
returned
he
appeared
better
satisfied
paredes
he
said
will
have
to
be
a
slick
article
to
make
a
clean
getaway
and
i
bringing
another
man
to
keep
reporters
out
they
know
from
howells
murder
that
blackburn
did
die
a
natural
death
if
reporters
get
in
do
talk
to
them
i
do
want
that
damned
foreigner
reading
in
the
papers
what
going
on
here
i
give
my
job
to
have
him
in
that
chair
for
five
minutes
now
graham
cleared
his
throat
i
scarcely
know
how
to
suggest
this
since
it
is
sufficiently
clear
because
of
howells
suspicions
that
you
have
blackburn
under
close
observation
but
he
has
a
fair
idea
of
paredes
habits
his
haunts
and
his
friends
in
new
york
he
might
be
able
to
learn
things
the
police
could
i
one
or
two
matters
to
take
me
to
town
i
would
make
myself
personally
responsible
for
his
return
the
district
attorney
interrupted
i
see
what
you
mean
wait
a
minute
he
clasped
his
hands
and
rolled
his
fat
thumbs
one
around
the
other
the
little
eyes
surrounded
by
puffy
flesh
became
enigmatic
all
at
once
he
glanced
up
with
a
genial
smile
why
not
i
have
said
anything
about
holding
blackburn
as
more
than
a
witness
his
tone
chilled
bobby
as
thoroughly
as
a
direct
accusation
would
have
done
and
robinson
went
on
the
sooner
you
go
the
better
the
sooner
you
get
back
the
better
graham
was
visibly
puzzled
by
this
prompt
acquiescence
he
started
for
the
stairs
but
the
district
attorney
waved
him
aside
coats
and
hats
are
downstairs
no
need
wasting
time
graham
turned
to
doctor
groom
you
tell
miss
perrine
doctor
the
doctor
showed
that
he
understood
the
warning
graham
wished
to
convey
the
district
attorney
made
a
point
of
walking
to
the
stable
to
see
them
off
graham
gestured
angrily
as
they
drove
away
it
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
i
was
too
anxious
to
test
their
attitude
toward
you
bobby
he
jumped
at
the
chance
to
run
us
out
of
the
house
he
have
several
hours
during
which
to
turn
the
place
upside
down
to
give
katherine
the
third
degree
and
we
ca
go
back
have
to
see
it
through
why
should
he
give
me
a
chance
to
slip
away
bobby
asked
but
before
long
he
realized
that
robinson
was
taking
no
chances
at
the
junction
of
the
road
from
smithtown
a
car
picked
them
up
and
clung
to
their
heels
all
the
way
to
the
city
rawlins
must
have
telephoned
graham
said
while
we
went
to
the
stable
they
still
playing
howells
game
they
give
you
plenty
of
rope
he
drove
straight
to
bobby
apartment
the
elevator
man
verified
their
suspicions
robinson
had
telephoned
the
new
york
police
for
a
search
a
familiar
type
of
metropolitan
detective
met
them
in
the
hall
outside
bobby
door
i
through
gentlemen
he
greeted
them
impudently
graham
faced
him
in
a
burst
of
temper
the
city
may
have
to
pay
for
this
outrage
the
man
grinned
i
should
get
gray
hairs
about
that
he
went
on
downstairs
they
entered
the
apartment
to
find
confusion
in
each
room
bureau
drawers
had
been
turned
upside
down
the
desk
had
been
examined
with
a
reckless
thoroughness
graham
was
frankly
worried
i
wonder
if
he
found
anything
if
he
did
you
wo
get
out
of
town
what
could
he
find
bobby
asked
if
the
court
was
planted
graham
answered
why
should
these
rooms
have
been
after
last
night
i
do
believe
the
court
was
planted
bobby
said
in
the
lower
hall
the
elevator
man
handed
bobby
the
mail
that
had
come
since
the
night
of
his
grandfather
murder
in
the
car
again
he
glanced
over
the
envelopes
he
tore
one
open
with
a
surprised
haste
this
is
maria
handwriting
he
told
graham
he
read
the
hastily
scrawled
note
aloud
with
a
tone
that
failed
toward
the
end
dear
bobby
you
must
not
as
you
say
think
me
a
bad
sport
you
were
very
wicked
last
night
maybe
you
were
so
because
of
too
many
of
those
naughty
little
cocktails
why
should
you
threaten
poor
maria
and
you
boasted
you
were
going
out
to
the
cedars
to
kill
your
grandfather
because
you
did
like
him
any
more
so
i
told
carlos
to
take
you
home
i
was
afraid
of
a
scene
in
public
come
around
have
tea
with
me
tell
me
you
forgive
me
tell
me
what
was
the
matter
with
you
she
must
have
written
that
yesterday
morning
bobby
muttered
good
lord
hartley
then
it
was
in
my
mind
unless
that
letter
a
plant
too
graham
said
yet
how
could
she
know
there
be
a
search
why
should
she
have
addressed
it
to
the
cedars
where
there
was
a
fair
chance
of
its
being
opened
and
read
by
the
police
why
has
my
man
made
any
report
on
her
we
a
number
of
questions
to
ask
maria
but
word
came
down
from
the
dancer
apartment
that
maria
was
at
home
when
did
she
go
out
graham
asked
the
hall
man
not
since
i
came
on
duty
at
six
graham
slipped
a
bill
in
the
man
hand
we
an
important
message
for
her
we
better
leave
it
with
the
maid
when
they
were
alone
in
the
upper
hall
he
explained
his
purpose
to
bobby
we
must
know
whether
she
actually
here
if
she
is
if
she
been
back
for
the
last
hours
do
you
see
it
was
yesterday
afternoon
you
thought
you
saw
a
woman
at
the
lake
and
last
night
a
woman
cried
about
the
cedars
that
going
pretty
far
hartley
it
a
chance
a
physical
one
a
pretty
maid
opened
the
door
her
face
was
troubled
she
studied
them
with
frank
disappointment
i
thought
she
began
that
your
mistress
was
coming
back
graham
flashed
there
was
no
concealment
in
the
girl
manner
it
was
certain
that
maria
was
not
in
the
apartment
you
remember
me
bobby
asked
yes
you
have
been
here
you
are
a
friend
of
mademoiselle
you
can
perhaps
tell
me
where
she
is
bobby
shook
his
head
the
girl
spread
her
hands
she
burst
out
excitedly
what
is
one
to
do
i
have
telephoned
the
theatre
there
was
no
one
there
who
knew
anything
at
all
except
that
mademoiselle
had
not
appeared
at
the
performance
last
night
graham
glanced
at
bobby
when
he
asked
did
you
see
her
last
it
was
before
luncheon
yesterday
did
she
leave
no
instructions
did
she
say
when
she
would
be
back
the
girl
nodded
that
what
worries
me
for
she
said
she
would
be
back
after
the
performance
last
night
she
left
no
instructions
graham
repeated
only
that
if
any
one
called
or
telephoned
i
was
to
make
no
appointments
what
am
i
to
do
perhaps
i
should
be
talking
to
you
she
would
never
forgive
me
for
an
indiscretion
for
the
present
i
advise
you
to
do
nothing
graham
said
you
can
safely
leave
all
that
to
her
managers
i
am
going
to
see
them
now
i
will
tell
them
what
you
have
said
the
girl
eyes
moistened
thank
you
sir
i
have
been
at
my
wits
end
apparently
she
withheld
nothing
she
played
no
part
to
confuse
the
dancer
friends
on
the
way
to
the
managers
office
with
the
trailing
car
behind
them
graham
reasoned
excitedly
for
the
first
time
we
seem
to
be
actually
on
the
track
here
a
tangible
clue
that
may
lead
to
the
heart
of
the
case
maria
pulled
the
wool
over
the
maid
eyes
too
she
did
want
her
to
know
her
plans
but
her
instructions
show
that
she
had
no
intention
of
returning
last
night
she
probably
made
a
bee
line
for
the
cedars
it
was
probably
she
that
you
saw
at
the
lake
probably
she
who
cried
last
night
if
only
she
had
written
that
note
i
ca
get
the
meaning
of
it
it
up
to
her
managers
now
if
they
have
heard
from
her
it
a
safe
guess
playing
a
deep
game
connected
with
the
crying
and
the
light
at
the
deserted
house
and
the
disappearance
of
paredes
before
dawn
you
must
realize
the
connection
between
that
and
your
condition
the
other
evening
after
you
had
left
them
bobby
nodded
he
began
to
hope
that
at
the
managers
office
they
would
receive
no
explanation
of
maria
absence
destructive
to
graham
theory
early
as
it
was
they
found
a
man
in
his
shirt
sleeves
pacing
with
an
air
of
panic
a
blantantly
furnished
office
well
he
burst
out
as
they
entered
my
secretary
tells
me
you
come
about
this
temperamental
carmen
of
mine
tell
me
where
she
is
quick
graham
smiled
at
bobby
the
manager
ran
his
fingers
across
his
bald
and
shining
forehead
it
no
laughing
matter
then
she
has
definitely
disappeared
graham
said
disappeared
why
did
i
come
down
at
this
ungodly
hour
except
on
the
chance
of
getting
some
word
she
did
even
telephone
last
night
i
had
to
show
myself
in
front
of
the
curtain
and
give
them
a
spiel
about
a
sudden
indisposition
and
believe
me
gentlemen
audiences
ai
what
they
used
to
be
did
these
ginks
sit
back
and
take
the
show
for
what
it
was
worth
not
by
a
darn
sight
flocked
to
the
box
office
and
howled
for
their
money
back
if
she
does
appear
i
might
as
well
close
the
house
i
be
ruined
unless
graham
suggested
you
get
your
press
agent
to
make
capital
out
of
her
absence
the
papers
would
publish
her
picture
and
thousands
of
people
would
look
her
up
for
you
the
manager
ceased
his
perplexed
massage
of
his
forehead
he
shook
hands
genially
i
thought
of
that
with
some
frills
beautiful
dancer
met
foul
play
millions
in
jewels
on
her
person
when
last
seen
old
stuff
but
they
rise
to
it
that
will
help
graham
said
to
bobby
when
they
were
in
the
car
again
the
reporters
will
find
maria
quicker
than
any
detective
i
can
put
my
hand
on
my
man
evidently
fell
down
because
she
had
gone
before
i
got
him
on
the
case
at
his
office
they
learned
that
was
the
fact
the
private
detective
had
been
able
to
get
no
slightest
clue
as
to
whereabouts
moreover
bobby
description
of
the
stranger
who
had
entered
the
cafe
with
her
merely
suggested
a
type
familiar
to
the
tenderloin
for
purposes
of
identification
it
was
worthless
always
followed
by
the
car
from
smithtown
they
went
to
the
hotel
where
paredes
had
lived
to
a
number
of
his
haunts
bobby
talked
with
men
who
knew
him
but
he
learned
nothing
paredes
friends
had
had
no
word
since
the
departure
for
the
cedars
the
day
before
so
they
turned
their
backs
on
the
city
elated
by
the
significance
of
maria
absence
yet
worried
by
the
search
and
the
watchful
car
which
never
lost
sight
of
them
when
they
were
in
the
country
graham
sighed
his
relief
you
have
been
stopped
therefore
nothing
was
found
at
your
apartment
but
if
that
planted
why
should
maria
have
sent
an
incriminating
note
there
unless
bobby
answered
she
told
the
truth
unless
she
was
sincere
when
she
mailed
it
unless
she
learned
something
important
between
the
time
she
wrote
it
and
her
disappearance
from
her
home
frankly
bobby
graham
said
the
note
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
came
to
you
are
as
damaging
as
the
footprints
and
the
handkerchief
but
it
does
tell
us
how
any
human
being
could
have
entered
that
room
to
commit
the
murders
and
disturb
the
bodies
at
least
we
got
one
physical
fact
and
i
going
to
work
on
that
if
it
is
maria
prowling
around
the
cedars
bobby
said
she
amazingly
slippery
and
with
paredes
gone
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
your
physical
fact
and
how
does
it
explain
the
friendly
influence
that
wiped
out
my
footprints
is
it
a
friendly
or
an
evil
influence
that
snatched
away
the
evidence
and
that
keeps
it
secreted
we
see
graham
said
i
going
after
a
criminal
who
is
you
i
going
to
try
to
find
out
what
your
grandfather
was
afraid
of
the
night
of
his
murder
after
a
time
he
glanced
up
you
known
paredes
for
a
long
time
bobby
but
i
do
think
ever
told
me
how
you
met
him
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
should
think
bobby
answered
somebody
brought
him
to
the
club
i
forgotten
who
carlos
was
working
for
a
big
panama
importing
firm
he
was
trying
to
interest
this
chap
in
the
new
york
end
i
saw
him
off
and
on
after
that
and
got
to
like
him
for
his
quiet
manner
and
a
queer
dry
wit
he
had
in
those
days
two
or
three
months
ago
he
he
seemed
to
fit
into
my
humour
and
we
became
pretty
chummy
as
you
know
even
after
last
night
i
hate
to
believe
he
my
enemy
he
your
enemy
graham
answered
and
last
night
the
weak
joint
in
his
armour
i
wonder
if
robinson
did
scare
him
away
by
threatening
to
question
him
paredes
is
connected
with
that
company
now
is
he
i
gather
he
has
no
regular
position
no
he
picked
up
one
or
two
temporary
things
with
the
fruit
companies
more
than
his
running
away
the
thing
that
worries
me
about
carlos
is
his
ridiculous
suspicion
of
katherine
he
told
graham
in
detail
of
that
conversation
graham
frowned
he
opened
the
throttle
wider
their
anxiety
increased
to
know
what
had
happened
at
the
cedars
since
their
departure
the
outposts
of
the
forest
imposed
silence
closed
eagerly
about
them
seemed
to
welcome
them
to
its
dead
loneliness
there
was
a
man
on
guard
at
the
gate
they
hurried
past
the
house
showed
no
sign
of
life
but
when
they
entered
the
court
bobby
saw
katherine
at
her
window
doubtless
attracted
by
the
sounds
of
their
arrival
her
face
brightened
but
she
raised
her
arms
in
a
gesture
suggestive
of
despair
does
she
mean
the
evidence
has
been
found
bobby
asked
graham
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
his
real
interest
the
impulse
at
the
back
of
all
his
efforts
in
bobby
behalf
more
likely
robinson
has
worried
the
life
out
of
her
since
we
been
gone
i
ought
to
have
left
her
i
set
the
trap
myself
when
they
were
in
the
house
their
halting
curiosity
was
lost
in
a
vast
surprise
the
hall
was
empty
but
they
heard
voices
in
the
library
they
hurried
across
the
dining
room
pausing
in
the
doorway
staring
with
unbelieving
eyes
at
the
accustomed
picture
they
had
least
expected
to
see
paredes
lounged
on
the
divan
smoking
with
easy
indifference
his
clothing
and
his
shoes
were
spotless
he
had
shaved
and
his
beard
had
been
freshly
trimmed
rawlins
and
the
district
attorney
stood
in
front
of
the
fireplace
studying
him
with
perplexed
eyes
the
persistence
of
their
regard
even
after
bobby
entrance
suggested
to
him
that
the
evidence
remained
secreted
that
the
officers
under
the
circumstances
were
scarcely
interested
in
his
return
he
was
swept
himself
into
an
explosive
amazement
carlos
what
the
deuce
are
you
doing
here
the
panamanian
expelled
a
cloud
of
smoke
he
smiled
resting
after
a
fatiguing
walk
in
his
unexpected
presence
bobby
fancied
a
demolition
of
the
hope
graham
and
he
had
brought
back
from
the
city
he
could
imagine
guilt
lurking
behind
that
serene
manner
where
did
you
come
from
what
were
you
up
to
last
night
there
was
no
accounting
for
paredes
daring
he
told
himself
no
accounting
for
his
easy
gesture
now
as
he
drew
again
at
his
cigarette
and
tossed
it
in
the
fireplace
these
gentlemen
he
said
have
been
asking
just
that
question
honoured
i
had
no
idea
my
movements
were
of
such
interest
i
told
them
that
i
took
a
stroll
the
night
was
over
there
was
no
point
in
going
to
bed
and
all
day
i
had
been
without
exercise
yet
graham
said
harshly
you
have
had
practically
no
sleep
since
you
came
here
paredes
nodded
very
distressing
is
it
maybe
rawlins
sneered
you
tell
us
why
you
went
on
tiptoe
and
i
suppose
you
did
hear
a
woman
crying
in
the
woods
that
just
it
paredes
answered
i
did
hear
something
like
that
and
it
occurred
to
me
to
follow
such
a
curious
sound
so
i
went
on
tiptoe
as
you
call
it
why
robinson
exclaimed
angrily
you
walked
in
the
lake
to
hide
your
tracks
paredes
smiled
it
was
very
dark
that
was
chance
quite
silly
of
me
my
feet
got
wet
i
gather
rawlins
said
it
was
chance
that
took
you
to
the
deserted
house
paredes
shook
his
head
do
you
think
i
was
as
much
puzzled
as
the
rest
by
that
strange
disappearing
light
it
was
as
good
a
place
to
walk
as
any
where
have
you
been
since
graham
asked
when
i
had
got
there
i
was
tired
paredes
answered
since
it
far
to
the
station
i
thought
i
go
on
into
smithtown
and
have
a
bath
and
rest
but
i
assure
you
i
trudged
back
from
the
station
just
now
suddenly
he
repeated
the
apparently
absurd
formula
he
had
used
with
howells
you
know
the
court
seems
full
of
unfriendly
things
what
the
ignorant
would
call
ghosts
i
spanish
and
i
know
after
a
moment
he
added
the
woods
too
i
should
care
to
wander
through
them
too
much
after
dark
robinson
stared
but
rawlins
brushed
the
question
aside
what
hotel
did
you
go
to
in
smithtown
it
called
the
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
fact
shall
i
see
if
that
straight
sir
the
district
attorney
agreed
and
rawlins
left
the
room
paredes
laughed
how
interesting
i
under
suspicion
it
would
be
something
it
to
commit
crimes
with
the
devilish
ingenuity
of
these
no
no
district
attorney
look
to
the
ghosts
they
alone
are
sufficiently
clever
but
i
might
say
since
you
take
this
attitude
that
i
do
care
to
answer
any
more
questions
until
you
discover
something
that
might
give
you
the
right
to
ask
them
he
lay
back
on
the
divan
languidly
lighting
another
cigarette
graham
beckoned
robinson
bobby
followed
them
out
suspecting
graham
purpose
unwilling
that
action
should
be
taken
too
hastily
against
the
panamanian
for
even
now
guilty
knowledge
seemed
incompatible
with
paredes
polished
reserve
when
he
joined
the
others
indeed
graham
with
an
aggressive
air
was
demanding
the
district
attorney
intentions
if
he
could
elude
you
so
easily
last
night
it
common
sense
to
put
him
where
you
can
find
him
in
case
of
need
he
given
you
excuse
enough
the
man
got
me
guessing
robinson
mused
but
there
are
other
elements
what
happened
since
we
left
graham
asked
quickly
have
you
got
any
trace
of
howells
evidence
robinson
smiled
enigmatically
but
his
failure
was
apparent
i
like
howells
he
said
i
risk
nearly
anything
myself
to
learn
how
the
room
was
entered
how
the
crimes
were
committed
how
those
poor
devils
were
made
to
alter
their
positions
so
bobby
said
you
had
my
rooms
in
new
york
searched
you
had
me
followed
it
ridiculous
robinson
ignored
him
he
stepped
to
the
front
door
opened
it
and
looked
around
the
court
what
did
the
sphinx
mean
about
ghosts
in
the
court
they
walked
out
gazing
helplessly
at
the
trampled
grass
about
the
fountain
at
the
melancholy
walls
at
the
partly
opened
window
of
the
room
of
mystery
he
knows
something
robinson
mused
maybe
you
right
graham
but
i
wonder
if
i
ought
to
go
farther
and
take
you
all
graham
smiled
uncomfortably
but
bobby
knew
why
the
official
failed
to
follow
that
radical
course
like
howells
he
hesitated
to
remove
from
the
cedars
the
person
most
likely
to
solve
its
mystery
as
long
as
a
chance
remained
that
howells
had
been
right
about
bobby
he
would
give
silas
blackburn
grandson
his
head
merely
making
sure
as
he
had
done
this
morning
that
there
should
be
no
escape
he
glanced
up
i
wonder
if
our
foreigner
laughing
at
me
now
graham
made
a
movement
toward
the
door
we
might
he
said
significantly
find
that
out
without
disturbing
him
robinson
nodded
and
led
the
way
silently
back
to
the
house
such
a
method
was
repugnant
to
bobby
and
he
followed
at
a
distance
then
he
saw
from
the
movements
of
the
two
men
ahead
that
the
library
had
again
offered
the
unexpected
and
he
entered
paredes
was
no
longer
in
the
room
bobby
was
about
to
speak
but
robinson
shook
his
head
angrily
raising
his
hand
in
a
gesture
of
warning
all
three
strained
forward
listening
and
bobby
caught
the
sound
that
had
arrested
the
others
a
stealthy
scraping
that
would
have
been
inaudible
except
through
such
a
brooding
silence
as
pervaded
the
old
house
bobby
interest
quickened
at
this
confirmation
of
graham
theory
there
was
a
projection
of
cold
fear
moreover
in
its
sly
allusion
it
gave
to
his
memory
of
paredes
with
his
tall
graceful
figure
his
lack
of
emotion
his
inscrutable
eyes
and
his
pointed
beard
a
suggestion
nearly
satanic
for
the
stealthy
scraping
had
come
from
behind
the
closed
door
of
the
private
staircase
howells
had
gone
up
that
staircase
none
of
them
could
forget
for
a
moment
that
it
led
to
the
private
hall
outside
the
room
in
which
the
murders
had
been
committed
it
occurred
to
bobby
that
the
triumph
graham
face
expressed
was
out
of
keeping
with
the
man
it
disturbed
him
nearly
as
thoroughly
as
stealthy
presence
in
that
place
we
got
him
graham
whispered
robinson
bulky
figure
moved
cautiously
toward
the
door
he
grasped
the
knob
swung
the
door
open
and
stepped
back
smiling
his
satisfaction
half
way
down
the
staircase
paredes
leaned
against
the
wall
one
foot
raised
and
outstretched
as
though
an
infinitely
quiet
descent
had
been
interrupted
the
exposure
had
been
too
quick
for
his
habit
his
face
failed
to
hide
its
discomfiture
his
laugh
rang
false
hello
i
afraid
we
caught
you
paredes
graham
said
and
the
triumph
blazed
now
in
his
voice
what
paredes
did
then
was
more
startling
more
out
of
key
than
any
of
his
recent
actions
he
came
precipitately
down
his
eyes
were
dangerous
as
bobby
watched
the
face
whose
quiet
had
at
last
been
tempestuously
destroyed
he
felt
that
the
man
was
capable
of
anything
under
sufficient
provocation
got
me
for
what
he
snarled
tell
us
why
you
were
sneaking
up
there
in
connection
with
your
little
excursion
before
dawn
it
suggests
a
guilty
knowledge
paredes
straightened
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
admirable
effort
of
the
will
he
smoothed
the
rage
from
his
face
but
for
bobby
the
satanic
suggestion
lingered
why
do
you
suppose
i
here
he
said
in
a
restrained
voice
that
scarcely
rose
above
a
whisper
to
help
bobby
i
was
simply
looking
around
for
bobby
sake
that
angered
bobby
he
wanted
to
cry
out
against
the
supposed
friend
who
had
at
last
shown
his
teeth
that
graham
laughed
is
why
you
sneaked
why
you
did
make
any
noise
why
you
lost
your
temper
when
we
caught
you
at
it
what
about
it
district
attorney
robinson
stepped
forward
nothing
else
to
do
graham
he
too
slippery
i
put
him
in
a
safe
place
you
mean
paredes
cried
that
you
arrest
me
you
guessed
it
i
lock
you
up
as
a
material
witness
paredes
swung
on
bobby
you
permit
this
bobby
you
forget
that
i
am
a
guest
in
your
house
bobby
flushed
why
have
you
stayed
what
were
you
doing
up
there
answer
those
questions
tell
me
what
you
want
paredes
turned
away
he
took
a
cigarette
from
his
pocket
and
lighted
it
his
fingers
were
not
steady
for
the
first
time
it
became
evident
to
bobby
paredes
was
afraid
rawlins
came
back
from
the
telephone
he
took
in
the
tableau
what
the
rumpus
run
this
man
to
smithtown
robinson
directed
lock
him
up
and
tell
the
judge
when
he
arraigned
in
the
morning
that
i
want
him
held
as
a
material
witness
he
was
at
the
hotel
in
smithtown
all
right
rawlins
said
he
tapped
paredes
arm
you
coming
on
this
little
joy
ride
like
a
lamb
or
a
lion
say
find
the
jail
about
as
comfortable
as
the
new
hotel
paredes
smiled
the
evil
and
dangerous
light
died
in
his
eyes
he
became
all
at
once
easy
and
impervious
again
like
a
lamb
how
else
i
sorry
carlos
bobby
muttered
if
you
only
say
something
if
you
only
explain
your
movements
if
you
only
really
help
again
paredes
shrugged
his
shoulders
handcuffs
he
asked
rawlins
rawlins
ran
his
hands
deftly
over
the
panamanian
clothing
no
armed
neutrality
for
me
he
grinned
all
right
we
forget
the
bracelets
since
you
have
a
gun
puffing
at
his
cigarette
paredes
got
his
coat
and
hat
and
followed
the
detective
from
the
house
robinson
and
graham
climbed
the
private
staircase
to
commence
another
systematic
search
of
the
hall
to
discover
if
they
could
the
motive
for
paredes
stealthy
presence
there
bobby
accepted
greedily
this
opportunity
to
find
katherine
to
learn
from
her
undisturbed
what
had
happened
in
the
house
that
morning
the
meaning
perhaps
of
her
despairing
gesture
when
in
response
to
his
knock
she
opened
her
door
and
stepped
into
the
corridor
he
guessed
her
despair
had
been
an
expression
of
the
increased
strain
of
her
helplessness
in
face
of
robinson
harsh
determination
he
questioned
me
for
an
hour
she
said
principally
about
the
heel
mark
in
the
court
they
cling
to
that
because
i
do
think
found
anything
new
at
the
lake
you
do
know
anything
about
it
do
you
katherine
you
were
there
you
did
do
that
for
me
i
was
there
bobby
i
honestly
do
know
any
more
about
it
than
you
do
carlos
was
in
the
court
he
mused
did
you
know
they
taken
him
we
found
him
creeping
down
the
private
stairway
there
was
a
hard
quality
about
her
gratitude
i
am
glad
bobby
the
man
makes
me
shudder
and
all
morning
they
seemed
more
interested
in
you
than
in
him
they
rummaged
every
room
even
mine
she
laughed
feverishly
that
why
i
been
so
upset
they
seemed
she
broke
off
she
picked
at
her
handkerchief
after
a
moment
she
looked
him
frankly
in
the
eyes
and
continued
they
seemed
almost
as
doubtful
of
me
as
of
you
he
recalled
paredes
suspicion
of
the
girl
it
nonsense
katherine
and
i
to
blame
for
that
too
she
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
her
smile
was
wistful
hush
you
must
blame
yourself
you
must
think
of
that
again
her
solicitude
their
isolation
in
a
darkened
place
tempted
him
aroused
impulses
nearly
irresistible
her
slender
figure
the
pretty
face
grown
familiar
and
more
desirable
through
all
these
years
swept
him
to
a
harsher
revolt
than
he
had
conquered
in
the
library
in
the
face
of
graham
in
spite
of
his
own
intolerable
position
he
knew
he
fight
that
truth
eternally
she
must
have
noticed
his
struggle
without
grasping
its
cause
for
she
touched
his
hand
and
the
wistfulness
of
her
expression
increased
i
wish
you
would
think
of
me
bobby
it
you
we
must
all
think
of
he
accepted
with
a
cold
dismay
the
sisterly
anxiety
of
her
attitude
it
made
his
renunciation
easier
he
walked
away
why
do
you
go
she
called
after
him
he
gestured
vaguely
without
turning
he
did
see
her
again
until
dinner
time
she
was
as
silent
then
as
she
had
been
the
night
before
when
howells
had
sat
with
them
his
moroseness
veiling
a
sharp
interest
in
the
plan
that
was
to
lead
to
his
death
robinson
mood
was
very
different
he
talked
a
great
deal
making
no
effort
to
hide
his
irritation
his
failure
to
find
any
clue
in
the
private
staircase
after
paredes
arrest
had
clearly
stimulated
his
interest
in
bobby
the
sharp
little
eyes
surrounded
by
puffy
flesh
held
a
threat
for
him
bobby
was
glad
when
the
meal
ended
howells
body
was
taken
away
that
night
it
was
a
relief
for
all
of
them
to
know
that
the
old
room
was
empty
again
i
daresay
you
wo
sleep
there
graham
said
to
robinson
robinson
glanced
at
bobby
not
as
things
stand
he
answered
the
library
lounge
is
plenty
good
enough
for
me
tonight
graham
went
upstairs
with
bobby
there
was
no
question
about
his
purpose
he
would
repeat
last
night
mistake
at
least
he
said
when
the
door
was
closed
behind
them
i
can
see
if
you
do
get
up
and
wander
about
in
your
sleep
i
bet
a
good
deal
that
you
wo
if
i
did
it
would
be
an
indication
granted
it
your
custom
what
is
there
to
tempt
you
bobby
answered
half
jesting
you
not
forgotten
robinson
on
the
library
sofa
the
man
is
exactly
working
for
me
tonight
he
seems
almost
as
unfriendly
as
howells
was
he
yawned
i
ought
to
sleep
now
if
ever
i
seldom
been
so
tired
two
such
nights
he
hesitated
but
i
am
glad
you
here
hartley
i
can
go
to
sleep
with
a
more
comfortable
feeling
do
worry
graham
said
you
sleep
quietly
enough
and
we
all
be
better
for
a
good
rest
for
only
a
little
while
they
talked
of
the
mystery
while
graham
regretted
his
failure
to
find
any
trace
of
maria
their
voices
dwindled
sleepily
bobby
recalled
his
last
thought
before
losing
himself
last
night
he
tried
to
force
from
his
mind
now
the
threat
in
robinson
eyes
he
told
himself
again
and
again
that
the
man
was
actually
unfriendly
then
the
blackness
encircled
him
he
slept
almost
at
once
it
seemed
to
him
he
was
fighting
away
demanding
drowsily
what
the
matter
leave
me
alone
he
heard
graham
voice
unnaturally
subdued
and
anxious
what
are
you
doing
bobby
then
bobby
knew
he
was
no
longer
in
his
bed
that
he
stood
instead
in
a
cold
place
and
the
meaning
of
his
position
came
with
a
rush
of
sick
terror
get
hold
of
yourself
graham
said
come
back
bobby
opened
his
eyes
he
was
in
the
upper
hall
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
unconsciously
he
had
been
about
to
creep
quietly
down
perhaps
to
the
library
graham
had
awakened
him
it
seemed
to
offer
the
answer
to
everything
it
seemed
to
give
outline
to
a
monstrous
familiar
that
drowned
his
real
self
in
the
black
pit
while
it
conducted
his
body
to
the
commission
of
unspeakable
crimes
he
lurched
into
the
bedroom
and
sat
shivering
on
the
bed
graham
entered
and
quietly
closed
the
door
what
time
is
it
bobby
asked
hoarsely
two
i
do
think
robinson
was
aroused
the
damp
moon
gave
an
ominous
unreality
to
the
room
what
did
i
do
bobby
whispered
got
softly
out
of
bed
and
went
to
the
hall
it
was
uncanny
you
were
like
an
automaton
i
did
wake
you
at
once
you
see
i
i
thought
you
might
go
to
the
old
room
bobby
shook
again
he
drew
a
blanket
about
his
shoulders
and
you
believed
i
show
the
way
in
and
out
but
the
room
was
empty
so
i
was
going
downstairs
he
shuddered
good
god
then
it
all
true
i
did
it
for
the
money
i
put
howells
out
to
protect
myself
i
was
going
after
robinson
it
true
hartley
tell
me
do
you
think
it
true
graham
turned
away
do
ask
me
to
say
anything
to
help
you
just
now
he
answered
huskily
for
after
this
i
do
dare
bobby
i
do
dare
chapter
vii
the
amazing
meeting
in
the
shadows
of
the
old
courtyard
bobby
returned
to
his
bed
he
lay
there
still
shivering
beneath
the
heavy
blankets
i
do
dare
he
echoed
graham
words
there
nothing
else
any
one
can
say
i
must
decide
what
to
do
i
must
think
it
over
but
as
always
thought
brought
no
release
it
merely
insisted
that
the
case
against
him
was
proved
at
last
he
had
been
seen
slipping
unconsciously
from
his
room
and
at
the
same
hour
all
that
remained
was
to
learn
how
he
had
accomplished
the
apparent
miracles
then
no
excuse
would
remain
for
not
going
to
robinson
and
confessing
the
woman
at
the
lake
and
in
the
courtyard
the
movement
of
the
body
and
the
vanishing
of
the
evidence
under
his
hand
paredes
odd
behaviour
all
became
in
his
mind
puzzling
details
that
failed
to
obscure
the
chief
fact
after
this
something
must
be
done
about
paredes
detention
he
had
dreamed
that
his
weariness
could
placate
even
momentarily
such
reflections
but
at
last
he
slept
again
he
was
aroused
by
the
tramping
of
men
around
the
house
and
strange
harsh
voices
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
glanced
from
the
window
it
had
long
been
daylight
two
burly
fellows
in
overalls
carrying
pick
and
spade
across
their
shoulders
pushed
through
the
underbrush
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
he
turned
graham
fully
dressed
stood
at
the
side
of
the
bed
those
men
bobby
asked
wearily
the
grave
diggers
graham
answered
they
are
going
to
work
in
the
old
cemetery
to
prepare
a
place
for
silas
blackburn
with
his
fathers
why
i
come
to
wake
you
up
the
minister
telephoned
katherine
he
will
be
here
before
noon
do
you
know
it
after
ten
for
some
time
bobby
stared
through
the
window
at
the
desolate
ragged
landscape
it
was
abnormally
cold
even
for
the
late
fall
dull
clouds
obscured
the
sun
and
furnished
an
illusion
of
crowding
earthward
a
funereal
day
the
words
slipped
into
his
mind
he
repeated
them
when
your
grandfather
buried
graham
answered
softly
we
all
feel
happier
why
bobby
asked
it
wo
lessen
the
fact
of
his
murder
time
graham
said
lessens
such
facts
even
for
the
police
bobby
glanced
at
him
flushing
you
mean
you
decided
to
stand
by
me
after
what
happened
last
night
graham
smiled
i
thought
it
all
over
i
slept
like
a
top
last
night
i
heard
nothing
i
saw
nothing
ought
i
to
want
you
to
stand
by
me
bobby
said
ought
i
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
at
least
i
must
do
something
about
paredes
graham
frowned
it
hard
to
believe
he
had
any
connection
with
your
last
night
yet
it
as
clear
as
ever
that
maria
and
he
are
up
to
some
game
in
which
you
figure
he
should
be
in
jail
bobby
persisted
get
up
graham
advised
bathe
and
have
some
breakfast
then
we
can
decide
there
no
use
talking
of
the
other
thing
i
forgotten
it
as
far
as
possible
you
must
bobby
sprang
upright
how
can
i
forget
it
if
it
was
hard
to
face
sleep
before
what
do
you
think
it
is
now
have
i
any
right
do
graham
said
i
be
with
you
again
if
i
were
satisfied
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
i
advise
you
to
confess
but
i
ca
be
until
i
know
what
maria
and
paredes
are
doing
when
bobby
had
bathed
and
dressed
he
found
in
spite
of
his
mental
turmoil
that
his
sleep
had
done
him
good
while
he
breakfasted
graham
urged
him
to
eat
tried
to
drive
from
his
brain
the
morbid
aftermath
of
last
night
revealing
moment
the
manager
took
my
advice
but
maria
still
missing
her
pictures
are
in
most
of
the
papers
there
have
been
reporters
here
this
morning
about
the
murders
he
strolled
over
and
handed
bobby
a
number
of
newspapers
where
robinson
bobby
asked
i
saw
him
in
the
court
a
while
ago
i
daresay
he
wandering
around
perhaps
watching
the
men
at
the
grave
he
learned
nothing
new
last
night
i
was
with
him
at
breakfast
i
gather
not
bobby
looked
up
is
that
an
automobile
coming
through
the
woods
he
asked
maybe
rawlins
back
from
smithtown
or
the
minister
the
car
stopped
at
the
entrance
of
the
court
they
heard
the
remote
tinkling
of
the
front
door
bell
jenkins
passed
through
the
cold
air
invading
the
hall
and
the
dining
room
told
them
he
had
opened
the
door
his
sharp
exclamation
recalled
howells
report
which
at
their
direction
he
had
failed
to
mail
had
his
exclamation
been
drawn
by
an
accuser
bobby
started
to
rise
graham
moved
toward
the
door
then
jenkins
entered
and
stood
to
one
side
bobby
shared
his
astonishment
for
paredes
walked
in
unbuttoning
his
overcoat
the
former
uncommunicative
foreigner
he
appeared
moreover
to
have
slept
pleasantly
his
eyes
showed
no
weariness
his
clothing
no
disarrangement
he
spoke
at
once
quite
as
if
nothing
disagreeable
had
shadowed
his
departure
good
morning
if
i
had
dreamed
of
this
change
in
the
weather
i
would
have
brought
a
heavier
overcoat
i
nearly
frozen
driving
from
smithtown
before
either
man
could
grope
for
a
suitable
greeting
he
faced
bobby
he
felt
in
his
pockets
with
whimsical
discouragement
fact
is
bobby
i
left
new
york
too
suddenly
i
had
noticed
until
a
little
while
ago
you
see
i
spent
a
good
deal
in
smithtown
yesterday
bobby
spoke
with
an
obvious
confusion
what
do
you
mean
carlos
i
thought
you
were
graham
interrupted
with
a
flat
demand
for
an
explanation
how
did
you
get
away
paredes
waved
his
hand
later
graham
there
is
a
hack
driver
outside
who
is
even
more
suspicious
than
you
he
wants
to
be
paid
i
asked
rawlins
to
drive
me
back
but
he
rushed
from
the
courthouse
probably
to
telephone
his
rotund
superior
fact
is
this
fellow
wants
five
dollars
an
outrageous
rate
i
told
him
so
but
it
does
do
any
good
so
will
you
lend
me
bobby
bobby
handed
him
a
banknote
he
did
miss
graham
meaning
glance
paredes
gave
the
money
to
the
butler
pay
him
will
you
jenkins
thanks
he
surveyed
the
remains
of
bobby
breakfast
he
sat
down
may
i
my
breakfast
was
early
and
prison
food
when
you
not
in
the
habit
bobby
tried
to
account
for
paredes
friendly
manner
that
he
should
have
come
back
at
all
was
sufficiently
strange
but
it
was
harder
to
understand
why
he
should
express
no
resentment
for
his
treatment
yesterday
why
he
should
fail
to
refer
to
bobby
questions
at
the
moment
of
his
arrest
or
to
the
openly
expressed
enmity
of
graham
only
one
theory
promised
to
fit
at
all
it
was
necessary
for
the
panamanian
to
return
to
the
cedars
his
purpose
whatever
it
was
compelled
him
to
remain
for
the
present
in
the
mournful
tragic
house
therefore
he
would
crush
his
justifiable
anger
he
would
make
it
practically
impossible
for
bobby
to
refuse
his
hospitality
and
he
had
asked
for
money
only
a
trifling
sum
yet
graham
would
grasp
at
the
fact
to
support
his
earlier
suspicion
paredes
arrival
possessed
one
virtue
it
diverted
bobby
thoughts
temporarily
from
his
own
dilemma
from
his
inability
to
chart
a
course
graham
on
the
other
hand
was
ill
at
ease
beyond
a
doubt
he
was
disarmed
by
paredes
good
humour
for
him
yesterday
incident
was
not
so
lightly
to
be
passed
over
eventually
his
curiosity
conquered
the
words
came
nevertheless
with
some
difficulty
we
scarcely
expected
you
back
his
laugh
was
short
and
embarrassed
we
took
it
for
granted
you
would
find
it
necessary
to
stay
in
smithtown
for
a
while
paredes
sipped
the
coffee
which
jenkins
had
poured
splendid
coffee
you
should
have
tasted
what
i
had
this
morning
simple
enough
graham
i
telephoned
as
soon
as
rawlins
got
me
to
the
bastille
i
communicated
with
the
lawyer
who
represents
the
company
for
which
i
once
worked
he
a
prominent
and
brilliant
man
he
planned
it
with
some
local
fellow
when
i
was
arraigned
at
the
opening
of
court
this
morning
the
judge
could
hold
me
only
as
a
material
witness
he
fixed
a
pretty
stiff
bail
but
the
local
lawyer
was
there
with
a
bondsman
and
i
came
back
my
clothes
are
here
you
do
mind
bobby
that
moment
in
the
hall
when
graham
had
awakened
him
urged
bobby
to
reply
with
a
genuine
warmth
i
do
mind
i
glad
you
out
of
it
i
sorry
you
went
as
you
did
i
was
tired
at
my
wits
end
your
presence
in
the
private
staircase
was
the
last
straw
you
will
forgive
us
carlos
paredes
smiled
he
put
down
his
coffee
cup
and
lighted
a
cigarette
he
smoked
with
a
vast
contentment
that
better
nothing
to
forgive
bobby
let
us
call
it
a
misunderstanding
graham
moved
closer
perhaps
you
tell
us
now
what
you
were
doing
in
the
private
staircase
paredes
blew
a
wreath
of
smoke
his
eyes
still
smiled
but
his
voice
was
harder
bygones
are
bygones
is
that
so
bobby
since
you
wish
it
bobby
said
but
more
important
than
the
knowledge
graham
desired
loomed
the
old
question
what
was
the
man
game
what
held
him
here
robinson
entered
the
flesh
around
his
eyes
was
puffier
than
it
had
been
yesterday
worry
had
increased
the
incongruous
discontent
of
his
round
face
clearly
he
had
slept
little
i
saw
you
arrive
he
said
rawlins
warned
me
but
i
must
say
i
think
you
use
your
freedom
to
come
to
us
paredes
laughed
since
the
law
wo
hold
me
at
your
convenience
in
smithtown
i
keep
myself
at
your
service
here
if
bobby
permits
it
could
you
ask
more
bobby
shrank
from
the
man
with
whom
he
had
idled
away
so
much
time
and
money
that
fleeting
satanic
impression
of
yesterday
came
back
sharper
more
alarming
paredes
clear
challenge
to
the
district
attorney
was
the
measure
of
his
strength
his
mind
was
subtler
than
theirs
his
reserve
and
easy
daring
mastered
them
all
and
always
as
now
he
laughed
at
the
futility
of
their
efforts
to
sound
his
purposes
to
limit
his
freedom
of
action
bobby
did
care
to
meet
the
uncommunicative
eyes
whose
depths
he
had
never
been
able
to
explore
was
there
a
special
power
there
that
could
control
the
destinies
of
other
people
that
might
make
men
walk
unconsciously
to
accomplish
the
ends
of
an
unscrupulous
brain
the
district
attorney
appeared
as
much
at
sea
as
the
others
thanks
he
said
dryly
to
paredes
and
glancing
at
bobby
he
asked
with
a
hollow
scorn
you
no
objection
to
the
gentleman
visiting
you
for
the
present
if
he
wishes
bobby
answered
a
trifle
amused
at
robinson
obvious
fancy
of
a
collusion
between
paredes
and
himself
robinson
jerked
his
head
toward
the
window
i
been
watching
the
preparations
out
there
i
guess
when
he
laid
away
you
be
thinking
about
having
the
will
read
no
hurry
bobby
answered
with
a
quick
intake
of
breath
i
suppose
not
robinson
sneered
since
everybody
knows
well
enough
what
in
it
bobby
arose
robinson
still
sneered
you
be
at
the
grave
as
chief
mourner
bobby
walked
from
the
room
he
had
cared
to
reply
he
feared
as
it
was
that
he
had
let
slip
his
increased
he
put
on
his
coat
and
hat
and
left
the
house
the
raw
cold
the
year
first
omen
of
winter
made
his
blood
run
quicker
forced
into
his
mind
a
cleansing
stimulation
but
almost
immediately
even
that
prophylactic
was
denied
him
with
his
direction
a
matter
of
indifference
chance
led
him
into
the
thicket
at
the
side
of
the
house
he
had
walked
some
distance
the
underbrush
had
long
interposed
a
veil
between
him
and
the
cedars
above
whose
roofs
smoke
wreathed
in
the
still
air
like
fantastic
figures
weaving
a
shroud
to
lower
over
the
melancholy
walls
for
once
he
was
grateful
to
the
forest
because
it
had
forbidden
him
to
glance
perpetually
back
at
that
dismal
and
pensive
picture
then
he
became
aware
of
twigs
hastily
lopped
off
of
bushes
bent
and
torn
of
the
uncovering
through
these
careless
means
of
an
old
path
simultaneously
there
reached
his
ears
the
scraping
of
metal
implements
in
the
soft
soil
the
dull
thud
of
earth
falling
regularly
he
paused
listening
the
labour
of
the
men
was
given
an
uncouth
rhythm
by
their
grunting
expulsions
of
breath
otherwise
the
nature
of
their
industry
and
its
surroundings
had
imposed
upon
them
a
silence
in
itself
and
unnatural
at
last
a
harsh
voice
came
to
bobby
its
brevity
pointed
the
previous
dumbness
of
the
speaker
deep
enough
and
bobby
turned
and
hurried
back
along
the
roughly
restored
path
as
if
fleeing
from
an
immaterial
thing
suddenly
quickened
with
the
power
of
accusation
he
could
picture
the
fresh
oblong
excavation
in
the
soil
of
the
family
burial
ground
he
could
see
where
the
men
had
had
to
tear
bushes
from
among
the
graves
in
order
to
insert
their
tools
there
was
an
ironical
justice
in
the
condition
of
the
old
cemetery
it
had
received
no
interment
since
the
death
of
katherine
father
like
everything
about
the
cedars
silas
blackburn
had
delivered
it
to
the
swift
obliterating
fingers
of
time
if
the
old
man
in
his
selfishness
had
paused
to
gaze
beyond
the
inevitable
fact
of
death
bobby
reflected
he
would
have
guarded
with
a
more
precious
interest
the
drapings
of
his
final
sleep
this
necessary
task
on
which
bobby
had
stumbled
had
made
the
thicket
less
congenial
than
the
house
as
he
walked
back
he
forecasted
with
a
keen
apprehension
his
approaching
ordeal
it
would
doubtless
be
more
difficult
to
endure
than
howells
experiment
over
silas
blackburn
body
in
the
old
room
could
he
witness
the
definite
imprisonment
of
his
grandfather
in
a
narrow
box
could
he
watch
the
covering
earth
fall
noisily
in
that
bleak
place
of
silence
without
displaying
for
robinson
the
guilt
that
impressed
him
more
and
more
a
strange
man
appeared
walking
from
the
direction
of
the
house
his
black
clothing
relieved
only
by
narrow
edges
of
white
cuffs
between
the
sleeves
and
the
heavy
mourning
gloves
fitted
with
solemn
harmony
into
the
landscape
and
bobby
mood
such
a
figure
was
appropriate
to
the
cedars
bobby
stepped
to
one
side
placing
a
screen
of
dead
foliage
between
himself
and
the
man
whose
profession
it
was
to
mourn
he
emerged
from
the
forest
and
saw
again
the
leisurely
weaving
of
the
smoke
shroud
above
the
house
then
his
eyes
were
drawn
by
the
restless
movements
of
a
pair
of
horses
standing
in
the
shafts
of
a
black
wagon
at
the
court
entrance
and
his
ordeal
became
like
a
vast
morass
which
offers
no
likely
path
yet
whose
crossing
is
the
price
of
salvation
he
was
glad
to
see
graham
leave
the
court
and
hurry
toward
him
i
was
coming
to
hunt
you
up
bobby
the
minister
arrived
so
has
doctor
groom
everything
about
ready
doctor
groom
yes
he
used
to
see
a
good
deal
of
your
grandfather
it
natural
enough
he
should
be
here
bobby
agreed
indifferently
they
walked
slowly
back
to
the
house
graham
made
it
plain
that
his
mind
was
far
from
the
sad
business
ahead
what
do
you
think
of
paredes
coming
back
as
if
nothing
were
wrong
he
asked
he
ignores
what
happened
yesterday
he
settles
himself
in
the
cedars
again
i
do
know
what
to
think
of
it
bobby
answered
this
morning
carlos
gave
me
the
creeps
graham
glanced
at
him
curiously
he
spoke
with
pronounced
deliberation
startling
bobby
for
this
friend
expressed
practically
the
thought
that
paredes
arrival
had
driven
into
his
own
mind
gave
me
the
creeps
too
makes
me
surer
than
ever
that
he
has
an
abominably
deep
purpose
in
using
his
wits
to
hang
on
here
he
suggests
resources
as
hard
to
understand
as
anything
that
has
happened
in
the
old
room
you
confess
bobby
he
had
a
good
deal
of
influence
over
you
an
influence
for
evil
i
liked
to
go
around
with
him
if
that
what
you
mean
is
he
the
cause
of
the
last
two
or
three
months
nonsense
in
new
york
i
wo
blame
carlos
for
that
bobby
muttered
he
influenced
you
against
your
better
judgment
graham
persisted
to
refuse
to
leave
with
me
the
night
of
your
grandfather
death
maria
did
her
share
bobby
said
he
broke
off
looking
at
graham
what
are
you
driving
at
i
been
asking
myself
since
he
came
back
graham
answered
if
there
any
queer
power
behind
his
quiet
manner
maybe
he
psychic
maybe
he
can
do
things
we
do
understand
i
wondered
if
he
had
without
your
knowing
it
acquired
sufficient
influence
to
direct
your
body
when
your
mind
no
longer
controlled
it
it
a
nasty
thought
but
i
heard
of
such
things
you
mean
carlos
may
have
made
me
go
to
the
hall
last
night
perhaps
sent
me
to
the
old
room
those
other
times
now
that
another
had
expressed
the
idea
bobby
fought
it
with
all
his
might
no
i
wo
believe
it
i
been
weak
hartley
but
not
that
weak
and
i
tell
you
i
did
feel
howells
body
move
under
my
hand
do
misunderstand
me
graham
said
gently
i
must
consider
every
possibility
you
were
excited
and
imaginative
when
you
went
to
the
old
room
to
take
the
evidence
it
was
a
shock
to
have
your
candle
go
out
your
own
hand
reaching
out
to
howells
might
have
moved
spasmodically
i
mean
you
may
have
been
responsible
for
the
thing
without
realizing
it
and
the
disappearance
of
the
evidence
bobby
defended
himself
if
it
had
been
stolen
earlier
the
coat
pocket
might
have
retained
its
bulging
shape
we
know
now
that
paredes
is
capable
of
sneaking
around
the
house
no
no
bobby
said
hotly
you
trying
to
take
away
my
one
hope
but
i
was
there
and
you
were
i
know
with
my
own
senses
what
happened
and
you
do
paredes
has
no
such
influence
over
me
i
think
of
it
if
it
so
graham
asked
quietly
why
do
you
revolt
from
the
idea
bobby
turned
on
him
and
why
do
you
fill
my
mind
with
such
thoughts
if
you
think
i
guilty
say
so
go
tell
robinson
so
he
glanced
away
while
the
angry
colour
left
his
face
he
was
a
little
dazed
by
the
realization
that
he
had
spoken
to
graham
as
he
might
have
done
to
an
enemy
as
he
had
spoken
to
howells
in
the
old
bedroom
he
felt
the
touch
of
graham
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
only
working
in
your
service
graham
said
kindly
i
sorry
if
i
troubled
you
by
seeking
physical
facts
in
order
to
escape
the
ghosts
for
groom
has
brought
the
ghosts
back
with
him
do
make
any
mistake
about
that
you
want
the
truth
do
you
yes
bobby
said
even
if
it
does
for
me
but
i
want
it
quickly
i
ca
go
on
this
way
indefinitely
yet
that
flash
of
temper
had
given
him
courage
to
face
the
ordeal
a
lingering
resentment
at
graham
suggestion
lessened
the
difficulty
of
his
position
entering
the
court
he
scarcely
glanced
at
the
black
wagon
there
were
more
men
in
the
hall
rawlins
had
returned
from
the
rug
in
front
of
the
fireplace
he
surveyed
the
group
with
a
bland
curiosity
robinson
sat
near
by
glowering
at
paredes
the
panamanian
had
changed
his
clothing
he
too
was
sombrely
dressed
and
instead
of
the
vivid
necktie
he
had
worn
from
the
courthouse
a
scarf
was
perfectly
arranged
beneath
his
collar
he
lounged
opposite
the
district
attorney
his
eyes
studying
the
fire
his
fingers
on
the
chair
arm
were
restless
doctor
groom
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
talking
with
the
clergyman
a
stout
and
unctuous
figure
bobby
noticed
that
the
great
stolid
form
of
the
doctor
was
ill
at
ease
from
his
thickly
bearded
face
his
reddish
eyes
gleamed
forth
with
a
fresh
instability
the
clergyman
shook
hands
with
bobby
we
need
not
delay
your
cousin
is
upstairs
he
included
the
company
in
his
circling
turn
of
the
head
any
one
who
cares
to
go
bobby
forced
himself
to
walk
up
the
staircase
facing
the
first
phase
of
his
ordeal
he
saw
that
the
district
attorney
realized
that
too
for
he
sprang
from
his
chair
and
followed
by
rawlins
started
upward
the
entire
company
crowded
the
stairs
at
the
top
bobby
found
paredes
at
his
side
carlos
why
do
you
come
i
would
like
to
be
of
some
comfort
paredes
answered
gravely
his
fingers
on
the
banister
made
that
restless
groping
movement
graham
summoned
katherine
one
of
the
men
opened
the
door
of
silas
blackburn
room
he
stepped
aside
beckoning
he
had
an
air
of
a
showman
craving
approbation
for
the
surprise
he
has
arranged
bobby
went
in
with
the
others
automatically
through
the
dim
light
he
catalogued
remembered
objects
all
intimate
to
his
grandfather
each
oddly
entangled
in
his
mind
with
his
dislike
of
the
old
man
the
iron
bed
the
chest
of
drawers
scratched
and
with
broken
handles
the
closed
colonial
desk
the
miserly
rag
carpet
all
seemed
mutely
asking
as
bobby
did
why
their
owner
had
deserted
them
the
other
night
and
delivered
himself
to
the
ghostly
mystery
of
the
old
bedroom
reluctantly
bobby
glance
went
to
the
centre
of
the
floor
where
the
casket
rested
on
trestles
from
the
chest
of
drawers
two
candles
the
only
light
played
wanly
over
the
still
figure
and
the
ashen
face
so
for
the
second
time
the
living
met
the
dead
and
the
law
watched
hopefully
robinson
stood
opposite
but
he
did
look
at
silas
blackburn
who
could
no
longer
accuse
he
stared
instead
at
bobby
and
bobby
kept
repeating
to
himself
i
did
do
this
thing
i
did
do
this
thing
and
he
searched
the
face
of
the
dead
man
for
a
confirmation
a
chill
thought
not
without
excuse
under
the
circumstances
and
in
this
vague
light
raced
along
his
nerves
silas
blackburn
had
moved
once
since
his
death
if
the
power
to
move
and
speak
should
miraculously
return
to
him
now
in
this
house
there
appeared
to
be
no
impossibilities
the
cold
control
of
death
had
been
twice
broken
katherine
entrance
swung
his
thoughts
and
released
him
for
a
moment
from
robinson
watchfulness
he
found
he
could
turn
from
the
wrinkled
face
that
had
fascinated
him
that
had
seemed
to
question
him
with
a
calm
and
complete
knowledge
to
the
lovely
one
that
was
active
with
a
little
smile
of
encouragement
he
was
grateful
for
that
it
taught
him
that
in
the
heavy
presence
of
death
and
from
the
harsh
trappings
of
mourning
the
magnetism
of
youth
is
unconquerable
so
in
affection
he
found
an
antidote
for
fear
even
graham
quick
movement
to
her
side
could
make
her
presence
less
helpful
to
bobby
he
looked
at
his
grandfather
again
he
glanced
at
robinson
as
in
a
dream
he
heard
the
clergyman
say
the
service
will
be
read
at
the
grave
almost
indifferently
he
saw
the
men
sidle
forward
lift
a
grotesquely
shaped
plate
of
metal
from
the
floor
and
fit
it
in
place
hiding
from
his
eyes
the
closed
eyes
of
the
dead
man
he
nodded
and
stepped
to
the
hall
when
robinson
tapped
his
arm
and
whispered
make
way
mr
blackburn
he
watched
the
sombre
men
carry
their
heavy
burden
across
the
hall
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
dull
autumn
air
he
followed
at
the
side
of
katherine
across
the
clearing
and
into
the
overgrown
path
he
was
aware
of
the
others
drifting
behind
katherine
slipped
her
hand
in
his
it
is
dreadful
we
should
feel
more
sorrow
more
regret
she
said
perhaps
we
never
understood
him
that
is
dreadful
too
for
no
one
understood
him
we
are
the
only
mourners
bobby
as
they
threaded
the
path
behind
the
stumbling
bearers
found
a
grim
justice
in
that
also
because
of
his
selfishness
silas
blackburn
had
lived
alone
because
of
it
he
must
go
to
his
long
rest
with
no
other
mourners
than
these
and
their
eyes
were
dry
bobby
clung
to
katherine
hand
if
i
could
only
know
he
whispered
she
pressed
his
hand
she
did
not
reply
ahead
the
forest
was
scarred
by
a
yellow
wound
the
bearers
set
their
burden
down
beside
it
glancing
at
each
other
with
relief
across
the
heap
of
earth
bobby
saw
the
waiting
excavation
in
his
ears
vibrated
the
memory
of
the
harsh
voice
it
deep
enough
another
voice
droned
it
was
soft
and
unctuous
it
seemed
to
take
a
pleasure
in
the
terrible
words
it
loosed
to
stray
eternally
through
the
decaying
forest
bobby
glanced
at
bent
stones
strangled
by
the
underbrush
at
other
slabs
cracked
and
brown
which
lay
prone
half
covered
by
creeping
vines
the
tones
of
the
clergyman
were
no
longer
revolting
in
his
ears
he
scarcely
heard
them
he
imagined
a
fantasy
he
pictured
the
inhabitants
of
these
forgotten
narrow
houses
straying
to
the
great
dwelling
where
they
had
lived
punishing
this
one
bringing
him
to
suffer
with
them
the
degradation
of
their
neglect
so
robinson
became
less
important
in
his
mind
through
such
fancies
the
ordeal
was
made
bearable
a
wind
sprang
up
rattling
through
the
trees
and
disturbing
the
vines
on
the
fallen
stones
later
he
thought
it
would
snow
and
he
shivered
for
those
left
helpless
to
sleep
in
the
sad
forest
the
men
strained
at
ropes
now
they
glanced
at
katherine
and
bobby
as
at
those
most
to
be
impressed
by
their
skill
they
lowered
silas
blackburn
grimly
shaped
casing
into
the
sorrel
pit
it
passed
from
bobby
sight
the
two
roughly
dressed
labourers
came
from
the
thicket
where
they
had
hidden
and
with
their
spades
approached
the
grave
the
sound
from
whose
imminence
bobby
had
shrunk
rattled
in
his
ears
the
yellow
earth
cut
across
the
stormy
twilight
of
the
cemetery
and
scattered
in
the
trench
after
a
time
the
response
lost
its
metallic
petulance
katherine
pulled
at
bobby
hand
he
started
and
glanced
up
one
of
the
men
was
speaking
to
him
with
a
professional
gentleness
you
need
wait
blackburn
everything
is
finished
he
saw
now
that
robinson
stood
across
the
grave
still
staring
at
him
the
professional
mourner
smiled
sympathetically
and
moved
away
katherine
robinson
the
two
grave
diggers
and
bobby
alone
were
left
of
the
little
company
and
bobby
staring
back
at
the
district
attorney
took
a
sombre
pride
in
facing
it
out
until
even
the
men
with
the
spades
had
gone
the
ordeal
he
reflected
had
lost
its
poignancy
his
mind
was
intent
on
the
empty
trappings
he
had
witnessed
he
wondered
if
there
was
after
all
no
justice
against
his
grandfather
in
this
unkempt
burial
the
place
might
have
something
to
tell
him
if
it
could
only
make
him
believe
that
beyond
the
inevitable
fact
nothing
mattered
if
he
were
sure
of
that
it
would
offer
a
way
out
at
the
worst
perhaps
the
happiest
exit
for
katherine
sake
then
doctor
groom
returned
his
huge
hairy
figure
dominated
the
cemetery
his
infused
eyes
beneath
the
thick
black
brows
were
they
seemed
to
penetrate
bobby
thought
then
they
glanced
at
the
excavation
appearing
to
intimate
that
silas
blackburn
earthy
blanket
could
hide
nothing
from
the
closed
eyes
it
sheltered
at
his
age
he
faced
the
near
approach
of
that
inevitable
fact
and
he
did
hesitate
to
look
beyond
bobby
knew
what
graham
had
meant
when
he
had
said
that
groom
had
brought
the
ghosts
back
with
him
it
was
as
if
the
cemetery
had
recalled
the
old
doctor
to
answer
his
presumptuous
question
there
no
use
your
staying
here
the
resonance
of
the
deep
voice
jarred
through
the
woods
the
broad
shoulders
twitched
one
of
the
hairy
hands
made
a
half
circle
i
hope
you
clean
this
up
my
boy
you
ought
to
replace
the
stones
and
trim
the
graves
you
could
blame
them
could
you
if
these
old
people
were
restless
and
tried
to
go
abroad
for
bobby
in
spite
of
himself
the
man
on
whose
last
shelter
the
earth
continued
to
fall
became
once
more
a
potent
thing
able
to
appraise
the
penalty
of
his
own
carelessness
come
katherine
whispered
but
bobby
lingered
oddly
fascinated
supporting
the
ordeal
to
its
final
moment
the
blows
of
the
backs
of
the
spades
on
the
completed
mound
beat
into
his
brain
the
end
the
workmen
wandered
off
through
the
woods
from
a
distance
the
harsh
voice
of
one
of
them
came
back
i
do
want
to
dig
again
in
such
a
place
people
do
seem
dead
there
robinson
tried
to
laugh
that
man
wise
he
said
to
the
doctor
if
paredes
spoke
of
this
cemetery
as
being
full
of
ghosts
i
could
understand
him
the
doctor
deep
bass
answered
thoughtfully
paredes
is
probably
right
the
man
has
a
special
sense
but
i
have
felt
it
myself
the
cedars
and
the
forest
are
full
of
things
that
seem
to
whisper
things
that
one
never
sees
such
things
might
have
an
excuse
for
evil
let
get
out
of
it
robinson
said
gruffly
katherine
withdrew
her
hand
bobby
reached
for
it
again
but
she
seemed
not
to
notice
she
walked
ahead
of
him
along
the
path
her
shoulders
a
trifle
bent
bobby
caught
up
with
her
katherine
he
said
do
talk
to
me
bobby
he
looked
closer
he
saw
that
she
was
crying
at
last
tears
stained
her
cheeks
her
lips
were
strange
to
him
in
the
distortion
of
a
grief
that
seeks
to
control
itself
he
slackened
his
pace
and
let
her
walk
ahead
he
followed
with
a
sort
of
awe
that
there
should
have
been
grief
for
silas
blackburn
after
all
he
blamed
himself
because
his
own
eyes
were
not
moist
back
of
him
he
heard
the
murmuring
conversation
of
the
doctor
and
the
district
attorney
strangely
it
made
him
sorry
that
robinson
should
have
been
more
impressed
than
howells
by
the
doctor
beliefs
they
stepped
into
the
clearing
the
wind
had
dissipated
the
smoke
shroud
it
was
no
longer
low
over
the
roofs
against
the
forest
and
the
darker
clouds
the
house
had
a
stark
appearance
it
was
like
a
frame
from
which
the
flesh
has
fallen
the
black
wagon
had
gone
the
cedars
was
left
alone
to
the
solution
of
its
mystery
paredes
graham
and
rawlins
waited
for
them
in
the
hall
there
was
nothing
to
say
paredes
placed
with
a
delicate
accuracy
fresh
logs
upon
the
fire
he
arose
flecking
the
wood
dust
from
his
hands
how
cold
it
will
be
here
he
mused
how
impossible
of
entrance
when
the
house
is
left
as
empty
as
the
woods
to
those
who
only
go
unseen
bobby
saw
katherine
shoulders
shake
she
had
dried
her
eyes
but
in
her
face
was
expressed
an
aversion
for
solitude
a
desire
for
any
company
even
that
of
the
man
she
disliked
and
feared
robinson
took
rawlins
to
the
library
for
another
futile
consultation
bobby
guessed
katherine
sat
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
thrusting
one
foot
toward
the
fresh
blaze
it
will
snow
she
said
it
is
very
early
for
that
no
one
answered
the
strain
tightened
the
flames
leapt
throwing
evanescent
pulsations
of
brilliancy
about
the
dusky
hall
they
welcomed
jenkins
announcement
that
luncheon
was
ready
but
they
scarcely
disturbed
the
hurriedly
prepared
dishes
and
afterward
they
gathered
again
in
the
hall
silent
and
depressed
appalled
by
the
long
dreary
afternoon
which
however
possessed
the
single
virtue
of
dividing
them
from
another
night
for
long
periods
the
district
attorney
and
the
detective
were
closeted
in
the
library
now
and
then
they
passed
upstairs
and
they
could
be
heard
moving
about
but
no
one
save
graham
seemed
to
care
already
the
officers
had
had
every
opportunity
to
search
the
house
the
old
room
no
longer
held
an
inhabitant
to
set
its
fatal
machinery
in
motion
yet
bobby
realized
in
a
dull
way
that
at
any
moment
the
two
men
might
come
down
to
him
saying
we
have
found
something
you
are
guilty
the
heavy
atmosphere
of
the
house
crushed
such
forecasts
made
them
seem
a
little
trivial
bobby
fancied
it
gathering
density
to
cradle
new
mysteries
the
long
minutes
loitered
doctor
groom
made
a
movement
to
go
why
should
i
stay
he
grumbled
what
is
there
to
keep
me
yet
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
again
and
appeared
to
have
forgotten
his
intention
graham
wandered
off
bobby
thought
he
had
joined
rawlins
and
robinson
in
the
library
the
only
daylight
entered
the
hall
through
narrow
slits
of
windows
on
either
side
of
the
front
door
bobby
watching
these
was
even
with
the
problems
night
brought
to
him
now
glad
when
they
grew
paler
paredes
who
had
been
smoking
cigarette
after
cigarette
arose
and
brought
his
card
table
drawing
it
close
to
him
he
arranged
the
cards
in
neat
piles
the
uncertain
firelight
made
it
barely
possible
to
identify
their
numbers
doctor
groom
gestured
his
disgust
katherine
stooped
forward
placing
her
hands
on
the
table
is
it
kind
she
asked
so
soon
after
he
has
left
his
house
paredes
started
wait
he
said
softly
puzzled
she
glanced
at
him
stay
just
as
you
are
he
directed
there
has
been
so
much
death
in
this
house
who
knows
languidly
he
placed
his
fingers
on
the
edge
of
the
table
opposite
hers
what
are
you
doing
groom
asked
hoarsely
wait
paredes
said
again
then
bobby
scarcely
aware
of
what
was
going
on
saw
the
cards
glide
softly
across
the
face
of
the
table
and
flutter
to
the
floor
the
table
had
lifted
slowly
toward
the
panamanian
it
stood
now
on
two
legs
what
is
it
katherine
said
it
moving
i
can
feel
it
move
beneath
my
fingers
her
words
recalled
to
bobby
unavoidably
his
experience
in
the
old
room
do
do
that
the
doctor
cried
paredes
smiled
if
he
answered
the
source
of
these
crimes
is
as
you
think
spiritual
why
not
ask
the
spirits
for
a
solution
you
see
how
quickly
the
table
responds
it
is
as
i
thought
there
is
something
in
this
hall
have
you
a
feeling
that
the
dead
are
in
this
dark
hall
with
us
they
may
wish
to
speak
see
the
table
settled
softly
down
without
any
noise
it
commenced
to
rise
again
katherine
lifted
her
hands
with
a
visible
effort
as
if
the
table
had
tried
to
hold
them
against
her
will
she
covered
her
face
and
sat
trembling
i
wo
i
paredes
shrugged
his
shoulders
appealing
to
the
doctor
the
huge
shaggy
head
shook
determinedly
i
not
so
sure
i
do
agree
with
you
i
not
so
sure
the
dead
in
this
hall
that
is
why
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
dangerous
play
it
has
shown
us
at
least
that
you
are
psychic
mr
paredes
i
have
a
gift
paredes
murmured
it
would
be
useful
to
speak
with
them
they
see
so
much
more
than
we
do
he
lifted
his
hands
he
waved
them
dejectedly
he
stooped
and
commenced
picking
up
the
cards
the
doctor
arose
i
shall
go
now
he
sighed
i
do
know
why
i
have
stayed
bobby
got
his
coat
and
hat
i
walk
to
the
stable
with
you
he
was
glad
to
escape
from
the
dismal
hall
in
which
the
firelight
grew
more
eccentric
the
court
was
colder
and
damper
and
even
beyond
the
chill
was
more
penetrating
than
it
had
been
at
the
grave
that
noon
uneven
flakes
of
snow
sifted
from
the
swollen
sky
heralds
of
a
white
invasion
no
more
the
doctor
asked
when
he
had
taken
the
blanket
from
his
horse
and
climbed
into
the
buggy
bobby
leaned
against
the
wall
of
the
stable
and
told
how
graham
had
brought
him
back
the
previous
night
from
the
stairhead
to
which
he
had
gone
with
a
purpose
he
did
dare
sound
the
doctor
shook
his
head
you
should
tell
me
that
you
should
tell
any
one
you
place
yourself
too
much
in
my
hands
as
you
are
already
in
graham
hands
maybe
that
is
all
right
but
the
district
attorney
you
sure
he
knows
nothing
of
this
habit
which
seems
to
have
commenced
the
night
of
the
first
murder
no
and
i
think
paredes
alone
of
those
who
know
about
that
first
night
would
be
likely
to
tell
him
see
that
he
does
the
doctor
said
shortly
i
been
watching
robinson
if
he
does
make
an
arrest
pretty
soon
with
something
back
of
it
he
lose
his
mind
he
might
stop
to
ask
as
i
do
as
howells
did
about
the
locked
doors
and
the
nature
of
the
wounds
how
shall
i
find
the
courage
to
sleep
bobby
asked
the
doctor
thought
for
a
moment
suppose
i
come
back
he
said
i
only
one
or
two
unimportant
cases
to
look
after
i
ought
to
return
before
dinner
i
take
graham
place
for
it
time
your
reactions
were
better
diagnosed
i
share
your
room
and
you
can
go
to
sleep
assured
that
you
come
to
no
harm
that
harm
will
come
to
no
one
through
you
i
bring
some
books
on
the
subject
i
read
them
while
you
sleep
perhaps
i
can
learn
the
impulse
that
makes
your
body
active
while
your
mind
a
blank
the
idea
of
the
influence
of
paredes
which
graham
had
put
into
words
slipped
back
to
bobby
he
was
nevertheless
strengthened
by
the
doctor
promise
to
an
extent
the
dread
of
the
night
fell
from
him
like
a
smothering
garment
this
old
man
who
had
always
filled
him
with
discomfort
had
become
a
capable
support
in
his
difficult
hour
he
saw
him
drive
away
he
studied
his
watch
computing
the
time
that
must
elapse
before
he
could
return
he
wanted
him
at
the
cedars
even
though
the
doctor
believed
more
thoroughly
than
any
one
else
in
the
spiritual
survival
of
old
passions
and
the
power
of
the
dead
to
project
a
physical
evil
he
did
care
to
go
back
to
the
hall
it
would
do
him
good
to
walk
to
force
as
far
as
he
could
from
his
mind
the
memory
of
the
ordeal
at
the
grave
the
grim
impending
atmosphere
of
the
house
and
suppose
he
should
accomplish
something
useful
suppose
he
should
succeed
where
graham
had
failed
so
he
walked
toward
the
stagnant
lake
the
flakes
of
snow
fell
thicker
already
they
had
gathered
in
white
patches
on
the
floor
of
the
forest
if
this
weather
continued
the
woods
would
cease
to
be
habitable
for
that
dark
feminine
figure
through
which
they
had
accounted
for
the
mournful
crying
after
howells
death
which
graham
had
tried
to
identify
with
the
dancer
maria
as
he
passed
the
neighbourhood
of
the
cemetery
he
walked
faster
many
yards
of
underbrush
separated
him
from
the
little
city
of
the
dead
but
its
mere
proximity
forced
on
him
as
the
old
room
had
done
a
feeling
of
a
stealthy
and
intangible
companionship
he
stepped
from
the
fringe
of
trees
about
the
open
space
in
the
centre
of
which
the
lake
brooded
the
water
received
with
a
destructive
indifference
the
fluttering
caresses
of
the
snowflakes
bobby
paused
with
a
quick
expectancy
he
saw
nothing
of
the
woman
who
had
startled
him
that
first
evening
but
he
heard
from
the
thicket
a
sound
like
muffled
sobbing
and
he
responded
again
to
the
sense
of
a
malevolent
regard
he
hid
himself
among
the
trees
and
in
their
shelter
skirted
the
lake
the
sobbing
had
faded
into
nothing
for
a
long
time
he
heard
only
the
whispers
of
the
snow
and
the
grief
of
the
wind
when
he
had
rounded
the
lake
and
was
some
distance
beyond
it
however
the
moaning
reached
him
again
and
through
the
twilight
he
saw
as
indistinctly
as
he
had
before
a
black
feminine
figure
flitting
among
the
trees
in
the
direction
of
the
lake
graham
theory
lost
its
value
it
was
impossible
to
fancy
the
brilliant
colourful
dancer
in
this
black
shadowy
thing
he
commenced
to
run
in
pursuit
calling
out
stop
who
are
you
why
do
you
cry
through
the
woods
but
the
dusk
was
too
thick
the
forest
too
eager
the
black
figure
disappeared
in
retrospect
it
was
again
as
unsubstantial
as
a
phantom
the
flakes
whispered
mockingly
the
wind
was
ironical
he
found
his
pursuit
had
led
him
back
to
the
end
of
the
lake
nearest
the
cedars
he
paused
his
triumph
was
not
unmixed
with
fear
a
black
figure
stood
in
the
open
quite
close
to
him
gazing
over
the
stagnant
water
that
was
like
a
veil
for
sinister
things
he
knew
now
that
the
woman
was
flesh
and
blood
for
she
did
not
glide
away
and
the
snow
made
pallid
scars
on
her
black
cloak
he
crept
carefully
forward
until
he
was
close
behind
the
black
figure
now
he
said
you
tell
me
who
you
are
and
why
you
cry
about
the
cedars
the
woman
swung
around
with
a
cry
he
stepped
back
abashed
not
knowing
what
to
say
for
there
was
still
enough
light
to
disclose
to
him
the
troubled
face
of
katherine
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
as
if
she
might
recently
have
expressed
an
audible
grief
you
frightened
me
bobby
without
calculation
he
spoke
his
swift
thought
was
it
you
i
saw
here
before
but
surely
you
did
cry
in
the
house
the
other
night
and
afterward
when
we
followed
carlos
the
tranquil
beauty
of
her
face
was
disturbed
when
she
answered
her
voice
had
lost
something
of
its
music
what
do
you
mean
it
was
you
who
cried
just
now
it
was
you
i
saw
running
through
the
woods
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
again
i
have
not
run
i
i
am
not
your
woman
in
black
if
that
what
you
think
i
happened
to
pick
up
this
cloak
you
seen
it
often
enough
before
and
i
have
cried
she
brushed
the
tears
angrily
from
her
eyes
at
least
i
have
cried
so
any
one
could
hear
me
i
wanted
to
walk
i
hoped
i
would
find
you
i
thought
you
had
come
this
way
so
i
came
too
why
bobby
you
suspecting
me
of
something
but
the
problem
of
the
fugitive
figure
receded
before
the
more
intimate
one
of
his
heart
there
was
a
thrill
in
her
desire
to
find
him
in
the
solitude
of
the
forest
only
the
faintest
gray
survived
in
the
sky
above
the
trees
the
shadows
were
thick
about
them
the
whispering
snow
urged
him
to
use
this
moment
for
his
happiness
it
was
the
thought
of
graham
that
held
him
back
last
night
under
an
equal
temptation
he
might
have
spoken
a
new
element
silenced
him
and
bound
his
eager
hands
his
awakening
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
raised
an
obstacle
to
around
which
there
seemed
to
exist
no
path
i
sorry
let
us
go
back
he
said
she
looked
at
him
inquiringly
what
is
it
bobby
you
are
more
afraid
than
you
have
ever
been
before
has
something
happened
i
know
nothing
of
he
shook
his
head
he
could
increase
her
own
trouble
by
telling
her
of
that
the
woods
seemed
to
receive
an
ashy
illumination
from
the
passage
of
the
snowflakes
katherine
walked
a
little
faster
do
be
discouraged
bobby
she
begged
him
everything
will
come
out
straight
you
must
keep
telling
yourself
that
you
must
fight
until
you
believe
it
the
nearness
of
her
slender
figure
filled
him
with
a
new
courage
obscured
to
an
extent
his
real
situation
he
burst
out
impulsively
do
worry
i
fight
i
make
myself
believe
if
necessary
tell
everything
i
know
in
order
to
find
the
guilty
person
she
placed
her
hand
on
his
arm
her
voice
fell
to
a
whisper
do
fight
that
way
uncle
silas
is
dead
howells
has
been
taken
away
the
police
will
find
nothing
by
and
by
they
will
leave
it
will
all
be
forgotten
why
should
you
keep
it
active
and
dangerous
by
trying
to
find
who
is
guilty
katherine
he
cried
surprised
why
do
you
say
that
her
hand
left
his
arm
she
walked
on
without
answering
paredes
came
back
to
him
paredes
serenely
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
katherine
had
alarmed
the
household
and
had
led
it
to
the
discovery
of
the
successive
mysteries
he
shrank
from
asking
her
any
more
they
left
the
thicket
in
the
open
space
about
the
house
the
snow
had
spread
a
white
mantle
from
it
the
heavy
walls
rose
black
and
forbidding
i
do
want
to
go
in
katherine
said
their
feet
lagged
as
they
followed
the
driveway
to
the
entrance
of
the
court
the
curtains
of
the
room
of
death
they
saw
had
been
raised
a
dim
unhealthy
light
slipped
from
the
windows
across
the
court
staining
the
snow
robinson
and
rawlins
were
probably
searching
again
suddenly
katherine
stopped
she
pointed
what
that
she
asked
sharply
bobby
followed
the
direction
of
her
glance
he
saw
a
black
patch
against
the
wall
of
the
wing
opposite
the
lighted
windows
it
is
a
shadow
he
said
she
relaxed
and
they
walked
on
they
entered
the
court
there
she
turned
and
bobby
stopped
too
with
a
sudden
fear
for
the
thing
he
had
called
a
shadow
was
moving
he
stared
at
it
with
a
hypnotic
belief
that
the
cedars
was
at
last
disclosing
its
supernatural
secret
he
knew
it
could
be
no
illusion
since
katherine
swayed
against
him
the
moving
shadow
assumed
the
shape
of
a
stout
figure
slightly
bent
at
the
shoulders
a
pipe
protruded
from
the
bearded
mouth
one
hand
waved
a
careless
welcome
bobby
first
instinct
was
to
cry
out
to
command
this
old
man
they
had
seen
buried
that
day
to
return
to
his
grave
for
there
was
the
slightest
doubt
the
unhealthy
candlelight
from
the
room
of
death
shone
full
on
the
gray
and
wrinkled
face
of
silas
blackburn
chapter
viii
what
happened
at
the
grave
hello
katy
hello
bobby
you
shown
your
face
at
last
i
hope
come
sober
the
thin
quarrelsome
voice
of
silas
blackburn
echoed
in
the
mouldy
court
the
stout
bent
figure
in
the
candlelight
studied
them
suspiciously
katherine
clung
to
bobby
trembling
startled
beyond
speech
by
the
apparition
they
both
stared
at
the
gray
face
at
the
thick
figure
which
three
days
after
death
they
had
seen
buried
that
noon
in
the
overgrown
cemetery
bobby
recalled
how
doctor
groom
had
reminded
him
that
an
activity
like
this
might
emerge
from
such
places
he
had
suggested
that
the
condition
of
the
family
burial
ground
might
be
an
inspiration
to
such
strayings
yet
why
should
the
spirit
of
silas
blackburn
have
escaped
why
should
it
have
returned
forthwith
to
the
cedars
unless
to
face
his
grandson
as
his
murderer
afterward
bobby
experienced
no
shame
for
these
reflections
the
encounter
was
a
fitting
sequel
to
the
moment
in
the
dark
room
when
he
had
felt
howells
move
beneath
his
hand
he
had
a
fleeting
faith
that
the
void
between
the
living
and
the
dead
had
indeed
been
bridged
then
he
wondered
that
the
familiar
figure
failed
to
disintegrate
and
he
noticed
smoke
curling
from
the
blackened
briar
pipe
he
caught
its
pungent
aroma
in
the
damp
air
of
the
court
moreover
silas
blackburn
had
spoken
challenging
him
as
usual
with
a
sneer
let
us
go
past
katherine
whispered
but
silas
blackburn
stepped
out
blocking
their
way
he
spoke
again
his
whining
accents
held
a
reproach
what
the
matter
with
you
two
you
might
seen
a
ghost
or
maybe
you
sorry
to
have
me
back
did
you
wonder
where
i
was
katy
reckon
you
hoped
i
was
dead
bobby
bobby
answered
he
had
a
fancy
of
addressing
emptiness
why
have
you
come
that
is
what
you
are
to
us
dead
silas
blackburn
chuckled
he
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
tapped
the
tobacco
down
with
a
knotted
forefinger
i
show
you
how
dead
i
am
trying
to
be
funny
ai
you
i
make
you
laugh
on
the
wrong
side
of
your
face
it
cold
here
i
going
in
the
same
voice
the
same
manner
yet
his
presence
denied
that
great
fact
which
during
three
days
had
been
impressed
upon
them
with
a
growing
fear
the
old
man
jerked
his
thumb
toward
the
dimly
lighted
windows
of
the
wing
what
you
got
the
old
room
lighted
up
for
what
going
on
there
i
tried
to
sleep
there
the
other
night
uncle
katherine
sprang
forward
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
with
a
reluctance
as
pronounced
as
graham
when
he
had
touched
howells
body
her
fingers
brushed
his
hand
her
shoulders
drooped
she
clung
to
his
arm
to
bobby
this
resolution
was
more
of
a
shock
less
to
be
explained
than
his
first
assurance
of
an
immaterial
visitor
what
did
it
mean
to
him
was
it
an
impossible
assurance
of
safety
the
old
man
patted
katherine
shoulder
why
what
you
crying
for
katy
always
seems
something
to
scare
you
lately
he
jerked
his
thumb
again
toward
the
lighted
windows
you
ai
told
me
yet
what
going
on
in
the
old
room
bobby
laugh
was
dazed
questioning
they
trying
to
account
for
your
murder
there
his
grandfather
looked
at
him
with
blank
amazement
you
out
of
your
head
no
katherine
cried
we
saw
you
lying
there
cold
and
still
i
i
found
you
you
not
forgotten
katherine
bobby
said
breathlessly
that
he
moved
afterward
silas
blackburn
took
his
hand
from
katherine
shoulder
trying
to
scare
me
what
the
matter
with
you
some
scheme
to
get
my
money
you
slept
in
the
old
room
the
other
night
bobby
asked
helplessly
no
i
did
sleep
there
his
grandfather
whined
i
went
in
and
lay
down
but
i
did
sleep
i
defy
anybody
to
sleep
in
that
room
what
you
talking
about
it
cold
here
this
court
was
always
damp
i
want
to
go
in
is
there
a
fire
in
the
hall
we
light
one
while
you
tell
me
what
ailin
you
he
turned
and
grasped
the
door
knob
they
followed
him
into
the
hall
shaking
the
snow
from
their
coats
paredes
sat
alone
by
the
fire
languidly
engaged
in
the
solitaire
which
exerted
so
potent
a
fascination
for
him
he
did
turn
at
their
entrance
it
was
until
bobby
called
out
that
he
moved
carlos
bobby
tone
must
have
suggested
the
abnormal
for
paredes
sprang
to
his
feet
knocking
over
the
table
the
cards
fell
lightly
to
the
floor
straying
as
far
as
the
hearth
his
hands
caught
at
the
back
of
his
chair
he
remained
in
an
awkward
position
rigid
staring
at
the
newcomer
i
told
you
all
he
whispered
that
the
court
was
full
of
ghosts
silas
blackburn
walked
to
the
fire
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
smouldering
logs
in
this
light
he
had
the
pallor
of
death
the
lack
of
colour
bobby
remembered
beneath
the
glass
of
the
coffin
the
old
man
always
so
intolerant
and
authoritative
was
no
longer
sure
of
himself
why
do
you
talk
about
ghosts
he
whined
i
i
wish
i
had
waked
up
paredes
sank
back
in
his
chair
waked
up
he
echoed
in
an
voice
bobby
took
a
trivial
interest
as
one
will
turn
to
small
things
during
the
most
vital
moments
in
the
reflection
that
twice
within
hours
the
panamanian
had
been
startled
from
his
cold
reserve
waked
up
paredes
repeated
his
voice
rose
at
what
time
do
you
remember
the
time
not
exactly
sometime
after
noon
bobby
guessed
the
object
of
paredes
question
he
knew
it
had
been
about
noon
when
they
had
seen
the
coffin
covered
in
the
restless
cemetery
paredes
hurried
on
how
long
had
you
been
asleep
what
makes
you
ask
that
the
other
whined
i
do
know
it
was
a
long
time
blackburn
voice
rose
complainingly
how
did
you
guess
that
i
never
slept
so
i
dozed
nearly
three
days
but
i
tired
now
tired
as
if
i
had
slept
at
all
paredes
made
a
gesture
of
surrender
bobby
struggled
against
the
purpose
of
the
man
questions
against
the
suggestion
of
his
unexpected
answers
your
idea
is
madness
carlos
he
whispered
this
house
is
filled
with
it
paredes
said
i
wish
groom
were
here
groom
ought
to
be
here
he
coming
back
bobby
told
him
he
should
be
long
now
he
said
before
dinner
time
paredes
stirred
i
wish
he
would
hurry
the
panamanian
said
nothing
more
as
if
he
realized
the
futility
of
pressing
the
matter
before
doctor
groom
should
return
necessary
questions
surged
in
bobby
brain
the
two
that
paredes
had
put
however
disturbed
his
logic
katherine
who
had
spoken
since
entering
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
uncle
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
she
had
the
appearance
of
one
afraid
to
break
a
silence
covering
impossible
doubts
bobby
called
on
his
reason
his
grandfather
stood
before
him
in
flesh
with
the
old
man
in
spite
of
paredes
ghastly
hint
probably
lay
the
solution
of
the
entire
mystery
and
his
own
safety
he
was
about
to
speak
when
he
heard
footsteps
in
the
upper
hall
his
grandfather
glanced
inquiringly
through
the
asking
who
that
up
there
the
sharp
tone
confessed
that
fear
of
the
cedars
was
active
in
the
warped
brain
the
district
attorney
bobby
answered
a
detective
probably
hartley
graham
what
they
doing
here
he
indicated
paredes
what
this
fellow
doing
here
i
never
liked
him
katherine
answered
they
all
come
because
i
thought
i
saw
you
dead
lying
in
the
old
room
we
all
saw
bobby
cried
angrily
and
paredes
nodded
blackburn
shrank
away
from
them
the
three
men
descended
the
stairs
half
way
down
they
stopped
who
is
that
robinson
cried
graham
face
whitened
he
braced
himself
against
the
banister
next
time
district
attorney
paredes
said
you
believe
me
when
i
say
the
court
is
full
of
ghosts
he
walked
in
from
the
court
i
tell
you
they
found
him
in
the
court
silas
blackburn
voice
rose
shrill
and
angry
what
the
matter
with
you
all
why
do
you
talk
of
ghosts
and
my
being
dead
have
i
a
right
to
come
in
my
own
house
you
all
act
as
if
you
were
afraid
of
me
paredes
questions
had
clearly
added
to
the
uncertainty
of
his
manner
katherine
spoke
softly
we
are
afraid
the
others
came
down
robinson
walked
close
to
silas
blackburn
and
for
some
time
gazed
at
the
gray
face
yes
he
said
you
are
silas
blackburn
you
came
to
my
office
in
smithtown
the
other
day
and
asked
for
a
detective
because
you
were
afraid
of
something
out
here
there
no
question
graham
cried
of
course
it
is
blackburn
yet
it
could
be
what
you
all
talking
about
why
are
the
police
in
my
house
why
do
you
act
like
fools
and
say
i
was
dead
they
gathered
in
a
group
at
some
distance
from
him
they
unconsciously
ignored
this
central
figure
as
if
he
were
in
fact
a
ghost
bobby
and
katherine
told
how
they
had
found
the
old
man
a
black
shadow
against
the
wall
of
the
wing
paredes
repeated
the
questions
he
had
asked
and
their
strange
answers
afterward
robinson
turned
to
silas
blackburn
who
waited
trembling
then
you
did
go
to
the
old
room
to
sleep
you
lay
down
on
the
bed
but
you
say
you
did
stay
you
must
tell
us
why
not
and
how
you
got
out
and
where
you
been
during
this
prolonged
sleep
i
want
everything
that
happened
from
the
moment
you
entered
the
old
bedroom
until
you
wakened
that
simple
silas
blackburn
mouthed
i
went
there
along
about
ten
was
it
katy
nearly
half
past
she
said
and
you
frightened
me
he
must
tell
us
why
he
went
why
he
was
afraid
to
sleep
in
his
own
room
graham
began
robinson
held
up
his
hand
one
question
at
a
time
graham
the
important
thing
now
is
to
learn
what
happened
in
the
room
you
not
forgetting
howells
are
you
silas
blackburn
glanced
at
the
floor
he
moved
his
feet
restlessly
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
for
some
loose
tobacco
with
shaking
fingers
he
refilled
his
pipe
except
for
bobby
and
katherine
he
quavered
you
do
know
what
that
room
means
to
blackburns
and
they
only
know
by
hearsay
because
seen
it
was
kept
closed
do
see
how
i
going
to
tell
you
you
need
hesitate
robinson
encouraged
him
we
all
experienced
something
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
cedars
your
return
alone
enough
to
keep
us
from
laughter
all
right
the
old
man
stumbled
on
i
was
raised
on
stories
of
that
room
even
before
my
father
shot
himself
there
later
on
i
saw
katherine
father
die
in
the
big
bed
and
after
that
i
never
cared
to
go
near
the
place
unless
i
had
to
the
other
night
when
i
made
up
my
mind
to
sleep
there
i
tried
to
tell
myself
all
this
talk
was
tommyrot
i
tried
to
make
myself
believe
i
could
sleep
as
comfortably
in
that
bed
as
anywhere
so
i
went
in
and
locked
the
door
and
raised
the
window
and
lay
down
you
sure
you
locked
the
door
robinson
asked
yes
i
remember
turning
the
key
in
both
doors
because
i
did
want
anything
bothering
me
from
outside
they
all
looked
at
each
other
unable
to
forecast
anything
of
experiences
for
both
doors
had
been
locked
when
the
body
had
been
found
granted
life
how
would
it
have
been
possible
for
silas
blackburn
to
have
left
the
room
to
commence
his
period
of
drowsiness
an
explanation
of
that
should
also
unveil
the
criminal
route
in
and
out
the
tensity
of
the
little
group
increased
but
no
one
interposed
the
obvious
questions
robinson
was
right
it
would
be
quicker
to
let
the
protagonist
of
this
unbelievable
adventure
recite
its
details
in
his
own
fashion
paredes
ran
his
slender
fingers
gropingly
over
the
faces
of
several
of
the
cards
he
had
picked
up
when
i
got
in
bed
silas
blackburn
continued
i
thought
i
let
the
candle
burn
for
company
sake
but
there
was
a
wind
and
it
came
in
the
open
window
and
it
made
the
queerest
black
shadows
dance
all
over
the
walls
until
i
could
stand
it
a
minute
longer
i
blew
the
candle
out
and
lay
back
in
the
dark
he
drew
harshly
on
his
cold
pipe
he
looked
at
it
with
an
air
of
surprise
and
slipped
it
in
his
pocket
it
was
the
funniest
darkness
i
did
like
it
you
put
your
hand
out
and
closed
your
fingers
as
if
you
could
feel
it
but
it
was
all
black
either
some
moonlight
came
in
with
the
wind
between
the
curtains
it
was
exactly
yellow
and
it
was
white
after
a
little
it
seemed
alive
and
i
would
look
at
it
any
more
the
only
way
i
could
stop
myself
was
to
shut
my
eyes
and
that
was
worse
for
it
made
me
recollect
my
father
the
way
i
saw
him
lying
there
when
i
was
a
boy
god
grant
none
of
you
will
ever
have
to
see
anything
like
that
then
i
seemed
to
see
katy
father
too
and
i
remembered
his
screams
the
room
got
thick
with
things
like
that
with
those
two
and
with
a
lot
of
others
come
out
of
the
pictures
and
the
stories
i
heard
about
my
family
his
experience
when
he
had
gone
to
the
room
to
take
the
evidence
from
howells
body
became
active
in
bobby
memory
there
i
lay
with
my
eyes
shut
silas
blackburn
went
on
in
his
strange
inquiring
voice
and
yet
i
seemed
to
see
those
dead
people
all
around
me
and
i
thought
they
were
in
pain
again
and
were
mad
at
me
because
i
did
do
anything
i
guess
maybe
i
must
been
dozing
a
little
for
i
thought
he
broke
off
he
raised
his
hand
slowly
and
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
overgrown
cemetery
where
they
had
seen
his
coffin
covered
that
noon
his
voice
was
lower
and
harsher
when
he
continued
i
i
thought
i
heard
them
say
that
things
were
all
broken
out
there
and
and
awful
so
awful
they
could
stay
his
voice
became
defiant
i
ai
going
to
tell
you
what
i
dreamed
it
was
too
horrible
but
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
do
what
i
could
if
i
ever
escaped
from
that
room
i
i
was
afraid
they
take
me
back
with
them
underneath
those
broken
stones
and
you
you
stand
there
trying
to
tell
me
that
they
did
he
paused
again
looking
around
with
a
more
defiant
glare
in
his
bloodshot
eyes
he
appeared
to
be
surprised
not
to
find
them
laughing
at
him
what
the
matter
with
you
all
he
cried
why
ai
you
making
me
out
a
fool
you
seen
something
in
that
room
too
go
on
robinson
urged
what
happened
then
what
did
you
do
blackburn
voice
resumed
its
throaty
monotone
as
he
spoke
he
glanced
about
slyly
suspecting
perhaps
the
watchfulness
of
the
fancies
that
had
intimidated
him
i
realized
i
had
to
get
out
if
they
would
let
me
so
i
left
the
bed
i
went
he
ceased
intimating
that
he
had
told
everything
i
know
robinson
said
but
tell
us
how
you
got
out
of
the
room
for
when
you
when
the
murder
was
discovered
both
doors
were
locked
on
the
inside
and
you
know
how
impossible
the
windows
are
i
tell
you
katherine
said
hysterically
it
his
body
in
the
bed
bobby
knew
her
assurance
was
justified
but
he
motioned
her
to
silence
let
him
answer
robinson
said
silas
blackburn
ran
his
knotted
fingers
through
his
hair
he
shook
his
head
doubtfully
that
what
i
do
understand
myself
that
what
been
worrying
me
while
these
young
ones
have
been
talking
as
if
i
was
dead
and
buried
i
recollect
telling
myself
i
must
go
i
seem
to
remember
leaving
the
bed
all
right
but
i
do
seem
to
remember
walking
on
the
floor
or
going
through
the
door
you
sure
the
doors
were
locked
no
doubt
about
that
rawlins
said
seems
to
me
blackburn
went
on
that
i
was
in
the
private
staircase
but
did
i
walk
downstairs
first
thing
i
see
clearly
is
the
road
through
the
woods
not
far
from
the
station
what
did
you
wear
robinson
asked
i
had
my
trousers
and
jacket
on
under
my
the
old
man
answered
because
i
knew
the
bed
was
made
up
that
what
i
wore
except
for
the
i
reckon
i
must
have
left
that
in
the
room
i
would
have
gone
back
there
for
anything
my
mind
was
full
of
those
angry
people
i
wanted
to
get
as
far
away
from
the
cedars
as
possible
i
knew
the
last
train
from
new
york
would
be
along
about
three
so
i
thought
i
go
on
into
smithtown
and
in
the
morning
see
this
detective
i
been
talking
to
i
went
to
robert
waters
house
i
known
him
for
a
long
time
i
guess
you
know
who
he
is
he
such
a
book
worm
i
figured
he
might
be
up
and
he
would
ask
a
lot
of
silly
questions
being
selfish
like
most
people
that
live
all
the
time
with
books
he
came
to
the
door
and
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
spend
the
night
he
offered
to
shake
hands
that
funny
too
i
did
feel
like
shaking
hands
with
anybody
i
recollect
that
because
i
felt
sort
of
queer
ever
since
going
in
the
old
room
and
something
told
me
i
better
not
shake
hands
paredes
looked
up
the
cards
slipped
from
his
fragile
pointed
fingers
do
you
realize
district
attorney
what
this
man
is
saying
but
robinson
motioned
him
to
silence
let
him
go
on
what
happened
then
that
all
blackburn
answered
except
this
long
sleep
i
ca
make
out
old
waters
did
get
mad
at
my
not
shaking
hands
he
was
too
tied
up
in
some
book
i
guess
i
told
him
i
was
sleepy
and
did
want
to
be
bothered
and
he
nodded
to
the
spare
room
off
the
main
hall
and
i
tumbled
into
bed
and
was
off
almost
before
i
knew
it
paredes
sprang
to
his
feet
and
commenced
to
walk
about
the
hall
tell
us
he
said
when
you
first
woke
up
i
guess
it
was
late
the
next
afternoon
silas
blackburn
quavered
fumbling
with
his
pipe
again
but
it
was
only
for
a
minute
paredes
stopped
in
front
of
robinson
when
he
turned
you
see
it
was
waters
knocking
on
the
door
blackburn
went
on
i
guess
he
wanted
to
know
what
was
the
matter
and
he
talked
about
some
food
but
i
did
want
to
be
bothered
so
i
called
to
him
through
the
door
to
go
away
and
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
again
he
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
again
katherine
said
breathlessly
and
it
was
about
that
time
that
i
heard
the
turning
in
the
old
bedroom
katherine
graham
called
what
are
you
talking
about
what
are
you
thinking
about
what
else
is
there
she
asked
she
thinking
about
the
truth
paredes
said
tensely
i
always
heard
of
such
things
so
have
you
you
read
of
them
if
you
read
at
all
india
is
full
of
it
it
goes
back
to
ancient
egypt
the
same
person
simultaneously
in
two
places
the
astral
body
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
it
the
projection
of
one
self
whether
consciously
or
unconsciously
perhaps
the
projection
of
something
that
retains
reason
after
an
apparent
death
you
heard
him
he
did
seem
to
walk
he
does
remember
leaving
the
room
which
was
locked
on
the
inside
his
descent
of
the
stairs
was
without
motion
as
we
know
it
he
had
gone
some
distance
before
his
mind
consciously
directed
the
movement
of
this
active
image
of
silas
blackburn
while
the
double
from
which
it
had
sprung
lay
apparently
dead
in
the
old
room
you
notice
he
shrank
from
shaking
hands
and
he
slept
until
we
hid
away
the
shell
what
disintegration
and
coming
together
again
has
taken
place
since
we
buried
that
shell
in
the
old
graveyard
if
his
friend
had
shaken
hands
with
him
would
he
have
grasped
emptiness
did
his
normal
self
come
back
to
him
when
the
shell
was
put
from
our
sight
and
he
awakened
these
are
some
of
the
questions
we
must
answer
you
a
fine
imagination
paredes
robinson
said
dryly
his
fat
face
nevertheless
was
bewildered
and
in
the
eyes
surrounded
by
puffy
flesh
smouldered
a
profound
uncertainty
i
wish
groom
were
here
paredes
was
saying
he
would
agree
with
me
he
would
know
more
about
it
than
i
robinson
threw
back
his
shoulders
he
turned
to
rawlins
with
his
old
authority
the
unimaginative
detective
had
stood
throughout
releasing
no
indication
of
his
emotions
but
as
he
raised
his
hand
now
to
an
unnecessary
adjustment
of
his
scarf
pin
the
fingers
were
not
quite
steady
telephone
this
man
waters
robinson
directed
then
get
in
communication
with
the
office
and
put
them
on
that
end
rawlins
walked
away
robinson
apologized
to
silas
blackburn
with
an
uneasy
voice
got
to
check
up
what
i
can
ca
get
anywhere
with
these
things
unless
you
make
sure
of
your
first
facts
i
daresay
waters
story
will
tally
with
yours
blackburn
nodded
graham
cleared
his
throat
now
perhaps
we
may
ask
that
very
important
question
the
day
blackburn
called
at
your
office
in
smithtown
he
told
howells
he
was
afraid
of
being
murdered
according
to
howells
he
said
heart
all
right
it
wo
stop
yet
awhile
unless
it
made
to
so
if
i
found
cold
some
fine
morning
you
can
be
sure
i
was
put
out
of
the
way
i
know
robinson
said
and
that
night
graham
continued
when
he
went
to
the
old
room
he
was
terrified
of
something
which
he
would
define
for
miss
perrine
he
warned
me
not
to
mention
he
gone
there
katherine
put
in
he
told
me
he
was
afraid
afraid
to
sleep
in
his
own
room
any
longer
robinson
turned
what
about
that
mr
blackburn
for
a
moment
bobby
curiosity
overcame
the
confusion
aroused
by
his
grandfather
apparently
occult
return
all
along
they
had
craved
the
knowledge
he
was
about
to
give
them
the
statement
on
which
bobby
life
had
seemed
to
depend
blackburn
however
was
unwilling
the
question
seemed
to
have
returned
to
him
something
of
his
normal
manner
no
use
he
mumbled
going
into
that
a
good
deal
of
use
robinson
insisted
blackburn
shifted
his
feet
he
gazed
at
his
pipe
doubtfully
i
do
see
why
that
did
come
and
seems
it
was
what
i
ought
to
have
been
afraid
of
after
all
all
along
i
ought
to
have
been
afraid
only
of
the
cedars
and
the
old
room
i
been
accused
of
being
unjust
i
do
want
to
do
an
injustice
now
please
answer
robinson
said
impatiently
you
must
answer
graham
urged
i
do
see
that
it
makes
the
slightest
difference
paredes
drawled
what
has
it
got
to
do
with
the
case
as
it
stands
robinson
snapped
at
him
you
keep
out
of
it
do
forget
there
a
lot
you
answered
yet
silas
blackburn
looked
straight
at
bobby
slowly
he
raised
his
hand
pointing
an
accusing
finger
at
his
grandson
if
you
want
to
know
i
was
afraid
of
that
young
rascal
katherine
started
impulsively
forward
in
an
effort
to
stop
him
blackburn
waved
her
away
you
trying
to
scare
me
katy
he
asked
suspiciously
evidently
robinson
commented
to
graham
howells
was
as
dull
as
we
thought
him
go
on
blackburn
why
were
you
afraid
of
your
grandson
maybe
he
can
tell
you
better
than
i
can
the
old
man
answered
see
any
use
raking
up
such
things
anyway
maybe
i
been
pretty
harsh
with
him
anyway
i
knew
he
hated
the
ground
i
walked
on
and
would
be
glad
enough
to
see
me
drop
in
my
tracks
that
is
so
bobby
said
you
keep
quiet
now
you
always
talked
too
much
so
the
old
feeling
survived
go
on
robinson
urged
i
always
been
a
hard
worker
blackburn
whined
and
he
was
a
waster
naturally
we
did
get
along
i
decided
to
make
a
new
will
leaving
my
money
to
the
bedford
foundation
and
i
wrote
him
that
thinking
it
would
bring
him
hot
foot
to
make
it
up
with
me
i
been
nervous
about
him
before
because
i
did
know
what
might
come
into
his
head
when
he
was
on
these
wild
parties
so
i
spoken
to
howells
thinking
i
trip
him
if
he
tried
any
funny
business
when
he
did
come
that
night
i
got
scared
he
knew
i
would
make
the
new
will
until
morning
and
since
i
see
any
man
throwing
all
that
money
away
i
figured
he
guessed
he
could
turn
me
and
would
waste
any
time
talking
when
you
got
a
lot
of
money
and
a
grandson
who
hates
you
you
have
to
think
of
such
things
suppose
i
thought
he
should
come
out
here
drunk
when
i
was
sound
asleep
i
knew
he
had
a
latch
key
and
he
might
sneak
up
to
my
room
before
i
could
even
get
to
the
telephone
or
i
was
afraid
he
might
hire
somebody
you
can
buy
men
for
that
sort
of
work
in
new
york
i
tell
you
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
i
was
sure
he
do
something
you
understand
if
you
lived
in
this
lonely
place
with
all
that
money
and
nobody
you
wanted
to
will
it
to
i
nearly
sent
for
howells
right
then
but
if
nothing
had
happened
i
have
looked
a
fool
i
wanted
you
to
send
for
a
man
katherine
cried
bobby
leaned
against
the
wall
repeating
to
himself
the
words
of
note
which
accused
him
of
having
made
the
very
threat
his
grandfather
had
feared
so
blackburn
rambled
on
i
decided
i
would
sleep
in
my
room
that
night
and
i
picked
out
the
least
likely
place
for
anybody
to
find
me
i
was
more
afraid
of
him
than
i
was
of
the
old
room
but
as
i
told
you
the
old
room
made
me
forget
master
robert
robinson
stepped
to
bobby
side
all
along
howells
was
right
tell
me
what
you
did
with
that
evidence
bobby
turned
away
katherine
tried
to
laugh
graham
beckoned
to
robinson
what
the
use
of
bothering
with
evidence
against
a
suspected
murderer
when
the
murdered
man
stands
talking
to
you
robinson
frowned
helplessly
paredes
sprang
to
his
feet
you
taking
too
much
for
granted
graham
there
was
a
murder
blackburn
was
killed
we
as
many
witnesses
to
that
fact
as
we
have
that
he
come
back
this
man
who
talks
with
us
accusing
bobby
may
not
stay
have
you
thought
of
that
i
have
noticed
something
that
makes
me
think
it
possible
i
have
been
afraid
to
speak
of
it
but
it
makes
me
hesitate
to
say
that
this
man
is
alive
as
we
understand
life
we
have
to
learn
the
nature
of
the
forces
we
are
dealing
with
exactly
how
dangerous
they
are
they
started
at
a
sharp
rap
on
the
front
door
now
who
the
old
man
whined
i
wish
you
would
look
at
me
so
it
makes
me
feel
queer
you
all
crazy
it
probably
doctor
groom
bobby
said
and
stepped
to
the
door
opening
it
it
was
groom
the
huge
man
walked
in
struggling
out
of
his
coat
at
first
the
others
screened
silas
blackburn
from
him
but
he
acknowledged
their
strained
attitudes
the
excitement
that
still
animated
paredes
face
what
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
found
something
district
attorney
robinson
moved
to
one
side
jerking
his
thumb
at
silas
blackburn
the
coat
and
hat
slipped
from
doctor
groom
hand
his
mouth
opened
his
great
body
crept
slowly
back
until
the
shoulders
rested
against
the
wall
he
placed
the
palms
of
his
hands
against
the
wall
as
if
to
push
it
away
in
order
to
assure
further
retreat
always
the
little
infused
eyes
remained
fixed
on
the
man
who
had
been
his
friend
such
terror
was
chiefly
arresting
because
of
the
great
figure
conquered
by
it
blackburn
thrust
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
he
laughed
shakily
that
fellow
groom
will
have
a
stroke
the
doctor
greeting
had
the
difficult
quality
of
a
masculine
sob
silas
blackburn
who
do
you
think
the
other
whined
you
going
to
try
to
frighten
me
out
of
my
skin
too
these
people
are
trying
to
say
i
been
lying
dead
in
the
old
room
hoped
you
have
enough
sense
to
set
them
right
and
tell
me
what
it
all
about
the
doctor
straightened
you
did
lie
dead
in
the
old
room
his
harsh
amazed
tones
held
an
unqualified
conviction
i
saw
you
there
i
helped
the
coroner
make
the
examination
you
had
been
dead
for
many
hours
and
i
saw
you
bolted
in
your
coffin
i
saw
you
buried
in
the
graveyard
you
let
go
to
pieces
the
others
had
as
far
as
possible
recovered
from
the
first
shock
had
done
their
best
to
fathom
the
mystery
but
groom
fear
increased
his
reddish
eyes
grew
always
more
alarmed
silas
blackburn
turned
with
a
quick
frightened
gesture
facing
the
fire
paredes
drew
a
deep
breath
now
you
see
he
said
doctor
groom
shrank
against
the
wall
again
after
a
moment
with
the
motions
of
one
drawn
by
an
outside
will
he
approached
the
figure
at
the
fireplace
then
bobby
saw
and
he
heard
katherine
choked
scream
for
now
that
his
grandfather
back
was
turned
there
was
plainly
visible
on
the
white
of
the
collar
near
the
base
of
the
brain
a
scarlet
stain
and
the
hair
above
it
was
matted
that
what
i
meant
paredes
whispered
graham
moved
back
good
god
robinson
stared
the
fear
had
found
him
too
doctor
groom
touched
blackburn
shoulder
tentatively
what
the
matter
with
the
back
of
your
neck
blackburn
drew
fearfully
away
he
raised
his
hand
and
fumbled
at
the
top
of
his
collar
he
held
his
fingers
to
the
firelight
why
he
said
blankly
i
been
bleeding
back
there
to
an
extent
the
doctor
controlled
himself
sit
down
here
silas
blackburn
he
said
i
want
to
get
the
lamplight
on
your
head
i
ai
badly
hurt
blackburn
whined
i
do
know
the
doctor
answered
heaven
knows
blackburn
sat
down
the
light
shone
full
on
the
stained
collar
and
the
dark
patch
of
hair
at
the
base
of
the
brain
doctor
groom
examined
the
wound
minutely
he
straightened
he
spoke
unsteadily
it
is
a
healed
wound
it
was
made
by
something
sharp
robinson
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
you
getting
beyond
my
depths
doctor
bring
him
up
to
the
old
bedroom
i
want
him
to
see
that
pillow
but
blackburn
cowered
in
his
chair
i
wo
go
to
that
room
again
they
do
want
me
there
i
have
work
started
in
the
cemetery
blackburn
robinson
said
the
man
we
buried
in
the
cemetery
the
man
these
members
of
your
family
identify
as
yourself
died
of
just
such
a
wound
as
the
doctor
says
has
healed
in
your
head
blackburn
cowered
farther
in
his
chair
you
making
fun
of
me
he
whimpered
you
trying
to
scare
an
old
man
no
robinson
said
how
was
that
wound
made
the
crouched
figure
wagged
its
head
from
side
to
side
i
do
know
nothing
touched
me
there
i
remember
i
had
a
headache
when
i
woke
up
why
does
groom
tell
me
why
i
slept
so
long
i
only
know
groom
rumbled
that
the
wound
i
examined
upstairs
must
have
caused
instant
death
paredes
whispered
to
him
the
doctor
nodded
reluctantly
what
do
you
mean
blackburn
cried
you
trying
to
tell
me
i
ca
stay
with
you
he
pointed
to
paredes
that
what
he
said
that
i
might
have
to
go
back
but
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
i
all
right
my
neck
does
hurt
i
alive
i
tell
you
i
alive
i
teach
you
rawlins
returned
from
the
telephone
his
story
straight
he
said
in
his
crisp
manner
i
been
talking
to
waters
himself
says
blackburn
turned
up
about
looking
queer
and
acting
queer
would
shake
hands
just
as
he
says
he
went
to
the
spare
room
and
slept
practically
all
the
time
until
this
afternoon
no
food
waters
could
rouse
him
blackburn
answer
at
all
or
else
seemed
half
asleep
he
made
up
his
mind
to
call
in
a
doctor
this
afternoon
then
blackburn
seemed
all
right
again
and
started
home
robinson
gazed
at
the
fire
what
to
be
done
now
sir
rawlins
asked
find
the
answer
if
we
can
robinson
said
paredes
spoke
as
softly
as
he
had
done
the
other
night
while
reciting
his
sensitive
reaction
to
the
cedars
gloomy
atmosphere
only
now
his
voice
was
groping
call
me
a
dreamer
if
you
want
district
attorney
but
i
have
given
you
the
only
answer
this
man
soul
has
dwelt
in
two
places
robinson
grinned
i
going
slow
on
calling
anybody
names
but
i
have
forgotten
that
there
been
another
crime
in
this
house
howells
was
killed
in
that
room
too
i
would
like
to
believe
he
could
return
as
blackburn
has
blackburn
looked
up
what
that
who
howells
and
as
robinson
told
him
of
the
second
crime
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
again
whimpering
from
time
to
time
his
fear
was
harder
to
watch
might
i
suggest
graham
said
that
howells
is
out
of
the
case
yet
it
would
be
worth
looking
into
by
all
means
robinson
agreed
rawlins
coughed
apologetically
i
asked
them
about
that
at
the
office
howells
was
taken
to
his
home
in
boston
the
funeral
to
be
then
robinson
said
we
confined
for
the
present
to
this
end
of
the
case
the
facts
i
have
tell
me
that
two
murders
have
been
committed
in
this
house
it
is
still
my
first
duty
to
convict
the
guilty
man
graham
indicated
the
huddled
frightened
figure
in
the
chair
you
are
going
against
the
evidence
of
your
own
eyes
i
shall
do
what
i
can
robinson
said
sternly
we
buried
one
of
those
men
this
noon
his
grandson
his
niece
and
those
who
saw
him
frequently
swear
it
was
this
living
being
who
has
such
a
wound
as
the
one
that
caused
the
death
of
that
man
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
see
who
we
buried
the
permits
graham
suggested
i
shall
telephone
the
judge
robinson
answered
and
he
can
send
them
out
but
i
sha
wait
for
hours
doing
nothing
i
am
going
to
the
grave
at
once
a
waste
of
time
paredes
murmured
i
do
understand
silas
blackburn
whined
you
say
the
doors
were
locked
then
how
could
anybody
have
got
in
that
room
to
be
murdered
how
did
i
get
out
robinson
turned
on
paredes
angrily
i
not
through
with
you
yet
before
i
am
i
get
what
i
want
from
you
he
stormed
away
to
the
telephone
no
one
spoke
the
doctor
rumpled
head
was
still
bent
over
the
back
of
silas
blackburn
chair
the
infused
eyes
did
waver
from
the
crimson
stain
and
the
healed
wound
and
blackburn
remained
huddled
among
the
cushions
his
shoulders
twitching
paredes
commenced
gathering
up
his
cards
katherine
watched
him
out
of
expressionless
eyes
graham
walked
to
her
side
rawlins
as
always
phlegmatic
remained
motionless
waiting
for
his
superior
bobby
threw
off
his
recent
numbness
he
realized
the
disturbing
parallel
in
the
actions
of
his
grandfather
and
himself
he
had
come
to
the
cedars
unconsciously
perhaps
directed
by
an
evil
external
influence
on
the
night
of
the
first
murder
now
it
appeared
the
man
he
was
accused
of
killing
had
also
wandered
under
an
unknown
impulse
that
night
was
the
same
subtle
control
responsible
in
both
cases
was
there
at
the
cedars
a
force
that
defied
physical
laws
moving
its
inhabitants
like
puppets
for
special
aims
of
its
own
yet
he
recalled
there
was
something
here
friendly
to
him
after
the
movement
of
howells
body
and
the
disappearance
of
the
evidence
the
return
of
silas
blackburn
stripped
robinson
threats
of
power
and
seemed
to
place
the
solution
beyond
the
district
attorney
trivial
reach
the
silence
and
the
delay
increased
their
weight
upon
the
little
group
silas
blackburn
huddled
in
his
chair
was
grayer
more
haggard
than
he
had
been
at
first
he
appeared
attentive
to
an
expected
summons
he
seemed
fighting
the
idea
of
going
back
the
proximity
of
graham
to
katherine
quieted
the
turmoil
of
thoughts
if
he
could
only
have
foreseen
this
return
he
would
have
listened
to
the
whispered
encouragement
of
the
forest
robinson
reappeared
anxiety
had
replaced
the
anger
in
the
round
face
which
one
felt
should
always
have
been
no
more
than
jenkins
will
have
to
help
he
said
silas
blackburn
arose
unsteadily
i
coming
with
you
you
not
going
to
leave
me
here
i
wo
stay
here
alone
he
should
come
by
all
means
paredes
said
in
case
anything
should
happen
the
old
man
put
his
hands
to
his
ears
you
keep
quiet
i
not
going
back
i
tell
you
bobby
did
want
to
hear
any
more
he
went
to
the
kitchen
and
called
jenkins
he
let
the
butler
go
to
the
hall
ahead
of
him
in
order
that
he
might
not
have
to
witness
this
new
greeting
but
jenkins
cry
came
back
to
him
and
when
he
reached
the
hall
he
saw
that
the
man
terror
had
not
diminished
they
went
through
the
court
and
around
the
house
to
the
stable
where
they
found
spades
and
shovels
their
grim
purpose
holding
them
silent
they
crossed
the
clearing
and
entered
the
pathway
that
had
been
freshly
blazed
that
day
for
the
passage
of
the
men
in
black
the
snow
was
quite
deep
it
still
drifted
down
it
filled
the
woods
with
a
wan
unnatural
radiance
without
really
illuminating
the
sooty
masses
of
the
trees
it
made
the
night
white
silas
blackburn
stumbled
in
the
van
with
paredes
and
robinson
the
doctor
and
rawlins
followed
graham
was
with
katherine
behind
them
bobby
walked
last
fighting
an
instinct
to
linger
to
avoid
whatever
they
might
find
beneath
the
white
blanket
of
the
little
intimate
burial
ground
groom
turned
and
spoke
to
graham
katherine
waited
for
bobby
and
the
white
night
closed
swiftly
about
them
whispering
until
the
shuffling
of
the
others
became
inaudible
was
she
glad
of
this
solitude
had
she
sought
it
her
extraordinary
request
in
that
earlier
solitude
came
to
him
and
he
spoke
of
it
while
he
tried
to
control
his
emotions
while
he
sought
to
mould
the
next
few
minutes
reasonably
and
justly
why
did
you
tell
me
to
make
no
attempt
to
find
the
guilty
person
because
she
answered
you
were
too
sure
it
was
yourself
why
bobby
did
you
think
i
was
the
the
woman
in
black
that
has
hurt
me
i
did
mean
to
hurt
you
he
said
but
there
is
something
i
must
tell
you
now
that
may
hurt
you
a
little
and
he
explained
how
graham
had
awakened
him
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
you
right
he
said
i
was
sure
then
it
was
myself
in
spite
of
howells
movement
it
followed
so
neatly
on
the
handkerchief
and
the
footmarks
but
now
he
has
come
back
and
it
changes
everything
so
i
can
tell
you
he
could
be
sure
whether
it
was
the
cold
white
loneliness
through
which
they
paced
or
what
he
had
just
said
that
made
her
tremble
perhaps
i
should
have
told
you
that
i
am
glad
she
answered
you
must
never
close
your
confidence
to
me
again
why
have
you
done
it
these
last
few
months
i
want
to
know
calculation
died
then
you
shall
know
through
the
white
night
his
hands
reached
for
her
found
her
drew
her
close
the
moment
was
too
masterful
for
him
to
mould
he
became
instead
plastic
in
its
white
and
stealthy
grasp
i
could
stay
he
said
and
see
you
give
yourself
to
hartley
she
raised
her
hands
to
his
shoulders
he
barely
caught
her
whisper
because
of
the
sly
communicativeness
of
the
snow
i
am
glad
but
why
did
you
say
so
then
the
intoxication
faded
the
enterprise
ahead
gave
to
their
joy
a
fugitive
quality
moreover
with
her
very
surrender
came
to
him
a
great
misgiving
but
you
and
hartley
i
watched
it
been
forced
on
me
then
you
have
misunderstood
she
answered
you
put
me
too
completely
out
of
your
life
after
our
quarrel
that
was
about
hartley
you
were
too
jealous
but
it
was
my
fault
hartley
he
asked
spoke
to
you
about
that
time
yes
and
i
told
him
he
was
a
very
dear
friend
and
he
was
kind
enough
to
accept
that
and
not
to
go
away
his
measure
of
the
widening
of
the
rift
between
them
made
her
more
precious
because
of
its
affectionate
human
quality
she
had
been
kinder
to
graham
more
mysterious
about
him
to
draw
bobby
back
yet
ever
since
his
arrival
at
the
cedars
graham
had
assumed
toward
katherine
an
attitude
scarcely
to
be
limited
by
friendship
he
had
done
what
he
had
in
bobby
service
clearly
enough
for
her
sake
for
a
long
time
past
indeed
in
speaking
of
her
graham
always
seemed
to
discuss
the
woman
he
expected
to
marry
you
are
quite
sure
he
asked
puzzled
that
hartley
understood
why
do
you
ask
he
has
shown
how
good
a
friend
he
is
he
has
always
made
me
think
bobby
said
that
he
had
your
love
sure
he
guessed
that
you
cared
for
me
in
that
place
at
that
moment
there
was
a
tragic
colour
to
her
coquetry
i
think
every
one
must
have
guessed
it
except
you
bobby
he
raised
her
head
and
touched
her
lips
her
lips
were
as
cold
as
the
caresses
of
the
drifting
snowflakes
we
must
go
on
she
sighed
in
his
memory
the
chill
of
her
kiss
was
bitter
in
the
forest
they
could
speak
no
more
of
love
but
bobby
hand
in
hand
with
her
as
they
hurried
after
the
others
received
a
new
strength
he
saw
as
a
condition
to
their
happiness
the
unveiling
of
the
mystery
at
the
cedars
he
gathered
his
courage
for
that
task
he
would
not
give
way
even
before
the
memory
of
all
that
he
had
experienced
even
before
the
return
of
his
grandfather
even
before
the
revelation
toward
which
they
walked
and
side
by
side
with
his
determination
grew
shame
for
his
former
weakness
it
was
comforting
to
realize
that
the
causes
for
his
weakness
and
his
strength
were
identical
the
subdued
murmur
of
voices
reached
them
they
saw
among
the
indistinct
masses
of
the
trees
restless
patches
of
black
katherine
stumbled
against
one
of
the
fallen
stones
they
stood
with
the
others
in
the
burial
ground
close
to
the
mound
that
had
been
made
that
day
they
have
begun
bobby
whispered
she
freed
her
hand
a
white
flame
sprang
across
the
mound
the
trees
from
formless
masses
took
on
individual
shapes
a
row
of
cypresses
on
which
the
light
gleamed
were
like
sombre
sentinels
guarding
the
dead
the
snow
patches
clustered
on
their
branches
were
like
funeral
decorations
pointing
their
morbid
function
the
light
gave
the
overturned
stones
an
illusion
of
striving
to
struggle
from
their
white
imprisonment
robinson
swung
his
lamp
back
to
the
mound
the
snow
is
heavy
he
said
and
the
ground
is
frozen
it
ought
to
take
long
silas
blackburn
commenced
to
shake
it
a
desecration
of
the
dead
we
have
to
know
robinson
said
who
is
buried
in
that
grave
with
a
spade
jenkins
scraped
the
snow
from
the
mound
rawlins
joined
him
they
commenced
to
throw
to
one
side
staining
the
white
carpet
spadesful
of
moist
yellow
earth
their
labour
was
rapid
silas
blackburn
watched
with
an
unconquerable
fascination
he
continued
to
shake
i
too
cold
i
never
be
warm
again
he
whined
if
anything
happens
to
me
bobby
try
to
forget
i
been
hard
and
do
let
them
bury
me
suppose
i
should
be
buried
alive
suppose
paredes
said
you
were
buried
alive
he
turned
to
bobby
and
katherine
that
also
is
possible
you
remember
the
old
theories
that
have
never
been
disproved
of
the
disintegration
of
matter
into
its
atoms
of
its
passage
through
solid
substances
of
its
reforming
in
a
far
place
i
would
have
to
ask
an
east
indian
that
jenkins
standing
in
the
excavation
broke
into
torrential
speech
robinson
i
ca
work
with
the
light
it
makes
the
stones
seem
to
move
it
throws
too
many
shadows
i
seem
to
see
people
behind
you
and
i
afraid
to
look
nothing
aggressive
survived
in
rawlins
voice
we
can
work
well
enough
without
it
sir
robinson
snapped
off
the
light
the
darkness
descended
eagerly
upon
them
above
the
noise
of
the
spades
in
the
soft
earth
bobby
heard
indefinite
stirrings
in
the
graveyard
at
such
an
hour
the
supernatural
legend
of
the
cedars
assumed
an
inescapable
probability
bobby
wished
for
some
way
to
stop
the
task
on
which
they
were
engaged
he
felt
instinctively
it
would
be
better
not
to
tamper
with
the
mystery
of
silas
blackburn
return
bobby
grew
rigid
there
it
is
again
graham
breathed
a
low
keening
came
from
the
thicket
it
increased
in
power
a
trifle
then
drifted
into
silence
it
was
the
wind
it
was
like
the
moaning
bobby
had
heard
at
the
stagnant
lake
that
afternoon
like
the
cries
graham
and
he
had
suffered
in
the
old
room
seeming
at
first
to
come
from
a
distance
it
achieved
a
sense
of
intimacy
it
was
like
an
escape
of
sorrow
from
the
dismantled
tombs
bobby
turned
to
katherine
he
could
see
her
for
the
darkness
he
reached
out
she
was
not
there
katherine
he
called
softly
her
hand
stole
into
his
he
had
been
afraid
that
the
forest
had
taken
her
under
the
reassurance
of
her
handclasp
he
tried
to
make
himself
believe
there
was
actually
a
woman
near
by
if
not
maria
some
one
who
had
a
definite
purpose
there
robinson
flashed
on
his
light
old
blackburn
whimpered
the
cedars
is
at
its
tricks
again
and
there
nothing
we
can
do
it
was
like
a
lost
soul
katherine
sighed
it
seemed
to
cry
from
this
place
it
must
be
traced
bobby
said
then
tell
me
its
direction
certainly
robinson
challenged
flounder
in
the
thicket
a
waste
of
time
let
us
get
through
here
hurry
rawlins
the
light
showed
bobby
that
the
detective
and
jenkins
had
nearly
finished
he
shrank
from
the
first
hard
sound
of
metal
against
metal
it
came
after
a
moment
the
light
shone
on
the
dull
face
of
the
casket
which
was
streaked
with
dirt
jenkins
rested
on
his
spade
he
groaned
it
occurred
to
bobby
that
the
man
could
have
worked
hard
enough
in
this
cold
air
to
have
started
the
perspiration
that
streamed
down
his
wrinkled
face
it
would
be
a
tough
job
to
lift
it
out
rawlins
said
no
need
robinson
answered
get
the
soil
away
from
the
edges
he
bent
over
passing
a
screw
driver
to
the
detective
take
off
the
top
plate
that
will
let
us
see
all
we
want
jenkins
climbed
out
i
sha
look
i
do
dare
look
silas
blackburn
touched
bobby
arm
timidly
i
been
a
hard
man
bobby
he
broke
off
his
bearded
lips
twitching
the
grating
of
the
screws
tore
through
the
silence
rawlins
glanced
up
lend
a
hand
somebody
groom
spoke
hoarsely
it
is
too
late
to
let
the
dead
rest
robinson
gestured
him
away
graham
paredes
and
he
knelt
in
the
snow
and
helped
the
detective
raise
the
heavy
lid
they
placed
it
at
the
side
of
the
grave
they
all
forced
themselves
to
glance
downward
katherine
screamed
silas
blackburn
leaned
on
bobby
arm
shaking
with
gross
impossible
sobs
paredes
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
light
wavered
in
robinson
hand
they
continued
to
stare
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
the
coffin
was
empty
chapter
ix
bobby
vigil
in
the
abandoned
room
for
a
long
time
the
little
group
gathered
in
the
cemetery
remained
silent
the
lamp
shaking
in
the
district
attorney
hand
illuminated
each
detail
of
the
casket
interior
linings
bobby
tried
to
realize
that
except
for
these
meaningless
embellishments
the
box
was
empty
that
was
what
held
them
all
the
void
the
unoccupied
silken
couch
in
which
they
had
seen
silas
blackburn
body
imprisoned
yet
the
screws
which
the
detective
had
removed
and
the
mass
of
earth
packed
down
and
covered
with
snow
must
have
made
escape
a
dreadful
impossibility
even
if
the
spark
of
life
had
reanimated
its
occupant
and
that
occupant
stood
there
trembling
and
haggard
sobbing
from
time
to
time
in
an
utter
abandonment
to
the
terror
of
what
he
saw
to
bobby
in
that
moment
the
supernatural
legend
of
the
cedars
seemed
more
triumphantly
fulfilled
than
it
would
have
been
through
the
immaterial
return
of
his
grandfather
for
silas
blackburn
was
a
reincarnation
more
difficult
to
accept
than
any
ghost
had
paredes
who
all
along
had
offered
them
a
spectacle
of
veiled
activity
and
thought
grasped
the
truth
at
first
glance
indeed
his
gossip
of
oriental
theories
concerning
the
disintegration
of
matter
its
passage
through
solid
substances
its
reassembly
in
far
places
seemed
thoroughly
justified
yet
granted
that
who
in
the
semblance
of
silas
blackburn
had
they
buried
to
vanish
completely
who
in
the
semblance
of
silas
blackburn
had
drowsed
without
food
for
three
days
in
the
house
at
smithtown
the
old
man
stretched
his
shaking
hands
to
bobby
and
katherine
do
let
them
bury
me
again
they
never
buried
me
i
not
been
dead
i
tell
you
i
not
been
dead
he
mouthed
horribly
i
alive
you
see
i
alive
he
broke
down
and
covered
his
face
jenkins
sank
on
the
heap
of
earth
i
saw
you
silas
in
that
box
and
i
saw
you
on
the
bed
miss
katherine
and
i
found
you
we
had
to
break
the
door
you
looked
so
peaceful
we
thought
you
were
asleep
but
when
we
touched
you
you
were
cold
no
no
no
blackburn
grimaced
i
was
cold
i
could
have
been
there
no
question
bobby
said
hoarsely
no
question
robinson
repeated
katherine
shrank
from
her
uncle
as
he
had
shrunk
from
her
in
the
library
the
night
of
the
murder
what
do
you
make
of
it
the
district
attorney
asked
rawlins
the
detective
who
had
remained
crouched
at
the
side
of
the
grave
arose
brushing
the
dirt
from
his
hands
shaking
his
head
what
is
one
to
make
of
it
sir
paredes
spoke
softly
to
graham
the
cedars
wants
to
be
left
alone
to
the
dead
we
would
all
be
better
away
from
it
you
wo
go
yet
awhile
robinson
said
gruffly
do
forget
still
under
bond
the
detail
no
longer
seemed
of
importance
to
bobby
the
mystery
centreing
in
the
empty
grave
was
apparently
inexplicable
he
experienced
a
great
pity
for
his
grandfather
and
recalling
that
strengthening
moment
with
katherine
he
made
up
his
mind
that
there
was
only
one
course
for
him
it
might
be
dangerous
in
itself
yet
on
the
other
hand
he
could
go
to
katherine
while
his
share
in
the
mystery
of
the
cedars
remained
so
darkly
shadowed
he
had
no
right
to
withhold
anything
and
he
would
ask
graham
advice
he
had
stepped
all
at
once
into
the
mastery
of
his
own
destiny
he
would
tell
robinson
therefore
everything
he
knew
from
the
party
with
maria
and
paredes
in
new
york
through
his
unconscious
wanderings
around
the
house
on
the
night
of
the
first
murder
to
the
moment
when
graham
had
stopped
his
somnambulistic
excursion
down
the
stairs
robinson
turned
his
light
away
from
the
grave
there
nothing
more
to
do
here
let
us
go
back
the
little
party
straggled
through
the
snow
to
the
house
the
hall
fire
smouldered
as
pleasantly
as
it
had
done
before
they
had
set
forth
yet
an
interminable
period
seemed
to
have
elapsed
silas
blackburn
went
close
to
the
fire
he
sank
in
a
chair
trembling
i
so
cold
he
whined
i
never
been
so
cold
what
is
the
matter
with
me
for
god
sake
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
katherine
if
if
nothing
happens
we
close
the
cedars
we
go
to
the
city
where
there
are
lots
of
lights
if
you
only
listened
to
bobby
and
me
and
gone
long
ago
she
said
robinson
stared
at
the
fire
i
about
beaten
he
muttered
wearily
rawlins
with
an
air
of
stealth
walked
upstairs
graham
after
a
moment
hesitation
followed
him
bobby
wondered
why
they
went
he
caught
robinson
eye
he
indicated
he
would
like
to
speak
to
him
in
the
library
as
he
left
the
hall
he
saw
paredes
who
had
not
removed
his
hat
or
coat
start
for
the
front
door
where
are
you
going
he
heard
robinson
demand
paredes
reply
came
glibly
only
to
walk
up
and
down
in
the
court
the
house
oppresses
me
more
than
ever
i
feel
with
blackburn
that
it
is
no
place
to
stay
and
while
he
talked
with
robinson
in
the
library
bobby
caught
at
times
the
crunching
of
paredes
feet
in
the
court
why
does
that
court
draw
him
robinson
asked
why
does
he
keep
repeating
that
it
is
full
of
ghosts
he
ca
be
trying
to
scare
us
with
that
now
but
bobby
did
answer
i
come
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
burst
out
everything
i
know
you
may
lock
me
up
even
that
would
be
better
than
this
uncertainty
i
must
have
an
answer
if
it
condemns
me
and
how
could
i
have
had
anything
to
do
with
what
has
happened
he
withheld
nothing
robinson
listened
with
an
intent
interest
at
the
end
he
said
not
unkindly
if
the
evidence
and
howells
report
had
disappeared
i
have
arrested
you
and
considered
the
case
closed
before
this
miracle
was
thrown
at
me
you
involved
yourself
so
frankly
that
i
do
believe
you
lying
about
what
went
on
in
the
old
room
when
you
entered
to
steal
those
exhibits
ca
say
i
blame
you
for
trying
that
either
you
were
in
a
pretty
bad
position
an
position
you
still
are
for
that
matter
but
the
case
is
put
on
such
an
extraordinary
basis
by
what
has
happened
that
i
be
a
fool
to
lock
you
up
on
such
a
confession
i
believe
there
a
good
deal
more
in
what
has
gone
on
in
that
room
and
in
the
return
of
your
grandfather
than
you
can
account
for
thanks
bobby
said
i
hoped
you
take
it
this
way
for
if
you
will
let
me
help
i
have
a
plan
he
turned
restlessly
to
the
door
of
the
private
staircase
in
his
memory
howells
bold
figure
was
outlined
there
but
now
the
face
with
its
slow
smile
seemed
sympathetic
rather
than
challenging
what
your
plan
robinson
asked
bobby
forced
himself
to
speak
deliberately
steadily
to
go
for
the
night
alone
to
the
old
room
as
howells
did
robinson
whistled
did
believe
you
had
that
much
nerve
two
men
have
tried
that
what
good
would
it
do
if
the
answer
anywhere
bobby
said
it
must
be
hidden
in
that
room
howells
felt
it
i
was
sure
of
it
when
i
was
prevented
from
taking
the
evidence
you
believed
it
i
think
there
is
something
strange
and
unhealthy
about
the
room
robinson
agreed
certainly
the
secret
of
the
locked
doors
lies
there
but
had
sufficient
warning
i
not
ashamed
to
say
i
would
take
such
a
chance
i
do
know
that
i
ought
to
let
you
bobby
smiled
i
been
enough
of
a
coward
he
said
and
robinson
i
got
to
know
i
sha
go
near
the
bed
i
watch
the
bed
from
a
corner
if
the
danger
at
the
bed
as
we
suspect
it
probably
wo
be
able
to
reach
me
but
just
the
same
it
may
expose
itself
and
rawlins
or
you
can
be
outside
the
broken
door
in
the
corridor
waiting
to
enter
at
the
first
alarm
howells
had
no
chance
to
give
an
alarm
robinson
muttered
see
later
but
bobby
understood
that
he
would
agree
and
he
forced
his
new
courage
to
face
the
prospect
maybe
something
will
turn
up
robinson
mused
the
case
ca
grow
more
mysterious
indefinitely
but
his
tone
held
no
assurance
he
seemed
to
foresee
new
and
difficult
complications
when
they
returned
to
the
hall
bobby
shrank
from
the
picture
of
his
grandfather
still
crouched
by
the
fire
his
shoulders
twitching
his
fingers
about
the
black
briar
pipe
shaking
groom
alone
had
remained
with
him
bobby
opened
the
front
door
there
was
no
one
in
the
court
paredes
he
said
closing
the
door
has
gone
out
of
the
court
katherine
doctor
she
went
to
the
kitchen
the
doctor
rumbled
i
sure
i
do
know
what
for
this
time
of
night
after
a
little
graham
and
rawlins
came
down
the
stairs
graham
face
was
scarred
by
fresh
trouble
rawlins
drew
the
district
attorney
to
one
side
what
have
you
two
been
doing
up
there
bobby
asked
graham
rawlins
is
graham
answered
in
a
low
worried
tone
he
would
meet
bobby
eyes
he
seemed
to
seek
an
escape
where
katherine
he
asked
doctor
groom
says
she
went
to
the
back
part
of
the
house
why
wo
you
tell
me
what
you
were
doing
only
keeping
rawlins
from
trying
to
make
more
mischief
graham
answered
he
would
explain
are
there
enough
riddles
in
this
house
doctor
groom
asked
with
frank
disapproval
rawlins
and
robinson
joined
them
sparing
graham
a
further
defence
the
district
attorney
had
an
air
of
fresh
resolution
he
was
about
to
speak
when
the
front
door
opened
quietly
framing
the
blackness
of
the
court
they
started
forward
seeing
no
one
silas
blackburn
made
a
slow
shrinking
movement
crying
out
they
opened
the
door
do
let
them
in
do
let
them
come
near
me
again
although
they
knew
paredes
had
been
in
the
court
the
spell
of
the
cedars
was
so
heavy
upon
them
that
for
a
moment
they
did
know
what
to
expect
they
hesitated
with
a
little
of
the
abnormal
apprehension
silas
blackburn
exposed
then
rawlins
sprang
forward
and
bobby
called
carlos
paredes
stepped
from
one
side
he
lingered
against
the
black
background
of
the
doorway
it
was
plain
enough
something
was
wrong
with
him
in
the
first
place
although
he
had
opened
the
door
he
had
been
unwilling
to
enter
shut
the
door
silas
blackburn
moaned
paredes
with
a
quick
gesture
of
surrender
stepped
in
and
obeyed
his
face
was
white
he
had
lost
his
immaculate
appearance
his
clothing
showed
stains
of
snow
and
mould
he
held
his
left
hand
behind
his
back
what
the
matter
with
you
robinson
demanded
the
panamanian
laugh
lacked
its
usual
indifference
when
i
said
the
cedars
was
full
of
ghosts
i
should
have
heeded
my
own
warning
i
might
better
have
stayed
comfortably
locked
up
in
smithtown
silas
blackburn
spoke
in
a
hoarse
whisper
what
did
you
see
out
there
are
they
coming
i
saw
very
little
paredes
answered
it
was
too
dark
you
saw
something
doctor
groom
rumbled
paredes
nodded
he
looked
at
the
floor
a
a
woman
in
black
by
the
lake
bobby
cried
not
as
far
as
the
lake
it
was
near
the
empty
grave
silas
blackburn
commenced
to
shake
again
the
doctor
little
eyes
were
wider
it
was
a
woman
a
woman
robinson
asked
if
it
was
a
ghost
paredes
answered
it
had
the
power
of
attack
but
that
as
you
recall
is
by
no
means
unusual
here
that
why
i
come
in
rather
against
my
will
it
seems
strange
but
i
too
have
been
struck
by
a
sharp
and
slender
object
and
i
thought
perhaps
the
doctor
had
better
look
at
the
result
with
a
motion
of
repugnance
he
moved
his
left
hand
from
behind
his
back
and
stretched
it
to
the
light
the
coat
below
the
elbow
was
torn
the
slender
hand
was
crimson
he
tried
to
smile
luckily
it
was
at
the
back
of
my
head
sit
down
doctor
groom
said
waving
robinson
and
rawlins
away
let
me
see
how
badly
he
hurt
there
be
plenty
of
time
for
questions
afterward
paredes
lay
back
in
one
of
the
chairs
and
extended
his
arm
he
kept
his
eyes
closed
while
the
doctor
stooped
examining
the
wound
all
at
once
his
nearly
perpetual
sleeplessness
since
coming
to
the
cedars
had
recorded
itself
in
his
face
his
nerves
at
last
confessed
their
vulnerability
as
he
fumbled
for
a
cigarette
with
his
good
hand
as
he
placed
it
awkwardly
between
his
lips
would
you
mind
giving
me
a
light
bobby
bobby
struck
a
match
and
held
it
to
the
cigarette
thanks
paredes
said
are
you
nearly
through
doctor
i
daresay
it
nothing
doctor
groom
glanced
up
nothing
serious
with
a
little
luck
it
only
torn
through
a
muscle
it
might
have
pierced
the
large
vein
his
forehead
beneath
the
shaggy
black
hair
was
deeply
lined
he
turned
to
robinson
doubtfully
maybe
you
tell
us
robinson
said
what
made
the
wound
no
use
shirking
facts
the
doctor
rumbled
paredes
has
been
wounded
just
as
he
said
by
something
sharp
and
slender
you
mean
robinson
said
by
an
instrument
that
could
have
caused
death
in
the
case
of
howells
and
and
i
wo
have
you
looking
at
me
that
way
silas
blackburn
whined
yes
the
doctor
answered
before
we
go
any
farther
i
want
to
bind
this
arm
there
must
be
an
antiseptic
in
the
house
where
is
katherine
see
if
you
can
find
her
bobby
as
bobby
started
to
cross
the
dining
room
he
heard
the
slight
scraping
of
the
door
leading
to
the
kitchen
he
knew
there
was
someone
in
the
room
with
him
he
touched
a
cold
hand
bobby
katherine
breathed
in
his
ear
he
understood
why
the
little
light
from
the
hall
had
failed
to
disclose
her
when
she
had
come
from
the
kitchen
she
wore
the
black
cloak
against
the
darkness
at
the
end
of
the
room
she
had
made
no
silhouette
when
he
put
his
arms
around
her
and
touched
her
cheek
he
noticed
that
that
too
was
cold
and
the
shoulders
of
the
cloak
were
damp
as
if
she
had
just
come
in
from
the
falling
snow
where
have
you
been
he
asked
looking
outside
she
answered
frankly
i
could
sit
still
i
wondered
if
the
woman
in
black
would
be
around
the
house
then
i
was
afraid
so
i
came
in
doctor
groom
voice
reached
them
have
you
found
her
is
she
in
the
dining
room
without
any
thought
of
disloyalty
bobby
recognized
the
menace
of
coincidence
take
your
cloak
off
he
whispered
leave
it
here
why
while
he
drew
the
cloak
from
her
shoulders
he
raised
his
voice
carlos
has
been
hurt
the
doctor
asked
me
to
find
you
his
simple
strategy
was
destroyed
by
the
appearance
of
rawlins
the
detective
came
directly
to
them
nor
was
the
coincidence
lost
on
him
and
it
was
his
business
to
advertise
rather
than
to
conceal
it
without
ceremony
he
took
the
cloak
from
bobby
he
draped
it
over
his
arm
the
doctor
he
said
to
katherine
wants
a
basin
of
warm
water
some
old
linen
carbolic
acid
if
you
have
it
she
nodded
and
went
back
to
the
kitchen
while
bobby
returned
with
the
detective
to
the
hall
paredes
eyes
remained
closed
where
did
you
get
the
cloak
rawlins
robinson
asked
the
young
lady
rawlins
answered
with
soft
satisfaction
just
wore
it
in
at
least
it
still
wet
from
the
snow
paredes
opened
his
eyes
he
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
black
cloak
he
closed
his
eyes
again
you
could
recognize
the
woman
who
attacked
you
rawlins
said
paredes
shook
his
head
you
forgotten
how
dark
it
is
please
do
ask
me
even
to
swear
that
it
was
a
woman
you
trying
to
say
it
was
flesh
and
blood
blackburn
quavered
paredes
smiled
weakly
i
trying
to
say
nothing
at
all
tell
us
each
detail
of
the
attack
robinson
said
but
katherine
footsteps
reached
them
from
the
dining
room
and
paredes
would
answer
under
those
conditions
robinson
failure
to
press
the
question
was
as
disturbing
as
the
detective
capture
of
the
cloak
paredes
glanced
at
katherine
once
there
was
no
softness
in
her
attitude
as
she
knelt
beside
his
chair
neither
bobby
felt
was
there
the
slightest
uneasiness
with
a
facile
grace
she
helped
the
doctor
bathe
and
bandage
the
slight
wound
a
silk
handkerchief
for
a
sling
the
doctor
suggested
i
wo
have
a
sling
paredes
said
i
would
know
what
to
do
without
the
use
of
both
my
hands
you
ought
to
congratulate
yourself
that
you
still
keep
it
the
doctor
grumbled
bobby
took
the
pan
and
the
bottles
from
katherine
and
rang
for
jenkins
it
was
clear
that
robinson
had
hoped
the
girl
would
go
out
with
them
herself
and
so
give
paredes
an
opportunity
to
speak
this
new
development
made
him
wonder
about
graham
theories
as
to
paredes
if
it
was
maria
who
had
struck
the
man
there
had
either
been
a
quarrel
among
thieves
or
else
no
criminal
connection
had
ever
existed
between
the
two
paredes
however
aping
the
gestures
of
an
invalid
was
less
to
bobby
taste
than
his
satanic
appearance
when
he
had
come
from
the
private
staircase
rawlins
still
held
the
cloak
after
jenkins
had
removed
the
paraphernalia
everyone
seemed
to
wait
it
was
silas
blackburn
who
finally
released
the
strain
katy
where
you
been
with
that
cloak
what
he
doing
with
it
without
answering
she
took
the
cloak
from
rawlins
and
gave
the
detective
and
the
district
attorney
the
opportunity
they
craved
she
walked
up
the
stairs
turning
at
the
landing
her
farewell
seemed
pointed
at
the
panamanian
who
looked
languidly
up
at
her
if
i
wanted
i
shall
be
in
my
room
who
would
want
you
katherine
graham
blurted
out
but
it
was
clear
he
had
caught
the
coincidence
too
and
the
trouble
he
had
confessed
a
little
earlier
was
radically
increased
that
remains
to
be
seen
robinson
sneered
as
soon
as
she
had
gone
now
mr
paredes
i
really
told
you
everything
he
said
i
walked
toward
the
graveyard
at
a
point
very
close
to
it
i
felt
the
presence
of
this
creature
in
black
i
spoke
i
took
my
courage
in
my
hands
i
reached
out
i
touched
nothing
he
raised
his
injured
hand
i
got
this
for
my
pains
what
made
you
go
to
the
graveyard
robinson
asked
suspiciously
there
was
no
mockery
in
the
panamanian
answer
i
have
told
you
the
court
for
me
has
always
been
full
of
ghosts
he
pointed
to
silas
blackburn
it
frightened
me
that
this
man
should
come
back
through
the
court
from
his
grave
with
all
the
evidence
pointing
to
an
astral
magic
i
wanted
to
retrace
his
journey
i
thought
at
the
grave
if
i
were
alone
something
might
expose
itself
that
had
naturally
remained
hidden
in
the
presence
of
so
many
materialistic
human
beings
a
smile
spread
over
rawlins
cold
unimaginative
features
that
sounds
well
paredes
and
there
is
a
lot
about
this
case
that
looks
like
ghosts
but
leave
us
a
few
clues
this
woman
in
black
is
one
of
them
although
she
been
slippery
as
an
eel
it
looks
to
me
as
if
you
went
to
the
grave
to
meet
her
alone
exactly
as
you
went
to
the
deserted
house
to
talk
quietly
with
her
night
before
last
maybe
she
mistook
you
for
one
of
us
snooping
in
the
dark
and
let
you
have
it
if
that
is
so
paredes
said
easily
the
nature
of
my
wound
would
suggest
that
she
is
guilty
of
the
crimes
in
the
old
room
why
not
go
out
and
arrest
her
then
she
might
explain
everything
except
the
return
to
life
of
blackburn
i
afraid
that
rather
beyond
you
in
any
case
but
at
least
find
her
robinson
joined
in
rawlins
laugh
why
go
outside
for
that
paredes
started
you
never
mean
you
bet
we
do
rawlins
said
if
what
i
doped
out
had
been
so
we
have
caught
her
long
before
we
not
blind
and
we
have
missed
the
nerve
with
which
she
helped
the
doctor
fix
you
up
we
have
caught
her
before
because
her
headquarters
have
been
right
in
this
house
all
the
time
you
remember
the
other
night
robinson
you
just
questioned
her
in
the
court
and
had
threatened
to
question
him
too
when
she
came
in
here
ahead
of
us
and
slipped
out
the
back
way
she
must
have
told
him
to
follow
because
they
had
to
talk
undisturbed
by
us
they
went
by
different
roads
to
the
deserted
house
where
a
light
had
been
seen
before
we
happened
to
hit
his
trail
first
and
followed
it
i
guarantee
you
did
see
her
when
you
first
came
in
robinson
shook
his
head
graham
kept
me
busy
and
i
rather
waited
for
your
report
before
pushing
things
i
did
see
her
or
question
her
until
after
graham
and
blackburn
had
started
for
new
york
and
she
could
have
sneaked
in
the
back
way
any
time
before
that
rawlins
said
it
utter
nonsense
graham
cried
rawlins
turned
on
him
see
here
graham
you
been
trying
to
fight
me
off
this
way
all
afternoon
it
wo
do
katy
a
good
girl
silas
blackburn
quavered
with
a
growing
discomfort
bobby
realized
that
when
the
woman
had
cried
near
the
graveyard
he
had
reached
out
for
katherine
and
had
failed
to
find
her
moreover
the
night
graham
and
he
had
heard
the
crying
in
the
old
room
she
had
stood
alone
in
the
corridor
it
was
easily
conceivable
that
the
turn
of
events
after
robinson
arrival
should
have
made
it
necessary
for
conspirators
to
consult
free
from
any
danger
of
disturbance
but
katherine
he
told
himself
was
assuredly
the
victim
of
coincidence
he
could
picture
her
entangled
in
any
of
purposes
her
dislike
of
the
man
was
complete
and
open
but
he
saw
that
rawlins
out
of
the
mass
of
apparently
inexplicable
clues
had
extracted
this
material
one
and
would
follow
it
desperately
no
matter
who
was
hurt
and
robinson
was
behind
him
that
accounted
for
their
frequent
excursions
upstairs
during
the
afternoon
for
rawlins
ascent
as
soon
as
they
had
returned
from
the
grave
they
had
evidently
found
something
to
sharpen
their
suspicions
and
graham
probably
knew
what
it
was
robinson
took
out
his
watch
we
ca
put
this
off
too
late
he
mused
the
detective
at
his
heels
he
walked
to
the
library
bobby
started
after
them
graham
caught
him
and
they
crossed
the
dining
room
together
what
do
they
mean
to
do
bobby
asked
i
have
been
afraid
of
it
since
this
afternoon
graham
answered
i
have
cared
to
talk
about
it
i
had
hoped
to
hold
them
off
they
intend
to
search
katherine
room
i
think
they
believe
she
has
something
important
hidden
there
i
been
wondering
if
they
got
track
of
howells
report
which
we
told
jenkins
to
hide
why
bobby
asked
should
that
involve
katherine
howells
may
have
written
something
damaging
to
her
he
knew
she
was
devoted
to
your
interests
robinson
called
to
them
from
the
library
wo
you
please
come
in
mr
blackburn
bobby
and
graham
continued
to
the
library
they
found
rawlins
gazing
through
the
door
of
the
private
staircase
we
could
go
up
this
way
he
was
saying
and
across
the
old
room
so
that
she
need
suspect
what
is
he
talking
about
bobby
asked
robinson
angrily
you
wanted
to
help
robinson
answered
so
rawlins
and
i
are
going
to
give
you
a
chance
we
are
about
to
search
your
cousin
room
we
hope
to
find
there
an
explanation
of
a
part
of
the
mystery
the
motive
at
least
for
howells
death
perhaps
your
own
exoneration
you
do
anything
to
have
that
would
you
you
said
so
at
her
expense
bobby
cried
you
no
right
to
go
to
her
room
she
incapable
of
a
share
in
such
crimes
do
you
seriously
think
she
could
plan
an
escape
from
the
grave
and
bring
back
to
life
a
man
three
days
dead
give
me
a
human
being
that
caused
death
robinson
answered
and
tackle
the
ghosts
later
you
wrong
if
you
think
i
going
to
quit
cold
because
your
grandfather
looks
like
a
dead
thing
that
moves
about
and
talks
i
sha
give
up
to
that
madness
until
i
done
everything
in
my
power
i
would
be
a
criminal
myself
if
i
failed
to
do
as
rawlins
wishes
if
your
cousin
skirts
are
clear
no
harm
will
be
done
i
acting
on
the
assumption
that
your
confession
was
honest
i
want
you
to
get
miss
perrine
out
of
her
room
i
want
you
to
see
that
she
stays
downstairs
while
we
search
you
already
searched
her
room
not
since
rawlins
robinson
caught
himself
never
mind
that
it
is
necessary
it
should
be
searched
even
you
acknowledge
it
significant
that
all
day
when
she
has
been
downstairs
her
door
has
been
locked
it
only
significant
bobby
flashed
in
view
of
your
treatment
of
her
yesterday
robinson
grinned
that
will
hardly
go
down
rawlins
has
hesitated
to
break
in
instructed
him
to
do
it
now
if
necessary
for
the
last
time
will
you
bring
your
cousin
down
will
you
go
through
and
unlock
the
door
leading
from
the
old
bedroom
to
the
private
hall
so
we
can
get
up
no
bobby
cried
i
would
do
it
if
i
believed
you
were
right
and
i
know
you
wrong
prove
that
we
wrong
clear
your
cousin
by
helping
us
robinson
urged
since
you
so
determined
graham
said
quietly
i
do
it
hartley
what
are
you
thinking
of
of
showing
them
how
wrong
they
are
graham
said
i
tell
her
doctor
groom
wishes
to
speak
to
her
about
blackburn
i
warn
him
to
keep
her
downstairs
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
that
should
give
you
plenty
of
time
robinson
nodded
she
never
forgive
you
bobby
said
it
spying
he
wondered
that
graham
should
choose
such
a
course
so
soon
after
it
had
become
clear
that
katherine
had
never
really
loved
him
it
the
best
way
to
satisfy
them
graham
said
i
have
perhaps
more
faith
than
you
in
katherine
he
left
them
to
carry
out
robinson
instructions
they
waited
at
the
entrance
of
the
private
staircase
i
may
witness
this
outrage
bobby
asked
i
rather
you
did
speak
of
it
in
such
harsh
terms
robinson
smiled
bobby
did
know
what
to
expect
the
whole
thing
might
be
a
trick
of
paredes
in
line
with
his
hints
the
night
of
howells
death
to
involve
katharine
the
quiet
confidence
of
the
two
officials
was
disturbing
what
had
rawlins
seen
after
a
long
time
graham
descended
the
private
staircase
carrying
a
lighted
candle
he
beckoned
and
they
followed
him
back
through
the
private
hall
into
the
wide
and
mournful
bedroom
it
encouraged
bobby
to
see
the
district
attorney
and
the
detective
hurry
across
it
after
all
they
were
really
without
confidence
of
solving
its
ghostly
riddle
what
they
were
about
to
do
he
argued
was
a
last
chance
they
would
find
nothing
they
would
acknowledge
themselves
beaten
when
they
entered
the
farther
wing
he
noticed
that
katherine
door
stood
wide
you
see
he
said
when
i
called
her
graham
explained
she
thought
something
had
happened
to
her
grandfather
she
ran
out
and
forgot
all
about
the
door
robinson
grinned
that
lucky
now
rawlins
bobby
could
bring
himself
to
cross
the
threshold
but
from
the
corridor
he
could
see
the
interior
of
the
room
and
all
that
went
on
there
during
the
next
few
moments
a
candle
burned
on
the
bureau
exposing
the
feminine
neatness
and
delicacy
of
the
furnishings
the
presence
of
the
three
men
was
a
desecration
what
they
were
about
to
do
an
unforgivable
act
of
vandalism
rawlins
went
to
a
work
table
while
robinson
rummaged
in
the
closet
graham
meantime
bent
against
the
footboard
of
the
bed
watching
with
anxious
eyes
bobby
anger
was
increased
by
this
picture
he
resisted
an
impulse
to
run
to
the
stairs
and
call
katherine
up
that
would
simply
increase
robinson
suspicions
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
nothing
he
could
do
rawlins
had
clearly
been
unsuccessful
at
the
work
table
he
glided
to
the
bureau
one
after
the
other
he
opened
the
drawers
fumbling
within
lifting
the
contents
out
replacing
them
with
a
rough
haste
while
futile
rage
increased
suddenly
he
saw
graham
attitude
alter
rawlins
back
stiffened
he
pulled
the
bottom
drawer
altogether
from
the
bureau
and
thrust
it
to
one
side
he
gazed
in
the
opening
come
here
robinson
he
said
softly
robinson
left
the
closet
and
stooped
beside
the
detective
he
exclaimed
graham
went
closer
looking
over
their
backs
you
better
see
bobby
he
said
without
turning
yes
robinson
said
let
me
show
you
how
wrong
you
were
blackburn
let
me
ask
if
you
knew
you
were
wrong
bobby
entered
with
a
quicker
pulse
he
too
stooped
and
looked
in
the
opening
abruptly
everything
altered
for
him
he
wondered
that
his
physical
surroundings
should
remain
the
same
that
the
eager
faces
beside
him
should
retain
their
familiar
lines
against
the
of
the
bureau
where
it
would
fit
neatly
when
the
drawer
was
in
place
lay
a
plaster
cast
of
a
footmark
near
by
was
a
rumpled
handkerchief
that
bobby
recognized
as
his
own
and
the
envelope
containing
howells
report
which
they
had
told
jenkins
to
hide
well
robinson
grinned
i
swear
i
did
know
they
were
there
bobby
answered
you
never
make
me
believe
that
katherine
knows
it
i
guessed
rawlins
said
that
the
stuff
was
hidden
here
ever
since
this
afternoon
when
i
saw
a
small
bundle
sneaked
in
who
brought
it
bobby
took
him
up
robinson
grin
expanded
leave
us
one
or
two
surprises
to
spring
in
court
then
bobby
said
my
cousin
was
in
the
room
when
this
evidence
was
brought
here
i
admit
that
rawlins
answered
but
she
was
far
away
and
she
got
here
before
i
could
investigate
and
she
kept
the
door
locked
ever
since
until
just
now
he
lifted
the
exhibits
out
the
shape
of
the
cast
the
monogram
on
the
handkerchief
cried
out
their
testimony
robinson
grasped
howells
report
and
glanced
over
the
fine
handwriting
after
a
time
he
looked
up
there
the
case
against
you
blackburn
and
at
the
least
your
cousin
an
accessory
but
why
the
devil
did
you
come
to
me
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
because
bobby
cried
i
did
know
anything
about
these
things
being
here
ca
you
see
that
that
the
trouble
robinson
answered
uncertainly
i
think
i
do
see
it
besides
graham
said
you
still
without
the
instrument
that
caused
death
i
expect
to
land
it
in
this
room
rawlins
answered
grimly
he
replaced
the
drawer
and
continued
to
fumble
among
the
clothing
it
contained
all
at
once
he
called
out
and
raised
his
hand
on
the
forefinger
a
tiny
red
stain
showed
how
did
you
do
that
robinson
asked
something
pricked
me
the
detective
answered
maybe
it
was
only
a
pin
but
it
might
have
been
excitedly
he
resumed
his
search
he
took
the
clothing
from
the
drawer
and
threw
it
to
one
side
nothing
remained
in
the
drawer
i
guess
it
must
have
been
a
pin
robinson
said
disappointed
but
rawlins
took
up
each
article
of
clothing
and
examined
it
minutely
his
face
brightened
here
something
stiff
by
gad
i
believe
i
got
it
concealed
in
a
woollen
sack
with
the
slender
shaft
thrust
through
and
through
the
folds
was
a
peculiarly
long
stout
and
sharp
hat
pin
rawlins
drew
it
out
he
held
it
up
triumphantly
now
maybe
we
not
getting
somewheres
that
the
boy
that
did
the
trick
in
both
cases
and
it
what
scratched
paredes
maybe
you
noticed
how
quickly
she
came
upstairs
to
hide
this
when
she
got
in
good
work
rawlins
robinson
said
he
glanced
at
bobby
and
graham
have
either
of
you
seen
this
deadly
thing
before
bobby
would
answer
but
after
a
moment
hesitation
graham
spoke
there
no
point
in
lying
bobby
katherine
knows
nothing
of
this
i
disagree
with
rawlins
if
she
had
been
working
with
paredes
which
is
unthinkable
she
never
have
made
such
a
mistake
she
would
have
struck
him
i
have
seen
her
wear
such
a
pin
if
she
did
cut
him
with
it
rawlins
reasoned
who
else
could
have
got
it
out
of
here
and
put
it
back
when
she
kept
her
door
locked
there
no
getting
around
it
robinson
said
take
charge
of
these
things
rawlins
put
them
in
a
safe
place
what
are
you
going
to
do
bobby
asked
i
afraid
there
only
one
thing
to
do
robinson
answered
i
have
to
arrest
you
both
one
of
you
used
this
pin
in
the
old
room
it
make
much
difference
which
one
you
been
working
together
and
find
out
about
paredes
later
you
making
a
terrible
mistake
bobby
muttered
you
do
know
katherine
or
you
could
suspect
her
of
any
share
in
such
crimes
give
me
until
morning
to
prove
how
wrong
you
are
what
would
be
the
use
robinson
asked
if
you
do
that
i
will
get
the
truth
for
you
the
whole
truth
how
the
room
was
entered
everything
i
swear
it
robinson
only
a
few
hours
let
me
carry
out
my
plan
let
me
offer
myself
to
the
dangers
of
the
old
room
as
howells
and
my
grandfather
did
your
case
is
no
good
unless
you
can
explain
the
miracle
give
us
this
chance
then
in
the
morning
if
nothing
happens
and
you
still
think
i
guilty
lock
me
up
but
for
god
sake
robinson
leave
her
out
of
it
graham
walked
to
the
window
and
flung
it
open
a
violent
gust
of
wind
swept
in
carrying
a
multitude
of
icy
flakes
the
storm
is
worse
he
said
no
one
is
likely
to
try
to
escape
from
this
house
bobby
stretched
out
his
hand
you
ca
expose
her
to
that
rawlins
had
forgotten
the
sense
of
fellowship
sprung
from
the
pursuit
of
paredes
through
the
forest
he
right
robinson
you
could
lock
up
a
dozen
people
you
might
send
them
to
the
chair
without
uncovering
the
real
mystery
of
the
cedars
maybe
he
might
find
something
and
he
be
as
safe
in
that
room
as
in
any
jail
i
know
of
i
mean
one
of
us
would
be
in
the
library
and
the
other
in
the
corridor
outside
the
broken
door
how
could
he
reasonably
get
out
if
there
was
an
attempt
to
repeat
the
trick
we
be
ready
as
for
the
girl
it
simple
enough
to
safeguard
against
her
getting
away
before
morning
as
graham
says
no
one
likely
to
run
far
in
this
storm
anyway
robinson
considered
i
do
want
to
be
hard
he
said
finally
and
i
do
want
to
miss
any
chance
of
cleaning
up
where
poor
howells
failed
he
glanced
at
the
extraordinary
array
of
evidence
the
good
nature
which
one
felt
should
always
have
been
in
his
face
shone
at
last
i
do
believe
you
guilty
as
far
as
you
concerned
it
likely
enough
a
job
i
do
know
about
the
girl
go
ahead
anyway
and
tell
us
if
you
can
how
the
locked
room
was
entered
explain
the
mystery
of
that
old
man
who
looks
as
if
he
were
dead
but
who
moves
around
and
talks
with
us
the
answer
if
it
anywhere
bobby
said
is
in
the
old
room
robinson
nodded
under
the
conditions
it
seems
worth
while
go
on
then
and
clear
your
cousin
and
yourself
if
you
can
you
have
until
daylight
bobby
gratitude
was
sufficiently
eloquent
in
his
eyes
but
he
said
nothing
he
hurried
from
the
room
to
find
katherine
as
soon
as
he
had
stepped
in
the
corridor
he
saw
her
figure
against
the
wall
katherine
he
breathed
i
heard
everything
she
said
he
led
her
to
the
main
hall
where
the
greedy
ears
in
her
bedroom
overhear
them
then
you
suspected
what
they
were
about
he
asked
her
uncle
silas
she
answered
seemed
just
as
he
had
been
when
i
went
upstairs
so
i
wondered
and
i
remembered
i
had
left
my
door
unlocked
then
you
knew
those
things
were
there
her
face
was
white
she
trembled
her
words
came
jerkily
of
course
i
did
i
only
kept
my
door
locked
because
they
had
searched
so
thoroughly
before
it
was
an
humiliation
i
could
bear
to
face
again
you
do
know
he
asked
who
took
that
stuff
from
howells
who
hid
it
in
your
bureau
the
trembling
of
her
slender
body
became
more
pronounced
she
spoke
through
chattering
teeth
bobby
why
do
you
ask
such
things
you
believe
i
am
guilty
as
you
thought
i
was
the
woman
in
black
you
think
now
because
those
things
were
in
my
bureau
stop
katherine
you
wo
answer
me
no
she
said
backing
away
from
him
but
you
are
going
to
answer
me
we
have
come
to
that
point
already
just
an
hour
or
two
of
trust
and
then
this
it
the
cedars
forcing
us
apart
as
it
did
when
we
had
our
quarrel
only
this
time
it
is
definite
do
you
think
i
guilty
of
these
atrocious
crimes
or
do
you
everything
for
us
depends
on
your
answer
and
i
know
whether
you
are
telling
me
the
truth
then
he
said
why
should
i
answer
and
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
close
she
did
cry
but
for
a
moment
she
ceased
trembling
and
her
teeth
no
longer
chattered
my
dear
he
said
even
if
you
had
hidden
that
evidence
i
have
known
it
was
to
protect
me
then
she
cried
a
little
and
for
a
moment
even
in
the
unmerciful
grasp
of
their
trouble
they
were
nearly
happy
the
footsteps
of
the
others
in
the
corridor
recalled
them
katherine
leaned
against
the
table
drying
her
eyes
graham
robinson
and
rawlins
walked
into
the
hall
hello
robinson
said
i
suppose
that
is
an
unfair
advantage
blackburn
still
i
rather
she
had
been
told
he
told
me
nothing
katherine
answered
i
came
back
to
the
corridor
i
heard
everything
you
said
maybe
it
as
well
robinson
reflected
it
certainly
is
if
what
you
heard
has
shown
you
the
wisdom
of
giving
up
the
whole
thing
she
stared
at
him
without
replying
come
now
he
wheedled
you
might
tell
us
at
least
why
you
stole
and
secreted
the
evidence
i
answer
nothing
that
wiser
katherine
graham
put
in
she
turned
on
him
with
a
complete
and
unexpected
fury
the
colour
rushed
back
to
her
face
her
eyes
blazed
bobby
had
never
guessed
her
capable
of
such
anger
his
wonder
grew
that
her
outburst
should
be
directed
against
graham
keep
quiet
she
cried
hysterically
do
speak
to
me
again
i
hate
you
do
you
understand
graham
drew
back
why
katherine
do
she
said
do
call
me
that
the
officers
glanced
at
graham
with
frank
bewilderment
materialistic
mind
did
hesitate
to
express
its
first
thought
must
say
i
always
thought
you
were
sweet
on
the
lady
hartley
bobby
said
you
have
been
fair
to
us
i
do
know
why
she
attacks
me
graham
muttered
his
face
recorded
a
genuine
pain
his
words
bobby
felt
overcame
a
barrier
of
emotion
they
heard
paredes
and
doctor
groom
on
the
stairs
what
this
the
doctor
rumbled
as
he
came
up
i
i
sorry
i
forgot
myself
katherine
said
through
her
chattering
teeth
she
turned
to
robinson
i
am
going
to
my
room
you
need
be
afraid
i
sha
leave
it
until
you
come
to
take
me
truly
i
hope
it
wo
be
necessary
the
district
attorney
answered
she
hurried
away
rawlins
grinned
at
paredes
i
wondering
what
the
devil
you
know
robinson
made
no
secret
of
what
had
happened
in
reply
to
the
questions
of
paredes
and
the
doctor
he
told
of
the
discovery
of
the
evidence
and
of
the
stout
that
had
unquestionably
caused
death
the
man
made
it
clear
enough
however
that
he
did
care
to
have
paredes
know
of
bobby
plan
to
spend
the
night
in
the
old
room
and
rawlins
bobby
and
graham
indicated
that
they
understood
it
quite
absurd
that
any
one
should
think
katherine
guilty
the
doctor
said
to
robinson
this
evidence
and
its
presence
in
her
room
are
details
that
do
approach
the
heart
of
the
mystery
that
to
be
found
only
in
the
old
room
and
i
do
think
any
one
wants
to
tempt
it
again
in
fact
i
not
sure
one
can
learn
the
truth
there
and
live
you
know
what
happened
to
howells
when
he
tried
silas
blackburn
went
there
and
none
of
us
can
understand
the
change
that
taken
place
i
have
been
watching
him
closely
so
has
paredes
we
have
seen
him
become
grayer
we
have
seen
his
eyes
alter
he
sits
shaking
in
his
chair
since
we
came
back
from
the
grave
the
man
if
we
can
call
him
a
man
seems
to
have
shrunk
yes
paredes
said
perhaps
we
should
have
left
him
alone
let
us
go
back
let
us
see
if
he
is
all
right
rawlins
laughed
skeptically
you
not
afraid
he
melt
away
i
not
so
sure
he
wo
paredes
answered
they
followed
him
downstairs
because
of
the
position
of
chair
they
could
be
sure
of
nothing
until
they
had
reached
the
lower
floor
and
approached
the
fireplace
then
they
saw
it
was
as
if
fear
had
been
realized
blackburn
was
not
in
his
chair
nor
was
he
to
be
found
in
the
hall
even
then
with
the
exception
of
paredes
they
would
take
the
thing
seriously
since
the
old
man
was
in
the
hall
since
he
could
have
gone
upstairs
unobserved
by
them
he
must
be
either
in
the
library
the
dining
room
or
the
rear
part
of
the
house
there
was
no
one
in
the
library
or
the
dining
room
and
jenkins
who
sat
in
the
kitchen
still
shaken
by
the
discovery
at
the
grave
said
he
had
moved
for
the
last
half
hour
was
entirely
sure
no
one
had
come
through
from
the
front
part
of
the
house
they
returned
to
the
hall
and
stood
in
a
half
circle
about
the
empty
chair
where
a
little
while
ago
silas
blackburn
had
cowered
mouthing
snatches
of
his
fear
i
not
dead
i
tell
you
i
not
dead
they
make
me
go
back
the
echoes
of
that
fear
still
shocked
their
ears
there
was
a
hypnotic
power
about
the
vacancy
as
there
had
been
about
the
emptiness
in
the
burial
ground
paredes
spoke
gropingly
what
would
we
find
he
whispered
if
we
went
to
the
cemetery
and
looked
again
in
the
coffin
why
should
he
have
come
back
at
all
groom
mused
robinson
opened
the
front
door
you
know
he
might
have
gone
this
way
but
already
the
snow
had
obliterated
the
signs
of
their
own
passage
in
and
out
it
showed
no
fresh
marks
silas
blackburn
has
not
gone
that
way
in
the
body
doctor
groom
rumbled
the
storm
was
more
violent
it
discouraged
the
idea
of
examining
the
graveyard
again
before
morning
robinson
glanced
at
his
watch
he
led
bobby
and
the
detective
to
the
library
then
try
your
scheme
if
you
want
he
said
but
understand
i
assume
no
responsibility
honestly
i
doubt
if
it
amounts
to
anything
you
shout
out
if
you
are
attacked
or
the
moment
you
suspect
any
real
cause
for
fear
rawlins
will
be
in
the
corridor
and
i
be
in
the
library
or
wandering
about
the
house
always
within
call
rawlins
will
guard
the
broken
door
but
be
sure
and
lock
the
other
one
the
two
officers
went
upstairs
with
bobby
graham
followed
you
understand
robinson
said
i
rather
paredes
and
the
doctor
did
suspect
what
you
are
going
to
do
change
your
mind
before
it
too
late
if
you
want
bobby
walked
on
without
replying
you
ca
dissuade
him
graham
said
because
of
what
will
happen
unless
the
truth
is
discovered
in
the
upper
hall
they
found
katherine
waiting
her
endeavours
were
hard
to
face
you
sha
go
there
for
me
bobby
she
said
is
it
clear
i
must
go
in
my
own
service
he
said
trying
to
smile
he
would
speak
to
her
again
he
would
look
at
her
her
anxiety
and
the
affection
in
her
eyes
weakened
him
and
he
needed
all
his
strength
for
at
the
entrance
of
the
dark
narrow
corridor
the
fear
met
him
rawlins
brought
a
candle
and
guided
him
down
the
corridor
graham
came
too
the
detective
locked
the
door
leading
to
the
private
hall
and
slipped
the
key
in
his
pocket
nobody
will
get
through
there
any
more
than
they
will
through
the
other
door
which
i
watch
with
graham
help
he
made
a
quick
inspection
of
the
room
searching
the
closets
and
glancing
beneath
the
bed
and
behind
the
furniture
there
no
one
he
said
preparing
to
depart
i
tell
you
there
no
chance
of
a
physical
attack
his
unimaginative
mind
cried
out
i
tell
you
you
find
nothing
learn
nothing
for
there
nothing
here
to
find
nothing
to
learn
just
the
same
graham
urged
you
call
out
wo
you
bobby
at
the
first
sign
of
anything
out
of
the
way
for
god
sake
take
no
foolish
chances
i
do
want
the
light
bobby
forced
himself
to
say
my
grandfather
and
howells
both
put
their
candles
out
i
want
everything
as
it
was
when
they
were
attacked
rawlins
nodded
and
followed
by
graham
carried
the
candle
from
the
room
and
closed
the
broken
door
the
sudden
solitude
and
the
darkness
crushed
bobby
taking
his
breath
yellow
flames
the
response
of
his
eyes
to
the
disappearance
of
the
candle
tore
across
the
blackness
confusing
him
he
felt
his
way
to
the
wall
near
the
open
window
he
sat
down
there
facing
the
bed
at
first
he
could
see
the
bed
he
saw
only
the
projections
of
his
fancy
stimulated
by
silas
blackburn
story
against
the
black
screen
of
the
night
he
understood
at
last
what
the
old
man
had
meant
the
darkness
did
appear
to
possess
a
physical
resistance
and
as
the
minutes
lengthened
it
seemed
to
encase
all
the
suffering
the
room
had
ever
harboured
but
he
would
close
his
eyes
as
his
grandfather
had
done
it
was
a
defence
to
keep
them
on
the
spot
where
the
bed
stood
while
his
mind
in
spite
of
his
will
pictured
lying
there
still
forms
with
bandaged
heads
he
would
close
his
eyes
even
when
those
fancied
shapes
commenced
to
struggle
in
grotesque
and
impotent
motion
like
ants
whose
hill
has
been
demolished
nor
could
he
drive
from
his
ears
the
echoes
of
delirium
that
seemed
to
have
lingered
in
the
old
room
he
continued
to
watch
the
darkness
until
the
outlines
of
the
room
and
of
its
furniture
dimly
detached
themselves
from
the
black
pall
the
snow
apparently
caught
what
feeble
light
the
moon
forced
through
reflecting
it
with
a
disconsolate
inefficiency
he
could
see
after
a
time
the
pallid
frames
of
the
windows
the
pillow
on
the
bed
and
the
wall
above
it
he
fancied
the
dark
stain
the
depression
in
the
mattress
where
the
two
bodies
had
rested
those
physical
objects
forced
on
him
the
probability
of
his
guilt
then
he
recalled
that
both
men
dead
for
many
hours
had
moved
apparently
of
their
own
volition
and
his
grandfather
had
come
back
from
the
grave
and
then
had
disappeared
leaving
no
trace
and
he
comforted
himself
with
the
thought
that
the
explanation
if
it
came
at
all
must
arise
from
a
force
outside
himself
whether
of
the
living
or
the
dead
because
of
that
very
assurance
his
fear
of
the
room
was
incited
could
any
subtle
change
overcome
him
here
as
it
evidently
had
the
others
could
there
be
repeated
in
his
case
a
return
and
a
disappearance
like
his
grandfather
there
was
as
rawlins
had
said
no
way
in
or
out
for
an
attack
therefore
the
danger
must
emerge
from
the
dead
and
he
was
helpless
before
their
incomprehensible
campaign
the
whole
illogical
abominable
course
of
events
warned
him
to
bring
his
vigil
to
an
end
before
it
should
be
too
late
urged
him
to
escape
from
the
restless
revolt
of
the
dead
who
had
dwelt
in
this
room
and
he
wanted
to
respond
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
corridor
and
confess
to
rawlins
and
robinson
that
he
was
beaten
yet
he
had
begged
so
hard
for
this
chance
that
course
moreover
meant
the
arrest
of
katherine
and
himself
in
the
morning
for
a
few
hours
he
could
suffer
here
for
her
sake
daylight
if
he
could
persist
until
then
would
bring
release
and
surely
it
be
long
now
he
shrank
back
steadily
it
had
grown
colder
in
the
old
room
he
shivered
he
drew
his
coat
closer
about
him
what
temerity
to
invade
the
domain
of
death
as
paredes
had
called
it
to
seek
the
secrets
of
unquiet
souls
he
ceased
shivering
he
waited
tensely
quiet
without
calculation
he
realized
that
the
moment
for
which
he
had
hoped
was
at
hand
the
old
room
was
about
to
disclose
its
secret
but
would
it
permit
him
to
depart
with
his
knowledge
he
forgot
to
call
he
waited
helpless
and
terrified
against
the
wall
he
heard
a
moaning
cry
faint
and
distant
the
voice
they
had
heard
in
the
forest
and
at
the
grave
but
it
was
more
than
that
that
held
him
he
knew
now
what
katherine
had
heard
across
the
court
heralding
each
tragedy
and
mystery
he
caught
a
formless
stirring
yet
on
the
bed
there
was
no
one
fortunately
he
had
not
gone
there
he
tried
to
call
out
realizing
that
the
danger
could
find
him
if
it
chose
but
his
throat
was
tight
and
it
permitted
no
response
his
glance
had
wavered
from
the
wall
above
the
stained
pillow
there
was
movement
there
then
he
saw
a
hand
protruded
from
the
blackness
of
the
panelling
where
they
had
sounded
and
measured
without
success
in
the
ashen
unnatural
light
from
the
snow
the
long
fingers
of
the
hand
were
like
the
feelers
of
a
gigantic
reptile
they
wavered
feebly
and
he
became
convinced
that
the
hand
was
immaterial
that
it
was
unattached
to
any
body
if
that
was
so
it
could
be
the
hand
of
katherine
at
least
he
had
proved
that
robinson
and
rawlins
had
been
wrong
about
her
that
sense
of
victory
stripped
him
of
his
paralyzing
fear
it
loosed
the
tight
band
about
his
throat
he
called
he
could
prove
the
immaterial
nature
of
the
repulsive
hand
wavering
from
the
wall
crying
out
he
sprang
to
his
feet
he
flung
himself
across
the
bed
with
both
of
his
own
hands
he
grasped
the
slender
inquisitive
fingers
which
wavered
above
the
stained
pillow
and
once
more
his
throat
tightened
he
could
cry
out
again
chapter
x
the
cedars
is
left
to
its
shadows
straightway
bobby
repented
the
alarm
he
had
perhaps
too
impulsively
given
for
the
hand
protruding
from
the
wall
was
indeed
flesh
and
blood
and
with
the
knowledge
came
back
his
fear
for
katherine
conquering
his
first
relief
a
sick
revulsion
swept
him
he
remembered
the
evidence
found
in
katherine
room
and
her
refusal
to
answer
questions
could
paredes
and
the
officers
have
been
right
was
it
conceivably
her
hand
struggling
weakly
in
his
grasp
the
door
from
the
corridor
crashed
open
rawlins
burst
through
graham
ran
after
him
from
the
private
stairway
arose
the
sound
of
the
district
attorney
hurrying
footsteps
what
is
it
what
have
you
got
rawlins
shouted
graham
cried
out
you
all
right
bobby
the
candle
which
the
detective
carried
gleamed
on
the
slender
fingers
showing
bobby
that
they
had
been
inserted
through
an
opening
in
the
wall
he
could
understand
for
time
after
time
each
one
of
the
panels
had
been
sounded
and
examined
beyond
he
could
see
dimly
the
dark
clothing
of
the
person
who
with
a
stealth
in
itself
suggestive
of
abnormal
crime
had
made
use
of
such
a
device
as
rawlins
hurried
up
he
wondered
if
it
would
be
the
better
course
to
free
his
prisoner
to
cry
out
urging
an
escape
already
it
was
too
late
the
detective
and
graham
had
seen
and
clearly
they
had
no
doubt
that
he
held
the
one
responsible
for
two
brutal
murders
and
for
the
confusing
mysteries
that
had
capped
them
looks
like
a
lady
hand
rawlins
called
do
let
go
young
fellow
he
unlocked
the
door
to
the
private
hallway
graham
and
he
dashed
out
in
bobby

the
hand
twitched
robinson
voice
reached
him
through
the
opening
let
go
blackburn
you
done
your
share
the
lord
knows
caught
the
beast
with
the
goods
bobby
released
the
slender
fingers
he
saw
them
vanish
through
the
opening
he
left
the
bed
and
reluctantly
approached
the
door
to
the
private
hall
excited
phrases
roared
in
his
ears
he
scarcely
dared
listen
because
of
their
possible
confirmation
of
his
doubt
the
fingers
he
repeated
to
himself
had
been
too
slender
the
moment
that
had
freed
him
from
fear
of
his
own
guilt
had
constructed
in
its
place
an
uncertainty
harder
to
face
yet
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
waiting
sooner
or
later
he
must
learn
whether
katherine
had
hidden
the
evidence
whether
she
had
used
the
stout
and
deadly
hatpin
whether
she
struggled
now
in
the
grasp
of
vindictive
men
a
voice
from
the
corridor
arrested
him
bobby
with
a
glad
cry
he
swung
around
katherine
stood
in
the
opposite
doorway
her
presence
there
beyond
a
doubt
was
her
exculpation
he
crossed
the
sombre
room
he
grasped
her
hands
he
smiled
happily
after
all
the
hand
he
had
held
was
not
as
slender
as
hers
thank
heavens
you
here
in
a
word
he
recited
the
result
of
his
vigil
it
clears
you
she
said
quick
we
must
see
who
it
is
but
he
lingered
for
he
wanted
that
ugly
fear
done
with
once
for
all
you
can
tell
me
now
how
the
evidence
got
in
your
room
i
ca
she
said
i
do
know
the
truth
of
her
reply
impressed
him
he
looked
at
her
and
wondered
that
she
should
be
fully
dressed
why
are
you
dressed
he
asked
she
was
puzzled
why
not
i
do
think
any
one
had
gone
to
bed
but
it
must
be
very
late
i
supposed
it
was
the
same
time
two
she
started
to
cross
the
room
she
laughed
nervously
it
is
eleven
he
recalled
his
interminable
anticipation
among
the
shadows
of
the
old
room
i
watched
there
only
a
little
more
than
an
hour
not
much
more
than
that
bobby
what
a
coward
i
have
sworn
it
was
nearly
daylight
she
pressed
his
hand
no
very
brave
she
whispered
let
us
see
if
it
was
worth
it
they
stepped
through
the
doorway
half
way
down
the
hall
robinson
graham
and
rawlins
held
a
fourth
who
had
ceased
struggling
bobby
paused
yet
since
seeing
katherine
step
from
the
corridor
his
reason
had
taught
him
to
expect
just
this
the
fourth
man
was
paredes
nearly
effeminate
carlos
bobby
cried
you
ca
have
done
these
unspeakable
things
the
panamanian
stared
without
answering
evidently
he
had
had
time
to
control
his
chagrin
to
smother
his
revolt
from
the
future
for
the
thin
face
was
bare
of
emotion
the
depths
of
the
eyes
as
usual
turned
back
scrutiny
the
man
disclosed
neither
guilt
nor
the
outrage
of
an
assumed
innocence
neither
confession
nor
denial
he
simply
stared
straining
a
trifle
against
the
eager
hands
of
his
captors
rawlins
grinned
joyously
you
ought
to
have
a
medal
for
getting
away
with
this
young
fellow
things
did
look
so
happy
for
you
an
hour
or
so
ago
and
i
had
half
a
mind
robinson
confessed
to
refuse
you
the
chance
glad
i
did
glad
as
i
can
be
you
made
good
with
the
egotism
any
man
is
likely
to
draw
from
his
efforts
in
the
detection
of
crime
he
added
easily
of
course
i
suspected
this
spigotty
all
along
i
do
have
to
remind
you
of
that
sure
rawlins
said
and
did
i
put
it
up
to
him
strong
enough
paredes
laughed
lightly
all
credit
where
it
is
due
you
also
put
it
up
to
miss
perrine
the
details
will
straighten
all
that
out
robinson
said
i
pretend
to
have
them
yet
i
gather
not
paredes
mused
with
old
blackburn
ghost
still
in
the
offing
that
talk
rawlins
said
wo
go
down
from
you
any
more
i
daresay
you
got
most
of
the
details
in
your
head
i
daresay
paredes
answered
dryly
he
fought
farther
back
against
the
detaining
hands
is
there
any
necessity
for
this
exhibition
of
brute
strength
you
must
find
it
very
exhausting
you
may
think
me
dangerous
and
i
thank
you
but
i
have
no
gun
and
i
no
match
for
four
men
and
a
woman
besides
you
hurt
my
arm
bobby
was
none
too
tender
with
that
i
ought
to
have
used
my
good
arm
you
get
no
details
from
me
unless
you
take
your
hands
off
robinson
hesitation
was
easily
comprehensible
if
paredes
were
responsible
for
the
abnormalities
they
had
experienced
at
the
cedars
he
might
find
it
simple
enough
to
trick
them
now
but
the
man
mocking
smile
brought
the
anger
to
robinson
face
of
course
he
ca
get
away
see
if
there
anything
on
his
clothes
rawlins
he
ought
to
have
the
hatpin
then
let
him
go
the
detective
however
failed
to
find
the
hatpin
or
any
other
weapon
you
see
paredes
smiled
that
something
in
my
favour
he
stepped
back
brushing
his
clothing
with
his
uninjured
hand
he
lighted
a
cigarette
he
drew
back
the
coat
sleeve
of
his
left
arm
and
readjusted
the
bandage
he
glanced
up
as
heavy
footsteps
heralded
doctor
groom
hello
doctor
he
called
cheerily
i
was
afraid
you
nap
through
the
show
it
seems
the
bloodhounds
of
the
law
left
us
out
of
their
confidence
what
all
this
the
doctor
rumbled
paredes
waved
his
hand
i
am
a
prisoner
the
doctor
gaped
you
mean
you
young
blackburn
caught
him
robinson
explained
he
was
in
a
position
to
finish
him
just
as
he
did
howells
except
that
i
had
no
hatpin
paredes
yawned
the
doctor
uneasy
glance
sought
the
opening
in
the
wall
i
thought
you
had
examined
all
these
walls
he
grumbled
how
did
you
miss
this
robinson
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
that
what
i
been
asking
myself
he
said
i
went
over
that
panelling
a
dozen
times
myself
bobby
and
katherine
went
closer
bobby
had
been
from
the
first
puzzled
by
paredes
easy
manner
he
had
a
quick
hope
he
saw
the
man
watch
with
an
amused
tolerance
while
the
district
attorney
bent
over
examining
the
face
of
the
panel
an
entire
section
robinson
said
the
thickness
of
the
wall
has
been
shifted
to
one
side
no
wonder
we
did
see
any
joints
or
get
a
hollow
sound
from
this
panel
any
more
than
from
the
others
but
why
did
we
stumble
on
the
mechanism
maybe
you
tell
us
that
paredes
the
panamanian
blew
a
wreath
of
smoke
against
the
ancient
wall
gladly
but
you
will
find
it
humiliating
i
have
experienced
humility
in
this
hall
myself
the
reason
you
did
find
any
mechanism
is
that
there
was
any
you
looked
for
something
most
cautiously
concealed
not
realizing
that
the
best
concealment
is
no
concealment
at
all
fundamental
i
do
know
how
it
slipped
my
own
mind
no
grooves
show
because
the
door
is
an
entire
panel
there
is
even
a
latch
you
merely
push
hard
against
its
face
such
arrangements
are
common
enough
in
colonial
houses
and
there
was
more
than
the
nature
of
the
crimes
to
tell
you
there
was
some
such
thing
here
i
mean
if
you
will
examine
the
farther
door
closer
than
you
have
done
you
will
find
that
it
has
fewer
coats
of
paint
than
the
one
leading
to
the
corridor
that
its
frame
is
of
newer
wood
in
other
words
it
was
cut
through
after
the
wing
was
built
this
panel
was
the
original
door
designed
with
the
private
stairway
and
the
hall
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
master
of
the
house
try
it
robinson
braced
himself
and
shoved
against
the
panel
it
moved
in
its
grooves
with
a
vibrant
stirring
rusty
he
said
katherine
started
that
what
i
heard
each
time
she
cried
above
his
heavy
black
beard
the
doctor
cheeks
whitened
robinson
made
a
gesture
of
revulsion
that
gives
the
nasty
game
away
naturally
paredes
said
and
you
must
admit
the
game
is
as
beautifully
simple
as
the
panel
the
instrument
of
death
was
inserted
through
the
bedding
as
you
thought
inevitable
doctor
suppose
you
were
lying
in
that
bed
asleep
or
half
asleep
and
you
were
aroused
by
such
a
sound
as
that
in
the
wall
behind
you
what
would
you
do
what
would
any
man
do
first
of
all
robinson
nodded
i
see
what
you
mean
i
get
up
on
my
elbow
i
look
around
as
quickly
as
i
could
to
see
what
it
was
i
expose
myself
to
a
clean
thrust
drop
back
on
the
bed
more
thoroughly
out
of
it
than
though
i
been
struck
through
the
heart
exactly
paredes
said
with
the
familiar
shrug
of
his
shoulders
you
sensible
to
give
up
this
way
robinson
said
it
the
best
plan
for
you
what
about
mr
blackburn
graham
interfered
after
all
he
said
thoughtfully
i
a
lawyer
and
it
is
fair
robinson
it
only
decent
to
tell
him
that
anything
he
says
may
be
used
against
him
keep
your
mouth
shut
robinson
shouted
but
paredes
smiled
at
graham
it
very
good
of
you
but
i
agree
with
the
district
attorney
no
point
in
being
a
clam
now
can
you
account
for
silas
blackburn
return
the
doctor
asked
eagerly
that
right
doctor
paredes
said
stick
to
the
ghosts
i
fancy
there
are
plenty
in
this
house
i
afraid
we
must
look
on
silas
blackburn
as
dead
you
do
mean
we
been
talking
to
a
dead
man
katherine
whispered
before
i
answer
paredes
said
i
want
to
have
one
or
two
things
straight
these
men
bobby
i
really
believe
think
me
capable
of
the
crimes
in
this
house
i
want
to
know
if
you
accept
such
a
theory
do
you
think
i
had
any
idea
of
killing
you
bobby
studied
the
reserved
face
which
even
now
was
without
emotion
i
ca
think
anything
of
the
kind
he
said
softly
that
very
nice
paredes
said
if
you
had
answered
differently
have
let
these
clever
policemen
lay
their
own
ghosts
he
turned
to
robinson
even
you
must
begin
to
see
that
i
not
guilty
your
common
sense
will
tell
you
so
if
i
had
been
planning
to
kill
bobby
why
did
i
bring
the
weapon
why
did
i
put
my
hand
through
the
opening
before
i
was
ready
to
strike
why
did
i
use
my
left
hand
my
injured
hand
i
was
like
howells
i
could
consider
the
case
finished
until
i
had
solved
the
mystery
of
the
locked
doors
i
supposed
the
room
was
empty
when
i
found
the
secret
i
reached
through
to
see
how
far
my
hand
would
be
from
the
pillow
bobby
assurance
of
paredes
innocence
clouded
his
own
situation
made
it
in
a
sense
more
dangerous
than
it
had
ever
been
his
wanderings
about
the
cedars
remained
unexplained
and
they
knew
now
it
had
never
been
necessary
for
the
murderer
to
enter
the
room
katherine
too
evidently
realized
the
menace
do
you
think
i
she
began
paredes
bowed
you
dislike
me
miss
katherine
but
do
be
afraid
for
yourself
or
bobby
i
think
i
can
tell
you
how
the
evidence
got
in
your
room
i
can
answer
nearly
everything
there
one
point
he
broke
off
glancing
at
his
watch
extraordinary
courage
he
mused
enigmatically
i
scarcely
understand
it
rawlins
looked
at
him
suspiciously
all
this
explaining
may
be
a
trick
robinson
the
man
slippery
i
had
to
be
slippery
to
work
under
your
noses
paredes
laughed
by
the
way
bobby
did
you
hear
a
woman
crying
about
the
time
i
opened
this
door
yes
it
sounded
like
the
voice
we
heard
at
the
grave
i
thought
i
heard
it
from
the
library
robinson
put
in
then
the
rumpus
up
here
started
and
i
forgot
about
it
the
woman
in
black
is
very
brave
paredes
mused
we
should
have
had
a
visit
from
her
long
before
this
do
you
know
who
she
is
robinson
asked
and
as
rawlins
says
no
tricks
we
have
let
you
go
yet
i
thought
paredes
mocked
that
you
had
identified
the
woman
in
black
as
miss
katherine
she
has
had
anything
to
do
with
the
mystery
directly
neither
has
bobby
neither
have
i
then
what
the
devil
have
you
been
doing
here
robinson
snapped
seeing
your
job
through
paredes
answered
for
bobby
sake
with
a
warm
gratitude
bobby
knew
that
paredes
had
told
the
truth
then
he
had
told
it
in
the
library
yesterday
when
they
had
caught
him
prowling
in
the
private
staircase
all
along
he
had
told
it
while
they
had
tried
to
convict
him
of
and
unfriendly
intentions
i
saw
paredes
was
saying
that
howells
would
succeed
and
it
was
obvious
you
and
rawlins
would
do
worse
while
graham
blundering
from
the
start
left
no
hope
somebody
had
to
rescue
bobby
then
why
did
you
give
us
the
impression
graham
asked
that
you
were
not
a
friend
paredes
held
up
his
hand
that
going
rather
far
graham
never
once
have
i
given
such
an
impression
i
have
time
after
time
stated
the
fact
that
i
was
here
in
bobby
service
that
has
been
the
trouble
with
all
of
you
as
most
detectives
do
you
have
denied
facts
searching
always
for
something
more
subtle
you
have
asked
for
impossibilities
while
you
blustered
that
they
could
exist
still
every
one
is
prone
to
do
that
when
he
fancies
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
supernatural
the
facts
of
this
case
have
been
within
your
reach
as
well
as
mine
the
motive
has
been
an
easy
one
to
understand
money
and
you
have
consistently
turned
your
back
robinson
spread
his
hands
all
right
prove
that
i
a
fool
and
i
acknowledge
it
doctor
groom
interrupted
sharply
what
was
that
they
bent
forward
listening
even
with
paredes
offering
them
a
physical
explanation
they
shrank
from
the
keening
that
barely
survived
the
heavy
atmosphere
of
the
old
house
you
see
the
woman
in
black
is
miss
perrine
paredes
said
he
ran
down
the
stairs
they
followed
responding
to
an
excited
sense
of
imminence
even
in
the
private
staircase
the
pounding
that
had
followed
the
cry
reached
them
with
harsh
reverberations
its
echoes
filled
the
house
as
they
dashed
across
the
library
and
the
dining
room
in
the
hall
they
realized
that
it
came
from
the
front
door
it
had
attained
a
feverish
a
desperate
insistence
paredes
walked
to
the
fireplace
open
the
door
he
directed
rawlins
rawlins
stepped
to
the
door
unlocked
it
and
flung
it
wide
the
woman
katherine
breathed
a
feminine
figure
white
with
snow
stumbled
in
as
if
she
had
stood
braced
against
the
door
rawlins
caught
her
and
held
her
upright
the
flakes
whirled
from
the
court
in
vicious
pursuit
bobby
slammed
the
door
shut
maria
he
cried
you
were
right
hartley
yet
at
first
he
could
scarcely
accept
this
pitiful
creature
as
the
brilliant
and
exotic
dancer
with
whom
he
had
dined
the
night
of
the
first
murder
as
he
stared
at
her
her
features
twisted
she
burst
into
retching
sobs
she
staggered
toward
paredes
as
she
went
the
snow
melted
from
her
hat
and
cloak
she
became
a
black
figure
again
with
an
appearance
of
having
been
immersed
in
water
she
sank
on
the
hearth
swaying
back
and
forth
reaching
blindly
for
paredes
hand
do
what
you
please
with
me
carlos
she
whimpered
with
her
slight
accent
from
which
all
the
music
had
fled
i
could
stand
it
another
minute
i
could
get
to
the
station
and
i
i
wanted
to
know
which
which
paredes
watched
her
curiously
get
jenkins
he
said
softly
to
rawlins
he
faced
maria
again
i
could
have
told
you
i
think
when
you
fought
me
away
out
there
no
one
wants
to
arrest
you
jenkins
will
verify
my
own
knowledge
this
is
dangerous
the
doctor
rumbled
this
woman
should
wait
here
she
should
have
dry
clothing
at
once
maria
shrank
from
him
for
the
first
time
her
wet
skirt
exposed
her
feet
encased
in
torn
stockings
the
dancer
wore
no
shoes
and
bobby
guessed
why
she
had
been
so
elusive
why
she
had
left
so
few
traces
i
wo
go
she
cried
until
he
tells
me
katherine
got
a
cloak
and
threw
it
across
the
woman
shoulders
maria
looked
up
at
her
with
a
dumb
gratitude
then
rawlins
came
back
with
jenkins
the
butler
was
bent
and
haggard
his
surrender
to
fear
was
more
pronounced
than
it
had
been
at
the
grave
or
when
they
had
last
seen
him
in
the
kitchen
he
grasped
a
chair
and
breathing
heavily
looked
from
one
to
the
other
moistening
his
lips
paredes
faced
the
man
completely
master
of
the
situation
through
the
old
butler
it
became
clear
he
would
make
his
revelation
and
announce
that
simple
fact
they
all
had
missed
it
was
silas
of
course
who
came
back
oh
my
god
the
butler
moaned
what
do
you
mean
i
know
everything
jenkins
paredes
said
evenly
the
butler
collapsed
against
the
chair
paredes
grasped
his
arm
pull
yourself
together
man
they
wo
want
you
as
more
than
an
accessory
maria
started
to
rise
she
shrank
back
again
shivering
close
to
the
fire
is
your
master
hiding
paredes
asked
or
has
he
left
the
house
jenkins
answer
came
through
trembling
lips
he
gone
silas
is
gone
how
did
you
find
out
my
god
how
did
you
find
out
he
said
nothing
to
you
paredes
asked
jenkins
shook
his
head
tell
me
how
he
was
dressed
the
old
servant
covered
his
face
silas
stumbled
through
the
kitchen
he
answered
hoarsely
i
tried
to
stop
him
but
he
pushed
me
away
and
ran
out
his
voice
rose
i
tell
you
he
ran
without
a
coat
or
a
hat
into
the
storm
paredes
sighed
the
cedars
final
tragedy
yet
it
was
the
most
graceful
exit
he
could
have
made
maria
struggled
to
her
feet
her
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
person
without
reason
that
familiar
hysterical
quality
which
they
had
heard
before
at
a
distance
vibrated
in
her
voice
then
he
was
the
one
i
wanted
to
kill
him
i
could
kill
him
because
i
never
was
sure
did
you
see
him
go
out
an
hour
or
so
ago
paredes
asked
i
saw
him
she
cried
feverishly
run
from
the
back
of
the
house
and
down
the
path
to
the
lake
i
i
tried
to
catch
him
but
my
feet
were
frozen
and
the
snow
was
slippery
and
i
could
find
my
shoes
but
i
called
and
he
would
stop
i
had
to
know
because
i
wanted
to
kill
him
if
it
was
silas
blackburn
and
i
saw
him
run
to
the
lake
and
splash
in
until
the
water
was
over
his
head
she
flung
her
clenched
hands
out
her
voice
became
a
scream
shot
with
all
her
suffering
all
her
doubt
all
her
fury
you
do
understand
he
ca
be
punished
i
tell
you
he
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
with
the
man
he
murdered
and
i
ca
pay
him
i
tried
to
go
after
him
but
it
it
was
too
cold
she
sank
in
one
of
the
chairs
shaking
and
sobbing
unless
we
want
another
tragedy
the
doctor
said
this
woman
must
be
put
to
bed
and
taken
care
of
she
has
been
terribly
exposed
you
heard
her
she
delirious
not
so
delirious
that
she
has
told
the
truth
paredes
said
the
doctor
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
with
rawlins
help
carried
her
upstairs
katherine
went
with
them
almost
immediately
the
doctor
and
rawlins
hurried
down
i
have
told
katherine
what
to
do
doctor
groom
said
the
woman
may
be
all
right
in
the
morning
what
she
been
up
to
here
then
bobby
cried
there
was
a
connection
between
the
dinner
party
and
the
murders
but
what
about
my
coming
here
unconscious
what
about
my
handkerchief
i
can
see
no
answer
yet
graham
said
paredes
smiled
not
when
you
had
the
answer
to
everything
i
have
shown
you
that
silas
blackburn
was
the
murderer
the
fact
stared
you
in
the
face
everything
that
has
happened
at
the
cedars
has
pointed
to
his
guilt
except
the
doctor
said
his
own
apparent
murder
which
made
his
guilt
seem
impossible
and
i
not
sure
you
right
now
for
there
is
no
other
blackburn
he
could
have
murdered
and
blackburns
look
alike
you
mistake
another
man
for
one
of
them
this
house
paredes
smiled
has
all
along
been
full
of
the
presence
of
the
other
blackburn
there
has
been
evidence
enough
for
you
all
to
have
known
he
was
here
he
stretched
himself
in
an
easy
chair
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
blew
the
smoke
toward
the
ceiling
i
shall
tell
you
the
simple
facts
if
only
to
save
my
skin
from
this
district
attorney
rub
it
in
robinson
grinned
i
take
my
medicine
they
gathered
closer
about
the
panamanian
jenkins
sidled
to
the
back
of
his
chair
i
do
see
how
you
found
it
out
he
muttered
i
had
only
one
advantage
over
you
or
the
police
graham
paredes
began
and
you
were
in
a
position
to
overcome
that
maria
did
telephone
me
the
afternoon
of
that
ghastly
dinner
she
asked
me
to
get
hold
of
bobby
she
was
plainly
anxious
to
keep
him
in
new
york
that
night
and
to
be
frank
i
was
glad
enough
to
help
her
when
you
turned
up
trying
to
impress
us
with
your
puritan
watchfulness
even
you
guessed
that
she
had
drugged
bobby
i
suspected
it
when
i
saw
him
go
to
pieces
in
the
cafe
he
gave
me
the
slip
as
i
told
you
in
the
coat
room
when
i
was
trying
to
get
him
home
so
i
went
back
and
asked
maria
what
her
idea
was
she
laughed
in
my
face
denying
everything
i
too
suspected
the
stranger
but
convinced
myself
that
he
simply
happened
along
by
chance
now
here
the
first
significant
point
maria
by
drugging
bobby
defeated
her
own
purpose
he
had
been
drinking
more
than
the
band
of
hope
would
approve
of
and
on
top
of
that
he
got
an
overdose
of
a
powerful
drug
the
doctor
can
tell
you
better
than
i
of
the
likely
effect
of
such
a
combination
what
i
told
you
in
the
court
bobby
the
doctor
answered
much
the
same
symptoms
as
genuine
aphasia
your
brain
was
unquestionably
dulled
by
an
overdose
on
top
of
all
that
alcohol
while
your
mechanical
reflexes
were
stimulated
automatically
you
followed
your
ruling
impulse
automatically
at
the
last
minute
you
revolted
from
exposing
yourself
in
such
a
condition
to
your
cousin
and
your
grandfather
your
lucid
period
in
the
woods
just
before
you
reached
the
deserted
house
and
went
to
sleep
showed
that
your
exercise
was
overcoming
the
effect
of
the
drug
that
moment
you
remember
was
coloured
by
the
fanciful
ideas
such
a
drug
would
induce
so
bobby
paredes
said
although
you
were
asleep
when
the
body
moved
and
when
howells
was
murdered
you
can
be
sure
you
were
anywhere
near
the
old
room
but
i
walked
in
my
sleep
last
night
bobby
reminded
him
the
doctor
slapped
his
knee
i
understand
it
was
only
when
we
thought
that
was
your
habit
that
it
frightened
us
it
plain
this
had
been
suggested
to
you
and
you
had
brooded
upon
the
suggestion
until
you
were
bound
to
respond
graham
presence
in
your
room
watching
for
just
that
reaction
was
a
perpetual
an
unescapable
stimulation
it
would
have
been
a
miracle
in
itself
if
your
brain
had
failed
to
carry
it
out
bobby
made
a
swift
gesture
of
distaste
if
you
had
come
carlos
where
would
i
have
been
why
did
you
come
graham
asked
bobby
was
my
friend
the
panamanian
answered
he
had
been
very
good
to
me
when
i
read
of
his
grandfather
death
i
wondered
why
maria
had
drugged
him
to
keep
him
in
new
york
in
the
coincidence
lurked
an
element
of
trouble
for
him
at
first
i
suspected
some
kind
of
an
understanding
between
her
and
old
blackburn
perhaps
she
had
engaged
to
keep
bobby
away
from
the
cedars
until
the
new
will
had
been
made
but
here
was
blackburn
murdered
and
it
was
manifest
she
had
tried
to
throw
suspicion
on
bobby
and
the
points
that
made
howells
case
incomplete
assured
me
of
his
innocence
who
then
had
killed
his
grandfather
not
maria
for
i
had
dropped
her
at
her
apartment
that
night
too
late
for
her
to
get
out
here
by
the
hour
of
the
murder
still
as
you
suspected
maria
was
the
key
and
i
began
to
speculate
about
her
she
had
told
me
something
of
her
history
you
might
have
had
as
much
from
her
press
agent
although
she
had
lived
in
spain
since
she
was
a
child
she
was
born
in
panama
my
own
country
of
a
spanish
mother
and
an
american
father
right
away
i
wondered
if
blackburn
had
ever
been
in
panama
or
spain
i
began
to
seek
the
inception
of
the
possible
understanding
between
them
since
i
found
no
illuminating
documents
about
blackburn
past
in
the
library
i
concluded
if
such
papers
existed
they
would
be
locked
up
in
the
desk
in
his
room
i
searched
there
a
number
of
times
giving
you
every
excuse
i
could
think
of
to
get
upstairs
the
other
night
after
i
had
suspected
her
of
knowing
something
miss
katherine
nearly
caught
me
but
i
found
what
i
wanted
a
carefully
hidden
packet
of
accounts
and
letters
and
newspaper
clippings
they
at
your
service
district
attorney
they
told
me
that
silas
blackburn
had
been
in
panama
they
proved
that
maria
instead
of
ever
having
been
his
accomplice
was
his
enemy
they
explained
the
source
of
his
wealth
and
the
foundation
of
that
enmity
certainly
you
remember
the
doctor
told
us
silas
blackburn
started
life
with
nothing
and
you
ever
wondered
why
with
all
his
money
he
buried
himself
in
this
lonely
hole
he
returned
from
south
america
rich
more
than
years
ago
the
doctor
said
why
should
we
bother
about
his
money
i
wish
you
had
bothered
about
several
things
besides
your
ghosts
paredes
said
you
have
found
it
significant
that
blackburn
laid
the
foundation
of
his
fortune
in
panama
during
the
hideous
scandals
of
the
old
french
canal
company
we
knew
he
was
a
selfish
tyrant
that
discovery
showed
me
how
selfish
how
merciless
he
was
for
to
succeed
in
panama
during
those
days
required
an
utter
contempt
for
all
the
standards
of
law
and
decency
the
men
who
got
along
held
life
cheaper
than
a
handful
of
coppers
that
what
i
meant
when
i
walked
around
the
hall
talking
of
the
ghosts
of
panama
for
i
was
beginning
to
see
silas
blackburn
fear
his
trip
to
smithtown
were
the
first
indications
of
the
presence
of
the
other
blackburn
the
papers
outlined
him
more
clearly
why
had
it
been
forgotten
here
doctor
that
silas
blackburn
had
a
brother
his
partner
in
those
wretched
and
profitable
contract
scandals
you
mean
the
doctor
answered
robert
blackburn
he
was
a
year
younger
than
silas
this
boy
was
named
in
memory
of
him
why
should
any
one
have
remembered
he
died
in
south
america
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
before
these
children
were
born
that
what
silas
blackburn
told
you
when
he
came
back
paredes
said
he
may
have
believed
it
at
first
or
he
may
not
have
i
daresay
he
wanted
to
for
he
came
back
with
his
brother
money
as
well
as
his
own
the
cash
and
the
easily
convertible
securities
that
were
all
men
would
handle
in
that
hell
but
he
never
forgot
that
his
brother
wife
was
alive
and
when
he
ran
from
panama
he
knew
she
was
about
to
become
a
mother
that
brings
me
to
the
other
feature
that
made
me
wander
around
here
like
a
restless
spirit
myself
that
night
you
had
just
told
your
story
about
the
woman
crying
if
there
was
a
strange
woman
around
here
it
was
almost
certainly
maria
as
rawlins
deduced
she
must
either
be
hysterical
or
signalling
some
one
why
should
she
come
unless
something
had
gone
wrong
the
night
she
drugged
bobby
to
keep
him
in
new
york
she
was
his
enemy
because
that
very
night
she
did
him
a
good
turn
by
trampling
out
his
tracks
in
the
court
bobby
took
maria
letter
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
paredes
then
how
would
you
account
for
this
the
panamanian
read
the
letter
her
way
of
covering
herself
he
explained
in
case
you
suspected
she
had
made
you
drink
too
much
or
had
drugged
you
she
really
wanted
you
to
come
to
tea
that
afternoon
it
was
after
writing
that
that
she
found
out
what
had
gone
wrong
in
other
words
she
read
in
the
paper
of
silas
blackburn
death
and
in
a
panic
she
put
on
plain
clothes
and
hurried
out
to
see
what
had
happened
the
fact
that
she
forgot
her
managers
her
professional
reputation
everything
testified
to
her
anxiety
and
i
began
to
sense
the
truth
she
had
been
born
in
panama
of
a
spanish
mother
and
an
american
father
she
had
some
stealthy
interest
in
the
cedars
and
the
blackburns
she
was
about
the
right
age
ten
to
one
she
was
silas
blackburn
niece
so
for
me
many
hours
before
silas
blackburn
walked
in
here
the
presence
of
the
other
blackburn
about
the
cedars
became
a
tragic
and
threatening
inevitability
had
silas
blackburn
been
murdered
or
had
his
brother
where
was
the
survivor
who
had
committed
that
brutal
murder
maria
had
come
here
hysterically
to
answer
those
questions
she
might
know
the
light
in
the
deserted
house
she
might
be
hiding
him
and
taking
food
to
him
there
but
her
crying
suggested
a
signal
which
he
never
answered
at
any
rate
i
had
to
find
maria
so
i
slipped
out
i
thought
i
heard
her
at
the
lake
she
was
there
i
was
sure
i
would
trap
her
at
the
deserted
house
for
the
diffused
glow
of
the
light
we
had
seen
proved
that
it
had
come
through
the
cobwebbed
windows
of
the
cellar
which
are
set
in
little
wells
below
the
level
of
the
ground
the
cellar
explained
also
how
she
had
turned
her
flashlight
off
and
slipped
through
the
hall
and
out
while
we
searched
the
rooms
she
had
gone
back
i
could
find
her
so
i
went
on
into
smithtown
and
sent
a
costly
cable
to
my
father
his
answer
came
just
before
silas
blackburn
walked
in
he
had
talked
with
several
of
the
survivors
of
those
evil
days
he
gave
me
a
confirmation
of
everything
i
had
gathered
from
the
papers
the
blackburns
had
quarrelled
over
a
contract
robert
had
been
struck
over
the
head
he
wandered
about
the
isthmus
forgetting
his
name
nursing
one
idea
someone
had
robbed
him
and
he
wanted
his
money
back
or
a
different
kind
of
payment
but
he
could
remember
who
and
he
took
it
out
in
angry
talk
then
he
disappeared
and
people
said
he
had
gone
to
spain
of
course
his
wife
suspected
a
good
deal
in
desk
are
pitiful
and
threatening
letters
from
her
which
he
ignored
then
she
died
and
blackburn
thought
he
was
safe
but
he
took
no
chances
some
survivor
of
those
days
might
turn
up
and
try
blackmail
it
was
safer
to
bury
himself
here
then
bobby
said
maria
must
have
brought
her
father
with
her
when
she
came
from
spain
last
summer
brought
him
or
sent
for
him
paredes
answered
she
made
most
of
her
money
on
this
side
you
know
and
she
as
loyal
and
generous
as
she
is
impulsive
undoubtedly
she
had
the
doctors
do
what
they
could
for
her
father
and
when
she
got
track
of
silas
blackburn
through
you
bobby
she
nursed
in
the
warped
brain
that
dominant
idea
with
her
own
latin
desire
for
justice
and
payment
then
graham
said
that
what
silas
blackburn
was
afraid
of
instead
of
bobby
as
he
tried
to
convince
us
to
cover
himself
one
minute
paredes
robinson
broke
in
why
did
you
maintain
this
extraordinary
secrecy
nobody
would
have
hurt
you
if
you
had
put
us
on
the
right
track
and
asked
for
a
little
help
why
did
you
throw
sand
in
our
eyes
why
did
you
talk
all
the
time
about
ghosts
i
had
to
go
on
tiptoe
paredes
smiled
i
suspected
there
was
at
least
one
spy
in
the
house
so
i
gave
the
doctor
ghost
talk
all
the
impetus
i
could
i
was
like
howells
as
i
told
you
in
believing
the
case
could
be
complete
without
the
discovery
of
the
secret
entrance
of
the
room
of
death
my
belief
in
the
existence
of
such
a
thing
made
me
lean
from
the
first
to
silas
blackburn
rather
than
robert
it
a
tradition
in
many
families
to
hand
such
things
down
to
the
head
of
each
generation
silas
blackburn
was
the
one
most
likely
to
know
such
a
secret
door
had
never
been
mentioned
to
you
had
it
bobby
bobby
shook
his
head
paredes
turned
and
smiled
at
the
haggard
butler
i
right
so
far
am
i
not
jenkins
jenkins
bobbed
his
head
jerkily
then
paredes
went
on
you
might
answer
one
or
two
questions
when
did
the
first
letter
that
frightened
your
master
come
the
day
he
went
to
smithtown
and
talked
to
the
detective
the
butler
quavered
you
can
understand
his
reflections
paredes
mused
money
was
his
god
he
distrusted
and
hated
his
own
flesh
and
blood
because
he
thought
they
coveted
it
he
was
prepared
to
punish
them
by
leaving
it
to
a
public
charity
now
arises
this
apparition
from
the
past
with
no
claim
in
a
court
of
law
with
an
intention
simply
to
ask
and
in
case
of
a
refusal
to
punish
the
conclusion
reached
by
that
selfish
and
merciless
mind
was
inevitable
he
probably
knew
nothing
whatever
about
maria
if
all
the
world
thought
his
brother
dead
his
brother
murder
now
would
alter
anything
i
wager
doctor
that
at
that
time
he
talked
over
wounds
at
the
base
of
the
brain
with
you
the
doctor
moved
restlessly
yes
but
he
was
very
superstitious
we
talked
about
it
in
connection
with
his
ancestors
who
had
died
of
such
wounds
in
that
room
everything
was
ready
when
he
made
the
rendezvous
here
paredes
went
on
he
expected
to
have
bobby
at
hand
in
case
his
plan
failed
and
he
had
to
defend
himself
but
maria
had
made
sure
that
there
should
be
no
help
for
him
when
the
man
came
did
you
take
him
upstairs
jenkins
no
sir
i
watched
that
miss
katherine
did
leave
the
library
but
i
think
she
must
have
caught
silas
in
the
upper
hall
after
he
had
pretended
to
give
up
and
had
persuaded
his
brother
to
spend
the
night
paredes
smiled
whimsically
he
took
two
faded
photographs
from
his
pocket
they
were
of
young
men
after
the
fashion
of
blackburns
remarkably
alike
even
without
the
gray
obliterating
marks
of
old
age
i
found
these
in
the
family
album
he
said
we
should
have
known
the
difference
just
the
same
the
doctor
grumbled
why
did
we
know
the
difference
i
complained
often
enough
paredes
smiled
of
the
necessity
of
using
candles
in
this
house
there
was
never
more
than
one
candle
in
the
old
bedroom
there
were
only
two
when
we
looked
at
the
murdered
man
in
his
coffin
and
in
death
there
are
no
familiar
facial
expressions
no
eccentricities
of
speech
so
you
can
imagine
my
feelings
when
i
tried
to
picture
the
drama
that
had
gone
on
in
that
room
you
can
imagine
poor
maria
which
one
and
maria
did
know
about
the
panel
or
the
use
of
miss
katherine
or
the
handkerchief
all
of
those
details
indicated
silas
blackburn
how
could
my
handkerchief
indicate
anything
of
the
kind
bobby
asked
how
did
it
come
there
what
paredes
said
is
the
commonest
form
of
borrowing
in
the
world
particularly
in
a
climate
where
people
have
frequent
colds
i
found
a
number
of
your
handkerchiefs
in
your
grandfather
bureau
the
handkerchief
furnished
me
with
an
important
clue
it
explains
i
think
jenkins
will
tell
you
the
moving
of
the
body
it
was
obviously
the
cause
of
howells
death
yes
sir
jenkins
quavered
silas
thought
he
had
dropped
his
own
handkerchief
in
the
room
with
the
body
i
do
know
how
you
found
these
things
out
by
adding
two
and
two
paredes
laughed
in
the
first
place
you
must
all
realize
that
we
might
have
had
no
mystery
at
all
if
it
had
been
for
miss
katherine
for
i
do
know
that
maria
could
have
done
much
in
a
legal
way
silas
blackburn
had
intended
to
dispose
of
the
body
immediately
but
miss
katherine
heard
the
panel
move
and
ran
to
the
corridor
she
made
jenkins
break
down
the
door
and
she
sent
for
the
police
silas
blackburn
was
helpless
he
was
beaten
at
that
moment
but
he
did
the
best
he
could
he
went
to
waters
hoping
at
the
worst
to
establish
an
alibi
through
the
who
probably
would
remember
the
exact
hour
of
his
arrival
waters
house
offered
him
too
a
strategic
advantage
you
heard
him
say
the
spare
room
was
on
the
ground
floor
you
heard
him
add
that
he
refused
to
open
his
door
either
asking
to
be
left
alone
or
failing
to
answer
at
all
and
he
had
to
return
to
the
cedars
the
next
day
for
he
missed
his
handkerchief
and
he
pictured
himself
since
he
thought
it
was
his
own
in
the
electric
chair
right
jenkins
yes
sir
i
kept
him
hidden
and
gave
him
his
chance
along
in
the
afternoon
he
wanted
me
to
try
to
find
the
handkerchief
but
i
have
the
courage
he
could
find
it
he
searched
through
the
panel
all
about
the
body
and
the
bed
that
was
when
katherine
heard
bobby
said
when
we
found
the
body
had
been
moved
it
put
him
in
a
dreadful
way
jenkins
mumbled
for
no
one
had
bothered
to
tell
me
it
was
young
robert
the
detective
suspected
and
when
silas
heard
the
detective
boast
that
he
knew
everything
and
would
make
an
arrest
in
the
morning
he
thought
about
the
handkerchief
and
knew
he
was
done
for
unless
he
took
howells
up
and
the
man
did
ask
for
trouble
sir
well
silas
gave
it
to
him
to
save
himself
i
never
been
able
to
understand
paredes
said
why
he
did
take
the
evidence
when
he
killed
howells
did
you
know
you
prevented
that
sir
jenkins
asked
i
heard
you
come
in
from
the
court
i
thought
you
been
listening
i
signalled
silas
there
was
danger
and
to
get
out
of
the
private
stairway
before
you
could
trap
him
and
i
could
give
him
another
chance
for
a
long
time
some
of
you
were
in
the
room
after
that
or
miss
katherine
and
graham
were
sitting
in
the
corridor
watching
the
body
until
just
before
robert
tried
to
get
the
evidence
for
himself
silas
had
to
act
then
it
was
his
last
chance
for
he
thought
robert
would
be
glad
enough
to
turn
him
over
to
the
law
why
did
you
ever
hide
that
stuff
in
miss
katherine
room
bobby
asked
jenkins
flung
up
his
hands
oh
he
was
angry
sir
when
he
knew
the
truth
and
learned
what
a
mistake
he
made
howells
did
give
me
that
report
i
showed
you
it
was
in
his
pocket
with
the
other
things
we
got
it
open
without
tearing
the
envelope
and
silas
read
it
he
would
destroy
anything
he
never
dreamed
of
anybody
suspecting
miss
katherine
so
he
told
me
to
hide
the
things
in
her
bureau
i
think
he
figured
on
using
the
evidence
to
put
the
blame
on
robert
in
case
it
was
the
only
way
to
save
himself
why
did
you
show
the
report
to
me
bobby
asked
i
i
was
afraid
to
take
all
that
responsibility
the
butler
quavered
i
figured
if
you
were
partly
to
blame
it
might
go
easier
with
me
paredes
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
were
a
good
mate
for
silas
blackburn
he
sneered
even
now
i
do
see
how
that
old
scoundrel
had
the
courage
to
show
himself
rawlins
said
that
the
beautiful
justice
of
the
whole
thing
paredes
answered
for
there
was
nothing
else
whatever
for
him
to
do
there
never
had
been
anything
else
for
him
to
do
since
miss
katherine
had
spoiled
his
scheme
since
you
all
believed
that
it
was
he
who
had
been
murdered
he
had
to
hide
the
truth
or
face
the
electric
chair
if
he
disappeared
he
was
infinitely
worse
off
than
though
he
had
settled
with
his
brother
a
man
without
a
home
without
a
name
without
a
penny
jenkins
nodded
he
had
to
come
back
he
said
slowly
and
he
knew
how
scared
you
were
of
the
old
room
the
funeral
and
the
snow
paredes
said
gave
him
his
chance
jenkins
will
doubtless
tell
you
how
they
uncovered
the
grave
late
this
afternoon
took
that
poor
devil
body
and
threw
it
in
the
lake
then
fastened
the
coffin
and
covered
it
again
of
course
the
snow
effaced
every
one
of
their
tracks
he
came
in
naturally
scared
to
death
and
told
us
that
story
based
on
the
legends
of
the
cedars
and
the
doctor
supernatural
theories
and
you
must
admit
that
he
might
as
you
call
it
have
got
away
with
it
he
did
create
a
mystification
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
had
disappeared
there
was
no
murdered
blackburn
as
far
as
you
could
tell
heaven
knows
how
long
you
might
have
struggled
with
the
case
of
howells
he
glanced
up
here
is
miss
katherine
she
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
i
think
she
all
right
she
said
to
the
doctor
she
asleep
she
went
to
sleep
crying
may
i
come
down
the
doctor
nodded
she
walked
down
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
questioningly
poor
maria
paredes
mused
she
the
one
i
pity
most
she
been
at
times
i
think
what
rawlins
suspected
an
insane
woman
wandering
and
crying
through
the
woods
assuredly
she
was
out
of
her
head
when
i
found
her
finally
at
the
grave
i
tried
to
tell
her
that
her
father
was
dead
i
begged
her
to
come
in
i
told
her
we
were
friends
but
she
fought
she
would
answer
my
questions
she
struck
me
finally
when
i
tried
to
force
her
to
come
out
of
the
storm
robinson
i
want
you
to
listen
to
me
for
a
moment
i
honestly
believe
for
everybody
sake
i
did
a
good
thing
when
i
asked
silas
blackburn
just
before
he
disappeared
why
he
had
thrown
his
brother
body
in
the
lake
i
hoped
it
would
simply
make
him
run
for
it
i
prayed
that
we
would
never
hear
from
him
again
and
that
miss
katherine
and
bobby
could
be
spared
the
ugly
scandal
does
this
do
as
well
ca
we
get
along
without
much
publicity
you
about
earned
the
right
to
dictate
robinson
said
gruffly
thanks
for
everybody
sake
bobby
echoed
you
right
carlos
maria
must
be
considered
now
she
shall
have
what
was
taken
from
her
father
with
interest
i
know
katherine
will
agree
katherine
nodded
i
doubt
if
maria
will
want
it
or
take
it
paredes
said
simply
she
has
plenty
of
her
own
it
is
fair
to
think
it
was
greed
that
urged
her
you
must
understand
that
it
was
a
bigger
impulse
than
greed
it
was
a
thing
of
which
we
of
spanish
blood
are
rather
proud
a
desire
for
justice
for
something
that
has
no
softer
name
than
revenge
suddenly
rawlins
stooped
and
took
the
panamanian
hand
say
we
been
giving
you
the
raw
end
of
a
lot
of
snap
judgments
never
got
acquainted
until
glad
to
meet
you
too
robinson
grinned
rawlins
patted
the
panamanian
shoulder
at
that
you
make
a
detective
paredes
yawned
i
disagree
with
you
thoroughly
i
have
no
equipment
beyond
my
eyes
and
my
common
sense
he
yawned
again
he
arranged
the
card
table
in
front
of
the
fire
he
got
the
cards
and
piled
them
in
neat
packs
on
the
green
cloth
he
placed
a
box
of
cigarettes
convenient
to
his
right
hand
he
smoked
i
very
sleepy
but
i
been
so
stupid
over
this
solitaire
since
been
at
the
cedars
that
i
must
solve
it
in
the
interest
of
my
before
i
go
to
bed
bobby
went
to
him
impulsively
i
ashamed
carlos
i
do
know
what
to
say
how
can
i
say
anything
how
can
i
begin
to
thank
you
if
you
ever
tell
me
i
saved
your
life
paredes
yawned
i
shall
have
to
disappear
because
then
you
have
a
claim
on
me
katherine
touched
his
hand
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
it
necessary
for
her
to
speak
paredes
indicated
two
chairs
if
you
are
too
tired
sit
here
and
help
me
for
a
while
perhaps
between
us
we
get
somewhere
i
wonder
why
i
have
been
so
stupid
with
the
thing
after
a
time
as
he
manipulated
the
cards
he
laughed
lightly
the
same
thing
the
thing
i
been
scolding
you
all
for
with
a
perfectly
simple
play
staring
me
in
the
face
i
nearly
made
the
mistake
of
choosing
a
difficult
one
that
would
have
got
me
in
trouble
while
the
simple
one
gives
me
the
game
why
are
people
like
that
as
he
moved
the
cards
with
a
deft
assurance
to
their
desired
combination
he
smiled
drolly
at
graham
rawlins
and
robinson
i
guess
it
must
be
human
nature
do
you
think
so
district
attorney
the
condition
paredes
had
more
than
once
foreseen
was
about
to
shroud
the
cedars
in
loneliness
and
abandonment
after
the
hasty
double
burial
in
the
old
graveyard
the
few
things
bobby
and
katherine
wanted
from
the
house
had
been
packed
and
taken
to
the
station
at
katherine
suggestion
they
had
decided
to
leave
last
of
all
and
to
walk
paredes
with
a
tender
solicitude
had
helped
maria
to
the
waiting
automobile
he
came
back
trying
to
colour
his
with
cheerfulness
after
all
you
may
open
the
place
again
and
let
me
visit
you
you
will
visit
us
perpetually
bobby
said
while
katherine
pressed
the
panamanian
hand
but
never
here
again
we
will
leave
it
to
its
ghosts
as
you
have
often
prophesied
i
am
not
sure
paredes
said
thoughtfully
that
the
ghosts
are
here
it
was
evident
that
graham
wished
to
speak
to
bobby
and
katherine
alone
so
the
panamanian
strolled
back
to
the
automobile
graham
embarrassment
made
them
all
uncomfortable
you
have
not
said
much
to
me
katherine
he
began
is
it
because
i
practically
lied
to
bobby
trying
to
keep
you
apart
she
tried
to
smile
i
too
must
ask
forgiveness
i
should
have
spoken
to
you
as
i
did
the
other
night
in
the
hall
but
i
thought
because
you
saw
bobby
and
i
had
come
together
that
you
had
spied
on
me
had
deliberately
tricked
me
knowing
the
evidence
was
in
my
room
of
course
you
did
try
to
help
bobby
yes
he
said
and
i
tried
to
help
you
that
night
i
was
sure
you
were
innocent
i
believed
the
best
way
to
prove
it
to
them
was
to
let
them
search
the
two
of
you
have
nothing
worse
than
jealousy
to
reproach
me
with
in
a
sense
it
pleased
bobby
that
graham
who
had
always
made
him
feel
unworthy
in
katherine
presence
should
confess
himself
not
beyond
reproach
come
hartley
he
cried
i
was
beginning
to
think
you
were
perfect
we
get
along
all
the
better
the
three
of
us
for
having
had
it
out
graham
murmured
his
thanks
he
joined
paredes
and
maria
in
the
automobile
as
they
drove
off
paredes
turned
his
face
as
he
waved
a
languid
farewell
was
quite
without
expression
bobby
and
katherine
were
left
alone
to
the
thicket
and
the
old
house
after
a
time
they
walked
through
the
court
and
from
the
shadow
of
the
melancholy
walls
at
the
curve
of
the
driveway
they
paused
and
looked
back
the
shroud
of
loneliness
and
abandonment
descending
upon
the
cedars
became
for
them
nearly
ponderable
so
they
turned
from
that
brooding
picture
and
hand
in
hand
walked
out
of
the
forest
into
the
friendly
and
welcoming
sunlight
the
end
