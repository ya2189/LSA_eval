the

had
dipped
behind
the
western
mountains
before
kai

with
twenty

or
more
still
between
him
and
the
city
of
knei

entered
the
forest
which
stretched
almost
to
his
destination
no
person
of
consequence
ever
made
the
journey
unattended
but
kai
lung
professed
to
have
no
fear
remarking
with
extempore
wisdom
when
warned
at
the
previous
village
that
a
worthless
garment
covered
one
with
better
protection
than
that
afforded
by
an
army
of
bowmen
nevertheless
when
within
the
gloomy
aisles
kai
lung
more
than
once
wished
himself
back
at
the
village
or
safely
behind
the
mud
walls
of
knei

and
making
many
vows
concerning
the
amount
of
which
he
would
assuredly
burn
when
he
was
actually
through
the
gates
he
stepped
out
more
quickly
until
suddenly
at
a
turn
in
the
glade
he
stopped
altogether
while
the
watchful
expression
into
which
he
had
unguardedly
dropped
at
once
changed
into
a
mask
of
impassiveness
and
extreme
unconcern
from
behind
the
next
tree
projected
a
long
straight
rod
not
unlike
a
slender
bamboo
at
a
distance
but
to
kai
eye
in
reality
the
barrel
of
a
matchlock
which
would
come
into
line
with
his
breast
if
he
took
another
step
being
a
prudent
man
more
accustomed
to
guile
and
subservience
to
destiny
than
to
force
he
therefore
waited
spreading
out
his
hands
in
proof
of
his
peaceful
acquiescence
and
smiling
cheerfully
until
it
should
please
the
owner
of
the
weapon
to
step
forth

unseen
did
a
moment
later
still
keeping
his
gun
in
an
easy
and
convenient
attitude
revealing
a
stout
body
and
a
scarred
face
which
in
conjunction
made
it
plain
to
kai

that

was
in
the
power
of

a
noted
brigand
of
whom
he
had
heard
much
in
the
villages
illustrious
person
said
kai

very
earnestly
is
evidently
an
unfortunate
mistake
doubtless
you
were
expecting
some
exalted
mandarin
to
come
and
render
you
homage
and
were
preparing
to
overwhelm
him
with
gratified
confusion
by
escorting
him
yourself
to
your
abode
indeed
i
passed
such
a
one
on
the
road
very
richly
apparelled
who
inquired
of

should
first
attend
to
one
whose
manners

betray
him
to
be

extreme
affability

therefore
to
my
mean
and
uninviting

more
honour
than

can
reasonably
bear
by
following
closely
in

footsteps
and
guarding
your

with
this
inadequate
but
seeing
no
chance
of
immediate
escape
kai
lung
led
the
way
instructed
by
the
brigand
along
a
very
difficult
and
bewildering
path
until
they
reached
a
cave
hidden
among
the
crags
here
lin
yi
called
out
some
words
in
the
miaotze
tongue
whereupon
a
follower
appeared
and
opened
a
gate
in
the
stockade
of
prickly
mimosa
which
guarded
the
mouth
of
the
den
within
the
enclosure
a
fire
burned
and
food
was
being
prepared
at
a
word
from
the
chief
the
unfortunate
kai
lung
found
his
hands
seized
and
tied
behind
his
back
while
a
second
later
a
rough
hemp
rope
was
fixed
round
his
neck
and
the
other
end
tied
to
an
overhanging
tree
lin
yi
smiled
pleasantly
and
critically
upon
these
preparations
and
when
they
were
complete
dismissed
his
follower
we
can
converse
at
our
ease
and
without
restraint
he
remarked
to

be
a
distinguished
privilege
for
a
person
occupying
the
important
public
position
which
you
undoubtedly
do
for

my

are
so
degraded
and
that
nothing
gives
me
more
gratification
than
to
dispense
with

this
kai
lung
made
no
reply
chiefly
because
at
that
moment
the
wind
swayed
the
tree
and
compelled
him
to
stand
on
his
toes
in
order
to
escape
suffocation
would
be
useless
to
try
to
conceal
from
a
person
of
your
inspired
intelligence
that
i
am
indeed
lin

continued
the

is
a
dignified
position
to
occupy
and
one
for
which
i
am
quite
incompetent
in
the
sixth
month
of
the
third
year
ago
it
chanced
that
this
unworthy
person
at
that
time
engaged
in
commercial
affairs
at
knei
yang
became
inextricably
immersed
in
the
insidious
delights
of
having
been
entrusted
with
a
large
number
of
taels
with
which
to
purchase
teeth
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
doubled
the
number
of
taels
by
staking
them
upon
an
exceedingly
powerful
and
agile
quail
he
would
be
able
to
purchase
twice
the
number
of
teeth
and
so
benefit
his
patron
to
a
large
extent
this
matter
was
clearly
forced
upon
his
notice
by
a
dream
in
which
he
perceived
one
whom
he
then
understood
to
be
the
benevolent
spirit
of
an
ancestor
in
the
act
of
stroking
a
particular
quail
upon
whose
chances
he
accordingly
placed
all
he
possessed
doubtless
evil
spirits
had
been
employed
in
the
matter
for
to
this
great
astonishment
the
quail
in
question
failed
in
a
very
discreditable
manner
at
the
encounter
unfortunately
this
person
had
risked
not
only
the
money
which
had
been
entrusted
to
him
but
all
that
he
had
himself
become
possessed
of
by
some
years
of
honourable
toil
and
assiduous
courtesy
as
a
professional
witness
in
law
cases
not
doubting
that
his
patron
would
see
that
he
was
himself
greatly
to
blame
in
confiding
so
large
a
sum
of
money
to
a
comparatively
young
man
of
whom
he
knew
little
this
person
placed
the
matter
before
him
at
the
same
time
showing
him
that
he
would
suffer
in
the
eyes
of
the
virtuous
if
he
did
not
restore
this
savings
which
but
for
the
presence
of
the
larger
sum
and
a
generous
desire
to
benefit
his
patron
he
would
never
have
risked
in
so
uncertain
a
venture
as
that
of
although
the
facts
were
laid
in
the
form
of
a
dignified
request
instead
of
a
demand
by
legal
means
and
the
reasoning
carefully
drawn
up
in
columns
of
fine
parchment
by
a
very
illustrious
writer
the
reply
which
this
person
received
showed
him
plainly
that
a
wrong
view
had
been
taken
of
the
matter
and
that
the
time
had
arrived
when
it
became
necessary
for
him
to
make
a
suitable
rejoinder
by
leaving
the
city
without
was
a
and
disinterested
course
to
take

great
conviction

replied
lin

passing
through
this
forest
in
the
season
of
many
white
vapours
the
spirits
of
his
bad
deeds
appeared
to
him
in
misleading
and
symmetrical
shapes
and
drew
him
out
of
the
path
and
away
from
his
bowmen
after
suffering
many
torments
he
found
his
way
here
where
in
spite
of
our
continual
care
he
perished
miserably
and
in
great
bodily
pain
but
i
can
not
conceal
from
myself
in
spite
of
your
distinguished
politeness
that
i
am
becoming
intolerably
tiresome
with
my
commonplace
the
contrary
replied
kai

listening
to
your
voice
i
seemed
to
hear
the
beating
of
many
gongs
of
the
finest
and
most
polished
brass
i
floated
in
the
middle
air
and
for
the
time
i
even
became
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
this
honourable
appendage
though
fashioned
as
i
perceive
out
of
the
most
delicate

it
exceedingly
difficult
for
me

not

exclaimed
lin

with
some
indignation
as
with
his
own
hands
he
slackened
the
rope
and
taking
it
from
kai
neck
fastened
it
around
his
ankle
in
return
for
my
uninviting
confidences

not
my
senses
be
gladdened
by
a
recital
of
the
titles
and
honours
borne
by
your

at
this
moment
many

of
the
highest

anxiously
awaiting

of

no

mostly
of
the
criminal
class
his
wealth
is
not
more
than
some
six

eight

in
his

his
entire
consists
of
a
few
unendurable
and
badly

stories
to

however
it
is
his
presumptuous

shortly
to
add
a
dignified
narrative
of

the

he

surrounded

it
is
concerned
with
the
adventures
of
one

who
bore
the
honourable
name
of

the

and
indeed
the
greater
part
of
the
narrative
as
related
by
the
venerable
and
accomplished
writer
of
history
is
taken
up
by
showing
how
ling
was
assuredly
descended
from
an
enlightened
emperor
of
the
race
of
tsin
but
as
the
no
less
omniscient
proves
beyond
doubt
that
the
person
in
question
was
in
no
way
connected
with
any
but
a
line
of
hereditary
who
entered
china
from
an
unknown
country
many
centuries
ago
it
would
ill
become
this
illiterate
person
to
express
an
opinion
on
either
side
and
he
will
in
consequence
omit
the
first
seventeen
books
of
the
story
and
only
deal
with
the
three
which
refer
to
the
illustrious
ling
the
story
of
ling
narrated
by
kai
lung
when
a
prisoner
in
the
camp
of
lin
yi
ling
was
the
youngest
of
three
sons
and
from
his
youth
upwards
proved
to
be
of
a
mild
and
studious
disposition
most
of
his
time
was
spent
in
reading
the
sacred
books
and
at
an
early
age
he
found
the
worship
of
apes
to
be
repulsive
to
his
gentle
nature
and
resolved
to
break
through
the
venerable
traditions
of
his
family
by
devoting
his
time
to
literary
pursuits
and
presenting
himself
for
the
public
examinations
at
canton
in
this
his
resolution
was
strengthened
by
a
rumour
that
an
army
of
bowmen
was
shortly
to
be
raised
from
the
province
in
which
he
lived
so
that
if
he
remained
he
would
inevitably
be
forced
into
an
occupation
which
was
even
more
distasteful
to
him
than
the
one
he
was
leaving
having
arrived
at
canton
first
care
was
to
obtain
particulars
of
the
examinations
which
he
clearly
perceived
from
the
unusual
activity
displayed
on
all
sides
to
be
near
at
hand
on
inquiring
from
he
received
very
conflicting
information
for
the
persons
to
whom
he
spoke
were
themselves
entered
for
the
competition
and
therefore
naturally
misled
him
in
order
to
increase
their
own
chances
of
success
perceiving
this
ling
determined
to
apply
at
once
although
the
light
was
past
to
a
mandarin
who
was
concerned
in
the
examinations
lest
by
delay
he
should
lose
his
chance
for
the
year
is
an
unfortunate
event
that
so
distinguished
a
person
should
have
selected
this
day
and
hour
on
which
to
overwhelm
us
with
his
affable
politeness
exclaimed
the
porter
at
the
gate
of
the
yamen
when

had
explained
his
reason
for
going
such
a
day
in

reign
of
the
virtuous
emperor

a
very
benevolent
and
unassuming

of

destroyed
by
treachery
and
ever

be
punished
with

remarked
after
he
had
examined
his
mind
for
a
short
time
may
meet
with
an
ungraceful
and
objectionable
death
if
i
carry
out
your
estimable
instructions
but
i
shall
certainly
merit
and
receive
a
similar
fate
if
i
permit
so
renowned
and
versatile
a
person
to
leave
without
a
fitting
reception
in
such
matters
a
person
can
only
trust
to
the
intervention
of
good
spirits
if
therefore
you
will
permit
this
unworthy
individual
to
wear
while
making
the
venture
the
ring
which
he
perceives
upon
your
finger
and
which
he
recognizes
as
a
very
powerful
charm
against
evil
misunderstandings
and
extortion
he
will
go
without
overjoyed
at
the
amiable
efforts
on
his
behalf
ling
did
as
he
was
desired
and
the
other
retired
presently
the
door
of
the
yamen
was
opened
by
an
attendant
of
the
house
and
ling
bidden
to
enter
he
was
covered
with
astonishment
to
find
that
this
person
was
entirely
unacquainted
with
his
name
or
purpose
said
the
attendant
when
ling
had
explained
his
object
said
the
renowned
and
inspired
ting
fo
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
it
is
unnecessary
to
consult
the
book
of
dates
as
to
the
precise
meaning
of
the
at
this
moment
my
master
is
engaged
in
conversation
with
all
the
most
honourable
and
refined
persons
in
canton
while
singers
and
dancers
of
a
very
expert
and
nimble
order
have
been
sent
for
the
entertainment
will
undoubtedly
last
far
into
the
night
and
to
present
myself
even
with
the
excuse
of
your
graceful
and
delicate
inquiry
would
certainly
result
in
very
objectionable
consequences
to
this
is
indeed
a
day
of
unprepossessing
circumstances
replied
ling
and
after
many
honourable
remarks
concerning
his
own
intellect
and
appearance
and
those
of
the
person
to
whom
he
was
speaking
he
had
turned
to
leave
when
the
other
continued
since
your
dignified
presence
illumined
this
very
ordinary
chamber
this
person
has
been
endeavouring
to
bring
to
his
mind
an
incident
which
occurred
to
him
last
night
while
he
slept
now
it
has
come
back
to
him
with
a
diamond
clearness
and
he
is
satisfied
that
it
was
as
follows
while
he
floated
in
the
middle
air
a
benevolent
spirit
in
the
form
of
an
elderly
and
toothless
vampire
appeared
leading
by
the
hand
a
young
man
of
elegant
personality
smiling
encouragingly
upon
this
person
the
spirit
said
fou
recipient
of
many
favours
from
mandarins
and
of
innumerable
taels
from
gratified
persons
whom
you
have
obliged
i
am
even
at
this
moment
guiding
this
exceptional
young
man
towards
your
presence
when
he
arrives
do
not
hesitate
but
do
as
he
desires
no
matter
how
great
the
danger
seems
or
how
inadequately
you
may
appear
to
be
rewarded
on
the
vision
then
melted
but
i
now
clearly
perceive
that
with
the
exception
of
the
embroidered
cloak
which
you
wear
you
are
the
person
thus
indicated
to
me
remove
your
cloak
therefore
in
order
to
give
the
amiable
spirit
no
opportunity
of
denying
the
fact
and
i
will
advance
your
wishes
for
as
the
book
of
verses
indicates
person
who
patiently
awaits
a
sign
from
the
clouds
for
many
years
and
yet
fails
to
notice
the
earthquake
at
his
feet
is
devoid
of
convinced
that
he
was
assuredly
under
the
especial
protection
of
the
deities
and
that
the
end
of
his
search
was
in
view
ling
gave
his
rich
cloak
to
the
attendant
and
was
immediately
shown
into
another
room
where
he
was
left
alone
after
a
considerable
space
of
time
the
door
opened
and
there
entered
a
person
whom
ling
at
first
supposed
to
be
the
mandarin
indeed
he
was
addressing
him
by
his
titles
when
the
other
interrupted
him
not
distress
your
incomparable
mind
by
searching
for
honourable
names
to
apply
to
so
inferior
a
person
as
myself
he
said
agreeably
mistake
is
nevertheless
very
natural
for
however
miraculous
it
may
appear
this
unseemly
individual
who
is
in
reality
merely
a
writer
of
spoken
words
is
admitted
to
be
exceedingly
like
the
dignified
mandarin
himself
though
somewhat
stouter
clad
in
better
garments
and
it
is
said
less
obtuse
of
intellect
this
last
matter
he
very
much
doubts
for
he
now
finds
himself
unable
to
recognize
by
name
one
who
is
undoubtedly
entitled
to
wear
the
royal
with
this
encouragement
ling
once
more
explained
his
position
narrating
the
events
which
had
enabled
him
to
reach
the
second
chamber
of
the
yamen
when
he
had
finished
the
secretary
was
overpowered
with
a
indignation
those
depraved
and
rapacious
persons
who
have
both
misled
and
robbed
you
shall
suffer
when
the
whole
matter
is
brought
to
light
he
exclaimed
noble
mandarin
neither
fasts
nor
receives
guests
for
indeed
he
has
slept
since
the
sun
went
down
this
person
would
unhesitatingly
break
his
slumber
for
so
commendable
a
purpose
were
it
not
for
a
circumstance
of
intolerable
unavoidableness
it
must
not
even
be
told
in
a
low
breath
beyond
the
walls
of
the
yamen
but
my
benevolent
and
lord
is
in
reality
a
person
of
very
miserly
instinct
and
nothing
will
call
him
from
his
natural
sleep
but
the
sound
of
taels
shaken
beside
his
bed
in
an
unexpected
manner
it
comes
about
that
this
person
is
quite
unsupplied
with
anything
but
thin
printed
papers
of
a
thousand
taels
each
and
these
are
quite
useless
for
the
is
unendurable
that
so
obliging
a
person
should
be
put
to
such
inconvenience
on
behalf
of
one
who
will
certainly
become
a
public
at
the
examinations
said
ling
with
deep
feeling
and
taking
from
a
concealed
spot
in
his
garments
a
few
taels
he
placed
them
before
the
secretary
for
the
use
he
had
indicated
ling
was
again
left
alone
for
upwards
of
two
strokes
of
the
gong
and
was
on
the
point
of
sleep
when
the
secretary
returned
with
an
expression
of
dignified
satisfaction
upon
his
countenance
concluding
that
he
had
been
successful
in
the
manner
of
awakening
the
mandarin
ling
was
opening
his
mouth
for
a
polite
speech
which
should
contain
a
delicate
allusion
to
the
taels
when
the
secretary
warned
him
by
affecting
a
sudden
look
of
terror
that
silence
was
exceedingly
desirable
and
at
the
same
time
opened
another
door
and
indicated
to
ling
that
he
should
pass
through
in
the
next
room
ling
was
overjoyed
to
find
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
mandarin
who
received
him
graciously
and
paid
many
estimable
compliments
to
the
name
he
bore
and
the
country
from
which
he
came
when
at
length
ling
tore
himself
from
this
enchanting
conversation
and
explained
the
reason
of
his
presence
the
mandarin
at
once
became
a
prey
to
the
whitest
and
most
melancholy
emotions
even
plucking
two
hairs
from
his
pigtail
to
prove
the
extent
and
conscientiousness
of
his
grief
he
cried
at
length
am
resolved
that
the
extortionate
and
persons
at
peking
who
have
control
of
the
examination
rites
and
customs
shall
no
longer
grow
without
remark
this
person
will
unhesitatingly
proclaim
the
true
facts
of
the
case
without
regarding
the
danger
that
the
versatile
chancellor
or
even
the
sublime
emperor
himself
may
while
he
speaks
be
concealed
in
some
part
of
this
unassuming
room
to
hear
his
words
for
as
it
is
wisely
said
marked
out
by
destiny
a
person
will
assuredly
be
drowned
even
though
he
passes
the
whole
of
his
existence
among
the
highest
branches
of
a
date
am
overwhelmed
that
i
should
be
the
cause
of
such
an
engaging
display
of
polished
agitation
said
ling
as
the
mandarin
paused
it
would
make
your
own
stomach
less
heavy
this
person
will
willingly
follow
your
estimable
example
either
with
or
without
knowing
the
matter
is
altogether
on
your
account
o
most
unobtrusive
young
man
replied
the
mandarin
when
a
voice
without
passion
was
restored
to
him
tears
me
internally
with
hooks
to
reflect
that
you
whose
refined
ancestors
i
might
reasonably
have
known
had
i
passed
my
youth
in
another
province
should
be
victim
to
the
cupidity
of
the
ones
in
authority
at
peking
a
very
short
time
before
you
arrived
there
came
a
messenger
in
haste
from
those
persons
clearly
indicating
that
a
legal
toll
of
sixteen
taels
was
to
be
made
on
each
printed
paper
setting
forth
the
time
and
manner
of
the
examinations
although
as
you
may
see
the
paper
is
undoubtedly
marked
are
given
notice
that
they
are
defrauded
of
any
sum
which
they
may
be
induced
to
exchange
for
this
furthermore
there
is
a
legal
toll
of
nine
taels
on
all
persons
who
have
previously
been
examined
am
happily
escaped
from
that
exclaimed
ling
with
some
satisfaction
as
the
mandarin
paused
and
twelve
taels
on
all
who
present
themselves
for
the
first
time
this
is
to
be
delivered
over
when
the
paper
is
purchased
so
that
you
by
reason
of
this
unworthy
proceeding
at
peking
are
required
to
forward
to
that
place
through
this
person
no
less
than
is
a
circumstance
of
considerable
regret
replied
ling
had
i
only
reached
canton
a
day
earlier
i
should
it
appears
have
avoided
this
it
would
have
been
so
replied
the
mandarin
who
had
become
engrossed
in
exalted
meditation
he
continued
a
moment
later
as
he
bowed
to
ling
with
an
accomplished
smile
would
certainly
be
a
more
pleasant
thought
for
a
person
of
your
refined
intelligence
that
had
you
delayed
until
the
insatiable
persons
at
peking
might
be
demanding
twice
the
pondering
the
deep
wisdom
of
this
remark
ling
took
his
departure
but
in
spite
of
the
most
assiduous
watchfulness
he
was
unable
to
discern
any
of
the
three
obliging
persons
to
whose
efforts
his
success
had
been
due
chapter
iii
it
was
very
late
when
ling
again
reached
the
small
room
which
he
had
selected
as
soon
as
he
reached
canton
but
without
waiting
for
food
or
sleep
he
made
himself
fully
acquainted
with
the
times
of
the
forthcoming
examinations
and
the
details
of
the
circumstances
connected
with
them
with
much
satisfaction
he
found
that
he
had
still
a
week
in
which
to
revive
his
intellect
on
the
most
difficult
subjects
having
become
relieved
on
these
points
ling
retired
for
a
few
sleep
but
rose
again
very
early
and
gave
the
whole
day
with
great
steadfastness
to
contemplation
of
the
sacred
classics
with
the
exception
of
a
short
period
spent
in
purchasing
ink
brushes
and
the
following
day
having
become
mentally
depressed
through
witnessing
unaccountable
hordes
of
candidates
thronging
the
streets
of
canton
ling
put
aside
his
books
and
passed
the
time
in
visiting
all
the
most
celebrated
tombs
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
lightened
in
mind
by
this
charitable
and
agreeable
occupation
he
returned
to
his
studies
with
a
fixed
resolution
nor
did
he
again
falter
in
his
purpose
on
the
evening
of
the
examination
when
he
was
sitting
alone
reading
by
the
aid
of
a
single
light
as
his
custom
was
a
person
arrived
to
see
him
at
the
same
time
manifesting
a
considerable
appearance
of
secrecy
and
reserve
inwardly
sighing
at
the
interruption
ling
nevertheless
received
him
with
distinguished
consideration
and
respect
setting
tea
before
him
and
performing
towards
it
many
honourable
actions
with
his
own
hands
not
until
some
hours
had
sped
in
conversation
relating
to
the
health
of
the
emperor
the
unexpected
appearance
of
a
fiery
dragon
outside
the
city
and
the
insupportable
price
of
opium
did
the
visitor
allude
to
the
object
of
his
presence
has
been
observed
he
remarked
the
accomplished
ling
who
aspires
to
a
satisfactory
rank
at
the
examinations
has
never
before
made
the
attempt
doubtless
in
this
case
a
preternatural
wisdom
will
avail
much
and
its
fortunate
possessor
will
not
go
unrewarded
yet
it
is
as
precious
stones
among
ashes
for
one
to
triumph
in
such
fact
is
known
to
this
person
replied
ling
sadly
the
thought
of
the
years
he
may
have
to
wait
before
he
shall
have
passed
even
the
first
degree
weighs
down
his
soul
with
bitterness
from
time
to
is
no
infrequent
thing
for
men
of
accomplished
perseverance
but
merely
ordinary
intellects

grow

examination

afflicted
with
various
malignant
evils
while
not
a
few
chiefly
those
who
are
presenting
themselves
for
the
first
time
are
so
overcome
on
perceiving
the
examination
paper
and
understanding
the
inadequate
nature
of
their
own
accomplishments
that
they
become
an
easy
prey
to
the
malicious
spirits
which
are
ever
on
the
watch
in
those
places
and
after
covering
their
leaves
with
unpresentable
remarks
and
drawings
of
men
and
women
of
distinguished
rank
have
at
length
to
be
forcibly
carried
away
by
the
attendants
and
secured
with
heavy
things

by
a
due
regard
paid
to
spirits

good
and
bad

proper
esteem

a
sufficiency
of
charms

of

and
yet
to

undoubtedly
possible

according
to
the
immortal
principles
admitted
the
stranger
it
is
not
an
undertaking
in
which
a
refined
person
would
take
intelligent
pleasure
as
the
proverb
says
is
a
wise
and
enlightened
suppliant
who
seeks
to
discover
an
honourable
mandarin
but
he
is
a
fool
who
cries
out
have
found
however
it
is
obvious
that
the
reason
of
my
visit
is
understood
and
that
your
distinguished
confidence
in
yourself
is
merely
a
graceful
endeavour
to
obtain
my
services
for
a
less
amount
of
taels
than
i
should
otherwise
have
demanded
for
half
the
usual
sum
therefore
this
person
will
take
your
place
in
the
examination
cell
and
enable
your
versatile
name
to
appear
in
the
winning
lists
while
you
pass
your
moments
in
irreproachable
pleasures
such
a
course
had
never
presented
itself
to
ling
as
the
person
who
narrates
this
story
has
already
marked
he
had
passed
his
life
beyond
the
influence
of
the
ways
and
manners
of
towns
and
at
the
same
time
he
had
naturally
been
endowed
with
an
unobtrusive
highmindedness
it
appeared
to
him
in
consequence
that
by
accepting
this
engaging
offer
he
would
be
placing
those
who
were
competing
with
him
at
a
disadvantage
this
person
clearly
sees
that
it
is
a
difficult
matter
for
him
to
explain
how
this
could
be
as
ling
would
undoubtedly
reward
the
services
of
the
one
who
took
his
place
nor
would
the
number
of
the
competitors
be
in
any
way
increased
yet
in
such
a
way
the
thing
took
shape
before
his
eyes
knowing
however
that
few
persons
would
be
able
to
understand
this
action
and
being
desirous
of
not
injuring
the
estimable
emotions
of
the
obliging
person
who
had
come
to
him
ling
made
a
number
of
polished
excuses
in
declining
hiding
the
true
reason
within
himself
in
this
way
he
earned
the
powerful
malignity
of
the
person
in
question
who
would
not
depart
until
he
had
effected
a
number
of
very
disagreeable
prophecies
connected
with
unpropitious
omens
and
internal
torments
all
of
which
undoubtedly
had
a
great
influence
on
life
beyond
that
time
each
day
of
the
examination
found
ling
alternately
elated
or
depressed
according
to
the
length
and
style
of
the
essay
which
he
had
written
while
enclosed
in
his
solitary
examination
cell
the
trials
each
lasted
a
complete
day
and
long
before
the
fifteen
days
which
composed
the
full
examination
were
passed
ling
found
himself
half
regretting
that
he
had
not
accepted
his
offer
or
even
reviling
the
day
on
which
he
had
abandoned
the
hereditary
calling
of
his
ancestors
however
when
after
all
was
over
he
came
to
deliberate
with
himself
on
his
chances
of
attaining
a
degree
he
could
not
disguise
from
his
own
mind
that
he
had
hopes
he
was
not
conscious
of
any
undignified
errors
and
in
reply
to
several
questions
he
had
been
able
to
introduce
curious
knowledge
which
he
possessed
by
means
of
his
exceptional
circumstances
knowledge
which
it
was
unlikely
that
any
other
candidate
would
have
been
able
to
make
himself
master
of
at
length
the
day
arrived
on
which
the
results
were
to
be
made
public
and
ling
together
with
all
the
other
competitors
and
many
distinguished
persons
attended
at
the
great
hall
of
intellectual
coloured
lights
to
hear
the
reading
of
the
lists
eight
thousand
candidates
had
been
examined
and
from
this
number
less
than
two
hundred
were
to
be
selected
for
appointments
amid
a
most
distinguished
silence
the
winning
names
were
read
out
waves
of
most
undignified
but
inevitable
emotion
passed
over
those
assembled
as
the
list
neared
its
end
and
the
chances
of
success
became
less
at
each
spoken
word
and
then
finding
that
his
was
not
among
them
together
with
the
greater
part
of
those
present
he
became
a
prey
to
very
inelegant
thoughts
which
were
not
lessened
by
the
refined
cries
of
triumph
of
the
successful
persons
among
this
confusion
the
one
who
had
read
the
lists
was
observed
to
be
endeavouring
to
make
his
voice
known
whereupon
in
the
expectation
that
he
had
omitted
a
name
the
tumult
was
quickly
subdued
by
those
who
again
had
pleasurable
visions
was
among
the
candidates
one
of
the
name
of
ling
said
he
when
had
been
obtained
written
leaves
produced
by
this
person
are
of
a
most
versatile
and
conflicting
order
so
that
indeed
the
accomplished
examiners
themselves
are
unable
to
decide
whether
they
are
very
good
or
very
bad
in
this
matter
therefore
it
is
clearly
impossible
to
place
the
expert
and
inimitable
ling
among
the
foremost
as
his
very
uncertain
success
may
have
been
brought
about
with
the
assistance
of
evil
spirits
nor
would
it
be
safe
to
pass
over
his
efforts
without
reward
as
he
may
be
under
the
protection
of
powerful
but
exceedingly
deities
the
estimable
ling
is
told
to
appear
again
at
this
place
after
the
gong
has
been
struck
three
times
when
the
matter
will
have
been
looked
at
from
all
at
this
announcement
there
arose
another
great
tumult
several
crying
out
that
assuredly
their
written
leaves
were
either
very
good
or
very
bad
but
no
further
proclamation
was
made
and
very
soon
the
hall
was
cleared
by
force
at
the
time
stated
ling
again
presented
himself
at
the
hall
and
was
honourably
received
unusual
circumstances
of
the
matter
have
already
been
put
forth
said
an
elderly
mandarin
of
engaging
appearance
that
nothing
remains
to
be
made
known
except
the
end
of
our
despicable
efforts
to
come
to
an
agreeable
conclusion
in
this
we
have
been
made
successful
and
now
desire
to
notify
the
result
a
very
desirable
and
not
unremunerative
office
rarely
bestowed
in
this
manner
is
lately
vacant
and
taking
into
our
minds
the
circumstances
of
the
event
and
the
fact
that
ling
comes
from
a
province
very
esteemed
for
the
warlike
instincts
of
its
inhabitants
we
have
decided
to
appoint
him
commander
of
the
valiant
and
band
of
archers
now
stationed
at
in
the
province
of
we
have
spoken
let
three
guns
go
off
in
honour
of
the
noble
and
invincible
ling
now
and
henceforth
a
commander
in
the
army
of
the
sublime
emperor
brother
of
the
sun
and
moon
and
upholder
of
the
four
corners
of
the
chapter
iv
many
hours
passed
before
ling
now
more
downcast
in
mind
than
the
most
unsuccessful
student
in
canton
returned
to
his
room
and
sought
his
couch
of
dried
rushes
all
his
efforts
to
have
his
distinguished
appointment
set
aside
had
been
without
avail
and
he
had
been
ordered
to
reach
within
a
week
as
he
passed
through
the
streets
elegant
processions
in
honour
of
the
winners
met
him
at
every
corner
and
drove
him
into
the
outskirts
for
the
object
of
quietness
there
he
remained
until
the
beating
of
paper
drums
and
the
sound
of
exulting
voices
could
be
heard
no
more
but
even
when
he
returned
lanterns
shone
in
many
dwellings
for
two
hundred
persons
were
composing
verses
setting
forth
their
renown
and
undoubted
accomplishments
ready
to
affix
to
their
doors
and
send
to
friends
on
the
next
day
not
giving
any
portion
of
his
mind
to
this
desirable
act
of
behaviour
ling
flung
himself
upon
the
floor
and
finding
sleep
unattainable
plunged
himself
into
profound
meditation
of
a
very
uninviting
order
doubt
he
exclaimed
can
only
arise
from
evil
and
as
this
person
has
always
endeavoured
to
lead
a
life
in
which
his
devotions
have
been
equally
divided
between
the
sacred
emperor
his
illustrious
parents
and
his
venerable
ancestors
the
fault
can
not
lie
with
him
of
the
excellence
of
his
parents
he
has
full
knowledge
regarding
the
emperor
it
might
not
be
safe
to
conjecture
it
is
therefore
probable
that
some
of
his
ancestors
were
persons
of
abandoned
manner
and
inelegant
habits
to
worship
whom
results
in
evil
rather
than
good
otherwise
how
could
it
be
that
one
whose
chief
delight
lies
in
the
passive
contemplation
of
the
four
books
and
the
five
classics
should
be
selected
by
destiny
to
fill
a
position
calling
for
great
personal
courage
and
an
aggressive
nature
assuredly
it
can
only
end
in
a
mean
and
insignificant
death
perhaps
not
even
followed
by
in
this
manner
of
thought
he
fell
asleep
and
after
certain
very
base
and
impressive
dreams
from
which
good
omens
were
altogether
absent
he
awoke
and
rose
to
begin
his
preparations
for
leaving
the
city
after
two
days
spent
chiefly
in
obtaining
certain
safeguards
against
treachery
and
the
bullets
of
foemen
purchasing
opium
and
other
gifts
with
which
to
propitiate
the
soldiers
under
his
charge
and
in
consulting
witches
and
readers
of
the
future
he
set
out
and
by
travelling
in
extreme
discomfort
reached
within
five
days
during
his
journey
he
learned
that
the
entire
province
was
engaged
in
secret
rebellion
several
towns
indeed
having
declared
against
the
imperial
army
without
reserve
those
persons
to
whom
ling
spoke
described
the
rebels
with
respectful
admiration
as
fierce
and
unnaturally
skilful
in
all
methods
of
fighting
revengeful
and
merciless
towards
their
enemies
very
numerous
and
above
the
ordinary
height
of
human
beings
and
endowed
with
qualities
which
made
their
skin
capable
of
turning
aside
every
kind
of
weapon
furthermore
he
was
assured
that
a
large
band
of
the
most
abandoned
and
best
trained
was
at
that
moment
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
ling
was
not
destined
long
to
remain
in
any
doubt
concerning
the
truth
of
these
matters
for
as
he
made
his
way
through
a
dark
cypress
wood
a
few
li
from
the
houses
of
the
sounds
of
a
confused
outcry
reached
his
ears
and
on
stepping
aside
to
a
hidden
glade
some
distance
from
the
path
he
beheld
a
young
and
elegant
maiden
of
incomparable
beauty
being
carried
away
by
two
persons
of
most
repulsive
and
undignified
appearance
whose
dress
and
manner
clearly
betrayed
them
to
be
rebels
of
the
lowest
and
type
at
this
sight
ling
became
possessed
of
feelings
of
a
savage
yet
agreeable
order
which
until
that
time
he
had
not
conjectured
to
have
any
place
within
his
mind
and
without
even
pausing
to
consider
whether
the
planets
were
in
favourable
positions
for
the
enterprise
to
be
undertaken
at
that
time
he
drew
his
sword
and
ran
forward
with
loud
cries
unsettled
in
their
intentions
at
this
unexpected
action
the
two
persons
turned
and
advanced
upon
ling
with
whirling
daggers
discussing
among
themselves
whether
it
would
be
better
to
kill
him
at
the
first
blow
or
to
take
him
alive
and
when
the
day
had
become
sufficiently
cool
for
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
spectacle
submit
him
to
various
objectionable
tortures
of
so
degraded
a
nature
that
they
were
rarely
used
in
the
army
of
the
emperor
except
upon
the
persons
of
barbarians
observing
that
the
maiden
was
not
bound
ling
cried
out
to
her
to
escape
and
seek
protection
within
the
town
adding
with
a
magnanimous
absence
of
vanity
this
person
chance
to
fall
the
repose
which
the
presence
of
so
lovely
and
graceful
a
being
would
undoubtedly
bring
to
his
departing
spirit
would
be
by
the
unendurable
thought
that
his
commonplace
efforts
had
not
been
sufficient
to
save
her
from
the
two
individuals
who
are
as
he
perceives
at
this
moment
neglecting
no
means
within
their
power
to
accomplish
his
accepting
the
discernment
of
these
words
the
maiden
fled
first
bestowing
a
look
upon
ling
which
clearly
indicated
an
honourable
regard
for
himself
a
desire
that
the
affair
might
end
profitably
on
his
account
and
an
amiable
hope
that
they
should
meet
again
when
these
subjects
could
be
expressed
more
clearly
between
them
in
the
meantime
ling
had
become
at
a
disadvantage
for
the
time
occupied
in
speaking
and
in
making
the
necessary
number
of
bows
in
reply
to
her
entrancing
glance
had
given
the
other
persons
an
opportunity
of
arranging
their
charms
and
sacred
written
sentences
to
greater
advantage
and
of
occupying
the
most
favourable
ground
for
the
encounter
nevertheless
so
great
was
the
force
of
the
new
emotion
which
had
entered
into
nature
that
without
waiting
to
consider
the
dangers
or
the
best
method
of
attack
he
rushed
upon
them
waving
his
sword
with
such
force
that
he
appeared
as
though
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
very
brilliant
fire
in
this
way
he
reached
the
rebels
who
both
fell
unexpectedly
at
one
blow
they
indeed
being
under
the
impression
that
the
encounter
had
not
commenced
in
reality
and
that
ling
was
merely
menacing
them
in
order
to
inspire
their
minds
with
terror
and
raise
his
own
spirits
however
much
he
regretted
this
act
of
the
incident
which
he
had
been
compelled
to
take
ling
could
not
avoid
being
filled
with
intellectual
joy
at
finding
that
his
own
charms
and
omens
were
more
distinguished
than
those
possessed
by
the
rebels
none
of
whom
as
he
now
plainly
understood
he
need
fear
examining
these
things
within
his
mind
and
reflecting
on
the
events
of
the
past
few
days
by
which
he
had
been
thrown
into
a
class
of
circumstances
greatly
differing
from
anything
which
he
had
ever
sought
ling
continued
his
journey
and
soon
found
himself
before
the
southern
gate
of
entering
the
town
he
at
once
formed
the
resolution
of
going
before
the
mandarin
for
warlike
deeds
and
arrangements
so
that
he
might
present
without
delay
the
papers
and
seals
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
canton
noble
mandarin
li
keen
replied
the
first
person
to
whom
ling
addressed
himself
would
indeed
be
a
difficult
and
hazardous
conjecture
to
make
concerning
his
sacred
person
by
chance
he
is
in
the
strongest
and
cellar
in
unless
the
sumptuous
attractions
of
the
deepest
dry
well
have
induced
him
to
make
a
short
and
with
a
look
of
great
unfriendliness
at
dress
and
weapons
this
person
passed
on
he
is
fighting
against
the
armed
men
by
whom
the
place
is
surrounded
said
another
perhaps
he
is
constructing
an
underground
road
from
the
yamen
to
peking
so
that
we
may
all
escape
when
the
town
is
taken
all
that
can
be
said
with
certainty
is
that
the
and
valorous
mandarin
has
not
been
seen
outside
the
walls
of
his
residence
since
the
trouble
arose
but
as
you
carry
a
sword
of
conspicuous
excellence
you
will
doubtless
be
upon
making
a
third
attempt
ling
was
more
successful
for
he
inquired
of
an
aged
woman
who
had
neither
a
reputation
for
keen
and
polished
sentences
to
maintain
nor
any
interest
in
the
acts
of
the
mandarin
or
of
the
rebels
from
her
he
learned
how
to
reach
the
yamen
and
accordingly
turned
his
footsteps
in
that
direction
when
at
length
he
arrived
at
the
gate
ling
desired
his
tablets
to
be
carried
to
the
mandarin
with
many
expressions
of
an
impressive
and
engaging
nature
nor
did
he
neglect
to
reward
the
porter
it
was
therefore
with
the
expression
of
a
misunderstanding
mind
that
he
received
a
reply
setting
forth
that
li
keen
was
unable
to
receive
him
in
great
doubt
he
prevailed
upon
the
porter
by
means
of
a
still
larger
reward
again
to
carry
in
his
message
and
on
this
occasion
an
answer
in
this
detail
was
placed
before
him
keen
he
was
informed
indeed
awaiting
the
arrival
of
one
ling
a
noble
and
valiant
commander
of
bowmen
he
is
given
to
understand
it
is
true
that
a
certain
person
claiming
the
same
honoured
name
is
standing
in
somewhat
undignified
attitudes
at
the
gate
but
he
is
unable
in
any
way
to
make
these
two
individuals
meet
within
his
intellect
he
would
further
remind
all
persons
that
the
refined
observances
laid
down
by
the
wise
and
exalted
board
of
rites
and
ceremonies
have
a
marked
and
irreproachable
significance
when
the
country
is
in
a
state
of
disorder
the
town
surrounded
by
rebels
and
every
of
time
of
more
than
ordinary
overpowered
with
becoming
shame
at
having
been
connected
with
so
unseemly
a
breach
of
civility
for
which
his
great
haste
had
in
reality
been
accountable
ling
hastened
back
into
the
town
and
spent
many
hours
endeavouring
to
obtain
a
chair
of
the
requisite
colour
in
which
to
visit
the
mandarin
in
this
he
was
unsuccessful
until
it
was
at
length
suggested
to
him
that
an
ordinary
chair
such
as
stood
for
hire
in
the
streets
of
would
be
acceptable
if
covered
with
blue
paper
still
in
some
doubt
as
to
what
the
nature
of
his
reception
would
be
ling
had
no
choice
but
to
take
this
course
and
accordingly
he
again
reached
the
yamen
in
such
a
manner
carried
by
two
persons
whom
he
had
obtained
for
the
purpose
while
yet
hardly
at
the
residence
a
salute
was
suddenly
fired
all
the
gates
and
doors
were
without
delay
thrown
open
with
embarrassing
and
hospitable
profusion
and
the
mandarin
himself
passed
out
and
would
have
assisted
ling
to
step
down
from
his
chair
had
not
that
person
clearly
perceiving
that
such
a
course
would
be
too
great
an
honour
evaded
him
by
an
unobtrusive
display
of
versatile
dexterity
so
numerous
and
profound
were
the
graceful
remarks
which
each
made
concerning
the
habits
and
accomplishments
of
the
other
that
more
than
the
space
of
an
hour
was
passed
in
traversing
the
small
enclosed
ground
which
led
up
to
the
principal
door
of
the
yamen
there
an
almost
greater
time
was
agreeably
spent
both
ling
and
the
mandarin
having
determined
that
the
other
should
enter
first
undoubtedly
ling
who
was
the
more
powerful
of
the
two
would
have
conferred
this
courteous
distinction
upon
li
keen
had
not
that
person
summoned
to
his
side
certain
attendants
who
succeeded
in
frustrating
ling
in
his
intentions
and
in
forcing
him
through
the
doorway
in
spite
of
his
conscientious
protests
against
the
unsurmountable
obligation
under
which
the
circumstance
placed
him
conversing
in
this
intellectual
and
dignified
manner
the
strokes
of
the
gong
passed
unheeded
tea
had
been
brought
into
their
presence
many
times
and
night
had
fallen
before
the
mandarin
allowed
ling
to
refer
to
the
matter
which
had
brought
him
to
the
place
and
to
present
his
written
papers
and
seals
is
a
valuable
privilege
to
have
so
intelligent
a
person
as
the
illustrious
ling
occupying
this
position
remarked
the
mandarin
as
he
returned
the
papers
not
less
so
on
account
of
the
one
who
preceded
him
proving
himself
to
be
a
person
of
feeble
attainments
and
an
unendurable
deficiency
of
one
with
the
li
mental
acquisitions
such
a
person
must
indeed
have
become
excessively
offensive
replied
ling
delicately
as
it
is
truly
said
there
exist
many
thousand
subjects
for
elegant
conversation
there
are
persons
who
can
not
meet
a
cripple
without
talking
about
to
whom
i
have
referred
was
such
a
one
said
li
keen
appreciating
with
an
expression
of
countenance
the
fitness
of
proverb
was
totally
inadequate
to
the
requirements
of
his
position
for
he
possessed
no
military
knowledge
and
was
placed
in
command
by
those
at
peking
as
a
result
of
his
taking
a
high
place
at
one
of
the
examinations
but
more
than
this
although
his
three
years
of
service
were
almost
completed
i
was
quite
unsuccessful
in
convincing
him
that
an
unseemly
degradation
probably
awaited
him
unless
he
could
furnish
me
with
the
means
with
which
to
propitiate
the
persons
in
authority
at
peking
this
he
neglected
to
do
with
obstinate
pertinacity
which
compelled
this
person
to
inquire
within
himself
whether
one
of
so
little
discernment
could
be
trusted
with
an
important
and
arduous
office
after
much
deliberation
this
person
came
to
the
decision
that
the
commander
in
question
was
not
a
fit
person
and
he
therefore
reported
him
to
the
imperial
board
of
punishment
at
peking
as
one
subject
to
frequent
and
periodical
eccentricities
and
possessed
of
less
than
ordinary
intellect
in
consequence
of
this
act
of
justice
the
commander
was
degraded
to
the
rank
of
common
bowman
and
compelled
to
pay
a
heavy
fine
in
was
a
just
and
enlightened
conclusion
of
the
affair
said
ling
in
spite
of
a
deep
feeling
of
no
enthusiasm
one
which
surprisingly
bore
out
your
own
prophecy
in
the
was
an
inspired
warning
to
persons
who
should
chance
to
be
in
a
like
position
at
any
time
replied
li
keen
grasping
and
corrupt
are
those
who
control
affairs
in
peking
that
i
have
no
doubt
they
would
scarcely
hesitate
in
debasing
even
one
so
immaculate
as
the
exceptional
ling
and
placing
him
in
some
laborious
and
civil
department
should
he
not
accede
to
their
extortionate
this
suggestion
did
not
carry
with
it
the
unpleasurable
emotions
which
the
mandarin
anticipated
it
would
the
fierce
instincts
which
had
been
aroused
within
ling
by
the
incident
in
the
cypress
wood
had
died
out
while
his
lamentable
ignorance
of
military
affairs
was
ever
before
his
mind
these
circumstances
together
with
his
naturally
gentle
habits
made
him
regard
such
a
degradation
rather
favourably
than
otherwise
he
was
meditating
within
himself
whether
he
could
arrange
such
a
course
without
delay
when
the
mandarin
continued
however
is
a
possibility
which
is
remote
to
the
extent
of
at
least
two
or
three
years
do
not
therefore
let
so
unpleasing
a
thought
cast
darkness
upon
your
brows
or
remove
the
unparalleled
splendour
of
so
refined
an
occasion
doubtless
the
accomplished
ling
is
a
master
of
the
art
of
for
many
of
our
most
thoughtful
philosophers
have
declared
war
to
be
nothing
but
such
a
game
let
this
and
cumbersome
person
have
an
opportunity
therefore
of
polishing
his
declining
facilities
by
a
pleasant
and
dignified
chapter
v
on
the
next
day
having
completed
his
business
at
the
yamen
ling
left
the
town
and
without
desiring
any
ceremony
quietly
betook
himself
to
his
new
residence
within
the
camp
which
was
situated
among
the
millet
fields
some
distance
from
as
soon
as
his
presence
became
known
all
those
who
occupied
positions
of
command
and
whose
years
of
service
would
shortly
come
to
an
end
hastened
to
present
themselves
before
him
bringing
with
them
offerings
according
to
the
rank
they
held
they
themselves
requiring
a
similar
service
from
those
beneath
them
first
among
these
and
next
in
command
to
ling
himself
was
the
chief
of
bowmen
a
person
whom
ling
observed
with
extreme
satisfaction
to
be
very
powerful
in
body
and
possessing
a
strong
and
dignified
countenance
which
showed
unquestionable
resolution
and
shone
with
a
tenaciousness
of
purpose
thought
ling
as
he
observed
this
noble
and
prepossessing
person
is
one
who
will
be
able
to
assist
me
in
whatever
perplexities
may
arise
never
was
there
an
individual
who
seemed
more
worthy
to
command
and
lead
assuredly
to
him
the
most
intricate
and
prolonged
military
positions
will
be
an
enjoyment
the
most
crafty
stratagems
of
the
enemy
as
the
full
moon
rising
from
behind
a
screen
of
rushes
without
making
any
pretence
of
knowledge
this
person
will
explain
the
facts
of
the
case
to
him
and
place
himself
without
limit
in
his
for
this
purpose
he
therefore
detained
the
chief
of
bowmen
when
the
others
departed
and
complimented
him
with
many
expressive
phrases
on
the
excellence
of
his
appearance
as
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
by
this
means
without
disclosing
the
full
measure
of
his
ignorance
the
person
in
question
might
be
encouraged
to
speak
unrestrainedly
of
the
nature
of
his
exploits
and
perchance
thereby
explain
the
use
of
the
appliances
employed
and
the
meaning
of
the
various
words
of
order
in
all
of
which
details
the
commander
was
as
yet
most
disagreeably
imperfect
in
this
however
he
was
disappointed
for
the
chief
of
bowmen
greatly
to
surprise
received
all
his
polished
sentences
with
somewhat
foolish
smiles
of
great
merely
replying
from
time
to
time
as
he
displayed
his
pigtail
to
greater
advantage
or
rearranged
his
cloak
person
must
really
pray
you
to
desist
the
honour
is
indeed
too
disappointed
in
his
hope
and
not
desiring
after
this
circumstance
to
expose
his
shortcomings
to
one
who
was
obviously
not
of
a
understanding
no
matter
how
great
his
valour
in
war
or
his
knowledge
of
military
affairs
might
be
ling
endeavoured
to
lead
him
to
converse
of
the
bowmen
under
his
charge
in
this
matter
he
was
more
successful
for
the
chief
spoke
at
great
length
and
with
contempt
of
their
inelegance
their
undiscriminating
and
excessive
appetites
and
the
frequent
use
which
they
made
of
low
words
and
gestures
desiring
to
become
acquainted
rather
with
their
methods
of
warfare
than
with
their
domestic
details
ling
inquired
of
him
what
formation
they
relied
upon
when
receiving
the
foemen
is
a
matter
which
has
not
engaged
the
attention
of
this
one
replied
the
chief
with
an
excessive
absence
of
interest
are
so
many
affairs
of
intelligent
dignity
which
can
not
be
put
aside
and
which
occupy
one
from
beginning
to
end
as
an
example
this
person
may
describe
how
the
accomplished
generally
depicted
as
the
dove
of
virtuous
and
attitudes
has
been
scattering
glory
upon
the
hall
of
celestial
harmony
for
many
days
past
it
is
an
enlightened
display
which
the
ling
should
certainly
endeavour
to
dignify
with
his
presence
especially
at
the
portion
where
the
amiable
becomes
revealed
in
the
appearance
of
a
peking
bearer
and
describes
the
manner
and
likenesses
of
certain
persons
chiefly
of
buddha
excessively
merchants
who
feign
to
be
detained
within
peking
on
affairs
of
commerce
maidens
who
attend
at
the
tables
of
and
those
of
both
sexes
who
are
within
the
city
for
the
first
time
to
behold
its
temples
and
open
spaces
who
are
conveyed
from
place
to
place
in
the
the
bowmen
suggested
ling
with
difficulty
restraining
an
undignified
emotion
the
elegant
ling
will
discover
them
to
be
persons
of
deficient
manners
and
quite
unworthy
of
occupying
his
conversation
replied
the
chief
regards
their
methods
if
the
renowned
ling
insists
they
fight
by
means
of
their
bows
with
which
they
discharge
arrows
at
the
foemen
they
themselves
hiding
behind
trees
and
rocks
should
the
enemy
be
undisconcerted
by
the
cloud
of
arrows
and
advance
the
bowmen
are
instructed
to
make
a
last
endeavour
to
frighten
them
back
by
uttering
loud
shouts
and
feigning
the
voices
of
savage
beasts
of
the
forest
and
deadly
beyond
that
inquired
ling
that
there
are
no
instructions
replied
the
chief
bowmen
would
then
naturally
take
to
flight
or
if
such
a
course
became
impossible
run
to
meet
the
enemy
protesting
that
they
were
convinced
of
the
justice
of
their
cause
and
were
determined
to
fight
on
their
side
in
the
it
not
be
of
advantage
to
arm
them
with
cutting
weapons
also
inquired
ling
that
when
all
their
arrows
were
discharged
they
would
still
be
able
to
take
part
in
the
fight
and
not
be
lost
to
us
would
not
be
lost
to
us
of
course
replied
the
chief
we
would
still
be
with
them
but
such
a
course
as
the
one
you
suggest
could
not
fail
to
end
in
dismay
being
as
well
armed
as
ourselves
they
would
then
turn
upon
us
and
having
destroyed
us
proceed
to
establish
leaders
of
their
as
ling
and
the
chief
of
bowmen
conversed
in
this
enlightened
manner
there
arose
a
great
outcry
from
among
the
tents
and
presently
there
entered
to
them
a
spy
who
had
discovered
a
strong
force
of
the
enemy
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
li
away
who
showed
every
indication
of
marching
shortly
in
the
direction
of
in
numbers
alone
he
continued
they
were
greatly
superior
to
the
bowmen
and
all
were
well
armed
the
spreading
of
this
news
threw
the
entire
camp
into
great
confusion
many
protesting
that
the
day
was
not
a
favourable
one
on
which
to
fight
others
crying
that
it
was
their
duty
to
fall
back
on
and
protect
the
women
and
children
in
the
midst
of
this
tumult
the
chief
of
bowmen
returned
to
ling
bearing
in
his
hand
a
written
paper
which
he
regarded
in
uncontrollable
anguish
illustrious
ling
he
cried
restraining
his
grief
with
difficulty
and
leaning
for
support
upon
the
shoulders
of
two
bowmen
prosperous
indeed
are
you
what
greater
misfortune
can
engulf
a
person
who
is
both
an
ambitious
soldier
and
an
affectionate
son
than
to
lose
such
a
chance
of
glory
and
promotion
as
only
occurs
once
within
the
lifetime
and
an
affectionate
and
venerable
father
upon
the
same
day
behold
this
mandate
to
attend
without
a
delay
at
the
funeral
obsequies
of
one
whom
i
left
only
last
week
in
the
fullness
of
health
and
power
the
occasion
being
an
unsuitable
one
i
will
not
call
upon
the
courteous
ling
to
join
me
in
sorrow
but
his
own
devout
filial
piety
is
so
well
known
that
i
can
conscientiously
rely
upon
an
application
for
absence
to
be
only
a
matter
of
official
application
will
certainly
be
regarded
as
merely
official
ceremony
replied
ling
without
resorting
to
any
delicate
pretence
of
meaning
the
refined
scruples
of
the
person
who
is
addressing
me
will
be
fully
met
by
the
official
date
of
his
venerated
death
being
fixed
for
a
more
convenient
season
in
the
meantime
the
unobtrusive
chief
of
bowmen
may
take
the
opportunity
of
requesting
that
the
family
tomb
be
kept
unsealed
until
he
is
heard
from
ling
turned
away
as
he
finished
this
remark
with
a
dignified
feeling
of
not
inelegant
resentment
in
this
way
he
chanced
to
observe
a
large
body
of
soldiers
which
was
leaving
the
camp
accompanied
by
their
lesser
captains
all
crowned
with
garlands
of
flowers
and
creeping
plants
in
spite
of
his
very
inadequate
attainments
regarding
words
of
order
the
commander
made
it
understood
by
means
of
an
exceedingly
short
sentence
that
he
was
desirous
of
the
men
returning
without
delay
the
accomplished
commander
being
but
newly
arrived
in
this
neighbourhood
is
unacquainted
with
the
significance
of
this
display
said
one
of
the
lesser
captains
pleasantly
then
o
wise
and
ling
that
on
a
similar
day
many
years
ago
this
valiant
band
of
bowmen
was
engaged
in
a
very
honourable
affair
with
certain
of
the
enemy
since
then
it
has
been
the
practice
to
commemorate
the
matter
with
music
and
other
forms
of
delight
within
the
large
square
at
customs
are
excellent
said
ling
affably
this
occasion
however
the
public
square
will
be
so
insufferably
thronged
with
the
number
of
timorous
and
credulous
villagers
who
have
pressed
into
the
town
that
insufficient
justice
would
be
paid
to
your
entrancing
display
in
consequence
of
this
we
will
select
for
the
purpose
some
convenient
spot
in
the
neighbourhood
the
proceedings
will
be
commenced
by
a
display
of
at
moving
objects
followed
by
racing
and
dancing
in
which
this
person
will
lead
i
have
at
these
words
many
of
the
more
courageous
among
the
bowmen
became
destructively
inspired
and
raised
shouts
of
defiance
against
the
enemy
enumerating
at
great
length
the
indignities
which
they
would
heap
upon
their
prisoners
cries
of
distinction
were
also
given
on
behalf
of
ling
even
the
more
terrified
exclaiming
noble
commander
ling
will
lead
us
he
has
promised
and
assuredly
he
will
not
depart
from
his
word
shielded
by
his
broad
and
sacred
body
from
which
the
bullets
glance
aside
harmlessly
we
will
advance
upon
the
enemy
in
the
stealthy
manner
affected
by
ducks
when
crossing
the
swamp
how
altogether
superior
a
person
our
commander
is
when
likened
unto
the
leaders
of
the
foemen
they
who
go
into
battle
completely
surrounded
by
their
archers
upon
this
perceiving
the
clear
direction
in
which
matters
were
turning
the
chief
of
bowmen
again
approached
ling
the
person
whom
i
am
now
addressing
has
been
endowed
with
exceptional
authority
direct
from
peking
he
remarked
with
insidious
politeness
this
individual
would
suggest
that
such
a
decision
does
not
come
within
the
judgment
of
a
in
his
ignorance
of
military
matters
it
had
not
entered
the
mind
of
ling
that
his
authority
did
not
give
him
the
power
to
commence
an
attack
without
consulting
other
and
more
distinguished
persons
at
the
suggestion
which
he
accepted
as
being
composed
of
truth
he
paused
the
enlightened
zeal
with
which
he
had
been
inspired
dying
out
as
he
plainly
understood
the
difficulties
by
which
he
was
enclosed
there
seemed
a
single
expedient
path
for
him
in
the
matter
so
directing
a
person
of
exceptional
trustworthiness
to
prepare
himself
for
a
journey
he
inscribed
a
communication
to
the
mandarin
li
keen
in
which
he
narrated
the
facts
and
asked
for
speedy
directions
and
then
despatched
it
with
great
urgency
to
chapter
vi
when
these
matters
were
arranged
ling
returned
to
his
tent
a
victim
to
feelings
of
a
deep
and
confused
doubt
for
all
courses
seemed
to
be
surrounded
by
extreme
danger
with
the
strong
possibility
of
final
disaster
while
he
was
considering
these
things
attentively
the
spy
who
had
brought
word
of
the
presence
of
the
enemy
again
sought
him
as
he
entered
ling
perceived
that
his
face
was
the
colour
of
a
bleached
linen
garment
while
there
came
with
him
the
odour
of
sickness
are
certain
matters
which
this
person
has
not
made
known
he
said
having
first
expressed
a
request
that
he
might
not
be
compelled
to
stand
while
he
conversed
bowmen
are
as
an
inferior
kind
of
jackal
and
they
who
lead
them
are
pigs
but
this
person
has
observed
that
the
commander
has
internal
organs
like
steel
hardened
in
a
white
fire
and
polished
by
running
water
for
this
reason
he
will
narrate
to
him
the
things
he
has
seen
things
at
which
the
lesser
ones
would
undoubtedly
perish
in
terror
without
offering
to
strike
a
said
ling
fear
and
without
numbers
the
rebels
are
as
three
to
one
with
the
bowmen
and
are
in
addition
armed
with
matchlocks
and
other
weapons
this
much
i
have
already
told
said
the
spy
they
entered
the
village
of
ki
without
resistance
as
the
dwellers
there
were
all
peaceable
persons
who
gain
a
living
from
the
fields
and
who
neither
understood
nor
troubled
about
the
matters
between
the
rebels
and
the
army
relying
on
the
promises
made
by
the
rebel
chiefs
the
villagers
even
welcomed
them
as
they
had
been
assured
that
they
came
as
buyers
of
their
corn
and
rice
not

desired

the
moment

hung
from
the
trees
as
marks
for
their
arrows
of
the
women
and
children
this
person
who
has
since
been
subject
to
several
attacks
of
fainting
and
vomiting
desires
not
to
speak
the
wells
of
ki
are
filled
with
the
bodies
of
such
as
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
warned
in

to
slay
themselves

thickened
into

all
these
things
this
person
has
when
he
had
finished
speaking
ling
remained
in
deep
and
funereal
thought
for
some
time
in
spite
of
his
mild
nature
the
words
which
he
had
heard
filled
him
with
an
inextinguishable
desire
to
slay
in
fighting
he
regretted
that
he
had
placed
the
decision
of
the
matter
before
li
keen
only
this
person

a
mere
handful
of
brave
and
expert
warriors

would
not
hesitate
to
fall
upon
those
savage
and
barbarous
characters
and
either
destroy
them
to
the
last
one
or
let
his
band
suffer
a
like
fate
he
murmured
to
himself
the
return
of
the
messenger
found
him
engaged
in
reviewing
the
bowmen
and
still
in
this
mood
so
that
it
was
with
a
commendable
feeling
of
satisfaction
no
less
than
virtuous
contempt
that
he
learned
of
the
journey
to
peking
as
soon
as
he
understood
that
the
rebels
were
certainly
in
the
neighbourhood
wise
and
ornamental
li

undoubtedly
consistent
in
all
matters

return
to

li
of

informed
by
the
spies
that
no

of

accurate
and
bold
spies
to
reach
them
with
trustworthy
information
regarding

of

with
little
delay
there
returned
the
one
who
had
brought
the
earliest
tidings
bruised
and
torn
with
his
successful
haste
through
the
forest
but
wearing
a
complacent
and
expression
of
countenance
without
hesitation
or
waiting
to
demand
money
before
he
would
reveal
his
knowledge
he
at
once
disclosed
that
the
greater
part
of
the
enemy
were
rejoicing
among
the
ruins
of

having
discovered
there
a
quantity
of
opium
and
a
variety
of
liquids

their
weapons

from

ground
in
gladness
so
great
was
his
certainty
of
destroying
the
invaders
utterly
it
was
however
with
less
pleasurable
emotions
that
he
considered
how
he
should
effect
the
matter
for
it
was
in
no
way
advisable
to
divide
his
numbers
into
two
bands
without
any
feeling
of
unendurable
conceit
he
understood
that
no
one
but
himself
could
hold
the
bowmen
before
an
assault
however
weak
in
a
similar
manner
he
determined
that
it
would
be
more
advisable
to
attack
those
in
the
village
first
these
he
might
have
reasonable
hopes
of
cutting
down
without
warning
the
camp
or
in
any
event

those
from
the

arrived
to

assuredly
by
the
firing
draw
upon
them
those
from

in
whatever
evil
state
these
might
arrive
they
would
by

terrify

chapter

between
and
the
village
of
ki
in
a
house
completely
hidden
from
travellers
by
the
tall
and
black
trees
which
surrounded
it
lived
an
aged
and
very
wise
person
whose
ways
and
manner
of
living
had
become
so
distasteful
to
his
neighbours
that
they
at
length
agreed
to
regard
him
as
a
powerful
and
magician
in
this
way
it
became
a
custom
that
all
very
unseemly
deeds
committed
by
those
who
in
the
ordinary
course
would
not
be
guilty
of
such
behaviour
should
be
attributed
to
his
influence
so
that
justice
might
be
effected
without
persons
of
assured
respectability
being
put
to
any
inconvenience
apart
from
the
feeling
which
resulted
from
this
just
decision
the
uncongenial
person
in
question
had
become
exceedingly
unpopular
on
account
of
certain
definite
actions
of
his
own
as
that
of
causing
the
greater
part
of
to
be
burned
down
by
secretly
breathing
upon
the
seven
sacred
to
which
the
town
owed
its
prosperity
and
freedom
from
fire
furthermore
although
possessed
of
many
taels
and
able
to
afford
such
food
as
is
to
be
found
upon
the
tables
of
mandarins
he
selected
from
choice
dishes
of
an
objectionable
nature
he
had
been
observed
to
eat
eggs
of
unbecoming
freshness
and
the
official
printed
leaf
made
it
public
that
he
had
on
an
excessively
hot
occasion
openly
partaken
of
milk
it
is
not
a
matter
for
wonder
therefore
that
when
unnaturally
loud
thunder
was
heard
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
more
ignorant
and
credulous
persons
refused
to
continue
in
any
description
of
work
until
certain
ceremonies
connected
with
rice
spirit
and
the
adherence
to
a
reclining
position
for
some
hours
had
been
conscientiously
observed
as
a
protection
against
evil
not
even
the
most
venerable
person
in
could
remember
the
time
when
the
magician
had
not
lived
there
and
as
there
existed
no
written
record
narrating
the
incident
it
was
with
probability
that
he
was
said
to
be
incapable
of
death
contrary
to
the
most
general
practice
although
quite
unmarried
he
had
adopted
no
son
to
found
a
line
which
would
worship
his
memory
in
future
years
but
had
instead
brought
up
and
caused
to
be
educated
in
the
most
difficult
varieties
of
embroidery
a
young
girl
to
whom
he
referred
for
want
of
a
more
suitable
description
as
the
daughter
of
his
sister
although
he
would
admit
without
hesitation
when
closely
questioned
that
he
had
never
possessed
a
sister
at
the
same
time
however
alluding
with
some
pride
to
many
illustrious
brothers
who
had
all
obtained
distinction
in
various
employments
few
persons
of
any
high
position
penetrated
into
the
house
of
the
magician
and
most
of
these
retired
with
inelegant
haste
on
perceiving
that
no
domestic
altar
embellished
the
great
hall
indeed
not
to
make
concealment
of
the
fact
the
magician
was
a
person
who
had
entirely
neglected
the
higher
virtues
in
an
avaricious
pursuit
of
wealth
in
that
way
all
his
time
and
a
very
large
number
of
taels
had
been
expended
testing
results
by
means
of
the
four
elements
and
putting
together
things
which
had
been
inadequately
arrived
at
by
others
it
was
confidently
asserted
in
that
he
possessed
every
manner
of
printed
leaf
which
had
been
composed
in
whatsoever
language
and
all
the
most
precious
charms
including
many
of
more
than
ordinary
rarity
and
the
fang
of
a
black
wolf
which
had
been
stung
by
seven
scorpions
on
the
death
of
his
father
the
magician
had
become
possessed
of
great
wealth
yet
he
contributed
little
to
the
funeral
obsequies
nor
did
any
suggestion
of
a
durable
and
expensive
nature
conveying
his
enlightened
name
and
virtues
down
to
future
times
cause
his
face
to
become
gladdened
in
order
to
preserve
greater
secrecy
about
the
enchantments
which
he
certainly
performed
he
employed
only
two
persons
within
the
house
one
of
whom
was
blind
and
the
other
deaf
in
this
ingenious
manner
he
hoped
to
receive
attention
and
yet
be
unobserved
the
blind
one
being
unable
to
see
the
nature
of
the
incantations
which
he
undertook
and
the
deaf
one
being
unable
to
hear
the
words
in
this
however
he
was
unsuccessful
as
the
two
persons
always
contrived
to
be
present
together
and
to
explain
to
one
another
the
nature
of
the
various
matters
afterwards
but
as
they
were
of
somewhat
deficient
understanding
the
circumstance
was
unimportant
it
was
with
more
uneasiness
that
the
magician
perceived
one
day
that
the
maiden
whom
he
had
adopted
was
no
longer
a
child
as
he
desired
secrecy
above
all
things
until
he
should
have
completed
the
one
important
matter
for
which
he
had
laboured
all
his
life
he
decided
with
extreme
unwillingness
to
put
into
operation
a
powerful
charm
towards
her
which
would
have
the
effect
of
diminishing
all
her
attributes
until
such
time
as
he
might
release
her
again
owing
to
his
reluctance
in
the
matter
however
the
magic
did
not
act
fully
but
only
in
such
a
way
that
her
feet
became
naturally
and
without
binding
the
most
perfect
and
beautiful
in
the
entire
province
of
hu
nan
so
that
ever
afterwards
she
was
called
pan
fei
mian
in
delicate
reference
to
that
empress
whose
feet
were
so
symmetrical
that
a
golden
lily
sprang
up
wherever
she
trod
afterwards
the
magician
made
no
further
essay
in
the
matter
chiefly
because
he
was
ever
convinced
that
the
accomplishment
of
his
desire
was
within
his
grasp
the
rumours
of
armed
men
in
the
neighbourhood
of
threw
the
magician
into
an
unendurable
condition
of
despair
to
lose
all
as
would
most
assuredly
happen
if
he
had
to
leave
his
arranged
rooms
and
secret
preparations
and
take
to
flight
was
the
more
bitter
because
he
felt
surer
than
ever
that
success
was
even
standing
by
his
side
the
very
subtle
liquid
which
would
mix
itself
into
the
component
parts
of
the
living
creature
which
drank
it
and
by
an
insidious
and
harmless
process
so
work
that
when
the
spirit
departed
the
flesh
would
become
resolved
into
a
figure
of
pure
and
solid
gold
of
the
finest
quality
had
engaged
the
refined
minds
of
many
of
the
most
expert
individuals
of
remote
ages
with
most
of
these
inspired
persons
however
the
search
had
been
undertaken
in
benevolence
their
chief
aim
being
an
honourable
desire
to
discover
a
method
by
which
ancestors
might
be
permanently
and
effectively
preserved
in
a
fit
and
becoming
manner
to
receive
the
worship
and
veneration
of
posterity
yet
in
spite
of
these
amiable
motives
and
of
the
fact
that
the
magician
merely
desired
the
possession
of
the
secret
to
enable
him
to
become
excessively
wealthy
the
affair
had
been
so
arranged
that
it
should
come
into
his
possession
the
matter
which
concerned
mian
in
the
dark
wood
when
she
was
only
saved
by
the
appearance
of
the
person
who
is
already
known
as
ling
entirely
removed
all
pleasurable
emotions
from
the
mind
and
on
many
occasions
he
stated
in
a
definite
and
systematic
manner
that
he
would
shortly
end
an
ignoble
career
which
seemed
to
be
destined
only
to
gloom
and
disappointment
in
this
way
an
important
misunderstanding
arose
for
when
two
days
later
during
the
sound
of
matchlock
firing
the
magician
suddenly
approached
the
presence
of
mian
with
an
uncontrollable
haste
and
an
entire
absence
of
dignified
demeanour
and
fell
dead
at
her
feet
without
expressing
himself
on
any
subject
whatever
she
deliberately
judged
that
in
this
manner
he
had
carried
his
remark
into
effect
nor
did
the
closed
vessel
of
yellow
liquid
which
he
held
in
his
hand
seem
to
lead
away
from
this
decision
in
reality
the
magician
had
fallen
owing
to
the
heavy
and
conflicting
emotions
which
success
had
engendered
in
an
intellect
already
greatly
weakened
by
his
continual
disregard
of
the
higher
virtues
for
the
bottle
indeed
contained
the
perfection
of
his
entire
study
the
very
expensive
and
purified
gold

perceiving
the
condition

once

for
the
two
attendants
and
directed
them
to
bring
from
an
inner
chamber
all
the
most
effective
curing
substances
whether
in
the
form
of
powder
or
liquid
when
these
proved
useless
no
matter
in
what
way
they
were
applied
it
became
evident
that
there
could
be
very
little
hope
of
restoring
the
magician
yet
so
courageous
and
grateful
for
the
benefits
which
she
had
received
from
the
person
in
question
was
mian
that
in
spite
of
the
uninviting
dangers
of
the
enterprise
she
determined
to
journey
to
ki
to
invoke
the
assistance
of
a
certain
person
who
was
known
to
be
very
successful
in
casting
out
malicious
demons
from
the
bodies
of
animals
and
from
casks
and
barrels
in
which
they
frequently
took
refuge
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
quality
of
the
liquid
placed
therein
not
without
many
hidden
fears
mian
set
out
on
her
journey
greatly
desiring
not
to
be
subjected
to
an
encounter
of
a
nature
similar
to
the
one
already
recorded
for
in
such
a
case
she
could
hardly
again
hope
for
the
inspired
arrival
of
the
one
whom
she
now
often
thought
of
in
secret
as
the
and
symmetrical
young
nevertheless
an
event
of
equal
significance
was
destined
to
prove
the
wisdom
of
the
remark
concerning
thoughts
which
are
occupying
intellect
and
the
unexpected
appearance
of
a
very
formidable
evil
spirit
for
as
she
passed
along
quickly
yet
with
so
dignified
a
motion
that
the
moss
received
no
impression
beneath
her
footsteps
she
became
aware
of
a
circumstance
which
caused
her
to
stop
by
imparting
to
her
mind
two
definite
and
greatly
dissimilar
emotions
in
a
grassy
and
open
space
on
the
verge
of
which
she
stood

the
dead
bodies
of
seventeen
rebels
all
disposed
in
very
degraded
attitudes
which
contrasted
strongly
with
the
easy
and
becoming
position
adopted
by
the
eighteenth
one
who
bore
the
unmistakable
emblems
of
the
imperial
army

brave
and
personage

arms

well
assured
that
however
indiscreet

an
action

appear

the
case

ordinary

honourable

after

again
opened
his

to
find
himself
in

to
recognize
in
the
one

him
from

the
incomparable

without

be

shook
off
the
evil

him
down

was

to
walk
slowly
in

in

of

upon

been
before
your

during
your
residence

and
your
naturally
benevolent
mind
has
turned
all
things
into
good
or
you
would
not
thus
hopefully
refer
to
your
brilliant
exploits
in
the
past
of
what
commercial
benefit
have
they
been
to
the
sordid
and
miserly
persons
in
authority
or
in
what
way
have
they
diverted
a
stream
of
taels
into
their
insatiable
pockets
far
greater
is
the
chance
that

fallen
many
of
its
household
goods
would
have
found
their
way
into
the
yamens
of
canton
assuredly
in

you
will
have
a
friend
who
will
make
many
delicate
allusions
to
your
ancestors
when
you
meet
and
yet
one
who
will
float
many
barbed
whispers
to
follow
you
when
you
have
passed
for
you
have
planted
shame
before
him
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
would
otherwise
neither
have
eyes
to
see
nor
tongues
to
discuss
the
matter
it
is
for
such
a
reason
that
this
person
distrusts
all
things
connected
with
the
journey
except
your
constancy
oh
my
true
and
strong
faithfulness
would
alone
be
sufficient
to
assure
my
safe
return
if
the

were
properly
represented
to
the
supreme

thin
curtain

followed

another
in
the
past
few
days
in
a
fashion
that
can
only
be

to
thunder

indeed
sufficient
to
distress

so
refined
and
an
organization

they
are

a
hope
of
daily
recurrence
to
this
person
replied

honourably
endeavouring
to
restrain
the
emotion
which
openly
exhibited
itself
in
her
eyes
what
maiden
would
not
rather
make
successful
offerings
to
the
great
mother
than
have
the
most
imposing
and
verbose
triumphal
arch
erected
to
commemorate
an
empty
and
unsatisfying
constancy
in
this
amiable
manner
the
matter
was
arranged
between
ling
and
mian
as
they
sat
together
in
the
garden
drinking
which
the
two
attendants
not
without
discriminating
and
significant
expressions
between
themselves
brought
to
them
from
time
to
time
here
ling
made
clear
the
whole
manner
of
his
life
from
his
earliest
memory
to
the
time
when
he
fell
in
dignified
combat
nor
did
mian
withhold
anything
explaining
in
particular
such
charms
and
spells
of
the
magician
as
she
had
knowledge
of
and
in
this
graceful
manner
materially
assisting
her
lover
in
the
many
disagreeable
encounters
and
conflicts
which
he
was
shortly
to
experience
it
was
with
even
more
objectionable
feelings
than
before
that
ling
now
contemplated
his
journey
to
canton
involving
as
it
did
the
separation
from
one
who
had
become
as
the
shadow
of
his
existence
and
by
whose
side
he
had
an
undoubted
claim
to
stand
yet
the
necessity
of
the
undertaking
was
no
less
than
before
and
the
full
possession
of
all
his
natural
powers
took
away
his
only
excuse
for
delaying
in
the
matter
without
any
pleasurable
anticipations
therefore
he
consulted
the
sacred
flat
and
round
sticks
and
learning
that
the
following
day
would
be
propitious
for
the
journey
he
arranged
to
set
out
in
accordance
with
the
omen
when
the
final
moment
arrived
at
which
the
invisible
threads
of
constantly
passing
emotions
from
one
to
the
other
must
be
broken
and
when
mian
perceived
that
her
horse
was
restrained
at
the
door
by
the
two
attendants
who
with
unsuspected
delicacy
of
feeling
had
taken
this
opportunity
of
withdrawing
the
noble
endurance
which
had
hitherto
upheld
her
melted
away
and
she
became
involved
in
very
melancholy
and
obscure
meditations
until
she
observed
that
ling
also
was
quickly
becoming
affected
by
a
similar
gloom
she
exclaimed
unworthy
a
person
i
am
thus
to
impose
upon
my
lord
a
greater
burden
than
that
which
already
weighs
him
down
rather
ought
this
one
to
dwell
upon
the
happiness
of
that
day
when
after
successfully
evading
or
overthrowing
the
numerous
bands
of
assassins
which
infest
the
road
from
here
to
canton
and
after
escaping
or
recovering
from
the
many
deadly
pestilences
which
invariably
reduce
that
city

this
season
of
the
year

triumphantly
return

there
is
a
surface
united
to
every
action
in
life
no
matter
how
funereal
it
may
at
first
appear
indeed
there
are
many
incidents
compared
with
which
death
itself
is
welcome

to
this
end

has
reserved
a
farewell

in

manner

magnanimous

transparent

the

had
grasped
when

she
continued
speaking
with
difficulty
her
welfare
incomparably
before
her

happiness

ever
find
himself
in

situation
which
is
unendurably
oppressive
and
from
which
death
is
the
only
escape

infliction
of
violent
madness
or
the
subjection
by
magic
to
the
will
of
some
designing
woman
she
begs
him
to
accept
this
means
of
freeing
himself
without
regarding
her
anguish
beyond
expressing
a
clearly
defined
last
wish
that
the
two
persons
in
question
may
be
in
the
end
happily
reunited
in
another

by
this
last
evidence
of
affection

that
he
had
no
longer
any
reason
for
internal
heaviness
his
spirits
were
immeasurably
raised
by
the
fragrant
incense
of
great
devotion
and
under
its
influence
he
was
even
able
to
breathe
towards
her
a
few
words
of
similar
comfort
as
he
left
the
spot
and
began
his
journey
chapter
ix
on
entering

he
successfully
accomplished
without

adventure
the
marked
absence
of
any
dignified
ostentation

had
been
accountable
for
many
of
misfortunes

again
to
reside
in

insignificant

occupied

visited

an
unknown
and

by
the
lower

for
this
reason
he
was
not
always
treated
with
the
regard
to
which
his
attainments
entitled
him
or
which
he
would
have
unquestionably
received
had
he
been
able
to
describe
himself
as
of
and
uninfected
area
reserved
to
mandarins

their
it
was
with
an
ignoble
feeling
of
mental
distress

exhibited
himself
at
the
chief
office

warlike
deeds
and
arrangements
on
the
following
day

the
many
disadvantageous
incidents
of
his
past
life

repeated
themselves
before
his
eyes
while
he
slept
and
the
not
unhopeful
emotions
which
he
had
felt
when

the
inspiring
presence

were
now
altogether
absent

of
the
fact
that
he
reached

the
morning
it
was

the
matter

numerous

the
lesser
ones
through
whose
chambers
he
had
to
pass
in
the
process

he
found
himself
in
the
presence

an
upper

the
appearance
of
being
acquainted
with

who
received

with

closely
no

at

recovering

set
forth
in
the
amiable
and
impartial

which
we
have
lately
received
from

these

plainly
understood
that
there

who
thrice
led

the
fighting

who
was
finally
successful

causing

disperse

he
asked
in
a
voice
which
somewhat
trembled

certainly
reference
to
one
of
the
name

mention

the

the
terms
perhaps
this
person
would
better
protect
his
own
estimable
time
by
displaying
the
report
within
your
with
these
words
the
upper
one
struck
a
gong
several
times
and
after
receiving
from
an
inner
chamber
the
parchment

he
placed
it
before

the

a
lesser

skilfully
inscribed

the
evident
purpose

inducing
persons
to

without

that

so
elegantly
traced
must
of
necessity
be
truthful

a
benevolent
example

the
intelligent
arrangement

most
worthy

the
valuable
and
accomplished
mandarin
of
warlike
deeds
and
arrangements
at
have
in
recent
times
been
of
anything
but
a
prepossessing
order
owing
to
the
very
inadequate
methods
adopted
by
those
who
earn
a
livelihood
by
conveying
necessities
from
the
more
enlightened
portions
of
the

that
place

so
came
about
that
for
a
period
of
five
days
the

was
entirely
unsupplied
with
the
fins
of

even
with

the
polished

barbarous

the
feeble
and
commonplace
person

but
recently
been
elevated
to
that
distinguished
position
from
a
menial
and
degraded
occupation
for
which
indeed
his
stunted
intellect
more
aptly
fitted
him
and
being
in
consequence
very
greatly
puffed
out
in
he
became
an
easy
prey
to
the
cunning
of
the
rebels

allowed
himself
to
be
beguiled
into
a
trap
paying
for
this
contemptible
stupidity
with
his
life
the

and
irreproachable
resistance

told
as
covered
with
the
blood
of
the
foemen
he
was
dragged
away
from
the
thickest
part

the
unequal
conflict
by
his
followers
that
he
was
the
last
person
to
leave
the
town
on
his
way
to
peking
with
news
of
this
valiant
defence
the
mandarin
was
joined
by
the
chief
of
bowmen
who
had
understood
and
avoided
the
very
obvious
snare
into
which
the
commander
had
led
his
followers
in
spite
of
disinterested
advice
to
the
contrary
for
this
intelligent
perception
and
for
general
nobility
of
conduct
when
in
battle
the
versatile
chief
of
bowmen
is
by
this
written
paper
strongly
recommended
to
the
dignity
of
receiving
the
small
metal
embellishment
of
valour
it
has
been
suggested
to
the
mandarin
li

that
the
bestowal
of
the
crystal
button
would
only
be
a
fit
and
graceful
reward
for
his
indefatigable
efforts
to
uphold
the
dignity
of
the
sublime
emperor
but
to
all
such
persons
the
mandarin
has
sternly
replied
that
such
a
proposal
would
more
fitly
originate
from
the
renowned
and
valuable
office
of
warlike
deeds
and
arrangements
he
well
knowing
that
the
wise
and
engaging
persons
who
conduct
that
indispensable
and
department
are
gracefully
voracious
in
their
efforts
to
reward
merit
even
when
it
is
displayed
as
in
the
case
in
question
by
one
who
from
his
position
will
inevitably
soon
be
urgently
petitioning
in
a
like
manner
on
their
behalf
when
ling
had
finished
reading
this
elegantly
arranged
but
exceedingly
misleading
parchment
he
looked
up
with
eyes
from
which
he
vainly
endeavoured
to
restrain
the
signs
of
undignified
emotion
and
said
to
the
upper
one
is
difficult
employment
for
a
person
to
refrain
from
unendurable
thoughts
when
his
unassuming
and
really
conscientious
efforts
are
represented
in
a
spirit
of
no
satisfaction
yet
in
this
matter
the
very
expert
li
keen
appears
to
have
gone
beyond
himself
the
commander
ling
who
is
herein
represented
as
being
slain
by
the
enemy
is
indeed
the
person
who
is
standing
before
you
and
all
the
other
statements
are
in
a
like
individual
who
for
some
hidden
desire
of
his
own
is
endeavouring
to
present
himself
as
the
corrupt
and
degraded
creature
ling
has
overlooked
one
important
circumstance
said
the
upper
one
smiling
in
a
very
intolerable
manner
at
the
same
time
causing
his
head
to
move
slightly
from
side
to
side
in
the
fashion
of
one
who
rebukes
with
assumed
geniality
and
turning
over
the
written
paper
he
displayed
upon
the
under
side
the
imperial
vermilion
sign
he
continued
omniscient
person
will
still
continue
in
his
remarks
even
with
the
evidence
of
the
unerring
pencil
to
refute
at
these
words
and
the
undoubted
testimony
of
the
red
mark
which
plainly
declared
the
whole
of
the
written
matter
to
be
composed
of
truth
no
matter
what
might
afterwards
transpire
ling
understood
that
very
little
prosperity
remained
with
him
the
town
of
he
suggested
after
examining
his
mind
any
person
in
authority
visited
the
place
he
would
inevitably
find
it
standing
and
its
inhabitants
in
agreeable
persistent
person
who
is
so
assiduously
occupying
my
intellectual
moments
with
empty
words
seems
to
be
unaccountably
deficient
in
his
knowledge
of
the
customs
of
refined
society
and
of
the
meaning
of
the
imperial
signet
said
the
other
with
an
entire
absence
of
benevolent
consideration
has
fallen
and
that
ling
is
dead
are
two
utterly
uncontroversial
matters
truthfully
recorded
if
a
person
visited
he
might
find
it
rebuilt
or
even
inhabited
by
those
from
the
neighbouring
villages
or
by
evil
spirits
taking
the
forms
of
the
ones
who
formerly
lived
there
as
in
a
like
manner
ling
might
be
restored
to
existence
by
magic
or
his
body
might
be
found
and
possessed
by
an
outcast
demon
who
desired
to
revisit
the
earth
for
a
period
such
circumstances
do
not
in
any
way
disturb
the
announcement
that
has
without
question
fallen
and
that
ling
has
officially
ceased
to
live
of
which
events
notifications
have
been
sent
to
all
who
are
concerned
in
the
as
the
upper
one
ceased
speaking
four
strokes
sounded
upon
the
gong
and
ling
immediately
found
himself
carried
into
the
street
by
the
current
of
both
lesser
and
upper
ones
who
poured
forth
at
the
signal
the
termination
of
this
conversation
left
ling
in
a
more
unenviable
state
of
dejection
than
any
of
the
many
preceding
misfortunes
had
done
for
with
enlarged
inducements
to
possess
himself
of
a
competent
appointment
he
seemed
to
be
even
further
removed
from
this
attainment
than
he
had
been
at
any
time
in
his
life
he
might
indeed
present
himself
again
for
the
public
examinations
but
in
order
to
do
even
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
wait
almost
a
year
nor
could
he
assure
himself
that
his
efforts
would
again
be
likely
to
result
in
an
equal
success
doubts
also
arose
within
his
mind
of
the
course
which
he
should
follow
in
such
a
case
whether
to
adopt
a
new
name
involving
as
it
would
certain
humiliation
and
perhaps
disgrace
if
detection
overtook
his
footsteps
or
still
to
possess
the
title
of
one
who
was
in
a
measure
dead
and
hazard
the
likelihood
of
having
any
prosperity
which
he
might
obtain
reduced
to
nothing
if
the
fact
should
become
public
as
ling
reflected
upon
such
details
he
found
himself
without
intention
before
the
house
of
a
wise
person
who
had
become
very
wealthy
by
advising
others
on
all
matters
but
chiefly
on
those
connected
with
strange
occurrences
and
such
events
as
could
not
be
settled
definitely
either
one
way
or
the
other
until
a
remote
period
had
been
reached
becoming
assailed
by
a
curious
desire
to
know
what
manner
of
evils
particularly
attached
themselves
to
such
as
were
officially
dead
but
who
nevertheless
had
an
ordinary
existence
ling
placed
himself
before
this
person
and
after
arranging
the
manner
of
reward
related
to
him
so
many
of
the
circumstances
as
were
necessary
to
enable
a
full
understanding
to
be
reached
but
at
the
same
time
in
no
way
betraying
his
own
interest
in
the
matter
inflictions
are
to
no
degree
frequent
said
the
wise
person
after
he
had
consulted
a
polished
sphere
of
the
finest
red
jade
for
some
time
this
is
in
a
measure
to
be
regretted
as
the
hair
of
these
persons
provided
they
die
a
violent
death
which
is
invariably
the
case
constitutes
a
certain
protection
against
being
struck
by
falling
stars
or
becoming
involved
in
unsuccessful
law
cases
the
persons
in
question
can
be
recognized
with
certainty
in
the
public
ways
by
the
unnatural
pallor
of
their
faces
and
by
the
general
repulsiveness
of
their
appearance
but
as
they
soon
take
refuge
in
suicide
unless
they
have
the
fortune
to
be
removed
previously
by
accident
it
is
an
infrequent
matter
that
one
is
gratified
by
the
sight
during
their
existence
they
are
subject
to
many
disorders
from
which
the
generality
of
human
beings
are
benevolently
preserved
they
possess
no
rights
of
any
kind
and
if
by
any
chance
they
are
detected
in
an
act
of
a
seemingly
depraved
nature
they
are
liable
to
judgment
at
the
hands
of
the
without
any
form
whatever
and
to
punishment
of
a
more
severe
order
than
that
administered
to
commonplace
criminals
there
are
many
other
disadvantages
affecting
such
persons
when
they
reach
the
middle
air
of
which
the
chief
person
is
immeasurably
indebted
for
such
a
clear
explanation
of
the
position
interrupted
ling
who
had
a
feeling
of
not
desiring
to
penetrate
further
into
the
detail
as
he
perceives
a
line
of
anxious
ones
eagerly
waiting
at
the
door
to
obtain
advice
and
consolation
from
so
expert
and
amiable
a
wizard
he
will
not
make
himself
uncongenial
any
longer
with
his
very
feeble
topics
of
by
this
time
ling
plainly
comprehended
that
he
had
been
marked
out
from
the
beginning
perhaps
for
all
the
knowledge
which
he
had
to
the
opposite
effect
from
a
period
in
the
life
of
a
ancestor
to
be
an
object
of
marked
derision
and
the
victim
of
all
manner
of
malevolent
demons
in
whatever
actions
he
undertook
in
this
condition
of
understanding
his
mind
turned
gratefully
to
the
parting
gift
of
mian
whom
he
had
now
no
hope
of
possessing
for
the
intolerable
thought
of
uniting
her
to
so
objectionable
a
being
as
himself
would
have
been
dismissed
as
utterly
inelegant
even
had
he
been
in
a
manner
of
living
to
provide
for
her
adequately
which
itself
seemed
clearly
impossible
disregarding
all
similar
emotions
therefore
he
walked
without
pausing
to
his
abode
and
stretching
his
body
upon
the
rushes
drank
the
entire
liquid
unhesitatingly
and
prepared
to
pass
beyond
with
a
tranquil
mind
entirely
given
up
to
thoughts
and
images
of
mian
chapter
x
upon
a
certain
occasion
the
particulars
of
which
have
already
been
recorded
ling
had
judged
himself
to
have
passed
into
the
form
of
a
spirit
on
beholding
the
ethereal
form
of
mian
bending
over
him
after
swallowing
the
entire
liquid
which
had
cost
the
dead
magician
so
much
to
distil
and
make
perfect
it
was
with
a
determination
of
never
again
awakening
that
he
lost
the
outward
senses
and
floated
in
the
middle
air
so
that
when
his
eyes
next
opened
upon
what
seemed
to
be
the
bare
walls
of
his
own
chamber
his
first
thought
was
a
natural
conviction
that
the
matter
had
been
so
arranged
either
out
of
a
charitable
desire
that
he
should
not
be
overcome
by
a
too
sudden
transition
to
unparalleled
splendour
or
that
such
a
reception
was
the
outcome
of
some
dignified
jest
on
the
part
of
certain
lesser
and
more
cheerful
spirits
after
waiting
in
one
position
for
several
hours
however
and
receiving
no
summons
or
manifestation
of
a
celestial
nature
he
began
to
doubt
the
qualities
of
the
liquid
and
applying
certain
tests
he
soon
ascertained
that
he
was
still
in
the
lower
world
and
unharmed
nevertheless
this
circumstance
did
not
tend
in
any
way
to
depress
his
mind
for
doubtless
owing
to
some
hidden
virtue
of
the
fluid
he
felt
an
enjoyable
emotion
that
he
still
lived
all
his
attributes
appeared
to
be
purified
and
he
experienced
an
inspired
certainty
of
feeling
that
an
illustrious
and
future
lay
before
one
who
still
had
an
ordinary
existence
after
being
both
officially
killed
and
in
this
intelligent
disposition
thoughts
of
mian
recurred
to
him
with
unreproved
persistence
and
in
order
to
convey
to
her
an
account
of
the
various
matters
which
had
engaged
him
since
his
arrival
at
the
city
and
a
declaration
of
the
unchanged
state
of
his
own
feelings
towards
her
he
composed
and
despatched
with
impetuous
haste
the
following
delicate
verses

about
the
walls
and
gates
of

many
pleasing
and
entertaining
maidens
indeed
in
the
eyes
of
their
friends
and
of
the
some
of
them
are
exceptionally
adorable
the
person
who
is
inscribing
these
lines
however
sees
before
him
as
it
were
an
assemblage
of
deformed
and
hags
venerable
in
age
and
inconsiderable
in
appearance
for
the
dignified
and
majestic
image
of
mian
is
ever
before
him
making
all
others
very
inferior
within
the
houses
and
streets
of
canton
hang
many
bright
lanterns
the
ordinary
person
who
has
occasion
to
walk
by
night
professes
to
find
them
highly
lustrous
but
there
is
one
who
thinks
contrary
facts
and
when
he
goes
forth
he
carries
two
long
curved
poles
to
prevent
him
from
stumbling
among
the
dark
and
hidden
places
for
he
has
gazed
into
the
brilliant
and
pellucid
orbs
of
mian
and
all
other
lights
are
dull
and
practically
opaque
in
various
parts
of
the
literary
quarter
of

such
as
spend
their
time
in
inward
contemplation
in
spite
of
their
generally
uninviting
exteriors
their
reflexions
are
often
of
a
very
profound
order
yet
the
unpopular
and
ling
would
unhesitatingly
prefer
his
own
thoughts
to
theirs
for
what
makes
this
thoughts
far
more
pleasing
is
that
they
are
invariably
connected
with
the
virtuous
and
ornamental
mian
becoming
very
amiably
disposed
after
this
agreeable
occupation
ling
surveyed
himself
at
the
disc
of
polished
metal
and
observed
with
surprise
and
shame
the
rough
and
uninviting
condition
of
his
person
he
had
indeed
although
it
was
not
until
some
time
later
that
he
became
aware
of
the
circumstance
slept
for
five
days
without
interruption
and
it
need
not
therefore
be
a
matter
of
wonder
or
of
reproach
to
him
that
his
smooth
surfaces
had
become
covered
with
short
hair
reviling
himself
bitterly
for
the
appearance
which
he
conceived
he
must
have
exhibited
when
he
conducted
his
business
and
to
which
he
now
in
part
attributed
his
ling
went
forth
without
delay
and
quickly
discovering
one
of
those
who
remove
hair
publicly
for
a
very
small
sum
he
placed
himself
in
the
chair
and
directed
that
his
face
arms
and
legs
should
be
denuded
after
the
manner
affected
by
the
ones
who
make
a
practice
of
observing
the
most
recent
customs
the
illustrious
individual
who
is
now
conferring
distinction
on
this
really
chair
by
occupying
it
express
himself
in
favour
of
having
the
face
entirely
denuded
demanded
the
one
who
conducted
the
operation
for
these
persons
have
become
famous
for
their
elegant
and
persistent
ability
to
discourse
and
frequently
assume
ignorance
in
order
that
they
themselves
may
make
reply
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
knowledge
in
the
objectionable
opinion
of
this
unintelligent
person
who
has
a
presumptuous
habit
of
offering
his
very
undesirable
advice
a
slight
covering
on
the
upper
lip
delicately
arranged
and
somewhat
fiercely
pointed
at
the
extremities
would
bestow
an
appearance
of
how
shall
this
illiterate
person
explain
himself
dignity
matured
reflexion
doubtless
the
accomplished
nobleman
before
me
will
understand
what
is
intended
with
a
more
accuracy
than
this
person
can
describe
it
but
confer
that
highly
desirable
effect
upon
the
face
of
which
at
present
it
is
entirely
destitute
denuded
then
without
fail
it
shall
certainly
be
so
o
incomparable
personage
does
the
versatile
mandarin
now
present
profess
any
concern
as
to
the
condition
of
the
rice
plants
indeed
the
remark
is
an
inspired
one
the
subject
is
totally
devoid
of
interest
to
a
person
of
intelligence
a
remarkable
and
event
transpired
within
the
notice
of
this
unassuming
person
recently
a
discriminating
individual
had
purchased
from
him
a
portion
of
his
justly
renowned
essence
of
celestial
herb
oil
a
preparation
which
in
this
experienced
opinion
indeed
would
greatly
relieve
the
undoubted
afflictions
from
which
the
one
before
him
is
evidently
suffering
when
after
once
anointing
himself
a
lengthy
period
containing
no
words
caused
ling
who
had
in
the
meantime
closed
his
eyes
and
lost
canton
and
all
else
in
delicate
thoughts
of
mian
to
look
up
that
which
met
his
attention
on
doing
so
filled
him
with
an
intelligent
wonder
for
the
person
before
him
held
in
his
hand
what
had
the
appearance
of
a
tuft
of
bright
yellow
hair
which
shone
in
the
light
of
the
sun
with
a
most
engaging
splendour
but
which
he
nevertheless
regarded
with
a
most
undignified
expression
of
confusion
and
awe
demon
he
cried
at
length
very
respectfully
the
extreme
amiableness
to
be
of
a
benevolent
disposition
and
do
not
take
an
unworthy
and
entirely
unremunerative
revenge
upon
this
very
unimportant
person
for
failing
to
detect
and
honour
you
from
the
words
indicate
nothing
beyond
an
excess
of
hemp

for
many
hours

remained
in
his

examining
in
his

all
passages
either
in
his

in
the
lives
of
others
which
might
by
any
chance
have
influence
on
the
event
before
him
in
this
thorough
way
he
became
assured
that
the
competition
and
its
results
his
journey
to
with
the
encounter
in
the
cypress
wood
the
flight
of
the
incapable
and
treacherous
mandarin
and
the
battle
of

were
all
down
to
the
matter
of
the
smallest
detail
parts
of
a
symmetrical
and
complete
scheme
tending
to
his
present
condition
cheered
and
upheld
by
this
proof
of
the
fact
that
very
able
deities
were
at
work
on
his
behalf
he
turned
his
intellect
from
the
entrancing
subject
to
a
contemplation
of
the
manner
in
which
his
condition
would
enable
him
to
frustrate
the
uninventive
villainies
of
the
obstinate
person
li
keen
and
to
provide
a
suitable
house
and
mode
of
living
to
which
he
would
be
justified
in
introducing
mian
after
adequate
marriage
ceremonies
had
been
observed
between
them
in
this
endeavour
he
was
less
successful
than
he
had
imagined
would
be
the
case
for
when
he
had
first
fully
understood
that
his
body
was
of
such
a
substance
that
nothing
was
wanting
to
transmute
it
into
fine
gold
but
the
absence
of
the
living
spirit
he
had
naturally
and
without
deeply
examining
the
detail
assumed
that
so
much
gold
might
be
considered
to
be
in
his
possession
now
however
a
very
definite
thought
arose
within
him
that
his
own
wishes
and
interests
would
have
been
better
secured
had
the
benevolent
spirits
who
undertook
the
matter
placed
the
secret
within
his
knowledge
in
such
a
way
as
to
enable
him
to
administer
the
fluid
to
some
very
heavy
and
inexpensive
animal
so
that
the
issue
which
seemed
inevitable
before
the
enjoyment
of
the
riches
could
be
entered
upon
should
not
have
touched
his
own
comfort
so
closely
to
a
person
of
refined
imagination
it
could
not
fail
to
be
a
subject
of
internal
reproach
that
while
he
would
become
the
most
precious
dead
body
in
the
world
his
value
in
life
might
not
be
very
honourably
placed
even
by
the
most
complimentary
one
who
should
require
his
services
then
came
the
thought
which
however
degraded
he
found
himself
unable
to
put
quite
beyond
him
that
if
in
the
meantime
he
were
able
to
gain
a
sufficiency
for
mian
and
himself
even
her
pure
and
delicate
love
might
not
be
able
to
bear
so
offensive
a
test
as
that
of
seeing
him
grow
old
and
remain
intolerably
healthy
perhaps
with
advancing
years
actually
becoming
lighter
day
by
day
and
thereby
lessening
in
value
before
her
eyes
when
the
natural
infirmities
of
age
and
the
presence
of
an
posterity
would
make
even
a
moderate
amount
of
taels
of
inestimable
value
no
doubt
remained
in
mind
that
the
process
of
frequently
making
smooth
his
surfaces
would
yield
an
amount
of
gold
enough
to
suffice
for
his
own
needs
but
a
brief
consideration
of
the
matter
convinced
him
that
this
source
would
be
inadequate
to
maintain
an
entire
household
even
if
he
continually
denuded
himself
to
an
almost
ignominious
extent
as
he
fully
weighed
these
varying
chances
the
certainty
became
more
clear
to
him
with
every
thought
that
for
the
virtuous
enjoyment
of
society
one
great
sacrifice
was
required
of
him
this
act
it
seemed
to
be
intimated
would
without
delay
provide
for
an
affluent
and
lengthy
future
and
at
the
same
time
would
influence
all
the
spirits
even
those
who
had
been
hitherto
towards
him
in
such
a
manner
that
his
enemies
would
be
removed
from
his
path
by
a
process
which
would
expose
them
to
public
ridicule
and
he
would
be
assured
in
founding
an
illustrious
and
enduring
line
to
accomplish
this
successfully
necessitated
the
loss
of
at
least
the
greater
part
of
one
entire
member
and
for
some
time
the
disadvantages
of
going
through
an
existence
with
only
a
single
leg
or
arm
seemed
more
than
a
sufficient
price
to
pay
even
for
the
definite
advantages
which
would
be
made
over
to
him
in
return
this
unworthy
thought
however
could
not
long
withstand
the
memory
of
steadfast
and
affection
and
the
certainty
of
her
enlightened
gladness
at
his
return
even
in
the
imperfect
condition
which
he
anticipated
nor
was
there
absent
from
his
mind
a
hope
that
the
matter
did
not
finally
rest
with
him
but
that
everything
which
he
might
be
inspired
to
do
was
in
reality
only
a
portion
of
the
complete
and
arranged
system
into
which
he
had
been
drawn
and
in
which
his
part
had
been
assigned
to
him
from
the
beginning
without
power
for
him
to
deviate
no
matter
how
much
to
the
contrary
the
thing
should
appear
as
no
advantage
would
be
gained
by
making
any
delay
ling

sought
the
most
favourable
means
of
putting
his
resolution
into
practice
and
after
many
skilful
and
insidious
inquiries
he
learnt
of
an
accomplished
person
who
made
a
consistent
habit
of
cutting
off
limbs
which
had
become
troublesome
to
their
possessors
either
through
accident
or
disease
furthermore
he
was
said
to
be
of
a
sincere
and
charitable
disposition
and
many
persons
declared
that
on
no
occasion
had
he
been
known
to
make
use
of
the
helpless
condition
of
those
who
visited
him
in
order
to
extort
money
from
them
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
be
able
to
conceal
within
his
own
breast
the
true
reason
for
the
operation
ling
placed
himself
before
the
person
in
question
and
exhibited
the
matter
to
him
so
that
it
would
appear
as
though
his
desires
were
promoted
by
the
presence
of
a
small
but
persistent
sprite
which
had
taken
its
abode
within
his
left
thigh
and
there
resisted
every
effort
of
the
most
experienced
wise
persons
to
induce
it
to
come
forth
again
satisfied
with
this
explanation
of
the
necessity
of
the
deed
the
one
who
undertook
the
matter
proceeded
with
assistance
to
sharpen
his
cutting
instruments
and
to
heat
the
hardening
irons
but
no
sooner
had
he
made
a
shallow
mark
to
indicate
the
lines
which
his
knife
should
take
than
his
subtle
observation
at
once
showed
him
that
the
facts
had
been
represented
to
him
in
a
wrong
sense
and
that
his
visitor
indeed
was
composed
of
no
common
substance
being
of
a
gentle
and
forbearing
disposition
he
did
not
manifest
any
indication
of
rage
at
the
discovery
but
amiably
and
unassumingly
pointed
out
that
such
a
course
was
not
respectful
towards
himself
and
that
moreover
ling
might
incur
certain
and
highly
undesirable
maladies
as
a
punishment
for
the
deception
overcome
with
remorse
at
deceiving
so
courteous
and
a
person
ling
fully
explained
the
circumstances
to
him
not
even
concealing
from
him
certain
facts
which
related
to
the
actions
of
remote
ancestors
but
which
nevertheless
appeared
to
have
influenced
the
succession
of
events
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
the
narrative
the
other
said
now
it
is
truly
remarked
that
every
mandarin
has
three
hands
and
every
soldier
a
like
number
of
feet
yet
it
is
a
saying
which
is
rather
to
be
regarded
as
manifesting
the
deep
wisdom
and
discrimination
of
the
speaker
than
as
an
actual
fact
which
can
be
taken
advantage
of
when
one
is
so
minded
least
of
all
by
so
valiant
a
commander
as
the
one
before
me
who
has
clearly
proved
that
in
time
of
battle
he
has
exactly
reversed
the
loss
would
undoubtedly
be
of
considerable
inconvenience

admitted

none
the
less
the
sage
remark
of

in
the
embrace
of

voracious
and
powerful
wild
animal
the
desirability
of
leaving
a
limb
is
not
a
matter
to
be
subjected
to
lengthy
consideration
is
undoubtedly
a
valuable
guide
for
general
conduct
this
person
has
endured
many
misfortunes
and
suffered
many
injustices
he
has
known
the
of
great
hopes
which
have
withered
and
daily
grown
less
when
the
difficulties
of
maintaining
an
honourable
and
illustrious
career
have
unfolded
themselves
within
his
sight
before
him
still
lie
the
attractions
of
a
moderate
competency
to
be
shared
with
the
one
whose
absence
would
make
even
the
upper
region
unendurable
and
after
having
this
entrancing
future
once
shattered
by
the
cupidity
of
a
depraved
and
incapable
mandarin
he
is
determined
to
welcome
even
the
sacrifice
which
you
condemn
rather
than
let
the
opportunity
vanish

not
an
unworthy
or
abandoned
decision

aid

had
invoked

matter
in
which
this
person
would
refrain
from
taking
part
were
there
no
other
and
more
agreeable
means
by
which
the
same
results
may
be
attained
a
circumstance
has
occurred
within
this
superficial
mind
however
a
brother
of

by
profession
one
of
those
who
purchase
large
undertakings
for
which
they
have
not
the

to
pay

who
thereupon
by
various
expedients
gain
the
ear

the
thrifty
enticing
them
by
fair
offers
of
return
to
entrust
their
savings
for
the
purpose
of
paying
off
the
debt
these
persons
are
ever
on
the
watch
for
transactions
by
which
they
inevitably
prosper
without
incurring
any
obligation
and
doubtless
my
brother
will
be
able
to
gather
a
just
share
of
the
value
of
your
body
without
submitting
you
to
the
insufferable
annoyance
of
losing
a
great
part
of
it
without
clearly
understanding
how
so
inviting
an
arrangement
could
be
effected
the
manner
of
speaking
was
exceedingly
alluring
to
mind
perplexed
as
he
had
become
through
weighing
and
considering
the
various
attitudes
of
the
entire
matter
to
receive
a
certain
and
sufficient
sum
of
money
without
his
person
being
in
any
way
mutilated
would
be
a
satisfactory
but
as
far
as
he
had
been
able
to
observe
an
unapproachable
solution
to
the
difficulty
in
the
mind
of
the
amiable
person
with
whom
he
was
conversing
however
the
accomplishment
did
not
appear
to
be
surrounded
by
unnatural
obstacles
so
that
ling
was
content
to
leave
the
entire
design
in
his
hands
after
stating
that
he
would
again
present
himself
on
a
certain
occasion
when
it
was
asserted
that
the
brother
in
question
would
be
present
so
internally
lightened
did
ling
feel
after
this
inspiring
conversation
and
so
confident
of
a
speedy
success
had
the
obliging
words
made
him
become
that
for
the
first
time
since
his
return
to
canton
he
was
able
to
take
an
intellectual
interest
in
the
pleasures
of
the
city
becoming
aware
that
the
celebrated
play
entitled
precious
lamp
of
spotted
butterfly
was
in
process
of
being
shown
at
the
tea
garden
of
rainbow
lights
and
voices
he
purchased
an
entrance
and
after
passing
several
hours
in
this
conscientious
enjoyment
returned
to
his
chamber
and
passed
a
night
untroubled
by
any
manifestations
of
an
unpleasant
nature

applied
in

determination

confidently
stated
to
be
one
of
the
richest
persons
in

so
great
was
the
number
of
enterprises
in
which
he
had
possessions
that
he
himself
was
unable
to
keep
an
account
of
them
and
it
was
asserted
that
upon
occasions
he
had
run
through
the
streets
crying
aloud
that
such
an
undertaking
had
been
the
subject
of
most
inferior
and
uninviting
dreams
and
omens
a
custom
observed
by
those
who
wish
a
venture
ill
whereas
upon
returning
and
consulting
his
written
parchments
it
became
plain
to
him
that
he
had
indulged
in
a
very
objectionable
exhibition
as
he
himself
was
the
person
most
interested
in
the
success
of
the
matter
far
from
discouraging
him
however
such
incidents
tended
to
his
advantage
as
he
could
consistently
point
to
them
in
proof
of
his
unquestionable
commercial
honourableness

in
this
way
many
persons
of
all
classes
not
only
in
canton
or
in
the
province

all
over
the
empire
would
unhesitatingly
entrust
money
to
be
placed
in
undertakings
which
he
had
purchased
and
was
willing
to
describe
as
much
a
certain
class
of
printed
leaves

in
which
did
not
insert

mentions
of

forthcoming
ventures

verses
recording
his

examples
of
the

frequent
occasion
of
reminding
persons
that
owed
the
beginning
of
his
prosperity
to
finding
a
written
parchment
connected
with
a
mandarin
of
exalted
rank
and
a
low
caste

at

among

incomparably
nearer
than
that
on
which
the
imperial
army
would
receive
its
back

in
a
quaint
and
manner
advised
him
to
protect
himself
against
an
obscure

inevitable
poverty
by
learning
the
accomplishment
of
an
occupation

his
talents

that
without

into

content
to
describe
as

was
at
the
most
illustrious
point
of
his
existence
at
the
time
indeed
when
after
purchasing
without
money
the
renowned
and
proficient
for
a
million
taels
he
had
sold
it
again
for
ten
that
chang
was
informed
by
his
brother
of
the
circumstances
connected
with
ling
after
becoming
specially
assured
that
the
matter
was
indeed
such
as
it
was
represented
to
be
chang
at
once
discerned
that
the
venture
was
of
too
certain
and
profitable
a
nature
to
be
put
before
those
who
entrusted
their
money
to
him
in
ordinary
and
doubtful
cases
he
accordingly
called
together
certain
persons
whom
he
was
desirous
of
obliging
and
informing
them
privately
and
apart
from
business
terms
that
the
opportunity
was
one
of
exceptional
attractiveness
he
placed
the
facts
before
them
after
displaying
a
number
of
diagrams
bearing
upon
the
matter
he
proposed
that
they
should
form
an
enterprise
to
be
called
ling
after
death
without
much
risk
the
manner
of
conducting
this
undertaking
he
explained
to
be
as
follows
the
body
of
ling
whenever
the
spirit
left
it
should
become
as
theirs
to
be
used
for
profit
for
this
benefit
they
would
pay
ling
fifty
thousand
taels
when
the
understanding
was
definitely
arrived
at
five
thousand
taels
each
year
until
the
matter
ended
and
when
that
period
arrived
another
fifty
thousand
taels
to
persons
depending
upon
him
during
his
life
having
stated
the
figure
business
put
down
his
written
papers
and
causing
his
face
to
assume
the
look
of
irrepressible
but
dignified
satisfaction
which
it
was
his
custom
to
wear
on
most
occasions
and
especially
when
he
had
what
appeared
at
first
sight
to
be
evil
news
to
communicate
to
public
assemblages
of
those
who
had
entrusted
money
to
his
ventures
he
proceeded
to
disclose
the
advantages
of
such
a
system
at
the
extreme
he
said
the
amount
which
they
would
be
required
to
pay
would
be
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
taels
but
this
was
in
reality
a
very
misleading
view
of
the
circumstance
as
he
would
endeavour
to
show
them
for
one
detail
he
had
allotted
to
ling
thirty
years
of
existence
which
was
the
extreme
amount
according
to
the
calculations
of
those
skilled
in
such
prophecies
but
as
they
were
all
undoubtedly
aware
persons
of
very
expert
intellects
were
known
to
enjoy
a
much
shorter
period
of
life
than
the
gross
and
ordinary
and
as
ling
was
clearly
one
of
the
former
by
the
fact
of
his
contriving
so
ingenious
a
method
of
enriching
himself
they
might
with
reasonable
foresight
rely
upon
his
departing
when
half
the
period
had
been
attained
in
that
way
thousand
taels
would
be
restored
to
them
for
every
year
represented
a
saving
of
five
thousand
another
agreeable
contemplation
was
that
of
the
last
sum
for
by
such
a
time
they
would
have
arrived
at
the
most
pleasurable
part
of
the
enterprise
a
million
worth
of
pure
gold
would
be
displayed
before
them
and
the
question
of
the
final
fifty
thousand
could
be
disposed
of
by
cutting
off
an
arm
or
half
a
leg
whether
they
adopted
that
course
or
decided
to
increase
their
fortunes
by
exposing
so
exceptional
and
symmetrical
a
wonder
to
the
public
gaze
in
all
the
principal
cities
of
the
empire
was
a
circumstance
which
would
have
to
be
examined
within
their
minds
when
the
time
approached
in
such
a
way
the
detail
of
purchase
stood
revealed
as
only
fifty
thousand
taels
in
reality
a
sum
so
despicably
insignificant
that
he
had
internal
pains
at
mentioning
it
to
so
wealthy
a
group
of
mandarins
and
he
had
not
yet
made
clear
to
them
that
each
year
they
would
receive
gold
to
the
amount
of
almost
a
thousand
taels
this
would
be
the
result
of
ling
making
smooth
his
surfaces
and
it
would
enable
them
to
know
that
the
person
in
question
actually
existed
and
to
keep
the
circumstances
before
their
intellects
when
had
made
the
various
facts
clear
to
this
extent
those
who
were
assembled
expressed
their
feelings
as
favourably
turned
towards
the
project
provided
the
tests
to
which
ling
was
to
be
put
should
prove
encouraging
and
a
secure
and
intelligent
understanding
of
things
to
be
done
and
not
to
be
done
could
be
arrived
at
between
them
to
this
end
ling
was
brought
into
the
chamber
and
fixing
his
thoughts
steadfastly
upon
mian
he
permitted
portions
to
be
cut
from
various
parts
of
his
body
without
betraying
any
signs
of
ignoble
agitation
no
sooner
had
the
pieces
been
separated
and
the
virtue
of
existence
passed
from
them
than
they
changed
colour
and
hardened
nor
could
the
most
delicate
and
searching
trials
to
which
they
were
exposed
by
a
skilful
worker
in
metals
who
was
obtained
for
the
purpose
disclose
any
particular
however
minute
in
which
they
differed
from
the
finest
gold
the
hair
the
nails
and
the
teeth
were
similarly
affected
and
even
blood
dried
into
a
fine
gold
powder
this
detail
of
the
trial
being
successfully
completed
ling
subjected
himself
to
intricate
questioning
on
all
matters
connected
with
his
religion
and
manner
of
conducting
himself
both
in
public
and
privately
the
history
and
behaviour
of
his
ancestors
the
various
omens
and
remarkable
sayings
which
had
reference
to
his
life
and
destiny
and
the
intentions
which
he
then
possessed
regarding
his
future
movements
and
habits
of
living
all
the
wise
sayings
and
written
and
printed
leaves
which
made
any
allusion
to
the
existence
of
and
possibility
of
discovery
of
the
wonderful
gold
fluid
were
closely
examined
and
found
to
be
in
agreement
whereupon
those
present
made
no
further
delay
in
admitting
that
the
facts
were
indeed
as
they
had
been
described
and
indulged
in
a
dignified
stroking
of
each
faces
as
an
expression
of
pleasure
and
in
proof
of
their
satisfaction
at
taking
part
in
so
entrancing
and
remunerative
an
affair
at
command
many
rare
and
expensive
wines
were
then
brought
in
and
partaken
of
without
restraint
by
all
persons
the
repast
being
lightened
by
numerous
and
jests
having
reference
to
ling
and
the
unusual
composition
of
his
person
so
amiably
were
the
hours
occupied
that
it
was
past
the
time
of
no
light
when
chang
rose
and
read
at
full
length
the
statement
of
things
to
be
done
and
things
not
to
be
done
which
was
to
be
sealed
by
ling
for
his
part
and
the
other
persons
who
were
present
for
theirs
it
so
happened
however
that
at
that
period
mind
was
filled
with
brilliant
and
versatile
thoughts
and
images
of
mian
and
visions
of
the
manner
in
which
they
would
spend
the
entrancing
future
which
was
now
before
them
and
in
this
way
it
chanced
that
he
did
not
give
any
portion
of
his
intellect
to
the
reading
mistaking
it
indeed
for
a
delicate
and
very
set
of
verses
which
was
reciting
as
a
formal
blessing
on
parting
nor
was
it
until
he
was
desired
to
affix
his
sign
that
ling
discovered
his
mistake
and
being
of
too
respectful
and
unobtrusive
a
disposition
to
require
the
matter
to
be
repeated
then
he
carried
out
the
obligation
without
in
any
particular
understanding
the
written
words
to
which
he
was
agreeing
as
ling
walked
through
the
streets
to
his
chamber
after
leaving
the
house
and
company
of
holding
firmly
among
his
garments
the
thin
printed
papers
to
the
amount
of
fifty
thousand
taels
which
he
had
received
and
repeatedly
speaking
to
himself
in
terms
of
general
and
specific
encouragement
at
the
fortunate
events
of
the
past
few
days
he
became
aware
that
a
person
of
mean
and
rapacious
appearance
whom
he
had
some
memory
of
having
observed
within
the
residence
he
had
but
just
left
was
continually
by
his
side
not
at
first
doubting
that
the
circumstance
resulted
from
a
benevolent
desire
on
the
part
of
that
he
should
be
protected
on
his
passage
through
the
city
ling
affected
not
to
observe
the
incident
but
upon
reaching
his
own
door
the
person
in
question
persistently
endeavoured
to
pass
in
also
forming
a
fresh
judgment
about
the
matter
ling
who
was
very
powerfully
constructed
and
whose
natural
instincts
were
enhanced
in
every
degree
by
the
potent
fluid
of
which
he
had
lately
partaken
repeatedly
threw
him
across
the
street
until
he
became
weary
of
the
diversion
at
length
however
the
thought
arose
that
one
who
patiently
submitted
to
continually
striking
the
opposite
houses
with
his
head
must
have
something
of
importance
to
communicate
whereupon
he
courteously
invited
him
to
enter
the
apartment
and
unweigh
his
mind
facts
of
the
case
appear
to
have
been
somewhat
inadequately
represented
said
the
stranger
bowing
obsequiously
this
unornamental
person
was
assured
by
the
benignant
that
the
one
whose
shadow
he
was
to
become
was
of
a
mild
and
forbearing
words
are
as
the
conversation
of
birds
to
me
replied
ling
not
conjecturing
how
the
matter
had
fallen
about
person
has
just
left
the
presence
of
the
elegant
and
successful
and
no
word
that
he
spoke
gave
indication
of
such
a
follower
or
such
a
it
is
indeed
certain
that
the
various
transactions
have
not
been
fully
understood
exclaimed
the
other
the
exact
communication
to
this
unseemly
one
was
valuable
and
enlightened
ling
has
heard
and
agreed
to
the
different
things
to
be
done
and
not
to
be
done
one
phrase
of
which
arranges
for
your
continual
presence
so
that
he
will
anticipate
your
at
these
words
the
truth
became
as
daylight
before
eyes
and
he
perceived
that
the
written
paper
to
which
he
had
affixed
his
sign
contained
the
detail
of
such
an
office
as
that
of
the
person
before
him
when
too
late
more
than
ever
did
he
regret
that
he
had
not
formed
some
pretext
for
causing
the
document
to
be
read
a
second
time
as
in
view
of
his
immediate
intentions
such
an
arrangement
as
the
one
to
which
he
had
agreed
had
every
appearance
of
becoming
of
an
irksome
and
perplexing
nature
desiring
to
know
the
length
of
the
commands
ling
asked
him
for
a
clear
statement
of
his
duties
feigning
that
he
had
missed
that
portion
of
the
reading
through
a
momentary
attack
of
the
giddy
sickness
to
this
request
the
stranger
who
explained
that
his
name
was
wang
instantly
replied
that
his
written
and
spoken
orders
were
never
to
permit
more
than
an
length
of
space
to
separate
them
to
prevent
by
whatever
force
was
necessary
for
the
purpose
all
attempts
at
evading
the
things
to
be
done
and
not
to
be
done
and
to
ignore
as
of
no
interest
all
other
circumstances
it
seemed
to
ling
in
consequence
that
little
seclusion
would
be
enjoyed
unless
an
arrangement
could
be
effected
between
wang
and
himself
so
to
this
end
after
noticing
the
evident
poverty
and
covetousness
of
the
person
in
question
he
made
him
an
honourable
offer
of
frequent
rewards
provided
a
greater
distance
was
allowed
to
come
between
them
as
soon
as
was
reached
on
his
side
ling
undertook
not
to
break
through
the
wording
of
the
things
to
be
done
and
not
to
be
done
and
to
notify
to
wang
any
movements
upon
which
he
meditated
in
this
reputable
manner
the
obstacle
was
ingeniously
removed
and
the
intelligent
nature
of
the
device
was
clearly
proved
by
the
fact
that
not
only
ling
but
wang
also
had
in
the
future
a
much
greater
liberty
of
action
than
would
have
been
possible
if
it
had
been
necessary
to
observe
the
and
evidently
condition
which
had
endeavoured
to
impose
chapter
xiii
in
spite
of
his
natural
desire
to
return
to
mian
as
quickly
as
possible
ling
judged
it
expedient
to
give
several
days
to
the
occupation
of
purchasing
apparel
of
the
richest
kinds
weapons
and
armour
in
large
quantities
jewels
and
ornaments
of
worked
metals
and
other
objects
to
indicate
his
changed
position
nor
did
he
neglect
actions
of
a
pious
and
charitable
nature
for
almost
his
first
care
was
to
arrange
with
the
chief
ones
at
the
temple
of
benevolent
intentions
that
each
year
on
the
day
corresponding
to
that
on
which
he
drank
the
gold
fluid
a
sumptuous
and
coffin
should
be
presented
to
the
most
deserving
poor
and
aged
person
within
that
quarter
of
the
city
in
which
he
had
resided
when
these
preparations
were
completed
ling
set
out
with
an
extensive
train
of
attendants
but
riding
on
before
accompanied
only
by
wang
he
quickly
reached
without
adventure
the
meeting
between
ling
and
mian
was
affecting
to
such
an
extent
that
the
blind
and
deaf
attendants
wept
openly
without
reproach
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
neither
could
become
possessed
of
more
than
a
half
of
the
occurrence
eagerly
the
two
reunited
ones
examined
each
features
to
discover
whether
the
separation
had
brought
about
any
change
in
the
beloved
and
lines
ling
discovered
upon
mian
the
shadow
of
an
anxious
care
at
his
absence
while
the
disappointments
and
trials
which
ling
had
experienced
in
canton
had
left
traces
which
were
plainly
visible
to
penetrating
gaze
in
such
an
entrancing
occupation
the
time
was
to
them
without
hours
until
a
feeling
of
hunger
recalled
them
to
lesser
matters
when
a
variety
of
very
select
foods
and
liquids
was
placed
before
them
without
delay
after
this
elegant
repast
had
been
partaken
of
mian
supporting
herself
upon
shoulder
made
a
request
that
he
would
disclose
to
her
all
the
matters
which
had
come
under
his
observation
both
within
the
city
and
during
his
journey
to
and
from
that
place
upon
this
encouragement
ling
proceeded
to
unfold
his
mind
not
withholding
anything
which
appeared
to
be
of
interest
no
matter
how
slight
when
he
had
reached
canton
without
any
perilous
adventure
mian
breathed
more
freely
as
he
recorded
the
interview
at
the
office
of
warlike
deeds
and
arrangements
she
trembled
at
the
insidious
malignity
of
the
evil
person
li
keen
the
conversation
with
the
wise
reader
of
the
future
concerning
the
various
states
of
such
as

almost
threw
her
into
the
rigid
sickness
from
which
however
the
wonderful
circumstance
of
the
discovered
properties
of
the
gold
fluid
quickly
recalled
her
but
to
great
astonishment
no
sooner
had
he
made
plain
the
exceptional
advantages
which
he
had
derived
from
the
circumstances
and
the
nature
of
the
undertaking
at
which
he
had
arrived
with

became
a
prey
to
the
most
intolerable
and
unrestrained
anguish
my
devoted
but
excessively
lover
she
exclaimed
wildly
and
in
tones
which
clearly
indicated
that
she
was
inspired
by
every
variety
of
affectionate
emotion
the
unendurable
position
in
which
you
and
all
your
household
will
be
placed
by
the
degrading
commercial
schemes
and
instincts
of
the

no

almond
tea
in

to
have
an
opportunity
of
judging
the
value
of
the
appointments
of
the
house
pass
the
jesting
remark
that
while
the
lings
assuredly
have
dead
bones
in
the
secret
chamber
at
the
present
they
will
not
have
one
in
the
family
graveyard
by
reason
of
the
death
of
ling
himself
better
to
lose
a
thousand
limbs
during
life
than
the
entire
person
after
death
nor
would
your
adoring
mian
hesitate
to
clasp
proudly
to
her
organ
of
affection
the
veriest
trunk
that
had
parted
with
all
its
attributes
in
a
noble
and
sacrificing
endeavour
to
preserve
at
least
some
dignified
proportions
to
embellish
the
ancestral
temple
and
to
receive
the
worship
of
replied
ling
with
extravagant
humiliation
is
indeed
true
and
this
person
is
degraded
beyond
the
common
lot
of
those
who
break
images
and
commit
thefts
from
sacred
places
the
side
of
the
transaction
which

attention

this
superficial
individual

incomparable

no
degree
able
to
restrain
the
fountains
of
bitter
water
which
clouded
her
delicate
and
expressive
eyes

biting
and
ungracious
words

makes
a
formal
petition
doubt
the
deathless
strength
of
her
affection
cheerfully
in

to
avert

even
to
save
her

the
anguish
of
unavailing
and
remorse

she
consign
herself
to

or
expose
her
body
to
various
undignified
tortures

and
chamber

unsupportable

appear
to

the

while
they
were
still
conversing
together
and
endeavouring
to
divert
their
minds
from
the
objectionable
facts
which
had
recently
come
within
their
notice
an
attendant
entered
and
disclosed
that
the
train
of
servants
and
merchandise
which
ling
had
preceded
on
the
journey
was
arriving
at
this
fresh
example
of
her
consistent
thought
for
her
mian
almost
forgot
her
recent
agitation
and
eagerly
lending
herself
to
the
entrancing
occupation
of
unfolding
and
displaying
the
various
objects
her
brow
finally
lost
the
last
trace
of
sadness
greatly
beyond
the
imaginings
of
anticipation
were
the
expensive
articles
with
which

proudly
surrounded
her
and

examining
and
learning
the
cost
of
the
set

ornamental
garments
for
both

appointments
for

even
incenses

and
rare
viands
had
not
been

the

quickly
and
profitably
spent
when
the
hour
of
sunset
arrived
ling
having
learned
that
certain
preparations
which
he
had
commanded
were
fully
carried
out
took
mian
by
the
hand
and
led
her
into
the
chief
apartment
of
the
house
where
were
assembled
all
the
followers
and
attendants

down
to
the

and
superfluous

the

of
the

a
table
of
the
finest
ebony
stood
a
vessel
of
burning
incense

dishes
of
the
most
fruit
and
an
abundance
of
old
and
very
sweet
wine
before
these
emblems
ling
and
mian
placed
themselves
in
an
attitude
of
deep
humiliation
and
formally
expressed
their
gratitude
to
the
chief
deity
for
having
called
them
into
existence
to
the
cultivated
earth
for
supplying
them
with
the
means
of
sustaining
life
to
the
emperor
for
providing
the
numerous
safeguards
by
which
their
persons
were
protected
at
all
times
and
to
their
parents
for
educating
them
this
adequate
ceremony
being
completed
ling
explicitly
desired
all
those
present
to
observe
the
fact
that
the
two
persons
in
question
were
by
that
fact
and
from
that
time
made
as
one
being
and
the
bond
between
them
incapable
of
severance
when
the
ruling
came
out
from
among
the
clouds
ling
and
mian
became
possessed
of
a
great
desire
to
go
forth
with
pressed
hands
and
look
again
on
the
forest
paths
and
glades
in
which
they
had
spent
many
hours
of
exceptional
happiness
before
journey
to
canton
leaving
the
attendants
to
continue
the
feasting
and
in
a
completely
unrestrained
manner
they
therefore
passed
out
unperceived
and
wandering
among
the
trees
presently
stood
on
the
banks
of
the
my
beloved

gazing
at
the
brilliant
and
unruffled
water

this
person
esteem
a
short
river

such
as
we
often
enjoyed
together
in
the
days
when
you
were

to
whom
the
expressed
desires
of

were
as
the
word
of
the
emperor
instantly
prepared
the
small
and
ornamental
junk
which
was
fastened
near
for
this
purpose
and
was
about
to
step
in
when
a
presumptuous
and
highly
objectionable
hand
restrained
him
remarked
a
voice
which
ling
had
some
difficulty
in
ascribing
to
any
known
person
so
greatly
had
it
changed
from
its
usual
tone
how
the
immature
and
altogether
ling

his
spoken
and
written
assertions
at
this
speech
ling
drew
his
sword
without
further
thought
in
spite
of
the
restraining
arms
of
mian
but
at
the
sight
of
the
utterly
incapable
person
wang
who
stood
near
smiling
meaninglessly
and
waving
his
arms
with
a
continuous
and
backward
motion
he
again
replaced

can
be
left
to
fall
unheeded
from
the
lips
of
one
who
bears
every
indication
of
being
steeped
in
rice
spirit
he
said
with
unprovoked
dignity
will
be
the
plain
duty
of
this
expert
and
uncorruptible
person
to
furnish
the
unnecessary
but
nevertheless
very
severe
and
with
a
written
account
of
how
the
traitorous
and
deceptive
ling
has
endeavoured
to
break
through
the
vessel
of
the
liquids
to
be
consumed
and
not
to
be
consumed
continued
wang
with
increased
deliberation
and
an
entire
absence
of
attention
to
action
and
speech
how
by
this
refined
unfailing
civility
and
resourceful
strategy
he
has
been
said
ling
after
examining
his
thoughts
for
a
short
space
and
reflecting
that
the
list
of
things
to
be
done
and
not
to
be
done
was
to
him
as
a
blank
leaf
may
even
be
some
small
portion
of
that
which
is
accurate
in
his
statement
in
what
manner
he
continued
addressing
the
really
unendurable
person
who
was
by
this
time
preparing
to
pass
the
night
in
the
cool
swamp
by
the
edge
this
one
endanger
any
detail
of
the
written
and
sealed
parchment
by
such
an
action
replied
wang
pausing
in
the
process
of
removing
his
outer
garments
the
the
intricate
name
given
to
it
escapes
this
tongue
at
the
moment
but
the
experlingknowswhamean
provides
that
any
person
with
or
without
attempting
or
not
avoiding
to
travel
by
sea
lake
or
river
or
to
place
himself
in
such
a
position
as
he
may
reasonably
and
intelligently
be
drowned
in
salt
water
fresh
water
or
or
honourable
rice

shall
be
guilty
of
and
suffer
complete
loss
of
with
these
words
the
immoderate
and
contemptible
person
sank
down
in
a
very
profound
slumber
said
ling
turning
to
mian
who
stood
near
unable
to
retire
even
had
she
desired
by
reason
of
the
extreme
agitation
into
which
the
incident
had
thrown
her
delicate
mind
and
body
intensely
aggravating
a
circumstance
that
we
are
compelled
to
entertain
so
dissolute
a
one
by
reason
of
this
preoccupation
when
the
matter
was
read
nevertheless
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
detail
he
spoke
of
was
such
as
he
insisted
to
the
extent
of
making
it
a
thing
not
to
be
done
to
journey
in
any
manner
by
water
it
shall
be
an
early
endeavour
of
this
person
to
get
these
restraining
details
equitably
amended
but
in
the
meantime
we
will
retrace
our
footsteps
through
the
wood
and
the
enraptured
ling
will
make
a
attempt
to
lighten
the
passage
by
a
recital
of
his
verses
on
the
subject
of
from
the
loved
one
or
farewell
and
chapter
xiv
beloved
lord
said
mian
sadly
on
a
morning
after
many
days
had
passed
since
the
return
of
ling
you
not
every
possession
for
which
the
heart
of
a
wise
person
searches
yet
the
dark
mark
is
scarcely
ever
absent
from
your
symmetrical
brow
if
she
who
stands
before
you
and
is
henceforth
an
integral
part
of
your
organization
has
failed
you
in
any
particular
no
matter
how
unimportant
explain
the
matter
to
her
and
the
amendment
will
be
a
speedy
and
a
joyful
it
was
indeed
true
that
mind
was
troubled
but
the
fault
did
not
lie
with
mian
as
the
person
in
question
was
fully
aware
for
before
her
eyes
as
before
those
of
ling
the
unevadable
compact
which
had
been
entered
into
with
was
ever
present
insidiously
planting
bitterness
within
even
the
most
select
and
accomplished
delights
nor
with
increasing
time
did
the
obstinate
and
intrusive
person
wang
become
more
dignified
in
his
behaviour
on
the
contrary
he
freely
made
use
of
his
position
to
indulge
in
every
variety
of
abandonment
and
almost
each
day
he
prevented
by
reason
of
his
knowledge
of
the
things
to
be
done
and
not
to
be
done
some
refined
and
permissible
entertainment
upon
which
ling
and
mian
had
determined
ling
had
despatched
many
communications
upon
this
subject
to
praying
also
that
some
expert
way
out
of
the
annoyance
of
the
lesser
and
more
unimportant
things
not
to
be
done
should
be
arrived
at
but
the
time
when
he
might
reasonably
expect
an
answer
to
these
written
papers
had
not
yet
arrived
it
was
about
this
period
that
intelligence
was
brought
to
ling
from
the
villages
on
the
road
to
peking
how
li
keen
having
secretly
ascertained
that
his
yamen
was
standing
and
his
goods
uninjured
had
determined
to
return
and
was
indeed
at
that
hour
within
a
hundred
li
of
furthermore
he
had
repeatedly
been
understood
to
pronounce
clearly
that
he
considered
ling
to
be
the
head
and
beginning
of
all
his
inconveniences
and
to
declare
that
the
first
act
of
justice
which
he
should
accomplish
on
his
return
would
be
to
submit
the
person
in
question
to
the
most
unbearable
tortures
and
then
cause
him
to
lose
his
head
publicly
as
an
outrager
of
the
settled
state
of
things
and
an
enemy
of
those
who
loved
tranquillity
not
doubting
that
li
keen
would
endeavour
to
gain
an
advantage
by
treachery
if
the
chance
presented
itself
ling
determined
to
go
forth
to
meet
him
and
without
delay
settle
the
entire
disturbance
in
one
and
encounter
to
this
end
rather
than
disturb
the
placid
mind
of
mian
to
whom
the
thought
of
the
engagement
would
be
weighted
with
many
disquieting
fears
he
gave
out
that
he
was
going
upon
an
expedition
to
surprise
and
capture
certain
fish
of
a
very
delicate
flavour
and
attended
by
only
two
persons
he
set
forth
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
some
hours
later
owing
to
an
remark
on
the
part
of
the
deaf
attendant
to
whom
the
matter
had
been
explained
in
an
imperfect
light
mian
became
possessed
of
the
true
facts
of
the
case
and
immediately
all
the
pleasure
of
existence
went
from
her
she
despaired
of
ever
again
beholding
ling
in
an
ordinary
state
and
mournfully
reproached
herself
for
the
bitter
words
which
had
risen
to
her
lips
when
the
circumstance
of
his
condition
and
the
arrangement
with
first
became
known
to
her
after
spending
an
interval
in
a
polished
lament
at
the
manner
in
which
things
were
inevitably
tending
the
thought
occurred
to
mian
whether
by
any
means
in
her
power
she
could
influence
the
course
and
settled
method
of
affairs
in
this
situation
the
memory
of
the
person
wang
and
the
fact
that
on
several
occasions
he
had
made
himself
objectionable
when
ling
had
proposed
to
place
himself
in
such
a
position
that
he
incurred
some
very
remote
chance
of
death
by
drowning
or
by
fire
recurred
to
her
subduing
the
natural
and
repulsion
which
she
invariably
experienced
at
the
mere
thought
of
so
debased
an
individual
she
sought
for
him
and
discovering
him
in
the
act
of
constructing
cardboard
figures
of
men
and
animals
which
it
was
his
custom
to
dispose
skilfully
in
paths
for
the
purpose
of
enjoying
the
sudden
terror
of
those
who
passed
by
she
quickly
put
the
matter
before
him
urging
him
by
some
means
to
prevent
the
encounter
which
must
assuredly
cost
the
life
of
the
one
whom
he
had
so
often
previously
obstructed
from
incurring
the
slightest
risk
no
means
exclaimed
wang
when
he
at
length
understood
the
full
meaning
of
the
project
would
be
a
most
unpresentable
action
for
this
commonplace
person
to
interfere
in
so
honourable
an
undertaking
had
the
priceless
body
of
the
intrepid
ling
been
in
any
danger
of
disappearing
as
for
example
by
drowning
or
being
consumed
in
fire
the
nature
of
the
circumstance
would
have
been
different
as
the
matter
exists
however
there
is
every
appearance
that
the
will
soon
reap
the
deserved
reward
of
his
somewhat
speculative
enterprise
and
to
that
end
this
person
will
immediately
procure
a
wooden
barrier
and
the
services
of
four
robust
carriers
and
proceed
to
the
scene
of
the
deprived
of
even
this
hope
of
preventing
the
encounter
mian
betook
herself
in
extreme
dejection
to
the
secret
room
of
the
magician
which
had
been
unopened
since
the
day
when
the
two
attendants
had
searched
for
substances
to
apply
to
their
master
and
there
she
diligently
examined
every
object
in
the
remote
chance
of
discovering
something
which
might
prove
of
value
in
averting
the
matter
in
question
not
anticipating
that
the
true
reason
of
his
journey
would
become
known
to
mian
ling
continued
on
his
way
without
haste
and
passing
through
before
the
sun
had
risen
entered
upon
the
great
road
to
peking
at
a
convenient
distance
from
the
town
he
came
to
a
favourable
piece
of
ground
where
he
decided
to
await
the
arrival
of
li
keen
spending
the
time
profitably
in
polishing
his
already
brilliant
sword
and
making
observations
upon
the
nature
of
the
spot
and
the
condition
of
the
surrounding
omens
on
which
the
success
of
his
expedition
would
largely
depend
as
the
sun
reached
the
highest
point
in
the
open
sky
the
sound
of
an
approaching
company
could
be
plainly
heard
but
at
the
moment
when
the
chair
of
the
mandarin
appeared
within
the
sight
of
those
who
waited
the
great
luminary
upon
which
all
portents
depend
directly
or
indirectly
changed
to
the
colour
of
blood
and
began
to
sink
towards
the
earth
without
any
misgivings
therefore
ling
disposed
his
two
attendants
in
the
wood
with
instructions
to
step
forth
and
aid
him
if
he
should
be
attacked
by
overwhelming
numbers
while
he
himself
remained
in

certainly
bear
him
themselves
to

there
gain
the
approbation

extortionate

thoughts

opportunely

dispel
the
embarrassing
perplexities
of
existence
which
were
settling
thickly
about
him
urged
forward
by
a
variety
of
circumstances
which
placed
him
in
an
entirely
different
spirit
from
the
honourable
bearing
which
he
had
formerly
maintained

now
closely
examined
all
the

might
not
be
able
to
effect
his
purpose

an
outward
exhibition

in
this
degrading
occupation
a
detail
came
to
his
notice
which
caused
him
to
become
very
amiably
disposed
and
confident
of
success
proceeding
with
the
matter
he
caused
a
report
to
be
spread
about
that
ling
was
suffering
from
a
wasting
sickness
which
without
in
any
measure
shortening
his
life
would
cause
him
to
return
to
the
size
and
weight
of
a

being
by
these
means
enabled
to
secure
the
entire
matter
of

after
death
without
much
risk
at
a
very
small
outlay

did
so

to

seated
together
at

armed

direct
opposition

the
general

the

his
renowned

honourably
adopted

by

be
brought
in
the

before
the
court
of
final
settlement
at
peking
where
it
may
indeed
be
judged
in
the
manner
you
assert
but
as
such
a
process
must
infallibly
consume
the
wealth
of
a
province
and
the
years
of
an
ordinary
lifetime
and
as
it
is
this
unmoved
intention
to
carry
out
his
own
view
of
the
undertaking
without

such
speculations
are
not

this
chang

certain
instructions
to
his
followers

thereupon
prepared
to
advance
perceiving
that
the
last
detail
of
the
affair
had
been
arrived
at

threw
back
his
hanging
garment
and
was
on
the
point
of
rushing
forward
to
meet
them
when
mian
who
had
maintained
a
possessed
and
reliant
attitude
throughout
pushed
towards
him
the
vessel
of
pure
and
sparkling
liquid
with
which
they
had
been
engaged
when
so
presumptuously
broken
in
upon
at
the
same
time
speaking
to
him
certain
words
in
an
outside
language
a
new
and
confidence
immediately
took
possession
of

striking
his
sword
against
the
wall
with
such
irresistible
force
that
the
entire
chamber
trembled
and
the
assassins
shrank
back
in
unrestrained
terror
he
leapt
upon
the
table
grasping
in
one
hand
the
open
vessel
the
end
o
most
uninventive
and
he
cried
in
a
dreadful
and
voice
a
reward
for
your
faithless
and
traitorous
behaviour
learn
how
such
incompetence
turns
and
fastens
itself
upon
the
vitals
of
those
who
beget
it
in
spite
of
many
things
which
were
not
of
a
graceful
nature
towards
him
this
person
has
unassumingly
maintained
his
part
of
the
undertaking
and
would
have
followed
such
a
course
conscientiously
to
the
last
as
it
is
when
he
has
made
an
end
of
speaking
the
body
which
you
are
already
covetously
estimating
in
taels
will
in
no
way
be
distinguishable
from
that
of
the
meanest
and
most
ordinary
maker
of
commercial
ventures
in
canton
for
behold
the
fluid
which
he
holds
in
his
hand
and
which
it
is
his
fixed
intention
to
drain
to
the
last
drop
is
in
truth
nothing
but
a
secret
and
exceedingly
powerful
counteractor
against
the
virtues
of
the
gold
drug
and
though
but
a
single
particle
passed
his
lips
and
the
swords
of
your
brilliant
and
versatile
murderers
met
the
next
moment
in
his
breast
the
body
which
fell
at
your
feet
would
be
meet
for
worms
rather
than
for
the
it
was
indeed
such
a
substance
as
ling
represented
it
to
be
mian
having
discovered
it
during
her
very
systematic
examination
of
the
dead
inner
room
its
composition
and
distillation
had
involved
that
person
in
many
years
of
arduous
toil
for
with
a
somewhat
unintelligent
lack
of
foresight
he
had
obstinately
determined
to
perfect
the
antidote
before
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
drug
itself
had
the
matter
been
more
ingeniously
arranged
he
would
undoubtedly
have
enjoyed
an
earlier
triumph
and
an
affluent
and
respected
old
age
at
earnest
words
and
prepared
attitude
an
instant
conviction
of
the
truth
of
his
assertions
took
possession
of

therefore
seeing
nothing
but
immediate
and
unevadable
ruin
at
the
next
step
he
called
out
in
a
loud
and
imploring
voice
that
he
should
desist
and
no
harm
would
come
upon
him
to
this
ling
consented
first
insisting
that
the
followers
should
be
dismissed
without
delay
and
chang
alone
remain
to
have
conversation
on
the
matter
by
this
just
act
the
lower
parts
of

greatly
purified
for
the
persons

driven
forth
into
the
woods

perished
by
encounters
with
wild
animals
or
at
the
hands
of
the
enraged
villagers

by

time
become
greatly
endeared

usual
state

been
restored

made
clear
to

the
altered
nature
of
the
conditions
to
which
he
would
alone
agree

a
and
magnanimous
proposal
on
your
part
and
one
to
which
this
misguided
person
had
no
claim
admitted

as
he
affixed
his
seal
to
the
written
undertaking
and
committed
the
former
parchment
to
be
consumed

arrangement
it
was
agreed

valuable

to

arrived

remaining
to
embellish
the

from

her
flowing
garment
an
instrument
of
stringed
wood
and
touching
it
with
a
quick
but
delicate
stroke
like
the
flight
and
pausing
of
a
butterfly
told
in
words
a
refined
narrative
of
two
illustrious
and
persons

how
after

disagreeable
evils

unendurable
separations
they
entered
upon
a
destined
state

celestial
favour

the
head
by
one
stroke
of
the
paddle
and
prepared
by
using
similar
means
to
return
to
the
place
of
mooring
he
remarked
ceasing
for
a
moment
to
continue
this
skilful
occupation
words
which
you
have
just
spoken
might
without
injustice
be
applied
to
the
two
persons
who
are
now
conversing
together
for
after
suffering
misfortunes
and
wrongs
beyond
an
appropriate
portion
they
have
now
reached
that
period
of
existence
when
a
tranquil
and
contemplative
future
is
assured
to
them
in
this
manner
is
the
sage
and
matured
utterance
of
the
inspired
philosopher
again
proved
that
the
life
of
every
person
is
largely
composed
of
two
varieties
of
circumstances
which
together
build
up
his
existence
the
good
and
the
the
end
of
the
story
of

chapter
xvi
when
kai
lung
the
made
an
end
of
speaking
he
was
immediately
greeted
with
a
variety
of
delicate
and
pleasing
remarks
all
persons
who
had
witnessed
the
matter
down
even
to
the
lowest
type
of
miaotze
who
by
reason
of
their
obscure
circumstances
had
been
unable
to
understand
the
meaning
of
a
word
that
had
been
spoken
maintaining
that
kai
accomplishment
of
continuing
for
upwards
of
three
hours
without
a
pause
had
afforded
an
entertainment
of
a
very
high
and
refined
order
while
these
polished
sayings
were
being
composed
together
with
many
others
of
a
similar
nature
lin

suddenly
leapt
to
his
feet
with
a
variety
of
highly
objectionable
remarks
concerning
the
ancestors
of
all
those
who
were
present
and
declaring
that
the
story
of
ling
was
merely
a
stratagem
to
cause
them
to
forget
the
expedition
which
they
had
determined
upon
for
by
that
time
it
should
have
been
completely
carried
out
it
was
undoubtedly
a
fact
that
the
hour
spoken
of
for
the
undertaking
had
long
passed
lin
yi
having
completely
overlooked
the
speed
of
time
in
his
benevolent
anxiety
that
the
polite
and
valorous
ling
should
in
the
end
attain
to
a
high
and
remunerative
destiny
in
spite
of
kai
consistent
denials
of
any
treachery
he
could
not
but
be
aware
that
the
incident
tended
greatly
to
his
disadvantage
in
the
eyes
of
those
whom
he
had
fixed
a
desire
to
conciliate
nor
did
his
offer
that
he
would
without
hesitation
repeat
the
display
for
a
like
number
of
hours
effect
his
amiable
purpose
how
the
complication
would
finally
have
been
determined
without
interruption
is
a
matter
merely
of
imagination
for
at
that
moment
an
outpost
who
had
been
engaged
in
guarding
the
secrecy
of
the
expedition
threw
himself
into
the
enclosure
in
a
torn
and
breathless
condition
having
run
through
the
forest
many
li
in
a
winding
direction
for
the
explicit
purpose
of
warning
lin
yi
that
his

lived
at

near

and
avaricious
maker
of

so
skilful
had
he
become
in
the
making
of

idols
that
his
fame
had
spread
for
many

and
from
all
the
neighbouring
villages
and
even
from
the
towns
came
to
him
for
their
stock
no

between
honan
and
nanking
employed
so
many
or
so
many
modellers
yet
with
all
his
riches
his
avarice
increased
till
at
length
he
employed
men
whom
he
called
and
who
went
from
house
to
house
selling
his
idols
and
extolling
his
virtues
in
verses
composed
by
the
most
illustrious
poets
of
the
day
he
did
this
in
order
that
he
might
turn
into
his
own
pocket
the
full
price
of
the
idols
grudging
those
who
would
otherwise
have
sold
them
the
few
cash
which
they
would
make
owing
to
this
he
had
many
enemies
and
his
army
of
travellers
made
him
still
more
for
they
were
more
rapacious
than
the
scorpion
and
more
obstinate
than
the
ox

there
is
still

is
possible
to
soften
the
heart
of

a

from

is
taken
as
a
mark
of
welcome
by
an
agent
of

so
that
people
barred
the
doors
at
their
approach
and
even
hung
out
signs
of
death
and
mourning
among
all
his
travellers
there
was
none
more
successful
more
abandoned
and
more
valuable
to

than

so
depraved
was
li

that
he
was
never
known
to
visit
the
tombs
of
his

indeed
it
was
said
that
he
had
been
heard
to
mock
their
venerable
memories
and
that
he
had
jestingly
offered
to
sell
them
to
anyone
who
should
chance

call

of

most
illustrious

would
command
the

to
carry
to
their
masters

tablets
on

were
inscribed

name
and
his
virtues

salute
them

greeting
of

and
then
proceed
to
exhibit
samples
of
his
wares
greatly
overrating
their

he
would
exclaim
not
this
idol
worthy
of
the
place
of
honour
in
this
sumptuous
mansion
which
my
presence
defiles
to
such
an
extent
that
twelve
basins
of

not
remove
the

are
not
its
eyes
more
delicate
than
the
most
select
of
almonds
and
is
not
its
stomach
rounder
than
the
cupolas
upon
the
high
temple
at
peking
yet
in
spite
of
its
perfections
it
is
not
worthy
of
the
acceptance
of
so
distinguished
a
mandarin
and
therefore
i
will
accept
in
return
the
which
indeed
is
less

gives
for

without

accordingly
as

grew
in

obtained
his
consent
to

sent
to

two
bracelets
of

a
scarlet

as
a
betrothal

and
ning
although
compelled
by
the
second
of
the
five
great
principles
to
respect
her
father
was
unable
to
regard
the
marriage
with
anything
but
abhorrence
perhaps
this
was
not
altogether
the
fault
of

for
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
she
had
received
his

walked
in
the
rice
fields
and
sitting
down
at
the
foot
of
a
funereal
cypress
whose
highest
branches
pierced
the
middle
air
she
cried
aloud
can
not
control
my
bitterness
of
what
use
is
it
that
i
should
be
called
the
pigeon
among
golden
lilies
if

for

that

ambitious

agricultural
or

a

beside

stepped
from
behind
the
cypress
tree
where
he
had
been
waiting
for

one
more
symmetrical

continued

violent

would
have
come

most
unseemly

most
conspicuous

notifications
of

character
similar
to

to

exceedingly
elegantly
written
and
composed

the
exceedingly
ungraceful
walk
and
bearing
of
the
low
person
who
calls

truthfully
it
is
that
of
a
dog
in
the
act
of
being
dragged
to
the
river
because
his
sores
and
diseases
render
him
objectionable
in

this
hunchbacked

be
dragged
to

be
bowstrung
to

of

be

weapon
said

admiringly
when
her

had
finished

is
starting
on
a
journey
nor

he
return
till
the
first
day
of
the

go
to

the
fate
will
overtake

taking
up

paused
i

of
a
literary
career
learn
then
the
value
of
knowledge
by
its
aid
assisted
indeed
by
the
spirits
of
my
ancestors
i
have
discovered
a
new
and
strange
thing
for
which
i
can
find
no
word
by
using
this
new
system
of
reckoning
your
illustrious
but
exceedingly
and
miserly
father
would
be
able
to
make
five
taels
where
he
now
makes
one
would
he
not
in
consideration
for
this
consent
to
receive
me
as
a
and
dismiss
the
inelegant
and
unworthy

the
unlikely
event
of
your
being
able
to
convince
my
illustrious
parent
of
what
you
say
it
would
assuredly
be
so
replied
ning
in
what
way
could
you
do
so
my
sublime
and
charitable
father
already
employs
all
the
means
in
his
power
to
reap
the
full
reward
of
his
sacred
industry
his
are
in
reality
mere
shells
of
clay
images
are
correspondingly
constructed
and
his
clay
gatherers
and
modellers
are
all
paid
on
a
nay
further
it
is
beyond
likelihood
that
he
should
wish
for
more
purchasers
for
so
great
is
his
fame
that
those
who
come
to
buy
have
sometimes
to
wait
for
days
in
consequence
of
those
before
them
for
my
exceedingly
methodical
sire
entrusts
none
with
the
receiving
of
money
and
the
exchanges
are
therefore
made
slowly
frequently
an
unnaturally
devout
person
will
require
as
many
as
a
hundred
idols
and
so
the
greater
part
of
the
day
will
be
what
way
inquired
yung
tremulously
in
order
that
the
countings
may
not
get
mixed
of
course
it
is
necessary
that
when
he
has
paid
for
one
idol
he
should
carry
it
to
a
place
aside
and
then
return
and
pay
for
the
second
carrying
it
to
the
first
and
in
such
a
manner
to
the
end
in
this
way
the
sun
sinks
behind
the
said
yung
his
voice
thick
with
his
great
discovery
he
could
pay
for
the
entire
quantity
at
once
then
it
would
take
but
a
hundredth
part
of
the
time
and
so
more
idols
could
be
could
this
be
done
inquired
ning
wonderingly
it
is
impossible
to
conjecture
the
value
of
so
many
the
unlearned
it
would
indeed
be
impossible
replied
yung
proudly
by
the
aid
of
my
literary
researches
i
have
been
enabled
to
discover
a
process
by
which
such
results
would
be
not
a
matter
of
conjecture
but
of
certainty
these
figures
i
have
committed
to
tablets
which
i
am
prepared
to
give
to
your
mercenary
and
father
in
return
for
your
incomparable
hand
a
share
of
the
profits
and
the
dismissal
of
the
uninventive
and
morally
threadbare
li
the
boasts
of
his
elegant
wings

eagle
can
afford
to
be
silent
said
a
harsh
voice
behind
them
and
turning
hastily
they
beheld

who
had
come
upon
them
unawares
most
insignificant
of

continued
is
very
evident
that
much
has
softened
your
usually
brains

it
not
that
you
are
obviously
mentally
afflicted
i
should
unhesitatingly
persuade
my
beautiful
and
refined
sword
to
introduce
you
to
the
spirits
of
your
ignoble
ancestors
as
it
is
i
will
merely
cut
off
your
nose
and
your
left
ear
so
that
people
may
not
say
that
the
dragon
of
the
earth
sleeps
and
wickedness
goes
had
already
drawn
their
swords
and
very
soon
the
blows
were
so
hard
and
swift
that
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
it
seemed
as
though
the
air
were
filled
with
innumerable
and
fireworks
each
was
a
practised
swordsman
and
there
was
no
advantage
gained
on

when

who
had
fled
on
the
appearance
of

reappeared
urging
on
her
father
whose
usually
leisurely
footsteps
were
quickened
by
the
dread
that
the
duel
must
surely
result
in
certain
loss
to
himself
either
of
a
valuable
servant
or
of
the
discovery
which
ning
had
briefly
explained
to
him
and
of
which
he
at
once
saw
the
value

distinguished

he
exclaimed
breathlessly
as
soon
as
he
was
within
hearing
distance
not
trouble
to
give
so
marvellous
an
exhibition
for
the
benefit
of
this
unworthy
individual
who
is
the
only
observer
of
your
illustrious
dexterity
indeed
your
honourable
condescension
so
fills
this
illiterate
person
with
shame
that
his
hearing
is
thereby
preternaturally
sharpened
and
he
can
plainly
distinguish
many
voices
from

crying
for

it
is
all
that
you
say
let
us
discuss
the
matter
without
ceremony
can
you
prove
to
me
that
your
system
possesses
the
merit
you
claim
for
it
if
so
then
the
matter
of
arrangement
will
be
am
convinced
of
the
absolute
certainty
and
accuracy
of
the
discovery
replied
yung
chang
is
not
as
though
it
were
an
ordinary
matter
of
human
intelligence
for
this
was
discovered
to
me
as
i
was
worshipping
at
the
tomb
of
my
ancestors
the
method
is
regulated
by
a
system
of
squares
triangles
and
cubes
but
as
the
practical
proof
might
be
long
and
as
i
hesitate
to
keep
your
adorable

out
in
the
damp
night
air
may
i
not
call
at
your
inimitable
dwelling
in
the

when
we
can
go
into

thoroughly
will
not
weary
this
intelligent
gathering
each
member
of
which
doubtless
knows
all
the
books
on
mathematics
off
by
heart
with
a
recital
of
the
means
by
which
yung
chang
proved
to
ti
hung
the
accuracy
of
his
tables
and
the
value
of
his
discovery
of
the
multiplication
table
which
till
then
had
been
undreamt
of
continued
the
is
sufficient
to
know
that
he
did
so
and
that
ti
hung
agreed
to
his
terms
only
stipulating
that
li
ting
should
not
be
made
aware
of
his
dismissal
until
he
had
returned
and
given
in
his
accounts
the
share
of
the
profits
that
yung
was
to
receive
was
cut
down
very
low
by
ti
hung
but
the
young
man
did
not
mind
that
as
he
would
live
with
his
for
the
future
the
introduction
of
this
new
system
the
business
increased
like
a
river
at
all
rivals
were
left
far
behind
and
ti
hung
put
out
this
sign
waiting
here
have
you
worshipped
one
of
ti
refined
cash
idols
the
purchasers
of
idols
at
other
establishments
where
they
have
grown
old
and
venerable
while
waiting
for
the
proprietors
to
count
up
to
ten
come
to
the
shop
of
ti
hung
and
regain
their
lost
youth
our
cash
idols
are
worth
a
tael
a
set
we
do
not
however
claim
that
they
will
do
everything
the
cash
idols
of
ti
hung
will
not
for
example
purify
linen
but
even
the
most
contented
and
person
can
not
be
happy
until
he
possesses
one
what
is
happiness
the
exceedingly
philosopher
defines
it
as
the
accomplishment
of
all
our
desires
everyone
desires
one
of
the
ti
cash
idols
therefore
get
one
but
be
sure
that
it
is
ti
you
a
bad
idol
if
so
dismiss
it
and
get
one
of
ti
cash
specimens
does
your
idol
look
old
sooner
than
your
neighbours
because
yours
is
not
one
of
ti

marvels
bring
all
delights
to
the

and
the

the

in

on
the
evening
before
the

was
about
this
time
that
li

returned
his
journey
had
been
more
than
usually
successful
and
he
was
well
satisfied
in
consequence
it
was
not
until
he
had
made
out
his
accounts
and
handed
in
his
money
that
ti
hung
informed
him
of
his
agreement
with
yung

most
treacherous
and
excessively
unpopular
ti

exclaimed
li
ting
in
a
terrible
voice
is
the
return
you
make
for
all
my
entrancing
efforts
in
your
services
then
it
is
in
this
way
that
you
reward
my
exceedingly
unconscientious
recommendations
of
your
very
inferior
and
unendurable
clay
idols
with
their
goggle
eyes
and
concave
stomachs
before
i
go
however
i
request
to
be
inspired
to
make
the
following
remark
that
i
confidently
predict
your
ruin
and
now
this
low
and
undignified
person
will
finally
shake
the
elegant
dust
of
your
distinguished
house
from
his
thoroughly
inadequate
feet
and
proceed
to
offer
his
incapable
services
to
the
rival
establishment
over
the
machinations
of
such
an
person
as
li
ting
will
certainly
be
exceedingly
subtle
said
ti
hung
to
his
when
the
traveller
had
departed
must
counteract
his
omens
herewith
i
wish
to
prophecy
that
henceforth
i
shall
enjoy
an
unbroken
run
of
good
fortune
i
have
spoken
and
assuredly
i
shall
not
eat
my
the
time
went
on
it
seemed
as
though
ti
hung
had
indeed
spoken
truly
the
ease
and
celerity
with
which
he
transacted
his
business
brought
him
customers
and
dealers
from
more
remote
regions
than
ever
for
they
could
spend
days
on
the
journey
and
still
save
time
the
army
of
and
modellers
grew
larger
and
larger
and
the
stretched
almost
down
to
the
edge
only
one
thing
troubled
ti
hung
and
that
was
the
uncongenial
disposition
of
his
for
yung
took
no
further
interest
in
the
industry
to
which
his
discovery
had
given
so
great
an
impetus
but
resolutely
set
to
work
again
to
pass
his
examination
for
the
second
degree
is
an
exceedingly
distinguished
and
honourable
thing
to
have
failed
times
and
still
to
be
undiscouraged
admitted
ti
hung
i
can
not
cleanse
my
throat
from
bitterness
when
i
consider
that
my
noble
and
lucrative
business
must
pass
into
the
hands
of
strangers
perhaps
even
into
the
possession
of
the
unendurable
li
it
had
been
appointed
that
this
degrading
thing
should
not
happen
however
and
it
was
indeed
fortunate
that
yung
did
not
abandon
his
literary
pursuits
for
after
some
time
it
became
very
apparent
to
ti
hung
that
there
was
something
radically
wrong
with
his
business
it
was
not
that
his
custom
was
falling
off
in
any
way
indeed
it
had
lately
increased
in
a
manner
that
was
phenomenal
and
when
the
merchant
came
to
look
into
the
matter
he
found
to
his
astonishment
that
the
least
order
he
had
received
in
the
past
week
had
been
for
a
hundred
idols
all
the
sales
had
been
large
and
yet
ti
hung
found
himself
most
unaccountably
deficient
in
taels
he
was
puzzled
and
alarmed
and
for
the
next
few
days
he
looked
into
the
business
closely
then
it
was
that
the
reason
was
revealed
both
for
the
falling
off
in
the
receipts
and
for
the
increase
in
the
orders
the
calculations
of
the
unfortunate
yung
chang
were
correct
up
to
a
hundred
but
at
that
number
he
had
made
a
gigantic
error
which
however
he
was
never
able
to
detect
and
rectify
with
the
result
that
all
transactions
above
that
point
worked
out
at
a
considerable
loss
to
the
seller
it
was
in
vain
that
the
ti
hung
goaded
his
miserable
to
correct
the
mistake
it
was
equally
in
vain
that
he
tried
to
stem
the
current
of
his
enormous
commercial
popularity
he
had
competed
for
public
favour
and
he
had
won
it
and
every
day
his
business
increased
till
ruin
grasped
him
by
the
pigtail
then
came
an
order
from
one
firm
at
peking
for
five
millions
of
the
cash
idols
and
at
that
ti
hung
put
up
his
shutters
and
sat
down
in
the
dust
he
exclaimed
the
course
of
a
lifetime
there
are
many
very
disagreeable
evils
that
may
overtake
a
person
he
may
offend
the
sacred
dragon
and
be
in
consequence
reduced
to
a
fine
dry
powder
or
he
may
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
benevolent
and
emperor
and
be
condemned
to
death
by
roasting
he
may
also
be
troubled
by
demons
or
by
the
disturbed
spirits
of
his
ancestors
or
be
struck
by
thunderbolts
indeed
there
are
numerous
annoyances
but
they
become
as
blessings
in
comparison
to
a
and
more
than
ordinarily
of
what
avail
is
it
that
i
have
habitually
sold
one
idol
for
the
value
of
a
hundred
the
very
objectionable
man
in
possession
sits
in
my
delectable
and
the
unavoidable
legal
documents
settle
around
me
like
a
flock
of
pigeons
it
is
indeed
necessary
that
i
should
declare
myself
to
be
in
voluntary
liquidation
and
make
an
assignment
of
my
book
debts
for
the
benefit
of
my
creditors
having
accomplished
this
i
will
proceed
to
the
tomb
of
my
illustrious
ancestors
and
having
at
their
incomparable
shrines
i
will
put
an
end
to
my
distinguished
troubles

exceedingly
wise

adapt
himself

at
as
a
rebuke
to
wang

and
certain
others
who
had
questioned
the
practical
value
of
his
stories
is
an
undoubted
fact
that
this
person
has
not
realized
the
direct
remunerative
advantage
which
he
confidently
anticipated

the
idle
and
discontented
wang
yu
as
with
a
few
other
persons
of
similar
inclination
he
sat
in
the
shade
of
the
great
mulberry
tree
at
waiting
for
the
evil
influence
of
certain
very
mysterious
sounds
which
had
lately
been
heard
to
pass
away
before
he
resumed
his
occupation
the
seemingly
proficient
and
trustworthy

first
made
it
his
practice
to
journey
to
and
narrate
to
us
the
doings
of
persons
of
all
classes
of
life

continued

to
this
one
that
by
closely
following
the
recital
of
how
mandarins
obtained
their
high
position
and
exceptionally
rich
persons
their
wealth
he
must
in
the
end
inevitably
be
rendered
competent
to
follow
in
their
illustrious
footsteps
yet
in
how
entirely
contrary
a
direction
has
the
whole
course
of
events
tended
in
spite
of
the
honourable
intention
which
involved
a
frequent
absence
from
his
place
of
commerce
those
who
journeyed
thither
with
the
set
purpose
of
possessing
one
of
his
opium
pipes
so
perversely
regarded
the
matter
that
after
two
or
three
fruitless
visits
they
deliberately
turned
their
footsteps
towards
the
workshop
of
the
inelegant
whose
pipes
are
confessedly
greatly
inferior
to
those
produced
by
the
person

is
now
speaking
nevertheless
the
rapacious
kai
lung
to
whose
influence
the
falling
off
in
custom
was
thus
directly
attributable
persistently
declined
to
bear
any
share
whatever
in
the
loss
which
his
profession
caused
and
indeed
regarded
the
circumstance
from
so
grasping
and
a
point
of
observation
that
he
would
not
even
go
to
the
length
of
suffering
this
one
to
join
the
circle
of
his
hearers
without
on
every
occasion
making
the
customary
offering
in
this
manner
a
pursuit
of
riches
has
insidiously
led
this
person
within
measurable
distance
of
the
bolted
dungeon
for
those
who
do
not
meet
their
just
debts
while
the
only
distinction
likely
to
result
from
his
assiduous
study
of
the
customs
and
methods
of
those
high
in
power
is
that
of
being
publicly
bowstrung
as
a
warning
to

a
dispassionate
voice
behind
them
a
person
of
limited
intelligence
on
being
assured
that
he
would
certainly
one
day
enjoy
an
adequate
competence
if
he
closely
followed
the
industrious
habits
of
the
thrifty
bee
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
anointing
his
thighs
with
the
yellow
powder
which
he
laboriously
collected
from
the
flowers
of
the
field
it
is
not
so
recorded
but
doubtless
the
nameless
one
in
question
was
by
profession
a
maker
of
opium
pipes
for
this
person
has
observed
from
time
to
time
how
that
occupation
above
all
others
tends
to
degrade
the
mental
faculties
and
to
debase
its
followers
to
a
lower
position
than
that
of
the
beasts
of

therefrom
o
superficial
wang

that
wisdom
lies
in
an
intelligent
perception
of
great
principles
and
not
in
a
slavish
imitation

for
the
most
part

and

may
indeed

sullenly
for
it
was
the
in
question
who
had
approached
unperceived
and
who
now
stood
before
them
it
is
none
the
less
a
fact
that
on
the
last
occasion
when
this
misguided
person
joined
the
attending
circle
at
your
uplifted
voice
a
mandarin
of
the
third
degree
chanced
to
pass
through
and
halted
at
the
of
fountain
of
beauty
fully
intending
to
entrust
this
one
with
the
designing
and
fashioning
of
a
pipe
of
exceptional
elaborateness
this
matter
by
his
absence
has
now
passed
from
him
and
through
listening
to
the
narrative
of
how
the
accomplished
doubled
his
fortune
he
is
the
poorer
by
many
when
the
name
of
the
mandarin
of
the
third
degree
appears
in
the
list
of
persons
who
have
transferred
their
entire
property
to
those
who
are
nearly
related
to
them
in
order
to
avoid
it
being
seized
to
satisfy
the
just
claims
made
against
them
replied
kai

will
be
able
to
regard
yourself
the
richer
by
so
many
at
these
words
which
recalled
to
the
minds
of
all
who
were
present
the
not
uncommon
manner
of
behaving
observed
by
those
of
exalted
rank
who
freely
engaged
persons
to
supply
them
with
costly
articles
without
in
any
way
regarding
the
price
to
be
paid
wang
yu
was
silent
exclaimed
a
thin
voice
from
the
edge
of
the
group
which
surrounded
kai
lung
in
nowise
follows
that
the
stories
are
in
themselves
excellent
or
of
such
a
nature
that
the
hearing
of
their
recital
will
profit
a
person
wang
yu
may
be
satisfied
with
empty
words
but
there
are
others
present
who
were
studying
deep
matters
when
wang
yu
was
learning
the
art
of
walking
if
kai
stories
are
of
such
remunerative
benefit
as
the
person
in
question
claims
how
does
it
chance
that
kai
lung
himself
who
is
assuredly
the
best
acquainted
with
them
stands
before
us
in
mean
apparel
and
on
all
occasions
confessing
an
unassuming
poverty
is
pung
went
from
mouth
to
mouth
among
the
bystanders
pung
who
traces
on
paper
the
words
of
chants
and
historical
tales
and
sells
them
to
such
as
can
afford
to
buy
and
although
his
motive
in
exposing
the
emptiness
of
kai
stories
may
not
be
inasmuch
as
kai
lung
provides
us
with
such
matter
as
he
himself
purveys
only
at
a
much
more
moderate
price
yet
his
words
are
well
considered
and
must
therefore
be
pung
replied
kai
lung
hearing
the
name
from
those
who
stood
about
him
and
moving
towards
the
aged
person
who
stood
meanwhile
leaning
upon
his
staff
and
looking
from
side
to
side
with
quickly
moving
eyelids
in
a
manner
very
offensive
towards
the
just
remark
shows
you
to
be
a
person
of
exceptional
wisdom
even
as
your
legs
prove
you
to
be
one
of
great
bodily
strength
for
justice
is
ever
obvious
and
wisdom
hidden
and
they
who
build
structures
for
endurance
discard
the
straight
and
upright
and
insist
upon
such
an
arch
as
you
so
symmetrically
speaking
in
this
conciliatory
manner
kai
lung
came
up
to
pung
and
taking
between
his
fingers
a
disc
of
thick
polished
crystal
which
the
aged
and
used
for
the
purpose
of
magnifying
and
bringing
nearer
the
letters
upon
which
he
was
engaged
and
which
hung
around
his
neck
by

aloud

presently
it

apparently
very
conflicting
words
of
the
wise
pung
and
those
of
this
unassuming
but
nevertheless
conscientious
person
who
is
now
addressing

are
in
reality
as
one

with
this
assurance

the

somewhat
so
that
it
engaged
the

and
concentrated
them
upon
the
uncovered
crown
of
the
unsuspecting
and
still
person
before
him
without
a
pause

leapt
high
into
the
air
repeatedly
pressing
his
hand
to
the
spot
thus
selected
and
crying
aloud
dragons
and

but
the
touch
was
as
hot
as
a
scar
left
by
the
uncut
nail
of
the
sublime

the

composedly
passing
it
into
the
hands
of
those
who
stood
near
as
cool
as
the
innermost
leaves
of
the
riverside

declared

said
nothing
further
but
raised
both
his
hands
above
his

as
if
demanding
their
judgment
thereupon
a
loud
shout
went
up
on
his
behalf
for
the
greater
part
of
them
loved
to
see
the
manner
in
which
he
brushed
aside
those
who
would
oppose
him
and
the
sight
of
the
aged
person
pung
leaping
far
into
the
air
had
caused
them
to
become
exceptionally
amused
and
in
consequence
very
amiably
disposed
towards
the
one
who
had
afforded
them
the
entertainment
story
of
sen
heng
began
kai
lung
when
the
discussion
had
terminated
in
the
manner
already
recorded
itself
with
one
who
possessed
an
unsuspecting
and
ingenious
nature
which
him
to
take
an
ordinary
part
in
the
everyday
affairs
of
life
no
matter
how
engaging
such
a
character
rendered
him
among
his
friends
and
relations
having
at
an
early
age
been
entrusted
with
a
burden
of
rice
and
other
produce
from
his
fields
to
dispose
of
in
the
best
possible
manner
at
a
neighbouring
mart
and
having
completed
the
transaction
in
a
manner
extremely
advantageous
to
those
with
whom
he
trafficked
but
very
intolerable
to
the
one
who
had
sent
him
it
at
once
became
apparent
that
some
other
means
of
gaining
a
livelihood
must
be
discovered
for
him
all
doubt
said
his
father
after
considering
the
matter
for
a
period
is
a
case
in
which
one
should
be
governed
by
the
wise
advice
and
example
of
the
mandarin
sire
exclaimed
sen
heng
who
chanced
to
be
present
illiterate
person
who
stands
before
you
is
entirely
unacquainted
with
the
one
to
whom
you
have
referred
nevertheless
he
will
as
you
suggest
at
once
set
forth
and
journeying
with
all
speed
to
the
abode
of
the
estimable
solicit
his
experience
and
a
more
serious
loss
should
be
occasioned
replied
the
father
coldly
is
no
necessity
to
adopt
so
extreme
a
course
the
benevolent
mandarin
in
question
existed
at
a
remote
period
of
the
thang
dynasty
and
the
incident
to
which
an
allusion
has
been
made
arose
in
the
following
way
to
the
public
court
of
the
enlightened
there
came
one
day
a
youth
of
very
inferior
appearance
and
hesitating
manner
who
besought
his
explicit
advice
saying
degraded
and
unprepossessing
being
before
you
o
select
and
venerable
mandarin
is
by
nature
and
attainments
a
person
of
the
utmost
timidity
and
fearfulness
from
this
cause
life
itself
has
become
a
detestable
observance
in
his
eyes
for
those
who
should
be
his
companions
of
both
sexes
hold
him
in
undisguised
contempt
making
various
unendurable
allusions
to
the
colour
and
nature
of
his
internal
organs
whenever
he
would
endeavour
to
join
them
instruct
him
therefore
the
manner
in
which
this
cowardice
may
be
removed
and
no
service
in
return
will
be
esteemed
too
is
a
remedy
replied
the
benevolent
mandarin
without
any
hesitation
whatever
if
properly
carried
out
is
efficacious
beyond
the
possibility
of
failure
certain
component
parts
of
your
body
are
lacking
and
before
the
desired
result
can
be
obtained
these
must
be
supplied
from
without
of
all
courageous
things
the
tiger
is
the
most
fearless
and
in
consequence
it
combines
all
those
ingredients
which
you
require
furthermore
as
the
teeth
of
the
tiger
are
the
instruments
with
which
it
accomplishes
its
vengeful
purpose
there
reside
the
essential
principles
of
its
inimitable
courage
let
the
person
who
seeks
instruction
in
the
matter
therefore
do
as
follows
taking
the
teeth
of
a
tiger
as
soon
as
it
is
slain
and
before
the
essences
have
time
to
return
into
the
body
he
shall
grind
them
to
a
powder
and
mixing
the
powder
with
a
portion
of
rice
consume
it
after
seven
days
he
must
repeat
the
observance
and
yet
again
a
third
time
after
another
similar
lapse
let
him
then
return
for
further
guidance
for
the
present
the
matter
interests
this
person
no
at
these
words
the
youth
departed
filled
with
a
new
and
inspired
hope
for
the
wisdom
of
the
sagacious
was
a
matter
which
did
not
admit
of
any
doubt
whatever
and
he
had
spoken
with
certainty
of
the
success
of
the
experiment
nevertheless
after
several
days
industriously
spent
in
endeavouring
to
obtain
by
purchase
the
teeth
of
a
tiger
the
details
of
the
undertaking
began
to
assume
a
new
and
entirely
unforeseen
aspect
for
those
whom
he
approached
as
being
the
most
likely
to
possess
what
he
required
either
became
very
immoderately
and
disagreeably
amused
at
the
nature
of
the
request
or
regarded
it
as
a
new
and
form
of
ridicule
which
they
prepared
to
avenge
by
blows
and
by
base
remarks
of
the
most
personal
variety
at
length
it
became
unavoidably
obvious
to
the
youth
that
if
he
was
to
obtain
the
articles
in
question
it
would
first
be
necessary
that
he
should
become
adept
in
the
art
of
slaying
tigers
for
in
no
other
way
were
the
required
conditions
likely
to
be
present
although
the
prospect
was
one
which
did
not
greatly
tend
to
allure
him
yet
he
did
not
regard
it
with
the
utterly
incapable
emotions
which
would
have
been
present
on
an
earlier
occasion
for
the
habit
of
continually
guarding
himself
from
the
onslaughts
of
those
who
received
his
inquiry
in
an
attitude
of
distrust
had
inspired
him
with
a
valour
while
his
amiable
and
unrestrained
manner
of
life
increased
his
bodily
vigour
in
every
degree
first
perfecting
himself
in
the
use
of
the
bow
and
arrow
therefore
he
betook
himself
to
a
wild
and
very
extensive
forest
and
there
concealed
himself
among
the
upper
foliage
of
a
tall
tree
standing
by
the
side
of
a
pool
of
water
on
the
second
night
of
his
watch
the
youth
perceived
a
large
but
somewhat
tiger
approaching
the
pool
for
the
purpose
of
quenching
its
thirst
whereupon
he
tremblingly
fitted
an
arrow
to
his
bowstring
and
profiting
by
the
instruction
he
had
received
succeeded
in
piercing
the
creature
to
the
heart
after
fulfilling
the
observance
laid
upon
him
by
the
discriminating
the
youth
determined
to
remain
in
the
forest
and
sustain
himself
upon
such
food
as
fell
to
his
weapons
until
the
time
arrived
when
he
should
carry
out
the
rite
for
the
last
time
at
the
end
of
seven
days
so
subtle
had
he
become
in
all
kinds
of
hunting
and
so
strengthened
by
the
meat
and
herbs
upon
which
he
existed
that
he
disdained
to
avail
himself
of
the
shelter
of
a
tree
but
standing
openly
by
the
side
of
the
water
he
engaged
the
attention
of
the
first
tiger
which
came
to
drink
and
discharged
arrow
after
arrow
into
its
body
with
unfailing
power
and
precision
so
entrancing
indeed
had
the
pursuit
become
that
the
next
seven
days
lengthened
out
into
the
apparent
period
of
as
many
moons
in
such
a
leisurely
manner
did
they
rise
and
fall
on
the
appointed
day
without
waiting
for
the
evening
to
arrive
the
youth
set
out
with
the
first
appearance
of
light
and
penetrated
into
the
most
inaccessible
jungles
crying
aloud
words
of
challenge
to
all
the
beasts
therein
and
accusing
the
ancestors
of
their
race
of
every
imaginable
variety
of
evil
behaviour
yet
so
great
had
become
the
renown
of
the
one
who
stood
forth
and
so
widely
had
the
warning
voice
been
passed
from
tree
to
tree
preparing
all
who
dwelt
in
the
forest
against
his
anger
that
not
even
the
fiercest
replied
openly
though
low
growls
and
mutterings
proceeded
from
every
cave
within
a
distance
around
wearying
quickly
of
such
feeble
and
timorous
demonstrations
the
youth
rushed
into
the
cave
from
which
the
loudest
murmurs
proceeded
and
there
discovered
a
tiger
of
unnatural
size
surrounded
by
the
bones
of
innumerable
ones
whom
it
had
devoured
for
from
time
to
time
its
ravages
became
so
great
and
unbearable
that
armies
were
raised
in
the
neighbouring
villages
and
sent
to
destroy
it
but
more
than
a
few
stragglers
never
returned
plainly
recognizing
that
a
just
and
inevitable
vengeance
had
overtaken
it
the
tiger
made
only
a
very
inferior
exhibition
of
resistance
and
the
youth
having
first
stunned
it
with
a
blow
of
his
closed
hand
seized
it
by
the
middle
and
repeatedly
dashed
its
head
against
the
rocky
sides
of
its
retreat
he
then
performed
for
the
third
time
the
ceremony
enjoined
by
the
mandarin
and
having
cast
upon
the
cringing
and
despicable
forms
concealed
in
the
surrounding
woods
and
caves
a
look
of
dignified
and
ineffable
contempt
set
out
upon
his
homeward
journey
and
in
the
space
of
three
time
reached
the
town
of
the
versatile
exclaimed
that
person
when
lifting
up
his
eyes
he
saw
the
youth
approaching
laden
with
the
skins
of
the
tigers
and
other
spoils
at
least
the
youths
and
maidens
of
your
native
village
will
no
longer
withdraw
themselves
from
the
company
of
so
undoubtedly
heroic
a
mandarin
replied
the
other
casting
both
his
weapons
and
his
trophies
before
his
inspired
feet
has
this
person
to
do
with
the
little
ones
of
either
sex
give
him
rather
the
foremost
place
in
your
company
of
bowmen
so
that
he
may
repay
in
part
the
undoubted
debt
under
which
he
henceforth
this
proposal
found
favour
with
the
so
that
in
course
of
time
the
unassuming
youth
who
had
come
supplicating
his
advice
became
the
valiant
commander
of
his
army
and
the
one
eventually
chosen
to
present
plighting
gifts
to
his
only
the
father
had
completed
the
narrative
of
how
the
youth
became
in
the
end
a
courageous
and
resourceful
leader
of
bowmen
sen
looked
up
and
not
in
any
degree
understanding
the
purpose
of
the
story
or
why
it
had
been
set
forth
before
him
exclaimed
the
counsel
of
the
graceful
and
intelligent
mandarin
was
of
inestimable
service
in
the
case
recorded
and
this
person
would
gladly
adopt
it
as
his
guide
for
the
future
on
the
chance
of
it
leading
to
a
similar
honourable
career
but
alas
there
are
no
tigers
to
be
found
throughout
this
is
a
loss
which
those
who
are
engaged
in
commerce
in
the
city
of
hankow
strive
to
supply
adequately
replied
his
father
who
had
an
assured
feeling
that
it
would
be
of
no
avail
to
endeavour
to
show
sen
that
the
story
which
he
had
just
related
was
one
setting
forth
a
definite
precept
rather
than
fixing
an
exact
manner
of
behaviour
that
reason
he
continued
person
has
concluded
an
arrangement
by
which
you
will
journey
to
that
place
and
there
enter
into
the
house
of
commerce
of
an
expert
and
conscientious
vendor
of
moving
contrivances
among
so
rapacious
and
a
class
of
persons
as
they
of
hankow
it
is
exceedingly
unlikely
that
your
amiable
disposition
will
involve
any
individual
one
in
an
unavoidably
serious
loss
and
even
should
such
an
unforeseen
event
come
to
pass
there
will
at
least
be
the
undeniable
satisfaction
of
the
thought
that
the
unfortunate
occurrence
will
in
no
way
affect
the
prosperity
of
those
to
whom
you
are
bound
by
the
natural
ties
of
and
father
replied
sen
gently
but
speaking
with
an
inspired
conviction
his
earliest
infancy
this
unassuming
one
has
been
instructed
in
an
inviolable
regard
for
the
five
general
principles
of
fidelity
to
the
emperor
respect
for
parents
harmony
between
husband
and
wife
agreement
among
brothers
and
constancy
in
friendship
it
will
be
entirely
unnecessary
to
inform
so
a
person
as
the
one
now
being
addressed
that
no
evil
can
attend
the
footsteps
of
an
individual
who
courteously
observes
these
doubt
it
is
so
arranged
by
the
protecting
deities
replied
the
father
it
is
an
exceedingly
desirable
thing
for
those
who
are
responsible
in
the
matter
that
the
footsteps
to
which
reference
has
been
made
should
not
linger
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
village
but
should
with
all
possible
speed
turn
in
the
direction
of
this
manner
it
came
to
pass
that
sen
heng
set
forth
on
the
following
day
and
coming
without
delay
to
the
great
and
powerful
city
of
hankow
sought
out
the
house
of
commerce
known
as
pure
gilt
dragon
of
exceptional
symmetry
where
the
versatile
engaged
in
the
entrancing
occupation
of
contriving
moving
figures
and
other
devices
of
an
ingenious
and
character
which
he
entrusted
into
the
hands
of
numerous
persons
to
sell
throughout
the
province
from
this
cause
although
enjoying
a
very
agreeable
recompense
from
the
sale
of
the
objects
the
greatly
perturbed
suffered
continual
internal
misgivings
for
the
habit
of
behaving
of
those
whom
he
appointed
to
go
forth
in
the
manner
described
was
such
that
he
could
not
entirely
dismiss
from
his
mind
an
assured
conviction
that
the
details
were
not
invariably
as
they
were
represented
to
be
frequently
would
one
return
in
a
very
deficient
and
unpresentable
condition
of
garment
asserting
that
on
his
return
while
passing
through
a
lonely
and
unprotected
district
he
had
been
assailed
by
an
armed
band
of
robbers
and
despoiled
of
all
he
possessed
another
would
claim
to
have
been
made
the
sport
of
evil
spirits
who
led
him
astray
by
means
of
false
signs
in
the
forest
and
finally
destroyed
his
entire
burden
of
commodities
accompanying
the
unworthy
act
by
loud
cries
of
triumph
and
remarks
of
an
insulting
nature
concerning
for
the
honourable
character
and
charitable
actions
of
the
person
in
question
had
made
him
very
objectionable
to
that
class
of
beings
others
continually
accounted
for
the
absence
of
the
required
number
of
taels
by
declaring
that
at
a
certain
point
of
their
journey
they
were
made
the
object
of
marks
of
amiable
condescension
on
the
part
of
a
high
and
dignified
public
official
who
on
learning
in
whose
service
they
were
immediately
professed
an
intimate
personal
friendship
with
the
estimable
and
out
of
a
feeling
of
gratified
respect
for
him
took
away
all
such
contrivances
as
remained
undisposed
of
promising
to
arrange
the
payment
with
the
refined
himself
when
they
should
next
meet
for
these
reasons
was
especially
desirous
of
obtaining
one
whose
spoken
word
could
be
received
upon
all
points
as
an
assured
fact
and
it
was
therefore
with
an
emotion
of
internal
lightness
that
he
confidently
heard
from
those
who
were
acquainted
with
the
person
that
sen
heng
was
by
nature
and
endowments
utterly
incapable
of
representing
matters
of
even
the
most
insignificant
degree
to
be
otherwise
than
what
they
really
were
filled
with
an
acute
anxiety
to
discover
what
amount
of
success
would
be
accorded
to
his
latest
contrivance
led
sen
heng
to
a
secluded
chamber
and
there
instructed
him
in
the
method
of
selling
certain
apparently
very
ingeniously
constructed
ducks
which
would
have
the
appearance
of
swimming
about
on
the
surface
of
an
open
vessel
of
water
at
the
same
time
uttering
loud
and
cries
after
the
manner
of
their
kind
with
admiration
at
the
skilful
nature
of
the
deception
pointed
out
that
the
ducks
which
were
to
be
disposed
of
and
upon
which
a
seemingly
very
low
price
was
fixed
did
not
in
reality
possess
any
of
these
accomplishments
but
would
on
the
contrary
if
placed
in
water
at
once
sink
to
the
bottom
in
a
most
incapable
manner
it
being
part
of
duty
to
exhibit
only
a
specially
prepared
creature
which
was
restrained
upon
the
surface
by
means
of
hidden
cords
and
while
bending
over
it
to
simulate
the
cries
as
agreed
upon
after
satisfying
himself
that
sen
could
perform
these
movements
competently
sent
him
forth
particularly
charging
him
that
he
should
not
return
without
a
sum
of
money
which
fully
represented
the
entire
number
of
ducks
entrusted
to
him
or
an
adequate
number
of
unsold
ducks
to
compensate
for
the
deficiency
the
end
of
seven
days
sen
returned
to
and
although
entirely
without
money
even
to
the
extent
of
being
unable
to
provide
himself
with
the
merest
necessities
of
a
frugal
existence
he
honourably
returned
the
full
number
of
ducks
with
which
he
had
set
out
it
then
became
evident
that
although
sen
had
diligently
perfected
himself
in
the
sounds
and
movements
which
had
contrived
he
had
not
fully
understood
that
they
were
to
be
executed
stealthily
but
had
in
consequence
manifested
the
accomplishment
openly
not
unreasonably
supposing
that
such
an
exhibition
would
be
an
additional
inducement
to
those
who
appeared
to
be
towards
the
purchase
from
this
cause
it
came
about
that
although
large
crowds
were
attracted
by
manner
of
conducting
the
enterprise
none
actually
engaged
to
purchase
even
the
least
of
the
ducks
although
several
publicly
complimented
sen
on
his
exceptional
proficiency
and
repeatedly
urged
him
to
louder
and
more
frequent
cries
suggesting
that
by
such
means
possible
buyers
might
be
attracted
to
the
spot
from
remote
and
inaccessible
villages
in
the
neighbourhood
learned
how
the
venture
had
been
carried
out
he
became
most
intolerably
in
his
expressions
towards
mental
attainments
and
the
manner
of
his
bringing
up
it
was
entirely
in
vain
that
the
one
referred
to
pointed
out
in
a
tone
of
persuasive
and
courteous
restraint
that
he
had
not
down
to
the
most
minute
particulars
transgressed
either
the
general
or
the
specific
obligations
of
the
five
general
principles
and
that
therefore
he
was
blameless
and
even
worthy
of
commendation
for
the
manner
in
which
he
had
acted
with
an
inelegant
absence
of
all
refined
feeling
most
incapably
declined
to
discuss
the
various
aspects
of
the
controversy
in
an
amiable
manner
asserting
indeed
that
for
the
consideration
of
as
many
brass
cash
as
sen
had
mentioned
principles
he
would
cause
him
to
be
thrown
into
prison
as
a
person
of
unnatural
ineptitude
then
without
rewarding
sen
for
the
time
spent
in
his
service
or
even
inviting
him
to
partake
of
food
and
wine
the
insufferable
deviser
of
very
indifferent
animated
contrivances
again
sent
him
out
this
time
into
the
streets
of
hankow
with
a
number
of
delicately
inlaid
boxes
remarking
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
plainly
indicated
an
exactly
contrary
desire
that
he
would
be
filled
with
an
overwhelming
satisfaction
if
sen
could
discover
any
excuse
for
returning
a
second
time
without
disposing
of
anything
this
remark
ingenuous
nature
led
him
to
regard
as
a
definite
fact
so
that
when
a
who
tarried
to
examine
the
boxes
chanced
to
remark
that
the
colours
might
have
been
arranged
to
greater
advantage
in
which
case
he
would
certainly
have
purchased
at
least
one
of
the
articles
sen
hastened
back
although
in
a
distant
part
of
the
city
to
inform
of
the
suggestion
adding
that
he
himself
had
been
favourably
impressed
with
the
improvement
which
could
be
effected
by
such
an
alteration
nature
of
emotion
when
sen
again
presented
himself
before
him
and
when
by
repeatedly
applied
tests
on
various
parts
of
his
body
he
understood
that
he
was
neither
the
victim
of
malicious
demons
nor
wandering
in
an
insensible
condition
in
the
middle
air
but
that
the
cause
of
the
return
was
such
as
had
been
plainly
stated
was
of
so
mixed
and
benumbing
a
variety
that
for
a
considerable
space
of
time
he
was
quite
unable
to
express
himself
in
any
way
either
by
words
or
by
signs
by
the
time
these
attributes
returned
there
had
formed
itself
within
mind
a
design
of
most
contemptible
malignity
which
seemed
to
present
to
his
enfeebled
intellect
a
scheme
by
which
sen
would
be
adequately
punished
and
finally
disposed
of
without
causing
him
any
further
trouble
in
the
matter
for
this
purpose
he
concealed
the
real
condition
of
his
sentiments
towards
sen
and
warmly
expressed
himself
in
terms
of
delicate
flattery
regarding
that
sumptuous
and
unfailing
taste
in
the
matter
of
the
blending
of
the
colours
without
doubt
he
continued
such
an
alteration
as
the
one
proposed
would
greatly
increase
the
attractiveness
of
the
inlaid
boxes
and
the
matter
should
be
engaged
upon
without
delay
in
the
meantime
however
not
to
waste
the
immediate
services
of
so
discriminating
and
persevering
a
servant
he
would
entrust
sen
with
a
mission
of
exceptional
importance
which
would
certainly
tend
greatly
to
his
remunerative
benefit
in
the
district
of
yun
in
the
part
of
the
province
said
the
crafty
and
treacherous
a
particular
kind
of
insect
was
greatly
esteemed
on
account
of
the
beneficent
influence
which
it
exercised
over
the
rice
plants
causing
them
to
mature
earlier
and
to
attain
a
greater
size
than
ever
happened
in
its
absence
in
recent
years
this
creature
had
rarely
been
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
of
yun
and
in
consequence
the
throughout
that
country
had
been
brought
into
a
most
disconcerting
state
of
poverty
and
would
inevitably
be
prepared
to
exchange
whatever
they
still
possessed
for
even
a
few
of
the
insects
in
order
that
they
might
liberate
them
to
increase
and
so
entirely
reverse
the
objectionable
state
of
things
speaking
in
this
manner
entrusted
to
sen
a
carefully
prepared
box
containing
a
score
of
the
insects
obtained
at
a
great
cost
from
a
country
beyond
the
bitter
water
and
after
giving
him
further
directions
concerning
the
journey
and
enjoining
the
utmost
secrecy
about
the
valuable
contents
of
the
box
he
sent
him
forth
discreet
and
sagacious
will
already
have
understood
the
nature
of
intolerable
artifice
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
amiable
and
unsuspecting
it
is
necessary
to
make
it
clear
that
the
words
which
he
had
spoken
bore
no
sort
of
resemblance
to
affairs
as
they
really
existed
the
district
around
yun
was
indeed
involved
in
a
most
unprepossessing
destitution
but
this
had
been
caused
not
by
the
absence
of
any
rare
and
auspicious
insect
but
by
the
presence
of
vast
hordes
of
locusts
which
had
overwhelmed
and
devoured
the
entire
face
the
country
it
so
chanced
that
among
the
recently
constructed
devices
at
pure
gilt
dragon
of
exceptional
were
a
number
of
elegant
representations
of
rice
fields
and
fruit
gardens
so
skilfully
fashioned
that
they
deceived
even
the
creatures
and
attracted
among
other
living
things
all
the
locusts
in
hankow
into
that
place
of
commerce
it
was
a
number
of
these
insects
that
vindictively
placed
in
the
box
which
he
instructed
sen
to
carry
to
yun
well
knowing
that
the
reception
which
would
be
accorded
to
anyone
who
appeared
there
on
such
a
mission
would
be
of
so
fatally
destructive
a
kind
that
the
consideration
of
his
return
need
not
engage
a
single
conjecture
tranquil
in
intellect
for
the
possibility
of
intention
being
in
any
way
other
than
what
he
had
represented
it
to
be
did
not
arise
within
ingenuous
mind
the
person
in
question
cheerfully
set
forth
on
his
long
but
unavoidable
march
towards
the
region
of
yun
as
he
journeyed
along
the
way
the
nature
of
his
meditation
brought
up
before
him
the
events
which
had
taken
place
since
his
arrival
at
hankow
and
for
the
first
time
it
was
brought
within
his
understanding
that
the
story
of
the
youth
and
the
three
tigers
which
his
father
had
related
to
him
was
in
the
likeness
of
a
proverb
by
which
counsel
and
warning
is
conveyed
in
a
graceful
and
inoffensive
manner
readily
applying
the
fable
to
his
own
condition
he
could
not
doubt
but
that
the
first
two
animals
to
be
overthrown
were
represented
by
the
two
undertakings
which
he
had
already
conscientiously
performed
in
the
matter
of
the
mechanical
ducks
and
the
inlaid
boxes
and
the
conviction
that
he
was
even
then
engaged
on
the
third
and
last
trial
filled
him
with
an
intelligent
gladness
so
unobtrusive
and
refined
that
he
could
express
his
entrancing
emotions
in
no
other
way
than
by
lifting
up
his
voice
and
uttering
the
cries
which
he
had
used
on
the
first
of
the
occasions
just
referred
to
this
manner
the
first
part
of
the
journey
passed
away
with
engaging
celerity
anxious
as
sen
undoubtedly
was
to
complete
the
third
task
and
approach
the
details
which
in
his
own
case
would
correspond
with
the
command
of
the
bowmen
and
the
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
the
person
in
the
story
the
noontide
heat
compelled
him
to
rest
in
the
shade
by
the
wayside
for
a
lengthy
period
each
day
during
one
of
these
pauses
it
occurred
to
his
versatile
mind
that
the
time
which
was
otherwise
uselessly
expended
might
be
well
disposed
of
in
endeavouring
to
increase
the
value
and
condition
of
the
creatures
under
his
care
by
instructing
them
in
the
performance
of
some
simple
accomplishments
such
as
might
not
be
too
laborious
for
their
feeble
and
immature
understanding
in
this
he
was
more
successful
than
he
had
imagined
could
possibly
be
the
case
for
the
discriminating
insects
from
the
first
had
every
appearance
of
recognizing
that
sen
was
inspired
by
a
sincere
regard
for
their
ultimate
benefit
and
was
not
merely
using
them
for
his
own
advancement
so
assiduously
did
they
devote
themselves
to
their
allotted
tasks
that
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
there
was
no
detail
in
connexion
with
their
own
simple
domestic
arrangements
that
was
not
understood
and
daily
carried
out
by
an
appointed
band
entranced
at
this
intelligent
manner
of
conducting
themselves
sen
industriously
applied
his
time
to
the
more
congenial
task
of
instructing
them
in
the
refined
arts
and
presently
he
had
the
enchanting
satisfaction
of
witnessing
a
number
of
the
most
cultivated
faultlessly
and
unhesitatingly
perform
a
portion
of
the
play
entitled
benevolent
omen
of
white
dragon
tea
garden
or
three
times
a
not
even
content
with
this
elevating
display
sen
ingeniously
contrived
from
various
objects
which
he
discovered
at
different
points
by
the
wayside
an
effective
and
representation
of
a
for
which
he
trained
a
crew
who
at
an
agreed
signal
would
take
up
their
appointed
places
and
go
through
the
required
movements
both
of
sailing
and
of
discharging
the
guns
in
a
reliable
and
efficient
manner
sen
was
one
day
educating
the
least
competent
of
the
insects
in
the
simpler
parts
of
and
the
like
to
their
more
graceful
and
versatile
companions
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
beheld
standing
by
his
side
a
person
of
very
elaborately
embroidered
apparel
and
commanding
personality
who
had
all
the
appearance
of
one
who
had
been
observing
his
movements
for
some
space
of
time
calling
up
within
his
remembrance
the
warning
which
he
had
received
from
sen
was
preparing
to
restore
the
creatures
to
their
closed
box
when
the
stranger
in
a
loud
and
dignified
voice
commanded
him
to
refrain
adding
is
resting
at
a
spot
within
the
immediate
neighbourhood
a
person
of
illustrious
name
and
ancestry
who
would
doubtless
be
gratified
to
witness
the
diverting
actions
of
which
this
one
has
recently
been
a
spectator
as
the
reward
of
a
tael
can
not
be
unwelcome
to
a
person
of
your
inferior
appearance
and
unpresentable
garments
take
up
your
box
without
delay
and
follow
the
one
who
is
now
before
these
words
the
stranger
led
the
way
through
a
narrow
woodland
path
closely
followed
by
sen
to
whom
the
attraction
of
the
promised
reward
a
larger
sum
indeed
than
he
had
ever
possessed
was
sufficiently
alluring
to
make
him
determined
that
the
other
should
not
for
the
briefest
possible
moment
pass
beyond
his
sight
to
withhold
that
which
sen
was
entirely
ignorant
of
until
a
later
period
it
is
now
revealed
that
the
person
in
question
was
the
official
provider
of
diversions
and
pleasurable
occupations
to
the
sacred
and
illimitable
emperor
who
was
then
engaged
in
making
an
unusually
extensive
march
through
the
eight
provinces
surrounding
his
capital
for
the
acute
and
will
not
need
to
be
reminded
that
nanking
occupied
that
position
at
the
time
now
engaged
with
until
his
providential
discovery
of
sen
the
distinguished
provider
had
been
immersed
in
a
most
unenviable
condition
of
despair
for
his
enlightened
but
exceedingly
master
had
of
late
declined
to
be
in
any
way
amused
or
even
interested
by
the
simple
and
unpretentious
entertainment
which
could
be
obtained
in
so
inaccessible
a
region
the
efforts
of
the
followers
of
the
court
who
engagingly
endeavoured
to
divert
the
imperial
mind
by
performing
certain
feats
which
they
remembered
to
have
witnessed
on
previous
occasions
but
which
until
the
necessity
arose
they
had
never
essayed
were
entirely
without
result
of
a
beneficial
order
even
the
accomplished
one
attainment
that
of
striking
together
both
the
hands
and
the
feet
thrice
simultaneously
while
leaping
into
the
air
and
at
the
same
time
producing
a
sound
not
unlike
that
emitted
by
a
large
and
vigorous
bee
when
held
captive
in
the
fold
of
a
robe
an
action
which
never
failed
to
throw
the
illustrious
emperor
into
a
most
uncontrollable
state
of
amusement
when
performed
within
the
imperial
palace
now
only
drew
from
him
the
unsympathetic
if
not
actually
offensive
remark
that
the
attitude
and
the
noise
bore
a
marked
resemblance
to
those
produced
by
a
person
when
being
bowstrung
adding
with
unprepossessing
significance
that
of
the
two
entertainments
he
had
an
unevadable
conviction
that
the
bowstringing
would
be
the
more
acceptable
and
sen
beheld
the
size
and
the
magnificence
of
the
camp
into
which
his
guide
led
him
he
was
filled
with
astonishment
and
at
the
same
time
recognized
that
he
had
acted
in
an
injudicious
and
hasty
manner
by
so
readily
accepting
the
offer
of
a
tael
whereas
if
he
had
been
in
possession
of
the
true
facts
of
the
case
as
they
now
appeared
he
would
certainly
have
endeavoured
to
obtain
double
that
amount
before
consenting
as
he
was
hesitating
within
himself
whether
the
matter
might
not
even
yet
be
arranged
in
a
more
advantageous
manner
he
was
suddenly
led
forward
into
the
most
striking
and
ornamental
of
the
tents
and
commanded
to
engage
the
attention
of
the
one
in
whose
presence
he
found
himself
without
delay
the
first
moment
when
the
inimitable
creatures
began
at
spoken
word
to
go
through
the
ordinary
details
of
their
domestic
affairs
there
was
no
sort
of
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
the
success
with
which
their
exertions
would
be
received
the
dark
shadows
instantly
forsook
the
enraptured
select
brow
and
from
time
to
time
he
expressed
himself
in
words
of
most
unrestrained
and
intimate
encouragement
so
exuberant
became
the
overjoyed
emotion
at
having
at
length
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
services
of
one
who
was
able
to
recall
his
imperial
unclouded
countenance
that
he
came
forward
in
a
most
unpresentable
state
of
haste
and
rose
into
the
air
uncommanded
for
the
display
of
his
usually
not
unwelcome
acquirement
this
he
would
doubtless
have
executed
competently
had
not
sen
who
stood
immediately
behind
him
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
raised
his
voice
in
a
very
vigorous
and
proficient
duck
cry
thereby
causing
the
one
before
him
to
endeavour
to
turn
around
in
alarm
while
yet
in
the
air
an
intermingled
state
of
movements
of
both
the
body
and
the
mind
that
caused
him
to
abandon
his
original
intention
in
a
manner
which
removed
the
gravity
of
the
emperor
to
an
even
more
pronounced
degree
than
had
been
effected
by
the
diverting
attitudes
of
the
insects
the
gratified
emperor
had
beheld
every
portion
of
the
tasks
which
sen
had
instilled
into
the
minds
of
the
insects
down
even
to
the
minutest
detail
he
called
the
provider
before
him
and
addressing
him
in
a
voice
which
might
be
designed
to
betray
either
sternness
or
an
amiable
indulgence
said
o
are
reported
to
be
a
person
of
no
particular
intellect
or
discernment
and
for
this
reason
these
ones
who
are
speaking
have
a
desire
to
know
how
the
matter
will
present
itself
in
your
eyes
which
is
it
the
more
commendable
and
honourable
for
a
person
to
train
to
a
condition
of
unfailing
excellence
human
beings
of
confessed
intelligence
or
insects
of
a
low
and
degraded
standard
this
remark
the
discriminating
made
no
reply
being
indeed
undecided
in
his
mind
whether
such
a
course
was
expected
of
him
on
several
previous
occasions
the
somewhat
introspective
emperor
had
addressed
himself
to
persons
in
what
they
judged
to
be
the
form
of
a
question
as
one
might
say
blue
is
the
unapproachable
air
canopy
and
how
delicately
imagined
the
colour
of
the
clouds
yet
when
they
had
expressed
their
deliberate
opinion
on
the
subjects
referred
to
stating
the
exact
degree
of
blueness
and
the
like
the
nature
of
their
reception
ever
afterwards
was
such
that
for
the
future
persons
endeavoured
to
determine
exactly
the
intention
of
the
mind
before
declaring
themselves
in
words
being
exceedingly
doubtful
on
this
occasion
therefore
the
very
cautious
adopted
the
more
prudent
and
uncompromising
attitude
and
smiling
acquiescently
he
raised
both
his
hands
with
a
movement
exclaimed
the
emperor
in
a
tone
which
plainly
indicated
that
the
evasive
had
adopted
a
course
which
did
not
commend
itself
unendurable
a
condition
of
affairs
is
it
for
a
person
of
acute
mental
perception
to
be
annoyed
by
the
inopportune
behaviour
of
one
who
is
only
fit
to
mix
on
terms
of
equality
with
beggars
and
street
cleaners
a
condition
of
affairs
is
indeed
most
offensively
unbearable
illustrious
being
remarked
who
clearly
perceived
that
his
former
silence
had
not
been
productive
of
a
delicate
state
of
feeling
towards
himself
has
frequently
been
said
continued
the
courteous
and
emperor
only
signifying
his
refined
displeasure
at
really
observation
by
so
arranging
his
position
that
the
person
in
question
on
longer
enjoyed
the
sublime
distinction
of
gazing
upon
his
benevolent
face
titles
and
offices
have
been
accorded
from
time
to
time
without
any
regard
for
the
fitting
qualifications
of
those
to
whom
they
were
presented
the
truth
that
such
a
state
of
things
does
occasionally
exist
has
been
brought
before
our
eyes
during
the
past
few
days
by
the
abandoned
and
inefficient
behaviour
of
one
who
will
henceforth
be
a
marked
official
yet
it
has
always
been
our
endeavour
to
reward
expert
and
unassuming
merit
whenever
it
is
discovered
as
we
were
setting
forth
when
we
were
interrupted
in
a
most
obstinate
and
superfluous
manner
the
one
who
can
guide
and
cultivate
the
minds
of
unthinking
and
not
infrequently
obstinate
and
rapacious
insects
would
certainly
enjoy
an
even
greater
measure
of
success
if
entrusted
with
the
discriminating
intellects
of
human
beings
for
this
reason
it
appears
that
no
more
fitting
person
could
be
found
to
occupy
the
important
and
position
of
chief
arranger
of
the
competitive
examinations
than
the
one
before
us
provided
his
opinions
and
manner
of
expressing
himself
are
such
as
commend
themselves
to
us
to
satisfy
us
on
this
point
let
sen

now
stand
forth
and
declare
his
this
invitation
sen
advanced
the
requisite
number
of
paces
and
not
in
any
degree
understanding
what
was
required
of
him
determined
that
the
occasion
was
one
when
he
might
fittingly
declare
the
five
general
principles
which
were
ever
present
in
his
mind
fidelity
to
the
sacred
emperor
he
began
when
the
person
in
question
signified
that
the
trial
was
over
so
competent
and
inspired
an
expression
as
that
which
has
just
been
uttered
which
if
rightly
considered
includes
all
lesser
things
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
more

which

already
been
specified

now
declared
to
be
legally
conferred

evening
will
be
devoted
to
a
repetition
of
the
entrancing
manoeuvres
performed
by
the
insects
to
be
followed
by
a
feast
and
music
in
honour
of
the
recognized
worth
and
position
of
the
accomplished
sen
heng
there
is
really
no
necessity
for
the
apparently
to
attend
the
such
a
manner
was
the
foundation
of
ultimate
prosperity
established
by
which
he
came
in
the
process
of
time
to
occupy
a
very
high
place
in
public
esteem
yet
being
a
person
of
conscientiousness
he
did
not
hesitate
when
questioned
by
those
who
made
pilgrimages
to
him
for
the
purpose
of
learning
by
what
means
he
had
risen
to
so
remunerative
a
position
to
ascribe
his
success
not
entirely
to
his
own
intelligent
perception
of
persons
and
events
but
in
part
also
to
a
regard
for
the
dictates
of
the
five
general
principles
and
a
discriminating
subservience
to
the
inspired
wisdom
of
the
venerable
as
conveyed
to
him
in
the
story
of
the
youth
and
the
three
tigers
this
story
sen
furthermore
caused
to
be
inscribed
in
letters
of
gold
and
displayed
in
a
prominent
position
in
his
native
village
where
it
has
since
doubtless
been
the
means
of
instructing
and
advancing
countless
observant
ones
who
have
not
been
too
insufferable
to
be
guided
by
the
experience
of

by

the
occasion

his
receiving
a
very
unexpected
reward

certainly
many
occasions
when
the
principles
of
the

to
find
practical
favour
in
the

uncomplaining

kai

with
patient
resignation

without
any

of

either
one
way
or
the
other
it
is
an
undeniable
fact
that
they
reward
this
commonplace
too
often
underestimated
efforts
in
a
manner
which
betrays
them
either
to
be
of
noble
birth
or
very
desirous
of
putting
to
shame

less
prosperous
neighbouring
exhibitions
of

merely
the
signs
of
an
and
inordinate
vanity
remarked
a
mandarin
of
the
eighth
grade
who
chanced
to
be
passing
and
who
stopped
to
listen
to
kai

it
is
not
fitting
that

collection
of
decaying
hovels
which
assuredly
is

however
small
a
detail
appear
to
rise
above

so
that
if
the
versatile
and
unassuming
kai

again
honour
this
assembly
by
allowing
his
bowl
to
pass
freely
to
and
fro
this
obscure
and
otherwise
entirely
superfluous

encouraging
words
the
very
opportune

of

eighth

followed
the

closely
what
each

contributed
so
that
although
he
gave
nothing

never

received
so
honourable
an
amount
illustrious

exclaimed
a
very
industrious
and
who
in
spite
of
his
poverty
could
not
refrain
from
mingling
with
listeners
whenever

in

piece
of

to
this
person
more
than
a

twice

a
courteous

individual
who
possesses
certain
written
papers
of

the
repayment
of
some
few
taels
walked
behind
the
bowl
and
engaged
his
eyes
with
an
unmistakable
and
very
significant
glance
this
fact
emboldens
him
to
make
the
following
petition
that

place
of
the
not
altogether
unknown
story
of
yung

which
had
been
announced
the
proficient
and
kai

will
entice
our
attention
with
the
history
of
the
mandarin
chan

to
which
reference
has
already
been
occasion

undoubtedly
one
which
calls
for
recognition
to
an
unusual
degree
replied
kai

with
extreme
affability
that
end
this
person
will
accordingly
narrate
the
story
which
has
been
suggested
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
has
been
specially
prepared
for
the
ears
of
the
sublime
emperor
who
is
at
this
moment
awaiting
this
unseemly
arrival
in
peking
with
every
mark
of
impatience
tempered
only
by
his
expectation
of
being
the
first
to
hear
the
story
of
the
but
somewhat
premature
chan
hung
mandarin
in
question
lived
during
the
reign
of
the
accomplished
emperor
his
yamen
being
at
fow
hou
in
the
province
of
of
which
place
he
was
consequently
the
chief
official
in
his
conscientious
desire
to
administer
a
pure
and
beneficent
rule
he
not
infrequently
made
himself
a
very
prominent
object
for
public
disregard
especially
by
his
attempts
to
introduce
untried
things
when
from
time
to
time
such
matters
arose
within
his
mind
and
seemed
to
promise
agreeable
and
remunerative
results
in
this
manner
it
came
about
that
the
streets
of
fow
hou
were
covered
with
large
flat
stones
to
the
great
inconvenience
of
those
persons
who
had
from
a
very
remote
period
been
in
the
habit
of
passing
the
night
on
the
soft
clay
which
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
afforded
a
pleasant
and
efficient
nevertheless
in
certain
matters
his
engaging
efforts
were
attended
by
an
obvious
success
having
noticed
that
misfortunes
and
losses
are
much
less
keenly
felt
when
they
immediately
follow
in
the
steps
of
an
earlier
evil
the
benevolent
and
chan
hung
devised
an
ingenious
method
of
lightening
the
burden
of
a
necessary
taxation
by
arranging
that
those
persons
who
were
the
most
heavily
involved
should
be
made
the
victims
of
an
attack
and
robbery
on
the
night
before
the
matter
became
due
by
this
thoughtful
expedient
the
unpleasant
duty
of
parting
from
so
many
taels
was
almost
imperceptibly
led
up
to
and
when
after
the
lapse
of
some
slight
period
the
first
sums
of
money
were
secretly
returned
with
a
written
proverb
appropriate
to
the
occasion
the
public
rejoicing
of
those
who
had
the
matter
been
left
to
its
natural
course
would
still
have
been
filling
the
air
with
bitter
and
unendurable
lamentations
plainly
testified
to
the
inspired
wisdom
of
the
enlightened
mandarin
success
of
this
amiable
expedient
caused
the
mandarin
chan
hung
every
variety
of
intelligent
emotion
and
no
day
passed
without
him
devoting
a
portion
of
his
time
to
the
labour
of
discovering
other
advantages
of
a
similar
nature
engrossed
in
deep
and
very
sublime
thought
of
this
order
he
chanced
upon
a
certain
day
to
be
journeying
through
fow
hou
when
he
met
a
person
of
irregular
intellect
who
made
an
uncertain
livelihood
by
following
the
unassuming
and
from
place
to
place
chanting
in
a
loud
voice
set
verses
recording
their
virtues
which
he
composed
in
their
honour
on
account
of
his
undoubted
infirmities
this
person
was
permitted
a
greater
freedom
of
speech
with
those
above
him
than
would
have
been
the
case
had
his
condition
been
merely
ordinary
so
that
when
chan
hung
observed
him
becoming
very
grossly
amused
on
his
approach
to
such
an
extent
indeed
that
he
neglected
to
perform
any
of
the
fitting
acts
of
obeisance
the
wise
and
mandarin
did
not
in
any
degree
suffer
his
complacency
to
be
affected
but
drawing
near
addressed
him
in
a
calm
and
dignified
manner
o
he
said
you
permit
your
gravity
to
be
removed
to
such
an
exaggerated
degree
at
the
sight
of
this
in
no
way
striking
or
exceptional
person
and
why
indeed
do
you
stand
in
so
unbecoming
an
attitude
in
the
presence
of
one
who
in
spite
of
his
depraved
inferiority
is
unquestionably
your
official
superior
and
could
without
any
hesitation
condemn
you
to
the
tortures
or
even
to
bowstringing
on
the
spot
exclaimed
stepping
up
to
chan
hung
and
without
any
hesitation
pressing
the
gilt
button
which
adorned
the
body
garment
accompanying
the
action
by
a
continuous
muffled
noise
which
suggested
the
repeated
striking
of
a
hidden
bell
wonder
that
this
person
stands
erect
on
your
approach
neither
rolling
his
lowered
head
repeatedly
from
side
to
side
nor
tracing
circles
in
the
dust
of
fow

with
his
submissive
stomach

then
the
meaning
of
the
proverb
an
inordinate
appearance
of
servility
the
estimable
person
who
retires
from
your
presence
walking
backwards
may
adopt
that
deferential
manner
in
order
to
keep
concealed
the
long
knife
with
which
he
had
hoped
to
slay
the
excessive
amusement
that
seized
this
offensive
person
when
he
beheld
your
figure
in
the
distance
arose
from
his
perception
of
your
internal
satisfaction
which
is
indeed
unmistakably
reflected
in
your
symmetrical
countenance
for
o
mandarin
in
spite
of
your
honourable
endeavours
to
turn
things
which
are
devious
into
a
straight
line
the
matters
upon
which
you
engage
your
versatile
intellect
little
as

chan
hung
whose
feelings
were
evenly
balanced
between
a
desire
to
know
what
thing
he
had
neglected
and
a
fear
that
his
dignity
might
suffer
if
he
were
observed
to
remain
long
conversing
with
a
person
of
low
mental
attainments

and
with
an
entire
absence
of
lengthy
and
ornamental
forms
of
speech
express
the
omission
to
which
you
have
made
reference
for
this
person
has
an
uneasy
inside
emotion
that
you
are
merely
endeavouring
to
engage
his
attention
to
the
end
that
you
may
make
an
unseemly
and
irrelevant
reply
and
thereby
involve
him
in
an
undeserved
a
device
would
be
the
pastime
of
one
of
immature
years
and
could
have
no
place
in
this
habit
of
conduct

with
every
appearance
of
a
fixed
sincerity
the
matter

one
which
touches
his
own
welfare
closely
and
expressed
in
the
fashion
which
the
proficient
mandarin
has
commanded
may
be
set
forth
as
follows
by
a
wise
and
divine
system
it
is
arranged
that
certain
honourable
occupations
which
by
their
nature
can
not
become
remunerative
to
any
marked
degree
shall
be
singled
out
for
special
marks
of
reverence
so
that
those
who
engage
therein
may
be
compensated
in
dignity
for
what
they
must
inevitably
lack
in
taels
by
this
refined
dispensation
the
literary
occupations
which
are
in
general
the
highroads
to
the
establishment
of
public
support
and
uniform
apparel
are
held
in
the
highest
veneration
agriculture
from
which
it
is
possible
to
wrest
a
competency
follows
in
esteem
while
the
various
branches
of
commerce
leading
as
they
do
to
vast
possessions
and
the
attendant
luxury
are
very
justly
deprived
of
all
the
attributes
of
dignity
and
respect
yet
observe
o
mandarin
how
unbecomingly
this
ingenious
system
of
universal
compensation
has
been
debased
at
the
instance
of
grasping
and
avaricious
ones
dignity
riches
and
ease
now
go
hand
in
hand
and
the
highest
rewarded
in
all
matters
are
also
the
most
esteemed
whereas
if
the
discriminating
provision
of
those
who
have
gone
before
and
so
arranged
it
was
observed
the
direct
contrary
would
be
the
is
a
state
of
things
which
is
somewhat
difficult
to
imagine
in
general
matters
of
life
in
spite
of
the
of
your
words
said
the
mandarin
thoughtfully
can
this
rather
obtuse
and
person
fully
grasp
the
practical
application
of
the
system
on
the
edge
of
the
moment
in
what
manner
would
it
operate
in
the
case
of
ordinary
persons
for
example
should
be
a
fixed
and
settled
arrangement
that
the
and
degrading
occupations
such
as
that
of
following
charitable
persons
from
place
to
place
chanting
verses
composed
in
their
honour
that
of
misleading
travellers
who
inquire
the
way
so
that
they
fall
into
the
hands
of
robbers
and
the
like
callings
should
be
the
most
highly
rewarded
to
the
end
that
those
who
are
engaged
therein
may
obtain
some
solace
for
the
loss
of
dignity
they
experience
and
the
mean
intellectual
position
which
they
are
compelled
to
maintain
by
this
device
they
would
be
enabled
to
possess
certain
advantages
and
degrees
of
comfort
which
at
present
are

how

amiably
conducted

upon
such
a

his
excessively
fatiguing

entirely
unremunerative

distinguished
and
unalterable
mandarin

from
that

apart

regulating
like

turns

handle
of
the
but
does
not
suffer
himself
to
be
drawn
between
the
stones
he
could
still
maintain

the
complete

to
this
wrapped
up
in
thoughts
concerning
the
inception

manner
of

of

project
chan
hung
began
to
retrace
his
steps
towards
the
yamen
failing
to
observe
in
his
benevolent
abstraction
of
mind
that
the
unaffectedly
depraved
person
was
stretching
out
his
feet
towards
him
and
indulging
in
every
other
form
of
and
undignified
contempt
he
reached
the
door
of
his
residence
the
mandarin
overtook
one
who
occupied
a
high
position
of
confidence
and
remuneration
in
the
department
of
public
fireworks
and
coloured
lights
fully
assured
of
this
versatile
enthusiasm
on

of
so
humane
and
charitable
a
device
chan
hung
explained
the
entire
matter
to
him
without
delay
and
expressly
desired
that
if
there
were
any
details
which
appeared
capable
of
improvement
he
would
declare
himself
clearly
regarding
them
exclaimed
the
person
with
whom
the
mandarin
was
conversing
speaking
in
so
unfeignedly
disturbed
and
terrified
a
voice
that
several
who
were
passing
by
stopped
in
order
to
learn
the
full
circumstance
this
ears
been
made
the
object
of
some
unnaturally
pastime
or
does
the
usually
chan
hung
in
reality
contemplate
so
violent
and
an
action
what
but
evil
could
arise
from
a
single
word
of
the
change
which
he
proposes
to
the
extent
of
a
full
written
book
the
entire
fixed
nature
of
events
would
become
reversed
persons
would
no
longer
be
fully
accountable
to
one
another
and
fow
hou
being
thus
thrown
into
a
most
unendurable
state
of
confusion
the
protecting
deities
would
doubtless
withdraw
their
influence
and
the
entire
region
would
soon
be
given
over
to
the
malicious
guardianship
of
rapacious
and
spirits
let
this
person
entreat
the
almost
invariably
chan
hung
to
return
at
once
to
his
adequately
equipped
and
sumptuous
yamen
and
barring
well
the
door
of
his
inner
chamber
so
that
it
can
only
be
opened
from
the
outside
partake
of
several
sleeping
essences
of
unusual
strength
after
which
he
will
awake
in
an
undoubtedly
refreshed
state
of
mind
and
in
a
condition
to
observe
matters
with
his
accustomed
no
means
cried
one
of
those
who
had
stopped
to
learn
the
occasion
of
the
incident
a
very
inferior
maker
of
unserviceable
imitation
pigtails
devout
and
mandarin
chan
hung
speaks
as
the
inspired
of
the
omnipotent
buddha
and
must
for
that
reason
be
obeyed
in
every
detail
this
person
would
unhesitatingly
counsel
the
now
invaluable
mandarin
to
proceed
to
his
residence
without
delay
and
there
calling
together
his
entire
staff
of
those
who
set
down
his
spoken
words
put
the
complete
plan
into
operation
and
beyond
recall
before
he
retires
to
his
inner
this
there
arose
a
most
inelegant
display
of
undignified
emotions
on
the
part
of
the
assembly
which
had
by
this
time
gathered
together
while
those
who
occupied
honourable
and
remunerative
positions
very
earnestly
entreated
the
mandarin
to
act
in
the
manner
which
had
been
suggested
by
the
first
speaker
others
who
had
in
the
meantime
made
use
of
imagined
figures
and
thereby
discovered
that
the
proposed
change
would
be
greatly
to
their
advantage
raised
shouts
of
encouragement
towards
the
proposal
of
the
urging
the
noble
mandarin
not
to
become
small
in
the
face
towards
the
insignificant
few
who
were
ever
opposed
to
enlightened
reform
but
to
maintain
an
unflaccid
upper
lip
and
carry
the
entire
matter
through
to
its
destined
end
in
the
course
of
this
very
unseemly
tumult
which
soon
involved
all
persons
present
in
hostile
demonstrations
towards
each
other
both
the
mandarin
and
the
official
from
the
fireworks
and
coloured
lights
department
found
an
opportunity
to
pass
away
secretly
the
former
to
consider
well
the
various
sides
of
the
matter
towards
which
he
became
better
disposed
with
every
thought
the
latter
to
find
a
purchaser
of
his
appointment
and
leave
fow
hou
before
the
likelihood
of
chan
scheme
became
generally
known
this
point
an
earlier
circumstance
which
affected
the
future
unrolling
of
events
to
no
insignificant
degree
must
be
made
known
concerning
as
it
does
lila
the
fair
and
very
accomplished
daughter
of
chan
hung
possessing
no
son
or
heir
to
succeed
him
the
mandarin
exhibited
towards
lila
a
very
unusual
depth
of
affection
so
marked
indeed
that
when
certain
ones
endeavoured
to
encompass
his
degradation
on
the
plea
of
eccentricity
of
character
the
written
papers
which
they
dispatched
to
the
high
ones
at
peking
contained
no
other
accusation
in
support
of
the
contention
than
that
the
individual
in
question
regarded
his
daughter
with
an
obvious
pride
and
pleasure
which
no
person
of
intellect
lavished
on
any
but
a
son
was
his
really
conscientious
desire
to
establish
welfare
above
all
things
that
had
caused
chan
hung
to
become
in
some
degree
undecided
when
conversing
with
on
the
detail
of
the
scheme
for
unaffected
as
the
mandarin
himself
would
have
been
at
the
prospect
of
an
honourable
poverty
it
was
no
part
of
his
intention
that
the
adorable
and
lila
should
be
drawn
into
such
an
existence
that
indeed
had
been
the
essential
of
his
reply
on
a
certain
and
not
far
removed
occasion
when
two
persons
of
widely
differing
positions
had
each
made
a
formal
request
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
present
gifts
to
the
very
desirable
lila
maintaining
an
enlightened
openness
of
mind
upon
the
subject
the
mandarin
had
replied
that
nothing
but
the
merit
of
undoubted
suitableness
of
a
person
would
affect
him
in
such
a
decision
as
it
was
ordained
by
the
wise
and
unchanging
deities
that
merit
should
always
be
fittingly
rewarded
he
went
on
to
express
himself
and
as
the
most
suitable
person
was
obviously
the
one
who
could
the
most
agreeably
provide
for
her
the
two
circumstances
inevitably
tended
to
the
decision
that
the
one
chosen
should
be
the
person
who
could
amass
the
greatest
number
of
taels
to
this
end
he
instructed
them
both
to
present
themselves
at
the
end
of
a
year
bringing
with
them
the
entire
profits
of
their
undertakings
between
the
two
periods
deliberate
pronouncement
affected
the
two
persons
in
question
in
an
entirely
opposite
manner
for
one
of
them
was
little
removed
from
a
condition
of
incessant
and
most
uninviting
poverty
while
the
other
was
the
very
both
to
this
latter
person
and
to
the
other
one
lee
sing
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
the
matter
did
not
seem
to
be
a
question
of
any
conjecture
therefore
and
in
consequence
the
one
became
most
offensively
and
the
other
to
an
equal
degree
neither
remembering
the
unswerving
wisdom
of
the
proverb
all
men
are
but
as
the
black
beetles
which
overrun
the
inferior
of
the
city
and
even
at
this
moment
the
and
unerring
foot
of
buddha
may
be
sing
was
by
profession
one
of
those
who
hunt
and
ensnare
the
winged
insects
which
are
to
be
found
in
various
parts
of
the
empire
in
great
variety
and
abundance
it
being
his
duty
to
send
a
certain
number
every
year
to
peking
to
contribute
to
the
amusement
of
the
dignified
emperor
in
spite
of
the
not
too
intelligent
nature
of
the
occupation
lee
sing
took
an
honourable
pride
in
all
matters
connected
with
it
he
disdained
with
contempt
to
avail
himself
of
the
stealthy
and
somewhat
deceptive
methods
employed
by
others
engaged
in
a
similar
manner
of
life
in
this
way
he
had
from
necessity
acquired
agility
to
an
exceptional
degree
so
that
he
could
leap
far
into
the
air
and
while
in
that
position
select
from
a
passing
band
of
insects
any
which
he
might
desire
this
useful
accomplishment
was
in
a
measure
the
direct
means
of
bringing
together
the
person
in
question
and
the
engaging
lila
for
on
a
certain
occasion
when
lee
sing
was
passing
through
the
streets
of
fow
hou
he
heard
a
great
outcry
and
beheld
persons
of
all
ranks
running
towards
him
pointing
at
the
same
time
in
an
upward
direction
turning
his
gaze
in
the
manner
indicated
lee
beheld
with
every
variety
of
astonishment
a
powerful
and
unnaturally
large
bird
of
prey
carrying
in
its
talons
the
lovely
and
now
insensible
lila
to
whom
it
had
been
attracted
by
the
magnificence
of
her
raiment
the
rapacious
and
creature
was
already
above
the
highest
when
lee
first
beheld
it
and
was
plainly
directing
its
course
towards
the
inaccessible
mountain
crags
beyond
the
city
walls
nevertheless
lee
resolved
upon
an
inspired
effort
and
without
any
hesitation
bounded
towards
it
with
such
proficiency
that
if
he
had
not
stretched
forth
his
hand
on
passing
he
would
inevitably
have
been
carried
far
above
the
desired
object
in
this
manner
he
succeeded
in
dragging
the
repulsive
and
completely
disconcerted
monster
to
the
ground
where
its
graceful
and
unassuming
prisoner
was
released
and
the
presumptuous
bird
itself
torn
to
pieces
amid
continuous
shouts
of
a
most
respectful
and
engaging
description
in
honour
of
lee
and
of
his
versatile
attainment
consequence
of
this
incident
the
grateful
lila
would
often
deliberately
leave
the
society
of
the
rich
and
in
order
to
accompany
lee
on
his
journeys
in
pursuit
of
winged
insects
regarding
his
unusual
ability
as
the
undoubted
cause
of
her
existence
at
that
moment
she
took
an
pride
in
such
displays
and
would
utter
loud
and
frequent
exclamations
of
triumph
when
lee
leaped
out
from
behind
some
rock
where
he
had
lain
concealed
and
with
unfailing
regularity
secured
the
object
of
his
adroit
movement
in
this
manner
a
state
of
feeling
which
was
by
no
means
favourable
to
the
aspiring
had
long
existed
between
the
two
persons
but
when
lee
sing
put
the
matter
in
the
form
of
an
explicit
petition
before
chan
hung
to
which
adequate
reference
has
already
been
made
the
nature
of
the
decision
then
arrived
at
seemed
to
clothe
the
realization
of
their
virtuous
and
estimable
desires
with
an
air
of
extreme
improbability
lee
exclaimed
the
maiden
when
her
lover
had
explained
to
her
the
nature
of
the
arrangement
for
in
her
unassuming
admiration
of
the
noble
qualities
of
lee
she
had
anticipated
that
chan
hung
would
at
once
have
received
him
with
ceremonious
embraces
and
assurances
of
his
permanent
affection
unendurable
a
state
of
things
is
this
in
which
we
have
become
involved
far
removed
from
this
anticipations
was
the
thought
of
becoming
inalienably
associated
with
that
outrageous
person
or
of
entering
upon
an
existence
which
will
necessitate
a
feigned
admiration
of
his
really
unpresentable
efforts
yet
in
such
a
manner
must
the
entire
circumstance
complete
its
course
unless
some
ingenious
method
of
evading
it
can
be
discovered
in
the
meantime
alas
my
beloved
one
the
occupation
of
ensnaring
winged
insects
is
indeed
an
alluring
one
but
as
far
as
this
person
has
observed
it
is
also
exceedingly
unproductive
of
taels
could
not
some
more
expeditious
means
of
enriching
yourself
be
discovered
frequently
has
the
unnoticed
but
nevertheless
very
attentive
lila
heard
her
father
and
the
ones
who
visit
him
speak
of
exploits
which
seem
to
consist
of
assuming
the
shapes
of
certain
wild
animals
and
in
that
guise
appearing
from
time
to
time
at
the
place
of
exchange
within
the
city
walls
as
this
form
of
entertainment
is
undoubtedly
very
remunerative
in
its
results
could
not
the
versatile
and
lee
conceal
himself
within
the
skin
of
a
bear
or
some
other
untamed
beast
and
in
this
garb
joining
them
unperceived
play
an
appointed
part
and
receive
a
just
share
of
the
reward
result
of
such
an
enterprise
might
if
the
matter
chanced
to
take
an
unforeseen
development
prove
of
a
very
doubtful
nature
replied
lee
sing
to
whom
indeed
the
proposed
venture
appeared
in
a
somewhat
undignified
light
although
with
refined
consideration
he
withheld
such
a
thought
from
lila
who
had
proposed
it
for
him
and
also
confessed
that
her
usually
immaculate
father
had
taken
part
in
such
an
exhibition
do
not
permit
the
dark
shadow
of
an
inward
cloud
to
reflect
itself
upon
your
almost
invariably
amiable
countenance
for
this
person
has
become
possessed
of
a
valuable
internal
suggestion
which
although
he
has
hitherto
neglected
being
content
with
a
small
but
assured
competency
would
doubtless
bring
together
a
serviceable
number
of
taels
if
rightly
does
this
person
fear
that
the
valuable
internal
suggestion
of
lee
sing
will
weigh
but
lightly
in
the
commercial
balance
against
the
very
rapidly
executed
pictures
of
said
lila
who
had
not
fully
recalled
from
her
mind
a
disturbing
emotion
that
lee
would
have
been
well
advised
to
have
availed
himself
of
her
ingenious
and
suggestion
of
what
does
the
matter
consist
is
the
best
explained
by
a
recital
of
the
circumstances
leading
up
to
it
said
lee
an
occasion
when
this
person
was
passing
through
the
streets
of
fow
hou
there
gathered
around
him
a
company
of
those
who
had
on
previous
occasions
beheld
his
exceptional
powers
of
hurtling
himself
through
the
air
in
an
upward
direction
praying
that
he
would
again
delight
their
senses
by
a
similar
spectacle
not
being
unwilling
to
afford
those
estimable
persons
of
the
amusement
they
desired
this
one
without
any
elaborate
show
of
affected
hesitancy
put
himself
into
the
necessary
position
and
would
without
doubt
have
risen
uninterruptedly
almost
into
the
middle
air
had
he
not
in
making
the
preparatory
movements
placed
his
left
foot
upon
an
wampee
which
lay
unperceived
on
the
ground
in
consequence
of
this
really
blameworthy
want
of
caution
the
entire
manner
and
direction
of
this
movements
underwent
a
sudden
and
complete
change
so
that
to
those
who
stood
around
it
appeared
as
though
he
were
making
a
endeavour
to
penetrate
through
the
upper
surface
of
the
earth
this
unexpected
display
had
the
effect
of
removing
the
gravity
of
even
the
most
aged
and
persons
present
and
for
the
space
of
some
moments
the
behaviour
and
positions
of
those
who
stood
around
were
such
that
they
were
quite
unable
to
render
any
assistance
greatly
as
they
doubtless
wished
to
do
so
being
in
this
manner
allowed
a
period
for
inward
reflexion
of
a
very
concentrated
order
it
arose
within
this
mind
that
at
every
similar
occurrence
which
he
had
witnessed
those
who
observed
the
event
had
been
seized
in
a
like
fashion
being
very
excessively
amused
the
fact
was
made
even
more
undoubted
by
the
manner
of
behaving
of
an
exceedingly
stout
and
person
who
had
not
been
present
from
the
beginning
but
who
was
affected
to
a
most
incredible
extent
when
the
details
as
they
had
occurred
were
made
plain
to
him
he
declaring
with
many
references
to
the
sacred
dragon
and
the
seven
walled
temple
at
peking
that
he
would
willingly
have
contributed
a
specified
number
of
taels
rather
than
have
missed
the
diversion
when
at
length
this
person
reached
his
own
chamber
he
diligently
applied
himself
to
the
task
of
carrying
into
practical
effect
the
suggestion
which
had
arisen
in
his
mind
by
an
arrangement
of
transparent
glasses
and
reflecting
surfaces
which
were
it
not
for
a
natural
modesty
he
would
certainly
be
tempted
to
describe
as
highly
ingenious
he
ultimately
succeeded
in
bringing
about
the
effect
he
these
words
lee
put
into
hands
an
object
which
closely
resembled
the
contrivances
by
which
those
who
are
not
sufficiently
powerful
to
obtain
positions
near
the
raised
platform
in
the
halls
of
celestial
harmony
are
nevertheless
enabled
to
observe
the
complexions
and
attire
of
all
around
them
regulating
it
by
means
of
a
hidden
spring
he
requested
her
to
follow
closely
the
actions
of
a
passerby
who
was
at
that
moment
some
little
distance
beyond
them
scarcely
had
lila
raised
the
glass
to
her
eyes
than
she
became
irresistibly
amused
to
a
most
infectious
degree
greatly
to
the
satisfaction
of
lee
who
therein
beheld
the
realization
of
his
hopes
not
for
the
briefest
space
of
time
would
she
permit
the
object
to
pass
from
her
but
directed
it
at
every
person
who
came
within
her
sight
with
frequent
and
unfeigned
exclamations
of
wonder
and
delight
pleasant
and
fascinating
a
device
is
this
exclaimed
lila
at
length
what
means
is
so
diverting
and
a
result
obtained
than
that
it
is
the
concentration
of
much
labour
of
continually
trying
with
glasses
and
reflecting
surfaces
this
person
is
totally
unable
to
explain
it
replied
lee
chief
thing
however
is
that
at
whatever
moving
object
it
is
directed
no
matter
whether
a
person
so
observed
is
being
carried
in
a
chair
riding
upon
an
animal
or
merely
walking
at
a
certain
point
he
has
every
appearance
of
being
unexpectedly
hurled
to
the
ground
in
a
most
violent
and
manner
would
not
the
stout
and
one
who
would
cheerfully
have
contributed
a
certain
number
of
taels
to
see
this
person
manifest
a
similar
exhibition
unhesitatingly
lay
out
that
sum
to
secure
the
means
of
so
gratifying
his
emotions
whenever
he
felt
the
desire
even
with
the
revered
persons
of
the
most
dignified
ones
in
the
empire
is
there
indeed
a
single
person
between
the
wall
and
the
bitter
waters
on
the
south
who
is
so
devoid
of
ambition
that
he
would
miss
the
opportunity
of
subjecting
as
it
were
perhaps
even
the
sacred
emperor
himself
to
the
exceptional
feat
temptation
to
possess
one
would
inevitably
prove
overwhelming
to
any
person
of
ordinary
intelligence
admitted
lila
in
spite
of
this
unassumed
admiration
for
the
contrivance
internal
doubts
regarding
the
ultimate
happiness
of
the
two
persons
who
are
now
discussing
the
matter
again
attack
her
she
recollects
somewhat
dimly
an
almost
forgotten
but
nevertheless
very
unassailable
proverb
which
declares
that
more
contentment
of
mind
can
assuredly
be
obtained
from
the
unexpected
discovery
of
a
tael
among
the
folds
of
a
discarded
garment
than
could
in
the
most
favourable
circumstances
ensue
from
the
construction
of
a
new
and
hitherto
unknown
device
furthermore
although
the
span
of
a
year
may
seem
unaccountably
protracted
when
persons
who
reciprocate
engaging
sentiments
are
parted
yet
when
the
acceptance
or
refusal
of
undesirable
hangs
upon
the
accomplishment
of
a
remote
and
not
very
probable
object
within
that
period
it
becomes
as
a
breath
of
wind
passing
through
an
autumn
the
day
when
lila
and
lee
had
sat
together
side
by
side
and
conversed
in
this
unrestrained
and
irreproachable
manner
the
great
had
many
times
been
obscured
for
a
period
only
an
insignificant
portion
of
the
year
remained
yet
the
affairs
of
lee
sing
were
in
no
more
prosperous
a
condition
than
before
nor
had
he
found
an
opportunity
to
set
aside
any
store
of
taels
each
day
the
unsupportable
became
more
and
more
obtrusive
and
even
to
the
extent
of
throwing
far
into
the
air
coins
of
insignificant
value
whenever
he
chanced
to
pass
lee
in
the
street
at
the
same
time
urging
him
to
leap
after
them
and
thereby
secure
at
least
one
or
two
pieces
of
money
against
the
day
of
calculating
in
a
similar
but
entirely
opposite
fashion
lila
and
lee
experienced
the
acutest
pangs
of
an
despair
until
their
only
form
of
greeting
consisted
in
gazing
into
each
eyes
with
a
expression
of
at
this
very
time
when
even
the
natural
and
unalterable
powers
seemed
to
be
conspiring
against
the
success
of
modest
and
inoffensive
hopes
an
event
was
taking
place
which
was
shortly
to
reverse
the
entire
settled
arrangement
of
persons
and
affairs
and
involved
fow
hou
in
a
very
inextricable
state
of
uncertainty
for
not
to
make
a
pretence
of
concealing
a
matter
which
has
been
already
in
part
revealed
the
mandarin
chan
hung
had
by
this
time
determined
to
act
in
the
manner
which
had
suggested
so
that
on
a
certain
morning
lee
sing
was
visited
by
two
persons
bearing
between
them
a
very
weighty
sack
of
taels
who
also
conveyed
to
him
the
fact
that
a
like
amount
would
be
deposited
within
his
door
at
the
end
of
each
succeeding
seven
days
although
occupation
had
in
the
past
been
very
meagrely
rewarded
either
by
taels
or
by
honour
the
circumstance
which
resulted
in
his
now
receiving
so
excessively
large
a
sum
is
not
made
clear
until
the
detail
of
scheme
is
closely
examined
the
matter
then
becomes
plain
for
it
had
been
suggested
by
that
person
that
the
most
proficient
in
any
occupation
should
be
rewarded
to
a
certain
extent
and
the
least
proficient
to
another
stated
extent
the
original
amounts
being
reversed
when
those
engaged
by
chang
hung
to
draw
up
the
various
rates
came
to
the
profession
of
ensnaring
winged
insects
however
they
discovered
that
lee
sing
was
the
only
one
of
that
description
in
fow
hou
so
that
it
became
necessary
in
consequence
to
allot
him
a
double
portion
one
amount
as
the
most
proficient
and
a
much
larger
amount
as
the
least
proficient
is
unnecessary
now
to
follow
the
not
altogether
satisfactory
condition
of
affairs
which
began
to
exist
in
fow
hou
as
soon
as
the
scheme
was
put
into
operation
the
full
written
papers
dealing
with
the
matter
are
in
the
hall
of
public
reference
at
peking
and
can
be
seen
by
any
person
on
the
payment
of
a
few
taels
to
everyone
connected
with
the
establishment
those
who
found
their
possessions
reduced
thereby
completely
overlooked
the
obvious
justice
of
the
arrangement
and
immediately
began
to
take
most
severe
measures
to
have
the
order
put
aside
while
those
who
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
found
themselves
raised
to
positions
of
affluence
tended
to
the
same
end
by
conducting
themselves
in
a
most
incapable
and
undiscriminating
manner
and
during
the
entire
period
that
this
state
of
things
existed
in
fow
hou
the
really
contemptible
continually
followed
chan
hung
about
from
place
to
place
spreading
out
his
feet
towards
him
and
allowing
himself
to
become
openly
amused
to
a
most
unseemly
extent
among
those
who
sought
to
have
the
original
manner
of
rewarding
persons
again
established
was
the
who
now
found
himself
in
a
condition
of
most
abject
poverty
so
unbearable
indeed
that
he
frequently
went
by
night
carrying
a
lantern
in
the
hope
that
he
might
discover
some
of
the
small
pieces
of
money
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
throw
into
the
air
on
meeting
lee
sing
to
his
pangs
of
hunger
was
added
the
fear
that
he
would
certainly
lose
lila
so
that
from
day
to
day
he
redoubled
his
efforts
and
in
the
end
by
using
false
statements
and
other
artifices
of
a
questionable
nature
the
party
which
he
led
was
successful
in
obtaining
the
degradation
of
chan
hung
and
his
dismissal
from
office
together
with
an
entire
reversal
of
all
his
plans
and
enactments
the
last
day
of
the
year
which
chan
hung
had
appointed
as
the
period
of
test
for
his
suitors
the
person
in
question
was
seated
in
a
chamber
of
his
new
abode
a
residence
of
unassuming
appearance
but
undoubted
comfort
surrounded
by
lila
and
lee
when
the
hanging
curtains
were
suddenly
flung
aside
and
followed
by
two
persons
of
low
rank
bearing
sacks
of
money
appeared
among
them
hung
he
said
at
length
the
past
events
arose
which
compelled
this
person
to
place
himself
against
you
in
your
official
position
nevertheless
he
has
always
maintained
towards
you
personally
an
unchanging
affection
and
understanding
full
well
that
you
are
one
of
those
who
maintain
their
spoken
word
in
spite
of
all
happenings
he
has
now
come
to
exhibit
the
taels
which
he
has
collected
together
and
to
claim
the
fulfilment
of
your
deliberate
these
words
the
commonplace
poured
forth
the
contents
of
the
sacks
and
stood
looking
at
lila
in
a
most
confident
and
unprepossessing
manner
replied
chan
hung
rising
from
his
couch
and
speaking
in
so
severe
and
impressive
a
voice
that
the
two
servants
of
at
once
fled
in
great
apprehension
person
has
also
found
it
necessary
in
his
official
position
to
oppose
you
but
here
the
similarity
ends
for
on
his
part
he
has
never
felt
towards
you
the
remotest
degree
of
affection
nevertheless
he
is
always
desirous
as
you
say
that
persons
should
regard
their
spoken
word
and
as
you
seem
to
hold
a
promise
from
the
chief
mandarin
of
fow
hou
regarding
towards
his
daughter
he
would
advise
you
to
go
at
once
to
that
person
a
misunderstanding
has
evidently
arisen
for
the
one
whom
you
are
addressing
is
merely
chan
hung
and
the
words
spoken
by
the
mandarin
have
no
sort
of
interest
for
him
indeed
he
understands
that
all
that
acts
have
been
reversed
so
that
he
fails
to
see
how
anyone
at
all
can
regard
you
and
your
claim
in
other
than
a
light
furthermore
the
maiden
in
question
is
now
definitely
and
irretrievably
pledged
to
this
faithful
and
successful
one
by
my
side
who
as
you
will
doubtless
be
gracefully
overjoyed
to
learn
has
recently
disposed
of
a
most
ingenious
and
diverting
contrivance
for
an
enormous
number
of
taels
so
many
indeed
that
both
the
immediate
and
the
future
of
all
the
persons
who
are
here
before
you
are
now
in
no
sort
of
doubt
these
words
the
three
persons
whom
he
had
interrupted
again
turned
their
attention
to
the
matter
before
them
but
as
walked
away
he
observed
though
he
failed
to
understand
the
meaning
that
they
all
raised
certain
objects
to
their
eyes
and
at
once
became
amused
to
a
most
striking
and
uncontrollable
the
confession
of
kai
lung
related
by
himself
at
when
other
matter
failed
him

unrolled
his
mat
and
selected
with
grave
deliberation
the
spot
under
the
which
would
the
longest
remain
sheltered
from
the
rays
his
impassive
eye
wandered
round
the
thin
circle
of
listeners
who
had
been
drawn
together
by
his
uplifted
voice
with
a
glance
which
had
it
expressed
his
actual
thoughts
would
have
betrayed
a
keen
desire
that
the
assembly
should
be
composed
of
strangers
rather
than
of
his
most
consistent
patrons
to
whom
his
stock
of
tales
was
indeed
becoming
embarrassingly
familiar
nevertheless
when
he
began
there
was
nothing
in
his
voice
but
a
trace
of
insufficiently
restrained
triumph
such
as
might
be
fitly
assumed
by
one
who
has
discovered
and
makes
known
for
the
first

broken
by
a
very
aged
man
who
arose
from
among
the
bystanders

length
of
this
pigtail

exclaimed

of
his
moustaches
and
the
venerable
appearance
of
his
beard
there
is
no
more
aged
person
present
if
indeed
there
be
such
a
one
in
all
the
province
it
accordingly
devolves
upon
him
to
speak
in
this
matter
which
shall
be
as
follows
the
and
proficient
kai
lung
shall
relate
the
story
as
he
has
proposed
and
the
garrulous
wang

shall
twice
contribute
to
kai
bowl
when
it
is
passed
round
once
for
himself
and
once
for
this
person
in
order
that
he
may
learn
either
to
be
more
discreet
or
more
proficient
in
the
art
of
aptly
events
which
it
is
this
presumptuous
intention
to
describe
to
this
and
providentially
indulgent
gathering
began
kai
lung
when
his
audience
had
become
settled
and
the
wooden
bowl
had
passed
to
and
fro
among
them
not
occupy
many
years
although
they
were
of
a
nature
which
made
them
of
far
more
importance
than
all
the
remainder
of
his
existence
thereby
supporting
the
sage
discernment
of
the
philosopher
who
first
made
the
observation
that
man
is
greatly
inferior
to
the
meanest
fly
inasmuch
as
that
creature
although
granted
only
a
span
of
life
contrives
during
that
period
to
fulfil
all
the
allotted
functions
of
existence
to
the
astonishment
and
dismay
of
this
person
and
all
those
connected
with
him
for
several
of
the
most
expensive
readers
of
the
future
to
be
found
in
the
empire
had
declared
that
his
life
would
be
marked
by
great
events
his
career
a
source
of
continual
wonder
and
his
death
a
misfortune
to
those
who
had
dealings
with
him
his
efforts
to
take
a
degree
at
the
public
literary
competitions
were
not
attended
with
any
adequate
success
in
view
of
the
plainly
expressed
advice
of
his
father
it
therefore
became
desirable
that
this
person
should
turn
his
attention
to
some
other
method
of
regaining
the
esteem
of
those
upon
whom
he
was
dependent
for
all
the
necessaries
of
existence
not
having
the
means
wherewith
to
engage
in
any
form
of
commerce
and
being
entirely
ignorant
of
all
matters
save
the
now
useless
details
of
attempting
to
pass
public
examinations
he
reluctantly
decided
that
he
was
destined
to
become
one
of
those
who
imagine
and
write
out
stories
and
similar
devices
for
printed
leaves
and
books
determination
was
favourably
received
and
upon
learning
it
this
dignified
father
took
him
aside
and
with
many
assurances
of
regard
presented
to
him
a
written
sentence
which
he
said
would
be
of
incomparable
value
to
one
engaged
in
a
literary
career
and
should
in
fact
without
any
particular
qualifications
insure
an
honourable
competency
he
himself
he
added
with
what
at
the
time
appeared
to
this
one
as
an
unnecessary
regard
for
detail
having
taken
a
very
high
degree
and
being
in
consequence
appointed
to
a
distinguished
and
remunerative
position
under
the
board
of
fines
and
tortures
had
never
made
any
use
of
it
written
sentence
indeed
was
all
that
it
had
been
pronounced
it
had
been
composed
by
a
remote
ancestor
who
had
spent
his
entire
life
in
crystallizing
all
his
knowledge
and
experience
into
a
few
written
lines
which
as
a
result
became
correspondingly
precious
it
defined
in
a
very
original
and
profound
manner
several
undisputable
principles
and
was
so
engagingly
subtle
in
its
manner
of
expression
that
the
most
superficial
person
was
irresistibly
thrown
into
a
deep
inward
contemplation
upon
reading
it
when
it
was
complete
the
person
who
had
contrived
this
ingenious
masterpiece
discovering
by
means
of
omens
that
he
still
had
ten
years
to
live
devoted
each
remaining
year
to
the
task
of
reducing
the
sentence
by
one
word
without
in
any
way
altering
its
meaning
this
unapproachable
example
of
conciseness
found
such
favour
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
issue
printed
leaves
that
as
fast
as
this
person
could
inscribe
stories
containing
it
they
were
eagerly
purchased
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
very
incapable
want
of
foresight
on
this
part
doubtless
it
would
still
be
affording
him
an
agreeable
and
permanent
means
of
living
the
enlightened
was
well
acquainted
with
the
subject
when
he
exclaimed
a
frugal
dish
of
olives
flavoured
with
honey
than
the
most
sumptuously
devised
of
which
the
greater
portion
is
sent
forth
in
boxes
and
partaken
of
by
at
that
time
however
this
versatile
saying
which
so
gracefully
conveys
the
truth
of
the
undeniable
fact
that
what
a
person
possesses
is
sufficient
if
he
restrain
his
mind
from
desiring
aught
else
would
have
been
lightly
treated
by
this
even
if
his
immature
faculties
had
enabled
him
fully
to
understand
the
import
of
so
profound
and
a
remark
that
time
tiao
was
undoubtedly
the
most
beautiful
maiden
in
all
peking
so
frequently
were
the
verses
describing
her
habits
and
appearances
affixed
in
the
most
prominent
places
of
the
city
that
many
persons
obtained
an
honourable
livelihood
by
frequenting
those
spots
and
disposing
of
the
sacks
of
written
papers
which
they
collected
to
merchants
who
engaged
in
that
commerce
owing
to
the
fame
attained
by
his
written
sentence
this
really
very
much
inferior
being
had
many
opportunities
of
meeting
the
incomparable
maiden
tiao
at
assemblies
and
those
gatherings
where
persons
of
both
sexes
exhibit
themselves
in
revolving
attitudes
and
are
permitted
to
embrace
openly
without
reproach
whereupon
he
became
so
subservient
to
her
charms
and
virtues
that
he
lost
no
opportunity
of
making
himself
utterly
unendurable
to
any
who
might
chance
to
speak
to
or
even
gaze
upon
this
creature
successful
was
this
person
in
his
endeavour
to
meet
the
sublime
tiao
and
to
gain
her
conscientious
esteem
that
all
emotions
of
prudence
forsook
him
or
it
would
soon
have
become
apparent
even
to
his
enfeebled
understanding
that
such
consistent
good
fortune
could
only
be
the
work
of
unforgiving
and
malignant
spirits
whose
he
had
in
some
way
earned
and
who
were
luring
him
on
in
order
that
they
might
accomplish
his
destruction
that
object
was
achieved
on
a
certain
evening
when
this
person
stood
alone
with
tiao
upon
an
eminence
overlooking
the
city
and
watched
the
great
rise
from
behind
the
hills
under
these
delicate
and
ennobling
influences
he
gave
speech
to
many
very
ornamental
and
refined
thoughts
which
arose
within
his
mind
concerning
the
graceful
brilliance
of
the
light
which
was
cast
all
around
yet
notwithstanding
which
a
still
more
exceptional
and
brilliant
light
was
shining
in
his
own
internal
organs
by
reason
of
the
nearness
of
an
even
purer
and
more
engaging
orb
there
was
no
need
this
person
felt
to
hide
even
his
most
inside
thoughts
from
the
dignified
and
sympathetic
being
at
his
side
so
without
hesitation
he
spoke
in
what
he
believes
even
now
must
have
been
a
very
decorative
manner
of
the
many
thousand
persons
who
were
then
wrapped
in
sleep
of
the
constantly
changing
lights
which
appeared
in
the
city
beneath
and
of
the
vastness
which
everywhere
lay
around
kai
lung
exclaimed
the
lovely
tiao
when
this
person
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
expertly
and
in
what
a
proficient
manner
do
you
express
yourself
uttering
even
the
sentiments
which
this
person
has
felt
inwardly
but
for
which
she
has
no
words
why
indeed
do
you
not
inscribe
them
in
a
book
her
elevating
influence
it
had
already
occurred
to
this
illiterate
individual
that
it
would
be
a
more
dignified
and
perhaps
even
a
more
profitable
course
for
him
to
write
out
and
dispose
of
to
those
who
print
such
matters
the
versatile
and
expressions
which
now
continually
formed
his
thoughts
rather
than
be
dependent
upon
the
concise
sentence
for
which
indeed
he
was
indebted
to
the
wisdom
of
a
remote
ancestor
spoken
word
fully
settled
his
determination
so
that
without
delay
he
set
himself
to
the
task
of
composing
a
story
which
should
omit
the
usual
sentence
but
should
contain
instead
a
large
number
of
his
most
graceful
and
thoughts
so
engrossed
did
this
and
superficial
person
become
in
the
task
which
daily
seemed
to
increase
rather
than
lessen
as
new
and
still
more
sublime
images
arose
within
his
mind
that
many
months
passed
before
the
matter
was
complete
in
the
end
instead
of
a
story
it
had
assumed
the
proportions
of
an
important
and
book
while
tiao
had
in
the
meantime
accepted
the
wedding
gifts
of
an
objectionable
and
excessively
individual
who
had
amassed
an
inconceivable
number
of
taels
by
inducing
persons
to
take
part
in
what
at
first
sight
appeared
to
be
an
ingenious
but
very
easy
competition
connected
with
the
order
in
which
certain
horses
should
arrive
at
a
given
and
clearly
defined
spot
by
that
time
however
this
unduly
sanguine
had
become
completely
entranced
in
his
work
and
merely
regarded
as
a
but
no
longer
necessary
incentive
to
his
success
with
every
hope
therefore
he
went
forth
to
dispose
of
his
written
leaves
confident
of
finding
some
very
wealthy
person
who
would
be
in
a
condition
to
pay
him
the
correct
value
of
the
work
the
end
of
two
years
this
somewhat
disillusionized
but
still
undaunted
person
chanced
to
hear
of
a
benevolent
and
unassuming
body
of
men
who
made
a
habit
of
issuing
works
in
which
they
discerned
merit
but
which
nevertheless
others
were
unanimous
in
describing
as
no
here
this
person
was
received
with
gracious
effusion
and
being
in
a
position
to
impress
those
with
whom
he
was
dealing
with
his
undoubted
knowledge
of
the
subject
he
finally
succeeded
in
making
a
very
advantageous
arrangement
by
which
he
was
to
pay
of
the
number
of
taels
expended
in
producing
the
work
and
to
receive
in
return
all
the
profits
which
should
result
from
the
undertaking
those
who
were
concerned
in
the
matter
were
so
engagingly
impressed
with
the
incomparable
literary
merit
displayed
in
the
production
that
they
counselled
a
great
number
of
copies
being
made
ready
in
order
as
they
said
that
this
person
should
not
lose
by
there
being
any
delay
when
once
the
accomplishment
became
the
one
topic
of
conversation
in
and
yamens
from
this
cause
it
came
about
that
the
matter
of
taels
to
be
expended
was
much
greater
than
had
been
anticipated
at
the
beginning
so
that
when
the
day
arrived
on
which
the
volumes
were
to
be
sent
forth
this
person
found
that
almost
his
last
piece
of
money
had
disappeared
how
small
a
share
has
a
person
in
the
work
of
controlling
his
own
destiny
had
only
the
necessarily
penurious
and
now
almost
degraded
kai
lung
been
born
a
brief
span
before
the
great
writer
lo
kuan
chang
his
name
would
have
been
received
with
every
mark
of
esteem
from
one
end
of
the
empire
to
the
other
while
taels
and
honourable
decorations
would
have
been
showered
upon
him
for
the
truth
which
could
no
longer
be
concealed
revealed
the
fact
that
this
inopportune
individual
possessed
a
mind
framed
in
such
a
manner
that
his
thoughts
had
already
been
the
thoughts
of
the
inspired
lo
kuan
who
as
this
person
would
not
be
so
presumptuous
as
to
inform
this
ornamental
and
gathering
was
the
most
ingenious
and
composer
of
written
words
that
this
empire
and
therefore
the
entire
world
has
seen
as
indeed
his
honourable
title
of
mandarin
duck
of
the
plainly
indicates
this
person
had
frequently
been
greatly
surprised
himself
during
the
writing
of
his
long
work
by
the
brilliance
and
manysidedness
of
the
thoughts
and
metaphors
which
arose
in
his
mind
without
conscious
effort
it
was
not
until
the
appearance
of
the
printed
leaves
which
make
a
custom
of
warning
persons
against
being
persuaded
into
buying
certain
books
that
he
definitely
understood
how
all
these
things
had
been
fully
expressed
many
dynasties
ago
by
the
lo
kuan
chang
and
formed
indeed
the
great
national
standard
of
unapproachable
excellence
unfortunately
this
person
had
been
so
deeply
engrossed
all
his
life
in
literary
pursuits
that
he
had
never
found
an
opportunity
to
glance
at
the
works
in
question
or
he
would
have
escaped
the
embarrassing
position
in
which
he
now
found
himself
was
with
a
hopeless
sense
of
illness
of
ease
that
this
unhappy
one
reached
the
day
on
which
the
printed
leaves
already
alluded
to
would
make
known
their
deliberate
opinion
of
his
writing
the
extremity
of
his
hope
being
that
some
would
at
least
credit
him
with
honourable
motives
and
perhaps
a
knowledge
that
if
the
inspired
lo
kuan
chan
had
never
been
born
the
entire
matter
might
have
been
brought
to
a
very
different
conclusion
alas
only
one
among
the
many
printed
leaves
which
made
reference
to
the
venture
contained
any
words
of
friendship
or
encouragement
this
benevolent
exception
was
sent
forth
from
a
city
in
the
extreme
northern
province
of
the
empire
and
contained
many
inspiring
though
delicately
guarded
messages
of
hope
for
the
one
to
whom
they
gracefully
alluded
as
undoubtedly
youthful
but
nevertheless
distinctly
promising
writer
of
while
admitting
that
altogether
they
found
the
production
undeniably
tedious
they
claimed
to
have
discovered
indications
of
an
obvious
talent
and
therefore
they
unhesitatingly
counselled
the
person
in
question
to
take
courage
at
the
prospect
of
a
moderate
competency
which
was
certainly
within
his
grasp
if
he
restrained
his
somewhat
impulses
and
closely
observed
the
simple

they
then
set
forth
although
it
became
plain
that
the
writer
of
this
amiably
devised
notice
was
like
this
incapable
person
entirely
unacquainted
with
the
masterpieces
of
lo

yet
the
indisputable
fact
remained
that
entirely
on
its
merit
the
work
had
been
greeted
with
undoubted
enthusiasm
so
that
after
purchasing
many
examples
of
the
refined
printed
leaf
containing
it
this
person
sat
far
into
the
night
continually
reading
over
the
one
unprejudiced
and
discriminating
expression
the
other
printed
leaves
displayed
a
complete
absence
of
good
taste
in
dealing
with
the
matter
one
boldly
asserted
that
the
entire
circumstance
was
the
outcome
of
a
foolish
jest
or
wager
on
the
part
of
a
person
who
possessed
a
million
taels
another
predicted
that
it
was
a
cunning
and
elaborately
method
of
obtaining
the
attention
of
the
people
on
the
part
of
certain
persons
who
claimed
to
vend
a
reliable
and
cleansing
substance
the
of
hoang
rose
leaves
and
hoped
in
a
spirit
of
no
sincerity
that
the
ingenious
kai
lung
would
not
rest
on
his
but
would
soon
send
forth
an
equally
entertaining
amended
example
of
the
of
and
other
sacred
works
while
the
essence
of
the

merely
printed

portions
from
the
two
books
under
the
large

there
really
any
need
for
us
to
express
ourselves
more
clearly
disappointment
both
as
regards
public
esteem
and
taels
for
after
the
manner
in
which
the
work
had
been
received
by
those
who
advise
on
such
productions
not
a
single
example
was
purchased
threw
this
individual
into
a
condition
of
most
unendurable
depression
from
which
he
was
only
aroused
by
a
remarkable
example
of
the
unfailing
wisdom
of
the
proverb
which
says
hastening
to
secure
a
possible
reward
of
five
taels
by
dragging
an
unobservant
person
away
from
a
falling
building
examine
well
his
features
lest
you
find
when
too
late
that
it
is
one
to
whom
you
are
indebted
for
double
that
disappointed
in
the
hope
of
securing
large
gains
from
the
sale
of
his
great
work
this
person
now
turned
his
attention
again
to
his
former
means
of
living
only
to
find
however
that
the
discredit
in
which
he
had
become
involved
even
attached
itself
to
his
concise
sentence
for
in
place
of
the
remunerative
and
honourable
manner
in
which
it
was
formerly
received
it
was
now
regarded
on
all
hands
with
open
suspicion
instead
of
meekly
to
an
evidently
doom
the
last
misfortune
aroused
this
usually
resigned
to
an
ungovernable
frenzy
regarding
the
accomplished
but
at
the
same
time
exceedingly
lo
kuan
chang
as
the
beginning
of
all
his
evils
he
took
a
solemn
oath
as
a
mark
of
disapproval
that
he
had
not
been
content
to
inscribe
on
paper
only
half
of
his
brilliant
thoughts
leaving
the
other
half
for
the
benefit
of
this
and
equally
individual
in
which
case
there
would
have
been
a
sufficiency
of
taels
and
of
fame
for
both
a
very
considerable
space
of
time
this
person
could
conceive
no
method
by
which
he
might
attain
his
object
at
length
however
as
a
result
of
very
keen
and
subtle
intellectual
searching
and
many
sacrifices
it
was
conveyed
by
means
of
a
dream
that
one
very
ingenious
yet
simple
way
was
possible
the
renowned
and
writings
of
the
distinguished
lo
kuan
for
the
most
part
take
their
action
within
a
few
dynasties
of
their
own
time
all
that
remained
for
this
inventive
person
to
accomplish
therefore
was
to
trace
out
the
entire
matter
making
the
words
and
speeches
to
proceed
from
the
mouths
of
those
who
existed
in
still
earlier
periods
by
this
crafty
method
it
would
at
once
appear
as
though
the
lo
kuan
had
been
indebted
to
one
who
came
before
him
for
all
his
most
subtle
thoughts
and
in
consequence
his
tomb
would
become
dishonoured
and
his
memory
execrated
without
any
delay
this
person
cheerfully
set
himself
to
the
somewhat
laborious
task
before
him
lo
exclamation
of
the
emperor

the
battlefield
of
a

unhesitatingly

entire

attributed
to
an
emperor

thousand
years
before

treacherous
and
unpopular

no
less
frequently
quoted
portion

nobly
intentioned
but
nevertheless
exceedingly
morose
the
object
before
you
is
your
distinguished
and
demon
the
change
of
a

effecting
whatever
alteration
was
necessary
while
the

beginning
person
who
becomes
amused
at
matters
resulting
from
knives
has
assuredly
never
felt
the
effect
of
a
blow

taken
from
the
mouth
of
one
person
and
placed
in
that
of
one
of
his
remote
ancestors
in
such
a
manner
without
in
any
great
degree
altering
the
matter
of
lo
works
all
the
scenes
and
persons
introduced
were
transferred
to
much
earlier
dynasties
than
those
affected
by
the
incomparable
writer
himself
the
final
effect
being
to
give
an
air
of
extreme
unoriginality
to
his
really
undoubtedly
genuine
conceptions
with
his
accomplishment
and
followed
by
a
hired
person
of
low
class
bearing
the
writings
which

nature

the
research
necessary
in
fixing
the
various
dates
and
places
so
that
even
the
wary
should
be
deceived

forth
to
complete
his

task

and

of

hitherto
venerated

a

await

read
so
far
he
paused
in
order
to
give
the
other
an
opportunity
of
breaking
in
and
offering
half
his
possessions
to
be
allowed
to
share
in
the
undertaking
as
he
remained
unaccountably
silent
however
an
inelegant
pause
occurred
which
this
person
at
length
broke
by
desiring
an
expressed
opinion
on
the
matter
exceedingly
painstaking
but
nevertheless
highly
inopportune
kai
lung
he
replied
at
length
while
in
his
countenance
this
person
read
an
expression
of
towards
his
venture
your
entrancing
efforts
do
undoubtedly
appear
to
attract
the
undesirable
attention
of
some
spiteful
and
tyrannical
demon
this
and
elaborately
devised
work
is
in
reality
not
worth
the
labour
of
a
single
stroke
nor
is
there
in
all
peking
a
sender
forth
of
printed
leaves
who
would
encourage
any
project
connected
with
its
the
importance
of
such
a
fact
as
that
which
would
clearly
show
the
hitherto
venerated
lo
kuan
chang
to
be
a
person
who
passed
off
as
his
own
the
work
of
an
earlier
one
cried
this
person
in
despair
well
knowing
that
the
deliberately
expressed
opinion
of
the
one
before
him
was
a
matter
that
would
rule
all
others
the
interest
of
the
interest
would
not
demand
more
than
a
few
lines
in
the
ordinary
printed
leaves
replied
the
other
calmly
in
a
manner
of
speaking
it
is
entirely
a
detail
of
no
consequence
whether
or
not
the
sublime
lo
kuan
ever
existed
in
reality
his
very
commonplace
name
may
have
been
simply
lung
his
inspired
work
may
have
been
written
a
score
of
dynasties
before
him
by
some
other
person
or
they
may
have
been
composed
by
the
enlightened
emperor
of
the
period
who
desired
to
conceal
the
fact
yet
these
matters
would
not
for
a
moment
engage
the
interest
of
any
ordinary
lo
kuan
chang
is
not
a
person
in
the
ordinary
expression
he
is
an
embodiment
of
a
distinguished
and
utterly
unassailable
national
institution
the
works
with
which
he
is
by
general
consent
connected
form
the
necessary
unchangeable
standard
of
literary
excellence
and
remain
for
ever
above
rivalry
and
above
mistrust
for
this
reason
the
matter
is
plainly
one
which
does
not
interest
this
the
course
of
a
not
uneventful
existence
this
person
has
suffered
many
reverses
and
disappointments
during
his
youth
the
empress
on
one
occasion
stopped
and
openly
complimented
him
on
the
dignified
outline
presented
by
his
body
in
profile
and
when
he
was
relying
upon
this
incident
to
secure
him
a
very
remunerative
public
office
a
jealous
and
powerful
mandarin
substituted
a
somewhat
similar
though
really
very
much
inferior
person
for
him
at
the
interview
which
the
empress
had
commanded
frequently
in
matters
of
commerce
which
have
appeared
to
promise
very
satisfactorily
at
the
beginning
this
person
has
been
induced
to
entrust
sums
of
money
to
others
when
he
had
hoped
from
the
indications
and
the
manner
of
speaking
that
the
exact
contrary
would
be
the
case
and
in
one
instance
he
was
released
at
a
vast
price
from
the
torture
dungeon
in
canton
where
he
had
been
thrown
by
the
subtle
and
unconscientious
plots
of
one
who
could
not
relate
stories
in
so
accurate
and
unvarying
a
manner
as
himself
on
the
day
before
that
on
which
all
persons
were
freely
set
at
liberty
on
account
of
exceptional
public
rejoicing
yet
in
spite
of
these
and
many
other
very
unendurable
incidents
this
impetuous
and
being
never
felt
so
great
a
desire
to
retire
to
a
solitary
place
and
there
disfigure
himself
permanently
as
a
mark
of
his
unfeigned
internal
displeasure
as
on
the
occasion
when
he
endured
extreme
poverty
and
great
personal
inconvenience
for
an
entire
year
in
order
that
he
might
take
away
face
from
the
memory
of
a
person
who
was
so
placed
that
no
one
expressed
any
interest
in
the
matter
then
this
very
and
really
necessitous
person
has
devoted
himself
to
the
honourable
but
exceedingly
arduous
and
in
general
unremunerative
occupation
of
to
this
he
would
add
nothing
save
that
not
infrequently
a
and
audience
is
so
entranced
with
his
commonplace
efforts
to
hold
the
attention
especially
when
a
story
not
hitherto
known
has
been
related
that
in
order
to
afford
it
an
opportunity
of
expressing
its
gratification
he
has
been
requested
to
allow
another

to
be
made
by
all
persons
present

the
conclusion

unrestful

that
of
the
locust
plains

the
great
wall

every
speech
which
passed

two
faces
one
fair
to
hear
as
a
greeting
but
the
other
insidiously
speaking
behind
a
screen
of
rebellion
violence
and
the
hope
of
overturning
the
fixed
order
of
events
with
those
whom
they
did
not

persons
spoke
in
low
voices
of
definite
plans

at

times
there
might
appear
in
prominent
places
of
the
city
skilfully
composed
notices
setting
forth
great
wrongs
and
injustices
towards
which
resignation
and
a
lowly
bearing
were
outwardly
counselled
yet
with
the
same
words
cunningly
inflaming
the
minds
even
of
the
patient
as
no
pouring
out
of
passionate
thoughts
and
undignified
threatenings
could
have
done

the
people

and
unsuspected

the
agents
of
the
three
societies
while
to
the
many
of

was
desired
or
even
thought
of
behind
the
downfall
of
their
own
officials
and
chief
of
all
the
execution
of
the
and
depraved
mandarin
ping

whose
cruelties
and
extortions
had
made
his
name
an
object
of
wide
and
deserved
loathing
the
agents

regarded
the
city
as
a
bright
spot
in
the
line
of
blood
and
fire
which
they
were
fanning
into
life
from
peking
to
canton
and
which
would
presumably
burst
forth
and
involve
the
entire
empire
although
it
had
of
late
become
a
plain
fact
by
reason
of
the
manner
of
behaving
of
the
people
that
events
of
a
sudden
and
turbulent
nature
could
not
long
be
restrained
yet
outwardly
there
was
no
exhibition
of
violence
not
even
to
the
length
of
resisting
those
whom
ping
siang
sent
to
enforce
his
unjust
demands
chiefly
because
a
whisper
had
been
sent
round
that
nothing
was
to
be
done
until
tung
fel
should
arrive
which
would
not
be
until
the
seventh
day
in
the
month
of
winged
dragons
to
this
all
persons
agreed
for
the
more
aged
among
them
who
by
virtue
of
their
years
were
also
the
formers
of
opinion
in
all
matters
called
up
within
their
memories
certain
events
connected
with
the
two
persons
in
question
which
appeared
to
give
to
tung
fel
the
privilege
of
expressing
himself
clearly
when
the
matter
of
finally
dealing
with
the
malicious
and
mandarin
should
be
engaged
upon
among
the
mountains
which
enclose

the
southern
side
dwelt
a
who
also
kept
goats
although
a
young
man
and
entirely
without
relations
he
had
by
patient
industry
contrived
to
collect
together
a
large
flock
of
the
and
most
prolific
goats
to
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
all
the
money
which
he
received
in
exchange
for
jade
being
quickly
bartered
again
for
the
finest
animals
which
he
could
obtain
he
was
dauntless
in
penetrating
to
the
most
inaccessible
parts
of
the
mountains
in
search
of
the
stone
unfailing
in
his
skilful
care
of
the
flock
in
which
he
took
much
honourable
pride
and
on
all
occasions
discreet
and
unassumingly
restrained
in
his
discourse
and
manner
of
life
knowing
this
to
be
his
invariable
practice
it
was
with
emotions
of
an
agreeable
curiosity
that
on
the
seventh
day
of
the
month
of
winged
dragons
those
persons
who
were
passing
from
place
to
place
in
the
city
beheld
this
young
man
yang

descending
the
mountain
path
with
unmistakable
signs
of
profound
agitation
and
an
entire
absence
of
prudent
care
following
him
closely
to
the
inner
square
of
the
city
on
the
continually
expressed
plea
that
they
themselves
had
business
in
that
quarter
these
persons
observed
yang

take
up
a
position
of
unendurable
dejection
as
he
gazed
reproachfully
at
the
figure
of
the
buddha
which
surmounted
the
temple
where
it
was
his
custom
to
sacrifice
he
exclaimed
lifting
up
his
voice
when
it
became
plain
that
a
large
number
of
people
was
assembled
awaiting
his
words
what
end
does
a
person
strive
in
this
excessively
district
or
is
it
that
this
obscure

one

is
marked
out

white
cross

humiliation

ruin

and
sacred
temple
of
ancestral
virtues
wherein
the
meanest
can
repose
their
trust
he
has
none
while
now
being
more
destitute
than
the
beggar
at
the
gate
the
hope
of
honourable
marriage
and
a
robust
family
of
sons
is
more
remote
than
the
chance
of
finding
the
crystal
image
which
marks
the
last
footstep
of
the
pure
one
yesterday
this
person
possessed
no
secret
store
of
silver
or
gold
nor
had
he
knowledge
of
any
special
amount
of
jade
hidden
among
the
mountains
but
to
his
call
there
responded
four
score
goats
the
most
select
and
majestic
to
be
found
in
all
the
province
of
which
nevertheless
it
was
his
yearly
custom
to
sacrifice
one
as
those
here
can
testify
and
to
offer
another
as
a
duty
to
the
yamen
of
ping
siang
in
neither
case
opening
his
eyes
widely
when
the
hour
for
selecting
arrived
yet
in
what
an
unseemly
manner
is
his
respectful
piety
and
courteous
loyalty
rewarded
before
this
person
went
forth
on
his
usual
quest
there
came
those
bearing
written
papers
by
which
they
claimed
on
the
authority
of
ping
siang
the
whole
of
this
flock
as
a
punishment
and
fine
for
his
not
contributing
without
warning
to
the
celebration
of
kissing
the
face
the
very
obligation
of
such
a
matter
being
entirely
unknown
to
him
nevertheless
those
who
came
drove
off
this
entire
wealth
the
desperately
won
increase
of
a
life
full
of
great
toil
and
uncomplainingly
endured
hardship
leaving
him
only
his
cave
in
the
rocks
which
even
the
most
grasping
of
mandarins
can
not
remove
his
cloak
of
skins
which
no
beggar
would
gratefully
receive
and
a
bright
and
increasing
light
of
deep
hate
scorching
within
his
mind
which
nothing
but
the
blood
of
the
obdurate
extortioner
can
efficiently
quench
no
protection
of
charms
or
bowmen
shall
avail
him
for
in
his
craving
for
just
revenge
this
person
will
meet
witchcraft
with
a
cause
and
oppose
an
unsleeping
subtlety
against
strength
therefore
let
not
the
innocent
suffer
through
an
insufficient
understanding
o
divine
one
but
direct
the
hand
of
your
faithful
worshipper
towards
the
heart
that
is
proud
in
tyranny
and
holds
as
empty
words
the
clearly
defined
promise
of
an
scarcely
had
yang
hu
made
an
end
of
speaking
before
there
happened
an
event
which
could
be
regarded
in
no
other
light
than
as
a
direct
answer
to
his
plainly
expressed
request
for
a
definite
sign
upon
the
clear
air
which
had
become
unnaturally
still
at
yang
words
as
though
to
remove
any
chance
of
doubt
that
this
indeed
was
the
requested
answer
came
the
loud
beating
of
many
very
powerful
brass
gongs
indicating
the
approach
of
some
person
of
undoubted
importance
in
a
very
brief
period
the
procession
reached
the
square
the
being
followed
by
persons
carrying
banners
bowmen
in
armour
others
bearing
various
weapons
and
instruments
of
torture
slaves
displaying
innumerable
changes
of
raiment
to
prove
the
rank
and
consequence
of
their
master
umbrella
carriers
and
fan
wavers
and
finally
preceded
by
incense
burners
and
surrounded
by
servants
who
cleared
away
all
obstructions
by
means
of
their
formidable
and
heavily
knotted
lashes
the
unworthy
and
deceitful
mandarin
ping
siang
who
sat
in
a
and
elaborately
wrought
chair
looking
from
side
to
side
with
gestures
and
expressions
of
contempt
and
cupidity
at
the
sign
of
this
powerful
but
unscrupulous
person
all
those
who
were
present
fell
upon
their
faces
leaving
a
broad
space
in
their
midst
except
yang
hu
who
stepped
back
into
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
being
resolved
that
he
would
not
prostrate
himself
before
one
whom
heaven
had
pointed
out
as
the
proper
object
of
his
just
vengeance
when
the
chair
of
ping
siang
could
no
longer
be
observed
in
the
distance
and
the
sound
of
his
many
gongs
had
died
away
all
the
persons
who
had
knelt
at
his
approach
rose
to
their
feet
meeting
each
eyes
with
glances
of
assured
and
profound
significance
at
length
there
stepped
forth
an
exceedingly
aged
man
who
was
generally
believed
to
have
the
power
of
reading
omens
and
forecasting
futures
so
that
at
his
upraised
hand
all
persons
became
silent
he
exclaimed
can
turn
aside
in
doubt
from
the
deliberately
pointed
finger
of
buddha
henceforth
in
spite
of
the
suggestions
of
those
who
would
shield
him
under
the
plea
of
exacting
orders
from
high
ones
at
peking
or
extortions
practised
by
slaves
under
him
of
which
he
is
ignorant
there
can
no
longer
be
any
two
voices
concerning
the
guilty
one
yet
what
does
the
knowledge
of
the
cry
avail
the
golden
carp
in
the
shallow
waters
of
the
a
prickly
mormosa
is
an
adequate
protection
against
a
naked
man
armed
only
with
a
just
cause
and
a
company
of
bowmen
has
been
known
to
quench
an
entire
desire
for
retribution
this
person
and
doubtless
others
also
would
have
experienced
a
more
heartfelt
enthusiasm
in
the
matter
if
the
sublime
and
omnipotent
buddha
had
gone
a
step
further
and
pointed
out
not
only
the
one
to
be
punished
but
also
the
instrument
by
which
the
destiny
could
be
prudently
and
effectively
from
the
mountain
path
which
led
to
yang
cave
came
a
voice
like
an
expressly
devised
reply
to
this
speech
it
was
that
of
some
person
uttering
the
of
rewards
and
strong
is
the
mountain
sycamore

the
middle

and
the
eye
of

foliage

power
and
nourishment
from
all
around
so
that
weeds
alone
may
flourish
under
its
shadow
find
safety
within
the
hollow
of
its
trunk
its
branches

vampires
and
all

of
evil
things
which

upon
the
innocent
wild
boar
of
the

their
tusks
against
the
bark
for
it
is
harder
than
flint
and
the
axe
of
the
woodsman
turns
back
upon
the
striker

no
power
against
me
nor
can
the
fiercest

a
greater
or
a
more
powerful
than
this

all

obey
the
weeds
bow
their
heads
whispering
among
themselves
voice
of
the
tall
one
we
hear
but
not
that
of

indeed
it
is
doubtless
as
he
his
heaven
buddha
laughs
and
not
deigning
to
raise
his
head
from
the
lap
of
the
phœnix
goddess
he
thrusts
forth
a
stone
which
lies
by
his
foot

it
carefully
o
presumptuous
little
one
for
it

hot
to
the
thunderbolt

and
the
mighty
tree
is
rent
in

asked
for
my
messenger
said
the
pure
one
turning
again
to
repose
he
with
the
last
spoken
word
there
came
into
the
sight
of
those
who
were
collected
together
a
person
of
stern
yet
engaging
appearance
his
hands
and
face
were
the
colour
of
mulberry
stain
by
long
exposure
to
the
sun
while
his
eyes
looked
forth
like
two
outside
a
camp
his
long
pigtail
was
tangled
with
the
binding
tendrils
of
the
forest
and
damp
with
the
dew
of
an
open
couch
his
apparel
was
in
no
way
striking
or
brilliant
yet
he
strode
with
the
dignity
and
air
of
a
high
official
pushing
before
him
a
covered
box
upon
wheels
is
tung
fel
cried
many
who
stood
there
watching
his
approach
in
tones
which
showed
those
who
spoke
to
be
inspired
by
a
variety
of
impressive
emotions
this
is
the
seventh
day
of
the
month
of
winged
dragons
and
as
he
specifically
stated
would
be
the
case
lo
he
has
few
were
the
words
of
greeting
which
tung
fel
accorded
even
to
the
most
venerable
of
those
who
awaited
him
person
has
slept
partaken
of
fruit
and
herbs
and
devoted
an
allotted
time
to
inward
contemplation
he
said
briefly
and
more
weighty
matters
than
the
exchange
of
dignified
compliments
and
the
admiration
of
each
profiles
remain
to
be
accomplished
what
for
example
is
the
significance
of
the
written
parchment
which
is
displayed
in
so
obtrusive
a
manner
before
our
eyes
bring
it
to
this
person
without
at
these
words
all
those
present
followed
tung
gaze
with
astonishment
for
conspicuously
displayed
upon
the
wall
of
the
temple
was
a
written
notice
which
all
joined
in
asserting
had
not
been
there
the
moment
before
though
no
man
had
approached
the
spot
nevertheless
it
was
quickly
brought
to
tung
fel
who
took
it
without
any
fear
or
hesitation
and
read
aloud
the
words
which
it
contained
the
persons
of
the
span
of
existence
of
any
upon
this
earth
is
brief
and
not
to
be
considered
therefore
o
unfortunate
dwellers
of
let
it
not
affect
your
digestion
that
your
bodies
are
in
peril
of
sudden
and
most
excruciating
tortures
and
your
family
temples
in
danger
of
humiliating
disregard
do
your
thoughts
follow
the
actions
of
the
noble
mandarin
ping
siang
so
insidiously
and
why
after
each
unjust
exaction
do
your
eyes
look
redly
towards
the
yamen
he
not
the
little
finger
of
those
at
peking
obeying
their
commands
and
only
carrying
out
the
taxation
which
others
have
devised
indeed
he
himself
has
stated
such
to
be
the
fact
if
therefore
a
terrible
and
unforeseen
fate
overtook
the
usually
cautious
and
ping
siang
doubtless
perhaps
after
the
lapse
of
some
considerable
time
another
would
be
sent
from
peking
for
a
like
purpose
and
in
this
way
after
a
period
of
rest
and
prosperity
affairs
would
regulate
themselves
into
almost
as
unendurable
a
condition
as
before
ponder
these
things
well
o
yesterday
the
only
of
huang
the
was
taken
away
to
be
sold
into
slavery
by
the
emissaries
of
the
most
just
ping
siang
who
would
not
have
acted
thus
we
are
assured
were
it
not
for
the
insatiable
ones
at
peking
as
it
had
become
plain
that
the
very
necessitous
huang
had
no
other
possession
to
contribute
to
the
amount
to
be
expended
in
coloured
lights
as
a
mark
of
public
rejoicing
on
the
occasion
of
the
moonday
of
the
sublime
emperor
the
illiterate
and
huang
having
in
a
most
unseemly
manner
reviled
and
even
assailed

who
acted
in
the
matter

been
effectively
disposed
of
and
his
wife
now
alternately
laughs
and
shrieks
in
the
establishment
of
irregular
intellects
this
reason
gazer
and
because
the
matter
touches
you
more
closely
than
in
your
security
you
are
prone
to
think

expediently
with
the
time
at
your
disposal
look
twice
and
lingeringly
upon
the
face
of
your
and
clasp
the
form
of
your
favourite
one
in
a
closer
embrace
for
he
by
whose
hand
the
blow
is
directed

already
have
cast
devouring
eyes
upon
their
fairness
and
he
may
say
to
his
armed
men

come

her
to
the
last
sentence
of
the
and
undoubtedly
notice
this
person
will
take
two
phrases
remarked
tung
fel
folding
the
written
paper
and
placing
it
among
his
garments
shall
serve
him
as
the
title
of
the
lifelike
and
play
which
it
is
his
intention
now
to
disclose
to
this
select
and
unprejudiced
gathering
the
scene
represents
an
enlightened
and
justice
overtaking
an
arrogant
and
intolerable
being
who
need
this
person
add
existed
many
dynasties
ago
and
the
title
is
time
is
come
by
whose
hand
delivering
himself
in
this
manner
tung
fel
drew
back
the
hanging
drapery
which
concealed
the
front
of
his
large
box
and
disclosed
to
those
who
were
gathered
round
not
as
they
had
expected
a
passage
from
the
record
of
the
three
kingdoms
or
some
other
dramatic
work
of
undoubted
merit
but
an
ingeniously
constructed
representation
of
a
scene
outside
the
walls
of
their
own
on
one
side
was
a
small
but
minutely
accurate
copy
of
a
hut
which
was
known
to
all
present
while
behind
stood
out
the
distant
but
nevertheless
unmistakable
walls
of
the
city
but
it
was
the
nearest
part
of
the
spectacle
that
first
held
the
attention
of
the
entranced
beholders
for
there
disported
themselves
in
every
variety
of
guileless
and
attractive
attitude
a
number
of
young
and
entirely
unconcerned
doves
scarcely
had
the
delighted
onlookers
fully
observed
the
pleasing
and
effective
scene
or
uttered
their
expressions
of
polished
satisfaction
at
the
graceful
and
unassuming
behaviour
of
the
pretty
creatures
before
them
than
the
view
entirely
changed
and
as
if
by
magic
the
massive
and
inelegant
building
of
ping
yamen
was
presented
before
them
as
all
gazed
astonished
the
great
door
of
the
yamen
opened
stealthily
and
without
a
pause
a
lean
and
rat
of
unnatural
size
and
rapacity
dashed
out
and
seized
the
most
select
and
engaging
of
the
unsuspecting
prey
in
its
hungry
jaws
with
the
expiring
cry
of
the
innocent
victim
the
entire
box
was
immediately
and
in
the
most
unexpected
manner
involved
in
a
profound
darkness
which
cleared
away
as
suddenly
and
revealed
the
forms
of
the
despoiler
and
the
victim
lying
dead
by
each
side
tung
fel
came
forward
to
receive
the
compliments
of
all
who
had
witnessed
the
entertainment
may
be
objected
he
remarked
the
play
is
in
a
manner
of
expressing
self
incomplete
for
it
is
unrevealed
by
whose
hand
the
act
of
justice
was
accomplished
yet
in
this
detail
is
the
accuracy
of
the
representation
justified
for
though
the
time
has
come
the
hand
by
which
retribution
is
accorded
shall
never
be
in
such
a
manner
did
tung
fel
come
to
on
the
seventh
day
of
the
month
of
winged
dragons
throwing
aside
all
restraint
and
no
longer
urging
prudence
or
delay
of
all
the
throng
which
stood
before
him
scarcely
one
was
without
a
deep
offence
against
ping
siang
while
those
who
had
not
as
yet
suffered
feared
what
the
morrow
might
display
a
wandering
monk
from
the
island
of
irredeemable
plagues
was
the
first
to
step
forth
in
response
to
tung
plainly
understood
suggestion
is
no
necessity
for
this
person
to
undertake
further
acts
of
benevolence
he
remarked
dropping
the
cloak
from
his
shoulder
and
displaying
the
hundred
and
eight
scars
of
extreme
virtue
he
continued
holding
up
his
left
hand
from
which
three
fingers
were
burnt
away
greater
endurances
been
neglected
yet
the
matter
before
this
distinguished
gathering
is
one
which
merits
the
favourable
consideration
of
all
persons
and
this
one
will
in
no
manner
turn
away
recounting
former
actions
while
he
allows
others
to
press
forward
towards
the
accomplishment
of
the
just
and
with
these
words
the
devout
and
unassuming
person
in
question
inscribed
his
name
upon
a
square
piece
of
attesting
his
sincerity
to
the
fixed
purpose
for
which
it
was
designed
by
dipping
his
thumb
into
the
mixed
blood
of
the
slain
animals
and
impressing
this
unalterable
seal
upon
the
paper
also
he
was
followed
by
a
seller
of
drugs
and
subtle
medicines
whose
entire
stock
had
been
seized
and
destroyed
by
order
of
ping
siang
so
that
no
one
in
might
obtain
poison
for
his
destruction
then
came
an
overwhelming
stream
of
persons
all
of
whom
had
received
some
severe
and
injury
at
the
hands
of
the
malicious
and
vindictive
mandarin
all
these
followed
a
similar
observance
inscribing
their
names
and
binding
themselves
by
the
blood
oath
last
of
all
yang
hu
stepped
up
partly
from
a
natural
modesty
which
restrained
him
from
offering
himself
when
so
many
more
versatile
persons
of
proved
excellence
were
willing
to
engage
in
the
matter
and
partly
because
an
conflict
was
taking
place
within
his
mind
as
to
whether
the
extreme
course
which
was
contemplated
was
the
most
expedient
to
pursue
at
last
however
he
plainly
perceived
that
he
could
not
honourably
withhold
himself
from
an
affair
that
was
in
a
measure
the
direct
outcome
of
his
own
unendurable
loss
so
that
without
further
hesitation
he
added
his
obscure
name
to
the
many
illustrious
ones
already
in
tung
keeping
when
at
length
dark
fell
upon
the
city
and
the
cries
of
the
watchmen
warning
all
prudent
ones
to
bar
well
their
doors
against
robbers
as
they
themselves
were
withdrawing
until
the
morrow
no
longer
rang
through
the
narrow
ways
of
all
those
persons
who
had
pledged
themselves
by
name
and
seal
went
forth
silently
and
came
together
at
the
place
whereof
tung
fel
had
secretly
conveyed
them

there
tung
fel
standing
somewhat
apart
placed
all
the
folded
papers
in
the
form
of
a
circle
and
having
performed
over
them
certain
observances
designed
to
insure
a
just
decision
and
to
keep
away
evil
influences
submitted
the
selection
to
the
discriminating
choice
of
the
sacred
flat
and
round
sticks
having
in
this
manner
secured
the
name
of
the
appointed
person
who
should
carry
out
the
act
of
justice
and
retribution

the
paper

certain
words
upon
it
and

forward

nor
indeed
for
sentences
of
dignified
length
no
matter
how
pleasantly
turned
to
the
ear
they
may
be
before
this
person
stand
many
who
are
undoubtedly
illustrious
in
various
arts
and
virtues
yet
one
among
them
is
marked
out
for
distinction
in
that
his
name
shall
be
handed
down
in
imperishable
history
as
that
of
a
patriot
of
a
and
uncompromising
degree
with
him
there
is
no
need
of
further
speech
and
to
this
end
i
have
inscribed
certain
words
upon
his
namepaper
to
everyone
this
person
will
now
return
the
paper
which
has
been
entrusted
to
him
folded
so
that
the
nature
of
its
contents
shall
be
an
unwritten
leaf
to
all
others
nor
shall
the
papers
be
unfolded
by
any
until
he
is
within
his
own
chamber
with
barred
doors
where
all
save
the
one
who
shall
find
the
message
shall
remain
not
venturing
forth
until
daybreak
i
tung
fel
have
spoken
and
assuredly
i
shall
not
eat
my
word
which
is
that
a
certain
and
most
degrading
death
awaits
any
who
transgress
these
it
was
with
the
short
and
sudden
breath
of
the
cowering
antelope
when
the
stealthy
tread
of
the
pitiless
tiger
approaches
its
lair
that
yang
hu
opened
his
paper
in
the
seclusion
of
his
own
cave
for
his
mind
was
darkened
with
an
inspired
inside
emotion
that
he
the
one
doubting
among
the
eagerly
proffering
and
destructively
inclined
multitude
would
be
chosen
to
accomplish
the
high
aim
for
which
indeed
he
felt
exceptionally
unworthy
the
written
sentence
which
he
perceived
immediately
upon
unfolding
the
paper
instructing
him
to
appear
again
before
tung
fel
at
the
hour
of
midnight
was
therefore
nothing
but
the
echo
and
fulfilment
of
his
own
thoughts
and
served
in
reality
to
impress
his
mind
with
calmer
feelings
of
dignified
unconcern
than
would
have
been
the
case
had
he
not
been
chosen
having
neither
possessions
nor
relations
the
occupation
of
disposing
of
his
goods
and
making
ceremonious
and
affectionate
leavetakings
of
his
family
against
the
occurrence
of
any
unforeseen
disaster
engrossed
no
portion
of
yang
time
yet
there
was
one
matter
to
which
no
reference
has
yet
been
made
but
which
now
forces
itself
obtrusively
upon
the
attention
which
was
in
a
large
measure
responsible
for
many
of
the
most
prominent
actions
of
yang
life
and
indeed
in
no
small
degree
influenced
his
hesitation
in
offering
himself
before
tung
fel
not
a
bowshot
distance
from
the
place
where
the
mountain
path
entered
the
outskirts
of
the
city
lived
with
her
parents
who
were
persons
of
assured
position
though
of
no
particular
wealth
for
a
period
not
confined
to
a
single
year
it
had
been
the
custom
of
yang
hu
to
offer
to
this
elegant
and
refined
maiden
all
the
rarest
pieces
of
jade
which
he
could
discover
while
the
most
symmetrical
and
remunerative
in
his
flock
enjoyed
the
honourable
distinction
of
bearing
her
incomparable
name
towards
the
almond
garden
of
abode
yang
hu
turned
his
footsteps
upon
leaving
his
cave
and
standing
there
concealed
from
all
sides
by
the
white
and
abundant
foliage
he
uttered
a
sound
which
had
long
been
an
agreed
signal
between
them
presently
a
faint
perfume
of
spoke
of
her
near
approach
and
without
delay
hiya
herself
stood
by
his
side
one
said
yang
hu
when
at
length
they
had
gazed
upon
each
features
and
made
renewals
of
their
protestations
of
mutual
regard
fixed
intentions
of
a
person
have
often
been
fitly
likened
to
the
seed
of
the
so
ineffectual
are
their
efforts
among
the
winds
of
constantly
changing
circumstance
the
definite
hope
of
this
person
had
long
pointed
towards
a
small
but
adequate
habitation
surrounded
by
and
not
far
distant
from
the
jade
cliffs
and
pastures
which
would
afford
a
sufficient
remuneration
and
a
means
of
living
this
entrancing
picture
has
been
blotted
out
for
the
time
and
in
its
place
this
person
finds
himself
face
to
face
with
an
arduous
and
dangerous
undertaking
followed
perhaps
by
hasty
and
immediate
flight
yet
if
the
adorable
hiya
will
prove
the
unchanging
depths
of
her
constantly
expressed
intention
by
accompanying
him
as
far
as
the
village
of
hing
where
suitable
marriage
ceremonies
can
be
observed
without
delay
the
exile
will
in
reality
be
in
the
nature
of
a
triumphal
procession
and
the
emotions
with
which
this
person
has
hitherto
regarded
the
entire
circumstance
will
undergo
a
complete
and
highly
accomplished
yang
exclaimed
the
maiden
whose
feelings
at
hearing
these
words
were
in
no
way
different
from
those
of
her
lover
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
opening
the
folded
paper
upon
which
tung
fel
had
written
is
the
nature
of
the
mission
upon
which
you
are
so
impetuously
resolved
and
why
will
it
be
followed
by
flight
nature
of
the
undertaking
can
not
be
revealed
by
reason
of
a
deliberately
taken
oath
replied
yang
hu
the
reason
of
its
possible
consequence
is
a
less
important
question
to
the
two
persons
who
are
here
conversing
together
than
of
whether
the
amiable
and
graceful
hiya
is
willing
to
carry
out
her
desire
for
an
opportunity
of
displaying
the
true
depths
of
her
emotions
towards
this
said
hiya
sentiments
which
this
person
expressed
with
irreproachable
honourableness
when
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
and
the
probability
of
secretly
leaving
an
undoubtedly
home
was
engagingly
remote
seem
to
have
an
entirely
different
significance
when
recalled
by
night
in
a
damp
orchard
and
on
the
eve
of
their
fulfilment
to
deceive
parents
is
an
ignoble
prospect
furthermore
it
is
often
an
exceedingly
difficult
undertaking
let
the
matter
be
arranged
in
this
way
that
yang
leaves
the
ultimate
details
of
the
scheme
to
expedient
care

without
delay
to

or
even
more
desirable
to
the
further
town
of
liyunnan
and
there
awaiting
her
coming
by
such
means
the
risk
of
discovery
and
pursuit
will
be
lessened
yang
will
be
able
to
set
forth
on
his
journey
with
greater
speed
and
this
one
will
have
an
opportunity
of
getting
together
certain
articles
without
which
indeed
she
would
be
very
inadequately
in
spite
of
his
conscientious
desire
that
hiya
should
be
by
his
side
on
the
journey
together
with
an
unendurable
certainty
that
evil
would
arise
from
the
course
she
proposed
yang
was
compelled
by
an
innate
feeling
of
respect
to
agree
to
her
wishes
and
in
this
manner
the
arrangement
was
definitely
concluded
thereupon
hiya
without
delay
returned
to
the
dwelling
remarking
that
otherwise
her
absence
might
be
detected
and
the
entire
circumstance
thereby
discovered
leaving

to
continue
his
journey
and
again
present

had
been
instructed

a
variety
of
other
matters

be
clearly
perceived
weapons
and
devices
for
reading
the
future
he
greeted
yang
with
many
tokens
of
dignified
respect
and
with
an
evidently
restrained
emotion
led
him
towards
the
light
of
a
hanging
lantern
where
he
gazed
into
his
face
for
a
considerable
period
with
every
indication
of
exceptional
concern

said
at

and
searching

of

in
all
these
out
of
a
wisdom
gained
by
deep
endurance
and
a
experience
beyond

common

be

at

administered
to

the
oath
of

and
the
one
called
the
unutterable
which
may
not
be
further
described
in
written
words
thereby
binding
his
body
and

and
the
souls
and

of
all

gone
before

and
all

accomplishment
of

being
thus
complete
between

gave
him
a
mask
with
which
he
should
pass
unknown
through
the
streets
and
into
the
presence
of
ping

a
variety
of
weapons
to
use
as
the
occasion
arose
and
a
sign
by
which
the
attendants
at

yamen
would
admit
him
without
further
questioning

passed
through

deserted

aware
of

mournful
and
foreboding
sounds
which
accompanied
him
on

sides
while
shadowy
faces
bearing
signs
of
intolerable
anguish
and
despair
continually
formed
themselves
out
of

wind
by
the
time

reached
the
yamen
a
tempest
of
exceptional
violence

in
progress
nor
were
other
omens
absent
which
tended
to
indicate
that
matters
of
a
very
unpropitious
nature
were
about
to
take
place
at
each
successive
door
of
the
yamen
the
attendant
stepped
back
and
covered
his
face
so
that
he
should
by
no

perceive
who

come
upon

destructive
a
mission

a
person
who
passed
his
entire

in
altering
the
fixed

of

and
who
never
went
beyond
his
outer
gate
without
an
armed
company
of
bowmen

with
so
incautious
a
contempt
that
without
any
hesitation
he
drew
forth
his
brush

in
a

bitter

then
without

delay
threw
open

stepped
into

quickly
so
that

leave

consent

of
these
great
honours
however
the
undoubted
perversity
of
her
nature
made
her
an
easy
accomplice
to
the
duplicity
of
tung
fel
who
by
means
of
various
disguises
found
frequent
opportunity
of
uttering
in
her
presence
numerous
suggestions
specially
designed
to
lead
her
imagination
towards
an
existence
in
which
this
person
had
no
adequate
representation
becoming
at
length
terrified
at
the
possibility
of
these
unworthy
emotions
obtruding
themselves
upon
this
notice
the
two

fled
together
taking
with
them
the

who
without
any
doubt
is
now
before
me
despite
the
most
assiduous
search
and
very
tempting
and
profitable
offers
of
reward
no
information
of
a
reliable
nature
could
be
obtained
and
at
length
this
dispirited
and
completely
changed
person
gave
up
the
pursuit
as
unavailing
with
his
son
and
heir
upon
whose
future
he
had
greatly
hoped
all
emotions
of
a
generous
and
nature
left
him
and
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
he
became
the
avaricious
and
deservedly
unpopular
individual
against
whose
extortions
the
amiable
and
ones
of

for
so
many
years
protested
mildly
the
sudden
and
not
altogether
unexpected
fate
which
is
now
on
the
point
of
reaching
him
is
altogether
too
lenient
to
be
entirely
my
distinguished

really
immaculate

cried
yang
hu
in
a
voice
which
expressed
the
deepest
feelings
of
contrition
oaths
or
vows
however
sacred
can
induce
this
person
to
stretch
forth
his
hand
against
the
one
who
stands
before
replied

speaking
of
the
matter
as
though
it
were
one
which
did
not
closely
concern
his
own
existence

the
unutterable
oath
would
inevitably
involve
not
only
the
two
persons
who
are
now
conversing
together
but
also
those
before

those
who
are
to
come

worse
condition

a
fate

ever
been
to
establish
a
strong

vigorous
line

end
indeed
he
was
even
now

into
accepting

inspired
the
actions
of
the
devout

said

upon
a
certain
occasion
at
as
a
consequence
his
illustrious
memory
has
suffered
somewhat
even
as
the
insignificant
may
bring
the
precious
and
many
coloured
jewel
to
the
surface
so
has
it
been
permitted
to
this
obscure
and
superficially
educated
one
to
discover
the
truth
of
the
entire
matter
among
the
and
frequently
really
illegible
documents
preserved
at
the
hall
of
public
reference
at
peking
without
fear
of
contradiction
therefore
he
now
sets
forth
the
credible
version
was
one
who
throughout
his
life
had
been
compelled
by
the
opposing
force
of
circumstances
to
be
content
with
what
was
offered
rather
than
attain
to
that
which
he
desired
having
been
allowed
to
wander
over
the
edge
of
an
exceedingly
steep
crag
while
still
a
child
by
the
aged
and
untrustworthy
person
who
had
the
care
of
him
and
yet
suffering
little
hurt
he
was
carried
back
to
the
city
in
triumph
by
the
one
in
question
who
to
cover
her
neglect
declared
amid
many
chants
of
exultation
that
as
he
slept
a
majestic
winged
form
had
snatched
him
from
her
arms
and
traced
magical
figures
with
his
body
on
the
ground
in
token
of
the
distinguished
sacred
existence
for
which
he
was
undoubtedly
set
apart
in
such
a
manner
he
became
famed
at
a
very
early
age
for
an
unassuming
mildness
of
character
and
an
almost
inspired
piety
of
life
so
that
on
every
side
frequent
opportunity
was
given
him
for
the
display
of
these
amiable
qualities
should
it
chance
that
an
insufficient
quantity
of
had
been
prepared
for
the
family
repast
the
undesirable
but
necessary
portion
of
cold
dried
rat
would
inevitably
be
allotted
to
the
uncomplaining
quen
doubtless
accompanied
by
the
engaging
but
unnecessary
remark
that
he
alone
had
a
intellect
which
was
fixed
upon
more
sublime
images
than
even
the
best
constructed
should
the
number
of
not
be
sufficient
to
bear
to
the
exhibition
of
kites
all
who
were
desirous
of
becoming
entertained
in
such
a
fashion
inevitably
would
quen
be
the
one
left
behind
in
order
that
he
might
have
adequate
leisure
for
dignified
and
internal
reflexion
this
manner
it
came
about
that
when
a
very
wealthy
but
unnaturally
avaricious
and
person
who
was
connected
with
father
in
matters
of
commerce
expressed
his
fixed
determination
that
the
most
deserving
and
enlightened
of
his
sons
should
enter
into
a
marriage
agreement
with
his
daughter
there
was
no
manner
of
hesitation
among
those
concerned
who
admitted
without
any
questioning
between
themselves
that
quen
was
undeniably
the
one
referred
to
naturally
not
possessing
an
insignificant
intellect
a
continuous
habit
together
with
a
most
irreproachable
sense
of
filial
duty
subdued
within
internal
organs
whatever
reluctance
he
might
have
otherwise
displayed
in
the
matter
so
that
as
courteously
as
was
necessary
he
presented
to
the
undoubtedly
very
ordinary
and
maiden
in
question
the
gifts
of
irretrievable
intention
and
honourably
carried
out
his
spoken
and
written
words
towards
her
a
period
of
years
the
circumstances
of
the
various
persons
did
not
in
any
degree
change
quen
in
the
meantime
becoming
more
and
with
each
after
the
manner
of
the
sublime
who
studied
to
maintain
an
unmoved
endurance
in
all
varieties
of
events
by
placing
his
body
to
a
greater
extent
each
day
in
a
vessel
of
boiling
liquid
nevertheless
the
good
and
charitable
deities
to
whom
quen
unceasingly
sacrificed
were
not
altogether
unmindful
of
his
virtues
for
a
son
was
born
and
an
evil
disease
which
arose
from
a
most
undignified
display
of
uncontrollable
emotion
on
her
part
ended
in
his
wife
being
deposited
with
becoming
ceremony
in
the
family
temple
a
certain
evening
when
quen
sat
in
his
inner
chamber
deliberating
upon
the
really
beneficent
yet
somewhat
inexplicable
arrangement
of
the
ones
to
whom
he
was
very
amiably
disposed
in
consequence
of
the
unwonted
tranquillity
which
he
now
enjoyed
yet
who
it
appeared
to
him
could
have
set
out
the
entire
matter
in
a
much
more
satisfactory
way
from
the
beginning
he
was
made
aware
by
the
unexpected
beating
of
many
gongs
and
by
other
signs
of
refined
and
deferential
welcome
that
a
person
of
exalted
rank
was
approaching
his
residence
while
he
was
still
hesitating
in
his
uncertainty
regarding
the
most
courteous
and
delicate
form
of
with
which
to
honour
so
important
a
visitor
whether
to
rush
forth
and
allow
the
to
pass
over
his
prostrate
form
to
make
a
pretence
of
being
a
slave
and
in
that
guise
doing
menial
service
or
to
conceal
himself
beneath
a
massive
and
overhanging
table
until
his
guest
should
have
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
examine
at
his
leisure
whatever
the
room
contained
the
person
in
question
stood
before
him
in
every
detail
of
dress
and
appointment
he
had
the
undoubted
appearance
of
being
one
to
whom
no
door
might
be
safely
closed
exclaimed
quen
inferior
and
is
the
mind
of
a
person
of
my
feeble
intellectual
attainments
even
at
this
moment
when
the
near
approach
of
one
who
obviously
commands
every
engaging
accomplishment
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
call
up
within
it
an
adequate
amount
of
commonplace
resource
its
possessor
finds
himself
entirely
incapable
of
conducting
himself
with
the
fitting
outward
marks
of
his
great
internal
respect
this
residence
is
certainly
unprepossessing
in
the
extreme
yet
it
contains
many
objects
of
some
value
and
of
great
rarity
illiterate
as
this
person
is
he
would
not
be
so
presumptuous
as
to
offer
any
for
your
acceptance
but
if
you
will
confer
upon
him
the
favour
of
selecting
that
which
appears
to
be
the
most
priceless
and
unreplaceable
he
will
immediately
and
with
every
manifestation
of
extreme
delight
break
it
irredeemably
in
your
honour
to
prove
the
unaffected
depth
of
his
gratified
replied
the
person
before
him
speaking
with
an
evident
sincerity
of
purpose
to
this
ears
are
your
words
breathing
as
they
do
an
obvious
hospitality
and
a
due
regard
for
the
forms
of
etiquette
but
if
indeed
you
are
desirous
of
gaining
this
explicit
regard
break
no
articles
of
fine
porcelain
or
rare
inlaid
wood
in
proof
of
it
but
immediately
dismiss
to
a
very
distant
spot
the
who
have
enclosed
him
within
two
solid
rings
and
who
are
now
carrying
out
their
duties
in
so
diligent
a
manner
that
he
greatly
doubts
if
the
unimpaired
faculties
of
hearing
will
ever
be
fully
restored
furthermore
if
your
exceedingly
amiable
intentions
desire
fuller
expression
cause
an
unstinted
number
of
vessels
of
some
uninflammable
liquid
to
be
conveyed
into
your
chrysanthemum
garden
and
there
poured
over
the
numerous
fireworks
and
coloured
lights
which
still
appear
to
be
in
progress
doubtless
they
are
marks
of
respect
but
they
caused
this
person
considerable
apprehension
as
he
passed
among
them
and
indeed
give
to
this
unusually
pleasant
and
unassuming
spot
the
by
no
means
inviting
atmosphere
of
a
garden
during
the
festivities
attending
the
birthday
of
the
sacred
person
is
overwhelmed
with
a
most
unendurable
confusion
that
the
matters
referred
to
should
have
been
regarded
in
such
a
light
replied
quen
humbly
he
himself
had
no
knowledge
of
them
until
this
moment
he
is
confident
that
they
in
no
wise
differ
from
the
usual
honourable
manifestations
with
which
it
is
customary
in
this
province
to
welcome
strangers
of
exceptional
rank
and
welcome
was
of
a
most
dignified
and
impressive
nature
replied
the
stranger
with
every
appearance
of
not
desiring
to
cause
quen
any
uneasy
internal
doubts
the
fact
is
none
the
less
true
that
at
the
moment
this
head
seems
to
contain
an
exceedingly
powerful
and
band
and
also
that
as
he
passed
through
the
courtyard
an
ingeniously
constructed
but
somewhat
unmanageable
figure
of
gigantic
size
composed
entirely
of
jets
of
flame
leaped
out
suddenly
from
behind
a
dark
wall
and
made
an
almost
successful
attempt
to
embrace
him
in
its
arms
lo
yuen
greatly
fears
that
the
time
when
he
would
have
rejoiced
in
the
necessary
display
of
agility
to
which
the
incident
gave
rise
has
for
ever
passed
yuen
exclaimed
quen
with
an
unaffected
mingling
of
the
emotions
of
reverential
awe
and
pleasureable
anticipation
it
indeed
be
an
uncontroversial
fact
that
so
learned
and
ornamental
a
person
as
the
renowned
controller
of
unsolicited
degrees
stands
beneath
this
inelegant
utterly
unpresentable
roof
now
indeed
he
plainly
understands
why
this
chamber
has
the
appearance
of
being
filled
with
a
brilliance
and
why
at
the
first
spoken
words
of
the
one
before
him
a
melodious
sound
like
the
rushing
waters
of
the
sacred
seemed
to
fill
his
the
chamber
is
pervaded
by
a
very
exceptional
splendour
replied
lo
yuen
who
in
spite
of
his
high
position
regarded
graceful
talk
and
compliments
in
a
spirit
of
this
one
has
a
fixed
conviction
that
it
is
caused
by
the
and
dragon
which
despite
your
most
assiduous
efforts
is
now
endeavouring
to
climb
through
the
aperture
behind
you
the
noise
which
still
fills
his
ears
also
resembles
rather
the
despairing
cries
of
the
ten
thousand
lost
ones
at
the
first
sight
of
the
pit
of
liquid
and
malachite
yet
without
question
both
proceed
from
the
same
cause
laying
aside
further
ceremony
therefore
permit
this
greatly
person
to
disclose
the
object
of
his
inopportune
visit
long
have
your
amiable
virtues
been
observed
and
appreciated
by
the
high
ones
at
peking
o
too
long
have
they
been
unrewarded
and
passed
over
in
silence
nevertheless
the
moment
of
acknowledgement
and
advancement
has
at
length
arrived
for
as
the

is
this

to
you
the
agreeable
intelligence
that
the
honourable
and
not
office
of
guarder
of
the
imperial
silkworms
has
been
conferred
upon
you
and
to
require
you
to
proceed
without

to
peking
so
that
fitting
ceremonies
of
admittance
may
be
performed
before
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month
of
feathered
how
frequently
does
the
purchaser
of
seemingly
vigorous
and
exceptionally
discover
when
too
late
that
they
are
in
reality
fashioned
from
the
root
of
the
prolific
and
valueless
skilfully
covered
with
a
disguising
varnish
instead
of
presenting
himself
at
the
place
of
commerce
frequented
by
those
who
entrust
money
to
others
on
the
promise
of
an
increased
repayment
when
certain
very
probable
events
have
come
to
pass
so
that
if
all
else
failed
he
would
still
possess
a
serviceable
number
of
taels
entirely
neglected
the
demands
of
a
most
ordinary
prudence
nor
could
he
be
induced
to
set
out
on
his
journey
until
he
had
passed
seven
days
in
public
feasting
to
mark
his
good
fortune
and
then
devoted
fourteen
more
days
to
fasting
and
various
acts
of
penance
in
order
to
make
known
the
regret
with
which
he
acknowledged
his
entire
unworthiness
for
the
honour
before
him
owing
to
this
very
conscientious
but
nevertheless
somewhat
manner
of
behaving
quen
found
himself
unable
to
reach
peking
before
the
day
preceding
that
to
which
lo
yuen
had
made
special
reference
from
this
cause
it
came
about
that
only
sufficient
time
remained
to
perform
the
various
ceremonies
of
admission
without
in
any
degree
counselling
quen
as
to
his
duties
and
procedure
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
really
important
office
the
many
necessary
and
venerable
ceremonies
observed
during
the
changing
periods
of
the
year
none
occupy
a
more
important
place
than
those
for
which
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month
of
feathered
insects
is
reserved
conveying
as
they
do
a
respectful
and
petition
that
the
various
affairs
upon
which
persons
in
every
condition
of
life
are
engaged
may
arrive
at
a
pleasant
and
remunerative
conclusion
at
the
earliest
stroke
of
the
gong
the
versatile
emperor
accompanied
by
many
persons
of
irreproachable
ancestry
and
certain
others
very
elaborately
attired
proceeds
to
an
open
space
set
apart
for
the
occasion
with
unassuming
dexterity
the
benevolent
emperor
for
a
brief
span
of
time
engages
in
the
menial
occupation
of
a
person
of
low
class
and
with
his
own
hands
ploughs
an
assigned
portion
of
land
in
order
that
the
enlightened
spirits
under
whose
direct
guardianship
the
earth
is
placed
may
not
become
lax
in
their
disinterested
efforts
to
promote
its
fruitfulness
in
this
charitable
exertion
he
is
followed
by
various
other
persons
of
recognized
position
the
first
being
by
custom
the
guarder
of
the
imperial
silkworms
while
at
the
same
time
the
empress
plants
an
allotted
number
of
mulberry
trees
and
deposits
upon
their
leaves
the
carefully
reared
insects
which
she
receives
from
the
hands
of
their
guarder
in
the
case
of
the
accomplished
emperor
an
ingenious
contrivance
is
resorted
to
by
which
the
soil
is
drawn
aside
by
means
of
hidden
strings
as
the
plough
passes
by
the
implement
in
question
being
itself
constructed
from
paper
of
the
highest
quality
while
the
oxen
which
draw
it
are
in
reality
ordinary
persons
cunningly
concealed
within
masks
of
cardboard
in
this
thoughtful
manner
the
actual
labours
of
the
sublime
emperor
are
greatly
lessened
while
no
chance
is
afforded
for
an
inauspicious
omen
to
be
created
by
the
rebellious
behaviour
of
a
ox
or
by
any
other
event
of
an
unforeseen
nature
all
the
other
persons
however
are
required
to
make
themselves
proficient
in
the
art
of
ploughing
before
the
ceremony
so
that
the
chances
of
the
attendant
spirits
discovering
the
deception
which
has
been
practised
upon
them
in
the
case
of
the
emperor
may
not
be
increased
by
its
needless
repetition
it
was
chiefly
for
this
reason
that
lo
yuen
had
urged
quen
to
journey
to
peking
as
speedily
as
possible
but
owing
to
the
very
short
time
which
remained
between
his
arrival
and
the
ceremony
of
ploughing
not
only
had
the
person
in
question
neglected
to
profit
by
instruction
but
he
was
not
even
aware
of
the
obligation
which
awaited
him
when
therefore
in
spite
of
every
respectful
protest
on
his
part
he
was
led
up
to
a
implement
drawn
by
two
powerful
and
undeniably
animals
it
was
with
every
sign
of
great
internal
misgivings
and
an
entire
absence
of
enthusiasm
in
the
entertainment
that
he
commenced
his
not
too
well
understood
task
in
this
matter
he
was
by
no
means
mistaken
for
it
soon
became
plain
to
all
observers
of
whom
an
immense
concourse
was
assembled
that
the
usually
guarder
of
the
imperial
silkworms
was
conducting
himself
in
a
most
undignified
manner
for
though
he
still
clung
to
the
with
an
inspired
tenacity
his
body
assumed
every
variety
of
base
and
uninviting
attitude
encouraged
by
this
inelegant
state
of
affairs
the
evil
spirits
which
are
ever
on
the
watch
to
turn
into
derision
the
charitable
intentions
of
the
entered
into
the
bodies
of
the
oxen
and
provoked
within
their
minds
a
sudden
and
malignant
confidence
that
the
time
had
arrived
when
they
might
with
safety
break
into
revolt
and
throw
off
the
outward
signs
of
their
dependent
condition
from
these
various
causes
it
came
about
that
quen
was
without
warning
borne
with
irresistible
certainty
against
the
majestic
person
of
the
sacred
emperor
the
inlaid
box
of
imperial
silkworms
which
up
to
that
time
had
remained
safely
among
the
folds
of
his
silk
garment
alone
serving
to
avert
an
even
more
violent
and
blow
said
the
wise
and
in
his
book
entitled
of
everyday
a
person

returning
from
the
city

his
house
to
be
in
flames
let
him
examine
well
the
change
which
he
has
received
from
the
before
it
is
too
late
for
evil
never
travels
scarcely
had
the
unfortunate
quen
recovered
his
natural
attributes
from
the
effect
of
the
disgraceful
occurrence
which
has
been
recorded
which
indeed
furnished
the
matter
of
a
song
and
many
unpresentable
jests
among
the
persons
of
the
city
than
the
magnanimous
empress
reached
that
detail
of
the
ceremony
when
it
was
requisite
that
she
should
deposit
the
living
emblems
of
the
desired
increase
and
prosperity
upon
the
leaves
stretching
forth
her
hand
to
quen
for
this
purpose
she
received
from
the
still
greatly
confused
person
in
question
the
imperial
silkworms
in
so
unseemly
a
condition
that
her
eyes
had
scarcely
rested
upon
them
before
she
was
seized
with
the
rigid
sickness
and
in
that
state
fell
to
the
ground
at
this
new
and
entirely
unforeseen
calamity
a
very
disagreeable
certainty
of
approaching
evil
began
to
take
possession
of
all
those
who
stood
around
many
crying
aloud
that
every
omen
of
good
was
wanting
and
declaring
that
unless
something
of
a
markedly
propitiatory
nature
was
quickly
accomplished
the
agriculture
of
the
entire
empire
would
cease
to
flourish
and
the
various
departments
of
the
commerce
in
silk
would
undoubtedly
be
thrown
into
a
state
of
most
inextricable
confusion
indeed
in
spite
of
all
things
designed
to
have
a
contrary
effect
the
matter
came
about
in
the
way
predicted
for
the
seven
times
overcame
its
restraining
barriers
and
poured
its
waters
over
the
surrounding
country
thereby
gaining
for
the
first
time
its
title
of
sorrow
of
china
by
which
dishonourable
but
exceedingly
appropriate
designation
it
is
known
to
this
day
manner
of
greeting
which
would
have
been
accorded
to
quen
had
he
returned
to
the
official
quarter
of
the
city
or
the
nature
of
his
treatment
by
the
baser
class
of
the
ordinary
people
if
they
succeeded
in
enticing
him
to
come
among
them
formed
a
topic
of
such
uninviting
conjecture
that
the
lo
yuen
who
had
observed
the
entire
course
of
events
from
an
elevated
spot
determined
to
make
a
effort
towards
his
safety
to
this
end
he
quickly
purchased
the
esteem
of
several
of
those
who
make
a
profession
of
their
strength
holding
out
the
hope
of
still
further
reward
if
they
conducted
the
venture
to
a
successful
termination
uttering
loud
cries
of
an
impending
vengeance
as
lo
yuen
had
instructed
them
in
the
matter
and
displaying
their
exceptional
proportions
to
the
astonishment
and
misgivings
of
all
beholders
these
persons
tore
open
the
in
which
quen
had
concealed
himself
and
thrusting
aside
all
opposition
quickly
dragged
him
forth
holding
him
high
upon
their
shoulders
in
spite
of
his
frequent
and
endeavours
to
cast
himself
to
the
ground
some
surrounded
those
who
bore
him
after
the
manner
of
disposing
his
troops
affected
by
a
skilful
leader
when
the
enemy
begin
to
waver
and
crying
aloud
that
it
was
their
unchanging
purpose
to
submit
him
to
the
test
of
burning
splinters
and
afterwards
to
torture
him
they
succeeded
by
this
stratagem
in
bringing
him
through
the
crowd
and
hurling
back
or
outstripping
those
who
endeavoured
to
follow
conveyed
him
secretly
and
unperceived
to
a
deserted
and
appointed
spot
here
quen
was
obliged
to
remain
until
other
events
caused
the
recollection
of
the
many
to
become
clouded
and
unconcerned
towards
him
suffering
frequent
inconveniences
in
spite
of
the
powerful
protection
of
lo
yuen
and
not
at
all
times
being
able
to
regard
the
most
necessary
repast
as
an
appointment
of
undoubted
certainty
at
length
in
the
guise
of
a
wandering
conjurer
who
was
unable
to
display
his
accomplishments
owing
to
an
entire
loss
of
the
power
of
movement
in
his
arms
quen
passed
undetected
from
the
city
and
safely
reaching
the
distant
and
unimportant
town
of
gave
himself
up
to
a
protracted
period
of
lamentation
and
at
the
unprepossessing
manner
in
which
he
had
conducted
his
otherwise
very
inviting
affairs
second
period
the
temple
builder
two
of
years
passed
away
and
quen
still
remained
at
all
desire
of
returning
either
to
peking
or
to
the
place
of
his
birth
having
by
this
time
faded
into
nothingness
accepting
the
inevitable
fact
that
he
was
not
destined
ever
to
become
a
person
with
whom
taels
were
plentiful
and
yet
being
unwilling
to
forego
the
charitable
manner
of
life
which
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
observe
it
came
about
that
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
in
collecting
together
such
sums
of
money
as
he
could
procure
from
the
amiable
and
and
with
them
building
temples
and
engaging
in
other
benevolent
works
from
this
cause
it
arose
the
quen
obtained
around
a
reputation
for
piety
in
no
degree
less
than
that
which
had
been
conferred
upon
him
in
earlier
times
so
that
pilgrims
from
far
distant
places
would
purposely
contrive
their
journey
so
as
to
pass
through
the
town
containing
so
unassuming
and
virtuous
a
person
this
entire
period
quen
had
been
accompanied
by
his
only
son
a
youth
of
respectful
personality
in
whose
entertaining
society
he
took
an
intelligent
interest
even
when
deeply
engaged
in
what
he
justly
regarded
as
the
crowning
work
of
his
existence
the
planning
and
erecting
of
an
exceptionally
marble
temple
which
was
to
be
entirely
covered
on
the
outside
with
silver
paper
and
on
the
inside
with
he
did
not
fail
to
observe
the
various
conditions
of
existence
and
the
changing
emotions
which
from
time
to
time
possessed
him
therefore
when
the
person
in
question
without
displaying
any
signs
of
internal
sickness
and
likewise
persistently
denying
that
he
had
lost
any
considerable
sum
of
money
disclosed
a
continuous
habit
of
turning
aside
with
an
unaffected
expression
of
distaste
from
all
manner
of
food
and
passed
the
entire
night
in
observing
the
course
of
the
great
rather
than
in
sleep
the
sage
and
discriminating
quen
took
him
one
day
aside
and
asked
him
as
one
who
might
aid
him
in
the
matter
who
the
maiden
was
and
what
class
and
position
her
father
occupied
exclaimed
liao
with
many
unfeigned
manifestations
of
an
unbearable
fate
what
degree
do
the
class
and
position
of
her
entirely
unnecessary
parents
affect
the
question
or
how
little
hope
can
this
sacrilegious
one
reasonably
have
of
ever
progressing
as
far
as
earthly
details
of
a
pecuniary
character
in
the
case
of
so
adorable
and
a
being
the
uttermost
extent
of
this
ambition
is
that
when
the
incomparably
symmetrical
learns
of
the
steadfast
light
of
his
devotion
she
may
be
inspired
to
deposit
an
emblematic
chrysanthemum
upon
his
tomb
in
the
family
temple
for
such
a
reward
he
will
cheerfully
devote
the
unswerving
fidelity
of
a
lifetime
to
her
service
not
distressing
her
gentle
and
retiring
nature
by
the
expression
of
what
must
inevitably
be
a
hopeless
passion
but
patiently
and
uncomplainingly
guarding
her
footsteps
as
from
a
in
this
manner
made
aware
of
the
reason
of
frequent
and
unrestrained
exclamations
of
intolerable
despair
and
of
his
fixed
determination
with
regard
to
the
maiden
which
seemed
above
all
else
to
indicate
a
resolution
to
shun
her
presence
quen
could
not
regard
the
actions
of
his
son
with
anything
but
an
emotion
of
confusion
for
when
his
eyes
next
rested
upon
the
exceedingly
contradictory
liao
he
was
seated
in
the
open
space
before
the
house
in
which
dwelt
playing
upon
an
instrument
of
stringed
woods
and
chanting
verses
into
which
the
names
of
the
two
persons
in
question
had
been
skilfully
introduced
without
restraint
his
whole
manner
of
behaving
being
with
the
evident
purpose
of
attracting
the
favourable
attention
after
an
absence
of
many
days
spent
in
this
graceful
and
complimentary
manner
liao
returned
suddenly
to
the
house
of
his
father
and
prostrating
his
body
before
him
made
a
specific
request
for
his
assistance
regards
and
myself
he
continued
things
are
arranged
and
but
for
the
unfortunate
coincidence
of
this
poverty
and
of
her
cupidity
the
details
of
the
wedding
ceremony
would
undoubtedly
now
be
in
a
very
advanced
condition
upon
these
entrancing
and
plans
however
the
shadow
of
the
grasping
and
commonplace
has
fallen
like
the
inopportune
from
the
mouth
of
a
person
examining
substances
of
an
explosive
nature
for
the
one
referred
to
demands
a
large
and
utterly
unobtainable
amount
of
taels
before
he
will
suffer
his
daughter
to
accept
the
gifts
of
irretrievable
indeed
is
your
plight
replied
quen
when
he
thus
understood
the
manner
of
obstacle
which
impeded
his
hopes
in
the
nature
of
taels
the
most
diverse
men
are
to
be
measured
through
the
same
mesh
as
the
proverb
says
money
is
evil
exclaimed
the
philosopher
with
extreme
weariness
as
he
gathered
up
the
gold
pieces
in
exchange
but
presently
discovering
that
one
among
them
was
such
indeed
as
he
had
described
he
rushed
forth
without
tarrying
to
take
up
a
street
garment
and
with
an
entire
absence
of
dignity
traversed
all
the
ways
of
the
city
in
the
hope
of
finding
the
one
who
had
defrauded
well
does
this
person
know
the
mercenary
and
the
unyielding
nature
of
his
closed
hand
for
often
but
always
fruitlessly
he
has
entered
his
presence
on
affairs
connected
with
the
erecting
of
certain
temples
nevertheless
the
matter
is
one
which
does
not
admit
of
any
incapable
faltering
to
which
end
this
one
will
seek
out
the
obdurate
without
delay
and
endeavour
to
entrap
him
by
some
means
in
the
course
of
the
time
of
his
earliest
youth
had
unceasingly
devoted
himself
to
the
object
of
getting
together
an
overwhelming
number
of
taels
using
for
this
purpose
various
means
which
without
being
really
degrading
or
contrary
to
the
written
law
were
not
such
as
might
have
been
cheerfully
engaged
in
by
a
person
of
honourableness
in
consequence
of
this
as
he
grew
more
feeble
in
body
and
more
venerable
in
appearance
he
began
to
express
frequent
and
bitter
doubts
as
to
whether
his
manner
of
life
had
been
really
well
arranged
for
in
spite
of
his
great
wealth
he
had
grown
to
adopt
a
most
inexpensive
habit
on
all
occasions
having
no
desire
to
spend
and
an
apprehension
began
to
possess
him
that
after

disinclined

to
keep
him

in
such
a
state
of
mind

when
appeared
before
him

just
been
revealed
to
him
that
his
eldest
and
favourite
son
had
by
flattery
and
by
openly
praising
the
dexterity
with
which
he
used
his
brush
and
ink
entrapped
him
into
inscribing
his
entire
name
upon
certain
unwritten
sheets
of
parchment
which
the
one
in
question
immediately
sold
to
such
as
were
heavily
indebted
to
a
person
can
be
guilty
of
this
really
unfilial
behaviour
during
the
lifetime
of
his
father

in
a
tone
of
unrestrained
vexation
it

prudently
relied
upon
that
he
will
carry
out
his
wishes
after
death

they
involve
the
remitting

him

several
thousand
taels

immeasurably
superior

variety
of
sumptuous

the
reward
of
your
untiring
charitable
exertions

on

spirit
of
this

be
engaged

doing
menial
servitude
for
the
inferior
deities

perhaps
scarcely
able

by
those

to

according

changing
nature
of

destitute
of
cheerfulness

unbecoming
intrusiveness

in
no

rather
regarded
as
examples
of
deliberate
presumptuousness

made
the
excuse
for
subjecting
him
to
more
severe
tortures
and
acts
of
penance
than
would
be
his
portion
if
he
neglected
the
custom

is
the
case

on
that
account
it
would

a
most
regrettable
want
of
foresight
for
you
to
conduct
your
affairs
in
the
manner

the
only
undeniably
safe
course
is
for
you
to
entrust
the
amount

will
require
to
a
person
of
exceptional
piety

in

written
word
to
repay
the
full
sum

you
shall
claim
it
from

crafty
method

be
placed
at
the
disposal
of

impressed
with
this
ingenious
scheme
was
that
he
would
at
once
have
entered
more
fully
into
the
detail
had
the
thought
not
arisen
in
his
mind
that
the
person
before
him
was
the
father
of
liao
who
urgently
required
a
certain
large
sum
and
that
for
this
reason
he
might
with
prudence
inquire
more
fully
into
the
matter
elsewhere
in
case
quen
himself
should
have
been
imperceptibly
led
aside
even
though
he
possessed
intentions
of
a
most
unswerving
honourableness
to
this
end
therefore
he
desired
to
converse
again
with
quen
on
the
matter
pleading
that
at
that
moment
a
gathering
of
those
who
direct
enterprises
of
a
commercial
nature
required
his
presence
nevertheless
he
would
not
permit
the
person
referred
to
to
depart
until
he
had
complimented
him
in
both
general
and
specific
terms
on
the
high
character
of
his
life
and
actions
and
the
intelligent
nature
of
his
understanding
which
had
enabled
him
with
so
little
mental
exertion
to
discover
an
efficient
plan
delay
sought
out
those
most
skilled
in
all
varieties
of
in
extorting
money
by
devices
capable
of
very
different
meanings
and
in
expedients
for
evading
just
debts
but
all
agreed
that
such
an
arrangement
as
the
one
he
put
before
them
would
be
unavoidably
binding
provided
the
person
who
received
the
money
alluded
to
spent
it
in
the
exercise
of
his
charitable
desires
and
provided
also
that
the
written
agreement
bore
the
duty
seal
of
the
high
ones
at
peking
and
was
deposited
in
the
coffin
of
the
lender
fully
satisfied
and
rejoicing
greatly
that
he
could
in
this
way
adequately
provide
for
his
future
and
entrap
the
avaricious
ones
of
his
house
collected
together
the
greater
part
of
his
possessions
and
converting
it
into
pieces
of
gold
entrusted
them
to
quen
on
the
exact
understanding
that
has
already
been
described

receiving
in
turn
written
and
paper
of
repayment
and
his
assurance
that
the
whole
amount
should
be
expended
upon
the
and
temple
with
which
he
was
still
engaged
is
owing
to
this
circumstance
that
irreproachable
name
has
come
to
be
lightly
regarded
by
many
who
may
be
fitly
likened
to
the
latter
person
in
the
subtle
and
experienced
proverb
wise
eyes
fell
before
the
gaze
of
the
fool
fearing
that

must
cry
aloud

the
fool
to
himself
this
power
these
badly
educated
and
undiscriminating
persons
being
entirely
unable
to
explain
the
ensuing
train
of
events
unhesitatingly
declare
that
applied
a
portion
of
the
money
which
he
had
received
from
in
the
manner
described
to
the
object
of
acquiring
for
his
son
liao
in
this
feeble
and
incapable
fashion
they
endeavour
to
stigmatize
the
quen
as
one
who
acted
directly
contrary
to
his
deliberately
spoken
word
whereas
the
desired
result
was
brought
about
in
a
much
more
artful
manner
they
describe
the
commercially
successful
as
a
person
of
very
inferior
prudence
and
one
easily
imposed
upon
while
they
entirely
pass
over
as
a
detail
outside
the
true
facts
the
written
paper
preserved
among
the
sacred
relics
in
the
temple
which
announces
among
other
gifts
of
a
small
and
uninviting
character
thousand
taels
from
an
elderly
ginseng
merchant
of
who
desires
to
remain
nameless
through
the
hand
of
the
full
happening
in
its
real
and
harmless
face

now
set
forth
for
the
first
time
weeks
after
the
recorded
arrangement
had
been
arrived
at

when
the
taels
in
question
had
been
expended
upon
the
temple
and
were
therefore
infallibly
beyond
recall
the
former
person
chanced
to
be
passing
through
the
public
garden
in
when
he
heard
a
voice
lifted
up
in
the
expression
of
every
unendurable
feeling
of
dejection
to
which
one
can
give
utterance
stepping
aside
to
learn
the
cause
of
so
unprepossessing
a
display
of
unrestrained
agitation
and
in
the
hope
that
perhaps
he
might
be
able
to
use
the
incident
in
a
remunerative
manner
quickly
discovered
the
unhappy
being
who
entirely
regardless
of
the
embroidered
silk
robe
which
he
wore
reclined
upon
a
raised
bank
of
uninviting
earth
and
waved
his
hands
from
side
to
side
as
his
internal
emotions
urged
him
exclaimed
not
fully
convinced
that
the
fact
was
as
he
stated
it
in
spite
of
the
image
clearly
impressed
upon
his
imagination
what
unpropitious
occurrence
is
so
an
exhibition
due
are
those
who
traffic
in
demanding
a
high
and
prohibitive
price
for
that
commodity
or
has
some
evil
and
vindicative
spirit
taken
up
its
abode
within
the
completed
portion
of
the
temple
and
by
its
offensive
but
nevertheless
diverting
remarks
and
actions
removed
all
semblance
of
gravity
from
the
countenances
of
those
who
daily
come
to
admire
the
construction
thrice
unfortunate
replied
quen
when
he
observed
the
distinguishing
marks
of
the
person
before
him
can
this
greatly
overwhelmed
one
raise
his
eyes
to
your
open
and
intelligent
countenance
for
through
him
you
are
on
the
point
of
experiencing
a
very
severe
financial
blow
and
it
is
indeed
on
your
account
more
than
on
his
own
that
he
is
now
indulging
in
these
outward
signs
of
a
grief
too
far
down
to
be
expressed
in
spoken
and
at
the
memory
of
his
former
occupation

again
waved
his
arms
from
side
to
side
with
untiring
assiduousness
indeed
to
this
ears
are
your
words
said
outwardly
unmoved
but
with
an
apprehensive
internal
pain
that
he
would
have
regarded
display
of
emotion
with
an
easier
stomach
if
his
own
taels
were
safely
concealed
under
the
floor
of
his
inner
chamber

which
this
one
entrusted
to
you
has
without
any
pretence
been
expended
upon
the
temple
while
the
written
paper
concerning
the
repayment
bears
the
duty
seal
of
the
high
ones
at
peking
how
then
can
suffer
a
loss
at
the
hands
of
said
quen
with
every
appearance
of
desiring
that
both
persons
should
regard
the
matter
in
a
conciliatory
spirit
not
permit
the
awaiting
demons
which
are
ever
on
the
alert
to
enter
into
a
mind
when
he
becomes
distressed
out
of
the
common
order
of
events
to
take
possession
of
your
usually
discriminating
faculties
until
you
have
fully
understood
how
this
affair
has
come
about
it
is
no
unknown
thing
for
a
person
of
even
exceptional
intelligence
to
reverse
his
entire
manner
of
living
towards
the
end
of
a
long
and
consistent
existence
the
and
not
himself
has
already
done
so
in
a
similar
but
entirely
contrary
manner
the
person
who
is
now
before
you
finds
himself
impelled
towards
that
which
will
certainly
bear
a
very
unpresentable
face
when
the
circumstances
become
known
yet
by
no
other
means
is
he
capable
of
attaining
his
to
what
end
does
that
trend
demanded
in
no
degree
understanding
how
the
matter
affected
him
occupied
with
enterprises
which
those
of
an
engaging
and
complimentary
nature
are
accustomed
to
refer
to
as
charitable
this
person
has
almost
entirely
neglected
a
duty
of
scarcely
less
importance
that
of
establishing
an
unending
line
through
which
his
name
and
actions
shall
be
kept
alive
to
all
time
replied
quen
now
inquired
into
the
matter
he
finds
that
his
only
son
through
whom
alone
the
desired
result
can
be
obtained
has
become
unbearably
attached
to
a
maiden
for
whom
a
very
large
sum
is
demanded
in
exchange
the
thought
of
obtaining
no
advantage
from
an
entire
life
of
is
certainly
unprepossessing
in
the
extreme
but
so
even
to
a
more
advanced
degree
is
the
certainty
that
otherwise
the
family
monuments
will
be
untended
and
the
temple
of
domestic
virtues
become
an
early
ruin
this
person
has
submitted
the
dilemma
to
the
test
of
omens
and
after
considering
well
the
reply
he
has
decided
to
obtain
the
price
of
the
maiden
in
a
not
very
honourable
manner
which
now
presents
itself
so
that
liao
may
send
out
his
gifts
without

an
unalluring
alternative
said
whose
only
inside
thought
was
one
of
gratification
that
the
exchange
money
for
would
so
soon
be
in
his
possession
this
person
fails
to
perceive
how
you
could
act
otherwise
after
the
decision
of
the
omens
he
now
understands
moreover
that
the
loss
you
referred
to
on
his
part
was
in
the
nature
of
a
figure
of
speech
as
one
makes
use
of
thunderbolts
and
flowers
to
convey
ideas
of
harsh
and
amiable
passions
and
alluded
in
reality
to
the
forthcoming
departure
of
his
daughter
who
is
as
you
so
versatilely
suggested
the
comfort
and
riches
of
his
old
venerable
but
at
this
moment
somewhat
obtuse
cried
quen
with
a
recurrence
to
his
former
method
of
expressing
his
unfeigned
agitation

mind
unable
to
grasp
the
essential
fact
of
how
this
contemplated
action
will
affect
your
own
celestial
condition
it
is
a
distressing
but
entirely
unavoidable
fact
that
if
this
person
acts
in
the
manner
which
he
has
determined
upon
he
will
be
condemned
to
the
lowest
place
of
torment
reserved
for
those
who
fail
at
the
end
of
an
otherwise
pure
existence
and
in
this
he
will
never
have
an
opportunity
of
meeting
the
very
much
higher
placed
and
of
restoring
to
him
the
taels
as
agreed
these
words
all
power
of
rigidness
departed
from
limbs
and
he
sank
down
upon
the
forbidding
earth
by
side
most
unfortunate
one
who
is
now
speaking
he
exclaimed
when
at
length
his
guarding
spirit
deemed
it
prudent
to
restore
his
power
of
expressing
himself
in
words

would
have
been
your
lot

other
commodities

entrancing
paths

habitual
virtue

not
the
very
reasonable

to
look
favourably
upon
the
attractions

some
maiden

be
willing
to
advance

and
unremunerative
rate

observed
every
variety
of
practical
humility
in
the
course

his
life

with
commendable
dignity

now
finds
himself
totally
unable
to
overcome
an
inward
repugnance

perpetuating
his
honoured
name

medium

his
consistent
habit

forming
an
opinion
quickly

others
hesitated

only
engaged
his
mind
with
the
opposing
circumstances

a
few
moments
before

definitely
fixed
upon
the
course

he
should
pursue

an
evident
intermingling

many
very
conflicting
emotions

is
often
enabled
to
conquer
when
opposed
to
an
otherwise
overwhelming
multitude
in
all
these
accomplishments
quang
excelled
to
an
exceptional
degree
for
although
unprepossessing
in
appearance
he
united
matchless
strength
to
an
untiring
subtlety
no
other
person
in
the
entire
province
of
could
hurl
a
javelin
so
unerringly
while
uttering
sounds
of
terrifying
menace
or
could
cause
his
sword
to
revolve
around
him
so
rapidly
while
his
face
looked
out
from
the
glittering
circles
with
an
expression
of
malignity
that
never
failed
to
inspire
his
adversary
with
irrepressible
emotions
of
alarm
no
other
person
could
so
successfully
feign
to
be
devoid
of
life
for
almost
any
length
of
time
or
by
his
manner
of
behaving
create
the
fixed
impression
that
he
was
one
of
insufficient
understanding
and
therefore
harmless
it
was
for
these
reasons
that
quang
was
chosen
as
the
instructor
of
yin
by
yat
huang
who
without
possessing
any
official
degree
was
a
person
to
whom
marks
of
obeisance
were
paid
not
only
within
his
own
town
but
for
a
distance
of
many
li
around
it
at
length
the
time
arrived
when
yin
would
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
pass
from
the
instructorship
of
quang
in
order
to
devote
himself
to
the
commerce
in
which
his
father
was
engaged
and
from
time
to
time
the
unavoidable
thought
arose
persistently
within
his
mind
that
although
yat
huang
doubtless
knew
better
than
he
did
what
the
circumstances
of
the
future
required
yet
his
manner
of
life
for
the
past
years
was
not
such
that
he
could
contemplate
engaging
in
the
occupation
of
buying
and
selling
porcelain
clay
with
feelings
of
an
overwhelming
interest
quang
however
maintained
with
every
manifestation
of
inspired
assurance
that
yat
huang
was
to
be
commended
down
to
the
smallest
detail
inasmuch
as
proficiency
in
the
use
of
both
blunt
and
weapons
and
a
faculty
for
passing
undetected
through
the
midst
of
an
encamped
body
of
foemen
fitted
a
person
for
the
affairs
of
life
above
all
other
accomplishments
doubt
the
very
accomplished
yat
huan
is
well
advised
on
this
point
continued
quang
even
this
mentally
person
can
call
up
within
his
understanding
numerous
specific
incidents
in
the
ordinary
career
of
one
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
porcelain
clay
when
such
attainments
would
be
of
great
remunerative
benefit
does
the
yin
think
for
example
that
even
the
most
depraved
person
would
endeavour
to
gain
an
advantage
over
him
in
the
matter
of
buying
or
selling
porcelain
clay
if
he
fully
understood
the
fact
that
the
one
with
whom
he
was
trafficking
could
unhesitatingly
transfix
four
persons
with
one
arrow
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
paces
or
to
what
advantage
would
it
be
that
a
body
of
unscrupulous
outcasts
who
owned
a
field
of
inferior
clay
should
surround
it
with
drawn
swords
by
day
and
night
endeavouring
meanwhile
to
dispose
of
it
as
material
of
the
finest
quality
if
the
one
whom
they
endeavoured
to
ensnare
in
this
manner
possessed
the
power
of
being
able
to
pass
through
their
ranks
unseen
and
examine
the
clay
at
his
leisure
the
cases
to
which
reference
has
been
made
the
possession
of
those
qualities
would
undoubtedly
be
of
considerable
use
admitted
yin
in
spite
of
his
entire
ignorance
of
commercial
matters
this
one
has
a
confident
feeling
that
it
would
be
more
profitable
to
avoid
such
very
doubtful
forms
of
barter
altogether
rather
than
spend
eight
years
in
acquiring
the
arts
by
which
to
defeat
them
that
however
is
a
question
which
concerns
this
virtuous
and
engaging
father
more
than
his
unworthy
self
and
his
only
regret
is
that
no
opportunity
has
offered
by
which
he
might
prove
that
he
has
applied
himself
diligently
to
your
instruction
and
example
o
amiable
it
had
long
been
a
regret
to
quang
also
that
no
incident
of
a
disturbing
nature
had
arisen
whereby
yin
could
have
shown
himself
proficient
in
the
methods
of
defence
and
attack
which
he
had
taught
him
this
deficiency
he
had
endeavoured
to
overcome
as
far
as
possible
by
constructing
models
of
all
the
most
powerful
and
ferocious
types
of
warriors
and
the
fiercest
and
most
relentless
animals
of
the
forest
so
that
yin
might
become
familiar
with
their
appearance
and
discover
in
what
manner
each
could
be
the
most
expeditiously
engaged
remarked
quang
on
an
occasion
when
yin
appeared
to
be
covered
with
honourable
pride
at
having
approached
an
unusually
large
and
tiger
so
stealthily
that
had
the
animal
been
really
alive
it
would
certainly
have
failed
to
perceive
him
accomplishments
are
by
no
means
to
be
regarded
as
conclusive
in
themselves
to
steal
insidiously
upon
a
wild
beast
and
transfix
it
with
one
blow
of
a
spear
is
attended
by
difficulties
and
emotions
which
are
entirely
absent
in
the
case
of
a
wickerwork
animal
covered
with
no
matter
how
deceptive
in
appearance
the
latter
may
to
afford
yin
a
more
trustworthy
example
of
how
he
should
engage
with
an
adversary
of
formidable
proportions
quang
resolved
upon
an
ingenious
plan
procuring
the
skin
of
a
grey
wolf
he
concealed
himself
within
it
and
in
the
early
morning
while
the
was
still
upon
the
ground
he
set
forth
to
meet
yin
who
had
on
a
previous
occasion
spoken
to
him
of
his
intention
to
be
at
a
certain
spot
at
such
an
hour
in
this
conscientious
enterprise
the
painstaking
quang
would
doubtless
have
been
successful
and
yin
gained
an
assured
proficiency
and
experience
had
it
not
chanced
that
on
the
journey
quang
encountered
a
labourer
of
low
caste
who
was
crossing
the
enclosed
ground
on
his
way
to
the
rice
field
in
which
he
worked
this
contemptible
and
inopportune
person
not
having
at
any
period
of
his
existence
perfected
himself
in
the
recognized
and
elegant
methods
of
attack
and
defence
did
not
act
in
the
manner
which
would
assuredly
have
been
adopted
by
yin
in
similar
circumstances
and
for
which
quang
would
have
been
fully
prepared
on
the
contrary
without
the
least
indication
of
what
his
intention
was
he
suddenly
struck
quang
who
was
hesitating
for
a
moment
what
action
to
take
a
most
intolerable
blow
with
a
formidable
staff
which
he
carried
the
stroke
in
question
inflicted
itself
upon
quang
upon
that
part
of
the
body
where
the
head
becomes
connected
with
the
neck
and
would
certainly
have
been
followed
by
others
of
equal
force
and
precision
had
not
quang
in
the
meantime
decided
that
the
most
dignified
course
for
him
to
adopt
would
be
to
disclose
his
name
and
titles
without
delay
upon
learning
these
facts
the
one
who
stood
before
him
became
very
grossly
and
offensively
amused
and
having
taken
from
quang
everything
of
value
which
he
carried
among
his
garments
went
on
his
way
leaving
instructor
to
retrace
his
steps
in
unendurable
dejection
as
he
then
found
that
he
possessed
no
further
interest
whatever
in
the
undertaking
when
yat
huang
was
satisfied
that
his
son
was
sufficiently
skilled
in
the
various
arts
of
warfare
he
called
him
to
his
inner
chamber
and
having
barred
the
door
securely
he
placed
yin
under
a
very
binding
oath
not
to
reveal
until
an
appointed
period
the
matter
which
he
was
going
to
put
before
him
father
to
son
in
unbroken
line
for
ten
generations
has
such
a
custom
been
observed
he
said
the
course
of
events
is
not
to
be
lightly
entered
upon
at
the
commencement
of
that
cycle
which
period
is
now
fully
fifteen
score
years
ago
a
very
wise
person
chanced
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
emperor
of
that
time
and
being
in
consequence
driven
out
of
the
capital
he
fled
to
the
mountains
there
his
subtle
discernment
and
the
pure
and
solitary
existence
which
he
led
resulted
in
his
becoming
endowed
with
faculties
beyond
those
possessed
by
ordinary
beings
when
he
felt
the
end
of
his
earthly
career
to
be
at
hand
he
descended
into
the
plain
where
in
a
state
of
great
destitution
and
bodily
anguish
he
was
discovered
by
the
one
whom
this
person
has
referred
to
as
the
first
of
the
line
of
ancestors
in
return
for
the
care
and
hospitality
with
which
he
was
unhesitatingly
received
the
admittedly
inspired
hermit
spent
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
determining
the
destinies
of
his
family
and
posterity
it
is
an
undoubted
fact
that
he
predicted
how
one
would
by
enterprise
and
adventure
rise
to
a
position
of
such
eminence
in
the
land
that
he
counselled
the
details
to
be
kept
secret
lest
the
envy
and
hostility
of
the
ambitious
and
unworthy
should
be
raised
from
this
cause
it
has
been
customary
to
reveal
the
matter
fully
from
father
to
son
at
stated
periods
and
the
setting
out
of
the
particulars
in
written
words
has
been
severely
discouraged
wise
as
this
precaution
certainly
was
it
has
resulted
in
a
very
inconvenient
state
of
things
for
a
remote
ancestor
the
fifth
in
line
from
the
beginning
experienced
such
vicissitudes
that
he
returned
from
his
travels
in
a
state
of
most
abandoned
idiocy
and
when
the
time
arrived
that
he
should
in
turn
communicate
to
his
son
he
was
only
able
to
repeat
over
and
over
again
the
name
of
the
pious
hermit
to
whom
the
family
was
so
greatly
indebted
coupling
it
each
time
with
a
new
and
markedly
offensive
epithet
the
essential
details
of
the
undertaking
having
in
this
manner
passed
beyond
recall
succeeding
generations
which
were
merely
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
a
very
prosperous
future
awaited
the
one
who
fulfilled
the
conditions
have
in
vain
attempted
to
conform
to
them
it
is
not
an
alluring
undertaking
inasmuch
as
nothing
of
the
method
to
be
pursued
can
be
learned
except
that
it
was
the
custom
of
the
early
ones
who
held
the
full
knowledge
to
set
out
from
home
and
return
after
a
period
of
years
yet
so
clearly
expressed
was
the
prophecy
and
so
great
the
reward
of
the
successful
that
all
have
eagerly
journeyed
forth
when
the
time
came
knowing
nothing
beyond
that
which
this
person
has
now
unfolded
to
when
yat
huang
reached
the
end
of
the
matter
which
it
was
his
duty
to
disclose
yin
for
some
time
pondered
the
circumstances
before
replying
in
spite
of
a
most
engaging
reverence
for
everything
of
a
sacred
nature
he
could
not
consider
the
inspired
remark
of
the
hermit
without
feelings
of
a
most
persistent
doubt
for
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
the
person
in
question
had
really
been
as
wise
as
he
was
represented
to
be
he
might
reasonably
have
been
expected
to
avoid
the
unaccountable
error
of
offending
the
enlightened
and
powerful
emperor
under
whom
he
lived
nevertheless
the
prospect
of
engaging
in
the
trade
of
porcelain
clay
was
less
attractive
in
his
eyes
than
that
of
setting
forth
upon
a
journey
of
adventure
so
that
at
length
he
expressed
his
willingness
to
act
after
the
manner
of
those
who
had
gone
before
him
this
decision
was
received
by
yat
huang
with
an
equal
intermingling
of
the
feelings
of
delight
and
concern
for
although
he
would
have
by
no
means
pleasurably
contemplated
yin
breaking
through
a
venerable
and
esteemed
custom
he
was
unable
to
put
entirely
from
him
the
thought
of
the
degrading
fate
which
had
overtaken
the
fifth
in
line
who
made
the
venture
it
was
indeed
to
guard
yin
as
much
as
possible
against
the
dangers
to
which
he
would
become
exposed
if
he
determined
on
the
expedition
that
the
entire
course
of
his
training
had
been
selected
in
order
that
no
precaution
of
a
propitious
nature
should
be
neglected
yat
huang
at
once
despatched
written
words
of
welcome
to
all
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
bidding
them
partake
of
a
great
banquet
which
he
was
preparing
to
mark
the
occasion
of
his
every
variety
of
sacrifice
was
offered
up
to
the
controlling
deities
both
good
and
bad
the
ten
ancestors
were
continuously
exhorted
to
take
yin
under
their
special
protection
and
sets
of
verses
recording
his
virtues
and
ambitions
were
freely
distributed
among
the
necessitous
and
who
could
not
be
received
at
the
feast
the
dinner
itself
exceeded
in
magnificence
any
similar
event
that
had
ever
taken
place
in
so
great
was
the
polished
ceremony
observed
on
the
occasion
that
each
guest
had
half
a
score
of
cups
of
the
finest
successively
placed
before
him
and
taken
away
untasted
while
yat
huang
went
to
each
in
turn
protesting
vehemently
that
the
honour
of
covering
such
and
distinguished
persons
was
more
than
his
badly
designed
roof
could
reasonably
bear
and
wittingly
giving
an
entrancing
air
of
reality
to
the
spoken
compliment
by
begging
them
to
move
somewhat
to
one
side
so
that
they
might
escape
the
heavy
central
beam
if
the
event
which
he
alluded
to
chanced
to
take
place
after
several
hours
had
been
spent
in
this
congenial
occupation
yat
huang
proceeded
to
read
aloud
several
of
the
sixteen
discourses
on
education
which
taken
together
form
the
discriminating
and
infallible
example
of
conduct
known
as
the
holy
edict
as
each
detail
was
dwelt
upon
yin
arose
from
his
couch
and
gave
his
deliberate
testimony
that
all
the
required
tests
and
rites
had
been
observed
in
his
own
case
the
first
part
of
the
repast
was
then
partaken
of
the
nature
of
the
ingredients
and
the
manner
of
preparing
them
being
fully
explained
and
in
a
like
manner
through
each
succeeding
one
of
the
courses
at
the
conclusion
yin
again
arose
being
encouraged
by
the
repeated
uttering
of
his
name
by
those
present
and
with
extreme
modesty
and
brilliance
set
forth
his
manner
of
thinking
concerning
all
subjects
with
which
he
was
acquainted
early
on
the
morning
of
the
following
day
yin
set
out
on
his
travels
entirely
unaccompanied
and
carrying
with
him
nothing
beyond
a
sum
of
money
a
silk
robe
and
a
and
reliable
spear
for
many
days
he
journeyed
in
a
northerly
direction
without
encountering
anything
sufficiently
unusual
to
engage
his
attention
this
however
was
doubtless
part
of
a
scheme
so
that
he
should
not
be
drawn
from
a
destined
path
for
at
a
small
village
lying
on
the
southern
shore
of
a
large
lake
called
by
those
around
silent
water
he
heard
of
the
existence
of
a
certain
sacred
island
distant
a
full
sailing
which
was
barren
of
all
forms
of
living
things
and
contained
only
a
single
gigantic
rock
of
divine
origin
and
majestic
appearance
many
persons
the
villagers
asserted
had
sailed
to
the
island
in
the
hope
of
learning
the
portent
of
the
rock
but
none
ever
returned
and
they
themselves
avoided
coming
even
within
sight
of
it
for
the
sacred
stone
they
declared
exercised
an
evil
influence
over
their
ships
and
would
if
permitted
draw
them
out
of
their
course
and
towards
itself
for
this
reason
yin
could
find
no
guide
whatever
reward
he
offered
who
would
accompany
him
but
having
with
difficulty
succeeded
in
hiring
a
small
boat
of
inconsiderable
value
he
embarked
with
food
incense
and
materials
for
building
fires
and
after
rowing
consistently
for
nearly
the
whole
of
the
day
came
within
sight
of
the
island
at
evening
thereafter
the
necessity
of
further
exertion
ceased
for
as
they
of
the
village
had
declared
would
be
the
case
the
vessel
moved
gently
forward
in
an
unswerving
line
without
being
in
any
way
propelled
and
reaching
its
destination
in
a
marvellously
short
space
of
time
passed
behind
a
protecting
spur
of
land
and
came
to
rest
it
then
being
night
yin
did
no
more
than
carry
his
stores
to
a
place
of
safety
and
after
lighting
a
sacrificial
fire
and
prostrating
himself
before
the
rock
passed
into
the
middle
air
in
the
morning
spirit
came
back
to
the
earth
amid
the
sound
of
music
of
a
celestial
origin
which
ceased
immediately
he
recovered
full
consciousness
accepting
this
manifestation
as
an
omen
of
divine
favour
yin
journeyed
towards
the
centre
of
the
island
where
the
rock
stood
at
every
step
passing
the
bones
of
innumerable
ones
who
had
come
on
a
similar
quest
to
his
and
perished
many
of
these
had
left
behind
them
inscriptions
on
wood
or
bone
testifying
their
deliberate
opinion
of
the
sacred
rock
the
island
their
protecting
deities
and
the
entire
train
of
circumstances
which
had
resulted
in
their
being
in
such
a
condition
these
were
for
the
most
part
of
a
maledictory
and
unencouraging
nature
so
that
after
reading
a
few
yin
endeavoured
to
pass
without
being
in
any
degree
influenced
by
such
outbursts
be
the
ancestors
of
this
tormented
one
to
four
generations
back
was
prominently
traced
upon
an
unusually
large
they
at
this
moment
be
simmering
in
a
vat
of
unrefined
blood
as
a
reward
for
having
so
undiscriminatingly
reared
the
person
who
inscribes
these
words
only
to
attain
this
end
warned
o
later
one
by
the
signs
around
another
and
more
person
had
written
with
all
haste
to
your
vessel
and
escape
while
there
is
yet
time
should
you
by
chance
again
reach
land
through
this
warning
do
not
neglect
out
of
an
emotion
of
gratitude
to
burn
an
appropriate
amount
of
sacrifice
paper
for
the
lessening
of
the
torments
of
the
spirit
of
to
which
an
unscrupulous
one
who
was
plainly
desirous
of
sharing
in
the
benefit
of
the
requested
sacrifice
without
suffering
the
exertion
of
inscribing
a
warning
after
the
amiable
manner
of
had
added
the
words
that
of
huan
halting
at
a
convenient
distance
from
one
side
of
the
rock
which
without
being
carved
by
any
hand
naturally
resembled
the
symmetrical
countenance
of
a
recumbent
dragon
which
he
therefore
conjectured
to
be
the
chief
point
of
the
entire
mass
yin
built
his
fire
and
began
an
unremitting
course
of
sacrifice
and
respectful
ceremony
this
manner
of
conduct
he
observed
conscientiously
for
the
space
of
seven
days
towards
the
end
of
that
period
a
feeling
of
unendurable
dejection
began
to
possess
him
for
his
stores
of
all
kinds
were
beginning
to
fail
and
he
could
not
entirely
put
behind
him
the
memory
of
the
various
warnings
which
he
had
received
or
the
sight
of
the
fleshless
ones
who
had
lined
his
path
on
the
eighth
day
being
weak
with
hunger
and
by
reason
of
an
intolerable
thirst
unable
to
restrain
his
body
any
longer
in
the
spot
where
he
had
hitherto
continuously
prostrated
himself
times
each
hour
without
ceasing
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
retraced
his
steps
to
the
boat
in
order
that
he
might
fill
his
and
procure
a
further
supply
of
food
with
a
complicated
emotion
in
which
was
present
every
abandoned
and
disagreeable
thought
to
which
a
person
becomes
a
prey
in
moments
of
exceptional
mental
and
bodily
anguish
he
perceived
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
water
that
the
boat
upon
which
he
was
confidently
relying
to
carry
him
back
when
all
else
failed
had
disappeared
as
entirely
as
the
smoke
from
an
extinguished
opium
pipe
at
this
sight
yin
clearly
understood
the
meaning
of
unregarded
warning
and
recognized
that
nothing
could
now
save
him
from
adding
his
incorruptible
parts
to
those
of
the
unfortunate
ones
whose
unhappy
fate
had
seven
days
ago
engaged
his
refined
pity
unaccountably
strengthened
in
body
by
the
indignation
which
possessed
him
and
inspired
with
a
virtuous
repulsion
at
the
treacherous
manner
of
behaving
on
the
part
of
those
who
guided
his
destinies
he
hastened
back
to
his
place
of
obeisance
and
perceiving
that
the
habitually
placid
and
introspective
expression
on
the
dragon
face
had
imperceptibly
changed
into
one
of
offensive
cunning
and
unconcealed
contempt
he
snatched
up
his
spear
and
without
the
consideration
of
a
moment
hurled
it
at
a
score
of
paces
distance
full
into
the
sacred
but
nevertheless
very
unprepossessing
face
before
him
at
the
instant
when
the
presumptuous
weapon
touched
the
holy
stone
the
entire
intervening
space
between
the
earth
and
the
sky
was
filled
with
innumerable
flashes
of
forked
and
lightning
so
that
the
island
had
the
appearance
of
being
the
scene
of
a
very
extensive
but
somewhat
display
of
costly
fireworks
at
the
same
time
the
thunder
rolled
among
the
clouds
and
beneath
the
sea
in
an
exceedingly
disconcerting
manner
at
the
first
indication
of
these
celestial
movements
a
sudden
blindness
came
upon
yin
and
all
power
of
thought
or
movement
forsook
him
nevertheless
he
experienced
an
emotion
of
flight
through
the
air
as
though
borne
upwards
upon
the
back
of
a
winged
creature
when
this
emotion
ceased
the
blindness
went
from
him
as
suddenly
and
entirely
as
if
a
cloth
had
been
pulled
away
from
his
eyes
and
he
perceived
that
he
was
held
in
the
midst
of
a
boundless
space
with
no
other
object
in
view
than
the
sacred
rock
which
had
opened
as
it
were
revealing
a
mighty
throng
within
at
the
sight
of
whom
internal
organs
trembled
as
they
would
never
have
moved
at
ordinary
danger
for
it
was
put
into
his
spirit
that
these
in
whose
presence
he
stood
were
the
sacred
emperors
of
his
country
from
the
earliest
time
until
the
usurpation
of
the
chinese
throne
by
the
devouring
tartar
hordes
from
the
north
as
yin
gazed
in
amazement
a
knowledge
of
the
various
pure
ones
who
composed
the
assembly
came
upon
him
he
understood
that
the
three
unclad
and
commanding
figures
which
stood
together
were
the
emperors
of
the
heaven
earth
and
man
whose
reigns
covered
a
space
of
more
than
eighty
thousand
years
commencing
from
the
time
when
the
world
began
its
span
of
existence
next
to
them
stood
one
wearing
a
robe
of
his
hand
resting
upon
a
staff
of
a
massive
club
while
on
his
face
the
expression
of
tranquillity
which
marked
his
predecessors
had
changed
into
one
of
alert
wakefulness
it
was
the
emperor
of
houses
whose
reign
marked
the
opening
of
the
strife
between
man
and
all
other
creatures
by
his
side
stood
his
successor
the
emperor
of
fire
holding
in
his
right
hand
the
emblem
of
the
knotted
cord
by
which
he
taught
man
to
cultivate
his
mental
faculties
while
from
his
mouth
issued
smoke
and
flame
signifying
that
by
the
introduction
of
fire
he
had
raised
his
subjects
to
a
state
of
civilized
life
on
the
other
side
of
the
boundless
chamber
which
seemed
to
be
contained
within
the
rocks
were
and
huang
standing
or
reclining
together
the
first
of
these
framed
the
calendar
organized
property
thought
out
the
eight
essential
diagrams
encouraged
the
various
branches
of
hunting
and
the
rearing
of
domestic
animals
and
instituted
marriage
from
his
couch
floated
melodious
sounds
in
remembrance
of
his
discovery
of
the
property
of
stringed
woods
who
manifested
the
property
of
herbs
and
growing
plants
wore
a
robe
signifying
his
attainments
by
means
of
embroidered
symbols
his
hand
rested
on
the
head
of
the
dragon
while
at
his
feet
flowed
a
bottomless
canal
of
the
purest
water
the
discovery
of
written
letters
by
and
his
ingenious
plan
of
grouping
them
after
the
manner
of
the
constellations
of
stars
was
emblemized
in
a
similar
manner
while
huang
or
the
yellow
emperor
was
surrounded
by
ores
of
the
useful
and
precious
metals
weapons
of
warfare
written
books
silks
and
articles
of
attire
coined
money
and
a
variety
of
objects
all
testifying
to
his
ingenuity
and
inspired
energy
these
illustrious
ones
being
the
greatest
were
the
first
to
take
attention
but
beyond
them
he
beheld
an
innumerable
concourse
of
emperors
who
not
infrequently
outshone
their
majestic
predecessors
in
the
richness
of
their
apparel
and
the
magnificence
of
the
jewels
which
they
wore
there
yin
perceived
who
first
caused
the
chants
to
be
collected
and
other
rulers
of
the
tcheon
dynasty
who
compiled
the
holy
edict
thang
rulers
whose
line
is
rightly
called
golden
from
the
unsurpassed
excellence
of
the
composed
verses
which
it
produced
renowned
emperors
of
the
versatile
han
dynasty
and
standing
apart
and
shunned
by
all
the
malignant
and
who
caused
the
sacred
books
to
be
burned
even
while
yin
looked
and
wondered
in
great
fear
a
rolling
voice
coming
from
one
who
sat
in
the
midst
of
all
holding
in
his
right
hand
the
sun
and
in
his
left
the
moon
sounded
forth
like
the
music
of
many
brass
instruments
playing
in
unison
it
was
the
first
man
who
spoke
son
of
yat
huang
and
creature
of
the
lower
part
he
said
well
to
the
words
i
speak
for
brief
is
the
span
of
your
tarrying
in
the
upper
air
nor
will
the
utterance
i
now
give
forth
ever
come
unto
your
ears
again
either
on
the
earth
or
when
blindly
groping
in
the
middle
distance
your
spirit
takes
its
nightly
flight
they
who
are
gathered
around
and
whose
voices
i
speak
bid
me
say
this
although
immeasurably
above
you
in
all
matters
both
of
knowledge
and
of
power
yet
we
greet
you
as
one
who
is
and
inspired
with
honourable
ambition
had
you
been
content
to
entreat
and
despair
as
did
all
the
feeble
and
incapable
ones
whose
white
bones
formed
your
pathway
your
ultimate
fate
would
have
in
no
wise
differed
from
theirs
but
inasmuch
as
you
held
yourself
valiantly
and
being
taken
raised
an
instinctive
hand
in
return
you
have
been
chosen
for
the
day
to
mute
submission
has
for
the
time
or
for
ever
passed
away
and
the
hour
is
when
china
shall
be
saved
not
by
supplication
but
by
the
state
of
things
which
would
have
been
highly
unnecessary
if
i
had
been
permitted
to
carry
out
my
intention
fully
and
restore
man
to
his
prehistoric
simplicity
interrupted
that
reason
when
the
voice
of
the
assemblage
expresses
itself
it
must
be
understood
that
it
represents
in
no
measure
the
views
of
the
matter
of
what
has
gone
before
and
that
which
will
follow
hereafter
continued
the
voice
dispassionately
the
son
of
must
concede
that
it
is
in
no
part
the
utterance
of
who
burned
the
sacred
at
the
mention
of
the
name
and
offence
of
this
degraded
being
a
great
sound
went
up
from
the
entire
multitude
a
universal
cry
of
execration
not
greatly
dissimilar
from
that
which
may
be
frequently
heard
in
the
crowded
temple
of
impartiality
when
the
one
whose
duty
it
is
to
take
up
at
a
venture
the
folded
papers
announces
that
the
sublime
emperor
or
some
mandarin
of
exalted
rank
has
been
so
fortunate
as
to
hold
the
winning
number
in
the
annual
state
lottery
so
and
mournful
was
the
combined
and
evidently
preconcerted
wail
that
yin
was
compelled
to
shield
his
ears
against
it
yet
the
inconsiderable
on
whose
account
it
was
raised
seemed
in
no
degree
to
be
affected
by
it
he
doubtless
having
become
hardened
by
hearing
a
similar
outburst
at
fixed
hours
throughout
interminable
cycles
of
time
when
the
last
echo
of
the
cry
had
passed
away
the
voice
continued
to
speak
the
earth
will
again
receive
you
yin
it
said
it
is
not
respectful
that
a
lower
one
should
be
long
permitted
to
gaze
upon
our
exalted
faces
yet
when
you
go
forth
and
stand
once
more
among
men
this
is
laid
on
you
that
henceforth
you
are
as
a
being
devoted
to
a
fixed
and
unchanging
end
and
whatever
moves
towards
the
restoring
of
the
throne
of
the
central
empire
the
outcast
but
unalterably
sacred
line
of
its
true
sovereigns
shall
have
your
arm
and
mind
by
what
combination
of
force
and
stratagem
this
can
be
accomplished
may
not
be
honourably
revealed
by
us
the
nevertheless
omens
and
guidance
shall
not
be
lacking
from
time
to
time
and
from
the
beginning
the
weapon
by
which
you
have
attained
to
this
distinction
shall
be
as
a
sign
of
our
favour
and
protection
over
when
the
voice
made
an
end
of
speaking
the
sudden
blindness
came
upon
yin
as
it
had
done
before
and
from
the
sense
of
motion
which
he
experienced
he
conjectured
that
he
was
being
conveyed
back
to
the
island
undoubtedly
this
was
the
case
for
presently
there
came
upon
him
the
feeling
that
he
was
awakening
from
a
deep
and
refreshing
sleep
and
opening
his
eyes
which
he
now
found
himself
able
to
do
without
any
difficulty
he
immediately
discovered
that
he
was
reclining
at
full
length
on
the
ground
and
at
a
distance
of
about
a
score
of
paces
from
the
dragon
head
his
first
thought
was
to
engage
in
a
lengthy
course
of
before
it
but
remembering
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
to
him
while
in
the
upper
air
he
refrained
and
even
ventured
to
go
forward
with
a
confident
but
somewhat
air
to
regain
the
spear
which
he
perceived
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
with
feelings
of
a
reassuring
nature
he
then
saw
that
the
very
undesirable
expression
which
he
had
last
beheld
upon
the
dragon
face
had
melted
into
one
of
encouraging
urbanity
and
benignant
esteem
close
by
the
place
where
he
had
landed
he
discovered
his
boat
newly
furnished
with
wine
and
food
of
a
much
more
attractive
profusion
than
that
which
he
had
purchased
in
the
village
embarking
in
it
he
made
as
though
he
would
have
returned
to
the
south
but
the
spear
which
he
held
turned
within
his
grasp
and
pointed
in
an
exactly
opposite
direction
regarding
this
fact
as
an
express
command
on
the
part
of
the
deities
yin
turned
his
boat
to
the
north
and
in
the
space
of
two
time
being
continually
guided
by
the
fixed
indication
of
the
spear
he
reached
the
shore
and
prepared
to
continue
his
travels
in
the
same
direction
upheld
and
inspired
by
the
knowledge
that
henceforth
he
moved
under
the
direct
influence
of
very
powerful
spirits
ix
the
destiny
of
kin
yen
the
as
recorded
by
himself
before
his
sudden
departure
from
peking
owing
to
circumstances
which
are
made
plain
in
the
following
narrative
there
are
moments
in
the
life
of
a
person
when
the
saying
of
the
wise
that
comes
to
all
men
and
to
most
is
endowed
with
double
force
at
such
times
the
faithful
child
of
the
sun
is
a
prey
to
the
whitest
and
most
funereal
thoughts
and
even
the
inspired
wisdom
of
his
illustrious
ancestors
seems
more
than
doubtful
while
the
continued
inactivity
of
the
sacred
dragon
appears
for
the
time
to
give
colour
to
the
scoffs
of
the
western
barbarian
a
little
while
ago
these
misgivings
would
have
found
no
in
the
bosom
of
the
writer
now
however
but
the
matter
must
be
made
clear
from
the
beginning
the
name
of
the
despicable
person
who
here
sets
forth
his
immature
story
is
kin
yen
and
he
is
a
native
of
in
the
province
of
having
purchased
from
a
very
aged
man
the
position
of
hereditary
instructor
in
the
art
of
drawing
birds
and
flowers
he
gave
lessons
in
these
accomplishments
until
he
had
saved
sufficient
money
to
journey
to
peking
here
it
was
his
presumptuous
intention
to
learn
the
art
of
drawing
figures
in
order
that
he
might
illustrate
printed
leaves
of
a
more
distinguished
class
than
those
which
would
accept
what
true
politeness
compels
him
to
call
his
exceedingly
unsymmetrical
pictures
of
birds
and
flowers
accordingly
when
the
time
arrived
he
disposed
of
his
hereditary
instructorship
having
first
ascertained
in
the
interests
of
his
pupils
that
his
successor
was
a
person
of
refined
morals
and
great
filial
piety
alas
it
is
well
written
road
to
eminence
lies
through
the
cheap
and
exceedingly
uninviting
in
spite
of
this
great
economy
and
of
his
having
begged
his
way
from
to
peking
in
the
guise
of
a
pilgrim
journeying
to
burn
incense
in
the
sacred
temple
of
truth
near
that
city
when
once
within
the
latter
place
his
taels
melted
away
like
the
smile
of
a
person
of
low
class
when
he
discovers
that
the
stern
words
were
not
intended
as
a
jest
moreover
he
found
that
the
of
peking
receiving
higher
rewards
than
those
at
considered
themselves
bound
to
introduce
living
characters
into
all
their
tales
and
in
consequence
the
very
ornamental
drawings
of
birds
and
flowers
which
he
had
entwined
into
a
legend
entitled
last
fight
of
the
a
story
which
had
been
entrusted
to
him
for
illustration
as
a
test
of
his
skill
was
returned
to
him
with
a
communication
in
which
the
writer
revealed
his
real
meaning
by
stating
contrary
facts
it
therefore
became
necessary
that
he
should
become
competent
in
the
art
of
drawing
figures
without
delay
and
with
this
object
he
called
at
the
of
tieng
lin
a
person
whose
experience
was
so
great
that
he
could
without
discomfort
to
himself
draw
men
and
women
of
all
classes
both
good
and
bad
when
the
person
who
is
setting
forth
this
narrative
revealed
to
tieng
lin
the
utmost
amount
of
money
he
could
afford
to
give
for
instruction
in
the
art
of
drawing
living
figures
tieng
face
became
as
overcast
as
the
sky
immediately
before
the
great
rains
for
in
his
ignorance
of
this
incapable
poverty
he
had
treated
him
with
equality
and
courtesy
nor
had
he
kept
him
waiting
in
the
mean
room
on
the
plea
that
he
was
at
that
moment
closeted
with
the
sacred
emperor
however
upon
receiving
an
assurance
that
a
rumour
would
be
spread
in
which
the
number
of
taels
should
be
multiplied
by
ten
and
that
the
sum
itself
should
be
brought
in
advance
tieng
lin
promised
to
instruct
this
person
in
the
art
of
drawing
five
characters
which
he
said
would
be
sufficient
to
illustrate
all
stories
except
those
by
the
most
expensive
and
men
who
have
become
so
proficient
that
they
not
infrequently
introduce
a
score
or
more
of
living
persons
into
their
tales
without
confusion
after
considerable
deliberation
this
unassuming
person
selected
the
following
characters
judging
them
to
be
the
most
useful
and
the
most
readily
applicable
to
all
phases
and
situations
of
life
a
bad
person
wearing
a
long
dark
pigtail
and
smoking
an
opium
pipe
his
arms
to
be
folded
and
his
clothes
new
and
very
expensive
a
woman
of
low
class
one
who
removes
dust
and
useless
things
from
the
rooms
of
the
and
of
those
who
have
long
nails
she
to
be
carrying
her
a
person
from
endowed
with
qualities
which
cause
the
beholder
to
be
amused
this
character
to
be
especially
designed
to
go
with
the
short
sayings
which
remove
gravity
one
who
having
incurred
the
displeasure
of
the
sublime
emperor
has
been
decapitated
in
consequence
an
ordinary
person
of
no
striking
or
distinguished
appearance
one
who
can
be
safely
introduced
in
all
places
and
circumstances
without
great
fear
of
detection
after
many
months
spent
in
constant
practice
and
in
taking
measurements
this
unenviable
person
attained
a
very
high
degree
of
proficiency
and
could
draw
any
of
the
five
characters
without
hesitation
with
renewed
hope
therefore
he
again
approached
those
who
sit
in
and
concealing
his
identity
for
they
are
stiff
at
bending
and
when
once
a
is
classed
as
no
he
remains
so
to
the
end
in
spite
of
change
he
succeeded
in
getting
entrusted
with
a
story
by
the
elegant
and
refined
kyen
tal
this
writer
as
he
remembered
with
distrust
confines
his
distinguished
efforts
entirely
to
the
doings
of
sailors
and
of
those
connected
with
the
sea
and
this
tale
indeed
he
found
upon
reading
to
be
the
narrative
of
how
a
junk
and
its
crew
consisting
mostly
of
aged
persons
were
beguiled
out
of
their
course
by
an
exceedingly
dragon
and
wrecked
upon
an
island
of
naked
barbarians
it
was
therefore
with
a
somewhat
heavy
stomach
that
this
person
set
himself
the
task
of
arranging
his
five
characters
as
so
to
illustrate
the
words
of
the
story
the
sayings
of
the
ancient
philosopher
tai
loo
are
indeed
very
subtle
and
the
truth
of
his
remark
being
disturbed
in
dignity
by
a
foot
it
is
no
unusual
occurrence
to
fall
flat
on
the
face
in
crossing
a
muddy
street
was
now
apparent
great
as
was
the
disadvantage
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
five
characters
this
became
as
nothing
when
it
presently
appeared
that
the
avaricious
and
tieng
lin
taking
advantage
of
the
blindness
of
this
enthusiasm
had
taught
him
the
figures
so
that
they
all
gazed
in
the
same
direction
in
consequence
of
this
it
would
have
been
impossible
that
two
should
be
placed
as
in
the
act
of
conversing
together
had
not
the
noble
kyen
tal
been
inspired
to
write
that
companions
turned
from
him
in
this
incident
the
ingenious
person
who
is
recording
these
facts
made
the
subject
of
three
separate
drawings
and
having
in
one
or
two
other
places
effected
skilful
changes
in
the
writing
so
similar
in
style
to
the
strokes
of
the
illustrious
kyen
tal
as
to
be
undetectable
he
found
little
difficulty
in
making
use
of
all
his
characters
the
risks
of
the
future
however
were
too
great
to
be
run
with
impunity
therefore
it
was
arranged
by
means
of
money
for
this
person
was
fast
becoming
acquainted
with
the
ways
of
peking
that
an
emissary
from
one
who
sat
in
an
should
call
upon
him
for
a
conference
the
narrative
of
which
appeared
in
this
form
in
the
printed
leaves
of
truth
the
brilliant
and
amiable
young
kin
yen
in
spite
of
the
immediate
and
universal
success
of
his
accomplished
efforts
is
still
quite
rotund
in
intellect
nor
is
he
if
we
may
use
a
form
of
speaking
affected
by
our
friends
across
the
hoang
hai
from
swollen
a
person
with
no
recognized
position
but
one
who
occasionally
does
inferior
work
of
this
nature
for
us
recently
surprised
kin
yen
without
warning
and
found
him
in
his
sumptuously
appointed
busy
with
compasses
and
about
the
place
were
scattered
in
elegant
confusion
several
of
his
recent
masterpieces
from
the
subsequent
conversation
we
are
in
a
position
to
make
it
known
that
in
future
this
refined
and
versatile
person
will
confine
himself
entirely
to
illustrations
of
processions
funerals
armies
on
the
march
persons
pursued
by
others
and
kindred
subjects
which
appeal
strongly
to
his
imagination
kin
yen
has
severe
emotions
on
the
subject
of
individuality
in
art
and
does
not
hesitate
to
express
himself
forcibly
with
reference
to
those
who
are
content
to
degrade
the
names
of
their
ancestors
by
turning
out
what
he
wittily
describes
as
much
of
varied
the
prominence
obtained
by
this
notice
for
it
was
copied
by
others
who
were
unaware
of
the
circumstance
of
its
origin
had
the
desired
effect
in
future
when
one
of
those
who
sit
in
wished
for
a
picture
after
the
kind
mentioned
he
would
say
to
his
lesser
one
send
to
the
graceful
and
versatile
kin
yen
he
becomes
inspired
on
the
subject
of
funerals
or
persons
escaping
from
prison
or
families
walking
to
the
temple
or
whatever
it
might
be
in
that
way
this
and
illiterate
person
was
soon
both
looked
at
and
rich
so
that
it
was
his
daily
practice
to
be
carried
in
silk
garments
past
the
houses
of
those
who
had
known
him
in
poverty
and
on
these
occasions
he
would
puff
out
his
cheeks
and
pull
his
moustaches
looking
fiercely
from
side
to
side
true
are
the
words
written
in
the
elegant
and
distinguished
book
of
verses
lest
when
being
kissed
by
the
emperor
you
step
upon
the
elusive
it
was
at
the
height
of
eminence
in
this
altogether
degraded
career
that
he
encountered
the
being
who
led
him
on
to
his
present
altogether
too
lamentable
condition
tien
nung
is
the
earthly
name
by
which
is
known
she
who
combines
all
the
most
illustrious
attributes
which
have
been
possessed
of
women
since
the
days
of
the
divine
her
father
is
a
person
of
very
gross
habits
and
lives
by
selling
inferior
merchandise
covered
with
some
of
good
quality
upon
past
occasions
when
under
the
direct
influence
of
tien
and
in
the
hope
of
gaining
some
money
benefit
this
person
may
have
spoken
of
him
in
terms
of
praise
and
may
even
have
recommended
friends
to
entrust
articles
of
value
to
him
or
to
procure
goods
on
his
advice
now
however
he
records
it
as
his
unalterable
decision
that
the
father
of
tien
nung
is
by
profession
a
person
who
obtains
goods
by
stratagem
and
that
moreover
it
is
impossible
to
gain
an
advantage
over
him
on
matters
of
exchange
the
events
that
have
happened
prove
the
deep
wisdom
of
li
pen
when
he
exclaimed
whitest
of
pigeons
no
matter
how
excellent
in
the
chamber
is
not
to
be
followed
on
the
field
of
tien
herself
was
all
that
the
most
exacting
of
persons
could
demand
but
her
opinions
on
the
subject
of
were
not
formed
by
heavy
thought
and
it
would
have
been
well
if
this
had
been
borne
in
mind
by
this
person
one
morning
he
chanced
to
meet
her
while
carrying
open
in
his
hands
four
sets
of
printed
leaves
containing
his
pictures
have
observed
said
tien
after
the
usual
personal
inquiries
had
been
exchanged
the
renowned
kin
yen
who
is
the
object
of
the
keenest
envy
among
his
brother
so
little
regards
the
sacredness
of
his
accomplished
art
that
never
by
any
chance
does
he
depict
persons
of
the
very
highest
excellence
let
not
the
words
of
an
impetuous
maiden
disarrange
his
digestive
organs
if
they
should
seem
too
bold
to
the
kin
yen
but
this
matter
has
since
she
has
known
him
troubled
the
eyelids
of
tien
here
she
continued
taking
from
this
hand
one
of
the
printed
leaves
which
he
was
carrying
this
illustration
of
persons
returning
from
extinguishing
a
fire
is
there
one
who
appears
to
possess
those
qualities
which
appeal
to
all
that
is
intellectual
and
competitive
within
one
can
it
be
that
the
immaculate
kin
yen
is
unacquainted
with
the
subtle
distinction
between
the
really
select
and
the
vastly
ordinary
ah
undiscriminating
kin
yen
are
not
the
eyelashes
of
the
person
who
is
addressing
you
as
threads
of
fine
gold
to
cables
when
compared
with
those
of
the
extremely
commonplace
female
who
is
here
pictured
in
the
art
of
carrying
a
bucket
can
the
most
refined
lack
of
vanity
hide
from
you
the
fact
that
your
own
person
is
infinitely
rounder
than
this
of
the
individual
with
the
opium
pipe
o
blind
kin
yen
here
she
fled
in
honourable
confusion
leaving
this
person
standing
in
the
street
astounded
and
a
prey
to
the
most
distinguished
emotions
of
a
complicated
nature
tien
he
cried
at
length
by
those
bright
eyes
narrower
than
the
most
select
of
the
three
thousand
and
one
possessed
by
the
sublime
buddha
the
almost
fallen
kin
yen
will
yet
prove
himself
worthy
of
your
esteemed
consideration
he
will
without
delay
learn
to
draw
two
new
living
persons
and
will
incorporate
in
them
the
likenesses
which
you
have
returning
swiftly
to
his
abode
he
therefore
inscribed
and
despatched
this
letter
in
proof
of
his
resolve
the
human
chrysanthemum
in
whose
body
reside
the
celestial
principles
and
the
imprisoned
colours
of
the
rainbow
the
very
offensive
and
this
person
will
take
no
rest
nor
eat
any
but
the
commonest
food
until
he
shall
have
carried
out
the
wishes
of
his
one
jade
star
she
whose
teeth
he
is
not
worthy
to
blacken
kin
yen
has
been
entrusted
with
a
story
which
contains
a
being
in
some
degree
reflecting
the
character
of
tien
he
will
embellish
it
with
her
irreproachable
profile
and
come
to
hear
her
words
till
then
he
bids
her
from
that
moment
most
of
this
time
was
necessarily
spent
in
learning
to
draw
the
two
new
characters
and
in
consequence
of
this
he
lost
much
work
and
indeed
the
greater
part
of
the
connexion
which
he
had
been
at
such
pains
to
form
gradually
slipped
away
from
him
many
months
passed
before
he
was
competent
to
reproduce
persons
resembling
tien
and
himself
for
in
this
he
was
unassisted
by
tieng
lin
and
his
progress
was
slow
at
length
being
satisfied
he
called
upon
the
least
fierce
of
those
who
sit
in
and
requested
that
he
might
be
entrusted
with
a
story
for
should
have
been
covered
with
honourable
joy
to
set
in
operation
the
brush
of
the
inspired
kin
yen
replied
the
other
with
agreeable
condescension
at
the
moment
it
does
not
chance
that
we
have
before
us
any
stories
in
which
funerals
or
beggars
being
driven
from
the
city
form
the
chief
incidents
perhaps
if
the
polished
kin
yen
should
happen
to
be
passing
this
office
in
about
six
time
brush
of
kin
yen
will
never
again
depict
funerals
or
labourers
arranging
themselves
to
receive
pay
or
similar
subjects
exclaimed
this
person
impetuously
as
it
is
well
said
lightning
discovers
objects
which
the
fails
to
in
future
none
but
tales
dealing
with
the
most
distinguished
persons
shall
have
his
this
be
the
true
word
of
the
dignified
kin
yen
it
is
possible
that
we
may
be
able
to
animate
his
inspired
faculties
was
the
response
in
that
case
as
a
new
style
must
be
in
the
nature
of
an
experiment
and
as
our
public
has
come
to
regard
kin
yen
as
the
great
exponent
of
art
facing
in
one
direction
we
can
not
continue
the
exceedingly
liberal
payment
with
which
we
have
been
accustomed
to
reward
his
elegant
the
story
be
suitable
that
is
a
matter
of
less
importance
replied
this
person
story
said
the
one
in
the
by
the
refined
and
it
treats
of
the
and
conscientious
doubts
of
one
who
would
become
a
priest
of
fo
when
preparing
for
this
distinguished
office
he
discovers
within
himself
leanings
towards
the
religion
of
his
illustrious
scruples
are
enhanced
by
his
affection
for
wu
ping
who
now
appears
in
the
the
ending
inquired
this
person
for
it
was
desirable
that
the
two
should
marry
happily
inimitable
stories
of
never
have
any
real
ending
and
this
one
being
in
his
most
elevated
style
has
even
less
end
than
most
of
them
but
the
whole
narrative
is
permeated
with
the
odour
of
and
honourable
and
the
two
characters
are
both
of
noble
as
it
might
be
some
time
before
another
story
so
suitable
should
be
offered
or
one
which
would
afford
so
good
an
opportunity
of
wafting
incense
to
tien
and
of
displaying
her
incomparable
outline
in
dignified
and
magnanimous
attitudes
this
was
eagerly
accepted
and
for
the
next
week
this
obscure
person
spent
all
his
days
and
nights
in
picturing
the
lovely
tien
and
his
debased
self
in
the
characters
of
the
young
priest
of
fo
and
wu
ping
the
pictures
finished
he
caused
them
to
be
carefully
conveyed
to
the
office
and
then
sitting
down
spent
many
hours
in
composing
the
following
letter
to
be
sent
to
tien
accompanying
a
copy
of
the
printed
leaves
wherein
the
story
and
his
drawing
should
appear
the
light
has
for
a
period
been
hidden
from
a
person
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
for
him
to
be
struck
blind
on
gazing
at
the
sun
therefore
if
the
sublime
tien
values
the
eyes
of
kin
yen
let
her
hide
herself
behind
a
gauze
screen
on
his
approach
trembling
words
of
tien
have
sunk
deep
into
the
inside
of
kin
yen
and
become
part
of
his
being
never
again
can
he
depict
persons
of
the
quality
and
in
the
position
he
was
wont
to
do
this
he
sends
his
latest
efforts
in
each
case
he
conceives
his
drawings
to
be
the
pictures
of
the
written
words
in
the
noble
case
it
is
undoubtedly
so
in
his
own
he
aspires
to
it
doubtless
the
unobtrusive
tien
would
make
no
claim
to
the
character
and
manner
of
behaving
of
the
one
in
the
story
yet
kin
yen
confidently
asserts
that
she
is
to
the
other
as
the
glove
is
to
the
hand
and
he
is
filled
with
the
most
intelligent
delight
at
being
able
to
exhibit
her
in
her
true
robes
by
which
she
will
be
known
to
all
who
see
her
in
spite
of
her
dignified
protests
kin
yen
hopes
he
will
come
this
evening
after
the
week
which
passed
between
the
finishing
of
the
pictures
and
the
appearance
of
the
eminent
printed
leaves
containing
them
was
the
longest
in
this
life
but
at
length
the
day
arrived
and
going
with
exceedingly
mean
haste
to
the
place
of
sale
he
purchased
a
copy
and
sent
it
together
with
the
letter
of
his
honourable
intention
on
which
he
had
bestowed
so
much
care
to
tien
not
till
then
did
it
occur
to
this
inconsiderable
one
that
the
impetuousness
of
his
action
was
for
might
it
not
be
that
the
pictures
were
or
that
the
delicate
and
fragrant
words
painting
the
character
of
the
one
who
now
bore
the
features
of
tien
had
undergone
some
change
to
satisfy
himself
scarce
as
taels

sayings
of
the
wise
and
venerable

constructed
so
as
to
be
of
service
and
consolation
in
moments
of
strong
mental
distress
these
for
the
greater
part
recommend
tranquillity
of
mind
a
complete
abnegation
of
the
human
passions
and
the
like
behaviour
the
person
who
is
here
endeavouring
to
bring
this
account
of
his
dishonourable
career
to
a
close
pondered
these
for
some
moments
after
twice
glancing
through
the
matter
in
the
printed
leaves
and
then
finding
the
faculties
of
speech
and
movement
restored
to
him
procured
a
knife
of
distinguished
brilliance
and
went
forth
to
call
upon
the
one
who
sits
in
an
said
the
lesser
one
insidiously
stepping
in
between
this
person

door

and
chief

not
here
may
his
entirely
insufficient
substitute
offer
words
of
congratulation
to
the
inspired
kin
yen
on
his
effective
and
striking
pictures
in
this
issue
altogether
insufficient
substitute
answered
this
person
with
difficulty
mastering
his
great
rage
and
shall
offer
words
of
explanation
to
the
inspired
kin
yen
setting
forth
the
reason
of
his
pictures
being
used
not
with
the
story
of
the
elegant
for
which
they
were
executed
but
accompanying
exceedingly
base
foolish
and
ungrammatical
words
written
by
the
peking
remover
of
gravity
words
which
will
evermore
brand
the
tien
as
a
person
of
light
speech
and
no
and
in
his
agony
this
person
struck
the
lacquered
table
several
times
with
his
elegant
knife
kin
yen
exclaimed
the
lesser
one
matter
rests
not
here
it
is
a
thing
beyond
the
sphere
of
the
individual
who
is
addressing
you
all
he
can
tell
is
that
the
graceful
withdrew
his
exceedingly
tedious
story
for
some
reason
at
the
final
moment
and
as
your
eminent
drawings
had
been
paid
for
my
chief
of
the
inner
office
decided
to
use
them
with
this
story
of
but
surely
it
can
not
be
that
there
is
aught
in
the
story
to
displease
your
illustrious
personality
for
yourself
this
person
said
understanding
that
the
two
immaculate
characters
figuring
as
the
personages
of
the
narrative
are
exact
copies
of
this
dishonoured
person
himself
and
of
the
willowy
tien
daughter
of
the
vastly
rich
whom
he
was
hopeful
of
selecting
one
of
the
least
offensive
of
the
passages
in
the
work
this
unhappy
person
read
the
following
immature
and
inelegant
words
writer
of
printed
leaves
had
a
time
last
night
after
chow
had
departed
to
see
about
food
and
the
junk
had
been
fastened
up
at
the
lock
of
kilung
on
the
he
and
the
shang
were
journeying
along
the
narrow
path
by
the
when
the
right
leg
of
the
graceful
and
popular
person
who
is
narrating
these
events
disappeared
into
the
river
suffering
no
apprehension
in
the
dark
but
that
the
vanishing
limb
was
the
left
leg
of
shang
this
intelligent
writer
allowed
his
impassiveness
to
melt
away
to
an
exaggerated
degree
but
at
that
moment
the
circumstance
became
plain
to
the
shang
who
was
in
consequence
very
grossly
amused
at
the
mishap
and
misapprehension
of
your
good
lord
the
writer
at
the
same
time
pointing
out
the
matter
as
it
really
was
then
it
chanced
that
there
came
by
one
of
the
maidens
who
carry
tea
and
jest
for
small
sums
of
money
to
the
sitters
at
the
little
tables
with
round
white
tops
at
which
this
remarkable
person
the
confidant
of
many
mandarins
ever
desirous
of
displaying
his
priceless
power
of
removing
gravity
said
to
her
much
of
gladness
by
the
sacred
serpent
this
is
plainly
your
night
the
true
facts
of
the
predicament
of
this
commendable
writer
she
replied
not
your
illustrious
pigtail
to
be
removed
venerable
wang
for
in
this
estimation
it
is
indeed
your
night
are
times
when
this
valued
person
wonders
whether
his
method
of
removing
gravity
be
in
reality
very
antique
or
quite
new
on
such
occasions
the
world
with
all
its
schools
and
those
who
interfere
in
the
concerns
of
others
continues
to
revolve
around
him
the
wondrous
come
out
silently
two
by
two
like
to
the
crystallized
music
of
stringed
woods
then
in
the
mystery
of
his
head
becomes
greatly
enlarged
with
celestial
and
thoughts
his
groping
hand
seems
to
touch
matter
which
may
be
written
out
in
his
impressive
style
and
sold
to
those
who
print
leaves
and
he
goes
home
to
write
out
when
this
person
looked
up
after
reading
with
tears
of
shame
in
his
eyes
he
perceived
that
the
lesser
one
had
cautiously
disappeared
therefore
being
unable
to
gain
admittance
to
the
inner
office
he
returned
to
his
home
here
the
remark
of
the
omniscient
tai
loo
again
fixes
itself
upon
the
attention
no
sooner
had
this
incapable
person
reached
his
house
than
he
became
aware
that
a
parcel
had
arrived
for
him
from
the
still
adorable
tien
retiring
to
a
distance
from
it
he
opened
the
accompanying
letter
and
read
a
virtuous
maiden
has
been
made
the
victim
of
a
heartless
jest
or
a
piece
of
coarse
stupidity
at
a
hands
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
for
him
to
be
struck
blind
on
meeting
her
father
therefore
if
the
degraded
and
kin
yen
values
his
eyes
ears
nose
pigtail
even
his
dishonourable
breath
let
him
hide
himself
behind
a
fortified
wall
at
approach
this
tien
returns
everything
she
has
ever
accepted
from
kin
yen
she
even
includes
the
brace
of
puppies
which
she
received
anonymously
about
a
month
ago
and
which
she
did
not
eat
but
kept
for
reasons
of
her
own
reasons
entirely
unconnected
with
the
vapid
and
exceedingly
conceited
kin
as
though
this
letter
and
the
puppies
of
which
this
person
now
heard
for
the
first
time
making
him
aware
of
the
existence
of
a
rival
lover
were
not
enough
there
almost
immediately
arrived
a
letter
from
father
person
has
taken
the
advice
of
those
skilled
in
extorting
money
by
means
of
law
forms
and
he
finds
that
kin
yen
has
been
guilty
of
a
grave
and
highly
expensive
act
this
is
increased
by
the
fact
that
tien
had
conveyed
his
seemingly
distinguished
intentions
to
all
her
friends
before
whom
she
now
stands
in
an
exceedingly
ungraceful
attitude
the
machinery
for
depriving
kin
yen
of
all
the
necessaries
of
existence
shall
be
put
into
operation
at
at
this
point
the
person
who
is
now
concluding
his
obscure
and
commonplace
history
having
spent
his
last
piece
of
money
on
and
and
being
convinced
of
the
presence
of
the
spirits
of
his
ancestors
is
inspired
to
make
the
following
prophecies
that
tieng
lin
who
imposed
upon
him
in
the
matter
of
shall
come
to
a
sudden
end
accompanied
by
great
internal
pains
after
suffering
extreme
poverty
that
the
one
who
sits
in
an
together
with
his
lesser
one
and
all
who
make
stories
for
them
shall
while
sailing
to
a
rice
feast
during
the
festival
of
flowers
be
precipitated
into
the
water
and
slowly
devoured
by
sea
monsters
in
particular
being
tortured
in
the
process
that
the
father
of
tien
shall
be
seized
with
the
dancing
sickness
when
in
the
presence
of
the
august
emperor
and
being
in
consequence
suspected
of
treachery
shall
to
prove
the
truth
of
his
denials
be
submitted
to
the
tests
of
boiling
tar
swords
and
of
being
dropped
from
a
great
height
on
to
the
sacred
stone
of
goodness
and
badness
in
each
of
which
he
shall
fail
to
convince
his
judges
or
to
establish
his
innocence
to
the
amusement
of
all
beholders
these
are
the
true
words
of
kin
yen
the
who
having
unweighed
his
mind
and
exposed
the
avaricious
villainy
of
certain
persons
is
now
retiring
by
night
to
a
very
select
and
hidden
spot
in
the
khingan
mountains
