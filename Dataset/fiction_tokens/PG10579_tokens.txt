your
attention

a
few
moments
i
will
be
happy
to
introduce
to
your
favorable
notice
an
entertainer
of
fame
who
will
i
am
sure
not
only
mystify
you
but
at
the
same
time
interest
you
you
have
witnessed
the
dives
of
the
demon
discobolus
you
have
laughed
with
the
comical
clowns
you
have
thrilled
with
the
hurrying
horses
and
you
have
gasped
at
the
ponderous
pachyderms

you
are
to
be
shown

trick
which
has
baffled
the
most
profound
minds
of
this

any

i
may
say
of
the
world
jim
tracy
ringmaster
and
in
this
instance
stage
manager
of
sampson
brothers
circus
paused
in
his
announcement
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
indicated
a
youth
attired
in
a
spotless
suit
of
white
silk
the
youth
who
stood
in
the
center
of
a
stage
erected
in
the
big
tent
bowed
as
the
manager
waited
to
allow
time
for
the
applause
to
die
away
you
have
all
seen
ordinary
magicians
at
work
making
eggs
disappear
up
their
sleeves
went
on
the
stage
manager
you
have
i
doubt
not
witnessed
some
of
them
producing
live
rabbits
from
silk
hats
but
professor
joe
strong
who
will
shortly
have
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
you
not
only
makes
eggs
disappear
but
what
is
far
more
difficult
he
causes
a
lady
to
vanish
into
thin
air
you
will
see
a
beautiful
lady
seated
in
full
view
of
you
a
moment
later
by
the
practice
of
his
magical
art
professor
strong
will
cause
the
same
lady
to
disappear
utterly
and
he
will
defy
any
of
you
to
tell
how
it
is
done
now
professor
if
you
are
ready
and
with
a
nod
and
a
wave
of
his
hand
toward
the
youth
in
the
white
silk
tights
jim
tracy
stepped
off
the
elevated
stage
and
hurried
to
the
other
end
of
the
circus
tent
where
he
had
to
see
to
it
that
another
feature
of
the
entertainment
was
in
readiness
oh
joe
i
actually
nervous
do
you
think
i
can
do
it
all
right
asked
a
pretty
girl
attired
in
a
dress
of
black
silk
which
was
in
striking
contrast
to
joe
strong
white
sheeny
costume
do
it
helen
of
course
you
can
exclaimed
the
magician
as
he
had
been
termed
by
the
ringmaster
do
just
as
you
did
in
the
rehearsals
and
you
be
all
right
but
suppose
something
should
go
wrong
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
do
be
in
the
least
excited
i
get
you
out
of
any
predicament
you
may
get
into
tricks
do
sometimes
go
wrong
but
i
used
to
that
cover
it
up
somehow
however
i
do
anticipate
anything
going
wrong
now
take
your
place
while
i
give
them
a
little
patter
this
talk
had
taken
place
in
low
voices
and
with
a
rapidity
which
did
not
keep
the
expectant
audience
waiting
joe
strong
while
he
was
reassuring
helen
morton
his
partner
in
the
trick
and
also
the
girl
to
whom
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
was
rapidly
getting
the
stage
ready
for
the
illusion
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
joe
as
he
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
stage
i
am
afraid
our
genial
manager
has
rather
overstated
my
powers
what
i
am
about
to
do
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
is
a
trick
i
lay
no
claim
to
supernatural
powers
but
if
i
can
do
a
trick
and
you
tell
how
it
is
done
then
you
must
admit
that
for
the
moment
i
am
smarter
than
you
in
other
words
i
am
going
to
deceive
you
but
the
point
is
how
do
i
do
it
with
this
introduction
i
will
now
state
what
i
am
about
to
do
mademoiselle
mortonti
will
seat
herself
on
a
stage
in
a
chair
in
full
view
of
you
all
i
will
cover
her
for
a
moment
only
with
a
silken
veil
this
if
i
were
a
real
necromancer
i
should
say
was
to
prevent
your
seeing
her
dissolve
into
a
spirit
as
she
disappears
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
is
to
conceal
the
manner
in
which
i
do
the
trick
you
guess
that
anyhow
if
i
did
tell
you
he
added
there
was
a
laugh
at
this
admission
as
soon
as
i
remove
the
silken
veil
went
on
joe
you
will
see
that
the
lady
will
have
disappeared
before
your
very
eyes
what
that
through
a
hole
in
the
stage
did
some
one
say
questioned
joe
appearing
to
catch
a
protesting
voice
well
that
what
i
hear
everywhere
i
go
he
went
on
with
easy
calmness
every
time
i
do
the
vanishing
lady
trick
some
one
thinks
she
disappears
through
a
hole
in
the
stage
now
in
order
to
convince
you
to
the
contrary
i
am
going
to
put
a
newspaper
over
that
part
of
the
stage
where
the
chair
is
placed
i
will
show
you
the
paper
before
and
after
the
trick
and
if
there
is
not
a
hole
or
a
tear
in
the
paper
either
before
or
after
the
lady
has
disappeared
i
think
you
will
admit
that
the
lady
did
not
go
through
a
hole
in
the
stage
floor
wo
you
asked
joe
strong
yes
i
thought
you
would
he
added
as
he
pretended
to
hear
a
yes
from
somewhere
in
the
audience
all
ready
now
helen
he
said
in
a
low
voice
to
the
girl
and
an
attendant
brought
forward
an
ordinary
looking
chair
and
a
newspaper
joe
who
had
done
the
trick
many
times
before
but
not
often
with
helen
was
perfectly
at
ease
helen
was
very
frankly
nervous
she
had
not
done
the
trick
for
some
time
and
joe
had
introduced
into
it
some
novel
features
since
last
presenting
it
helen
was
afraid
she
would
cause
some
hitch
in
the
performance
you
be
all
right
joe
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
just
act
as
though
you
had
done
this
every
day
for
a
year
placing
the
chair
in
the
center
of
the
stage
and
handing
joe
the
newspaper
the
attendant
stepped
back
joe
addressed
the
audience
you
here
see
the
paper
said
the
magician
as
he
held
it
up
you
see
that
there
is
no
hole
in
it
i
now
spread
it
down
on
the
stage
if
the
lady
disappears
down
through
the
stage
she
will
have
to
tear
the
paper
you
shall
see
if
she
does
joe
next
placed
the
chair
directly
over
the
square
of
paper
and
motioned
to
helen
her
plain
black
dress
of
soft
clinging
silk
swayed
about
her
as
she
took
her
place
i
might
add
said
joe
pausing
a
moment
after
helen
had
taken
her
seat
that
in
order
to
prevent
any
shock
to
mademoiselle
mortonti
i
am
going
to
mesmerize
her
she
will
then
be
unconscious
i
do
this
for
two
reasons
in
totally
disappearing
there
is
sometimes
a
shock
to
a
person
mentality
that
is
unpleasant
to
avoid
indicting
that
on
mademoiselle
mortonti
i
will
hypnotize
her
the
other
reason
i
do
that
is
that
she
may
not
know
how
or
when
she
disappears
thus
she
will
not
be
able
to
see
how
i
do
the
trick
and
so
can
not
give
away
my
secret
of
course
this
was
all
bunk
or
patter
to
use
names
given
to
it
by
the
performers
it
kept
the
attention
of
the
audience
and
so
enabled
joe
to
do
certain
things
without
attracting
too
much
attention
to
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
not
mesmerize
helen
and
she
knew
perfectly
well
how
the
trick
was
done
those
who
have
read
previous
books
of
this
series
are
also
in
the
secret
joe
waved
his
hands
in
front
of
helen
face
she
swayed
slightly
in
her
chair
then
her
eyes
closed
as
though
against
her
will
and
she
seemed
to
sleep
she
is
now
in
the
proper
condition
for
the
trick
said
joe
i
must
beg
of
you
not
to
make
any
sudden
or
unnecessary
noise
you
might
suddenly
awaken
her
from
the
mesmeric
slumber
and
this
might
be
very
serious
as
joe
said
this
with
every
indication
of
meaning
it
there
was
a
quick
hush
among
the
audience
even
though
many
knew
it
was
only
a
trick
they
could
not
help
being
impressed
by
the
solemn
note
in
joe
voice
such
is
the
psychology
of
an
audience
and
the
power
over
it
of
a
single
person
she
now
sleeps
said
joe
in
a
low
voice
as
a
matter
of
fact
helen
was
wide
awake
and
as
joe
stood
between
her
and
the
circus
crowd
she
slowly
opened
one
eye
and
winked
at
him
he
was
glad
to
see
this
as
it
showed
her
nervousness
had
left
her
now
for
the
mystic
veil
cried
joe
as
he
took
from
his
helper
a
thin
clinging
piece
of
black
silk
gauze
he
tossed
this
over
helen
and
the
chair
completely
covering
both
from
sight
he
brought
the
veil
around
behind
helen
head
fastening
it
there
with
a
pin
to
make
sure
that
mademoiselle
mortonti
sleeps
i
will
now
make
the
few
remaining
mesmeric
passes
said
joe
i
must
be
positive
that
she
slumbers
he
waved
his
hands
slowly
over
the
black
robed
figure
a
great
hush
had
fallen
over
the
big
crowd
every
eye
was
on
the
black
figure
in
the
center
of
the
raised
stage
in
the
middle
of
the
big
circus
tent
all
the
other
acts
had
temporarily
stopped
to
make
that
of
joe
strong
the
boy
magician
more
spectacular
as
joe
continued
to
wave
one
hand
with
an
undulating
motion
over
the
silent
figure
in
the
chair
he
touched
here
and
there
the
drapery
over
helen
he
seemed
very
solicitous
that
it
should
hang
perfectly
right
covering
the
figure
of
the
girl
and
the
chair
completely
from
sight
in
every
direction
all
around
the
stage
the
music
which
had
been
playing
softly
suddenly
stopped
at
a
wave
of
joe
hand
he
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
before
the
veiled
figure
her
spirit
is
dissolving
into
thin
air
he
said
in
a
low
voice
which
nevertheless
carried
to
every
one
in
the
crowd
suddenly
joe
took
hold
of
the
veil
in
the
center
and
directly
over
the
outlined
head
of
the
figure
in
the
chair
quickly
the
young
magician
raised
the
soft
black
silk
gauze
whisking
it
quickly
to
one
side
the
audience
gasped
the
chair
in
which
but
a
moment
before
helen
morton
had
been
seated
was
empty
the
girl
had
disappeared
vanished
joe
stooped
and
raised
from
the
stage
the
newspaper
it
showed
not
a
sign
of
break
or
tear
then
before
the
applause
could
begin
the
girl
appeared
walking
out
from
one
of
the
improvised
wings
of
the
circus
stage
she
smiled
and
bowed
the
act
had
been
a
great
success
now
the
silent
admiration
of
the
throng
gave
place
to
a
wave
of
hand
clapping
and
feet
stamping
was
it
all
right
joe
asked
helen
as
he
held
her
hand
and
they
both
bowed
their
appreciation
of
the
applause
could
have
been
better
he
said
we
do
this
trick
regularly
now
it
takes
even
better
than
my
ten
thousand
dollar
box
mystery
you
were
great
i
so
glad
the
two
performers
were
bowing
themselves
off
the
stage
when
suddenly
there
came
the
unmistakable
roar
of
a
wild
beast
from
the
direction
of
the
animal
tent
it
seemed
to
shake
the
very
ground
at
the
same
time
a
voice
cried
a
tiger
is
loose
one
of
the
tigers
is
out
of
his
cage
chapter
ii
a
dangerous
swing
there
is
no
cry
which
so
startles
the
average
circus
audience
as
that
which
is
raised
when
one
of
the
wild
animals
is
said
to
be
at
large
not
even
the
alarm
that
the
big
tent
is
falling
or
is
about
to
be
blown
over
will
cause
such
a
panic
as
the
shout
a
tiger
is
loose
there
is
something
instinctive
and
perfectly
natural
in
the
fear
of
the
wild
jungle
beasts
let
it
be
said
that
a
tiger
or
a
lion
is
loose
and
it
causes
greater
fear
even
than
when
it
is
stated
that
an
elephant
is
on
a
rampage
an
elephant
seems
a
big
but
creature
though
often
they
turn
ugly
but
a
lion
or
a
tiger
is
always
feared
when
loose
but
the
chances
are
not
one
in
a
hundred
that
a
circus
lion
or
a
tiger
getting
out
of
its
cage
would
attack
any
one
the
creature
is
so
surprised
at
getting
loose
and
so
frightened
at
the
hue
and
cry
at
once
raised
that
all
it
wants
to
do
is
to
slink
off
and
hide
and
the
only
harm
it
might
do
would
be
to
some
one
who
tried
to
stop
it
from
running
away
joe
strong
jim
tracy
and
the
other
circus
executives
and
employees
knew
this
as
soon
as
they
heard
the
cry
a
tiger
is
loose
who
raised
the
cry
and
which
of
the
several
tigers
in
the
sampson
show
was
out
of
its
cage
neither
joe
nor
any
of
those
in
the
big
tent
near
him
knew
but
they
realized
the
emergency
and
knew
what
to
do
keep
your
seats
do
rush
cried
joe
as
he
released
helen
hand
and
hurried
to
the
front
of
the
platform
there
is
no
danger
the
animal
men
will
catch
the
tiger
if
one
is
really
loose
stay
where
you
are
keep
your
seats
do
rush
it
is
the
panic
and
rush
that
circus
men
are
afraid
of
the
pushing
and
milling
of
the
crowd
and
the
trampling
under
foot
of
helpless
women
and
children
there
was
some
commotion
near
the
junction
of
the
animal
tent
and
that
in
which
the
main
performance
took
place
what
it
was
joe
did
not
concern
himself
about
just
then
he
felt
it
to
be
his
task
to
prevent
a
panic
and
to
this
he
lent
himself
aided
by
helen
jim
tracy
and
others
who
realized
the
danger
and
while
this
is
going
on
and
while
the
expert
animal
men
are
preparing
to
get
back
into
its
cage
the
tiger
which
it
was
learned
afterward
had
got
out
through
an
imperfectly
fastened
door
time
will
be
taken
to
tell
new
readers
something
about
joe
strong
and
the
series
of
books
in
which
he
is
the
central
character
joe
strong
seemed
destined
for
a
circus
life
and
for
entertaining
audiences
with
and
other
mystery
matters
his
father
alexander
strong
known
professionally
as
professor
morretti
was
a
stage
magician
of
talents
and
joe
mother
who
was
born
in
england
had
been
a
rider
of
trick
horses
his
parents
died
when
joe
was
young
he
did
not
have
a
very
happy
boyhood
and
one
day
he
ran
away
from
the
man
with
whom
he
was
living
and
joined
a
traveling
magician
who
called
himself
professor
rosello
with
him
joe
who
had
a
natural
aptitude
for
the
business
learned
to
become
a
performer
in
the
first
book
of
the
series
entitled
joe
strong
the
boy
wizard
or
the
mysteries
of
magic
exposed
is
told
how
joe
got
on
in
life
after
his
first
start
joe
was
not
only
a
stage
magician
but
he
had
inherited
strength
skill
and
daring
and
he
liked
nothing
better
than
climbing
to
great
heights
or
walking
in
lofty
and
dizzy
places
where
the
footing
was
perilous
so
it
was
perhaps
natural
that
he
should
join
the
sampson
brothers
show
and
in
the
second
book
is
related
under
the
title
joe
strong
on
the
trapeze
or
the
daring
feats
of
a
young
circus
performer
what
happened
to
our
hero
under
canvas
joe
loved
the
circus
life
even
though
he
made
some
enemies
but
he
had
many
friends
there
was
helen
morton
then
there
was
benny
turton
who
did
a
tank
act
and
was
billed
as
a
human
fish
jim
tracy
the
ringmaster
bill
watson
the
veteran
clown
and
his
wife
the
circus
mother
tom
layton
the
elephant
man
who
taught
the
big
creatures
many
tricks
were
only
a
few
of
joe
friends
among
others
might
be
mentioned
señor
bogardi
the
lion
tamer
talfo
the
professional
fat
lady
señorita
tanzalo
the
pretty
snake
charmer
and
tom
jefferson
the
strong
man
joe
loved
them
all
the
circus
was
like
one
big
family
with
as
might
be
expected
a
black
sheep
here
and
there
joe
became
an
expert
on
the
trapeze
and
later
when
benny
turton
was
temporarily
in
a
hospital
joe
took
on
the
tank
trick
in
the
third
volume
some
of
his
feats
are
related
while
in
the
fourth
book
joe
acts
on
a
motor
cycle
on
the
high
wire
are
dealt
with
with
his
wings
of
steel
joe
caused
a
sensation
and
after
an
absence
from
the
circus
for
a
time
he
joined
it
again
bringing
this
act
to
it
eventually
joe
was
made
one
of
the
circus
owners
and
now
controlled
a
majority
of
the
stock
he
had
also
inherited
considerable
money
from
his
mother
relatives
in
england
so
that
now
the
youth
was
financially
well
off
for
one
who
had
started
so
humbly
the
book
immediately
preceding
this
one
is
called
joe
strong
and
his
box
of
mystery
or
the
ten
thousand
dollar
prize
trick
in
that
volume
is
related
how
joe
constructed
a
trick
box
out
of
which
he
made
his
way
after
it
was
locked
and
corded
about
with
ropes
helen
morton
helped
him
in
this
trick
which
was
very
successful
the
circus
management
offered
a
prize
of
ten
thousand
dollars
to
whomsoever
could
fathom
how
the
trick
was
done
bill
carfax
an
enemy
of
joe
and
a
former
circus
employee
tried
to
solve
the
problem
but
failed
the
box
trick
was
a
great
attraction
for
the
circus
and
joe
was
in
higher
favor
than
before
he
had
been
on
the
road
with
the
show
for
some
time
when
the
events
detailed
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
book
took
place
by
dint
of
much
shouting
and
urging
the
people
to
retain
their
seats
and
not
rush
into
danger
joe
strong
and
the
others
succeeded
in
calming
the
circus
crowd
meanwhile
there
was
much
suppressed
excitement
is
the
tiger
caught
is
he
back
in
his
cage
was
asked
on
every
side
while
joe
and
his
fellow
showmen
were
calming
the
crowd
the
animal
men
were
having
their
own
troubles
burma
one
of
the
largest
of
the
tigers
had
got
loose
having
taken
advantage
of
the
open
door
of
his
cage
he
rushed
out
with
a
snarl
of
delight
at
his
freedom
his
jungle
cry
was
echoed
by
the
roar
of
a
lion
in
the
next
cage
and
this
was
followed
by
the
cries
and
snarls
of
all
the
wild
jungle
beasts
in
the
tent
fortunately
the
animal
tent
was
deserted
by
all
save
the
keepers
the
audience
having
filed
into
the
tent
where
the
main
show
was
going
on
head
him
off
now
head
him
off
cried
tom
layton
the
elephant
man
as
he
saw
the
tiger
dart
out
of
its
cage
a
flash
of
yellow
and
black
head
him
off
do
let
him
get
in
the
main
top
that
right
head
him
off
cried
señor
bogardi
the
lion
tamer
he
wo
hurt
any
one
he
too
scared
this
was
true
but
it
was
difficult
to
believe
and
some
of
the
people
seated
in
the
main
top
or
big
tent
who
were
nearest
the
animal
tent
hearing
the
cries
and
learning
what
had
occurred
spread
the
alarm
burma
the
tiger
slunk
around
in
behind
the
cages
of
the
other
animals
all
about
him
were
men
with
clubs
and
pointed
goads
with
whips
and
pistols
the
circus
men
had
had
to
cope
with
situations
like
this
before
they
surrounded
the
tiger
advancing
on
him
in
an
circle
and
in
a
short
time
they
drove
him
into
an
emergency
cage
which
was
pushed
forward
with
the
open
door
toward
him
burma
had
no
choice
but
to
enter
to
get
away
from
the
cracking
whips
and
the
prodding
goads
and
after
all
he
was
glad
to
be
barred
in
again
so
without
causing
any
harm
except
for
badly
frightening
a
number
of
people
in
the
audience
the
tiger
was
caged
again
and
the
circus
performance
went
on
joe
strong
did
his
box
of
mystery
trick
the
usual
announcement
of
a
reward
of
ten
thousand
dollars
to
whomsoever
could
solve
it
was
made
and
there
was
great
applause
when
joe
managed
to
get
out
of
the
big
box
without
disturbing
the
six
padlocks
or
the
binding
ropes
i
glad
bill
carfax
is
here
to
make
trouble
trying
to
show
how
much
he
knows
about
this
trick
said
joe
to
the
ringmaster
as
he
stepped
off
the
stage
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trick
yes
you
put
several
spokes
in
bill
wheels
when
you
turned
the
laugh
on
him
that
time
said
jim
tracy
i
do
believe
he
ever
show
up
around
our
circus
again
but
they
little
knew
bill
carfax
those
who
have
read
the
book
just
before
this
will
recall
him
and
remember
how
unscrupulous
he
was
but
his
plans
came
to
naught
then
any
one
who
wishes
to
learn
how
the
wonderful
box
trick
was
worked
will
find
a
full
explanation
in
the
previous
volume
helen
morton
received
much
applause
at
the
conclusion
of
her
act
with
her
trick
horse
rosebud
joe
strong
promised
wife
was
an
accomplished
bareback
rider
as
well
as
one
of
her
fiancé
helpers
in
his
mystery
tricks
well
i
glad
is
over
said
helen
to
joe
that
night
as
they
went
to
the
train
that
was
to
take
them
to
the
next
city
where
the
circus
performance
would
be
given
what
with
doing
the
vanishing
lady
act
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
while
and
the
tiger
getting
loose
we
have
had
quite
a
bit
of
excitement
yes
agreed
joe
but
everything
came
out
all
right
i
going
to
put
on
a
new
stunt
next
week
what
that
asked
helen
something
in
the
mystery
line
no
i
going
back
to
some
of
my
high
trapeze
work
you
know
since
we
lost
wogand
there
has
been
any
of
the
big
swing
work
done
that
so
agreed
helen
but
i
been
so
busy
practicing
the
vanishing
lady
act
with
you
on
top
of
my
other
work
that
i
had
given
it
a
thought
but
you
are
going
to
do
that
dangerous
trick
are
you
i
think
i
am
joe
answered
it
sensational
and
we
need
sensational
acts
now
to
draw
the
crowds
i
used
to
do
it
and
i
can
again
i
think
with
a
little
practice
i
going
to
start
in
and
train
i
wish
you
would
said
helen
in
a
low
voice
but
joe
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
the
big
swing
was
a
trapeze
act
performed
on
the
highest
of
the
circus
apparatus
part
of
this
apparatus
consisted
of
two
platforms
fastened
to
two
of
the
opposite
main
poles
and
up
under
the
very
roof
of
the
big
top
midway
between
the
platforms
which
were
just
large
enough
for
a
man
to
stand
on
was
a
trapeze
with
long
ropes
capable
of
being
swung
from
one
resting
place
to
the
other
it
was
in
reality
a
big
swing
joe
act
which
he
had
often
done
but
which
of
late
had
been
performed
by
a
man
billed
as
wogand
was
to
stand
on
one
platform
have
the
long
trapeze
started
in
a
long
pendulumlike
swing
by
an
attendant
and
then
to
leap
down
catch
hold
of
the
bar
with
his
hands
and
swing
up
to
the
other
platform
if
he
missed
catching
the
bar
it
meant
a
dangerous
fall
a
fall
into
a
net
it
is
true
but
dangerous
none
the
less
its
danger
can
be
judged
when
it
is
said
that
wogand
had
died
as
an
indirect
result
of
a
fall
into
the
net
he
missed
the
trapeze
toppled
into
the
net
and
by
some
chance
did
not
land
properly
his
back
was
injured
his
spine
became
affected
and
he
died
when
circus
performers
on
the
high
trapezes
fall
or
jump
into
the
safety
nets
they
do
not
usually
do
it
haphazardly
if
they
did
many
would
be
killed
there
is
a
certain
knack
and
trick
of
landing
in
a
net
joe
strong
ever
having
the
interest
of
the
circus
at
heart
had
decided
to
do
this
dangerous
swing
he
was
an
acrobat
as
well
as
a
stage
magician
and
he
had
decided
to
take
up
some
of
his
earlier
acts
which
had
been
so
successful
but
i
wish
he
would
said
helen
to
herself
i
have
a
premonition
that
something
will
happen
helen
was
very
superstitious
in
certain
ways
but
to
all
she
said
joe
only
laughed
i
going
to
do
the
big
swing
he
replied
simply
chapter
iii
too
many
people
hundreds
of
men
toiling
and
sweating
over
stiff
canvas
and
stiffer
ropes
the
thud
of
big
wooden
sledge
hammers
driving
in
the
tent
stakes
the
rumble
of
heavy
wagons
and
a
cloud
of
dust
where
they
were
being
shoved
into
place
by
the
busy
elephants
on
one
edge
of
the
big
vacant
lot
were
wisps
of
smoke
from
the
fires
in
the
stove
wagons
and
from
these
same
wagons
came
appetizing
odors
here
and
there
men
and
women
darted
carrying
portions
of
their
costumes
in
their
hands
clowns
partly
made
up
looked
from
their
dressing
tents
to
smile
or
shout
at
some
acquaintance
who
chanced
to
be
passing
by
all
this
was
the
sampson
brothers
circus
in
preparation
for
a
performance
joe
strong
having
had
a
good
breakfast
without
which
no
circus
man
or
woman
starts
the
day
strolled
over
to
where
helen
morton
was
just
finishing
her
morning
meal
feeling
all
right
he
asked
her
well
yes
pretty
well
she
answered
what
the
matter
asked
joe
quickly
as
he
detected
an
under
note
of
anxiety
in
the
girl
voice
is
your
star
horse
rosebud
lame
or
off
his
feed
oh
no
she
answered
it
just
oh
here
comes
mother
watson
and
i
promised
to
help
her
mend
a
skirt
said
helen
quickly
as
she
turned
to
greet
the
veteran
clown
wife
see
you
later
joe
she
called
to
him
over
her
shoulder
as
she
started
away
the
young
magician
moved
away
toward
his
own
private
quarters
i
wonder
what
the
matter
with
helen
he
said
she
does
act
naturally
if
that
bill
carfax
has
been
around
again
annoying
her
put
him
out
of
business
for
all
time
but
if
he
had
been
around
i
have
heard
of
it
i
do
believe
it
can
be
that
nor
was
it
helen
anxiety
had
to
do
with
something
other
than
bill
carfax
the
unprincipled
circus
man
who
had
so
annoyed
her
before
joe
discharged
him
and
as
joe
had
said
the
man
had
not
been
seen
publicly
since
the
fiasco
of
his
attempt
to
expose
joe
mystery
box
trick
well
i
suppose
she
wo
tell
me
what
it
is
until
she
gets
good
and
ready
mused
joe
now
i
go
in
and
have
a
little
practice
at
the
big
swing
before
the
parade
joe
did
not
take
part
in
the
street
pageant
though
helen
did
riding
her
beautiful
horse
to
the
admiration
not
only
of
the
small
boys
and
their
sisters
but
the
throng
in
the
highways
as
well
helen
made
a
striking
picture
on
her
spirited
but
gentle
steed
it
was
not
that
joe
strong
felt
above
appearing
in
the
parade
that
was
not
his
reason
for
not
taking
part
he
had
done
so
on
more
than
one
occasion
and
with
his
wings
of
steel
had
created
more
than
one
sensation
but
now
that
he
did
a
trapeze
act
as
well
as
working
the
mysteries
his
time
was
pretty
well
occupied
he
had
not
as
yet
done
the
big
swing
in
public
since
that
act
was
abandoned
on
the
death
of
the
man
who
had
been
injured
while
doing
it
but
joe
had
been
perfecting
himself
in
it
he
had
had
a
new
set
of
trapezes
made
and
had
ornamented
them
and
the
two
platforms
in
a
very
striking
manner
in
other
words
the
trick
had
a
new
dress
and
joe
as
one
of
the
circus
proprietors
hoped
it
would
go
well
and
attract
attention
this
was
from
a
business
standpoint
and
not
only
because
joe
was
himself
the
performer
of
course
it
was
natural
that
he
should
like
applause
all
do
more
or
less
but
joe
was
one
of
the
owners
of
the
circus
the
chief
owner
in
fact
and
he
wanted
to
make
a
financial
success
of
it
nor
was
this
a
purely
selfish
reason
many
persons
owned
stock
in
the
enterprise
and
joe
felt
it
was
only
fair
to
them
to
see
that
they
received
a
good
return
for
their
investment
any
trick
he
could
do
to
draw
crowds
he
was
willing
to
attempt
so
while
the
parade
was
being
gotten
ready
joe
went
inside
the
main
top
which
by
this
time
was
erected
to
see
about
having
his
platforms
and
trapeze
put
in
place
in
this
he
was
always
very
careful
as
is
every
aerial
performer
the
least
slip
of
a
rope
may
cause
disaster
and
no
matter
how
careful
the
attendants
are
the
performers
themselves
always
give
at
least
a
casual
look
to
their
apparatus
all
right
harry
asked
joe
of
one
of
the
riggers
who
had
charge
of
putting
up
the
platforms
and
the
big
swing
sure
it
all
right
mr
strong
was
the
answer
i
should
say
so
i
do
make
no
mistakes
when
i
putting
up
trapezes
you
find
everything
shipshape
and
proper
going
to
have
a
big
crowd
i
guess
joe
looked
at
harry
loper
closely
the
young
man
had
never
talked
so
much
before
being
on
the
whole
rather
as
the
man
passed
joe
after
giving
a
pull
on
the
last
rope
the
young
magician
became
aware
that
harry
had
been
drinking
and
something
stronger
than
pink
lemonade
i
sorry
about
that
mused
joe
as
the
rope
rigger
passed
on
if
there
any
place
a
man
ought
not
to
drink
it
in
a
circus
and
especially
when
he
has
to
rig
up
high
flying
apparatus
for
others
it
was
drink
that
put
bill
carfax
out
of
business
i
did
know
harry
was
that
kind
i
never
noticed
it
before
i
sorry
and
i
take
extra
precautions
that
my
ropes
wo
slip
you
ca
trust
a
man
who
drinks
joe
shook
his
head
a
bit
sadly
he
was
thinking
of
bill
carfax
and
of
the
fact
that
he
had
had
to
discharge
the
man
because
while
under
the
influence
of
liquor
he
had
insulted
helen
then
bill
had
tried
to
get
revenge
on
joe
i
hope
it
does
turn
out
this
way
with
harry
loper
mused
joe
as
he
began
climbing
up
a
rope
ladder
that
led
to
one
of
the
high
platforms
and
as
harry
had
to
do
with
the
placing
of
this
ladder
joe
tested
it
carefully
before
ascending
i
do
want
to
fall
and
be
laid
up
in
the
middle
of
the
circus
season
mused
the
young
circus
man
with
a
frown
however
the
ladder
appeared
to
be
perfectly
secure
and
as
joe
went
up
finally
reaching
the
high
platform
he
felt
a
sense
of
exhilaration
heights
always
affected
him
this
way
he
liked
more
than
anything
else
to
soar
aloft
on
his
wings
of
steel
and
he
liked
the
sensation
when
he
leaped
from
one
platform
toward
the
swinging
trapeze
bar
aiming
to
grasp
it
in
his
hands
and
swing
in
a
great
arc
to
the
other
little
elevated
place
close
under
the
top
of
the
tent
there
was
a
thrill
about
it
a
thrill
not
only
to
the
performer
but
to
the
audience
as
well
and
joe
could
hear
the
gasps
that
went
up
from
thousands
of
throats
as
he
made
his
big
swing
but
for
the
time
being
he
gave
his
whole
attention
to
the
platform
and
its
fastenings
the
platforms
were
not
very
likely
to
slip
being
caught
on
to
the
main
tent
poles
which
themselves
were
well
braced
the
real
danger
was
in
the
long
trapeze
not
only
must
the
thin
wire
ropes
of
this
be
strong
enough
to
hold
joe
weight
but
an
added
pressure
caused
by
the
momentum
of
his
jump
and
not
only
must
the
cables
be
strong
but
there
must
be
no
defect
in
the
wooden
bar
and
in
the
place
where
the
upper
ends
of
the
ropes
were
fastened
to
the
top
of
the
tent
well
this
platform
is
all
right
remarked
joe
as
he
looked
it
over
now
for
the
other
and
the
trapeze
he
went
down
the
rope
ladder
and
climbed
up
another
to
the
second
platform
the
show
would
not
start
for
several
hours
yet
and
the
tent
was
filled
with
men
putting
in
place
the
stage
for
joe
magic
tricks
and
other
apparatus
for
various
performers
the
parade
was
just
forming
to
proceed
down
town
joe
found
that
harry
loper
had
done
his
work
well
at
least
as
far
as
the
platforms
were
concerned
they
were
firmly
fastened
the
one
to
which
joe
leaped
after
his
swing
needed
to
be
considerably
stronger
than
the
one
from
which
he
took
off
the
next
act
of
the
young
circus
performer
was
to
climb
up
to
the
very
top
of
the
tent
and
there
to
examine
the
fastenings
of
the
trapeze
ropes
he
spent
some
time
at
this
having
reached
his
high
perch
by
a
third
rope
ladder
i
guess
everything
is
all
right
mused
joe
perhaps
i
did
harry
an
injustice
he
might
have
taken
some
stimulant
for
a
cold
they
all
got
wet
through
the
other
night
but
still
he
ought
to
be
careful
he
was
a
little
too
talkative
for
a
man
to
give
his
whole
attention
to
fastening
a
trapeze
but
this
seems
to
be
all
right
i
do
the
big
swing
this
afternoon
and
in
addition
to
the
box
trick
and
the
vanishing
lady
helen
works
exceedingly
well
in
that
having
seen
that
his
aerial
apparatus
was
all
right
joe
next
went
to
his
tent
where
his
magical
appliances
were
kept
many
stage
tricks
depend
for
their
success
on
special
pieces
of
apparatus
and
joe
acts
were
no
exception
joe
saw
that
everything
was
in
readiness
for
his
work
and
then
examined
his
box
of
mystery
as
this
was
a
very
special
piece
of
apparatus
he
was
very
careful
about
it
his
ability
to
get
out
of
it
once
he
was
locked
and
roped
in
depended
on
a
delicate
bit
of
mechanism
and
the
least
hitch
in
this
meant
failure
but
a
test
showed
that
it
was
all
right
and
as
by
this
time
it
was
nearly
the
hour
for
the
parade
to
come
back
and
the
preliminaries
to
begin
joe
went
over
to
the
circus
office
to
see
if
any
matters
there
needed
his
attention
as
he
crossed
the
lot
to
where
the
office
was
set
up
in
a
small
tent
the
first
horses
of
the
returning
parade
came
back
on
the
circus
grounds
following
was
a
mob
of
delighted
small
boys
and
not
a
few
men
looks
as
if
we
have
a
big
crowd
said
joe
to
himself
and
it
a
fine
day
for
the
show
we
make
money
he
attended
to
some
routine
matters
and
then
the
first
of
the
afternoon
audience
began
to
arrive
as
joe
had
predicted
the
crowd
was
a
big
one
the
young
performer
was
in
his
dressing
room
getting
ready
for
the
big
swing
which
he
would
perform
before
his
mystery
tricks
when
moyne
the
circus
treasurer
entered
there
was
a
queer
look
on
face
and
joe
could
not
help
but
notice
it
what
worrying
you
asked
joe
does
this
weather
suit
you
or
is
there
a
big
enough
crowd
that
just
it
joe
was
the
unexpected
answer
there
too
big
a
crowd
we
have
too
many
people
at
this
show
and
that
what
is
worrying
me
a
whole
lot
joe
strong
looked
in
surprise
at
the
treasurer
what
could
moyne
mean
chapter
iv
the
rusted
wire
yes
went
on
the
circus
treasurer
as
he
rubbed
his
chin
reflectively
it
a
curious
state
of
affairs
and
as
you
so
vitally
interested
i
came
to
you
at
once
there
going
to
be
trouble
trouble
cried
joe
with
a
laugh
i
ca
see
that
moyne
you
say
there
a
big
crowd
of
people
at
our
circus
too
much
of
a
crowd
in
fact
i
ca
see
anything
wrong
in
that
it
just
what
we
always
wanting
a
big
audience
let
fill
the
tent
i
say
and
put
out
the
seats
only
sign
trouble
why
i
should
say
this
was
good
luck
and
joe
hastened
his
preparations
for
he
wanted
to
go
on
with
the
big
swing
ordinarily
said
moyne
in
the
slow
precise
way
he
had
of
speaking
brought
about
perhaps
by
his
need
of
being
exact
in
money
matters
a
big
crowd
would
be
the
very
thing
we
should
want
but
this
time
we
do
not
this
kind
of
a
crowd
what
do
you
mean
asked
joe
beginning
to
feel
that
it
was
more
than
a
mere
notion
on
the
part
of
the
treasurer
that
something
was
wrong
is
it
a
rough
crowd
will
there
be
a
rube
cry
raised
a
fight
between
our
men
and
the
mill
hands
oh
no
nothing
like
that
the
treasurer
hastened
to
assure
joe
the
whole
thing
is
just
this
there
are
a
great
many
more
people
in
the
main
top
now
than
there
are
admission
prices
in
the
treasurer
cash
box
the
books
do
balance
as
it
were
more
people
in
the
tent
than
have
paid
their
way
asked
joe
well
that
always
happens
at
a
circus
small
boys
will
crawl
in
under
the
canvas
in
spite
of
clubs
oh
it
is
a
question
of
the
small
boys
i
never
worry
about
them
returned
moyne
but
there
are
about
a
thousand
more
persons
at
the
performance
which
will
soon
begin
than
we
have
admission
prices
for
in
other
words
there
are
a
thousand
persons
occupying
fifty
cent
seats
that
have
paid
their
half
dollar
it
is
the
reserve
chairs
that
are
affected
we
all
right
there
but
fully
a
thousand
persons
have
come
into
the
show
and
we
short
five
hundred
dollars
in
our
cash
you
do
tell
me
cried
joe
he
saw
that
moyne
was
very
much
in
earnest
have
the
ticket
men
and
the
entrance
attendants
been
working
a
game
on
us
oh
no
it
is
that
said
the
treasurer
i
could
understand
that
but
the
men
are
perfectly
willing
to
have
their
accounts
gone
over
and
their
tickets
checked
up
they
straight
then
what
is
it
asked
joe
that
what
we
got
to
find
out
went
on
moyne
in
some
way
the
thousand
people
have
come
in
without
paying
the
circus
anything
and
they
did
sneak
in
either
a
few
might
do
that
but
a
thousand
could
they
come
in
by
the
regular
entrance
did
they
force
themselves
past
without
tickets
no
each
one
had
the
proper
coupon
has
there
been
a
theft
of
our
tickets
demanded
the
young
magician
and
acrobat
no
our
ticket
account
is
all
right
except
there
are
a
thousand
extra
entrance
coupons
in
the
box
coupons
taken
in
by
the
entrance
attendants
it
a
puzzle
to
me
confessed
the
treasurer
there
is
some
game
being
played
on
us
and
we
out
to
the
tune
of
five
hundred
dollars
by
it
already
is
there
any
way
of
finding
out
who
these
persons
are
who
have
come
in
without
paying
us
and
having
them
ejected
asked
joe
i
do
see
how
admitted
moyne
if
they
were
in
reserved
seats
it
could
be
done
but
not
in
the
ordinary
fifty
cent
section
the
whole
situation
is
that
we
have
a
thousand
persons
too
many
at
the
show
well
we
have
a
meeting
of
the
executive
body
and
take
it
up
after
the
performance
said
joe
as
he
quickly
prepared
to
get
into
his
aerial
costume
we
have
to
go
on
with
the
performance
now
getting
late
if
we
swamped
by
people
coming
along
who
hold
our
regular
tickets
we
have
to
sit
anywhere
we
can
if
we
lose
five
hundred
dollars
we
make
it
up
by
having
a
smashing
crowd
which
is
always
a
good
advertisement
i
see
you
directly
after
the
show
mr
moyne
i
wish
you
would
said
the
harassed
treasurer
something
must
be
done
about
it
if
this
happens
very
often
we
be
in
a
financial
hole
at
the
end
of
the
season
he
departed
looking
at
some
figures
he
had
jotted
down
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
joe
strong
was
puzzled
nothing
like
this
had
ever
come
up
before
true
there
had
been
swindlers
who
tried
to
mulct
the
circus
of
money
and
there
were
always
small
boys
and
grown
men
too
who
tried
to
crawl
in
under
the
tent
but
such
a
wholesale
game
as
this
joe
had
never
before
known
well
five
hundred
dollars
for
once
wo
break
us
he
said
grimly
as
he
fastened
on
a
brightly
spangled
belt
but
i
would
want
it
to
happen
very
often
now
i
wonder
what
luck
i
have
in
my
big
swing
i
have
done
it
in
public
for
some
time
but
it
went
all
right
in
practice
joe
looked
from
his
dressing
room
he
was
all
ready
for
his
act
now
but
the
time
had
not
yet
come
for
him
to
go
on
he
saw
helen
hastening
past
on
her
way
to
enter
the
ring
with
her
horse
rosebud
which
a
groom
held
at
the
entrance
for
her
good
luck
called
joe
waving
his
hand
and
smiling
the
same
to
you
answered
helen
you
need
it
more
than
oh
joe
she
went
on
earnestly
wo
you
give
up
this
big
swing
stick
to
your
box
trick
and
let
me
act
with
you
in
the
disappearing
lady
stunt
do
go
on
with
this
high
trapeze
act
she
pleaded
why
helen
anybody
would
think
you
been
bitten
by
the
jinx
bug
laughed
joe
i
thought
you
were
all
over
that
perhaps
i
am
foolish
she
said
but
it
because
she
blushed
and
looked
away
i
suppose
i
should
take
it
as
a
compliment
that
you
are
so
interested
in
my
welfare
said
joe
with
a
smile
and
believe
me
i
am
but
helen
i
ca
back
out
of
this
act
now
it
been
advertised
big
got
to
go
on
then
do
be
careful
wo
you
she
begged
oh
do
be
careful
somehow
i
have
a
feeling
that
oh
well
i
wo
set
you
to
worrying
by
telling
you
she
said
quickly
with
a
laugh
in
which
however
there
was
no
mirth
she
smiled
again
trying
to
make
it
a
bright
one
but
joe
saw
that
she
was
under
a
strain
i
be
careful
he
promised
really
there
no
danger
i
done
the
stunt
a
score
of
times
and
i
can
judge
my
distance
perfectly
besides
there
the
safety
net
yes
i
know
but
there
was
poor
oh
well
i
wo
talk
about
it
good
luck
and
she
hurried
on
for
it
was
time
for
her
act
the
whistle
of
the
ringmaster
having
blown
joe
looked
after
the
girl
he
loved
he
smiled
and
then
a
rather
serious
look
settled
over
his
face
like
a
flash
there
had
come
to
him
the
memory
of
the
too
loquacious
harry
loper
who
had
fitted
up
his
aerial
apparatus
there
can
be
nothing
wrong
with
that
mused
joe
i
went
over
every
inch
of
it
i
guess
helen
is
just
nervous
well
there
goes
my
cue
he
hurried
toward
the
entrance
and
then
he
began
to
ponder
over
the
curious
fact
of
there
being
a
thousand
persons
too
many
at
the
performance
we
have
to
straighten
out
that
ticket
tangle
after
the
show
mused
joe
it
likely
to
get
serious
i
wonder
he
went
on
struck
by
a
new
thought
i
wonder
if
oh
no
it
could
be
he
has
been
around
in
a
long
while
out
into
the
tent
filled
with
a
crowd
went
joe
to
the
place
where
his
high
trapeze
was
waiting
for
him
the
band
was
playing
lively
airs
on
one
platform
some
trained
seals
were
juggling
big
balls
of
colored
rubber
and
on
another
a
bear
was
going
about
on
roller
skates
in
one
end
ring
helen
was
performing
with
rosebud
while
in
another
a
troupe
of
japanese
acrobats
were
doing
wonderful
things
with
their
supple
bodies
joe
waved
his
hand
to
helen
in
passing
and
then
he
began
to
ascend
to
his
high
platform
when
he
reached
it
and
stood
poised
ready
for
his
act
there
came
a
shrill
whistle
from
jim
tracy
the
ringmaster
who
wore
his
usual
immaculate
shirt
front
and
black
evening
clothes
rather
incongruous
in
the
daytime
the
whistle
was
the
signal
for
the
other
acts
to
cease
that
the
attention
of
all
might
be
centered
on
joe
this
is
always
done
in
a
circus
in
the
case
of
stars
and
joe
was
certainly
a
star
of
the
first
magnitude
ladies
and
gentlemen
cried
jim
tracy
with
the
accented
drawl
that
carried
his
voice
to
the
very
ends
of
the
big
tent
calling
your
attention
to
one
of
the
most
marvelous
high
trapeze
acts
ever
performed
in
any
circus
he
pointed
dramatically
to
joe
who
stood
up
straight
ready
to
do
his
act
are
you
ready
asked
the
man
who
was
to
release
the
trapeze
which
was
caught
up
at
one
side
of
the
platform
opposite
joe
ready
answered
the
young
acrobat
the
man
pulled
a
rope
which
released
a
catch
letting
the
trapeze
start
on
its
long
swaying
swing
the
man
pulled
it
by
means
of
a
long
thin
cord
until
it
was
making
big
arcs
like
some
gigantic
pendulum
joe
watched
it
carefully
judging
it
to
the
fraction
of
an
inch
he
stood
poised
and
tense
on
the
gayly
decorated
platform
himself
a
fine
picture
of
physical
young
manhood
the
band
was
blaring
out
the
latest
jazz
melody
suddenly
from
his
perch
the
young
acrobat
gave
a
cry
and
jim
tracy
on
the
ground
below
hearing
it
held
up
his
hand
as
a
signal
for
the
music
to
cease
then
joe
leaped
full
and
fair
he
leaped
out
toward
the
swinging
bar
of
the
big
trapeze
the
snare
drum
throbbing
out
as
he
jumped
he
was
dimly
conscious
of
thousands
of
eyes
watching
him
eyes
that
looked
curiously
and
apprehensively
up
and
he
realized
that
helen
was
also
watching
him
as
true
as
a
die
joe
hands
caught
and
gripped
the
bar
of
the
swinging
trapeze
so
far
he
was
safe
the
momentum
of
his
jump
carried
him
in
a
long
swing
and
he
at
once
began
to
undulate
himself
to
increase
his
swing
he
must
do
this
in
order
to
get
to
the
second
platform
as
the
young
performer
began
to
do
this
he
looked
up
at
the
wire
ropes
of
his
trapeze
it
was
a
look
given
instinctively
and
for
no
particular
purpose
as
joe
eyes
must
rest
most
of
all
on
the
second
platform
where
he
needed
to
land
to
save
himself
from
a
bad
fall
as
his
eyes
glanced
along
the
steel
cables
on
which
his
life
depended
he
saw
to
his
horror
a
spot
of
rust
on
one
and
at
the
spot
of
rust
several
of
the
thin
strands
of
twisted
wire
were
loose
and
frayed
the
cable
seemed
about
to
give
way
chapter
v
a
fire
sensation
joe
strong
had
to
think
quickly
every
acrobat
every
person
who
does
stunts
in
a
circus
must
for
something
is
always
happening
or
on
the
verge
of
taking
place
and
when
joe
looked
up
and
saw
the
rusted
wire
and
noted
the
fraying
strands
several
thoughts
shot
through
his
mind
at
once
that
rust
spot
was
there
this
morning
when
i
looked
at
the
trapeze
he
mused
and
it
has
rained
since
how
did
it
get
there
he
thought
of
the
too
talkative
harry
loper
and
an
ugly
suspicion
associated
itself
with
him
but
joe
had
no
time
for
such
thoughts
then
what
was
vital
for
him
to
know
was
whether
or
not
the
thin
wire
cable
would
remain
unbroken
long
enough
for
him
to
reach
the
maximum
of
his
swing
and
land
on
the
platform
or
would
he
fall
spoiling
the
act
and
also
endangering
himself
true
he
might
land
in
the
net
in
such
a
way
as
to
come
to
no
harm
as
he
had
done
many
times
and
as
many
performers
before
him
had
done
but
the
danger
was
that
in
a
sudden
and
unexpected
drop
downward
he
might
not
be
able
to
get
his
limbs
in
the
proper
landing
position
joe
strong
had
nerve
if
he
had
lacked
it
he
would
never
have
been
so
successful
and
at
once
he
decided
on
a
courageous
proceeding
i
bring
all
my
weight
suddenly
on
that
left
hand
cable
he
mused
as
he
swung
to
and
fro
from
side
to
side
of
the
big
tent
if
going
to
break
it
will
do
so
then
and
i
be
ready
for
it
i
then
keep
hold
of
the
trapeze
bar
which
will
be
straight
up
and
down
instead
of
crosswise
and
swing
by
that
the
other
cable
seems
all
right
this
was
a
fact
which
joe
ascertained
by
a
quick
inspection
there
was
no
time
for
further
thought
as
he
swung
joe
suddenly
shifted
his
weight
bringing
it
all
on
the
frayed
and
strangely
rusted
cable
as
he
half
expected
it
gave
way
and
he
dropped
in
an
instant
but
not
far
the
watching
crowd
gasped
it
looked
like
an
accident
and
it
was
in
a
way
but
joe
had
purposely
caused
it
as
the
wire
broke
joe
held
tightly
to
the
wooden
bar
which
was
now
upright
in
his
hands
instead
of
being
horizontal
and
though
it
slipped
through
his
fingers
perhaps
for
the
width
of
his
palm
at
last
he
gripped
it
in
a
firm
hold
and
kept
on
with
his
swing
and
then
the
applause
broke
forth
for
the
audience
thought
it
all
a
part
of
the
trick
they
thought
that
joe
had
purposely
caused
the
cable
to
break
to
make
the
act
more
effective
to
and
fro
swung
joe
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
second
platform
and
then
reaching
the
height
of
the
long
arc
he
turned
his
body
and
stepped
full
and
fair
on
the
little
square
of
boards
with
a
lithe
contortion
joe
squirmed
to
an
upright
position
recovering
his
balance
with
a
great
effort
for
he
had
been
put
out
in
his
calculations
of
distance
and
then
turning
he
bowed
to
the
crowds
revolving
on
the
platform
to
take
in
every
one
again
the
applause
broke
forth
to
be
drowned
in
the
boom
and
ruffle
of
the
drums
as
the
band
began
to
play
there
is
little
time
in
a
circus
where
act
follows
act
so
quickly
for
long
acknowledgments
the
other
performers
came
into
the
rings
or
on
to
the
raised
platforms
and
joe
descended
by
means
of
the
rope
ladder
helen
met
him
and
they
walked
toward
the
dressing
rooms
that
was
a
wonderful
trick
joe
she
said
but
i
did
see
you
practice
that
drop
i
did
practice
it
he
remarked
dryly
i
did
it
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
joe
strong
was
it
dangerous
well
a
little
what
made
you
do
it
i
could
help
it
you
could
help
it
joe
do
you
mean
she
sensed
that
something
was
wrong
but
walking
around
the
circus
arena
with
performers
coming
and
going
was
not
the
place
to
speak
of
it
joe
saw
that
she
understood
i
tell
you
later
he
said
we
have
to
get
ready
for
the
trick
box
and
the
vanishing
lady
stunt
now
oh
joe
were
you
in
much
danger
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
oh
not
much
he
answered
and
he
tried
to
speak
lightly
yet
he
did
not
like
to
think
of
that
one
moment
when
he
saw
the
rusted
and
broken
wire
while
joe
and
helen
are
preparing
for
the
box
act
which
has
been
treated
fully
in
the
previous
volume
the
explanation
of
how
the
vanishing
lady
trick
was
accomplished
will
be
given
though
that
too
has
been
explained
in
an
earlier
volume
a
large
newspaper
is
put
on
the
stage
and
the
chair
set
on
the
paper
thus
seemingly
precluding
the
possibility
of
a
trap
door
being
cut
in
the
stage
through
which
the
lady
in
the
chair
might
slip
the
word
seemingly
is
used
with
a
due
sense
of
what
it
means
the
newspaper
was
not
a
perfect
one
on
one
of
its
sides
which
was
not
exhibited
to
the
audience
there
was
cut
an
opening
or
trap
that
exactly
corresponded
in
size
with
a
trap
door
on
the
stage
the
paper
as
explained
in
the
previous
book
is
strengthened
with
cardboard
and
the
trap
is
a
double
one
being
cut
in
the
center
the
flaps
being
easily
moved
either
way
the
audience
thinks
it
sees
a
perfect
newspaper
but
there
is
a
square
hole
in
it
but
concealed
as
is
a
secret
trap
door
when
joe
laid
the
paper
on
the
stage
he
placed
it
so
that
the
square
double
flap
in
it
was
exactly
over
the
trap
in
the
stage
floor
he
then
drew
the
page
of
the
paper
that
he
had
held
out
to
the
audience
toward
himself
exposing
the
trap
for
use
but
because
it
was
so
carefully
made
and
the
cut
was
so
fine
it
was
not
visible
from
the
front
helen
took
her
place
in
the
chair
which
of
course
was
a
trick
one
it
was
fitted
with
a
concealed
rod
and
a
cap
and
it
was
over
this
cap
brought
out
at
the
proper
moment
that
joe
carefully
placed
the
black
veil
when
he
was
pretending
to
mesmerize
helen
there
was
a
cross
rod
also
concealed
in
the
chair
and
on
either
end
of
this
something
like
the
epaulettes
of
a
soldier
so
that
when
these
ends
were
under
the
veil
and
the
cap
was
in
place
it
looked
as
though
some
one
sat
in
the
chair
when
really
no
one
did
helen
was
in
the
chair
at
the
start
but
as
soon
as
she
was
covered
by
the
veil
she
began
to
get
out
the
seat
of
the
chair
was
hinged
within
its
frame
as
helen
sat
on
it
and
after
she
had
been
covered
with
the
veil
she
rested
her
weight
on
her
hands
which
were
placed
on
the
extreme
outer
edges
of
this
seat
frame
she
pulled
a
catch
which
caused
the
seat
to
drop
and
at
the
same
time
the
trap
beneath
her
including
the
prepared
newspaper
was
opened
by
an
attendant
the
black
veil
all
about
the
chair
prevented
the
audience
seeing
this
helen
lowered
herself
down
through
the
dropped
seat
of
the
chair
through
the
trap
and
under
the
stage
and
while
she
was
doing
this
it
still
looked
as
if
she
were
in
the
chair
for
the
false
cap
and
the
extended
cross
rod
made
outlines
as
if
of
a
human
form
beneath
the
black
veil
as
soon
as
helen
was
out
of
the
chair
and
beneath
the
stage
an
attendant
closed
the
newspaper
and
wooden
floor
traps
joe
then
suddenly
raised
the
veil
taking
in
its
folds
the
false
cap
and
the
cross
piece
which
had
represented
helen
shoulders
they
were
thin
and
light
these
pieces
of
trick
apparatus
and
no
one
suspected
they
were
in
the
veil
the
hinged
seat
of
the
chair
snapped
back
in
place
by
means
of
a
spring
and
when
joe
stepped
aside
holding
the
veil
there
was
the
empty
chair
and
the
newspaper
which
he
picked
up
seemed
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
there
having
been
a
trap
in
the
stage
but
joe
was
careful
how
he
exhibited
this
paper
to
his
audience
and
so
it
was
that
the
lady
vanished
and
now
joe
tell
me
all
about
it
demanded
helen
when
the
circus
was
over
for
the
afternoon
and
the
box
and
vanishing
tricks
had
been
successfully
performed
what
happened
to
your
trapeze
some
one
spilled
acid
on
one
of
the
wire
ropes
and
it
ate
into
the
metal
corroding
it
and
separating
a
number
of
the
strands
so
that
a
little
extra
weight
broke
them
said
joe
acid
on
the
cable
cried
helen
how
did
you
find
out
i
just
examined
the
wire
i
knew
it
could
have
rusted
naturally
in
such
a
short
time
there
was
a
peculiar
smell
about
the
wire
and
i
know
enough
of
chemistry
to
make
a
simple
acid
test
what
kind
of
acid
was
used
i
do
know
but
it
was
strong
enough
to
eat
the
steel
who
could
have
put
it
on
that
i
got
to
find
out
was
it
harry
loper
i
taxed
him
with
it
but
he
swears
he
knew
nothing
of
it
said
joe
i
inclined
to
believe
him
too
i
charged
him
with
drinking
and
he
could
not
deny
that
but
he
said
he
met
some
old
friends
and
they
induced
him
to
have
a
little
convivial
time
with
them
no
i
believe
he
do
it
he
weak
and
foolish
but
he
had
no
reason
to
try
to
injure
me
who
would
joe
of
course
there
bill
carfax
but
he
has
been
seen
near
the
circus
of
late
no
i
do
believe
it
could
have
been
bill
i
have
to
be
on
my
guard
do
joe
urged
helen
oh
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
it
do
then
laughed
joe
trying
to
make
light
of
it
let
go
down
town
and
i
buy
you
some
ice
cream
but
you
not
going
to
give
up
trying
to
find
out
who
put
acid
on
the
trapeze
are
you
no
indeed
declared
the
young
performer
i
have
two
problems
on
my
hands
now
that
and
trying
to
learn
how
too
many
persons
came
to
the
circus
this
afternoon
and
he
told
helen
about
the
extra
tickets
that
queer
she
exclaimed
some
jinx
bug
must
be
after
us
do
get
superstitious
warned
joe
now
we
forget
our
troubles
they
may
not
amount
to
anything
after
all
but
though
he
spoke
lightly
joe
was
worried
and
he
was
not
going
to
let
helen
know
that
they
went
into
an
parlor
and
relaxed
as
helen
called
it
the
two
were
on
their
way
back
to
the
circus
lot
intending
to
go
to
supper
and
prepare
for
the
evening
entertainment
when
there
was
a
sudden
alarm
down
the
street
and
in
an
instant
the
fire
engines
and
other
apparatus
dashed
past
a
fire
cried
joe
come
on
helen
it
just
down
the
street
they
could
see
smoke
pouring
from
a
small
building
and
a
crowd
rushing
toward
it
thither
also
the
fire
apparatus
was
dashing
joe
and
helen
were
among
the
early
arrivals
what
is
it
asked
joe
of
an
officer
i
mean
what
sort
of
place
is
that
and
he
pointed
to
the
building
which
was
now
obscured
by
smoke
dime
museum
was
the
answer
lot
of
fakes
i
sent
in
the
alarm
a
was
trying
some
new
stunt
and
he
set
the
place
ablaze
so
the
boss
yelled
to
me
come
now
youse
all
have
to
git
back
and
he
motioned
to
the
crowd
which
was
constantly
increasing
to
get
beyond
the
fire
lines
chapter
vi
something
new
what
with
the
clanging
of
the
gongs
on
the
engines
and
on
the
red
runabouts
that
brought
two
battalion
chiefs
to
the
fire
the
pall
of
smoke
with
here
and
there
the
suggestion
of
a
red
blaze
the
swaying
excitement
of
the
crowd
the
yells
of
harassed
policemen
the
scene
at
the
blaze
of
the
dime
museum
was
one
long
to
be
remembered
by
joe
strong
and
helen
morton
particularly
in
the
light
of
what
happened
afterward
joe
did
you
hear
what
he
said
asked
helen
as
she
moved
back
with
the
young
acrobat
in
conformity
with
the
officer
order
you
mean
that
we
got
to
slide
no
that
a
started
the
blaze
does
he
mean
a
professional
bug
as
i
have
heard
them
called
oh
not
at
all
exclaimed
joe
a
is
a
chap
who
does
such
stunts
in
a
museum
theater
or
even
in
a
circus
sampson
brothers
used
to
have
one
i
understand
from
looking
over
the
old
books
but
it
was
much
of
an
act
golly
this
is
going
to
be
some
blaze
that
was
very
evident
from
the
increased
smoke
that
rolled
out
and
the
crackle
of
fire
that
now
could
be
heard
above
the
puffing
of
the
engines
and
the
shouts
of
the
mob
a
regular
tinder
box
muttered
the
officer
who
had
told
joe
the
origin
of
the
blaze
place
ought
to
have
been
pulled
down
long
ago
git
back
there
youse
he
yelled
to
some
venturesome
lads
want
to
git
mushed
up
the
blaze
was
a
big
one
considerable
damage
was
done
and
several
persons
were
injured
but
quick
work
by
an
efficient
department
prevented
the
flames
from
spreading
to
the
buildings
on
either
side
of
the
one
where
it
had
started
joe
and
helen
stayed
long
enough
to
see
the
menace
gotten
under
control
and
then
they
departed
just
as
the
ambulance
rolled
away
with
the
last
of
the
victims
that
the
they
taking
to
the
hospital
now
said
the
policeman
who
had
first
spoken
to
the
young
circus
performers
they
took
him
into
a
drug
store
to
wrap
him
in
oil
and
cotton
batting
will
he
live
asked
helen
just
a
chance
was
the
answer
say
if
i
had
to
get
my
living
eating
fire
i
starve
confided
the
policeman
it
must
be
some
stunt
i
always
thought
it
was
a
fake
but
this
fire
burned
real
enough
oh
it
is
all
fake
said
joe
though
of
course
there
a
trick
about
it
you
seem
to
know
said
the
policeman
and
he
smiled
at
joe
and
helen
his
chief
troubles
were
about
over
with
the
departure
of
the
ambulance
and
the
knowledge
that
filtered
through
the
crowd
that
the
most
of
the
excitement
was
over
oh
i
in
the
circus
business
confessed
joe
i
never
ate
fire
he
went
on
but
oh
i
know
you
now
cried
the
officer
i
was
on
duty
out
at
the
circus
grounds
this
afternoon
and
i
went
into
the
tent
when
you
did
that
box
act
say
that
some
stunt
do
they
really
pay
ten
thousand
dollars
to
the
fellow
who
tells
how
it
done
well
we
never
paid
out
the
money
yet
said
joe
with
a
smile
but
it
there
waiting
for
some
one
to
claim
it
then
i
coming
to
watch
you
said
the
officer
who
appeared
delighted
that
he
had
recognized
one
of
the
profesh
come
along
replied
joe
here
wait
a
minute
there
are
a
couple
of
passes
come
and
bring
a
friend
if
you
tell
how
i
do
the
trick
get
the
ten
thousand
only
you
have
to
post
a
hundred
dollars
as
a
forfeit
to
the
red
cross
in
case
you
do
guess
right
that
included
in
the
offer
oh
the
officer
did
not
seem
quite
so
pleased
well
i
come
anyhow
he
went
on
accepting
the
passes
joe
handed
him
the
policeman
had
allowed
joe
and
helen
to
stay
in
an
advantageous
place
where
they
could
watch
the
fire
where
are
they
taking
the
man
who
did
the
dangerous
trick
that
caused
all
the
trouble
asked
helen
as
she
prepared
to
walk
on
with
joe
to
the
city
hospital
miss
he
a
bad
case
i
understand
poor
fellow
murmured
helen
do
you
think
we
could
go
to
see
him
and
do
something
for
him
joe
she
asked
solicitously
he
in
almost
the
same
line
of
business
as
ourselves
well
i
do
know
was
the
slow
answer
i
can
fix
it
up
if
you
want
to
see
him
that
is
if
the
doctors
and
nurses
will
let
you
said
the
policeman
i
know
the
hospital
superintendent
you
just
tell
him
that
casey
sent
you
and
it
will
be
all
right
thanks
perhaps
we
will
said
joe
there
was
a
little
time
after
supper
before
the
performers
had
to
go
on
with
their
acts
and
helen
prevailed
on
joe
to
take
her
to
the
hospital
whither
the
injured
had
been
removed
they
found
him
swathed
in
bandages
no
objection
being
made
to
their
seeing
him
after
the
magic
name
of
casey
had
been
mentioned
to
the
superintendent
we
came
in
to
see
if
you
needed
any
help
said
joe
to
the
pathetic
figure
in
the
bed
we
in
the
same
line
of
business
in
a
way
are
you
a
slowly
asked
the
man
no
joe
told
him
but
i
in
the
circus
sampson
brothers
oh
yes
i
heard
about
it
a
partner
of
mine
was
with
for
years
gascoyne
was
his
name
that
was
before
my
time
said
joe
but
how
are
you
getting
on
can
we
be
of
any
help
to
you
we
professionals
must
help
one
another
that
right
we
get
knocked
often
enough
was
the
reply
well
doing
as
well
as
can
be
expected
the
doctor
says
and
i
not
really
in
need
of
anything
the
museum
folks
were
pretty
good
to
me
thank
you
just
the
same
how
did
it
happen
asked
helen
oh
just
my
carelessness
said
the
man
we
get
careless
after
playing
with
fire
a
bit
i
put
too
much
alcohol
on
the
tow
and
there
was
a
draft
from
an
open
door
some
draperies
caught
and
it
was
all
going
before
i
knew
it
i
tried
to
put
it
out
that
how
i
got
burned
then
you
really
did
eat
fire
asked
helen
joe
and
the
man
swathed
in
bandages
looked
at
one
another
and
a
semblance
of
a
wink
passed
between
them
nobody
can
eat
fire
lady
said
the
museum
performer
it
all
a
trick
same
as
some
your
husband
does
in
the
circus
joe
blushed
almost
as
much
as
did
helen
we
not
married
yet
but
we
going
to
be
explained
joe
smiling
lucky
guy
murmured
the
man
well
as
i
was
saying
it
all
a
trick
he
went
on
strong
alum
solution
in
your
mouth
just
a
dash
of
alcohol
to
make
a
blaze
that
flares
up
but
goes
out
quickly
if
you
smother
it
right
you
know
the
game
and
he
looked
at
joe
well
not
exactly
was
the
reply
i
read
something
of
it
but
somehow
it
never
appealed
to
me
oh
it
makes
a
good
act
friend
said
the
man
earnestly
i
done
a
lot
of
museum
and
circus
stunts
and
this
always
goes
big
there
no
danger
if
you
handle
it
right
i
be
more
careful
next
time
you
do
mean
to
say
you
go
back
to
it
do
you
asked
helen
sure
lady
i
got
to
earn
my
living
and
this
is
the
best
thing
i
know
i
be
out
in
a
week
i
did
swallow
any
thank
goodness
oh
sure
i
go
at
it
again
joe
and
helen
cheered
the
sufferer
up
as
much
as
they
could
and
then
departed
joe
privately
left
a
bill
of
substantial
denomination
with
the
superintendent
to
be
used
for
anything
extra
the
patient
might
need
on
the
way
back
to
the
circus
where
they
were
soon
to
give
their
evening
performance
joe
was
unusually
quiet
what
the
matter
asked
helen
are
you
thinking
of
that
accident
on
the
trapeze
no
was
the
answer
it
something
different
i
got
to
get
up
a
new
act
for
the
show
that
trapeze
act
even
the
way
i
had
to
do
it
this
afternoon
is
sensational
enough
i
got
to
have
something
new
and
i
about
decided
on
it
what
asked
helen
i
going
to
become
a
was
the
unexpected
reply
chapter
vii
the
paper
expert
for
a
moment
helen
morton
stared
at
joe
strong
as
though
not
quite
sure
whether
or
not
he
was
in
his
proper
mind
then
seeing
plainly
that
he
was
in
earnest
she
seemed
to
shrink
away
from
him
as
he
had
noticed
her
shrink
away
for
a
moment
from
the
burned
man
suffering
there
in
the
hospital
what
the
matter
helen
asked
joe
trying
to
speak
lightly
you
want
to
see
some
more
sensational
acts
in
the
show
yes
but
not
that
kind
she
answered
with
a
shudder
she
could
not
conceal
oh
joe
if
you
were
to
she
could
not
go
on
her
breast
heaved
painfully
now
look
here
helen
he
exclaimed
with
roughness
that
is
any
way
to
look
at
matters
especially
when
we
both
depend
on
sensations
for
making
our
living
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
in
this
business
we
have
to
take
risks
that
what
makes
our
acts
go
you
take
a
risk
every
time
you
perform
with
rosebud
you
might
slip
the
horse
might
slip
and
you
be
hurt
now
is
this
new
act
i
am
thinking
of
perfor
yes
i
may
take
risks
joe
interrupted
helen
but
they
are
perfectly
natural
risks
and
i
have
more
than
an
even
chance
you
might
just
as
well
say
you
take
a
risk
walking
along
the
street
and
so
you
do
an
elevated
train
might
fall
on
you
or
an
auto
run
up
on
the
sidewalk
the
risks
i
take
in
the
act
with
rosebud
are
only
natural
ones
and
really
should
be
counted
but
if
you
start
to
become
a
oh
joe
think
of
that
poor
fellow
in
the
hospital
he
did
get
that
way
from
eating
fire
or
pretending
to
eat
it
for
the
amusement
of
the
public
he
might
just
as
easily
have
been
burned
the
way
he
is
by
lighting
the
kitchen
stove
for
his
wife
to
get
breakfast
his
accident
was
entirely
outside
of
his
act
you
might
say
why
i
use
lighted
candles
in
some
of
my
tricks
now
if
some
one
knocked
over
a
candle
and
it
caused
a
fire
on
the
stage
and
i
was
burned
would
you
want
me
to
give
up
being
a
magician
oh
no
i
suppose
not
said
helen
slowly
but
fire
is
so
dangerous
and
to
think
of
putting
it
in
your
mouth
how
can
you
do
it
joe
oh
it
ca
be
done
oh
there
a
trick
about
it
i
have
mastered
all
the
details
yet
so
as
to
give
a
smooth
performance
but
i
can
make
an
attempt
at
it
joe
strong
do
you
mean
to
say
you
know
how
to
eat
fire
demanded
helen
and
now
her
eyes
showed
her
astonishment
well
not
exactly
eat
it
though
that
is
the
term
used
but
i
do
know
how
to
do
it
i
learned
in
a
rudimentary
way
when
i
was
with
professor
rosello
the
first
man
who
taught
me
he
had
one
act
but
it
did
amount
to
much
he
told
me
the
secret
of
it
such
as
it
was
but
if
i
put
on
that
stunt
i
going
to
make
it
different
i
going
to
dress
it
up
make
it
sensational
so
that
it
will
be
the
talk
of
the
country
where
circuses
are
exhibited
and
wo
you
run
any
danger
questioned
the
girl
quickly
oh
i
suppose
so
just
as
i
do
when
i
work
on
the
high
trapeze
or
ride
my
motor
cycle
along
the
high
wire
but
it
all
in
the
day
work
and
now
let
talk
about
something
pleasant
i
mean
let
get
off
the
shop
helen
sighed
she
was
plainly
disturbed
but
she
did
not
want
to
burden
joe
with
her
worries
she
knew
he
must
have
calm
nerves
and
an
untroubled
mind
to
do
his
various
acts
in
the
circus
that
night
after
supper
and
before
the
evening
performance
joe
made
a
careful
examination
of
his
trapeze
apparatus
beyond
the
place
where
the
acid
had
eaten
into
the
wire
strands
causing
them
to
become
weakened
so
that
they
parted
the
appliances
did
not
appear
to
have
been
tampered
with
nor
were
there
any
clews
which
might
show
who
had
done
the
deed
that
it
could
have
happened
by
accident
was
out
of
the
question
the
acid
could
have
gotten
on
the
wire
rope
in
one
way
only
some
one
must
have
climbed
up
the
rope
ladder
to
the
platform
and
applied
the
stuff
but
who
did
it
asked
jim
tracy
when
joe
had
told
him
of
the
discovery
of
the
cable
some
enemy
perhaps
the
same
one
who
was
responsible
for
our
loss
in
tickets
this
afternoon
answered
the
young
magician
carfax
asked
the
ringmaster
it
might
be
and
yet
he
is
the
only
man
who
been
discharged
or
who
has
a
grudge
against
me
there
was
gianni
with
whom
i
had
a
fight
you
mean
the
italian
yes
he
was
an
ugly
customer
but
i
have
heard
of
him
for
years
i
do
believe
he
even
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
we
have
any
reason
to
suppose
that
carfax
is
either
after
his
fiasco
in
trying
to
expose
my
box
of
mystery
trick
but
we
got
to
be
on
our
guard
i
should
say
so
exclaimed
the
ringmaster
and
now
about
your
trapeze
act
joe
are
you
going
to
put
it
on
again
of
course
it
billed
then
you
have
to
hustle
to
rig
up
a
new
rope
i
not
going
to
put
on
a
new
rope
declared
joe
the
act
went
so
well
when
i
seemed
about
to
fall
that
i
going
to
keep
that
feature
in
i
rig
up
a
catch
on
the
severed
cable
at
the
proper
time
snap
it
loose
seem
to
fall
swing
by
the
dangling
bar
as
i
did
before
and
land
on
the
platform
that
way
it
will
be
more
effective
than
if
i
did
it
in
the
regular
way
but
wo
it
be
risky
joe
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
more
so
than
any
trapeze
act
now
that
i
ready
for
the
sudden
drop
i
be
on
my
guard
no
i
can
work
it
all
right
and
now
about
these
extra
admissions
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
them
well
said
the
ringmaster
maybe
we
better
talk
to
moyne
about
them
if
they
ring
an
extra
thousand
persons
in
on
us
again
the
thing
will
be
getting
serious
the
treasurer
was
called
in
consultation
with
joe
and
tracy
and
other
circus
officials
and
it
was
decided
to
keep
a
special
watch
on
the
ticket
wagon
and
the
ticket
takers
that
night
joe
quickly
made
the
change
in
his
trapeze
and
tested
it
finding
that
he
could
work
it
perfectly
then
he
began
to
think
of
his
new
act
he
was
determined
to
make
that
as
great
a
success
as
was
his
now
well
advertised
ten
thousand
dollar
mystery
box
act
the
evening
performance
had
not
long
been
under
way
and
joe
had
done
his
big
swing
successfully
when
he
was
sought
out
by
moyne
the
same
thing
has
happened
again
said
the
treasurer
you
mean
more
people
coming
in
than
we
have
sold
tickets
for
that
it
well
where
do
the
extra
admissions
come
from
i
mean
where
do
the
people
get
their
admission
slips
from
the
extra
people
that
what
we
ca
find
out
the
treasurer
aid
as
far
as
the
ticket
takers
can
tell
only
one
kind
of
admission
slip
for
the
fifty
cent
seats
is
being
handed
them
but
the
number
as
tallied
by
the
automatic
gates
does
not
jibe
with
the
number
of
ordinary
admissions
sold
at
the
ticket
office
there
is
a
difference
of
about
eight
hundred
and
do
you
mean
asked
joe
that
that
number
of
persons
came
in
on
tickets
that
were
never
sold
at
the
ticket
wagon
that
just
what
i
mean
there
is
an
extra
source
from
which
the
ordinary
admission
tickets
come
as
i
told
you
this
afternoon
we
are
having
no
trouble
with
our
reserved
seats
there
have
been
no
duplicates
there
but
there
is
a
duplication
in
the
fifty
cent
seats
where
one
may
take
his
pick
as
to
where
he
wants
to
sit
do
we
have
tickets
on
sale
in
some
of
the
downtown
stores
joe
asked
oh
yes
several
of
the
stores
sell
tickets
up
to
a
certain
hour
then
they
send
the
balance
up
here
for
us
to
dispose
of
how
about
their
accounts
have
you
had
them
gone
over
carefully
they
tally
to
a
penny
how
about
the
unsold
tickets
these
agents
send
back
to
us
is
there
a
chance
on
the
way
up
for
some
one
to
slip
out
some
of
the
pasteboards
mr
moyne
there
is
a
chance
yes
but
it
has
been
done
i
have
checked
up
the
accounts
of
the
stores
and
there
is
the
cash
or
the
unsold
tickets
to
balance
every
time
but
somehow
and
from
some
place
an
extra
number
of
the
ordinary
admission
tickets
are
being
sold
and
we
are
not
getting
the
money
for
them
it
is
queer
said
joe
i
have
an
idea
that
i
want
to
try
out
the
first
chance
i
get
save
me
a
bunch
of
these
ordinary
admission
tickets
take
them
from
the
boxes
at
random
and
let
me
have
them
i
will
promised
the
treasurer
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
to
stop
the
fraud
is
there
he
asked
moyne
was
a
very
conscientious
treasurer
it
disturbed
him
greatly
to
see
the
circus
lose
money
i
do
see
what
we
can
do
said
joe
if
we
start
an
inquiry
it
may
cause
a
fight
let
it
go
we
have
to
charge
it
to
profit
and
loss
and
do
forget
to
let
me
have
some
of
those
tickets
i
want
to
examine
them
moyne
promised
to
attend
to
the
matter
joe
then
had
to
go
on
in
his
box
of
mystery
trick
and
when
this
was
finished
amid
much
applause
he
caused
helen
to
vanish
in
the
manner
already
described
the
circus
made
considerable
money
in
this
town
even
with
the
bogus
admissions
and
as
the
weather
was
fine
and
as
the
show
would
exhibit
the
next
day
in
a
big
city
for
a
two
days
stand
every
one
was
in
good
humor
staying
over
night
in
the
same
city
where
they
exhibited
during
the
day
was
always
a
rest
for
the
performers
they
got
more
sleep
and
were
in
better
trim
for
work
the
last
act
was
finished
the
chariot
races
had
taken
place
and
the
audience
was
surging
out
the
animal
tent
had
already
been
taken
down
and
the
animals
themselves
were
being
loaded
on
the
railroad
train
as
joe
helen
and
the
other
performers
started
for
their
berths
to
begin
the
trip
to
the
next
town
the
main
top
began
coming
down
the
circus
was
on
the
move
soon
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
having
seen
that
all
his
apparatus
had
safely
arrived
joe
visited
moyne
in
the
office
have
you
a
bunch
of
tickets
for
me
asked
the
young
magician
yes
here
they
are
several
hundred
picked
at
random
from
the
boxes
at
the
entrance
i
ca
see
anything
wrong
if
you
looking
for
counterfeit
tickets
i
do
believe
you
find
them
added
moyne
i
do
know
that
i
am
looking
for
counterfeits
said
joe
that
may
be
the
explanation
or
it
may
be
there
is
a
leak
somewhere
in
the
ticket
wagon
i
almost
sure
there
is
declared
the
treasurer
but
of
course
no
one
is
infallible
i
hope
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
i
hope
so
myself
replied
joe
with
a
smile
as
he
put
the
tickets
in
a
valise
a
little
later
he
was
on
his
way
downtown
he
had
several
hours
before
he
would
have
to
go
on
as
he
did
not
take
part
in
the
parade
and
he
had
several
matters
to
attend
to
joe
made
his
way
toward
a
large
office
building
carrying
the
valise
with
the
circus
tickets
a
little
later
he
might
have
been
seen
entering
an
office
the
door
of
which
bore
the
name
of
herbert
waldon
consulting
chemist
strong
said
joe
to
the
boy
who
came
forward
to
inquire
his
errand
waldon
is
expecting
me
i
believe
oh
yes
said
the
boy
you
to
come
right
in
joe
was
ushered
into
a
room
which
was
filled
with
strange
appliances
from
test
tubes
and
retorts
to
electrical
furnaces
and
apparatus
a
little
man
in
a
rather
soiled
linen
coat
came
forward
smiling
i
wo
shake
hands
with
you
strong
he
said
for
i
been
dabbling
in
some
stuff
but
if
you
wait
until
i
wash
be
right
with
you
all
right
assented
joe
and
then
as
he
caught
sight
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
number
of
canceled
bank
checks
on
a
table
he
smilingly
asked
have
you
been
paying
your
income
tax
oh
no
answered
the
chemist
with
a
laugh
those
are
just
some
samples
of
paper
sent
in
for
me
to
test
an
inventor
is
trying
to
get
up
an
ink
i
a
sort
of
paper
expert
among
my
other
chemical
activities
and
i
putting
these
samples
through
a
series
of
tests
but
you
not
be
interested
in
them
i
do
know
but
what
i
shall
be
returned
joe
with
sudden
energy
since
you
are
a
paper
expert
i
may
be
able
to
set
you
another
task
besides
that
of
showing
me
the
latest
thing
in
liquids
yes
i
may
want
your
services
in
both
lines
well
i
here
to
do
business
said
waldon
smiling
chapter
viii
joe
eats
fire
the
chemist
led
the
way
into
a
little
office
this
opened
off
from
the
room
in
which
was
the
apparatus
and
where
as
joe
had
become
more
and
more
keenly
aware
there
was
a
most
unpleasant
odor
i
open
the
window
close
the
laboratory
door
and
you
wo
notice
it
in
a
little
while
said
waldon
as
he
observed
joe
nose
twitching
i
so
used
to
it
i
do
mind
but
you
coming
in
from
the
fresh
air
it
is
exactly
perfume
interrupted
joe
with
a
laugh
but
do
be
uneasy
on
my
account
i
can
stand
it
however
he
was
glad
when
the
fresh
air
came
in
through
the
window
the
chemist
washed
his
hands
and
then
sat
down
at
a
desk
inviting
joe
to
draw
up
his
chair
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
asked
waldon
is
it
fire
or
paper
well
since
i
know
pretty
well
what
i
want
to
ask
you
in
the
matter
of
fire
replied
joe
and
since
i
got
a
puzzling
paper
problem
here
suppose
we
tackle
the
hardest
first
and
come
to
the
known
and
easier
trick
later
just
as
you
say
assented
waldon
what
your
paper
problem
joe
answer
was
to
take
from
the
valise
several
hundreds
of
the
circus
tickets
they
were
the
kind
sold
for
fifty
cents
or
perhaps
more
in
these
days
of
the
war
tax
they
entitle
the
holder
to
a
seat
on
what
at
a
baseball
game
would
be
called
the
bleachers
in
other
words
they
were
not
coupons
however
these
tickets
were
not
the
blue
or
red
pieces
of
stiff
pasteboard
bearing
the
name
of
the
circus
and
the
words
admit
one
which
were
formerly
sold
at
the
gilded
wagon
these
were
handed
in
at
the
main
entrance
and
the
tickets
were
used
over
and
over
again
sometimes
the
blue
ones
sold
for
fifty
cents
and
a
kind
selling
for
cents
entitled
the
purchaser
to
a
seat
with
a
folding
back
to
it
though
it
was
not
reserved
but
joe
had
instituted
some
changes
when
he
became
one
of
the
circus
proprietors
and
one
was
in
the
matter
of
the
general
admission
tickets
he
had
them
printed
on
a
thin
but
tough
quality
of
paper
and
each
ticket
was
numbered
in
this
way
it
needed
but
a
glance
at
the
last
ticket
in
the
rack
and
a
look
at
the
memorandum
of
the
last
number
previously
sold
at
the
former
performance
to
tell
exactly
how
many
general
admissions
had
been
disposed
of
these
numbered
tickets
were
not
used
over
again
but
were
destroyed
after
the
day
accounts
had
been
made
up
at
first
joe
and
some
others
of
the
officials
had
had
an
idea
that
the
man
who
was
charged
with
the
work
of
destroying
the
tickets
instead
of
doing
so
had
kept
some
out
and
sold
them
at
a
reduced
price
but
an
investigation
proved
that
this
was
not
the
case
some
one
is
ringing
in
extra
tickets
on
us
stated
joe
to
the
chemist
we
want
to
find
out
who
it
is
and
how
the
trick
is
worked
so
far
we
have
been
able
to
find
this
out
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
do
know
whether
there
are
bogus
tickets
in
our
boxes
or
not
we
have
been
able
to
detect
two
kinds
they
all
seem
the
same
some
numbers
must
be
duplicated
said
waldon
as
he
picked
up
a
handful
of
the
slips
joe
had
brought
that
very
obvious
the
numbers
must
be
duplicated
in
some
instances
yes
we
have
discovered
that
returned
joe
but
the
queer
part
is
taking
even
two
tickets
with
the
same
number
we
do
know
which
was
sold
at
our
ticket
wagon
and
which
is
the
bogus
one
here
a
case
in
point
he
picked
up
two
of
the
coupons
as
far
as
eye
or
touch
could
tell
they
were
identical
and
they
bore
the
same
red
number
one
up
in
the
hundred
thousands
now
continued
joe
can
you
tell
which
of
these
two
is
the
official
circus
ticket
and
which
is
the
bogus
one
the
chemist
thought
for
a
moment
have
you
a
ticket
say
one
issued
some
time
ago
which
you
are
positive
is
genuine
he
asked
i
ready
for
you
there
answered
joe
here
a
coupon
that
happened
to
escape
destruction
it
was
one
sold
several
weeks
ago
at
our
ticket
wagon
before
we
noticed
this
trouble
i
bought
the
ticket
myself
so
i
know
i
happened
to
be
passing
the
wagon
and
a
boy
was
trying
to
reach
up
to
buy
a
fifty
cent
seat
he
was
quite
tall
enough
so
i
reached
for
him
then
when
i
looked
at
him
i
saw
that
fifty
cents
meant
a
lot
to
him
i
gave
him
back
his
half
dollar
out
of
my
own
pocket
and
passed
him
in
to
a
reserved
seat
but
i
forgot
to
turn
the
ticket
in
to
the
wagon
and
it
been
in
my
pocket
ever
since
now
i
glad
i
saved
it
for
it
will
serve
as
a
tester
yes
admitted
the
chemist
it
will
it
a
good
thing
you
have
this
but
strong
this
is
going
to
take
some
time
i
have
to
compare
all
these
tickets
with
the
admittedly
genuine
one
and
i
have
to
make
some
intricate
tests
well
i
hoped
you
might
be
able
to
tell
me
right
off
the
reel
which
of
these
coupons
were
good
and
which
bad
said
joe
but
i
can
appreciate
that
it
is
easy
we
certainly
have
been
puzzled
so
i
leave
them
with
you
and
you
can
write
to
me
when
you
have
any
results
i
leave
you
a
list
of
the
towns
where
we
be
showing
for
the
next
two
weeks
and
now
suppose
we
get
at
the
business
all
right
was
the
reply
of
the
chemist
but
with
the
understanding
that
you
do
all
the
eating
i
have
any
appetite
that
way
myself
they
both
laughed
and
then
for
some
hours
joe
strong
was
closeted
with
the
chemist
when
joe
emerged
from
the
office
of
waldon
there
was
a
look
of
satisfaction
on
the
face
of
the
young
magician
i
think
i
can
make
quite
an
act
after
what
you
told
me
he
said
as
soon
as
i
get
it
perfected
i
send
you
word
and
you
can
come
to
see
me
i
will
if
you
are
too
far
away
promised
the
chemist
that
night
following
the
closing
of
the
performance
joe
invited
helen
jim
tracy
and
a
few
of
his
more
intimate
friends
and
associates
into
his
private
dressing
tent
i
have
the
nucleus
of
a
new
act
he
said
when
they
were
seated
in
chairs
before
a
small
table
on
which
were
several
pieces
of
apparatus
just
give
me
your
opinion
of
this
joe
lighted
a
candle
picked
up
on
a
fork
what
seemed
to
be
a
piece
of
bread
and
touched
it
to
the
candle
flame
in
an
instant
the
object
that
was
on
the
fork
burst
into
a
blaze
and
before
the
eyes
of
his
friends
joe
calmly
put
the
flaming
portion
into
his
mouth
he
closed
his
lips
seemed
to
be
chewing
something
opened
his
mouth
and
showed
it
empty
a
little
light
lunch
he
remarked
but
his
smile
faded
as
helen
screamed
in
horror
chapter
ix
the
chemist
letter
oh
joe
you
surely
burn
yourself
exclaimed
the
startled
bareback
rider
did
you
get
burned
questioned
watson
some
trick
declared
the
snake
charmer
for
the
moment
there
was
some
excitement
for
this
was
a
new
act
for
the
circus
people
helen
soon
recovered
her
customary
composure
and
then
she
explained
the
cause
of
her
excitement
and
the
startled
cry
she
had
given
she
had
of
course
expected
some
trick
with
fire
when
joe
had
summoned
her
and
the
others
to
his
own
private
part
of
the
dressing
tents
but
she
had
not
expected
to
see
him
actually
put
the
blazing
material
in
his
mouth
i
thought
there
was
some
performance
about
it
she
said
i
had
an
idea
that
you
only
pretended
to
put
the
blazing
stuff
in
your
mouth
joe
and
when
i
saw
it
i
was
afraid
you
breathe
in
the
flames
and
and
she
did
not
need
to
go
on
they
all
understood
what
she
meant
for
every
one
in
the
circus
knew
that
helen
and
joe
were
engaged
i
once
saw
a
little
boy
burned
at
a
bonfire
at
which
he
was
playing
went
on
helen
he
died
since
then
the
sight
of
fire
near
a
human
being
has
always
a
bad
effect
on
me
but
i
suppose
i
can
get
over
it
if
i
know
there
is
no
danger
she
said
with
a
slight
smile
at
joe
well
i
can
assure
you
there
is
the
slightest
danger
he
declared
if
there
was
i
should
be
the
first
to
give
it
up
i
am
as
fond
of
living
as
any
one
you
do
show
it
young
man
in
some
of
the
tricks
you
do
commented
watson
with
the
freedom
befitting
a
circus
mother
and
the
privilege
of
an
old
friend
you
must
remember
that
you
do
live
only
for
yourself
and
she
looked
significantly
at
helen
oh
i
be
careful
promised
joe
and
now
i
do
the
trick
again
for
you
and
let
you
see
that
it
absolutely
harmless
any
of
you
could
do
it
if
you
knew
how
excuse
me
exclaimed
jim
tracy
not
for
mine
however
they
all
watched
joe
eagerly
and
interestedly
even
helen
he
did
not
seem
to
make
any
unusual
preparations
he
merely
took
a
drink
of
what
seemed
to
be
water
then
he
ignited
something
in
the
flame
of
the
candle
and
placed
the
burning
stuff
in
his
mouth
seeming
to
chew
it
with
gusto
oh
exclaimed
helen
but
beyond
that
and
a
momentary
placing
of
one
hand
over
her
heart
she
did
not
give
way
to
emotion
then
as
joe
did
the
trick
again
helen
forced
herself
to
watch
him
closely
as
he
had
said
he
took
no
harm
from
the
act
tell
us
how
you
do
it
begged
bill
watson
when
i
get
over
being
funny
or
getting
audiences
to
think
i
am
i
may
want
to
live
on
something
hot
how
do
you
work
it
well
said
joe
if
it
all
the
same
to
you
i
rather
not
tell
it
is
that
i
afraid
of
any
of
my
friends
giving
the
trick
away
and
so
spoiling
the
mystery
of
it
for
the
crowds
it
just
as
it
was
in
my
box
act
if
any
of
you
are
asked
how
i
do
this
fire
trick
you
can
truly
say
you
do
know
for
none
of
you
will
know
by
my
telling
not
even
helen
though
she
is
in
on
the
box
secret
i
only
say
that
i
protect
my
face
and
mouth
as
well
as
hands
in
a
certain
way
and
that
i
do
actually
put
the
blazing
material
into
my
mouth
i
am
not
burned
so
if
any
one
asks
you
about
the
act
you
may
tell
them
that
much
with
absolute
truth
now
the
question
is
how
is
it
going
to
go
with
the
audiences
we
need
something
or
at
least
i
do
to
create
a
sensation
will
this
answer
i
should
say
so
exclaimed
jim
tracy
that
ought
to
go
big
when
dressed
up
oh
this
is
only
the
ground
work
said
joe
i
going
to
elaborate
this
fire
act
and
make
it
the
sensation
of
the
season
i
only
begun
on
it
i
got
from
a
chemist
the
materials
i
want
with
which
to
protect
myself
and
i
have
shown
to
my
own
and
your
satisfaction
that
i
can
eat
fire
without
getting
harmed
so
far
all
is
well
now
i
going
to
work
the
act
up
into
something
really
worth
while
but
you
still
be
careful
wo
you
joe
asked
helen
indeed
i
will
he
assured
her
do
the
trick
once
more
joe
suggested
bill
watson
i
coming
as
close
as
you
let
me
and
i
want
to
criticize
it
from
the
standpoint
of
a
man
in
the
audience
that
what
i
after
said
joe
if
there
are
any
flaws
in
the
act
now
is
the
time
to
find
it
out
once
more
he
set
the
material
ablaze
and
put
it
into
his
mouth
bill
watson
watched
closely
and
at
the
end
the
old
clown
shook
his
head
i
saw
you
actually
put
the
fire
in
your
mouth
he
testified
no
one
can
do
more
than
that
it
takes
nerve
of
course
no
one
can
actually
swallow
fire
and
live
the
slightest
breath
of
flame
on
the
lungs
or
on
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
throat
and
passages
is
fatal
so
when
the
terms
or
are
used
it
will
be
in
the
sense
of
its
being
a
theatrical
act
there
is
a
trick
about
it
and
the
trick
is
this
in
the
first
place
the
flame
itself
is
produced
by
blazing
alcohol
this
produces
a
blaze
and
a
hot
one
too
but
there
is
no
smoke
in
other
words
the
combustion
is
almost
perfect
there
being
no
residue
of
carbon
to
remain
hot
after
the
actual
flame
is
extinguished
and
now
as
to
the
actual
putting
into
one
mouth
something
that
is
blazing
hot
it
all
depends
on
a
very
simple
principle
if
the
hand
be
thoroughly
wet
in
water
it
may
be
safely
thrust
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
into
a
flaming
gas
jet
but
mark
this
for
the
of
a
second
the
water
forms
a
protecting
film
for
the
skin
and
before
it
is
evaporated
the
hand
must
be
taken
out
of
danger
in
other
words
there
is
needed
an
appreciable
time
for
the
fire
to
beat
the
skin
to
the
burning
point
this
immunity
from
burns
to
which
the
professional
owe
their
success
comes
from
this
film
of
moisture
on
their
skin
they
do
not
always
use
water
in
fact
this
is
only
serviceable
for
a
momentary
contact
with
flame
and
at
that
on
the
hands
or
face
in
case
a
longer
contact
is
desired
a
chemical
liquid
is
used
it
is
about
the
contact
of
flame
with
the
tender
mucous
membrane
surfaces
of
the
mouth
and
throat
that
joe
as
a
was
most
concerned
in
the
first
place
there
is
a
constant
film
of
the
secretion
called
saliva
always
flowing
in
the
mouth
it
comes
from
glands
in
the
throat
and
mouth
and
is
very
necessary
to
good
digestion
now
for
a
very
brief
period
this
saliva
which
is
just
the
same
as
a
film
of
water
on
the
hand
resists
the
fire
but
professional
do
not
depend
on
saliva
alone
they
use
a
chemical
solution
and
this
is
what
joe
did
when
he
drank
something
from
a
glass
what
that
chemical
solution
was
joe
kept
as
a
closely
guarded
professional
secret
he
feared
too
that
some
boy
might
make
it
rinse
his
mouth
out
with
it
and
then
getting
an
audience
of
his
chums
together
might
try
to
eat
some
blazing
coals
he
might
and
very
likely
would
be
severely
burned
and
his
parents
or
those
in
charge
of
him
would
blame
joe
for
allowing
such
dangerous
information
to
leak
out
so
though
he
guarded
all
his
secrets
of
magic
he
was
particularly
careful
to
keep
this
one
to
himself
but
joe
protected
his
mouth
and
throat
with
a
liquid
the
formula
for
which
was
given
him
by
the
chemist
to
whom
he
submitted
the
circus
tickets
the
success
of
joe
and
others
of
his
kind
depends
also
in
this
on
a
well
known
natural
law
it
is
that
there
can
be
no
combustion
in
the
ordinary
sense
where
there
is
no
oxygen
as
a
candle
will
surely
go
out
if
enclosed
in
an
receptacle
that
is
it
will
go
out
as
soon
as
it
has
burned
up
all
the
oxygen
just
so
surely
will
flame
of
any
kind
go
out
when
a
person
closes
his
mouth
on
it
and
as
there
is
scarcely
any
air
in
the
closed
mouth
all
of
it
going
down
the
bronchial
tubes
into
the
lungs
it
follows
that
the
flame
dies
out
almost
instantly
that
fact
being
considered
and
the
mouth
and
throat
having
been
previously
treated
with
the
secret
chemical
there
is
really
not
so
much
danger
as
appears
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
person
inadvertently
swallowing
hot
tea
or
coffee
will
burn
or
scald
his
mouth
or
tongue
much
more
painfully
than
will
a
professional
most
people
know
how
painful
a
burned
tongue
is
joe
told
something
of
the
history
of
champions
to
his
audience
of
friends
for
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
reading
up
on
the
subject
and
was
well
informed
then
he
announced
that
the
private
rehearsal
was
over
but
i
going
to
work
this
up
into
something
that
will
cause
a
sensation
he
said
and
he
made
good
his
promise
it
was
about
a
week
after
this
and
the
circus
had
been
traveling
about
playing
to
good
business
when
joe
received
a
letter
in
the
upper
corner
was
the
imprint
of
herbert
waldon
chemist
i
hope
he
has
some
news
about
the
circus
tickets
exclaimed
joe
for
the
show
had
been
losing
money
steadily
by
means
of
the
bogus
coupons
not
as
much
as
at
first
but
enough
to
make
it
necessary
to
discover
the
fraud
and
so
far
moyne
had
not
been
successful
perhaps
this
explains
the
mystery
mused
joe
as
he
opened
the
letter
chapter
x
the
pet
cat
the
typewritten
sheet
of
the
letter
from
waldon
enclosed
two
of
the
engraved
circus
coupons
they
fluttered
to
the
floor
of
joe
private
tent
as
he
tore
open
the
envelope
well
either
he
has
discovered
something
or
he
has
sent
them
back
and
given
up
mused
the
young
magician
let
see
what
he
says
joe
quickly
took
in
the
contents
of
the
letter
in
effect
it
stated
that
waldon
had
discovered
which
were
the
bogus
and
which
were
the
real
circus
tickets
he
first
gave
an
explanation
of
the
chemical
tests
he
used
joe
read
this
hastily
but
carefully
then
passed
to
the
conclusions
arrived
at
by
the
expert
who
was
an
authority
on
various
kinds
of
paper
as
well
as
chemicals
the
ticket
i
have
marked
no
is
a
genuine
coupon
issued
by
your
circus
corporation
said
waldon
in
his
letter
the
slip
marked
by
me
as
no
is
a
counterfeit
you
will
observe
that
they
both
bear
the
red
ink
serial
number
if
you
were
a
paper
expert
you
would
observe
that
the
paper
used
in
the
two
tickets
is
different
there
is
not
a
very
great
difference
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
both
the
genuine
and
the
counterfeit
tickets
were
made
on
paper
from
the
same
mill
but
of
a
different
that
is
it
was
made
at
a
different
time
the
printer
who
manufactured
your
tickets
bought
his
paper
from
a
certain
mill
making
a
specialty
of
this
particular
kind
then
some
one
who
must
know
something
of
your
financial
and
business
interests
had
the
bogus
tickets
made
and
on
the
same
kind
of
paper
but
there
is
a
slight
difference
which
i
was
able
to
detect
by
means
of
chemical
reactions
the
coloring
matter
used
varied
slightly
though
the
texture
of
the
two
kinds
of
paper
is
almost
exactly
similar
now
having
settled
that
point
the
solution
of
the
remaining
equations
of
the
problem
rests
with
you
i
can
not
tell
who
had
the
bogus
tickets
printed
you
will
have
to
go
to
the
mill
making
the
paper
and
find
out
to
whom
they
sold
this
kind
in
that
way
you
will
learn
the
names
of
all
printers
using
it
and
by
a
process
of
elimination
you
will
get
at
the
one
who
printed
the
counterfeits
this
printer
may
be
an
innocent
party
or
he
may
be
guilty
that
is
for
you
and
the
detectives
to
determine
i
hope
i
have
started
you
on
the
right
track
i
shall
be
interested
to
hear
my
dear
strong
how
you
make
out
in
your
act
i
tell
him
as
soon
as
i
try
it
on
a
real
audience
said
joe
with
a
smile
as
he
folded
the
letter
and
so
counterfeit
tickets
have
been
rung
in
on
us
well
i
suspected
that
since
our
own
men
were
thoroughly
to
be
trusted
now
to
get
at
the
guilty
ones
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
i
could
name
one
of
the
men
involved
but
i
call
a
meeting
and
lay
this
before
the
directors
the
sampson
brothers
show
was
incorporated
and
was
run
strictly
on
business
lines
there
was
a
board
of
directors
who
looked
after
all
business
matters
and
joe
was
soon
in
consultation
with
them
laying
before
them
waldon
letter
and
the
two
marked
tickets
it
would
take
an
expert
to
tell
them
apart
said
moyne
as
he
examined
the
coupons
closely
well
what
are
we
to
do
in
the
first
place
declared
joe
we
must
change
our
form
of
general
admission
tickets
at
once
that
will
stop
the
fraud
graft
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
then
we
must
do
as
waldon
says
look
for
the
guilty
parties
we
have
to
hire
some
detectives
i
think
this
plan
was
voted
a
good
one
and
steps
were
at
once
taken
to
change
the
form
and
style
of
the
general
admission
tickets
joe
also
wired
for
a
man
from
a
well
known
detective
agency
to
meet
the
show
at
the
next
town
then
the
printing
shop
which
made
the
circus
tickets
was
communicated
with
that
was
all
that
could
be
done
at
present
and
joe
gave
his
attention
to
perfecting
his
new
act
he
did
not
give
up
his
mystery
box
trick
and
he
still
presented
the
vanishing
lady
illusion
helen
assisting
in
both
of
these
joe
also
did
the
big
swing
which
always
caused
a
thrill
on
account
of
the
danger
involved
careful
watch
was
kept
over
the
trapeze
and
other
apparatus
so
that
no
more
dangerous
tampering
could
he
attempted
and
joe
always
looked
over
everything
with
sharp
eyes
before
trusting
himself
high
in
the
air
some
one
evidently
has
a
grudge
against
me
as
well
as
against
the
circus
in
general
he
said
to
jim
tracy
maybe
it
the
same
person
suggested
the
ringmaster
perhaps
well
as
soon
as
we
get
some
word
from
the
detectives
we
can
start
on
the
trail
the
circus
had
arrived
at
a
large
city
where
it
was
to
show
three
days
and
nights
and
preparations
were
made
for
big
crowds
as
the
city
was
the
center
of
a
large
number
of
industries
where
many
thousands
of
men
were
employed
at
good
wages
we
play
to
room
only
at
every
performance
said
moyne
rubbing
his
hands
with
glee
as
he
thought
of
the
dollars
that
would
be
taken
in
and
i
glad
we
discovered
the
bogus
tickets
in
time
we
be
out
a
lot
of
money
if
the
counterfeits
were
to
be
used
here
yes
agreed
joe
but
we
are
out
of
the
woods
yet
the
same
man
who
imitated
the
light
green
tickets
may
have
the
bright
blue
ones
which
we
now
use
for
general
admission
duplicated
and
sell
them
we
have
to
take
that
chance
said
the
treasurer
but
i
instruct
the
ticket
takers
to
be
unusually
careful
that
was
all
that
could
be
done
the
detective
had
reported
that
he
was
making
an
examination
starting
at
the
paper
mill
and
was
endeavoring
to
learn
where
the
bogus
tickets
had
been
made
the
circus
parade
had
been
held
and
witnessed
by
enthusiastic
crowds
lining
the
streets
then
was
every
prospect
of
big
business
and
it
was
borne
out
joe
wished
he
had
prepared
his
fire
act
earlier
but
it
could
not
be
helped
i
have
it
ready
for
though
he
said
to
jim
tracy
at
the
conclusion
of
the
first
afternoon
in
the
big
city
where
they
were
to
stay
three
days
then
i
going
to
have
it
advertised
said
the
ringmaster
who
also
sometimes
acted
as
assistant
general
manager
we
bill
it
big
sure
of
yourself
are
you
oh
yes
answered
joe
with
a
laugh
i
give
their
money
worth
all
right
but
it
wo
be
the
big
sensation
i
planning
for
later
on
that
will
take
time
well
as
long
as
it
a
fire
act
it
will
be
new
and
novel
and
it
will
draw
declared
jim
tracy
it
was
later
in
the
afternoon
when
the
circus
performance
was
over
that
joe
and
helen
strolled
downtown
as
was
their
custom
some
convention
was
being
held
in
the
city
and
across
one
of
the
principal
streets
was
stretched
a
big
banner
of
the
kind
used
in
political
campaigns
it
was
hung
from
a
heavy
slack
wire
from
the
brick
walls
of
two
opposite
buildings
and
the
banner
attracted
considerable
attention
because
of
a
novel
picture
on
it
joe
and
helen
were
standing
in
the
street
looking
up
at
the
swaying
creation
of
canvas
and
netting
when
a
woman
cry
came
to
their
ears
look
look
the
cat
the
cat
is
walking
the
wire
she
exclaimed
joe
and
helen
turned
first
to
see
who
it
was
that
had
cried
out
it
was
a
woman
in
the
street
and
with
her
parasol
she
pointed
upward
there
surely
enough
half
way
out
on
the
thick
slack
wire
and
high
above
the
middle
of
the
street
was
a
large
white
cat
it
was
walking
the
wire
as
one
pet
might
walk
the
back
fence
but
this
cat
seemed
to
have
lost
its
nerve
it
had
got
half
way
across
but
was
afraid
to
go
farther
and
could
not
turn
around
and
go
back
as
joe
and
helen
looked
a
woman
appeared
at
the
window
of
one
of
the
buildings
from
the
front
walls
of
which
the
banner
was
suspended
and
pointing
at
the
cat
cried
a
hundred
dollars
to
whoever
saves
my
cat
a
hundred
dollars
reward
chapter
xi
the
rescue
the
tumult
which
had
arisen
in
the
street
beneath
the
banner
when
the
crowd
caught
sight
of
the
cat
was
hushed
for
a
moment
after
the
frantic
cry
before
that
there
had
been
some
laughter
and
not
a
few
and
exaggerated
miaows
from
boys
in
the
street
but
now
every
one
even
the
mischievous
urchins
seemed
to
sense
that
something
unusual
was
about
to
take
place
come
back
peter
come
back
cried
the
woman
stretching
out
her
arms
to
the
cat
from
the
window
out
of
which
she
leaned
come
back
to
me
the
white
cat
on
the
wire
heard
the
voice
of
the
woman
and
seemed
to
want
to
return
to
its
mistress
but
either
the
cat
was
not
an
adept
at
turning
on
such
a
narrow
support
or
it
was
afraid
to
try
and
likewise
it
was
afraid
to
go
forward
there
it
stood
about
in
the
middle
of
the
wire
high
above
the
street
and
it
clung
to
its
perch
by
its
claws
the
banner
was
hung
from
the
cross
wire
by
means
of
several
loops
of
rope
and
it
was
in
some
of
these
loops
that
the
cat
had
stuck
its
claws
and
so
hung
on
as
the
cat
remained
there
suspended
the
crowd
in
the
street
below
increased
in
size
but
from
the
time
the
woman
had
so
frantically
called
there
had
been
no
more
of
the
cries
from
the
crowd
that
might
be
expected
to
frighten
the
animal
will
some
one
get
my
cat
cried
the
woman
in
a
shrill
voice
which
could
easily
be
heard
by
joe
helen
and
nearly
every
one
else
give
one
hundred
dollars
in
cash
to
whoever
saves
him
she
went
on
come
back
peter
come
back
she
appealed
there
was
a
thoughtless
laugh
from
some
one
at
the
woman
anxiety
and
some
one
cried
there
lots
of
cats
let
peter
go
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
ought
to
get
after
whoever
that
was
said
helen
indignantly
and
there
was
an
approving
murmur
from
some
of
those
near
her
does
any
one
know
that
lady
asked
joe
pointing
at
the
figure
in
the
window
a
pathetic
figure
it
was
too
of
an
old
woman
clad
in
black
as
though
she
had
lost
all
her
friends
yes
she
a
queer
character
said
some
one
who
seemed
to
know
lives
up
there
all
alone
in
the
old
house
that
except
for
the
upper
part
where
she
is
now
has
been
turned
into
offices
she
rich
they
say
owns
that
building
and
a
lot
of
others
on
this
street
but
she
lives
all
alone
in
a
few
rooms
and
has
a
lot
of
pet
cats
i
guess
that
one
which
got
away
it
got
away
all
right
said
another
man
and
i
do
believe
ever
get
it
back
the
cat
scared
to
death
why
does
it
jump
asked
some
one
i
heard
that
cats
always
land
on
their
feet
no
matter
how
far
they
fall
a
fall
from
there
would
kill
any
cat
said
joe
as
he
handed
helen
a
small
package
he
had
been
carrying
a
purchase
he
had
made
at
one
of
the
stores
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
sensing
that
joe
strong
had
some
object
in
mind
i
going
to
get
that
cat
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
ca
bear
to
see
it
harmed
and
it
ca
cling
there
much
longer
night
coming
on
too
and
if
it
is
rescued
soon
it
wo
be
until
morning
i
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
pet
suffer
i
going
to
get
that
cat
oh
mister
you
ca
cried
a
small
girl
who
was
standing
near
by
and
overheard
this
remark
i
should
say
not
exclaimed
the
man
who
had
given
a
little
personal
sketch
of
the
woman
in
black
the
longest
ladder
in
the
fire
department
wo
reach
up
to
that
wire
and
they
ca
use
extension
ones
or
scaling
ones
as
they
could
on
a
building
you
ca
get
that
cat
sir
though
i
wish
some
one
could
i
do
like
to
see
dumb
brutes
suffer
but
you
ca
get
it
perhaps
i
can
said
joe
modestly
he
started
toward
the
street
entrance
of
the
old
building
from
the
upper
window
of
which
leaned
the
pathetic
figure
of
the
woman
calling
to
her
cat
out
on
the
swaying
wire
oh
joe
helen
began
are
you
really
going
to
and
then
she
stopped
i
am
he
answered
for
he
knew
she
understood
wait
here
for
me
i
wo
be
long
only
a
few
in
the
crowd
had
heard
what
joe
said
or
understood
his
intentions
as
he
made
his
way
through
the
press
of
people
the
woman
at
the
window
was
unaware
of
the
fact
that
some
one
had
heard
her
and
was
about
to
heed
her
appeal
a
hundred
dollars
to
whoever
saves
my
cat
she
cried
again
this
time
no
one
laughed
joe
strong
acrobat
athlete
magician
and
possessed
of
many
other
muscular
accomplishments
started
up
the
stairs
the
lower
part
of
the
office
building
was
deserted
at
this
hour
but
he
made
his
way
to
the
place
where
he
judged
the
woman
lived
alone
he
was
confirmed
in
this
belief
by
hearing
from
behind
a
closed
door
the
barking
and
whining
of
dogs
she
must
keep
a
regular
menagerie
mused
joe
probably
these
are
all
the
friends
she
has
poor
old
lady
he
knocked
on
a
door
that
seemed
to
be
the
entrance
to
the
living
apartments
there
was
a
cessation
of
the
barking
and
whining
and
a
moment
later
a
querulous
voice
asked
who
is
there
what
do
you
want
is
that
your
cat
out
on
the
wire
asked
joe
yes
oh
yes
that
peter
my
favorite
cat
oh
have
you
saved
him
have
you
got
him
down
no
you
ca
have
he
out
on
that
wire
yet
she
cried
and
then
she
opened
the
door
joe
was
confronted
by
the
same
woman
he
had
observed
leaning
from
the
window
her
face
was
pale
and
she
was
quite
elderly
but
there
was
a
kind
and
pathetic
look
about
her
eyes
once
she
must
have
been
beautiful
joe
had
no
time
to
speculate
on
what
might
have
been
the
romantic
history
of
the
woman
she
looked
eagerly
at
him
what
do
you
want
she
demanded
i
never
see
any
one
i
live
here
alone
i
must
beg
you
to
excuse
me
i
have
to
see
if
some
one
will
not
save
my
cat
that
is
just
what
i
came
up
for
said
joe
smiling
i
am
a
lover
of
animals
myself
i
like
to
save
your
pet
oh
if
you
will
i
pay
you
the
hundred
dollars
cried
the
woman
i
have
it
she
went
on
eagerly
it
in
here
and
she
motioned
to
the
rooms
they
were
tastefully
but
not
lavishly
furnished
we
talk
about
that
later
said
joe
with
a
smile
the
point
is
let
me
get
the
cat
first
but
you
ca
get
him
from
here
from
these
rooms
the
woman
in
black
exclaimed
he
out
on
the
wire
you
have
to
climb
up
in
some
way
oh
i
do
know
how
you
can
do
it
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
she
clasped
her
hands
imploringly
i
ca
get
your
cat
from
the
street
said
joe
that
why
i
came
up
here
i
must
walk
out
on
the
wire
from
your
window
have
you
a
pair
of
slippers
the
older
and
softer
the
better
slippers
with
thin
worn
soles
why
yes
i
have
but
you
you
ca
walk
out
on
the
wire
it
is
too
small
almost
for
my
cat
you
ca
do
it
it
is
impossible
oh
no
answered
joe
gently
it
is
impossible
i
have
done
it
before
if
you
let
me
get
to
a
window
near
which
the
wire
is
stretched
and
if
you
will
let
me
take
a
pair
of
old
slippers
come
in
interrupted
the
eccentric
old
woman
opening
wide
the
door
i
do
in
the
least
know
what
you
intend
to
do
but
something
seems
to
tell
me
i
can
trust
you
and
if
only
you
can
save
peter
i
try
said
joe
simply
the
woman
began
to
search
frantically
in
a
closet
throwing
out
shoes
dresses
and
other
feminine
wearing
apparel
as
she
delved
among
the
things
a
shout
arose
from
the
street
the
noise
of
the
voices
floating
in
through
the
open
window
joe
looked
out
oh
has
peter
fallen
cried
the
woman
that
too
had
been
joe
thought
no
he
answered
as
he
took
an
observation
your
cat
has
only
changed
his
position
a
little
i
suppose
the
crowd
thought
it
was
going
to
fall
but
it
all
right
i
soon
have
it
back
to
you
is
it
a
vicious
cat
oh
no
indeed
he
as
gentle
as
can
be
but
perhaps
he
might
be
so
scared
now
that
he
would
know
what
he
was
doing
i
see
what
you
mean
here
i
give
you
an
old
pair
of
gloves
for
your
hands
that
what
i
want
said
joe
i
ca
afford
to
have
my
hands
scratched
as
i
do
some
legerdemain
tricks
but
i
need
some
slippers
more
than
i
need
gloves
here
is
a
pair
said
the
woman
they
mine
i
wear
large
ones
for
i
like
to
be
comfortable
they
fit
me
decided
joe
after
an
inspection
just
what
i
want
too
he
began
to
take
off
his
shoes
do
you
really
mean
you
are
going
to
walk
out
on
that
wire
and
get
my
cat
asked
the
woman
comprehending
his
intention
as
she
saw
joe
putting
on
the
slippers
and
drawing
on
the
old
gloves
she
had
given
him
they
were
a
man
size
and
he
judged
she
must
have
used
them
in
rough
work
about
the
house
i
going
out
on
the
wire
to
get
your
cat
he
said
oh
but
i
ought
not
to
let
you
you
may
fall
and
be
killed
when
i
said
i
give
a
hundred
dollars
to
whoever
would
save
peter
i
did
not
mean
that
any
one
should
risk
his
life
much
as
i
love
my
cat
i
allow
that
i
be
all
right
said
joe
easily
walking
wires
is
part
of
my
business
now
do
worry
and
please
do
scream
if
you
are
going
to
watch
me
she
looked
at
him
curiously
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
screaming
she
said
quietly
well
i
thought
it
best
to
mention
it
said
joe
he
was
now
ready
for
his
most
novel
form
of
walking
the
wire
he
moved
toward
the
window
from
which
the
woman
had
leaned
it
was
the
same
casement
whence
the
cat
had
started
on
its
perilous
journey
joe
felt
sure
of
himself
the
slippers
were
just
what
he
needed
with
soft
pliable
soles
worn
thin
they
were
the
best
substitute
he
could
have
found
for
his
circus
shoes
the
wire
from
which
the
banner
was
suspended
was
fast
to
an
set
in
the
brick
wall
of
the
building
a
little
below
the
sill
of
the
window
it
had
been
easy
for
the
cat
to
step
out
and
get
on
the
cable
joe
appeared
at
the
window
he
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
in
his
white
shirt
blue
tie
and
black
trousers
he
made
a
striking
figure
in
the
brilliant
sunset
light
instantly
the
crowd
in
the
street
saw
him
and
divined
his
intention
joe
doubted
not
that
helen
was
looking
up
at
him
it
was
an
easy
step
for
him
from
the
window
sill
to
the
wire
from
which
was
suspended
the
banner
he
knew
it
would
support
his
weight
in
addition
to
the
big
net
affair
the
size
of
the
cable
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
fastened
told
him
that
still
he
cautiously
tried
it
with
one
foot
before
trusting
all
his
weight
to
it
the
spring
of
the
wire
told
him
all
he
needed
to
know
pausing
a
moment
to
make
sure
of
himself
joe
strong
started
to
walk
across
the
wire
toward
the
clinging
cat
the
crowd
gave
one
roar
of
welcome
and
approval
and
then
became
hushed
this
was
what
joe
wanted
now
it
was
just
as
if
he
were
doing
the
act
in
the
circus
only
there
was
this
difference
there
was
no
safety
net
below
him
but
it
was
not
the
first
time
joe
had
taken
this
risk
true
beneath
him
were
the
hard
stones
of
the
street
but
a
fall
from
the
height
at
which
he
now
was
would
be
fatal
no
matter
what
the
character
of
ground
under
him
he
dismissed
all
such
thoughts
from
his
mind
slowly
and
with
the
caution
he
always
used
joe
started
on
his
journey
across
the
wire
the
cat
felt
his
coming
and
turned
its
head
as
it
crouched
down
and
looked
at
him
but
it
did
not
move
the
creature
was
literally
scared
stiff
foot
by
foot
joe
progressed
below
him
the
crowd
watched
breathlessly
joe
knew
helen
was
there
praying
for
him
though
he
could
not
see
her
in
the
window
stood
the
figure
in
black
a
silent
hopeful
but
much
worried
woman
she
kept
her
promise
not
to
scream
but
joe
realized
that
the
crucial
moment
was
yet
to
come
on
and
on
he
went
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
crouching
cat
if
only
the
animal
would
have
sense
enough
to
lie
still
and
not
make
a
fuss
when
he
picked
it
up
joe
felt
that
all
would
be
well
but
would
peter
behave
that
was
the
question
joe
was
now
almost
over
the
middle
of
the
street
far
below
him
was
the
crowd
a
sea
of
upturned
faces
reddened
by
the
reflected
rays
of
the
setting
sun
the
throng
was
silent
joe
was
glad
of
that
keep
still
now
peter
i
coming
for
you
said
joe
in
a
low
voice
that
right
peter
added
the
woman
be
a
good
cat
now
you
are
going
to
be
saved
keep
still
and
do
scratch
whether
the
cat
heard
and
understood
it
is
hard
to
say
but
it
uttered
a
pitiful
mew
inch
by
inch
foot
by
foot
joe
advanced
he
was
quite
sure
of
himself
now
he
felt
that
he
could
easily
have
walked
across
the
wire
from
building
to
building
with
the
street
chasm
below
him
and
even
could
have
made
the
return
trip
but
picking
up
the
cat
and
carrying
it
back
was
another
thing
it
would
have
been
easier
for
joe
to
have
carried
a
man
across
on
his
back
he
could
direct
the
motions
of
the
man
could
he
those
of
the
cat
still
he
was
going
to
try
on
and
on
he
went
the
woman
in
black
was
leaning
from
the
window
holding
out
her
arms
as
though
to
catch
joe
should
he
fall
but
he
did
not
think
of
falling
in
another
few
seconds
he
was
standing
right
over
the
cat
he
could
see
the
animal
claws
tensely
clinging
to
the
rope
strands
that
held
the
banner
now
came
ticklish
work
easy
peter
go
easy
now
said
joe
soothingly
he
slowly
and
carefully
stooped
down
it
was
a
trick
he
had
often
performed
in
the
circus
on
the
high
wire
but
never
under
circumstances
like
this
joe
hands
came
in
contact
with
the
fur
of
the
cat
back
he
gently
stroked
the
animal
murmuring
come
on
now
peter
let
go
loosen
your
claws
i
not
going
to
hurt
you
let
me
pick
you
up
again
it
is
hard
to
say
that
the
cat
knew
what
joe
was
saying
but
it
certainly
made
its
body
less
tense
the
claws
were
loosed
joe
straightened
up
holding
the
cat
in
his
arms
he
could
feel
its
heart
beating
like
some
overworked
motor
a
roar
arose
from
the
crowd
but
it
was
instantly
hushed
the
throng
seemed
to
realize
that
the
return
journey
was
infinitely
more
perilous
than
the
outward
one
had
been
joe
could
not
turn
he
must
walk
backward
to
the
window
carrying
the
cat
which
at
any
moment
might
become
wild
and
scramble
from
his
arms
upsetting
his
balance
yet
joe
strong
never
faltered
chapter
xii
the
fire
act
realizing
that
he
must
use
every
caution
joe
strong
had
two
things
to
think
of
one
was
himself
and
the
other
the
cat
he
could
not
carry
the
creature
in
his
arms
as
he
needed
to
extend
them
to
balance
himself
he
had
walked
short
distances
along
slack
wires
without
doing
this
but
in
those
cases
he
had
been
able
to
run
and
his
speed
made
up
for
the
lack
of
balancing
power
of
the
extended
arms
now
however
he
needed
to
observe
this
precaution
what
could
he
do
with
the
cat
in
that
moment
of
peril
a
boyhood
scene
arose
to
joe
mind
he
recalled
that
on
the
farm
where
he
had
lived
there
was
a
pet
cat
which
liked
to
crawl
up
his
back
and
curl
on
his
shoulders
stretching
out
completely
across
them
and
snuggling
against
the
back
of
his
head
if
i
can
get
this
cat
to
do
that
i
be
all
right
thought
joe
try
it
balancing
himself
he
changed
the
cat
position
and
put
it
up
on
his
shoulder
even
if
it
rested
on
only
one
it
would
leave
his
hands
free
and
he
could
extend
his
arms
and
balance
himself
but
peter
seemed
to
know
just
what
was
wanted
of
him
with
a
little
mew
the
animal
took
the
very
position
joe
wanted
it
to
extended
along
his
back
close
to
his
head
and
not
until
then
did
joe
begin
to
step
backward
breathlessly
the
crowd
watched
him
step
by
step
he
went
feeling
for
the
wire
on
which
he
placed
his
feet
and
each
step
made
him
more
confident
the
crowd
was
silently
watching
it
was
reserving
its
wild
applause
step
by
step
joe
walked
backward
until
he
heard
the
low
voice
of
the
woman
at
the
open
window
shall
i
take
peter
now
she
asked
can
you
reach
him
asked
joe
he
knew
he
was
close
to
the
building
yes
she
answered
then
do
said
joe
he
may
try
to
spring
off
when
he
sees
himself
so
close
to
you
take
him
i
stand
still
a
moment
he
felt
the
cat
stirring
the
next
instant
he
was
relieved
of
weight
and
then
with
a
quick
turning
motion
joe
himself
was
half
way
within
the
window
and
sitting
on
the
sill
he
had
walked
out
on
the
wire
stretched
a
hundred
feet
above
the
street
and
rescued
the
cat
the
pet
was
now
in
the
arms
of
the
woman
in
black
and
then
such
a
roar
as
went
up
in
the
crowd
men
thumped
one
another
on
the
back
and
then
shook
hands
wondering
at
their
foolishness
and
why
there
was
such
a
queer
lump
in
their
throats
oh
oh
gasped
the
woman
as
she
hugged
peter
to
her
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
not
in
all
my
life
it
may
be
foolish
to
care
so
much
for
a
cat
but
i
ca
help
it
it
is
all
that
i
could
have
borne
it
to
have
seen
him
fall
and
be
killed
he
all
right
now
after
he
gets
over
being
scared
said
joe
as
he
stroked
the
cat
in
the
arms
of
the
woman
in
black
and
now
will
you
let
me
know
to
whom
i
am
indebted
she
asked
please
come
in
and
i
pay
you
the
reward
well
i
come
in
and
put
on
my
shoes
said
joe
with
a
smile
i
did
need
the
gloves
he
added
peter
was
very
gentle
oh
he
a
good
cat
said
his
mistress
and
now
she
added
when
joe
had
resumed
his
shoes
and
coat
will
you
please
tell
me
your
name
and
how
you
learned
to
walk
wires
and
rescue
cats
i
never
rescued
cats
before
joe
returned
smiling
it
something
new
but
walking
wires
is
my
trade
or
one
of
i
with
the
circus
i
do
some
tricks
and
oh
are
you
the
man
who
gets
out
of
the
box
she
cried
i
have
read
about
that
trick
it
is
one
of
mine
said
joe
modestly
i
so
glad
to
know
you
exclaimed
the
woman
she
seemed
less
of
a
recluse
than
at
first
i
have
been
to
a
circus
for
years
not
since
i
was
a
child
she
continued
half
sadly
joe
thought
but
i
coming
she
exclaimed
i
have
the
janitor
look
after
my
cats
and
dogs
and
i
go
to
the
circus
i
want
to
see
you
act
it
will
bring
back
my
lost
youth
or
part
of
it
she
murmured
allow
me
to
make
sure
that
you
will
be
there
said
joe
here
is
a
reserved
ticket
i
will
look
for
you
and
now
let
me
give
you
the
reward
i
promised
begged
the
woman
as
joe
was
about
to
leave
i
have
the
money
here
in
cash
she
added
quickly
she
went
to
a
bureau
putting
peter
down
on
a
cushion
the
cat
observed
joe
intently
the
woman
came
back
with
a
roll
of
bills
no
really
i
could
take
it
protested
joe
i
did
save
your
cat
for
money
i
was
glad
enough
to
do
it
for
the
animal
sake
please
take
it
she
urged
i
i
am
well
off
even
if
i
live
here
she
said
hesitatingly
i
shall
feel
better
if
you
take
it
and
i
shall
feel
better
if
you
give
it
to
the
red
cross
said
joe
that
needs
it
to
help
the
stricken
more
than
i
do
i
make
pretty
good
money
myself
he
added
and
i
did
do
this
for
a
reward
but
i
promised
it
well
then
consider
that
i
took
it
and
you
in
my
name
may
pass
it
on
to
the
red
cross
said
joe
and
now
may
i
ask
your
name
the
woman
told
him
it
was
miss
susan
crawford
the
name
meant
nothing
to
joe
though
he
afterward
learned
she
was
a
member
of
an
old
wealthy
and
aristocratic
family
she
had
had
an
unfortunate
love
affair
and
her
family
having
all
died
she
made
for
herself
a
little
apartment
in
one
of
her
many
buildings
and
lived
there
with
her
pets
a
recluse
in
the
midst
of
a
big
city
it
was
a
pathetic
story
i
wish
you
would
let
me
reward
you
in
some
way
said
miss
crawford
wistfully
as
joe
left
you
did
so
much
and
you
get
nothing
out
of
it
oh
yes
i
do
returned
the
young
acrobat
i
get
a
lot
of
advertising
out
of
this
and
it
will
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
the
circus
and
joe
was
right
the
next
day
the
papers
all
carried
big
stories
of
his
feat
to
save
the
cat
that
had
ventured
out
over
the
street
and
was
afraid
to
go
back
bigger
crowds
than
ever
came
to
the
circus
as
she
had
promised
miss
crawford
was
at
the
evening
performance
and
joe
introduced
a
little
novelty
in
one
of
his
magic
stunts
producing
a
cat
instead
of
a
rabbit
from
a
man
pocket
as
he
held
it
up
he
looked
over
and
smiled
at
the
old
lady
in
black
for
he
had
given
her
a
seat
near
his
stage
she
smiled
back
joe
never
saw
her
again
she
was
found
dead
a
few
months
later
in
her
lonely
rooms
with
her
cats
and
dogs
around
her
but
joe
always
remembered
her
the
street
feat
was
the
talk
of
the
city
and
when
the
following
day
joe
announced
that
he
was
ready
to
put
on
his
fire
act
which
had
been
well
advertised
every
one
was
on
figurative
tiptoes
to
see
what
it
would
be
joe
had
made
all
his
preparations
and
he
had
taken
care
to
provide
against
danger
and
accidents
he
realized
the
risk
he
was
running
in
handling
fire
in
a
circus
tent
before
crowds
of
people
but
extinguishers
were
provided
and
one
of
the
force
of
the
circus
was
constantly
on
hand
after
the
preliminary
whistle
of
the
ringmaster
which
ended
the
other
acts
and
prepared
for
joe
new
one
the
young
magician
advanced
to
the
platform
and
gave
a
little
patter
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
in
introducing
my
new
act
i
wish
first
of
all
to
assure
you
that
there
is
no
danger
even
though
i
seem
to
be
in
the
midst
of
fire
do
not
be
alarmed
i
shall
be
safe
and
no
harm
will
come
to
you
joe
did
this
to
forestall
a
possible
panic
you
have
all
heard
of
the
ancient
salamanders
he
went
on
it
is
reputed
that
this
animal
was
able
to
live
in
the
midst
of
fire
as
to
the
truth
of
that
i
can
not
say
i
never
saw
a
salamander
that
i
know
of
but
that
fire
may
safely
be
handled
by
human
beings
and
not
at
the
risk
of
being
burned
i
am
about
to
demonstrate
to
you
i
shall
first
show
you
how
to
carry
fire
about
in
your
hands
so
that
if
you
run
short
of
matches
at
any
time
you
will
not
lack
means
of
igniting
the
gas
starting
your
kitchen
range
or
enjoying
your
smoke
while
the
stage
is
being
made
ready
for
my
main
act
i
will
show
you
how
to
carry
fire
in
your
hands
chapter
xiii
a
sensational
dive
striking
a
match
joe
ignited
two
candles
that
stood
on
a
little
table
at
one
side
of
his
stage
on
the
other
side
his
assistants
were
setting
up
the
apparatus
he
intended
to
use
in
his
more
elaborate
experiments
you
observe
that
the
trick
has
not
yet
begun
said
joe
with
a
laugh
as
he
blew
out
the
match
in
other
words
i
am
lighting
these
candles
in
the
ordinary
way
just
as
any
one
of
you
would
do
it
if
he
needed
to
in
a
moment
i
will
show
you
how
to
light
the
candles
in
case
one
is
accidentally
blown
out
and
you
have
no
match
allowing
both
candles
to
burn
up
well
with
clear
bright
flames
joe
suddenly
blew
out
one
now
he
said
i
will
show
you
how
to
carry
fire
in
your
hands
from
the
lighted
to
the
unlighted
candle
watch
me
closely
joe
cupped
his
hands
around
the
lighted
candle
seeming
to
take
the
flame
up
in
his
fingers
when
he
removed
his
hands
which
he
still
held
in
cup
or
globular
shape
the
second
candle
had
been
extinguished
both
were
now
out
you
will
notice
that
i
am
carrying
the
flame
in
my
hands
from
one
candle
to
the
other
said
joe
in
a
loud
voice
as
he
walked
across
the
stage
for
an
instant
he
spread
his
hands
cup
fashion
around
the
candle
he
had
first
blown
out
suddenly
he
withdrew
his
hands
holding
them
wide
apart
and
in
full
view
of
the
audience
and
lo
the
unlighted
candle
was
glowing
brightly
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
the
applause
broke
forth
joe
bowed
and
said
that
is
how
to
carry
fire
in
your
hands
but
please
do
any
of
you
try
it
unless
you
get
the
directions
from
me
tell
us
how
to
do
it
piped
up
a
small
boy
come
and
see
me
after
the
show
laughed
joe
and
while
on
this
subject
it
might
be
well
to
explain
how
joe
did
the
trick
it
is
very
simple
but
it
takes
practice
and
an
amateur
may
easily
be
fatally
burned
in
the
attempt
simple
as
it
is
joe
lighted
the
candles
in
the
usual
way
with
a
match
as
already
explained
there
was
no
trick
about
this
nor
about
blowing
out
one
but
immediately
after
that
the
trick
started
joe
placed
a
little
piece
of
waxed
paper
between
the
first
and
second
fingers
of
his
left
hand
as
soon
as
he
had
blown
out
the
first
candle
this
paper
was
a
slender
strip
and
could
not
be
seen
by
the
audience
when
he
cupped
his
hands
around
the
remaining
lighted
candle
joe
ignited
this
waxed
strip
taking
care
to
work
it
away
from
his
palms
and
fingers
it
burned
with
a
tiny
flame
and
with
scarcely
any
heat
in
the
middle
of
the
hollow
cup
formed
by
his
hands
as
soon
as
he
had
ignited
the
paper
joe
by
pressing
the
lower
edges
of
his
palms
against
the
blazing
wick
of
the
candle
extinguished
it
this
had
the
same
effect
as
though
he
had
pinched
out
the
flame
with
finger
and
thumb
as
many
country
persons
put
out
or
snuff
candles
for
candles
are
still
much
used
in
some
places
now
we
have
joe
with
a
little
blazing
taper
concealed
in
his
cupped
hands
advancing
to
the
candle
he
first
blew
out
he
placed
his
hands
around
this
lighted
the
wick
from
the
taper
which
he
at
once
crushed
between
his
fingers
and
the
trick
was
done
the
candle
was
lighted
the
remains
of
the
little
taper
were
concealed
between
joe
fingers
and
it
looked
as
though
he
had
really
carried
fire
in
his
hands
the
quickness
with
which
he
pinched
out
the
candle
flame
and
also
smothered
the
taper
after
he
had
used
it
prevented
him
from
being
burned
in
the
slightest
but
it
is
best
for
a
boy
unpracticed
and
without
the
dexterity
of
a
professional
prestidigitator
not
to
undertake
to
play
with
fire
joe
strong
believed
in
doing
his
tricks
and
acts
artistically
and
elaborately
he
had
watched
other
performers
dress
their
act
and
he
had
often
improved
on
what
even
stage
veterans
had
done
his
apprenticeship
had
been
a
stern
but
good
one
and
now
he
was
going
to
introduce
something
novel
in
his
tricks
but
he
was
also
going
to
add
to
that
he
had
read
considerable
of
late
about
the
tricks
of
the
old
magicians
and
had
delved
into
many
curious
old
books
now
he
was
going
to
give
his
audience
some
of
this
information
there
is
a
trick
in
everything
said
joe
as
he
faced
his
audience
in
readiness
for
the
act
if
i
told
you
that
i
actually
swallowed
blazing
fire
any
physician
would
know
that
i
was
not
telling
the
truth
i
do
not
really
eat
the
fire
i
only
seem
to
do
so
but
if
in
doing
so
i
can
deceive
you
into
thinking
i
do
and
you
are
thrilled
and
amused
you
get
your
money
worth
i
earn
mine
and
we
are
all
satisfied
so
do
be
alarmed
by
what
you
see
the
resistance
of
the
human
body
to
heat
is
greater
than
many
persons
suppose
said
joe
and
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
wet
heat
and
dry
heat
water
above
one
hundred
and
fifty
degrees
would
be
unbearable
it
would
really
burn
you
badly
water
as
you
know
boils
at
two
hundred
and
twelve
degrees
fahrenheit
but
before
this
point
is
reached
it
is
capable
of
ending
life
dry
heat
however
is
different
men
have
frequently
borne
without
permanent
discomfort
dry
heat
up
to
three
hundred
degrees
this
heat
is
often
reached
in
the
drying
rooms
of
oilcloth
and
oiled
silk
factories
now
the
fire
i
handle
is
dry
heat
i
would
no
more
think
of
pouring
boiling
water
over
my
hands
than
i
would
of
taking
poison
and
yet
i
will
show
you
that
i
can
thrust
my
hand
into
a
blazing
fire
and
suffer
no
harm
in
an
old
book
i
read
that
to
enable
one
to
thrust
one
hands
into
the
fire
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
anoint
them
with
a
mixture
of
quicksilver
camphor
and
spirits
of
wine
i
should
prefer
to
leave
that
mixture
alone
though
in
the
book
it
is
said
that
if
one
puts
that
mixture
on
his
hands
he
may
handle
boiling
lead
perhaps
some
ancient
magician
did
this
but
i
think
he
depended
more
on
water
than
on
anything
else
if
your
hands
are
wet
there
is
formed
on
them
a
film
of
moisture
which
for
a
moment
will
enable
you
to
withstand
high
degrees
of
dry
heat
in
another
old
book
i
read
that
if
one
prepared
himself
with
stortax
which
is
juice
from
a
certain
tree
growing
in
italy
he
could
enter
fire
bathe
in
fire
put
a
burning
coal
on
his
tongue
and
even
swallow
fire
now
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
into
all
my
secrets
you
shall
see
what
you
shall
see
concluded
joe
as
intimated
before
the
method
joe
strong
used
is
not
going
to
be
printed
here
you
have
been
given
some
genuine
ancient
formulae
safe
in
the
knowledge
that
some
of
the
ingredients
can
not
be
obtained
and
the
modern
substitutes
are
not
going
to
be
told
enough
to
say
that
joe
had
prepared
himself
the
young
magician
looked
to
see
that
all
was
in
readiness
perceiving
that
it
was
he
retired
for
a
moment
to
a
cabinet
set
up
on
the
stage
and
when
he
came
out
he
was
ready
for
his
tricks
joe
advanced
to
what
seemed
to
be
an
elaborate
candelabra
in
which
seven
tapers
were
set
he
stood
in
front
of
this
a
moment
and
then
he
announced
having
lived
on
a
fire
diet
so
long
i
have
a
bit
to
spare
i
will
light
these
candles
without
using
a
match
he
waved
his
hand
over
the
candelabra
sparks
were
seen
to
shoot
from
his
finger
tips
and
in
an
instant
the
seven
lights
were
glowing
that
was
an
electrical
trick
in
reality
the
candles
were
gas
jets
made
to
look
like
wax
tapers
and
joe
lighted
them
from
an
electric
current
produced
by
a
dry
battery
he
carried
on
his
person
he
then
proceeded
to
his
main
trick
he
picked
up
a
plate
it
seemed
to
contain
pieces
of
bread
joe
touched
the
edge
of
the
plate
to
a
flame
of
one
of
the
candles
in
an
instant
the
plate
was
ablaze
and
joe
calmly
began
putting
the
blazing
stuff
on
it
into
his
mouth
cube
after
cube
of
the
blazing
bread
he
lifted
up
on
a
fork
and
thrust
between
his
lips
and
he
seemed
to
enjoy
the
eating
of
it
the
audience
was
spellbound
every
one
eyes
were
on
joe
strong
doing
his
trick
the
plate
was
empty
joe
looked
about
as
though
for
something
else
hot
to
eat
he
caught
up
an
article
from
a
table
holding
it
to
the
flame
of
a
candle
it
was
at
once
ablaze
and
then
with
a
thrilling
cry
joe
strong
leaped
from
the
stage
his
two
hands
held
high
above
his
head
seeming
to
be
enveloped
in
a
mass
of
fire
and
with
this
fire
held
over
him
he
ran
toward
the
tank
in
which
benny
turton
did
his
human
fish
act
the
next
instant
joe
strong
apparently
ablaze
all
over
dived
into
the
tank
chapter
xiv
head
first
which
was
the
more
surprised
benny
turton
who
had
just
finished
his
fish
act
in
his
tank
the
spellbound
audience
or
jim
tracy
who
was
in
a
way
directing
joe
performance
it
would
be
hard
to
say
all
three
were
thrilled
by
the
unexpected
outcome
of
the
act
joe
strong
alone
seemed
perfectly
at
his
ease
and
it
might
be
mentioned
incidentally
perfectly
at
home
in
the
water
he
had
as
told
in
a
previous
volume
entitled
joe
strong
the
boy
fish
perfected
himself
in
this
sort
of
work
and
could
remain
submerged
for
an
unusually
long
time
of
course
the
fire
which
seemed
to
envelop
the
young
magician
was
instantly
put
out
when
he
leaped
into
the
tank
he
was
wearing
a
rather
fancy
suit
and
as
he
came
up
wet
and
bedraggled
jim
tracy
could
not
help
wondering
what
joe
meant
by
his
performance
joe
joe
was
that
part
of
the
act
or
an
accident
asked
jim
in
a
low
voice
as
he
ran
over
to
where
joe
was
now
climbing
out
of
the
tank
for
one
instant
joe
hesitated
the
audience
was
wildly
applauding
now
clearly
there
was
but
one
thought
in
their
minds
the
whole
thing
was
a
trick
joe
had
only
pretended
to
be
on
fire
and
had
taken
that
sensational
means
of
appearing
to
extinguish
the
blaze
but
the
ringmaster
noted
a
queer
look
on
his
friend
face
it
was
not
the
look
it
usually
wore
when
joe
had
completed
some
hazardous
or
sensational
trick
are
you
hurt
joe
burned
asked
jim
tracy
anxiously
no
was
the
answer
it
was
all
part
of
the
act
the
ringmaster
looked
satisfied
and
it
was
not
until
some
time
afterward
that
he
learned
what
a
narrow
escape
joe
had
had
this
will
be
part
of
the
stunt
at
every
show
said
joe
to
the
ringmaster
you
might
make
the
announcement
so
the
people
wo
be
scared
i
will
say
it
some
stunt
all
right
and
then
jim
began
with
his
sonorous
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
stated
that
the
young
would
show
his
familiarity
with
and
mastery
over
fire
by
setting
himself
ablaze
and
leaping
into
the
tank
to
extinguish
the
flames
the
ringmaster
added
that
there
would
be
no
danger
to
either
the
audience
or
the
performer
in
this
feature
joe
bowed
to
the
applause
that
followed
and
then
hurried
to
his
dressing
room
to
don
dry
clothes
for
his
mystery
box
trick
i
should
think
if
you
were
going
to
do
tank
work
you
wear
a
suit
better
adapted
to
it
like
mine
said
benny
turton
whose
apartment
was
next
to
joe
in
the
dressing
tent
i
going
to
joe
announced
looking
around
to
make
sure
no
one
overheard
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
benny
i
did
count
on
pulling
off
this
stunt
it
was
an
accident
some
of
the
alcohol
i
use
on
the
tow
was
spilled
on
my
sleeves
and
caught
fire
then
more
flames
burst
out
luckily
they
were
at
my
back
so
when
i
ran
the
flames
were
fanned
away
from
me
but
i
knew
the
tank
was
the
safest
place
to
go
and
in
i
jumped
but
i
heard
you
tell
jim
it
was
all
arranged
i
did
that
so
the
crowd
would
get
into
a
panic
however
i
am
going
to
work
the
trick
at
each
performance
after
this
only
i
going
to
wear
a
different
suit
and
joe
did
he
had
a
garment
partly
made
of
asbestos
though
outwardly
it
did
not
resemble
that
material
any
more
than
do
the
asbestos
curtains
in
theaters
and
at
the
conclusion
of
his
act
joe
would
seemingly
burst
into
fire
and
run
blazing
across
the
stage
to
leap
into
the
tank
of
water
this
finish
to
the
act
never
failed
to
win
great
applause
and
once
in
the
tank
joe
did
some
of
the
tricks
that
had
brought
him
fame
he
was
careful
however
not
to
duplicate
anything
that
benny
turton
did
for
he
did
not
want
to
crab
the
act
of
his
friend
but
joe
fire
and
water
act
was
one
of
the
big
features
on
the
circus
bill
is
this
the
sensation
you
were
speaking
of
asked
helen
one
day
when
they
had
concluded
an
afternoon
performance
no
answered
joe
this
only
came
about
by
accident
i
working
on
something
more
sensational
yet
and
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
help
me
i
sure
i
do
anything
i
can
said
she
you
wo
be
in
any
danger
the
young
magician
went
on
i
beginning
to
understand
fire
better
the
more
i
study
it
i
not
getting
too
familiar
either
let
me
tell
you
even
a
little
scorch
is
very
painful
i
glanced
through
one
of
your
books
the
other
day
remarked
helen
do
you
really
suppose
some
of
those
old
magicians
actually
handled
fire
in
the
way
it
is
stated
well
at
least
they
pretended
to
said
her
friend
there
are
tricks
in
all
trades
you
know
as
the
circus
went
on
its
way
business
kept
up
well
and
it
was
seen
that
the
season
was
going
to
be
an
excellent
one
from
a
financial
standpoint
any
more
bogus
tickets
coming
in
asked
joe
one
day
of
the
treasurer
not
since
we
adopted
the
new
style
was
the
answer
have
the
detectives
gotten
on
the
trail
of
the
man
or
the
men
who
cheated
us
asked
helen
not
yet
reported
moyne
the
last
report
i
had
from
them
was
that
they
were
getting
nearer
and
nearer
to
a
certain
person
whom
they
suspected
they
promise
an
arrest
soon
that
the
usual
story
remarked
joe
however
we
do
so
much
care
about
an
arrest
now
if
we
have
stopped
the
counterfeit
tickets
from
being
worked
off
on
us
well
there
always
a
chance
that
the
same
thing
will
happen
again
returned
moyne
it
too
easy
money
for
the
criminals
to
give
up
i
afraid
i
on
the
lookout
every
day
for
more
counterfeits
well
i
leave
it
to
you
remarked
joe
whenever
anything
happens
let
me
know
and
we
take
some
action
joe
strong
was
now
kept
very
busy
in
the
circus
in
fact
he
was
what
would
be
called
a
star
he
did
his
mystery
box
trick
and
with
helen
worked
the
vanishing
lady
trick
so
neatly
that
no
one
guessed
how
it
was
done
the
ten
thousand
dollars
was
not
claimed
successfully
though
several
tried
it
with
the
result
that
several
local
red
cross
organizations
were
enriched
by
the
hundred
dollar
forfeit
in
addition
to
these
mystery
acts
and
some
more
ordinary
tricks
which
he
used
to
fill
in
with
joe
did
his
trick
ending
that
act
with
the
plunge
into
the
tank
this
never
failed
to
create
a
sensation
but
it
is
the
big
sensation
i
after
said
joe
when
his
friends
congratulated
him
wait
until
you
see
that
another
feature
of
joe
performance
was
his
since
he
had
rescued
the
lady
cat
he
had
added
this
to
his
share
of
the
program
and
it
was
a
thriller
enjoyed
by
many
audiences
but
it
a
little
tame
said
joe
one
day
to
jim
tracy
i
want
to
put
a
little
more
pep
into
it
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
asked
the
ringmaster
i
think
i
know
a
way
was
the
answer
and
a
few
days
later
joe
gave
a
demonstration
the
wire
on
which
he
performed
was
a
high
one
stretched
between
two
poles
on
each
pole
was
fastened
a
small
platform
somewhat
like
those
high
up
in
the
tent
where
the
big
swing
was
fastened
joe
walked
across
the
wire
from
one
platform
to
the
other
doing
various
stunts
on
the
slender
support
one
day
jim
tracy
noticed
that
a
long
to
the
ground
between
one
of
the
rings
and
a
wooden
platform
what
that
joe
asked
the
ringmaster
looks
like
an
extra
guy
wire
for
the
pole
no
that
for
my
new
stunt
said
joe
i
show
you
at
this
show
the
audience
watched
him
performing
on
the
high
wire
jim
tracy
was
watching
too
for
he
remembered
what
joe
had
said
suddenly
at
the
conclusion
of
the
usual
feats
joe
stooped
placed
his
head
on
the
slanting
wire
raised
himself
until
he
was
standing
with
his
legs
up
and
spread
apart
then
he
quickly
flung
wide
his
hands
and
slid
on
his
head
down
the
slanting
win
to
the
ground
stopping
himself
just
before
he
reached
it
by
grasping
the
wire
in
his
gloved
hands
jim
tracy
who
was
sitting
on
a
box
leaped
to
his
feat
head
first
he
cried
that
some
stunt
and
the
audience
seemed
to
think
so
too
from
the
way
it
applauded
chapter
xv
the
swindlers
again
joe
strong
having
checked
his
rapid
and
slide
down
the
slanting
wire
by
grasping
it
in
his
gloved
hands
gave
a
and
stood
up
bowing
to
the
loud
applause
jim
tracy
and
some
of
the
other
circus
employees
surrounded
the
young
man
why
did
you
tell
us
you
were
going
to
pull
off
something
like
this
demanded
the
ringmaster
because
i
was
sure
until
the
last
minute
that
i
would
do
it
answered
joe
i
had
practiced
it
as
much
as
i
should
have
liked
but
when
i
got
up
there
on
the
platform
i
felt
pretty
sure
i
could
do
it
i
was
running
much
risk
anyhow
except
that
of
failure
i
knew
i
would
fall
for
i
could
have
grabbed
the
wire
in
my
hands
if
i
had
started
to
topple
over
but
how
did
you
do
it
asked
some
one
who
came
up
to
join
the
wondering
throng
after
joe
feat
had
been
performed
i
seen
you
stand
on
your
head
before
but
to
slide
down
a
wire
say
what
sort
of
scalp
have
you
anyhow
joe
laughed
and
held
out
a
of
leather
fastened
to
the
leather
was
a
small
steel
framework
and
in
this
frame
were
two
small
grooved
wheels
like
the
wheels
of
a
trolley
by
means
of
which
street
cars
receive
the
electric
current
from
the
wire
joe
put
the
cap
on
his
head
to
show
how
it
enabled
him
to
do
the
trick
the
big
races
were
on
now
as
the
close
of
the
performance
was
close
at
hand
and
the
crowd
was
paying
attention
to
the
contests
and
not
to
the
group
of
performers
surrounding
the
young
magician
once
they
had
seen
the
cap
with
the
grooved
wheels
on
top
placed
on
joe
head
his
friends
understood
how
the
trick
was
done
he
had
simply
to
balance
himself
on
his
head
on
the
wire
a
feat
he
had
often
performed
before
the
natural
attraction
of
gravitation
did
the
rest
he
simply
slid
down
on
the
wheels
his
extended
arms
and
legs
steadying
him
it
just
as
if
you
had
a
roller
skate
on
your
head
said
señorita
tanlozo
the
snake
charmer
who
had
strolled
into
the
main
tent
after
her
act
in
the
side
show
was
over
exactly
said
joe
with
a
smile
would
you
like
to
try
it
not
while
my
snakes
are
alive
she
assured
him
well
it
another
drawing
card
for
the
sampson
brothers
show
said
jim
tracy
that
night
when
the
receipts
were
being
counted
and
preparations
being
made
for
moving
on
to
the
next
city
how
long
are
you
going
to
keep
it
up
joe
as
to
that
i
ca
say
was
the
answer
but
i
like
the
game
and
i
want
to
see
the
circus
a
success
it
a
big
one
now
thanks
in
a
large
part
to
you
observed
the
ringmaster
but
you
better
take
a
rest
now
joe
my
boy
do
try
to
pull
off
any
more
spectacular
stunts
oh
i
have
pulled
off
my
big
one
yet
replied
the
young
magician
i
mean
the
one
with
the
fire
i
working
on
that
if
it
comes
out
the
way
i
think
it
will
we
have
to
give
three
performances
a
day
instead
of
two
oh
we
ca
do
that
protested
moyne
the
treasurer
it
hard
enough
keeping
account
of
the
money
and
tickets
now
with
two
shows
a
day
if
we
have
three
he
paused
for
it
was
very
evident
joe
was
only
joking
and
there
were
smiles
on
the
faces
of
the
other
circus
folk
do
worry
said
joe
to
the
treasurer
i
do
want
to
act
three
times
a
day
any
more
than
you
want
to
count
the
tickets
and
cash
and
i
suppose
if
we
could
by
some
means
give
three
performances
it
would
only
give
our
swindling
ticket
friends
more
chance
to
work
their
scheme
by
the
way
there
are
no
further
signs
of
their
putting
bogus
tickets
on
sale
are
there
not
since
we
started
the
detectives
at
work
the
treasurer
answered
but
i
always
on
the
watch
and
so
are
the
men
at
the
entrances
it
about
time
those
detectives
got
results
i
think
declared
jim
tracy
i
wonder
what
they
think
we
paying
them
for
it
takes
time
for
a
thing
like
that
to
be
cleaned
up
said
joe
well
i
know
what
i
do
if
i
were
detecting
the
ringmaster
what
inquired
the
treasurer
i
round
up
and
arrest
a
certain
few
worthless
men
i
know
who
used
to
be
in
the
circus
business
some
with
this
show
declared
jim
queer
but
our
outfit
seems
to
be
the
only
one
that
they
pick
on
what
makes
me
think
it
was
some
one
who
used
to
work
for
us
who
the
treasurer
wanted
to
know
well
i
not
mentioning
any
names
declared
the
ringmaster
as
he
prepared
to
divest
himself
of
his
dress
suit
in
readiness
for
the
trip
to
the
circus
train
but
i
have
my
suspicions
what
makes
you
say
ours
is
the
only
circus
to
have
lost
money
on
bogus
tickets
asked
joe
read
it
in
and
was
the
answer
that
was
the
name
of
the
trade
journal
devoted
to
the
interests
of
circus
folk
tent
shows
and
the
like
the
last
number
had
a
piece
in
it
about
our
losing
money
on
fake
tickets
went
on
the
ringmaster
and
it
said
it
was
the
first
case
of
its
kind
to
appear
in
several
years
there
have
been
no
complaints
of
circuses
in
other
parts
of
the
country
being
cheated
that
way
this
article
said
so
i
know
it
some
one
picking
specially
on
us
well
perhaps
you
right
assented
joe
but
as
long
as
we
have
changed
our
style
of
tickets
and
they
have
tried
their
tricks
again
maybe
we
settled
them
all
the
same
i
going
to
be
on
the
watch
declared
the
treasurer
the
city
where
the
circus
showed
the
following
day
and
night
was
a
large
one
a
new
automobile
industry
employing
many
hands
had
located
there
within
the
last
six
months
it
was
decided
to
make
a
stay
of
two
days
in
this
place
since
the
advance
agent
reported
that
many
of
the
men
worked
overtime
and
nights
and
otherwise
they
could
not
see
the
performance
well
i
glad
we
to
be
here
two
days
remarked
helen
as
she
passed
joe
private
quarters
where
he
was
going
over
some
of
his
apparatus
costumes
and
effects
yes
we
have
a
good
night
rest
he
agreed
though
truth
to
tell
the
circus
folk
were
so
used
to
traveling
that
the
train
journey
almost
every
night
did
not
bother
them
still
they
always
welcomed
a
stay
in
a
city
over
night
you
seem
busy
remarked
helen
as
she
sat
down
on
a
box
and
watched
joe
yes
i
going
to
introduce
a
little
novelty
in
the
slide
down
the
slanting
wire
he
answered
i
going
to
work
in
a
fire
stunt
a
fire
stunt
exclaimed
helen
surely
you
are
going
to
oh
it
wo
be
dangerous
joe
assured
her
guessing
her
thoughts
helen
had
learned
that
the
jump
into
benny
tank
the
first
time
was
due
to
an
accident
it
just
a
bit
spectacular
and
will
liven
things
up
a
bit
i
think
if
it
goes
well
i
have
an
idea
you
can
work
one
of
the
features
in
your
bareback
act
oh
joe
i
never
could
walk
a
wire
nor
slide
down
on
my
head
the
way
you
do
and
i
do
see
how
rosebud
could
either
and
helen
gave
a
merry
little
laugh
at
the
vision
she
raised
oh
i
not
going
to
have
your
horse
walk
the
tight
rope
nor
the
high
wire
laughed
joe
it
would
be
a
corking
good
stunt
if
we
could
though
no
this
is
simpler
i
tell
you
about
it
later
watson
wife
of
the
veteran
clown
called
for
helen
just
then
asking
her
to
go
to
see
one
of
the
women
performers
who
was
i
see
you
later
joe
helen
called
out
as
she
left
him
joe
was
busy
mixing
up
some
chemicals
in
a
pail
on
the
ground
outside
his
tent
when
he
was
accosted
by
a
rather
hoarse
voice
asking
any
chance
for
a
job
here
boss
joe
looked
up
to
see
a
somewhat
disreputable
figure
of
a
man
observing
him
the
fellow
looked
like
the
typical
tramp
perhaps
not
quite
so
ragged
and
dirty
but
still
in
that
class
however
there
was
something
about
the
man
that
attracted
attention
as
he
said
afterward
his
visitor
had
about
him
the
air
of
the
profesh
joe
first
impulse
was
to
say
that
he
knew
of
no
job
or
else
to
refer
his
accoster
to
the
head
canvas
man
who
hired
transient
help
in
putting
up
the
main
top
and
in
pulling
or
driving
stakes
but
as
joe
observed
the
man
curiously
watching
him
he
had
another
idea
before
he
could
act
on
it
however
the
man
exclaimed
you
do
a
stunt
do
you
yes
joe
answered
and
then
it
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
how
the
man
knew
true
he
might
have
observed
joe
in
some
of
the
many
performances
but
the
man
did
not
look
like
one
who
would
spend
money
on
circus
tickets
he
might
have
crawled
under
the
tent
but
it
did
not
seem
exactly
probable
and
of
course
some
of
the
circus
employees
plight
have
pointed
joe
out
to
the
man
as
the
actor
who
handled
fire
but
again
joe
did
not
believe
this
so
he
asked
how
did
you
know
for
answer
the
man
pointed
to
the
pail
of
chemicals
into
which
joe
was
about
to
dip
a
suit
of
tights
smelled
the
dope
was
the
brief
answer
you
using
tungstate
of
soda
are
you
yes
answered
joe
surprised
that
a
man
evidently
of
such
a
class
should
recognize
the
not
very
common
chemical
we
used
to
use
alum
in
the
old
days
the
man
went
on
i
guess
the
new
dope
better
though
i
never
tried
it
are
you
in
the
business
asked
joe
well
i
er
i
used
to
be
and
the
man
straightened
himself
up
with
an
air
of
forgotten
pride
i
was
with
a
circus
once
used
to
do
a
act
and
jump
into
a
fake
bonfire
i
doped
my
clothes
with
alum
water
though
that
great
stuff
for
preventing
the
fire
taking
hold
if
you
do
stay
in
the
blaze
too
long
but
as
i
say
discovered
something
new
you
used
to
be
a
asked
joe
curiously
yes
and
i
was
counted
a
pretty
good
one
but
i
lost
my
nerve
how
well
er
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
i
got
too
fond
of
the
could
stay
on
the
long
enough
got
careless
in
my
act
went
down
and
out
oh
it
the
old
story
you
probably
heard
it
lots
of
times
but
i
would
like
a
job
now
i
actually
hungry
and
i
seen
the
time
i
could
blow
the
bunch
to
champagne
and
lobster
joe
on
impulse
and
yet
too
because
he
had
an
object
was
just
going
to
offer
the
man
help
when
he
saw
moyne
coming
across
the
lot
toward
him
from
the
ticket
wagon
the
afternoon
performance
was
about
to
start
they
here
again
cried
the
treasurer
who
asked
joe
the
ticket
swindlers
chapter
xvi
rings
of
fire
instantly
joe
strong
lost
interest
in
the
tramp
as
he
afterward
came
to
call
the
man
all
the
attention
of
the
young
magician
was
centered
on
what
the
treasurer
had
said
are
you
certain
of
this
asked
joe
positive
was
the
answer
we
been
keeping
careful
watch
paying
special
attention
to
the
red
serial
numbers
and
some
duplicates
have
been
taken
in
at
the
main
entrance
the
swindlers
are
at
work
again
but
our
new
tickets
exclaimed
joe
the
new
style
of
paper
and
the
precautions
we
have
taken
what
of
that
in
answer
moyne
held
out
two
tickets
both
bearing
the
same
serial
number
in
red
ink
which
is
the
bogus
and
which
is
the
genuine
he
asked
joe
looked
carefully
at
the
two
he
examined
them
for
a
full
minute
i
ca
tell
he
admitted
and
no
one
else
can
either
declared
the
treasurer
we
up
against
it
again
those
fellows
are
too
clever
for
us
now
we
lose
a
lot
of
money
well
it
wo
break
us
said
joe
easily
though
of
course
no
one
likes
to
be
cheated
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
get
the
detectives
busy
let
them
know
the
new
turn
affairs
have
taken
and
i
send
these
two
tickets
to
our
chemist
friend
he
can
tell
which
is
printed
from
our
regular
stock
and
which
is
the
counterfeit
then
too
it
ought
to
be
easier
to
catch
the
rascals
now
than
it
was
at
first
you
see
we
did
know
how
long
the
old
tickets
had
been
counterfeited
now
we
warned
first
shot
out
of
the
box
about
the
new
ones
and
since
the
paper
mill
has
been
supplying
our
printer
with
the
new
kind
of
paper
very
long
it
ought
to
be
easy
to
trace
where
the
new
and
clever
counterfeit
supply
is
coming
from
well
i
hope
they
can
catch
the
scoundrels
said
moyne
i
certainly
hate
to
see
money
lost
moyne
was
an
ideal
treasurer
he
always
had
the
interests
of
the
circus
at
heart
and
one
would
think
that
the
money
came
out
of
his
own
pocket
to
hear
him
talk
about
the
counterfeit
tickets
in
a
way
he
did
lose
personally
since
he
was
one
of
the
owners
of
the
show
and
the
less
money
that
came
in
the
less
his
stock
dividends
would
amount
to
i
write
to
waldon
said
joe
as
he
took
the
two
tickets
and
we
notify
the
detectives
now
i
must
get
ready
for
my
act
that
ca
be
dropped
having
trouble
eh
asked
the
tramp
who
had
moved
a
little
to
one
side
oh
well
just
a
little
admitted
joe
who
was
not
altogether
pleased
that
this
talk
should
have
been
overheard
by
a
stranger
did
you
say
there
was
any
chance
for
a
job
asked
the
ragged
man
well
i
do
know
said
joe
rather
doubtfully
is
that
straight
goods
about
your
being
a
i
was
once
but
i
not
looking
for
that
kind
of
a
job
now
was
the
quick
answer
i
lost
my
nerve
i
tell
you
handling
stakes
or
driving
a
wagon
would
be
my
limit
what
sort
of
an
act
in
the
fire
line
did
you
have
asked
joe
for
a
certain
idea
was
beginning
to
form
in
his
mind
it
was
a
good
act
was
the
response
and
again
the
spark
of
pride
seemed
about
to
be
fanned
into
a
flame
got
any
in
this
here
circus
of
yours
yes
answered
joe
there
jim
tracy
and
bill
watson
and
bill
watson
who
used
to
clown
it
cried
the
man
eagerly
he
clowns
it
yet
old
bill
murmured
the
tramp
him
still
making
good
in
the
business
and
me
a
bum
well
it
all
my
own
fault
if
i
stuck
to
the
and
not
drinking
i
be
somewhere
just
ask
bill
watson
what
sort
of
an
act
ham
logan
had
logan
exclaimed
the
man
that
was
my
title
hamilton
logan
is
my
name
but
i
have
told
any
one
in
not
in
a
long
time
he
added
and
he
looked
away
but
ask
bill
watson
about
me
here
he
comes
now
said
joe
as
he
observed
the
veteran
clown
approaching
suppose
you
ask
him
yourself
for
an
instant
ham
logan
hesitated
then
he
stepped
forward
and
confronted
the
old
clown
the
latter
paid
no
attention
at
first
evidently
thinking
the
man
one
of
the
many
about
a
circus
ground
joe
began
bill
watson
helen
sent
me
to
ask
you
if
you
have
any
ammonia
in
your
kit
i
mean
the
kind
they
give
the
ladies
when
their
hearts
are
weak
or
something
like
that
one
of
the
girls
has
some
kind
of
a
little
spell
and
we
ca
find
the
doctor
yes
i
have
some
ammonia
said
joe
i
get
it
ham
logan
looked
bill
watson
in
the
face
and
asked
do
you
remember
me
ca
say
that
i
do
was
the
somewhat
cool
response
of
the
veteran
clown
is
there
any
reason
why
i
should
do
you
remember
logan
bill
watson
started
looked
more
closely
at
the
man
and
then
slowly
asked
are
you
ham
logan
what
left
of
me
yes
well
i
be
gum
swizzled
exclaimed
bill
say
did
the
elephant
step
on
you
or
one
of
the
tent
wagons
roll
over
you
neither
one
i
down
and
out
that
all
and
it
enough
too
well
that
enough
i
should
say
commented
the
clown
as
he
took
the
bottle
of
stimulant
joe
handed
him
last
i
heard
of
you
you
gone
on
a
theater
circuit
that
was
just
after
you
quit
the
dobling
show
yes
i
did
do
a
theater
circuit
admitted
ham
logan
but
it
last
or
rather
i
did
last
i
was
just
asking
the
young
man
here
for
a
job
i
said
you
remember
me
well
i
certainly
do
returned
the
old
clown
who
was
not
to
do
his
act
until
later
in
the
day
and
i
sorry
to
see
you
in
this
state
ham
you
did
me
a
good
turn
once
and
i
have
forgotten
stick
around
a
while
and
i
see
you
as
soon
as
i
play
joe
if
it
is
asking
too
much
will
you
look
after
ham
for
a
while
he
used
to
be
a
good
sort
and
better
say
too
much
of
a
paraphrased
the
man
i
take
care
of
him
promised
joe
did
you
say
you
were
hungry
asked
the
young
magician
as
the
old
clown
turned
and
hurried
away
with
the
ammonia
you
said
it
but
i
not
altogether
a
grafter
i
can
work
for
what
i
eat
and
again
there
was
a
flash
of
pride
we
talk
of
that
later
said
joe
just
now
i
want
to
get
you
something
to
eat
here
take
that
over
to
the
dining
tent
and
he
scribbled
a
few
words
on
one
of
his
cards
after
you
eaten
all
you
want
and
after
the
show
this
afternoon
look
me
up
do
you
think
you
can
give
me
work
asked
the
man
eagerly
i
mean
to
act
he
hastened
to
say
i
past
that
down
and
out
but
strong
i
can
pull
on
the
ropes
or
drive
stakes
we
talk
of
that
later
replied
joe
gently
go
and
eat
now
well
i
sure
can
feed
my
face
exclaimed
the
man
i
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
bill
will
tell
you
that
i
was
a
bad
fellow
in
my
day
i
just
lost
my
nerve
that
all
false
friends
and
see
me
later
said
joe
with
a
friendly
wave
of
his
hand
and
the
man
hurried
toward
the
dining
tent
next
to
the
cook
wagons
already
he
seemed
imbued
with
more
hope
and
pride
something
that
filled
joe
with
pleasure
joe
busied
himself
with
mixing
the
chemicals
in
the
pail
as
ham
logan
had
guessed
the
young
was
mixing
up
a
solution
of
tungstate
of
soda
this
chemical
is
a
salt
made
by
roasting
wolfram
with
soda
ash
and
wolfram
is
a
native
tungstate
of
iron
and
manganese
this
soda
preparation
is
used
commercially
in
making
garments
and
joe
had
learned
this
from
herbert
waldon
the
chemist
he
had
decided
to
use
this
instead
of
an
alum
solution
which
is
credited
with
great
qualities
it
has
them
too
to
a
certain
extent
but
by
experimenting
joe
had
found
the
tungstate
of
soda
best
it
was
the
evening
of
the
circus
in
the
city
in
which
the
show
was
to
remain
two
days
ham
logan
had
returned
to
joe
after
having
eaten
a
good
meal
and
later
bill
watson
formed
the
third
member
of
a
trio
that
talked
for
some
time
in
a
corner
of
joe
tent
as
already
said
it
was
the
evening
performance
and
as
helen
finished
her
act
on
rosebud
she
looked
over
toward
the
place
where
joe
was
preparing
to
do
his
slide
down
the
slanting
wire
i
wonder
what
he
had
in
mind
as
a
new
act
for
me
mused
helen
i
do
hope
it
is
anything
to
do
with
fire
that
sort
of
stunt
creates
a
sensation
but
it
dangerous
in
spite
of
what
joe
does
to
himself
i
do
like
it
not
after
what
happened
to
joe
that
day
she
had
seen
that
rosebud
was
given
in
charge
of
the
groom
who
always
looked
after
the
clever
steed
and
now
helen
moved
over
where
she
could
watch
joe
comparatively
new
wire
act
as
she
approached
this
part
of
the
circus
tent
helen
was
startled
to
see
several
men
carrying
large
hoops
on
long
poles
take
their
positions
on
either
side
of
the
slanting
wire
down
which
the
daring
performer
was
soon
to
slide
on
his
head
by
means
of
the
wheeled
cap
that
something
new
exclaimed
helen
as
she
saw
the
men
with
the
big
hoops
i
wonder
if
joe
is
going
to
jump
through
them
as
i
jump
through
the
paper
hoops
from
rosebud
back
joe
was
up
on
the
little
platform
now
having
finished
his
wire
act
he
was
adjusting
to
his
head
the
leather
cap
ladies
and
gentlemen
began
jim
tracy
in
his
sonorous
voice
as
he
pointed
to
joe
on
his
high
perch
thus
calling
attention
to
the
performer
all
eyes
were
turned
in
his
direction
then
as
joe
stooped
over
and
stood
on
his
head
preparatory
to
sliding
down
the
wire
the
hoops
which
the
men
held
over
the
cable
by
means
of
long
poles
suddenly
burst
into
flame
held
over
the
wire
down
which
joe
would
in
a
moment
slide
was
a
row
of
fiery
circles
helen
held
her
hand
over
her
lips
to
stifle
a
scream
chapter
xvii
the
broken
bottle
so
still
was
it
in
the
big
circus
tent
after
the
band
stopped
playing
while
joe
prepared
to
do
his
head
slide
that
the
whirr
of
the
steel
wheels
in
his
leather
cap
could
plainly
be
heard
as
he
slid
down
the
wire
and
as
helen
and
the
others
watched
the
intention
of
the
daring
young
performer
became
evident
he
was
going
to
coast
through
the
blazing
hoops
of
fire
which
the
men
held
in
such
a
position
that
joe
could
slide
through
them
without
touching
them
though
they
were
called
hoops
in
reality
they
were
not
completely
closed
there
being
a
slight
opening
to
enable
them
to
be
slipped
over
the
slanting
wire
if
a
gigantic
letter
c
with
a
long
pole
fastened
to
the
lower
curved
part
can
be
imagined
it
will
give
an
exact
idea
of
what
is
meant
as
to
the
fire
itself
it
was
caused
by
blazing
bits
of
tow
fastened
to
the
circumference
of
the
big
wire
hoops
and
thus
through
the
blazing
circles
joe
strong
slid
down
the
slanting
wire
on
his
head
at
the
lower
end
of
the
wire
where
it
was
fast
to
a
stake
in
the
ground
he
caught
hold
of
the
cable
in
his
gloved
hands
and
so
slowed
his
speed
then
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
bowed
in
acknowledgment
of
the
applause
oh
murmured
helen
as
she
watched
it
was
only
another
of
his
sensational
acts
when
i
first
saw
the
blazing
hoops
i
half
thought
that
some
one
was
trying
to
injure
joe
as
they
did
when
the
acid
was
used
on
his
high
trapeze
oh
it
was
only
a
trick
and
so
it
was
joe
had
planned
it
that
day
after
meeting
ham
logan
the
latter
talking
about
the
time
when
he
too
had
been
a
had
mentioned
an
act
where
a
performer
leaped
through
blazing
hoops
and
joe
determined
to
use
the
idea
varying
it
to
suit
his
purpose
that
it
was
effective
was
evidenced
by
the
applause
but
joe
asked
helen
when
the
performance
was
over
and
she
and
joe
had
received
another
ovation
at
the
conclusion
of
the
box
mystery
and
the
vanishing
lady
trick
was
there
danger
of
setting
your
clothes
on
fire
when
you
went
through
the
blazing
hoops
none
at
all
joe
assured
her
i
have
been
planning
a
stunt
like
this
for
some
time
and
my
garments
were
of
course
i
have
done
it
otherwise
look
here
he
took
up
a
fancy
jacket
he
had
worn
in
his
wire
slide
taking
a
match
joe
lighted
it
and
held
it
against
the
cloth
it
did
not
take
fire
there
was
that
day
but
i
have
perfected
the
act
since
then
helen
of
course
the
tungstate
of
soda
that
i
soaked
the
clothes
in
would
keep
them
from
catching
fire
if
i
put
the
suit
in
a
furnace
but
the
solution
will
make
cloth
resist
a
blaze
temporarily
as
will
alum
under
some
circumstances
i
use
alum
on
the
suit
i
wear
when
i
pretend
to
set
myself
on
fire
and
then
jump
into
the
tank
of
water
went
on
joe
but
after
this
i
going
to
use
the
soda
it
more
certain
joe
worked
the
trick
of
seeming
to
set
himself
ablaze
in
this
way
as
he
said
his
suit
was
made
as
nearly
fireproof
as
possible
then
on
the
back
of
his
jacket
were
placed
some
bunches
of
tow
saturated
with
alcohol
when
this
tow
was
set
on
fire
it
burned
quickly
but
joe
knew
the
flame
would
not
last
long
and
the
fact
that
the
garments
on
which
the
burning
material
was
fastened
were
as
nearly
fireproof
as
was
possible
to
make
them
gave
him
additional
safety
he
really
ran
little
risk
as
the
fire
was
at
his
back
and
as
he
ran
toward
the
tank
his
speed
carried
the
flames
away
from
him
joe
and
all
others
who
do
a
act
calculate
to
a
nicety
just
how
long
a
certain
fire
will
burn
and
they
do
not
place
the
blazing
material
into
the
mouth
until
the
flames
are
almost
on
the
point
of
going
out
of
themselves
this
added
to
the
fact
that
a
chemical
solution
protects
the
tongue
and
lips
makes
the
act
comparatively
safe
but
one
word
of
caution
not
try
to
the
mouth
with
tungstate
of
this
warning
can
not
be
made
too
strong
in
fact
it
is
well
not
to
try
any
it
is
too
risky
unless
one
is
a
professional
well
joe
remarked
jim
tracy
later
that
night
when
most
of
the
circus
folk
were
asleep
if
you
want
to
add
this
fellow
to
our
show
go
ahead
you
have
the
say
you
know
well
i
do
want
to
do
it
in
just
that
way
replied
the
young
bill
watson
says
that
ham
logan
was
once
a
good
man
he
is
down
and
out
now
but
he
knows
a
lot
about
circus
life
and
this
handling
of
fire
i
believe
i
can
work
him
up
into
something
useful
use
him
in
a
new
act
i
thinking
of
putting
on
if
we
can
only
keep
him
away
from
intoxicants
he
be
all
right
and
i
like
to
give
him
a
chance
well
joe
as
i
said
it
up
to
you
go
to
it
but
remember
while
he
means
all
right
he
may
not
have
the
spunk
to
keep
his
promise
not
to
drink
i
think
he
keep
it
said
joe
anyhow
i
like
to
give
him
a
trial
he
helped
me
with
that
fire
hoop
stunt
and
it
would
be
an
act
of
charity
to
give
him
work
all
right
you
can
be
the
charity
said
the
ringmaster
what
do
you
say
bill
watson
oh
give
him
a
chance
replied
the
old
clown
we
all
have
our
troubles
he
ca
do
much
harm
anyhow
i
do
know
about
that
said
jim
with
a
shake
of
his
head
this
playing
with
fire
by
a
man
who
ca
keep
away
from
is
risky
well
i
take
the
chance
said
joe
and
that
was
characteristic
of
him
taking
chances
ham
logan
was
deeply
grateful
to
joe
for
what
the
young
performer
did
that
is
he
hired
the
former
as
a
sort
of
handy
man
in
the
circus
ham
to
be
subject
to
joe
direction
day
and
night
and
let
the
alone
demanded
joe
i
will
i
really
will
said
the
old
circus
performer
he
seemed
to
mean
it
joe
advanced
him
money
enough
to
get
some
better
clothes
to
have
a
bath
and
be
shaved
and
it
was
quite
a
different
person
who
appeared
at
the
tent
the
following
day
ready
to
help
joe
as
ham
knew
more
about
fire
than
any
assistant
joe
had
yet
been
able
to
train
the
new
man
was
given
charge
of
the
various
apparatus
joe
used
in
his
sensational
acts
including
the
one
of
sliding
down
the
wire
on
his
head
through
the
blazing
hoops
one
matter
bothered
joe
and
his
friends
in
spite
of
the
great
success
the
circus
was
having
and
this
was
the
bogus
tickets
several
hundred
of
them
were
presented
at
the
performances
in
the
city
where
the
stay
was
made
the
city
already
mentioned
as
being
the
location
of
a
big
automobile
industry
and
where
the
tickets
came
from
remained
a
mystery
they
were
so
nearly
like
the
ones
issued
from
the
ticket
wagon
that
not
until
duplicate
numbers
had
been
observed
could
the
fraud
be
detected
and
as
the
men
at
the
main
entrances
had
no
time
in
the
rush
to
compare
serial
numbers
there
seemed
no
way
of
stopping
the
cheating
it
was
impossible
to
see
to
it
that
every
one
who
came
to
the
show
purchased
admission
tickets
at
the
wagon
the
surging
crowds
around
prevented
this
men
engaged
by
the
circus
circulated
through
the
throngs
about
the
tent
seeking
to
learn
whether
any
unauthorized
persons
were
selling
bogus
tickets
but
none
was
seen
it
is
evident
said
moyne
that
the
counterfeiters
get
a
bunch
of
the
fake
tickets
and
sell
them
in
large
lots
to
some
men
these
men
in
turn
dispose
of
them
at
reduced
prices
to
others
and
perhaps
the
persons
who
use
the
tickets
do
not
know
they
are
counterfeits
i
believe
the
swindlers
go
to
the
big
factories
and
stores
and
sell
the
tickets
at
a
slightly
lower
price
than
we
ask
we
ought
to
be
able
to
put
a
stop
to
that
said
joe
we
try
it
said
the
treasurer
it
seems
the
only
way
that
and
having
the
detectives
stop
the
fraud
at
the
source
you
see
we
tell
which
are
the
counterfeit
tickets
until
after
we
check
up
the
serial
numbers
that
what
makes
it
so
hard
and
so
in
spite
of
the
success
of
joe
acts
and
the
success
of
the
show
in
general
there
was
this
element
of
annoyance
joe
wished
the
mystery
could
be
cleared
up
he
had
received
back
from
the
chemist
the
two
tickets
sent
on
last
and
the
counterfeit
was
marked
this
was
sent
to
the
paper
mill
and
the
detectives
notified
that
was
all
that
could
be
done
for
the
present
well
how
logan
making
out
asked
bill
watson
of
joe
one
day
just
before
an
afternoon
performance
very
good
was
the
answer
he
faithful
and
steady
and
he
good
help
to
me
he
certainly
knows
the
stunt
well
as
long
as
he
does
do
any
maybe
he
be
all
right
said
the
old
clown
i
have
noticed
any
lapse
said
joe
i
have
great
hopes
of
him
but
that
very
afternoon
during
the
performance
joe
felt
doubt
beginning
to
creep
over
him
he
caught
ham
in
several
mistakes
slight
ones
but
enough
if
not
noticed
in
time
to
have
spoiled
the
act
i
wonder
what
the
matter
is
with
him
mused
joe
he
does
seem
to
have
been
drinking
and
yet
he
acts
queer
i
wonder
if
he
can
be
using
drugs
it
was
at
the
close
of
the
act
and
the
of
the
circus
for
the
afternoon
that
joe
told
ham
to
put
away
some
of
the
apparatus
until
evening
joe
was
called
away
from
his
dressing
room
for
a
moment
and
when
he
came
back
he
saw
ham
hastily
throw
away
a
dark
brown
bottle
which
struck
on
a
stone
and
broke
immediately
a
queer
odor
filled
the
air
i
wonder
if
that
was
liquor
he
was
taking
and
if
he
threw
away
the
empty
bottle
thought
joe
quickly
i
going
to
find
out
i
got
to
stop
this
thing
at
the
start
he
hurried
to
the
place
where
ham
had
tossed
the
bottle
the
fragments
lay
there
and
the
queer
odor
was
more
pronounced
do
touch
that
let
that
bottle
alone
suddenly
cried
ham
logan
as
he
became
aware
of
joe
intention
do
touch
it
chapter
xviii
a
narrow
escape
joe
strong
was
in
two
minds
as
he
heard
this
warning
and
observed
the
face
of
the
man
he
was
befriending
his
first
thought
was
that
ham
had
broken
his
promise
and
was
indulging
in
intoxicants
naturally
the
man
would
want
to
conceal
this
as
long
as
possible
the
other
thought
was
that
the
tramp
was
up
to
some
trick
perhaps
he
was
jealous
of
joe
success
and
his
own
failure
and
wanted
to
spoil
some
of
apparatus
yet
joe
did
not
recognize
as
any
of
his
property
the
brown
bottle
which
when
broken
emitted
such
a
queer
smell
joe
decided
to
investigate
further
and
so
not
heeding
the
warning
call
of
the
former
circus
star
he
walked
closer
to
the
broken
flask
keep
away
from
that
cried
ham
sharply
keep
away
why
asked
joe
with
equal
insistence
because
it
dangerous
was
the
answer
very
dangerous
dangerous
for
you
or
me
joe
wanted
to
know
look
here
ham
he
said
earnestly
are
you
up
to
any
of
your
old
tricks
you
know
what
i
mean
are
you
the
man
flushed
then
looking
joe
straight
in
the
face
he
said
you
have
a
right
to
ask
that
and
i
answer
you
as
straight
i
have
broken
my
promise
that
is
only
the
times
you
know
about
i
have
broken
it
this
time
i
found
that
bottle
in
among
your
things
and
i
was
mighty
sure
it
did
belong
there
what
in
the
bottle
asked
joe
for
though
he
had
dabbled
in
chemistry
he
did
not
recognize
the
queer
odor
a
combination
of
the
strongest
acids
ever
known
was
the
answer
of
ham
logan
a
drop
of
it
makes
a
terrible
burn
and
it
will
eat
through
solid
steel
and
iron
i
knew
that
if
it
broke
where
it
was
among
your
trick
things
a
lot
of
them
would
be
ruined
and
i
knew
you
have
left
the
bottle
there
by
mistake
as
it
was
there
the
last
time
i
packed
away
your
duds
and
i
knew
if
you
knew
what
it
was
you
have
left
it
around
in
that
careless
way
so
taking
no
chances
i
threw
it
away
and
i
meant
to
break
the
bottle
that
acid
is
awful
stuff
best
to
let
it
soak
into
the
ground
come
over
and
see
what
it
does
even
to
earth
and
stones
he
led
the
way
to
where
the
fluid
had
escaped
from
the
broken
flask
the
fragments
of
which
were
scattered
about
the
odor
was
less
strong
now
as
the
acid
was
soaking
into
the
earth
but
there
was
a
fuming
and
bubbling
at
the
spot
and
the
very
stones
and
earth
seemed
to
be
burning
up
in
a
small
area
do
step
in
it
warned
ham
logan
it
will
eat
right
through
your
shoes
glass
is
the
only
thing
it
wo
hurt
glass
and
porcelain
they
mix
it
in
porcelain
retorts
i
throw
some
loose
earth
over
this
place
the
effects
of
the
acid
will
soon
be
lost
but
while
it
active
it
terrible
stuff
believe
me
and
you
say
you
found
that
bottle
in
my
baggage
asked
joe
yes
answered
ham
logan
and
am
i
right
in
saying
you
did
know
it
was
there
i
certainly
did
declared
joe
who
in
the
world
could
have
put
it
there
have
you
any
enemies
asked
ham
i
mean
some
one
who
would
like
to
see
your
circus
acts
spoiled
or
even
see
you
laid
up
for
a
while
well
i
guess
perhaps
there
are
some
i
made
enemies
of
by
having
to
discharge
them
or
something
like
that
admitted
joe
his
thoughts
going
naturally
to
bill
carfax
there
one
man
but
he
has
been
seen
around
for
a
good
while
that
does
count
he
may
have
gotten
some
one
to
do
his
trick
for
him
asserted
ham
you
better
look
out
mr
strong
i
will
declared
joe
and
thank
you
for
your
watchfulness
as
you
say
i
did
know
that
bottle
was
there
and
i
might
have
broken
it
by
accident
or
have
opened
it
and
spilled
some
out
how
did
you
come
to
discover
it
just
by
accident
the
smell
is
something
you
never
forget
it
comes
up
even
around
the
glass
stopper
as
soon
as
i
began
overhauling
your
things
as
you
told
me
to
i
smelled
the
stuff
and
i
went
on
a
still
hunt
for
it
i
was
careful
too
i
knew
what
it
meant
to
get
any
of
that
acid
on
you
or
on
any
of
the
things
about
you
i
used
to
work
in
the
chemical
plant
where
they
made
the
stuff
that
was
after
i
left
the
circus
well
it
ca
do
any
harm
now
he
said
as
he
got
a
shovel
and
covered
with
clean
earth
the
bits
of
broken
glass
and
the
still
fuming
drops
of
add
thank
you
said
joe
fervently
he
went
into
his
private
tent
presently
he
came
out
with
a
bit
of
wire
cable
such
as
is
used
in
making
circus
trapezes
one
end
was
blackened
and
partly
fused
as
though
it
had
been
in
the
fire
joe
held
out
this
bit
of
wire
rope
it
was
part
of
the
trapeze
he
used
in
his
big
swing
what
would
you
say
had
eaten
through
these
strands
he
asked
ham
logan
looked
carefully
at
the
cable
he
sniffed
it
cautiously
he
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
again
smelled
it
it
was
this
same
acid
that
ate
those
strands
he
declared
i
know
how
it
used
to
eat
metal
out
at
the
chemical
works
and
it
does
so
in
a
queer
way
this
wire
rope
is
eaten
through
just
like
that
there
any
odor
left
though
sometimes
it
lasts
a
long
time
but
i
sure
the
same
kind
of
acid
was
used
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
have
been
experimenting
with
it
and
he
looked
in
surprise
at
joe
no
indeed
and
the
young
shook
his
head
i
never
handle
the
acid
and
the
fact
that
the
cable
was
eaten
through
nearly
caused
an
accident
he
then
explained
how
he
had
discovered
the
partly
severed
wire
rope
just
in
time
they
must
have
put
on
a
weak
solution
of
the
acid
declared
ham
otherwise
it
would
have
eaten
the
rope
through
in
jig
time
so
the
game
is
it
well
they
may
have
been
trying
it
on
a
larger
scale
did
you
find
out
who
doped
the
rope
there
was
a
man
who
might
have
done
it
said
joe
thinking
of
harry
loper
but
i
do
believe
he
did
is
he
still
with
the
show
yes
i
tell
you
all
the
circumstances
which
joe
did
mentioning
loper
by
name
well
we
wo
say
anything
declared
ham
logan
but
i
just
keep
my
eyes
on
this
loper
as
you
say
he
may
not
have
done
it
but
he
may
know
who
did
i
keep
my
eyes
on
him
meanwhile
be
careful
in
overhauling
your
things
look
out
for
bottles
that
smell
as
this
one
did
i
will
promised
joe
i
guess
i
wo
forget
that
odor
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
thank
you
ham
you
done
me
a
good
turn
well
you
did
me
one
was
the
answer
i
was
down
and
out
when
you
gave
me
work
and
i
wo
forget
that
in
a
hurry
joe
pondered
over
what
had
happened
as
he
performed
his
circus
acts
the
remainder
of
that
day
and
evening
he
shuddered
at
the
narrow
escape
he
had
had
and
when
he
had
a
chance
he
carefully
noted
the
conduct
of
harry
loper
but
that
young
fellow
did
not
seem
at
all
to
act
like
one
who
had
tried
to
do
a
dastardly
trick
he
was
jolly
and
as
he
always
was
albeit
somewhat
of
a
weak
character
the
circus
performances
went
off
well
joe
and
the
other
actors
receiving
wild
applause
as
they
did
their
specialties
joe
was
eagerly
watched
and
when
he
slid
down
the
rope
on
his
head
through
the
blazing
hoops
the
crowd
went
wild
as
they
did
when
seemingly
all
afire
he
leaped
into
the
tank
when
you
going
to
spring
that
sensation
you
been
talking
of
joe
asked
jim
tracy
at
the
conclusion
of
one
afternoon
show
oh
pretty
soon
now
was
the
reply
ham
logan
and
i
are
working
on
it
ham
logan
is
he
going
to
be
in
it
with
you
asked
the
ringmaster
in
some
surprise
of
course
answered
joe
it
partly
his
idea
he
an
old
you
know
and
he
given
me
some
good
suggestions
yes
going
to
help
me
i
think
we
put
the
act
on
next
week
we
got
to
train
some
new
performers
first
new
performers
say
what
are
you
going
to
do
joe
take
a
troupe
of
actors
out
on
the
road
something
like
that
yes
answered
the
young
magician
with
a
laugh
you
see
joe
strong
varied
his
acts
in
the
circus
tent
sometimes
he
would
omit
the
vanishing
lady
act
as
helen
wanted
to
put
through
some
extra
work
with
rosebud
and
there
was
not
time
for
both
again
he
would
leave
out
some
of
his
acrobatic
work
or
perhaps
not
do
the
trick
of
seeming
to
catch
fire
and
extinguishing
the
flames
in
benny
turton
tank
once
in
a
while
he
would
omit
the
ten
thousand
dollar
mystery
box
trick
but
on
the
day
when
he
had
the
above
conversation
with
jim
tracy
they
were
showing
in
a
large
factory
town
there
had
been
good
business
in
the
afternoon
and
joe
had
not
done
the
box
trick
but
just
before
the
evening
show
jim
came
to
joe
and
said
there
been
several
requests
joe
that
you
put
the
box
trick
on
requests
from
whom
joe
asked
one
of
the
newspaper
men
was
telling
me
they
received
a
lot
of
telephone
calls
asking
if
the
box
trick
would
be
done
and
the
reward
paid
in
case
some
one
discovered
the
way
it
was
done
what
did
you
say
i
said
i
thought
you
put
the
trick
on
in
that
case
do
you
think
you
better
we
did
advertise
it
specially
for
but
there
might
be
a
lot
of
if
we
do
pull
it
off
oh
i
do
it
all
right
declared
joe
i
thought
it
was
getting
a
bit
stale
but
if
the
crowd
wants
to
see
it
i
do
it
i
guess
it
will
be
better
said
the
ringmaster
accordingly
at
the
proper
time
joe
in
his
dazzling
white
suit
took
his
place
in
the
enclosure
helen
in
her
black
dress
was
ready
to
help
him
the
fireman
with
his
gleaming
ax
ready
to
chop
joe
out
of
the
box
in
case
anything
should
go
wrong
was
also
on
the
stage
as
has
been
related
in
the
other
book
this
last
was
done
only
for
effect
joe
well
knew
that
he
could
get
out
of
the
box
the
manager
made
the
usual
offer
of
ten
thousand
dollars
to
be
paid
to
any
one
who
would
disclose
how
the
trick
was
done
you
will
all
be
given
a
chance
to
claim
the
reward
under
the
usual
conditions
after
the
trick
has
been
performed
by
professor
strong
was
the
announcement
made
as
the
description
of
the
manner
in
which
joe
and
helen
did
the
trick
is
given
in
all
its
details
in
the
volume
preceding
this
suffice
it
here
to
say
that
joe
got
into
the
box
which
was
locked
and
roped
and
at
the
proper
time
he
appeared
outside
is
there
any
one
who
can
tell
how
the
trick
was
done
and
so
earn
the
ten
thousand
dollar
reward
asked
the
manager
he
had
made
this
announcement
many
times
seldom
of
late
had
any
one
come
forward
but
now
somewhat
to
the
surprise
of
joe
and
his
friends
a
man
voice
called
from
a
location
near
the
platform
i
can
tell
how
it
was
done
will
you
please
come
forward
invited
joe
now
taking
charge
of
the
proceedings
a
fairly
man
stepped
across
the
arena
and
approached
the
stage
joe
and
jim
tracy
and
the
others
vitally
interested
looked
closely
at
him
he
was
not
bill
carfax
that
was
certain
and
joe
did
not
know
the
man
nor
as
jim
tracy
admitted
afterward
did
he
you
say
you
can
tell
how
i
get
out
of
the
box
asked
joe
and
the
audience
listened
intently
yes
i
know
the
secret
are
you
willing
to
post
a
hundred
dollars
to
be
forfeited
to
the
red
cross
in
case
you
fail
went
on
the
young
magician
i
am
here
is
the
money
was
the
cool
response
this
quick
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
offer
rather
staggered
joe
but
he
had
no
fear
as
to
the
outcome
very
well
went
on
the
originator
of
the
box
trick
the
ringmaster
will
hold
your
money
if
you
are
successful
in
telling
how
i
get
out
of
the
box
the
cash
will
be
handed
back
to
you
and
you
will
receive
in
addition
a
check
for
ten
thousand
dollars
now
then
how
do
i
get
out
of
the
box
tell
the
audience
there
was
a
moment
of
suspense
and
then
the
man
with
an
air
of
confidence
stepped
close
to
the
big
heavy
box
and
pointing
to
a
certain
corner
said
right
there
is
a
secret
panel
you
slip
it
back
and
get
out
that
way
the
man
seemed
so
triumphantly
confident
and
so
sure
of
his
statement
that
several
in
the
audience
cried
is
that
right
is
that
how
you
do
the
trick
if
it
is
pay
him
the
ten
thousand
dollars
joe
looked
at
jim
tracy
this
was
the
first
time
any
one
had
ever
come
so
close
to
the
truth
helen
standing
at
one
side
of
the
stage
began
to
be
fearful
that
after
all
joe
secret
was
discovered
it
would
mean
an
end
of
the
box
trick
then
joe
smiled
and
stepped
forward
and
there
was
something
in
the
smile
that
reassured
helen
has
he
guessed
it
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
as
joe
passed
her
no
but
it
was
a
narrow
escape
was
the
answer
chapter
xix
juggling
with
fire
smilingly
the
man
who
had
made
claim
to
the
ten
thousand
dollars
waited
for
joe
strong
the
fellow
seemed
already
to
have
the
money
in
his
grasp
you
say
there
is
a
sliding
panel
in
that
corner
asked
joe
positive
and
that
i
get
out
that
way
yes
well
i
say
you
are
wrong
and
i
am
going
to
prove
it
returned
joe
easily
and
also
smiling
now
i
going
to
let
you
and
any
one
you
may
select
from
the
audience
paste
sheets
of
paper
over
that
corner
then
i
do
the
trick
over
again
if
i
get
out
of
the
box
and
the
paper
you
paste
on
remains
unbroken
you
have
to
admit
that
i
did
come
out
through
the
place
where
you
say
is
a
sliding
panel
wo
you
well
if
you
do
break
the
paper
i
guess
i
have
to
admit
you
did
get
out
that
way
said
the
man
with
a
grin
but
i
want
to
see
you
do
it
first
very
well
i
send
for
some
paste
and
paper
went
on
joe
meanwhile
call
upon
any
of
your
friends
you
like
to
help
come
on
up
here
bill
called
out
the
man
for
an
instant
joe
and
helen
also
as
she
admitted
later
feared
it
might
be
bill
carfax
to
whom
he
referred
but
an
altogether
different
individual
shuffled
up
to
the
stage
we
paste
paper
over
this
end
where
the
trick
panel
is
went
on
the
man
who
had
claimed
the
reward
he
wo
get
out
then
sure
he
wo
agreed
his
companion
do
we
get
the
ten
thousand
then
naturally
if
you
have
guessed
right
said
joe
but
that
remains
to
be
seen
there
was
no
trouble
in
getting
paste
and
paper
that
is
part
of
a
circus
for
even
though
it
is
paper
hoops
are
still
used
for
the
clowns
and
some
bareback
riders
to
leap
through
a
plentiful
supply
of
large
white
sheets
and
a
pail
of
paste
with
a
brush
were
brought
up
to
the
stage
then
the
men
were
invited
to
begin
their
work
which
was
to
seal
up
the
corner
the
man
had
picked
out
as
the
location
of
the
secret
panel
before
pasting
on
the
paper
the
men
looked
closely
at
the
joinings
of
the
box
they
seemed
rather
puzzled
in
spite
of
the
of
the
first
individual
the
pasting
was
not
a
work
of
art
but
it
was
effective
the
corner
of
the
box
was
plastered
over
with
sheets
of
white
paper
in
which
there
was
no
break
if
i
get
out
of
the
box
without
cracking
tearing
or
disturbing
the
paper
you
have
pasted
on
without
moving
it
in
any
way
you
admit
that
you
wrong
wo
you
asked
joe
as
he
prepared
to
do
the
trick
again
yes
was
the
answer
i
will
but
i
got
you
sewed
up
pasted
up
would
be
a
better
word
returned
joe
with
a
smile
but
that
remains
to
be
seen
the
box
was
placed
in
position
and
joe
took
his
place
in
it
the
lid
was
slammed
down
locked
and
the
rope
was
knotted
about
it
the
two
men
who
had
done
the
pasting
assisted
in
this
then
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
helen
and
the
firemen
took
their
places
there
was
a
period
of
waiting
the
tense
suspense
of
the
audience
was
manifest
even
jim
tracy
and
bill
watson
veteran
circus
men
though
they
were
seemed
a
bit
worried
the
man
who
had
claimed
the
ten
thousand
dollars
and
his
companion
seemed
a
bit
ill
at
ease
then
suddenly
the
curtains
parted
and
joe
strong
stood
in
plain
view
outside
the
box
bowing
to
the
applause
that
greeted
him
when
it
had
subsided
he
said
will
you
two
gentlemen
kindly
look
at
the
paper
seals
you
placed
on
one
corner
of
the
box
if
they
are
unbroken
and
undisturbed
i
take
it
you
have
lost
kindly
look
and
announce
what
you
find
the
men
shuffled
to
the
case
and
bent
down
over
the
corner
that
was
covered
with
the
pasted
sheets
look
as
they
did
they
could
find
no
evidences
of
a
break
or
tear
in
the
paper
and
it
had
not
been
removed
and
put
back
again
the
men
admitted
that
then
you
have
to
admit
that
i
did
get
out
of
the
box
by
means
of
a
secret
panel
in
that
corner
do
you
asked
joe
when
the
two
had
asserted
that
the
paper
was
intact
yes
i
guess
you
win
said
the
first
man
but
there
some
trick
about
it
oh
i
admit
that
laughed
joe
it
is
a
trick
and
if
you
discover
it
you
get
ten
thousand
dollars
but
not
red
cross
is
richer
by
a
hundred
dollars
um
grumbled
the
man
as
he
walked
off
and
many
in
the
audience
laughed
joe
had
won
the
circus
performance
went
on
to
its
usual
exciting
close
in
the
chariot
races
and
when
preparations
were
being
made
to
travel
on
to
the
next
city
helen
had
a
chance
to
speak
to
joe
it
was
a
narrow
escape
she
said
just
what
it
was
he
replied
if
he
had
picked
the
other
corner
the
left
instead
of
the
right
he
would
have
had
me
but
luck
was
with
us
i
glad
said
helen
but
how
did
he
happen
to
select
any
corner
some
one
must
know
more
about
your
trick
box
than
you
think
i
afraid
so
admitted
joe
ruefully
i
would
be
a
bit
surprised
but
what
this
was
some
of
the
work
of
bill
carfax
has
he
been
around
again
asked
helen
and
there
was
a
note
of
annoyance
in
her
voice
he
has
been
seen
said
joe
but
this
man
may
have
been
in
communication
with
him
bill
may
have
been
studying
the
trick
out
since
his
last
failure
and
i
must
admit
that
he
on
the
right
trail
that
is
if
it
was
bill
who
put
this
man
up
to
making
the
claim
what
makes
you
think
bill
had
anything
to
do
with
it
asked
helen
well
for
the
reason
that
this
is
just
the
kind
of
town
where
bill
would
be
likely
to
have
friends
i
mean
in
a
big
manufacturing
center
bill
may
have
found
a
man
who
is
willing
to
act
to
help
pull
down
the
reward
for
him
but
this
time
they
failed
he
may
succeed
next
time
remarked
helen
no
i
take
care
of
that
joe
said
i
going
to
make
a
change
in
the
box
as
the
mechanism
of
the
trick
box
has
been
explained
in
the
preceding
volume
it
will
not
be
repeated
here
suffice
it
to
say
that
method
of
getting
out
of
the
box
could
be
changed
so
that
if
a
person
thought
he
had
discovered
the
secret
panel
it
could
be
shifted
to
another
part
of
the
case
it
was
two
or
three
days
after
this
and
joe
had
made
a
change
in
his
box
which
satisfied
him
that
the
secret
would
not
soon
be
discovered
that
helen
coming
over
to
where
he
sat
in
his
private
tent
saw
him
making
what
seemed
to
be
torches
what
are
you
doing
she
asked
do
you
think
our
electric
lights
or
gasoline
flares
are
going
to
fail
she
went
on
jokingly
the
sampson
brothers
show
was
a
modern
one
and
carried
a
portable
electric
light
plant
oh
no
i
not
worrying
about
that
answered
joe
but
i
have
a
new
idea
for
my
wire
act
and
i
want
to
see
if
it
will
work
out
that
night
at
the
proper
time
when
joe
was
introduced
as
about
to
perform
his
wire
act
helen
noticed
ham
logan
come
out
with
the
young
carrying
a
number
of
the
torches
joe
had
made
joe
started
across
the
high
slack
wire
and
on
it
performed
many
of
his
usual
feats
they
were
not
specially
sensational
and
helen
wondered
what
he
had
planned
but
after
a
daring
run
across
the
slender
support
following
some
risky
side
swinging
helen
saw
joe
lower
from
the
high
platform
where
he
stood
a
flexible
wire
standing
on
the
ground
below
ham
logan
received
it
and
fastened
on
the
end
several
of
the
metal
torches
joe
had
made
the
young
magician
hauled
them
up
to
him
by
means
of
the
wire
then
as
helen
and
the
audience
watched
joe
set
the
torches
ablaze
they
were
made
of
hollow
cones
of
sheet
iron
in
which
were
placed
bits
of
tow
soaked
in
alcohol
with
four
blazing
torches
two
in
either
hand
joe
strong
started
out
to
cross
the
high
slack
wire
and
then
to
the
wonder
and
amazement
of
the
audience
no
less
than
that
of
his
friends
in
the
show
joe
began
juggling
with
fire
chapter
xx
the
blazing
banquet
across
the
wire
walked
the
young
performer
and
as
he
walked
he
tossed
into
the
air
catching
them
as
they
came
down
the
flaming
torches
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
fire
was
of
the
real
blazing
sort
and
hot
at
that
also
when
it
is
recalled
that
if
joe
happened
to
catch
hold
of
the
wrong
end
of
any
of
the
whirling
torches
and
when
it
is
evident
that
he
must
watch
his
step
it
will
be
seen
that
he
was
performing
no
easy
feat
yet
to
watch
him
one
would
have
thought
that
he
had
been
doing
it
right
along
for
many
performances
instead
of
this
being
his
first
in
public
though
he
and
ham
logan
had
practiced
in
private
across
the
wire
walked
joe
juggling
with
fire
and
when
he
reached
the
other
platform
he
walked
backward
along
the
swaying
wire
then
the
applause
broke
out
loud
and
long
the
crowd
appreciated
the
trick
with
all
its
dangers
true
joe
strong
was
an
expert
on
the
wire
and
he
was
also
a
good
juggler
but
juggling
with
torches
while
on
a
swaying
cable
was
not
as
easy
as
handling
harmless
rubber
balls
or
indian
clubs
and
the
circus
throng
seemed
to
appreciate
this
getting
back
to
the
platform
whence
he
had
started
joe
dropped
the
still
blazing
torches
into
a
tub
of
water
where
they
went
out
hissingly
this
provided
a
fitting
climax
to
the
act
as
showing
that
the
flames
were
real
ones
and
then
joe
donned
his
cap
of
leather
with
the
little
grooved
wheels
fastened
in
the
top
and
on
his
head
he
slid
down
the
slanting
wire
through
the
blazing
hoops
it
was
a
good
end
to
a
good
trick
and
the
crowd
went
wild
well
joe
you
sure
did
put
another
one
over
for
us
said
jim
tracy
at
the
conclusion
of
the
performance
that
fire
juggling
was
a
great
trick
that
the
sensation
you
promised
us
i
suppose
no
it
is
was
the
answer
i
not
ready
for
that
yet
but
glad
you
liked
the
trick
no
what
i
have
up
my
sleeve
is
something
even
better
i
think
well
i
hope
you
have
any
blazing
torches
up
your
sleeve
remarked
helen
with
a
laugh
you
need
a
new
coat
if
you
have
no
danger
laughed
joe
i
think
i
be
ready
soon
by
the
way
any
news
of
the
bogus
tickets
i
mean
the
detectives
have
found
out
anything
positive
have
they
not
yet
answered
moyne
who
had
joined
the
little
party
and
it
keeping
all
of
us
who
have
to
do
with
the
financial
end
guessing
as
to
where
the
trouble
will
break
out
next
it
is
an
unpleasant
state
of
affairs
agreed
joe
but
i
do
see
what
we
can
do
except
to
wait
you
have
noticed
any
more
of
the
counterfeit
tickets
of
late
have
you
no
answered
the
treasurer
it
only
when
we
hit
the
big
mill
cities
that
they
are
worked
in
on
us
that
why
i
believe
there
is
some
system
to
it
all
well
we
have
to
break
up
the
system
declared
joe
as
soon
as
i
get
this
new
act
of
mine
perfected
i
going
to
take
a
day
or
two
off
over
sunday
say
and
visit
the
detective
agency
they
may
need
stirring
up
i
wish
something
could
be
done
declared
the
treasurer
about
a
week
after
this
conversation
during
which
time
the
circus
had
moved
from
place
to
place
doing
good
business
watson
meeting
helen
on
the
lot
said
who
are
joe
new
friends
new
friends
i
did
know
he
had
any
specially
new
ones
remarked
the
young
bareback
rider
has
he
been
befriending
some
more
poor
circus
men
like
ham
logan
these
are
men
said
the
clown
wife
they
are
three
pretty
girls
i
saw
joe
coming
back
from
downtown
with
them
they
seemed
jolly
laughing
and
talking
three
pretty
girls
murmured
helen
and
then
she
quickly
added
with
an
air
of
indifference
oh
i
suppose
they
may
be
some
cousins
he
has
seen
for
a
long
while
i
thought
joe
said
he
had
no
relatives
in
this
country
went
on
watson
i
sure
i
do
know
and
helen
voice
was
very
cool
there
something
behind
all
this
mused
watson
as
helen
walked
away
i
hope
those
two
have
quarreled
maybe
i
should
have
said
anything
however
it
was
too
late
now
the
seeds
of
jealousy
seemed
to
have
been
sown
though
unwittingly
by
watson
helen
walked
on
with
her
head
high
in
the
air
and
as
the
clown
wife
passed
joe
official
tent
a
little
later
she
heard
issuing
from
it
the
jolly
laughter
and
talk
of
several
girlish
voices
i
wonder
what
joe
strong
is
up
to
thought
watson
he
never
acted
like
that
before
going
off
with
other
girls
and
neglecting
helen
i
going
to
speak
to
him
no
i
wo
either
she
decided
i
just
keep
still
until
i
know
i
can
help
it
better
that
way
it
was
perhaps
an
hour
after
this
that
joe
meeting
helen
called
to
her
oh
i
say
do
you
want
to
do
me
a
favor
what
sort
asked
the
rider
of
rosebud
and
if
joe
had
not
been
thinking
of
something
else
he
would
have
noticed
the
danger
signs
about
helen
countenance
the
fancy
jacket
i
use
in
one
of
my
tricks
is
torn
went
on
joe
would
it
be
asking
too
much
to
request
you
to
mend
it
helen
tossed
back
her
head
and
there
was
a
snap
to
her
eyes
as
she
answered
why
do
you
get
one
of
the
three
pretty
girls
to
do
your
mending
afraid
i
not
clever
enough
and
with
that
she
walked
on
haughtily
for
an
instant
joe
was
so
surprised
that
he
could
not
speak
his
face
plainly
showed
how
taken
aback
he
was
then
after
a
moment
he
managed
to
stammer
oh
but
i
say
helen
wait
a
moment
let
me
explain
i
er
i
i
only
but
helen
did
not
pause
she
did
not
look
back
and
she
did
not
answer
joe
stood
staring
after
her
in
blank
amazement
then
he
gave
utterance
to
a
low
whistle
and
exclaimed
oh
ho
i
see
well
it
will
be
my
turn
later
and
he
laughed
silently
he
either
playing
a
mean
trick
or
else
he
up
to
some
joke
declared
watson
who
from
a
distance
had
watched
this
little
scene
and
she
added
with
a
shake
of
her
head
i
ca
be
sure
what
it
is
young
folks
are
so
foolish
so
foolish
and
she
sighed
as
she
walked
away
joe
with
the
torn
jacket
in
his
hand
turned
back
toward
his
own
tent
and
presently
there
came
from
it
the
sounds
of
several
young
persons
including
girls
in
conversation
and
laughter
it
was
later
that
same
afternoon
when
helen
noticed
joe
in
one
part
of
the
big
tent
he
was
surrounded
by
three
pretty
young
ladies
and
three
young
men
they
were
on
one
of
the
platforms
seated
about
a
table
and
joe
seemed
to
be
entertaining
them
for
there
were
plates
cups
knives
and
forks
on
the
board
all
the
outward
indications
of
a
meal
the
time
was
late
afternoon
following
the
day
performance
and
prior
to
the
evening
show
helen
looked
curiously
over
at
the
gay
little
scene
and
something
tugged
at
her
then
she
looked
away
and
watson
observing
her
from
the
other
side
of
the
tent
shook
her
gray
head
i
ca
understand
joe
strong
murmured
the
clown
wife
what
has
come
over
him
it
was
just
before
the
opening
of
the
evening
performance
that
night
when
joe
meeting
helen
in
the
dressing
tent
said
i
sha
need
you
in
the
box
trick
nor
in
the
vanishing
lady
stunt
either
oh
i
suppose
you
going
to
use
one
of
the
new
pretty
girls
snapped
helen
joe
looked
at
her
quietly
no
he
said
i
am
not
but
i
am
not
going
to
put
on
either
trick
i
thought
you
like
to
know
so
if
you
want
to
introduce
any
of
your
extras
you
have
a
chance
thank
you
she
said
coldly
and
passed
on
joe
smiled
as
he
looked
after
her
with
a
blare
of
trumpets
a
boom
and
ruffle
of
drums
the
gay
procession
started
around
the
circus
arena
the
stately
elephants
the
hideous
camels
and
the
beautiful
horses
went
around
to
be
looked
at
wondered
at
and
admired
then
when
the
last
of
the
cavalcade
had
passed
out
the
various
acts
began
helen
had
a
new
costume
for
her
bareback
act
and
as
she
started
it
she
looked
over
to
where
joe
was
busy
on
his
stage
she
saw
the
young
men
and
women
around
him
they
wore
fancy
costumes
and
seemed
a
part
of
the
circus
helen
wondered
what
act
they
were
going
to
appear
in
since
none
including
them
had
been
announced
she
danced
about
on
the
back
of
rosebud
and
thought
bitterly
that
joe
had
never
noticed
her
new
dress
she
was
wearing
it
for
the
first
time
too
the
whistle
blew
all
acts
stopped
and
jim
tracy
advanced
toward
platform
a
most
marvelous
and
striking
act
he
cried
not
stating
what
it
was
to
be
all
eyes
even
those
of
helen
morton
turned
in
the
direction
of
joe
strong
he
acted
quickly
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
invited
the
three
pretty
girls
and
the
three
young
men
to
be
seated
they
took
their
places
around
a
table
with
joe
acting
as
host
the
table
appeared
to
be
well
laden
and
at
first
the
act
seemed
to
be
only
a
rather
elaborate
meal
being
served
in
public
what
is
it
all
about
mused
helen
i
ca
see
anything
very
wonderful
in
that
but
even
as
she
thus
mused
something
strange
happened
the
banquet
table
seemed
to
burst
into
flames
the
dishes
of
food
blazed
up
and
the
audience
gasped
but
the
young
men
the
young
women
and
joe
strong
did
not
seem
in
the
least
surprised
they
kept
their
seats
and
went
right
on
eating
and
then
with
a
thrill
of
surprise
it
was
noticed
that
joe
strong
and
his
guests
were
devouring
the
blazing
food
itself
the
girls
and
young
men
put
portion
after
portion
of
the
blazing
viands
into
their
mouths
chapter
xxi
ham
is
missing
surprise
and
astonishment
held
the
audience
silent
and
spellbound
for
a
moment
then
a
woman
screamed
and
ready
for
this
emergency
and
fearing
a
panic
than
which
nothing
is
more
dreaded
by
circus
men
jim
tracy
cried
sit
still
keep
your
seats
there
is
no
danger
this
is
all
part
of
the
show
we
are
merely
showing
you
how
to
eat
your
meals
in
case
any
of
you
ever
get
caught
in
a
blazing
volcano
watch
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
eat
their
stuff
hot
right
off
the
fire
there
was
a
laugh
at
this
sally
and
a
laugh
was
what
the
ringmaster
wanted
more
than
anything
else
just
then
he
knew
the
tide
of
fear
had
been
changed
to
one
of
wondering
admiration
and
so
sitting
on
the
stage
in
sight
of
the
thrilled
audience
joe
strong
and
his
guests
in
the
shape
of
pretty
girls
and
manly
young
fellows
fancifully
attired
continued
to
eat
the
blazing
food
the
very
pieces
of
bread
seemed
to
be
on
fire
there
was
a
dancing
flame
over
the
butter
and
each
bit
of
meat
or
other
food
joe
and
the
performers
lifted
on
their
forks
was
alive
with
leaping
fire
then
the
daring
feature
of
the
act
was
borne
home
to
the
audience
and
the
applause
broke
forth
applause
loud
and
long
there
were
yells
and
whistles
from
the
younger
and
more
enthusiastic
portion
of
the
circus
crowd
and
then
the
fires
died
away
the
table
seemed
emptied
of
victuals
and
the
young
men
and
women
imitating
joe
example
leaned
back
in
their
chairs
as
though
well
satisfied
with
their
hot
meal
there
you
are
ladies
and
gentlemen
declaimed
the
ringmaster
they
have
come
to
no
harm
from
eating
living
fire
if
any
of
you
are
tired
of
cold
victuals
kindly
step
forward
and
you
will
be
treated
to
a
free
hot
lunch
by
professor
strong
not
any
in
mine
thank
you
murmured
a
man
and
that
seemed
to
be
the
general
opinion
as
joe
and
his
new
associates
arose
to
bow
to
the
renewed
applause
the
ringmaster
made
an
announcement
a
blazing
banquet
such
as
you
have
just
witnessed
will
take
place
at
each
and
every
performance
he
declared
come
and
bring
your
friends
nothing
like
it
ever
seen
before
on
any
stage
or
in
any
circus
in
the
world
remember
you
will
see
the
same
and
identical
act
at
each
and
every
performance
and
all
for
the
price
of
one
admission
professor
strong
and
his
gifted
salamander
associates
will
eat
fire
as
they
did
just
now
at
each
and
every
show
in
the
big
tent
i
thank
you
well
joe
it
went
all
right
said
jim
tracy
when
the
performers
had
left
the
stage
and
the
young
was
alone
on
the
platform
it
went
like
a
house
afire
yes
said
joe
it
seemed
to
i
guess
it
went
better
than
if
we
had
made
a
lot
of
preliminary
notices
the
suddenness
of
it
took
them
by
surprise
but
we
can
advertise
it
big
now
said
the
ringmaster
we
do
need
to
specify
exactly
what
it
is
of
course
those
who
have
seen
it
will
tell
their
friends
who
are
coming
and
who
have
seen
it
but
the
big
majority
of
the
audiences
will
be
as
much
surprised
as
this
one
was
it
went
big
yes
agreed
joe
it
did
and
i
glad
of
it
this
is
the
sensation
i
was
planning
but
i
did
want
to
go
into
details
until
i
was
sure
it
would
work
i
had
to
engage
my
helpers
in
the
dark
so
to
speak
and
i
did
even
tell
you
what
i
was
planning
until
the
last
minute
no
you
did
said
jim
helen
morton
came
slowly
across
the
arena
her
act
was
over
and
she
had
seen
the
blazing
banquet
and
joe
part
in
it
her
cheeks
were
unusually
red
as
she
approached
holding
out
her
hand
and
there
was
a
rather
misty
look
about
her
eyes
as
she
said
will
you
forgive
me
joe
for
what
he
asked
tantalizingly
oh
you
know
perfectly
well
she
exclaimed
it
was
very
silly
of
me
but
i
know
helen
i
did
tease
you
a
bit
he
said
i
suppose
i
might
have
told
you
that
the
pretty
girls
were
those
i
had
engaged
to
help
in
the
banquet
scene
together
with
the
young
fellows
we
had
only
a
few
rehearsals
in
my
tent
and
i
did
want
to
spread
the
news
too
generally
even
among
the
circus
crowd
for
fear
of
a
leak
but
i
suppose
i
might
have
told
you
it
would
have
saved
me
from
acting
so
silly
if
you
had
she
murmured
then
it
is
i
who
should
ask
forgiveness
said
joe
but
it
all
right
now
and
may
i
come
to
lunch
with
you
or
would
you
rather
that
i
should
go
with
one
of
the
pretty
girls
if
you
do
i
never
forgive
you
declared
helen
blushing
more
than
ever
and
so
the
little
quarrel
ended
as
joe
had
intimated
he
had
engaged
his
banquet
helpers
secretly
and
they
had
met
him
at
the
city
where
the
circus
was
to
remain
three
days
and
nights
ham
logan
had
been
instrumental
in
getting
the
performers
for
joe
since
the
old
circus
man
knew
the
best
theatrical
agency
at
which
to
apply
so
joe
had
hired
the
young
men
and
women
to
act
the
part
of
guests
at
the
banquet
he
had
guessed
that
helen
actions
denoted
her
jealousy
but
he
could
not
forbear
teasing
her
but
did
they
actually
eat
the
fire
helen
asked
when
she
and
joe
were
together
again
of
course
i
know
they
did
she
went
on
it
silly
of
me
to
ask
such
a
question
but
it
was
very
realistic
i
glad
of
that
said
joe
no
they
did
actually
the
fire
any
more
than
i
eat
it
and
i
may
say
that
i
had
quite
a
little
trouble
in
getting
them
to
put
it
near
enough
their
mouths
to
make
it
seem
as
if
they
did
but
the
was
only
very
thin
paper
of
a
peculiar
kind
which
ham
logan
and
i
worked
out
together
it
can
be
made
to
look
like
almost
any
food
and
yet
it
is
treated
chemically
so
as
to
burn
easily
and
quickly
the
flames
go
out
as
soon
as
they
come
near
enough
our
mouths
to
feel
the
effects
of
certain
chemicals
that
are
on
our
faces
i
ca
tell
you
all
the
secrets
but
that
is
enough
to
show
you
how
we
worked
it
there
was
no
more
danger
than
there
is
when
i
fire
and
the
trick
is
done
in
much
the
same
way
ham
logan
is
getting
to
be
an
invaluable
helper
i
hope
he
stays
with
me
i
never
could
have
done
this
trick
without
him
the
blazing
banquet
was
the
talk
of
that
and
other
cities
as
jim
tracy
had
said
the
feat
was
shown
at
each
and
every
performance
joe
cutting
out
some
of
his
less
sensational
acts
the
circus
made
a
longer
stay
than
usual
in
the
city
where
the
fiery
food
was
first
eaten
and
played
to
business
and
the
best
of
it
is
that
we
have
seen
a
bogus
ticket
said
the
treasurer
much
elated
joe
as
one
of
the
chief
owners
of
the
circus
was
able
to
hire
the
unknown
to
any
of
his
associates
until
the
last
minute
and
thus
the
surprise
was
all
the
greater
joe
fire
tricks
were
now
the
talk
of
the
theatrical
and
circus
worlds
and
he
received
many
offers
to
leave
sampson
brothers
show
and
star
by
himself
but
he
refused
them
all
saying
he
wanted
to
build
up
his
own
show
to
a
point
never
before
reached
as
he
had
said
ham
logan
proved
a
valuable
helper
the
man
a
of
the
old
school
knew
many
valuable
secrets
and
he
held
himself
under
such
obligation
to
joe
that
he
revealed
many
of
them
to
the
young
magician
have
you
learned
anything
more
about
who
left
that
bottle
of
powerful
acid
in
among
my
things
asked
joe
of
ham
one
afternoon
when
the
fire
banquet
had
been
unusually
successful
no
not
exactly
was
the
answer
but
i
on
the
trail
i
think
i
am
working
along
the
right
lines
but
it
is
too
early
to
make
any
statement
well
take
your
time
said
joe
only
i
do
want
to
get
mixed
up
with
any
of
the
deadly
stuff
do
worry
i
on
the
watch
declared
the
old
performer
that
night
when
the
time
for
joe
to
prepare
for
his
acts
including
the
fire
tricks
came
he
did
not
see
ham
in
the
dressing
tent
where
the
assistant
was
usually
to
be
found
have
you
seen
him
asked
joe
of
harry
loper
yes
about
half
an
hour
ago
was
the
answer
he
said
he
was
going
in
to
town
going
in
to
town
and
so
near
performing
time
cried
joe
i
wonder
what
for
he
ought
to
be
here
joe
was
worried
and
when
his
signal
for
going
on
came
ham
logan
was
still
missing
joe
strong
shook
his
head
dubiously
it
had
been
found
necessary
to
get
another
man
to
help
with
the
act
i
do
like
this
he
murmured
i
do
like
it
for
a
cent
chapter
xxii
a
sudden
warning
only
the
fact
that
he
had
strong
nerves
and
that
he
possessed
the
ability
of
concentrating
his
mind
on
whatever
was
uppermost
at
the
time
enabled
the
young
circus
man
to
get
through
his
various
circus
acts
with
credit
at
that
performance
he
began
with
the
worry
over
ham
disappearance
before
him
and
he
was
actually
worried
a
bad
state
of
affairs
for
one
whose
ability
to
please
and
deceive
critical
audiences
depends
on
his
snappy
acting
his
quickness
of
hand
and
mind
and
his
skill
but
as
has
been
said
joe
possessed
the
ability
to
concentrate
on
the
most
needful
matter
and
that
for
the
time
being
was
his
box
trick
his
and
his
slide
on
his
head
down
the
slanting
wire
through
the
blazing
hoops
then
came
the
blazing
banquet
and
this
created
the
usual
furor
in
the
audience
joe
managed
to
get
through
it
with
credit
though
his
rather
strange
manner
was
noticed
and
commented
on
afterward
by
the
young
people
associated
with
him
i
wonder
what
bothering
the
boss
asked
one
of
the
young
of
another
he
nearly
made
a
slip
when
he
was
lifting
up
that
fake
fried
oyster
maybe
the
circus
is
losing
money
and
he
got
to
cut
out
this
act
let
some
of
us
go
ca
pay
our
salaries
was
the
reply
do
you
believe
it
declared
the
other
the
circus
is
making
more
money
than
it
ever
did
more
even
when
the
fake
tickets
are
worked
off
on
it
well
it
none
of
our
affair
i
would
like
my
salary
to
be
cut
off
oh
neither
would
i
fake
tickets
i
had
heard
of
them
oh
yes
explained
the
first
speaker
and
he
went
into
the
details
of
the
affair
but
there
surely
something
worrying
the
boss
commented
still
another
of
the
young
men
and
his
associates
including
the
pretty
girls
agreed
with
him
and
what
really
was
worrying
joe
was
speculation
over
the
fate
of
ham
logan
not
since
joe
had
first
taken
the
old
and
broken
circus
actor
into
his
employ
had
ham
been
away
more
than
a
few
hours
at
a
time
and
then
joe
knew
where
he
was
this
time
ham
had
left
no
word
save
the
uncertain
one
that
he
was
going
into
the
city
on
the
outskirts
of
which
the
circus
was
at
the
time
showing
but
do
you
think
he
come
back
asked
jim
tracy
when
after
the
performance
joe
had
spoken
of
the
missing
ham
i
wish
i
could
think
so
was
the
reply
i
sure
will
hate
to
lose
him
i
depend
a
lot
on
him
in
my
fire
tricks
what
makes
you
think
you
will
lose
him
asked
tracy
curiously
well
his
going
off
this
way
for
one
declared
joe
what
i
really
afraid
of
is
that
he
may
have
gone
back
to
his
bad
habits
you
know
how
it
is
a
man
starts
to
reform
and
he
keeps
the
pledges
he
makes
until
he
meets
some
of
his
boon
companions
who
used
to
help
him
on
the
downward
road
they
invite
him
to
come
along
for
a
good
time
and
he
goes
and
you
think
that
what
happened
to
ham
i
afraid
so
i
going
down
town
and
see
if
i
can
get
any
trace
of
him
and
this
joe
did
as
soon
as
he
was
relieved
of
his
duties
in
the
circus
the
show
was
to
remain
in
town
over
night
and
this
gave
him
just
the
chance
he
wanted
it
was
an
unpleasant
errand
but
joe
went
through
with
it
he
had
to
call
at
many
places
that
were
distasteful
to
him
but
in
none
of
them
did
he
get
a
trace
of
ham
logan
joe
saw
in
the
more
brilliant
parts
of
the
city
a
number
of
the
circus
men
including
some
of
the
chief
performers
they
were
taking
advantage
of
the
stay
and
were
meeting
old
friends
and
making
some
new
acquaintances
of
these
joe
inquired
for
news
of
ham
but
no
one
had
seen
him
the
old
had
endeared
himself
to
more
than
one
member
of
the
sampson
brothers
show
for
he
was
always
ready
to
do
a
favor
so
more
than
joe
were
interested
in
seeing
that
ham
kept
on
the
good
road
along
which
he
had
started
but
all
of
joe
efforts
were
of
no
avail
it
was
after
midnight
when
he
ended
his
search
and
rather
than
go
back
to
the
sleeping
car
where
the
other
performers
spent
their
night
joe
put
up
at
a
hotel
sending
word
to
jim
tracy
of
what
he
intended
to
do
i
want
to
find
ham
joe
wrote
in
the
note
he
sent
to
the
ringmaster
by
a
messenger
boy
and
i
asked
the
police
to
be
on
the
quiet
lookout
for
him
if
i
stay
at
the
hotel
i
can
help
him
more
quickly
in
case
he
found
than
if
i
am
away
out
at
the
railroad
siding
where
the
circus
train
is
i
see
you
in
the
morning
but
joe
night
at
the
hotel
was
spent
in
vain
for
there
was
no
word
of
ham
logan
and
the
morning
which
joe
put
in
making
inquiries
was
equally
fruitless
i
guess
ham
is
gone
for
good
sighed
joe
and
his
regret
was
genuine
and
almost
as
much
for
the
sake
of
the
man
himself
as
for
his
own
loss
of
a
good
assistant
for
ham
logan
was
that
and
more
to
joe
the
former
tramp
had
much
valuable
information
regarding
the
old
style
tricks
and
though
he
was
not
up
to
the
task
of
doing
them
himself
he
gave
joe
good
advice
it
was
by
his
help
and
advice
that
joe
had
staged
the
blazing
banquet
scene
which
was
such
a
success
and
which
the
newspapers
mentioned
constantly
true
joe
did
not
actually
need
ham
to
go
on
with
his
acts
he
could
break
in
another
man
to
help
him
to
hand
him
the
proper
article
at
just
the
right
time
to
see
to
the
mixing
of
the
chemicals
and
to
the
preparation
of
the
viands
that
seemed
to
be
composed
of
fire
itself
and
that
what
i
have
to
do
mused
joe
when
he
became
convinced
some
days
later
that
ham
was
not
to
be
found
he
wished
that
helen
was
able
to
act
as
his
assistant
in
the
fire
scenes
as
she
did
in
the
box
trick
and
the
vanishing
lady
act
but
she
could
spare
no
more
time
from
her
own
act
with
rosebud
since
she
was
billed
as
one
of
the
stars
then
too
helen
had
a
fear
of
fire
and
though
she
had
succeeded
in
overcoming
part
of
it
still
she
would
not
have
made
the
proper
sort
of
assistant
in
those
acts
besides
she
would
not
have
been
able
to
mix
the
chemicals
joe
required
to
render
himself
immune
from
such
fire
as
he
actually
came
in
contact
with
though
momentarily
i
got
to
train
in
a
new
man
decided
joe
he
mentally
considered
various
circus
employees
rejecting
one
after
another
and
finally
selected
one
of
the
young
men
who
acted
in
the
blazing
banquet
scene
this
youth
was
a
bright
manly
fellow
and
had
introduced
some
new
business
in
the
act
which
made
it
more
interesting
i
train
him
in
decided
joe
with
the
understanding
that
if
ham
comes
back
he
get
his
old
place
if
he
comes
back
i
wonder
if
he
ever
will
and
if
he
be
in
a
condition
to
help
me
joe
shook
his
head
dubiously
the
circus
moved
on
it
had
played
to
good
business
and
there
was
more
good
business
in
prospect
moyne
the
treasurer
was
on
the
anxious
seat
much
of
the
time
fearing
another
flood
of
bogus
tickets
but
the
efforts
mentioned
on
the
part
of
the
swindlers
following
the
use
of
new
paper
was
all
they
had
to
complain
of
so
far
either
the
detectives
are
too
close
to
the
trail
of
the
cheats
to
allow
them
to
work
in
safety
or
they
given
it
up
altogether
decided
the
treasurer
i
hope
so
said
joe
still
it
wo
do
to
relax
our
vigilance
i
wrote
to
the
detective
firm
as
i
said
i
would
jacking
them
up
a
bit
maybe
they
are
ready
to
make
an
arrest
and
that
would
stop
the
swindlers
the
young
man
joe
had
picked
out
to
act
as
his
chief
assistant
in
the
fire
scenes
was
ted
brown
ted
was
about
eighteen
years
old
and
this
was
his
first
position
with
a
circus
but
he
was
making
good
and
he
had
not
yet
been
afflicted
with
the
terrible
disease
known
as
swelled
head
something
which
ruins
so
many
performers
ted
learned
rapidly
and
joe
felt
that
it
would
be
safe
to
trust
him
with
some
of
the
secrets
of
the
tricks
the
mixing
of
the
chemicals
and
the
like
joe
choice
seemed
to
be
a
good
one
for
ted
did
well
and
his
part
in
the
banquet
scene
was
made
even
better
by
his
knowledge
of
the
inner
workings
of
the
material
used
but
though
joe
did
not
lose
materially
by
the
desertion
of
ham
if
that
was
what
it
was
since
he
could
now
depend
on
ted
the
young
circus
man
many
times
found
himself
wondering
if
he
would
ever
see
the
old
again
the
circus
opened
one
afternoon
in
a
large
city
one
in
which
lived
many
thousands
of
men
employed
in
a
large
plant
there
be
big
crowds
here
said
moyne
as
he
walked
toward
the
ticket
wagon
in
preparation
for
the
rush
and
it
here
we
have
to
look
out
for
bogus
coupons
why
asked
joe
who
was
getting
ready
for
his
acts
because
in
every
other
case
the
swindlers
have
worked
their
game
where
there
was
a
big
plant
engaging
many
men
of
what
you
might
call
rough
and
ready
character
ready
to
take
a
chance
on
scalped
admission
tickets
and
rough
enough
to
fight
if
they
were
discovered
so
i
going
to
be
on
the
watch
it
just
as
well
to
be
decided
joe
he
turned
back
into
the
tent
which
was
his
combined
dressing
room
and
a
storage
place
for
his
various
smaller
bits
of
apparatus
and
the
chemicals
he
used
in
his
fire
act
before
giving
his
last
act
joe
always
washed
his
hands
and
face
and
rinsed
his
mouth
out
with
a
chemical
preparation
that
would
for
a
time
resist
the
action
of
fire
it
was
a
secret
compound
rather
difficult
to
handle
and
make
and
joe
had
taught
ted
brown
how
to
do
it
the
young
fellow
was
handing
joe
this
mixture
some
of
which
was
also
used
by
all
who
took
part
in
the
blazing
banquet
scene
when
the
flap
of
the
tent
was
suddenly
pushed
aside
and
harry
loper
entered
stop
he
cried
raising
a
restraining
hand
do
use
that
solution
strong
it
doped
do
use
it
joe
who
had
been
about
to
apply
some
of
the
stuff
to
his
hands
turned
in
surprise
he
was
alarmed
at
the
strange
look
on
the
face
of
the
youth
who
acted
as
his
helper
in
the
high
wire
and
in
some
of
the
trapeze
acts
do
use
that
stuff
cried
harry
it
doped
and
then
he
sank
down
on
a
chair
and
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
burst
into
tears
chapter
xxiii
a
strange
summons
joe
strong
looked
from
the
sobbing
harry
loper
to
the
amazed
ted
brown
the
latter
face
showed
his
great
surprise
for
an
instant
joe
had
an
ugly
suspicion
that
his
new
assistant
had
played
him
false
that
because
of
jealousy
or
from
some
other
motive
he
had
mixed
the
chemicals
in
some
way
to
make
them
ineffective
this
would
spoil
the
illusion
or
it
might
even
cause
injury
look
here
harry
what
the
matter
cried
joe
purposely
using
a
rough
voice
so
as
to
stop
if
possible
the
display
of
emotion
on
the
part
of
the
youth
act
like
a
man
ca
you
if
you
done
some
mean
trick
tell
me
about
it
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
this
mixture
is
doped
just
that
exclaimed
harry
looking
up
with
haggard
face
i
stand
it
any
longer
i
promised
not
to
tell
but
i
got
to
i
i
see
any
harm
come
to
you
harm
cried
joe
do
you
mean
this
is
poison
no
not
that
he
said
it
would
do
you
any
harm
that
it
would
only
make
the
act
turn
out
wrong
that
you
nor
anybody
would
not
be
hurt
but
i
do
believe
him
i
believe
he
wants
to
harm
you
and
i
going
to
tell
all
i
know
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
look
here
harry
said
joe
sternly
are
you
perfectly
sober
do
you
know
what
you
saying
yes
i
know
that
all
right
strong
whined
the
lad
i
wo
say
i
have
been
drinking
for
i
have
i
did
it
to
try
to
forget
but
it
would
work
i
plenty
sober
enough
to
know
what
i
saying
and
you
tell
me
this
chemical
preparation
will
work
harm
to
me
and
those
who
help
me
in
the
fire
acts
i
do
know
as
to
that
strong
he
told
me
that
it
would
harm
you
but
i
do
believe
him
i
wo
trust
him
any
more
who
do
you
mean
asked
joe
do
you
know
anything
about
this
he
demanded
sternly
of
ted
brown
you
prepared
this
mixture
did
you
yes
strong
i
did
i
made
it
just
the
way
you
told
me
if
you
think
no
he
does
know
anything
about
it
murmured
harry
who
seemed
to
have
recovered
some
of
his
composure
now
that
the
worst
of
his
confession
was
over
he
did
have
a
hand
in
it
i
to
blame
if
i
had
let
him
into
your
tent
he
could
have
doped
the
stuff
oh
sorry
i
was
a
fool
to
believe
him
but
he
promised
me
a
lot
of
money
just
to
keep
still
and
i
done
it
up
to
now
but
i
through
with
him
look
here
cried
joe
how
long
has
this
been
going
on
was
this
mixture
ever
doped
as
you
call
it
before
oh
no
not
that
i
know
was
the
answer
joe
knew
this
much
at
least
was
true
the
mixture
had
always
worked
perfectly
before
and
if
it
had
been
tampered
with
that
would
not
have
been
the
case
then
what
do
you
mean
cried
the
young
magician
speak
up
ca
you
be
a
man
if
you
have
done
anything
really
wrong
you
wo
be
punished
i
after
the
person
back
of
you
speak
up
who
is
he
he
realized
that
harry
loper
was
but
a
weak
tool
in
the
hands
of
some
one
else
and
many
things
that
had
seemed
strange
came
back
to
joe
with
a
sudden
rush
now
he
might
be
able
to
learn
who
it
was
that
had
such
enmity
against
him
and
the
circus
are
you
going
to
tell
me
demanded
joe
yes
yes
i
tell
you
everything
was
the
answer
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
i
ca
eat
in
comfort
any
more
and
i
ca
sleep
first
he
promised
to
pay
me
for
letting
him
come
to
your
tent
when
you
were
out
then
he
threatened
to
kill
me
if
i
told
but
i
going
to
tell
i
care
what
he
does
but
if
this
is
the
first
time
my
chemical
mixture
has
been
doped
what
do
you
mean
about
whoever
he
is
coming
to
my
tent
at
other
times
asked
joe
what
other
times
were
they
do
you
remember
when
the
bottle
of
acid
was
found
asked
the
abashed
youth
yes
was
that
some
of
your
doings
too
cried
joe
hotly
no
i
did
do
it
he
did
but
i
i
looked
the
other
way
when
he
did
it
and
then
there
was
the
time
when
the
trapeze
wire
broke
it
was
acid
that
did
that
he
put
it
on
who
is
this
mysterious
person
you
call
all
the
while
asked
joe
i
want
to
get
after
him
i
tell
you
promised
harry
but
you
protect
me
wo
you
mr
strong
as
far
as
i
can
with
decency
yes
now
tell
me
but
there
came
another
interruption
a
man
thrust
his
head
into
the
tent
and
exclaimed
tracy
wants
to
know
if
you
can
advance
the
fire
scenes
about
ten
minutes
strong
one
of
the
men
acrobats
has
sprained
his
wrist
and
they
got
to
cut
out
his
act
can
you
go
on
ten
minutes
sooner
than
usual
guess
i
have
to
said
joe
quick
ted
make
up
some
new
solution
i
help
you
as
for
you
harry
you
stay
right
here
i
talk
to
you
later
have
time
now
and
i
going
to
have
some
one
stay
with
you
to
make
sure
you
do
weaken
and
run
away
it
is
as
much
for
your
own
sake
as
mine
if
you
decided
to
leave
the
man
who
got
you
to
help
in
this
work
i
stand
by
you
but
i
want
to
be
sure
your
repentance
is
genuine
so
stay
right
here
and
we
talk
about
this
later
do
say
anything
outside
he
cautioned
ted
i
wo
was
the
answer
say
i
hope
you
do
think
i
had
any
hand
in
this
no
joe
answered
i
do
i
trusting
you
that
my
best
evidence
thank
you
said
the
young
fellow
and
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
quick
work
was
needed
on
the
part
of
joe
and
his
new
helper
to
get
ready
for
the
act
new
chemicals
had
to
be
mixed
to
render
it
safe
to
handle
fire
this
was
in
the
acts
where
joe
seemed
to
swallow
flames
and
where
he
and
the
others
dined
on
blazing
food
in
the
other
acts
where
joe
juggled
on
the
slack
wire
with
the
flaming
torches
where
he
slid
down
the
wire
through
the
blazing
hoops
and
where
he
jumped
into
the
tank
of
water
with
his
garments
apparently
in
flames
no
change
was
needed
in
these
feats
joe
costume
was
fireproofed
and
as
they
had
been
treated
some
time
before
he
knew
there
was
only
a
remote
possibility
that
they
had
been
tampered
with
still
he
was
taking
no
chances
and
while
he
was
waiting
for
ted
to
complete
the
mixing
of
the
chemical
mixture
joe
tested
his
garments
with
a
blazing
bit
of
paper
they
did
not
catch
fire
which
assured
him
of
safety
during
his
sensational
acts
how
about
you
joe
asked
jim
tracy
thrusting
his
head
into
the
tent
a
little
later
are
you
going
to
be
able
to
make
it
oh
sure
i
be
there
sorry
to
have
to
make
the
change
went
on
the
ringmaster
but
baraldi
is
hurt
and
his
act
had
to
be
cut
out
completely
so
i
had
to
move
you
up
oh
that
all
right
joe
assured
him
hello
what
are
you
doing
here
and
what
the
matter
with
you
cried
jim
seeing
harry
loper
sitting
dejectedly
in
a
chair
why
are
you
out
fixing
the
trapezes
you
know
strong
goes
on
them
soon
i
i
he
told
me
to
stay
here
loper
stammered
indicating
joe
yes
supplemented
joe
strong
there
something
doing
jim
i
tell
you
later
i
want
some
one
to
stay
in
here
with
harry
some
one
we
can
trust
he
added
significantly
i
send
paddy
flynn
promised
the
ringmaster
as
he
went
out
he
looked
curiously
at
harry
how
the
stuff
coming
on
ted
asked
joe
when
the
doctored
mixture
had
been
thrown
away
and
new
made
all
right
i
guess
i
try
it
he
put
some
on
one
finger
thrust
the
member
into
the
flame
of
a
candle
and
held
it
there
longer
than
usual
look
out
joe
warned
him
you
ca
be
too
familiar
with
fire
the
stuff
all
right
was
the
answer
it
better
than
the
last
we
used
good
well
let
get
busy
in
spite
of
the
strain
of
what
he
had
gone
through
in
listening
to
the
partial
confession
of
harry
loper
joe
did
some
of
his
best
work
in
the
fire
acts
that
day
the
blazing
banquet
was
most
effective
having
changed
to
his
costume
for
his
magical
box
and
other
tricks
and
learning
that
harry
was
still
safe
under
the
watchful
eye
of
paddy
flynn
joe
hurried
out
to
his
stage
where
tracy
was
already
making
the
ten
thousand
dollar
offer
as
joe
hurried
across
the
arena
one
of
the
tent
men
thrust
into
his
hand
a
scrap
of
paper
what
is
it
asked
joe
i
do
know
was
the
reply
a
boy
just
brought
it
and
told
me
to
give
it
to
you
joe
had
a
half
minute
to
wait
while
the
ringmaster
was
talking
quickly
he
read
the
note
it
was
really
a
scrawl
but
it
said
please
forgive
me
and
still
believe
in
me
i
am
suffering
i
ca
come
to
you
in
the
condition
i
in
now
but
i
have
something
to
tell
you
if
you
could
come
to
me
the
boy
will
bring
you
the
note
was
signed
hamilton
logan
whew
whistled
joe
worse
and
more
of
it
chapter
xxiv
the
trap
is
set
pausing
only
long
enough
to
tell
the
man
who
had
given
him
the
note
to
be
sure
and
detain
the
boy
who
had
brought
it
joe
strong
hurried
over
to
the
stage
to
begin
his
box
trick
that
was
to
be
followed
by
the
disappearing
lady
act
and
here
again
joe
had
to
use
all
his
reserve
nerve
to
enable
him
to
go
on
with
the
performance
as
smoothly
as
he
usually
did
he
had
to
dismiss
from
his
mind
for
the
time
being
all
thoughts
of
ham
logan
and
he
steeled
himself
not
to
think
of
what
the
strange
summons
might
mean
if
ham
is
in
trouble
i
going
to
help
him
that
all
declared
joe
following
the
usual
announcement
by
jim
tracy
joe
got
into
the
box
it
was
locked
and
roped
and
then
helen
took
her
place
as
did
the
fireman
with
his
gleaming
ax
joe
worked
unusually
quickly
that
night
in
getting
out
of
the
box
he
knew
this
haste
would
not
spoil
the
illusion
of
the
trick
in
fact
it
really
heightened
it
for
he
was
out
of
the
heavy
box
in
much
shorter
time
than
it
had
taken
the
volunteer
committee
to
lock
him
in
and
joe
was
glad
no
one
came
forward
at
this
performance
to
claim
the
ten
thousand
dollars
that
would
have
taken
up
time
and
time
just
then
was
what
joe
wanted
most
evidently
none
of
you
know
how
the
trick
is
done
commented
the
ringmaster
when
his
offer
of
ten
thousand
dollars
was
not
taken
advantage
of
we
will
now
proceed
to
the
next
illusion
that
of
causing
a
beautiful
lady
to
disappear
and
vanish
into
thin
air
before
your
very
eyes
there
is
no
reward
offered
for
the
solution
of
this
mystery
helen
then
took
her
place
on
the
trick
chair
over
the
trap
in
the
stage
the
silk
shawl
was
placed
over
her
and
in
due
time
the
chair
was
shown
empty
the
usual
applause
followed
and
joe
was
glad
his
acts
were
over
for
the
time
bowing
to
acknowledge
the
fervor
of
the
audience
joe
started
toward
his
dressing
apartment
i
want
to
see
you
as
soon
as
i
can
he
quickly
told
helen
but
i
have
to
go
away
it
about
ham
he
added
i
heard
from
him
where
is
he
i
do
know
just
a
scrawled
note
the
messenger
who
brought
it
is
going
to
take
me
to
him
oh
joe
i
so
glad
you
heard
from
him
i
liked
him
i
did
too
i
hope
i
can
continue
to
like
him
but
i
afraid
from
the
tone
of
his
note
that
he
broken
his
pledge
however
we
ca
expect
too
much
do
go
away
for
an
hour
or
so
i
be
back
as
soon
as
i
can
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
i
wait
for
you
promised
helen
as
joe
hurried
across
the
arena
he
saw
the
tent
man
who
had
given
him
the
note
where
the
boy
he
asked
i
took
him
to
your
tent
paddy
flynn
is
there
and
loper
is
anything
the
matter
mr
strong
oh
nothing
that
ca
be
made
right
i
hope
joe
found
a
boy
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
folding
chair
in
the
dressing
tent
the
lad
was
looking
wonderingly
about
the
place
did
you
bring
this
note
asked
joe
showing
the
crumpled
paper
sure
i
did
and
say
i
wish
i
could
see
the
show
you
can
after
you
take
me
to
logan
replied
joe
you
know
where
he
is
do
you
sure
i
do
did
he
give
me
the
note
to
bring
youse
where
is
he
down
in
kelly
joint
i
live
next
door
what
is
kelly
joint
a
saloon
answered
the
boy
de
name
on
de
winders
is
café
but
they
do
pronounce
it
that
way
anyhow
some
of
do
it
oughter
be
cave
i
guess
it
sure
is
a
joint
is
logan
there
asked
joe
sure
he
is
upstairs
in
one
of
de
rooms
he
been
on
a
terrible
spree
he
said
but
he
sober
now
and
sick
gee
mister
but
he
sure
was
sick
me
mudder
helped
take
care
of
him
i
glad
of
that
said
joe
we
go
to
him
at
once
where
is
kelly
er
café
down
by
de
river
near
de
shipyards
answered
the
lad
for
an
instant
joe
hesitated
but
only
for
an
instant
the
district
named
as
he
well
knew
was
a
bad
one
it
was
also
dangerous
but
it
was
still
afternoon
though
growing
late
it
would
not
be
dark
for
some
time
however
and
joe
felt
that
he
would
be
safe
enough
in
going
alone
at
night
he
would
have
taken
some
one
with
him
but
there
were
two
reasons
why
he
did
not
want
to
do
this
now
one
was
that
no
one
whom
he
felt
he
could
trust
to
be
discreet
could
be
taken
away
from
the
circus
which
was
not
yet
over
though
joe
acts
were
finished
another
reason
was
that
he
did
not
want
the
possible
degradation
of
logan
seen
by
any
of
his
former
associates
possibly
he
might
come
back
to
the
show
and
he
would
always
have
a
feeling
of
shame
if
he
knew
that
those
with
whom
he
worked
had
seen
him
recovering
from
a
spree
as
the
lad
called
it
i
got
to
go
away
said
joe
to
paddy
flynn
joe
and
the
lad
had
talked
at
one
side
of
the
tent
and
in
low
tones
so
the
young
circus
man
knew
their
voices
had
not
been
overheard
by
paddy
and
the
man
he
was
guarding
harry
loper
i
be
back
as
soon
as
i
can
went
on
the
young
meanwhile
you
stay
here
loper
paddy
will
take
care
of
you
and
when
i
come
back
i
have
a
talk
with
you
all
right
assented
the
other
wearily
i
feel
better
now
i
told
you
joe
and
micky
donlon
which
the
boy
said
was
his
name
though
probably
michael
was
what
he
had
been
christened
were
soon
on
their
way
toward
the
river
and
the
location
of
one
of
the
shipyards
are
youse
sure
i
can
see
de
show
asked
micky
eagerly
as
they
walked
along
positive
said
joe
here
a
reserved
seat
ticket
now
two
in
fact
in
case
you
want
to
take
some
one
i
take
me
mudder
declared
the
lad
i
got
a
girl
but
she
wit
another
feller
he
bought
two
tickets
but
dey
was
reserved
seats
i
did
have
the
dough
dat
why
she
shook
me
i
guess
but
when
i
flash
dese
on
her
say
maybe
she
wo
want
to
shine
up
at
me
again
but
nothin
doin
i
take
me
mudder
she
needs
a
change
after
waitin
on
dat
guy
what
been
on
a
spree
how
long
has
logan
been
ill
asked
joe
oh
he
been
in
kelly
joint
for
a
week
he
must
have
been
waiting
for
the
circus
to
arrive
thought
joe
he
knew
we
were
booked
for
here
poor
fellow
joe
was
glad
it
was
still
light
when
he
entered
the
district
where
kelly
café
or
saloon
to
be
more
exact
was
situated
for
the
place
was
most
disreputable
in
appearance
and
the
character
of
men
loitering
about
it
would
have
made
it
a
place
to
stay
away
from
after
dark
suspicious
eyes
looked
at
joe
as
he
entered
the
place
with
his
young
guide
he
come
to
see
de
sick
guy
micky
explained
to
the
bartender
well
i
hope
he
come
to
pay
what
owin
was
the
surly
comment
i
settle
any
bills
that
logan
may
owe
for
board
or
lodging
said
joe
board
he
do
owe
much
for
sneered
the
barkeeper
he
has
eaten
enough
to
keep
a
fly
alive
but
he
does
owe
for
his
room
i
pay
that
offered
joe
then
he
was
guided
upstairs
to
a
squalid
room
come
in
called
a
weak
voice
and
joe
pushing
back
the
door
saw
lying
on
a
tumbled
bed
the
form
of
the
old
it
was
a
great
change
ham
logan
was
in
even
worse
condition
than
when
he
had
applied
to
joe
for
work
he
was
utterly
disreputable
but
in
spite
of
that
there
was
something
about
his
face
and
eyes
that
gave
joe
hope
the
man
was
sober
that
was
one
thing
as
joe
looked
at
him
ham
turned
his
face
away
i
i
ashamed
to
have
you
see
me
he
murmured
i
fought
it
off
as
long
as
i
could
but
i
just
had
to
see
you
is
for
my
own
sake
he
added
quickly
i
know
you
through
with
me
but
it
for
your
own
and
the
good
of
the
show
i
got
something
to
tell
you
and
when
i
done
that
you
can
go
away
again
and
forget
me
that
all
i
fit
for
to
be
forgotten
a
dry
sob
shook
his
emaciated
frame
son
here
a
quarter
said
joe
to
the
micky
you
go
out
and
get
yourself
an
soda
and
come
back
in
half
an
hour
and
after
he
had
thus
delicately
removed
a
witness
to
the
sad
scene
joe
closed
the
door
and
going
over
to
the
bed
held
out
both
his
hands
to
the
man
and
then
tears
tears
to
which
he
had
long
been
stranger
coursed
down
the
sunken
cheeks
of
hamilton
logan
just
what
joe
said
to
the
man
whom
he
had
befriended
and
who
had
gone
back
to
his
old
ways
and
what
ham
logan
said
to
his
young
benefactor
will
never
be
known
neither
would
tell
and
no
one
else
knew
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
did
not
matter
afterward
though
following
some
sensational
happenings
which
did
become
known
joe
told
his
closest
friends
enough
of
ham
story
to
make
clear
the
trend
of
events
punctually
on
the
time
agreed
micky
donlon
was
back
at
his
post
joe
was
coming
out
of
the
room

the
rest
of

joe
and
his
guide
took
a
jitney
to
the
nearest
public
hack
stand
where
a
number
of
automobiles
were
waiting
and
joe
entered
one
of
these
with
micky
gee
if
me
girl
could
see
me
murmured
the
lad
as
he
sank
back
in
the
deep
seat
joe
was
too
preoccupied
to
more
than
smile
at
the
lad
there
was
much
that
remained
to
be
done
the
circus
was
to
remain
in
this
city
two
days
more
over
saturday
night
in
fact
leaving
on
sunday
for
a
distant
city
there
time
enough
to
trap
them
mused
joe
time
enough
to
trap
them
and
getting
back
to
the
show
lot
he
dismissed
the
automobile
and
taking
micky
with
him
sought
out
jim
tracy
moyne
and
some
of
the
other
circus
executives
and
then
the
trap
was
set
chapter
xxv
a
blaze
of
glory
well
remarked
joe
after
having
talked
rapidly
and
said
considerable
to
his
friends
what
do
you
think
of
my
news
great
declared
the
ringmaster
i
did
think
things
would
take
just
that
turn
but
after
loper
confession
and
what
ham
told
you
i
believe
it
all
that
scoundrel
ought
to
be
sent
away
for
life
he
go
for
a
long
time
if
i
have
anything
to
say
declared
the
treasurer
did
you
know
we
spotted
more
bogus
tickets
he
asked
joe
no
well
we
did
i
found
it
out
just
after
you
left
there
were
only
a
few
the
rush
will
come
unless
we
stop
it
put
in
jim
tracy
we
stop
it
decided
joe
that
why
i
wanted
to
get
things
started
in
a
hurry
the
trap
is
all
ready
to
spring
the
detectives
will
be
here
at
eight
just
when
the
rush
is
at
its
height
at
the
ticket
wagon
are
you
going
to
bring
ham
back
asked
jim
when
the
conference
was
over
i
certainly
am
was
the
answer
i
think
he
been
on
his
last
spree
and
he
would
have
gone
on
this
one
only
that
he
was
tempted
by
some
person
put
this
tempter
out
of
the
way
and
it
will
mean
ham
safety
now
we
got
to
work
there
was
an
exceedingly
busy
time
at
the
circus
from
then
on
and
very
little
of
it
concerned
the
show
itself
the
performance
was
delayed
half
an
hour
that
night
to
enable
the
trap
to
be
sprung
joe
and
jim
tracy
met
a
certain
train
that
came
in
from
a
large
city
and
saw
alight
from
it
two
quiet
unassuming
men
there
they
are
said
joe
now
things
will
move
and
he
and
the
ringmaster
were
soon
in
conversation
with
the
two
new
arrivals
a
little
later
the
four
entered
joe
dressing
tent
at
the
circus
grounds
and
some
time
after
that
four
men
whose
faces
were
black
from
the
smudge
of
machine
oil
and
grease
and
whose
clothes
carried
like
marks
left
joe
quarters
down
near
the
shipyards
when
the
last
of
the
day
shift
comes
off
will
be
the
time
and
place
said
one
of
the
four
men
right
declared
another
from
the
big
shipyard
poured
hundreds
of
men
as
they
began
to
emerge
from
the
gate
the
four
individuals
who
had
come
from
dressing
tent
mingled
with
them
they
heard
some
one
ask
are
you
sure
the
tickets
be
good
sure
was
the
answer
this
fellow
and
his
pal
are
part
of
the
show
he
sells
this
way
so
there
wo
be
such
a
crowd
at
the
wagon
and
that
why
he
makes
such
a
big
discount
it
sort
of
guarantees
a
pretty
big
crowd
too
oh
the
tickets
are
good
all
right
there
the
ticket
guy
now
the
crowd
of
men
turned
down
a
side
street
and
the
four
men
went
with
them
one
of
the
four
said
wait
till
he
sells
a
few
tickets
and
then
nab
him
there
two
of
said
another
voice
nab
both
they
work
together
soon
the
men
from
the
shipyard
surrounded
the
two
men
one
of
whom
had
been
designated
by
the
sentence
there
the
ticket
guy
now
money
began
to
change
hands
and
tickets
were
passed
around
the
four
men
who
had
kept
together
shoved
their
way
through
the
crowd
of
ship
workers
how
much
are
the
tickets
one
asked
cents
was
the
answer
they
cost
you
fifty
or
at
the
wagon
the
only
reason
we
sell
this
way
is
to
avoid
the
rush
then
too
you
really
buying
at
wholesale
i
take
four
said
the
man
of
the
quartette
here
you
are
four
there
was
another
clink
of
money
and
a
rustle
of
slips
of
paper
then
the
man
who
had
passed
over
the
tickets
said
here
your
change
that
was
a
five
you
gave
me
was
it
take
your
change
and
you
take
yours
bill
carfax
suddenly
cried
one
of
the
four
quite
a
sudden
change
too
there
was
a
flash
of
something
bright
a
metallic
click
two
of
them
in
fact
and
the
ticket
seller
tried
to
break
away
but
he
was
held
by
the
handcuffs
on
his
wrists
one
of
the
four
grasping
them
by
the
connecting
chain
get
the
other
cried
a
sharp
voice
there
was
a
scuffle
another
flash
of
something
bright
two
more
clicks
and
one
of
the
four
cried
that
be
about
all
from
you
jed
lewis
inky
jed
the
two
handcuffed
men
seemed
to
know
that
the
game
was
up
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
looked
at
each
other
and
grew
quiet
suddenly
the
set
trap
had
been
successfully
sprung
hey
what
the
big
idea
what
it
all
about
do
we
get
our
tickets
thus
cried
the
men
from
the
shipyards
you
do
want
these
tickets
said
joe
strong
for
as
bill
carfax
looked
more
closely
at
one
of
the
four
he
recognized
him
as
the
young
circus
man
you
do
want
any
tickets
these
men
could
sell
you
why
not
demanded
a
man
who
had
bought
one
because
they
counterfeit
was
joe
answer
this
man
bill
carfax
and
he
nodded
toward
the
one
first
handcuffed
used
to
work
with
the
sampson
show
he
was
discharged
ask
him
to
tell
you
why
and
soon
after
that
we
began
to
be
cheated
by
the
use
of
counterfeit
tickets
we
have
been
trying
ever
since
to
find
out
who
sold
them
and
now
we
have
you
think
you
have
sneered
the
man
who
had
been
called
inky
jed
we
know
it
said
joe
decidedly
ham
logan
overheard
your
plans
discussed
and
he
told
everything
oh
exclaimed
bill
carfax
and
there
was
a
world
of
meaning
in
that
simple
interjection
and
who
might
you
guys
be
asked
one
of
the
shipyard
men
i
one
of
the
circus
owners
said
joe
quietly
and
this
is
the
ringmaster
he
went
on
indicating
jim
tracy
these
other
two
gentlemen
are
detectives
who
have
been
working
on
the
case
since
we
discovered
the
counterfeits
we
disguised
ourselves
in
this
way
in
order
to
trap
these
two
and
he
pointed
to
the
handcuffed
men
the
ship
workers
nodded
one
of
them
asked
and
are
they
with
your
show
and
ca
they
sell
tickets
at
reduced
prices
never
exclaimed
joe
you
might
get
in
on
the
tickets
you
bought
from
them
but
it
would
be
illegally
the
counterfeits
are
clever
ones
he
said
holding
up
four
he
had
bought
for
evidence
but
we
can
detect
the
difference
by
means
of
the
serial
numbers
and
now
if
you
men
really
want
to
see
the
show
go
up
to
the
lot
and
get
your
tickets
from
the
wagon
or
buy
them
at
one
of
the
authorized
agencies
there
were
many
questions
fired
at
joe
and
his
friends
by
the
shipyard
men
but
they
had
time
to
answer
only
a
few
we
got
to
get
back
to
the
performance
said
joe
to
the
detectives
you
can
take
them
with
you
and
he
nodded
toward
bill
carfax
and
his
crony
jim
and
i
will
see
you
later
oh
we
take
them
with
us
all
right
laughed
one
of
the
detectives
move
lively
boys
he
added
to
the
two
prisoners
the
jig
is
up
and
the
two
counterfeiters
seemed
to
know
it
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
helen
of
joe
when
he
got
back
a
little
before
the
time
to
go
on
with
his
acts
he
had
washed
his
face
and
changed
to
his
circus
costume
the
two
prisoners
had
been
locked
up
well
it
means
we
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone
said
joe
we
got
rid
of
the
men
who
have
been
making
us
lose
money
my
means
of
the
counterfeit
tickets
and
we
have
also
under
lock
and
key
bill
carfax
who
tried
several
times
to
injure
me
or
at
least
to
spoil
my
act
by
means
of
acid
on
the
trapeze
rope
and
by
changing
the
fireproof
mixture
oh
i
so
glad
cried
helen
then
you
were
in
danger
i
suppose
so
danger
of
injury
perhaps
but
hardly
death
i
think
carfax
desperate
as
he
was
would
stop
at
that
how
did
you
find
out
about
him
and
the
other
man
i
just
have
time
to
tell
you
before
my
first
act
said
joe
it
was
harry
loper
who
gave
me
the
first
idea
when
he
broke
down
it
was
because
of
what
he
had
done
and
on
account
of
what
bill
carfax
wanted
him
to
do
again
it
was
bill
who
got
into
the
tent
once
and
put
acid
on
my
trapeze
wire
and
it
was
because
he
bribed
poor
loper
that
he
was
able
to
do
it
bill
pretended
it
was
only
a
trick
to
make
me
slip
because
he
wanted
to
get
even
with
me
for
discharging
him
so
poor
weak
harry
let
him
sneak
into
the
tent
disguised
so
none
of
our
men
would
know
him
bill
climbed
up
put
acid
on
the
wire
and
the
fiery
stuff
did
the
rest
well
that
preyed
on
harry
mind
but
he
kept
putting
it
away
but
finally
knowing
the
hold
he
had
on
him
bill
came
back
and
gave
him
a
bottle
of
acid
to
work
some
further
harm
to
me
or
my
apparatus
but
ham
discovered
that
in
time
bill
was
provoked
over
his
failure
and
when
he
was
helping
inky
jed
get
out
the
bogus
tickets
he
followed
the
show
and
tried
to
prevail
on
harry
to
play
another
trick
on
me
just
what
it
was
harry
know
he
refused
to
do
it
and
then
he
came
and
confessed
to
me
so
much
for
harry
he
a
sorry
boy
and
i
think
he
turn
over
a
new
leaf
now
about
ham
just
as
i
feared
he
got
to
drinking
again
but
it
was
because
bill
met
him
when
poor
ham
nerves
were
on
edge
and
bill
induced
him
to
take
liquor
then
ham
went
all
to
pieces
and
started
on
a
spree
which
lasted
until
now
he
managed
to
get
from
place
to
place
always
under
bill
eye
and
at
last
he
landed
here
very
weak
and
donlon
looked
after
him
and
it
was
here
that
ham
first
heard
bill
and
his
crony
plotting
about
the
bogus
circus
tickets
the
two
counterfeiters
planned
to
make
a
big
strike
here
with
the
shipyard
workers
then
ham
sent
the
warning
to
me
i
called
on
him
learned
the
plans
of
bill
and
jed
and
we
sent
for
the
detectives
the
latter
we
learned
were
about
to
make
an
arrest
anyhow
but
it
was
of
the
men
who
really
printed
the
bogus
tickets
they
had
a
clew
as
yet
to
bill
and
jed
who
were
the
real
backers
of
the
game
the
detectives
came
on
disguised
themselves
with
us
and
we
caught
the
scoundrels
in
the
very
act
now
they
locked
up
oh
joe
it
wonderful
exclaimed
helen
i
so
glad
it
all
over
and
are
you
going
to
bring
ham
back
to
the
show
just
as
soon
as
he
able
to
travel
micky
donlon
wants
to
join
too
and
i
may
give
him
a
chance
later
well
our
troubles
seem
to
be
over
for
a
time
but
i
suppose
there
be
more
oh
look
on
the
bright
side
exclaimed
helen
why
be
a
if
you
ca
look
on
the
bright
side
she
laughed
that
so
agreed
her
admirer
well
i
got
to
get
ready
to
eat
some
fire
right
now
as
joe
had
said
everything
was
cleared
up
bill
carfax
was
at
the
bottom
of
most
of
the
personal
troubles
of
the
young
circus
man
and
his
acts
were
actuated
by
a
desire
for
vengeance
as
to
the
ticket
trick
bill
was
only
a
sort
of
agent
in
that
jed
lewis
alias
inky
jed
was
an
expert
counterfeiter
he
had
already
served
time
in
prison
for
trying
to
make
counterfeit
money
and
when
he
fell
in
with
bill
and
heard
the
latter
tell
of
some
of
his
circus
experiences
the
more
skillful
scoundrel
became
impressed
with
the
chance
of
making
money
by
selling
spurious
tickets
they
had
some
printed
and
worked
the
scheme
among
crowds
of
men
coming
from
factories
just
as
they
were
doing
when
they
were
caught
as
ham
told
joe
the
old
had
overheard
the
plots
and
saw
his
chance
to
do
joe
a
favor
carfax
it
was
surmised
hoped
to
get
ham
logan
under
his
influence
through
drink
so
that
he
might
use
him
in
order
to
injure
joe
after
having
failed
with
harry
loper
it
developed
afterward
that
the
paper
mills
had
innocently
enough
furnished
the
swindlers
with
the
paper
for
the
counterfeit
tickets
the
material
was
secured
through
a
trick
and
inky
jed
knew
an
unscrupulous
printer
who
did
the
work
for
him
it
was
bill
carfax
who
had
sent
the
man
who
so
nearly
exposed
joe
box
trick
but
fortune
was
with
the
young
circus
man
the
music
played
the
horses
trotted
about
clowns
made
laughter
and
helen
performed
graceful
feats
on
rosebud
joe
did
some
magical
tricks
walked
the
wire
slid
down
on
his
head
and
then
prepared
for
the
blazing
banquet
in
order
to
show
what
he
could
do
ted
brown
had
introduced
some
novelties
after
joe
and
the
guests
had
devoured
the
blazing
food
there
was
a
pause
and
then
suddenly
from
the
center
of
the
table
spouts
of
red
fire
burst
out
so
that
the
banquet
ended
in
a
blaze
of
glory
joe
new
helper
had
used
some
fireworks
effectively
in
due
time
bill
and
his
crony
were
tried
convicted
and
sent
away
to
prison
for
long
terms
harry
loper
changed
his
rather
loose
and
weak
ways
and
became
one
of
joe
best
friends
ted
brown
was
continued
as
an
assistant
assistant
for
in
a
few
weeks
ham
logan
was
able
to
rejoin
the
show
and
he
again
became
joe
chief
helper
well
what
are
you
going
to
spring
next
on
the
unsuspecting
public
as
a
sensation
asked
helen
when
the
show
had
reached
a
city
where
two
days
were
to
be
spent
have
you
other
acts
as
good
a
the
well
perhaps
i
can
think
up
some
was
the
answer
and
so
with
joe
strong
thinking
what
the
future
might
hold
for
him
and
the
circus
we
will
take
our
leave
for
a
time
the
end
