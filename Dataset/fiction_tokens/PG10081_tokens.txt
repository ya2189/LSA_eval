a
great
long
gray
shape
moved
swiftly
through
the
waters
of
the
thames
smoke
pouring
from
three
different
points
in
the
middle
of
this
great
shape
ascended
straight
in
the
air
some
distance
then
caught
by
the
wind
drifted
westward
it
was
growing
dark
several
hours
before
this
ocean
greyhound
one
of
great
britain
monster
had
and
left
her
dock
where
she
had
been
undergoing
slight
repairs
heading
eastward
down
the
river
men
lined
the
rails
of
the
monster
ship
these
were
her
crew
or
some
of
her
crew
to
be
exact
for
the
others
were
engaged
in
duties
that
prevented
them
from
waving
to
the
crowds
that
thronged
the
shore
as
did
the
men
on
deck
sharp
orders
carried
across
the
water
to
the
ears
of
those
on
shore
the
officers
were
issuing
commands
men
left
the
rail
and
disappeared
from
the
view
of
the
spectators
as
they
hurried
to
perform
their
duties
came
several
sharp
blasts
of
the
vessel
siren
a
moment
later
her
speed
increased
and
as
she
slid
easily
through
the
waters
of
the
river
a
cheer
went
up
from
both
shores
the
crowd
strained
its
eyes
far
down
the
river
now
the
giant
battleship
was
disappearing
from
the
sight
of
the
men
and
women
who
lined
the
banks
in
vain
a
few
moments
later
did
many
eyes
try
to
pierce
the
darkness
the
battleship
was
lost
to
sight
the
vessel
that
had
thus
passed
down
the
thames
was
one
of
the
most
formidable
of
england
sea
fighters
it
was
with
such
ships
as
the
supported
by
smaller
and
less
powerful
craft
that
great
britain
for
almost
two
years
of
the
great
war
had
maintained
her
supremacy
of
the
seas
this
great
ship
was
new
in
service
having
been
completed
only
a
few
years
before
the
outbreak
of
the
war
she
was
constructed
at
a
cost
of
she
was
feet
long
of
tons
burden
and
had
a
complement
of
almost
men
for
fighting
purposes
she
was
equipped
with
all
that
was
modern
in
her
forward
turret
she
carried
a
battery
of
six
guns
aft
the
turret
was
similarly
equipped
also
the
mounted
other
big
guns
and
rapid
firers
she
was
equipped
with
an
even
torpedo
tubes
she
was
one
of
the
biggest
ships
of
war
that
roved
the
seas
the
was
one
of
the
fleet
of
battleships
that
had
patrolled
the
north
sea
since
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
already
she
had
seen
her
share
of
fighting
for
she
had
led
more
than
one
attack
upon
the
enemy
when
the
germans
had
mustered
up
courage
enough
to
leave
the
safety
of
the
great
fortress
of
heligoland
where
the
main
german
high
sea
fleet
was
quartered
it
had
been
in
a
skirmish
with
one
of
these
venturesome
enemy
vessels
that
the
had
received
injuries
that
necessitated
her
going
into
dry
dock
for
a
few
days
while
she
was
given
an
overhauling
and
her
wounds
healed
true
enough
she
had
sent
the
foe
to
the
bottom
but
with
a
last
dying
shot
the
germans
had
put
a
shell
aboard
the
her
damage
repaired
the
was
now
steaming
to
the
open
waters
of
the
north
sea
where
she
would
again
take
up
patrol
duty
with
the
other
vessels
that
comprised
the
british
north
sea
fleet
under
command
of
beatty
whose
flagship
the
had
taken
up
the
additional
burden
of
patrolling
the
territory
while
the
latter
was
being
overhauled
aboard
the
battleship
the
british
tars
who
had
become
fretful
at
the
delay
were
happy
at
the
thought
of
getting
back
into
active
service
while
they
had
been
given
an
opportunity
to
stretch
their
legs
ashore
they
nevertheless
had
been
glad
when
the
time
to
steam
back
into
the
open
sea
had
come
now
as
the
entered
the
mouth
of
the
thames
and
prepared
to
leave
the
shores
of
old
england
for
the
broad
expanse
of
the
north
sea
they
sang
whistled
and
laughed
gaily
they
were
going
back
where
they
would
get
another
chance
at
the
enemy
should
he
again
venture
from
his
lair
forward
upon
the
upper
deck
stood
two
young
officers
who
peered
into
the
darkness
ahead
to
my
mind
said
one
this
beats
a
submarine
just
look
about
you
consider
the
size
of
this
battleship
look
at
her
armament
think
of
the
number
of
men
aboard
you
may
be
right
returned
the
second
officer
but
we
have
had
some
grand
times
beneath
the
sea
we
have
been
to
places
and
seen
things
that
otherwise
would
have
been
impossible
true
enough
but
at
the
same
time
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
fight
we
have
had
to
slink
about
like
a
cat
in
the
night
afraid
to
show
ourselves
to
larger
and
heavier
adversaries
now
aboard
the
that
will
be
done
away
with
now
we
are
the
cat
rather
than
the
mouse
it
may
be
that
i
shall
come
to
your
way
of
thinking
in
time
said
the
second
speaker
but
at
this
moment
i
would
rather
have
the
familiar
feel
of
a
submarine
beneath
my
heel
i
would
feel
more
at
home
there
besides
we
have
lost
one
thing
by
being
assigned
to
the
that
hits
me
rather
hard
i
know
what
you
mean
said
the
first
speaker
we
indeed
have
lost
the
companionship
of
a
gallant
commander
captain
raleigh
undoubtedly
is
a
first
class
officer
otherwise
he
would
not
be
in
command
of
the
but
we
are
bound
to
miss
lord
hastings
indeed
we
are
yet
as
he
told
us
things
can
not
always
be
as
we
would
like
to
have
them
he
was
called
for
other
service
as
you
know
and
he
did
his
best
for
us
that
is
why
we
find
ourselves
here
as
minor
officers
yes
and
it
a
whole
lot
different
than
being
the
second
and
third
in
command
at
that
moment
another
young
officer
hurried
by
coming
templeton
coming
chadwick
he
asked
as
he
passed
where
demanded
the
two
friends
did
you
hear
the
call
for
mess
no
by
jove
and
i
hungry
too
said
the
young
officer
addressed
as
templeton
come
along
frank
we
have
been
so
busy
talking
here
that
we
had
forgotten
all
about
the
demands
of
the
inner
man
the
two
hurried
after
the
officer
who
had
accosted
them
and
while
they
are
attending
to
the
wants
of
the
inner
man
as
templeton
termed
their
appetites
we
will
take
the
time
to
explain
how
these
two
lads
came
to
be
aboard
the
giant
battleship
steaming
into
the
north
sea
in
search
of
the
enemies
of
great
britain
and
her
allies
frank
chadwick
was
an
american
youth
of
some
eighteen
years
separated
from
his
father
in
naples
at
the
outbreak
of
the
great
war
he
had
been
shanghaied
aboard
a
sailing
vessel
when
he
had
gone
to
the
aid
of
a
man
apparently
in
distress
there
he
was
made
a
prisoner
some
days
later
he
had
been
rescued
by
jack
templeton
a
young
englishman
who
had
boarded
the
vessel
off
the
coast
of
africa
seeking
payment
for
goods
he
had
sold
to
the
mutinous
crew
the
two
lads
had
been
instrumental
in
helping
lord
hastings
a
british
nobleman
put
through
a
coup
that
kept
italy
out
of
the
war
on
the
side
of
germany
and
austria
lord
hastings
had
become
greatly
attached
to
the
lads
and
when
he
had
been
put
in
command
of
a
vessel
he
had
both
boys
assigned
to
his
ship
through
gallant
service
frank
and
jack
had
won
their
lieutenancies
later
lord
hastings
had
assumed
command
of
a
submarine
and
had
made
jack
his
first
officer
and
frank
his
second
officer
through
many
a
tight
place
the
lads
had
gone
safely
though
they
had
faced
death
more
than
once
and
faced
it
calmly
and
bravely
also
at
this
period
of
the
war
they
had
seen
service
in
many
seas
they
had
been
engaged
in
the
first
battle
of
the
north
sea
when
great
britain
had
struck
her
first
hard
blow
they
had
participated
in
the
sinking
of
the
german
atlantic
squadron
near
the
falkland
islands
off
the
coast
of
argentina
in
south
america
they
had
fought
in
turkish
waters
and
in
the
indian
ocean
and
also
had
been
with
the
british
land
forces
when
the
japanese
allies
of
the
english
had
won
the
last
of
the
german
possessions
in
china
in
stature
and
disposition
the
boys
were
as
different
as
could
be
frank
though
large
for
his
age
looked
small
when
alongside
of
jack
the
latter
though
no
older
than
his
friend
was
a
huge
bulk
of
a
boy
standing
well
over
six
feet
he
was
built
proportionately
strong
as
an
ox
he
was
and
cool
of
head
here
he
differed
from
frank
who
had
something
of
a
temper
and
was
likely
to
do
something
foolish
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
if
he
became
angry
jack
had
served
as
a
damper
for
his
friend
anger
and
enthusiasm
more
than
once
that
they
could
fight
both
boys
had
shown
more
than
once
jack
because
of
his
huge
bulk
and
great
strength
was
of
course
harder
to
beat
in
a
struggle
than
was
frank
but
what
the
latter
lacked
in
this
kind
of
fighting
he
more
than
made
up
in
the
use
of
revolver
rifle
or
sword
frank
was
a
crack
shot
with
a
revolver
and
more
than
once
this
accomplishment
had
stood
them
both
in
good
stead
each
was
a
good
linguist
and
conversed
in
french
and
german
as
well
as
in
english
this
also
had
been
of
help
to
them
in
several
ticklish
situations
on
their
last
venture
at
which
time
they
had
been
under
command
of
lord
hastings
they
had
reached
the
distant
shores
of
russia
where
they
had
been
of
some
assistance
to
the
czar
in
reaching
petrograd
it
had
been
necessary
for
them
to
pass
through
the
kiel
canal
which
they
had
done
safely
in
their
submarine
in
spite
of
the
german
warships
and
harbor
defenses
also
they
had
managed
to
sink
several
enemy
vessels
there
returning
frank
and
jack
had
gone
home
with
lord
hastings
where
lady
hastings
had
insisted
that
they
remain
quiet
for
some
time
this
they
had
done
and
had
been
glad
of
the
rest
one
day
lord
hastings
had
come
home
with
the
announcement
that
he
had
been
called
back
into
the
diplomatic
service
it
was
the
aim
of
the
british
government
to
align
greece
and
roumania
on
the
side
of
the
allies
realizing
that
they
could
not
hope
to
accompany
lord
hastings
and
not
wishing
to
remain
idle
longer
frank
and
jack
had
requested
lord
hastings
to
have
them
assigned
on
active
duty
at
once
lord
hastings
promised
to
do
his
best
and
this
was
the
reason
that
frank
chadwick
and
jack
templeton
found
themselves
aboard
when
she
steamed
out
to
the
north
sea
on
an
evening
in
the
last
week
of
may
chapter
ii
a
bit
of
history
up
to
this
time
the
german
sea
fleet
as
a
unit
had
suffered
comparatively
little
damage
in
the
great
war
sheltered
as
it
was
behind
the
great
fortress
of
heligoland
the
british
sea
forces
had
been
unable
to
reach
it
nor
would
the
germans
venture
forth
to
give
battle
to
the
english
in
spite
of
the
bait
that
more
than
once
had
been
placed
just
outside
the
mine
fields
that
guarded
the
approach
to
the
great
german
fortress
itself
to
have
attacked
this
fortress
would
have
been
foolhardy
and
the
british
knew
it
the
british
fleet
powerful
though
it
was
would
have
been
no
match
for
the
great
guns
of
the
german
fortress
even
had
the
battleships
been
able
to
force
a
passage
of
the
mine
fields
and
this
latter
feat
would
have
been
a
wonderful
one
in
itself
could
it
be
accomplished
upon
several
occasions
german
battleships
cruisers
and
submarines
had
ventured
from
behind
the
mine
field
and
had
delivered
raids
upon
the
british
coast
almost
miles
away
how
they
escaped
the
eyes
of
the
waiting
british
was
a
riddle
that
so
far
had
not
been
explained
but
while
they
reached
alien
shores
in
safety
they
had
not
returned
with
the
same
success
twice
the
british
had
come
into
contact
with
these
german
raiders
and
in
each
case
the
enemy
had
come
off
second
best
several
german
cruisers
had
been
sent
to
the
bottom
after
occasions
like
these
the
germans
would
lie
long
behind
their
snug
walls
before
venturing
forth
into
the
open
again
they
held
the
british
navy
in
too
great
awe
to
treat
it
lightly
but
the
fact
that
the
british
were
able
to
keep
the
german
fleet
bottled
up
was
a
victory
in
itself
though
a
bloodless
one
practically
all
commerce
with
germany
had
been
shut
off
it
settled
down
to
a
question
of
how
long
the
german
empire
could
survive
without
the
necessary
food
and
other
commodities
reaching
her
shores
what
little
in
the
way
of
foodstuffs
did
reach
germany
came
by
the
way
of
the
scandinavian
countries
norway
sweden
and
denmark
also
some
grain
was
still
being
shipped
in
by
the
way
of
roumania
and
was
being
transported
up
the
danube
which
had
been
opened
to
traffic
again
after
serbia
had
been
crushed
but
these
supplies
were
not
great
enough
to
take
care
of
the
whole
german
population
in
the
conquest
of
russian
poland
germany
had
improved
her
lot
somewhat
for
the
fertile
fields
had
immediately
been
planted
and
a
good
crop
had
been
reaped
and
the
one
thing
that
prevented
germany
from
importing
the
things
that
would
in
the
end
be
necessary
to
her
existence
was
the
british
supremacy
of
the
sea
abetted
now
somewhat
by
the
navies
of
france
italy
and
japan
german
commerce
had
been
cleared
from
the
seven
seas
what
vessels
of
war
had
been
scattered
over
the
world
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
had
either
been
sent
to
the
bottom
captured
or
were
interned
in
foreign
ports
these
latter
were
of
no
value
to
germany
it
had
been
more
than
a
year
now
since
the
last
german
commerce
raider
had
been
sunk
the
german
commercial
flag
was
seen
no
more
in
the
four
corners
of
the
globe
it
appeared
that
germany
was
nearing
the
end
of
her
rope
and
yet
bottled
up
in
heligoland
remained
the
german
high
sea
fleet
practically
intact
it
was
a
formidable
fleet
and
one
it
seemed
that
should
not
be
afraid
to
venture
from
behind
the
protection
of
the
fortress
and
some
day
the
world
knew
when
all
other
ways
had
failed
this
great
fleet
would
steam
forth
to
give
battle
to
the
british
in
a
last
effort
of
the
german
emperor
to
turn
the
tide
in
his
favor
and
while
in
the
allied
nations
at
least
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
ultimate
outcome
of
such
a
struggle
it
was
realized
that
the
german
fleet
would
give
a
good
account
of
itself
when
it
did
venture
forth
therefore
it
was
considered
just
as
well
that
the
british
keep
the
german
high
sea
fleet
bottled
up
and
give
it
no
chance
to
reach
the
open
where
although
the
greater
part
might
be
sent
to
the
bottom
some
vessels
might
escape
and
embark
upon
a
cruise
of
commerce
warfare
this
bloodless
victory
it
was
pointed
out
was
of
just
as
great
value
to
great
britain
as
if
all
the
german
ships
of
war
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
north
sea
bottled
up
as
they
were
they
were
just
as
ineffective
this
was
the
situation
then
when
the
mary
with
jack
and
frank
aboard
steamed
down
the
thames
and
out
into
the
north
sea
to
take
up
again
her
patrol
of
those
waters
and
there
was
nothing
to
warn
those
on
board
of
the
great
battle
that
even
now
was
impending
and
that
was
to
result
disastrously
for
great
britain
even
though
the
germans
were
to
suffer
no
less
mess
over
frank
and
jack
made
their
way
to
their
own
quarters
amidships
here
they
sat
down
and
for
some
time
talked
over
the
events
of
the
days
gone
by
i
guess
there
will
be
nothing
for
us
to
do
this
night
said
frank
at
last
we
may
as
well
turn
in
i
am
afraid
there
will
be
nothing
for
us
to
do
for
some
time
to
come
was
jack
reply
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
rather
monotonous
sailing
about
the
north
sea
looking
for
german
warships
when
the
latter
are
afraid
to
come
out
and
fight
well
you
ca
tell
said
frank
however
that
one
beauty
of
a
submarine
you
do
have
to
wait
around
for
something
to
happen
you
can
go
out
and
make
it
happen
that
so
but
by
jove
i
wish
these
fellows
would
come
out
and
fight
maybe
we
could
put
an
end
to
this
war
real
quickly
yes
but
we
might
not
returned
frank
why
do
you
think
we
can
thrash
them
i
suppose
we
can
but
at
the
same
time
they
can
do
a
lot
of
damage
besides
some
of
them
have
come
out
we
sunk
some
of
course
but
the
others
have
returned
safely
enough
i
ca
see
any
excuse
for
that
it
does
seem
that
they
should
have
been
caught
jack
agreed
but
i
guess
admiral
jellicoe
admiral
beatty
and
the
admiralty
know
what
is
going
on
sometimes
it
does
look
like
it
declared
frank
i
suppose
there
are
still
some
of
these
german
submarines
scooting
about
almost
under
our
feet
i
suppose
so
however
ordinarily
as
you
know
they
wo
attack
a
battleship
it
too
risky
if
they
miss
with
the
first
torpedo
the
chances
are
they
will
be
sunk
well
we
sunk
a
few
said
frank
i
know
we
did
but
we
took
long
chances
the
germans
take
long
chances
too
you
must
have
a
little
german
blood
in
you
frank
said
jack
with
a
smile
if
i
did
know
you
better
i
would
think
you
were
sticking
up
for
them
no
i
not
sticking
up
for
them
but
they
do
things
we
seem
to
be
afraid
to
do
to
my
way
of
thinking
we
should
have
gone
and
cleaned
up
heligoland
a
long
time
ago
by
jove
you
want
the
enemy
to
win
this
war
quickly
do
you
no
but
come
now
you
know
very
well
what
would
have
happened
if
we
had
tried
to
take
a
fleet
into
heligoland
they
would
have
blown
us
out
of
the
water
well
such
things
have
been
done
grumbled
frank
i
can
tell
you
a
couple
of
cases
at
mobile
bay
oh
i
heard
all
that
before
but
conditions
now
are
absolutely
different
what
was
done
fifty
years
ago
ca
be
done
today
they
are
being
done
that
much
is
sure
replied
frank
but
this
argument
is
not
doing
us
any
good
me
for
a
little
sleep
i
with
you
said
jack
and
half
an
hour
later
as
the
still
steamed
due
east
frank
and
jack
slept
above
the
third
officer
held
the
bridge
the
great
searchlight
forward
lighted
the
water
for
some
distance
ahead
and
aft
a
second
light
cast
its
powerful
rays
first
to
port
and
then
to
starboard
there
was
not
another
vessel
in
sight
farther
to
the
east
other
british
battleships
patrolled
the
sea
their
lights
also
flashing
back
and
forth
it
would
be
a
bold
enemy
who
would
venture
to
run
that
blockade
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
the
strictest
watch
was
maintained
for
the
fact
still
remained
fresh
in
the
minds
of
the
british
that
upon
two
occasions
the
germans
had
run
the
british
blockade
and
both
times
the
failure
of
the
british
to
intercept
them
had
resulted
in
heavy
loss
of
life
on
the
coast
where
the
german
warships
had
shelled
unfortified
towns
against
all
rules
of
civilized
warfare
killing
thousands
of
helpless
men
women
and
children
it
was
against
some
such
similar
attack
that
the
british
warships
were
patrolling
every
mile
of
water
the
british
coast
must
be
protected
no
more
german
raiders
must
be
allowed
to
slip
through
and
bombard
undefended
coast
towns
also
strict
watch
was
kept
aloft
for
almost
nightly
now
huge
german
zeppelins
were
sailing
across
the
sea
and
dropping
bombs
upon
the
coast
of
kent
upon
dover
and
close
even
to
london
itself
it
was
feared
that
one
of
these
monsters
of
the
air
might
swoop
down
upon
the
battleships
and
with
a
well
directed
bomb
send
the
vessel
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
all
british
war
vessels
were
equipped
with
guns
and
these
were
ever
loaded
and
ready
for
action
for
there
was
no
telling
what
moment
they
might
be
called
into
use
to
repel
a
foe
upon
several
occasions
attacks
of
the
zeppelins
had
been
beaten
off
with
these
guns
though
up
to
date
none
had
been
brought
down
but
now
there
had
been
perfected
a
new
gun
with
this
it
was
believed
that
the
battleship
stood
a
good
chance
of
bringing
down
a
zeppelin
should
it
venture
near
enough
with
such
a
gun
the
had
been
equipped
as
she
was
overhauled
in
dry
dock
with
this
gun
went
four
men
one
to
stand
by
the
gun
at
night
and
keep
watch
of
the
sky
and
a
second
to
do
duty
in
the
day
time
the
other
two
men
stood
relief
watches
and
were
of
additional
need
should
one
of
the
first
men
be
injured
taken
sick
or
killed
and
so
it
was
that
as
the
continued
on
her
way
one
of
these
men
stood
by
his
gun
just
aft
of
the
bridge
watching
the
sky
nor
did
he
shirk
his
task
almost
continuously
his
eye
swept
the
dark
heavens
following
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
path
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
searchlights
he
used
powerful
night
glasses
for
this
purpose
suddenly
he
gave
a
start
he
looked
closely
again
through
his
glasses
then
he
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
the
third
officer
on
the
bridge
gave
an
exclamation
what
do
you
see
he
demanded
zeppelin
was
the
reply
douse
the
light
aft
have
the
man
forward
see
if
he
can
pick
up
the
craft
with
his
flash
about
two
points
east
by
north
there
came
sharp
commands
aboard
the
chapter
iii
warship
and
zeppelin
a
bell
tinkled
in
the
engine
room
of
the
the
ship
slowed
down
captain
raleigh
had
been
called
by
the
third
officer
he
took
the
bridge
and
issued
his
orders
sharply
there
was
no
telling
whether
the
zeppelin
sighted
by
the
man
at
the
gun
would
attack
the
ship
but
captain
raleigh
considered
it
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
that
was
why
he
had
left
orders
to
be
called
immediately
should
an
enemy
appear
again
a
bell
tinkled
in
the
engine
room
following
an
order
from
the
commander
of
the
the
great
engines
stopped
and
became
silent
cut
off
all
lights
was
the
next
command
a
moment
later
the
great
ship
was
in
darkness
frank
and
jack
in
their
quarters
were
awakened
by
the
sounds
of
confusion
above
all
hands
had
not
been
piped
on
deck
so
most
of
the
men
still
lay
asleep
unconscious
of
what
was
going
on
above
but
the
two
lads
dressing
hurriedly
made
their
way
on
deck
they
walked
forward
toward
the
bridge
all
was
dark
and
it
was
this
that
told
frank
and
jack
that
something
was
going
on
wonder
what
up
said
frank
airship
i
guess
was
the
reply
ca
see
any
other
reason
for
extinguishing
all
lights
near
the
bridge
the
lads
stopped
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
all
was
quiet
aboard
not
a
sound
came
from
the
officers
or
the
men
on
deck
then
captain
raleigh
commanded
try
the
forward
searchlight
there
see
if
you
can
pick
her
up
the
light
flashed
aloft
and
there
so
far
above
the
as
to
be
little
more
than
a
tiny
speck
hovered
a
giant
zeppelin
and
even
as
they
looked
the
airship
came
lower
she
sighted
us
said
captain
raleigh
to
his
first
officer
who
stood
beside
him
try
a
shot
mr
harrison
the
first
officer
passed
the
word
and
a
second
later
there
came
the
sound
of
the
gun
the
gunner
had
taken
his
range
at
the
moment
the
flashlight
revealed
the
airship
the
shot
brought
no
noticeable
result
fifteen
knots
ahead
mr
harrison
ordered
the
captain
he
was
afraid
that
the
zeppelin
might
drop
a
bomb
on
the
ship
and
from
that
moment
until
the
end
of
the
battle
the
did
not
pause
first
she
headed
to
port
and
then
to
starboard
manoeuvering
rapidly
that
the
german
airmen
might
not
be
able
to
reach
her
with
a
bomb
another
shot
commanded
captain
raleigh
still
no
result
funny
she
does
rise
and
try
and
escape
said
frank
no
it
not
returned
jack
they
do
know
anything
about
this
new
gun
they
believe
they
are
out
of
range
well
they
likely
to
hit
us
with
one
of
those
bombs
and
then
where
will
we
be
said
frank
if
they
hit
us
you
wo
know
anything
about
it
was
jack
response
again
the
tried
a
shot
at
the
zeppelin
a
cheer
went
up
from
the
members
of
the
crew
who
stood
upon
deck
for
the
zeppelin
was
seen
to
wabble
nicked
her
shouted
the
first
officer
jack
standing
near
the
rail
heard
something
whiz
by
his
head
instinctively
the
lad
ducked
he
knew
in
a
moment
what
had
passed
him
he
heard
something
splash
into
the
sea
bomb
just
missed
us
sir
he
cried
stepping
forward
where
demanded
captain
raleigh
right
here
forward
sir
replied
jack
captain
raleigh
gave
a
quick
command
to
his
first
officer
who
passed
it
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
hard
he
cried
the
ship
veered
crazily
and
at
the
some
moment
frank
who
was
standing
where
jack
had
been
a
moment
before
heard
something
swish
past
another
bomb
sir
he
reported
there
was
no
reply
from
the
bridge
captain
raleigh
felt
that
by
bringing
the
ship
head
hard
to
port
he
had
spoiled
the
range
of
the
enemy
in
the
air
for
some
time
no
more
bombs
dropped
near
again
the
fired
at
the
zeppelin
and
again
and
again
the
last
shot
was
rewarded
by
another
cheer
from
the
crew
the
giant
zeppelin
was
seen
to
drop
suddenly
the
crew
cheered
loud
and
long
for
it
appeared
that
the
zeppelin
was
about
to
drop
into
the
sea
down
she
came
and
still
down
and
then
her
descent
suddenly
halted
to
those
aboard
the
this
was
unexplainable
fire
again
quickly
shouted
the
captain
the
air
gun
boomed
at
the
same
moment
a
man
was
seen
to
lean
over
the
side
of
the
zeppelin
he
dropped
something
again
captain
raleigh
acted
promptly
and
brought
the
head
of
the
around
the
german
bomb
missed
before
another
could
be
dropped
the
man
who
manned
the
gun
fired
again
another
cheer
from
the
crew
the
zeppelin
began
to
sink
slowly
full
speed
ahead
cried
captain
raleigh
they
sink
us
the
leaped
ahead
just
in
time
and
then
the
zeppelin
dropped
with
a
splash
it
hit
the
water
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
british
battleship
came
cries
from
the
men
caught
beneath
the
gas
bag
at
that
moment
jack
stood
close
to
the
bridge
captain
raleigh
saw
him
man
a
boat
templeton
he
called
and
rescue
those
fellows
in
the
water
quickly
jack
sprang
to
obey
frank
leaped
after
him
hurriedly
a
small
boat
was
gotten
out
and
launched
a
half
dozen
sailors
sprang
in
and
took
up
the
oars
frank
and
jack
leaped
in
after
them
the
oars
glistened
in
the
glare
of
the
searchlight
as
the
men
raised
them
and
awaited
the
word
give
way
said
jack
the
boat
sped
over
the
smooth
surface
of
the
sea
close
to
the
wreckage
of
the
zeppelin
it
approached
and
cries
told
jack
that
some
of
the
germans
still
lived
hurry
he
cried
and
the
men
increased
their
stroke
near
the
wreckage
jack
gave
the
command
to
cease
rowing
a
german
swam
toward
the
boat
hands
helped
him
in
and
he
lay
in
the
bottom
panting
other
forms
swam
toward
them
these
too
were
lifted
in
the
boat
and
at
last
jack
counted
fifteen
germans
who
had
been
saved
are
you
all
here
he
asked
of
a
german
officer
all
but
commander
butz
sir
was
the
man
reply
jack
commanded
his
men
to
row
closer
to
the
wreckage
ahoy
there
he
shouted
when
he
had
come
close
the
lad
thought
he
heard
a
muffled
answer
but
he
could
not
make
sure
he
called
again
this
time
the
answer
came
plainer
where
are
you
asked
jack
under
the
wreckage
was
the
reply
jack
scrutinized
the
wreckage
closely
looks
like
it
might
sink
any
minute
he
said
but
we
ca
leave
him
there
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
frank
for
answer
jack
arose
in
the
boat
quickly
he
threw
off
his
coat
and
kicked
off
his
shoes
then
he
poised
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
boat
i
going
after
him
he
replied
before
frank
could
reply
he
had
dived
head
first
into
the
sea
with
a
cry
of
alarm
frank
also
sprang
to
his
feet
and
divested
himself
of
his
coat
and
shoes
stay
close
men
he
commanded
i
lend
a
hand
if
it
needed
he
too
leaped
into
the
water
rapidly
jack
swam
close
to
the
wreckage
he
continued
to
call
to
the
german
and
while
he
received
an
answer
each
time
he
could
not
locate
the
man
twice
he
swam
around
all
that
remained
of
the
huge
zeppelin
by
this
time
frank
had
come
up
with
him
ca
you
find
him
he
asked
no
returned
jack
and
i
am
rather
afraid
to
swim
under
there
the
balloon
may
sink
and
carry
me
under
but
if
i
were
certain
in
exactly
what
spot
the
man
is
imprisoned
i
have
a
try
at
it
frank
listened
attentively
and
directly
the
german
voice
came
again
to
frank
it
seemed
that
the
voice
came
from
directly
ahead
of
him
lay
hold
of
this
end
here
he
said
to
jack
if
you
can
lift
it
a
bit
i
go
under
and
have
a
look
better
let
me
do
it
frank
said
jack
no
you
stronger
than
i
am
you
can
hold
this
up
better
jack
did
as
his
chum
requested
and
a
moment
later
frank
disappeared
under
the
wreckage
diving
first
to
make
sure
that
he
got
under
under
the
water
the
lad
swam
forward
his
hand
touched
something
that
was
threshing
about
he
felt
sure
it
was
the
german
he
rose
his
head
came
in
contact
with
something
but
the
lad
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
that
he
was
above
the
surface
the
imprisoned
german
was
close
beside
him
dive
said
frank
you
can
come
out
all
right
ca
was
the
reply
my
arm
is
caught
frank
made
a
quick
examination
i
can
loosen
it
he
said
at
last
but
i
probably
break
the
arm
loosen
it
said
the
german
quietly
frank
took
a
firm
hold
on
the
arm
at
the
elbow
and
gave
a
quick
wrench
he
felt
something
give
and
when
he
released
his
hold
on
the
man
arm
the
latter
sank
suddenly
frank
dived
after
him
quickly
it
was
even
as
the
lad
feared
the
german
had
fainted
from
the
pain
of
the
arm
which
frank
had
broken
cleanly
as
he
released
it
frank
dived
deep
and
his
outstretched
hand
encountered
the
german
the
lad
grasped
the
man
firmly
by
the
collar
and
then
struck
upwards
a
moment
later
he
succeeded
in
making
his
way
to
where
jack
still
tugged
at
the
balloon
jack
lent
a
hand
and
they
dragged
the
german
from
beneath
the
wreckage
then
they
towed
him
to
the
boat
and
other
hands
lifted
him
in
frank
and
jack
clambered
aboard
give
way
said
jack
sharply
the
boat
moved
toward
the
battleship
and
even
as
it
did
so
the
mass
of
wreckage
suddenly
disappeared
from
sight
with
a
loud
noise
jack
shuddered
pretty
close
frank
he
said
quietly
you
can
see
what
would
have
happened
if
you
had
still
been
under
there
chapter
iv
athletics
can
you
fight
the
speaker
was
a
young
british
midshipman
jack
and
frank
stood
at
the
rail
gazing
off
toward
the
distant
horizon
when
the
young
man
approached
them
the
lads
turned
quickly
can
you
fight
demanded
the
young
man
again
his
eyes
rested
on
jack
well
said
the
latter
with
a
smile
i
can
if
i
pushed
to
it
who
wants
to
lick
me
now
the
young
midshipman
also
smiled
it
not
that
kind
of
a
fight
i
talking
about
he
said
you
new
aboard
so
i
explain
do
said
jack
well
there
has
been
considerable
rivalry
between
the
men
of
our
ship
and
the
crew
of
the
we
had
an
athletic
contest
last
year
and
they
beat
us
carrying
everything
but
the
standing
broad
jump
this
year
we
are
better
fortified
and
we
hope
to
get
even
among
other
things
there
will
be
a
boxing
match
jackson
that
the
man
we
had
entered
in
that
event
is
ill
i
have
been
elected
to
find
a
substitute
i
sized
you
up
as
being
able
to
hold
your
own
with
most
well
if
that
the
way
of
it
you
can
count
me
in
of
course
said
jack
when
does
this
come
off
as
soon
as
we
come
up
with
the
probably
tomorrow
what
other
events
are
there
asked
frank
plenty

the
reply
besides
the
boxing
match
and
standing
broad
jump

the
running
broad
jump
high
jumping
a
match
with
foils
and
a
revolver
contest

frank
i
believe
so
why
well
i
like
to
get
in
the
revolver
contest
replied
the
lad
pretty
handy
with
a
gun
i
see
what
can
be
done
returned
the
midshipman
by
the
way
my
name
is
lawrence
they
shook
hands
and
walked
off
well
that
something
to
liven
things
up
a
bit
said
frank
yes
but
i
did
know
they
were
doing
such
things
in
time
of
war
neither
did
i
but
it
seems
they
are
it
was
late
that
evening
when
lawrence
again
approached
the
two
lads
you
in
luck
he
said
to
frank
we
are
still
one
man
shy
on
our
revolver
team
i
have
named
you
for
the
place
thanks
said
frank
i
promise
to
do
the
best
i
can
by
the
way
where
is
this
match
to
take
place
right
here
last
year
it
was
pulled
off
on
the
it
was
drawing
toward
night
when
the
mary
steaming
swiftly
sighted
smoke
upon
the
horizon
two
hours
later
she
slowed
down
a
short
distance
from
three
other
vessels
which
proved
to
be
the
the
and
the
the
latter
the
flagship
of
beatty
the
commanders
exchanged
salutations
and
among
other
things
made
arrangements
for
the
athletic
contest
that
was
to
take
place
aboard

the
following
day
this
was
explained
to
the

when

informed
of
the
manner
in
which
the
events
were
to
be
pulled
off
hope
i
last
on
my
feet

said
jack
with
a
laugh

jack

said
frank
and
they
did
retiring
several
hours
after
mess
every
man
aboard
the
was
astir
bright
and
early
the
following
morning
each
man
was
filled
with
enthusiasm
and
each
was
ready
to
wager
his
next
year
pay
on
the
outcome
of
each
event
but
there
was
to
be
no
gambling
admiral
beatty
had
issued
orders
to
that
effect
at
eight
the
championship
entrants
from
the
came
aboard
accompanied
by
many
of
their
companions
who
would
be
present
to
cheer
them
on
officers
as
well
as
men
were
greatly
interested
in
the
day
sports
admiral
beatty
could
not
be
present
but
captain
reynolds
of
the
stood
by
captain
raleigh
of
the
as
the
first
event
was
called
we
going
to
get
even
with
you
this
time
reynolds
said
captain
raleigh
oh
no
you
wo
the
score
will
be
two
in
our
favor
after
today
they
became
silent
as
four
men
two
from
each
ship
made
ready
for
the
standing
broad
jump
the
jumping
was
superb
after
eight
attempts
one
man
from
each
ship
was
eliminated
and
at
length
the
man
won
two
points
for
us
raleigh
said
captain
reynolds
jotting
down
something
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
do
crow
we
get
you
yet
reynolds
was
captain
raleigh
reply
the
running
broad
jump
was
won
by
the
entrants
then
it
was
captain
raleigh
time
to
smile
told
you
so
he
said
to
captain
reynolds
oh
you
won
one
event
last
year
was
the
reply
this
high
jump
comes
to
us
and
it
did
the
score
was
now
four
to
two
in
favor
of
the
then
came
the
match
with
foils
and
this
also
went
to
the
making
the
score
nine
to
two
for
this
match
carried
five
points
for
the
winner
also
the
pistol
contest
and
the
boxing
match
carried
five
points
each
we
got
you
now
raleigh
laughed
captain
reynolds
nine
to
two
you
got
to
take
both
of
the
next
two
events
to
win
it
ca
be
done
it
has
been
done
was
the
reply
it
wo
be
this
time
was
the
reply
i
think
we
will
win
the
revolver
contest
for
i
have
some
pretty
fair
shots
but
if
we
do
we
are
sure
to
take
the
boxing
match
we
a
surprise
for
you
there
here
they
go
the
revolver
match
was
on
there
were
three
men
on
each
team
the
first
mark
was
set
a
target
at
twenty
yards
with
a
bull
eye
frank
fired
first
he
hit
the
bull
eye
easily
so
did
the
others
all
except
one
of
the
crew
who
was
thus
eliminated
much
to
his
disgust
as
the
spectators
jeered
him
the
next
shot
at
a
smaller
mark
eliminated
one
of
the
crew
an
man
and
a
man
both
missed
the
next
mark
and
there
remained
but
frank
for
the
and
a
man
named
simpson
for
the
the
target
had
been
removed
to
sixty
yards
and
the
bull
eye
was
but
two
inches
frank
fired
and
scored
a
hit
so
did
simpson
next
both
hit
the
mark
ten
yards
farther
back
a
bull
eye
was
substituted
frank
fired
first
he
scored
a
clean
hit
simpson
also
hit
the
eye
though
not
so
squarely
still
it
counted
a
hit
now
the
bull
eye
was
reduced
to
half
an
inch
and
at
seventy
yards
it
seemed
almost
impossible
to
hit
it
this
time
simpson
was
to
fire
first
carefully
he
took
deliberate
aim
and
fired
a
shout
went
up
from
the
men
who
stood
near
missed
it
by
a
hair
said
one
beat
it
chadwick
beat
it
he
ca
beat
it
hooray
we
won
this
from
the
crew
good
shooting
old
man
said
frank
quietly
as
he
took
his
position
carefully
he
measured
the
distance
with
his
eye
then
he
raised
his
revolver
slowly
and
seeming
scarcely
to
take
aim
fired
and
a
yell
went
up
from
the
crew
bull
eye
bull
eye
they
cried
and
danced
and
capered
about
the
deck
frank
had
won
he
had
hit
the
bull
eye
squarely
the
men
rushed
up
and
danced
about
him
good
work
they
cried
five
points
for
us
nine
to
seven
now
win
this
yet
simpson
approached
frank
and
extended
a
hand
good
shooting
son
he
exclaimed
simpson
was
a
man
well
along
in
years
and
he
put
this
touch
of
familiarity
to
his
words
to
make
frank
realize
that
they
were
sincere
i
used
to
be
something
of
a
shot
myself
he
said
but
i
guess
you
are
better
than
i
ever
was
frank
took
simpson
hand
you
would
probably
beat
me
next
time
he
said
simpson
shook
his
head
not
in
a
thousand
years
he
said
and
walked
off
meantime
captain
raleigh
and
captain
reynolds
were
having
it
out
told
you
so
told
you
so
exclaimed
the
former
as
pleased
as
a
boy
we
beat
you
yet
sure
no
you
wo
raleigh
said
reynolds
with
a
wink
i
tell
you
something
ever
hear
of
a
man
named
harris
yes
i
know
several
men
by
that
name
ever
hear
of
tim
harris
by
george
you
mean
tim
harris
of
the
the
same
the
champion
of
the
british
fleet
eh
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
have
rung
him
in
on
us
we
did
ring
him
in
was
the
reply
he
was
transferred
to
the
before
the
went
to
the
dardanelles
we
been
saving
this
up
as
a
little
surprise
captain
raleigh
had
lost
his
look
of
optimism
then
our
man
should
be
warned
he
said
he
may
wish
to
withdraw
it
is
only
fair
to
tell
him
who
his
opponent
is
agreed
captain
reynolds
i
guess
we
should
have
done
it
long
ago
i
tell
him
said
captain
raleigh
at
this
moment
there
was
a
loud
cheer
from
the
crew
of
the
here
he
comes
they
shouted
jack
stripped
to
the
waist
and
wearing
a
pair
of
trunks
had
appeared
on
deck
two
men
accompanied
him
these
it
seemed
were
to
be
his
seconds
jack
caught
sight
of
frank
and
smiled
and
again
the
crew
of
the
went
wild
chapter
v
the
fight
the
champion
of
the
had
not
yet
appeared
on
deck
and
the
crew
of
the
strained
their
necks
hunting
him
out
bring
out
your
champion
they
called
what
the
matter
with
him
is
he
afraid
the
men
of
the
returned
these
compliments
with
jeers
of
their
own
oh
just
wait
they
howled
captain
raleigh
in
the
meantime
had
approached
jack
and
his
seconds
it
is
only
fair
to
warn
you
he
said
quietly
that
the
man
whom
you
are
to
oppose
is
tim
harris
champion
of
the
british
fleet
jack
was
surprised
i
did
know
that
sir
i
thought
he
was
with
the
well
he
here
but
i
did
know
it
until
a
moment
ago
it
will
be
no
dishonor
to
you
if
you
wish
to
withdraw
a
man
must
be
in
perfect
trim
to
stand
before
harris
why
said
jack
in
surprise
i
can
hardly
do
that
now
sir
the
men
are
depending
on
me
captain
raleigh
smiled
frankly
you
are
all
right
boy
he
said
at
your
first
words
i
thought
you
were
afraid
but
you
can
not
hope
for
victory
i
always
hope
for
victory
sir
and
i
shall
do
my
best
i
am
no
novice
perhaps
not
but
harris
is
almost
a
professional
in
fact
i
may
say
a
good
deal
better
than
many
professionals
he
is
fast
for
a
man
of
his
size
and
has
a
terrible
punch
i
have
seen
him
box
often
if
you
are
decided
to
go
on
with
this
a
word
of
warning
watch
that
right
hand
of
his
like
you
would
a
hawk
i
shall
remember
sir
replied
jack
thank
you
all
right
then
said
captain
raleigh
i
like
your
spunk
good
luck
to
you
captain
raleigh
walked
back
to
captain
reynold
side
will
he
withdraw
asked
the
latter
he
will
not
he
says
the
men
are
depending
on
him
and
he
must
go
through
with
it
by
jove
a
fine
spirit
exclaimed
captain
reynolds
i
hope
he
is
not
too
easily
disposed
of
i
do
think
he
will
be
said
captain
raleigh
quietly
someway
i
have
a
feeling
that
you
have
carried
off
the
honors
yet
but
it
foolish
to
talk
like
that
raleigh
said
captain
reynolds
you
know
this
man
harris
i
suppose
it
is
foolish
but
it
the
way
i
feel
just
the
same
ah
there
harris
now
tim
harris
had
appeared
on
deck
and
the
crew
of
the
went
wild
now
for
the
first
time
the
crew
of
the
knew
who
jack
opponent
would
be
and
after
a
look
at
harris
they
became
strangely
silent
then
one
voice
called
never
mind
who
he
is
templeton
can
lick
him
anyhow
the
others
took
up
the
cry
and
jack
smiled
now
the
referee
called
the
principals
to
him
and
gave
them
their
instructions
no
hitting
in
clinches
and
clean
breaks
he
said
jack
and
harris
nodded
that
they
understood
as
the
two
stood
there
together
the
crowd
sized
them
up
jack
standing
well
above
six
feet
still
was
not
as
tall
as
his
opponent
who
topped
him
by
a
full
inch
their
arms
were
about
of
a
length
but
harris
was
big
through
the
chest
and
his
arms
seemed
more
powerful
than
jack
a
close
observer
however
would
have
seen
that
while
jack
was
in
perfect
physical
condition
harris
carried
a
trifle
too
much
fat
not
much
but
still
a
trifle
with
the
battle
anywhere
near
equal
this
fat
might
prove
to
jack
advantage
jack
arms
showed
strength
but
the
muscles
were
not
knotted
like
those
of
harris
harris
was
perhaps
years
old
jack
almost
ten
years
younger
jack
had
the
youth
but
harris
had
the
experience
of
many
hard
encounters
it
appeared
that
the
odds
were
heavily
against
jack
jack
and
harris
sized
each
other
carefully
jack
smiled
so
did
harris
as
they
touched
gloves
harris
said
you
a
nice
boy
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
too
much
so
i
make
this
short
the
referee
had
announced
that
the
match
was
to
be
for
ten
rounds
do
worry
about
me
said
jack
i
can
take
care
of
myself
if
the
match
is
short
you
wo
find
me
on
the
deck
harris
would
have
replied
but
at
that
moment
the
referee
called
time
jack
leaped
lightly
backward
even
as
harris
aimed
a
vicious
blow
at
his
head
apparently
trying
to
make
good
his
word
to
end
the
battle
at
once
the
blow
missed
jack
face
by
the
fraction
of
an
inch
harris
followed
up
this
blow
with
a
right
and
left
which
jack
blocked
neatly
and
then
brought
his
right
up
trying
to
upper
cut
jack
leaped
backward
and
the
blow
grazed
his
chin
before
harris
could
recover
jack
stepped
quickly
forward
and
planted
a
sharp
right
and
a
hard
left
to
harris
nose
harris
stepped
back
and
wiped
away
a
stream
of
red
it
was
first
blood
for
jack
and
the
crew
of
the
sent
up
a
wild
cheer
but
harris
only
smiled
he
was
not
to
be
caught
so
easily
again
these
two
blows
had
given
the
champion
some
respect
for
jack
ability
he
advanced
more
carefully
this
time
he
feinted
rapidly
and
shot
his
left
forward
quickly
followed
by
his
right
but
jack
had
not
been
deceived
and
caught
both
blows
upon
his
forearms
you
all
right
boy
said
harris
admiringly
it
a
pleasure
to
box
with
you
and
i
may
say
the
same
said
jack
they
fell
to
it
again
as
harris
stepped
quickly
forward
his
foot
slipped
and
he
fell
to
one
knee
hit
him
when
he
gets
up
came
a
cry
from
the
crowd
instead
jack
lowered
his
guard
and
extended
a
hand
he
helped
his
opponent
to
his
feet
then
he
stepped
back
and
the
battle
continued
now
jack
decided
that
he
would
feel
the
other
out
he
feinted
rapidly
once
twice
and
struck
out
with
a
right
and
he
staggered
back
suddenly
for
something
had
suddenly
come
up
under
his
chin
with
terrible
force
in
a
moment
jack
realized
what
was
it
was
harris
right
which
captain
raleigh
had
warned
him
against
had
the
blow
been
timed
perfectly
jack
realized
the
fight
would
have
been
over
then
and
there
guarding
desperately
jack
managed
to
fall
into
a
clinch
where
he
hung
on
until
his
head
cleared
as
he
stepped
back
the
referee
called
time
the
first
round
was
harris
by
the
margin
of
that
hard
uppercut
i
be
a
little
more
careful
of
that
right
jack
confided
to
his
seconds
as
he
again
advanced
into
the
ring
again
the
lad
assumed
the
offensive
keeping
careful
eye
on
his
opponent
right
fist
again
harris
tried
to
reach
jack
chin
but
this
time
jack
blocked
the
blow
he
knew
he
would
not
be
caught
that
way
again
jack
feinted
three
times
twice
with
his
left
and
once
with
his
right
and
then
the
right
crashed
against
harris
ear
the
man
staggered
back
and
before
he
could
recover
jack
planted
two
hard
blows
right
and
left
to
his
sore
nose
desperately
harris
rushed
into
a
clinch
again
the
crew
of
the
cheered
and
what
do
you
think
of
that
eh
asked
captain
raleigh
of
captain
reynolds
the
boy
is
a
fighter
was
the
latter
reply
but
wait
experience
will
tell
harris
became
more
cautious
he
circled
around
jack
lightly
dancing
about
on
his
toes
the
lad
followed
him
quietly
suddenly
harris
left
fist
shot
out
jack
blocked
but
before
he
could
recover
harris
launched
himself
like
a
catapult
and
a
series
of
right
and
lefts
descended
on
jack
face
neck
ears
and
abdomen
jack
staggered
back
and
harris
followed
him
closely
giving
him
no
rest
jack
was
still
retreating
at
the
bell
again
in
the
third
and
in
the
fourth
round
jack
seemed
to
be
getting
the
worst
of
it
in
the
fifth
he
braced
and
sent
in
as
good
as
he
received
in
the
sixth
he
almost
floored
harris
with
a
straight
right
to
the
side
of
the
jaw
and
in
the
seventh
harris
was
kept
on
the
defensive
but
in
the
eighth
jack
again
encountered
harris
right
and
the
force
of
the
blow
sent
him
reeling
all
through
the
round
harris
followed
up
this
advantage
and
at
the
bell
it
seemed
that
jack
would
be
unable
to
continue
the
fight
but
his
head
cleared
in
the
one
minute
rest
period
and
he
fought
through
the
ninth
round
carefully
the
lad
realized
now
that
so
far
harris
had
the
better
of
the
encounter
and
that
if
he
hoped
to
win
it
must
be
by
a
knockout
so
while
harris
was
trying
in
vain
to
put
in
a
finishing
punch
jack
husbanded
his
strength
determined
to
make
a
strong
effort
in
the
final
round
the
rest
refreshed
him
still
more
and
as
time
was
called
for
the
tenth
jack
cast
discretion
to
the
winds
and
leaped
forward
in
spite
of
this
he
was
cool
however
and
kept
his
eye
peeled
for
the
movement
that
would
tell
him
harris
was
about
to
launch
his
right
a
right
and
left
he
landed
to
harris
sore
nose
then
harris
rushed
jack
was
forced
back
around
the
ring
by
the
force
of
this
rush
and
backed
against
the
ropes
but
he
bounded
out
with
great
force
and
landed
a
vicious
left
to
the
side
of
harris
jaw
then
they
clinched
as
the
referee
parted
them
jack
saw
the
movement
for
which
he
had
been
watching
harris
again
was
about
to
launch
that
terrible
right
the
lad
waited
calmly
swish
it
flashed
forth
faster
than
the
eye
could
see
but
it
had
not
come
too
quick
for
jack
who
was
expecting
it
the
blow
was
aimed
for
the
point
of
the
chin
and
would
have
ended
the
fight
right
there
but
judging
the
distance
exactly
jack
moved
his
head
a
trifle
to
one
side
and
harris
fist
flashed
by
his
chin
by
the
fraction
of
an
inch
with
all
his
force
behind
the
blow
jack
put
a
straight
left
to
jaw
a
terrible
jolt
to
the
abdomen
followed
and
as
harris
head
came
forward
again
jack
pivoted
on
his
heel
and
struck
with
his
right
he
had
judged
the
time
and
the
distance
perfectly
his
right
fist
caught
harris
squarely
upon
the
point
of
the
chin
there
was
a
smack
that
could
be
heard
even
above
the
cheering
of
the
crew
followed
by
a
crash
as
harris
fell
to
the
deck
with
half
a
minute
of
the
last
round
to
go
jack
had
knocked
the
man
out
and
won
the
day
for
the
by
a
score
of
twelve
to
nine
and
the
crew
cheered
again
chapter
vi
scouting
harris
remained
prostrate
on
the
deck
quickly
jack
pulled
off
his
gloves
and
leaning
down
he
picked
up
the
unconscious
man
and
carried
him
to
his
own
cabin
there
he
bathed
the
man
face
and
brought
him
back
to
consciousness
how
do
you
feel
old
man
he
asked
harris
looked
at
the
lad
queerly
so
you
beat
me
eh
he
said
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
after
the
fifth
round
i
expected
it
i
am
no
match
for
you
and
i
know
it
do
you
realize
that
you
are
the
champion
of
the
british
fleet
now
i
had
thought
of
that
was
jack
reply
you
have
defeated
the
champion
so
your
title
is
undisputed
said
harris
he
rose
from
the
bunk
where
jack
had
placed
him
and
felt
tenderly
of
his
chin
quite
a
wallop
he
said
calmly
well
let
me
congratulate
you
i
am
glad
that
as
long
as
i
had
to
be
defeated
some
day
it
was
you
who
turned
the
trick
he
extended
a
hand
and
jack
grasped
it
heartily
you
would
probably
down
me
next
time
he
said
not
a
chance
replied
harris
i
know
when
i
have
met
my
superior
he
moved
toward
the
door
there
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
said
well
i
must
go
and
dress
now
i
hope
that
i
may
see
you
again
before
long
i
am
sure
i
hope
so
too
returned
jack
hardly
had
harris
taken
his
departure
when
running
feet
approached
jack
cabin
a
moment
later
a
crowd
of
sailors
burst
into
the
room
before
jack
realized
what
was
going
on
they
had
seized
him
hoisted
him
to
their
shoulders
and
rushed
out
on
deck
again
there
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
they
paraded
up
and
down
cheering
wildly
they
lowered
him
to
the
deck
however
when
captain
raleigh
and
captain
reynolds
approached
the
former
spoke
first
i
must
congratulate
you
upon
your
remarkable
exhibition
he
said
you
are
a
brave
boy
jack
flushed
and
hung
his
head
when
i
am
mistaken
i
admit
it
said
captain
reynolds
you
are
more
than
a
match
for
harris
at
any
time
i
did
the
best
i
could
said
jack
sheepishly
well
it
was
pretty
good
said
captain
reynolds
with
captain
raleigh
he
moved
away
frank
now
approached
and
accompanied
jack
back
to
their
cabin
where
jack
got
info
his
uniform
some
scrapper
you
are
said
frank
i
thought
you
were
done
for
once
or
twice
though
i
thought
so
myself
returned
jack
with
a
grin
i
was
pretty
lucky
in
that
last
round
if
you
ask
me
harris
was
pretty
unlucky
i
know
that
said
frank
grimly
hurry
up
it
time
to
eat
jack
fight
was
the
talk
of
the
day
aboard
the
and
aboard
the
too
for
that
matter
in
fact
all
the
british
fleet
within
wireless
radius
knew
before
night
that
there
was
a
new
champion
of
the
british
fleet
and
they
cheered
him
though
he
could
not
hear
it
was
upon
the
following
morning
while
the
steamed
about
in
the
north
sea
that
jack
and
frank
embarked
upon
their
first
piece
of
work
since
they
had
been
assigned
to
the
giant
battleship
both
lads
were
in
their
cabin
studying
when
an
orderly
announced
that
captain
raleigh
desired
their
presence
they
obeyed
the
summons
at
once
and
how
do
you
feel
today
asked
captain
raleigh
as
he
eyed
jack
quietly
first
rate
sir
feel
like
another
fight
no
sir
i
do
make
a
practice
of
that
sort
of
thing
i
glad
to
hear
that
how
would
you
like
to
take
a
little
trip
first
rate
sir
where
to
sir
well
that
rather
a
difficult
question
returned
captain
raleigh
here
read
this
and
he
passed
the
lad
a
slip
of
paper
jack
did
as
commanded
this
is
what
he
read
large
number
of
enemy
aircraft
reported
flying
over
north
sea
fifty
miles
south
of
you
every
night
investigate
signed
beatty
jack
passed
the
slip
of
paper
back
well
exclaimed
captain
raleigh
yes
sir
replied
jack
you
want
me
to
find
out
what
going
on
sir
exactly
can
you
run
a
hydroplane
no
sir
but
frank
here
can
who
lieutenant
chadwick
sir
oh
said
the
commander
so
he
is
frank
eh
all
right
then
here
is
what
i
want
you
two
to
do
take
the
hydroplane
aft
and
fly
south
take
your
time
and
see
what
you
can
find
out
the
matter
may
amount
to
nothing
and
then
again
it
may
forebode
something
serious
very
well
sir
replied
frank
when
shall
we
start
sir
you
may
as
well
start
immediately
it
is
hardly
possible
judging
by
the
tone
of
that
message
that
you
will
find
anything
by
daylight
but
at
least
you
can
be
on
the
ground
by
night
very
well
sir
said
jack
and
waited
to
see
if
there
were
any
further
instructions
captain
raleigh
dismissed
the
two
lads
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
that
is
all
he
said
report
the
moment
you
are
able
to
do
so
the
two
lads
saluted
and
returned
to
their
own
cabin
you
see
said
frank
we
did
have
to
wait
very
long
to
find
something
to
do
i
see
we
did
agreed
frank
now
the
first
thing
to
do
is
shed
these
uniforms
what
for
so
that
we
shall
not
be
taken
for
british
should
we
fall
among
the
enemy
we
put
on
plain
khaki
suits
well
whatever
you
say
said
frank
this
was
the
work
of
but
a
few
moments
and
half
an
hour
later
the
two
lads
soared
into
the
air
in
one
of
the
large
hydroplanes
this
is
something
like
it
if
you
ask
me
said
frank
as
he
bent
over
the
wheel
pretty
fine
jack
agreed
raising
his
voice
to
make
himself
heard
above
the
whir
of
the
propellers
and
the
noise
of
the
engine
i
would
mind
flying
all
the
time
where
do
we
want
to
come
down
jack
asked
frank
let
see
the
message
said
the
enemy
was
flying
about
fifty
miles
south
they
probably
wo
be
out
before
dark
so
i
should
say
it
might
be
well
to
go
a
little
beyond
that
point
all
right
but
we
may
miss
them
in
the
darkness
tonight
by
jove
that
so
funny
i
did
think
of
that
let
me
think
a
moment
no
use
of
thinking
said
frank
i
have
a
scheme
that
will
work
all
right
what
is
it
why
we
stop
right
in
the
path
taken
by
the
enemy
planes
and
then
drop
down
upon
the
water
so
the
germans
can
see
us
as
they
fly
by
eh
they
wo
see
us
in
the
dark
said
frank
we
be
a
pretty
small
spot
down
on
the
water
they
will
be
looking
for
nothing
so
small
i
guess
you
are
right
after
all
jack
agreed
at
least
it
worth
trying
we
be
sure
to
hear
them
flying
above
and
if
we
went
beyond
the
lane
of
travel
or
did
go
far
enough
we
might
not
even
see
them
exactly
said
frank
well
there
is
no
hurry
so
i
may
as
well
slow
down
a
bit
he
did
so
and
they
went
along
more
leisurely
ca
see
what
the
germans
would
be
flying
about
here
for
said
jack
and
i
have
been
trying
to
figure
it
out
ever
since
i
read
that
message
so
have
i
declared
frank
if
they
were
zeppelins
i
could
understand
it
they
would
be
going
and
returning
from
raids
on
the
british
coast
but
surely
they
would
not
venture
that
distance
with
aeroplanes
i
would
think
so
still
you
never
can
tell
about
those
fellows
they
do
a
lot
of
strange
things
so
they
do
say
frank
was
struck
with
a
sudden
thought
you
suppose
the
presence
of
many
of
those
fellows
heralds
the
advance
of
the
german
fleet
do
you
they
might
be
just
reconnoitering
you
know
no
i
hardly
think
that
could
be
it
the
germans
are
afraid
to
venture
out
they
know
they
get
licked
if
they
do
well
those
aeroplanes
come
out
every
night
for
some
purpose
sure
said
frank
it
a
wonder
to
me
the
germans
have
tried
to
sneak
out
in
great
force
before
now
they
could
come
along
here
without
any
trouble
or
they
could
make
the
effort
farther
north
say
near
jutland
well
i
suppose
they
try
it
some
day
said
jack
but
not
right
away
how
much
farther
do
we
have
to
go
frank
glanced
at
his
chart
and
then
at
his
speedometer
about
fifteen
miles
was
his
reply
and
then
we
be
there
too
soon
the
lad
was
right
it
was
not
three
when
the
hydroplane
came
to
the
spot
the
lads
had
selected
to
descend
well
here
we
are
said
frank
guess
we
may
as
well
go
down
then
said
jack
some
of
those
fellows
are
likely
to
be
prowling
about
and
spot
us
just
as
you
say
agreed
frank
he
set
the
planes
and
the
machine
glided
to
the
water
where
it
came
to
rest
lightly
glad
there
is
no
sun
said
jack
it
would
be
awfully
hot
down
here
and
there
the
lads
spent
the
afternoon
darkness
came
at
last
and
with
its
coming
the
lads
made
ready
for
whatever
might
occur
eight
came
and
there
had
been
no
sounds
of
airships
flying
above
the
lads
strained
their
ears
listening
for
the
slightest
sound
and
shortly
after
nine
their
efforts
were
rewarded
jack
suddenly
took
frank
by
the
arm
listen
he
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
chapter
vii
among
the
enemy
to
frank
ears
came
a
distant
whirring
to
ears
less
keen
than
the
lad
the
sound
which
came
from
above
might
have
been
some
bird
of
the
night
flapping
its
wings
as
it
soared
overhead
but
to
frank
and
jack
both
it
meant
something
entirely
different
it
was
the
sound
for
which
they
had
been
waiting
it
was
an
airship
through
his
night
glass
jack
scanned
the
clouds
and
at
last
he
picked
up
the
object
for
which
he
sought
almost
directly
overhead
at
that
moment
but
flying
rapidly
westward
was
a
single
aeroplane
so
high
in
the
air
was
the
machine
that
it
looked
a
mere
speck
and
jack
was
unable
to
determine
from
that
distance
whether
it
was
british
or
german
see
it
jack
asked
frank
in
a
low
voice
yes
was
the
reply
a
single
craft
perhaps
half
a
mile
up
no
more
in
sight
eh
not
yet
this
one
is
heading
west
guess
we
had
better
get
up
that
way
then
said
frank
jack
assented
a
moment
later
the
hydroplane
was
skimming
swiftly
over
the
water
for
perhaps
three
hundred
yards
frank
kept
the
craft
on
the
water
then
sent
it
soaring
into
the
air
above
there
was
not
a
word
between
the
two
boys
until
the
hydroplane
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
the
air
then
jack
said
make
your
elevation
half
a
mile
and
then
head
west
slowly
the
chances
are
there
will
be
more
of
them
in
the
darkness
we
can
let
them
overtake
us
and
mingle
with
them
in
safety
frank
gave
his
endorsement
to
this
plan
and
the
machine
continued
to
rise
at
the
proper
elevation
frank
turned
the
hydroplane
head
westward
and
reduced
the
speed
to
less
than
thirty
miles
an
hour
so
slow
was
its
gait
in
fact
that
it
had
the
appearance
of
almost
standing
still
jack
scanned
the
eastern
horizon
with
his
glass
see
anything
asked
frank
thought
i
did
was
the
reply
but
whatever
i
saw
has
disappeared
now
guess
i
must
have
been
mistaken
but
jack
had
not
been
mistaken
far
back
even
now
a
fleet
of
perhaps
a
dozen
german
air
planes
were
speeding
westward
for
the
most
part
they
were
small
craft
having
a
capacity
of
not
more
than
three
men
with
the
single
exception
of
one
machine
which
larger
than
the
rest
carried
four
men
the
air
planes
were
strung
out
for
considerable
distance
no
two
being
closer
than
two
hundred
yards
together
and
in
this
manner
they
overtook
the
hydroplane
driven
by
frank
and
jack
jack
again
surveying
the
horizon
with
his
night
glass
gave
an
exclamation
here
they
come
frank
he
said
let
her
out
a
little
more
frank
obeyed
without
question
and
the
speed
of
the
hydroplane
increased
from
something
more
than
thirty
miles
an
hour
to
almost
sixty
and
still
the
germans
gained
this
will
do
said
jack
leaning
close
to
frank
they
overtake
us
but
believing
we
are
of
their
number
there
is
little
likelihood
that
they
will
investigate
us
very
closely
we
can
fall
in
line
without
trouble
and
accompany
them
wherever
they
go
suits
me
said
frank
just
keep
me
posted
on
their
proximity
gradually
the
germans
reduced
the
distance
and
at
length
the
first
plane
was
only
a
few
yards
behind
the
craft
in
which
frank
and
jack
were
risking
their
lives
the
german
craft
flashed
by
a
moment
later
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
hydroplane
little
more
speed
frank
called
jack
the
hydroplane
skimmed
through
the
air
faster
than
before
and
the
next
german
craft
did
not
overtake
it
so
easily
but
at
length
it
passed
as
did
a
third
and
a
fourth
here
a
good
place
for
us
to
fall
in
line
jack
instructed
again
frank
increased
the
speed
of
the
hydroplane
and
it
moved
swiftly
in
the
wake
of
the
fourth
german
craft
after
that
no
enemy
air
plane
passed
them
any
idea
where
we
are
asked
frank
of
his
chum
we
not
far
off
the
belgian
coast
but
how
far
west
i
ca
say
returned
jack
do
suppose
it
makes
any
particular
difference
though
i
guess
not
frank
became
silent
and
gave
his
undivided
attention
to
keeping
the
german
plane
ahead
of
him
in
sight
and
in
this
manner
they
proceeded
for
perhaps
another
half
hour
then
the
machine
ahead
of
frank
veered
sharply
to
the
south
frank
brought
the
head
of
his
own
craft
in
the
same
direction
and
the
flight
continued
headed
for
the
belgian
or
french
coast
apparently
said
jack
to
himself
wonder
what
the
idea
is
now
the
craft
ahead
of
that
in
which
the
two
boys
rode
reduced
its
speed
abruptly
frank
cut
down
the
gait
of
his
own
craft
and
they
continued
on
their
way
more
slowly
nearing
our
destination
wherever
that
is
muttered
jack
the
lad
felt
of
his
revolvers
to
make
sure
that
they
were
ready
in
case
of
an
emergency
land
ahead
said
frank
suddenly
jack
gazed
straight
before
him
there
what
appeared
to
be
many
miles
away
though
in
reality
it
was
but
a
few
was
a
dark
blur
below
occasionally
what
appeared
to
be
little
stars
twinkled
there
jack
knew
they
were
the
lights
of
some
town
guess
that
where
we
are
headed
for
all
right
he
told
himself
behind
the
british
hydroplane
the
other
german
airships
came
rapidly
keeping
some
distance
apart
however
jack
leaned
close
to
frank
just
do
as
the
ones
ahead
of
you
do
he
said
quietly
i
do
know
where
we
are
nor
what
is
likely
to
happen
keep
your
nerve
and
we
be
all
right
do
worry
about
me
responded
frank
i
having
the
time
of
my
life
jack
smiled
to
himself
for
he
knew
that
frank
was
telling
the
truth
there
was
nothing
the
lad
liked
better
than
to
be
engaged
in
a
dangerous
piece
of
work
and
more
than
once
his
fondness
for
excitement
had
almost
ended
disastrously
frank
all
right
if
he
can
just
keep
his
head
muttered
jack
likely
to
have
to
hold
him
in
check
a
bit
though
they
had
approached
the
shore
close
enough
now
to
perceive
that
the
distant
lights
betokened
a
large
town
probably
ostend
jack
told
himself
though
why
they
should
come
this
way
is
too
deep
for
me
but
jack
was
wrong
as
he
learned
a
short
time
later
the
town
that
they
now
were
approaching
was
the
french
port
of
calais
and
it
was
still
held
by
the
french
despite
determined
efforts
of
the
germans
at
one
time
or
another
to
extend
their
lines
that
far
the
capture
of
calais
by
the
germans
would
have
been
a
severe
blow
to
england
for
with
the
french
seaport
in
their
possession
the
germans
with
their
great
guns
would
have
been
able
to
command
the
english
channel
and
a
considerable
portion
of
the
north
sea
coast
when
it
appeared
that
the
german
aircraft
would
fly
directly
over
the
city
the
leading
machine
suddenly
swerved
to
the
east
the
others
followed
suit
the
night
was
very
dark
and
in
spite
of
the
occasional
searchlight
that
was
flashed
into
the
air
by
the
french
in
calais
the
teuton
machines
so
far
had
been
undiscovered
now
hanging
low
over
the
land
a
sudden
bombardment
broke
out
from
the
german
air
planes
it
was
not
the
sound
of
bombs
that
came
to
the
lads
ears
rather
the
sharp
crack
crack
of
revolver
firing
jack
and
frank
gazed
about
them
quickly
for
they
believed
for
the
moment
that
the
germans
had
encountered
a
squadron
of
french
airships
but
there
was
no
other
machine
in
sight
save
the
german
craft
what
in
the
world
is
the
meaning
of
this
frank
asked
of
jack
do
know
returned
the
lad
but
i
guess
i
better
join
in
he
drew
his
revolver
and
fired
several
shots
in
the
air
seems
to
be
expected
of
us
he
said
we
do
want
to
disappoint
them
the
german
aircraft
now
headed
straight
for
the
city
of
calais
frank
sent
his
machine
speeding
in
the
same
direction
then
just
as
it
appeared
they
would
fly
directly
above
the
city
the
first
german
craft
began
to
descend
the
others
did
likewise
and
a
moment
or
so
later
they
all
came
to
earth
in
the
center
of
what
frank
and
jack
could
see
was
a
small
army
camp
and
as
they
alighted
from
their
machines
the
lads
saw
that
it
was
an
allied
camp
and
not
a
german
must
be
calais
said
frank
to
jack
in
a
whisper
have
we
been
mistaken
are
these
french
and
british
machines
well
it
looks
like
it
returned
jack
we
keep
quiet
and
let
the
other
fellows
do
the
talking
a
french
officer
now
approached
the
pilot
of
the
first
aircraft
we
heard
the
firing
aloft
a
moment
ago
he
said
did
you
encounter
the
enemy
we
were
pursued
all
the
way
from
the
german
lines
was
the
reply
anyone
hit
i
think
not
though
i
believe
we
accounted
for
one
or
two
of
the
enemy
good
will
you
fly
again
tonight
yes
but
not
before
midnight
the
french
officer
withdrew
at
this
one
of
the
aviators
raised
a
hand
and
the
others
gathered
about
him
frank
and
jack
with
them
all
wore
khaki
clothing
and
their
features
were
concealed
by
heavy
goggles
careful
whispered
the
aviator
a
false
move
and
we
are
discovered
spread
out
now
and
see
what
you
can
learn
gather
here
at
midnight
he
waved
a
hand
and
the
germans
for
such
jack
and
frank
now
knew
them
to
be
separated
when
the
two
lads
were
alone
a
moment
later
jack
said
well
this
is
what
i
call
a
piece
of
nervy
business
what
shall
we
do
inform
the
french
commander
immediately
no
i
have
a
better
plan
that
that
they
can
hardly
work
any
mischief
tonight
what
information
they
learn
will
avail
them
naught
for
we
can
warn
the
french
commander
later
we
must
find
out
what
they
are
up
to
we
stick
close
and
follow
them
back
to
the
german
lines
if
necessary
good
then
guess
we
had
better
do
a
little
skirmishing
about
it
will
keep
suspicion
from
us
should
we
be
watched
all
right
said
frank
come
on
chapter
viii
a
startling
discovery
with
the
coming
of
midnight
frank
and
jack
returned
to
the
spot
where
the
aeroplanes
had
been
parked
several
of
the
german
aviators
already
had
returned
the
man
who
appeared
to
be
the
leader
announced
that
they
would
await
the
arrival
of
the
others
before
taking
to
the
air
the
others
arrived
one
at
a
time
until
all
were
present
but
two
the
machines
were
in
readiness
to
ascend
the
moment
the
missing
men
arrived
the
aviators
were
at
their
posts
suddenly
there
came
a
shout
a
moment
later
the
two
german
aviators
who
were
delaying
the
departure
burst
into
sight
at
a
dead
run
quick
called
one
we
are
discovered
immediately
the
others
frank
and
jack
among
them
leaped
into
their
machines
and
soared
into
the
air
the
last
comers
also
leaped
for
their
craft
and
succeeded
in
getting
above
ground
just
as
rifles
began
to
crack
in
the
french
camp
came
a
sudden
cry
from
the
machine
nearest
that
of
frank
and
jack
the
lads
saw
a
man
rise
to
his
feet
throw
up
his
arms
and
pitch
head
foremost
toward
the
ground
the
aircraft
freed
of
a
guiding
hand
rocked
a
moment
crazily
and
then
turned
over
hurling
its
other
occupant
into
space
there
was
a
cry
of
anger
from
aboard
some
of
the
other
german
craft
but
no
man
raised
a
hand
to
stay
the
flight
of
his
car
it
would
have
been
suicide
and
the
germans
realized
it
they
sped
away
into
the
darkness
whence
they
had
come
frank
and
jack
in
their
british
hydroplane
went
with
them
for
an
hour
or
two
the
aeroplanes
sped
through
the
darkness
at
undiminished
speed
then
the
foremost
craft
slowed
down
the
others
did
likewise
surely
we
have
reached
the
german
lines
already
said
jack
frank
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
know
about
as
much
of
what
is
going
on
as
i
do
he
returned
evidently
we
are
going
down
however
the
lad
was
right
the
leading
german
plane
swooped
toward
the
earth
and
the
others
followed
its
example
a
few
minutes
later
all
had
reached
the
ground
safely
and
their
occupants
had
alighted
the
two
lads
glanced
around
it
was
very
dark
a
short
distance
to
the
north
they
could
see
the
broad
expanse
of
the
north
sea
stretching
away
in
the
night
the
dark
waves
lapped
the
shore
gently
with
a
faint
thrashing
sound
the
water
was
very
calm
except
for
the
figures
that
had
alighted
upon
the
shore
in
the
darkness
there
was
not
a
human
being
in
sight
to
the
south
to
the
east
and
west
stretched
miles
and
miles
of
sand
dunes
just
these
sand
dunes
and
the
waters
of
the
north
sea
there
was
nothing
else
in
sight
at
a
signal
the
men
gathered
around
the
man
who
appeared
to
be
the
leader
frank
and
jack
thanked
their
lucky
stars
that
the
night
was
very
dark
for
otherwise
they
would
have
been
in
imminent
danger
of
being
discovered
and
each
lad
realized
that
it
would
go
hard
with
them
should
their
true
identities
be
penetrated
the
darkness
served
them
like
a
shield
nevertheless
both
lads
kept
their
hands
on
their
revolvers
each
had
determined
that
if
discovered
he
would
make
an
effort
to
escape
in
the
nearest
of
the
aircraft
each
knew
that
there
was
little
hope
of
such
an
escape
but
realizing
what
was
in
store
for
them
should
they
be
discovered
and
captured
they
had
decided
it
would
be
better
to
die
fighting
than
to
be
stood
up
against
a
wall
and
shot
or
possibly
hanged
the
group
of
men
on
the
bench
became
silent
as
the
leader
addressed
them
men
he
said
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
we
have
discovered
so
soon
there
was
still
work
to
be
done
before
the
hour
for
our
great
effort
to
crush
the
british
fleet
however
to
a
certain
extent
we
have
been
successful
we
have
managed
to
sow
the
seed
of
suspicion
in
the
minds
of
our
enemies
prisoners
whom
we
have
allowed
to
be
taken
have
let
slip
words
that
will
lead
the
british
to
think
our
fleet
will
slip
from
its
base
and
approach
england
from
the
south
we
know
better
than
that
we
know
that
on
the
night
of
may
which
is
tomorrow
our
fleet
will
strike
the
british
off
jutland
there
was
a
subdued
cheer
from
the
assembled
germans
the
speaker
continued
through
our
efforts
the
british
fleet
has
been
scattered
the
main
portion
of
the
fleet
lies
to
the
south
and
will
be
unable
to
reach
jutland
in
time
to
save
the
portion
of
the
british
fleet
there
from
destruction
of
course
should
wind
of
the
move
reach
the
british
there
would
still
be
time
for
the
fleet
to
gather
but
no
such
word
will
reach
the
enemy
after
sinking
the
first
section
of
the
british
fleet
our
vessels
will
steam
south
and
meet
the
main
british
fleet
the
numbers
will
be
nearer
equal
then
we
shall
be
victorious
again
there
was
a
subdued
cheer
in
which
frank
and
jack
joined
for
the
sake
of
appearances
again
the
speaker
continued
i
shall
now
explain
the
reason
we
have
landed
here
our
part
in
the
work
has
been
done
here
we
shall
remain
until
nightfall
tomorrow
we
shall
then
sail
north
and
take
part
in
the
battle
in
my
pocket
here
he
tapped
the
breast
of
his
coat
are
instructions
i
shall
read
to
you
before
we
leave
until
that
time
we
shall
rest
here
for
we
have
done
work
enough
for
the
present
we
shall
be
safe
here
our
position
now
is
directly
between
two
french
lines
and
for
that
reason
we
shall
not
be
disturbed
of
course
if
it
becomes
necessary
we
can
take
to
our
machines
and
get
out
of
harm
way
we
have
provisions
and
water
enough
to
last
us
and
while
the
weather
is
warm
it
is
still
cool
enough
at
any
rate
we
shall
have
to
make
the
best
of
it
the
man
ceased
speaking
and
beckoned
the
others
to
follow
him
he
walked
a
hundred
yards
to
the
east
there
he
made
a
mark
in
the
sand
with
his
foot
until
the
time
for
us
to
move
has
come
he
said
let
no
man
set
foot
beyond
that
line
i
make
this
rule
for
safety
sake
he
walked
two
hundred
yards
from
the
sea
itself
and
repeated
the
operation
and
instructions
and
then
to
the
west
within
these
bounds
he
said
we
will
spend
tonight
and
tomorrow
the
man
who
disobeys
these
instructions
shall
be
shot
do
i
make
myself
plain
there
was
a
murmur
of
assent
very
well
said
the
leader
now
you
are
all
left
to
your
own
devices
first
however
i
shall
pick
the
watches
for
the
night
frank
and
jack
at
this
slunk
well
back
into
the
crowd
for
they
did
not
wish
to
be
scrutinized
closely
but
they
need
have
had
no
fear
the
leader
of
the
germans
laid
a
hand
on
the
shoulders
of
the
two
men
nearest
him
you
two
he
said
shall
stand
guard
the
remainder
of
the
night
one
to
the
southeast
and
one
to
the
southwest
but
do
not
venture
beyond
the
boundaries
i
have
laid
down
the
germans
saluted
and
moved
away
the
leader
moved
toward
the
sea
and
none
of
the
others
followed
him
instead
some
walked
a
short
distance
to
the
east
others
to
the
south
and
still
others
to
the
west
they
threw
themselves
down
in
the
sand
a
few
remained
near
the
airships
frank
and
jack
walked
a
short
distance
toward
the
sea
but
kept
some
distance
behind
the
german
leader
who
stood
looking
off
across
the
water
apparently
deep
in
thought
the
lads
sat
down
upon
the
ground
well
said
frank
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
do
echoed
jack
why
there
is
only
one
thing
we
can
do
one
thing
we
must
do
we
must
get
away
from
here
and
warn
the
fleet
all
right
said
frank
it
sounds
easy
but
how
well
that
does
make
any
difference
we
got
to
do
it
and
the
moment
we
have
gone
our
absence
will
be
discovered
the
germans
will
know
the
fleet
has
been
warned
and
the
attack
will
be
given
up
said
frank
and
we
do
want
anything
like
that
to
happen
it
will
be
the
first
time
the
germans
have
mustered
up
courage
enough
to
come
out
and
give
battle
we
do
want
to
frighten
them
off
we
do
want
to
let
them
sneak
up
on
a
part
of
our
fleet
unguarded
either
declared
jack
of
course
not
you
say
we
must
give
the
warning
we
try
of
course
but
first
why
not
let
put
all
the
aeroplanes
except
the
one
we
want
out
of
commission
by
jove
a
good
plan
we
do
it
exactly
said
frank
then
there
is
still
another
thing
what
is
that
why
we
want
the
instructions
that
fellow
carries
and
frank
waved
a
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
german
leader
he
was
kind
enough
to
let
us
know
he
has
them
we
have
to
take
them
away
from
him
say
exclaimed
jack
you
laid
out
quite
a
job
for
us
you
it
got
to
be
done
declared
frank
well
all
right
but
we
shall
have
to
be
careful
right
you
are
frank
agreed
one
little
slip
and
the
whole
thing
will
be
spoiled
then
there
must
be
no
slip
said
jack
quietly
i
agree
with
you
there
now
the
question
arise
as
how
the
thing
may
best
be
done
we
have
to
wait
until
they
all
asleep
said
jack
you
forget
the
sentinels
wo
sleep
said
frank
no
i
do
and
they
will
be
the
first
disposed
of
they
are
not
looking
for
enemies
from
within
you
know
you
walk
up
to
one
and
walk
up
to
the
other
we
be
challenged
when
we
get
close
of
course
then
it
will
be
up
to
us
to
silence
those
fellows
before
they
can
make
an
outcry
we
try
it
then
what
then
we
come
back
and
put
the
airships
out
of
commission
as
carefully
as
possible
that
easy
enough
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
let
out
the
next
we
have
to
go
through
the
commander
pockets
without
arousing
him
that
more
difficult
but
i
suppose
it
can
be
done
next
we
have
to
get
our
hydroplane
to
the
water
fortunately
we
came
down
closer
to
the
sea
than
the
others
we
should
be
able
to
do
that
without
awakening
the
sleepers
then
said
frank
we
climb
in
and
say
goodbye
eh
that
it
all
right
we
work
it
that
way
then
it
as
good
as
any
other
now
we
keep
quiet
until
we
are
sure
everyone
is
asleep
their
plans
thus
arranged
the
lads
became
quiet
they
said
not
a
word
as
they
waited
for
sleep
to
overcome
the
germans
but
gazed
out
quietly
over
the
dark
sea
chapter
ix
the
plan
works
almost
time
to
get
busy
it
was
frank
who
spoke
all
was
quiet
among
the
sand
dunes
the
commander
of
the
germans
had
laid
down
upon
the
ground
some
distance
from
the
others
half
an
hour
before
snores
from
various
points
announced
that
most
of
the
men
were
sleeping
soundly
jack
and
frank
got
to
their
feet
careful
said
jack
as
they
separated
remember
do
give
your
man
a
chance
to
let
out
a
cry
frank
nodded
in
the
darkness
and
walked
slowly
toward
the
sentinel
he
had
selected
to
silence
jack
moved
in
the
other
direction
as
jack
came
within
a
few
yards
of
his
prey
the
man
raised
his
rifle
and
commanded
halt
it
all
right
said
jack
i
could
sleep
and
it
was
lonesome
back
there
i
want
company
the
german
lowered
his
rifle
it
lonesome
here
too
he
said
wish
you
had
been
selected
for
my
job
i
would
have
minded
it
tonight
said
jack
approaching
closer
the
german
reached
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
pack
of
cigarettes
he
extended
the
pack
to
jack
have
one
he
invited
jack
accepted
a
cigarette
the
german
produced
a
match
he
laid
his
rifle
upon
the
ground
as
he
struck
the
match
upon
the
leg
of
his
trousers
it
was
the
moment
for
which
jack
had
been
waiting
quickly
his
revolver
leaped
out
in
almost
the
same
instant
he
reversed
it
and
before
the
german
realized
what
was
about
to
happen
he
brought
the
butt
down
on
the
man
head
with
great
force
the
man
fell
to
the
ground
without
a
sound
frank
advancing
upon
the
other
german
also
was
challenged
when
he
drew
close
but
he
too
engaged
his
prey
in
conversation
as
the
man
turned
his
head
for
a
moment
to
gaze
across
the
dark
sand
the
lad
struck
him
violently
over
the
head
with
his
revolver
butt
the
german
dropped
like
a
log
a
few
moments
later
frank
and
jack
met
again
near
the
first
aeroplane
it
have
to
be
quick
work
here
jack
warned
we
have
a
whole
lot
of
time
you
know
frank
nodded
that
he
understood
rapidly
they
passed
from
one
plane
to
another
letting
out
the
gasoline
five
minutes
later
with
the
exception
of
their
hydroplane
which
rested
some
distance
away
every
craft
upon
the
beach
was
dry
they
were
absolutely
useless
or
so
the
lads
thought
now
for
the
papers
said
jack
as
he
straightened
up
after
tinkering
with
the
last
machine
cautiously
the
two
lads
advanced
upon
the
sleeping
german
frank
raised
his
revolver
and
would
have
brought
it
down
on
the
man
head
had
not
jack
stayed
him
with
a
gesture
no
need
of
that
he
said
i
do
like
to
hurt
a
man
except
when
it
is
absolutely
necessary
frank
put
the
revolver
back
in
his
pocket
gently
jack
thrust
his
hand
into
the
german
pocket
he
fumbled
about
a
moment
and
then
drew
forth
a
paper
turning
his
head
aside
he
struck
a
match
and
glanced
at
the
paper
then
he
nodded
his
satisfaction
this
is
it
he
said
frank
at
that
moment
had
risen
to
his
feet
believing
the
work
was
accomplished
he
was
moving
off
toward
the
hydroplane
as
jack
now
made
to
get
to
his
feet
he
chanced
to
glance
at
the
german
he
had
just
relieved
of
the
papers
the
lad
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
no
wonder
the
eyes
were
open
and
gazed
straight
at
jack
in
his
hand
he
held
a
revolver
and
it
was
levelled
at
jack
head
hands
up
said
the
german
quietly
there
was
nothing
for
jack
to
do
but
obey
or
be
shot
his
hands
went
high
in
the
air
but
he
still
retained
the
valuable
papers
drop
those
papers
was
the
next
command
jack
obeyed
and
the
papers
fluttered
to
his
feet
the
german
reached
out
and
picked
them
up
with
his
left
hand
while
with
his
right
he
still
covered
the
lad
with
his
revolver
so
you
a
spy
eh
said
the
german
jack
made
no
reply
but
a
gleam
of
hope
lighted
up
his
eye
for
frank
chancing
to
turn
for
some
unexplainable
reason
had
taken
in
the
situation
and
was
now
advancing
on
tiptoe
to
his
friend
aid
how
did
you
get
here
demanded
the
german
making
ready
to
rise
again
jack
made
no
reply
but
none
was
necessary
for
at
that
moment
frank
had
come
within
striking
distance
his
arm
rose
and
fell
and
as
his
revolver
butt
descended
upon
the
german
head
the
latter
toppled
over
in
a
heap
quickly
jack
stooped
and
again
recovered
the
papers
he
had
taken
so
much
pains
to
get
come
on
cried
frank
we
have
time
to
fool
around
here
the
rest
of
this
crowd
is
likely
to
wake
up
in
a
minute
or
two
jack
followed
his
friend
across
the
sand
they
laid
hold
of
the
hydroplane
and
rolled
it
toward
the
water
in
it
went
with
a
splash
and
frank
cried
climb
aboard
quickly
jack
needed
no
urging
and
a
moment
later
the
two
boys
were
ready
for
flight
and
then
suddenly
there
was
the
crack
of
a
revolver
behind
them
and
a
bullet
flew
close
to
jack
ear
the
german
leader
had
recovered
consciousness
and
springing
to
his
feet
dashed
to
the
water
edge
and
fired
point
blank
at
the
machine
fortunately
in
his
excitement
his
aim
was
poor
and
he
missed
before
he
could
fire
again
frank
wheeled
about
and
his
revolver
spoke
sharply
the
german
threw
up
his
arms
and
with
a
gasp
pitched
headlong
into
the
sea
but
the
sounds
of
the
two
shots
had
aroused
the
sleeping
camp
wild
cries
came
from
the
shore
followed
by
heavy
footfalls
as
the
germans
rushed
toward
the
water
hurry
frank
cried
jack
as
lightly
as
a
fairy
the
hydroplane
skimmed
over
the
water
then
went
soaring
in
the
air
frank
gave
a
loud
cheer
safe
he
exclaimed
but
the
lad
was
wrong
from
on
shore
came
a
chorus
of
angry
cries
and
imprecations
hastily
the
germans
made
a
rush
for
their
aeroplanes
to
give
chase
none
would
move
followed
more
cries
and
angry
shouts
wait
said
one
german
i
some
gasoline
rapidly
he
opened
up
a
big
can
which
he
took
from
the
bottom
of
his
machine
quickly
the
tank
was
filled
and
the
man
climbed
into
the
pilot
seat
another
jumped
in
with
him
give
us
some
of
that
gasoline
cried
another
the
german
shook
his
head
not
enough
he
replied
we
overtake
those
fellows
and
then
come
back
for
the
rest
of
you
the
aeroplane
leaped
skyward
and
started
in
pursuit
of
frank
and
jack
the
two
boys
believing
that
they
were
safe
were
going
along
only
at
a
fair
rate
of
speed
when
jack
keen
ears
caught
the
sound
of
the
pursuing
machine
they
after
us
frank
he
called
impossible
replied
frank
how
can
they
fly
without
gas
well
they
coming
all
the
same
declared
jack
he
produced
his
two
revolvers
and
examined
them
carefully
you
run
this
thing
and
i
do
what
fighting
is
necessary
he
said
wish
i
could
shoot
like
you
can
but
i
ca
and
i
ca
run
this
machine
either
the
german
aeroplane
was
gaining
steadily
he
can
outrun
us
said
frank
quietly
there
is
only
one
thank
goodness
you
have
to
bring
him
down
jack
i
try
was
jack
reply
if
i
had
a
rifle
i
might
be
able
to
pick
him
off
now
well
he
wo
hardly
have
any
the
best
of
it
said
frank
the
chances
are
he
has
no
rifle
either
frank
was
correct
in
this
surmise
rapidly
the
german
aircraft
gained
crack
the
german
had
fired
the
first
shot
it
went
wild
jack
fired
but
with
no
better
result
hit
anything
asked
frank
without
turning
his
head
no
said
jack
but
neither
did
the
other
fellow
try
it
again
said
frank
jack
did
so
but
again
the
bullet
went
wild
all
this
time
the
two
craft
were
flying
straight
out
to
sea
once
more
the
german
fired
and
jack
felt
something
whizz
overhead
this
is
getting
too
close
the
lad
muttered
to
himself
then
he
called
to
frank
slow
down
quick
frank
had
no
means
of
telling
what
plan
jack
had
in
mind
but
he
did
not
hesitate
the
hydroplane
slowed
down
with
a
jerk
the
pilot
of
the
german
craft
was
caught
off
his
guard
he
dashed
upon
the
hydroplane
but
as
he
neared
it
he
swerved
to
the
left
to
avoid
a
collision
it
was
what
jack
had
expected
standing
up
in
his
precarious
position
jack
took
a
snap
shot
at
the
pilot
as
the
german
craft
swept
by
at
that
close
distance
in
spite
of
the
rate
of
speed
at
which
the
enemy
was
travelling
a
miss
was
practically
impossible
the
german
machine
swayed
crazily
from
one
side
to
the
other
then
dived
i
got
him
frank
shouted
jack
both
lads
gazed
over
the
side
at
the
falling
enemy
suddenly
the
machine
righted
and
descended
more
slowly
by
jove
a
cool
customer
said
frank
he
regained
control
of
the
plane
he
be
up
again
in
a
moment
again
they
watched
the
foe
carefully
no
he
wo
said
jack
he
still
going
down
then
we
may
as
well
be
moving
said
frank
hold
on
shouted
jack
we
ca
leave
those
fellows
there
they
may
get
to
shore
or
be
picked
up
then
they
would
give
the
warning
and
all
our
efforts
would
be
for
naught
right
said
frank
we
go
down
after
them
the
hydroplane
descended
slowly
chapter
x
the
fight
on
the
water
below
the
fallen
aeroplane
rested
upon
the
surface
of
the
sea
in
the
darkness
it
was
hard
for
the
lads
to
tell
just
how
badly
the
craft
was
damaged
and
whether
it
would
float
but
jack
idea
was
to
be
on
the
safe
side
while
still
some
distance
from
the
water
there
was
a
shot
from
below
hello
said
jack
they
alive
and
kicking
all
right
wonder
if
we
ca
go
down
and
get
them
from
the
water
it
a
better
plan
i
guess
said
frank
we
have
an
even
break
then
this
way
they
have
all
the
advantage
he
opened
up
the
engine
and
the
hydroplane
ran
some
distance
from
the
position
of
the
men
below
then
he
shut
off
the
motor
and
allowed
the
plane
to
glide
down
to
the
sea
with
the
craft
riding
the
swell
of
the
waves
jack
picked
up
the
enemy
with
his
night
glass
the
disabled
craft
also
was
riding
the
waves
gently
perhaps
five
hundred
yards
away
jack
gave
the
position
to
frank
and
the
hydroplane
approached
the
foe
slowly
within
a
range
that
would
make
accurate
revolver
shooting
possible
the
hydroplane
came
to
a
halt
as
it
did
so
there
was
the
sound
of
a
revolver
shot
from
across
the
water
and
something
whizzed
overhead
must
have
some
pretty
fair
shooters
over
there
said
frank
quietly
however
they
ca
see
us
any
better
than
we
can
see
them
of
course
they
can
see
our
craft
all
right
the
same
as
we
can
see
theirs
but
they
ca
spot
us
no
nor
we
ca
spot
them
which
makes
it
worse
said
jack
we
try
a
couple
of
shots
for
luck
said
frank
he
raised
his
revolver
and
fired
quickly
twice
his
efforts
were
rewarded
by
a
scream
apparently
of
pain
must
have
hit
one
of
them
he
said
grimly
again
a
revolver
across
the
water
flashed
and
the
two
lads
heard
a
bullet
whistle
by
jack
fired
but
without
result
and
then
frank
fired
again
there
was
another
scream
either
got
the
other
one
or
the
same
one
again
said
frank
they
waited
some
moments
in
silence
but
no
further
shots
came
from
the
foe
by
jove
said
jack
you
must
have
got
them
both
let
go
and
have
a
look
slowly
frank
started
the
hydroplane
and
they
bore
down
on
the
enemy
now
they
were
two
hundred
then
one
hundred
yards
away
must
have
got
them
all
right
said
frank
i
the
flash
of
a
revolver
from
the
disabled
craft
interrupted
him
it
was
closely
followed
by
another
and
then
two
more
with
a
sudden
move
frank
changed
the
course
of
the
hydroplane
he
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
his
left
shoulder
got
me
he
called
to
jack
the
latter
was
alarmed
where
he
demanded
left
shoulder
said
frank
quietly
nothing
serious
though
jack
levelled
his
revolver
and
fired
rapidly
at
the
enemy
his
pains
were
rewarded
by
howls
of
derision
they
tricked
us
all
right
said
jack
as
he
reloaded
that
what
they
did
i
should
have
known
better
too
they
almost
settled
us
we
got
to
get
them
some
way
declared
jack
show
me
how
and
i
go
along
with
you
declared
frank
well
i
got
a
scheme
but
i
do
know
whether
it
will
work
or
not
let
hear
it
all
right
but
first
can
you
manage
this
plane
all
right
with
that
bad
shoulder
sure
it
not
very
bad
all
right
then
well
you
keep
under
cover
about
here
moving
about
just
enough
to
spoil
the
aim
of
the
foe
i
drop
over
the
side
and
swim
to
the
enemy
i
can
get
there
unobserved
all
right
because
they
wo
be
expecting
me
i
pull
one
of
them
over
and
settle
with
him
first
then
i
get
the
other
i
do
know
frank
considered
the
plan
i
suppose
it
might
work
but
there
is
nothing
sure
about
it
there
nothing
sure
about
anything
declared
jack
but
it
better
than
staying
here
all
the
rest
of
the
night
besides
we
must
hurry
you
know
that
right
agreed
frank
all
right
then
so
be
it
will
you
take
your
gun
no
use
said
jack
it
would
be
wet
by
the
time
i
got
there
here
i
go
good
luck
frank
called
after
him
gently
jack
lowered
himself
over
the
side
of
the
hydroplane
first
divesting
himself
of
his
coat
and
shoes
then
struck
out
for
the
disabled
aeroplane
slowly
the
lad
swam
for
he
did
not
wish
to
betray
his
coming
by
the
sound
of
a
splash
the
distance
was
not
great
and
a
powerful
swimmer
such
as
jack
could
cover
it
easily
in
a
few
moments
jack
did
not
approach
the
enemy
craft
from
the
front
giving
it
a
wide
berth
he
swam
around
it
and
then
turning
quickly
bore
down
upon
the
aeroplane
more
swiftly
he
swam
with
his
head
barely
above
the
water
and
he
was
ready
to
dive
immediately
should
he
be
sighted
there
was
not
a
sound
aboard
the
aeroplane
as
jack
drew
close
to
it
raising
his
head
slightly
he
could
see
no
human
form
funny
the
lad
muttered
to
himself
wonder
where
they
keep
themselves
no
wonder
we
could
hit
them
he
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
disabled
craft
and
he
now
rose
higher
in
the
water
to
get
a
good
look
about
still
he
saw
no
one
twice
around
the
machine
the
lad
swam
and
not
a
human
being
did
he
see
there
is
something
awfully
queer
about
this
he
told
himself
go
aboard
he
laid
hands
on
the
aeroplane
and
scrambled
aboard
quickly
he
sprang
to
his
feet
ready
to
tackle
any
foe
that
might
have
seen
him
crawl
aboard
nothing
happened
jack
made
a
careful
inspection
of
the
disabled
plane
then
as
he
still
gazed
around
a
sudden
thought
struck
him
without
taking
time
to
consider
it
he
sprang
suddenly
to
the
side
of
the
plane
and
leaped
into
the
water
and
with
swift
and
powerful
strokes
struck
out
for
his
own
craft
jack
had
hit
upon
the
solution
of
the
desertion
of
the
german
aeroplane
even
as
jack
had
lowered
himself
from
the
hydroplane
and
swam
across
the
water
the
germans
in
the
other
craft
had
done
the
same
thing
both
sides
had
struck
the
same
plan
almost
simultaneously
jack
in
making
a
wide
detour
as
he
approached
the
foes
machine
must
have
passed
the
two
germans
in
the
water
now
realizing
that
the
germans
must
be
close
to
the
hydroplane
had
they
not
already
reached
it
and
remembering
that
frank
was
wounded
jack
felt
a
sudden
dread
steal
over
him
his
long
powerful
strokes
sent
him
through
the
water
at
great
speed
but
the
germans
had
not
made
their
presence
known
to
frank
yet
neither
was
as
swift
a
swimmer
as
jack
and
for
that
reason
their
progress
through
the
water
had
been
considerably
slower
also
they
had
gone
very
cautiously
a
short
distance
from
the
hydroplane
one
had
swum
to
one
side
of
the
plane
and
the
second
to
the
other
the
germans
also
had
discarded
their
revolvers
for
they
had
realized
they
would
be
useless
after
their
trip
through
the
water
also
not
being
expert
swimmers
they
had
wanted
to
be
unhampered
by
weight
as
much
as
possible
frank
was
still
guiding
the
plane
about
occasionally
to
avoid
a
chance
bullet
from
the
enemy
but
at
the
moment
the
germans
came
close
he
had
stopped
the
craft
and
was
peering
into
the
darkness
straining
his
ears
for
the
sound
of
a
struggle
that
would
tell
him
jack
was
engaged
with
the
enemy
suddenly
a
sound
came
to
his
ears
from
across
the
water
but
it
was
not
what
he
expected
although
it
was
in
jack
voice
frank
look
out
they
are
after
you
instantly
the
lad
understood
the
situation
he
drew
his
revolver
with
his
uninjured
arm
and
sprang
to
one
side
of
the
aeroplane
as
he
did
so
a
figure
reached
up
and
grabbed
him
by
the
hand
so
that
he
could
not
fire
at
the
same
time
a
second
figure
clambered
aboard
the
craft
from
the
opposite
side
frank
raised
a
cry
hurry
jack
jack
needed
no
urging
he
was
swimming
through
the
water
as
fast
as
possible
with
a
sudden
move
frank
jerked
his
hand
loose
from
the
grip
that
held
him
and
turned
just
in
time
to
encounter
the
second
german
frank
raised
his
revolver
and
fired
quickly
but
the
german
ducked
and
before
frank
could
fire
again
he
had
come
up
close
to
frank
and
grappled
with
him
in
vain
frank
sought
to
release
his
arm
so
that
he
could
bring
the
weapon
down
on
his
opponent
head
the
man
clung
tightly
a
sudden
lurching
of
the
hydroplane
told
frank
that
the
second
german
was
coming
aboard
unmindful
of
his
wounded
shoulder
frank
struggled
on
with
a
sharp
kick
of
his
right
foot
he
succeeded
in
knocking
the
first
german
legs
from
beneath
him
and
again
the
lad
tried
to
raise
his
revolver
to
shoot
the
second
german
who
now
advanced
but
the
latter
was
too
quick
for
him
closing
with
the
lad
the
man
knocked
the
revolver
from
the
boy
hand
with
a
quick
blow
the
weapon
spun
into
the
sea
the
first
german
returned
to
the
attack
get
him
quick
he
shouted
there
is
another
one
around
here
some
place
jack
at
this
moment
was
within
a
few
yards
of
the
boat
you
bet
there
is
he
said
between
his
teeth
and
he
be
there
in
a
minute
he
did
not
call
encouragement
to
frank
for
he
wished
to
get
aboard
the
plane
if
possible
before
the
men
could
stay
him
the
two
germans
rushed
frank
simultaneously
and
bore
him
back
in
the
plane
at
the
same
instant
jack
unmindful
of
danger
that
might
lurk
aboard
and
thinking
only
of
frank
danger
laid
hold
of
the
plane
and
climbed
aboard
then
he
stood
erect
and
shouted
come
on
you
cowards
here
the
other
one
chapter
xi
dawn
and
a
new
enemy
the
two
germans
just
about
to
throw
frank
overboard
turned
quickly
at
the
sound
of
this
new
voice
they
wasted
no
time
at
him
cried
one
and
leaped
the
other
sprang
after
him
jack
with
his
feet
wide
apart
and
arms
extended
braced
himself
to
receive
the
shock
and
when
it
came
he
was
ready
frank
in
the
meantime
sank
down
in
the
plane
almost
unconscious
for
one
of
the
germans
had
all
but
choked
the
life
from
him
as
the
first
german
sprang
jack
met
him
with
a
straight
right
hand
blow
to
the
face
and
the
man
reeled
back
the
second
seeing
the
fate
of
his
companion
dived
for
jack
legs
and
seized
them
pulling
the
lad
down
jack
felt
out
with
his
left
hand
and
encircled
the
german
neck
then
he
squeezed
the
german
gasped
for
breath
as
his
wind
was
shut
off
his
hand
searched
his
belt
and
presently
flashed
aloft
with
a
knife
jack
saw
it
releasing
his
hold
on
the
man
throat
he
seized
the
knife
arm
with
his
left
hand
and
twisted
sharply
at
the
same
time
driving
his
right
fist
into
the
man
face
there
was
a
sharp
snap
and
a
cry
of
pain
the
knife
fell
clattering
to
the
deck
of
the
plane
jack
very
angry
rose
to
his
feet
stooped
over
and
picking
up
the
german
as
though
he
had
been
a
child
heaved
him
overboard
so
much
for
you
he
muttered
he
stepped
across
the
body
of
the
second
german
to
frank
side
and
stooped
over
him
gently
he
raised
his
chum
head
to
his
knee
frank
eyelids
flickered
and
directly
he
opened
his
eyes
how
do
you
feel
old
man
asked
jack
frank
struggled
free
from
his
chum
grip
and
sat
up
he
shook
his
head
once
or
twice
and
then
rose
to
his
feet
i
be
all
right
in
look
out
he
broke
off
suddenly
he
dodged
but
jack
not
realizing
the
import
of
frank
words
remained
still
he
felt
something
hot
sear
the
lobe
of
his
ear
wheeling
abruptly
the
lad
saw
the
german
whom
he
had
first
knocked
unconscious
facing
him
with
levelled
revolver
the
weapon
was
own
which
he
had
left
behind
when
he
swam
to
the
enemy
aeroplane
the
german
faced
him
with
a
smile
hands
up
he
commanded
but
jack
with
a
few
drops
of
blood
trickling
from
his
ear
suddenly
became
very
angry
he
objected
to
being
shot
at
from
behind
put
down
that
gun
he
commanded
in
a
cold
voice
put
it
down
before
i
kill
you
the
german
was
struck
by
the
menace
in
the
lad
tones
and
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
and
the
revolver
wavered
then
he
braced
and
brought
the
weapon
up
again
but
that
moment
of
hesitation
decided
the
issue
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
revolver
was
pointed
right
at
him
and
that
only
a
few
feet
away
jack
took
a
quick
step
forward
the
german
fired
jack
swerved
a
trifle
the
bullet
plowed
through
the
sleeve
of
his
shirt
and
touched
the
skin
but
that
was
all
again
the
man
hand
tightened
on
the
trigger
but
he
never
fired
again
jack
powerful
left
hand
seized
his
wrist
and
twisted
the
revolver
from
it
then
still
grasping
the
wrist
the
lad
wheeled
on
his
heel
the
german
left
the
spot
where
he
had
been
standing
as
though
pulled
by
a
locomotive
he
was
lifted
high
in
the
air
and
as
jack
gave
a
jerk
and
then
released
his
hold
the
man
went
sailing
through
the
air
and
dropped
into
the
sea
with
a
loud
splash
and
at
the
same
moment
the
intense
darkness
was
shattered
the
first
faint
streak
of
dawn
showed
in
the
east
jack
sat
down
frank
did
likewise
that
settles
that
said
jack
briefly
now
we
had
better
get
away
from
here
we
have
any
too
much
time
frank
without
a
word
took
his
place
at
the
wheel
feel
fit
asked
jack
frank
nodded
though
he
felt
terribly
faint
sure
you
can
make
it
jack
continued
yes
replied
frank
well
i
just
wanted
to
know
said
jack
because
here
comes
a
german
torpedo
boat
frank
was
startled
he
turned
in
his
seat
and
there
not
a
mile
and
a
half
away
was
a
ship
of
war
she
was
flying
the
german
flag
and
was
making
directly
for
the
spot
where
the
british
hydroplane
rested
by
george
wo
we
ever
get
out
of
this
the
lad
muttered
we
wo
unless
you
hurry
said
jack
but
those
two
germans
wo
they
be
picked
up
and
give
the
alarm
one
of
wo
said
jack
grimly
and
i
feel
pretty
safe
about
the
other
too
let
get
up
in
the
air
frank
tinkered
with
the
motor
and
took
a
firm
grip
on
the
wheel
but
the
hydroplane
did
not
move
something
wrong
said
frank
quietly
what
demanded
jack
something
wrong
with
the
motor
it
wo
work
frank
had
bent
over
and
was
examining
it
carefully
came
a
shot
from
the
german
torpedo
boat
if
we
do
get
out
of
here
pretty
quick
said
jack
quietly
we
wo
get
out
at
all
frank
made
no
reply
but
continued
to
tinker
with
the
engine
a
second
shot
from
the
german
torpedo
boat
it
skimmed
the
water
ahead
of
the
hydroplane
jack
gazed
toward
the
vessel
as
he
did
so
a
small
boat
put
off
from
the
german
and
headed
toward
them
they
coming
after
us
frank
said
jack
a
whole
boatload
of
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
fix
that
thing
frank
uttered
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
i
found
it
he
cried
five
minutes
he
answered
jack
question
five
minutes
is
liable
to
be
too
late
returned
jack
measuring
the
distance
to
the
rapidly
approaching
german
boat
with
his
eye
however
hurry
as
much
as
you
can
frank
did
not
take
his
eye
from
his
engine
how
far
away
he
asked
as
he
worked
three
quarters
of
a
mile
replied
jack
calmly
lots
of
time
for
us
then
said
frank
still
working
as
swiftly
as
possible
maybe
replied
his
chum
do
forget
they
carry
pretty
fair
rifles
with
them
if
we
can
get
started
before
they
shoot
i
guarantee
they
do
get
us
returned
frank
well
they
get
us
if
you
keep
talking
and
do
get
a
move
on
there
said
jack
they
coming
like
the
wind
that
just
the
way
i
working
she
almost
fixed
row
can
you
hold
them
off
what
with
a
single
revolver
against
a
score
of
rifles
not
much
they
right
on
us
now
how
that
engine
fixed
cried
frank
at
that
moment
straightening
up
all
right
let
her
go
then
said
jack
calmly
they
do
know
yet
that
we
going
to
run
they
have
made
no
preparations
to
fire
evidently
they
think
we
shall
wait
for
them
even
while
jack
was
speaking
the
hydroplane
began
to
move
slowly
over
the
surface
of
the
water
very
slowly
it
went
at
first
then
faster
and
faster
halt
came
a
cry
from
the
german
boat
jack
picked
up
his
cap
and
waved
it
at
the
germans
some
other
time
he
called
back
we
terrible
busy
today
goodbye
the
german
officer
gave
a
sharp
command
several
sailors
sprang
to
their
feet
and
blazed
away
at
the
hydroplane
with
their
rifles
bullets
flew
by
on
all
sides
but
none
struck
home
again
jack
waved
his
cap
very
bad
shooting
he
remarked
looks
like
some
of
my
hello
that
was
so
bad
for
the
lad
cap
which
he
had
been
waving
in
derision
at
the
pursuing
foe
was
suddenly
carried
from
his
hand
by
a
german
bullet
by
jove
said
jack
quietly
i
would
have
lost
that
cap
he
gazed
at
it
as
it
floated
in
the
water
and
at
that
instant
frank
sent
the
hydroplane
soaring
into
the
air
with
a
lurch
jack
glanced
down
into
the
water
hold
on
frank
he
cried
in
response
to
this
command
frank
slowed
down
what
the
matter
now
he
demanded
why
one
of
our
erstwhile
german
friends
has
come
to
life
he
was
just
about
to
lay
hold
of
us
when
you
came
up
in
the
air
great
scott
what
do
you
think
of
that
what
do
i
think
of
what
why
the
germans
in
the
boat
have
just
shot
him
shot
whom
the
german
yes
they
saw
him
coming
after
us
and
evidently
thought
he
was
a
friend
of
ours
poor
fellow
to
be
shot
down
by
one
of
his
own
countrymen
and
so
goes
the
last
chance
the
germans
had
of
learning
that
we
have
discovered
their
plans
then
it
is
a
good
thing
for
us
they
shot
him
for
us
yes
but
think
of
the
irony
of
it
well
said
frank
i
would
like
to
have
shot
him
defenseless
as
he
was
and
i
did
want
you
to
that
why
i
did
suggest
having
a
look
for
him
before
we
came
up
i
could
have
done
it
returned
jack
no
nor
i
and
yet
duty
would
have
demanded
it
for
with
him
alive
there
always
remained
a
chance
that
he
would
give
the
warning
it
just
goes
to
show
said
jack
slowly
that
even
fate
sometimes
works
on
the
side
of
the
right
true
unconsciously
frank
had
allowed
the
speed
of
the
hydroplane
to
diminish
during
this
conversation
and
the
crew
of
the
german
boat
again
had
found
themselves
within
range
they
had
started
to
abandon
the
chase
when
the
plane
soared
aloft
but
when
it
had
slowed
down
they
had
resumed
the
pursuit
hoping
that
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
craft
several
bullets
flew
about
the
machine
great
scott
they
at
it
again
cried
jack
let
get
away
from
here
right
now
all
right
here
she
goes
said
frank
full
speed
ahead
chapter
xii
the
boys
give
the
warning
one
other
adventure
it
transpired
was
to
befall
frank
and
jack
before
they
found
themselves
once
more
aboard
the
british
battleship
and
while
it
did
not
result
seriously
both
lads
once
more
approached
the
very
door
of
death
the
morning
sun
was
well
above
the
horizon
when
jack
shading
his
eyes
made
out
in
the
distance
a
smudge
of
smoke
smoke
ahead
frank
he
called
hope
it
the
replied
the
lad
it
should
be
if
i
have
calculated
correctly
a
few
moments
later
the
outline
of
a
large
ship
of
war
loomed
up
ahead
can
you
make
her
out
yet
asked
jack
no
but
she
built
like
the
the
hydroplane
sped
on
by
jove
she
is
the
cried
frank
a
few
moments
later
we
in
luck
frank
was
right
as
the
hydroplane
drew
nearer
it
was
plain
to
make
out
that
the
vessel
was
the
giant
battleship
the
lads
had
quitted
the
day
before
wonder
what
captain
raleigh
will
think
of
our
information
said
frank
with
a
chuckle
do
know
we
been
pretty
fortunate
though
i
hope
we
are
in
time
so
do
i
the
trouble
is
our
ships
are
scattered
so
far
apart
that
they
may
not
be
able
to
assemble
quick
enough
in
sufficient
strength
to
beat
off
the
enemy
do
worry
they
wo
get
very
far
said
jack
confidently
oh
i
know
that
but
if
they
should
happen
to
come
upon
a
small
portion
of
our
fleet
we
are
likely
to
get
the
worst
of
it
well
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
be
able
to
do
that
now
we
know
their
plans
that
true
too
and
they
wo
unless
it
is
decided
to
engage
them
in
spite
of
their
numbers
trusting
reinforcements
will
arrive
in
time
and
though
the
lad
had
no
idea
he
was
making
a
prophecy
that
is
just
what
actually
occurred
the
hydroplane
now
was
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
and
frank
reduced
its
speed
abruptly
whether
this
sudden
slowing
down
had
anything
to
do
with
what
followed
it
is
hard
to
tell
but
no
sooner
had
frank
reduced
the
speed
of
the
craft
than
the
plane
wabbled
crazily
look
out
jack
shouted
frank
she
going
down
jack
had
not
realized
that
there
was
anything
wrong
and
now
he
did
not
grasp
the
full
significance
of
frank
words
what
jack
thought
frank
meant
was
that
he
was
going
to
glide
down
to
the
deck
of
the
battleship
frank
however
knew
that
there
was
something
seriously
wrong
with
the
craft
his
first
thought
had
been
to
jump
after
crying
out
to
jack
but
seeing
that
his
friend
had
not
understood
frank
stuck
to
his
post
trying
as
well
as
he
knew
how
to
bring
the
plane
to
the
sea
as
gently
as
possible
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
he
would
succeed
for
as
it
neared
the
water
the
plane
righted
itself
frank
drew
a
breath
of
relief
but
his
relief
was
after
remaining
upon
a
level
keel
for
one
single
instant
the
hydroplane
turned
turtle
there
came
a
cry
of
warning
from
aboard
the
and
even
before
the
falling
boys
struck
water
boats
were
lowered
over
the
side
manned
and
dashed
to
the
rescue
although
frank
had
been
unable
to
maintain
the
plane
on
an
even
keel
his
efforts
had
done
some
good
for
the
distance
was
not
so
great
from
the
water
when
the
plane
capsized
as
it
would
have
been
but
for
his
strenuous
efforts
jack
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
as
he
felt
himself
being
hurled
into
space
for
he
had
not
realized
what
was
about
to
happen
frank
on
the
other
hand
had
realized
his
position
full
well
and
no
sound
escaped
him
as
he
was
thrown
into
the
water
in
falling
jack
was
thrown
clear
of
the
machine
which
struck
the
water
with
a
great
splash
not
so
frank
who
held
in
by
the
wheel
was
carried
down
with
the
plane
the
lad
was
very
close
to
death
at
that
moment
and
he
knew
it
he
had
caught
a
deep
breath
as
he
was
drawn
under
however
and
this
stood
him
in
good
stead
calmly
the
lad
reached
for
the
large
pocketknife
he
always
carried
and
with
this
under
water
as
he
was
proceeded
quietly
to
cut
the
sides
of
the
craft
sufficiently
to
allow
him
to
escape
and
in
this
he
was
successful
at
last
he
was
free
and
struck
upward
as
swiftly
as
possible
when
it
seemed
that
his
lungs
must
burst
for
want
of
air
his
head
suddenly
bobbed
upon
the
surface
he
gasped
as
he
inhaled
great
breaths
of
the
fresh
air
a
boat
approached
at
that
moment
and
he
was
drawn
aboard
where
he
sank
down
jack
when
he
came
up
from
below
had
thought
first
of
frank
rapidly
he
scanned
the
surface
of
the
sea
for
some
sign
of
his
chum
or
of
the
wreckage
seeing
neither
he
knew
what
had
happened
taking
a
deep
breath
he
dived
it
took
the
lad
some
time
to
locate
the
sinking
mass
of
wreckage
below
and
when
he
did
come
upon
it
there
was
no
sign
of
frank
jack
stayed
below
until
he
could
stand
it
no
more
then
rose
to
the
surface
there
rough
hands
seized
him
and
dragged
him
into
a
boat
in
vain
the
lad
struggled
he
wanted
to
get
loose
so
he
could
make
another
attempt
to
rescue
his
friend
frank
he
cried
be
still
said
a
voice
kindly
frank
is
safe
in
the
next
boat
jack
uttered
an
exclamation
of
relief
and
lay
still
resting
from
his
exertions
and
so
they
came
again
to
the
and
were
lifted
aboard
frank
and
jack
clasped
hands
when
they
stood
on
deck
and
jack
exclaimed
by
jove
i
thought
it
was
all
over
when
i
could
find
you
down
there
i
thought
it
was
all
over
myself
for
a
minute
said
frank
one
time
when
this
old
knife
of
mine
helped
out
i
brought
it
back
with
me
he
displayed
the
knife
and
patted
it
affectionately
how
do
you
feel
asked
jack
first
rate
and
you
fine
now
we
want
to
see
captain
raleigh
at
this
moment
the
third
officer
approached
captain
raleigh
will
receive
you
the
moment
you
have
put
on
some
dry
clothes
said
the
third
officer
but
we
must
see
him
at
once
exclaimed
frank
change
your
clothes
first
said
the
third
officer
kindly
but
frank
began
i
have
captain
raleigh
orders
for
you
to
report
to
him
the
moment
you
have
changed
said
the
third
officer
sharply
you
will
hurry
if
you
please
frank
could
see
that
there
was
no
use
protesting
further
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
the
two
boys
made
their
way
to
their
cabin
the
big
chump
said
frank
as
he
slipped
off
his
wet
clothing
the
whole
british
navy
might
be
sent
to
the
bottom
while
we
are
doing
this
what
are
a
few
wet
clothes
i
guess
it
was
the
way
we
went
at
it
said
jack
if
we
had
blurted
out
what
we
knew
to
tell
the
truth
i
a
good
notion
to
say
nothing
about
what
i
learned
said
frank
jack
looked
at
his
companion
in
the
greatest
surprise
oh
no
you
not
he
said
at
last
as
he
slipped
on
a
dry
shirt
do
you
believe
i
have
declared
frank
i
mad
i
do
like
that
way
of
doing
things
now
if
it
had
been
lord
hastings
well
it
was
said
jack
i
afraid
that
one
trouble
with
us
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
simply
that
he
allowed
us
to
get
too
familiar
with
him
the
result
is
we
expect
it
from
others
and
when
they
do
treat
us
that
way
we
are
disappointed
that
may
be
it
of
course
frank
conceded
but
at
the
same
time
i
did
like
the
tone
of
the
third
officer
just
now
perhaps
i
did
either
said
jack
but
i
got
more
sense
than
to
show
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
suppose
we
should
have
obeyed
without
question
frank
continued
to
mumble
as
he
slipped
into
a
dry
coat
he
picked
up
his
cap
and
moved
toward
the
door
ready
he
asked
of
jack
almost
how
that
shoulder
all
right
how
your
wound
just
a
scratch
did
even
bleed
much
jack
picked
up
his
cap
and
also
moved
toward
the
door
of
the
cabin
guess
maybe
he
let
us
see
captain
raleigh
now
he
said
come
on
frank
followed
his
chum
on
deck
almost
the
first
person
they
encountered
was
the
third
officer
did
take
you
long
he
said
with
a
smile
that
is
because
we
have
important
news
said
frank
come
then
i
conduct
you
to
the
captain
myself
said
the
third
officer
frank
and
jack
hurried
after
him
captain
raleigh
greeted
the
two
lads
with
a
smile
as
they
stood
at
attention
before
him
you
are
back
really
sooner
than
i
expected
you
he
said
quietly
have
you
learned
anything
if
you
please
sir
said
jack
i
shall
skip
the
details
until
later
the
german
high
sea
fleet
will
be
off
the
coast
of
denmark
before
midnight
what
that
you
say
he
demanded
it
true
sir
replied
frank
quietly
stepping
forward
the
german
high
sea
fleet
in
almost
full
strength
will
attack
our
patrol
squadron
in
the
skagerak
off
jutland
tonight
for
one
moment
captain
raleigh
looked
at
both
lads
closely
then
he
cried
sharply
including
all
in
the
cabin
with
his
words
follow
me
he
sprang
for
the
bridge
chapter
xiii
preparing
for
battle
eleven
jack
returned
his
watch
to
his
pocket
not
much
time
to
gather
the
fleet
together
he
said
quietly
to
frank
no
was
his
chum
reply
but
you
can
rest
assured
that
all
can
be
done
will
be
done
captain
raleigh
upon
the
bridge
had
issued
orders
swiftly
the
which
had
been
heading
southward
after
frank
and
jack
returned
aboard
was
quickly
brought
about
after
several
sharp
commands
to
his
officers
captain
raleigh
motioned
to
frank
and
jack
come
with
me
he
said
you
shall
tell
me
what
you
have
learned
as
we
go
along
the
two
lads
followed
him
straight
to
the
wireless
room
went
the
commander
of
the
get
the
quickly
he
ordered
the
wireless
operator
the
call
went
across
the
water
there
was
no
reply
try
the
was
the
next
command
flashed
the
wireless
the
receiving
apparatus
aboard
the
clicked
sharply
answering
sir
reported
the
operator
send
this
ordered
captain
raleigh
and
passed
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
he
had
scribbled
rapidly
to
the
wireless
operator
the
message
read
as
follows
german
high
sea
fleet
to
attack
off
jutland
tonight
inform
admiral
beatty
relay
message
am
steaming
for
danish
coast
to
engage
enemy
information
authentic
follow
me
signed
raleigh
a
short
pause
and
again
the
receiving
apparatus
on
the
clicked
sharply
sir
said
the
operator
all
right
this
from
captain
raleigh
call
the
again
the
wireless
began
to
click
two
minutes
later
the
operator
reported
answering
sir
send
the
same
message
instructed
captain
raleigh
it
might
be
well
to
state
here
that
all
these
messages
were
sent
in
code
for
it
was
probable
that
a
german
vessel
of
some
sort
might
be
within
the
wireless
zone
and
if
able
to
read
the
messages
as
they
flashed
across
the
sea
would
have
communicated
with
the
main
german
fleet
one
after
another
now
the
wireless
of
the
picked
up
the
battle
cruisers
black
prince
and
the
all
of
which
chanced
to
be
within
range
of
the
wireless
the
destroyers
and
also
answered
the
call
and
were
instructed
to
proceed
to
the
skagerak
at
full
speed
and
to
each
vessel
as
it
answered
the
single
word
relay
was
flashed
this
meant
that
captain
raleigh
wanted
the
word
sent
to
other
vessels
of
the
british
fleet
not
within
her
own
wireless
radius
and
the
answer
to
this
was
invariably
the
same
still
in
the
wireless
room
captain
raleigh
turned
to
frank
and
jack
and
said
now
i
shall
be
glad
to
know
how
you
boys
learned
this
information
jack
explained
as
briefly
as
possible
captain
raleigh
interrupted
occasionally
as
jack
proceeded
with
his
story
and
when
the
lad
had
concluded
he
said
quietly
you
have
done
well
young
sirs
england
has
much
to
thank
you
for
but
will
the
others
arrive
in
time
sir
asked
frank
anxiously
that
said
captain
raleigh
i
can
not
say
you
may
be
sure
that
they
will
come
to
our
assistance
at
all
possible
speed
however
but
you
will
not
await
them
there
sir
no
i
shall
engage
the
enemy
single
handed
if
necessary
with
this
captain
raleigh
turned
on
his
heel
and
would
have
left
the
wireless
room
at
that
moment
however
the
wireless
began
to
click
again
and
the
commander
of
the
paused
for
us
he
asked
the
operator
nodded
admiral
beatty
aboard
the
calling
sir
take
his
message
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
the
operator
called
off
the
clicks
of
his
apparatus
admiral
beatty
wants
to
know
your
source
of
information
he
reported
captain
raleigh
dictated
a
reply
again
silence
for
a
few
moments
and
then
the
operator
said
the
is
ordered
to
the
skagerak
under
full
speed
hold
the
enemy
until
the
arrival
of
the
main
fleet
assistance
on
the
way
and
also
steaming
for
jutland
to
lend
a
hand
open
the
engagement
immediately
you
sight
the
enemy
sign
said
captain
raleigh
the
operator
obeyed
and
heard
the
operator
aboard
the
repeat
his
message
i
guess
that
is
about
all
we
can
do
said
captain
raleigh
again
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
and
once
more
paused
at
the
door
keep
your
instrument
going
he
ordered
the
operator
pick
up
any
ship
that
may
not
have
heard
the
message
come
boys
this
last
to
frank
and
jack
the
boys
followed
their
commander
back
to
the
bridge
thence
to
his
cabin
the
interchange
of
messages
had
taken
time
and
glancing
at
his
watch
now
frank
saw
that
it
was
after
one
great
scott
he
exclaimed
i
had
no
idea
we
had
been
in
the
wireless
room
so
long
back
in
his
cabin
captain
raleigh
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
presence
he
was
busy
for
perhaps
an
hour
poring
over
a
mass
of
charts
and
other
papers
frank
and
jack
stood
at
attention
they
were
becoming
uneasy
when
captain
raleigh
looked
up
suddenly
pass
the
word
for
the
first
officer
he
instructed
jack
sprang
to
obey
and
in
a
moment
the
first
officer
of

in
the
cabin
shape
your
course
for
jutland
proper
ordered
captain
raleigh
the
first
officer

obeyed
we
go
back
to
the
wireless
room
captain
raleigh
informed
the
two
lads
i
want
to
keep
you
boys
near
me
for
i
may
desire
to
ask
a
question
at
any
moment
the
lads
followed
their
commander
back
to
the
wireless
room

asked
the
operator

the
operator
sent

a
few
moments
later

later

the

reported

a

this
he
said

to
the
wireless
room
then
sir
said
frank
very
well
report
to
me
instantly
a
message
is
received
frank
saluted
and
took
his
departure
jack
stood
at
attention
in
captain
raleigh
cabin
as
the
commander
of
the
again
plunged
into
a
mass
of
charts
captain
raleigh
sprang
to
his
feet
and
opened
his
watch
four
he
said
we
wo
reach
skagerak
until
well
after
six
i
am
in
hopes
the
germans
will
not
try
to
pass
through
before
early
morning
we
shall
be
ready
for
them
then
how
big
a
fleet
have
we
there
now
sir
asked
jack
none
to
speak
of
two
or
three
cruisers
and
a
couple
of
torpedo
boats
i
believe
we
have
a
submarine
or
two
there
also
though
i
can
not
be
sure
of
that
we
lick
sir
said
jack
enthusiastically
captain
raleigh
smiled
i
hope
so
he
said
quietly
at
that
moment
the
first
officer
called
from
the
bridge
battleship
overhauling
us
fast
sir
probably
the
said
captain
raleigh
he
went
on
deck
jack
followed
him
chapter
xiv
changed
orders
at
the
same
moment
frank
came
running
up
reports
she
has
sighted
us
sir
good
exclaimed
captain
raleigh
i
felt
sure
it
was
the
tell
her
we
shall
steam
slowly
until
she
comes
up
with
us
frank
saluted
and
returned
to
the
wireless
room
now
captain
raleigh
gave
an
order
to
the
first
officer
have
all
hands
piped
to
quarters
mr
macdonald
instantly
all
became
bustle
aboard
the
men
rushed
hither
and
thither
but
in
a
moment
order
was
restored
out
of
the
seeming
confusion
followed
by
jack
his
first
and
second
officers
captain
raleigh
made
an
inspection
of
the
giant
battleship
he
addressed
the
different
groups
of
men
as
he
passed
and
told
them
what
was
about
to
transpire
it
is
likely
to
be
a
battle
at
first
he
told
the
men
quietly
but
i
know
that
none
of
you
will
shrink
because
of
that
you
have
fought
against
odds
before
now
you
will
not
mind
doing
it
again
the
men
cheered
him
his
tour
of
inspection
completed
captain
raleigh
ordered
let
each
man
be
served
with
a
good
meal
and
let
them
have
two
hours
sleep
all
but
the
watches
the
necessary
orders
were
given
and
a
short
time
later
the
men
were
eating
heartily
then
they
went
to
their
quarters
where
some
lay
down
to
sleep
while
others
sat
in
groups
and
discussed
the
impending
battle
shortly
after
five
frank
and
jack
found
themselves
alone
in
their
cabin
having
been
relieved
of
duty
for
an
hour
it
going
to
be
a
great
fight
frank
declared
jack
you
bet
it
is
it
will
be
the
greatest
naval
battle
of
history
if
the
bulk
of
the
british
fleet
comes
up
in
time
never
before
has
such
a
vast
array
of
giant
fighting
ships
as
will
be
engaged
in
this
struggle
contended
for
supremacy
in
total
tonnage
engaged
and
in
the
matter
of
armament
and
complement
it
will
outrival
even
the
victory
of
nelson
at
trafalgar
and
the
defeat
of
the
spanish
armada
and
the
british
as
always
will
win
let
us
hope
so
but
as
you
and
i
know
the
germans
are
no
mean
opponents
considering
the
fact
that
since
the
outbreak
of
the
war
they
have
had
little
opportunity
to
practise
war
tactics
on
the
sea
and
practically
no
chance
at
all
to
practise
gunnery
the
few
battles
that
have
been
fought
have
proven
them
foemen
worthy
of
the
best
we
have
to
offer
true
said
frank
until
reinforcements
arrive
they
will
outnumber
us
i
do
know
how
many
to
one
to
my
mind
it
is
foolish
to
engage
the
german
fleet
with
only
a
few
ships
said
jack
it
wo
gain
us
anything
i
believe
we
should
retreat
slowly
and
draw
them
on
i
believe
that
would
be
a
much
better
plan
we
might
engage
them
at
long
range
running
slowly
before
them
then
when
the
main
fleet
came
up
we
would
take
them
by
surprise
and
even
at
that
moment
the
same
plan
was
being
revolved
in
the
mind
of
beatty
as
in
his
flagship
the
he
steamed
swiftly
northward
by
this
time
the
battleship
had
drawn
up
almost
on
even
terms
with
the
the
wireless
of
both
ships
were
busy
as
the
commanders
exchanged
greetings
and
discussed
their
plans
for
battle
a
little
later
as
the
drew
even
closer
captain
reynolds
of
the
flashed
this
message
i
am
coming
aboard
you
half
an
hour
later
he
came
over
the
side
of
the
and
disappeared
with
captain
raleigh
in
the
latter
cabin
directly
an
aide
was
despatched
for
frank
and
jack
who
made
their
way
to
their
commander
quarters
so
exclaimed
captain
reynolds
when
his
eye
fell
on
jack
this
lad
is
one
of
the
two
who
gained
this
important
information
eh
let
me
hear
your
story
again
sir
jack
repeated
the
account
of
the
adventures
he
and
his
friend
had
had
the
night
before
captain
raleigh
produced
the
paper
the
lads
had
taken
from
the
commander
of
the
german
air
squadron
and
the
two
commanders
scanned
it
together
well
there
is
one
thing
in
our
favor
said
captain
reynolds
the
germans
will
fail
to
get
the
air
support
they
are
expecting
there
probably
will
be
other
aircraft
with
the
fleet
said
captain
raleigh
most
likely
probably
a
zeppelin
or
two
with
them
fortunate
we
have
these
new
guns
aboard
they
were
completed
any
too
soon
raleigh
what
ships
are
in
the
skagerak
now
only
three
i
believe
the
and
the
the
former
a
battle
cruiser
and
the
latter
two
torpedo
boats
if
we
can
arrive
in
time
there
will
be
five
of
us
then
if
the
the
and
the
cruisers
black
and
come
up
in
time
we
will
be
more
on
even
terms
exactly
but
the
main
fleet
farther
south
will
hardly
arrive
in
time
i
am
afraid
and
by
the
way
you
are
wrong
in
your
calculations
the
is
with
the
main
fleet
is
that
so
so
then
is
the
the
the
the
the
and
the
yes
those
with
a
dozen
battle
cruisers
and
a
score
of
torpedo
boats
comprise
the
main
fleet
if
they
arrive
in
time
the
germans
must
either
run
or
be
sent
to
the
bottom
at
this
moment
a
message
was
handed
to
captain
raleigh
from
the
wireless
room
change
in
orders
said
the
commander
briefly
after
scanning
the
piece
of
paper
we
are
to
engage
the
enemy
at
long
range
and
seek
to
draw
him
farther
into
the
north
sea
orders
have
been
sent
to
the
three
ships
off
jutland
to
fall
back
before
the
approach
of
the
enemy
until
we
can
join
them
if
they
sight
the
enemy
before
we
arrive
if
not
we
are
all
to
retire
slowly
the
three
cruisers
and
half
a
dozen
torpedo
boats
will
join
us
soon
after
dawn
the
main
fleet
can
not
arrive
until
two
hours
before
noon
by
jove
raleigh
exclaimed
captain
reynolds
i
am
better
satisfied
with
those
orders
there
is
more
chance
of
success
now
it
would
have
been
foolhardy
for
us
to
engage
the
whole
german
fleet
i
agree
with
you
well
i
get
back
to
my
vessel
now
captain
reynolds
arose
and
extended
his
hand
to
his
fellow
commander
in
case
he
said
simply
captain
raleigh
gripped
the
hand
then
he
accompanied
captain
reynolds
and
saw
him
over
the
side
it
was
now
after
the
german
fleet
was
due
off
jutland
at
almost
any
moment
captain
raleigh
and
jack
made
their
way
to
the
wireless
room
get
the
commanded
captain
raleigh
of
the
operator
went
the
call
came
the
reply
a
few
moments
later
this
conversation
between
the
two
commanders
ensued
have
you
sighted
the
enemy
this
from
the
no
from
the
have
any
of
your
consorts
picked
up
the
foe
not
yet
you
received
my
earlier
instructions
yes
we
are
holding
our
ground
until
we
sight
the
enemy
then
we
shall
retire
how
long
before
you
will
come
up
with
us
in
your
present
position
two
hours
if
you
fall
back
we
shall
of
course
be
with
you
sooner
are
you
ready
for
action
yes
cleared
good
i
am
giving
my
men
all
the
rest
possible
goodbye
funny
said
captain
raleigh
to
jack
they
should
have
sighted
the
enemy
by
this
time
it
would
seem
so
sir
agreed
jack
well
they
probably
will
be
in
sight
by
the
time
we
come
up
with
the
said
captain
raleigh
but
two
hours
later
when
the
and
came
up
with
the
other
british
ships
no
enemy
had
been
sighted
yet
it
was
then
almost
nine
you
are
sure
you
have
not
miscalculated
the
time
captain
raleigh
asked
of
frank
and
jack
positive
sir
replied
the
former
besides
you
have
the
document
relating
to
the
attack
true
enough
the
enemy
probably
has
been
delayed
or
perhaps
they
will
await
the
coming
of
daylight
it
would
be
better
if
they
did
for
us
i
mean
would
it
sir
asked
frank
much
better
replied
his
commander
briefly
then
let
us
hope
that
is
what
happens
but
i
am
afraid
it
wo
happen
said
jack
if
the
germans
get
this
far
safely
they
wo
wait
for
us
to
overtake
them
no
you
right
there
said
captain
raleigh
the
thing
that
worries
me
is
that
if
they
do
get
by
us
they
will
spread
out
all
over
the
sea
they
will
be
able
to
raid
the
british
coast
may
succeed
in
running
through
the
english
channel
and
then
we
shall
have
to
round
them
up
all
over
again
they
would
scatter
over
the
seven
seas
then
we
got
to
lick
declared
frank
grimly
captain
raleigh
smiled
that
the
spirit
i
like
to
see
he
said
quietly
it
is
the
spirit
that
has
carried
the
british
flag
to
victory
against
overwhelming
odds
on
many
occasions
but
he
is
not
an
englishman
sir
said
jack
with
a
smile
what
exclaimed
captain
raleigh
not
an
englishman
then
what
is
he
american
was
jack
reply
oh
well
it
amounts
practically
to
the
same
thing
declared
captain
raleigh
next
to
being
an
american
said
frank
quietly
i
would
be
english
the
first
officer
lieutenant
macdonald
burst
into
the
captain
cabin
at
this
moment
message
from
the
sir
he
exclaimed
german
battle
squadron
steaming
at
twenty
knots
sighted
five
miles
off
jutland
sir
chapter
xv
the
first
gun
skagerak
in
which
the
greatest
naval
battle
of
history
was
about
to
be
fought
is
an
arm
of
the
north
sea
between
norway
and
denmark
the
scene
of
the
battle
was
laid
off
jutland
and
horn
reef
on
the
southern
extremity
of
denmark
from
the
reef
of
heligoland
the
main
german
base
in
the
north
sea
to
jutland
is
about
one
hundred
miles
as
the
crow
flies
therefore
it
became
evident
that
the
german
high
sea
fleet
must
have
left
the
protection
of
that
supposedly
impregnable
fortress
some
time
before
that
the
advance
of
the
german
fleet
had
been
well
planned
was
indicated
by
the
very
fact
that
it
could
successfully
elude
the
british
cruisers
patrolling
the
entrance
to
the
mine
fields
that
guarded
heligoland
itself
could
a
british
fleet
of
any
size
have
got
between
the
german
high
sea
fleet
and
heligoland
the
menace
of
the
german
fleet
would
have
ended
for
all
time
at
the
moment
however
the
british
warships
were
scattered
over
the
north
sea
in
such
a
manner
as
to
preclude
such
an
attempt
and
the
best
admiral
beatty
and
admiral
jellicoe
could
hope
for
was
to
come
up
with
the
german
fleet
and
give
battle
preventing
if
possible
the
escape
of
any
units
of
the
fleet
to
other
parts
of
the
sea
and
to
drive
all
that
the
british
could
not
sink
back
to
heligoland
the
german
dash
of
one
hundred
miles
across
the
north
sea
was
a
bold
venture
and
one
that
the
british
had
not
believed
the
germans
would
attempt
at
that
time
british
vigilance
had
been
lax
or
the
german
fleet
could
never
have
gone
so
far
from
its
base
without
discovery
and
this
laxity
proved
costly
for
the
british
and
might
even
have
proven
more
costly
still
above
the
german
fleet
came
a
fleet
of
aircraft
augmented
to
a
great
degree
by
three
powerful
zeppelin
balloons
lying
low
upon
the
water
also
was
a
fleet
of
german
submarines
as
the
german
fleet
approached
jutland
on
the
night
of
may
it
was
shrouded
in
darkness
the
night
was
very
black
and
a
heavy
fog
hung
over
the
sea
the
night
could
not
have
been
better
for
the
attempt
which
would
in
all
probability
have
succeeded
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
the
british
had
been
forewarned
forewarned
is
forearmed
and
this
fact
alone
prevented
the
germans
from
carrying
out
their
designs
it
is
history
that
the
approach
of
the
german
fleet
had
been
reported
to
the
commander
of
the
british
cruiser
by
an
aviator
who
had
sailed
across
the
dark
sea
in
a
hydroplane
whether
the
germans
knew
that
there
were
but
three
british
vessels
in
the
skagerak
can
not
be
told
but
certainly
they
believed
they
were
in
sufficient
strength
to
force
a
passage
particularly
by
a
surprise
attack
which
they
believed
the
present
venture
would
be
therefore
it
must
have
been
a
great
disappointment
to
the
german
admiral
when
a
single
big
gun
boomed
in
the
distance
this
was
the
voice
of
the
british
battleship
mary
which
taking
directions
from
the
aviator
had
fired
the
opening
shot
telling
the
germans
that
their
approach
had
been
discovered
and
that
the
passage
of
the
skagerak
would
be
contested
immediately
the
german
fleet
slowed
down
for
the
german
admiral
had
no
means
of
knowing
the
strength
of
the
british
fleet
at
that
point
hurried
orders
flashed
back
and
forth
a
few
moments
later
three
aeroplanes
which
had
been
hanging
low
above
the
german
fleet
dashed
forward
they
had
been
ordered
forth
to
ascertain
the
strength
of
the
british
in
almost
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
they
were
directly
above
the
british
fleet
which
so
far
consisted
only
of
five
ships
of
war
besides
the
an
armored
cruiser
the
and
torpedo
boats
being
the
and
as
the
germans
approached
in
the
air
a
hydroplane
ascended
from
each
of
the
british
ships
and
british
aviators
gave
chase
to
the
enemy
one
which
had
come
too
close
was
brought
down
but
the
other
two
returned
safely
to
the
shelter
of
the
german
fleet
where
the
british
dare
not
follow
them
because
of
the
presence
of
a
superior
force
of
the
enemy
but
the
german
aviators
had
learned
what
they
had
been
sent
to
learn
they
had
discovered
the
strength
of
the
british
again
sharp
orders
were
flashed
from
the
german
flagship
the
fleet
came
on
faster
captain
raleigh
because
of
his
seniority
had
taken
command
of
the
small
british
squadron
he
had
drawn
his
ships
up
in
a
semicircle
heads
pointed
to
the
foe
as
his
aviators
signalled
that
the
germans
were
again
advancing
captain
raleigh
gave
the
command
that
had
been
long
eagerly
awaited
by
the
men
a
command
which
the
commander
of
the
had
delayed
giving
until
the
last
moment
because
he
desired
to
give
his
men
all
the
rest
he
could
clear
for
action
he
thundered
jack
glanced
at
his
watch
and
as
he
did
so
eight
bells
struck
midnight
the
exclamation
was
wrung
from
frank
and
no
aid
for
at
least
three
hours
said
jack
quietly
as
the
lad
spoke
the
fog
suddenly
lifted
and
gave
to
the
british
a
view
of
the
advancing
german
fleet
forward
turret
guns
cried
captain
raleigh
fire
at
will
a
terrible
salvo
burst
from
the
guns
in
the
forward
turret
at
almost
the
same
moment
the
leading
german
ships
opened
fire
the
first
few
salvos
from
each
side
did
no
damage
for
the
range
had
not
been
gauged
accurately
it
became
apparent
now
that
the
german
admiral
had
no
intention
of
risking
all
his
first
line
ships
in
this
encounter
apparently
he
had
decided
that
his
smaller
vessels
were
fully
capable
of
coping
with
the
small
number
of
the
enemy
that
was
contesting
his
advance
from
the
shelter
of
the
larger
ships
advanced
the
battle
cruisers
not
a
battleship
nor
a
dreadnaught
came
forward
but
the
smaller
ships
dashed
on
swiftly
and
presently
their
guns
found
the
range
a
shell
burst
aboard
the
bridge
carrying
away
nearly
the
entire
superstructure
the
captain
and
his
first
officer
were
killed
and
many
men
were
injured
as
huge
splinters
flew
in
all
directions
under
the
command
of
the
second
officer
the
fought
back
a
shell
from
her
forward
turret
burst
aboard
the
closest
german
vessel
and
there
was
a
terrific
explosion
followed
by
a
series
of
blasts
not
so
loud
came
fearful
cries
from
aboard
the
enemy
and
then
the
whole
sky
was
lighted
up
for
miles
around
as
the
german
ship
sprang
into
a
brilliant
sheet
of
flame
for
perhaps
two
minutes
it
lighted
up
the
heavens
then
there
was
another
violent
explosion
and
the
german
cruiser
disappeared
beneath
the
water
with
a
hiss
like
that
of
a
thousand
serpents
a
cheer
rose
on
the
air
a
loud
british
cheer
one
gone
said
frank
quietly
yes
but
only
one
gone
replied
jack
yes
but
it
two
now
said
frank
hopefully
about
time
to
begin
our
retreat
then
said
jack
and
the
order
for
retreat
came
a
few
moments
later
the
five
british
ships
for
all
were
still
able
to
navigate
in
spite
of
the
damage
that
had
been
inflicted
came
about
in
a
broad
circle
and
headed
westward
then
it
was
the
germans
time
to
cheer
and
they
did
so
with
a
will
it
was
not
often
that
a
british
battleship
had
fled
before
a
german
ship
or
ships
and
the
germans
since
the
war
opened
had
little
chance
to
cheer
such
a
procedure
but
now
that
they
had
such
a
chance
they
cheered
their
best
apparently
they
had
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
british
were
retiring
before
superior
numbers
and
that
even
in
spite
of
that
and
the
fact
that
they
now
were
retreating
they
still
had
the
best
of
the
encounter
so
far
for
one
german
cruiser
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
british
retreat
was
slow
and
for
some
unaccountable
reason
the
germans
did
not
press
forward
as
swiftly
as
they
might
have
done
whether
they
feared
a
trap
or
whether
the
german
admiral
had
determined
to
await
the
coming
of
day
before
disposing
of
the
enemy
was
not
apparent
but
that
he
had
some
plan
in
mind
every
briton
realized
the
longer
he
holds
off
the
better
said
frank
right
agreed
jack
of
course
we
probably
could
run
away
from
them
if
they
pressed
us
too
hard
but
we
would
and
for
that
reason
he
should
be
able
to
dispose
of
us
if
he
came
ahead
swiftly
wonder
why
some
of
these
zeppelins
and
airships
have
come
into
action
said
frank
i
do
know
perhaps
the
germans
are
afraid
of
losing
one
of
them
they
probably
have
other
uses
for
them
for
should
they
break
through
here
it
is
likely
they
have
their
plans
laid
what
time
have
you
three
thirty
said
frank
after
a
glance
at
his
watch
an
hour
almost
till
daylight
do
you
suppose
the
others
will
arrive
on
time
i
hope
so
it
would
be
better
of
course
if
they
arrived
while
it
is
yet
dark
for
then
they
might
come
up
unseen
but
with
their
arrival
we
still
will
be
outnumbered
and
realizing
that
the
germans
when
the
day
breaks
will
press
the
attack
harder
i
guess
we
will
manage
to
hold
them
till
the
main
fleet
arrives
in
the
morning
said
frank
hopefully
we
will
have
to
hold
them
declared
jack
at
this
moment
the
lads
attention
was
directed
to
the
cruiser
already
badly
damaged
a
second
german
shell
had
now
burst
amidships
with
a
loud
explosion
and
that
settles
the
said
jack
sadly
he
was
right
gamely
the
fought
back
but
it
was
apparent
to
all
in
spite
of
the
darkness
that
she
was
settling
lower
and
lower
in
the
water
and
we
ca
rescue
the
men
said
frank
remember
the
admiralty
orders
no
ship
in
action
is
to
go
to
the
aid
of
another
it
would
be
suicide
so
it
would
said
jack
poor
fellows
slowly
the
settled
and
for
a
moment
the
fire
of
all
the
other
vessels
germans
as
well
as
british
lulled
a
bit
all
eyes
were
bent
on
the
sinking
ship
a
wireless
message
was
flashed
from
the
to
captain
raleigh
of
the
goodbye
it
said
hold
them
after
that
there
was
no
further
word
from
the
doomed
cruiser
the
searchlights
of
both
fleets
played
full
upon
the
as
she
settled
lower
in
the
water
she
staggered
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
hold
herself
afloat
and
then
sank
suddenly
the
duel
of
big
guns
broke
out
afresh
chapter
xvi
the
battle
dawn
with
the
breaking
of
the
intense
darkness
what
a
surprise
was
in
store
for
the
germans
back
of
the
four
remaining
british
ships
that
had
at
first
engaged
the
germans
interrupting
their
dash
and
holding
them
in
check
until
the
arrival
of
a
force
strong
enough
to
engage
the
foe
more
closely
came
now
the
relief
promised
by
beatty
gathered
from
various
parts
of
the
north
sea
they
had
steamed
toward
jutland
and
arriving
there
at
almost
the
same
time
they
had
assumed
battle
formation
in
the
darkness
that
the
british
were
approaching
must
have
been
known
by
the
german
admiral
for
their
wireless
apparatus
had
been
working
unceasingly
telling
of
their
approach
and
these
signals
must
have
been
caught
by
the
german
warships
though
because
sent
in
code
they
were
undecipherable
nor
could
the
enemy
tell
by
the
sound
just
how
close
the
british
were
captain
raleigh
too
as
well
as
the
other
british
commanders
had
known
the
other
english
ships
were
forming
some
distance
back
toward
these
they
now
retreated
and
just
as
dawn
broke
and
the
british
sailors
obtained
their
first
view
of
the
promised
assistance
and
greeted
the
new
arrivals
with
cheers
the
british
advanced
to
the
attack
the
german
admiral
taking
in
the
situation
knew
that
he
still
outnumbered
the
british
that
the
advantage
was
still
with
him
he
determined
to
give
battle
he
knew
too
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
until
the
main
british
fleet
would
approach
and
he
determined
to
win
the
battle
before
the
arrival
of
new
foes
he
signalled
an
advance
the
british
fleet
was
great
and
powerful
but
not
so
great
and
powerful
as
the
german
by
far
as
the
mary
and
the
two
torpedo
boats
fell
back
still
the
center
of
german
fire
and
still
hurling
shell
seeking
their
proper
places
in
the
battle
line
the
other
british
vessels
came
on
and
presently
the
and
others
had
gained
their
places
in
the
formation
ahead
of
the
larger
ships
now
the
the
and
the
advanced
the
speediest
of
light
cruisers
the
the
and
the
behind
these
spread
out
came
the
destroyers
turbulent
nestore
alcaster
fortune
sparrow
hawk
and
the
the
and
also
had
fallen
in
line
though
badly
battered
by
the
effects
of
the
german
shells
during
the
night
then
the
three
battle
cruisers
advanced
and
as
the
battle
opened
far
back
came
the
battleship
hurrying
to
join
in
the
struggle
the
german
fleet
advanced
to
the
attack
in
a
broad
the
flagship
the
a
dreadnaught
of
tons
was
squarely
in
the
center
to
her
left
was
the
battleship
and
next
the
to
her
right
the
battleships
and
beyond
the
battleships
to
the
left
were
the
cruisers
and
and
beyond
the
battleships
to
the
right
the
cruisers
and
torpedo
boats
more
than
a
score
of
them
also
spread
far
on
either
side
directly
behind
the
single
dreadnaught
and
the
battleships
came
a
flotilla
of
submarines
ready
to
dash
forward
at
the
proper
moment
and
launch
their
deadly
torpedoes
overhead
and
moving
forward
were
the
three
giant
zeppelins
and
a
flotilla
of
other
aircraft
of
all
the
vessels
engaged
the
was
the
largest
the
advancing
rapidly
came
next
and
then
the
german
dreadnaught
the
british
battle
cruisers
and
were
the
next
most
powerful
in
the
order
named
and
the
other
german
vessels
were
by
far
superior
to
the
british
now
as
the
battle
opened
with
the
greatest
fury
another
british
vessel
was
sighted
to
the
westward
it
was
the
the
flagship
of
beatty
steaming
at
full
speed
ahead
over
the
tops
of
the
three
british
cruisers
light
vessels
travelled
swiftly
toward
the
enemy
the
larger
ships
opened
with
their
big
guns
the
range
was
found
almost
with
the
first
salvo
and
shells
began
to
drop
aboard
the
enemy
the
british
cruiser
making
straight
for
the
german
dreadnaught
hurled
a
shell
aboard
the
german
flagship
that
burst
amidships
there
was
a
terrible
explosion
and
men
were
hurled
into
the
water
in
little
pieces
a
hole
was
blown
through
the
upper
deck
but
the
paid
dearly
for
this
act
the
forward
guns
of
the
poured
a
veritable
rain
of
shells
upon
the
british
vessel
and
in
a
moment
she
was
wounded
unto
death
there
was
nothing
the
other
vessels
of
the
fleet
could
do
to
aid
her
and
it
was
plainly
apparent
that
she
must
sink
but
the
british
tars
stuck
to
their
guns
and
they
continued
to
hurl
shells
into
the
german
line
until
the
water
of
the
north
sea
washed
over
them
the
was
gone
this
left
the
and
the
alone
before
the
larger
british
vessels
and
they
stood
to
their
work
gallantly
the
fire
of
both
cruisers
was
centered
on
the
german
flagship
and
it
was
plain
that
if
they
continued
at
their
work
the
was
doomed
an
order
was
flashed
to
the
german
zeppelins
two
sped
forward
captain
raleigh
of
the
saw
them
advancing
and
the
forward
gun
was
unloosened
the
first
zeppelin
flying
low
was
pierced
before
it
had
moved
forward
a
hundred
yards
and
it
fell
into
the
sea
between
the
german
battleships
a
flaming
mass
but
the
second
came
on
above
the
the
zeppelin
paused
something
dropped
through
the
air
there
was
a
flash
an
explosion
and
a
dense
black
cloud
rolled
across
the
water
when
it
had
cleared
the
was
gone
the
guns
of
the
and
the
fired
furiously
at
the
zeppelin
and
a
few
moments
later
a
shot
from
the
latter
struck
home
the
second
zeppelin
fell
into
the
sea
by
this
time
the
had
drawn
up
with
the
and
the
other
large
british
ships
and
now
these
advanced
majestically
the
first
to
encounter
the
weight
of
their
guns
was
the
german
battleship
of
tons
raked
fore
and
aft
she
was
soon
ablaze
her
crew
leaped
into
the
sea
almost
as
one
man
following
an
explosion
in
her
boiler
room
and
the
water
was
dark
with
bobbing
heads
the
sister
ship
the
slowed
down
and
gave
assistance
in
picking
up
the
crew
of
the
former
vessel
and
while
she
was
engaged
in
this
work
no
british
gun
fired
at
her
gradually
the
the
the
and
the
drew
closer
together
as
they
advanced
upon
the
germans
shells
burst
over
them
with
regularity
but
so
far
none
had
reached
a
vital
spot
the
turned
all
her
forward
guns
on
the
and
raked
her
fore
and
aft
in
vain
the
other
vessels
of
the
german
fleet
sought
to
detract
the
fire
captain
raleigh
had
started
out
with
the
intention
of
disposing
of
the
german
flagship
and
he
was
determined
not
to
heed
the
others
until
the
had
been
sent
to
the
bottom
it
was
no
easy
task
he
had
set
for
himself
for
he
now
was
the
center
of
fire
of
the
whole
german
fleet
almost
a
submarine
darted
forward
to
save
the
the
quick
eye
of
a
british
gunner
caught
it
he
took
aim
and
fired
the
submarine
disappeared
with
a
view
to
disposing
of
the
enemy
immediately
captain
raleigh
ordered
that
one
of
the
two
forward
torpedoes
be
launched
there
was
a
hiss
as
the
little
tube
was
released
the
distance
was
so
close
now
that
a
miss
was
impossible
there
was
an
instant
of
silence
followed
by
a
terrible
rending
sound
then
a
loud
blast
the
torpedo
had
reached
the
boiler
room
quickly
the
german
admiral
and
his
officers
clambered
over
the
side
and
rowed
to
the
where
they
were
taken
on
board
and
the
admiral
flag
run
up
the
was
abandoned
and
she
sank
a
few
moments
later
in
the
meantime
the
british
cruiser
of
tons
had
been
sent
down
by
the
explosion
of
a
german
shell
which
had
reached
her
magazine
so
rapidly
had
she
settled
that
not
a
man
of
her
crew
escaped
thus
had
the
three
light
battle
cruisers
of
the
british
the
vessels
that
had
shown
the
way
been
disposed
of
at
this
moment
beatty
and
his
flagship
the
entered
the
battle
the
great
guns
of
the
flagship
roared
above
the
others
and
the
battleship
singled
out
by
her
fire
soon
sank
in
spite
of
the
german
losses
the
british
so
far
had
had
the
worst
of
the
encounter
and
the
german
admiral
despite
the
loss
of
his
flagship
had
no
mind
to
give
up
the
battle
he
pushed
to
closer
quarters
now
the
fighting
became
more
terrific
shells
struck
upon
all
ships
engaged
at
intervals
of
a
few
seconds
apart
frequently
loud
explosions
were
heard
above
the
voices
of
the
great
guns
and
in
most
cases
these
signified
the
end
of
a
ship
of
war
among
the
smaller
vessels
the
torpedo
boats
which
had
singled
each
other
out
the
execution
had
been
terrible
dead
and
wounded
strewed
the
decks
and
there
was
no
time
for
the
uninjured
to
give
aid
they
were
too
busy
attending
to
their
guns
and
manoeuvering
their
vessels
but
the
outcome
of
an
engagement
such
as
this
could
have
but
one
result
it
seemed
outnumbered
as
they
were
and
fighting
as
bravely
as
they
knew
how
the
british
were
getting
the
worst
of
it
rather
than
sacrifice
more
lives
and
ships
beatty
on
the
gave
the
signal
to
retire
he
was
in
hopes
that
the
germans
would
follow
and
thus
fall
into
the
clutches
of
the
main
british
fleet
which
was
advancing
at
full
speed
and
with
which
beatty
had
been
in
communication
by
wireless
the
germans
accepted
the
bait
as
the
british
drew
off
slowly
and
as
they
advanced
more
ships
steamed
up
from
the
east
it
was
a
second
german
squadron
advancing
to
the
aid
of
the
first
there
was
a
cry
of
surprise
from
the
british
for
they
had
not
known
that
there
was
a
second
fleet
in
such
close
proximity
these
new
vessels
evidently
were
the
reserves
the
german
admiral
had
been
depending
upon
to
turn
the
tide
of
battle
should
his
first
line
ships
not
be
able
to
overcome
the
british
seeing
apparent
victory
within
his
grasp
the
german
admiral
signalled
his
fleet
to
full
speed
so
the
british
retreated
more
rapidly
suddenly
there
was
a
terrible
explosion
to
the
right
of
the
frank
and
jack
as
well
as
all
others
on
the
gazed
in
that
direction
the
battle
cruiser
suddenly
sprang
into
a
sheet
of
flame
and
parted
in
half
a
german
shell
had
struck
her
vitals
a
cry
of
despair
broke
from
the
british
as
the
the
greatest
british
ship
to
suffer
so
far
dived
beneath
the
waves

it
was
by
a
miracle
it
seemed
that
the

line
had
escaped
being
struck
in
their
vitals
by
the

flew
all
about
on

strewed

because

british
were
getting
the
worst
of

never

stand
up

had
been
the
german
policy
to
run
but
now
they
were
not
only
standing
up
to
the
british
but
were
giving
them
a
bad
thrashing
each
lad
realized
of
course
that
the
british
were
and
that
the
weight
of
guns
was
in
favor
of
the
enemy
but
in
spite
of
this
they
felt
that
the
enemy
should
be
defeated
they
cast
occasional
glances
to
the
west
hoping
to
catch
sight
of
the
main
british
fleet
which
should
be
drawing
near
now
but
at
nine
there
was
no
smoke
on
the
horizon
the
loss
of
the
had
been
a
hard
blow
to
the
british
as
the
others
retreated
now
the
germans
pressed
them
closely
a
shot
struck
the
in
the
forward
turret
exploding
her
guns
there
and
killing
the
gun
crews
the
effect
of
the
explosion
was
terrible
men
were
hurled
high
in
the
air
and
came
down
in
small
pieces
jack
in
the
forward
turret
of
the
a
moment
later
was
hurled
to
the
deck
as
a
german
shell
struck
one
of
the
guns
and
blew
it
to
pieces
the
lad
escaped
the
rain
of
steel
that
descended
a
moment
later
but
others
in
the
turret
were
not
so
fortunate
fully
half
the
men
there
were
killed
or
wounded
so
badly
that
they
could
fight
no
more
jack
sprang
to
one
of
the
guns
himself
it
was
loaded
quickly
the
lad
sighted
it
upon
one
of
the
enemy
ships
and
fired
he
watched
the
effect
of
this
shot
it
was
the
german
cruiser
at
which
he
had
aimed
he
saw
a
cloud
of
missiles
ascend
from
amidships
and
knew
that
the
shot
had
struck
home
jack
forgot
all
about
reporting
to
captain
raleigh
for
further
orders
and
as
the
battle
raged
he
continued
to
fire
one
of
the
big
guns
he
and
other
unwounded
british
tars
frank
had
not
seen
his
chum
for
an
hour
and
chancing
to
poke
his
head
into
the
forward
turret
he
was
surprised
to
see
jack
working
like
a
trojan
with
the
members
of
the
gun
crew
good
work
jack
keep
it
up
he
called
jack
looked
in
frank
direction
long
enough
to
wave
his
hand
then
turned
back
to
his
work
came
a
loud
british
cheer
what
happened
demanded
jack
of
the
man
next
him
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
to
make
himself
heard
above
the
din
of
battle
the
man
shook
his
head
do
know
he
shouted
back
unless
the
main
fleet
has
been
sighted
we
might
have
sunk
one
of
the
enemy
said
another
as
a
matter
of
fact
both
men
were
right
two
german
torpedo
boats
had
gone
to
the
bottom
almost
simultaneously
under
well
directed
british
shots
and
far
back
across
the
sea
a
flotilla
of
battleships
had
been
sighted
apparently
the
germans
had
not
yet
sighted
the
british
reinforcements
for
they
continued
to
press
their
foes
hard
four
british
torpedo
boats
had
been
sent
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
they
were
the
the
the
and
the
the
others
gave
slowly
before
the
enemy
and
a
moment
later
two
of
those
sank
the
and
the
there
now
remained
facing
the
entire
german
fleet
the
the
the
the
and
two
torpedo
boats
the
and
the
but
the
german
losses
had
been
great
the
had
been
sunk
so
had
the
and
the
the
had
gone
to
the
bottom
and
the
the
new
flagship
was
badly
crippled
as
another
german
torpedo
boat
sank
the
germans
slackened
their
pace
the
british
had
a
breathing
spell
but
the
battle
was
not
over
yet
the
second
german
squadron
had
now
approached
almost
close
enough
to
take
a
hand
in
the
battle
apparently
this
was
what
the
german
admiral
was
waiting
for
before
resuming
operations
it
was
plainly
evident
now
that
the
germans
had
sighted
the
approaching
british
fleet
but
at
that
distance
they
were
unable
to
make
out
its
strength
the
german
admiral
decided
to
continue
the
battle
if
he
could
do
so
with
any
hope
of
success
so
with
the
second
squadron
in
range
he
gave
the
command
to
advance
again
the
and
the
bore
the
brunt
of
this
next
attack
and
for
half
an
hour
it
seemed
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
two
ships
to
live
through
the
rain
of
shells
that
fell
all
about
them
but
live
they
did
and
they
gave
as
good
or
better
than
they
received
the
german
battleship
pierced
by
half
a
dozen
shells
at
almost
the
same
time
staggered
back
and
fell
out
of
line
but
the
british
had
no
mercy
on
her
shell
after
shell
they
poured
upon
her
and
at
last
she
sank
the
the
german
flagship
pressed
hotly
to
the
attack
although
struck
in
a
dozen
places
and
her
port
side
batteries
out
of
commission
she
continued
to
play
on
the
and
the
with
her
forward
turret
guns
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
fortunate
for
the
and
the
that
they
had
begun
to
retire
for
their
forward
turret
guns
had
been
silenced
and
the
only
pieces
that
they
could
now
bring
into
play
were
in
the
turrets
aft
a
shell
from
the
german
battleship
exploded
on
the
bridge
of
the
the
bridge
was
carried
completely
away
and
the
commander
of
the
ship
was
killed
as
were
half
a
score
of
other
officers
a
second
shell
struck
the
and
carried
away
her
steering
apparatus
absolutely
uncontrollable
now
the
drifted
toward
the
with
which
she
almost
collided
before
the
could
get
out
of
the
way
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
done
for
her
until
after
the
battle
at
any
rate
and
the
others
left
her
to
her
fate
drifting
as
she
was
the
continued
her
fire
and
of
a
sudden
she
put
a
shot
aboard
the
in
a
vital
spot
the
blew
up
with
a
terrible
roar
the
crew
of
the
cheered
and
waved
their
hands
to
their
companions
on
the
other
british
ships
apparently
this
was
more
than
the
german
admiral
had
bargained
for
with
his
whole
second
squadron
intact
and
the
british
apparently
helpless
he
had
thought
to
crush
these
few
ships
before
aid
should
reach
them
and
then
if
the
approaching
british
were
not
too
formidable
to
offer
them
battle
also
now
there
were
only
three
british
ships
in
line
the
the
and
the
and
these
were
really
not
fit
nor
able
to
continue
the
fight
but
the
men
fought
on
doggedly
none
of
the
others
had
thought
of
surrender
and
no
such
idea
entered
the
head
of
a
single
man
aboard
any
of
the
british
ships
help
was
at
hand
and
then
the
germans
would
get
the
thrashing
of
their
lives
the
men
told
themselves
they
would
keep
the
germans
busy
until
this
help
arrived
hardly
a
man
aboard
the
that
had
not
been
wounded
sweat
poured
from
their
faces
hands
and
body
as
they
continued
to
fight
their
guns
and
as
they
fought
they
shouted
and
yelled
encouragement
to
one
another
boom
there
was
a
different
tone
to
this
deep
voice
and
every
man
on
board
the
hard
pressed
british
ships
knew
what
it
meant
the
first
ship
of
the
main
british
fleet
had
come
within
range
and
had
opened
with
her
biggest
gun
other
new
voices
took
up
the
challenge
and
within
a
few
moments
the
roar
of
battle
was
at
its
height
once
more
still
a
considerable
distance
away
the
dimensions
of
the
approaching
british
fleet
now
became
apparent
to
the
german
admiral
he
had
thought
at
first
that
perhaps
the
newcomers
would
number
a
few
ships
attracted
by
the
sounds
of
battle
but
as
he
looked
at
the
formidable
array
now
bearing
down
on
him
he
knew
that
his
plans
whatever
they
were
had
been
frustrated
and
we
had
it
all
planned
so
carefully
he
said
between
clenched
teeth
he
strode
up
and
down
angrily
beating
the
palm
of
one
hand
with
a
knotted
fist
how
could
they
have
learned
of
it
he
cried
how
could
they
he
was
very
angry
an
officer
approached
him
shall
we
draw
off
sir
he
asked
and
pointed
to
the
fresh
british
ships
bearing
down
on
them
no
thundered
the
admiral
why
do
you
sink
those
three
ships
ahead
of
you
there
sink
them
i
tell
you
the
officer
saluted
and
moved
away
for
some
moments
the
german
admiral
continued
to
talk
to
himself
in
great
anger
then
he
suddenly
cooled
down
with
a
finger
he
summoned
the
officer
who
had
accosted
him
a
moment
before
the
officer
approached
and
saluted
i
forgot
myself
a
moment
ago
said
the
admiral
you
may
give
the
signal
to
retire
a
moment
later
the
big
german
ships
began
to
come
about
and
from
the
decks
of
the
the
and
the
there
came
loud
british
cheers
the
still
helpless
poured
shell
after
shell
upon
the
enemy
some
distance
away
still
the
british
fleet
was
approaching
in
an
endeavor
to
intercept
the
retreat
of
the
enemy
captain
raleigh
of
the
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
they
never
do
it
he
exclaimed
he
determined
upon
a
bold
step
he
gave
command
to
bring
the
about
then
disabled
as
his
ship
was
he
started
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
there
was
a
cheer
from
the
and
presently
the
head
of
that
vessel
also
came
about
she
started
after
the
chapter
xviii
the
sinking
of
the
queen
mary
perceiving
this
move
by
two
vessels
that
he
believed
the
same
as
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
so
far
as
fighting
purposes
went
the
german
admiral
became
very
angry
again
a
blight
on
these
english
he
exclaimed
do
they
know
when
they
are
beaten
certainly
it
seemed
not
if
the
admiral
version
that
they
were
defeated
was
correct
the
and
the
steamed
after
the
enemy
at
full
speed
jack
had
relinquished
his
duties
in
the
gun
turret
to
more
experienced
hands
and
had
joined
frank
on
deck
to
some
extent
the
forward
turret
had
been
repaired
and
was
now
in
condition
to
hurl
more
shells
after
the
fleeing
enemy
it
was
well
after
noon
when
the
germans
fled
and
as
the
two
british
ships
followed
close
on
the
heels
of
the
enemy
with
the
main
british
fleet
still
some
distance
back
one
of
those
deep
impenetrable
fogs
that
often
impede
progress
on
the
north
sea
suddenly
descended
it
was
indeed
a
boon
to
the
fleeing
germans
for
without
its
aid
there
is
little
likelihood
that
they
could
have
escaped
the
british
fleet
which
had
the
heels
of
the
enemy
but
the
fog
blotted
the
foe
completely
from
the
sight
of
the
main
british
fleet
and
even
from
the
decks
of
the
and
the
much
closer
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
the
whereabouts
of
the
germans
the
british
continued
to
fire
ahead
into
the
fog
but
with
what
result
it
was
impossible
to
tell
the
fog
became
more
dense
until
it
was
impossible
to
see
ten
yards
ahead
even
the
great
searchlights
on
the
vessels
failed
to
penetrate
the
gloom
well
i
guess
that
settles
it
said
frank
looks
that
way
jack
agreed
these
germans
are
pretty
slippery
customers
anyhow
it
impossible
to
catch
them
in
the
dark
this
fog
descended
as
though
it
were
all
made
to
order
for
them
frank
complained
pretty
hard
to
beat
a
fellow
when
the
elements
are
fighting
on
his
side
jack
admitted
i
imagine
captain
raleigh
will
give
up
the
chase
now
but
jack
was
wrong
though
as
it
turned
out
it
would
have
been
a
great
deal
better
for
all
concerned
if
the
chase
had
been
abandoned
at
that
point
after
some
conversation
with
captain
reynolds
of
the
by
wireless
captain
raleigh
announced
that
the
pursuit
would
be
continued
and
ordered
full
speed
ahead
in
the
deep
darkness
as
the
vessel
gathered
momentum
frank
exclaimed
i
do
like
this
i
feel
as
though
something
disastrous
was
about
to
happen
another
one
of
those
things
eh
said
jack
grinning
in
the
darkness
that
enveloped
them
what
things
i
never
can
remember
what
you
call
them
premonitions
i
mean
you
mean
a
hunch
said
frank
quietly
yes
that
just
what
i
have
a
hunch
take
it
to
captain
raleigh
maybe
he
will
give
you
something
for
it
said
his
friend
this
is
no
joking
matter
declared
frank
i
not
naturally
nervous
as
you
know
but
right
now
my
nerves
are
on
edge
just
the
after
effects
of
the
battle
said
jack
quietly
you
are
all
unstrung
i
unstrung
all
right
frank
admitted
but
the
battle
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
tell
you
something
is
going
to
happen
well
what
i
do
know
it
a
poor
hunch
unless
it
will
tell
you
what
is
going
to
happen
declared
jack
have
it
your
own
way
said
frank
but
wait
i
waiting
said
jack
cheerfully
the
also
following
captain
reynold
wireless
conversation
with
captain
raleigh
had
dashed
after
the
retreating
germans
at
full
speed
gradually
although
in
the
darkness
neither
their
commanders
nor
anyone
else
on
board
realized
it
the
and
the
dashing
ahead
at
full
speed
as
they
were
were
drawing
closer
together
at
every
turn
of
the
screws
frank
forebodings
were
about
to
bear
fruit
now
in
the
darkness
the
vessels
were
running
upon
about
even
terms
but
the
bows
were
both
pointed
toward
an
angle
that
would
drive
them
together
in
collision
about
a
mile
distant
although
none
realized
it
this
is
what
would
happen
unless
the
fog
lifted
suddenly
but
the
fog
did
not
lift
frank
try
as
he
would
could
not
shake
off
his
spell
i
tell
you
he
said
again
to
his
chum
something
is
going
to
happen
and
it
going
to
happen
soon
there
was
so
much
force
behind
frank
words
the
lad
seemed
in
such
deadly
earnest
that
jack
grew
alarmed
he
had
had
some
experience
with
these
premonitions
of
frank
what
is
it
he
asked
anxiously
i
wish
i
knew
said
frank
i
came
a
sudden
shout
forward
a
cry
from
the
bridge
instinctively
frank
threw
out
a
hand
and
grasped
jack
by
the
arm
another
series
of
startled
cries
the
tinkling
of
a
bell
in
the
engine
room
a
shock
as
the
engines
were
reversed
but
it
was
too
late
the
two
british
warships
came
together
with
a
terrible
crash
so
great
was
the
force
of
the
shock
that
frank
standing
on
the
far
side
was
thrown
clear
over
the
rail
but
the
lad
grasp
upon
his
chum
arm
was
so
tight
that
it
dragged
jack
along
with
him
and
the
two
boys
fell
into
the
sea
together
aboard
both
british
ships
all
was
confusion
now
with
startled
cries
men
rushed
on
deck
unable
to
see
in
the
dense
fog
they
became
panic
stricken
while
these
same
men
would
have
faced
death
bravely
in
battle
they
were
completely
bewildered
at
this
moment
in
vain
the
officers
aboard
both
vessels
sought
to
bring
some
semblance
of
order
out
of
the
confusion
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
electric
lighting
apparatus
on
both
vessels
there
was
no
light
the
fog
was
as
thick
as
ever
the
crews
stampeded
for
the
rails
but
at
the
rails
they
hesitated
for
they
did
not
wish
to
throw
themselves
into
the
great
unknown
next
came
the
stampede
for
life
preservers
men
fought
over
their
possession
whereas
in
cooler
moments
hardly
a
man
aboard
either
ship
who
would
not
willingly
have
given
the
life
preservers
to
companions
had
the
men
thrown
themselves
into
the
sea
immediately
it
is
likely
that
many
of
them
would
have
been
saved
but
their
hesitation
cost
them
dearly
in
vain
did
the
reversed
engines
of
both
ships
work
the
sharp
steel
bow
of
the
had
become
so
firmly
embedded
in
the
side
of
the
that
it
could
not
be
unloosened
and
so
the
two
battleships
sank
together
in
their
last
moments
as
they
had
been
when
they
had
faced
almost
certain
destruction
under
the
muzzles
of
the
great
german
guns
such
a
short
time
before
now
men
from
both
ships
hurled
themselves
into
the
sea
in
an
effort
to
cheat
the
waters
of
their
prey
commanders
and
officers
however
realizing
that
there
was
no
hope
of
life
even
in
the
sea
so
swiftly
were
the
ships
sinking
stood
calmly
on
the
bridges
and
awaited
the
end
for
they
realized
the
suction
would
be
so
strong
when
the
vessels
took
their
final
plunge
that
all
those
anywhere
near
in
the
water
would
be
drawn
under
captain
raleigh
sent
a
hail
across
the
water
in
a
loud
voice
are
you
there
reynolds
right
here
raleigh
came
back
the
response
there
is
no
hope
here
how
about
you
no
hope
here
either
was
captain
raleigh
answer
goodbye
then
shouted
captain
reynolds
goodbye
old
man
they
were
the
last
words
spoken
by
these
two
old
friends
who
had
been
boys
together
schoolmates
and
bosom
companions
suddenly
the
two
ships
took
their
final
plunge
men
still
on
board
those
of
the
crew
who
had
been
frightened
and
had
not
cast
themselves
into
the
sea
straightened
instinctively
as
they
felt
the
vessels
give
beneath
them
in
the
presence
of
death
when
they
knew
it
had
arrived
they
were
as
brave
and
courageous
as
in
the
midst
of
battle
so
there
was
silence
aboard
the
and
aboard
the
as
the
waves
parted
for
their
coming
all
on
board
officers
and
members
of
the
two
crews
as
well
stood
calmly
waiting
for
the
dark
waters
to
close
over
them
the
two
ships
made
a
last
desperate
effort
to
resist
the
call
of
the
sea
they
failed
a
moment
later
they
disappeared
from
sight
no
sound
came
from
the
depths
when
frank
and
jack
had
felt
themselves
in
the
water
the
latter
realizing
immediately
what
would
happen
if
the
ships
sank
before
they
had
put
some
distance
in
between
them
struck
out
swiftly
toward
what
he
felt
to
be
the
south
giving
frank
a
hand
as
he
did
so
the
latter
recovered
himself
a
moment
later
however
and
gasped
i
all
right
jack
let
me
swim
for
myself
all
right
said
jack
but
keep
close
beside
me
we
have
to
hurry
or
we
shall
be
pulled
under
by
the
suction
when
the
ships
sink
keeping
close
together
they
swam
with
powerful
strokes
and
so
it
was
that
they
were
out
of
harm
way
when
the
two
ships
disappeared
from
sight
with
a
deafening
roar
as
the
waters
closed
over
them
they
were
beyond
reach
of
the
suction
there
they
go
said
frank
sadly
and
it
is
only
a
miracle
that
prevented
us
from
going
with
them
said
jack
we
might
as
well
have
gone
as
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
north
sea
said
frank
nonsense
while
there
life
there
hope
they
swam
on
suddenly
jack
hand
came
in
contact
with
something
in
the
darkness
a
man
he
exclaimed
what
did
you
think
i
was
a
fish
came
the
reply
i
a
right
to
escape
as
well
as
you
who
are
you
asked
frank
at
that
moment
as
suddenly
as
it
had
descended
the
fog
lifted
jack
looked
at
the
other
man
in
the
water
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
harris
he
cried
chapter
xix
adrift
the
great
naval
battle
of
jutland
was
over
the
british
fleet
now
had
given
up
pursuit
of
the
fleeing
germans
and
beatty
paused
to
take
stock
of
his
losses
and
they
were
enormous
three
great
battle
cruisers
had
gone
to
the
bottom
the
of
tons
the
of
tons
and
the
of
tons
cruisers
lost
included
the
of
tons
the
of
tons
and
the
of
tons
the
giant
battle
cruiser
of
tons
had
been
badly
damaged
as
had
the
and
other
vessels
the
destroyers
turbulent
nestore
alcaster
fortune
sparrow
hawk
and
had
been
sunk
total
losses
ran
high
into
the
millions
and
in
the
number
of
men
above
the
german
losses
had
been
less
but
nevertheless
taking
into
consideration
damage
done
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
two
fleets
as
a
whole
the
enemy
had
sustained
the
harder
blow
the
british
fleet
still
maintained
control
of
the
north
sea
while
the
germans
because
of
their
losses
had
been
deprived
of
a
large
part
of
the
fighting
strength
of
their
fleet
the
british
in
spite
of
their
heavier
losses
would
recover
more
quickly
than
could
the
enemy
the
dreadnaught
was
the
largest
ship
lost
by
the
germans
it
was
of
tons
the
three
german
battleships
lost
the
the
and
the
were
each
of
tons
four
battle
cruisers
had
been
sent
to
the
bottom
they
were
the
the
the
and
the
each
of
tons
the
german
losses
in
torpedo
destroyers
had
been
particularly
heavy
an
even
dozen
having
been
sent
to
the
bottom
besides
this
the
enemy
had
lost
three
submarines
and
two
zeppelin
airships
besides
a
number
of
smaller
aircraft
in
men
the
germans
had
lost
slightly
less
than
the
british
and
so
both
british
and
germans
counted
the
battle
a
victory
the
germans
because
in
total
tonnage
sunk
they
had
the
best
of
it
the
british
because
they
held
the
scene
of
battle
when
the
fighting
was
over
and
because
the
enemy
had
retired
but
no
matter
with
which
side
rested
the
victory
there
was
no
gainsaying
the
fact
that
the
battle
of
jutland
was
the
greatest
naval
struggle
of
all
time
after
giving
up
pursuit
of
the
enemy
the
british
withdrew
damage
to
the
various
vessels
was
repaired
as
well
as
could
be
done
at
sea
and
the
ships
in
need
of
a
more
thorough
overhauling
steamed
for
england
where
they
would
go
into
the
bulk
of
the
british
fleet
however
still
in
perfect
fighting
trim
again
took
up
the
task
of
patrolling
the
north
sea
that
no
german
vessels
might
make
their
escape
from
the
fortress
of
heligoland
for
which
point
the
enemy
headed
immediately
after
the
battle
in
spite
of
the
severe
losses
of
the
germans
the
return
of
the
high
sea
fleet
to
heligoland
was
marked
by
a
grand
ovation
by
the
civil
population
various
reports
were
circulated
on
the
island
and
all
through
germany
for
that
matter
one
report
had
it
that
the
entire
british
fleet
had
been
sent
to
the
bottom
and
berlin
and
all
germany
rejoiced
but
as
time
passed
and
the
german
fleet
still
remained
secure
behind
its
fortifications
the
german
people
began
to
realize
that
the
victory
had
not
been
so
great
as
they
had
been
led
to
believe
they
knew
they
had
been
fooled
and
they
vented
their
anger
in
many
ways
street
riots
occurred
in
berlin
and
in
others
of
the
large
cities
the
people
demanded
to
be
told
the
facts
later
they
were
told
in
a
measure
but
even
then
they
were
denied
the
whole
truth
so
conditions
in
the
central
empires
grew
from
bad
to
worse
jack
and
frank
struggling
in
the
water
where
they
had
been
hurled
by
the
collision
of
the
and
the
were
glad
of
the
company
of
harris
who
had
bobbed
up
so
suddenly
alongside
of
them
in
the
darkness
harris
greeted
jack
exclamation
of
surprise
with
a
grin
yes
it
me
he
replied
discarding
his
grammar
absolutely
and
glad
to
see
you
fellows
again
question
is
what
are
we
going
to
do
now
well
you
know
as
much
about
it
as
i
do
declared
jack
i
any
idea
how
far
we
are
from
shore
but
i
am
afraid
it
is
farther
than
we
can
swim
all
three
cast
their
eyes
over
the
water
there
was
not
a
spar
nor
other
piece
of
wreckage
in
sight
but
jack
made
out
a
few
moments
later
some
distance
to
the
east
what
appeared
to
be
a
ship
of
some
sort
he
called
the
attention
of
the
others
to
it
suppose
we
might
as
well
head
in
that
direction
then
declared
harris
right
agreed
frank
he
struck
out
vigorously
and
the
others
did
the
same
it
was
a
long
ways
to
that
little
speck
on
the
water
and
the
lads
knew
that
if
the
vessel
were
moving
away
from
them
they
probably
would
be
lost
but
at
that
distance
the
vessel
seemed
to
be
stationary
so
they
did
not
give
up
hope
half
an
hour
later
frank
exclaimed
we
making
headway
ship
must
be
standing
still
well
i
wish
it
would
come
this
way
declared
harris
we
still
a
long
way
from
safety
it
probably
a
german
anyhow
said
jack
so
if
we
are
rescued
it
will
be
only
to
be
made
prisoners
that
better
than
being
made
shark
bait
said
harris
and
by
the
way
speaking
of
sharks
i
have
heard
that
there
were
many
of
them
in
these
waters
frank
shuddered
for
he
had
a
wholesome
disgust
for
the
man
eaters
hope
they
do
smell
us
he
said
and
so
do
i
agreed
jack
we
could
hope
to
fight
them
off
for
we
have
no
arms
i
got
a
knife
said
harris
but
i
am
afraid
i
would
know
what
to
do
with
it
should
a
shark
get
after
me
the
three
became
silent
saving
all
their
strength
for
swimming
an
hour
later
they
had
drawn
close
to
the
vessel
it
a
german
all
right
said
jack
regretfully
any
port
in
a
storm
said
harris
that
talk
of
shark
a
while
back
made
me
feel
sort
of
squeamish
i
want
to
get
out
of
this
water
they
continued
to
swim
toward
the
ship
wonder
what
the
matter
on
board
exclaimed
frank
suddenly
they
had
approached
close
enough
now
to
see
men
rushing
hurriedly
about
the
deck
hoarse
commands
carried
across
the
water
though
the
words
were
unintelligible
to
the
three
swimmers
at
that
distance
something
wrong
said
jack
quietly
that
what
i
call
hard
luck
declared
frank
here
we
think
we
have
reached
a
place
of
safety
and
something
goes
wrong
do
cry
till
you
hurt
youngster
said
harris
quietly
the
ship
is
there
and
we
pretty
close
to
it
those
fellows
aboard
german
or
english
are
bound
to
lend
us
a
hand
i
not
so
sure
about
that
declared
frank
well
i
am
said
harris
the
german
sailor
is
all
right
it
the
german
officer
who
makes
all
the
trouble
they
help
us
if
they
can
the
three
swimmers
were
a
short
distance
from
the
ship
now
jack
raised
his
voice
in
a
shout
help
he
cried
in
german
there
was
no
move
aboard
the
german
vessel
to
indicate
that
the
cry
had
been
heard
told
you
so
said
frank
do
cry
too
soon
youngster
said
harris
we
try
it
again
and
all
yell
together
they
did
and
this
time
their
cries
were
heard
several
men
aboard
the
german
vessel
stopped
their
rushing
about
and
gazed
across
the
sea
in
the
direction
of
the
swimmers
one
man
produced
a
glass
and
levelled
it
in
their
direction
then
he
turned
to
the
others
and
they
could
be
seen
to
gesticulate
excitedly
one
wants
to
save
us
and
the
others
do
declared
frank
for
some
moments
the
men
continued
to
argue
one
shook
his
finger
in
the
faces
of
the
others
and
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
swimmers
you
all
right
declared
frank
speaking
of
the
one
man
wish
i
were
there
to
lend
you
a
hand
but
i
afraid
the
others
are
too
much
for
you
at
this
juncture
the
man
who
opposed
the
others
produced
a
revolver
and
made
an
angry
gesture
he
was
ordering
the
others
to
the
aid
of
the
three
friends
in
the
water
by
jove
said
harris
he
all
right
i
like
to
be
able
to
do
him
a
good
turn
and
the
chance
was
to
come
sooner
than
he
expected
apparently
the
men
aboard
the
german
vessel
had
decided
to
obey
the
order
of
the
man
who
would
save
the
three
swimmers
a
boat
was
lowered
over
the
side
three
men
stood
ready
to
leap
into
it
the
hopes
of
the
three
friends
in
the
water
rose
high
but
they
were
shattered
a
moment
later
in
a
sudden
and
unexpected
manner
a
dull
rumbling
roar
came
suddenly
across
the
water
instantly
all
became
confusion
aboard
the
german
vessel
officers
shouted
hoarse
commands
and
struck
out
with
the
flat
of
their
swords
as
members
of
the
crew
rushed
for
the
rails
an
explosion
cried
frank
swim
back
quickly
the
others
understood
the
significance
of
that
strange
rumbling
aboard
the
german
vessel
as
quickly
as
frank
and
turning
rapidly
they
struck
out
as
fast
as
they
could
an
explosion
such
as
that
dull
roar
indicated
could
have
but
one
result
and
the
lads
knew
it
evidently
there
had
been
a
fire
on
board
that
accounted
for
the
strange
activities
of
the
men
on
the
ship
and
the
flames
had
reached
the
vessel
magazine
a
second
and
a
louder
roar
came
now
men
jumped
into
the
sea
by
the
scores
and
struck
out
vigorously
that
they
might
not
be
pulled
under
by
the
suction
when
the
ship
sank
then
there
came
an
explosion
even
louder
than
the
rest
the
great
ship
parted
in
the
middle
as
though
cut
by
a
knife
a
huge
tongue
of
flame
shot
high
in
the
air
hoarse
cries
from
aboard
screams
and
frightful
yells
split
in
twain
the
vessel
settled
fore
and
aft
a
second
huge
tongue
of
flame
leaped
into
the
sky
and
then
the
vessel
disappeared
beneath
the
sea
giant
waves
leaped
in
the
direction
taken
by
jack
frank
and
harris
the
sea
churned
angrily
about
them
and
the
three
had
all
they
could
do
to
keep
their
heads
above
water
then
the
water
calmed
down
frank
looked
around
and
there
not
fifty
feet
away
rolling
gently
on
the
waves
was
the
small
boat
so
recently
lowered
over
the
side
of
the
german
vessel
with
a
cry
to
the
others
to
follow
him
frank
turned
about
and
headed
for
the
boat
with
powerful
strokes
chapter
xx
friends
and
foes
there
was
reason
for
frank
haste
swimming
close
together
and
bearing
down
upon
the
boat
from
the
opposite
direction
almost
as
close
from
their
side
as
frank
was
from
his
four
german
sailors
were
racing
they
espied
frank
and
his
friends
at
almost
the
same
moment
frank
saw
them
one
uttered
a
cry
and
the
others
redoubled
their
efforts
to
beat
frank
to
the
boat
jack
and
harris
took
in
the
situation
quickly
it
was
then
that
jack
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
his
great
powerful
strokes
sent
him
skimming
through
the
water
as
lightly
as
a
denizen
of
the
deep
a
dozen
strokes
and
he
had
passed
frank
a
few
more
only
it
seemed
and
he
laid
hold
of
the
boat
and
drew
himself
aboard
standing
erect
he
looked
around
quickly
then
stepping
forward
he
picked
up
an
oar
he
moved
to
the
side
of
the
boat
where
the
germans
were
approaching
and
raised
the
oar
aloft
keep
off
there
he
cried
the
germans
uttered
exclamations
of
alarm
but
they
came
closer
keep
back
cried
jack
again
but
you
wo
let
us
drown
exclaimed
one
of
the
enemy
you
stay
there
until
my
friends
get
aboard
then
i
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
replied
jack
with
this
the
germans
were
forced
to
be
content
for
they
realized
that
jack
held
the
upper
hand
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
climb
aboard
while
the
lad
stood
there
brandishing
that
oar
frank
laid
hold
of
the
boat
a
moment
later
and
clambered
over
the
side
harris
was
close
beside
him
jack
called
a
consultation
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
those
fellows
in
here
he
said
but
shall
we
let
them
in
we
ca
see
them
drown
said
frank
still
there
is
no
telling
how
long
we
shall
be
here
is
there
sufficient
water
and
food
to
go
around
i
have
a
look
said
harris
enough
for
seven
of
us
for
about
one
drink
apiece
he
said
after
an
exploration
there
is
no
food
well
what
shall
we
do
said
jack
let
them
come
aboard
said
frank
we
ca
see
them
perish
without
raising
a
hand
to
help
them
and
yet
they
would
not
have
helped
us
a
short
time
ago
said
jack
one
man
would
have
helped
us
said
harris
perhaps
he
is
one
of
these
no
he
not
said
jack
i
would
know
him
in
a
moment
if
i
saw
him
i
obtained
a
good
look
at
his
face
let
them
in
anyhow
said
harris
all
right
said
jack
he
called
to
the
men
in
the
water
you
fellows
climb
aboard
here
one
at
a
time
and
when
you
get
in
remember
you
are
our
prisoners
any
foolishness
and
we
pitch
you
back
again
the
germans
offered
no
protest
and
climbed
into
the
boat
one
at
a
time
sit
in
the
back
there
said
jack
the
men
obeyed
now
said
jack
i
tell
you
where
we
stand
water
is
scarce
and
there
is
no
food
we
shall
have
to
make
for
shore
immediately
i
in
command
of
this
boat
and
you
will
have
to
obey
me
get
out
the
oars
and
row
as
i
tell
you
the
germans
grumbled
a
bit
but
they
obeyed
no
time
to
waste
said
jack
briefly
we
head
south
he
gave
the
necessary
directions
and
the
boat
moved
off
help
came
a
sudden
cry
from
the
water
jack
looked
in
the
direction
of
this
sound
a
single
head
came
toward
them
swimming
weakly
ship
your
oars
men
said
jack
there
came
a
grumble
from
one
of
the
germans
there
is
no
more
room
he
declared
no
agreed
a
second
there
is
not
enough
water
now
why
should
we
let
another
man
in
the
boat
stop
that
said
jack
sharply
cease
rowing
the
men
made
no
move
to
obey
jack
stood
up
in
the
boat
and
stepped
forward
did
you
hear
me
he
said
quietly
though
it
was
plain
to
frank
that
he
was
very
angry
cease
rowing
but
began
the
nearest
german
jack
wasted
no
further
time
in
words
his
left
arm
shot
out
and
he
grasped
the
nearest
german
by
the
coat
raising
him
quickly
to
his
feet
he
struck
him
heavily
with
his
right
fist
and
then
released
his
hold
the
man
dropped
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
lay
still
any
more
asked
jack
cease
rowing
the
remaining
three
germans
shipped
their
oars
without
a
word
although
each
bestowed
an
evil
glance
upon
the
lad
frank
catching
the
look
in
their
eyes
muttered
to
himself
they
bear
watching
harris
said
jack
that
man
in
the
water
is
the
one
who
would
have
saved
us
a
short
time
ago
he
seems
to
be
weak
slip
over
the
side
and
lend
him
a
hand
will
you
harris
did
so
without
question
and
a
moment
or
two
later
the
german
tumbled
into
the
boat
where
he
lay
panting
blood
streaming
from
an
open
wound
in
his
forehead
harris
climbed
back
in
the
boat
bandage
him
up
as
well
as
you
can
and
give
him
a
few
drops
of
that
water
said
jack
for
his
part
jack
stooped
over
the
german
soldier
he
had
so
recently
knocked
unconscious
and
raised
him
to
a
sitting
posture
reaching
over
the
side
of
the
boat
the
lad
wet
his
handkerchief
and
applied
it
to
the
german
head
soon
the
man
recovered
consciousness
a
drop
of
water
here
too
said
jack
quietly
say
said
harris
this
water
is
precious
scarce
we
need
it
ourselves
but
this
man
must
have
a
little
said
jack
pass
it
along
harris
did
not
protest
further
and
jack
allowed
the
german
soldier
to
moisten
his
tongue
now
get
back
to
your
oars
the
lad
commanded
the
german
did
as
commanded
and
soon
the
little
boat
was
leaping
lightly
over
the
waves
take
the
helm
frank
said
jack
frank
relieved
harris
who
had
been
performing
this
duty
got
your
pocket
compass
frank
asked
jack
yes
keep
your
course
due
south
then
all
right
sir
said
frank
with
a
smile
harris
said
jack
i
want
you
to
stand
guard
over
these
sailors
for
a
few
minutes
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
our
latest
arrival
i
be
with
you
in
a
few
minutes
harris
stepped
forward
ought
to
have
a
gun
i
suppose
he
said
i
guess
not
said
jack
you
and
i
together
should
be
able
to
hold
these
fellows
in
check
sure
unless
they
hit
us
over
the
head
with
an
oar
when
we
not
looking
but
one
of
us
must
always
be
looking
said
jack
quietly
well
that
not
a
bad
idea
i
keep
my
eyes
open
jack
moved
to
the
side
of
the
german
who
had
been
the
last
to
get
into
the
boat
his
wound
had
been
bound
up
as
well
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
and
he
sat
quietly
looking
out
over
the
water
what
vessel
was
that
asked
jack
was
the
reply
what
was
the
trouble
shot
pierced
our
boiler
room
in
the
battle
returning
we
were
lost
from
the
main
fleet
in
the
fog
our
wireless
would
work
fire
broke
out
and
we
were
unable
to
check
the
flames
when
they
reached
the
magazine
she
exploded
i
see
said
jack
it
fortunate
you
were
drawn
under
with
the
ship
i
was
said
the
german
briefly
what
exclaimed
jack
yes
i
was
drawn
under
i
thought
i
was
done
for
but
under
the
surface
of
the
sea
there
was
a
second
explosion
i
felt
myself
flying
up
through
the
water
and
then
i
shot
into
the
air
when
i
came
down
i
was
not
far
from
your
boat
i
called
for
help
by
jove
you
have
had
an
experience
few
can
boast
of
said
jack
i
would
care
to
go
through
it
nor
i
again
said
the
german
now
said
jack
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
the
nearest
way
to
shore
the
german
considered
i
am
not
a
navigator
he
said
i
was
only
a
minor
officer
aboard
the
but
i
heard
the
captain
say
we
were
almost
miles
from
the
nearest
coast
line
i
am
afraid
you
will
not
be
able
to
make
it
in
this
boat
if
your
water
is
as
scarce
as
you
say
by
jove
said
jack
we
got
to
make
it
we
do
want
to
drown
out
here
it
not
always
what
we
like
said
the
german
officer
sententiously
that
true
enough
agreed
jack
but
i
have
a
feeling
i
was
not
born
to
be
drowned
we
find
a
way
out
i
hope
so
however
should
you
go
ashore
directly
south
of
here
you
would
be
within
german
lines
and
you
would
be
made
a
prisoner
ca
help
that
said
jack
i
much
rather
be
a
live
prisoner
than
a
dead
sailor
the
german
smiled
in
spite
of
his
wound
which
it
was
plain
to
all
was
giving
him
great
pain
of
course
he
said
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
a
passing
ship
that
what
we
thought
before
said
jack
when
we
saw
your
vessel
we
thought
we
were
safe
but
you
see
how
it
turned
out
well
you
just
have
to
select
a
course
and
stick
to
it
said
the
german
by
the
way
these
men
of
mine
you
are
likely
to
have
trouble
with
them
in
our
present
situation
i
do
not
consider
that
we
are
enemies
so
if
the
worst
comes
you
may
count
on
me
to
help
you
thanks
said
jack
i
shall
remember
that
and
the
trouble
was
to
come
sooner
than
could
have
been
expected
one
of
the
german
soldiers
suddenly
laid
down
his
oars
i
want
a
drink
he
exclaimed
i
row
no
more
until
i
have
a
drink
chapter
xxi
a
fight
for
a
boat
as
by
a
prearranged
signal
all
four
of
the
germans
threw
down
their
oars
and
jumped
to
their
feet
harris
at
that
moment
in
spite
of
jack
warning
had
been
gazing
across
the
sea
absolutely
unconscious
of
his
surroundings
he
was
lost
in
thought
frank
at
the
helm
uttered
a
cry
of
warning
even
as
the
closest
german
leaped
for
harris
and
the
latter
wheeled
quickly
he
dodged
just
as
the
man
struck
out
with
a
knife
he
had
drawn
want
to
cut
me
up
do
you
muttered
harris
in
spite
of
the
wabbling
of
the
boat
he
fell
into
an
attitude
of
defense
the
old
fighting
form
that
had
won
for
him
the
championship
of
the
british
navy
in
the
squared
circle
he
did
advance
for
he
was
certain
of
his
footing
the
boat
pitched
so
but
he
felt
fully
able
to
take
care
of
himself
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
he
made
no
cry
for
help
he
knew
that
jack
must
have
heard
frank
cry
of
warning
he
knew
that
he
would
get
all
the
assistance
it
was
in
jack
power
to
give
and
he
felt
that
if
jack
were
unable
for
any
reason
to
aid
him
he
must
nevertheless
give
a
good
account
of
himself
when
harris
evaded
the
first
blow
the
german
caught
off
his
balance
pitched
forward
against
him
harris
was
almost
toppled
over
but
he
threw
his
left
arm
around
the
man
neck
and
aimed
a
vicious
blow
at
him
with
his
right
fist
the
german
knife
arm
because
of
harris
hold
dangled
helpless
at
his
side
in
vain
he
sought
to
get
it
in
position
where
he
could
drive
the
point
into
harris
body
harris
realized
the
man
intention
with
a
sudden
move
he
pushed
the
german
from
him
and
struck
out
as
he
did
so
the
man
staggered
back
reeled
unsteadily
and
toppled
over
the
side
of
the
boat
with
a
cry
the
three
other
germans
rushed
harris
at
that
moment
this
time
the
british
sailor
was
not
caught
off
his
guard
and
he
held
the
men
at
arm
length
for
several
seconds
meanwhile
jack
had
leaped
forward
crying
to
frank
as
he
did
so
keep
the
helm
frank
we
do
want
the
boat
overturned
frank
obeyed
much
as
he
would
have
liked
to
join
in
the
fight
jack
reached
harris
side
and
together
the
two
faced
the
three
germans
we
got
them
now
said
harris
quietly
men
said
jack
quietly
unless
you
return
to
your
oars
immediately
we
shall
be
forced
to
throw
you
overboard
there
was
a
snarl
from
the
three
men
suddenly
one
dropped
to
his
knees
and
seized
harris
by
the
legs
caught
off
his
guard
the
latter
fell
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
the
others
leaped
on
him
a
knife
flashed
in
the
hand
of
one
with
a
cry
jack
stooped
down
quickly
and
seized
the
man
wrist
even
as
the
point
of
the
weapon
would
have
been
buried
in
harris
back
the
lad
twisted
sharply
and
the
knife
went
flying
into
the
sea
you
would
would
you
cried
jack
he
jerked
the
man
to
his
feet
planted
two
hard
blows
on
his
chin
and
as
the
man
reeled
forward
clipped
him
once
more
one
two
three
backward
steps
the
man
took
and
then
pitched
over
the
side
of
the
boat
two
gone
exclaimed
jack
but
he
was
wrong
for
the
first
man
who
had
been
knocked
into
the
sea
had
been
revived
by
the
shock
of
the
cold
water
swimming
around
the
boat
unobserved
he
had
come
up
behind
frank
and
now
reached
up
and
grabbed
frank
by
the
coat
with
a
cry
of
alarm
the
lad
toppled
into
the
water
jack
heard
his
friend
cry
quickly
he
took
in
the
situation
harris
had
regained
his
feet
and
seemed
capable
of
disposing
of
the
two
remaining
germans
with
a
cry
to
harris
jack
leaped
over
the
side
some
distance
away
he
saw
frank
struggling
with
the
german
who
had
pulled
him
from
the
boat
and
he
swam
quickly
in
that
direction
i
coming
frank
he
called
hang
on
to
him
frank
was
doing
his
best
but
he
had
been
taken
by
surprise
and
the
advantage
was
with
his
opponent
the
german
hand
closed
about
the
lad
throat
and
he
was
slowly
choking
him
even
as
jack
came
abreast
of
the
struggling
figures
frank
threw
up
his
hands
and
the
two
disappeared
from
sight
jack
greatly
alarmed
dived
after
them
below
the
surface
of
the
water
his
hands
encountered
the
struggling
figures
he
seized
the
first
his
hand
came
in
contact
with
and
struck
upward
upon
the
surface
again
he
found
that
he
had
seized
hold
of
frank
keeping
his
fingers
clenched
tightly
in
frank
coat
that
the
lad
might
not
be
drawn
under
again
jack
aimed
carefully
at
the
face
of
the
german
which
now
was
close
to
him
and
struck
out
with
all
his
strength
instantly
the
hand
on
frank
throat
relaxed
and
the
german
sank
from
sight
by
the
force
of
the
impact
as
the
blow
landed
jack
knew
that
the
german
would
trouble
them
no
more
supporting
frank
with
his
left
arm
he
struck
out
for
the
boat
with
his
right
the
german
officer
leaned
over
the
side
and
lent
a
hand
in
dragging
frank
limp
body
over
the
side
jack
clambered
over
after
him
then
he
took
a
view
of
the
part
of
the
boat
where
harris
battled
with
two
of
the
enemy
both
of
the
latter
wielded
knives
and
it
was
plain
to
jack
that
harris
hesitated
to
come
to
close
quarters
with
them
as
he
had
no
assistance
at
hand
for
he
realized
that
should
he
be
overcome
the
men
would
have
little
trouble
of
disposing
of
frank
and
jack
as
they
tried
to
climb
back
in
the
boat
but
now
that
jack
was
able
to
come
to
his
assistance
again
harris
made
ready
for
a
spring
jack
saw
this
move
and
called
wait
a
minute
harris
harris
stayed
his
spring
and
jack
again
advanced
to
his
side
face
was
white
and
his
clothing
was
dripping
water
he
was
very
angry
and
his
fingers
clenched
and
unclenched
you
men
he
said
in
a
cold
voice
were
given
a
chance
for
your
lives
the
same
as
the
rest
of
us
now
you
will
either
throw
down
those
knives
or
die
one
made
as
if
to
obey
but
the
other
stopped
him
wait
he
cried
he
wants
us
to
throw
down
our
knives
so
they
can
overpower
us
to
the
other
this
seemed
good
reasoning
both
germans
still
wielding
their
weapons
drew
backward
slowly
jack
and
harris
advanced
as
slowly
after
them
drop
them
cried
jack
again
suddenly
one
of
the
germans
sprang
forward
and
aimed
a
vicious
blow
at
jack
with
his
knife
the
move
had
been
so
unexpected
retreating
as
the
men
had
been
that
jack
was
almost
caught
off
his
guard
he
sidestepped
quickly
however
and
avoided
the
knife
but
in
leaping
aside
he
had
jostled
harris
who
dodging
a
blow
aimed
by
the
second
german
now
was
thrown
off
his
balance
in
vain
he
tried
to
catch
himself
it
was
no
use
he
went
over
the
side
of
the
boat
uninjured
but
for
the
moment
unable
to
lend
jack
a
hand
with
two
foes
before
him
jack
realized
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
he
determined
to
take
the
offensive
himself
in
spite
of
the
odds
against
him
with
a
subdued
cry
of
anger
he
charged
the
two
germans
in
spite
of
the
violent
rocking
of
the
boat
he
caught
a
stabbing
wrist
with
his
right
hand
and
twisted
sharply
even
as
he
drove
his
left
fist
into
the
man
face
there
was
a
cry
of
pain
and
the
knife
clattered
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
again
and
again
the
lad
struck
paying
no
attention
to
the
second
man
then
with
an
extra
vicious
blow
he
knocked
the
german
clear
of
the
boat
into
the
sea
at
the
same
instant
harris
who
was
just
climbing
back
into
the
boat
uttered
a
cry
of
warning
and
jack
turned
just
in
time
to
dodge
a
knife
thrust
aimed
at
him
by
the
second
german
with
only
a
single
enemy
before
him
a
smile
broke
over
jack
face
he
called
to
harris
stay
back
harris
i
going
to
settle
with
this
man
myself
the
german
shrank
back
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
he
would
throw
down
his
knife
and
cry
for
mercy
but
if
he
had
such
a
thought
in
his
mind
he
discarded
it
he
sprang
at
jack
fiercely
again
jack
avoided
the
thrust
of
the
knife
and
caught
the
stabbing
wrist
in
his
right
hand
then
bringing
all
his
tremendous
strength
to
bear
he
stooped
slightly
and
jerked
with
his
hand
the
german
was
pulled
clear
of
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
ascended
into
the
air
then
he
shot
suddenly
forward
and
cleared
the
boat
by
a
good
five
feet
there
was
to
be
one
last
encounter
before
the
possession
of
the
boat
finally
came
into
the
hands
of
the
friends
undisputed
one
of
the
germans
revived
by
the
water
had
come
up
aft
and
laid
hold
of
the
boat
near
where
the
german
officer
sat
the
latter
saw
him
and
shifted
his
position
just
in
time
to
avoid
being
dragged
overboard
he
grew
suddenly
very
angry
you
murderous
dog
he
cried
rising
to
his
feet
he
stooped
quickly
and
seized
an
oar
before
the
man
in
the
water
could
realize
his
purpose
he
had
brought
the
oar
down
with
all
his
force
on
the
hand
that
grasped
the
boat
with
a
howl
of
pain
the
german
released
his
hold
his
fingers
shattered
by
the
force
of
the
blow
without
a
word
the
german
officer
dropped
the
oar
and
resumed
his
seat
jack
and
harris
now
approached
frank
side
and
the
former
bent
over
him
frank
was
just
regaining
consciousness
he
smiled
as
jack
asked
him
how
he
felt
and
asked
did
you
lick
them
all
you
bet
returned
jack
then
turned
to
harris
i
suppose
we
should
pick
up
some
of
those
fellows
if
we
can
we
ca
see
them
drown
before
our
eyes
you
too
soft
hearted
for
me
declared
harris
however
whatever
you
say
they
gazed
into
the
water
there
was
no
german
in
sight
be
ready
to
jump
in
the
moment
a
head
appears
said
jack
harris
nodded
and
the
two
stood
ready
to
give
aid
to
the
first
enemy
that
should
appear
ten
minutes
they
waited
fifteen
no
head
appeared
above
the
surface
of
the
water
i
guess
it
no
use
said
jack
slowly
at
last
they
gone
chapter
xxii
picked
up
by
the
enemy
it
was
dark
all
through
the
afternoon
jack
and
harris
had
rowed
untiringly
but
with
the
coming
of
nightfall
there
was
no
land
in
sight
nothing
to
do
but
keep
pulling
in
the
same
direction
said
jack
harris
nodded
all
right
he
said
but
i
getting
tired
i
have
to
rest
up
for
an
hour
or
so
let
me
row
awhile
said
frank
one
of
you
fellows
can
take
the
tiller
here
feel
all
right
asked
jack
first
rate
all
right
then
said
jack
you
and
harris
change
places
this
was
done
then
the
german
officer
spoke
it
about
time
for
me
to
take
a
hand
he
said
but
your
wound
protested
jack
well
it
still
pains
some
to
be
sure
but
the
sooner
we
get
to
shore
the
sooner
i
will
be
able
to
have
it
looked
after
it
better
to
row
awhile
than
to
remain
idle
suit
yourself
said
jack
i
am
a
bit
tired
we
change
places
they
did
so
and
the
little
boat
moved
on
in
the
darkness
do
know
where
we
are
said
jack
to
harris
but
it
seems
to
me
we
should
raise
land
with
the
coming
of
daylight
well
i
hope
we
do
was
harris
reply
i
getting
awfully
thirsty
but
i
hate
to
cut
into
that
water
supply
there
is
a
little
more
for
us
since
we
lost
our
other
passengers
said
jack
i
thirsty
myself
we
may
as
well
sample
that
water
he
produced
a
jug
and
each
took
a
cooling
draught
tastes
pretty
good
said
harris
smacking
his
lips
you
bet
agreed
jack
he
made
his
way
forward
and
gave
frank
and
the
german
officer
a
drink
enough
for
a
couple
of
more
rounds
he
said
shaking
the
jug
and
listening
to
the
splash
of
the
water
inside
oh
i
guess
we
enough
said
harris
however
it
is
well
to
use
it
sparingly
as
it
turned
out
they
had
an
ample
sufficiency
in
fact
more
than
they
needed
with
the
coming
of
daylight
frank
who
had
resumed
his
place
at
the
helm
a
short
time
before
uttered
an
exclamation
ship
he
cried
he
pointed
off
to
port
the
others
glanced
in
the
direction
indicated
and
then
raised
a
cheer
there
scarcely
more
than
a
mile
away
and
bearing
down
on
them
rapidly
came
a
german
already
they
had
been
seen
for
the
vessel
altered
its
course
slightly
jack
gave
a
sigh
sorry
it
not
a
british
ship
he
said
the
german
officer
was
forced
to
smile
and
i
glad
it
not
he
declared
for
if
it
were
it
would
be
capture
for
me
instead
of
you
but
there
are
three
of
us
and
there
is
only
one
of
you
protested
frank
well
it
the
fortune
of
war
said
the
german
the
misfortune
of
war
in
this
case
said
harris
the
german
warship
was
now
within
hailing
distance
and
a
voice
called
who
are
you
the
german
officer
acted
as
spokesman
and
shouted
back
german
officer
and
three
british
we
lower
a
boat
was
the
response
a
few
moments
later
a
boat
put
off
from
the
ship
manned
by
a
dozen
german
sailors
fifteen
minutes
later
the
lads
found
themselves
aboard
the
german
warship
where
they
were
immediately
conducted
to
the
cabin
of
the
commander
the
latter
turned
to
the
german
officer
for
an
account
of
what
had
happened
so
these
british
sailors
saved
you
he
said
he
turned
to
the
three
i
must
thank
you
in
the
name
of
the
emperor
he
said
quietly
now
if
you
will
give
me
your
paroles
i
shall
allow
you
the
freedom
of
this
vessel
the
three
friends
glanced
at
one
another
and
the
german
commander
smiled
i
can
assure
you
there
is
no
possibility
of
escape
he
said
in
that
event
said
jack
we
shall
give
our
paroles
until
we
reach
shore
that
is
sufficient
after
that
you
will
be
in
other
and
safe
hands
the
german
commander
summoned
a
minor
officer
to
whom
he
introduced
the
three
friends
you
will
see
that
they
are
provided
with
suitable
quarters
he
said
the
officer
saluted
and
motioned
for
jack
frank
and
harris
to
follow
him
a
few
moments
later
the
three
found
themselves
installed
in
comfortable
quarters
where
clean
linen
and
dry
outer
clothing
was
laid
out
for
them
you
got
to
give
them
credit
said
frank
they
do
things
up
in
style
it
seems
we
are
to
be
well
treated
no
reason
why
we
should
be
declared
jack
wonder
where
we
are
bound
anyhow
said
harris
do
know
said
frank
i
try
and
find
out
as
soon
as
we
can
go
on
deck
providing
they
allow
us
on
deck
the
commander
said
we
would
have
the
freedom
of
the
ship
returned
harris
so
he
did
hurry
and
dress
then
half
an
hour
later
refreshed
by
a
bath
and
food
the
three
made
their
way
on
deck
where
they
found
the
young
german
officer
who
had
escorted
them
to
their
cabin
they
approached
him
and
the
latter
received
them
cordially
wonder
if
you
would
tell
us
where
we
are
bound
asked
frank
with
a
smile
certainly
was
the
reply
our
destination
is
bremen
bremen
eh
said
jack
what
will
they
do
with
us
there
probably
turn
you
over
to
the
military
authorities
to
take
care
of
you
until
the
end
of
the
war
looks
like
our
fighting
days
are
over
said
harris
sadly
the
young
german
smiled
seems
to
me
you
should
be
rather
glad
of
that
he
returned
after
your
defeat
off
jutland
you
should
be
willing
to
cry
for
peace
defeat
exclaimed
frank
why
the
germans
got
the
worst
of
it
you
know
that
oh
no
we
did
said
the
young
officer
the
greater
part
of
the
british
fleet
was
sent
to
the
bottom
our
losses
were
insignificant
were
you
there
asked
frank
why
no
said
the
german
but
well
we
were
there
said
frank
therefore
we
know
something
about
it
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
saw
one
german
dreadnaught
two
battle
cruisers
and
four
cruisers
sunk
with
my
own
eyes
also
i
saw
half
a
dozen
destroyers
sent
to
the
bottom
and
two
zeppelins
shot
down
impossible
exclaimed
the
young
german
officer
the
official
report
of
the
battle
gives
our
losses
as
two
destroyers
and
a
single
cruiser
while
the
greater
part
of
the
british
fleet
was
sunk
where
is
the
german
fleet
now
asked
frank
back
in
heligoland
some
of
the
vessels
are
in
need
of
slight
repairs
why
did
they
keep
going
after
that
great
victory
frank
wanted
to
know
why
i
ca
say
probably
had
orders
not
to
proceed
too
far
immediately
i
can
tell
you
why
said
frank
i
wish
you
would
said
the
young
officer
the
reason
replied
frank
is
perfectly
simple
it
because
the
main
british
fleet
is
out
there
waiting
for
you
fellows
after
we
chased
your
fleet
back
but
you
did
chase
us
back
we
retired
when
the
battle
was
won
oh
you
retired
when
the
battle
was
won
eh
yes
that
what
the
official
report
says
but
it
does
say
who
won
the
battle
does
it
asked
frank
with
a
grin
in
which
his
friends
were
forced
to
join
the
young
officer
gazed
from
one
to
another
and
frank
continued
now
i
tell
you
something
you
do
seem
to
know
we
were
pursuing
the
german
fleet
when
two
of
our
vessels
crashed
in
the
fog
that
how
we
happen
to
be
here
now
but
i
tell
you
that
is
not
possible
protested
the
german
it
may
not
have
been
considered
possible
returned
frank
but
it
a
fact
all
the
same
you
mean
then
that
the
official
report
is
not
true
well
that
my
personal
opinion
of
it
frank
admitted
sir
exclaimed
the
young
german
drawing
himself
up
suddenly
you
have
insulted
the
german
navy
and
me
with
it
were
it
not
that
you
are
our
guests
aboard
this
warship
i
would
demand
satisfaction
look
here
exclaimed
frank
i
did
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
i
was
just
telling
you
the
facts
in
the
case
i
the
young
german
faced
him
angrily
your
half
apology
only
adds
to
the
insult
he
said
i
shall
leave
you
now
with
this
he
drew
himself
up
stiffly
turned
on
his
heel
and
stalked
away
frank
gazed
after
him
amusedly
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
exclaimed
you
should
have
known
you
could
convince
him
said
jack
the
three
friends
walked
along
the
deck
gazing
out
over
the
water
half
an
hour
later
as
they
were
about
to
go
below
frank
caught
sight
of
a
figure
in
the
uniform
of
a
german
lieutenant
who
was
eyeing
them
closely
there
was
something
familiar
about
that
figure
and
unconsciously
the
lad
gave
a
start
he
called
jack
attention
to
the
man
and
the
latter
seeing
that
he
was
the
subject
of
discussion
quickly
withdrew
i
seen
him
some
place
said
frank
and
so
have
i
jack
declared
there
is
some
thing
strangely
familiar
about
him
say
it
unpleasant
when
you
know
a
man
and
ca
place
him
let
hope
he
is
not
some
old
enemy
come
back
to
life
said
frank
quietly
as
they
returned
to
their
cabin
chapter
xxiii
an
unknown
friend
bremen
the
greatest
of
all
german
shipping
centers
and
before
the
outbreak
of
the
european
war
one
of
the
greatest
seaports
in
the
whole
world
even
on
the
third
day
of
june
when
the
german
warship
on
which
jack
frank
and
harris
were
prisoners
steamed
into
bremen
the
port
was
alive
with
activity
great
german
merchant
ships
useless
since
the
war
began
appeared
deserted
but
other
and
smaller
craft
dashed
hurriedly
hither
and
yon
why
all
the
excitement
was
frank
comment
as
the
three
stood
well
forward
while
the
warship
steamed
through
the
harbor
several
reasons
i
guess
said
jack
one
is
that
half
of
these
small
vessels
ply
between
bremen
and
scandinavian
ports
in
spite
of
the
british
blockade
and
the
other
reason
probably
is
the
fact
that
the
city
is
celebrating
the
great
naval
victory
naval
victory
sure
the
battle
of
jutland
the
german
people
have
been
told
that
the
german
fleet
won
and
now
the
people
are
celebrating
see
all
those
flags
why
else
would
they
be
displayed
so
profusely
because
germany
is
at
war
said
frank
oh
no
they
would
you
remember
we
were
in
hanover
once
while
the
war
was
in
progress
you
did
see
all
those
flags
about
like
that
i
guess
you
right
at
that
moment
a
german
officer
approached
the
three
friends
i
something
of
interest
to
show
you
he
said
something
that
will
be
of
interest
to
all
the
world
presently
we
shall
be
glad
to
see
it
whatever
it
may
be
replied
jack
courteously
look
over
the
side
there
said
the
german
pointing
do
you
see
that
long
low
shape
in
the
water
why
yes
said
frank
looks
like
a
submarine
that
what
it
is
can
you
make
out
the
name
the
three
friends
peered
at
the
object
closely
frank
spelled
it
out
yes
the
replied
the
german
officer
and
within
a
month
the
whole
world
will
be
talking
about
her
what
she
going
to
do
asked
frank
sink
the
whole
british
fleet
the
german
officer
smiled
no
he
replied
quietly
the
will
be
the
first
of
a
fleet
of
merchant
submarines
to
ply
between
bremen
and
the
united
states
what
exclaimed
jack
in
the
utmost
surprise
you
mean
that
submarine
will
try
and
run
the
english
channel
and
make
for
the
united
states
exactly
but
it
impossible
said
frank
not
at
all
returned
the
german
you
may
remember
that
german
submarines
made
their
way
to
the
dardanelles
safely
the
only
difference
will
be
that
the
will
go
unarmed
she
will
carry
a
cargo
of
dyestuffs
and
other
commodities
of
which
the
united
states
is
in
need
well
she
may
try
it
but
i
do
believe
she
get
there
said
harris
nor
i
declared
jack
but
frank
was
so
sure
an
american
he
had
not
the
strong
prejudice
of
his
two
companions
it
will
be
a
great
feat
if
she
can
accomplish
it
the
lad
said
it
will
indeed
said
the
german
and
she
will
accomplish
it
one
thing
though
said
frank
she
wo
be
able
to
carry
a
very
valuable
cargo
she
too
small
she
carry
a
cargo
worth
more
than
said
the
german
officer
and
in
payment
she
will
bring
back
gold
and
securities
and
you
may
know
that
germany
is
in
need
of
cash
by
jove
exclaimed
frank
we
have
to
admit
that
you
germans
are
progressive
we
may
not
like
to
admit
it
but
it
a
fact
all
the
same
i
thank
you
said
the
german
with
a
low
bow
well
we
obliged
to
you
for
showing
us
the
at
all
events
said
jack
and
i
want
to
say
that
if
by
any
chance
she
does
reach
the
united
states
you
may
be
well
proud
of
her
i
second
that
declared
harris
again
the
german
bowed
low
now
said
frank
as
we
have
passed
beyond
sight
of
the
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
what
is
to
be
done
with
us
as
it
happens
i
can
was
the
reply
i
heard
the
captain
inform
lieutenant
von
ludwig
that
you
will
be
put
in
his
charge
he
has
instructions
to
see
you
safe
in
the
hands
of
the
military
authorities
in
berlin
where
most
of
the
captured
british
and
french
officers
are
being
held
pretty
tough
jack
said
frank
the
german
officer
overheard
this
remark
although
he
perhaps
did
not
catch
the
exact
meaning
you
will
be
well
treated
he
said
i
no
doubt
of
that
declared
jack
the
german
officer
left
them
jack
turned
to
frank
say
he
exclaimed
are
you
thinking
of
turning
german
directly
what
that
demanded
frank
in
surprise
i
just
wondered
when
you
were
going
to
take
up
the
arms
for
the
kaiser
the
way
you
have
been
praising
all
things
german
recently
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
you
the
for
instance
frank
smiled
i
just
do
happen
to
be
a
john
bull
he
replied
hard
headed
am
i
exclaimed
jack
i
a
notion
to
shake
some
of
that
german
sympathy
out
of
you
you
know
i
have
any
german
sympathies
said
frank
but
i
believe
in
giving
credit
where
credit
is
due
well
there
is
no
credit
due
there
you
know
that
is
just
some
cock
and
bull
story
the
germans
will
never
dare
such
a
thing
i
not
so
sure
said
frank
quietly
well
it
will
never
get
across
the
sea
if
the
attempt
is
made
maybe
not
maybe
yes
said
frank
with
a
grin
well
what
jack
might
have
replied
frank
never
learned
for
at
that
moment
another
german
officer
accosted
them
he
was
the
man
who
was
so
strangely
familiar
to
jack
and
frank
you
will
be
ready
to
accompany
me
the
moment
we
dock
sirs
he
said
all
right
frank
agreed
we
be
ready
they
descended
to
their
cabin
where
they
donned
the
clothing
they
had
worn
when
picked
up
from
the
sea
then
they
returned
on
deck
the
great
warship
now
was
nearing
the
dock
backing
in
slowly
she
drew
close
to
the
pier
and
then
finally
her
engines
ceased
a
gangplank
was
lowered
and
men
began
to
disembark
the
officer
who
was
to
conduct
the
three
prisoners
to
berlin
tapped
jack
on
the
shoulder
whenever
you
are
ready
he
said
quietly
we
ready
now
returned
jack
then
precede
me
ashore
was
the
reply
by
the
way
i
might
as
well
advise
you
that
there
is
no
use
of
attempting
to
escape
i
have
my
gun
handy
and
will
drop
either
of
you
at
the
first
false
step
do
worry
we
have
no
intention
of
trying
to
escape
not
right
here
in
broad
daylight
said
frank
very
good
let
us
move
slowly
they
made
their
way
down
the
gang
plank
and
ashore
there
a
line
of
automobiles
waited
the
officer
motioned
his
prisoners
into
the
largest
of
these
and
gave
instructions
to
the
driver
he
took
a
seat
beside
jack
as
the
automobile
started
down
the
street
jack
glanced
at
his
captor
sharply
surely
i
have
seen
you
some
place
before
sir
the
lad
said
the
officer
shrugged
his
shoulders
who
knows
he
said
and
became
silent
deuced
uncommunicative
sort
of
a
fellow
said
jack
to
himself
but
i
know
i
come
in
contact
with
him
some
place
it
may
come
to
me
later
the
automobile
drew
up
in
front
of
a
large
stone
house
and
the
officer
motioned
his
prisoners
out
he
spoke
to
his
chauffeur
keep
your
gun
handy
and
follow
me
he
instructed
the
driver
nodded
and
stepped
alongside
the
officer
who
motioned
the
three
friends
up
the
steps
ahead
of
him
inside
he
motioned
them
into
a
parlor
and
then
dismissed
his
chauffeur
now
he
said
i
want
your
promises
not
to
try
to
escape
sorry
sir
but
we
ca
do
that
replied
frank
quietly
come
do
be
fools
exclaimed
their
captor
sharply
he
walked
to
the
door
and
peered
out
then
walking
close
to
frank
and
jack
he
said
quietly
if
you
will
give
me
your
promises
to
make
no
attempt
to
escape
before
tomorrow
night
i
shall
not
have
you
guarded
both
lads
started
back
in
surprise
for
the
man
had
spoken
in
english
and
without
the
trace
of
an
accent
great
scott
exclaimed
frank
you
must
be
an
englishman
the
man
laid
a
finger
to
his
lips
he
warned
walls
have
ears
you
know
so
you
do
know
me
the
lads
gazed
at
him
closely
i
know
i
have
seen
you
some
place
declared
jack
so
have
i
said
frank
and
to
think
that
they
do
know
me
said
the
man
half
to
himself
then
he
addressed
them
again
i
guess
it
is
as
well
that
you
have
not
recognized
me
but
did
i
not
know
you
so
well
i
would
not
say
what
i
am
about
to
say
that
is
this
i
am
an
englishman
and
i
am
here
on
an
important
business
tomorrow
night
i
shall
return
to
england
give
me
your
words
to
remain
quiet
here
until
then
in
the
meantime
not
trying
to
learn
my
identity
and
you
shall
all
go
with
me
is
it
a
bargain
frank
looked
at
the
man
sharply
was
he
fooling
them
well
the
lad
decided
they
had
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
very
well
the
lad
said
you
have
my
promise
not
to
attempt
to
escape
before
tomorrow
night
and
mine
said
jack
and
mine
declared
harris
very
well
then
i
shall
leave
you
for
the
moment
the
man
stalked
from
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
chapter
xxiv
the
boys
become
uneasy
for
some
moments
after
the
officer
had
taken
his
departure
there
was
silence
in
the
room
then
harris
exclaimed
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
well
i
do
hardly
know
what
to
think
of
it
jack
replied
frank
took
most
of
the
talking
on
himself
when
he
gave
his
parole
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
do
likewise
that
what
i
thought
otherwise
i
would
have
given
mine
said
harris
it
may
not
be
too
late
to
call
him
back
and
tell
him
so
said
frank
i
did
the
talking
because
neither
of
you
seemed
to
want
to
do
it
you
did
have
to
give
your
parole
unless
you
wanted
to
i
did
ask
you
to
do
it
come
now
do
get
mad
frank
said
jack
i
not
mad
i
just
telling
you
what
i
think
certainly
it
can
do
us
no
harm
we
have
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
that
so
too
when
you
stop
to
think
of
it
harris
agreed
well
i
stopped
to
think
of
it
said
frank
you
fellows
did
that
the
difference
but
who
on
earth
can
he
be
exclaimed
harris
he
seems
to
know
you
two
all
right
there
is
something
strangely
familiar
about
him
said
frank
but
i
ca
place
him
nor
i
admitted
jack
though
as
you
say
there
is
something
familiar
about
him
seems
to
me
that
if
i
knew
a
man
i
could
tell
you
who
he
was
said
harris
seems
so
to
me
too
declared
frank
but
i
ca
well
said
jack
i
not
as
credulous
as
you
are
frank
i
wager
he
is
not
doing
this
to
help
us
out
i
bet
we
land
in
berlin
and
stay
there
until
the
end
of
the
war
by
jove
let
hope
not
said
harris
still
all
things
considered
i
of
your
way
of
thinking
if
he
was
telling
the
truth
said
jack
he
would
have
let
us
know
who
he
is
there
was
no
reason
for
telling
us
he
was
english
and
then
concealing
his
identity
i
ca
see
any
reason
frank
admitted
but
at
the
same
time
i
believe
he
was
telling
the
truth
the
conversation
languished
frank
curled
himself
up
on
a
sofa
at
the
far
side
of
the
room
and
sought
a
little
rest
jack
dozed
in
his
chair
harris
also
could
hardly
keep
his
eyes
open
they
were
still
in
this
condition
when
the
door
opened
several
hours
later
and
their
captor
again
entered
the
room
he
walked
quickly
across
the
room
and
shook
jack
hello
said
the
latter
sleepily
back
eh
frank
awoke
at
the
sound
of
jack
voice
and
harris
also
opened
his
eyes
i
had
a
little
work
that
had
to
be
disposed
of
immediately
said
their
captor
which
is
the
reason
i
left
you
so
abruptly
i
can
show
you
a
place
to
sleep
now
he
led
the
way
from
the
room
and
upstairs
there
he
ushered
the
three
into
a
large
well
appointed
room
which
contained
two
beds
only
two
beds
he
said
but
it
the
best
i
can
do
two
of
you
can
bunk
together
anything
just
so
it
soft
said
frank
i
tired
out
then
you
had
all
better
turn
in
at
once
said
their
captor
i
have
much
work
to
do
it
is
probable
that
i
shall
not
be
back
again
until
some
time
tomorrow
night
make
yourselves
at
home
you
are
alone
in
the
house
you
will
find
cold
meats
bread
and
some
other
things
in
the
pantry
down
stairs
remain
here
until
i
come
very
well
sir
said
frank
and
you
say
we
shall
leave
here
tomorrow
night
yes
unless
something
develops
to
interfere
with
my
plans
all
right
sir
we
shall
remain
here
until
you
come
tomorrow
night
but
that
is
as
long
as
our
paroles
hold
good
sir
after
that
we
shall
escape
if
it
is
humanly
possible
i
will
be
back
before
midnight
tomorrow
was
their
captor
reply
until
that
time
goodbye
one
thing
stay
in
the
house
and
keep
the
blinds
drawn
i
do
not
wish
to
attract
attention
to
this
house
very
well
sir
said
frank
the
man
took
a
last
careful
glance
around
the
room
and
then
disappeared
well
he
gone
again
said
jack
he
may
be
telling
the
truth
and
he
may
not
but
one
thing
sure
these
beds
look
pretty
comfortable
going
to
make
use
of
one
right
now
he
undressed
quickly
and
slipped
between
the
sheets
frank
and
harris
followed
his
example
all
were
up
bright
and
early
the
next
day
greatly
refreshed
they
found
food
in
the
pantry
as
their
captor
had
told
them
they
would
it
was
a
tedious
day
confined
as
they
were
and
the
time
passed
slowly
but
dusk
descended
at
last
he
should
be
here
at
any
time
now
said
frank
the
others
said
nothing
but
when
nine
had
come
and
gone
even
frank
became
uneasy
do
see
what
is
detaining
him
he
said
nor
i
if
he
really
meant
to
come
back
said
jack
eleven
and
still
their
captor
had
not
returned
he
said
he
would
be
back
by
midnight
said
frank
he
said
lots
of
things
said
jack
but
they
did
make
the
same
impression
on
me
they
seem
to
have
made
on
you
i
do
believe
he
is
coming
i
tell
you
what
i
think
said
harris
i
believe
he
expected
us
to
make
a
break
for
liberty
before
now
the
house
probably
is
surrounded
and
if
we
start
out
the
door
we
shall
most
likely
be
shot
down
by
jove
i
would
be
surprised
if
you
had
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
jack
declared
nonsense
said
frank
what
would
be
the
advantage
of
a
plan
like
that
well
i
do
know
but
there
is
something
queer
about
this
business
declared
jack
eleven
thirty
passed
and
still
no
sign
of
their
captor
jack
and
harris
had
kept
up
a
steady
flow
of
conversation
regarding
the
probable
fate
that
was
in
store
for
them
if
they
poked
their
heads
outside
the
door
and
at
last
jack
rose
to
his
feet
well
he
said
quietly
there
is
no
need
of
staying
here
we
may
as
well
make
a
break
for
it
chances
are
if
we
are
quick
enough
we
can
get
into
the
open
without
being
shot
down
not
in
these
clothes
said
harris
true
enough
we
have
a
look
for
other
clothing
what
do
you
say
frank
i
not
convinced
yet
the
man
is
not
coming
back
said
frank
but
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
we
hunt
up
some
other
clothes
and
get
into
them
then
we
wait
until
twelve
if
he
has
not
returned
by
that
time
i
with
you
fair
enough
said
harris
come
on
the
three
made
their
way
upstairs
where
they
started
a
thorough
search
of
the
house
and
at
last
jack
ran
onto
a
closet
in
which
were
stored
half
a
dozen
suits
of
civilian
clothes
he
called
the
others
all
right
if
they
fit
said
harris
fortunately
they
did
fit
and
fifteen
minutes
later
the
three
were
garbed
in
plain
citizens
attire
they
left
their
uniforms
in
the
room
where
they
had
changed
now
to
see
if
we
can
find
a
few
guns
said
jack
again
they
searched
the
house
frank
was
the
first
to
find
a
weapon
there
were
two
revolvers
in
a
drawer
of
a
writing
desk
in
the
parlor
and
with
them
was
a
goodly
supply
of
ammunition
frank
gave
one
of
the
guns
to
jack
we
ought
to
be
able
to
find
one
more
said
harris
i
got
to
have
a
gun
they
ransacked
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
and
at
length
frank
came
across
another
weapon
harris
gave
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
let
divide
up
that
ammunition
now
he
said
this
was
done
and
the
three
returned
to
the
parlor
frank
glanced
at
his
watch
five
minutes
to
twelve
he
said
we
wait
until
midnight
and
not
a
second
longer
to
this
the
others
agreed
i
guess
you
were
right
after
all
frank
told
his
companions
still
i
ca
understand
this
thing
at
all
you
probably
understand
it
better
when
you
stick
your
head
out
the
door
and
a
bullet
hits
close
to
it
said
harris
grimly
no
i
do
believe
there
is
anything
like
that
going
to
happen
frank
declared
maybe
he
was
detained
and
could
get
back
on
time
when
he
gets
back
he
find
us
missing
said
harris
he
will
unless
he
hurries
frank
agreed
the
minutes
passed
slowly
but
at
last
the
hands
of
frank
watch
pointed
to
midnight
the
lad
closed
the
case
of
his
watch
with
a
snap
and
rose
to
his
feet
he
examined
his
revolver
carefully
to
make
sure
it
was
in
working
order
and
then
said
time
up
may
as
well
be
moving
the
three
advanced
cautiously
to
the
front
door
behind
the
house
was
perfectly
dark
careful
when
you
open
the
door
frank
jack
warned
stoop
down
there
is
no
telling
what
may
be
lurking
out
there
frank
heeded
this
warning
stooping
he
opened
the
door
threw
it
wide
and
looked
out
coast
clear
he
announced
he
was
about
to
step
out
when
the
sound
of
hurried
footsteps
came
to
his
ears
wait
a
minute
frank
whispered
some
one
coming
a
man
appeared
down
the
street
he
came
nearer
frank
gave
an
exclamation
of
satisfaction
come
on
back
to
the
parlor
he
whispered
here
he
comes
now
chapter
xxv
toward
freedom
jack
and
harris
obeyed
frank
injunction
and
the
three
flitted
back
to
the
parlor
silently
a
moment
later
the
front
door
opened
softly
and
directly
the
officer
appeared
in
the
parlor
door
i
came
almost
not
getting
here
he
said
with
a
smile
did
you
get
tired
waiting
so
tired
said
frank
that
we
were
just
about
to
leave
when
i
chanced
to
see
you
coming
down
the
street
so
well
you
would
have
had
a
hard
time
escaping
i
am
afraid
now
my
way
it
will
be
easier
i
have
had
my
means
of
escape
laid
out
ever
since
i
arrived
here
unless
something
unforeseen
occurs
we
should
be
able
to
get
away
without
difficulty
i
am
sure
i
hope
so
declared
frank
their
captor
surveyed
the
three
closely
i
see
you
are
all
ready
he
said
changed
your
clothes
eh
i
hope
you
did
think
we
were
going
prowling
about
the
street
in
our
british
uniforms
said
jack
hardly
by
any
chance
did
you
find
weapons
too
frank
hesitated
for
a
moment
he
debated
what
was
best
to
answer
however
the
odds
were
now
three
against
one
so
he
replied
yes
we
have
a
gun
apiece
good
then
we
may
as
well
be
moving
the
car
should
be
here
in
ten
minutes
at
the
latest
you
see
that
why
i
was
late
had
a
blowout
aways
back
we
had
to
come
in
on
foot
i
sent
my
driver
for
another
car
while
i
hurried
here
for
i
was
afraid
that
you
might
do
something
rash
you
see
i
know
more
about
you
than
you
think
i
do
i
wish
you
would
tell
us
who
you
are
sir
said
jack
all
in
good
time
replied
the
officer
with
a
smile
all
in
good
time
came
a
from
without
there
our
car
said
the
officer
quietly
come
along
without
a
word
the
others
followed
him
through
the
dark
hall
out
the
door
and
down
the
steps
where
they
climbed
into
the
car
in
the
rear
seat
their
captor
taking
his
seat
with
the
driver
the
automobile
started
immediately
they
rode
along
slowly
for
perhaps
an
hour
and
they
came
to
what
the
lads
recognized
immediately
as
the
water
front
their
captor
called
a
halt
and
climbed
out
motioning
the
lads
to
follow
him
immediately
they
had
alighted
the
automobile
drove
away
straight
down
to
the
water
their
captor
led
the
way
jack
whispered
to
frank
you
ca
tell
me
we
are
going
to
get
away
from
here
as
easily
as
all
this
was
frank
reply
jack
thereafter
maintained
a
discreet
silence
at
the
edge
of
the
pier
their
captor
pointed
to
a
small
rowboat
in
the
water
we
get
in
here
he
said
they
did
so
and
a
moment
later
they
were
being
rowed
across
the
water
by
a
man
frank
recognized
as
a
german
sailor
the
thing
was
becoming
more
complicated
a
short
distance
ahead
there
now
loomed
up
what
appeared
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
motorboat
of
considerable
size
the
rowboat
approached
this
craft
and
the
officer
motioned
his
three
companions
to
follow
him
aboard
they
did
so
aboard
they
saw
that
the
vessel
upon
the
deck
of
which
they
stood
was
in
reality
a
pleasure
yacht
now
converted
into
a
vessel
of
war
a
look
at
her
graceful
outlines
and
long
slender
body
told
all
three
that
the
vessel
was
built
for
speed
their
captor
had
halted
and
waited
for
the
three
to
come
up
with
him
follow
me
below
he
whispered
i
do
the
talking
agree
with
whatever
i
say
and
listen
carefully
to
my
every
word
the
three
friends
obeyed
below
they
were
ushered
into
what
proved
to
be
the
commander
cabin
an
officer
in
the
dress
of
a
lieutenant
commander
of
the
german
navy
rose
and
greeted
the
boys
captor
with
a
salute
and
an
extended
hand
their
captor
grasped
the
hand
commander
von
ludwig
i
take
it
said
the
commander
of
the
vessel
von
ludwig
bowed
the
same
sir
he
replied
i

here
a
paper
that
gives
me
command
of
your
vessel

ordered
to
report
to
berlin

once

have
been
expecting

the
reply
i

once
if
your
boatman
is
still
near
i
ordered
him
to
await
you
was
von
ludwig
reply
the
commander
of
the
german
vessel
glanced
at
von
ludwig
three
companions
your
officers
he
asked
yes
your
officers
will
be
relieved
in
the
morning
very
well
sir
then
i
shall
leave
you
a
safe
and
successful
voyage
to
you
sir
the
same
to
you
sir
von
ludwig
motioning
to
his
companions
to
remain
in
the
cabin
until
his
return
went
on
deck
with
the
departing
commander
a
few
moments
later
the
latter
was
being
rowed
ashore
for
the
space
of
several
seconds
von
ludwig
gazed
after
him
a
peculiar
smile
lighting
up
his
face
as
he
murmured
if
you
only
knew
what
a
time
i
had
getting
the
paper
i
just
gave
you
you
would
not
be
going
so
serenely
about
your
business
right
now
oh
well
he
threw
open
his
arms
with
a
gesture
and
descended
to
his
cabin
now
he
said
to
jack
frank
and
harris
the
first
thing
we
must
do
is
to
secure
the
crew
and
the
officers
of
this
vessel
the
crew
i
happen
to
know
numbers
only
ten
men
there
are
two
officers
we
shall
have
to
overcome
them
and
how
are
we
going
to
work
the
ship
sir
asked
jack
von
ludwig
glanced
at
the
lad
sharply
you
would
be
a
better
sailor
sir
if
you
would
follow
orders
without
question
he
said
sharply
then
added
more
calmly
however
i
shall
tell
you
for
i
can
see
none
of
you
trust
me
fully
i
have
my
own
crew
of
five
men
coming
aboard
within
the
hour
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
jack
that
all
right
said
von
ludwig
now
follow
me
the
others
did
as
ordered
before
a
door
not
far
from
the
cabin
von
ludwig
stopped
in
there
you
will
find
the
first
officer
he
said
he
motioned
to
frank
and
jack
get
him
and
get
him
quietly
the
lads
nodded
their
understanding
and
von
ludwig
signalled
harris
to
follow
him
jack
laid
his
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
and
turned
it
gently
the
door
flew
open
without
a
sound
find
the
light
switch
frank
jack
whispered
frank
hand
felt
carefully
over
the
wall
turn
it
on
when
i
give
the
word
said
jack
i
may
need
to
see
what
i
am
doing
all
right
but
be
careful
jack
slowly
jack
tiptoed
across
the
room
where
he
could
dimly
see
a
form
stretched
across
a
bunk
bending
over
the
figure
jack
raised
a
hand
and
then
called
to
frank
lights
frank
instantly
frank
threw
the
switch
and
then
sprang
forward
to
lend
jack
a
hand
should
it
be
necessary
but
his
assistance
was
not
needed
jack
fist
rose
and
fell
once
and
the
form
in
the
bunk
gasped
feebly
once
and
lay
still
i
do
like
that
sort
of
thing
said
jack
but
i
suppose
it
had
to
be
done
help
me
bind
him
up
and
gag
him
he
not
badly
hurt
and
will
come
round
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
the
work
of
but
a
few
moments
to
tear
the
sheets
into
strips
and
to
bind
and
gag
the
helpless
man
then
jack
and
frank
left
the
cabin
at
almost
the
same
instant
von
ludwig
and
harris
came
from
a
second
cabin
all
right
asked
von
ludwig
all
right
sir
and
you
everything
shipshape
now
for
the
crew
first
however
he
said
addressing
jack
and
frank
don
the
clothing
of
these
two
officers
you
shall
be
my
second
and
third
in
command
the
lads
returned
to
the
cabin
they
had
just
quitted
and
stripped
the
prisoner
jack
donned
the
uniform
for
the
german
was
a
big
man
then
they
hurried
into
the
second
cabin
and
performed
a
similar
operation
and
frank
soon
was
attired
in
the
uniform
of
a
german
lieutenant
now
said
von
ludwig
have
the
crew
report
here
and
keep
your
guns
ready
frank
made
his
way
aft
and
in
german
called
all
hands
forward
the
crew
came
tumbling
from
their
bunks
and
hurried
forward
most
of
the
men
no
more
than
half
dressed
jack
frank
and
harris
on
either
side
of
von
ludwig
confronted
them
men
said
von
ludwig
i
am
the
new
commander
of
this
ship
and
we
shall
get
under
way
immediately
fearing
that
you
will
not
always
obey
my
commands
i
have
brought
along
these
little
persuaders
a
pair
of
automatics
flashed
in
his
hands
and
covered
the
ten
sailors
hands
up
he
cried
taken
completely
by
surprise
there
was
nothing
for
the
german
sailors
to
do
but
obey
up
went
their
hands
von
ludwig
called
to
harris
help
me
keep
them
covered
he
said
while
you
other
two
tie
them
up
under
the
muzzles
of
the
revolvers
levelled
in
steady
hands
by
von
ludwig
and
harris
jack
and
frank
set
to
work
binding
the
members
of
the
crew
a
few
minutes
later
the
work
was
done
trundle
them
into
that
cabin
there
said
von
ludwig
motioning
to
an
open
door
tie
them
there
so
they
can
not
release
their
own
bonds
or
the
bonds
of
the
others
then
report
to
me
on
deck
the
lads
obeyed
it
was
the
work
of
only
a
few
moments
struggle
as
the
germans
did
then
frank
and
jack
went
on
deck
a
short
distance
away
a
rowboat
was
coming
rapidly
toward
the
for
such
was
the
name
of
the
vessel
on
which
the
lads
found
themselves
von
ludwig
pointed
to
it
my
crew
he
said
quietly
chapter
xxvi
discovered
a
few
moments
later
the
little
skiff
scraped
alongside
the
one
at
a
time
its
occupants
five
in
number
scrambled
over
the
side
and
stood
before
von
ludwig
the
latter
scrutinized
each
man
closely
all
right
he
said
at
length
he
selected
three
men
you
report
to
the
engine
room
immediately
he
said
you
will
find
everything
ready
the
crew
has
been
overpowered
and
there
will
be
no
one
to
interfere
with
you
the
men
moved
away
von
ludwig
addressed
the
other
two
take
the
lookout
forward
he
said
to
one
and
to
the
other
go
aft
and
keep
your
eyes
open
then
he
spoke
to
harris
i
appoint
you
in
command
in
the
engine
room
he
said
heed
your
signals
carefully
harris
saluted
very
well
sir
he
said
and
disappeared
von
ludwig
motioned
to
jack
and
frank
who
followed
him
to
the
bridge
the
officer
cast
a
quick
glance
over
the
water
and
said
i
guess
there
is
no
reason
to
delay
longer
chadwick
will
you
take
the
wheel
i
be
with
you
in
a
moment
to
give
you
your
directions
frank
moved
away
von
ludwig
was
just
about
to
address
jack
when
he
made
out
another
rowboat
coming
toward
the
hello
he
said
aloud
wonder
what
up
now
guess
we
better
wait
a
minute
the
rowboat
drew
closer
and
frank
discovered
it
was
filled
with
men
boat
crowded
with
men
sir
he
exclaimed
so
exclaimed
von
ludwig
then
i
guess
we
wo
wait
after
all
you
may
get
under
way
mr
templeton
with
this
order
von
ludwig
took
his
place
beside
frank
at
the
wheel
and
produced
a
chart
the
bell
in
the
engine
room
tinkled
a
moment
later
the
engines
began
to
move
and
the
slipped
easily
through
the
water
came
a
hail
from
the
rowboat
wait
a
moment
there
von
ludwig
paid
no
attention
to
this
call
the
gathered
headway
have
time
to
talk
to
you
fellows
said
von
ludwig
we
want
to
be
a
long
ways
from
here
before
daylight
there
was
a
sound
of
a
shot
from
the
rowboat
followed
by
many
other
shots
von
ludwig
waved
a
hand
in
derision
you
too
late
he
called
shoot
away
i
do
think
you
will
hit
anything
but
sir
said
frank
they
will
awaken
every
sleepy
german
hereabouts
that
so
said
von
ludwig
he
called
to
jack
full
speed
ahead
mr
templeton
jack
gave
the
word
and
the
vessel
dashed
ahead
i
do
know
anything
about
these
waters
sir
exclaimed
frank
in
some
alarm
there
may
be
mines
about
not
here
was
von
ludwig
reply
farther
on
yes
that
why
i
have
this
chart
we
run
the
mine
fields
safely
enough
barring
accidents
what
is
my
course
sir
asked
frank
due
north
until
i
tell
you
to
change
frank
said
nothing
further
but
guided
the
vessel
according
to
instructions
behind
the
rowboat
had
given
up
the
chase
but
now
from
other
parts
of
the
harbor
from
which
the
was
fast
speeding
came
sounds
of
confusion
searchlights
came
to
play
upon
the
von
ludwig
sighed
deeply
i
was
in
hopes
we
would
get
away
without
trouble
he
said
but
it
seems
we
wo
the
erstwhile
commander
of
this
vessel
must
have
discovered
in
some
manner
that
he
has
been
fooled
we
have
every
ship
of
war
hereabouts
after
us
sir
said
frank
that
what
we
will
was
von
ludwig
reply
however
i
am
not
afraid
of
their
catching
us
this
vessel
has
the
heels
of
anything
in
this
port
trouble
is
though
they
may
tip
off
vessels
on
the
outside
of
our
coming
by
wireless
what
shall
we
do
then
sir
we
have
to
manage
to
get
by
them
some
way
for
if
we
should
be
caught
now
it
would
mean
the
noose
for
all
of
us
not
a
very
cheerful
prospect
sir
said
frank
quietly
i
agree
with
you
however
they
have
caught
us
yet
we
give
them
a
hard
race
is
the
vessel
armed
sir
it
should
be
if
i
have
been
informed
correctly
i
have
a
look
about
hold
to
your
course
until
i
return
he
moved
away
he
was
back
in
a
few
moments
however
with
the
announcement
that
there
were
four
aft
as
well
as
four
forward
enough
to
fight
with
he
announced
gravely
but
we
have
the
men
to
man
them
sir
protested
frank
we
impress
our
prisoners
into
service
if
it
necessary
with
a
man
to
guard
them
they
can
handle
the
engine
room
i
am
afraid
it
will
come
to
that
sir
said
frank
von
ludwig
shrugged
what
will
be
will
be
he
replied
quietly
and
it
did
come
to
that
as
frank
had
predicted
as
the
vessel
still
flew
through
the
water
at
full
speed
there
came
a
sudden
cry
from
the
lookout
forward
cruiser
off
our
port
bow
sir
von
ludwig
sprang
forward
he
gazed
at
the
vessel
quickly
and
then
called
to
frank
port
your
helm
hard
frank
obeyed
without
question
and
the
swung
about
sharply
von
ludwig
sprang
to
his
side
they
pick
us
up
with
their
searchlight
in
a
minute
or
two
he
cried
come
with
me
templeton
chadwick
hold
that
course
till
i
come
back
jack
sprang
after
von
ludwig
the
latter
hurried
to
the
cabin
where
the
german
prisoners
were
confined
he
unloosened
the
bonds
of
five
you
men
he
said
sharply
will
go
before
us
to
the
engine
room
where
you
will
perform
the
necessary
duties
under
the
muzzles
of
the
weapons
of
jack
and
von
ludwig
the
men
obeyed
for
there
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
in
the
engine
room
von
ludwig
explained
i
want
you
men
to
put
forth
your
best
efforts
any
foolishness
and
you
will
be
shot
for
i
will
take
no
chances
harris
can
you
guard
them
yes
sir
replied
harris
with
a
smile
give
me
another
gun
sir
von
ludwig
passed
a
revolver
to
harris
there
must
be
no
half
way
methods
here
he
said
quietly
shoot
the
first
man
who
makes
a
false
move
ask
questions
afterward
our
lives
depend
upon
it
i
shall
obey
your
instructions
sir
good
von
ludwig
addressed
the
former
crew
follow
me
men
he
exclaimed
no
questions
were
asked
and
the
others
followed
jack
and
von
ludwig
from
the
room
leaving
harris
in
command
of
the
german
crew
of
five
these
germans
under
the
muzzles
of
harris
two
revolvers
fell
to
work
immediately
von
ludwig
led
the
former
crew
to
the
guns
forward
man
these
guns
he
said
quietly
there
may
be
fighting
to
do
when
i
give
the
word
fire
as
rapidly
and
as
accurately
as
possible
at
the
closest
enemy
vessel
very
well
sir
said
one
of
the
men
von
ludwig
called
to
jack
to
follow
him
and
returned
to
the
bridge
there
he
gave
a
slight
alteration
in
course
to
frank
and
the
head
turned
slightly
funny
they
have
raised
us
with
that
searchlight
von
ludwig
muttered
to
himself
the
was
dashing
through
the
water
at
a
rapid
gait
suddenly
she
became
the
center
of
a
blinding
glare
the
searchlight
of
a
german
cruiser
a
half
a
mile
to
port
had
picked
them
up
von
ludwig
gave
a
sharp
command
to
the
men
who
manned
the
forward
guns
aim
and
fire
he
cried
a
moment
later
one
of
the
guns
spoke
and
a
shell
screamed
across
the
water
toward
the
german
cruiser
apparently
it
did
not
find
its
mark
however
for
nothing
happened
aboard
the
enemy
to
indicate
the
shot
had
struck
home
again
cried
von
ludwig
another
gun
boomed
followed
a
sharp
explosion
good
work
men
cried
von
ludwig
try
it
again
but
the
next
shot
came
from
the
enemy
a
shell
screamed
overhead
they
do
better
with
the
next
shot
sir
said
jack
quietly
so
they
will
was
von
ludwig
quiet
response
starboard
your
helm
mr
chadwick
frank
obeyed
immediately
and
again
the
course
of
the
was
changed
quickly
and
none
too
soon
for
another
salvo
had
come
from
the
german
cruiser
and
two
shells
flew
past
the
spot
where
the
would
have
been
at
that
moment
had
her
course
not
suddenly
been
altered
fire
men
cried
von
ludwig
fire
as
fast
as
you
can
if
you
disable
her
we
are
done
for
the
men
who
manned
the
guns
were
working
like
trojans
once
twice
thrice
more
they
fired
and
upon
the
fourth
shot
there
came
a
cry
of
dismay
from
aboard
the
enemy
cruiser
must
have
hit
something
sir
said
frank
right
i
trust
it
was
a
vulnerable
spot
twice
more
the
german
cruiser
fired
at
the
but
without
result
the
smaller
vessel
was
drawing
ahead
rapidly
now
fifteen
minutes
and
we
will
be
safe
said
von
ludwig
the
men
aboard
the
continued
to
fire
at
the
german
cruiser
but
apparently
none
of
the
other
shots
found
their
mark
the
german
it
could
be
seen
was
in
full
pursuit
but
the
smaller
vessel
forged
rapidly
ahead
with
each
turn
of
her
screws
and
at
last
von
ludwig
exclaimed
thankfully
well
i
guess
we
are
safe
enough
here
but
even
as
he
spoke
a
cry
apprised
him
of
a
newer
and
closer
danger
chapter
xxvii
a
terrible
struggle
the
trouble
had
started
in
the
engine
room
hardly
had
the
drawn
clear
of
the
fire
of
the
german
cruiser
when
one
of
the
five
members
of
the
german
crew
impressed
into
service
fell
over
apparently
in
a
dead
faint
the
men
under
harris
watchful
eye
had
been
working
hard
and
the
first
thought
that
struck
the
englishman
was
that
the
man
had
dropped
from
exhaustion
hastily
he
shoved
one
of
his
automatics
in
his
belt
and
advancing
stooped
over
the
man
instantly
the
other
four
germans
rushed
for
him
harris
heard
them
coming
and
attempted
to
get
to
his
feet
he
was
too
late
a
heavy
shovel
wielded
by
one
of
his
four
assailants
struck
him
a
hard
blow
over
the
head
and
harris
fell
to
the
deck
unconscious
quickly
the
men
relieved
him
of
his
two
weapons
and
then
they
held
a
consultation
we
must
release
the
others
first
said
one
man
this
plan
was
agreed
upon
and
the
man
who
had
suggested
it
was
appointed
to
make
his
way
to
where
the
others
were
imprisoned
and
free
them
a
moment
later
he
slipped
stealthily
from
the
engine
room
and
as
stealthily
approached
the
cabin
where
his
fellow
countrymen
were
imprisoned
inside
he
closed
the
door
quickly
and
in
a
low
voice
cautioned
the
others
to
silence
quickly
he
unloosened
their
bonds
and
the
five
sailors
and
two
officers
rose
and
stretched
their
cramped
limbs
in
a
few
words
the
german
sailor
gave
his
officers
the
lay
of
the
land
and
the
first
lieutenant
took
command
in
the
next
cabin
he
said
is
a
chest
containing
revolvers
and
ammunition
bring
it
here
two
men
hurried
to
obey
and
returned
a
few
moments
later
bearing
the
chest
the
two
officers
armed
themselves
and
the
men
these
english
must
be
very
careless
said
one
else
we
would
never
have
this
chance
the
others
agreed
and
the
two
officers
considered
what
was
best
to
be
done
how
many
are
there
did
you
say
asked
the
first
officer
of
the
man
who
had
released
the
others
there
were
nine
but
we
have
disposed
of
the
man
in
the
engine
room
then
we
are
twelve
to
eight
good
first
we
will
try
and
capture
the
bridge
and
the
wheel
as
we
are
in
command
of
the
engine
room
the
rest
should
be
easy
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
capture
all
the
english
with
the
bridge
wheel
and
engine
room
in
our
possession
we
can
run
the
vessel
back
into
the
harbor
come
on
men
they
advanced
quietly
from
the
cabin
and
made
their
way
on
deck
it
was
the
appearance
of
the
first
head
that
had
called
forth
a
cry
from
one
of
the
british
that
had
attracted
von
ludwig
attention
wheeling
quickly
von
ludwig
saw
the
germans
dash
from
below
with
a
quick
cry
to
the
others
he
drew
his
revolver
and
fired
one
man
toppled
over
the
odds
against
the
british
were
one
less
but
the
others
sprang
forward
frank
at
the
wheel
was
forced
to
maintain
his
position
while
the
others
did
the
fighting
the
lookout
forward
and
the
man
stationed
aft
advanced
to
take
part
in
the
fray
though
keeping
out
of
sight
as
well
as
possible
turn
the
gun
on
them
men
cried
von
ludwig
the
three
men
who
manned
the
gun
sought
to
obey
but
the
gun
stuck
it
would
not
turn
most
likely
it
had
been
damaged
in
the
battle
with
the
german
cruiser
the
british
tried
the
other
guns
but
with
no
better
result
stay
where
you
are
shouted
van
ludwig
to
the
men
at
the
guns
keep
them
between
us
if
possible
the
gun
crew
who
had
been
on
the
point
of
trying
to
join
von
ludwig
and
jack
saw
the
strategy
of
this
plan
and
stooped
down
behind
the
guns
the
lookout
forward
also
stepped
behind
the
mainmast
where
he
began
to
blaze
away
at
the
foe
the
man
aft
by
a
dash
succeeded
in
reaching
the
side
of
von
ludwig
and
jack
frank
at
the
wheel
was
in
a
perilous
situation
but
there
he
had
determined
to
stay
until
ordered
to
shift
his
position
signal
the
engine
room
to
slow
down
said
von
ludwig
to
jack
jack
obeyed
and
the
ship
came
to
a
pause
apparently
the
men
below
believed
the
germans
had
recaptured
the
ship
if
harris
is
still
in
command
down
there
we
are
all
right
said
von
ludwig
if
not
there
will
be
more
of
the
enemy
up
here
in
a
minute
and
within
a
minute
more
of
the
enemy
appeared
back
here
chadwick
exclaimed
von
ludwig
never
mind
the
wheel
frank
sprang
to
the
shelter
of
the
bridge
jack
and
von
ludwig
protecting
his
retreat
frank
drew
his
revolver
a
german
poked
his
head
from
the
and
frank
took
a
snap
shot
the
head
disappeared
and
there
was
a
howl
of
pain
got
one
i
guess
said
the
lad
quietly
the
effect
of
this
shot
was
to
infuriate
the
germans
the
first
officer
commanded
a
charge
on
the
bridge
ten
men
dashed
forward
at
the
word
now
the
four
in
the
shelter
of
the
bridge
von
ludwig
frank
jack
and
the
man
who
had
come
from
the
after
part
of
the
vessel
stood
to
their
full
height
and
fired
into
the
crowd
from
the
rear
the
three
other
british
also
poured
in
a
volley
and
the
lookout
stepped
into
the
open
and
fired
caught
thus
between
three
fires
the
germans
were
at
a
loss
what
to
do
one
man
dropped
and
the
others
dashed
for
the
protection
of
the
companionway
before
reaching
there
however
the
first
german
officer
gave
the
command
to
scatter
and
several
of
the
germans
posted
themselves
behind
whatever
shelter
offered
on
deck
the
battle
had
reached
a
deadlock
the
british
could
not
expose
themselves
without
danger
of
being
struck
by
a
german
bullet
and
the
germans
confronted
the
same
situation
signal
the
engine
room
jack
instructed
von
ludwig
we
must
know
whether
harris
is
still
alive
there
was
no
response
to
the
signal
poor
fellow
said
von
ludwig
they
probably
have
done
for
him
from
time
to
time
jack
signalled
the
engine
room
thinking
perhaps
that
harris
had
only
been
wounded
and
that
he
might
answer
upon
the
fifth
signal
he
received
an
answer
then
jack
signalled
full
speed
ahead
a
moment
later
the
vessel
leaped
forward
there
came
a
cry
of
consternation
from
the
germans
who
tumbled
back
down
the
steps
as
they
did
so
frank
again
sprang
to
the
wheel
and
brought
the
head
of
the
sharply
about
for
since
he
had
released
his
hold
on
the
wheel
the
vessel
had
been
drifting
quickly
the
lad
lashed
the
wheel
with
several
lengths
of
cable
and
then
sprang
back
to
the
bridge
amid
a
volley
of
revolver
bullets
from
the
germans
who
still
held
the
deck
none
hit
him
below
in
the
engine
room
harris
was
facing
heavy
odds
before
answering
jack
signal
after
regaining
consciousness
he
had
closed
and
barred
the
door
and
now
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
hammering
upon
it
he
smiled
grimly
to
himself
you
wo
get
in
here
as
long
as
that
door
holds
he
said
before
that
i
should
have
assistance
the
pounding
upon
the
door
continued
we
have
to
lend
harris
a
hand
sir
said
jack
they
are
too
many
for
him
down
there
the
first
man
that
steps
clear
of
this
bridge
is
likely
to
get
shot
declared
von
ludwig
however
as
you
say
we
must
lend
him
a
hand
he
called
to
the
men
who
were
still
safe
behind
the
guns
make
a
rush
this
way
he
said
we
cover
your
retreat
a
moment
later
three
forms
flitted
across
the
deck
two
german
heads
were
raised
from
their
cover
frank
accounted
for
one
and
von
ludwig
for
the
other
thus
were
three
of
the
enemy
placed
de
seven
had
rushed
below
there
were
still
two
left
on
deck
a
spurt
of
flame
showed
jack
where
one
was
hidden
with
a
quick
move
the
lad
sprang
from
the
bridge
and
threw
himself
to
the
deck
on
his
face
there
was
another
spurt
of
flame
and
a
bullet
whistled
over
his
head
before
the
man
could
fire
again
jack
had
leaped
forward
and
seized
him
by
his
revolver
arm
angrily
the
lad
wrested
the
weapon
from
the
man
grasp
the
latter
drew
a
knife
there
was
but
one
thing
for
jack
to
do
quickly
he
raised
his
revolver
pointed
it
squarely
at
the
face
and
fired
a
flash
of
flame
had
betrayed
the
hiding
place
of
the
last
german
on
deck
two
of
the
british
rushed
for
him
the
german
accounted
for
both
of
them
before
they
could
reach
him
the
losses
so
far
had
been
two
british
and
four
of
the
enemy
there
were
still
six
british
on
deck
and
a
single
german
but
seven
teutons
were
still
hammering
at
the
door
of
the
engine
room
in
an
effort
to
get
at
harris
we
got
to
get
rid
of
this
fellow
on
deck
muttered
frank
he
spoke
to
one
of
the
men
near
him
you
advance
from
one
side
and
i
advance
from
the
other
said
the
lad
quietly
the
man
apparently
is
a
dead
shot
and
he
probably
will
get
one
of
us
but
he
dangerous
there
he
may
fire
at
you
and
he
may
fire
at
me
but
the
other
will
get
him
the
man
nodded
that
he
understood
and
one
from
each
side
of
the
bridge
they
advanced
as
it
transpired
it
was
not
frank
who
was
to
pay
the
penalty
for
this
rash
advance
perceiving
two
men
approaching
one
from
either
side
the
german
fired
quickly
frank
raised
his
revolver
and
also
fired
the
german
threw
up
his
arms
and
fell
to
the
deck
frank
turned
quickly
and
looked
for
the
man
who
had
left
the
shelter
of
the
bridge
with
him
he
lay
prone
on
the
deck
poor
fellow
said
frank
yet
it
had
to
be
done
just
luck
that
it
was
me
deck
clear
sir
said
frank
to
von
ludwig
now
to
lend
harris
a
hand
in
the
engine
room
forward
then
said
von
ludwig
all
except
you
frank
and
you
jack
you
two
stay
on
deck
take
the
wheel
again
frank
jack
you
stand
at
the
head
of
the
companionway
and
shoot
the
first
german
who
appears
there
very
well
sir
said
jack
although
he
was
disappointed
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
go
to
harris
aid
the
others
follow
me
said
von
ludwig
there
were
but
two
other
men
that
could
follow
you
are
attempting
too
much
sir
said
jack
i
think
not
said
von
ludwig
calmly
he
led
the
way
below
chapter
xxviii
the
cheating
of
harris
below
harris
had
just
armed
himself
with
a
great
iron
bar
for
he
knew
that
the
door
was
about
to
give
under
the
attacks
of
the
germans
the
fools
he
said
to
himself
why
do
they
blow
the
lock
off
it
seemed
that
the
same
thought
struck
the
german
first
officer
at
about
the
same
moment
motioning
his
men
back
he
approached
the
door
and
put
the
muzzle
of
his
revolver
against
the
lock
he
pulled
the
trigger
and
when
the
germans
again
surged
against
the
door
it
flew
open
beneath
their
weight
one
man
stumbled
headlong
through
the
door
as
he
did
so
harris
raised
his
heavy
bar
and
brought
it
down
on
the
man
head
the
german
dropped
with
a
crushed
skull
but
before
harris
could
raise
his
weapon
again
the
germans
had
closed
about
him
and
sought
to
strike
him
down
with
the
butts
of
their
revolvers
the
struggling
figures
were
so
closely
entwined
now
that
the
enemy
could
not
fire
without
fear
of
hitting
one
of
their
own
number
harris
struck
out
right
and
left
and
men
staggered
back
before
his
terrific
blows
then
came
the
sounds
of
running
footsteps
without
back
called
the
german
first
officer
two
british
heads
appeared
in
the
doorway
almost
simultaneously
crack
crack
crack
crack
the
germans
poured
a
volley
into
the
two
men
and
the
latter
sagged
to
the
deck
harris
at
the
same
moment
had
jumped
toward
the
door
as
he
leaped
over
the
prostrate
forms
he
collided
with
von
ludwig
quick
sir
he
cried
they
are
too
many
for
us
back
on
deck
there
was
something
in
harris
manner
that
impressed
von
ludwig
without
stopping
to
argue
he
followed
harris
when
both
were
safe
on
deck
harris
quickly
closed
the
door
of
the
companionway
and
battened
it
down
we
a
breathing
spell
at
any
rate
he
said
mopping
his
face
why
all
this
rush
demanded
von
ludwig
where
are
the
men
who
went
to
your
assistance
dead
the
same
as
we
would
be
if
we
had
lingered
another
moment
replied
harris
quietly
it
was
impossible
to
pass
through
that
door
without
being
shot
down
it
was
only
due
to
the
diversion
of
the
appearance
of
the
others
that
permitted
me
to
escape
came
heavy
blows
against
the
covering
of
the
companionway
they
want
to
come
out
said
harris
grinning
that
door
wo
stand
much
battering
said
von
ludwig
no
it
wo
was
harris
reply
but
one
man
can
guard
it
well
enough
besides
we
have
the
bridge
we
can
steer
the
vessel
where
we
will
as
long
as
the
engines
run
we
can
agreed
von
ludwig
but
unless
greatly
mistaken
the
germans
will
soon
stop
them
he
was
right
for
a
few
moments
later
the
battering
at
the
door
of
the
companionway
ceased
and
the
engines
ceased
work
well
we
ca
go
any
place
now
sir
said
frank
leaving
the
wheel
and
approaching
von
ludwig
and
harris
at
the
companionway
jack
also
came
up
to
them
you
right
agreed
von
ludwig
and
that
not
the
worst
of
it
the
german
cruiser
probably
is
in
pursuit
of
us
if
they
sight
us
we
are
done
for
came
more
violent
blows
on
the
door
over
the
companionway
followed
by
a
shot
from
below
jack
sprang
aside
as
a
bullet
plowed
its
way
through
the
hard
wood
we
have
to
stand
to
one
side
he
said
otherwise
they
are
likely
to
drop
one
of
us
the
door
will
stand
considerable
battering
said
von
ludwig
there
is
but
one
thing
i
can
think
of
we
shall
have
to
desert
the
ship
in
what
a
rowboat
asked
frank
with
some
sarcasm
hardly
returned
von
ludwig
but
i
have
discovered
that
there
is
a
motor
boat
aboard
we
can
launch
that
and
move
off
and
as
soon
as
the
germans
break
out
here
they
come
after
us
and
shoot
us
full
of
holes
said
harris
well
that
true
enough
too
agreed
von
ludwig
of
course
if
we
had
an
hour
start
we
might
get
through
but
the
door
wo
hold
that
long
harris
had
been
turning
a
plan
over
in
his
mind
if
you
please
sir
he
said
slowly
at
last
i
have
a
plan
that
may
work
let
hear
it
said
frank
yes
let
have
it
said
von
ludwig
well
said
harris
one
man
with
a
couple
of
revolvers
should
be
able
to
guard
this
passageway
for
an
hour
without
trouble
he
can
shoot
the
germans
down
as
fast
as
they
come
up
my
plan
is
this
let
one
man
stay
behind
on
guard
the
others
can
put
off
in
the
motor
boat
but
the
one
man
will
die
said
frank
of
course
said
harris
simply
that
shall
be
my
job
not
much
said
jack
i
pick
that
job
for
myself
not
while
i
here
you
wo
declared
frank
i
plenty
big
to
guard
the
companionway
the
plan
you
suggest
harris
von
ludwig
said
quietly
is
the
only
one
so
far
as
i
can
see
that
promises
any
degree
of
success
in
my
pocket
are
papers
that
must
reach
the
british
admiralty
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
then
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
think
of
staying
sir
said
harris
wait
said
von
ludwig
in
a
venture
such
as
this
there
is
no
reason
one
man
should
be
called
upon
to
sacrifice
himself
more
than
another
we
shall
all
have
an
even
chance
what
do
you
mean
sir
asked
frank
simply
this
we
shall
draw
lots
to
see
who
shall
remain
suits
me
said
harris
with
a
shrug
and
me
declared
jack
well
then
i
agreeable
frank
said
quietly
good
harris
in
the
pocket
of
my
coat
which
hangs
in
the
pilot
house
you
will
find
a
pack
of
cards
bring
them
here
harris
walked
away
and
returned
a
few
seconds
later
with
a
pack
of
playing
cards
von
ludwig
opened
the
box
and
produced
the
cards
the
man
who
cuts
the
lowest
card
shall
stay
behind
he
said
quietly
shuffle
he
passed
the
cards
to
harris
who
riffled
them
lightly
one
moment
said
von
ludwig
if
i
should
be
the
man
to
stay
i
want
one
of
you
to
take
these
papers
in
my
pocket
they
must
be
turned
over
to
the
admiralty
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
should
the
man
who
carries
them
be
in
danger
of
capture
they
must
be
destroyed
do
you
understand
yes
sir
said
jack
frank
nodded
it
shall
be
as
you
say
sir
said
harris
now
who
will
cut
first
it
may
as
well
be
me
as
another
said
von
ludwig
he
cut
the
cards
and
exposed
to
view
a
jack
of
hearts
looks
like
you
will
carry
the
papers
yourself
sir
said
frank
as
he
advanced
to
cut
the
cards
he
held
up
a
nine
spot
of
spades
that
lets
you
out
sir
he
said
to
von
ludwig
the
latter
was
plainly
nervous
jack
cut
the
cards
next
frank
uttered
a
cry
of
consternation
the
three
of
clubs
looks
like
i
was
the
fellow
to
stay
all
right
said
jack
smiling
slightly
and
this
time
said
frank
you
may
not
be
as
fortunate
as
upon
the
day
you
remained
behind
and
faced
death
on
the
submarine
jack
shrugged
ca
be
helped
he
said
quietly
now
harris
advanced
and
cut
the
cards
quickly
as
he
picked
up
the
upper
half
of
the
deck
he
turned
his
shoulder
slightly
so
that
the
others
for
the
moment
might
not
see
what
he
had
cut
he
glanced
at
the
bottom
card
it
was
the
six
of
diamonds
deftly
harris
shuffled
the
cards
with
his
hands
adept
in
the
art
of
trickery
though
the
others
did
not
know
it
he
had
placed
the
cards
in
such
position
that
he
knew
almost
identically
where
the
high
and
low
cards
were
like
a
flash
his
hand
passed
across
the
bottom
of
the
deck
and
when
it
was
withdrawn
the
six
of
diamonds
had
disappeared
then
he
turned
to
the
others
and
exposed
the
two
spot
of
spades
i
lose
he
said
quietly
harris
movements
had
been
so
quick
that
they
had
not
been
perceived
by
the
others
jack
was
the
first
to
extend
a
hand
i
sorry
the
lad
said
quietly
i
was
in
hopes
that
it
would
be
me
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
others
harris
kept
his
left
hand
behind
him
for
in
it
reposed
the
card
he
had
palmed
the
six
of
diamonds
which
would
have
allowed
him
to
go
with
the
others
and
would
have
put
jack
in
his
place
as
he
turned
harris
slipped
the
card
quickly
into
his
pocket
that
it
might
not
be
accidentally
seen
then
he
knew
he
was
safe
jack
picked
up
the
deck
i
shall
keep
these
harris
he
said
that
i
may
always
remember
a
brave
man
all
this
time
the
thundering
on
the
door
of
the
companionway
had
continued
come
said
von
ludwig
we
must
delay
no
longer
already
it
is
growing
light
he
hastened
along
the
deck
to
where
the
motor
boat
lay
covered
with
a
tarpaulin
quickly
the
little
craft
was
lowered
over
the
side
von
ludwig
first
inspecting
it
plenty
of
water
and
provisions
he
said
quietly
he
turned
to
harris
it
is
time
to
say
goodbye
he
said
quietly
you
are
a
brave
man
this
gallant
action
shall
be
known
to
the
world
goodbye
sir
said
harris
quietly
remember
said
von
ludwig
there
is
always
a
chance
that
you
may
escape
if
it
comes
make
the
most
of
it
goodbye
he
pressed
harris
hand
and
passed
over
the
side
of
the
vessel
as
frank
and
jack
shook
hands
with
harris
the
latter
squeezed
hand
affectionately
the
latter
smiled
i
had
promised
myself
another
bout
with
you
some
day
he
said
my
only
regret
is
that
it
is
not
possible
now
a
moment
more
jack
was
in
the
motor
boat
and
it
moved
away
harris
drew
his
revolvers
and
mounted
guard
over
the
companionway
the
door
of
which
now
had
begun
to
splinter
an
hour
is
what
you
needed
he
said
quietly
you
get
it
chapter
xxix
a
champion
passes
harris
laid
one
of
his
revolvers
on
the
deck
reached
in
his
pocket
and
produced
the
six
of
diamonds
he
looked
at
it
closely
in
the
half
darkness
and
a
smile
passed
over
his
face
i
suppose
i
a
fool
he
muttered
to
himself
but
someway
i
help
it
i
was
afraid
jack
would
cut
the
low
card
i
would
have
done
it
for
one
of
the
others
but
jack
well
he
a
boy
after
my
own
heart
harris
replaced
the
card
in
his
pocket
then
thought
better
of
his
action
drew
it
forth
again
and
sent
it
spinning
off
across
the
sea
there
he
said
quietly
goes
all
evidence
that
i
cheated
he
picked
up
the
revolver
he
had
laid
on
the
deck
and
moved
a
short
distance
from
the
companionway
there
was
an
extra
violent
crash
and
it
seemed
that
the
door
must
burst
open
another
one
like
that
will
do
the
work
said
harris
calmly
he
took
up
what
he
considered
a
strategic
position
and
produced
his
watch
this
he
lay
on
the
deck
and
sat
down
beside
it
may
as
well
be
comfortable
he
remarked
again
there
was
a
crash
and
the
door
of
the
companionway
burst
open
a
german
head
appeared
crack
harris
had
fired
without
moving
from
his
sitting
posture
the
german
head
disappeared
and
there
was
a
cry
of
alarm
from
below
one
down
i
guess
said
harris
quietly
to
himself
for
some
moments
there
was
silence
broken
occasionally
however
by
the
dull
sound
of
voices
from
below
talking
it
over
eh
muttered
harris
well
i
still
be
here
when
you
try
again
it
was
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
later
that
a
cap
appeared
in
the
opening
again
harris
fired
the
cap
did
not
disappear
and
harris
fired
twice
more
quickly
the
cap
disappeared
guess
i
got
another
one
said
harris
twice
more
within
the
next
fifteen
minutes
this
happened
that
should
be
four
if
i
have
counted
correctly
said
harris
and
i
still
four
cartridges
left
i
wo
have
to
reload
yet
he
felt
in
his
pocket
and
then
uttered
an
exclamation
of
alarm
no
more
bullets
i
have
to
make
these
four
count
for
the
next
two
nothing
appeared
in
the
doorway
again
for
ten
minutes
more
and
then
harris
fired
again
fifteen
minutes
later
the
same
thing
happened
and
harris
making
sure
that
this
was
the
last
of
the
enemy
emptied
his
revolver
at
it
then
he
got
to
his
feet
and
put
his
watch
in
his
pocket
guess
that
settles
it
he
said
now
i
look
around
for
a
boat
i
did
know
it
was
going
to
be
as
easy
as
all
that
if
i
had
i
would
have
had
the
others
wait
for
me
he
moved
toward
the
companionway
and
as
he
did
so
a
bullet
whistled
by
his
ear
harris
stepped
back
in
surprise
and
in
that
moment
the
solution
came
to
him
by
jove
they
fooled
me
he
muttered
they
poked
their
caps
up
and
i
shot
them
full
of
holes
however
they
do
know
yet
that
out
of
bullets
a
few
moments
later
a
cap
again
appeared
in
the
opening
harris
had
no
bullets
to
fire
at
it
they
discover
my
predicament
in
a
moment
or
so
though
he
told
himself
he
pulled
his
watch
from
his
pocket
and
glanced
at
it
an
hour
he
said
they
have
had
time
enough
however
i
just
see
the
thing
through
as
he
spoke
it
grew
light
harris
looked
off
across
the
sea
there
so
far
away
that
it
appeared
but
a
speck
upon
the
water
he
saw
what
he
took
to
be
the
motor
boat
bearing
his
friends
to
safety
he
waved
his
cap
good
luck
he
said
quietly
now
a
german
head
appeared
in
the
door
of
the
companionway
it
was
not
a
cap
this
time
harris
saw
it
and
drawing
back
his
arm
hurled
one
of
his
revolvers
swiftly
his
aim
was
true
and
the
weapon
struck
the
german
squarely
in
the
face
with
a
scream
of
pain
the
man
fell
back
into
the
arms
of
his
companions
but
harris
action
had
told
his
enemies
that
he
had
no
more
bullets
and
seeing
that
they
had
but
one
man
to
contend
with
the
germans
sprang
from
their
shelter
and
leaped
for
him
harris
clubbed
his
remaining
revolver
and
with
his
back
to
the
pilot
house
where
he
had
retreated
awaited
the
approach
of
the
four
foes
you
going
to
have
the
fight
of
your
lives
he
said
grimly
a
german
sprang
harris
arm
rose
and
fell
and
there
was
one
german
less
to
contend
with
but
before
harris
could
raise
his
arm
again
the
other
three
had
closed
in
upon
him
harris
felt
himself
borne
back
the
former
pugilistic
champion
of
the
british
navy
cast
all
ring
ethics
to
the
winds
he
struck
kicked
and
clawed
and
sought
to
wreak
what
damage
he
could
upon
his
enemies
without
regard
for
the
niceties
of
fighting
he
knew
that
they
would
do
the
same
to
him
so
great
had
been
the
force
of
the
shock
of
the
three
germans
all
that
were
now
left
of
the
original
twelve
that
harris
was
borne
to
the
deck
his
revolver
hand
struck
the
floor
with
great
force
and
the
weapon
was
sent
spinning
from
his
grasp
with
a
mighty
effort
he
hurled
the
three
men
from
him
and
leaped
to
his
feet
the
germans
also
arose
harris
did
not
wait
for
them
to
resume
the
offensive
with
head
lowered
he
charged
nimbly
the
foe
skipped
to
either
side
and
harris
felt
a
keen
pain
in
his
right
side
one
of
the
foe
had
drawn
a
knife
and
stabbed
as
harris
rushed
by
whirling
quickly
harris
again
sprang
forward
one
man
did
not
leap
out
of
his
way
quickly
enough
and
harris
hands
found
his
throat
the
man
gave
a
screech
as
harris
hands
squeezed
the
englishman
raised
his
enemy
bodily
from
the
deck
flung
him
squarely
in
the
faces
of
the
other
two
and
followed
after
the
human
catapult
the
foremost
german
dodged
and
seized
harris
by
the
legs
both
went
over
in
a
heap
harris
on
top
harris
raised
his
right
fist
and
would
have
brought
it
down
on
the
german
face
but
for
the
fact
that
the
second
foe
seized
his
arm
in
a
fierce
grasp
at
the
same
moment
he
struck
with
his
knife
the
point
penetrated
harris
right
side
and
he
felt
himself
growing
faint
angrily
he
shook
the
german
from
him
and
rose
to
his
feet
the
man
who
had
been
underneath
the
englishman
also
got
quickly
to
his
feet
and
before
harris
could
turn
stabbed
him
in
the
back
with
a
cry
harris
whirled
on
him
and
seized
the
knife
arm
he
twisted
sharply
the
german
cried
out
in
pain
and
sought
to
free
himself
but
his
effort
was
in
vain
with
the
grasp
by
the
wrist
harris
swung
the
man
in
the
air
and
spinning
on
his
heel
hurled
him
far
across
the
deck
where
the
unconscious
form
struck
with
a
crash
and
at
the
same
moment
the
other
german
struck
again
with
his
knife
harris
staggered
back
now
the
german
who
so
recently
had
felt
the
effect
of
harris
fingers
in
his
throat
pulled
himself
from
the
deck
and
renewed
the
battle
he
advanced
crouching
and
another
knife
gleamed
in
his
hand
it
is
possible
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
effects
of
the
knife
wounds
harris
in
the
end
would
have
overcome
these
foes
for
he
was
a
powerful
man
but
when
a
man
is
bleeding
from
half
a
dozen
wounds
and
faces
two
adversaries
both
armed
with
knives
he
has
little
chance
of
ultimate
victory
harris
realized
it
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
beg
for
mercy
besides
so
fierce
had
been
his
attacks
and
so
great
his
execution
it
is
not
probable
that
the
germans
would
have
spared
him
anyhow
they
were
insane
with
rage
there
were
only
two
of
them
left
now
and
harris
told
himself
that
their
number
would
be
fewer
by
one
before
they
finished
with
him
he
leaned
against
the
pilot
house
panting
from
his
exertions
a
great
lot
of
fighters
you
are
he
taunted
his
enemies
four
of
you
attacked
me
with
knives
and
you
have
done
for
me
yet
the
germans
also
were
glad
of
a
breathing
spell
their
faces
reddened
as
harris
taunted
them
we
shall
kill
you
yet
said
one
angrily
do
be
too
sure
said
harris
i
an
englishman
you
know
and
you
have
always
been
afraid
of
an
englishman
at
this
the
germans
uttered
a
cry
of
rage
and
sprang
forward
their
knives
flashing
aloft
the
first
german
missed
his
mark
as
harris
dodged
beneath
his
arm
and
closed
with
him
he
uttered
a
cry
for
help
that
right
you
coward
you
need
it
said
harris
he
squeezed
the
man
with
all
his
might
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
he
caught
the
glint
of
the
other
german
knife
as
it
descended
releasing
his
hold
upon
the
one
man
he
stepped
quickly
backward
but
the
knife
caught
him
a
glancing
blow
on
the
forehead
inflicting
a
deep
wound
for
a
moment
harris
paused
to
shake
the
blood
out
of
his
eyes
then
with
a
smile
playing
across
his
features
he
advanced
and
as
he
advanced
he
said
you
done
for
me
the
lot
of
you
but
i
shall
take
you
with
me
the
germans
quailed
at
the
look
in
his
face
and
as
he
moved
forward
swiftly
they
threw
down
their
knives
and
turned
to
run
but
they
had
delayed
too
long
harris
stretched
both
hands
out
straight
before
him
one
hand
closed
about
the
arm
of
the
german
to
his
right
the
other
clutched
the
second
man
by
the
throat
harris
pulled
the
man
he
held
by
the
arm
close
then
released
his
grip
but
before
the
german
could
stagger
away
seized
him
too
by
the
throat
now
i
got
you
he
said
blow
after
blow
the
germans
rained
upon
his
face
and
shoulders
kicking
out
with
their
feet
the
while
harris
paid
no
more
attention
to
these
than
he
would
have
to
the
taps
of
a
child
but
the
englishman
felt
his
strength
waning
fast
it
was
with
an
effort
that
he
staggered
across
the
deck
at
the
rail
he
paused
for
a
moment
gathering
his
strength
for
a
final
effort
then
still
holding
a
german
by
the
throat
with
each
hand
he
leaped
into
the
sea
once
twice
three
times
the
three
heads
appeared
on
the
surface
and
a
spectator
could
have
seen
that
harris
retained
his
grip
then
the
three
sank
from
sight
and
so
passed
the
former
pugilistic
champion
of
the
british
fleet
brave
in
death
as
he
had
been
in
life
the
waves
washed
over
the
spot
where
he
had
gone
down
chapter
xxx
the
unknown
unmasks
with
the
coming
of
dawn
the
three
figures
in
the
little
motor
boat
gazed
back
in
the
direction
from
whence
they
had
come
there
they
could
still
make
out
the
distant
shape
of
the
she
rode
quietly
in
the
water
and
there
was
nothing
about
her
appearance
to
tell
the
three
in
the
motor
boat
of
the
terrible
struggle
that
was
raging
even
at
that
moment
poor
harris
said
jack
i
hope
that
in
some
manner
he
is
able
to
escape
certainly
i
hope
so
too
declared
frank
he
a
brave
man
said
von
ludwig
jack
drew
the
fateful
deck
of
cards
from
his
pocket
these
he
said
i
shall
keep
he
ran
through
the
deck
several
times
playing
with
them
unconsciously
he
counted
them
there
was
something
wrong
jack
counted
the
cards
again
the
result
was
the
same
sir
he
called
to
von
ludwig
well
how
did
you
chance
to
have
this
pack
of
cards
i
play
solitaire
considerably
was
the
reply
you
could
have
played
solitaire
with
this
deck
said
jack
why
not
all
the
cards
are
not
here
there
are
but
there
were
when
i
put
them
in
my
pocket
said
von
ludwig
because
i
counted
them
again
jack
ran
through
the
deck
there
were
but
cards
suddenly
the
lad
gave
a
start
he
spread
the
cards
out
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
making
four
piles
all
suits
together
he
counted
the
hearts
they
were
all
there
thirteen
of
them
he
counted
the
clubs
they
were
all
there
too
next
he
counted
the
spades
all
were
there
last
he
counted
the
diamonds
there
were
but
twelve
jack
arranged
them
in
order
there
was
one
card
shy
jack
found
what
it
was
a
moment
later
there
was
no
six
of
diamonds
in
the
deck
for
some
moments
jack
sat
silent
staring
at
the
cards
before
him
he
had
been
struck
with
a
great
light
so
he
said
to
himself
at
last
harris
cheated
what
that
said
frank
who
had
heard
jack
muttered
words
but
had
not
caught
their
import
i
said
replied
jack
slowly
that
harris
cheated
frank
was
surprised
a
moment
later
he
said
well
even
if
he
did
he
lost
anyhow
that
it
said
jack
quietly
he
did
lose
you
mean
exclaimed
frank
excitedly
yes
i
mean
that
i
lost
i
should
have
been
the
one
to
stay
impossible
said
frank
it
true
declared
jack
von
ludwig
here
says
the
deck
was
a
full
deck
it
shy
a
card
now
the
six
of
diamonds
is
missing
that
is
the
card
harris
cut
first
you
remember
he
turned
aside
yes
but
that
when
he
slipped
the
six
of
diamonds
out
of
sight
and
exposed
the
deuce
of
spades
what
all
this
talk
about
cards
asked
von
ludwig
at
this
juncture
jack
explained
and
for
a
few
moments
von
ludwig
was
lost
in
thought
you
know
he
said
finally
i
think
more
of
that
fellow
every
minute
that
the
one
case
i
have
ever
heard
of
where
a
man
cheated
with
honor
there
was
silence
aboard
the
little
craft
as
it
sped
over
the
water
all
three
aboard
keeping
a
close
watch
for
the
approach
of
a
german
vessel
of
some
sort
von
ludwig
referred
to
his
chart
occasionally
for
he
wished
to
steer
as
clear
of
mines
as
possible
they
might
be
deep
in
the
water
and
they
might
be
close
to
the
surface
there
was
no
use
taking
chances
and
while
the
voyage
continued
the
lads
were
to
be
treated
to
yet
another
surprise
but
this
surprise
was
to
be
a
pleasure
and
would
not
bring
heavy
hearts
as
had
the
discovery
of
the
missing
card
i
wish
said
jack
suddenly
to
von
ludwig
that
you
would
tell
me
who
you
really
are
i
sit
here
and
look
at
you
and
know
i
should
be
able
to
call
your
name
but
i
ca
do
it
and
it
makes
it
decidedly
unpleasant
von
ludwig
smiled
i
should
have
thought
you
would
know
me
in
a
minute
in
spite
of
my
disguise
he
said
quietly
i
am
sure
i
should
have
known
both
of
you
no
matter
what
pains
you
took
to
conceal
your
features
you
only
making
matters
worse
said
frank
come
on
now
and
tell
us
who
you
are
again
von
ludwig
smiled
i
wonder
if
you
can
guess
who
i
am
when
i
say
that
i
can
tell
you
all
about
yourselves
he
said
for
instance
you
jack
you
spent
most
of
your
life
in
a
little
african
village
and
you
frank
are
an
american
who
was
shanghaied
aboard
a
sailing
vessel
in
naples
soon
after
the
outbreak
of
the
war
by
jove
said
jack
outside
of
frank
here
there
is
only
one
man
who
knows
all
that
about
me
and
there
is
but
a
single
man
who
knows
as
much
of
me
declared
frank
can
it
be
for
answer
von
ludwig
rose
in
his
seat
and
stripped
from
his
face
the
heavy
german
beard
that
had
given
him
the
true
teutonic
expression
and
there
stood
revealed
before
jack
and
frank
none
other
than
lord
hastings
their
erstwhile
commander
and
good
friend
frank
gave
a
cry
of
delight
and
sprang
forward
at
the
imminent
risk
of
upsetting
the
motor
boat
he
seized
lord
hastings
hand
and
pressed
it
warmly
the
latter
greeting
was
no
less
affectionate
jack
not
so
given
to
demonstrations
as
his
chum
also
advanced
and
grasped
lord
hand
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
again
sir
the
lad
said
quietly
it
seems
like
an
age
since
we
saw
you
and
to
think
that
we
did
recognize
you
instantly
that
what
seemed
so
funny
to
me
said
lord
hastings
when
i
first
saw
you
aboard
that
german
vessel
i
was
fearful
for
a
minute
that
you
would
recognize
me
and
blurt
it
out
right
there
but
what
were
you
doing
there
lord
hastings
asked
frank
it
a
long
story
was
the
latter
reply
but
i
guess
now
is
as
good
a
time
as
any
to
explain
i
wish
you
would
sir
said
jack
well
said
lord
hastings
as
you
know
i
told
you
when
we
parted
that
i
had
an
important
diplomatic
duty
to
perform
first
it
carried
me
to
roumania
where
i
may
say
i
was
successful
you
mean
that
roumania
has
decided
to
cast
in
her
fortunes
with
the
allies
sir
exactly
she
will
take
that
step
some
time
in
august
though
the
exact
date
i
am
unable
to
say
my
mission
there
at
an
end
i
was
ordered
to
report
to
berlin
as
you
know
we
still
maintain
a
staff
of
correspondents
in
the
german
capital
although
their
identities
are
closely
hidden
frank
and
jack
nodded
for
they
had
known
this
some
time
before
well
lord
hastings
continued
in
berlin
i
was
instructed
to
learn
what
germany
planned
to
do
to
offset
the
roumanian
menace
for
she
is
sure
to
know
of
roumanians
decision
by
this
time
i
had
some
trouble
but
i
succeeded
at
last
and
what
will
she
do
sir
asked
frank
that
was
the
reply
i
am
unable
to
state
at
this
minute
it
is
a
secret
that
i
am
guarding
carefully
and
i
can
not
even
tell
you
lads
about
it
frank
and
jack
asked
no
further
questions
along
that
line
but
how
came
you
aboard
the
german
vessel
sir
jack
wanted
to
know
lord
hastings
smiled
in
berlin
he
said
i
was
supposed
to
be
a
roumanian
officer
who
had
hopes
of
changing
the
attitude
of
that
country
the
kaiser
wished
to
show
me
how
foolish
it
would
be
for
the
little
balkan
state
to
join
the
allies
and
for
that
reason
had
me
shown
through
the
german
naval
fortifications
that
information
too
i
am
carrying
back
with
me
but
why
did
you
tell
us
who
you
were
in
bremen
sir
i
do
know
at
first
i
guess
because
i
wanted
to
surprise
you
both
when
you
did
learn
who
i
was
but
you
told
us
not
to
try
and
learn
who
you
were
well
that
was
for
a
good
reason
for
if
you
should
have
sought
to
pry
it
might
have
aroused
suspicions
and
there
is
no
telling
what
would
have
happened
i
see
sir
said
frank
but
you
almost
lost
us
when
you
did
get
back
in
time
i
know
that
now
i
would
do
the
same
thing
again
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
after
you
return
to
london
sir
frank
wanted
to
know
again
lord
hastings
smiled
that
hard
to
tell
he
replied
still
i
imagine
it
will
not
be
very
long
before
i
feel
a
deck
under
my
heels
again
you
mean
you
will
leave
the
diplomatic
service
again
sir
asked
jack
i
expect
to
the
king
promised
me
a
new
command
before
he
despatched
me
to
the
balkans
but
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
shall
be
kept
waiting
and
when
you
get
it
sir
will
we
go
back
with
you
asked
frank
why
was
the
reply
i
should
have
thought
that
by
this
time
you
would
perhaps
have
changed
your
minds
never
sir
declared
jack
positively
we
would
rather
serve
under
you
sir
i
see
what
can
be
done
lord
hastings
promised
and
with
that
the
lads
were
forced
to
be
content
still
they
knew
well
enough
that
lord
hastings
would
do
what
he
could
to
have
them
with
him
again
the
main
thing
now
said
lord
hastings
is
to
dodge
the
enemy
and
get
back
to
england
with
you
here
sir
said
frank
i
am
sure
we
shall
get
back
safely
and
frank
proved
a
good
prophet
all
that
day
they
made
their
way
slowly
through
the
north
sea
several
times
enemy
ships
were
sighted
but
because
the
little
motor
boat
lay
so
low
in
the
water
the
germans
did
not
see
them
with
the
coming
of
night
however
lord
hastings
increased
the
speed
of
the
little
craft
he
felt
that
they
were
now
beyond
the
german
mine
fields
and
that
if
another
vessel
were
encountered
it
probably
would
be
british
and
this
proved
to
be
the
case
along
toward
morning
of
the
second
day
a
british
cruiser
bore
down
on
them
soon
all
were
aboard
the
vessel
which
when
lord
hastings
informed
the
commander
of
the
nature
of
the
papers
he
carried
turned
about
and
headed
for
london
a
day
or
two
later
frank
and
jack
again
found
themselves
installed
in
the
comfortable
home
of
lord
hastings
where
they
sat
down
to
await
what
time
might
bring
forth
confident
however
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
they
were
upon
active
service
under
the
command
of
their
good
friend
lord
hastings
