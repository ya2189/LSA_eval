carlyle
aged
the
ninth
in
descent
from
captain
geoffry
carlyle
of
glasgow
scotland
was
among
the
heroic
canadian
dead
at
vimy
ridge
unmarried
and
the
last
of
his
line
what
few
treasures
he
possessed
fell
into
alien
hands
among
these
was
a
manuscript
apparently
written
in
the
year
and
which
through
nine
generations
had
been
carefully
preserved
yet
never
made
public
the
paper
was
yellowed
and
discolored
by
years
occasionally
a
page
was
missing
and
the
writing
itself
had
become
almost
indecipherable
much
indeed
had
to
be
traced
by
use
of
a
microscope
the
writer
was
evidently
a
man
of
some
education
and
clear
thought
but
exceedingly
diffuse
in
accordance
with
the
style
of
his
time
and
possessing
small
conception
of
literary
form
in
editing
this
manuscript
for
modern
readers
i
have
therefore
been
compelled
to
practically
rewrite
it
entirely
retaining
merely
the
essential
facts
with
an
occasional
descriptive
passage
although
i
have
conscientiously
followed
the
original
development
of
the
tale
in
this
reconstruction
much
quaintness
of
language
as
well
as
appeal
to
probability
may
have
been
lost
and
for
this
my
only
excuse
is
the
necessity
of
thus
making
the
story
readable
i
have
no
doubt
as
to
its
essential
truth
nor
do
i
question
the
purpose
which
dominated
this
rover
of
the
sea
in
his
effort
to
record
the
adventures
of
his
younger
life
as
a
picture
of
those
days
of
blood
and
courage
as
well
as
a
story
of
love
and
devotion
i
deem
it
worthy
preservation
regretting
only
the
impossibility
of
now
presenting
it

of
unusual

and

until
long
after
i
have
departed
from
this
world
when
it
will
be
difficult
to
convince
readers
that
such
times
as
are
herein
depicted
could
ever
have
been
reality
i
shall
endeavor
to
narrate
each
incident
in
the
simplest
manner
possible
my
only
purpose
is
truth
and
my
only
witness
history
yet
even
now
lately
as
this
all
happened
it
is
more
like
the
recollections
of
a
dream
dimly
remembered
at
awakening
and
perchance
might
remain
so
but
for
the
scars
upon
my
body
and
the
constant
memory
of
a
woman
face
these
alone
combine
to
bring
back
in
vividness
those
days
that
were
days
of
youth
and
daring
of
desperate
lawless
war
of
wide
ocean
peril
and
the
outstretched
hands
of
love
so
that
here
where
i
am
writing
it
all
down
here
amid
quietness
and
peace
and
forgetful
of
the
past
i
wander
again
along
a
deserted
shore
and
sail
among
those
isles
of
a
southern
sea
the
home
for
many
a
century
of
crime
and
unspeakable
cruelty
i
will
recall
the
truth
and
can
do
no
more
i
can
recall
that
dawn
now
as
the
opening
portals
of
a
beautiful
morning
although
at
the
time
my
thought
was
so
closely
centered
upon
other
things
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
glimmering
gold
of
the
sun
scarcely
left
an
impression
on
my
mind
it
was
still
early
morning
when
we
were
brought
out
under
heavy
guard
and
marched
somberly
forth
through
the
opened
gates
of
the
gaol
there
had
been
rain
during
the
night
and
the
of
the
village
street
were
dark
with
moisture
slipping
under
our
shoes
as
we
stumbled
along
down
the
sharp
incline
leading
to
the
wharf
ahead
we
could
perceive
a
forest
of
masts
and
what
seemed
like
a
vast
crowd
of
waiting
people
only
the
murmur
of
voices
greeting
us
as
we
emerged
told
that
this
gathering
was
not
a
hostile
one
and
this
truth
was
emphasized
to
our
minds
by
the
efforts
of
the
guard
to
hasten
our
passage
that
we
had
been
sentenced
to
exile
to
prolonged
servitude
in
some
foreign
land
was
all
that
any
of
us
knew
to
what
special
section
of
the
world
fate
had
allotted
us
remained
unknown
in
spite
of
curses
and
an
occasional
blow
we
advanced
slowly
marching
four
abreast
with
feet
dragging
heavily
the
chains
binding
us
together
clanking
dismally
with
each
step
and
an
armed
guard
between
each
file
experiences
have
been
many
since
then
yet
i
recall
as
though
it
were
but
yesterday
the
faces
of
those
who
walked
in
line
with
me
i
was
at
the
right
end
of
my
file
and
at
my
shoulder
was
a
boy
from
morrownest
a
slim
lad
his
weak
chin
trembling
from
fear
and
his
eyes
staring
about
so
pleadingly
i
spoke
a
word
of
courage
to
him
whispering
in
his
ear
lest
the
guard
behind
might
strike
he
glanced
aside
at
me
but
with
no
response
in
the
depths
of
his
eyes
in
which
i
could
perceive
only
a
dumb
anguish
of
despair
beyond
him
marched
grover
one
time
butcher
at
harwich
a
stocky
fellow
with
a
ghastly
sword
wound
yet
red
and
unhealed
on
his
face
extending
from
hair
to
chin
his
little
pig
eyes
glinting
ugly
and
his
lips
cursing
the
man
beyond
was
a
soldier
a
straight
athletic
fellow
with
crinkly
black
beard
who
kept
his
eyes
front
paying
no
heed
to
the
cries
the
guard
pressed
the
people
back
as
we
shuffled
along
but
there
was
no
way
of
keeping
them
still
i
heard
cries
of
encouragement
shouts
of
recognition
sobs
of
pity
and
occasionally
a
roar
of
anger
as
we
passed
good
lads
god

with
yer
thet
one

hurted
it
a
damn
shame

they
all
look
mighty
peaked
poor
devils
four
months
in
gaol
stand
back
there
now
stand
back
the
guards
prodded
them
savagely
with
the
butts
of
their
musketoons
thus
making
scant
room
for
us
to
shuffle
through
out
upon
the
far
end
of
the
wharf
where
we
were
finally
halted
abreast
of
a
lumping
brig
apparently
nearly
ready
for
sea
there
were
more
than
forty
of
us
as
i
counted
the
fellows
and
we
were
rounded
up
at
the
extremity
of
the
wharf
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
sun
with
a
line
of
guards
stretched
across
to
hold
back
the
crowd
until
preparations
had
been
completed
to
admit
us
aboard
as
those
in
front
flung
themselves
down
on
the
planks
i
got
view
of
the
brig
gangway
along
which
men
were
still
busily
hauling
belated
boxes
and
barrels
and
beyond
these
gained
glimpse
of
the
hooker
name
romping
betsy
of
plymouth
a
moment
later
a
sailor
passed
along
the
edge
of
the
dock
dragging
a
coil
of
rope
after
him
and
must
have
answered
some
hail
on
his
way
for
instantly
a
whisper
passed
swiftly
from
man
to
man
it
virginia
mate
we
bound
fer
virginia
the
ugly
little
pig
eyes
of
the
butcher
met
mine
virginia
hey
he
grunted
ye
a
sailorman
ai
ye
mate
well
then
whar
is
this
yere
virginia
the
boy
was
looking
at
me
also
questioningly
the
terror
in
his
face
by
no
means
lessened
at
the
sound
of
this
strange
word
yes
sir
please
where
is
it
sir
i
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
as
others
near
by
leaned
forward
to
catch
my
answer
that
all
right
mates
i
returned
cheerfully
it
across
the
blue
water
of
course
but
better
than
the
indies
we
fall
into
the
hands
of
englishmen
out
there
and
they
be
decent
to
us
but
whar
is
the
bloomin
hole
in
america
that
is
where
all
the
tobacco
comes
from
likely
that
will
be
our
job
raising
tobacco
have
ever
yer
bin
thar
ay
twice
and
to
a
land
beyond
they
call
maryland
tis
a
country
not
so
unlike
england
good
luck
that
then
tell
us
about
it
matie
i
endeavored
to
do
so
dwelling
upon
what
i
remembered
of
the
settlements
and
the
habits
of
the
people
but
saying
little
of
the
great
wilderness
of
the
interior
or
how
i
had
seen
slaves
toiling
in
the
fields
the
group
of
men
within
range
of
my
voice
leaned
forward
in
breathless
attention
one
now
and
then
asking
a
question
their
chains
rattling
with
each
movement
of
a
body
the
deep
interest
shown
in
their
faces
caused
me
unconsciously
to
elevate
my
voice
and
i
had
spoken
but
a
moment
or
two
before
a
hard
hand
gripped
my
shoulder
yer
better
stow
that
my
man
growled
someone
above
me
and
i
looked
up
into
the
stern
eyes
of
the
captain
of
the
guard
or
it
may
be
the
for
ye
yer
heard
the
orders
yes
sir
i
was
only
answering
questions
questions
what
the
hell
difference
does
it
make
to
this
scum
whar
they
go
do
yer
talkin
aboard
not
here
so
ye
been
ter
the
virginia
plantation
hev
ye
twice
sir
as
a
sailor
in
command
of
vessels
his
eyes
softened
slightly
and
a
different
tone
seemed
to
creep
into
his
voice
then
ye
must
be
master
carlyle
i
take
it
i
heerd
tell
about
ye
at
the
trial
but
supposed
ye
ter
be
an
older
man
i
am
ye
do
look
even
thet
it
my
notion
ye
got
an
overly
hard
dose
this
time
the
judge
was
in
ill
humor
thet
day
still
thet
not
fer
me
ter
talk
about
it
best
fer
both
of
us
ter
hold
our
tongues
ay
they
ready
fer
ye
now
fall
in
there
all
of
yer
step
along
yer
damn
rebel
scum
we
passed
aboard
over
the
narrow
four
abreast
dragging
our
feet
and
were
halted
on
the
forward
deck
while
artificers
removed
our
chains
as
these
were
knocked
off
the
released
prisoners
disappeared
one
by
one
down
the
forward
hatch
into
the
space
between
the
decks
which
had
been
roughly
fitted
up
for
their
confinement
during
the
long
voyage
as
my
position
was
in
one
of
the
last
files
i
had
ample
time
in
which
to
gaze
about
and
take
note
of
my
surroundings
except
for
the
presence
of
the
prisoners
the
deck
presented
no
unusual
scene
the
was
a
large
brig
not
overly
clean
and
had
evidently
been
in
commission
for
some
time
not
heavily
loaded
she
rode
high
and
was
a
vessel
with
comfortable
beam
i
knew
her
at
once
as
a
slow
sailor
and
bound
to
develop
a
decidedly
disagreeable
roll
in
any
considerable
sea
she
was
heavily
sparred
and
to
my
eye
her
canvas
appeared
unduly
and
rotten
indeed
there
was
unnecessary
clutter
aloft
and
an
amount
of
litter
about
the
deck
which
evidenced
lack
of
seamanship
nor
did
the
general
appearance
of
such
stray
members
of
the
crew
as
met
my
notice
add
appreciably
to
my
confidence
in
the
voyage
i
stared
aft
at
the
poop
deck
seeking
to
gain
glimpse
of
the
skipper
but
was
unable
to
determine
his
presence
among
the
others
there
were
a
number
of
persons
gathered
along
the
low
rail
attracted
by
the
unusual
spectacle
and
curiously
watching
us
being
herded
aboard
and
dispatched
below
but
to
judge
from
their
appearance
these
were
probably
all
passengers
some
of
them
adventurers
seeking
the
new
land
on
their
first
voyage
although
among
them
i
saw
others
easily
recognized
as
virginians
on
their
way
home
among
these
i
picked
out
a
planter
or
two
prosperous
and
noisy
men
who
had
just
disposed
of
their
tobacco
crop
well
satisfied
with
the
returns
some
artisans
sailing
on
contract
and
a
naval
officer
in
uniform
then
my
eyes
encountered
a
strange
group
foregathered
beside
the
lee
rail
there
were
four
in
the
little
party
but
one
of
these
was
a
negress
and
black
as
the
ace
of
spades
a
servant
evidently
standing
in
silence
behind
the
others
another
was
clearly
enough
a
colonial
proprietor
a
heavily
built
man
of
middle
age
purple
faced
and
wearing
the
broad
hat
with
uplifted
brim
characteristic
of
virginians
i
passed
these
by
with
a
glance
my
attention
concentrating
upon
the
other
two
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
standing
side
by
side
the
former
was
a
dashing
looking
blade
of
not
more
than
forty
attired
in
blue
slashed
coat
ornamented
with
gilt
buttons
and
bedecked
at
collar
and
cuffs
with
a
profusion
of
lace
a
saffron
colored
failed
to
conceal
his
richly
beruffled
shirt
and
the
hilt
of
a
rapier
was
rather
prominently
displayed
such
dandies
were
frequently
enough
seen
but
it
was
this
man
face
which
made
marked
contrast
with
his
gay
attire
he
was
dark
and
apparently
of
foreign
birth
with
black
moustache
tightly
clipped
so
as
to
reveal
the
thin
firmness
of
his
lips
and
even
at
that
distance
i
could
perceive
the
lines
of
a
scar
across
his
chin
altogether
there
was
an
audacity
to
his
face
a
daring
convincing
me
he
was
no
mere
lady
knight
but
one
to
whom
fighting
was
a
trade
he
was
pointing
us
out
to
his
companion
apparently
joking
over
our
appearance
in
an
endeavor
to
amuse
seemingly
she
gave
small
heed
to
his
words
for
although
her
eyes
followed
where
he
pointed
they
never
once
lighted
with
a
smile
nor
did
i
see
her
answer
his
sallies
she
was
scarcely
more
than
a
girl
dressed
very
simply
in
some
clinging
dark
stuff
with
a
loose
gray
cloak
draping
her
shoulders
and
a
small
neat
bonnet
of
straw
perched
upon
a
mass
of
coiled
hair
the
face
beneath
was
sweetly
piquant
with
dark
eyes
and
rounded
cheeks
flushed
with
health
she
stood
both
hands
clasping
the
rail
watching
us
intently
i
somehow
felt
as
though
her
eyes
were
upon
me
and
within
their
depths
even
at
that
distance
i
seemed
to
read
a
message
of
sympathy
and
kindness
the
one
lasting
impression
her
face
left
on
my
memory
was
that
of
innocent
girlhood
dignified
by
a
womanly
tenderness
what
were
those
two
to
each
other
i
could
not
guess
for
they
seemed
from
two
utterly
different
worlds
not
brother
and
sister
surely
and
not
lovers
the
last
was
unthinkable
perhaps
mere
chance
acquaintances
who
had
drifted
together
since
coming
aboard
it
seems
strange
that
at
such
a
moment
my
attention
should
have
thus
centered
on
these
two
yet
i
think
now
that
either
one
would
have
awakened
my
interest
wherever
we
had
met
instinctively
i
disliked
the
man
aware
of
an
instant
antagonism
realizing
that
he
was
evil
while
his
companion
came
to
me
as
revealment
of
all
that
was
true
and
worthy
in
a
degree
i
had
never
known
before
i
could
not
banish
either
from
my
mind
for
months
i
had
been
in
prison
expecting
a
death
sentence
much
of
the
time
passed
in
solitary
confinement
and
now
with
that
cloud
lifted
i
had
come
forth
into
a
fresh
existence
only
to
be
confronted
by
this
man
and
woman
representing
exact
opposites
their
peculiarities
took
immediate
possession
of
a
mind
entirely
unoccupied
nor
did
i
make
any
effort
to
banish
them
from
my
thought
from
the
instant
i
looked
upon
these
two
i
felt
convinced
that
through
some
strange
vagary
of
fate
we
were
destined
to
know
more
of
each
other
that
our
life
lines
were
ordained
to
touch
and
become
entangled
somewhere
in
that
mystery
of
the
western
world
to
which
i
had
been
condemned
i
can
not
analyze
this
conception
but
merely
record
its
presence
the
thought
took
firm
possession
of
me
under
the
circumstances
i
was
too
far
away
to
overhear
conversation
the
shuffling
of
feet
the
rattling
of
chains
the
harsh
voices
of
the
guard
made
it
impossible
to
distinguish
any
words
passing
between
the
two
i
could
only
watch
them
quickly
assured
that
i
had
likewise
attracted
the
girl
attention
and
that
her
gaze
occasionally
sought
mine
then
the
guards
came
to
me
and
with
my
limbs
freed
of
fetters
i
was
passed
down
the
steep
ladder
into
the
between
decks
where
we
were
to
be
confined
the
haunting
memory
of
her
face
accompanied
me
below
already
so
clearly
defined
as
to
be
unforgettable
it
proved
a
dismal
crowded
hole
in
which
we
were
quartered
like
so
many
cattle
it
being
merely
a
small
space
forward
hastily
boxed
off
by
rough
lumber
the
sides
and
ends
built
up
into
tiers
of
bunks
the
only
ventilation
and
light
furnished
by
the
open
hatch
above
the
place
was
clean
enough
being
newly
fitted
for
the
purpose
but
was
totally
devoid
of
furnishings
the
only
concession
to
comfort
visible
was
a
handful
of
fresh
straw
in
each
bunk
the
men
herded
and
driven
down
the
ladder
were
crowded
into
the
central
space
the
majority
still
on
their
feet
but
a
few
squatting
dejectedly
on
the
deck
in
the
dim
twilight
of
that
bare
interior
their
faces
scarcely
appeared
natural
and
they
conversed
in
undertones
most
of
the
fellows
were
sober
and
silent
not
a
bad
lot
to
my
judgment
with
only
here
and
there
a
countenance
exhibiting
viciousness
or
a
tongue
given
to
ribaldry
i
could
remember
seeing
but
few
of
them
before
yet
as
i
observed
them
more
closely
now
realized
that
these
were
not
criminals
being
punished
for
crime
but
men
caught
as
i
had
been
and
condemned
without
fair
trial
through
the
lies
of
paid
informers
i
could
even
read
in
their
actions
and
words
the
simple
stories
of
their
former
lives
the
farm
laborer
the
sailor
the
now
all
on
one
common
level
of
misfortune
and
misery
condemned
alike
to
exile
to
servitude
in
a
strange
land
beyond
seas
the
ticket
given
me
called
by
number
for
a
certain
berth
and
i
sought
until
i
found
this
throwing
within
the
small
bundle
i
bore
and
then
finding
a
chance
to
sit
down
on
the
deck
beneath
the
last
of
the
bunch
of
prisoners
dribbled
down
the
ladder
each
in
turn
noisily
greeted
by
those
already
huddled
below
i
began
to
recognize
the
increasing
foulness
of
air
and
to
distinguish
words
of
conversation
from
the
groups
about
me
there
was
but
little
profanity
but
some
rough
and
a
marked
effort
to
pretend
indifference
i
could
make
out
and
mere
boys
mingling
together
and
occasionally
a
man
in
some
semblance
of
uniform
a
few
bore
wounds
and
the
clothes
of
several
were
in
rags
all
alike
exhibited
marks
of
suffering
and
hardship
the
butcher
from
harwich
and
the
lad
who
had
marched
beside
me
down
the
wharf
were
not
to
be
seen
from
where
i
sat
although
beyond
doubt
they
were
somewhere
in
the
crowd
the
hatch
was
not
lowered
and
gazing
up
through
the
square
opening
i
obtained
glimpse
of
two
soldiers
on
guard
the
sunlight
glinting
on
their
guns
almost
immediately
there
was
the
sound
of
tramping
feet
on
the
deck
above
and
the
creaking
of
blocks
then
a
sudden
movement
of
the
hull
told
all
we
were
under
way
this
was
recognized
by
a
roar
of
voices
chapter
ii
the
prison
ship
the
greater
portion
of
that
voyage
i
would
blot
entirely
from
memory
if
possible
i
can
not
hope
to
describe
it
in
any
detail
foul
smells
the
discomfort
the
ceaseless
horror
of
food
the
close
companionship
of
men
turned
into
mere
animals
by
suffering
and
distress
the
wearisome
days
the
black
sleepless
nights
the
poisonous
air
and
the
brutality
of
guards
i
can
never
forget
these
things
for
they
have
scarred
my
soul
yet
surely
i
need
not
dwell
upon
them
now
except
as
they
may
bear
some
direct
reference
to
this
tale
i
seek
to
tell
as
such
those
weeks
can
not
be
wholly
ignored
for
they
form
a
part
of
the
events
to
follow
events
which
might
not
be
clearly
understood
without
their
proper
picturing
we
were
days
at
sea
driven
once
so
far
to
the
southward
by
a
severe
storm
which
struck
us
the
second
day
out
as
to
sight
the
north
coast
of
africa
before
we
were
able
to
resume
our
westward
course
to
those
of
us
who
were
tightly
shut
into
those
miserable
quarters
below
these
facts
came
only
as
floating
rumors
yet
the
intense
suffering
involved
was
all
real
enough
for
hours
we
were
battened
down
in
darkness
flung
desperately
about
by
every
mad
plunge
of
the
vessel
stifled
by
poisoned
air
and
noxious
odors
and
all
that
time
without
a
particle
of
food
if
i
suffered
less
than
some
others
it
was
simply
because
i
was
more
accustomed
to
the
sea
i
was
not
nauseated
by
the
motion
nor
unduly
frightened
by
the
wild
pitching
of
the
brig
lying
quietly
in
my
berth
braced
to
prevent
being
thrown
out
amid
a
darkness
so
intense
as
to
seem
a
weight
every
sound
from
the
deck
above
every
lift
of
the
vessel
brought
to
my
mind
a
sea
message
convincing
me
of
two
things
that
the
was
a
staunch
craft
and
well
handled
terrific
as
the
gale
became
i
only
grew
more
confident
that
she
would
safely
weather
it
yet
god
knows
it
was
horrible
enough
even
to
lie
there
and
listen
to
feel
the
hurling
plunges
downward
the
dizzy
upsweeping
of
the
hull
to
hear
the
cries
groans
and
prayers
of
frightened
men
unseen
and
helpless
in
the
darkness
the
creaking
timbers
the
resounding
blows
of
the
waves
against
the
sides
the
horrid
retching
of
the
sick
the
snarling
angry
voices
as
the
struggling
mass
was
flung
back
and
forth
the
curses
hurled
madly
into
the
darkness
they
were
no
longer
men
but
infuriated
brutes
so
steeped
in
agony
and
fear
as
to
have
lost
all
human
instincts
they
snarled
and
snapped
like
so
many
beasts
their
voices
unrecognizable
the
stronger
treading
the
weaker
to
the
deck
i
could
not
see
i
could
only
hear
yet
i
lay
there
staring
blindly
about
conscious
of
every
horror
and
so
weak
and
unnerved
as
to
tremble
like
a
child
yet
the
complete
knowledge
of
what
had
actually
occurred
in
that
frightful
hole
was
only
revealed
when
the
violence
of
the
storm
finally
ceased
and
the
guards
above
again
lifted
the
hatch
the
gray
light
of
dawn
faintly
illumined
the
inferno
below
and
the
sweet
breath
of
morning
air
swept
down
among
us
then
i
saw
the
haggard
uplifted
faces
the
arms
tossed
aloft
and
heard
the
wild
yell
as
the
stronger
charged
forward
struggling
for
the
foot
of
the
ladder
the
place
was
a
foul
reeking
shambles
so
filthy
as
to
be
positively
sickening
with
motionless
bodies
stretched
here
and
there
along
the
deck
sailors
and
guards
fought
their
way
down
among
us
driving
back
the
unarmed
wretches
who
sought
to
oppose
their
progress
while
others
bore
to
the
deck
above
those
who
were
too
helpless
to
rise
there
were
five
dead
among
them
and
twice
as
many
more
who
had
lost
consciousness
these
were
all
removed
first
and
then
feeling
helpless
to
resist
the
rush
the
others
were
permitted
to
clamber
up
the
ladder
surging
out
upon
the
deck
we
were
hurdled
against
the
lee
rail
menaced
by
leveled
guns
and
thus
finally
fed
while
the
filthy
quarters
below
were
hastily
cleansed
it
was
a
dark
lowering
morning
the
desolate
sea
still
threateningly
rough
the
heavy
clouds
hanging
low
the
was
hove
to
under
bare
poles
a
bit
of
the
jib
alone
showing
with
decks
and
spars
exhibiting
evidence
of
the
terrific
struggle
to
keep
afloat
i
never
witnessed
wilder
pitching
on
any
vessel
but
the
fresh
air
brought
new
life
to
the
wretches
about
me
and
a
species
of
cheerfulness
was
quickly
manifested
bad
as
the
food
was
we
ate
it
gladly
nor
did
the
memory
of
the
dead
already
laid
out
on
the
main
deck
long
depress
us
why
should
we
mourn
for
them
we
scarcely
knew
any
among
them
by
name
and
facing
the
uncertainty
of
our
own
fate
each
man
secretly
felt
that
these
had
possibly
found
the
easier
way
our
own
misery
was
now
greater
than
theirs
so
we
hung
on
to
whatever
would
help
us
to
keep
erect
and
ate
the
food
given
us
like
famished
animals
rough
and
threatening
as
the
surroundings
still
were
i
was
seaman
enough
to
realize
that
the
backbone
of
the
storm
had
broken
and
so
rejoiced
when
the
skipper
ordered
sail
set
in
a
few
moments
the
brig
was
once
again
headed
on
a
westerly
course
and
riding
the
heavy
seas
much
more
steadily
we
were
permitted
to
remain
on
deck
scarcely
more
than
an
hour
and
during
that
time
only
a
very
few
passengers
made
their
appearance
aft
although
watching
eagerly
i
perceived
no
flutter
of
a
skirt
in
the
wind
but
the
spanish
looking
man
emerged
from
below
and
clung
to
the
rail
for
several
minutes
before
we
were
ordered
from
deck
he
spoke
with
the
captain
pointing
and
gesticulating
and
the
few
detached
words
blown
to
me
on
the
wind
were
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
the
fellow
knew
ships
and
the
sea
i
had
thought
him
a
mere
dandy
but
now
saw
in
him
harder
stuff
even
getting
close
enough
to
learn
that
he
had
visited
america
before
and
possessed
knowledge
of
its
shores
and
currents
ay
and
he
spoke
english
well
with
never
pause
for
a
word
even
to
terms
of
seamanship
a
bit
obscure
the
next
few
days
while
uneventful
sufficed
to
make
our
discipline
complete
obedience
being
roughly
enforced
by
blows
and
oaths
at
first
a
spirit
of
resistance
flamed
high
but
the
truly
desperate
among
us
were
few
and
without
leadership
while
the
majority
were
already
thoroughly
cowed
by
months
of
imprisonment
left
to
themselves
the
more
reckless
and
criminal
were
soon
obliged
to
yield
to
force
so
that
nothing
more
serious
resulted
than
loud
talk
and
threats
the
hatch
above
remained
open
but
carefully
guarded
night
and
day
while
we
were
permitted
on
deck
for
air
and
exercise
only
in
squads
of
ten
two
hours
out
of
every
this
alone
served
to
break
the
dread
monotony
of
the
voyage
for
while
we
almost
constantly
encountered
baffling
head
winds
no
other
storm
of
any
magnitude
obstructed
our
passage
the
brig
carried
heavy
canvas
and
the
skipper
loaded
her
with
all
she
could
bear
but
at
that
she
was
a
slow
sailor
dipping
so
deeply
in
a
seaway
as
to
ship
considerable
water
even
in
quiet
weather
from
our
exercise
on
deck
we
generally
returned
below
drenched
to
the
skin
but
glad
to
even
pay
that
price
for
two
hours
of
fresh
air
and
an
opportunity
to
gaze
about
at
sea
and
sky
there
was
little
else
to
witness
for
in
all
the
long
voyage
we
encountered
but
one
vessel
in
that
desolate
ocean
a
french
armed
corvette
fairly
bristling
with
guns
which
ran
in
close
enough
to
hail
us
but
seemed
satisfied
to
permit
us
to
pass
unvisited
i
clung
to
the
rail
and
watched
its
white
sails
disappear
until
they
resembled
the
wings
of
gulls
feeling
more
than
ever
conscious
of
our
helplessness
there
were
few
among
the
prisoners
i
had
any
desire
to
companion
with
only
two
as
i
recall
now
a
law
clerk
from
sussex
a
rather
bright
young
fellow
but
full
of
strange
notions
and
an
older
man
who
had
seen
service
in
flanders
we
messed
together
and
pledged
mutual
friendship
in
the
new
land
a
pledge
not
destined
to
be
fulfilled
as
i
never
again
saw
nor
heard
of
the
former
after
we
went
ashore
and
the
last
glimpse
i
had
of
the
older
man
was
as
he
was
being
loaded
into
a
cart
bound
for
some
interior
plantation
god
grant
they
both
lived
and
became
again
free
men
how
those
sodden
hours
and
days
dragged
how
long
were
those
black
nights
in
which
i
lay
sleepless
listening
to
indescribable
noises
and
breathing
the
rank
poisonous
air
the
short
time
passed
on
deck
was
my
only
solace
and
yet
even
there
i
found
little
to
interest
except
a
continuous
new
hope
we
were
herded
well
forward
a
rope
dividing
us
from
the
main
deck
which
space
the
passengers
aft
used
as
a
promenade
here
between
the
foremast
and
the
cabin
someone
was
strolling
idly
about
most
of
the
time
or
lounging
along
the
rail
out
of
the
sun
in
time
i
came
to
recognize
them
all
by
sight
and
learned
in
one
way
or
another
something
of
their
characteristics
and
purpose
in
taking
this
voyage
they
were
not
an
unusual
lot
the
majority
planters
from
the
colonies
homeward
bound
with
occasionally
a
new
emigrant
about
to
try
for
fortune
beyond
seas
together
with
one
or
two
naval
officers
there
were
only
three
women
aboard
a
fat
dowager
the
young
lady
i
had
noticed
at
embarkation
and
her
colored
maid
many
of
the
days
were
pleasant
with
quiet
sea
and
bright
sunshine
and
the
younger
woman
must
have
passed
hours
on
deck
during
so
long
and
tedious
a
voyage
yet
it
chanced
i
saw
almost
nothing
of
her
i
heard
her
presence
on
board
discussed
several
times
by
others
of
our
company
but
it
somehow
chanced
that
during
my
time
in
the
open
she
was
usually
below
indeed
i
gained
but
one
glimpse
of
the
lady
in
the
first
two
weeks
at
sea
and
then
only
as
we
were
being
ordered
down
to
our
quarters
for
the
night
just
as
i
was
approaching
the
hatch
to
descend
she
appeared
from
within
the
cabin
accompanied
by
the
planter
and
the
two
advanced
toward
the
rail
the
younger
gallant
who
was
standing
there
alone
saw
them
the
moment
they
emerged
and
hastened
forward
bowing
low
hat
in
hand
she
barely
recognized
him
her
gaze
traveling
beyond
the
fellow
toward
the
disappearing
line
of
prisoners
it
was
an
evening
promising
storm
with
some
motion
to
the
sea
and
a
heavy
bank
of
clouds
visible
off
the
port
quarter
brightened
by
flashes
of
zigzag
lightning
the
brig
rolled
dizzily
so
the
cavalier
sought
to
steady
her
steps
but
she
only
laughed
at
the
effort
waving
him
aside
as
she
moved
easily
forward
once
with
hand
on
the
rail
she
ignored
his
presence
entirely
looking
first
at
the
threatening
cloud
and
then
permitting
her
gaze
to
rest
once
more
upon
the
line
of
men
descending
through
the
hatch
it
had
become
my
turn
to
go
down
yet
in
that
instant
our
eyes
met
fairly
and
i
instantly
knew
she
saw
and
recognized
me
for
a
single
second
our
glances
clung
as
though
some
mysterious
influence
held
us
to
each
other
then
the
angry
guard
struck
me
with
the
stock
of
his
piece
what
er
ye
standin
thar
fer
he
demanded
savagely
go
on
down
lively
now
i
saw
her
clasping
fingers
convulsively
grip
the
rail
and
even
at
that
distance
marked
a
sudden
flame
of
color
in
her
cheeks
that
was
all
her
message
to
me
yet
quite
enough
although
we
had
never
spoken
although
our
names
were
yet
unknown
i
was
no
criminal
to
her
mind
no
unrecognized
prisoner
beneath
contempt
but
a
human
being
in
whom
she
already
felt
a
personal
interest
and
to
whom
she
extended
thought
and
sympathy
the
blow
of
the
bruised
my
back
yet
it
was
with
a
smile
and
a
light
heart
that
i
descended
the
ladder
deeply
conscious
of
a
friend
on
board
one
totally
unable
to
serve
me
perhaps
yet
nevertheless
a
friend
even
in
our
isolation
guarded
in
those
narrow
quarters
much
of
the
ship
gossip
managed
in
some
way
to
reach
our
ears
how
it
drifted
in
was
often
a
mystery
yet
there
was
little
going
on
aboard
we
failed
to
hear
much
of
it
came
to
us
through
those
detailed
to
serve
food
while
guards
and
sailors
were
not
always
averse
to
being
talked
with
we
always
knew
the
course
and
i
managed
to
keep
in
my
mind
a
very
dear
idea
of
how
the
voyage
progressed
not
a
great
deal
of
this
gossip
however
related
to
the
passengers
aft
who
kept
rather
exclusively
to
themselves
nor
did
i
feel
inclined
to
question
those
who
might
have
the
information
i
had
no
wish
to
reveal
my
interest
to
others
and
so
continued
entirely
ignorant
of
the
identity
of
the
young
woman
she
remained
in
my
memory
in
my
thoughts
nameless
a
dream
rather
than
a
reality
i
did
learn
quite
by
accident
that
the
gay
gallant
was
a
wealthy
spaniard
supposedly
of
high
birth
by
name
sanchez
and
at
one
time
in
the
naval
service
and
likewise
ascertained
that
the
rotund
planter
so
evidently
in
the
party
was
a
certain
roger
fairfax
of
saint
mary
in
maryland
homeward
bound
after
a
successful
sale
of
his
tobacco
crop
in
london
it
was
during
his
visit
to
the
great
city
that
he
had
met
sanchez
and
his
praise
of
the
colonies
had
induced
the
latter
to
essay
a
voyage
in
his
company
to
america
but
strange
enough
no
one
so
much
as
mentioned
the
girl
in
connection
with
either
man
thus
it
was
that
the
drove
steadily
on
her
way
into
the
west
either
battered
by
storm
or
idly
drifting
in
calm
while
life
on
board
became
a
tiresome
routine
the
dullness
and
ill
treatment
led
to
trouble
below
to
dissatisfaction
and
angry
outbreaks
of
temper
the
prisoners
grew
quarrelsome
among
themselves
and
mutinous
toward
their
guards
i
took
no
part
in
these
affairs
which
at
one
time
became
serious
two
men
were
shot
dead
and
twice
afterwards
bodies
were
carried
up
the
ladder
at
dawn
and
silently
consigned
to
the
sea
no
doubt
these
tales
more
or
less
exaggerated
traveled
aft
and
reached
the
eager
ears
of
the
passengers
they
began
to
fear
us
and
consequently
i
noticed
when
on
deck
the
promenade
once
so
popular
during
the
earlier
days
of
the
voyage
was
almost
totally
deserted
during
our
hours
of
recreation
so
with
mutiny
forward
and
fear
aft
the
lumbering
old
brig
full
of
tragedy
and
hopeless
hearts
ploughed
steadily
onward
toward
the
sunset
chapter
iii
dorothy
fairfax
we
were
not
far
from
two
hundred
miles
east
of
the
capes
or
at
least
so
one
of
the
mates
told
me
gruffly
answering
a
question
and
it
was
already
growing
twilight
the
sun
having
disappeared
a
half
hour
before
there
was
but
little
air
stirring
barely
enough
to
keep
the
sails
taut
while
the
swell
of
the
sea
was
sufficient
to
be
uncomfortable
making
walking
on
the
deck
a
task
we
were
wallowing
along
amid
a
waste
of
waters
the
waves
extending
in
every
direction
to
the
far
horizons
which
were
already
purpling
with
the
approach
of
night
i
had
been
closely
confined
to
my
bunk
for
two
days
with
illness
but
now
somewhat
stronger
had
been
ordered
on
deck
by
the
surgeon
the
last
batch
of
prisoners
after
their
short
hour
of
recreation
had
been
returned
to
the
quarters
below
but
i
was
permitted
to
remain
alone
undisturbed
i
sat
there
quietly
perched
on
a
coil
of
rope
with
head
just
high
enough
to
permit
an
unobstructed
view
over
the
side
the
deck
aft
was
almost
deserted
the
passengers
being
at
supper
in
the
cabin
i
could
glimpse
them
through
the
unshaded
windows
seated
about
a
long
table
while
occasionally
the
sound
of
their
voices
reached
me
through
the
open
the
mate
was
alone
on
the
poop
tramping
steadily
back
and
forth
his
glance
wandering
from
the
sea
alongside
to
the
flapping
canvas
above
but
remained
silent
as
the
brig
was
on
her
course
once
he
clambered
down
the
side
ladder
and
walked
forward
shouting
out
some
order
to
a
group
of
sailors
under
the
lee
of
the
forecastle
it
was
on
his
return
that
i
ventured
to
question
him
and
was
gruffly
answered
something
i
said
however
gave
him
knowledge
that
i
was
a
seaman
and
he
paused
a
moment
more
civilly
before
resuming
his
watch
even
pointing
out
what
resembled
the
gleam
of
a
distant
sail
far
away
on
our
starboard
quarter
this
was
such
a
dim
speck
against
the
darkening
horizon
that
i
stood
up
to
see
better
shadowing
my
eyes
and
forgetful
of
all
else
in
aroused
interest
undoubtedly
it
was
a
sail
although
appearing
no
larger
than
a
gull
wing
and
my
imagination
took
me
in
spirit
across
the
leagues
of
water
i
was
still
standing
there
absorbed
unaware
even
that
the
mate
had
departed
when
a
voice
and
feminine
broke
the
silence
may
i
speak
with
you
i
turned
instantly
so
thoroughly
surprised
my
voice
faltered
as
i
gazed
into
the
upturned
face
of
the
questioner
she
stood
directly
beside
me
with
only
the
rope
barrier
stretched
between
us
her
head
uncovered
the
contour
of
her
face
softened
by
the
twilight
instantly
my
cap
was
off
and
i
was
bowing
courteously
most
certainly
with
a
quick
side
glance
toward
the
guard
but
i
am
a
prisoner
of
course
i
know
that
in
smiling
confidence
only
you
see
i
am
rather
a
privileged
character
on
board
no
one
expects
me
to
obey
rules
still
that
does
not
apply
to
you
does
it
hesitating
slightly
perhaps
you
may
be
punished
if
you
talk
with
me
is
that
what
you
meant
i
am
more
than
willing
to
assume
the
risk
punishment
is
no
new
experience
to
me
besides
just
now
i
am
on
sick
leave
and
privileged
that
accounts
for
my
being
still
on
deck
and
i
chanced
to
find
you
here
alone
you
have
been
ill
not
seriously
but
confined
to
the
berth
for
a
couple
of
days
and
now
the
doctor
prescribes
fresh
air
this
meeting
with
you
i
imagine
may
prove
even
of
greater
benefit
than
that
with
me
oh
you
mean
as
a
relief
from
loneliness
partly
yes
the
voyage
has
certainly
proven
lonely
enough
i
have
made
few
friends
forward
and
am
even
bold
enough
to
say
that
i
have
longed
for
a
word
with
you
ever
since
i
first
saw
you
aboard
why
especially
with
me
rather
a
hard
question
to
answer
at
the
very
beginning
i
smiled
back
at
her
yet
not
so
difficult
as
the
one
i
shall
ask
you
except
for
a
fat
matron
and
a
colored
maid
you
chance
to
be
the
only
woman
on
board
can
you
consider
it
unnatural
that
i
should
feel
an
interest
on
the
other
hand
i
am
only
one
of
fifty
prisoners
scarcely
cleaner
or
more
reputable
looking
than
any
of
my
mates
yet
surely
you
have
not
sought
speech
with
these
others
no
then
why
especially
with
me
even
in
the
growing
dusk
i
could
mark
a
red
flush
mount
into
the
clear
cheeks
at
this
insistent
question
and
for
an
instant
her
eyes
wavered
but
she
possessed
the
courage
of
pride
and
her
hesitancy
was
short
you
imagine
i
can
not
answer
indeed
that
i
have
no
worthy
reason
she
exclaimed
oh
but
i
have
i
know
who
you
are
my
uncle
pointed
you
out
to
me
your
uncle
the
planter
in
the
gray
coat
yes
i
am
traveling
home
with
him
to
maryland
i
am
dorothy
fairfax
but
even
with
that
explanation
i
scarcely
understand
i
insisted
rather
stubbornly
you
say
he
pointed
me
out
to
you
really
i
was
not
aware
that
i
was
a
distinguished
character
of
any
kind
how
did
he
happen
to
know
me
because
he
was
present
at
your
trial
before
lord
jeffries
he
merely
chanced
to
be
there
when
you
were
first
brought
up
but
became
interested
in
the
case
and
so
returned
to
hear
you
sentenced
you
are
geoffry
carlyle
in
command
of
the
ship
that
brought
monmouth
to
england
i
heard
it
all
all
what
else
pray
her
eyes
opened
widely
in
sudden
surprise
and
she
clasped
and
unclasped
her
hands
nervously
do
you
really
not
know
have
you
never
been
told
what
happened
only
that
i
was
roughly
forbidden
to
speak
called
every
foul
name
the
learned
judge
could
think
of
and
then
sentenced
to
twenty
years
penal
servitude
beyond
seas
i
answered
soberly
following
that
i
was
dragged
from
the
dock
and
flung
into
a
cell
was
there
anything
else
why
you
should
have
known
lord
jeffries
sentenced
you
to
death
the
decree
was
signed
to
be
executed
immediately
then
influence
was
brought
to
bear
some
nobleman
in
northumberland
made
direct
appeal
to
the
king
that
was
what
angered
jeffries
so
an
appeal
for
me
good
god
not
bucclough
was
it
he
the
duke
yes
it
was
whispered
about
that
the
king
was
in
his
debt
some
word
of
honor
and
dare
not
refuse
the
word
of
mercy
came
just
in
time
ordering
jeffries
to
commute
your
sentence
at
first
he
swore
hang
you
king
or
no
king
but
his
nerve
failed
my
uncle
said
he
roared
like
a
bull
this
bucclough
is
he
not
your
friend
i
hesitated
for
an
instant
of
indecision
looking
into
her
face
but
the
truth
would
not
be
denied
scarcely
that
i
said
soberly
nor
can
i
solve
entirely
his
purpose
he
is
my
brother
and
i
am
the
next
in
line
we
are
not
even
on
speaking
terms
yet
he
is
childless
and
may
feel
some
measure
of
dislike
to
have
the
family
end
in
a
hangman
knot
i
can
think
of
no
other
reason
for
his
interference
i
knew
nothing
of
his
action
i
am
glad
it
became
my
privilege
to
tell
you
besides
captain
carlyle
simply
it
may
also
help
you
to
understand
my
interest
if
you
are
of
the
carlyles
of
bucclough
how
happened
it
that
you
went
to
sea
largely
necessity
and
to
some
extent
no
doubt
sheer
love
of
adventure
i
was
a
younger
son
with
very
little
income
there
were
then
two
lives
between
me
and
the
estate
and
the
old
duke
my
father
treated
me
like
a
servant
i
always
loved
the
sea
and
at
fourteen
to
get
me
out
of
his
sight
i
think
largely
was
apprenticed
to
the
navy
but
lost
my
grade
in
the
service
by
a
mere
boyish
prank
his
influence
then
would
have
saved
me
but
he
refused
to
even
read
my
letter
of
explanation
i
dare
not
return
home
in
such
disgrace
and
consequently
drifted
into
the
merchant
service
it
is
a
story
quickly
told
yet
not
so
quickly
lived
no
it
meant
many
hard
years
on
all
the
oceans
of
the
world
this
is
the
first
message
reaching
me
from
the
old
home
i
have
seen
that
home
she
said
quietly
and
shall
never
forget
the
impression
it
made
on
me
a
beautiful
place
i
was
there
on
a
coaching
party
the
first
summer
i
was
in
england
i
was
a
mere
girl
then
and
everything
seemed
wonderful
i
have
been
away
from
maryland
now
for
three
years
at
school
of
course
nothing
else
would
satisfy
father
maryland
is
only
a
colony
you
know
yes
i
understand
a
great
many
over
there
send
back
their
sons
and
daughters
to
be
educated
your
home
is
at
saint
mary
lower
down
the
potomac
have
you
ever
been
there
twice
once
as
mate
and
the
last
time
as
master
of
a
ship
my
latest
voyage
in
these
waters
was
made
nearly
two
years
ago
she
was
silent
for
several
moments
her
face
turned
away
from
me
her
eyes
gazing
out
across
the
waste
of
waters
which
were
already
growing
dark
her
profile
against
the
yellow
light
of
the
cabin
windows
appeared
most
attractive
it
is
not
so
strange
then
is
it
that
i
should
have
felt
interested
in
you
she
asked
suddenly
as
though
justifying
herself
when
uncle
roger
first
told
me
who
you
were
and
then
explained
what
had
occurred
at
your
trial
naturally
you
became
to
me
something
entirely
different
from
the
others
certainly
i
am
not
inclined
to
condemn
i
never
once
thought
of
speaking
to
you
truly
i
did
not
she
went
on
simply
but
when
i
saw
you
sitting
here
all
alone
the
impulse
came
suddenly
to
tell
you
how
sorry
i
was
you
see
and
she
paused
doubtfully
girls
brought
up
in
the
colonies
as
i
have
been
are
are
not
quite
so
careful
about
whom
they
talk
with
as
in
england
you
know
what
i
mean
we
always
have
indentured
servants
and
become
accustomed
to
them
it
it
is
quite
different
out
there
i
laughed
thinking
only
to
relieve
her
embarrassment
believe
me
miss
dorothy
there
is
no
thought
in
my
mind
that
you
have
done
wrong
i
insisted
swiftly
that
would
be
very
ungrateful
for
you
have
brought
me
new
heart
and
hope
then
i
am
not
sorry
were
you
actually
with
monmouth
in
sympathy
yes
but
i
had
no
hand
in
the
actual
fighting
i
was
not
even
ashore
until
it
was
all
over
with
still
i
shall
pay
my
share
of
the
bill
and
you
know
what
that
means
do
you
not
what
will
happen
when
we
reach
virginia
perfectly
i
have
no
illusions
i
have
seen
just
such
ships
as
this
come
in
we
are
to
be
advertised
and
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
a
week
from
now
i
shall
probably
be
out
in
the
tobacco
fields
under
the
whip
of
an
overseer
who
will
call
me
jeff
all
i
can
hope
for
is
a
master
and
an
early
opportunity
to
escape
oh
no
and
in
her
eagerness
her
hands
actually
clasped
mine
where
they
clung
to
the
rope
between
us
it
is
not
going
to
be
quite
so
bad
as
that
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
is
what
gave
me
boldness
to
come
across
here
to
you
tonight
it
has
all
been
arranged
arranged
yes
everything
you
are
not
going
to
be
sold
on
the
block
with
those
others
uncle
roger
has
already
contracted
with
the
captain
for
your
services
you
are
going
north
with
us
to
maryland
i
stared
through
the
dusk
into
her
animated
face
scarcely
comprehending
do
you
not
understand
yet
she
asked
the
captain
of
this
brig
is
the
agent
he
represents
the
government
and
is
obliged
to
find
places
for
the
prisoners
yes
i
know
that
we
are
billed
like
so
much
livestock
he
must
account
for
every
head
well
uncle
roger
went
to
him
yesterday
and
made
a
bid
for
you
finally
they
came
to
terms
that
is
one
reason
why
you
are
left
alone
here
on
deck
tonight
the
officers
are
no
longer
responsible
for
you
you
are
already
indentured
i
drew
a
deep
breath
and
in
the
sudden
impulse
of
relief
which
swept
over
me
my
own
fingers
closed
tightly
about
her
hands
you
tell
me
i
am
to
accompany
your
party
up
the
chesapeake
yes
i
owe
this
to
you
i
am
sure
i
must
owe
this
to
you
tell
me
her
eyes
drooped
and
in
the
dim
light
i
could
mark
the
heaving
of
her
bosom
as
she
caught
her
breath
only
only
the
suggestion
she
managed
to
say
in
a
whisper
he
he
was
glad
of
that
you
see
i
i
knew
he
needed
someone
to
take
charge
of
his
sloop
and
and
so
i
brought
you
to
his
mind
we
we
both
thought
you
would
be
just
the
one
and
and
he
went
right
away
to
see
the
captain
so
please
do
thank
me
i
shall
never
cease
to
thank
you
i
returned
warmly
conscious
suddenly
that
i
was
holding
her
hands
and
as
instantly
releasing
them
why
do
you
begin
to
understand
what
this
actually
means
to
me
it
means
the
retention
of
manhood
of
it
will
save
me
the
degradation
which
i
dreaded
most
of
all
the
toiling
in
the
fields
beside
negro
slaves
and
the
sting
of
the
lash
ay
it
means
even
more
i
hesitated
instantly
realizing
that
i
must
not
utter
those
impetuous
words
leaping
to
my
lips
more
she
exclaimed
what
more
this
i
went
on
my
thought
shifting
into
a
new
channel
a
longer
servitude
up
to
this
moment
my
one
dream
has
been
to
escape
but
i
must
give
that
up
now
you
have
placed
me
under
obligations
to
serve
you
mean
you
feel
personally
bound
yes
not
quite
so
much
to
your
uncle
perhaps
as
to
yourself
but
between
us
this
has
become
a
debt
of
honor
but
wait
she
said
earnestly
for
i
had
even
thought
of
that
i
was
sure
you
would
feel
that
way
any
gentleman
would
still
there
is
a
way
out
you
were
sentenced
as
an
indentured
servant
i
suppose
so
it
is
true
you
were
so
entered
on
the
books
of
this
ship
uncle
roger
had
to
be
sure
of
all
this
before
he
paid
his
money
and
i
saw
the
entry
myself
it
read
carlyle
master
mariner
indentured
to
the
colonies
for
the
term
of
twenty
years
unless
sooner
released
crime
high
treason
surely
you
must
know
the
meaning
of
those
words
servitude
for
twenty
years
sooner
released
that
means
pardoned
there
is
no
hope
of
that
perhaps
not
but
that
is
not
all
it
means
any
indentured
man
under
our
maryland
laws
can
buy
his
freedom
after
serving
a
certain
proportion
of
his
sentence
i
think
it
is
true
in
any
of
the
colonies
did
you
not
know
that
i
did
know
it
yet
somehow
had
never
connected
the
fact
before
directly
with
my
own
case
i
had
been
sentenced
to
twenty
years
twenty
years
of
a
living
death
and
that
alone
remained
impressed
on
my
mind
i
could
still
see
black
jeffries
sitting
on
the
bench
glaring
down
at
me
in
unconcealed
anger
his
eyes
blazing
with
the
fury
of
impotent
hate
as
he
roared
that
by
decree
of
the
king
my
sentence
to
be
hung
was
commuted
to
twenty
years
of
penal
servitude
beyond
seas
it
had
never
even
seemed
an
act
of
mercy
to
me
but
now
it
did
as
the
full
truth
suddenly
came
home
that
i
could
buy
my
freedom
god
what
a
relief
i
stood
up
straight
once
more
in
the
stature
of
a
man
i
hardly
know
what
wild
words
i
might
have
spoken
had
the
opportunity
been
mine
but
at
that
instant
the
figure
of
a
man
crossed
the
deck
toward
us
emerging
from
the
open
cabin
door
against
the
gleam
of
yellow
light
i
recognized
the
trim
form
advancing
and
as
instantly
stepped
back
into
shadow
my
quick
movement
caused
her
to
turn
and
face
him
what
he
exclaimed
and
evidently
surprised
at
his
discovery
it
is
indeed
mistress
dorothy
out
here
alone
was
my
thought
you
were
safely
in
your
cabin
long
since
but
prithee
i
mistake
you
are
not
alone
he
paused
slightly
irresolute
staring
forward
beyond
her
at
my
dimmer
outline
quite
uncertain
who
i
might
be
yet
already
suspicious
i
was
preparing
to
go
in
she
answered
ignoring
his
latter
words
the
night
already
looks
stormy
but
your
friend
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
was
insistent
almost
insolent
in
its
demand
and
she
hesitated
no
longer
in
meeting
the
challenge
your
pardon
i
am
sure
lieutenant
sanchez
this
gentleman
is
captain
geoffry
carlyle
he
stood
there
stiff
and
straight
against
the
background
of
light
one
hand
in
affected
carelessness
caressing
the
end
of
a
waxed
moustache
his
face
was
in
shadow
yet
i
was
quite
aware
of
the
flash
of
his
eyes
ah
indeed
some
passenger
i
have
not
chanced
to
observe
before
a
prisoner
she
returned
distinctly
you
may
perhaps
remember
my
uncle
pointed
him
out
to
us
when
he
first
came
aboard
and
you
have
been
out
here
alone
talking
with
the
fellow
certainly
why
not
why
the
man
is
a
felon
convicted
of
crime
sentenced
to
deportation
it
is
not
necessary
that
we
discuss
this
sir
she
interposed
rather
proudly
as
my
personal
conduct
is
not
a
matter
for
your
criticism
i
shall
retire
now
no
thank
you
you
need
not
come
he
stopped
still
staring
blankly
after
her
as
she
vanished
then
wheeled
about
to
vent
his
anger
on
me
carlyle
hey
he
exclaimed
sneeringly
a
familiar
sound
that
name
in
my
ears
one
of
the
brood
out
of
bucclough
a
cadet
of
that
line
i
managed
to
admit
wonderingly
you
know
of
them
quite
as
much
as
i
care
to
his
tone
ugly
and
insulting
then
an
idea
suddenly
occurred
to
his
mind
saint
guise
but
that
would
even
up
the
score
nicely
you
are
as
i
understand
it
sent
to
virginia
for
sale
yes
for
how
long
a
term
the
sentence
was
twenty
years
hela
and
you
go
to
the
highest
bidder
i
do
it
fellow
to
actually
own
a
carlyle
of
bucclough
will
be
a
sweet
revenge
you
mean
i
asked
dimly
grasping
his
purpose
that
you
propose
buying
me
when
we
reach
shore
why
not
a
most
excellent
plan
and
i
owe
it
all
to
a
brat
i
met
in
london
egad
it
will
be
some
joke
to
tell
when
next
i
visit
england
count
for
more
than
were
i
to
tweak
the
duke
nose
i
stopped
his
laughter
smiling
myself
grimly
in
the
darkness
a
very
noble
plan
for
revenge
i
admitted
enjoying
the
swift
of
his
game
and
one
which
i
am
not
likely
to
forget
unfortunately
you
come
too
late
it
happens
senor
that
i
am
already
safely
indentured
to
roger
fairfax
to
fairfax
she
told
you
that
who
told
me
can
make
no
difference
at
least
i
am
out
of
your
hands
i
turned
away
but
he
called
angrily
after
me
do
not
feel
so
sure
of
that
carlyle
i
am
in
the
game
yet
i
made
no
answer
already
despising
the
fellow
so
thoroughly
as
to
ignore
his
threat
he
still
stood
there
a
mere
shadow
as
i
disappeared
down
the
ladder
and
i
could
imagine
the
expression
on
his
face
chapter
iv
the
shores
of
virginia
i
rested
quietly
in
my
berth
for
a
long
time
staring
blankly
up
at
the
dark
deck
above
unable
to
sleep
and
endeavoring
to
figure
out
the
true
meaning
of
all
these
occurrences
it
began
to
rain
torrents
sweeping
the
planks
overhead
while
vivid
flashes
of
lightning
illumined
the
open
hatch
before
it
could
be
hastily
closed
revealing
the
squalidness
of
the
interior
in
which
we
were
quartered
then
someone
growling
and
stumbling
through
the
darkness
lit
a
slush
lantern
dangling
from
a
blackened
beam
its
faint
flicker
barely
discernible
the
hole
became
foul
and
sickening
men
tossing
and
groaning
in
their
uneasy
sleep
or
prowling
about
seeking
some
measure
of
comfort
there
was
no
severe
wind
accompanying
the
storm
and
the
flurry
of
rain
soon
swept
by
leaving
an
ugly
swell
behind
but
enabling
the
guard
to
again
uplift
the
hatches
immersed
as
i
was
in
thought
all
this
left
but
small
impress
on
me
i
felt
that
i
could
understand
the
interest
exhibited
by
dorothy
fairfax
and
greatly
as
i
already
admired
her
i
was
not
egotist
enough
to
even
imagine
that
her
effort
to
serve
me
had
basis
in
any
personal
attraction
my
connection
with
bucclough
coupled
with
her
uncle
report
of
my
conviction
had
very
naturally
aroused
the
sympathy
in
my
behalf
she
felt
a
desire
to
lighten
my
sorrows
as
much
as
possible
and
under
the
existing
circumstances
had
found
it
comparatively
easy
to
persuade
the
planter
to
acquiesce
in
her
suggestion
in
all
probability
he
really
had
need
of
my
services
and
was
therefore
glad
enough
of
this
opportunity
to
secure
them
this
part
of
the
affair
i
could
dismiss
without
giving
anyone
undue
credit
although
i
deeply
appreciated
the
kindness
of
heart
which
had
led
her
to
interpose
and
which
later
led
her
to
tell
me
so
quickly
what
had
occurred
her
purpose
however
was
fairly
clear
but
what
about
lieutenant
sanchez
why
was
this
unknown
spaniard
already
so
openly
my
enemy
there
was
no
doubting
his
position
and
there
surely
must
be
some
reason
for
it
outside
of
anything
which
had
occurred
on
board
the
his
words
had
given
me
some
inkling
of
the
cause
a
past
quarrel
with
the
duke
of
bucclough
in
england
in
which
he
must
have
been
worsted
and
which
had
left
in
his
mind
a
lurking
desire
for
revenge
he
dreamed
of
striking
his
enemy
through
me
because
of
relationship
a
cowardly
blow
yet
this
by
itself
alone
was
scarcely
a
reason
why
he
should
have
thus
sought
me
out
for
a
victim
no
sane
man
would
deliberately
visit
the
sins
of
my
brother
on
me
nor
had
this
been
deliberate
it
was
the
mere
outburst
of
sudden
passion
arising
through
my
intercourse
with
the
young
woman
otherwise
it
might
never
have
occurred
to
him
so
there
was
seemingly
but
one
answer
sanchez
used
this
merely
as
an
excuse
for
the
concealment
of
his
real
object
what
could
that
object
be
could
it
be
dorothy
fairfax
i
was
a
long
while
in
actually
convincing
myself
of
this
probability
and
yet
no
other
satisfactory
explanation
offered
itself
she
had
exhibited
an
interest
in
me
from
the
very
first
and
he
had
endeavored
to
win
her
attention
elsewhere
even
that
day
when
we
first
came
aboard
in
chains
he
had
plainly
evinced
this
desire
and
since
then
the
girl
had
never
appeared
on
deck
without
his
immediately
seeking
her
company
i
felt
finally
that
i
had
the
clue
jealousy
the
mad
unreasoning
jealousy
of
his
race
he
fiercely
resented
her
slightest
interest
in
anyone
even
a
prisoner
as
against
his
own
attractions
he
was
incapable
of
appreciating
friendly
sympathy
and
already
held
me
a
dangerous
rival
then
possibly
it
had
not
been
a
mere
idle
desire
to
visit
the
colonies
which
had
originally
led
to
his
prompt
acceptance
of
roger
fairfax
invitation
to
make
one
of
their
party
the
real
attraction
was
the
charms
of
dorothy
her
girlish
beauty
coupled
no
doubt
with
her
wealth
the
fellow
was
in
love
impetuously
in
love
resenting
blindly
the
slightest
advance
of
any
other
the
thought
rather
pleased
me
largely
because
of
its
absurdity
it
was
in
my
case
at
least
so
utterly
false
and
unjustifiable
to
the
ordinary
mind
indeed
any
such
connection
would
be
practically
unthinkable
even
had
i
been
wild
enough
to
dream
of
such
a
thing
the
gulf
existing
between
myself
and
dorothy
fairfax
was
far
too
deep
and
wide
ever
to
be
spanned
i
had
before
me
twenty
years
of
servitude
and
an
unknown
future
nor
could
i
even
conceive
the
possibility
of
any
such
thought
ever
entering
her
mind
the
very
opposite
was
what
gave
her
courage
to
serve
me
i
had
no
false
conception
as
to
this
no
vagrant
thought
that
her
interest
in
me
was
any
more
than
a
passing
fancy
born
of
sympathy
and
a
desire
to
aid
nevertheless
as
she
had
thus
already
served
me
i
now
owed
her
service
in
return
and
here
was
the
first
call
if
conditions
made
it
possible
it
was
my
plain
duty
to
place
myself
between
these
two
i
felt
no
hatred
toward
the
man
no
desire
to
do
him
a
personal
injury
but
i
did
dislike
and
distrust
him
this
feeling
was
instinctive
and
without
the
slightest
reference
to
his
seeking
intimacy
with
the
girl
from
the
first
moment
i
had
looked
upon
his
face
there
had
been
antagonism
between
us
a
feeling
of
enmity
whether
this
arose
from
his
appearance
or
actions
i
could
not
determine
but
the
fellow
was
not
my
kind
in
the
intensity
of
my
feelings
i
must
have
unconsciously
spoken
aloud
for
a
shaggy
head
suddenly
popped
out
from
the
berth
beneath
where
i
lay
and
an
interested
voice
asked
solicitously
hy
thar
whut
up
mate
sick
agin
no
i
answered
grinning
rather
guiltily
just
thinking
and
letting
loose
a
bit
did
i
disturb
you
well
i
reckon
i
exactly
asleep
he
acknowledged
without
withdrawing
his
head
ye
wus
mutterin
thar
an
not
me
none
till
ye
got
ter
talkin
sum
feller
called
sanchez
then
i
sorter
got
a
bit
interested
i
know
thet
cuss
onct
and
he
spat
as
though
to
thus
better
express
his
feelings
the
damned
ornary
pirate
i
laughed
my
whole
mental
mood
changed
by
this
remark
it
is
not
very
likely
we
have
the
same
party
in
mind
haley
you
see
sanchez
is
a
decidedly
common
name
among
spaniards
i
known
two
or
three
of
that
name
myself
you
were
not
referring
to
anyone
on
board
were
you
i
sure
hope
not
he
scratched
his
head
staring
up
at
me
through
the
dim
light
wakefulness
encouraging
him
to
talk
they
tell
me
ye
are
a
man
well
i
wus
a
deal
fisher
but
hev
made
a
half
dozen
thet
how
i
hed
the
damn
luck
ter
meet
up
with
this
sanchez
i
was
a
speakin
he
the
only
one
ever
i
know
i
met
up
with
him
off
the
isle
o
cuba
likely
ye
know
the
devil
i
mean
the
question
served
to
center
my
memory
suddenly
on
a
dim
remembrance
of
the
past
no
unless
you
refer
to
sanchez
i
heard
of
him
were
you
ever
in
his
hands
wus
i
he
laughed
grimly
i
hed
eight
months
of
it
mate
and
a
greater
demon
never
sailed
the
things
i
saw
done
ye
never
believe

but
later
you

recollection
but
i

months
fer
the
luck

as
i
wus
so
long
about
midnight
i
got
ter
talk
with
all
these
fellers
an
when
lagrasse
went
down
below
ter
take
a
snooze
in
the
cabin
we
hoisted
them
dutchmen
on
deck

a
couple
overboard

just
naturally
took
control
the
mate

a
dead
nigger
afore
he
ever
knew
whut
wus
up
when
daylight
come
we
wus
streakin
it
eastward
by
compass
an
every
damn
sail
set
thet
wus
the
easiest
part
of
it
them
dutchmen
could
talk
nuthin
but
their
own
lingo
an
thar
a
navigator
aboard
fer
sanchez
hed
kept
all
the
offercers
with
him
an
the
end
wus
about
a
week
later
when
we
piled
up
against
an
island
off
the
african
coast
an
only
one
boat
load
of
us
got
ashore
thet
whut
i
know
about
sanchez
i
had
a
shipmate
once
i
observed
interested
in
his
story
who
claimed
to
have
seen
the
fellow
he
described
him
as
being
a
very
large
man
with
intensely
black
hawklike
eyes
and
a
heavy
black
beard
almost
hiding
his
face
haley
laughed
maybe
he
looked
like
that
when
he
saw
him
but
he
ai
no
bigger
man
than
i
am
he
wo
weigh
as
much
by
fifteen
pound
fact
is
he
mighty
seldom
looks
the
same
fer
thet
part
o
his
game
them
whiskers
is
false
an
so
is
the
saller
look
to
his
face
i
seen
him
in
all
sorts
o
disguises
it
only
his
eyes
he
ca
hide
an
thar
been
times
when
i
thought
they
wus
the
ugliest
eyes
ever
i
saw
he
sure
an
ornary
devil
an
when
he
gits
mad
i
rather
be
afront
of
a
tiger
besides
fightin
his
trade
an
no
weaklin
ai
goin
ter
control
the
sort
o
chaps
he
got
ter
handle
most
of
would
murder
him
in
a
minute
if
they
dared
oh
he
bad
all
right
but
yer
would
exactly
think
so
just
ter
look
at
him
i
run
up
agin
a
lot
o
different
men
in
my
time
thet
i
naturally
sheer
off
from
a
blame
sight
quicker
than
i
would
from
him
you
mean
that
when
he
is
not
in
disguise
he
does
not
appear
dangerous
what
then
does
he
really
look
like
haley
spat
again
onto
the
deck
and
scratched
his
shock
of
hair
as
though
thus
to
stimulate
his
memory
oh
a
sorter
spanish
don
the
kind
whut
likes
ter
dress
up
an
play
the
dandy
he
got
a
pink
an
white
complexion
the
castilian
kind
yer
know
an
wears
a
little
moustache
waxed
up
at
the
ends
he
about
two
inches
taller
than
i
am
with
no
extra
flesh
but
with
a
hell
of
a
grip
in
his
hands
as
i
said
afore
if
it
fer
his
eyes
nobody
ever
look
at
him
twice
all
his
devilishness
shows
thar
an
i
seen
laugh
like
he
did
have
a
care
on
earth
how
old
a
man
is
he
how
old
is
the
devil
i
heard
he
wus
about
i
reckon
he
must
be
thet
but
he
do
look
older
than
thirty
he
ai
the
kind
yer
can
guess
at
we
talked
together
for
quite
a
while
longer
our
conversation
gradually
drifting
to
the
recounting
of
various
sea
adventures
and
my
thoughts
did
not
again
recur
to
sanchez
until
after
i
rested
back
once
more
in
my
berth
endeavoring
to
fall
asleep
haley
must
have
dropped
off
immediately
for
i
could
distinguish
his
heavy
breathing
among
the
others
but
my
mind
continued
to
wander
until
it
conjured
up
once
again
this
west
india
pirate
his
name
and
the
story
of
his
exploits
had
been
familiar
to
me
ever
since
i
first
went
to
sea
while
only
one
among
many
operating
in
those
haunted
waters
his
resourcefulness
daring
and
cruelty
had
won
him
an
infamous
reputation
a
name
of
horror
in
those
days
when
the
curse
of
piracy
made
the
sea
a
terror
no
ordinary
man
could
ever
have
succeeded
in
attaining
such
supremacy
in
crime
no
doubt
much
that
had
been
reported
was
either
false
or
exaggerated
yet
there
flashed
across
my
memory
numberless
tales
of
rapine
outrage
and
cruelty
in
which
this
demon
of
the
sea
had
figured
causing
me
to
shudder
at
the
recollection
to
my
mind
he
had
long
been
a
fiend
incarnate
his
name
a
horror
on
the
lips
black
sanchez
and
haley
pictured
him
as
a
dandified
ordinary
appearing
individual
with
white
and
red
complexion
a
small
moustache
and
flashing
dark
eyes
a
mere
spanish
gallant
without
special
distinction
why
that
description
strangely
enough
fitted
almost
exactly
this
fellow
on
board
this
other
sanchez
i
leaned
over
the
edge
of
my
bunk
and
looked
down
on
haley
half
resolved
to
ask
if
he
had
ever
noticed
this
lieutenant
but
the
man
was
already
sound
asleep
the
suspicion
which
had
crept
into
my
mind
was
so
absurd
so
unspeakably
silly
and
impossible
that
i
laughed
at
myself
and
dismissed
the
crazy
thought
what
that
fellow
black
sanchez
bah
no
he
had
been
at
sea
of
course
there
was
no
denying
that
fact
for
he
knew
ships
and
spoke
the
lingo
of
blue
water
but
the
very
idea
that
that
buccaneer
whose
hated
name
was
on
the
lips
of
every
man
of
britain
would
ever
dare
openly
to
visit
england
and
then
sail
under
his
own
name
on
board
an
english
vessel
for
virginia
was
too
preposterous
for
consideration
why
it
would
be
sheer
madness
the
knowledge
that
such
a
possibility
ever
had
flashed
into
my
mind
became
amusing
and
chuckling
over
it
i
finally
fell
asleep
it
was
noon
the
sky
overcast
the
wind
blowing
strong
from
the
southeast
when
the
virginia
coast
was
first
sighted
from
our
an
hour
later
it
became
plainly
visible
from
the
deck
below
and
the
prisoners
were
routed
out
from
their
quarters
and
the
shackles
removed
from
limbs
when
we
first
arrived
on
board
were
again
riveted
in
place
binding
them
together
in
fours
preparatory
to
landing
i
with
one
or
two
others
already
disposed
of
and
in
control
of
masters
were
spared
this
indignity
and
permitted
to
move
about
as
we
pleased
within
the
narrow
deck
space
reserved
for
our
use
the
last
meal
was
served
in
the
open
the
men
squatting
on
the
deck
planks
endeavoring
to
jest
among
themselves
and
assuming
a
cheerfulness
they
were
very
far
from
feeling
the
long
hardships
of
the
voyage
had
left
indelible
marks
on
the
majority
and
they
were
by
now
a
miserable
lot
who
had
largely
abandoned
themselves
to
despair
the
monmouth
campaign
had
been
brief
but
no
less
disastrous
to
the
men
engaged
in
it
those
who
survived
the
one
battle
wounded
and
fugitive
had
been
hunted
down
remorselessly
like
so
many
wild
beasts
escape
from
the
pursuit
of
soldiers
was
almost
impossible
and
they
had
been
brutally
beaten
and
bruised
by
infuriated
captors
and
then
uncared
for
nor
shown
the
slightest
mercy
had
been
thrust
into
loathsome
gaols
to
helplessly
await
trial
and
a
certain
conviction
no
pen
could
adequately
describe
the
suffering
and
horror
of
those
months
of
waiting
while
the
unfortunate
victims
lived
in
crowded
dirty
cells
subjected
to
every
conceivable
indignity
and
insult
from
brutal
guards
half
starved
and
breathing
foul
fetid
air
the
breath
of
sickness
the
stench
of
unclean
wounds
dragged
forth
at
last
one
by
one
into
a
court
organized
for
condemnation
presided
over
by
a
brute
whose
every
word
was
insult
denied
all
opportunity
for
defense
they
had
later
been
shackled
together
as
felons
and
driven
aboard
ship
like
so
many
head
of
cattle
herded
below
deck
tossed
about
for
weeks
on
a
stormy
sea
uncared
for
and
half
starved
scarcely
realizing
their
destination
or
knowing
their
fate
seeing
their
dead
dragged
out
from
their
midst
with
each
dawn
and
flung
carelessly
overboard
cursed
at
and
struck
by
their
guards
they
now
dragged
their
aching
bodies
about
in
half
dead
despair
the
chains
clanking
to
every
movement
of
the
limbs
their
dull
lackluster
eyes
scarcely
discerning
the
darkening
line
of
coast
toward
which
the
steered
with
what
depth
of
pity
i
looked
at
them
my
glance
gladly
straying
from
their
downcast
faces
toward
the
group
of
passengers
gathered
eagerly
along
the
poop
rail
to
welcome
joyfully
the
approach
of
land
these
were
all
animation
excitement
talking
eagerly
to
each
other
and
pointing
out
familiar
headlands
as
they
emerged
through
the
thin
mists
their
thoughts
were
all
centered
on
home
or
the
promises
of
this
new
land
they
were
approaching
and
so
deeply
interested
that
scarcely
an
eye
turned
toward
those
miserable
wretches
grouped
on
the
forward
deck
being
borne
into
slavery
and
disgrace
it
was
a
contrast
between
hope
and
despair
as
these
passengers
moved
restlessly
back
and
forth
from
rail
to
rail
i
easily
recognized
among
them
every
face
grown
familiar
to
me
during
the
course
of
the
voyage
excepting
the
two
i
most
eagerly
sought
and
became
convinced
that
neither
roger
fairfax
nor
his
niece
had
yet
come
upon
deck
sanchez
was
there
however
standing
alone
and
silent
seldom
lifting
his
eyes
to
the
changing
view
ahead
but
apparently
buried
in
his
own
thoughts
once
our
glances
accidentally
met
and
i
could
but
observe
the
sudden
change
in
the
man
expression
a
change
sinister
and
full
of
threat
whatever
the
original
cause
might
be
his
personal
feeling
toward
me
was
undoubtedly
bitter
and
unforgiving
and
he
possessed
no
wish
to
disguise
it
the
new
life
in
the
new
world
had
already
brought
me
both
friend
and
enemy
before
i
had
as
yet
touched
foot
on
land
chapter
v
the
waters
of
the
chesapeake
the
brig
with
all
sails
set
and
favored
by
a
strong
wind
drew
rapidly
in
toward
the
point
of
landing
the
great
majority
of
the
prisoners
remained
on
deck
chained
together
and
helpless
yet
surrounded
by
armed
guards
while
the
few
who
had
already
been
purchased
by
passengers
humbly
followed
their
new
masters
ashore
the
moment
the
touched
the
soil
of
virginia
there
were
five
of
us
altogether
thus
favored
but
i
was
the
only
one
owing
allegiance
to
roger
fairfax
the
rude
landing
wharf
along
which
we
lay
was
already
densely
crowded
with
men
their
appearance
and
dress
largely
proclaiming
them
to
be
planters
from
the
interior
either
gathered
to
inspect
the
consignment
of
prisoners
or
eager
to
purchase
at
low
prices
the
stores
hidden
away
in
the
vessel
hold
some
among
the
concourse
however
were
undoubtedly
present
to
welcome
friends
and
relatives
among
the
passengers
altogether
it
was
a
bustling
scene
full
of
change
and
color
the
air
noisy
with
shouting
voices
the
line
of
wharves
filled
with
a
number
of
vessels
either
newly
arrived
or
preparing
to
depart
servants
both
white
and
colored
were
busily
at
work
under
the
command
of
overseers
loading
and
unloading
cargoes
while
the
high
bank
beyond
was
crowded
with
vehicles
of
various
kinds
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
had
evidently
spread
widely
together
with
the
rumor
that
she
brought
a
number
of
prisoners
to
be
auctioned
off
it
was
a
restless
crowd
especially
anxious
for
any
news
from
abroad
and
eager
to
benefit
from
the
sale
the
majority
of
the
men
i
judged
to
be
landowners
hearty
wholesome
looking
fellows
whose
lives
were
passed
dressed
in
their
best
in
honor
of
the
occasion
the
prevailing
fashion
was
a
felt
hat
with
one
side
looped
up
to
the
crown
by
a
brilliant
metal
button
a
velvet
coat
with
long
voluminous
skirts
wide
sleeves
metallic
buttons
as
large
as
a
spanish
dollar
short
breeches
and
long
stockings
with
gold
or
silver
knee
and
shoe
buckles
many
wore
swords
while
those
who
did
not
bore
about
with
them
enormous
gold
or
canes
the
smoking
of
pipes
was
common
and
thoughtless
profanity
was
to
be
heard
on
all
sides
as
an
ordinary
part
of
speech
it
was
with
no
small
difficulty
we
succeeded
in
forcing
our
way
through
this
jostling
throng
until
we
attained
to
an
open
space
ashore
i
followed
closely
behind
the
three
composing
our
party
roger
fairfax
and
sanchez
with
the
laughing
girl
between
them
for
protection
pressing
a
passage
forward
even
had
i
not
been
laden
with
packages
my
general
appearance
and
dress
would
doubtless
have
proclaimed
my
position
and
aroused
passing
interest
i
heard
voices
calling
attention
to
me
while
curious
eyes
stared
into
my
face
fairfax
was
evidently
well
known
to
a
number
present
for
he
was
being
greeted
on
all
sides
with
hearty
and
words
of
welcome
ah
back
again
roger
and
what
fortune
in
london
a
fair
price
for
the
crop
is
the
lad
trailing
behind
ye
one
o
monmouth
men
any
news
friend
in
parliament
what
is
the
latest
on
the
tax
and
pray
who
is
this
damsel
roger
not
hugh
fairfax
girl
ay
quite
the
woman
now
your
men
they
over
there
across
the
road
of
course
i
know
did
i
not
come
from
the
dock
with
them
there
were
two
of
them
both
negroes
but
one
addressed
by
fairfax
as
sam
was
much
the
lighter
in
color
and
far
more
intelligent
of
face
a
few
words
of
instruction
dispatched
these
back
to
the
for
the
luggage
yet
remaining
on
board
while
our
own
party
continued
to
advance
along
the
water
front
toward
where
sam
had
designated
the
fairfax
boat
would
be
found
awaiting
us
fully
prepared
to
depart
up
the
chesapeake
when
finally
attained
this
vessel
proved
to
be
a
goodly
sized
sloop
of
a
type
familiar
to
those
waters
containing
a
comfortable
small
cabin
forward
a
staunch
craft
but
with
lines
indicating
sailing
qualities
while
requiring
only
a
small
crew
several
similar
vessels
doubtless
owned
and
operated
by
planters
residing
along
the
shore
of
the
bay
were
anchored
in
the
basin
or
fastened
at
the
dock
but
the
had
been
warped
in
against
the
bank
which
at
this
point
was
high
enough
to
enable
us
easily
to
step
aboard
over
the
low
rail
a
dingy
looking
white
man
quite
evidently
from
his
appearance
an
indentured
servant
was
in
charge
he
greeted
us
rather
surlily
staring
at
me
with
almost
open
hostility
yet
responded
swiftly
enough
to
orders
here
carr
stow
these
packages
away
yes
you
better
help
with
them
carlyle
the
other
bags
will
be
along
directly
sam
and
john
have
gone
after
them
put
these
forward
under
cover
has
everything
been
seen
to
so
we
can
start
at
once
ay
ay
sorr
was
the
gruff
response
in
a
strong
irish
brogue
lord
knows
we
hid
toime
enough
fer
we
bin
waitin
here
fer
yer
a
wake
er
more
it
a
month
since
the
lether
came
we
have
had
a
slow
voyage
carr
so
all
i
ordered
is
aboard
she
full
oop
ter
the
hatches
bedad
i
hope
thar
ai
no
more
good
we
ought
to
get
as
far
as
travers
by
dark
then
hurry
along
and
stow
that
stuff
away
here
come
the
others
now
the
three
found
comfortable
seats
along
the
opposite
rail
and
sat
there
watching
us
hastily
bring
aboard
the
various
articles
which
the
two
negroes
assisted
by
a
boy
and
a
cart
had
transported
from
the
brig
i
worked
along
with
the
others
under
the
orders
of
sam
who
seemed
to
be
in
charge
already
feeling
somewhat
deeply
the
humiliation
of
my
position
but
nevertheless
realizing
the
necessity
of
prompt
obedience
the
knowledge
that
i
was
now
a
slave
on
a
level
with
these
others
compelled
to
perform
menial
labor
under
the
very
eyes
of
dorothy
fairfax
and
that
sneering
spaniard
cut
my
pride
to
the
quick
in
my
trips
back
and
forth
i
kept
my
eyes
averted
never
once
venturing
to
glance
toward
them
until
this
work
had
been
accomplished
but
when
we
stood
idle
while
sam
went
aft
for
instructions
i
had
recovered
sufficient
nerve
to
turn
my
eyes
in
that
direction
only
to
observe
that
the
young
woman
sat
with
head
turned
away
gazing
out
over
the
rail
at
the
shore
her
chin
cupped
in
her
hands
her
thoughts
apparently
far
away
strange
as
it
may
seem
her
obvious
indifference
hurt
me
oddly
my
only
comprehension
being
that
she
did
not
in
the
least
care
that
in
fact
she
had
already
entirely
dismissed
me
from
her
mind
this
supposition
whether
true
or
false
instantly
hardened
me
to
my
fate
and
i
stared
at
sanchez
meeting
his
eyes
fairly
at
once
angered
by
the
sneer
on
his
lips
and
the
open
insult
of
his
manner
he
turned
toward
her
fingering
a
cheroot
and
said
something
but
though
she
answered
her
head
remained
motionless
her
eyes
searching
the
shore
indifferently
a
figure
or
two
appeared
along
the
summit
of
the
bank
voices
calling
to
fairfax
who
stood
up
as
he
replied
ending
the
conversation
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
to
sam
who
had
taken
position
at
the
wheel
the
latter
began
shouting
orders
in
a
shrill
voice
carr
cast
off
and
with
the
negro
and
myself
at
the
halliards
the
mainsail
rose
to
the
caps
while
we
began
gliding
out
from
the
shore
into
the
deeper
water
by
the
time
we
had
hoisted
the
jib
and
made
all
secure
we
were
out
far
enough
to
feel
the
full
force
of
the
stiff
breeze
the
careening
until
her
rail
was
awash
the
white
canvas
soaring
above
us
against
the
misty
blue
of
the
sky
there
was
little
to
be
done
after
the
ropes
had
been
coiled
away
and
we
were
fairly
out
into
the
broader
reaches
of
the
bay
the
wind
held
steady
requiring
no
shifting
of
canvas
so
sam
having
dispatched
the
negro
below
to
prepare
lunch
and
stationed
carr
forward
as
lookout
called
me
aft
to
the
wheel
he
was
a
rather
fellow
yellow
as
saffron
with
rings
in
his
ears
and
a
wide
mouth
perpetually
grinning
massa
fairfax
he
say
you
real
sailorman
he
began
looking
me
over
carefully
with
a
nod
of
his
head
toward
the
group
at
the
rail
dat
so
yes
i
have
been
a
number
of
years
at
sea
dat
what
he
say

try
right
now
yer
take
hol
while
ah
stand
by
a
bit
i
took
his
place
grasping
the
spokes
firmly
and
he
stood
aside
watching
every
movement
closely
as
i
held
the
speeding
sloop
steadily
up
to
the
wind
the
spray
pouring
in
over
the
dipping
rail
forward
the
grin
on
his
lips
broadened
what
is
the
course
i
asked
curiously
ter
dat
point
yonder
see
whar
de
lone
tree
stan
we
done
dat
tree
hunder
yards
out
an
then

he
burst
into
a
guffaw
as
though
the
question
was
a
rare
joke
no
sah
i
nebber
done
saw
one
but
surely
you
must
steer
by
compass

west
shore

sloop

he
nodded
still
grinning
cheerfully
over
the
ease
with
which
i
manipulated
the
wheel
chuck
full
ter
de

quite
a
spell
ah
be
back
afore
yer
de
point
yonder
i
was
alone
at
the
wheel
the
sloop
in
my
control
and
somehow
as
i
stood
there
grasping
those
spokes
the
swift
boat
leaping
forward
through
the
water
leaning
recklessly
over
before
the
force
of
the
wind
the
numbing
sense
of
helpless
servitude
left
me
in
a
new
return
of
manhood
and
responsibility
it
was
a
scene
of
exhilaration
the
sun
still
partially
obscured
by
misty
clouds
already
well
down
in
the
western
sky
with
the
tossing
waves
of
the
bay
the
distant
headlands
appeared
spectral
and
gray
through
the
vapor
while
the
waters
beyond
took
on
the
tint
of
purple
shadows
the
responded
to
the
helm
gallantly
the
spreading
canvas
above
standing
out
like
a
board
a
broad
wake
of
white
foam
spreading
far
astern
not
another
sail
appeared
across
that
troubled
surface
of
waters
not
even
a
fisherman
boat
the
only
other
vessel
visible
along
our
course
being
a
dim
outline
close
in
against
that
headland
toward
which
i
had
been
instructed
to
steer
i
stared
at
this
indistinct
object
at
first
believing
it
a
wreck
but
finally
distinguishing
the
bare
masts
of
a
bark
evidently
riding
at
anchor
only
a
few
hundred
yards
off
shore
satisfied
as
to
this
my
glance
shifted
to
our
own
decks
feeling
a
seaman
admiration
for
the
cleanliness
of
the
little
vessel
and
the
shipshape
condition
of
everything
aboard
the
decks
had
more
the
appearance
of
a
pleasure
yacht
than
that
of
a
cargo
carrier
although
the
broad
beam
and
commodious
hatches
bespoke
ample
storage
room
below
apparently
all
this
hold
space
had
been
reserved
for
the
transportation
of
goods
the
passenger
quarters
being
forward
with
the
cook
galley
at
the
foot
of
the
mast
where
the
crew
slept
i
was
unable
to
discern
but
they
were
few
in
number
and
as
sam
had
disappeared
up
a
short
ladder
and
then
across
the
roof
of
the
cabin
it
was
highly
probable
there
would
be
a
compact
forecastle
nestled
between
the
bows
the
blacker
negro
was
busily
engaged
in
the
galley
his
figure
occasionally
visible
at
the
open
door
and
a
column
of
black
smoke
poured
out
through
the
tin
funnel
the
deck
planks
were
scrubbed
white
and
the
had
been
polished
until
they
shone
the
three
passengers
still
remained
seated
together
the
men
conversing
and
occasionally
pointing
forth
at
some
object
across
the
water
but
while
i
watched
the
little
group
the
girl
made
no
movement
nor
attempt
at
speech
none
of
them
even
so
much
as
glanced
toward
me
and
i
felt
that
already
i
had
been
dismissed
from
their
thought
had
been
relegated
to
my
proper
position
had
sunken
to
my
future
place
as
a
mere
servant
finally
mistress
dorothy
arose
to
her
feet
and
with
a
brief
word
of
explanation
to
her
uncle
started
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
cabin
a
sudden
leap
of
the
boat
caused
her
to
clutch
the
rail
and
instantly
sanchez
was
at
her
side
proffering
assistance
they
crossed
the
dancing
deck
together
his
hand
upon
her
arm
and
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
door
to
exchange
a
few
sentences
when
the
spaniard
came
back
he
pointed
out
to
fairfax
the
position
of
the
still
distant
bark
which
however
was
by
this
time
plainly
revealed
off
our
port
quarter
the
planter
stood
up
in
order
to
see
better
and
then
the
two
crossed
the
deck
to
a
position
only
a
few
yards
from
where
i
stood
at
the
wheel
and
remained
there
staring
out
across
the
intervening
water
surely
a
strange
place
in
which
to
anchor
lieutenant
said
fairfax
at
last
breaking
the
silence
his
hand
shading
his
eyes
bark
rigged
and
very
heavily
sparred
seems
to
be
all
right
what
do
you
make
of
the
vessel
the
spaniard
twisted
his
moustache
but
exhibited
little
interest
although
his
gaze
was
upon
the
craft
decidedly
dutch
i
should
say
he
answered
slowly
to
judge
from
the
shape
of
her
lines
and
the
size
of
her
spars
the
beggars
seem
quite
at
home
there
with
all
their
washing
out
not
a
usual
anchorage
no
nor
a
particularly
safe
one
there
are
some
very
heavy
seas
off
that
point
at
times
and
there
is
no
plantation
near
by
place
is
beyond
the
bend
we
put
up
with
him
tonight
he
owns
that
land
yonder
but
his
wharf
is
several
miles
up
the
coast
damn
me
sanchez
i
believe
i
hail
the
fellow
and
find
out
what
he
is
doing
in
there
sanchez
nodded
carelessly
striking
flint
and
steel
in
an
effort
to
relight
a
cheroot
and
fairfax
turned
his
head
toward
me
oh
is
that
you
carlyle
where
is
sam
gone
forward
sir
half
an
hour
ago
he
decided
i
was
safe
the
planter
laughed
with
a
side
glance
toward
sanchez
who
gave
no
sign
that
he
overhead
no
doubt
he
was
right
port
your
helm
a
little
and
run
down
as
close
as
seems
safe
to
that
fellow
out
yonder
until
i
hail
him
very
well
sir
we
came
about
slowly
tossed
a
bit
by
the
heavy
swell
the
ponderous
boom
swinging
and
permitting
the
loosened
canvas
to
flap
against
the
ropes
until
the
sloop
finally
steadied
onto
the
new
tack
the
distance
to
be
covered
was
not
great
and
in
less
than
ten
minutes
we
were
drawing
in
toward
the
high
stern
of
the
anchored
vessel
she
was
larger
than
i
had
thought
a
lumping
craft
for
those
days
bark
rigged
with
lower
spars
the
heaviest
i
had
ever
seen
no
evidence
of
life
appeared
on
board
although
everything
looked
shipshape
alow
and
aloft
and
a
rather
extensive
wash
flapped
in
the
wind
forward
bespeaking
a
generous
crew
there
was
no
flag
at
the
mizzen
to
signify
nationality
yet
there
was
a
peculiar
touch
to
the
rig
which
confirmed
in
my
mind
the
truth
of
sanchez
guess
that
she
was
originally
dutch
a
moment
later
this
supposition
was
confirmed
as
my
eyes
made
out
the
name
painted
across
the
stern
namur
of
rotterdam
fairfax
leaned
far
out
across
the
rail
as
we
swept
in
closer
his
eyes
searching
the
stranger
side
for
some
evidence
of
human
presence
aboard
but
the
spaniard
exhibited
no
particular
interest
in
the
proceedings
standing
motionless
the
smoke
of
the
cheroot
blown
idly
from
his
mouth
the
fellow
face
was
turned
from
me
yet
i
could
not
help
note
the
insolence
of
his
attitude
in
spite
of
my
occupation
at
the
wheel
a
hundred
feet
distant
i
held
the
dancing
sloop
to
mere
while
fairfax
hailed
in
a
voice
which
went
roaring
across
the
water
like
a
gun
ahoy
the
bark
a
man
with
a
black
beard
thrust
his
head
up
above
the
after
rail
and
answered
using
english
yet
with
a
faint
accent
which
was
not
dutch
what
he
looked
like
below
the
shoulders
could
not
be
discerned
veil
vat
vanted
vos
anyding
wrong
no
not
aboard
here
returned
fairfax
a
bit
puzzled
at
the
reply
we
ran
down
to
see
if
you
were
in
any
trouble
this
is
a
strange
place
to
anchor
what
are
you
dutch
the
fellow
waved
his
hands
in
a
gesture
indicating
disgust
eet

but

he
explained
brokenly
wiz
an

for
our

but
why

in
a
place
like
this
why
not

in
spite
of
my
efforts
the
two
vessels
were
drifting
rapidly
apart
and
this
last
explanation
came
to
us
over
the
water
in
a
faint
thread
of
sound
barely
discernible
i
asked
if
i
should
tack
back
but
fairfax
shook
his
head
and
in
a
moment
more
we
were
beyond
reach
of
the
voice
dorothy
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
cabin
and
stood
there
gazing
in
surprise
at
the
bark
while
the
moment
he
caught
sight
of
her
sanchez
went
hastily
forward
removing
his
hat
with
so
peculiar
a
flourish
as
he
approached
as
to
cause
me
to
notice
the
gesture
fairfax
remained
beside
the
rail
staring
out
across
the
widening
water
clearly
dissatisfied
but
finally
waved
his
hand
in
a
command
to
me
to
resume
our
course
shortly
after
he
crossed
the
deck
to
the
wheel
and
stood
there
beside
me
still
watchful
of
the
dwindling
vessel
already
far
astern
what
do
you
make
of
her
carlyle
he
asked
finally
turning
slightly
to
glance
at
my
face
i
believe
that
fellow
lied
so
do
i
sir
i
answered
promptly
whatever
else
he
may
be
no
peaceful
dutch
trader
the
bark
is
dutch
built
all
right
and
no
doubt
once
sailed
out
of
rotterdam
but
that
fellow
got
his
accent
from
south
europe
damn
me
that
just
what
i
thought
nor
is
that
all
sir
if
he
was
loaded
with
and
hides
for
market
he
would
be
nearly
so
high
out
of
water
that
bark
was
in
ballast
or
i
miss
my
guess
besides
if
he
was
a
trader
where
was
his
crew
there
was
a
single
head
popped
over
the
rail
while
we
were
alongside
and
that
is
natural
even
a
west
india
nigger
has
curiosity
i
tell
you
the
men
on
board
that
hooker
had
orders
to
keep
down
fairfax
stroked
his
chin
his
eyes
shifting
from
the
distant
vessel
to
dorothy
and
sanchez
who
were
now
making
their
way
slowly
aft
the
latter
grasping
the
girl
arm
and
smirking
as
he
talked
rapidly
by
god
but
i
believe
you
are
right
he
admitted
frankly
although
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
there
is
something
wrong
there
tell
travers
and
have
him
send
a
runner
overland
to
give
warning
below
chapter
vi
fairfax
speaks
with
me
sanchez
drew
a
chair
into
the
slight
shade
cast
by
the
mainsail
and
induced
his
reluctant
companion
to
sit
down
he
remained
bending
over
her
with
his
back
turned
toward
us
chattering
away
although
she
only
answered
in
monosyllables
seldom
glancing
up
into
his
face
with
hands
gripping
the
spokes
of
the
wheel
and
my
attention
concentrated
on
the
course
ahead
i
could
yet
notice
how
closely
fairfax
was
observing
the
two
with
no
pleasant
expression
in
his
eyes
and
forgetful
that
i
was
merely
a
servant
i
ventured
a
question
you
have
known
senor
sanchez
for
some
time
sir
he
started
in
surprise
yet
answered
as
though
the
unexpected
query
had
been
merely
an
echo
of
his
own
thoughts
no
he
admitted
frankly
indeed
i
hardly
know
how
it
happened
that
i
invited
him
to
join
our
party
it
seemed
natural
enough
then
but
lately
i
confess
to
having
taken
a
dislike
to
the
fellow
and
have
begun
to
imagine
that
he
even
pushed
his
way
on
me
but
he
stopped
suddenly
realizing
what
he
was
saying
why
do
you
ask
i
was
not
wholly
prepared
to
say
yet
as
instantly
comprehended
the
prompt
necessity
of
advancing
some
reasonable
explanation
there
came
to
me
swiftly
from
the
sharpness
of
his
question
the
paralyzing
knowledge
that
i
was
a
servant
addressing
my
master
of
course
it
is
no
business
of
mine
i
confessed
rather
lamely
who
your
guests
are
i
sorry
i
spoke
it
is
altogether
too
late
to
say
that
he
insisted
some
thought
prompted
the
inquiry
go
on
see
here
carlyle
you
are
no
nigger
or
white
thief
i
know
the
difference
and
recognize
that
you
are
gentleman
born
because
i
bought
your
services
for
a
term
of
years
is
no
reason
why
you
can
not
talk
to
me
like
a
man
do
you
know
anything
about
this
spaniard
not
very
much
sir
he
has
seen
fit
to
threaten
me
on
account
of
some
row
he
has
had
with
a
brother
of
mine
in
england
in
england
the
duke
of
bucclough
yes
i
have
the
slightest
knowledge
of
what
it
was
all
about
but
evidently
our
spanish
friend
got
the
worst
of
it
he
planned
to
buy
me
in
at
the
sale
but
fortunately
for
me
you
gained
possession
ahead
of
him
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
told
you
all
this
it
came
out
in
a
moment
of
anger
fairfax
looked
at
me
incredulously
see
here
carlyle
he
exclaimed
bluntly
i
am
not
questioning
your
word
but
it
is
a
bit
difficult
for
me
to
understand
why
a
guest
of
mine
should
indulge
in
angry
controversy
with
a
government
prisoner
sent
overseas
for
sale
as
an
indentured
servant
there
must
have
been
some
unusual
cause
have
i
a
right
to
know
what
that
cause
was
without
using
my
authority
to
compel
an
answer
i
hesitated
but
only
for
a
moment
he
undoubtedly
was
entitled
to
know
and
besides
there
was
nothing
involved
i
needed
to
conceal
it
is
my
impression
sir
that
mistress
dorothy
was
the
unconscious
cause
she
chanced
to
discover
me
alone
on
deck
the
night
before
we
landed
and
hastened
to
tell
me
of
your
purchase
it
was
merely
an
act
of
kindness
as
we
had
never
spoken
together
before
we
were
still
talking
across
the
rope
when
sanchez
came
out
of
the
cabin
and
joined
us
i
imagine
he
may
not
have
liked
the
interest
both
you
and
the
young
lady
had
shown
in
me
since
we
came
aboard
anyway
when
he
found
us
there
he
was
not
in
good
humor
mistress
dorothy
resented
his
language
treated
him
coldly
and
finally
departed
leaving
him
decidedly
angry
he
merely
vented
his
spite
on
me
but
he
said
nothing
about
himself
his
motives
not
a
word
sir
yet
it
is
plain
to
be
seen
that
he
is
deeply
interested
in
your
niece
fairfax
frowned
ignoring
the
remark
but
do
you
know
the
man
who
he
is
i
shook
my
head
the
memory
of
haley
flashing
into
my
mind
but
as
instantly
dismissed
as
worthless
fairfax
would
only
laugh
at
such
a
vague
suspicion
yet
why
should
the
planter
ask
me
such
a
question
could
it
be
that
the
spaniard
was
equally
unknown
to
himself
but
if
he
has
quarreled
with
your
brother
he
insisted
unsatisfied
you
perhaps
know
something
i
have
not
seen
my
brother
in
years
i
doubt
if
i
would
know
him
if
we
met
face
to
face
as
to
this
man
my
knowledge
of
him
is
only
what
little
i
have
seen
and
heard
on
board
the
i
answered
soberly
i
confess
a
prejudice
that
i
am
unable
to
judge
him
fairly
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
like
his
race
nor
his
kind
but
i
did
suppose
of
course
that
as
he
was
your
guest
you
considered
him
a
man
worthy
your
hospitality
fairfax
face
reddened
and
he
must
have
felt
the
sting
of
these
words
uttered
as
they
were
by
the
lips
of
his
bondman
i
thought
he
would
turn
abruptly
away
leaving
them
unanswered
but
he
was
too
much
of
a
gentleman
carlyle
he
said
brusquely
you
have
touched
the
exact
point
i
do
not
know
i
thought
i
did
of
course
but
what
has
occurred
on
the
voyage
over
has
led
me
to
doubt
i
met
sanchez
at
the
colonial
club
in
london
he
was
introduced
to
me
by
lord
sandhurst
as
a
wealthy
young
spaniard
traveling
for
pleasure
it
was
understood
that
he
brought
letters
of
introduction
to
a
number
of
high
personages
he
knew
london
well
enjoyed
a
wide
circle
of
acquaintances
and
we
became
rather
intimate
i
found
him
companionable
and
deeply
interested
in
america
which
he
said
he
had
never
visited
finally
i
invited
him
to
accompany
me
as
a
guest
on
my
return
he
accepted
no
not
at
once
he
doubted
if
he
could
break
off
certain
business
engagements
in
england
then
at
a
reception
he
chanced
to
meet
my
niece
and
a
little
later
decided
to
undertake
the
voyage
i
am
inclined
to
believe
she
was
the
determining
factor
very
likely
i
admitted
deciding
now
to
learn
all
possible
details
however
that
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
mistress
dorothy
is
an
exceedingly
attractive
young
woman
the
look
he
gave
me
was
far
from
pleasant
but
she
is
not
a
girl
for
any
spaniard
to
carry
off
as
prize
he
burst
out
hotly
god
mercy
her
father
would
never
forgive
me
if
that
happened
never
fear
i
said
dryly
it
is
not
going
to
happen
why
do
you
say
that
because
i
have
seen
them
together
and
am
not
entirely
blind
watch
them
now
she
scarcely
responds
to
his
words
his
eyes
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
two
but
he
only
shook
his
head
moodily
no
one
knows
what
is
in
the
heart
of
a
woman
carlyle
sanchez
is
fairly
young
handsome
in
a
way
and
adventurous
just
the
sort
to
attract
a
young
girl
and
he
possesses
an
easy
tongue
more
than
that
i
have
lost
faith
in
him
he
is
not
a
gentleman
you
surely
must
have
reason
for
those
words
sir
i
exclaimed
in
surprise
he
has
revealed
to
you
his
true
nature
during
the
voyage
unconsciously
yes
we
have
had
no
exchange
of
words
no
controversy
he
is
even
unaware
that
i
have
observed
these
things
some
were
of
very
small
moment
perhaps
unworthy
of
being
repeated
although
they
served
to
increase
my
doubt
as
to
the
man
character
but
two
instances
remain
indelibly
stamped
on
my
mind
the
first
occurred
when
we
were
only
three
days
at
sea
it
was
at
night
and
the
two
of
us
chanced
to
be
alone
on
deck
i
was
reclining
in
the
shadow
of
the
flag
locker
in
no
mood
for
conversation
and
he
was
unaware
of
my
presence
as
he
tramped
nervously
back
and
forth
suddenly
he
stopped
and
reached
over
into
the
and
when
he
stood
up
again
he
had
the
captain
pet
cat
in
his
hands
before
i
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
he
had
hurled
that
helpless
creature
into
the
water
astern
good
god
an
act
of
wanton
cruelty
the
deliberate
deed
of
a
fiend
of
one
who
seeks
pleasure
in
suffering
and
the
other
incident
was
that
of
the
same
nature
it
was
not
an
incident
but
a
revelation
the
fellow
is
not
only
beneath
his
pretense
of
gentleness
a
fiend
at
heart
but
he
is
also
a
consummate
liar
he
led
me
to
believe
in
london
indeed
he
told
me
so
directly
that
he
was
totally
unacquainted
with
america
it
is
not
true
he
knows
this
entire
coast
even
better
than
i
do
he
forgot
himself
twice
in
conversation
with
me
and
he
was
incautious
enough
to
speak
freely
with
captain
harnes
the
captain
told
me
later
this
begins
to
sound
serious
sir
i
said
as
he
ceased
speaking
do
you
suspect
him
of
any
particular
purpose
in
this
deceit
not
at
present
i
can
only
wait
and
learn
as
a
spanish
naval
officer
he
may
have
obtained
some
knowledge
of
this
coast
but
why
he
should
have
deliberately
denied
the
possession
of
such
information
is
unexplainable
at
present
i
shall
watch
him
closely
and
have
told
you
these
facts
merely
to
put
you
on
guard
i
know
you
to
be
a
gentleman
carlyle
even
though
you
are
temporarily
a
servant
and
i
feel
convinced
i
can
trust
in
your
discretion
you
certainly
can
sir
i
appreciate
your
confidence
in
me
then
keep
your
eyes
and
ears
open
that
all
dorothy
is
calling
and
yonder
comes
sam
we
had
yet
a
full
hour
of
daylight
during
which
little
occurred
of
special
interest
sam
took
the
wheel
while
i
ate
supper
sitting
with
carr
on
the
deck
behind
the
galley
fairfax
and
his
guests
were
served
at
a
table
within
the
small
cabin
and
we
had
a
glimpse
of
them
and
their
surroundings
the
table
prettily
decorated
with
snowy
linen
and
burnished
silver
while
john
in
a
white
jacket
waited
upon
them
obsequiously
lingering
behind
his
master
chair
the
lieutenant
seemed
in
excellent
humor
laughing
often
and
talking
incessantly
although
it
occurred
to
me
the
man
received
scant
encouragement
from
the
others
after
taking
back
to
the
galley
my
emptied
pewter
dish
and
not
being
recalled
aft
to
the
wheel
i
was
glad
to
hang
idly
over
the
rail
watching
the
shore
line
slip
past
and
permit
my
thoughts
to
drift
back
to
my
conversation
with
fairfax
carr
soon
joined
me
rather
anxious
to
continue
our
talk
and
ask
questions
but
not
finding
me
particularly
responsive
finally
departed
forward
leaving
me
alone
the
sun
by
this
time
was
rapidly
sinking
below
the
fringe
of
tall
trees
on
the
but
the
fresh
breeze
held
favorably
and
the
little
was
making
most
excellent
progress
the
water
being
much
smoother
since
we
had
rounded
the
point
we
were
already
beyond
view
of
the
anchored
bark
all
about
was
a
scene
of
loneliness
whether
the
searching
eyes
sought
the
shore
apparently
a
stretch
of
uninhabited
wilderness
densely
forested
or
the
broad
extent
of
the
bay
across
which
no
white
gleam
of
sail
was
visible
all
alike
was
deserted
and
becoming
gloomy
in
the
closing
down
of
night
dorothy
remained
hidden
in
the
cabin
until
about
the
time
of
our
approach
to
the
rude
landing
at
travers
plantation
whether
this
isolation
arose
from
an
effort
to
make
herself
more
presentable
or
a
desire
to
avoid
further
contact
with
the
spaniard
was
a
question
when
she
finally
emerged
at
roger
fairfax
call
and
crossed
the
deck
to
where
the
men
were
there
was
no
alteration
in
her
dress
but
by
that
time
i
was
busily
engaged
with
carr
in
reefing
the
mainsail
and
she
passed
me
by
without
so
much
as
a
glance
of
recognition
meanwhile
fairfax
and
sanchez
paced
restlessly
back
and
forth
conversing
earnestly
as
they
smoked
only
occasionally
pausing
to
contemplate
the
shore
past
which
we
were
gliding
in
silence
the
only
sound
the
ripple
of
water
at
our
stem
where
i
leaned
alone
against
the
rail
my
eyes
followed
the
spaniard
in
doubt
and
questioning
nor
could
i
entirely
banish
from
mind
haley
description
of
that
buccaneer
bearing
a
similar
name
under
whom
he
had
been
compelled
to
serve
through
scenes
of
crime
yet
in
spite
of
my
unconscious
desire
to
connect
these
two
together
i
found
it
simply
impossible
to
associate
this
rather
effeminate
dandy
with
that
bloody
villain
many
of
whose
deeds
were
so
familiar
to
me
the
distinction
was
too
apparent
beyond
all
doubt
this
fellow
concealed
beneath
his
smiles
a
nature
entirely
different
from
the
one
he
now
so
carefully
exhibited
he
could
hate
fiercely
and
nourish
revenge
and
he
was
capable
of
mean
cowardly
cruelty
his
threat
toward
me
as
well
as
that
strange
incident
fairfax
had
observed
on
the
deck
of
the
evidenced
all
this
clearly
yet
such
things
rather
proved
the
man
a
revengeful
coward
instead
of
a
desperate
adventurer
black
sanchez
according
to
all
accounts
was
a
devil
incarnate
and
no
such
popinjay
as
this
maker
of
love
could
ever
be
changed
into
a
terror
of
the
sea
he
was
not
of
that
stern
stuff
that
it
was
perfectly
easy
for
him
to
lie
even
natural
was
no
surprise
to
me
this
seemed
to
accord
with
his
other
characteristics
nor
was
it
altogether
strange
that
he
should
be
fairly
familiar
with
these
waters
if
as
he
claimed
he
had
once
been
connected
with
the
spanish
navy
which
quite
likely
was
true
even
if
he
had
never
visited
this
coast
in
person
he
might
have
had
access
to
their
charts
and
maps
it
was
well
known
that
early
spanish
navigators
had
explored
every
inch
of
this
coast
line
and
that
their
tracings
hastily
as
they
had
been
made
were
the
most
correct
in
existence
his
memory
of
these
might
yet
retain
sufficient
details
through
which
he
could
pretend
to
a
knowledge
much
greater
than
he
really
possessed
no
i
would
dismiss
that
thought
permanently
from
my
mind
as
being
quite
impossible
i
felt
that
i
had
learned
to
judge
men
that
my
long
years
at
sea
both
before
the
mast
and
in
supreme
command
had
developed
this
faculty
so
as
to
be
depended
upon
i
believed
that
i
knew
the
class
to
which
lieutenant
sanchez
belonged
he
was
a
coward
dangerous
only
through
treachery
wearing
a
mask
of
bravado
capable
enough
of
any
crime
or
cruelty
but
devoid
of
boldness
in
plan
or
execution
a
fellow
i
would
kick
with
pleasure
but
against
whom
i
should
never
expect
to
be
obliged
to
draw
a
sword
he
was
a
snake
who
could
never
be
made
into
a
lion
a
character
to
despise
not
fear
and
so
i
dismissed
him
feeling
no
longer
any
serious
sense
of
danger
in
his
presence
yet
fully
determined
to
watch
closely
his
future
movements
in
accordance
with
my
promise
it
was
already
quite
dusk
when
we
finally
drew
in
beside
wharf
and
made
fast
our
approach
had
been
noted
and
travers
himself
a
man
yet
still
hearty
and
vigorous
attired
in
white
duck
was
on
the
end
of
the
dock
to
greet
us
together
with
numerous
servants
of
every
shade
of
color
who
immediately
busied
themselves
toting
luggage
up
the
steep
path
leading
toward
the
house
dimly
visible
in
the
distance
standing
conspicuous
amid
a
grove
of
trees
on
the
summit
of
the
bank
the
others
followed
four
fellows
lugging
with
difficulty
an
chest
the
two
older
men
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
thus
leaving
sanchez
apparently
well
satisfied
with
the
opportunity
alone
to
assist
the
girl
except
to
render
the
sloop
completely
secure
for
the
night
there
remained
little
work
for
us
to
perform
on
board
sam
found
an
ample
supply
of
tobacco
and
pipes
and
the
four
of
us
passed
the
early
evening
undisturbed
smoking
and
talking
together
the
fellows
were
not
uninteresting
as
i
came
to
know
them
better
and
carr
who
i
learned
had
been
transported
three
years
before
for
robbery
having
at
one
time
been
a
soldier
was
prolific
of
reminiscences
which
he
related
with
true
irish
wit
sam
contented
himself
with
asking
me
numerous
questions
relative
to
the
duke
of
monmouth
whose
effort
to
attain
the
throne
interested
him
greatly
and
i
very
gladly
gave
him
all
the
information
i
possessed
so
the
time
passed
quickly
and
it
must
have
been
nearly
midnight
before
we
brought
out
blankets
from
the
forecastle
and
lay
down
in
any
spot
we
chose
on
deck
it
was
a
fair
calm
night
but
moonless
with
but
little
wind
stirring
and
a
slight
haze
in
the
air
obscuring
the
vision
the
windows
of
the
great
house
above
which
earlier
in
the
evening
had
blazed
with
lights
were
now
darkened
and
the
distant
sounds
of
voices
and
laughter
had
entirely
ceased
the
only
noise
discernible
as
i
lay
quiet
was
the
soft
lapping
of
waves
against
the
side
of
the
sloop
or
about
the
piling
supporting
the
wharf
to
which
we
were
moored
the
others
must
have
fallen
asleep
immediately
but
my
own
mind
remained
far
too
active
to
enable
me
to
lose
consciousness
at
last
despairing
of
slumber
and
perchance
urged
by
some
indistinct
premonition
of
danger
i
sat
up
once
more
and
gazed
about
the
three
men
were
lying
not
far
apart
close
in
to
the
galley
wall
merely
dark
shapeless
shadows
barely
to
be
distinguished
in
the
gloom
with
no
longer
any
fear
of
disturbing
them
i
arose
to
my
feet
and
stepping
carefully
past
their
recumbent
forms
moved
silently
aft
toward
the
more
open
space
near
the
wheel
i
had
been
standing
there
hardly
a
minute
staring
blankly
out
into
the
misty
dimness
of
the
bay
when
my
startled
eyes
caught
glimpse
of
a
speck
of
white
emerging
from
the
black
shadows
the
spectral
glimmer
of
a
small
sail
i
was
scarcely
convinced
i
had
seen
it
yet
as
swiftly
crouched
lower
hiding
myself
behind
the
protection
of
the
rail
instantly
alert
to
learn
the
meaning
of
this
strange
apparition
an
instant
told
me
this
was
no
deceit
the
strange
craft
swept
past
so
far
out
that
those
on
board
no
doubt
believed
themselves
beyond
sight
from
the
shore
heading
apparently
for
a
point
of
land
which
i
vaguely
remembered
as
jutting
out
to
the
northward
even
my
eyes
accustomed
to
the
darkness
and
strained
to
the
utmost
could
detect
scarcely
more
than
the
faintest
shadow
gliding
silently
by
yet
sufficient
to
recognize
the
outlines
of
a
small
keel
boat
propelled
by
a
single
lug
sail
and
even
imagined
i
could
discern
the
stooped
figure
of
a
man
at
the
helm
chapter
vii
the
lieutenant
unmasked
i
had
in
truth
hardly
more
than
grasped
the
reality
of
the
presence
it
seemed
so
spectral
a
thing
amid
the
mists
of
the
night
when
it
had
vanished
utterly
once
more
behind
the
curtain
of
darkness
there
was
no
sound
to
convince
me
my
eyes
had
not
deceived
that
i
had
actually
perceived
a
boat
flying
before
the
wind
under
complete
control
and
headed
to
the
northward
no
echo
of
a
voice
came
across
the
water
no
slight
flap
of
sail
no
distant
creak
of
pulley
or
groaning
of
rope
merely
that
fleeting
vision
seemingly
a
phantom
of
imagination
a
vision
born
from
sea
and
cloud
yet
i
knew
i
was
not
deceived
where
the
craft
could
be
bound
for
what
secret
purpose
it
was
afloat
who
were
aboard
were
but
so
many
unanswerable
questions
arising
in
my
mind
i
stared
vainly
into
the
darkness
puzzled
and
uncertain
impressed
alone
by
the
one
controlling
thought
that
some
mysterious
object
some
hidden
purpose
alone
could
account
for
that
swift
silent
passage
where
could
they
have
come
from
unless
from
that
strange
dutch
bark
riding
at
anchor
off
the
point
below
the
passing
craft
had
impressed
me
as
a
ship
boat
and
no
craft
of
fishermen
and
if
it
really
came
from
the
of
had
it
been
sent
in
answer
to
some
signal
by
sanchez
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
they
must
have
chosen
this
late
hour
purposely
they
had
doubtless
endeavored
to
slip
past
us
unobserved
seeking
some
more
desolate
spot
on
the
coast
where
they
might
land
unseen
possibly
deceived
by
the
night
the
helmsman
had
approached
closer
to
the
wharf
than
he
had
intended
yet
nevertheless
if
he
held
to
his
present
course
he
must
surely
touch
shore
not
more
than
five
hundred
yards
distant
in
all
probability
that
was
his
purpose
i
stood
up
tempted
at
first
to
arouse
sam
but
deciding
almost
as
quickly
that
at
present
this
was
unnecessary
i
had
no
wish
to
be
the
occasion
for
laughter
it
would
be
better
first
to
ascertain
who
these
parties
were
rather
than
create
an
unwarranted
alarm
the
reasonable
probability
was
they
composed
merely
a
party
of
innocent
fishermen
returning
home
after
a
day
of
sport
plantation
servants
possibly
who
having
stolen
away
unobserved
were
now
endeavoring
to
beach
their
stolen
boat
and
reach
quarters
without
being
seen
this
theory
appeared
far
more
reasonable
than
the
other
and
if
it
proved
true
to
arouse
the
sleepers
on
deck
would
only
result
in
making
me
a
butt
for
ridicule
it
appeared
safe
enough
for
me
to
adventure
alone
and
i
was
at
least
determined
to
assure
myself
as
to
the
identity
of
these
strangers
if
they
had
actually
landed
it
would
require
only
a
few
moments
to
ascertain
the
truth
and
i
could
accomplish
this
fully
as
well
by
myself
as
though
accompanied
by
others
indeed
with
less
danger
of
discovery
i
quietly
lowered
my
body
over
the
rail
and
found
footing
on
the
wharf
my
knowledge
of
the
path
to
be
pursued
was
extremely
vague
for
our
arrival
had
been
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
so
that
any
observation
of
the
shore
lines
had
been
quite
casual
i
merely
remembered
that
the
bluff
rose
rather
steeply
from
the
water
edge
the
path
leading
upward
toward
the
house
crowning
the
summit
turning
and
twisting
in
order
to
render
the
climb
easier
and
finally
vanishing
entirely
as
it
approached
the
crest
beside
this
leading
downward
straight
to
the
shore
end
of
the
wharf
was
the
broad
slide
along
which
the
bales
and
hogsheads
of
tobacco
were
sent
hurtling
on
their
way
to
market
my
impression
remained
that
the
strip
of
beach
was
decidedly
narrow
and
generally
bordered
by
a
rather
thick
growth
of
dwarfed
shrub
the
point
of
land
beyond
clung
dimly
in
my
memory
as
sparsely
wooded
tapering
at
its
outer
extremity
into
a
sand
bar
against
which
the
restless
waves
of
the
bay
broke
in
lines
of
foam
the
only
feasible
method
of
approach
to
the
spot
i
now
sought
would
be
by
following
this
narrow
strip
of
beach
yet
this
might
be
attempted
safely
as
my
movements
would
be
concealed
by
the
darker
background
of
the
high
bluff
at
the
left
in
spite
of
the
unfamiliarity
of
this
passage
i
succeeded
in
making
excellent
progress
advancing
silently
along
the
soft
sand
assured
i
was
safe
from
observation
by
reason
of
the
intense
darkness
the
waves
lapping
the
beach
helped
muffle
my
footsteps
but
no
other
sound
reached
my
ears
nor
could
my
eyes
perceive
the
slightest
movement
along
the
water
surface
within
reach
of
vision
the
distance
proved
somewhat
greater
than
anticipated
because
of
the
deep
curve
in
the
shore
and
i
had
nearly
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
boat
must
have
rounded
the
point
and
gone
on
when
suddenly
i
was
brought
to
a
halt
by
a
voice
speaking
in
spanish
one
of
those
harsh
croaking
voices
never
to
be
reduced
to
a
whisper
imperfect
as
was
my
knowledge
of
the
tongue
i
yet
managed
a
fair
understanding
of
what
was
being
said
not
the
spot
manuel
of
course
it
is
do
you
not
suppose
i
know
the
cursed
fog
made
me
run
in
close
ashore
to
where
i
could
see
the
sloop
so
as
not
to
mistake
this
is
the
place
and
now
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
wait
the
senor
he
will
be
here
presently
ay
unless
you
misread
the
signal
a
somewhat
more
discreet
but
piping
voice
replied
doubtfully
i
saw
nothing
of
all
you
tell
about
because
you
knew
no
meaning
nor
read
the
instructions
a
touch
of
anger
in
the
tone
i
tell
you
it
was
all
written
out
in
that
letter
brought
to
me
from
england
on
the
they
were
his
last
orders
and
it
was
because
of
them
that
we
anchored
off
the
point
yonder
and
explored
this
coast
you
saw
the
senor
touch
the
handkerchief
to
his
cheek
as
he
went
forward
alone
yes
surely
it
was
that
motion
which
bade
us
come
here
manuel
once
for
each
cursed
plantation
along
this
west
coast
from
the
point
he
touched
the
cloth
to
his
cheek
but
the
once
and
this
is
the
first
i
watched
for
the
sign
with
care
for
he
is
not
one
with
whom
to
make
a
mistake
dios
de
dios
do
i
not
know
estada
have
i
not
a
scar
here
which
tells
true
enough
and
have
i
not
received
also
my
lesson
eight
hours
staked
face
upward
in
the
sun
so
is
my
very
life
wagered
on
this
being
the
place
named
besides
is
proven
by
the
sloop
lying
there
by
the
wharf
where
then
is
the
captain
perversely
unsatisfied
at
the
house
yonder
on
the
hill
where
else
he
knew
how
it
would
be
for
this
is
not
his
first
visit
to
the
bay
was
because
of
his
knowledge
he
could
plan
in
england
tis
the
custom
of
these
planters
to
stop
by
night
along
the
way
and
go
ashore
not
to
camp
but
as
guests
of
some
friend
only
beforehand
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
know
which
plantation
would
be
the
one
chosen
that
was
what
he
must
signal
you
see
it
now
clearly
estada
he
is
the
same
wary
fox
as
of
old
never
do
they
catch
him
napping
proudly
santa
maria
have
i
not
seen
it
tried
often
in
ten
years
about
his
plan
here
he
wrote
you
his
purpose
not
so
much
as
a
word
merely
the
order
what
to
do
dios
he
tells
nothing
for
he
trusts
no
man
a
good
thing
that
yet
i
have
my
own
thought
manuel
and
what
is
that
the
other
hesitated
as
though
endeavoring
to
rearrange
the
idea
in
his
own
mind
and
possibly
doubtful
of
how
much
to
confide
to
his
companion
when
he
finally
replied
his
words
came
forth
so
swiftly
i
could
scarcely
grasp
their
meaning
with
my
slight
knowledge
of
the
tongue
is
no
more
than
that
i
make
a
guess
friend
yet
i
have
been
with
the
captain
for
ten
years
now
and
know
his
way
this
planter
fairfax
is
rich
the
letter
says
nothing
of
that
no
not
a
word
but
i
made
inquiries
ashore
there
is
no
one
more
wealthy
in
these
colonies
and
he
returns
now
from
london
after
the
sale
of
his
tobacco
crop
no
doubt
he
sold
for
his
neighbors
also
is
the
way
they
do
form
a
combine
and
send
an
agent
to
england
to
get
the
best
price
he
will
surely
bear
back
with
him
a
great
sum
this
the
senor
knows
nor
is
it
the
first
time
he
has
done
the
trick
manuel
santa
maria
is
the
easiest
one
of
all
then
there
is
the
girl
the
one
who
was
aboard
the
sloop
of
course
i
knew
nothing
of
her
but
i
have
keen
eyes
and
i
have
been
long
with
the
senor
marked
you
not
how
he
approached
her
no
sea
rover
ever
had
greater
desire
for
women
or
won
them
easier
is
a
bright
eye
and
red
lip
that
wins
him
from
all
else
even
to
me
this
one
looked
a
rare
beauty
yet
am
i
sorry
he
found
her
for
it
may
delay
the
task
here
why
must
you
fear
that
bah
but
you
are
stupid
who
will
take
by
force
what
may
be
won
by
a
few
soft
words
he
paused
suddenly
evidently
struck
by
a
new
thought
yet
i
think
manuel
the
captain
may
have
failed
in
this
case
i
watched
their
greeting
and
her
was
not
that
of
love
if
this
be
true
we
strike
at
once
while
it
is
safe
here
you
mean
tonight
and
why
not
here
and
tonight
is
there
a
better
spot
or
time
with
another
night
the
sloop
will
be
far
up
the
bay
while
now
from
where
we
are
anchored
we
could
be
beyond
the
capes
by
daybreak
with
the
broad
ocean
before
us
we
are
five
six
with
the
senor
and
our
ship
lies
but
a
short
league
away
ready
for
sea
there
are
only
four
men
on
the
sloop
with
some
servants
above
spiritless
fellows
why
else
should
he
have
signaled
our
coming
unless
there
was
work
to
do
that
will
be
the
plan
to
my
notion
the
money
and
the
girl
in
one
swoop
then
a
quick
sail
to
the
southward
pist
is
boys
play
the
other
seemed
to
lick
his
lips
as
though
the
picture
thus
drawn
greatly
pleased
him
gracioso
dios
i
hope
is
so
it
has
been
dull
enough
here
this
month
past
i
am
for
blue
water
and
an
english
ship
to
sack
or
better
yet
a
week
at
porto
grande
hey
manuel
the
girls
are
not
so
bad
with
clink
of
gold
in
the
pocket
after
a
cruise
wait
though
there
is
someone
coming
down
i
crouched
backward
into
the
bushes
and
a
moment
later
the
newcomer
moved
past
me
scarcely
a
yard
distant
along
the
narrow
strip
of
sand
he
appeared
no
more
than
a
black
shadow
wrapped
in
a
loose
cloak
thus
rendered
so
shapeless
as
to
be
scarcely
recognizable
directly
opposite
my
covert
he
paused
peering
forward
in
uncertainty
estada
he
spoke
the
name
cautiously
and
in
doubt
ay
captain
and
another
figure
also
shapeless
and
emerged
noiselessly
from
the
gloom
we
await
you
good
the
tone
one
of
relief
i
rather
questioned
if
you
caught
my
signal
i
was
watched
and
obliged
to
exercise
care
how
many
have
you
here
four
senor
with
manuel
estevan
quite
sufficient
and
how
about
the
others
all
safely
aboard
senor
asleep
in
their
bunks
by
now
but
ready
francois
levere
has
charge
of
the
deck
watch
ah
how
happens
it
the
quadroon
is
with
you
a
good
choice
yet
that
must
mean
the
is
still
at
porto
grande
for
what
reason
because
of
greater
injuries
than
we
supposed
captain
there
were
two
shots
in
her
below
the
water
line
and
to
get
at
them
we
were
obliged
to
beach
her
levere
came
with
us
expecting
this
job
would
be
done
before
now
for
by
this
time
the
schooner
should
be
in
water
again
her
sides
scraped
clean
of
barnacles
fit
for
any
cruise
we
have
been
waiting
for
you
along
this
coast
for
several
weeks
yes
i
know
the
boat
we
intended
to
take
met
with
an
accident
while
the
one
we
did
take
proved
the
slowest
tub
that
ever
sailed
how
is
it
here
are
there
suspicions
none
senor
we
have
cruised
outside
most
of
the
time
only
once
were
we
hailed
while
manuel
with
a
boat
crew
was
ashore
for
nearly
a
week
picking
up
such
news
as
he
might
there
is
no
warship
in
these
waters
so
i
discovered
on
landing
indeed
i
was
told
as
much
in
england
however
your
disguise
is
perfect
estada
laughed
there
is
no
mistaking
where
the
came
from
senor
holland
from
keel
to
topmast
but
the
best
sailing
dutchman
i
ever
saw
you
said
you
were
being
watched
on
the
sloop
are
you
known
the
other
uttered
an
oath
snarling
through
his
teeth
is
nothing
he
explained
contemptuously
no
more
than
the
bite
of
a
harmless
snake
in
the
grass
a
dog
of
a
servant
who
came
over
with
us
one
of
monmouth
brood
he
has
no
knowledge
of
who
i
am
nor
suspicion
of
my
purpose
it
is
not
that
yet
the
fellow
watches
me
like
a
hawk
we
had
some
words
aboard
and
there
is
hate
between
us
if
he
was
indentured
how
came
he
on
the
sloop
fairfax
bought
him
the
fellow
won
the
interest
of
the
girl
coming
over
and
she
interceded
in
his
behalf
it
was
my
plan
to
get
him
into
my
own
hands
i
have
taught
him
a
lesson
but
the
papers
were
signed
before
we
landed
yet
the
lad
is
not
through
with
me
i
do
not
let
go
in
a
hurry
may
i
ask
you
your
plans
senor
yes
i
am
here
to
explain
are
we
out
of
none
can
hear
us
manuel
has
gone
back
to
the
boat
then
listen
this
planter
fairfax
has
returned
from
england
with
a
large
sum
it
is
in
gold
and
notes
i
have
been
unable
to
learn
the
exact
amount
but
it
represents
the
proceeds
in
cash
of
the
tobacco
crop
of
himself
and
a
number
of
his
neighbors
they
pooled
and
made
him
their
agent
without
doubt
from
all
i
could
ascertain
it
will
be
upward
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
not
a
bad
bit
of
pocket
money
this
still
remains
in
his
possession
but
a
part
will
be
dispersed
tomorrow
so
if
we
hope
to
gain
the
whole
we
must
do
so
now
fifty
thousand
pounds
you
say
gracioso
dios
a
sum
worth
fighting
for
ay
we
done
some
hard
fighting
for
less
it
is
here
under
our
very
hands
and
there
could
be
no
better
place
than
this
in
which
to
take
it
everything
is
ready
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
suspicion
of
danger
not
even
a
guard
set
over
the
treasure
i
assured
myself
of
this
before
coming
down
then
it
is
at
the
house
in
an
chest
carried
up
from
the
sloop
and
placed
in
the
room
assigned
to
fairfax
for
the
night
he
considers
it
perfectly
safe
under
his
bed
but
before
we
attempt
reaching
this
we
must
attend
to
those
men
left
below
on
the
boat
they
are
the
only
dangerous
ones
for
there
are
none
of
the
fighting
sort
up
above
only
two
servants
sleep
in
the
main
house
the
cook
and
a
maid
both
women
the
others
are
in
the
slave
quarters
a
half
mile
away
fairfax
is
vigorous
and
will
put
up
a
fight
if
he
has
any
chance
he
must
be
taken
care
of
before
he
does
have
any
travers
is
an
old
man
to
be
knocked
out
with
a
blow
all
we
have
to
fear
are
those
fellows
on
the
sloop
and
they
will
have
to
be
attended
to
quietly
without
any
alarm
reaching
the
house
i
am
going
to
leave
that
job
to
you

not
your
first
the
old

that
will
be
quicker
and
surer
the
voice
hardened
in
gust
of
sudden
ferocity
but
mark
you
with
one
exception
the
englishman
is
not
to
be
killed
if
he
can
be
taken
alive
i
would
deal
with
him
how
are
we
to
recognize
him
from
the
others
pish
a
blind
man
would
know
he
is
the
only
one
of
that
blood
on
board
taller
and
heavier
of
build
with
blond
hair
a
mistake
and
you
pay
for
it
besides
him
there
are
two
negroes
and
an
irish
fool
it
matters
not
what
happens
to
them
a
knife

the
heart

the
more
silent
but
i
would
have
this
geoffry
carlyle
left
alive
to
face
me
you
will
do
well
to
remember
i
will
pass
the
word
to
the
men
see
that
you
do
then
after
that
sanchez
went
on
deliberately
as
though
murder
was
of
small
account

will
follow
me
up
the
bluff
who
are
the
others
with
you
carl
anderson
pedro

and
cochose
well
chosen
mendez
is
the
least
valuable
and
we
will
leave

boat
the
big
negro

together
with
manuel

attend
to

and
the
two
negresses
they
sleep
below
that
will
leave
you
and
the
swede
to
get
the
chest
no
firearms
if
they
can
be
avoided
you
are
certain
of
the
way
senor
in
the
dark
i
have
been
over
the
house
and
drawn
a
rude
diagram
you
can
look
it
over
in
the
cabin
of
the
sloop
after
affairs
have
been
attended
to
there
the
stairs
lead
up
from
the
front
hall
i
will
go
with
you
to
the
door
of
fairfax
room
estada
hesitated
as
though
afraid
to
further
question
his
chief
yet
finally
in
spite
of
this
fear
the
query
broke
from
his
lips
and
you
senor
the
girl
what
know
you
of
any
girl
that
there
was
one
on
the
deck
of
the
sloop
an
english
beauty
it
was
when
you
turned
to
greet
her
that
you
gave
me
the
signal
i
merely
thought
that
perhaps
then
stop
thinking
burst
forth
sanchez
enraged
thinking
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
work
if
there
is
a
girl
i
attend
to
her
let
that
suffice
dios
am
i
chief
here
or
are
you
you
have
my
orders
now
obey
them
and
hold
your
tongue
bring
the
men
up
here
without
a
word
evidently
glad
to
escape
thus
easily
estada
vanished
into
the
gloom
leaving
behind
only
the
vague
figure
of
sanchez
pacing
the
sands
his
lips
muttering
curses
i
dared
not
move
scarcely
indeed
to
breathe
so
closely
did
he
skirt
my
covert
to
venture
forth
would
mean
certain
discovery
nor
could
i
hope
to
steal
away
through
the
bushes
where
any
twig
might
snap
beneath
my
foot
what
could
i
do
how
could
i
bring
warning
to
those
sleeping
victims
this
heartless
discussion
of
robbery
and
murder
left
me
cold
with
horror
yet
helpless
to
lift
a
hand
i
had
no
thought
of
myself
of
my
possible
fate
when
once
delivered
into
the
hands
of
this
monster
this
arch
villain
but
all
my
agony
of
mind
centered
on
the
imminent
danger
confronting
dorothy
fairfax
and
those
unsuspecting
men
all
my
preconceived
impressions
of
sanchez
had
vanished
he
was
no
longer
in
my
imagination
a
weakling
a
boastful
cowardly
bravado
a
fool
but
a
leader
of
desperate
men
a
villain
of
the
deepest
dye
the
dreaded
pirate
black
sanchez
whose
deeds
of
crime
were
without
number
and
whose
name
was
infamous
confronted
by
gold
maddened
by
the
girl
contemptuous
indifference
no
deed
of
violence
and
blood
was
too
revolting
for
him
to
commit
what
he
could
not
win
by
words
he
would
seize
by
force
and
make
his
own
as
coolly
as
another
might
sell
a
bolt
of
cloth
he
would
plan
murder
and
rape
and
then
smilingly
watch
the
execution
and
i
what
could
i
do
the
little
band
of
men
emerged
from
the
concealment
of
the
fog
noiselessly
and
gathered
into
a
group
about
the
figure
of
sanchez
where
he
stood
motionless
awaiting
them
i
could
distinguish
no
faces
scarcely
indeed
the
outlines
of
their
separate
forms
in
the
gloom
but
one
was
an
unusually
big
fellow
far
taller
and
heavier
than
his
companions
when
he
spoke
he
possessed
a
negro
voice
and
i
recognized
him
at
once
for
cochose
the
captain
swept
his
impatient
eyes
about
the
circle
lads
he
said
incisively
a
sharper
note
of
leadership
in
the
tone
it
has
been
a
bit
quiet
for
you
lately
but
now
i
am
back
again
and
we
try
our
luck
at
sea
once
more
there
must
be
many
a
laden
ship
waiting
for
us
does
that
sound
good
there
was
a
savage
growl
of
response
a
sudden
leaning
forward
of
dark
figures
i
thought
it
would
we
begin
on
a
job
tonight
there
are
fifty
thousand
pounds
for
us
in
that
house
yonder
and
i
waive
my
share
estada
will
explain
to
you
the
work
i
want
done
see
that
you
do
it
quietly
and
well
by
daylight
we
shall
be
on
blue
water
with
our
course
set
for
porto
grande
how
is
it
bullies
do
you
sniff
the
salt
sea
ay
ay
captain
and
see
the
pretty
girls
waiting
and
hear
the
chink
of
gold
ay
senor
then
do
not
fail
me
tonight
and
remember
it
is
to
be
the
knife
estada
here
senor
i
have
forgotten
one
thing
scuttle
the
sloop
before
joining
me
is
better
to
make
all
safe
and
now
strong
arms
and
good
luck
go
to
your
task
and
if
one
fails
me
it
will
mean
the
lash
at
the
they
moved
off
one
by
one
estada
leading
along
the
narrow
strip
of
sand
five
of
them
on
their
mission
of
murder
the
leader
remained
alone
his
back
toward
where
i
crouched
his
eyes
following
their
vanishing
figures
until
the
night
had
swallowed
them
chapter
viii
a
victory
and
a
defeat
i
arose
silently
to
my
feet
conscious
of
possessing
no
weapon
yet
fully
aware
that
all
hope
of
thwarting
this
villainy
lay
in
immediate
action
but
i
must
await
the
right
moment
even
with
the
advantage
of
surprise
there
would
inevitably
be
the
noise
of
struggle
i
had
in
the
past
despised
sanchez
but
i
had
never
yet
tested
him
as
a
fighting
man
and
indeed
no
longer
considered
the
fellow
to
be
a
mean
antagonist
remembering
who
he
was
i
now
realized
fully
the
desperate
nature
of
my
attempt
the
need
of
quick
remorseless
action
nevertheless
i
dared
not
attack
until
assured
that
those
men
he
had
just
dispatched
were
safely
beyond
i
could
hear
or
see
nothing
of
them
they
had
vanished
utterly
and
the
soft
sand
returned
no
echo
of
their
footsteps
time
alone
gave
me
judgment
as
to
the
distance
they
would
travel
if
i
yielded
too
much
of
this
they
might
attain
the
sloop
before
i
could
sound
an
alarm
while
if
i
moved
too
quickly
the
noise
would
bring
them
back
to
the
rescue
the
moments
were
agony
as
i
bent
tensely
forward
poised
for
a
leap
god
i
could
wait
no
longer
sanchez
had
turned
slightly
apparently
immersed
in
thought
and
stood
with
his
face
toward
the
bay
even
in
that
darkness
his
position
was
that
of
a
man
intently
listening
for
the
slightest
sound
to
reach
him
out
of
the
black
night
i
ventured
a
cautious
step
forward
and
stood
on
the
open
sand
scarcely
a
yard
to
his
rear
every
nerve
throbbing
my
lips
still
silently
counting
the
seconds
i
could
not
i
dared
not
wait
longer
some
vague
sense
of
my
presence
must
have
influenced
the
man
for
he
swung
suddenly
about
uttering
a
stifled
cry
of
startled
surprise
as
we
met
face
to
face
for
an
instant
we
were
locked
so
closely
within
each
other
desperate
grip
his
head
bent
beneath
my
arm
with
my
fingers
clutching
at
his
throat
to
block
any
call
for
help
that
he
possessed
no
knowledge
of
his
assailant
identity
but
the
man
was
like
a
tiger
possessed
of
immense
strength
encased
in
a
wiry
frame
the
surprise
of
attack
was
to
my
advantage
yet
almost
before
i
realized
what
was
being
done
he
had
rallied
broken
my
first
hold
and
his
eyes
were
glaring
straight
into
mine
then
he
knew
me
signaling
his
discovery
with
an
oath
his
free
hand
instantly
grasping
at
the
knife
concealed
beneath
his
loose
cloak
even
as
he
jerked
it
forth
i
crushed
his
wrist
within
my
fingers
forcing
his
back
breast
to
breast
we
wrestled
for
mastery
every
muscle
strained
our
feet
firm
planted
on
the
sand
there
was
no
outcry
no
noise
except
that
of
our
heavy
breathing
and
trampling
feet
personal
hatred
had
ascendancy
in
both
our
hearts
i
doubt
if
he
ever
thought
of
aught
else
but
the
desire
to
kill
me
there
with
his
own
hands
only
once
did
he
even
utter
a
word
hissing
out
the
sentence
as
though
it
were
a
poison
to
hell
with
you
you
sneaking
english
cur
then
i
travel
that
road
not
alone
i
muttered
back
there
will
be
one
less
of
the
devil
brood
afloat
what
followed
has
to
me
no
clearness
no
consistency
i
remember
yet
it
is
as
though
memory
played
me
a
thousand
tricks
never
have
i
fought
more
wickedly
nor
with
deeper
realization
that
i
needed
every
ounce
of
strength
and
every
trick
of
wit
and
skill
i
had
not
before
dreamed
he
was
such
a
man
but
now
i
knew
the
fellow
possessed
greater
knowledge
of
the
game
than
i
and
a
quicker
movement
i
alone
excelled
in
weight
of
body
and
coolness
of
brain
his
efforts
were
those
of
an
infuriated
animal
his
uncontrolled
outburst
of
hatred
rendering
him
utterly
reckless
of
results
in
his
struggle
to
overcome
me
at
any
cost
it
was
this
blind
which
gave
me
victory
i
know
not
clearly
how
it
was
done
my
only
memory
being
his
frantic
efforts
to
drive
home
the
knife
point
and
mine
to
defeat
the
thrust
twice
he
pricked
me
deep
enough
to
draw
blood
before
i
succeeded
in
twisting
backward
the
arm
with
which
he
held
the
blade
it
was
a
sailor
trick
of
last
resort
heartlessly
cruel
in
its
agony
but
i
felt
then
no
call
to
mercy
he
met
the
game
too
late
falling
half
back
upon
one
knee
hoping
thus
to
foil
my
purpose
yet
my
greater
weight
saved
me
there
was
the
sharp
crack
of
a
bone
as
his
useless
fingers
let
the
knife
drop
a
snarled
curse
of
pain
and
then
with
the
rage
of
a
mad
dog
sanchez
struck
his
teeth
deep
into
my
cheek
the
sharp
pang
of
pain
drove
me
to
frenzy
and
for
the
first
time
i
lost
all
control
my
one
free
hand
seeking
to
reach
the
lost
knife
with
a
thrill
of
exultation
i
gripped
it
driving
instantly
the
keen
blade
to
its
hilt
into
the
man
side
he
made
no
cry
no
struggle
the
set
teeth
unlocked
and
he
fell
limply
back
on
the
sand
his
head
lapped
by
the
waves
i
remained
poised
above
him
spent
and
breathless
from
struggle
scarcely
conscious
even
as
to
what
had
occurred
so
swiftly
the
dripping
knife
in
my
hand
blood
streaming
down
my
cheek
and
still
infuriated
by
blind
passion
the
fellow
lay
motionless
his
face
upturned
to
the
sky
but
invisible
except
in
dim
outline
it
did
not
seem
possible
he
could
actually
be
dead
i
had
struck
blindly
with
no
knowledge
as
to
where
the
keen
blade
had
penetrated
a
mere
desperate
lunge
i
rested
my
ear
over
his
heart
detecting
no
murmur
of
response
touched
the
veins
of
his
wrist
but
found
there
no
answering
throb
of
life
still
dazed
and
uncertain
i
arose
staggering
to
my
feet
conscious
at
last
that
the
man
must
actually
be
dead
yet
for
the
moment
so
surprised
by
the
discovery
as
to
scarcely
realize
its
significance
not
that
i
regretted
the
act
not
that
i
experienced
the
slightest
remorse
yet
for
an
instant
the
shock
seemed
to
leave
me
nerveless
and
unstrung
only
a
moment
since
i
was
engaged
in
desperate
struggle
and
now
i
could
only
stare
down
at
the
dark
lines
of
that
motionless
body
outstretched
upon
the
sand
then
i
remembered
those
others
the
unconscious
sleepers
on
the
deck
of
the
sloop
those
villains
creeping
toward
them
through
the
black
shadows
of
the
night
the
memory
was
like
a
dash
of
water
in
the
face
with
the
knife
still
gripped
in
my
hand
i
raced
forward
along
the
narrow
strip
of
sand
reckless
of
what
i
might
encounter
eager
only
to
arrive
in
time
to
give
utterance
to
a
shout
of
warning
i
could
not
have
covered
more
than
half
the
distance
when
the
first
sound
of
attack
reached
me
gurgling
cry
of
agony
which
pierced
the
darkness
like
the
scream
of
a
dying
soul
the
heart
leaped
into
my
throat
yet
i
ran
on
unhalted
unseen
until
the
planks
of
the
wharf
were
beneath
my
feet
the
low
side
of
the
sloop
looming
black
before
me
there
was
confusion
aboard
the
sounds
of
struggle
mingled
with
curses
and
blows
with
one
upward
swing
of
my
body
i
was
safely
aboard
knife
still
in
hand
peering
eagerly
forward
through
the
gloom
concealing
the
deck
i
could
perceive
only
dim
figures
a
riot
of
men
battling
furiously
hand
to
hand
yet
out
of
the
ruck
loomed
through
the
darkness
in
larger
outline
than
the
others
the
negro
i
leaped
at
the
fellow
and
struck
with
the
keen
knife
missing
the
heart
but
plunging
the
blade
deep
into
the
flesh
of
the
shoulder
the
next
instant
i
was
in
a
bear
grip
the
very
breath
crushed
out
of
me
yet
by
some
chance
my
one
arm
remained
free
and
i
drove
the
sharp
steel
into
him
twice
before
he
forced
the
weapon
from
my
fingers
through
a
trick
although
my
wrist
was
as
numb
as
if
dead
from
his
fierce
grip
i
thrust
an
elbow
beneath
the
brute
chin
and
thus
forced
his
head
back
until
the
neck
cracked
this
respite
served
merely
for
the
moment
yet
sufficiently
long
to
win
me
a
firm
on
deck
and
a
breath
of
night
air
he
was
too
strong
too
immense
of
stature
apparently
unweakened
by
his
wounds
the
giant
negro
thoroughly
aroused
exerted
his
mighty
muscles
and
despite
my
utmost
effort
at
resistance
thrust
me
back
against
the
stern
rail
where
the
weight
of
his
body
pinned
me
helplessly
with
a
roar
of
rage
he
drove
his
huge
fist
into
my
face
but
happily
was
too
close
to
give
much
force
to
the
blow
my
own
hands
gripping
the
of
his
coarse
shirt
twisted
it
tight
about
the
great
throat
until
in
desperation
panting
for
breath
the
huge
brute
actually
lifted
me
in
his
arms
and
hurled
me
backward
headlong
over
the
rail
i
struck
something
as
i
fell
yet
rebounding
from
this
splashed
into
the
deep
water
and
went
down
so
nearly
unconscious
as
to
make
not
even
the
slightest
struggle
i
had
no
strength
left
in
me
no
desire
to
save
myself
and
i
sank
like
a
stone
and
yet
i
came
up
once
more
to
the
surface
arising
by
sheer
chance
directly
beneath
the
small
dory
which
my
body
must
have
struck
as
i
fell
towing
by
a
painter
astern
of
the
sloop
and
fortunately
retained
sense
enough
to
cling
desperately
to
this
first
thing
my
hands
touched
and
thus
remained
concealed
this
occurred
through
complete
exhaustion
rather
than
the
exercising
of
any
judgment
for
had
it
not
been
for
this
providential
support
i
would
surely
have
drowned
without
a
struggle
every
breath
i
drew
was
in
pain
i
felt
as
though
my
ribs
had
been
crushed
in
while
i
had
lost
sufficient
blood
to
leave
me
as
weak
as
a
babe
i
simply
clung
there
desperately
hopelessly
yet
the
salt
water
soon
served
to
revive
me
physically
and
even
my
brain
began
to
arouse
from
its
daze
to
a
faint
realization
of
the
conditions
the
small
dory
to
which
i
clung
caught
in
some
mysterious
current
floated
at
the
very
extremity
of
its
slender
towline
and
in
consequence
the
sloop
appeared
little
more
than
a
mere
smudge
when
my
eyes
endeavored
to
discover
its
outlines
evidently
the
bloody
work
had
been
completed
for
now
all
was
silent
on
board
i
could
not
even
detect
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
deck
then
clear
enough
to
be
distinctly
heard
across
the
narrow
strip
of
water
came
the
voice
of
estada
in
a
gruff
inquiry
so
you
are
hiding
here
cochose
what
are
you
looking
for
in
the
sea
what
why
that
damned
englishman
the
response
was
a
savage
growl
intensified
by
husky
dialect
mon
dieu
he
fought
me
like
a
mad
rat
the
englishman
you
say
he
was
here
then
it
was
he
you
battled
with
what
became
of
the
fellow
he
went
down
there
senor
the
dog
stabbed
me
three
times
it
was
either
he
or
i
to
go
you
mean
you
threw
him
overboard
ay
with
his
ribs
crushed
in
and
not
a
breath
left
in
his
damned
body
he
never
come
up
even
i
watched
and
there
has
not
been
so
much
as
a
ripple
where
he
sank
the
two
must
have
hung
in
silence
over
the
rail
staring
down
i
dared
not
advance
my
head
to
look
nor
even
move
a
muscle
of
my
body
in
the
water
but
both
were
still
standing
there
when
estada
finally
gave
utterance
to
an
oath
how
know
you
it
was
the
man
who
else
could
it
have
been
you
have
the
others
ay
true
enough
yet
it
will
go
hard
with
you
cochose
when
the
captain
learns
of
this
he
would
have
the
fellow
alive
as
well
attempt
to
take
a
tiger
with
bare
hands
see
the
blood
yet
runs
a
single
inch
to
the
left
and
it
would
be
i
fed
to
the
fishes
pah
what
is
the
difference
senor
so
the
man
dies
right
enough
no
doubt
anyway
it
is
not
i
who
must
face
sanchez
and
it
is
too
late
now
to
change
fate
let
to
the
rest
of
our
task
you
can
still
do
your
part
the
giant
negro
growled
ay
i
have
been
worse
hurt
yet
a
bit
of
cloth
would
help
me
let
carl
see
to
that
while
i
gain
glimpse
at
this
map
of
the
house
up
yonder
come
forward
with
me
to
the
cabin
till
i
light
a
candle
how
came
you
aft
here
because
that
fellow
leaped
the
rail
from
the
wharf
i
saw
him
and
we
met
at
the
wheel
from
the
wharf
you
say
he
was
not
aboard
then
santa
maria
i
know
not
what
that
may
mean
yet
what
difference
so
he
be
dead
anderson
mendez
throw
that
carrion
overboard
no
bullies
never
mind
let
them
lie
where
they
are
and
sink
an
auger
in
the
sloop
bottom
that
will
settle
the
whole
matter
what
is
that
out
yonder
cochose
a
small
boat
senor
a
dory
i
make
it
cut
the
rope
and
send
it
adrift
now
come
along
with
me
the
darker
loom
of
the
sloop
vanished
slowly
as
the
slight
current
sweeping
about
the
end
of
the
wharf
drifted
the
released
boat
to
which
i
clung
outward
into
the
bay
the
faint
echo
of
a
voice
floated
to
my
ears
across
the
widening
expanse
of
water
and
then
all
was
silent
as
the
night
closed
in
darkly
between
there
was
scarcely
a
ripple
to
the
sea
and
yet
i
felt
that
the
boat
was
steadily
drifting
out
into
deeper
water
i
was
still
strangely
weak
barely
able
to
retain
my
grasp
with
a
peculiar
dullness
in
my
head
which
made
me
fearful
that
at
any
moment
i
might
let
go
i
was
not
even
conscious
of
thinking
or
capable
of
conceiving
clearly
my
situation
yet
i
must
have
realized
vaguely
the
immediate
necessity
of
action
for
finally
i
mustered
every
ounce
of
remaining
energy
in
one
supreme
effort
and
succeeded
in
dragging
my
body
up
out
of
water
over
the
boat
stern
sinking
helplessly
forward
into
the
bottom
the
moment
this
was
accomplished
every
sense
deserted
me
and
i
lay
there
motionless
totally
unconscious
i
shall
never
know
how
long
i
remained
thus
the
little
dory
in
which
i
lay
rocked
aimlessly
about
by
the
waves
and
constantly
drifting
in
the
grasp
of
unseen
currents
farther
and
farther
out
into
the
bay
the
blackness
of
the
night
swallowed
us
as
tossed
by
wind
and
sea
we
were
borne
on
through
the
waste
unguided
yet
this
time
could
not
have
been
great
as
though
awakening
from
sleep
a
faint
consciousness
returned
causing
me
to
lift
my
head
and
stare
hopelessly
about
into
the
curtain
of
mist
overhanging
the
water
at
first
with
nothing
surrounding
to
awaken
memory
into
action
only
that
dull
vista
of
sea
and
sky
my
mind
refused
to
respond
to
any
impression
then
the
sharp
pain
of
my
wounds
accented
by
the
sting
of
salt
water
brought
me
swift
realization
of
where
i
was
and
the
circumstances
bringing
me
there
my
wet
clothing
had
partially
dried
on
my
body
as
i
lay
there
motionless
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
now
with
every
movement
chafed
the
raw
spots
rendering
the
slightest
motion
a
physical
agony
i
had
evidently
lost
considerable
blood
yet
this
had
already
ceased
to
flow
and
a
very
slight
examination
served
to
convince
me
that
the
knife
slashes
were
none
of
them
serious
beyond
these
punctures
of
the
flesh
while
i
ached
from
head
to
foot
my
other
injuries
were
merely
bruises
to
add
to
my
discomfort
the
result
of
blows
dealt
me
by
sanchez
and
cochose
aggravated
by
the
bearlike
hug
of
the
giant
negro
indeed
i
awoke
to
the
discovery
that
i
was
far
from
being
a
dead
man
and
inspired
by
this
knowledge
the
various
incidents
of
the
night
flashed
swiftly
back
into
my
mind
how
long
had
i
been
lying
there
unconscious
adrift
in
the
open
boat
how
far
had
we
floated
from
land
where
were
we
now
and
in
the
meantime
what
had
occurred
ashore
these
were
questions
impossible
to
answer
i
could
not
even
attempt
their
solution
no
gleam
of
light
appeared
in
any
direction
no
sound
echoed
across
the
dark
waste
of
water
far
above
barely
visible
through
a
floating
veil
of
haze
i
was
able
to
detect
the
faint
gleam
of
stars
and
was
sailor
enough
to
determine
through
their
guidance
some
certainty
as
to
the
points
of
compass
yet
possessed
no
means
by
which
to
ascertain
the
time
of
night
or
the
position
of
the
boat
with
this
handicap
it
was
clearly
impossible
for
me
to
attempt
any
return
to
the
wharf
through
the
impenetrable
black
curtain
which
shut
me
in
what
then
could
i
do
what
might
i
still
hope
to
accomplish
at
first
thought
the
case
appeared
hopeless
those
fellows
had
swept
the
sloop
clean
and
had
doubtless
long
ago
scuttled
it
this
ruthless
deed
once
accomplished
their
orders
were
to
raid
the
house
on
the
bluff
but
would
they
go
on
with
their
bloody
work
they
would
suddenly
find
themselves
leaderless
unguided
would
that
suffice
to
stop
them
the
vivid
memory
came
to
me
anew
of
that
arch
villain
sanchez
lying
where
i
had
left
him
his
head
resting
in
the
surf
dead
would
the
discovery
of
his
body
halt
his
followers
and
send
them
rushing
back
to
their
boat
eager
only
to
get
safely
away
this
did
not
seem
likely
estada
knew
of
my
boarding
the
sloop
from
the
wharf
and
would
at
once
connect
the
fact
of
my
being
ashore
with
the
killing
of
sanchez
this
would
satisfy
him
there
was
no
further
danger
besides
these
were
not
men
to
be
easily
frightened
at
sight
of
a
dead
body
even
that
of
their
own
captain
they
might
hesitate
discuss
but
they
would
never
flee
in
panic
surely
not
with
that
ruffian
estada
yet
alive
to
lead
them
and
the
knowledge
that
fifty
thousand
pounds
was
yonder
in
that
unguarded
house
with
no
one
to
protect
the
treasure
but
two
old
men
asleep
and
the
women
the
women
dorothy
what
would
become
of
her
into
whose
hands
would
she
fall
in
that
foul
division
of
spoils
estada
good
god
yes
and
i
afloat
and
helpless
in
this
boat
what
could
i
do
chapter
ix
a
swim
to
the
namur
all
was
black
hopeless
with
head
buried
in
my
hands
i
sat
on
a
thwart
dazed
and
stupefied
seemingly
even
unable
to
think
clearly
before
me
pleading
expressive
of
agonized
despair
arose
the
sweet
face
of
dorothy
fairfax
nothing
else
counted
with
me
at
that
moment
but
her
safety
the
protecting
her
from
the
touch
of
that
brute
yet
how
and
through
what
means
could
such
rescue
be
accomplished
no
doubt
by
this
time
all
was
over
the
dead
body
of
sanchez
discovered
the
projected
attack
on
the
house
carried
out
the
two
old
men
left
behind
either
dead
or
severely
wounded
and
the
girl
borne
off
a
helpless
prisoner
together
with
the
treasure
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
even
if
i
knew
where
the
drifting
boat
had
taken
me
which
way
to
turn
to
once
again
attain
the
wharf
the
probability
remained
that
i
should
arrive
altogether
too
late
to
be
of
slightest
service
the
dastardly
deed
had
already
been
accomplished
ay
but
this
i
knew
there
was
only
one
place
to
which
the
villains
might
flee
with
their
booty
the
of
only
on
those
decks
and
well
at
sea
would
they
be
safe
or
able
to
enjoy
their
spoils
the
thought
came
to
me
in
sudden
revelation
why
not
was
not
here
a
chance
even
yet
to
foil
them
with
sanchez
dead
no
man
aboard
that
pirate
craft
would
recognize
me
i
felt
assured
of
this
i
had
fought
the
giant
negro
in
the
dark
he
could
not
during
that
fierce
encounter
have
distinguished
my
features
any
more
clearly
than
i
had
his
own
there
was
no
one
else
to
fear
although
i
had
been
stationed
at
the
wheel
of
the
sloop
as
we
swept
past
the
while
at
anchor
the
day
before
yet
estada
watching
anxiously
for
the
secret
signal
of
his
chief
would
never
have
accorded
me
so
much
as
a
glance
his
interest
was
concentrated
elsewhere
and
in
all
probability
he
could
not
swear
whether
i
was
black
or
white
if
others
of
that
devilish
crew
had
been
secretly
watching
our
deck
it
was
with
no
thought
of
me
and
not
one
of
them
would
retain
any
memory
of
my
appearance
if
only
i
might
once
succeed
in
getting
safely
aboard
slightly
disguised
perhaps
and
mingle
unnoticed
among
the
crew
the
chances
were
not
bad
for
me
to
pass
undetected
no
doubt
they
were
a
heterogeneous
bunch
drawn
from
every
breed
and
race
and
in
no
small
force
either
for
their
trade
was
not
so
much
seamanship
as
rapine
and
fighting
such
ships
carried
large
crews
and
were
constantly
changing
in
personnel
a
strange
face
appearing
among
them
need
not
arouse
undue
suspicion
from
what
estada
had
reported
to
sanchez
i
knew
boats
had
been
sent
ashore
on
this
coast
what
more
likely
then
than
that
some
new
recruit
had
returned
to
the
bark
attracted
by
a
sailor
tale
who
would
know
how
the
stranger
came
among
them
or
question
his
presence
unless
suspicion
became
aroused
even
if
questioned
a
good
story
easily
told
might
win
the
trick
before
daylight
came
and
already
well
at
sea
beyond
pursuit
inconspicuous
among
the
others
accepted
as
mate
by
the
men
unrecognized
even
by
the
officers
there
was
scarcely
a
probability
that
anyone
aboard
would
note
or
question
my
presence
and
i
felt
convinced
i
could
locate
the
ay
even
in
that
darkness
i
could
find
the
bark
if
the
vessel
yet
swung
at
her
former
anchorage
the
task
would
not
even
be
a
difficult
one
the
stars
gave
me
the
compass
points
and
i
recalled
with
some
clearness
the
general
trend
of
the
coast
line
as
we
came
up
but
could
i
hope
to
attain
the
ship
in
advance
of
the
returning
party
of
raiders
to
succeed
in
my
object
this
must
be
done
because
the
moment
these
reached
the
deck
the
bark
would
hastily
depart
for
the
open
sea
and
if
i
was
to
accomplish
this
end
it
must
be
attempted
at
once
the
call
to
action
the
possibility
of
thus
being
of
service
to
dorothy
seemed
instantly
to
awaken
all
my
dormant
energies
the
painful
chafing
of
my
wounds
was
forgotten
while
new
strength
returned
miraculously
to
my
bruised
body
god
helping
me
i
would
try
my
brain
throbbed
with
fresh
resolution
the
call
to
action
there
were
oars
in
the
boat
i
had
noticed
these
dumbly
before
but
now
i
drew
them
eagerly
forth
from
the
bottom
and
quickly
fitted
them
into
the
oarlocks
they
were
stout
ashen
blades
unusually
large
for
the
craft
in
which
they
had
been
stowed
yet
workable
the
boat
itself
was
a
mere
shell
scarcely
capable
of
sustaining
safely
more
than
three
persons
but
with
lines
of
speed
its
sharp
prow
cutting
the
water
like
a
knife
blade
i
shipped
the
useless
rudder
inboard
and
chose
my
course
from
the
stars
the
north
star
was
completely
obscured
by
thick
clouds
but
the
great
dipper
gave
me
my
bearings
with
sufficient
accuracy
to
attain
again
to
the
west
coast
not
far
from
where
the
great
point
projected
outward
into
the
bay
and
behind
which
the
bark
swung
at
anchor
required
according
to
my
understanding
of
our
present
position
that
i
head
the
boat
toward
the
southwest
i
bent
earnestly
to
the
oars
and
the
speed
of
the
craft
was
most
encouraging
especially
as
my
strength
and
energy
seemed
to
increase
with
each
stroke
my
mind
brightened
also
quite
perceptibly
as
the
violent
exercise
sent
the
blood
coursing
anew
through
my
veins
before
i
realized
the
change
i
had
become
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
course
i
had
chosen
was
the
wisest
one
possible
it
was
wild
and
desperate
to
be
sure
i
was
not
blind
to
its
danger
and
yet
nothing
else
offered
any
solution
the
only
probable
chance
now
for
me
to
prove
of
direct
service
to
the
captive
girl
lay
in
being
near
her
while
she
remained
with
these
men
if
by
any
good
fortune
she
had
thus
far
succeeded
in
escaping
from
estada
and
his
gang
of
ruffians
i
would
learn
this
fact
more
surely
aboard
the
than
in
any
other
way
and
once
assured
as
to
this
could
certainly
find
some
means
of
early
escape
from
the
ship
while
if
she
was
captured
and
taken
aboard
as
was
most
probable
for
me
to
be
left
behind
on
shore
would
mean
her
total
abandonment
better
any
risk
of
discovery
than
that
to
be
sure
i
had
no
plan
of
action
devised
no
conception
of
how
a
rescue
could
be
effected
yet
such
an
opportunity
might
develop
and
my
one
hope
lay
in
being
prepared
and
ready
with
the
death
of
sanchez
his
second
in
command
would
undoubtedly
succeed
him
but
would
that
be
estada
or
would
it
be
this
other
the
mulatto
francois
levere
more
likely
the
former
for
while
buccaneers
had
operated
under
colored
chiefs
a
crew
of
white
men
would
naturally
prefer
to
be
led
by
one
of
their
own
color
indeed
it
was
even
possible
that
a
controversy
might
arise
and
a
divided
authority
result
discipline
among
such
as
these
depended
entirely
on
strength
and
ferocity
the
most
daring
and
resourceful
became
the
chosen
leaders
whose
only
test
was
success
perhaps
in
the
turmoil
and
uncertainty
arising
from
a
knowledge
of
sanchez
death
and
the
jealousy
thus
aroused
between
those
who
would
succeed
him
in
command
i
might
discover
the
very
opportunity
i
sought
these
were
some
of
the
thoughts
which
animated
me
and
gave
new
strength
to
my
arms
as
i
sent
the
dory
flying
through
the
water
my
boat
unguided
had
drifted
considerably
farther
out
into
the
bay
than
i
had
supposed
and
it
required
a
good
half
hour
of
steady
toil
at
the
oars
before
i
sighted
ahead
of
me
the
darker
outlines
of
the
shore
nothing
had
crossed
our
path
and
no
unusual
sound
had
reached
my
ears
along
the
black
water
if
the
boat
had
already
returned
to
the
bark
its
passage
must
have
been
made
during
the
period
of
my
unconsciousness
and
this
seemed
to
me
utterly
impossible
the
course
i
had
followed
thus
far
took
me
directly
across
the
water
which
they
would
be
compelled
to
traverse
and
they
could
not
have
passed
unnoticed
no
they
were
surely
yet
in
the
neighborhood
of
travers
plantation
the
men
engaged
in
that
bloody
business
would
have
been
compelled
to
carry
it
out
under
many
obstacles
they
would
be
delayed
by
consternation
at
the
discovery
of
their
dead
leader
lying
on
the
sand
and
by
their
lack
of
knowledge
regarding
the
interior
of
the
house
on
the
summit
of
the
bluff
quite
likely
also
this
lack
of
a
guide
would
result
in
an
alarm
and
consequent
struggle
perhaps
even
in
the
serious
injury
of
some
among
them
before
they
secured
possession
of
the
money
and
the
girl
in
any
case
it
must
have
resulted
in
delay
convinced
of
this
and
confident
that
i
was
already
well
in
advance
of
them
i
drew
in
as
closely
as
i
dared
to
the
dim
outline
of
shore
and
studied
it
carefully
in
an
endeavor
to
learn
my
exact
position
although
the
sloop
in
its
voyage
up
the
bay
had
never
been
out
of
sight
of
this
coast
had
indeed
skirted
it
closely
all
the
way
yet
my
memory
of
its
more
prominent
landmarks
was
extremely
vague
i
had
made
no
effort
to
impress
them
on
my
mind
therefore
at
first
i
could
identify
nothing
but
finally
out
of
the
grotesque
shifting
shadows
dimly
appearing
against
the
slightly
lighter
sky
beyond
there
suddenly
arose
clearly
defined
the
gaunt
limbs
of
a
dead
tree
bearing
a
faint
resemblance
to
a
gigantic
cross
i
recalled
that
sam
had
chanced
to
point
this
out
to
me
on
our
upward
voyage
and
this
glimpse
obtained
of
it
again
now
told
me
exactly
where
i
had
made
shore
this
peculiar
mark
was
at
the
extremity
of
the
first
headland
lying
north
of
the
point
itself
and
consequently
a
straight
course
across
the
bay
would
land
me
within
five
hundred
yards
of
where
the
had
last
been
seen
at
anchor
to
a
degree
my
immediate
plan
of
action
had
been
definitely
mapped
out
within
my
own
mind
while
toiling
at
the
oars
at
least
i
had
arrived
at
certain
conclusions
the
one
immediate
object
before
me
was
to
attain
the
bark
in
advance
of
estada
i
now
was
convinced
that
thus
far
i
was
safely
ahead
the
night
wind
was
light
and
baffling
not
greatly
affecting
my
own
progress
but
of
a
nature
to
retard
considerably
the
and
compel
a
series
of
wide
tacks
so
as
to
enable
those
on
board
to
round
the
point
all
this
distance
i
could
avoid
by
beaching
my
dory
and
striking
out
on
foot
directly
across
the
narrow
neck
of
land
the
unless
her
position
had
been
changed
since
darkness
set
in
was
not
so
far
out
from
shore
as
to
make
swimming
to
her
a
dangerous
feat
and
i
could
approach
and
board
her
with
far
less
chance
of
discovery
in
that
manner
than
by
the
use
of
a
boat
the
watch
on
deck
would
undoubtedly
be
a
vigilant
one
yet
no
eye
could
detect
through
that
darkness
unless
by
sheer
accident
a
submerged
swimmer
cautiously
advancing
with
silent
strokes
the
greater
danger
would
come
after
i
had
attained
the
deck
wet
to
the
skin
the
sharp
bow
of
the
dory
ran
up
on
the
soft
sand
of
the
beach
and
i
stepped
ashore
hauling
the
light
boat
after
me
beyond
the
reach
of
the
waves
the
night
remained
calm
and
still
although
the
scudding
clouds
were
thickening
overhead
until
scarcely
a
single
star
remained
visible
the
sea
behind
me
was
overhung
by
a
black
curtain
yet
by
bending
low
i
could
look
along
the
surface
for
some
distance
where
the
heaving
water
reflected
from
wave
to
wave
what
little
light
there
was
the
beach
was
a
narrow
one
and
only
a
few
feet
away
the
neck
of
land
became
elevated
into
a
leveled
crest
thickly
covered
with
trees
their
upper
branches
dimly
visible
from
where
i
stood
judging
from
the
trend
of
the
coast
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
strike
directly
across
to
the
opposite
shore
but
in
this
journey
special
caution
was
not
required
there
would
be
no
one
in
the
midst
of
this
desolate
region
to
interfere
with
my
progress
or
be
alarmed
by
any
noise
i
might
make
close
to
shore
as
the
lay
no
ordinary
sound
from
the
land
could
be
heard
aboard
even
in
the
silence
of
night
nor
was
it
likely
the
crew
would
be
watchful
in
that
direction
unquestionably
the
entire
attention
of
the
deck
watch
at
this
hour
would
be
concentrated
on
the
expected
return
of
their
expedition
around
the
distant
point
seeking
the
glimpse
of
a
white
sail
above
the
black
water
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
the
bark
floated
with
bow
pointing
toward
the
open
sea
the
sweep
of
the
current
about
the
point
was
inshore
making
the
drift
of
the
vessel
strong
against
the
anchor
hawser
this
would
naturally
bring
her
with
broadside
to
the
eastward
from
which
direction
the
absent
boat
must
return
if
this
proved
correct
then
in
all
probability
the
deck
watch
would
largely
be
gathered
on
that
side
even
the
attention
of
the
officer
more
or
less
drawn
in
that
direction
no
doubt
they
had
orders
to
be
ready
for
instant
departure
the
moment
the
approaching
boat
was
sighted
and
the
lookout
for
it
would
be
keen
it
was
as
i
stood
there
revolving
these
matters
in
my
mind
with
eyes
endeavoring
to
pierce
the
surrounding
darkness
and
ears
strained
to
detect
the
slightest
sound
that
there
came
to
me
the
first
real
consciousness
of
the
reckless
nature
of
this
adventure
upon
which
i
had
so
lightly
embarked
surely
it
was
but
the
dream
of
a
crazed
man
foredoomed
to
failure
as
i
faced
then
the
probabilities
there
scarcely
seemed
one
chance
in
a
hundred
that
any
such
scheme
as
i
proposed
would
succeed
and
yet
i
must
admit
there
was
the
one
chance
and
in
no
other
action
could
i
perceive
even
that
much
encouragement
if
dorothy
fairfax
was
already
in
the
hands
of
these
men
then
my
only
opportunity
for
serving
her
lay
in
my
being
close
at
hand
no
alternative
presented
itself
no
other
effort
could
be
effective
it
was
already
too
late
to
attempt
the
organization
of
a
rescue
party
there
was
no
warship
on
the
coast
and
the
authorities
of
the
colony
possessed
no
vessel
fitted
for
pursuit
long
before
daylight
came
or
i
might
hope
to
spread
an
alarm
abroad
the
would
be
safely
at
sea
no
the
only
choice
left
was
for
me
either
to
accompany
the
girl
or
else
abandon
her
entirely
to
her
captors
i
must
either
face
the
possibility
of
discovery
and
capture
which
as
surely
meant
torture
and
death
or
otherwise
play
the
coward
and
remain
impotently
behind
there
was
no
safe
course
to
pursue
i
believed
that
i
could
play
my
part
among
the
crew
once
securely
established
among
them
that
i
could
succeed
in
escaping
recognition
even
on
the
part
of
cochose
if
this
was
true
then
to
a
stout
heart
and
ready
hand
a
way
might
open
even
aboard
the
bark
to
protect
her
from
the
final
closing
of
the
devil
jaws
i
had
nothing
to
risk
but
my
life
and
it
had
never
been
my
nature
to
count
odds
i
would
act
as
the
heart
bade
and
so
i
drove
the
temptation
to
falter
away
and
strode
on
up
the
bank
into
the
black
shadow
of
the
trees
i
found
extremely
hard
walking
as
i
advanced
through
tangled
underbrush
over
unlevel
ground
the
night
so
dark
in
those
shadows
i
could
but
barely
perceive
the
outlines
of
a
hand
held
before
the
eyes
fortunately
the
distance
was
even
shorter
than
i
had
anticipated
but
when
i
finally
emerged
upon
the
opposite
beach
it
was
at
once
quite
evident
that
the
sea
beating
upon
the
sand
was
decidedly
heavier
than
higher
up
the
bay
the
white
line
of
breakers
showing
conspicuously
even
in
the
night
while
their
continuous
roar
sounded
loud
through
the
silence
it
was
not
until
after
i
had
advanced
cautiously
into
the
water
and
then
stooped
low
to
thus
gain
clearer
vision
along
the
surface
that
i
succeeded
in
locating
the
vessel
sought
even
then
the
appeared
only
as
a
mere
shadow
without
so
much
as
a
light
showing
aboard
yet
apparently
anchored
in
the
same
position
as
when
we
had
swept
past
the
previous
afternoon
the
slightly
brighter
sky
above
served
to
reveal
the
tracery
of
bare
poles
while
the
hull
was
no
more
than
a
blot
in
the
gloom
utterly
shapeless
and
appearing
to
be
much
farther
away
than
it
was
in
reality
indeed
as
the
sky
gradually
darkened
the
entire
vision
vanished
as
though
it
had
been
one
of
those
strange
mirages
i
had
seen
in
the
african
deserts
yet
i
knew
with
certainty
the
ship
was
there
had
sufficient
time
in
which
to
mark
its
position
accurately
and
rejoiced
at
the
increase
of
darkness
to
conceal
my
approach
guided
by
this
memory
i
waded
straight
out
through
the
lines
of
surf
until
all
excepting
the
head
became
completely
submerged
if
i
was
to
reach
the
bark
at
all
this
was
the
one
opportunity
i
stood
there
resisting
the
undertow
tugging
at
my
limbs
and
barely
able
to
retain
my
footing
intent
upon
my
purpose
full
strength
had
come
back
to
my
muscles
and
my
head
was
again
clear
the
imminent
sense
of
danger
seemed
to
bring
me
a
feeling
of
happiness
of
new
confidence
in
myself
the
die
was
cast
and
whatever
the
result
i
was
going
ahead
to
accomplish
all
that
was
humanly
possible
from
now
on
there
was
to
be
no
doubting
no
turning
back
a
voice
echoed
to
me
across
the
water
reaching
my
ears
a
mere
thread
of
sound
the
words
indistinguishable
it
must
have
been
an
order
for
a
moment
later
i
distinguished
the
clank
of
capstan
bars
as
though
men
of
the
crew
were
engaged
in
warping
the
vessel
off
shore
for
greater
safety
the
movement
was
too
deliberate
and
noiseless
to
mean
the
lifting
of
the
anchor
nor
was
it
accompanied
by
any
flapping
of
sail
or
shifting
of
yards
to
denote
departure
nevertheless
even
this
movement
decided
me
to
delay
my
attempt
no
longer
and
with
strong
silent
strokes
i
swam
forward
directly
breasting
the
force
of
the
incoming
sea
yet
making
fair
progress
some
unconsidered
current
must
have
swept
me
to
the
right
for
when
the
outlines
of
the
bark
again
became
dimly
visible
through
the
night
i
found
myself
well
to
starboard
of
the
vessel
and
quite
likely
would
have
passed
it
by
altogether
but
for
the
sudden
rattle
of
a
block
aloft
causing
me
to
glance
in
that
direction
as
my
eyes
explored
the
darkness
yet
uncertain
that
i
really
beheld
the
a
light
flared
for
a
brief
instant
and
i
had
glimpse
of
a
face
illumined
by
the
yellow
glare
as
the
single
spark
of
flame
ignited
a
cigarette
it
was
all
over
with
so
swiftly
swallowed
up
in
that
blackness
as
to
seem
a
vision
of
imagination
yet
i
knew
it
to
be
real
stroking
well
under
water
and
with
only
my
eyes
exposed
above
the
surface
i
changed
my
course
to
the
left
and
slowly
and
cautiously
drew
in
toward
the
starboard
bow
a
few
moments
later
unperceived
from
above
and
protected
from
observation
by
the
bulge
of
the
overhang
and
density
of
shadow
my
hands
clung
to
the
anchor
hawser
my
mind
busy
in
devising
some
means
for
attaining
the
deck
chapter
x
on
the
deck
of
the
namur
it
was
here
that
fortune
favored
me
strengthening
my
decision
and
yielding
a
fresh
courage
to
persevere
the
pounding
of
the
seas
against
the
bow
rendered
other
sounds
for
the
moment
unnoticeable
while
the
current
swept
so
strongly
against
my
submerged
body
as
to
compel
me
to
cling
tightly
to
the
swaying
rope
to
prevent
being
overcome
close
as
i
was
the
bark
appeared
scarcely
more
than
a
dense
shadow
swaying
above
me
without
special
form
and
unrevealed
by
the
slightest
gleam
of
light
merely
a
vast
bulk
towering
between
sea
and
sky
forking
out
however
directly
over
where
i
clung
desperately
to
the
wet
hawser
my
eyes
were
able
to
trace
the
a
massive
bit
of
timber
with
ropes
faintly
traced
against
the
sky
the
rather
loosely
furled
jib
flapping
ragged
edges
in
the
gusts
of
wind
suddenly
as
i
stared
upward
i
became
aware
that
two
men
were
working
their
way
out
along
the
and
as
they
reached
a
point
almost
directly
over
my
head
became
busily
engaged
in
tightening
the
gaskets
to
better
secure
the
loosening
sail
the
foot
of
one
slipped
and
he
hung
dangling
giving
vent
to
a
stiff
english
oath
before
he
succeeded
in
hauling
himself
back
to
safety
the
other
indulged
in
a
chuckling
laugh
yet
was
careful
not
to
speak
loudly
had
one
drink
too
many
tom
he
asked
that
will
pay
yer
fer
finishin
the
bottle
an
never
givin
me
another
sup
the
other
growled
evidently
not
in
any
too
good
humor
after
his
mishap
you

so
easy
thet

the
real
thing
haines
laughed
again
working
carelessly
as
the
men
advanced
along
the
spar
i
could
distinguish
their
forms
more
clearly
that
wus
part
o
the

tom
he
acknowledged
his
accent
that
of

cockney
did
yer
git

on
thet

feller

so
we
pulled

the
feller
cuddled
up
in
the

almighty
long
finding
out
his
job
an
the
way
he
started
in
fer
ter
the
cuss
wus
worth
seein
it
was
so
damn
dark
thar
by
the
foremast
i
could
tell
whut
did
happen
but
it
wus
fists
mostly
till
the
mate
drove
the
poor
devil
cussin
like
mad
over
agin
the
rail
an
then
heaved
him
out
inter
the
water
i
heerd
the
feller
splash
when
he
struck
but
he
never
let
out
no
yell
what
did
levere
do
him
hell
he
did
do
nuthin
just
stared
down
over
the
rail
a
bit
an
then
cum
back
rubbin
his
hands
never
even
asked
who
the
feller
wus
thar
ai
nuthin
kin
skeer
that
black
brute
by
god

tom
sanchez
do
stand
fer
thet
talk
an
he
back
o
levere
let
go
in
them
gaskets
will
hold
all
right
now
cum
the
two
vaguely
distinguishable
figures
disappeared
clambering
awkwardly
over
the
rail
and
as
instantly
vanishing
into
the
blackness
of
the
bark
deck
an
unsecured
bit
of
canvas
continued
to
flap
noisily
above
me
and
the
constant
surge
of
water
pounded
against
the
bow
but
i
could
perceive
now
clearly
the
character
i
was
destined
to
assume
when
once
safely
aboard
the
such
an
assumption
would
involve
but
slight
danger
of
discovery
it
was
as
though
a
miracle
had
opened
the
way
revealed
to
me
by
the
unconscious
lips
of
these
two
gossiping
sailors
the
story
told
fitted
my
necessities
exactly
had
i
planned
the
circumstances
myself
nothing
could
have
been
better
prearranged
no
one
on
board
had
seen
the
missing
man
by
daylight
if
an
impression
of
his
features
remained
in
any
individual
mind
it
must
be
extremely
vague
and
valueless
bill
conviction
that
the
man
was
english
and
probably
a
sailor
was
the
most
definite
and
he
had
had
greater
opportunity
closely
to
observe
the
stranger
than
anyone
else
levere
had
obtained
no
more
than
a
glimpse
of
his
opponent
during
their
struggle
in
the
dark
and
while
fighting
for
his
life
surely
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
obscure
any
faint
impression
thus
acquired
and
the
fellow
had
been
heartlessly
flung
overboard
was
believed
to
have
sunk
without
a
struggle
too
drunk
to
save
himself
was
scarcely
given
another
thought
yet
no
one
knew
positively
that
this
was
so
because
no
one
cared
the
death
of
the
lad
had
simply
been
taken
for
granted
when
levere
failed
to
see
his
body
rise
again
to
the
surface
yet
it
was
quite
within
the
realm
of
possibility
for
the
fellow
to
come
up
once
more
in
that
darkness
beyond
levere
range
of
vision
and
even
to
have
remained
afloat
buoyed
up
by
clinging
to
the
anchor
hawser
until
strong
enough
to
return
on
board
at
least
there
was
no
one
aboard
the
able
to
deny
that
this
had
been
done
satisfied
by
this
reasoning
of
being
able
to
pass
myself
off
as
the
dead
man
with
small
danger
of
detection
and
likewise
assured
so
far
at
least
as
eyes
and
ears
testified
that
none
of
the
crew
were
grouped
on
the
forecastle
to
be
attracted
by
my
movements
i
began
slowly
and
cautiously
to
drag
myself
up
the
taut
hawser
hoping
thus
to
attain
a
position
from
which
to
gain
on
the
rail
and
thus
attain
the
deck
unseen
while
my
explanation
might
suffice
i
greatly
preferred
having
to
present
it
only
as
a
last
resort
i
would
much
rather
slip
quietly
aboard
and
mingle
unnoticed
with
the
crew
for
the
next
few
hours
than
be
haled
at
once
before
levere
and
endure
his
scrutiny
and
possible
violence
the
fellow
was
evidently
a
brute
and
a
hard
master
seemingly
i
had
chosen
a
fortunate
moment
for
my
effort
no
one
heeded
the
little
noise
i
made
and
when
i
finally
topped
the
rail
and
was
able
to
look
inboard
it
was
to
discover
a
deserted
fore
deck
with
the
watch
all
engaged
at
some
task
amidships
there
was
no
gleam
of
light
but
i
could
hear
the
patter
of
feet
and
imagined
seeing
dim
moving
figures
a
rather
voice
was
giving
orders
and
enough
of
his
words
reached
me
to
convince
that
other
men
were
aloft
on
the
main
yard
believing
my
best
policy
would
be
to
join
those
busied
on
deck
just
as
though
i
belonged
among
them
i
crept
down
the
forecastle
ladder
and
worked
my
way
aft
beneath
the
black
shadow
of
the
port
rail
until
able
thus
to
drift
unnoticed
into
a
group
tailing
on
to
a
mainsail
halliard
the
fellow
next
to
me
without
releasing
his
grip
turned
his
head
and
stared
but
without
discerning
my
features
whar
the
hell
did
yer
cum
frum
he
growled
and
i
as
instantly
recognized
bill
haines
been
sojerin
have
yer
well
now
damn
yer
eyes
lay
too
an
pull
before
i
could
attempt
an
answer
a
tall
figure
loomed
up
before
us
the
same
voice
i
had
noticed
previously
calling
out
sharply
there
that
enough
men
now
make
fast
we
can
head
the
old
girl
out
from
here
in
a
jiffy
if
it
really
begins
to
blow
jose
you
stand
by
at
the
wheel
in
case
you
needed
some
of
the
rest
ship
the
capstan
bars
and
remain
near
for
a
call
discipline
on
board
must
have
been
somewhat
lax
or
else
haines
held
some
minor
official
position
which
gave
him
unusual
privilege
for
while
the
others
instantly
separated
to
carry
out
these
orders
he
remained
motionless
confronting
the
man
i
supposed
to
be
the
mulatto
levere
my
own
position
was
such
i
could
not
press
past
the
two
without
attracting
attention
what
are
ye
swingin
the
yards
fer
enyhow
asked
the
sailor
insolently
just
fer
exercise
the
other
who
already
had
started
to
turn
away
stopped
and
took
a
step
backward
toward
his
questioner
because
i
am
a
sailor
haines
he
replied
angrily
anyhow
it
is
none
of
your
business
i
was
left
in
command
here
those
clouds
look
good
to
me
there
is
going
to
be
a
blow
before
morning
then
it
yer
intention
ter
work
this
yere
berth
it
my
intention
to
be
ready
if
it
becomes
necessary
there
is
no
regular
officer
left
aboard
but
just
the
same
i
am
not
going
to
let
this
bark
pile
up
on
those
rocks
yonder
we
hang
on
here
for
another
half
hour
maybe
and
then
if
the
do
show
up
we
work
further
off
shore
until
daylight
that
sensible
it
haines
growled
something
inaudible
to
me
but
evidently
accepted
as
an
assent
and
levere
still
in
no
good
humor
from
the
questioning
wheeled
sharply
about
to
go
forward
this
movement
placed
him
face
to
face
with
me
what
are
you
loafing
here
for
he
burst
forth
no
doubt
glad
to
thus
vent
his
anger
on
someone
who
the
hell
are
you
joe
gates
sir
i
answered
quickly
mouthing
the
first
name
which
came
to
my
lips
gates
joe
gates
peering
savagely
into
my
face
but
unable
to
distinguish
the
features
i
never
heard
of
anybody
on
board
by
that
name
who
is
the
fellow
haines
the
englishman
gripped
me
by
the
sleeve
to
whirl
me
about
but
as
his
fingers
touched
the
soaked
cloth
of
my
jacket
he
burst
forth
with
an
oath
by
god
but
he
wet
enough
to
be
the
same
lad
you
chucked
overboard
an
hour
ago
damn
me
i
believe
he
is
say
mate
are
you
the
gay
buck
we
hauled
aboard
drunk
and
dumped
inter
the
i
dunno

i
answered
dumbly
believing
it
best
not
to
remember
too
much
i
could
even
tell
yer
whut
ship
this
is
ner
how
i
signed
on

seem
ter
remember

wus
ashore
frum

schooner
but
this
yere

a
bark

convinced
of
my
identity
and
considering
it
a
good
joke
well
my
buck

tell
yer
whar

are
an
likewise
how

chuckled
i

one
of
a
party

drunk
as

in
with
a
savage
snarl
what

that

is
the
same
damned
scamp
who
tried
to
stick

remained
motionless
a
mere
shadow
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
thet
sir
i
confessed
respectfully
if
things
happened
as
you
say
they
did
i
have
any
memory
o
ter
slash
nobody
leastwise
i
seemed
ter
know
whut
i
wus
about
when
i
cum
up

do
remember
how
i
got
ther
furst
i
knew
i

tryin
ter

so
blame

got
grip
on
a
hawser
an
hung
on
till
i
got
back
strength
ter
clime
on
board
i
knew
this
my
ship
so
i
just
lay
quiet
awhile
figurin
out
whar
i
wus
yer
english
born
in
bristol

but
i
wus
workin
on
the
she

the
question

ter
take
a
chance
with
us

the
only
life
lad
plenty
of
fun
the
best
of
liquor
and
pretty
girls
with
a
share
in
all
the
swag
what
is
the
name
of
this
bark
the
sailed
out
o
rotterdam
till
we
took
her
whut
wus
yer
in
when
ye
took
her
the
a
schooner
the
fastest
thing
afloat
she
south
in
west
india
waters
who
the
captain
silva
sanchez
gawd

so
yer
heerd
o
sanchez
well
we
with
him
all
right
mate
an
yer
ought
ter
know
whut
thet
means
fer
a
good
man
i
hesitated
yet
only
long
enough
to
leave
the
impression
i
sought
to
make
on
them
both
likely
thar
ai
no
sailor
but
whut
has
heerd
o
him
i
said
slowly
enyhow
i
sure
have
i
ca
say
thet
i
have
any
special
hankerin
after
bein
a
pirate
an
i
never
aimed
ter
be
one
but
seem
as
how
i
am
yere
on
this
bark
an
ca
easy
get
away
it
look
like
thar
wus
much
choice
does
it
levere
appeared
amused
in
his
way
which
was
not
a
pleasant
one
oh
yes
friend
there
is
choice
enough
bill
here
had
exactly
the
same
choice
when
he
first
came
hey
bill
remember
how
you
signed
on
after
we
took
you
off
the
this
is
how
it
stands
gates
either
go
forrard
quietly
yerself
er
the
both
of
us
will
kick
you
there
we
never
give
an
order
twice
on
the
that
will
be
enough
talk
if
you
do
your
work
all
right
and
if
you
do
then
look
out
my
man
there
will
be
plenty
of
hell
waiting
for
you
go
on
now
it
was
a
curt
dismissal
coupled
with
a
plain
threat
easy
to
understand
i
obeyed
the
order
gladly
enough
slinking
away
into
the
black
shadows
forward
realizing
my
good
fortune
and
seeking
some
spot
where
i
could
be
alone
the
result
was
all
that
i
could
have
hoped
for
my
position
on
board
was
assured
my
story
had
been
accepted
without
awakening
the
slightest
suspicion
and
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
no
one
on
board
the
possessed
the
slightest
memory
of
the
personal
appearance
of
the
poor
fellow
who
had
been
thrown
overboard
and
drowned
even
haines
believed
me
to
be
the
man
of
course
i
should
be
watched
to
some
extent
for
a
few
days
my
willingness
to
serve
noted
and
my
ability
as
a
seaman
put
to
the
test
but
in
this
i
had
nothing
to
fear
i
could
play
the
assumed
character
with
little
danger
of
any
mishap
the
only
remaining
peril
of
discovery
would
come
with
the
return
of
the
absent
boat
and
the
necessity
of
my
encountering
the
giant
negro
yet
i
was
convinced
even
this
would
not
prove
serious
if
cochose
had
glimpsed
my
features
at
all
during
the
course
of
our
desperate
struggle
on
the
deck
of
the
sloop
the
impression
made
on
his
mind
must
have
been
merely
momentary
and
besides
he
would
never
once
conceive
it
possible
that
the
same
man
could
have
reached
the
bark
ahead
of
his
return
even
if
such
a
suspicion
dawned
i
was
now
in
a
position
to
positively
establish
my
arrival
aboard
the
early
the
evening
previous
and
before
their
expedition
had
departed
i
felt
so
safe
and
so
content
with
my
success
thus
far
as
to
already
believe
thoroughly
in
the
final
result
of
my
mission
this
confidence
developed
almost
into
sheer
recklessness
there
were
some
difficulties
ahead
to
be
sure
i
remained
sane
enough
to
recognize
these
yet
i
had
already
conquered
easily
what
at
first
had
appeared
insurmountable
and
in
consequence
of
this
good
luck
these
others
yet
to
be
met
seemed
far
less
serious
the
same
happy
fortune
which
had
opened
the
way
for
me
to
board
the
must
also
intervene
to
aid
me
in
solving
future
problems
mine
was
the
philosophy
of
a
sailor
to
whom
peril
was
but
a
part
of
life
all
i
seemed
to
require
now
was
a
sufficiency
of
courage
and
faith
the
opportunity
would
be
given
in
this
spirit
of
aroused
hope
i
continued
to
stare
out
into
the
black
night
watchfully
the
shrouded
deck
behind
me
silent
and
seemingly
deserted
except
for
the
steady
tramp
from
rail
to
rail
of
levere
keeping
his
lonely
watch
aft
the
crew
had
disappeared
lying
down
no
doubt
in
corners
out
of
the
wind
and
this
wind
was
certainly
rising
already
attaining
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
for
the
boom
of
waves
hurled
against
the
bows
of
the
laboring
bark
was
steadily
becoming
more
noticeable
while
overhead
the
ropes
sang
dismally
i
wondered
that
levere
hung
on
so
long
in
his
perilous
position
although
in
spite
of
the
increased
strain
the
anchor
still
clung
firmly
quite
probably
he
had
received
stern
orders
not
to
shift
from
his
present
position
until
the
boat
returned
yet
surely
his
judgment
as
a
competent
seaman
left
in
command
must
make
him
aware
of
the
threatening
danger
he
would
never
wreck
his
vessel
merely
because
he
had
been
instructed
to
remain
at
that
particular
spot
it
seemed
to
me
that
no
hawser
ever
made
could
long
withstand
the
terrific
strain
of
our
tugging
as
the
struggling
bark
rose
and
fell
in
the
grip
of
the
sea
to
him
must
have
come
the
same
conviction
for
suddenly
his
voice
sang
out
from
the
poop
stand
by
forrard
to
lower
the
starboard
anchor
move
lively

non

see
nottings
well
do
go
to
sleep
keep
both
eyes
open
i
had
already
joined
the
watch
forward
aware
only
of
the
numerous
dim
and
shapeless
figures
about
me
busily
employed
in
straightening
out
the
kinks
in
the
heavy
cable
the
number
of
men
on
deck
was
evidence
of
a
large
crew
there
being
many
more
than
were
necessary
for
the
work
to
be
done
most
of
them
appeared
to
be
able
seamen
and
haines
drove
them
mercilessly
cursing
them
for
lubbers
and
twice
kicking
viciously
at
a
stooping
form
there
was
no
talking
only
the
growl
of
an
occasional
oath
the
slapping
of
the
hawser
on
deck
and
the
sharp
orders
of
haines
then
the
great
rope
began
to
slip
swiftly
through
the
hawse
hole
and
we
heard
the
sharp
splash
as
the
iron
flukes
struck
the
water
and
sank
almost
at
that
same
instant
the
voice
of
cavere
rang
out
from
the
a
sail
a
sail
where
away
off
ze
port
quarter
i
make

just

ze
point
chapter
xi
the
return
of
the
boat
receiving
no
other
orders
the
moment
all
was
secure
the
crew
eager
to
welcome
back
the
boat
party
and
learn
the
news
hurried
over
to
the
port
rail
beyond
doubt
most
of
those
aboard
realized
that
this
had
been
an
expedition
of
some
importance
the
culmination
of
their
long
wait
on
the
coast
part
of
some
scheme
of
their
chief
in
the
spoils
of
which
they
expected
to
share
it
was
for
this
end
they
had
been
inactive
for
weeks
hiding
and
skulking
along
shore
now
they
hoped
to
reap
their
reward
in
gold
and
silver
and
then
be
permitted
to
return
to
the
wilder
more
adventurous
life
they
loved
on
the
high
seas
moreover
this
boat
approaching
through
the
darkness
was
bringing
back
their
leader
and
however
else
they
might
feel
toward
him
the
reckless
daring
and
audacious
resourcefulness
of
sanchez
meant
success
these
fellows
the
scum
of
the
seven
seas
whom
he
had
gathered
about
him
might
hate
and
fear
yet
were
glad
to
follow
they
had
learned
on
many
a
bloody
deck
the
merit
of
their
chief
and
in
their
way
were
loyal
to
him
i
was
made
to
comprehend
all
this
by
the
low
muttered
utterances
of
those
crowding
near
me
spoken
in
nearly
every
language
of
the
world
much
i
could
not
even
translate
yet
enough
reached
my
ears
to
convince
me
of
the
temper
of
the
crew
their
feverish
eagerness
to
be
again
at
sea
under
command
of
a
captain
whom
they
both
hated
and
feared
yet
whom
they
would
follow
to
the
very
gates
of
hell
even
as
they
cursed
him
with
hot
oaths
in
memory
of
some
act
of
discipline
there
came
into
their
voices
a
tinge
of
admiration
which
furnished
me
an
accurate
etching
of
the
man
they
knew
him
these
of
the
sea
and
from
out
their
mouths
i
knew
him
also
for
what
he
was
a
cruel
monster
yet
a
genius
in
crime
and
a
natural
leader
of
such
men
as
these
sanchez
all
the
unspeakable
horror
which
in
the
past
had
clung
to
that
name
came
back
again
to
haunt
me
i
seemed
to
hear
once
more
the
tales
of
men
who
had
escaped
from
his
grip
alive
to
see
again
the
scenes
they
had
witnessed
it
could
not
seem
possible
that
i
was
actually
upon
one
of
his
ships
in
the
very
midst
of
his
wild
crew
i
listened
to
their
comments
their
expectations
with
swiftly
beating
heart
i
alone
knew
what
that
boat
was
bringing
and
when
it
arrived
and
they
knew
also
what
would
these
sea
wolves
say
what
would
they
do
what
would
be
the
result
when
the
dead
body
of
their
leader
came
up
over
the
rail
for
a
few
moments
we
could
perceive
nothing
through
the
black
night
the
clouds
were
rolling
low
thickened
by
vapor
and
the
increasing
wind
had
already
beaten
the
waves
into
crests
of
foam
we
could
hear
them
crash
against
the
stout
sides
of
the
bark
which
leaped
to
their
impetus
yet
was
held
in
helpless
captivity
by
the
two
anchors
the
deck
under
foot
tossed
dizzily
the
bare
masts
swaying
above
while
our
ears
could
distinguish
the
sullen
roar
of
breakers
tumbling
up
on
the
sand
just
astern
overhead
ropes
rattled
noisily
the
sound
mingling
with
the
flapping
ends
of
loosened
sails
beating
against
the
yards
levere
shouted
an
order
and
a
sudden
flare
was
lighted
amidships
the
circle
of
flame
illumining
a
part
of
the
deck
and
spreading
out
over
the
wild
expanse
of
water
the
seaman
holding
the
blazing
torch
aloft
and
thrusting
it
forth
across
the
rail
took
on
the
appearance
of
a
black
statue
as
motionless
as
though
carved
from
ebony
while
in
the
gleam
the
various
groups
of
men
became
visible
lined
up
along
the
port
bulwarks
all
staring
in
the
one
direction
eagerly
seeking
a
first
glimpse
of
the
approaching
craft
scarcely
had
a
minute
elapsed
before
it
came
sweeping
into
the
radius
of
light
at
first
a
dim
spectral
shadow
scarcely
to
be
recognized
then
almost
as
suddenly
revealed
in
all
its
details
a
boat
of
size
flying
toward
us
under
a
lug
sail
standing
out
hard
as
a
board
keeling
well
over
and
topping
the
sea
swells
like
a
bird
on
wing
was
a
beautiful
sight
as
the
craft
came
sweeping
on
before
the
full
weight
of
the
wind
out
from
that
background
of
gloom
into
the
yellow
glare
of
the
torch
circling
widely
so
as
to
more
safely
approach
the
bark
quarter
levere
called
for
men
to
stand
by
the
fellows
rushing
past
me
to
their
stations
but
in
the
fascination
of
the
moment
i
failed
to
move
i
could
do
nothing
but
stare
out
across
the
intervening
water
with
eyes
fastened
on
that
swiftly
approaching
boat
i
must
see
i
must
know
the
message
it
brought
what
story
it
held
of
the
tragedy
at
first
i
could
only
barely
distinguish
the
figures
of
those
aboard
yet
these
gradually
assumed
recognizable
form
and
finally
the
faces
also
became
dimly
visible
manuel
held
the
tiller
with
estada
seated
beside
him
leaning
forward
and
gesticulating
with
one
hand
as
he
directed
the
course
i
had
never
seen
these
two
yet
i
knew
them
beyond
a
doubt
mendez
and
anderson
at
least
i
supposed
these
to
be
the
two
were
poised
at
the
sail
halliards
ready
to
let
the
straining
sheet
down
at
a
run
while
cochose
crouched
low
in
the
bow
his
black
hand
uplifted
gripping
a
coil
of
rope
their
faces
were
all
turned
forward
lighted
by
the
flare
from
our
deck
and
i
felt
a
shudder
of
fear
run
over
me
no
expression
on
any
countenance
spoke
of
defeat
even
the
ugly
features
of
the
negro
beamed
with
delight
but
was
that
all
was
that
all
surely
not
yet
the
boat
had
to
leap
forward
and
then
turn
broadside
too
as
it
swept
aft
toward
the
main
chains
before
i
succeeded
in
seeing
what
remained
partially
concealed
between
the
thwarts
in
its
bottom
forward
of
the
single
mast
was
stowed
the
chest
which
travers
slaves
had
borne
with
such
care
up
the
bluff
while
in
the
open
space
between
the
helmsman
and
the
two
sailors
were
stretched
two
motionless
bodies
levere
gripping
a
and
leaning
well
out
hailed
in
spanish
ahoy
the
boat
there
is
not
too
much
sea
you
can
make
it
ay
came
back
estada
voice
swept
aside
by
the
wind
yet
still
audible
stand
by
to
fend
us
off
call
all
hands
and
break
anchor
as
soon
as
we
are
aboard
very
well
sir
where
is
captain
sanchez
estada
pointed
downward
in
swift
expressive
gesture
here
at
my
feet
badly
hurt
but
will
recover
send
two
men
down
to
help
when
we
make
fast
now
cochose
let
go
of
your
rope
watch
out
above
i
stood
gripping
hard
at
the
rail
and
staring
down
at
the
scene
below
as
the
men
in
the
boat
made
fast
i
felt
paralyzed
and
helpless
unable
to
move
i
had
no
business
to
remain
there
every
prospect
of
security
depended
on
my
joining
the
crew
but
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
desert
my
position
i
could
hear
the
hurrying
feet
of
the
watch
tramping
across
the
deck
in
response
to
levere
orders
the
heavy
pounding
of
a
on
the
forecastle
hatch
as
haines
called
for
all
hands
i
was
aware
that
men
were
already
mounting
the
ratlines
and
laying
out
on
the
upper
yards
to
make
sail
while
the
capstan
bars
began
rattling
yet
only
one
thought
gripped
me
was
not
i
had
believed
he
was
i
had
staked
all
on
his
death
as
a
certainty
but
instead
the
man
was
lying
there
in
the
boat
helpless
at
present
sorely
wounded
perhaps
yet
still
alive
estada
even
said
he
would
surely
recover
and
that
other
body
that
of
dorothy
fairfax
without
doubt
yet
certainly
not
lifeless
those
fellows
would
surely
never
bring
back
to
the
the
useless
dead
form
of
one
of
their
victims
that
was
unthinkable
impossible
if
their
prisoner
was
the
girl
and
who
else
could
it
be
she
remained
alive
helplessly
bound
to
prevent
either
struggle
or
outcry
and
destined
to
a
fate
far
worse
than
death
this
revelation
struck
me
like
a
blow
i
had
anticipated
the
possible
capture
of
the
young
woman
but
not
the
return
of
sanchez
his
living
overthrew
all
my
plans
there
was
no
hope
in
the
narrow
confines
of
the
ship
for
me
to
remain
long
out
of
his
sight
once
he
became
able
again
to
reach
the
deck
and
he
would
instantly
recognize
me
in
any
guise
every
hope
of
rescue
had
vanished
every
faith
that
i
could
be
of
aid
my
own
life
hung
in
the
balance
nay
rather
my
doom
was
already
sealed
there
seemingly
was
but
one
chance
for
escape
left
that
was
to
drop
silently
overboard
amid
the
confusion
of
getting
under
way
and
make
the
desperate
attempt
to
reach
shore
unseen
before
the
crew
could
lift
anchor
and
set
sail
this
possibility
came
to
me
yet
i
continued
to
cling
there
dazed
and
helpless
staring
dully
down
lacking
both
physical
and
mental
energy
to
put
the
wild
scheme
into
execution
god
no
that
would
be
the
craven
act
of
a
coward
better
far
to
stay
and
kill
or
even
be
killed
than
to
be
forever
cursed
by
my
own
conscience
the
fellow
might
die
some
fatal
accident
befall
the
why
a
hundred
things
might
occur
before
sanchez
was
capable
of
resuming
command
or
could
attempt
any
serious
injury
to
dorothy
the
fellows
sent
down
from
the
main
chains
to
the
boat
brought
the
injured
captain
up
first
this
required
the
services
of
three
men
his
body
hanging
limp
between
them
his
upturned
face
showing
ghastly
in
the
flaming
of
the
torch
thrust
out
over
the
rail
to
every
appearance
it
was
apparently
a
corpse
they
handled
except
for
their
tenderness
and
a
single
groan
to
which
the
white
lips
gave
utterance
when
one
of
the
bearers
slipped
wrenching
the
wounded
body
with
a
sharp
pang
of
pain
once
safely
on
deck
the
three
bore
him
across
to
the
after
cabin
in
which
a
swinging
lantern
had
been
lighted
and
was
by
then
burning
brightly
and
disappeared
down
the
steps
my
eyes
followed
every
movement
as
i
forgot
for
the
instant
the
boat
and
its
occupants
still
tossing
alongside
on
the
waters
below
as
i
turned
back
awakened
by
some
cry
i
saw
that
estada
had
already
swung
himself
up
into
the
chains
while
anderson
and
mendez
were
lifting
the
girl
to
her
feet
and
rather
roughly
urging
her
forward
her
hands
and
limbs
had
been
set
free
but
she
swayed
back
and
forth
in
the
grasp
of
the
two
men
as
though
unable
to
support
herself
alone
her
face
upturned
into
the
flare
of
light
as
she
gazed
in
terror
at
the
black
side
of
the
bark
towering
above
her
eyes
reflected
all
the
unutterable
horror
which
for
the
moment
dominated
her
mind
while
her
loosened
hair
disarranged
by
struggle
only
served
to
intensify
the
pallor
of
her
face
yet
in
spite
of
this
evident
despair
there
was
still
strength
and
defiance
in
the
firm
closing
of
her
lips
and
her
efforts
to
stand
alone
uncontaminated
by
the
touch
of
the
sailors
hands
hustle
her
along
lively
boys
shouted
back
estada
coarsely
if
she
wo
move
give
her
a
shove
then
tie
her
up
again
and
take
the
turn
of
a
rope
her
what
do
you
think
this
is
a
queen
reception
move
lively
senorita
in
mock
sarcasm
her
gaze
settled
on
him
where
he
hung
far
out
grasping
a
backstay
watching
the
movements
below
and
her
slender
form
straightened
as
by
the
acquisition
of
new
strength
if
these
creatures
will
take
their
hands
off
me
she
said
using
their
tongue
without
a
tremor
in
the
clear
voice
i
can
easily
go
up
alone
what
is
it
you
are
so
afraid
of
a
woman
the
expression
of
estada
face
promised
an
outburst
of
profanity
but
instead
of
giving
it
utterance
he
lifted
his
cap
in
a
sudden
pretense
at
gallantry
your
pardon
senorita
he
said
in
a
tone
of
humble
mockery
if
you
have
come
to
your
senses
at
last
it
is
well
no
one
can
be
happier
than
i
leave
her
alone
men
now
my
beauty
i
am
taking
you
at
your
own
word
a
step
and
then
the
protection
of
my
hand
we
welcome
you
as
a
guest
aboard
a
moment
and
she
had
attained
the
deck
where
she
stood
i
could
no
longer
see
her
face
yet
she
remained
there
silent
and
motionless
rather
stiffly
erect
as
she
faced
him
frightened
and
helpless
as
she
was
yet
her
very
posture
seemed
to
express
the
detestation
she
felt
for
the
man
but
estada
apparently
pleased
with
his
performance
thus
far
chose
to
continue
playing
the
fool
thanks
senorita
thanks
he
began
softly
and
again
bowing
before
her
cap
in
hand
we
greet
you
with
due
honor
aboard
the
enough
of
that
you
coward
you
murderer
she
broke
in
coldly
do
not
touch
nor
speak
to
me
she
turned
her
back
on
him
thus
coming
face
to
face
with
levere
who
stood
enjoying
the
scene
a
wide
grin
on
his
dark
face
revealing
a
row
of
white
teeth
under
a
moustache
you
sir
you
are
an
officer
i
have
charge
of
the
deck
then
where
am
i
to
go
the
mulatto
surprised
by
the
sudden
question
glanced
inquiringly
toward
estada
who
had
already
completely
lost
his
sense
of
humor
go
the
latter
growled
where
is
she
to
go
why
send
the
wench
below
i
see
to
her
later
and
teach
her
who
is
the
master
here
she
will
not
queen
it
long
on
these
decks
i
warrant
you
off
with
her
now
but
be
back
quickly
he
leaned
out
over
the
rail
sending
his
gruff
voice
below
send
up
that
chest
you
men
careful
now
not
to
let
it
drop
overboard
yes
that
better
hook
on
the
boat
manuel
and
let
her
drag
we
must
get
out
of
here
in
a
hurry
all
ready
aloft
ay
ay
sir
then
sheet
home
how
is
it
forrard
both
anchors
apeak
sir
smartly
done
hard
down
with
your
helm
there
that
it
now
let
her
play
off
slowly
he
must
have
caught
sight
of
me
through
the
gloom
for
he
strode
furiously
forward
giving
utterance
to
a
bristling
spanish
oath
all
the
savage
brutality
of
his
nature
had
been
brought
to
the
surface
by
dorothy
stinging
words
and
he
sought
now
some
fit
opportunity
to
give
it
vent
before
i
could
move
he
had
gripped
me
by
the
collar
and
swung
me
about
so
that
the
light
streaming
out
from
the
cabin
fell
directly
on
my
face
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
loafing
aft
here
he
demanded
roughly
staring
into
my
eyes
did
you
hear
the
orders
you
damned
shirker
i
seen
you
hanging
about
for
ten
minutes
never
lifting
a
hand
who
the
hell
are
you
anyhow
the
captain
joe
gates
sir
gates
another
damned
englishman
how
did
you
ever
get
aboard
here
it
was
the
returning
levere
who
made
explanation
before
i
could
reply
manuel
brought
him
on
board
last
night
picked
him
up
drunk
ashore
estada
ugly
eyes
roved
from
face
to
face
as
though
he
failed
to
fully
comprehend
well
does
he
imagine
he
is
going
to
be
a
passenger
why
has
he
been
taught
his
place
before
this
it
about
time
levere
for
this
drunken
sailor
to
be
given
a
lesson
to
last
him
for
awhile
and
by
god
if
you
wo
do
it
i
will
step
over
here
gates
i
took
the
necessary
step
forward
and
faced
him
expecting
the
rabid
tongue
lashing
which
i
rather
felt
i
deserved
now
my
man
do
you
know
what
this
bark
is
i
think
so
sir
mister
levere
explained
that
to
me
oh
he
did
well
he
must
have
failed
to
make
clear
the
fact
that
we
enforce
discipline
aboard
the
next
time
you
neglect
to
jump
at
an
order
you
are
going
to
taste
the
cat
you
understand
me
you
speak
spanish
yes
sir
i
lived
two
years
in
cuba
i
see
well
now
do
you
happen
to
have
any
idea
who
i
am
no
sir
only
that
you
are
one
of
the
officers
then
i
will
enforce
the
information
on
your
mind
so
that
you
are
not
liable
to
forget
also
the
fact
that
hereafter
you
are
to
jump
when
i
speak
i
am
the
first
officer
and
in
command
at
present
pedro
estada
is
my
name
now
you
damned
english
whelp
remember
that
before
i
even
suspected
what
was
coming
his
unexpected
action
as
swift
as
the
leap
of
a
poised
tiger
he
struck
me
fairly
between
the
eyes
with
the
butt
of
a
pistol
and
i
went
down
sprawling
onto
the
deck
for
a
moment
i
seemed
in
spite
of
the
viciousness
of
the
blow
to
retain
a
spark
of
consciousness
for
i
knew
he
kicked
me
savagely
with
his
heavy
sea
boots
i
felt
the
pain
and
even
heard
the
words
and
curses
accompanying
each
brutal
stroke
you
drunken
dog
you
whelp
of
a
sea
wolf
you
english
cur
take
that
damn
you
and
that
you
not
forget
me
for
awhile
it
squirm
i
like
to
see
it
when
you
wake
up
again
you
remember
pedro
estada
how
did
that
feel
you
grunting
pig
here
levere
manuel
throw
this
sot
into
the
forecastle
curse
you
here
is
one
more
to
jog
your
memory
the
heavy
boot
landed
full
in
my
face
and
every
sensation
left
me
as
i
sank
limply
back
bloody
and
unconscious
chapter
xii
a
friend
in
the
forecastle
i
slowly
and
regretfully
opened
my
eyes
aroused
perhaps
by
a
trampling
of
feet
on
the
deck
above
to
find
myself
lying
in
an
upper
bunk
of
the
forecastle
i
was
partially
covered
by
a
ragged
blanket
but
for
a
few
moments
remained
unable
to
comprehend
the
situation
yet
the
vivid
memory
soon
returned
stimulated
no
doubt
by
the
continuous
aching
of
my
body
where
estada
had
so
brutally
kicked
me
with
his
heavy
boots
the
first
recollection
of
that
assault
brought
with
it
a
dull
anger
strangely
commingled
with
a
thought
of
dorothy
fairfax
and
a
sense
of
my
own
duty
the
heavy
rolling
of
the
bark
clearly
evidenced
that
we
were
already
at
sea
and
bucking
against
a
high
wind
occasionally
a
monster
wave
broke
over
the
and
struck
thunderingly
on
the
deck
above
me
the
whole
vessel
trembling
to
the
shock
oilskins
hung
to
the
deck
beams
swung
here
and
there
at
strange
angles
while
the
single
slush
lantern
dangled
back
and
forth
like
the
pendulum
of
a
clock
it
was
a
dark
dismal
smelly
interior
amply
large
enough
but
ill
ventilated
and
inexpressibly
dirty
every
stench
under
heaven
seemed
to
assail
my
nostrils
so
compounded
together
as
to
be
separately
indistinguishable
although
that
of
stale
bilge
water
strongly
predominated
the
only
semblance
of
fresh
air
found
entrance
through
the
small
square
scuttle
hole
attainable
by
means
of
a
short
ladder
and
staring
up
at
this
i
was
able
to
perceive
the
light
of
day
although
so
little
penetrated
below
the
swaying
slush
light
alone
served
to
illumine
the
place
and
render
its
horrors
visible
it
was
day
then
and
we
were
well
out
at
sea
i
must
have
been
lying
unconscious
for
several
hours
in
all
probability
finding
it
impossible
to
arouse
me
the
brutes
had
finally
left
me
alone
to
either
recover
or
die
as
fate
willed
i
rested
back
feeling
of
the
numerous
bruises
on
my
body
and
touching
gingerly
the
dried
blood
caked
on
my
face
no
very
serious
damage
seemed
to
have
been
done
for
i
could
move
without
great
pain
although
every
muscle
and
tendon
appeared
to
be
strained
and
lacerated
my
head
had
cleared
also
from
its
earlier
sensation
of
dullness
the
brain
actively
taking
up
its
work
clinching
my
teeth
to
keep
back
a
groan
i
succeeded
in
sitting
upright
my
head
touching
the
upper
deck
as
i
undertook
to
survey
my
surroundings
they
were
gloomy
and
dismal
enough
the
forecastle
in
true
dutch
style
had
been
built
directly
into
the
bows
so
that
the
bunks
arranged
three
tiers
high
formed
a
complete
half
circle
the
single
lantern
flickering
and
flaring
as
it
swung
constantly
to
the
sharp
pitching
of
the
vessel
cast
grotesque
shadows
and
failed
entirely
to
penetrate
the
corners
the
deck
below
me
was
littered
with
chests
sea
boots
and
odds
and
ends
of
clothing
while
farther
aft
considerable
water
had
found
entrance
through
the
scuttle
hole
and
was
slushing
back
and
forth
as
the
bark
rolled
about
half
the
bunks
seemed
to
be
occupied
the
figures
of
the
sleeping
men
barely
discernible
although
their
heavy
breathing
evidenced
their
presence
and
added
to
the
babel
of
sound
every
bolt
and
beam
creaked
and
groaned
in
the
ceaseless
struggle
with
the
sea
the
bunk
in
which
i
had
awakened
was
situated
almost
at
the
apex
of
the
half
circle
so
that
i
had
a
clear
view
of
the
wider
open
space
those
beneath
me
contained
no
occupants
nor
at
first
could
i
distinguish
any
in
the
tier
directly
opposite
evidently
the
watch
off
duty
preferred
to
seek
their
rest
as
far
away
as
possible
from
those
waves
pounding
against
the
bow
however
as
i
sat
there
staring
about
at
this
scene
and
uncertain
as
to
what
my
next
move
should
be
there
was
a
stir
within
the
upper
berth
on
my
own
level
and
a
moment
later
an
uplifted
face
appeared
suddenly
in
the
yellow
flare
of
light
it
was
manifestly
an
english
face
at
first
glance
rosy
of
cheek
with
chestnut
beard
and
light
tousled
hair
a
pair
of
humorous
gray
eyes
surveyed
me
silently
and
then
apparently
satisfied
by
the
scrutiny
the
owner
sat
up
in
the
bunk
revealing
powerful
shoulders
and
a
round
bull
neck
ahoy
mate
he
said
pleasantly
endeavoring
to
speak
low
the
effort
resembling
the
growl
of
a
bear
how
do
you
feel
pretty
sore
ache
from
head
to
foot
i
answered
immediately
feeling
his
friendliness
but
no
harm
done
i
saw
part
of
it
the
damn
black
brute
kicked
savagely
enough
but
at
that
you
lucky
it
the
spanish
style
to
use
a
knife
i
seen
that
cock
slash
a
man
into
ribbons
for
nothing
at
all
just
to
show
he
was
bad
haines
tells
me
your
name
is
gates
and
that
you
are
english
that
right
i
shipped
first
out
of
bristol
so
did
i
mate
twenty
years
ago
though
and
i
never
went
back
since
my
name
is
tom
watkins
let
shake
there
is
quite
a
sprinkling
of
us
britishers
aboard
and
we
ought
to
hang
together
he
put
out
a
big
hairy
fist
and
i
gripped
it
heartily
decidedly
liking
the
man
as
his
eyes
frankly
met
mine
he
appeared
honest
and
square
a
fine
type
of
the
english
seaman
tom
watkins
you
said
may
i
ask
if
you
were
out
on
the
along
with
haines
last
night
just
afore
the
come
in
yes
we
were
there
well
i
was
down
below
hanging
to
the
cable
and
overheard
you
two
talking
together
somehow
watkins
you
do
not
seem
to
me
to
fit
in
exactly
with
this
gang
of
pirates
you
do
look
to
be
that
sort
how
long
have
you
been
with
them
he
glanced
about
warily
lowering
his
voice
until
it
became
a
hoarse
whisper
three
years
mate
and
most
of
that
time
has
been
hell
i
even
been
ashore
but
once
and
that
was
on
an
island
these
fellows
do
put
any
trust
in
my
kind
nor
give
them
any
chance
to
cut
and
run
once
in
awhile
a
lad
does
get
away
but
most
of
them
are
caught
and
those
that
are
sure
get
their
punishment
they
never
try
it
again
i
seen
them
staked
out
on
the
sand
and
left
to
die
that
ai
no
nice
thing
to
remember
but
how
did
you
come
into
it
like
most
of
the
rest
i
was
second
mate
of
the
a
glasgow
brig
we
loaded
with
sugar
at
martinique
for
london
these
fellows
overhauled
us
at
daybreak
about
a
hundred
miles
off
the
east
end
of
cuba
they
had
a
swift
schooner
and
five
guns
one
a
long
tom
all
we
had
to
fight
them
with
was
about
fifteen
men
and
two
brass
carronades
our
skipper
was
scotch
and
he
put
up
some
fight
but
it
was
any
use
there
was
only
three
of
us
left
alive
when
the
pirates
came
aboard
one
of
these
died
two
days
later
and
another
was
washed
overboard
and
drowned
down
in
the
gulf
i
am
all
that
is
left
of
the
you
saved
your
life
by
taking
on
sanchez
had
the
two
of
us
who
were
able
to
stand
back
in
his
cabin
he
put
it
to
us
straight
he
said
it
was
up
to
us
whether
we
signed
up
or
walked
the
plank
and
he
did
appear
to
care
a
damn
which
we
chose
the
devil
meant
it
too
for
he
was
raging
mad
at
getting
only
five
hundred
pounds
off
the
brig
well
jack
and
i
looked
at
each
other
and
then
we
signed
and
you
say
others
of
this
crew
have
been
obtained
in
the
same
manner
i
questioned
deeply
interested
and
perceiving
in
this
a
ray
of
hope
not
exactly
no
i
would
precisely
say
that
it
true
perhaps
that
most
of
the
britishers
were
forced
to
join
in
about
the
same
way
i
was
and
there
may
be
a
scandinavian
or
two
with
a
few
dutch
to
be
counted
in
that
list
but
the
most
of
these
cusses
are
pirates
from
choice
it
their
trade
and
they
like
it
sanchez
only
aims
to
keep
hold
of
a
few
good
men
because
he
has
got
to
have
sailors
but
most
of
his
crew
are
nothing
but
plain
where
does
he
find
them
where
why
the
west
indies
are
full
of
such
devils
been
breeding
them
down
there
for
two
hundred
years
and
niggers
creoles
portuguese
spanish
and
every
damned
mongrel
you
ever
heard
of
sanchez
himself
is
half
french
the
who
kicked
you
is
a
portugee
and
levere
is
more
nigger
than
anything
else
i
bet
there
is
a
hundred
rats
on
board
this
right
now
who
cut
your
throat
for
a
sovereign
and
never
so
much
as
think
of
it
again
a
hundred
is
there
that
many
aboard
a
hundred
an
thirty
all
told
most
o
bunk
amidships
not
sailormen
but
just
an
sea
wolves
yer
ought
ter
see
swarm
out
on
deck
like
hungry
rats
when
thar
a
fight
comin
it
all
they
good
fer
watkins
i
said
soberly
after
a
pause
during
which
he
spat
on
the
dirty
deck
to
thus
better
express
his
feelings
do
you
mean
to
say
that
in
three
years
you
had
no
chance
to
escape
no
opportunity
to
get
away
not
a
chance
mate
no
more
will
you
the
only
place
i
put
foot
ashore
has
been
porto
grande
where
we
run
in
to
refit
that
a
worse
hell
than
the
ship
itself
but
haines
goes
ashore
he
was
with
manuel
boat
yesterday
the
big
fellow
laughed
grimly
bill
rather
likes
the
job
an
they
know
it
he
a
boatswain
gets
a
big
share
of
the
swag
he
the
only
britisher
aboard
who
would
cut
and
run
in
a
minute
besides
he
got
a
girl
at
porto
grande
and
that
fellow
anderson
who
was
with
estada
the
lowest
kind
of
a
swede
cur
he
do
more
dirt
than
a
portugee
i
know
what
yer
thinkin
i
had
them
notions
too
when
i
come
aboard
gettin
all
the
decent
sort
tergether
and
takin
the
vessel
work
thar
ai
who
wud
risk
it
and
if
thar
wus
yer
could
get
tergether
sanchez
is
too
damn
smart
fer
thet
every
damn
rat
is
a
spy
i
ai
hed
no
such
talk
as
this
afore
in
six
months
gates
the
last
time
cost
me
twenty
lashes
at
the
is
there
any
chance
of
our
being
overheard
now
no
these
near
bunks
are
all
empty
an
the
damn
noise
drowns
our
voices
what
yer
have
in
your
mind
mate
only
this
watkins
i
got
to
do
something
and
believe
i
can
trust
you
you
are
a
square
english
seaman
probably
the
only
one
aboard
i
can
repose
confidence
in
i
do
blame
you
for
sticking
for
i
suppose
likely
i
do
the
same
if
i
was
in
your
case
but
i
ai
it
not
my
life
i
thinking
about
but
that
of
a
woman
he
stared
at
me
across
the
narrow
space
separating
our
bunks
the
shadows
from
the
swinging
lantern
giving
his
features
a
strange
expression
a
woman
hell
lad
not
the
one
brought
aboard
last
night
exactly
now
listen
i
going
to
tell
you
my
story
and
ask
your
help
do
you
know
what
estada

after
in
the
well

plenty
o
talk
the
cook

us
some
stories
he
heard
aft
an
we
knew
we
wus
driftin
along
the
coast
waitin
fer
sanchez
ter
cum
back
i
suppose
he
got
onto
some
english
gold
in
that
chest
they
slung
aboard
was
it
yes
that
was
the
main
object
my
name
is
not
gates
at
all
and
i
am
not
the
man
mendez
brought
aboard
drunk
and
who
was
thrown
over
the
rail
by
levere
that
fellow
was
drowned
well
by
god
i
am
geoffry
carlyle
an
english
skipper
there
has
been
a
revolution
in
england
in
which
i
became
involved
when
the
attempt
failed
i
was
taken
prisoner
and
deported
to
america
for
twenty
years
servitude
i
came
over
with
a
bunch
of
others
on
the
same
ship
with
sanchez
the
yes
there
was
a
rich
planter
and
his
niece
also
aboard
he
was
coming
home
with
a
chest
of
money
fifty
thousand
pounds
realized
from
a
big
sale
of
tobacco
in
london
and
the
young
woman
was
returning
from
attending
school
in
england
sanchez
was
aboard
to
gain
possession
of
both
watkins
nodded
too
deeply
interested
in
the
narrative
to
interrupt
he
pretended
to
be
of
the
spanish
nobility
an
officer
and
tried
all
the
way
over
to
make
love
to
this
dorothy
fairfax
he
got
along
all
right
with
the
uncle
and
was
invited
to
visit
him
but
the
girl
was
not
so
easy
he
must
have
had
it
all
planned
out
how
he
was
to
get
the
gold
fairfax
carried
that
was
what
the
was
waiting
for
and
when
he
found
that
the
young
woman
could
not
be
won
by
fair
means
he
decided
to
take
her
by
force
it
not
the
first
time
for
the
devil
but
how
did
you
happen
to
come
along
fairfax
bought
me
to
run
his
sloop
perhaps
it
was
the
girl
who
won
him
over
anyhow
this
arrangement
angered
sanchez
and
we
had
words
you
know
the
rest
or
at
least
the
main
facts
sanchez
and
the
boat
crew
held
rendezvous
at
the
first
landing
up
the
bay
it
was
prearranged
but
it
was
my
fortune
to
meet
the
captain
alone
on
shore
in
the
dark
where
we
fought
it
was
you
then
who
drove
the
knife
in
god
excitedly
but
i
would
give
ten
years
for
such
a
chance
ay
and
they
say
you
came
within
an
eighth
of
an
inch
of
sending
him
to
hell
i
knew
not
where
i
struck
was
a
death
struggle
in
the
dark
i
thought
him
dead
when
i
left
him
and
ran
to
warn
the
others
but
for
this
i
was
too
late
the
moment
i
set
foot
on
the
sloop
deck
it
was
to
close
in
battle
with
the
big
negro
cochose
he
saw
you
then
no
only
as
a
shape
he
can
have
no
better
memory
of
me
than
i
of
him
we
fought
as
demons
until
his
giant
strength
forced
me
over
the
rail
he
has
no
knowledge
that
i
ever
rose
again
and
then
what
oblivion
nothing
only
what
i
saw
in
the
return
of
the
boat
tells
me
what
followed
i
came
back
to
consciousness
in
a
small
dory
afloat
on
the
bay
with
but
one
thought
in
my
mind
to
save
the
girl
how
it
was
too
late
to
return
even
had
i
known
the
way
but
i
could
come
here
to
this
ship
so
here
i
came
but
how
in
advance
of
those
in
the
by
cutting
across
the
point
the
coast
to
the
north
is
a
wide
circle
besides
the
discovery
of
sanchez
sorely
wounded
left
the
others
without
a
leader
fairfax
and
his
niece
together
with
the
treasure
were
in
travers
house
at
top
of
the
bluff
they
had
to
carry
out
an
attack
there
which
probably
meant
more
fighting
what
really
happened
there
of
course
i
do
not
know
it
can
be
easily
imagined
said
watkins
soberly
estada
has
no
mercy
he
is
a
born
devil
i
have
seen
him
kill
just
for
the
pleasure
of
it
with
sanchez
to
avenge
he
would
be
an
unleashed
demon
but
it
is
not
the
fate
of
those
men
to
consider
now
it
is
what
will
befall
this
girl
prisoner
you
have
no
plan
none
to
become
a
member
of
the
crew
was
my
only
thought
but
i
must
act
if
at
all
before
the
captain
recovers
he
would
recognize
me
at
sight
you
will
aid
advise
me
the
sailor
sat
silent
the
former
expression
of
humor
in
his
face
vanished
that
is
easier
to
ask
than
answer
mate
he
admitted
finally
i
am
an
english
seaman
and
will
do
my
duty
but
so
far
as
i
can
see
there
is
no
plan
we
can
make
it
is
god
who
will
save
the
girl
if
she
is
to
be
saved
he
may
use
us
to
that
end
but
it
is
wholly
beyond
our
power
to
accomplish
it
alone
the
only
thing
i
can
do
is
to
sound
out
the
men
aboard
and
learn
just
what
we
can
expect
of
them
if
any
opportunity
to
act
comes
there
are
not
more
than
a
dozen
at
most
to
be
relied
upon
and
my
part
do
nothing
at
present
play
your
part
and
keep
quiet
if
you
can
let
her
know
of
your
presence
aboard
without
discovery
it
might
be
best
for
if
she
saw
you
suddenly
unprepared
she
might
say
or
do
something
to
betray
you
there
are
other
reasons
why
it
may
be
best
for
her
to
know
she
is
not
entirely
deserted
he
leaned
over
motioning
me
toward
him
until
his
lips
were
at
my
ear
it
may
not
prove
as
hopeless
as
it
appears
now
he
whispered
confidentially
i
helped
carry
sanchez
to
his
stateroom
and
washed
and
dressed
his
wound
there
is
no
surgeon
aboard
but
i
have
some
skill
in
such
matters
he
has
a
bad
cut
and
is
very
weak
from
loss
of
blood
the
question
of
our
success
hinges
on
pedro
estada
what
he
will
do
you
mean
yes
this
is
a
chance
which
i
happen
to
know
he
has
long
been
waiting
for
the
only
question
is
has
he
the
nerve
to
act
i
doubt
if
he
has
alone
but
levere
is
with
him
and
that
would
cut
the
throat
of
his
best
friend
you
understand
the
death
of
sanchez
would
make
estada
chief
the
two
men
hate
each
other
why
not
there
was
a
plan
before
which
failed
this
time
it
may
not
fail
but
i
interposed
in
that
case
what
would
the
crew
do
accept
estada
no
doubt
at
least
the
would
be
with
him
for
he
is
of
their
sort
all
they
care
for
is
blood
and
booty
but
sanchez
death
would
save
you
from
discovery
and
his
voice
still
lower
so
that
i
barely
distinguished
the
words
in
the
confusion
aboard
if
we
were
ready
the
might
be
so
disabled
as
to
compel
them
to
run
her
ashore
for
repairs
that
would
give
you
a
chance
if
once
we
reach
porto
grande
there
is
no
hope
a
pounded
on
the
scuttle
and
haines
voice
roared
down
port
watch
hustle
out
bullies
chapter
xiii
i
accept
a
proposal
i
went
on
deck
with
the
watch
and
mingled
with
them
forward
no
one
in
authority
took
any
particular
notice
of
me
and
i
was
permitted
to
take
hold
with
the
others
at
the
various
tasks
a
portuguese
boatswain
asked
me
who
i
was
and
later
reported
my
presence
to
levere
who
had
charge
of
the
deck
but
the
only
result
was
my
being
set
at
polishing
the
gun
mounted
on
the
forecastle
the
mulatto
did
not
come
forward
and
i
rejoiced
at
having
my
status
aboard
so
easily
settled
and
being
permitted
to
remain
in
the
same
watch
with
watkins
it
was
a
dull
gray
morning
the
gloominess
of
the
overhanging
clouds
reflected
in
the
water
men
on
lookout
were
stationed
in
the
and
on
the
heads
yet
the
sharpest
eyes
could
scarcely
see
beyond
a
half
mile
in
any
direction
the
sea
came
at
us
in
great
ocean
swells
but
the
stout
bark
fought
a
passage
through
them
shivering
with
each
blow
yet
driven
forward
on
her
course
by
sails
standing
hard
as
boards
in
the
sweep
of
the
steady
gale
two
men
struggled
at
the
wheel
and
there
were
times
when
levere
paused
in
his
promenade
from
rail
to
rail
to
give
them
a
helping
hand
his
anxiety
was
evidenced
by
his
hailing
the
every
few
moments
only
to
receive
each
time
the
same
response
the
mist
failed
to
lift
but
seemed
to
shut
us
in
more
closely
with
every
hour
the
wind
growing
continually
more
boisterous
but
levere
held
on
grimly
i
was
kept
at
the
guns
during
the
entire
time
of
our
watch
besides
the
long
tom
forward
a
vicious
piece
two
swivel
guns
were
on
each
side
completely
concealed
by
the
thick
bulwarks
and
to
be
fired
through
ports
so
ingeniously
closed
as
to
be
imperceptible
a
few
yards
away
all
these
pieces
of
ordnance
were
kept
covered
by
tarpaulin
so
that
at
a
little
distance
the
of
appeared
like
a
peaceful
dutch
trader
there
was
a
brass
carronade
at
the
stern
in
plain
view
and
so
mounted
as
to
be
swung
inboard
in
case
of
necessity
its
ugly
muzzle
could
thus
rake
the
deck
fore
and
aft
but
the
presence
of
such
a
piece
would
create
no
suspicion
in
those
days
when
every
ship
was
armed
for
defense
and
consequently
no
effort
was
made
for
its
concealment
i
was
busily
at
work
on
this
bit
of
ordnance
when
estada
came
on
deck
for
a
moment
after
staring
aloft
and
about
the
horizon
into
the
impenetrable
mist
he
joined
levere
at
the
port
rail
in
a
short
earnest
conversation
as
the
two
worthies
parted
the
fellow
chanced
to
observe
me
i
caught
the
quick
look
of
recognition
in
his
eyes
but
bent
to
my
work
as
though
indifferent
to
his
presence
yet
failed
to
escape
easily
you
must
be
a
pretty
tough
bird
gates
he
said
roughly
or
i
would
have
killed
you
last
night
i
had
the
mind
too
something
about
his
voice
and
manner
led
me
to
feel
that
in
spite
of
his
roughness
he
was
not
in
bad
humor
that
would
have
been
a
mistake
sir
i
answered
straightening
up
rag
in
hand
for
it
would
have
cost
you
a
good
seaman
hoila
they
are
easily
picked
up
one
more
or
less
counts
for
little
in
these
seas
he
looked
at
me
searchingly
for
the
first
time
perhaps
actually
noting
my
features
in
spite
of
my
dirty
disheveled
appearance
and
the
bruises
disfiguring
my
face
this
scrutiny
must
have
aroused
his
curiosity
why
do
you
say
that
my
man
he
questioned
sharply
you
were
before
the
mast
and
drifted
aboard
here
because
you
were
drunk
is
that
true
partially
yes
it
was
drink
that
put
me
before
the
mast
i
explained
rejoicing
in
his
mood
and
suddenly
hoping
such
a
statement
might
help
my
status
aboard
three
years
ago
i
was
skipper
on
my
own
vessel
it
was
rum
ruined
me
saint
christopher
do
you
mean
to
say
you
can
read
charts
and
take
observations
i
smiled
encouraged
by
his
surprise
and
the
change
in
his
tone
yes
sir
i
saw
ten
years
service
as
mate
what
was
your
last
ship
the
london
to
hong
kong
i
wrecked
her
off
cape
mendez
in
a
fog
i
was
drunk
below
and
it
cost
me
my
ticket
you
know
west
indian
waters
slightly
i
made
two
voyages
to
panama
and
one
to
havana
and
speak
spanish
a
little
bit
sir
as
you
see
i
learn
languages
easily
he
stared
straight
into
my
face
but
without
uttering
another
word
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
below
whether
or
not
i
had
made
an
impression
on
the
fellow
i
did
not
know
his
face
was
a
mask
perfectly
concealing
his
thought
that
he
had
appeared
interested
enough
to
question
me
had
in
it
a
measure
of
encouragement
he
would
surely
remember
and
sometime
he
might
have
occasion
to
make
use
of
me
at
least
i
would
no
longer
remain
in
his
mind
as
a
mere
foremast
hand
to
be
kicked
about
and
spoken
to
like
a
dog
i
went
back
to
my
polishing
of
brass
in
a
more
cheerful
mood
perhaps
this
would
prove
the
first
step
leading
to
my
greater
future
liberty
on
the
i
had
finished
my
labor
on
the
carronade
and
was
fastening
down
securely
the
tarpaulin
when
a
thin
fellow
with
a
face
crept
up
the
ladder
to
the
poop
and
shuffled
over
to
where
levere
was
gazing
out
over
the
rail
oblivious
to
his
approach
mister
levere
sir
he
spoke
apologetically
his
voice
no
more
than
a
wisp
of
sound
the
mulatto
wheeled
about
startled
oh
it
you
well
what
is
it
gunsaules
senor
estada
sir
he
wishes
to
see
a
sailor
named
gates
in
the
cabin
who
gates
oh
yes
the
new
man
he
swept
his
eyes
about
until
he
saw
me
gates
is
your
name
is
it
yes
sir
follow
the
steward
below
senor
estada
wishes
to
see
you
go
just
as
you
are
very
good
sir
is
this
the
steward
the
fellow
led
the
way
amusing
me
by
the
peculiar
manner
in
which
his
long
legs
clung
to
the
ladder
and
then
wobbled
about
on
the
rolling
deck
until
he
attained
the
protection
of
the
a
half
dozen
broad
uncarpeted
steps
led
down
into
the
after
cabin
which
was
plain
and
practically
without
furniture
except
for
a
bare
table
suspended
from
the
upper
beams
and
a
few
chairs
securely
resting
in
chocks
the
deck
was
bare
but
had
been
thoroughly
scrubbed
the
water
not
entirely
dried
and
forward
there
was
a
rack
of
small
arms
the
polished
steel
shining
in
the
gray
light
of
the
transom
overhead
the
dutch
character
of
the
bark
was
very
apparent
here
in
the
excessively
heavy
deck
beams
and
the
general
gloom
of
the
interior
finished
off
in
dark
wood
and
ornamented
with
carved
paneling
filled
with
wonderment
as
to
why
i
had
been
sent
for
i
halted
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
gazing
about
the
dreary
interior
surprised
at
its
positive
dinginess
there
were
evidently
six
staterooms
opening
on
the
main
cabin
and
these
must
be
little
more
than
boxes
to
judge
from
the
breadth
of
the
vessel
what
was
farther
aft
i
could
not
determine
because
of
a
lack
of
light
but
as
no
stern
ports
were
visible
it
was
to
be
assumed
that
this
gave
space
for
two
more
larger
staterooms
directly
astern
occupied
probably
by
the
captain
and
his
first
officer
there
was
no
one
in
the
main
cabin
although
a
cat
lay
asleep
on
one
of
the
chairs
and
after
a
moment
hesitancy
i
followed
the
beckoning
steward
who
rapped
with
his
knuckles
on
one
of
the
side
doors
estada
voice
answered
who
is
it
gunsaules
senor
i
have
with
me
the
sailor
open
the
door
and
let
him
in
i
would
see
him
here
come
inside
gates
his
eyes
surveyed
us
both
in
the
narrow
opening
that
will
be
all
juan
no
one
is
to
be
admitted
until
i
tell
you
and
be
well
for
you
to
remain
by
the
stairs
on
guard
you
understand
si
senor
another
thing
sternly
do
let
me
catch
you
listening
outside
the
door
if
i
do
god
have
mercy
on
you
si
senor
i
stepped
inside
doubtful
enough
of
what
all
this
might
mean
yet
quite
prepared
to
accept
of
any
chance
it
might
offer
gunsaules
closed
the
door
softly
but
i
had
already
visioned
the
apartment
in
all
its
details
it
was
small
and
nearly
square
a
swinging
lantern
in
the
center
a
single
bunk
on
one
side
and
a
small
table
on
the
other
screwed
to
the
wall
and
covered
with
charts
and
various
papers
a
few
books
were
upon
a
shelf
above
this
and
a
sea
chest
was
shoved
under
the
bunk
some
oilskins
together
with
a
suit
of
clothes
dangled
from
wooden
pins
while
the
only
other
furniture
consisted
of
a
chair
and
a
stool
the
round
port
stood
partly
open
and
through
it
i
could
see
the
gray
expanse
of
water
all
these
i
perceived
at
a
glance
but
the
instant
the
door
closed
behind
me
my
entire
attention
concentrated
on
estada
he
sat
upright
in
the
chair
gazing
straight
at
me
his
own
face
clearly
revealed
in
the
light
from
the
open
port
it
seemed
to
me
i
was
looking
at
the
man
for
the
first
time
and
it
was
not
a
pleasant
picture
his
face
was
swarthy
long
and
thin
with
hard
set
lips
under
a
long
intensely
black
moustache
his
cheeks
strangely
crisscrossed
by
lines
the
nose
was
large
distinctively
roman
yielding
him
a
hawklike
appearance
but
it
was
his
eyes
which
fascinated
me
they
were
dark
and
deeply
set
absolute
wells
of
cruelty
i
had
never
before
seen
such
eyes
in
the
face
of
a
human
being
they
were
beastly
devilish
i
could
feel
my
blood
chill
as
i
looked
into
their
depths
yet
i
held
myself
erect
and
waited
for
the
man
to
speak
it
seemed
a
long
delay
yet
doubtless
was
scarcely
more
than
a
moment
then
his
lips
curled
in
what
was
meant
to
be
a
smile
and
he
waved
his
hand
sit
down
on
the
stool
gates
have
you
any
knowledge
of
portuguese
none
whatever
sir
nor
do
i
english
so
we
shall
have
to
rely
on
the
language
of
spain
i
am
hardly
expert
in
that
i
explained
but
if
you
do
not
talk
too
fast
i
can
manage
fairly
well
i
shall
speak
simply
wait
a
moment
he
arose
stepped
quietly
to
the
door
and
glanced
out
returning
apparently
satisfied
i
do
trust
that
damned
steward
he
said
nor
as
a
matter
of
fact
anyone
else
wholly
he
paused
and
stared
at
me
then
added
i
never
had
any
faith
in
your
race
gates
but
am
inclined
to
use
you
i
do
not
know
any
special
reason
why
you
should
sir
no
more
do
i
every
englishman
i
ever
knew
was
a
liar
and
a
sneaking
poltroon
i
was
brought
up
to
hate
the
race
and
always
have
i
say
that
i
like
you
any
better
than
the
others
by
god
i
do
for
the
matter
of
that
but
just
now
you
can
be
useful
to
me
if
you
are
of
that
mind
this
is
a
business
proposition
and
it
makes
no
odds
if
we
hate
each
other
so
the
end
is
gained
how
does
that
sound
i
shifted
my
position
so
as
to
gain
a
clearer
view
of
his
face
i
was
still
wholly
at
sea
as
to
what
the
fellow
was
driving
at
yet
evidently
enough
he
was
in
earnest
it
was
my
part
to
find
out
not
altogether
bad
i
admitted
i
have
been
in
some
games
of
chance
before
i
thought
as
much
eagerly
and
money
has
the
same
chink
however
it
be
earned
you
could
use
some
if
i
had
any
to
use
after
a
sailor
has
been
drunk
there
is
not
apt
to
be
much
left
in
his
pockets
he
reached
across
into
the
upper
bunk
and
brought
forth
a
bottle
and
glass
placing
these
upon
the
table
at
his
elbow
have
a
drink
first
he
said
pouring
it
out
it
will
stiffen
your
nerve
thanks
no
senor
i
have
nerve
enough
and
once
i
start
that
sort
of
thing
there
is
no
stopping
take
it
yourself
and
then
tell
me
what
is
in
the
wind
i
will
gates
affecting
cordiality
although
i
somehow
felt
that
my
refusal
to
imbibe
had
aroused
a
faint
suspicion
in
his
mind
but
i
would
rather
you
would
show
yourself
a
good
fellow
i
like
to
see
a
man
take
his
liquor
and
hold
it
he
sat
down
the
emptied
glass
and
straightened
back
in
the
chair
his
eyes
searching
as
ever
the
fact
is
he
began
doubtfully
what
you
just
said
to
me
on
deck
chanced
to
be
of
interest
you
were
not
boasting
i
answered
your
questions
truthfully
if
that
is
what
you
mean
you
are
a
navigator
i
was
in
command
of
ships
for
four
years
senor
naturally
i
know
navigation
do
you
mind
if
i
test
you
not
in
the
least
although
it
will
have
to
be
in
english
as
i
do
not
know
the
spanish
sea
terms
let
that
go
then
i
will
soon
learn
if
you
have
lied
and
that
will
be
a
sorry
day
for
you
i
tell
you
gates
how
matters
stand
aboard
and
why
i
have
need
of
your
skill
then
you
may
take
your
choice
the
forecastle
or
the
cabin
you
invite
me
aft
senor
i
give
you
a
chance
to
move
your
dunnage
if
you
will
do
my
work
he
explained
seriously
listen
now
sanchez
has
been
badly
hurt
it
may
be
weeks
before
he
leaves
his
cabin
if
indeed
he
ever
does
that
leaves
me
in
command
with
but
one
officer
the
mulatto
levere
this
might
answer
to
take
us
safely
to
porto
grande
as
we
could
stand
watch
and
watch
but
francois
is
no
sailor
it
was
his
part
on
board
to
train
and
lead
the
fighting
men
he
can
not
navigate
saint
christopher
i
fear
to
leave
him
alone
in
charge
of
the
deck
while
i
snatch
an
hour
sleep
i
see
i
admitted
and
yourself
senor
you
are
a
seaman
he
hated
to
confess
yet
my
eyes
were
honest
and
met
his
squarely
enough
to
get
along
but
not
quite
sure
as
to
my
figures
i
have
taken
no
sights
except
as
we
came
north
on
this
trip
is
for
this
reason
i
need
you
but
you
will
play
me
no
smart
english
trick
my
man
or
i
have
you
by
the
heels
at
once
i
know
enough
to
verify
your
figures
i
thought
of
no
trick
estada
i
said
coldly
now
satisfied
as
to
his
purpose
and
confident
of
my
own
power
english
or
otherwise
it
is
well
we
understand
each
other
you
would
have
me
as
navigator
very
well
at
what
terms
his
eyes
seemed
to
narrow
and
become
darker
with
rating
as
first
officer
and
your
fair
proportion
of
all
spoils
you
mean
then
to
continue
the
course
to
attack
vessels
on
the
high
seas
why
not
sneeringly
are
you
too
for
that
sort
of
job
if
so
then
you
are
no
man
for
me
it
is
a
long
voyage
to
porto
grande
and
no
reason
why
we
should
hurry
home
the
welcome
there
will
be
better
if
we
bring
chests
of
gold
aboard
ay
and
the
thought
will
put
hope
into
the
hearts
of
the
crew
they
are
restless
now
from
long
waiting
but
captain
sanchez
you
have
no
surgeon
i
am
told
will
he
not
suffer
from
neglect
of
his
wound
suffer
no
more
than
under
a
leech
ashore
all
that
can
be
done
has
been
there
are
men
aboard
able
to
treat
any
ordinary
wound
his
was
a
clean
knife
thrust
which
has
been
washed
treated
with
lotion
and
bound
up
no
leech
could
do
more
and
my
quarters
will
they
be
aft
you
will
have
your
choice
of
those
at
port
come
now
have
you
an
answer
ready
i
would
be
a
fool
not
to
have
heartily
i
am
your
man
estada
chapter
xiv
i
warn
dorothy
the
portuguese
evidently
well
pleased
at
my
prompt
acceptance
of
his
proposal
talked
on
for
some
time
explaining
to
me
something
of
the
situation
aboard
the
and
pointing
out
what
he
believed
to
be
our
position
on
the
chart
i
asked
a
few
questions
although
i
paid
but
little
attention
to
what
he
said
my
mind
being
busied
with
searching
out
his
real
purpose
no
doubt
the
situation
was
very
nearly
as
he
described
it
to
be
levere
was
no
navigator
and
estada
himself
only
an
indifferent
one
yet
at
that
the
course
to
the
west
indies
was
not
a
long
one
and
if
the
portuguese
had
been
able
to
bring
the
bark
from
there
to
the
chesapeake
the
return
voyage
should
not
terrify
him
greatly
no
that
was
not
the
object
he
was
planning
to
keep
at
sea
to
waylay
and
attack
merchant
ships
and
then
after
a
successful
cruise
arrive
at
porto
grande
laden
with
spoils
and
hailed
as
a
great
leader
his
plan
was
to
dispose
of
sanchez
even
to
permit
the
spaniard
to
die
of
his
wounds
possibly
even
to
hasten
and
assure
that
death
by
some
secret
resort
to
violence
no
doubt
levere
was
also
concerned
in
the
conspiracy
and
would
profit
by
it
and
possibly
these
two
were
likewise
assured
of
the
cooperation
of
the
more
reckless
spirits
among
the
crew
i
remembered
what
watkins
had
whispered
to
me
forward
his
suspicions
of
them
both
he
had
been
right
already
the
fuse
was
being
laid
and
very
fortunately
i
happened
to
be
chosen
to
help
touch
it
off
the
chance
i
had
sought
blindly
was
being
plainly
revealed
it
was
evident
enough
however
that
estada
had
no
intention
of
trusting
me
immediately
with
his
real
motives
his
confidence
was
limited
and
his
instructions
related
altogether
to
mere
matters
of
ship
routine
i
asked
a
few
questions
and
twice
he
lied
coolly
but
i
dared
not
mention
the
girl
in
any
way
for
fear
that
even
a
casual
reference
to
her
presence
on
board
might
arouse
his
suspicions
of
my
interest
we
were
at
sea
and
my
presence
aft
gave
me
opportunity
to
observe
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
cabin
i
could
await
developments
but
i
was
becoming
wearied
by
the
man
i
understand
perfectly
senor
i
broke
in
at
last
impatiently
you
will
have
to
take
for
granted
that
i
can
enforce
sea
discipline
and
navigate
your
boat
to
whatever
part
of
the
ocean
you
desire
to
sail
all
i
need
is
your
orders
this
i
take
it
is
all
you
require
of
me
yes
i
plan
you
execute
very
good
now
about
myself
and
i
arose
to
my
feet
determined
to
close
the
interview
i
would
study
these
charts
and
figure
out
our
probable
position
by
dead
reckoning
there
is
little
chance
of
having
glimpse
of
the
sun
today
the
fog
out
there
grows
heavier
you
say
i
may
choose
any
stateroom
on
the
port
side
they
are
all
unoccupied
except
one
used
by
the
steward
as
a
storeroom
i
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
main
cabin
the
roll
of
charts
under
my
arm
the
place
was
deserted
and
with
a
glance
about
met
estada
eyes
observing
me
closely
he
did
wait
for
me
to
question
him
captain
sanchez
stateroom
is
aft
he
said
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
the
entire
width
of
the
bark
no
there
are
two
rooms
he
is
left
alone
jose
is
with
him
a
negro
with
a
knack
at
nursing
who
else
is
quartered
aft
here
he
ignored
the
one
thing
i
most
desired
to
learn
but
i
did
not
press
it
believing
i
knew
the
answer
already
levere
has
this
middle
stateroom
and
mendez
the
one
forward
what
rank
has
mendez
third
officer
and
carpenter
just
at
present
with
levere
required
on
deck
he
has
charge
of
the
men
below
the
crew
you
mean
not
the
working
crew
they
are
quartered
in
the
forecastle
and
are
largely
english
and
swede
but
we
have
to
carry
extra
men
who
bunk
amidships
to
fight
damn
mongrels
of
course
you
keep
them
below
all
through
the
voyage
they
are
allowed
on
deck
amidships
when
we
are
at
sea
but
are
not
encouraged
to
mingle
with
the
sailors
we
over
a
powder
magazine
all
the
time
gates
any
spark
might
set
it
off
i
opened
one
of
the
doors
opposite
and
glanced
within
the
interior
differed
but
little
from
that
of
the
stateroom
occupied
by
estada
except
it
was
minus
the
table
no
doubt
they
were
all
practically
alike
this
will
do
very
well
i
said
quietly
now
how
about
clothes
these
i
wear
look
rather
rough
for
the
new
job
i
send
you
the
steward
he
fix
you
out
from
the
we
always
well
supplied
i
was
glad
to
see
him
go
and
closed
the
door
on
him
with
a
sigh
of
relief
his
eyes
seemed
to
exercise
a
peculiar
influence
over
me
a
snakelike
charm
against
which
i
had
to
constantly
battle
i
threw
the
bundle
of
charts
into
the
upper
bunk
and
unscrewed
the
glass
of
the
port
to
gain
a
view
without
and
a
breath
of
fresh
air
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
a
small
vista
of
gray
sea
blending
into
the
gray
mist
and
the
waves
on
this
side
ran
so
high
i
was
compelled
to
close
the
port
to
keep
out
the
spray
i
sat
down
on
the
stool
staring
about
the
compartment
realizing
suddenly
how
well
fortune
had
served
my
cause
the
chance
to
impersonate
the
drunken
sailor
the
meeting
with
watkins
my
chance
words
to
estada
on
deck
and
now
this
translation
from
forecastle
to
cabin
it
had
all
occurred
so
quickly
almost
without
effort
on
my
part
i
could
do
little
but
wonder
what
strange
occurrence
would
be
next
what
indeed
was
there
for
me
to
do
except
to
await
developments
only
one
thing
occurred
to
me
i
must
discover
some
means
immediately
of
communicating
with
dorothy
fairfax
the
importance
of
this
could
not
be
overestimated
with
myself
quartered
aft
and
eating
in
the
cabin
we
were
bound
to
meet
sooner
or
later
and
the
girl
must
previously
be
warned
of
my
presence
aboard
or
in
her
first
surprise
at
the
recognition
i
should
be
instantly
betrayed
nothing
would
escape
estada
and
the
slightest
evidence
that
we
two
had
formerly
met
would
awaken
his
suspicion
my
only
hope
of
success
lay
in
my
ability
to
increase
his
faith
in
my
pledges
the
necessity
of
having
a
competent
navigator
aft
alone
accounted
for
my
promotion
the
portuguese
neither
liked
nor
trusted
me
he
hated
and
despised
my
race
he
would
have
me
watched
and
would
carefully
check
over
my
figures
i
should
be
compelled
to
serve
him
faithfully
and
without
arousing
the
slightest
question
in
his
mind
in
order
to
establish
myself
in
his
esteem
or
gain
any
real
freedom
aboard
yet
if
i
was
to
serve
the
girl
there
must
be
first
of
all
intelligent
cooperation
between
us
she
must
not
only
know
of
my
presence
on
the
but
also
the
purpose
actuating
me
i
had
reached
this
conclusion
when
a
light
hesitating
knock
sounded
on
the
door
who
is
there
the
steward
senor
with
your
clothes
bring
them
in
gunsaules
entered
the
garments
over
his
arm
and
shuffled
in
his
peculiar
gliding
manner
across
to
the
bunk
where
he
laid
out
the
pieces
carefully
one
by
one
evidently
proud
of
his
selection
quite
a
beautiful
piece
of
goods
senor
he
ventured
speaking
so
softly
i
could
barely
distinguish
the
words
above
the
crash
of
the
waves
on
the
ship
side
and
most
excellently
tailored
i
do
not
remember
whether
these
came
out
of
the
or
the
french
ship
most
likely
for
as
you
see
senor
there
is
quite
the
parisian
cut
to
this
coat
i
mark
these
things
for
i
was
once
apprenticed
to
a
tailor
in
madrid
he
stood
fondling
the
garment
lovingly
the
expression
of
his
face
so
solemnly
interested
i
had
difficulty
in
suppressing
a
laugh
some
change
in
your
trade
gunsaules
did
you
take
this
one
up
from
choice
you
do
not
look
to
me
like
a
fighting
man
he
glanced
apprehensively
at
the
open
door
speaking
even
lower
than
before
if
possible
no
more
am
i
senor
the
blood
make
me
faint
i
go
hungry
in
santo
domingo
god
forgive
me
for
ever
going
there
and
to
keep
from
starving
i
took
this
job
with
sanchez
or
before
the
bark
was
captured
before
senor
the
captain
name
was
schmitt
not
since
have
i
been
ashore
but
they
spare
me
because
i
was
spanish
i
would
have
asked
the
fellow
more
perhaps
even
have
tested
him
in
his
loyalty
to
his
new
masters
but
i
felt
this
was
neither
place
nor
time
estada
might
return
and
besides
the
man
was
evidently
a
creature
little
apt
to
be
of
service
even
if
he
so
desired
the
clothes
seem
to
be
all
right
steward
i
said
rather
briskly
and
i
judge
will
fit
now
hunt
me
up
first
of
all
something
to
shave
with
then
some
tobacco
and
a
pipe
and
yes
wait
a
second
writing
materials
yes
senor
and
by
the
way
there
are
two
staterooms
astern
who
occupies
the
one
to
starboard
senor
estada
no
senor
it
is
the
young
lady
oh
the
one
brought
aboard
last
night
have
you
seen
her
si
senor
she
is
english
and
good
to
look
at
but
she
sit
and
stare
out
the
stern
port
she
will
not
speak
or
eat
i
take
in
her
breakfast
but
she
touch
not
a
morsel
so
i
tell
senor
estada
and
he
say
bring
her
out
to
dinner
with
me
i
make
the
hussy
eat
if
i
have
to
choke
it
down
her
dainty
throat
good
i
have
a
look
at
her
myself
then
now
hurry
up
those
things
steward
and
remember
what
i
sent
you
after
he
brought
the
shaving
set
and
writing
materials
first
explaining
that
he
would
have
to
go
down
into
the
lazaret
and
break
open
some
packages
for
the
tobacco
and
pipe
the
moment
the
fellow
disappeared
i
grasped
the
opportunity
where
estada
had
gone
whether
back
into
his
stateroom
or
on
deck
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
in
fact
this
could
make
little
difference
for
it
was
not
likely
he
would
leave
me
alone
for
any
great
length
of
time
it
must
already
be
approaching
the
end
of
levere
watch
and
i
would
certainly
be
called
upon
to
relieve
him
and
following
my
turn
on
deck
would
be
dinner
in
the
cabin
and
the
probable
encounter
with
dorothy
this
clearly
meant
that
i
must
communicate
with
the
girl
immediately
or
not
at
all
i
dashed
off
a
note
hurriedly
a
brief
line
merely
stating
my
presence
on
board
and
begging
her
not
to
exhibit
surprise
at
meeting
me
i
had
no
time
in
which
to
explain
or
make
clear
the
situation
with
this
folded
and
concealed
in
my
hand
i
silently
pushed
open
the
door
and
took
a
hasty
glance
about
the
cabin
it
was
unoccupied
yet
i
must
move
with
caution
it
was
possible
for
one
on
deck
to
look
down
through
the
skylight
and
even
if
estada
was
not
in
his
own
room
the
nurse
assigned
to
sanchez
might
be
awake
and
appear
at
any
moment
the
risk
was
not
small
yet
must
be
taken
and
i
crept
swiftly
forward
following
the
circle
of
the
staterooms
until
i
came
to
the
closed
door
of
the
one
i
sought
aft
i
bent
here
an
instant
listening
for
some
sound
from
within
but
heard
none
i
dared
not
remain
or
even
venture
to
test
the
lock
gunsaules
had
said
this
was
her
place
of
confinement
and
there
was
seemingly
no
reason
why
she
should
have
been
given
a
guard
beyond
doubt
the
girl
was
within
and
alone
and
i
must
trust
her
quick
intelligence
to
respond
to
my
written
message
i
thrust
it
through
the
narrow
opening
above
the
sill
and
the
moment
it
disappeared
within
stole
swiftly
back
to
my
own
room
the
action
had
not
been
seen
and
yet
i
had
scarcely
a
moment
to
spare
before
i
could
lather
my
face
standing
before
a
small
cracked
mirror
bracing
myself
to
the
roll
of
the
bark
the
steward
returned
bearing
in
his
hands
tobacco
and
pipe
estada
however
remained
away
longer
than
i
had
anticipated
he
would
and
i
was
fully
dressed
and
comfortably
smoking
before
he
came
down
from
the
deck
and
crossed
the
cabin
to
my
partially
open
door
the
starboard
watch
has
been
called
he
said
and
you
are
to
take
charge
of
the
deck
relieving
levere
i
waited
to
explain
the
situation
to
the
men
before
you
appeared
i
suppose
you
are
ready
ay
ay
senor
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
my
pipe
and
rising
he
eyed
my
clothes
disapprovingly
rather
a
fancy
rig
gates
for
a
first
officer
on
duty
some
style
i
admit
senor
but
they
were
all
the
steward
offered
me
you
have
to
carry
a
hard
fist
my
man
to
back
up
that
costume
aboard
the
he
said
coldly
those
black
devils
are
apt
to
mistake
you
for
a
plaything
let
them
test
it
once
they
will
soon
find
i
have
the
hard
fist
tamed
wild
crews
before
today
and
it
might
as
well
be
first
as
last
i
suppose
half
measures
do
not
go
with
these
lads
santa
maria
it
is
kill
or
be
killed
in
our
trade
and
they
will
try
out
your
metal
come
on
now
i
followed
him
up
the
stairs
to
the
deck
his
words
had
in
no
way
alarmed
me
but
served
rather
to
harden
my
resolve
i
looked
for
trouble
and
was
inclined
to
welcome
it
anxious
indeed
to
prove
to
estada
my
ability
to
handle
men
nothing
else
would
so
quickly
appeal
to
him
or
serve
so
rapidly
to
establish
me
in
his
esteem
and
to
win
his
confidence
was
my
chief
concern
nothing
occurred
however
to
cause
any
breach
of
authority
a
few
fellows
were
lounging
amidships
and
stared
idly
at
us
as
we
mounted
to
the
poop
deck
these
were
of
the
fighting
contingent
i
supposed
and
the
real
members
of
the
crew
were
forward
levere
was
still
on
duty
and
came
forward
and
shook
hands
at
my
appearance
rather
glad
i
did
drown
you
he
said
intending
to
be
pleasant
but
hope
you
not
run
amuck
in
the
after
cabin
i
shall
try
not
too
unless
i
have
cause
i
answered
looking
him
square
in
the
eyes
and
determining
to
make
my
position
clear
at
once
senor
estada
tells
me
i
am
to
relieve
you
what
is
the
course
by
half
sou
we
might
be
carrying
more
canvas
there
is
nothing
to
hurry
about
and
the
fog
is
thick
that
will
probably
lift
within
an
hour
do
you
know
your
position
only
in
a
general
way
we
have
held
an
east
by
south
course
since
leaving
the
capes
until
an
hour
ago
making
about
ten
knots
very
well
i
will
figure
it
out
as
best
i
can
and
mark
it
on
the
chart
there
is
nothing
further
to
report
no
senor
all
has
been
as
it
is
now
he
glanced
toward
estada
not
greatly
pleased
i
presume
with
my
brusqueness
yet
finding
nothing
in
either
words
or
manner
from
which
to
evoke
a
quarrel
the
latter
had
overheard
our
conversation
but
he
stood
now
with
back
toward
us
looking
out
on
the
sea
off
the
port
quarter
his
silent
indifference
caused
levere
to
shrug
his
shoulders
and
disappear
down
the
ladder
on
his
way
below
i
turned
my
face
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
it
was
the
giant
negro
cochose
chapter
xv
the
cabin
of
the
namur
both
huge
black
hands
grasped
the
spokes
and
it
was
evident
that
it
required
all
his
giant
strength
to
control
the
bucking
wheel
he
was
an
brute
the
lower
portion
of
his
face
apelike
and
the
wool
growing
so
low
as
to
leave
him
scarcely
an
inch
of
forehead
his
eyes
lifted
an
instant
from
the
binnacle
card
to
glance
at
me
curiously
they
exhibited
no
flash
of
recognition
with
sudden
relief
and
a
determination
to
thoroughly
assure
myself
i
stepped
forward
and
accosted
him
little
heavy
for
one
man
is
it
oh
ah
do
mind
boss
his
thick
lips
grinning
ah
bin
alone
worse
tricks
den
dis
you
seem
to
be
holding
the
course
all
right
by
sou
senor
levere
says
yas
senor
what
is
your
name
cochose
senor
ah
a
french
nigger
very
good
cochose
my
name
is
gates
and
i
am
the
new
first
officer
if
you
need
any
help
let
me
know
he
nodded
still
grinning
to
let
me
realize
he
understood
and
i
stepped
aside
confident
that
the
fellow
retained
no
recollection
of
my
features
the
relief
of
this
knowledge
was
considerable
and
i
gazed
over
the
bark
forward
with
a
new
feeling
of
security
thus
far
i
had
successfully
passed
the
test
and
been
accepted
by
all
on
board
the
only
remaining
danger
of
recognition
lay
in
the
early
recovery
of
sanchez
and
as
i
glanced
aside
at
estada
the
conviction
became
fixed
in
my
mind
that
such
recovery
was
doubtful
i
felt
that
i
had
already
penetrated
the
cowardly
plan
of
the
portuguese
but
felt
no
inclination
to
interpose
indeed
i
had
more
occasion
to
dread
the
return
of
sanchez
to
command
than
did
estada
himself
with
me
life
was
at
stake
while
with
him
it
was
but
the
goal
of
ambition
and
power
brutal
and
evil
minded
as
estada
undoubtedly
was
i
had
taken
his
measure
and
felt
confident
of
being
able
to
outwit
him
but
sanchez
would
prove
a
different
problem
for
he
possessed
brains
and
cool
resourceful
courage
of
the
two
he
was
far
more
to
be
feared
for
half
an
hour
estada
hung
about
aft
apparently
paying
no
attention
to
me
and
yet
watching
my
movements
closely
there
was
little
to
be
done
but
i
thought
it
best
to
keep
the
watch
reasonably
busy
so
they
might
thus
learn
that
i
knew
my
work
they
proved
prompt
and
capable
enough
although
i
was
eyed
with
some
curiosity
when
i
went
forward
and
no
doubt
was
very
thoroughly
discussed
behind
my
back
the
idlers
amidships
were
a
totally
different
class
a
mongrel
scum
profanely
chatting
in
spanish
or
swaggering
about
the
deck
their
very
looks
a
challenge
however
they
kept
out
of
my
way
and
i
found
no
occasion
to
interfere
with
their
diversions
after
estada
left
the
deck
the
majority
amused
themselves
gambling
and
as
i
had
received
no
orders
to
interfere
i
permitted
the
games
to
proceed
mendez
interfered
only
once
on
occasion
of
a
brief
fight
my
only
instructions
from
the
portuguese
on
his
going
below
was
to
call
him
at
once
if
a
sail
was
sighted
apparently
he
was
satisfied
of
my
ability
to
command
the
deck
no
occasion
to
call
him
arose
during
my
watch
the
mist
of
fog
slowly
rose
and
drifted
away
leaving
a
wide
view
of
ocean
but
revealed
no
glimpse
of
any
other
craft
the
waves
gleamed
in
the
sun
as
we
plowed
bravely
through
them
and
the
wind
steadily
decreased
in
violence
i
had
the
crew
shake
out
reefs
in
jib
and
foresail
and
was
surprised
myself
at
the
sailing
qualities
of
the
bark
in
spite
of
breadth
of
beam
and
heavy
she
possessed
speed
and
ease
of
control
and
must
have
been
a
pretty
sight
as
we
bowled
along
through
that
deserted
sea
before
my
watch
was
up
i
could
see
gunsaules
through
the
skylight
busily
preparing
the
table
in
the
cabin
below
it
was
still
daylight
but
with
a
purple
gleam
across
the
waters
when
levere
arrived
on
deck
for
my
relief
we
were
talking
together
abaft
the
wheel
when
estada
appeared
in
the
every
promise
of
a
clear
night
he
said
glancing
about
at
the
horizon
better
change
the
course
two
points
east
levere
we
are
lying
in
too
close
to
the
coast
for
our
purpose
the
table
call
will
come
very
shortly
senor
gates
i
washed
up
hastily
in
my
stateroom
and
came
out
into
the
cabin
perplexed
as
to
what
might
occur
within
the
next
few
moments
yet
whatever
the
result
there
was
no
avoiding
it
would
the
girl
be
called
to
join
us
as
the
portuguese
had
threatened
had
she
received
my
note
of
warning
and
if
so
would
she
have
the
strength
to
play
her
part
so
as
to
avoid
suspicion
those
keen
searching
eyes
of
would
note
every
movement
observe
every
fleeting
expression
he
had
no
present
doubt
of
me
only
the
caution
natural
to
one
leading
his
life
of
danger
he
believed
my
story
and
nothing
thus
far
had
arisen
to
bring
him
the
slightest
doubt
to
his
mind
i
was
a
reckless
adventurer
ruined
by
drink
a
drifting
derelict
so
glad
to
be
picked
up
and
given
rank
as
to
be
forever
grateful
and
loyal
to
the
one
aiding
me
while
his
instinct
made
him
distrust
an
englishman
he
already
had
some
measure
of
faith
in
me
personally
yet
this
confidence
was
still
so
light
as
to
be
completely
shattered
by
the
slightest
mishap
my
every
move
must
be
one
of
extreme
caution
he
and
estevan
were
awaiting
me
the
latter
all
rigged
out
and
with
smooth
black
hair
oiled
and
plastered
down
upon
his
forehead
i
never
beheld
a
more
disagreeable
face
or
one
which
so
thoroughly
revealed
the
nature
of
a
man
as
i
touched
his
hand
at
estada
brief
introduction
it
was
as
if
i
fingered
a
snake
and
expected
to
be
greeted
with
a
kiss
gunsaules
hovered
about
an
open
door
leading
forward
and
the
table
had
been
set
for
four
as
i
knew
levere
had
eaten
alone
before
coming
to
my
relief
the
only
conclusion
was
that
the
portuguese
intended
that
we
be
joined
by
the
prisoner
indeed
he
gave
me
little
time
for
doubt
this
is
your
chair
gates
and
you
will
find
we
live
well
aboard
the
wine
women
and
song
hey
manuel
why
not
when
all
are
at
command
steward
you
told
the
lady
what
my
orders
were
si
senor
then
bid
her
join
us
we
stood
in
silence
as
gunsaules
crossed
the
deck
and
inserted
a
key
in
the
afterstateroom
door
manuel
was
grinning
in
full
enjoyment
but
the
expression
on
the
face
of
estada
was
that
of
grim
cruelty
evidently
he
expected
a
scene
an
outburst
of
resentment
pleading
and
tears
and
was
ready
enough
to
exercise
his
authority
perhaps
he
meant
all
this
as
a
lesson
to
me
perhaps
it
was
no
more
than
a
natural
exhibition
of
his
nature
yet
his
purpose
to
conquer
was
clearly
depicted
in
his
features
woman
would
be
made
to
obey
or
else
ruthlessly
crushed
i
felt
my
hands
grip
like
iron
on
my
chair
back
and
my
teeth
clinch
in
restraint
god
but
i
would
have
liked
to
grip
the
fellow
where
he
stood
all
the
hatred
in
my
soul
struggling
for
action
yet
that
would
only
mean
the
death
of
all
hope
and
i
turned
my
eyes
away
from
him
and
stared
with
the
others
at
the
opening
door
i
failed
to
catch
the
words
gunsaules
uttered
but
they
were
instantly
responded
to
out
into
the
full
light
of
the
cabin
the
woman
came
and
halted
barely
a
step
in
advance
of
the
steward
her
head
uplifted
proudly
her
eyes
on
us
never
before
had
i
realized
her
beauty
her
personality
as
i
did
then
the
glow
of
the
light
was
upon
her
face
and
there
was
color
in
her
cheeks
and
a
strange
appealing
look
in
her
eyes
her
posture
was
not
that
of
defiance
nor
of
surrender
she
stood
as
a
woman
defending
her
right
to
respect
sustained
by
a
wonderful
courage
i
caught
her
glance
but
there
was
no
recognition
in
it
not
by
the
flicker
of
an
eyelid
did
she
betray
surprise
and
yet
in
some
mysterious
manner
a
flash
of
intelligence
passed
between
us
it
was
all
instantaneous
for
her
gaze
seemed
to
concentrate
on
estada
as
though
she
knew
him
as
leader
you
sent
for
me
for
what
she
asked
her
spanish
clear
and
well
chosen
to
join
us
at
meal
he
answered
unmoved
it
is
better
than
to
remain
alone
better
you
must
have
a
strange
opinion
of
me
to
believe
i
would
sit
with
murderers
and
thieves
harsh
words
senorita
and
estada
grinned
grimly
yet
i
expected
them
there
are
many
trades
in
the
world
by
which
men
are
robbed
we
only
work
at
the
one
we
like
best
nor
will
i
discuss
that
with
you
however
senorita
i
can
say
that
we
have
taken
no
lives
in
this
last
affair
no
lives
in
sudden
incredulous
surprise
you
mean
my
uncle
lives
if
you
refer
to
fairfax
the
one
in
whose
room
the
chest
was
hidden
i
can
reply
truthfully
that
he
lives
one
of
my
men
struck
him
down
but
it
was
not
a
death
blow
if
that
be
the
reason
of
your
disdain
there
is
no
cause
this
chair
is
held
for
you
but
why
was
i
brought
away
a
prisoner
to
be
a
plaything
a
sport
for
your
pleasure
that
was
but
the
orders
of
our
chief
we
await
his
recovery
to
learn
his
purpose
sanchez
was
he
your
chief
a
pirate
a
buccaneer
we
prey
on
the
enemies
of
spain
he
explained
apparently
believing
his
own
words
it
is
war
with
us
without
regard
to
treaties
we
rob
only
that
we
may
carry
on
the
war
they
have
robbed
us
and
now
it
has
become
our
turn
it
was
at
captain
orders
we
waited
the
arrival
of
your
vessel
from
england
it
seems
he
met
you
on
the
voyage
yes
breathlessly
he
loved
you
he
would
no
doubt
have
dealt
with
you
honorably
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
to
be
his
purpose
now
to
this
end
you
gave
him
no
encouragement
is
not
this
true
i
i
did
not
like
him
yet
it
was
his
will
that
you
should
nothing
will
change
his
purpose
he
is
that
kind
and
he
has
the
power
he
determined
that
if
you
would
not
come
to
him
by
choice
you
should
be
made
to
by
force
you
are
here
now
by
his
orders
and
will
remain
until
you
consent
to
his
purpose
all
that
remains
for
you
to
decide
is
whether
you
choose
to
be
prisoner
or
guest
aboard
her
questioning
perplexed
eyes
turned
from
face
to
face
as
though
she
could
not
grasp
fully
the
purpose
of
what
was
said
he
he
is
still
alive
this
captain
sanchez
yes
with
a
chance
to
survive
and
if
he
lives
i
am
to
be
at
his
disposal
he
is
the
chief
here
his
will
is
law
aboard
and
if
he
should
die
estada
shrugged
his
shoulders
indifferently
who
knows
her
lips
tightened
as
though
to
hold
back
a
cry
while
one
hand
pressed
to
the
open
door
steadied
her
the
cheeks
were
no
longer
flushed
and
there
was
a
look
in
the
searching
eyes
i
did
not
like
to
see
it
was
a
moment
before
she
could
control
her
voice
i
have
heard
them
call
you
estada
she
said
finally
determined
to
learn
the
whole
truth
of
what
rank
in
this
company
are
you
i
am
pedro
estada
formerly
the
first
officer
now
by
occasion
of
captain
sanchez
wound
in
full
command
these
are
two
of
my
officers
senor
gates
one
of
your
own
countrymen
and
manuel
estevan
you
are
pirates
he
laughed
unpleasantly
as
though
the
word
had
an
ugly
sound
even
to
his
ears
rather
call
us
sea
rovers
senorita
it
better
expresses
our
trade
enough
to
admit
that
we
serve
under
no
flag
and
confess
no
master
and
now
that
i
have
answered
your
questions
what
is
it
to
be
between
us
peace
or
war
her
eyes
drooped
and
i
could
distinctly
note
the
trembling
of
her
slender
figure
when
she
slowly
raised
her
glance
once
more
it
rested
on
my
face
as
though
seeking
approval
guidance
if
there
be
only
the
one
choice
she
said
quietly
i
accept
peace
i
can
not
live
locked
in
that
room
alone
haunted
by
my
thoughts
and
memories
if
i
pledge
you
my
word
senor
am
i
to
enjoy
the
freedom
of
this
cabin
and
the
deck
estada
looked
at
us
a
shade
of
doubt
in
his
eyes
i
made
no
sign
but
manuel
nodded
why
not
he
asked
in
his
harsh
croak
of
a
voice
so
long
as
we
be
at
sea
what
harm
can
the
girl
do
perhaps
none
i
will
take
a
half
chance
at
least
you
shall
have
the
freedom
of
the
cabin
so
long
as
you
keep
your
word
while
as
to
the
deck
we
will
consider
that
later
prove
you
mean
what
you
say
by
joining
us
here
my
recollection
of
that
meal
is
not
of
words
but
of
faces
i
do
not
even
clearly
recall
what
it
was
we
talked
about
although
it
included
a
variety
of
topics
limited
somewhat
by
lack
of
knowledge
on
the
part
of
estada
and
manuel
the
former
attempted
conversation
but
soon
gave
up
the
effort
in
despair
his
eyes
however
sought
constantly
the
girl
face
and
to
my
consternation
exhibited
an
interest
in
her
personality
which
promised
trouble
i
know
not
whether
she
noticed
this
awakening
admiration
but
she
certainly
played
her
part
with
quiet
modesty
speaking
just
enough
to
entertain
and
hiding
the
deep
anxiety
against
which
she
struggled
i
believe
that
even
the
portuguese
reached
the
conclusion
that
she
was
not
altogether
regretful
for
this
adventure
and
that
it
was
safe
for
him
to
relax
some
degree
of
vigilance
his
manner
became
more
gracious
and
long
before
the
meal
ended
his
language
had
a
tendency
to
compliment
and
flatter
i
contented
myself
with
occasional
sentences
the
young
woman
sat
directly
across
from
me
our
words
overheard
by
all
and
as
i
knew
both
men
possessed
some
slight
knowledge
of
english
i
dare
not
venture
beyond
commonplace
conversation
in
that
tongue
with
quick
wit
she
took
her
cue
from
me
so
that
nothing
passed
between
us
either
by
word
of
mouth
or
glance
of
eye
to
arouse
suspicions
believing
the
feeling
of
confidence
would
be
increased
by
such
action
i
was
first
to
leave
the
table
and
it
being
my
watch
below
immediately
retired
to
my
room
noisily
closing
the
door
after
me
yet
refraining
from
letting
the
latch
catch
thus
enjoying
a
slight
opening
through
which
to
both
see
and
hear
manuel
did
not
linger
long
making
some
excuse
to
go
forward
but
estada
remained
for
some
time
endeavoring
to
entertain
she
laughed
at
his
efforts
and
appeared
interested
in
encouraging
him
so
that
he
kept
his
spirit
of
good
humor
even
amid
these
difficulties
his
egotism
made
a
fool
of
the
man
yet
even
he
finally
became
discouraged
of
making
her
comprehend
his
meaning
and
lapsed
into
a
silence
which
gave
her
an
excuse
to
retire
this
was
accomplished
so
graciously
as
to
leave
no
sting
the
fellow
actually
accompanying
her
to
the
door
of
her
stateroom
bowing
his
compliments
as
she
disappeared
within
the
fool
actually
believed
he
had
made
a
conquest
and
preened
himself
like
a
turkey
cock
gunsaules
senor
you
need
not
lock
the
senorita
in
her
room
or
guard
her
in
any
way
hereafter
she
is
permitted
to
come
and
go
as
she
pleases
aboard
si
senor
you
have
served
the
captain
and
jose
yes
did
the
wounded
man
eat
at
all
a
little
soup
senor
he
would
taste
nothing
else
estada
entered
his
own
stateroom
leaving
the
door
ajar
when
he
came
out
he
had
exchanged
his
coat
for
a
rough
jacket
thus
attired
for
a
turn
on
deck
he
disappeared
through
the
companion
chapter
xvi
in
dorothy
stateroom
i
stood
crouched
with
eye
at
the
crack
watchful
of
every
movement
in
the
lighted
cabin
my
own
decision
made
i
must
see
and
talk
with
dorothy
we
must
understand
each
other
and
the
earlier
we
could
thus
begin
working
together
in
unison
the
better
gunsaules
bore
a
tray
of
dishes
from
the
captain
room
and
then
after
carefully
wiping
up
the
main
table
and
sliding
it
up
out
of
the
way
on
its
stantions
placed
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
some
glasses
on
a
swinging
shelf
apparently
satisfied
that
his
work
there
was
completed
he
turned
down
the
light
and
departed
along
the
passage
leading
amidships
a
moment
later
i
heard
the
sound
of
dishes
grinding
together
preparatory
to
being
washed
no
better
opportunity
for
action
was
likely
to
occur
although
the
situation
was
not
without
peril
jose
might
emerge
at
any
instant
from
sanchez
cabin
while
i
had
no
reason
to
be
assured
that
estada
would
remain
long
on
deck
even
if
he
did
any
movement
below
could
be
observed
through
the
overhead
glass
indeed
it
might
be
with
this
purpose
in
view
that
he
had
gone
outside
however
i
felt
compelled
to
accept
the
chance
the
light
was
so
dim
that
i
believed
i
could
steal
cautiously
along
in
the
deeper
shadows
without
attracting
attention
from
the
deck
even
if
someone
stood
there
on
watch
i
moved
noiselessly
leaving
my
own
door
slightly
ajar
and
crept
along
close
to
the
side
walls
until
i
attained
my
destination
nothing
occurred
causing
me
to
fear
my
movements
were
detected
to
have
knocked
at
the
closed
door
however
softly
might
be
overheard
so
knowing
it
to
be
unlocked
i
merely
lifted
the
latch
noiselessly
and
slipped
quickly
within
there
was
no
light
except
a
glimmer
of
stars
through
a
large
after
port
but
against
this
faint
radiance
she
stood
vaguely
revealed
evidently
the
girl
had
been
standing
there
gazing
out
at
the
waters
and
had
turned
swiftly
about
at
my
entrance
aroused
by
some
slight
sound
her
first
thought
must
have
been
estada
for
there
was
a
startled
note
of
fear
in
her
challenge
who
are
you
why
do
you
come
here
speak
low
i
cautioned
you
must
know
my
voice
geoffry
carlyle
yes
but
do
not
use
that
name
all
hope
depends
on
my
remaining
unknown
you
welcome
me
she
came
straight
forward
through
the
dim
a
spectral
figure
with
both
hands
outstretched
welcome
her
tone
that
of
intense
sincerity
your
presence
gives
me
all
the
strength
i
have
but
for
you
i
should
throw
myself
through
that
port
into
the
sea
but
i
know
not
how
you
came
here
tell
me
you
are
not
really
one
of
these
wretches
no
you
must
believe
that
first
of
all
and
trust
me
i
do
but
but
tell
me
all
you
can
is
there
a
divan
here
or
anywhere
we
can
sit
down
together
i
can
see
nothing
in
this
darkness
yes
hold
my
hand
while
i
guide
you
we
can
sit
here
it
was
a
couch
of
some
kind
against
the
outer
wall
she
did
not
release
her
grasp
seemingly
gaining
courage
from
this
physical
contact
and
my
fingers
closed
warmly
over
her
own
now
please
breathlessly
how
is
it
possible
you
are
aboard
this
vessel
an
officer
i
told
her
the
strange
story
as
swiftly
and
simply
as
possible
speaking
scarcely
above
a
whisper
feeling
as
i
progressed
that
i
related
a
dream
rather
than
a
series
of
facts
it
seemed
to
me
she
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
believe
the
truth
of
what
i
said
and
yet
she
did
almost
unquestioningly
the
clasp
of
her
fingers
perceptibly
tightening
as
i
proceeded
the
soft
light
from
the
open
port
touched
her
face
slightly
enough
to
reveal
its
outline
and
she
sat
so
close
beside
me
her
eyes
uplifted
to
mine
that
i
could
feel
her
breath
upon
my
cheek
why
if
you
had
not
told
me
this
yourself
i
could
hardly
believe
such
a
tale
she
exclaimed
yet
it
must
be
true
miraculous
as
it
seems
but
what
is
to
be
the
ending
have
you
any
plan
of
escape
hardly
a
plan
i
have
had
no
opportunity
even
to
learn
the
true
nature
of
the
crew
watkins
is
an
honest
sailor
and
he
has
told
me
of
others
on
whom
i
could
rely
there
are
those
aboard
but
i
do
not
know
how
many
who
would
mutiny
if
they
had
a
leader
and
a
reasonable
chance
of
success
i
must
reach
these
and
learn
who
they
are
fortunately
the
voyage
promises
to
be
long
enough
to
enable
me
to
plan
carefully
you
have
discussed
the
voyage
with
this
man
estada
he
told
me
what
he
had
decided
upon
not
to
return
to
their
rendezvous
until
after
they
had
captured
some
prizes
and
could
go
with
gold
chinking
in
their
pockets
they
have
gold
already
the
chest
taken
from
my
uncle
that
only
serves
to
make
such
as
these
more
greedy
where
is
their
rendezvous
an
island
in
the
west
indies
probably
not
on
the
chart
they
call
it
porto
grande
and
they
will
sweep
the
ocean
between
here
and
there
seeking
victims
unarmed
merchantmen
to
rob
and
sink
and
you
you
will
be
compelled
to
take
part
in
such
scenes
such
acts
of
pillage
and
perhaps
murder
is
this
true
i
presume
i
must
seem
to
be
one
of
them
to
avoid
suspicion
there
is
some
hope
in
my
mind
that
we
may
chance
to
run
into
an
english
or
french
warship
quite
a
few
must
be
cruising
in
these
waters
but
these
are
only
contingencies
they
may
happen
and
they
may
not
how
we
are
to
act
under
such
conditions
will
have
to
be
decided
later
now
we
must
be
content
to
seek
release
through
our
own
efforts
have
you
any
suggestions
she
was
silent
for
a
long
moment
during
which
she
withdrew
her
hand
pressing
it
over
her
eyes
as
though
thus
to
better
concentrate
her
thoughts
there
is
conspiracy
on
board
already
she
said
finally
that
you
may
not
know
about
you
mean
to
depose
sanchez
i
questioned
in
surprise
yes
you
had
suspicioned
it
they
thought
me
unconscious
in
the
boat
and
talked
among
themselves
the
two
at
the
stern
estada
and
that
beast
manuel
i
did
not
understand
all
they
said
only
a
word
or
two
but
i
do
not
think
they
intend
the
captain
shall
recover
you
think
it
best
that
he
should
oh
i
do
not
know
there
is
no
best
that
i
can
see
yet
i
would
have
more
faith
in
being
spared
disgrace
if
at
the
mercy
of
sanchez
than
his
lieutenant
both
may
be
equally
guilty
equally
desperate
but
they
are
not
the
same
men
true
but
i
know
not
which
is
to
be
most
feared
i
may
be
wrong
she
insisted
for
i
judge
as
a
woman
yet
i
would
feel
safer
with
sanchez
he
cares
not
much
for
me
perhaps
yet
enough
so
that
i
possess
some
power
over
him
the
other
does
not
he
merely
desires
with
the
passions
of
a
brute
no
appeal
would
reach
him
he
would
laugh
at
tears
and
find
pleasure
in
suffering
i
do
not
quite
believe
this
of
sanchez
perhaps
not
other
may
be
the
greater
beast
i
know
he
is
the
proof
is
in
those
horrid
eyes
what
is
the
man
of
what
race
portuguese
i
am
told
but
likely
a
ugh
it
makes
me
shudder
to
even
look
at
him
and
yet
you
would
have
me
appear
friendly
we
can
not
permit
him
to
feel
that
either
of
us
are
enemies
he
is
the
power
aboard
our
lives
everything
are
in
his
hands
if
he
means
to
be
rid
of
sanchez
the
man
is
doomed
for
he
will
find
a
way
to
accomplish
his
purpose
at
whatever
cost
murder
means
nothing
to
these
men
of
course
you
are
right
she
acknowledged
our
case
is
so
desperate
we
must
resort
to
any
weapons
you
believe
it
will
serve
the
possibility
of
escape
if
i
permit
this
monster
to
imagine
that
i
have
some
interest
in
him
to
do
so
might
delay
the
explosion
i
replied
gravely
and
just
now
any
delay
is
welcome
i
know
how
such
an
effort
will
try
you
but
the
end
may
be
well
worth
the
sacrifice
i
doubt
if
even
estada
will
resort
to
force
on
board
indeed
force
will
be
the
very
last
card
he
will
care
to
play
in
your
case
he
is
a
brute
and
capable
of
any
crime
yet
at
heart
a
coward
there
is
reason
why
he
will
fear
to
assault
you
you
are
english
and
all
the
practical
seamen
on
board
are
from
northern
europe
english
and
scandinavian
these
men
are
not
pirates
from
choice
they
are
prisoners
who
have
taken
on
to
save
their
own
lives
with
his
bullies
and
amidships
he
can
compel
them
to
work
but
he
dare
not
go
too
far
once
these
fellows
unite
in
mutiny
they
could
take
the
ship
an
assault
on
you
would
be
dangerous
it
is
these
men
you
count
on
yes
but
for
me
to
gain
their
confidence
and
leadership
will
require
time
i
must
reach
them
all
secretly
and
alone
not
more
than
half
are
in
my
watch
and
watkins
must
approach
the
others
a
plan
for
concerted
action
will
have
to
be
arranged
and
every
precaution
taken
the
slightest
slip
would
mean
failure
and
merciless
punishment
even
if
i
succeed
in
gathering
together
all
these
better
elements
on
board
we
shall
yet
be
outnumbered
two
to
one
perhaps
more
and
our
only
hope
rests
in
surprise
at
best
the
situation
is
absolutely
desperate
but
i
see
no
other
solution
and
my
service
is
deceit
the
acting
of
a
part
to
blind
the
eyes
of
estada
i
sincerely
believe
your
greater
chance
of
security
lies
in
this
course
the
fellow
is
a
supreme
egotist
opposition
will
anger
him
while
flattery
will
make
him
subservient
you
have
the
wit
and
discretion
to
hold
him
within
certain
limits
it
is
a
dangerous
game
i
admit
and
a
disagreeable
one
but
the
case
requires
desperate
remedies
she
lifted
her
eyes
searching
my
face
through
the
dim
light
geoffry
carlyle
she
said
at
last
a
tremor
in
the
low
voice
there
is
no
sacrifice
i
would
not
make
to
preserve
my
honor
i
hate
this
man
i
dread
his
touch
i
shrink
from
contact
with
him
as
i
would
from
a
snake
but
i
am
not
going
to
refuse
to
do
my
part
if
you
say
this
is
right
and
justified
i
will
consent
i
believe
it
is
and
you
will
not
lose
faith
in
me
she
questioned
earnestly
it
will
not
lower
your
belief
in
my
womanhood
nothing
could
do
that
mistress
dorothy
i
want
you
to
realize
the
depth
of
my
interest
and
respect
your
friendliness
has
meant
much
to
me
and
i
would
never
urge
you
to
lower
your
ideals
but
we
must
face
this
situation
as
it
is
you
can
not
cling
now
to
the
standards
of
london
or
even
maryland
we
are
on
the
ocean
upon
a
pirate
ship
surrounded
by
men
utterly
devoid
of
all
restraint
of
the
sea
who
live
by
murder
and
pillage
we
possess
but
two
weapons
of
defense
deceit
or
force
a
resort
to
the
latter
is
at
present
impossible
i
can
not
conceive
that
you
are
lowering
yourself
in
any
way
by
using
the
power
you
possess
to
escape
violence
the
power
i
possess
yes
beauty
and
wit
these
are
your
weapons
and
most
effective
ones
you
can
play
with
estada
and
defeat
him
temporarily
at
least
i
confess
there
is
danger
in
such
a
game
he
is
a
wild
beast
and
his
evil
nature
may
overcome
his
discretion
you
are
armed
no
i
have
never
felt
the
need
then
take
this
and
i
thrust
a
pistol
into
her
hands
i
took
it
from
the
rack
in
the
cabin
and
can
get
another
it
is
charged
keep
it
hidden
about
your
person
but
use
it
only
when
all
else
fails
do
you
see
this
necessity
now
from
my
standpoint
yes
hesitatingly
all
that
you
say
is
true
but
but
the
thought
frightens
me
it
it
is
like
creeping
into
a
lion
cage
having
only
a
fan
with
which
to
defend
myself
i
smiled
at
her
conceit
a
fan
rightly
used
is
no
insignificant
weapon
in
the
hands
of
a
woman
it
has
won
many
a
victory
i
have
faith
in
your
wielding
it
to
the
best
effect
the
lasting
discomfiture
of
senor
estada
you
laugh
indignantly
believing
me
a
coquette
a
girl
to
play
with
men
no
that
misconstrues
my
thought
i
believe
you
a
true
woman
yet
possessing
the
natural
instincts
of
your
sex
and
able
to
use
your
weapons
efficiently
there
is
no
evil
in
that
no
reproach
i
would
not
have
you
otherwise
and
we
must
not
misunderstand
each
other
you
retain
faith
in
me
implicitly
and
pledge
yourself
to
your
part
leaving
me
to
attend
to
mine
her
two
hands
clasped
my
fingers
her
eyes
uplifted
geoffry
carlyle
i
have
always
believed
in
you
and
now
after
the
sacrifice
you
have
made
to
serve
me
i
can
refuse
you
nothing
you
ask
i
will
endeavor
to
accomplish
all
you
require
of
me
god
knows
how
i
hate
the
task
but
but
i
will
do
my
best
only
only
her
voice
sank
if
if
the
monster
can
not
be
held
i
will
kill
him
i
hope
you
do
i
shall
if
the
beast
lays
hands
on
me
he
he
pays
the
price
i
could
not
do
otherwise
geoffry
carlyle
i
am
a
fairfax
satisfied
with
my
mission
and
confident
nothing
more
need
be
said
i
arose
to
my
feet
then
we
can
do
nothing
further
until
i
learn
the
disposition
of
the
crew
i
said
quietly
estada
is
not
likely
to
resort
to
extreme
measures
at
present
he
has
two
objects
before
him
permit
sanchez
to
die
of
his
wounds
if
that
is
at
all
probable
and
to
win
the
men
by
some
successful
capture
these
fellows
only
retain
command
by
success
the
taking
of
a
rich
ship
will
make
estada
a
hero
while
a
defeat
would
mean
his
overthrow
and
the
ascendancy
of
someone
else
there
is
no
other
test
of
a
robber
chief
estada
knows
this
and
will
not
dare
act
until
he
has
put
clinking
coin
in
the
pockets
of
his
men
that
is
why
i
believe
you
are
comparatively
safe
now
his
own
position
of
command
is
in
the
balance
i
am
glad
you
explained
that
to
me
the
knowledge
will
give
me
more
confidence
do
not
rely
too
much
on
his
control
of
himself
there
is
no
trust
to
be
put
in
such
a
man
i
must
go
now
and
endeavor
to
reach
my
quarters
unseen
i
will
see
you
again
perhaps
not
here
it
is
too
dangerous
but
i
will
find
means
to
communicate
with
you
possibly
the
steward
can
be
trusted
as
a
messenger
i
will
talk
with
him
and
make
sure
meanwhile
we
must
not
appear
interested
in
each
other
we
stood
with
hands
clasped
in
the
darkness
i
thought
she
was
going
to
speak
again
but
the
words
failed
to
come
then
suddenly
silently
the
door
opened
a
mere
crack
letting
in
a
gleam
of
yellow
light
from
the
main
cabin
while
the
crouching
figure
of
a
man
like
a
gliding
shadow
slipped
through
the
aperture
closing
the
door
behind
him
as
softly
as
he
had
opened
it
i
heard
her
catch
her
breath
and
felt
her
hands
grasp
my
sleeve
but
i
never
stirred
the
fellow
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
us
and
i
stared
into
the
black
curtain
endeavoring
to
locate
him
by
some
sound
of
movement
who
could
he
be
what
might
be
the
purpose
of
his
entrance
but
one
answer
occurred
to
me
pedro
estada
driven
by
unbridled
passions
to
attack
the
girl
mad
as
such
an
act
would
be
yet
no
other
explanation
seemed
possible
i
thrust
her
behind
me
and
took
a
step
forward
with
body
poised
for
action
i
was
unarmed
but
cared
little
for
that
in
the
swift
desire
felt
to
come
to
hand
grips
with
the
brute
i
could
hear
him
now
slowly
and
cautiously
feeling
his
way
toward
us
through
the
darkness
chapter
xvii
a
murder
on
board
the
fellow
made
scarcely
a
sound
as
he
advanced
yet
as
i
waited
breathlessly
i
felt
assured
of
his
stealthy
approach
to
be
certain
of
free
space
i
extended
one
hand
and
my
fingers
came
into
unexpected
contact
with
the
back
of
a
chair
without
moving
my
body
i
grasped
this
welcome
weapon
of
defense
and
swung
it
above
my
head
whoever
the
invader
creeping
upon
us
might
prove
to
be
he
was
certainly
an
enemy
actuated
by
some
foul
purpose
and
no
doubt
armed
to
strike
him
down
as
quickly
and
silently
as
possible
was
therefore
the
plain
duty
of
the
moment
i
had
no
other
thought
the
slowness
with
which
he
groped
his
way
forward
indicated
unfamiliarity
with
the
apartment
although
his
direct
advance
proclaimed
some
special
purpose
clearly
he
had
no
fear
of
attack
believing
no
one
more
formidable
than
a
girl
was
there
to
oppose
him
the
darkness
perhaps
and
silence
convinced
the
fellow
that
she
had
already
retired
he
would
have
his
grip
on
her
before
she
could
even
dream
of
his
presence
then
there
would
be
no
scream
no
alarm
i
could
determine
almost
his
exact
position
as
his
advancing
foot
felt
cautiously
along
the
deck
seeking
to
avoid
striking
any
obstacle
in
the
darkness
he
came
forward
inch
by
inch
and
i
had
the
sensation
of
awaiting
the
spring
of
some
creeping
animal
about
to
leap
upon
me
with
tense
muscles
the
heavy
chair
poised
for
a
blow
i
measured
the
distance
as
indicated
by
faint
shuffling
sounds
perceptible
only
because
of
the
profound
stillness
i
could
not
see
but
i
knew
i
felt
his
presence
in
imagination
i
pictured
him
with
arms
outstretched
barely
beyond
my
reach
deliberately
advancing
one
foot
for
yet
another
step
forward
with
all
my
force
i
struck
blindly
as
it
had
been
delivered
the
blow
hit
fair
there
was
a
thud
an
inarticulate
groan
and
the
fall
of
a
body
onto
the
floor
beyond
that
nothing
i
waited
breathlessly
the
chair
back
gripped
in
my
hands
anxiously
listening
for
the
slightest
movement
there
was
none
to
be
distinguished
not
so
much
as
the
quiver
of
a
muscle
i
felt
dorothy
touch
my
shoulder
and
caught
the
sound
of
her
voice
trembling
at
my
ear
what
it
is
what
did
you
do
i
struck
him
with
a
chair
he
lies
there
on
the
deck
wait
where
you
are
until
i
learn
what
has
happened
i
bent
over
and
touched
him
dropping
to
my
knees
every
nerve
tingling
as
my
hands
felt
of
the
recumbent
body
the
fellow
lay
in
a
heap
his
flesh
warm
but
with
no
perceptible
no
semblance
of
breathing
my
fingers
sought
his
face
and
i
could
scarcely
suppress
a
cry
of
surprise
he
was
not
estada
who
then
was
he
what
could
have
been
his
purpose
in
thus
invading
this
stateroom
all
i
could
grasp
was
the
fact
that
the
fellow
was
not
the
portuguese
he
possessed
a
smooth
face
long
hair
and
was
a
much
smaller
man
it
must
have
become
overcast
without
for
the
was
no
longer
visible
through
the
after
port
and
yet
a
faint
light
entered
sufficient
for
my
purpose
i
dragged
the
body
that
way
dropping
it
where
the
slight
illumination
fell
directly
on
the
upturned
face
the
features
revealed
were
unfamiliar
those
unquestionably
of
a
indian
dorothy
crossed
to
my
side
her
foot
striking
a
knife
which
came
glimmering
into
the
narrow
range
of
light
she
stared
in
horror
at
the
ugly
weapon
and
then
at
the
ghastly
countenance
who
is
he
do
you
know
one
i
have
never
seen
before
he
must
belong
to
the
gang
amidships
an
indian
she
shuddered
her
voice
trembling
he
came
to
murder
see
his
knife
lies
there
why
should
he
have
sought
to
kill
me
it
is
all
mystery
i
admitted
and
too
deep
for
me
perhaps
it
was
a
mistake
or
the
fellow
thought
you
had
jewels
anyway
he
will
never
try
that
trick
again
see
my
blow
crushed
his
skull
he
is
actually
dead
beyond
doubt
the
chair
was
a
heavy
one
and
i
struck
with
all
my
strength
what
shall
be
done
with
the
body
it
can
not
be
left
lying
exposed
here
no
one
would
believe
you
killed
him
and
my
presence
must
not
be
suspected
could
it
she
suggested
be
dropped
astern
through
the
port
ay
that
might
be
done
it
was
dull
of
me
not
to
think
of
that
yet
we
must
not
risk
a
splash
to
be
overheard
on
deck
is
there
a
rope
of
any
kind
to
be
had
only
this
curtain
cord
it
is
not
large
but
strong
that
ought
to
do
if
long
enough
there
must
be
a
drop
to
the
water
yes
splice
the
two
together
let
me
have
them
she
shrank
back
from
touching
the
inanimate
figure
her
face
very
pale
in
the
dim
light
yet
it
required
the
combined
efforts
of
both
to
force
the
stiffening
body
through
the
port
hole
and
then
lower
it
slowly
to
the
surging
water
below
the
cord
cut
our
hands
cruelly
but
it
held
and
the
dead
man
sank
beneath
the
surface
and
was
swept
swiftly
astern
into
the
black
depths
we
could
distinguish
footsteps
on
the
deck
above
but
these
were
regular
and
undisturbed
the
slow
promenade
from
rail
to
rail
of
the
officer
on
watch
clearly
nothing
had
been
heard
or
seen
to
awaken
suspicion
i
turned
back
as
the
released
body
vanished
to
look
into
her
face
which
was
scarcely
visible
if
you
should
be
questioned
tomorrow
you
had
best
know
nothing
i
said
gravely
i
do
not
think
you
will
be
for
surely
such
an
attack
can
be
no
plan
of
estada
it
could
gain
him
no
advantage
the
fellow
was
pillaging
on
his
own
account
if
he
is
missed
it
will
be
supposed
he
fell
overboard
and
no
one
will
greatly
care
you
will
be
able
to
learn
i
i
shall
feel
better
if
i
know
the
truth
possibly
however
it
will
be
safer
for
me
not
to
ask
questions
i
am
not
myself
in
too
good
repute
aboard
you
are
not
afraid
to
remain
here
alone
no
i
am
not
greatly
frightened
but
shall
try
and
bar
the
door
with
a
chair
i
have
no
key
then
i
leave
you
half
of
my
watch
below
must
be
gone
by
now
i
take
the
fellow
knife
along
as
it
must
not
be
found
here
we
parted
with
a
clasp
of
hands
as
i
opened
the
stateroom
door
and
slipped
out
into
the
cabin
to
my
surprise
the
light
over
the
table
had
been
extinguished
rendering
the
cabin
so
black
i
held
to
actually
feel
my
way
forward
this
struck
me
as
very
strange
particularly
as
i
recalled
clearly
that
a
stream
of
light
had
flashed
into
the
after
stateroom
with
the
entrance
of
the
prowler
the
lantern
must
have
been
put
out
since
then
by
some
confederate
gunsaules
would
be
soundly
asleep
long
ago
and
the
light
was
supposed
to
burn
until
morning
however
there
was
no
noise
other
than
the
creaking
and
groaning
of
the
ship
timbers
mingled
with
the
steady
tread
of
levere
on
the
upper
deck
so
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
i
found
my
way
across
to
my
own
stateroom
and
pressed
open
the
door
a
misty
light
came
in
through
the
port
sufficient
to
show
me
all
was
exactly
as
i
had
left
it
and
i
flung
off
my
jacket
preparatory
to
lying
down
for
a
short
rest
before
being
recalled
for
the
watch
on
deck
the
hilt
of
the
knife
in
my
belt
attracted
my
attention
and
i
drew
it
forth
curious
to
learn
if
it
bore
any
mark
of
ownership
whether
it
did
or
not
i
shall
never
know
as
my
eyes
were
instantly
attracted
to
a
dark
stain
on
both
hilt
and
blade
i
held
it
to
the
light
it
was
the
stain
of
blood
and
my
hands
were
also
reddened
by
it
in
that
first
instant
of
horror
i
hurled
the
weapon
out
through
the
open
port
into
the
sea
blood
human
blood
without
doubt
there
had
been
murder
committed
on
board
and
the
fellow
i
had
struck
down
was
seeking
refuge
endeavoring
to
find
concealment
following
his
crime
ay
but
what
about
the
light
in
the
cabin
it
had
been
extinguished
after
the
fleeing
fugitive
had
entered
stateroom
did
this
mean
that
the
slayer
had
an
accomplice
if
so
then
the
killing
was
not
the
result
of
a
mere
personal
quarrel
amidships
or
in
the
forecastle
but
the
result
of
some
conspiracy
i
thought
of
sanchez
and
of
estada
plan
to
obtain
control
of
the
ship
could
this
be
its
culmination
and
was
the
spaniard
already
lying
dead
in
his
cabin
this
was
the
only
solution
of
the
mystery
which
seemed
probable
and
yet
this
did
not
wholly
satisfy
my
mind
not
that
i
questioned
the
fiendishness
of
estada
or
his
coconspirator
manuel
or
their
unwillingness
to
commit
such
a
crime
but
it
seemed
so
unnecessarily
brutal
why
should
they
stab
a
man
already
so
severely
wounded
as
to
be
threatened
with
death
he
was
helpless
and
in
their
power
neglect
or
at
most
a
simple
reopening
of
his
wounds
would
be
sufficient
for
their
purpose
to
attack
him
anew
would
only
mean
exposure
and
perhaps
awaken
the
enmity
of
the
crew
nothing
came
of
my
thought
only
confusion
nor
did
i
dare
investigate
for
fear
of
becoming
more
deeply
involved
in
the
tragedy
there
had
been
no
alarm
everything
aboard
was
going
on
as
usual
i
could
hear
levere
tramping
the
deck
and
occasionally
catch
the
echo
of
his
voice
as
he
hailed
the
or
gave
some
order
to
the
men
forward
no
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
my
safety
and
the
safety
of
the
girl
depended
on
our
apparent
ignorance
of
what
had
occurred
we
must
have
no
part
in
it
no
knowledge
or
suspicion
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
the
revelation
of
the
morning
convincing
myself
of
this
i
washed
the
blood
stains
from
my
hands
and
lay
down
in
the
bunk
fully
dressed
to
await
my
call
evidently
the
wind
had
decreased
as
the
pitched
but
little
in
the
sea
and
i
could
hear
the
scuffling
of
feet
indicating
a
new
spread
of
canvas
above
the
night
air
blowing
in
through
my
open
port
became
so
chill
that
i
covered
myself
with
a
blanket
the
vessel
creaked
and
groaned
in
every
joint
some
of
the
sounds
actually
startling
me
with
their
resemblance
to
cries
of
human
agony
i
tossed
about
occasionally
sitting
upright
to
peer
around
in
the
darkness
my
body
bathed
in
cold
perspiration
yet
must
have
dropped
finally
off
into
an
uneasy
sleep
a
sharp
rapping
of
knuckles
on
the
door
awoke
me
with
a
start
starboard
watch
senor
will
be
on
deck
at
once
ay
ay
senor
i
drew
on
a
heavy
pea
jacket
of
leather
fastening
it
securely
at
the
throat
and
donned
a
wool
cap
the
lantern
in
the
cabin
had
been
relighted
and
was
burning
brightly
and
my
anxious
glance
about
the
interior
revealed
nothing
out
of
place
the
only
door
open
led
to
the
steward
storeroom
feeling
it
best
to
be
prepared
for
any
eventuality
i
selected
a
pistol
from
the
rack
saw
to
its
loading
and
slipped
the
weapon
into
my
pocket
except
for
one
man
busily
engaged
coiling
a
rope
the
main
deck
was
deserted
and
i
climbed
the
short
ladder
to
the
poop
meeting
levere
as
i
straightened
up
the
sea
was
a
gentle
swell
the
sky
clear
above
but
with
a
mass
of
dark
clouds
off
the
port
quarter
a
glance
aloft
revealed
a
full
spread
of
canvas
the
air
contained
a
nip
of
frost
all
set
i
see
levere
si
senor
and
at
that
we
barely
move
the
bark
needs
a
gale
o
wind
to
make
any
headway
you
have
no
fear
of
the
storm
yonder
he
glanced
aside
at
the
mass
of
cloud
no
senor
it
hung
just
there
an
hour
past
not
come
here
but
creep
around
your
course
still
to
the
sou
o
east
senor
he
bent
down
to
glance
at
the
card
and
i
saw
his
dark
face
in
the
gleam
of
the
binnacle
light
he
was
not
bad
looking
but
for
the
continuous
gleam
of
prominent
teeth
he
straightened
up
who
put
out
the
cabin
light
senor
i
am
sure
i
do
know
was
it
out
yes
senor
i
never
knew
that
to
happen
before
an
accident
no
doubt
the
steward
probably
left
some
port
open
and
a
gust
of
wind
did
the
business
that
nothing
to
worry
over
he
shook
his
head
as
though
far
from
satisfied
by
my
theory
but
went
below
without
attempting
to
reply
i
watched
him
through
the
skylight
but
he
merely
gulped
down
a
glass
of
liquor
and
entered
his
stateroom
my
watch
was
uneventful
the
fellow
at
the
wheel
was
unfamiliar
to
me
and
rather
surly
in
his
answers
to
the
few
questions
i
put
to
him
as
he
could
speak
nothing
but
spanish
i
soon
left
him
alone
and
fell
to
pacing
the
deck
immersed
in
my
own
thoughts
these
were
far
from
pleasant
ones
as
i
reviewed
again
the
strange
situation
in
which
i
found
myself
circumstances
had
played
me
a
sorry
trick
without
plan
almost
without
effort
i
had
drifted
into
a
position
of
utmost
delicacy
any
accident
or
mistake
might
lead
to
disastrous
results
not
only
my
own
life
but
the
life
of
the
young
woman
below
could
be
endangered
by
a
single
careless
word
or
act
the
whole
affair
seemed
more
a
nightmare
than
a
reality
i
was
actually
serving
as
first
officer
on
a
pirate
ship
in
search
of
vessels
to
rob
on
the
high
seas
commanding
a
crew
of
west
indian
the
very
scum
of
hell
and
under
the
order
of
a
portuguese
devil
whose
ambition
coolly
plotted
murder
i
was
sailing
under
the
black
flag
to
be
hung
if
captured
compelled
to
act
out
the
masquerade
a
satellite
of
the
most
infamous
villain
who
ever
sacked
a
merchantman
why
the
very
name
of
sanchez
had
been
horror
to
me
in
the
past
yet
here
i
actually
was
in
charge
of
the
deck
of
his
death
ship
searching
for
new
victims
and
only
hoping
that
the
arch
villain
might
live
to
overthrow
the
even
fouler
demon
who
would
succeed
him
if
he
died
already
i
knew
murder
had
been
done
that
the
coming
morning
would
reveal
some
hideous
tragedy
on
which
perhaps
my
fate
would
depend
somewhere
below
in
the
dark
lay
a
dead
man
his
sightless
eyes
staring
upward
the
curse
of
crime
was
upon
the
vessel
and
this
possibly
was
only
the
beginning
whose
end
could
not
be
foreseen
and
for
what
was
i
there
the
answer
was
not
upon
my
lips
but
in
my
heart
dorothy
fairfax
i
bowed
my
head
on
the
rail
and
stared
out
over
the
dark
water
but
i
saw
only
her
face
no
i
would
not
turn
back
would
not
fail
her
let
the
end
be
death
and
disgrace
i
meant
to
fight
grimly
on
until
that
end
came
in
that
hour
i
knew
she
was
more
to
me
than
life
or
even
honor
far
more
than
mere
duty
bound
me
i
was
prisoner
to
love
the
dawn
came
cold
and
gray
but
with
clearing
skies
the
force
of
the
wind
increased
becoming
unsteady
and
causing
a
choppy
sea
so
that
i
felt
impelled
to
lower
the
topsails
and
take
a
reef
in
the
larger
canvas
nothing
was
reported
in
sight
but
to
reassure
myself
i
climbed
into
the
main
crosstrees
and
swept
the
horizon
with
a
glass
not
so
much
as
a
speck
rewarded
my
efforts
and
i
descended
the
ratlines
shouting
to
the
boatswain
to
call
the
port
watch
watkins
came
aft
to
the
wheel
and
i
sent
the
fellow
thus
relieved
down
into
the
cabin
to
rout
out
levere
the
two
returned
to
deck
together
the
negro
glancing
about
curiously
without
mounting
the
ladder
you
call
senor
estada
yet
he
questioned
no
i
had
no
orders
to
do
so
he
tol
me
call
him
at
daylight
here
you
amada
go
wake
up
the
senor
the
seaman
disappeared
grumbling
while
levere
crossed
the
poop
deck
and
stood
beside
me
looking
out
across
the
expanse
of
sea
no
sail
hey
we
hav
bad
luck
too
far
north
and
west
we
are
out
of
the
sea
lanes
but
if
it
keeps
bright
take
an
observation
at
noon
amada
emerged
from
the
companion
and
stared
up
at
us
shading
his
mouth
with
one
hand
as
he
spoke
he
answer
nothing
senor
levere
you
rapped
on
the
door
si
senor
i
strike
with
my
fist
and
my
boot
but
he
never
wake
up
was
the
door
locked
i
know
not
senor
i
not
try
open
it
levere
gave
utterance
to
an
oath
the
swine
he
said
fiercely
i
suppose
i
have
to
go
myself
our
eyes
met
and
something
seemed
to
bid
me
accompany
him
we
go
down
together
senor
i
said
quietly
estada
must
be
sick
i
could
hear
the
rumpus
amada
kicked
up
even
on
deck
here
no
man
could
sleep
through
that
racket
chapter
xviii
a
new
conspiracy
the
interior
of
the
cabin
appeared
more
desolate
than
ever
in
the
gray
light
of
dawn
the
swinging
light
yet
burned
but
was
now
useless
all
the
dismal
horrors
of
the
place
revealed
by
the
slowly
increasing
gleam
of
day
stealing
down
from
above
gunsaules
had
not
appeared
and
levere
stateroom
door
remained
ajar
giving
glimpse
of
the
disarranged
bunk
within
the
other
doors
were
tightly
closed
levere
rather
held
back
not
noticeably
so
perhaps
yet
enough
to
give
me
the
lead
and
with
one
swift
glance
about
i
led
the
way
directly
to
estada
stateroom
something
sinister
had
occurred
during
the
dark
hours
of
the
night
of
that
i
was
convinced
and
i
believed
we
were
now
about
to
lift
the
veil
hiding
the
tragedy
my
heart
pounded
like
a
hammer
as
i
rapped
on
the
wooden
panels
and
waited
some
response
from
within
there
was
no
answer
no
sound
of
movement
and
i
rapped
again
more
loudly
my
questioning
eyes
seeking
levere
face
he
was
listening
as
intently
as
myself
his
eyes
expressing
anxiety
if
i
had
felt
some
suspicion
of
the
man
before
this
lack
of
faith
vanished
certainly
was
concerned
in
no
plot
involving
the
life
of
the
portuguese
there
is
something
wrong
senor
he
whispered
for
he
was
ever
a
light
sleeper
then
we
will
find
out
what
it
is
the
door
was
unlocked
the
latch
yielding
instantly
to
the
hand
and
i
stepped
within
a
glance
told
everything
the
port
was
closed
but
through
the
thick
glass
sufficient
light
found
entrance
to
reveal
the
interior
the
chair
before
the
table
was
overturned
and
there
were
papers
scattered
about
the
deck
estada
lay
in
his
bunk
with
one
leg
dangling
outside
and
his
head
crooked
against
the
side
wall
his
very
posture
was
that
of
sudden
death
even
had
it
not
been
pictured
by
the
ghastly
face
peculiarly
hideous
in
the
gray
light
which
stared
at
us
and
the
dark
pool
of
blood
underneath
i
heard
an
exclamation
from
levere
and
stood
for
an
instant
utterly
unable
to
move
the
only
sound
audible
was
the
steady
drip
of
blood
i
knew
already
what
i
should
find
yet
finally
forced
myself
forward
he
was
stone
dead
pierced
with
three
knife
thrusts
i
stood
up
and
faced
the
mulatto
whose
countenance
was
fairly
green
with
horror
what
do
you
know
about
this
senor
levere
i
asked
sternly
the
man
has
been
murdered
knifed
who
did
it
and
why
he
could
scarcely
answer
gripping
at
the
table
for
support
and
never
removing
his
gaze
from
the
face
of
the
dead
man
yet
i
believed
his
words
was
convinced
this
was
not
the
terror
of
guilt
my
god
i
can
not
tell
i
have
never
dreamed
of
this
that
is
true
senor
had
the
man
enemies
anyone
you
would
suspect
enemies
ay
plenty
of
them
we
all
have
we
expect
that
in
our
trade
this
ship
is
full
of
devils
ready
enough
to
do
such
a
job
but
i
could
not
name
the
one
who
did
do
it
i
know
of
no
cause
i
have
heard
nothing
i
believe
you
levere
i
said
when
his
voice
ceased
yet
unwilling
even
then
to
trust
him
fully
all
that
rules
here
is
strength
murder
is
but
a
weapon
and
hate
struck
this
blow
what
can
we
do
senor
do
we
must
talk
that
over
first
open
the
port
there
and
let
in
some
fresh
air
that
is
better
but
we
can
not
think
looking
at
that
ghastly
face
and
hearing
the
blood
drip
onto
the
deck
we
leave
him
here
and
talk
over
the
affair
in
the
cabin
but
the
men
will
think
it
strange
he
protested
if
i
do
not
return
to
the
deck
some
may
know
what
lies
here
we
can
not
help
that
levere
we
can
not
meet
this
thing
until
we
are
prepared
until
we
talk
it
over
and
decide
what
to
do
it
is
not
the
men
on
deck
the
watch
i
fear
but
those
fellows
amidships
they
are
the
ones
to
be
afraid
of
is
that
not
so
si
senor
then
come
there
is
more
danger
in
hasty
action
than
anything
else
i
shut
the
door
behind
us
and
turned
the
key
it
was
a
relief
to
get
outside
even
into
that
dismal
cabin
beyond
view
of
estada
dead
face
the
vessel
rolled
considerably
and
levere
who
had
evidently
lost
his
nerve
sank
into
a
chair
as
though
no
strength
remained
in
him
you
fear
an
uprising
a
mutiny
i
questioned
when
this
is
reported
what
will
prevent
he
asked
the
captain
can
not
stir
the
mate
dead
the
men
already
crazed
because
we
take
no
prizes
they
will
murder
us
also
and
take
control
who
will
those
devils
amidships
ay
they
care
only
to
fight
for
gold
it
is
their
trade
and
who
leads
them
who
would
they
make
captain
manuel
estevan
he
whispered
he
would
be
the
one
i
thought
as
much
then
it
is
manuel
estevan
we
must
secure
first
before
they
know
is
my
thought
he
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
and
our
hope
lies
in
our
early
discovery
if
we
can
act
before
he
does
we
may
thwart
his
plan
listen
levere
i
will
speak
low
for
that
forward
stateroom
is
his
he
has
not
supposed
we
would
discover
the
murder
so
quickly
for
he
knew
nothing
of
estada
request
that
he
be
called
at
daylight
is
this
true
si
senor
it
was
his
last
order
when
he
went
below
good
then
we
must
organize
before
he
can
act
we
have
that
one
chance
left
whatever
his
men
may
know
of
what
has
occurred
they
will
make
no
move
until
they
get
his
orders
we
must
stop
the
possibility
of
his
issuing
any
without
a
leader
the
advantage
is
ours
you
mean
to
kill
him
only
as
a
last
resort
i
am
no
murderer
although
there
is
enough
at
stake
here
to
make
me
willing
to
take
life
there
is
no
good
feeling
between
those
quartered
amidships
and
the
crew
no
senor
it
is
hate
generally
although
they
are
not
all
alike
the
real
sailors
are
mostly
captured
men
they
serve
to
save
their
lives
and
only
for
these
others
on
board
could
not
be
held
long
we
do
not
arm
them
or
use
them
to
board
prizes
it
those
devils
amidships
who
loot
that
is
all
their
work
to
fight
and
guard
these
others
naturally
there
no
love
lost
between
them
your
plan
senor
is
to
set
the
one
against
the
other
yes
if
possible
i
know
no
other
way
these
sailor
men
are
of
all
races
can
they
be
trusted
he
sat
bending
forward
his
hands
on
his
knees
his
dark
face
far
from
pleasant
i
had
every
reason
to
know
the
fellow
to
be
criminal
desperate
guilty
of
everything
in
the
calendar
and
yet
i
must
place
confidence
in
him
only
as
we
worked
together
now
was
there
any
prospect
of
success
some
might
be
it
is
hard
to
tell
how
many
it
is
not
the
race
which
counts
so
much
senor
there
are
those
among
them
who
would
not
care
to
return
to
honesty
and
you
levere
he
spread
his
hands
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
is
no
hope
of
me
i
was
born
to
the
free
life
what
then
is
it
with
you
hate
senor
revenge
and
his
teeth
gleamed
savagely
i
would
spit
on
this
manuel
who
seeks
to
be
chief
i
can
never
be
i
am
of
black
skin
with
negro
blood
in
my
veins
and
white
men
would
never
have
it
so
but
i
can
hate
senor
that
is
why
i
am
with
you
now
if
the
devil
so
will
your
plan
might
work
tell
me
more
of
it
it
is
simple
enough
levere
and
came
to
me
but
now
as
i
looked
upon
estada
lying
there
dead
treachery
killed
him
and
that
treachery
must
have
purpose
behind
it
you
believe
this
to
be
the
ambition
of
manuel
estevan
to
become
chief
and
that
in
this
he
is
backed
by
those
buccaneers
amidships
whom
he
commands
but
to
accomplish
this
end
there
must
soon
be
other
murders
aboard
the
captain
sanchez
and
possibly
our
own
as
well
although
is
likely
he
may
offer
us
life
to
join
him
but
i
doubt
if
the
fellow
be
ready
yet
to
throw
off
the
mask
and
openly
declare
himself
he
will
claim
the
murder
of
estada
to
be
the
act
of
some
fiendish
member
of
the
crew
and
wait
until
things
aboard
ripen
to
his
purpose
he
is
not
likely
to
dream
that
we
suspect
him
this
gives
us
our
chance
we
can
act
before
he
does
but
if
the
men
are
with
him
what
are
the
odds
say
you
thirty
to
a
hundred
ay
but
surprise
will
overcome
that
my
plan
is
this
first
for
you
and
i
to
secure
manuel
as
quietly
as
possible
but
at
whatever
cost
surely
that
can
be
done
with
him
in
our
hands
or
dead
the
buccaneers
have
no
leader
what
then
there
are
men
in
the
crew
on
deck
and
in
the
forecastle
to
be
trusted
watkins
is
one
and
he
will
know
others
a
dozen
no
doubt
they
will
be
enough
we
will
whisper
the
truth
to
these
and
have
them
ready
for
a
signal
the
forward
door
from
amidships
is
closed
by
iron
bars
is
it
not
si
senor
his
eyes
again
sparkling
with
interest
the
men
quarreled
and
there
was
fighting
then
there
is
no
escape
in
that
direction
and
it
can
be
no
great
task
to
close
any
passage
leading
aft
lower
the
deck
hatch
and
we
have
those
devils
below
caged
like
so
many
rats
there
need
be
no
fighting
starvation
will
bring
them
to
terms
but
senor
you
forget
your
dozen
men
can
not
guard
the
buccaneers
below
and
also
manage
the
bark
at
sea
the
crew
are
not
all
lambs
many
will
sympathize
with
those
thus
locked
beneath
deck
cochose
is
bad
and
a
friend
of
manuel
he
will
fight
and
there
are
others
to
back
him
i
know
that
levere
the
whole
plan
is
desperate
but
there
is
no
other
possible
here
is
my
scheme
there
is
a
gun
rack
in
the
cabin
containing
enough
weapons
to
arm
the
dozen
men
we
can
trust
the
others
have
nothing
but
their
sheath
knives
the
buccaneers
can
be
secured
below
before
these
other
lads
ever
realize
what
is
happening
many
will
be
asleep
in
the
forecastle
as
soon
as
we
have
control
of
the
ship
we
round
them
up
forward
they
wo
dare
face
the
guns
i
give
them
their
choice
and
as
for
cochose
i
taken
his
measure
once
already
and
am
ready
to
try
it
again
and
what
will
you
tell
them
senor
i
caught
my
breath
conscious
of
his
meaning
my
secret
hope
could
not
be
revealed
to
this
fellow
however
hate
and
ambition
might
sway
him
and
however
personal
fear
might
influence
him
at
the
moment
his
purpose
and
mine
were
entirely
different
piracy
was
his
life
he
knew
and
cared
for
nothing
else
in
innate
savagery
he
was
not
better
than
any
of
the
others
and
must
be
dealt
with
accordingly
just
now
i
must
have
him
on
my
side
and
conditions
had
delivered
him
into
my
hands
but
i
could
only
hope
to
retain
him
through
self
interest
the
mulatto
had
little
faith
in
me
i
was
a
stranger
an
englishman
unknown
and
untried
naturally
we
were
enemies
he
would
make
use
of
me
for
the
present
if
he
could
and
as
smilingly
knife
me
tomorrow
if
it
served
his
turn
i
felt
confident
of
that
and
in
consequence
the
answer
came
quickly
to
my
lips
the
whole
truth
senor
levere
that
manuel
conspired
to
seize
the
bark
through
a
mutiny
of
the
buccaneers
that
these
were
to
be
turned
loose
with
license
to
kill
anyone
on
board
who
opposed
them
that
their
real
purpose
was
to
divide
among
themselves
all
the
treasure
below
then
wreck
the
vessel
and
escape
with
it
that
to
this
end
estada
had
already
been
foully
murdered
and
that
they
also
intended
to
take
the
lives
of
the
other
officers
so
as
to
be
free
to
do
as
they
pleased
i
shall
explain
that
we
discovered
this
conspiracy
just
in
time
to
save
them
from
butchery
and
that
they
must
stand
by
us
or
else
submit
to
those
i
put
it
strong
and
after
that
senor
why
porto
grande
of
course
i
admitted
heartily
it
is
not
a
long
voyage
and
if
we
bring
the
boat
in
safely
the
treasure
is
ours
the
men
will
understand
what
that
means
a
handful
of
gold
for
each
of
them
and
a
run
ashore
why
levere
they
will
make
more
apiece
than
by
looting
a
half
dozen
ships
and
with
no
fighting
it
will
be
a
fortune
for
you
and
me
his
somber
eyes
lighted
up
startled
by
this
new
idea
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
swaying
before
me
to
the
pitch
of
the
deck
you
mean
that
senor
we
divide
what
is
below
and
sail
for
porto
grande
i
hear
you
right
you
not
mean
surrender
you
stay
pirate
i
laughed
my
nerves
tingling
to
the
success
of
my
ruse
he
had
taken
the
tempting
bait
like
a
hungry
fish
why
of
course
so
that
was
the
trouble
hell
man
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
throw
away
this
chance
i
came
aboard
here
without
a
dollar
drunk
a
sailor
before
the
mast
look
at
me
now
into
a
job
as
first
officer
with
my
full
share
of
all
we
can
lay
hands
on
do
you
suppose
i
going
back
to
the
forecastle
and
a
bit
of
silver
not
me
i
for
all
i
can
get
and
with
no
care
how
i
get
it
this
is
our
chance
levere
if
we
put
the
into
porto
grande
with
sanchez
on
board
and
alive
and
those
locked
below
get
anything
we
ask
for
we
be
the
cocks
of
the
walk
if
he
should
live
through
why
then
we
have
a
ship
and
can
run
the
game
alone
either
way
if
we
win
the
prize
is
ours
and
by
god
if
we
stick
together
we
win
my
apparent
enthusiasm
caught
the
fellow
i
could
read
the
working
of
his
mind
in
his
face
this
was
a
new
view
of
the
situation
a
new
vision
it
appealed
to
him
from
every
standpoint
it
promised
wealth
power
the
total
defeat
of
estevan
everything
he
most
desired
and
as
i
pictured
it
the
result
seemed
easy
of
attainment
his
eyes
gleamed
lightning
you
think
senor
sanchez
live
what
difference
if
he
lives
he
owes
his
life
to
us
if
he
dies
the
bark
is
in
our
hands
and
the
treasure
the
thing
to
consider
now
is
how
to
get
control
once
we
have
won
we
care
nothing
if
he
live
or
die
come
we
have
wasted
time
enough
in
talk
it
is
action
that
counts
what
say
you
are
we
together
in
this
he
thrust
out
a
lean
yellow
hand
and
i
gripped
it
firmly
si
senor
you
speak
right
to
do
this
we
must
act
i
am
with
you
you
pledge
your
word
francois
i
pledge
it
senor
good
and
you
have
mine
now
to
the
work
first
manuel
estevan
and
then
the
men
on
deck
is
his
stateroom
yonder
chapter
xix
laying
the
trap
our
first
job
was
executed
much
more
easily
than
i
had
anticipated
we
caught
manuel
sound
asleep
and
levere
had
sinewy
hands
at
his
throat
before
the
fellow
could
grasp
a
weapon
or
even
clearly
comprehend
the
nature
of
the
attack
the
narrowness
of
the
stateroom
prevented
my
taking
much
part
in
the
affair
but
the
mulatto
needed
no
help
as
he
dragged
the
cursing
spaniard
from
his
bunk
to
the
deck
and
throttled
him
savagely
indeed
he
would
have
killed
the
fellow
had
i
not
interfered
and
twisted
his
hands
loose
leaving
estevan
barely
conscious
a
blanket
ripped
into
strips
served
to
bind
him
securely
enough
for
the
present
but
i
thought
it
best
to
lock
the
door
and
keep
the
key
in
my
own
pocket
levere
would
have
knifed
him
even
as
he
lay
there
helpless
but
for
my
threat
and
insistence
once
back
in
the
cabin
my
eyes
distinguished
the
frightened
face
of
the
steward
peering
forth
at
us
from
out
the
dark
of
the
passage
leading
forward
come
here
gunsaules
i
said
sternly
step
lively
lad
nothing
for
you
to
fear
yes
senor
yes
and
he
crept
forth
from
his
partial
cover
glancing
fearfully
from
face
to
face
as
he
advanced
senor
estada
has
been
killed
during
the
night
and
we
have
just
captured
his
murderer
i
explained
hastily
there
is
reason
to
believe
this
act
was
part
of
a
conspiracy
to
seize
the
ship
by
senor
manuel
his
eyes
staring
at
me
from
out
a
white
face
yes
in
connection
with
those
fellows
amidships
does
that
passage
lead
to
their
quarters
it
did
once
senor
but
now
there
is
a
closed
door
the
captain
sanchez
had
it
so
arranged
to
prevent
the
men
from
coming
aft
what
kind
of
a
door
of
oak
studded
with
iron
not
only
locked
but
barred
on
this
side
you
have
no
key
no
senor
there
are
but
two
one
for
the
captain
and
the
other
for
him
who
commands
the
buccaneers
manuel
si
senor
i
stood
there
a
moment
silent
considering
this
information
and
rapidly
arranging
in
mind
our
future
operations
the
only
way
the
mutineers
could
reach
the
cabin
then
would
be
from
the
deck
descending
through
the
companion
so
long
as
they
remained
unaware
of
the
capture
of
manuel
there
was
little
danger
of
their
taking
such
action
my
faith
in
gunsaules
was
not
great
yet
the
probability
was
that
he
would
remain
loyal
to
whichever
party
held
the
upper
hand
that
was
ever
the
way
with
these
men
very
well
steward
i
said
you
go
on
about
your
work
as
though
nothing
had
happened
if
any
word
of
this
affair
gets
to
the
crew
or
to
those
fellows
forward
i
hold
you
responsible
understand
that
si
senor
you
are
not
to
leave
this
cabin
without
my
permission
nor
speak
to
anyone
levere
the
mulatto
faced
me
respectfully
enough
and
i
had
a
feeling
he
would
obey
orders
largely
because
he
dare
not
rebel
si
senor
they
will
be
wondering
why
you
are
not
on
deck
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
take
charge
of
the
watch
at
once
and
keep
the
men
busy
relieve
watkins
at
the
wheel
and
send
the
man
down
to
me
he
can
choose
the
fellows
who
will
stick
better
than
you
could
and
then
can
circulate
among
them
without
arousing
suspicion
send
him
down
at
once
quietly
he
disappeared
through
the
companion
while
gunsaules
vanished
within
the
storeroom
where
i
could
hear
him
rummaging
noisily
about
i
sat
down
to
wait
the
appearance
of
watkins
satisfied
that
matters
were
already
safely
in
my
control
that
the
english
sailor
would
cooperate
i
had
no
doubt
and
as
to
levere
he
had
already
gone
too
far
to
openly
play
the
traitor
it
was
full
daylight
now
and
evidently
a
bright
morning
although
the
swell
of
the
sea
remained
heavy
and
i
judged
there
must
be
a
strong
wind
watkins
muffled
to
the
ears
in
a
heavy
jacket
and
with
cap
pulled
down
so
i
could
scarcely
see
his
face
shuffled
down
the
steps
he
whipped
off
the
cap
and
stood
waiting
the
officer
of
the
deck
sent
me
here
sir
i
asked
for
you
did
levere
tell
you
why
no
sir
only
that
i
was
to
come
at
once
and
quietly
i
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
tom
i
said
soberly
but
so
low
i
felt
sure
even
gunsaules
would
not
overhear
we
are
in
the
same
boat
and
understand
each
other
the
chance
has
come
for
both
of
us
if
we
play
the
cards
right
listen
while
i
tell
you
the
situation
and
what
i
plan
doing
i
told
it
briefly
wasting
no
words
yet
relating
every
fact
even
including
my
visit
and
conversation
with
dorothy
and
the
throwing
of
the
body
through
the
after
port
he
listened
eagerly
but
without
interruption
until
the
end
what
do
you
make
of
it
i
asked
irritated
by
his
silence
about
what
you
do
sir
i
knew
there
was
something
of
the
kind
going
on
some
of
the
men
forward
are
in
on
it
you
got
the
manuel
you
mean
who
did
he
count
on
for
help
in
the
forecastle
cochose
and
a
handful
of
others
niggers
and
spaniards
mostly
they
even
tried
out
one
or
two
white
men
that
how
i
heard
of
it
through
jack
jones
but
they
never
told
him
enough
to
make
the
plan
clear
however
with
what
you
just
said
i
got
a
pretty
fair
understanding
they
meant
to
pull
the
affair
off
either
today
or
tonight
what
sorter
lookin
chap
was
the
fellow
you
knocked
out
sir
i
scarcely
saw
his
face
a
i
should
say
rather
short
but
stout
with
long
hair
jose
he
is
the
one
manuel
would
choose
for
such
a
job
but
why
he
got
into
the
girl
room
is
more
than
i
know
however
if
he
is
dead
and
manuel
a
prisoner
it
gives
us
a
fair
chance
sir
it
leaves
those
fellows
amidships
without
a
leader
a
dozen
good
men
on
deck
might
do
the
business
but
are
there
a
dozen
aboard
to
be
trusted
he
hesitated
running
the
names
over
in
his
mind
evidently
weighing
each
one
carefully
well
yes
sir
i
rather
think
there
are
he
said
finally
it
do
for
to
make
any
mistake
here
but
i
pretty
sure
of
these
fellows
i
say
that
in
both
watches
there
maybe
fourteen
to
be
relied
on
there
one
or
two
others
in
the
starboard
watch
who
are
likely
enough
all
right
but
i
do
get
to
see
them
alone
much
who
do
you
pick
out
in
my
watch
there
jones
harwood
and
simms
either
english
or
welsh
they
all
right
then
there
a
nigger
named
sam
schmitt
a
dutchman
with
his
partner
whose
name
i
do
know
and
two
frenchies
ravel
and
pierre
that
makes
eight
nine
counting
myself
then
in
the
starboard
watch
i
pick
out
jim
carter
and
joe
cole
two
swedes
carlson
and
ole
hallin
and
another
nigger
then
there
are
a
couple
of
finns
who
ought
to
be
with
us
but
i
ca
talk
their
lingo
that
would
give
us
sixteen
out
of
thirty
and
it
quite
likely
some
of
the
others
would
take
a
hand
with
us
if
they
thought
it
was
safe
i
any
use
though
sir
for
francois
levere
there
ai
a
worse
scamp
aboard
i
know
that
i
admitted
but
he
had
to
be
used
it
was
through
him
that
estada
murder
was
discovered
but
he
is
safe
enough
for
the
present
for
he
made
the
attack
on
manuel
and
so
will
not
dare
go
back
on
us
his
life
is
in
the
balance
but
wait
tom
do
breathe
in
his
ear
our
real
purpose
i
convinced
him
that
we
mean
to
keep
in
the
trade
dividing
the
treasure
aboard
and
sailing
the
bark
to
porto
grande
oh
so
that
the
game
and
what
is
my
part
now
this
is
my
watch
below
and
it
will
be
best
for
me
to
keep
off
the
deck
until
all
is
prepared
besides
i
am
afraid
to
leave
the
cabin
unguarded
there
is
no
knowing
what
gunsaules
might
do
you
sound
these
men
and
get
them
together
wake
up
the
ones
in
the
starboard
watch
you
feel
sure
are
all
right
and
have
them
slip
quietly
on
deck
levere
will
understand
what
you
are
up
to
and
will
make
no
objection
as
soon
as
you
have
everything
ready
let
me
know
we
are
none
of
us
armed
sir
that
is
what
i
was
coming
to
when
you
are
sure
of
your
men
and
have
them
on
deck
i
get
levere
to
send
them
all
aft
on
some
pretext
or
other
i
think
up
a
way
to
do
this
without
creating
any
suspicion
then
we
get
these
arms
in
the
rack
here
and
be
ready
for
business
the
rest
will
be
done
in
a
hurry
you
have
it
all
clear
yes
sir
then
i
wait
here
for
your
report
at
the
very
best
watkins
could
scarcely
perform
the
task
assigned
him
in
less
than
an
hour
no
doubt
there
were
those
on
his
list
whom
he
would
have
to
approach
with
great
caution
while
there
was
always
danger
that
some
word
might
be
dropped
to
awaken
suspicion
the
success
or
failure
of
our
effort
depended
entirely
upon
taking
these
fellows
by
complete
surprise
if
it
came
to
an
open
fight
our
cause
was
hopeless
for
that
would
mean
fourteen
or
fifteen
men
unarmed
pitted
against
over
a
hundred
thoroughly
equipped
and
trained
fighters
to
be
sure
these
were
at
present
without
a
leader
yet
their
force
alone
was
sufficient
to
overcome
us
and
some
one
among
them
would
doubtless
assume
leadership
in
an
emergency
only
by
confining
them
below
with
hatches
battened
down
and
a
carronade
trained
upon
them
would
we
be
safe
i
sat
where
i
could
watch
the
stairs
and
the
entire
forward
part
of
the
cabin
gunsaules
lowered
the
table
and
began
preparing
the
morning
meal
he
glanced
at
me
each
time
he
passed
but
ventured
on
no
questioning
although
it
was
quite
evident
the
fellow
was
nearly
bursting
from
curiosity
i
lit
my
pipe
endeavoring
to
appear
entirely
at
ease
as
i
turned
over
and
over
again
in
mind
every
detail
of
the
contemplated
action
with
each
review
the
result
seemed
more
certainly
assured
and
my
courage
revived
except
for
some
accident
or
act
of
treachery
i
could
perceive
no
reason
why
my
plan
should
not
work
perfectly
it
was
evident
that
levere
was
endeavoring
to
keep
the
watch
on
deck
busy
i
could
hear
his
voice
frequently
calling
out
orders
and
occasionally
singling
out
some
man
for
a
special
task
a
slushing
of
water
proved
that
the
deck
amidships
was
being
washed
down
and
twice
at
least
men
were
sent
aloft
to
make
some
change
in
the
spread
of
canvas
i
stepped
across
into
my
stateroom
to
gain
a
glimpse
out
through
the
port
narrow
as
the
vista
was
it
yet
revealed
a
beautiful
sea
view
the
waves
running
high
but
in
long
billows
with
bright
sunshine
glowing
along
their
crests
the
hollows
a
deep
purple
above
the
sky
was
a
pale
blue
with
scarcely
a
fleeting
cloud
visible
and
the
bark
was
sailing
free
laying
well
over
to
the
fresh
breeze
evidently
carrying
all
the
spread
of
canvas
possible
as
i
returned
to
the
cabin
gunsaules
awaited
me
to
announce
breakfast
what
already
it
is
senor
those
were
my
orders
very
well
i
suppose
estada
and
manuel
usually
eat
first
si
senor
that
leaves
me
alone
suppose
you
rap
on
the
lady
door
yonder
and
ask
if
she
will
join
me
say
your
message
is
from
senor
gates
she
came
forth
immediately
fully
dressed
but
bearing
herself
with
reserve
on
my
part
i
made
no
effort
at
greeting
not
certain
as
to
what
eyes
might
be
observing
us
through
the
deck
light
above
or
for
the
matter
of
that
unwilling
to
face
the
curiosity
of
the
watchful
steward
i
had
you
called
i
explained
because
of
a
disinclination
to
eat
entirely
alone
you
were
evidently
awake
yes
i
have
not
undressed
i
felt
no
desire
to
sleep
although
no
doubt
i
dozed
the
call
to
breakfast
was
quite
welcome
she
seated
herself
opposite
me
and
we
spoke
of
the
weather
while
gunsaules
served
with
some
skill
he
was
still
hovering
about
but
my
anxiety
to
enjoy
a
word
with
her
alone
caused
me
to
send
him
on
a
task
elsewhere
has
captain
sanchez
been
attended
to
yet
i
asked
sharply
no
then
see
to
him
at
once
i
have
reason
to
believe
he
is
alone
this
morning
and
will
need
you
yes
we
can
get
along
very
nicely
we
waited
until
he
disappeared
within
the
after
stateroom
bearing
a
tray
then
her
eyes
suddenly
lifted
to
mine
filled
with
questioning
tell
me
what
has
happened
she
breathed
eagerly
i
heard
the
noise
of
a
struggle
out
here
and
voices
conversing
why
are
you
alone
i
leaned
over
to
speak
in
as
low
a
tone
as
possible
i
can
only
explain
very
briefly
the
man
who
came
into
your
room
last
night
had
just
murdered
estada
levere
and
i
found
the
mate
body
at
daylight
his
killing
was
part
of
a
plot
by
manuel
and
the
buccaneers
quartered
amidships
to
seize
the
bark
we
have
manuel
already
prisoner
and
are
preparing
to
gain
possession
of
the
boat
ourselves
who
are
planning
you
have
found
friends
on
board
i
have
made
levere
believe
his
only
safety
lies
in
assisting
me
i
told
you
about
watkins
and
the
other
men
forward
he
has
picked
out
a
dozen
or
so
in
whom
he
has
confidence
english
sailors
mostly
and
is
sounding
them
out
i
expect
him
back
with
a
report
at
any
minute
and
then
what
her
excitement
visible
in
her
eyes
what
can
a
dozen
men
do
our
main
weapon
is
surprise
of
course
by
acting
quickly
we
can
gain
control
of
the
deck
if
watkins
estimate
is
correct
nine
out
of
the
port
watch
now
on
duty
will
be
with
us
if
he
can
add
to
these
five
or
six
from
the
starboard
watch
below
this
will
make
a
total
not
counting
levere
and
myself
of
fifteen
there
would
be
only
five
left
to
oppose
us
on
deck
and
probably
two
of
these
would
be
on
watch
aloft
once
we
gain
control
of
the
deck
we
can
lock
the
others
below
and
negotiate
with
them
at
our
leisure
the
plan
looks
to
me
quite
possible
she
sat
silently
gazing
at
me
across
the
table
seemingly
failing
to
quite
comprehend
her
parted
lips
trembling
to
an
unasked
question
before
she
could
frame
this
in
words
the
door
to
the
companion
opened
and
watkins
descended
the
stairs
at
sight
of
her
he
whipped
off
his
cap
and
stood
motionless
fumbling
it
awkwardly
in
his
hands
you
may
speak
freely
i
said
this
is
the
young
lady
i
told
you
about
and
of
course
she
is
with
us
only
talk
low
as
the
steward
is
in
the
stateroom
yonder
yes
sir
using
a
hoarse
whisper
and
fastening
his
gaze
on
me
all
right
sir
they
are
with
us
how
many
eight
sure
from
my
watch
sir
harwood
is
in
the
and
could
be
seen
but
i
answer
for
his
bein
all
right
there
was
only
four
i
could
get
word
to
in
the
forcastle
but
there
others
there
who
give
us
help
soon
as
they
know
what
goin
on
that
makes
twelve
of
the
men
fifteen
of
us
altogether
are
the
four
from
the
starboard
watch
on
deck
he
nodded
clutching
and
unclutching
his
hands
nervously
scarcely
able
to
restrain
himself
chapter
xx
the
deck
is
ours
i
had
the
next
step
carefully
outlined
in
my
own
mind
and
yet
i
hesitated
a
moment
glancing
into
the
two
faces
before
me
with
a
sudden
realization
of
what
the
contemplated
action
would
mean
to
all
of
us
if
by
any
chance
it
should
fail
of
success
our
lives
certainly
hung
in
the
balance
for
these
fiends
would
show
no
mercy
if
once
they
gained
power
to
strike
back
yet
how
could
we
fail
only
through
treachery
or
some
unforseen
accident
and
moreover
it
was
too
late
for
retreat
the
one
chance
desperate
as
it
appeared
must
be
taken
i
managed
to
speak
cheerfully
putting
a
ring
of
confidence
into
my
voice
then
the
sooner
we
act
the
better
watkins
have
levere
order
these
men
aft
let
him
say
that
senor
estada
wishes
them
to
break
out
some
stores
in
the
lazaret
that
will
create
no
suspicion
they
need
be
here
only
long
enough
for
us
to
distribute
these
arms
among
them
and
for
me
to
speak
a
word
of
instruction
to
them
are
you
ready
ay
ay
sir
as
he
vanished
i
turned
to
the
girl
who
had
arisen
to
her
feet
one
hand
grasping
the
edge
of
the
table
to
balance
herself
against
the
pitching
of
the
deck
it
is
a
desperate
chance
is
it
not
she
questioned
anxiously
yes
i
admitted
fifteen
of
us
against
a
hundred
and
fifteen
but
worth
taking
and
such
an
opportunity
may
never
occur
again
i
believe
the
plan
will
work
its
greatest
weakness
is
i
do
not
know
the
men
on
whom
i
must
rely
if
there
should
be
a
traitor
among
them
we
are
done
for
i
mean
to
work
so
fast
no
one
man
will
be
able
to
spread
the
news
but
have
i
no
part
is
there
no
way
in
which
i
can
help
you
have
your
pistol
yes
then
remain
here
i
shall
have
to
go
on
deck
with
the
men
and
will
not
dare
leave
them
a
moment
until
the
ship
is
absolutely
secure
manuel
is
locked
in
that
stateroom
but
must
not
be
communicated
with
by
anyone
i
hardly
believe
gunsaules
will
attempt
anything
but
it
is
not
safe
to
trust
him
alone
it
will
be
your
part
to
see
that
the
fellow
neither
enters
that
passage
leading
amidships
nor
approaches
this
door
keep
him
in
sight
you
can
do
this
of
course
i
can
then
you
will
do
most
valuable
service
and
save
us
a
man
wait
here
now
until
i
see
how
securely
this
passage
forward
is
closed
it
was
as
described
to
me
a
heavy
oaken
door
nail
studded
not
only
locked
but
held
firmly
in
place
by
a
stout
iron
bar
there
was
not
the
faintest
possibility
of
any
entrance
aft
except
through
assistance
from
this
side
as
i
returned
to
the
cabin
gunsaules
came
out
of
the
captain
room
and
crossed
the
deck
at
sight
of
me
he
stopped
instantly
holding
his
tray
in
front
of
him
gunsaules
i
said
wasting
no
words
you
are
to
remain
in
this
cabin
until
i
give
the
word
the
lady
here
has
a
pistol
and
orders
to
shoot
if
you
attempt
to
either
enter
this
passage
or
approach
the
door
of
manuel
stateroom
yes
senor
his
face
like
chalk
and
his
eyes
rolling
how
did
you
find
sanchez
sitting
up
in
his
bunk
senor
and
able
to
eat
does
he
know
what
is
occurring
on
board
no
senor
he
questioned
me
but
i
only
told
him
everything
was
all
right
so
far
in
my
heart
i
believed
the
fellow
deliberately
lied
but
there
was
no
opportunity
to
question
him
further
for
at
that
moment
the
door
of
the
companion
opened
and
a
miscellaneous
group
of
men
thronged
down
the
stairs
they
were
a
rough
hairy
lot
here
and
there
a
sturdy
english
countenance
meeting
my
gaze
but
the
faces
were
largely
foreign
with
those
of
two
negroes
conspicuous
i
felt
my
heart
beat
furiously
at
sight
of
such
poor
material
and
yet
many
a
ship
crew
appeared
worse
the
fellows
grouped
themselves
awkwardly
behind
watkins
twelve
here
sir
i
could
get
harwood
down
from
the
and
there
are
others
below
who
will
join
us
yes
sir
six
more
i
count
on
which
means
lads
that
with
harwood
senor
levere
and
myself
total
in
this
shindy
now
i
tell
you
what
is
up
watkins
gave
you
some
of
it
no
doubt
but
a
word
from
me
will
make
it
clearer
i
no
pirate
i
an
english
sailor
shanghied
on
board
estada
named
me
first
officer
because
i
understand
navigation
i
stopped
speaking
staring
at
one
of
the
faces
before
me
all
at
once
it
appeared
familiar
what
is
your
name
my
man
jim
carter
sir
you
were
in
the
crew
of
the
three
years
ago
i
was
that
mister
carlyle
he
answered
grinning
i
know
you
the
minute
i
cum
down
yere
then
that
is
all
i
need
say
on
that
line
here
one
of
your
mates
lads
who
will
vouch
for
me
now
as
i
been
told
you
are
all
of
you
in
the
same
boat
you
are
prisoners
on
board
cowed
by
those
mongrel
devils
amidships
do
you
understand
what
i
say
if
ye
put
it
in
spanish
sir
said
carter
respectfully
an
talk
kinder
slow
they
most
ov
catch
the
meanin
that
all
the
lingo
we
heard
lately
very
well
now
listen
closely
all
of
you
luck
has
given
us
a
chance
to
make
a
break
and
get
away
captain
sanchez
is
wounded
and
helpless
pedro
estada
is
dead
and
i
got
manuel
locked
in
that
stateroom
his
are
all
below
and
now
all
we
got
to
do
is
clap
on
the
hatch
and
keep
them
there
what
the
nigger
on
watch
broke
in
jones
hoarsely
i
like
ter
crook
him
by
god
he
with
us
so
far
i
answer
for
him
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
are
you
fellows
with
me
watkins
answered
up
promptly
then
carter
the
others
joining
in
with
less
heartiness
the
different
accents
revealing
their
nationalities
i
knew
sailors
well
enough
to
feel
assured
they
would
follow
their
leaders
once
the
game
started
that
good
enough
now
we
got
to
hit
hard
and
quick
lads
there
are
six
men
on
deck
who
are
not
with
us
watkins
will
take
care
of
them
with
those
fellows
i
do
assign
to
other
work
jones
you
and
carter
make
straight
for
the
forecastle
and
do
let
anyone
come
up
the
scuttle
one
of
you
had
better
drop
down
below
and
prevent
any
of
those
lads
from
unbarring
the
door
leading
amidships
who
is
the
best
for
that
job
let
carlson
do
it
he
belongs
to
the
starboard
watch
all
right
carlson
it
is
then
you
frenchmen
and
the
two
negroes
your
part
will
be
to
ship
the
main
hatch
do
a
quick
job
and
clamp
it
down
tight
do
you
all
understand
just
what
you
are
to
do
the
responses
satisfied
me
i
come
down
to
you
carlson
as
soon
as
we
have
the
deck
it
ought
not
to
take
more
than
five
minutes
to
handle
those
lads
and
slew
around
a
carronade
now
do
be
afraid
to
hit
hard
watkins
you
and
carter
hand
out
the
cutlasses
from
the
rack
you
boys
will
handle
those
better
than
firearms
good
now
are
you
all
ready
there
was
a
low
murmur
of
voices
the
faces
watching
me
showing
their
increasing
excitement
and
eagerness
our
little
talk
had
served
to
arouse
their
confidence
in
my
leadership
and
with
gleaming
weapons
in
their
hands
they
became
volunteers
once
turned
loose
my
greatest
difficulty
might
be
to
restrain
them
rather
than
urge
them
on
revenge
for
past
wrongs
was
in
each
heart
and
they
welcomed
a
chance
to
strike
and
kill
i
whispered
a
parting
word
of
admonition
into
the
ear
of
dorothy
receiving
in
return
a
glance
from
her
eyes
which
gave
a
new
throb
to
my
heart
then
straightened
up
and
pistol
in
hand
pushed
my
way
through
the
throng
of
sailors
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
follow
me
lads
i
said
quietly
and
every
man
do
the
particular
thing
assigned
him
do
pay
any
attention
to
your
mates
do
your
part
and
then
wait
for
orders
come
on
now
we
emerged
through
the
companion
and
i
stepped
aside
as
the
others
rushed
by
there
was
no
shout
no
cheer
the
fellows
seeming
to
realize
the
desperate
nature
of
their
work
and
the
importance
of
surprise
they
were
outnumbered
five
to
one
and
their
only
hope
of
success
lay
in
rendering
their
opponents
helpless
before
they
could
rally
to
a
defense
all
the
hate
of
years
was
in
their
hearts
blazed
madly
in
their
eyes
they
were
tigers
leaping
at
the
throat
of
their
prey
yet
sane
enough
to
comprehend
even
in
their
that
they
must
act
together
it
was
over
so
quickly
i
scarcely
saw
it
all
my
memory
now
is
of
a
clear
sky
a
deck
almost
deserted
its
brass
work
glowing
in
the
sun
the
white
sails
above
bellowing
out
to
the
pressure
of
a
strong
wind
and
the
blue
sea
crested
with
white
stretching
about
us
in
desolate
grandeur
levere
stared
down
over
the
poop
rail
behind
him
the
motionless
figure
of
the
wheelsman
his
hands
gripping
the
spokes
while
across
the
open
deck
the
speeding
mutineers
leaped
to
their
several
posts
with
bare
cutlasses
shining
in
the
sun
and
they
did
their
work
my
eyes
swept
from
group
to
group
the
four
toiling
at
the
cover
of
the
main
hatch
the
fellows
racing
toward
the
forecastle
and
watkins
squad
driving
straight
into
the
grouped
watch
beyond
the
foremast
it
was
smartly
done
watkins
had
taken
no
cutlass
but
went
in
with
both
fists
asking
no
questions
but
battering
right
and
left
his
men
surging
after
with
steel
blades
flaming
in
the
sunlight
the
astounded
watch
cursing
and
fighting
grimly
held
for
a
moment
and
then
went
staggering
back
against
the
port
rail
unable
to
stem
the
rush
and
roaring
for
mercy
i
had
view
of
carlson
dropping
recklessly
down
the
forecastle
scuttle
and
then
sprang
forward
myself
to
give
a
hand
to
the
four
wrestling
with
the
main
hatch
together
we
dragged
it
into
position
forcing
relentlessly
back
as
we
did
so
a
dozen
struggling
figures
frantically
endeavoring
to
reach
the
deck
shots
were
fired
the
bullets
whistling
through
the
opening
the
flare
lighting
up
the
black
depths
below
revealing
vaguely
a
mass
of
frantic
men
staring
up
and
cursing
us
fiercely
in
a
dozen
languages
but
in
spite
of
them
we
clamped
the
hatch
down
tight
and
locked
it
securely
into
place
with
an
iron
bar
even
through
this
cover
the
sound
of
smothered
yells
reached
our
ears
mingled
with
blows
of
as
the
fellows
vainly
endeavored
to
break
out
from
their
prison
the
negro
sam
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
executing
a
jig
as
he
flashed
his
cutlass
above
his
head
stay
here
all
four
of
you
i
commanded
sharply
this
job
is
well
done
now
let
me
see
about
the
others
watkins
needed
no
help
he
had
his
party
rounded
up
and
in
complete
control
the
fellows
begging
for
mercy
as
they
crouched
before
the
cutlasses
of
their
assailants
to
my
orders
they
were
driven
into
the
cook
galley
and
a
guard
stationed
at
the
door
then
i
turned
to
the
more
serious
work
confronting
me
in
the
forecastle
what
lay
before
me
in
facing
the
members
of
the
starboard
watch
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
but
they
had
to
be
sorted
out
and
it
was
my
task
we
must
have
men
enough
to
sail
the
bark
and
if
i
was
to
command
them
i
must
first
of
all
prove
my
courage
and
enforce
authority
the
whole
success
of
our
effort
depended
on
this
what
going
on
below
i
asked
cursin
mostly
answered
carter
peering
down
through
a
slight
uptilting
of
the
scuttle
they
do
just
know
what
happening
yet
but
the
big
nigger
seems
ter
be
raisin
hell
carlson
is
a
holdin
him
back
with
his
cutlass
open
up
and
let
me
down
i
fell
rather
than
clambered
along
the
rungs
of
the
ladder
coming
to
my
feet
on
deck
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
angry
men
who
had
carlson
pinned
against
the
bulkhead
the
light
was
so
poor
i
could
scarcely
see
their
faces
a
babel
of
voices
greeted
me
and
more
than
one
hand
gripped
me
fiercely
as
the
excited
owner
yelped
a
demand
to
know
what
in
hell
we
were
up
to
i
roughly
cleared
a
space
aided
by
cutlass
and
fronted
them
defiantly
towering
above
them
all
his
black
apelike
face
distorted
with
rage
i
distinguished
the
giant
cochose
his
immense
hands
grasping
a
wooden
bar
ripped
from
a
bunk
plainly
enough
he
was
the
leader
the
one
man
whose
ascendency
i
must
crush
and
i
meant
to
do
it
then
and
there
this
was
no
job
i
could
turn
over
to
others
if
i
was
to
rule
this
black
brute
must
be
conquered
at
the
very
start
conquered
by
my
own
hands
and
in
the
presence
of
his
mates
here
in
this
black
forecastle
we
must
fight
it
out
breast
to
breast
as
savagely
as
beasts
of
the
jungle
to
the
bitter
end
i
made
the
resolve
with
teeth
clenched
and
every
muscle
throbbing
with
eagerness
stand
back
there
lads
i
said
sternly
my
eyes
searching
their
faces
and
with
pistol
poised
threateningly
give
us
room
explain
all
that
has
happened
presently
but
first
i
am
going
to
lick
that
black
brute
within
an
inch
of
his
life
step
out
of
there
cochose
he
came
grinning
widely
balancing
the
heavy
club
in
his
hands
you
mean
me
sah
you
all
think
yer
kin
lick
me
yes
i
think
so
i
try
it
anyway
here
carlson
take
this
pistol
and
sheath
knife
if
anyone
interferes
shoot
him
all
i
ask
is
fair
play
drop
that
club
cochose
and
throw
away
your
knife
you
and
i
will
fight
this
out
with
bare
hands
his
dull
brain
worked
slowly
and
he
stared
at
me
his
eyes
ugly
his
grin
becoming
savage
with
a
display
of
teeth
his
silence
and
lack
of
response
awoke
a
growl
from
the
impatient
circle
of
men
behind
one
fellow
kicked
the
club
out
of
his
hand
contemptuously
and
another
plucked
the
knife
from
his
belt
you
big
skulker
the
latter
said
with
an
oath
of
derision
go
on
and
fight
what
in
hell
are
you
afraid
of
what
for
ah
fight
this
white
man
ah
do
even
know
who
he
is
then
i
tell
you
estada
is
dead
manuel
is
a
prisoner
i
in
command
of
this
bark
and
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
lesson
for
the
benefit
of
the
crew
you
are
a
big
boasting
cur
i
heard
what
you
said
when
i
came
down
and
now
i
make
you
prove
it
you
other
fellows
stand
back
i
make
this
beast
fight
i
took
two
steps
forward
my
advance
so
swift
and
unexpected
the
big
negro
had
not
even
time
in
which
to
throw
up
an
arm
in
defense
with
open
hand
i
struck
him
squarely
across
the
face
an
insulting
stinging
blow
chapter
xxi
in
full
possession
a
roar
of
delight
mingled
with
the
negro
snarl
of
rage
at
this
action
for
an
instant
the
fellow
appeared
too
completely
surprised
for
movement
although
an
angry
oath
burst
from
his
lips
and
the
grin
of
derision
faded
from
his
face
i
knew
sailors
and
felt
that
these
men
would
not
differ
greatly
from
the
occupants
of
other
forecastles
on
the
seven
seas
they
would
welcome
a
fight
like
this
and
their
immediate
sympathy
would
be
with
me
for
starting
it
more
than
that
this
black
bully
ruling
over
them
by
brute
force
could
be
no
favorite
they
might
fear
him
but
with
that
fear
would
be
mingled
hate
and
a
delight
in
his
downfall
the
respite
was
short
yet
in
that
instant
although
i
can
not
recall
removing
watchful
eyes
from
the
negro
face
i
received
an
impression
of
my
surroundings
never
to
be
erased
from
memory
the
grim
picture
arises
before
me
now
distinct
in
every
detail
the
gloomy
interior
the
deck
foul
littered
with
sea
boots
and
discarded
clothing
and
the
great
beams
overhead
blackened
by
smoke
the
rays
of
the
swinging
slush
lantern
barely
illuminated
the
central
space
the
rows
of
bunks
beyond
remaining
mere
shadows
yet
this
dim
yellowish
light
fell
full
upon
the
excited
half
circle
of
men
who
were
roaring
about
the
negro
and
had
already
pressed
him
forward
until
he
stood
confronting
me
his
grin
of
derision
changed
into
a
scowl
of
hate
they
were
a
rough
wild
lot
bearded
and
uncombed
ranging
in
color
from
the
intense
black
of
central
africa
to
the
blond
of
scandinavia
half
naked
some
their
voices
mingling
in
a
dozen
tongues
their
eyes
gleaming
with
savagery
they
impressed
me
as
animals
of
the
jungle
thirsting
for
blood
and
i
knew
the
man
who
came
victorious
from
this
struggle
would
be
their
leader
the
thought
stiffened
my
muscles
and
strengthened
my
determination
to
win
i
know
not
whether
cochose
lunged
forward
of
his
own
volition
or
was
pressed
on
from
behind
yet
suddenly
he
was
within
reach
of
me
and
the
battle
was
on
it
was
short
and
fierce
his
object
evidently
being
to
crush
me
in
his
giant
grip
mine
to
oppose
science
to
strength
and
avoid
his
we
swayed
back
and
forth
to
the
sharp
pitching
of
the
ship
barely
able
to
keep
our
feet
sparring
for
some
advantage
once
he
would
have
had
me
but
for
a
lunge
of
the
vessel
which
sent
him
sprawling
on
hands
and
knees
yet
before
i
could
recover
the
man
was
up
again
furious
with
anger
this
time
he
sprang
straight
at
me
uttering
a
growl
of
rage
determined
to
smash
me
to
the
deck
by
the
very
power
of
his
onslaught
but
i
him
getting
in
two
swift
blows
which
rocked
his
head
and
tore
open
one
cheek
from
which
blood
trickled
yet
he
kept
his
feet
blindly
gripping
for
me
driven
almost
crazy
by
the
pain
of
my
last
blow
and
the
jeers
of
his
mates
i
evaded
his
clutch
by
leaping
aside
but
the
space
was
far
too
small
to
permit
these
tactics
to
carry
long
and
finally
he
had
me
yet
even
as
he
seemingly
crushed
the
very
breath
out
of
me
his
giant
strength
met
with
a
resistance
which
increased
his
fury
already
the
fellow
had
lost
his
head
but
i
fought
coolly
putting
my
skill
against
brute
force
every
wrestler
trick
i
knew
flashing
into
my
brain
breathless
my
flesh
scraped
and
bruised
i
wriggled
partly
free
and
tripped
him
his
great
body
striking
the
deck
with
a
thud
i
fell
with
him
dragged
down
by
his
desperate
grip
but
was
first
upon
my
feet
saluted
by
a
roar
of
delight
from
the
lips
of
those
crowding
about
us
as
he
staggered
up
also
cursing
fiercely
his
lips
drawn
back
in
a
snarl
his
brutal
face
that
of
a
wild
animal
i
struck
him
again
a
blow
which
would
have
ended
the
game
had
not
my
foot
slipped
on
the
reeling
deck
as
it
was
it
drove
him
to
his
knees
groggy
and
with
one
eye
half
closed
yet
with
strength
enough
left
to
regain
his
feet
as
soon
as
i
this
time
he
charged
me
like
a
wild
bull
froth
whitening
his
lips
scarcely
appearing
human
in
the
yellow
light
in
mad
rage
he
forgot
all
caution
all
pretense
at
defense
his
one
thought
to
reach
me
with
his
hands
and
throttle
me
into
lifeless
pulp
here
was
where
skill
and
coolness
won
i
fought
him
back
driving
blow
on
blow
through
his
guard
sidestepping
his
mad
rushes
landing
again
and
again
on
his
body
twice
i
got
in
over
his
heart
and
at
last
found
the
chance
i
sought
and
sent
a
right
jab
straight
to
the
chin
all
the
force
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
was
behind
the
clinched
fist
and
the
negro
went
down
as
though
floored
by
a
poleaxe
once
weakly
he
endeavored
to
rise
but
this
time
i
used
my
left
and
he
never
stirred
again
lying
there
with
no
sign
of
life
except
the
quivering
of
the
huge
body
assured
that
he
was
down
and
out
i
stood
above
him
gazing
into
the
ring
of
excited
faces
that
one
attended
to
i
said
shortly
now
is
there
any
more
of
you
who
would
like
to
fight
this
out
there
was
no
answer
although
the
ring
widened
under
the
threat
of
my
eyes
and
i
met
sullen
faces
here
and
there
i
was
in
no
mood
to
take
chances
carlson
i
said
glancing
back
at
him
you
know
all
these
men
yes
sir
pick
out
those
you
can
trust
and
have
them
stand
over
there
to
the
right
call
them
out
by
name
be
lively
now
they
stepped
forth
eagerly
enough
and
ranged
themselves
before
the
bunks
the
faces
mostly
those
of
northern
europe
although
a
negro
or
two
was
among
them
as
the
swede
ceased
calling
six
or
seven
yet
remained
clustered
in
front
of
me
a
motley
lot
one
of
them
an
indian
the
others
mostly
i
glanced
from
face
to
face
inquiringly
how
about
it
you
i
asked
are
there
any
more
of
you
fellows
who
take
a
chance
with
us
this
is
my
last
offer
what
the
game
asked
a
sullen
voice
in
english
and
a
bearded
fellow
burned
black
pushed
his
way
to
the
front
i
had
not
noted
his
presence
before
but
instantly
recognized
his
character
are
you
english
no
i
used
ter
be
scotch
now
i
damned
if
i
know
what
i
am
one

hell

an
whar

cum
frum

an
english
seaman
i
answered
shortly
and
how
i
came
aboard

no
difference
right
now
i
am
the
only
navigator
on
the
what
happened
ter
estada

last
night
by
one
of
the
buccaneers

a
hand
in
the
business
and
he
safely
locked
in
a
stateroom
aft
captain
sanchez

wounded
and
helpless
and
those
amidships
are
battened
down
below
hatches
levere
and
i
are
the
officers

and
we
control
the
deck

had
to
fight

out
or
likely
it
would
be
our
turn
next
yer
mean
those
fellers
were
aimin
ter
take
the
ship
exactly

now
where

bunch
of
pirates
or

ter
do
with
us
an
this
ship
that
the
question
i
had
not
decided
that
even
in
my
own
mind
but
the
answer
came
promptly
enough
as
my
eyes
swept
the
faces
fronting
me
what
your
name
ben
macclintock
well
macclintock
i
am
going
to
leave
that
to
the
crew
as
soon
as
we
have
all
secure
i
have
every
man
on
deck
and
then
we
talk
it
over
that
fair
enough
is
it
it
looks
fair
come
on
mates
i
fer
the
englishman
only
one
followed
him
however
a
boy
the
others
remained
sullen
and
defiant
likely
enough
they
failed
to
understand
what
had
been
said
but
i
had
no
further
time
to
waste
in
explanations
i
glanced
up
at
carter
face
framed
in
the
scuttle
hole
your
guard
there
ay
ay
sir
pass
these
men
up
and
take
them
forward
with
the
others
turn
them
over
to
watkins
then
come
back
here
and
report
to
me
ay
ay
sir
they
went
up
the
ladder
one
by
one
and
disappeared
onto
the
deck
above
the
majority
cheerful
enough
although
a
few
of
the
faces
were
scowling
darkly
as
they
passed
me
carlson
and
i
watched
the
others
the
swede
still
retaining
his
pistol
in
hand
until
carter
stuck
his
head
once
again
through
the
opening
all
safe
sir
they
was
like
lambs
very
well
stand
by
to
help
now
you
lads
lift
this
black
brute
and
shove
him
up
to
where
they
can
get
hold
above
step
lively
unless
you
want
trouble
show
them
the
way
carlson
it
was
some
heavy
job
but
they
finally
hoisted
the
unconscious
form
up
the
ladder
and
forced
it
through
the
hole
onto
the
deck
at
my
stern
command
the
others
also
crawled
forth
into
the
sunlight
where
carlson
and
i
followed
them
leaving
the
forecastle
deserted
i
felt
that
i
must
dispose
of
these
fellows
before
attempting
anything
else
and
scarcely
took
time
to
glance
about
they
were
huddled
in
a
little
bunch
around
the
outstretched
body
of
cochose
helpless
from
lack
of
leadership
pick
up
the
negro
yes
you
fellows
now
aft
with
him
all
of
you
we
halted
at
the
main
hatch
and
i
had
the
cover
slipped
to
one
side
the
armed
sailors
gathering
close
about
the
edge
as
i
peered
down
it
was
a
scene
of
pandemonium
revealed
in
the
yellow
flame
of
slush
lanterns
a
group
of
white
faces
showing
clearly
as
the
prisoners
below
struggled
forward
gesticulating
and
shouting
the
glow
of
light
glistened
on
a
variety
of
weapons
but
i
dare
not
send
men
below
into
the
midst
of
those
shrieking
devils
to
disarm
them
nor
was
i
greatly
afraid
of
the
result
at
present
they
must
still
be
in
total
ignorance
of
what
had
occurred
on
board
and
why
the
hatch
had
been
fastened
down
indeed
this
was
plainly
evidenced
by
their
cries
and
threats
they
were
leaderless
confused
unable
to
determine
what
to
attempt
while
they
remained
in
that
condition
they
could
not
greatly
endanger
my
plan
later
with
a
body
of
armed
seamen
behind
me
i
would
compel
the
surrender
of
weapons
but
now
i
must
hold
them
as
they
were
quarreling
among
themselves
and
take
time
to
strengthen
my
authority
on
deck
with
this
in
mind
ignoring
their
mad
roaring
and
the
threat
of
leveled
guns
i
stared
down
at
the
infuriated
faces
until
the
clamor
ceased
sufficiently
to
let
my
voice
be
heard
i
used
spanish
my
lack
of
facility
in
that
tongue
rendering
my
speech
slow
the
instant
silence
proved
my
words
understood
what
are
you
men
trying
to
do
frighten
me
you
might
as
well
stop
that
this
opening
is
lined
with
guns
and
if
one
of
you
fire
a
shot
we
pour
lead
into
you
more
than
that
if
you
attempt
to
climb
out
you
meet
a
hot
reception
there
is
a
brass
carronade
trained
on
the
hatch
to
sweep
you
to
kingdom
come
so
listen
several
voices
shouted
up
inquiries
but
one
shrill
and
insistent
rose
clearly
above
the
others
what
happening
what
yer
going
to
do
with
us
i
thought
i
located
the
questioner
among
the
jumbled
mass
below
and
with
my
eyes
on
him
answered
for
all
his
mates
we
are
in
control
of
the
ship
i
called
back
and
mean
to
keep
it
the
old
officers
are
either
dead
or
prisoners
what
we
do
with
you
will
depend
on
your
actions
but
we
ready
to
kill
if
necessary
if
you
keep
quiet
down
there
and
obey
orders
you
be
fed
and
treated
decently
enough
pass
up
your
arms
there
was
no
movement
only
a
glare
of
hostile
eyes
an
indistinguishable
growl
of
voices
kneel
down
lads
and
cover
those
fellows
i
ordered
sternly
drawing
my
own
pistol
now
you
below
there
this
is
my
last
word
i
count
ten
and
you
either
pass
up
those
weapons
or
we
pour
our
fire
into
you
if
your
miserable
lives
are
worth
anything
to
you
the
quicker
you
move
the
better
take
aim
boys
there
was
a
moment
of
deathly
silence
except
for
my
counting
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
trapped
prisoners
one
man
uttered
a
curse
and
the
jam
of
figures
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
endeavored
to
work
back
out
of
range
yet
before
i
had
spoken
the
word
eight
guns
were
held
aloft
and
poked
up
within
reach
and
at
this
sign
of
surrender
even
the
most
desperate
lost
heart
and
joined
the
more
cowardly
it
was
a
strange
collection
of
weapons
stacked
on
the
deck
guns
cutlasses
knives
and
pistols
of
every
description
relics
of
many
a
foray
some
apparently
very
old
probably
all
had
not
been
delivered
yet
there
was
such
a
pile
i
felt
no
further
fear
of
the
few
pieces
remaining
hidden
it
was
not
my
intention
that
the
villains
should
have
the
slightest
chance
to
use
the
weapons
so
when
the
stream
finally
ceased
i
asked
no
questions
although
i
gave
no
orders
to
the
guard
to
withdraw
i
had
the
fellows
cowed
and
meant
to
keep
them
so
that
all
is
it
very
well
now
you
men
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
take
care
of
this
big
nigger
we
sending
down
no
he
is
not
dead
only
stunned
let
him
have
a
bucket
of
water
and
he
be
all
right
now
stand
aside
while
a
few
of
your
friends
join
you
they
tell
you
what
up
make
room
there
we
passed
the
forecastle
scum
down
one
after
the
other
and
as
the
last
of
these
merged
into
the
scarcely
distinguishable
mass
below
i
gave
vent
to
a
sigh
of
relief
and
straightened
up
with
pistol
still
grasped
in
my
hand
they
were
now
bunched
together
all
of
them
and
confined
where
they
would
prove
the
least
possible
danger
desperate
and
reckless
as
many
of
them
were
we
had
them
now
safely
in
our
own
hands
disarmed
and
imprisoned
within
narrow
limits
to
be
sure
they
might
wreck
the
bark
by
fire
or
otherwise
but
that
would
only
peril
their
own
lives
and
no
matter
how
willing
some
might
be
to
accept
this
hazard
of
fortune
there
would
be
more
to
oppose
the
proposition
forcibly
if
necessary
for
them
to
escape
the
only
means
was
through
treachery
and
against
that
possibility
i
must
guard
i
knew
little
of
the
men
who
had
responded
to
my
call
and
chosen
me
as
leader
some
among
them
i
could
trust
but
others
were
merely
with
me
while
i
retained
power
would
desert
at
the
first
doubt
i
must
rely
on
the
judgment
of
watkins
as
to
whom
among
them
i
could
safely
depend
upon
and
suspicion
and
watch
the
rest
it
was
no
pleasant
position
yet
success
thus
far
had
come
so
easily
the
knowledge
was
no
discouragement
when
we
goin
ter
be
fed
yelled
a
voice
from
below
presently
i
answered
as
soon
as
the
cook
has
it
ready
shove
the
hatch
cover
back
into
place
lads
yes
it
will
be
safer
fastened
down
they
get
air
enough
through
treachery
and
against
that
possibility
i
must
caged
satisfied
that
every
precaution
had
been
taken
and
ignoring
the
indignant
roar
of
voices
which
greeted
this
order
i
watched
the
men
shift
the
heavy
hatch
cover
into
place
and
then
permitted
my
eyes
to
survey
the
deck
as
i
hastily
considered
our
next
action
chapter
xxii
the
crew
decides
except
that
many
of
the
men
remained
armed
there
was
no
suggestion
of
violence
visible
no
reminder
of
the
fact
that
we
were
mutineers
but
for
the
gleaming
carronade
trained
on
the
main
hatch
and
the
small
group
of
gunners
clustered
about
it
the
scene
was
peaceable
enough
resembling
the
deck
of
some
merchant
ship
the
bark
held
steadily
to
her
course
with
practically
every
inch
of
canvas
set
the
wind
steady
and
only
a
single
hand
at
the
wheel
levere
stood
motionless
at
the
poop
rail
staring
down
as
though
scarcely
realizing
what
had
transpired
on
board
and
some
way
his
very
attitude
and
expression
of
face
aroused
within
me
a
doubt
of
the
man
a
determination
to
put
him
to
the
test
evidently
he
had
held
aloof
and
cautiously
refrained
from
taking
even
the
slightest
part
in
our
activities
the
men
themselves
were
mostly
forward
grouped
together
and
still
excitedly
discussing
the
situation
that
all
among
them
were
not
satisfied
was
indicated
by
their
gestures
and
the
fact
that
watkins
and
others
of
the
more
loyal
were
passing
from
group
to
group
combating
their
arguments
plainly
enough
i
must
have
a
talk
with
the
fellows
outlining
a
plan
of
escape
and
leaving
them
to
imagine
their
choice
in
the
matter
would
be
followed
but
in
the
meanwhile
action
of
some
sort
would
be
most
apt
to
overcome
their
dissatisfaction
and
prevent
discussion
the
sky
overhead
was
a
pale
blue
the
sun
shining
but
as
through
a
slight
haze
while
a
heavy
cloud
of
vapor
obscured
the
western
horizon
although
this
promised
fog
rather
than
storm
yet
the
sea
had
a
heavy
swell
and
i
accepted
this
threat
of
a
change
in
weather
to
employ
the
men
in
reducing
sail
it
pleased
me
to
note
how
swiftly
they
responded
to
the
sound
of
my
voice
stand
by
to
reef
topsails
i
shouted
we
all
one
watch
now
go
at
it
lively
lads
and
when
the
job
is
over
we
eat
and
decide
together
what
our
next
move
two
of
you
will
be
enough
to
guard
the
hatch
and
you
carter
go
into
the
cabin
and
relieve
the
girl
there
keep
your
eyes
open
i
be
down
presently
aloft
with
you
and
see
how
quick
a
job
you
can
make
of
it
watkins
led
the
way
up
the
ratlines
and
cole
was
first
into
the
fore
shrouds
the
others
following
eagerly
i
watched
them
lay
out
on
the
yards
and
was
heartened
to
hear
the
fellows
sing
as
they
worked
the
canvas
melting
away
as
if
by
magic
only
three
men
remained
in
sight
on
the
main
deck
the
two
guarding
the
closed
hatch
and
one
watching
the
open
scuttle
leading
into
the
deserted
forecastle
back
and
forth
in
the
galley
the
cook
and
his
assistant
passed
the
open
door
and
carter
had
disappeared
through
the
companion
i
climbed
the
ladder
to
where
levere
stood
on
the
poop
but
carefully
ignored
his
presence
my
gaze
on
the
scene
aloft
twice
i
gave
orders
changing
the
steering
direction
slightly
and
commanding
the
lower
sails
reefed
the
mulatto
scowling
joined
me
at
the
rail
there
i
called
sharply
anything
to
report
no
sir
all
haze
off
the
port
quarter
and
nothing
showing
to
starboard
keep
a
lookout
let
the
others
lay
down
levere
fronted
me
what
all
this
about
he
asked
that
no
storm
cloud
yonder
there
is
always
danger
in
fog
i
answered
coldly
and
besides
there
is
no
use
carrying
on
until
we
know
where
we
are
bound
my
purpose
is
to
keep
the
men
busy
and
then
talk
the
situation
over
with
them
have
you
any
criticism
of
this
plan
senor
levere
he
hesitated
but
his
eyes
were
narrowed
and
ugly
you
do
as
you
please
but
you
told
me
we
sailed
for
porto
grande
was
that
a
lie
not
necessarily
and
i
smiled
grimly
although
i
should
not
have
hesitated
to
tell
one
under
the
circumstances
i
mean
to
leave
that
decision
to
the
men
themselves
it
is
their
lives
that
are
in
danger
that
damn
scum
half
of
them
are
english
and
french
all
they
want
is
to
get
away
they
will
never
go
back
to
porto
grande
without
you
make
them
how
make
them
by
false
observations
there
is
no
navigator
forward
it
is
a
trick
easy
enough
to
play
with
a
little
nerve
i
would
never
have
taken
part
in
this
mutiny
if
i
had
supposed
you
meant
to
play
into
the
hands
of
the
men
it
is
very
little
part
you
took
senor
levere
judging
from
what
i
saw
you
seemed
quite
content
to
stand
aft
here
and
look
on
however
you
are
in
it
just
as
deeply
as
i
am
and
are
going
to
play
the
game
out
with
me
to
the
end
do
you
understand
that
what
you
mean
senor
play
it
out
go
on
with
the
rest
of
us
take
your
chance
with
the
men
and
do
your
duty
i
am
captain
here
and
i
know
how
to
handle
insubordination
the
first
sign
of
treachery
on
your
part
will
send
you
below
with
those
others
i
do
trust
you
and
all
i
want
is
an
excuse
to
put
you
out
of
the
way
so
be
careful
what
you
do
i
turned
and
walked
away
from
him
toward
the
forward
rail
the
men
were
still
aloft
but
coming
in
from
off
the
yards
below
me
in
the
door
of
the
companion
stood
dorothy
her
eyes
peering
curiously
about
the
deserted
deck
she
glanced
up
and
saw
me
the
whole
expression
of
her
face
changing
may
i
come
up
there
she
asked
certainly
let
me
help
you
stand
here
beside
me
and
you
can
see
all
that
is
being
done
that
all
lads
breakfast
is
ready
lay
down
all
except
the
lookout
we
watched
while
they
streamed
down
the
ratlines
and
gathered
forward
of
the
galley
squatting
in
groups
on
the
deck
to
all
appearances
the
fellows
had
not
a
care
in
the
world
or
any
thought
of
the
stirring
scenes
just
passed
through
the
girl
hand
touched
my
sleeve
and
i
turned
and
looked
into
her
face
a
lot
i
said
pleasantly
real
sailormen
as
long
as
they
are
fed
and
housed
why
worry
about
tomorrow
i
put
this
job
up
to
them
presently
the
sailor
who
came
into
the
cabin
told
me
about
your
fight
with
the
negro
you
were
not
hurt
oh
i
did
not
escape
entirely
free
but
received
no
serious
injury
it
is
not
to
be
thought
about
now
with
all
the
work
ahead
the
ship
is
safely
in
your
hands
i
can
hardly
affirm
that
miss
dorothy
the
vessel
is
in
our
control
and
the
worst
of
the
gang
secured
below
i
have
confidence
in
the
loyalty
of
only
a
very
few
of
these
fellows
and
the
others
will
have
to
be
watched
day
and
night
as
long
as
we
remain
afloat
those
are
desperate
men
locked
below
and
are
bound
to
make
some
effort
to
free
themselves
if
there
is
any
treachery
on
deck
it
may
lead
to
their
release
you
were
talking
with
senor
levere
i
overheard
a
word
or
two
he
is
not
with
you
willingly
no
and
i
swept
the
deck
seeking
him
fearful
what
i
said
might
be
overheard
i
distrust
him
more
than
any
of
the
others
those
men
forward
are
seamen
and
will
abide
by
their
mates
moreover
they
are
accustomed
to
taking
orders
and
doing
what
they
are
told
i
believe
i
can
handle
them
with
what
help
i
have
but
the
mulatto
is
different
he
belongs
with
the
worst
element
on
board
and
only
joined
us
from
fear
of
being
killed
just
as
estada
was
he
has
no
heart
in
this
job
and
would
accept
any
chance
to
square
himself
with
those
below
i
have
trouble
with
him
before
we
are
done
but
prefer
to
catch
the
man
but
what
do
you
mean
to
do
next
she
asked
anxiously
there
can
not
be
a
moment
of
safety
with
those
horrible
creatures
aboard
true
yet
with
the
material
i
am
dealing
with
i
dare
not
venture
too
far
probably
in
that
bunch
forward
there
are
men
guilty
of
every
crime
in
the
calendar
as
depraved
as
any
we
have
below
they
have
joined
us
for
various
reasons
but
would
desert
and
become
ugly
in
an
instant
if
they
suspected
we
might
turn
them
over
to
the
authorities
there
is
only
one
safe
course
for
me
to
pursue
under
these
conditions
let
them
decide
by
vote
what
should
be
done
what
do
you
imagine
such
a
vote
will
show
that
the
vessel
be
beached
on
some
remote
coast
all
the
spoils
aboard
divided
and
then
the
crew
permitted
to
go
where
they
please
there
will
be
some
who
may
prefer
continuing
the
cruise
before
destroying
the
bark
but
i
believe
there
are
enough
fairly
honest
fellows
among
them
eager
to
escape
this
sort
of
life
to
control
but
the
wretches
below
surely
you
would
not
leave
them
to
drown
no
they
would
have
to
be
released
with
the
others
after
the
division
had
been
made
that
would
leave
us
at
their
mercy
yes
i
whispered
if
we
waited
until
that
time
i
do
not
propose
taking
any
such
chance
here
is
my
plan
and
it
seems
the
only
feasible
one
left
us
we
are
helpless
if
these
men
revolt
and
they
certainly
will
unless
given
their
own
way
i
have
no
doubt
but
what
their
decision
will
be
practically
as
i
have
outlined
very
well
i
will
acquiesce
in
it
cheerfully
enough
to
arouse
no
suspicion
i
am
the
only
navigator
on
board
the
only
one
with
any
knowledge
even
of
where
we
are
not
even
levere
could
check
up
on
me
the
night
the
vessel
is
to
be
beached
watkins
and
carter
with
one
or
two
they
select
will
get
off
in
a
small
boat
carefully
provisioned
and
thus
make
our
own
landing
we
not
worry
about
what
fate
awaits
the
others
her
eyes
sought
mine
anxiously
full
of
questioning
you
are
confident
of
being
able
to
accomplish
this
without
detection
yes
we
can
choose
the
right
moment
with
not
men
enough
on
deck
to
prevent
our
lowering
a
boat
and
a
dark
night
the
escape
will
not
prove
difficult
no
one
aboard
except
myself
will
know
where
we
are
have
you
considered
captain
sanchez
why
no
in
surprise
he
is
helpless
below
badly
wounded
not
so
badly
as
you
suppose
she
said
swiftly
he
is
able
to
be
up
and
about
his
stateroom
i
heard
him
moving
and
i
believe
the
steward
has
told
him
what
has
occurred
on
board
and
endeavored
to
bear
a
message
from
him
to
those
men
amidships
you
believe
this
what
did
you
do
i
held
my
pistol
to
his
head
and
locked
him
in
the
pantry
he
is
there
now
with
the
sailor
you
sent
on
guard
that
is
what
i
came
on
deck
to
tell
you
but
sanchez
you
saw
nothing
of
him
no
but
there
was
certainly
movement
in
his
room
after
the
man
gunsaules
came
out
i
went
over
to
the
door
and
listened
but
there
was
no
way
for
me
to
lock
him
in
surely
it
must
have
been
him
moving
as
he
was
alone
there
i
stood
silent
my
eyes
first
on
the
forward
deck
and
then
sweeping
about
the
horizon
the
view
by
then
was
very
narrow
the
gathering
clouds
of
mist
so
dense
as
to
obscure
everything
leaving
a
mere
gray
trail
of
sea
revealed
scarcely
a
hundred
yards
in
extent
in
any
direction
i
hardly
perceived
even
this
as
my
thought
centered
on
this
new
peril
yet
why
should
i
hold
it
a
peril
the
ending
of
it
was
in
my
hands
i
need
not
await
action
or
permit
him
opportunity
the
warning
had
come
in
ample
time
sanchez
was
still
in
my
power
separated
from
his
followers
incapable
of
doing
us
any
serious
harm
all
that
was
needed
for
me
to
do
was
to
keep
him
in
close
confinement
we
were
surely
not
far
from
the
coast
hours
perhaps
twelve
would
suffice
to
make
our
escape
from
this
cursed
ship
possible
i
must
get
an
observation
so
as
to
know
our
exact
position
after
that
the
course
would
be
figured
definitely
and
i
would
then
know
the
time
required
my
eyes
again
sought
her
face
he
is
a
danger
of
course
but
not
a
serious
one
i
said
confidently
it
is
safe
enough
to
leave
him
undisturbed
at
present
with
cole
on
guard
the
first
thing
i
need
do
is
to
satisfy
those
men
i
attend
to
that
now
and
then
see
to
the
proper
securing
of
sanchez
shall
i
remain
here
you
told
the
man
cole
what
you
heard
yes
i
explained
everything
to
him
before
i
came
on
deck
then
you
are
not
needed
in
the
cabin
he
is
a
reliable
man
remain
here
with
levere
while
i
go
forward
and
watch
that
he
does
not
attempt
to
go
below
the
fellows
had
not
finished
mess
but
i
felt
the
danger
of
further
delay
and
talked
to
them
as
they
sat
on
deck
explaining
briefly
the
entire
situation
and
the
causes
leading
up
to
the
mutiny
i
dealt
with
the
matter
in
plain
terms
making
no
apparent
effort
to
influence
them
yet
forcibly
compelling
each
individual
to
realize
what
would
be
the
result
of
our
recapture
they
listened
earnestly
asking
an
occasional
question
and
passing
comments
back
and
forth
freely
among
themselves
i
shall
never
forget
that
scene
the
decks
already
wet
with
fog
which
swirled
about
us
in
an
impenetrable
cloud
of
vapor
utterly
blotting
out
the
sea
and
even
rendering
our
faces
strange
and
indistinct
the
foremast
disappeared
at
the
lower
while
aft
of
the
galley
the
bark
was
entirely
invisible
we
rolled
heavily
in
the
swell
of
the
heaving
water
barely
retaining
the
closely
reefed
sails
aloft
flapping
against
the
masts
the
straining
deck
beams
creaking
noisily
to
every
roll
of
the
vessel
the
sailors
stared
up
at
me
rough
dressed
and
hairy
yet
not
a
lot
as
sailors
go
but
with
here
and
there
a
face
to
be
distrusted
i
sent
watkins
to
the
cabin
for
a
roll
of
charts
and
spreading
these
out
endeavored
as
well
as
i
could
to
make
clear
our
probable
position
and
the
nearest
point
of
land
this
was
largely
guesswork
but
i
approximated
distances
and
made
the
situation
fairly
clear
when
i
had
completed
the
explanation
and
stood
before
them
awaiting
decision
it
was
haines
who
acted
as
their
spokesman
this
yere
is
cape
howarth
he
asked
a
grimy
thumb
on
the
point
indicated
an
yer
say
it
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
west
yes
about
that
an
thar
no
settlement
some
colonists
fifty
miles
north
is
all
that
right
he
turned
to
the
others
say
mates
this
is
how
i
figure
we
ca
go
on
no
long
cruise
with
all
those
bloody
rats
in
the
hold
they
bound
ter
find
some
way
out
if
we
give
time
fer
as
concerned
i
fer
dividin
up
whut
we
got
and
ter
hell
with
piratin
what
yer
say
mates
shall
we
run
the
ol
hooker
ashore
an
leave
her
thar
while
we
tramp
the
coast
we
just
a
crew
what
them
fellers
down
below
ter
hell
with
let
take
keer
o
thet
the
way
they
treat
us
he
bloody
well
right
mates
said
a
loud
voice
heartily
plenty
o
swag
aboard
ter
give
us
all
a
fist
full
i
fer
a
division
an
gettin
out
with
our
lives
what
say
yer
there
was
a
chorus
of
approval
sufficient
in
volume
to
satisfy
me
and
i
accepted
this
as
a
decision
all
right
lads
i
said
briefly
in
my
judgment
your
choice
is
a
wise
one
i
have
an
observation
as
soon
as
the
fog
clears
and
head
in
for
the
cape
when
do
we
divide
the
swag
fifty
miles
off
the
coast
that
fair
enough
is
it
and
my
share
goes
to
you
there
was
a
straggling
cheer
but
i
broke
it
up
with
a
sharp
order
now
stand
by
for
work
all
of
you
watkins
and
carter
i
want
you
aft
chapter
xxiii
the
prisoners
escape
the
two
men
followed
me
silently
as
far
as
the
companion
where
we
paused
a
moment
staring
blindly
about
us
into
the
fog
even
the
guard
at
the
main
hatch
was
invisible
this
can
scarcely
last
long
i
remarked
but
there
may
be
a
storm
brewing
i
do
think
so
sir
one
of
the
men
answered
civilly
i
run
in
to
these
yere
mists
afore
this
coast
it
liable
ter
be
all
clear
the
sun
goes
down
well
we
make
the
ship
safe
first
carter
you
are
an
able
seaman
yes
sir
guard
this
after
deck
until
watkins
and
i
come
back
under
no
circumstances
permit
levere
to
enter
the
cabin
you
understand
he
grinned
appreciatively
that
nigger
ai
likely
ter
get
by
me
sir
i
just
like
for
ter
take
one
whack
at
him
do
be
rough
if
you
can
help
it
as
far
as
i
know
now
he
is
with
us
and
ranks
second
officer
my
only
orders
are
see
that
he
remains
on
deck
while
we
are
below
ay
ay
sir
he
stay
thar
with
the
door
closed
we
were
plunged
into
a
darkness
which
rendered
the
interior
invisible
i
wondered
dimly
why
the
man
on
guard
had
not
lighted
the
swinging
lantern
but
before
i
could
call
out
to
the
fellow
watkins
whispered
what
up
anything
wrong
in
here
not
that
i
know
of
but
the
young
lady
reported
sanchez
moving
about
in
his
stateroom
and
i
think
it
safer
to
see
to
him
at
once
it
blacker
than
hell
down
thar
yes
i
do
understand
it
wait
here
a
minute
until
i
strike
a
light
i
stumbled
over
something
on
the
deck
as
i
groped
forward
but
with
mind
centered
on
the
one
object
did
not
pause
until
i
had
located
the
lantern
it
blazed
up
brightly
enough
its
yellow
flame
illuminating
the
cabin
and
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
the
outstretched
figure
of
the
sailor
almost
between
my
feet
i
sprang
back
giving
utterance
to
a
cry
which
brought
watkins
to
me
and
the
two
of
us
stared
at
the
grewsome
object
and
then
about
into
the
wavering
shadows
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
the
dead
man
lying
on
his
face
motionless
blood
still
oozing
from
an
ugly
knife
wound
in
his
back
we
needed
to
ask
no
questions
imagine
nothing
the
overturned
chair
the
stricken
sailor
told
the
whole
story
he
had
been
treacherously
stuck
from
behind
the
blade
driven
home
by
a
strong
hand
and
was
dead
before
he
fell
to
the
deck
it
had
been
silent
vengeful
murder
and
the
assassin
had
left
no
trace
who
could
it
have
been
not
gunsaules
surely
the
steward
lacked
both
nerve
and
strength
for
such
a
deed
then
there
was
but
one
to
suspect
silva
sanchez
i
stood
there
dumb
gazing
at
the
dead
man
realizing
all
this
dimly
yet
conscious
only
of
thankfulness
that
the
victim
had
not
been
dorothy
fairfax
he
dead
sir
growled
watkins
turning
the
fellow
over
with
his
foot
until
the
ghastly
face
stared
up
at
the
deck
beams
overhead
stabbed
to
the
heart
frum
behind
look
a
yere
that
wus
sum
slash
who
the
hell
do
yer
suppose
did
it
that
is
ours
to
find
out
the
deed
has
just
been
done
for
blood
is
still
flowing
let
him
alone
watkins
and
come
with
me
the
murderer
ca
be
far
off
i
flung
open
the
pantry
door
but
one
glance
inside
told
me
that
gunsaules
had
vanished
on
the
deck
lay
the
strands
of
rope
with
which
he
had
been
secured
had
been
severed
by
a
sharp
knife
the
ends
discolored
with
blood
stains
i
held
these
out
to
watkins
cut
since
the
murder
i
said
harshly
and
by
the
same
knife
who
was
in
here
sir
the
steward
gunsaules
he
did
do
the
job
but
i
believe
i
know
who
did
we
try
the
port
stateroom
aft
stand
by
there
likely
to
be
two
of
them
the
door
was
unlocked
and
opened
noiselessly
but
i
took
no
chances
thinking
this
possibly
a
ruse
gloomy
as
the
interior
appeared
in
the
weird
light
with
banks
of
fog
driving
against
the
ports
a
single
swift
glance
convinced
me
it
was
deserted
there
was
no
place
for
a
man
to
hide
yet
i
could
not
convince
myself
of
its
emptiness
until
i
peered
into
the
disarranged
bunk
and
surveyed
every
shadowed
corner
watkins
watched
me
curiously
turning
his
head
occasionally
to
stare
out
into
the
lighted
cabin
behind
the
situation
baffled
me
completely
that
sanchez
had
done
the
deed
informed
by
the
steward
of
what
was
occurring
on
board
and
rendered
desperate
by
that
report
was
clear
enough
in
my
mind
but
what
had
become
of
the
man
he
could
not
have
escaped
overboard
as
the
ports
were
screwed
down
and
his
appearance
on
the
open
deck
above
would
have
surely
been
observed
his
place
of
concealment
must
remain
aft
in
the
cabin
and
if
so
he
must
be
discovered
by
immediate
search
i
ordered
watkins
to
take
the
lantern
from
the
rack
and
follow
me
from
stateroom
to
stateroom
we
began
with
dorothy
finding
none
of
them
locked
until
we
came
to
where
manuel
was
held
prisoner
all
were
empty
and
in
disorder
while
bending
my
ear
to
the
locked
door
i
could
distinguish
the
heavy
breathing
of
its
inmate
the
fellow
was
evidently
sound
asleep
what
do
you
make
of
it
tom
i
asked
facing
him
in
the
dim
halo
of
light
well
sir
scratching
his
head
with
his
disengaged
hand
thar
but
two
more
places
ter
look
the
cuss
is
either
in
the
lazaret
else
hidin
in
the
passage
forward
more
likely
the
last
why
not
the
lazaret
cause
thar
would
be
no
object
fer
him
to
go
thar
he
dud
get
out
agin
with
the
kiver
shut
down
the
thing
he
most
likely
try
fer
wud
be
ter
release
them
lads
amidships
that
give
him
a
gang
bullies
ter
fight
with
my
idea
is
sir
he
thought
he
have
time
ter
git
the
bulkhead
door
open
before
anybody
cum
below
he
an
the
steward
who
know
what
the
tools
wus
that
wus
the
scheme
only
we
busted
in
too
quick
that
whar
they
both
are
skulkin
back
in
them
shadows
he
fitted
the
smoking
lantern
back
onto
the
shelf
to
have
his
hands
free
for
action
and
drew
a
cutlass
out
of
the
arm
rack
running
one
leatherly
thumb
along
the
blade
to
test
its
sharpness
his
eyes
sought
mine
questioningly
probably
your
guess
is
the
right
one
i
said
soberly
we
give
it
a
trial
and
should
need
no
help
to
handle
the
two
of
them
the
deck
under
our
feet
was
fairly
steady
the
vessel
having
barely
rolling
slightly
to
the
heave
of
the
sea
no
sound
readied
us
from
above
and
the
silence
of
the
cabin
was
profound
indeed
the
stillness
irritated
me
with
its
mystery
rendered
me
reckless
to
penetrate
its
meaning
murder
had
been
committed
for
a
purpose
it
was
the
first
step
in
an
effort
to
retake
the
ship
if
we
were
to
retain
our
advantage
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
we
were
pitted
now
against
silva
sanchez
and
he
was
a
leader
not
to
be
despised
or
temporized
with
no
cowardly
brainless
fool
the
passage
leading
forward
was
wide
enough
to
permit
of
our
advancing
together
and
for
a
few
steps
the
light
dribbled
in
past
us
quite
sufficient
for
guidance
although
our
shadows
were
somewhat
confusing
there
were
closed
doors
on
either
side
evidently
locked
as
they
refused
to
yield
to
the
hand
i
took
these
to
be
storerooms
possibly
containing
spoils
of
the
voyage
but
gave
them
little
other
thought
my
whole
interest
centered
on
the
intense
blackness
ahead
i
had
been
down
this
tunnel
once
before
and
knew
the
bulkhead
was
not
far
away
but
the
few
steps
necessary
plunged
us
into
profound
blackness
through
which
we
advanced
cautiously
with
outstretched
hands
no
slightest
sound
warned
of
danger
and
i
was
already
convinced
in
my
own
mind
that
the
refugees
were
not
hiding
there
when
it
happened
within
an
instant
we
were
fighting
for
our
lives
fronted
not
by
two
men
but
by
a
score
who
flung
themselves
cursing
upon
us
their
very
numbers
and
the
narrowness
of
the
passage
was
our
only
salvation
at
first
our
resistance
was
blind
enough
guided
only
by
the
senses
of
touch
and
sound
we
could
see
nothing
of
our
antagonists
although
their
fierce
rush
hurled
us
backward
i
fired
into
the
mass
as
watkins
slashed
madly
with
his
cutlass
both
managing
in
some
way
to
keep
our
feet
hands
gripped
for
us
a
bedlam
of
oaths
splitting
the
air
yet
even
in
that
moment
of
pandemonium
i
was
quick
to
realize
the
fellows
were
weaponless
seeking
only
to
reach
and
crush
us
with
bare
hands
the
same
discovery
must
have
come
to
the
mind
of
the
sailor
for
he
yelled
it
out
defiantly
every
stroke
of
his
blade
drawing
blood
i
joined
him
striking
with
the
butt
of
the
pistol
feeling
within
me
the
strength
of
ten
men
yet
the
very
weight
of
them
thrust
us
remorselessly
back
we
killed
and
wounded
the
curses
of
hate
changed
into
sharp
cries
of
agony
but
those
behind
pressed
the
advance
forward
and
we
were
inevitably
swept
back
into
the
light
of
the
cabin
lamp
then
i
saw
faces
hideous
in
the
glare
demonical
in
their
expression
of
hatred
a
mass
of
them
unrecognizable
largely
of
a
wild
type
with
here
and
there
a
bearded
white
nor
were
they
all
in
many
a
grip
flashed
a
knife
and
directly
fronting
me
with
a
meat
cleaver
uplifted
to
strike
sanchez
yelled
his
orders
ignoring
all
others
i
leaped
straight
at
him
crying
to
watkins
as
i
sprang
back
lad
dash
out
that
light
i
hold
these
devils
here
a
minute
i
did
knows
how
it
was
like
no
fighting
ever
i
had
done
before
a
mad
furious
mélée
amid
which
i
lost
all
consciousness
of
action
all
guidance
of
thought
struggling
as
a
wild
brute
with
all
the
reckless
strength
of
insanity
it
is
a
dim
vague
recollection
i
am
sure
i
felled
sanchez
with
one
blow
of
my
stretching
him
apparently
lifeless
at
my
feet
in
some
way
that
deadly
cleaver
came
into
my
hands
and
i
trod
on
his
body
swinging
the
sharp
blade
with
all
my
might
into
those
scowling
faces
they
gave
sullenly
backward
they
had
to
yelping
and
snarling
like
a
pack
of
wolves
hacking
at
me
with
their
short
knives
i
was
cut
again
and
again
but
scarcely
knew
it
i
stood
on
quivering
flesh
driving
my
weapon
from
right
to
left
crazed
with
blood
and
seeking
only
to
kill
i
saw
faces
crushed
in
arms
severed
men
reeling
before
me
in
terror
the
sudden
spurting
of
blood
from
ghastly
wounds
oaths
mingled
with
cries
of
agony
and
shouts
of
hate
then
in
an
instant
the
light
was
dashed
out
and
all
was
darkness
it
was
as
though
my
brain
snapped
back
into
ascendency
i
was
no
longer
a
raging
fury
mad
with
the
desire
to
kill
but
planning
escape
before
a
hand
could
reach
me
in
restraint
i
sprang
backward
and
ran
in
the
darkness
of
the
cabin
i
collided
with
the
table
and
fell
sprawling
over
a
stool
the
noise
guided
pursuit
yet
wedged
together
as
those
fellows
still
were
in
the
narrow
passage
fighting
each
other
in
the
black
gloom
gave
me
every
advantage
and
so
unhalted
i
stumbled
up
the
stairs
leading
to
the
companion
the
vague
glimmer
of
daylight
showing
through
the
glass
revealed
the
presence
of
watkins
i
heard
him
dash
the
door
wide
open
call
to
those
on
deck
and
then
saw
him
wheel
about
to
again
confront
the
devils
plunging
blindly
forward
toward
us
through
the
dark
cabin
we
could
hold
them
here
for
a
time
at
least
yet
i
had
the
sense
to
know
that
this
check
would
prove
only
temporary
they
outnumbered
us
ten
to
one
and
would
arm
themselves
from
the
rack
yet
the
greater
danger
lay
in
the
loyalty
of
my
own
men
a
dozen
of
us
might
hold
these
stairs
against
assault
but
treachery
would
leave
us
helpless
and
the
very
thickness
of
the
fog
without
invited
to
treachery
if
one
among
them
and
there
were
many
capable
of
such
an
act
should
steal
below
forward
and
force
open
the
door
from
the
forecastle
we
would
be
crushed
between
two
waves
of
men
and
left
utterly
helpless
i
saw
the
whole
situation
vividly
and
as
quickly
chose
the
only
course
to
pursue
the
one
hope
remaining
here
lads
i
called
sharply
back
over
my
shoulder

or
six

to
hold
back

scum

the
and
then
stand
by
send
me
word
the
moment
all
is
ready
that
all
going
to
be
busy
here
presently
i
had
glimpse
of
the
thick
fog
without
as
he
pushed
through
the
door
and
of
a
scarcely
distinguishable
group
of
men
on
the
deck
those
about
me
could
only
be
located
by
their
restless
movements
i
stepped
down
one
stair
conscious
of
increasing
movement
below
the
meat
cleaver
still
gripped
in
my
hands
any
of
you
armed
with
cutlasses
oui

a
gruff
voice
has
they
busted
out
from
between
decks
that
what
happened
the
cabin
is
full
of
and
it
is
your
life
and
mine
in
the
balance
if
we
can
get
away
in
this
fog
they
never
find
us
but
we
got
to
hold
them
here
until
the
boats
are
ready
is
it
sanchez
it
was
sanchez

i
killed

is
where
we

good

rack

days
ago

the
bandoliers
but
no
powder
i
wus
goin
ter
break
open
a
cask
but
estada
put
me
at
another
job
then
that
leaves
us
on
even
footing
lads
we
ought
to
be
equal
to
them
with
the
cold
steel
can
any
of
you
see
below
chapter
xxiv
in
clasp
of
the
sea
the
sound
of
voices
of
moving
bodies
and
bits
of
furniture
overturned
were
plainly
discernible
but
the
darkness
was
far
too
dense
below
to
permit
the
eye
perceiving
what
was
taking
place
yet
i
could
picture
the
scene
the
leaderless
mob
surging
blindly
forward
each
man
vocal
in
his
own
tongue
swaying
with
rage
many
smarting
with
wounds
uncertain
where
we
had
disappeared
yet
all
alike
crazed
with
a
desire
to
attain
the
open
deck
the
rattle
of
steel
the
curses
told
me
some
among
them
had
reached
the
arm
rack
and
seized
whatever
weapons
they
found
there
in
their
struggle
the
rack
was
overturned
and
suddenly
amid
the
din
a
shrill
penetrating
voice
yelled
something
in
spanish
which
seemed
to
hush
the
clamor
there
followed
a
shuffling
of
feet
and
the
crash
of
wood
as
though
the
butt
of
a
gun
had
splintered
a
door
panel
then
the
same
voice
again
pierced
the
babel
my
mind
gripped
the
meaning
of
it
all
they
had
found
a
leader
they
had
released
manuel
estevan
now
the
real
fight
was
on
we
stooped
low
to
escape
as
much
as
possible
from
the
dim
revealing
light
streaming
through
the
glass
at
our
backs
and
waited
staring
into
the
black
depths
of
the
cabin
and
listening
for
every
sound
the
release
of
manuel
the
very
knowledge
of
his
presence
had
changed
the
mob
into
dangerous
fighters
the
roar
of
voices
died
away
with
the
noise
of
confusion
i
could
hear
the
fellow
question
those
about
him
seeking
to
learn
the
situation
but
the
delay
was
short
and
no
inkling
of
his
quickly
conceived
plan
of
attack
was
revealed
yet
he
saw
us
and
understood
his
eyes
long
trained
to
darkness
must
have
already
marked
our
dim
outlines
for
his
first
order
evidenced
his
purpose
who
have
cutlasses
so
many
a
dozen
form
with
me
now
bullies
they
are
on
the
stairs
there
and
that
is
the
only
way
to
the
deck
show
those
damned
traitors
what
fighting
means
now
then
hell
with
we
met
them
point
to
point
our
advantage
the
narrow
staircase
and
the
higher
position
theirs
the
faint
glimmer
of
light
at
our
backs
the
first
rush
was
reckless
and
deadly
the
infuriated
devils
not
yet
realizing
what
they
faced
but
counting
on
force
of
numbers
to
crush
our
defense
manuel
led
them
yelling
encouragement
and
sweeping
his
cutlass
gripped
with
both
hands
in
desperate
effort
to
break
through
delasser
caught
its
point
with
his
blade
while
my
cleaver
missing
him
with
its
sharp
edge
nevertheless
dealt
the
fellow
a
blow
which
hurled
him
back
into
the
arms
of
the
man
behind
i
saw
nothing
else
in
detail
the
faint
light
barely
revealing
indistinct
figures
and
gleam
of
steel
it
was
a
pandemonium
of
blows
and
yells
strange
faces
appearing
and
disappearing
as
men
leaped
desperately
at
us
up
the
steps
and
we
beat
them
remorselessly
back
i
saw
nothing
more
of
manuel
in
the
fray
but
his
shrill
voice
urged
on
his
followers
it
was
strike
and
parry
cut
and
thrust
twice
i
kicked
my
legs
free
from
hands
that
gripped
me
and
delasser
fell
a
pike
thrust
through
him
who
took
his
place
i
never
knew
but
a
stout
fighter
the
lad
was
wielding
his
cutlass
viciously
so
that
we
held
them
with
dead
men
littering
every
step
to
the
cabin
deck
but
they
were
of
a
breed
trained
to
such
fighting
and
the
lash
of
manuel
tongue
drove
them
into
mad
recklessness
and
there
seemed
no
end
of
them
sweeping
up
out
of
those
black
shadows
with
bearded
or
lean
brown
savage
faces
charging
over
the
dead
bodies
hacking
and
gouging
in
vain
effort
to
break
through
i
struck
until
my
arms
ached
until
my
head
reeled
scarcely
conscious
of
physical
action
yet
aware
of
manners
shouts
now
you
now
once
more
and
you
have
them
santa
maria
you
got
to
go
through
bullies
is
no
other
way
to
the
deck
think
of
the
yellow
boys
below
they
are
all
yours
if
you
strike
hard
enough
rush
that
the
way
here
you
go
in
outside
the
rail
broth
of
hell
now
you
have
him
pedro
for
an
instant
i
believed
it
true
i
saw
jim
carter
seized
and
hurled
sideways
his
cutlass
clashing
as
it
fell
while
a
dozen
hands
dragged
him
headlong
into
the
ruck
beneath
but
it
was
only
an
instant
before
the
charging
devils
could
pass
me
a
huge
figure
filled
the
vacant
space
and
the
butt
of
a
gun
crashed
into
the
mass
it
was
the
dutchman
schmitt
fighting
like
a
demon
his
strength
that
of
an
ox
they
gave
way
in
terror
before
him
and
we
went
down
battering
our
way
until
the
stairs
were
clear
to
the
deck
except
for
the
dead
under
foot
when
we
stopped
not
a
fighting
man
was
left
within
the
sweep
of
our
arms
they
had
scurried
back
into
the
darkness
like
so
many
rats
and
we
could
only
stare
about
blindly
cursing
them
as
we
endeavored
to
recover
breath
schmitt
roared
like
a
wild
bull
and
would
have
rushed
on
but
for
my
grip
on
his
shirt
get
back
men
i
ordered
sharply
there
may
be
fifty
of
them
yonder
our
only
chance
is
the
stairs
do
as
i
say
schmitt
or
fight
me
back
now
we
flung
the
bodies
on
one
side
and
formed
again
from
rail
to
rail
below
us
there
was
noise
enough
a
babel
of
angry
voices
but
no
movement
of
assault
i
could
see
nothing
although
the
uproar
evidenced
a
large
number
of
men
jammed
together
in
that
blackness
beneath
what
they
would
do
next
was
answered
by
a
blaze
of
light
revealing
the
silhouette
of
a
man
engaged
in
touching
flame
to
a
torch
of
hemp
it
flung
forth
a
dull
yellow
glare
and
revealed
a
scene
of
unimaginable
horror
our
assailants
were
massed
half
way
back
so
blended
together
i
could
not
judge
their
number
many
between
us
and
the
light
with
faces
darkened
by
shadow
between
us
even
ten
feet
from
the
stairs
the
deck
was
littered
with
bodies
ghastly
faces
staring
up
with
black
stains
of
blood
everywhere
it
was
hand
which
had
kindled
the
light
and
the
first
croak
of
his
voice
told
his
purpose
now
you
sculking
cowards
he
yelled
pointing
forward
do
you
see
what
you
are
fighting
there
are
only
five
men
between
you
and
the
deck
to
hell
with
come
on
i
show
you
the
way
he
leaped
forward
but
it
was
his
last
step
with
one
swing
of
my
arm
i
sent
the
cleaver
hurtling
through
the
air
i
know
not
how
it
struck
him
but
he
went
down
his
last
word
a
shriek
his
arms
flung
out
in
vain
effort
to
ward
off
the
blow
schmitt
roared
out
a
dutch
oath
and
before
i
knew
fully
what
had
happened
his
gun
sent
whirling
above
me
had
crashed
into
the
uplifted
torch
again
it
was
black
hideous
night
through
which
the
eye
could
perceive
nothing
even
the
noise
ceased
but
a
hand
gripped
my
shoulder
who
are
you
nigger
sam
sah
mistah
watkins
sez
it
all
done
fixed
where
is
he
here
answered
watkins
himself
in
a
hoarse
whisper
the
boats
are
ready
afloat
yes
sir
the
one
forward
has
pushed
off
loaded
the
is
alongside
there
is
such
a
hell
of
a
fog
sir
yer
ca
see
two
fathoms
from
the
ship
all
the
better
for
us
is
the
girl
in
the
boat
safe
sir
but
levere
ai
what
do
you
mean
that
he
has
got
away
i
ordered
you
to
have
harwood
watch
him
yes
sir
but
the
mate
slipped
out
o
sight
in
the
fog
he
somewhar
aboard
but
we
ai
been
able
ter
put
hands
on
him
nowhar
yet
never
mind
him
the
fellow
can
do
no
harm
now
move
back
slowly
lads
schmitt
and
i
will
be
the
last
ones
out
pick
up
that
cutlass
schmitt
we
must
act
before
those
devils
down
there
wake
up
again
we
closed
the
companion
door
as
silently
as
possible
and
for
the
moment
there
was
no
sound
from
within
to
show
that
our
cautious
withdrawal
had
been
observed
i
stared
about
but
was
able
to
perceive
little
beyond
the
small
group
awaiting
my
orders
the
fog
clung
thick
and
heavy
on
all
sides
the
lungs
breathed
it
in
and
the
deck
underfoot
was
as
wet
as
though
from
heavy
rain
moisture
dripped
from
yards
and
canvas
and
it
was
impossible
for
the
eye
to
penetrate
to
either
rail
fortunately
there
was
no
weight
of
sea
running
and
the
bark
swung
gently
still
retaining
but
with
not
wind
enough
aloft
to
flap
the
sails
the
silence
and
gloom
was
most
depressing
is
there
a
hand
at
the
wheel
watkins
no
sir
it
lashed
and
the
there
sir
below
the
then
there
is
nothing
more
to
keep
us
aboard
lads
stow
yourselves
away
and
hang
on
i
wait
here
until
you
are
all
over
they
faded
away
into
the
mist
dim
spectral
figures
and
i
remained
alone
listening
anxiously
for
some
hostile
sound
from
below
had
i
chosen
the
right
course
i
was
not
altogether
sure
yet
we
had
gone
too
far
now
to
decide
on
any
other
perhaps
if
i
had
called
on
those
men
up
on
deck
who
had
loaded
guns
we
might
have
forced
the
escaped
prisoners
back
into
their
place
of
confinement
and
thus
kept
control
of
the
vessel
yet
at
that
it
would
only
mean
a
few
hours
more
on
board
amid
constant
danger
of
revolt
it
might
have
enabled
us
to
salvage
the
gold
hidden
below
but
i
was
not
greatly
concerned
for
this
as
my
one
and
only
purpose
was
the
preservation
of
dorothy
the
men
might
prove
ugly
when
they
awoke
to
the
loss
but
i
had
little
fear
of
them
once
we
were
at
sea
in
the
small
boats
and
their
lives
depended
on
my
seamanship
unless
a
storm
arose
our
lives
were
in
no
great
peril
although
i
would
have
preferred
being
closer
to
the
coast
before
casting
adrift
i
wondered
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
that
silence
below
true
the
fellows
were
leaderless
and
defeated
yet
they
were
desperate
spirits
and
fully
aware
that
they
must
attain
the
open
deck
in
order
to
recapture
the
vessel
they
would
not
remain
quiet
long
and
once
discovering
our
retirement
would
swarm
up
the
stairs
animated
with
fresh
courage
satisfied
that
the
lads
were
safely
over
the
rail
and
the
decks
clear
i
turned
toward
the
ship
side
as
i
did
so
a
yell
reached
my
ears
from
the
blackness
below
the
hounds
had
found
voice
i
ran
through
the
fog
in
the
direction
the
others
had
disappeared
and
had
taken
scarcely
three
steps
when
i
collided
against
the
form
of
a
man
whose
presence
was
not
even
noticed
until
we
came
together
yet
he
must
have
been
there
expectant
and
ready
for
a
quick
knife
thrust
slashed
the
front
of
my
jacket
bringing
a
spurt
of
blood
as
the
blade
was
jerked
back
it
was
a
blow
at
the
heart
missing
its
mark
only
because
of
my
outstretched
arms
and
the
rapidity
of
my
advance
even
as
my
fingers
gripped
the
uplifted
wrist
he
could
strike
the
second
time
i
knew
my
antagonist
i
knew
also
this
was
a
fight
to
the
death
a
sharp
remorseless
struggle
to
be
terminated
before
that
unguarded
crew
below
could
attain
the
deck
it
was
levere
life
or
mine
and
in
the
balance
the
fate
of
those
others
in
the
waiting
boat
alongside
the
knowledge
gave
me
the
strength
and
ferocity
of
a
tiger
all
the
hate
and
distrust
i
felt
for
the
man
came
uppermost
in
that
moment
of
rage
i
did
not
so
much
care
what
happened
to
me
if
i
was
only
privileged
to
kill
him
i
ripped
the
knife
from
his
fingers
and
we
closed
with
bare
hands
our
muscles
cracking
to
the
strain
his
voice
uttering
one
croaking
cry
for
help
as
i
bore
in
on
his
windpipe
he
was
a
snake
a
cat
slipping
out
of
my
grip
as
by
some
magic
turning
and
twisting
like
an
eel
yet
unable
to
wholly
escape
or
overcome
my
strength
and
skill
at
last
i
had
him
prone
against
the
rail
the
weight
of
us
both
so
hard
upon
it
the
stout
wood
cracked
and
we
both
went
over
grappling
together
until
we
splashed
into
the
water
below
the
shock
the
frantic
effort
to
save
myself
must
have
loosened
my
hold
for
as
i
fought
a
way
back
to
the
surface
i
was
alone
lost
in
the
veil
of
mist
blinded
by
fog
the
water
dripping
from
my
hair
weakened
by
struggle
and
loss
of
blood
my
mad
rage
against
levere
for
the
moment
obscured
all
else
in
my
mind
what
had
become
of
the
fellow
had
he
gone
down
like
a
stone
or
was
he
somewhere
behind
this
curtain
of
fog
a
splash
to
the
right
led
me
to
take
a
dozen
strokes
hastily
but
to
no
purpose
the
sound
was
not
repeated
and
i
no
longer
retained
any
sense
of
direction
to
guide
me
the
sea
was
a
steady
swell
lifting
my
body
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
to
submerge
it
an
instant
later
in
the
deep
hollow
i
could
feel
the
motion
but
scarcely
perceived
it
otherwise
as
the
thick
gray
mist
obscured
everything
three
feet
away
it
deadened
and
confused
sound
also
again
and
again
i
felt
i
located
the
near
presence
of
the
the
sound
of
feet
on
deck
the
shout
of
a
voice
the
flapping
of
canvas
against
the
yards
but
as
i
desperately
turned
that
way
the
noise
ceased
or
else
apparently
changed
into
another
point
of
compass
once
a
cry
reached
me
thrilling
with
despair
although
i
could
not
catch
the
words
and
again
came
to
me
plainly
enough
the
clank
of
an
oar
in
its
rowlock
i
struck
out
madly
for
the
point
from
whence
it
came
only
to
find
the
same
rolling
water
and
obscuring
fog
my
strength
began
to
fail
hope
left
me
as
i
sank
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
remorseless
grip
of
the
sea
there
was
nothing
left
to
fight
for
to
struggle
after
the
fog
about
me
became
red
and
purple
before
my
straining
eyes
and
then
slowly
grew
black
my
muscles
refused
to
respond
to
my
will
i
no
longer
swam
but
floated
so
low
in
water
the
crest
of
the
waves
swept
over
my
face
i
no
longer
cared
gripped
by
a
strange
almost
delicious
languor
i
was
not
afraid
my
lips
uttered
no
cry
no
prayer
i
drifted
out
into
total
unconsciousness
and
went
down
chapter
xxv
the
open
boat
i
came
back
to
a
consciousness
of
pain
and
illness
unable
at
once
to
realize
where
i
was
or
feel
any
true
sense
of
personality
i
seemed
to
be
floating
through
the
air
aware
dimly
of
suffering
but
helplessly
in
the
grasp
of
some
power
beyond
all
struggling
against
then
slowly
i
comprehended
that
i
rested
in
a
boat
tossed
about
by
a
fairly
heavy
sea
that
it
was
night
and
there
were
stars
visible
in
the
sky
overhead
i
stared
at
these
vacant
of
thought
wondering
at
their
gleam
when
a
figure
seemed
to
lean
over
me
and
i
caught
the
outline
of
a
face
gazing
eagerly
down
into
my
own
instantly
memory
came
back
in
a
flash
this
was
not
death
but
life
i
was
in
a
boat
with
her
i
could
not
move
my
hands
and
my
voice
was
but
a
hoarse
whisper
mistress
fairfax
dorothy
yes
yes
swiftly
it
is
all
right
but
you
must
lie
still
watkins
captain
carlyle
is
conscious
what
shall
i
do
he
must
have
been
behind
us
at
the
steering
oar
for
his
gruff
kindly
voice
sounded
very
close
yer
might
lift
him
up
miss
he
said
soberly
he
breathe
better
how
that
captain
much
easier
i
managed
to
breathe
i
guess
i
am
all
right
now
you
fished
me
out
sam
did
he
got
a
boat
hook
in
your
collar
we
cast
off
when
yer
went
overboard
and
cruised
about
in
the
fog
hunting
fer
yer
who
was
it
yer
was
fightin
with
sir
levere
that
what
i
told
the
lads
he
a
goner
i
reckon
i
never
saw
him
after
we
sank
are
all
the
men
here
all
but
those
in
the
forward
boat
sir
they
got
away
furst
an
we
ai
had
no
sight
ov
since
maybe
we
will
when
it
gets
daylight
who
had
charge
harwood
sir
he
the
best
man
o
ther
lot
an
a
good
sailor
i
give
him
a
compass
an
told
him
ter
steer
west
wus
thet
right
all
i
could
have
told
him
i
admitted
lifting
myself
on
one
elbow
to
look
about
i
have
had
an
observation
and
it
is
all
guesswork
i
know
the
american
coast
lies
in
that
direction
but
that
is
about
all
i
could
tell
if
it
be
a
hundred
or
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
away
so
the
fog
has
lifted
without
a
storm
yes
sir
but
left
an
ugly
sea
there
has
been
plenty
o
wind
somewhere
but
we
seem
to
be
out
of
it
must
a
bin
midnight
when
the
mist
lifted
is
it
as
late
as
that
i
must
have
been
in
bad
shape
when
you
pulled
me
in
we
thought
you
was
gone
sir
you
was
bleedin
some
too
but
only
from
flesh
wounds
the
young
lady
she
just
would
let
yer
die
she
worked
over
yer
for
two
or
three
hours
sir
afore
i
hed
any
hope
her
eyes
were
downcast
and
her
face
turned
away
but
i
reached
out
my
hand
and
clasped
her
fingers
they
remained
quietly
in
my
grasp
but
neither
of
us
spoke
the
boat
lay
before
me
a
black
shadow
under
the
stars
flung
up
on
the
crests
of
the
waves
and
darting
down
into
the
hollows
it
required
all
of
watkins
skill
to
keep
it
upright
the
flying
spray
constantly
dashing
against
our
faces
the
men
were
but
dimly
revealed
sitting
with
heads
lowered
beneath
the
slight
protection
afforded
by
the
lug
sail
although
one
was
upon
his
knees
throwing
out
the
water
which
dashed
in
over
the
front
rail
he
was
succeeding
so
poorly
i
called
to
another
to
help
him
and
the
two
fell
to
the
job
with
new
vigor
i
could
not
distinguish
the
faces
of
the
fellows
but
counted
nine
altogether
in
the
boat
and
felt
assured
the
huge
bulk
at
the
foot
of
the
mast
was
the
dutchman
schmitt
beyond
these
dim
outlines
there
was
nothing
for
the
eye
to
rest
upon
only
a
few
yards
of
black
sea
in
every
direction
rendered
visible
by
the
reflected
and
the
dull
glow
of
crested
waves
it
was
dismal
awe
inspiring
and
i
felt
that
i
must
speak
to
break
the
dreadful
silence
my
eyes
sought
the
averted
face
beside
me
and
for
a
moment
in
peculiar
hesitancy
observed
the
silhouette
of
cheek
and
form
she
rested
against
the
gunwale
her
eyes
on
the
dark
vista
of
sea
her
chin
cupped
in
her
hand
the
mystery
of
the
night
and
ocean
was
in
her
motionless
posture
only
as
her
hand
gently
pressed
mine
did
i
gain
courage
with
a
knowledge
that
she
recognized
and
welcomed
my
presence
watkins
says
i
owe
my
life
to
you
i
said
so
low
the
words
were
scarcely
audible
above
the
dash
of
water
alongside
it
will
make
that
life
more
valuable
than
ever
before
she
turned
her
head
and
i
felt
her
eyes
searching
the
dim
outline
of
my
face
questioningly
of
course
i
did
everything
i
knew
she
replied
why
should
i
not
you
are
here
captain
carlyle
for
my
sake
i
owe
you
service
and
must
i
be
content
merely
with
that
thought
i
urged
far
from
pleased
this
would
mean
that
your
only
interest
in
me
arises
from
gratitude
and
friendship
her
voice
as
confidential
as
my
own
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
doubt
that
surely
it
would
be
easier
for
me
to
understand
but
for
the
memory
of
what
i
am
a
bond
slave
you
mean
the
fact
that
you
were
sold
to
my
uncle
remains
a
barrier
between
us
to
my
mind
yes
i
hope
you
forget
but
i
can
not
if
i
return
to
virginia
it
is
to
servitude
for
a
term
of
years
i
am
exiled
from
my
own
country
by
law
and
thus
prevented
from
following
a
career
on
the
sea
i
belong
to
roger
fairfax
or
if
he
be
dead
to
his
heirs
and
even
this
privilege
of
being
the
property
of
a
gentleman
is
mine
through
your
intercession
i
know
your
sympathy
your
eagerness
to
help
but
that
is
not
all
of
friendship
your
meaning
is
that
true
friendship
has
as
a
basis
equality
does
it
not
can
real
friendship
exist
otherwise
no
she
acknowledged
gravely
and
the
fact
that
such
friendship
does
exist
between
us
evidences
my
faith
in
you
i
have
never
felt
this
social
distinction
captain
carlyle
have
given
it
no
thought
this
may
seem
strange
to
you
yet
is
most
natural
you
bear
an
honorable
name
and
belong
to
a
family
of
gentlemen
you
held
a
position
of
command
won
by
your
own
efforts
you
bore
the
part
of
a
man
in
a
revolution
if
guilty
of
any
crime
it
was
a
political
one
in
no
way
sullying
your
honor
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
you
were
falsely
accused
and
convicted
consequently
that
conviction
does
not
exist
between
us
you
are
not
my
uncle
servant
but
my
friend
you
understand
me
now
i
have
trained
myself
so
long
to
another
viewpoint
mistress
dorothy
i
admitted
still
speaking
doubtfully
although
impressed
by
her
earnestness
i
know
not
how
to
accept
this
statement
i
have
not
once
ventured
to
address
you
except
as
a
servant
i
know
that
and
have
regretted
it
she
interrupted
but
not
until
now
have
i
been
able
to
correct
your
impression
and
you
would
actually
have
me
speak
with
you
as
of
your
own
class
a
free
man
worthy
to
claim
your
friendship
in
life
yes
frankly
her
face
uplifted
why
should
it
be
otherwise
it
has
been
our
fortune
to
meet
under
strange
conditions
captain
carlyle
conditions
testing
us
and
revealing
the
very
depths
of
our
natures
concealment
and
disguise
is
no
longer
necessary
between
us
you
have
served
me
unselfishly
plunging
headlong
into
danger
for
my
sake
i
shudder
at
the
thought
of
where
i
would
be
now
but
for
your
effort
to
save
me
no
man
could
have
done
more
or
proved
himself
more
staunch
and
true
we
are
in
danger
yet
adrift
here
in
the
heart
of
this
desolate
sea
but
such
peril
is
nothing
compared
with
what
i
have
escaped
i
am
glad
sincerely
glad
i
have
prayed
god
in
thankfulness
i
feel
that
your
skill
and
courage
will
bring
us
safely
to
land
i
am
no
longer
afraid
for
i
have
learned
to
trust
you
in
all
ways
yes
as
gentleman
as
truly
as
sailor
you
possess
my
entire
confidence
cordial
and
earnest
as
these
words
were
they
failed
to
yield
me
sufficient
courage
to
voice
the
eager
impulse
of
my
heart
there
was
a
restraint
some
memory
of
the
past
perhaps
which
fettered
the
tongue
yet
i
struggled
to
give
my
desire
utterance
but
do
you
understand
fully
i
questioned
anxiously
all
i
have
done
for
you
would
have
been
done
for
any
other
woman
under
the
same
conditions
of
danger
i
claim
no
reward
for
that
a
plain
duty
i
am
sure
that
is
true
it
is
true
and
yet
different
such
service
to
another
would
have
been
a
duty
and
no
more
but
to
be
with
you
aiding
and
protecting
has
been
a
delight
a
joy
i
have
served
dorothy
fairfax
for
her
own
sake
not
as
i
would
any
other
did
you
not
suppose
i
knew
her
glance
flashed
into
mine
through
the
with
a
sudden
message
of
revealment
you
knew
that
that
it
was
you
personally
i
served
of
course
i
knew
a
woman
is
never
unaware
of
such
things
nor
is
there
reason
now
here
in
this
boat
with
you
as
my
only
protector
why
i
should
pretend
otherwise
neither
of
us
know
what
the
end
may
be
we
may
sink
in
these
waters
or
be
cast
ashore
on
a
desolate
coast
to
perish
miserably
and
it
is
no
moment
for
concealment
now
if
ever
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
i
know
you
care
for
me
and
have
cared
since
first
we
met
an
interest
no
less
fateful
has
led
me
to
seek
your
acquaintance
and
give
you
my
aid
surely
it
is
not
unmaidenly
for
me
to
confess
this
when
we
face
the
chance
of
death
together
but
i
stammered
i
can
scarcely
believe
you
realize
your
words
i
i
love
you
dorothy
and
is
it
not
also
possible
for
me
to
love
possible
yes
but
why
should
you
forgive
me
but
i
can
not
drive
away
memory
of
the
gulf
between
us
i
would
not
dare
speak
such
words
of
my
own
volition
they
seem
almost
insult
you
are
rich
with
position
and
friends
of
influence
while
i
at
best
am
but
a
merchant
skipper
in
truth
a
bond
servant
penniless
and
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
i
am
not
fit
to
touch
the
hem
of
your
garment
is
it
the
eyes
of
the
world
or
my
eyes
into
which
you
look
yours
i
am
selfish
enough
i
fear
to
find
my
happiness
there
but
it
is
not
right
not
just
can
you
not
permit
me
to
be
the
judge
as
to
that
she
asked
seriously
i
know
your
story
and
have
seen
you
in
stress
and
storm
am
i
one
think
you
to
love
any
man
for
wealth
or
position
if
i
possess
these
things
they
are
to
share
not
to
hoard
it
is
because
i
have
given
you
my
full
trust
and
confidence
i
can
say
these
words
you
you
mean
you
love
me
her
eyes
fell
from
my
face
and
her
head
was
turned
away
but
there
was
no
falter
in
her
voice
i
love
you
are
you
sorry
sorry
i
am
mad
with
the
joy
of
it
yet
stricken
dumb
dorothy
dorothy
fairfax
i
have
never
even
dared
dream
of
such
a
message
from
your
lips
dear
dear
girl
do
you
forget
who
i
am
what
my
future
must
be
i
forget
nothing
she
said
almost
proudly
it
is
because
i
know
what
you
are
that
my
heart
responds
nor
is
your
future
so
clouded
you
are
today
a
free
man
if
we
escape
these
perils
for
whether
roger
fairfax
be
alive
or
dead
he
will
never
seek
you
again
to
hold
in
servitude
if
alive
he
will
join
his
efforts
with
mine
to
obtain
a
pardon
because
of
these
services
and
we
have
influence
in
england
yet
should
such
effort
fail
you
are
a
sailor
and
the
seas
of
the
world
are
free
it
is
not
necessary
that
your
vessel
fly
the
english
flag
you
give
me
hope
a
wonderful
hope
and
courage
her
hands
firmly
clasping
mine
courage
to
fight
on
in
faith
i
would
have
that
my
gift
to
you
geoffry
we
are
in
peril
still
great
peril
but
you
will
face
it
beside
me
knowing
that
whether
we
live
or
die
we
are
together
i
am
not
afraid
anymore
she
was
like
a
child
i
could
feel
her
body
relax
in
my
arms
as
though
relieved
of
its
tension
i
know
i
answered
her
whispering
into
her
ear
words
of
love
and
confidence
scarcely
knowing
myself
what
i
said
in
that
moment
of
unrestraint
i
felt
her
eyes
on
my
face
and
knew
her
lips
were
parted
in
a
smile
of
content
yet
doubt
if
they
answered
me
she
seemed
to
yield
unconsciously
her
head
upon
my
shoulder
her
face
upturned
to
the
stars
while
slowly
all
the
intense
fatigue
of
the
day
and
night
stupified
mind
and
body
almost
before
i
realized
her
weariness
the
eyes
were
closed
and
she
was
sleeping
in
my
arms
i
held
her
closely
so
awakened
by
what
had
passed
between
us
as
to
feel
no
desire
to
sleep
myself
dorothy
fairfax
loved
me
i
could
scarcely
grasp
the
thought
i
had
dreamed
of
love
but
only
to
repress
the
imagination
as
impossible
yet
now
voluntarily
from
her
own
lips
it
had
proven
true
with
eyes
uplifted
to
the
stars
i
swore
fidelity
pledging
solemnly
all
my
years
to
her
service
nor
could
i
drive
my
thought
away
from
the
dear
girl
sleeping
so
confidently
upon
my
shoulder
then
slowly
there
came
back
memory
of
where
we
were
of
what
grave
peril
surrounded
us
of
my
own
responsibility
my
eyes
sought
to
pierce
the
gloom
of
the
night
only
to
gain
glimpses
of
black
water
heaving
and
tumbling
on
every
side
the
boat
flung
high
on
a
whitened
crest
and
then
hurled
into
the
hollow
beneath
as
though
it
was
a
mere
chip
in
the
grasp
of
the
sea
the
skill
of
watkins
alone
kept
us
afloat
and
even
his
iron
muscles
must
be
strained
to
the
limit
forward
the
boat
was
a
mere
smudge
the
men
curled
up
asleep
and
no
longer
visible
all
that
stood
out
with
any
distinctness
of
outline
was
the
lug
sail
stiff
as
a
board
i
endeavored
to
turn
my
head
without
disturbing
the
slumbering
girl
to
gain
view
of
the
steersman
how
is
she
making
it
watkins
a
little
stiff
sir
but
she
a
staunch
boat
the
sea
likely
to
go
down
after
sunup
well
you
had
long
enough
trick
call
one
of
the
men
aft
i
not
strong
enough
yet
for
that
job
no
sir
and
i
caught
the
echo
of
a
chuckle
and
yer
have
yer
arms
full
i
kin
hold
on
yere
till
daylight
be
long
now
make
one
of
them
help
who
is
the
best
man
schmitt
for
this
sorter
job
i
called
him
and
growling
to
himself
at
being
awakened
the
dutchman
crept
past
cautiously
and
wedged
himself
in
beside
watkins
there
was
a
few
words
of
controversy
between
the
two
men
but
in
the
end
schmitt
held
the
steering
oar
and
a
few
minutes
later
watkins
had
slipped
down
into
the
boat
bottom
and
was
sound
asleep
and
so
the
gray
dawn
found
us
chapter
xxvi
a
floating
coffin
the
laboring
boat
rested
so
low
in
the
water
it
was
only
as
we
were
thrown
upward
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
that
i
could
gain
any
view
about
through
the
pallid
light
of
the
dawn
at
such
brief
instants
my
eyes
swept
the
far
horizon
to
discern
nothing
except
the
desolate
endless
expanse
of
sea
a
more
dismal
gloomy
view
surely
never
unrolled
itself
before
the
eye
of
man
everywhere
the
gray
monotony
of
rolling
waves
slowly
stretching
out
into
greater
distance
as
the
light
strengthened
yet
bringing
into
view
no
other
object
it
was
all
a
desolate
restless
waste
in
the
midst
of
which
we
tossed
while
above
hung
masses
of
dark
clouds
obscuring
the
sky
we
were
but
a
hurtling
speck
between
the
gray
above
and
the
gray
below
how
tiny
the
boat
looked
as
my
glance
ranged
forward
with
this
memory
of
our
surroundings
still
fresh
in
mind
the
crest
of
the
surges
swept
to
the
edge
of
the
gunwale
sending
the
spray
flying
inboard
occasionally
drops
stung
my
cheek
and
all
the
thwarts
forward
were
wet
with
drizzle
the
negro
sam
alone
was
awake
baling
steadily
his
face
turned
aft
although
scarcely
glancing
up
from
his
labor
he
looked
tired
and
worn
a
strange
green
tinge
to
his
black
face
as
the
dim
light
struck
it
the
others
were
curled
up
in
the
bottom
of
the
craft
soaked
with
spray
yet
sleeping
soundly
the
wind
had
lost
its
steadiness
coming
now
in
gusts
that
flapped
the
sail
loudly
against
the
mast
but
failed
to
awaken
the
slumberers
depressed
by
the
sight
my
eyes
sought
the
face
of
the
girl
whose
head
yet
rested
against
my
shoulder
she
lay
there
with
tightly
closed
eyes
the
long
lashes
outlined
against
her
cheek
breathing
softly
between
lips
slightly
parted
her
white
teeth
gleamed
as
she
smiled
from
pleasant
dreams
it
was
a
beautiful
face
into
which
i
looked
the
cheeks
faintly
tinted
the
chin
firm
the
rounded
throat
white
as
snow
the
face
of
a
pure
true
woman
yet
retaining
its
appearance
of
girlish
freshness
whatever
of
hardship
and
sorrow
the
past
days
had
brought
her
had
been
erased
by
sleep
and
she
lay
then
utterly
forgetful
of
danger
and
distress
and
she
loved
me
loved
in
spite
of
all
dividing
us
and
in
her
rare
courage
had
told
me
so
the
memory
thrilled
my
blood
and
i
felt
my
arm
close
more
tightly
about
her
as
i
gazed
eagerly
down
into
the
unconscious
features
she
was
actually
mine
mine
not
even
death
could
rob
me
of
the
treasure
of
her
heart
while
life
offered
me
every
reward
no
doubt
assailed
me
i
believed
each
whispered
word
from
her
lips
and
the
day
dawned
about
us
with
rare
hope
not
now
would
i
yield
to
despair
or
question
the
future
some
sudden
plunge
of
the
boat
caused
the
girl
to
open
her
eyes
and
gaze
half
frightened
up
into
my
face
then
she
smiled
in
swift
recognition
is
it
you
geoffry
we
are
still
alone
at
sea
yes
the
night
is
ending
you
have
slept
well
she
drew
herself
away
from
me
gently
sat
up
and
glanced
about
how
tired
you
must
be
i
have
been
very
selfish
there
is
nothing
in
sight
nothing
and
the
men
are
still
asleep
who
are
they
i
named
them
as
best
i
could
pointing
out
each
in
turn
are
they
reliable
safe
she
asked
you
know
them
not
well
but
they
were
selected
by
watkins
as
among
the
best
on
board
the
no
doubt
they
will
behave
themselves
but
they
are
pirates
they
can
not
be
trusted
these
fellows
were
not
aboard
the
from
choice
but
seamen
captured
on
merchant
ships
and
compelled
to
serve
to
preserve
their
lives
they
are
as
eager
to
escape
as
we
anyway
i
shall
see
to
it
that
they
do
their
duty
sam
the
negro
looked
up
quickly
yas
sah
call
the
others
who
knows
where
the
food
is
stored
watkins
spoke
up
behind
us
it
stored
forward
sir
an
all
safe
the
water
casks
are
lashed
amidships
i
see
what
we
got
and
serve
out
i
crept
forward
cautiously
because
of
the
erratic
leaping
of
the
craft
the
men
yielding
me
room
to
pass
and
soon
had
sam
busily
engaged
in
passing
out
the
various
articles
for
inspection
only
essentials
had
been
chosen
yet
the
supply
seemed
ample
for
the
distance
i
believed
we
would
have
to
cover
before
attaining
land
but
the
nature
of
that
unknown
coast
was
so
doubtful
i
determined
to
deal
out
the
provisions
sparingly
saving
every
crumb
possible
the
men
grumbled
at
the
smallness
of
the
ration
yet
munched
away
contentedly
enough
once
convinced
that
we
all
shared
alike
watkins
relieved
the
dutchman
at
the
steering
oar
and
i
rejoined
dorothy
the
silence
was
finally
broken
by
one
of
the
men
forward
asking
a
question
could
you
tell
us
about
where
we
are
sir
only
as
a
guess
i
answered
frankly
my
eyes
traveling
over
the
sea
vista
but
will
do
the
best
i
can
i
have
had
no
observation
since
we
left
the
capes
but
estada
had
his
chart
pricked
up
to
the
time
he
was
killed
showing
the
course
of
the
we
were
then
about
a
hundred
miles
off
shore
and
the
same
distance
south
we
have
been
sailing
to
the
north
of
west
since
taking
to
the
boat
that
is
the
best
course
possible
with
this
wind
then
a
couple
days
should
bring
land
sir
ay
if
figures
are
correct
and
this
wind
holds
but
these
are
stormy
waters
and
we
go
by
dead
reckoning
that
near
enough
he
said
stubbornly
even
if
you
was
astray
fifty
miles
would
make
little
difference
there
land
to
west
of
us
and
plenty
ter
eat
aboard
till
we
get
there
so
why
not
eat
it
i
glanced
about
into
the
faces
of
the
others
forward
but
received
little
encouragement
evidently
the
fellow
was
spokesman
for
his
mates
the
time
had
arrived
for
me
to
exhibit
my
authority
but
before
i
could
choose
words
watkins
gave
indignant
utterance
to
a
reply
yer
hed
yer
fair
share
with
the
rest
ov
us
did
yer
simms
course
i
did
but
damn
it
i
hungrier
then
i
wus
afore
whut
the
hell
the
use
let
me
tell
you
i
broke
in
determined
on
my
course
it
is
not
just
the
boat
trip
to
be
considered
although
that
may
prove
serious
enough
before
we
get
ashore
if
i
am
any
judge
we
are
going
to
have
some
weather
in
the
next
hours
and
may
have
to
run
before
it
to
keep
afloat
that
one
point
to
think
over
another
is
that
coast
line
west
of
us
does
contain
a
dozen
white
settlements
between
the
capes
and
florida
and
you
are
just
as
liable
to
be
hungry
on
land
as
sea
you
eaten
as
much
as
i
have
maybe
i
have
but
by
god
there
is
food
enough
there
to
last
us
a
month
and
it
may
have
to
do
so
now
simms
listen
to
what
i
say
and
you
others
also
i
am
not
going
to
repeat
this
we
the
same
as
men
and
i
am
in
command
of
this
boat
whatever
i
say
goes
and
i
handled
worse
fellows
than
you
are
many
a
time
grumble
all
you
please
i
do
mind
that
but
if
you
try
mutiny
or
fail
to
jump
at
my
orders
i
show
you
some
sea
discipline
you
will
not
forget
very
soon
you
are
with
me
watkins
you
bet
i
am
sir
heartily
the
dutchman
already
half
asleep
lifted
his
head
mine
gott
i
cud
eat
a
whale
he
growled
rather
discontentedly
but
what
der
difference
say
i
do
dat
wus
best
ach
simms
made
no
answer
sitting
sullenly
at
the
foot
of
the
mast
i
waited
thinking
some
other
might
venture
a
word
but
evidently
they
had
enough
and
i
was
willing
to
let
the
affair
rest
they
had
been
shown
that
i
meant
to
enforce
discipline
and
nothing
remained
but
for
me
to
carry
out
my
threat
if
occasion
arose
meanwhile
the
least
friction
aboard
the
better
all
right
lads
i
said
cheerfully
now
we
understand
each
other
and
can
get
at
work
we
divide
into
watches
first
of
all
two
men
aft
here
and
one
at
the
bow
watkins
and
i
will
take
it
watch
and
watch
but
there
is
enough
right
now
for
all
hands
to
turn
to
and
make
the
craft
shipshape
two
of
you
bail
out
that
water
till
she
dry
and
the
others
get
out
that
extra
sail
forward
and
rig
up
a
jib
she
ride
easier
and
make
better
progress
with
more
canvas
showing
how
does
she
head
watkins
by
west
sir
you
can
give
two
points
more
west
with
the
jib
drawing
the
sea
is
not
quite
so
heavy
ay
ay
sir
she
riding
fairly
free
an
the
wind
is
shifting
thar
wo
be
no
storm
terday
the
men
worked
cheerfully
enough
finding
sufficient
to
do
to
keep
them
busy
for
half
an
hour
and
thus
dorothy
and
i
watched
them
whispering
occasionally
to
each
other
and
commenting
on
the
varied
appearance
of
the
fellows
they
were
rather
an
interesting
lot
in
their
way
the
types
familiar
to
me
but
strange
to
her
experience
sea
scum
irresponsible
reckless
to
be
ruled
by
iron
hand
yet
honest
enough
according
to
their
standards
the
faces
were
coarse
and
dissipated
and
many
a
oath
floated
back
to
our
ears
but
i
saw
in
them
nothing
to
fear
or
cause
uneasiness
the
sun
had
dissipated
the
clouds
while
the
swell
of
the
sea
had
sufficiently
subsided
to
permit
of
a
wide
view
in
every
direction
the
vista
only
served
to
increase
our
sense
of
loneliness
and
peril
we
were
a
tiny
chip
tossed
on
the
immensity
of
the
waters
stretching
away
to
the
distant
horizons
it
was
a
vast
scene
of
desolation
without
another
object
to
break
its
grim
monotony
just
those
endless
surges
of
water
brightened
by
the
touch
of
the
sun
again
and
again
i
swept
my
eyes
about
the
circle
in
a
vain
effort
to
perceive
something
of
hope
it
was
useless
we
were
alone
on
the
boundless
ocean
i
know
not
what
we
talked
about
during
those
hours
of
all
we
had
passed
through
together
no
doubt
of
our
chances
of
escape
and
our
dreams
of
the
future
her
bravery
and
confidence
increased
my
own
courage
knowing
as
i
did
the
uncertainty
of
our
position
i
needed
her
blind
faith
to
keep
me
hopeful
the
men
gradually
knocked
off
work
and
lay
down
and
finally
i
also
yielded
to
her
pleadings
and
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
it
seemed
as
though
i
scarcely
lost
consciousness
yet
i
must
have
slept
for
an
hour
or
more
my
head
pillowed
on
her
lap
what
aroused
me
i
could
not
determine
but
schmitt
was
again
at
the
steering
paddle
and
both
he
and
dorothy
were
staring
across
me
out
over
the
port
quarter
as
though
at
some
vision
in
the
distance
sufficiently
strange
to
enchain
their
entire
attention
what
is
it
i
asked
eagerly
but
before
the
words
were
entirely
uttered
a
hoarse
voice
forward
bawled
out
excitedly
there
you
see
it
straight
out
agin
that
cloud
edge
by
god
it
a
schooner
ay
boomed
another
a
headin
straight
cross
our
course
astern
i
sat
up
ignoring
all
else
thoroughly
awake
from
excitement
gazing
under
hollowed
hands
in
the
direction
the
men
pointed
for
an
instant
i
distinguished
nothing
but
sea
and
sky
with
patches
of
white
cloud
speckling
the
horizon
my
heart
sank
with
the
belief
that
one
of
these
had
been
mistaken
for
the
sheen
of
a
distant
sail
then
as
our
boat
was
suddenly
flung
higher
on
the
crest
of
a
great
wave
my
straining
eyes
caught
the
unmistakable
glimmer
of
canvas
could
even
detect
its
outline
plainly
delineated
against
the
blue
background
i
reached
my
feet
clinging
to
the
mast
to
keep
erect
and
as
the
boat
was
again
flung
upward
gained
clearly
the
glimpse
i
sought
ay
you
right
lads
i
exclaimed
it
a
schooner
headed
to
clear
us
by
a
hundred
fathoms
port
your
helm
schmitt
hard
down
man
watch
out
the
boom
do
hit
you
miss
fairfax
now
sam
off
with
that
red
shirt
tie
it
on
the
boat
hook
and
let
fly
they
ca
help
seeing
us
if
there
is
any
watch
on
deck
we
swept
about
in
a
wide
circle
shipping
some
water
as
we
dipped
gunwale
under
but
came
safely
out
from
the
smother
headed
straight
across
the
bows
of
the
oncoming
vessel
all
eyes
stared
out
watchfully
sam
shirt
flapping
above
us
and
both
watkins
and
schmitt
straining
their
muscles
to
hold
the
plunging
against
the
force
of
the
wind
a
man
forward
on
his
knees
growled
out
a
curse
what
the
hell
the
matter
aboard
there
he
yelled
did
yer
ever
see
a
boat
yaw
like
that
afore
damn
me
if
i
believe
they
got
a
hand
at
the
wheel
the
same
thought
had
leaped
into
my
mind
the
schooner
was
headed
to
pass
us
on
the
port
quarter
yet
yawing
so
crazily
at
times
as
to
make
me
fearful
of
being
run
down
i
could
perceive
no
sign
of
life
aboard
no
signal
that
we
had
been
seen
indeed
from
where
we
crouched
in
the
boat
all
we
could
see
now
was
the
bow
with
the
jib
and
foresail
not
a
head
peered
at
us
over
the
rail
in
silent
mystery
it
seemed
to
fly
straight
at
us
like
a
great
bird
sweeping
through
water
and
sky
the
sight
angered
me
stand
by
all
hands
i
cried
desperately
we
board
whether
they
want
us
or
not
slip
across
miss
fairfax
out
of
the
way
now
watkins
run
us
in
under
those
easy
man
do
let
her
strike
us
lay
hold
quick
lads
and
hang
on
for
your
lives
give
me
that
end
of
rope
ready
now
all
of
you
i
make
the
leap
now
then
hold
hard
it
was
five
feet
and
up
my
purchase
the
tossing
boat
but
i
made
it
one
hand
desperately
gripping
a
shroud
until
i
gained
balance
and
was
flung
inboard
by
a
sharp
plunge
of
the
vessel
my
head
was
at
a
level
with
the
rail
yet
i
saw
nothing
my
whole
effort
being
to
make
fast
before
the
grip
of
the
men
should
be
torn
loose
this
done
i
glanced
back
into
the
upturned
faces
below
hand
in
slowly
lads
yes
let
go
the
rope
will
hold
and
the
boat
ride
safely
enough
let
a
couple
of
men
come
up
till
we
see
wrong
with
the
hooker
the
rest
of
you
trail
on
am

to
remain
here

carlyle
yes
for
a
few
moments
there
is
no
danger
you
stay
also
watkins
let
schmitt
and
sam
come
with
me
i
helped
them
clamber
up
and
then
lifted
my
body
onto
the
rail
from
which
position
i
had
a
clear
view
of
the
forward
deck
it
was
unexpressibly
dirty
yet
otherwise
shipshape
enough
ropes
coiled
and
the
forward
hatch
tightly
closed
nothing
human
greeted
me
and
conscious
of
a
strange
feeling
of
horror
i
slipped
over
onto
the
deck
the
next
moment
the
negro
and
dutchman
joined
me
the
former
staring
about
wildly
the
whites
of
his
eyes
revealing
his
terror
my
gawd
sah
he
ejaculated
ah
done

boat

shore
de

dat
galley
what

you
know

what
was

dis
minute
you
white
men

i
certainly
smell
something
unpleasant
enough
this
is
the
the
name
is
on
the
stern
of
that
boat
yonder
when
did
you
serve
aboard
here
three
years
back
sah
frum

african
coast
ah
want
no
more
dat
sorter
sailorin
but
what
could
have
happened
the
boats
are
all
in
place
but
no
crew
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
at
sea
schmitt
hand
fell
heavily
on
my
sleeve
and
i
glanced
aside
into
his
stolid
face
der
a
feller
on
ther
gratin
amidships
captain
he
said
pointing
aft
but
i
just
bet
i
know
vat
wus
der
trouble
what
man
cholera
he
whispered
ve
haf
boarded
a
death
ship
chapter
xxvii
on
board
the
slaver
the
terror
of
the
two
men
as
this
thought
dawned
upon
them
in
all
its
horror
was
apparent
enough
and
in
truth
i
shared
with
them
a
vivid
sense
of
our
desperate
situation
nothing
not
even
fire
was
more
to
be
dreaded
than
a
visitation
of
this
awful
nature
on
shipboard
i
had
heard
tales
to
chill
the
blood
of
whole
ships
crews
stricken
and
dying
like
flies
yet
i
dare
not
hesitate
or
permit
those
under
my
command
to
flee
in
terror
charnal
ship
though
this
might
be
the
danger
to
us
was
not
so
great
if
we
only
remained
in
the
open
air
and
used
proper
precaution
in
putting
the
dead
overboard
we
were
in
health
well
nourished
and
our
stay
aboard
would
be
a
short
one
even
if
the
schooner
was
a
floating
sepulcher
it
was
safer
by
far
than
the
cockleshell
towing
alongside
let
find
out
the
truth
first
men
i
said
quietly
stay
here
if
you
want
to
while
i
go
aft
only
hold
your
tongues
there
is
no
use
giving
up
until
we
know
what
the
danger
is
will
you
come
with
me
or
remain
where
you
are
the
two
exchanged
glances
and
then
their
eyes
ranged
along
the
unoccupied
deck
i
confess
it
was
eery
enough
the
silence
the
desolate
vista
the
sails
above
the
schooner
flying
through
the
water
as
though
guided
by
spectral
hands
and
that
single
motionless
figure
crouched
on
the
grating
amidships
it
made
my
own
nerves
throb
and
caused
me
to
clinch
my
teeth
sam
turned
his
head
his
frightened
eyes
seeking
the
scuttle
leading
into
the
forecastle
he
was
more
frightened
to
remain
where
he
was
than
accompany
me
but
when
he
endeavored
to
say
so
his
lips
refused
to
utter
any
sound
the
terror
in
his
eyes
caused
me
to
laugh
and
my
own
courage
came
back
with
a
rush
afraid
of
dead
men
are
you
then
we
face
them
together
my
lads
and
have
it
over
with
come
on
now
both
of
you
buckle
up
there
is
nothing
to
fear
if
you
do
what
i
tell
you
this
is
the
first
cholera
ship
i
been
aboard
it
was
no
pleasant
job
confronting
us
although
we
had
less
dead
men
to
handle
than
i
anticipated
indeed
we
found
only
five
bodies
on
board
and
as
the
slaver
must
have
originally
carried
a
large
crew
it
was
evident
the
survivors
had
thrown
overboard
the
corpses
of
those
who
succumbed
first
until
they
also
became
too
weak
to
perform
such
service
there
were
only
two
on
deck
the
fellow
crouched
on
the
grating
a
giant
coal
black
negro
and
a
white
man
his
face
pitted
with
smallpox
lying
beside
the
wheel
before
he
fell
to
the
deck
he
had
lashed
the
spokes
and
still
gripped
the
end
of
the
rope
in
his
dead
hand
determined
on
what
was
to
be
done
i
wasted
no
time
with
either
body
the
two
sailors
hung
back
so
terrorized
at
the
mere
thought
of
touching
these
victims
of
plague
i
steeled
myself
to
the
job
and
handled
them
alone
dragging
the
inert
bodies
across
the
deck
and
by
the
exercise
of
all
my
strength
launching
them
over
the
low
rail
into
the
sea
it
was
indeed
a
relief
to
know
the
deck
was
clear
and
i
ordered
schmitt
to
cut
the
lashings
and
take
charge
of
the
wheel
sam
was
shaking
like
a
leaf
his
face
absolutely
green
what
dey
die
of
sah
cholera
he
asked
faintly
no
doubt
of
it
but
they
are
safely
over
the
side
now
there
is
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
but
we
gits
it
sah
we
gits
it
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
i
contended
speaking
loud
and
confident
so
both
could
hear
we
are
all
in
good
health
and
in
the
open
air
see
here
you
men
stop
acting
like
fools
we
will
take
a
look
below
and
then
have
the
others
on
board
but
ah
suah
feared
sah
at
what
you
are
in
no
more
danger
than
i
am
see
here
sam
and
you
too
schmitt
i
am
in
love
with
that
girl
in
the
boat
do
you
suppose
i
would
ever
have
her
come
on
this
deck
if
i
believed
she
might
contract
cholera
you
do
as
i
say
and
you
are
perfectly
safe
now
schmitt
remain
at
the
wheel
and
you
sam
come
with
me
there
will
be
a
dead
nigger
aboard
unless
you
jump
when
i
speak
he
trotted
close
at
my
heels
as
i
flung
open
the
door
leading
into
the
cabin
the
air
seemed
fresh
enough
and
i
noted
two
of
the
ports
wide
open
a
tall
man
with
an
ugly
scar
down
one
cheek
lay
outstretched
on
a
divan
at
the
foot
of
the
after
mast
his
very
posture
proclaiming
him
dead
his
face
was
the
color
of
parchment
wrinkled
with
age
but
i
knew
him
at
once
as
spanish
a
uniform
cap
lay
beside
him
and
i
stopped
just
long
enough
to
scan
his
features
here
sam
do
you
know
this
fellow
the
negro
crept
up
behind
me
reluctantly
enough
and
stared
at
the
upturned
face
over
my
shoulder
my
gaud
sah
he
wus
de
ol
captain
the
one
you
served
under
what
was
his
name
paradilla
sah
damn
his
soul
a
slaver
i
suppose
well
he
run
his
last
cargo
of
niggers
look
into
the
rooms
they
were
empty
all
in
disorder
but
unoccupied
in
what
was
evidently
the
captain
room
i
discovered
a
pricked
chart
and
a
with
no
entry
in
it
for
three
days
without
waiting
to
examine
these
i
stowed
them
away
in
my
pocket
and
returned
to
paradilla
relieved
to
learn
our
labor
aft
was
so
light
and
eager
to
have
it
over
with
some
physical
persuasion
was
necessary
to
compel
sam
to
assist
me
but
finally
he
took
hold
and
between
us
we
forced
the
stiffened
form
of
the
captain
through
the
open
after
port
and
heard
it
splash
into
the
sea
astern
then
i
closed
the
cabin
door
and
led
the
way
forward
to
my
great
relief
the
hold
was
empty
although
the
smell
arising
through
the
partially
opened
hatch
was
stifling
the
reminder
of
a
cargo
lately
discharged
there
were
two
dead
seamen
in
the
forecastle
both
swarthy
fellows
with
long
indian
hair
i
never
saw
a
dirtier
hole
the
filth
overpowering
and
once
satisfied
that
both
men
were
beyond
help
i
was
content
to
lower
the
scuttle
and
leave
them
there
god
it
was
a
relief
to
return
once
more
to
the
open
deck
and
breathe
in
the
fresh
air
schmitt
was
holding
the
schooner
close
up
in
the
wind
which
however
was
barely
heavy
enough
to
keep
the
sails
full
yet
at
that
the
craft
was
making
the
best
of
it
leaving
a
long
wake
astern
the
waves
cresting
within
a
few
feet
of
her
rail
as
she
swept
gloriously
forward
i
leaned
over
and
hailed
the
boat
towing
below
come
aboard
watkins
i
called
sharply
pass
the
lady
up
first
and
turn
the
boat
adrift
what
is
she
sir
an
abandoned
slaver
i
tell
you
the
story
later
come
aboard
ay
ay
sir
i
caught
dorothy
hands
and
aided
her
over
the
rail
the
schooner
rode
steady
and
she
stood
still
grasping
me
her
eager
eyes
on
the
deck
aft
then
they
sought
my
face
questioningly
the
seamen
beginning
to
gather
between
us
and
the
rail
why
was
the
vessel
abandoned
she
asked
what
has
happened
do
you
know
yes
the
story
is
plain
enough
i
explained
deeming
it
best
to
tell
the
whole
truth
this
is
a
slaver
the
plying
between
cuba
and
the
african
coast
sam
the
negro
who
came
aboard
with
me
served
as
cook
on
board
for
one
voyage
i
do
not
know
why
they
should
be
in
these
waters
driven
north
by
a
storm
likely
but
cholera
was
the
trouble
the
crew
are
all
overboard
or
dead
overboard
or
dead
you
found
them
dead
the
slaves
also
no
there
were
no
slaves
the
hold
was
clear
we
found
a
few
dead
men
the
last
of
the
crew
to
survive
one
man
was
lying
beside
the
wheel
he
had
lashed
it
to
its
course
before
he
died
and
the
captain
was
in
the
cabin
and
he
was
dead
yes
a
tall
lean
spaniard
sam
said
his
name
was
paradilla
we
found
five
altogether
and
flung
their
bodies
over
the
side
except
two
sailors
in
the
forecastle
her
eyes
evidenced
her
horror
her
lips
barely
able
to
speak
they
they
died
of
cholera
all
of
them
there
was
no
one
left
alive
on
board
not
even
a
dog
it
was
a
tragedy
of
the
sea
of
which
we
will
never
know
all
the
truth
i
have
the
log
here
in
my
pocket
all
written
out
until
three
days
ago
perhaps
that
was
when
the
captain
died
but
can
you
imagine
anything
more
grim
more
horrible
than
this
schooner
with
all
sails
set
standing
on
her
course
with
a
dead
man
at
the
wheel
and
and
other
dead
men
in
cabin
and
forecastle
her
voice
broke
and
her
hands
covered
her
eyes
o
geoffry
must
we
stay
aboard
the
thought
is
terrible
besides
you
said
it
was
cholera
there
is
nothing
we
need
fear
i
insisted
firmly
clasping
the
upraised
hands
and
meeting
her
eyes
frankly
and
i
rely
upon
you
to
help
me
control
the
men
they
are
sailors
filled
with
superstition
and
will
look
to
us
for
leadership
please
do
not
fail
me
you
have
already
passed
through
too
much
to
be
frightened
at
a
shadow
this
is
a
staunch
vessel
provisioned
and
fit
for
any
sea
we
are
far
safer
here
than
in
the
boat
it
is
as
if
god
had
sent
us
deliverance
yet
we
face
disease
cholera
i
do
not
hold
that
a
peril
not
to
us
if
we
use
precautions
that
is
an
sea
danger
and
i
have
read
every
book
treating
of
the
disease
so
long
as
we
are
well
fed
and
keep
in
the
fresh
air
we
are
not
liable
to
suffer
the
dead
are
overboard
and
every
hatch
closed
i
will
have
the
deck
scoured
from
end
to
end
the
bedding
we
need
and
the
food
is
being
brought
up
from
the
boat
we
shall
come
in
contact
with
nothing
to
spread
the
disease
you
must
meet
this
emergency
just
as
bravely
as
you
have
the
others
you
will
will
you
not
her
eyes
met
mine
smilingly
resolute
if
you
say
so
yes
how
can
i
help
you
tell
the
men
just
what
i
have
told
you
i
said
gravely
they
will
pay
more
heed
to
what
you
say
and
will
be
ashamed
to
show
less
courage
than
you
do
you
agree
we
turned
and
faced
them
together
as
they
formed
a
little
group
against
the
rail
their
dunnage
together
with
a
few
boxes
of
provisions
and
a
couple
of
water
casks
lay
scattered
about
the
deck
and
now
their
immediate
task
done
the
fellows
were
sullenly
staring
around
hallin
was
first
to
speak
vot
vas
eet
you
say
dis
sheep
eet
haf
cholera
hey
dorothy
took
a
step
forward
and
confronted
them
her
cheeks
flushed
you
are
sailors
she
said
speaking
swiftly
and
ought
not
to
be
afraid
if
a
girl
is
it
is
true
this
vessel
was
ravaged
by
cholera
and
the
crew
died
but
the
bodies
have
been
flung
overboard
captain
carlyle
risked
his
life
to
do
that
before
he
asked
us
aboard
now
there
is
no
danger
so
long
as
we
remain
on
deck
i
have
no
fear
the
swede
shook
his
head
grumbling
something
but
before
the
revolt
could
spread
watkins
broke
in
an
that
right
miss
i
wus
on
the
when
she
took
cholera
an
we
hed
days
of
it
beatin
agin
head
winds
off
the
cape
we
lost
sixteen
o
the
crew
but
not
a
man
among
us
who
stayed
on
deck
got
sick
anyhow
these
blokes
are
goin
ter
try
their
luck
aboard

er
else
swim
fer

he
grinned
cheerfully
letting
slip
the
end
of
the
painter
the
released
gliding
gently
away
astern
the
width
of
water
constantly
increasing
the

jump
fer

if
yer
want
ter
go
why
do
yer
try
it
ole
you
are
so
keen
about
getting
away
you
ought
not

so
ye
prefer
to
stay
along
with
the
rest
of
us
all
right
then
my
hearties
let
hunt
up
something
to
work
with
and
scrub
this
deck
that
the
way
to
clean
out
cholera
he
led
the
way
and
they
followed
him
grumbling
and
cursing
but
obedient
i
added
a
word
of
encouragement
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
gang
was
busily
engaged
in
clearing
up
the
mess
forward
making
use
of
whatever
came
to
hand
their
first
fears
evidently
forgotten
in
action
watkins
kept
after
them
like
a
slave
driver
that
the
style
throw
all
the
litter
overboard
bend
your
back
pierre
now
ole
take
hold
here
what
the
hell
are
you
men
loafing
for
now
heave
altogether
i
glanced
astern
catching
a
fleeting
glimpse
beneath
the
main
boom
of
the
disappearing
bobbing
up
and
down
in
the
distance
then
my
eyes
sought
the
face
of
the
girl
she
met
my
gaze
with
a
smile
they
are
all
right
now
are
they
not
she
asked
yes
as
long
as
they
can
be
kept
busy
and
i
will
see
to
that
go
aft
and
get
out
of
this
mess
i
want
to
plan
our
voyage
it
was
not
difficult
finding
plenty
for
the
lads
to
do
making
the
neglected
schooner
shipshape
and
adjusting
the
spread
of
canvas
aloft
to
the
new
course
i
decided
upon
fortunately
we
had
men
enough
to
manipulate
the
sails
real
seamen
able
to
work
swiftly
sam
started
a
fire
in
the
galley
and
prepared
a
hot
meal
singing
as
he
worked
and
before
noon
i
had
as
cheerful
a
ship
crew
forward
as
any
man
could
possibly
ask
for
the
weather
kept
pleasant
but
with
a
heavy
wind
blowing
compelling
us
to
take
a
reef
in
the
canvas
but
the
schooner
was
an
excellent
sea
boat
and
all
alike
felt
the
exhilaration
of
rapid
progress
dorothy
and
i
glanced
over
the
log
but
gained
little
information
the
vessel
had
been
driven
into
the
northwest
by
a
succession
of
storms
and
lack
of
provisions
had
weakened
the
crew
cholera
broke
out
among
them
the
third
day
at
sea
the
first
victim
being
the
cabin
steward
with
no
medicine
chest
aboard
and
everything
below
foul
the
disease
spread
rapidly
within
hours
sixteen
bodies
were
thrown
overboard
and
in
their
terror
the
remainder
of
the
crew
mutinied
and
refused
to
work
ship
both
mates
died
and
finally
only
three
men
were
left
alive
a
negro
known
as
juan
the
gabriel
lossier
and
the
captain
who
was
already
lying
sick
and
helpless
in
the
cabin
that
was
the
last
entry
barely
decipherable
as
the
sun
reached
the
meridian
i
ventured
again
into
the
cabin
and
returned
with
the
necessary
instruments
to
determine
our
position
with
these
and
the
pricked
chart
i
managed
fairly
well
in
determining
our
location
and
choosing
the
most
direct
course
toward
the
coast
dorothy
watched
closely
and
when
i
looked
up
from
the
paper
the
men
were
gathered
about
the
open
door
of
the
galley
equally
interested
i
ordered
watkins
to
send
them
all
aft
and
as
they
ranged
up
across
the
narrow
deck
i
spread
out
the
chart
before
them
and
explained
as
best
i
could
our
situation
and
what
i
proposed
doing
i
doubt
if
many
were
able
to
comprehend
yet
some
grasped
my
meaning
bending
over
the
map
and
asking
questions
pointing
to
this
and
that
mark
with
stubby
forefingers
from
their
muttered
remarks
i
judged
their
only
anxiety
was
to
get
ashore
as
early
as
possible
out
of
this
death
ship
convinced
this
was
also
my
object
they
ventured
forward
cheerfully
as
i
rolled
up
the
chart
and
placed
it
in
the
flag
locker
one
of
the
frenchmen
relieved
schmitt
at
the
wheel
and
a
little
later
sam
served
dorothy
and
i
on
deck
the
food
was
appetizing
and
well
cooked
and
we
lingered
over
it
for
some
time
while
watkins
busied
the
men
forward
chapter
xxviii
a
new
plan
of
escape
nothing
occurred
during
the
afternoon
to
disturb
the
routine
work
aboard
or
to
cause
me
any
uneasiness
the
swift
slaver
made
excellent
progress
in
spite
of
light
winds
and
proved
easy
to
handle
watkins
found
enough
to
occupy
the
crew
on
deck
and
aloft
and
they
seemed
contented
although
i
noticed
the
fellows
gathered
together
in
groups
whenever
idle
and
discussed
the
situation
earnestly
while
they
might
not
be
entirely
satisfied
and
no
doubt
some
fear
lingered
in
their
minds
the
fellows
lacked
leadership
for
any
revolt
and
would
remain
quiet
for
the
present
at
least
i
made
one
more
trip
into
the
desolate
cabin
returning
with
pipes
and
tobacco
which
i
took
forward
and
distributed
an
ample
supply
for
all
the
crew
as
the
men
smoked
watkins
and
i
leaned
over
the
rail
and
discussed
the
situation
sunset
brought
clouds
and
by
the
time
it
was
really
dark
the
entire
sky
was
overcast
but
the
sea
remained
comparatively
calm
and
the
wind
steady
i
judged
we
were
making
in
the
neighborhood
of
nine
knots
and
carefully
pricked
my
chart
to
assure
myself
of
our
position
even
at
that
i
was
not
entirely
satisfied
although
i
kept
this
lack
of
faith
hidden
from
the
others
dorothy
however
who
kept
close
beside
me
much
of
the
time
must
have
sensed
my
doubt
to
some
extent
for
once
she
questioned
me
curiously
are
you
not
sure
of
your
figures
she
asked
glancing
from
the
chart
into
my
face
that
is
three
times
you
have
measured
the
distance
it
is
not
the
figures
it
is
the
accuracy
of
the
chart
i
explained
it
is
not
new
for
the
schooner
evidently
seldom
made
this
coast
and
it
was
probably
only
by
chance
that
they
had
such
a
map
aboard
even
the
best
of
the
charts
are
not
absolutely
correct
and
this
one
may
be
entirely
wrong
i
shall
rely
more
on
keeping
a
careful
watch
tonight
than
on
the
map
you
see
this
cape
for
all
i
know
it
may
jut
out
fifty
miles
east
of
where
it
appears
to
be
and
we
might
run
into
shoal
water
at
any
minute
she
wrinkled
her
brows
over
the
lines
on
the
map
and
then
stared
out
across
the
darkening
sea
without
speaking
it
was
a
pleasant
night
in
spite
of
the
darkness
the
air
soft
and
refreshing
we
divided
the
men
into
watches
watkins
selecting
the
more
capable
for
lookouts
i
explained
to
these
the
danger
and
posted
them
on
the
forecastle
heads
ready
to
respond
instantly
to
any
call
i
could
see
the
glow
of
their
pipes
for
some
time
but
finally
these
went
out
one
by
one
and
the
growl
of
voices
ceased
the
schooner
was
in
darkness
except
for
a
faint
reflection
from
the
binnacle
light
aft
revealing
the
dim
figure
of
the
helmsman
overhead
the
canvas
disappeared
into
the
gloom
of
the
sky
the
locker
was
filled
with
flags
representing
almost
every
nation
on
earth
evidently
the
was
willing
to
fly
any
colors
which
would
insure
safety
or
allay
suspicion
in
her
nefarious
trade
i
dragged
these
out
and
spread
them
on
the
deck
abaft
the
cabin
thus
forming
a
very
comfortable
bed
and
at
last
induced
the
girl
to
lie
down
wrapping
her
in
a
blanket
but
although
she
reclined
there
and
rested
she
was
in
no
mood
for
sleep
and
whenever
my
restless
wandering
brought
me
near
i
was
made
aware
of
her
wakefulness
finally
i
found
a
seat
beside
her
on
a
coil
of
rope
and
we
fell
into
conversation
which
must
have
lasted
for
an
hour
or
more
i
shall
never
forget
that
dark
ship
deck
with
no
sound
breaking
the
silence
except
the
soft
swirl
of
water
alongside
the
occasional
flap
of
canvas
aloft
and
the
creak
of
the
wheel
dorothy
was
but
a
shrouded
figure
as
she
sat
wrapped
in
her
blanket
and
the
only
other
object
visible
was
the
dim
outline
of
the
helmsman
we
seemed
to
be
completely
shut
in
between
sea
and
sky
lost
and
forgotten
yet
the
memory
of
the
tragedy
this
vessel
had
witnessed
remained
with
me
the
helpless
slaves
who
had
suffered
and
died
between
decks
the
dead
sailors
in
the
forecastle
their
ghastly
faces
staring
up
at
the
beams
above
and
the
horrible
figure
of
paradilla
outstretched
on
the
cabin
divan
i
was
a
sailor
and
could
not
feel
that
any
good
fortune
would
come
to
us
from
such
a
death
ship
the
memory
brought
to
me
a
depression
hard
to
throw
off
yet
for
her
sake
i
pretended
a
cheerfulness
i
was
far
from
feeling
and
our
conversation
drifted
idly
into
many
channels
this
was
the
first
opportunity
we
had
enjoyed
to
actually
talk
with
each
other
alone
and
gradually
our
thoughts
veered
from
the
happenings
of
the
strange
voyage
and
our
present
predicament
to
those
personal
matters
in
which
we
were
peculiarly
interested
i
know
not
how
it
occurred
for
what
had
passed
between
us
in
the
open
boat
seemed
more
like
a
dream
than
a
reality
yet
my
hand
found
her
own
beneath
the
blanket
and
i
dared
to
whisper
the
words
my
lips
could
no
longer
restrain
dorothy
i
said
humbly
you
were
frightened
last
night
i
can
not
hold
you
to
what
you
said
to
me
then
you
mean
you
do
not
wish
to
but
i
was
not
frightened
they
were
honest
words
you
have
not
regretted
them
since
no
geoffry
perhaps
they
were
not
maidenly
yet
were
they
honest
why
should
i
not
have
told
you
the
truth
i
have
long
known
my
own
heart
and
yours
as
well
and
you
still
repeat
what
you
said
then
perhaps
i
do
not
remember
all
i
said
i
can
never
forget
you
said
love
you
she
drew
a
quick
breath
and
for
an
instant
remained
silent
then
her
courage
conquered
yes
i
can
repeat
that
i
love
you
those
are
dear
dear
words
but
i
ought
not
to
listen
to
them
or
believe
i
am
not
free
to
ask
a
pledge
of
you
or
to
beg
you
to
trust
me
in
marriage
is
not
that
rather
for
me
to
decide
she
questioned
archly
i
give
you
my
faith
geoffry
and
surely
no
girl
ever
had
more
reason
to
know
the
heart
of
a
man
than
i
you
have
risked
all
to
serve
me
and
i
would
be
ungrateful
indeed
were
i
insensible
of
the
sacrifice
yet
do
not
think
that
is
all
gratitude
for
what
you
have
done
i
did
not
need
that
to
teach
me
your
nature
i
make
a
confession
now
you
remember
the
night
i
met
you
on
deck
when
you
were
a
prisoner
and
told
you
that
you
had
become
the
property
of
roger
fairfax
i
could
never
forget
nor
i
loved
you
then
although
i
scarcely
acknowledged
the
truth
even
to
myself
i
went
back
to
my
berth
to
lie
awake
and
think
until
morning
a
new
world
had
come
to
me
and
when
the
dawn
broke
i
knew
what
it
all
meant
that
my
heart
was
yours
i
cared
nothing
because
you
were
a
prisoner
a
bound
slave
under
sentence
we
are
all
alike
we
fairfax
we
choose
for
ourselves
and
laugh
at
the
world
that
is
my
answer
geoffry
carlyle
i
give
you
love
for
love
is
a
strange
place
for
such
a
pledge
with
only
hope
before
us
a
fit
place
to
my
mind
in
memory
of
our
life
together
thus
far
for
all
the
way
it
has
been
stress
and
danger
and
what
more
can
we
ask
than
hope
i
would
ask
an
opportunity
denied
me
to
stand
once
more
in
honor
among
men
i
would
not
be
shamed
before
dorothy
fairfax
nor
need
you
be
she
exclaimed
impetuously
her
hands
pressing
mine
you
wrong
yourself
even
as
you
have
been
wronged
you
have
already
done
that
which
shall
win
you
freedom
if
it
be
properly
presented
to
those
in
power
i
mean
that
it
shall
be
once
i
am
safely
back
in
virginia
tell
me
what
are
your
plans
with
with
this
schooner
to
beach
it
somewhere
along
shore
and
leave
it
there
a
wreck
while
we
escape
i
suspected
as
much
yet
is
that
the
best
way
the
only
way
which
has
occurred
to
me
the
men
insist
on
it
with
good
reason
they
have
been
pirates
and
might
be
hung
if
caught
and
yet
to
my
mind
she
insisted
earnestly
that
choice
is
most
dangerous
i
am
a
girl
but
if
i
commanded
here
do
you
know
what
i
would
do
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
i
would
sail
this
vessel
straight
to
the
chesapeake
and
surrender
it
to
the
authorities
the
men
have
nothing
to
fear
with
me
aboard
and
ready
to
testify
in
their
behalf
the
governor
will
accept
my
word
without
a
question
these
men
are
not
pirates
but
honest
seamen
compelled
to
serve
in
order
to
save
their
lives
they
mutinied
and
captured
the
bark
but
were
later
overcome
and
compelled
to
take
the
boats
the
same
plea
can
be
made
for
you
geoffry
only
you
were
there
in
an
effort
to
save
me
it
is
a
service
which
ought
to
win
you
freedom
but
if
it
does
not
i
pledge
you
my
word
it
shall
if
the
governor
fail
me
i
will
bear
my
story
to
the
feet
of
the
king
i
am
a
fairfax
and
we
have
friends
in
england
strong
powerful
friends
they
will
listen
and
aid
me
i
am
convinced
i
admitted
after
a
pause
that
this
course
is
the
wiser
one
but
fear
the
opposition
of
the
men
they
will
never
go
willingly
there
is
an
argument
which
will
overcome
their
fear
you
mean
force
no
although
i
doubt
not
that
might
suffice
i
mean
cupidity
each
sailor
aboard
has
an
interest
in
the
salvage
of
this
vessel
under
the
english
law
you
tell
me
the
schooner
was
a
slaver
driven
out
to
sea
by
storm
immediately
after
discharging
a
cargo
of
slaves
there
must
be
gold
aboard
perhaps
treasure
also
for
i
can
not
think
a
slaver
above
piracy
if
chance
arose
let
the
crew
dream
that
dream
and
you
will
need
no
whip
to
drive
them
into
an
english
port
full
pardon
and
possibly
wealth
with
it
i
laughed
a
beautiful
scheme
dorothy
yet
it
might
work
still
if
i
know
sailormen
they
would
doubt
the
truth
if
it
came
direct
from
me
for
i
am
not
really
one
of
them
but
watkins
is
and
he
has
intelligence
explain
it
all
to
him
tell
him
who
i
am
the
influence
i
can
wield
in
the
colony
and
then
let
him
whisper
the
news
to
the
others
will
you
not
do
this
for
my
sake
yes
i
answered
i
believe
you
have
found
the
right
course
if
you
will
promise
to
lie
down
and
sleep
i
will
talk
with
watkins
now
i
promise
but
are
you
not
going
to
rest
very
little
tonight
i
may
catch
some
catnaps
before
morning
but
most
of
the
time
shall
be
prowling
about
deck
you
see
i
have
no
officers
to
rely
upon
but
do
worry
about
me
this
sort
of
life
is
not
new
good
night
dear
girl
she
extended
her
arms
and
drew
me
down
until
our
lips
met
you
are
actually
afraid
of
me
still
she
said
wonderingly
why
should
you
be
i
can
not
tell
i
have
never
known
what
it
was
before
somehow
dorothy
you
have
always
seemed
so
far
away
from
me
i
have
never
been
able
to
forget
but
now
the
touch
of
your
lips
has
broken
down
the
last
barrier
yes
forever
are
you
sure
would
you
not
feel
still
less
doubt
if
you
kissed
me
again
i
held
her
closely
gazing
down
into
the
dimly
revealed
outline
of
her
face
and
this
time
felt
myself
the
master
now
i
am
sure
sweetheart
i
whispered
the
note
of
joy
ringing
in
the
words
that
i
have
won
the
most
precious
gift
in
the
world
yet
your
safety
and
those
of
all
on
board
is
in
my
hands
tonight
i
must
not
forget
that
i
am
going
now
to
find
watkins
and
you
have
promised
to
lie
down
and
sleep
to
lie
down
she
corrected
but
whether
to
sleep
i
can
not
tell
i
left
her
there
lying
hidden
and
shapeless
on
the
deck
beneath
the
cover
of
the
blanket
her
head
pillowed
on
the
flags
and
groped
my
own
way
forward
pausing
a
moment
to
gaze
into
the
binnacle
and
exchange
a
word
with
the
man
at
the
wheel
i
found
watkins
awake
seated
on
the
forecastle
steps
where
i
joined
him
lighting
my
own
pipe
for
companionship
our
conversation
gradually
drifting
toward
the
point
i
came
to
make
he
listened
gravely
to
what
i
had
to
say
with
little
comment
and
was
evidently
weighing
every
argument
in
his
mind
i
bin
in
virginia
and
maryland
sir
he
said
at
last
seriously
and
if
the
young
woman
is
a
fairfax
she
likely
have
influence
enough
ter
do
just
whut
she
says
they
ai
ter
pirates
in
them
provinces
o
late
i
bin
told
but
the
savin
o
her
life
wud
make
a
heap
o
difference
with
the
governor
yer
know
she
a
fairfax
absolutely
i
told
you
the
story
that
night
in
the
forecastle
and
i
take
more
risk
than
any
of
you
in
giving
myself
up
i
was
bound
in
servitude
to
her
uncle
roger
fairfax
and
am
therefore
a
runaway
slave
well
he
agreed
i
talk
it
over
with
the
lads
it
a
good
story
an
i
be
ready
ter
take
chances
but
i
ai
so
sure
sir
on
makin
feel
the
same
way
all
most
of
think
about
is
ter
escape
bein
hanged
if
they
wus
only
sure
thar
wus
treasure
aboard
like
you
suspicion
there
may
be
i
guess
most
of
would
face
hell
ter
git
their
hands
on
a
share
of
it
then
why
not
search
and
see
he
shook
his
head
obstinately
and
his
face
showing
in
the
dull
glow
of
the
pipe
proved
that
he
sturdy
intelligent
seaman
as
he
was
shared
to
no
small
extent
the
fears
of
the
others
not
me
sir
i
do
prowl
around
in
no
cholera
ship
loaded
with
dead
men
not
if
i
never
git
rich
then
i
will
and
i
got
to
my
feet
in
sudden
determination
you
keep
the
deck
while
i
go
below
have
you
seen
a
lantern
on
board
anywhere
ay
sir
there
one
hangin
in
the
cook
galley

damn
coward
mr
carlyle
oh

of
us
sailors
but
you

make
this
crew

easier

promise
to

girl

is
any
specie
hidden
aboard
this
hooker

will
be
either
in
the
cabin
or
lazaret
and
whether
there
is
or
not
my
man
the
turns
north
tomorrow
if
i
have
to
fight
every
sea
wolf
on
board
chapter
xxix
a
struggle
in
the
dark
he
came
back
with
it
swinging
in
his
hand
a
mere
tin
box
containing
a
candle
the
dim
flame
visible
through
numerous
punctures
it
promised
poor
guidance
enough
yet
emitted
sufficient
light
to
show
the
way
around
in
that
darkness
below
so
as
not
to
arouse
suspicion
i
wrapped
the
thing
in
a
blanket
and
with
watkins
beside
me
started
aft
dorothy
must
have
been
asleep
already
for
there
was
no
sign
of
movement
as
we
passed
where
she
was
lying
neither
of
us
spoke
until
my
hand
was
on
the
companion
door
ready
to
slide
it
open
i
not
be
long
below
i
said
soberly
and
meanwhile
you
keep
a
sharp
watch
on
deck
better
go
forward
and
see
that
your
lookout
men
are
awake
and
then
come
back
here
likely
i
have
a
story
to
tell
you
by
that
time
the
wind
seems
lessening
yes
sir
shall
we
shake
out
a
reef
in
the
foresail
not
yet
watkins
wait
until
i
learn
what
secret
is
below
an
hour
will
make
little
difference
with
the
lantern
held
before
me
its
faint
light
barely
piercing
the
intense
darkness
i
stood
on
the
first
step
leading
down
into
the
cabin
and
slid
the
door
back
into
place
behind
me
i
had
no
sense
of
fear
yet
felt
a
nervous
tension
to
which
i
was
scarcely
accustomed
for
the
instant
i
hesitated
to
descend
into
the
gloom
of
that
interior
the
constant
nerve
strain
under
which
i
had
labored
for
days
and
nights
made
me
shrink
from
groping
blindly
forward
searching
for
the
unknown
the
very
darkness
seemed
haunted
and
i
could
not
drive
from
my
memory
the
figure
of
that
dead
captain
whose
life
had
ended
there
it
even
seemed
to
me
i
could
smell
foulness
in
the
air
that
i
was
breathing
in
cholera
yet
i
drove
this
terror
from
me
with
a
laugh
remembering
the
open
ports
through
which
the
fresh
wind
was
blowing
and
cursing
myself
for
a
fool
began
the
descent
guided
by
the
flickering
rays
of
light
i
was
conscious
of
a
quickening
pulse
as
i
peered
about
me
in
the
gloom
every
article
of
furniture
assuming
grotesque
form
the
rustling
of
a
bit
of
cloth
over
one
of
the
open
ports
caused
me
to
face
about
suddenly
while
every
creak
of
the
vessel
seemed
the
echo
of
a
human
voice
a
blanket
in
the
form
of
a
roll
lay
on
the
divan
where
i
had
found
captain
paradilla
and
for
a
moment
as
i
stared
at
it
dimly
visible
in
a
ray
of
light
i
imagined
this
was
his
motionless
figure
indeed
i
was
so
strung
up
it
required
all
my
reserve
of
courage
to
persevere
and
traverse
the
black
deck
my
mind
was
fixed
on
a
great
chest
in
the
captain
stateroom
which
finding
locked
i
had
not
disturbed
on
my
former
visit
but
first
i
explored
the
steward
pantry
in
search
of
knife
or
hatchet
i
found
the
latter
and
with
it
tucked
into
my
belt
felt
my
way
aft
it
may
have
required
five
minutes
to
pry
open
the
chest
and
the
reward
was
scarcely
worth
the
effort
the
upper
tray
contained
nothing
but
clothing
and
beneath
this
were
books
and
nautical
instruments
with
a
bag
of
specie
tucked
into
one
corner
together
with
a
small
packet
of
letters
i
opened
the
sack
finding
therein
a
strange
collection
of
coins
mostly
spanish
estimating
the
total
roughly
at
possibly
five
hundred
english
pounds
either
this
was
paradilla
private
purse
or
money
kept
on
hand
to
meet
the
expenses
of
the
voyage
i
searched
the
room
thoroughly
discovering
nothing
finally
concluding
that
if
there
was
treasure
on
board
it
must
be
concealed
elsewhere
i
did
find
however
that
which
strengthened
my
suspicion
for
in
rummaging
hastily
through
a
drawer
of
the
rude
desk
i
came
upon
a
bill
of
sale
for
a
thousand
slaves
dated
two
weeks
before
but
unsigned
although
the
parties
mentioned
within
the
document
were
paradilla
and
a
merchant
of
habana
named
carlos
martinos
this
would
evidence
the
sale
for
cash
of
the
late
cargo
of
the
a
goodly
sum
but
whether
the
amount
had
been
left
ashore
remained
undecided
only
a
careful
search
of
the
vessel
could
determine
this
however
this
discovery
nerved
me
to
press
forward
with
my
exploration
all
fear
and
dread
had
left
me
and
i
went
at
the
task
coolly
enough
and
with
a
clear
purpose
there
remained
aft
two
places
unvisited
the
lazaret
and
the
port
stateroom
which
i
had
not
previously
entered
because
of
a
locked
door
i
determined
on
breaking
in
here
first
suspecting
its
use
as
a
storeroom
there
was
no
key
in
the
lock
and
the
stout
door
resisted
my
efforts
placing
the
lantern
on
the
deck
i
succeeded
finally
in
inserting
the
blade
of
the
hatchet
so
as
to
gain
a
purchase
sufficient
to
release
the
latch
as
the
door
yielded
the
hinges
creaking
dismally
a
sharp
cry
human
in
its
agony
assailed
me
from
within
it
came
forth
so
suddenly
and
with
so
wild
an
accent
i
stepped
blindly
backward
in
fright
my
foot
overturning
the
lantern
which
with
a
single
flicker
of
candle
went
out
in
that
last
gleam
i
saw
a
form
either
of
man
or
boy
a
dim
grotesque
outline
fronting
me
then
in
the
darkness
gleamed
two
green
menacing
eyes
growing
steadily
larger
nearer
as
i
stared
at
them
in
horror
i
could
not
move
i
seemed
paralyzed
i
doubt
if
i
even
breathed
in
that
first
moment
of
overwhelming
terror
another
cry
like
that
of
a
mad
person
struck
my
ears
and
i
knew
the
thing
was
coming
toward
me
there
was
no
other
sound
no
footstep
on
the
deck
i
merely
felt
the
approach
realizing
the
increasing
glare
of
those
horrible
eyes
they
seemed
to
fascinate
to
hold
me
immovable
the
blood
chilled
in
my
veins
was
it
man
or
beast
devil
from
hell
or
some
crazed
human
against
whom
i
must
battle
for
life
the
green
eyes
glared
into
my
face
i
could
even
feel
the
hot
breath
of
the
monster
i
lifted
my
hand
toward
him
and
touched
hair
even
as
the
creature
grip
caught
me
ripping
through
jacket
sleeve
to
the
flesh
i
knew
what
my
antagonist
was
a
giant
african
ape
horrible
as
the
reality
was
i
was
no
longer
paralyzed
with
fear
helpless
before
the
unknown
this
was
something
real
something
to
grasp
and
struggle
against
a
beast
with
which
to
pit
strength
and
skill
the
sting
of
the
claws
maddened
me
brought
me
instantly
to
life
and
i
drove
my
hatchet
straight
between
those
two
gleaming
eyes
i
know
not
how
it
struck
but
the
brute
staggered
back
dragging
me
with
him
in
the
clutch
of
his
claws
his
cry
of
pain
ended
in
a
brutal
snarl
but
brief
as
the
respite
proved
it
gave
me
grip
on
his
under
jaw
and
an
opportunity
to
drive
my
weapon
twice
more
against
the
hairy
face
the
pain
served
only
to
madden
the
beast
and
before
i
could
wrench
free
he
had
me
clutched
in
an
iron
grip
my
jacket
torn
into
shreds
his
jaws
snapped
at
my
face
but
i
had
such
purchase
as
to
prevent
their
touching
me
and
mindless
of
the
claws
tearing
at
my
flesh
i
forced
the
animal
head
back
until
the
neck
cracked
and
the
lips
gave
vent
to
a
wild
scream
of
agony
i
dared
not
let
go
dared
not
relax
for
an
instant
the
exercise
of
every
ounce
of
strength
i
felt
as
though
the
life
was
being
squeezed
out
of
me
by
the
grasp
of
those
hairy
arms
yet
the
very
vice
in
which
i
was
held
yielded
me
leverage
the
hatchet
dropped
to
the
deck
and
both
hands
found
lodgment
under
the
jaw
the
muscles
of
my
arms
strained
to
the
utmost
as
i
forced
back
that
horrid
head
little
by
little
it
gave
way
the
suffering
brute
whining
in
agony
until
the
pain
becoming
unendurable
the
clinging
arms
suddenly
released
their
hold
letting
me
drop
heavily
to
the
deck
by
some
good
fortune
i
fell
upon
the
discarded
hatchet
and
stumbled
to
my
feet
once
more
gripping
the
weapon
again
in
my
fingers
i
stood
trembling
breathing
hard
my
flesh
burning
peering
about
the
darkness
revealed
nothing
yet
i
knew
i
had
been
dragged
within
the
stateroom
from
which
there
was
no
escape
as
i
had
lost
all
sense
of
direction
for
an
instant
i
could
not
even
locate
the
brute
with
an
intense
desire
to
escape
to
place
the
door
safely
between
me
and
my
antagonist
i
felt
blindly
about
in
the
black
void
silently
as
i
endeavored
to
move
i
must
have
been
overheard
by
the
beast
for
suddenly
his
jaws
snapped
savagely
and
i
saw
once
again
the
baneful
glow
of
those
horrible
eyes
i
knew
enough
of
wild
life
to
realize
that
now
the
ape
feared
me
and
that
my
safer
course
was
to
attack
acting
on
this
impulse
determined
to
have
an
end
before
he
could
grip
me
once
more
in
those
awful
arms
and
crush
me
into
unconsciousness
i
sprang
straight
toward
him
sending
the
sharp
blade
of
the
hatchet
crashing
against
the
skull
the
aim
was
good
the
stroke
a
death
blow
yet
the
monster
got
me
with
one
jaw
and
we
fell
to
the
deck
together
he
savagely
clawing
me
in
his
death
agony
then
the
hairy
figure
quivered
and
lay
motionless
with
barely
strength
enough
for
the
task
i
released
the
stiffening
grip
and
crept
aside
rising
to
my
knees
only
to
immediately
pitch
forward
unconscious
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
went
down
that
i
heard
voices
saw
lights
flashing
in
the
outer
cabin
but
all
these
merged
instantly
into
blackness
when
i
came
back
once
more
to
life
i
knew
immediately
i
was
upon
the
schooner
deck
breathing
the
fresh
night
air
i
could
see
the
outline
of
the
helmsman
in
the
little
circle
of
binnacle
light
a
ray
of
which
extended
far
enough
to
assure
me
of
the
presence
of
dorothy
i
watched
her
for
some
time
my
mind
slowly
clearing
to
the
situation
and
it
was
not
until
i
spoke
that
she
became
aware
i
had
recovered
consciousness
dorothy
yes
yes
she
bent
lower
eagerly
oh
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
you
speak
watkins
said
you
were
not
seriously
hurt
but
your
clothes
were
torn
into
shreds
and
you
bled
terribly
it
was
not
a
nightmare
then
i
really
fought
that
beast
yes
but
it
is
too
horrible
to
think
about
i
i
shall
never
blot
out
the
sight
you
saw
what
occurred
yourself
i
questioned
in
astonishment
you
actually
came
below
then
i
did
hear
voices
and
see
a
light
before
my
senses
left
me
yes
watkins
heard
the
noise
of
struggle
the
cries
of
the
brute
and
woke
me
at
first
he
was
afraid
to
go
into
the
cabin
but
i
made
him
rather
than
let
me
go
alone
the
only
light
we
had
was
a
torch
made
from
a
rope
end
we
got
there
just
as
you
fell
i
saw
you
staggering
on
your
knees
and
that
beast
outstretched
on
deck
a
great
gash
in
its
skull
watkins
says
it
was
a
chimpanzee
it
was
a
huge
ape
of
some
kind
crazed
with
hunger
no
doubt
i
sat
up
aware
of
the
smart
of
my
wounds
but
already
convinced
they
were
not
deep
or
dangerous
you
did
not
look
about
you
took
no
note
of
what
was
in
the
room
no
puzzled
at
my
sudden
interest
i
had
no
thought
of
anything
but
you
at
first
i
believed
you
dead
until
i
felt
the
beat
of
your
pulse
the
light
revealed
little
until
watkins
found
the
overturned
lantern
and
relit
the
candle
but
i
saw
not
even
that
much
the
fight
was
in
pitch
darkness
yet
i
struck
against
things
not
furniture
what
were
they
oh
you
mean
that
i
think
it
must
have
been
a
storeroom
of
some
kind
for
there
were
casks
and
boxes
piled
up
and
a
strange
chest
was
against
one
wall
i
sat
on
it
and
held
the
lantern
while
watkins
saw
to
your
wounds
then
we
carried
you
up
here
that
is
the
answer
i
sought
yes
you
must
let
me
get
up
dear
oh
i
can
stand
alone
a
little
weak
from
loss
of
blood
yet
but
none
the
worse
off
where
is
watkins
he
went
forward
do
you
need
him
perhaps
it
can
wait
until
daylight
you
know
what
i
ventured
below
for
to
learn
if
there
was
treasure
hidden
aboard
you
hoped
such
a
discovery
would
induce
the
men
to
sail
this
schooner
to
the
chesapeake
yes
and
now
i
believe
there
is
hidden
away
in
the
locked
room
and
guarded
by
that
ape
in
all
probability
no
one
but
paradilla
knew
the
creature
was
on
board
and
he
could
have
had
no
better
guardian
no
sailor
would
ever
face
the
brute
we
may
have
talked
there
for
an
hour
watkins
joining
us
finally
and
listening
to
my
story
my
wounds
while
painful
enough
were
all
of
the
flesh
and
the
flow
of
blood
being
easily
staunched
my
strength
returned
quickly
to
my
surprise
the
hour
was
but
little
after
midnight
and
i
had
so
far
recovered
when
the
watch
was
changed
as
to
insist
on
watkins
going
forward
leaving
me
in
charge
of
the
deck
i
felt
no
desire
for
sleep
and
so
he
finally
yielded
to
my
orders
and
curled
up
in
a
blanket
in
the
lee
of
the
galley
the
girl
was
harder
to
manage
yet
when
i
left
her
alone
she
lay
down
on
her
bed
of
flags
twice
later
she
lifted
her
head
and
spoke
as
i
passed
but
at
last
remained
motionless
while
i
carefully
covered
her
with
an
extra
blanket
the
time
did
not
seem
long
to
me
as
i
paced
the
deserted
deck
aft
or
went
forward
occasionally
to
assure
myself
that
the
lookouts
on
the
forecastle
were
alert
there
was
nothing
to
see
or
do
the
sea
and
sky
both
so
black
as
to
be
indistinguishable
and
the
breeze
barely
heavy
enough
to
distend
the
canvas
giving
the
schooner
a
speed
not
to
exceed
six
knots
i
suspicioned
a
storm
in
the
hatching
but
nothing
evidenced
its
near
approach
however
my
thoughts
busied
me
and
vanished
all
drowsiness
i
believed
i
had
won
a
way
to
freedom
to
a
government
pardon
the
good
fortune
which
had
befallen
me
in
the
salvage
of
this
vessel
as
well
as
our
success
against
the
pirates
of
the
could
scarcely
be
ignored
by
the
authorities
of
virginia
while
the
rescue
of
dorothy
fairfax
and
her
pleading
in
our
behalf
would
commend
us
to
mercy
and
reward
from
the
very
highest
officials
the
money
the
treasure
i
personally
thought
nothing
about
willing
enough
that
it
should
go
to
others
but
i
was
ambitious
to
regain
my
honor
among
men
my
place
of
respectability
in
the
world
for
the
one
vital
purpose
which
now
dominated
my
mind
that
i
might
claim
dorothy
fairfax
with
clean
hands
my
love
and
the
confession
of
her
own
had
brought
to
me
a
new
vista
a
fresh
hope
it
seemed
to
me
already
her
faith
had
inspired
me
with
new
power
power
to
transform
dream
into
reality
i
stood
above
her
motionless
figure
as
she
lay
asleep
and
solemnly
took
a
resolve
at
whatever
cost
to
myself
or
others
the
should
sail
in
between
the
capes
to
the
waters
of
the
chesapeake
be
the
result
reward
or
punishment
liberty
or
freedom
the
chance
must
be
accepted
for
her
sake
as
well
as
my
own
chapter
xxx
opening
the
treasure
chest
the
dawn
came
slowly
and
with
but
little
increase
of
light
the
breeze
had
almost
entirely
died
away
leaving
the
canvas
aloft
motionless
the
schooner
barely
moving
through
a
slightly
heaving
sea
in
the
midst
of
a
mist
it
was
a
dismal
outlook
the
decks
wet
the
sails
dripping
moisture
and
nothing
to
look
about
upon
but
wreaths
of
fog
even
as
the
sun
rose
its
rays
failed
to
penetrate
this
cloud
bank
or
yield
slightest
color
to
the
scene
it
was
all
gray
gloomy
mysterious
a
narrow
stretch
of
water
disappearing
so
suddenly
the
eye
could
not
determine
ocean
from
sky
the
upper
masts
vanished
into
the
vapor
and
from
where
i
stood
aft
i
could
but
dimly
perceive
the
open
deck
amidships
the
light
yet
burning
in
the
binnacle
was
hazy
and
dull
there
was
to
my
mind
a
threat
in
the
weather
expressed
in
the
silence
overhead
as
well
as
in
the
sullen
swell
underfoot
we
could
not
be
far
from
the
coast
a
coast
line
of
which
i
knew
next
to
nothing
and
at
any
instant
the
blinding
fog
encircling
us
might
be
swept
aside
by
some
sudden
atmospheric
change
catching
us
aback
and
leaving
us
helpless
upon
the
waters
again
and
again
i
had
witnessed
storms
burst
from
just
such
conditions
and
we
were
far
too
to
take
any
unnecessary
risk
i
talked
with
harwood
at
the
wheel
and
waited
occasionally
walking
over
to
the
rail
and
peering
out
into
the
mist
uneasily
it
seemed
to
me
the
heave
of
water
beneath
our
keel
grew
heavier
the
fog
more
dense
the
mystery
more
profound
safety
was
better
than
progress
particularly
as
there
was
no
real
object
any
longer
in
our
clinging
to
a
westerly
course
the
sensible
thing
was
to
lay
too
until
the
enveloping
fog
blew
away
explore
that
room
below
and
explain
my
plans
to
the
men
this
determined
upon
i
called
all
hands
and
with
watkins
in
command
forward
preceded
to
strip
the
vessel
of
canvas
leaving
exposed
only
a
jib
sheet
with
closely
reefed
foresail
barely
enough
to
give
the
wheelsman
control
this
required
some
time
and
compelled
me
to
lay
hold
with
the
others
and
when
the
last
gasket
had
been
secured
and
the
men
aloft
returned
to
the
deck
sam
had
the
galley
fire
burning
and
breakfast
nearly
ready
the
lads
saturated
with
moisture
and
in
anything
but
good
humor
were
soon
restored
to
cheerfulness
and
i
left
them
sitting
about
on
deck
and
returned
aft
where
dorothy
aroused
by
the
noise
stood
well
wrapped
up
near
the
rail
sleep
had
refreshed
her
greatly
her
eyes
welcoming
me
a
red
flush
on
either
cheek
have
you
been
up
all
night
yes
but
i
would
hardly
know
it
a
sleepless
night
means
nothing
to
a
sailor
but
it
was
so
selfish
of
me
to
sleep
all
those
hours
i
had
you
to
think
about
all
we
have
said
to
each
other
and
our
plans
what
are
they
you
have
determined
to
do
as
you
suggested
it
is
the
braver
and
i
believe
the
better
way
the
difficulty
is
going
to
lie
in
convincing
the
crew
of
their
safety
i
shall
explore
below
before
having
a
talk
with
them
in
hope
of
discovering
treasure
to
be
divided
yes
that
will
have
greater
weight
with
those
fellows
than
any
argument
or
promise
here
comes
sam
with
our
breakfast
we
will
eat
here
from
the
flag
locker
the
negro
served
us
with
some
skill
and
discovering
we
were
hungry
both
did
full
justice
to
the
fare
the
denseness
of
the
fog
hid
the
men
from
us
but
we
could
hear
their
voices
and
occasionally
a
burst
of
laughter
we
were
talking
quietly
together
and
had
nearly
finished
when
watkins
emerged
through
the
mist
and
approached
respectfully
you
did
not
like
the
look
o
things
sir
he
asked
staring
out
into
the
smother
astern
i
seen
storms
born
from
such
fogs
i
answered
and
know
nothing
of
this
coast
you
think
then
it
not
far
away
out
yonder
it
is
all
a
guess
we
made
good
progress
most
of
the
night
and
i
have
no
confidence
in
the
chart
there
are
headlands
hereabout
and
we
might
be
within
hail
of
one
at
this
minute
it
is
safer
to
lie
quiet
until
the
mist
lifts
by
the
way
watkins
ay
ay
sir
miss
fairfax
tells
me
that
was
a
storeroom
in
which
i
fought
the
ape
last
night
it
was
sir
and
she
reports
having
seen
a
chest
among
the
other
stuff
did
you
notice
it
he
walked
across
to
the
rail
spat
overboard
and
came
back
politely
wiping
his
lips
on
his
sleeve
yes
sir
i
did
it
was
stored
ter
starboard
an
sea
chest
padlocked
an
looked
like
a
relic
but
a
damned
strong
box
you
think
maybe
there
gold
in
it
likely
enough
i
found
about
five
hundred
pounds
in
the
room
but
there
must
be
more
aboard
unless
it
was
left
behind
in
cuba
my
idea
is
that
was
why
the
monkey
was
locked
up
in
there
to
guard
the
treasure
does
that
sound
reasonable
he
scratched
his
head
his
eyes
wandering
from
her
face
to
mine
yes
sir
it
does
i
heard
o
such
things
afore
a
chimpanzee
is
a
big
dog
on
such
a
job
thar
ai
no
sailor
who
would
tackle
the
beast
that
was
my
way
of
looking
at
it
so
while
we
are
lying
here
and
the
lads
are
in
good
humor
hear
that
laugh
i
am
going
to
find
out
in
the
chest
after
i
know
i
talk
to
the
men
do
you
agree
he
nodded
but
without
speaking
are
you
willing
to
go
below
with
me
i
ai
overly
anxious
it
mister
carlyle
he
replied
gruffly
plucking
awkwardly
at
the
peak
of
his
cap
i
a
seaman
sir
know
my
duty
an
so
i
go
if
yer
wus
ter
order
me
to
yer
know
that
but
i
ai
fergot
yet
this
yere
is
a
cholera
ship
it
goin
ter
be
as
black
as
night
down
thar
in
thet
cabin
do
urge
him
geoffry
the
girl
interrupted
her
hand
on
my
sleeve
leave
him
here
on
deck
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
and
all
you
need
is
someone
to
hold
the
light
please
let
me
do
that
i
looked
down
into
her
eyes
and
smiled
suppose
we
should
encounter
another
ape
then
i
would
want
to
be
with
you
she
responded
quickly
you
are
going
to
consent
i
suppose
i
am
although
if
there
was
the
slightest
danger
my
answer
would
be
otherwise
keep
the
men
busy
watkins
while
we
are
gone
do
give
them
time
to
ask
questions
you
brought
the
lantern
on
deck
yes
sir
it
over
there
against
the
grating
very
well
we
light
up
in
the
companion
so
the
flame
will
not
be
seen
by
the
crew
coming
dorothy
she
accompanied
me
cheerfully
but
her
hand
grasped
mine
as
we
groped
our
way
down
the
stairs
into
the
dark
cabin
a
faint
glimmer
of
gray
daylight
filtered
through
the
glass
from
above
and
found
entrance
at
the
open
ports
but
the
place
was
nevertheless
gloomy
enough
and
we
needed
what
little
help
the
candle
afforded
to
find
our
way
about
the
memories
haunted
us
both
and
hurried
us
to
our
special
mission
the
door
of
the
storeroom
stood
wide
open
but
the
after
ports
were
closed
the
air
within
heated
and
foul
dorothy
held
the
lantern
her
hands
trembling
slightly
as
i
stepped
across
and
unscrewed
both
ports
the
moist
fog
blew
in
upon
me
but
was
welcome
although
i
stared
forth
into
a
bank
of
impenetrable
mist
the
dead
ape
lay
just
as
he
had
fallen
with
his
hideous
face
upturned
and
a
great
gash
in
the
head
the
hatchet
with
which
i
had
dealt
the
blow
rested
on
the
deck
disfigured
with
blood
the
hugeness
of
the
creature
its
repulsive
aspect
in
death
with
savage
teeth
gleaming
in
the
rays
of
the
lantern
and
long
hairy
arms
outspread
gave
me
such
a
shock
i
felt
my
limbs
tremble
for
a
moment
i
could
not
remove
my
eyes
from
the
spectacle
or
regain
control
of
my
nerves
then
i
some
way
saw
the
horror
reflected
in
her
face
and
realized
the
requirements
of
leadership
he
was
certainly
a
big
brute
i
said
quietly
and
it
was
a
lucky
stroke
which
finished
him
now
to
complete
our
work
in
here
and
get
out
i
picked
up
the
hatchet
and
my
glance
sought
the
whereabouts
of
the
chest
the
light
was
confusing
and
she
stepped
forward
throwing
the
dim
yellow
flame
directly
upon
the
object
this
is
what
i
saw
see
does
it
look
like
a
treasure
chest
to
you
if
it
be
not
i
never
saw
one
and
a
hundred
years
old
if
it
is
a
day
what
a
story
of
the
sea
it
might
tell
if
it
had
a
tongue
there
is
no
way
to
find
its
secrets
but
to
break
it
open
place
the
lantern
on
this
cask
of
wine
now
if
i
can
gain
purchase
with
the
blade
it
will
be
easily
accomplished
it
proved
harder
than
i
had
believed
the
staple
of
the
lock
clinging
to
the
hard
teak
wood
of
which
the
chest
was
made
i
must
have
been
ten
minutes
at
it
compelled
to
use
a
wooden
bar
as
lever
before
it
yielded
groaning
as
it
finally
released
its
grip
like
a
soul
in
agony
i
felt
the
girl
clutch
me
in
terror
at
the
sound
her
frightened
eyes
searching
the
shadows
but
i
was
interested
by
then
to
learn
what
was
within
and
gave
all
my
effort
to
lifting
the
lid
this
was
heavy
as
though
weighted
with
lead
but
as
i
finally
forced
it
backward
a
hinge
snapped
and
permitted
it
to
drop
crashing
to
the
deck
for
an
instant
i
could
see
nothing
within
no
more
indeed
than
some
dimly
revealed
outline
the
nature
of
which
could
not
be
determined
yet
somehow
it
gave
me
an
impression
horrible
grotesque
of
a
human
form
i
gripped
the
side
of
the
chest
afraid
to
reach
downward
lift
up
the
lantern
dorothy
please
no
higher
than
that
what
in
god
name
why
it
is
the
corpse
of
a
woman
i
heard
her
cry
out
and
barely
caught
the
lantern
as
it
fell
from
her
hand
the
hatchet
struck
the
deck
with
a
sharp
clang
and
i
felt
the
frightened
clasp
of
the
girl
fingers
on
my
sleeve
yet
i
scarcely
realized
these
things
my
entire
attention
focussed
on
what
was
now
revealed
writhin
the
chest
at
first
i
doubted
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyes
snatching
the
bit
of
flaring
candle
from
its
tin
socket
and
holding
it
where
the
full
glare
of
light
fell
across
the
grewsome
object
ay
it
was
a
woman
with
lower
limbs
doubled
back
from
lack
of
space
but
otherwise
lying
as
though
she
slept
so
perfect
in
preservation
her
cheeks
appeared
flushed
with
health
her
lips
half
smiling
it
was
a
face
of
real
beauty
an
english
face
although
her
eyes
and
hair
were
dark
and
her
mantilla
and
long
earrings
were
unquestionably
spanish
a
string
of
pearls
encircled
her
throat
and
there
were
numerous
rings
upon
her
fingers
the
very
contrast
added
immeasurably
to
the
horror
she
is
alive
surely
she
is
alive
the
words
were
sobbed
into
my
ear
trembling
from
dorothy
lips
as
though
she
could
barely
utter
them
i
stared
into
her
face
the
sight
of
her
terror
arousing
me
from
stupor
alive
no
that
is
impossible
and
conquering
a
repugnance
such
as
i
had
never
before
experienced
i
touched
the
figure
with
my
hand
the
flesh
is
like
stone
i
said
thus
held
lifelike
by
some
magic
of
the
indies
i
have
heard
of
such
skill
but
never
before
realized
its
perfection
good
god
she
actually
seems
to
breathe
what
can
it
all
mean
who
could
the
woman
be
and
why
should
her
body
be
thus
carried
about
at
sea
is
it
love
or
hate
not
love
geoffry
love
would
never
do
this
thing
it
is
hate
the
gloating
of
revenge
there
can
be
no
other
answer
this
is
the
end
of
a
tragedy
the
truth
of
which
will
never
be
known
are
you
sure
is
there
nothing
hidden
with
her
in
there
to
tell
who
she
was
or
how
she
died
there
was
nothing
not
a
scrap
of
paper
not
even
the
semblance
of
a
wound
exposed
the
smile
on
those
parted
lips
had
become
one
of
mockery
i
could
bear
the
sight
no
longer
and
rose
to
my
feet
clasping
dorothy
close
to
me
as
she
still
gazed
down
in
fascination
at
the
ghastly
sight
we
will
never
know
the
man
who
could
tell
is
dead
captain
paradilla
who
else
could
it
be
this
was
his
schooner
and
here
he
alone
could
hide
such
a
secret
there
is
nothing
more
we
can
learn
and
the
horror
unnerves
me
hold
the
light
dear
while
i
replace
the
lid
of
the
chest
it
required
my
utmost
effort
to
accomplish
this
yet
i
succeeded
in
sliding
the
heavy
covering
back
inch
by
inch
until
it
fell
finally
into
place
i
was
glad
to
have
the
thing
hidden
to
escape
the
stare
of
those
fixed
eyes
the
death
smile
of
those
red
lips
it
was
no
longer
a
reality
but
a
dream
of
delirium
i
dare
not
think
or
speculate
my
only
desire
being
to
get
away
to
get
dorothy
away
my
eyes
swept
about
through
the
confusing
shadows
half
expecting
to
be
confronted
by
other
ghosts
of
the
past
but
all
they
encountered
were
the
indistinct
outlines
of
casks
and
boxes
and
the
hideous
hairy
figure
of
the
ape
outstretched
upon
the
deck
the
candle
fluttered
in
the
girl
shaking
hand
the
yellow
glare
forming
weird
reflections
ugly
shapes
along
the
wall
god
what
if
it
should
go
out
leaving
us
lost
and
groping
about
in
this
chamber
of
horrors
in
absolute
terror
i
drew
her
with
me
to
the
open
door
then
stopped
paralyzed
the
half
revealed
figure
of
a
man
appeared
on
the
cabin
stairs
stop
who
are
you
watkins
sir
i
came
below
to
call
you
there
sumthin
bloomin
odd
takin
place
out
there
in
the
fog
captain
carlyle
we
want

on
deck
sir
right
away
chapter
xxxi
the
boat
attack
he
waited
for
us
just
without
the
companion
but
my
eyes
caught
nothing
unusual
as
i
emerged
into
the
daylight
i
could
barely
see
amidships
but
thus
far
the
deck
was
clear
and
on
either
side
hung
the
impenetrable
bank
of
cloud
leaving
sea
and
sky
invisible
simmes
was
at
the
wheel
with
no
other
member
of
the
crew
in
sight
what
is
it
watkins
where
are
the
men
forrard
sir
a
hangin
over
the
starboard
rail
thar
cursedly
strange
a
happenin
in
that
damn
fog
harwood
was
the
first
ter
hear
the
clatter
ov
en
oar
slippin
in
a
rowlock
i
thought
the
feller
wus
crazy
till
i
heerd
sumthin
also
an
then
sir
while
we
wus
still
a
listenin
we
both
caught
sound
ov
a
spanish
oath
spoke
as
plain
as
if
the
buck
was
aboard
you
saw
nothing
not
so
much
as
a
shadder
sir
a
lost
boat
likely
sailors
adrift
in
the
fog
perhaps
our
other
no
one
hailed
them
no
sir
i
told
the
men
ter
keep
still
till
i
called
you
it
might
be
a
party
this
ai
no
coast
fer
any
honest
sailors
ter
be
huggin
up
to
an
i
did
like
that
feller
talkin
spanish
but
if
their
purpose
is
to
take
us
by
surprise
i
said
they
be
more
cautious
about
it
maybe
they
did
know
how
near
they
was
likely
they
kin
see
us
much
better
we
kin
see
them
the
sea
got
an
ugly
swell
to
it
an
the
feller
likely
cussed
afore
he
thought
enyhow
it
wa
my
place
ter
hail
all
right
where
are
they
straight
off
the
starboard
quarter
sir
the
crew
were
all
gathered
there
staring
out
into
the
mist
whispering
to
each
other
even
they
were
indistinct
their
faces
unrecognizable
until
i
pressed
my
way
in
among
them
i
brought
up
beside
harwood
hear
anything
more
not
yet
sir
peering
about
to
make
sure
of
who
spoke
but
a
boat
out
yonder
i
swear
to
that
how
far
away
when
you
heard
them
not
fifty
fathoms
an
maybe
not
that
the
voice
sounded
clearest
we
may
have
been
clinging
there
a
minute
or
two
breathlessly
listening
our
hands
tensely
gripping
the
rail
my
coming
had
silenced
the
others
and
we
waited
motionless
the
stillness
so
intense
i
could
hear
the
lapping
of
waves
against
the
side
and
the
slight
creak
of
a
rope
aloft
then
a
voice
spoke
directly
in
front
of
me
out
from
the
dense
fog
a
peculiar
penetrating
voice
carrying
farther
than
the
owner
probably
thought
and
distinctly
audible
try
the
port
oar
pedro
we
must
have
missed
the
damn
ship
i
straightened
up
as
though
struck
my
eyes
seeking
those
of
harwood
who
stared
back
at
me
his
mouth
wide
open
in
astonishment
you
heard
that
i
whispered
do
you
know
who
spoke
by
god
do
i
dead
or
alive
sir
it
was
manuel
estevan
ay
no
other
and
alive
enough
no
doubt
lads
come
close
to
me
and
listen
they
must
not
hear
us
out
there
by
some
devil
trick
the
has
followed
our
course
or
else
yonder
are
a
part
of
his
crew
cast
away
they
clearly
know
of
us
perhaps
had
a
glimpse
through
some
rift
in
the
cloud
and
are
seeking
to
board
with
a
boat
party
is
not
likely
those
devils
know
who
we
are
probably
take
us
for
a
merchant
ship
becalmed
in
the
fog
and
liable
to
become
an
easy
prey
if
they
can
only
slip
up
on
us
unseen
how
are
you
bullies
ready
to
battle
your
old
mates
those
were
no
mates
o
ours
sir
said
watkins
indignantly
they
are
mongrels
and
no
sailors
estevan
is
a
so
far
as
my
voice
goes
i
rather
die
on
this
deck
than
ever
agin
be
a
bloody
pirate
is
that
the
right
word
lads
the
others
grumbled
assent
but
their
muttered
words
had
in
them
a
ring
of
sincerity
and
their
faces
exhibited
no
cowardice
harwood
alone
asked
a
question
i
fer
fightin
sir
he
said
grimly
but
what
we
use
them
lads
ai
comin
aboard
but
damn
if
i
seed
a
weapon
on
this
hooker
dar
three
knives
an
a
meat
cleaver
in
der
galley
sah
chimed
in
sam
we
do
well
enough
some
of
you
have
your
sheath
knives
yet
and
the
rest
can
use
belaying
pins
and
capstan
bars
the
point
is
to
not
let
them
get
aboard
and
if
there
is
only
one
boat
we
will
be
pretty
pick
up
what
you
can
and
man
this
rail
quietly
now
hearties
and
keep
your
eyes
open
it
proved
a
longer
wait
than
i
expected
the
fog
gave
us
no
glimpse
of
the
surrounding
water
and
not
another
sound
enabled
us
to
locate
the
approaching
boat
i
felt
convinced
we
had
not
been
overheard
as
no
one
had
spoken
above
a
whisper
and
the
men
aboard
had
been
noiseless
in
their
movements
about
deck
i
had
compelled
dorothy
to
remain
on
the
port
side
of
the
cabin
removed
from
all
danger
and
the
only
upright
figure
in
sight
was
the
man
at
the
wheel
the
rest
of
us
crouched
along
the
starboard
rail
peering
out
into
the
mist
and
listening
for
the
slightest
sound
they
were
a
motley
crew
armed
with
every
conceivable
sort
of
knife
or
war
club
but
sturdy
fellows
ready
and
willing
enough
to
give
a
good
account
of
themselves
watkins
was
forward
swallowed
up
in
the
smother
of
mist
but
schmitt
held
a
place
next
me
a
huge
ungainly
figure
in
the
dull
light
so
still
it
was
i
began
to
doubt
having
heard
the
voice
at
all
could
it
have
been
imagination
but
no
that
was
impossible
for
the
sound
had
reached
all
of
us
alike
somewhere
out
yonder
that
boat
was
creeping
along
silently
seeking
blindly
through
the
fog
to
reach
our
side
unobserved
those
wolves
of
the
sea
had
the
scent
i
do
not
know
how
long
the
suspense
lasted
but
i
have
never
felt
a
greater
strain
on
my
nerves
every
deeper
shadow
increased
the
tension
imagination
playing
strange
tricks
as
i
stared
fixedly
into
the
void
and
trembled
at
the
slightest
sound
once
i
was
sure
i
heard
the
splash
of
an
oar
but
no
one
on
deck
spoke
and
i
remained
silent
the
faint
creaking
of
a
rope
aloft
caused
my
heart
to
thump
and
when
a
loosened
edge
of
canvas
slapped
the
mast
in
a
sudden
breath
of
air
it
sounded
to
me
like
a
burst
of
thunder
where
were
the
fellows
had
they
abandoned
their
search
confused
by
the
fog
or
were
they
still
stealthily
seeking
to
locate
our
position
could
there
be
more
than
one
boat
and
if
not
what
force
of
men
might
such
a
boat
contain
these
questions
never
left
me
and
were
alike
unanswerable
unable
to
withstand
inaction
any
longer
i
arose
to
my
feet
thinking
to
pass
down
the
line
with
a
word
of
encouragement
to
each
man
a
glance
upward
told
me
the
heavy
mist
was
passing
driven
away
by
a
light
breeze
from
the
south
through
the
thick
curtain
which
still
clung
to
the
deck
i
could
perceive
the
upper
spars
already
tipped
with
sunlight
and
edges
of
reefed
canvas
flapping
in
the
wind
the
schooner
felt
the
impulse
the
bow
swinging
sharply
to
port
and
i
turned
and
took
a
few
steps
aft
thinking
to
gauge
our
progress
by
the
wake
astern
i
was
abaft
the
cabin
on
the
port
side
when
dorothy
called
my
name
a
sudden
accent
of
terror
in
her
voice
the
alarm
was
sounded
none
too
soon
either
fortune
or
skill
had
served
those
demons
well
gliding
silently
through
the
obscuring
cloud
hanging
in
dense
folds
of
vapor
to
the
water
surface
propelled
and
guided
by
a
single
oar
used
cautiously
as
a
paddle
they
had
succeeded
in
circling
the
stern
of
the
unseen
and
unheard
by
anyone
aboard
not
even
the
girl
unconscious
of
the
possibility
of
approaching
danger
from
that
quarter
her
attention
diverted
elsewhere
had
her
slightest
suspicion
aroused
as
they
glided
noiselessly
alongside
and
made
fast
beneath
the
protection
of
the
one
by
one
moving
like
snakes
the
devils
passed
inboard
to
where
they
could
survey
the
seemingly
deserted
deck
some
slight
noise
awoke
her
to
their
presence
yet
even
as
she
shrieked
the
sudden
alarm
a
hand
was
at
her
throat
and
she
was
struggling
desperately
in
the
merciless
grip
of
a
indian
yet
at
that
they
were
too
late
the
advantage
of
surprise
had
failed
them
a
half
dozen
had
reached
the
deck
leaping
from
the
rail
the
others
below
clambering
after
their
leaders
when
with
a
rush
we
met
them
it
was
a
fierce
mad
fight
fist
and
club
pitted
against
knife
and
cutlass
but
the
defenders
knowing
well
the
odds
against
them
angered
by
the
plight
of
the
girl
realizing
that
death
would
be
the
reward
of
defeat
struck
like
demons
incarnate
crushing
their
astounded
antagonists
back
against
the
bulwark
i
doubt
if
the
struggle
lasted
two
minutes
and
my
memory
of
the
scene
is
but
a
series
of
flashes
i
heard
the
blows
the
oaths
the
cries
of
pain
the
dull
thud
of
wood
against
bone
the
sharp
clang
of
steel
in
contact
the
shuffling
of
feet
on
the
deck
the
splash
of
bodies
hurled
overboard
these
sounds
mingle
in
my
mind
with
the
flash
of
weapons
the
glare
of
infuriated
eyes
the
dark
savage
faces
yet
it
was
all
confusion
uproar
mingling
of
bodies
and
hoarse
shouts
each
man
fought
for
himself
in
his
own
way
i
thought
only
of
her
and
leaped
straight
for
her
assailant
with
bare
hands
smashing
recklessly
through
the
hasty
guard
of
his
cutlass
ignorant
that
he
had
even
struck
me
and
gripped
the
copper
devil
by
hair
and
throat
i
knew
she
fell
to
the
deck
beneath
our
feet
but
i
had
my
work
cut
out
for
me
he
was
a
slippery
as
an
eel
in
his
half
nakedness
strong
as
an
ox
and
fighting
like
a
fiend
but
for
that
first
lucky
grip
i
doubt
my
killing
him
yet
i
had
him
foul
my
grip
unbreakable
as
i
jerked
and
forced
his
neck
back
against
the
rail
until
it
cracked
the
swarthy
body
sliding
inert
to
the
deck
whirling
to
assist
the
others
assured
of
the
fellow
helplessness
i
found
no
need
except
for
bodies
here
and
there
the
deck
was
clear
men
were
struggling
in
the
chains
two
below
in
the
boat
were
endeavoring
to
cast
off
and
schmitt
with
estevan
helpless
in
his
arms
staggered
to
the
side
and
flung
the
shrieking
spanish
cur
overboard
out
into
the
dark
water
i
heard
the
splash
as
he
fell
the
single
cry
his
lips
gave
but
he
never
again
appeared
above
the
surface
above
the
bedlam
watkins
roared
out
an
order
that
it
bullies
that
it
now
let
her
drop
we
send
them
to
hell
where
they
belong
good
shot
she
landed
it
was
the
hank
of
a
spare
anchor
balanced
for
an
instant
on
the
rail
then
sent
crashing
down
through
the
frail
bottom
of
the
boat
beneath
the
wreck
drifted
away
into
the
fog
the
two
miserable
occupants
clinging
desperately
to
the
gunwales
i
lifted
dorothy
to
her
feet
and
she
clung
to
me
unsteadily
her
face
yet
white
is
it
all
over
have
they
been
driven
off
yes
there
is
nothing
more
to
fear
from
them
were
you
injured
not
not
seriously
he
hurt
me
terribly
but
made
no
attempt
to
use
his
cutlass
i
i
guess
i
was
more
frightened
than
anything
else
is
is
the
man
dead
if
not
he
might
as
well
be
i
answered
glancing
at
the
body
but
not
caring
to
explain
it
was
no
time
for
mercy
when
i
got
to
him
watkins
ay
ay
sir
have
you
figured
up
results
not
fully
sir
two
of
our
men
are
cut
rather
badly
and
cole
come
too
yet
from
a
smart
rap
on
the
head
none
got
away
he
grinned
cheerfully
not
they
swum
thar
six
dead
ones
aboard
four
took
ter
the
water
mostly
because
they
hed
too
the
only
livin
one
o
the
bunch
is
thet
nigger
the
wheel
an
nuthin
but
a
thick
skull
saved
him
then
there
were
eleven
in
the
party
what
do
you
suppose
has
become
of
the
others
aboard
the
he
shook
his
head
puzzled
by
the
question
i
dunno
sir
they
might
be
a
waitin
out
there
in
the
fog
perhaps
the
nigger
cud
tell
you
i
crossed
over
to
where
the
fellow
sat
on
a
grating
his
head
in
his
hands
the
girl
still
clinging
to
my
sleeve
as
though
fearful
of
being
left
alone
the
man
was
a
repulsive
brute
his
face
stained
with
blood
dripping
from
a
cut
across
his
low
forehead
he
looked
up
sullenly
at
our
approach
but
made
no
effort
to
rise
what
your
name
my
man
i
asked
in
spanish
jose
mendez
senor
you
were
aboard
the
he
growled
out
an
answer
which
i
interpreted
to
signify
assent
but
watkins
lost
his
temper
look
yere
you
black
villain
he
roared
driving
the
lesson
home
with
his
boot
do
be
a
playin
possum
yer
stand
up
an
answer
mister
carlyle
or
yer
git
a
worse
clip
than
i
give
yer
afore
whar
is
the
bloody
bark
pounding
her
heart
out
on
the
rocks
yonder
he
said
more
civilly
unless
she
slid
off
an
gone
down
wrecked
where
hell
i
ai
sure
what
west
frum
here
off
our
port
quarter
then
that
where
she
is
maybe
a
mile
er
so
what
about
the
crew
they
got
away
in
the
boats
an
likely
mostly
are
ashore
we
were
in
the
last
boat
launched
an
headed
out
so
far
ter
get
a
ledge
o
rocks
we
got
lost
in
the
fog
then
the
mist
sorter
opened
give
us
a
glimpse
o
yer
topsails
manuel
was
for
boarding
you
right
away
and
the
rest
of
us
talked
it
over
and
thought
it
would
be
all
right
we
did
expect
no
fight
once
we
got
aboard
expected
to
find
something
easy
of
course
perhaps
it
would
have
been
if
you
fellows
in
the
boat
had
held
your
tongues
by
any
chance
do
you
know
now
who
we
are
he
rolled
his
eyes
toward
watkins
and
then
at
schmitt
engaged
in
some
job
across
the
deck
those
two
used
to
be
on
the
he
said
his
tone
again
sullen
are
you
the
fellers
who
locked
us
in
between
decks
we
are
the
ones
jose
you
were
up
against
fighting
men
when
you
came
in
over
our
rail
what
is
it
you
see
out
there
harwood
the
seaman
who
was
standing
with
hollowed
hands
shading
his
eyes
staring
forth
into
the
swirling
drapery
of
fog
turned
at
my
call
and
pointed
excitedly
there
a
bark
aground
yonder
sir
and
by
god
it
looks
like
the
even
as
i
crossed
the
deck
to
his
side
eagerly
searching
the
direction
indicated
the
wreaths
of
obscuring
mist
seemed
to
divide
as
though
swept
apart
by
some
mighty
hand
and
there
in
the
full
glow
of
the
sun
a
picture
in
a
frame
lay
the
wrecked
vessel
others
saw
it
as
i
did
and
a
chorus
of
voices
gave
vent
to
recognition
damned
if
it
ai
the
old
hooker
she
got
what
was
coming
to
her
all
right
mates
maybe
that
ai
hell
bullies
and
she
lousy
with
treasure
come
here
sam
that
the
last
of
the
chapter
xxxii
the
last
of
the
namur
even
from
where
we
were
looking
across
that
stretch
of
water
yet
obscured
by
floating
patches
of
mist
the
vessel
was
plainly
a
total
wreck
rapidly
pounding
to
death
on
a
sharp
ledge
of
rock
both
masts
were
down
and
lifted
as
the
bow
was
it
was
easy
to
perceive
the
deck
was
in
splinters
where
falling
spars
and
topmasts
had
crashed
their
way
through
she
must
have
struck
the
ledge
at
good
speed
and
with
all
sail
set
for
the
canvas
was
overside
with
much
of
the
a
horrible
mess
tossed
about
in
the
breakers
broken
ends
of
spars
viciously
pounding
against
the
ship
side
the
bows
had
caught
seemingly
jammed
in
between
rocks
the
stern
sunk
deep
with
cabin
port
holes
barely
above
reach
of
the
waves
it
seemed
probable
that
any
minute
the
whole
helpless
mass
might
slide
backward
into
the
water
and
be
swept
away
not
a
living
thing
appeared
on
board
and
as
the
fog
slowly
drifted
away
my
eyes
could
discern
no
sign
of
any
boat
no
evidence
of
the
crew
along
the
wide
sweep
of
water
little
by
little
as
the
vista
widened
and
we
still
remained
watching
the
miserable
wreck
as
though
fascinated
we
were
able
to
distinguish
the
dark
line
of
coast
to
the
westward
and
to
determine
that
the
unfortunate
had
struck
at
the
extremity
of
a
headland
whose
rocky
front
had
pushed
its
way
far
out
to
sea
a
voice
not
far
distant
aroused
me
what
was
it
you
said
jack
treasure
on
the
old
hooker
hell
if
it
there
why
not
get
it
afore
it
too
late
it
thar
all
right
ole
and
i
knew
the
speaker
to
be
haines
ai
it
mr
carlyle
yes
lads
there
must
be
money
on
board
unless
those
fellows
took
it
with
them
in
the
boats
i
know
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
stolen
in
virginia
and
no
doubt
there
is
more
than
that
perhaps
they
took
the
swag
along
with
sir
that
would
be
the
way
i
figure
it
broke
in
watkins
that
nigger
says
the
boat
what
attacked
us
was
the
last
one
ter
git
away
an
thar
no
chest
in
her
if
manuel
did
stay
aboard
long
ter
git
his
fingers
outer
thet
gold
none
ov
the
others
did
they
wus
so
damned
anxious
to
save
their
lives
they
never
thought
ov
nuthin
else
sir
but
maybe
they
think
about
that
later
an
cum
back
insisted
haines
pressing
forward
ai
that
right
sir
right
enough
only
they
will
not
have
much
time
to
think
it
over
from
the
look
of
things
out
there
i
answered
the
bark
is
liable
to
slide
off
that
rock
any
minute
and
go
down
like
a
stone
what
do
you
say
bullies
here
is
a
risky
job
but
a
pocket
full
of
gold
pieces
if
we
can
get
aboard
and
safely
off
again
who
go
across
with
me
there
was
a
babel
of
voices
the
men
crowding
about
me
all
else
forgotten
as
the
lust
of
greed
gripped
their
imaginations
stand
back
lads
i
can
not
use
all
of
you
four
will
be
enough
i
choose
haines
harwood
ole
hallin
and
pierre
lower
that
starboard
you
four
and
see
to
the
plugs
and
oars
no
watkins
i
want
you
to
remain
in
charge
here
there
is
plenty
to
do
get
those
bodies
overboard
first
and
clean
up
this
litter
then
shake
out
the
reef
in
the
foresail
and
stand
by
there
is
wind
coming
from
that
cloud
yonder
and
no
time
to
waste
you
not
lose
anything
of
what
we
bring
back
it
be
share
and
share
alike
so
fall
too
hearties
shall
we
lower
away
sir
ay
if
all
is
fast
i
be
with
you
in
a
minute
get
aboard
ole
and
ward
her
off
with
a
boat
hook
easy
now
till
she
takes
water
i
paused
an
instant
to
speak
to
dorothy
seated
on
the
flag
locker
explaining
to
her
swiftly
my
object
in
exploring
the
wreck
and
pledging
myself
not
to
be
reckless
in
attempting
to
board
i
read
fear
in
her
eyes
yet
she
said
nothing
to
dissuade
me
and
our
hands
clasped
as
i
led
her
to
the
side
where
she
could
look
down
at
the
cockleshell
tossing
below
it
will
mean
much
if
we
can
recover
this
pirate
hoard
i
whispered
freedom
and
a
full
pardon
i
hope
yes
i
know
geoffry
but
do
not
venture
too
much
you
are
more
to
me
than
all
the
gold
in
the
world
i
shall
not
forget
sweetheart
the
sky
and
sea
are
almost
clear
now
and
you
can
watch
us
from
here
in
a
short
time
we
shall
be
safely
back
again
i
slipped
down
a
rope
and
dropped
into
the
boat
taking
my
place
with
a
steering
oar
at
the
stern
and
we
shot
away
through
the
green
water
the
men
yet
lined
the
rail
watching
us
enviously
although
watkins
voice
began
roaring
out
orders
dorothy
wraved
her
hand
which
i
acknowledged
by
lifting
my
cap
the
schooner
with
her
sharp
cutwater
and
graceful
proportions
made
so
fair
a
sea
picture
outlined
against
the
blue
haze
i
found
it
difficult
to
remove
my
gaze
but
finally
my
thought
concentrated
on
the
work
ahead
and
i
turned
to
urge
the
oarsmen
to
a
quicker
stroke
the
distance
was
greater
than
i
had
supposed
it
to
be
from
the
deck
of
the
nor
did
the
dark
cloud
slowly
poking
up
above
the
sea
to
the
southeast
ease
my
anxiety
to
get
this
task
over
with
before
a
storm
broke
the
proved
to
be
a
more
complete
wreck
than
our
distant
view
had
revealed
and
lying
in
a
more
precarious
position
while
the
sea
was
not
high
or
dangerous
beyond
the
headland
the
charging
billows
there
broke
in
foam
and
were
already
playing
havoc
with
the
stranded
vessel
smashing
great
spars
entangled
amid
canvas
and
cordage
about
so
as
to
render
our
approach
extremely
perilous
we
were
some
time
seeking
a
place
where
we
might
make
fast
but
finally
nosed
our
way
in
behind
the
shelter
of
a
huge
boom
held
steady
by
a
splinter
of
rock
until
harwood
got
the
hank
of
his
boat
hook
in
the
and
hung
on
it
was
no
pleasant
job
getting
aboard
but
ordering
haines
to
accompany
me
and
the
others
to
lie
by
in
the
lee
of
the
boom
i
made
use
of
a
dangling
backstay
and
thus
hauled
myself
up
to
a
reasonably
secure
footing
the
fellow
joined
me
breathless
and
together
we
perched
on
the
rail
to
gain
view
of
the
deck
it
was
a
distressing
hopeless
sight
the
vessel
rising
before
us
like
the
roof
of
a
house
the
deck
planks
stove
in
a
horrible
jumble
of
running
rigging
booms
and
spars
blocking
the
way
forward
aft
it
was
clearer
the
of
the
after
mast
having
fallen
overboard
smashing
a
small
boat
as
it
fell
but
leaving
the
deck
space
free
there
were
three
bodies
tangled
in
the
wreckage
within
our
sight
crushed
out
of
all
human
resemblance
and
the
face
of
a
negro
caught
beneath
the
ruins
of
the
galley
seemed
to
grin
back
at
me
in
death
every
timber
groaned
as
the
waves
struck
and
rocked
the
sodden
mass
and
i
had
no
doubt
but
that
the
vessel
had
already
broken
in
two
i
heard
haines
utter
an
oath
by
god
sir
did
you
ever
see
the
like
she
ca
hang
on
here
not
long
surely
i
admitted
a
bit
more
sea
and
she
breaks
into
kindling
wood
if
there
is
any
salvage
aboard
my
man
it
will
be
done
in
the
next
twenty
minutes
there
is
no
hope
o
gittin
forrard
sir
look
at
that
damn
litter
an
an
them
dead
men
it
is
forward
we
need
to
go
haines
it
aft
into
the
cabin
and
that
seems
a
clear
enough
passage
only
the
water
down
there
may
be
too
deep
let
make
a
try
of
it
he
was
evidently
reluctant
but
sailor
enough
to
follow
as
i
lowered
myself
to
the
deck
clinging
hard
to
keep
my
footing
on
the
wet
incline
a
light
spar
had
lodged
here
and
by
making
this
a
species
of
bridge
we
crept
as
far
as
the
companion
the
door
of
which
was
open
and
gained
view
of
the
scene
below
the
light
was
sufficient
to
reveal
most
of
the
interior
from
the
confusion
and
dampness
the
entire
cabin
had
evidently
been
deluged
with
water
but
this
had
largely
drained
away
leaving
a
mass
of
wreckage
behind
and
a
foot
or
two
still
slushing
about
the
doors
of
the
after
staterooms
it
was
a
dismal
hole
in
the
dim
light
more
like
a
cave
than
the
former
habitation
of
men
but
presented
no
obstacle
to
our
entrance
and
i
led
the
way
down
the
stairs
gripping
the
rail
to
keep
from
falling
haines
swore
as
he
followed
and
his
continual
growling
got
upon
my
nerves
stop
that
infernal
noise
i
ordered
shortly
looking
him
savagely
in
the
face
i
had
enough
of
it
you
were
wild
to
come
on
this
job
now
do
your
work
like
a
man
try
that
room
door
over
there
slide
down
you
fool
the
water
is
deep
wait
a
minute
now
give
me
a
hand
is
the
gold
in
here
sir
he
asked
with
interest
more
than
likely
this
was
the
captain
room
see
if
it
was
left
locked
the
door
gave
but
it
required
our
combined
efforts
to
press
it
open
against
the
volume
of
water
slushing
about
within
while
the
stern
port
was
yet
slightly
above
the
sea
level
the
crest
of
breaking
waves
obscured
the
glass
leaving
the
interior
darker
than
the
outer
cabin
for
a
moment
my
eyes
could
scarcely
recognize
the
various
objects
as
i
clung
to
the
frame
of
the
door
and
stared
blindly
about
in
the
gloom
then
slowly
they
assumed
shape
and
substance
screwed
to
the
deck
the
furniture
retained
its
place
but
everything
else
was
jammed
in
a
mass
of
wreckage
or
else
floating
about
in
a
foot
of
water
deepening
toward
the
stern
there
were
two
chests
in
the
room
one
of
which
i
instantly
recognized
as
that
of
roger
fairfax
the
sight
of
this
made
me
oblivious
to
all
else
urged
on
as
i
was
by
a
desire
to
escape
from
the
doomed
wreck
as
soon
as
possible
there
the
chest
we
want
haines
i
cried
pointing
it
out
have
the
lads
back
the
boat
up
to
this
port
then
come
down
and
help
me
handle
it
he
did
not
answer
or
move
and
i
whirled
about
angrily
what
is
the
matter
with
you
did
you
hear
what
i
said
yes
sir
his
voice
trembling
but
but
is
that
a
man
over
there
in
the
bunk
good
god
sir
look
at
him
the
white
ghastly
face
stared
at
us
looking
like
nothing
human
in
that
awful
twilight
i
actually
thought
it
a
ghost
until
with
desperate
effort
the
man
lifted
himself
clinging
with
gaunt
fingers
to
the
edge
of
the
bunk
then
i
knew
sanchez
you
those
damn
cowards
left
you
here
to
die
no
one
came
for
me
he
answered
choking
so
the
words
were
scarcely
intelligible
is
that
what
has
happened
the
bark
is
wrecked
the
crew
gone
yes
they
took
to
the
boats
manuel
with
them
manuel
his
enunciation
clearer
from
passion
the
sneaking
cur
but
i
can
not
see
your
face
who
are
you
and
what
brought
you
here
i
tell
you
frankly
captain
sanchez
and
i
stepped
closer
we
risked
coming
aboard
to
save
that
chest
roger
chest
before
it
went
down
this
vessel
has
its
back
broken
and
may
slide
off
into
deep
water
at
any
minute
we
must
get
you
out
of
here
first
get
me
out
he
laughed
hideously
you
pretend
to
place
my
safety
ahead
of
that
treasure
to
hell
with
your
help
i
want
none
of
it
i
am
a
dead
man
now
and
the
easiest
way
to
end
all
will
be
to
go
down
with
the
ship
be
a
fit
coffin
for
black
sanchez
by
god
i
know
you
now
geoffry
carlyle
yes
but
an
enemy
no
longer
that
is
for
me
to
say
i
hate
your
race
your
breed
your
cursed
english
strain
the
very
sound
of
your
name
drives
me
mad
i
accept
no
rescue
from
you
damn
you
take
your
gold
and
go
but
why
i
insisted
shocked
at
the
man
violence
i
have
done
you
no
is
it
because
i
interfered
between
you
and
dorothy
fairfax
he
laughed
again
the
sound
so
insane
haines
gripped
my
sleeve
in
terror
that
chit
bah
what
do
i
care
for
her
but
as
a
plaything
no
my
hate
runs
deeper
than
that
how
came
you
here
in
the
boat
stolen
from
the
no
captain
sanchez
the
day
after
we
left
the
ship
we
boarded
a
schooner
found
adrift
the
crew
stricken
with
cholera
with
not
a
man
left
alive
on
deck
or
below
she
lies
yonder
now
a
schooner
what
name
the
a
slaver
merciful
god
and
his
eyes
fairly
blazed
into
mine
as
he
suddenly
forced
his
body
upward
in
the
bunk
the
adrift
the
crew
dead
from
cholera
and
the
captain
paradilla
francis
paradilla
what
of
him
he
lay
alone
on
a
divan
in
the
cabin
dead
also
he
tried
to
speak
but
failed
his
fingers
clawing
at
his
throat
when
he
finally
gained
utterance
once
more
it
was
but
a
whisper
tell
me
he
begged
there
was
no
woman
with
him
i
stared
back
into
the
wild
insanity
of
his
eyes
trying
to
test
my
words
suddenly
aware
that
we
were
upon
the
edge
of
tragedy
perhaps
uncovering
the
hidden
secret
of
this
man
life
there
was
no
woman
i
said
gravely
on
deck
or
in
the
cabin
what
mean
you
by
saying
that
there
was
one
on
board
do
lie
to
me
in
an
hour
i
am
dead
but
first
tell
me
the
truth
does
the
woman
live
no
she
died
before
we
found
her
body
in
a
chest
preserved
by
some
devilish
indian
art
richly
dressed
and
decked
with
jewels
english
i
judged
her
so
but
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
you
knew
her
in
the
name
of
all
the
fiends
yes
and
i
know
her
end
he
killed
her
paradilla
killed
her
because
she
was
as
false
to
him
as
she
had
been
to
me
hell
but
it
is
strange
you
should
be
the
one
to
find
her
to
bring
me
this
tale
geoffry
carlyle
why
what
is
it
to
me
because
she
is
of
your
line
do
you
know
her
now
no
nor
believe
it
true
then
i
will
make
you
is
naught
to
me
anymore
for
i
am
dead
within
the
hour
you
go
back
to
england
and
tell
him
tell
the
duke
of
bucclough
how
his
precious
sister
died
his
sister
good
god
you
can
not
mean
that
woman
was
lady
sara
carlyle
who
should
know
better
than
i
sneeringly
once
i
was
called
in
england
sir
john
collinswood
he
sank
back
exhausted
struggling
for
breath
but
with
eyes
glowing
hatred
i
knew
it
all
now
the
dimly
remembered
story
coming
vividly
back
to
memory
here
then
was
the
ending
of
the
one
black
stain
on
the
family
honor
of
our
race
on
this
strange
coast
three
thousand
miles
from
its
beginning
the
final
curtain
was
being
rung
down
the
drama
finished
the
story
had
come
to
me
in
whispers
from
others
never
even
spoken
about
by
those
of
our
race
a
wild
headstrong
girl
a
secret
marriage
a
duel
in
the
park
her
brother
desperately
wounded
and
then
the
disappearance
of
the
pair
ten
days
later
it
was
known
that
sir
john
collinswood
had
defaulted
in
a
large
sum
but
from
that
hour
england
knew
him
no
more
as
though
the
sea
had
swallowed
them
both
man
and
woman
disappeared
leaving
no
trace
behind
the
face
i
gazed
dumbly
into
was
drawn
and
white
with
pain
yet
the
thin
lips
grinned
back
at
me
in
savage
derision
you
remember
i
see
he
snarled
then
to
hell
with
you
out
of
here
geoffry
carlyle
leave
me
to
die
in
peace
the
gold
is
there
take
it
and
my
curse
upon
it
hurry
now
do
you
hear
the
bark
grate
on
the
rocks
it
near
the
end
chapter
xxxiii
before
the
governor
the
sound
startled
me
i
imagined
i
heard
the
keel
slipping
yet
before
we
had
reached
the
door
opening
on
deck
the
slight
movement
ceased
my
hand
gripped
the
frightened
haines
tell
them
in
the
boat
to
do
as
i
said
then
come
back
here
my
god
sir
she
a
goin
down
not
for
some
minutes
yet
there
are
thousands
of
pounds
in
that
chest
you
risked
life
for
less
many
a
time
jump
my
man
the
boat
lay
in
close
bobbing
up
and
down
dangerously
yet
held
firmly
beneath
the
opened
port
pierre
warped
her
in
with
a
end
leaving
the
other
two
free
to
receive
the
box
as
we
cautiously
passed
it
out
within
grasp
of
their
hands
it
was
heavy
enough
to
tax
the
strength
of
two
men
to
handle
it
but
of
a
size
and
shape
permitting
its
passage
sanchez
had
raised
himself
again
and
clung
there
to
the
edge
of
the
bunk
watching
us
even
in
the
darkness
caused
by
the
chest
obscuring
the
port
i
felt
the
insane
glare
of
his
eyes
fastened
upon
me
once
he
attempted
to
speak
but
his
voice
failed
him
now
let
down
easy
lads
i
called
no
place
it
amidships
get
it
even
or
you
go
over
wrap
your
line
about
the
thwart
pierre
and
take
a
hand
ay
that
better
watch
out
now
we
drop
this
end
lord
but
i
thought
it
was
gone
fix
it
to
ride
steady
and
stand
by
we
pass
a
wounded
man
out
to
you
i
stepped
across
to
sanchez
slushing
through
the
water
and
barely
able
to
keep
my
feet
no
matter
who
the
brute
was
he
could
not
be
left
there
to
die
like
a
rat
alone
willingly
or
not
the
fellow
must
be
removed
before
the
bark
went
down
he
saw
me
coming
and
drew
back
his
ghastly
face
like
a
mask
no
you
do
damn
you
carlyle
he
snapped
angrily
keep
your
hands
off
me
so
you
want
me
to
die
with
my
neck
in
a
noose
do
you
well
you
never
see
that
sight
i
was
born
a
gentleman
and
by
god
i
die
like
one
and
go
down
with
my
ship
get
out
of
here
now
both
of
you
you
wo
hell
fire
but
you
will
or
else
die
here
with
me
i
give
you
a
minute
to
make
your
choice
he
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
meaning
his
purpose
from
somewhere
beneath
the
blanket
the
long
black
muzzle
of
a
pistol
looked
straight
into
my
eyes
the
hand
holding
it
was
firm
the
face
fronting
me
savagely
sardonic
i
like
to
kill
you
carlyle
he
hissed
hatefully
by
god
i
know
why
i
should
the
devils
in
hell
would
laugh
if
i
did
so
do
tempt
me
too
far
get
out
of
here
damn
you
every
time
i
look
at
you
i
see
her
face
if
you
take
a
step
nearer
i
pull
the
trigger
go
i
heard
haines
scrambling
back
up
the
sharp
incline
of
deck
and
realized
the
utter
uselessness
of
attempting
to
remain
any
instant
might
be
our
last
the
man
crazed
and
probably
dying
would
kill
me
gladly
he
had
chosen
his
fate
what
was
it
to
me
i
turned
and
worked
my
way
upward
to
the
companion
steps
half
expecting
every
instant
to
be
struck
by
a
bullet
from
behind
at
the
door
i
paused
to
glance
below
through
the
i
could
see
his
eyes
glaring
at
me
like
those
of
a
wild
beast
you
refuse
still
to
let
me
aid
you
sanchez
to
hell
with
you
leave
me
alone
it
was
a
hard
pull
back
to
the
for
the
sea
had
grown
noticeably
heavier
while
the
weight
of
the
chest
sank
the
boat
so
deeply
in
the
water
as
to
retard
progress
and
keep
one
man
bailing
the
cloud
in
the
southwest
had
already
assumed
threatening
proportions
and
i
urged
the
oarsmen
to
greater
exertions
anxious
to
get
aboard
before
the
coming
storm
broke
it
was
hard
to
keep
my
gaze
from
the
doomed
but
i
could
detect
no
change
in
her
position
as
we
drew
in
toward
the
waiting
schooner
harwood
alone
questioned
me
and
i
told
him
briefly
what
had
occurred
within
the
cabin
and
his
comment
seemed
to
voice
the
sentiment
of
the
others
he
made
a
bloomin
good
choice
sir
that
how
the
ol
devil
ought
ter
die
the
same
way
he
sent
many
another
it
beats
hangin
at
that
dorothy
greeted
me
first
and
we
stood
close
together
at
the
rail
as
the
men
hoisted
the
chest
on
deck
and
then
fastened
the
tackle
to
the
boat
she
said
nothing
asked
nothing
but
her
hands
clung
to
my
arm
and
whenever
i
turned
toward
her
our
eyes
met
i
did
not
find
the
courage
to
tell
her
then
what
we
had
found
aboard
the
although
i
could
not
prevent
my
own
eyes
from
wandering
constantly
toward
the
doomed
vessel
the
rising
sea
was
slapping
the
submerged
stern
with
increasing
violence
the
salt
spray
rising
in
clouds
over
the
after
rail
watkins
approached
us
coming
from
among
the
group
of
sailors
forward
there
a
smart
bit
of
wind
in
those
clouds
sir
he
said
respectfully
an
i
do
like
the
look
o
the
coast
ter
leeward
shall
we
trim
sail
not
quite
yet
watkins
it
will
be
some
time
before
the
gale
strikes
here
the
bark
is
going
down
presently
yes
sir
but
the
men
better
stand
by
he
glanced
from
my
face
to
that
of
the
girl
lowering
his
voice
harwood
tells
me
sanchez
was
aboard
sir
and
refused
to
leave
very
true
but
he
was
dying
no
doubt
is
dead
by
now
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
him
i
should
say
not
carlyle
i
would
lift
a
finger
ter
save
him
frum
hell
there
was
a
sudden
cry
forward
and
a
voice
shouted
there
she
goes
buckies
that
damn
dutchman
done
with
that
the
last
o
the
i
turned
swiftly
my
hand
grasping
her
fingers
as
they
clung
to
the
rail
with
a
rasping
sound
clearly
distinguished
across
the
intervening
water
as
though
every
timber
cried
out
in
agony
to
the
strain
the
battered
hulk
slid
downward
the
deck
breaking
amidships
as
the
stern
splashed
into
the
depths
then
that
also
toppled
over
leaving
nothing
above
water
except
the
blunt
end
of
a
broken
and
a
tangle
of
wreckage
tossed
about
on
the
crest
of
the
waves
i
watched
breathlessly
unable
to
utter
a
sound
i
could
only
think
of
that
stricken
man
in
the
cabin
those
wild
eyes
which
had
threatened
me
he
was
gone
now
gone
watkins
spoke
it
all
over
sir
yes
there
is
nothing
to
keep
us
here
any
longer
i
answered
still
dazed
but
realizing
i
must
arouse
myself
shake
out
the
reef
in
your
mainsail
and
we
get
out
to
sea
who
is
at
the
wheel
schmitt
sir
what
is
the
course
captain
carlyle
by
nor
and
hold
on
as
long
as
you
can
ay
ay
sir
by
nor
she
is
i
yet
held
dorothy
hand
tightly
clasped
in
my
own
and
the
depths
of
her
uplifted
eyes
questioned
me
we
will
go
aft
dear
and
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
i
said
gently
for
now
we
are
homeward
bound
i
write
these
few
closing
lines
a
year
later
in
the
cabin
of
the
a
three
master
full
to
the
hatches
with
a
cargo
of
tobacco
bound
for
london
and
a
market
dorothy
is
on
deck
eagerly
watching
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
chalk
cliffs
of
old
england
i
must
join
her
presently
yet
linger
below
to
add
these
final
sentences
there
is
after
all
little
which
needs
to
be
said
the
voyage
of
the
north
proved
uneventful
and
after
that
first
night
of
storm
the
weather
held
pleasant
and
the
sea
fairly
smooth
i
had
some
trouble
with
the
men
but
nothing
serious
as
watkins
and
harwood
held
as
i
did
and
the
pledge
of
dorothy
influence
brought
courage
i
refused
to
open
the
chest
believing
our
safety
and
chance
of
pardon
would
depend
largely
on
our
handing
this
over
in
good
faith
to
the
authorities
watkins
and
i
guarded
it
night
and
day
until
the
schooner
rounded
the
cape
and
came
into
the
chesapeake
no
attempt
was
made
to
find
quarters
below
the
entire
crew
sleeping
on
deck
dorothy
comfortable
on
the
flag
locker
it
was
scarcely
sunrise
on
the
fifth
day
when
we
dropped
anchor
against
the
current
of
the
james
our
sails
furled
and
the
red
english
colors
flying
from
the
peak
two
hours
later
the
entire
company
were
in
the
presence
of
the
governor
where
i
told
my
story
gravely
listened
to
supplemented
by
the
earnest
plea
of
the
young
woman
i
shall
never
forget
that
scene
or
how
breathlessly
we
awaited
the
decision
of
the
great
man
who
so
closely
watched
our
faces
they
were
surely
a
strange
rough
group
as
they
stood
thus
hats
in
hand
waiting
to
learn
their
fate
unshaven
largely
scum
of
the
sea
never
before
in
such
presence
shuffling
uneasily
before
his
glance
feeling
to
the
full
the
peril
of
their
position
their
eyes
turned
to
me
questioningly
opposite
us
behind
a
long
table
sat
the
governor
dignified
austere
his
hair
powdered
and
face
smoothly
shaven
while
on
either
side
of
him
were
those
of
his
council
many
of
the
faces
stern
and
unforgiving
but
for
their
gracious
reception
of
dorothy
and
their
careful
attention
to
her
words
i
should
have
lost
heart
they
questioned
me
shrewdly
although
the
governor
spoke
but
seldom
and
then
in
a
kindly
tone
of
sympathy
and
understanding
one
by
one
the
men
were
called
forward
each
in
turn
compelled
to
tell
briefly
the
story
of
his
life
and
when
all
was
done
the
eyes
of
the
governor
sought
those
of
his
council
you
have
all
alike
heard
the
tale
gentlemen
he
said
nothing
like
it
hath
ever
before
been
brought
before
this
colony
would
you
leave
decision
to
me
there
was
a
murmur
of
assent
as
though
they
were
thus
gladly
relieved
of
responsibility
in
so
serious
a
matter
the
governor
smiled
his
kindly
eyes
surveying
us
once
more
then
with
extended
hand
he
bade
dorothy
be
seated
the
story
is
seemingly
an
honest
one
he
said
slowly
and
these
seamen
have
done
a
great
service
to
the
colony
they
deserve
reward
rather
than
punishment
the
fair
lady
who
pleads
for
them
is
known
to
us
all
and
to
even
question
her
word
is
impossible
unfortunately
i
have
not
the
power
of
pardon
in
cases
of
piracy
nor
authority
to
free
bond
slaves
without
the
approval
of
the
home
government
yet
will
exercise
in
this
case
whatsoever
of
power
i
possess
for
gallant
services
rendered
to
the
colony
and
unselfish
devotion
to
mistress
dorothy
fairfax
i
release
geoffry
carlyle
from
servitude
pending
advices
from
england
i
also
grant
parole
to
these
seamen
on
condition
they
remain
within
our
jurisdiction
until
this
judgment
can
be
confirmed
and
full
pardons
issued
is
this
judgment
satisfactory
gentlemen
the
members
of
the
council
bowed
gravely
without
speaking
the
chest
of
treasure
recovered
from
the
sunken
pirate
ship
he
went
on
soberly
will
remain
unopened
until
final
decision
is
made
as
i
understand
master
carlyle
no
one
among
you
has
yet
seen
its
contents
or
estimated
its
value
no
your
excellency
beyond
doubt
it
contains
the
gold
stolen
from
roger
fairfax
and
possibly
the
result
of
other
robberies
at
sea
the
law
of
england
is
that
a
certain
percentage
of
such
recovered
treasure
belongs
to
the
crown
the
remainder
its
true
ownership
undetermined
to
be
fairly
divided
among
those
recovering
it
yet
spoke
up
dorothy
quickly
it
must
surely
be
possible
to
waive
all
claim
in
such
cases
certainly
as
private
property
it
can
be
disposed
of
in
any
way
desired
was
that
your
thought
a
fairfax
always
pays
his
debt
she
said
proudly
and
this
is
mine
there
was
a
moment
silence
as
though
each
one
present
hesitated
to
speak
she
had
risen
and
yet
stood
but
with
eyes
lowered
to
the
floor
then
they
were
lifted
and
met
mine
in
all
frank
honesty
there
is
another
debt
i
owe
she
said
clearly
and
would
pay
your
excellency
what
is
that
fair
mistress
she
crossed
to
me
her
hand
upon
my
arm
to
become
the
wife
of
geoffry
carlyle
