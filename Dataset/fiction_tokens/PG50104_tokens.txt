the
and
its
keeper
in
a
screened
and
secluded
corner
of
one
of
the
many
which
span
the
streets
of
london
there
could
be
seen
a
few
years
ago
from
five
every
morning
until
eight
a
tidily
set
out
consisting
of
a
trestle
and
board
upon
which
stood
two
large
tin
cans
with
a
small
fire
of
charcoal
burning
under
each
so
as
to
keep
the
coffee
boiling
during
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
when
the
were
thronging
into
the
city
on
their
way
to
their
daily
toil
the
was
a
favorite
one
for
besides
being
under
shelter
which
was
of
great
consequence
upon
rainy
mornings
it
was
also
in
so
private
a
niche
that
the
customers
taking
their
breakfast
were
not
too
much
exposed
to
notice
and
moreover
the
keeper
was
a
quiet
man
who
cared
only
to
serve
the
busy
workmen
without
hindering
them
by
any
gossip
he
was
a
tall
spare
elderly
man
with
a
singularly
solemn
face
and
a
manner
which
was
grave
and
secret
nobody
knew
either
his
name
or
unless
it
might
be
the
policeman
who
strode
past
the
every
and
nodded
familiarly
to
the
solemn
man
behind
it
there
were
very
few
who
cared
to
make
any
inquiries
about
him
but
those
who
did
could
only
discover
that
he
kept
the
furniture
of
his
stall
at
a
neighboring
whither
he
wheeled
his
trestle
and
board
and
crockery
every
day
not
later
than
eight
in
the
morning
after
which
he
was
wont
to
glide
away
with
a
soft
footstep
and
a
mysterious
and
fugitive
air
with
many
backward
and
sidelong
glances
as
if
he
dreaded
observation
until
he
was
lost
among
the
crowds
which
thronged
the
streets
no
one
had
ever
had
the
persevering
curiosity
to
track
him
all
the
way
to
his
house
or
to
find
out
his
other
means
of
gaining
a
livelihood
but
in
general
his
stall
was
surrounded
by
customers
whom
he
served
with
silent
seriousness
and
who
did
not
grudge
to
pay
him
his
charge
for
the
refreshing
coffee
he
supplied
to
them
for
several
years
the
crowd
of
had
paused
by
the
under
the
when
one
morning
in
a
partial
lull
of
his
business
the
owner
became
suddenly
aware
of
a
pair
of
very
bright
dark
eyes
being
fastened
upon
him
and
the
slices
of
bread
and
butter
on
his
board
with
a
gaze
as
hungry
as
that
of
a
mouse
which
has
been
driven
by
famine
into
a
trap
a
thin
and
meagre
face
belonged
to
the
eyes
which
was
half
hidden
by
a
mass
of
matted
hair
hanging
over
the
forehead
and
down
the
neck
the
only
covering
which
the
head
or
neck
had
for
a
tattered
frock
scarcely
fastened
together
with
broken
strings
was
slipping
down
over
the
shivering
shoulders
of
the
little
girl
stooping
down
to
a
basket
behind
his
stall
he
caught
sight
of
two
bare
little
feet
curling
up
from
the
damp
pavement
as
the
child
lifted
up
first
one
and
then
other
and
laid
them
one
over
another
to
gain
a
momentary
feeling
of
warmth
whoever
the
wretched
child
was
she
did
not
speak
only
at
every
steaming
cupful
which
he
poured
out
of
his
can
her
dark
eyes
gleamed
hungrily
and
he
could
hear
her
smack
her
thin
lips
as
if
in
fancy
she
was
tasting
the
warm
and
fragrant
coffee
come
now
he
said
at
last
when
only
one
boy
was
left
taking
his
breakfast
leisurely
and
he
leaned
over
his
stall
to
speak
in
a
low
and
quiet
tone
you
go
away
little
girl
come
come
staying
too
long
you
just
going
sir
she
answered
shrugging
her
small
shoulders
to
draw
her
frock
up
higher
about
her
neck
raining
cats
and
dogs
outside
and
been
away
all
night
and
she
took
the
key
with
her
and
so
nice
to
smell
the
coffee
and
the
police
has
left
off
worriting
me
while
been
here
he
thinks
a
customer
taking
my
and
the
child
laughed
a
shrill
laugh
of
mockery
at
herself
and
the
policeman
had
no
breakfast
i
suppose
said
the
keeper
in
the
same
low
and
confidential
voice
and
leaning
over
his
stall
till
his
face
nearly
touched
the
thin
sharp
features
of
the
child
she
replied
coolly
i
shall
want
my
dinner
dreadful
bad
afore
i
get
it
i
know
you
often
feel
dreadful
hungry
do
you
sir
not
griped
yet
you
know
but
afore
i
taste
my
dinner
be
pretty
bad
i
tell
you
ah
very
bad
indeed
she
turned
away
with
a
knowing
nod
as
much
as
to
say
she
had
one
experience
in
life
to
which
he
was
quite
a
stranger
but
before
she
had
gone
half
a
dozen
steps
she
heard
the
quiet
voice
calling
to
her
in
rather
louder
tones
and
in
an
instant
she
was
back
at
the
stall
in
here
said
the
owner
in
a
cautious
whisper
a
little
coffee
left
and
a
few
crusts
there
you
must
never
come
again
you
know
i
never
give
to
beggars
and
if
begged
have
called
the
police
there
put
your
poor
feet
towards
the
fire
now
you
comfortable
the
child
looked
up
with
a
face
of
intense
satisfaction
she
was
seated
upon
an
empty
basket
with
her
feet
near
the
pan
of
charcoal
and
a
cup
of
steaming
coffee
on
her
lap
but
her
mouth
was
too
full
for
her
to
reply
except
by
a
very
deep
nod
which
expressed
unbounded
delight
the
man
was
busy
for
a
while
packing
up
his
crockery
but
every
now
and
then
he
stopped
to
look
down
upon
her
and
to
shake
his
head
your
name
he
asked
at
length
there
never
mind
i
care
what
it
is
your
name
to
do
with
me
i
wonder
jessica
said
the
girl
mother
and
every
body
calls
me
jess
be
tired
of
being
called
jess
if
you
were
me
jess
here
and
jess
there
and
every
body
wanting
me
to
go
errands
and
they
think
nothing
of
giving
me
smacks
and
kicks
and
pinches
look
here
whether
her
arms
were
black
and
blue
from
the
cold
or
from
he
could
not
tell
but
he
shook
his
head
again
seriously
and
the
child
felt
encouraged
to
go
on
wish
i
could
stay
here
for
ever
and
ever
just
as
i
am
she
cried
going
away
i
know
and
never
to
come
again
or
set
the
police
on
me
said
the
keeper
very
softly
and
looking
round
to
see
if
there
were
any
other
ragged
children
within
sight
promise
not
to
come
again
for
a
whole
week
and
not
to
tell
any
body
else
you
may
come
once
more
give
you
one
other
treat
but
you
must
be
off
off
sir
she
said
sharply
if
a
errand
i
could
go
on
do
it
all
right
i
would
let
me
carry
some
of
your
no
cried
the
man
run
away
like
a
good
girl
and
mind
not
to
see
you
again
for
a
whole
right
answered
jess
setting
off
down
the
rainy
street
at
a
quick
run
as
if
to
show
her
willing
agreement
to
the
bargain
while
the
keeper
with
many
a
cautious
glance
around
him
removed
his
stock
in
trade
to
the
near
at
hand
and
was
seen
no
more
for
the
rest
of
the
day
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
chapter
ii
temptation
her
part
of
the
bargain
jessica
faithfully
kept
and
though
the
solemn
and
silent
man
under
the
dark
shadow
of
the
bridge
looked
for
her
every
morning
as
he
served
his
customers
he
caught
no
glimpse
of
her
wan
face
and
thin
little
frame
but
when
the
appointed
time
was
finished
she
presented
herself
at
the
stall
with
her
hungry
eyes
fastened
again
upon
the
piles
of
buns
and
bread
and
butter
which
were
fast
disappearing
before
the
demands
of
the
buyers
the
business
was
at
its
height
and
the
famished
child
stood
quietly
on
one
side
watching
for
the
throng
to
melt
away
but
as
soon
as
the
nearest
church
clock
had
chimed
eight
she
drew
a
little
nearer
to
the
stall
and
at
a
signal
from
its
owner
she
slipped
between
the
trestles
of
his
stand
and
took
up
her
former
position
on
the
empty
basket
to
his
eyes
she
seemed
even
a
little
thinner
and
certainly
more
ragged
than
before
and
he
laid
a
whole
bun
a
stale
one
which
was
left
from
stock
upon
her
lap
as
she
lifted
the
cup
of
coffee
to
her
lips
with
both
her
benumbed
hands
your
name
she
asked
looking
up
to
him
with
her
keen
eyes
he
answered
hesitatingly
as
if
he
was
reluctant
to
tell
so
much
of
himself
christened
name
is
where
do
you
live
she
inquired
come
now
he
exclaimed
going
to
be
impudent
better
march
off
what
business
is
it
of
yours
where
i
live
i
want
to
know
where
you
live
i
can
tell
mean
no
offence
said
jess
humbly
i
thought
like
to
know
where
a
good
man
like
you
lived
a
very
good
man
you
know
he
answered
uneasily
afraid
but
you
are
you
know
continued
jess
make
good
coffee
prime
and
buns
too
and
been
watching
you
hundreds
of
times
afore
you
saw
me
and
the
police
leaves
you
alone
and
never
tells
you
to
move
on
oh
yes
you
must
be
a
very
good
daniel
sighed
and
fidgeted
about
his
crockery
with
a
grave
and
occupied
air
as
if
he
were
pondering
over
the
notion
of
goodness
he
made
good
coffee
and
the
police
left
him
alone
it
was
quite
true
yet
still
as
he
counted
up
the
store
of
pence
which
had
accumulated
in
his
strong
canvas
bag
he
sighed
again
still
more
heavily
he
purposely
let
one
of
his
pennies
fall
upon
the
muddy
pavement
and
went
on
counting
the
rest
busily
while
he
furtively
watched
the
little
girl
sitting
at
his
feet
without
a
shade
of
change
upon
her
small
face
she
covered
the
penny
with
her
foot
and
drew
it
in
carefully
towards
her
while
she
continued
to
chatter
fluently
to
him
for
a
moment
a
feeling
of
pain
shot
a
pang
through
heart
and
then
he
congratulated
himself
on
having
entrapped
the
young
thief
it
was
time
to
be
leaving
now
but
before
he
went
he
would
make
her
move
her
bare
foot
and
disclose
the
penny
concealed
beneath
it
and
then
he
would
warn
her
never
to
venture
near
his
stall
again
this
was
her
gratitude
he
thought
he
had
given
her
two
breakfasts
and
more
kindness
than
he
had
shown
to
any
for
many
a
long
year
and
at
the
first
chance
the
young
jade
turned
upon
him
and
robbed
him
he
was
brooding
over
it
painfully
in
his
mind
when
uplifted
face
changed
suddenly
a
dark
flush
crept
over
her
pale
cheeks
and
the
tears
started
to
her
eyes
she
stooped
down
and
picking
up
the
coin
from
among
the
mud
she
rubbed
it
bright
and
clean
upon
her
rags
and
laid
it
upon
the
stall
close
to
his
hand
but
without
speaking
a
word
daniel
looked
down
upon
her
solemnly
and
searchingly
this
he
asked
she
answered
dropped
and
you
hear
he
said
sternly
me
all
about
please
she
sobbed
never
had
a
penny
of
my
own
but
once
and
it
rolled
close
to
my
foot
and
you
see
it
and
i
hid
it
up
sharp
and
then
i
thought
how
kind
been
and
how
good
the
coffee
and
buns
are
and
how
you
let
me
warm
myself
at
your
fire
and
please
i
keep
the
penny
any
longer
never
let
me
come
again
i
daniel
turned
away
for
a
moment
busying
himself
with
putting
his
cups
and
saucers
into
the
basket
while
jessica
stood
by
trembling
with
the
large
tears
rolling
slowly
down
her
cheeks
the
snug
dark
corner
with
its
warm
fire
of
charcoal
and
its
fragrant
smell
of
coffee
had
been
a
paradise
to
her
for
these
two
brief
spans
of
time
but
she
had
been
guilty
of
the
sin
which
would
drive
her
from
it
all
beyond
the
the
streets
stretched
away
cold
and
dreary
with
no
friendly
face
to
meet
hers
and
no
warm
cups
of
coffee
to
refresh
her
yet
she
was
only
lingering
sorrowfully
to
hear
the
words
spoken
which
should
forbid
her
to
return
to
this
pleasant
spot
daniel
turned
round
at
last
and
met
her
tearful
gaze
with
a
look
of
strange
emotion
upon
his
own
solemn
face
he
said
could
never
have
done
it
myself
but
you
may
come
here
every
wednesday
morning
as
this
is
a
wednesday
and
always
be
a
cup
of
coffee
for
she
thought
he
meant
that
he
could
not
have
hidden
the
penny
under
his
foot
and
she
went
away
a
little
saddened
and
subdued
notwithstanding
her
great
delight
in
the
expectation
of
such
a
treat
every
week
while
daniel
pondering
over
the
struggle
that
must
have
passed
through
her
childish
mind
went
on
his
way
from
time
to
time
shaking
his
head
muttering
to
himself
have
done
it
myself
i
never
could
have
done
it
chapter

an
old
friend
in
a
new
dress
week
after
week
through
the
three
last
months
of
the
year
jessica
appeared
every
wednesday
at
the
and
after
waiting
patiently
till
the
close
of
the
breakfasting
business
received
her
pittance
from
the
charity
of
her
new
friend
after
a
while
daniel
allowed
her
to
carry
some
of
his
load
to
the
but
he
never
suffered
her
to
follow
him
farther
and
he
was
always
particular
to
watch
her
out
of
sight
before
he
turned
off
through
the
intricate
mazes
of
the
streets
in
the
direction
of
his
own
home
neither
did
he
encourage
her
to
ask
him
any
more
questions
and
often
but
very
few
words
passed
between
them
during
breakfast
time
as
to
home
she
made
no
secret
of
it
and
daniel
might
have
followed
her
any
time
he
pleased
it
was
a
single
room
which
had
once
been
a
over
the
stable
of
an
old
inn
now
in
use
for
two
or
three
donkeys
the
property
of
costermongers
dwelling
in
the
court
about
it
the
mode
of
entrance
was
by
a
wooden
ladder
whose
rungs
were
crazy
and
broken
and
which
led
up
through
a
in
the
floor
of
the
loft
the
interior
of
the
home
was
as
desolate
and
comfortless
as
that
of
the
stable
below
with
only
a
litter
of
straw
for
the
bedding
and
a
few
bricks
and
boards
for
the
furniture
every
thing
that
could
be
pawned
had
disappeared
long
ago
and
mother
often
lamented
that
she
could
not
thus
dispose
of
her
child
yet
jessica
was
hardly
a
burden
to
her
it
was
a
long
time
since
she
had
taken
any
care
to
provide
her
with
food
or
clothing
and
the
girl
had
to
earn
or
beg
for
herself
the
meat
which
kept
a
scanty
life
within
her
jess
was
the
drudge
and
of
the
court
and
what
with
being
cuffed
and
beaten
by
her
mother
and
overworked
and
by
her
numerous
employers
her
life
was
a
hard
one
but
now
there
was
always
wednesday
morning
to
count
upon
and
look
forward
to
and
by
and
by
a
second
scene
of
amazed
delight
opened
upon
her
jessica
had
wandered
far
away
from
home
in
the
early
darkness
of
a
evening
after
a
violent
outbreak
of
her
drunken
mother
and
she
was
still
sobbing
now
and
then
with
sobs
of
pain
and
weariness
when
she
saw
a
little
way
before
her
the
tall
figure
of
her
friend
daniel
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
black
with
a
white
neckcloth
and
he
was
pacing
with
brisk
yet
measured
steps
along
the
lighted
streets

felt
afraid
of
speaking
to
him
but
she
followed
at
a
little
distance
until
presently
he
stopped
before
the
iron
gates
of
a
large
building
and
unlocking
them
passed
on
to
the
arched
doorway
and
with
a
heavy
key
opened
the
and
entered
in
the
child
stole
after
him
but
paused
for
a
few
minutes
trembling
upon
the
threshold
until
the
gleam
of
a
light
lit
up
within
tempted
her
to
venture
a
few
steps
forward
and
to
push
a
little
way
open
an
inner
door
covered
with
crimson
baize
only
so
far
as
to
enable
her
to
peep
through
at
the
inside
then
growing
bolder
by
degrees
she
crept
through
herself
drawing
the
door
to
noiselessly
behind
her
the
place
was
in
partial
gloom
but
daniel
was
kindling
every
gaslight
and
each
minute
lit
it
up
in
more
striking
grandeur
she
stood
in
a
carpeted
aisle
with
high
oaken
pews
on
each
side
almost
as
black
as
ebony
a
gallery
of
the
same
dark
old
oak
ran
round
the
walls
resting
upon
massive
pillars
behind
one
of
which
she
was
partly
concealed
gazing
with
eager
eyes
at
daniel
as
he
mounted
the
pulpit
steps
and
kindled
the
lights
there
disclosing
to
her
curious
delight
the
glittering
pipes
of
an
organ
behind
it
before
long
the
slow
and
disappeared
for
a
moment
or
two
into
a
vestry
and
jessica
availing
herself
of
his
short
absence
stole
silently
up
under
the
shelter
of
the
dark
pews
until
she
reached
the
steps
of
the
organ
loft
with
its
golden
show
but
at
this
moment
daniel
appeared
again
arrayed
in
a
long
gown
of
black
serge
and
as
she
stood
gazing
at
the
strange
appearance
of
her
patron
his
eyes
fell
upon
her
and
he
also
was
struck
speechless
for
a
minute
with
an
air
of
amazement
and
dismay
upon
his
grave
face
now
he
exclaimed
harshly
as
soon
as
he
could
recover
his
presence
of
mind
must
take
yourself
out
of
this
this
any
place
for
such
as
you
for
ladies
and
gentlemen
so
you
must
run
away
sharp
before
any
body
comes
how
did
you
ever
find
your
way
here
he
had
come
very
close
to
her
and
bent
down
to
whisper
in
her
ear
looking
nervously
round
to
the
entrance
all
the
time
eager
tongue
was
loosened
beat
me
she
said
turned
me
into
the
streets
and
i
see
you
there
so
i
followed
you
up
run
away
this
minute
daniel
but
a
nice
place
what
do
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
do
when
they
come
here
tell
me
and
be
off
come
here
to
pray
whispered
daniel
is
pray
asked
jessica
the
child
cried
daniel
in
perplexity
they
kneel
down
in
those
pews
most
of
them
sit
though
and
the
minister
up
in
the
pulpit
tells
god
what
they
jessica
gazed
into
his
face
with
such
an
air
of
bewilderment
that
a
faint
smile
crept
over
the
sedate
features
of
the
is
a
minister
and
god
she
said
do
ladies
and
gentlemen
want
any
thing
i
thought
every
thing
they
wanted
cried
daniel
must
be
off
you
know
be
coming
in
a
minute
and
be
shocked
to
see
a
ragged
little
heathen
like
you
this
is
the
pulpit
where
the
minister
stands
and
preaches
to
and
there
are
the
pews
where
they
sit
to
listen
to
him
or
to
go
to
sleep
may
be
and
the
organ
to
play
music
to
their
singing
there
told
you
every
thing
and
you
must
never
come
again
daniel
said
jessica
know
nothing
about
it
there
a
dark
little
corner
somewhere
that
i
could
hide
in
no
interrupted
daniel
impatiently
do
with
such
a
little
heathen
with
no
shoes
or
bonnet
on
come
now
only
a
quarter
to
the
time
and
somebody
will
be
here
in
a
minute
run
away
do
jessica
retraced
her
steps
slowly
to
the
crimson
door
casting
many
a
longing
look
backwards
but
daniel
stood
at
the
end
of
the
aisle
frowning
upon
her
whenever
she
glanced
behind
she
gained
the
lobby
at
last
but
already
some
one
was
approaching
the
chapel
door
and
beneath
the
lamp
at
the
gate
stood
one
of
her
natural
enemies
a
policeman
her
heart
beat
fast
but
she
was
quickwitted
and
in
another
instant
she
spied
a
place
of
concealment
behind
one
of
the
doors
into
which
she
crept
for
safety
until
the
policeman
passed
on
upon
his
beat
illustration
the
congregation
began
to
arrive
quickly
she
heard
the
rustling
of
silk
dresses
and
she
could
see
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
pass
by
the
niche
between
the
door
and
the
post
once
she
ventured
to
stretch
out
a
thin
little
finger
and
touch
a
velvet
mantle
as
the
wearer
of
it
swept
by
but
no
one
caught
her
in
the
act
or
suspected
her
presence
behind
the
door
daniel
she
could
see
was
very
busy
ushering
the
people
to
their
seats
but
there
was
a
startled
look
lingering
upon
his
face
and
every
now
and
then
he
peered
anxiously
into
the
outer
gloom
and
darkness
and
even
once
called
to
the
policeman
to
ask
if
he
had
seen
a
ragged
child
hanging
about
after
a
while
the
organ
began
to
sound
and
jessica
crouched
down
in
her
listening
entranced
to
the
sweet
music
she
could
not
tell
what
made
her
cry
but
the
tears
came
so
rapidly
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
rub
the
corners
of
her
eyes
with
her
hard
knuckles
so
she
lay
down
upon
the
ground
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
wept
without
restraint
when
the
singing
was
over
she
could
only
catch
a
confused
sound
of
a
voice
speaking
the
lobby
was
empty
now
and
the
crimson
doors
closed
the
policeman
also
had
walked
on
this
was
the
moment
to
escape
she
raised
herself
from
the
ground
with
a
feeling
of
weariness
and
sorrow
and
thinking
sadly
of
the
light
and
warmth
and
music
that
were
within
the
closed
doors
she
stepped
out
into
the
cold
and
darkness
of
the
streets
and
loitered
homeward
with
a
heavy
heart
chapter
iv
peeps
into
it
was
not
the
last
time
that
jessica
concealed
herself
behind
the
door
she
could
not
overcome
the
urgent
desire
to
enjoy
again
and
again
the
secret
and
perilous
pleasure
and
sunday
after
sunday
she
watched
in
the
dark
streets
for
the
moment
when
she
could
slip
in
unseen
she
soon
learned
the
exact
time
when
daniel
would
be
occupied
in
lighting
up
before
the
policeman
would
take
up
his
station
at
the
entrance
and
again
the
very
minute
at
which
it
would
be
wise
and
safe
to
take
her
departure
sometimes
the
child
laughed
noiselessly
to
herself
until
she
shook
with
suppressed
merriment
as
she
saw
daniel
standing
unconsciously
in
the
lobby
with
his
solemn
face
and
grave
air
to
receive
the
congregation
much
as
he
faced
his
customers
at
the
she
learned
to
know
the
minister
by
sight
the
tall
thin
pale
gentleman
who
passed
through
a
side
door
with
his
head
bent
as
if
in
deep
thought
while
two
little
girls
about
her
own
age
followed
him
with
sedate
yet
pleasant
faces
jessica
took
a
great
interest
in
the
children
the
younger
one
was
fair
and
the
elder
was
about
as
tall
as
herself
and
had
eyes
and
hair
as
dark
but
oh
how
cared
for
how
plainly
waited
on
by
tender
hands
sometimes
when
they
were
gone
by
she
would
close
her
eyes
and
wonder
what
they
would
do
in
one
of
the
high
black
pews
inside
where
there
was
no
place
for
a
ragged
barefooted
girl
like
her
and
now
and
then
her
wonderings
almost
ended
in
a
sob
which
she
was
compelled
to
stifle
it
was
an
untold
relief
to
daniel
that
jessica
did
not
ply
him
with
questions
as
he
feared
when
she
came
for
breakfast
every
wednesday
morning
but
she
was
too
shrewd
and
cunning
for
that
she
wished
him
to
forget
that
she
had
ever
been
there
and
her
wish
was
accomplished
and
daniel
was
no
longer
uneasy
while
he
was
lighting
the
lamps
with
the
dread
of
seeing
the
wild
face
starting
up
before
him
but
the
light
evenings
of
were
drawing
near
apace
and
jessica
foresaw
with
dismay
that
her
sunday
treats
would
soon
be
over
the
risk
of
discovery
increased
every
week
for
the
sun
was
later
in
setting
and
there
would
be
no
chance
of
creeping
in
and
out
unseen
in
the
broad
daylight
already
it
needed
both
watchfulness
and
alertness
to
dart
in
at
the
right
moment
in
the
gray
twilight
but
still
she
could
not
give
it
up
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fear
of
offending
daniel
she
would
have
resolved
upon
going
until
she
was
found
out
they
could
not
punish
her
very
much
for
standing
in
the
lobby
of
a
chapel
jessica
was
found
out
however
before
the
dusky
evenings
were
quite
gone
it
happened
one
night
that
the
children
coming
early
to
the
chapel
saw
a
small
tattered
figure
bareheaded
and
barefooted
dart
swiftly
up
the
steps
before
them
and
disappear
within
the
lobby
they
paused
and
looked
at
one
another
and
then
hand
in
hand
their
hearts
beating
quickly
and
the
color
coming
and
going
on
their
faces
they
followed
this
strange
new
member
of
their
congregation
the
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
their
quick
eyes
detected
the
prints
of
the
wet
little
feet
which
had
trodden
the
clean
pavement
before
them
and
in
an
instant
they
discovered
jessica
crouching
behind
the
door
us
call
daniel
standring
said
winny
the
younger
child
clinging
to
her
sister
but
she
had
spoken
aloud
and
jessica
overheard
her
and
before
they
could
stir
a
step
she
stood
before
them
with
an
earnest
and
imploring
face
have
me
drove
away
she
cried
a
very
poor
little
girl
and
all
the
pleasure
got
seen
you
lots
of
times
with
that
tall
gentleman
as
stoops
and
i
think
have
me
drove
away
i
do
any
harm
behind
the
door
and
if
daniel
finds
me
out
he
wont
give
me
any
more
girl
said
the
elder
child
in
a
composed
and
demure
voice
mean
to
be
unkind
to
you
but
what
do
you
come
here
for
and
why
do
you
hide
yourself
behind
the
door
like
to
hear
the
music
answered
jessica
i
want
to
find
out
what
pray
is
and
the
minister
and
god
i
know
only
for
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
fine
children
like
you
but
like
to
go
inside
just
for
once
and
see
what
you
shall
come
with
us
into
our
pew
cried
winny
in
an
eager
and
impulsive
tone
but
jane
laid
her
hand
upon
her
outstretched
arm
with
a
glance
at
ragged
clothes
and
matted
hair
it
was
a
question
difficult
enough
to
perplex
them
the
little
outcast
was
plainly
too
dirty
and
neglected
for
them
to
invite
her
to
sit
side
by
side
with
them
in
their
pew
and
no
poor
people
attended
the
chapel
with
whom
she
could
have
a
seat
but
winny
with
flushed
cheeks
and
indignant
eyes
looked
reproachfully
at
her
elder
sister
she
said
opening
her
testament
and
turning
over
the
leaves
hurriedly
was
text
a
little
while
ago
if
there
come
unto
your
assembly
a
man
with
a
gold
ring
in
goodly
apparel
and
there
come
in
also
a
poor
man
in
vile
raiment
and
ye
have
respect
to
him
that
weareth
the
gay
clothing
and
say
unto
him
sit
thou
here
in
a
good
place
and
say
to
the
poor
stand
thou
there
or
sit
here
under
my
footstool
are
ye
not
then
partial
in
yourselves
and
are
become
judges
of
evil
thoughts
if
we
take
this
little
girl
into
our
pew
we
the
faith
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
lord
of
glory
with
respect
of
know
what
to
do
answered
jane
sighing
bible
seems
plain
but
sure
papa
would
not
like
it
let
us
ask
the
no
no
cried
jessica
let
daniel
catch
me
here
i
wont
come
again
indeed
and
promise
not
to
try
to
find
out
about
god
and
the
minister
if
only
let
me
little
girl
said
jane
in
a
sweet
but
grave
manner
ought
to
teach
you
about
god
if
you
know
him
our
papa
is
the
minister
and
if
come
with
us
ask
him
what
we
must
daniel
see
me
asked
jessica
but
papa
is
in
the
vestry
answered
jane
tell
us
all
you
and
us
what
we
ought
to
do
not
be
afraid
of
him
will
you
said
jessica
cheerfully
following
the
children
as
they
led
her
along
the
side
of
the
chapel
towards
the
vestry
is
not
such
a
terrible
personage
said
winny
looking
round
encouragingly
as
jane
tapped
softly
at
the
door
and
they
heard
a
voice
saying
chapter
a
new
world
opens
the
minister
was
siting
in
an
easy
chair
before
a
comfortable
fire
with
a
in
his
hand
which
he
closed
as
the
three
children
appeared
in
the
open
doorway
jessica
had
seen
his
pale
and
thoughtful
face
many
a
time
from
her
but
she
had
never
met
the
keen
earnest
searching
gaze
of
his
eyes
which
seemed
to
pierce
through
all
her
wretchedness
and
misery
and
to
read
at
once
the
whole
history
of
her
desolate
life
but
before
her
eyelids
could
droop
or
she
could
drop
a
reverential
courtesy
the
face
kindled
with
such
a
glow
of
pitying
tenderness
and
compassion
as
fastened
her
eyes
upon
him
and
gave
her
new
heart
and
courage
his
children
ran
to
him
leaving
jessica
upon
the
mat
at
the
door
and
with
eager
voices
and
gestures
told
him
the
difficulty
they
were
in
here
little
girl
he
said
and
jessica
walked
across
the
carpeted
floor
till
she
stood
right
before
him
with
folded
hands
and
eyes
that
looked
frankly
into
his
is
your
name
my
child
he
asked
she
answered
he
repeated
with
a
smile
is
a
strange
used
to
play
at
the
theatre
sir
she
said
i
used
to
be
a
fairy
in
the
pantomime
till
i
grew
too
tall
and
ugly
if
pretty
when
i
grow
up
mother
says
i
shall
play
too
but
a
long
time
to
wait
are
you
the
minister
sir
he
answered
smiling
again
is
a
minister
she
inquired
servant
he
replied
looking
away
thoughtfully
into
the
red
embers
of
the
fire
cried
jane
and
winny
in
tones
of
astonishment
but
jessica
gazed
steadily
at
the
minister
who
was
now
looking
back
again
into
her
bright
eyes
sir
whose
servant
are
you
she
asked
servant
of
god
and
of
man
he
answered
solemnly
i
am
your
the
child
shook
her
head
and
laughed
shrilly
as
she
gazed
round
the
room
and
at
the
handsome
clothing
of
the
daughters
while
she
drew
her
rags
closer
about
her
and
shivered
a
little
as
if
she
felt
a
sting
of
the
east
wind
which
was
blowing
keenly
through
the
streets
the
sound
of
her
shrill
childish
laugh
made
the
heart
ache
is
god
asked
the
child
in
a
good
temper
sometimes
she
says
bless
me
do
you
know
him
please
minister
but
before
there
was
time
to
answer
the
door
into
the
chapel
was
opened
and
daniel
stood
upon
the
threshold
at
first
he
stared
blandly
forward
but
then
his
grave
face
grew
ghastly
pale
and
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
door
to
support
himself
until
he
could
recover
his
speech
and
senses
jessica
also
looked
about
her
scared
and
irresolute
as
if
anxious
to
run
away
or
to
hide
herself
the
minister
was
the
first
to
speak
he
said
is
a
place
close
under
my
pulpit
where
you
shall
sit
and
where
i
can
see
you
all
the
time
be
a
good
girl
and
listen
and
you
will
hear
something
about
god
standring
put
this
little
one
in
front
of
the
pews
by
the
pulpit
before
she
could
believe
it
for
very
gladness
jessica
found
herself
inside
the
chapel
facing
the
glittering
organ
from
which
a
sweet
strain
of
music
was
sounding
not
far
from
her
jane
and
winny
were
peeping
over
the
front
of
their
pew
with
friendly
smiles
and
glances
it
was
evident
that
the
elder
daughter
was
anxious
about
her
behavior
and
she
made
energetic
signs
to
her
when
to
stand
and
when
to
kneel
but
winny
was
content
with
smiling
at
her
whenever
her
head
rose
above
the
top
of
the
pew
jessica
was
happy
but
not
in
the
least
abashed
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
not
at
all
unlike
those
whom
she
had
often
seen
when
she
was
a
fairy
at
the
theatre
and
very
soon
her
attention
was
engrossed
by
the
minister
whose
eyes
often
fell
upon
her
as
she
gazed
eagerly
with
uplifted
face
upon
him
she
could
scarcely
understand
a
word
of
what
he
said
but
she
liked
the
tones
of
his
voice
and
the
tender
pity
of
his
face
as
he
looked
down
upon
her
daniel
hovered
about
a
good
deal
with
an
air
of
uneasiness
and
displeasure
but
she
was
unconscious
of
his
presence
jessica
was
intent
upon
finding
out
what
a
minister
and
god
were
chapter
vi
the
first
prayer
when
the
service
was
ended
the
minister
descended
the
pulpit
steps
just
as
daniel
was
about
to
hurry
jessica
away
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
in
the
face
of
all
the
congregation
he
led
her
into
the
vestry
whither
jane
and
winny
quickly
followed
them
he
was
fatigued
with
the
services
of
the
day
and
his
pale
face
was
paler
than
ever
as
he
placed
jessica
before
his
chair
into
which
he
threw
himself
with
an
air
of
exhaustion
but
bowing
his
head
upon
his
hands
he
said
in
a
low
but
clear
tone
these
are
the
lambs
of
thy
flock
help
me
to
feed
thy
lambs
he
said
with
a
smile
upon
his
weary
face
is
no
easy
thing
to
know
god
but
this
one
thing
we
know
that
he
is
our
father
my
father
and
your
father
jessica
he
loves
you
and
cares
for
you
more
than
i
do
for
my
little
girls
he
smiled
at
them
and
they
at
him
with
an
expression
which
jessica
felt
and
understood
though
it
made
her
sad
she
trembled
a
little
and
the
ear
caught
the
sound
of
a
faint
though
bitter
sob
never
had
any
father
she
said
sorrowfully
is
your
father
he
answered
very
gently
knows
all
about
you
because
he
is
present
everywhere
we
can
not
see
him
but
we
have
only
to
speak
and
he
hears
us
and
we
may
ask
him
for
whatever
we
he
let
me
speak
to
him
as
well
as
these
fine
children
that
are
clean
and
have
got
nice
clothes
asked
jessica
glancing
anxiously
at
her
muddy
feet
and
her
soiled
and
tattered
frock
said
the
minister
smiling
yet
sighing
at
the
same
time
may
ask
him
this
moment
for
what
you
jessica
gazed
round
the
room
with
large
eyes
as
if
she
were
seeking
to
see
god
but
then
she
shut
her
eyelids
tightly
and
bending
her
head
upon
her
hands
as
she
had
seen
the
minister
do
she
said
god
i
want
to
know
about
you
and
please
pay
daniel
for
all
the
warm
coffee
give
jane
and
winny
listened
with
faces
of
unutterable
amazement
but
the
tears
stood
in
the
eyes
and
he
added
to
first
prayer
chapter
vii
hard
questions
after
waiting
until
the
minister
left
the
vestry
daniel
found
that
jessica
had
gone
away
by
the
side
entrance
he
had
to
wait
therefore
until
wednesday
morning
for
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
her
and
the
sight
of
her
pinched
little
face
was
welcome
to
him
when
he
saw
it
looking
wistfully
over
the
yet
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
forbid
her
to
come
again
and
to
threaten
her
with
the
policeman
if
he
ever
caught
her
at
the
chapel
where
for
the
future
he
intended
to
keep
a
sharper
lookout
but
before
he
could
speak
jess
had
slipped
under
the
stall
and
taken
her
old
seat
upon
the
upturned
basket
daniel
she
said
god
paid
you
for
my
sups
of
coffee
yet
me
he
repeated
he
will
she
answered
nodding
her
head
sagely
you
be
afraid
for
your
money
daniel
asked
him
a
many
times
and
the
minister
says
sure
to
do
said
daniel
sternly
you
been
and
told
the
minister
about
my
she
answered
with
a
beaming
smile
told
god
lots
and
lots
of
times
since
sunday
and
sure
to
pay
in
a
day
or
continued
daniel
more
gently
a
sharp
little
girl
i
see
and
now
mind
going
to
trust
you
never
to
say
a
word
about
me
or
my
because
the
folks
at
our
chapel
are
very
grand
and
might
think
it
low
and
mean
of
me
to
keep
a
very
likely
say
i
be
any
longer
and
i
should
lose
a
deal
of
do
you
keep
the
stall
then
asked
jessica
you
see
what
a
many
pennies
i
get
every
morning
he
said
shaking
his
canvas
bag
get
a
good
deal
of
money
that
way
in
a
do
you
want
such
a
deal
of
money
for
she
inquired
you
give
it
to
god
daniel
did
not
answer
but
the
question
went
to
his
heart
like
a
what
did
he
want
so
much
money
for
he
thought
of
his
bare
and
solitary
room
where
he
lodged
alone
a
good
way
from
the
with
very
few
comforts
in
it
but
containing
a
desk
strong
securely
fastened
and
in
which
were
his
bank
book
his
receipts
for
money
put
out
at
interest
and
a
bag
of
sovereigns
for
which
he
had
been
toiling
and
slaving
both
on
sunday
and
he
could
not
remember
giving
any
thing
away
except
the
dregs
of
the
coffee
and
the
stale
buns
for
which
jessica
was
asking
god
to
pay
him
he
coughed
and
cleared
his
throat
and
rubbed
his
eyes
and
then
with
nervous
and
hesitating
fingers
he
took
a
penny
from
his
bag
and
slipped
it
into
hand
no
daniel
she
said
want
you
to
give
me
any
of
your
pennies
i
want
god
to
pay
pay
me
muttered
daniel
be
a
day
of
reckoning
by
and
god
have
reckoning
days
asked
jessica
used
to
like
reckoning
days
when
i
was
a
ay
he
answered
few
folks
like
reckoning
be
glad
wont
you
she
said
daniel
bade
her
get
on
with
her
breakfast
and
then
he
turned
over
in
his
mind
the
thoughts
which
her
questions
had
awakened
conscience
told
him
he
would
not
be
glad
to
meet
reckoning
day
daniel
said
jessica
when
they
were
about
to
separate
and
he
would
not
take
back
his
gift
of
a
penny
you
mind
like
to
come
and
buy
a
cup
of
coffee
like
a
customer
you
know
and
i
wont
let
out
a
word
about
the
stall
to
the
minister
next
sunday
you
be
she
tied
the
penny
carefully
into
a
corner
of
her
rags
and
with
a
cheerful
smile
upon
her
thin
face
she
glided
from
under
the
shadow
of
the
bridge
and
was
soon
lost
to
sight
chapter
viii
an
unexpected
visitor
when
jessica
came
to
the
street
into
which
the
court
where
she
lived
opened
she
saw
an
unusual
degree
of
excitement
among
the
inhabitants
a
group
of
whom
were
gathered
about
a
tall
gentleman
whom
she
recognized
in
an
instant
to
be
the
minister
she
elbowed
her
way
through
the
midst
of
them
and
the
face
brightened
as
she
presented
herself
before
him
he
followed
her
up
the
low
entry
across
the
squalid
court
through
the
stable
empty
of
the
donkeys
just
then
up
the
creaking
rounds
of
the
ladder
and
into
the
miserable
loft
where
the
tiles
were
falling
in
and
the
broken
were
stuffed
with
rags
and
paper
near
to
the
old
rusty
stove
which
served
as
a
grate
when
there
was
any
fire
there
was
a
short
board
laid
across
some
bricks
and
upon
this
the
minister
took
his
seat
while
jessica
sat
upon
the
floor
before
him
he
said
sadly
this
where
you
live
she
answered
a
nicer
room
than
this
when
i
was
a
fairy
and
mother
played
at
the
theatre
we
shall
be
better
off
when
grown
up
if
pretty
enough
to
play
like
child
he
said
come
to
ask
your
mother
to
let
you
go
to
school
in
a
pleasant
place
down
in
the
country
will
she
let
you
go
answered
jessica
says
never
let
me
learn
to
read
or
go
to
church
she
says
it
would
make
me
good
for
nothing
but
please
sir
she
know
any
thing
about
your
church
such
a
long
way
off
and
she
found
me
out
yet
she
always
gets
very
drunk
of
a
the
child
spoke
simply
and
as
if
all
she
said
was
a
matter
of
course
but
the
minister
shuddered
and
he
looked
through
the
broken
window
to
the
little
patch
of
gloomy
sky
overhead
can
i
do
he
cried
mournfully
as
though
speaking
to
himself
please
sir
said
jessica
let
me
come
to
hear
you
of
a
sunday
and
tell
me
about
god
if
you
was
to
give
me
fine
clothes
like
your
little
mother
only
pawn
them
for
gin
you
do
any
thing
more
for
is
your
mother
he
asked
on
a
spree
said
jessica
wont
be
home
for
a
day
or
two
not
hearken
to
you
sir
the
missionary
came
and
she
pushed
him
down
the
ladder
till
he
was
nearly
killed
they
used
to
call
mother
at
the
theatre
and
nobody
durst
say
a
word
to
the
minister
was
silent
for
some
minutes
thinking
painful
thoughts
for
his
eyes
seemed
to
darken
as
he
looked
round
the
miserable
room
and
his
face
wore
an
air
of
sorrow
and
disappointment
at
last
he
spoke
again
is
daniel
jessica
he
inquired
she
said
cunningly
only
a
friend
of
mine
as
gives
me
sups
of
coffee
you
know
all
the
folks
in
london
sir
he
answered
smiling
does
he
keep
a
jessica
nodded
her
head
but
did
not
trust
herself
to
speak
much
does
a
cup
of
coffee
cost
asked
the
minister
full
a
penny
she
answered
promptly
you
can
have
half
a
cup
and
there
are
and
penny
coffee
and
buns
he
said
with
another
smile
replied
jessica
smacking
her
lips
continued
the
minister
your
friend
to
give
you
a
full
cup
of
coffee
and
a
penny
bun
every
morning
and
pay
for
them
as
often
as
he
chooses
to
come
to
me
for
the
face
beamed
with
delight
but
in
an
instant
it
clouded
over
as
she
recollected
secret
and
her
lips
quivered
as
she
spoke
her
disappointed
reply
sir
she
said
sure
he
come
oh
he
such
a
long
way
and
daniel
has
plenty
of
customers
no
he
never
would
come
to
you
for
he
answered
will
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
trust
you
with
a
shilling
every
sunday
if
promise
to
give
it
to
your
friend
the
very
first
time
you
see
him
i
shall
be
sure
to
know
if
you
cheat
and
the
keen
piercing
eyes
of
the
minister
looked
down
into
and
once
more
the
tender
and
pitying
smile
returned
to
his
face
can
do
nothing
else
for
you
he
said
in
a
tone
of
mingled
sorrow
and
questioning
minister
answered
jessica
tell
me
about
will
tell
you
one
thing
about
him
now
he
replied
i
took
you
to
live
in
my
house
with
my
little
daughters
you
would
have
to
be
washed
and
clothed
in
new
clothing
to
make
you
fit
for
it
god
wanted
us
to
go
and
live
at
home
with
him
in
heaven
but
we
were
so
sinful
that
we
could
never
have
been
fit
for
it
so
he
sent
his
own
son
to
live
among
us
and
die
for
us
to
wash
us
from
our
sins
and
to
give
us
new
clothing
and
to
make
us
ready
to
live
in
house
when
you
ask
god
for
any
thing
you
must
say
jesus
jesus
christ
is
the
son
of
after
these
words
the
minister
carefully
descended
the
ladder
followed
by
bare
and
nimble
feet
and
she
led
him
by
the
nearest
way
into
one
of
the
great
thoroughfares
of
the
city
where
he
said
to
her
adding
bless
you
my
child
in
a
tone
which
sank
into
heart
he
had
put
a
silver
sixpence
into
her
hand
to
provide
for
her
breakfast
the
next
three
mornings
and
with
a
feeling
of
being
very
rich
she
returned
to
her
miserable
home
the
next
morning
jessica
presented
herself
proudly
as
a
customer
at
stall
and
paid
over
the
sixpence
in
advance
he
felt
a
little
troubled
as
he
heard
her
story
lest
the
minister
should
endeavor
to
find
him
out
but
he
could
not
refuse
to
let
the
child
come
daily
for
her
comfortable
breakfast
if
he
was
detected
he
would
promise
to
give
up
his
rather
than
offend
the
great
people
of
the
chapel
but
unless
he
was
it
would
be
foolish
of
him
to
lose
the
money
it
brought
in
week
after
week
chapter
ix
first
prayer
answered
every
sunday
evening
the
barefooted
and
bareheaded
child
might
be
seen
advancing
confidently
up
to
the
chapel
where
rich
and
fashionable
people
worshipped
god
but
before
taking
her
place
she
arrayed
herself
in
a
little
cloak
and
bonnet
which
had
once
belonged
to
the
elder
daughter
and
which
was
kept
with
serge
gown
so
that
she
presented
a
somewhat
more
respectable
appearance
in
the
eyes
of
the
congregation
the
minister
had
no
listener
more
attentive
and
he
would
have
missed
the
pinched
earnest
little
face
if
it
were
not
to
be
seen
in
the
seat
just
under
the
pulpit
at
the
close
of
each
service
he
spoke
to
her
for
a
minute
or
two
in
his
vestry
often
saying
no
more
than
a
single
sentence
for
the
labor
had
wearied
him
the
shilling
which
was
always
lying
upon
the
placed
there
by
jane
and
winny
in
turns
was
immediately
handed
over
according
to
promise
to
daniel
as
she
left
the
chapel
and
so
breakfast
was
provided
for
her
week
after
week
but
at
last
there
came
a
sunday
evening
when
the
minister
going
up
into
his
pulpit
did
miss
the
wistful
hungry
face
and
the
shilling
lay
unclaimed
upon
the
vestry
daniel
looked
out
for
her
anxiously
every
morning
but
no
jessica
glided
into
his
secluded
corner
to
sit
beside
him
with
her
breakfast
on
her
lap
and
with
a
number
of
strange
questions
to
ask
he
felt
her
absence
more
keenly
than
he
could
have
expected
the
child
was
nothing
to
him
he
kept
saying
to
himself
and
yet
he
felt
that
she
was
something
and
that
he
could
not
help
being
uneasy
and
anxious
about
her
why
had
he
never
inquired
where
she
lived
the
minister
knew
and
for
a
minute
daniel
thought
he
would
go
and
ask
him
but
that
might
awaken
suspicion
how
could
he
account
for
so
much
anxiety
when
he
was
supposed
only
to
know
of
her
absence
from
chapel
one
sunday
evening
it
would
be
running
a
risk
and
after
all
jessica
was
nothing
to
him
so
he
went
home
and
looked
over
his
savings
bank
book
and
counted
his
money
and
he
found
to
his
satisfaction
that
he
had
gathered
together
nearly
four
hundred
pounds
and
that
he
was
adding
more
every
week
but
when
upon
the
next
sunday
seat
was
again
empty
the
anxiety
of
the
solemn
overcame
his
prudence
and
his
fears
the
minister
had
retired
to
his
vestry
and
was
standing
with
his
arm
resting
upon
the
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
unclaimed
shilling
which
winny
had
laid
there
before
the
service
when
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
daniel
entered
with
a
respectful
but
hesitating
air
standring
said
the
minister
questioningly
he
said
uncomfortable
about
that
little
girl
and
i
know
been
once
to
see
after
her
she
told
me
about
it
and
so
i
make
bold
to
ask
you
where
she
lives
and
see
become
of
standring
answered
the
minister
am
troubled
about
the
child
and
so
are
my
little
girls
i
thought
of
going
myself
but
my
time
is
very
much
occupied
just
go
sir
replied
daniel
promptly
and
after
receiving
the
necessary
information
about
home
he
put
out
the
lights
locked
the
door
and
turned
towards
his
lonely
lodgings
but
though
it
was
getting
late
upon
sunday
evening
and
home
was
a
long
way
distant
daniel
found
that
his
anxiety
would
not
suffer
him
to
return
to
his
solitary
room
it
was
of
no
use
to
reason
with
himself
as
he
stood
at
the
corner
of
the
street
feeling
perplexed
and
troubled
and
promising
his
conscience
that
he
would
go
the
very
first
thing
in
the
morning
after
he
shut
up
his
in
the
dim
dusky
light
as
the
summer
evening
drew
to
a
close
he
fancied
he
could
see
thin
figure
and
wan
face
gliding
on
before
him
and
turning
around
from
time
to
time
to
see
if
he
were
following
it
was
only
fancy
and
he
laughed
a
little
at
himself
but
the
laugh
was
husky
and
there
was
a
choking
sensation
in
his
throat
so
he
buttoned
his
sunday
coat
over
his
breast
where
his
silver
watch
and
chain
hung
temptingly
and
started
off
at
a
rapid
pace
for
the
centre
of
the
city
it
was
not
quite
dark
when
he
reached
the
court
and
stumbled
up
the
narrow
entry
leading
to
it
but
daniel
did
hesitate
when
he
opened
the
and
looked
into
a
blank
black
space
in
which
he
could
discern
nothing
he
thought
he
had
better
retreat
while
he
could
do
so
safely
but
as
he
still
stood
with
his
hand
upon
the
rusty
latch
he
heard
a
faint
small
voice
through
the
nicks
of
the
unceiled
boarding
above
his
head
father
said
the
little
voice
to
send
somebody
to
me
for
jesus
sake
here
jess
cried
daniel
with
a
sudden
bound
of
his
heart
such
as
he
had
not
felt
for
years
and
which
almost
took
away
his
breath
as
he
peered
into
the
darkness
until
at
last
he
discerned
dimly
the
ladder
which
led
up
into
the
loft
illustration
very
cautiously
but
with
an
eagerness
which
surprised
himself
he
climbed
up
the
creaking
rounds
of
the
ladder
and
entered
the
dismal
room
where
the
child
was
lying
in
desolate
darkness
fortunately
he
had
his
box
of
matches
in
his
pocket
and
the
end
of
a
wax
candle
with
which
he
kindled
the
lamps
and
in
another
minute
a
gleam
of
light
shone
upon
white
features
she
was
stretched
upon
a
scanty
litter
of
straw
under
the
slanting
roof
where
the
tiles
had
not
fallen
off
with
her
poor
rags
for
her
only
covering
but
as
her
eyes
looked
up
into
face
bending
over
her
a
bright
smile
of
joy
sparkled
in
them
she
cried
gladly
but
in
a
feeble
voice
daniel
has
god
told
you
to
come
here
daniel
said
daniel
kneeling
beside
her
taking
her
wasted
hand
in
his
and
parting
the
matted
hair
upon
her
damp
forehead
did
he
say
to
you
said
jessica
told
me
i
was
a
great
sinner
replied
daniel
told
me
i
loved
a
little
bit
of
dirty
money
better
than
a
poor
friendless
helpless
child
whom
he
had
sent
to
me
to
see
if
i
would
do
her
a
little
good
for
his
sake
he
looked
at
me
or
the
minister
did
through
and
through
and
he
said
fool
this
night
thy
soul
shall
be
required
of
thee
then
whose
shall
those
things
be
which
thou
hast
provided
and
i
could
answer
him
nothing
jess
he
had
come
to
a
reckoning
with
me
and
i
could
not
say
a
word
to
you
a
good
man
daniel
whispered
jessica
a
wicked
sinner
he
cried
while
the
tears
rolled
down
his
solemn
face
been
constant
at
house
but
only
to
get
money
been
steady
and
industrious
but
only
to
get
money
and
now
god
looks
at
me
and
he
says
fool
oh
jess
jess
more
fit
for
heaven
than
i
ever
was
in
my
life
you
ask
him
to
make
you
good
for
jesus
sake
asked
the
child
he
said
been
kneeling
down
sunday
after
sunday
when
the
been
praying
but
all
the
time
i
was
thinking
how
rich
some
of
the
carriage
people
were
been
loving
money
and
worshipping
money
all
along
and
nearly
let
you
die
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
losing
part
of
my
earnings
a
very
sinful
you
know
what
the
minister
often
says
murmured
jessica
is
love
not
that
we
loved
god
but
that
he
loved
us
and
sent
his
son
to
be
the
propitiation
for
our
heard
it
so
often
that
i
feel
it
said
daniel
used
to
like
to
hear
the
minister
say
it
but
now
it
goes
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
my
heart
is
very
hard
by
the
feeble
glimmer
of
the
candle
daniel
saw
wistful
eyes
fixed
upon
him
with
a
sad
and
loving
glance
and
then
she
lifted
up
her
weak
hand
to
her
face
and
laid
it
over
her
closed
eyelids
and
her
feverish
lips
moved
slowly
she
said
to
make
heart
soft
for
jesus
sake
she
did
not
speak
again
nor
daniel
for
some
time
he
took
off
his
sunday
coat
and
laid
it
over
the
tiny
shivering
frame
which
was
shaking
with
cold
even
in
the
summer
evening
and
as
he
did
so
he
remembered
the
words
which
the
lord
says
he
will
pronounce
at
the
last
day
of
reckoning
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
one
of
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
ye
have
done
it
unto
daniel
standring
felt
his
heart
turning
with
love
to
the
saviour
and
he
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
cried
in
the
depths
of
his
contrite
spirit
be
merciful
to
me
a
chapter
x
the
shadow
of
death
there
was
no
opened
under
the
railway
arch
the
following
morning
and
regular
customers
stood
amazed
as
they
drew
near
the
empty
corner
where
they
were
accustomed
to
get
their
early
breakfast
it
would
have
astonished
them
still
more
if
they
could
have
seen
how
he
was
occupied
in
the
miserable
loft
he
had
intrusted
a
friendly
woman
out
of
the
court
to
buy
food
and
fuel
and
all
night
long
he
had
watched
beside
jessica
who
was
and
delirious
but
in
the
wanderings
of
her
thoughts
and
words
often
spoke
to
god
and
prayed
for
her
daniel
the
neighbor
informed
him
that
the
mother
had
gone
off
some
days
before
fearing
that
she
was
ill
of
some
infectious
fever
and
that
she
alone
had
taken
a
little
care
of
her
from
time
to
time
as
soon
as
the
morning
came
he
sent
for
a
doctor
and
after
receiving
permission
from
him
he
wrapped
the
poor
deserted
jessica
in
his
coat
and
bearing
her
tenderly
in
his
arms
down
the
ladder
he
carried
her
to
a
cab
which
the
neighbor
brought
to
the
entrance
of
the
court
it
was
to
no
other
than
his
own
solitary
home
that
he
had
resolved
to
take
her
and
when
the
mistress
of
the
lodgings
stood
at
her
door
with
her
arms
to
forbid
the
admission
of
the
wretched
and
neglected
child
her
tongue
was
silenced
by
the
gleam
of
a
which
daniel
slipped
into
the
palm
of
her
hard
hand
by
that
post
the
minister
received
the
following
letter
sir
you
will
condescend
to
enter
under
my
humble
roof
you
will
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
little
jessica
who
is
at
the
point
of
death
unless
god
in
his
mercy
restores
her
hoping
you
will
excuse
this
liberty
as
i
can
not
leave
the
child
i
remain
with
duty
respectful
servant
standring
jessica
desires
her
best
love
and
duty
to
miss
jane
and
the
minister
laid
aside
the
book
he
was
reading
and
without
any
delay
started
off
for
his
dwelling
there
was
jessica
lying
restfully
upon
bed
but
the
pinched
features
were
deadly
pale
and
the
sunken
eyes
shone
with
a
waning
light
she
was
too
feeble
to
turn
her
head
when
the
door
opened
and
he
paused
for
a
moment
looking
at
her
and
at
daniel
who
seated
at
the
head
of
the
bed
was
turning
over
the
papers
in
his
desk
and
reckoning
up
once
more
the
savings
of
his
lifetime
but
when
the
minister
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room
white
cheeks
flushed
into
deep
red
minister
she
cried
has
given
me
every
thing
i
wanted
except
paying
daniel
for
the
coffee
he
used
to
give
me
but
god
has
paid
me
over
and
over
again
said
daniel
rising
to
receive
the
minister
given
me
my
own
soul
in
exchange
for
it
let
me
make
bold
to
speak
to
you
this
once
sir
a
very
learned
man
and
a
great
preacher
and
many
people
flock
to
hear
you
till
hard
put
to
it
to
find
seats
for
them
at
times
but
all
the
while
hearkening
to
you
every
blessed
sabbath
i
was
losing
my
soul
and
you
never
once
said
to
me
though
you
saw
me
scores
and
scores
of
times
are
you
a
saved
man
said
the
minister
in
a
tone
of
great
distress
and
regret
always
took
it
for
granted
that
you
were
a
continued
daniel
thoughtfully
god
wanted
somebody
to
ask
me
that
question
and
he
did
not
find
anybody
in
the
congregation
so
he
sent
this
poor
little
lass
to
me
well
i
mind
telling
now
even
if
i
lose
the
place
but
for
a
long
time
nigh
upon
ten
years
kept
a
on
in
the
city
and
cleared
one
week
with
another
about
ten
shillings
but
i
was
afraid
the
approve
of
the
coffee
business
as
low
so
i
kept
it
a
close
secret
and
always
shut
up
early
of
a
morning
me
that
sold
jessica
her
cup
of
coffee
which
you
paid
for
no
harm
in
it
my
good
fellow
said
the
minister
kindly
need
make
no
secret
of
resumed
daniel
questions
this
poor
little
creature
has
asked
me
have
gone
quicker
and
deeper
down
to
my
conscience
than
all
your
sermons
if
i
may
make
so
free
as
to
say
it
come
often
and
often
of
a
morning
and
looked
into
my
face
with
those
clear
eyes
of
hers
and
said
you
love
jesus
christ
daniel
it
make
you
very
glad
that
god
is
your
father
daniel
we
getting
nearer
heaven
every
day
daniel
and
one
day
says
she
you
going
to
give
all
your
money
to
god
daniel
ah
that
question
made
me
think
indeed
and
never
been
answered
till
this
day
while
been
sitting
beside
the
bed
here
counted
up
all
my
savings
it
is
and
said
all
thine
and
give
every
penny
of
it
rather
than
lose
the
child
if
it
be
thy
blessed
will
to
spare
her
voice
quavered
at
the
last
words
and
his
face
sank
upon
the
pillow
where
feeble
and
motionless
head
lay
there
was
a
very
sweet
yet
surprised
smile
upon
her
face
and
she
lifted
her
wasted
fingers
to
rest
upon
the
bowed
head
beside
her
while
she
shut
her
eyes
and
shaded
them
with
her
other
weak
hand
illustration
father
she
said
in
a
faint
whisper
which
still
reached
the
ears
of
the
minister
and
the
beadle
asked
you
to
let
me
come
home
to
heaven
but
if
daniel
wants
me
please
to
let
me
stay
a
little
longer
for
jesus
sake
for
some
minutes
after
prayer
there
was
a
deep
and
unbroken
silence
in
the
room
daniel
still
hiding
his
face
upon
the
pillow
and
the
minister
standing
beside
them
with
bowed
head
and
closed
eyes
as
if
he
also
were
praying
when
he
looked
up
again
at
the
forsaken
and
desolate
child
he
saw
that
her
feeble
hand
had
fallen
from
her
face
which
looked
full
of
rest
and
peace
while
her
breath
came
faintly
but
regularly
through
her
parted
lips
he
took
her
little
hand
into
his
own
with
a
pang
of
fear
and
grief
but
instead
of
the
mortal
chillness
of
death
he
felt
the
pleasant
warmth
and
moisture
of
life
he
touched
shoulder
and
as
he
lifted
up
his
head
in
sudden
alarm
he
whispered
to
him
child
is
not
dead
but
is
only
before
jessica
was
fully
recovered
daniel
rented
a
little
house
for
himself
and
his
adopted
daughter
to
dwell
in
he
made
many
inquiries
after
her
mother
but
she
never
appeared
again
in
her
old
haunts
and
he
was
well
pleased
that
there
was
nobody
to
interfere
with
his
charge
of
jessica
when
jessica
grew
strong
enough
many
a
cheerful
walk
had
they
together
in
the
early
mornings
as
they
wended
their
way
to
the
railway
bridge
where
the
little
girl
took
her
place
behind
the
stall
and
soon
learned
to
serve
the
daily
customers
and
many
a
happy
day
was
spent
in
helping
to
sweep
and
dust
the
chapel
into
which
she
had
crept
so
secretly
at
first
her
great
delight
being
to
attend
to
the
pulpit
and
the
vestry
and
the
pew
where
the
children
sat
while
daniel
and
the
woman
he
employed
cleaned
the
rest
of
the
building
many
a
sunday
also
the
minister
in
his
pulpit
and
his
little
daughters
in
their
pew
and
daniel
treading
softly
about
the
aisles
as
their
glance
fell
upon
eager
earnest
happy
face
thought
of
the
first
time
they
saw

among

great

it
was
a
gloomy
sunday
in
the
gloomiest
part
of
the
year
when
the
fog
hung
over
london
day
and
night
only
lifting
itself
off
a
little
for
two
or
three
hours
about
noon
time
the
bells
which
rang
from
the
church
towers
might
have
been
chiming
from
some
region
above
the
clouds
so
distant
they
sounded
and
so
hidden
were
the
belfries
in
which
they
hung
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
the
congregations
went
to
and
from
their
various
places
of
worship
with
a
feeling
of
sombre
depression
at
the
long
continuance
of
the
gloom
but
after
nightfall
the
darkness
was
only
natural
and
though
the
lamps
gave
but
little
light
and
shone
merely
like
yellow
balls
in
the
fog
the
passengers
in
the
street
moved
more
briskly
and
talked
more
cheerfully
than
in
the
morning
here
and
there
the
brilliantly
illuminated
windows
of
some
church
or
chapel
cast
a
pleasant
gleam
upon
the
pavement
and
the
open
doors
seemed
to
invite
any
cold
or
weary
to
enter
into
its
light
and
warmth
but
as
if
these
buildings
the
temples
of
god
were
designed
only
for
the
rich
and
for
those
who
had
comfort
enough
in
their
own
dwellings
it
was
noticeable
that
but
a
very
scanty
sprinkling
of
worshippers
dressed
in
vile
raiment
were
to
be
seen
among
the
congregations
though
there
was
no
lack
of
those
who
wore
goodly
apparel
and
gay
clothing
the
fashionable
chapel
of
which
daniel
standring
was
the
was
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
for
there
were
no
poor
to
be
found
in
it
there
was
within
it
every
appliance
of
comfort
and
style
such
as
could
give
satisfaction
to
a
wealthy
congregation
the
oak
pews
were
high
enough
for
the
head
of
an
occasional
slumberer
to
repose
in
quiet
indulgence
and
they
were
well
lined
and
carpeted
and
cushioned
the
shades
for
the
lamps
toned
down
their
light
to
a
clear
yet
soft
lustre
and
the
apparatus
for
heating
the
building
was
of
the
most
efficient
kind
the
crowds
who
flocked
to
hear
the
minister
were
increasing
every
sunday
and
daniel
standring
had
with
some
reluctance
yielded
to
the
necessity
of
sharing
his
office
of
with
a
colleague
a
man
however
of
less
dignity
and
solemnity
of
deportment
than
himself
and
who
was
quite
willing
to
look
up
to
him
as
a
superior
moreover
the
old
members
of
the
church
the
especially
recognized
him
only
as
their
and
entrusted
any
message
or
any
commission
to
him
alone
and
he
also
retained
the
charge
of
attending
upon
the
vestry
the
other
man
was
no
more
than
a
subordinate
and
after
a
while
he
was
reconciled
to
this
division
of
the
office
there
had
been
two
things
much
talked
about
among
the
people
for
some
time
past
the
first
that
the
minister
himself
should
have
a
colleague
found
for
him
and
the
second
that
a
large
and
still
more
fashionable
chapel
should
be
built
as
to
the
colleague
there
were
several
difficulties
in
the
way
the
chief
one
being
to
find
such
a
preacher
as
would
attract
the
same
congregations
as
those
which
came
in
crowds
to
listen
to
the
minister
for
it
was
found
that
whenever
it
was
known
that
he
would
be
absent
from
his
pulpit
the
numbers
dwindled
away
until
during
his
yearly
holiday
the
chapel
would
seem
almost
empty
compared
to
the
throng
of
curious
and
eager
listeners
who
hung
upon
his
words
and
scarcely
dared
to
sigh
over
his
representations
of
their
misery
and
peril
lest
they
should
miss
hearing
a
single
syllable
of
the
eloquence
which
described
it
still
every
member
of
the
congregation
said
it
was
essential
that
a
colleague
should
be
found
for
their
beloved
pastor
before
he
had
quite
worn
himself
out
and
great
blame
was
thrown
back
upon
the
small
provincial
church
which
years
ago
had
thrust
him
a
mere
youth
of
twenty
upon
the
exhausting
duties
of
the
ministry
as
for
the
second
subject
it
was
settled
without
much
difficulty
for
only
money
not
a
man
was
wanted
and
upon
the
vestry
table
there
was
a
already
promising
some
thousands
of
pounds
and
beside
it
lay
the
plans
for
the
new
chapel
drawn
up
by
an
eminent
architect
the
chapel
doors
had
been
opened
by
daniel
and
the
gas
toned
down
to
precisely
the
brilliance
and
softness
which
the
congregation
loved
especially
the
lamps
on
each
side
of
the
pulpit
which
shed
a
revealing
light
upon
the
thoughtful
face
and
upon
his
dark
hair
just
tinged
with
grey
in
the
vestry
jessica
had
just
given
a
final
and
delicate
stroke
of
dusting
and
was
wiping
the
large
pulpit
bible
and
with
her
clean
ready
for
daniel
to
carry
up
into
the
pulpit
while
the
organist
was
playing
the
opening
voluntary
which
he
did
with
so
solemn
and
ministerial
an
aspect
that
a
stranger
not
accustomed
to
the
etiquette
of
the
place
might
be
betrayed
into
the
supposition
that
he
was
the
minister
himself
daniel
was
waiting
now
in
the
porch
like
some
faithful
steward
ready
to
receive
his
guests
and
as
carriage
after
carriage
rolled
up
almost
a
smile
of
satisfaction
softened
his
rigid
features
the
children
had
passed
him
with
a
smile
and
a
nod
and
he
had
shut
the
door
of
their
pew
in
the
corner
so
he
knew
the
minister
was
come
and
putting
a
little
additional
briskness
in
his
manner
he
looked
out
for
seats
for
the
strangers
who
were
filling
the
aisles
at
the
same
time
listening
for
the
first
notes
of
the
organ
the
minister
had
entered
the
vestry
just
as
jessica
had
finished
wiping
the
imaginary
dust
off
the
bible
and
and
he
drew
his
chair
up
close
to
the
fire
as
if
coming
through
the
fog
had
chilled
him
he
looked
sad
and
downcast
and
his
head
sank
forward
upon
his
breast
for
a
minute
jessica
stood
behind
his
chair
in
silence
and
then
she
stretched
out
her
hand
a
small
thin
hand
still
and
laid
it
timidly
upon
his
arm
said
the
minister
covering
her
small
palm
with
his
scholarly
hand
am
sorrowful
and
i
have
great
heaviness
of
heart
tell
me
my
child
do
you
understand
what
i
preach
about
in
my
pulpit
no
no
answered
jessica
shaking
her
head
deprecatingly
when
you
say
god
and
jesus
christ
and
heaven
i
know
what
you
mean
by
you
said
the
minister
with
a
very
tender
smile
do
i
say
them
often
jessica
they
come
over
and
over
again
replied
jessica
then
i
feel
very
glad
because
i
know
what
you
are
preaching
about
there
is
always
god
in
your
sermon
but
sometimes
there
jesus
christ
and
what
do
i
mean
by
god
and
jesus
christ
and
heaven
he
asked
know
anything
but
what
taught
me
said
jessica
folding
her
brown
hands
meekly
over
one
another
told
me
that
god
is
the
father
of
our
souls
and
jesus
christ
is
our
elder
brother
who
came
down
from
heaven
to
save
us
and
heaven
is
the
home
of
god
where
we
shall
all
go
if
we
love
and
serve
him
i
know
any
more
than
is
enough
said
the
minister
lifting
up
his
head
with
a
brighter
look
soul
has
learned
the
truth
from
me
god
bless
you
jessica
and
keep
you
in
his
fear
and
love
for
as
he
spoke
the
deep
tones
of
the
organ
fell
upon
their
ears
and
the
vestry
door
was
opened
by
daniel
coming
for
the
pulpit
books
there
was
an
air
of
solemn
pride
upon
his
face
and
he
bowed
lower
than
usual
to
his
minister
a
vast
crush
of
people
sir
he
said
aisles
and
the
galleries
are
all
full
and
a
many
standing
at
the
door
yet
who
will
have
to
go
away
for
no
room
for
the
minister
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
shivered
with
the
cold
no
doubt
and
daniel
and
jessica
were
leaving
the
vestry
when
they
were
called
back
by
his
voice
speaking
in
husky
and
agitated
tones
he
said
have
something
of
importance
to
say
to
you
after
the
service
this
evening
so
come
back
here
as
soon
as
the
congregation
is
gone
and
jessica
take
care
to
sit
in
your
own
place
where
i
can
see
you
for
i
will
preach
about
jesus
christ
and
heaven
jessica
answered
only
by
a
little
nod
and
left
the
vestry
by
a
door
which
did
not
open
into
the
chapel
in
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
she
was
making
her
way
up
the
crowded
aisles
to
her
usual
seat
at
the
foot
of
the
pulpit
steps
where
with
her
head
thrown
back
her
face
lifted
itself
up
to
the
gaze
she
had
just
time
to
settle
herself
and
glance
at
the
children
who
were
looking
out
for
her
when
the
last
quiet
notes
of
the
organ
ceased
and
the
vestry
door
opened
the
minister
mounted
the
stairs
slowly
and
with
his
head
bent
down
but
as
soon
as
he
was
in
the
pulpit
he
looked
round
upon
the
faces
whose
eyes
were
all
fastened
upon
him
many
of
the
faces
he
knew
and
had
seen
thus
upraised
to
him
for
scores
of
sundays
and
his
eyes
passed
from
one
to
another
swiftly
but
with
a
distinguishing
regard
of
which
he
had
never
been
conscious
before
and
their
names
swept
across
his
memory
like
sudden
flashes
of
light
there
sat
his
own
children
and
his
eyes
rested
fondly
upon
them
as
they
looked
up
to
him
and
he
smiled
tenderly
to
himself
as
his
glance
caught
the
flushed
and
fervent
face
of
jessica
the
sermon
he
had
prepared
during
the
week
was
one
of
great
research
and
of
studied
oratory
which
should
hold
his
hearers
in
strained
and
breathless
attention
but
as
he
bowed
down
his
head
in
silent
supplication
for
the
blessing
of
god
he
said
to
himself
will
preach
to
this
people
from
the
saying
of
christ
calleth
his
own
sheep
by
name
and
leadeth
them
chapter
ii
only
a
stroke
the
first
part
of
the
service
passed
by
as
usual
disturbed
only
by
the
occasional
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
or
the
carefully
hushed
footstep
up
the
aisles
of
some
late
comer
and
the
moment
for
the
prayer
before
the
sermon
was
come
every
head
was
bent
and
a
deep
stillness
prevailed
which
grew
more
and
more
profound
as
the
voice
still
remained
silent
as
if
he
was
waiting
until
there
was
no
stir
or
rustle
or
movement
to
be
heard
throughout
the
congregation
there
was
something
awful
in
this
solemn
pause
before
his
voice
was
lifted
up
to
god
and
as
it
prolonged
itself
a
sigh
it
might
have
been
from
the
inmost
heart
was
heard
by
those
nearest
to
the
pulpit
one
or
two
looked
up
and
saw
his
head
bowed
down
with
the
softened
light
of
the
lamps
falling
upon
the
silvery
streaks
of
his
hair
and
they
dropped
their
faces
again
upon
their
hands
waiting
then
there
ran
a
thrill
and
a
shiver
through
all
the
congregation
and
here
and
there
a
sob
which
could
no
longer
be
repressed
broke
the
laboring
silence
after
that
there
were
whispers
and
murmurs
and
faces
lifted
up
with
a
vague
dread
upon
them
and
still
the
minister
did
not
raise
his
face
from
the
crimson
cushion
that
his
voice
might
allay
the
growing
agitation
his
children
were
looking
up
at
last
and
jessica
had
risen
from
her
knees
and
was
gazing
up
with
eager
eyes
to
his
drooping
head
there
was
a
stir
now
and
the
spell
of
silence
was
broken
while
jessica
forgetful
of
everything
but
her
deep
love
for
him
ran
swiftly
up
the
steps
and
touched
him
timidly
with
her
hand
the
minister
neither
spoke
nor
moved
the
great
congregation
was
in
a
tumult
instantly
standing
up
and
talking
and
crying
out
with
hysterical
sobs
and
pushing
out
of
their
pews
and
thronging
towards
the
pulpit
in
a
few
minutes
the
minister
was
carried
down
into
the
vestry
and
the
crowd
gathered
about
the
door
of
it
some
of
the
chief
men
belonging
to
the
chapel
urged
the
congregation
to
disperse
and
return
to
their
homes
but
they
were
too
much
excited
to
leave
before
it
was
known
what
had
befallen
the
minister
jessica
pushed
her
way
being
small
and
nimble
and
used
to
crowds
to
the
very
door
of
the
vestry
where
daniel
stood
to
guard
it
from
being
invaded
by
too
many
strangers
and
she
waited
there
beside
him
until
the
door
was
opened
by
a
and
a
physician
whispered
from
within
is
not
death
but
a
more
quickly
than
the
words
could
be
carried
from
lip
to
lip
among
the
crowd
jessica
glided
through
the
midst
to
the
pew
where
the
children
were
kneeling
with
arms
about
one
another
sobbing
out
inarticulate
prayers
to
god
she
stood
for
a
moment
beside
them
scarcely
knowing
what
to
say
and
then
she
fell
down
on
her
knees
by
winny
and
put
her
lips
close
to
her
ear
winny
she
said
with
a
trembling
voice
doctor
says
nothing
but
a
stroke
he
taken
with
death
miss
jane
only
a
the
children
started
up
eagerly
and
caught
hands
clinging
to
her
as
some
one
older
and
wiser
than
themselves
they
had
had
no
bitter
taste
of
troubles
before
this
for
their
mother
had
been
taken
from
them
before
they
were
old
enough
to
understand
their
loss
and
their
lives
had
been
tenderly
smoothed
and
cared
for
that
jessica
should
bring
them
some
intelligence
and
consolation
in
their
sudden
panic
of
dread
invested
her
with
a
kind
of
superiority
so
now
they
looked
to
her
as
one
who
could
help
and
counsel
them
is
a
stroke
jessica
asked
jane
looking
imploringly
towards
her
with
her
white
face
hardly
know
answered
jessica
know
what
strokes
used
to
be
when
i
lived
with
mother
but
this
is
different
miss
jane
this
stroke
comes
from
god
and
it
can
not
be
very
the
children
were
all
three
of
them
silent
after
jessica
had
spoken
but
each
one
of
them
was
gathering
comfort
and
strength
from
her
words
it
was
a
stroke
which
had
come
from
god
and
therefore
it
could
not
be
very
bad
no
one
had
seen
it
fall
no
one
had
known
that
the
hand
was
lifted
up
to
strike
and
it
had
come
down
softly
and
gently
only
hushing
the
voice
and
shutting
up
the
gateway
of
the
senses
now
that
it
was
known
the
chapel
was
gradually
emptying
as
the
congregation
went
away
and
jane
and
winny
feeling
calmed
and
strengthened
were
ready
to
listen
to
their
nurse
who
was
now
anxious
to
take
them
home
jessica
come
home
with
us
nurse
said
winny
who
still
held
hand
between
both
her
own
the
nurse
consented
willingly
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
walking
homewards
one
on
each
side
of
jessica
they
felt
strangely
bewildered
still
but
jessica
was
like
a
guide
to
them
leading
them
through
the
fog
and
over
the
slimy
crossings
with
familiar
confidence
until
they
reached
the
door
of
the
house
when
she
hung
back
shyly
as
if
not
meaning
to
go
in
with
them
leave
us
yet
cried
winny
impetuously
is
not
come
home
and
a
little
bit
afraid
you
afraid
jessica
answered
jessica
cheerfully
be
anything
dreadful
must
come
in
and
stay
with
us
said
jane
the
calm
sedateness
of
her
manner
a
little
shaken
by
her
fears
we
will
take
jessica
into
study
till
he
comes
the
three
children
went
quietly
up
stairs
to
the
study
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
which
was
burning
brightly
as
if
waiting
to
welcome
the
return
after
the
labors
of
the
day
the
minister
had
gathered
about
him
many
books
so
that
every
part
of
the
large
room
was
filled
with
them
on
the
table
lay
those
which
he
had
been
studying
during
the
week
while
he
was
preparing
his
elaborate
sermon
which
was
to
have
astonished
and
electrified
even
his
accustomed
hearers
and
upon
the
desk
there
were
scattered
about
the
slips
of
paper
upon
which
he
had
jotted
down
some
of
the
profound
thoughts
which
only
a
few
of
his
people
could
comprehend
but
upon
the
at
the
end
where
his
was
placed
and
close
to
his
hand
lay
a
small
so
worn
with
much
reading
that
there
was
no
book
in
his
study
like
it
the
troubled
children
sitting
on
the
hearth
knew
nothing
of
the
profound
and
scholarly
volumes
on
the
table
but
they
were
familiar
with
the
little
bible
and
winny
taking
it
in
her
hand
lifted
it
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
fondly
always
used
to
read
and
talk
to
us
on
a
sunday
night
after
we
had
come
home
she
said
sorrowfully
speaking
already
as
if
the
custom
was
one
long
past
which
could
never
be
resumed
a
stroke
last
long
jessica
inquired
jane
with
a
look
of
deep
anxiety
not
sure
answered
jessica
strokes
were
sharp
and
soon
over
but
the
smart
lasted
a
long
while
maybe
the
stroke
is
now
over
but
perhaps
the
smart
will
last
a
little
while
god
said
jane
the
tears
standing
in
her
eyes
god
knows
what
is
best
for
papa
and
us
known
that
a
long
time
but
now
we
must
believe
it
with
our
is
a
deal
harder
than
knowing
remarked
winny
with
a
look
wonderfully
like
her
and
the
three
children
were
silent
again
their
minds
full
of
thought
while
they
listened
for
the
return
to
his
home
chapter
iii
mother
they
were
heavy
steps
which
the
three
listening
children
heard
at
last
in
the
hall
below
and
upon
the
staircase
the
sounds
of
carrying
a
helpless
burden
up
the
stairs
and
jane
and
winny
pressed
closer
to
jessica
who
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
an
air
of
tender
encouragement
as
the
sounds
drew
near
they
crept
by
one
impulse
to
the
door
and
opening
it
a
little
way
they
saw
their
face
as
he
was
carried
past
them
pale
but
peaceful
with
the
eyelids
closed
as
if
he
were
in
a
deep
sleep
quick
eyes
detected
daniel
standing
in
the
darkness
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
as
soon
as
the
sad
procession
had
passed
into
the
chamber
and
the
door
was
shut
she
darted
out
and
led
him
eagerly
to
the
study
standring
cried
jane
and
winny
in
one
breath
us
everything
about
come
you
be
frightened
my
little
ladies
answered
daniel
soothingly
god
your
papa
will
be
all
right
again
in
a
week
or
two
the
doctors
say
been
studying
too
much
to
make
his
grand
sermons
and
he
given
his
brain
rest
enough
but
come
all
right
again
by
and
by
or
i
know
whatever
will
become
of
the
die
murmured
jane
with
quivering
lips
oh
no
said
daniel
my
dears
all
of
a
tremble
it
would
be
the
best
for
you
to
go
to
bed
for
you
do
any
good
sitting
said
winny
wish
let
jessica
stay
all
night
with
us
she
could
sleep
with
nurse
and
our
room
is
inside
and
if
we
leave
the
door
open
we
could
talk
to
one
may
stay
and
welcome
if
nurse
likes
miss
winny
answered
daniel
and
as
the
nurse
was
anxious
for
her
children
to
feel
their
new
sorrow
as
lightly
as
possible
she
was
glad
to
grant
their
request
so
after
a
while
it
happened
that
daniel
was
wending
his
way
alone
through
the
fog
and
the
damp
of
the
streets
towards
a
little
house
in
a
quiet
and
respectable
sort
of
court
where
for
the
last
three
years
he
had
dwelt
with
his
adopted
child
his
mind
had
been
fully
occupied
with
the
strange
events
of
the
night
and
the
paralysis
of
his
stricken
master
but
now
that
he
was
alone
and
his
thoughts
were
free
to
return
to
his
own
affairs
they
suddenly
recalled
to
him
the
last
words
to
himself
what
could
it
be
of
importance
that
he
had
to
say
to
him
when
the
evening
service
was
finished
his
brain
had
been
busy
with
guesses
in
spite
of
his
conscience
during
the
singing
of
the
hymns
and
even
during
the
first
prayer
when
he
stood
at
the
to
arrest
the
entrance
of
any
late
comer
until
it
should
be
ended
something
of
importance
and
now
the
minister
could
not
reveal
it
to
him
he
knew
that
at
a
private
committee
meeting
during
the
past
week
a
plan
had
been
proposed
for
erecting
a
small
residence
close
to
the
new
chapel
and
schoolrooms
where
the
might
dwell
and
it
had
been
suggested
that
his
salary
should
be
raised
to
such
a
sum
as
would
free
him
from
the
necessity
of
seeking
any
other
employment
in
fact
the
care
of
the
chapel
would
be
work
enough
for
it
was
to
be
very
large
and
magnificent
and
already
his
duties
filled
up
four
clear
days
of
the
week
could
it
be
to
speak
about
this
the
minister
had
desired
him
to
come
into
his
vestry
immediately
after
the
congregation
had
departed
but
it
was
not
so
much
the
business
as
that
of
the
chief
men
belonging
to
the
church
could
it
be
anything
about
jessica
it
did
not
seem
very
likely
yet
the
minister
was
very
partial
to
jessica
and
always
seemed
pleased
to
see
her
about
the
vestry
and
he
was
talking
to
her
very
kindly
when
daniel
went
to
fetch
the
pulpit
books
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
pacify
his
awakened
curiosity
and
he
supposed
nobody
could
satisfy
it
but
the
minister
himself
how
long
was
the
stroke
likely
to
last
daniel
was
asking
himself
this
question
which
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
could
answer
just
as
he
reached
the
door
of
his
dwelling
there
was
a
dim
light
from
a
lamp
at
the
entrance
of
the
court
and
there
was
the
red
gleam
of
his
own
fire
shining
upon
the
white
within
so
that
he
could
distinguish
pretty
plainly
the
figure
of
a
person
which
looked
more
like
a
heap
of
rags
crouching
upon
his
a
tattered
coat
was
tied
round
the
neck
by
the
sleeves
and
an
old
brimless
hat
was
drawn
over
the
back
of
the
head
but
the
tangled
hair
which
hung
in
ragged
locks
over
the
face
was
too
long
for
a
and
as
he
stooped
down
to
look
more
closely
it
was
certainly
a
face
which
was
turned
towards
him
come
he
said
no
business
here
you
know
so
better
get
up
and
go
home
you
belong
to
this
place
and
made
a
mistake
coming
here
this
is
my
he
had
his
key
in
his
hand
ready
to
let
himself
in
where
the
comfortable
fire
was
waiting
for
him
but
he
could
not
open
the
door
until
the
miserable
creature
had
moved
and
though
she
raised
herself
a
little
she
did
not
get
up
on
her
feet
belong
to
any
place
she
answered
suddenly
yet
fiercely
i
made
a
mistake
in
coming
here
daniel
standring
and
daniel
reeled
for
a
instant
as
if
he
had
been
struck
by
a
very
heavy
blow
he
had
long
ago
ceased
to
trouble
himself
about
mother
or
to
dread
her
reappearance
and
the
minister
had
assured
him
that
if
she
should
ever
return
to
claim
her
daughter
he
would
use
all
his
influence
to
protect
jessica
from
her
as
being
an
unfit
person
to
have
the
training
of
a
child
the
woman
was
standing
up
now
but
leaning
her
back
against
his
door
snapping
her
fingers
at
him
with
her
face
stretched
out
with
a
glare
of
angry
defiance
in
her
bright
eyes
which
sparkled
through
the
gloom
nearly
had
the
door
down
she
said
with
a
hoarse
laugh
all
your
neighbors
came
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
but
i
scared
them
in
again
the
police
himself
turned
tail
like
a
and
she
laughed
again
so
loud
that
the
quiet
court
seemed
to
ring
with
the
sound
and
a
door
or
two
was
cautiously
opened
and
daniel
saw
his
neighbors
peeping
out
all
of
them
decent
people
who
held
him
in
respect
as
the
of
so
fashionable
a
chapel
want
my
daughter
she
cried
in
high
shrill
notes
jessica
my
daughter
where
is
she
you
scoundrel
now
then
answered
daniel
emboldened
by
the
advance
of
two
or
three
of
the
men
who
came
up
to
form
a
flank
of
defence
or
resistance
behavior
do
jessica
here
so
better
take
yourself
off
i
give
her
up
to
you
if
she
was
here
but
she
here
and
an
end
of
the
woman
seated
herself
once
more
upon
the
sill
and
leaned
her
head
against
the
you
go
in
i
go
in
she
said
doggedly
if
i
stay
out
you
stay
out
i
want
my
it
was
an
embarrassing
position
for
daniel
he
did
not
like
to
resort
to
force
in
order
to
enter
his
house
for
several
reasons
first
and
chiefly
he
was
now
too
sincere
a
christian
to
choose
any
violent
or
ungentle
measures
but
besides
this
the
person
before
him
was
a
woman
and
the
mother
of
jessica
and
he
was
himself
in
a
softened
mood
from
the
excitement
and
sorrow
of
the
evening
he
stretched
out
his
arm
and
fitted
the
key
into
the
lock
but
before
he
turned
it
he
looked
as
closely
as
he
could
through
the
gloom
into
the
face
not
drunk
are
you
he
said
sup
nor
drop
has
passed
my
lips
she
answered
with
a
groan
of
suffering
well
come
in
said
daniel
you
too
brookes
if
you
please
not
myself
at
all
and
it
hearten
me
to
have
somebody
to
back
me
come
he
opened
the
door
into
a
comfortable
and
neat
room
where
everything
was
arranged
with
scrupulous
order
for
he
was
an
orderly
man
by
nature
and
jessica
had
already
the
thrifty
habits
of
a
housekeeper
the
fire
had
been
well
raked
over
with
small
coals
before
he
and
jessica
started
for
chapel
and
now
it
was
a
bank
of
glowing
embers
the
woman
tottered
across
to
the
hearth
and
flung
herself
into
they
could
see
now
how
wan
and
hollow
her
face
was
with
the
cheeks
fallen
in
and
the
burning
eyes
sunk
deep
into
the
head
while
as
she
stretched
out
her
thin
and
yellow
hands
over
the
fire
the
red
gleam
shone
through
them
the
poor
tatters
she
wore
were
limp
and
dank
with
fog
and
the
slippers
into
which
her
naked
feet
were
thrust
were
worn
out
at
the
toes
so
as
to
give
free
inlet
to
the
mud
of
the
pavement
daniel
regarded
her
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
and
he
then
passed
on
into
a
small
kitchen
at
the
back
and
returned
quickly
with
some
bread
and
cheese
and
some
coffee
which
he
warmed
up
in
a
little
saucepan
she
drank
the
coffee
eagerly
but
she
could
not
swallow
more
than
a
mouthful
or
two
of
the
bread
this
is
home
she
said
when
she
was
revived
a
little
a
very
comfortable
home
too
eh
but
a
lucky
mother
and
a
lucky
girl
will
she
be
in
standring
answered
daniel
shortly
i
can
make
myself
comfortable
she
said
with
a
laugh
which
made
daniel
shiver
dare
say
her
bed
is
softer
than
any
slept
on
of
late
last
night
i
slept
under
a
scaffolding
on
some
shavings
put
yourself
out
about
me
i
can
make
myself
you
can
not
stay
here
all
night
replied
daniel
decisively
why
not
she
rejoined
suppose
as
good
as
my
daughter
ah
never
be
the
woman
been
i
rode
in
my
carriage
once
man
i
can
tell
you
and
what
should
hinder
me
staying
a
night
or
a
week
or
a
month
in
your
paltry
little
house
no
no
not
see
my
back
i
promise
give
you
a
lodging
for
five
shillings
said
daniel
hastily
not
going
to
give
you
five
farthings
for
it
said
the
woman
settling
herself
in
his
with
an
air
of
impudent
defiance
home
is
my
home
if
you
turn
me
out
out
she
goes
with
daniel
drew
his
neighbor
aside
into
the
kitchen
where
he
consulted
with
him
in
whispers
while
he
kept
his
eye
upon
his
terrible
visitor
through
the
open
door
am
i
to
do
with
her
he
asked
have
her
stop
here
for
anything
jessica
is
staying
all
night
with
the
children
but
come
back
whatever
am
i
to
do
her
some
money
to
go
away
answered
brookes
and
after
a
little
hesitation
daniel
resolved
to
act
upon
his
advice
he
returned
into
his
comfortable
little
parlor
which
in
some
way
had
never
looked
even
to
himself
so
comfortable
and
pleasant
and
he
addressed
his
visitor
with
a
determined
and
resolute
aspect
he
said
you
go
away
peaceable
send
for
a
policeman
as
sure
as
the
of
chapel
i
want
to
be
violent
with
you
for
a
christian
man
but
i
know
that
a
christian
man
is
bound
to
give
you
a
lodging
in
his
own
house
i
should
rather
think
he
but
if
you
will
go
away
quiet
here
is
a
shilling
to
pay
for
a
bed
and
breakfast
elsewhere
all
i
can
do
or
say
that
or
the
the
woman
deliberated
for
a
few
minutes
looking
hard
into
face
but
there
was
no
sign
of
irresolution
or
relenting
upon
his
grave
features
and
at
last
she
raised
herself
slowly
and
weariedly
from
the
chair
and
dragged
her
feet
across
the
floor
towards
him
she
took
the
shilling
sullenly
from
his
hand
and
without
a
word
passed
into
the
cold
and
damp
of
the
streets
while
daniel
watched
her
unsteady
steps
down
the
court
with
a
feeling
of
relief
but
when
brookes
was
gone
and
the
door
was
locked
for
the
night
and
the
agreeable
warmth
of
the
glowing
fire
wrapped
round
him
he
could
not
keep
his
thoughts
from
wondering
where
the
wretched
woman
had
found
a
shelter
his
mind
also
looked
onwards
with
misgiving
to
the
future
which
lay
immediately
before
him
and
jessica
and
again
he
lamented
on
his
own
account
that
he
could
not
go
for
counsel
to
other
friend
the
minister
who
had
been
stricken
into
silence
and
unconsciousness
even
concerning
interests
still
nearer
and
dearer
to
his
heart
chapter
iv
choice
early
the
next
morning
daniel
went
to
the
house
half
hoping
that
he
should
hear
that
the
malady
of
the
night
before
had
been
only
a
temporary
insensibility
from
which
he
had
recovered
but
the
minister
lay
in
the
same
state
of
unconsciousness
and
showed
no
sign
of
returning
life
the
nurse
told
him
that
a
ragged
and
miserable
woman
who
called
herself
mother
had
seen
him
during
the
sunday
afternoon
and
held
a
long
conversation
with
him
after
which
he
had
ordered
some
food
to
be
given
her
in
the
kitchen
this
then
no
doubt
was
the
subject
upon
which
the
minister
wished
to
speak
to
daniel
and
the
latter
felt
more
than
ever
lost
in
doubt
as
to
what
he
ought
to
do
as
it
was
now
impossible
to
hear
the
advice
which
his
master
had
intended
to
give
to
him
he
walked
thoughtfully
towards
the
chapel
with
jessica
beside
him
scarcely
knowing
how
to
break
the
news
to
her
she
was
a
little
sad
and
less
talkative
than
usual
and
her
small
hand
was
thrust
lovingly
into
his
own
as
if
she
felt
that
it
was
needful
to
assure
herself
that
it
could
return
her
warm
grasp
when
they
opened
the
and
going
in
saw
all
the
confusion
which
bore
testimony
of
the
last
calamity
daniel
drew
the
child
closer
to
him
with
his
arm
and
bending
down
stiffly
kissed
her
uplifted
face
going
to
die
said
jessica
with
a
trembling
voice
is
only
resting
himself
the
doctor
says
and
then
he
will
know
us
again
and
speak
to
us
think
cried
daniel
in
a
mournful
amazement
he
should
have
spoken
thousands
and
thousands
of
words
ay
millions
and
i
scarce
gave
an
ear
to
them
and
now
almost
offer
a
golden
guinea
for
every
word
he
could
speak
to
me
ay
jessica
so
that
he
spoke
pretty
short
and
simple
give
a
guinea
a
word
if
he
could
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
you
want
him
to
say
something
particular
asked
jessica
very
particular
answered
daniel
you
ask
god
suggested
jessica
he
answered
doubtfully
course
i
could
but
then
no
direct
answer
which
i
mistake
my
mother
used
to
open
her
bible
and
take
the
first
words
she
set
her
eyes
on
for
answer
and
very
queer
answers
they
were
sometimes
not
good
enough
yet
to
expect
a
very
clear
answer
to
my
jessica
made
no
answer
for
mode
of
reasoning
was
a
little
obscure
to
her
but
she
set
to
work
to
put
the
scattered
chairs
in
order
while
daniel
looked
on
with
loving
but
troubled
eyes
he
said
trouble
like
to
talk
to
him
about
is
that
your
come
back
she
started
and
looked
at
him
with
great
eyes
of
amazement
and
terror
while
her
face
quivered
and
she
twitched
her
small
shoulders
a
little
as
if
already
shrinking
from
a
blow
but
the
expression
of
pain
and
fear
passed
away
quickly
and
though
her
face
was
pale
a
smile
came
upon
it
god
know
that
come
back
she
asked
there
was
no
need
for
daniel
to
answer
her
question
but
he
turned
it
over
and
over
again
in
his
own
mind
with
something
very
much
like
doubt
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
have
been
so
much
better
especially
at
this
crisis
for
mother
to
remain
absent
that
it
was
as
if
god
had
given
up
his
particular
providence
over
the
affairs
of
insignificant
people
like
himself
and
jessica
it
would
be
no
wonder
if
amid
all
the
affairs
of
the
hosts
of
angels
and
the
myriads
of
worlds
of
which
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
god
should
overlook
a
little
matter
like
the
tramping
to
and
fro
of
a
drunken
woman
it
was
a
saddening
thought
but
daniel
was
in
the
mood
to
cherish
it
you
know
where
mother
is
asked
jessica
deary
answered
daniel
gave
her
a
shilling
last
night
to
pay
for
her
lodging
and
breakfast
she
told
me
had
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
all
day
but
the
nurse
said
been
to
see
the
minister
yesterday
afternoon
and
had
a
good
meal
sure
to
come
sure
to
come
again
echoed
jessica
so
continued
daniel
and
me
have
agreed
better
stay
with
the
young
ladies
for
a
bit
out
of
the
way
like
till
i
can
see
how
i
can
settle
with
your
mother
be
glad
to
stay
with
miss
jane
and
winny
jessica
she
answered
her
face
quivering
again
as
if
she
could
scarcely
keep
herself
from
crying
like
to
see
my
your
mother
repeated
daniel
with
unfeigned
astonishment
for
jessica
my
mother
replied
jessica
the
lord
jesus
christ
had
a
mother
oh
like
to
see
her
again
and
tell
her
about
god
and
jesus
christ
and
heaven
perhaps
become
a
good
woman
she
could
control
herself
no
longer
and
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
before
the
chair
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
daniel
heard
that
amid
her
sobs
she
was
murmuring
some
prayer
to
god
for
her
mother
this
was
a
new
perplexity
that
jessica
should
wish
to
see
her
cruel
and
mother
but
there
was
something
in
it
which
he
could
neither
blame
nor
gainsay
he
would
rather
have
kept
jessica
in
safety
at
the
house
than
have
her
exposed
to
the
frequent
and
violent
visits
of
the
drunken
woman
to
his
own
little
dwelling
but
if
jessica
decided
otherwise
he
would
not
oppose
her
his
house
did
not
seem
the
same
place
without
her
presence
in
it
for
yourself
deary
he
said
very
gently
home
with
me
and
run
the
chance
of
your
mother
coming
again
soon
or
go
back
to
miss
jane
and
winny
who
are
so
fond
of
you
and
where
everything
is
fine
and
be
in
such
good
company
choose
for
go
home
with
you
said
jessica
getting
up
from
her
knees
with
a
cheerful
smile
think
this
morning
sweep
the
kitchen
and
get
the
breakfast
rather
go
home
with
you
if
you
it
was
impossible
for
daniel
not
to
be
gratified
at
choice
however
troubled
he
might
be
with
the
idea
of
her
disturbance
of
their
peace
for
home
was
not
home
without
her
they
kept
very
near
to
one
another
all
day
at
their
work
and
it
was
late
at
night
before
they
returned
home
where
they
found
no
one
sitting
upon
the
doorsteps
as
daniel
timorously
expected
but
their
neighbor
brookes
informed
them
that
mother
had
been
sobbing
and
crying
before
the
closed
door
during
a
great
part
of
the
evening
chapter
how
a
christian
ought
to
act
daniel
was
very
anxious
that
jessica
should
not
be
exposed
to
her
violence
at
any
time
during
his
absence
when
he
would
not
be
there
to
protect
her
from
any
and
as
he
was
almost
constantly
engaged
with
the
chapel
affairs
for
the
next
two
or
three
days
he
and
jessica
were
never
at
home
until
late
in
the
evening
but
upon
thursday
night
as
they
turned
into
the
court
quick
eye
saw
a
figure
leaning
against
the
of
their
house
she
stood
still
for
an
instant
clasping
hand
with
close
and
timid
grasp
and
then
quitting
him
she
ran
forward
and
stretching
out
both
her
hands
almost
as
if
she
wished
to
throw
herself
into
her
arms
she
cried
mother
the
woman
laughed
loudly
and
shrilly
and
flung
her
shriveled
arms
about
jessica
fondling
her
with
a
maudlin
fondness
jessica
drew
back
sorrowfully
and
lifted
herself
on
to
whisper
into
ear
a
little
drunk
you
know
she
said
she
very
bad
yet
she
furious
what
shall
we
do
it
was
precisely
the
question
daniel
was
asking
of
himself
for
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
taking
a
drunken
woman
into
his
respectable
and
orderly
house
and
yet
could
he
turn
out
mother
before
eyes
he
paused
for
some
minutes
before
unlocking
the
door
while
the
woman
continued
to
talk
in
a
foolish
strain
to
her
child
but
at
last
he
felt
compelled
to
open
it
and
she
was
the
first
to
push
her
way
in
she
took
possession
again
of
his
and
tossed
her
old
tattered
hat
into
a
corner
of
the
room
while
he
looked
on
in
helpless
and
deep
dismay
said
jessica
speaking
to
her
in
gentle
but
steady
tones
your
house
at
all
and
you
stay
here
house
but
i
dare
say
let
me
give
you
some
supper
and
then
better
go
away
and
come
to
see
me
again
when
quite
the
woman
fastened
her
red
and
sunken
eyes
upon
jessica
and
then
burst
into
a
fit
of
passionate
lamenting
while
she
drew
the
child
closer
to
her
i
wish
i
was
a
better
woman
she
cried
been
driven
to
it
jessica
but
coming
to
live
here
with
you
now
and
be
decent
like
the
rest
of
you
going
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
see
how
steady
be
be
no
disgrace
to
any
of
mother
said
jessica
live
here
because
house
and
he
only
took
me
out
of
charity
when
i
was
ill
and
you
left
me
we
look
for
him
to
take
you
stay
i
stay
said
her
mother
in
a
tone
of
obstinacy
setting
her
elbows
firmly
upon
the
arms
of
the
chair
and
planting
her
feet
on
the
floor
if
i
go
you
go
like
to
know
have
the
heart
to
separate
a
mother
from
her
own
child
jessica
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
looking
at
her
mother
with
eyes
full
of
sadness
and
pity
and
then
she
crept
to
side
and
whispered
to
him
with
an
air
of
pleading
think
she
ever
knew
that
god
is
our
father
she
said
daniel
found
himself
at
a
complete
loss
as
to
what
he
ought
to
do
the
miserable
creature
before
him
shocked
every
sense
of
decency
and
propriety
which
had
been
firmly
and
rigidly
rooted
in
his
nature
and
the
very
sight
of
her
drunken
and
disorderly
upon
his
hearth
was
an
abomination
to
him
since
she
had
last
spoken
she
had
fallen
into
a
brief
slumber
and
her
grey
uncovered
head
was
shaking
and
nodding
with
an
imbecile
aspect
jessica
was
going
upstairs
for
what
he
did
not
know
unless
it
was
to
make
some
arrangement
for
her
accommodation
and
he
remained
motionless
staring
at
the
wretched
woman
with
a
feeling
of
abhorrence
and
disgust
which
increased
every
moment
but
presently
he
heard
light
steps
descending
the
stairs
and
started
with
surprise
when
she
came
into
the
room
she
had
changed
her
tidy
dress
for
the
poorest
and
oldest
clothing
in
her
possession
and
she
approached
him
with
a
sorrowful
but
patient
look
upon
her
face
daniel
she
said
unconsciously
falling
back
into
speaking
the
old
name
by
which
she
had
first
called
him
go
to
take
mother
in
out
of
charity
as
well
as
me
that
never
do
so
go
away
with
her
and
in
the
morning
when
sober
tell
her
all
about
god
and
jesus
christ
and
heaven
she
know
it
yet
but
maybe
when
she
hears
every
thing
be
a
different
woman
like
me
you
know
and
then
we
can
all
help
her
to
be
good
only
i
must
go
away
with
her
or
get
into
a
raging
fury
like
she
used
to
no
no
cried
daniel
vehemently
let
you
go
dear
why
jessica
i
love
you
more
than
my
money
i
god
knows
i
love
you
better
rather
lose
all
my
money
ay
and
my
place
as
than
lose
going
to
lose
me
said
jessica
with
the
same
patient
but
sorrowful
light
in
her
eyes
only
going
away
for
a
little
while
with
my
mother
my
mother
and
i
want
to
tell
her
all
i
know
that
she
may
go
to
heaven
as
well
as
us
come
back
shall
stay
here
said
daniel
hesitatingly
no
answered
jessica
never
do
be
for
stopping
always
if
you
give
in
once
better
let
me
go
with
her
this
one
night
and
morning
when
all
right
tell
her
everything
be
very
low
then
and
hearken
to
me
mother
ready
to
go
with
the
woman
opened
her
swollen
eyelids
and
staggered
to
her
feet
laying
her
hand
heavily
upon
the
slight
shoulder
of
jessica
who
looked
from
her
to
daniel
with
a
clear
sad
brave
smile
as
she
bent
her
childish
shoulders
a
little
under
her
hand
as
if
they
felt
already
the
heavy
burden
that
was
falling
upon
her
life
it
was
a
hard
moment
for
daniel
and
he
was
yet
doubtful
whether
he
should
let
them
both
go
or
keep
them
both
but
jessica
had
led
her
mother
to
the
door
and
already
her
hand
was
upon
the
latch
a
minute
jessica
he
said
let
you
go
with
her
this
once
only
a
not
far
off
and
come
with
you
and
see
you
safe
for
the
night
and
pay
your
right
answered
jessica
with
a
quick
sagacious
nod
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
walking
along
the
streets
jessica
between
her
mother
and
daniel
all
of
them
very
silent
except
when
the
woman
broke
out
into
a
stave
or
two
of
some
old
song
before
long
they
reached
the
of
which
daniel
had
spoken
and
he
saw
them
safely
into
the
little
close
dark
closet
which
was
to
be
their
bedroom
said
daniel
kissing
jessica
with
more
than
usual
tenderness
feel
as
if
like
to
come
back
with
me
now
seen
your
mother
comfortable
do
you
answered
jessica
with
a
wistful
look
from
him
to
her
mother
who
had
thrown
herself
upon
the
bed
and
was
fast
asleep
already
think
doing
what
god
would
like
me
to
do
i
he
knows
she
is
my
god
bless
you
my
dear
said
daniel
turning
away
quickly
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
he
stumbled
down
the
dark
stairs
into
the
street
and
returned
to
his
desolate
home
saying
to
himself
sure
i
know
how
a
christian
ought
to
act
in
this
case
and
nobody
to
go
and
ask
chapter
vi
prayer
the
two
following
days
friday
and
saturday
were
always
a
busy
time
at
the
chapel
for
the
whole
place
had
to
be
swept
and
dusted
in
preparation
for
the
coming
sunday
never
had
daniel
felt
so
depressed
and
downhearted
as
when
he
entered
the
chilly
and
empty
chapel
early
in
the
morning
and
alone
for
jessica
was
to
follow
him
by
and
by
when
her
mother
had
strolled
away
for
the
day
to
her
old
haunts
only
a
week
ago
he
and
jessica
had
gone
cheerfully
about
their
work
together
blithe
clear
young
voice
echoing
through
the
place
as
she
sang
to
herself
or
called
to
him
from
some
pew
or
down
from
the
gallery
but
now
everything
was
upset
and
in
confusion
he
mounted
the
pulpit
steps
and
after
shaking
the
cushions
and
dusting
every
ledge
and
crevice
he
stood
upright
in
a
strange
and
solemn
reverie
as
he
looked
round
upon
the
empty
pews
which
were
wont
to
be
so
crowded
on
a
sunday
it
would
make
a
wonderful
difference
to
the
place
he
thought
if
anything
worse
should
happen
to
his
master
for
even
to
himself
daniel
could
not
bear
to
say
the
sad
word
death
they
could
never
find
his
like
again
never
he
repeated
laying
his
hand
reverently
upon
the
crimson
cushion
where
the
grey
head
had
sunk
in
sudden
dumbness
before
god
and
two
large
solemn
tears
forced
themselves
into
eyes
and
rolled
slowly
down
his
cheeks
he
did
not
know
who
ever
would
fill
the
pulpit
even
on
the
coming
sabbath
but
he
felt
that
he
could
never
bear
to
stay
at
the
chapel
after
its
glory
was
departed
and
see
the
congregation
dwindling
down
and
growing
more
and
more
scanty
every
week
until
only
a
few
drowsy
hearers
came
to
listen
sleepily
to
a
lifeless
preacher
no
no
that
would
go
a
good
way
towards
breaking
his
heart
besides
all
this
how
he
longed
to
be
able
to
ask
the
minister
what
he
ought
to
do
about
mother
but
whether
for
instruction
in
the
pulpit
or
for
counsel
in
private
the
voice
was
hushed
and
heart
was
not
a
whit
lighter
as
he
slowly
descended
the
pulpit
steps
it
was
getting
on
for
noon
before
jessica
followed
him
bringing
his
dinner
with
her
in
a
little
basket
her
eyes
were
red
with
tears
and
she
was
very
quiet
while
he
ate
with
a
poor
appetite
the
food
she
set
before
him
he
felt
reluctant
to
ask
after
her
mother
but
when
the
meal
was
finished
jessica
drew
near
to
him
and
took
hold
of
his
hand
in
both
her
own
daniel
she
said
very
sorrowfully
mother
awoke
this
morning
i
told
her
everything
about
jesus
christ
and
god
and
heaven
and
she
knew
it
all
before
before
i
was
born
she
said
ejaculated
daniel
but
not
in
a
tone
of
surprise
only
because
jessica
paused
and
looked
mournfully
into
his
face
continued
jessica
shaking
her
head
hopelessly
knew
about
it
and
she
never
told
me
never
she
never
spoke
of
god
at
all
only
when
she
was
cursing
i
know
now
anything
make
her
a
good
woman
i
thought
that
if
she
only
heard
what
i
said
love
god
but
she
only
laughed
at
me
and
said
an
old
story
i
know
what
can
be
done
for
her
tears
were
falling
fast
again
and
daniel
did
not
know
how
to
comfort
her
there
was
little
hope
he
knew
of
a
woman
so
enslaved
by
drunkenness
being
brought
back
again
to
religion
and
god
the
minister
could
only
see
her
said
jessica
speaks
as
if
he
had
seen
god
and
talked
to
him
sometimes
and
be
sure
to
believe
him
i
know
how
to
say
the
right
no
answered
daniel
saw
him
on
sunday
before
he
had
the
stroke
and
he
talked
a
long
time
to
her
no
she
be
changed
by
my
mother
you
know
repeated
jessica
anxiously
said
daniel
that
puzzles
me
jessica
i
know
what
to
we
pray
to
god
suggested
jessica
again
before
we
go
on
any
farther
it
would
be
the
best
thing
to
do
agreed
daniel
rising
from
his
chair
and
kneeling
down
with
jessica
beside
him
at
first
he
attempted
to
pray
like
some
of
the
at
the
weekly
in
set
and
formal
phrases
but
he
felt
that
if
he
wished
to
obtain
any
real
blessing
he
must
ask
for
it
in
simple
and
childlike
words
as
if
speaking
face
to
face
with
his
heavenly
father
and
this
was
the
prayer
he
made
after
freeing
himself
from
the
ceremonial
etiquette
of
the
thou
knowest
that
mother
is
come
back
and
what
a
drunken
and
disorderly
woman
she
is
and
we
know
what
to
do
with
her
and
the
minister
can
not
give
us
his
advice
sometimes
afraid
i
love
my
money
too
much
yet
but
lord
if
that
or
anything
else
hard
in
my
heart
so
as
to
hinder
me
from
doing
what
the
saviour
jesus
christ
would
do
if
he
was
in
my
place
i
pray
thee
to
take
it
away
and
make
me
see
clearly
what
my
christian
duty
is
dear
lord
i
beseech
thee
keep
both
me
and
jessica
from
daniel
rose
from
his
knees
a
good
deal
relieved
and
lightened
in
spirit
he
had
simply
with
the
heart
of
a
child
laid
his
petition
before
god
and
now
he
felt
that
it
was
part
to
direct
him
jessica
herself
seemed
brighter
for
if
the
matter
had
been
laid
in
hands
she
felt
that
it
was
certain
to
come
out
all
right
in
the
end
they
went
back
to
their
work
in
the
chapel
and
though
it
was
melancholy
to
remember
that
their
own
minister
would
be
absent
from
the
pulpit
on
the
sunday
which
was
drawing
near
they
felt
satisfied
with
the
thought
that
god
knew
all
and
was
making
all
things
work
together
for
the
good
of
those
who
loved
him
chapter
vii
a
busy
day
for
daniel
daniel
went
home
with
jessica
still
disturbed
a
little
with
the
dread
of
finding
his
unwelcome
visitor
awaiting
their
arrival
but
she
was
not
there
and
there
was
no
interruption
to
their
quiet
evening
together
though
both
of
them
started
and
looked
towards
the
door
at
every
sound
of
a
footstep
in
the
court
after
they
had
had
their
tea
and
while
jessica
was
putting
away
the
in
the
kitchen
daniel
unlocked
his
desk
and
took
out
his
receipts
for
the
money
he
had
out
on
interest
since
he
had
adopted
jessica
he
had
not
added
much
to
his
savings
for
besides
the
cost
of
her
maintenance
there
had
also
been
the
expenses
of
housekeeping
in
former
times
he
had
scarcely
cared
how
uncomfortable
his
lodgings
were
provided
that
they
were
cheap
and
he
had
found
that
to
have
a
tidy
and
comfortable
house
of
his
own
involved
a
great
outlay
of
money
sometimes
a
thought
had
crossed
his
mind
of
which
he
was
secretly
ashamed
that
the
minister
who
seemed
so
fond
of
jessica
or
at
least
some
of
the
rich
members
of
the
congregation
might
have
borne
part
of
the
charge
of
her
living
but
no
one
had
ever
offered
to
do
anything
for
her
he
had
spent
his
money
with
a
half
grudge
and
now
the
question
upon
his
mind
was
did
god
require
him
to
waste
he
said
to
himself
his
savings
upon
a
drunken
and
wicked
woman
it
was
a
hard
trial
he
loved
jessica
as
he
had
said
more
than
his
money
and
had
never
really
regretted
taking
her
into
his
home
she
was
like
a
daughter
to
him
and
he
was
a
happier
and
a
better
man
for
her
companionship
but
this
woman
was
an
abhorrence
to
him
a
disgust
and
disgrace
she
had
no
more
claim
upon
him
than
any
other
of
the
thousands
of
lost
men
and
women
who
thronged
the
streets
of
london
surely
god
did
not
require
him
to
take
this
money
which
was
the
sole
provision
for
his
old
age
and
now
that
the
minister
was
so
stricken
there
would
be
no
new
chapel
built
for
him
and
no
house
for
the
and
no
increase
of
salary
that
was
already
a
settled
point
for
the
physicians
who
were
attending
the
minister
declared
positively
that
never
again
would
his
brain
be
capable
of
sustaining
any
long
strain
of
thought
such
as
had
drawn
together
his
eager
and
attentive
congregations
it
was
scarcely
even
a
question
whether
he
would
be
able
to
resume
his
position
as
pastor
of
this
old
church
and
under
a
new
minister
it
was
probable
the
place
might
be
half
emptied
and
his
emoluments
as
be
considerably
lessened
he
was
getting
older
too
and
there
was
not
more
than
ten
work
in
him
he
looked
at
his
treasured
receipts
and
asked
himself
could
it
be
possible
that
god
required
him
to
sacrifice
his
past
gains
and
risk
his
future
comforts
upon
mother
then
another
question
in
the
very
depths
of
his
conscience
was
whispered
to
his
heart
which
at
first
was
willing
to
remain
deaf
to
the
small
and
quiet
voice
but
it
grew
louder
and
more
clamorous
until
daniel
found
that
it
must
be
heard
and
answered
think
you
christ
would
have
done
with
this
woman
it
asked
if
god
had
brought
her
to
that
door
where
he
dwelt
as
a
poor
carpenter
would
he
have
thrust
her
back
upon
the
misery
of
the
life
which
drove
her
again
and
again
to
the
vilest
of
her
sins
would
jesus
who
came
to
seek
as
well
as
to
save
those
who
are
lost
have
balanced
a
book
of
savings
against
the
hope
faint
though
it
was
of
rescuing
the
soul
daniel
answered
the
quiet
voice
to
his
inmost
heart
would
thy
lord
have
done
he
tried
to
set
it
aside
and
hush
it
up
while
he
turned
the
key
upon
his
receipts
telling
himself
that
he
had
done
all
that
his
duty
as
a
christian
demanded
of
him
when
he
rescued
and
adopted
jessica
but
the
spirit
of
god
has
a
gracious
tyranny
which
requires
more
and
more
from
the
soul
which
begins
to
sacrifice
itself
he
had
mastered
his
love
of
money
for
the
sake
of
a
child
whom
he
loved
now
he
must
conquer
it
to
rescue
a
wretched
woman
whom
he
shrank
from
the
struggle
seemed
to
last
long
but
it
was
ended
before
jessica
came
back
to
the
fireside
prayer
in
the
afternoon
had
been
too
sincere
for
him
to
be
left
in
darkness
to
grope
along
a
wrong
path
his
face
wore
a
smile
as
jessica
took
her
sewing
and
sat
down
opposite
to
him
such
a
smile
as
rarely
lit
up
his
rigid
features
he
said
has
shown
me
what
to
be
better
than
the
minister
himself
answered
jessica
answered
daniel
think
the
minister
could
have
told
me
plainer
why
jessica
suppose
the
lord
had
been
living
here
and
your
mother
had
come
to
his
door
he
have
cared
for
her
and
grieved
over
her
and
done
everything
he
could
to
prevent
her
going
on
in
sin
well
dear
it
seems
to
me
it
be
altogether
right
to
take
her
to
live
with
us
all
at
once
because
you
are
a
young
girl
and
ought
not
to
see
such
ways
and
i
might
get
angry
with
her
but
hire
a
room
for
her
somewhere
that
shall
be
always
kept
for
her
and
whenever
she
comes
to
it
there
will
be
a
bed
and
a
meal
for
her
and
be
very
kind
to
her
and
see
if
by
any
means
we
can
help
to
make
her
jessica
had
dropped
her
sewing
and
drawn
near
to
daniel
and
now
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
hid
her
face
upon
his
breast
crying
now
now
my
dear
said
daniel
ails
you
jessica
the
lord
jesus
have
made
a
plan
something
like
that
come
come
pray
to
him
to
make
her
a
good
woman
and
then
who
knows
she
may
come
here
to
live
with
my
own
mother
you
know
sobbed
jessica
as
if
these
words
alone
were
thoughts
in
her
heart
answered
daniel
we
must
do
our
best
for
her
jessica
i
know
now
that
i
love
god
more
than
aught
else
in
this
world
or
the
it
was
a
knowledge
worth
more
than
all
the
riches
of
earth
and
as
daniel
sat
in
his
he
could
hardly
realize
his
own
happiness
to
be
sure
that
he
loved
god
supremely
and
to
have
the
witness
in
himself
that
he
did
so
he
felt
as
if
he
could
take
all
the
world
of
lost
and
ruined
sinners
to
his
heart
and
like
christ
himself
lay
down
his
life
for
them
there
was
only
one
shadow
if
it
could
be
called
a
shadow
upon
his
joy
unspeakable
and
full
of
comfort
it
was
that
he
could
not
gladden
the
heart
of
the
minister
by
telling
him
of
this
change
in
his
nature
the
next
day
was
a
very
busy
one
for
daniel
for
besides
his
ordinary
duties
he
charged
himself
with
finding
a
suitable
place
for
mother
he
met
with
a
room
at
last
in
the
dwelling
of
a
poor
widow
who
was
glad
to
let
him
have
it
on
condition
that
he
paid
the
rent
of
the
house
he
and
jessica
bought
a
bed
and
a
chair
and
a
table
and
put
everything
in
readiness
for
their
expected
visitor
scanty
as
was
the
furniture
it
was
a
warm
and
certain
shelter
for
the
poor
vagrant
who
spent
half
her
nights
shivering
under
archways
or
in
unfinished
buildings
and
never
had
daniel
felt
so
pure
a
gratification
as
when
he
gave
a
last
look
at
the
room
and
taking
jessica
by
the
hand
went
back
to
his
own
home
no
longer
afraid
of
meeting
the
woman
on
his
threshold
chapter
viii
hopes
of
recovery
it
was
a
happy
sunday
for
daniel
in
spite
of
the
absence
and
the
downcast
looks
of
the
congregation
as
they
occupied
their
accustomed
seats
the
chapters
read
out
of
the
bible
had
new
meaning
for
him
and
the
singing
brought
happy
tears
to
his
eyes
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
never
truly
known
god
before
and
though
the
sermon
by
a
student
merely
was
one
which
he
would
have
criticised
with
contempt
a
week
ago
now
it
was
pleasant
only
to
hear
the
names
of
his
god
and
saviour
just
as
one
is
pleased
to
hear
even
a
stammering
tongue
speak
the
praises
of
those
we
love
during
the
evening
service
jessica
went
to
stay
with
the
children
jane
came
down
to
her
in
the
hall
and
told
her
they
were
to
sit
in
their
room
while
the
strange
nurse
and
their
own
nurse
were
having
tea
together
in
an
adjoining
room
thinks
said
jane
if
papa
knew
he
would
like
us
to
sit
with
him
this
sunday
evening
and
sometimes
we
think
he
does
know
though
he
never
speaks
and
he
seems
to
be
asleep
all
the
time
we
are
to
read
our
chapter
and
say
our
hymns
just
as
if
he
could
hear
and
nurse
says
he
told
your
mother
only
last
sunday
that
he
loves
you
almost
like
one
of
his
own
little
girls
so
we
said
we
should
like
you
to
come
and
read
with
us
for
you
are
not
a
bit
afraid
they
had
mounted
the
stairs
while
jane
was
whispering
these
sentences
and
now
hand
in
hand
they
entered
the
room
there
was
a
fire
burning
and
a
lamp
lit
upon
a
table
so
that
the
face
could
be
plainly
seen
as
they
stole
with
tender
caution
to
his
side
it
had
been
a
pale
face
always
but
it
was
very
colorless
now
the
lids
were
closed
lightly
over
the
eyeballs
which
seemed
almost
to
burn
and
shine
through
them
and
the
lips
which
might
have
been
speaking
words
that
seemed
to
bring
his
listeners
almost
into
the
presence
of
god
were
locked
in
silence
yet
the
face
was
full
of
life
which
rippled
underneath
as
it
were
as
if
the
colorless
cheeks
and
thin
eyelids
and
furrowed
forehead
were
only
a
light
mask
and
while
the
children
gazed
upon
it
the
lips
moved
slowly
but
soundlessly
is
talking
to
god
whispered
jessica
in
a
tone
of
awe
said
winny
pressing
close
to
her
help
thinking
about
paul
when
he
was
caught
up
into
the
third
heaven
and
heard
unspeakable
words
i
think
perhaps
he
looked
like
my
she
had
never
called
him
father
before
and
she
uttered
it
in
a
strangely
solemn
voice
as
if
it
was
a
more
fitting
title
than
the
familiar
one
they
had
called
him
by
on
ordinary
days
they
stood
beside
him
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
they
crept
on
tiptoe
across
to
the
hearth
the
children
read
their
chapter
and
said
their
hymns
and
sang
a
favorite
one
of
their
in
soft
low
tones
which
could
scarcely
have
been
heard
outside
the
room
and
the
little
timepiece
over
the
fireplace
chimed
seven
as
they
finished
was
just
this
time
last
sunday
said
jane
papa
had
the
stroke
he
was
just
going
to
pray
when
the
struck
wonder
what
he
was
going
to
say
said
winny
sorrowfully
father
murmured
a
voice
behind
them
very
low
and
weak
like
the
voice
of
one
who
has
only
strength
to
utter
a
single
cry
and
turning
quickly
with
a
feeling
of
fear
they
saw
their
eyes
opened
and
looking
towards
them
with
inexpressible
tenderness
jessica
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
as
a
sign
to
them
to
be
still
and
with
timid
courage
she
went
to
the
side
you
know
us
again
she
asked
trembling
between
fear
and
joy
you
know
who
we
are
minister
and
my
children
he
whispered
with
a
feeble
smile
fluttering
upon
his
face
is
come
back
cried
jessica
returning
with
swift
but
noiseless
steps
to
jane
and
winny
us
make
haste
and
tell
the
others
maybe
he
is
hungry
and
weak
and
faint
but
he
knows
us
he
is
come
back
to
us
in
a
few
minutes
the
joyful
news
was
known
throughout
the
house
and
was
carried
to
the
chapel
before
the
evening
service
was
over
and
the
congregation
as
they
dispersed
spoke
hopefully
of
the
recovery
it
was
the
crowning
gladness
of
the
day
to
daniel
and
he
lingered
at
the
house
to
which
he
hastened
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
chapel
until
it
was
getting
on
for
midnight
and
then
he
left
jessica
with
the
children
and
started
off
for
his
home
with
a
heart
in
which
joy
was
full
chapter
ix
the
gate
of
death
daniel
had
a
good
way
to
go
for
the
house
was
in
an
opposite
direction
to
his
own
from
the
chapel
the
november
fogs
still
hung
about
london
and
the
lamps
gave
only
a
dim
light
through
the
gloom
those
who
were
yet
walking
about
the
streets
marched
quickly
as
if
anxious
to
reach
whatever
shelter
they
called
their
own
daniel
himself
was
making
his
way
as
fast
as
he
could
along
the
muddy
pavement
when
he
came
to
a
part
of
the
streets
where
the
drainage
was
being
repaired
and
where
charcoal
fires
were
burning
in
braziers
here
and
there
at
once
to
give
warning
to
the
and
to
afford
warmth
to
the
watchmen
who
stayed
beside
them
all
night
one
of
the
watchmen
had
brought
an
old
door
and
reared
it
up
against
a
rude
wall
of
stone
and
bricks
so
as
to
form
some
protection
from
the
rain
which
now
and
then
fell
in
short
showers
he
had
quitted
his
shed
for
some
reason
or
other
and
as
daniel
drew
near
his
steps
were
arrested
for
crouching
underneath
it
and
stretching
out
her
shrivelled
arms
over
the
brazier
full
of
charcoal
was
mother
the
fitful
light
was
shining
strongly
upon
her
face
and
showed
the
deep
lines
which
misery
and
degradation
had
ploughed
upon
it
and
the
sullenness
and
stupidity
which
were
stamped
upon
her
features
he
stood
still
gazing
at
her
with
disgust
but
very
soon
a
feeling
of
profound
pity
took
its
place
he
had
been
wondering
what
had
become
of
her
since
friday
morning
and
had
even
felt
a
kind
of
anxiety
about
her
and
now
as
he
thought
of
the
room
with
its
comfortable
bed
which
was
waiting
for
her
instead
of
the
brief
shelter
of
the
shed
he
climbed
over
the
heaps
of
rubbish
which
lay
between
them
calling
to
her
for
he
did
not
know
her
name
mother
the
woman
started
to
her
feet
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
with
an
expression
of
utter
wretchedness
her
eyes
were
inflamed
and
swollen
with
tears
and
every
feature
was
quivering
as
if
she
had
no
control
over
them
she
was
so
miserable
a
creature
that
daniel
did
not
know
in
what
words
to
speak
to
her
but
his
heart
was
moved
with
an
unutterable
compassion
unknown
to
him
till
now
he
even
felt
a
sympathy
for
her
as
if
he
had
once
been
in
the
same
depths
of
degradation
as
he
looked
down
shudderingly
into
the
deep
abyss
where
she
had
fallen
by
her
sins
and
the
sense
of
her
misery
touched
him
so
closely
that
he
would
have
given
his
life
for
her
salvation
he
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
her
but
she
pushed
it
away
and
with
a
groan
of
despair
she
fled
from
the
light
and
sought
to
hide
herself
in
the
darkness
of
the
foggy
streets
but
daniel
was
not
easily
turned
aside
from
his
desire
to
bring
some
help
to
mother
even
if
it
were
no
more
than
to
rescue
her
from
the
chilliness
of
the
november
night
he
followed
her
with
steps
as
rapid
as
her
own
and
only
that
she
had
the
first
start
he
would
have
been
quickly
at
her
side
she
fled
swiftly
along
the
streets
to
escape
from
him
and
he
pursued
her
hoping
that
she
would
soon
weary
and
would
turn
to
speak
to
him
but
she
kept
on
until
daniel
found
himself
at
the
entrance
of
one
of
the
old
bridges
of
the
city
which
span
the
wide
waters
of
the
river
side
by
side
with
it
a
new
bridge
was
being
constructed
with
massive
beams
of
timber
and
huge
blocks
of
stone
and
vast
girders
of
iron
lying
like
some
giant
skeleton
enveloped
in
the
fog
yet
showing
dimly
through
it
by
the
glare
of
red
lights
and
blazing
torches
which
were
kindled
here
and
there
and
cast
flickering
gleams
upon
the
black
waters
beneath
into
which
daniel
looked
down
with
a
shiver
as
he
paused
for
a
moment
in
his
pursuit
but
he
had
lost
sight
of
the
woman
when
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
again
unless
the
strange
dark
figure
on
one
of
the
great
beams
stretching
over
the
river
was
the
form
of
mother
he
pressed
towards
it
quitting
the
safety
of
the
old
bridge
but
as
a
wild
and
very
mournful
cry
smote
upon
his
ear
he
missed
his
footing
and
fell
heavily
upon
a
pile
of
masonry
at
some
distance
below
him
it
could
only
have
been
a
minute
that
he
was
unconscious
for
the
clock
of
had
chimed
the
first
stroke
of
midnight
as
he
lost
footing
and
the
boom
of
the
last
stroke
was
still
ringing
through
the
air
when
he
tried
to
raise
himself
and
look
again
for
the
dark
figure
which
he
had
seen
hanging
over
the
river
but
he
could
not
move
and
he
lay
quietly
without
making
a
second
effort
and
thinking
clearly
over
what
had
happened
there
was
little
doubt
that
the
wretched
woman
whom
he
had
sought
to
save
had
hurried
away
from
all
salvation
whether
of
god
or
man
and
yet
how
was
it
that
instead
of
the
shock
of
horror
a
perfect
peace
possessed
his
soul
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
hear
a
voice
speaking
through
the
dull
and
monotonous
splashing
of
the
cold
water
against
the
arches
below
him
and
it
said
to
him
thou
hast
been
faithful
unto
death
i
will
give
thee
a
crown
of
was
he
going
to
die
he
asked
himself
as
a
pang
of
extreme
agony
ran
through
all
his
frame
and
extorted
a
moan
from
his
lips
he
was
ready
and
willing
if
it
was
the
will
of
god
but
he
would
like
to
see
his
little
jessica
again
and
tell
her
gently
with
his
own
lips
that
her
mother
was
dead
and
gone
he
could
say
nothing
gentler
to
her
own
place
which
god
knew
of
the
midnight
hour
was
quieter
than
usual
in
the
busy
city
for
it
was
sunday
and
the
night
was
damp
so
daniel
lay
for
some
time
before
he
heard
the
tread
of
a
upon
the
bridge
above
him
he
could
hear
many
sounds
at
a
little
distance
but
he
could
not
raise
his
voice
loudly
enough
to
be
audible
through
the
splash
of
the
waters
but
as
soon
as
he
heard
footsteps
on
the
bridge
he
cried
with
a
strong
effort
me
or
i
shall
die
before
morning
it
seemed
a
long
time
and
one
of
great
suffering
to
him
before
he
was
raised
up
and
laid
upon
the
smooth
pathway
of
the
bridge
but
he
did
not
cry
out
or
groan
and
as
the
little
crowd
which
gathered
around
him
spoke
in
tones
of
commiseration
and
kindness
he
thanked
them
calmly
and
with
a
cheerfulness
which
deceived
them
they
bore
him
to
the
nearest
hospital
but
as
they
would
have
laid
him
on
a
bed
there
he
stopped
them
with
great
energy
and
earnestness
the
doctor
see
me
first
he
said
tell
me
whether
i
am
likely
to
die
or
the
hand
touched
him
and
there
were
a
few
questions
put
to
him
which
he
answered
calmly
and
then
as
the
doctor
looked
down
upon
him
with
a
grave
face
he
looked
back
with
perfect
composure
a
christian
man
said
daniel
not
afraid
to
die
but
if
you
think
no
chance
for
me
rather
go
home
a
little
girl
at
home
like
to
be
with
me
all
the
time
till
taken
away
from
her
the
key
of
my
house
is
in
my
pocket
let
me
be
taken
they
could
not
refuse
his
request
but
the
doctor
told
him
he
might
live
yet
for
some
days
though
the
injuries
he
had
received
gave
no
hope
of
his
life
to
which
daniel
replied
only
by
a
solemn
smile
it
was
nearly
morning
before
he
reached
his
house
under
the
care
of
a
nurse
and
a
student
from
the
hospital
and
thus
he
entered
for
the
last
time
the
home
where
he
had
spent
the
three
happiest
years
of
his
life
with
jessica
chapter
x
speak
of
his
love
for
several
days
daniel
suffered
great
pain
but
with
such
perfect
peace
and
joy
in
his
heart
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
scarcely
realize
or
feel
his
bodily
anguish
jessica
was
with
him
constantly
and
when
he
was
free
from
pain
she
read
aloud
to
him
or
talked
with
him
of
the
heaven
to
which
he
was
going
and
which
seemed
to
be
open
to
his
gaze
already
as
one
catches
a
glimpse
from
afar
off
of
some
beautiful
country
basking
in
the
glory
of
a
full
noontide
sunshine
the
chapel
people
came
to
see
him
some
of
them
in
the
carriages
which
of
old
set
him
pondering
on
their
riches
and
they
left
him
marveling
that
they
had
known
so
little
of
the
religiousness
of
the
man
who
had
ushered
them
to
their
pews
sunday
after
sunday
but
as
yet
the
minister
had
not
visited
him
though
he
had
sent
him
word
that
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
he
would
come
to
see
him
the
last
day
had
arrived
both
daniel
and
jessica
knew
that
it
was
the
last
day
and
she
had
not
stirred
from
his
side
since
morning
and
still
the
minister
had
not
come
had
not
been
able
to
come
to
the
of
his
old
friend
for
they
were
old
friends
having
met
many
times
a
week
for
a
dozen
years
in
the
same
chapel
and
since
jessica
had
drawn
them
closer
together
the
learned
and
eloquent
preacher
had
cared
for
illiterate
soul
and
the
had
learned
to
pick
up
some
crumbs
of
nourishment
from
the
great
feast
which
the
minister
prepared
week
after
week
for
his
intellectual
congregation
he
had
not
been
but
daniel
was
undisturbed
and
so
patient
and
peaceful
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
when
he
met
wistful
eyes
he
waited
for
the
last
hour
and
the
last
moment
to
come
yet
before
it
was
too
late
and
before
his
eye
grew
dim
and
his
tongue
numbed
with
the
chillness
of
death
the
minister
arrived
pale
in
face
and
bowed
down
with
weakness
and
with
a
trembling
voice
which
faltered
often
as
he
spoke
they
clasped
one
hands
and
looked
into
one
face
with
a
strange
recognition
as
if
both
had
seen
further
into
the
other
world
than
they
had
ever
done
before
and
then
the
minister
sank
feebly
into
the
chair
beside
pillow
will
rest
here
and
stay
with
you
for
an
hour
he
said
is
the
last
hour
answered
daniel
it
so
replied
the
minister
too
have
looked
death
in
the
they
were
silent
for
a
while
while
the
minister
rallied
his
strength
and
then
he
bent
his
head
his
head
only
for
he
was
too
feeble
yet
to
kneel
beside
the
dying
man
and
he
poured
forth
a
prayer
to
god
in
his
inmost
heart
but
with
hesitating
lips
which
no
longer
uttered
with
ready
speech
the
thoughts
which
thronged
to
his
brain
the
amen
with
which
he
ended
was
almost
a
groan
power
is
taken
from
me
he
said
almighty
has
stricken
me
in
the
pride
of
my
heart
i
shall
never
more
speak
as
i
used
to
do
of
his
glory
and
majesty
and
the
greatness
of
his
can
speak
of
his
love
murmured
daniel
he
answered
despondently
only
as
a
child
speaks
i
shall
never
stir
the
hearts
of
the
congregation
again
my
speech
will
be
tell
him
what
you
and
i
have
been
talking
about
said
daniel
jessica
lifted
up
her
face
from
the
pillow
and
turned
it
towards
the
minister
a
smile
struggling
through
her
tears
and
though
her
voice
was
unsteady
to
begin
it
grew
calm
and
clear
before
she
had
spoken
many
words
were
talking
how
never
be
the
any
more
and
go
up
into
the
pulpit
to
carry
the
books
before
you
and
then
we
thought
it
was
true
maybe
what
the
doctor
says
that
never
be
well
enough
again
to
preach
in
such
a
big
chapel
and
so
we
went
on
talking
about
the
time
when
we
shall
all
be
in
heaven
we
said
that
perhaps
god
would
give
you
more
beautiful
thoughts
there
and
grander
words
and
still
be
our
minister
and
the
angels
all
come
thronging
up
in
crowds
all
about
you
and
us
to
hearken
to
what
thought
about
jesus
christ
and
about
god
and
be
a
great
congregation
again
only
whenever
you
were
silent
for
a
minute
we
could
look
up
and
see
the
saviour
himself
listening
to
us
then
the
minister
bowed
his
pale
face
upon
his
hands
but
he
did
not
answer
a
word
is
one
thing
still
i
want
to
say
said
daniel
made
my
will
and
left
all
i
had
to
jessica
but
i
know
where
find
a
home
if
look
out
for
her
shall
come
home
to
me
interrupted
the
minister
laying
his
hand
upon
hers
and
and
clasping
them
both
warmly
a
christian
man
whispered
daniel
know
that
i
love
god
and
that
he
has
made
me
something
like
himself
a
verse
about
it
in
the
said
the
minister
are
we
the
sons
of
god
and
it
doth
not
yet
appear
what
we
shall
be
but
we
know
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
shall
be
like
him
for
we
shall
see
him
as
he
there
was
no
stammering
of
the
speech
as
he
pronounced
these
words
and
his
face
grew
bright
as
did
the
face
of
the
dying
man
mind
wandered
a
little
and
he
groped
about
as
in
the
dark
for
the
bible
which
lay
upon
the
bed
and
he
murmured
time
to
take
up
the
books
for
the
congregation
is
waiting
and
the
minister
is
ready
i
will
take
them
up
to
he
spoke
no
more
but
the
bible
after
a
while
fell
from
his
hand
and
jessica
and
the
minister
looking
upon
his
face
saw
that
in
heaven
he
was
beholding
the
face
of
the
father
it
proved
true
that
the
minister
could
never
again
preach
a
sermon
such
as
in
former
times
when
the
people
listened
with
strained
attention
and
he
was
to
them
as
a
very
lovely
song
of
one
that
hath
a
pleasant
voice
and
playeth
well
on
an
instrument
but
they
heard
his
words
and
did
them
not
yet
he
was
a
man
of
calmer
happiness
than
before
and
in
his
quiet
country
home
where
sometimes
of
a
sunday
he
mounted
the
of
a
little
chapel
and
taught
a
simple
congregation
simple
truths
he
drew
nearer
day
by
day
in
spirit
to
the
great
congregation
who
were
waiting
for
him
and
before
whom
his
lips
should
never
more
be
silenced
