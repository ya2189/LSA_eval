chapter
i
a
new
venture
in
sandy
beach
it
is
to
be
a
barn
that
one
thing
certain
who
ever
saw
a
barn
with
skylights
on
it
peggy
prescott
in
a
pretty
fluffy
morning
dress
of
pale
green
which
set
off
her
blonde
beauty
to
perfection
laid
down
her
racket
and
leaving
the
joined
her
brother
roy
at
the
picket
fence
the
lad
bronzed
and
toughened
by
his
trip
to
the
nevada
desert
was
leaning
upon
the
paling
gazing
down
the
dusty
road
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
was
the
object
of
his
contemplation
a
big
new
structure
painted
a
staring
red
it
had
no
windows
but
in
front
were
great
sliding
doors
on
its
flat
roof
the
forms
of
a
dozen
or
more
glazed
skylights
upreared
themselves
jauntily
no
it
a
of
some
sort
but
what
old
man
harding
is
interested
in
it
that
one
thing
sure
i
heard
too
that
while
we
were
away
cases
of
machinery
had
arrived
and
been
delivered
there
and
that
active
work
of
some
sort
had
been
going
forward
ever
since
rejoined
roy
who
was
clad
in
white
tennis
flannels
with
white
shoes
and
an
outing
shirt
set
off
by
a
necktie
see
roy
cried
peggy
suddenly
they
putting
up
some
sort
of
sign
on
it
or
else
i
very
much
mistaken
so
they
are
i
see
men
on
some
ladders
and
now
look
peg
they
are
carrying
up
a
big
board
with
something
painted
on
it
perhaps
at
last
the
mystery
will
be
solved
as
they
say
in
the
dime
novels
can
you
read
the
printing
on
that
sign
inquired
peggy
not
a
word
i
can
see
the
letters
to
know
that
they
are
printed
characters
but
that
all
tell
you
what
peg
just
run
and
get
those
glasses
we
used
on
the
desert
there
a
good
fellow
and
we
soon
find
out
is
that
just
like
a
brother
always
sending
his
sister
on
his
errands
why
you
know
you
are
dying
with
curiosity
yourself
to
know
what
on
that
signboard
parried
roy
and
i
suppose
you
not
pouted
peggy
in
mock
indignation
however
i
get
the
field
glasses
to
oblige
you
just
once
as
if
you
wo
try
to
secure
the
first
peek
through
them
laughed
roy
as
sunny
peggy
tripped
off
across
the
lawn
to
a
big
shed
in
the
rear
of
the
prescott
home
where
the
aeroplanes
and
their
appurtenances
were
kept
she
soon
was
back
with
the
field
glasses
and
as
roy
had
prophesied
raised
them
to
her
eyes
first
having
adjusted
the
focus
she
scrutinized
the
sign
carefully
by
this
time
the
big
board
had
been
raised
horizontally
above
the
doors
and
was
being
fixed
in
position
suddenly
peggy
gave
a
little
squeal
of
astonishment
and
lowered
the
magnifiers
well
what
is
it
chaffed
roy
an
anarchist
bomb
factory
or
an
establishment
for
raising
goats
or
something
that
will
butt
in
just
as
much
on
our
peace
and
quiet
or
roy
prescott
enunciated
peggy
severely
shaking
one
finger
under
roy
freckled
nose
this
is
not
a
subject
for
jesting
never
more
serious
in
my
life
sis
if
you
could
have
seen
your
own
face
as
you
peeked
through
those
glasses
peggy
stuffed
the
binoculars
into
her
brother
brown
hands
here
look
for
yourself
she
ordered
her
voice
was
so
imperious
that
roy
obeyed
immediately
an
instant
later
his
sister
expression
of
dumfounded
amazement
was
mirrored
on
his
own
straightforward
countenance
well
as
bud
used
to
say
out
west
that
ai
the
beatingest
he
gasped
what
did
you
read
demanded
peggy
breathlessly
repeat
it
so
that
i
may
be
sure
my
eyes
did
play
me
a
trick
not
likely
sis
the
letters
are
big
enough
they
show
up
on
that
red
painted
barn
of
a
place
like
a
big
freckle
on
a
pretty
girl
chin
then
he
repeated
slowly
mimicking
a
boy
reciting
a
lesson
the
mortlake
aeroplane
company
well
would
that
jar
you
roy
reproved
peggy
there
no
other
way
to
express
it
sis
protested
the
boy
why
the
concern
that
been
advertising
so
much
recently
just
to
think
it
was
right
at
our
door
and
we
never
knew
it
and
that
hateful
old
harding
is
interested
in
it
too
oh
the
exclamation
and
its
intonation
expressed
peggy
dislike
of
the
gentleman
mentioned
it
a
scheme
oh
his
part
to
make
trouble
for
us
i
bet
on
it
burst
out
roy
but
this
time
i
guess
it
no
phantom
airship
but
the
real
thing
what
time
is
that
naval
lieutenant
coming
to
look
over
the
prescott
aeroplane
peggy
some
time
he
mentioned
no
particular
hour
do
you
think
it
possible
that
he
is
also
going
to
take
in
that
outfit
down
the
road
it
would
surprise
me
maybe
that
why
they
are
just
putting
up
the
sign
they
evidently
have
refrained
from
doing
so
till
now
in
order
to
keep
the
nature
of
their
business
secret
if
we
had
come
back
from
nevada
sooner
than
we
expected
we
might
not
have
known
anything
about
it
till
the
navy
had
investigated
and
approved
far
down
the
road
beyond
the
big
red
building
came
a
whirl
of
dust
from
it
presently
emerged
a
big
maroon
car
peggy
scrutinized
it
through
the
glasses
harding
is
in
that
auto
she
said
rather
quietly
for
peggy
as
the
car
came
to
a
stop
in
front
of
the
mortlake
aeroplane
manufacturing
company
plant
shortly
before
peggy
and
roy
prescott
their
aunt
miss
sallie
prescott
with
whom
they
made
their
home
and
their
chums
jess
and
jimsy
bancroft
had
returned
from
the
nevada
alkali
wastes
the
red
building
which
engaged
their
attention
that
morning
had
caused
a
good
deal
of
speculation
in
the
humdrum
long
island
village
of
sandy
beach
in
the
first
place
coincident
with
the
completion
of
the
building
a
new
element
had
been
introduced
into
the
little
community
by
the
arrival
of
several
men
who
boarded
at
the
local
hotel
and
were
understood
to
be
employees
at
the
new
building
but
what
the
nature
of
their
employment
was
to
be
even
the
keenest
of
the
village
cross
examiners
had
failed
to
elicit
before
long
within
the
freshly
painted
wooden
walls
still
sticky
with
pigment
there
could
be
heard
all
day
and
sometimes
far
into
the
night
the
buzz
and
whir
of
machinery
and
other
more
mystic
sounds
the
village
was
on
of
curiosity
but
there
being
no
side
windows
to
peer
through
and
a
watchman
of
ferocious
aspect
stationed
at
the
door
their
inquisitiveness
was
perforce
unsatisfied
not
even
a
sign
appeared
on
the
building
to
indicate
the
nature
of
the
industry
carried
on
within
and
its
employees
continued
to
observe
the
stoniest
of
silences
they
herded
together
ignoring
all
attempts
to
draw
them
into
conversation
what
peggy
and
roy
had
observed
that
day
had
been
the
first
outward
sign
of
the
inward
business
from
the
throbbing
automobile
which
the
boy
and
girl
had
observed
draw
up
in
front
of
the
mortlake
plant
a
man
of
advanced
age
alighted
whose
yellow
skin
was
stretched
tightly
like
a
drumhead
over
his
bony
face
from
the
new
building
at
the
same
time
there
emerged
a
short
stout
personage
garbed
in
overalls
but
the
fine
quality
of
his
linen
and
a
diamond
pin
which
nestled
in
the
silken
folds
of
his
capacious
necktie
showed
as
clearly
as
did
his
manner
that
the
newcomer
was
by
no
means
an
ordinary
workman
his
face
was
pouchy
and
heavy
although
the
whole
appearance
of
the
man
was
by
no
means
his
cheeks
and
chin
were
clean
shaven
the
beard
showing
bluely
under
the
coarse
skin
for
the
rest
his
hair
was
black
and
thick
slightly
streaked
with
gray
and
heavy
eyebrows
as
dark
in
hue
as
his
hair
overhung
a
pair
of
shrewd
gray
eyes
like
small
the
man
was
eugene
mortlake
the
brains
of
the
mortlake
company
the
individual
who
had
just
descended
from
the
automobile
throwing
a
word
to
the
chauffeur
over
his
shoulder
was
a
person
we
have
met
before
harding
the
banker
and
local
magnate
of
sandy
beach
whose
money
it
was
that
had
financed
the
new
aeroplane
concern
chapter
ii
harding
declares
himself
readers
of
the
first
volume
of
this
series
the
girl
aviators
and
the
phantom
airship
will
recall
harding
they
will
also
be
likely
to
recollect
his
son
fanning
who
made
so
much
trouble
for
peggy
prescott
and
her
brother
culminating
in
a
daring
attempt
to
bluff
them
out
of
entering
a
competition
for
a
big
aerial
prize
by
constructing
a
phantom
aeroplane
fanning
part
in
the
mystery
of
the
stolen
jewels
of
bancroft
the
mother
of
jess
and
jimsy
will
likewise
be
probably
held
in
memory
by
those
who
perused
that
volume
the
elder
harding
part
in
the
attempt
to
coerce
the
young
prescotts
into
parting
with
their
aerial
secrets
consisted
in
trying
to
foreclose
a
mortgage
he
held
on
the
prescott
home
with
the
alternative
of
roy
turning
over
to
him
the
blue
prints
and
descriptions
of
his
devices
left
the
lad
by
his
dead
father
how
the
elder
harding
was
routed
and
how
the
girl
aviator
peggy
prescott
came
into
her
own
was
all
told
in
this
volume
since
that
time
harding
revengeful
nature
had
brooded
over
what
he
chose
to
fancy
were
his
wrongs
what
the
fruit
of
his
moody
and
mean
meditations
was
to
be
the
mortlake
plant
which
he
had
financed
was
in
part
the
answer
in
the
volume
referred
to
it
was
also
related
how
peter
bell
an
old
hermit
had
been
discovered
by
means
of
the
prescott
aeroplane
and
restored
to
his
brother
a
wealthy
mining
magnate
in
the
second
volume
of
the
girl
aviators
we
saw
what
came
of
the
meeting
between
james
bell
the
westerner
and
the
young
flying
folk
by
the
agency
of
the
aeroplane
a
mine
otherwise
inaccessible
had
been
opened
up
by
bell
in
a
remote
part
of
the
desert
hills
of
nevada
the
aeroplane
and
peggy
prescott
played
an
important
part
in
their
adventures
and
perils
notably
so
when
in
a
dash
with
an
express
train
the
aeroplane
won
out
in
a
race
to
file
the
location
papers
of
the
mine
at
monument
rocks
the
rescue
of
a
desert
wanderer
from
a
terrible
death
on
the
alkali
and
the
routing
of
a
gang
of
rascally
outlaws
were
also
set
forth
in
full
in
that
book
which
was
called
the
girl
aviators
on
golden
wings
the
present
story
commences
soon
after
the
return
of
the
party
from
the
far
west
when
they
were
much
surprised
as
has
been
said
to
observe
the
rise
of
the
mortlake
factory
but
of
what
the
new
plant
was
to
mean
to
them
and
how
intimately
they
were
to
be
brought
in
contact
with
it
none
of
them
guessed
well
mortlake
observed
harding
in
his
harsh
squeaky
voice
not
unlike
the
complaint
of
a
long
unused
door
well
mortlake
we
are
getting
ahead
i
see
the
two
men
had
by
this
time
passed
within
the
big
sliding
doors
of
the
shed
and
now
stood
in
a
maze
of
machinery
and
strange
looking
bits
of
apparatus
from
skylights
in
the
roof
there
were
no
side
windows
to
gratify
the
inquisitive
the
sunlight
streamed
down
on
three
or
four
partially
completed
aircraft
with
their
yellow
wings
of
vulcanized
cloth
and
their
slender
bodies
like
long
tails
they
resembled
so
many
or
devil
darning
needles
assembled
in
conclave
upon
the
level
floor
at
the
farther
end
of
the
shed
was
a
small
blast
furnace
shooting
upward
a
livid
blue
spout
of
flame
which
roared
savagely
actively
engaged
at
their
various
tasks
at
lathes
and
were
a
dozen
or
more
overalled
mechanics
the
most
skillful
in
their
line
that
could
be
gathered
here
and
there
were
the
motors
the
driving
power
of
the
dragon
flies
the
engines
glistened
with
new
paint
and
bright
brass
and
copper
parts
behind
them
were
ranged
big
propellers
of
laminated
or
joined
wood
in
stripes
of
brown
and
yellow
timber
altogether
the
mortlake
plant
was
as
complete
a
one
for
the
manufacture
of
aerial
machines
as
could
have
been
found
in
the
country
yes
we
are
getting
along
harding
returned
mortlake
and
time
too
by
the
way
lieut
bradbury
is
due
here
at
noon
i
want
to
have
everything
as
far
advanced
as
possible
in
time
for
his
visit
you
mind
accompanying
me
then
while
i
oversee
the
workmen
followed
by
harding
he
made
an
active
nervous
tour
of
the
dropping
a
reproof
here
and
a
nod
of
commendation
or
advice
there
when
he
saw
a
chance
harding
spoke
so
the
government
really
means
to
give
us
an
opportunity
to
show
the
worth
of
our
machines
he
grated
out
rubbing
his
hands
as
if
washing
them
in
some
sort
of
invisible
soap
yes
so
it
seems
at
any
rate
they
notified
me
that
this
officer
would
be
here
to
inspect
the
place
it
means
a
great
deal
for
us
if
the
government
consents
to
adopt
our
form
of
machine
for
the
naval
experiments
to
us
to
you
you
mean
echoed
harding
with
an
unpleasant
laugh
i
put
enough
capital
into
this
thing
now
mortlake
i
not
the
man
to
throw
good
money
after
bad
if
we
are
defeated
by
any
other
make
of
machine
at
the
tests
i
mean
to
sell
the
whole
thing
and
at
least
realize
what
i
put
into
it
mortlake
turned
a
little
pale
under
his
swarthy
skin
he
rubbed
his
blue
chin
nervously
why
you
would
chuck
us
over
now
harding
he
said
deprecatingly
it
was
at
your
solicitation
that
the
plant
was
put
up
here
and
i
had
relied
on
you
for
unlimited
support
why
did
you
go
into
the
manufacture
of
aerial
machines
if
you
did
mean
to
stick
it
out
i
had
two
reasons
was
the
rejoinder
in
tones
as
cold
as
a
frigid
blast
of
wind
one
was
that
i
thought
it
was
certain
we
should
capture
the
government
contract
and
the
other
was
well
i
had
a
little
grudge
i
wished
to
satisfy
but
we
will
capture
the
government
business
i
am
not
afraid
there
is
no
machine
to
touch
the
mortlake
that
i
know
of
yes
there
is
interrupted
harding
a
machine
that
may
be
able
to
discount
it
in
every
way
nonsense
where
is
such
an
aeroplane
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
here
to
be
accurate
young
prescott
you
know
whom
i
mean
the
other
nodded
abstractedly
well
that
youth
has
a
monoplane
that
has
already
caused
me
a
lot
of
trouble
the
old
man
yellow
skin
darkened
with
anger
and
his
blue
pinpoints
of
eyes
grew
flinty
it
was
partly
out
of
revenge
that
i
decided
to
start
up
an
opposition
business
to
his
he
was
in
the
west
till
a
few
days
ago
and
i
never
dreamed
that
he
would
return
till
i
had
secured
the
government
contract
but
i
am
now
informed
oh
i
have
ears
everywhere
in
sandy
beach
that
this
boy
and
his
sister
who
is
in
a
kind
of
partnership
with
him
have
had
the
audacity
to
offer
their
machine
for
the
government
tests
also
audacity
muttered
mortlake
under
his
breath
but
harding
keen
ears
caught
the
remark
it
is
audacity
agreed
the
old
financier
and
audacity
that
we
must
find
some
way
to
checkmate
i
never
had
a
business
rival
yet
that
i
have
broken
into
submission
or
crushed
and
a
boy
and
a
girl
are
not
going
to
outwit
me
now
they
did
it
once
i
admit
but
this
time
i
shall
arrange
things
differently
you
mean
that
i
intend
to
cinch
that
government
business
but
what
if
as
you
fear
the
prescotts
have
a
superior
aeroplane
my
dear
mortlake
the
eyes
almost
closed
and
the
thin
bloodless
lips
drew
together
in
a
tight
line
if
they
have
a
superior
machine
we
must
arrange
so
that
nobody
but
ourselves
is
ever
aware
of
the
fact
with
a
throaty
gurgle
that
might
or
might
not
have
been
meant
for
a
chuckle
the
old
man
glided
through
the
doors
which
by
this
time
he
had
reached
and
sliding
rather
than
stepping
into
his
machine
gave
the
chauffeur
some
orders
mortlake
a
peculiar
expression
on
his
face
looked
after
the
car
as
it
chugged
off
and
then
turned
and
the
shop
his
head
was
bent
and
he
seemed
to
be
lost
in
deep
thought
chapter
iii
a
naval
visitor
roy
had
departed
on
an
errand
for
town
peggy
indolently
enjoying
the
perfect
drowsiness
of
noonday
was
reclining
in
a
gayly
colored
hammock
suspended
between
two
regal
maple
trees
on
the
lawn
in
her
hand
was
a
book
on
a
taboret
by
her
side
was
a
big
pink
box
full
of
chocolates
the
girl
was
not
reading
however
her
blue
eyes
were
staring
straight
up
through
the
delicate
green
tracery
of
the
big
maples
at
the
sky
above
she
watched
with
lazy
fascination
tiny
white
clouds
drifting
slowly
across
the
blue
like
tiny
argosies
of
the
heavens
her
mind
was
far
away
from
sandy
beach
and
its
peaceful
surroundings
the
young
girl
thoughts
were
of
the
desert
the
bleak
arid
wastes
of
alkali
which
lay
so
far
behind
them
now
almost
like
events
that
had
happened
in
another
life
suddenly
she
was
aroused
from
her
reverie
by
a
voice
a
remarkably
pleasant
voice
i
beg
your
pardon
is
this
the
prescott
house
good
gracious
a
man
exclaimed
peggy
to
herself
getting
out
of
the
hammock
as
gracefully
as
she
could
and
with
a
rather
flushed
face
at
the
gate
stood
a
rickety
station
hack
which
had
approached
on
the
soft
dusty
road
almost
noiselessly
just
stepping
out
of
it
was
a
sunburned
young
man
very
upright
in
carriage
and
dressed
in
a
suit
with
a
jaunty
straw
hat
he
carried
a
bamboo
cane
which
he
switched
somewhat
nervously
as
the
pretty
girl
advanced
toward
him
across
the
lawn
i
am
lieut
bradbury
of
the
navy
said
the
newcomer
and
peggy
noted
that
his
whole
appearance
was
as
pleasant
and
wholesome
as
his
voice
i
came
er
in
response
to
your
letter
to
the
department
in
regard
to
the
forthcoming
trials
of
aeroplanes
for
the
service
oh
yes
exclaimed
peggy
smothering
an
inclination
to
giggle
we
i
that
is
i
presume
that
i
have
called
at
the
right
place
said
the
young
officer
with
a
smile
they
told
me
oh
come
in
wo
you
suddenly
requested
the
embarrassed
peggy
the
sun
is
fearfully
hot
wo
you
have
a
straw
hat
i
mean
a
seat
thank
you
replied
lieut
bradbury
gravely
sitting
in
a
garden
bench
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
big
maples
his
eyes
fell
on
the
book
peggy
had
been
reading
it
was
a
treatise
on
aeronautics
it
is
possible
that
you
are
r
prescott
he
asked
glancing
up
quickly
oh
no
i
am
only
a
humble
helper
prescott
is
in
town
he
he
will
be
back
shortly
indeed
i
had
hoped
to
see
him
personally
i
was
anxious
to
inspect
the
prescott
type
of
monoplane
before
visiting
another
aeroplane
plant
in
this
neighborhood
the
the
the
officer
drew
out
a
small
morocco
covered
notebook
and
referred
to
it
the
mortlake
aeroplane
company
he
concluded
oh
yes
they
are
just
down
the
road
within
a
stone
throw
of
here
you
can
see
the
place
from
here
that
big
structure
volunteered
peggy
heartily
wishing
that
the
mortlake
plant
had
been
a
hundred
miles
away
indeed
that
very
convenient
i
shall
be
able
to
make
an
early
train
back
to
new
york
do
you
suppose
that
prescott
will
be
long
i
do
really
know
he
should
be
unless
he
is
delayed
but
in
the
meantime
i
can
show
you
the
aeroplane
if
you
wish
ah
the
officer
glanced
at
this
girl
curiously
but
you
know
what
i
particularly
desired
was
a
practical
demonstration
a
flight
yes
if
it
were
possible
i
think
it
can
be
arranged
you
have
an
aviator
attached
to
your
place
then
peggy
laughed
musically
she
had
quite
recovered
from
her
embarrassment
now
no
i
guess
it
an
aviatress
if
there
is
such
a
word
you
see
i
you
oh
yes
i
have
flown
quite
a
good
deal
recently
i
think
it
is
the
most
delightful
sport
there
is
a
sudden
light
seemed
to
break
over
the
young
officer
are
you
miss
margaret
prescott
the
girl
aviator
i
have
read
so
much
about
in
the
technical
publications
i
believe
i
am
smiled
peggy
but
here
comes
my
aunt
miss
sallie
prescott
as
she
spoke
miss
prescott
in
a
soft
gown
of
cool
white
material
emerged
from
the
house
peggy
went
through
the
ceremony
of
introduction
after
which
they
all
directed
their
steps
to
the
large
shed
in
which
the
prescott
machines
were
kept
in
the
meantime
old
sam
hickey
the
gardener
and
his
stalwart
son
jerusah
had
been
summoned
to
aid
in
dragging
out
one
of
the
aeroplanes
we
only
have
two
on
hand
explained
peggy
my
brother
has
forwarded
the
others
that
we
built
to
james
bell
the
mining
man
they
are
being
used
in
aerial
gold
transportation
across
the
nevada
desert
indeed
that
is
most
interesting
sam
hickey
flung
open
the
big
doors
and
revealed
the
interior
of
the
shed
with
the
two
monoplanes
standing
within
a
strong
smell
of
gasoline
and
filled
the
air
the
officer
glanced
at
dainty
figure
in
astonishment
it
seemed
hard
to
associate
this
refined
exquisite
young
girl
with
the
rough
actualities
of
machinery
and
aeroplanes
illustration
when
she
emerged
a
very
peggy
had
taken
the
place
of
the
lounger
in
the
hammock
but
peggy
with
a
word
of
excuse
dived
suddenly
into
a
small
room
while
she
was
gone
miss
prescott
entertained
the
young
officer
with
many
tales
of
her
harrowing
experiences
on
the
nevada
desert
to
all
of
which
he
listened
with
keen
attention
at
least
he
did
so
to
all
outward
appearance
but
his
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
door
through
which
peggy
had
vanished
when
she
emerged
a
very
peggy
had
taken
the
place
of
the
lounger
in
the
hammock
a
linen
duster
fitting
tightly
covered
her
from
top
to
toe
a
motoring
bonnet
of
maroon
silk
imprisoned
her
hair
and
upon
its
rim
above
her
forehead
was
perched
a
pair
of
goggles
gauntlets
encased
her
hands
looks
rather
too
warm
to
be
comfortable
does
it
she
laughed
but
we
shall
find
it
cool
enough
up
above
perhaps
the
lieutenant
ventured
miss
prescott
oh
yes
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
have
thought
of
it
exclaimed
peggy
bradbury
you
will
find
aviation
togs
inside
there
by
jove
she
knows
enough
not
to
call
a
naval
officer
thought
the
young
officer
as
with
a
bow
and
a
word
of
thanks
he
vanished
to
equip
himself
for
his
aerial
excursion
by
the
time
he
was
invested
in
a
similar
long
duster
with
weighted
seams
and
had
donned
a
cap
and
goggles
the
larger
of
the
two
aeroplanes
named
the
was
ready
for
its
passengers
old
sam
and
his
son
who
had
dragged
it
out
it
moved
easily
on
its
landing
wheels
stood
by
their
awe
of
the
big
craft
showing
plainly
on
their
faces
a
section
of
the
fence
had
been
made
removable
so
as
to
give
the
prescott
aeroplanes
a
free
run
from
their
stable
to
the
smooth
slope
of
the
meadows
beyond
this
was
now
removed
and
peggy
followed
by
the
young
officer
took
her
place
in
the
chassis
peggy
made
a
pretty
figure
at
the
steering
wheel
the
first
improvement
i
should
like
to
call
your
attention
to
she
began
in
the
most
tones
she
could
muster
up
is
the
it
works
by
pneumatic
power
and
does
away
with
the
method
of
starting
an
aeroplane
by
twisting
the
propeller
the
girl
opened
a
valve
connected
with
a
galvanized
tank
with
a
pressure
gauge
on
top
and
pulled
back
a
lever
instantly
a
hissing
sound
filled
the
air
then
with
a
dexterous
movement
peggy
threw
in
the
spark
and
turned
on
the
gasoline
which
the
spark
would
ignite
thereby
causing
an
explosion
in
the
cylinders
but
first
the
compressed
air
had
started
the
motor
turning
over
at
the
right
moment
peggy
switched
on
the
power
and
cut
off
the
air
instantly
there
was
a
roar
from
the
exhausts
and
blue
flames
and
smoke
spouted
from
the
motor
the
aeroplane
shook
violently
it
would
have
made
an
inexperienced
person
teeth
chatter
but
both
the
officer
and
peggy
were
sufficiently
familiar
with
aeroplanes
for
it
not
to
bother
them
in
the
least
magnificent
cried
the
young
officer
enthusiastically
as
he
saw
the
ease
with
which
the
compressed
air
attachment
set
the
motor
to
working
it
will
do
away
with
assistants
to
start
the
machine
he
declared
the
next
instant
the
importance
of
that
in
warfare
can
hardly
be
overestimated
peggy
was
too
busy
to
reply
so
far
all
had
gone
splendidly
if
only
she
could
carry
out
the
whole
test
as
well
ready
she
asked
flinging
back
the
word
over
her
shoulder
to
lieutenant
bradbury
all
ready
came
in
a
hearty
voice
from
behind
her
peggy
with
a
quick
movement
threw
in
the
clutch
that
started
the
propeller
to
whirring
with
a
drone
like
that
of
a
huge
or
prehistoric
the
machine
leaped
forward
as
a
jumps
under
the
raised
barrier
in
a
blur
of
blue
smoke
it
skimmed
through
the
gap
in
the
palings
out
upon
the
smooth
meadowland
it
shot
roaring
and
smoking
terrifically
and
then
all
at
once
the
jolting
motion
of
the
start
ceased
it
seemed
as
if
the
occupants
of
the
chassis
were
riding
luxuriously
over
a
road
paved
with
the
softest
of
eiderdown
the
sensation
was
delightful
exhilarating
peggy
shut
off
the
exhaust
turning
the
explosions
of
the
cylinder
into
a
muffler
in
almost
complete
silence
they
winged
upward
up
up
toward
the
fleecy
clouds
she
had
been
lazily
watching
but
a
short
time
before
from
the
hammock
the
had
never
done
better
you
a
darling
breathed
peggy
confidentially
to
the
motor
that
with
steady
pulse
drove
them
upward
and
onward
chapter
iv
in
a
storm
dwarfed
to
the
merest
midgets
the
figures
about
the
prescott
house
waved
enthusiastically
as
the
monoplane
made
a
graceful
swoop
high
above
the
elms
and
maples
surrounding
it
other
figures
could
be
glimpsed
too
now
running
about
excitedly
outside
the
structure
housing
the
mortlake
aeroplanes
guess
they
think
you
are
stealing
a
march
on
them
drawled
lieut
bradbury
a
wild
reckless
feeling
born
of
the
thrilling
sensation
of
aerial
riding
came
over
peggy
she
would
do
it
she
would
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
thrust
of
her
wrist
she
altered
the
angle
of
the
tail
and
instantly
the
obedient
began
racing
through
space
toward
the
mortlake
plant
the
naval
officer
quick
to
guess
her
plan
laughed
as
happily
as
a
mischievous
boy
what
a
lark
he
exclaimed
it
contrary
to
all
discipline
but
jolly
good
fun
peggy
turned
a
small
valve
the
timer
at
once
the
aeroplane
showed
accelerated
speed
it
fairly
cut
through
the
air
both
the
occupants
were
glad
to
lower
their
goggles
to
protect
their
eyes
from
the
sharp
cutting
sensation
of
the
atmosphere
as
they
rushed
against
it
into
its
teeth
as
it
were
peggy
glanced
at
the
indicator
the
black
pointer
on
the
white
dial
was
creeping
up
fifty
sixty
she
would
show
this
officer
what
the
prescott
monoplane
could
do
great
christmas
the
exclamation
came
from
the
officer
he
had
leaned
forward
and
scanned
the
indicator
eagerly
we
do
better
when
we
have
our
new
type
of
motor
installed
said
peggy
with
a
confident
nod
the
young
fellow
gasped
this
is
the
twentieth
century
with
a
vengeance
he
murmured
sinking
back
in
his
rear
seat
which
was
as
comfortably
upholstered
as
the
luxurious
tonneau
of
a
automobile
like
a
darting
pouncing
swallow
seeking
its
food
in
the
swooped
soared
and
dived
in
long
graceful
gradients
above
the
mortlake
plant
once
peggy
brought
the
aeroplane
so
close
to
the
ground
in
a
long
swinging
sweep
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
could
never
recover
enough
way
to
rise
again
even
the
officer
trained
in
a
strict
school
to
repress
his
emotions
tightened
his
lips
and
then
opened
them
to
emit
a
relieved
gasp
so
close
to
the
gaping
machinists
and
the
mortlake
did
the
triumphant
aeroplane
swoop
that
peggy
to
her
secret
amusement
could
trace
the
astonished
look
on
the
faces
of
the
employees
and
the
chagrined
expression
that
darkened
mortlake
countenance
i
guess
i
given
them
something
to
think
over
she
said
mischievously
flinging
back
a
brilliant
smile
at
the
dazed
young
officer
now
she
exclaimed
the
next
moment
for
a
distance
flight
i
anxious
to
put
the
through
all
her
paces
oh
by
the
way
the
balancer
i
have
shown
you
how
that
works
yet
if
peggy
bright
eyes
had
not
been
veiled
by
goggles
the
officer
might
have
seen
a
mischievous
gleam
flash
into
them
like
a
wind
ripple
over
the
placid
surface
of
a
blue
lake
suddenly
the
aeroplane
slanted
to
one
side
as
if
it
must
turn
over
peggy
had
banked
it
on
a
sharp
aerial
curve
the
young
officer
in
spite
of
himself
in
defiance
of
his
training
gave
a
gasp
i
say
but
the
words
had
hardly
left
his
lips
before
the
aeroplane
was
back
on
a
level
keel
once
more
at
the
same
time
a
rasping
sliding
sound
was
heard
like
to
see
how
that
was
done
asked
peggy
with
a
bewitching
smile
yes
by
jove
i
thought
we
were
over
for
an
instant
but
how
that
we
shall
be
glad
to
show
you
when
the
united
states
government
has
contracted
for
a
number
of
the
prescott
aeroplanes
retorted
peggy
the
young
officer
bit
his
lip
confound
it
he
thought
is
this
chit
of
a
girl
making
fun
of
me
young
officers
have
a
high
idea
of
their
own
dignity
bradbury
colored
a
bit
with
mortification
but
peggy
quickly
dispelled
his
temporary
chagrin
you
see
she
explained
it
would
never
do
for
us
to
reveal
all
our
secrets
would
it
you
agree
with
me
do
you
oh
perfectly
you
are
quite
right
still
i
confess
that
you
have
aroused
all
my
inquisitiveness
peggy
being
busied
just
then
with
a
bit
of
machinery
on
the
bulkhead
separating
the
motor
from
the
body
of
the
chassis
made
no
reply
but
presently
when
she
looked
up
she
gave
a
sharp
exclamation
the
sky
as
if
by
magic
had
grown
suddenly
dark
above
the
pulsating
voice
of
the
motor
could
be
heard
the
rumble
of
thunder
all
at
once
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
leaped
across
the
horizon
one
of
those
sudden
storms
of
summer
had
blown
up
from
the
sea
and
peggy
knew
enough
of
long
island
weather
to
know
that
these
disturbances
were
usually
accompanied
by
terrific
winds
squalls
and
gusts
that
no
aeroplane
yet
built
or
thought
of
could
hope
to
cope
with
we
running
into
dirty
weather
it
seems
remarked
the
officer
i
thought
i
noticed
some
thunderheads
away
off
on
the
horizon
when
we
first
went
up
i
wish
you
mentioned
them
then
said
the
straightforward
peggy
as
it
is
we
have
to
descend
till
this
blows
over
what
wo
even
the
wonderful
equalizer
render
her
safe
no
it
wo
it
will
do
anything
reasonable
but
you
no
idea
of
the
fury
of
the
wind
that
comes
with
these
black
squalls
indeed
i
have
last
summer
i
was
off
montauk
point
in
the
something
went
wrong
with
the
steering
gear
just
as
one
of
these
young
hurricanes
came
bustling
up
i
tell
you
it
was
all
hands
and
the
cook
for
a
while
it
hardly
blows
much
harder
in
a
typhoon
peggy
gazed
below
her
over
the
darkening
landscape
anxiously
there
seemed
to
be
trees
trees
everywhere
and
not
a
bit
of
cleared
ground
all
at
once
as
they
cleared
some
woods
she
spied
a
bit
of
meadowland
the
hay
which
had
covered
it
earlier
in
the
summer
had
been
cropped
it
afforded
an
ideal
but
the
wind
was
puffy
now
and
peggy
did
not
dare
to
attempt
short
descending
spirals
instead
trusting
to
the
balancing
device
doing
its
duty
faithfully
she
swung
down
in
long
circles
just
as
they
touched
the
ground
with
a
gentle
shock
much
minimized
thanks
to
the
with
which
the
was
fitted
the
storm
burst
in
all
its
fury
bolt
after
bolt
of
vivid
lightning
ripped
and
tore
across
the
darkened
sky
which
hung
like
a
pall
behind
the
terrific
electrical
display
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
just
in
time
laughed
the
young
officer
as
he
aided
peggy
in
dragging
the
aeroplane
under
the
shelter
of
an
open
it
was
quite
snug
and
dry
once
they
had
it
under
the
roof
a
short
distance
off
stood
a
of
fairly
comfortable
appearance
smoke
issuing
from
one
of
its
chimneys
showed
that
it
was
occupied
let
go
over
there
and
see
if
we
can
dry
our
things
suggested
peggy
i
wet
through
same
here
was
the
laughing
reply
but
a
sailor
does
mind
that
one
actually
gets
webbed
feet
in
the
navy
like
ducks
you
know
ignoring
this
remarkable
contribution
to
natural
history
peggy
gathered
up
her
skirts
daintily
and
fled
across
the
meadow
to
the
it
was
only
a
few
hundred
feet
but
the
rain
came
down
so
hard
that
both
she
and
her
escort
were
wetter
than
ever
by
the
time
they
arrived
at
the
door
it
was
shut
and
except
for
the
lazy
wisps
of
smoke
issuing
from
the
chimney
there
was
no
sign
of
life
about
the
place
the
lieutenant
knocked
thunderously
no
answer
try
again
said
peggy
maybe
they
are
in
some
other
part
of
the
house
perhaps
they
were
scared
of
the
aeroplane
and
have
all
retired
into
hiding
suggested
bradbury
he
rapped
again
louder
this
time
but
still
no
reply
they
must
all
be
asleep
he
said
applying
himself
once
more
to
a
thunderous
assault
on
the
door
but
to
no
avail
a
silence
hung
about
the
place
broken
only
by
the
roar
and
rattle
of
the
thunder
it
positively
uncanny
shuddered
peggy
it
like
red
riding
hood
and
the
three
little
bears
one
would
think
that
even
a
bear
would
open
the
door
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
said
her
companion
redoubling
his
efforts
to
attract
attention
finally
he
gave
the
door
handle
a
twist
it
yielded
and
the
door
was
speedily
found
to
be
unlocked
the
officer
shoved
it
open
and
disclosed
a
neat
kitchen
in
a
newly
blackened
stove
which
fairly
shone
was
a
blazing
fire
an
old
clock
ticked
sturdily
in
one
corner
the
floor
was
scrubbed
as
white
as
snow
and
on
a
shelf
above
the
shining
stove
was
an
array
of
gleaming
copper
pans
that
gladdened
peggy
housewifely
heart
what
a
dear
of
a
place
she
exclaimed
but
where
are
the
folks
who
own
it
have
the
least
idea
said
the
officer
gayly
but
that
stove
looks
inviting
to
me
let
get
over
to
it
and
get
dried
out
a
bit
then
we
can
commence
to
investigate
but
really
you
know
we
not
the
least
right
in
here
suppose
they
mistake
us
for
burglars
and
shoot
us
not
much
danger
of
that
they
shoot
me
first
anyhow
because
i
the
most
burglarious
looking
of
the
two
queer
though
where
they
all
can
be
it
worse
than
queer
it
weird
good
gracious
exclaimed
peggy
as
a
sudden
thought
struck
her
suppose
there
should
be
trapdoors
trapdoors
her
companion
was
plainly
puzzled
yes
you
know
in
most
books
when
two
folks
run
across
a
deserted
there
always
a
trapdoor
or
a
ghost
or
something
suppose
good
heavens
what
that
from
without
had
come
a
most
peculiar
sound
a
whirring
like
the
noise
one
would
suppose
would
be
occasioned
by
a
gigantic
locust
then
something
a
huge
indefinite
shadow
darkened
the
windows
of
the
kitchen
peggy
gave
a
shrill
squeal
of
alarm
while
lieut
bradbury
gallantly
ran
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
chapter
peggy
a
heroine
it
it
another
aeroplane
cried
the
officer
with
a
shout
of
amazement
what
peggy
sprang
to
her
feet
a
large
red
one
yes
come
here
and
look
they
just
running
it
under
the
same
shed
as
ours
yours
i
mean
the
girl
aviator
sprang
toward
the
door
through
the
rain
she
peered
to
where
across
the
meadow
two
dim
figures
clad
in
oilskins
could
be
seen
shoving
a
big
aeroplane
under
the
same
shelter
that
already
protected
the
well
if
this
is
the
ultimate
she
gasped
i
beg
your
pardon
asked
the
young
man
at
her
side
the
ultimate
that
my
way
of
expressing
what
the
boys
call
limit
why
that
jess
and
jimsy
bancroft
in
their
new
aeroplane
the
one
roy
built
for
them
well
did
you
ever
oh
jess
oh
jimsy
peggy
raised
her
voice
and
shouted
in
response
they
saw
the
figures
turn
and
through
the
driving
downpour
came
an
answering
shout
presently
across
the
dripping
meadows
the
two
figures
began
advancing
all
this
time
the
lightning
was
ripping
in
a
manner
to
make
peggy
shield
her
eyes
occasionally
the
thunder
too
was
terrific
and
the
earth
seemed
to
vibrate
to
its
rolling
detonations
well
peggy
gasped
jess
her
dark
eyes
peering
from
under
her
waterproof
hood
as
she
and
her
brother
arrived
at
the
threshold
of
the
what
on
earth
does
this
mean
yes
give
an
account
of
yourself
at
once
demanded
jimsy
roy
had
us
on
the
phone
asked
if
you
flown
in
our
direction
we
said
no
but
take
a
flight
and
look
for
you
in
our
enthusiasm
we
did
notice
the
storm
coming
up
but
luckily
being
young
persons
of
forethought
we
had
oilskins
in
a
locker
of
the
machine
and
and
here
we
are
finished
jess
shooting
a
killing
glance
from
under
her
hood
at
the
young
man
at
peggy
side
are
you
going
to
ask
us
in
demanded
jimsy
the
next
minute
for
hospitality
i
do
think
you
rate
very
high
we
well
you
see
we
are
here
ourselves
without
knowing
if
we
have
any
right
to
be
rejoined
peggy
but
come
in
and
i
explain
first
of
all
i
want
you
to
meet
bradbury
of
the
united
states
navy
he
came
to
test
the
prescott
aeroplanes
bradbury
this
is
miss
bancroft
and
her
brother
jimsy
put
in
that
irrepressible
youth
glad
to
meet
you
sir
almost
as
much
at
sea
here
as
in
laughing
they
all
entered
the
kitchen
while
peggy
hastily
explained
the
state
of
affairs
there
well
so
long
as
they
do
put
in
an
appearance
before
we
get
dry
sure
i
do
care
said
jimsy
airily
what
a
delightful
old
kitchen
it
might
have
come
out
of
a
picture
book
he
and
the
naval
officer
were
soon
deep
in
conversation
leaving
peggy
and
jess
alone
my
dear
peggy
exclaimed
jess
with
a
smile
that
showed
all
her
white
even
teeth
what
will
you
do
next
do
you
think
it
a
bit
er
er
unconventional
for
one
of
the
foremost
members
of
sandy
beach
younger
set
to
be
flying
about
the
country
with
a
young
naval
officer
nonsense
retorted
peggy
sharply
as
the
only
representative
of
the
prescott
aeroplanes
on
the
ground
i
had
to
do
it
if
it
had
been
for
this
old
storm
i
have
been
home
long
ago
so
should
we
what
a
coincidence
we
should
have
met
here
is
this
this
lieutenant
prompted
peggy
is
this
lieutenant
going
to
stay
long
in
sandy
beach
dear
me
no
he
is
only
on
a
flying
visit
no
pun
intended
he
was
to
have
taken
in
the
establishment
of
the
mortlake
aeroplane
company
this
afternoon
you
know
they
are
in
that
red
place
down
the
road
from
our
place
although
roy
and
i
only
found
it
out
that
was
one
of
the
things
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
peggy
dear
said
jess
sinking
into
an
andrew
jackson
chair
by
the
hearth
dad
said
at
dinner
last
night
that
he
had
heard
in
new
york
that
a
lot
of
their
stock
had
been
floated
on
wall
street
and
that
that
hateful
old
harding
was
back
of
it
they
are
actually
selling
stock
asked
peggy
growing
a
bit
pale
yes
they
have
advertisements
in
a
lot
of
papers
i
believe
dad
said
so
but
why
do
you
look
so
distressed
peggy
because
they
must
be
very
sure
of
the
merits
of
their
machines
if
they
are
going
ahead
so
confidently
rumor
has
it
that
their
make
of
aeroplane
is
the
most
and
complete
yet
constructed
but
nobody
knows
the
details
so
far
they
have
kept
that
part
of
it
close
they
are
making
a
bid
for
the
navy
contracts
at
any
rate
said
peggy
presently
after
a
pause
during
which
both
girls
winked
and
blinked
at
the
lightning
and
stared
at
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
so
you
said
but
you
stole
a
march
on
them
by
kidnapping
your
lieutenant
in
this
way
you
ought
to
give
the
weather
credit
for
that
laughed
peggy
but
seriously
jess
there
is
no
sentiment
in
things
of
this
kind
if
the
mortlake
machine
is
a
better
machine
than
ours
the
mortlake
will
be
the
type
adopted
by
the
government
i
suppose
that
so
agreed
jess
with
a
wry
face
but
i
hate
to
think
of
that
old
harding
creature
getting
any
the
door
flew
open
suddenly
and
a
tall
woman
in
a
raincoat
and
holding
up
an
umbrella
stood
in
the
doorway
well
for
the
land
sake
she
ejaculated
looking
fairly
dumfounded
as
she
comprehended
the
scene
and
the
young
folks
enjoying
the
unrequested
hospitality
of
her
kitchen
but
the
words
had
hardly
left
her
lips
and
she
was
still
standing
there
like
an
image
carved
from
stone
when
a
fearful
light
illumined
the
whole
scene
it
was
followed
almost
instantaneously
by
a
clap
of
thunder
so
deafening
that
the
girls
involuntarily
quailed
before
it
a
fiery
ball
darted
from
the
chimney
and
sped
across
the
room
exploding
in
fragments
with
a
terrific
noise
on
the
opposite
side
just
above
the
heads
of
jimsy
and
lieut
bradbury
stunned
by
the
shock
they
both
collapsed
in
heaps
on
the
floor
while
the
farm
woman
shrieks
filled
the
air
at
the
same
instant
a
pungent
sinister
odor
filled
the
atmosphere
the
house
is
on
fire
shrieked
the
woman
in
a
frenzied
voice
smoke
rolled
down
into
the
room
and
the
acrid
fumes
grew
sharper
the
house
is
on
fire
and
my
baby
is
where
demanded
peggy
in
the
room
above
this
groaned
the
woman
taking
a
few
steps
and
then
fainting
jess
cried
peggy
in
a
tense
voice
take
that
bucket
and
get
water
from
that
pump
in
the
corner
and
then
follow
me
but
the
boys
gasped
jess
they
are
only
stunned
i
saw
jimsy
arm
move
just
now
and
the
lieutenant
is
breathing
with
these
words
she
started
from
the
room
darting
up
a
narrow
stairway
leading
from
one
end
of
the
kitchen
to
the
upper
regions
what
are
you
going
to
do
shouted
jess
her
voice
shaky
with
alarm
save
that
child
if
i
can
flung
back
peggy
plunging
bravely
up
the
stairway
in
the
unfamiliar
house
and
half
blinded
and
choked
by
smoke
and
sulphurous
fumes
peggy
had
a
hard
task
before
her
but
she
pluckily
plunged
forward
feeling
her
way
by
the
walls
and
keeping
her
head
low
where
the
smoke
was
not
so
thick
as
she
reached
what
she
deemed
was
the
top
of
the
staircase
she
thought
she
heard
a
tiny
voice
crying
out
in
alarm
following
the
direction
of
the
sounds
she
staggered
along
a
hallway
and
then
reeled
into
an
open
door
the
smoke
was
not
so
thick
in
the
room
but
its
fumes
were
heavy
enough
in
a
crib
in
one
corner
lay
a
child
of
about
two
years
of
age
its
of
a
face
was
wrinkled
up
in
its
efforts
to
make
its
terrified
little
voice
heard
peggy
darted
upon
it
and
hugged
it
close
to
her
then
with
renewed
courage
she
started
to
make
her
way
back
again
but
more
smoke
than
ever
was
rolling
along
the
passage
and
it
was
a
hard
task
i
must
do
it
i
must
peggy
kept
saying
to
herself
clinging
the
while
to
the
terrified
child
but
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
the
conditions
appalled
her
the
smoke
was
thick
as
a
blanket
there
yet
plunge
through
it
peggy
knew
she
must
still
holding
the
child
tightly
she
bravely
entered
the
dense
smother
stooping
as
low
as
she
dared
but
before
she
had
taken
more
than
two
steps
in
the
obscurity
a
dreadful
feeling
as
if
a
hand
was
at
her
throat
and
choking
her
overcame
the
girl
she
tried
to
call
out
but
she
could
not
her
head
was
reeling
her
eyes
blinded
all
at
once
something
in
her
head
seemed
to
snap
with
a
loud
report
still
clutching
her
little
burden
tightly
peggy
plunged
forward
dizzily
and
knew
no
more

deposit
when
she
came
to
herself
again
it
was
in
a
confusion
of
voices
and
sounds
of
hurrying
footsteps
she
was
lying
on
a
lounge
in
a
stuffy
best
parlor
which
smelled
as
moldy
as
best
parlors
in
are
wont
to
do
bending
over
her
was
the
angular
woman
who
had
entered
just
as
the
bolt
of
lightning
that
had
caused
all
the
trouble
struck
the
house
is
is
the
baby
all
right
asked
peggy
as
she
took
in
her
surroundings
yes
thanks
to
you
my
dear
oh
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
exclaimed
the
woman
a
thrill
of
real
gratitude
in
her
voice
and
the
fire
is
out
too
my
husband
and
his
men
had
been
at
work
in
a
distant
field
and
were
sheltering
themselves
under
a
shed
i
had
just
taken
some
water
to
them
when
the
storm
broke
when
they
saw
the
big
flash
and
heard
the
crash
they
knew
that
something
right
around
the
house
must
have
been
struck
they
ran
through
the
storm
as
fast
as
they
could
and
got
here
in
time
to
put
out
the
flames
and
jess
and
jimsy
and
and
that
other
young
fellow
why
they
never
felt
better
in
their
lives
came
jimsy
cheerful
voice
from
the
door
which
framed
beside
himself
jess
and
the
young
naval
officer
the
first
time
i
was
ever
knocked
out
by
lightning
declared
the
latter
and
really
it
quite
invigorating
jess
glided
across
the
room
to
peggy
side
and
threw
her
arms
about
her
neck
oh
peggy
how
brave
and
good
you
are
she
exclaimed
i
was
dreadfully
frightened
when
you
came
plunging
down
through
that
smoke
i
was
just
trying
to
make
my
way
through
it
with
a
bucket
when
you
came
toppling
down
the
stairs
i
managed
to
catch
you
and
support
you
into
the
kitchen
i
think
some
one
else
is
the
bravest
smiled
peggy
patting
her
shoulder
i
so
glad
that
the
baby
was
hurt
poor
little
thing
it
looked
so
cute
in
its
crib
i
remember
seizing
it
up
and
then
the
smoke
came
and
after
a
few
minutes
it
all
got
black
and
and
all
well
that
ends
well
declared
jimsy
capering
about
telephoned
to
your
home
to
roy
peggy
and
he
be
over
in
a
short
time
with
an
auto
but
what
about
the
asked
peggy
my
dear
girl
announced
jimsy
in
his
most
pompous
tones
it
would
be
impossible
for
you
to
guide
her
home
this
evening
your
nerves
would
not
stand
it
see
it
come
out
quite
fine
now
after
the
storm
and
roy
will
spin
you
home
in
the
machine
in
no
time
perhaps
that
would
be
best
agreed
peggy
and
i
can
come
out
or
roy
can
and
get
the
aeroplane
that
is
she
added
turning
to
the
farm
woman
if
it
wo
be
in
your
way
if
you
had
a
thousand
of
them
around
here
miss
they
would
be
in
our
way
came
in
a
hearty
gruff
tone
from
the
door
they
looked
up
to
see
a
big
looking
person
with
a
fringe
of
black
whiskers
running
under
his
chin
in
a
standing
there
this
is
my
husband
isaac
galloway
said
the
woman
introducing
the
owner
of
the
farm
at
your
service
gents
and
ladies
said
the
farmer
what
that
young
woman
did
fer
us
ther
ai
no
way
of
repaying
but
anything
ike
galloway
kin
do
any
time
ye
kin
count
on
him
fer
he
moved
toward
an
object
they
had
not
previously
noticed
an
iron
door
in
the
wall
turning
a
knob
this
way
and
that
he
presently
flung
it
open
revealing
the
inside
of
a
wall
safe
thrusting
his
hand
inside
he
drew
out
a
bundle
of
bills
then
closing
the
door
again
and
adjusting
the
combination
he
said
jes
goin
ter
give
ther
boys
a
bit
of
thank
you
fer
helpin
me
put
out
ther
fire
if
any
of
you
folks
would
like
oh
no
no
thank
you
laughed
peggy
sitting
up
and
feeling
except
for
a
slight
dizziness
almost
herself
again
very
well
no
harm
meant
said
the
farmer
as
he
shuffled
out
of
the
room
and
into
the
kitchen
where
he
distributed
his
largess
quite
an
idea
commented
jimsy
regarding
the
wall
safe
i
suppose
you
have
quite
a
lot
of
money
on
hand
at
times
and
it
is
safest
to
keep
it
so
he
added
addressing
the
farmer
wife
yep
was
the
rejoinder
ike
got
his
money
fer
his
corn
crop
ther
other
day
two
thousand
dollars
what
with
ther
corn
and
ther
early
apples
all
in
thar
except
what
he
jes
took
out
are
you
afraid
of
burglars
coming
and
blowing
the
door
of
the
safe
off
asked
peggy
lands
sakes
no
we
hear
besides
that
a
patent
safe
an
if
it
is
opened
without
a
knowledge
of
the
combination
it
would
take
a
plaguey
long
time
to
do
just
then
the
farmer
came
back
and
after
some
more
general
conversation
the
whir
of
an
approaching
automobile
announced
the
arrival
of
roy
the
lad
was
naturally
much
interested
in
the
doings
of
the
afternoon
as
excitedly
related
to
him
by
everybody
at
once
and
was
favorably
impressed
with
the
young
naval
officer
of
course
he
did
not
ask
him
his
opinion
of
the
prescott
aeroplane
but
from
remarks
lieut
bradbury
dropped
roy
gathered
that
he
was
much
pleased
with
its
performance
soon
afterward
jess
and
jimsy
shot
skyward
in
the
now
still
air
in
their
red
aeroplane
the
dragon
as
it
had
been
christened
and
amid
warm
farewells
from
the
farmer
and
his
wife
the
auto
buzzed
off
they
had
traversed
a
mile
or
more
when
on
rounding
a
corner
at
a
narrow
part
of
the
road
they
came
almost
against
another
machine
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
both
cars
were
compelled
to
slow
down
so
that
the
occupants
had
a
good
view
of
each
other
both
roy
and
peggy
were
considerably
astonished
to
see
that
the
oncoming
auto
was
occupied
by
old
harding
and
that
by
his
side
was
seated
none
other
than
the
man
known
as
eugene
mortlake
where
can
they
be
going
wondered
roy
as
old
man
harding
favored
them
with
a
scowl
in
passing
and
then
both
cars
resumed
their
normal
speed
i
noticed
that
this
is
a
private
road
leading
only
to
that
farm
rejoined
peggy
the
ends
there
then
that
must
be
their
destination
for
there
are
no
other
houses
on
this
road
looks
that
way
assented
roy
queer
is
it
very
responded
peggy
for
some
inexplicable
reason
as
the
girl
spoke
a
chill
ran
through
her
she
felt
a
dull
sense
of
foreboding
but
the
next
minute
she
shook
it
off
after
all
why
should
harding
and
mortlake
be
driving
to
the
farm
harding
financial
dealings
comprised
mortgages
in
every
part
of
the
island
it
was
quite
probable
that
the
farmer
was
in
some
way
involved
in
the
old
man
nets
possibly
that
was
the
reason
of
all
that
money
being
stored
in
the
wall
safe
refusing
courteously
an
invitation
extended
by
miss
prescott
to
spend
the
night
at
the
homestead
lieut
bradbury
was
driven
to
the
station
by
roy
after
they
had
dropped
peggy
and
just
managed
to
make
a
new
york
train
i
shall
be
back
he
said
and
have
a
look
at
machines
of
course
the
government
wants
to
give
everybody
a
fair
field
and
no
favors
oh
of
course
assented
roy
pondering
in
his
own
mind
what
sort
of
a
machine
this
mysterious
mortlake
craft
was
suddenly
there
flashed
across
his
mind
a
thought
that
had
not
occurred
to
him
hitherto
the
had
been
left
under
the
shed
at
the
farm
what
was
there
to
prevent
harding
and
mortlake
from
examining
it
and
acquainting
themselves
with
the
intricacies
of
the
mechanism
and
the
automatic
balancing
device
there
was
no
question
that
the
farm
must
have
been
their
destination
roy
blamed
himself
bitterly
for
not
foreseeing
this
he
had
half
a
mind
to
return
to
the
farm
and
bring
the
aeroplane
home
himself
but
it
was
growing
dark
and
a
distant
rumble
seemed
to
presage
the
return
of
the
afternoon
storm
anyhow
the
boy
thought
and
the
thought
consoled
him
all
those
devices
are
covered
by
patents
and
even
if
they
wanted
to
they
could
not
steal
them
and
yet
and
yet
but
the
storm
came
up
sharper
than
ever
that
evening
and
even
had
he
wished
to
roy
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
handle
the
aeroplane
alone
in
the
heavy
wind
that
came
now
in
puffs
and
now
in
a
steady
gale
so
roy
put
his
tiresome
thoughts
out
of
his
head
but
he
resolved
to
get
the
aeroplane
the
first
thing
the
following
morning
chapter
vii
a
case
for
the
authorities
it
was
just
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
that
a
big
automobile
skimmed
past
the
prescott
home
peggy
and
roy
saw
it
from
the
windows
why
that
sheriff
lawley
exclaimed
peggy
and
look
old
harding
is
with
him
and
that
mortlake
man
that
right
wonder
where
they
can
be
going
said
roy
sauntering
out
to
the
garage
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
giving
the
matter
little
more
thought
it
had
been
arranged
that
he
was
to
bring
the
aeroplane
back
that
morning
driving
over
with
peggy
jimsy
and
jess
in
the
car
and
skimming
home
in
the
while
a
part
of
the
party
brought
the
car
back
they
were
to
call
for
jess
and
jimsy
at
their
home
a
fine
residence
overlooking
the
sound
from
a
lofty
hill
jess
and
jimsy
were
waiting
for
them
and
almost
before
the
car
had
stopped
they
were
at
its
side
heard
the
news
asked
jimsy
breathlessly
no
what
is
it
demanded
peggy
eagerly
why
that
safe
at
the
was
robbed
last
night
all
the
money
was
taken
and
they
have
no
clue
to
the
thief
how
did
you
hear
of
it
asked
roy
incredulously
peggy
had
told
him
of
the
queer
wall
safe
the
told
one
of
the
servants
and
she
told
jess
strange
it
it
is
odd
agreed
roy
but
if
people
will
keep
their
money
in
such
places
it
is
hardly
surprising
if
they
lose
it
did
you
hear
any
details
no
but
no
doubt
we
shall
when
we
reach
the
put
in
jess
is
it
thrilling
though
not
very
thrilling
for
poor
galloway
who
lost
the
money
said
peggy
i
expect
he
did
make
it
any
too
easily
on
their
arrival
at
the
galloway
the
young
people
found
a
scene
of
great
excitement
the
sheriff
and
important
was
examining
several
farm
hands
beneath
one
of
the
big
elms
while
in
the
background
stood
the
farmer
and
his
wife
looking
somewhat
perplexed
as
well
as
worried
as
the
prescott
auto
drove
up
old
harding
in
his
usual
rusty
black
suit
rose
from
his
seat
under
the
elm
and
whispered
something
to
the
sheriff
the
mortlake
arose
also
all
three
turned
and
gazed
curiously
at
the
young
occupants
of
the
car
as
it
slowed
down
good
morning
and
galloway
cried
peggy
we
were
dreadfully
sorry
to
hear
of
your
loss
have
you
any
clue
yet
there
was
something
curiously
cold
in
the
woman
voice
as
she
replied
in
the
negative
her
husband
looked
sullen
and
merely
nodded
the
sheriff
now
rose
and
came
toward
the
machine
he
knew
all
the
young
folks
and
greeted
them
briefly
at
his
heels
pressed
old
harding
and
his
companion
they
whispered
in
the
sheriff
ear
as
he
advanced
and
seemed
to
be
urging
him
to
something
i
understand
that
you
folks
was
in
this
house
yesterday
afternoon
began
the
sheriff
abruptly
why
yes
during
the
storm
said
peggy
there
was
lieut
bradbury
of
the
united
states
navy
harding
and
mortlake
exchanged
annoyed
glances
this
was
confirmation
of
their
fears
yes
go
on
urged
the
sheriff
and
myself
and
bancroft
here
and
his
sister
and
later
my
brother
came
do
you
recall
the
safe
being
opened
while
you
were
in
the
room
i
presume
from
the
remark
you
made
when
you
drove
up
that
you
know
of
the
robbery
we
heard
of
it
at
the
bancroft
but
we
do
know
the
details
that
is
not
necessary
answer
my
questions
please
who
was
in
the
parlor
beside
yourself
when
galloway
opened
the
wall
safe
to
reward
the
men
who
had
helped
him
extinguish
the
fire
why
jimsy
i
mean
bancroft
his
sister
and
lieut
bradbury
beside
of
course
and
mrs
galloway
what
your
brother
was
not
there
certainly
not
he
did
come
till
later
then
your
brother
did
see
the
safe
opened
of
course
not
struck
in
roy
i
was
here
only
a
very
brief
time
but
what
does
all
this
mean
i
do
understand
it
means
that
you
are
cleared
of
a
grave
suspicion
said
the
sheriff
harding
and
galloway
brother
mortlake
here
her
brother
exclaimed
peggy
in
an
undertone
the
sheriff
went
on
seemed
to
have
an
idea
that
roy
prescott
was
here
at
the
time
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
intimate
that
but
old
harding
was
tugging
frantically
at
the
sheriff
arm
he
was
seconded
by
mortlake
interpreting
the
signals
aright
he
stopped
short
in
fact
it
looked
suspicious
he
concluded
lamely
he
turned
and
went
off
followed
by
harding
and
mortlake
how
did
you
ever
come
to
make
such
a
mistake
snarled
old
harding
as
they
walked
away
much
crestfallen
we
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
now
why
confound
it
all
retorted
mortlake
my
sister
mentioned
a
young
man
being
with
the
girl
in
the
aeroplane
and
i
took
it
for
granted
that
it
was
her
brother
and
a
nice
mess
you
got
us
both
into
with
your
it
for
granted
snorted
the
old
miserly
financier
of
sandy
beach
it
looks
as
if
we
got
ourselves
in
a
trap
now
nonsense
who
to
know
we
have
the
money
i
take
the
first
opportunity
to
send
it
back
and
no
more
will
be
heard
of
the
matter
lucky
i
did
hide
it
in
his
aeroplane
as
i
intended
to
do
yes
but
we
still
got
the
cub
as
our
rival
i
wish
i
could
think
of
some
plan
to
choke
him
off
that
scheme
of
yours
to
blame
the
robbery
on
him
would
have
been
all
right
if
you
only
made
sure
of
your
facts
first
do
worry
our
chance
will
come
yet
i
make
that
whole
outfit
regret
bitterly
that
they
ever
stole
a
march
on
us
by
kidnapping
that
officer
to
have
discredited
him
with
the
navy
would
have
been
the
best
way
however
said
old
harding
brusquely
i
find
a
way
to
do
that
yet
mortlake
promised
in
the
meantime
speculation
and
wonder
had
ruled
among
the
occupants
of
roy
auto
everything
seemed
very
much
muddled
but
one
fact
stood
out
clearly
and
that
was
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
cast
suspicion
if
not
the
actual
guilt
of
the
robbery
upon
roy
for
what
object
i
have
it
cried
peggy
suddenly
if
they
could
have
placed
roy
under
a
cloud
of
suspicion
it
would
have
worked
to
his
discredit
with
the
naval
authorities
and
might
have
resulted
in
our
aeroplane
being
denied
a
place
in
the
trials
that
seems
plain
enough
they
all
agreed
that
it
did
but
jimsy
said
suddenly
if
that
was
the
case
why
did
they
try
to
make
out
that
i
stole
it
because
forgive
me
jimsy
you
not
roy
without
him
the
tests
of
the
prescott
aeroplane
could
hardly
be
conducted
unless
unless
a
certain
young
person
named
peggy
prescott
undertook
to
take
charge
of
them
cried
jess
loyally
do
be
foolish
jess
warned
peggy
but
look
here
is
galloway
coming
to
speak
to
us
the
farmer
wife
approached
the
automobile
from
which
none
of
the
party
had
as
yet
alighted
she
was
followed
by
her
husband
both
began
apologizing
profusely
for
the
questions
of
the
sheriff
but
land
sakes
alive
exclaimed
the
farmer
wife
i
declar
ter
goodness
we
bin
so
flustered
thet
i
don
know
no
more
than
a
wet
hen
my
brother
that
mortlake
was
dead
sot
on
it
bein
one
of
you
folks
but
i
knew
that
was
reediculous
they
hardly
knew
whether
to
be
angry
or
to
laugh
at
the
woman
blunt
frankness
but
roy
struck
in
with
a
question
was
mortlake
accompanied
by
harding
out
here
last
night
why
yes
said
the
woman
with
perfect
candor
they
stayed
quite
a
while
harding
hed
some
business
with
ike
an
an
gene
mortlake
said
he
like
ter
hev
a
look
at
yer
aeroplane
yer
know
he
in
thet
thar
business
hisself
volunteered
ike
confidentially
peggy
felt
as
if
she
could
have
groaned
aloud
roy
fears
earlier
confided
to
her
seemed
to
have
been
based
on
a
true
presentiment
the
mortlake
had
undoubtedly
improved
his
opportunity
to
study
the
at
close
range
the
farmer
next
words
confirmed
her
reckon
he
was
powerful
interested
too
the
farmer
went
on
fer
he
made
a
lot
uv
ther
nicest
droorings
you
ever
seen
an
why
what
the
trouble
for
roy
hardly
knowing
what
he
intended
to
do
had
jumped
from
the
machine
and
was
sprinting
toward
the
harding
car
but
as
he
neared
it
the
old
financier
who
with
mortlake
was
already
seated
in
the
tonneau
spoke
a
word
in
the
chauffeur
ear
and
the
machine
dashed
off
leaving
roy
enraged
and
nonplussed
too
bad
roy
breathed
peggy
as
rather
crestfallen
the
lad
returned
oh
i
do
know
sis
even
if
they
had
sneaked
off
like
that
and
caught
the
machine
i
guess
i
have
been
like
the
dog
that
chased
the
train
i
would
have
known
what
to
do
with
it
when
i
got
it
but
roy
their
flight
confirms
their
guilt
i
know
sis
but
what
possible
way
have
we
to
prove
it
the
rascals
have
covered
up
their
tracks
cleverly
a
sudden
thought
struck
peggy
and
she
turned
to
the
farmer
did
any
of
those
bills
have
an
identifying
mark
on
it
she
asked
the
farmer
shook
his
head
but
galloway
had
a
better
memory
why
yes
ike

that
the

were
to

to
town
in

the

following
them
as
closely
as
possible
from
above
as
they
chugged
out
of
the
gate
and
on
to
the
rough
road
peggy
thoughts
kept
time
to
the
rhythmic
pulsations
of

mortlake
loses
some
drawings
dashing
along
the
rough
country
road
with
every
sense
on
the
alert
peggy
found
mental
occupation
enough
to
drive
gloomier
thoughts
from
her
mind
the
prescott
car
was
a
good
one
with
a
powerful
motor
and
splendidly
upholstered
it
was
painted
a
dark
blue
and
was
known
in
the
surrounding
country
as
the
blue
bird
it
had
been
purchased
with
the
money
made
by
the
brother
and
sister
from
their
shares
in
james
desert
mine
far
above
them
sailed
the
aeroplane
its
two
occupants
from
time
to
time
waving
at
their
pretty
sisters
below
but
in
the
currents
it
would
have
been
dangerous
to
drive
at
a
pace
slow
enough
to
keep
level
with
the
automobile
and
so
the
aeroplane
soon
dashed
on
ahead
from
time
to
time
however
it
made
circles
and
swoops
which
brought
it
sometimes
in
seemingly
dangerous
closeness
to
the
all
at
once
peggy
stopped
the
automobile
with
a
jerk
which
almost
threw
jess
who
was
unprepared
for
the
shock
out
of
the
car
good
gracious
peggy
what
are
you
trying
to
do
she
gasped
look
cried
peggy
pointing
with
wide
eyes
in
the
center
of
the
road
lay
a
bundle
of
papers
secured
with
a
rubber
band
somebody
has
dropped
something
from
another
auto
or
a
wagon
cried
jess
i
think
so
said
peggy
in
excited
tones
as
she
descended
from
the
car
and
i
an
idea
that
these
papers
have
been
dropped
from
car
it
must
have
been
the
only
one
to
pass
here
recently
as
this
road
runs
direct
to
the
farm
and
nowhere
else
she
stooped
down
in
the
road
and
picked
up
the
bundle
and
then
with
a
beating
heart
she
opened
it
but
for
an
inward
intuition
of
what
its
contents
would
prove
to
be
peggy
with
her
rigid
ideas
of
honor
could
not
have
brought
herself
to
do
this
as
her
eyes
fell
on
the
first
sheet
and
she
saw
that
it
was
covered
with
annotations
and
sketches
she
gave
a
little
cry
oh
jess
the
luck
the
wonderful
wonderful
luck
why
what
is
it
a
bundle
of
bills
or
it
is
that
or
anything
cried
peggy
it
oh
jess
it
the
sketches
and
plans
of
our
aeroplane
that
mortlake
and
his
accomplice
harding
were
spiriting
away
they
must
have
dropped
them
from
their
automobile
said
jess
or
more
likely
from
the
pockets
of
one
of
them
see
the
ground
is
trampled
about
here
it
looks
to
me
as
if
they
had
had
a
and
were
fixing
it
when
the
papers
fell
out
and
were
left
behind
unnoticed
oh
what
a
bit
of
luck
if
they
had
had
those
papers
it
would
have
meant
a
shrill
cry
from
jess
interrupted
her
at
the
same
moment
peggy
became
conscious
of
a
presence
behind
her
she
wheeled
sharply
and
found
herself
facing
two
individuals
one
of
whom
carried
a
heavy
cudgel
their
clothes
and
broken
boots
and
their
leering
odious
appearance
at
once
proclaimed
them
of
the
genus
tramp

growled
one
of
the
men
with
an
ugly
leer

he
held

while

with

toward
the
car
frum

peggy
reply
was
to
leap
nimbly
into
the
machine
but
to
her
horror
the
two
tramps
followed
instantly
jess
cowered
back
in
her
seat
her
pale
lips
moved
but
she
said
nothing
tell
yer
wot
burst
out
the
man
with
the
club

bones
a
piece
the
money

much
to
folks
like
you
an
we
let
yer
go
if
not
a
sudden
inspiration
came
to
peggy
a
flash
of
recollection
why
did
you
say
that
before
she
said
cheerfully
i
be
glad
to
give
you
the
money
wait
a
minute
while
i
get
it
out
she
raised
the
cushion
of
the
front
bucket
seat
and
dived
beneath
it
with
one
hand
the
men
watched
her
with
greedy
yet
suspicious
eyes
ai
tryin
ter
fool
us
are
yer
growled
one
of
them
ef
you
air
he
raised
his
club
threateningly
just
as
peggy
hand
withdrew
from
beneath
the
cushion
something
bright
flashed
in
it
look
out
mike
she
got
a
gun
shouted
one
of
the
men
falling
back
the
other
whipped
a
hand
amidst
his
rags
and
was
just
about
to
aim
a
pistol
when
from
the
shiny
object
peggy
held
in
her
hand
a
fine
stream
of
some
sort
of
liquid
jetted
forcibly
the
fellow
with
the
gun
threw
his
hands
up
to
his
face
and
dropping
the
pistol
staggered
back
with
a
howl
of
agony
the
other
darted
off
without
even
looking
at
him
the
air
was
filled
with
a
pungent
scent
of
ammonia
and
a
quiet
smile
of
triumph
curled
peggy
red
lips
as
she
started
the
car
in
motion
once
more
oh
peggy
how
brave
you
are
gasped
jess
whatever
was
that
you
used
i
hope
the
poor
man
is
badly
hurt
although
he
was
so
horrid
i
just
remembered
in
time
jess
dear
said
peggy
as
she
sped
the
car
along
that
we
had
under
the
seat
an
ammonia
pistol
for
use
on
vicious
dogs
i
used
it
on
another
sort
of
a
dog
that
all
and
it
proved
equally
effective
just
at
this
moment
peggy
turned
out
to
avoid
another
car
that
was
approaching
them
from
the
opposite
direction
in
a
second
she
saw
that
it
carried
harding
and
mortlake
they
both
looked
angry
and
blank
peggy
guessed
at
once
that
they
had
discovered
their
loss
but
she
resolved
not
to
stop
unless
they
did
and
asked
questions
she
felt
that
such
a
despicable
act
as
they
had
attempted
to
perpetrate
deserved
no
help
on
her
part
hey
there
shouted
old
harding
as
his
car
was
slowed
down
by
the
chauffeur
hey
stop
i
want
to
speak
to
you
he
polite
about
it
is
he
whispered
jess
are
you
going
to
tell
him
peggy
not
rejoined
peggy
with
a
tightening
of
her
lips
why
should
i
he
tried
to
fasten
a
theft
on
my
brother
this
morning
and
then
caps
the
climax
by
instigating
mortlake
to
try
to
steal
the
ideas
of
our
aeroplane
hey
girls
seen
a
package
on
the
road
bawled
old
harding
as
peggy
slowed
up
and
stopped
i
recovered
some
of
my
own
property
if
that
is
what
you
mean
said
peggy
slowly
a
dull
flush
rising
to
her
cheeks
well
well
what
d
mean
by
that
hey
what
d
mean
by
that
you
may
construe
it
any
way
you
wish
to
harding
was
the
cold
rejoinder
and
to
avoid
further
questioning
peggy
sped
up
her
machine
and
soon
vanished
in
a
cloud
of
dust
the
old
financier
turned
to
his
companion
with
a
look
of
disgusted
amazement
what
d
think
of
that
hey
mortlake
he
snapped
out
what
d
think
of
that
fine
young
girls
eh
nice
products
of
the
twentieth
century
hey
oh
let
get
on
and
see
if
we
ca
find
that
roll
of
papers
somewhere
along
here
rejoined
mortlake
impatiently
i
do
think
it
likely
they
could
have
seen
it
it
must
have
fallen
from
my
pocket
where
the
car
broke
down
and
i
got
out
hey
oh
yes
yes
that
it
drive
on
tom
drive
us
to
where
the
car
broke
down
in
a
few
seconds
they
reached
the
spot
just
in
time
to
see
the
two
tramps
who
had
molested
the
girls
making
off
there
they
go
shouted
mortlake
those
fellows
must
have
found
them
i
would
lose
those
sketches
for
a
thousand
dollars
put
on
more
speed
tom
and
overtake
them
the
chauffeur
did
as
he
was
bid
and
the
car
leaped
ahead
in
a
few
chugs
it
had
reached
the
tramps
side
they
having
stopped
bewildered
in
the
meantime
why
blow
me
bill
said
one
to
the
other
as
the
car
came
up
if
it
ai
the
gents
as
drove
down
the
road
a
while
ago
give
me
those
papers
you
rascals
shouted
mortlake
almost
flinging
himself
out
of
the
car
give
them
to
me
or
hold
your
horses
hold
your
hosses
counseled
the
hobo
who
had
received
the
dose
of
ammonia
and
whose
eyes
were
still
red
from
its
effects
wot
papers
might
you
be
lookin
fer
asked
this
fellow
cautiously
although
he
knew
very
well
a
bundle
of
papers
i
dropped
panted
mortlake
did
you
find
them
naw
grunted
the
tramp
naw
echoed
the
other
be
careful
what
you
say
if
you
are
lying
it
will
go
hard
with
you
the
warning
came
from
old
harding
we
know
that
but
we
ai
got
search
us
if
yer
like
the
knights
of
the
road
spread
their
arms
to
signify
their
willingness
to
be
searched
mortlake
groaned
it
was
evident
that
neither
of
the
tatterdermalions
had
the
papers
but
what
had
become
of
them
in
his
distress
and
chagrin
mortlake
gave
an
audible
groan
this
the
tramps
seemed
to
construe
as
a
favorable
sign
one
winked
to
the
other
and
the
one
spoke
wots
it
worth
if
we
tell
yer
where
them
papers
are
both
what
you
know
cried
mortlake
while
old
harding
spluttered
eh
eh
hey
what
all
this
what
all
this
i
did
say
we
knew
was
the
cunning
reply
i
said
what
it
worth
if
we
did
know
mortlake
drew
out
a
bill
is
this
enough
he
asked
the
tramps
eyes
rounded
as
they
gazed
at
the
figure
satisfactory
said
red
eyes
well
where
are
those
papers
then
snapped
mortlake
impatiently

thar
purty
gal
wot
jest

by
in
an
autermobubble
has
what
yes
we
saw
her
pick
them
up
out
of
the
road
we
tried
to
convince
her

was
dishonest
to
keep
but
she
would
listen
to
us
you
done
well
and
seem
to
be
bright
fellows
said
mortlake
handing
over
the
bill
to
red
eyes
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
of
the
two
by
the
way
you
do

about
here

the
worthy
pair
shuffled
off
up
the
road
while
mortlake
turned
to
harding
with
a
shrug
there
are
two
tools
made
to
our
hand
we
may
find
them
very
useful
i
agree
with
you
was
the
dry
and
rasping
reply
at
least
they
have
put
us
in
possession
of
one
valuable
bit
of
knowledge
hey
chapter
ix
the
flight
of
the
silver
cobweb
a
week
rolled
slowly
by
a
week
of
suspense
during
which
they
had
one
or
two
calls
from
lieut
bradbury
who
had
been
busy
down
at
the
mortlake
plant
but
the
officer
was
naturally
noncommittal
concerning
his
opinion
of
the
comparative
merits
of
the
two
types
of
aeroplanes
equally
naturally
of
course
the
young
prescotts
had
not
questioned
him
concerning
them
but
during
this
week
they
had
had
a
glimpse
of
the
mortlake
machine
in
flight
one
still
breathless
morning
the
air
had
been
filled
soon
after
dawn
with
a
vibrant
buzzing
sound
which
peggy
trained
ear
had
recognized
as
the
song
of
an
aeroplane
engine
she
hastened
to
her
brother
room
and
rapped
upon
the
door
in
reply
to
his
sleepy
query
the
girl
rapidly
told
him
of
what
she
had
heard
window
faced
on
the
road
and
a
glance
satisfied
him
that
the
mortlake
machine
was
to
have
its
first
hastily
as
he
dressed
however
he
found
that
peggy
was
before
him
on
the
dewy
lawn
field
glasses
in
hand
down
the
road
could
be
seen
in
front
of
the
mortlake
plant
a
small
crowd
of
mechanics
with
one
or
two
dominant
figures
moving
among
them
with
the
glasses
they
had
no
difficulty
in
making
out
mortlake
figure
and
the
slender
upright
form
of
lieut
bradbury
all
at
once
the
group
opened
up
a
bit
and
they
saw
a
silvery
glittering
aeroplane
agleam
with
new
aluminum
paint
throbbing
and
vibrating
as
if
anxious
to
be
off
blue
smoke
eddied
up
as
the
motor
roared
and
whirred
the
air
seemed
to
vibrate
under
the
sound
as
if
a
battery
of
gatling
guns
had
been
discharged
fascinated
brother
and
sister
watched
the
spectacle
intently
they
saw
mortlake
clamber
heavily
into
the
machine
followed
by
lieut
bradbury
a
mechanic
started
for
the
front
of
the
plane
and
began
swinging
the
propeller
at
least
they
have
cribbed
our
device
exclaimed
peggy
as
she
saw
the
next
instant
the
propeller
became
a
whirring
blur
and
the
aeroplane
after
a
brief
preliminary
run
began
to
climb
upward
the
morning
sun
caught
its
silvered
planes
and
turned
them
to
gold
it
was
a
beautiful
and
inspiring
sight
even
with
all
that
lay
at
stake
peggy
and
roy
could
not
deny
the
machine
a
meed
of
praise
it
was
in
its
delicacy
of
construction
and
speedy
as
a
flash
thundering
like
an
express
train
it
dashed
above
the
prescott
home
leaving
in
its
wake
the
pungent
odor
of
burning
the
most
suitable
lubricant
for
aeroplanes
then
suddenly
as
if
a
recollection
of
peggy
mischievous
flight
of
a
few
days
previously
had
occurred
to
him
mortlake
swung
the
delicate
silvery
machine
about
and
dashed
straight
down
at
the
boy
and
girl
standing
by
the
garden
gate
so
close
to
their
heads
did
he
skim
in
his
desire
to
show
off
that
he
almost
came
too
low
for
one
instant
it
looked
as
if
the
machine
would
be
dashed
to
a
premature
end
but
it
recovered
buoyancy
like
a
racing
yacht
and
tore
upward
into
the
sky
at
an
increased
speed
let
get
out
the
and
follow
the
cobweb
cried
roy
the
name
occurring
to
him
in
a
flash
of
inspiration
as
he
watched
the
filmy
outlines
of
the
other
aeroplane
melt
in
the
distance
oh
roy
what
a
pretty
name
is
it
but
somehow
i
like
best
our
machine
may
be
a
bit
heavier
but
solidity
counts
in
hard
service
scarcely
ten
minutes
later
and
while
mortlake
mechanics
and
assistants
were
still
craning
their
necks
skyward
another
aeroplane
a
yellow
adventurer
of
the
skies
thundered
upward
not
to
be
outdone
by
mortlake
roy
who
was
at
the
wheel
swooped
above
the
rival
crowd
they
did
not
take
it
with
a
good
grace
remarks
of
which
they
could
not
catch
the
wording
but
only
the
menacing
intonation
were
hurled
upward
at
them
they
received
them
with
a
laugh
and
a
wave
of
the
hand
which
did
not
put
the
mortlake
crowd
into
any
better
humor
and
then
with
a
graceful
swinging
curve
that
banked
the
machine
almost
on
its
beam
ends
they
were
up
off
and
away
in
pursuit
of
the
which
by
this
time
was
a
mere
of
a
dot
on
the
horizon
do
you
think
we
can
overhaul
her
roy
ventured
peggy
as
they
raced
through
the
air
the
fresh
breath
of
morning
coming
refreshingly
in
their
faces
not
a
chance
admitted
roy
cheerfully
but
they
turn
after
a
while
i
guess
and
then
we
try
the
against
the
but
they
kept
on
and
on
unrelentingly
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
diminution
of
speed
on
the
part
of
the
nor
did
the
other
aircraft
give
any
indication
that
she
was
preparing
to
put
about
below
them
farms
meadows
villages
and
crowds
of
wondering
country
folk
swam
by
in
an
panorama
the
earth
beneath
them
looked
like
a
big
saucer
divided
up
into
brown
red
and
green
squares
with
tiny
dots
running
and
walking
about
all
at
once
roy
gave
a
shout
and
pointed
dead
ahead
and
not
more
than
a
few
miles
distant
lay
a
silvery
gleaming
streak
the
sea
the
exclamation
came
simultaneously
from
peggy
and
roy
they
had
been
traveling
due
south
across
the
island
and
now
the
broad
atlantic
lay
stretched
beyond
the
land
shimmering
in
the
sunlight
far
off
they
could
make
out
the
black
smoke
of
a
steamer
hovering
above
the
ocean
a
mail
boat
making
for
new
york
announced
roy
so
fast
were
they
traveling
that
by
this
time
they
could
plainly
make
out
the
ocean
which
from
a
silvery
streak
was
now
changed
into
a
rolling
expanse
of
salt
water
and
still
the
kept
on
and
gave
no
sign
of
turning
nor
for
that
matter
had
her
speed
diminished
appreciably
the
rival
aeroplane
was
now
skimming
above
the
water
at
a
height
of
about
a
thousand
feet
the
maintained
about
the
same
altitude
but
the
gap
between
the
two
aerial
craft
was
not
closing
up
mortlake
taking
a
desperate
chance
to
show
lieut
bradbury
what
the
can
do
exclaimed
roy
with
a
new
engine
he
risking
too
much
i
guess
he
seen
us
and
means
to
beat
us
out
at
all
hazards
conjectured
peggy
and
she
was
right
mortlake
glancing
back
a
short
time
before
the
sea
appeared
on
the
horizon
had
seen
the
other
aeroplane
and
guessing
at
once
what
its
appearance
meant
had
determined
to
keep
on
even
at
the
risk
of
plunging
himself
and
his
passenger
into
the
sea
that
was
mortlake
character
he
was
a
man
who
could
brook
no
rivalry
used
all
his
life
to
sweep
obstacles
aside
he
would
rather
have
terminated
his
career
than
permit
any
one
to
pass
him
in
the
race
for
first
place
no
matter
in
what
line
that
first
place
might
lie
are
you
going
to
keep
on
roy
the
question
came
as
a
strip
of
white
beach
flashed
beneath
them
and
peggy
peering
over
the
edge
of
the
chassis
saw
the
big
atlantic
swells
rolling
below
them
the
thunder
of
the
surf
on
the
beach
came
clearly
to
their
ears
even
at
that
height
what
do
you
think
sis
we
got
lots
of
gasoline
the
motor
is
working
without
a
hitch
i
hate
to
turn
back
now
particularly
with
that
officer
eyes
upon
us
as
in
all
probability
they
are
oh
let
keep
on
exclaimed
peggy
casting
prudence
to
the
winds
i
feel
like
you
roy
if
we
turn
back
now
it
would
look
as
if
we
were
afraid
to
trust
the
above
the
ocean
and
after
all
it
is
a
naval
contest
that
we
hope
to
be
elected
for
forward
it
is
then
cried
roy
exultingly
the
tang
of
the
salt
wind
the
inspiration
of
the
ocean
had
come
to
him
he
felt
like
a
corsair
a
very
modern
corsair
urging
his
craft
above
the
ancient
sea
the
vessel
whose
smoke
they
had
espied
at
a
distance
was
quite
close
to
them
now
a
huge
black
hull
with
white
passenger
decks
rising
tier
on
tier
four
huge
red
funnels
with
black
tops
and
slender
masts
between
which
hung
the
aerials
of
her
wireless
apparatus
her
bow
was
creaming
up
the
ocean
into
foam
as
she
rushed
onward
at
a
knot
gait
roy
obeying
a
daring
impulse
let
the
descend
now
they
could
see
her
promenade
decks
lined
with
white
faces
peering
upward
here
and
there
the
sun
glinted
on
the
bright
metal
work
of
cameras
all
aimed
at
the
wonderful
spectacle
of
the
soaring
buoyant
oh
if
only
we
could
drop
a
message
on
her
decks
breathed
peggy
eagerly
i
do
wish
we
had
a
or
something
by
ginger
cried
roy
suddenly
i
do
believe
i
got
some
in
my
i
bought
some
in
the
village
yesterday
to
mail
to
the
chaps
back
at
school
yes
here
they
are
and
here
a
now
write
all
you
want
peggy
took
the
cards
her
brother
handed
to
her
with
his
free
hand
and
with
the
sat
down
to
compose
some
messages
after
a
few
seconds
thought
she
began
to
write
busily
card
after
card
was
covered
with
her
neat
penmanship
all
this
time
roy
had
kept
the
hovering
above
the
liner
from
time
to
time
taking
swoops
and
dives
around
it
like
some
monstrous
sea
gull
suddenly
from
the
liner
whistle
a
great
cascade
of
white
steam
spouted
it
was
the
vessel
siren
blowing
a
greeting
to
the
young
adventurers
of
the
air
at
the
same
instant
a
roar
a
cheer
from
cabin
and
steerage
passengers
alike
winged
its
way
upward
roy
acknowledged
it
by
a
graceful
wave
of
his
cap
then
the
cheering
broke
forth
afresh
the
passengers
of
the
newest
ocean
giant
the
realized
that
they
were
seeing
a
spectacle
that
would
remain
in
their
memories
all
their
lives
having
conquered
old
ocean
with
leviathan
vessels
man
was
now
seeking
to
subdue
the
air
to
his
utility
chapter
x
an
aerial
post
office
peggy
addressed
half
a
dozen
cards
two
of
course
went
to
jess
and
jimsy
another
to
aunt
sallie
prescott
one
to
the
captain
of
the
and
one
other
which
bore
the
address
eugene
mortlake
esq
it
was
a
mischievous
freak
that
made
peggy
write
this
last
missive
which
read
to
eugene
mortlake
per
steamer
in
greetings
from
aeroplane
prescott
that
was
all
but
peggy
knew
that
it
would
serve
its
prankish
purpose
all
this
time
the
had
been
out
at
sea
but
now
apparently
detecting
the
maneuvers
of
the
she
headed
about
and
came
racing
back
peggy
deftly
attached
weights
spare
bolts
from
the
tool
locker
to
each
of
the
cards
and
then
snatching
up
a
megaphone
she
hailed
the
uniformed
figures
on
the
bridge
of
the
great
vessel
below
them
will
you
be
good
enough
to
mail
some
letters
for
us
with
pleasure
came
the
reply
in
a
big
bellowing
british
voice
from
one
of
the
stalwart
figures
beneath
all
right
roy
come
down
as
low
as
you
dare
cried
peggy
catching
her
bundle
of
mail
roy
threw
over
a
couple
of
levers
and
turned
a
valve
instantly
the
began
to
drop
in
long
beautiful
arc
she
shot
by
above
the
liner
bridge
at
a
height
of
not
more
than
fifteen
feet
at
the
correct
moment
peggy
dropped
the
weighted
bundle
overboard
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
one
of
the
officers
catch
it
the
gallant
officers
now
realizing
for
the
first
time
that
a
girl
and
a
pretty
one
was
one
of
the
passengers
of
the
big
aeroplane
waved
their
hats
and
bowed
profoundly
and
peggy
what
would
aunt
sallie
have
said
peggy
blew
them
a
kiss
but
then
as
she
told
jess
later
i
was
in
an
aeroplane
my
dear
a
sort
of
an
unattainable
possibility
in
fact
in
the
meantime
mortlake
in
the
had
been
duly
mystified
as
to
what
the
was
about
when
she
swooped
downward
on
the
steamer
for
one
instant
the
thought
flashed
across
him
that
they
were
disabled
an
unholy
glee
filled
him
at
the
thought
if
only
the
were
to
come
to
grief
right
under
lieut
bradbury
eyes
it
would
be
a
great
feather
in
the
cap
of
the
machine
but
to
his
chagrin
he
saw
them
rise
the
next
instant
as
cleverly
as
ever
lieut
bradbury
who
had
been
watching
the
maneuver
of
the
gave
an
admiring
gasp
as
he
witnessed
the
daring
feat
good
heavens
he
exclaimed
and
the
evident
note
of
astonishment
and
appreciation
in
his
tones
did
not
tend
to
increase
the
pesky
brats
he
muttered
to
himself
we
got
to
do
something
to
put
them
out
of
the
race
there
is
another
aeroplane
that
i
fear
except
that
bothersome
kids
machine
and
there
and
then
mortlake
began
to
hatch
up
a
scheme
that
in
the
near
future
was
to
come
very
nearly
proving
disastrous
to
peggy
and
roy
and
their
high
hopes
magnificently
handled
do
you
think
so
mortlake
inquired
the
naval
officer
the
next
instant
yes
very
clever
agreed
mortlake
far
too
smart
to
show
his
inward
feelings
or
to
wear
his
heart
upon
his
sleeve
very
neat
but
i
can
do
the
same
thing
if
you
care
to
see
it
the
naval
officer
glanced
at
the
puffy
features
of
his
companion
and
his
thick
neck
no
thanks
he
said
i
got
to
be
getting
back
there
another
type
of
machine
i
got
to
look
over
out
at
mineola
it
is
really
necessary
that
i
reach
there
as
quickly
as
possible
very
well
said
mortlake
inwardly
relieved
as
he
did
much
fancy
duplicating
roy
feat
we
head
straight
on
for
the
shore
if
you
please
but
what
was
the
doing
as
the
steamer
raced
onward
that
aerial
wonder
had
swung
in
a
spiral
and
was
now
seemingly
hovering
about
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
as
the
two
aeroplanes
drew
abreast
mortlake
muttered
something
and
bent
over
his
engines
the
leaped
forward
like
an
unleashed
greyhound
but
the
was
close
on
her
heels
and
making
almost
as
good
time
mortlake
plunged
his
hands
in
among
the
machinery
and
readjusted
the
air
valve
of
the
carburetor
another
increase
of
speed
resulted
the
indicator
crawled
up
to
and
then
to
seventy
miles
an
hour
pressing
her
a
bit
are
you
asked
the
officer
as
they
seemed
to
hurtle
through
the
air
so
fast
did
they
rush
onward
oh
no
she
built
for
speed
responded
mortlake
with
a
gratified
grin
she
leave
any
such
old
lumber
wagon
as
that
prescott
machine
miles
behind
her
any
day
in
the
week
this
seemed
to
be
true
the
making
about
sixty
miles
was
being
rapidly
left
behind
i
should
think
you
be
afraid
of
overheating
your
cylinders
volunteered
the
lieutenant
now
this
was
just
what
mortlake
was
afraid
of
but
as
has
been
said
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
in
sporting
parlance
was
willing
always
to
take
a
chance
to
beat
any
one
he
considered
his
rival
he
was
taking
a
desperate
chance
now
under
the
artificial
means
he
had
used
to
increase
the
speed
of
his
engines
the
motor
was
turning
up
several
hundred
more
revolutions
a
minute
than
she
had
been
built
for
now
they
shot
above
the
strip
of
white
beach
and
below
them
the
pleasant
and
patches
of
verdant
woods
began
to
show
once
more
all
at
once
the
sign
for
which
mortlake
had
been
watching
so
anxiously
manifested
itself
a
tiny
curl
of
smoke
ascended
from
one
of
the
a
smell
of
blistering
burning
paint
was
wafted
back
to
the
nostrils
of
lieut
bradbury
i
thought
so
he
said
overheating
already
better
slow
down
mortlake
mortlake
glanced
back
the
much
diminished
in
size
now
by
the
distance
still
hung
doggedly
on
his
heels
i
give
her
more
air
he
vouchsafed
stubbornly
that
ought
to
cool
her
off
a
bit
that
and
advanced
spark
he
manipulated
the
necessary
levers
but
before
many
minutes
it
became
apparent
that
if
urged
at
that
rate
the
would
never
reach
sandy
beach
without
a
had
you
better
shut
down
a
bit
that
paint
blistering
as
if
the
cylinders
were
much
as
he
disliked
to
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
aeroplane
the
young
officer
felt
that
it
was
necessary
that
some
means
should
be
taken
to
compel
mortlake
to
reduce
speed
if
the
engine
became
so
overheated
that
it
stopped
in
they
might
be
caught
in
a
nasty
position
where
it
might
be
impossible
to
volplane
or
glide
downward
without
the
aid
of
the
engine
it
all
right
i
tell
you
said
mortlake
stubbornly
we
beat
those
cubs
into
sandy
beach
or
or
what
was
destined
never
to
be
known
for
at
that
instant
with
a
splutter
and
a
sigh
the
overheated
engines
almost
at
a
stopped
short
the
propeller
ceased
to
revolve
and
the
aeroplane
began
to
plunge
downward
with
fearful
velocity
but
mortlake
no
matter
what
his
other
faults
possessed
a
cool
head
the
instant
he
lost
control
of
the
motor
he
seized
the
warping
levers
and
began
manipulating
them
at
the
same
time
he
set
the
rudder
so
as
to
bring
the
to
earth
in
a
series
of
long
spirals
the
maneuver
was
that
of
volplaning
and
has
been
performed
successfully
by
several
aviators
whose
engines
have
suddenly
ceased
to
work
while
in
the
young
officer
watched
approvingly
whatever
else
mortlake
might
be
and
lieut
bradbury
had
not
taken
a
violent
fancy
to
him
he
was
a
master
of
the
aerial
craft
despite
the
mishap
to
the
engine
caused
by
his
own
carelessness
mortlake
managed
to
bring
the
to
a
gentle
landing
in
a
broad
flat
meadow
inhabited
by
some
spotted
cows
which
fled
in
undignified
panic
as
the
monster
silent
now
swooped
down
like
a
bolt
from
the
blue
the
instant
the
came
to
rest
mortlake
restless
eyes
glanced
upward
he
was
hoping
against
all
common
sense
that
the
young
prescotts
had
not
seen
his
mishap
or
at
least
that
they
would
pass
on
above
him
unnoticing
his
first
glance
showed
him
the
still
steadily
plugging
along
and
a
moment
later
it
became
apparent
that
they
had
seen
the
sudden
descent
of
the
for
the
aeroplane
was
seen
to
dip
and
glide
lower
much
as
a
mousing
hawk
can
be
seen
to
do
hard
luck
murmured
the
young
naval
officer
as
mortlake
who
had
clambered
out
of
the
machine
stamped
and
fumed
by
its
side
inwardly
lieut
bradbury
was
thinking
how
stubborn
men
invariably
meet
with
some
mishap
or
accident
yes
beastly
hard
luck
agreed
mortlake
readily
i
see
a
over
there
though
the
other
side
of
those
trees
i
guess
i
can
get
a
bucket
and
some
water
over
there
once
i
cooled
those
cylinders
off
we
be
all
right
how
long
will
that
take
do
you
think
inquired
the
officer
pulling
out
his
watch
and
a
not
more
than
half
an
hour
it
should
take
that
that
means
i
miss
my
train
if
we
do
get
into
sandy
beach
by
eleven
i
ca
possibly
make
it
and
there
not
another
from
there
for
two
hours
that
would
make
me
late
for
my
appointment
at
mineola
mortlake
face
fell
here
was
a
bit
of
hard
luck
with
a
vengeance
it
might
cost
him
a
place
in
the
contests
we
can
make
up
time
once
we
get
under
way
he
said
tentatively
that
is
it
i
dare
risk
it
i
wonder
if
i
can
get
an
automobile
or
some
sort
of
a
conveyance
about
here
not
a
chance
i
know
this
neighborhood
it
is
very
sparsely
settled
a
sudden
whir
above
them
caused
them
both
to
look
up
it
was
the
swooping

an
accident
shouted
down
roy
what
do
you
think
you
can
see
we
not
flying
ca
you
bellowed
mortlake
his
face
crimson
with
anger
and
mortification
can
we
do
anything
to
help
you
came
from
peggy
ignoring
the
insulting
tones
no
yes
the
first
monosyllable
came
from
mortlake
the
second
from
lieut
bradbury
if
you
do
mind
accepting
a
passenger
i
should
be
glad
of
a
lift
to
sandy
beach
i
got
to
make
a
train
explained
the
young
officer
in
five
minutes
the
was
on
the
sward
beside
the
crippled
mortlake
face
was
black
as
night
he
fulminated
maledictions
on
the
young
aviators
who
had
appeared
at
for
him
such
an
inopportune
moment
can
i
help
you
fix
the
machine
asked
roy
pleasantly
there
nothing
serious
the
matter
is
there
not
a
thing
asserted
mortlake
it
all
the
fault
of
the
men
who
made
the
carburetor
they
did
a
bungling
bit
of
work
and
the
cylinders
have
overheated
can
we
leave
a
message
for
you
at
your
shops
or
would
you
like
a
lift
home
with
us
asked
roy
who
felt
a
kind
of
pity
for
the
angry
and
stranded
man
you
ca
do
anything
for
me
except
leave
me
alone
snapped
out
mortlake
you
cubs
are
altogether
too
inquisitive
you
too
nosy
but
not
to
the
extent
of
making
sketches
and
notes
mr
mortlake
inquired
peggy
sweetly
cattily
she
said
it
was
afterward
mortlake
started
and
paled
then
without
vouchsafing
a
reply
he
strode
off
in
the
direction
of
the
farm
house
to
get
the
water
he
needed
now
bradbury
said
roy
extending
a
hand
the
young
officer
leaped
nimbly
into
the
chassis
and
presently
a
buzzing
whir
told
that
the
faithful
was
taking
the
air
once
more
score
two
for
us
thought
peggy
to
herself
from
a
far
corner
of
the
pasture
mortlake
watched
his
young
rivals
climbing
the
sky
he
shook
his
fist
at
them
and
his
heavy
face
darkened
chapter
xi
the
marked
bill
some
two
days
after
the
events
narrated
in
our
last
chapter
lieut
bradbury
sitting
in
the
library
of
the
new
york
aero
club
on
west
street
received
a
telegram
from
eugene
mortlake
he
was
considerably
astonished
when
on
tearing
it
open
he
read
as
follows
must
see
you
at
once
have
positive
proof
that
young
prescott
is
about
to
sell
out
his
secrets
to
foreign
government
phew
whistled
the
young
officer
this
is
a
serious
charge
if
it
is
proved
it
will
bar
prescott
from
bidding
for
the
united
states
government
contract
but
i
can
hardly
believe
it
there
must
be
some
mistake
however
it
is
my
duty
to
investigate
let
see
three
i
can
get
a
train
to
sandy
beach
at
four
too
bad
too
bad
the
young
officer
shook
his
head
he
had
come
to
have
a
sincere
regard
for
roy
and
his
pretty
sister
as
well
as
admiration
for
their
resourcefulness
and
pluck
when
it
is
explained
that
during
the
time
elapsing
between
his
lucky
lift
in
the
prescott
machine
and
the
reception
of
the
note
that
lieut
bradbury
had
notified
roy
that
he
would
be
expected
to
report
at
the
brooklyn
navy
yard
his
feelings
on
learning
that
there
was
suspicion
directed
against
his
young
protegé
may
be
imagined
mortlake
too
had
received
a
notice
that
his
machines
were
eligible
for
a
test
so
that
there
would
have
seemed
to
be
no
object
for
his
acting
treacherously
otherwise
the
young
officer
might
have
been
suspicious
what
he
had
seen
of
mortlake
had
not
particularly
elevated
that
gentleman
in
his
opinion
but
if
he
had
desired
to
wrong
the
prescotts
reasoned
the
officer
such
a
resourceful
man
as
he
had
adjudged
mortlake
to
be
would
have
sought
a
deeper
and
more
subtle
way
of
going
about
it
and
i
have
staked
my
word
on
that
boy
loyalty
aye
and
on
his
sister
too
muttered
the
officer
as
he
made
ready
for
his
hasty
trip
to
long
island
by
this
it
will
be
seen
that
lieut
bradbury
was
by
no
means
proof
against
the
rather
common
failing
of
inclining
to
believe
the
first
evil
report
we
hear
it
is
a
phase
of
human
nature
that
is
not
combatted
as
it
should
be
in
the
meantime
roy
and
peggy
had
sustained
a
surprise
likewise
the
day
before
that
on
which
lieut
bradbury
received
the
disturbing
dispatch
an
automobile
had
whizzed
up
to
their
gate
and
stopped
roy
peggy
and
jess
and
jimsy
were
at
a
game
of
tennis
when
a
rather
imperious
voice
summoned
them
from
the
tonneau
of
the
machine
they
looked
up
to
see
a
remarkably
pretty
young
girl
who
could
scarcely
have
been
more
than
eighteen
years
old
her
eyes
were
black
as
sloes
and
flashed
like
smoldering
fires
a
great
mass
of
hair
of
the
same
color
was
piled
on
the
top
of
her
head
in
fashion
and
her
gown
of
a
magenta
hue
which
set
off
her
dark
beauty
to
perfection
was
cut
in
the
most
recent
too
recent
in
fact
style
can
you
direct
me
to
mortlake
aeroplane
factory
she
demanded
in
an
imperious
tone
evidently
the
flushed
young
people
who
had
been
playing
tennis
so
hard
were
very
despicable
in
her
eyes
there
it
is
down
the
road
there
volunteered
roy
it
that
place
the
appellation
was
unfortunate
the
girl
eyes
flashed
angrily
my
name
is
regina
mortlake
she
said
angrily
i
am
daughter
he
is
not
in
the
habit
of
putting
up
barns
i
can
assure
you
i
beg
your
pardon
began
roy
quite
taken
aback
by
the
extraordinary
energy
with
which
the
reproof
to
his
harmless
remark
had
been
given
but
the
beauty
in
the
automobile
had
given
a
quick
order
to
the
chauffeur
and
the
car
skimmed
on
down
the
road
later
that
day
the
ascended
for
a
flight
it
had
nothing
more
the
matter
with
it
on
the
day
of
the
than
the
heated
cylinders
which
as
mortlake
had
prophesied
soon
cooled
but
mortlake
himself
did
not
take
up
the
silvery
aeroplane
on
this
occasion
a
new
figure
was
at
the
wheel
clad
in
dainty
dark
aviation
togs
and
bonnet
with
a
fluttering
flowing
veil
of
the
same
color
which
streamed
out
like
a
flag
of
defiance
the
new
driver
was
miss
regina
mortlake
they
learned
later
that
the
girl
had
taken
frequent
flights
in
the
south
where
her
father
had
for
a
time
entered
into
the
business
of
giving
aeroplane
flights
for
money
at
county
fairs
and
the
like
his
daughter
had
taken
naturally
to
the
sport
and
was
an
accomplished
air
woman
she
knew
no
fear
and
her
imperious
ambitious
spirit
made
her
a
formidable
rival
even
to
the
foreign
flying
women
who
competed
at
various
international
aviation
meets
while
his
daughter
spun
through
the
air
eugene
mortlake
sat
in
his
little
office
in
one
corner
of
the
noisy
aeroplane
plant
four
finished
machines
were
now
ready
and
he
would
have
felt
capable
of
facing
any
tests
with
them
had
it
not
been
for
his
uneasy
fear
of
the
prescott
aeroplane
but
he
had
evolved
a
scheme
by
which
he
thought
he
would
succeed
in
putting
peggy
and
roy
out
of
the
race
altogether
it
was
in
the
making
that
afternoon
in
the
little
office
opposite
to
mortlake
sat
two
men
whom
we
have
seen
before
but
in
the
cheap
but
neat
suits
they
now
wore
and
with
their
faces
of
the
growth
of
stubby
beard
that
had
formerly
covered
them
it
would
have
been
somewhat
difficult
to
recognize
the
two
tramps
who
had
been
routed
by
peggy
in
such
a
plucky
manner
but
nevertheless
they
were
the
men
you
thoroughly
understand
your
instructions
now
questioned
mortlake
as
he
concluded
speaking
the
fellow
who
had
been
addressed
by
his
companion
as
joey
at
the
time
they
encountered
mortlake
and
harding
on
the
road
to
the
galloway
farm
nodded
we
understand
he
rasped
out
in
a
hoarse
voice
slim
here
and
me
do
take
long
ter
catch
on
eh
slim
no
dubious
manner
of
doubt
about
that
responded
slim
an
although
a
tramp
now
i
was
allers
one
i
held
my
head
as
high
as
the
rest
of
the
good
folks
of
the
world
i
can
play
the
gentleman
to
perfection
do
you
worry
this
slim
or
to
give
him
his
correct
name
frederick
palmer
was
as
he
declared
with
such
emphasis
a
man
who
had
indeed
seen
better
days
as
the
phrase
is
now
that
he
was
invested
in
clothes
and
was
graced
with
a
clean
collar
and
a
face
he
actually
might
have
passed
for
a
person
in
fairly
circumstances
for
the
part
mortlake
wished
him
to
play
he
could
not
have
picked
out
a
better
man
utterly
unscrupulous
and
with
the
best
of
his
life
behind
him
slim
as
the
tramp
fraternity
knew
him
was
prepared
to
do
anything
that
there
was
money
in
his
companion
possessed
no
such
saving
graces
of
appearance
short
coarse
and
utterly
lacking
in
every
element
of
refinement
joey
eccles
was
a
typical
hobo
but
mortlake
shrewd
mind
had
seen
where
he
could
make
use
of
him
too
in
the
diabolical
plan
he
was
concocting
and
the
details
of
which
he
had
just
finished
confiding
to
his
unsavory
lieutenants
but
say
struck
in
joey
eccles
his
little
eyes
agleam
with
cupidity
we
got
to
have
a
bit
more
of
the
brass
you
know
a
little
more
money
eh
he
ended
in
an
insinuating
whine
the
cringing
plea
of
the
professional
beggar
mortlake
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
i
gave
you
fellows
a
a
few
days
ago
he
said
in
addition
to
that
you
been
provided
with
clothes
and
lodging
what
more
do
you
want
we
got
to
have
some
more
coin
that
flat
announced
slim
decidedly
come
on
fork
over
you
gone
too
far
into
this
now
to
pull
out
mortlake
florid
face
went
white
as
if
he
heard
it
for
the
first
time
the
words
struck
home
he
had
indeed
gone
too
far
as
the
tramp
sitting
opposite
to
him
had
said
he
was
in
fact
completely
in
the
power
of
these
two
unscrupulous
mendicants
making
a
resolve
to
get
rid
of
them
as
speedily
as
possible
he
dived
into
his
breast
pocket
and
drew
from
it
a
roll
of
bills
that
made
slim
and
joey
eyes
stick
out
of
their
heads
he
peeled
off
a
and
flung
it
with
no
good
grace
down
upon
the
table
there
he
said
that
the
last
you
get
till
the
trick
is
done
thankee
i
knowed
you
see
sense
a
man
of
your
intelligous
intellect
and
that
will
do
snapped
mortlake
do
you
think
i
got
nothing
to
do
but
talk
to
you
fellows
all
day
you
thoroughly
understand
now
night
on
the
road
to
galloway
farm
yus
and
we
got
a
nice
little
deserted
farm
house
all
picked
out
where
we
can
keep
the
young
rooster
on
ice
grinned
joey
well
well
shot
out
mortlake
that
will
be
your
task
i
nothing
to
do
with
that
do
you
understand
he
rapped
the
table
nervously
i
know
nothing
about
it
all
right
all
right
we
wise
slim
assured
him
confidently
you
worry
come
on
joey
got
the
money
have
i
oh
no
i
goin
ter
leave
it
right
here
grinned
joey
enjoying
his
own
irony
hugely
still
chuckling
he
arose
and
shuffled
out
followed
by
the
unsavory
slim
outside
and
on
the
road
to
the
village
slim
began
to
be
obsessed
by
doubts
some
way
i
do
jes
trust
that
mortlake
he
said
you
sure
that
bill
is
all
right
joey
sure
well
you
jes
bet
i
am
here
look
at
it
yourself
all
right
ai
it
he
drew
out
the
bill
and
handed
it
to
slim
for
his
inspection
and
the
best
of
it
is
he
chuckled
while
slim
inspected
the
bill
carefully
the
best
of
it
is
that
i
was
conformin
to
the
exact
truth
when
i
told
mortlake
that
we
spent
all
the
other
coin
i
got
the
best
part
of
it
left
good
grunted
slim
turning
the
over
and
examining
the
reverse
side
that
being
the
case
hullo
what
up
asked
joey
for

slim
handed
the
bill
to
joey
pointing
with
a
grimy
first
finger
at
something
on
the
reverse

it
was
an
o
scrawled
in
dull
red

that
would
be
an
easy

uneasily

if

can

keep

chapter
xii
what
happened
to
roy
it
was
the
next
evening
mortlake
sitting
at
his
desk
looked
up
as
a
quick
step
sounded
outside
the
factory
was
in
darkness
as
the
men
had
gone
home
only
a
twilight
dimness
illuminated
the
little
glass
sanctum
of
the
inventor
and
constructor
of
the
mortlake
aeroplane
come
in
said
mortlake
as
the
next
instant
a
sharp
decisive
knock
sounded
lieut
bradbury
in
a
mufti
suit
of
gray
stepped
into
the
office
ah
good
evening
lieutenant
said
mortlake
rising
clumsily
to
his
feet
and
offering
a
chair
i
was
beginning
to
despair
of
you
bradbury
genuinely
worried
lost
no
time
in
plunging
into
the
object
of
the
interview
that
message
you
sent
me
what
does
it
mean
he
asked
i
can
scarcely
believe
nor
could
i
at
first
said
mortlake
with
assumed
sorrow
it
cut
me
pretty
deep
i
tell
you
to
think
that
a
boy
who
was
in
negotiations
with
his
own
government
for
a
valuable
implement
of
warfare
should
deal
with
a
foreign
government
at
the
same
time
in
brief
this
young
traitor
is
balancing
the
profits
and
will
sell
out
to
the
highest
bidder
that
strong
language
mortlake
said
the
young
officer
drumming
the
table
with
his
fingers
impatiently
honorable
and
upright
in
all
his
dealings
the
young
officer
had
no
liking
for
the
business
in
hand
yet
it
was
his
duty
to
see
the
thing
through
now
unpleasant
as
it
promised
to
be
strong
language
echoed
mortlake
yes
it
is
strong
language
but
not
a
bit
more
emphatic
than
the
case
warrants
did
you
know
that
for
some
days
past
a
german
spy
has
been
in
sandy
beach
no
certainly
not
well
there
has
been
he
visited
this
plant
with
proposals
to
turn
over
our
aeronautic
secrets
to
his
government
but
we
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
his
scheming
yes
very
good
go
on
please
the
young
officer
felt
that
mortlake
was
approaching
the
climax
of
his
story
one
of
our
men
resumed
mortlake
in
even
tones
in
which
he
cunningly
managed
to
mingle
a
note
of
regret
one
of
our
men
took
upon
himself
loyal
fellow
to
watch
this
spy
he
reported
to
me
some
days
ago
that
the
man
was
in
negotiation
with
young
prescott
good
heavens
i
know
it
sounds
incredible
but
we
are
dealing
with
facts
well
more
than
this
my
zealous
workman
ascertained
that
young
prescott
is
to
meet
this
foreign
agent
at
nine
on
a
lonely
road
and
is
there
to
hand
over
to
him
the
complete
plans
and
specifications
of
the
prescott
aeroplane
it
unbelievable
horrible
and
in
the
face
of
this
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
boy
would
dare
to
keep
up
his
apparent
negotiations
with
the
united
states
that
just
the
worst
part
of
it
as
i
understand
it
rejoined
mortlake
the
negotiations
with
this
foreigner
would
of
course
be
presumed
by
young
prescott
to
be
secret
this
being
so
he
would
if
successful
in
the
tests
sell
his
ideas
to
the
united
states
also
without
mentioning
the
fact
that
they
had
already
been
bought
and
paid
for
monstrous
just
what
i
said
when
i
heard
of
it
i
could
not
believe
it
in
fact
the
boy
has
always
seemed
to
be
all
that
was
upright
and
honest
it
just
shows
how
we
can
be
mistaken
in
a
person
i
can
not
credit
it
yet
mortlake
it
was
to
give
you
proof
positive
that
i
summoned
you
here
we
will
take
an
automobile
out
to
the
spot
where
young
prescott
is
to
meet
the
foreign
agent
of
course
our
arrival
will
be
so
calculated
as
to
give
us
time
to
secrete
ourselves
before
prescott
and
the
other
meet
are
you
willing
to
let
your
estimate
of
young
prescott
stand
or
fall
by
this
meeting
i
am
yes
replied
lieut
bradbury
breathing
heavily
the
young
scoundrel
if
he
is
caught
i
will
see
if
there
is
not
some
law
that
will
operate
to
take
care
of
his
case
mortlake
could
hardly
conceal
a
smile
his
plan
to
ruin
roy
was
working
to
perfection
in
his
imagination
he
saw
the
prescott
aeroplane
eliminated
as
a
naval
possibility
and
the
field
clear
for
the
selection
of
the
mortlake
machine
mentally
he
was
already
adding
up
the
millions
of
profit
that
would
accrue
to
him
lieut
bradbury
left
that
meeting
heavy
of
heart
mortlake
story
had
been
so
circumstantial
so
full
of
detail
that
it
hardly
left
room
for
doubt
and
then
too
he
had
offered
to
produce
positive
proof
to
allow
the
officer
to
witness
the
actual
transaction
good
heavens
is
there
any
good
in
the
world
thought
the
officer
as
the
hack
in
which
he
had
driven
out
to
the
mortlake
plant
drove
him
back
to
the
village
mortlake
had
agreed
to
call
for
him
at
the
little
hotel
at
eight
the
hours
till
then
seemed
to
have
leaden
feet
to
the
anxious
young
officer
it
was
shortly
before
this
that
roy
returning
from
an
errand
in
town
in
the
prescott
automobile
was
halted
at
the
roadside
by
a
figure
which
stepped
from
the
and
holding
up
a
cautioning
finger
uttered
a
sharp
hist
roy
turning
saw
a
man
seemingly
a
workingman
from
his
overalls
at
the
side
of
the
machine
what
is
it
what
do
you
want
demanded
roy
i
have
a
message
for
you
said
the
man
speaking
in
a
slightly
foreign
accent
you
are
in
great
danger
your
enemies
plot
it
my
enemies
exclaimed
roy
yes
your
enemies
at
the
mortlake
factory
let
see
said
roy
thoughtfully
you
one
of
the
workmen
at
the
mortlake
plant
are
you
i
once
said
the
man
with
a
vindictive
inflection
but
i
am
so
no
longer
mortlake
discharged
me
discharged
you
eh
well
what
that
got
to
do
with
me
roy
looked
curiously
at
the
man
just
this
much
i
know
the
meanness
that
mortlake
plans
to
do
to
you
you
have
bad
and
wicked
enemies
at
our
place
humph
i
guess
there
may
be
some
truth
in
that
said
roy
with
a
rather
grim
inflection
well
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
about
it
just
this
i
am
an
honest
man
i
do
not
want
to
see
harm
come
to
you
or
to
your
sister
this
was
touching
roy
in
a
tender
spot
to
my
sister
he
exclaimed
do
you
mean
to
say
that
mortlake
is
scoundrel
enough
to
plot
against
her
too
in
this
way
explained
the
man
he
means
to
destroy
your
aeroplane
leaving
the
field
clear
for
his
own
type
to
be
selected
by
the
navy
the
the
the
ruffian
panted
roy
now
thoroughly
aroused
tell
me
more
about
this
i
can
not
rejoined
the
workman
but
my
partner
he
was
discharged
too
he
can
tell
you
much
much
more
will
you
meet
him
i
can
take
you
to
him
roy
thought
a
moment
the
man
seemed
to
be
wholly
honest
and
in
earnest
how
far
from
here
is
the
place
where
your
partner
is
he
asked
oh
not
so
very
far
we
soon
get
there
in
your
fine
machine
will
you
go
well
i
yes
i
go
come
on
get
in
the
man
obeyed
the
invitation
with
alacrity
under
his
directions
roy
swung
the
car
off
upon
a
after
they
had
gone
some
few
hundred
yards
not
long
now
he
said
as
the
vehicle
bounced
and
jounced
over
the
ruts
and
stones
of
the
thoroughfare
this
is
a
funny
direction
for
your
partner
to
live
in
said
roy
at
length
there
are
not
many
dwellings
out
this
way
nothing
but
a
big
swamp
as
i
recollect
it
my
partner
he
poor
man
was
the
rejoinder
he
live
with
cousins
out
here
the
answer
lulled
roy
rousing
suspicions
it
must
be
all
right
he
thought
there
ca
be
any
trick
in
all
this
it
quite
likely
that
mortlake
does
want
to
play
us
a
mean
trick
i
forget
the
look
he
flashed
at
me
the
day
we
took
lieut
bradbury
away
from
him
in
that
meadow
after
we
had
made
our
first
sea
trip
wow
roy
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
the
recollection
they
chugged
along
in
silence
for
some
little
distance
farther
and
then
the
man
beside
him
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
roy
arm
almost
there
now
he
said
better
slow
up
roy
did
so
the
brakes
ground
down
with
a
jarring
rasp
at
the
same
moment
a
dark
figure
stepped
from
behind
a
tree
trunk
the
man
beside
roy
held
up
a
hand
this
is
the
young
gentleman
he
said
through
the
gloom
the
other
figure
now
approached
the
automobile
do
you
mind
getting
out
it
said
we
can
talk
better
in
the
house
where
is
the
house
i
do
see
one
said
roy
his
suspicions
rousing
a
little
it
just
behind
that
knoll
the
path
is
just
ahead
said
the
newcomer
roy
got
out
he
was
determined
to
see
the
adventure
through
now
if
mortlake
was
plotting
against
him
he
wanted
to
know
it
as
he
reached
the
ground
the
newcomer
extended
his
hand
as
if
offering
to
shake
roy
palm
roy
put
out
his
hand
which
was
instantly
grasped
by
the
other
your
friend
tells
me
that
you
have
something
interesting
to
tell
me
began
roy
i
here
what
are
you
trying
to
do
stop
it
the
other
had
seized
his
hand
in
a
clutch
of
steel
and
before
the
astonished
boy
could
offer
any
resistance
had
wrenched
it
over
in
such
a
manner
that
without
exactly
knowing
what
had
occurred
roy
found
himself
sprawling
on
his
back
the
lad
was
helpless
in
this
lonely
place
with
two
men
who
had
now
shown
themselves
in
their
true
and
sinister
character
chapter
xiii
plot
and
counterplot
the
spot
was
fearfully
lonely
roy
realized
this
to
the
full
brave
as
the
lad
was
he
felt
suddenly
chilled
and
creepy
besides
the
utter
mystery
that
enveloped
the
affair
was
gruelling
to
the
mind
now
be
still
pleaded
the
late
guide
as
roy
full
of
fight
jumped
to
his
feet
and
flung
off
the
detaining
hold
which
had
been
laid
on
him
yep
we
do
want
to
hurt
you
chimed
in
another
voice
the
voice
of
the
powerful
man
who
had
thrown
him
be
reasonable
and
quiet
now
and
you
come
to
no
harm
if
not
he
drew
a
pistol
and
presented
it
at
the
boy
head
the
hint
was
rough
but
effectual
roy
saw
that
it
would
be
mere
folly
to
attempt
resistance
what
the
meaning
of
this
rough
behavior
he
asked
in
a
steady
voice
mentally
resigning
himself
to
the
inevitable
you
just
come
with
us
for
a
little
while
said
the
one
do
worry
we
ai
goin
ter
harm
you
you
git
loose
agin
after
a
while
do
worry
about
that
this
assurance
though
mysterious
was
more
or
less
comforting
but
roy
resented
the
utter
mystery
of
the
affair
but
what
it
all
for
he
protested
is
mortlake
at
the
back
of
it
or
now
you
come
along
young
feller
said
a
gruff
voice
do
axe
no
questions
and
you
wo
git
told
no
lies
see
roy
saw
well
go
ahead
since
i
in
your
power
he
said
but
i
warn
you
it
will
go
hard
with
you
if
ever
i
am
able
to
set
justice
on
your
track
hard
words
break
no
bones
came
from
the
man
who
was
none
other
than
joey
eccles
disguised
with
a
big
beard
the
man
who
had
escorted
roy
into
the
trap
was
in
truth
a
former
workman
at
the
mortlake
factory
who
had
been
discharged
for
incompetency
he
had
applied
at
the
plant
to
be
taken
on
again
being
desperate
with
hunger
and
mortlake
had
assigned
him
to
the
present
task
for
which
if
the
truth
be
told
he
had
no
great
liking
where
do
you
want
me
to
go
was
roy
next
question
as
neither
of
his
captors
had
yet
made
a
move
we
show
you
fast
enough
young
said
joey
through
his
beard
come
on
this
way
he
caught
hold
of
roy
arm
and
began
piloting
him
along
a
path
or
rather
cow
track
that
ran
across
the
meadow
it
was
now
almost
dark
and
roy
after
they
had
gone
a
few
steps
was
only
able
to
make
out
the
dark
outlines
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
small
hut
on
the
edge
of
a
dense
woods
lying
directly
ahead
of
them
i
suppose
that
our
destination
thought
the
boy
well
they
have
not
attempted
any
violence
and
i
guess
if
they
had
meant
me
any
physical
harm
they
would
have
attacked
me
when
they
first
trapped
me
but
what
does
all
this
mean
that
the
question
nothing
more
was
said
as
the
three
the
captors
and
the
prisoner
tramped
across
the
dewy
grass
as
they
drew
closer
to
the
building
roy
had
descried
he
saw
that
it
was
a
dilapidated
looking
affair
shutters
hung
crazily
from
a
single
hinge
broken
looked
disconsolately
out
in
the
roof
was
a
yawning
gap
from
which
a
great
owl
flapped
as
they
drew
closer
evidently
the
place
had
not
been
occupied
as
a
dwelling
for
many
years
the
door
however
was
open
and
with
the
pistol
still
menacing
him
roy
was
marched
by
his
captors
into
the
moldy
smelling
place
handing
his
pistol
to
the
other
man
otherwise
joey
eccles
struck
a
match
carefully
screening
it
from
the
draughts
which
swept
through
the
rickety
building
he
led
the
way
into
a
bare
room
in
which
was
a
table
and
two
boxes
to
serve
as
seats
a
pack
of
greasy
cards
lay
on
the
showing
that
joey
had
been
passing
his
time
at
solitaire
this
fact
showed
roy
that
the
plot
had
been
carefully
concocted
and
that
the
trap
was
all
ready
to
be
sprung
much
earlier
in
the
day
only
a
brain
like
mortlake
he
reasoned
could
have
thought
out
such
an
intricate
plan
and
yet
what
could
be
mortlake
object
now
then
announced
joey
when
he
had
lighted
the
tin
kerosene
lamp
i
show
you
to
your
quarters
master
prescott
a
chill
ran
through
roy
at
the
words
what
could
be
coming
now
with
his
pistol
in
his
hand
joey
gently
urged
roy
into
a
rear
room
his
companion
following
with
the
lamp
once
in
the
room
joey
stepped
forward
and
stooping
down
raised
a
trap
door
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
a
rank
musty
smell
rushed
up
as
he
opened
it
thar
your
abode
for
the
next
three
or
four
hours
he
said
with
a
grin
to
roy
and
pointing
downward
the
boy
shuddered
not
in
there
he
said
them
our
orders
said
joey
shortly
there
a
ladder
there
now
you
can
climb
down
on
that
do
be
scared
it
only
a
cellar
and
guaranteed
when
the
time
comes
we
lower
the
ladder
to
you
again
an
git
you
out
roy
looked
desperately
about
him
unarmed
he
knew
that
he
did
not
stand
a
chance
against
his
burly
captives
but
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
one
of
them
had
a
pistol
he
would
have
even
then
attempted
to
make
a
break
for
liberty
but
as
it
was
hopeless
he
nodded
as
joey
pointed
downward
into
the
dark
rank
hole
and
with
an
inward
prayer
he
slowly
descended
the
ladder
the
instant
his
feet
touched
the
ground
joey
who
had
been
holding
the
lamp
above
the
trapdoor
ordered
his
companion
to
pull
up
the
ladder
the
next
moment
it
was
gone
and
the
trapdoor
was
slammed
to
with
an
ominous
crash
roy
was
enveloped
in
pitchy
darkness
suddenly
through
the
gloom
he
heard
a
sound
it
was
the
rasp
of
a
padlock
being
inserted
in
the
door
above
him
then
came
a
sharp
click
and
the
boy
knew
that
hope
of
escape
from
above
had
been
cut
off
if
the
men
kept
their
promise
they
would
release
him
in
their
own
good
time
and
that
was
all
he
had
to
buoy
him
up
in
that
black
pit
but
roy
as
those
who
have
followed
his
and
peggy
adventures
know
was
not
the
boy
to
weakly
give
way
to
despair
before
he
had
exhausted
every
possible
hope
and
not
even
then
but
in
the
darkness
he
did
bitterly
reproach
himself
for
falling
into
the
rascals
trap
so
blindly
well
of
all
the
prize
idiots
in
the
world
he
broke
forth
under
his
breath
in
the
blackness
commend
me
to
you
roy
prescott
if
thought
it
over
before
you
started
looked
before
you
leaped
this
would
never
have
happened
anybody
but
a
chump
could
have
seen
that
on
the
face
of
it
the
whole
thing
was
a
scheme
to
entice
you
away
oh
you
bonehead
you
ninny
the
boy
felt
better
after
this
outbreak
he
even
smiled
as
he
thought
how
neatly
he
had
walked
into
the
spider
web
then
he
shifted
his
position
and
prepared
to
think
but
as
he
moved
his
foot
struck
something
a
wallet
it
felt
like
he
reached
down
and
by
dint
of
feeling
about
managed
to
get
his
fingers
on
it
the
leather
was
still
warm
and
roy
realized
that
it
must
have
been
dropped
into
the
cellar
from
the
bearded
man
pocket
when
he
leaned
over
to
see
if
roy
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
queer
find
thought
the
boy
i
keep
it
maybe
there
something
in
it
that
may
result
in
bringing
those
rascals
to
justice
he
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
and
thought
no
more
of
it
his
mind
was
busy
on
other
things
just
then
if
only
he
had
a
match
he
felt
in
all
his
pockets
without
result
and
was
about
giving
up
in
despair
when
in
the
lining
of
his
coat
he
felt
several
lucifers
they
had
slipped
through
a
hole
in
his
pocket
gee
whiz
how
lucky
that
aunt
sally
forgot
to
mend
that
pocket
thought
the
boy
eagerly
thrusting
his
fingers
through
the
aperture
and
drawing
out
a
dozen
or
more
matches
these
may
stand
me
in
good
stead
now
but
i
do
want
to
waste
them
guess
i
just
light
one
to
see
what
kind
of
a
place
i
in
and
then
trust
to
the
sense
of
touch
if
i
see
any
means
of
escape
there
was
a
scratch
and
a
splutter
and
the
match
flared
bravely
its
yellow
rays
illumined
a
cellar
very
much
like
any
other
cellar
it
was
walled
with
stonework
well
cemented
and
there
were
two
or
three
small
windows
at
the
sides
but
these
which
at
first
filled
roy
with
a
flush
of
hope
proved
on
examination
to
have
been
bricked
up
and
solidly
too
nothing
doing
there
he
muttered
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
rear
of
the
underground
place
where
there
was
a
flight
of
steps
leading
up
to
a
horizontal
door
which
evidently
opened
on
the
outerworld
but
this
door
was
secured
on
the
under
side
by
a
rusty
padlock
of
formidable
dimensions
roy
tried
it
it
was
solid
as
the
rock
of
gibraltar
as
the
advertisements
say
stuck
he
muttered
disappointedly
and
yet
hold
on
what
about
that
pocket
tool
kit
i
had
when
i
started
out
on
the
auto
hooray
those
chaps
forgot
to
search
me
thought
it
was
too
much
trouble
i
guess
now
for
a
sharp
file
good
here
one
now
then
if
the
luck
holds
i
be
free
in
not
much
more
than
a
long
jiffy
these
thoughts
shot
through
roy
brain
as
he
selected
a
file
from
his
fortunate
find
and
began
working
away
at
the
hasp
of
the
padlock
above
him
he
could
hear
the
low
grumbling
growl
of
the
voices
of
his
guardians
but
they
came
very
faintly
lucky
thing
they
are
in
the
front
room
thought
roy
as
he
worked
on
otherwise
they
might
hear
this
at
last
the
file
had
cut
far
enough
into
the
hasp
for
roy
strong
fingers
to
be
able
to
bend
the
metal
apart
with
a
beating
heart
he
replaced
the
little
tool
in
its
case
and
pulled
the
ring
of
the
padlock
out
of
the
hasp
then
he
gave
an
upward
shove
but
very
gently
for
all
he
knew
the
door
he
was
pushing
upward
might
open
in
another
room
but
when
it
gaped
an
inch
only
roy
saw
the
faint
radiance
of
a
clouded
moon
a
gust
of
fresh
clean
air
blew
in
his
face
as
if
welcoming
him
from
his
noisome
depths
an
instant
later
with
throbbing
pulses
and
flushed
cheeks
roy
stood
out
in
the
open
above
him
light
clouds
raced
across
the
moon
alternately
obscuring
and
revealing
the
luminary
of
the
night
but
roy
did
linger
he
crept
across
the
field
keeping
close
to
a
tall
dark
till
he
reached
the
automobile
as
he
had
guessed
neither
of
his
captors
knew
how
to
run
it
and
it
stood
just
where
he
had
left
it
glory
be
thought
the
boy
climbing
in
i
all
right
now
i
know
where
this
road
goes
to
and
it
too
narrow
to
turn
round
but
keep
straight
on
and
i
bound
to
land
somewhere
he
turned
on
the
gasoline
and
set
the
spark
but
the
engine
did
move
queer
thought
roy
he
got
out
and
walked
round
to
the
front
and
then
the
rear
of
the
car
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
gasoline
there
stooping
down
he
found
the
ground
was
saturated
with
the
fuel
what
had
happened
was
plain
enough
the
cunning
rascals
who
had
captured
him
had
drained
the
tank
of
gasoline
the
auto
was
as
helpless
as
if
it
had
not
had
an
engine
in
it
at
all
well
this
is
a
fine
fix
thought
roy
however
there
nothing
for
it
now
but
to
keep
on
those
ruffians
are
cleverer
than
i
gave
them
credit
for
stealing
softly
toward
the
woods
the
boy
sped
into
their
dark
shadows
aided
by
the
flickering
light
of
the
moon
he
made
good
progress
through
the
gloomy
depths
he
did
not
dare
to
slacken
his
pace
till
he
had
traveled
at
least
half
a
mile
then
he
let
his
footsteps
lag
not
much
chance
of
their
discovering
me
now
even
if
they
have
awakened
to
the
fact
that
i
have
escaped
he
said
to
himself
as
he
strode
on
suddenly
he
emerged
on
a
strip
of
road
that
somehow
had
a
familiar
look
he
was
still
looking
about
when
a
strange
thing
happened
there
came
the
sound
of
rapid
footsteps
approaching
him
and
the
quick
breathing
of
an
almost
spent
runner
then
came
a
sound
as
if
somebody
was
scuffling
not
far
from
him
and
suddenly
a
voice
he
knew
well
rang
out
prescott
you
young
scoundrel
i
get
you
yet
the
voice
was
that
of
lieut
bradbury
well
how
under
the
sun
does
lieut
bradbury
know
that
i
here
marvelled
the
amazed
boy
stopping
short
at
the
same
instant
from
the
direction
in
which
the
naval
officer
shout
had
come
a
slender
dark
figure
came
racing
toward
him
chapter
xiv
how
they
worked
out
roy
made
a
desperate
clutch
at
the
figure
as
it
raced
past
evidently
fleeing
from
an
unseen
peril
that
that
peril
was
lieut
bradbury
roy
did
not
for
an
instant
doubt
as
he
could
hear
the
officer
shouts
in
his
undoubted
voice
close
at
hand
the
boy
hands
grasped
the
unknown
collar
but
at
the
same
instant
with
an
squirm
the
figure
dived
and
twisted
suddenly
it
bent
down
and
scooped
up
a
handful
of
sandy
gravel
and
flung
the
stuff
full
in
roy
face
blinded
the
boy
staggered
back
and
the
other
darted
off
like
a
deer
the
next
instant
two
heavy
hands
fell
on
roy
shoulders
and
he
felt
himself
twisted
violently
about
and
then
a
voice
lieut
voice
said
now
then
you
young
rascal
i
got
you
what
does
all
this
mean
that
just
what
i
like
to
know
exclaimed
roy
indignantly
brushing
the
gravel
out
of
his
smarting
eyes
i
been
made
prisoner
and
the
officer
astonished
voice
interrupted
him
what
do
you
mean
to
try
to
lie
out
of
it
did
you
just
hand
the
plans
of
the
aeroplane
over
to
that
representative
of
a
foreign
government
whom
mortlake
is
now
chasing
roy
looked
at
the
other
as
if
he
thought
he
had
gone
suddenly
mad
as
well
he
might
i
do
understand
you
he
gasped
what
is
all
this
a
joke
it
a
very
poor
one
if
it
is
i
give
you
a
chance
to
explain
said
the
officer
grimly
tightening
his
hold
on
roy
collar
as
things
stand
at
present
i
believe
you
to
be
as
black
a
young
traitor
as
ever
wore
shoe
leather
the
world
swam
before
roy
eyes
he
sensed
for
the
first
time
an
inkling
of
the
diabolical
web
that
had
been
spun
about
him
but
it
is
time
that
we
retraced
our
footsteps
a
little
and
return
to
events
which
occurred
after
the
lieutenant
had
been
picked
up
by
appointment
in
sandy
beach
in
the
automobile
which
called
for
him
were
seated
harding
whom
he
already
knew
slightly
from
meeting
him
at
the
aeroplane
plant
and
mortlake
himself
this
is
a
very
unfortunate
business
hey
croaked
old
harding
as
they
spun
along
the
road
to
the
place
where
mortlake
who
was
driving
declared
roy
had
made
an
appointment
to
meet
the
foreign
spy
it
is
worse
than
that
sir
it
is
deplorable
the
officer
had
said
and
he
meant
it
too
he
had
hardly
been
able
to
eat
his
dinner
for
thinking
over
the
extraordinary
situation
but
the
auto
sped
rapidly
on
now
it
had
passed
the
last
scattering
houses
outside
the
village
and
was
racing
along
a
lonely
country
road
finally
it
turned
off
and
entered
a
branch
thoroughfare
which
led
from
the
main
track
all
this
time
but
little
had
been
said
each
occupant
of
the
machine
was
busied
with
his
own
thoughts
and
in
the
lieutenant
case
at
any
rate
they
were
not
of
the
pleasantest
the
road
into
which
they
turned
was
little
more
than
a
track
with
a
high
ridge
in
the
centre
it
was
a
lonesome
spot
and
certainly
seemed
retired
enough
to
suit
any
plotters
who
might
wish
to
transact
their
business
unobserved
bother
such
sneaky
bits
of
work
thought
the
young
officer
to
himself
as
they
rushed
onward
through
the
darkness
i
feel
like
a
cheap
detective
or
somebody
equally
low
and
degraded
it
unmanly
and
oh
well
it
in
the
line
of
duty
i
suppose
or
hanged
if
i
would
have
anything
to
do
with
it
mortlake
showed
up
as
more
of
a
gentleman
in
the
matter
than
i
have
given
him
credit
for
he
seems
to
be
genuinely
cut
up
over
the
whole
nasty
mess
well
he
may
be
too
as
described
in
another
chapter
the
sky
was
overcast
with
hurrying
clouds
which
from
time
to
time
allowed
a
flood
of
moonlight
to
filter
through
by
one
of
these
temporary
periods
of
light
lieut
bradbury
was
able
to
perceive
that
they
were
in
a
sort
of
lane
with
high
hedges
on
each
side
suddenly
mortlake
ran
the
auto
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
at
one
side
of
the
road
and
drove
it
in
among
a
clump
of
alders
where
there
was
no
danger
of
it
being
seen
this
is
the
place
said
he
as
they
came
to
a
standstill
and
a
nice
lonely
sort
of
place
too
hey
chirped
old
harding
just
the
place
for
a
traitor
to
his
country
to
hush
said
the
young
officer
seriously
let
us
wait
and
see
if
young
prescott
completes
the
case
against
himself
before
we
condemn
him
mr
harding
humph
grunted
the
old
in
my
opinion
he
is
condemned
already
never
did
like
that
boy
something
sneaky
about
him
hey
hey
hey
the
officer
heart
was
too
sick
within
him
to
answer
he
drew
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
it
in
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
moonshine
it
was
almost
the
time
that
mortlake
had
declared
had
been
agreed
upon
for
the
consummation
of
the
plot
at
all
events
i
shall
know
within
a
few
minutes
if
this
story
is
to
be
credited
or
condemned
thought
lieut
bradbury
old
harding
and
mortlake
the
latter
leading
and
beckoning
to
lieut
bradbury
slipped
cautiously
through
the
alders
and
took
up
a
position
in
the
clump
at
the
edge
of
the
road
behind
a
big
bowlder
where
they
could
command
a
good
view
of
the
thoroughfare
without
being
seen
themselves
the
officer
with
a
keener
sense
than
ever
of
doing
something
dishonorable
joined
them
hark
exclaimed
mortlake
presently
but
although
they
all
strained
their
ears
they
could
hear
no
sound
except
the
cracking
of
a
tree
limb
as
it
rubbed
against
another
branch
in
the
night
wind
you
are
sure
this
was
the
place
asked
the
officer
so
my
man
told
me
rejoined
mortlake
you
know
i
relied
absolutely
on
his
word
for
this
thing
all
the
way
through
i
myself
know
nothing
of
it
he
emphasized
these
last
words
as
if
he
wished
them
to
stick
in
his
hearer
memory
suddenly
however
a
new
sound
struck
into
the
silence
it
was
a
heavy
footstep
gradually
drawing
closer
round
the
dark
corner
of
the
road
came
a
tall
form
in
a
long
coat
and
with
a
slouch
hat
pulled
down
well
over
its
eyes
lieutenant
bradbury
could
have
groaned
mortlake
nudged
him
triumphantly
well
he
said
i
guess
part
of
it
true
anyhow
i
afraid
so
breathed
the
officer
i
thought
so
hey
hey
i
thought
so
chuckled
old
harding
rustily
the
tall
figure
came
on
until
it
was
almost
opposite
the
bushes
where
the
three
hidden
onlookers
were
concealed
it
looked
about
in
some
impatience
tapping
one
of
its
feet
querulously
then
it
fell
to
pacing
up
and
down
evidently
the
boy
is
late
thought
the
lieutenant
and
then
a
glad
guess
shot
through
his
mind
perhaps
the
boy
has
thought
better
of
it
but
even
as
he
felt
a
great
sense
of
relief
at
this
supposition
there
came
a
low
whistle
from
farther
down
the
road
it
was
answered
by
the
figure
opposite
the
hidden
party
which
instantly
stopped
its
pacing
to
and
fro
by
the
great
north
star
it
true
gasped
the
officer
as
from
round
the
bend
in
the
road
below
where
they
were
stationed
a
slight
boyish
figure
walking
rapidly
came
into
view
it
hesitated
an
instant
and
then
perceiving
the
tall
man
it
came
on
again
have
you
got
der
plans
the
question
came
in
a
thick
guttural
foreign
tone
from
the
tall
figure
the
boy
who
had
just
appeared
showed
every
trace
of
agitation
he
struggling
with
his
better
nature
thought
lieut
bradbury
help
him
he
was
starting
forward
with
this
intention
when
mortlake
prepared
for
some
such
move
dragged
him
back
do
interfere
he
whispered
if
the
lad
is
a
traitor
as
well
know
it
now
as
at
some
future
time
lieut
bradbury
could
not
but
feel
that
this
was
true
he
sank
back
once
more
watching
intently
breathlessly
every
move
of
the
drama
going
on
under
his
eyes
with
a
quick
gesture
the
boy
seemed
to
cast
aside
his
doubts
he
muttered
something
in
a
low
voice
and
as
a
ray
of
moonlight
filtered
through
a
cloud
lieut
bradbury
distinctly
saw
him
pass
something
to
the
tall
man
goot
you
haf
done
vell
here
is
der
money
said
the
man
in
a
low
but
distinct
tone
that
carried
plainly
to
the
listeners
ears
he
held
out
an
envelope
which
the
boy
took
with
a
muttered
words
of
thanks
seemingly
lieut
bradbury
could
control
himself
no
longer
flinging
mortlake
aside
as
if
he
had
been
a
child
he
flashed
out
of
his
place
of
concealment
mad
rage
boiling
over
in
his
veins
what
he
had
just
seen
had
swept
every
doubt
aside
his
whole
being
was
bent
on
getting
hold
of
the
young
traitor
and
trouncing
him
within
an
inch
of
his
life
he
felt
he
would
be
fulfilling
a
sacred
duty
in
doing
so
but
as
he
sprang
forward
as
if
impelled
by
an
uncoiled
steel
spring
the
two
conspirators
caught
the
alarm
while
the
officer
was
still
rushing
through
the
bushes
they
dashed
off
one
in
one
direction
one
in
the
other
he
ruined
everything
groaned
mortlake
no
no
you
can
save
the
day
yet
if
you
act
quickly
cried
old
man
harding
in
the
same
low
intense
voice
shout
out
that
you
are
after
the
spy
right
cried
mortlake
clutching
at
a
straw
he
too
dashed
out
of
concealment
and
took
off
after
the
tall
man
bellowing
loudly
you
chase
the
boy
bradbury
i
get
the
spy
stop
you
villain
stop
it
was
at
that
moment
that
roy
just
emerging
from
the
woods
heard
lieut
bradbury
angry
challenge
prescott
you
young
scoundrel
i
get
you
yet
chapter
xv
what
mortlake
did
look
here
cried
roy
indignantly
wiggling
in
the
officer
strong
grasp
ca
you
see
that
this
is
all
a
mistake
if
you
had
grabbed
me
i
could
have
caught
that
impostor
a
great
light
seemed
to
break
on
lieut
bradbury
why
bless
my
soul
he
exclaimed
that
so
i
can
see
it
all
now
that
chap
who
got
away
wore
a
gray
suit
while
yours
is
a
blue
serge
is
it
it
was
before
i
was
thrown
into
that
cellar
said
roy
ruefully
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
now
and
he
saw
that
in
the
it
would
have
been
easy
to
mistake
his
blue
serge
as
it
was
for
one
of
gray
material
tell
me
exactly
what
has
happened
urged
the
officer
i
must
confess
i
am
in
a
mental
whirl
over
happenings
roy
rapidly
sketched
the
events
leading
up
to
his
capture
and
imprisonment
not
forgetting
to
lay
the
blame
on
himself
for
being
so
gullible
as
to
be
led
into
such
a
pitfall
not
a
word
more
of
my
boy
cried
the
young
officer
warmly
older
persons
than
you
would
have
stumbled
into
such
an
artfully
prepared
snare
baited
as
it
was
with
the
hope
of
catching
mortlake
in
a
plot
to
destroy
your
aeroplane
but
now
i
going
to
tell
you
my
experiences
and
we
can
see
if
they
dovetail
at
any
point
but
when
lieut
bradbury
concluded
his
narrative
they
were
still
at
sea
as
to
the
main
instigator
of
the
plot
of
course
the
finger
of
suspicion
pointed
pretty
plainly
to
mortlake
but
the
rascal
had
covered
his
tracks
so
cleverly
that
neither
roy
nor
the
young
officer
felt
prepared
to
actually
accuse
him
but
i
ca
see
how
an
ordinary
workman
would
have
had
either
the
brains
or
the
motive
to
direct
such
an
ingenious
scheme
to
discredit
me
in
your
eyes
concluded
roy
as
they
finished
discussing
this
phase
of
the
question
nor
i
but
hark
somebody
shouting
it
must
be
mortlake
yes
it
is
hull
o
a
hullo
a
came
back
out
of
the
night
come
we
will
retrace
our
steps
to
the
auto
and
meet
him
there
said
the
lieutenant
i
wonder
if
he
have
the
face
to
brazen
it
out
thought
roy
by
which
it
will
be
seen
that
his
mind
was
pretty
well
made
up
as
to
the
power
behind
the
night
work
could
come
near
the
fellow
puffed
mortlake
as
they
came
up
he
ran
like
a
deer
but
great
christmas
you
had
better
luck
i
see
for
an
instant
even
in
the
roy
saw
the
other
face
grow
white
as
ashes
he
thinks
that
lieut
bradbury
has
caught
my
impersonator
was
the
thought
that
flashed
through
the
boy
mind
but
the
same
sudden
radiance
that
had
betrayed
mortlake
agitation
also
showed
him
that
it
was
the
real
roy
prescott
he
was
facing
instantly
he
assumed
a
mask
of
the
greatest
apparent
astonishment
roy
prescott
i
am
really
amazed
that
you
should
be
implicated
in
such
a
save
your
breath
mortlake
snapped
out
the
lieutenant
and
his
words
came
sharp
as
the
crack
of
a
whip
this
is
the
real
roy
prescott
and
he
has
been
the
victim
of
as
foul
a
plot
to
blacken
an
honest
name
as
ever
came
to
my
knowledge
the
young
ruffian
who
impersonated
him
has
escaped
escaped
exclaimed
mortlake
but
to
roy
quick
ears
despite
the
other
attempt
to
disguise
his
relief
it
stood
out
boldly
yes
escaped
partly
owing
i
confess
to
my
overzealousness
there
has
been
foul
play
here
somewhere
mr
mortlake
the
officer
voice
was
stern
his
eye
flashed
ominously
just
then
old
harding
came
puffing
up
oh
so
you
got
the
boy
hey
he
cackled
but
mortlake
shut
him
off
with
a
quick
word
no
this
is
the
real
roy
prescott
it
seems
that
a
trick
has
been
put
up
on
us
all
the
lad
we
mistook
for
roy
prescott
was
some
one
impersonating
him
this
lad
has
been
the
victim
of
a
vile
plot
while
we
were
watching
here
for
his
supposed
appearance
and
the
revelation
of
his
treachery
some
rascals
had
locked
him
in
a
cellar
the
lieutenant
words
were
hot
and
angry
he
felt
that
he
was
facing
two
clever
rascals
whose
cunning
was
too
much
for
his
straightforward
methods
you
you
amaze
me
exclaimed
old
harding
looking
in
the
moonlight
like
some
hideous
old
ghoul
what
game
of
and
crooked
answers
is
this
that
remains
to
be
seen
i
shall
see
to
it
that
an
investigation
is
made
and
the
guilty
parties
punished
was
it
fancy
or
did
roy
for
a
second
see
mortlake
quail
and
whiten
but
if
the
boy
had
seen
such
a
thing
the
next
instant
mortlake
was
master
of
himself
it
seems
to
me
to
have
been
a
plot
put
up
by
my
workmen
he
said
if
i
find
it
to
be
so
i
shall
discharge
every
one
of
them
poor
fellows
in
their
mistaken
loyalty
to
me
perhaps
they
thought
that
they
were
doing
me
a
good
turn
by
trying
to
discredit
my
young
friend
i
am
proud
to
call
him
so
my
young
friend
prescott
for
the
first
time
roy
was
moved
to
speak
i
hardly
think
that
your
workmen
were
responsible
mortlake
he
said
slowly
and
distinctly
you
do
not
who
then
i
do
know
yet
but
i
shall
you
can
depend
upon
that
really
how
very
clever
we
are
smart
as
a
steel
trap
hey
grated
out
old
harding
rubbing
his
hands
smart
as
a
steel
trap
with
teeth
that
bite
and
hold
hey
hey
hey
instead
of
wasting
time
here
i
propose
that
we
at
once
go
to
the
house
in
which
roy
was
confined
and
see
if
we
can
catch
the
rascals
implicated
in
this
said
lieut
bradbury
can
you
guide
us
my
boy
i
think
so
sir
it
not
more
than
half
an
hour
tramp
from
here
said
roy
let
be
off
at
once
otherwise
they
may
escape
us
ridiculous
in
my
opinion
said
mortlake
decisively
depend
upon
it
those
ruffians
have
found
out
by
now
how
cleverly
the
boy
escaped
them
and
have
decamped
we
had
much
better
get
back
to
town
and
notify
the
police
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
differ
from
your
opinion
said
the
naval
officer
looking
at
the
other
sharply
of
course
if
you
do
want
to
go
oh
it
is
that
mortlake
hastened
to
say
i
willing
but
harding
he
is
old
and
the
night
air
harding
can
remain
with
the
automobile
there
are
plenty
of
wraps
in
it
come
roy
are
you
coming
mr
mortlake
yes
oh
yes
harding
you
will
make
yourself
comfortable
till
we
return
having
said
this
mortlake
came
lumbering
after
the
other
two
as
eagerly
as
if
his
whole
soul
was
bent
on
capturing
the
two
men
who
had
been
carrying
out
his
orders
i
got
a
revolver
ready
for
them
he
volunteered
as
the
party
plunged
through
the
woods
along
the
little
track
roy
had
followed
take
care
it
does
go
off
prematurely
and
alarm
them
said
the
officer
we
do
want
to
let
them
slip
through
our
fingers
of
course
not
i
be
very
careful
promised
mortlake
they
trudged
on
in
silence
suddenly
roy
halted
we
near
to
the
place
now
he
said
advance
cautiously
in
single
file
ordered
the
lieutenant
i
go
first
in
indian
file
they
crept
up
on
the
house
its
outlines
could
now
be
seen
and
in
one
window
a
ruddy
glow
from
the
lamp
the
two
abductors
of
roy
had
kindled
evidently
they
had
not
yet
discovered
his
escape
all
at
once
mortlake
who
was
last
stumbled
on
a
root
and
fell
forward
as
he
did
so
his
revolver
was
discharged
twice
the
shots
rang
out
loudly
in
the
still
night
instantly
the
light
was
extinguished
the
next
instant
two
dark
figures
could
be
seen
racing
from
the
house
before
lieut
bradbury
could
call
on
them
to
halt
they
vanished
in
the
darkness
and
a
patch
of
woods
to
the
north
what
a
misfortune
exclaimed
mortlake
contritely
picking
himself
up
lieutenant
bradbury
could
hardly
restrain
his
anger
how
on
earth
did
you
happen
to
do
that
mortlake
he
snapped
those
two
shots
alarmed
those
rascals
and
now
they
gone
for
good
it
most
annoying
i
appreciate
your
chagrin
my
dear
bradbury
rejoined
mortlake
suavely
but
accidents
will
happen
you
know
yes
and
sometimes
they
happen
most
opportunely
was
the
sharp
reply
mortlake
said
nothing
in
silence
they
approached
the
house
but
nothing
save
the
pack
of
greasy
cards
was
found
there
to
indicate
the
identity
of
its
late
occupants
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
return
to
the
automobile
they
found
old
harding
awaiting
them
eagerly
he
showed
no
emotion
on
learning
that
roy
captors
had
escaped
just
as
their
capture
seemed
certain
on
the
drive
back
to
sandy
beach
the
old
banker
and
mortlake
occupied
the
front
seat
while
roy
and
lieut
bradbury
sat
in
the
tonneau
as
they
skimmed
along
roy
drew
something
from
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
the
officer
it
was
an
object
that
glistened
in
the
wavering
moonlight
it
a
woman
hair
comb
cried
the
officer
in
amazement
as
he
regarded
it
hush
not
so
loud
warned
roy
i
picked
it
up
where
i
had
the
struggle
with
the
other
roy
prescott
it
may
prove
a
valuable
clue
chapter
xvi
missing
some
days
after
the
strange
and
exciting
events
just
recorded
peggy
burst
like
a
whirlwind
into
the
little
room
half
half
study
in
which
roy
was
hard
at
work
developing
a
problem
in
equilibrium
it
was
but
a
short
time
now
to
the
day
on
which
they
were
to
report
to
the
navy
board
of
aviation
at
hampton
roads
and
submit
their
aerial
craft
to
exhaustive
tests
both
brother
and
sister
had
occupied
their
time
in
working
like
literal
trojans
over
the
but
although
every
nut
bolt
and
tiniest
on
the
craft
was
in
perfect
order
roy
was
still
devoting
the
last
moments
to
developing
the
balancing
device
to
which
he
mainly
pinned
his
hopes
of
besting
the
other
craft
from
the
newspapers
they
had
been
made
aware
that
several
types
monoplanes
and
freak
designs
were
to
compete
and
roy
was
not
the
boy
to
let
lack
of
preparation
stand
in
the
way
of
success
detectives
and
the
local
police
had
been
set
to
work
on
the
mysterious
plot
whose
object
had
been
to
entrap
the
boy
but
no
result
had
come
of
their
work
incidentally
it
had
been
found
when
the
auto
which
roy
had
driven
to
the
deserted
house
was
towed
back
for
repairs
that
the
tank
had
been
punctured
by
some
sharp
instrument
as
for
the
clue
of
the
comb
peggy
on
examining
it
declared
it
to
be
one
of
a
pair
of
which
only
complicated
the
mystery
roy
had
thought
of
surrendering
this
clue
to
the
police
but
on
thinking
it
over
he
decided
not
to
he
had
an
idea
in
regard
to
that
comb
himself
and
so
had
peggy
but
it
seemed
too
wild
and
preposterous
a
theory
to
submit
to
the
intensely
practical
police
of
sandy
beach
roy
looked
up
from
the
desk
as
peggy
flung
breathlessly
into
his
sanctum
he
knew
that
only
unusual
news
would
have
led
her
to
interrupt
his
work
in
which
she
was
as
keenly
interested
as
he
was
what
is
it
sis
he
asked
you
look
as
excited
as
if
the
statue
of
liberty
had
paid
us
a
visit
and
was
now
doing
a
song
and
dance
on
the
front
lawn
oh
roy
do
be
serious
listen
who
do
you
suppose
has
come
back
to
sandy
beach
not
the
least
idea
who
fanning
harding
fan
harding
the
dickens
is
it
and
more
than
that
he
is
down
at
the
mortlake
plant
now
he
is
going
to
take
up
the
and
who
do
you
think
is
to
be
his
companion
give
it
up
regina
mortlake
phew
whistled
the
boy
a
new
conquest
for
the
irresistible
fanning
eh
do
be
stupid
reproved
peggy
severely
i
been
thinking
it
over
and
i
just
hit
on
the
solution
fanning
or
so
i
heard
took
up
aviation
when
he
was
in
the
west
you
know
he
always
had
a
hankering
for
it
yes
i
recollect
his
fake
aeroplane
that
scared
the
life
out
of
you
grinned
roy
well
pursued
peggy
not
deigning
to
notice
this
remark
i
guess
they
decided
that
mortlake
would
be
a
bit
er
er
overweight
is
it
called
so
they
sent
for
old
harding
son
to
manage
the
at
the
tests
jove
that
must
be
it
makes
it
rather
awkward
though
somehow
i
much
fancy
master
fanning
as
if
we
had
good
reason
to
despise
him
hark
there
goes
the
now
a
droning
buzz
was
borne
to
their
ears
running
to
the
window
they
saw
the
mortlake
aeroplane
whiz
by
at
a
fair
height
it
was
going
fast
and
a
male
figure
tall
and
slight
was
at
the
wheel
in
the
stern
seat
regina
mortlake
rubicund
aviation
costume
could
be
made
out
illustration
running
to
the
window
they
saw
the
mortlake
aeroplane
whiz
by
at
a
fair
height
fanning
has
certainly
turned
out
to
be
a
good
driver
of
aeroplanes
commented
roy
as
he
watched
see
that
flaw
strike
them
there
he
brought
the
through
it
like
an
old
general
of
the
upper
regions
peggy
had
to
admit
that
fanning
harding
did
seem
to
be
an
expert
at
his
work
but
she
did
it
regretfully
he
gives
me
the
creeps
she
volunteered
there
nothing
creepy
about
his
aeroplane
work
though
laughed
roy
i
should
have
believed
he
could
have
picked
up
so
much
in
such
a
short
time
but
a
bigger
surprise
lay
in
store
for
the
young
prescotts
that
afternoon
they
had
as
visitors
no
one
less
than
fanning
harding
and
regina
mortlake
while
peggy
and
the
daughter
of
the
designer
of
the
mortlake
aeroplane
chatted
in
one
corner
fanning
placed
his
arm
on
roy
shoulder
and
drew
him
out
upon
the
veranda
where
miss
prescott
sat
with
her
embroidery
i
know
you
do
like
me
roy
and
you
never
did
he
said
insinuatingly
but
i
changed
a
lot
since
i
was
in
sandy
beach
before
let
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
be
friends
again
more
especially
as
in
a
few
days
we
be
pitted
against
each
other
at
the
naval
tests
of
course
if
you
are
genuinely
sorry
for
all
the
harm
you
tried
to
do
us
i
nothing
more
to
say
said
roy
i
willing
to
be
friends
but
although
i
may
forgive
it
going
to
be
hard
to
forget
oh
that
will
come
in
time
said
fanning
airily
i
a
changed
fellow
since
i
went
west
but
in
spite
of
fanning
protestations
roy
could
not
help
feeling
a
sensation
of
mistrust
and
suspicion
toward
the
youth
there
was
something
unnatural
even
in
this
sudden
move
toward
friendship
it
ungenerous
ungentlemanly
roy
protested
to
himself
but
somehow
the
feeling
persisted
that
fanning
was
not
to
be
trusted
how
prettily
you
do
your
hair
peggy
was
remarking
to
regina
mortlake
in
the
meantime
she
looked
with
genuine
admiration
at
the
glossy
black
waves
which
the
other
had
drawn
back
over
her
ears
in
the
french
style
oh
do
you
like
it
asked
regina
eagerly
i
think
its
hideous
but
you
know
i
lost
one
of
my
combs
and
but
let
go
and
see
what
the
boys
are
doing
she
broke
off
suddenly
turning
crimson
and
hastening
to
the
porch
once
outside
she
plunged
at
once
into
conversation
with
the
two
boys
and
peggy
had
no
opportunity
of
picking
up
the
dropped
stitches
of
conversation
she
caught
herself
puzzling
over
it
why
had
regina
been
so
mortified
and
apparently
alarmed
when
she
had
announced
the
loss
of
one
of
her
right
there
a
strange
thought
came
into
peggy
mind
the
comb
that
roy
had
picked
up
could
it
be
that
but
no
the
idea
was
too
fantastic
in
the
pages
of
a
book
perhaps
but
not
in
real
life
and
yet
and
yet
peggy
as
she
watched
the
graceful
girl
talking
with
splendid
animation
found
herself
wondering
and
wondering
the
next
day
just
as
peggy
and
roy
were
starting
out
for
a
run
to
the
bancroft
place
fanning
harding
and
regina
mortlake
came
whizzing
up
to
the
gate
in
the
latter
big
touring
car
the
one
in
which
she
had
arrived
in
sandy
beach
the
machine
was
the
gift
of
her
father
it
was
a
commodious
car
with
a
roomy
tonneau
and
and
torpedo
body
of
the
latest
type
beside
it
the
blue
bird
looked
somewhat
small
and
insignificant
but
roy
and
peggy
felt
no
embarrassment
on
the
contrary
they
were
quite
certain
the
blue
bird
was
the
better
car
where
are
you
off
to
asked
fanning
in
friendly
tones
while
regina
bowed
and
smiled
very
sweetly
to
peggy
going
to
take
a
spin
in
the
direction
of
the
bancroft
said
roy
starting
his
car
what
fun
cried
regina
mortlake
so
are
we
let
race
i
do
believe
in
racing
rejoined
peggy
no
of
course
it
is
dangerous
said
fanning
i
guess
roy
is
a
bit
timid
with
that
old
car
too
besides
it
all
in
the
way
you
handle
a
machine
roy
flushed
angrily
i
guess
this
car
as
you
call
it
could
give
yours
a
tussle
if
it
comes
down
to
it
he
said
sharply
peggy
tugged
his
sleeve
she
saw
where
this
would
lead
too
she
saw
too
that
fanning
was
anxious
to
provoke
roy
into
a
race
presumably
he
was
anxious
to
humiliate
the
boy
in
regina
mortlake
eyes
well
do
you
want
to
race
then
asked
regina
provokingly
her
fine
eyes
flashing
there
a
bit
of
road
beyond
here
that
quite
broad
and
one
hardly
ever
meets
anything
now
roy
was
averse
as
are
most
boys
to
being
thought
a
cat
and
the
almost
openly
taunting
air
with
which
the
girl
looked
at
him
angered
him
almost
to
desperation
very
well
he
said
we
race
you
when
we
get
to
that
bit
of
road
oh
roy
what
are
you
saying
pleaded
peggy
it
all
a
trick
to
humiliate
us
the
blue
bird
ca
possibly
keep
up
with
their
car
and
but
roy
checked
her
impatiently
you
do
think
i
going
to
allow
fanning
harding
to
scare
me
out
of
anything
do
you
he
demanded
in
as
near
to
a
rough
tone
of
voice
as
he
had
ever
used
to
his
sister
poor
peggy
felt
the
stinging
tears
rise
but
she
said
nothing
the
next
moment
the
cars
began
to
glide
off
running
side
by
side
on
the
broad
country
road
faster
and
faster
they
went
the
speed
got
into
roy
head
he
began
to
let
the
blue
bird
out
and
then
fanning
harding
for
the
first
time
seemingly
realized
what
a
formidable
opponent
he
was
placed
in
contact
with
as
they
reached
the
bit
of
road
previously
agreed
upon
as
a
race
course
the
banker
son
stopped
his
machine
and
hailed
roy
to
do
the
same
tell
you
what
we
do
to
make
this
interesting
he
said
we
change
machines
or
are
you
afraid
to
drive
mine
i
drive
it
said
roy
recklessly
in
spite
of
peggy
quavered
say
no
good
that
will
give
us
a
fine
opportunity
to
compare
the
two
machines
cried
fanning
harding
he
jumped
from
the
bigger
car
and
handed
out
his
companion
then
for
the
fraction
of
a
minute
he
bent
monkey
wrench
in
hand
above
one
of
the
forward
wheels
a
bolt
had
worked
loose
he
explained
come
on
peggy
urged
roy
and
against
her
better
judgment
peggy
as
many
another
girl
has
done
before
her
obeyed
the
summons
although
an
intuition
warned
her
that
something
was
not
just
right
ready
cried
fanning
from
the
blue
bird
all
ready
hailed
back
roy
who
found
the
spark
and
throttle
adjustments
of
the
maroon
car
perfectly
simple
then
go
almost
screamed
regina
mortlake
peggy
was
looking
at
her
at
the
moment
and
she
was
almost
certain
she
saw
a
look
of
hatred
flash
across
the
girl
countenance
but
before
she
could
give
the
matter
any
more
thought
the
maroon
car
shot
forward
close
alongside
came
the
blue
bird
motor
hood
to
motor
hood
they
thundered
along
at
a
terrific
pace
the
road
shot
by
on
either
side
like
a
brown
and
green
blur
faster
peggy
heard
fanning
shout
somewhere
out
of
the
dust
cloud
it
was
wild
exciting
dangerous
roy
gasped
peggy
if
but
she
got
no
further
there
was
a
sudden
shock
the
front
of
the
car
seemed
to
plough
into
the
ground
a
rending
splitting
noise
filled
the
air
the
car
stopped
short
and
its
boy
and
girl
occupants
were
hurtled
like
projectiles
into
the
storm
center
of
disaster
chapter

jimsy
suspicions
are
roused
peggy
after
a
moment
in
which
the
entire
world
seemed
spinning
about
her
crazily
sat
up
she
had
landed
in
a
ditch
and
partially
against
a
clump
of
springy
bushes
which
had
broken
the
force
of
her
fall
in
fact
she
presently
realized
that
by
one
of
those
miraculous
happenings
that
no
one
can
explain
she
was
unhurt
the
automobile
its
hood
crushed
in
like
so
much
paper
had
skidded
into
the
same
ditch
in
which
peggy
lay
and
bumped
into
a
small
tree
which
it
had
snapped
clean
off
but
the
obstacle
had
stopped
it
one
wheel
lay
in
the
roadway
evidently
it
had
come
off
while
the
machine
was
at
top
speed
and
caused
the
crash
but
peggy
noted
all
these
things
automatically
she
was
looking
about
her
for
roy
from
a
clump
of
bushes
close
by
there
came
a
low
groan
of
pain
the
girl
sprang
erect
instantly
forgetting
her
own
bruises
and
shaken
nerves
in
this
sign
that
her
brother
was
in
pain
in
the
meantime
fanning
and
regina
mortlake
had
stopped
and
turned
the
blue
bird
they
came
back
to
the
scene
of
the
wreck
with
every
expression
of
concern
on
their
faces
roy
lay
white
and
still
in
the
midst
of
the
brush
into
which
he
had
been
hurled
there
was
a
great
cut
across
his
forehead
and
in
reply
to
anxious
inquiries
the
lad
who
was
conscious
said
that
he
thought
that
his
ankle
had
been
broken
peggy
touched
the
ankle
he
indicated
and
light
as
her
fingers
fell
upon
it
the
boy
uttered
an
anguished
moan
oh
gee
peg
he
cried
bravely
screwing
up
his
face
in
his
endeavor
not
to
make
an
outcry
that
hurts
like
blazes
poor
boy
breathed
peggy
tenderly
i
so
sorry
i
so
glad
you
not
hurt
sis
said
the
boy
i
do
matter
much
i
wish
you
could
stop
this
bleeding
above
my
eye
though
peggy
ripped
off
a
flounce
of
her
petticoat
and
formed
it
into
a
bandage
can
i
help
i
so
sorry
the
voice
was
fanning
harding
he
stood
behind
her
with
regina
at
his
side
oh
how
dreadful
exclaimed
the
girl
with
a
shudder
my
my
poor
car
and
my
poor
brother
snapped
out
peggy
indignantly
if
it
had
been
for
your
stupid
idea
of
racing
this
would
have
happened
i
just
knew
we
have
an
accident
it
too
bad
repeated
fanning
but
ca
i
do
something
yes
get
me
some
water
there
a
brook
a
little
way
down
this
road
you
find
a
tin
cup
under
the
rear
seat
in
our
machine
fanning
perhaps
glad
to
escape
peggy
righteous
anger
hastened
off
on
the
errand
regina
flounced
down
on
a
stone
by
the
roadside
and
moaned
oh
this
is
fearful
why
ca
we
get
a
doctor
oh
my
poor
car
it
will
never
be
the
same
again
nonsense
said
peggy
sharply
it
can
easily
be
repaired
but
you
think
i
worrying
about
your
car
now
do
you
i
do
know
i
sure
quavered
regina
i
know
it
all
terrible
is
your
brother
badly
hurt
no
fortunately
he
only
has
this
cut
in
his
head
and
a
broken
ankle
it
might
have
been
far
worse
regina
wandered
away
somehow
she
felt
that
peggy
had
taken
a
sudden
dislike
to
her
she
sauntered
toward
the
car
suddenly
she
stopped
and
her
large
eyes
grew
larger
in
the
middle
of
the
road
just
as
they
had
been
hurled
from
roy
pocket
lay
a
studded
with
brilliants
and
an
old
battered
wallet
oh
cried
the
girl
with
an
exclamation
that
was
half
a
sob
oh
what
good
fortune
so
he
was
keeping
that
as
evidence
against
me
eh
well
perhaps
this
accident
was
providential
after
all
she
picked
up
the
comb
and
then
turned
her
attention
to
the
wallet
giving
a
quick
glance
around
to
see
that
she
was
unobserved
the
girl
plunged
her
white
fingers
into
the
pocket
case
they
encountered
something
crisp
and
crackly
she
drew
the
object
out
a
bill
she
exclaimed
wonderingly
and
nothing
else
i
wonder
if
this
can
have
anything
to
do
with
she
was
turning
it
over
curiously
as
she
spoke
suddenly
a
red
spot
flamed
up
in
her
either
cheek
it
marked
with
a
red
round
o
she
exclaimed
what
a
bit
of
evidence
so
master
roy
prescott
you
were
planning
to
unmask
me
by
that
were
you
well
i
shall
play
the
same
trick
on
you
with
this
bill
fanning
harding
was
coming
back
at
that
moment
with
the
cup
full
of
water
the
girl
checked
him
with
an
excited
gesture
fortune
has
played
into
our
hands
she
cried
look
here
well
what
is
it
asked
fanning
rather
testily
this
bill
do
you
see
it
one
of
the
stolen
ones
look
at
the
red
circle
upon
the
back
jove
so
it
is
but
what
how
hush
do
talk
so
loud
this
wallet
which
contained
it
was
jolted
out
of
roy
prescott
pocket
when
he
was
hurled
from
the
machine
the
wallet
and
and
something
else
but
do
you
see
what
power
that
gives
us
no
i
confess
i
stupid
but
oh
how
dense
you
boys
are
exclaimed
regina
with
an
impatient
stamp
of
the
foot
do
you
see
that
this
bill
will
come
pretty
close
to
proving
roy
prescott
a
thief
if
we
want
to
use
it
that
way
you
are
a
witness
that
i
found
it
in
his
wallet
which
had
been
jerked
out
of
his
pocket
is
that
enough
well
men
have
been
sent
to
prison
on
less
evidence
said
fanning
with
a
shrug
but
i
got
to
hurry
up
with
this
water
or
they
suspect
something
i
talk
more
with
you
about
this
later
on
your
father
and
mine
need
every
bit
of
fighting
material
they
can
get
hold
of
if
we
are
to
win
the
big
prize
for
the
mortlake
aeroplane
a
shadow
fell
athwart
the
road
as
fanning
an
evil
smile
on
his
flabby
pale
face
hastened
down
into
the
depression
in
which
roy
with
peggy
bending
above
him
still
lay
the
girl
looked
swiftly
up
a
big
red
aeroplane
was
hovering
on
high
presently
one
of
its
occupants
a
girl
peered
over
the
edge
the
next
minute
she
turned
and
said
something
in
an
excited
tone
to
her
companion
the
aeroplane
began
to
drop
rapidly
in
a
few
seconds
it
came
to
earth
in
the
roadway
not
a
stone
throw
from
the
wrecked
auto
and
its
uninjured
blue
bird
comrade
the
new
arrivals
were
jimsy
and
jess
they
had
set
out
on
a
sky
cruise
to
the
prescott
home
and
jess
bright
eyes
had
espied
the
confusion
in
the
road
beneath
them
as
they
flew
over
the
swift
descent
had
been
the
result
hardly
noticing
regina
who
regarded
them
curiously
the
young
sky
sailors
hastened
toward
the
spot
in
which
from
on
high
they
had
seen
the
injured
boy
lying
a
warm
wave
of
gratitude
swept
over
peggy
as
she
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
saw
who
the
newcomers
were
in
an
emergency
like
the
present
one
she
could
not
wish
for
two
better
helpers
than
the
bancrofts
jess
and
jimsy
had
been
off
on
a
visit
and
so
had
not
been
made
aware
of
the
fact
that
fanning
had
returned
to
sandy
beach
their
astonishment
on
seeing
him
may
be
imagined
jess
regarded
him
with
a
tinge
of
disdain
but
the
frank
and
open
jimsy
grasped
the
outstretched
hand
which
the
son
of
the
sandy
beach
banker
extended
to
him
evidently
fanning
policy
was
one
of
conciliation
and
he
meant
to
press
it
to
the
uttermost
well
this
is
a
nice
fix
is
it
murmured
roy
smiling
pluckily
as
the
bancrofts
came
toward
him
with
pitying
looks
but
where
in
the
world
did
you
come
from
from
yonder
sky
grinned
jimsy
trying
not
very
successfully
to
assume
an
inanely
cheerful
tone
not
badly
hurt
old
man
are
you
no
just
this
wallop
over
my
eye
and
a
twisted
ankle
thought
it
was
broken
at
first
but
i
guess
it
is
how
did
it
all
happen
peggy
explained
jimsy
whistled
what
make
of
machine
is
your
car
fanning
he
asked
a
dashaway
was
the
rejoinder
the
same
type
as
ours
exclaimed
young
bancroft
they
are
the
best
and
stanchest
cars
on
the
market
i
ca
understand
how
such
an
accident
could
have
happened
unless
he
paused
and
then
went
on
resolutely
unless
the
car
had
been
tampered
with
what
an
idea
shrilled
regina
who
had
now
joined
the
group
you
surely
mean
to
insinuate
why
the
damage
done
to
my
poor
machine
will
cost
a
lot
to
repair
and
do
mind
if
i
have
a
look
at
it
do
you
asked
jimsy
in
his
most
careless
manner
i
interested
you
know
a
motor
bug
is
what
dad
calls
me
well
i
began
fanning
but
regina
interrupted
him
with
strange
eagerness
oh
by
no
means
look
at
it
all
you
wish
i
only
hope
you
can
find
some
explanation
for
this
regrettable
accident
i
hope
so
too
said
jimsy
gravely
but
in
the
meantime
let
make
roy
comfortable
in
the
blue
bird
then
if
we
can
fix
your
car
up
miss
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
struck
in
peggy
jimsy
this
is
miss
mortlake
fanning
you
know
miss
mortlake
these
are
our
particular
chums
jess
and
jimsy
bancroft
indeed
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
vouchsafed
regina
as
jimsy
and
fanning
lifted
roy
and
carried
him
to
the
blue
bird
and
made
him
comfortable
on
the
cushions
i
attend
to
the
other
car
volunteered
fanning
readily
but
jimsy
was
not
to
be
put
off
in
this
way
i
like
to
have
a
look
at
it
before
we
try
to
put
the
wheel
back
he
said
it
may
be
a
useful
bit
of
experience
all
right
assented
fanning
rather
sullenly
if
you
insist
but
i
think
we
ought
to
hurry
back
at
once
by
all
means
quoth
the
bland
jimsy
but
hullo
what
this
he
was
stooping
over
the
wheels
now
this
wheel
has
been
tampered
with
the
holding
cap
must
have
been
partially
unscrewed
look
here
he
held
up
the
brass
cap
which
was
supposed
to
keep
the
wheel
on
its
axle
some
of
the
threads
have
been
filed
out
of
this
he
said
positively
let
have
a
look
said
fanning
eagerly
he
leaned
over
and
scrutinized
the
part
which
jimsy
was
examining
those
threads
have
been
filed
he
said
they
worn
very
careless
not
to
have
noticed
that
it
surprising
that
it
held
on
so
long
it
might
have
held
for
a
year
if
the
car
was
run
at
average
speed
said
jimsy
slowly
but
the
minute
it
was
raced
beyond
its
normal
rate
the
weak
part
would
have
gone
what
do
you
mean
to
imply
blustered
fanning
though
his
face
was
pale
and
his
breath
came
quickly
i
do
imply
anything
said
jimsy
slowly
but
i
like
to
know
who
filed
this
cap
down
pshaw
you
are
dreaming
scoffed
fanning
a
dull
flush
overspread
jimsy
ordinarily
placid
face
after
a
while
i
wake
up
maybe
he
said
and
then
he
stopped
well
let
see
about
getting
roy
home
he
said
peggy
you
can
drive
the
blue
bird
and
fanning
and
miss
mortlake
can
sit
in
the
other
machine
as
soon
as
we
get
the
wheel
back
then
jess
and
i
will
go
ahead
in
the
dragon
and
break
the
news
to
miss
prescott
shortly
thereafter
the
two
autos
moved
slowly
off
while
the
aeroplane
raced
above
them
going
at
a
far
faster
speed
regina
turned
to
fanning
do
you
think
that
odious
boy
suspects
anything
she
asked
i
guess
he
does
but
he
ca
prove
a
thing
so
that
all
the
good
it
will
do
him
scoffed
fanning
and
besides
if
they
get
too
gay
we
got
a
marked
bill
that
will
make
it
very
unpleasant
for
a
certain
young
aviator

a

the

the
broken
ankle
which
both
peggy

had
dreaded
turned
out
to
be
only
a
sprain
affecting
the
same
unlucky
ankle
that
had
been
injured
on
the
desert
this
was
a
big
relief

the

were

roy
the

with

on
a

and
jess
and
jimsy
they
had
been
discussing
the
case
against
mortlake
and
fanning
harding
all
agreed
that
things
looked
as
black
against
them
as
could
be
but
where
was
the
proof
there
was
not
an
iota
of
evidence
against
them
that
would
hold
water
an

before
impartial
judges
it
positively

sighed
jess
to
know
that
people
have
done
mean
things
and
not
be
able
to
get
an
atom
of
proof
against
them
never
mind
said
peggy
all
well
that
ends
well
we
start
for
hampton
and
once
there
they
wo
have
a

to
try
any

to

said
decisively
those

have
got
to
bring
the
out
on
top
and
they
will
too
declared
jess
with
a
nod
of
her
dark
head
that
poky
old
harding
and
his

wo
have
a
word
to
say
when
they
are
over

not
it
does
do
to
be

confident

know

an

round
the

enthusiastic
friend
as
the
man
said
when
he
thought
he
lassoed
a
horse
but
found
he
roped
his
own
foot
instead
grinned
jimsy
but
say
what
all
this
coming
up
the
road
sure
enough
a
small
crowd
of
ten
or
a
dozen
persons
could
be
seen
approaching
the
prescott
house
they
were
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
mortlake
plant
in
advance
as
they
drew
nearer
could
be
seen
mortlake
himself
with
a
tall
man
by
his
side
and
fanning
harding
the
men
behind
seemed
to
be
workmen
from
the
plant
wonder
where
they
can
be
going
to
queried
jess
idly
for
a
few
moments
more
they
watched
the
advancing
throng
and
then
jimsy
cried
suddenly
why
that
sheriff
lawley
with
mortlake
and
there
si
hardscrabble
the
constable
right
behind
them
what
can
they
be
after
clues
laughed
peggy
but
the
laugh
faded
on
her
lips
as
she
exclaimed
why
why
they
coming
here
here
echoed
the
others
yes
that
what
they
are
confirmed
jimsy
as
the
procession
passed
inside
the
wicket
gate
and
came
up
the
gravelled
pathway
toward
the
house
sheriff
lawley
had
on
his
stiffest
professional
air
and
si
chest
was
puffed
out
like
a
pouter
pidgeon
on
it
glistened
like
a
newly
scoured
the
emblem
of
his
authority
an
immense
nickel
star
as
big
as
a
sunflower
roy
prescott
here
demanded
the
sheriff
in
a
high
official
tone
he
had
known
roy
since
he
was
a
boy
but
seemed
to
think
it
a
part
of
his
majestic
duties
to
appear
not
to
know
him
miss
prescott
i
that
is
er
this
is
a
very
unpleasant
business
i
hope
it
was
mortlake
stammering
he
mopped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
as
the
sheriff
interrupted
him
that
will
do
mortlake
leave
the
discharge
of
my
official
duties
to
me
please
that
right
by
heck
chorused
the
constable
approvingly
what
the
matter
sheriff
asked
roy
easily
as
yet
not
a
glint
of
the
truth
of
this
visit
had
dawned
upon
him
why
roy
it
about
that
thar
robbery
at
galloways
night
sputtered
the
sheriff
looking
rather
embarrassed
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
know
more
about
it
than
you
told
and
he
dived
into
a
pocket
and
drew
out
an
paper
an
i
got
a
warrant
fer
your
arrest
my
arrest
stammered
roy
why
you
must
be
mad
what
on
earth
do
i
know
about
it
nothin
only
you
happened
to
hev
a
marked
bill
in
your
pocket
day
shot
out
the
sheriff
triumphantly
fanning
harding
step
forward
what
do
you
know
about
this
only
this
that
miss
regina
mortlake
after
the
automobile
accident
found
a
wallet
belonging
to
roy
prescott
in
the
roadway
she
opened
it
and
discovered
that
it
contained
a
marked
bill
answering
the
description
of
one
of
the
bills
stolen
from
the
galloway
farm
house
she
made
me
a
witness
of
the
find
and
in
line
with
my
duty
as
a
citizen
i
thought
it
best
to
expose
the
thief
and
fanning
stopped
and
turned
pale
as
a
boyish
figure
sprang
toward
him
with
doubled
fists
he
shrank
back
turning
a
sickly
yellow
you
contemptible
sneak
shouted
jimsy
whose
fists
it
had
been
that
threatened
fanning
sheriff
i
claim
protection
said
the
cowardly
youth
shrinking
behind
the
official
now
no
fisticuffs
here
warned
the
sheriff
my
only
duty
now
is
to
preserve
order
and
arrest
roy
prescott
on
a
charge
of
grand
larceny
peggy
turned
white
and
sick
the
veranda
floor
seemed
to
heave
up
and
down
like
sea
waves
under
her
feet
but
in
the
next
few
seconds
she
regained
control
of
herself
why
such
a
charge
is
absurd
she
declared
vehemently
this
is
simply
spite
on
the
part
of
our
rivals
in
the
aeroplane
business
do
know
nuthin
about
that
reiterated
the
sheriff
stolidly
the
warrant
has
bin
sworn
out
an
it
my
duty
ter
execute
it
constable
arrest
that
boy
ef
his
foot
is
too
bad
hurt
to
walk
git
a
rig
an
drive
him
in
ter
town
hardscrabble
flushed
and
swollen
with
importance
stepped
forward
he
was
about
to
place
his
hand
on
roy
shoulder
but
the
boy
checked
him
no
need
for
that
peggy
if
you
have
them
get
out
the
auto
drive
into
town
at
once
mortlake
stepped
forward
prescott
he
said
i
hope
you
do
hold
this
against
me
i
i
do
wish
to
speak
to
you
sir
shot
out
roy
for
the
first
time
betraying
indignation
let
that
be
your
answer
but
i
really
i
sorry
to
bancroft
you
listen
but
jimsy
turned
his
back
on
the
flushed
overfed
man
whose
eyes
could
not
look
him
in
the
face
in
the
future
please
do
us
the
honor
not
to
speak
to
us
he
said
his
voice
vibrant
with
anger
why
if
i
may
ask
jimsy
flashed
round
because
if
you
do
pay
attention
to
my
request
i
afraid
i
shall
be
unable
to
curb
my
desire
to
land
both
my
fists
in
your
eyes
mortlake
drew
back
and
turned
away
among
his
workmen
he
did
not
speak
again
before
long
the
auto
came
round
in
the
meantime
peggy
had
taken
upon
herself
the
task
of
consoling
miss
prescott
poor
aunt
sallie
she
took
the
news
very
hardly
it
was
all
peggy
could
do
to
keep
her
from
rushing
out
upon
the
porch
and
denouncing
the
entire
assemblage
that
mortlake
she
cried
i
like
to
scratch
his
eyes
out
the
proceedings
in
sandy
beach
before
the
local
magistrate
ephraim
gray
were
brief
isaac
galloway
the
farmer
told
of
the
robbery
and
of
his
knowledge
that
the
marked
bill
was
among
the
money
he
followed
this
up
by
relating
the
fact
that
roy
had
been
in
the
house
in
the
afternoon
and
had
seen
the
safe
then
came
fanning
and
to
the
girl
astonishment
regina
mortlake
both
of
whom
swore
to
finding
the
marked
bill
in
the
wallet
in
the
road
do
you
deny
that
this
was
your
wallet
asked
the
magistrate
holding
up
the
leather
case
after
he
had
examined
the
marked
bill
i
do
declared
roy
in
a
firm
voice
what
you
did
not
drop
it
i
dropped
it
but
it
is
not
mine
was
the
stout
reply
then
what
was
it
doing
in
your
possession
do
i
have
to
answer
that
question
now
it
will
be
better
to
yes
well
then
i
found
it
in
the
cellar
of
a
house
to
which
i
was
lured
by
two
men
whom
i
am
confident
were
employed
by
this
hound
mortlake
be
careful
warned
the
magistrate
mortlake
is
a
respected
member
of
this
community
your
display
of
does
you
no
good
as
for
your
story
of
how
you
found
the
wallet
you
can
tell
that
to
a
jury
later
on
my
present
duty
is
to
hold
you
in
bonds
of
for
trial
a
deep
breath
like
a
sigh
went
through
the
courtroom
in
the
midst
of
it
an
active
upright
figure
stepped
forward
it
was
lieut
bradbury
who
had
arrived
in
the
courtroom
just
in
time
to
hear
the
concluding
words
but
he
had
already
been
informed
of
the
facts
for
the
story
was
on
every
tongue
in
the
village
i
am
prepared
to
offer
that
bail
he
said
but
peggy
had
been
before
him
with
her
mine
shares
she
had
a
good
bank
account
and
was
able
to
offer
cash
security
this
was
accepted
almost
before
the
young
officer
reached
the
judge
desk
peggy
thanked
the
lieutenant
with
a
look
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
of
course
said
the
magistrate
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
under
bonds
will
prohibit
his
leaving
the
state
that
is
understood
mortlake
nudged
fanning
harding
this
was
what
they
had
cunningly
calculated
on
with
roy
safely
bottled
up
in
new
york
state
it
would
be
manifestly
impossible
for
him
to
take
part
in
the
contests
at
hampton
in
virginia
while
they
conversed
in
low
eager
tones
peggy
and
lieutenant
bradbury
could
be
seen
talking
in
another
corner
court
had
been
adjourned
but
the
curious
crowd
still
lingered
jess
and
jimsy
stood
by
roy
fencing
off
the
inquisitive
villagers
and
sympathizers
the
whole
thing
had
taken
place
so
rapidly
that
they
all
felt
dazed
and
bewildered
suddenly
the
thought
of
what
his
detention
meant
dawned
upon
roy
we
be
out
of
the
race
for
the
naval
contracts
he
almost
moaned
it
was
the
first
sign
he
had
shown
of
giving
way
but
peggy
was
at
his
side
in
an
instant
no
we
wo
roy
she
exclaimed
her
eyes
brilliant
with
excitement
i
asked
lieutenant
bradbury
and
he
says
it
unusual
but
he
see
why
a
woman
should
be
barred
from
flying
in
the
contests
nothing
in
the
rules
about
it
anyway
oh
peg
gy
gasped
jess
you
would
do
anything
within
reason
to
balk
that
mortlake
crowd
in
their
trickery
and
deceit
declared
peggy
with
flashing
eyes
and
we
stand
by
you
announced
jimsy
stepping
forward
we
go
with
you
to
hampton
and
we
bring
home
the
bacon
the
inexcusable
slang
went
unreproved
jimsy
enthusiasm
was
contagious
thank
you
jimsy
said
peggy
winking
to
keep
back
the
tears
that
would
come
we
we
i
that
is
we
beat
them
out
yet
the
bunch
of
sneaks
and
it
my
opinion
that
mortlake
himself
knows
all
about
who
robbed
that
safe
cried
jimsy
not
taking
the
trouble
to
sink
his
voice
he
faced
defiantly
about
and
caught
mortlake
eye
it
was
instantly
averted
and
catching
fanning
by
the
arm
he
hastened
from
the
courtroom
i
wonder
what
mischief
those
young
cubs
are
hatching
up
now
he
said
as
the
two
hastened
off
bending
their
steps
toward
old
harding
bank
it
does
make
much
difference
chuckled
fanning
we
got
that
contract
nailed
down
and
delivered
now
chapter
xix
the
gathering
of
the
the
aeroplanes
a
dozen
in
all
that
had
been
selected
by
various
naval
sharps
from
all
over
the
widely
distributed
portions
of
the
country
for
the
weeding
out
of
the
best
type
were
quartered
in
a
broad
meadow
not
far
from
the
town
of
hampton
the
locality
had
been
chosen
as
removed
from
the
reach
of
the
ordinary
run
of
curiosity
seekers
who
had
flocked
from
all
parts
of
the
country
to
be
present
at
the
first
tests
of
aeroplanes
as
actual
naval
adjuncts
sheds
had
been
provided
for
the
accommodation
of
each
type
and
above
each
shed
was
the
name
of
the
aeroplane
it
housed
printed
in
small
letters
one
of
the
first
things
that
mortlake
and
fanning
harding
proceeded
to
do
on
their
arrival
at
this
bivouac
was
to
make
a
tour
of
the
row
of
sheds
in
search
of
the
prescott
machine
but
to
their
joy
apparently
no
shed
housed
it
there
were
machines
of
dozens
of
other
types
monoplanes
machines
of
the
helicopter
type
and
a
few
devices
based
on
the
parachute
principle
but
no
prescott
the
names
the
various
machines
bore
were
weird
the
the
the
the
the
the
and
some
titles
even
more
graced
the
sheds
so
that
it
was
small
wonder
that
in
this
maze
of
names
a
shed
at
the
far
end
of
the
row
bearing
the
obscure
title
of
nameless
missed
the
scrutiny
of
mortlake
and
his
aide
we
beaten
them
to
a
standstill
this
time
said
mortlake
with
intense
conviction
i
feel
that
the
has
the
contest
cinched
the
was
the
name
that
had
been
bestowed
on
the
machine
which
roy
had
poetically
dubbed
the
the
shed
of
the
mysterious
nameless
was
the
only
one
of
the
long
row
that
did
not
buzz
with
activity
all
that
day
which
was
one
assigned
to
preparation
for
the
contests
of
the
morrow
all
the
other
aeroplane
hives
fairly
radiated
activity
men
hovered
about
their
weird
helicopters
and
lovingly
polished
brass
and
tested
engines
the
reek
of
gasolene
and
burning
lubricants
hung
heavily
over
the
field
reporters
darted
here
and
there
followed
by
panting
photographers
bearing
elephantine
cameras
and
bulging
boxes
of
plates
for
the
metropolitan
press
was
playing
up
the
tests
which
were
expected
to
produce
a
definite
aerial
type
of
machine
for
the
united
states
navy
but
even
the
most
inquisitive
of
the
failed
to
get
anything
from
within
the
mysterious
realms
occupied
presumably
by
the
nameless
its
double
doors
remained
closed
and
no
sign
of
activity
appeared
about
it
this
was
conceded
on
all
sides
to
be
extraordinary
but
all
the
speculation
which
was
indulged
in
failed
to
elucidate
the
mystery
the
nameless
is
also
the
ungetatable
joked
one
reporter
as
he
and
a
companion
passed
by
but
if
anyone
had
been
about
late
that
night
long
after
the
aviators
who
had
quarters
at
the
hotels
in
town
had
quitted
the
field
he
would
have
seen
three
figures
two
girls
and
a
boy
steal
across
the
field
from
an
auto
which
had
driven
up
almost
noiselessly
and
unfasten
the
formidable
padlocks
on
the
doors
of
the
nameless
dwelling
place
this
done
they
vanished
within
the
shed
for
a
short
time
and
presently
thereafter
a
dark
and
strangely
shaped
form
slowly
emerged
from
the
shed
it
was
the
and
the
trio
of
young
folks
were
as
you
have
already
guessed
peggy
jess
and
jimsy
they
crawled
noiselessly
on
board
and
a
few
minutes
later
with
a
soft
whirring
of
the
propellers
the
shut
down
for
precaution
sake
to
half
speed
sped
almost
noiselessly
upward
the
night
was
a
calm
one
hardly
a
leaf
was
stirring
and
the
stars
shone
like
steel
points
in
a
cloudless
sky
the
aeroplane
after
it
had
attained
a
few
hundred
feet
seemed
to
merge
into
the
dark
background
of
night
sky
unless
one
had
known
of
its
flight
it
would
have
taken
a
sharp
pair
of
eyes
to
have
discerned
it
say
this
is
glorious
it
like
being
pirates
or
or
something
said
jimsy
enthusiastically
as
soon
as
they
had
reached
a
height
where
they
felt
they
could
talk
without
difficulty
it
great
after
being
penned
up
all
day
at
that
hotel
agreed
peggy
who
was
at
the
wheel
how
beautiful
the
stars
are
poor
roy
i
wonder
how
he
is
getting
along
you
know
he
was
doing
splendidly
when
we
left
and
he
has
our
telegrams
by
this
time
said
jess
oh
peggy
i
so
glad
that
the
board
of
naval
aviation
said
you
could
fly
the
oh
were
they
taken
aback
though
at
the
idea
chuckled
jimsy
i
thought
that
dignified
old
officer
would
fall
out
of
his
chair
at
the
idea
of
a
girl
daring
to
run
an
aeroplane
i
bet
if
there
been
anything
in
the
rules
about
it
peggy
they
have
barred
you
i
think
so
too
laughed
peggy
but
luckily
there
was
as
lieut
bradbury
pointed
out
it
was
a
case
of
an
emergency
it
is
as
if
tried
to
in
as
you
say
jimsy
well
i
sure
i
do
see
why
a
girl
should
run
an
aeroplane
just
as
well
as
a
boy
you
certainly
showed
that
you
could
peggy
when
you
raced
that
train
back
in
nevada
in
years
to
come
prophesied
peggy
i
dare
say
women
as
aviators
will
be
as
common
as
men
i
do
see
why
not
ten
years
ago
a
woman
who
ran
an
automobile
would
have
been
laughed
at
if
not
insulted
but
now
why
lots
of
women
run
their
own
cars
and
nobody
thinks
of
even
turning
his
head
hear
hear
cried
jimsy
i
declare
i
feel
like
a
lone
man
at
a
suffragette
meeting
then
conduct
yourself
as
if
you
were
actually
in
that
dangerous
position
laughed
peggy
the
girl
spirits
were
rising
now
under
the
excitement
of
the
night
ride
on
the
advice
of
lieut
bradbury
the
party
from
sandy
beach
had
kept
closely
to
their
rooms
at
the
hotel
all
that
day
it
was
at
the
advice
too
that
their
shed
had
been
labeled
the
nameless
if
mortlake
was
as
i
begin
to
think
concerned
in
these
attacks
on
you
the
officer
had
said
i
think
it
would
be
advisable
not
to
appear
any
more
than
necessary
let
him
think
that
you
are
out
of
the
race
accordingly
the
had
been
transported
secretly
and
placed
in
her
shed
at
night
the
secret
had
been
well
guarded
and
as
we
know
neither
mortlake
nor
fanning
harding
had
even
an
inkling
that
the
prescott
machine
was
far
very
far
from
being
out
of
the
race
on
and
on
through
the
night
throbbed
the
making
fast
time
at
last
they
decided
that
it
was
time
to
return
the
object
of
the
trip
to
see
that
all
was
in
running
order
had
been
accomplished
nothing
remained
to
do
now
but
to
wait
for
the
morrow
and
what
it
would
bring
forth
the
nature
of
the
tests
had
been
carefully
guarded
and
not
one
of
the
contestants
knew
anything
about
what
they
were
to
be
till
the
hour
came
at
which
they
would
be
announced
from
the
judges
boat
suddenly
as
they
neared
the
environs
of
hampton
and
the
glare
of
electric
lights
could
be
seen
on
the
sky
jimsy
gave
a
cry
and
pointed
down
below
they
were
flying
pretty
low
and
in
a
road
beneath
them
they
could
see
an
automobile
its
headlights
shone
brightly
but
it
had
stopped
all
at
once
a
sharp
shout
for
help
winged
upward
hullo
exclaimed
jimsy
somebody
in
trouble
down
there
maybe
better
descend
that
is
if
you
girls
are
scared
um
well
began
jess
but
peggy
interrupted
her
jess
bancroft
i
ashamed
of
you
it
our
duty
to
help
out
if
we
can
at
least
if
it
gets
too
hot
we
can
always
retreat
muttered
jimsy
under
the
covering
of
one
of
the
lockers
was
a
revolver
under
directions
jimsy
found
it
the
next
moment
they
were
descending
rapidly
with
hardly
more
noise
than
an
alighting
night
bird
they
dropped
into
the
lane
in
which
the
auto
was
stalled
as
they
touched
ground
the
sound
of
harsh
voices
caught
their
ears
shell
out
now
if
you
do
want
to
be
yes
come
on
hand
over
your
coin
or
it
be
the
worse
for
you
chimed
in
another
ruffianly
voice
good
gracious
gasped
jess
it
a
hold
up
but
now
another
voice
came
through
the
darkness
i
suppose
you
fellows
know
that
you
are
breaking
the
law
and
in
danger
of
imprisonment
if
you
are
caught
now
what
is
there
that
familiar
about
that
voice
puzzled
peggy
racking
her
brains
aw
do
preach
sermons
to
us
boss
came
one
of
the
gruff
voices
we
needs
the
money
and
we
ai
particular
how
we
gits
it
see
fork
over
now
or
the
sentence
was
never
completed
there
was
a
sudden
flash
and
a
sharp
report
the
man
in
the
automobile
had
defended
himself
apparently
for
there
came
the
sound
of
a
heavy
body
falling
and
then
his
voice
i
hope
i
have
hurt
you
badly
but
you
brought
it
on
yourself
as
your
companion
can
witness
the
next
instant
and
just
as
jimsy
sprang
forward
from
the
clump
of
brush
at
the
roadside
which
had
hitherto
concealed
the
aero
party
there
came
a
heavy
rush
of
feet
toward
them
a
dark
form
running
pantingly
appeared
jimsy
with
a
dexterous
outward
thrust
of
his
foot
tripped
the
fleeing
man
who
came
down
heavily
in
the
center
of
the
road
and
started
howling
for
mercy
in
the
meantime
the
occupant
of
the
automobile
had
climbed
down
and
detaching
one
of
the
lamps
examined
the
wounded
man
lying
in
the
road
beyond
jimsy
capture
as
the
rays
of
his
light
swung
to
and
fro
they
hovered
for
an
instant
on
peggy
white
strained
face
leaning
forward
above
jimsy
prisoner
upon
whose
neck
the
redoubtable
young
bancroft
was
now
sitting
miss
prescott
by
all
that
wonderful
came
an
amazed
voice
there
was
no
mistaking
that
bold
straightforward
voice
now
it
was
james
bell
the
mining
magnate
and
their
kind
friend
oh
bell
cried
peggy
half
hysterically
we
so
glad
come
chapter
xx
an
unexpected
meeting
as
bell
spoke
the
fellow
who
had
apparently
been
shot
leaped
to
his
feet
and
was
about
to
make
off
but
the
westerner
iron
hand
seized
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
brought
him
up
all
standing
simultaneously
jimsy
captive
gave
a
wrench
and
a
twist
and
would
have
escaped
but
for
peggy
the
girl
seized
a
small
nickled
wrench
out
of
the
in
the
dark
it
looked
not
unlike
a
pistol
you
stay
you
are
said
peggy
in
a
voice
which
though
rather
shaky
was
still
courageous
the
fellow
took
the
hint
and
just
then
bell
came
up
with
his
capture
who
had
merely
been
playing
possum
the
two
men
were
thoroughly
cowed
and
were
trembling
violently
do
be
hard
on
us
wailed
one
of
them
we
did
mean
no
harm
no
it
was
just
a
little
joke
protested
jimsy
prisoner
who
was
standing
in
the
rays
of
the
detached
auto
light
thoroughly
subdued
it
a
joke
that
liable
to
cost
you
dear
commented
bell
jimsy
he
added
for
by
this
time
recognition
and
greetings
had
passed
between
the
mining
magnate
and
jess
and
jimsy
jimsy
have
you
got
a
bit
of
rope
handy
my
boy
jimsy
rummaged
in
the
tool
and
supply
locker
and
presently
unearthed
a
coil
of
fine
cotton
cord
of
stout
texture
this
was
speedily
applied
to
the
hands
of
the
two
men
and
loose
thongs
placed
about
their
legs
while
this
work
was
going
forward
peggy
had
been
scrutinizing
the
faces
of
the
two
prisoners
with
a
startled
look
there
was
something
very
familiar
about
both
of
them
all
at
once
it
flashed
across
her
where
she
had
encountered
them
before
they
were
the
two
men
who
had
held
up
jess
and
herself
in
the
road
to
the
galloway
farm
that
eventful
afternoon
on
which
they
had
taken
refuge
from
the
storm
she
whispered
to
jess
her
suspicions
her
chum
instantly
confirmed
them
here
was
news
indeed
after
the
men
had
been
tied
and
placed
in
the
tonneau
of
bell
car
peggy
called
a
council
of
war
in
a
few
words
she
told
bell
of
all
that
had
happened
since
they
had
returned
to
the
east
and
narrated
the
part
the
two
prisoners
had
played
in
it
good
heavens
just
to
think
i
come
to
the
tame
and
effete
east
to
plunge
into
the
midst
of
such
an
exciting
laughed
bell
i
was
in
roanoke
seeing
about
the
shipment
of
some
supplies
when
i
saw
in
a
newspaper
that
the
contests
for
the
naval
contract
were
to
take
place
here
i
had
had
no
idea
from
your
letters
that
they
were
so
near
at
hand
as
i
had
some
time
to
spare
i
thought
i
run
over
to
hampton
in
my
machine
and
see
how
you
made
out
and
we
providentially
happened
to
fly
across
you
cried
jimsy
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
after
all
but
what
are
we
to
do
with
those
two
rascals
now
that
we
have
caught
them
wondered
peggy
if
we
take
them
into
hampton
and
turn
them
over
to
the
authorities
mortlake
will
know
of
it
and
may
make
more
trouble
i
wonder
if
they
know
much
about
him
and
his
schemes
i
recollect
now
that
i
seen
them
hanging
about
his
aeroplane
plant
i
could
call
to
mind
then
where
i
had
seen
them
before
but
i
suppose
the
shock
of
coming
upon
them
so
unexpectedly
jogged
my
memory
you
say
that
they
were
hanging
about
mortlake
place
asked
bell
in
an
interested
tone
yes
i
sure
of
it
repeated
peggy
i
certain
of
it
now
we
soon
find
out
said
bell
in
his
old
determined
manner
he
approached
the
car
in
which
the
two
bound
captives
were
still
huddled
now
you
fellows
he
said
in
stern
voice
you
know
better
than
i
do
most
likely
what
the
penalty
for
attempted
highway
robbery
is
in
the
state
of
virginia
oh
do
turn
us
over
to
the
police
wailed
one
of
the
men
none
other
in
fact
than
our
old
acquaintance
joey
eccles
his
companion
the
angular
and
lanky
slim
remained
silent
i
want
you
to
answer
my
questions
truthfully
snapped
out
the
westerner
after
that
i
see
what
i
do
with
you
now
then
do
you
know
a
man
named
mortlake
stammered
the
redoubtable
joey
good
you
came
here
with
him
well
what
if
we
did
growled
the
hitherto
silent
slim
paying
no
attention
to
him
bell
went
on
while
his
young
companions
pressed
eagerly
about
him
what
did
you
come
for
joey
seemed
about
to
speak
but
slim
growled
something
in
a
low
tone
to
him
and
he
was
silent
come
are
you
going
to
answer
demanded
bell
no
reply
very
well
i
drive
into
hampton
and
see
if
the
chief
of
police
get
more
out
of
you
the
mining
magnate
made
a
step
toward
the
car
as
if
he
were
about
to
carry
out
his
threat
this
was
too
much
for
joey
composure
we
came
here
with
mortlake
to
do
a
little
job
fer
him
he
sputtered
out
oh
you
did
eh
well
what
was
the
nature
of
that
employment
to
disable
one
of
them
flying
machines
which
one
one
that
belonged
to
the
prescott
kids
mortlake
said
he
make
it
worth
our
while
and
no
you
ca
stop
me
slim
and
then
when
we
find
the
machine
we
was
to
bust
up
he
turned
us
loose
without
a
cent
of
the
money
he
promised
us
we
was
broke
and
and
so
you
thought

your
pockets
by
holding
up
some
automobilist
or
traveller

reply
and
now
mister

i
going
to

on
a
trip
was
the
astonishing
reply
on
a
trip
stammered
joey
all
his
fears
lively
once
more
yes
on
a
trip
the
younger
members
of
this
strange
roadside
party
stepped
forward
as
they
advanced
into
the
glare
of
the
detached
headlight
joey
and
his
companions
saw
them
both
men
turned
away
and
seemed
much
embarrassed
what
are
you
going
to
do
mr
bell
asked
peggy
eagerly
the
mining
man
manner
had
become
almost
mysterious
my
dear
little
girl
said
james
bell
can
you
trust
me
why
of
course
came
in
a
chorus
well
then
you
let
me
work
this
thing
out
my
own
way
and
guarantee
that
things
will
be
straightened
out
for
everybody
are
you
willing
to
let
me
do
this
and
ask
no
questions
till
the
proper
time
yes
came
in
a
positive
chant
of
assent
very
well
then
you
fly
back
to
your
shed
i
continue
into
town
you
may
not
see
me
for
some
time
but
do
worry
i
got
this
job
in
hand
now
and
i
see
it
through
we
trust
you
absolutely
said
peggy
and
you
trust
us
to
the
last
ditch
said
the
westerner
vehemently
and
now
as
there
no
time
to
be
lost
we
go
our
respective
ways
by
the
way
what
time
does
the
first
test
come
off
we
do
know
yet
but
some
time
before
noon
it
is
rumored
that
it
will
be
an
easy
one
they
work
up
to
the
difficult
flights
by
degrees
volunteered
jimsy
good
i
like
to
have
all
the
time
possible
as
i
wish
to
do
what
i
have
to
do
thoroughly
with
this
bell
adjusted
the
headlight
he
had
removed
and
climbed
into
his
car
with
a
wave
and
shouted
farewell
he
was
off
gracious
i
feel
as
if
i
been
shaken
up
in
one
of
those
kaleidoscopes
or
whatever
you
call
them
gasped
jess
it
all
seems
like
part
of
a
dream
things
certainly
have
been
happening
quickly
agreed
peggy
but
i
feel
more
at
ease
now
than
for
a
long
time
bell
has
the
case
in
hand
and
he
see
it
through
and
fix
it
right
interposed
jimsy
enthusiastically
as
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
lingering
about
the
scene
of
their
strange
encounter
and
stranger
adventure
the
party
of
youthful
aviators
clambered
back
into
the
and
once
more
winged
aloft
it
was
a
short
dash
to
their
shed
and
they
reached
it
without
incident
then
with
hearts
that
felt
lighter
for
the
brisk
healthy
influence
of
breezy
james
bell
they
trudged
to
the
small
hotel
at
which
they
were
stopping
in
order
to
avoid
being
seen
by
mortlake
and
his
aides
till
the
last
moment
chapter
xxi
the
start
of
the
sky
cruise
the
first
flight
is
to
be
to
cape
charles
and
return
a
distance
of
sixty
miles
approximately
announced
jimsy
the
next
morning
he
held
in
his
hand
a
small
blue
folder
which
had
been
issued
to
all
the
contestants
it
contained
the
rules
and
regulations
governing
the
first
day
tests
a
hasty
breakfast
was
followed
by
a
quick
trip
to
the
grounds
in
one
of
the
ancient
hacks
that
seem
to
swarm
in
hampton
if
the
starting
field
had
been
a
scene
of
confusion
the
day
before
it
was
a
veritable
chaos
now
smoke
and
the
fumes
of
gasolene
hung
like
a
pall
above
it
through
the
bluish
cloud
could
be
seen
dim
figures
hurrying
with
cans
of
fuel
or
lubricant
bags
of
tools
and
engine
parts
reminds
me
of
circus
day
commented
jimsy
looking
about
him
hullo
there
the
out
already
he
exclaimed
presently
across
the
field
could
be
seen
the
silvery
wings
of
the
mortlake
aeroplane
several
figures
hovered
about
her
adjusting
stays
and
putting
finishing
touches
to
her
complicated
mechanism
presently
a
hush
settled
over
the
scene
and
the
party
of
naval
officers
detailed
to
superintend
the
start
and
take
the
times
of
the
competing
craft
came
through
the
crowd
they
were
directing
their
steps
to
an
unpainted
wooden
structure
at
one
end
of
the
field
this
building
was
equipped
with
various
instruments
for
recording
time
accurately
from
it
also
would
presently
be
given
out
the
wind
velocity
and
any
other
data
of
interest
to
the
aviators
the
party
in
full
uniform
swung
past
our
three
young
adventurers
lieutenant
bradbury
was
among
them
he
bowed
and
was
about
to
pass
on
when
he
stopped
and
fell
back
now
do
get
nervous
and
do
your
best
he
said
to
peggy
i
sure
that
we
shall
all
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
the
before
these
tests
are
over
i
hope
so
rejoined
peggy
we
shall
do
our
best
at
any
rate
i
know
you
will
and
now
if
you
excuse
me
i
must
be
hurrying
on
the
board
has
an
immense
amount
of
work
to
do
before
ten
the
official
starting
hour
the
trio
left
to
themselves
made
for
the
shed
which
bore
the
legend
nameless
above
its
door
many
curious
eyes
followed
them
as
they
paused
before
it
and
jimsy
inserted
a
key
in
the
stout
padlock
who
could
the
two
pretty
girls
in
natty
motor
bonnets
with
goggles
attached
the
plain
heavy
skirts
and
dark
be
speculation
ran
rife
there
was
a
regular
stampede
of
reporters
and
photographers
to
the
shed
of
the
nameless
but
when
they
arrived
there
to
their
chagrin
they
found
that
their
prospective
victims
had
slipped
inside
and
only
the
blank
doors
greeted
them
among
the
crowd
that
hastened
to
try
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
nameless
was
fanning
harding
whose
attention
had
been
attracted
by
the
rush
of
the
crowd
at
his
side
was
regina
mortlake
they
arrived
just
in
time
to
hear
somebody
say
it
two
pretty
girls
and
a
boy
they
just
kids
fanning
and
regina
exchanged
glances
the
girl
actually
turned
pale
they
are
here
after
all
she
exclaimed
and
i
thought
you
said
they
were
well
how
on
earth
was
i
to
know
that
they
had
hidden
their
machine
under
that
name
there
are
so
many
freak
craft
here
that
you
are
more
of
an
idiot
than
i
thought
you
said
the
girl
impatiently
all
our
work
has
gone
for
nothing
no
there
is
time
yet
if
only
eccles
and
that
other
chap
had
decamped
like
that
last
night
we
might
have
put
them
to
work
they
decamped
as
you
call
it
because
your
father
would
give
them
any
more
money
said
regina
with
flashing
eyes
that
was
inexcusable
folly
they
know
too
many
of
our
secrets
to
allow
them
to
wander
about
unwatched
oh
two
tramps
like
that
would
have
the
sense
to
make
any
use
of
what
they
know
rejoined
fanning
easily
besides
but
regina
mortlake
mind
was
busy
on
another
tack
is
it
against
the
rules
for
women
or
girls
to
drive
machines
in
this
contest
she
asked
say
fanning
eyes
glistened
i
guess
it
is
let
find
out
if
peggy
prescott
is
going
to
drive
that
machine
we
may
be
able
to
head
them
off
yet
the
two
conspirators
hastened
across
the
field
to
the
unpainted
wooden
shack
that
housed
the
committee
a
crowd
surged
about
it
asking
questions
and
demanding
impossible
things
it
was
some
time
before
fanning
elbowing
people
right
and
left
as
he
was
could
reach
the
front
he
scanned
a
printed
list
of
the
entries
for
the
contest
hung
on
the
wall
as
he
read
it
he
blamed
himself
bitterly
for
not
looking
at
it
the
day
before
near
the
bottom
was
the
name
nameless
entrant
miss
margaret
prescott
suddenly
the
disgruntled
youth
spied
lieut
bradbury
a
moment
he
cried
as
the
young
officer
turned
fanning
without
a
word
of
greeting
bellowed
out
ai
it
against
the
rules
for
a
girl
to
drive
an
aeroplane
in
this
contest
not
that
i
am
aware
of
rejoined
the
officer
he
reached
over
to
a
stack
of
pink
booklets
here
a
book
of
rules
read
it
hold
on
cried
fanning
as
the
officer
moved
off
i
want
to
make
a
protest
i
make
your
protest
in
writing
no
verbal
ones
will
be
considered
said
the
officer
briefly
but
see
here
i
no
time
to
talk
now
harding
good
morning
and
the
officer
passed
on
the
crowd
began
to
grin
and
soon
laughed
openly
this
enraged
fanning
the
more
he
angrily
shoved
his
way
to
the
outskirts
where
regina
was
awaiting
him
well
she
said
lifting
her
dark
eyebrows
well
echoed
fanning
in
a
surly
tone
it
no
go
no
go
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
there
is
anything
in
the
rules
apparently
to
prevent
a
woman
or
a
girl
driving
an
aeroplane
if
she
wants
to
come
and
let
see
my
father
suggested
the
girl
presently
he
want
to
know
about
this
it
may
mean
a
complete
change
of
our
plans
you
have
to
change
to
beat
the
muttered
fanning
if
only
those
drawings
had
been
lost
we
have
had
that
balancer
and
it
looks
to
me
as
if
we
might
need
it
before
we
get
to
cape
charles
why
the
wind
freshening
not
more
than
a
half
dozen
of
these
aeroplanes
will
venture
up
bother
the
luck
if
it
was
for
the
we
have
a
clean
sweep
this
is
only
the
first
day
counseled
regina
the
points
scored
will
not
count
for
so
very
much
there
plenty
of
time
humph
grumbled
fanning
and
as
this
conversation
had
brought
them
up
to
the
he
broke
it
off
to
communicate
his
intelligence
concerning
the
prescott
aeroplane
to
mortlake
who
heard
it
with
a
lowering
brow
bang
a
bomb
shot
upward
and
exploded
in
a
cloud
of
thick
yellow
smoke
in
the
signal
cried
jimsy
everything
ready
as
ready
as
it
ever
will
be
rejoined
peggy
nervously
fingering
a
stay
wire
the
navigators
of
the
nameless
were
still
inside
the
shed
the
doors
were
still
closed
peggy
had
decided
not
to
risk
having
the
machine
damaged
by
the
crowd
by
bringing
it
out
before
the
very
last
moment
as
the
bomb
sounded
jimsy
drew
out
his
watch
he
kept
it
in
his
hand
awaiting
the
elapse
of
the
preliminary
outside
as
fanning
had
prophesied
there
had
been
a
great
and
sweeping
reduction
in
the
number
of
aeroplanes
that
were
to
start
the
puffy
wind
had
scared
most
of
the
entrants
of
the
freak
types
and
only
five
of
the
more
conventional
kind
of
aircraft
were
on
the
starting
line
the
was
among
them
fanning
was
in
the
driver
seat
as
a
passenger
he
carried
regina
mortlake
she
looked
very
stunning
in
her
lurid
aviation
costume
and
her
handsome
face
was
as
calm
as
chiseled
marble
her
nervousness
only
displayed
itself
by
a
constant
tapping
of
her
gauntleted
fingers
fanning
finished
oiling
the
motor
and
adjusting
grease
cups
and
timers
and
straightening
up
glanced
nervously
about
him
still
no
sign
of
the
nameless
i
guess
they
got
scared
off
by
the
wind
he
grinned
to
mortlake
who
with
the
elder
harding
and
several
machinists
stood
by
the
side
of
the
i
doubt
it
rejoined
mortlake
it
would
take
more
than
that
to
alarm
those
girls
and
just
to
think
that
all
our
trouble
to
them
has
gone
for
nothing
you
did
a
bad
thing
when
you
let
eccles
and
that
other
chap
get
away
commented
fanning
i
do
like
their
disappearance
at
all
why
well
for
one
thing
they
know
a
good
deal
that
would
make
it
very
awkward
for
us
if
they
fell
into
the
hands
of
anyone
who
disliked
us
and
again
pshaw
you
are
alarming
yourself
over
nothing
they
were
well
paid
and
they
would
dare
to
make
trouble
if
they
told
about
us
they
implicate
themselves
just
the
same
i
do
feel
easy
hullo
there
goes
the
second
bomb
that
fellow
just
going
to
touch
it
off
and
at
the
same
instant
the
doors
of
the
nameless
shed
were
flung
open
from
them
emerged
the
glistening
form
of
the
half
a
dozen
men
whom
jimsy
had
hired
pushed
the
aerial
craft
rapidly
across
the
field
to
the
starting
line
so
engrossed
was
the
crowd
in
watching
the
other
machines
that
they
hardly
noticed
the
arrival
of
the
added
starter
but
not
so
mortlake
and
his
companions
they
watched
with
jaundiced
eyes
the
forthcoming
of
their
dreaded
rival
and
if
wishes
could
have
disabled
her
the
would
never
have
flown
on
that
day
the
echoes
of
the
second
bomb
rang
deafeningly
they
off
yelled
the
crowd
as
if
there
might
have
been
some
doubt
of
it
up
into
the
puffy
air
winged
six
aeroplanes
it
was
a
glorious
sight
from
the
chassis
of
the
various
air
craft
the
airmen
waved
farewells
to
the
cheering
crowd
flying
wing
and
wing
they
dashed
off
toward
where
the
sea
lay
a
deep
blue
patch
beyond
the
shore
presently
they
faded
into
dots
and
then
were
blotted
out
altogether
there
a
thick
haze
out
there
said
one
of
the
officers
as
the
aeroplanes
vanished
the
word
ran
through
the
crowd
and
created
a
momentary
sensation
then
the
big
throng
dismissed
the
flying
aeroplanes
from
its
mind
and
wandered
about
the
grounds
gazing
openmouthed
at
the
freak
types
whose
inventors
were
willing
enough
too
willing
to
explain
their
remarkable
points
it
might
be
a
long
time
before
the
first
of
the
homing
craft
would
come
in
sight
and
what
was
the
use
of
worrying
about
them
only
in
the
wooden
structure
housing
the
naval
officers
was
there
any
concern
displayed
if
it
thick
weather
said
lieutenant
bradbury
summing
up
a
discussion
they
going
to
have
some
trouble
on
their
hands
out
there
chapter
xxii
the
white
peril
what
that
no
not
that
schooner
below
there
i
mean
that
sort
of
whitish
drift
it
looks
like
cotton
on
the
horizon
jess
leaned
forward
and
addressed
jimsy
you
got
me
guessing
rejoined
that
slangy
young
person
ask
peggy
no
i
do
want
to
bother
her
now
she
got
her
hands
full
i
fancy
the
was
swinging
steadily
onward
above
a
sparkling
sea
the
slight
haze
perceptible
from
the
land
was
not
noticeable
to
the
air
voyagers
below
them
a
schooner
was
tacking
in
the
light
wind
closer
in
shore
lay
several
grim
looking
battleships
and
cruisers
in
their
leaden
colored
war
paint
they
looked
menacing
and
bulldoggish
far
off
a
mere
speck
could
be
seen
a
dim
and
indistinct
object
pointing
upward
from
the
cape
like
a
finger
they
guessed
it
was
the
light
for
which
they
were
aiming
peggy
last
glance
at
the
compass
had
confirmed
this
guess
jimsy
looked
about
him
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
and
slightly
ahead
was
the
the
silvery
aeroplane
was
rushing
through
the
atmosphere
at
a
great
rate
but
profiting
by
mortlake
experience
fanning
was
evidently
not
speeding
the
to
its
fullest
capacity
on
the
other
side
was
a
large
red
biplane
flying
steadily
and
keeping
about
level
with
the
far
behind
lagged
a
monoplane
the
other
contestants
had
dropped
out
of
the
race
they
were
so
manifestly
out
of
it
that
their
drivers
did
not
care
to
continue
a
glance
at
the
speedometer
showed
peggy
two
passengers
that
they
were
reeling
off
miles
an
hour
the
was
doing
slightly
better
we
should
round
the
light
in
a
few
minutes
now
said
jimsy
scrutinizing
his
watch
anxiously
will
they
report
us
asked
jess
yes
there
is
a
wireless
rigged
up
there
the
minute
we
round
it
on
our
return
trip
word
will
be
flashed
back
to
the
starting
point
silently
they
sat
counting
the
minutes
roll
by
all
at
once
jimsy
noticed
that
the
air
had
become
strangely
damp
and
moist
he
looked
up
he
could
not
refrain
a
cry
of
astonishment
as
he
did
so
the
was
enveloped
in
a
damp
steamy
sort
of
smother
the
had
been
blotted
out
and
so
had
the
other
aeroplanes
fog
he
exclaimed
what
a
bit
of
bad
luck
it
just
as
bad
for
the
others
peggy
reminded
him
have
you
got
your
course
asked
jess
anxiously
yes
almost
due
east
but
in
this
dense
mist
it
will
be
hard
to
come
close
enough
to
the
lighthouse
to
be
reported
without
the
danger
of
dashing
into
it
are
you
going
to
try
for
it
of
course
was
the
brief
reply
peggy
slowed
down
the
engine
the
now
seemed
to
be
gliding
silently
through
lonely
billows
of
white
sea
fog
it
was
an
uncanny
feeling
the
occupants
of
the
machine
felt
a
chilling
sense
of
complete
isolation
thanks
to
their
barograph
however
they
could
judge
their
height
above
the
sea
good
thing
we
got
it
commented
jimsy
otherwise
we
might
have
a
thrilling
encounter
with
the
topmasts
of
some
schooner
i
only
wish
we
had
some
instrument
to
show
us
where
the
other
aeroplanes
are
said
peggy
it
hard
to
hear
anything
in
this
fog
maybe
it
will
clear
off
suggested
jess
hopefully
not
unless
we
get
some
wind
opined
jimsy
queer
how
quick
that
wind
dropped
and
this
smother
came
up
nobody
even
hinted
at
the
deadly
danger
they
were
in
but
each
occupant
of
the
knew
it
full
well
except
for
the
compass
they
had
no
way
of
guiding
their
flight
and
to
turn
about
would
have
been
to
court
disaster
there
was
only
one
thing
for
it
to
keep
on
this
peggy
did
grimly
compressing
her
lips
hark
exclaimed
jimsy
suddenly
far
below
them
they
could
hear
a
mournful
sound
it
was
wafted
up
to
them
in
fits
and
starts
a
church
bell
cried
jess
we
must
be
over
land
peggy
the
other
shook
her
head
that
a
bell
buoy
i
guess
she
said
i
wish
he
tell
us
how
to
get
out
of
here
joked
jimsy
rather
wearily
who
asked
jess
that
bell
boy
never
had
one
of
jimsy
jokes
fallen
so
flat
he
mentally
resolved
not
to
attempt
another
one
presently
he
looked
at
his
watch
almost
eleven
he
said
we
must
have
passed
the
light
by
this
time
i
do
know
said
peggy
helplessly
if
only
the
chart
marked
that
bell
buoy
but
it
does
she
again
scrutinized
the
chart
pinned
before
her
on
the
sloping
slab
designed
for
such
purposes
but
no
bell
buoy
was
marked
on
it
as
being
located
anywhere
near
where
they
estimated
they
must
be
drifting
drifting
however
is
not
quite
the
correct
word
an
aeroplane
can
not
drift
its
life
depends
upon
its
motion
the
instant
it
stops
or
decreases
speed
beyond
a
certain
point
in
that
same
instant
it
must
fall
to
the
earth
this
fact
is
what
made
the
position
of
the
young
sky
cruisers
particularly
dangerous
although
the
gauge
showed
that
they
had
plenty
of
gasoline
the
supply
even
with
the
use
of
the
auxiliary
tanks
would
not
hold
out
indefinitely
if
the
fog
did
not
lift
or
they
did
not
land
sooner
or
later
they
must
face
disaster
worse
still
they
were
or
believed
they
were
navigating
above
the
sea
had
the
been
fitted
with
pontoons
like
some
of
the
glen
curtiss
machines
this
would
not
have
been
so
alarming
but
a
descent
into
the
ocean
would
inevitably
mean
a
speedy
death
by
drowning
suddenly
voices
struck
through
the
smother
all
about
them
they
seemed
to
come
from
below
it
thick
as
pea
soup
captain
aye
aye
i
be
glad
when
we
out
of
it
i
kin
tell
yer
this
bay
a
bad
place
ter
be
in
er
fog
a
ship
cried
jimsy
quick
peggy
he
almost
yelled
the
next
instant
set
your
rising
levers
the
girl
swiftly
manipulated
the
machinery
that
sent
the
on
an
upward
course
but
it
was
only
just
in
time
that
this
maneuver
was
carried
out
all
of
them
had
a
glimpse
for
an
instant
of
the
gilded
ball
on
the
head
of
the
vessel
beneath
them
for
an
instant
peggy
watchful
eye
had
been
deflected
from
the
height
gauge
and
she
had
allowed
the
to
drop
almost
on
the
top
of
some
coasting
vessel
mast
the
danger
over
they
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
whimsical
adventure
just
to
think
how
utterly
unconscious
those
fellows
were
of
the
fact
that
three
human
beings
were
hovering
right
above
them
and
listening
to
every
word
of
their
conversation
chuckled
jimsy
is
it
queer
a
little
while
later
a
steamer
whistle
boomed
through
the
fog
beneath
them
but
as
the
altitude
register
showed
five
hundred
feet
they
did
not
bother
about
it
at
all
events
we
know
we
still
above
the
water
and
not
in
danger
of
colliding
with
any
church
steeples
said
jess
and
she
found
consolation
in
the
thought
have
you
any
idea
at
all
as
to
the
direction
of
the
light
peggy
inquired
jimsy
at
length
i
i
really
do
know
confessed
peggy
with
a
gulp
mixed
up
it
so
thick
i
ca
tell
anything
and
i
deathly
afraid
of
running
into
the
lighthouse
by
mistake
then
for
goodness
sake
give
it
a
wide
berth
cried
jimsy
if
we
keep
on
cruising
about
for
a
while
we
be
bound
to
land
somewhere
anyhow
got
lots
of
gasoline
that
one
comfort
it
was
indeed
in
the
steady
hum
of
their
powerful
motor
the
young
aviators
found
consolation
in
that
lonely
ride
through
the
billowing
at
all
events
there
was
no
sign
of
a
falter
or
skip
there
if
only
we
could
get
some
wind
sighed
jess
might
as
well
wish
for
the
moon
said
jimsy
the
air
is
as
still
as
it
used
to
be
at
noon
out
on
the
desert
what
a
contrast
between
the
big
alkali
and
this
cried
jess
half
hysterically
the
strain
of
the
white
drifting
fog
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
her
jimsy
looked
at
her
sharply
look
here
sis
he
began
and
was
going
on
when
a
sharp
cry
from
peggy
arrested
him
at
the
same
instant
the
swerved
sharply
swinging
over
on
her
almost
right
in
front
of
them
for
one
dreadful
instant
there
loomed
the
outlines
of
another
aeroplane
the
next
instant
it
was
gone
but
the
picture
of
the
deadly
peril
its
outlines
exaggerated
by
the
mist
was
photographed
in
the
minds
of
every
one
of
them
we
must
land
somewhere
soon
said
peggy
in
rather
a
faint
voice
i
do
think
i
could
stand
many
shocks
like
that
another
inch
and
she
did
not
complete
the
sentence
her
two
listeners
did
not
require
her
to
it
did
not
take
a
vivid
imagination
to
have
pictured
the
result
of
that
other
inch
chapter
xxiii
out
of
the
clouds
ten
minutes
or
so
later
a
puff
of
wind
blew
the
folds
of
fog
apart
for
a
brief
instant
beneath
them
peggy
could
see
a
sandy
beach
and
some
brush
like
a
flash
she
took
advantage
of
the
momentarily
revealed
opportunity
the
under
her
guidance
sank
swiftly
grounding
a
few
seconds
later
into
a
bed
of
soft
sand
it
was
like
lighting
on
a
pillow
of
down
so
gently
had
the
glide
to
earth
been
made
shutting
off
the
engine
peggy
took
hold
of
jimsy
outstretched
arm
and
followed
by
jess
she
jumped
lightly
out
upon
the
sand
the
roar
of
the
surf
as
the
big
swells
rolled
upon
the
beach
was
in
their
ears
a
wholesome
stinging
tang
of
salt
in
their
nostrils
i
wonder
where
on
earth
we
landed
said
jimsy
looking
about
him
perhaps
this
is
some
enchanted
land
and
we
are
to
face
new
perils
dragons
or
something
well
gallant
knight
laughed
jess
in
the
highest
spirits
to
be
back
on
the
firm
ground
again
even
if
it
was
only
shifting
sand
we
trust
to
you
and
by
my
troth
exclaimed
the
mercurial
jimsy
ye
shall
not
be
disappointed
in
me
fair
damsels
hullo
an
adventure
already
hark
through
the
smother
a
dull
sound
was
borne
to
their
ears
a
sound
that
came
in
muffled
but
rhythmic
thumps
at
intervals
it
paused
but
then
was
resumed
again
somebody
chopping
wood
exclaimed
peggy
recognizing
the
sound
that
just
what
it
is
if
i
ever
wielded
an
axe
in
my
life
agreed
jimsy
now
logic
tells
us
that
an
axe
ca
work
itself
therefore
somebody
must
be
using
it
where
there
is
human
life
there
is
or
ought
to
be
food
how
about
it
girls
are
you
hungry
hungry
i
could
eat
anything
declared
jess
i
almost
as
bad
laughed
peggy
well
said
jimsy
as
there
is
no
sign
of
the
fog
lifting
yet
awhile
what
the
matter
with
our
starting
out
to
find
the
and
seeing
if
he
has
anything
to
eat
jimsy
you
a
genius
cried
jess
that
what
all
my
friends
tell
me
rejoined
the
modest
youth
they
set
off
over
rough
sand
dunes
overgrown
with
coarse
grass
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds
of
the
axe
the
sand
was
loose
and
their
feet
sank
ankle
deep
in
it
but
they
plodded
along
pluckily
all
at
once
just
as
if
a
curtain
had
been
drawn
the
outlines
of
a
rough
shanty
appeared
in
front
of
them
it
was
a
sort
of
a
place
seemingly
made
of
driftwood
and
old
sacks
and
bits
of
canvas
from
a
rusty
iron
on
top
a
feeble
column
of
blue
smoke
was
ascending
the
noise
of
chopping
had
ceased
on
their
approach
and
as
they
stood
hesitating
a
strange
figure
suddenly
appeared
round
the
corner
of
the
wretched
rookery
of
a
place
the
man
who
stood
facing
them
a
startled
look
in
his
light
blue
eyes
was
apparently
about
middle
age
he
wore
a
full
beard
of
a
golden
brown
color
and
was
barefooted
and
hatless
his
clothes
consisted
of
a
tattered
shirt
and
a
pair
of
coarse
canvas
trousers
well
shiver
my
toplights
he
cried
as
his
eyes
fell
on
the
trio
whar
under
ther
sun
did
you
come
from
drop
from
ther
clouds
that
just
what
we
did
said
the
debonnaire
jimsy
as
the
girls
drew
back
rather
affrighted
at
the
weird
looking
figure
and
his
queer
wild
way
of
talking
what
that
do
try
to
fool
with
me
young
feller
i
ai
as
crazy
as
i
reckon
i
looks
there
was
a
certain
dignity
about
the
man
when
he
spoke
that
despite
his
ragged
clothing
and
miserable
habitation
was
impressive
no
it
really
so
jimsy
hastened
to
assure
him
we
we
came
in
an
aeroplane
you
know
well
now
said
the
man
scratching
his
head
i
reckon
that
the
first
of
them
contrivances
to
reach
lost
brig
island
lost
brig
island
echoed
jess
in
an
alarmed
tone
is
this
an
island
if
the
geography
books
still
define
an
island
as
a
body
of
land
surrounded
by
water
it
is
rejoined
the
man
with
a
smile
are
we
far
from
cape
charles
asked
peggy
eagerly
why
no
not
more
than
six
miles
to
the
north
but
what
under
ther
sun
air
you
young
folks
in
your
fine
clothes
out
here
peggy
hastily
explained
and
the
man
said
that
he
had
seen
some
reference
to
the
coming
contests
in
a
stray
paper
the
had
given
him
the
last
time
he
passed
the
lighthouse
in
a
small
boat
he
kept
is
the
island
inhabited
inquired
jimsy
we
like
to
get
something
to
eat
if
there
a
hotel
or
the
man
of
the
island
burst
into
a
laugh
not
a
rough
guffaw
but
a
laugh
of
genuine
amusement
i
guess
i
the
only
hotel
keeper
on
the
island
he
said
and
my
guests
is
sea
gulls
and
once
in
a
while
a
turtle
but
if
you
do
mind
eating
some
fish
and
potatoes
you
welcome
to
what
i
have
i
sure
that
awfully
good
of
you
said
peggy
warmly
and
we
love
fish
well
come
on
in
and
sit
down
this
fog
wo
last
forever
i
was
chopping
wood
to
get
dinner
when
i
heard
you
coming
over
the
sands
i
do
often
have
visitors
so
you
have
to
rough
it
so
saying
the
strange
lone
island
dweller
led
them
into
his
hut
it
was
rough
inside
but
scrupulously
clean
some
attempts
had
been
made
to
beautify
it
by
hanging
up
on
the
walls
shells
and
curiosities
of
the
beach
here
and
there
too
were
panels
of
rare
woods
which
the
explained
had
come
from
the
cabins
of
wrecked
ships
a
big
cat
his
only
companion
lay
beside
the
fire
and
blinked
at
the
visitors
as
if
they
were
an
everyday
occurrence
chairs
fashioned
out
of
barrels
and
boxes
stood
about
some
of
them
cushioned
after
a
fashion
with
sacking
stuffed
with
dried
sea
weed
sit
down
said
their
host
hospitably
ai
much
to
boast
of
in
the
way
of
furniture
but
it
the
best
i
can
do
ca
expect
to
find
a
waldorf
hotel
on
lost
brig
island
you
have
been
in
new
york
then
exclaimed
peggy
struck
by
the
reference
the
man
face
underwent
a
transformation
once
many
years
ago
he
said
but
i
never
like
to
talk
about
it
why
not
blundered
the
tactless
jimsy
because
a
wrong
a
very
great
wrong
was
done
to
me
there
said
the
man
slowly
without
another
word
he
rose
and
left
the
hut
none
of
the
visitors
dared
to
speak
to
him
so
black
had
his
face
grown
at
the
recollections
called
up
by
peggy
unlucky
remark
after
an
absence
of
some
moments
he
came
back
he
carried
a
string
of
cleaned
fish
in
one
hand
and
a
tin
measure
of
potatoes
in
the
other
in
the
interval
that
had
elapsed
he
seemed
to
have
recovered
his
equanimity
well
here
dinner
he
announced
in
a
cheery
voice
it
ai
much
to
boast
of
but
hunger
the
best
sauce
sitting
on
an
upturned
box
he
started
to
peel
potatoes
and
presently
put
them
on
the
fire
in
a
rough
iron
pot
when
they
were
almost
done
a
fact
which
he
ascertained
by
prodding
them
with
a
clean
sliver
of
wood
he
set
the
fish
in
a
frying
pan
or
spider
and
the
appetizing
aroma
of
the
meal
presently
filled
the
lowly
hut
on
a
table
formed
of
big
planks
once
the
hull
of
some
wrecked
schooner
laid
on
rough
trestles
they
ate
what
peggy
afterward
declared
was
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
dinners
of
her
life
their
host
had
at
one
time
of
his
life
been
a
sailor
it
would
seem
at
any
rate
he
had
a
fund
of
anecdote
of
the
sea
and
its
perils
that
held
them
enthralled
every
now
and
again
through
the
open
door
peggy
cast
a
glance
outside
but
the
fog
still
hung
thick
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
their
meal
footsteps
sounded
and
voices
came
to
their
ears
hullo
more
visitors
exclaimed
the
man
of
the
island
starting
to
his
feet
this
is
a
day
of
events
with
a
vengeance
who
can
be
coming
now
the
footsteps
had
drawn
close
now
and
a
voice
could
be
heard
saying
what
a
rickety
old
place
i
wonder
what
kind
of
savage
lives
here
fanning
harding
gasped
peggy
as
another
voice
struck
in
a
voice
she
instantly
knew
as
regina
mortlake
illustration
the
next
minute
the
man
of
the
island
ushered
in
his
two
new
guests
oh
what
a
dreadful
place
why
wo
this
miserable
fog
lift
i
be
dead
before
we
get
back
to
the
hotel
the
man
of
the
island
had
hastened
hospitably
out
to
welcome
the
newcomers
peggy
jess
and
jimsy
exchanged
glances
the
prospect
of
spending
the
afternoon
marooned
on
an
island
with
fanning
harding
and
regina
mortlake
was
not
alluring
but
there
was
no
escape
the
next
minute
the
man
of
the
island
ushered
in
his
two
new
guests
what
you
here
said
fanning
in
an
ungracious
tone
while
regina
mortlake
more
skilled
at
disguising
her
feelings
exclaimed
oh
how
perfectly
wonderful
that
we
should
both
have
landed
on
the
same
island
it
was
from
choice
grumbled
fanning
in
a
perfectly
audible
tone
jimsy
flushed
a
dark
dangerous
flush
jess
tell
me
not
to
punch
that
chap
he
muttered
to
his
sister
i
certainly
do
tell
you
not
to
whispered
jess
emphatically
the
man
of
the
island
looked
on
wonderingly
did
you
come
in
an
aeroplane
too
he
asked
fanning
in
the
manner
of
a
man
prepared
to
hear
any
marvels
yes
we
had
the
race
won
too
but
this
fog
has
delayed
us
what
can
you
give
us
to
eat
i
can
pay
for
it
said
fanning
in
a
loud
rude
tone
i
do
take
pay
said
the
in
a
quiet
tone
that
ought
to
have
caused
fanning
to
redden
with
shame
but
if
you
are
hungry
i
can
cook
some
more
fish
there
are
plenty
of
potatoes
left
they
be
very
nice
i
sure
regina
had
the
grace
to
say
but
fanning
mumbled
something
about
pauper
food
but
nevertheless
he
ate
as
heartily
as
jimsy
himself
when
the
food
was
put
on
the
rough
table
it
was
hard
work
trying
to
be
pleasant
to
the
two
young
people
who
had
so
unexpectedly
come
into
their
midst
and
the
conversation
languished
and
went
on
by
fits
and
starts
hullo
the
fog
lifting
cried
fanning
suddenly
i
off
come
on
regina
the
girl
rose
and
as
she
did
so
the
trio
from
the
prescott
machine
noticed
the
island
dweller
eyes
fixed
on
her
in
a
curious
way
pardon
me
he
said
but
is
your
name
regina
the
girl
looked
at
him
in
a
way
while
peggy
as
she
said
afterward
felt
as
if
she
was
watching
a
drama
yes
she
said
why
because
said
the
island
dweller
slowly
because
i
once
knew
someone
called
regina
who
was
very
dear
to
me
come
on
called
fanning
from
outside
we
got
to
win
this
race
back
the
girl
lingered
hesitatingly
an
instant
and
the
next
moment
was
gone
the
fog
is
lifting
said
peggy
we
must
be
going
too
come
along
jess
come
on
jimsy
we
do
want
to
let
the
mortlake
craft
beat
us
at
the
eleventh
hour
what
name
was
that
you
just
mentioned
asked
the
man
of
the
island
quickly
he
was
bending
forward
eagerly
as
if
to
catch
the
answer
do
you
mean
mortlake
yes
that
the
name
what
of
him
do
you
know
him
the
man
eyes
gleamed
brightly
he
seemed
to
be
much
excited
peggy
answered
him
calmly
although
she
felt
as
if
some
sort
of
a
life
tragedy
was
working
out
to
swift
conclusion
of
course
eugene
mortlake
is
the
man
who
is
manufacturing
the
mortlake
aeroplane
he
is
our
chief
rival
that
the
reason
we
must
hurry
off
why
did
they
the
man
nodded
his
head
in
the
direction
in
which
fanning
and
regina
had
vanished
did
they
come
in
a
mortlake
aeroplane
yes
said
peggy
did
you
know
that
girl
is
daughter
regina
mortlake
the
man
gave
a
terrible
cry
and
reeled
backward
jimsy
stepped
forward
quickly
and
caught
him
for
an
instant
they
thought
their
host
was
going
to
swoon
but
he
quickly
recovered
good
heavens
he
cried
eugene
mortlake
is
here
close
at
hand
he
is
in
hampton
why
i
must
see
him
as
soon
as
possible
no
i
can
explain
nothing
now
but
i
must
see
him
the
man
manner
showed
that
he
was
terribly
in
earnest
he
seemed
almost
carried
away
by
excitement
outside
came
suddenly
a
whirring
sound
fanning
is
starting
his
engine
exclaimed
jimsy
we
must
hurry
will
you
do
something
for
me
will
you
aid
a
miserable
outcast
to
right
a
great
wrong
pleaded
the
ragged
man
who
faced
them
what
can
we
do
for
you
asked
jimsy
take
me
back
to
hampton
in
your
aeroplane
i
must
see
mortlake
at
once
it
is
imperative
i
tell
you
see
i
am
not
poor
although
i
appear
so
in
two
strides
the
man
had
crossed
the
room
and
lifting
a
board
in
the
floor
he
drew
forth
bag
after
bag
the
seams
of
some
of
them
were
rotten
under
the
sudden
strain
they
broke
and
streams
of
gold
coin
trickled
out
upon
the
floor
years
ago
when
i
was
first
an
exile
here
said
the
man
a
spanish
ship
came
ashore
one
stormy
night
not
a
soul
of
her
crew
was
saved
i
found
this
money
in
the
wreck
i
will
give
you
half
of
it
if
you
will
take
me
to
hampton
with
you
the
other
half
i
must
keep
till
till
i
learn
from
mortlake
lips
the
secret
he
holds
put
your
money
back
said
jimsy
quietly
after
a
telegraphic
exchange
of
looks
with
peggy
we
take
you
to
hampton
but
hurry
fifteen
minutes
later
a
aeroplane
flashed
past
the
cape
charles
light
the
announcer
posted
there
instantly
sent
in
a
wireless
flash
to
hampton
number
six
has
just
passed
two
minutes
behind
number
five
the
four
persons
on
board
mortlake
was
among
the
crowd
that
read
the
bulletin
which
was
instantly
posted
upon
the
field
outside
hampton
i
wonder
who
the
fourth
can
be
he
thought
little
guessing
that
through
the
air
fate
was
winging
its
way
toward
him
anyway
he
added
to
himself
the
next
instant
the
is
leading
now
if
only
but
what
was
that
roar
at
first
a
sullen
boom
gradually
deepening
into
the
excited
skirling
cheers
of
a
vast
throng
mortlake
looked
round
startled
out
of
the
distance
two
tiny
dots
momentarily
growing
larger
like
homing
birds
had
come
into
view
hark
what
was
that
the
crowd
were
shouting
those
with
field
glasses
threw
the
cry
out
first
and
then
came
a
mighty
roar
as
it
was
caught
up
by
hundreds
of
throats
the
nameless
the
nameless
wins
mortlake
paled
and
caught
at
a
post
erected
to
hold
up
a
telephone
line
he
gazed
at
the
oncoming
aeroplanes
there
were
three
of
them
now
but
one
was
far
behind
laboring
slowly
but
the
first
was
unquestionably
the
he
could
catch
the
yellow
glint
of
her
wings
and
that
second
craft
its
silvery
sheen
betrayed
it
was
the
mortlake
as
roy
had
called
it
come
on
come
on
shouted
mortlake
uselessly
as
he
knew
what
the
matter
with
you
but
alas
the
did
come
on
some
three
or
four
minutes
after
the
had
alighted
and
been
swallowed
up
in
a
surging
yelling
throng
of
aero
fans
the
fluttered
wearily
to
the
ground
unnoticed
almost
amid
the
excitement
over
the
feat
mortlake
raged
old
harding
almost
wept
and
fanning
sulkily
explained
that
it
was
his
fault
the
cylinders
having
overheated
again
but
not
all
of
this
could
wipe
out
those
figures
that
had
just
been
put
up
on
the
board
which
proclaimed
a
victory
for
the
prescott
aeroplane
by
a
margin
of
three
and
hundredths
minutes
chapter
xxiv
friends
and
foes
conclusion
the
winning
of
the
sky
cruise
as
the
newspapers
had
dubbed
it
was
the
talk
of
hampton
that
night
not
a
small
part
of
the
zest
with
which
it
was
discussed
was
caused
by
the
fact
that
a
young
girl
had
driven
the
machine
through
its
daring
dash
the
wires
from
new
york
baltimore
philadelphia
boston
and
richmond
were
kept
hot
with
instructions
from
editors
to
their
representatives
demanding
interviews
with
the
girl
aviators
but
to
the
chagrin
of
the
newspaper
representatives
after
seeing
their
machine
housed
the
party
had
vanished
this
on
investigation
was
not
as
mysterious
as
it
had
at
first
appeared
there
was
a
small
door
in
the
back
of
the
nameless
shed
and
at
this
door
there
had
been
waiting
for
some
moments
before
the
conclusion
of
the
race
a
big
automobile
in
it
were
seated
a
bronzed
man
with
broad
shoulders
and
an
alert
wideawake
expression
and
a
boy
whose
foot
was
propped
up
on
an
extemporized
contrivance
affixed
to
the
seat
while
the
crowd
had
hovered
about
the
front
of
the
shed
awaiting
the
reappearance
of
the
girl
aviator
whose
feat
had
caused
such
a
furore
this
boy
had
limped
from
the
machine
assisted
by
his
stalwart
companion
and
had
entered
the
shed
by
the
rear
door
it
would
have
astonished
the
crowd
and
delighted
the
reporters
in
search
of
a
story
if
they
could
have
seen
peggy
rush
at
the
youth
and
with
a
wild
cry
of
roy
you
darling
throw
her
arms
about
his
neck
bell
for
he
was
the
stalwart
personage
stood
aside
with
a
look
of
warm
satisfaction
as
peggy
turn
over
jess
and
jimsy
came
forward
what
a
joyous
reunion
that
was
i
will
leave
you
to
imagine
then
came
bell
story
of
his
telegram
to
sandy
beach
to
the
judge
who
was
a
friend
of
his
the
message
had
announced
that
he
had
obtained
complete
confessions
from
both
joey
eccles
and
the
unsavory
slim
roy
release
from
bail
and
suspicion
at
once
followed
eccles
had
owned
up
to
his
part
in
the
mischief
that
had
been
wrought
against
the
young
prescotts
frankly
and
without
reserve
he
had
sworn
to
a
statement
before
a
local
attorney
in
which
he
admitted
losing
the
bill
with
the
mark
upon
it
on
the
night
he
had
aided
in
decoying
roy
to
the
old
house
his
assistant
had
been
a
cast
off
workman
of
the
mortlake
plant
of
whose
whereabouts
joey
said
he
was
now
ignorant
then
had
come
slim
turn
sullenly
but
with
the
alternative
of
prison
staring
him
in
the
face
he
had
admitted
to
impersonating
the
foreign
spy
the
part
of
roy
on
that
eventful
night
had
been
played
by
guess
whom
said
bell
looking
round
they
all
shook
their
heads
i
tell
you
about
that
part
of
it
later
said
bell
there
are
still
one
or
two
things
to
be
cleared
up
in
that
connection
but
he
continued
palmer
confessed
that
it
was
mortlake
who
robbed
the
safe
the
object
being
of
course
not
so
much
the
money
as
a
chance
to
put
roy
out
of
the
race
contest
it
has
been
a
record
of
vile
plotting
all
the
way
through
said
the
westerner
warmly
but
the
toils
are
closing
in
about
mortlake
of
course
my
first
step
was
to
take
the
fellows
before
an
attorney
luckily
i
knew
one
in
hampton
and
he
as
it
happened
was
a
friend
of
the
sandy
beach
judge
we
had
to
move
quickly
but
thanks
to
the
telegraph
wire
and
fast
trains
i
got
roy
released
from
bail
and
suspicion
and
here
in
time
to
greet
you
they
could
only
look
their
gratitude
just
as
the
strain
was
becoming
almost
too
taut
bell
who
had
noticed
it
broke
the
tension
let
sneak
out
of
the
back
door
he
said
and
all
go
to
some
quiet
place
to
dine
hullo
who
this
he
exclaimed
as
the
tattered
figure
of
the
man
of
the
island
appeared
i
am
what
is
left
of
budd
pierce
jim
bell
said
the
man
in
his
queer
tired
tones
budd
pierce
exclaimed
the
mining
man
falling
back
a
step
no
but
yes
now
i
look
again
it
is
but
man
what
has
happened
to
you
what
are
you
doing
here
it
a
long
story
said
the
ragged
man
while
the
younger
members
of
the
party
looked
on
in
astonishment
but
i
can
tell
you
that
gene
mortlake
has
reached
the
end
of
his
tether
i
heard
all
you
said
about
him
and
my
interest
in
him
you
know
already
i
know
that
you
were
swindled
out
of
your
fortune
by
some
man
years
ago
and
then
disappeared
said
bell
but
i
had
forgotten
the
name
of
the
rascal
it
was
eugene
mortlake
said
the
man
of
the
island
slowly
after
i
knew
i
was
ruined
i
fled
down
here
where
i
was
raised
and
became
a
recluse
on
that
island
it
was
cowardly
of
me
i
know
but
from
now
on
i
am
going
to
lead
a
different
life
you
have
found
yourself
cried
james
bell
gleefully
clasping
the
other
thin
worn
hand
i
have
found
something
dearer
to
me
was
the
quiet
reply
but
come
let
us
be
going
i
have
much
that
is
strange
to
tell
you
with
wondering
looks
the
young
aviators
roy
leaning
on
peggy
devoted
arm
followed
james
bell
and
the
man
from
lost
brig
island
out
of
the
aeroplane
shed
in
his
suite
of
rooms
at
the
hotel
hampton
the
best
hotel
in
the
place
eugene
mortlake
sat
opposite
old
harding
his
brow
was
furrowed
and
little
wrinkles
that
had
not
been
there
earlier
in
the
day
appeared
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes
old
harding
seemed
to
be
trying
to
cheer
him
up
in
another
corner
of
the
room
sullen
and
depressed
fanning
harding
was
standing
puffing
a
cigarette
and
filling
the
atmosphere
with
its
reeking
fumes
all
is
not
lost
yet
mortlake
hey
hey
hey
said
the
old
man
laying
a
skinny
hand
on
the
other
arm
why
we
put
into
execution
a
plan
that
will
permanently
put
these
young
prescotts
out
of
it
fanning
knows
what
i
mean
hey
he
glanced
up
at
his
son
i
know
fast
enough
said
that
young
hopeful
but
it
a
risky
matter
why
do
you
get
somebody
else
to
do
it
pshaw
it
only
filing
off
a
padlock
and
then
smashing
a
few
of
the
motor
parts
said
the
old
man
in
as
calm
a
tone
as
if
he
were
proposing
a
constitutional
walk
that
soon
done
hey
a
sharp
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
any
reply
fanning
might
have
been
about
to
make
come
in
snarled
mortlake
it
the
mail
i
suppose
he
said
turning
to
old
harding
but
to
his
surprise
and
consternation
the
opened
door
revealed
roy
prescott
close
behind
him
came
bell
and
peggy
with
jimsy
and
jess
bringing
up
the
rear
to
what
am
i
indebted
for
the
pleasure
of
this
visit
asked
mortlake
glowering
at
the
newcomers
as
they
filed
in
and
bell
closed
the
door
behind
them
why
did
you
send
up
your
cards
and
i
have
torn
them
up
and
thrown
them
out
of
the
window
just
what
i
thought
you
do
so
we
came
up
ourselves
said
bell
cheerily
now
look
here
mortlake
no
sit
down
i
come
up
here
to
right
a
wrong
you
tried
to
do
all
in
your
power
to
injure
these
young
people
whose
only
fault
is
that
they
have
built
a
better
aeroplane
than
you
have
it
their
turn
now
and
you
got
to
grin
and
bear
it
mortlake
jaw
dropped
his
old
bullying
manner
was
gone
now
old
man
harding
cackled
inanely
but
said
nothing
only
his
long
lean
fingers
drummed
on
the
table
fanning
turned
a
pasty
yellow
he
had
some
idea
of
what
was
to
come
his
eyes
fell
to
the
floor
as
if
seeking
some
loophole
of
escape
there
well
growled
mortlake
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
not
much
snapped
the
mining
man
but
i
wish
to
read
you
something
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
paper
this
is
the
confession
of
joey
eccles
he
said
quietly
i
another
by
frederick
palmer
mortlake
leaped
up
and
sprang
toward
the
westerner
but
bell
held
up
his
hand
do
try
to
destroy
them
he
said
they
are
only
copies
the
originals
are
by
this
time
in
the
hands
of
the
authorities
at
sandy
beach
mortlake
sank
back
with
staring
eyes
and
white
cheeks
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
gasped
listen
to
these
confessions
and
then
sign
your
name
to
them
signifying
your
belief
that
they
are
true
documents
and
if
not
well
if
not
said
bell
measuring
his
words
do
you
recollect
that
gold
mine
scheme
you
were
interested
in
more
years
ago
than
you
care
to
remember
mortlake
seemed
to
shrivel
but
he
flared
up
in
a
last
blaze
of
defiance
you
ca
scare
me
by
rattling
old
bones
he
said
what
do
you
know
about
it
for
reply
bell
stepped
to
the
door
budd
he
called
softly
and
in
response
the
man
of
lost
brig
island
but
now
dressed
and
barbered
into
civilization
appeared
pierce
budd
gasped
mortlake
yes
pierce
budd
whom
you
ruined
said
bell
but
for
my
persuasions
he
would
have
sought
to
wipe
out
his
wrongs
in
personal
violence
but
you
need
fear
him
now
as
mortlake
looked
round
with
hunted
eyes
that
is
if
you
sign
i
sign
gasped
out
the
trapped
man
he
reached
for
an
inkstand
give
them
to
me
i
read
them
first
said
the
mining
man
and
then
in
slow
measured
tones
he
read
out
the
contents
of
the
convicting
documents
as
he
concluded
mortlake
seemed
about
to
collapse
but
he
took
the
papers
with
a
trembling
hand
and
wrote
all
this
is
eugene
mortlake
good
said
bell
now
your
future
fate
is
in
the
hands
of
these
young
people
pierce
budd
has
forgiven
you
though
it
has
been
a
struggle
to
do
so
but
i
have
one
surprise
left
for
you
all
said
bell
stepping
to
the
door
regina
he
called
softly
in
reply
the
girl
in
a
sheer
dress
of
soft
clinging
stuff
glided
into
the
room
she
slipped
straight
to
the
side
of
the
outcast
pierce
budd
and
stood
there
holding
his
hand
peggy
looking
at
her
in
amazement
saw
that
the
hard
defiant
look
had
vanished
from
the
face
and
that
its
place
had
been
taken
by
an
expression
of
supreme
happiness
and
peace
tell
them
about
it
said
bell
no
she
has
not
yet
recovered
from
the
shock
of
the
discovery
said
pierce
budd
softly
let
me
do
it
when
mortlake
ruined
me
and
i
fled
from
my
former
surroundings
he
said
i
left
behind
me
a
baby
girl
mortlake
a
good
woman
if
ever
there
was
one
took
care
of
that
child
all
this
i
have
only
just
learned
she
grew
up
with
the
mortlake
and
when
that
man
wife
died
he
did
the
only
good
thing
i
ever
heard
of
him
doing
he
took
care
of
her
and
brought
her
up
as
his
daughter
in
the
hut
you
saw
me
looking
at
her
closely
it
was
because
i
thought
i
recognized
a
bit
of
jewelry
a
tiny
gold
locket
she
wore
it
contained
the
picture
of
her
mother
who
died
soon
after
her
birth
when
i
heard
her
name
was
regina
and
on
the
top
of
that
heard
you
mention
the
name
of
mortlake
i
knew
that
fate
in
its
strange
whirligig
had
brought
my
daughter
back
to
me
with
bell
i
sought
her
and
she
has
consented
to
forgive
me
for
my
years
of
neglect
the
rest
of
my
life
will
be
spent
in
atoning
for
the
past
that
is
all
his
voice
broke
and
regina
a
different
regina
from
the
old
defiant
one
gazed
up
at
him
tenderly
so
said
mortlake
i
left
alone
at
last
eh
regina
have
you
a
word
for
me
wo
you
forgive
me
for
deceiving
you
about
your
father
all
these
years
of
course
i
forgive
freely
and
wholly
said
the
girl
stepping
toward
him
but
it
is
hard
to
forget
very
tenderly
mortlake
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
then
he
drew
himself
erect
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
me
he
said
defiantly
i
confessed
everything
why
do
you
call
the
police
because
we
want
you
to
have
a
chance
to
be
a
better
man
said
bell
the
past
is
over
and
done
with
the
future
lies
before
you
you
can
make
it
what
you
will
bad
or
good
we
shall
not
interfere
with
you
mortlake
looked
at
them
unsteadily
then
his
voice
broke
and
he
stepped
quickly
toward
budd
the
recluse
of
lost
brig
island
extended
his
lean
palm
and
met
the
other
outstretched
hand
half
way
i
bear
no
grudge
mortlake
he
said
you
will
always
be
welcome
at
our
home
regina
and
mine
oh
yes
always
cried
the
girl
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
thank
you
said
mortlake
simply
i
do
i
do
dare
trust
myself
to
speak
now
perhaps
he
strode
abruptly
through
the
door
and
was
gone
old
harding
arose
to
his
feet
after
this
affecting
tableau
is
there
anything
you
wish
to
say
to
me
hey
he
grated
out
nothing
sir
said
bell
turning
his
back
upon
the
wizened
old
financier
i
have
seen
to
it
that
the
money
taken
from
them
has
been
returned
to
the
galloways
then
i
bid
you
too
since
you
seem
to
have
taken
possession
of
these
rooms
come
fanning
without
a
word
fanning
shuffled
across
the
room
and
reached
his
side
not
till
they
were
both
at
the
door
did
he
speak
then
with
a
malevolent
look
backward
he
paused
roy
prescott
he
said
you
always
beaten
me
out
at
school
at
college
and
twice
since
we
both
lived
in
sandy
beach
there
be
a
third
time
and
you
can
bet
that
i
not
forget
the
injury
you
done
me
good
night
he
was
gone
a
sinister
sneer
still
curling
his
lip
well
said
bell
looking
round
him
with
a
smile
who
says
that
all
the
adventure
and
excitement
is
in
the
west
not
the
girl
aviators
certainly
laughed
peggy
stealing
a
look
at
regina
the
girl
colored
and
then
after
a
visible
effort
she
spoke
i
want
to
say
something
she
said
and
stopped
her
father
bent
on
her
an
encouraging
look
bravely
she
nerved
herself
and
went
on
it
it
was
i
who
dressed
up
like
you
that
night
roy
prescott
and
and
i
awfully
sorry
oh
that
all
right
said
roy
uneasily
and
then
say
you
can
run
like
a
deer
in
the
laugh
which
followed
they
left
the
room
and
adjourned
to
a
jolly
supper
at
which
who
should
walk
in
but
aunt
sally
prescott
and
and
bancroft
they
had
been
reached
by
telegraph
early
that
morning
and
had
started
on
the
next
train
to
roy
how
the
hours
flew
it
was
almost
midnight
before
they
knew
it
in
the
midst
of
the
feast
a
waiter
brought
in
a
message
to
bell
the
mining
man
excused
himself
and
left
the
room
for
a
short
time
when
he
returned
he
was
smiling
i
just
signed
on
two
new
workmen
for
the
mine
he
said
and
i
think
they
make
good
who
are
they
asked
roy
well
one
answers
to
the
name
of
eccles
the
other
was
on
one
occasion
a
foreign
spy
but
he
bears
the
very
american
name
of
palmer
they
leave
for
the
west
how
the
prescott
aeroplane
under
roy
management
captured
the
coveted
highest
number
of
marks
for
proficiency
and
how
a
sensation
was
caused
by
the
sudden
withdrawal
of
the
mortlake
aeroplanes
from
the
naval
contest
all
my
readers
are
familiar
with
through
the
columns
of
the
daily
press
the
paper
though
did
print
anything
about
an
offer
made
by
pierce
budd
to
eugene
mortlake
to
finance
the
type
of
machine
needless
to
say
the
offer
was
not
accepted
mortlake
a
changed
man
is
now
building
and
selling
aeroplanes
in
a
far
eastern
principality
and
they
are
good
ones
too
no
letters
are
more
welcome
than
those
that
arrive
occasionally
from
him
and
are
delivered
at
pierce
budd
home
in
new
