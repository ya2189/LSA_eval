the
title
of
this
book
rings
in
the
ear
with
a
pleasant
sound
stories
from
dickens
stories
alone
usually
suggests
such
delightful
rambles
in
the
land
of
dreams
and
when
it
is
coupled
with
the
name
of
a
king
of
by
divine
right
the
charm
is
increased
a
hundredfold
these
stories
the
title
directly
from
dickens
very
largely
in
his
own
language
and
always
faithful
to
his
spirit
they
are
the
stories
of
his
most
famous
boys
and
girls
merely
separated
from
the
big
books
and
crowded
scenes
where
they
first
appeared
in
stage
talk
the
has
been
turned
upon
them
alone
their
early
joys
and
sorrows
are
shown
but
always
with
more
of
the
smiles
than
the
tears
there
is
sadness
enough
in
real
life
without
emphasizing
it
in
books
for
young
people
and
so
only
two
of
the
numerous
deathbed
scenes
found
in
dickens
are
given
place
here
the
book
is
not
intended
as
a
substitute
however
small
for
the
complete
texts
but
is
offered
in
the
reverent
hope
that
it
will
serve
as
both
introduction
and
incentive
to
the
bulky
volumes
which
so
often
alarm
young
people
by
their
very
size
the
compiler
has
in
mind
one
child
of
the
long
ago
who
looked
with
awe
upon
a
stately
row
of
fat
books
kept
for
show
like
mummies
in
a
high
glass
case
and
labelled
dickens
this
child
never
suspected
that
the
books
were
intended
for
any
rate
not
by
children
so
he
contented
himself
for
the
time
with
trashy
little
books
with
highly
colored
pictures
intended
for
children
what
a
world
of
delight
would
have
been
opened
to
him
if
some
one
had
placed
in
his
hands
the
story
of
oliver
twist
or
the
first
part
of
nicholas
nickleby
relating
to
hall
or
the
early
history
of
david
copperfield
he
might
have
demanded
of
story
or
some
of
the
inimitable
christmas
tales
afterwards
he
would
have
read
on
and
on
for
himself
to
other
such
children
this
book
comes
as
a
friendly
guide
to
it
is
barely
necessary
to
add
that
the
book
is
in
different
vein
from
an
earlier
handbook

is

story
of

oliver
begins
life
in
a
hard
some
years
ago
when
the
poorhouses
of
england
were
in
a
bad
state
and
the
poor
people
housed
within
them
were
often
a
little
waif
began
his
life
under
the
roof
of
one
of
the
worst
of
them
his
mother
had
wandered
there
weak
wretched
and
without
friends
it
seemed
for
she
gave
no
clue
to
her
identity
and
after
her
little
boy
was
born
she
had
only
strength
enough
to
kiss
him
once
before
she
breathed
her
last
as
no
one
knew
anything
about
her
the
child
became
a
charge
upon
the
parish
he
was
sent
with
other
orphans
and
homeless
little
ones
to
be
cared
for
by
an
elderly
woman
named
mann
who
received
from
the
parish
officers
but
a
scant
allowance
for
the
needs
of
the
children
to
whom
she
gave
in
the
shape
of
food
and
attention
a
still
shorter
return
and
so
the
first
years
of
this
life
were
devoted
mainly
to
the
struggle
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
he
won
the
fight
by
the
narrowest
of
margins
and
his
ninth
birthday
found
him
a
pale
thin
lad
somewhat
short
in
stature
and
decidedly
small
in
girth
but
nature
had
placed
a
good
sturdy
spirit
in
his
breast
it
had
plenty
of
room
to
expand
thanks
to
the
spare
diet
else
he
might
not
have
had
any
ninth
birthday
at
all
on
this
momentous
day
he
received
a
visitor
in
the
person
of
bumble
the
fat
and
pompous
beadle
of
the
workhouse
who
came
to
see
mann
in
all
the
glory
of
his
cocked
hat
and
brass
buttons
good
morning
said
the
beadle
taking
out
a
leathern
the
child
that
was
half
baptized
oliver
twist
is
nine
year
old
bless
him
interposed
mann
inflaming
her
left
eye
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
and
notwithstanding
a
offered
reward
of
ten
pound
which
was
afterwards
increased
to
twenty
pound
notwithstanding
the
most
superlative
and
i
may
say
exertions
on
the
part
of
this
parish
said
bumble
we
have
never
been
able
to
discover
who
is
his
father
or
what
was
his
settlement
name
or
mann
raised
her
hands
in
astonishment
but
added
after
a
reflection
how
comes
he
to
have
any
name
at
all
then
the
beadle
drew
himself
up
with
great
pride
and
said
i
inwented
it
you
mr
bumble
i
mann
we
name
our
foundlings
in
alphabetical
order
the
last
was
a
s
i
named
him
this
was
a
t
i
named
the
next
one
as
comes
will
be
unwin
and
the
next
vilkins
i
have
got
names
ready
made
to
the
end
of
the
alphabet
and
all
the
way
through
it
again
when
we
come
to
z
why
quite
a
literary
character
sir
said
mann
well
well
said
the
beadle
evidently
gratified
with
the
compliment
perhaps
i
may
be
but
the
boy
oliver
being
now
too
old
to
remain
here
the
board
have
determined
to
have
him
back
into
the
house
i
have
come
out
myself
to
take
him
there
so
let
me
see
him
at
once
fetch
him
directly
said
mann
leaving
the
room
for
that
purpose
and
so
oliver
having
had
as
much
of
the
outer
coat
of
dirt
which
encrusted
his
face
and
hands
removed
as
could
be
scrubbed
off
in
one
washing
was
presently
led
into
the
room
make
a
bow
to
the
gentleman
oliver
said
mann
oliver
made
a
bow
which
was
divided
between
the
beadle
on
the
chair
and
the
cocked
hat
on
the
table
will
you
go
along
with
me
oliver
said
bumble
in
a
majestic
voice
oliver
was
about
to
say
that
he
would
go
along
with
anybody
with
great
readiness
when
glancing
upwards
he
caught
sight
of
mann
who
had
got
behind
the
chair
and
was
shaking
her
fist
at
him
with
a
furious
countenance
he
took
the
hint
at
once
for
the
fist
had
been
too
often
impressed
upon
his
body
not
to
be
deeply
impressed
upon
his
memory
will
go
with
me
he
inquired
no
she
replied
bumble
but
come
and
see
you
sometimes
this
was
no
very
great
consolation
to
the
child
young
as
he
was
however
he
had
sense
enough
to
pretend
great
regret
at
going
away
it
was
no
very
difficult
matter
for
the
boy
to
call
the
tears
into
his
eyes
hunger
and
recent
are
great
assistants
if
you
want
to
cry
and
oliver
cried
very
naturally
indeed
mann
gave
him
a
thousand
embraces
and
what
oliver
wanted
a
great
deal
more
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
lest
he
should
seem
too
hungry
when
he
got
to
the
workhouse
with
the
slice
of
bread
in
his
hand
and
the
little
parish
cap
on
his
head
the
boy
was
then
led
away
by
bumble
from
the
wretched
home
where
one
kind
word
or
look
had
never
lighted
the
gloom
of
his
infant
years
bumble
walked
on
with
long
strides
and
little
oliver
firmly
grasping
his
cuff
trotted
beside
him
inquiring
at
the
end
of
every
quarter
of
a
mile
whether
they
were
nearly
there
to
these
interrogations
bumble
returned
very
brief
and
snappish
replies
for
was
he
not
a
beadle
but
at
last
they
were
there
and
the
boy
was
looking
at
his
new
home
with
interest
not
unmixed
with
dread
oliver
had
not
been
within
the
walls
of
the
workhouse
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
had
scarcely
completed
the
slice
of
bread
when
bumble
who
had
handed
him
over
to
the
care
of
an
old
woman
returned
and
telling
him
it
was
a
board
night
took
him
before
that
august
body
forthwith
bow
to
the
board
said
bumble
oliver
brushed
away
two
or
three
tears
that
were
lingering
in
his
eyes
and
seeing
no
board
but
the
table
fortunately
bowed
to
that
your
name
boy
said
a
gentleman
in
a
high
chair
oliver
was
frightened
at
the
sight
of
so
many
fat
gentlemen
and
the
beadle
gave
him
another
tap
behind
which
made
him
cry
these
two
causes
made
him
answer
in
a
very
low
and
hesitating
voice
whereupon
a
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
said
he
was
a
fool
was
a
capital
way
of
raising
his
spirits
and
putting
him
quite
at
his
ease
boy
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
listen
to
me
you
know
an
orphan
i
suppose
that
sir
inquired
poor
oliver
the
boy
a
thought
he
was
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
hush
said
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
first
you
know
got
no
father
or
mother
and
that
you
were
brought
up
by
the
parish
you
yes
sir
replied
oliver
weeping
bitterly
what
are
you
crying
for
inquired
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
and
to
be
sure
it
was
very
extraordinary
what
the
boy
be
crying
for
i
hope
you
say
your
prayers
every
night
said
another
gentleman
in
a
gruff
voice
and
pray
for
the
people
who
feed
you
and
take
care
of
a
christian
yes
sir
stammered
the
boy
the
gentleman
who
spoke
last
was
unconsciously
right
it
would
have
been
like
a
christian
and
a
marvellously
good
christian
too
if
oliver
had
prayed
for
the
people
who
fed
and
took
care
of
but
he
because
nobody
had
taught
him
well
you
have
come
here
to
be
educated
and
taught
a
useful
trade
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
so
begin
to
pick
oakum
morning
at
six
added
the
surly
one
in
the
white
waistcoat
for
the
combination
of
both
these
blessings
in
the
one
simple
process
of
picking
oakum
oliver
bowed
low
by
the
direction
of
the
beadle
and
was
hurried
away
to
a
large
ward
where
on
a
rough
hard
bed
he
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
poor
oliver
he
little
knew
as
he
fell
asleep
that
the
board
had
just
reached
a
sage
decision
in
his
and
other
cases
but
they
had
and
this
was
it
the
members
of
this
board
were
very
wise
men
and
when
they
came
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
they
found
out
at
once
what
ordinary
folks
would
never
have
the
poor
people
liked
it
oho
said
the
board
stop
all
this
high
living
in
no
time
so
they
brought
the
diet
down
to
the
edge
of
starvation
they
contracted
with
the
waterworks
to
lay
on
an
unlimited
supply
of
water
and
with
a
mill
to
supply
small
quantities
of
oatmeal
and
issued
three
meals
of
thin
gruel
a
day
and
half
a
roll
on
sundays
for
the
first
six
months
after
oliver
twist
was
removed
the
system
was
in
full
operation
it
was
rather
expensive
at
first
in
consequence
of
the
increase
in
the
bill
and
the
necessity
of
taking
in
the
clothes
of
all
the
paupers
which
fluttered
loosely
on
their
wasted
shrunken
forms
after
a
week
or
gruel
but
the
number
of
workhouse
inmates
got
thin
as
well
as
the
paupers
and
the
board
were
delighted
the
room
in
which
the
boys
were
fed
was
a
large
stone
hall
with
a
copper
kettle
at
one
end
out
of
which
the
master
dressed
in
an
apron
for
the
purpose
and
assisted
by
one
or
two
women
ladled
the
gruel
at
meal
times
of
this
festive
composition
each
boy
had
one
porringer
and
no
on
occasions
of
great
public
rejoicing
when
he
had
two
ounces
and
a
quarter
of
bread
besides
the
bowls
never
wanted
washing
the
boys
polished
them
with
their
spoons
till
they
shone
again
and
when
they
had
performed
this
operation
which
never
took
very
long
the
spoons
being
nearly
as
large
as
the
bowls
they
would
sit
staring
at
the
kettle
with
eager
eyes
as
if
they
could
have
devoured
the
very
bricks
of
which
it
was
composed
employing
themselves
meanwhile
in
sucking
their
fingers
with
the
view
of
catching
up
any
stray
splashes
of
gruel
that
might
have
been
cast
thereon
illustration
oliver
asks
for
more
boys
have
generally
excellent
appetites
oliver
twist
and
his
companions
suffered
the
tortures
of
slow
starvation
for
three
months
until
at
last
they
got
so
voracious
and
wild
with
hunger
that
one
boy
who
was
tall
for
his
age
and
been
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
for
his
father
had
kept
a
small
shop
hinted
darkly
to
his
companions
that
unless
he
had
another
basin
of
gruel
he
was
afraid
he
might
eat
the
boy
who
slept
next
him
who
happened
to
be
a
weakly
youth
of
tender
age
he
had
a
wild
hungry
eye
and
they
implicitly
believed
him
a
council
was
held
and
lots
were
cast
to
decide
who
should
walk
up
to
the
master
after
supper
that
evening
and
ask
for
more
and
it
fell
to
oliver
twist
the
evening
arrived
and
the
boys
took
their
places
the
master
in
his
uniform
stationed
himself
at
the
kettle
his
pauper
assistants
ranged
themselves
behind
him
the
gruel
was
served
out
and
a
long
grace
was
said
over
the
short
rations
the
gruel
disappeared
the
boys
whispered
to
each
other
and
winked
at
oliver
while
his
next
neighbors
nudged
him
child
as
he
was
he
was
desperate
with
hunger
and
reckless
with
misery
he
rose
from
the
table
and
advancing
to
the
master
basin
and
spoon
in
hand
said
somewhat
alarmed
at
his
own
temerity
please
sir
i
want
some
more
the
master
was
a
fat
healthy
man
but
he
turned
very
pale
he
gazed
in
stupefied
astonishment
on
the
small
rebel
for
some
seconds
and
then
clung
for
support
to
the
copper
the
assistants
were
paralyzed
with
wonder
the
boys
with
fear
what
said
the
master
at
length
in
a
faint
voice
please
sir
replied
oliver
i
want
some
more
the
master
aimed
a
blow
at
head
with
the
ladle
pinioned
him
in
his
arms
and
shrieked
aloud
for
the
beadle
the
board
were
sitting
in
solemn
conclave
when
bumble
rushed
into
the
room
in
great
excitement
and
addressing
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
said
limbkins
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
oliver
twist
has
asked
for
more
there
was
a
general
start
horror
was
depicted
on
every
countenance
for
said
limbkins
compose
yourself
bumble
and
answer
me
distinctly
do
i
understand
that
he
asked
for
more
after
he
had
eaten
the
supper
allotted
by
the
dietary
he
did
sir
replied
bumble
that
boy
will
be
hung
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
i
know
that
boy
will
be
hung
nobody
disputed
this
opinion
an
animated
discussion
took
place
oliver
was
ordered
into
instant
confinement
and
a
bill
was
posted
on
the
outside
of
the
gate
offering
a
reward
of
five
pounds
to
anybody
who
would
take
oliver
twist
off
the
hands
of
the
parish
in
other
words
five
pounds
and
oliver
twist
were
offered
to
any
man
or
woman
who
wanted
an
apprentice
to
any
trade
business
or
calling
oliver
had
a
very
narrow
escape
a
few
days
later
as
the
result
of
this
bill
from
a
man
who
wanted
a
but
finally
he
became
the
apprentice
of
an
undertaker
named
sowerberry
his
life
here
was
some
improvement
over
the
workhouse
but
still
hard
enough
nevertheless
he
did
get
enough
to
eat
in
the
shape
of
broken
victuals
and
he
slept
among
the
coffins
in
the
shop
unfortunately
there
was
another
apprentice
a
great
overgrown
fellow
named
noah
claypole
who
delighted
to
bully
oliver
in
every
way
possible
oliver
stood
it
as
long
as
he
could
but
noah
mistook
his
attitude
for
cowardice
and
added
insults
to
rough
usage
but
one
day
noah
spoke
ill
of
the
dead
mother
what
did
you
say
asked
oliver
quickly
a
regular
bad
she
was
repeated
noah
coolly
crimson
with
fury
oliver
started
up
overthrew
the
chair
and
table
seized
noah
by
the
throat
shook
him
in
the
violence
of
his
rage
till
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
and
collecting
his
whole
force
into
one
heavy
blow
felled
him
to
the
ground
a
minute
ago
the
boy
had
looked
the
quiet
mild
dejected
creature
that
harsh
treatment
had
made
him
but
his
spirit
was
roused
at
last
the
cruel
insult
had
set
his
blood
on
fire
his
breast
heaved
and
he
defied
his
tormentor
with
an
energy
he
had
never
known
before
murder
me
blubbered
noah
charlotte
missis
the
new
boy
of
me
help
help
gone
mad
his
cries
brought
the
fat
running
to
the
scene
oh
you
little
wretch
screamed
charlotte
seizing
oliver
with
her
utmost
force
which
was
about
equal
to
that
of
a
strong
man
in
good
training
oh
you
little
villain
and
between
every
syllable
charlotte
gave
oliver
a
blow
with
all
her
might
accompanying
it
with
a
scream
for
the
benefit
of
society
fist
was
by
no
means
a
light
one
but
lest
it
should
not
be
effectual
in
calming
wrath
sowerberry
plunged
into
the
kitchen
and
assisted
to
hold
him
with
one
hand
while
she
scratched
his
face
with
the
other
in
this
favorable
position
of
affairs
noah
rose
from
the
ground
and
pommelled
him
behind
this
was
rather
too
violent
exercise
to
last
long
when
they
were
all
three
wearied
out
and
could
tear
and
beat
no
longer
they
dragged
oliver
struggling
and
shouting
but
nothing
daunted
into
the
and
there
locked
him
up
this
being
done
sowerberry
sank
into
a
chair
and
burst
into
tears
oh
charlotte
she
cried
what
a
mercy
we
have
not
all
been
murdered
in
our
beds
with
such
a
little
villain
in
the
house
and
when
sowerberry
presently
came
home
he
gave
oliver
a
whipping
on
his
own
account
for
good
measure
it
was
not
until
he
was
left
alone
in
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the
cellar
that
oliver
gave
way
to
the
feelings
which
the
treatment
had
awakened
he
had
listened
to
their
taunts
with
a
look
of
contempt
he
had
borne
the
lash
without
a
cry
for
he
felt
that
pride
swelling
in
his
heart
which
would
have
kept
down
a
shriek
to
the
last
though
they
had
roasted
him
alive
but
now
when
there
was
none
to
see
or
hear
him
he
fell
upon
his
knees
on
the
floor
and
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
wept
bitter
tears
for
a
long
time
oliver
remained
motionless
in
this
attitude
the
candle
was
burning
low
in
the
socket
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
having
gazed
cautiously
round
him
and
listened
intently
he
gently
undid
the
fastenings
of
the
door
and
looked
abroad
it
was
a
cold
dark
night
the
stars
seemed
to
the
eyes
farther
from
the
earth
than
he
had
ever
seen
them
before
there
was
no
wind
and
the
sombre
shadows
thrown
by
the
trees
upon
the
ground
looked
sepulchral
and
from
being
so
still
he
softly
the
door
he
resolved
to
run
away
in
the
early
go
to
that
great
city
of
london
with
the
first
ray
of
light
that
struggled
through
the
crevices
in
the
shutters
oliver
arose
and
again
unbarred
the
door
one
timid
look
around
pause
of
hesitation
had
closed
it
behind
him
and
was
in
the
open
street
he
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
uncertain
whither
to
fly
he
remembered
to
have
seen
the
wagons
as
they
went
out
toiling
up
the
hill
he
took
the
same
route
and
arriving
at
a
footpath
across
the
fields
which
he
knew
led
out
again
into
the
road
struck
into
it
and
walked
quickly
on
he
was
then
only
ten
years
old
oliver
falls
from
bad
to
it
was
seventy
miles
to
london
and
the
poor
boy
made
his
way
thither
only
with
great
difficulty
begging
was
not
allowed
in
many
of
the
villages
and
nearly
everybody
viewed
him
with
doubt
or
else
shut
the
door
in
his
face
early
on
the
seventh
morning
of
his
flight
oliver
limped
slowly
into
the
little
town
of
barnet
near
the
outskirts
of
london
the
were
closed
the
street
was
empty
and
the
boy
sank
down
with
bleeding
feet
and
covered
with
dust
upon
a
by
degrees
the
shutters
were
opened
the
were
drawn
up
and
people
began
passing
to
and
fro
some
few
stopped
to
gaze
at
oliver
for
a
moment
or
two
or
turned
round
to
stare
at
him
as
they
hurried
by
but
none
relieved
him
or
troubled
themselves
to
inquire
how
he
came
there
he
had
no
heart
to
beg
and
there
he
sat
he
had
been
crouching
on
the
step
for
some
time
when
he
was
roused
by
observing
that
a
boy
who
had
passed
him
carelessly
some
minutes
before
had
returned
and
was
now
surveying
him
most
earnestly
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
he
took
little
heed
of
this
at
first
but
the
boy
remained
in
the
same
attitude
of
close
observation
so
long
that
oliver
raised
his
head
and
returned
his
steady
look
upon
this
the
boy
crossed
over
and
walking
close
up
to
oliver
said
hullo
my
covey
the
row
the
boy
who
addressed
this
inquiry
was
about
his
own
age
but
one
of
the
fellows
oliver
had
ever
seen
he
was
a
boy
enough
and
as
dirty
as
one
would
wish
to
see
but
he
had
about
him
all
the
airs
and
manners
of
a
man
he
was
short
of
his
age
with
rather
bow
legs
and
little
sharp
ugly
eyes
he
wore
a
coat
which
reached
nearly
to
his
heels
he
had
turned
the
cuffs
back
up
his
arm
to
get
his
hands
out
of
the
sleeves
apparently
with
the
ultimate
view
of
thrusting
them
into
the
pockets
of
his
corduroy
trousers
for
there
he
kept
them
he
was
altogether
as
swaggering
a
young
gentleman
as
ever
stood
four
feet
six
or
something
less
in
his
shoes
hullo
my
covey
the
row
said
this
strange
young
gentleman
to
oliver
i
am
very
hungry
and
tired
replied
oliver
the
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
i
have
walked
a
long
way
i
have
been
walking
these
seven
days
the
boy
looked
at
him
narrowly
and
asked
him
some
questions
he
took
oliver
for
a
vagrant
or
worse
but
led
him
into
a
small
tavern
and
gave
him
a
feast
of
ham
and
bread
and
oliver
falling
to
at
his
new
bidding
made
a
long
and
hearty
meal
during
the
progress
of
which
the
strange
boy
eyed
him
from
time
to
time
with
great
attention
going
to
london
said
the
strange
boy
when
oliver
had
at
length
concluded
yes
got
any
lodgings
no
money
no
the
strange
boy
whistled
and
put
his
arms
into
his
pockets
as
far
as
the
big
would
let
them
go
do
you
live
in
london
asked
oliver
yes
i
do
when
at
home
replied
the
strange
boy
want
to
go
along
with
me
i
know
an
old
as
lives
there
give
you
lodgings
for
nothink
the
unexpected
offer
was
too
tempting
to
be
resisted
especially
when
oliver
was
told
that
the
old
gentleman
would
doubtless
get
him
a
good
place
without
loss
of
time
this
led
to
a
more
friendly
and
confidential
chat
in
which
oliver
learned
that
his
new
name
was
jack
dawkins
commonly
called
the
artful
dodger
as
dawkins
objected
to
entering
london
before
nightfall
it
was
nearly
eleven
before
he
piloted
oliver
down
some
of
the
worst
streets
of
the
worst
section
finally
they
entered
a
tumbledown
building
and
groped
their
way
up
a
rickety
stairway
then
dawkins
threw
open
the
door
of
a
back
room
and
drew
oliver
in
after
him
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
room
were
perfectly
black
with
age
and
dirt
there
was
a
deal
table
before
the
fire
upon
which
were
a
candle
stuck
in
a
bottle
some
pewter
pots
bread
and
butter
several
rough
beds
were
huddled
side
by
side
upon
the
floor
seated
around
the
table
were
four
or
five
boys
none
older
than
the
dodger
smoking
long
clay
pipes
and
drinking
spirits
with
the
air
of
men
but
the
chief
figure
was
an
old
shrivelled
jew
whose
villanous
face
was
offset
by
a
mass
of
matted
red
hair
he
was
dressed
in
a
greasy
flannel
gown
and
was
busily
at
work
frying
sausages
over
a
fire
the
boys
crowded
around
dawkins
as
he
whispered
a
few
words
in
the
ear
of
the
jew
then
they
all
turned
as
did
the
jew
and
grinned
at
oliver
this
is
him
fagin
said
jack
dawkins
my
friend
oliver
twist
the
jew
made
a
low
bow
to
oliver
took
him
by
the
hand
and
hoped
he
should
have
the
honor
of
his
intimate
acquaintance
upon
this
the
young
gentlemen
with
the
pipes
came
round
him
and
shook
both
his
hands
very
the
one
in
which
he
held
his
little
bundle
one
young
gentleman
was
very
anxious
to
hang
up
his
cap
for
him
and
another
was
so
obliging
as
to
put
his
hands
in
pockets
in
order
that
as
he
was
very
tired
he
might
not
have
the
trouble
of
emptying
them
himself
when
he
went
to
bed
we
are
very
glad
to
see
you
said
the
jew
dodger
take
off
the
sausages
and
draw
a
tub
near
the
fire
for
oliver
oliver
ate
his
share
and
the
jew
then
mixed
him
a
glass
of
hot
gin
and
water
telling
him
he
must
drink
it
off
directly
because
another
gentleman
wanted
the
tumbler
oliver
did
as
he
was
desired
immediately
afterwards
he
felt
himself
gently
lifted
on
to
one
of
the
sacks
and
then
he
sank
into
a
deep
sleep
the
next
morning
oliver
watched
the
jew
dawkins
and
charley
bates
another
of
the
boys
play
a
curious
game
the
old
man
would
place
a
purse
and
other
valuables
in
his
pockets
whereupon
the
boys
would
try
to
slip
them
out
without
his
knowledge
oliver
understand
in
the
least
what
it
was
all
about
even
when
fagin
gave
him
some
lessons
in
the
same
game
but
he
was
to
learn
with
a
shock
a
few
days
later
when
bates
and
dawkins
took
him
with
them
for
a
walk
about
town
they
were
just
emerging
from
a
narrow
court
not
far
from
the
open
square
in
clerkenwell
when
the
dodger
made
a
sudden
stop
and
laying
his
finger
on
his
lip
drew
his
companions
back
again
with
the
greatest
caution
the
matter
demanded
oliver
hush
replied
the
dodger
do
you
see
that
old
cove
at
the
the
gentleman
over
the
way
said
oliver
yes
i
see
him
do
said
the
dodger
a
prime
plant
observed
master
charley
bates
oliver
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
surprise
but
he
was
not
permitted
to
make
any
inquiries
for
the
two
boys
walked
stealthily
across
the
road
and
slunk
close
behind
the
old
gentleman
oliver
walked
a
few
paces
after
them
and
not
knowing
whether
to
advance
or
retire
stood
looking
on
in
silent
amazement
the
gentleman
was
a
very
person
who
had
taken
up
a
book
from
the
stall
and
was
reading
away
as
hard
as
if
he
were
in
his
own
study
what
was
horror
and
alarm
as
he
stood
a
few
paces
off
looking
on
with
his
eyelids
as
wide
open
as
they
would
possibly
go
to
see
the
dodger
plunge
his
hand
into
the
pocket
and
draw
from
thence
a
handkerchief
to
see
him
hand
the
same
to
charley
bates
and
finally
to
behold
them
both
running
away
round
the
corner
at
full
speed
oliver
saw
in
a
flash
that
they
were
pickpockets
and
that
he
would
be
classed
among
them
he
turned
to
worst
possible
thing
to
just
then
the
gentleman
missed
his
handkerchief
and
glanced
around
in
time
to
see
oliver
scudding
away
for
dear
life
and
shouting
stop
thief
made
off
after
him
book
in
hand
he
was
not
alone
in
the
cry
for
bates
and
dawkins
willing
to
divert
attention
from
themselves
also
shouted
stop
thief
and
joined
in
the
pursuit
like
good
citizens
stop
thief
stop
thief
there
is
a
magic
in
the
sound
the
tradesman
leaves
his
counter
and
the
carman
his
wagon
the
butcher
throws
down
his
tray
the
baker
his
basket
the
milkman
his
pail
the
his
parcels
the
his
marbles
away
they
run
tearing
yelling
screaming
and
knocking
down
the
passengers
as
they
turn
the
corners
stop
thief
stop
thief
the
cry
is
taken
up
by
a
hundred
voices
and
the
crowd
accumulates
at
every
turning
away
they
fly
splashing
through
the
mud
and
rattling
along
the
pavements
up
go
the
windows
out
run
the
people
and
lend
fresh
vigor
to
the
cry
stop
thief
stop
thief
stopped
at
last
a
blow
laid
oliver
upon
the
pavement
then
a
policeman
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
he
was
hustled
off
for
trial
before
a
magistrate
the
magistrate
was
a
surly
boor
who
was
in
the
habit
of
committing
prisoners
to
jail
with
the
merest
pretence
of
a
trial
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
decide
that
oliver
was
a
hardened
criminal
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
the
kindly
old
gentleman
whose
pocket
had
been
picked
and
the
boy
was
in
fact
being
carried
away
in
a
fainting
condition
when
the
bookseller
whose
shop
had
been
the
scene
of
action
and
who
had
witnessed
the
whole
thing
rushed
in
and
declared
innocence
the
poor
child
was
thereupon
released
and
the
old
brownlow
by
so
sorry
for
him
and
so
taken
by
his
frank
face
that
he
took
him
to
his
own
home
and
nursed
him
through
a
severe
illness
the
result
of
all
his
early
privations
and
recent
trouble
brownlow
even
thought
of
adopting
him
and
as
soon
as
he
was
well
enough
let
him
have
books
to
read
out
of
his
own
library
greatly
to
the
eager
delight
illustration
sikes
had
him
by
the
collar
it
did
indeed
seem
as
though
the
sky
had
cleared
for
the
boy
but
instead
still
darker
days
were
threatening
fagin
the
jew
heard
of
escape
with
fear
and
anger
he
knew
that
it
would
never
do
for
the
boy
to
tell
what
he
knew
about
the
den
their
one
chance
of
safety
lay
in
seizing
him
again
and
making
him
a
thief
like
themselves
so
that
his
mouth
would
be
closed
so
fagin
called
to
his
aid
a
burglar
a
big
brutal
fellow
named
bill
sikes
who
always
went
around
with
a
knotted
stick
and
a
surly
dog
nancy
a
poor
girl
of
the
streets
was
also
put
upon
the
search
and
soon
their
united
efforts
were
successful
one
day
after
oliver
had
begun
to
grow
strong
he
was
sent
by
brownlow
on
an
errand
to
a
bookshop
he
was
well
dressed
in
a
new
suit
and
had
some
books
and
a
note
of
it
was
not
far
but
he
accidentally
turned
down
a
that
was
not
exactly
in
his
way
he
started
to
turn
back
when
he
heard
a
voice
screaming
oh
my
dear
brother
and
he
had
hardly
looked
up
to
see
what
the
matter
was
when
he
was
stopped
by
having
a
pair
of

young

embraced

and
who
had
a
little
basket
and
a

these
words
the
man
tore
the
volumes
from
his
grasp
and
struck
him
on
the
head
right
cried
a
from
a
garret
window
the
only
way
of
bringing
him
to
his
senses
to
be
sure
cried
a
carpenter
casting
an
approving
look
at
the
garret
window
do
him
good
said
the
woman
and
he
shall
have
it
too
rejoined
the
man
administering
another
blow
and
seizing
oliver
by
the
collar
come
on
you
young
villain
here
mind
him
boy
mind
him
weak
from
his
recent
illness
and
with
no
one
in
the
idle
crowd
to
befriend
him
poor
oliver
could
only
suffer
himself
to
be
led
away
sobbing
bill
sikes
saw
his
advantage
and
pushed
him
rapidly
down
the
street
then
turning
to
oliver
he
commanded
him
to
take
hold
of
hand
do
you
hear
growled
sikes
as
oliver
hesitated
and
looked
round
they
were
in
a
dark
corner
quite
out
of
the
track
of
passengers
oliver
saw
but
too
plainly
that
resistance
would
be
of
no
avail
he
held
out
his
hand
which
nancy
clasped
tight
in
hers
give
me
the
other
said
sikes
here
the
dog
looked
up
and
growled
see
here
boy
said
sikes
putting
his
other
hand
to
throat
if
he
speaks
ever
so
soft
a
word
hold
him
mind
the
dog
growled
again
and
licking
his
lips
eyed
oliver
as
if
he
were
anxious
to
attach
himself
to
his
windpipe
without
delay
and
in
this
fashion
oliver
saw
with
unspeakable
horror
that
he
was
being
taken
back
to
the
jew
what
would
the
trusting
brownlow
think
of
him
what
indeed
the
hot
tears
blinded
eyes
at
the
bare
thought
presently
they
arrived
before
the
house
but
found
it
perfectly
dark
have
a
glim
said
sikes
or
we
shall
go
breaking
our
necks
or
treading
on
the
dog
look
after
your
legs
if
you
do
all
stand
still
a
moment
and
get
you
one
replied
a
voice
the
footsteps
of
the
speaker
were
heard
and
in
another
minute
the
form
of
john
dawkins
otherwise
the
artful
dodger
appeared
he
bore
in
his
right
hand
a
tallow
candle
stuck
in
the
end
of
a
cleft
stick
the
young
gentleman
did
not
stop
to
bestow
any
other
mark
of
recognition
upon
oliver
than
a
humorous
grin
but
turning
away
beckoned
the
visitors
to
follow
him
as
they
entered
the
low
dingy
room
they
were
received
with
a
shout
of
laughter
oh
my
wig
my
wig
cried
charley
bates
here
he
is
oh
cry
here
he
is
oh
fagin
look
at
him
fagin
do
look
at
him
i
bear
it
it
is
such
a
jolly
game
i
bear
it
hold
me
somebody
while
i
laugh
it
out
with
this
master
bates
laid
himself
flat
on
the
floor
and
kicked
convulsively
for
five
minutes
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
then
jumping
to
his
feet
he
snatched
the
cleft
stick
from
the
dodger
and
advancing
to
oliver
viewed
him
round
and
round
while
the
jew
taking
off
his
nightcap
made
a
great
number
of
low
bows
to
the
bewildered
boy
the
artful
meantime
who
seldom
gave
way
to
merriment
when
it
interfered
with
business
rifled
pockets
thoroughly
look
at
his
togs
fagin
said
charley
putting
the
light
so
close
to
his
new
jacket
as
nearly
to
set
him
on
fire
look
at
his
togs
cloth
and
the
cut
oh
my
eye
what
a
game
and
his
books
too
nothing
but
a
gentleman
fagin
delighted
to
see
you
looking
so
well
my
dear
said
the
jew
bowing
with
mock
humility
the
artful
shall
give
you
another
suit
my
dear
for
fear
you
should
spoil
that
sunday
one
why
you
write
my
dear
and
say
you
were
coming
have
got
something
warm
for
supper
at
this
master
bates
roared
again
so
loud
that
fagin
himself
relaxed
and
even
the
dodger
smiled
but
as
the
artful
drew
forth
the
note
at
that
instant
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
sally
or
the
discovery
awakened
his
merriment
hallo
that
inquired
sikes
stepping
forward
as
the
jew
seized
the
note
mine
fagin
no
no
my
dear
said
the
jew
mine
bill
mine
you
shall
have
the
books
they
belong
to
mr
brownlow
cried
oliver
wringing
his
hands
oh
pray
send
them
back
think
i
stole
them
the
right
replied
fagin
with
a
sly
wink
he
think
stole
them
oliver
saw
by
his
look
that
all
chance
of
rescue
was
gone
and
shrieking
wildly
he
made
a
dash
for
the
door
but
the
dog
arrested
him
with
a
fierce
growl
while
a
blow
laid
him
upon
the
floor
for
several
days
fagin
kept
him
hid
close
for
fear
of
searching
parties
then
resolving
to
get
the
boy
deeply
into
crime
as
soon
as
possible
he
forced
him
to
accompany
bill
sikes
upon
a
expedition
accordingly
one
raw
evening
they
set
sikes
and
another
burglar
toby
ruffians
threatening
to
shoot
the
boy
if
he
so
much
as
uttered
one
word
on
account
of
his
small
size
he
was
chosen
to
creep
through
a
little
window
of
the
house
which
was
to
be
robbed
the
opening
was
about
five
feet
from
the
ground
and
so
small
that
the
inmates
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
defend
it
securely
but
it
was
large
enough
to
admit
a
boy
of
size
nevertheless
now
listen
you
young
limb
whispered
sikes
drawing
a
from
his
pocket
and
throwing
the
glare
full
in
face
going
to
put
you
through
there
take
this
light
and
go
softly
up
the
steps
straight
afore
you
and
along
the
little
hall
to
the
street
door
unfasten
it
and
let
us
in
so
saying
the
burglar
boosted
oliver
up
on
his
back
and
put
him
through
the
window
you
see
the
stairs
you
oliver
more
dead
than
alive
gasped
out
yes
sikes
pointed
the
pistol
at
him
and
advised
him
to
take
notice
that
he
was
within
shot
all
the
way
nevertheless
the
boy
had
firmly
resolved
that
whether
he
died
in
the
attempt
or
not
he
would
make
one
effort
to
dart
upstairs
from
the
hall
and
alarm
the
family
filled
with
this
idea
he
advanced
at
once
but
stealthily
come
back
suddenly
cried
sikes
aloud
back
back
scared
by
the
sudden
breaking
of
the
dead
stillness
of
the
place
and
by
a
loud
cry
which
followed
it
oliver
let
his
lantern
fall
and
knew
not
whether
to
advance
or
fly
the
cry
was
light
vision
of
two
terrified
men
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
swam
before
his
loud
crash
somewhere
but
where
he
knew
not
he
staggered
back
sikes
had
disappeared
for
an
instant
but
he
was
up
again
and
had
him
by
the
collar
before
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
he
fired
his
own
pistol
after
the
men
who
were
already
retreating
and
dragged
the
boy
up
clasp
your
arm
tighter
said
sikes
as
he
drew
him
through
the
window
give
me
a
shawl
here
hit
him
quick
how
the
boy
bleeds
then
came
the
loud
ringing
of
a
bell
mingled
with
the
noise
of
firearms
and
the
shouts
of
men
and
the
sensation
of
being
carried
over
uneven
ground
at
a
rapid
pace
and
then
the
noises
grew
confused
in
the
distance
a
cold
deadly
feeling
crept
over
the
heart
and
he
saw
or
heard
no
more
oliver
makes
his
way
into
good
bill
sikes
and
toby
crackit
were
so
hard
pressed
that
they
were
soon
forced
to
leave
oliver
lying
in
a
ditch
the
hue
and
cry
passed
him
to
one
side
leaving
him
alone
and
unconscious
through
the
long
cold
night
morning
drew
on
apace
the
rain
came
down
thick
and
fast
but
oliver
felt
it
not
as
it
beat
against
him
at
length
a
low
cry
of
pain
broke
the
stillness
and
uttering
it
the
boy
awoke
his
left
arm
rudely
bandaged
in
a
shawl
hung
heavy
and
useless
at
his
side
and
the
bandage
was
saturated
with
blood
he
was
so
weak
that
he
could
scarcely
raise
himself
into
a
sitting
posture
when
he
had
at
last
done
so
he
looked
feebly
round
for
help
and
groaned
with
agony
trembling
in
every
joint
from
cold
and
exhaustion
he
made
an
effort
to
stand
upright
but
shuddering
from
head
to
foot
fell
prostrate
on
the
ground
after
a
short
return
of
the
stupor
in
which
he
had
been
so
long
plunged
oliver
got
upon
his
feet
and
essayed
to
walk
his
head
was
dizzy
and
he
staggered
to
and
fro
like
a
drunken
man
but
he
kept
up
nevertheless
and
with
his
head
drooping
languidly
on
his
breast
went
stumbling
onward
he
knew
not
whither
the
rain
was
falling
heavily
now
but
the
cold
drops
roused
him
like
whiplashes
he
pressed
forward
with
the
last
ounce
of
his
strength
feeling
that
if
he
stopped
he
must
surely
die
and
by
chance
reached
the
same
house
of
the
attempted
burglary
he
knew
the
place
at
once
but
his
strength
was
at
an
end
and
he
sank
exhausted
on
the
little
portico
by
the
door
the
servants
who
presently
opened
the
door
were
immensely
surprised
to
find
the
wounded
boy
and
two
of
them
were
certain
he
was
the
same
who
had
broken
into
the
house
but
in
his
pitiful
condition
they
put
him
to
bed
and
sent
for
a
surgeon
a
very
lady
maylie
and
her
adopted
niece
rose
lived
here
they
cared
for
oliver
tenderly
for
like
his
lost
friend
brownlow
they
were
greatly
taken
by
his
open
face
and
believed
in
him
despite
the
strange
story
which
he
presently
found
strength
to
tell
with
the
aid
of
their
friend
the
surgeon
they
convinced
the
servants
that
a
mistake
had
been
made
and
so
oliver
was
not
taken
to
jail
instead
he
was
received
into
this
kindly
home
and
it
really
seemed
that
now
his
dark
days
were
over
at
last
oliver
resumed
the
study
of
his
beloved
books
which
he
had
begun
with
brownlow
but
he
also
spent
much
time
in
the
open
fields
and
soon
grew
sturdy
and
strong
with
the
brown
look
of
health
in
his
face
between
him
and
rose
maylie
a
tender
affection
sprang
up
he
was
in
fact
her
devoted
knight
one
beautiful
evening
when
the
first
shades
of
twilight
were
beginning
to
settle
upon
the
earth
oliver
sat
at
his
window
intent
upon
his
books
he
had
been
poring
over
them
for
some
time
and
as
the
day
had
been
uncommonly
sultry
and
he
had
exerted
himself
a
great
deal
by
slow
degrees
he
fell
asleep
there
is
a
kind
of
sleep
that
steals
upon
us
sometimes
which
while
it
holds
the
body
prisoner
does
not
free
the
mind
from
a
sense
of
things
about
it
or
enable
it
to
ramble
at
its
pleasure
oliver
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
was
in
his
own
little
room
that
his
books
were
lying
on
the
table
before
him
that
the
sweet
air
was
stirring
among
the
creeping
plants
outside
and
yet
he
was
asleep
suddenly
the
scene
changed
the
air
became
close
and
confined
and
he
thought
with
a
glow
of
terror
that
he
was
in
the
house
again
there
sat
the
hideous
old
man
in
his
accustomed
corner
pointing
at
him
and
whispering
to
another
man
with
his
face
averted
who
sat
beside
him
hush
my
dear
he
thought
he
heard
the
jew
say
it
is
he
sure
enough
come
away
he
the
other
man
seemed
to
answer
could
i
mistake
him
think
you
if
a
crowd
of
ghosts
were
to
put
themselves
into
his
exact
shape
and
he
stood
among
them
there
is
something
that
would
tell
me
how
to
point
him
out
the
man
seemed
to
say
this
with
such
dreadful
hatred
that
oliver
awoke
with
the
fear
and
started
up
good
heaven
what
was
that
which
sent
the
blood
tingling
to
his
heart
and
deprived
him
of
his
voice
and
of
power
to
move
the
before
close
that
he
could
have
almost
touched
him
before
he
started
his
eyes
peering
into
the
room
and
meeting
stood
the
jew
and
beside
him
were
the
scowling
features
of
a
dark
man
whom
oliver
had
seen
only
once
but
had
instinctively
learned
to
fear
it
was
but
an
instant
a
glance
a
flash
before
his
eyes
and
they
were
gone
but
they
had
recognized
him
and
he
them
he
knew
they
were
once
again
lying
in
wait
to
seize
him
and
that
his
days
of
peace
and
happiness
were
numbered
voice
and
motion
came
back
to
him
with
the
fear
and
leaping
from
the
window
he
called
loudly
for
help
nevertheless
no
trace
of
fagin
or
the
stranger
could
be
found
though
the
search
was
pursued
with
haste
and
friends
were
forced
to
believe
that
it
had
been
only
a
feverish
dream
but
oliver
had
not
been
mistaken
the
two
figures
at
the
window
were
really
fagin
and
a
man
named
monks
who
for
some
mysterious
reason
had
been
the
most
vindictive
enemy
it
was
he
who
had
found
oliver
again
and
reported
the
fact
to
fagin
and
together
they
laid
cunning
plans
to
get
him
once
more
into
their
clutches
at
this
critical
moment
in
welfare
an
unexpected
friend
to
him
appeared
in
the
person
of
nancy
the
she
had
bitterly
repented
her
share
in
kidnapping
him
from
brownlow
and
now
longed
for
a
chance
to
do
him
some
service
the
chance
offered
when
she
happened
to
overhear
the
interview
between
monks
and
the
jew
she
could
not
understand
all
she
heard
but
she
realized
that
the
boy
was
in
great
danger
unless
she
acted
at
once
hastening
to
the
home
of
rose
maylie
nancy
contrived
to
see
her
alone
and
repeated
word
for
word
the
conversation
she
had
overheard
from
the
dark
threats
of
this
man
monks
it
seemed
that
very
life
was
in
danger
because
of
some
secret
connected
with
his
birth
nancy
knew
that
it
meant
her
own
death
also
if
her
visit
to
miss
maylie
became
known
but
she
could
not
remain
silent
miss
maylie
listened
to
her
story
with
horror
and
amazement
she
realized
that
something
must
be
done
quickly
but
did
not
know
to
whom
to
turn
in
her
perplexity
oliver
made
a
discovery
of
great
value
to
both
of
them
on
the
very
day
of
hurried
visit
and
no
less
hurried
departure
he
came
running
in
his
eyes
all
aglow
with
excitement
i
have
seen
him
he
exclaimed
excitedly
i
knew
that
if
i
kept
on
looking
i
should
find
him
again
one
day
i
mean
the
gentleman
who
was
so
good
to
brownlow
where
asked
rose
getting
out
of
a
coach
replied
oliver
i
have
the
chance
to
speak
to
him
but
i
took
the
number
of
the
house
he
went
into
here
it
is
and
he
flourished
a
scrap
of
paper
delightedly
oh
let
us
go
there
at
once
rose
read
the
address
eagerly
and
decided
to
put
the
discovery
to
account
not
alone
would
oliver
be
gratified
but
brownlow
might
be
the
very
friend
they
needed
at
this
momentous
time
quick
she
said
tell
them
to
fetch
a
and
be
ready
to
go
with
me
i
will
take
you
there
directly
without
a
loss
of
time
i
will
only
tell
my
aunt
that
we
are
going
out
for
an
hour
and
be
ready
as
soon
as
you
are
oliver
needed
no
prompting
to
hasten
and
in
little
more
than
five
minutes
they
were
on
their
way
when
they
arrived
at
the
address
noted
rose
left
oliver
in
the
coach
under
pretence
of
preparing
his
friend
to
receive
him
and
sending
up
her
card
by
the
servant
requested
to
see
brownlow
on
very
pressing
business
the
servant
soon
returned
to
beg
that
she
would
walk
upstairs
and
following
him
into
an
upper
room
miss
maylie
was
presented
to
an
elderly
gentleman
of
benevolent
appearance
in
a
coat
dear
me
said
the
gentleman
hastily
rising
with
great
politeness
i
beg
your
pardon
young
imagined
it
was
some
importunate
person
beg
you
will
excuse
me
be
seated
pray
brownlow
i
believe
sir
said
rose
that
is
my
name
i
shall
surprise
you
very
much
i
have
no
doubt
said
rose
naturally
embarrassed
but
you
once
showed
great
kindness
to
a
very
dear
young
friend
of
mine
and
i
am
sure
you
will
take
an
interest
in
hearing
of
him
again
indeed
said
brownlow
oliver
twist
as
you
knew
him
said
rose
brownlow
was
naturally
surprised
but
said
nothing
for
a
few
moments
then
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
he
remarked
quietly
but
earnestly
believe
me
my
dear
young
lady
if
you
can
tell
me
good
news
of
that
child
or
lift
the
shadow
which
rests
upon
his
name
you
will
be
doing
me
the
greatest
service
rose
at
once
related
in
a
few
words
all
that
had
befallen
oliver
since
leaving
house
how
he
had
searched
for
him
but
had
only
seen
him
that
very
day
and
finally
of
the
new
danger
which
threatened
the
boy
you
may
believe
that
brownlow
sat
very
straight
upon
the
extreme
edge
of
his
chair
during
the
latter
part
of
this
recital
the
poor
lad
he
exclaimed
but
why
have
you
not
brought
him
with
you
i
wished
to
talk
with
you
alone
about
this
plot
he
does
not
know
of
it
but
i
believe
he
is
now
waiting
in
the
coach
at
the
door
at
this
door
cried
brownlow
and
without
another
word
he
rushed
from
the
room
in
less
than
a
minute
he
was
back
again
lugging
oliver
in
bodily
and
both
and
shedding
the
same
time
then
after
the
jolliest
of
visits
rose
and
oliver
took
their
leave
for
the
present
but
not
before
brownlow
had
told
rose
privately
that
he
would
turn
his
whole
attention
to
the
new
conspiracy
nancy
had
promised
to
meet
rose
on
london
bridge
a
few
nights
later
and
brownlow
determined
to
be
there
also
in
the
meantime
he
made
other
plans
for
capturing
the
rogues
the
end
of
evil
now
unbeknown
to
nancy
fagin
the
jew
had
become
suspicious
of
her
and
had
set
a
spy
upon
her
heels
this
spy
was
none
other
than
noah
claypole
the
apprentice
whom
oliver
had
so
soundly
thrashed
noah
had
lately
come
to
london
to
try
his
fortune
in
any
underhand
way
that
might
arise
the
jew
was
always
on
the
lookout
for
just
such
fellows
as
he
so
they
soon
struck
a
bargain
on
the
night
when
nancy
set
forth
to
keep
her
appointment
on
the
bridge
noah
was
kept
busy
darting
from
pillar
to
post
but
all
the
time
keeping
her
in
sight
when
she
met
rose
and
brownlow
the
spy
quickly
slunk
behind
an
abutment
where
he
could
hear
every
word
of
what
she
said
and
you
may
be
sure
he
lost
no
time
in
taking
his
story
back
to
the
jew
bill
sikes
had
just
returned
in
the
early
morning
from
a
jaunt
and
was
as
usual
in
an
ugly
mood
a
word
from
the
jew
about
defection
set
his
brain
on
fire
with
hatred
against
the
girl
he
hastened
to
her
room
and
disregarding
all
her
appeals
for
mercy
struck
her
lifeless
to
the
floor
this
murder
proved
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
all
the
gang
brownlow
had
already
set
the
police
to
work
and
now
offered
a
large
personal
reward
for
arrest
the
murderer
was
tracked
in
and
about
the
city
for
several
days
until
he
finally
hung
himself
in
endeavoring
to
escape
from
the
roof
of
a
house
fagin
the
jew
was
captured
at
last
and
for
his
share
in
this
crime
and
his
other
wickednesses
was
condemned
to
death
a
great
popular
clamor
had
been
aroused
against
him
and
he
was
to
be
hung
without
delay
in
the
hope
that
the
jew
would
throw
some
light
upon
monks
and
some
secret
papers
which
brownlow
had
traced
that
gentleman
took
oliver
with
him
to
the
prison
to
see
fagin
on
his
last
night
upon
earth
is
the
young
gentleman
to
come
too
sir
said
the
man
whose
duty
it
was
to
conduct
them
not
a
sight
for
children
sir
it
is
not
indeed
my
friend
rejoined
brownlow
but
my
business
with
this
man
is
intimately
connected
with
him
and
as
this
child
has
seen
him
in
the
full
career
of
his
success
and
villany
i
think
it
at
the
cost
of
some
pain
and
he
should
see
him
now
these
few
words
had
been
said
apart
so
as
to
be
inaudible
to
oliver
the
man
touched
his
hat
and
glancing
at
oliver
with
some
curiosity
opened
another
gate
opposite
to
that
by
which
they
had
entered
and
led
them
on
through
dark
and
winding
ways
to
the
cell
the
condemned
criminal
was
seated
on
his
bed
rocking
himself
from
side
to
side
with
a
countenance
more
like
that
of
a
snared
beast
than
the
face
of
a
man
his
mind
was
evidently
wandering
to
his
old
life
for
he
continued
to
mutter
without
appearing
conscious
of
their
presence
otherwise
than
as
a
part
of
his
vision
good
boy
done
mumbled
oliver
too
ha
ha
ha
oliver
the
gentleman
that
boy
away
to
bed
the
jailer
took
the
disengaged
hand
of
oliver
and
whispering
to
him
not
to
be
alarmed
looked
on
without
speaking
take
him
away
to
bed
cried
the
jew
do
you
hear
me
some
of
you
he
has
been
the
cause
of
all
this
fagin
said
the
jailer
me
cried
the
jew
falling
instantly
into
the
attitude
of
listening
he
had
assumed
upon
his
trial
an
old
man
my
lord
a
very
old
old
man
here
said
the
turnkey
laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
to
keep
him
down
somebody
wants
to
see
you
to
ask
you
some
questions
i
suppose
fagin
fagin
are
you
a
man
i
be
one
long
replied
the
jew
looking
up
with
a
face
retaining
no
human
expression
but
rage
and
terror
strike
them
all
dead
what
right
have
they
to
butcher
me
as
he
spoke
he
caught
sight
of
oliver
and
brownlow
shrinking
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
seat
he
demanded
to
know
what
they
wanted
there
steady
said
the
turnkey
still
holding
him
down
now
sir
tell
him
what
you
if
you
please
for
he
grows
worse
as
the
time
gets
on
you
have
some
papers
said
brownlow
advancing
which
were
placed
in
your
hands
for
better
security
by
a
man
called
monks
all
a
lie
together
replied
the
jew
i
one
for
the
love
of
god
said
brownlow
solemnly
do
not
tell
a
lie
now
upon
the
very
verge
of
death
but
tell
me
where
they
are
you
know
that
sikes
is
dead
and
that
there
is
no
hope
of
any
farther
gain
where
are
those
papers
oliver
cried
the
jew
beckoning
to
him
here
here
let
me
whisper
to
you
i
am
not
afraid
said
oliver
in
a
firm
voice
as
he
relinquished
hand
the
papers
said
the
jew
drawing
him
towards
him
are
in
a
canvas
bag
in
a
hole
a
little
way
up
the
chimney
in
the
top
front
room
i
want
to
talk
to
you
my
dear
i
want
to
talk
to
you
yes
yes
returned
oliver
let
me
say
a
prayer
do
let
me
say
one
prayer
say
only
one
upon
your
knees
with
me
and
we
will
talk
till
morning
outside
outside
replied
the
jew
pushing
the
boy
before
him
towards
the
door
and
looking
vacantly
over
his
head
say
gone
to
believe
you
can
get
me
out
if
you
take
me
so
now
then
now
then
oh
god
forgive
this
wretched
man
cried
the
boy
with
a
burst
of
tears
right
right
said
the
jew
help
us
on
this
door
first
if
i
shake
and
tremble
as
we
pass
the
gallows
you
mind
but
hurry
on
now
now
now
have
you
nothing
else
to
ask
him
sir
inquired
the
turnkey
no
other
question
replied
brownlow
if
i
hoped
we
could
recall
him
to
a
sense
of
his
nothing
will
do
that
sir
replied
the
man
shaking
his
head
you
had
better
leave
him
the
door
of
the
cell
opened
and
the
attendants
returned
press
on
press
on
cried
the
jew
softly
but
not
so
slow
faster
faster
the
men
laid
hands
upon
him
and
disengaging
oliver
from
his
grasp
held
him
back
he
struggled
with
the
power
of
desperation
for
an
instant
and
then
sent
up
cry
upon
cry
that
penetrated
even
those
massive
walls
and
rang
in
their
ears
until
they
reached
the
open
yard
and
oliver
the
last
of
the
man
from
whose
clutches
he
had
so
narrowly
escaped
noah
claypole
turned
evidence
at
this
time
and
thus
escaped
the
law
dawkins
the
artful
dodger
had
been
caught
picking
pockets
and
was
transported
from
the
country
charley
bates
was
so
unnerved
by
the
fate
of
nancy
and
the
swift
punishment
of
his
companions
that
he
reformed
and
became
an
honest
young
man
and
finally
what
of
monks
he
was
shadowed
and
seized
by
agents
and
proved
to
be
none
other
than
the
of
oliver
twist
their
father
was
dead
but
he
had
left
a
will
providing
for
the
boy
also
and
it
was
on
this
account
that
monks
had
wished
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
and
had
employed
fagin
in
trying
to
ruin
the
lad
the
papers
were
found
as
the
jew
had
indicated
and
they
not
only
cleared
up
past
history
but
proved
his
right
to
a
share
in
a
considerable
family
estate
brownlow
had
known
father
in
their
early
days
and
now
used
this
knowledge
to
wring
a
full
confession
from
the
villain
another
strange
secret
came
to
light
also
at
this
time
rose
maylie
was
found
to
be
a
younger
sister
of
dead
mother
and
therefore
the
own
aunt
not
aunt
cried
oliver
when
he
heard
this
amazing
but
delightful
news
never
call
her
aunt
sister
my
own
dear
sister
that
something
taught
my
heart
to
love
so
dearly
from
the
first
rose
dear
darling
rose
and
the
two
orphans
no
longer
alone
but
united

who
had

seeking
his

this
advertisement
in
a

paper
seemed
a
is
provided
he
could
secure
the
position
referred
to
in
the
last
two
lines
it
is
true
the
salary
was
not
large
but
he
reflected
that
his
board
and
living
would
be
included
and
that
a
young
man
of
his
education
and
ability
would
be
bound
to
rise
he
even
fancied
himself
in
a
future
at
the
head
of
this
model
school
dotheboys

in
the
delightful
village
of
dotheboys
near

in

but
it
would
not
do
to
sit
dreaming
some
one
else
might
snap
up
this
golden
opportunity
nicholas
brushed
his
clothes
carefully
and
lost
no
time
in
calling
upon
squeers
at
the
tavern
called
the
head
appearance
was
not
prepossessing
he
had
but
one
eye
which
while
it
was
unquestionably
useful
was
decidedly
not
ornamental
being
of
a
greenish
gray
and
in
shape
resembling
the
of
a
the
blank
side
of
his
face
was
much
wrinkled
and
puckered
up
which
gave
him
a
very
sinister
appearance
especially
when
he
smiled
at
which
times
his
expression
bordered
closely
on
the
villanous
he
was
about
two
or
three
and
fifty
and
a
trifle
below
the
middle
size
and
he
wore
a
white
neckerchief
with
long
ends
and
a
suit
of
scholastic
black
squeers
was
standing
in
a
box
by
one
of
the
fireplaces
fitted
with
one
such
table
as
is
usually
seen
in
in
a
corner
of
the
seat
was
a
very
small
deal
trunk
tied
round
with
a
scanty
piece
of
cord
and
on
the
trunk
was
and
corduroy
trousers
dangling
in
the
diminutive
boy
with
his
shoulders
drawn
up
to
his
ears
and
his
hands
planted
on
his
knees
who
glanced
timidly
at
the
schoolmaster
from
time
to
time
with
evident
dread
presently
the
boy
chanced
to
give
a
violent
sneeze
hallo
sir
growled
the
schoolmaster
turning
round
that
sir
nothing
please
sir
replied
the
little
boy
nothing
sir
exclaimed
squeers
please
sir
i
sneezed
rejoined
the
boy
trembling
till
the
little
trunk
shook
under
him
oh
sneezed
did
you
retorted
squeers
then
what
did
you
say
for
sir
in
default
of
a
better
answer
to
this
question
the
little
boy
screwed
a
couple
of
knuckles
into
each
of
his
eyes
and
began
to
cry
wherefore
squeers
knocked
him
off
the
trunk
with
a
blow
on
one
side
of
his
face
and
knocked
him
on
again
with
a
blow
on
the
other
wait
till
i
get
you
down
to
yorkshire
my
young
gentleman
said
squeers
and
then
give
you
the
rest
will
you
hold
that
noise
sir
sobbed
the
little
boy
rubbing
his
face
very
hard
then
do
so
at
once
sir
said
squeers
do
you
hear
the
little
boy
rubbed
his
face
harder
as
if
to
keep
the
tears
back
and
beyond
alternately
sniffing
and
choking
gave
no
farther
vent
to
his
emotions
squeers
said
the
waiter
looking
in
at
this
juncture
a
gentleman
asking
for
you
at
the
bar
show
the
gentleman
in
richard
replied
squeers
in
a
soft
voice
put
your
handkerchief
in
your
pocket
you
little
scoundrel
the
schoolmaster
had
scarcely
uttered
these
words
in
a
fierce
whisper
when
the
stranger
entered
affecting
not
to
see
him
squeers
feigned
to
be
intent
upon
mending
a
pen
and
offering
benevolent
advice
to
his
youthful
pupil
my
dear
child
said
squeers
all
people
have
their
trials
this
early
trial
of
yours
that
is
fit
to
make
your
little
heart
burst
and
your
very
eyes
come
out
of
your
head
with
crying
what
is
it
nothing
less
than
nothing
you
are
leaving
your
friends
but
you
will
have
a
father
in
me
my
dear
and
a
mother
in
squeers
at
the
delightful
village
of
dotheboys
near
greta
bridge
in
yorkshire
where
youth
are
boarded
clothed
booked
washed
furnished
with
provided
with
all
squeers
i
believe
said
nicholas
nickleby
as
that
worthy
man
stopped
to
cough
the
same
sir
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
came
in
answer
to
an
advertisement
in
this
paper
said
nicholas
i
believe
you
desire
an
assistant
i
do
sir
rejoined
squeers
coolly
but
if
you
are
applying
for
the
place
you
think
too
young
i
hope
not
sir
and
i
have
a
fair
education
i
could
what
interrupted
the
schoolmaster
could
you
lick
the
boys
if
they
needed
it
i
do
not
usually
believe
in
that
sort
of
hesitated
nicholas
could
you
do
it
urged
squeers
i
they
needed
could
lick
anybody
in
your
school
smiled
nicholas
well
why
you
say
so
i
guess
i
had
better
take
you
got
to
leave
town
at
eight
morning
and
time
to
look
around
so
be
on
hand
sharp
nicholas
thanked
him
and
promised
to
be
on
hand
the
next
day
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
reached
the
tavern
a
little
in
advance
of
the
appointed
hour
he
found
squeers
sitting
at
breakfast
with
the
little
boy
before
noticed
and
four
others
who
had
turned
up
by
some
lucky
chance
since
the
interview
of
the
previous
day
ranged
in
a
row
on
the
opposite
seat
squeers
had
before
him
a
small
measure
of
coffee
a
plate
of
hot
toast
and
a
cold
round
of
beef
but
he
was
at
that
moment
intent
on
preparing
breakfast
for
the
little
boys
this
is
of
milk
is
it
waiter
said
he
looking
down
into
a
large
blue
mug
and
slanting
it
gently
so
as
to
get
an
accurate
view
of
the
quantity
of
liquid
contained
in
it
sir
replied
the
waiter
what
a
rare
article
milk
is
to
be
sure
in
london
said
squeers
with
a
sigh
just
fill
that
mug
up
with
lukewarm
water
william
will
you
to
the
wery
top
sir
inquired
the
waiter
why
the
milk
will
be
drownded
never
you
mind
that
replied
squeers
serve
it
right
for
being
so
dear
you
ordered
that
thick
bread
and
butter
for
three
did
you
coming
directly
sir
you
hurry
yourself
said
squeers
plenty
of
time
conquer
your
passions
boys
and
be
eager
after
vittles
as
he
uttered
this
moral
precept
squeers
took
a
large
bite
out
of
the
cold
beef
and
recognized
nicholas
sit
down
nickleby
said
squeers
here
we
are
a
breakfasting
you
see
nicholas
did
not
see
that
anybody
was
breakfasting
except
squeers
but
he
bowed
with
all
becoming
reverence
and
looked
as
cheerful
as
he
could
oh
the
milk
and
water
is
it
william
said
squeers
very
good
forget
the
bread
and
butter
presently
at
this
fresh
mention
of
the
bread
and
butter
the
five
little
boys
looked
very
eager
and
followed
the
waiter
out
with
their
eyes
meanwhile
squeers
tasted
the
milk
and
water
ah
said
that
gentleman
smacking
his
lips
richness
think
of
the
many
beggars
and
orphans
in
the
streets
that
would
be
glad
of
this
little
boys
a
shocking
thing
hunger
is
it
mr
nickleby
very
shocking
sir
said
nicholas
when
i
say
number
one
pursued
squeers
putting
the
mug
before
the
children
the
boy
on
the
left
hand
nearest
the
window
may
take
a
drink
and
when
i
say
number
two
the
boy
next
him
will
go
in
and
so
till
we
come
to
number
five
which
is
the
last
boy
are
you
ready
yes
sir
cried
all
the
little
boys
with
great
eagerness
right
said
squeers
calmly
getting
on
with
his
breakfast
keep
ready
till
i
tell
you
to
begin
subdue
your
appetites
my
dears
and
conquered
human
natur
this
is
the
way
we
inculcate
strength
of
mind
nickleby
said
the
schoolmaster
turning
to
nicholas
and
speaking
with
his
mouth
very
full
of
beef
and
toast
nicholas
murmured
knew
not
reply
and
the
little
boys
dividing
their
gaze
between
the
mug
the
bread
and
butter
which
had
by
this
time
arrived
and
every
morsel
which
squeers
took
into
his
mouth
remained
with
strained
eyes
in
torments
of
expectation
thank
god
for
a
good
breakfast
said
squeers
when
he
had
finished
number
one
may
take
a
drink
number
one
seized
the
mug
ravenously
and
had
just
drunk
enough
to
make
him
wish
for
more
when
squeers
gave
the
signal
for
number
two
who
gave
up
at
the
same
interesting
moment
to
number
three
and
the
process
was
repeated
until
the
milk
and
water
terminated
with
number
five
and
now
said
the
schoolmaster
dividing
the
bread
and
butter
for
three
into
as
many
portions
as
there
were
children
you
had
better
look
sharp
with
your
breakfast
for
the
horn
will
blow
in
a
minute
or
two
and
then
every
boy
leaves
off
permission
being
thus
given
to
fall
to
the
boys
began
to
eat
voraciously
and
in
desperate
haste
while
the
schoolmaster
who
was
in
high
after
his
meal
picked
his
teeth
with
a
fork
and
looked
smilingly
on
in
a
very
short
time
the
horn
was
heard
i
thought
it
be
long
said
squeers
jumping
up
and
producing
a
little
basket
from
under
the
seat
put
what
you
had
time
to
eat
in
here
boys
want
it
on
the
road
nicholas
was
considerably
startled
by
these
very
economical
arrangements
but
he
had
no
time
to
reflect
upon
them
for
the
little
boys
had
to
be
got
up
to
the
top
of
the
coach
and
this
task
was
in
his
department
but
soon
they
were
all
stowed
away
and
the
coach
started
off
with
a
flourish
the
journey
proved
long
and
hard
however
they
were
detained
several
times
by
the
bad
roads
and
inclement
weather
so
that
it
was
not
until
nightfall
of
the
second
day
that
they
reached
their
destination
jump
out
said
squeers
hallo
there
come
and
put
this
horse
up
be
quick
will
you
while
the
schoolmaster
was
uttering
these
and
other
impatient
cries
nicholas
had
time
to
observe
that
the
school
was
a
long
house
one
story
high
with
a
few
straggling
outbuildings
behind
and
a
barn
and
stable
adjoining
after
the
lapse
of
a
minute
or
two
the
noise
of
somebody
unlocking
the
was
heard
and
presently
a
tall
lean
boy
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
issued
forth
is
that
you
smike
cried
squeers
yes
sir
replied
the
boy
then
why
the
devil
you
come
before
please
sir
i
fell
asleep
over
the
fire
answered
smike
with
humility
fire
what
fire
there
a
fire
demanded
the
schoolmaster
sharply
only
in
the
kitchen
sir
replied
the
boy
missus
said
as
i
was
sitting
up
i
might
go
in
there
for
a
warm
your
missus
is
a
fool
retorted
squeers
have
been
a
deuced
deal
more
wakeful
in
the
cold
engage
by
this
time
squeers
had
dismounted
and
after
ordering
the
boy
to
see
to
the
pony
and
to
take
care
that
he
any
more
corn
that
night
he
told
nicholas
to
wait
at
the
front
door
a
minute
while
he
went
round
and
let
him
in
a
host
of
unpleasant
misgivings
which
had
been
crowding
upon
nicholas
during
the
whole
journey
thronged
into
his
mind
with
redoubled
force
when
he
was
left
alone
and
as
he
looked
up
at
the
dreary
house
and
dark
windows
and
upon
the
wild
country
round
covered
with
snow
he
felt
a
depression
of
heart
and
spirit
which
he
had
never
experienced
before
presently
he
was
ushered
into
a
parlor
where
stood
a
large
angular
woman
about
half
a
head
taller
than
squeers
this
is
the
new
young
man
my
dear
said
that
gentleman
oh
replied
squeers
nodding
her
head
at
nicholas
and
eyeing
him
coldly
from
top
to
toe
take
a
meal
with
us
said
squeers
and
go
among
the
boys
morning
you
can
give
him
a
shakedown
here
you
we
must
manage
it
somehow
replied
the
lady
you
much
mind
how
you
sleep
i
suppose
sir
no
indeed
replied
nicholas
i
am
not
particular
lucky
said
squeers
and
as
the
humor
was
considered
to
lie
chiefly
in
retort
squeers
laughed
heartily
and
seemed
to
expect
that
nicholas
should
do
the
same
after
some
conversation
between
the
master
and
mistress
relative
to
the
success
of
trip
and
the
people
who
had
paid
and
the
people
who
had
made
default
in
payment
a
young
servant
girl
brought
in
a
yorkshire
pie
and
some
cold
beef
which
being
set
upon
the
table
the
boy
smike
appeared
with
a
jug
of
ale
squeers
was
emptying
his
pockets
of
letters
to
different
boys
and
other
small
documents
which
he
had
brought
down
in
them
the
boy
glanced
with
an
anxious
and
timid
expression
at
the
papers
as
if
with
a
sickly
hope
that
one
among
them
might
relate
to
him
the
look
was
a
very
painful
one
and
went
to
heart
at
once
for
it
told
a
long
and
very
sad
history
it
induced
him
to
consider
the
boy
more
attentively
and
he
was
surprised
to
observe
the
extraordinary
mixture
of
garments
which
formed
his
dress
although
he
could
not
have
been
less
than
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
old
and
was
tall
for
that
age
he
wore
a
skeleton
suit
such
as
is
usually
put
upon
very
little
boys
and
which
though
most
absurdly
short
in
the
arms
and
legs
was
quite
wide
enough
for
his
thin
body
in
order
that
the
lower
part
of
his
legs
might
be
in
perfect
keeping
with
this
singular
dress
he
had
a
very
large
pair
of
boots
originally
made
for
tops
which
might
have
been
once
worn
by
some
stout
farmer
but
were
now
too
patched
and
tattered
for
a
beggar
he
was
lame
and
as
he
feigned
to
be
busy
in
arranging
the
table
he
glanced
at
the
letters
with
a
look
so
keen
and
yet
so
dispirited
and
hopeless
that
nicholas
could
hardly
bear
to
watch
him
what
are
you
bothering
about
there
smike
cried
squeers
let
the
things
alone
you
eh
said
squeers
looking
up
oh
you
is
it
yes
sir
replied
the
youth
pressing
his
hands
together
as
though
to
control
by
force
the
nervous
wandering
of
his
fingers
is
well
said
squeers
have
nothing
been
me
devil
a
bit
replied
squeers
testily
the
lad
withdrew
his
eyes
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
face
moved
towards
the
door
not
a
word
resumed
squeers
and
never
will
be
now
this
is
a
pretty
sort
of
thing
it
that
you
should
have
been
left
here
all
these
years
and
no
money
paid
after
the
first
no
notice
taken
nor
no
clue
to
be
got
who
you
belong
to
a
pretty
sort
of
thing
that
i
should
have
to
feed
a
great
fellow
like
you
and
never
hope
to
get
one
penny
for
it
it
the
boy
put
his
hand
to
his
head
as
if
he
were
making
an
effort
to
recollect
something
and
then
looking
vacantly
at
his
questioner
gradually
broke
into
a
smile
and
limped
away
tell
you
what
squeers
remarked
his
wife
as
the
door
closed
i
think
that
young
turning
silly
i
hope
not
said
the
schoolmaster
for
a
handy
fellow
and
worth
his
meat
and
drink
anyway
i
should
think
have
wit
enough
for
us
though
if
he
was
supper
being
over
squeers
yawned
fearfully
and
was
of
opinion
that
it
was
high
time
to
go
to
bed
upon
this
squeers
and
a
servant
dragged
in
a
small
straw
mattress
and
a
couple
of
blankets
and
arranged
them
into
a
couch
for
nicholas
put
you
into
a
regular
bedroom
with
the
boys
nickleby
said
squeers
seven
in
the
morning
mind
the
next
morning
when
nicholas
appeared
in
the
main
room
he
found
squeers
very
much
distressed
i
find
the
school
spoon
she
said
never
mind
it
my
dear
observed
squeers
in
a
soothing
manner
of
no
consequence
no
consequence
why
how
you
talk
retorted
squeers
sharply
it
brimstone
morning
i
forgot
my
dear
rejoined
squeers
yes
it
certainly
is
we
purify
the
bloods
now
and
then
nickleby
purify
ends
said
his
lady
think
young
man
that
we
go
to
the
expense
of
brimstone
and
molasses
just
to
purify
them
because
if
you
think
we
carry
on
the
business
in
that
way
find
yourself
mistaken
and
so
i
tell
you
plainly
my
dear
said
squeers
frowning
hem
oh
nonsense
rejoined
squeers
if
the
young
man
comes
to
be
a
teacher
here
let
him
understand
at
once
that
we
want
any
foolery
about
the
boys
they
have
the
brimstone
and
treacle
partly
because
if
they
something
or
other
in
the
way
of
medicine
be
always
ailing
and
giving
a
world
of
trouble
and
partly
because
it
spoils
their
appetites
and
comes
cheaper
than
breakfast
and
dinner
so
it
does
them
good
and
us
good
at
the
same
time
and
fair
enough
sure
a
vast
deal
of
searching
and
rummaging
ensued
and
it
proving
fruitless
smike
was
called
in
and
pushed
by
squeers
and
boxed
by
squeers
which
course
of
treatment
brightening
his
intellects
enabled
him
to
suggest
that
possibly
squeers
might
have
the
spoon
in
her
indeed
turned
out
to
be
the
case
but
as
squeers
had
previously
protested
that
she
was
quite
certain
she
had
not
got
it
smike
received
another
box
on
the
ear
for
presuming
to
contradict
his
mistress
so
that
he
gained
nothing
of
advantage
by
his
idea
but
come
said
squeers
go
to
the
schoolroom
and
lend
me
a
hand
with
my
will
you
nicholas
assisted
his
master
to
put
on
an
old
and
squeers
arming
himself
with
his
cane
led
the
way
across
a
yard
to
a
door
in
the
rear
of
the
house
there
said
the
schoolmaster
as
they
stepped
in
together
this
is
our
shop
nickleby
it
was
such
a
crowded
scene
and
there
were
so
many
objects
to
attract
attention
that
at
first
nicholas
stared
about
him
really
without
seeing
anything
at
all
by
degrees
however
the
place
resolved
itself
into
a
bare
and
dirty
room
with
a
couple
of
windows
stopped
up
with
old
copybooks
and
paper
there
were
two
rickety
desks
cut
and
notched
and
inked
in
every
possible
way
two
or
three
forms
a
detached
desk
for
squeers
and
another
for
his
assistant
the
ceiling
was
supported
like
that
of
a
barn
by
crossbeams
and
rafters
and
the
walls
were
so
stained
and
discolored
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
they
had
ever
been
touched
with
paint
or
whitewash
but
the
pupils
how
the
last
faint
traces
of
hope
the
remotest
glimmering
of
any
good
to
be
derived
from
his
efforts
in
this
den
faded
from
the
mind
of
nicholas
as
he
looked
in
dismay
around
pale
and
haggard
faces
lank
and
bony
figures
children
with
the
countenances
of
old
men
boys
of
stunted
growth
and
others
whose
long
meagre
legs
would
hardly
bear
their
stooping
bodies
all
crowded
on
the
view
together
illustration
nicholas
and
smike
and
yet
this
scene
painful
as
it
was
had
its
grotesque
features
squeers
stood
at
one
of
the
desks
presiding
over
an
immense
basin
of
brimstone
and
treacle
of
which
delicious
compound
she
administered
a
large
instalment
to
each
boy
in
succession
using
for
the
purpose
a
common
wooden
spoon
which
might
have
been
originally
manufactured
for
some
gigantic
top
and
which
widened
every
young
mouth
considerably
they
being
all
obliged
under
heavy
penalties
to
take
in
the
whole
of
the
bowl
at
a
gulp
now
said
squeers
giving
the
desk
a
great
rap
with
his
cane
which
made
half
the
little
boys
nearly
jump
out
of
their
boots
is
that
physicking
over
just
over
said
squeers
choking
the
last
boy
in
her
hurry
and
tapping
the
crown
of
his
head
with
the
wooden
spoon
to
restore
him
here
you
smike
take
away
now
look
sharp
smike
shuffled
out
with
the
basin
and
squeers
having
called
up
a
little
boy
with
a
curly
head
and
wiped
her
hands
upon
it
hurried
out
after
him
into
a
species
of
where
there
was
a
small
fire
and
a
large
kettle
together
with
a
number
of
little
wooden
bowls
which
were
arranged
upon
a
board
into
these
bowls
squeers
assisted
by
the
hungry
servant
poured
a
brown
composition
which
looked
like
diluted
pincushions
without
the
covers
and
was
called
porridge
a
minute
wedge
of
brown
bread
was
inserted
in
each
bowl
and
when
they
had
eaten
their
porridge
by
means
of
the
bread
the
boys
ate
the
bread
itself
and
had
finished
their
breakfast
whereupon
squeers
said
in
a
solemn
voice
for
what
we
have
received
may
the
lord
make
us
truly
thankful
went
away
to
his
own
nicholas
filled
his
stomach
with
a
bowl
of
porridge
for
much
the
same
reason
which
induces
some
savages
to
swallow
they
should
be
hungry
when
there
is
nothing
to
eat
having
disposed
of
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
allotted
to
him
in
virtue
of
his
office
he
sat
himself
down
to
wait
for
he
could
not
but
observe
how
silent
and
sad
the
boys
all
seemed
to
be
there
was
none
of
the
noise
and
clamor
of
a
schoolroom
none
of
its
boisterous
play
or
hearty
mirth
the
children
sat
crouching
and
shivering
together
and
seemed
to
lack
the
spirit
to
move
about
the
only
pupil
who
seemed
at
all
playful
was
master
squeers
son
of
the
master
and
as
his
chief
amusement
was
to
tread
upon
the
other
toes
in
his
new
boots
his
flow
of
spirits
was
rather
disagreeable
than
otherwise
after
some
delay
squeers
reappeared
and
the
boys
took
their
places
and
their
books
of
which
latter
there
might
be
about
one
to
eight
learners
a
few
minutes
having
elapsed
during
which
squeers
looked
very
profound
as
if
he
had
a
perfect
apprehension
of
what
was
inside
all
the
books
and
could
say
every
word
of
their
contents
by
heart
if
he
only
chose
to
take
the
trouble
that
gentleman
called
up
the
first
class
obedient
to
this
summons
there
ranged
themselves
in
front
of
the
desk
scarecrows
out
at
knees
and
elbows
one
of
whom
placed
a
torn
and
filthy
book
beneath
his
learned
eye
this
is
the
first
class
in
english
spelling
and
philosophy
nickleby
said
squeers
beckoning
nicholas
to
stand
beside
him
get
up
a
latin
one
and
hand
that
over
to
you
now
then
the
first
boy
please
sir
cleaning
the
back
parlor
window
said
the
temporary
head
of
the
class
so
he
is
to
be
sure
rejoined
squeers
we
go
upon
the
practical
mode
of
teaching
nickleby
the
regular
education
system
clean
verb
active
to
make
bright
to
scour
when
the
boy
knows
this
out
of
book
he
goes
and
does
it
second
boy
a
horse
a
beast
sir
replied
the
boy
so
it
is
said
squeers
and
as
perfect
in
that
go
and
look
after
horse
and
rub
him
down
well
or
rub
you
down
the
rest
of
the
class
go
and
draw
water
till
somebody
tells
you
to
leave
off
for
and
they
want
the
coppers
filled
so
saying
he
dismissed
the
first
class
to
their
experiments
in
practical
philosophy
and
eyed
nicholas
with
a
look
half
cunning
and
half
doubtful
as
if
he
were
not
altogether
certain
what
he
might
think
of
him
by
this
time
the
way
we
do
it
nickleby
he
said
after
a
pause
nicholas
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
a
manner
that
was
scarcely
perceptible
and
said
he
saw
it
was
and
a
very
good
way
it
is
too
said
squeers
now
just
take
them
fourteen
little
boys
and
hear
them
some
reading
because
you
know
you
must
begin
to
be
useful
idling
about
here
do
squeers
said
this
as
if
it
had
suddenly
occurred
to
him
either
that
he
must
not
say
too
much
to
his
assistant
or
that
his
assistant
did
not
say
enough
to
him
in
praise
of
the
establishment
the
children
were
arranged
in
a
semicircle
round
the
new
master
and
he
was
soon
listening
to
their
dull
drawling
recital
of
those
stories
of
interest
which
are
to
be
found
in
the
spelling
books
in
this
exciting
occupation
the
morning
lagged
heavily
on
at
one
the
boys
having
previously
had
their
appetites
thoroughly
taken
away
by
and
potatoes
sat
down
in
the
kitchen
to
some
hard
salt
beef
of
which
nicholas
was
graciously
permitted
to
take
his
portion
to
his
own
solitary
desk
to
eat
it
there
in
peace
after
this
there
was
another
hour
of
crouching
in
the
schoolroom
and
shivering
with
cold
and
this
was
a
fair
sample
of
the
school
day
at
dotheboys
hall
there
was
a
small
stove
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
by
it
nicholas
sat
down
when
the
school
was
dismissed
so
that
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
every
bit
of
joy
had
gone
out
of
the
world
the
cruelty
and
coarseness
of
squeers
were
revolting
and
yet
nicholas
did
not
know
how
to
resent
it
or
which
way
to
turn
he
had
cast
his
lot
here
and
here
he
must
abide
as
he
was
absorbed
in
these
meditations
he
all
at
once
encountered
the
upturned
face
of
smike
who
was
on
his
knees
before
the
stove
picking
a
few
stray
cinders
from
the
hearth
and
planting
them
on
the
fire
he
had
paused
to
steal
a
look
at
nicholas
and
when
he
saw
that
he
was
observed
shrank
back
as
if
expecting
a
blow
you
need
not
fear
me
said
nicholas
kindly
are
you
cold
you
are
shivering
i
am
not
cold
replied
smike
quickly
i
am
used
to
it
there
was
such
an
obvious
fear
of
giving
offence
in
his
manner
and
he
was
such
a
timid
creature
that
nicholas
could
not
help
exclaiming
poor
fellow
if
he
had
struck
the
drudge
he
would
have
slunk
away
without
a
word
but
now
he
burst
into
tears
oh
dear
oh
dear
he
cried
covering
his
face
with
his
cracked
and
horny
hands
my
heart
will
break
it
will
it
will
hush
said
nicholas
laying
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
be
a
man
you
are
nearly
one
by
years
god
help
you
by
years
cried
smike
oh
dear
dear
how
many
of
them
how
many
of
them
since
i
was
a
little
child
younger
than
any
that
are
here
now
where
are
they
all
whom
do
you
speak
of
inquired
nicholas
wishing
to
rouse
the
poor
creature
to
reason
tell
me
my
friends
he
replied
what
sufferings
mine
have
been
there
is
always
hope
said
nicholas
he
knew
not
what
to
say
no
rejoined
the
other
no
none
for
me
do
you
remember
the
boy
that
died
here
i
was
not
here
you
know
said
nicholas
gently
but
what
of
him
why
replied
the
youth
drawing
closer
to
his
side
i
was
with
him
at
night
and
when
it
was
all
silent
he
cried
no
more
for
friends
he
wished
to
come
and
sit
with
him
but
began
to
see
faces
round
his
bed
that
came
from
home
he
said
they
smiled
and
talked
to
him
and
he
died
at
last
lifting
his
head
to
kiss
them
do
you
hear
yes
yes
rejoined
nicholas
what
faces
will
smile
on
me
when
i
die
cried
his
companion
shivering
who
will
talk
to
me
in
those
long
nights
they
can
not
come
from
home
they
would
frighten
me
if
they
did
for
i
know
what
it
is
and
know
them
pain
and
fear
pain
and
fear
for
me
alive
or
dead
no
hope
no
hope
the
bell
rang
to
bed
and
the
boy
subsiding
at
the
sound
into
his
usual
listless
state
crept
away
as
if
anxious
to
avoid
notice
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
nicholas
soon
not
retired
there
was
no
retirement
to
his
dirty
and
crowded
dormitory
how
smike
went
away
from
dotheboys
nicholas
was
of
a
naturally
optimistic
temper
however
and
he
lost
as
little
time
as
possible
brooding
over
his
difficulties
instead
he
began
at
once
to
try
to
make
the
school
something
more
than
a
farce
he
arranged
a
few
regular
lessons
for
the
boys
and
he
treated
the
poor
pupils
with
such
gentleness
and
sympathy
that
they
passed
from
dumb
amazement
at
the
first
to
blind
devotion
indeed
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
would
not
have
lain
down
cheerfully
and
let
him
walk
over
his
body
and
the
most
devoted
of
them
all
was
smike
nicholas
was
the
one
ray
of
sunlight
that
had
ever
come
into
this
wretched
life
and
in
return
smike
now
followed
him
to
and
fro
with
an
ever
restless
desire
to
serve
or
help
him
anticipating
such
little
wants
as
his
humble
ability
could
supply
and
content
only
to
be
near
him
he
would
sit
beside
him
for
hours
looking
patiently
into
his
face
and
a
word
would
brighten
up
his
careworn
visage
and
call
into
it
a
passing
gleam
even
of
happiness
he
was
an
altered
being
he
had
an
object
now
and
that
object
was
to
show
his
attachment
to
the
only
person
a
had
treated
him
not
to
say
with
kindness
but
like
a
human
creature
needless
to
say
squeers
speedily
took
a
dislike
to
nicholas
he
knew
of
the
scarcely
concealed
disdain
with
which
his
assistant
regarded
his
methods
squeers
was
jealous
also
of
the
influence
which
nicholas
had
so
soon
acquired
with
the
boys
slavish
affection
was
speedily
discovered
and
the
crafty
master
was
mean
enough
to
strike
at
nicholas
through
him
upon
this
poor
being
all
the
spleen
and
that
could
not
be
vented
on
nicholas
were
unceasingly
bestowed
drudgery
would
have
been
was
well
used
to
that
buffetings
inflicted
without
cause
would
have
been
equally
a
matter
of
course
for
to
them
also
he
had
served
a
long
and
weary
apprenticeship
but
it
was
no
sooner
observed
that
he
had
become
attached
to
nicholas
than
stripes
and
blows
stripes
and
blows
morning
noon
and
night
were
his
only
portion
nicholas
saw
it
and
ground
his
teeth
at
every
repetition
of
the
savage
and
cowardly
attack
but
at
present
he
saw
no
way
to
aid
the
boy
for
a
protest
would
mean
his
own
dismissal
and
the
lot
of
smike
and
the
others
would
become
that
much
harder
one
day
after
especially
harsh
treatment
the
boy
sat
huddled
in
a
dark
corner
by
himself
sobbing
as
though
his
heart
would
break
the
room
was
dark
and
deserted
when
nicholas
entered
but
he
heard
the
sound
of
weeping
and
went
over
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
head
do
not
for
sake
said
nicholas
in
an
agitated
voice
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
they
are
more
hard
with
me
than
ever
sobbed
the
boy
i
know
it
rejoined
nicholas
they
are
but
for
you
said
the
outcast
i
should
die
they
would
kill
me
they
would
i
know
they
would
you
will
do
better
poor
fellow
replied
nicholas
shaking
his
head
mournfully
when
i
am
gone
gone
cried
the
other
looking
intently
in
his
face
softly
rejoined
nicholas
yes
are
you
going
demanded
the
boy
in
an
earnest
whisper
i
can
not
say
replied
nicholas
i
was
speaking
more
to
my
own
thoughts
than
to
you
tell
me
said
the
boy
imploringly
oh
do
tell
me
you
you
i
shall
be
driven
to
that
at
last
said
nicholas
the
world
is
before
me
after
all
tell
me
urged
smike
is
the
world
as
bad
and
dismal
as
this
place
heaven
forbid
replied
nicholas
pursuing
the
train
of
his
own
thoughts
its
hardest
coarsest
toil
were
happiness
to
this
should
i
ever
meet
you
there
demanded
the
boy
speaking
with
unusual
wildness
yes
replied
nicholas
willing
to
soothe
him
no
no
said
the
other
clasping
him
by
the
hand
should
me
that
again
say
i
should
be
sure
to
find
you
you
would
replied
nicholas
with
the
same
humane
intention
and
i
would
help
and
aid
you
and
not
bring
fresh
sorrow
on
you
as
i
have
done
here
the
boy
caught
both
the
young
hands
passionately
in
his
and
hugging
them
to
his
breast
uttered
a
few
broken
sounds
which
were
unintelligible
squeers
entered
at
the
moment
and
he
shrank
back
into
his
old
corner
the
next
cold
gray
day
in
was
awakened
by
hearing
the
voice
of
squeers
roughly
demanding
that
smike
nicholas
looked
over
in
the
corner
where
the
boy
usually
slept
but
it
was
vacant
so
he
made
no
answer
smike
shouted
squeers
do
you
want
your
head
broke
in
a
fresh
place
smike
demanded
his
amiable
lady
in
the
same
key
still
there
was
no
reply
and
still
nicholas
stared
about
him
as
did
the
greater
part
of
the
boys
who
were
by
this
time
roused
confound
his
impudence
muttered
squeers
rapping
the
impatiently
with
his
cane
nickleby
well
sir
send
that
obstinate
scoundrel
down
you
hear
me
calling
he
is
not
here
sir
replied
nicholas
tell
me
a
lie
retorted
the
schoolmaster
he
is
he
is
not
retorted
nicholas
angrily
tell
me
one
we
shall
soon
see
that
said
squeers
rushing
upstairs
find
him
i
warrant
you
with
which
assurance
squeers
bounced
into
the
dormitory
and
swinging
his
cane
in
the
air
ready
for
a
blow
darted
into
the
corner
the
cane
descended
harmlessly
upon
the
ground
there
was
nobody
there
what
does
this
mean
said
squeers
turning
round
where
have
you
hid
him
i
have
seen
nothing
of
him
since
last
night
replied
nicholas
come
blustered
squeers
you
save
him
this
way
where
is
he
at
the
bottom
of
the
nearest
pond
for
aught
i
know
rejoined
nicholas
in
a
low
voice
and
fixing
his
eyes
full
on
the
face
confound
you
what
do
you
mean
by
that
retorted
squeers
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
inquired
of
the
boys
whether
any
one
among
them
knew
anything
of
their
missing
schoolmate
there
was
a
general
hum
of
anxious
denial
in
the
midst
of
which
one
shrill
voice
was
heard
to
say
as
indeed
everybody
thought
please
sir
i
think
run
away
sir
ha
cried
squeers
turning
sharp
round
who
said
that
and
pouncing
suddenly
he
seized
a
small
urchin
who
was
rewarded
for
his
suggestion
so
soundly
that
he
howled
with
pain
there
said
squeers
now
if
any
other
boy
thinks
smike
has
run
away
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
a
talk
with
him
there
was
of
course
a
profound
silence
during
which
nicholas
showed
his
disgust
as
plainly
as
looks
could
show
it
well
nickleby
said
squeers
eyeing
him
maliciously
think
he
has
run
away
i
suppose
i
think
it
extremely
likely
replied
nicholas
in
a
quiet
manner
oh
you
do
do
you
sneered
squeers
maybe
you
know
he
has
i
know
nothing
of
the
kind
he
tell
you
he
was
going
i
suppose
did
he
continued
squeers
he
did
not
replied
nicholas
i
am
very
glad
he
did
not
for
it
would
then
have
been
my
duty
to
have
warned
you
in
time
which
no
doubt
you
would
have
been
devilish
sorry
to
do
said
squeers
in
a
taunting
fashion
i
should
indeed
replied
nicholas
meanwhile
squeers
who
had
been
hunting
elsewhere
for
the
boy
bustled
in
with
great
excitement
he
is
off
said
she
the
and
stable
are
locked
up
so
he
be
there
and
not
downstairs
anywhere
for
the
girl
has
looked
he
must
have
gone
york
way
and
by
a
public
road
too
why
must
he
inquired
squeers
stupid
said
squeers
angrily
he
any
money
had
he
never
had
a
penny
of
his
own
in
his
whole
life
that
i
know
of
replied
squeers
to
be
sure
rejoined
squeers
and
he
take
anything
to
eat
with
him
that
answer
for
so
of
course
he
must
beg
his
way
and
he
could
do
that
nowhere
but
on
the
public
road
true
exclaimed
squeers
clapping
his
hands
true
yes
but
you
would
never
have
thought
of
it
for
all
that
if
i
said
so
replied
his
wife
now
if
you
take
the
chaise
and
go
one
road
and
i
borrow
chaise
and
go
the
other
what
with
keeping
our
eyes
open
and
asking
questions
one
or
other
of
us
is
pretty
certain
to
lay
hold
of
him
the
worthy
plan
was
put
into
action
without
delay
while
nicholas
remained
behind
in
a
tumult
of
anxiety
he
realized
the
bitter
consequences
of
rash
act
the
boy
was
liable
to
freeze
or
starve
to
death
on
the
could
not
perhaps
be
much
worse
than
to
fall
again
into
the
clutches
of
and
squeers
all
that
day
there
was
no
tidings
of
the
runaway
but
at
daybreak
the
second
morning
the
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
nicholas
hardly
dared
to
look
out
of
the
window
but
he
did
so
and
the
very
first
object
that
met
his
eyes
was
the
wretched
smike
so
bedabbled
with
mud
and
rain
so
haggard
and
worn
and
wild
that
but
for
his
garments
being
such
as
no
scarecrow
was
ever
seen
to
wear
he
might
have
been
doubtful
even
then
of
his
identity
lift
him
out
said
squeers
after
he
had
literally
feasted
his
eyes
in
silence
upon
the
culprit
bring
him
in
bring
him
in
smike
to
all
appearance
more
dead
than
alive
was
brought
into
the
house
and
securely
locked
up
in
a
cellar
until
such
time
as
squeers
should
deem
it
expedient
to
operate
upon
him
in
presence
of
the
assembled
school
after
a
hasty
breakfast
of
very
thin
porridge
the
boys
were
summoned
to
the
schoolroom
by
resounding
whacks
on
the
desk
from
an
whip
in
the
hands
of
the
master
is
every
boy
here
asked
squeers
in
a
tremendous
voice
every
boy
was
there
but
every
boy
was
afraid
to
speak
so
squeers
glared
along
the
lines
to
assure
himself
and
every
eye
drooped
and
every
head
cowered
down
as
he
did
so
each
boy
keep
his
place
said
squeers
administering
his
favorite
blow
to
the
desk
and
regarding
with
gloomy
satisfaction
the
universal
start
which
it
never
failed
to
occasion
nickleby
to
your
desk
sir
it
was
remarked
by
more
than
one
small
observer
that
there
was
a
very
curious
and
unusual
expression
in
the
face
but
he
took
his
seat
without
opening
his
lips
in
reply
squeers
casting
a
triumphant
glance
at
his
assistant
and
a
scowl
on
the
boys
left
the
room
and
shortly
afterwards
returned
dragging
smike
by
the
collar
in
any
other
place
the
appearance
of
the
wretched
jaded
spiritless
object
would
have
occasioned
a
murmur
of
compassion
and
remonstrance
it
had
some
effect
even
there
for
the
moved
uneasily
in
their
seats
and
a
few
of
the
boldest
ventured
to
steal
looks
at
each
other
expressive
of
indignation
and
pity
they
were
lost
on
squeers
however
whose
gaze
was
fastened
on
the
luckless
smike
as
he
inquired
according
to
custom
in
such
cases
whether
he
had
anything
to
say
for
himself
nothing
i
suppose
said
squeers
with
a
diabolical
grin
smike
glanced
round
and
his
eye
rested
for
an
instant
on
nicholas
as
if
he
had
expected
him
to
intercede
but
his
look
was
riveted
on
his
desk
have
you
anything
to
say
demanded
squeers
again
giving
his
right
arm
two
or
three
flourishes
to
try
its
power
and
suppleness
stand
a
little
out
of
the
way
squeers
my
dear
hardly
got
room
enough
spare
me
sir
cried
smike
oh
all
is
it
said
squeers
yes
flog
you
within
an
inch
of
your
life
and
spare
you
that
ha
ha
ha
laughed
squeers
a
good
i
was
driven
to
do
it
said
smike
faintly
and
casting
another
imploring
look
about
him
driven
to
do
it
were
you
said
squeers
oh
it
your
fault
it
was
mine
i
then
he
caught
the
boy
firmly
in
his
grip
one
desperate
cut
had
fallen
on
his
was
wincing
from
the
lash
and
uttering
a
scream
of
was
raised
again
and
again
about
to
nicholas
nickleby
suddenly
starting
up
cried
in
a
voice
that
made
the
rafters
ring
who
cried
stop
said
squeers
turning
savagely
round
i
said
nicholas
stepping
forward
this
must
not
go
on
must
not
go
on
cried
squeers
almost
in
a
shriek
thundered
nicholas
aghast
at
the
boldness
of
this
interference
squeers
released
his
hold
of
smike
and
falling
back
a
pace
or
two
gazed
upon
nicholas
with
looks
that
were
positively
frightful
i
say
repeated
nicholas
nothing
daunted
i
will
prevent
it
squeers
continued
to
gaze
upon
him
with
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
but
astonishment
had
actually
for
the
moment
bereft
him
of
speech
you
have
disregarded
all
my
quiet
interference
in
the
miserable
behalf
said
nicholas
you
have
returned
no
answer
to
the
letter
in
which
i
begged
forgiveness
for
him
and
offered
to
be
responsible
that
he
would
remain
quietly
here
blame
me
for
this
public
interference
you
have
brought
it
upon
yourself
not
i
sit
down
beggar
screamed
squeers
almost
beside
himself
with
rage
and
seizing
smike
as
he
spoke
wretch
rejoined
nicholas
fiercely
touch
him
at
your
peril
i
will
not
stand
by
and
see
it
done
my
blood
is
up
and
i
have
the
strength
of
ten
such
men
as
you
look
to
yourself
for
by
heaven
i
will
not
spare
you
if
you
drive
me
on
stand
back
cried
squeers
brandishing
his
weapon
i
have
a
long
series
of
insults
to
avenge
said
nicholas
flushed
with
passion
and
my
indignation
is
aggravated
by
the
cruelties
of
this
foul
den
have
a
care
for
if
you
rouse
me
farther
the
consequences
shall
fall
heavily
upon
your
own
head
he
had
scarcely
spoken
when
squeers
in
a
violent
outbreak
of
wrath
struck
him
a
blow
across
the
face
which
raised
up
a
bar
of
livid
flesh
as
it
was
inflicted
smarting
with
the
agony
of
the
blow
and
concentrating
into
that
one
moment
all
its
feelings
of
rage
and
scorn
nicholas
sprang
upon
him
wrested
the
weapon
from
his
hand
and
pinning
him
by
the
throat
beat
the
ruffian
till
he
roared
for
mercy
then
nicholas
left
the
astounded
boys
and
the
crestfallen
master
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
he
looked
anxiously
around
for
smike
as
he
closed
the
door
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
he
must
face
the
world
again
but
told
be
better
than
this
so
he
packed
up
a
few
clothes
in
a
small
valise
and
finding
that
nobody
offered
to
oppose
him
he
marched
boldly
out
by
the
front
door
and
struck
into
the
road
which
led
to
greta
bridge
he
did
not
travel
far
that
day
as
there
had
been
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
which
made
the
way
toilsome
and
hard
to
find
he
lay
that
night
at
a
cottage
where
beds
were
let
at
a
cheap
rate
to
the
more
humble
class
of
travellers
and
rising
betimes
next
morning
made
his
way
before
night
to
boroughbridge
passing
through
that
town
in
search
of
some
cheap
he
stumbled
upon
an
empty
barn
within
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
of
the
roadside
in
a
warm
corner
of
which
he
stretched
his
weary
limbs
and
soon
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
next
morning
and
tried
to
recollect
his
dreams
which
had
been
all
connected
with
his
recent
sojourn
at
dotheboys
hall
he
sat
up
rubbed
his
eyes
and
with
the
most
composed
countenance
some
motionless
object
which
seemed
to
be
stationed
within
a
few
yards
in
front
of
him
strange
cried
nicholas
can
this
be
some
lingering
creation
of
the
visions
that
have
scarcely
left
me
it
can
not
be
yet
am
awake
smike
the
form
moved
rose
advanced
and
dropped
upon
its
knees
at
his
feet
it
was
smike
indeed
why
do
you
kneel
to
me
said
nicholas
hastily
raising
him
to
go
with
the
end
replied
smike
clinging
to
his
hand
let
me
oh
do
let
me
you
are
my
kind
me
with
you
pray
i
am
a
friend
who
can
do
little
for
you
said
nicholas
kindly
how
came
you
here
he
had
followed
him
it
seemed
had
never
lost
sight
of
him
all
the
way
had
watched
while
he
slept
and
when
he
halted
for
refreshment
and
had
feared
to
appear
before
lest
he
should
be
sent
back
he
had
not
intended
to
appear
now
but
nicholas
had
awakened
more
suddenly
than
he
looked
for
and
he
had
had
no
time
to
conceal
himself
poor
fellow
said
nicholas
your
hard
fate
denies
you
any
friend
but
one
and
he
is
nearly
as
poor
and
helpless
as
yourself
may
i
go
with
you
asked
smike
timidly
i
will
be
your
faithful
servant
i
will
indeed
i
want
no
clothes
added
the
poor
creature
drawing
his
rags
together
these
will
do
very
well
i
only
want
to
be
near
you
and
you
shall
cried
nicholas
and
the
world
shall
deal
by
you
as
it
does
by
me
till
one
or
both
of
us
shall
quit
it
for
a
better
come
with
these
words
he
strapped
his
valise
on
his
shoulders
and
taking
his
stick
in
one
hand
extended
the
other
to
the
delighted
boy
and
so
they
passed
out
of
the
old
barn
together
and
in
the
days
to
thick
and
and
nicholas
fought
their
battles
story
of
little
in
the
old
curiosity
it
was
a
queer
home
for
a
place
where
little
nell
lived
with
her
grandfather
he
was
a
dealer
in
all
sorts
of
curious
old
things
suits
of
mail
which
stood
like
ghosts
in
armor
here
and
there
fantastic
carved
tables
and
chairs
rusty
weapons
of
various
kinds
distorted
figures
in
china
and
wood
and
iron
and
amid
it
all
the
oldest
thing
in
the
shop
seemed
to
be
the
little
old
man
with
the
long
gray
hair
the
only
bit
of
youth
was
nell
herself
and
yet
she
had
a
strange
intermingling
of
dignity
and
responsibility
in
spite
of
her
small
figure
and
childish
ways
her
fourteen
years
of
life
had
left
her
undecided
between
childhood
and
girlhood
she
had
not
begun
to
grow
up
and
yet
she
was
an
orphan
accustomed
to
doing
everything
for
herself
her
grandfather
tried
in
his
way
to
take
care
of
her
for
he
loved
her
dearly
but
between
the
tending
of
his
shop
and
the
mysterious
journeys
which
he
made
night
after
night
the
child
was
often
sent
upon
strange
errands
or
left
alone
in
the
old
house
and
at
all
times
it
was
she
who
took
care
of
him
but
the
old
man
did
not
see
that
this
lonely
life
was
putting
lines
of
sorrow
into
her
face
to
him
she
was
still
the
child
of
yesterday
and
happy
she
had
been
happy
once
she
had
gone
singing
through
the
dim
rooms
and
moving
with
gay
step
among
their
dusty
treasures
making
them
older
by
her
young
life
and
sterner
and
more
grim
by
her
cheerful
presence
but
now
the
chambers
were
cold
and
gloomy
and
when
she
left
her
own
little
room
to
while
away
the
tedious
hours
and
sat
in
one
of
them
she
was
still
and
motionless
as
their
inanimate
occupants
and
had
no
heart
to
startle
the
from
their
long
her
voice
in
one
of
these
rooms
was
a
window
looking
into
the
street
where
the
child
sat
many
and
many
a
long
evening
and
often
far
into
the
night
alone
and
thoughtful
none
are
so
anxious
as
those
who
watch
and
wait
and
at
these
times
mournful
fancies
came
flocking
on
her
mind
in
crowds
she
knew
instinctively
that
her
grandfather
was
hiding
something
from
her
what
it
was
she
could
not
guess
but
these
regular
journeys
at
night
while
she
watched
and
waited
left
him
only
the
more
fretful
and
careworn
he
seemed
to
have
a
constant
fever
for
something
yet
all
he
would
say
was
that
he
would
some
day
leave
her
a
fortune
meanwhile
he
had
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
quilp
a
terrible
dwarf
who
had
lent
him
money
from
time
to
time
until
the
entire
contents
of
the
shop
were
mortgaged
so
it
is
not
strange
that
little
nell
should
have
mournful
thoughts
when
the
night
had
worn
away
the
child
would
close
the
window
and
even
smile
with
the
first
dawn
of
light
at
her
fears
then
after
praying
earnestly
for
her
grandfather
and
the
restoring
of
their
former
happy
days
she
would
unlatch
the
door
for
him
and
fall
into
a
troubled
sleep
one
night
the
old
man
said
that
he
would
not
leave
home
the
face
lit
up
at
the
news
but
became
grave
again
when
she
saw
how
worried
he
looked
you
took
my
note
safely
to
quilp
you
say
he
asked
fretfully
what
did
he
tell
you
nell
exactly
what
i
told
you
dear
grandfather
indeed
true
said
the
old
man
faintly
yes
but
tell
me
again
nell
my
head
fails
me
what
was
it
that
he
told
you
nothing
more
than
that
he
would
see
me
or
next
day
that
was
in
the
note
nothing
more
said
the
child
shall
i
go
to
him
again
dear
grandfather
very
early
i
will
be
there
and
back
before
breakfast
the
old
man
shook
his
head
and
sighing
mournfully
drew
her
towards
him
would
be
no
use
my
dear
no
earthly
use
but
if
he
deserts
me
nell
at
this
he
deserts
me
now
when
i
should
with
his
assistance
be
recompensed
for
all
the
time
and
money
i
have
lost
and
all
the
agony
of
mind
i
have
undergone
which
makes
me
what
you
see
i
am
ruined
and
worse
worse
than
have
ruined
you
for
whom
i
ventured
all
if
we
are
what
if
we
are
said
the
child
boldly
let
us
be
beggars
and
be
happy
happy
said
the
old
man
poor
child
dear
grandfather
cried
the
girl
with
an
energy
which
shone
in
her
flushed
face
trembling
voice
and
impassioned
gesture
i
am
not
a
child
in
that
i
think
but
even
if
i
am
oh
hear
me
pray
that
we
may
beg
or
work
in
open
roads
or
fields
to
earn
a
scanty
living
rather
than
live
as
we
do
now
nelly
said
the
old
man
yes
yes
rather
than
live
as
we
do
now
the
child
repeated
more
earnestly
than
before
if
you
are
sorrowful
let
me
know
why
and
be
sorrowful
too
if
you
waste
away
and
are
paler
and
weaker
every
day
let
me
be
your
nurse
and
try
to
comfort
you
if
you
are
poor
let
us
be
poor
together
but
let
me
be
with
you
do
let
me
be
with
you
do
not
let
me
see
such
change
and
not
know
why
or
i
shall
break
my
heart
the
voice
was
lost
in
sobs
as
she
clasped
her
arms
about
the
old
neck
nor
did
she
weep
alone
these
were
not
words
for
other
ears
nor
was
it
a
scene
for
other
eyes
and
yet
other
ears
and
eyes
were
there
and
greedily
taking
in
all
that
passed
and
moreover
they
were
the
ears
and
eyes
of
no
less
a
person
than
daniel
quilp
who
having
entered
unseen
when
the
child
first
placed
herself
at
the
old
side
stood
looking
on
with
his
accustomed
grin
standing
however
being
tiresome
and
the
dwarf
being
one
of
that
kind
of
persons
who
usually
make
themselves
at
home
he
soon
cast
his
eyes
upon
a
chair
into
which
he
skipped
with
uncommon
agility
and
perching
himself
on
the
back
with
his
feet
upon
the
seat
was
thus
enabled
to
look
on
and
listen
with
greater
comfort
to
himself
besides
gratifying
at
the
same
time
that
taste
for
doing
something
fantastic
and
which
on
all
occasions
had
strong
possession
of
him
here
then
he
sat
one
leg
cocked
carelessly
over
the
other
his
chin
resting
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
his
head
turned
a
little
on
one
side
and
his
ugly
features
twisted
into
a
complacent
grimace
and
in
this
position
the
old
man
happening
in
course
of
time
to
look
that
way
chanced
to
see
him
the
child
uttered
a
suppressed
shriek
on
beholding
this
figure
in
their
first
surprise
both
she
and
the
old
man
not
knowing
what
to
say
and
half
doubting
its
reality
looked
shrinkingly
at
it
not
at
all
disconcerted
by
this
reception
daniel
quilp
preserved
the
same
attitude
merely
nodding
twice
or
thrice
with
great
condescension
at
length
the
old
man
pronounced
his
name
and
inquired
how
he
came
there
through
the
door
said
quilp
pointing
over
his
shoulder
with
his
thumb
not
quite
small
enough
to
get
through
keyholes
i
wish
i
was
i
want
to
have
some
talk
with
you
particularly
and
in
nobody
present
neighbor
little
nelly
nell
looked
at
the
old
man
who
nodded
to
her
to
retire
and
kissed
her
cheek
the
dwarf
said
never
a
word
but
watched
his
companion
as
he
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
and
presently
returned
to
his
seat
here
he
remained
with
his
head
bowed
upon
his
breast
for
some
time
and
then
suddenly
raising
it
said
once
and
once
for
all
have
you
brought
me
any
money
no
returned
quilp
then
said
the
old
man
clenching
his
hands
desperately
and
looking
upward
the
child
and
i
are
lost
neighbor
said
quilp
glancing
sternly
at
him
and
beating
his
hand
twice
or
thrice
upon
the
table
to
attract
his
wandering
attention
let
me
be
plain
with
you
and
play
a
fairer
game
than
when
you
held
all
the
cards
and
i
saw
but
the
backs
and
nothing
more
you
have
no
secret
from
me
now
the
old
man
looked
up
trembling
you
are
surprised
said
quilp
well
perhaps
natural
you
have
no
secret
from
me
now
i
say
no
not
one
for
now
i
know
that
all
those
sums
of
money
that
all
those
loans
advances
and
supplies
that
you
have
had
from
me
have
found
their
way
i
say
the
word
aye
replied
the
old
man
say
it
if
you
will
to
the
rejoined
quilp
your
nightly
haunt
this
was
the
precious
scheme
to
make
your
fortune
was
it
this
was
the
secret
certain
source
of
wealth
in
which
i
was
to
have
sunk
my
money
if
i
had
been
the
fool
you
took
me
for
this
was
your
inexhaustible
mine
of
gold
your
el
dorado
eh
yes
cried
the
old
man
turning
upon
him
with
gleaming
eyes
it
was
it
is
it
will
be
till
i
die
that
i
should
have
been
blinded
said
quilp
looking
contemptuously
at
him
by
a
mere
shallow
gambler
i
am
no
gambler
cried
the
old
man
fiercely
i
call
heaven
to
witness
that
i
never
played
for
gain
of
mine
or
love
of
play
it
was
all
for
my
little
nelly
i
had
sworn
to
leave
her
rich
when
did
you
first
begin
this
mad
career
asked
quilp
his
taunting
inclination
subdued
for
a
moment
by
the
old
grief
and
wildness
when
did
i
first
begin
he
rejoined
passing
his
hand
across
his
brow
when
was
it
that
i
first
began
when
should
it
be
but
when
i
began
to
think
how
little
i
had
saved
how
long
a
time
it
took
to
save
at
all
how
short
a
time
i
might
have
at
my
age
to
live
and
how
she
would
be
left
to
the
rough
mercies
of
the
world
with
barely
enough
to
keep
her
from
the
sorrows
that
wait
on
poverty
then
it
was
that
i
began
to
think
about
it
humph
the
old
story
said
the
dwarf
you
lost
what
money
you
had
laid
by
first
and
then
came
to
me
while
i
thought
you
were
making
your
fortune
as
you
said
you
were
you
were
making
yourself
a
beggar
eh
dear
me
and
so
it
comes
to
pass
that
i
hold
every
security
you
could
scrape
together
and
a
bill
of
sale
upon
the
stock
and
property
but
did
you
never
win
never
groaned
the
old
man
never
won
back
my
loss
i
thought
sneered
the
dwarf
that
if
a
man
played
long
enough
he
was
sure
to
win
at
last
or
at
the
worst
not
to
come
off
a
loser
and
so
he
is
cried
the
old
man
so
he
is
i
have
felt
that
from
the
first
i
have
always
known
it
seen
it
i
never
felt
it
half
so
strongly
as
i
feel
it
now
quilp
i
have
dreamed
three
nights
of
winning
the
same
large
sum
i
never
could
dream
that
dream
before
though
i
have
often
tried
do
not
desert
me
now
i
have
this
chance
i
have
no
resource
but
you
me
some
help
let
me
try
this
one
last
hope
the
dwarf
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
shook
his
head
nay
quilp
quilp
gasped
the
old
man
extending
his
hands
in
entreaty
let
me
try
just
this
once
more
i
tell
you
it
is
not
for
is
for
oh
i
can
not
die
and
leave
her
in
poverty
i
do
it
really
said
quilp
with
unusual
politeness
and
grinning
and
making
a
low
bow
he
passed
out
of
the
door
the
dwarf
was
for
once
as
good
as
his
word
he
not
only
refused
to
lend
any
more
money
but
he
at
once
began
to
make
plans
for
closing
the
shop
the
old
man
was
so
that
he
fell
ill
of
a
raging
fever
and
for
days
was
delirious
little
nell
his
only
nurse
gradually
learned
the
truth
about
her
evening
it
added
all
the
more
to
her
sorrow
at
last
when
he
was
well
enough
to
go
about
again
the
impatient
dwarf
would
not
be
put
off
any
longer
in
regard
to
the
sale
an
early
day
was
fixed
for
it
and
the
old
dealer
no
longer
offered
any
objections
instead
he
sat
quietly
dully
in
his
chair
looking
at
a
tiny
patch
of
green
through
his
window
to
one
who
had
been
tossing
on
a
restless
bed
so
long
even
these
few
green
leaves
and
this
tranquil
light
although
it
languished
among
chimneys
and
were
pleasant
things
they
suggested
quiet
places
afar
off
and
rest
and
peace
the
child
thought
more
than
once
that
he
was
moved
and
had
forborne
to
speak
but
now
he
shed
that
it
lightened
her
aching
heart
to
making
as
though
he
would
fall
upon
his
knees
he
besought
her
to
forgive
him
forgive
said
nell
interposing
to
prevent
his
purpose
oh
grandfather
what
should
forgive
all
that
is
past
all
that
has
come
upon
you
nell
returned
the
old
man
do
not
talk
so
said
the
child
pray
do
not
let
us
speak
of
something
else
yes
yes
we
will
he
rejoined
and
it
shall
be
of
what
we
talked
of
long
is
it
or
weeks
or
days
which
is
it
nell
i
do
not
understand
you
said
the
child
you
said
let
us
be
beggars
and
happy
in
the
open
fields
he
answered
oh
let
us
go
yes
let
us
go
said
nell
earnestly
there
will
we
find
happiness
and
peace
and
so
it
was
arranged
on
the
night
before
the
public
auction
they
were
to
steal
forth
quietly
out
into
the
wide
world
the
old
man
had
slept
for
some
hours
soundly
in
his
bed
while
she
was
busily
engaged
in
preparing
for
their
flight
there
were
a
few
articles
of
clothing
for
herself
to
carry
and
a
few
for
him
old
garments
such
as
became
their
fallen
fortunes
laid
out
to
wear
and
a
staff
to
support
his
feeble
steps
put
ready
for
his
use
but
this
was
not
all
her
task
for
now
she
must
visit
the
old
rooms
for
the
last
time
and
how
different
the
parting
with
them
was
from
any
she
had
expected
and
most
of
all
from
that
which
she
had
oftenest
pictured
to
herself
how
could
she
ever
have
thought
of
bidding
them
farewell
in
triumph
lonely
and
sad
though
her
days
had
been
she
sat
down
at
the
window
where
she
had
spent
so
many
far
than
every
thought
of
hope
or
cheerfulness
that
had
occurred
to
her
in
that
place
came
vividly
upon
her
mind
and
blotted
out
all
its
dull
and
mournful
associations
in
an
instant
her
own
little
room
too
where
she
had
so
often
knelt
down
and
prayed
at
for
the
time
which
she
hoped
was
dawning
little
room
where
she
had
slept
so
peacefully
and
dreamed
such
pleasant
was
hard
to
leave
it
without
one
kind
look
or
grateful
tear
but
at
last
she
was
ready
to
go
and
her
grandfather
was
awakened
just
as
the
first
rays
of
dawn
were
seen
they
stole
forth
noiselessly
hand
in
hand
they
dared
not
awaken
quilp
who
was
sleeping
that
night
in
the
shop
to
guard
his
prospective
wealth
out
in
the
middle
of
the
street
they
paused
which
way
said
the
child
the
old
man
looked
irresolutely
and
helplessly
first
at
her
then
to
the
right
and
left
then
at
her
again
and
shook
his
head
it
was
plain
that
she
was
thenceforth
his
guide
and
leader
the
child
felt
it
but
had
no
doubts
or
misgiving
and
putting
her
hand
in
his
led
him
gently
away
out
in
the
wide
it
was
a
bright
morning
in
june
when
nell
and
her
grandfather
set
forth
upon
their
travels
out
of
the
city
they
walked
briskly
for
the
desire
to
leave
their
old
elude
strong
upon
them
nell
had
provided
a
simple
lunch
for
that
needs
and
at
night
they
stopped
and
weary
at
a
hospitable
farmhouse
late
in
the
next
day
they
chanced
to
pass
a
country
church
among
the
tombstones
at
one
side
they
saw
two
men
who
were
seated
upon
the
grass
so
busily
at
work
as
not
to
notice
the
newcomers
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
that
they
were
of
a
class
of
travelling
showmen
who
went
from
town
to
town
showing
punch
and
his
antics
for
perched
upon
a
tombstone
was
a
figure
of
that
hero
himself
his
nose
and
chin
as
hooked
and
his
face
as
beaming
as
usual
scattered
upon
the
ground
were
the
other
members
of
the
play
in
various
stages
of
repair
while
the
two
showmen
were
engaged
with
glue
hammer
and
tacks
in
putting
their
proper
parts
more
strongly
together
the
showmen
raised
their
eyes
when
the
old
man
and
his
young
companion
were
close
upon
them
and
pausing
in
their
work
returned
their
looks
of
curiosity
one
of
them
the
actual
exhibitor
no
doubt
was
a
little
man
with
a
twinkling
eye
and
a
red
nose
who
seemed
to
have
unconsciously
imbibed
something
of
his
character
the
was
he
who
took
the
rather
a
careful
and
cautious
look
which
was
perhaps
inseparable
from
his
occupation
also
the
merry
man
was
the
first
to
greet
the
strangers
with
a
nod
and
following
the
old
eyes
he
observed
that
perhaps
that
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
seen
a
punch
off
the
stage
why
do
you
come
here
to
do
this
asked
the
old
man
after
answering
their
greeting
why
you
see
rejoined
the
little
man
putting
up
for
at
the
yonder
and
it
do
to
let
see
the
present
company
undergoing
repair
no
cried
the
old
man
making
signs
to
nell
to
listen
why
not
eh
why
not
because
it
would
destroy
all
the
delusion
and
take
away
all
the
interest
it
replied
the
little
man
would
you
care
a
for
the
lord
chancellor
if
you
him
in
private
and
without
his
wig
not
good
said
the
old
man
venturing
to
touch
one
of
the
puppets
and
drawing
away
his
hand
with
a
shrill
laugh
are
you
going
to
show
are
you
that
is
the
intention
governor
replied
the
other
look
here
he
continued
turning
to
his
partner
all
this
clothes
falling
to
pieces
again
much
good
you
do
at
sewing
things
seeing
that
they
were
at
a
loss
the
child
said
timidly
i
have
a
needle
sir
in
my
basket
and
thread
too
will
you
let
me
try
to
mend
it
for
you
i
think
i
can
do
it
neater
than
you
could
the
showman
had
nothing
to
urge
against
a
proposal
so
seasonable
nelly
kneeling
down
beside
the
box
was
soon
busily
engaged
in
her
task
and
accomplishing
it
to
a
miracle
while
she
was
thus
engaged
the
merry
little
man
looked
at
her
with
an
interest
which
did
not
appear
to
be
diminished
when
he
glanced
at
her
helpless
companion
when
she
had
finished
her
work
he
thanked
her
and
inquired
whither
they
were
travelling
farther
i
think
said
the
child
looking
towards
her
grandfather
if
wanting
a
place
to
stop
at
the
man
remarked
i
should
advise
you
to
take
up
at
the
same
house
with
us
long
low
white
house
there
very
cheap
come
along
the
tavern
was
kept
by
a
fat
old
landlord
and
landlady
who
made
no
objection
to
receiving
their
new
guests
but
praised
beauty
and
were
at
once
prepossessed
in
her
behalf
there
was
no
other
company
in
the
kitchen
but
the
two
showmen
and
the
child
felt
very
thankful
that
they
had
fallen
upon
such
good
quarters
the
landlady
was
very
much
astonished
to
learn
that
they
had
come
all
the
way
from
london
and
appeared
to
have
no
little
curiosity
touching
their
farther
destination
but
nell
could
give
her
no
very
clear
replies
that
evening
the
wayfarers
enjoyed
the
punch
show
though
poor
nell
was
so
tired
that
she
went
to
sleep
early
in
the
performance
the
next
morning
she
met
the
showmen
at
breakfast
and
where
are
you
going
asked
the
little
man
with
the
red
nose
indeed
i
hardly
know
we
have
not
decided
replied
the
child
going
to
the
races
said
the
little
man
if
your
way
and
like
to
have
us
for
company
let
us
travel
together
go
with
you
and
gladly
interposed
grandfather
eagerly
for
he
had
been
as
pleased
as
a
child
with
the
performance
of
punch
nell
was
a
trifle
alarmed
over
the
prospect
of
a
crowded
but
this
seemed
their
best
chance
to
press
forward
so
she
accepted
the
invitation
thankfully
for
several
days
they
travelled
together
and
despite
the
wearisome
way
the
child
found
much
novelty
and
interest
in
the
wandering
life
but
presently
she
became
uneasy
in
the
changed
attitude
of
the
two
showmen
from
being
ordinarily
kind
they
now
seemed
to
watch
nell
and
her
grandfather
so
closely
as
not
to
suffer
them
out
of
their
sight
the
showmen
had
in
fact
got
it
into
their
heads
that
the
two
wayfarers
were
not
common
people
but
runaways
for
whom
a
reward
must
even
now
be
posted
in
london
and
so
they
resolved
to
deliver
them
over
to
the
proper
authorities
at
the
first
opportunity
and
claim
the
reward
now
although
nell
and
her
grandfather
had
a
perfect
right
to
go
where
they
pleased
and
there
was
no
reward
offered
they
were
at
all
times
fearful
of
being
pursued
by
that
terrible
quilp
so
nell
determined
to
flee
from
these
two
watchful
men
at
the
earliest
moment
the
chance
of
escape
offered
during
one
of
the
busy
days
at
the
while
the
two
men
were
busy
showing
off
punch
to
the
delighted
crowd
she
took
her
grandfather
by
the
hand
and
hurriedly
slipped
away
at
first
they
pressed
forward
regardless
of
whither
their
steps
led
them
and
from
time
to
time
casting
fearful
glances
behind
them
to
see
if
they
were
being
pursued
but
as
they
drew
farther
away
they
gained
more
confidence
weariness
also
forced
them
to
slacken
their
pace
when
they
had
come
into
the
middle
of
a
little
woodland
they
rested
a
short
time
then
encountered
a
path
which
led
to
the
opposite
side
taking
their
way
along
it
for
a
short
distance
they
came
to
a
lane
so
shaded
by
the
trees
on
either
hand
that
they
met
together
overhead
and
arched
the
narrow
way
a
broken
announced
that
this
led
to
a
village
three
miles
off
and
thither
they
resolved
to
bend
their
steps
the
miles
appeared
so
long
that
they
sometimes
thought
they
must
have
missed
their
road
but
at
last
to
their
great
joy
it
led
downward
in
a
steep
descent
with
overhanging
banks
over
which
the
footpaths
led
and
the
clustered
houses
of
the
village
peeped
from
the
woody
hollow
below
it
was
a
very
small
place
the
men
and
boys
were
playing
at
cricket
on
the
green
and
as
the
other
folks
were
looking
on
they
wandered
up
and
down
uncertain
where
to
seek
a
humble
lodging
there
was
but
one
man
in
the
little
garden
before
his
cottage
and
him
they
were
timid
of
approaching
for
he
was
the
schoolmaster
and
had
school
written
up
over
his
window
in
black
letters
on
a
white
board
he
was
a
pale
man
and
sat
among
his
flowers
and
beehives
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
little
porch
before
his
door
speak
to
him
dear
the
old
man
whispered
i
am
almost
afraid
to
disturb
him
said
the
child
timidly
he
does
not
seem
to
see
us
perhaps
if
we
wait
a
little
he
may
look
this
way
but
as
nobody
else
appeared
and
it
would
soon
be
dark
nell
at
length
ventured
to
draw
near
leading
her
grandfather
by
the
hand
the
slight
noise
they
made
in
raising
the
latch
of
the
caught
his
attention
he
looked
at
them
kindly
but
seemed
disappointed
too
and
slightly
shook
his
head
nell
dropped
a
courtesy
and
told
him
they
were
poor
travellers
who
sought
a
shelter
for
the
night
which
they
would
gladly
pay
for
so
far
as
their
means
allowed
the
schoolmaster
looked
earnestly
at
her
as
she
spoke
laid
aside
his
pipe
and
rose
up
directly
if
you
could
direct
us
anywhere
sir
said
the
child
we
should
take
it
very
kindly
you
have
been
walking
a
long
way
said
the
schoolmaster
a
long
way
sir
the
child
replied
a
young
traveller
my
child
he
said
laying
his
hand
gently
on
her
head
your
grandchild
friend
aye
sir
cried
the
old
man
and
the
stay
and
comfort
of
my
life
come
in
said
the
schoolmaster
illustration
nell
and
her
grandfather
without
farther
preface
he
conducted
them
into
his
little
which
was
parlor
and
kitchen
likewise
and
told
them
they
were
welcome
to
remain
under
his
roof
till
morning
before
they
had
done
thanking
him
he
spread
a
coarse
white
cloth
upon
the
table
with
knives
and
platters
and
bringing
out
some
bread
and
cold
meat
besought
them
to
eat
they
did
so
gladly
and
the
schoolmaster
showed
them
soon
after
to
some
plain
but
neat
sleeping
chambers
up
close
under
the
thatched
roof
here
they
slept
the
sound
sleep
of
the
very
weary
and
awoke
refreshed
and
the
following
day
but
the
schoolmaster
while
kind
and
courteous
was
sad
and
quiet
he
gave
his
small
school
a
that
day
and
nell
learned
that
it
was
because
of
the
illness
of
a
favorite
boy
about
her
own
age
if
your
journey
is
not
a
long
one
he
added
to
the
travellers
very
welcome
to
pass
another
night
here
i
should
really
be
glad
if
you
would
do
so
as
i
am
very
lonely
they
accepted
and
thanked
him
with
grateful
hearts
nell
busied
herself
tidying
up
the
rooms
and
trying
in
many
little
ways
to
add
to
the
comfort
and
that
evening
when
his
pupil
died
grief
was
almost
as
deep
in
its
sympathy
as
the
own
she
bade
him
a
reluctant
farewell
the
next
morning
school
had
already
begun
but
he
rose
from
his
desk
and
walked
with
them
to
the
gate
it
was
with
a
trembling
and
reluctant
hand
that
the
child
held
out
to
him
the
money
which
a
lady
had
given
her
at
the
races
for
some
flowers
faltering
in
her
thanks
as
she
thought
how
small
the
sum
was
and
blushing
as
she
offered
it
but
he
bade
her
put
it
up
and
stooping
to
kiss
her
cheek
turned
back
into
his
house
they
had
not
gone
paces
when
he
was
at
the
door
again
the
old
man
retraced
his
steps
to
shake
hands
and
the
child
did
the
same
good
fortune
and
happiness
go
with
you
said
the
poor
schoolmaster
i
am
quite
a
solitary
man
now
if
you
ever
pass
this
way
again
not
forget
the
little
village
school
we
shall
never
forget
it
sir
rejoined
nell
nor
ever
forget
to
be
grateful
to
you
for
your
kindness
to
us
i
have
heard
such
words
from
the
lips
of
children
very
often
said
the
schoolmaster
shaking
his
head
and
smiling
thoughtfully
but
they
were
soon
forgotten
i
had
attached
one
young
friend
to
me
the
better
friend
for
being
bless
you
they
bade
him
farewell
very
many
times
and
turned
away
walking
slowly
and
often
looking
back
until
they
could
see
him
no
more
at
length
they
had
left
the
village
far
behind
and
even
lost
sight
of
the
smoke
among
the
trees
they
trudged
onward
now
at
a
quicker
pace
resolving
to
keep
the
main
road
and
go
wherever
it
might
lead
them
but
main
roads
stretch
a
long
long
way
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
inconsiderable
clusters
of
cottages
which
they
passed
without
stopping
and
one
lonely
roadside
where
they
had
some
bread
and
cheese
this
highway
had
led
them
to
in
the
still
lengthened
out
far
in
the
distance
the
same
dull
tedious
winding
course
that
they
had
been
pursuing
all
day
as
they
had
no
resource
however
but
to
go
forward
they
still
kept
on
though
at
a
much
slower
pace
being
very
weary
and
fatigued
finally
just
at
dusk
they
came
upon
a
curious
little
house
upon
travelling
show
somewhat
more
pretentious
than
the
punch
performance
they
had
run
away
from
this
little
house
was
mounted
upon
a
cart
with
white
dimity
curtains
at
the
windows
and
shutters
of
green
set
in
panels
of
bright
red
altogether
it
was
a
smart
little
contrivance
grazing
in
front
of
it
were
two
horses
while
at
its
open
door
sat
a
stout
the
tea
this
lady
jarley
by
name
had
seen
nell
and
her
grandfather
at
the
races
so
hailed
them
and
asked
about
the
success
of
the
punch
show
she
was
greatly
astonished
to
learn
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
were
wandering
about
without
any
object
in
view
her
own
performance
was
more
classic
as
she
expressed
it
it
was
a
waxwork
exhibition
and
as
she
looked
at
attractive
face
she
was
seized
with
an
idea
this
bright
little
girl
was
just
the
sort
of
assistant
she
had
been
needing
so
she
invited
them
to
stop
and
have
some
tea
with
her
they
did
so
and
when
jarley
presently
unfolded
her
was
to
engage
nell
to
exhibit
the
wax
figures
and
describe
them
in
a
set
was
delighted
to
accept
the
offer
especially
since
it
involved
no
separation
from
her
grandfather
who
could
dust
the
figures
and
do
other
light
tasks
it
was
really
not
a
very
hard
position
for
nell
at
the
first
town
where
the
waxworks
were
to
be
shown
nell
was
given
a
private
view
and
instructed
in
her
new
duties
the
figures
were
displayed
on
a
raised
platform
some
two
feet
from
the
floor
running
round
the
room
and
parted
from
the
rude
public
by
a
crimson
rope
breast
high
they
represented
celebrated
characters
singly
and
in
groups
clad
in
glittering
dresses
of
various
climes
and
times
and
standing
more
or
less
unsteadily
upon
their
legs
with
their
eyes
very
wide
open
and
their
nostrils
very
much
inflated
and
the
muscles
of
their
legs
and
arms
very
strongly
developed
and
all
their
countenances
expressing
great
surprise
all
the
gentlemen
were
very
and
very
blue
about
the
beards
and
all
the
ladies
were
miraculous
figures
and
all
the
ladies
and
all
the
gentlemen
were
looking
with
extraordinary
earnestness
at
nothing
at
all
nell
was
taught
a
little
speech
about
each
one
of
them
and
so
apt
was
she
that
one
rehearsal
rendered
her
able
to
take
the
willow
wand
which
jarley
had
formerly
wielded
and
tell
the
interesting
history
of
this
very
select
waxwork
show
to
the
audiences
which
presently
began
to
come
jarley
herself
was
delighted
with
her
venture
she
saw
at
once
that
nell
would
be
a
strong
drawing
card
and
in
order
that
the
child
might
remain
contented
she
made
her
and
her
grandfather
as
comfortable
as
possible
besides
paying
them
a
fair
salary
so
the
wanderers
now
rode
in
the
van
from
town
to
town
and
lived
almost
happily
nell
carefully
saved
all
their
money
and
watched
over
her
feeble
grandfather
with
the
tenderness
of
a
little
mother
she
had
one
scare
in
almost
meeting
face
to
face
with
quilp
the
dwarf
but
he
had
not
recognized
her
quilp
indeed
was
a
perpetual
nightmare
to
the
child
who
was
constantly
haunted
by
a
vision
of
his
ugly
face
and
stunted
figure
she
slept
for
their
better
security
in
the
room
where
the
waxwork
figures
were
and
she
never
retired
to
this
place
at
night
but
she
tortured
could
not
help
imagining
a
resemblance
in
some
one
or
other
of
their
faces
to
the
dwarf
and
this
fancy
would
sometimes
so
gain
upon
her
that
she
would
almost
believe
he
had
removed
the
figure
and
stood
within
the
clothes
but
presently
a
deeper
and
more
real
concern
came
to
her
her
grandfather
had
never
alluded
to
their
former
life
nor
to
his
passion
for
gambling
he
did
not
see
the
out
in
the
country
and
that
was
the
reason
why
she
had
been
so
eager
to
wander
even
without
a
roof
over
their
heads
but
now
as
the
waxworks
exhibited
only
in
the
towns
temptation
came
again
to
the
poor
weak
old
man
he
saw
some
men
playing
cards
in
a
tavern
and
instantly
his
slumbering
passion
was
aroused
he
would
play
again
and
win
a
great
nell
he
began
to
play
and
of
course
with
the
old
result
he
was
but
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
the
sharpers
and
presently
he
had
exhausted
all
the
slender
hoard
which
nell
had
so
carefully
made
she
watched
his
actions
with
a
bursting
heart
but
was
powerless
to
stop
him
or
keep
the
money
out
of
his
grasp
at
last
the
villains
who
had
led
him
satisfied
with
their
small
winnings
from
him
to
get
the
money
belonging
to
the
waxwork
show
saying
that
when
he
won
he
could
pay
it
all
back
nell
had
followed
her
grandfather
upon
this
visit
to
the
gamblers
and
overheard
their
plot
she
knew
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
to
save
her
grandfather
they
must
flee
out
into
the
world
again
at
once
that
night
she
roused
him
from
his
sleep
and
told
him
they
must
go
away
what
does
this
mean
he
cried
i
have
had
dreadful
dreams
said
the
child
if
we
stay
here
another
night
something
awful
will
happen
come
the
old
man
looked
at
her
as
if
she
were
a
spirit
and
trembled
in
every
joint
must
we
go
he
asked
yes
she
replied
night
will
be
too
late
the
dream
will
have
come
again
nothing
but
flight
can
save
us
up
the
old
man
rose
obediently
and
made
ready
to
follow
she
had
already
packed
their
scanty
belongings
she
gave
him
his
wallet
and
staff
and
secretly
in
the
night
they
fled
away
the
wanderings
of
the
next
few
days
seemed
like
a
nightmare
to
them
nell
had
brought
only
a
few
pennies
in
her
pockets
and
these
went
for
a
scant
supply
of
bread
and
cheese
two
days
and
a
night
they
rode
on
an
open
in
company
with
some
rough
but
not
unkind
men
it
was
easier
than
walking
but
the
rain
descended
in
torrents
and
drenched
them
to
the
skin
finally
the
boat
drew
up
to
a
wharf
in
an
ugly
manufacturing
town
and
the
travellers
were
cast
adrift
as
lonely
and
helpless
as
though
they
had
just
awakened
from
a
sleep
of
a
thousand
years
they
had
not
one
friend
nor
the
least
idea
where
to
turn
for
shelter
but
a
rough
stoker
at
one
of
the
furnaces
told
them
that
they
might
pass
the
night
in
front
of
his
fire
it
was
nothing
but
a
bed
of
ashes
yet
they
were
warm
and
the
heat
dried
out
the
poor
drenched
garments
the
child
felt
stiff
and
weak
in
every
joint
the
next
morning
but
the
told
them
that
it
was
two
journey
to
the
open
country
and
sweet
pure
fields
and
she
felt
that
they
must
press
forward
at
any
cost
so
they
started
forth
slowly
and
wearily
for
their
journey
and
privations
had
almost
exhausted
them
but
still
with
brave
hearts
through
long
rows
of
red
brick
houses
that
looked
exactly
alike
they
wended
their
way
asking
for
bread
to
eat
only
when
obliged
to
and
meeting
little
else
but
scowls
from
the
dirty
factory
workers
finally
to
their
great
joy
the
open
country
began
again
to
appear
and
with
fresh
courage
in
their
hearts
they
continued
to
press
on
they
were
dragging
themselves
along
through
the
last
street
and
the
child
felt
that
the
time
was
close
at
hand
when
her
enfeebled
powers
would
bear
no
more
when
there
appeared
before
them
going
in
the
same
direction
as
themselves
a
traveller
on
foot
who
with
a
portmanteau
strapped
to
his
back
leaned
upon
a
stout
stick
as
he
walked
and
read
from
a
book
which
he
held
in
his
other
hand
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
to
come
up
with
him
and
beseech
his
aid
for
he
walked
fast
and
was
a
little
distance
in
advance
at
length
he
stopped
to
look
more
attentively
at
some
passage
in
his
book
animated
with
a
ray
of
hope
the
child
shot
on
before
her
grandfather
and
going
close
to
the
stranger
without
rousing
him
by
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
began
in
a
few
faint
words
to
implore
his
help
he
turned
his
head
the
child
clapped
her
hands
together
uttered
a
wild
shriek
and
fell
senseless
at
his
feet
at
the
end
of
the
it
was
the
poor
schoolmaster
scarcely
less
moved
and
surprised
by
the
sight
of
the
child
than
she
had
been
on
recognizing
him
he
stood
for
a
moment
without
even
the
presence
of
mind
to
raise
her
from
the
ground
but
quickly
recovering
his
he
threw
down
his
stick
and
book
and
dropping
on
one
knee
beside
her
endeavored
by
such
simple
means
as
occurred
to
him
to
restore
her
to
herself
while
her
grandfather
standing
idly
by
wrung
his
hands
and
implored
her
with
many
endearing
expressions
to
speak
to
him
were
it
only
a
word
she
is
quite
exhausted
said
the
schoolmaster
glancing
upward
into
his
face
you
have
taxed
her
powers
too
far
friend
she
is
perishing
of
want
rejoined
the
old
man
i
never
thought
how
weak
and
ill
she
was
till
now
casting
a
look
upon
him
half
reproachful
and
half
compassionate
the
schoolmaster
took
the
child
in
his
arms
and
bidding
the
old
man
gather
up
her
little
basket
and
follow
him
directly
bore
her
away
at
his
utmost
speed
there
was
a
small
inn
within
sight
to
which
it
would
seem
he
had
been
directing
his
steps
when
so
unexpectedly
overtaken
towards
this
place
he
hurried
with
his
unconscious
burden
and
rushing
into
the
kitchen
deposited
it
on
a
chair
before
the
fire
a
doctor
was
hastily
called
in
and
restoratives
were
applied
after
which
nell
was
given
what
she
most
needed
some
warm
broth
and
toast
and
was
put
to
bed
the
schoolmaster
asked
anxiously
after
her
health
the
next
morning
and
was
greatly
relieved
to
find
that
she
was
much
better
though
still
so
weak
that
it
would
require
a
careful
nursing
before
she
could
proceed
upon
her
journey
that
evening
he
was
allowed
to
see
her
and
was
greatly
touched
by
the
sight
of
her
pale
pinched
face
but
she
held
out
both
hands
to
him
it
makes
me
unhappy
even
in
the
midst
of
all
this
kindness
said
the
child
to
think
that
we
should
be
a
burden
upon
you
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
if
i
had
not
met
you
so
far
from
home
i
must
have
died
and
poor
grandfather
would
have
no
one
to
take
care
of
him
not
talk
about
dying
said
the
schoolmaster
and
as
to
burdens
i
have
made
my
fortune
since
you
slept
at
my
cottage
indeed
cried
the
child
joyfully
oh
yes
returned
her
friend
i
have
been
appointed
clerk
and
schoolmaster
to
a
village
a
long
way
from
a
long
way
from
the
old
one
as
you
may
pounds
a
year
pounds
about
i
am
very
glad
said
the
so
very
very
glad
i
am
on
my
way
there
now
resumed
the
schoolmaster
they
allowed
me
the
stagecoach
hire
all
the
way
bless
you
they
grudge
me
nothing
but
as
the
time
at
which
i
am
expected
there
left
me
ample
leisure
i
determined
to
walk
instead
how
glad
i
am
to
think
i
did
so
how
glad
should
we
be
yes
yes
said
the
schoolmaster
moving
restlessly
in
his
chair
certainly
very
true
but
are
you
going
where
are
you
coming
from
what
have
you
been
doing
since
you
left
me
what
had
you
been
doing
before
now
tell
tell
me
i
know
very
little
of
the
world
and
perhaps
you
are
better
fitted
to
advise
me
in
its
affairs
than
i
am
qualified
to
give
advice
to
you
but
i
am
very
sincere
and
i
have
a
reason
you
have
not
forgotten
it
for
loving
you
i
have
felt
since
that
time
as
if
my
love
for
him
who
died
had
been
transferred
to
you
nell
was
moved
in
her
turn
by
this
allusion
to
the
favorite
pupil
who
had
died
and
by
the
plain
frank
kindness
of
the
good
schoolmaster
she
told
him
they
had
no
friend
or
she
had
fled
with
the
old
man
to
save
him
from
all
the
miseries
he
she
was
flying
now
to
save
him
from
that
she
sought
an
asylum
in
some
quiet
place
where
the
temptation
before
which
he
fell
would
never
enter
and
her
late
sorrows
and
distresses
could
have
no
place
the
schoolmaster
heard
her
with
astonishment
this
child
he
thought
she
is
one
of
the
heroines
and
saints
of
earth
then
he
told
her
of
a
great
idea
which
had
occurred
to
him
they
were
all
three
to
travel
together
to
the
village
where
his
new
school
was
located
and
he
made
no
doubt
he
could
find
them
some
simple
and
congenial
employment
the
child
joyfully
accepted
this
and
the
journey
was
made
very
comfortably
in
a
stage
which
went
that
way
stowed
among
the
softer
bundles
and
packages
she
thought
this
to
be
a
drowsy
luxurious
way
of
going
indeed
at
last
they
came
upon
a
quiet
hamlet
clustered
in
a
valley
among
some
stately
trees
the
church
cried
the
delighted
schoolmaster
in
a
low
voice
and
that
old
building
close
beside
it
is
the
schoolhouse
be
sworn
pounds
a
year
in
this
beautiful
place
they
admired
old
gray
porch
the
green
churchyard
the
ancient
tower
the
very
weathercock
the
brown
thatched
roofs
of
cottage
barn
and
homestead
peeping
from
among
the
trees
the
stream
that
rippled
by
the
distant
watermill
the
blue
welsh
mountains
far
away
it
was
for
such
a
spot
the
child
had
wearied
in
the
dense
dark
miserable
haunts
of
labor
upon
her
bed
of
ashes
and
amidst
the
squalid
horrors
through
which
they
had
forced
their
way
visions
of
such
indeed
but
not
more
beautiful
than
this
sweet
been
always
present
to
her
mind
they
had
seemed
to
melt
into
a
dim
and
airy
distance
as
the
prospect
of
ever
beholding
them
again
grew
fainter
but
as
they
receded
she
had
loved
and
panted
for
them
more
i
must
leave
you
somewhere
for
a
few
minutes
said
the
schoolmaster
at
length
breaking
the
silence
into
which
they
had
fallen
in
their
gladness
i
have
a
letter
to
present
and
inquiries
to
make
you
know
where
shall
i
take
you
to
the
little
inn
yonder
let
us
wait
here
rejoined
nell
the
gate
is
open
we
will
sit
in
the
church
porch
till
you
come
back
a
good
place
too
said
the
schoolmaster
leading
the
way
towards
it
be
sure
that
i
come
back
with
good
news
and
am
not
long
gone
so
the
happy
schoolmaster
put
on
a
pair
of
gloves
which
he
had
carried
in
a
little
parcel
in
his
pocket
all
the
way
and
hurried
off
full
of
ardor
and
excitement
the
child
watched
him
from
the
porch
until
the
intervening
foliage
hid
him
from
her
view
and
then
stepped
softly
out
into
the
old
solemn
and
quiet
that
every
rustle
of
her
dress
upon
the
fallen
leaves
which
strewed
the
path
and
made
her
footsteps
noiseless
seemed
an
invasion
of
its
silence
it
was
an
aged
ghostly
place
the
church
had
been
built
hundreds
of
years
before
yet
from
this
first
glimpse
the
child
loved
it
and
felt
that
in
some
strange
way
she
was
a
part
of
its
crumbling
walls
and
churchyard
after
a
time
the
schoolmaster
reappeared
hurrying
towards
them
and
swinging
a
bunch
of
keys
you
see
those
two
houses
he
asked
pointing
quite
out
of
breath
well
one
of
them
is
mine
without
saying
any
more
or
giving
the
child
time
to
reply
the
schoolmaster
took
her
hand
and
his
honest
face
quite
radiant
with
exultation
led
her
to
the
place
of
which
he
spoke
they
stopped
before
its
low
arched
door
after
trying
several
of
the
keys
in
vain
the
schoolmaster
found
one
to
fit
the
huge
lock
which
turned
back
creaking
and
admitted
them
into
the
house
it
was
a
very
old
house
and
like
the
church
falling
into
decay
yet
still
handsome
with
high
vaulted
ceilings
and
queer
carvings
it
was
not
quite
destitute
of
furniture
a
few
strange
chairs
whose
arms
and
legs
looked
as
though
they
had
dwindled
away
with
age
a
table
the
very
spectre
of
its
race
a
great
old
chest
that
had
once
held
records
in
the
church
with
other
quaintly
fashioned
domestic
necessaries
and
store
of
firewood
for
the
winter
were
scattered
around
and
gave
evident
tokens
of
its
occupation
as
a
at
no
very
distant
time
the
child
looked
around
her
with
that
solemn
feeling
with
which
we
contemplate
the
work
of
ages
that
have
become
but
drops
of
water
in
the
great
ocean
of
eternity
the
old
man
had
followed
them
but
they
were
all
three
hushed
for
a
space
and
drew
their
breath
softly
as
if
they
feared
to
break
the
silence
even
by
so
slight
a
sound
it
is
a
very
beautiful
place
said
the
child
in
a
low
voice
i
almost
feared
you
thought
otherwise
returned
the
schoolmaster
you
shivered
when
we
first
came
in
as
if
you
felt
it
cold
or
gloomy
it
was
not
that
said
nell
glancing
round
with
a
slight
shudder
indeed
i
can
not
tell
you
what
it
was
but
when
i
saw
the
outside
from
the
church
porch
the
same
feeling
came
over
me
it
is
its
being
so
old
and
gray
perhaps
a
peaceful
place
to
live
in
you
think
so
said
her
friend
oh
yes
rejoined
the
child
clasping
her
hands
earnestly
a
quiet
happy
place
to
live
and
learn
to
die
in
a
place
to
live
and
learn
to
live
and
gather
health
of
mind
and
body
in
said
the
schoolmaster
for
this
old
house
is
yours
ours
cried
the
child
aye
returned
the
schoolmaster
gaily
for
many
a
merry
year
to
come
i
hope
i
shall
be
a
close
next
this
house
is
yours
having
now
disburdened
himself
of
his
great
surprise
the
schoolmaster
sat
down
and
drawing
nell
to
his
side
told
her
how
he
had
learned
that
the
ancient
tenement
had
been
occupied
for
a
very
long
time
by
an
old
person
who
kept
the
keys
of
the
church
opened
and
closed
it
for
the
services
and
showed
it
to
strangers
how
she
had
died
not
many
weeks
ago
and
nobody
had
yet
been
found
to
fill
the
office
how
learning
all
this
in
an
interview
with
the
sexton
he
had
hurried
to
the
clergyman
and
obtained
the
vacant
post
for
nell
and
her
grandfather
a
small
allowance
of
money
said
the
schoolmaster
it
is
not
much
but
still
enough
to
live
upon
in
this
retired
spot
by
clubbing
our
funds
together
we
shall
do
bravely
no
fear
of
that
heaven
bless
and
prosper
you
sobbed
the
child
amen
my
dear
returned
her
friend
cheerfully
and
all
of
us
as
it
will
and
has
in
leading
us
through
sorrow
and
trouble
to
this
tranquil
life
but
we
must
look
at
my
house
now
come
they
repaired
to
the
other
tenement
tried
the
rusty
keys
as
before
at
length
found
the
right
one
and
opened
the
door
it
led
into
a
chamber
vaulted
and
old
like
that
from
which
they
had
come
but
not
so
spacious
and
having
only
one
other
little
room
attached
it
was
not
difficult
to
divine
that
the
other
house
was
of
right
the
and
that
he
had
chosen
for
himself
the
least
commodious
in
his
care
and
regard
for
them
like
the
adjoining
habitation
it
held
such
old
articles
of
furniture
as
were
absolutely
necessary
and
had
its
stack
of
firewood
to
make
these
dwellings
as
habitable
and
full
of
comfort
as
they
could
was
now
their
pleasant
care
in
a
short
time
each
had
its
cheerful
fire
glowing
and
crackling
on
the
hearth
and
reddening
the
pale
old
walls
with
a
hale
and
healthy
blush
nell
busily
plying
her
needle
repaired
the
tattered
drew
together
the
rents
that
time
had
worn
in
the
threadbare
scraps
of
carpet
and
made
them
whole
and
decent
the
schoolmaster
swept
and
smoothed
the
ground
before
the
door
trimmed
the
long
grass
trained
the
ivy
and
creeping
plants
which
hung
their
drooping
heads
in
melancholy
neglect
and
gave
to
the
outer
walls
a
cheery
air
of
home
the
old
man
sometimes
by
his
side
and
sometimes
with
the
child
lent
his
aid
to
both
went
here
and
there
on
little
patient
services
and
was
happy
neighbors
too
as
they
came
from
work
proffered
their
help
or
sent
their
children
with
such
small
presents
or
loans
as
the
strangers
needed
most
so
it
was
not
many
days
before
they
were
quite
cosy
and
nell
felt
again
in
that
strange
way
which
had
come
over
her
at
the
church
that
she
had
always
been
a
part
of
the
place
and
how
she
loved
her
work
from
the
very
first
hour
after
hour
she
would
spend
in
the
old
church
dusting
off
its
pews
or
casements
with
reverent
fingers
or
more
often
sitting
quietly
before
some
tablet
or
inscription
looking
at
it
or
beyond
it
with
a
dreamy
light
in
her
eyes
her
grandfather
noted
her
attitude
anxiously
he
saw
that
she
grew
more
listless
and
frail
day
by
day
and
he
sought
old
man
lighten
her
few
tasks
but
it
was
not
these
which
wearied
her
it
was
merely
the
burden
of
all
things
earthly
every
person
in
the
village
soon
grew
to
love
this
frail
child
but
from
the
first
she
seemed
a
being
apart
from
them
they
were
constantly
showing
her
kindness
or
pausing
at
the
church
gate
to
speak
with
her
but
as
they
went
their
way
a
sad
smile
or
shake
of
the
head
told
only
too
plainly
of
their
fears
she
was
like
some
rare
delicate
flower
which
they
knew
could
not
endure
the
frost
of
winter
the
good
schoolmaster
gently
chided
her
for
spending
so
much
of
her
time
in
the
church
and
among
the
graves
instead
of
out
in
the
light
and
sunshine
but
she
only
smiled
and
said
she
loved
to
tend
the
graves
and
keep
them
neat
for
she
could
not
bear
to
think
that
any
lying
there
should
be
forgotten
or
that
she
herself
might
be
forgotten
some
day
there
is
nothing
good
that
is
forgotten
he
replied
kindly
there
is
not
an
angel
added
to
the
host
of
heaven
but
does
its
blessed
work
on
earth
in
those
that
loved
it
here
as
the
cold
days
of
autumn
and
winter
drew
on
the
child
spent
more
and
more
time
within
doors
on
a
couch
before
the
fire
the
slightest
task
wearied
her
now
and
her
grandfather
kept
watch
night
and
day
to
save
her
needless
steps
he
could
scarcely
bear
her
out
of
his
sight
and
often
would
creep
to
the
side
of
her
couch
during
the
night
listening
to
her
breathing
or
stroking
her
slender
fingers
softly
and
if
by
chance
she
awoke
and
smiled
on
him
he
would
creep
back
to
his
own
bed
comforted
but
one
chill
morning
in
midwinter
when
the
snow
lay
thickly
on
the
ground
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
slept
more
quietly
than
usual
the
schoolmaster
coming
in
found
him
crouched
over
a
fire
muttering
softly
to
himself
and
wondering
why
she
slumbered
so
long
the
two
went
softly
into
her
chamber
and
then
the
schoolmaster
knew
why
she
was
so
quiet
for
she
was
dead
dear
gentle
patient
noble
nell
was
dead
no
sleep
so
beautiful
and
calm
so
free
from
trace
of
pain
so
fair
to
look
upon
she
seemed
a
creature
fresh
from
the
hand
of
god
and
waiting
the
breath
of
life
not
one
who
had
lived
and
suffered
death
the
old
man
held
one
languid
arm
in
his
and
had
the
small
hand
tight
folded
to
his
breast
for
warmth
it
was
the
hand
she
had
stretched
out
to
him
with
her
last
hand
that
had
led
him
on
through
all
their
wanderings
ever
and
anon
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
then
hugged
it
to
his
breast
again
murmuring
that
it
was
warmer
now
and
as
he
said
it
he
looked
in
agony
to
the
schoolmaster
as
if
imploring
him
to
help
her
she
was
dead
and
past
all
help
or
need
of
it
the
ancient
rooms
she
had
seemed
to
fill
with
life
even
while
her
own
was
waning
fast
the
garden
she
had
tended
the
eyes
she
had
gladdened
the
noiseless
haunts
of
many
a
thoughtful
hour
the
paths
she
had
trodden
as
it
were
but
know
her
nevermore
it
is
not
said
the
schoolmaster
as
he
bent
down
to
kiss
her
on
the
cheek
and
gave
his
tears
free
vent
it
is
not
on
earth
that
justice
ends
think
what
earth
is
compared
with
the
world
to
which
her
young
spirit
has
winged
its
early
flight
and
say
if
one
deliberate
wish
expressed
in
solemn
terms
above
this
bed
could
call
her
back
to
life
which
of
us
would
utter
it
the
whole
village
young
and
old
came
to
the
churchyard
when
they
laid
her
to
only
the
old
man
he
could
not
realize
that
she
was
dead
and
he
had
gone
to
pick
winter
berries
to
decorate
her
couch
when
he
returned
and
could
not
find
her
they
were
obliged
to
tell
him
the
her
body
had
been
put
away
in
the
cold
then
his
grief
and
distress
were
pitiful
to
see
he
seemed
at
once
to
lose
all
power
of
thought
or
action
save
as
they
concerned
her
alone
day
by
day
he
sought
for
her
about
the
house
or
in
the
garden
calling
her
name
wildly
at
other
times
he
sat
before
the
fire
staring
dully
and
did
not
seem
to
hear
when
they
spoke
to
him
at
length
they
found
one
day
that
he
had
risen
early
and
with
his
knapsack
on
his
back
his
staff
in
hand
her
own
straw
hat
and
little
basket
full
of
such
things
as
she
had
been
used
to
carry
was
gone
as
they
were
making
ready
to
pursue
him
far
and
wide
a
frightened
schoolboy
came
who
had
seen
him
but
a
moment
before
sitting
in
the
her
grave
he
said
they
hastened
there
and
going
softly
to
the
door
espied
him
in
the
attitude
of
one
who
waited
patiently
they
did
not
disturb
him
then
but
kept
a
watch
upon
him
all
that
day
when
it
grew
quite
dark
he
rose
and
returned
home
and
went
to
bed
murmuring
to
himself
she
will
come
upon
the
morrow
he
was
there
again
from
sunrise
until
night
and
still
at
night
he
laid
him
down
to
rest
and
murmured
she
will
come
and
thenceforth
every
day
and
all
day
long
he
waited
at
her
grave
for
her
how
many
pictures
of
new
journeys
over
pleasant
country
of
under
the
free
broad
sky
of
rambles
in
the
fields
and
woods
and
paths
not
often
trodden
how
many
tones
of
that
one
voice
how
many
glimpses
of
the
form
the
fluttering
dress
the
hair
that
waved
so
gaily
in
the
wind
how
many
visions
of
what
had
been
and
what
he
hoped
was
yet
to
up
before
him
in
the
old
dull
silent
church
he
never
told
them
what
he
thought
or
where
he
went
he
would
sit
with
them
at
night
pondering
with
a
secret
satisfaction
they
could
see
upon
the
flight
that
he
and
she
would
take
before
night
came
again
and
still
they
would
hear
him
whisper
in
his
prayers
lord
let
her
come
the
last
time
was
on
a
genial
day
in
spring
he
did
not
return
at
the
usual
hour
and
they
went
to
seek
him
he
was
lying
dead
upon
the
stone
they
laid
him
by
the
side
of
her
whom
he
had
loved
so
well
and
in
the
church
where
they
had
often
prayed
and
mused
and
lingered
hand
in
hand
the
child
and
the
old
man
slept
together
story
of
paul
and
florence
the
house
of
dombey
and
paul
dombey
was
a
boy
born
to
achieve
great
things
his
birth
was
the
one
historic
event
of
the
dombey
least
so
his
father
said
is
true
that
sister
florence
was
six
years
older
than
he
but
then
florence
was
only
a
girl
what
dombey
had
long
wanted
was
a
son
who
could
grow
up
to
carry
on
the
business
of
the
great
export
house
and
who
from
his
birth
would
make
possible
the
imposing
title
of
dombey
and
son
so
florence
who
had
remained
quietly
neglected
in
her
nursery
now
came
into
notice
only
as
the
sister
of
paul
or
as
a
faithful
little
nurse
who
could
help
amuse
him
as
for
dombey
himself
he
was
a
cold
haughty
man
very
proud
of
what
he
had
done
and
at
all
times
exacting
obedience
from
every
one
else
mother
had
died
soon
after
he
was
born
and
dombey
having
engaged
the
best
nurses
he
could
find
expected
them
forthwith
to
bring
the
child
through
all
the
round
of
infant
which
the
frail
little
fellow
had
more
than
his
full
share
indeed
dombey
loved
his
son
with
all
the
love
he
had
if
there
were
a
warm
place
in
his
frosty
heart
his
son
occupied
it
though
not
so
much
as
an
infant
or
a
boy
as
a
prospective
son
of
the
firm
therefore
he
was
impatient
to
have
him
grow
up
feeling
as
if
the
boy
had
a
charmed
life
and
must
become
the
man
around
whom
all
his
hopes
centred
thus
paul
grew
to
be
nearly
five
years
old
he
was
a
pretty
little
fellow
though
there
was
something
wan
and
wistful
in
his
small
face
that
gave
occasion
to
many
significant
shakes
of
his
head
his
temper
gave
abundant
promise
of
being
imperious
like
his
in
after
life
he
was
childish
and
sportive
enough
at
times
but
he
had
a
strange
thoughtful
way
at
other
times
of
sitting
brooding
in
his
miniature
when
he
looked
and
talked
like
one
of
those
terrible
little
beings
in
the
fairy
tales
who
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
years
of
age
fantastically
represent
the
children
for
whom
they
have
been
substituted
he
would
frequently
be
stricken
with
this
mood
upstairs
in
the
nursery
and
would
sometimes
lapse
into
it
suddenly
exclaiming
that
he
was
tired
even
while
playing
with
florence
or
driving
his
nurse
in
single
harness
but
at
no
one
time
did
he
fall
into
it
so
surely
as
when
his
little
chair
being
carried
down
into
his
room
he
sat
there
with
him
after
dinner
by
the
fire
they
were
the
strangest
pair
at
such
a
time
that
ever
firelight
shone
upon
dombey
so
erect
and
solemn
gazing
at
the
blaze
his
little
image
with
an
old
old
face
peering
into
the
red
perspective
with
the
fixed
and
rapt
attention
of
a
sage
the
two
so
very
much
alike
and
yet
so
monstrously
contrasted
on
one
of
these
occasions
when
they
had
both
been
perfectly
quiet
for
a
long
time
little
paul
broke
the
silence
thus
papa
money
the
abrupt
question
had
such
immediate
reference
to
the
subject
of
thoughts
that
dombey
was
quite
disconcerted
what
is
money
paul
he
answered
money
yes
said
the
child
laying
his
hands
upon
the
elbows
of
his
little
chair
and
turning
the
old
face
up
towards
what
is
money
dombey
was
in
a
difficulty
he
would
have
liked
to
give
him
some
explanation
but
looking
down
at
the
little
chair
and
seeing
what
a
long
way
down
it
was
he
answered
gold
and
silver
and
copper
guineas
shillings
halfpence
you
know
what
they
are
oh
yes
i
know
what
they
are
said
paul
i
mean
that
papa
i
mean
money
after
all
what
is
money
after
all
said
dombey
backing
his
chair
a
little
that
he
might
the
better
gaze
at
the
atom
that
made
such
an
inquiry
i
mean
papa
what
can
it
do
returned
paul
dombey
drew
his
chair
back
to
its
former
place
and
patted
him
on
the
head
know
better
by
and
by
my
man
he
said
money
paul
can
do
anything
anything
papa
yes
said
dombey
anything
means
everything
it
papa
asked
his
son
not
observing
or
possibly
not
understanding
the
qualification
yes
said
dombey
why
money
save
me
my
mamma
returned
the
child
it
cruel
is
it
cruel
said
dombey
settling
his
neckcloth
and
seeming
to
resent
the
idea
no
a
good
thing
be
cruel
if
a
good
thing
and
can
do
anything
said
the
little
fellow
thoughtfully
as
he
looked
back
at
the
fire
i
wonder
why
it
save
me
my
mamma
dombey
having
recovered
from
his
surprise
not
to
say
his
alarm
for
it
was
the
very
first
occasion
on
which
the
child
had
ever
broached
the
subject
of
his
mother
to
him
expounded
to
him
how
that
money
though
a
very
potent
spirit
could
not
keep
people
alive
whose
time
was
come
to
die
and
how
that
we
must
all
die
unfortunately
even
in
the
city
though
we
were
never
so
rich
paul
listened
to
all
this
and
much
more
with
grave
attention
and
then
suddenly
asked
a
question
which
was
still
more
alarming
it
make
me
strong
and
quite
well
either
papa
can
it
why
you
strong
and
quite
well
returned
dombey
are
you
not
oh
the
age
of
the
face
that
was
turned
up
again
with
an
expression
half
of
melancholy
half
of
slyness
on
it
you
are
as
strong
and
well
as
such
little
people
usually
are
eh
said
dombey
florence
is
older
than
i
am
but
not
as
strong
and
well
as
florence
i
know
returned
the
child
but
i
believe
that
when
florence
was
as
little
as
me
she
could
play
a
great
deal
longer
at
a
time
without
tiring
herself
i
am
so
tired
sometimes
that
i
know
what
to
do
but
at
night
said
dombey
drawing
his
own
chair
closer
to
his
and
laying
his
hand
gently
on
his
back
little
people
should
be
tired
at
night
for
then
they
sleep
well
oh
not
at
night
papa
returned
the
child
in
the
day
and
i
lie
down
in
lap
and
she
sings
to
me
at
night
i
dream
about
such
things
dombey
was
so
astonished
and
so
perfectly
at
a
loss
how
to
pursue
the
conversation
that
he
could
only
sit
looking
at
his
son
by
the
light
of
the
fire
here
they
sat
until
florence
came
timidly
into
the
room
to
take
paul
upstairs
to
bed
when
he
raised
towards
his
father
in
bidding
him
a
countenance
so
much
brighter
so
much
younger
and
so
much
more
childlike
altogether
that
dombey
while
he
felt
greatly
reassured
by
the
change
was
quite
amazed
at
it
after
they
had
left
the
room
together
he
thought
he
heard
a
soft
voice
singing
and
remembering
that
paul
had
said
his
sister
sang
to
him
he
had
the
curiosity
to
open
the
door
and
listen
and
look
after
them
she
was
toiling
up
the
great
wide
staircase
with
him
in
her
arms
his
head
was
lying
on
her
shoulder
one
of
his
arms
thrown
negligently
round
her
neck
so
they
went
toiling
up
she
singing
all
the
way
and
paul
sometimes
crooning
out
a
feeble
accompaniment
dombey
was
so
alarmed
about
remarks
as
to
his
health
that
he
called
the
family
doctor
in
consultation
the
very
next
day
the
doctor
admitted
that
paul
was
not
as
strong
as
he
could
hope
and
suggested
that
sea
air
might
benefit
him
so
the
boy
was
sent
to
the
home
of
a
pipchin
at
brighton
but
he
refused
to
go
without
florence
much
to
the
secret
displeasure
of
dombey
who
did
not
like
to
see
any
this
neglected
more
influence
with
paul
than
he
himself
had
pipchin
was
a
old
lady
who
gained
a
livelihood
by
taking
care
of
delicate
children
but
she
was
not
unkind
to
paul
whose
patient
little
face
and
strange
way
of
asking
questions
attracted
her
as
they
did
everybody
else
when
he
had
been
with
her
for
some
time
and
it
was
found
that
he
did
not
gain
in
strength
a
little
carriage
was
hired
for
him
in
which
he
could
lie
at
his
ease
with
his
books
and
be
wheeled
down
to
the
seaside
consistent
in
his
odd
tastes
the
child
set
aside
a
lad
who
was
proposed
as
the
drawer
of
this
carriage
and
selected
instead
the
weazen
old
man
in
a
suit
of
battered
oilskin
with
this
attendant
to
pull
him
along
and
florence
always
walking
by
his
side
he
went
down
to
the
margin
of
the
ocean
every
day
and
there
he
would
sit
or
lie
in
his
carriage
for
hours
together
never
so
distressed
as
by
the
company
of
alone
excepted
always
some
small
voice
near
his
ear
would
ask
him
how
he
was
perhaps
i
am
very
well
i
thank
you
he
would
answer
but
you
had
better
go
and
play
if
you
please
then
he
would
turn
his
head
and
watch
the
child
away
and
say
to
florence
we
want
any
others
do
we
kiss
me
floy
his
favorite
spot
was
quite
a
lonely
one
far
away
from
most
loungers
and
with
florence
sitting
by
his
side
at
work
or
reading
to
him
or
talking
to
him
and
the
wind
blowing
on
his
face
and
the
water
coming
up
among
the
wheels
of
his
bed
he
wanted
nothing
more
floy
he
said
one
day
india
oh
a
long
long
distance
off
said
florence
raising
her
eyes
from
her
work
weeks
off
asked
paul
yes
dear
many
journey
night
and
day
if
you
were
in
india
floy
said
paul
after
being
silent
for
a
minute
i
is
it
that
mamma
did
i
forget
loved
me
answered
florence
no
no
i
love
you
now
floy
what
is
it
if
you
were
in
india
i
should
die
floy
she
hurriedly
put
her
work
aside
and
laid
her
head
down
on
his
pillow
caressing
him
and
so
would
she
she
said
if
he
were
there
he
would
be
better
soon
oh
i
am
a
great
deal
better
now
he
answered
i
mean
that
i
mean
that
i
should
die
of
being
so
sorry
and
so
lonely
floy
another
time
in
the
same
place
he
fell
asleep
and
slept
quietly
for
a
long
time
awaking
suddenly
he
started
up
and
sat
listening
florence
asked
him
what
he
thought
he
heard
i
want
to
know
what
it
says
he
answered
looking
steadily
in
her
face
the
sea
floy
what
is
it
that
it
keeps
on
saying
she
told
him
that
it
was
only
the
noise
of
the
rolling
waves
yes
yes
he
said
but
i
know
that
they
are
always
saying
something
always
the
same
thing
what
place
is
over
there
he
rose
up
looking
eagerly
at
the
horizon
she
told
him
that
there
was
another
country
opposite
but
he
said
he
mean
that
he
meant
farther
away
very
often
afterwards
in
the
midst
of
their
talk
he
would
break
off
to
try
to
understand
what
it
was
that
the
waves
were
always
saying
and
would
rise
up
in
his
couch
to
look
towards
that
invisible
region
far
away
but
in
spite
of
brooding
fancies
the
days
in
the
open
air
and
with
the
salt
spray
blowing
about
him
began
to
have
good
effect
little
by
little
he
grew
stronger
until
he
became
able
to
do
without
his
carriage
though
he
still
remained
the
same
old
quiet
dreamy
child
one
day
after
he
had
been
with
pipchin
about
a
year
dombey
came
to
see
her
he
informed
pipchin
that
as
paul
was
now
six
years
old
and
so
much
stronger
it
was
time
his
education
was
being
considered
and
so
the
child
was
to
be
sent
to
a
certain
blimber
who
lived
near
by
and
managed
a
select
school
of
boys
meanwhile
florence
could
continue
to
live
here
so
that
paul
need
not
be
entirely
separated
from
his
sister
accordingly
a
few
days
later
paul
stood
upon
the
doorsteps
with
his
small
right
hand
in
his
and
his
other
locked
in
that
of
florence
how
tight
the
tiny
pressure
of
that
one
and
how
loose
and
cold
the
other
the
doctor
was
sitting
in
his
portentous
study
with
a
globe
at
each
knee
books
all
round
him
homer
over
the
door
and
minerva
on
the
and
how
do
you
do
sir
he
said
to
dombey
when
they
had
been
ushered
in
and
how
is
my
little
friend
grave
as
an
organ
was
the
speech
and
when
he
ceased
the
great
clock
in
the
hall
seemed
to
paul
at
least
to
take
him
up
and
to
go
on
saying
over
and
over
and
over
again
the
little
friend
being
something
too
small
to
be
seen
at
all
from
where
the
doctor
sat
over
the
books
on
his
table
the
doctor
made
several
futile
attempts
to
get
a
view
of
him
round
the
legs
which
dombey
perceiving
relieved
the
doctor
from
his
embarrassment
by
taking
paul
up
in
his
arms
and
sitting
him
on
another
little
table
over
against
the
doctor
in
the
middle
of
the
room
ha
said
the
doctor
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hand
in
his
breast
now
i
see
my
little
friend
how
do
you
do
my
little
friend
the
clock
in
the
hall
subscribe
to
this
alteration
in
the
form
of
words
but
continued
to
repeat
very
well
i
thank
you
sir
returned
paul
answering
the
clock
quite
as
much
as
the
doctor
ha
said
doctor
blimber
shall
we
make
a
man
of
him
do
you
hear
paul
added
dombey
paul
being
silent
shall
we
make
a
man
of
him
repeated
the
doctor
i
had
rather
be
a
child
replied
paul
indeed
said
the
doctor
why
the
child
sat
on
the
table
looking
at
him
with
a
curious
expression
of
suppressed
emotion
in
his
face
and
beating
one
hand
proudly
on
his
knee
as
if
he
had
the
rising
tears
beneath
it
and
crushed
them
but
his
other
hand
strayed
a
little
way
the
while
a
little
from
him
it
lighted
on
the
neck
of
florence
this
is
why
it
seemed
to
say
and
then
the
steady
look
was
broken
up
and
gone
the
working
lip
was
loosened
and
the
tears
came
streaming
forth
never
mind
said
the
doctor
blandly
nodding
his
head
mind
we
shall
substitute
new
cares
and
new
impressions
dombey
very
shortly
you
would
wish
my
little
friend
to
everything
if
you
please
doctor
returned
dombey
firmly
yes
said
the
doctor
who
with
his
eyes
and
his
usual
smile
seemed
to
survey
paul
with
the
sort
of
interest
that
might
attach
to
some
choice
little
animal
he
was
going
to
stuff
yes
exactly
ha
we
shall
impart
a
great
variety
of
information
to
our
little
friend
and
bring
him
quickly
forward
i
dare
say
i
dare
say
as
soon
as
dombey
and
florence
were
gone
blimber
gave
into
the
charge
of
his
learned
daughter
cornelia
the
little
new
pupil
saying
bring
him
on
cornelia
bring
him
on
miss
blimber
received
her
young
ward
from
the
hands
and
paul
feeling
that
the
spectacles
were
surveying
him
cast
down
his
eyes
how
old
are
you
dombey
said
miss
blimber
six
answered
paul
wondering
as
he
stole
a
glance
at
the
young
lady
why
her
hair
grow
long
like
and
why
she
was
like
a
boy
how
much
do
you
know
of
your
latin
grammar
dombey
said
miss
blimber
none
of
it
answered
paul
feeling
that
the
answer
was
a
shock
to
miss
sensibility
he
looked
up
and
added
timidly
i
been
well
i
have
been
a
weak
child
i
learn
a
latin
grammar
when
i
was
out
every
day
with
old
glubb
i
wish
tell
old
glubb
to
come
and
see
me
if
you
please
what
a
dreadfully
low
name
said
miss
blimber
unclassical
to
a
degree
who
is
the
monster
child
what
monster
inquired
paul
glubb
no
more
a
monster
than
you
are
returned
paul
what
cried
the
doctor
in
a
terrible
voice
that
paul
was
dreadfully
frightened
but
still
he
made
a
stand
for
the
absent
glubb
though
he
did
it
trembling
a
very
nice
old
man
he
said
he
used
to
pull
my
carriage
for
me
down
along
the
beach
i
wish
let
him
come
to
see
me
he
knows
lots
of
things
ha
said
the
doctor
shaking
his
head
this
is
bad
but
study
will
do
much
blimber
opined
with
something
like
a
shiver
that
he
was
an
unaccountable
child
and
allowing
for
the
difference
of
visage
looked
at
him
pretty
much
as
pipchin
had
been
used
to
do
as
for
miss
blimber
she
told
him
to
come
down
to
her
room
that
evening
at
when
he
did
so
he
noticed
a
little
pile
of
new
books
which
she
was
glancing
over
these
are
yours
dombey
she
said
all
of
said
paul
yes
returned
miss
blimber
and
feeder
will
look
you
out
some
more
very
soon
if
you
are
as
studious
as
i
expect
you
will
be
dombey
thank
you
said
paul
i
am
going
out
for
a
constitutional
resumed
miss
blimber
and
while
i
am
gone
that
is
to
say
in
the
interval
between
this
and
breakfast
dombey
i
wish
you
to
read
over
what
i
have
marked
in
these
books
and
to
tell
me
if
you
quite
understand
what
you
have
got
to
learn
lose
time
dombey
for
you
have
none
to
spare
but
take
them
downstairs
and
begin
directly
yes
answered
paul
there
were
so
many
of
them
that
although
paul
put
one
hand
under
the
bottom
book
and
his
other
hand
and
his
chin
on
the
top
book
and
hugged
them
all
closely
the
middle
book
slipped
out
before
he
reached
the
door
and
then
they
all
tumbled
down
on
the
floor
miss
blimber
said
oh
dombey
dombey
this
is
really
very
careless
and
piled
them
up
afresh
for
him
and
this
time
by
dint
of
balancing
them
with
great
nicety
paul
got
out
of
the
room
but
if
the
poor
child
found
them
heavy
to
carry
downstairs
how
much
harder
was
it
to
cram
their
contents
into
his
head
oh
how
tired
he
grew
but
always
there
was
a
round
of
lessons
waiting
for
him
during
these
long
days
and
nights
that
blimber
and
cornelia
tried
to
make
a
man
of
him
and
all
week
long
his
aching
head
held
but
one
longing
saturday
to
come
oh
saturdays
oh
happy
saturdays
when
florence
always
came
at
noon
and
never
would
in
any
weather
stay
away
and
when
florence
found
how
hard
studies
were
for
him
she
quietly
bought
books
just
like
his
and
studied
them
during
the
week
so
that
she
might
keep
along
with
him
and
help
him
when
they
were
together
not
a
word
of
this
was
breathed
to
pipchin
but
many
a
night
when
she
was
in
bed
and
the
candles
were
spluttering
and
burning
low
florence
tried
so
hard
to
be
a
substitute
for
one
small
dombey
that
her
fortitude
and
perseverance
might
have
almost
won
her
a
free
right
to
bear
the
name
herself
and
high
was
her
reward
when
one
saturday
evening
as
little
paul
was
sitting
down
as
usual
to
resume
his
studies
she
sat
down
by
his
side
and
showed
him
all
that
was
so
rough
made
smooth
and
all
that
was
so
dark
made
clear
and
plain
before
him
it
was
nothing
but
a
startled
look
in
wan
then
a
close
god
knows
how
her
heart
leaped
up
at
this
rich
payment
for
her
trouble
oh
floy
cried
her
brother
how
i
love
you
how
i
love
you
floy
and
i
you
dear
oh
i
am
sure
of
that
floy
and
so
little
paul
struggled
on
bravely
under
his
heavy
load
never
complaining
but
growing
more
day
by
growing
frailer
too
illustration
pipchin
and
paul
dombey
then
came
the
holidays
and
a
grand
party
at
the
school
to
which
florence
came
looking
so
beautiful
in
her
simple
ball
dress
that
paul
could
hardly
make
up
his
mind
to
let
her
go
again
but
what
is
the
matter
floy
he
asked
almost
sure
he
saw
a
tear
on
her
face
nothing
dear
we
will
go
home
together
and
nurse
you
till
you
are
strong
again
nurse
me
echoed
paul
paul
understand
what
that
had
to
do
with
it
nor
why
the
other
guests
looked
on
so
seriously
nor
why
florence
turned
away
her
face
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
it
back
lighted
up
again
with
smiles
floy
said
paul
holding
a
ringlet
of
her
dark
hair
in
his
hand
tell
me
dear
do
think
i
have
grown
his
sister
laughed
and
fondled
him
and
told
him
no
because
i
know
they
say
so
returned
paul
and
i
want
to
know
what
they
mean
floy
florence
would
have
sat
by
him
all
night
and
would
not
have
danced
at
all
of
her
own
accord
but
paul
made
her
by
telling
her
how
much
it
pleased
him
and
he
told
her
the
truth
too
for
his
small
heart
swelled
and
his
face
glowed
when
he
saw
how
much
they
all
admired
her
and
how
she
was
the
beautiful
little
rosebud
of
the
room
then
after
the
party
came
the
for
paul
was
going
home
and
every
one
was
good
to
the
pompous
doctor
and
bade
him
with
many
regrets
for
they
were
afraid
as
they
looked
upon
his
pinched
wan
face
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
come
back
and
take
up
that
load
of
heavy
books
ever
again
there
was
a
great
deal
the
next
day
and
afterwards
which
paul
could
not
quite
get
clear
in
his
mind
as
why
they
stopped
at
for
a
while
instead
of
going
straight
home
why
he
lay
in
bed
with
florence
sitting
by
him
whether
that
had
been
his
father
in
the
room
or
only
a
tall
shadow
on
the
wall
he
could
not
even
remember
whether
he
had
often
said
to
florence
oh
floy
take
me
home
and
never
leave
me
but
he
thought
he
had
he
fancied
sometimes
he
had
heard
himself
repeating
take
me
home
floy
take
me
home
but
he
could
remember
when
he
got
home
and
was
carried
up
the
stairs
that
there
had
been
the
rumbling
of
a
coach
for
many
hours
together
while
he
lay
upon
the
seat
with
florence
still
beside
him
and
pipchin
sitting
opposite
he
remembered
his
old
bed
too
when
they
laid
him
down
in
it
but
there
was
something
else
and
recent
too
that
still
perplexed
him
i
want
to
speak
to
florence
if
you
please
he
said
to
florence
by
herself
for
a
moment
she
bent
down
over
him
and
the
others
stood
away
floy
my
pet
that
papa
in
the
hall
when
they
brought
me
from
the
coach
yes
dear
he
cry
and
go
into
his
room
floy
did
he
when
he
saw
me
coming
in
florence
shook
her
head
and
pressed
her
lips
against
his
cheek
very
glad
he
cry
said
little
paul
i
thought
he
did
tell
them
that
i
asked
paul
never
rose
from
his
little
bed
he
lay
there
listening
to
the
noises
in
the
street
quite
tranquilly
not
caring
much
how
time
went
but
watching
everything
about
him
with
observing
eyes
and
when
visitors
or
servants
came
softly
to
the
door
to
inquire
how
he
was
he
always
answered
for
himself
i
am
better
i
am
a
great
deal
better
thank
you
tell
papa
so
and
sometimes
when
he
awoke
out
of
a
feverish
dream
in
which
he
thought
a
river
was
bearing
him
away
he
would
see
a
figure
seated
motionless
with
bowed
head
at
the
foot
of
his
couch
then
he
would
stretch
out
his
hands
and
cry
be
so
sorry
for
me
dear
papa
indeed
i
am
quite
happy
his
father
coming
and
bending
down
to
he
did
quickly
and
without
first
pausing
by
the
held
him
round
the
neck
and
repeated
those
words
to
him
several
times
and
very
earnestly
and
paul
never
saw
him
in
his
room
at
any
time
whether
it
were
day
or
night
but
he
called
out
be
so
sorry
for
me
indeed
i
am
quite
happy
this
was
the
beginning
of
his
always
saying
in
the
morning
that
he
was
a
great
deal
better
and
that
they
were
to
tell
his
father
so
then
one
day
he
asked
to
see
all
his
friends
and
shook
hands
with
each
one
quietly
and
bade
them
his
father
he
clung
to
as
though
he
felt
more
deeply
for
that
proud
sorrow
and
disappointment
than
any
unhappiness
on
his
own
account
for
he
was
going
to
his
whom
he
had
often
talked
with
florence
in
these
closing
days
now
lay
me
down
he
said
and
floy
come
close
to
me
and
let
me
see
you
sister
and
brother
wound
their
arms
around
each
other
and
the
golden
light
came
streaming
in
and
fell
upon
them
locked
together
how
fast
the
river
runs
between
its
green
banks
and
the
rushes
floy
but
very
near
the
sea
i
hear
the
waves
they
always
said
so
presently
he
told
her
that
the
motion
of
the
boat
upon
the
stream
was
lulling
him
to
rest
how
green
the
banks
were
now
how
bright
the
flowers
growing
on
them
and
how
tall
the
rushes
now
the
boat
was
out
at
sea
but
gliding
smoothly
on
and
now
there
was
a
shore
before
him
who
stood
on
the
bank
he
put
his
hands
together
as
he
had
been
used
to
do
at
his
prayers
he
did
not
remove
his
arms
to
do
it
but
they
saw
him
fold
them
so
behind
her
neck
mamma
is
like
you
floy
i
know
her
by
the
face
but
tell
them
that
the
print
upon
the
stairs
at
school
is
not
divine
enough
the
light
about
the
head
is
shining
on
me
as
i
go
the
golden
ripple
on
the
wall
came
back
again
and
nothing
else
stirred
in
the
room
the
old
old
fashion
the
fashion
that
came
in
with
our
first
garments
and
will
last
unchanged
until
our
race
has
run
its
course
and
the
wide
firmament
is
rolled
up
like
a
scroll
the
old
old
oh
thank
god
all
who
see
it
for
that
older
fashion
yet
of
immortality
and
look
upon
us
angels
of
young
children
with
regards
not
quite
estranged
when
the
swift
river
bears
us
to
the
ocean
ii
florence
came
into
her
the
death
of
paul
far
from
softening
heart
toward
his
daughter
only
served
to
widen
the
gap
between
them
he
had
been
secretly
hurt
by
preference
for
florence
and
now
was
more
cold
and
distant
with
her
than
ever
she
poor
child
had
this
deep
sorrow
to
bear
in
addition
to
the
loss
of
paul
many
and
many
a
night
when
no
one
in
the
house
was
stirring
and
the
lights
were
all
extinguished
she
would
softly
leave
her
own
room
and
with
noiseless
feet
descend
the
staircase
and
approach
her
door
against
it
scarcely
breathing
she
would
rest
her
face
and
head
and
press
her
lips
in
the
yearning
of
her
love
she
crouched
upon
the
cold
stone
floor
outside
it
every
night
to
listen
even
for
his
breath
and
in
her
one
absorbing
wish
to
be
allowed
to
show
him
some
affection
to
be
a
consolation
to
him
to
win
him
over
to
some
tenderness
for
her
his
solitary
child
she
would
have
knelt
down
at
his
feet
if
she
had
dared
in
humble
supplication
no
one
knew
it
no
one
thought
of
it
the
door
was
ever
closed
and
he
shut
up
within
he
went
out
once
or
twice
and
it
was
said
in
the
house
that
he
was
very
soon
going
on
a
journey
but
he
lived
in
those
rooms
and
lived
alone
and
never
saw
her
or
inquired
for
her
perhaps
he
did
not
even
know
that
she
was
in
the
house
but
one
night
florence
found
the
door
slightly
ajar
she
paused
a
moment
tremblingly
and
then
pushed
it
open
and
entered
her
father
sat
at
his
old
table
in
the
middle
room
he
had
been
arranging
some
papers
and
destroying
others
and
the
latter
lay
in
fragile
ruins
before
him
the
rain
dripped
heavily
upon
the
glass
panes
in
the
outer
room
where
he
had
so
often
watched
poor
paul
a
baby
and
the
low
complainings
of
the
wind
were
heard
without
he
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
table
so
immersed
in
thought
that
a
far
heavier
tread
than
the
light
foot
of
his
child
could
make
might
have
failed
to
rouse
him
his
face
was
turned
towards
her
by
the
waning
lamp
and
at
that
haggard
hour
it
looked
worn
and
dejected
and
in
the
utter
loneliness
surrounding
him
there
was
an
appeal
to
florence
that
struck
home
papa
papa
speak
to
me
dear
papa
he
started
at
her
voice
what
is
the
matter
he
said
sternly
why
do
you
come
here
what
has
frightened
you
if
anything
had
frightened
her
it
was
the
face
he
turned
upon
her
the
glowing
love
within
the
breast
of
his
young
daughter
froze
before
it
and
she
stood
and
looked
at
him
as
if
stricken
into
stone
there
was
not
one
touch
of
tenderness
or
pity
in
it
did
he
see
before
him
the
successful
rival
of
his
son
in
health
and
life
did
he
look
upon
his
own
successful
rival
in
that
affection
did
a
mad
jealousy
and
withered
pride
poison
sweet
remembrances
that
should
have
endeared
and
made
her
precious
to
him
could
it
be
possible
that
it
was
gall
to
him
to
look
upon
her
in
her
beauty
and
her
promise
thinking
of
his
infant
boy
florence
had
no
such
thoughts
but
love
is
quick
to
know
when
it
is
spurned
and
hopeless
and
hope
died
out
of
hers
as
she
stood
looking
in
her
face
i
ask
you
florence
are
you
frightened
is
there
anything
the
matter
that
you
come
here
i
came
against
my
wishes
why
she
saw
he
knew
was
written
broadly
on
his
dropped
her
head
upon
her
hands
with
one
prolonged
low
cry
he
took
her
by
the
arm
his
hand
was
cold
and
loose
and
scarcely
closed
upon
her
you
are
tired
i
dare
say
he
said
taking
up
the
light
and
leading
her
towards
the
door
and
want
rest
we
all
want
rest
go
florence
you
have
been
dreaming
the
dream
she
had
had
was
over
then
god
help
her
and
she
felt
that
it
could
never
more
come
back
i
will
remain
here
to
light
you
up
the
stairs
the
whole
house
is
yours
above
there
said
her
father
slowly
you
are
its
mistress
now
still
covering
her
face
she
sobbed
and
answered
dear
papa
and
silently
ascended
once
she
looked
back
as
if
she
would
have
returned
to
him
but
for
fear
it
was
a
momentary
thought
too
hopeless
to
encourage
and
her
father
stood
therewith
the
unresponsive
her
fluttering
dress
was
lost
in
the
darkness
the
days
that
followed
were
lonely
and
sad
indeed
for
the
child
her
father
went
away
upon
a
journey
and
she
was
left
entirely
alone
in
the
great
house
but
for
the
companionship
of
a
faithful
maid
susan
nipper
and
of
her
dog
diogenes
then
some
kind
friends
in
the
country
took
pity
upon
her
loneliness
and
invited
her
to
visit
them
when
she
came
home
she
was
amazed
to
find
huge
scaffolds
built
all
around
the
house
it
was
being
remodelled
only
her
own
little
room
had
not
been
changed
the
explanation
for
all
this
work
came
a
few
days
later
when
her
father
came
home
accompanied
by
two
ladies
one
was
old
and
greatly
overdressed
the
very
beautiful
but
with
a
cold
hard
face
skewton
said
her
father
turning
to
the
first
and
holding
out
his
hand
this
is
my
daughter
florence
charming
i
am
sure
observed
the
lady
putting
up
her
glass
so
natural
my
darling
florence
you
must
kiss
me
if
you
please
florence
having
done
so
turned
towards
the
other
lady
by
whom
her
father
stood
waiting
edith
said
dombey
this
is
my
daughter
florence
florence
this
lady
will
soon
be
your
mamma
florence
started
and
looked
up
at
the
beautiful
face
in
a
conflict
of
emotions
among
which
the
tears
that
name
awakened
struggled
for
a
moment
with
surprise
interest
admiration
and
an
indefinable
sort
of
fear
then
she
cried
out
oh
papa
may
you
be
happy
may
you
be
very
very
happy
all
your
life
and
then
fell
weeping
on
the
bosom
there
was
a
short
silence
the
beautiful
lady
who
at
first
had
seemed
to
hesitate
whether
or
not
she
should
advance
to
florence
held
her
to
her
breast
and
pressed
the
hand
with
which
she
clasped
her
close
about
her
waist
as
if
to
reassure
and
comfort
her
not
one
word
passed
the
lips
she
bent
her
head
down
over
florence
and
she
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
but
said
no
word
shall
we
go
on
through
the
rooms
said
dombey
and
see
how
our
workmen
are
doing
pray
allow
me
my
dear
madam
he
said
this
in
offering
his
arm
to
skewton
and
they
turned
and
went
up
the
staircase
the
beautiful
lady
lingered
a
moment
to
whisper
to
the
little
girl
florence
said
the
lady
hurriedly
and
looking
into
her
face
with
great
earnestness
you
will
not
begin
by
hating
me
by
hating
you
mamma
cried
florence
winding
her
arm
round
her
neck
and
returning
the
look
hush
begin
by
thinking
well
of
me
said
the
beautiful
lady
begin
by
believing
that
i
will
try
to
make
you
happy
and
that
i
am
prepared
to
love
you
florence
again
she
pressed
her
to
her
had
spoken
in
a
rapid
manner
but
florence
saw
her
rejoin
them
in
the
other
room
and
now
florence
began
to
hope
that
she
would
learn
from
her
new
and
beautiful
mamma
how
to
gain
her
love
and
in
her
sleep
that
night
in
her
lost
old
home
her
own
mamma
smiled
radiantly
upon
the
hope
and
blessed
it
dreaming
florence
very
soon
after
this
her
new
mamma
came
to
live
with
them
and
the
gloomy
house
took
on
some
semblance
of
life
but
the
marriage
was
not
a
happy
one
even
florence
could
see
that
face
did
not
belie
her
character
she
was
haughty
and
fitting
match
for
dombey
he
had
married
her
out
of
a
desire
to
have
a
suitable
ornament
for
his
home
and
position
in
society
was
been
lured
into
a
fine
marriage
by
her
matchmaking
mother
it
was
no
wonder
then
that
the
marriage
should
be
unhappy
only
toward
florence
did
the
proud
lady
unbend
the
impulsive
greeting
had
stirred
her
heart
in
a
sudden
and
surprising
way
and
when
dombey
saw
how
lonely
she
was
and
how
her
life
had
been
starved
she
tried
to
make
good
her
promise
to
the
child
to
love
her
and
be
good
to
her
always
but
once
again
poor
florence
was
misunderstood
by
her
father
he
saw
that
his
cold
wife
cared
only
for
the
child
and
he
thought
that
just
as
florence
had
cheated
him
out
of
some
of
love
she
was
now
estranging
his
wife
from
him
it
was
cruelly
unjust
but
dombey
was
so
arrogant
that
he
could
see
things
only
in
his
own
narrow
way
thus
matters
went
along
in
this
unhappy
house
for
several
months
and
dombey
met
rarely
except
at
the
table
or
in
some
social
gathering
when
the
words
which
passed
between
them
were
of
the
coldest
then
dombey
hit
upon
the
meanest
trick
of
his
weak
nature
when
he
found
that
he
could
not
humble
his
wife
by
ordinary
means
he
called
in
his
business
manager
carker
a
smooth
deceitful
man
whose
hair
was
plastered
down
close
to
his
white
forehead
and
whose
teeth
shone
in
a
continual
sly
smile
to
carker
dombey
would
entrust
various
messages
for
dombey
as
to
the
running
of
the
house
the
hiring
of
servants
and
the
like
dombey
knew
that
she
would
resent
such
petty
interference
especially
through
an
outsider
but
he
did
not
know
that
she
submitted
quietly
to
these
indignities
simply
for
the
sake
of
florence
whom
she
wished
to
protect
and
even
her
love
for
the
girl
was
given
in
secret
for
the
same
reason
florence
long
since
awakened
from
her
dream
mournfully
observed
the
estrangement
between
her
father
and
new
mother
and
saw
it
widen
more
and
more
and
knew
that
there
was
greater
bitterness
between
them
every
day
it
had
been
very
hard
to
have
all
her
love
repulsed
but
it
now
seemed
harder
to
be
compelled
to
doubt
her
father
or
choose
between
him
and
this
mother
so
affectionate
and
dear
to
her
yet
whose
other
moods
she
could
only
witness
with
distrust
or
fear
one
great
sorrow
however
was
spared
her
she
never
had
the
least
suspicion
that
dombey
by
her
tenderness
for
her
widened
the
separation
from
her
father
or
gave
him
new
cause
of
dislike
if
she
had
thought
it
for
a
single
moment
what
grief
she
would
have
felt
what
sacrifice
she
would
have
tried
to
make
poor
loving
girl
no
word
was
ever
spoken
between
florence
and
her
mother
now
on
these
subjects
dombey
had
said
there
ought
to
be
between
them
in
that
wise
a
silence
like
the
grave
itself
and
florence
felt
that
she
was
right
in
this
state
of
affairs
her
father
was
brought
home
suffering
and
ill
and
gloomily
retired
to
his
own
rooms
where
he
was
tended
by
servants
not
approached
by
his
wife
and
had
no
friend
or
companion
but
carker
who
always
withdrew
near
midnight
every
night
florence
would
listen
out
in
the
hall
for
news
of
him
after
leaving
her
mother
but
late
one
evening
she
was
surprised
to
see
a
bright
light
burning
in
her
room
and
her
mother
sitting
before
the
dying
fire
looking
so
fiercely
at
it
that
it
terrified
her
mamma
she
cried
what
is
the
matter
dombey
started
looking
at
her
with
such
a
strange
dread
in
her
face
that
florence
was
more
frightened
than
before
mamma
said
florence
hurriedly
advancing
dear
mamma
what
is
the
matter
i
have
not
been
well
said
dombey
shaking
and
still
looking
at
her
in
the
same
strange
way
i
have
had
bad
dreams
my
love
and
have
not
yet
been
to
bed
mamma
no
she
returned
dreams
her
features
gradually
softened
and
suffering
florence
to
come
close
to
her
within
her
embrace
she
said
in
a
tender
manner
but
what
does
my
bird
do
here
what
does
my
bird
do
here
i
have
been
uneasy
mamma
in
not
seeing
you
and
in
not
knowing
how
papa
was
and
florence
stopped
there
and
said
no
more
is
it
late
her
mother
asked
fondly
putting
back
the
curls
that
mingled
with
her
own
dark
hair
and
strayed
upon
her
face
very
late
near
day
near
day
she
repeated
in
surprise
mamma
said
florence
oh
mamma
what
can
i
do
what
should
i
do
to
make
us
happier
is
there
anything
nothing
she
replied
are
you
sure
of
that
can
it
never
be
if
i
speak
now
of
what
is
in
my
thoughts
in
spite
of
what
we
have
agreed
said
florence
you
will
not
blame
me
will
you
it
is
useless
she
replied
useless
i
have
told
you
dear
that
i
have
had
bad
dreams
nothing
can
change
them
or
prevent
their
coming
back
i
do
not
understand
said
florence
gazing
on
her
agitated
face
which
seemed
to
darken
as
she
looked
her
clenched
hand
tightened
on
the
trembling
arm
she
had
in
hers
and
as
she
looked
down
on
the
alarmed
and
wondering
face
her
own
feelings
subsided
oh
florence
she
said
i
think
i
have
been
nearly
mad
and
humbled
her
proud
head
upon
the
neck
and
burst
into
tears
leave
me
be
near
me
i
have
no
hope
but
in
you
these
words
she
said
a
score
of
times
florence
was
greatly
puzzled
and
distressed
and
could
only
repeat
her
promise
of
love
and
trust
through
six
months
that
followed
upon
illness
and
recovery
no
outward
change
was
shown
between
him
and
his
wife
both
were
cold
and
proud
and
still
man
whom
she
his
petty
commands
to
her
as
for
florence
the
little
hope
she
had
ever
held
for
happiness
in
their
new
home
was
quite
gone
now
that
home
was
nearly
two
years
old
and
even
the
patient
trust
that
was
in
her
could
not
survive
the
daily
blight
of
such
an
experience
florence
loved
her
father
still
but
by
degrees
had
come
to
love
him
rather
as
some
dear
one
who
had
been
or
who
might
have
been
than
as
the
hard
reality
before
her
eyes
something
of
the
softened
sadness
with
which
she
loved
the
memory
of
little
paul
or
her
mother
seemed
to
enter
now
into
her
thoughts
of
him
and
to
make
them
as
it
were
a
dear
remembrance
whether
it
was
that
he
was
dead
to
her
and
that
partly
for
this
reason
partly
for
his
share
in
those
old
objects
of
her
affection
and
partly
for
the
long
association
of
him
with
hopes
that
were
withered
and
tendernesses
he
had
frozen
she
could
not
have
told
but
the
father
whom
she
loved
began
to
be
a
vague
and
dreamy
idea
to
her
hardly
more
substantially
connected
with
her
real
life
than
the
image
she
would
sometimes
conjure
up
of
her
dear
brother
yet
alive
and
growing
to
be
a
man
who
would
protect
and
cherish
her
the
change
if
it
may
be
called
one
had
stolen
on
her
like
the
change
from
childhood
to
womanhood
and
had
come
with
it
florence
was
almost
seventeen
when
in
her
lonely
musings
she
was
conscious
of
these
thoughts
she
was
often
alone
now
for
the
old
association
between
her
and
her
mamma
was
greatly
changed
at
the
time
of
her
illness
and
when
he
was
lying
in
his
room
downstairs
florence
had
first
observed
that
edith
avoided
her
wounded
and
shocked
and
yet
unable
to
reconcile
this
with
her
affection
when
they
did
meet
she
sought
her
in
her
own
room
at
night
once
more
mamma
said
florence
stealing
softly
to
her
side
have
i
offended
you
she
answered
no
i
must
have
done
something
said
florence
tell
me
what
it
is
you
have
changed
your
manner
to
me
dear
mamma
i
can
not
say
how
instantly
i
feel
the
least
change
for
i
love
you
with
my
whole
heart
as
i
do
you
said
dombey
ah
florence
believe
me
never
more
than
now
why
do
you
go
away
from
me
so
often
and
keep
away
asked
florence
and
why
do
you
sometimes
look
so
strangely
on
me
dear
mamma
you
do
so
do
you
not
dear
florence
it
is
for
your
good
why
i
can
not
tell
you
now
but
you
will
believe
i
have
always
tried
to
make
you
happy
dear
will
you
not
mamma
said
florence
anxiously
there
is
a
change
in
you
in
more
than
what
you
say
to
me
which
alarms
me
let
me
stay
with
you
a
little
no
dearest
i
am
best
left
alone
now
and
i
do
best
to
keep
apart
from
you
of
all
else
ask
me
no
questions
but
believe
that
what
i
am
i
am
not
of
my
own
will
or
for
myself
forgive
me
for
having
ever
darkened
your
dark
am
a
shadow
on
it
i
know
let
us
never
speak
of
this
again
mamma
sobbed
florence
we
are
not
to
part
we
do
this
that
we
may
not
part
said
her
mother
ask
no
more
go
florence
my
love
and
my
remorse
go
with
you
thus
did
dombey
hide
from
florence
one
dark
her
husband
was
displeased
with
their
love
for
each
other
it
was
for
welfare
that
she
felt
compelled
to
hide
her
affections
from
that
hour
florence
and
she
were
as
they
had
been
no
more
for
days
together
they
would
seldom
meet
except
at
table
and
when
dombey
was
present
then
dombey
imperious
inflexible
and
silent
never
looked
at
her
whenever
carker
was
of
the
party
as
he
often
was
during
the
progress
of
recovery
she
was
more
distant
towards
her
than
at
other
times
yet
she
and
florence
never
encountered
when
there
was
no
one
by
but
she
would
embrace
her
as
affectionately
as
of
old
though
not
with
the
same
relenting
of
her
proud
aspect
and
often
when
she
had
been
out
late
she
would
steal
up
to
room
as
she
had
been
used
to
do
in
the
dark
and
whisper
then
came
a
dreadful
day
not
long
afterwards
when
it
was
found
that
dombey
had
fled
from
her
home
the
day
was
the
second
anniversary
of
this
marriage
and
the
poor
misguided
woman
left
a
note
for
her
husband
telling
him
that
she
had
gone
away
with
the
man
whom
he
had
trusted
most
and
whom
she
hated
most
carker
it
was
a
foolish
way
to
be
revenged
for
the
harsh
treatment
she
had
received
but
it
served
her
purpose
dombey
was
wounded
in
his
most
vulnerable
pride
as
for
florence
she
was
overcome
with
grief
yet
in
the
midst
of
her
own
emotion
she
could
realize
her
bitterness
yielding
at
once
to
the
impulse
of
her
affection
and
forgetful
of
his
past
coldness
florence
hurried
to
him
with
her
arms
stretched
out
and
crying
oh
dear
dear
papa
tried
to
clasp
him
round
the
neck
but
in
his
wild
despair
he
shook
her
off
so
roughly
that
she
almost
fell
to
the
floor
telling
her
she
could
join
her
mother
for
all
he
cared
as
they
had
always
been
in
league
against
him
she
did
not
sink
down
at
his
feet
she
did
not
shut
out
the
sight
of
him
with
her
trembling
hands
she
did
not
weep
nor
speak
one
word
of
reproach
she
only
uttered
a
single
low
cry
of
pain
and
then
fled
from
the
house
like
a
hunted
animal
without
a
roof
over
her
father
or
mother
she
was
indeed
an
orphan
while
the
days
went
by
after
flight
what
was
the
proud
man
doing
did
he
ever
think
of
his
daughter
or
wonder
where
she
had
gone
did
he
suppose
she
had
come
home
again
and
was
leading
her
old
life
in
the
weary
house
he
did
not
utter
her
name
or
make
any
search
for
her
he
might
have
thought
of
her
constantly
or
not
at
all
it
was
all
one
for
any
sign
he
made
but
this
was
sure
he
did
not
think
that
he
had
lost
her
he
had
no
suspicion
of
the
truth
that
she
had
fled
away
from
him
he
had
lived
too
long
shut
up
in
his
pride
seeing
her
a
patient
gentle
creature
in
his
path
to
have
any
fear
of
that
and
so
he
waited
day
by
day
until
she
should
make
her
appearance
on
the
stairs
or
at
the
table
as
before
but
the
days
dragged
slowly
by
and
she
did
not
come
the
sea
had
ebbed
and
flowed
through
a
whole
year
through
a
whole
year
the
winds
and
clouds
had
come
and
gone
the
ceaseless
work
of
time
had
been
performed
in
storm
and
sunshine
through
a
whole
year
the
famous
house
of
dombey
and
son
had
fought
a
fight
for
life
against
doubtful
rumors
unsuccessful
ventures
and
most
of
all
against
the
bad
judgment
of
its
head
who
would
not
contract
its
enterprises
by
a
breadth
and
would
not
listen
to
a
word
of
warning
that
the
ship
he
strained
so
hard
against
the
storm
was
weak
and
could
not
bear
it
for
dombey
had
grown
strangely
indifferent
and
reckless
and
plunged
blindly
into
speculation
the
year
was
out
and
the
great
house
was
down
one
summer
afternoon
there
was
a
buzz
and
whisper
about
the
streets
of
london
of
a
great
failure
a
certain
cold
proud
man
well
known
there
was
not
there
nor
was
he
represented
there
next
day
it
was
noised
abroad
that
dombey
and
son
had
stopped
and
next
night
there
was
a
list
of
bankrupts
published
headed
by
that
name
opinion
stayed
the
misfortune
lightened
it
or
made
it
heavier
it
was
understood
that
the
affairs
of
the
house
were
to
be
wound
up
as
they
best
could
be
that
dombey
freely
resigned
everything
he
had
and
asked
for
no
favor
from
any
one
that
any
resumption
of
the
business
was
out
of
the
question
as
he
would
listen
to
no
friendly
negotiation
having
that
compromise
in
view
that
he
had
relinquished
every
post
of
trust
or
distinction
he
had
held
as
a
man
respected
among
merchants
and
that
he
was
a
broken
man
the
old
home
where
paul
had
died
and
whence
florence
had
fled
away
was
now
empty
and
wreck
of
what
it
had
been
all
the
furniture
and
hangings
had
been
sold
to
satisfy
creditors
and
he
now
lived
there
alone
in
one
cheerless
man
without
friends
without
hope
but
at
last
he
began
to
come
to
his
senses
to
see
what
a
treasure
he
had
cast
away
in
florence
to
recall
his
own
injustice
and
cruelty
toward
her
in
the
miserable
night
he
thought
of
it
in
the
dreary
day
the
wretched
dawn
the
ghostly
twilight
he
remembered
in
agony
in
sorrow
in
remorse
in
despair
papa
papa
he
heard
the
words
again
and
saw
the
face
he
saw
it
fall
upon
the
trembling
hands
and
heard
the
one
prolonged
low
cry
go
upward
oh
he
did
remember
it
the
rain
that
fell
upon
the
roof
the
wind
that
mourned
outside
the
door
had
foreknowledge
in
their
melancholy
sound
he
knew
now
what
he
had
done
he
knew
now
that
he
had
called
down
that
upon
his
head
which
bowed
it
lower
than
the
heaviest
stroke
of
fortune
he
knew
now
what
it
was
to
be
rejected
and
deserted
now
when
every
loving
blossom
he
had
withered
in
his
innocent
heart
was
snowing
down
in
ashes
on
him
he
thought
of
her
as
she
had
been
that
night
when
he
and
his
bride
came
home
he
thought
of
her
as
she
had
been
in
all
the
home
events
of
the
abandoned
house
he
thought
now
that
of
all
around
him
she
alone
had
never
changed
his
boy
had
faded
into
dust
his
proud
wife
had
deserted
him
his
flatterer
and
friend
had
been
transformed
into
the
worst
of
villains
his
riches
had
melted
away
the
very
walls
that
sheltered
him
looked
on
him
as
a
stranger
she
alone
had
turned
the
same
mild
gentle
look
upon
him
always
yes
to
the
latest
and
the
last
she
had
never
changed
to
had
he
ever
changed
to
she
was
lost
as
one
by
one
they
fell
away
before
his
baby
hope
his
wife
his
friend
his
how
the
mist
through
which
he
had
seen
her
cleared
and
showed
him
her
true
self
how
much
better
than
this
that
he
had
loved
her
as
he
had
his
boy
and
lost
her
as
he
had
his
boy
and
laid
them
in
their
early
grave
together
as
the
days
dragged
by
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
should
go
mad
with
remorse
and
longing
he
haunted
room
and
empty
though
they
were
his
only
he
had
meant
to
go
away
but
clung
to
this
tie
in
the
house
as
the
last
and
only
thing
left
to
him
he
would
go
came
he
would
go
every
night
within
the
knowledge
of
no
human
creature
he
came
forth
and
wandered
through
the
despoiled
house
like
a
ghost
many
a
morning
when
the
day
broke
with
altered
face
drooping
behind
the
closed
blind
in
his
window
he
pondered
on
the
loss
of
his
two
children
it
was
one
child
no
more
he
reunited
them
in
his
thoughts
and
they
were
never
asunder
then
one
day
when
strange
fancies
oppressed
him
more
than
usual
he
paused
at
door
and
gazed
wildly
down
as
though
suddenly
awakened
from
a
dream
he
heard
a
loving
pleading
there
at
his
knees
knelt
florence
herself
papa
dearest
papa
i
have
come
back
to
ask
forgiveness
i
never
can
be
happy
more
without
it
unchanged
still
of
all
the
world
unchanged
raising
the
same
face
to
his
as
on
that
miserable
night
asking
forgiveness
dear
papa
oh
look
strangely
on
me
i
never
meant
to
leave
you
i
never
thought
of
it
before
or
afterwards
i
was
frightened
when
i
went
away
and
could
not
think
papa
dear
i
am
changed
i
am
penitent
i
know
my
fault
i
know
my
duty
better
now
papa
cast
me
off
or
i
shall
die
he
tottered
to
his
chair
he
felt
her
draw
his
arms
about
her
neck
he
felt
her
put
her
own
round
his
he
felt
her
kisses
on
his
face
he
felt
her
wet
cheek
laid
against
his
own
he
how
deeply
that
he
had
done
upon
the
breast
that
he
had
bruised
against
the
heart
that
he
had
almost
broken
she
laid
his
face
now
covered
with
his
hands
and
said
sobbing
i
have
been
far
away
dear
papa
and
could
not
come
back
before
this
i
have
been
across
the
seas
and
i
have
a
home
of
my
own
over
there
now
oh
i
want
you
to
see
it
i
want
to
take
you
there
for
my
home
is
always
say
you
will
pardon
me
will
come
to
me
he
would
have
said
it
if
he
could
he
would
have
raised
his
hands
and
besought
for
pardon
but
she
caught
them
in
her
own
and
put
them
down
hurriedly
you
will
come
i
know
dear
papa
and
i
will
know
by
that
that
you
forgive
me
and
we
will
never
talk
about
what
is
past
and
forgotten
never
again
as
she
clung
closer
to
him
in
another
burst
of
tears
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
and
lifting
up
his
eyes
said
oh
my
god
forgive
me
for
i
need
it
very
much
with
that
he
dropped
his
head
again
lamenting
over
and
caressing
her
and
there
was
not
a
sound
in
all
the
house
for
a
long
long
time
they
remaining
clasped
in
one
arms
in
the
glorious
sunshine
that
had
crept
in
with
florence
story
of
pip
as
told
by
how
pip
helped
the
my
family
name
being
pirrip
and
my
christian
name
philip
my
infant
tongue
could
make
of
both
names
nothing
longer
than
pip
so
i
called
myself
pip
and
came
to
be
called
pip
i
give
pirrip
as
my
family
name
on
the
authority
of
his
tombstone
and
my
joe
gargery
who
married
the
blacksmith
as
i
never
saw
my
father
or
my
mother
my
first
fancies
regarding
what
they
were
like
were
unreasonably
derived
from
their
tombstones
ours
was
the
marsh
country
down
by
the
river
within
twenty
miles
of
the
sea
my
most
vivid
memory
of
these
early
days
was
of
a
raw
evening
about
dusk
at
such
a
time
i
found
out
for
certain
that
this
bleak
spot
where
i
chanced
to
be
wandering
all
alone
was
the
churchyard
that
the
low
leaden
line
beyond
was
the
river
and
that
the
small
bundle
of
shivers
growing
afraid
of
it
all
and
beginning
to
cry
was
hold
your
noise
cried
a
terrible
voice
as
a
man
started
up
from
among
the
graves
at
the
side
of
the
church
porch
he
was
a
fearful
looking
man
clad
in
coarse
gray
covered
with
mud
and
brambles
and
with
a
great
clanking
chain
upon
his
leg
tell
us
your
name
said
the
man
quick
pip
sir
show
us
where
you
live
said
the
man
out
the
place
i
pointed
to
where
our
village
lay
on
the
flat
among
the
trees
a
mile
or
more
from
the
church
the
man
after
looking
at
me
for
a
moment
turned
me
and
emptied
my
pockets
there
was
nothing
in
them
but
a
piece
of
bread
when
the
church
came
to
he
was
so
sudden
and
strong
that
he
made
it
go
before
me
and
i
saw
the
steeple
under
my
the
church
came
to
itself
i
say
i
was
seated
on
a
high
tombstone
trembling
while
he
ate
the
bread
ravenously
you
young
dog
said
the
man
licking
his
lips
what
fat
cheeks
you
got
i
believe
they
were
fat
though
i
was
at
that
time
undersized
for
my
years
and
not
strong
darn
if
i
eat
said
the
man
with
a
threatening
shake
of
his
head
and
if
i
half
a
mind
i
earnestly
expressed
my
hope
that
he
and
held
tighter
to
the
tombstone
on
which
he
had
put
me
partly
to
keep
myself
upon
it
partly
to
keep
myself
from
crying
now
lookee
here
said
the
man
your
mother
there
sir
said
i
he
started
made
a
short
run
and
stopped
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
there
sir
i
timidly
explained
pointing
to
an
inscription
on
a
stone
my
mother
oh
said
he
coming
back
and
is
that
your
father
alonger
your
mother
yes
sir
said
i
him
too
of
this
ha
he
muttered
then
considering
who
ye
live
kindly
let
to
live
which
i
made
up
my
mind
about
my
sister
joe
of
joe
gargery
the
blacksmith
sir
blacksmith
eh
said
he
and
looked
down
at
his
leg
after
darkly
looking
at
his
leg
and
at
me
several
times
he
came
closer
to
my
tombstone
took
me
by
both
arms
and
tilted
me
back
as
far
as
he
could
hold
me
so
that
his
eyes
looked
most
powerfully
down
into
mine
and
mine
looked
most
helplessly
up
into
his
now
lookee
here
he
said
the
question
being
whether
to
be
let
to
live
you
know
what
a
file
is
yes
sir
and
you
know
what
wittles
is
yes
sir
after
each
question
he
tilted
me
over
a
little
more
so
as
to
give
me
a
greater
sense
of
helplessness
and
danger
you
get
me
a
file
he
tilted
me
again
and
you
get
me
some
wittles
if
you
he
tilted
me
again
and
shook
me
till
my
teeth
chattered
will
sir
said
i
if
you
will
only
let
me
go
run
all
the
way
home
well
see
that
you
come
back
but
morning
will
day
wait
for
you
here
as
he
released
me
i
needed
no
second
bidding
but
scurried
away
as
fast
as
i
could
and
soon
reached
the
blacksmith
shop
my
sister
joe
gargery
was
more
than
twenty
years
older
than
i
and
had
established
a
great
reputation
with
herself
and
the
neighbors
because
she
had
brought
me
up
by
hand
having
at
that
time
to
find
out
for
myself
what
the
expression
meant
and
knowing
her
to
have
a
hard
and
heavy
hand
and
to
be
much
in
the
habit
of
laying
it
upon
her
husband
as
well
as
upon
me
i
supposed
that
joe
gargery
and
i
were
both
brought
up
by
hand
she
was
not
a
woman
my
sister
and
i
had
a
general
impression
that
she
must
have
made
joe
gargery
marry
her
by
hand
joe
was
a
fair
man
with
curls
of
flaxen
hair
on
each
side
of
his
smooth
face
and
with
eyes
of
such
a
very
undecided
blue
that
they
seemed
to
have
somehow
got
mixed
with
their
own
whites
he
was
a
mild
foolish
dear
sort
of
hercules
in
strength
and
also
in
weakness
my
sister
joe
with
black
hair
and
eyes
had
such
a
prevailing
redness
of
skin
that
i
sometimes
used
to
wonder
whether
it
was
possible
she
washed
herself
with
a
instead
of
soap
she
was
tall
and
bony
and
almost
always
wore
a
coarse
apron
fastened
behind
with
two
loops
and
having
a
bib
in
front
that
was
stuck
full
of
pins
and
needles
forge
adjoined
our
house
which
was
a
wooden
house
as
many
of
the
dwellings
in
our
country
of
them
at
that
time
when
i
ran
home
from
the
churchyard
the
forge
was
shut
up
and
joe
was
sitting
alone
in
the
kitchen
joe
and
i
being
and
having
confidences
as
such
joe
imparted
a
confidence
to
me
the
moment
i
raised
the
latch
of
the
door
and
peeped
in
at
him
opposite
to
it
sitting
in
the
chimney
corner
joe
has
been
out
a
dozen
times
looking
for
you
pip
and
out
now
making
it
a
dozen
is
she
yes
pip
said
joe
and
worse
got
tickler
with
her
at
this
dismal
intelligence
i
twisted
the
only
button
on
my
waistcoat
round
and
round
and
looked
in
great
depression
at
the
fire
tickler
was
a
piece
of
cane
worn
smooth
by
collision
with
my
tickled
frame
she
sot
down
said
joe
and
she
got
up
and
she
made
a
grab
at
tickler
and
she
rampaged
out
what
she
did
said
joe
slowly
clearing
the
fire
between
the
lower
bars
with
the
poker
and
looking
at
it
she
rampaged
out
pip
has
she
been
gone
long
joe
i
always
treated
him
as
no
more
than
my
equal
well
said
joe
glancing
up
at
the
dutch
clock
been
on
the
rampage
this
last
spell
about
five
minutes
pip
a
coming
get
behind
the
door
old
chap
and
have
the
betwixt
you
i
took
the
advice
my
sister
joe
throwing
the
door
wide
open
and
finding
an
obstruction
behind
it
immediately
divined
the
cause
and
applied
tickler
to
its
farther
investigation
where
have
you
been
she
demanded
between
tickles
i
have
only
been
to
the
churchyard
said
i
crying
and
rubbing
myself
churchyard
repeated
my
sister
if
it
for
me
been
to
the
churchyard
long
ago
and
stayed
there
who
brought
you
up
by
hand
my
thoughts
strayed
from
that
question
as
i
looked
disconsolately
at
the
fire
for
the
fugitive
out
on
the
marshes
with
the
ironed
leg
the
file
the
food
and
the
dreadful
pledge
i
was
under
to
steal
from
under
my
very
roof
rose
before
me
in
the
avenging
coals
ha
said
joe
restoring
tickler
to
his
station
churchyard
indeed
you
may
well
say
churchyard
you
two
one
of
us
by
the
by
had
not
said
it
at
all
drive
to
the
churchyard
betwixt
you
one
of
these
days
and
oh
a
pair
be
without
me
as
she
applied
herself
to
set
the
joe
peeped
down
at
me
over
his
leg
as
if
he
were
mentally
calculating
what
kind
of
pair
we
should
make
under
such
circumstances
after
that
he
sat
feeling
his
flaxen
curls
and
whisker
and
following
joe
about
with
his
blue
eyes
as
his
manner
always
was
at
squally
times
my
sister
had
a
sudden
severe
way
of
cutting
and
buttering
bread
which
never
varied
now
she
ripped
me
off
a
section
of
loaf
bidding
me
eat
and
be
thankful
though
i
was
hungry
i
dared
not
eat
for
she
was
a
strict
housekeeper
who
would
miss
any
further
slices
and
i
must
not
let
that
dreadful
man
out
in
the
churchyard
go
hungry
so
i
resolved
to
put
my
hunk
of
bread
and
butter
down
the
leg
of
my
plan
which
i
presently
found
the
chance
to
carry
out
it
was
christmas
eve
and
i
had
to
stir
the
pudding
for
next
day
with
a
i
tried
it
with
the
load
upon
my
leg
and
that
made
me
think
afresh
of
the
man
with
the
load
on
leg
and
found
the
tendency
of
exercise
to
bring
the
out
at
my
ankle
quite
unmanageable
happily
i
slipped
away
and
deposited
that
part
of
my
conscience
in
my
garret
bedroom
hark
said
i
when
i
had
done
my
stirring
and
was
taking
a
final
warm
in
the
chimney
corner
before
being
sent
up
to
bed
was
that
great
guns
joe
ah
said
joe
another
conwict
off
what
does
that
mean
joe
said
joe
who
always
took
explanations
upon
herself
said
snappishly
escaped
escaped
there
was
a
conwict
off
last
night
added
joe
after
and
they
fired
warning
of
him
and
now
it
appears
firing
warning
of
another
firing
said
i
drat
that
boy
interposed
my
sister
frowning
at
me
over
her
work
what
a
questioner
he
is
ask
no
questions
and
be
told
no
lies
it
was
not
very
polite
to
herself
i
thought
as
she
always
answered
but
she
never
was
polite
unless
there
was
company
presently
joe
said
to
me
in
a
quiet
kind
of
whisper
hulks
pip
prison
ships
firing
because
one
of
the
thieves
on
the
hulks
is
got
away
thieves
prison
ships
and
here
i
was
planning
to
rob
my
sister
of
the
bread
and
butter
and
honest
joe
of
a
file
truly
conscience
is
a
fearful
thing
yet
there
was
no
turning
back
for
me
that
night
the
rest
of
the
dreadful
deed
was
done
just
before
daybreak
i
crept
out
carrying
the
file
which
i
had
found
among
tools
the
slice
of
bread
and
a
pie
which
was
too
convenient
in
the
pantry
and
which
i
took
in
the
hope
it
was
not
intended
for
early
use
and
would
not
be
missed
for
some
time
i
found
the
man
with
the
iron
waiting
for
me
crouched
behind
a
tombstone
are
you
alone
he
asked
hoarsely
yes
sir
no
one
following
you
no
sir
well
said
he
i
believe
you
give
me
them
wittles
quick
i
had
often
watched
a
large
dog
of
ours
eating
his
food
and
i
now
noticed
a
decided
similarity
between
the
way
of
eating
and
the
the
man
took
strong
sharp
sudden
bites
just
like
the
dog
he
swallowed
or
rather
snapped
up
every
mouthful
too
soon
and
too
fast
and
he
looked
sideways
here
and
there
while
he
ate
as
if
he
thought
there
was
danger
in
every
direction
of
coming
to
take
the
pie
away
now
give
us
hold
of
the
file
boy
he
said
when
he
had
finished
swallowing
i
did
so
and
he
bent
to
the
iron
like
a
madman
and
began
filing
it
away
in
quick
fierce
rasps
i
judged
this
a
good
time
to
slip
away
and
he
paid
no
further
attention
to
me
the
last
i
heard
of
him
the
file
was
still
going
and
where
the
mischief
you
been
was
christmas
salutation
when
i
and
my
conscience
showed
ourselves
i
said
i
had
been
down
to
hear
the
chimes
ah
well
observed
joe
you
might
done
worse
not
a
doubt
of
that
i
thought
we
were
to
have
a
superb
joe
slyly
told
of
a
leg
of
pork
and
greens
a
pair
of
roast
stuffed
fowls
and
a
handsome
pie
which
had
been
baked
the
day
before
i
started
when
he
spoke
about
the
pie
but
his
blue
eyes
beamed
upon
me
kindly
my
sister
having
so
much
to
do
was
going
to
church
vicariously
that
is
to
say
joe
and
i
were
going
in
his
working
clothes
joe
was
a
blacksmith
in
his
holiday
clothes
he
was
more
like
a
scarecrow
in
good
circumstances
than
anything
else
nothing
that
he
wore
then
fitted
him
or
seemed
to
belong
to
him
on
the
present
festive
occasion
he
emerged
from
his
room
when
the
blithe
bells
were
ringing
the
picture
of
misery
in
a
full
suit
of
sunday
penitentials
as
to
me
i
think
my
sister
must
have
had
some
general
idea
that
i
was
a
young
offender
who
must
be
punished
each
by
being
put
into
clothes
so
tight
that
i
could
on
no
account
move
my
arms
and
legs
without
danger
of
something
bursting
joe
and
i
going
to
church
therefore
must
have
been
a
moving
spectacle
for
compassionate
minds
yet
what
i
suffered
outside
was
nothing
to
what
i
underwent
within
the
terrors
that
had
assailed
me
whenever
joe
had
gone
near
the
pantry
or
out
of
the
room
were
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
remorse
with
which
my
mind
dwelt
on
what
my
hands
had
done
under
the
weight
of
my
wicked
secret
i
pondered
whether
even
the
church
would
be
powerful
enough
to
shield
me
from
the
wrath
to
come
wopsle
the
clerk
at
church
was
to
dine
with
us
and
hubble
the
wheelwright
and
hubble
and
uncle
pumblechook
uncle
but
joe
appropriated
him
who
was
a
cornchandler
in
the
nearest
town
and
drove
his
own
the
dinner
hour
was
one
when
joe
and
i
got
home
we
found
the
table
laid
and
joe
dressed
and
the
dinner
dressing
and
the
front
door
unlocked
it
never
was
at
any
other
time
for
the
company
to
enter
by
and
everything
most
splendid
and
still
not
a
word
of
the
robbery
oh
the
agony
of
that
festive
dinner
during
each
helping
of
my
plate
i
ate
mechanically
hardly
daring
to
lift
my
eyes
and
clutching
frantically
at
the
leg
of
the
table
for
support
with
each
mouthful
we
drew
nearer
to
that
discovery
but
as
they
chattered
away
i
felt
a
faint
hope
that
they
might
perhaps
forget
the
pie
they
did
not
for
presently
my
sister
said
to
joe
clean
i
got
a
fresh
hold
on
the
table
leg
i
foresaw
i
was
doomed
you
must
taste
said
my
sister
addressing
the
guests
with
her
best
grace
you
must
finish
with
a
pie
in
honor
of
uncle
pumblechook
the
company
murmured
their
compliments
uncle
pumblechook
sensible
of
having
deserved
well
of
his
said
vivaciously
all
things
considered
well
joe
do
our
best
endeavors
let
us
have
a
cut
at
this
same
pie
my
sister
went
out
to
get
it
i
heard
her
steps
proceed
to
the
pantry
i
saw
pumblechook
balance
his
knife
i
saw
reawakening
appetite
in
the
roman
nostrils
of
wopsle
i
heard
hubble
remark
that
a
bit
of
savory
pie
would
lay
atop
of
anything
you
could
mention
and
do
no
harm
and
i
heard
joe
say
you
shall
have
some
pip
i
have
never
been
absolutely
certain
whether
i
uttered
a
shrill
yell
of
terror
merely
in
spirit
or
in
the
bodily
hearing
of
the
company
i
felt
that
i
could
bear
no
more
and
that
i
must
run
away
i
released
the
leg
of
the
table
and
ran
for
my
life
but
i
ran
no
farther
than
the
house
door
for
there
i
ran
headforemost
into
a
party
of
soldiers
with
their
muskets
one
of
whom
held
out
a
pair
of
handcuffs
to
me
saying
here
you
are
look
sharp
come
on
the
vision
of
a
file
of
soldiers
caused
the
dinner
party
to
rise
from
the
table
in
confusion
and
caused
joe
the
kitchen
to
stop
short
and
stare
in
her
wondering
lament
of
gracious
goodness
gracious
me
excuse
me
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
the
sergeant
but
as
i
have
mentioned
at
the
door
to
this
smart
young
shaver
which
he
i
am
on
a
chase
in
the
name
of
the
king
and
i
want
the
blacksmith
and
pray
what
might
you
want
with
him
retorted
my
sister
quick
to
resent
his
being
wanted
at
all
missis
returned
the
gallant
sergeant
speaking
for
myself
i
should
reply
the
honor
and
pleasure
of
his
fine
acquaintance
speaking
for
the
king
i
answer
a
little
job
done
this
was
received
as
rather
neat
in
the
sergeant
insomuch
that
pumblechook
cried
audibly
good
again
you
see
blacksmith
said
the
sergeant
who
had
by
this
time
picked
out
joe
with
his
eye
we
have
had
an
accident
with
these
and
i
find
the
lock
of
one
of
goes
wrong
and
the
coupling
act
pretty
as
they
are
wanted
for
immediate
service
will
you
throw
your
eye
over
them
joe
threw
his
eye
over
them
and
pronounced
that
the
job
would
necessitate
the
lighting
of
his
forge
fire
and
would
take
nearer
two
hours
than
one
will
it
then
will
you
set
about
it
at
once
blacksmith
said
the
sergeant
as
on
his
service
and
if
my
men
can
bear
a
hand
anywhere
make
themselves
useful
with
that
he
called
to
his
men
who
came
trooping
into
the
kitchen
one
after
another
and
piled
their
arms
in
a
corner
all
these
things
i
saw
without
then
knowing
that
i
saw
them
for
i
was
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
but
beginning
to
perceive
that
the
handcuffs
were
not
for
me
and
that
the
military
had
so
far
got
the
better
of
the
pie
as
to
put
it
in
the
background
i
collected
a
little
more
of
my
scattered
wits
illustration
pip
brings
the
convict
some
food
the
soldiers
were
out
hunting
for
the
convicts
that
had
escaped
and
as
soon
as
joe
had
mended
the
handcuffs
they
fell
in
line
and
started
again
for
the
marshes
joe
caught
an
appealing
look
from
me
and
timidly
asked
if
he
and
i
might
go
along
with
them
the
consent
was
given
and
away
we
went
after
a
rough
journey
over
bogs
and
through
briars
a
loud
shout
from
the
soldiers
in
front
announced
that
one
of
the
fugitives
had
been
caught
we
ran
hastily
up
and
peered
into
a
ditch
it
was
my
convict
he
was
hustled
into
the
handcuffs
and
hustled
up
a
hill
where
stood
a
rough
hut
or
and
here
we
halted
to
rest
my
convict
never
looked
at
me
except
once
while
we
were
in
the
hut
he
stood
before
the
fire
looking
thoughtfully
at
it
or
putting
up
his
feet
by
turns
upon
the
hob
suddenly
he
turned
to
the
sergeant
and
remarked
i
wish
to
say
something
respecting
this
escape
it
may
prevent
some
persons
laying
under
suspicion
alonger
me
you
can
say
what
you
like
returned
the
sergeant
standing
coolly
looking
at
him
with
his
arms
folded
but
you
have
no
call
to
say
it
here
have
opportunity
enough
to
say
about
it
and
hear
about
it
before
done
with
you
know
i
know
but
this
is
another
a
separate
matter
a
man
starve
at
least
i
took
some
wittles
up
at
the
village
over
the
church
stands
out
on
the
marshes
you
mean
stole
said
the
sergeant
and
tell
you
where
from
from
the
hallo
said
the
sergeant
staring
at
joe
hallo
pip
said
joe
staring
at
me
it
was
some
broken
what
it
a
dram
of
liquor
and
a
pie
have
you
happened
to
miss
such
an
article
as
a
pie
blacksmith
asked
the
sergeant
confidentially
my
wife
did
at
the
very
moment
when
you
came
in
you
know
pip
so
said
my
convict
turning
his
eyes
on
joe
in
a
moody
manner
and
without
the
least
glance
at
me
so
the
blacksmith
are
you
then
sorry
to
say
eat
your
pie
god
knows
welcome
to
far
as
it
was
ever
mine
returned
joe
with
a
saving
remembrance
of
joe
we
know
what
you
have
done
but
we
have
you
starve
to
death
for
it
poor
miserable
would
us
pip
something
that
i
had
noticed
before
clicked
in
the
throat
again
and
he
turned
his
back
the
boat
had
returned
and
his
guard
were
ready
so
we
followed
him
to
the
made
of
rough
stakes
and
stones
and
saw
him
put
into
the
boat
which
was
rowed
by
a
crew
of
convicts
like
himself
no
one
seemed
surprised
to
see
him
but
they
looked
at
him
stolidly
and
rowed
him
back
to
the
hulks
as
a
matter
of
course
my
state
of
mind
regarding
the
pie
was
curious
i
do
not
recall
that
i
felt
any
tenderness
of
conscience
in
reference
to
joe
when
the
fear
of
being
found
out
was
lifted
off
me
but
i
loved
for
no
better
reason
in
those
early
days
than
because
the
dear
fellow
let
me
love
as
to
him
my
inner
self
was
not
so
easily
composed
it
was
much
upon
my
mind
particularly
when
i
first
saw
him
looking
about
for
his
file
that
i
ought
to
tell
joe
the
whole
truth
yet
i
did
not
and
for
the
reason
that
i
mistrusted
that
if
i
did
he
would
think
me
worse
than
i
was
the
fear
of
losing
confidence
and
of
thenceforth
sitting
in
the
chimney
corner
at
night
staring
drearily
at
my
forever
lost
companion
and
friend
tied
up
my
tongue
and
so
the
whole
truth
never
came
out
pip
and
at
this
time
i
was
only
an
errand
boy
around
the
forge
and
my
education
was
limited
to
spelling
out
the
names
on
the
tombstones
so
in
the
evenings
they
sent
me
to
school
to
aunt
a
worthy
woman
who
used
to
go
to
sleep
regularly
from
six
to
seven
while
her
small
class
was
supposed
to
study
but
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
a
friend
in
her
granddaughter
biddy
she
was
about
my
own
age
and
while
her
shoes
were
generally
untied
and
her
hands
sometimes
dirty
her
heart
was
in
the
right
place
and
she
had
a
good
head
so
with
her
help
i
struggled
through
my
letters
as
if
they
had
been
a
getting
considerably
worried
and
scratched
by
each
letter
in
turn
then
came
the
dreaded
nine
figures
to
add
to
my
troubles
but
at
last
i
learned
to
read
and
cipher
i
do
not
know
which
was
the
prouder
joe
or
i
when
i
wrote
him
my
first
letter
which
was
hardly
needed
as
he
sat
beside
me
while
i
wrote
it
i
say
pip
old
chap
he
cried
opening
his
eyes
very
wide
what
a
scholar
you
are
you
i
should
like
to
be
i
answered
looking
at
the
slate
with
satisfaction
joe
made
occasional
trips
with
uncle
pumblechook
on
to
assist
him
in
buying
such
household
stuffs
and
goods
as
required
a
judgment
uncle
pumblechook
being
a
bachelor
and
reposing
no
confidences
in
his
domestic
servant
on
this
particular
evening
she
came
home
from
such
a
trip
bringing
uncle
pumblechook
with
her
now
said
she
unwrapping
herself
with
haste
and
excitement
and
throwing
her
bonnet
back
on
her
shoulders
where
it
hung
by
the
strings
if
this
boy
grateful
this
night
he
never
will
be
i
looked
as
grateful
as
any
boy
possibly
could
who
was
wholly
uninformed
why
he
ought
to
assume
that
expression
you
have
heard
of
miss
havisham
up
town
you
continued
my
sister
addressing
joe
she
wants
this
boy
to
go
and
play
there
and
of
course
going
and
he
had
play
there
said
my
sister
shaking
her
head
at
me
as
an
encouragement
to
be
extremely
light
and
sportive
or
work
him
i
had
heard
of
miss
havisham
up
for
miles
round
had
heard
of
miss
havisham
up
an
immensely
rich
and
grim
lady
who
lived
in
a
large
and
dismal
house
barricaded
against
robbers
and
who
led
a
life
of
seclusion
well
to
be
sure
said
joe
astounded
i
wonder
how
she
come
to
know
pip
noodle
cried
my
sister
who
said
she
knew
him
she
ask
uncle
pumblechook
if
he
knew
of
a
boy
to
go
and
play
there
and
uncle
pumblechook
being
always
considerate
and
thoughtful
of
us
mention
this
boy
that
i
have
been
a
willing
slave
to
and
uncle
pumblechook
being
sensible
that
for
anything
we
can
tell
this
fortune
may
be
made
by
his
going
to
miss
offer
to
take
him
into
town
in
his
own
and
to
keep
him
and
to
take
him
with
his
own
hands
to
miss
morning
and
me
cried
my
sister
casting
off
her
bonnet
in
sudden
desperation
here
i
stand
talking
to
mere
mooncalfs
with
uncle
pumblechook
waiting
and
the
mare
catching
cold
at
the
door
and
the
boy
grimed
with
dirt
from
the
hair
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
with
that
she
pounced
on
me
like
an
eagle
on
a
lamb
and
my
face
was
squeezed
into
wooden
bowls
in
sinks
and
my
head
was
put
under
taps
of
and
i
was
soaped
and
kneaded
and
towelled
and
thumped
and
harrowed
and
rasped
until
i
really
was
quite
beside
myself
when
my
ablutions
were
completed
i
was
put
into
clean
linen
of
the
stiffest
character
like
a
young
penitent
into
sackcloth
and
was
trussed
up
in
my
tightest
and
fearfullest
suit
i
was
then
delivered
over
to
pumblechook
who
formally
received
me
as
if
he
were
the
sheriff
saying
pompously
boy
be
forever
grateful
to
all
friends
but
especially
unto
them
which
brought
you
up
by
hand
joe
god
bless
you
pip
old
chap
i
had
never
parted
from
him
before
and
what
with
my
feelings
and
what
with
i
could
at
first
see
no
stars
from
the
but
they
twinkled
out
one
by
one
without
throwing
any
light
on
the
questions
as
to
why
on
earth
i
was
going
to
play
at
miss
and
what
on
earth
i
was
expected
to
play
at
i
spent
the
night
at
uncle
and
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
we
proceeded
to
miss
it
was
a
dismal
looking
house
with
a
great
many
iron
bars
to
it
some
of
the
windows
had
been
walled
up
and
the
others
were
rustily
barred
there
was
a
courtyard
in
front
which
was
also
barred
so
we
had
to
wait
after
ringing
the
bell
for
some
one
to
open
it
presently
a
window
was
raised
and
a
clear
voice
demanded
what
name
pumblechook
was
the
reply
the
voice
returned
quite
right
and
the
window
was
shut
again
and
a
young
lady
came
across
the
courtyard
with
keys
in
her
hand
this
said
pumblechook
is
pip
this
is
pip
is
it
returned
the
young
lady
who
was
very
pretty
and
seemed
very
proud
come
in
pip
pumblechook
was
coming
in
also
when
she
stopped
him
with
the
gate
oh
she
said
did
you
wish
to
see
miss
havisham
if
miss
havisham
wished
to
see
me
returned
pumblechook
discomfited
ah
said
the
girl
but
you
see
she
she
said
it
so
finally
and
in
such
an
undiscussible
way
that
pumblechook
though
in
a
condition
of
ruffled
dignity
could
not
protest
we
went
into
the
house
by
a
side
great
front
entrance
had
two
chains
across
it
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
that
the
passages
were
all
dark
and
that
she
had
left
a
candle
burning
there
she
took
it
up
and
we
went
through
more
passages
and
up
a
staircase
and
still
it
was
all
dark
and
only
the
candle
lighted
us
at
last
we
came
to
the
door
of
a
room
and
she
said
go
in
i
answered
more
in
shyness
than
politeness
after
you
miss
to
this
she
returned
be
ridiculous
boy
i
am
not
going
in
and
scornfully
walked
away
was
the
candle
with
her
this
was
very
uncomfortable
and
i
was
half
afraid
however
the
only
thing
to
do
being
to
knock
at
the
door
i
knocked
and
was
told
from
within
to
enter
i
entered
therefore
and
found
myself
in
a
pretty
large
room
well
lighted
with
wax
candles
no
glimpse
of
daylight
was
to
be
seen
in
it
it
was
a
as
i
supposed
from
the
furniture
though
much
of
it
was
of
forms
and
uses
then
quite
unknown
to
me
but
prominent
in
it
was
a
draped
table
with
a
gilded
and
that
i
made
out
at
first
sight
to
be
a
fine
in
an
with
an
elbow
resting
on
the
table
and
her
head
leaning
on
that
hand
sat
the
strangest
lady
i
have
ever
seen
or
shall
ever
see
she
was
dressed
in
rich
materials
and
lace
and
silks
of
white
her
shoes
were
white
and
she
had
a
long
white
veil
dependent
from
her
hair
and
she
had
bridal
flowers
in
her
hair
but
her
hair
was
white
some
bright
jewels
sparkled
on
her
neck
and
on
her
hands
and
some
other
jewels
lay
sparkling
on
the
table
dresses
less
splendid
than
the
dress
she
wore
and
trunks
were
scattered
about
she
had
not
quite
finished
dressing
for
she
had
but
one
shoe
on
other
was
on
the
table
near
her
hand
veil
was
but
half
arranged
her
watch
and
chain
were
not
put
on
and
her
handkerchief
gloves
some
flowers
and
a
lay
confusedly
heaped
about
the
who
is
it
said
the
lady
at
the
table
pip
pip
boy
play
look
at
me
said
miss
havisham
you
are
not
afraid
of
a
woman
who
has
never
seen
the
sun
since
you
were
born
i
regret
to
state
that
i
was
not
afraid
of
telling
the
enormous
lie
comprehended
in
the
answer
no
i
am
tired
said
miss
havisham
i
want
diversion
and
i
have
done
with
men
and
women
play
i
looked
foolish
and
bewildered
not
knowing
what
to
do
i
sometimes
have
sick
fancies
she
went
on
and
i
have
a
sick
fancy
that
i
want
to
see
some
play
there
there
with
an
impatient
movement
of
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
play
play
play
for
a
moment
with
the
fear
of
my
working
me
before
my
eyes
i
had
a
desperate
idea
of
starting
round
the
room
in
the
assumed
character
of
but
i
felt
myself
so
unequal
to
the
performance
that
i
gave
it
up
and
stood
looking
at
miss
havisham
in
what
i
suppose
she
took
for
a
dogged
manner
inasmuch
as
she
said
when
we
had
taken
a
good
look
at
each
other
are
you
sullen
and
obstinate
no
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
and
very
sorry
i
play
just
now
if
you
complain
of
me
i
shall
get
into
trouble
with
my
sister
so
i
would
do
it
if
i
could
but
so
new
here
and
so
strange
and
so
fine
and
i
stopped
fearing
i
might
say
too
much
call
estella
she
commanded
looking
at
me
you
can
do
that
to
stand
in
a
strange
house
calling
a
scornful
young
lady
by
her
first
name
was
almost
as
bad
as
playing
to
order
but
she
answered
at
last
my
dear
said
miss
havisham
let
me
see
you
play
cards
with
this
boy
what
do
you
play
boy
asked
estella
with
the
greatest
disdain
nothing
but
my
neighbor
miss
beggar
him
said
miss
havisham
to
estella
so
we
sat
down
to
cards
it
was
then
i
began
to
understand
that
everything
in
the
room
had
stopped
with
the
watch
and
the
clock
a
long
time
ago
i
noticed
that
miss
havisham
put
down
the
jewel
exactly
on
the
spot
from
which
she
had
taken
it
up
as
estella
dealt
the
cards
i
glanced
at
the
again
and
saw
that
the
shoe
upon
it
once
white
now
yellow
had
never
been
worn
he
calls
the
knaves
jacks
this
boy
said
estella
with
disdain
before
our
first
game
was
out
and
what
coarse
hands
he
has
and
what
thick
boots
i
had
never
thought
of
being
ashamed
of
my
hands
before
but
now
i
began
to
consider
them
her
contempt
for
me
was
so
strong
that
i
caught
it
she
won
the
game
and
i
dealt
i
misdealt
as
was
only
natural
when
i
knew
she
was
lying
in
wait
for
me
to
do
wrong
and
she
denounced
me
for
a
stupid
clumsy
you
say
nothing
of
her
remarked
miss
havisham
to
me
as
she
looked
on
she
says
many
hard
things
of
you
but
you
say
nothing
of
her
what
do
you
think
of
her
i
like
to
say
i
stammered
tell
me
in
my
ear
said
miss
havisham
bending
down
i
think
she
is
very
proud
i
replied
in
a
whisper
anything
else
i
think
she
is
very
pretty
anything
else
i
think
she
is
very
insulting
she
was
looking
at
me
then
with
a
look
of
supreme
aversion
anything
else
i
think
i
should
like
to
go
home
you
shall
go
soon
said
miss
havisham
aloud
play
the
game
out
i
played
the
game
to
an
end
with
estella
and
she
beggared
me
she
threw
the
cards
down
on
the
table
when
she
had
won
them
all
as
if
she
despised
them
for
having
been
won
of
me
when
shall
i
have
you
here
again
said
miss
havisham
let
me
think
i
know
nothing
of
days
of
the
week
or
of
weeks
of
the
year
come
again
after
six
days
you
hear
yes
estella
take
him
down
let
him
have
something
to
eat
and
let
him
roam
and
look
about
him
while
he
eats
go
pip
i
followed
the
candle
down
as
i
had
followed
the
candle
up
and
she
stood
it
in
the
place
where
we
had
found
it
until
she
opened
the
side
entrance
i
had
fancied
without
thinking
about
it
that
it
must
necessarily
be
the
rush
of
the
daylight
quite
confounded
me
and
made
me
feel
as
if
i
had
been
in
the
of
the
strange
room
many
hours
when
i
reached
home
my
sister
was
very
curious
to
know
all
about
miss
havisham
and
what
i
had
seen
and
done
at
her
house
uncle
pumblechook
too
came
hurrying
over
armed
with
many
questions
i
was
naturally
a
truthful
boys
i
knew
instinctively
that
i
could
not
make
myself
understood
about
that
strange
visit
so
i
try
when
he
fired
his
first
question
as
to
what
was
miss
havisham
like
very
tall
and
dark
i
told
him
is
she
uncle
asked
my
sister
pumblechook
winked
assent
from
which
i
at
once
inferred
that
he
had
never
seen
miss
havisham
for
she
was
nothing
of
the
kind
good
said
pumblechook
conceitedly
now
boy
what
was
she
a
doing
of
when
you
went
in
he
continued
she
was
sitting
i
answered
in
a
black
velvet
coach
pumblechook
and
joe
stared
at
one
they
well
both
repeated
in
a
black
velvet
coach
yes
said
i
and
miss
her
niece
i
her
in
cake
and
wine
at
the
on
a
gold
plate
and
we
all
had
cake
and
wine
on
gold
plates
and
i
got
up
behind
the
coach
to
eat
mine
because
she
told
me
to
was
anybody
else
there
asked
pumblechook
four
dogs
said
i
large
or
small
immense
said
i
and
they
fought
for
veal
cutlets
out
of
a
silver
basket
pumblechook
and
joe
stared
at
one
another
again
in
utter
amazement
i
was
perfectly
reckless
witness
under
the
would
have
told
them
anything
where
this
coach
in
the
name
of
gracious
asked
my
sister
in
miss
room
they
stared
again
but
there
any
horses
to
it
i
added
this
saving
clause
in
the
moment
of
rejecting
four
richly
caparisoned
coursers
which
i
had
had
wild
thoughts
of
harnessing
can
this
be
possible
uncle
asked
joe
what
can
the
boy
mean
tell
you
mum
said
pumblechook
my
opinion
is
a
flighty
you
flighty
enough
to
pass
her
days
in
a
did
you
ever
see
her
in
it
uncle
asked
joe
how
could
i
he
returned
forced
to
the
admission
when
i
never
see
her
in
my
life
never
clapped
eyes
upon
her
goodness
uncle
and
yet
you
have
spoken
to
her
just
through
the
door
he
replied
testily
now
boy
what
did
you
play
we
played
with
flags
flags
echoed
my
sister
yes
said
i
estella
waved
a
blue
flag
and
i
waved
a
red
one
and
miss
havisham
waved
one
sprinkled
all
over
with
little
gold
stars
out
at
the
and
then
we
all
waved
our
swords
and
hurrahed
swords
repeated
my
sister
where
did
you
get
swords
from
out
of
a
cupboard
said
i
and
i
saw
pistols
in
pills
and
there
was
no
daylight
in
the
room
but
it
was
all
lighted
up
with
candles
true
mum
said
pumblechook
with
a
grave
nod
the
state
of
the
case
for
that
much
seen
myself
and
then
they
both
stared
at
me
and
i
at
them
and
plaited
the
right
leg
of
my
trousers
with
my
right
hand
if
they
had
asked
me
any
more
questions
i
should
undoubtedly
have
betrayed
myself
for
i
was
even
then
on
the
point
of
mentioning
that
there
was
a
balloon
in
the
yard
and
should
have
hazarded
the
statement
but
for
my
invention
being
divided
between
that
phenomenon
and
a
bear
they
were
so
much
occupied
however
in
discussing
the
marvels
i
had
already
presented
for
their
consideration
that
i
escaped
the
subject
still
held
them
when
joe
came
in
from
his
work
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
to
whom
my
sister
more
for
the
relief
of
her
own
mind
than
for
the
gratification
of
his
related
my
pretended
experiences
now
when
i
saw
joe
open
his
blue
eyes
and
roll
them
all
round
the
kitchen
in
helpless
amazement
i
was
overtaken
by
penitence
but
only
as
regarded
in
the
least
as
regarded
the
other
two
towards
joe
and
joe
only
i
considered
myself
a
young
monster
while
they
sat
debating
what
results
would
come
to
me
from
miss
acquaintance
and
favor
they
had
no
doubt
that
miss
havisham
would
do
something
for
me
their
doubts
related
to
the
form
that
something
would
take
my
sister
stood
out
for
property
pumblechook
was
in
favor
of
a
handsome
premium
for
binding
me
apprentice
to
some
genteel
trade
the
corn
and
seed
trade
for
instance
joe
fell
into
the
deepest
disgrace
with
both
for
offering
the
bright
suggestion
that
i
might
only
be
presented
with
one
of
the
dogs
who
had
fought
for
the
veal
cutlets
if
a
head
express
better
opinions
than
that
said
my
sister
and
you
have
got
any
work
to
do
you
had
better
go
and
do
it
so
he
went
after
pumblechook
had
driven
off
and
when
my
sister
was
washing
up
i
stole
into
the
forge
to
joe
and
remained
by
him
until
he
had
done
for
the
night
then
i
said
before
the
fire
goes
out
joe
i
should
like
to
tell
you
something
should
you
pip
said
joe
drawing
his
near
the
forge
then
tell
us
what
is
it
pip
joe
said
i
taking
hold
of
his
shirt
sleeve
and
twisting
it
between
my
finger
and
thumb
you
remember
all
that
about
miss
remember
said
joe
i
believe
you
wonderful
a
terrible
thing
joe
it
true
what
are
you
telling
of
pip
cried
joe
falling
back
in
the
greatest
amazement
you
mean
to
say
yes
i
do
lies
joe
but
not
all
of
it
why
sure
you
mean
to
say
pip
that
there
was
no
black
welwet
for
i
stood
shaking
my
head
but
at
least
there
was
dogs
pip
come
pip
said
joe
persuasively
if
there
no
weal
cutlets
at
least
there
was
dogs
no
joe
dog
said
joe
a
puppy
come
no
joe
there
was
nothing
at
all
of
the
kind
as
i
fixed
my
eyes
hopelessly
on
joe
joe
contemplated
me
in
dismay
pip
old
chap
this
do
old
fellow
i
say
where
do
you
expect
to
go
to
terrible
joe
it
terrible
cried
joe
awful
what
possessed
you
i
know
what
possessed
me
joe
i
replied
letting
his
shirt
sleeve
go
and
sitting
down
in
the
ashes
at
his
feet
hanging
my
head
but
i
wish
you
taught
me
to
call
knaves
at
cards
jacks
and
i
wish
my
boots
so
thick
nor
my
hands
so
coarse
and
then
i
told
joe
that
i
felt
very
miserable
and
that
i
been
able
to
explain
myself
to
joe
and
pumblechook
and
that
there
had
been
a
beautiful
young
lady
at
miss
who
was
dreadfully
proud
and
that
she
had
said
i
was
common
and
much
more
to
that
effect
one
thing
you
maybe
sure
of
pip
said
joe
after
some
rumination
namely
that
lies
is
lies
howsever
they
come
they
ought
to
come
and
they
come
from
the
father
of
lies
and
work
round
to
the
same
you
tell
no
more
of
pip
the
way
to
get
out
of
being
common
old
chap
and
as
to
being
common
i
make
it
out
at
all
clear
you
are
oncommon
in
some
things
oncommon
small
likewise
a
oncommon
scholar
no
i
am
ignorant
and
backward
joe
why
see
what
a
letter
you
wrote
last
night
wrote
in
print
even
seen
and
from
gentlefolks
swear
wrote
in
print
said
joe
i
have
learnt
next
to
nothing
joe
you
think
much
of
me
only
that
well
pip
said
joe
be
it
so
or
be
it
you
must
be
a
common
scholar
afore
you
can
be
a
oncommon
one
i
should
hope
the
king
upon
his
throne
with
his
crown
upon
his
sit
and
write
his
acts
of
parliament
in
print
without
having
begun
when
he
were
a
unpromoted
prince
with
the
added
joe
with
a
shake
of
the
head
that
was
full
of
meaning
and
begun
at
a
too
and
worked
his
way
to
z
there
was
some
hope
in
this
piece
of
wisdom
and
it
rather
encouraged
me
not
angry
with
me
joe
no
old
chap
but
you
might
bear
in
mind
about
them
dog
fights
and
weal
cutlets
when
you
say
your
prayers
all
old
chap
and
never
do
it
no
more
how
pip
fell
heir
to
great
the
happy
idea
occurred
to
me
a
morning
or
two
later
when
i
woke
that
the
best
step
i
could
take
towards
making
myself
uncommon
was
to
get
out
of
biddy
everything
she
knew
in
pursuance
of
this
idea
i
mentioned
to
biddy
when
i
went
to
at
night
that
i
had
a
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
get
on
in
life
and
that
i
should
feel
very
much
obliged
to
her
if
she
would
impart
all
her
learning
to
me
biddy
who
was
the
most
obliging
of
girls
immediately
said
she
would
and
indeed
began
to
carry
out
her
promise
within
five
minutes
the
books
at
the
school
were
few
and
ragged
but
we
attacked
them
all
valiantly
during
the
course
of
the
winter
and
even
refreshed
our
budding
minds
with
newspaper
scraps
and
with
every
new
piece
of
knowledge
i
could
fancy
myself
saying
to
miss
estella
now
am
i
common
at
the
appointed
time
i
returned
to
miss
and
my
hesitating
ring
at
the
gate
brought
out
estella
you
are
to
come
this
way
she
said
after
admitting
me
and
took
me
to
quite
another
part
of
the
house
we
went
in
at
a
door
which
stood
open
and
into
a
gloomy
room
with
a
low
ceiling
on
the
ground
floor
at
the
back
there
was
some
company
in
the
room
and
estella
said
to
me
as
she
joined
it
you
are
to
go
and
stand
there
boy
till
you
are
wanted
there
being
the
window
i
crossed
to
it
and
stood
there
in
a
very
uncomfortable
state
of
mind
looking
out
presently
she
brought
a
candle
and
led
the
way
down
a
dark
passage
to
a
staircase
as
we
went
up
the
stairs
we
met
a
man
coming
down
he
was
large
and
bald
with
bushy
black
eyebrows
and
eyes
which
were
disagreeably
keen
he
was
nothing
to
me
at
the
time
and
yet
i
help
observe
him
he
stopped
and
looked
at
me
how
do
come
here
he
asked
miss
havisham
sent
for
me
sir
i
explained
well
behave
yourself
i
have
a
pretty
large
experience
of
boys
and
a
bad
set
of
fellows
now
mind
said
he
biting
the
side
of
his
great
forefinger
as
he
frowned
at
me
you
behave
yourself
with
those
words
he
released
i
was
glad
of
for
his
hand
smelt
of
scented
went
his
way
downstairs
i
wondered
whether
he
could
be
a
doctor
but
no
i
thought
he
be
a
doctor
or
he
would
have
a
quieter
manner
there
was
not
much
time
to
consider
the
subject
for
we
were
soon
in
miss
room
where
she
and
everything
else
were
just
as
i
had
left
them
estella
left
me
standing
near
the
door
and
i
stood
there
until
miss
havisham
cast
her
eyes
upon
me
from
the
so
she
said
without
being
startled
or
surprised
the
days
have
worn
away
have
they
yes
there
there
there
with
the
impatient
movement
of
her
fingers
i
want
to
know
are
you
ready
to
play
i
was
obliged
to
answer
in
some
confusion
i
think
i
am
not
at
cards
again
she
demanded
with
a
searching
look
yes
i
could
do
that
if
i
was
wanted
since
this
house
strikes
you
old
and
grave
boy
said
miss
havisham
impatiently
and
you
are
unwilling
to
play
are
you
willing
to
work
i
could
answer
this
inquiry
with
a
better
heart
than
i
had
been
able
to
find
for
the
other
question
and
i
said
i
was
quite
willing
then
go
into
that
opposite
room
said
she
pointing
at
the
door
behind
me
with
her
withered
hand
and
wait
there
till
i
come
i
did
so
and
after
hearing
mice
scamper
about
the
faintly
lighted
room
for
a
few
minutes
miss
havisham
entered
and
laid
a
hand
upon
my
shoulder
in
her
other
hand
she
had
a
stick
on
which
she
leaned
and
she
looked
like
the
witch
of
the
place
this
said
she
pointing
to
the
long
table
with
her
stick
is
where
i
will
be
laid
when
i
am
dead
they
shall
come
and
look
at
me
here
with
some
vague
misgiving
that
she
might
get
upon
the
table
then
and
there
and
die
at
once
the
complete
realization
of
the
ghastly
at
the
fair
i
shrank
under
her
touch
what
do
you
think
that
is
she
asked
me
again
pointing
with
her
stick
that
where
those
cobwebs
are
i
guess
what
it
is
a
great
cake
a
mine
she
looked
all
around
the
room
in
a
glaring
manner
and
then
said
leaning
on
me
while
her
hand
twitched
my
shoulder
come
come
come
walk
me
walk
me
from
this
i
made
out
that
the
work
i
had
to
do
was
to
walk
miss
havisham
round
and
round
the
room
so
i
started
at
once
she
following
at
a
fitful
speed
twitching
the
hand
upon
my
shoulder
after
a
while
she
said
call
estella
and
i
did
so
then
the
company
i
had
noticed
before
filed
in
and
paid
their
respects
which
miss
havisham
hardly
seemed
to
hear
while
estella
was
away
lighting
them
down
miss
havisham
still
walked
with
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
but
more
and
more
slowly
at
last
she
stopped
before
the
fire
and
said
after
muttering
and
looking
at
it
some
seconds
this
is
my
birthday
pip
i
was
going
to
wish
her
many
happy
returns
when
she
lifted
her
stick
i
suffer
it
to
be
spoken
of
i
suffer
those
who
were
here
just
now
or
any
one
to
speak
of
it
they
come
here
on
the
day
but
they
dare
not
refer
to
it
of
course
made
no
further
effort
to
refer
to
it
on
this
day
of
the
year
long
before
you
were
born
this
heap
of
decay
stabbing
with
her
crutched
stick
at
the
pile
of
cobwebs
on
the
table
but
not
touching
it
was
brought
here
it
and
i
have
worn
away
together
the
mice
have
gnawed
at
it
and
sharper
teeth
than
teeth
of
mice
have
gnawed
at
me
she
held
the
head
of
her
stick
against
her
heart
as
she
stood
looking
at
the
table
she
in
her
once
white
dress
all
yellow
and
withered
the
once
white
cloth
all
yellow
and
withered
everything
around
in
a
state
to
crumble
under
a
touch
when
the
ruin
is
complete
said
she
with
a
ghastly
look
and
when
they
lay
me
dead
in
my
dress
on
the
shall
be
done
and
which
will
be
the
finished
curse
upon
much
the
better
if
it
is
done
on
this
day
she
stood
looking
at
the
table
as
if
she
stood
looking
at
her
own
figure
lying
there
i
remained
quiet
estella
returned
and
she
too
remained
quiet
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
continued
thus
a
long
time
in
the
heavy
air
of
the
room
and
the
heavy
darkness
that
brooded
in
its
remoter
corners
i
even
had
an
alarming
fancy
that
estella
and
i
might
presently
crumble
to
dust
and
thus
passed
my
second
visit
to
miss
on
my
next
visit
the
following
week
i
saw
a
light
chair
on
wheels
that
you
pushed
from
behind
i
entered
that
same
day
on
a
regular
occupation
of
pushing
miss
havisham
in
this
chair
when
she
was
tired
of
walking
with
her
hand
upon
my
shoulder
round
her
own
room
and
across
the
landing
and
round
the
other
room
over
and
over
and
over
again
we
would
make
these
journeys
and
sometimes
they
would
last
as
long
as
three
hours
at
a
stretch
i
insensibly
fall
into
a
general
mention
of
these
journeys
as
numerous
because
it
was
at
once
settled
that
i
should
return
every
alternate
day
at
noon
for
these
purposes
and
because
i
am
now
going
to
sum
up
a
period
of
at
least
eight
or
ten
months
as
we
began
to
be
more
used
to
one
another
miss
havisham
talked
more
to
me
and
asked
me
such
questions
as
what
had
i
learned
and
what
was
i
going
to
be
i
told
her
i
was
going
to
be
apprenticed
to
joe
i
believed
and
i
enlarged
upon
my
knowing
nothing
and
wanting
to
know
everything
in
the
hope
that
she
might
offer
some
help
towards
that
desirable
end
but
she
did
not
on
the
contrary
she
seemed
to
prefer
my
being
ignorant
neither
did
she
ever
give
me
any
money
nor
anything
but
my
daily
dinner
estella
was
always
there
to
let
me
in
and
out
sometimes
she
would
coldly
tolerate
me
sometimes
she
would
condescend
to
me
sometimes
she
would
be
quite
familiar
with
me
sometimes
she
would
say
she
hated
me
but
always
my
admiration
for
her
grew
apace
and
i
was
the
more
firmly
resolved
not
to
be
common
there
was
a
song
joe
used
to
hum
fragments
of
at
the
forge
of
which
the
burden
was
old
clem
this
was
not
a
very
ceremonious
way
of
rendering
homage
to
a
patron
saint
for
i
believe
old
clem
stood
in
that
relation
towards
smiths
it
was
a
song
that
imitated
the
measure
of
beating
upon
iron
and
was
a
mere
lyrical
excuse
for
the
introduction
of
old
respected
name
thus
you
were
to
hammer
boys
clem
with
a
thump
and
a
clem
beat
it
out
beat
it
clem
with
a
clink
for
the
clem
blow
the
fire
blow
the
clem
roaring
dryer
soaring
clem
one
day
soon
after
the
appearance
of
the
chair
miss
havisham
suddenly
saying
to
me
with
the
impatient
movement
of
her
fingers
there
there
there
sing
i
was
surprised
into
crooning
this
ditty
as
i
pushed
her
over
the
floor
it
happened
so
to
catch
her
fancy
that
she
took
it
up
in
a
low
brooding
voice
as
if
she
were
singing
in
her
sleep
after
that
it
became
customary
with
us
to
have
it
as
we
moved
about
and
estella
would
often
join
in
though
the
whole
strain
was
so
subdued
even
when
there
were
three
of
us
that
it
made
less
noise
in
the
grim
old
house
than
the
lightest
breath
of
wind
what
could
i
become
with
these
surroundings
how
could
my
character
fail
to
be
influenced
by
them
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
if
my
thoughts
were
dazed
as
my
eyes
were
when
i
came
out
into
the
natural
light
from
the
misty
yellow
rooms
perhaps
i
might
have
talked
it
all
over
with
joe
had
it
not
been
for
those
enormous
tales
about
coaches
dogs
and
veal
cutlets
but
i
felt
a
natural
shrinking
from
having
miss
havisham
and
estella
discussed
which
had
come
upon
me
in
the
beginning
and
which
grew
much
more
potent
as
time
went
on
i
reposed
complete
confidence
in
no
one
but
biddy
and
so
i
told
her
everything
why
it
came
natural
for
me
to
do
so
and
why
biddy
had
a
deep
concern
in
everything
i
told
her
i
did
not
know
then
though
i
think
i
know
now
we
went
on
in
this
way
for
a
long
time
and
it
seemed
likely
that
we
should
continue
to
go
on
in
this
way
for
a
long
time
when
one
day
miss
havisham
stopped
short
as
she
and
i
were
walking
she
leaning
on
my
shoulder
and
said
with
some
displeasure
you
are
growing
tall
pip
she
said
no
more
at
the
time
but
she
presently
stopped
and
looked
at
me
again
and
presently
again
and
after
that
looked
frowning
and
moody
on
the
next
day
of
my
attendance
when
our
usual
exercise
was
over
and
i
had
landed
her
at
her
she
stayed
me
with
a
movement
of
her
impatient
fingers
tell
me
the
name
again
of
that
blacksmith
of
yours
joe
gargery
meaning
the
master
you
were
to
be
apprenticed
to
yes
miss
havisham
you
had
better
be
apprenticed
at
once
would
gargery
come
here
with
you
and
bring
your
indentures
do
you
think
i
signified
that
i
had
no
doubt
he
would
take
it
as
an
honor
to
be
asked
then
let
him
come
at
any
particular
time
miss
havisham
there
there
i
know
nothing
about
times
let
him
come
soon
and
come
alone
with
you
so
on
my
very
next
visit
i
conducted
joe
stiffly
arrayed
in
his
sunday
clothes
into
miss
presence
she
asked
him
several
questions
about
himself
and
my
apprenticeship
while
the
poor
fellow
twisted
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
persisted
in
answering
i
am
afraid
i
was
the
least
bit
ashamed
of
him
when
i
saw
that
estella
stood
at
the
back
of
miss
chair
and
that
her
eyes
laughed
mischievously
miss
havisham
glanced
at
him
as
if
she
understood
what
he
really
was
better
than
i
had
thought
possible
seeing
what
an
awkward
figure
he
cut
and
took
up
a
little
bag
from
the
table
beside
her
pip
has
earned
a
premium
here
she
said
and
here
it
is
there
are
guineas
in
this
bag
give
it
to
your
master
pip
as
if
he
were
absolutely
out
of
his
mind
with
the
wonder
awakened
in
him
by
her
strange
figure
and
the
strange
room
joe
even
at
this
pass
persisted
in
addressing
me
this
is
wery
liberal
on
your
part
pip
said
joe
and
it
is
as
such
received
and
grateful
welcome
though
never
looked
for
far
nor
near
nor
nowheres
and
now
old
chap
may
we
do
our
duty
may
you
and
me
do
our
duty
both
on
us
by
one
and
another
and
by
them
which
your
liberal
the
satisfaction
of
as
here
joe
showed
that
he
felt
he
had
fallen
into
frightful
difficulties
until
he
triumphantly
rescued
himself
with
the
words
and
from
myself
far
be
it
these
words
had
such
a
round
and
convincing
sound
for
him
that
he
said
them
twice
pip
said
miss
havisham
after
my
papers
were
signed
let
them
out
estella
am
i
to
come
again
miss
havisham
i
asked
no
gargery
is
your
master
now
gargery
one
word
thus
calling
him
back
as
i
went
out
of
the
door
i
heard
her
say
to
joe
in
a
distinct
emphatic
voice
the
boy
has
been
a
good
boy
here
and
that
is
his
reward
of
course
as
an
honest
man
you
will
expect
no
other
and
no
more
how
joe
got
out
of
the
room
i
have
never
been
able
to
determine
but
i
know
that
when
he
did
get
out
he
was
steadily
proceeding
upstairs
instead
of
coming
down
and
was
deaf
to
all
remonstrances
until
i
went
after
him
and
laid
hold
of
him
in
another
minute
we
were
outside
the
gate
and
it
was
locked
and
estella
was
gone
when
we
stood
in
the
daylight
alone
again
joe
backed
up
against
a
wall
and
said
to
me
astonishing
and
there
he
remained
so
long
saying
astonishing
at
intervals
so
often
that
i
began
to
think
his
senses
were
never
coming
back
at
length
he
prolonged
his
remark
into
pip
i
do
assure
you
this
is
and
so
by
degrees
became
able
to
walk
away
it
is
a
most
miserable
thing
to
feel
ashamed
of
home
there
may
be
black
ingratitude
in
the
thing
and
the
punishment
may
be
retributive
and
well
deserved
but
that
it
is
a
miserable
thing
i
can
testify
home
had
never
been
a
pleasant
place
to
me
because
of
my
temper
but
joe
had
sanctified
it
and
i
believed
in
it
i
had
believed
in
the
best
parlor
as
a
most
elegant
place
i
had
believed
in
the
front
door
as
a
mysterious
portal
of
the
temple
of
state
whose
solemn
opening
was
attended
with
a
sacrifice
of
roast
fowls
i
had
believed
in
the
kitchen
as
a
chaste
though
not
magnificent
apartment
i
had
believed
in
the
forge
as
the
glowing
road
to
manhood
and
independence
within
a
single
year
all
this
was
changed
now
it
was
all
coarse
and
common
and
i
would
not
have
had
miss
havisham
and
estella
see
it
on
any
account
how
much
of
my
ungracious
condition
of
mind
may
have
been
my
own
fault
how
much
miss
how
much
my
is
now
of
no
moment
to
me
or
to
any
one
the
change
was
made
in
me
the
thing
was
done
once
it
had
seemed
to
me
that
when
i
should
at
last
roll
up
my
and
go
into
the
forge
apprentice
i
should
be
distinguished
and
happy
now
that
the
reality
was
here
i
only
felt
that
i
was
dusty
with
the
dust
of
and
that
i
had
a
weight
upon
my
daily
remembrance
to
which
the
anvil
was
a
feather
i
remember
that
at
a
later
period
of
my
time
i
used
to
stand
about
the
churchyard
on
sunday
evenings
when
night
was
falling
comparing
my
own
perspective
with
the
windy
marsh
view
and
making
out
some
likeness
between
them
by
thinking
how
flat
and
low
both
were
and
how
on
both
there
came
an
unknown
way
and
a
dark
mist
and
then
the
sea
i
was
quite
as
dejected
on
the
first
of
my
apprenticeship
as
in
that
but
i
am
glad
to
know
that
i
never
breathed
a
murmur
to
joe
while
my
indentures
lasted
it
is
about
the
only
thing
i
glad
to
know
of
myself
in
that
connection
for
though
it
includes
what
i
proceed
to
add
all
the
merit
was
it
was
not
because
i
was
faithful
but
because
joe
was
faithful
that
i
never
ran
away
and
went
for
a
soldier
or
a
sailor
it
was
not
because
i
had
a
strong
sense
of
the
virtue
of
industry
but
because
of
joe
that
i
worked
with
tolerable
zeal
against
the
grain
as
i
was
getting
too
big
for
room
my
education
under
that
lady
ended
not
however
until
biddy
had
imparted
to
me
everything
she
knew
from
the
little
catalogue
of
prices
to
a
comic
song
she
had
once
bought
for
a
although
the
only
coherent
part
of
the
latter
piece
were
the
opening
lines
when
i
went
to
lunnon
town
sirs
too
rul
loo
rul
too
rul
loo
rul
was
i
done
very
brown
sirs
too
rul
loo
rul
too
rul
loo
rul
in
my
desire
to
be
wiser
i
got
this
composition
by
heart
with
the
utmost
gravity
nor
do
i
recollect
that
i
questioned
its
merit
except
that
i
thought
as
i
still
do
the
amount
of
too
rul
somewhat
in
excess
of
the
poetry
thus
matters
went
until
i
reached
the
fourth
year
of
my
apprenticeship
and
they
bade
fair
to
end
that
way
but
for
an
unusual
event
i
had
gone
with
joe
one
saturday
night
to
a
neighboring
tavern
to
join
some
friends
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
a
strange
gentleman
who
had
been
listening
to
us
stepped
between
us
and
the
fire
and
said
i
understand
that
one
of
you
is
a
blacksmith
by
name
joseph
gargery
which
is
the
man
here
is
the
man
said
joe
you
have
an
apprentice
pursued
the
stranger
commonly
known
as
pip
is
he
here
here
i
answered
the
stranger
did
not
recognize
me
but
i
did
recognize
him
as
the
man
i
had
once
met
on
the
stair
at
miss
i
wish
to
have
a
private
talk
with
you
both
he
said
perhaps
we
had
better
go
to
your
house
so
in
a
wondering
silence
we
left
the
inn
and
walked
home
where
joe
vaguely
recognizing
the
occasion
to
be
important
opened
the
front
door
and
ushered
us
into
the
state
parlor
the
stranger
told
us
that
he
was
a
lawyer
in
london
and
was
now
acting
as
confidential
agent
for
some
one
else
he
wished
to
purchase
my
apprenticeship
papers
from
joe
if
joe
were
willing
to
release
me
lord
forbid
that
i
should
want
anything
for
not
standing
in
way
said
joe
staring
lord
forbidding
is
pious
but
not
to
the
purpose
returned
the
lawyer
the
question
is
would
you
want
anything
do
you
want
anything
the
answer
is
returned
joe
sternly
no
then
i
am
instructed
to
communicate
to
him
said
jaggers
throwing
his
finger
at
me
sideways
that
he
will
come
into
a
handsome
property
further
that
it
is
the
desire
of
the
present
possessor
of
that
property
that
he
be
immediately
removed
from
his
present
sphere
of
life
and
from
this
place
and
be
brought
up
as
a
a
word
as
a
young
fellow
of
great
expectations
my
dream
was
out
my
wild
fancy
was
surpassed
by
sober
reality
miss
havisham
was
going
to
make
my
fortune
on
a
grand
scale
least
so
i
thought
at
the
time
now
pip
pursued
the
lawyer
i
address
the
rest
of
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
you
are
to
understand
first
that
it
is
the
request
of
the
person
from
whom
i
take
my
instructions
that
you
always
bear
the
name
of
pip
you
will
have
no
objection
i
dare
say
to
that
easy
condition
but
if
you
have
any
objection
this
is
the
time
to
mention
it
i
gasped
but
had
no
objection
the
second
condition
he
resumed
is
that
you
are
not
to
know
the
name
of
your
benefactor
for
the
present
i
will
act
as
your
guardian
and
see
that
you
are
educated
properly
you
desire
an
education
you
i
replied
that
i
had
always
longed
for
it
good
then
we
will
see
to
getting
you
a
tutor
but
first
you
should
have
some
new
clothes
to
come
away
in
when
will
you
be
ready
to
leave
say
this
day
week
want
some
money
shall
i
leave
you
twenty
guineas
he
produced
a
long
purse
with
the
greatest
coolness
and
counted
them
out
on
the
table
and
pushed
them
over
to
me
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
taken
his
leg
from
the
chair
he
sat
astride
of
the
chair
when
he
had
pushed
the
money
over
and
sat
swinging
his
purse
and
eyeing
joe
well
joseph
gargery
you
look
dumbfoundered
i
said
joe
in
a
very
decided
manner
it
was
understood
that
you
wanted
nothing
for
yourself
remember
it
were
understood
said
joe
and
it
understood
and
it
ever
will
be
similar
according
but
what
said
the
lawyer
swinging
his
purse
what
if
it
was
in
my
instructions
to
make
you
a
present
as
compensation
as
compensation
what
for
joe
demanded
for
the
loss
of
his
services
joe
laid
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
with
the
touch
of
a
woman
i
have
often
thought
of
him
since
like
the
that
can
crush
a
man
or
pat
an
in
his
combination
of
strength
with
gentleness
pip
is
that
hearty
welcome
said
joe
to
go
free
with
his
services
to
honor
and
as
no
words
can
tell
him
but
if
you
think
as
money
can
make
compensation
to
me
for
the
loss
of
the
little
come
to
the
ever
the
best
of
oh
dear
good
joe
whom
i
was
so
ready
to
leave
and
so
unthankful
to
i
see
you
again
with
your
muscular
arm
before
your
eyes
and
your
broad
chest
heaving
and
your
voice
dying
away
oh
dear
good
faithful
tender
joe
i
feel
the
loving
tremble
of
your
hand
upon
my
arm
as
solemnly
this
day
as
if
it
had
been
the
rustle
of
an
wing
but
at
the
time
i
was
lost
in
the
mazes
of
my
future
fortunes
and
could
not
retrace
the
we
had
trodden
together
i
begged
joe
to
be
comforted
joe
scooped
his
eyes
with
his
disengaged
wrist
as
if
he
were
bent
on
gouging
himself
but
said
not
another
word
after
the
lawyer
had
taken
his
leave
joe
and
i
went
into
the
kitchen
where
we
found
biddy
and
my
sister
and
told
them
of
my
good
fortune
they
dropped
their
sewing
and
looked
at
me
joe
held
his
knees
and
looked
at
me
i
looked
at
them
in
turn
after
a
pause
they
heartily
congratulated
me
but
there
was
a
certain
touch
of
sadness
in
their
congratulations
that
i
rather
resented
now
that
i
was
actually
going
away
i
became
quite
gloomy
i
did
not
know
why
but
i
sat
in
the
chimney
corner
looking
at
the
fire
my
elbow
on
my
knee
and
while
the
others
tried
to
make
the
conversation
cheerful
i
grew
gloomier
than
ever
but
the
bright
sunlight
of
the
next
morning
dispelled
my
doubts
and
fears
and
i
began
to
count
the
days
eagerly
i
went
down
to
the
and
got
measured
for
a
wonderful
suit
of
clothes
much
to
the
consternation
of
boy
who
thought
himself
equal
to
any
blacksmith
that
ever
lived
then
i
went
to
the
and
the
and
the
and
felt
rather
like
mother
dog
whose
outfit
required
the
services
of
so
many
trades
i
also
went
to
the
and
took
my
place
for
seven
saturday
morning
and
everywhere
about
the
village
the
news
of
my
great
expectations
preceded
me
and
i
was
heartily
stared
at
uncle
pumblechook
was
especially
officious
at
this
time
he
acted
as
though
he
were
the
sole
cause
of
all
this
to
think
said
he
swelling
up
that
i
should
have
been
the
humble
instrument
of
this
proud
reward
he
thought
like
all
the
rest
of
us
that
miss
havisham
was
my
unknown
benefactor
it
was
a
natural
mistake
as
she
had
been
kind
to
me
in
her
way
and
i
had
seen
the
lawyer
at
her
house
but
it
was
a
mistake
after
all
and
led
to
other
unhappy
blunders
ere
i
learned
the
truth
for
many
years
afterward
i
found
that
my
convict
man
i
had
helped
down
in
the
none
other
than
the
friend
who
had
left
me
this
fortune
he
had
escaped
again
from
the
hulks
and
coming
into
a
considerable
property
had
arranged
with
the
lawyer
to
use
it
in
making
a
gentleman
out
of
the
little
boy
he
had
found
crying
on
the
tombstone
but
as
i
say
none
of
us
knew
it
or
suspected
it
at
first
and
now
those
six
days
which
were
to
have
run
out
so
slowly
had
run
out
fast
and
were
gone
and
looked
me
in
the
face
more
steadily
than
i
could
look
at
it
as
the
six
evenings
had
dwindled
away
to
five
to
four
to
three
to
two
i
had
become
more
and
more
appreciative
of
the
society
of
joe
and
my
sister
and
biddy
on
this
last
evening
i
dressed
myself
out
in
my
new
clothes
for
their
delight
and
sat
in
my
splendor
until
bedtime
we
had
a
hot
supper
on
the
occasion
graced
by
the
inevitable
roast
fowl
and
we
had
some
flip
to
finish
with
we
were
all
very
low
and
none
the
higher
for
pretending
to
be
in
spirits
it
was
a
hurried
breakfast
the
next
morning
with
no
taste
in
it
i
got
up
from
the
meal
saying
with
a
sort
of
briskness
as
if
it
had
only
just
occurred
to
me
well
i
suppose
i
must
be
off
and
then
i
kissed
my
sister
and
kissed
biddy
and
threw
my
arms
around
neck
then
i
took
up
my
little
portmanteau
and
walked
out
the
last
i
saw
of
them
was
when
i
presently
heard
a
scuffle
behind
me
and
looking
back
saw
joe
throwing
an
old
shoe
after
me
and
biddy
throwing
another
old
shoe
i
stopped
then
to
wave
my
hat
and
dear
old
joe
waved
his
strong
right
arm
above
his
head
crying
huskily
hooroar
and
biddy
put
her
apron
to
her
face
i
walked
away
at
a
good
pace
thinking
it
was
easier
to
go
than
i
had
supposed
it
would
be
and
reflecting
that
it
would
never
have
done
to
have
an
old
shoe
thrown
after
the
coach
in
sight
of
all
the
i
whistled
and
made
nothing
of
going
but
the
village
was
very
peaceful
and
quiet
and
the
light
mists
were
solemnly
rising
as
if
to
show
me
the
world
and
i
had
been
so
innocent
and
little
there
and
all
beyond
was
so
unknown
and
great
that
in
a
moment
with
a
strong
heave
and
sob
i
broke
into
tears
it
was
by
the
at
the
end
of
the
village
and
i
laid
my
hand
upon
it
and
said
oh
my
dear
dear
friend
so
subdued
was
i
by
those
tears
that
when
i
was
on
the
coach
and
it
was
clear
of
the
town
i
deliberated
with
an
aching
heart
whether
i
would
not
get
down
when
we
changed
horses
and
walk
back
and
have
another
evening
at
home
and
a
better
parting
but
while
i
deliberated
we
had
changed
and
changed
again
and
it
was
now
too
late
and
too
far
to
go
back
and
i
went
on
and
the
mists
had
all
solemnly
risen
now
and
the
world
lay
spread
before
me
my
boyhood
was
over
henceforth
i
was
to
play
a
man
with
great
expectations
story
of
little
illustration
little
dorrit
the
child
of
the
some
years
ago
when
the
laws
of
england
were
harsher
than
they
are
now
there
were
prisons
or
big
gloomy
jails
into
which
men
were
put
if
they
pay
what
they
owed
this
was
cruel
and
unjust
for
the
prisoner
was
of
course
cut
off
from
the
chance
to
earn
any
more
money
and
so
he
might
linger
there
for
years
or
even
his
whole
life
long
if
some
friend
did
not
come
to
his
relief
but
otherwise
the
prisoner
was
given
many
liberties
not
found
in
ordinary
jails
his
family
might
live
with
him
if
they
chose
and
come
and
go
as
they
pleased
one
of
the
largest
of
these
prisons
was
called
the
marshalsea
one
day
a
gentleman
was
brought
there
who
had
lost
his
money
in
business
but
so
confident
was
he
of
speedily
regaining
his
liberty
that
he
would
not
unpack
his
valise
at
first
his
name
was
william
dorrit
an
man
who
had
spent
his
money
freely
and
paid
little
attention
to
his
bills
now
that
he
had
fallen
upon
evil
days
he
thought
that
his
friends
would
be
glad
to
help
him
but
as
the
days
and
weeks
passed
with
no
prospect
of
aid
he
was
persuaded
not
only
to
unpack
his
belongings
but
also
to
have
his
wife
and
two
children
brought
to
live
with
him
the
two
children
fanny
and
called
tip
so
young
when
they
were
brought
to
the
marshalsea
that
they
soon
forgot
any
earlier
life
and
played
very
happily
with
other
children
in
the
prison
yard
not
long
after
a
little
sister
was
added
to
their
family
she
was
christened
amy
but
was
so
tiny
that
everybody
called
her
little
dorrit
being
born
in
the
prison
little
dorrit
was
petted
and
made
much
of
every
one
there
seemed
to
claim
her
and
visitors
were
proudly
shown
the
child
of
the
marshalsea
the
turnkey
who
was
a
man
took
an
especial
interest
in
her
by
rights
he
remarked
when
she
was
first
shown
to
him
i
ought
to
be
her
godfather
dorrit
looked
at
the
honest
fellow
for
a
moment
and
thought
that
he
would
suit
better
than
some
of
their
false
friends
perhaps
you
object
to
really
being
her
godfather
he
said
oh
i
object
if
you
replied
the
turnkey
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
she
was
christened
one
sunday
afternoon
when
the
turnkey
being
relieved
went
up
to
the
font
of
saint
church
and
promised
and
vowed
on
her
behalf
as
he
himself
related
when
he
came
back
like
a
good
this
invested
the
turnkey
with
a
new
proprietary
share
in
the
child
over
and
above
his
former
official
one
when
she
began
to
walk
and
talk
he
became
fond
of
her
bought
a
little
and
stood
it
by
the
high
fender
of
the
lodge
fireplace
liked
to
have
her
company
when
he
was
on
the
lock
and
used
to
bribe
her
with
cheap
toys
to
come
and
talk
to
him
the
child
for
her
part
soon
grew
so
fond
of
the
turnkey
that
she
would
come
climbing
up
the
lodge
steps
of
her
own
accord
at
all
hours
of
the
day
when
she
fell
asleep
in
the
little
by
the
high
fender
the
turnkey
would
cover
her
with
his
pocket
handkerchief
and
when
she
sat
in
it
dressing
and
undressing
a
soon
came
to
be
unlike
dolls
on
the
other
side
of
the
would
contemplate
her
from
the
top
of
his
stool
with
exceeding
gentleness
witnessing
these
things
the
inmates
would
express
an
opinion
that
the
turnkey
who
was
a
bachelor
had
been
cut
out
by
nature
for
a
family
man
but
the
turnkey
thanked
them
and
said
no
on
the
whole
it
was
enough
for
him
to
see
other
children
there
at
what
period
of
her
early
life
the
little
creature
began
to
perceive
that
it
was
not
the
habit
of
all
the
world
to
live
locked
up
in
narrow
yards
surrounded
by
high
walls
with
spikes
at
the
top
would
be
a
difficult
question
to
settle
but
she
was
a
very
very
little
creature
indeed
when
she
had
somehow
gained
the
knowledge
that
her
clasp
of
her
hand
was
to
be
always
loosened
at
the
door
which
the
great
key
opened
and
that
while
her
own
light
steps
were
free
to
pass
beyond
it
his
feet
must
never
cross
that
line
a
pitiful
and
plaintive
look
with
which
she
had
begun
to
regard
him
when
she
was
still
extremely
young
was
perhaps
a
part
of
this
discovery
wistful
and
wondering
she
would
sit
in
summer
weather
by
the
high
fender
in
the
lodge
looking
up
at
the
sky
through
the
barred
window
until
bars
of
light
would
arise
when
she
would
turn
her
eyes
away
thinking
of
the
fields
the
turnkey
said
once
after
watching
her
you
where
are
they
she
inquired
why
there
my
dear
said
the
turnkey
with
a
vague
flourish
of
his
key
just
about
there
does
anybody
open
them
and
shut
them
are
they
locked
the
turnkey
was
at
a
loss
well
he
said
not
in
general
are
they
very
pretty
bob
she
called
him
bob
by
his
own
particular
request
and
instruction
lovely
full
of
flowers
buttercups
and
daisies
and
turnkey
hesitated
being
short
of
dandelions
and
all
manner
of
games
is
it
very
pleasant
to
be
there
bob
prime
said
the
turnkey
was
father
ever
there
hem
coughed
the
turnkey
oh
yes
he
was
there
sometimes
is
he
sorry
not
to
be
there
now
particular
said
the
turnkey
nor
any
of
the
people
she
asked
glancing
at
the
listless
crowd
within
oh
are
you
quite
sure
and
certain
bob
at
this
difficult
point
of
the
conversation
bob
gave
in
and
changed
the
subject
always
his
last
resource
when
he
found
his
little
friend
getting
him
into
a
political
social
or
theological
corner
but
this
was
the
origin
of
a
series
of
sunday
excursions
that
these
two
curious
companions
made
together
they
used
to
issue
from
the
lodge
on
alternate
sunday
afternoons
with
great
gravity
bound
for
some
meadows
or
green
lanes
that
had
been
elaborately
appointed
by
the
turnkey
in
the
course
of
the
week
and
there
she
picked
grass
and
flowers
to
bring
home
while
he
smoked
his
pipe
afterwards
they
would
come
back
hand
in
hand
unless
she
was
more
than
usually
tired
and
had
fallen
asleep
on
his
shoulder
in
those
early
days
the
turnkey
first
began
profoundly
to
consider
a
question
which
cost
him
so
much
mental
labor
that
it
remained
undetermined
on
the
day
of
his
death
he
decided
to
will
and
bequeath
his
little
property
of
savings
to
his
godchild
and
the
point
arose
how
could
it
be
so
tied
up
that
she
alone
should
benefit
by
it
he
asked
the
knotty
question
of
every
lawyer
who
came
through
the
lodge
gate
on
business
settle
it
strictly
on
herself
the
gentleman
would
answer
but
look
here
quoth
the
turnkey
supposing
she
had
say
a
brother
say
a
father
say
a
husband
who
would
be
likely
to
make
a
grab
at
that
property
when
she
came
into
about
that
it
would
be
settled
on
herself
and
they
would
have
no
more
legal
claim
on
it
than
you
would
be
the
professional
answer
stop
a
bit
said
the
turnkey
supposing
she
was
and
they
came
over
her
your
law
for
tying
it
up
then
the
deepest
character
whom
the
turnkey
sounded
was
unable
to
produce
his
law
for
tying
such
a
knot
as
that
so
the
turnkey
thought
about
it
all
his
life
and
died
without
a
will
after
all
but
that
was
long
afterwards
when
his
was
past
sixteen
she
was
only
eight
when
her
mother
died
and
from
that
time
the
protection
that
her
wondering
eyes
had
expressed
towards
her
father
became
embodied
in
action
and
the
child
of
the
marshalsea
took
upon
herself
a
new
relation
at
first
such
a
baby
could
do
little
more
than
sit
with
him
deserting
her
livelier
place
by
the
high
fender
and
quietly
watching
him
but
this
made
her
so
far
necessary
to
him
that
he
became
accustomed
to
her
and
began
to
be
sensible
of
missing
her
when
she
was
not
there
through
this
little
gate
she
passed
out
of
childhood
into
the
world
what
her
pitiful
look
saw
at
that
early
time
in
her
father
in
her
sister
in
her
brother
in
the
jail
how
much
or
how
little
of
the
wretched
truth
it
pleased
god
to
make
visible
to
her
lies
hidden
with
many
mysteries
it
is
enough
that
she
was
inspired
to
be
something
which
was
not
what
the
rest
were
and
for
the
sake
of
the
rest
and
while
the
mark
of
the
prison
was
seen
only
too
clearly
in
her
vain
selfish
sister
and
weak
wayward
brother
little
life
was
singularly
free
from
taint
her
heart
was
full
of
service
and
love
and
so
in
spite
of
her
small
stature
and
want
of
strength
she
toiled
and
planned
and
soon
became
the
real
head
of
this
poor
fallen
house
at
thirteen
she
could
read
and
keep
is
could
put
down
in
words
and
figures
how
much
the
bare
necessaries
that
they
wanted
would
cost
and
how
much
less
they
had
to
buy
them
with
she
had
been
by
snatches
of
a
few
weeks
at
a
time
to
an
evening
school
outside
and
got
her
sister
and
brother
sent
to
day
schools
during
three
or
four
years
there
was
no
instruction
for
any
of
them
at
home
but
she
knew
one
her
father
could
no
longer
help
them
to
these
scanty
means
of
improvement
she
added
another
of
her
own
contriving
once
among
the
curious
crowd
of
inmates
there
appeared
a
her
sister
fanny
had
a
great
desire
to
learn
to
dance
and
seemed
to
have
a
taste
that
way
at
thirteen
years
old
the
child
of
the
marshalsea
presented
herself
to
the
with
a
little
bag
in
her
hand
and
said
timidly
if
you
please
i
was
born
here
sir
oh
you
are
the
young
lady
are
you
said
the
man
surveying
the
small
figure
and
uplifted
face
yes
sir
and
what
can
i
do
for
you
nothing
for
me
sir
thank
you
anxiously
undrawing
the
strings
of
the
little
bag
but
if
while
you
stay
here
you
could
be
so
kind
as
to
teach
my
sister
my
child
teach
her
for
nothing
said
the
shutting
up
the
bag
he
was
as
a
master
as
ever
danced
to
the
insolvent
court
and
he
kept
his
word
fanny
was
so
apt
a
pupil
and
made
such
wonderful
progress
that
he
continued
to
teach
her
after
he
was
released
from
prison
in
time
he
obtained
a
place
for
her
at
a
small
theatre
it
was
at
the
same
theatre
where
her
was
also
now
a
poor
a
clarinet
for
a
living
and
fanny
left
the
marshalsea
and
went
to
live
with
him
the
success
of
this
beginning
gave
little
dorrit
courage
to
try
again
this
time
on
her
own
behalf
she
had
long
wanted
to
learn
how
to
sew
and
watched
and
waited
for
a
seamstress
to
come
to
the
prison
at
last
one
came
and
little
dorrit
went
to
call
upon
her
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
looking
timidly
round
the
door
of
the
milliner
whom
she
found
in
tears
and
in
bed
but
i
was
born
here
everybody
seemed
to
hear
of
her
as
soon
as
they
arrived
for
the
milliner
sat
up
in
bed
drying
her
eyes
and
said
just
as
the
had
said
oh
are
the
child
are
you
yes
i
am
sorry
i
got
anything
for
you
said
the
milliner
shaking
her
head
not
that
if
you
please
i
want
to
learn
needlework
why
should
you
do
that
returned
the
milliner
with
me
before
you
it
has
not
done
me
much
good
it
to
have
done
anybody
much
good
who
comes
here
she
returned
in
all
simplicity
but
i
want
to
learn
just
the
same
i
am
afraid
you
are
so
weak
you
see
the
milliner
objected
i
think
i
am
weak
and
you
are
so
very
very
little
you
see
continued
the
milliner
yes
i
am
afraid
i
am
very
little
indeed
returned
the
child
of
the
marshalsea
and
so
began
to
sob
over
that
unfortunate
defect
of
hers
which
came
so
often
in
her
way
the
was
not
morose
or
only
newly
touched
took
her
in
hand
with
found
her
the
most
patient
and
earnest
of
pupils
and
made
her
a
cunning
workwoman
in
course
of
time
and
so
presently
little
dorrit
had
the
immense
satisfaction
of
going
out
to
work
by
the
day
and
of
supplying
her
father
with
many
little
comforts
which
otherwise
he
would
not
have
enjoyed
but
her
hardest
task
was
in
getting
her
brother
out
of
prison
and
into
some
useful
employment
the
life
there
had
been
anything
but
good
for
him
and
at
eighteen
he
was
idle
and
shiftless
not
caring
to
lift
a
finger
for
himself
in
her
dilemma
little
dorrit
went
to
her
old
friend
the
turnkey
dear
bob
said
she
what
is
to
become
of
poor
tip
the
turnkey
scratched
his
head
privately
he
had
a
poor
opinion
of
the
young
man
well
my
dear
he
answered
something
ought
to
be
done
with
him
suppose
i
try
to
get
him
into
the
law
that
would
be
so
good
of
you
bob
the
turnkey
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
by
dint
of
buttonholing
every
lawyer
who
came
through
the
gate
on
business
he
found
tip
a
place
as
clerk
where
the
pay
was
not
large
but
the
prospects
good
tip
idled
away
in
the
law
office
for
six
months
then
came
back
to
the
prison
one
evening
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
told
his
sister
he
was
not
going
back
again
not
going
back
she
exclaimed
i
am
so
tired
of
it
said
tip
that
i
have
cut
it
tip
tired
of
everything
with
intervals
of
marshalsea
lounging
his
small
second
mother
aided
by
her
trusty
friend
got
him
into
a
variety
of
situations
but
whatever
tip
went
into
he
came
out
of
tired
announcing
that
he
had
cut
it
nevertheless
the
brave
little
creature
did
so
fix
her
heart
on
her
rescue
that
while
he
was
ringing
out
these
doleful
changes
she
pinched
and
scraped
enough
together
to
ship
him
for
canada
when
he
was
tired
of
nothing
to
do
and
disposed
in
its
turn
to
cut
even
that
he
graciously
consented
to
go
to
canada
and
there
was
grief
in
her
bosom
over
parting
with
him
and
joy
in
the
hope
of
his
being
put
in
a
straight
course
at
last
god
bless
you
dear
tip
be
too
proud
to
come
and
see
us
when
you
have
made
your
fortune
all
right
said
tip
and
went
but
not
all
the
way
to
canada
in
fact
not
farther
than
liverpool
after
making
the
voyage
to
that
port
from
london
he
found
himself
so
strongly
impelled
to
cut
the
vessel
that
he
resolved
to
walk
back
again
carrying
out
which
intention
he
presented
himself
before
her
at
the
expiration
of
a
month
in
rags
without
shoes
and
much
more
tired
than
ever
at
length
he
found
a
situation
for
himself
and
disappeared
for
months
she
never
heard
from
him
but
once
in
that
time
though
it
was
as
well
for
her
peace
of
mind
that
she
did
not
he
was
making
trades
for
a
tricky
horse
dealer
one
evening
she
was
alone
at
up
at
the
window
to
save
the
twilight
lingering
above
the
he
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
she
kissed
and
welcomed
him
but
was
afraid
to
ask
him
any
question
he
saw
how
anxious
and
timid
she
was
and
appeared
sorry
i
am
afraid
amy
be
vexed
this
time
upon
my
life
i
am
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so
tip
have
you
come
back
but
not
the
worst
of
it
not
the
worst
of
it
look
so
startled
amy
come
back
in
a
new
way
one
of
the
prisoners
now
i
owe
forty
pounds
for
the
first
time
in
all
those
years
she
sank
under
her
cares
she
cried
with
her
clasped
hands
lifted
above
her
head
that
it
would
kill
their
father
if
he
ever
knew
it
and
fell
down
at
graceless
feet
it
was
easier
for
tip
to
bring
her
to
her
senses
than
for
her
to
bring
to
understand
what
a
pitiable
thing
he
had
done
but
he
agreed
to
help
keep
it
a
secret
from
their
father
and
little
dorrit
toiled
harder
than
ever
in
the
hope
of
one
day
getting
him
out
again
thus
passed
the
life
of
the
child
of
the
marshalsea
until
she
became
a
young
woman
how
the
prison
gates
were
among
the
ladies
for
whom
little
dorrit
sewed
by
the
day
was
a
clennam
a
cold
stern
person
who
lived
in
a
cold
stern
house
yet
she
gave
the
child
plenty
of
work
and
paid
her
fairly
well
so
little
dorrit
was
often
to
be
found
in
some
gloomy
corner
there
sewing
away
busily
and
adding
nothing
at
all
to
the
few
sounds
of
the
quiet
old
rooms
clennam
lived
alone
except
for
a
servant
or
two
and
she
herself
had
lost
the
use
of
her
limbs
so
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
house
was
gloomy
and
that
son
arthur
found
it
so
when
he
returned
from
a
long
visit
in
india
arthur
clennam
was
a
young
man
who
had
ideas
of
his
own
and
who
had
disappointed
his
mother
by
refusing
to
continue
his
business
they
were
not
in
made
the
house
seem
all
the
colder
but
he
was
kind
and
impulsive
though
timid
little
dorrit
kept
as
much
in
the
dark
corners
as
possible
arthur
soon
noticed
her
and
asked
one
of
the
old
servants
who
she
was
he
could
learn
nothing
except
that
she
was
a
seamstress
who
came
by
the
day
to
sew
and
who
went
away
every
night
no
one
knew
where
the
child
interested
him
and
he
resolved
to
follow
her
one
evening
and
learn
where
she
lived
he
did
so
and
was
amazed
to
see
her
enter
the
gate
of
a
large
forbidding
building
did
not
know
what
building
as
he
had
been
long
abroad
just
then
he
saw
an
old
man
in
a
threadbare
coat
once
blue
come
tottering
along
carrying
a
clarinet
in
a
limp
case
as
this
old
man
was
about
to
enter
the
same
gate
arthur
stopped
him
with
a
question
pray
sir
said
he
what
is
this
place
ay
this
place
returned
the
old
man
staying
a
pinch
of
snuff
on
its
road
and
pointing
at
the
place
without
looking
at
it
this
is
the
marshalsea
sir
the
prison
sir
said
the
old
man
with
the
air
of
deeming
it
not
quite
necessary
to
insist
upon
that
name
the
prison
he
turned
himself
about
and
went
on
i
beg
your
pardon
said
arthur
stopping
him
once
more
but
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
another
question
can
any
one
go
in
here
any
one
can
replied
the
old
man
but
it
is
not
every
one
who
can
go
out
pardon
me
once
more
are
you
familiar
with
the
place
sir
returned
the
old
man
squeezing
his
little
packet
of
snuff
in
his
hand
and
turning
upon
his
interrogator
as
if
such
questions
hurt
him
i
am
i
beg
you
to
excuse
me
i
am
not
impertinently
curious
but
have
a
good
object
do
you
know
the
name
of
dorrit
here
my
name
sir
replied
the
old
man
most
unexpectedly
is
dorrit
arthur
pulled
off
his
hat
to
him
grant
me
the
favor
of
half
a
dozen
words
i
have
recently
come
home
to
england
after
a
long
absence
i
have
seen
at
my
clennam
in
the
young
woman
working
at
her
needle
whom
i
have
only
heard
addressed
or
spoken
of
as
little
dorrit
i
have
felt
sincerely
interested
in
her
and
have
had
a
great
desire
to
know
something
more
about
her
i
saw
her
not
a
minute
before
you
came
up
pass
in
at
that
door
the
old
man
looked
at
him
attentively
are
you
in
earnest
sir
i
do
assure
you
that
i
am
i
know
very
little
of
the
world
sir
returned
the
other
who
had
a
weak
and
quavering
voice
i
am
merely
passing
on
like
the
shadow
over
the
it
would
be
worth
no
while
to
mislead
me
it
would
really
be
too
poor
a
success
to
yield
any
satisfaction
the
young
woman
whom
you
saw
go
in
here
is
my
child
my
brother
is
william
dorrit
i
am
frederick
you
say
you
have
seen
her
at
your
i
know
your
mother
befriends
her
you
have
felt
an
interest
in
her
and
you
wish
to
know
what
she
does
here
come
and
see
he
went
on
again
and
arthur
accompanied
him
my
brother
said
the
old
man
pausing
on
the
step
and
slowly
facing
round
again
has
been
here
many
years
and
much
that
happens
even
among
ourselves
out
of
doors
is
kept
from
him
for
reasons
that
i
enter
upon
now
be
so
good
as
to
say
nothing
of
my
working
at
her
needle
if
you
keep
within
our
bounds
you
can
not
well
be
wrong
now
come
and
see
arthur
followed
him
down
a
narrow
entry
at
the
end
of
which
a
key
was
turned
and
a
strong
door
was
opened
from
within
it
admitted
them
into
a
lodge
or
lobby
across
which
they
passed
and
so
through
another
door
and
a
grating
into
the
prison
the
old
man
always
plodding
on
before
turned
round
in
his
slow
stiff
stooping
manner
when
they
came
to
the
turnkey
on
duty
as
if
to
present
his
companion
the
turnkey
nodded
and
the
companion
passed
in
without
being
asked
whom
he
wanted
the
night
was
dark
and
the
prison
lamps
in
the
yard
and
the
candles
in
the
prison
windows
faintly
shining
behind
many
sorts
of
wry
old
curtain
and
blind
had
not
the
air
of
making
it
lighter
a
few
people
loitered
about
but
the
greater
part
of
the
population
was
within
doors
the
old
man
taking
the
side
of
the
yard
turned
in
at
the
third
or
fourth
doorway
and
began
to
ascend
the
stairs
they
are
rather
dark
sir
but
you
will
not
find
anything
in
the
way
he
said
he
paused
for
a
moment
before
opening
the
door
on
the
second
story
he
had
no
sooner
turned
the
handle
than
the
visitor
saw
little
dorrit
and
understood
the
reason
of
her
dining
alone
as
she
always
preferred
to
do
she
had
brought
the
meat
home
that
she
should
have
eaten
herself
and
was
already
warming
it
on
a
gridiron
over
the
fire
for
her
father
who
clad
in
an
old
gray
gown
and
a
black
cap
was
awaiting
his
supper
at
the
table
a
clean
cloth
was
spread
before
him
with
knife
fork
and
spoon
glass
and
pewter
such
zests
as
his
cayenne
pepper
and
pickles
in
a
saucer
were
not
wanting
she
started
colored
deeply
and
turned
white
the
visitor
more
with
his
eyes
than
by
the
slight
impulsive
motion
of
his
hand
entreated
her
to
be
reassured
and
to
trust
him
i
found
this
gentleman
said
the
clennam
william
son
of
the
outer
gate
wishful
as
he
was
going
by
of
paying
his
respects
but
hesitating
whether
to
come
in
or
not
this
is
my
brother
william
sir
i
hope
said
arthur
very
doubtful
what
to
say
that
my
respect
for
your
daughter
may
explain
and
justify
my
desire
to
be
presented
to
you
sir
clennam
returned
the
other
rising
taking
his
cap
off
in
the
flat
of
his
hand
and
so
holding
it
ready
to
put
on
again
you
do
me
honor
you
are
welcome
sir
with
a
low
bow
frederick
a
chair
pray
sit
down
mr
clennam
he
put
his
black
cap
on
again
as
he
had
taken
it
off
and
resumed
his
own
seat
there
was
a
wonderful
air
of
benignity
and
patronage
in
his
manner
these
were
the
ceremonies
with
which
he
received
all
visitors
you
are
welcome
to
the
marshalsea
sir
i
have
welcomed
many
gentlemen
to
these
walls
perhaps
you
are
daughter
amy
may
have
i
am
the
father
of
this
place
i
have
understood
said
arthur
dashing
at
the
assertion
you
know
i
dare
say
that
my
daughter
amy
was
born
here
a
good
girl
sir
a
dear
girl
and
long
a
comfort
and
support
to
me
amy
my
dear
put
the
dish
on
clennam
will
excuse
the
primitive
customs
to
which
we
are
reduced
here
is
it
a
compliment
to
ask
you
if
you
would
do
me
the
honor
sir
thank
you
returned
arthur
i
have
dined
she
filled
her
glass
put
all
the
little
matters
on
the
table
ready
to
his
hand
and
then
sat
beside
him
while
he
ate
his
supper
she
put
some
bread
before
herself
and
touched
his
glass
with
her
lips
but
arthur
saw
she
was
troubled
and
took
nothing
her
look
at
her
father
half
admiring
him
and
proud
of
him
for
him
all
devoted
and
loving
went
to
his
inmost
heart
the
father
of
the
marshalsea
condescended
towards
his
brother
as
an
amiable
man
a
private
character
who
had
not
arrived
at
distinction
frederick
said
he
you
and
fanny
sup
at
your
lodgings
i
know
what
have
you
done
with
fanny
frederick
she
is
walking
with
tip
you
may
my
son
clennam
he
has
been
a
little
wild
and
difficult
to
settle
but
his
introduction
to
the
world
was
rather
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
faint
sigh
and
looked
round
the
a
little
adverse
your
first
visit
here
sir
my
first
you
could
hardly
have
been
here
since
your
boyhood
without
my
knowledge
it
very
seldom
happens
that
any
here
without
being
presented
to
me
as
many
as
forty
or
fifty
in
a
day
have
been
introduced
to
my
brother
said
frederick
faintly
lighting
up
with
a
ray
of
pride
yes
the
father
of
the
marshalsea
assented
we
have
even
exceeded
that
number
on
a
fine
sunday
in
term
time
it
is
quite
a
reception
thus
the
old
man
prattled
on
proud
of
his
queer
distinction
and
yet
showing
traces
of
the
fine
gentleman
he
once
was
and
while
he
listened
arthur
felt
his
heart
throb
with
sympathy
for
the
brave
girl
sitting
silent
across
the
table
who
had
so
long
borne
the
burdens
of
this
ruined
family
upon
her
frail
shoulders
he
could
not
say
anything
to
her
here
but
when
he
rose
to
take
his
leave
he
asked
her
by
a
look
to
come
with
him
to
the
gate
he
felt
he
must
make
some
explanation
for
thus
intruding
and
learning
her
secret
pray
forgive
me
he
said
when
they
paused
alone
at
the
gate
i
followed
you
from
my
i
should
not
have
done
so
but
believe
me
it
was
only
in
the
hope
of
doing
you
some
service
what
i
have
seen
here
in
this
short
time
has
increased
my
heartfelt
wish
to
be
a
friend
to
you
she
seemed
to
take
courage
while
he
spoke
to
her
you
are
very
good
sir
you
speak
very
earnestly
to
me
but
i
wish
you
had
not
watched
me
he
understood
the
emotion
with
which
she
said
it
to
arise
in
her
behalf
and
he
respected
it
and
was
silent
clennam
has
been
of
great
service
to
me
i
know
what
we
should
have
done
without
the
employment
she
has
given
me
i
am
afraid
it
may
not
be
a
good
return
to
become
secret
with
her
i
can
say
no
more
sir
i
am
sure
you
mean
to
be
kind
to
us
thank
you
thank
you
she
was
so
agitated
and
he
was
so
moved
by
compassion
for
her
and
by
deep
interest
in
her
story
as
it
dawned
upon
him
that
he
could
scarcely
tear
himself
away
but
the
stoppage
of
the
bell
and
the
quiet
in
the
prison
were
a
warning
to
depart
and
with
a
few
hurried
words
of
kindness
he
left
her
gliding
back
to
her
father
the
next
day
arthur
missed
little
dorrit
at
his
home
and
wondered
if
she
might
be
ill
the
weather
was
stormy
but
she
was
not
usually
hindered
by
that
so
he
walked
out
toward
the
prison
to
look
for
her
and
was
presently
rewarded
by
seeing
her
hurrying
along
in
the
face
of
the
gale
she
had
just
reached
the
iron
bridge
some
distance
from
the
gates
when
his
voice
caused
her
to
stop
short
the
wind
blew
roughly
the
wet
squalls
came
rattling
past
them
skimming
the
pools
on
the
road
and
pavement
and
raining
them
down
into
the
river
the
clouds
raced
on
furiously
in
the
sky
the
smoke
and
mist
raced
after
them
the
dark
tide
ran
fierce
and
strong
in
the
same
direction
little
dorrit
seemed
the
least
the
quietest
and
weakest
of
creatures
let
me
put
you
in
a
coach
said
arthur
clennam
very
nearly
adding
my
poor
child
she
hurriedly
declined
thanking
him
and
saying
that
wet
or
dry
made
little
difference
to
her
she
was
used
to
go
about
in
all
weathers
he
knew
it
to
be
so
and
was
touched
with
more
pity
thinking
of
the
slight
figure
at
his
side
making
its
nightly
way
through
the
damp
dark
boisterous
streets
to
such
a
place
of
rest
but
i
am
glad
to
have
seen
you
sir
she
added
shyly
i
did
not
want
you
to
think
that
we
were
ungrateful
for
your
interest
and
kindness
last
night
and
besides
i
had
something
else
to
she
paused
as
if
unable
to
go
on
to
say
to
he
prompted
that
i
hope
you
will
not
misunderstand
my
father
judge
him
sir
as
you
would
judge
others
outside
the
gates
he
has
been
there
so
long
i
never
saw
him
outside
but
i
can
understand
that
he
must
have
grown
different
in
some
things
since
my
thoughts
will
never
be
unjust
or
harsh
towards
him
believe
me
not
she
said
with
a
prouder
air
as
the
misgiving
evidently
crept
upon
her
that
she
might
seem
to
be
abandoning
him
not
that
he
has
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
for
himself
or
that
i
have
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
for
him
he
only
requires
to
be
understood
i
only
ask
for
him
that
his
life
may
be
fairly
remembered
all
that
he
said
was
quite
true
he
is
very
much
respected
everybody
who
comes
in
is
glad
to
know
him
he
is
more
courted
than
any
one
else
he
is
far
more
thought
of
than
the
marshal
is
if
ever
pride
were
innocent
it
was
innocent
in
little
dorrit
when
she
grew
boastful
of
her
father
it
is
often
said
that
his
manners
are
a
true
and
quite
a
study
he
is
not
to
be
blamed
for
being
in
need
poor
love
who
could
be
in
prison
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
be
prosperous
what
affection
in
her
words
what
compassion
in
her
repressed
tears
what
a
great
soul
of
fidelity
within
her
how
true
the
light
that
shed
false
brightness
round
him
if
i
have
found
it
best
to
conceal
where
my
home
is
it
is
not
because
i
am
ashamed
of
him
god
forbid
nor
am
i
so
much
ashamed
of
the
place
itself
as
might
be
supposed
people
are
not
bad
because
they
come
there
i
have
known
many
good
friends
there
and
have
spent
many
happy
hours
she
had
relieved
the
faithful
fulness
of
her
heart
and
modestly
said
raising
her
eyes
appealingly
to
her
new
i
did
not
mean
to
say
so
much
nor
have
i
ever
but
once
spoken
about
this
before
but
it
seems
to
set
it
more
right
than
it
was
last
night
i
said
i
wished
you
had
not
followed
me
sir
i
wish
it
so
much
now
unless
you
should
i
wish
it
at
all
unless
i
should
have
spoken
so
confusedly
you
can
scarcely
understand
me
which
i
am
afraid
may
be
the
case
he
told
her
with
perfect
truth
that
it
was
not
the
case
and
putting
himself
between
her
and
the
sharp
wind
and
rain
sheltered
her
as
well
as
he
could
i
feel
permitted
now
he
said
to
ask
you
a
little
more
concerning
your
father
has
he
many
creditors
oh
a
great
number
i
mean
detaining
creditors
who
keep
him
where
he
is
oh
yes
a
great
number
can
you
tell
can
get
the
information
no
doubt
elsewhere
if
you
can
not
is
the
most
influential
of
them
little
dorrit
was
not
sure
of
any
names
but
she
had
heard
her
father
mention
several
people
with
whom
he
said
he
once
had
dealings
she
told
him
these
names
and
clennam
made
a
careful
note
of
them
it
can
do
no
harm
he
thought
to
see
some
of
these
people
the
thought
did
not
come
so
quietly
but
that
she
quickly
guessed
it
ah
said
little
dorrit
shaking
her
head
with
the
mild
despair
of
a
lifetime
many
people
used
to
think
once
of
getting
my
poor
father
out
but
you
know
how
hopeless
it
is
she
forgot
to
be
shy
at
the
moment
in
honestly
warning
him
away
from
the
sunken
wreck
he
had
a
dream
of
raising
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
which
assuredly
in
association
with
her
patient
face
her
fragile
figure
her
spare
dress
and
the
wind
and
rain
did
not
turn
him
from
his
purpose
of
helping
her
but
presently
an
incident
happened
which
showed
him
a
new
side
to
her
of
helpfulness
and
service
they
were
come
into
the
high
street
where
the
prison
stood
when
a
voice
cried
little
mother
little
mother
little
dorrit
stopped
looking
back
when
an
excited
figure
of
a
strange
kind
bounced
against
them
fell
down
and
scattered
the
contents
of
a
large
basket
filled
with
potatoes
in
the
mud
oh
maggy
said
little
dorrit
what
a
clumsy
child
you
are
maggy
was
not
hurt
but
picked
herself
up
immediately
and
began
to
pick
up
the
potatoes
in
which
both
the
others
helped
maggy
picked
up
very
few
potatoes
and
a
great
quantity
of
mud
she
was
a
curious
overgrown
creature
of
about
with
a
vacant
smiling
face
and
a
tattered
shawl
she
seemed
twice
as
large
as
the
child
to
whom
she
evidently
looked
for
protection
and
called
little
mother
arthur
clennam
looked
with
the
expression
of
one
saying
may
i
ask
who
this
is
little
dorrit
whose
hand
maggy
had
begun
to
fondle
answered
in
words
they
were
under
a
gateway
into
which
the
majority
of
the
potatoes
had
rolled
this
is
maggy
sir
maggy
sir
echoed
the
personage
presented
little
mother
she
is
the
granddaughter
echoed
maggy
of
my
old
nurse
who
has
been
dead
a
long
time
maggy
how
old
are
you
ten
mother
said
maggy
you
think
how
good
she
is
sir
said
little
dorrit
with
infinite
tenderness
good
is
echoed
maggy
transferring
the
pronoun
in
a
most
expressive
way
from
herself
to
her
little
mother
or
how
clever
said
little
dorrit
she
goes
on
errands
as
well
as
any
one
maggy
laughed
and
is
as
trustworthy
as
the
bank
of
england
maggy
laughed
she
earns
her
own
living
entirely
entirely
sir
in
a
lower
and
triumphant
tone
really
does
what
is
her
history
asked
clennam
think
of
that
maggy
said
little
dorrit
taking
two
large
hands
and
clapping
them
together
a
gentleman
from
thousands
of
miles
away
wanting
to
know
your
history
history
cried
maggy
little
mother
she
means
me
said
little
dorrit
rather
confused
she
is
very
much
attached
to
me
her
old
grandmother
was
not
so
kind
to
her
as
she
should
have
been
was
she
maggy
when
maggy
was
ten
years
old
she
continued
she
had
a
bad
fever
sir
and
has
never
grown
any
older
since
ten
years
old
said
maggy
nodding
her
head
but
what
a
nice
hospital
so
comfortable
it
oh
so
nice
it
was
such
a
place
she
had
never
been
at
peace
before
sir
continued
the
young
girl
turning
towards
arthur
for
an
instant
and
speaking
low
and
she
always
runs
off
upon
that
such
beds
there
is
there
cried
maggy
such
lemonades
such
oranges
such
broth
and
wine
such
chicking
oh
it
a
delightful
place
to
go
and
stop
at
so
maggy
stopped
there
as
long
as
she
could
said
little
dorrit
in
her
former
tone
of
telling
a
story
the
tone
designed
for
ear
and
at
last
when
she
could
stop
there
no
longer
she
came
out
then
because
she
was
never
to
be
more
than
ten
years
old
however
long
she
however
long
she
lived
echoed
maggy
and
because
she
was
very
was
so
weak
that
when
she
began
to
laugh
she
stop
was
a
great
maggy
grew
mighty
grave
of
a
sudden
her
grandmother
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
her
and
for
some
years
was
very
unkind
to
her
indeed
at
length
in
course
of
time
maggy
began
to
take
pains
to
improve
herself
and
to
be
very
attentive
and
very
industrious
and
by
degrees
was
allowed
to
come
in
and
out
as
often
as
she
liked
and
got
enough
to
do
to
support
herself
and
does
support
herself
and
that
said
little
dorrit
clapping
the
two
great
hands
together
again
is
history
as
maggy
knows
ah
that
was
all
the
history
as
little
dorrit
told
it
but
arthur
reading
between
the
lines
saw
in
absolute
love
and
devotion
the
weeks
and
months
of
toil
and
care
on
the
part
of
a
pitying
faithful
child
whose
own
burden
seemed
great
enough
without
carrying
others
the
dirty
gateway
with
the
wind
and
rain
whistling
through
it
and
the
basket
of
muddy
potatoes
waiting
to
be
spilt
again
or
taken
up
never
seemed
the
common
hole
it
really
was
when
he
looked
back
to
it
by
these
lights
never
never
thereafter
arthur
clennam
who
was
a
man
of
some
means
devoted
a
great
part
of
his
time
to
tracing
out
the
dorrit
records
he
went
from
one
government
office
to
long
weary
round
of
he
could
get
any
light
on
the
matter
he
employed
an
agent
whose
specialty
was
to
search
out
lost
estates
and
at
last
after
several
months
their
combined
efforts
were
rewarded
dorrit
was
found
to
be
to
a
large
estate
that
had
long
lain
unknown
unclaimed
and
growing
greater
his
right
to
it
was
cleared
up
by
this
skilful
agent
so
that
all
dorrit
had
to
do
now
would
be
to
discharge
his
debts
and
he
would
be
a
free
man
when
arthur
was
convinced
of
this
surprising
fortune
he
hastened
first
to
little
dorrit
whom
he
wished
to
see
alone
but
before
he
could
say
a
word
his
face
told
her
that
something
unusual
was
afoot
hastily
dropping
her
sewing
she
cried
clennam
the
matter
nothing
nothing
that
bad
i
have
come
to
tell
you
good
news
good
fortune
wonderful
fortune
her
lips
seemed
to
repeat
the
words
but
no
sound
came
dear
little
dorrit
he
said
your
the
ice
of
the
pale
face
broke
at
the
word
and
little
lights
of
expression
passed
all
over
it
they
were
all
expressions
of
pain
her
breath
was
faint
and
hurried
her
heart
beat
fast
but
he
saw
that
the
eyes
appealed
to
him
to
go
on
your
father
can
be
free
within
this
week
he
does
not
know
it
we
must
go
to
him
from
here
to
tell
him
of
it
your
father
will
be
free
within
a
few
days
remember
we
must
go
to
him
from
here
to
tell
him
of
it
that
brought
her
back
her
eyes
were
closing
but
they
opened
again
this
is
not
all
the
good
fortune
this
is
not
all
the
wonderful
good
fortune
little
dorrit
shall
i
tell
you
more
her
lips
shaped
yes
he
will
be
a
rich
man
a
great
sum
of
money
is
waiting
to
be
paid
over
to
him
as
his
inheritance
you
are
all
henceforth
very
wealthy
bravest
and
best
of
children
i
thank
heaven
that
you
are
rewarded
she
turned
her
head
towards
his
shoulder
and
raised
her
arm
towards
his
neck
then
cried
out
father
father
father
and
swooned
away
the
housekeeper
came
running
in
at
this
and
little
dorrit
was
soon
revived
smiling
bravely
at
her
own
weakness
but
the
news
had
been
too
much
for
her
it
was
the
dream
of
her
true
come
she
exclaimed
we
must
not
lose
a
moment
but
must
hasten
to
my
father
when
the
turnkey
who
was
on
duty
admitted
them
into
the
lodge
he
saw
something
in
their
faces
which
filled
him
with
astonishment
he
stood
looking
after
them
when
they
hurried
into
the
prison
as
though
he
perceived
that
they
had
come
back
accompanied
by
a
ghost
apiece
two
or
three
debtors
whom
they
passed
looked
after
them
too
and
presently
joining
the
turnkey
formed
a
little
group
on
the
lodge
steps
in
the
midst
of
which
there
originated
a
whisper
that
the
father
was
going
to
get
his
discharge
within
a
few
minutes
it
was
heard
in
the
remotest
room
in
the
prison
little
dorrit
opened
the
door
from
without
and
they
both
entered
her
father
was
sitting
in
his
old
gray
gown
and
his
old
black
cap
in
the
sunlight
by
the
window
reading
his
newspaper
his
glasses
were
in
his
hand
and
he
had
just
looked
round
surprised
at
first
no
doubt
by
her
step
upon
the
stairs
not
expecting
her
until
night
surprised
again
by
seeing
arthur
clennam
in
her
company
as
they
came
in
the
same
unwonted
look
in
both
of
them
which
had
already
caught
attention
in
the
yard
below
struck
him
he
did
not
rise
or
speak
but
laid
down
his
glasses
and
his
newspaper
on
the
table
beside
him
and
looked
at
them
with
his
mouth
a
little
open
and
his
lips
trembling
when
arthur
put
out
his
hand
he
touched
it
but
not
with
his
usual
state
and
then
he
turned
to
his
daughter
who
had
sat
down
close
beside
him
with
her
hands
upon
his
shoulder
and
looked
attentively
in
her
face
father
i
have
been
made
so
happy
this
morning
you
have
been
made
so
happy
my
dear
by
clennam
father
he
brought
me
such
joyful
and
wonderful
intelligence
about
you
her
agitation
was
great
and
the
tears
rolled
down
her
face
he
put
his
hand
suddenly
to
his
heart
and
looked
at
clennam
compose
yourself
sir
said
clennam
and
take
a
little
time
to
think
to
think
of
the
brightest
and
most
fortunate
accidents
of
life
we
have
all
heard
of
great
surprises
of
joy
they
are
not
at
an
end
clennam
not
at
an
end
not
at
an
end
he
touched
himself
upon
the
breast
instead
of
saying
me
no
returned
clennam
he
looked
at
clennam
and
so
looking
at
him
seemed
to
change
into
a
very
old
haggard
man
the
sun
was
bright
upon
the
wall
beyond
the
window
and
on
the
spikes
at
the
top
he
slowly
stretched
out
the
hand
that
had
been
upon
his
heart
and
pointed
at
the
wall
it
is
down
said
clennam
gone
he
remained
in
the
same
attitude
looking
steadfastly
at
him
and
in
its
place
said
clennam
slowly
and
distinctly
are
the
means
to
possess
and
enjoy
the
utmost
that
they
have
so
long
shut
out
dorrit
there
is
not
the
smallest
doubt
that
within
a
few
days
you
will
be
free
and
highly
prosperous
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
soul
on
this
change
of
fortune
and
on
the
happy
future
into
which
you
are
soon
to
carry
the
treasure
you
have
been
blessed
with
best
of
all
the
riches
you
can
have
treasure
in
the
dear
child
at
your
side
with
those
words
he
pressed
hand
and
released
it
and
his
daughter
laying
her
face
against
his
encircled
him
in
the
hour
of
his
prosperity
with
her
arms
as
she
had
in
the
long
years
of
his
adversity
encircled
him
with
her
love
and
toil
and
truth
and
poured
out
her
full
heart
in
gratitude
hope
joy
blissful
ecstasy
and
all
for
him
i
shall
see
him
as
i
never
saw
him
yet
i
shall
see
my
dear
father
with
the
dark
cloud
cleared
away
i
shall
see
him
as
my
poor
mother
saw
him
long
ago
oh
my
dear
my
dear
oh
father
father
oh
thank
god
thank
god
dorrit
came
slowly
out
of
the
daze
into
which
he
had
seemed
to
fall
to
divert
his
mind
arthur
told
him
how
the
good
fortune
had
been
found
through
the
skill
of
an
agent
he
shall
be
rewarded
he
exclaimed
starting
up
every
one
shall
rewarded
every
cent
i
owe
shall
be
paid
oh
can
this
be
true
a
freeman
and
all
my
debts
paid
give
me
my
purse
amy
he
clutched
it
as
if
it
were
already
overflowing
with
gold
and
paced
rapidly
up
and
down
the
room
just
then
a
great
cheering
arose
in
the
prison
yard
the
news
has
spread
already
said
clennam
looking
down
from
the
window
will
you
show
yourself
to
them
dorrit
they
are
very
earnest
and
evidently
wish
it
confess
i
could
have
desired
amy
my
dear
he
said
jogging
about
in
a
more
feverish
flutter
than
before
to
have
made
some
change
in
my
dress
first
and
to
have
bought
watch
and
chain
but
if
it
must
be
done
as
it
is
must
be
done
fasten
the
collar
of
my
shirt
my
dear
clennam
would
you
oblige
a
blue
neckcloth
you
will
find
in
that
drawer
at
your
elbow
button
my
coat
across
at
the
chest
my
love
it
looks
broader
buttoned
with
his
trembling
hand
he
pushed
his
gray
hair
up
and
then
taking
clennam
and
his
daughter
for
supporters
appeared
at
the
window
leaning
on
an
arm
of
each
the
inmates
cheered
him
very
heartily
and
he
kissed
his
hand
to
them
with
great
urbanity
and
protection
when
he
withdrew
into
the
room
again
he
said
poor
creatures
in
a
tone
of
much
pity
for
their
miserable
condition
presently
he
said
unexpectedly
clennam
i
beg
your
pardon
am
i
to
understand
my
dear
sir
that
i
pass
through
the
lodge
at
this
moment
a
walk
i
think
not
dorrit
was
the
unwilling
reply
there
are
certain
forms
to
be
completed
and
although
your
detention
here
is
now
in
itself
a
form
i
fear
it
has
to
be
observed
for
a
few
hours
longer
a
few
hours
sir
he
returned
in
a
sudden
passion
you
talk
very
easily
of
hours
sir
how
long
do
you
suppose
sir
that
an
hour
is
to
a
man
who
is
choking
for
want
of
air
it
was
the
cry
of
a
man
who
had
been
imprisoned
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
little
dorrit
had
been
thinking
too
after
softly
putting
his
gray
hair
aside
and
touching
his
forehead
with
her
lips
she
looked
towards
arthur
who
came
nearer
to
her
and
pursued
in
a
low
whisper
the
subject
of
her
thoughts
clennam
will
he
pay
all
his
debts
before
he
leaves
here
no
doubt
all
all
the
debts
for
which
he
has
been
imprisoned
here
all
my
life
and
longer
no
doubt
there
was
something
of
uncertainty
and
remonstrance
in
her
look
something
that
was
not
all
satisfaction
he
wondered
to
detect
it
and
said
are
you
not
glad
it
seems
to
me
hard
said
little
dorrit
that
he
should
have
lost
so
many
years
and
suffered
so
much
and
at
last
pay
all
the
debts
as
well
it
seems
to
me
hard
that
he
should
pay
in
life
and
money
both
my
dear
clennam
was
beginning
yes
i
know
i
am
wrong
she
pleaded
timidly
think
any
worse
of
me
it
has
grown
up
with
me
here
the
prison
which
could
spoil
so
many
things
had
tainted
little
mind
no
more
than
this
it
was
the
first
speck
clennam
had
ever
seen
it
was
the
last
speck
clennam
ever
saw
of
the
prison
atmosphere
upon
her
he
thought
this
and
forebore
to
say
another
word
with
the
thought
her
purity
and
goodness
came
before
him
in
their
brightest
light
the
little
spot
made
them
the
more
beautiful
personal
history
of
david
my
earliest
the
first
things
that
i
seem
to
remember
are
the
figure
of
my
mother
with
her
pretty
hair
and
youthful
face
and
peggotty
our
faithful
servant
large
of
figure
black
of
eye
and
with
cheeks
and
arms
so
hard
and
red
that
i
wondered
the
birds
peck
them
in
preference
to
apples
i
believe
i
can
remember
these
two
at
a
little
distance
apart
dwarfed
to
my
sight
by
stooping
down
or
kneeling
on
the
floor
and
i
going
unsteadily
from
the
one
to
the
other
my
father
i
never
saw
for
he
died
before
i
was
born
what
else
do
i
remember
let
me
see
there
comes
to
me
a
vision
of
our
quaint
cosy
little
home
the
rookery
on
the
ground
floor
is
kitchen
opening
into
a
back
yard
with
a
on
a
pole
in
the
centre
without
any
pigeons
in
it
a
great
in
a
corner
without
any
dog
and
a
quantity
of
fowls
that
look
terribly
tall
to
me
walking
about
in
a
ferocious
manner
there
is
one
cock
who
gets
upon
a
post
to
crow
and
seems
to
take
particular
notice
of
me
as
i
look
at
him
through
the
kitchen
window
who
makes
me
shiver
he
is
so
fierce
of
the
geese
outside
the
gate
who
come
waddling
after
me
with
their
long
necks
stretched
out
when
i
go
that
way
i
dream
fearfully
at
night
here
is
a
long
passage
leading
from
kitchen
to
the
front
door
a
dark
storeroom
opens
out
of
it
and
that
is
a
place
to
be
run
past
at
night
for
i
know
what
may
be
among
those
tubs
and
jars
and
old
in
which
there
is
the
smell
of
soap
pickles
pepper
candles
and
coffee
all
at
one
whiff
then
there
are
the
two
parlors
the
parlor
in
which
we
sit
of
an
evening
my
mother
and
i
and
peggotty
is
quite
our
companion
when
her
work
is
done
and
we
are
the
best
parlor
where
we
sit
on
a
sunday
grandly
but
not
so
comfortably
and
now
i
see
the
outside
of
our
house
with
the
latticed
bedroom
windows
standing
open
to
let
in
the
air
and
the
ragged
old
still
dangling
in
the
elm
trees
at
the
bottom
of
the
front
garden
now
i
am
in
the
garden
at
the
back
beyond
the
yard
where
the
empty
and
very
preserve
of
butterflies
as
i
remember
it
with
a
high
fence
and
a
gate
and
padlock
where
the
fruit
clusters
on
the
trees
riper
and
richer
than
fruit
has
ever
been
since
in
any
other
garden
and
where
my
mother
gathers
some
in
a
basket
while
i
stand
by
bolting
gooseberries
slyly
and
trying
to
look
unmoved
a
great
wind
rises
and
the
summer
is
gone
in
a
moment
we
are
playing
in
the
winter
twilight
dancing
about
the
parlor
when
my
mother
is
out
of
breath
and
rests
herself
in
an
i
watch
her
winding
her
bright
curls
round
her
fingers
and
straightening
her
waist
and
nobody
knows
better
than
i
do
that
she
likes
to
look
so
well
and
is
proud
of
being
so
pretty
that
is
among
my
very
earliest
impressions
and
a
sense
that
we
were
both
a
little
afraid
of
peggotty
and
submit
ourselves
in
most
things
to
her
direction
peggotty
and
i
were
sitting
one
night
by
the
parlor
fire
alone
i
had
been
reading
to
peggotty
about
crocodiles
i
must
not
have
read
very
clearly
for
i
remember
she
had
a
cloudy
impression
that
they
were
a
sort
of
vegetable
i
was
tired
of
reading
and
sleepy
but
having
leave
as
a
high
treat
to
sit
up
until
my
mother
came
home
from
spending
the
evening
at
a
i
would
rather
have
died
upon
my
post
than
have
gone
to
bed
we
had
exhausted
the
crocodiles
and
begun
with
alligators
when
the
bell
rang
we
went
out
to
the
door
and
there
was
my
mother
looking
unusually
pretty
i
thought
and
with
her
a
gentleman
with
beautiful
black
hair
and
whiskers
who
had
walked
home
with
us
from
church
last
sunday
as
my
mother
stooped
down
on
the
threshold
to
take
me
in
her
arms
and
kiss
me
the
gentleman
said
i
was
a
more
highly
privileged
little
fellow
than
a
something
like
that
what
does
that
mean
i
asked
him
over
her
shoulder
he
patted
me
on
the
head
but
somehow
i
like
him
or
his
deep
voice
and
i
was
jealous
that
his
hand
should
touch
my
in
touching
it
did
i
put
it
away
as
well
as
i
could
my
mother
gently
chid
me
for
being
rude
and
keeping
me
close
to
her
shawl
turned
to
thank
the
gentleman
for
bringing
her
home
from
the
moment
that
i
first
saw
the
gentleman
with
the
black
whiskers
i
held
a
deep
instinctive
dislike
to
him
and
i
am
sure
peggotty
agreed
with
me
from
some
remarks
i
chanced
to
hear
her
utter
to
my
mother
but
was
his
coming
often
to
the
rookery
and
exerted
himself
always
to
be
agreeable
to
me
calling
me
a
fine
boy
and
patting
me
on
the
head
so
i
tried
to
think
myself
very
ungrateful
but
still
i
could
not
make
myself
like
him
the
sight
of
him
made
me
fear
that
something
was
going
to
know
what
not
long
after
that
when
peggotty
and
i
were
sitting
alone
she
darning
and
i
reading
farther
in
the
crocodile
book
my
mother
was
out
as
she
often
was
with
murdstone
bit
off
a
thread
and
asked
master
davy
how
should
you
like
to
go
along
with
me
and
spend
a
fortnight
at
my
at
yarmouth
that
be
a
treat
is
your
brother
an
agreeable
man
peggotty
i
inquired
doubtfully
oh
what
an
agreeable
man
he
is
cried
peggotty
holding
up
her
hands
then
the
sea
and
the
boats
and
ships
and
the
fishermen
and
the
beach
and
to
play
peggotty
meant
her
nephew
ham
but
she
spoke
of
him
as
a
morsel
of
english
grammar
i
was
flushed
by
her
summary
of
delights
and
replied
that
it
would
indeed
be
a
treat
but
what
would
my
mother
say
why
then
as
good
as
bet
a
guinea
said
peggotty
intent
upon
my
face
that
let
us
go
ask
her
if
you
like
as
soon
as
ever
she
comes
home
there
now
but
she
to
do
while
away
said
i
putting
my
small
elbows
on
the
table
to
argue
the
point
she
live
by
herself
if
peggotty
were
looking
for
a
hole
all
of
a
sudden
in
the
heel
of
that
stocking
it
must
have
been
a
very
little
one
indeed
and
not
worth
darning
i
say
peggotty
she
live
by
herself
you
know
oh
bless
you
said
peggotty
looking
at
me
again
at
last
you
know
going
to
stay
for
a
fortnight
with
grayper
going
to
have
a
lot
of
company
oh
if
that
was
it
i
was
quite
ready
to
go
i
waited
in
the
utmost
impatience
until
my
mother
came
home
from
for
it
was
that
identical
neighbor
to
ascertain
if
we
could
get
leave
to
carry
out
this
great
idea
without
being
nearly
so
much
surprised
as
i
had
expected
my
mother
entered
into
it
readily
and
it
was
all
arranged
that
night
and
my
board
and
lodging
during
the
visit
were
to
be
paid
for
the
day
soon
came
for
our
going
it
was
such
an
early
day
that
it
came
soon
even
to
me
who
was
in
a
fever
of
expectation
and
half
afraid
that
an
earthquake
or
a
fiery
mountain
or
some
other
accident
might
stop
the
expedition
we
were
to
go
in
a
cart
which
departed
in
the
morning
after
breakfast
i
would
have
given
any
money
to
have
been
allowed
to
wrap
myself
up
and
sleep
in
my
hat
and
boots
it
touches
me
nearly
now
although
i
tell
it
lightly
to
recollect
how
eager
i
was
to
leave
my
happy
home
to
think
how
little
i
suspected
what
i
did
leave
for
ever
i
am
glad
to
recollect
that
when
the
carrier
began
to
move
my
mother
ran
out
at
the
gate
and
called
to
him
to
stop
that
she
might
kiss
me
once
more
i
am
glad
to
dwell
upon
the
earnestness
and
love
with
which
she
lifted
up
her
face
to
mine
as
we
left
her
standing
in
the
road
murdstone
came
up
to
where
she
was
and
chided
her
for
being
so
moved
i
was
looking
back
round
the
awning
of
the
cart
and
wondered
what
business
it
was
of
his
peggotty
who
was
also
looking
back
on
the
other
side
seemed
anything
but
satisfied
as
the
face
she
brought
back
into
the
cart
denoted
the
horse
was
the
laziest
horse
in
the
world
i
thought
as
he
shuffled
along
with
his
head
down
but
peggotty
had
brought
along
a
basket
of
refreshments
which
would
have
lasted
us
handsomely
for
a
journey
three
times
as
long
and
at
last
we
drove
up
to
the
yarmouth
tavern
where
we
found
ham
awaiting
us
he
was
a
huge
strong
fellow
about
six
feet
high
with
a
simple
face
he
put
me
upon
his
shoulder
and
my
box
under
his
arm
and
trudged
away
easily
down
a
lane
littered
with
odds
and
ends
past
forges
yards
and
gas
works
till
we
came
out
upon
an
open
waste
of
sand
with
the
sea
pounding
upon
it
and
eating
away
at
it
then
ham
said
our
house
davy
i
looked
in
all
directions
as
far
as
i
could
and
away
at
the
sea
but
no
house
could
make
out
there
was
a
black
barge
or
some
other
kind
of
boat
not
far
off
high
and
dry
on
the
ground
with
an
iron
funnel
sticking
out
of
it
for
a
chimney
and
smoking
very
cosily
but
nothing
else
in
the
way
of
a
house
that
was
visible
to
me
not
it
said
i
that
thing
it
davy
returned
ham
if
it
had
been
palace
egg
and
all
i
suppose
i
could
not
have
been
more
charmed
with
the
idea
of
living
in
it
there
was
a
delightful
door
cut
in
the
side
and
it
was
roofed
in
and
there
were
little
windows
in
it
but
the
charm
of
it
was
that
it
was
a
which
had
no
doubt
been
upon
the
water
hundreds
of
times
and
which
had
never
been
intended
to
be
lived
in
on
dry
land
it
was
beautifully
clean
inside
and
as
tidy
as
possible
there
was
a
table
and
a
dutch
clock
and
a
chest
of
drawers
and
a
with
a
painting
on
it
the
tray
was
kept
from
tumbling
down
by
a
bible
and
the
tray
if
it
had
tumbled
down
would
have
smashed
a
quantity
of
cups
and
saucers
and
a
around
the
book
on
the
walls
there
were
some
colored
pictures
framed
and
glazed
of
scripture
subjects
there
were
some
hooks
in
the
beams
of
the
ceiling
whose
use
i
did
not
know
and
some
lockers
and
boxes
scattered
around
which
served
for
seats
one
thing
i
particularly
noticed
in
this
delightful
house
was
the
smell
of
fish
which
was
so
searching
that
when
i
took
out
my
to
wipe
my
nose
i
found
it
smelt
exactly
as
if
it
had
wrapped
up
a
lobster
on
my
whispering
this
to
peggotty
she
informed
me
that
her
brother
dealt
in
lobsters
crabs
and
crawfish
and
i
afterwards
found
that
a
heap
of
these
creatures
in
a
state
of
wonderful
confusion
with
one
another
and
never
leaving
off
pinching
whatever
they
laid
hold
of
were
usually
to
be
found
in
a
little
wooden
where
the
pots
and
kettles
were
kept
we
were
welcomed
by
a
very
civil
woman
in
a
white
apron
whom
i
had
seen
courtesying
at
the
door
when
i
was
on
back
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
likewise
by
a
most
beautiful
little
girl
with
a
necklace
of
blue
beads
who
let
me
kiss
her
when
i
offered
to
but
ran
away
and
hid
herself
by
and
by
when
we
had
dined
in
a
sumptuous
manner
off
boiled
fish
melted
butter
and
potatoes
with
a
chop
for
me
a
hairy
man
with
a
very
face
came
home
as
he
called
peggotty
lass
and
gave
her
a
hearty
smack
on
the
cheek
i
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
her
brother
and
so
he
turned
presently
introduced
to
me
as
peggotty
the
master
of
the
house
glad
to
see
you
sir
said
peggotty
find
us
rough
sir
but
find
us
ready
i
thanked
him
and
replied
that
i
was
sure
i
should
be
happy
in
such
a
delightful
place
the
civil
woman
with
the
white
apron
was
gummidge
an
old
widowed
lady
who
kept
the
in
fine
order
the
little
girl
was
emily
a
niece
of
she
had
never
seen
her
father
just
as
i
had
never
seen
was
our
first
bond
of
sympathy
she
had
lost
her
mother
too
and
as
we
played
together
happily
in
the
sand
i
told
her
all
about
my
mother
and
how
we
had
only
each
other
and
i
was
going
to
grow
up
right
away
to
take
care
of
her
of
course
i
was
quite
in
love
with
little
emily
i
am
sure
i
loved
her
quite
as
truly
as
one
could
possibly
love
and
i
made
her
confess
that
she
loved
me
so
when
the
golden
days
flew
by
and
the
time
of
parting
drew
near
our
agony
of
mind
was
intense
the
farewells
were
very
tearful
and
if
ever
in
my
life
i
had
a
void
in
my
heart
i
had
one
that
day
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
that
the
delightful
fortnight
by
the
sea
had
driven
out
all
thoughts
of
home
but
no
sooner
were
we
on
the
return
journey
than
the
home
longing
came
crowding
in
upon
me
tenfold
i
grew
so
excited
to
see
my
mother
that
it
seemed
as
if
i
wait
for
that
blundering
old
cart
but
peggotty
instead
of
sharing
in
these
transports
tried
to
check
them
though
very
kindly
and
looked
confused
and
out
of
sorts
the
rookery
would
come
however
in
spite
of
her
when
the
horse
did
how
well
i
recollect
it
on
a
cold
gray
afternoon
with
a
dull
sky
threatening
rain
the
door
opened
and
i
sprang
in
half
laughing
and
half
crying
as
i
looked
for
my
mother
it
was
not
she
who
met
me
but
a
strange
servant
why
peggotty
i
said
ruefully
she
come
home
yes
yes
master
davy
said
peggotty
come
home
wait
a
bit
master
davy
and
tell
you
something
peggotty
said
i
quite
frightened
the
matter
the
matter
bless
you
master
davy
dear
she
answered
with
an
air
of
cheerfulness
the
matter
sure
mamma
master
davy
said
peggotty
untying
her
bonnet
with
a
shaking
hand
and
speaking
in
a
breathless
sort
of
way
what
do
you
think
you
have
got
a
pa
i
trembled
and
turned
white
know
what
or
with
my
grave
in
the
churchyard
and
the
raising
of
the
dead
seemed
to
strike
me
like
an
unwholesome
wind
a
new
one
said
peggotty
a
new
one
i
repeated
peggotty
gave
a
gasp
as
if
she
were
swallowing
something
that
was
very
hard
and
putting
out
her
hand
said
come
and
see
him
i
want
to
see
him
and
your
mamma
said
peggotty
i
ceased
to
draw
back
and
we
went
straight
to
the
best
parlor
where
she
left
me
on
one
side
of
the
fire
sat
my
mother
on
the
other
murdstone
my
mother
dropped
her
work
and
arose
hurriedly
but
timidly
i
thought
now
clara
my
dear
said
murdstone
recollect
control
yourself
davy
boy
how
do
you
do
i
gave
him
my
hand
then
i
went
and
kissed
my
mother
she
kissed
me
patted
me
gently
on
the
shoulder
and
sat
down
again
to
her
work
i
could
not
look
at
her
i
could
not
look
at
him
i
knew
quite
well
that
he
was
looking
at
us
both
and
i
turned
to
the
window
and
looked
out
there
at
some
shrubs
that
were
drooping
their
heads
in
the
cold
as
soon
as
i
could
i
crept
upstairs
my
old
dear
bedroom
was
changed
and
i
was
to
lie
a
long
way
off
i
rambled
downstairs
to
find
anything
that
was
like
itself
so
altered
it
all
seemed
and
roamed
into
the
yard
i
very
soon
started
back
from
there
for
the
empty
was
filled
up
with
a
great
and
like
he
was
very
angry
at
the
sight
of
me
and
sprang
out
to
get
at
me
i
fall
into
that
first
lonely
evening
when
i
crept
off
alone
feeling
that
no
one
wanted
me
was
the
most
miserable
of
my
life
i
rolled
up
in
a
corner
of
my
bed
and
cried
myself
to
sleep
presently
i
was
awakened
by
somebody
saying
here
he
is
and
uncovering
my
hot
head
my
mother
and
peggotty
had
come
to
look
for
me
and
it
was
one
of
them
who
had
done
it
davy
said
my
mother
the
matter
i
thought
it
very
strange
that
she
should
ask
me
and
answered
nothing
i
turned
over
on
my
face
i
recollect
to
hide
my
trembling
lip
which
answered
her
with
greater
truth
davy
said
my
mother
davy
my
child
i
dare
say
no
words
she
could
have
uttered
would
have
affected
me
so
much
then
as
her
calling
me
her
child
i
hid
my
tears
in
the
bedclothes
and
pressed
her
from
me
with
my
hand
when
she
would
have
raised
me
up
then
i
felt
the
touch
of
a
hand
that
i
knew
was
neither
hers
nor
and
slipped
to
my
feet
at
the
bedside
it
was
hand
and
he
kept
it
on
my
arm
as
he
said
this
clara
my
love
have
you
forgotten
firmness
my
dear
i
am
very
sorry
edward
said
my
mother
i
meant
to
be
very
good
go
below
my
dear
he
answered
david
and
i
will
come
down
together
when
we
two
were
left
alone
he
shut
the
door
and
sitting
on
a
chair
and
holding
me
standing
before
him
looked
steadily
into
my
eyes
david
he
said
making
his
lips
thin
by
pressing
them
together
if
i
have
an
obstinate
horse
or
dog
to
deal
with
what
do
you
think
i
do
i
know
i
beat
him
i
make
him
wince
and
smart
i
say
to
myself
conquer
that
and
if
it
were
to
cost
him
all
the
blood
he
had
i
should
do
it
what
is
that
upon
your
face
dirt
i
said
he
knew
it
was
the
mark
of
tears
as
well
as
i
but
if
he
had
asked
the
question
twenty
times
each
time
with
twenty
blows
i
believe
my
baby
heart
would
have
burst
before
i
would
have
told
him
so
you
have
a
good
deal
of
intelligence
for
a
little
fellow
he
said
with
a
grave
smile
that
belonged
to
him
and
you
understood
me
very
well
i
see
wash
that
face
sir
and
come
down
with
me
clara
my
dear
he
said
when
i
had
done
his
bidding
and
he
walked
me
into
the
parlor
with
his
hand
still
on
my
arm
you
will
not
be
made
uncomfortable
any
more
i
hope
we
shall
soon
improve
our
youthful
humors
what
a
little
thing
will
change
the
current
of
our
lives
i
might
have
been
made
another
creature
perhaps
by
a
kind
word
just
then
a
word
of
welcome
home
of
assurance
that
it
home
might
have
made
me
respect
my
new
father
instead
of
hate
him
but
the
word
was
not
spoken
and
the
time
for
it
was
gone
from
that
time
my
life
was
a
lonely
one
my
mother
petted
me
in
secret
but
plainly
stood
in
awe
of
murdstone
and
even
the
dauntless
peggotty
must
needs
keep
her
peace
his
word
alone
was
law
after
a
time
his
sister
miss
murdstone
came
to
live
with
us
and
from
the
second
day
of
her
arrival
she
took
charge
of
the
household
keys
and
managed
things
with
a
firmness
second
only
to
her
brother
himself
there
had
been
some
talk
of
my
going
to
and
miss
murdstone
had
originated
it
and
my
mother
had
of
course
agreed
with
them
nothing
however
was
concluded
on
the
subject
yet
and
in
the
meantime
i
learned
my
lessons
at
home
shall
i
ever
forget
those
lessons
they
were
presided
over
nominally
by
my
mother
but
really
by
murdstone
and
his
sister
who
were
always
present
and
found
them
a
favorable
occasion
for
giving
my
mother
lessons
in
that
miscalled
firmness
which
was
the
bane
of
both
our
lives
i
believe
i
was
kept
at
home
for
that
purpose
i
had
been
apt
enough
to
learn
and
willing
enough
when
my
mother
and
i
had
lived
alone
together
i
can
faintly
remember
learning
the
alphabet
at
her
knee
to
this
day
when
i
look
upon
the
fat
black
letters
in
the
primer
the
puzzling
novelty
of
their
shapes
and
the
easy
of
o
and
q
and
s
seem
to
present
themselves
again
before
me
as
they
used
to
do
but
they
recall
no
feeling
of
disgust
or
reluctance
on
the
contrary
i
seem
to
have
walked
along
a
path
of
flowers
as
far
as
the
and
to
have
been
cheered
by
the
gentleness
of
my
voice
and
manner
all
the
way
but
these
solemn
lessons
which
succeeded
i
remember
as
the
to
my
peace
and
a
grievous
daily
drudgery
and
misery
they
were
very
long
very
numerous
very
hard
i
was
generally
as
much
bewildered
by
them
as
i
believe
my
poor
mother
was
herself
let
me
remember
how
it
used
to
be
and
bring
one
morning
back
again
i
come
into
the
parlor
after
breakfast
with
my
books
and
an
and
a
slate
my
mother
is
ready
for
me
at
her
but
not
half
so
ready
as
murdstone
in
his
by
the
window
though
he
pretends
to
be
reading
a
book
or
as
miss
murdstone
sitting
near
my
mother
stringing
steel
beads
the
very
sight
of
these
two
has
such
an
influence
over
me
that
i
begin
to
feel
the
words
i
have
been
at
infinite
pains
to
get
into
my
head
all
sliding
away
and
going
i
know
where
i
wonder
where
they
do
go
by
the
bye
i
hand
the
first
book
to
my
mother
perhaps
it
is
a
grammar
perhaps
a
history
or
geography
i
take
a
last
drowning
look
at
the
page
as
i
give
it
into
her
hand
and
start
off
aloud
at
a
racing
pace
while
i
have
got
it
fresh
i
trip
over
a
word
murdstone
looks
up
i
trip
over
another
word
miss
murdstone
looks
up
i
redden
tumble
over
words
and
stop
i
think
my
mother
would
show
me
the
book
if
she
dared
but
she
does
not
dare
and
she
says
softly
oh
davy
davy
now
clara
says
murdstone
be
firm
with
the
boy
say
davy
davy
childish
he
knows
his
lesson
or
he
does
not
know
it
he
does
know
it
miss
murdstone
interposes
awfully
i
am
really
afraid
he
does
not
says
my
mother
then
you
see
clara
returns
miss
murdstone
you
should
just
give
him
the
book
back
and
make
him
know
it
yes
certainly
says
my
mother
that
is
what
i
intend
to
do
my
dear
jane
now
davy
try
once
more
and
be
stupid
the
natural
result
of
this
treatment
was
to
make
me
sullen
dull
and
dogged
and
my
temper
was
not
improved
by
the
sense
that
i
was
daily
shut
out
from
my
mother
one
morning
after
about
six
months
of
these
lessons
when
i
went
into
the
parlor
with
my
books
i
found
my
mother
looking
anxious
miss
murdstone
looking
firm
and
murdstone
binding
something
round
the
bottom
of
a
cane
lithe
and
limber
cane
which
he
left
off
binding
when
i
came
in
and
poised
and
switched
in
the
air
now
david
he
said
you
must
be
far
more
careful
than
usual
he
gave
the
cane
another
poise
and
another
switch
and
laid
it
down
beside
him
with
an
expressive
look
and
took
up
his
book
this
was
a
good
freshener
to
my
presence
of
mind
as
a
beginning
i
felt
the
words
of
my
lessons
slipping
off
not
one
by
one
or
line
by
line
but
by
the
entire
page
i
tried
to
lay
hold
of
them
but
they
seemed
if
i
may
so
express
it
to
have
put
skates
on
and
to
skim
away
from
me
with
a
smoothness
there
was
no
checking
we
began
badly
and
went
on
worse
i
had
come
in
with
an
idea
that
i
was
very
well
prepared
but
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
a
mistake
book
after
book
was
added
to
the
heap
of
failures
miss
murdstone
being
firmly
watchful
of
us
all
the
time
and
when
we
came
to
the
last
my
mother
burst
out
crying
clara
said
miss
murdstone
in
her
warning
voice
murdstone
laid
down
his
book
and
stood
up
cane
in
hand
david
you
and
i
will
go
upstairs
he
said
he
walked
me
up
to
my
room
slowly
and
gravely
and
when
we
got
there
suddenly
twisted
my
head
under
his
arm
murdstone
sir
i
cried
to
him
pray
beat
me
i
have
tried
to
learn
sir
but
i
learn
while
you
and
miss
murdstone
are
by
i
indeed
you
indeed
david
he
said
try
that
he
had
my
head
as
in
a
vice
but
i
twined
round
him
somehow
and
stopped
him
for
a
moment
entreating
him
not
to
beat
me
it
was
only
for
a
moment
that
i
stopped
him
for
he
cut
me
heavily
an
instant
afterwards
and
in
the
same
instant
i
caught
his
hand
in
my
mouth
and
bit
it
through
it
sets
my
teeth
on
edge
to
think
of
it
he
beat
me
then
as
if
he
would
have
beaten
me
to
death
above
all
the
noise
we
made
i
heard
them
running
up
the
stairs
and
crying
heard
my
mother
crying
peggotty
then
he
was
gone
and
the
door
was
locked
outside
and
i
was
lying
torn
and
sore
and
raging
upon
the
floor
how
well
i
recollect
when
i
became
quiet
what
an
unnatural
stillness
seemed
to
reign
through
the
whole
house
how
well
i
remember
when
my
smart
and
passion
began
to
cool
how
wicked
i
began
to
feel
i
sat
listening
for
a
long
while
but
there
was
not
a
sound
i
crawled
up
from
the
floor
and
saw
my
face
in
the
glass
so
swollen
red
and
ugly
that
it
almost
frightened
me
my
stripes
were
sore
and
stiff
and
made
me
cry
afresh
when
i
moved
but
they
were
nothing
to
the
guilt
i
felt
it
lay
like
lead
upon
my
breast
for
five
days
i
was
imprisoned
thus
within
my
room
seeing
no
one
except
miss
murdstone
who
came
to
bring
me
food
they
live
like
years
in
my
remembrance
on
the
fifth
night
i
heard
my
name
softly
whispered
through
the
keyhole
i
groped
my
way
to
the
door
and
putting
my
own
lips
to
the
keyhole
whispered
is
that
you
peggotty
dear
yes
my
own
precious
davy
she
replied
be
as
soft
as
a
mouse
or
the
hear
us
i
understood
this
to
mean
miss
murdstone
her
room
being
close
by
mamma
dear
peggotty
is
she
very
angry
with
me
i
could
hear
peggotty
crying
softly
on
her
side
of
the
keyhole
as
i
was
doing
on
mine
before
she
answered
no
not
very
what
is
going
to
be
done
with
me
peggotty
dear
do
you
know
school
near
london
when
peggotty
i
see
mamma
yes
said
peggotty
morning
then
she
stole
away
fearful
of
surprises
in
the
morning
miss
murdstone
appeared
as
usual
and
told
me
i
was
going
to
school
which
was
not
altogether
such
news
to
me
as
she
supposed
she
also
informed
me
that
when
i
was
dressed
i
was
to
come
down
stairs
into
the
parlor
and
have
my
breakfast
there
i
found
my
mother
very
pale
and
with
red
eyes
into
whose
arms
i
ran
and
begged
her
pardon
from
my
suffering
soul
oh
davy
she
said
that
you
could
hurt
any
one
i
love
try
to
be
better
pray
to
be
better
i
forgive
you
but
i
am
so
grieved
davy
that
you
should
have
such
bad
passions
in
your
heart
they
had
persuaded
her
that
i
was
a
wicked
fellow
and
she
was
more
sorry
for
that
than
for
my
going
away
i
felt
it
sorely
i
tried
to
eat
my
parting
breakfast
but
my
tears
dropped
upon
my
bread
and
butter
and
trickled
into
my
tea
i
saw
my
mother
look
at
me
sometimes
and
then
glance
at
the
watchful
miss
murdstone
and
then
look
down
or
look
away
master
box
there
said
miss
murdstone
when
wheels
were
heard
at
the
gate
i
looked
for
peggotty
but
it
was
not
she
neither
she
nor
murdstone
appeared
my
former
acquaintance
the
carrier
was
at
the
door
the
box
was
taken
out
to
his
cart
and
lifted
in
clara
said
miss
murdstone
in
her
warning
note
yes
my
dear
jane
returned
my
mother
davy
you
are
going
for
your
own
good
my
child
you
will
come
home
in
the
holidays
and
be
a
better
boy
god
bless
you
miss
murdstone
was
good
enough
to
take
me
out
to
the
cart
and
to
say
on
the
way
that
she
hoped
i
would
repent
before
i
came
to
a
bad
end
and
then
i
got
into
the
cart
and
the
lazy
horse
walked
off
with
it
we
had
not
gone
half
a
mile
when
i
was
astonished
to
see
peggotty
burst
from
a
hedge
and
climb
into
the
cart
not
a
word
did
she
say
but
she
squeezed
me
tight
crammed
a
bag
of
cakes
into
my
pockets
and
put
a
purse
into
my
hand
after
a
final
squeeze
she
got
down
from
the
cart
and
ran
away
as
quickly
as
she
had
come
my
was
now
so
wet
that
the
carrier
proposed
spreading
it
out
upon
the
back
to
dry
we
did
so
and
i
then
had
leisure
to
look
at
the
purse
it
had
three
bright
shillings
in
it
from
peggotty
precious
folded
together
in
a
bit
of
paper
on
which
was
written
in
my
hand
for
davy
with
my
love
i
was
so
overcome
by
this
that
i
asked
the
carrier
to
reach
me
my
handkerchief
again
but
he
said
i
had
better
let
it
dry
first
i
thought
so
too
and
wiped
my
eyes
on
my
sleeve
this
time
then
the
cakes
came
in
for
consideration
i
offered
the
carrier
one
which
he
ate
at
a
gulp
without
the
slightest
change
of
expression
did
make
asked
the
carrier
whose
name
by
the
way
was
barkis
peggotty
you
mean
sir
ah
said
barkis
her
yes
she
makes
all
our
pastry
and
does
all
our
cooking
barkis
said
nothing
for
some
moments
perhaps
you
might
be
to
her
later
on
yes
indeed
i
said
then
you
just
say
to
her
that
barkis
is
would
you
yes
sir
i
replied
considerably
puzzled
by
the
message
and
i
did
deliver
it
the
very
first
time
i
wrote
to
peggotty
i
did
not
then
know
that
the
carrier
meant
by
being
willing
he
wanted
to
marry
my
good
peggotty
and
was
too
shy
to
say
so
for
himself
at
yarmouth
i
changed
to
the
coach
for
london
and
at
london
to
still
another
coach
for
salem
the
school
and
so
after
a
long
wearisome
journey
i
reached
my
new
destination
another
leaf
of
my
life
was
turned
over
and
a
fresh
one
begun
school
steerforth
and
salem
house
was
a
square
brick
building
with
wings
the
schoolroom
was
very
long
with
three
rows
of
desks
running
the
length
of
it
and
bristling
all
around
with
pegs
for
hats
and
slates
scraps
of
and
exercises
littered
the
floor
the
other
students
had
not
yet
returned
from
their
holidays
when
i
took
my
first
peep
into
this
room
in
company
with
mell
one
of
the
tutors
presently
i
chanced
to
see
a
pasteboard
sign
lying
upon
a
desk
and
bearing
these
words
take
care
of
him
he
bites
i
hurriedly
climbed
upon
the
desk
fearful
of
a
dog
underneath
but
saw
none
what
are
you
doing
there
asked
mell
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
replied
if
you
please
looking
for
the
dog
dog
what
dog
i
pointed
to
the
sign
no
copperfield
he
said
gravely
not
a
dog
a
boy
my
instructions
are
to
put
this
sign
on
your
back
sorry
to
do
so
but
must
do
it
with
that
he
took
me
down
and
tied
the
placard
which
was
neatly
constructed
for
the
purpose
on
my
shoulders
like
a
knapsack
and
wherever
i
went
afterwards
i
had
the
consolation
of
carrying
it
what
i
suffered
nobody
can
imagine
whether
it
was
possible
for
people
to
see
me
or
not
i
always
fancied
that
somebody
was
reading
it
it
was
no
relief
to
turn
round
and
find
nobody
for
wherever
my
back
was
there
i
imagined
somebody
always
to
be
until
at
last
i
positively
began
to
have
a
dread
of
myself
as
the
boy
who
bite
creakle
the
master
of
the
school
was
a
short
man
and
bald
on
the
top
of
his
head
he
had
a
little
nose
and
large
chin
he
had
lost
his
voice
and
spoke
almost
in
a
whisper
which
surprised
me
greatly
for
his
face
always
looked
angry
and
the
exertion
of
talking
made
his
thick
veins
stick
out
so
that
he
looked
angrier
still
when
the
boys
began
to
come
back
i
found
my
ordeal
on
account
of
the
sign
on
my
back
not
quite
so
great
as
i
had
feared
and
it
was
chiefly
on
account
of
the
first
fellow
to
arrive
tommy
traddles
dear
tommy
traddles
you
made
a
friend
of
a
poor
lonesome
frightened
boy
that
day
who
will
always
be
loyal
to
you
so
long
as
he
lives
traddles
was
a
jolly
looking
boy
who
laughed
heartily
when
he
first
saw
the
card
as
at
a
great
joke
and
he
saved
me
from
any
further
shyness
by
introducing
me
to
every
boy
and
saying
gaily
look
here
a
game
happily
too
most
of
the
boys
came
back
and
were
not
very
boisterous
at
my
expense
some
of
them
certainly
did
dance
about
me
like
wild
indians
and
could
not
resist
patting
me
lest
i
should
bite
and
saying
lie
down
sir
and
calling
me
towzer
but
on
the
whole
i
got
through
rather
easily
i
was
not
considered
as
being
formally
received
into
the
school
however
until
steerforth
arrived
before
this
boy
who
was
reputed
to
be
a
great
scholar
and
was
very
and
at
least
years
my
senior
i
was
carried
as
before
a
magistrate
he
inquired
under
a
shed
in
the
playground
into
the
particulars
of
my
punishment
and
was
pleased
to
express
his
opinion
that
it
was
a
jolly
shame
for
which
i
became
bound
to
him
ever
afterwards
then
steerforth
asked
how
much
money
i
had
and
when
i
told
him
he
suggested
that
it
was
the
proper
thing
for
a
new
boy
to
stand
treat
to
the
others
i
agreed
but
felt
helpless
whereupon
he
kindly
volunteered
to
get
the
things
for
me
and
smuggle
them
into
my
room
i
was
a
little
uneasy
about
spending
my
but
dare
say
so
i
handed
them
over
to
him
and
he
procured
the
feast
and
laid
it
out
on
my
bed
saying
there
you
are
young
copperfield
and
a
royal
spread
got
i
think
of
doing
the
honors
of
the
feast
at
my
time
of
life
while
he
was
by
my
hand
shook
at
the
very
thought
of
it
i
begged
him
to
do
me
the
favor
of
presiding
and
my
request
being
seconded
by
the
other
boys
he
acceded
to
it
and
sat
upon
my
pillow
handing
round
the
viands
with
perfect
fairness
i
must
say
as
to
me
i
sat
on
his
left
hand
and
the
rest
were
grouped
about
us
on
the
nearest
beds
and
on
the
floor
how
well
i
recollect
our
sitting
there
talking
in
whispers
or
their
talking
and
my
respectfully
listening
i
ought
rather
to
say
the
moonlight
falling
a
little
way
into
the
room
through
the
window
painting
a
pale
window
on
the
floor
and
the
greater
part
of
us
in
shadow
except
when
steerforth
struck
a
match
when
he
wanted
to
look
for
anything
on
the
board
and
shed
a
blue
glare
over
us
that
was
gone
directly
i
heard
all
kinds
of
things
about
the
school
i
heard
that
creakle
was
a
tartar
and
thrashed
the
boys
except
steerforth
upon
whom
he
dare
lay
his
hand
i
heard
that
creakle
was
very
ignorant
and
that
mell
who
was
not
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
was
poorly
paid
all
this
and
much
more
i
heard
in
the
whispers
of
that
moonlit
room
before
we
finally
betook
ourselves
to
bed
from
that
time
on
big
handsome
steerforth
took
me
under
his
protection
and
for
my
part
i
was
his
willing
slave
i
would
tell
him
tales
which
i
had
imbibed
from
my
early
reading
while
he
would
help
me
do
my
sums
and
keep
the
other
boys
from
tormenting
me
why
he
the
fine
should
have
taken
notice
of
me
at
all
i
know
but
i
remember
i
all
but
worshipped
him
with
his
easy
swagger
and
lordly
air
the
other
boy
to
whom
i
always
owed
allegiance
was
traddles
poor
jolly
traddles
in
a
tight
suit
that
made
his
arms
and
legs
look
like
german
sausages
he
was
at
once
the
merriest
and
most
miserable
of
all
boys
he
was
always
being
caned
by
that
fierce
creakle
who
made
all
our
backs
tingle
except
after
traddles
had
got
his
daily
caning
he
would
cheer
up
somehow
and
get
comfort
by
drawing
skeletons
all
over
his
slate
he
was
always
drawing
these
skeletons
just
as
he
was
always
getting
caned
and
they
did
comfort
him
somehow
for
presently
he
would
begin
to
laugh
again
before
his
tears
were
dry
he
was
very
honorable
traddles
was
and
held
it
as
a
solemn
duty
in
the
boys
to
stand
by
one
another
he
suffered
for
this
on
several
occasions
and
particularly
once
when
steerforth
laughed
in
church
and
the
beadle
thought
it
was
traddles
and
took
him
out
i
see
him
now
going
away
in
custody
despised
by
the
congregation
he
never
said
who
was
the
real
offender
though
he
smarted
for
it
next
day
and
was
imprisoned
so
many
hours
that
he
came
forth
with
a
whole
churchyard
full
of
skeletons
swarming
all
over
his
latin
dictionary
but
he
had
his
reward
steerforth
said
there
was
nothing
of
the
sneak
in
traddles
and
we
all
felt
that
to
be
the
highest
praise
for
my
part
i
could
have
gone
through
a
good
deal
to
have
won
such
a
reward
although
school
was
not
noted
for
scholarship
i
can
confess
without
vanity
that
i
did
make
good
progress
i
was
naturally
fond
of
books
and
a
great
reader
and
now
i
had
the
first
fair
chance
at
learning
things
in
this
i
found
mell
the
quiet
gentle
tutor
a
constant
friend
to
me
i
shall
always
remember
him
with
gratitude
but
steerforth
i
am
sorry
to
say
did
not
like
the
tutor
and
took
no
pains
to
hide
his
poor
opinion
since
many
of
the
other
boys
followed
lead
poor
mell
was
not
popular
still
nothing
especial
came
of
it
until
one
memorable
day
when
creakle
was
absent
the
boys
seized
the
chance
to
be
uproarious
and
mell
could
not
control
them
finally
even
his
patience
was
exhausted
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
pounded
his
desk
with
a
book
silence
he
cried
this
noise
must
cease
maddening
how
can
you
treat
me
this
way
boys
it
was
my
book
that
he
struck
his
desk
with
and
as
i
stood
beside
him
following
his
eye
as
it
glanced
round
the
room
i
saw
the
boys
all
stop
some
suddenly
surprised
some
half
afraid
and
some
sorry
perhaps
place
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
school
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
long
room
he
was
lounging
with
his
back
against
the
wall
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
looked
at
mell
with
his
mouth
shut
up
as
if
he
were
whistling
when
mell
looked
at
him
silence
mr
steerforth
said
mell
silence
yourself
said
steerforth
turning
red
whom
are
you
talking
to
sit
down
said
mell
sit
down
yourself
said
steerforth
and
mind
your
business
there
was
a
titter
and
some
applause
but
mell
was
so
white
that
there
was
silence
if
you
think
steerforth
said
mell
that
you
can
make
use
of
your
position
of
favoritism
here
to
disobey
rules
and
insult
a
a
what
is
he
said
steerforth
here
somebody
cried
out
shame
steerforth
too
bad
it
was
traddles
whom
mell
instantly
routed
by
bidding
him
hold
his
tongue
to
insult
one
who
is
not
fortunate
in
life
sir
and
who
never
gave
you
the
least
offence
continued
mell
his
lip
trembling
you
commit
a
mean
and
base
action
you
can
sit
down
or
stand
up
as
you
please
sir
copperfield
go
on
young
copperfield
said
steerforth
coming
forward
stop
a
bit
i
tell
you
what
mell
once
for
all
when
you
take
the
liberty
of
calling
men
mean
and
base
or
anything
of
that
sort
you
are
an
impudent
beggar
you
are
always
a
beggar
you
know
but
when
you
do
that
you
are
an
impudent
beggar
i
am
not
clear
whether
he
was
going
to
strike
mell
or
mell
was
going
to
strike
him
or
there
was
any
such
intention
on
either
side
i
saw
a
rigidity
come
upon
the
whole
school
as
if
they
had
been
turned
into
stone
and
found
creakle
in
the
midst
of
us
mell
with
his
elbows
on
his
desk
and
his
face
in
his
hands
sat
for
some
moments
quite
still
mell
said
creakle
shaking
him
by
the
arm
and
his
whisper
was
very
audible
now
you
have
not
forgotten
yourself
i
hope
no
sir
said
mell
creakle
looked
hard
at
him
and
then
turned
to
steerforth
now
sir
will
you
tell
me
what
this
is
about
steerforth
evaded
the
question
for
a
little
while
looking
in
scorn
and
anger
on
his
opponent
and
remaining
silent
i
could
not
help
thinking
what
a
fellow
he
was
and
how
homely
and
plain
mell
looked
opposed
to
him
what
did
he
mean
by
talking
about
favorites
then
said
steerforth
at
length
favorites
repeated
creakle
with
the
veins
in
his
forehead
swelling
quickly
who
talked
about
favorites
he
did
said
steerforth
and
pray
what
did
you
mean
by
that
sir
demanded
creakle
turning
angrily
on
his
assistant
i
meant
creakle
he
returned
in
a
low
voice
as
i
said
that
no
pupil
had
a
right
to
avail
himself
of
his
position
of
favoritism
to
degrade
me
to
degrade
said
creakle
my
stars
but
give
me
leave
to
ask
you
your
name
whether
when
you
talk
about
favorites
you
showed
proper
respect
to
me
to
me
sir
said
creakle
darting
his
head
at
him
suddenly
and
drawing
it
back
again
the
principal
of
this
establishment
and
your
employer
it
was
not
judicious
sir
i
am
willing
to
admit
said
mell
i
should
not
have
done
so
if
i
had
been
cool
here
steerforth
struck
in
then
he
said
i
was
mean
and
then
he
said
i
was
base
and
then
i
called
him
a
beggar
if
had
been
cool
perhaps
i
have
called
him
a
beggar
but
i
did
and
i
am
ready
to
take
the
consequences
of
it
without
considering
perhaps
whether
there
were
any
consequences
to
be
taken
i
felt
quite
in
a
glow
at
this
gallant
speech
it
made
an
impression
on
the
boys
too
for
there
was
a
low
stir
among
them
though
no
one
spoke
a
word
i
am
surprised
steerforth
your
candor
does
you
honor
said
creakle
does
you
honor
certainly
am
surprised
steerforth
i
must
say
that
you
should
attach
such
an
epithet
to
any
person
employed
and
paid
in
salem
house
sir
steerforth
gave
a
short
laugh
not
an
answer
sir
said
creakle
to
my
remark
i
expect
more
than
that
from
you
steerforth
if
mell
looked
homely
in
my
eyes
before
the
handsome
boy
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
say
how
homely
creakle
looked
let
him
deny
it
said
steerforth
deny
that
he
is
a
beggar
steerforth
cried
creakle
why
where
does
he
go
a
begging
if
he
is
not
a
beggar
himself
his
near
one
said
steerforth
all
the
same
what
do
you
mean
since
you
expect
me
creakle
to
justify
myself
said
steerforth
and
to
say
what
i
mean
i
have
to
say
is
that
his
mother
lives
on
charity
in
an
almshouse
creakle
turned
to
his
assistant
with
a
severe
frown
and
labored
politeness
now
you
hear
what
this
gentleman
says
mell
have
the
goodness
if
you
please
to
set
him
right
before
the
assembled
school
he
is
right
sir
without
correction
returned
mell
in
the
midst
of
a
dead
silence
what
he
has
said
is
true
be
so
good
then
as
to
declare
publicly
will
you
said
creakle
putting
his
head
on
one
side
and
rolling
his
eyes
round
the
school
whether
it
ever
came
to
my
knowledge
until
this
moment
i
believe
not
directly
he
returned
why
you
not
said
creakle
you
man
sir
i
think
you
knew
my
circumstances
when
i
came
here
and
that
a
bare
living
i
think
if
you
come
to
that
said
creakle
with
his
veins
swelling
again
bigger
than
ever
that
been
in
a
wrong
position
altogether
and
mistook
this
for
a
charity
school
mell
part
if
you
please
the
sooner
the
better
there
is
no
time
answered
mell
rising
like
the
present
sir
to
you
said
creakle
i
take
my
leave
of
you
creakle
and
of
all
of
you
said
mell
glancing
round
the
room
and
patting
me
gently
on
the
shoulder
james
steerforth
the
best
wish
i
can
leave
you
is
that
you
may
come
to
be
ashamed
of
what
you
have
done
at
present
i
would
prefer
to
see
you
anything
rather
than
a
friend
to
me
or
to
any
one
in
whom
i
feel
an
interest
then
mell
walked
out
with
his
property
under
his
arm
creakle
made
a
speech
in
which
he
thanked
steerforth
for
asserting
though
perhaps
too
warmly
the
independence
and
respectability
of
salem
house
and
which
he
wound
up
by
shaking
hands
with
steerforth
while
we
gave
three
cheers
did
not
quite
know
what
for
but
i
suppose
for
steerforth
and
so
joined
in
them
ardently
though
i
felt
miserable
creakle
then
caned
tommy
traddles
for
being
discovered
in
tears
instead
of
cheers
on
account
of
departure
and
went
back
to
his
sofa
or
wherever
he
had
come
from
when
he
had
gone
there
was
an
awkward
silence
somehow
we
all
felt
uncomfortable
or
ashamed
as
for
steerforth
he
said
he
was
angry
with
traddles
and
glad
he
had
caught
it
poor
traddles
who
was
relieving
himself
as
usual
with
a
burst
of
skeletons
said
he
care
mell
was
who
has
him
you
girl
said
steerforth
why
have
returned
traddles
what
have
i
done
said
steerforth
what
have
you
done
retorted
traddles
hurt
his
feelings
and
lost
him
his
situation
his
feelings
repeated
steerforth
disdainfully
his
feelings
will
soon
get
the
better
of
it
be
bound
his
feelings
are
not
like
yours
miss
traddles
as
to
his
situation
was
a
precious
one
it
you
suppose
i
am
not
going
to
write
home
and
take
care
that
he
gets
some
money
polly
we
thought
this
intention
very
noble
in
steerforth
whose
mother
was
a
widow
and
rich
and
would
do
almost
anything
it
was
said
that
he
asked
her
we
were
all
extremely
glad
to
see
traddles
so
put
down
and
exalted
steerforth
to
the
skies
but
as
i
look
back
at
it
now
i
should
rather
have
been
traddles
that
day
than
any
other
boy
in
the
room
and
i
think
the
other
boys
will
say
so
too
i
pass
over
all
that
happened
at
school
until
the
anniversary
of
my
birthday
came
round
in
march
except
that
steerforth
was
more
to
be
admired
than
ever
i
remember
nothing
he
was
going
away
at
the
end
of
the
if
not
sooner
and
was
more
spirited
and
independent
than
ever
but
beyond
this
i
remember
nothing
the
great
event
by
which
that
time
is
marked
in
my
mind
seems
to
have
swallowed
up
all
lesser
recollections
and
to
exist
alone
it
was
after
breakfast
and
we
had
been
summoned
in
from
the
playground
when
creakle
entered
and
said
david
copperfield
is
to
go
into
the
parlor
i
expected
a
hamper
from
peggotty
and
brightened
at
the
order
some
of
the
boys
about
me
put
in
their
claim
not
to
be
forgotten
in
the
distribution
of
the
good
things
as
i
got
out
of
my
seat
with
great
alacrity
but
when
i
reached
the
parlor
i
saw
no
one
except
creakle
who
held
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
and
looked
at
me
gravely
you
are
too
young
to
know
how
the
world
changes
every
day
said
creakle
and
how
the
people
in
it
pass
away
but
we
all
have
to
learn
it
david
some
of
us
when
we
are
young
some
of
us
when
we
are
old
some
of
us
at
all
times
of
our
lives
i
looked
at
her
earnestly
when
you
came
away
from
home
said
creakle
after
a
pause
were
they
all
well
after
another
pause
was
your
mamma
well
i
trembled
without
distinctly
knowing
why
and
still
looked
at
her
earnestly
making
no
attempt
to
answer
because
said
she
i
grieve
to
tell
you
that
i
hear
this
morning
your
mamma
is
very
a
mist
arose
between
creakle
and
me
and
her
figure
seemed
to
move
in
it
for
an
instant
then
i
felt
the
burning
tears
run
down
my
face
and
it
was
steady
again
she
is
very
dangerously
ill
she
added
i
knew
all
now
she
is
dead
there
was
no
need
to
tell
me
so
i
had
already
broken
out
into
a
desolate
cry
and
felt
an
orphan
in
the
wide
world
she
was
very
kind
to
me
she
kept
me
there
all
day
and
left
me
alone
sometimes
and
i
cried
and
wore
myself
to
sleep
and
awoke
and
cried
again
the
next
night
i
left
salem
house
after
a
tender
adieu
to
steerforth
traddles
and
all
the
rest
i
little
thought
that
i
left
the
school
never
to
return
when
i
reached
home
i
was
in
arms
before
i
got
to
the
door
and
she
took
me
into
the
house
her
grief
burst
out
when
she
first
saw
me
but
she
controlled
it
soon
and
spoke
in
whispers
and
walked
softly
as
if
the
dead
could
be
disturbed
she
had
not
been
in
bed
i
found
for
a
long
time
she
sat
up
at
night
still
and
watched
as
long
as
her
poor
dear
pretty
was
above
the
ground
she
said
she
would
never
desert
her
murdstone
took
no
heed
of
me
when
i
went
into
the
parlor
where
he
was
but
sat
by
the
fireside
weeping
silently
and
pondering
in
his
miss
murdstone
who
was
busy
at
her
which
was
covered
with
letters
and
papers
gave
me
her
cold
and
asked
me
in
an
iron
whisper
if
i
had
been
measured
for
my
mourning
i
will
not
dwell
upon
the
dull
sorrowful
days
before
and
after
my
dear
funeral
the
house
had
been
cold
and
quiet
enough
before
but
was
now
almost
terrifying
and
had
it
not
been
for
peggotty
i
do
not
know
how
i
should
have
stood
it
but
soon
even
she
was
denied
me
miss
murdstone
had
never
liked
her
and
now
lost
no
time
in
dismissing
her
from
our
service
the
single
ray
of
light
in
this
gloomy
time
is
a
little
visit
i
was
allowed
to
make
with
her
to
yarmouth
to
our
old
friends
peggotty
ham
and
emily
the
latter
was
much
grown
now
but
prettier
than
ever
and
shyer
about
letting
me
kiss
her
and
barkis
the
honest
carrier
after
having
been
willing
all
this
time
was
hugely
gratified
to
gain
a
favorable
answer
from
peggotty
they
were
married
while
i
was
there
and
i
was
glad
to
leave
my
faithful
old
nurse
so
well
provided
for
then
i
returned
i
can
not
say
that
and
miss
murdstone
i
begin
life
on
my
own
and
now
i
fell
into
a
state
of
neglect
which
i
can
not
look
back
upon
without
sorrow
i
was
as
one
from
all
friendly
notice
apart
from
the
society
of
all
other
boys
of
my
own
age
apart
from
all
companionship
but
my
own
spiritless
thoughts
seems
to
cast
its
gloom
upon
this
paper
as
i
write
what
would
i
have
given
to
have
been
sent
to
the
hardest
school
that
ever
was
have
been
taught
something
anyhow
anywhere
no
such
hope
dawned
upon
me
they
disliked
me
and
they
steadily
overlooked
me
i
think
means
were
straitened
at
about
this
time
but
it
is
little
to
the
purpose
he
could
not
bear
me
and
in
putting
me
from
him
he
tried
as
i
believe
to
put
away
the
notion
that
i
had
any
claim
upon
succeeded
i
was
not
actively
i
was
not
beaten
or
starved
but
day
by
day
i
was
made
to
feel
that
i
was
in
the
way
and
an
altogether
useless
member
of
society
finally
murdstone
called
me
to
him
one
day
and
told
me
that
he
could
not
afford
to
send
me
to
school
but
that
i
must
go
to
work
for
myself
he
had
a
partner
in
the
wine
trade
in
london
and
i
was
to
be
given
a
position
there
accordingly
miss
murdstone
packed
me
off
without
loss
of
time
and
i
went
to
ten
years
bottles
in
a
warehouse
down
by
the
there
were
three
or
four
of
us
boys
counting
me
and
i
was
shown
how
to
work
by
an
older
lad
whose
name
was
mick
walker
and
who
wore
a
ragged
apron
and
paper
cap
he
introduced
me
to
another
boy
by
the
queer
name
of
mealy
potatoes
i
discovered
later
that
this
youth
had
started
out
with
another
name
but
had
been
given
this
one
on
account
of
a
pale
mealy
complexion
no
words
can
express
the
secret
agony
of
my
soul
as
i
sank
into
this
companionship
compared
these
associates
with
those
of
my
happier
to
say
with
steerforth
traddles
and
the
rest
of
those
boys
and
felt
my
hopes
of
growing
up
to
be
a
learned
and
distinguished
man
crushed
in
my
bosom
the
feeling
of
being
utterly
without
hope
of
the
shame
i
felt
in
my
position
of
the
misery
it
was
to
believe
that
what
i
had
learned
would
pass
away
from
me
little
by
little
never
to
be
brought
back
any
more
can
not
be
written
as
often
as
mick
walker
went
away
in
the
course
of
that
forenoon
i
mingled
my
tears
with
the
water
in
which
i
was
washing
the
bottles
but
i
was
careful
never
to
let
the
others
see
me
in
tears
i
was
given
the
splendid
salary
of
seven
shillings
a
week
for
my
services
and
out
of
that
i
had
to
feed
and
clothe
myself
my
lodgings
were
provided
for
at
the
home
of
a
micawber
a
portly
dignified
man
with
a
large
shiny
bald
head
and
rusty
genteel
clothes
micawber
was
perpetually
dodging
creditors
while
he
waited
for
something
to
turn
up
as
he
expressed
it
but
in
his
way
he
was
kind
to
me
about
still
i
had
no
one
upon
earth
to
go
to
for
friendship
or
advice
i
must
needs
skimp
and
save
to
be
sure
of
having
enough
bread
and
cheese
to
eat
and
no
one
lifted
a
finger
to
help
me
a
frightened
little
stranger
in
a
large
terrifying
city
i
look
back
upon
it
now
as
a
horrible
dream
i
know
that
i
worked
from
morning
till
night
with
common
men
and
boys
a
shabby
child
i
know
that
i
lounged
about
the
streets
poorly
clothed
and
half
starved
i
know
that
but
for
the
mercy
of
god
i
might
easily
have
any
other
care
that
was
taken
of
little
thief
or
vagabond
but
in
these
darkest
days
a
bright
idea
came
to
know
when
or
how
but
come
it
did
and
refused
to
depart
i
remembered
having
heard
of
an
aunt
miss
betsey
trotwood
my
dear
sister
i
had
heard
both
my
mother
and
peggotty
speak
of
her
with
some
awe
it
is
true
as
being
a
rather
eccentric
woman
who
did
not
like
boys
but
still
i
resolved
to
find
her
so
i
wrote
to
peggotty
and
asked
the
address
and
also
for
the
loan
of
half
a
guinea
i
had
resolved
to
run
away
and
appeal
to
my
aunt
for
protection
answer
soon
came
with
much
love
and
the
half
guinea
she
told
me
that
miss
betsey
lived
near
dover
but
she
say
exactly
where
this
was
vague
enough
but
deter
me
in
the
slightest
i
worked
my
week
out
at
the
warehouse
and
bidding
mick
walker
and
mealy
potatoes
ran
away
forthwith
i
may
have
had
the
notion
of
running
all
the
way
to
dover
when
i
started
i
had
a
small
box
of
clothes
and
the
half
guinea
but
a
carter
robbed
me
of
both
of
them
the
first
day
so
reduced
to
a
few
odd
pence
i
made
but
slow
progress
on
foot
and
sleeping
out
in
the
open
by
night
for
six
days
i
trudged
my
weary
way
pawning
my
coat
for
food
and
not
daring
to
ask
aid
from
any
one
for
fear
of
being
seized
and
sent
back
to
london
but
at
last
i
limped
in
upon
the
bare
white
downs
near
dover
sunburnt
and
in
rags
by
dint
of
inquiries
i
was
directed
to
miss
betsey
house
and
i
lost
no
time
in
going
sorry
enough
figure
as
you
may
imagine
it
was
a
neat
little
cottage
looking
out
from
some
cliffs
upon
the
sea
as
i
stood
at
the
gate
peeping
in
and
wondering
how
i
had
best
proceed
a
tall
slim
lady
came
out
of
the
house
she
had
a
handkerchief
tied
over
her
cap
a
pair
of
gloves
on
her
hands
and
carried
a
go
away
said
miss
betsey
for
it
was
none
other
shaking
her
head
when
she
saw
me
and
making
a
distant
chop
in
the
air
with
her
knife
go
along
no
boys
here
i
watched
her
with
my
heart
at
my
lips
as
she
marched
to
a
corner
of
her
garden
and
stooped
to
dig
a
root
then
without
a
scrap
of
courage
but
with
a
great
deal
of
desperation
i
went
softly
in
and
stood
beside
her
touching
her
with
my
finger
if
you
please
i
began
she
started
and
looked
up
if
you
please
aunt
eh
exclaimed
miss
betsey
in
a
tone
of
amazement
i
have
never
heard
approached
if
you
please
aunt
i
am
your
nephew
oh
lord
said
my
aunt
and
sat
flat
down
in
the
i
am
david
copperfield
of
the
rookery
i
used
to
hear
my
dear
mamma
speak
of
you
before
she
died
i
have
been
neglected
and
mistreated
and
so
i
ran
away
and
came
to
you
i
was
robbed
at
first
setting
out
and
have
walked
all
the
way
and
have
never
slept
in
a
bed
since
i
began
the
journey
here
my
gave
way
all
at
once
and
with
a
movement
of
my
hands
intended
to
show
her
my
ragged
state
and
call
it
to
witness
that
i
had
suffered
something
i
broke
into
a
passion
of
crying
which
i
suppose
had
been
pent
up
within
me
all
the
week
my
aunt
with
every
sort
of
expression
sat
on
the
gravel
staring
at
me
until
i
began
to
cry
when
she
got
up
in
a
great
hurry
collared
me
and
took
me
into
the
parlor
her
first
proceeding
there
was
to
unlock
a
tall
press
bring
out
several
bottles
and
pour
some
of
the
contents
of
each
into
my
mouth
i
think
they
must
have
been
taken
out
at
random
for
i
am
sure
i
tasted
aniseed
water
anchovy
sauce
and
salad
dressing
then
she
rang
the
bell
janet
she
said
when
her
servant
came
in
go
upstairs
give
my
compliments
to
dick
and
say
i
wish
to
speak
to
him
dick
proved
to
be
a
man
of
whimsical
ways
but
upon
whose
advice
my
aunt
greatly
relied
as
he
proposed
now
that
i
be
given
a
bath
and
put
to
bed
my
aunt
lost
no
time
in
following
these
ideas
janet
had
gone
away
to
get
the
bath
ready
when
my
aunt
to
my
great
alarm
became
in
one
moment
rigid
with
wrath
and
had
hardly
voice
to
cry
out
janet
donkeys
upon
which
janet
came
running
up
the
stairs
as
if
the
house
were
in
flames
darted
out
on
a
little
piece
of
green
in
front
and
warned
off
two
donkeys
that
had
presumed
to
set
hoof
upon
it
while
my
aunt
rushing
out
of
the
house
seized
the
bridle
of
a
third
animal
led
him
forth
from
those
sacred
precincts
and
boxed
the
ears
of
the
unlucky
urchin
in
attendance
to
this
hour
i
know
whether
my
aunt
had
any
lawful
right
of
way
over
that
patch
of
green
but
she
had
settled
it
in
her
own
mind
that
she
had
and
it
was
all
the
same
to
her
the
one
great
outrage
of
her
life
demanding
to
be
constantly
avenged
was
the
passage
of
a
donkey
over
that
spot
no
matter
what
she
was
doing
or
saying
a
donkey
turned
the
current
of
her
ideas
in
a
moment
and
she
was
upon
him
straight
jugs
of
water
and
were
kept
in
secret
places
ready
to
be
discharged
on
the
offending
boys
sticks
were
laid
in
ambush
behind
the
door
sallies
were
made
at
all
hours
and
incessant
war
prevailed
perhaps
this
was
an
agreeable
excitement
to
the
or
perhaps
the
more
sagacious
of
the
donkeys
understanding
how
the
case
stood
stubbornly
delighted
in
coming
that
way
i
only
know
that
there
were
three
alarms
before
the
bath
was
ready
and
that
on
the
occasion
of
the
last
and
most
desperate
of
all
i
saw
my
aunt
engage
with
a
lad
of
fifteen
and
bump
his
sandy
head
against
her
own
gate
before
he
realized
what
was
the
matter
these
interruptions
were
the
more
ridiculous
to
me
because
she
was
giving
me
broth
out
of
a
tablespoon
at
the
time
having
firmly
persuaded
herself
that
i
was
actually
starving
and
must
receive
food
at
first
in
very
small
quantities
and
while
my
mouth
was
yet
open
to
receive
the
spoon
she
would
put
it
back
into
the
basin
cry
janet
donkeys
and
go
out
to
the
assault
the
bath
was
a
great
comfort
for
i
began
to
be
sensible
of
acute
pains
in
my
limbs
from
lying
out
in
the
fields
and
was
now
so
tired
and
low
that
i
could
hardly
keep
myself
awake
for
five
minutes
together
when
i
had
bathed
they
enrobed
me
in
a
shirt
and
a
pair
of
trousers
belonging
to
dick
and
tied
me
up
in
two
or
three
great
shawls
what
sort
of
bundle
i
looked
like
i
know
but
i
felt
a
very
hot
one
feeling
also
very
faint
and
drowsy
i
soon
fell
asleep
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
my
aunt
said
with
a
determined
shake
of
her
head
well
written
to
him
to
whom
i
ventured
to
mr
murdstone
does
he
know
where
i
am
aunt
i
inquired
alarmed
i
have
told
him
said
my
aunt
with
a
nod
shall
up
to
him
i
faltered
i
know
said
my
aunt
we
shall
see
oh
i
think
what
i
shall
do
i
exclaimed
if
i
have
to
go
back
to
mr
murdstone
i
know
anything
about
it
said
my
aunt
shaking
her
head
i
say
i
am
sure
we
shall
see
my
spirits
sank
under
these
words
and
i
became
very
downcast
and
heavy
of
heart
for
the
next
few
days
i
felt
like
a
criminal
condemned
to
die
although
my
aunt
and
dick
both
were
very
kind
to
me
finally
the
day
of
the
expected
visit
from
murdstone
arrived
but
without
bringing
him
till
late
in
the
afternoon
our
dinner
had
been
postponed
but
it
was
growing
so
late
that
my
aunt
had
ordered
it
to
be
got
ready
when
she
gave
a
sudden
alarm
of
donkeys
and
to
my
consternation
i
beheld
miss
murdstone
on
a
ride
deliberately
over
the
sacred
piece
of
green
and
stop
in
front
of
the
house
looking
about
her
go
along
with
you
cried
my
aunt
shaking
her
head
and
her
fist
out
of
the
window
you
have
no
business
there
how
dare
you
trespass
go
along
oh
you
thing
my
aunt
was
so
exasperated
by
the
coolness
with
which
miss
murdstone
looked
about
her
that
i
really
believe
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
hastened
to
tell
her
who
it
was
and
that
murdstone
was
following
behind
but
it
made
no
difference
she
glared
at
them
as
they
entered
the
room
in
a
most
terrible
way
oh
said
my
aunt
i
was
not
aware
at
first
to
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
objecting
but
i
allow
anybody
to
ride
over
that
turf
i
make
no
exceptions
i
allow
anybody
to
do
it
your
regulation
is
rather
awkward
to
strangers
said
miss
murdstone
it
said
my
aunt
murdstone
here
cleared
his
throat
and
began
miss
i
beg
your
pardon
observed
my
aunt
with
a
keen
look
you
are
the
mr
murdstone
i
am
said
murdstone
excuse
my
saying
sir
returned
my
aunt
that
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
much
better
and
happier
thing
if
you
had
left
that
poor
child
alone
murdstone
colored
and
miss
murdstone
looked
as
though
she
could
bite
nails
i
received
your
letter
said
murdstone
and
thought
it
best
to
see
you
personally
about
this
unhappy
boy
who
has
run
away
from
his
friends
and
his
position
i
need
not
tell
you
that
he
has
always
given
us
great
trouble
and
uneasiness
he
is
sullen
and
stubborn
and
has
a
violent
temper
i
thought
it
best
that
you
should
know
this
it
can
hardly
be
necessary
for
me
to
confirm
anything
stated
by
my
brother
said
miss
murdstone
but
i
beg
to
observe
that
of
all
the
boys
in
the
world
i
believe
this
is
the
worst
boy
strong
said
my
aunt
shortly
but
not
at
all
too
strong
for
the
facts
returned
miss
murdstone
ha
said
my
aunt
well
sir
upon
the
death
of
his
mother
continued
murdstone
scowling
i
obtained
a
respectable
place
for
was
it
the
sort
of
place
you
would
have
put
a
boy
of
your
own
in
asked
my
aunt
if
he
had
been
my
own
boy
returned
miss
murdstone
striking
in
his
character
i
trust
would
have
been
altogether
different
or
if
the
poor
child
his
mother
had
been
alive
he
would
still
have
gone
into
the
respectable
business
would
he
said
my
aunt
i
believe
said
murdstone
with
a
nod
of
his
head
that
clara
would
have
disputed
nothing
which
myself
and
my
sister
were
agreed
was
for
the
best
humph
said
my
aunt
well
sir
what
next
merely
this
miss
trotwood
he
returned
i
am
here
to
take
david
take
him
back
unconditionally
and
to
deal
with
him
as
i
think
right
i
am
not
here
to
make
any
promise
to
anybody
you
may
possibly
have
some
idea
miss
trotwood
of
abetting
him
in
his
running
away
your
manner
induces
me
to
think
it
possible
now
i
must
caution
you
that
if
you
abet
him
once
you
abet
him
for
good
and
all
i
can
not
trifle
or
be
trifled
with
i
am
here
for
the
first
and
last
time
to
take
him
away
is
he
ready
to
go
if
he
is
not
my
doors
are
shut
against
him
henceforth
and
yours
i
take
it
for
granted
are
opened
to
him
to
this
address
my
aunt
had
listened
with
the
closest
attention
sitting
perfectly
upright
with
her
hands
folded
on
one
knee
and
looking
grimly
on
the
speaker
when
he
had
finished
she
turned
her
eyes
so
as
to
command
miss
murdstone
and
said
well
have
you
got
anything
to
remark
indeed
miss
trotwood
said
miss
murdstone
all
that
i
could
say
has
been
so
well
said
by
my
brother
that
i
have
nothing
to
add
except
my
thanks
for
your
politeness
this
ironical
remark
however
was
wholly
lost
and
what
does
the
boy
say
said
my
aunt
are
you
ready
to
go
david
i
answered
no
and
entreated
her
not
to
let
me
go
i
said
that
neither
nor
miss
murdstone
had
ever
liked
me
or
had
ever
been
kind
to
me
that
they
had
made
my
mamma
who
always
loved
me
dearly
unhappy
about
me
and
that
i
knew
it
well
and
that
peggotty
knew
it
and
i
begged
and
prayed
my
forget
in
what
terms
now
but
i
remember
that
they
affected
me
very
much
befriend
and
protect
me
for
my
sake
dick
said
my
aunt
what
shall
i
do
with
this
child
have
him
measured
for
a
suit
of
clothes
directly
said
dick
in
his
usual
sudden
way
dick
said
my
aunt
triumphantly
give
me
your
hand
for
your
common
sense
is
invaluable
having
shaken
it
with
great
cordiality
she
pulled
me
towards
her
and
said
to
murdstone
you
can
go
when
you
like
take
my
chance
with
the
boy
if
all
you
say
he
is
at
least
i
can
do
as
much
for
him
then
as
you
have
done
but
i
believe
a
word
of
it
miss
trotwood
rejoined
murdstone
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
he
rose
if
you
were
a
bah
stuff
and
nonsense
said
my
aunt
talk
to
me
how
exquisitely
polite
exclaimed
miss
murdstone
rising
overpowering
really
do
you
think
i
know
said
my
aunt
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
the
sister
and
continuing
to
address
the
brother
and
to
shake
her
head
at
him
what
kind
of
life
you
must
have
led
that
poor
little
woman
you
cajoled
into
marrying
you
do
you
think
i
know
what
a
woeful
day
it
was
for
her
and
her
boy
when
first
came
in
her
way
and
thereupon
she
read
him
such
a
lecture
as
i
warrant
he
had
never
listened
to
before
in
his
life
nor
ever
would
again
he
bit
his
lip
in
silence
while
she
lectured
and
all
the
color
left
his
face
miss
murdstone
tried
to
interrupt
the
flow
of
words
repeatedly
with
no
success
at
all
when
she
had
good
day
sir
said
my
aunt
and
good
day
to
you
too
turning
suddenly
upon
his
sister
let
me
see
you
ride
a
donkey
over
green
again
and
as
sure
as
you
have
a
head
upon
your
shoulders
knock
your
bonnet
off
and
tread
upon
it
it
would
require
a
painter
and
no
common
painter
too
to
depict
my
face
as
she
delivered
herself
of
this
very
unexpected
sentiment
and
miss
face
as
she
heard
it
but
the
manner
of
the
speech
no
less
than
the
matter
was
so
fiery
that
miss
murdstone
without
a
word
in
answer
discreetly
put
her
arm
through
her
and
walked
haughtily
out
of
the
cottage
my
aunt
remaining
in
the
window
looking
after
them
prepared
i
have
no
doubt
to
carry
her
threat
into
instant
execution
no
attempt
at
defiance
being
made
however
her
face
gradually
relaxed
and
became
so
pleasant
that
i
was
emboldened
to
kiss
and
thank
her
which
i
did
with
great
heartiness
and
with
both
my
arms
clasped
round
her
neck
i
then
shook
hands
with
dick
who
shook
hands
with
me
a
great
many
times
and
hailed
this
happy
close
of
the
proceedings
with
repeated
bursts
of
laughter
consider
yourself
guardian
jointly
with
me
of
this
child
dick
said
my
aunt
i
shall
be
delighted
said
dick
to
be
the
guardian
of
son
very
good
returned
my
aunt
settled
i
have
been
thinking
do
you
know
dick
that
i
might
call
him
trotwood
yes
to
be
sure
trotwood
copperfield
said
dick
my
aunt
took
so
kindly
to
the
notion
that
some
clothes
which
were
purchased
for
me
the
next
day
were
marked
trotwood
copperfield
in
her
own
handwriting
and
in
indelible
before
i
put
them
on
thus
i
began
my
new
life
in
a
new
name
and
with
everything
new
about
me
now
that
the
state
of
doubt
was
over
i
felt
for
many
days
like
one
in
a
dream
i
never
thought
that
i
had
a
curious
couple
of
guardians
in
my
aunt
and
dick
i
never
thought
of
anything
about
myself
distinctly
while
a
remoteness
had
come
upon
the
old
seemed
to
lie
in
the
haze
of
an
immeasurable
distance
in
my
new
life
i
was
to
realize
some
of
my
youthful
ambitions
i
was
to
struggle
perhaps
but
i
was
to
succeed
and
i
was
to
find
that
my
all
her
gruff
a
heart
of
gold
but
whatever
there
was
of
happiness
or
of
sorrow
of
success
or
of
failure
in
my
new
life
does
not
belong

of
the

of
