third
edition
has
been
revised
and
chapter
is
entirely
chapter
i
introductory
a
word
of
wisdom
found
written
like
the
most
ancient
on
leather
old
men
boots
do
go
there
sir
said
the
bootmaker
to
me
one
day
as
he
pointed
to
the
toes
of
a
pair
i
had
just
brought
him
for
mending
it
was
a
significant
observation
i
thought
and
as
i
went
on
my
way
home
writing
another
such
chronicle
with
every
springing
step
it
filled
me
with
much
reflection
largely
of
the
nature
of
platitude
i
have
little
doubt
such
reflection
reader
as
is
even
already
i
doubt
less
rippling
the
surface
of
your
mind
with
circles
yes
you
sigh
with
an
air
it
is
in
the
unconscious
autobiographies
we
are
every
moment
writing
not
those
we
publish
in
two
volumes
and
a
supplement
where
the
truth
about
us
is
hid
truly
it
is
a
thought
that
has
dead
bosoms
i
agree
but
why
be
afraid
of
it
for
that
reader
truth
is
not
become
a
platitude
only
in
our
day
knew
it
for
such
some
considerable
time
ago
and
yet
he
did
not
fear
to
and
set
in
order
many
proverbs
you
have
kept
a
diary
for
how
many
years
thirty
dear
me
but
have
you
kept
your
if
you
ever
engage
me
to
write
that
life
which
of
course
must
some
day
be
written
i
would
write
it
myself
trouble
about
your
diary
lend
me
your
private
ledger
the
action
lies
in
his
true
nature
yet
i
should
hardly
perhaps
have
evoked
this
particular
corollary
from
that
man
of
leather
observation
if
i
had
not
chanced
one
evening
to
come
across
those
old
of
my
friend
narcissus
about
which
i
have
undertaken
to
write
here
and
been
struck
by
the
wonderful
manner
in
which
there
lay
revealed
in
them
the
story
of
the
years
over
which
they
ran
to
a
stranger
i
am
sure
they
would
be
full
of
meaning
but
to
me
who
lived
so
near
him
through
so
much
of
the
time
how
truly
pregnant
does
each
briefest
entry
seem
to
oldbuck
and
sons
they
alas
often
came
to
be
but
so
many
accounts
rendered
to
you
being
a
philosopher
they
would
as
i
have
said
mean
more
but
to
me
they
mean
all
that
great
sunrise
the
youth
of
narcissus
many
modern
poets
still
young
enough
are
fond
of
telling
us
where
their
youth
lies
buried
that
of
narcissus
would
ye
know
rests
among
these
old
accounts
lo
i
would
perform
an
incantation
i
throw
these
old
leaves
into
the
of
sweet
memory
as
heidegger
that
old
rose
into
his
wonderful
crystal
water
have
i
power
to
make
narcissus
rose
to
bloom
again
so
that
you
may
know
something
of
the
beauty
it
wore
for
us
i
wonder
i
would
i
had
i
must
try
chapter
ii
still
introductory
but
this
time
of
a
greater
than
the
writer
on
the
side
of
tithefields
just
as
one
turns
out
of
prince
street
in
a
certain
lancashire
town
is
the
unobtrusive
bookshop
of
samuel
dale
it
must
however
be
a
very
superficial
glance
which
does
not
discover
in
it
something
characteristic
distinguishing
it
from
other
shops
of
the
same
size
and
style
there
are
alas
treatises
on
farriery
in
the
window
geographies
chemistries
and
french
grammars
on
the
trestles
outside
for
samuel
albeit
so
great
a
philosopher
as
indeed
to
have
founded
quite
a
school
must
nevertheless
live
those
two
cigars
and
that
of
whiskey
which
he
purchases
with
such
a
fine
solemnity
as
he
and
i
go
home
together
for
occasional
symposia
in
his
bachelor
lodging
those
i
say
come
not
without
sale
of
such
treatises
such
geographies
chemistries
and
french
grammars
but
i
am
digressing
there
is
a
distinguishing
air
i
but
meant
to
say
about
the
little
shop
looking
closer
one
generally
finds
that
it
comes
of
a
choice
bit
of
old
binding
or
the
quaint
of
some
tuneful
elizabethan
it
was
an
old
crashaw
that
first
drew
me
inside
and
though
for
some
reason
i
did
not
buy
it
then
i
bought
it
a
year
after
because
to
it
i
owed
the
friendship
of
samuel
dale
and
thus
for
three
bright
years
that
little
shop
came
to
be
for
a
daily
hour
or
so
a
blessed
away
from
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
noon
a
holy
place
whither
the
and
such
as
sold
doves
might
never
come
let
their
clamour
in
the
outer
courts
ring
never
so
loud
there
in
samuel
talk
did
two
of
egypt
draw
a
breath
of
the
infinite
into
their
lives
of
the
desk
there
could
they
sit
awhile
by
the
eternal
springs
and
feel
the
beating
of
the
central
heart
so
it
happened
one
afternoon
about
five
years
ago
that
i
dropped
in
there
according
to
wont
but
samuel
was
engaged
with
some
one
in
that
dim
corner
at
the
far
end
of
the
shop
where
his
desk
and
tripod
of
that
new
philosophy
stood
so
i
turned
to
a
neighbouring
shelf
to
fill
the
time
at
first
i
did
not
notice
his
visitor
but
as
in
taking
down
this
book
and
that
i
had
come
nearer
to
the
talkers
i
was
struck
with
something
familiar
in
the
voice
of
the
stranger
it
came
upon
me
like
an
old
song
and
looking
up
why
of
course
it
was
narcissus
the
letter
n
does
not
make
one
of
the
initials
on
the
gladstone
bag
which
he
had
with
him
on
that
occasion
and
which
filled
with
books
lay
open
on
the
floor
close
by
nor
does
it
appear
on
any
of
those
or
handkerchiefs
with
which
men
beloved
of
fair
women
are
familiar
and
narcissus
might
moreover
truthfully
say
that
has
never
appeared
upon
any
manner
of
stamped
paper
coming
under
a
certain
notable
act
to
be
less
indulgent
to
a
vice
from
which
the
reader
will
i
fear
have
too
frequent
occasion
to
suffer
in
these
pages
and
for
which
he
may
have
a
stronger
term
than
digression
let
me
at
once
say
that
narcissus
is
but
the
name
love
knew
him
by
love
and
the
reader
for
that
name
by
which
he
was
known
to
the
postman
and
others
is
no
necessity
here
how
and
why
he
came
to
be
so
named
will
appear
soon
enough
yes
it
was
the
same
old
narcissus
and
he
was
wielding
just
the
same
old
magic
i
could
see
as
in
our
and
playgrounds
five
years
before
what
is
it
in
him
that
made
all
men
take
him
so
on
his
own
terms
made
his
talk
hold
one
so
though
it
so
often
stumbled
in
the
dark
and
fell
dumb
on
many
a
verbal
whatever
it
is
samuel
felt
it
and
with
that
fine
worshipful
spirit
of
his
an
attitude
which
always
reminds
me
of
the
elders
listening
to
the
boy
jesus
was
doing
that
homage
for
which
no
beauty
or
greatness
ever
appeals
to
him
in
vain
what
an
eye
for
soul
has
samuel
how
inevitably
it
pierces
through
all
husks
and
excrescences
to
the
central
beauty
in
that
short
talk
he
knew
narcissus
through
and
through
three
years
or
thirty
years
could
add
but
little
but
the
talk
was
not
ended
yet
indeed
it
seemed
like
so
many
of
those
tithefields
talks
as
if
in
the
fitness
of
things
it
never
could
would
or
should
end
it
was
i
at
last
who
gave
it
pause
and
yes
indeed
it
was
he
we
had
somehow
not
met
for
quite
three
years
chums
as
we
had
been
at
school
he
had
left
there
for
an
office
some
time
before
i
did
and
oddly
enough
this
was
our
first
meeting
since
then
a
purchaser
for
one
of
those
aforesaid
treatises
on
farriery
just
then
coming
in
dislodged
us
so
bidding
samuel
he
and
narcissus
already
arranging
for
night
we
obeyed
a
mutual
instinct
and
presently
found
ourselves
in
the
snuggery
of
a
quaint
tavern
which
was
often
to
figure
hereafter
in
our
sentimental
history
though
probably
little
in
these
particular
chapters
of
it
the
things
done
at
the
mermaid
may
some
day
be
written
in
another
place
where
the
reader
will
know
from
the
beginning
what
to
expect
and
not
feel
that
he
has
been
induced
to
buy
a
volume
under
false
pretences
chapter
iii
in
which
narcissus
opens
his
though
it
was
so
long
since
we
had
met
is
not
three
years
indeed
long
in
youth
we
had
hardly
to
wait
for
our
second
glass
to
be
again
few
men
grow
so
rapidly
as
narcissus
did
in
those
young
days
but
fewer
still
can
look
back
on
old
enthusiasms
and
superannuated
ideals
with
a
tenderness
so
delicately
considerate
most
men
hasten
to
witness
their
present
altitude
by
kicking
away
the
old
ladders
on
the
first
opportunity
like
vulgar
lovers
they
seek
to
flatter
at
the
expense
of
yesterday
but
narcissus
was
of
another
fibre
he
could
as
soon
have
insulted
the
memory
of
his
first
love
so
before
long
we
had
passed
together
into
a
sweet
necropolis
of
dreams
whither
if
the
reader
care
i
will
soon
take
him
by
the
hand
but
just
now
i
would
have
him
concern
himself
with
the
afternoon
of
which
i
write
in
that
sad
tense
the
past
present
indeed
we
did
not
ourselves
tarry
long
among
the
shades
for
we
were
young
and
youth
has
little
use
for
the
preterite
its
verbs
are
wont
to
have
but
two
tenses
we
soon
came
up
to
the
surface
in
one
with
eyes
turned
instinctively
on
the
other
narcissus
bag
seemed
somehow
a
symbol
and
i
had
caught
sight
of
a
binding
or
two
as
it
lay
open
in
tithefields
that
made
me
curious
to
see
it
open
again
he
was
only
beginning
to
collect
when
we
had
parted
at
school
if
is
not
too
sacred
a
word
beginning
to
more
truly
expresses
that
first
glutting
of
the
bookish
hunger
which
like
the
natural
appetite
never
passes
in
some
beyond
the
primary
utilitarian
stage
of
to
live
otherwise
to
read
three
years
however
works
miracles
of
refinement
in
any
hunger
that
is
at
all
capable
of
culture
and
it
was
evident
when
narcissus
did
open
his
that
it
had
taken
him
by
no
means
so
long
to
attain
that
sublimation
of
taste
which
may
be
expressed
as
to
buy
each
volume
had
that
air
of
breeding
one
might
almost
say
by
which
one
can
always
know
a
genuine
at
a
glance
an
alluvial
richness
of
bloom
coming
upon
one
like
an
aromatic
fragrance
in
so
many
old
things
in
old
lawns
in
old
flowers
old
wines
and
many
another
delicious
simile
one
could
not
but
feel
that
each
had
turned
its
golden
brown
just
as
an
apple
reddens
as
indeed
it
had
i
do
not
propose
to
solemnly
enumerate
and
laboriously
describe
these
good
things
because
i
hardly
think
they
would
serve
to
distinguish
narcissus
except
in
respect
of
luck
from
other
bookmen
in
the
first
furor
of
bookish
enthusiasm
they
were
such
volumes
as
pendennis
ran
up
accounts
for
at
oxford
narcissus
had
many
other
points
in
common
with
that
gentleman
such
volumes
as
morning
after
morning
sadden
one
in
that
tantalus
the
catalogue
black
letter
early
printed
first
editions
elizabethan
and
victorian
every
poor
fly
ambered
in
large
paper
etc
etc
in
short
he
ran
through
the
gamut
of
that
craze
which
takes
its
turn
in
due
time
with
marbles
beetles
and
foreign
stamps
with
probably
the
two
exceptions
of
bewick
for
whom
he
could
never
batter
up
an
enthusiasm
and
these
latter
needed
too
much
camphor
he
used
to
say
his
two
most
cherished
possessions
were
a
fine
copy
of
the
printed
by
froben
which
had
once
been
given
by
william
burton
the
historian
to
his
brother
robert
when
the
latter
was
a
youngster
of
twenty
and
a
first
edition
of
one
of
walton
lives
presentation
copy
from
the
author
the
former
was
rich
with
the
autographs
and
marginalia
of
both
brothers
and
on
the
latter
a
friend
of
his
has
already
hung
a
tale
which
may
or
may
not
be
known
to
the
reader
in
the
reverent
handling
of
these
treasures
two
questions
inevitably
forced
themselves
upon
me
where
the
d
l
narcissus
an
apprentice
with
an
allowance
that
would
hardly
keep
most
of
us
in
tobacco
had
found
the
money
for
such
indulgences
and
how
he
could
find
in
his
heart
to
sell
them
again
so
soon
a
sorrowful
interjection
as
he
closed
his
bag
explained
all
he
sighed
have
cost
me
thirty
pounds
and
guess
how
much
i
have
been
offered
for
them
i
suggested
ten
groaned
my
poor
friend
tried
several
to
get
that
h
says
each
one
indifferently
turning
the
most
precious
in
his
hand
this
would
hardly
be
any
use
to
me
and
this
i
might
have
to
keep
months
before
i
could
sell
that
i
could
make
you
an
offer
for
what
have
you
thought
of
for
it
with
a
great
tugging
at
your
heart
and
in
tears
you
name
the
absurdest
minimum
you
had
given
five
you
halve
it
surely
you
can
get
that
but
o
no
i
can
give
nothing
like
that
figure
in
that
case
it
is
no
use
to
talk
of
it
in
despair
you
cry
well
what
will
you
offer
with
a
choking
voice
fifteen
shillings
would
be
about
my
figure
for
it
answers
the
fiend
relentless
as
a
machine
and
so
on
tried
pawning
them
at
first
he
continued
there
was
hope
of
getting
them
back
some
time
that
way
but
trudging
from
shop
to
shop
with
many
prayers
a
sovereign
for
the
lot
was
all
i
could
get
worse
than
concluded
the
frank
creature
for
narcissus
to
be
in
debt
was
nothing
new
he
had
always
been
so
at
school
and
probably
always
will
be
had
you
reproached
him
with
it
in
those
young
days
of
glorious
absurdity
he
would
probably
have
retorted
with
a
toss
of
his
vain
young
head
and
so
was
shelley
i
ventured
to
enquire
the
present
difficulty
that
compelled
him
to
make
sacrifice
of
things
so
dear
to
pay
for
them
of
course
was
the
answer
and
so
i
first
became
initiated
into
the
mad
method
by
which
narcissus
had
such
a
library
about
him
at
from
some
unexplained
reason
largely
i
have
little
doubt
on
account
of
the
charm
of
his
manners
he
had
the
easy
credit
of
those
respectable
booksellers
to
whom
reference
has
been
made
above
no
extravagance
seemed
to
shake
their
confidence
i
remember
calling
upon
them
with
him
one
day
some
months
following
that
afternoon
for
the
madness
as
usual
would
have
its
time
and
no
sufferings
seemed
to
teach
him
prudence
and
he
took
me
up
to
a
certain
set
that
he
had
actually
resisted
he
said
for
a
fortnight
alas
i
knew
what
that
meant
yes
he
must
have
it
it
was
just
the
thing
to
help
him
with
a
something
he
was
writing
to
read
you
know
but
to
make
an
atmosphere
etc
so
he
used
to
talk
and
the
odd
thing
was
that
we
always
took
the
wildness
seriously
he
seemed
to
make
us
see
just
what
he
wanted
say
john
was
the
next
i
heard
at
the
other
end
of
the
shop
you
kindly
send
me
round
that
set
of
charge
it
to
my
account
the
son
of
old
oldbuck
and
for
a
short
time
a
sort
of
friend
of
narcissus
would
answer
with
a
voice
of
the
most
cheerful
trust
and
yet
when
we
had
gone
it
was
indeed
no
less
a
sum
than
which
he
added
to
the
side
of
account
do
not
mistake
this
for
a
certain
vulgar
quality
with
a
vulgar
little
name
of
five
letters
no
one
could
have
less
of
that
than
narcissus
he
was
often
on
the
contrary
quite
painfully
diffident
no
it
was
not
reader
it
was
a
kind
of
irrational
innocence
i
do
think
it
ever
occurred
to
him
till
the
bills
came
in
at
the
what
it
to
my
account
really
meant
perhaps
it
was
because
poor
lad
he
had
so
small
a
practical
acquaintance
with
it
that
he
knew
so
little
the
value
of
money
but
how
he
suffered
when
those
accounts
did
come
in
of
course
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
apply
to
some
friend
denials
of
lunch
and
threadbare
coats
but
nibbled
at
the
amount
especially
as
a
fast
often
found
revulsion
in
a
festival
to
save
was
not
in
narcissus
i
promised
to
digress
reader
and
i
have
kept
my
word
now
to
return
to
that
afternoon
again
it
so
chanced
that
on
that
day
in
the
year
i
happened
to
have
in
my
pocket
what
you
might
meet
me
every
day
in
five
years
without
finding
there
a
note
it
was
for
this
i
felt
after
we
had
been
musing
awhile
narcissus
probably
on
everything
else
in
the
world
except
his
debts
and
it
was
with
this
i
awoke
him
from
his
reverie
he
looked
at
his
hand
and
then
at
me
in
bewilderment
poor
fellow
how
he
wanted
to
keep
it
yet
how
he
tried
to
look
as
if
he
could
think
of
doing
so
he
could
help
his
joy
shining
through
i
want
you
to
take
it
i
said
me
i
have
no
immediate
need
of
it
and
you
can
pay
me
at
your
leisure
ten
pounds
towards
the
keep
of
a
poet
once
in
a
lifetime
is
after
all
but
little
interest
on
the
gold
he
brings
us
at
last
i
shall
i
say
but
on
no
account
without
the
solemnity
of
an
iou
and
a
fixed
date
for
repayment
on
which
matter
poor
was
always
extremely
emphatic
alas
george
meredith
has
already
told
us
how
this
passionate
anxiety
to
be
bound
by
the
heaven
above
the
earth
and
the
waters
under
the
earth
is
the
most
fatal
symptom
by
which
to
know
the
confirmed
in
this
kind
captain
costigan
had
it
it
may
be
remembered
and
the
same
solicitude
the
same
tearful
gratitude
i
know
accompanied
every
such
transaction
of
my
poor
narcissus
whether
it
was
as
apparent
on
the
due
date
or
whether
of
that
ten
pounds
i
have
ever
looked
upon
the
like
again
is
surely
no
affair
of
the
reader
but
lest
he
should
do
my
friend
an
injustice
i
had
better
say
i
have
chapter
iv
accounts
rendered
nothing
strikes
one
more
in
looking
back
either
on
our
own
lives
or
on
those
of
others
than
how
little
we
assimilate
from
the
greatest
experiences
in
nothing
is
nature
apparent
wastefulness
of
means
more
ironically
impressive
a
great
love
comes
and
sets
one
whole
being
singing
like
a
harp
fills
high
heaven
with
rainbows
and
makes
our
dingy
alleys
for
awhile
bright
as
the
streets
of
the
new
jerusalem
and
yet
if
five
years
after
we
seek
for
what
its
incandescence
has
left
us
we
find
maybe
a
newly
helpful
epithet
maybe
a
fancy
at
most
a
sonnet
nothing
strikes
one
more
unless
perhaps
the
obverse
when
we
see
some
trifling
ripple
into
eternity
some
fateful
second
prolific
as
the
fly
aphis
and
so
i
find
it
all
again
exampled
in
these
old
accounts
the
books
that
mean
most
for
narcissus
could
be
carried
in
the
hand
without
a
strap
and
could
probably
be
bought
for
a
sovereign
the
rest
have
survived
as
a
quaint
cadence
in
his
style
have
left
clinging
about
his
thought
a
delicate
incense
of
mysticism
or
are
bound
up
in
the
retrospective
tenderness
of
boyish
loves
long
since
gone
to
dream
another
observation
in
the
same
line
of
reflection
also
must
often
strike
one
for
what
very
different
qualities
than
those
for
which
we
were
first
passionate
do
we
come
afterwards
to
value
our
old
enthusiasms
in
the
day
of
their
bloom
it
was
the
thing
itself
the
craze
the
study
for
its
own
sake
now
it
is
the
discipline
or
any
broad
human
culture
in
which
they
may
have
been
influential
the
boy
chases
the
butterfly
and
thinks
not
of
the
wood
and
the
blue
heaven
but
those
only
does
the
man
remember
for
the
mark
of
their
beauty
upon
him
so
unconsciously
impressed
for
the
health
of
their
power
and
sweetness
still
living
in
his
blood
for
these
does
that
chase
seem
alone
of
worth
when
the
dusty
entomological
relic
thereof
is
in
limbo
and
so
that
long
and
costly
shelf
groaning
beneath
the
weight
of
grose
and
dugdale
and
many
a
mighty
slab
of
topographical
prose
those
pilgrimages
to
remote
parish
churches
with
all
their
attendant
ardours
of
careful
those
notebooks
filled
with
patient
data
those
long
letters
to
brother
antiquaries
of
sixteen
even
that
famous
exshire
tour
itself
which
was
to
have
rivalled
pennant
own
what
remains
to
show
where
this
old
passion
stood
with
all
the
clustering
foliage
of
a
dream
what
but
that
quaint
cadence
i
spoke
of
and
an
anecdote
or
two
which
seemed
but
of
little
import
then
with
such
breathless
business
afoot
as
an
old
font
or
a
roman
road
one
particular
roman
road
i
know
is
but
remembered
now
because
in
the
rich
twilight
of
an
old
june
evening
it
led
up
the
gorsy
stretches
of
lancashire
to
a
solemn
plateau
wide
and
solitary
as
salisbury
plain
from
the
dark
border
of
which
a
warm
human
note
against
the
lonely
infinite
of
heath
and
sky
beamed
the
little
whitewashed
rest
its
yellow
light
growing
stronger
as
the
dusk
deepened
meeting
the
eye
with
a
sense
of
companionship
becoming
a
vague
need
just
then
the
seeming
spiritual
significance
of
such
forlorn
wastes
of
land
had
i
know
a
specially
strong
appeal
for
narcissus
and
in
some
moods
the
challenge
which
they
seem
to
call
from
some
tower
of
spiritual
adventure
would
have
led
him
wandering
there
till
but
a
day
of
rambling
alone
in
a
strange
country
among
unknown
faces
brings
a
social
hunger
by
evening
and
a
craving
for
some
one
to
speak
to
and
a
voice
in
return
becomes
almost
a
fear
a
bright
warm
with
the
health
of
six
workmen
grouped
round
a
game
of
dominoes
and
one
huge
quart
pot
of
ale
used
among
them
as
woman
in
the
early
world
was
a
grateful
inglenook
indeed
wherein
to
close
the
day
of
course
friend
joined
them
and
took
his
pull
and
paid
his
round
like
a
walt
whitman
i
like
to
think
of
his
slight
figure
amongst
them
his
delicate
almost
profile
against
theirs
his
dreamy
eyes
and
pale
brow
surmounted
by
one
of
those
dark
clusters
of
hair
in
which
the
fingers
of
women
love
to
creep
an
incongruity
though
of
surfaces
only
which
certain
who
knew
him
but
sight
as
the
phrase
is
might
be
at
a
loss
to
understand
that
was
one
of
the
surprises
of
his
constitution
nature
had
given
him
the
dainty
and
dreamy
form
of
the
artist
to
which
habit
had
added
a
bookish
touch
ending
in
a
of
gentleness
and
distinction
with
little
apparent
affinity
to
a
scene
like
that
in
the
rest
but
there
are
many
whom
a
suspicion
of
the
dilettante
in
such
an
exterior
belies
and
narcissus
was
one
of
them
he
had
very
strongly
developed
that
instinct
of
manner
to
which
sympathy
is
a
daily
courtesy
and
he
thus
readily
when
it
suited
him
could
take
the
complexion
of
his
company
and
his
capacity
of
was
genius
of
course
all
this
is
but
to
say
that
he
was
a
gentleman
yet
is
not
that
in
itself
a
fine
kind
of
originality
besides
he
had
a
genuine
appetite
for
the
things
of
earth
such
as
many
another
delicate
thing
a
damask
for
example
must
be
convicted
of
too
and
often
when
some
one
has
asked
him
he
could
have
in
common
with
i
have
heard
him
answer
and
beer
samuel
dale
once
described
him
as
shelley
with
a
chin
and
perhaps
the
chin
accounted
for
the
absence
of
any
of
those
sentimental
scruples
with
regard
to
beefsteaks
and
certain
varieties
of
jokes
for
which
the
deserter
of
harriet
westbrook
was
distinguished
a
supremely
quaint
instance
of
this
gift
of
accommodation
befell
during
that
same
holiday
which
should
not
pass
unrecorded
but
which
i
offer
to
the
reader
with
an
emphatic
soit
qui
mal
y
despairing
of
reaching
a
certain
large
manufacturing
town
on
foot
in
time
to
put
up
there
one
evening
he
was
doing
the
last
mile
or
two
by
rail
and
as
the
train
slackened
speed
he
turned
to
his
companions
in
the
carriage
to
enquire
if
they
could
tell
him
of
a
good
hotel
he
had
but
carelessly
noticed
them
before
an
old
man
a
slight
young
woman
of
perhaps
thirty
and
a
girl
about
fifteen
working
people
evidently
but
marked
by
that
air
of
cleanly
poverty
which
in
some
seems
but
a
touch
of
ascetic
refinement
the
young
woman
at
once
mentioned
and
thereupon
a
little
embarrassed
consultation
in
undertone
seemed
to
pass
between
her
and
the
old
man
resulting
in
a
timid
question
as
to
whether
narcissus
would
mind
putting
up
with
them
as
they
were
poor
folk
and
could
well
do
with
any
little
he
cared
to
offer
for
his
accommodation
there
was
something
of
a
sad
winningness
in
the
woman
which
had
predisposed
him
to
the
group
and
without
hesitation
he
at
once
accepted
and
soon
was
walking
with
them
to
their
home
through
streets
echoing
with
lancashire
on
the
way
he
learnt
the
circumstances
of
his
companions
the
young
woman
was
a
widow
and
the
girl
her
daughter
both
worked
through
the
day
at
one
of
the
great
cotton
mills
while
the
old
man
father
and
grandfather
stayed
at
home
and
for
them
thus
they
managed
to
live
in
a
comfort
which
though
straitened
did
not
deny
them
such
an
occasional
holiday
as
had
been
or
the
old
man
the
comfort
of
tobacco
the
home
was
very
small
but
clean
and
sweet
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
all
sat
down
together
over
a
tea
of
wholesome
bread
and
butter
and
eggs
in
the
preparation
of
which
it
seemed
odd
to
see
the
old
man
taking
his
share
that
over
he
and
narcissus
sat
to
smoke
and
talk
of
the
neighbouring
countryside
on
the
for
and
especially
for
any
signs
in
his
companion
of
a
lingering
loyalty
of
belief
in
the
traditions
thereabout
a
loyalty
which
had
something
in
it
of
a
sacred
duty
to
him
in
those
days
those
were
the
days
when
he
still
turned
to
the
east
and
went
out
in
the
early
morning
with
herrick
under
his
arm
to
gather
with
a
great
uplifting
of
the
spirit
in
what
indeed
was
a
very
real
act
of
worship
but
to
my
story
as
bedtime
approached
narcissus
could
not
but
be
aware
of
a
growing
uneasiness
in
the
manner
of
the
young
woman
at
last
it
was
explained
with
blushing
effort
she
stammered
out
the
question
would
he
object
to
share
his
bed
with
the
old
man
course
not
answered
at
once
as
though
he
had
all
the
time
intended
doing
that
very
thing
and
indeed
thought
it
the
most
delightful
arrangement
in
the
world
so
up
to
bed
go
the
oddly
consorted
pair
but
the
delicious
climax
was
yet
to
come
on
entering
the
room
narcissus
found
that
there
were
two
beds
there
why
should
we
leave
that
other
bed
empty
he
had
almost
asked
but
a
laughing
wonder
shot
through
him
and
he
stopped
in
time
the
old
man
was
soon
among
the
blankets
but
narcissus
dallied
over
undressing
looking
at
this
and
that
country
quaintness
on
the
wall
and
then
while
he
was
in
a
state
of
half
man
and
half
trousers
the
voice
of
the
woman
called
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
were
they
in
bed
yet
it
can
not
be
it
is
too
irresistibly
simple
was
his
thought
but
he
had
immediately
answered
a
moment
as
if
such
a
question
was
quite
a
matter
of
course
in
that
space
he
had
blown
the
candle
out
and
was
by
the
old
side
and
then
in
the
darkness
he
heard
the
two
women
ascending
the
stairs
just
outside
his
door
which
he
had
left
ajar
they
seemed
to
turn
off
into
a
small
adjoining
room
from
whence
came
immediately
the
soft
delicious
sounds
of
female
disrobing
they
were
but
factory
women
yet
narcissus
thought
of
saint
agnes
and
madeline
we
may
be
sure
and
then
at
last
indeed
there
was
to
be
no
mistake
about
it
the
door
was
softly
pushed
open
and
two
dim
forms
whispered
across
to
the
adjoining
bed
and
after
a
little
preliminary
rustle
settled
down
to
a
rather
fluttered
breathing
no
one
had
spoken
not
even
a
goodnight
but
narcissus
could
hardly
refrain
from
ringing
out
a
great
mirthful
cry
while
his
heart
beat
strangely
and
the
darkness
seemed
to
ripple
like
sunlight
in
a
cup
with
suppressed
laughter
the
thought
of
the
little
innocent
deception
as
to
their
which
poverty
had
caused
them
to
practise
probably
held
the
breath
of
the
women
while
the
shyness
of
sex
was
a
common
bond
of
silence
at
least
on
the
part
of
the
three
younger
it
was
long
before
narcissus
was
able
to
fall
asleep
for
he
kept
picturing
the
elder
woman
with
burning
cheek
and
open
eyes
in
a
kind
of
fear
beneath
the
coverlet
and
the
oddity
of
the
thing
was
so
original
so
like
some
of
a
or
with
the
wickedness
left
out
but
at
last
wonder
gave
place
to
weariness
and
sleep
began
to
make
a
still
odder
magic
of
the
situation
the
difficulty
of
meeting
at
breakfast
next
morning
which
had
at
once
suggested
itself
to
mind
proved
a
vain
fear
for
when
he
arose
that
other
bed
was
as
smooth
as
though
it
had
lain
untouched
through
the
night
and
the
daughters
of
labour
had
been
gone
two
hours
but
it
was
not
quite
without
sign
that
they
had
gone
for
narcissus
had
a
dreamlike
impression
of
opening
his
eyes
in
the
early
light
to
find
a
sweet
woman
face
leaning
over
him
and
i
am
sure
he
wanted
to
believe
that
it
had
bent
down
still
further
till
it
had
kissed
his
lips
for
his
mother
sake
she
had
said
in
her
heart
as
she
slipped
away
and
was
seen
no
more
this
were
fiction
instead
of
a
veracious
study
from
life
to
make
use
of
a
phrase
which
one
rarely
finds
out
of
a
novel
it
would
be
unfitting
to
let
such
an
incident
as
that
just
related
fall
to
the
ground
except
as
the
seed
of
future
development
but
this
being
as
i
have
stated
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
of
that
winning
narcissus
saw
her
no
more
but
surely
of
all
men
he
could
best
afford
that
one
such
pleasant
chance
should
put
forth
no
other
blossom
save
that
kiss
and
how
can
one
ever
foresee
but
that
our
so
cherishable
spray
of
bloom
may
in
time
add
but
another
branch
to
that
orchard
of
dead
sea
fruit
which
grows
inevitably
about
all
men
dwellings
i
do
not
suppose
that
narcissus
was
really
as
exceptional
in
the
number
and
character
of
his
numerous
boyish
loves
as
we
always
regarded
him
as
being
it
is
no
uncommon
matter
of
course
and
alas
for
a
youth
between
the
ages
of
seventeen
and
nineteen
to
play
the
juggler
at
keeping
three
or
even
female
correspondents
going
at
once
each
of
whom
sleeps
nightly
with
copious
documentary
evidence
of
her
sole
and
incontrovertible
possession
of
the
sacred
heart
nor
has
narcissus
been
the
only
lover
i
suspect
who
in
the
season
of
the
waning
of
the
moon
has
sent
such
excuses
for
scrappy
epistolary
as
strident
din
of
an
office
an
air
so
cruelly
unsympathetic
as
frost
to
buds
to
the
blossoming
of
all
those
words
of
love
that
press
for
birth
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
has
been
unblushingly
eating
the
lotus
in
the
laziest
chair
at
home
in
the
quietest
night
of
summer
such
insincerity
is
a
common
besetting
sin
of
the
young
male
invariably
i
almost
think
if
he
has
the
artistic
temperament
yet
i
do
not
think
it
presents
itself
to
his
mind
in
its
nudity
but
comes
clothed
with
that
sophistry
in
which
youth
the
most
thoroughgoing
of
is
so
ingenious
consideration
for
the
beloved
object
it
is
called
yes
beloved
indeed
though
such
is
the
paradox
in
the
order
of
things
but
one
of
the
several
vestals
of
the
sacred
fire
one
can
not
help
occasional
disinclination
on
a
lazy
evening
confound
it
but
it
makes
one
twinge
to
think
of
paining
her
with
such
a
confession
and
a
story
of
that
sort
well
it
a
lie
of
course
but
it
one
without
any
harm
any
seed
of
potential
ill
in
it
so
the
letter
goes
maybe
to
take
its
place
as
the
of
the
sacred
writings
and
make
poor
daffodilia
who
has
loved
to
count
the
growing
score
happy
with
the
completion
of
the
but
the
disinclination
goes
not
though
the
poor
passion
has
of
course
its
occasional
leapings
in
the
socket
and
the
pain
has
to
come
at
last
for
all
that
dainty
consideration
which
moreover
has
been
all
the
time
feeding
larger
capacities
for
suffering
for
of
course
no
man
thinks
of
marrying
his
twelfth
love
though
in
the
thirteenth
there
is
usually
danger
and
he
who
has
jilted
so
to
say
an
earl
daughter
as
his
sixth
may
come
to
see
god
of
love
ah
benedicite
how
mighty
and
how
great
a
lord
is
in
the
thirteenth
miss
simpkins
but
this
is
to
write
as
an
outsider
for
that
thirteenth
by
a
mystical
process
which
has
given
to
each
of
its
series
in
its
day
the
same
primal
quality
is
of
course
not
only
the
last
but
the
first
and
indeed
with
little
casuistry
that
thirteenth
may
be
truly
held
to
be
the
first
for
it
is
a
fact
determined
not
so
much
by
the
chosen
maid
as
by
him
who
chooses
though
he
himself
is
persuaded
quite
otherwise
to
him
his
amorous
career
has
been
hitherto
an
unsuccessful
pursuit
because
each
followed
fair
in
turn
when
at
length
he
has
caught
her
flying
skirts
and
looked
into
her
face
has
proved
not
that
not
impossible
she
that
shall
command
my
heart
and
me
but
another
to
be
shaken
free
again
in
disappointment
in
truth
however
the
lack
has
been
in
himself
all
this
time
he
had
yet
to
learn
what
loving
indeed
meant
and
he
loves
the
thirteenth
not
because
she
is
beyond
the
rest
but
because
she
has
come
to
him
at
the
moment
when
that
of
loving
has
been
revealed
had
any
of
those
earlier
maidens
fallen
on
the
happy
conjunction
they
would
doubtless
have
proved
no
less
loveworthy
and
seemed
no
less
that
which
they
have
since
become
one
may
be
sure
for
some
other
illuminated
soul
of
course
some
find
that
love
early
the
whom
one
never
marries
and
then
the
faithful
service
probably
it
happens
so
with
the
majority
of
men
for
it
is
i
think
especially
to
the
artist
nature
that
it
comes
thus
late
living
so
vividly
within
the
circle
of
its
own
experience
by
its
very
constitution
so
necessarily
egoistic
the
latter
more
particularly
in
its
early
years
is
always
a
narcissus
caring
for
nought
or
none
except
in
so
much
as
they
reflect
back
its
own
beauty
or
its
own
dreams
the
face
such
a
youth
looks
for
as
he
turns
the
coy
captured
head
to
meet
his
glance
is
quite
unconsciously
his
own
and
the
he
seeks
is
but
the
perfect
mirror
yet
it
is
not
that
mirror
he
marries
after
all
for
when
at
last
he
has
come
to
know
what
that
word
one
so
distasteful
so
to
his
ear
all
ignoble
domesticity
what
that
word
really
expresses
he
has
learnt
too
to
discredit
those
cynical
guides
of
his
youth
who
love
so
well
to
write
ego
as
the
last
word
of
human
nature
but
the
particular
narcissus
of
whom
i
write
was
a
long
way
off
that
thirteenth
maid
in
the
days
of
his
antiquarian
rambles
and
his
ardours
and
the
above
digression
is
at
least
out
of
date
a
copy
of
keats
which
i
have
by
me
as
i
write
is
a
memorial
of
one
of
the
pretty
loves
typical
of
that
period
it
is
marked
all
through
in
black
lead
not
so
gracefully
as
one
would
have
expected
from
the
fingers
which
held
the
pencil
but
rather
it
would
appear
more
with
regard
to
emphasis
than
grace
narcissus
had
lent
it
to
the
queen
of
the
hour
with
special
instructions
to
that
end
so
that
when
it
came
to
him
again
he
might
ravish
his
soul
with
the
hugging
assurance
given
by
the
thick
lead
to
certain
ecstatic
lines
of
such
as
soul
doth
melt
for
the
unhappy
youth
surely
can
not
now
thirst
for
another
love
and
luxuriate
in
a
genial
sense
of
godship
where
the
tremulous
pencil
had
left
the
record
of
a
sigh
against
tender
maiden
whom
he
once
thought
fair
but
it
was
a
magnanimous
godship
and
after
a
moment
leaning
back
with
closed
eyes
to
draw
in
all
the
sweet
incense
how
nobly
would
he
act
in
imaginative
vignette
the
king
cophetua
to
this
poor
suppliant
of
love
with
what
a
generous
waiving
of
his
power
and
with
what
a
grace
did
he
see
himself
raising
her
from
her
knees
and
seating
her
at
his
right
hand
yet
those
alas
mark
but
a
secondary
interest
in
that
volume
a
little
sketch
on
the
another
hand
witness
the
prettier
memory
a
sacred
valley
guarded
by
smooth
green
hills
in
the
midst
a
little
lake
fed
at
one
end
by
a
singing
stream
swallowed
at
the
other
by
the
roaring
darkness
of
a
mill
green
rushes
prosperous
in
the
shallows
and
along
the
other
bank
an
old
hedgerow
a
little
island
in
the
midst
circled
by
silver
lilies
and
in
the
distance
rising
from
out
a
cloud
of
tangled
green
above
the
little
river
an
old
church
tower
below
though
not
the
picture
a
quaint
country
house
surrounded
by
a
garden
of
fair
and
wonderful
bowers
through
which
ran
the
stream
free
once
again
and
singing
for
joy
of
the
light
in
the
great
lone
house
a
solitary
old
man
cherished
and
ruled
by
miller
daughter
was
scene
ever
more
in
need
of
a
fairy
prince
narcissus
sighed
as
he
broke
upon
it
one
rosy
evening
to
think
what
little
meaning
all
its
beauty
had
suffering
that
lack
but
as
he
had
come
thither
with
the
purpose
at
once
firm
and
vague
of
giving
it
a
memory
he
could
afford
to
sigh
till
morning
light
brought
maybe
the
opportunity
of
that
transfiguring
action
he
was
to
spend
an
easter
fortnight
there
as
the
guest
of
some
with
whom
he
had
stayed
years
before
in
a
period
to
which
being
nineteen
he
already
alluded
as
his
and
it
is
not
quite
accurate
to
say
that
it
had
no
memory
for
him
for
he
brought
with
him
one
of
that
very
miller
daughter
though
indeed
it
was
of
the
shadowiest
silver
it
had
chanced
at
that
early
time
that
an
influx
of
visitors
to
the
farm
had
exceeded
the
sleeping
room
and
he
and
another
little
fellow
had
been
provided
with
a
bed
in
the
house
he
had
never
quite
forgotten
that
bedroom
its
huge
slumbrous
with
great
dark
hangings
such
as
queen
elizabeth
seems
always
to
have
slept
in
its
walls
dim
with
tapestry
and
its
screen
of
antique
but
it
was
round
the
toilet
table
that
memory
grew
brightest
for
thereon
was
a
crystal
phial
of
a
most
marvellous
perfume
and
two
great
shells
shedding
a
mystical
radiance
the
most
commonplace
rimmel
without
doubt
and
the
shells
one
may
be
sure
but
to
him
as
he
took
a
reverent
breath
of
that
phial
it
seemed
the
very
sweetbriar
fragrance
of
her
gown
that
caught
his
sense
and
surely
he
never
in
all
the
world
found
scent
like
that
again
thus
long
after
she
would
come
to
him
in
wafted
on
its
strange
sweetness
and
clothed
about
with
that
mystical
lustre
of
pearl
there
were
five
years
between
him
and
that
memory
as
he
stepped
into
that
enchanted
land
for
the
second
time
the
sweet
figure
of
young
womanhood
to
which
he
had
turned
his
boyish
soul
in
hopeless
worship
when
it
should
have
been
busied
rather
with
birds
nests
and
had
it
is
true
come
to
him
in
dimmer
outline
each
spring
but
with
magic
the
deeper
for
that
as
the
form
faded
from
the
silver
halo
and
passed
more
and
more
into
mythology
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
she
had
never
lived
for
him
at
all
save
in
dreams
or
on
another
star
still
his
memory
held
by
those
great
shells
and
he
had
come
at
last
to
the
fabled
country
on
the
perilous
quest
who
of
us
dare
venture
such
a
one
of
a
saint
enquiry
of
his
friends
that
evening
cautious
as
of
one
on
some
diplomacy
told
him
that
one
with
the
name
of
his
remembrance
did
live
at
the
with
an
old
father
too
but
how
all
the
beauty
of
the
singing
morning
became
a
scentless
flower
when
on
making
the
earliest
possible
call
he
was
met
at
the
door
with
that
hollow
word
a
word
that
seemed
to
echo
through
long
rooms
of
infinite
emptiness
and
turn
the
daylight
shabby
till
the
addendum
the
day
set
the
birds
singing
again
and
called
the
sunshine
back
a
few
nights
after
he
was
sitting
at
her
side
by
a
window
with
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
her
head
thrillingly
near
his
with
his
pretty
gift
of
recitation
he
was
pouring
into
her
ear
that
sugared
passage
in
appropriately
beginning
known
unknown
previously
up
for
the
purpose
but
alas
not
too
perfectly
to
prevent
a
though
fortunately
at
a
point
that
admitted
a
ready
turn
to
the
dilemma
let
me
entwine
thee
surer
surer
here
exigency
compelled
to
make
surety
doubly
yea
trebly
sure
but
memory
still
forsaking
him
the
rascal
having
put
deeper
and
deeper
significance
into
his
voice
with
each
repetition
dropped
it
altogether
as
he
drew
her
close
to
him
and
seemed
to
fail
from
the
very
excess
of
love
an
hour
after
he
was
bounding
into
the
moonlight
in
an
intoxication
of
triumph
she
was
won
the
beckoning
wonder
had
come
down
to
him
and
yet
it
was
real
moonlight
was
not
that
his
own
grace
in
silhouette
making
a
mirror
even
of
the
hard
road
real
grass
over
which
he
had
softly
stept
from
her
window
real
trees
all
real
except
yes
was
it
real
love
in
the
lives
of
all
passionate
lovers
of
women
there
are
two
periods
and
in
some
a
third
slavery
lordship
and
service
the
first
is
the
briefest
and
the
third
perhaps
seldom
comes
the
second
is
the
most
familiar
awakening
like
our
forefather
from
the
deep
sleep
of
childish
things
the
boy
finds
a
being
by
his
side
of
a
strange
hushing
fairness
as
though
in
the
night
he
had
opened
his
eyes
and
found
an
angel
by
his
bed
speech
he
has
not
at
all
and
his
glance
dare
not
rise
beyond
her
bosom
till
the
presence
seeming
gracious
he
dares
at
length
stretch
out
his
hand
and
touch
her
gown
whereon
an
inexplicable
new
joy
trembles
through
him
as
though
he
stood
naked
in
a
may
meadow
through
the
golden
rain
of
a
summer
shower
should
her
fingers
touch
his
arm
by
chance
it
is
as
though
they
swept
a
harp
and
a
music
of
piercing
sweetness
runs
with
a
sudden
cry
along
his
blood
but
by
and
by
he
comes
to
learn
that
he
has
made
a
comical
mistake
about
this
wonder
with
his
head
bent
low
in
worship
he
had
not
seen
the
wistfulness
of
her
gaze
on
him
and
one
day
lo
it
is
she
who
presses
close
to
him
with
the
timid
appeal
of
a
fawn
indeed
she
has
all
this
time
been
to
him
as
some
beautiful
woodland
creature
might
have
seemed
breaking
for
the
first
time
upon
the
sight
of
primitive
man
fear
wonder
inexpressible
worship
till
a
sudden
laughing
thought
of
comprehension
then
a
lordly
protectiveness
and
after
that
the
hunt
at
once
the
masculine
returns
and
the
wonder
though
no
less
sweet
in
itself
becomes
but
another
form
of
tribute
with
narcissus
this
evolution
had
taken
place
early
it
was
very
long
ago
he
felt
old
even
then
to
think
of
it
since
hesperus
had
sung
like
a
nightingale
above
his
first
kiss
and
his
memory
counted
many
trophies
of
lordship
but
surely
this
last
was
of
all
the
starriest
perhaps
indeed
so
wonderful
was
it
it
might
prove
the
very
love
which
would
bring
back
again
the
dream
that
had
seemed
lost
for
ever
with
the
passing
of
that
mythical
first
maid
so
long
ago
a
love
in
which
worship
should
be
all
once
more
and
godship
none
at
all
but
is
not
such
a
question
all
too
certainly
its
own
answer
nay
narcissus
if
indeed
you
find
that
again
you
will
not
question
so
you
will
forget
to
watch
that
graceful
shadow
in
the
moonlight
you
will
but
ask
to
sit
by
her
silent
as
of
old
to
follow
her
to
the
end
of
the
world
ah
me
many
queens
have
ruled
and
passed
since
first
we
met
how
thick
and
fast
the
letters
used
to
come
at
first
how
thin
at
last
then
ceased
and
winter
for
a
space
until
another
hand
brought
spring
into
the
land
and
went
the
seasons
pace
that
miller
daughter
although
dear
so
dear
why
of
course
she
was
not
that
maid
but
again
the
silver
halo
has
grown
about
her
again
narcissus
asks
himself
she
live
or
did
i
dream
again
she
comes
to
him
at
whiles
wafted
on
that
strange
incense
and
clothed
about
in
that
mystical
lustre
of
pearl
doubtless
she
lives
in
that
fabled
country
still
but
narcissus
has
grown
sadly
wise
since
then
and
he
goes
on
pilgrimage
no
more
chapter
v
an
idyll
of
alice
sunshine
which
really
belongs
to
the
last
chapter
if
the
reader
has
heard
enough
of
the
amourettes
of
the
young
gentleman
upon
whose
memoirs
i
am
engaged
let
him
skip
this
chapter
and
pass
to
the
graver
chapters
beyond
my
one
aim
is
the
reader
pleasure
and
i
carry
my
solicitude
so
far
that
if
he
finds
his
happiness
to
lie
outside
these
pages
altogether
has
no
choice
among
these
various
chapters
but
prefers
none
to
any
i
am
quite
content
such
a
spirit
of
the
reader
must
admit
is
true
love
perhaps
it
was
an
early
unconscious
of
the
true
love
some
day
to
be
born
in
his
heart
that
caused
narcissus
to
make
a
confession
to
his
miller
daughter
on
one
of
their
pretty
decorative
evenings
when
they
sat
together
at
the
fireside
while
the
scent
of
the
climbing
roses
and
the
light
of
the
climbing
moon
came
in
at
the
window
the
immediate
effect
of
the
confession
was
no
wonder
to
draw
tears
and
how
beautiful
she
looked
in
tears
who
would
dive
for
pearls
when
the
of
a
woman
eyes
are
his
to
rifle
beautiful
beautiful
tears
flow
on
no
dull
leaden
rain
no
mere
monotonous
deluge
but
a
living
singing
fountain
crowned
with
such
rainbows
as
hang
roses
and
stars
in
the
fine
mist
of
samite
waterfalls
irradiated
by
gleaming
shafts
of
lovely
anger
and
scorn
like
northern
lights
on
autumn
evenings
the
maiden
eyes
pierced
narcissus
through
and
through
with
spears
there
was
thunder
too
the
earth
shook
just
a
little
but
soon
narcissus
saw
the
white
dove
of
peace
flying
to
him
through
the
glancing
showers
for
all
her
sorrow
his
was
the
peace
of
confession
his
little
lie
had
been
acknowledged
his
treason
and
it
was
this
i
have
hinted
that
narcissus
like
the
catholic
church
worshipped
many
saints
at
this
time
one
of
them
by
a
thrilling
coincidence
chanced
to
have
her
shrine
at
a
some
fifteen
miles
or
so
from
the
on
whose
banks
the
miller
daughter
had
drawn
into
her
lovely
face
so
much
of
the
beauty
of
the
world
alice
sunshine
shall
we
call
her
was
perhaps
more
of
a
cherub
than
a
saint
a
rosy
laughing
plump
little
arrangement
of
sunshiny
pink
and
white
flesh
with
blue
eyes
and
golden
hair
alice
was
not
overburdened
with
intellectuality
and
like
others
of
her
sex
her
heart
was
nothing
like
so
soft
as
her
bosom
narcissus
had
first
been
in
love
with
her
sister
but
he
and
the
sister
a
budding
woman
of
the
world
had
soon
agreed
that
they
were
not
born
for
each
other
and
narcissus
had
made
the
transfer
of
his
tragic
passion
with
inexpensive
informality
as
the
late
anthony
trollope
would
finish
one
novel
and
begin
another
morning
so
would
narcissus
be
off
with
the
old
love
this
sunday
and
visibly
on
with
the
new
the
next
dear
little
plump
alice
will
narcissus
ever
forget
that
sunday
night
when
the
church
having
at
last
released
its
weary
worshippers
he
stole
not
as
aforetime
to
the
soft
side
of
emily
but
to
the
still
softer
side
of
the
little
bewildered
alice
for
though
alice
had
worshipped
him
all
the
time
and
certainly
during
the
whole
of
the
service
she
had
never
dared
to
hope
that
he
would
pass
her
dashing
sister
to
love
little
blonde
phlegmatic
alice
but
apollo
was
bent
on
the
capture
of
his
daphne
truth
to
say
it
was
but
the
work
of
a
moment
the
golden
arrow
was
in
her
heart
the
wound
kissed
whole
again
and
the
new
heaven
and
the
new
earth
all
arranged
for
in
hardly
longer
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
in
youth
the
mystery
of
woman
is
still
so
fresh
and
new
that
to
make
a
fuss
about
a
particular
woman
seems
like
looking
a
of
the
gods
in
the
mouth
the
light
on
the
face
of
womanhood
in
general
is
so
bewilderingly
beautiful
that
the
young
man
literally
can
not
tell
one
woman
from
another
they
are
all
equally
wonderful
masculine
observation
leads
one
to
suppose
that
woman
first
vision
of
man
similarly
precludes
discrimination
ah
me
it
is
easy
to
laugh
but
it
was
heart
bleeding
tragedy
when
those
powers
that
ought
to
be
decreed
alice
exile
to
a
in
some
central
africa
of
the
midland
counties
the
hemorrhage
of
those
two
young
hearts
but
for
a
time
each
plastered
the
other
wounds
with
letters
dear
letters
letters
every
post
for
the
postal
authorities
made
no
objection
to
narcissus
corresponding
with
two
or
more
maidens
at
once
and
it
is
only
fair
to
alice
to
say
that
she
knew
as
little
of
the
miller
daughter
as
the
miller
daughter
knew
of
her
so
when
narcissus
was
reciting
to
his
miller
maid
it
was
not
without
a
minor
chord
plaining
through
the
major
harmonies
of
the
present
happiness
the
sense
that
alice
was
but
fifteen
miles
away
so
near
she
could
almost
hear
him
if
he
called
only
fifteen
miles
away
and
it
was
a
long
three
months
since
they
had
met
it
now
becomes
necessary
to
admit
a
prosaic
fact
hitherto
concealed
from
the
reader
narcissus
rode
a
bicycle
it
was
i
must
confess
a
rather
thing
to
do
but
surely
the
flashing
airy
wheel
is
the
most
poetical
mode
of
locomotion
yet
invented
and
one
looks
more
like
a
fairy
prince
than
ever
in
knickerbockers
whenever
narcissus
turned
his
gleaming
spokes
along
some
mapped
but
none
the
less
mysterious
county
road
he
thought
of
lohengrin
in
his
barge
drawn
by
white
swans
to
his
mystic
tryst
he
thought
of
the
boots
the
flying
carpet
the
and
the
wooden
pegasus
so
called
because
it
mounted
into
the
clouds
on
the
turning
of
a
peg
as
he
passed
along
by
mead
and
glade
his
wheel
sang
to
him
and
he
sang
to
his
wheel
it
was
a
daisied
daisied
world
there
were
buttercups
and
violets
in
it
too
as
he
sped
along
in
the
early
morning
of
an
unforgotten
easter
sunday
drawn
so
he
had
shamelessly
told
his
miller
daughter
by
antiquarian
passion
to
visit
the
famous
old
parish
church
near
which
alice
was
at
school
antiquarian
passion
well
certainly
it
is
an
antiquarian
passion
now
but
then
how
his
heart
beat
how
his
eyes
shone
as
with
burning
kohl
that
there
was
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
in
this
stolen
ride
never
even
occurred
to
him
and
perhaps
there
was
little
wrong
in
it
after
all
perhaps
when
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
are
revealed
it
will
come
out
that
the
miller
daughter
took
the
opportunity
to
meet
understudy
who
can
tell
but
the
wonderful
fresh
air
was
a
delicious
fact
beyond
dispute
that
was
sincere
ah
there
used
to
be
real
mornings
then
not
merely
interrupted
nights
and
it
was
the
of
romance
there
was
a
sweet
passionate
everywhere
and
and
there
was
even
a
feeling
of
restful
about
the
old
inn
where
at
last
entering
with
much
awe
the
village
where
alice
nightly
slept
clothed
in
white
samite
mystic
wonderful
narcissus
provided
for
the
demands
of
romance
by
a
hearty
country
breakfast
a
manna
of
blessing
seemed
to
lie
thick
upon
every
thing
the
very
ham
and
eggs
seemed
as
if
they
had
been
blessed
by
the
pope
it
was
yet
an
hour
to
an
hour
usually
one
of
spiteful
alacrity
but
this
morning
it
seemed
in
defiance
of
the
clock
cruelly
unpunctual
after
breakfast
narcissus
strolled
about
the
town
and
inquired
the
way
to
miss
curlpaper
school
it
stood
outside
the
little
town
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
in
the
distance
across
billowy
clouds
of
pear
and
making
the
hollow
in
which
the
town
nestled
seem
a
vast
jar
overflowing
with
newly
gathered
had
the
miller
daughter
been
able
to
watch
his
movements
she
would
have
remarked
that
his
antiquarian
ardour
drew
him
not
to
the
church
but
to
a
sombre
house
upon
the
hill
narcissus
reconnoitred
the
edifice
from
behind
a
hedge
then
summoned
courage
to
walk
past
with
slow
nonchalance
all
was
as
dead
and
dull
as
though
alice
was
not
there
yet
somewhere
within
those
her
young
beauty
was
dressing
itself
to
meet
the
spring
perhaps
in
delicious
linen
soft
and
white
she
was
dashing
cool
water
about
her
rosebud
face
or
flushed
with
exhilaration
was
pinning
up
the
golden
fleeces
of
her
hair
perhaps
she
was
eating
wonderful
bacon
and
eggs
could
she
be
thinking
of
him
she
little
knew
how
near
he
was
to
her
he
had
not
written
of
his
coming
letters
at
miss
had
to
pass
an
inspection
much
more
rigorous
than
the
customs
but
still
smuggling
was
not
unknown
for
success
however
carefully
laid
plans
and
regular
dates
were
necessary
and
narcissus
visit
had
fallen
between
the
dates
no
there
was
no
sign
of
her
she
was
as
invisible
as
the
moon
at
and
there
were
the
beginning
to
call
her
alice
put
on
your
things
alice
put
on
your
things
the
birds
are
calling
the
church
bell
rings
the
sun
is
shining
and
i
am
here
waiting
and
waiting
for
you
my
dear
alice
alice
doff
your
gown
of
night
draw
on
your
bodice
as
lilies
white
draw
on
your
petticoats
clasp
your
stays
oh
alice
alice
those
milky
ways
alice
alice
how
long
you
are
the
hour
is
late
and
the
church
is
far
slowly
more
slowly
the
church
bell
rings
alice
alice
put
on
your
things
really
it
was
not
in
narcissus
plans
to
wait
at
the
school
till
alice
appeared
the
misses
curlpaper
were
terrible
unknown
quantities
to
him
for
a
girl
to
have
a
boy
hanging
about
the
premises
was
a
capital
crime
he
knew
boys
are
to
girls
schools
what
anarchists
are
to
public
buildings
they
come
under
the
explosives
acts
it
was
not
indeed
within
the
range
of
his
hope
that
he
might
be
able
to
speak
to
alice
a
look
a
long
immortal
look
was
all
he
had
travelled
fifteen
miles
to
give
and
win
for
that
he
would
have
travelled
fifteen
hundred
his
idea
was
to
sit
right
in
front
of
the
nave
where
alice
could
not
miss
seeing
him
where
others
could
see
him
too
in
his
pretty
suit
of
lincoln
green
so
down
through
the
lanes
he
went
among
the
pear
and
apple
orchards
from
out
whose
blossom
the
clanging
tower
of
the
old
church
jutted
sheer
like
some
bass
rock
amid
rosy
clustering
billows
their
love
had
been
closely
associated
from
its
beginning
with
the
sacred
things
of
the
church
so
regular
had
been
their
attendance
not
only
on
sundays
but
at
services
to
alice
and
narcissus
there
were
two
sabbaths
in
the
week
sunday
and
wednesday
i
suppose
they
were
far
from
being
the
only
young
people
interested
in
their
particular
form
of
leander
met
hero
it
will
be
remembered
on
the
way
to
church
and
the
reader
may
recall
marlowe
beautiful
description
of
her
dress
upon
that
fatal
morning
outside
of
her
garments
were
of
lawn
the
lining
purple
silk
with
gilt
stars
drawn
her
wide
sleeves
green
and
bordered
with
a
grove
where
venus
in
her
naked
glory
strove
to
please
the
careless
and
disdainful
eyes
of
proud
adonis
that
before
her
lies
her
kirtle
blue
whereon
was
many
a
stain
made
with
the
blood
of
wretched
lovers
slain
alice
wore
pretty
dresses
too
if
less
elaborate
and
despite
its
change
of
name
was
not
the
church
where
she
and
narcissus
met
as
the
church
wherein
hero
and
leander
first
looked
upon
each
other
the
temple
of
love
certainly
the
country
church
to
which
narcissus
passed
through
groups
of
villagers
was
decked
as
for
no
christian
festival
this
sabbath
morning
the
garlands
that
twined
about
the
old
norman
columns
the
clumps
of
primroses
and
violets
that
sprung
at
their
feet
as
at
the
roots
of
gigantic
beeches
the
branches
of
palm
and
that
transformed
the
chancel
to
a
bower
probably
for
more
than
knew
it
these
symbols
of
the
joy
and
beauty
of
earth
had
simpler
more
instinctive
meanings
than
those
of
any
arbitrary
creed
for
others
in
the
church
besides
narcissus
no
doubt
they
spoke
of
young
love
the
bloom
and
the
fragrance
thereof
of
mating
birds
and
pairing
men
and
maids
of
the
eternal
principle
of
loveliness
which
in
spite
of
winter
and
of
wrong
brings
flowers
and
faces
to
bless
and
beautify
this
church
of
the
world
as
narcissus
sat
in
his
front
row
his
eyes
drawn
up
in
a
prayer
to
the
painted
glories
of
the
great
east
window
his
whole
soul
lifted
up
on
the
wings
of
colour
scent
and
sound
the
whole
sacred
house
had
but
one
meaning
just
his
love
for
alice
nothing
in
the
world
was
too
holy
to
image
that
the
windows
the
music
the
flowers
all
were
metaphors
of
her
and
as
the
organ
swirled
his
soul
along
in
the
rapids
of
its
passionate
prayerful
sound
it
seemed
to
him
that
alice
and
he
already
stood
at
the
gate
of
heaven
presently
across
his
mingled
sensations
came
a
measured
tramp
as
of
marching
in
line
you
have
heard
it
you
have
for
it
it
was
the
dear
unmistakable
sound
of
a
girls
school
on
the
march
quickly
it
came
nearer
it
was
in
the
porch
it
was
in
the
church
narcissus
gave
a
swift
glance
round
he
dare
not
give
a
real
searching
look
yet
his
heart
beat
too
fast
his
cheek
burned
too
red
but
he
saw
it
was
a
detachment
of
girls
it
certainly
was
school
then
came
the
choristers
and
the
priests
we
say
that
we
have
no
sin
we
deceive
ourselves
and
the
truth
is
not
in
us
but
if
we
confess
our
sins
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all
dearly
beloved
brethren
his
heart
swelled
with
a
sobbing
exaltation
of
worship
such
as
he
had
not
known
for
years
you
could
hardly
have
believed
that
a
little
of
a
pink
and
white
girl
was
the
real
inspirer
of
that
look
in
his
young
face
that
made
old
ladies
even
more
than
young
ones
gaze
at
him
and
remark
afterwards
on
the
strange
boy
with
the
lovely
spiritual
expression
but
all
the
time
narcissus
felt
that
alice
great
eyes
were
on
him
glowing
with
glad
surprise
the
service
proceeded
but
yet
he
forbore
to
seek
her
he
took
a
delight
in
husbanding
his
coming
joy
he
would
not
crudely
snatch
it
it
would
be
all
the
sweeter
for
waiting
and
the
fire
in
alice
eyes
would
all
the
time
be
growing
softer
and
softer
he
nearly
looked
as
he
thought
of
that
and
surely
that
was
her
dear
voice
calling
to
him
in
the
secret
language
of
the
psalm
he
sang
back
to
her
with
a
wild
rapture
thus
the
morning
stars
sang
together
he
thought
and
when
the
prayers
laid
lovely
hands
across
the
eyes
of
the
worshippers
still
he
sought
not
alice
but
prayed
for
her
as
perhaps
only
a
boy
can
o
lord
god
be
good
to
alice
already
she
is
one
of
thy
angels
may
her
life
be
filled
with
light
and
joy
and
if
in
the
time
to
come
i
am
worthy
of
being
ever
by
her
side
may
we
live
our
lives
together
high
and
pure
and
holy
as
always
in
thy
sight
lord
thou
knowest
how
pure
is
my
love
how
i
worship
her
as
i
worship
the
holy
angels
themselves
but
whatsoever
is
imperfect
perfect
by
the
inspiration
of
thy
holy
spirit
so
prayed
the
soul
of
the
boy
for
the
soul
of
the
girl
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
he
prayed
the
cup
of
the
wonder
and
holiness
of
the
world
ran
over
already
it
seemed
that
alice
and
he
lay
clasped
together
in
the
arms
of
god
so
narcissus
prayed
and
sang
his
love
in
terms
of
an
alien
creed
he
sang
of
the
love
of
christ
he
thought
but
of
the
love
of
alice
and
still
he
refrained
from
plucking
that
wonderful
of
her
glance
at
length
he
had
waited
the
whole
service
through
and
with
the
last
hallowed
vibrations
of
the
benediction
he
turned
his
eyes
brimful
of
greedily
eagerly
fearful
lest
one
single
ray
should
be
wasted
on
intermediate
and
irrelevant
worshippers
wonderful
eyes
of
love
but
alas
where
is
their
alice
wildly
they
glance
along
the
rosy
ranks
of
chubby
girlhood
but
where
is
their
alice
and
then
the
ranks
form
in
line
and
once
more
the
sound
the
ecstatic
sound
it
had
seemed
but
a
short
time
before
of
girls
marching
but
no
no
there
is
no
alice
in
sick
despair
narcissus
stalked
that
amazonian
battalion
crouching
behind
hedges
dropping
into
lurking
in
coppices
he
held
his
breath
as
they
passed
two
and
two
within
a
yard
of
him
two
followed
two
but
still
no
alice
narcissus
lay
in
wait
dinnerless
all
that
afternoon
he
walked
about
that
dreary
house
like
a
patrol
till
at
last
he
was
observed
of
the
inmates
and
knots
of
girls
gathered
at
the
windows
alas
only
to
giggle
at
his
forlorn
and
desperate
appearance
still
there
was
no
alice
and
then
it
began
to
rain
and
he
became
aware
how
hungry
he
was
so
he
returned
to
his
inn
with
a
sad
heart
and
all
the
time
poor
little
alice
lay
in
bed
with
a
sore
throat
oblivious
of
those
passionate
boyish
eyes
that
you
would
have
thought
must
have
pierced
the
very
walls
of
her
seclusion
and
after
all
it
was
not
her
voice
narcissus
had
heard
in
the
church
it
was
but
the
still
sweeter
voice
of
his
own
heart
chapter
vi
the
sibylline
books
i
hope
it
will
be
allowed
to
me
that
i
treat
the
reader
with
all
respectful
courtesy
and
that
i
am
well
bred
enough
to
assume
him
familiar
with
all
manner
of
exquisite
experience
though
in
my
heart
i
may
be
no
less
convinced
that
he
has
probably
gone
through
life
with
nothing
worth
calling
experience
whatsoever
it
is
our
jaunty
modern
fashion
and
i
follow
it
so
far
as
i
am
able
i
take
for
granted
for
instance
that
every
man
has
at
one
time
or
another
in
his
salad
days
you
know
before
he
was
embarked
in
his
particular
provision
business
had
foolish
yearnings
towards
poesy
i
respect
the
mythical
dreams
of
his
days
i
assume
that
he
has
been
really
in
love
but
pray
press
me
not
too
curiously
as
to
whether
i
believe
it
all
as
to
whether
i
really
imagine
that
his
youth
knew
other
dreams
than
those
of
the
foolish
young
one
meets
in
the
train
every
morning
or
that
he
has
married
a
wife
for
other
than
purely
reasons
these
matters
i
do
not
mind
leaving
in
the
form
of
a
postulate
let
them
be
granted
but
that
every
man
has
at
one
time
or
another
had
the
craze
for
saving
the
world
i
will
not
assume
narcissus
took
it
very
early
and
though
he
has
been
silent
concerning
his
mission
for
some
time
and
when
last
we
heard
of
it
had
considerably
modified
his
propaganda
he
still
cherishes
it
somewhere
in
secret
i
have
little
doubt
and
one
may
not
be
surprised
one
of
these
days
to
find
it
again
bursting
out
sudden
flame
his
spiritual
experience
has
probably
been
the
deepest
and
keenest
of
his
life
i
do
not
propose
to
trace
his
evolution
from
anabaptism
to
agnosticism
the
steps
of
such
development
are
comparatively
familiar
they
have
been
traced
by
greater
pens
than
mine
the
may
vary
but
the
process
is
uniform
whether
a
man
deserts
the
ancestral
brahminism
that
has
so
long
been
enough
for
his
parents
and
listens
to
the
voice
of
the
buddhist
missionary
or
joins
lucian
in
the
seat
of
the
scornful
shrugging
at
augur
and
philosopher
alike
whether
it
is
voltaire
or
tom
paine
or
thomas
carlyle
or
walt
whitman
or
a
socialist
tract
that
is
the
emancipator
the
emancipation
is
all
one
the
seed
that
is
to
rend
the
rock
comes
in
all
manner
of
odd
and
often
unremembered
ways
but
somehow
it
is
there
rains
and
dews
unnoticed
feed
it
and
surely
one
day
the
rock
is
rent
the
light
is
pouring
in
and
we
are
free
it
is
often
a
matter
of
anguish
that
strive
as
we
may
it
is
impossible
to
remember
what
helping
hand
it
was
that
sowed
for
us
our
fickle
memory
seems
to
convict
us
of
ingratitude
and
yet
we
know
how
far
that
sin
is
from
us
and
how
if
those
sowers
could
but
be
revealed
to
us
we
would
fall
upon
their
necks
or
at
their
feet
i
talked
of
this
one
day
with
narcissus
and
some
time
after
he
sent
me
a
few
notes
headed
pastors
in
which
he
had
striven
to
follow
the
beautiful
example
set
by
marcus
aurelius
in
the
anxiously
loving
acknowledgment
with
which
he
opens
his
meditations
i
know
he
regarded
it
as
miserably
inefficient
but
as
it
does
actually
indicate
some
of
the
more
individual
side
of
his
experience
and
is
moreover
characteristic
in
its
style
i
shall
copy
a
few
passages
from
it
here
some
person
or
persons
unknown
exceeding
gratitude
for
the
suggestion
in
some
dim
talk
antenatal
it
would
almost
seem
that
roman
catholics
might
after
all
be
saved
blessed
fecundating
suggestion
that
was
the
earliest
loophole
my
father
i
owe
a
mind
that
once
set
on
a
clue
must
follow
it
if
need
be
to
the
nethermost
darkness
though
he
has
chosen
to
restrict
the
operation
of
his
own
within
certain
limits
and
to
my
mother
a
natural
leaning
to
the
transcendental
side
of
an
alternative
which
has
saved
me
so
many
a
time
when
reason
had
thrown
me
into
the
abyss
but
one
greatest
debt
to
a
good
mother
must
be
simply
herself
the
rev
father
ignatius
for
his
earnest
preaching
which
might
almost
have
made
me
a
monk
had
not
thomas
carlyle
and
his
especially
the
lecture
on
mahomet
given
me
to
understand
the
true
significance
of
a
messiah
bulwer
for
his
which
first
gave
me
a
hint
of
the
possible
natural
supernatural
and
thus
for
ever
saved
me
from
dogmatising
in
negatives
against
the
transcendental
sir
edwin
arnold
for
his
of
asia
also
to
sinnett
for
his
buddhism
books
which
coming
to
me
about
the
same
time
together
with
some
others
like
them
first
gave
some
occupation
to
an
unchartered
freedom
gained
in
many
forgotten
steps
in
the
form
of
a
faith
which
transfigured
my
life
for
many
months
into
the
most
beautiful
enthusiasm
a
man
could
know
and
which
had
almost
sent
me
to
the
himalayas
it
did
not
quite
achieve
that
though
much
of
the
light
it
gave
me
still
remains
i
owe
to
who
with
no
dialectic
but
with
one
bald
question
and
the
reading
of
one
poem
robbed
me
of
my
fairy
palace
of
oriental
speculation
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
why
it
went
i
have
never
really
quite
known
but
surely
it
was
gone
and
the
wind
and
the
bare
were
alone
in
its
place
i
have
not
seen
you
for
ever
so
long
and
surely
you
have
forgotten
how
that
night
long
ago
you
asked
with
such
a
strange
almost
childlike
simplicity
there
a
soul
but
i
have
not
forgotten
nor
how
i
made
no
answer
at
all
but
only
staggered
and
how
with
your
strange
dreamy
voice
you
chanted
for
comfort
this
hot
hard
flame
with
which
our
bodies
burn
will
make
some
meadow
blaze
with
daffodil
ay
and
those
argent
breasts
of
thine
will
turn
to
the
brown
fields
men
till
will
be
more
fruitful
for
our
love
nothing
is
lost
in
nature
all
things
live
in
death
despite
so
when
men
bury
us
beneath
the
yew
thy
mouth
a
rose
will
be
and
thy
soft
eyes
lush
dimmed
with
dew
and
when
the
white
narcissus
wantonly
kisses
the
wind
its
playmate
some
faint
joy
will
thrill
our
dust
and
we
will
be
again
fond
maid
and
boy
how
my
heart
leaps
up
to
think
of
that
grand
living
after
death
in
beast
and
bird
and
flower
when
this
cup
being
filled
too
full
of
spirit
bursts
for
breath
and
with
the
pale
leaves
of
some
autumn
day
the
soul
earth
earliest
conqueror
becomes
earth
last
great
prey
o
think
of
it
we
shall
inform
ourselves
into
all
sensuous
life
the
faun
the
centaur
or
the
merry
elves
that
leave
they
dancing
rings
to
spite
the
dawn
upon
the
meadows
shall
not
be
more
near
than
you
and
i
to
nature
mysteries
for
we
shall
hear
the
thrush
heart
beat
and
the
daisies
grow
and
the
wan
snowdrop
sighing
for
the
sun
on
sunless
days
in
winter
we
shall
know
by
whom
the
silver
gossamer
is
spun
who
paints
the
diapered
fritillaries
on
what
wide
wings
from
shivering
pine
to
pine
the
eagle
flies
we
shall
be
notes
in
that
great
symphony
whose
cadence
circles
through
the
rhythmic
spheres
and
all
the
live
world
throbbing
heart
shall
be
one
with
our
heart
the
stealthy
creeping
years
have
lost
their
terrors
now
we
shall
not
die
the
universe
itself
shall
be
our
immortality
have
you
forgotten
how
you
chanted
these
and
told
me
they
were
oscar
wilde
you
had
set
my
feet
firmly
on
earth
for
the
first
time
there
was
great
darkness
with
me
for
many
weeks
but
as
it
lifted
the
earth
seemed
greener
than
ever
of
old
the
sunshine
a
goodlier
thing
and
verily
a
blessedness
indeed
to
draw
the
breath
of
life
i
had
learnt
the
value
and
significance
of
flesh
i
no
longer
scorned
a
carnal
diet
and
once
again
i
turned
my
eyes
on
the
damsels
in
the
street
an
influence
soon
came
to
me
that
kept
me
from
going
all
the
way
with
you
and
taught
me
to
say
i
know
not
where
you
would
say
it
is
not
blessings
on
thee
who
didst
throw
a
rainbow
that
may
mean
a
promise
across
the
void
that
awoke
the
old
instinct
of
faith
within
me
and
has
left
me
an
agnostic
with
a
faith
quite
content
with
the
brown
earth
if
that
be
all
but
with
the
added
significance
a
mystery
gives
to
living
thou
who
first
didst
teach
me
love
lore
aright
to
thee
do
i
owe
this
thing
i
owe
the
first
great
knowledge
of
that
other
love
between
man
and
man
which
whitman
has
since
taught
us
to
call
the
dear
love
of
comrades
and
to
him
i
owe
that
i
never
burned
those
early
rhymes
or
broke
my
little
reed
an
unequivocal
service
to
me
whatever
the
public
should
it
be
consulted
may
think
a
dear
sister
i
owe
that
still
more
exquisite
and
subtle
comradeship
which
can
only
exist
between
man
and
woman
but
from
which
the
more
disturbing
elements
of
sex
must
be
absent
and
here
let
me
also
thank
god
that
i
was
brought
up
in
quite
a
garden
of
good
sisters
and
solicitors
and
notaries
i
owe
albeit
i
will
say
no
thanks
to
them
the
opportunity
of
that
hardly
learned
good
which
dwells
for
those
who
can
wrest
it
in
a
hateful
taskwork
that
faculty
of
detachment
which
marcus
aurelius
learnt
so
long
ago
by
means
of
which
the
soul
may
withdraw
into
an
inaccessible
garden
and
sing
while
the
head
bends
above
a
ledger
or
in
other
words
the
faculty
of
dreaming
with
one
side
of
the
brain
while
calculating
with
the
other
browning
great
helped
me
more
to
the
attainment
of
that
than
any
book
i
know
their
office
too
among
many
other
great
things
i
learnt
that
a
man
may
be
a
good
fellow
and
hate
poetry
possibility
undreamed
of
by
sentimental
youth
also
that
bass
and
cope
are
not
unworthy
of
their
great
reputation
and
i
had
various
nonsense
knocked
out
of
me
though
they
never
succeeded
in
persuading
me
in
that
little
matter
of
the
ambrosial
curls
samuel
dale
i
first
came
to
understand
how
whatever
is
be
best
and
also
won
a
faith
in
god
which
i
rather
caught
by
infection
than
gained
by
any
process
of
his
reasoning
of
all
else
i
owe
to
samuel
how
write
he
knows
a
certain
friend
mentioned
last
because
he
is
not
least
i
owe
the
sum
of
ten
pounds
and
a
loving
companionship
up
hill
and
down
dale
for
which
again
i
have
no
words
and
no
sovereigns
when
i
first
read
through
these
i
was
somewhat
surprised
at
the
omission
of
all
reference
to
books
which
i
know
marked
most
striking
periods
in
narcissus
spiritual
life
for
example
pater
the
and
browning
as
i
reflected
however
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
such
omission
was
but
justice
to
his
own
individuality
for
none
of
these
books
had
created
an
in
thought
but
rather
come
as
after
all
i
suppose
they
come
to
most
of
us
as
great
confirming
expressions
of
states
of
mind
at
which
he
had
already
arrived
though
as
it
were
but
by
moonlight
in
them
was
the
sunrise
bringing
all
into
clear
sight
and
sure
knowledge
it
would
seem
indeed
that
the
growth
of
the
soul
in
the
higher
spirits
of
our
race
is
analogous
to
the
growth
of
a
child
in
the
womb
in
this
respect
that
in
each
case
the
whole
gamut
of
earlier
types
is
run
through
before
the
ultimate
form
is
attained
in
which
it
is
decreed
that
the
particular
vital
energy
shall
culminate
and
as
in
the
physical
world
the
various
so
to
say
of
the
progress
are
illustrated
by
the
and
continual
succession
of
those
earlier
types
so
in
the
world
of
mind
at
every
point
of
spiritual
evolution
a
man
may
meet
with
an
historical
individuality
who
is
a
concrete
embodiment
of
the
particular
state
to
which
he
has
just
attained
this
of
course
was
what
goethe
meant
when
he
referred
to
mysticism
as
being
a
frame
of
mind
which
one
could
experience
all
round
and
then
leave
behind
to
quote
whitman
in
another
connection
but
level
that
lift
to
pass
and
continue
beyond
but
an
individuality
must
out
somewhere
and
its
final
value
will
not
so
much
depend
on
the
number
of
states
it
has
passed
through
as
how
it
has
lived
each
on
the
way
with
what
depth
of
conviction
and
force
of
sincerity
for
a
modern
young
man
to
thus
experience
all
round
and
pass
and
continue
beyond
where
such
great
ones
as
bernard
pascal
and
swedenborg
have
anchored
their
starry
souls
to
shine
thence
upon
men
for
all
time
is
no
uncommon
thing
it
is
more
the
rule
than
the
exception
but
one
would
hardly
say
that
in
going
further
they
have
gone
higher
or
ended
greater
the
footpath
of
pioneer
individualism
must
inevitably
become
the
highway
of
the
race
every
american
is
not
a
columbus
there
are
two
ways
in
which
we
may
live
our
spiritual
progress
as
critics
or
poets
most
men
live
theirs
in
that
critical
attitude
which
refuses
to
commit
itself
which
tastes
all
but
enjoys
none
but
the
greatest
in
that
earnest
final
rooted
creative
fashion
which
is
the
way
of
the
poets
the
one
is
as
a
man
who
spends
his
days
passing
from
place
to
place
in
search
of
a
dwelling
to
his
mind
but
dies
at
last
in
an
inn
having
known
nought
of
the
settled
peace
of
a
home
but
the
other
howsoever
often
he
has
to
change
his
quarters
for
howsoever
short
a
time
he
may
remain
in
any
one
of
his
makes
of
each
a
home
with
roots
that
shoot
in
a
night
to
the
foundations
of
the
world
and
blossomed
branches
that
mingle
with
the
stars
criticism
is
a
good
thing
but
poetry
is
a
better
indeed
criticism
properly
not
it
is
but
a
process
to
an
end
we
could
really
do
without
it
much
better
than
we
imagine
for
after
all
the
question
is
not
so
much
we
live
but
we
live
who
would
not
a
hundred
times
rather
be
a
fruitful
parsee
than
a
barren
yes
all
lies
of
course
in
original
greatness
of
soul
and
there
is
really
no
state
of
mind
which
is
not
like
hamlet
pipe
if
we
but
know
the
of
it
will
discourse
most
eloquent
music
now
it
was
that
great
sincerity
in
narcissus
that
has
always
made
us
take
him
so
seriously
and
here
i
would
remark
in
parenthesis
that
trivial
surface
insincerities
such
as
we
have
had
glimpses
of
in
his
dealings
do
not
affect
such
a
great
organic
sincerity
as
i
am
speaking
of
they
are
excrescences
which
the
great
central
health
will
sooner
or
later
clear
away
it
was
because
he
never
held
an
opinion
to
which
he
was
not
when
called
upon
practically
faithful
never
dreamed
a
dream
without
at
once
setting
about
its
translation
into
daylight
never
professed
a
creed
for
a
week
without
some
essay
after
the
realisation
of
its
new
ideal
it
was
because
he
had
the
power
and
the
courage
to
glow
mightily
and
to
some
purpose
because
his
life
had
a
fiery
centre
which
his
eyes
were
not
afraid
of
revealing
that
i
speak
of
his
great
sincerity
a
great
capacity
for
intense
life
shallow
patterers
of
divine
creeds
were
therefore
most
abhorrent
to
him
must
excuse
me
sir
i
remember
his
once
saying
to
such
a
one
what
are
you
doing
with
cigarette
and
salutaris
if
i
held
such
a
belief
as
yours
i
would
stand
sandalled
with
a
rope
round
my
waist
before
one
quaint
instance
of
this
earnest
attitude
in
all
things
occurs
to
me
out
of
his
schooldays
he
was
a
divine
right
man
a
fiery
jacobite
in
those
days
and
probably
not
without
some
absurd
unconfessed
dream
in
his
heart
that
it
might
somehow
help
the
dead
old
cause
he
one
afternoon
fluttered
the
hanoverian
hearts
all
the
men
we
meet
in
street
and
mart
are
hanoverians
of
course
of
our
little
literary
club
by
solemnly
rising
give
notice
that
at
the
following
meeting
he
would
read
a
paper
to
prove
that
house
of
hanover
has
no
right
to
the
english
throne
great
was
the
excitement
through
the
fortnight
intervening
extending
even
to
the
masters
and
the
meeting
was
a
full
one
and
no
little
stormy
narcissus
rose
with
the
air
of
a
condemned
strafford
and
with
all
his
boyish
armoury
of
eloquence
and
scorn
fought
over
again
the
battle
hiss
and
groan
falling
unheeded
into
the
stream
of
his
young
voice
but
vain
vain
hard
is
the
hanoverian
heart
in
boy
as
in
man
and
all
your
glowing
periods
were
in
vain
vain
as
your
peroration
told
us
the
blood
of
gallant
hearts
shed
on
culloden
field
poor
you
had
but
one
timorous
supporter
even
me
so
early
your
but
one
against
so
many
yet
were
you
crestfallen
galileo
with
his
pur
si
muove
disraeli
with
his
time
will
come
wore
such
a
mien
as
yours
as
we
turned
from
that
field
yes
and
you
loved
to
take
in
earnest
vague
hanoverian
threats
of
possible
arrest
for
your
and
for
some
time
i
know
you
never
passed
a
policeman
without
a
dignified
tremor
as
of
one
who
might
at
any
moment
find
a
lodging
in
the
tower
but
the
most
serious
of
all
enthusiasms
was
that
of
which
the
reader
has
already
received
some
hint
in
the
few
paragraphs
of
his
own
confessions
above
that
which
almost
sent
him
to
the
himalayas
it
belongs
to
natures
like
his
always
through
life
to
cherish
a
half
belief
in
their
old
fairy
tales
and
a
longing
however
late
in
the
day
to
prove
them
true
at
last
to
many
such
the
revelations
with
which
madame
blavatsky
as
with
some
mystic
trumpet
startled
the
western
world
some
years
ago
must
have
come
with
most
passionate
appeal
and
to
narcissus
they
came
like
a
love
arisen
from
the
dead
long
before
he
had
full
of
all
the
necromantic
excitements
that
poet
or
romancer
could
give
guy
mannering
had
introduced
him
to
lilly
lytton
and
hawthorne
had
sent
him
searching
in
many
a
musty
folio
for
elixir
vitas
and
the
stone
like
scythrop
in
abbey
he
had
for
a
long
period
slept
with
horrid
mysteries
beneath
his
pillow
but
suddenly
his
interest
had
faded
these
phantoms
fled
before
a
rationalistic
and
eugenius
philalethes
and
robert
fludd
went
with
mejnour
and
zanoni
into
a
twilight
forgetfulness
there
was
no
hand
to
show
the
hidden
way
to
the
land
that
might
be
and
there
were
hands
beckoning
and
voices
calling
him
along
the
highway
to
the
land
that
is
so
passing
he
must
perforce
reconcile
himself
to
daylight
with
its
dusty
beam
and
its
narrow
horizons
judge
then
with
what
a
leaping
heart
he
chanced
on
some
newspaper
gossip
concerning
the
sibyl
for
it
was
so
that
he
first
stumbled
across
her
mission
ironical
indeed
that
the
so
impossible
to
the
mystery
should
come
by
the
hand
of
own
correspondent
but
so
it
was
and
that
paragraph
sold
no
small
quantity
of
literature
for
the
next
twelve
months
sinnett
doorkeeper
in
the
house
of
blavatsky
who
as
a
precaution
against
the
vision
of
bluebeards
that
the
word
oriental
is
apt
to
conjure
up
in
western
minds
is
always
dressed
in
the
latest
mode
and
so
to
say
offers
his
along
with
some
horrid
mystery
it
was
to
his
prospectus
of
the
new
gospel
his
really
delightful
pages
that
narcissus
first
applied
then
he
entered
within
the
gloomier
egyptian
portals
of
the
itself
and
from
thence
well
in
brief
he
went
in
for
a
course
of
redway
and
little
that
figured
in
that
gentleman
thrilling
announcements
was
long
in
reaching
his
hands
at
last
a
day
came
when
his
eye
fell
upon
a
notice
couched
in
suitably
mysterious
terms
to
the
effect
that
really
earnest
seekers
after
divine
truth
might
after
necessary
probation
join
a
brotherhood
of
such
which
it
was
darkly
hinted
could
give
more
than
it
dared
promise
up
to
this
point
narcissus
had
been
indecisive
he
was
remember
quite
in
earnest
and
to
actually
accept
this
new
evangel
meant
to
him
well
as
he
said
nothing
less
in
the
end
than
the
himalayas
pending
his
decision
however
he
had
gradually
developed
a
certain
austerity
and
experimented
in
vegetarianism
and
though
he
was
oddly
enough
free
of
amorous
bond
that
might
have
held
him
to
earth
yet
he
had
grown
to
love
it
rather
rootedly
since
the
earlier
days
when
he
was
a
moreover
though
he
read
much
of
path
no
actual
mejnour
had
yet
been
revealed
to
set
his
feet
therein
but
with
this
paragraph
all
indecision
soon
came
to
an
end
he
felt
there
a
clear
call
to
neglect
which
would
be
to
have
seen
the
light
and
not
to
have
followed
it
ever
for
him
the
most
tragic
error
to
be
made
in
life
his
natural
predisposition
towards
it
was
too
great
for
him
to
do
other
than
trust
this
new
revelation
and
now
he
must
gird
himself
for
sacrifice
which
truth
always
demands
but
sacrifice
of
what
and
for
what
an
undefined
social
warmth
he
was
beginning
to
feel
in
the
world
some
meretricious
ambition
and
a
great
friendship
to
which
in
the
long
run
would
he
not
be
all
the
truer
by
the
great
new
power
he
was
to
win
if
hand
might
no
longer
spring
to
hand
and
friendship
vie
in
little
daily
acts
of
brotherhood
might
he
not
afar
on
his
keep
loving
watch
with
clearer
eyes
upon
the
dear
life
he
had
left
behind
and
be
its
vigilant
fate
surely
and
there
was
nothing
worth
in
life
that
would
not
gain
by
such
a
devotion
all
life
good
was
of
the
spirit
and
to
give
that
a
clearer
shining
even
in
one
soul
must
help
the
rest
for
if
its
light
shining
as
now
through
the
grimy
of
the
body
in
narrow
lanes
and
along
the
miasmatic
flats
of
the
world
even
so
helped
men
how
much
more
must
it
rising
above
that
earthly
fume
in
a
hidden
corner
no
longer
but
in
the
open
heaven
a
star
above
the
city
sacrifice
yes
it
was
just
such
a
tug
as
a
man
in
the
dark
warmth
of
morning
sleep
feels
it
to
leave
the
pillow
the
of
morning
gleam
cold
and
bare
but
o
when
staff
in
hand
he
is
out
amid
the
dew
the
larks
rising
like
fountains
above
him
the
gorse
bright
as
a
golden
fleece
on
the
and
all
the
world
a
shining
singing
vision
what
thought
of
the
lost
warmth
then
what
warmth
were
not
well
lost
for
this
keen
exhilarated
sense
in
every
nerve
in
limb
in
eye
in
brain
what
potion
has
sleep
like
this
crystalline
air
it
almost
takes
one
breath
to
drink
of
such
a
maddening
chastity
is
its
sparkle
what
intoxication
can
she
give
us
for
this
larger
better
rapture
so
did
narcissus
an
old
son
of
the
morning
figure
to
himself
the
struggle
and
pronounce
world
well
lost
but
i
feel
as
i
write
how
little
i
can
give
the
reader
of
all
the
purpose
in
his
eyes
as
he
made
this
resolve
perhaps
i
am
the
less
able
to
do
so
as
let
me
confess
i
also
shared
his
dream
one
could
hardly
come
near
him
without
in
some
measure
doing
that
at
all
times
though
with
me
it
could
only
be
a
dream
for
i
was
not
free
i
had
scriptural
example
to
plead
i
can
not
come
though
in
any
case
i
fear
i
should
have
held
back
for
i
had
no
such
creative
instinct
for
realisation
as
narcissus
and
have
i
fear
dreamed
many
a
dream
i
had
not
the
courage
even
to
think
of
clothing
in
flesh
and
blood
like
may
i
say
the
many
who
are
poets
for
all
save
song
poets
in
chrysalis
all
those
who
dream
of
what
some
do
and
make
the
audience
of
those
great
articulate
ones
but
there
were
one
or
two
trifling
doubts
to
set
at
rest
before
final
decision
the
reader
has
greatly
misconceived
narcissus
if
he
has
deemed
him
one
of
those
simple
souls
whom
any
quack
can
gull
and
the
good
faith
of
this
mysterious
fraternity
was
a
difficult
point
to
settle
a
tentative
application
through
the
address
given
an
appropriate
de
had
introduced
the
ugly
detail
of
preliminary
expenses
divine
truth
has
to
pay
its
postage
its
rent
its
taxes
and
so
on
and
the
feeds
not
on
air
although
of
course
being
a
he
comes
as
near
it
as
the
flesh
will
allow
therefore
and
surely
reader
a
guinea
per
annum
is
after
all
reasonable
enough
suspect
as
much
as
one
will
but
how
gainsay
also
before
the
applicant
could
be
admitted
to
noviciate
even
his
horoscope
must
be
cast
and
well
the
poor
astrologer
also
needed
bread
and
no
not
butter
five
shillings
for
all
his
calculations
circles
and
significations
well
that
again
was
only
reasonable
h
but
it
was
dubious
and
mad
as
we
were
i
do
think
we
ever
got
outside
that
dubiety
but
made
up
our
minds
like
other
converts
to
gulp
the
primary
postulate
and
pay
the
shillings
from
the
first
however
narcissus
had
never
actually
entrusted
all
his
spiritual
venture
in
this
particular
craft
he
saw
the
truth
independent
of
them
not
they
alone
held
her
for
him
though
she
might
hold
them
and
they
might
be
that
one
of
the
many
avenues
for
which
he
had
waited
to
lead
him
nearer
to
her
heart
that
was
all
his
belief
in
the
new
illumination
neither
stood
nor
fell
with
them
though
his
ardour
for
it
culminated
in
the
experience
one
must
take
the
most
doubtful
experiment
seriously
if
we
are
in
earnest
for
results
so
next
came
the
sacred
name
of
order
which
reader
i
can
not
tell
thee
as
i
have
never
known
it
narcissus
being
bound
by
horrid
oaths
to
whisper
it
to
no
man
and
to
burn
at
midnight
the
paper
which
gave
it
to
his
eyes
from
this
time
also
we
could
exchange
no
deep
confidences
of
the
kind
at
all
for
the
various
mss
by
means
of
which
he
was
to
begin
his
excursions
into
urania
and
which
his
sent
from
time
to
time
at
first
it
must
be
admitted
with
a
diligent
frequency
were
secret
too
so
several
months
went
by
and
my
knowledge
of
his
was
confined
to
what
i
could
notice
and
such
trifling
harmless
gossip
as
from
guru
this
morning
an
old
last
night
and
so
on
what
i
could
notice
was
truly
as
lamb
would
say
mastery
for
lo
narcissus
whose
eyes
had
never
missed
a
maiden
since
he
could
walk
and
lay
in
wait
to
wrest
his
tribute
of
glance
and
blush
from
every
one
that
passed
lo
he
had
changed
all
that
and
saint
anthony
in
an
old
master
looks
not
more
resolutely
other
way
than
he
his
very
thoughts
crushing
his
flesh
with
invisible
pincers
no
more
missives
lie
upon
his
desk
and
instead
of
blowing
out
the
candle
to
dream
of
daffodilia
he
opens
his
eyes
in
the
dark
to
defy
the
dweller
on
the
threshold
if
haply
he
should
indeed
already
confront
him
one
thrilling
piece
of
news
in
regard
to
the
latter
he
was
unable
to
conceal
he
read
it
out
to
me
one
flushed
morning
have
seen
him
and
am
his
wrote
the
in
answer
to
his
neophyte
half
fearful
question
fitly
underlined
and
sufficiently
spaced
it
was
a
statement
calculated
to
awe
if
only
by
its
mendacity
i
wonder
if
that
chapter
of
would
impress
one
now
as
it
used
to
do
then
it
were
better
perhaps
not
to
try
the
next
news
of
these
mysteries
was
the
conclusion
of
them
when
so
darkly
esoteric
a
body
begins
to
issue
an
extremely
catchpenny
with
advertisements
of
theosophic
magic
mirrors
and
mesmeric
discs
and
also
advertises
large
copies
of
the
dread
symbol
of
the
order
for
framing
at
five
shillings
plain
and
seven
and
sixpence
coloured
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
take
it
seriously
except
in
view
of
a
process
and
one
is
evidently
in
the
hands
of
very
poor
bunglers
indeed
such
was
the
new
departure
in
propaganda
instituted
by
a
little
magazine
mean
in
appearance
as
the
mouthpieces
of
all
despised
seem
to
be
with
the
first
number
of
which
need
one
say
ended
narcissus
ascent
of
path
i
think
he
was
deeply
sad
at
being
disillusionised
unconsciously
a
broader
philosophy
had
slowly
been
undermining
his
position
and
all
was
ready
for
the
fall
it
cost
no
such
struggle
to
return
to
the
world
as
it
had
taken
to
leave
it
for
the
poet
had
overgrown
the
philosopher
and
the
open
mystery
of
the
common
day
was
already
exercising
an
appeal
beyond
that
of
any
melodramatic
of
course
the
period
left
its
mark
upon
him
but
it
is
most
conspicuous
upon
his
bookshelves
chapter
vii
the
children
of
apollo
is
a
poet
or
is
a
artist
are
phrases
which
irritate
one
day
after
day
in
modern
criticism
one
had
thought
that
and
were
enough
but
there
must
be
a
need
we
regretfully
suppose
for
these
qualifications
and
there
can
be
but
the
one
that
the
false
in
each
kind
do
so
exceedingly
abound
that
none
can
be
taken
as
genuine
without
such
special
certificate
the
widespread
confusion
with
the
poet
of
the
rhetorician
and
sentimentalist
in
verse
and
again
of
the
mere
rhymer
without
even
rhetoric
not
to
refer
to
finer
differentiation
of
error
is
also
a
fruitful
source
of
bewilderment
the
misuse
of
the
word
has
parallels
for
instance
the
spurious
generic
use
of
the
word
for
the
substitution
of
for
but
here
we
have
only
to
deal
with
that
one
particular
abuse
some
rules
how
to
know
a
poet
may
conceivably
be
of
interest
though
of
no
greater
value
of
course
the
one
first
and
last
test
is
his
work
but
to
know
poetry
is
another
matter
which
i
do
not
propose
treating
of
here
my
intention
rather
being
to
dot
down
a
few
personal
characteristics
not
so
much
his
as
his
i
write
as
they
come
into
my
head
and
to
any
reader
about
to
cry
out
against
digression
let
me
add
i
write
thinking
of
narcissus
for
know
all
men
friend
or
philistine
if
you
have
yet
to
learn
it
my
narcissus
is
a
poet
first
as
to
the
great
question
of
the
superstition
that
the
hat
and
the
cloak
it
has
gone
out
in
mockery
but
only
that
the
other
superstition
might
reign
in
its
stead
that
the
hat
and
cloak
can
not
do
it
because
one
great
poet
dispensed
with
and
yet
brought
the
fire
from
heaven
henceforward
are
humbug
and
the
wearer
thereof
but
charlatan
despite
master
yonder
in
the
isle
pegasus
must
pack
in
favour
of
a
british
hunter
and
even
the
poet
at
last
wear
the
smug
regimentals
of
mediocrity
and
mammon
ye
younger
choir
especially
have
a
care
for
though
you
sing
with
the
tongues
of
men
and
angels
and

avail
you
nothing
neither
time
which
is

which
is

know
you

your
verses
remain
till
doom
in
an
ironical
which
not
even
the
foolish
bookman
shall
rescue
from
the
threepenny
box
it
is
very
unlikely
that
you
will
escape
as
did
narcissus
for
though
indeed
swept
a
fine
majestic
sweep
of
toga
tennysonian
wore
strange
soft
hat
that
such
as
you
would
tremble
to
be
known
in
nevertheless
he
somehow
won
happier
fates
on
which
perhaps
it
would
be
unbecoming
in
so
close
a
friend
to
dilate
the
poet
is
first
of
all
a
gentleman
usually
modest
never
arrogant
and
only
assertive
when
pushed
he
does
not
by
instinct
take
himself
seriously
as
the
doth
though
if
he
meets
with
recognition
it
becomes
of
course
his
duty
to
acknowledge
his
faculty
and
make
good
scriptural
use
of
it
he
is
probably
least
confident
however
when
praised
and
never
except
in
rare
moments
especially
of
eclipse
has
he
a
strong
faith
in
the
truth
that
is
in
him
therefore
crush
him
saith
the
philistine
as
we
crush
the
vine
strike
him
as
one
strikes
the
lyre
when
young
he
imagines
the
world
to
be
filled
with
one
ambition
later
on
he
finds
that
so
indeed
it
is
but
the
name
thereof
is
not
poesy
strange
sighs
he
and
if
when
he
is
seventeen
he
writes
a
fluent
song
and
his
admire
it
why
it
is
nothing
surely
the
hath
such
scraps
in
his
poke
or
at
least
can
roll
off
better
bards
believe
all
able
to
achieve
what
they
achieve
said
naddo
but
lo
that
ambition
is
a
word
that
begins
with
pounds
and
ends
with
pence
like
life
quoth
the
who
after
all
had
but
a
tailor
account
and
the
bill
for
his
wife
confinement
in
his
pocket
all
through
his
life
he
loves
his
most
and
no
honey
of
hybla
is
so
sweet
as
a
new
rhyme
let
no
maid
hope
to
rival
it
with
her
lips
she
but
interrupts
for
the
travail
of
a
poet
is
even
as
that
of
his
wife
after
the
pain
comes
that
dear
joy
of
a
new
thing
born
into
the
world
which
doting
sipping
dream
beware
to
break
fifty
repetitions
of
the
new
sweetness
fifty
deliberate
rollings
of
it
under
the
tongue
is
i
understand
the
minimum
duration
of
such
before
the
passion
is
worked
off
and
the
really
breathing
free
of
its
i
have
occasionally
come
upon
narcissus
about
the
i
suppose
and
wondered
at
my
glum
reception
gone
sour
he
once
gave
as
the
reason
try
it
not
reader
if
indeed
in
thy
colony
of
beavers
a
poet
really
dwells
he
is
a
born
palaeontologist
that
is
he
can
build
up
an
epic
from
a
hint
and
despite
modern
instances
the
old
rule
obtains
for
him
he
need
not
be
learned
that
is
not
deeply
or
abundantly
only
at
points
superficially
the
superficial
would
say
well
yes
he
has
an
eye
for
knowing
what
surfaces
mean
the
secret
of
the
divining
rod
take
it
this
way
we
want
an
expression
say
of
the
work
of
keats
want
to
be
told
wherein
lies
his
individuality
you
take
buxton
four
volumes
and
at
keats
and
after
thirty
nights
and
days
bring
your
essay
on
the
morning
of
the
thirtieth
the
poet
read
again
the
and
at
eventide
wrote
a
sonnet
and
on
the
morning
of
the
essay
and
sonnet
are
side
by
side
but
by
the
evening
your
essay
is
in
limbo
or
in
type
all
one
while
the
sonnet
is
singing
in
our
heart
persistently
haunting
our
brain
some
day
the
poet
too
writes
an
essay
and
thus
plainly
shows
says
the
essayist
how
little
he
really
knew
of
the
matter
he
did
actually
know
of
the
and
yet
it
was
his
ignorance
that
gave
us
that
illuminating
line
after
all
i
doubt
if
one
would
be
on
safe
ground
in
saying
take
now
the
subject
of
wine
we
all
know
how
abstemious
is
the
poetical
habit
and
yet
to
read
these
songs
one
would
think
was
bacchus
self
that
wrote
or
that
clarence
who
lay
down
to
die
in
a
butt
of
malmsey
though
the
inference
is
open
to
question
often
wonder
if
old
omar
drank
one
half
the
quantity
he
bragged
in
song
doubtless
he
sat
longest
and
drank
least
of
all
the
topers
of
naishapur
and
the
bell
for
saki
rang
not
from
his
corner
half
often
enough
to
please
mine
host
certainly
the
longevity
of
some
modern
poets
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
some
such
supposition
in
their
case
the
proposition
is
certainly
proved
inversely
in
the
case
of
narcissus
for
he
has
not
written
one
vinous
line
and
yet
well
and
yet
furthermore
it
may
interest
future
biographers
to
know
that
in
his
cups
he
was
wont
to
recite
hamlet
advice
to
the
players
throned
upon
a
the
poet
makes
his
magic
with
the
least
possible
ado
he
and
the
untrue
are
as
the
angler
who
is
born
to
the
angler
who
is
made
at
the
one
encumbers
the
small
of
his
back
with
nameless
engines
talks
much
of
creels
hath
a
rod
like
a
weaver
beam
he
travels
first
class
to
some
distant
among
the
hills
and
he
toils
all
day
as
the
fishermen
of
old
toiled
all
night
while
tom
his
gardener
son
but
a
mile
outside
the
town
with
a
willow
wand
and
a
bent
pin
hath
caught
the
family
supper
so
is
it
with
him
who
is
proverbially
born
not
made
his
friends
say
you
should
go
to
falls
you
write
poetry
there
if
you
like
we
all
said
so
or
are
you
doing
in
here
scribbling
look
through
the
window
at
the
moonlight
there
poetry
for
you
go
out
into
that
if
you
want
sonnets
of
course
he
never
takes
his
friends
advice
he
has
long
known
that
they
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
he
is
probably
quite
ignorant
of
metrical
law
but
one
precept
instinct
taught
him
from
the
beginning
and
he
finds
it
expressed
one
day
in
wordsworth
with
a
blessed
comfort
of
assurance
like
in
this
little
o
may
be
like
somehow
in
the
great
thing
too
is
emotion
remembered
in
tranquillity
the
wandlike
moments
he
remembers
always
came
to
him
in
haunts
all
remote
indeed
from
poetry
a
sudden
touch
at
his
heart
and
the
air
grows
rhythmical
and
seems
with
dreams
and
albeit
in
whatever
room
of
dust
or
must
he
be
the
song
will
find
him
will
throw
her
arms
about
him
so
it
seems
will
close
his
eyes
with
her
sweet
breath
that
he
may
open
them
upon
the
hidden
stars
are
the
quackery
of
the
poetaster
one
may
take
it
for
granted
as
a
general
rule
that
anything
written
the
spot
is
worthless
a
certain
young
poet
who
could
when
he
liked
do
good
things
printed
some
verses
which
he
declared
in
a
were
on
the
top
of
snowdon
in
a
thunderstorm
he
asked
an
opinion
and
one
replied
on
the
top
of
snowdon
in
a
thunderstorm
the
poet
was
naturally
angry
and
yet
what
need
of
further
criticism
the
poet
when
young
although
as
i
said
he
is
not
likely
to
fall
into
the
foolishness
of
conceit
which
belongs
to
the
poetaster
is
yet
too
apt
in
his
zeal
of
dedication
to
talk
much
of
his
or
at
least
think
much
also
to
disparage
life
and
to
pronounce
much
gratuitous
absolution
in
the
name
of
poetry
did
burns
drink
and
wench
yet
he
sang
did
coleridge
opiate
and
neglect
his
family
yet
he
sang
did
shelley
well
whatever
shelley
did
of
callous
and
foolish
the
list
is
long
yet
he
sang
as
years
pass
however
he
grows
out
of
this
stage
and
while
regarding
his
art
in
a
spirit
of
dedication
equally
serious
and
how
much
saner
he
comes
to
realise
that
after
all
art
but
forms
one
integral
part
however
great
of
a
healthy
life
and
that
for
the
greatest
artist
there
are
still
duties
in
life
more
imperative
than
any
art
can
lay
upon
him
it
is
a
great
hour
when
he
rises
up
in
his
resolution
first
to
be
a
man
in
faith
that
if
he
be
such
the
artist
in
him
will
look
after
itself
first
a
man
and
surely
all
the
greater
artist
for
being
that
though
if
not
still
a
man
that
is
the
duty
that
lies
next
to
all
of
us
do
that
and
as
we
are
told
the
other
will
be
clearer
for
us
in
that
hour
that
earlier
form
of
absolution
will
reverse
itself
on
his
lips
into
one
of
commination
did
they
sing
yet
they
sinned
here
and
here
and
as
a
man
soweth
so
shall
he
reap
singer
or
sot
lo
his
songs
are
stars
in
heaven
but
his
sins
are
snakes
in
hell
each
shall
bless
and
torment
him
in
turn
pitiable
indeed
will
seem
to
him
in
that
hour
the
cowardice
that
dares
to
cloak
its
sinning
with
some
theory
that
veils
the
gratification
of
its
desires
in
some
shrill
evangel
and
wrecks
a
woman
life
in
the
names
of
liberty
and
song
art
wants
no
such
followers
her
bravest
work
is
done
by
brave
men
and
not
by
sneaking
and
libidinous
we
all
have
sinned
and
we
all
will
go
on
sinning
but
for
god
sake
let
us
be
honest
about
it
there
are
worse
things
than
honest
sin
if
god
help
you
you
have
ruined
a
girl
do
penance
for
it
through
your
life
pay
your
share
but
do
whatever
you
do
hope
to
make
up
for
a
bad
heart
by
a
good
brain
foolish
may
suffer
the
recompense
to
pass
for
likely
they
have
all
the
one
and
none
of
the
other
but
good
men
will
care
nothing
about
you
or
your
work
so
long
as
bad
trees
refuse
to
bring
forth
good
fruit
or
figs
to
grow
on
thistles
we
have
more
to
learn
from
florentine
artists
than
any
mystery
if
the
capacity
for
using
the
blossom
while
missing
the
evil
fruit
of
which
pater
speaks
in
the
case
of
aurelius
were
only
confined
to
those
trees
alas
it
is
all
blossom
with
us
moderns
good
or
bad
alike
and
purity
or
putrescence
are
all
one
to
us
so
that
they
shine
i
suppose
few
regard
giotto
circle
as
his
greatest
work
would
that
more
did
the
lust
of
the
eye
with
gautier
as
is
too
much
with
us
the
poet
too
who
perhaps
began
with
the
simple
ambition
of
becoming
a
man
soon
finds
how
radically
incapable
of
ever
being
merely
that
he
is
alas
how
soon
the
nimbus
fades
from
the
sacred
name
of
at
one
time
he
had
been
ready
to
fall
down
and
kiss
the
garment
hem
say
of
of
a
editor
this
of
course
when
very
very
young
as
of
a
being
from
another
sphere
and
a
writer
in
had
swam
into
his
ken
trailing
visible
clouds
of
glory
but
by
and
by
he
finds
himself
breathing
with
perfect
composure
in
that
rarefied
air
and
in
course
of
time
the
grey
conviction
settles
upon
him
that
these
fabled
people
are
in
no
wise
different
from
the
booksellers
and
business
men
he
had
found
so
sordid
and
dull
no
more
individual
or
delightful
as
a
race
and
he
speedily
comes
to
the
old
conclusion
he
had
been
at
a
loss
to
understand
a
year
or
two
ago
that
as
a
rule
the
people
who
do
not
write
books
are
infinitely
to
be
preferred
to
the
people
who
do
when
he
finds
exceptions
they
occur
as
they
used
to
do
in
shop
and
office
the
charm
is
all
independent
of
the
calling
for
just
as
surely
as
a
man
need
not
grow
mean
and
hard
and
dried
up
however
prosperous
be
his
so
sure
is
it
that
a
man
will
not
grow
generous
loving
and
all
that
is
golden
by
merely
writing
of
such
virtues
at
so
much
a
column
the
inherent
insincerity
more
or
less
of
all
literary
work
is
a
fact
of
which
he
had
not
thought
i
am
speaking
of
the
mere
the
the
amateur
superstition
not
of
men
of
genius
who
despite
cackle
can
not
disappoint
if
they
seem
to
do
so
it
must
be
that
we
have
not
come
close
enough
to
know
them
but
the
man
of
genius
is
rarer
perhaps
in
the
ranks
of
authorship
than
anywhere
you
are
far
more
likely
to
find
him
on
the
exchange
they
are
as
scarce
as
caxtons
london
possesses
hardly
examples
narcissus
enjoyed
the
delight
of
calling
one
of
these
his
friend
certain
aristocratic
poet
who
loved
all
kinds
of
superiorities
again
to
borrow
from
pater
he
had
once
seen
him
afar
off
and
worshipped
as
it
is
the
blessedness
of
boys
to
be
able
to
worship
but
never
could
he
have
dreamed
in
that
day
of
the
dear
intimacy
that
was
to
come
he
could
but
know
me
as
i
am
he
had
sighed
but
that
was
all
with
the
almost
childlike
naturalness
which
is
his
greatest
charm
he
confessed
this
sigh
long
after
and
won
that
poet
heart
well
i
remember
his
bursting
into
our
london
lodging
late
one
afternoon
and
almost
in
tears
for
joy
of
that
first
visit
he
had
the
capacity
which
most
fine
men
have
of
falling
in
love
with
men
as
one
may
be
sure
of
a
subtle
greatness
in
a
woman
whose
eye
singles
out
a
woman
to
follow
on
the
stage
at
the
theatre
and
certainly
no
other
phrase
can
express
that
state
of
shining
trembling
exaltation
the
passion
of
the
friendships
of
narcissus
and
although
he
was
rich
in
them
rich
that
is
as
one
can
be
said
to
be
rich
in
treasure
so
rare
saving
one
only
they
have
never
proved
that
which
such
do
often
prove
saving
that
one
golden
fruit
still
hangs
for
every
white
cluster
of
wonderful
blossom
thought
you
must
care
for
me
if
you
could
but
know
me
aright
narcissus
had
said
for
you
why
you
beautiful
boy
you
seem
to
have
dropped
from
the
stars
the
poet
had
replied
in
the
caressing
fashion
of
an
elder
brother
he
had
frankly
fallen
in
love
too
for
narcissus
has
told
me
that
his
great
charm
is
a
boyish
naturalness
of
heart
that
ingenuous
gusto
in
living
which
is
one
of
the
sure
witnesses
to
genius
this
is
all
the
more
piquant
because
no
one
would
suspect
it
as
i
suppose
few
do
probably
indeed
a
consensus
would
declare
him
the
last
man
in
london
of
whom
that
is
true
no
one
would
seem
to
take
more
seriously
the
of
modern
paganism
with
its
hundred
gospels
of
no
one
assuredly
were
more
than
he
with
his
languors
of
pose
and
face
of
so
wan
a
flame
the
oscar
wilde
of
modern
legend
were
not
more
as
a
dweller
in
nirvana
but
narcissus
maintained
that
all
this
was
but
a
disguise
which
the
conditions
of
his
life
compelled
him
to
wear
and
in
wearing
which
he
enjoyed
much
subtle
subterranean
merriment
while
underneath
the
real
man
lived
fresh
as
morning
vigorous
as
a
young
sycamore
as
an
eagle
ever
ready
to
flash
out
the
primeval
to
such
as
alone
could
understand
how
else
had
he
at
once
taken
the
stranger
lad
to
his
heart
with
such
a
sunlight
of
welcome
as
the
maid
every
boy
must
have
sighed
for
but
so
rarely
found
who
makes
not
as
if
his
love
were
a
weariness
which
she
endured
and
the
kisses
she
suffered
cold
as
green
buds
were
charities
but
frankly
glows
to
his
avowal
with
love
you
too
dear
jack
and
kisses
him
from
the
first
with
mouth
like
a
june
rose
so
did
that
poet
cast
away
his
conventional
fahrenheit
and
call
narcissus
friend
in
their
first
hour
men
of
genius
alone
know
that
fine
of
soul
in
such
is
the
poet
confessed
as
unmistakably
as
in
his
verse
for
the
one
law
of
his
life
is
that
he
be
an
elemental
and
the
capacity
for
great
simple
impressions
is
the
spring
of
his
power
let
him
beware
of
losing
that
i
sometimes
wonder
as
i
come
across
the
last
frivolous
gossip
concerning
that
poet
in
the
paragraphs
of
the
new
journalism
or
meet
his
name
in
some
distinguished
in
morning
whether
narcissus
was
not
after
all
mistaken
about
him
and
whether
he
could
still
season
after
season
go
through
the
same
stale
round
of
reception
private
view
first
night
and
all
the
various
drill
of
fashion
and
folly
if
that
boy
heart
were
alive
still
one
must
believe
it
once
throbbed
in
him
we
have
his
poems
for
that
and
a
poem
can
not
lie
but
it
is
hard
to
think
that
it
could
still
keep
on
its
young
beating
beneath
such
a
choking
pressure
of
convention
and
in
an
air
so
from
the
healthy
breath
of
morn
but
on
the
other
hand
i
have
almost
a
superstitious
reliance
on
narcissus
intuition
a
faculty
in
him
which
not
i
alone
have
marked
but
which
i
know
was
the
main
secret
of
his
appeal
for
women
they
as
the
natural
possessors
of
the
power
feel
a
singular
kinship
with
a
man
who
also
possesses
it
a
gift
as
rarely
found
among
his
sex
as
that
delicacy
which
largely
depends
on
it
and
which
is
the
other
sure
clue
to
a
woman
love
she
is
so
little
used
poor
flower
to
be
understood
and
to
meet
with
other
regard
than
the
gaze
of
satyrs
however
be
narcissus
intuition
at
fault
or
not
in
the
main
still
it
was
very
sure
that
the
boy
heart
in
that
man
of
the
world
did
wake
from
its
sleep
for
a
while
at
the
wandlike
touch
of
his
youth
and
if
after
all
as
may
be
narcissus
was
but
a
new
sensation
in
his
jaded
round
at
least
he
was
a
healthy
one
nor
did
the
callous
ingratitude
of
forgetfulness
which
follows
so
swiftly
upon
mere
sensation
ever
add
another
to
the
sorrows
of
my
friend
for
during
the
last
week
before
he
left
us
came
a
letter
of
love
and
cheer
in
that
poet
wonderful
handwriting
handwriting
delicious
with
honeyed
lines
each
word
a
flower
each
letter
rounded
with
the
firm
soft
curves
of
hawthorn
in
bud
or
the
delicate
knobs
of
palm
against
the
sky
chapter
viii
george
muncaster
when
i
spoke
of
london
men
of
genius
i
referred
of
course
to
such
as
are
duly
accredited
certificated
so
to
say
by
public
opinion
but
of
those
others
whose
shining
is
under
the
bushel
of
obscurity
few
or
many
how
can
one
affirm
that
there
are
such
any
man
with
any
happy
experience
of
living
should
be
able
to
testify
and
i
should
say
for
fear
of
misunderstanding
that
i
do
not
use
the
word
genius
in
any
technical
sense
not
only
of
men
who
can
in
the
great
triumphal
way
but
also
of
those
who
can
in
their
quiet
effective
fashion
within
their
own
plot
of
ground
men
who
if
ever
conscious
of
it
are
content
with
the
diffusion
of
their
influence
around
the
narrow
limits
of
their
daily
life
content
to
bend
their
creative
instincts
on
the
building
and
beautifying
of
home
it
is
no
lax
use
of
the
word
genius
to
apply
it
to
such
for
unless
you
profess
the
modern
heresy
that
genius
is
but
a
multiplied
talent
a
growth
that
earns
its
right
to
a
new
name
only
when
it
has
lifted
its
head
above
the
waters
of
oblivion
you
must
agree
for
saw
at
once
said
narcissus
in
reference
to
that
poet
his
writing
was
so
delightful
because
he
was
more
so
his
writings
in
fact
were
but
the
accidental
emanations
of
his
personality
he
might
have
given
himself
out
to
us
in
fugues
or
canvases
or
simply
like
the
george
muncaster
of
whom
i
am
thinking
in
the
sweet
breath
and
happy
shining
of
his
home
genius
is
a
personal
quality
and
if
a
man
has
it
whatever
his
hand
touches
will
bear
the
trace
of
his
power
an
undying
odour
an
unfading
radiance
when
rossetti
wrote
like
hers
is
genius
he
was
not
dealing
in
metaphor
and
meissonier
should
have
abolished
for
ever
the
superstition
of
large
canvases
these
desultory
hints
of
the
development
of
narcissus
would
certainly
be
more
incomplete
than
necessity
demands
if
i
did
not
try
to
give
the
reader
some
idea
of
the
man
of
genius
of
this
unobtrusive
type
to
whom
i
have
just
alluded
samuel
dale
used
to
call
himself
artist
in
life
and
there
could
be
no
truer
general
phrase
to
describe
george
muncaster
than
that
his
whole
life
possesses
a
singular
unity
such
as
is
the
most
satisfying
joy
of
a
fine
work
of
art
considering
which
it
never
occurs
to
one
to
think
of
the
limitation
of
conditions
or
material
so
with
his
life
the
shortness
of
man
is
never
felt
one
could
win
no
completer
effect
with
eternity
than
he
with
every
day
hurry
and
false
starts
seem
unknown
in
his
round
and
his
little
home
is
a
microcosm
of
the
golden
age
it
would
even
seem
sometimes
that
he
has
an
artistic
rule
over
his
for
have
a
wonderful
knack
of
falling
into
the
general
plan
of
his
life
as
though
but
waited
for
our
first
meeting
with
him
was
a
singular
instance
of
this
i
say
for
narcissus
and
i
chanced
to
be
walking
a
holiday
together
at
the
time
it
fell
on
this
wise
at
tewkesbury
it
was
we
had
arrived
one
dull
september
evening
just
in
time
to
escape
a
wetting
from
a
grey
drizzle
then
imminent
and
in
no
very
buoyant
spirits
we
turned
into
swan
a
more
dismal
for
a
dismal
evening
could
hardly
be
gloomy
vast
and
thinly
furnished
we
entered
sulkily
seeming
the
only
occupants
of
the
sepulchre
however
there
was
a
small
book
on
the
table
facing
the
door
sufficiently
modern
in
appearance
to
catch
one
eye
and
arouse
a
faint
ripple
of
interest
canterbury
we
cried
a
whitman
more
the
wonder
cried
narcissus
who
had
snatched
it
up
some
one
had
the
sense
too
to
cut
out
the
abominable
portrait
i
wonder
whose
it
is
the
owner
must
evidently
have
some
right
feeling
then
before
there
was
time
for
further
exclamatory
compliment
of
the
unknown
we
were
by
the
turning
round
of
an
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
were
aware
of
a
manly
voice
of
exquisite
quality
asking
you
know
whitman
and
moving
towards
the
speaker
we
were
for
the
first
time
face
to
face
with
the
strong
and
gentle
george
muncaster
who
since
stands
in
our
little
gallery
of
types
as
whitman
camarado
and
divine
husband
made
flesh
i
wish
reader
that
i
could
make
you
see
his
face
but
at
best
i
have
little
faith
in
pen
portraits
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
write
a
graphic
description
of
face
but
when
it
has
been
read
has
the
reader
realised
face
i
doubt
it
and
am
inclined
to
believe
that
three
different
readers
will
carry
away
three
different
impressions
even
from
a
really
brilliant
portrait
laborious
realism
may
at
least
i
think
be
admitted
as
hopeless
the
only
chance
is
in
a
meredithian
and
those
fly
but
from
one
or
two
bows
i
wonder
if
an
image
will
help
at
all
here
think
on
a
pebbly
stream
on
a
brisk
bright
morning
dwell
on
the
soft
shining
lines
of
its
flowing
and
then
recall
the
tonic
influence
the
sensation
of
grip
which
the
pebbles
give
it
dip
your
hand
into
it
again
in
fancy
realise
how
chaste
it
is
and
then
again
think
how
bright
and
good
it
is
and
if
you
realise
these
impressions
as
they
come
to
me
you
will
have
gained
some
idea
of
george
muncaster
face
the
essential
spirit
of
it
i
mean
ever
so
much
more
important
than
the
mere
features
such
at
least
seemed
the
meaning
of
his
face
even
in
the
first
moment
of
our
intercourse
that
september
dusk
and
so
it
has
never
ceased
to
come
upon
us
even
until
now
and
what
a
night
that
was
what
a
talk
how
soon
did
we
find
each
other
out
long
before
the
maid
knocked
at
the
door
and
hinted
by
the
delicate
insinuation
of
a
supposed
ring
that
there
was
budding
morrow
in
the
air
but
our
passionate
generosity
of
soul
was
running
in
too
strong
a
tide
just
then
to
be
stemmed
by
any
such
interference
it
could
but
be
diverted
and
muncaster
bedroom
served
us
as
well
wherein
to
squat
in
one
of
those
close
rapt
circles
of
talk
such
as
i
think
after
all
men
who
love
poetry
can
alone
know
men
anyhow
with
poetry
bed
that
had
for
some
time
been
calling
us
unheeded
as
juliet
nurse
had
at
last
to
be
obeyed
but
how
grudgingly
and
how
eagerly
we
sprang
from
it
at
no
late
hour
in
the
morning
at
the
first
thought
of
the
sweet
new
thing
that
had
come
into
the
world
like
children
who
half
in
a
doze
before
waking
suddenly
remember
last
night
new
wonder
of
a
toy
to
awake
in
an
instant
and
scramble
into
clothes
to
look
at
it
again
thus
like
children
we
rose
but
it
was
shy
as
lovers
we
met
at
the
as
lovers
shy
after
last
night
kissing
you
may
not
have
loved
a
in
this
way
reader
but
we
are
any
one
of
us
as
good
men
as
you
so
keep
your
eyebrows
down
i
beseech
you
one
most
winsome
trait
of
our
new
friend
was
soon
apparent
as
having
to
our
sorrow
to
part
at
the
inn
door
right
and
left
we
talked
of
meeting
again
at
one
or
the
other
home
a
delicate
disinclination
to
irreverently
sure
of
the
new
joy
a
fear
as
though
of
a
presiding
good
spirit
that
might
revoke
his
gift
if
one
stretched
out
towards
it
with
too
greedy
hands
let
us
part
and
say
nought
you
know
where
a
letter
will
find
me
if
our
last
night
was
a
real
thing
we
shall
meet
again
never
fear
with
some
such
words
as
those
it
was
that
he
bade
us
of
course
letters
found
all
three
of
us
before
a
fortnight
had
gone
by
and
in
but
a
short
time
we
found
his
home
there
it
is
that
george
should
be
seen
away
he
is
full
of
precious
light
but
home
is
his
setting
to
narcissus
who
found
it
in
that
green
period
when
all
youngsters
take
vehement
vows
of
celibacy
and
talk
much
of
love
all
ignorant
one
is
in
charity
persuaded
of
what
they
quite
mean
that
home
was
certainly
as
great
and
lasting
a
revelation
as
the
first
hour
of
divine
first
it
was
not
that
his
own
had
been
unhappy
for
it
was
the
reverse
and
rich
indeed
in
great
and
sweet
influences
but
it
was
rather
i
think
that
the
ideal
of
a
home
is
not
so
easily
to
be
reached
from
that
home
in
which
one
is
a
child
where
one
is
too
apt
to
miss
the
whole
in
consideration
of
one
own
part
in
it
as
from
another
on
which
we
can
look
from
the
outside
our
parents
even
to
the
end
partake
too
much
of
the
nature
of
mythology
it
always
needs
an
effort
to
imagine
them
beings
with
quite
the
same
needs
and
dreams
as
ourselves
we
rarely
get
a
glimpse
of
their
poetry
for
the
very
reason
that
we
ourselves
are
factors
in
it
and
are
therefore
too
apt
to
dwell
on
the
less
happy
details
of
the
domestic
life
details
which
one
ray
of
their
poetry
would
transfigure
as
the
sun
transfigures
the
motes
in
his
beam
thus
in
that
green
age
i
spoke
of
one
sickly
vision
can
but
see
the
dusty
side
of
domesticity
the
petty
daily
cares
of
living
the
machinery
so
to
say
of
and
home
but
when
one
stands
in
another
home
where
these
are
necessarily
unseen
by
us
stands
with
the
young
husband
the
how
different
it
all
seems
one
sees
the
creation
bloom
upon
it
one
ceases
to
blaspheme
and
learns
to
bless
later
when
at
length
one
understands
why
it
is
sweeter
to
say
than
how
even
one
may
be
reconciled
to
calling
one
daffodilia
mother
because
of
the
children
you
know
it
would
never
do
for
them
to
say
daffodilia
then
he
will
understand
too
how
those
petty
details
formerly
so
are
after
all
but
notes
in
the
music
and
what
poetry
can
flicker
like
its
own
blue
flame
around
even
the
joint
purchase
of
a
that
narcissus
ever
understood
this
great
old
poetry
he
owes
to
george
muncaster
in
the
very
silence
of
his
home
one
hears
a
singing
lies
the
happiest
land
it
was
one
of
his
own
quaint
touches
that
the
first
night
we
found
his
nest
after
the
maid
had
given
us
admission
there
should
be
no
one
to
welcome
us
into
the
bright
little
parlour
but
a
wee
boy
of
four
standing
in
the
doorway
like
a
robin
that
has
hopped
on
to
one
but
with
what
a
dear
grace
did
the
little
chap
hold
out
his
hand
and
bid
us
good
evening
and
turn
his
little
morsel
of
a
bird
tongue
round
our
names
to
be
backed
at
once
by
a
ring
of
laughter
from
the
hidden
thereupon
revealed
o
happy
happy
home
may
god
for
ever
smile
upon
you
there
should
be
a
special
grace
for
happy
homes
george
set
us
such
with
results
undreamed
of
by
youthful
cynic
take
courage
reader
if
haply
you
stand
with
hesitating
toe
above
the
fatal
plunge
fear
not
you
can
swim
if
you
will
of
course
you
must
take
care
that
your
joint
be
such
a
one
as
george
one
must
not
seem
to
forget
the
loving
wife
who
made
such
dreaming
as
his
possible
he
did
not
and
indeed
had
you
told
him
of
his
happiness
he
would
but
have
turned
to
her
with
a
smile
that
said
of
thee
my
love
while
did
one
ask
of
this
and
that
how
quickly
that
was
george
idea
laughed
along
her
lips
while
we
sat
talking
that
first
evening
there
suddenly
came
three
cries
as
of
three
little
heads
straining
out
of
a
nest
for
and
obedient
with
a
laugh
he
left
us
this
we
soon
learnt
was
a
part
of
the
sweet
evening
ritual
of
home
after
mother
more
practical
service
had
been
rendered
the
little
ones
and
they
were
cosily
in
then
came
turn
which
consisted
of
his
sitting
by
their
bedside
owen
and
geoffrey
on
one
hand
and
little
queen
phyllis
maidenlike
in
solitary
cot
on
the
other
and
crooning
to
them
a
little
evening
song
in
the
dark
too
i
should
say
for
it
was
one
of
his
wise
provisions
that
they
should
be
saved
from
ever
fearing
that
and
that
whenever
they
awoke
to
find
it
round
them
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
should
bring
them
no
other
association
but
voice
a
quaint
recitative
of
his
own
which
he
generally
contrived
to
vary
each
night
was
the
song
a
loving
croon
of
sleep
and
rest
the
brotherhood
of
rest
one
might
name
his
theme
for
folk
as
in
the
morning
we
afterwards
learnt
he
is
wont
to
sing
them
another
little
song
of
the
brotherhood
of
work
the
aim
of
his
whole
beautiful
effort
for
them
being
to
fill
their
hearts
with
a
sense
of
the
brotherhood
of
all
living
things
flowers
butterflies
bees
and
birds
the
the
policeman
the
man
at
the
crossing
the
grocer
pony
all
within
the
circle
of
their
little
lives
as
living
and
working
in
one
great
sometimes
he
would
extemporise
a
little
rhyme
for
them
filling
it
out
with
his
clear
happy
voice
and
that
tender
pantomime
that
comes
so
naturally
to
a
man
who
not
merely
loves
children
for
who
is
there
that
does
not
but
one
born
with
the
instinct
for
intercourse
with
them
to
those
not
so
born
it
is
as
difficult
to
enter
into
the
life
and
prattle
of
birds
i
have
once
or
twice
crept
outside
the
bedroom
door
when
neither
children
nor
george
thought
of
eavesdroppers
and
the
following
little
songs
are
impressions
from
memory
of
his
you
must
imagine
them
chanted
by
a
voice
full
of
the
infinite
tenderness
of
fatherhood
and
even
then
you
will
but
dimly
realise
the
music
they
have
as
he
sings
them
i
run
the
risk
of
his
forgiving
my
printing
them
here
morning
song
morning
comes
to
little
eyes
wakens
birds
and
butterflies
bids
the
flower
uplift
his
head
calls
the
whole
round
world
from
bed
up
jump
geoffrey
up
jump
owen
then
up
jump
phyllis
and
father
going
evening
song
the
sun
is
weary
for
he
ran
so
far
and
fast
the
birds
are
weary
for
who
sang
so
many
songs
as
they
the
bees
and
butterflies
at
last
are
tired
out
for
just
think
too
how
many
gardens
through
the
day
their
little
wings
have
fluttered
through
and
so
as
all
tired
people
do
they
gone
to
lay
their
sleepy
heads
deep
deep
in
warm
and
happy
beds
the
sun
has
shut
his
golden
eye
and
gone
to
sleep
beneath
the
sky
the
birds
and
butterflies
and
bees
have
all
crept
into
flowers
and
trees
and
all
lie
quiet
still
as
mice
till
morning
comes
like
father
voice
so
phyllis
owen
geoffrey
you
must
sleep
away
till
morning
too
close
little
eyes
lie
down
little
heads
and
sleep
sleep
sleep
in
happy
beds
as
the
reader
has
not
been
afflicted
with
a
great
deal
of
verse
in
these
pages
i
shall
also
venture
to
copy
here
another
little
song
which
as
his
brains
have
grown
older
george
has
been
fond
of
singing
to
them
at
bedtime
and
with
which
the
reader
is
not
likely
to
have
enjoyed
a
previous
acquaintance
rest
when
the
sun
and
the
golden
day
hand
in
hand
are
gone
away
at
your
door
shall
sleep
and
night
come
and
knock
in
the
fair
twilight
let
them
in
twin
travellers
blest
each
shall
be
an
honoured
guest
and
give
you
rest
they
shall
tell
of
the
stars
and
moon
and
their
lips
shall
move
to
a
glad
sweet
tune
till
upon
your
cool
white
bed
fall
at
last
your
nodding
head
then
in
dreamland
fair
and
blest
farther
off
than
east
and
west
they
give
you
rest
night
and
sleep
that
goodly
twain
tho
they
go
shall
come
again
when
your
work
and
play
are
done
and
the
sun
and
day
are
gone
hand
in
hand
thro
the
scarlet
west
each
shall
come
an
honoured
guest
and
bring
you
rest
watching
at
your
if
upon
the
eastern
hill
sun
and
day
come
back
no
more
they
shall
lead
you
from
the
door
to
their
kingdom
calm
and
blest
farther
off
than
east
or
west
and
give
you
rest
arriving
down
to
breakfast
earlier
than
expected
next
morning
we
discovered
george
busy
at
some
more
of
his
loving
ingenuity
he
half
blushed
in
his
shy
way
but
went
on
writing
in
this
wise
with
chalk
upon
a
small
blackboard
the
giant
killer
then
in
one
corner
of
the
board
a
sun
was
rising
with
a
merry
face
and
flaming
locks
and
beneath
him
was
written
while
in
the
other
corner
was
a
setting
moon
there
were
other
quaint
matters
too
though
they
have
escaped
my
memory
but
these
hints
are
sufficient
to
indicate
george
morning
occupation
thus
he
endeavoured
to
implant
in
the
young
minds
he
felt
so
sacred
a
trust
an
impression
of
the
full
significance
of
life
in
every
one
of
its
details
the
days
of
the
week
should
mean
for
them
what
they
did
mean
should
come
with
a
veritable
personality
such
as
the
sun
and
the
moon
gained
for
them
by
thus
having
actual
names
like
friends
and
playfellows
this
was
an
especially
great
day
for
them
for
in
the
evening
when
george
had
returned
from
business
and
there
was
yet
an
hour
to
bedtime
they
would
come
round
him
to
hear
one
of
the
adventures
of
the
great
thor
adventures
which
he
had
already
contrived
he
laughingly
told
us
to
go
on
spinning
out
of
the
edda
through
no
less
than
the
thursdays
of
two
years
certainly
his
ingenuity
of
economy
with
his
materials
was
no
little
marvel
and
he
confessed
to
often
being
at
his
wits
end
for
thursday
night
was
not
alone
starred
with
stories
every
night
there
was
one
to
tell
sometimes
an
incident
of
his
day
in
town
which
he
would
dress
up
with
the
imaginative
instinct
of
a
born
teller
of
he
had
a
knack
too
of
spreading
one
story
over
several
days
which
would
be
invaluable
to
a
serial
writer
i
remember
one
simple
instance
of
his
device
he
sat
in
one
of
those
great
cane
nursing
chairs
phyllis
on
one
knee
owen
on
the
other
and
geoffrey
perched
in
the
hollow
space
in
the
back
of
the
chair
leaning
over
his
shoulder
all
as
solemn
as
a
court
awaiting
judgment
george
begins
with
a
preliminary
glance
behind
at
geoffrey
there
my
boy
that
right
well
there
was
once
a
beautiful
garden
go
the
three
solemn
young
heads
it
was
full
of
the
most
wonderful
things
trees
so
green
for
the
birds
to
hide
and
sing
in
and
flowers
so
fair
and
sweet
that
the
bees
said
that
in
all
their
flying
hither
and
thither
they
had
never
yet
found
any
so
full
of
honey
in
all
the
world
and
the
birds
too
what
songs
they
knew
and
the
butterflies
were
there
ever
any
so
bright
and
etc
the
most
wonderful
thing
about
the
garden
was
that
everything
in
it
had
a
wonderful
story
to
tell
birds
and
bees
and
butterflies
even
the
trees
and
flowers
each
knew
a
wonderful
of
all
in
the
garden
the
grasshopper
knew
the
most
he
had
been
a
great
traveller
for
he
had
such
long
legs
again
a
still
deeper
murmur
of
breathless
interest
would
you
like
to
hear
what
the
grasshopper
had
to
tell
you
shall
night
so
off
his
knees
they
went
as
he
rose
with
a
merry
loving
laugh
and
kissed
away
the
long
sighs
of
disappointment
and
sent
them
to
bed
agog
for
all
the
morrow
night
should
reveal
need
one
say
that
the
children
were
not
the
only
disappointed
listeners
besides
they
have
long
since
known
all
the
wonderful
tale
whereas
one
of
the
poorer
still
wonders
wistfully
what
that
grasshopper
who
was
so
great
a
traveller
and
had
such
long
legs
had
to
tell
but
i
had
better
cease
were
i
sure
that
the
reader
was
seeing
what
i
am
seeing
hearing
as
i
i
should
not
fear
but
how
can
i
be
sure
of
that
had
i
the
pen
which
that
same
george
will
persist
in
keeping
for
his
letters
i
should
venture
to
delight
the
reader
with
more
of
his
story
one
underhand
hope
of
mine
however
for
these
poor
hints
is
that
they
may
by
their
very
imperfection
arouse
him
to
give
the
world
true
story
of
a
happy
home
narcissus
repeatedly
threatened
that
if
he
did
not
take
pen
in
hand
he
would
some
day
copy
of
him
and
now
i
have
done
it
instead
moreover
i
shall
further
presume
on
his
forbearance
by
concluding
with
a
quotation
from
one
of
his
letters
that
came
to
me
but
a
few
months
back
know
how
deeply
exercised
the
little
ones
are
on
the
subject
of
death
and
how
i
had
answered
their
curiosity
by
the
story
that
after
death
all
things
turn
into
flowers
well
what
should
startle
the
ears
the
other
day
but
mother
i
wish
you
would
die
o
why
my
dear
because
i
should
so
like
to
water
you
was
the
delicious
explanation
the
theory
has
moreover
been
called
to
stand
at
the
bar
of
experience
for
a
week
or
two
ago
one
of
phyllis
goldfish
died
there
were
tears
at
first
of
course
but
they
suddenly
dried
up
as
geoffrey
in
his
reflective
way
wondered
what
flower
it
would
come
to
here
was
a
dilemma
one
had
never
thought
of
such
contingencies
but
of
course
it
was
soon
solved
what
flower
would
you
like
it
to
be
my
boy
i
asked
a
poppy
he
answered
and
after
consultation
a
poppy
agreed
the
others
so
a
poppy
it
is
to
be
a
visit
to
the
seedsman
procured
the
necessary
surreptitious
poppy
seed
and
so
now
poor
sir
goldfish
sleeps
with
the
seed
of
sleep
in
his
mouth
and
the
children
watch
his
grave
day
by
day
breathless
for
his
resplendent
resurrection
will
you
write
us
an
epitaph
ariel
forgive
me
here
is
what
i
sent
inches
deep
sir
goldfish
lies
here
last
september
was
he
laid
poppies
these
that
were
his
eyes
of
are
these
made
his
fins
of
gold
that
to
and
fro
waved
and
waved
so
long
ago
still
as
petals
wave
and
wave
to
and
fro
above
his
grave
hearken
too
for
so
his
knell
tolls
all
day
each
tiny
bell

original

ix
that
thirteenth

must
give
and
hazard
all
he
hath
of
it
occurs
to
me
here
to
wonder
whether
there
can
be
any
reader
ungrateful
enough
to
ask
with
grumbling
voice
of
the
the
has
been
the
sole
mention
of
them
now
for
many
pages
and
in
the
last
chapter
where
a
book
was
referred
to
the
writer
was
perverse
enough
to
choose
one
that
never
belonged
to
narcissus
at
all
to
which
i
would
venture
to
make
humble
rejoinder
well
goodman
reader
and
what
did
you
expect
was
it
accounts
with
all
their
thrilling
details
with
totals
discount
and
facsimiles
of
the
receipt
stamps
take
another
look
at
our
first
chapter
i
promised
nothing
of
the
sort
there
i
am
sure
i
promised
simply
to
attempt
for
you
the
delineation
of
a
personality
which
has
had
for
all
who
came
into
contact
with
it
enduring
charm
in
hope
that
though
at
you
might
have
some
pleasure
of
it
also
and
i
proposed
to
do
this
mainly
from
the
hints
of
documents
which
really
are
more
significant
than
any
letters
or
other
writings
could
be
for
the
reason
that
they
are
of
necessity
so
unconscious
i
certainly
had
no
intention
of
burdening
you
with
the
original
data
any
more
than
should
you
accept
the
offer
i
made
also
in
that
chapter
and
entrust
me
with
your
private
ledger
for
biographical
purposes
i
would
think
of
printing
it
and
calling
it
a
biography
though
i
should
feel
justified
after
the
varied
story
had
been
deduced
and
written
out
in
calling
the
product
metaphorical
wise
private
ledger
of
johannes
browne
esquire
a
title
which
by
the
way
is
copyright
and
duly
such
was
my
attempt
and
i
maintain
that
i
have
so
far
kept
my
word
because
whole
shelves
have
been
disposed
of
in
a
line
and
a
ninepenny
has
rustled
out
into
pages
you
have
no
right
to
complain
for
that
is
but
the
fashion
of
life
as
i
have
endeavoured
to
show
and
let
me
say
in
passing
that
that
said
copy
of
rhys
whitman
though
it
could
not
manifestly
appear
in
his
does
at
the
present
moment
rest
upon
his
shelf
moment
monument
perhaps
it
would
be
well
before
proceeding
with
this
present
in
the
story
to
set
out
with
a
statement
of
the
various
for
it
as
all
this
being
veritable
history
perhaps
one
should
but
then
reader
here
again
i
should
have
to
catalogue
quite
a
small
library
however
i
will
enumerate
a
few
of
the
more
significant
ones
of
less
all
that
this
great
poem
of
passion
with
its
fire
and
flowers
meant
to
narcissus
and
his
maid
in
the
morning
of
their
love
those
that
have
loved
too
will
hardly
need
telling
while
those
who
have
not
could
never
understand
though
i
spake
with
the
tongue
of
the
poet
himself
in
this
particular
copy
which
i
need
hardly
say
does
not
rest
upon
shelves
but
on
another
in
a
sweet
little
bedchamber
there
is
a
tender
inscription
and
a
sonnet
which
aimed
at
acknowledging
how
the
hearts
of
those
young
lovers
had
gone
out
to
that
poet
mouth
of
gold
and
morning
in
his
eyes
the
latter
i
have
begged
leave
to
copy
here
heart
what
thing
may
symbolise
for
us
a
love
like
ours
what
gift
it
be
hold
more
significance
thee
and
me
than
paltry
words
a
truth
miraculous
or
the
poor
signs
that
in
astronomy
tell
giant
splendours
in
their
gleaming
might
yet
love
would
still
give
such
as
in
delight
to
mock
their
impotence
so
this
for
thee
book
for
thee
our
sweetest
honeycomb
of
lovesome
thought
and
rhyme
builded
of
gold
and
kisses
and
desire
by
that
wild
poet
whom
so
many
a
time
our
hungering
lips
have
blessed
until
a
fire
burnt
speech
up
and
the
wordless
hour
had
come
less
narcissus
was
never
weary
of
reading
those
two
wonderful
chapters
where
lucy
and
richard
meet
and
he
used
to
say
that
some
day
he
would
beg
leave
from
meredith
to
reprint
at
his
own
charges
just
those
two
chapters
to
distribute
to
all
true
lovers
in
the
kingdom
it
would
be
hard
to
say
how
often
he
and
his
maid
had
read
them
aloud
together
with
amorous
punctuation
caresses
for
commas
and
kisses
for
the
less
this
book
they
loved
when
their
love
had
grown
to
have
more
of
earnest
purpose
in
it
and
its
first
hysteric
ecstasy
had
passed
into
the
more
solemn
ardours
of
the
love
that
goes
not
with
spring
but
loves
even
unto
the
winter
and
beyond
it
is
marked
all
through
in
pencil
by
narcissus
but
on
one
page
where
it
opens
easily
there
are
written
initials
in
a
woman
hand
against
this
great
passage
said
thou
shalt
never
unsay
it
and
thy
heart
is
mine
indeed
thou
shalt
bear
thy
love
in
thy
bosom
as
thou
helpest
the
need
thou
shalt
wake
to
it
dawning
by
dawning
thou
shalt
sleep
and
it
shall
not
be
strange
there
is
none
shall
thrust
between
us
till
our
earthly
lives
shall
change
ah
my
love
shall
fare
as
a
banner
in
the
hand
of
thy
renown
in
the
arms
of
thy
fame
accomplished
shall
it
lie
when
we
lay
us
adown
o
deathless
fame
of
sigurd
o
glory
of
my
lord
o
birth
of
the
happy
brynhild
to
the
measureless
reward
so
they
sat
as
the
day
grew
dimmer
and
they
looked
on
days
to
come
and
the
fair
tale
speeding
onward
and
the
glories
of
their
home
and
they
saw
their
crowned
children
and
the
kindred
of
the
kings
and
deeds
in
the
world
arising
and
the
day
of
better
things
all
the
earthly
exaltation
till
their
pomp
of
life
should
be
passed
and
soft
on
the
bosom
of
god
their
love
should
be
laid
at
the
last
and
on
the
page
facing
this
lies
a
pressed
flower
there
used
to
be
two
guarded
by
these
tender
rhymes
shall
read
this
mighty
song
in
some
forthcoming
evensong
we
pray
thee
guard
these
simple
flowers
for
gentle
reader
they
are
ours
but
ill
has
some
reader
attended
to
the
behest
for
as
i
said
but
one
of
the
flowers
remains
one
is
lost
and
narcissus
has
gone
away
this
inscription
is
but
one
of
many
such
scattered
here
and
there
through
his
books
for
he
had
a
great
facility
in
such
minor
graces
as
he
had
a
neat
hand
at
tying
a
bow
i
do
think
he
ever
sent
a
box
of
flowers
without
his
fertility
serving
him
with
some
fancy
to
accompany
them
and
on
birthdays
and
all
days
he
was
always
to
be
counted
upon
for
an
appropriate
rhyme
if
his
art
served
no
other
purpose
his
friend
would
be
grateful
to
him
for
that
alone
for
many
great
days
would
have
gone
without
their
stone
but
for
him
when
for
instance
took
that
brave
plunge
of
his
which
has
since
so
abundantly
justified
him
and
more
than
fulfilled
prophecy
or
when
samuel
dale
took
that
bolder
namely
a
wife
he
being
a
philosopher
incidents
reader
on
which
i
long
so
to
digress
and
for
which
if
you
could
only
know
beforehand
you
would
i
am
sure
give
me
freest
hand
but
beautiful
stories
both
i
may
not
tell
of
you
here
though
if
the
reader
and
i
ever
spend
together
those
hinted
nights
at
the
i
then
may
but
to
return
i
said
above
that
if
i
were
to
enumerate
all
the
books
so
to
say
in
the
love
of
narcissus
and
his
thirteenth
maid
i
should
have
to
catalogue
quite
a
small
library
i
forgot
for
the
moment
what
literal
truth
i
was
writing
for
it
was
indeed
in
quite
a
large
library
that
they
first
met
in
town
there
is
reader
an
institution
which
i
think
you
would
well
like
transported
to
yours
a
quaint
subscription
library
ever
so
long
ago
full
of
wonderful
nooks
and
corners
where
of
course
if
you
are
a
member
one
is
sure
almost
at
any
time
of
the
day
of
a
solitary
corner
for
a
dream
it
is
a
sweet
provision
too
that
it
is
managed
by
ladies
whom
you
may
if
you
can
image
to
yourself
as
the
hesperides
for
there
are
three
of
them
and
may
not
the
innumerable
galleries
and
spiral
staircases
serried
with
countless
shelves
clustered
thick
with
tome
on
tome
figure
the
great
tree
with
its
many
branches
and
its
wonderful
gold
fruit
the
tree
of
knowledge
the
absence
of
the
dragon
from
the
similitude
is
as
well
do
you
think
books
of
all
things
should
be
tended
by
reverent
hands
and
to
my
mind
the
perfunctory
in
things
ecclesiastical
is
hardly
more
distressing
than
the
service
of
books
as
conducted
in
many
great
libraries
one
feels
that
the
should
be
a
sacred
order
nearly
allied
to
the
monastic
refined
by
varying
steps
of
initiation
and
certainly
celibates
they
should
give
out
their
books
as
the
priest
his
sacrament
should
wear
sacred
vestments
and
bear
about
with
them
the
priestlike
as
of
divine
incarnations
of
the
great
spirit
of
truth
and
art
in
whose
temples
they
are
ministrants
the
next
step
to
this
ideal
ministry
is
to
have
our
books
given
out
to
us
by
women
though
they
may
understand
them
not
they
handle
them
with
gentle
courtesy
and
are
certainly
in
every
way
to
be
preferred
to
the
youthful
freckled
monster
with
red
spines
upon
his
head
and
nailed
boots
work
of
the
cyclops
upon
his
feet
whose
physiognomy
is
contorted
by
at
the
very
moment
he
carries
in
his
arms
some
great
or
gentle
what
good
sweet
women
there
are
too
who
would
bless
heaven
for
the
occupation
well
as
i
said
we
in
that
particular
library
are
more
fortunate
and
two
of
the
at
least
did
at
one
time
express
their
appreciation
of
its
privileges
by
a
daily
dream
among
its
shelves
one
day
had
hercules
been
there
overnight
we
missed
one
of
our
fair
attendants
was
it
aegle
arethusa
or
hesperia
narcissus
probably
knew
and
on
the
next
she
was
still
missing
nor
on
the
third
had
she
returned
but
lo
there
was
another
in
her
stead
and
on
her
narcissus
bent
his
gaze
according
to
wont
a
little
maid
with
noticeable
eyes
and
the
hair
rossetti
loved
to
paint
called
hesper
many
said
narcissus
one
day
long
after
solemnly
quoting
the
vita
nuova
know
not
wherefore
do
know
i
asked
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
had
told
me
the
story
i
have
now
to
tell
again
he
had
meanwhile
rather
surprised
me
by
little
touches
of
intimate
observation
of
her
which
he
occasionally
let
slip
as
for
instance
you
noticed
her
forehead
it
has
a
fine
distinction
of
form
is
pure
ivory
surely
and
you
should
watch
how
deliciously
her
hair
springs
out
of
it
like
little
wavy
threads
of
old
gold
set
in
the
ivory
by
some
cunning
artist
i
had
just
looked
at
him
and
wondered
a
moment
but
such
attentive
regard
was
hardly
matter
for
surprise
in
his
case
and
moreover
i
always
tried
to
avoid
the
subject
of
women
with
him
for
it
was
the
one
on
which
alone
there
was
danger
of
our
disagreeing
it
was
the
only
one
in
which
he
seemed
to
show
signs
of
cruelty
in
his
disposition
though
it
was
i
well
know
but
a
thoughtless
cruelty
and
in
my
heart
i
always
felt
that
he
was
too
and
noble
in
the
other
great
matters
of
life
not
to
come
right
on
that
too
when
hour
had
struck
meanwhile
he
had
a
way
of
classifying
amours
by
the
number
of
verses
inspired
as
it
all
over
but
never
mind
i
got
two
sonnets
out
of
her
which
seemed
to
me
an
exhibition
of
the
worst
side
of
his
artist
disposition
and
which
well
reader
jarred
much
on
one
who
already
knew
what
a
true
love
meant
it
was
however
i
could
see
quite
unconscious
and
i
tried
hard
not
to
be
intolerant
towards
him
because
fortune
had
blessed
me
with
an
earlier
illumination
pray
go
not
away
with
the
misconception
that
narcissus
was
ever
base
to
a
woman
no
he
left
that
to
circe
hogs
and
the
one
temptation
he
ever
had
towards
it
he
turned
into
a
shining
salvation
no
he
had
nothing
worse
than
the
sins
of
the
young
egoist
to
answer
for
though
he
afterwards
came
to
feel
those
pitiful
and
mean
enough
another
noticeable
feature
of
hesper
face
was
an
sadness
not
as
of
a
dull
grief
but
as
of
some
shining
sorrow
a
quality
which
gave
her
face
much
arresting
interest
it
seemed
one
great
rich
tear
one
loved
to
dwell
upon
it
as
upon
those
intense
stretches
of
evening
sky
when
the
day
yearns
through
eyelids
in
the
west
one
continually
wondered
what
story
it
meant
for
some
it
must
mean
watching
her
thus
quietly
day
by
day
it
seemed
to
me
that
as
the
weeks
from
her
first
coming
went
by
this
sadness
deepened
and
i
could
not
forbear
one
day
questioning
the
elder
hesperides
about
her
thus
bringing
upon
myself
a
revelation
i
had
little
expected
for
said
she
was
glad
i
had
spoken
to
her
for
she
had
long
wished
to
ask
me
to
use
my
influence
with
my
friend
that
he
might
cease
paying
hesper
attentions
which
he
could
not
mean
in
earnest
but
which
she
knew
were
already
causing
hesper
to
be
fond
of
him
having
become
friendly
with
her
she
had
found
out
her
secret
and
remonstrated
with
her
with
the
result
that
she
had
avoided
narcissus
for
some
time
but
not
without
much
misery
to
herself
over
which
she
was
continually
brooding
all
this
was
an
utter
surprise
and
a
saddening
one
for
i
had
grown
to
feel
much
interest
in
the
girl
and
had
been
especially
pleased
by
all
absence
of
the
flighty
tendencies
with
which
too
many
girls
in
public
service
tempt
men
to
their
own
destruction
she
had
seemed
to
me
to
bear
herself
with
a
maidenly
that
spoke
of
no
little
grace
of
breeding
she
had
two
very
strong
claims
on
one
regard
she
was
evidently
a
woman
in
the
deep
tragic
sense
of
that
word
and
a
lady
in
the
only
true
sense
of
that
the
thought
of
a
life
so
rich
in
womanly
promise
becoming
but
another
of
the
idle
playthings
of
narcissus
filled
me
with
something
akin
to
rage
and
i
was
not
long
in
saying
some
strong
words
to
him
not
that
i
feared
for
her
the
coarse
the
world
alone
thinks
of
is
that
the
worst
that
can
befall
woman
what
of
the
spiritual
deflowering
of
which
the
bodily
is
but
a
symbol
if
the
first
fine
bloom
of
the
soul
has
gone
if
the
dream
that
is
only
dreamed
once
has
grown
up
in
the
imagination
and
been
once
given
the
mere
chastity
of
the
body
is
a
lie
and
whatever
its
fecundity
the
soul
has
nought
but
sterility
to
give
to
another
it
is
not
those
kisses
of
the
lips
kisses
that
one
forgets
as
one
forgets
the
roses
we
smelt
last
year
which
profane
they
but
soil
the
vessel
of
the
sacrament
and
it
is
the
sacrament
itself
which
those
consuming
which
burn
but
through
the
eyes
may
desecrate
it
is
strange
that
man
should
have
so
long
taken
the
precisely
opposite
attitude
in
this
matter
caring
only
for
the
observation
of
the
vessel
and
apparently
dreaming
not
of
any
other
possible
approach
to
the
sanctities
probably
however
his
care
has
not
been
of
sanctities
at
all
indeed
most
have
doubtless
little
suspicion
of
the
existence
of
such
and
the
symbol
has
been
and
is
but
a
selfish
superstition
amongst
them
woman
a
symbol
whose
meaning
is
forgotten
but
still
the
object
of
an
ignorant
veneration
not
unrelated
to
the
preservation
of
game
narcissus
took
my
remonstrance
a
little
flippantly
i
thought
evidently
feeling
that
too
much
had
been
made
out
of
very
little
for
he
averred
that
his
to
hesper
had
been
of
the
slightest
character
hardly
more
than
occasional
looks
and
whispers
which
from
her
cold
reception
of
them
he
had
felt
were
more
distasteful
to
her
than
otherwise
he
had
indeed
he
said
ceased
even
these
the
last
few
days
as
her
reserve
always
made
him
feel
foolish
as
a
man
fondling
a
fair
face
in
his
dream
wakes
on
a
sudden
to
find
that
he
is
but
grimacing
at
the
air
this
reassured
me
and
i
felt
little
further
anxiety
however
this
security
only
proved
how
little
i
really
understood
the
weak
side
of
my
friend
i
had
not
realised
how
much
he
really
was
narcissus
and
how
dear
to
him
was
a
new
mirror
my
speaking
to
him
was
the
one
wrong
course
possible
to
be
taken
instead
of
confirming
his
growing
intention
of
indifference
it
had
as
might
have
been
foreseen
the
directly
opposite
effect
and
from
the
moment
of
his
learning
that
hesper
secretly
loved
him
she
at
once
became
invested
with
a
new
glamour
and
grew
daily
more
and
more
the
forbidden
fascination
few
can
resist
i
did
not
learn
this
for
many
months
meanwhile
narcissus
chose
to
deceive
me
for
the
first
and
only
time
at
last
he
told
me
all
and
how
different
was
his
manner
of
telling
it
from
his
former
gay
relations
of
conquest
one
needed
not
to
hear
the
words
to
see
he
was
unveiling
a
sacred
thing
a
holiness
so
white
and
hidden
the
most
reverent
word
seemed
a
profanation
and
as
he
laboured
for
the
least
soiled
wherein
to
enfold
the
revelation
his
soul
seemed
as
a
maid
torn
with
the
blushing
tremors
of
a
new
knowledge
men
only
speak
so
after
great
and
wonderful
travail
and
by
that
token
i
knew
narcissus
loved
at
last
it
had
seemed
unlikely
ground
from
which
love
had
first
sprung
forth
that
of
a
that
could
forgo
no
slightest
indulgence
but
thence
indeed
it
had
come
the
silent
service
my
words
had
given
him
to
know
that
hesper
heart
was
offering
to
him
was
not
enough
he
must
hear
it
articulate
his
nostrils
craved
an
actual
incense
to
gain
this
he
must
deceive
two
his
friend
and
her
whose
poor
face
would
kindle
with
hectic
hope
at
the
false
words
he
must
say
for
the
true
words
he
hear
it
was
pitifully
mean
but
whom
has
not
his
own
hidden
lust
made
to
crawl
like
a
thief
afraid
of
a
shadow
in
his
own
house
young
lust
was
himself
and
moloch
knew
no
more
ruthless
hunger
than
burns
in
such
of
course
it
did
not
present
itself
quite
nakedly
to
him
he
persuaded
himself
there
could
be
little
harm
he
meant
none
and
so
instead
of
avoiding
hesper
he
sought
her
the
more
persistently
and
by
some
means
so
far
wooed
her
from
her
reticence
as
to
win
her
consent
to
a
walk
together
one
autumn
afternoon
how
little
do
we
know
the
measure
of
our
own
proposing
that
walk
was
to
be
the
most
fateful
his
feet
had
ever
trodden
through
field
and
wood
yet
it
seemed
the
most
accidental
of
gallantries
a
little
with
a
romantic
passion
for
it
would
be
interesting
to
watch
the
child
it
would
be
like
giving
her
a
day
holiday
so
much
sunshine
our
presence
and
so
on
but
what
an
entirely
different
complexion
was
the
whole
thing
beginning
to
take
before
they
had
walked
a
mile
behind
the
flippancy
one
had
gone
to
meet
were
surely
the
growing
features
of
a
solemnity
why
the
child
was
a
woman
indeed
she
could
talk
she
had
brains
ideas
and
lord
bless
us
theories
she
had
that
thing
in
woman
not
only
a
voice
which
she
had
too
but
character
narcissus
began
to
loose
his
regal
robes
and
from
being
merely
courteously
to
be
genuinely
interested
why
she
was
a
discovery
as
they
walked
on
her
genuine
delight
in
the
autumnal
nature
the
real
imaginative
appeal
it
had
for
her
was
another
surprise
she
had
evidently
a
deep
poetry
in
her
disposition
rarest
of
all
female
endowments
in
a
surprisingly
few
minutes
from
the
beginning
of
their
walk
he
found
himself
taking
that
child
with
extreme
seriousness
and
wondering
many
they
walked
out
again
and
yet
again
and
narcissus
first
impressions
deepened
he
had
his
theories
too
and
surely
here
was
the
woman
he
was
not
in
love
at
least
not
with
her
but
with
her
fitness
for
his
theory
they
sat
by
a
solitary
woodside
beneath
a
great
elm
tree
the
hour
was
full
of
magic
for
though
the
sun
had
set
the
smile
of
her
day
joy
with
him
had
not
yet
faded
from
the
face
of
earth
it
was
the
hour
vulgarised
in
ballads
as
the
they
sat
very
near
to
each
other
he
held
her
hand
toying
with
it
and
now
and
again
their
eyes
met
with
the
look
that
flutters
before
flight
that
says
i
give
thee
all
dare
i
throw
my
eyes
on
thine
as
i
would
throw
myself
on
thee
and
then
at
last
came
the
inevitable
moment
when
the
eyes
of
each
seem
to
cry
yes
to
the
other
and
the
gates
fly
back
all
the
hidden
light
springs
forth
the
woods
swim
round
and
the
lips
meet
with
a
strange
shock
while
the
eyes
of
the
spirit
close
in
a
lapping
dream
of
great
peace
if
you
are
not
ready
to
play
the
man
beware
of
a
kiss
such
as
the
lips
of
little
hesper
that
never
knew
to
kiss
before
pressed
upon
the
mouth
of
narcissus
it
sent
a
chill
shudder
through
him
though
it
was
so
sweet
for
he
could
feel
her
whole
life
surging
behind
it
and
was
the
kiss
he
had
given
her
for
it
such
a
kiss
as
that
but
he
had
spoken
much
to
her
of
his
ideas
of
marriage
she
knew
he
was
sworn
for
ever
against
that
she
must
know
the
kiss
had
no
such
meaning
for
besides
did
she
not
scorn
the
soiled
also
were
not
their
theories
at
one
in
that
he
would
be
doing
her
no
wrong
it
was
her
own
desire
yet
his
kiss
did
mean
more
than
he
could
have
imagined
it
meaning
a
week
before
she
had
grown
to
be
genuinely
desirable
if
love
tarried
passion
was
awake
that
dangerous
passion
too
to
which
the
intellect
has
added
its
intoxication
and
that
is
so
to
say
legitimised
by
an
her
woman
intuition
read
the
silence
and
answered
to
his
thought
no
fear
she
said
with
the
deep
deliberation
of
passion
love
you
with
my
whole
life
but
i
shall
never
burden
you
narcissus
love
me
as
long
as
you
can
i
shall
be
content
and
when
the
end
comes
though
another
woman
takes
you
i
shall
not
hinder
o
great
what
a
poltroon
indeed
was
narcissus
beside
you
at
that
moment
you
ready
to
stake
your
life
on
the
throw
he
temporising
and
bargaining
as
over
the
terms
of
a
lease
surely
if
he
could
for
one
moment
have
seen
himself
in
the
light
of
your
greatness
he
had
been
crushed
beneath
the
misery
of
his
own
meanness
but
as
yet
he
had
no
such
vision
his
one
thought
was
will
do
it
will
she
draw
back
and
the
feeble
warnings
he
was
obliged
to
utter
to
keep
his
own
terms
by
assuring
his
conscience
of
were
they
not
whispered
and
with
an
inward
haste
lest
they
should
give
her
pause
the
world
my
dear
think
will
have
cruel
names
for
thee
will
make
thee
outcast
think
know
all
she
had
answered
i
love
you
and
two
years
of
your
love
would
pay
for
all
there
is
no
world
for
me
but
you
till
i
have
never
lived
at
all
and
when
you
go
i
shall
be
as
dead
the
world
can
not
hurt
such
a
one
ah
me
it
was
a
wild
sweet
dream
for
both
of
them
one
the
woman
one
the
poet
of
a
impossible
taking
flesh
for
do
not
let
us
blame
narcissus
overmuch
he
was
utterly
sincere
he
meant
no
wrong
he
but
dreamed
of
following
a
creed
to
which
his
reason
had
long
given
a
hopeless
assent
in
a
more
community
he
might
have
followed
it
and
all
have
been
well
but
the
world
has
to
be
dealt
with
as
one
finds
it
and
we
must
get
sad
answers
to
many
a
fair
calculation
if
we
it
wrongly
in
the
equation
that
there
is
one
law
for
the
male
and
another
for
the
female
had
not
as
yet
vitally
entered
into
his
considerations
he
was
too
dizzy
with
the
dream
or
he
must
have
seen
what
an
unequal
bargain
he
was
about
to
drive
at
last
he
did
awake
and
saw
it
all
and
in
a
burning
shame
went
to
hesper
and
told
her
that
it
must
not
be
her
answer
was
unconsciously
the
most
subtly
dangerous
she
could
have
chosen
i
like
to
give
myself
to
you
why
should
you
not
take
me
it
is
of
my
own
my
eyes
are
open
it
was
his
very
thought
put
into
words
and
by
her
for
a
moment
he
wavered
who
could
blame
him
i
my
brother
keeper
a
thousand
times
yes
cried
his
soul
for
he
was
awake
now
and
he
had
come
to
see
the
dream
as
it
was
and
to
shudder
at
himself
as
he
had
been
just
as
one
shudders
at
the
thought
of
a
precipice
barely
escaped
in
that
moment
too
the
idea
of
her
love
in
all
its
divineness
burst
upon
him
here
was
a
heart
capable
of
a
great
tragic
love
like
the
loves
of
old
he
read
of
and
whimpered
for
in
sonnets
and
what
had
he
offered
in
exchange
a
poor
philosophical
compromise
compounded
of
pessimism
and
desire
in
which
a
man
should
have
all
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose
for
light
light
love
he
has
wings
to
fly
at
suspicion
of
a
bond
would
i
did
love
her
his
heart
was
crying
as
he
went
away
i
love
her
was
his
next
thought
i
love
her
but
that
is
a
question
that
always
needs
longer
than
one
day
to
answer
already
he
was
as
much
in
love
with
her
as
most
men
when
they
take
unto
themselves
wives
she
was
desirable
he
had
pleasure
in
her
presence
he
had
that
half
of
love
which
commonly
passes
for
all
the
passion
but
he
lacked
the
additional
incentives
which
nerve
the
common
man
to
face
that
fear
which
seems
as
universal
as
the
fear
of
death
i
mean
the
fear
of
marriage
life
two
fears
that
is
he
had
no
desire
to
increase
his
worldly
possessions
by
annexing
a
dowry
or
ambition
of
settling
down
and
procuring
a
wife
as
part
of
his
establishment
after
all
how
full
of
bachelors
the
world
would
be
if
it
were
not
for
these
motives
for
the
one
other
motive
to
a
true
marriage
the
other
half
of
love
however
one
names
it
is
it
not
a
clover
indeed
narcissus
was
happily
poor
enough
to
be
above
those
motives
even
had
hesper
been
anything
but
poor
too
and
if
he
was
to
marry
her
it
would
be
because
he
was
capable
of
loving
her
with
that
perfect
love
which
of
course
has
alone
right
to
the
sacred
name
that
which
can
not
take
all
and
give
nought
but
which
rather
holds
as
watchword
that
love
is
better
than
to
be
who
shall
hope
to
express
the
mystery
yet
is
not
thus
much
true
that
if
it
must
be
allowed
to
the
cynic
that
love
rises
in
self
it
yet
has
its
zenith
and
setting
in
another
in
woman
as
in
man
two
meet
and
passion
the
joy
of
the
selfish
part
of
each
is
born
shall
love
follow
depends
on
whether
they
have
a
particular
grace
of
nature
love
being
the
thanksgiving
of
the
unselfish
part
for
the
boon
granted
to
the
other
the
common
nature
snatches
the
joy
and
forgets
the
giver
but
the
finer
never
forgets
and
deems
life
but
a
poor
service
for
a
gift
so
rare
and
though
passion
be
long
since
passed
love
keeps
holy
an
eternal
memory
took
up
the
harp
of
life
and
smote
on
all
the
chords
with
might
smote
the
chord
of
self
that
trembling
pass
in
music
out
of
sight
since
the
time
of
love
has
had
a
way
of
coming
in
the
disguise
of
duty
what
is
the
story
of
beauty
and
the
beast
but
an
allegory
of
true
love
we
take
this
maid
to
be
our
wedded
wife
for
her
sake
it
perhaps
seems
at
the
time
she
is
sweet
and
beautiful
and
to
be
desired
but
all
the
same
we
had
rather
shake
the
loose
leg
of
bachelordom
if
it
might
be
however
it
be
so
we
take
her
or
maybe
it
is
she
takes
us
with
a
feeling
of
martyrdom
but
lo
when
we
are
home
together
what
wonderful
new
lights
are
these
beginning
to
ray
about
her
as
though
she
had
up
till
now
kept
a
star
hidden
in
her
bosom
what
is
this
new
morning
strength
and
peace
in
our
life
why
we
thought
it
was
but
thestylis
and
lo
it
is
diana
after
all
for
the
thirteenth
maid
or
the
thirteenth
man
both
alike
rarely
come
as
we
had
expected
there
seems
no
fitness
in
their
arrival
it
seems
so
ridiculously
accidental
as
i
suppose
the
hour
of
death
whenever
it
comes
will
seem
one
had
expected
some
high
calm
prelude
of
preparation
ending
in
a
festival
of
choice
like
an
indian
prince
when
the
maids
of
the
land
pass
before
him
and
he
makes
deliberate
selection
of
the
fateful
she
but
instead
we
are
hurrying
among
our
day
business
maybe
our
last
thought
of
her
we
turn
a
corner
and
suddenly
she
is
before
us
or
perhaps
as
it
fell
with
narcissus
we
have
tried
many
loves
that
proved
but
passions
we
have
just
buried
the
last
and
are
mournfully
leaving
its
grave
determined
to
seek
no
further
to
abjure
bright
eyes
at
least
for
a
long
while
when
lo
on
a
sudden
a
little
maid
is
in
our
path
holding
out
some
sweet
modest
flowers
the
maid
has
a
sweet
mouth
too
and
the
old
adam
being
stronger
than
our
infant
resolution
we
smell
the
flowers
and
kiss
the
mouth
to
find
arms
that
somehow
we
know
not
why
are
clinging
as
for
life
about
us
let
us
beware
how
we
shake
them
off
for
thus
it
is
decreed
shall
a
man
meet
her
to
have
missed
whom
were
to
have
missed
all
youth
like
that
faithless
generation
in
the
scriptures
always
craveth
after
a
sign
but
rarely
shall
one
be
given
it
can
only
be
known
whether
a
man
be
worthy
of
love
by
the
way
in
which
he
looks
upon
duty
rachel
often
comes
in
the
grey
cloak
of
leah
it
rests
with
the
man
heart
whether
he
shall
know
her
beneath
the
disguise
no
other
shall
aid
him
if
it
be
as
bassanio
brave
to
and
hazard
all
he
hath
let
him
not
fear
to
pass
the
seeming
gold
the
seeming
silver
to
choose
the
seeming
lead
the
lady
thou
poor
magnificent
morocco
nor
shall
the
gold
fail
for
her
heart
is
that
and
for
silver
thou
shalt
have
those
silver
lights
undreamed
of
of
face
and
soul
these
are
but
scattered
hints
of
the
story
of
narcissus
love
as
he
told
it
me
at
last
in
broken
struggling
words
but
with
a
light
in
his
face
one
power
alone
could
set
there
when
he
came
to
the
end
and
to
all
that
little
hesper
had
proved
to
him
all
the
strength
and
illumination
she
had
brought
him
he
fairly
broke
down
and
sobbed
as
one
may
in
a
brother
arms
for
of
course
he
had
come
out
of
the
ordeal
a
man
and
hesper
had
consented
to
be
his
wife
often
she
had
dreamed
as
he
had
passed
her
by
with
such
heedless
air
i
love
him
so
can
it
be
that
my
love
shall
have
no
power
to
make
him
mine
somehow
some
day
can
i
call
to
him
so
within
my
soul
and
he
not
hear
can
i
wait
and
he
not
come
and
her
love
had
been
strong
strong
as
a
destiny
her
voice
had
reached
him
for
it
was
the
voice
of
god
when
i
next
saw
her
what
a
strange
brightness
shone
in
her
face
what
a
new
beauty
was
there
ah
love
the
great
transfigurer
and
why
too
was
it
that
his
friends
began
to
be
dissatisfied
with
their
old
photographs
of
narcissus
though
they
had
been
taken
but
six
months
before
there
seemed
something
lacking
in
the
photograph
they
said
yes
there
was
but
the
face
had
lacked
it
too
what
was
the
new
thing
was
it
joy
peace
yes
all
three
but
more
besides
and
narcissus
had
but
one
name
for
all
it
was
hesper
strange
too
that
in
spite
of
promises
we
never
received
a
new
one
narcissus
who
used
to
be
so
punctual
with
such
a
request
perhaps
it
was
because
he
had
broken
his
chapter
x
what
avatar
i
love
you
for
a
year
i
shall
love
you
for
ever
narcissus
had
said
to
his
thirteenth
maid
he
did
love
her
so
long
and
yet
he
has
gone
away
do
you
remember
your
that
early
chapter
where
valjean
robs
the
child
of
his
florin
so
soon
after
that
great
illuminating
change
of
heart
and
mind
had
come
to
him
well
still
more
important
do
you
remember
the
clue
hugo
gives
us
to
aberration
there
is
comfort
and
strength
for
so
many
a
failure
there
it
was
the
old
impetus
we
are
told
that
was
as
yet
too
strong
for
the
new
control
the
old
instinct
too
dark
for
the
new
light
in
the
brain
it
takes
every
vessel
some
time
to
answer
to
its
helm
with
us
human
vessels
years
maybe
have
you
never
suddenly
become
sensitive
of
a
gracious
touch
in
the
air
and
pondered
it
to
recognise
that
in
some
act
you
had
that
moment
been
answering
for
the
first
time
the
helm
of
an
almost
forgotten
resolution
ah
me
blessed
is
it
to
see
the
prow
strongly
sweeping
up
against
the
sky
at
last
not
a
poet
to
london
said
heine
and
it
was
a
true
word
at
least
send
him
not
till
his
thews
are
laced
and
his
bones
set
he
may
miss
somewhat
of
course
there
is
no
gain
without
a
loss
he
may
be
in
ignorance
of
the
last
and
if
he
deserves
fame
he
must
gain
it
unaided
of
the
vulgar
notoriety
which
if
he
have
a
friend
or
two
in
the
new
journalism
they
will
be
so
eager
to
bestow
but
he
will
have
kept
his
soul
intact
which
after
all
is
the
main
matter
it
is
sweet
doubtless
to
be
one
of
those
same
sweet
to
be
placarded
as
new
this
or
that
to
step
for
a
day
into
the
triumphal
car
of
newspaper
renown
drawn
by
teams
of
willing
who
does
it
never
strike
you
are
but
doing
it
all
for
hire
and
earning
their
bread
by
their
bent
necks
yet
for
those
to
whom
it
is
denied
there
is
solid
comfort
for
it
is
not
fame
and
worse
still
it
is
not
life
is
but
to
be
bourbon
in
a
crown
of
straws
if
one
could
only
take
poor
foolish
cockneydom
right
away
outside
this
poor
vainglorious
city
and
show
them
how
the
stars
are
smiling
to
themselves
above
it
nudging
each
other
so
to
say
at
the
silly
lights
that
ape
their
shining
for
such
a
little
while
yes
that
is
one
danger
of
the
poet
in
london
that
he
should
come
to
think
himself
though
doubtless
in
proportion
as
he
is
a
poet
the
other
danger
will
be
the
greater
that
he
should
deem
himself
modest
by
nature
credulous
of
appearances
the
noisy
pretensions
of
the
hundred
and
one
small
celebrities
and
the
din
of
their
retainers
this
side
and
that
in
comparison
with
his
own
unattended
course
what
wonder
if
his
heart
sinks
and
he
gives
up
the
game
how
shall
his
little
pipe
though
it
be
of
silver
hope
to
be
heard
in
this
land
of
bassoons
to
take
london
seriously
is
death
both
to
man
and
artist
narcissus
had
sufficient
success
there
to
make
this
a
temptation
and
he
fell
he
lost
his
hold
of
the
great
things
of
life
he
forgot
the
stars
he
forgot
his
love
and
what
wonder
that
his
art
sickened
also
for
a
few
months
life
was
but
a
feverish
clutch
after
varied
sensation
especially
the
dear
tickle
of
applause
he
caught
the
facile
atheistic
flippancy
of
that
poor
creature
the
young
man
and
and
he
came
very
near
losing
his
soul
in
the
nightmare
but
he
had
too
much
ballast
in
him
to
go
quite
under
and
at
last
strength
came
and
he
shook
the
weakness
from
him
yet
the
fall
had
been
too
far
and
too
cruel
for
him
to
be
happy
again
soon
he
had
gone
forth
so
confident
in
his
new
strength
of
manly
love
and
to
fall
so
and
almost
without
an
effort
who
has
not
called
upon
the
mountains
to
cover
him
in
such
an
hour
of
awakening
and
who
will
wonder
that
narcissus
dared
not
look
upon
the
face
of
hesper
till
solitude
had
washed
him
clean
and
bathed
him
in
its
healing
oil
i
alone
bade
him
it
was
in
this
room
wherein
i
am
writing
the
study
we
had
taken
together
where
still
his
books
look
down
at
me
from
the
shelves
and
all
the
memorials
of
his
young
life
remain
o
it
have
been
but
phantom
of
false
morning
a
milton
snatched
up
at
the
last
moment
was
the
one
book
he
took
with
him
from
that
night
until
this
he
has
made
but
one
sign
a
little
note
which
hesper
has
shown
me
a
sob
and
a
cry
to
which
even
a
love
that
had
been
more
deeply
wronged
could
never
have
turned
a
deaf
ear
surely
not
hesper
for
she
has
long
forgiven
him
knowing
his
weakness
for
what
it
was
she
and
i
sometimes
sit
here
together
in
the
evenings
and
talk
of
him
and
every
echo
in
the
corridor
sets
us
listening
for
he
may
be
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
or
but
the
other
side
of
the
street
we
know
so
little
of
his
fate
where
he
is
we
know
not
but
if
he
still
lives
he
is
we
have
the
assurance
of
faith
this
time
he
has
not
failed
we
know
but
why
delay
so
long
the
end
