preface
it
is
to
be
regretted
the
world
does
not
discriminate
more
justly
in
its
use
of
political
terms
governments
are
usually
called
either
monarchies
or
republics
the
former
class
embraces
equally
those
institutions
in
which
the
sovereign
is
worshipped
as
a
god
and
those
in
which
he
performs
the
humble
office
of
a
manikin
in
the
latter
we
find
aristocracies
and
democracies
blended
in
the
same
generic
appellation
the
consequence
of
a
generalization
so
wide
is
an
utter
confusion
on
the
subject
of
the
polity
of
states
the
author
has
endeavored
to
give
his
countrymen
in
this
book
a
picture
of
the
social
system
of
one
of
the
republics
of
the
other
hemisphere
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
portray
historical
characters
only
too
fictitious
in
their
graver
dress
but
simply
to
set
forth
the
familiar
operations
of
venetian
policy
for
the
justification
of
his
likeness
after
allowing
for
the
defects
of
execution
he
refers
to
the
work
of
daru
a
history
of
the
progress
of
political
liberty
written
purely
in
the
interests
of
humanity
is
still
a
desideratum
in
literature
in
nations
which
have
made
a
false
commencement
it
would
be
found
that
the
citizen
or
rather
the
subject
has
extorted
immunity
after
immunity
as
his
growing
intelligence
and
importance
have
both
instructed
and
required
him
to
defend
those
particular
rights
which
were
necessary
to
his
a
certain
accumulation
of
these
immunities
constitutes
with
a
solitary
and
recent
exception
in
switzerland
the
essence
of
european
liberty
even
at
this
hour
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
tell
the
reader
that
this
freedom
be
it
more
or
less
depends
on
a
principle
entirely
different
from
our
own
here
the
immunities
do
not
proceed
from
but
they
are
granted
to
the
government
being
in
other
words
concessions
of
natural
rights
made
by
the
people
to
the
state
for
the
benefits
of
social
protection
so
long
as
this
vital
difference
exists
between
ourselves
and
other
nations
it
will
be
vain
to
think
of
finding
analogies
in
their
institutions
it
is
true
that
in
an
age
like
this
public
opinion
is
itself
a
charter
and
that
the
most
despotic
government
which
exists
within
the
pale
of
christendom
must
in
some
degree
respect
its
influence
the
mildest
and
justest
governments
in
europe
are
at
this
moment
theoretically
despotisms
the
characters
of
both
prince
and
people
enter
largely
into
the
consideration
of
so
extraordinary
results
and
it
should
never
be
forgotten
that
though
the
character
of
the
latter
be
sufficiently
secure
that
of
the
former
is
liable
to
change
but
admitting
every
benefit
which
possibly
can
flow
from
a
just
administration
with
wise
and
humane
princes
a
government
which
is
not
properly
based
on
the
people
possesses
an
unavoidable
and
oppressive
evil
of
the
first
magnitude
in
the
necessity
of
supporting
itself
by
physical
force
and
onerous
impositions
against
the
natural
action
of
the
majority
were
we
to
characterize
a
republic
we
should
say
it
was
a
state
in
which
power
both
theoretically
and
practically
is
derived
from
the
nation
with
a
constant
responsibility
of
the
agents
of
the
public
to
the
people
a
responsibility
that
is
neither
to
be
evaded
nor
denied
that
such
a
system
is
better
on
a
large
than
on
a
small
scale
though
contrary
to
brilliant
theories
which
have
been
written
to
uphold
different
institutions
must
be
evident
on
the
smallest
reflection
since
the
danger
of
all
popular
governments
is
from
popular
mistakes
and
a
people
of
diversified
interests
and
extended
territorial
possessions
are
much
less
likely
to
be
the
subjects
of
sinister
passions
than
the
inhabitants
of
a
single
town
or
county
if
to
this
definition
we
should
add
as
an
infallible
test
of
the
genus
that
a
true
republic
is
a
government
of
which
all
others
are
jealous
and
vituperative
on
the
instinct
of
we
believe
there
would
be
no
mistaking
the
class
how
far
venice
would
have
been
obnoxious
to
this
proof
the
reader
is
left
to
judge
for
himself

and
a
dying

had
disappeared
behind

summits
of
the
tyrolean
alps
and
the
moon
was
already
risen
above
the
low
barrier
of
the
lido
hundreds
of
pedestrians
were
pouring
out
of
the
narrow
streets
of

into
the
square

to

the
scene
the
most
remarkable
of

on
the
very
confines
of
that
line
which
separates
western
from
eastern
europe
and
in
constant
communication
with
the
latter
venice
possessed
a
greater
admixture
of
character
and
costume
than
any
other
of
the
numerous
ports
of
that
region
a
portion
of
this
peculiarity
is
still
to
be
observed
under
the
fallen
fortunes
of
the
place
but
at
the
period
of
our
tale
the
city
of
the
isles
though
no
longer
mistress
of
the
mediterranean
nor
even
of
the
adriatic
was
still
rich
and
powerful
her
influence
was
felt
in
the
councils
of
the
civilized
world
and
her
commerce
though
waning
was
yet
sufficient
to
uphold
the
vast
possessions
of
those
families
whose
ancestors
had
become
rich
in
the
day
of
her
prosperity
men
lived
among
her
islands
in
that
state
of
incipient
lethargy
which
marks
the
progress
of
a
downward
course
whether
the
decline
be
of
a
moral
or
of
a
physical
decay
at
the
hour
we
have
named
the
vast
parallelogram
of
the
piazza
was
filling
fast
the
cafés
and
casinos
within
the
porticoes
which
surround
three
of
its
sides
being
already
thronged
with
company
while
all
beneath
the
arches
was
gay
and
brilliant
with
the
flare
of
torch
and
lamp
the
noble
range
of
edifices
called
the
procuratories
the
massive
pile
of
the
ducal
palace
the
most
ancient
christian
church
the
granite
columns
of
the
piazzetta
the
triumphal
masts
of
the
great
square
and
the
giddy
tower
of
the
campanile
were
slumbering
in
the
more
mellow
glow
of
the
moon
facing
the
wide
area
of
the
great
square
stood
the
quaint
and
venerable
cathedral
of
san
marco
a
temple
of
trophies
and
one
equally
proclaiming
the
prowess
and
the
piety
of
its
founders
this
remarkable
structure
presided
over
the
other
fixtures
of
the
place
like
a
monument
of
the
republic
antiquity
and
greatness
its
saracenic
architecture
the
rows
of
precious
but
useless
little
columns
that
load
its
front
the
low
asiatic
domes
which
rest
upon
its
walls
in
the
repose
of
a
thousand
years
the
rude
and
gaudy
mosaics
and
above
all
the
captured
horses
of
corinth
which
start
from

sombre
mass

of

from
the
solemn
and
appropriate
light
a
character
of
melancholy
and
mystery
that
well
comported
with
the
thick
recollections
which
crowd
the
mind
as
the
eye
gazes
at
this
rare
relic
of
the
past
as
fit
companions
to
this
edifice

other
peculiar
ornaments
of
the
place
stood
at
hand
the
base
of
the
campanile
lay
in
shadow
but
a
hundred
feet
of
its
grey
summit
received
the
full
rays
of
the
moon
along
its
eastern
face
the
masts
destined
to
bear
the
conquered
ensigns
of
candia
constantinople
and
the
morea
cut
the
air
by
its
side
in
dark
and
fairy
lines
while
at
the
extremity
of
the
smaller
square
and
near
the
margin
of
the
sea
the
forms
of
the
winged
lion
and
the
patron
saint
of
the
city
each
on
his
column
of
african
granite
were
distinctly
traced
against
the
of
the
azure
sky
it
was
near
the
base
of
the
former
of
these
massive
blocks
of
stone
that
one
stood
who
seemed
to
gaze
at
the
animated
and
striking
scene
with
the
listlessness
and
indifference
of
satiety
a
multitude
some
in
masques
and
others
careless
of
being
known
had
poured
along
the
quay
into
the
piazzetta
on
their
way
to
the
principal
square
while
this
individual
had
scarce
turned
a
glance
aside
or
changed
a
limb
in
weariness
his
attitude
was
that
of
patient
practised
and
obedient
waiting
on
another
pleasure
with
folded
arms
a
body
poised
on
one
leg
and
a
vacant
though
eye
he
appeared
to
attend
some
beck
of
authority
ere
he
quitted
the
spot
a
silken
jacket
in
whose
tissue
flowers
of
the
gayest
colors
were
interwoven
the
falling
collar
of
scarlet
the
bright
velvet
cap
with
armorial
bearings
embroidered
on
its
front
proclaimed
him
to
be
a
gondolier
in
private
service
wearied
at
length
with
the
antics
of
a
distant
group
of
tumblers
whose
pile
of
human
bodies
had
for
a
time
arrested
his
look
this
individual
turned
away
and
faced
the
light
air
from
the
water
recognition
and
pleasure
shot
into
his
countenance
and
in
a
moment
his
arms
were
interlocked
with
those
of
a
swarthy
mariner
who
wore
the
loose
attire
and
phrygian
cap
of
men
of
his
calling
the
gondolier
was
the
first
to
speak
the
words
flowing
from
him
in
the
soft
accents
of
his
native
islands
is
it
thou
stefano
they
said
thou
hadst
fallen
into
the
gripe
of
the
devils
of
barbary
and
that
thou
wast
planting
flowers
for
an
infidel
with
thy
hands
and
watering
them
with
thy
tears
the
answer
was
in
the
harsher
dialect
of
calabria
and
it
was
given
with
the
rough
familiarity
of
a
seaman
la
bella
sorrentina
is
no
housekeeper
of
a
curato
she
is
not
a
damsel
to
take
a
siesta
with
a
tunisian
rover
prowling
about
in
her
neighborhood
hadst
ever
been
beyond
the
lido
thou
wouldst
have
known
the
difference
between
chasing
the
felucca
and
catching
her
kneel
down
and
thank
san
teodoro
for
his
care
there
was
much
praying
on
thy
decks
that
hour
caro
stefano
though
none
is
bolder
among
the
mountains
of
calabria
when
thy
felucca
is
once
safely
drawn
up
on
the
beach
the
mariner
cast
a
glance
upward
at
the
image
of
the
patron
saint
ere
he
replied
there
was
more
need
of
the
wings
of
thy
lion
than
of
the
favor
of
thy
saint
i
never
come
further
north
for
aid
than
san
gennaro
even
when
it
blows
a
hurricane
so
much
the
worse
for
thee
caro
since
the
good
bishop
is
better
at
stopping
the
lava
than
at
quieting
the
winds
but
there
was
danger
then
of
losing
the
felucca
and
her
brave
people
among
the
turks
there
was
in
truth
a
prowling
about
between
stromboli
and
sicily
but
ali
di
san
michele
he
might
better
have
chased
the
cloud
above
the
volcano
than
run
after
the
felucca
in
a
sirocco
thou
wast
stefano
i
i
was
more
like
thy
lion
here
with
some
small
additions
of
chains
and
muzzles
as
was
seen
by
thy
felucca
speed
cospetto
i
wished
myself
a
knight
of
san
giovanni
a
thousand
times
during
the
chase
and
la
bella
sorrentina
a
brave
maltese
galley
if
it
were
only
for
the
cause
of
christian
honor
the
miscreant
hung
upon
my
quarter
for
the
better
part
of
three
glasses
so
near
that
i
could
tell
which
of
the
knaves
wore
dirty
cloth
in
his
turban
and
which
clean
it
was
a
sore
sight
to
a
christian
stefano
to
see
the
right
thus
borne
upon
by
an
infidel
and
thy
feet
warmed
with
the
thought
of
the
bastinado
caro
mio
i
have
run
too
often
barefoot
over
our
calabrian
mountains
to
tingle
at
the
sole
with
every
fancy
of
that
sort
every
man
has
his
weak
spot
and
i
know
thine
to
be
dread
of
a
arm
thy
native
hills
have
their
soft
as
well
as
their
hard
ground
but
it
is
said
the
tunisian
chooses
a
board
knotty
as
his
own
heart
when
he
amuses
himself
with
the
wailings
of
a
christian
well
the
happiest
of
us
all
must
take
such
as
fortune
brings
if
my
soles
are
to
be
shod
with
blows
the
honest
priest
of
sant
agata
will
be
cheated
by
a
penitent
i
have
bargained
with
the
good
curato
that
all
such
accidental
calamities
shall
go
in
the
general
account
of
penance
but
how
fares
the
world
of
venice
and
what
dost
thou
among
the
canals
at
this
season
to
keep
the
flowers
of
thy
jacket
from
wilting
as
yesterday
and
will
be
as
i
row
the
gondola
from
the
rialto
to
the
giudecca
from

to

from
san

from

there
are
no
by
the
way
to
chill
the
heart

warm
the
feet
enough
of
friendship
and
is
there
nothing
stirring
in

no
young

drowned
nor
any

nothing
of
that
much
interest
except
the
calamity
which
befell

thou
rememberest

he
who
crossed
into
dalmatia
with
thee
once
as
a
supernumerary
the
time
he
was
suspected
of
having
aided
the
young
frenchman
in
running
away
with
a
senator
daughter
do
i
remember
the
last
famine
the
rogue
did
nothing
but
eat
maccaroni
and
swallow
the
lachryma
christi
which
the
dalmatian
count
had
on
freight
poverino
his
gondola
has
been
run
down
by
an
who
passed
over
the
boat
as
if
it
were
a
senator
stepping
on
a
fly
so
much
for
little
fish
coming
into
deep
water
the
honest
fellow
was
crossing
the
giudecca
with
a
stranger
who
had
occasion
to
say
his
prayers
at
the
redentore
when
the
brig
hit
him
in
the
canopy
and
broke
up
the
gondola
as
if
it
had
been
a
bubble
left
by
the
bucentaur
the
padrone
should
have
been
too
generous
to
complain
of
clumsiness
since
it
met
with
its
own
punishment
madre
di
dio
he
went
to
sea
that
hour
or
he
might
be
feeding
the
fishes
of
the
lagunes
there
is
not
a
gondolier
in
venice
who
did
not
feel
the
wrong
at
his
heart
and
we
know
how
to
obtain
justice
for
an
insult
as
well
as
our
masters
well
a
gondola
is
mortal
as
well
as
a
felucca
and
both
have
their
time
better
die
by
the
prow
of
a
brig
than
fall
into
the
gripe
of
a
turk
how
is
thy
young
master
gino
and
is
he
likely
to
obtain
his
claims
of
the
senate
he
cools
himself
in
the
giudecca
in
the
morning
and
if
thou
know
what
he
does
at
evening
thou
hast
only
to
look
among
the
nobles
in
the
broglio
as
the
gondolier
spoke
he
glanced
an
eye
aside
at
a
group
of
patrician
rank
who
paced
the
gloomy
arcades
which
supported
the
superior
walls
of
the
doge
palace
a
spot
sacred
at
times
to
the
uses
of
the
privileged
i
am
no
stranger
to
the
habit
thy
venetian
nobles
have
of
coming
to
that
low
colonnade
at
this
hour
but
i
never
before
heard
of
their
preferring
the
waters
of
the
giudecca
for
their
baths
were
even
the
doge
to
throw
himself
out
of
a
gondola
he
must
sink
or
swim
like
a
meaner
christian
acqua
dell
adriatico
was
the
young
duca
going
to
the
redentore
too
to
say
his
prayers
he
was
coming
back
after
having
but
what
matters
it
in
what
canal
a
young
noble
sighs
away
the
night
we
happened
to
be
near
when
the
performed
his
feat
while
giorgio
and
i
were
boiling
with
rage
at
the
awkwardness
of
the
stranger
my
master
who
never
had
much
taste
or
knowledge
in
gondolas
went
into
the
water
to
save
the
young
lady
from
sharing
the
fate
of
her
uncle
diavolo
this
is
the
first
syllable
thou
hast
uttered
concerning
any
young
lady
or
of
the
death
of
her
uncle
thou
wert
thinking
of
thy
and
hast
forgotten
i
must
have
told
thee
how
near
the
beautiful
signora
was
to
sharing
the
fate
of
the
gondola
and
how
the
loss
of
the
roman
marchese
weighs
in
addition
on
the
soul
of
the
padrone
santo
padre
that
a
christian
should
die
the
death
of
a
hunted
dog
by
the
carelessness
of
a
gondolier
it
may
have
been
lucky
for
the
that
it
so
fell
out
for
they
say
the
roman
was
one
of
influence
enough
to
make
a
senator
cross
the
bridge
of
sighs
at
need
the
devil
take
all
careless
watermen
say
i
and
what
became
of
the
awkward
rogue
i
tell
thee
he
went
outside
the
lido
that
very
hour
or
pietrello
he
was
brought
up
by
the
oar
of
giorgio
for
both
of
us
were
active
in
saving
the
cushions
and
other
valuables
thou
do
nothing
for
the
poor
roman
may
follow
that
brig
on
account
of
his
death
follow
her
say
i
till
she
lays
her
bones
on
some
rock
that
is
harder
than
the
heart
of
her
padrone
as
for
the
stranger
we
could
do
no
more
than
offer
up
a
prayer
to
san
teodoro
since
he
never
rose
after
the
blow
but
what
has
brought
thee
to
venice
caro
mio
for
thy
with
the
oranges
in
the
last
voyage
caused
thee
to
denounce
the
place
the
calabrian
laid
a
finger
on
one
cheek
and
drew
the
skin
down
in
a
manner
to
give
a
droll
expression
to
his
dark
comic
eye
while
the
whole
of
his
really
fine
grecian
face
was
charged
with
an
expression
of
coarse
humor
look
you
gino
thy
master
sometimes
calls
for
his
gondola
between
sunset
and
morning
an
owl
is
not
more
wakeful
than
he
has
been
of
late
this
head
of
mine
has
not
been
on
a
pillow
before
the
sun
has
come
above
the
lido
since
the
snows
melted
from
monselice
and
when
the
sun
of
thy
master
countenance
sets
in
his
own
palazzo
thou
hastenest
off
to
the
bridge
of
the
rialto
among
the
jewellers
and
butchers
to
proclaim
the
manner
in
which
he
passed
the
night
diamine
be
the
last
night
i
served
the
duca
di
sant
agata
were
my
tongue
so
limber
the
gondolier
and
the
confessor
are
the
two
of
a
noble
master
stefano
with
this
small
difference
that
the
last
only
knows
what
the
sinner
wishes
to
reveal
while
the
first
sometimes
knows
more
i
can
find
a
safer
if
not
a
more
honest
employment
than
to
be
running
about
with
my
master
secrets
in
the
air
and
i
am
wiser
than
to
let
every
jew
broker
in
san
marco
here
have
a
peep
into
my
nay
old
acquaintance
there
is
some
difference
between
our
occupations
after
all
a
padrone
of
a
felucca
can
not
in
justice
be
compared
to
the
most
confidential
gondolier
of
a
neapolitan
duke
who
has
an
unsettled
right
to
be
admitted
to
the
council
of
three
hundred
just
the
difference
between
smooth
water
and
rough
you
ruffle
the
surface
of
a
canal
with
a
lazy
oar
while
i
run
the
channel
of
piombino
in
a
mistral
shoot
the
faro
of
messina
in
a
white
squall
double
santa
maria
di
leuca
in
a
breathing
levanter
and
come
skimming
up
the
adriatic
before
a
sirocco
that
is
hot
enough
to
cook
my
maccaroni
and
which
sets
the
whole
sea
boiling
worse
than
the
caldrons
of
scylla
hist
eagerly
interrupted
the
gondolier
who
had
indulged
with
italian
humor
in
the
controversy
for
preeminence
though
without
any
real
feeling
here
comes
one
who
may
think
else
we
shall
have
need
of
his
hand
to
settle
the
dispute
eccolo
the
calabrian
recoiled
apace
in
silence
and
stood
regarding
the
individual
who
had
caused
this
hurried
remark
with
a
gloomy
but
steady
air
the
stranger
moved
slowly
past
his
years
were
under
thirty
though
the
calm
gravity
of
his
countenance
imparted
to
it
a
character
of
more
mature
age
the
cheeks
were
bloodless
but
they
betrayed
rather
the
pallid
hue
of
mental
than
of
bodily
disease
the
perfect
condition
of
the
physical
man
was
sufficiently
exhibited
in
the
muscular
fulness
of
a
body
which
though
light
and
active
gave
every
indication
of
strength
his
step
was
firm
assured
and
even
his
carriage
erect
and
easy
and
his
whole
mien
was
strongly
characterized
by
a
that
could
scarcely
escape
observation
and
yet
his
attire
was
that
of
an
inferior
class
a
doublet
of
common
velvet
a
dark
montero
cap
such
as
was
then
much
used
in
the
southern
countries
of
europe
with
other
vestments
of
a
similar
fashion
composed
his
dress
the
face
was
melancholy
rather
than
sombre
and
its
perfect
repose
accorded
well
with
the
striking
calmness
of
the
body
the
lineaments
of
the
former
however
were
bold
and
even
noble
exhibiting
that
strong
and
manly
outline
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
finer
class
of
the
italian
countenance
out
of
this
striking
array
of
features
gleamed
an
eye
that
was
full
of
brilliancy
meaning
and
passion
as
the
stranger
passed
his
glittering
organs
rolled
over
the
persons
of
the
gondolier
and
his
companion
but
the
look
though
searching
was
entirely
without
interest
was
the
wandering
but
wary
glance
which
men
who
have
much
reason
to
distrust
habitually
cast
on
a
multitude
it
turned
with
the
same
jealous
keenness
on
the
face
of
the
next
it
encountered
and
by
the
time
the
steady
and
well
balanced
form
was
lost
in
the
crowd
that
quick
and
glowing
eye
had
gleamed
in
the
same
rapid
and
uneasy
manner
on
twenty
others
neither
the
gondolier
nor
the
mariner
of
calabria
spoke
until
their
riveted
gaze
after
the
retiring
figure
became
useless
then
the
former
simply
ejaculated
with
a
strong
respiration
jacopo
his
companion
raised
three
of
his
fingers
with
an
occult
meaning
towards
the
palace
of
the
doges
do
they
let
him
take
the
air
even
in
san
marco
he
asked
in
unfeigned
surprise
it
is
not
easy
caro
amico
to
make
water
run
up
stream
or
to
stop
the
downward
current
it
is
said
that
most
of
the
senators
would
sooner
lose
their
hopes
of
the
horned
bonnet
than
lose
him
jacopo
he
knows
more
family
secrets
than
the
good
priore
of
san
marco
himself
and
he
poor
man
is
half
his
time
in
the
confessional
aye
they
are
afraid
to
put
him
in
an
iron
jacket
lest
awkward
secrets
should
be
squeezed
out
corpo
di
bacco
there
would
be
little
peace
in
venice
if
the
council
of
three
should
take
it
into
their
heads
to
loosen
the
tongue
of
yonder
man
in
that
rude
manner
but
they
say
gino
that
thy
council
of
three
has
a
fashion
of
feeding
the
fishes
of
the
lagunes
which
might
throw
the
suspicion
of
his
death
on
some
unhappy
were
the
body
ever
to
come
up
again
well
no
need
of
bawling
it
aloud
as
if
thou
wert
hailing
a
sicilian
through
thy
trumpet
though
the
fact
should
be
so
to
say
the
truth
there
are
few
men
in
business
who
are
thought
to
have
more
custom
than
he
who
has
just
gone
up
the
piazzetta
two
sequins
rejoined
the
calabrian
enforcing
his
meaning
by
a
significant
grimace
santa
madonna
thou
forgettest
stefano
that
not
even
the
confessor
has
any
trouble
with
a
job
in
which
he
has
been
employed
not
a
caratano
less
than
a
hundred
will
buy
a
stroke
of
his
art
your
blows
for
two
sequins
leave
a
man
leisure
to
tell
tales
or
even
to
say
his
prayers
half
the
time
jacopo
ejaculated
the
other
with
an
emphasis
which
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
summing
up
of
all
his
aversion
and
horror
the
gondolier
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
quite
as
much
meaning
as
a
man
born
on
the
shores
of
the
baltic
could
have
conveyed
by
words
but
he
too
appeared
to
think
the
matter
exhausted
stefano

he
added
after
a
moment
of
pause
are
things
in
venice
which
he
who
would
eat
his
maccaroni
in
peace
would
do
well
to
forget
let
thy
errand
in

be
what
it
may
thou
art
in
good

the
regatta
which
will
be

hast
thou
an
oar
for
that
race

under
the
patronage
of

the
prize
will
be
a
silver
gondola
to
him
who
is
lucky
or
skilful
enough
to
win
and
then
we
shall
have
the
nuptials
with

thy
nobles
had
best
woo
the
bride
well
for
there
are
heretics
who
lay
claim
to
her
good
will
i
met
a
rover
of
strange
rig
and
miraculous
fleetness
in
rounding
the
headlands
of
otranto
who
seemed
to
have
half
a
mind
to
follow
the
felucca
in
her
path
towards
the
lagunes
did
the
sight
warm
thee
at
the
soles
of
thy
feet
gino
dear
there
was
not
a
turbaned
head
on
his
deck
but
every
sat
upon
a
well
covered
poll
and
a
shorn
chin
thy
bucentaur
is
no
longer
the
bravest
craft
that
floats
between
dalmatia
and
the
islands
though
her
gilding
may
glitter
brightest
there
are
men
beyond
the
pillars
of
hercules
who
are
not
satisfied
with
doing
all
that
can
be
done
on
their
own
coasts
but
who
are
pretending
to
do
much
of
that
which
can
be
done
on
ours
the
republic
is
a
little
aged
caro
and
years
need
rest
the
joints
of
the
bucentaur
are
racked
by
time
and
many
voyages
to
the
lido
i
have
heard
my
master
say
that
the
leap
of
the
winged
lion
is
not
as
far
as
it
was
even
in
his
young
days
don
camillo
has
the
reputation
of
talking
boldly
of
the
foundation
of
this
city
of
piles
when
he
has
the
roof
of
old
sant
agata
safely
over
his
head
were
he
to
speak
more
reverently
of
the
horned
bonnet
and
of
the
council
of
three
his
pretensions
to
succeed
to
the
rights
of
his
forefathers
might
seem
juster
in
the
eyes
of
his
judges
but
distance
is
a
great
mellower
of
colors
and
softener
of
fears
my
own
opinion
of
the
speed
of
the
felucca
and
of
the
merits
of
a
turk
undergo
changes
of
this
sort
between
port
and
the
open
sea
and
i
have
known
thee
good
gino
forget
san
teodoro
and
bawl
as
lustily
to
san
gennaro
when
at
naples
as
if
thou
really
fancied
thyself
in
danger
from
the
mountain
one
must
speak
to
those
at
hand
in
order
to
be
quickest

rejoined
the
gondolier
casting
a
glance
that
was
partly
humorous
and
not
without
superstition
upwards
at
the
image
which
crowned
the
granite
column
against
whose
pedestal
he
still
leaned
a
truth
which
warns
us
to
be
prudent

a
look
this
way
as

he
felt
a
conscientious
scruple
in
letting
any
irreverent
remark

go
without

said
to
have
other
dealings
with
the

hundred
besides
asking
for
the
moneys
he
has
lent
to
their
sons
and
so
stefano
thou
thinkest
the
republic
will
never
plant
another
mast
of
triumph
in
san
marco
or
bring
more
trophies
to
the
venerable
church
napoli
herself
with
her
constant
change
of
masters
is
as
likely
to
do
a
great
act
on
the

as
thy
winged
beast
just
now
thou
art
well
enough
to
row
a
gondola
in
the
canals
gino
or
to
follow
thy
master
to
his
calabrian
castle
but
if
thou
know
what
passes
in
the
wide
world
thou
must
be
content
to
listen
to

of
the
long
course
the
day
of

has
gone
by
and
that

more
north

come
thou
hast
been
much
of
late
among

genoese
stefano
that
thou
comest
hither
with
these
idle
tales
of
what
a

do

what
has

performed

zitto
that

is
a
great
word
with

thou
art
as
proud
of
the
past
as
a
roman

and
the
roman
of

right
is
it
nothing

now
the
enjoyment
of

is

the
pleasure
of

dreams
of
the
wine
he
drank
yesterday
this
is
well
for
a
neapolitan
whose
country
never
was
a
nation
returned
the
gondolier
angrily
i
have
heard
don
camillo
who
is
one
educated
as
well
as
born
in
the
land
often
say
that
half
of
the
people
of

have
ridden

used
the
legs
of

said
a
voice

authority
near
the
gondolier

he
who
interrupted
the
dialogue
pointed
to
the
boat
without
saying
more
a
rivederli
hastily
muttered
the
gondolier
his
friend
squeezed
his
hand
in
perfect
amity
for
in
truth
they
were
countrymen
by
birth
though
chance
had
trained
the
former
on
the

next

arranging
the

aroused

in
the
pavilion
with
an
arm
leaning
on
the
top
of
the
canopy
and
his
cloak
thrown
loosely
over

shoulder
the
young

stood
in
a
musing
attitude
until
his
dexterous
servitors
had
extricated
the
boat
from
the
little
fleet
which
crowded
the
quay
and
had
urged
it
into

water
this
duty
performed
gino
touched
his
scarlet
cap
and
looked
at
his
master
as
if
to
inquire
the
direction
in
which
they
were
to
proceed
he
was
answered
by

silent
gesture
that

thou
wast
speaking
to
a
stranger
when
i
summoned
thee
to
the
gondola
i
was
asking
the
news
of
our
calabrian
hills
from
one
who
has
come
into
port
with
his
felucca
though
the
man
took
the
name
of
san

to
witness
that
his
former
luckless
voyage
should
be
the
last
how
does
he
call

happy
fortune
too
for
the
good
curato
recommended
it
with
many
a
devout
prayer
to
the
virgin
and
to
san
francesco
the
noble
appeared
to
lend
more
attention
to
the
discourse
which
until
now
on
his
part
had
been
commenced
in
the
listless
manner
with
which
a
superior
encourages
an
indulged
dependant
la
bella
sorrentina
have
i
not
reason
to
know
the
bark
nothing
more
true
signore
her
padrone
has
relations
at
sant
agata
as
i
have
told
your
eccellenza
and
his
vessel
has
lain
on
the
beach
near
the
castle
many
a
bleak
winter
what
brings
him
to
venice
that
is
what
i
would
give
my
newest
jacket
of
your
eccellenza
colors
to
know
signore
i
have
as
little
wish
to
inquire
into
other
affairs
as
any
one
and
i
very
well
know
that
discretion
is
the
chief
virtue
of
a
gondolier
i
ventured
however
a
deadly
hint
concerning
his
errand
such
as
ancient
neighborhood
would
warrant
but
he
was
as
cautious
of
his
answers
as
if
he
were
freighted
with
the
confessions
of
fifty
christians
now
if
your
eccellenza
should
see
fit
to
give
me
authority
to
question
him
in
your
name
the
deuce
is
i
if
between
respect
for
his
lord
and
good
management
we
could
not
draw
something
more
than
a
false
bill
of
lading
from
him
thou
wilt
take
thy
choice
of
my
gondolas
for
the
regatta
gino
observed
the
duke
of
sant
agata
entering
the
pavilion
and
throwing
himself
on
the
glossy
black
leathern
cushions
without
adverting
to
the
suggestion
of
his
servant
the
gondola
continued
its
noiseless
course
with
the
movement
peculiar
to
that
description
of
boat
gino
who
as
superior
over
his
fellow
stood
perched
on
the
little
arched
deck
in
the
stern
pushed
his
oar
with
accustomed
readiness
and
skill
now
causing
the
light
vessel
to
sheer
to
the
right
and
now
to
the
left
as
it
glided
among
the
multitude
of
craft
of
all
sizes
and
uses
which
it
met
in
its
passage
palace
after
palace
had
been
passed
and
more
than
one
of
the
principal
canals
which
diverged
towards
the
different
spectacles
or
the
other
places
of
resort
frequented
by
his
master
was
left
behind
without
don
camillo
giving
any
new
direction
at
length
the
boat
arrived
opposite
to
a
building
which
seemed
to
excite
more
than
common
expectation
giorgio
worked
his
oar
with
a
single
hand
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
gino
and
gino
permitted
his
blade
fairly
to
trail
on
the
water
both
seemed
to
await
new
orders
manifesting
something
like
that
species
of
instinctive
sympathy
with
him
they
served
which
a
long
practised
horse
is
apt
to
show
when
he
draws
near
a
gate
that
is
seldom
passed
unvisited
by
his
driver
the
edifice
which
caused
this
hesitation
in
the
two
gondoliers
was
one
of
those
residences
at
venice
which
are
quite
as
remarkable
for
their
external
riches
and
ornaments
as
for
their
singular
situation
amid
the
waters
a
massive
rustic
basement
of
marble
was
seated
as
solidly
in
the
element
as
if
it
grew
from
a
living
rock
while
story
was
seemingly
raised
on
story
in
the
wanton
observance
of
the
most
capricious
rules
of
meretricious
architecture
until
the
pile
reached
an
altitude
that
is
little
known
except
in
the
dwellings
of
princes
colonnades
medallions
and
massive
cornices
overhung
the
canal
as
if
the
art
of
man
had
taken
pride
in
loading
the
superstructure
in
a
manner
to
mock
the
unstable
element
which
concealed
its
base
a
flight
of
steps
on
which
each
gentle
undulation
produced
by
the
passage
of
the
barge
washed
a
wave
conducted
to
a
vast
vestibule
that
answered
many
of
the
purposes
of
a
court
two
or
three
gondolas
were
moored
near
but
the
absence
of
their
people
showed
they
were
for
the
use
of
those
who
dwelt
within
the
boats
were
protected
from
rough
collision
with
the
passing
craft
by
piles
driven
obliquely
into
the
bottom
similar
spars
with
painted
and
ornamented
heads
that
sometimes
bore
the
colors
and
arms
of
the
proprietor
formed
a
sort
of
little
haven
for
the
gondolas
of
the
household
before
the
door
of
every
dwelling
of
mark
where
is
it
the
pleasure
of
your
eccellenza
to
be
rowed
asked
gino
when
he
found
his
sympathetic
delay
had
produced
no
order
to
the
palazzo
giorgio
threw
a
glance
of
surprise
back
at
his
comrade
but
the
obedient
gondola
shot
by
the
gloomy
though
rich
abode
as
if
the
little
bark
had
suddenly
obeyed
an
inward
impulse
in
a
moment
more
it
whirled
aside
and
the
hollow
sound
caused
by
the
plash
of
water
between
high
walls
announced
its
entrance
into
a
narrower
canal
with
shortened
oars
the
men
still
urged
the
boat
ahead
now
turning
short
into
some
new
channel
now
glancing
beneath
a
low
bridge
and
now
uttering
in
the
sweet
shrill
tones
of
the
country
and
their
craft
the
well
known
warning
to
those
who
were
darting
in
an
opposite
direction
a
backstroke
of
gino
oar
however
soon
brought
the
side
of
the
arrested
boat
to
a
flight
of
steps
thou
wilt
follow
me
said
don
camillo
as
he
placed
his
foot
with
the
customary
caution
on
the
moist
stone
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
gino
i
have
need
of
thee
neither
the
vestibule
nor
the
entrance
nor
the
other
visible
accessories
of
the
dwelling
were
so
indicative
of
luxury
and
wealth
as
that
of
the
palace
on
the
great
canal
still
they
were
all
such
as
denoted
the
residence
of
a
noble
of
consideration
thou
wilt
do
wisely
gino
to
trust
thy
fortunes
to
the
new
gondola
said
the
master
as
he
mounted
the
heavy
stone
stairs
to
an
upper
floor
pointing
as
he
spoke
to
a
new
and
beautiful
boat
which
lay
in
a
corner
of
the
large
vestibule
as
carriages
are
seen
standing
in
the
courts
of
houses
built
on
more
solid
ground
he
who
would
find
favor
with
jupiter
must
put
his
own
shoulder
to
the
wheel
thou
knowest
my
friend
the
eye
of
gino
brightened
and
he
was
voluble
in
his
expression
of
thanks
they
had
ascended
to
the
first
floor
and
were
already
deep
in
a
suite
of
gloomy
apartments
before
the
gratitude
and
professional
pride
of
the
gondolier
were
exhausted
aided
by
a
powerful
arm
and
a
fleet
gondola
thy
chance
will
be
as
good
as
another
gino
said
don
camillo
closing
the
door
of
his
cabinet
on
his
servant
at
present
thou
mayest
give
some
proof
of
zeal
in
my
service
in
another
manner
is
the
face
of
a
man
called
jacopo
frontoni
known
to
thee
eccellenza
exclaimed
the
gondolier
gasping
for
breath
i
ask
thee
if
thou
knowest
the
countenance
of
one
named
frontoni
his
countenance
signore
by
what
else
thou
distinguish
a
man
a
man
signor
don
camillo
art
thou
mocking
thy
master
gino
i
have
asked
thee
if
thou
art
acquainted
with
the
person
of
a
certain
jacopo
frontoni
a
dweller
here
in
venice
eccellenza
yes
he
i
mean
has
been
long
remarked
by
the
misfortunes
of
his
family
the
father
being
now
in
exile
on
the
dalmatian
coast
or
elsewhere
eccellenza
yes
there
are
many
of
the
name
of
frontoni
and
it
is
important
that
thou
not
mistake
the
man
jacopo
of
that
family
is
a
youth
of
some
of
an
active
frame
and
melancholy
visage
and
of
less
vivacity
of
temperament
than
is
wont
at
his
years
eccellenza
yes
one
who
consorts
but
little
with
his
fellows
and
who
is
rather
noted
for
the
silence
and
industry
with
which
he
attends
to
his
concerns
than
for
any
of
the
usual
pleasantries
and
trifling
of
men
of
his
cast
a
certain
jacopo
frontoni
that
hath
his
abode
somewhere
near
the
arsenal
cospetto
signor
duca
the
man
is
as
well
known
to
us
gondoliers
as
the
bridge
of
the
rialto
your
eccellenza
has
no
need
to
trouble
yourself
to
describe
him
don
camillo
monforte
was
searching
among
the
papers
of
a
secretaire
he
raised
his
eyes
in
some
little
amazement
at
the
sally
of
his
dependant
and
then
he
quietly
resumed
his
occupation
if
thou
knowest
the
man
it
is
enough
eccellenza
yes
and
what
is
your
pleasure
with
this
accursed
jacopo
the
duke
of
sant
agata
seemed
to
recollect
himself
he
replaced
the
papers
which
had
been
deranged
and
he
closed
the
secretaire
gino
he
said
in
a
tone
of
confidence
and
amity
thou
wert
born
on
my
estates
though
so
long
trained
here
to
the
oar
in
venice
and
thou
hast
passed
thy
life
in
my
service
eccellenza
yes
it
is
my
desire
that
thou
end
thy
days
where
they
began
i
have
had
much
confidence
in
thy
discretion
hitherto
and
i
have
satisfaction
in
saying
it
has
never
failed
thee
notwithstanding
thou
hast
necessarily
been
a
witness
of
some
exploits
of
youth
which
might
have
drawn
embarrassment
on
thy
master
were
thy
tongue
less
disposed
to
silence
eccellenza
yes
don
camillo
smiled
but
the
gleam
of
humor
gave
way
to
a
look
of
grave
and
anxious
thought
as
thou
knowest
the
person
of
him
i
have
named
our
affair
is
simple
take
this
packet
he
continued
placing
a
sealed
letter
of
more
than
usual
size
into
the
hand
of
the
gondolier
and
drawing
from
his
finger
a
signet
ring
with
this
token
of
thy
authority
within
that
arch
of
the
doge
palace
which
leads
to
the
canal
of
san
marco
beneath
the
bridge
of
sighs
thou
wilt
find
jacopo
give
him
the
packet
and
should
he
demand
it
withhold
not
the
ring
wait
his
bidding
and
return
with
the
answer
gino
received
this
commission
with
profound
respect
but
with
an
awe
he
could
not
conceal
habitual
deference
to
his
master
appeared
to
struggle
with
deep
distaste
for
the
office
he
was
required
to
perform
and
there
was
even
some
manifestation
of
a
more
principled
reluctance
in
his
hesitating
yet
humble
manner
if
don
camillo
noted
the
air
and
countenance
of
his
menial
at
all
he
effectually
concealed
it
at
the
arched
passage
of
the
palace
beneath
the
bridge
of
sighs
he
coolly
added
and
let
thy
arrival
there
be
timed
as
near
as
may
be
to
the
first
hour
of
the
night
i
would
signore
that
you
had
been
pleased
to
command
giorgio
and
me
to
row
you
to
padua
the
way
is
long
why
this
sudden
wish
to
weary
thyself
because
there
is
no
doge
palace
nor
any
bridge
of
sighs
nor
any
dog
of
jacopo
frontoni
among
the
meadows
thou
hast
little
relish
for
this
duty
but
thou
must
know
that
what
the
master
commands
it
is
the
duty
of
a
faithful
follower
to
perform
thou
wert
born
my
vassal
gino
monaldi
and
though
trained
from
boyhood
in
this
occupation
of
a
gondolier
thou
art
properly
a
being
of
my
fiefs
in
napoli
gennaro
make
me
grateful
for
the
honor
signore
but
there
is
not
a
in
the
streets
of
venice
nor
a
mariner
on
her
canals
who
does
not
wish
this
jacopo
anywhere
but
in
the
bosom
of
abraham
he
is
the
terror
of
every
young
lover
and
of
all
the
urgent
creditors
on
the
islands
thou
seest
silly
babbler
there
is
one
of
the
former
at
least
who
does
not
hold
him
in
dread
thou
wilt
seek
him
beneath
the
bridge
of
sighs
and
showing
the
signet
deliver
the
package
according
to
my
instructions
it
is
certain
loss
of
character
to
be
seen
speaking
with
the
miscreant
so
lately
as
yesterday
i
heard
annina
the
pretty
daughter
of
the
old
on
the
lido
declare
that
to
be
seen
once
in
company
with
jacopo
frontoni
was
as
bad
as
to
be
caught
twice
bringing
old
rope
from
the
arsenal
as
befell
roderigo
her
mother
cousin
thy
distinctions
savor
of
the
morals
of
the
lido
remember
to
exhibit
the
ring
lest
he
distrust
thy
errand
could
not
your
eccellenza
set
me
about
clipping
the
wings
of
the
lion
or
painting
a
better
picture
than
tiziano
di
vecelli
i
have
a
mortal
dislike
even
to
pass
the
mere
compliments
of
the
day
with
one
of
your
were
any
of
our
gondoliers
to
see
me
in
discourse
with
the
man
it
might
exceed
your
eccellenza
influence
to
get
me
a
place
in
the
regatta
if
he
detain
thee
gino
thou
wilt
wait
his
pleasure
and
if
he
dismiss
thee
at
once
return
hither
with
all
expedition
that
i
may
know
the
result
i
very
well
know
signor
don
camillo
that
the
honor
of
a
noble
is
more
tender
of
reproach
than
that
of
his
followers
and
that
the
stain
upon
the
silken
robe
of
a
senator
is
seen
farther
than
the
spot
upon
a
velvet
jacket
if
any
one
unworthy
of
your
eccellenza
notice
has
dared
to
offend
here
are
giorgio
and
i
ready
at
any
time
to
show
how
deeply
we
can
feel
an
indignity
which
touches
our
master
credit
but
a
hireling
of
two
or
ten
or
even
of
a
hundred
sequins
i
thank
thee
for
the
hint
gino
go
thou
and
sleep
in
thy
gondola
and
bid
giorgio
come
into
my
cabinet
signore
art
thou
resolute
to
do
none
of
my
biddings
is
it
your
eccellenza
pleasure
that
i
go
to
the
bridge
of
sighs
by
the
footways
of
the
streets
or
by
the
canals
there
may
be
need
of
a
gondola
thou
wilt
go
with
the
oar
a
tumbler
shall
not
have
time
to
turn
round
before
the
answer
of
jacopo
shall
be
here
with
this
sudden
change
of
purpose
the
gondolier
quitted
the
room
for
the
reluctance
of
gino
disappeared
the
moment
he
found
the
confidential
duty
assigned
him
by
his
master
was
likely
to
be
performed
by
another
descending
rapidly
by
a
secret
stair
instead
of
entering
the
vestibule
where
half
a
dozen
menials
of
different
employments
were
in
waiting
he
passed
by
one
of
the
narrow
corridors
of
the
palace
into
an
inner
court
and
thence
by
a
low
and
unimportant
gate
into
an
obscure
alley
which
communicated
with
the
nearest
street
though
the
age
is
one
of
so
great
activity
and
intelligence
and
the
atlantic
is
no
longer
a
barrier
even
to
the
ordinary
amusements
of
life
a
great
majority
of
americans
have
never
had
an
opportunity
of
personally
examining
the
remarkable
features
of
a
region
of
which
the
town
that
gino
now
threaded
with
so
much
diligence
is
not
the
least
worthy
of
observation
those
who
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
have
visited
italy
therefore
will
excuse
us
if
we
make
a
brief
but
what
we
believe
useful
digression
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
have
not
had
that
advantage
the
city
of
venice
stands
on
a
cluster
of
low
sandy
islands
it
is
probable
that
the
country
which
lies
nearest
to
the
gulf
if
not
the
whole
of
the
immense
plain
of
lombardy
itself
is
of
alluvial
formation
whatever
may
have
been
the
origin
of
that
wide
and
fertile
kingdom
the
causes
which
have
given
to
the
lagunes
their
existence
and
to
venice
its
unique
and
picturesque
foundation
are
too
apparent
to
be
mistaken
several
torrents
which
flow
from
the
valleys
of
the
alps
pour
their
tribute
into
the
adriatic
at
this
point
their
waters
come
charged
with
the
débris
of
the
mountains
pulverized
nearly
to
their
original
elements
released
from
the
violence
of
the
stream
these
particles
have
necessarily
been
deposited
in
the
gulf
at
the
spot
where
they
have
first
become
subjected
to
the
power
of
the
sea
under
the
influence
of
counteracting
currents
eddies
and
waves
the
sands
have
been
thrown
into
submarine
piles
until
some
of
the
banks
have
arisen
above
the
surface
forming
islands
whose
elevation
has
been
gradually
augmented
by
the
decay
of
vegetation
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
that
while
the
gulf
of
venice
is
not
literally
it
is
practically
considered
with
reference
to
the
effect
produced
by
the
wind
called
the
sirocco
at
the
head
of
the
adriatic
this
accidental
circumstance
is
probably
the
reason
why
the
lagunes
have
a
more
determined
character
at
the
mouths
of
the
minor
streams
that
empty
themselves
here
than
at
the
mouths
of
most
of
the
other
rivers
which
equally
flow
from
the
alps
or
the
apennines
into
the
same
shallow
sea
the
natural
consequence
of
a
current
of
a
river
meeting
the
waters
of
any
broad
basin
and
where
there
is
no
base
of
rock
is
the
formation
at
or
near
the
spot
where
the
opposing
actions
are
neutralized
of
a
bank
which
is
technically
called
a
bar
the
coast
of
the
union
furnishes
constant
evidence
of
the
truth
of
this
theory
every
river
having
its
bar
with
channels
that
are
often
shifted
or
cleared
by
the
freshets
the
gales
or
the
tides
the
constant
and
powerful
operation
of
the
winds
on
one
side
with
the
periodical
increase
of
the
alpine
streams
on
the
other
have
converted
this
bar
at
the
entrance
of
the
venetian
lagunes
into
a
succession
of
long
low
sandy
islands
which
extend
in
a
direct
line
nearly
across
the
mouth
of
the
gulf
the
waters
of
the
rivers
have
necessarily
cut
a
few
channels
for
their
passage
or
what
is
now
a
lagune
would
long
since
have
become
a
lake
another
thousand
years
may
so
far
change
the
character
of
this
extraordinary
estuary
as
to
convert
the
channels
of
the
bay
into
rivers
and
the
muddy
banks
into
marshes
and
meadows
resembling
those
that
are
now
seen
for
so
many
leagues
inland
the
low
margin
of
sand
that
in
truth
gives
all
its
maritime
security
to
the
port
of
venice
and
the
lagunes
is
called
the
lido
di
palestrino
it
has
been
artificially
connected
and
secured
in
many
places
and
the
wall
of
the
lido
literally
the
beach
though
incomplete
like
most
of
the
great
and
vaunted
works
of
the
other
hemisphere
and
more
particularly
of
italy
ranks
with
the
mole
of
ancona
and
the
of
cherbourg
the
hundred
little
islands
which
now
contain
the
ruins
of
what
during
the
middle
ages
was
the
mart
of
the
mediterranean
are
grouped
together
within
of
the
natural
barrier
art
has
united
with
nature
to
turn
the
whole
to
good
account
and
apart
from
the
influence
of
moral
causes
the
rivalry
of
a
neighboring
town
which
has
been
fostered
by
political
care
and
the
gradual
filling
up
of
the
waters
by
the
constant
deposit
of
the
streams
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
commodious
or
a
safer
haven
when
entered
than
that
which
venice
affords
even
to
this
hour
as
all
the
deeper
channels
of
the
lagunes
have
been
preserved
the
city
is
intersected
in
every
direction
by
passages
which
from
their
appearance
are
called
canals
but
which
in
truth
are
no
more
than
so
many
small
natural
branches
of
the
sea
on
the
margin
of
these
passages
the
walls
of
the
dwellings
arise
literally
from
out
of
the
water
since
economy
of
room
has
caused
their
owners
to
extend
their
possessions
to
the
very
verge
of
the
channel
in
the
manner
that
quays
and
wharfs
are
pushed
into
the
streams
in
our
own
country
in
many
instances
the
islands
themselves
were
no
more
than
banks
which
were
periodically
bare
and
on
all
the
use
of
piles
has
been
necessary
to
support
the
superincumbent
loads
of
palaces
churches
and
public
monuments
under
which
in
the
course
of
ages
the
humble
spits
of
sand
have
been
made
to
groan
the
great
frequency
of
the
canals
and
perhaps
some
attention
to
economy
of
labor
has
given
to
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
buildings
the
facility
of
an
approach
by
water
but
while
nearly
every
dwelling
has
one
of
its
fronts
on
a
canal
there
are
always
communications
by
the
rear
with
the
interior
passages
of
the
town
it
is
a
fault
in
most
descriptions
that
while
the
stranger
hears
so
much
of
the
canals
of
venice
but
little
is
said
of
her
streets
still
narrow
paved
commodious
and
noiseless
passages
of
this
description
intersect
all
the
islands
which
communicate
with
each
other
by
means
of
a
countless
number
of
bridges
though
the
hoof
of
a
horse
or
the
rumbling
of
a
wheel
is
never
heard
in
these
strait
avenues
they
are
of
great
resort
for
all
the
purposes
of
ordinary
intercourse
gino
issued
into
one
of
these
thoroughfares
when
he
quitted
the
private
passage
which
communicated
with
the
palace
of
his
master
he
threaded
the
throng
by
which
it
was
crowded
with
a
dexterity
that
resembled
the
windings
of
an
eel
among
the
weeds
of
the
lagunes
to
the
numerous
greetings
of
his
fellows
he
replied
only
by
nods
nor
did
he
once
arrest
his
footsteps
until
they
had
led
him
through
the
door
of
a
low
and
dark
dwelling
that
stood
in
a
quarter
of
the
place
which
was
inhabited
by
people
of
an
inferior
condition
groping
his
way
among
casks
cordage
and
rubbish
of
all
descriptions
the
gondolier
succeeded
in
finding
an
inner
and
retired
door
that
opened
into
a
small
room
whose
only
light
came
from
a
species
of
well
that
descended
between
the
walls
of
the
adjacent
houses
and
that
in
which
he
was
blessed
anne

thou
gino

exclaimed
a
smart
venetian
grisette
whose
tone
and
manner
betrayed
as
much
of
coquetry
as
of
surprise
on
foot
and
by
the
secret
door
is
this
an
hour
to
come
on
any
of
thy
errands
truly
annina
it
is
not
the
season
for
affairs
with
thy
father
and
it
is
something
early
for
a
visit
to
thee
but
there
is
less
time
for
words
than
for
action
just
now
for
the
sake
of
san
teodoro
and
that
of
a
constant
and
silly
young
man
who
if
not
thy
slave
is
at

thy
dog

forth
the
jacket
i
wore
when
we
went
together
to
see

i
know
nothing
of
thy
errand

nor
of
thy
reason
for
wishing
to
change
thy
master
livery
for
the
dress
of
a
common
boatman
thou
art
far
more
comely
with
those
silken
flowers
than
in
this
faded
velveteen
and
if
i
have
ever
said
aught
in
commendation
of
its
appearance
it
was
because
we
were
bent
on
and
being
one
of
the
party
it
would
have
been
churlish
to
have
withheld
a
word
of
praise
to
a
companion
who
as
thou
knowest
does
not
dislike
a
civil
speech
in
his
own
praise

zitto
here
is
no

a
matter

lovest

had
not
neglected

moralized

motives

the

on

stool
that
stood
within
reach

he
made
this
strong
appeal
in
a
way
to
show
that

was
not
to
be
surprised
out
of
a
confession
of
this
sort
even
in

most
unguarded
moment
if
i
love
thee

thou
hast
the

search
in

all
about

this

the

little
frequented

entered
it

the

hesitated
a

having
seen
that
his
project

limited
ambition
like
other
men
and
among
the
strongest
of
the
former
was
the
desire
to
stand
well
in
the
favor
of
the
daughter
but
the
artful
girl
in
catering
to
his
palate
with
a
liquor
that
was
scarcely
less
celebrated
among
people
of
his
class
for
its
strength
than
its
flavor
had
caused
a
momentary
confusion
in
the
brain
of
gino
that
required
time
to
disperse
the
boat
was
in
the
grand
canal
and
far
on
its
way
to
the
place
of
its
destination
before
this
happy
purification
of
the
intellects
of
the
gondolier
had
been
sufficiently
effected
by
that
time
however
the
exercise
of
rowing
the
fresh
air
of
the
evening
and
the
sight
of
so
many
accustomed
objects
restored
his
faculties
to
the
necessary
degree
of
coolness
and
forethought
as
the
boat
approached
the
end
of
the
canal
he
began
to
cast
his
eyes
about
him
in
quest
of
the
well
known
felucca
of
the
calabrian
though
the
glory
of
venice
had
departed
the
trade
of
the
city
was
not
then
at
its
present
low
ebb
the
port
was
still
crowded
with
vessels
from
many
distant
havens
and
the
flags
of
most
of
the
maritime
states
of
europe
were
seen
at
intervals
within
the
barrier
of
the
lido
the
moon
was
now
sufficiently
high
to
cast
its
soft
light
on
the
whole
of
the
glittering
basin
and
a
forest
composed
of
lateen
yards
of
the
slender
masts
of
polaccas
and
of
the
more
massive
and
heavy
hamper
of
regularly
rigged
ships
was
to
be
seen
rising
above
the
tranquil
element
thou
art
no
judge
of
a
vessel
beauty
annina
said
the
gondolier
to
his
companion
who
was
deeply
housed
in
the
pavilion
of
the
boat
else
should
i
tell
thee
to
look
at
this
stranger
from
candia
is
said
that
a
fairer
model
has
never
entered
within
the
lido
than
that
same
greek
our
errand
is
not
with
the
candian
trader
gino
therefore
ply
thy
oar
for
time
passes
there
plenty
of
rough
greek
wine
in
his
hold
but
as
thou
sayest
we
have
naught
with
him
yon
tall
ship
which
is
moored
without
the
smaller
craft
of
our
seas
is
the
vessel
of
a
lutheran
from
the
islands
of
inghilterra
was
a
sad
day
for
the
republic
girl
when
it
first
permitted
the
stranger
to
come
into
the
waters
of
the
adriatic
is
it
certain
gino
that
the
arm
of
mark
was
strong
enough
to
keep
him
out
mother
of
diana
i
would
rather
thou
didst
not
ask
that
question
in
a
place
where
so
many
gondoliers
are
in
motion
here
are
ragusans
maltese
sicilians
and
tuscans
without
number
and
a
little
fleet
of
french
lie
near
each
other
there
at
the
entrance
of
the
giudecca
they
are
a
people
who
get
together
afloat
or
ashore
for
the
benefit
of
the
tongue
here
we
are
at
the
end
of
our
journey
the
oar
of
gino
gave
a
backward
sweep
and
the
gondola
was
at
rest
by
the
side
of
a
felucca
a
happy
night
to
the
bella
sorrentina
and
her
worthy
padrone
was
the
greeting
of
the
gondolier
as
he
put
his
foot
on
the
deck
of
the
vessel
is
the
honest
stefano
milano
on
board
the
swift
felucca
the
calabrian
was
not
slow
to
answer
and
in
a
few
moments
the
padrone
and
his
two
visitors
were
in
close
and
secret
conference
i
have
brought
one
here
who
will
be
likely
to
put
good
venetian
sequins
into
thy
pocket
caro
observed
the
gondolier
when
the
preliminaries
of
discourse
had
been
properly
observed
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
most
conscientious
who
is
quite
as
ready
at
transplanting
your
sicilian
grapes
into
the
islands
as
he
is
willing
and
able
to
pay
for
them
and
one
no
doubt
as
handsome
as
she
is
ready
said
the
mariner
with
blunt
gallantry
were
the
black
cloud
but
fairly
driven
from
before
her
face
a
mask
is
of
little
consequence
in
a
bargain
provided
the
money
be
forthcoming
we
are
always
in
the
carnival
at
venice
and
he
who
would
buy
or
he
who
would
sell
has
the
same
right
to
hide
his
face
as
to
hide
his
thoughts
what
hast
thou
in
the
way
of
forbidden
liquors
stefano
that
my
companion
may
not
lose
the
night
in
idle
words
per
diana
master
gino
thou
puttest
thy
questions
with
little
ceremony
the
hold
of
the
felucca
is
empty
as
thou
mayest
see
by
stepping
to
the
hatches
and
as
for
any
liquor
we
are
perishing
for
a
drop
to
warm
the
blood
and
so
far
from
coming
to
seek
it
here
said
annina
we
should
have
done
better
to
have
gone
into
the
cathedral
and
said
an
ave
for
thy
safe
voyage
home
and
now
that
our
wit
is
spent
we
will
quit
thee
friend
stefano
for
some
other
less
skilful
in
answers
cospetto
thou
knowest
not
what
thou
sayest
whispered
gino
when
he
found
that
the
wary
annina
was
not
disposed
to
remain
the
man
never
enters
the
meanest
creek
in
italy
without
having
something
useful
secreted
in
the
felucca
on
his
own
account
one
purchase
of
him
would
settle
the
question
between
the
quality
of
thy
father
wines
and
those
of
battista
there
is
not
a
gondolier
in
venice
but
will
resort
to
thy
shop
if
the
intercourse
with
this
fellow
can
be
fairly
settled
annina
hesitated
long
practised
in
the
small
but
secret
exceedingly
hazardous
commerce
which
her
father
notwithstanding
the
vigilance
and
severity
of
the
venetian
police
had
thus
far
successfully
driven
she
neither
liked
to
risk
an
exposure
of
her
views
to
an
utter
stranger
nor
to
abandon
a
bargain
that
promised
to
be
lucrative
that
gino
trifled
with
her
as
to
his
true
errand
needed
no
confirmation
since
a
servant
of
the
duke
of
sant
agata
was
not
likely
to
need
a
disguise
to
search
a
priest
but
she
knew
his
zeal
for
her
personal
welfare
too
well
to
distrust
his
faith
in
a
matter
that
concerned
her
own
safety
if
thou
distrust
that
any
here
are
the
spies
of
the
authorities
she
observed
to
the
padrone
with
a
manner
that
readily
betrayed
her
wishes
it
will
be
in
gino
power
to
undeceive
thee
thou
wilt
testify
gino
that
i
am
not
to
be
suspected
of
treachery
in
an
affair
like
this
leave
me
to
put
a
word
into
the
private
ear
of
the
calabrian
said
the
gondolier
stefano
milano
if
thou
love
me
he
continued
when
they
were
a
little
apart
keep
the
girl
in
parley
and
treat
with
her
fairly
for
thy
adventure
shall
i
sell
the
vintage
of
don
camillo
or
that
of
the
viceroy
of
sicily
caro
there
is
as
much
wine
of
each
on
board
the
bella
sorrentina
as
would
float
the
fleet
of
the
republic
if
in
truth
thou
art
dry
then
feign
that
thou
hast
it
and
differ
in
thy
prices
entertain
her
but
a
minute
with
fair
words
while
i
can
get
unseen
into
my
gondola
and
then
for
the
sake
of
an
old
and
tried
friend
put
her
tenderly
on
the
quay
in
the
best
manner
thou
art
able
i
begin
to
see
into
the
nature
of
the
trade
returned
the
pliant
padrone
placing
a
finger
on
the
side
of
his
nose
i
will
discourse
the
woman
by
the
hour
about
the
flavor
of
the
liquor
or
if
thou
wilt
of
her
own
beauty
but
to
squeeze
a
drop
of
anything
better
than
the
water
of
the
lagunes
out
of
the
ribs
of
the
felucca
would
be
a
miracle
worthy
of
san
teodoro
there
is
but
little
need
to
touch
on
aught
but
the
quality
of
thy
wine
the
girl
is
not
like
most
of
her
sex
and
she
takes
sudden
offence
when
there
is
question
of
her
appearance
indeed
the
mask
she
wears
is
as
much
to
hide
a
face
that
has
little
to
tempt
the
eye
as
from
any
wish
at
concealment
since
gino
has
entered
frankly
into
the
matter
resumed
the
calabrian
cheerfully
and
with
an
air
of
sudden
confidence
to
the
expectant
annina
i
begin
to
see
more
probability
of
our
understanding
each
other
meaning
deign
bella
donna
to
go
into
my
poor
cabin
where
we
will
speak
more
at
our
ease
and
something
more
to
our
mutual
profit
and
mutual
security
annina
was
not
without
secret
doubts
but
she
suffered
the
padrone
to
lead
her
to
the
stairs
of
the
cabin
as
if
she
were
disposed
to
descend
her
back
was
no
sooner
turned
than
gino
slid
into
the
gondola
which
one
shove
of
his
vigorous
arm
sent
far
beyond
the
leap
of
man
the
action
was
sudden
rapid
and
noiseless
but
the
jealous
eye
of
annina
detected
the
escape
of
the
gondolier
though
not
in
time
to
prevent
it
without
betraying
uneasiness
she
submitted
to
be
led
below
as
if
the
whole
were
done
by
previous
concert
gino
has
said
that
you
have
a
boat
which
will
do
the
friendly
office
to
put
me
on
the
quay
when
our
conference
is
over
she
remarked
with
a
presence
of
mind
that
luckily
met
the
expedient
of
her
late
companion
the
felucca
itself
should
do
that
much
were
there
want
of
other
means
gallantly
returned
the
manner
when
they
disappeared
in
the
cabin
free
to
discharge
his
duty
gino
now
plied
his
task
with
redoubled
zeal
the
light
boat
glided
among
the
vessels
inclining
by
the
skilful
management
of
his
single
oar
in
a
manner
to
avoid
all
collision
until
it
entered
the
narrow
canal
which
separates
the
palace
of
the
doge
from
the
more
beautiful
and
classic
structure
that
contains
the
prisons
of
the
republic
the
bridge
which
continues
the
communication
of
the
quays
was
first
passed
and
then
he
was
stealing
beneath
that
arch
which
supports
a
covered
gallery
leading
from
the
upper
story
of
the
palace
into
that
of
the
prisons
and
which
from
its
being
appropriated
to
the
passage
of
the
accused
from
their
cells
to
the
presence
of
their
judges
has
been
so
poetically
and
it
may
be
added
so
pathetically
called
the
bridge
of
sighs
the
oar
of
gino
now
relaxed
its
efforts
and
the
gondola
approached
a
flight
of
steps
over
which
as
usual
the
water
cast
its
little
waves
stepping
on
the
lowest
flag
he
thrust
a
small
iron
spike
to
which
a
cord
was
attached
into
a
crevice
between
two
of
the
stones
and
left
his
boat
to
the
security
of
this
characteristic
fastening
when
this
little
precaution
was
observed
the
gondolier
passed
up
lightly
beneath
the
massive
arch
of
the
of
the
palace
and
entered
its
large
but
gloomy
court
at
that
hour
and
with
the
temptation
of
the
gay
scene
which
offered
in
the
adjoining
square
the
place
was
nearly
deserted
a
single
female
was
at
the
well
waiting
for
the
element
to
filter
into
its
basin
in
order
to
fill
her
buckets
while
her
ear
listened
in
dull
attention
to
the
hum
of
the
moving
crowd
without
a
halberdier
paced
the
open
gallery
at
the
head
of
the
giant
stairs
and
here
and
there
the
footfall
of
other
sentinels
might
be
heard
among
the
hollow
and
ponderous
arches
of
the
long
corridors
no
light
was
shed
from
the
windows
but
the
entire
building
presented
a
fit
emblem
of
that
mysterious
power
which
was
known
to
preside
over
the
fortunes
of
venice
and
her
citizens
ere
gino
trusted
himself
without
the
shadow
of
the
passage
by
which
he
had
entered
two
or
three
curious
faces
had
appeared
at
the
opposite
entrance
of
the
court
where
they
paused
a
moment
to
gaze
at
the
melancholy
and
imposing
air
of
the
dreaded
palace
before
they
vanished
in
the
throng
which
trifled
in
the
immediate
proximity
of
that
secret
and
ruthless
tribunal
as
man
riots
in
security
even
on
the
verge
of
an
endless
and
unforeseen
future
disappointed
in
his
expectation
of
meeting
him
he
sought
on
the
instant
the
gondolier
advanced
and
taking
courage
by
the
possibility
of
his
escaping
altogether
from
the
interview
he
ventured
to
furnish
audible
evidence
of
his
presence
by
a
loud
hem
at
that
instant
a
figure
glided
into
the
court
from
the
side
of
the
quay
and
walked
swiftly
towards
its
centre
the
heart
of
gino
beat
violently
but
he
mustered
resolution
to
meet
the
stranger
as
they
drew
near
each
other
it
became
evident
by
the
light
of
the
moon
which
penetrated
even
to
that
gloomy
spot
that
the
latter
was
also
masked
san
teodoro
and
san
marco
have
you
in
mind
commenced
the
gondolier
if
i
mistake
not
you
are
the
man
i
am
sent
to
meet
the
stranger
started
and
first
manifesting
an
intention
to
pass
on
quickly
he
suddenly
arrested
the
movement
to
reply
this
may
be
so
or
not
unmask
that
i
may
judge
by
thy
countenance
if
what
thou
sayest
be
true
by
your
good
leave
most
worthy
and
honorable
signore
and
if
it
be
equally
agreeable
to
you
and
my
master
i
would
choose
to
keep
off
the
evening
air
by
this
bit
of
pasteboard
and
silk
here
are
none
to
betray
thee
wert
thou
naked
as
at
thy
birth
unless
certain
of
thy
character
in
what
manner
may
i
confide
in
thy
honesty
i
have
no
distrust
of
the
virtues
of
an
undisguised
face
signore
and
therefore
do
i
invite
you
yourself
to
exhibit
what
nature
has
done
for
you
in
the
way
of
features
that
i
who
am
to
make
the
confidence
be
sure
it
be
to
the
right
person
this
is
well
and
gives
assurance
of
thy
prudence
i
may
not
unmask
however
and
as
there
seemeth
little
probability
of
our
coming
to
an
understanding
i
will
go
my
way
a
most
happy
night
to
thee
cospetto
signore
you
are
far
too
quick
in
your
ideas
and
movements
for
one
little
used
to
negotiations
of
this
sort
here
is
a
ring
whose
signet
may
help
us
to
understand
each
other
the
stranger
took
the
jewel
and
holding
the
stone
in
a
manner
to
receive
the
light
of
the
moon
he
started
in
a
manner
to
betray
both
surprise
and
pleasure
this
is
the
falcon
crest
of
the
neapolitan
he
that
is
the
lord
of
sant
agata
and
of
many
other
fiefs
good
signore
to
say
nothing
of
the
honors
he
claims
in
venice
am
i
right
in
supposing
my
errand
with
you
thou
hast
found
one
whose
present
business
has
no
other
object
than
don
camillo
monforte
but
thy
errand
was
not
solely
to
exhibit
the
signet
so
little
so
that
i
have
a
packet
here
which
waits
only
for
a
certainty
of
the
person
with
whom
i
speak
to
be
placed
into
his
hands
the
stranger
mused
a
moment
then
glancing
a
look
about
him
he
answered
hurriedly
this
is
no
place
to
unmask
friend
even
though
we
only
wear
our
disguises
in
pleasantry
tarry
here
and
at
my
return
i
will
conduct
thee
to
a
more
fitting
spot
the
words
were
scarcely
uttered
when
gino
found
himself
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
court
alone
the
masked
stranger
had
passed
swiftly
on
and
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
giant
stairs
ere
the
gondolier
had
time
for
reflection
he
ascended
with
a
light
and
rapid
step
and
without
regarding
the
halberdier
he
approached
the
first
of
three
or
four
orifices
which
opened
into
the
wall
of
the
palace
and
which
from
the
heads
of
the
animal
being
carved
in
relief
around
them
had
become
famous
as
the
receptacles
of
secret
accusations
under
the
name
of
the
lion
mouths
something
he
dropped
into
the
grinning
aperture
of
the
marble
though
what
the
distance
and
the
obscurity
of
the
gallery
prevented
gino
from
perceiving
and
then
his
form
was
seen
gliding
like
a
phantom
down
the
flight
of
massive
steps
gino
had
retired
towards
the
arch
of
the
in
expectation
that
the
stranger
would
rejoin
him
within
its
shadows
but
to
his
great
alarm
he
saw
the
form
darting
through
the
outer
portal
of
the
palace
into
the
square
of
mark
it
was
not
a
moment
ere
gino
breathless
with
haste
was
in
chase
on
reaching
the
bright
and
gay
scene
of
the
piazza
which
contrasted
with
the
gloomy
court
he
had
just
quitted
like
morning
with
night
he
saw
the
utter
fruitlessness
of
further
pursuit
frightened
at
the
loss
of
his
master
signet
however
the
indiscreet
but
well
intentioned
gondolier
rushed
into
the
crowd
and
tried
in
vain
to
select
the
delinquent
from
among
a
thousand
masks
harkee
signore
uttered
the
gondolier
to
one
who
having
first
examined
his
person
with
distrust
evidently
betrayed
a
wish
to
avoid
him
if
thou
hast
sufficiently
pleased
thy
finger
with
my
master
signet
the
occasion
offers
to
return
it
i
know
thee
not
returned
a
voice
in
which
gino
ear
could
detect
no
familiar
sound
it
may
not
be
well
to
trifle
with
the
displeasure
of
a
noble
as
powerful
as
him
you
know
he
whispered
at
the
elbow
of
another
who
had
come
under
his
suspicions
the
signet
if
thou
pleasest
and
the
affair
need
go
no
further
he
who
would
meddle
in
it
with
or
without
that
gage
would
do
well
to
pause
the
gondolier
again
turned
away
disappointed
the
ring
is
not
suited
to
thy
masquerade
friend
of
mine
he
essayed
with
a
third
and
it
would
be
wise
not
to
trouble
the
podestà
about
such
a
trifle
then
name
it
not
lest
he
hear
thee
the
answer
proved
like
all
the
others
unsatisfactory
and
bootless
gino
now
ceased
to
question
any
but
he
threaded
the
throng
with
an
active
and
eager
eye
fifty
times
was
he
tempted
to
speak
but
as
often
did
some
difference
in
stature
or
dress
some
laugh
or
trifle
uttered
in
levity
warn
him
of
his
mistake
he
penetrated
to
the
very
head
of
the
piazza
and
returning
by
the
opposite
side
he
found
his
way
through
the
throng
of
the
porticoes
looking
into
every
and
examining
each
figure
that
floated
by
until
he
again
issued
into
the
piazzetta
without
success
a
slight
jerk
at
the
elbow
of
his
jacket
arrested
his
steps
and
he
turned
to
look
at
the
person
who
had
detained
him
a
female
attired
like
a
contadina
addressed
him
in
the
feigned
voice
common
to
all
whither
so
fast
and
what
hast
thou
lost
in
this
merry
crowd
if
a
heart
be
wise
to
use
diligence
for
many
here
may
be
willing
to
wear
the
jewel
corpo
di
bacco
exclaimed
the
disappointed
gondolier
any
who
find
such
a
bauble
of
mine
under
foot
are
welcome
to
their
luck
hast
thou
seen
a
domino
of
a
size
like
that
of
any
other
man
with
a
gait
that
might
pass
for
the
step
of
a
senator
padre
or
jew
and
a
mask
that
looks
as
much
like
a
thousand
of
these
in
the
square
as
one
side
of
the
campanile
is
like
the
other
thy
picture
is
so
well
drawn
that
one
can
not
fail
to
know
the
original
he
stands
beside
thee
gino
wheeled
suddenly
and
saw
that
a
grinning
harlequin
was
playing
his
antics
in
the
place
where
he
had
expected
to
find
the
stranger
and
thy
eyes
bella
contadina
are
as
dull
as
a
mole
he
ceased
speaking
for
deceived
in
his
person
she
who
had
saluted
him
was
no
longer
visible
in
this
manner
did
the
disappointed
gondolier
thread
his
way
towards
the
water
now
answering
to
the
boisterous
salute
of
some
clown
and
now
repelling
the
advances
of
females
less
disguised
than
the
pretended
contadina
until
he
gained
a
space
near
the
quays
where
there
was
more
room
for
observation
here
he
paused
undetermined
whether
to
return
and
confess
his
indiscretion
to
his
master
or
whether
he
should
make
still
another
effort
to
regain
the
ring
which
had
been
so
sillily
lost
the
vacant
space
between
the
two
granite
columns
was
left
to
the
quiet
possession
of
himself
and
one
other
who
stood
near
the
base
of
that
which
sustained
the
lion
of
mark
as
motionless
as
if
he
too
were
merely
a
form
of
stone
two
or
three
stragglers
either
led
by
idle
curiosity
or
expecting
to
meet
one
appointed
to
await
their
coming
drew
near
this
immovable
man
but
all
glided
away
as
if
there
were
repulsion
in
his
countenance
gino
had
witnessed
several
instances
of
this
evident
dislike
to
remain
near
the
unknown
figure
ere
he
felt
induced
to
cross
the
space
between
them
in
order
to
inquire
into
its
cause
a
slow
movement
at
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
brought
the
rays
of
the
moon
full
upon
the
calm
countenance
and
searching
eye
of
the
very
man
he
sought
the
first
impulse
of
the
gondolier
like
that
of
all
the
others
he
had
seen
approach
the
spot
was
to
retreat
but
the
recollection
of
his
errand
and
his
loss
came
in
season
to
prevent
such
an
exhibition
of
his
disgust
and
alarm
still
he
did
not
speak
but
he
met
the
riveted
gaze
of
the
bravo
with
a
look
that
denoted
equally
confusion
of
intellect
and
a
purpose
thou
aught
with
me
demanded
jacopo
when
the
gaze
of
each
had
continued
beyond
the
term
of
accidental
glances
my
master
signet
i
know
thee
not
that
image
of
san
teodoro
could
testify
that
this
is
holy
truth
if
it
would
but
speak
i
have
not
the
honor
of
your
friendship
signor
jacopo
but
one
may
have
affairs
even
with
a
stranger
if
you
met
a
peaceable
and
innocent
gondolier
in
the
court
of
the
palace
since
the
clock
of
the
piazza
told
the
last
quarter
and
got
from
him
a
ring
which
can
be
of
but
little
use
to
any
but
its
rightful
owner
one
so
generous
will
not
hesitate
to
return
it
dost
thou
take
me
for
a
jeweller
of
the
rialto
that
thou
speakest
to
me
of
rings
i
take
you
for
one
well
known
and
much
valued
by
many
of
name
and
quality
here
in
venice
as
witness
my
errand
from
my
own
master
remove
thy
mask
men
of
fair
dealing
need
not
hide
the
features
which
nature
has
given
them
you
speak
nothing
but
truths
signor
frontoni
which
is
little
remarkable
considering
thy
opportunities
of
looking
into
the
motives
of
men
there
is
little
in
my
face
to
pay
you
for
the
trouble
of
casting
a
glance
at
it
i
would
as
lief
do
as
others
in
this
gay
season
if
it
be
equally
agreeable
to
you
do
as
thou
wilt
but
i
pray
thee
to
give
me
the
same
permission
there
are
few
so
bold
as
to
dispute
thy
pleasure
signore
it
is
to
be
alone
cospetto
there
is
not
a
man
in
venice
who
would
more
gladly
consult
it
if
my
master
errand
were
fairly
done
muttered
gino
between
his
teeth
i
have
here
a
packet
which
it
is
my
duty
to
put
into
your
hands
signore
and
into
those
of
no
other
i
know
thee
not
thou
hast
a
name
not
in
the
sense
in
which
you
speak
signore
as
to
that
sort
of
reputation
i
am
as
nameless
as
a
foundling
if
thy
master
is
of
no
more
note
than
thyself
the
packet
may
be
returned
there
are
few
within
the
dominions
of
mark
of
better
lineage
or
of
fairer
hopes
than
the
duke
of
sant
agata
the
cold
expression
of
the
bravo
countenance
changed
if
thou
comest
from
don
camillo
monforte
why
dost
thou
hesitate
to
proclaim
it
where
are
his
requests
i
know
not
whether
it
is
his
pleasure
or
that
of
another
which
this
paper
contains
but
such
as
it
is
signor
jacopo
my
duty
commands
me
to
deliver
it
to
thee
the
packet
was
received
calmly
though
the
organ
which
glanced
at
its
seal
and
its
superscription
gleamed
with
an
expression
which
the
credulous
gondolier
fancied
to
resemble
that
of
the
tiger
at
the
sight
of
blood
thou
something
of
a
ring
dost
thou
bear
thy
master
signet
i
am
much
accustomed
to
see
pledges
ere
i
give
faith
blessed
san
teodore
grant
that
i
did
were
it
as
heavy
as
a
skin
of
wine
i
would
willingly
bear
the
load
but
one
that
i
mistook
for
you
master
jacopo
has
it
on
his
own
light
finger
i
fear
this
is
an
affair
that
thou
wilt
settle
with
thy
master
returned
the
bravo
coldly
again
examining
the
impression
of
the
seal
if
you
are
acquainted
with
the
writing
of
my
master
hurriedly
remarked
gino
who
trembled
for
the
fate
of
the
packet
you
will
see
his
skill
in
the
turn
of
those
letters
there
are
few
nobles
in
venice
or
indeed
in
the
sicilies
who
have
a
more
scholarly
hand
with
a
quill
than
don
camillo
monforte
i
could
not
do
the
thing
half
so
well
myself
i
am
no
clerk
observed
the
bravo
without
betraying
shame
at
the
confession
the
art
of
deciphering
a
scroll
like
this
was
never
taught
me
if
thou
art
so
expert
in
the
skill
of
a
penman
tell
me
the
name
the
packet
bears
little
become
me
to
breathe
a
syllable
concerning
any
of
my
master
secrets
returned
the
gondolier
drawing
himself
up
in
sudden
reserve
it
is
enough
that
he
bid
me
deliver
the
letter
after
which
i
should
think
it
presumption
even
to
whisper
more
the
dark
eye
of
the
bravo
was
seen
rolling
over
the
person
of
his
companion
by
the
light
of
the
moon
in
a
manner
that
caused
the
blood
of
the
latter
to
steal
towards
his
heart
i
bid
thee
read
to
me
aloud
the
name
the
paper
bears
said
jacopo
sternly
here
is
none
but
the
lion
and
the
saint
above
our
heads
to
listen
just
san
marco
who
can
tell
what
ear
is
open
or
what
ear
is
shut
in
venice
if
you
please
signor
frontoni
we
will
postpone
the
examination
to
a
more
suitable
occasion
friend
i
do
not
play
the
fool
the
name
or
show
me
some
gage
that
thou
art
sent
by
him
thou
hast
named
else
take
back
the
packet
is
no
affair
for
my
hand
reflect
a
single
moment
on
the
consequences
signor
jacopo
before
you
come
to
a
determination
so
hasty
i
know
no
consequences
which
can
befall
a
man
who
refuses
to
receive
a
message
like
this
per
diana
signore
the
duca
will
not
be
likely
to
leave
me
an
ear
to
hear
the
good
advice
of
father
battista
then
will
the
duca
save
the
public
executioner
some
trouble
as
he
spoke
the
bravo
cast
the
packet
at
the
feet
of
the
gondolier
and
began
to
walk
calmly
up
the
piazzetta
gino
seized
the
letter
and
with
his
brain
in
a
whirl
with
the
effort
to
recall
some
one
of
his
acquaintances
to
whom
he
would
be
likely
to
address
an
epistle
on
such
an
occasion
he
followed
i
wonder
signor
jacopo
that
a
man
of
your
sagacity
has
not
remembered
that
a
packet
to
be
delivered
to
himself
should
bear
his
own
name
the
bravo
took
the
paper
and
held
the
superscription
again
to
the
light
that
is
not
so
though
unlearned
necessity
has
taught
me
to
know
when
i
am
meant
diamine
that
is
just
my
own
case
signore
were
the
letter
for
me
now
the
old
should
not
know
its
young
quicker
than
i
would
come
at
the
truth
then
thou
canst
not
read
i
never
pretended
to
the
art
the
little
said
was
merely
about
writing
learning
as
you
well
understand
master
jacopo
is
divided
into
reading
writing
and
figures
and
a
man
may
well
understand
one
without
knowing
a
word
of
the
others
it
is
not
absolutely
necessary
to
be
a
bishop
to
have
a
shaved
head
or
a
jew
to
wear
a
beard
thou
have
done
better
to
have
said
this
at
once
go
i
will
think
of
the
matter
gino
gladly
turned
away
but
he
had
not
left
the
other
many
paces
before
he
saw
a
female
form
gliding
behind
the
pedestal
of
one
of
the
granite
columns
moving
swiftly
in
a
direction
to
uncover
this
seeming
spy
he
saw
at
once
that
annina
had
been
a
witness
of
his
interview
with
the
bravo
chapter
iv
will
make
me
think
the
world
is
full
of
rubs
and
that
my
fortune
runs
the
bias
richard
the
second
though
venice
at
that
hour
was
so
gay
in
her
squares
the
rest
of
the
town
was
silent
as
the
grave
a
city
in
which
the
hoof
of
horse
or
the
rolling
of
wheels
is
never
heard
necessarily
possesses
a
character
of
its
own
but
the
peculiar
form
of
the
government
and
the
long
training
of
the
people
in
habits
of
caution
weighed
on
the
spirits
of
the
gay
there
were
times
and
places
it
is
true
when
the
buoyancy
of
youthful
blood
and
the
levity
of
the
thoughtless
found
occasion
for
their
display
nor
were
they
rare
but
when
men
found
themselves
removed
from
the
temptation
and
perhaps
from
the
support
of
society
they
appeared
to
imbibe
the
character
of
their
sombre
city
such
was
the
state
of
most
of
the
town
while
the
scene
described
in
the
previous
chapter
was
exhibited
in
the
lively
piazza
of
san
marco
the
moon
had
risen
so
high
that
its
light
fell
between
the
range
of
walls
here
and
there
touching
the
surface
of
the
water
to
which
it
imparted
a
quivering
brightness
while
the
domes
and
towers
rested
beneath
its
light
in
a
solemn
but
grand
repose
occasionally
the
front
of
a
palace
received
the
rays
on
its
heavy
cornices
and
labored
columns
the
gloomy
stillness
of
the
interior
of
the
edifice
furnishing
in
every
such
instance
a
striking
contrast
to
the
richness
and
architectural
beauty
without
our
narrative
now
leads
us
to
one
of
these
patrician
abodes
of
the
first
class
a
heavy
magnificence
pervaded
the
style
of
the
dwelling
the
vestibule
was
vast
vaulted
and
massive
the
stairs
rich
in
marbles
heavy
and
grand
the
apartments
were
imposing
in
their
gildings
and
sculpture
while
the
walls
sustained
countless
works
on
which
the
highest
geniuses
of
italy
had
lavishly
diffused
their
power
among
these
relics
of
an
age
more
happy
in
this
respect
than
that
of
which
we
write
the
connoisseur
would
readily
have
known
the
pencils
of
titian
paul
veronese
and
tintoretto
the
three
great
names
in
which
the
subjects
of
mark
so
justly
prided
themselves
among
these
works
of
the
higher
masters
were
mingled
others
by
the
pencils
of
bellino
and
montegna
and
palma
vecchio
artists
who
were
secondary
only
to
the
more
renowned
colorists
of
the
venetian
school
vast
sheets
of
mirrors
lined
the
walls
wherever
the
still
more
precious
paintings
had
no
place
while
the
ordinary
hangings
of
velvet
and
silk
became
objects
of
secondary
admiration
in
a
scene
of
nearly
royal
magnificence
the
cool
and
beautiful
floors
made
of
a
composition
in
which
all
the
prized
marbles
of
italy
and
of
the
east
polished
to
the
last
degree
of
art
were
curiously
embedded
formed
a
suitable
finish
to
a
style
so
gorgeous
and
in
which
luxury
and
taste
were
blended
in
equal
profusion
the
building
which
on
two
of
its
sides
literally
rose
from
out
the
water
was
as
usual
erected
around
a
dark
court
following
its
different
faces
the
eye
might
penetrate
by
many
a
door
open
at
that
hour
for
the
passage
of
the
air
from
off
the
sea
through
long
suites
of
rooms
furnished
and
fitted
in
the
manner
described
all
lighted
by
shaded
lamps
that
spread
a
soft
and
gentle
glow
around
passing
without
notice
ranges
of
reception
and
sleeping
rooms
the
latter
of
a
magnificence
to
mock
the
ordinary
wants
of
the
body
we
shall
at
once
introduce
the
reader
into
the
part
of
the
palace
where
the
business
of
the
tale
conducts
us
at
the
angle
of
the
dwelling
on
the
side
of
the
smaller
of
the
two
canals
and
most
remote
from
the
principal
of
the
city
on
which
the
edifice
fronted
there
was
a
suite
of
apartments
which
while
it
exhibited
the
same
style
of
luxury
and
magnificence
as
those
first
mentioned
in
its
general
character
discovered
greater
attention
in
its
details
to
the
wants
of
ordinary
life
the
hangings
were
of
the
richest
velvets
or
of
glossy
silks
the
mirrors
were
large
and
of
exquisite
truth
the
floors
of
the
same
gay
and
pleasing
colors
and
the
walls
were
adorned
with
their
appropriate
works
of
art
but
the
whole
was
softened
down
to
a
picture
of
domestic
comfort
the
tapestries
and
curtains
hung
in
careless
folds
the
beds
admitted
of
sleep
and
the
pictures
were
delicate
copies
by
the
pencil
of
some
youthful
amateur
whose
leisure
had
been
exercised
in
this
gentle
and
feminine
employment
the
fair
being
herself
whose
early
instruction
had
given
birth
to
so
many
skilful
imitations
of
the
divine
expression
of
raphael
or
to
the
vivid
tints
of
titian
was
at
that
hour
in
her
privacy
discoursing
with
her
ghostly
adviser
and
one
of
her
own
sex
who
had
long
discharged
the
joint
trusts
of
instructor
and
parent
the
years
of
the
lady
of
the
palace
were
so
tender
that
in
a
more
northern
region
she
would
scarcely
have
been
deemed
past
the
period
of
childhood
though
in
her
native
land
the
justness
and
maturity
of
her
form
and
the
expression
of
a
dark
eloquent
eye
indicated
both
the
growth
and
the
intelligence
of
womanhood
for
this
good
counsel
i
thank
you
my
father
and
my
excellent
donna
florinda
will
thank
you
still
more
for
your
opinions
are
so
like
her
own
that
i
sometimes
admire
the
secret
means
by
which
experience
enables
the
wise
and
the
good
to
think
so
much
alike
on
a
matter
of
so
little
personal
interest
a
slight
but
furtive
smile
struggled
around
the
mortified
mouth
of
the
carmelite
as
he
listened
to
the
naive
observation
of
his
ingenuous
pupil
thou
wilt
learn
my
child
he
answered
as
time
heaps
wisdom
on
thy
head
that
it
is
in
concerns
which
touch
our
passions
and
interests
least
we
are
most
apt
to
decide
with
discretion
and
impartiality
though
donna
florinda
is
not
yet
past
the
age
when
the
heart
is
finally
subdued
and
there
is
still
so
much
to
bind
her
to
the
world
she
will
assure
thee
of
this
truth
or
i
greatly
mistake
the
excellence
of
that
mind
which
hath
hitherto
led
her
so
far
blameless
in
this
erring
pilgrimage
to
which
we
are
all
doomed
though
the
cowl
was
over
the
head
of
the
speaker
who
was
evidently
preparing
to
depart
and
his
eye
never
varied
from
its
friendly
look
at
the
fair
face
of
her
he
instructed
the
blood
stole
into
the
pale
cheeks
of
the
maternal
companion
and
her
whole
countenance
betrayed
some
such
reflection
of
feeling
at
his
praise
as
a
wintry
sky
exhibits
at
a
sudden
gleam
from
the
setting
sun
i
trust
that
violetta
does
not
now
hear
this
for
the
first
time
observed
donna
florinda
in
a
voice
so
meek
and
tremulous
as
to
be
observed
little
that
can
be
profitably
told
one
of
my
inexperience
has
been
left
untaught
quickly
answered
the
pupil
unconscious
herself
that
she
reached
her
hand
towards
that
of
her
constant
monitor
though
too
intent
on
her
object
to
change
her
look
from
the
features
of
the
carmelite
but
why
this
desire
in
the
senate
to
dispose
of
a
girl
who
would
be
satisfied
to
live
for
ever
as
she
is
now
happy
in
her
youth
and
contented
with
the
privacy
which
becomes
her
sex
the
relentless
years
will
not
stay
their
advance
that
even
one
innocent
as
thou
may
never
know
the
unhappiness
and
trials
of
a
more
mature
age
this
life
is
one
of
imperious
and
oftentimes
of
tyrannical
duties
thou
art
not
ignorant
of
the
policy
that
rules
a
state
which
hath
made
its
name
so
illustrious
by
high
deeds
in
arms
its
riches
and
its
influence
there
is
a
law
in
venice
which
commandeth
that
none
claiming
an
interest
in
its
affairs
shall
so
bind
himself
to
the
stranger
as
to
endanger
the
devotion
all
owe
to
the
republic
thus
may
not
the
patrician
of
mark
be
a
lord
in
other
lands
nor
may
the
heiress
of
a
name
great
and
valued
as
thine
be
given
in
marriage
to
any
of
note
in
a
foreign
state
without
counsel
and
consent
from
those
who
are
appointed
to
watch
over
the
interests
of
all
had
providence
cast
my
lot
in
an
humbler
class
this
would
not
have
been
methinks
it
ill
comports
with
the
happiness
of
woman
to
be
the
especial
care
of
the
council
of
ten
there
is
indiscretion
and
i
lament
to
say
impiety
in
thy
words
our
duty
bids
us
submit
to
earthly
laws
and
more
than
duty
reverence
teaches
us
not
to
repine
at
the
will
of
providence
but
i
do
not
see
the
weight
of
this
grievance
against
which
thou
murmurest
daughter
thou
art
youthful
wealthy
beyond
the
indulgence
of
all
healthful
desires
of
a
lineage
to
excite
an
unwholesome
worldly
pride
and
fair
enough
to
render
thee
the
most
dangerous
of
thine
own
enemies
and
thou
repinest
at
a
lot
to
which
all
of
thy
sex
and
station
are
of
necessity
subject
for
the
offence
against
providence
i
am
already
a
penitent
returned
the
donna
violetta
but
surely
it
would
be
less
embarrassing
to
a
girl
of
sixteen
were
the
fathers
of
the
state
so
much
occupied
with
more
weighty
affairs
as
to
forget
her
birth
and
years
and
haply
her
wealth
there
would
be
little
merit
in
being
content
with
a
world
fashioned
after
our
own
caprices
though
it
may
be
questioned
if
we
should
be
happier
by
having
all
things
as
we
desire
than
by
being
compelled
to
submit
to
them
as
they
are
the
interest
taken
by
the
republic
in
thy
particular
welfare
daughter
is
the
price
thou
payest
for
the
ease
and
magnificence
with
which
thou
art
encircled
one
more
obscure
and
less
endowed
by
fortune
might
have
greater
freedom
of
will
but
it
would
be
accompanied
by
none
of
the
pomp
which
adorns
the
dwelling
of
thy
fathers
i
would
there
were
less
of
luxury
and
more
of
liberty
within
its
walls
time
will
enable
thee
to
see
differently
at
thy
age
all
is
viewed
in
colors
of
gold
or
life
is
rendered
bootless
because
we
are
thwarted
in
our
wishes
i
deny
not
however
that
thy
fortune
is
tempered
by
some
peculiar
passages
venice
is
ruled
by
a
policy
that
is
often
calculating
and
haply
some
deem
it
remorseless
though
the
voice
of
the
carmelite
had
fallen
he
paused
and
glanced
an
uneasy
look
from
beneath
his
cowl
ere
he
continued
the
caution
of
the
senate
teaches
it
to
preclude
as
far
as
in
it
lies
the
union
of
interests
that
may
not
only
oppose
each
other
but
which
may
endanger
those
of
the
state
thus
as
i
have
said
none
of
senatorial
rank
may
hold
lands
without
the
limits
of
the
republic
nor
may
any
of
account
connect
themselves
by
the
ties
of
marriage
with
strangers
of
dangerous
influence
without
the
consent
and
supervision
of
the
republic
the
latter
is
thy
situation
for
of
the
several
foreign
lords
who
seek
thy
hand
the
council
see
none
to
whom
the
favor
may
be
extended
without
the
apprehension
of
creating
an
influence
here
in
the
centre
of
the
canals
which
ought
not
to
be
given
to
a
stranger
don
camillo
monforte
the
cavalier
to
whom
thou
art
indebted
for
thy
life
and
of
whom
thou
hast
so
lately
spoken
with
gratitude
has
far
more
cause
to
complain
of
these
hard
decrees
than
thou
mayest
have
in
any
reason
make
my
griefs
still
heavier
did
i
know
that
one
who
has
shown
so
much
courage
in
my
behalf
has
equal
reason
to
feel
their
justice
returned
violetta
quickly
what
is
the
affair
that
so
fortunately
for
me
hath
brought
the
lord
of
sant
agata
to
venice
if
a
grateful
girl
may
without
indiscretion
inquire
thy
interest
in
his
behalf
is
both
natural
and
commendable
answered
the
carmelite
with
a
simplicity
which
did
more
credit
to
his
cowl
than
to
his
observation
he
is
young
and
doubtless
he
is
tempted
by
the
gifts
of
fortune
and
the
passions
of
his
years
to
divers
acts
of
weakness
remember
him
daughter
in
thy
prayers
that
part
of
the
debt
of
gratitude
may
be
repaid
his
worldly
interest
here
is
one
of
general
notoriety
and
i
can
ascribe
thy
ignorance
of
it
only
to
a
retired
manner
of
life
my
charge
hath
other
matters
to
occupy
her
thoughts
than
the
concerns
of
a
young
stranger
who
cometh
to
venice
for
affairs
mildly
observed
donna
florinda
but
if
i
am
to
remember
him
in
my
prayers
father
it
might
enlighten
my
petition
to
know
in
what
the
young
noble
is
most
wanting
i
would
have
thee
remember
his
spiritual
necessities
only
he
wanteth
of
a
truth
little
in
temporalities
that
the
world
can
offer
though
the
desires
of
life
often
lead
him
who
hath
most
in
quest
of
more
it
would
seem
that
an
ancestor
of
don
camillo
was
anciently
a
senator
of
venice
when
the
death
of
a
relation
brought
many
calabrian
signories
into
his
possession
the
younger
of
his
sons
by
an
especial
decree
which
favored
a
family
that
had
well
served
the
state
took
these
estates
while
the
elder
transmitted
the
senatorial
rank
and
the
venetian
fortunes
to
his
posterity
time
hath
extinguished
the
elder
branch
and
don
camillo
hath
for
years
besieged
the
council
to
be
restored
to
those
rights
which
his
predecessor
renounced
can
they
refuse
him
his
demand
involves
a
departure
from
established
laws
were
he
to
renounce
the
calabrian
lordships
the
neapolitan
might
lose
more
than
he
would
gain
and
to
keep
both
is
to
infringe
a
law
that
is
rarely
suffered
to
be
dormant
i
know
little
daughter
of
the
interests
of
life
but
there
are
enemies
of
the
republic
who
say
that
its
servitude
is
not
easy
and
that
it
seldom
bestows
favors
of
this
sort
without
seeking
an
ample
equivalent
is
this
as
it
should
be
if
don
camillo
monforte
has
claims
in
venice
whether
it
be
to
palaces
on
the
canals
or
to
lands
on
the
main
to
honors
in
the
state
or
voice
in
the
senate
justice
should
be
rendered
without
delay
lest
it
be
said
the
republic
vaunts
more
of
the
sacred
quality
than
it
practises
thou
speakest
as
a
guileless
nature
prompts
it
is
the
frailty
of
man
my
daughter
to
separate
his
public
acts
from
the
fearful
responsibility
of
his
private
deeds
as
if
god
in
endowing
his
being
with
reason
and
the
glorious
hopes
of
christianity
had
also
endowed
him
with
two
souls
of
which
only
one
was
to
be
cared
for
are
there
not
those
father
who
believe
that
while
the
evil
we
commit
as
individuals
is
visited
on
our
own
persons
that
which
is
done
by
states
falls
on
the
nation
the
pride
of
human
reason
has
invented
diverse
subtleties
to
satisfy
its
own
longings
but
it
can
never
feed
itself
on
a
delusion
more
fatal
than
this
the
crime
which
involves
others
in
its
guilt
or
consequences
is
doubly
a
crime
and
though
it
be
a
property
of
sin
to
entail
its
own
punishment
even
in
our
present
life
he
trusts
to
a
vain
hope
who
thinks
the
magnitude
of
the
offence
will
ever
be
its
apology
the
chief
security
of
our
nature
is
to
remove
it
beyond
temptation
and
he
is
safest
from
the
allurements
of
the
world
who
is
farthest
removed
from
its
vices
though
i
would
wish
justice
done
to
the
noble
neapolitan
it
may
be
for
his
everlasting
peace
that
the
additional
wealth
he
seeks
should
be
withheld
i
am
unwilling
to
believe
father
that
a
cavalier
who
has
shown
himself
so
ready
to
assist
the
distressed
will
easily
abuse
the
gifts
of
fortune
the
carmelite
fastened
an
uneasy
look
on
the
bright
features
of
the
young
venetian
parental
solicitude
and
prophetic
foresight
were
in
his
glance
but
the
expression
was
relieved
by
the
charity
of
a
chastened
spirit
gratitude
to
the
preserver
of
thy
life
becomes
thy
station
and
sex
it
is
a
duty
cherish
the
feeling
for
it
is
akin
to
the
holy
obligation
of
man
to
his
creator
is
it
enough
to
feel
grateful
demanded
violetta
one
of
my
name
and
alliances
might
do
more
we
can
move
the
patricians
of
my
family
in
behalf
of
the
stranger
that
his
protracted
suit
may
come
to
a
more
speedy
end
daughter
beware
the
intercession
of
one
in
whom
mark
feels
so
lively
an
interest
may
raise
up
enemies
to
don
camillo
instead
of
friends
donna
violetta
was
silent
while
the
monk
and
donna
florinda
both
regarded
her
with
affectionate
concern
the
former
then
adjusted
his
cowl
and
prepared
to
depart
the
noble
maiden
approached
the
carmelite
and
looking
into
his
face
with
ingenuous
confidence
and
habitual
reverence
she
besought
his
blessing
when
the
solemn
and
customary
office
was
performed
the
monk
turned
towards
the
companion
of
his
spiritual
charge
donna
florinda
permitted
the
silk
on
which
her
needle
had
been
busy
to
fall
into
her
lap
and
she
sat
in
meek
silence
while
the
carmelite
raised
his
open
palms
towards
her
bended
head
his
lips
moved
but
the
words
of
benediction
were
inaudible
had
the
ardent
being
intrusted
to
their
joint
care
been
less
occupied
with
her
own
feelings
or
more
practised
in
the
interests
of
that
world
into
which
she
was
about
to
enter
it
is
probable
she
would
have
detected
some
evidence
of
that
deep
but
smothered
sympathy
which
so
often
betrayed
itself
in
the
silent
intelligence
of
her
ghostly
father
and
her
female
mentor
thou
wilt
not
forget
us
father
said
violetta
with
winning
earnestness
an
orphan
girl
in
whose
fate
the
sages
of
the
republic
so
seriously
busy
themselves
has
need
of
every
friend
in
whom
she
can
confide
blessed
be
thy
intercessor
said
the
monk
and
the
peace
of
the
innocent
be
with
thee
once
more
he
waved
his
hand
and
turning
he
slowly
quitted
the
room
the
eye
of
donna
florinda
followed
the
white
robes
of
the
carmelite
while
they
were
visible
and
when
it
fell
again
upon
the
silk
it
was
for
a
moment
closed
as
if
looking
at
the
movements
of
the
rebuked
spirit
within
the
young
mistress
of
the
palace
summoned
a
menial
and
bade
him
do
honor
to
her
confessor
by
seeing
him
to
his
gondola
she
then
moved
to
the
open
balcony
a
long
pause
succeeded
it
was
such
a
silence
breathing
thoughtful
and
luxurious
with
the
repose
of
italy
as
suited
the
city
and
the
hour
suddenly
violetta
receded
from
the
open
window
and
withdrew
a
step
in
alarm
is
there
a
boat
beneath
demanded
her
companion
whose
glance
was
unavoidably
attracted
to
the
movement
the
water
was
never
more
quiet
but
thou
hearest
those
strains
of
the
hautboys
are
they
so
rare
on
the
canals
that
they
drive
thee
from
the
balcony
there
are
cavaliers
beneath
the
windows
of
the
mentoni
palace
doubtless
they
compliment
our
friend
olivia
even
that
gallantry
is
common
thou
knowest
that
olivia
is
shortly
to
be
united
to
her
kinsman
and
he
takes
the
usual
means
to
show
his
admiration
dost
thou
not
find
this
public
announcement
of
a
passion
painful
were
i
to
be
wooed
i
could
wish
it
might
only
be
to
my
own
ear
that
is
an
unhappy
sentiment
for
one
whose
hand
is
in
the
gift
of
the
senate
i
fear
that
a
maiden
of
thy
rank
must
be
content
to
hear
her
beauty
extolled
and
her
merits
sung
if
not
exaggerated
even
by
hirelings
beneath
a
balcony
i
would
that
they
were
done
exclaimed
violetta
stopping
her
ears
none
know
the
excellence
of
our
friend
better
than
i
but
this
open
exposure
of
thoughts
that
ought
to
be
so
private
must
wound
her
thou
mayest
go
again
into
the
balcony
the
music
ceases
there
are
gondoliers
singing
near
the
rialto
these
are
sounds
i
love
sweet
in
themselves
they
do
no
violence
to
our
sacred
feelings
art
thou
for
the
water
my
florinda
whither
thou
i
know
not
but
the
evening
is
brilliant
and
i
pine
to
mingle
with
the
splendor
and
pleasure
without
while
thousands
on
the
canals
pine
to
mingle
with
the
splendor
and
pleasure
within
thus
is
it
ever
with
life
that
which
is
possessed
is
little
valued
and
that
which
we
have
not
is
without
price
i
owe
my
duty
to
my
guardian
said
violetta
we
will
row
to
his
palace
though
donna
florinda
had
uttered
so
grave
a
moral
she
spoke
without
severity
casting
aside
her
work
she
prepared
to
gratify
the
desire
of
her
charge
it
was
the
usual
hour
for
the
high
in
rank
and
the
secluded
to
go
abroad
and
neither
venice
with
its
gay
throng
nor
italy
with
its
soft
climate
ever
offered
greater
temptation
to
seek
the
open
air
the
groom
of
the
chambers
was
called
the
gondoliers
were
summoned
and
the
ladies
cloaking
and
taking
their
masks
were
quickly
in
the
boat
chapter
if
your
master
would
have
a
queen
his
beggar
you
must
tell
him
that
majesty
to
keep
decorum
must
no
less
beg
than
a
kingdom
antony
and
cleopatra
the
silent
movement
of
the
gondola
soon
brought
the
fair
venetian
and
her
female
mentor
to
the
of
the
noble
who
had
been
intrusted
by
the
senate
with
the
especial
guardianship
of
the
person
of
the
heiress
it
was
a
residence
of
more
than
common
gloom
possessing
all
the
solemn
but
stately
magnificence
which
then
characterized
the
private
dwellings
of
the
patricians
in
that
city
of
riches
and
pride
its
magnitude
and
architecture
though
rather
less
imposing
than
those
which
distinguished
the
palace
of
the
donna
violetta
placed
it
among
the
private
edifices
of
the
first
order
and
all
its
external
decorations
showed
it
to
be
the
habitation
of
one
of
high
importance
within
the
noiseless
steps
and
the
air
of
silent
distrust
among
the
domestics
added
to
the
gloomy
grandeur
of
the
apartments
rendered
the
abode
no
bad
type
of
the
republic
itself
as
neither
of
his
present
visitors
was
a
stranger
beneath
the
roof
of
the
signor
gradenigo
for
so
the
proprietor
of
the
palace
was
called
they
ascended
its
massive
stairs
without
pausing
to
consider
any
of
those
novelties
of
construction
that
would
attract
the
eye
of
one
unaccustomed
to
such
a
dwelling
the
rank
and
the
known
consequence
of
the
donna
violetta
assured
her
of
a
ready
reception
and
while
she
was
ushered
to
the
suite
of
rooms
above
by
a
crowd
of
bowing
menials
one
had
gone
with
becoming
speed
to
announce
her
approach
to
his
master
when
in
the
however
the
ward
stopped
declining
to
proceed
any
further
in
deference
to
the
convenience
and
privacy
of
her
guardian
the
delay
was
short
for
no
sooner
was
the
old
senator
apprised
of
her
presence
than
he
hastened
from
his
closet
to
do
her
honor
with
a
zeal
that
did
credit
to
his
fitness
for
the
trust
he
filled
the
countenance
of
the
old
patrician
a
face
in
which
thought
and
care
had
drawn
as
many
lines
as
time
lighted
with
unequivocal
satisfaction
as
he
pressed
forward
to
receive
his
beautiful
ward
to
her
apologies
for
the
intrusion
he
would
not
listen
but
as
he
led
her
within
he
gallantly
professed
his
pleasure
at
being
honored
with
her
visits
even
at
moments
that
to
her
scrupulous
delicacy
might
appear
the
most
thou
canst
never
come
amiss
child
as
thou
art
of
my
ancient
friend
and
the
especial
care
of
the
state
he
added
the
gates
of
the
gradenigo
palace
would
open
of
themselves
at
the
latest
period
of
the
night
to
receive
such
a
guest
besides
the
hour
is
most
suited
to
the
convenience
of
one
of
thy
quality
who
would
breathe
the
fresh
evening
air
on
the
canals
were
i
to
limit
thee
to
hours
and
minutes
some
truant
wish
of
the
moment
some
innocent
caprice
of
thy
sex
and
years
might
go
ungratified
ah
donna
florinda
we
may
well
pray
that
all
our
affection
not
to
call
it
weakness
for
this
persuasive
girl
shall
not
in
the
end
lead
to
her
own
disadvantage
for
the
indulgence
of
both
i
am
grateful
returned
violetta
i
only
fear
to
urge
my
little
requests
at
moments
when
your
precious
time
is
more
worthily
occupied
in
behalf
of
the
state
thou
overratest
my
consequence
i
sometimes
visit
the
council
of
three
hundred
but
my
years
and
infirmities
preclude
me
now
from
serving
the
republic
as
i
could
wish
praise
be
to
mark
our
patron
its
affairs
are
not
unprosperous
for
our
declining
fortunes
we
have
dealt
bravely
with
the
infidel
of
late
the
treaty
with
the
emperor
is
not
to
our
wrong
and
the
anger
of
the
church
for
the
late
seeming
breach
of
confidence
on
our
part
has
been
diverted
we
owe
something
in
the
latter
affair
to
a
young
neapolitan
who
sojourns
here
at
venice
and
who
is
not
without
interest
at
the
holy
see
by
reason
of
his
uncle
the
cardinal
secretary
much
good
is
done
by
the
influence
of
friends
properly
employed
is
the
secret
of
our
success
in
the
actual
condition
of
venice
for
that
which
power
can
not
achieve
must
be
trusted
to
favor
and
a
wise
moderation
your
declarations
encourage
me
to
become
once
more
a
suitor
for
i
will
confess
that
in
addition
to
the
desire
of
doing
you
honor
i
have
come
equally
with
the
wish
to
urge
your
great
influence
in
behalf
of
an
earnest
suit
i
have
what
now
our
young
charge
donna
florinda
has
inherited
with
the
fortunes
of
her
family
its
ancient
habits
of
patronage
and
protection
but
we
will
not
discourage
the
feeling
for
it
has
a
worthy
origin
and
used
with
discretion
it
fortifies
the
noble
and
powerful
in
their
stations
and
may
we
not
say
mildly
observed
donna
florinda
that
when
the
affluent
and
happy
employ
themselves
with
the
cares
of
the
less
fortunate
they
not
only
discharge
a
duty
but
they
cultivate
a
wholesome
and
useful
state
of
mind
doubt
it
not
nothing
can
be
more
useful
than
to
give
to
each
class
in
society
a
proper
sense
of
its
obligations
and
a
just
sentiment
of
its
duties
these
are
opinions
i
greatly
approve
and
which
i
desire
my
ward
may
thoroughly
understand
she
is
happy
in
possessing
instructors
so
able
and
so
willing
to
teach
all
she
should
know
rejoined
violetta
with
this
admission
may
i
ask
the
signor
gradenigo
to
give
ear
to
my
petition
thy
little
requests
are
ever
welcome
i
would
merely
observe
that
generous
and
ardent
temperaments
sometimes
regard
a
distant
object
so
steadily
as
to
overlook
others
that
are
not
only
nearer
and
perhaps
of
still
more
urgent
importance
but
more
attainable
in
doing
a
benefit
to
one
we
should
be
wary
not
to
do
injury
to
many
the
relative
of
some
one
of
thy
household
may
have
thoughtlessly
enlisted
for
the
wars
should
it
be
so
i
trust
the
recruit
will
have
the
manhood
not
to
quit
his
colors
thy
nurse
who
is
one
little
likely
to
forget
the
service
she
did
thy
infancy
urges
the
claim
of
some
kinsman
to
an
employment
in
the
customs
i
believe
all
of
that
family
are
long
since
placed
said
violetta
laughing
unless
we
might
establish
the
good
mother
herself
in
some
station
of
honor
i
have
naught
to
ask
in
their
behalf
she
who
hath
reared
thee
to
this
goodly
and
healthful
beauty
would
prefer
a
suit
but
still
is
she
better
as
she
is
indolent
and
i
fear
pampered
by
thy
liberality
thy
private
purse
is
drained
by
demands
on
thy
charity
or
perhaps
the
waywardness
of
a
female
taste
hath
cost
thee
dear
of
late
neither
i
have
little
need
of
gold
for
one
of
my
years
can
not
properly
maintain
the
magnificence
of
her
condition
i
come
guardian
with
a
far
graver
solicitation
than
any
of
these
i
hope
none
in
thy
favor
have
been
indiscreet
of
speech
exclaimed
the
signor
gradenigo
casting
a
hasty
and
suspicious
look
at
his
ward
if
any
have
been
so
thoughtless
let
them
abide
the
punishment
of
their
fault
i
commend
thy
justice
in
this
age
of
novel
opinions
innovations
of
all
descriptions
can
not
be
too
severely
checked
were
the
senate
to
shut
its
ears
to
all
the
wild
theories
that
are
uttered
by
the
unthinking
and
vain
their
language
would
soon
penetrate
to
the
minds
of
the
ignorant
and
idle
ask
me
if
thou
wilt
for
purses
in
scores
but
do
not
move
me
to
forgetfulness
of
the
guilt
of
the
disturber
of
the
public
peace
not
a
sequin
my
errand
is
of
nobler
quality
speak
without
riddle
that
i
may
know
its
object
now
that
nothing
stood
between
her
wish
to
speak
and
her
own
manner
of
making
known
the
request
donna
violetta
appeared
to
shrink
from
expressing
it
her
color
went
and
came
and
she
sought
support
from
the
eye
of
her
attentive
and
wondering
companion
as
the
latter
was
ignorant
of
her
intention
however
she
could
do
no
more
than
encourage
the
supplicant
by
such
an
expression
of
sympathy
as
woman
rarely
refuses
to
her
sex
in
any
trial
that
involves
their
peculiar
and
distinctive
feelings
violetta
struggled
with
her
diffidence
and
then
laughing
at
her
own
want
of
she
continued
you
know
signor
gradenigo
she
said
with
a
loftiness
that
was
not
less
puzzling
though
far
more
intelligible
than
the
agitation
which
a
moment
before
had
embarrassed
her
manner
that
i
am
the
last
of
a
line
eminent
for
centuries
in
the
state
of
venice
so
sayeth
our
history
that
i
bear
a
name
long
known
and
which
it
becomes
me
to
shield
from
all
imputation
of
discredit
in
my
own
person
this
is
so
true
that
it
scarce
needed
so
clear
an
exposure
drily
returned
the
senator
and
that
though
thus
gifted
by
the
accidents
of
fortune
and
birth
i
have
received
a
boon
that
remains
still
unrequited
in
a
manner
to
do
no
honor
to
the
house
of
thiepolo
this
becometh
serious
donna
florinda
our
ward
is
more
earnest
than
intelligible
and
i
must
ask
an
explanation
at
your
hands
it
becometh
her
not
to
receive
boons
of
this
nature
from
any
though
unprepared
for
this
request
mildly
replied
the
companion
i
think
she
speaks
of
the
boon
of
life
the
signor
gradenigo
countenance
assumed
a
dark
expression
i
understand
you
he
said
coldly
it
is
true
that
the
neapolitan
was
ready
to
rescue
thee
when
the
calamity
befell
thy
uncle
of
florence
but
don
camillo
monforte
is
not
a
common
diver
of
the
lido
to
be
rewarded
like
him
who
finds
a
bauble
dropped
from
a
gondola
thou
hast
thanked
the
cavalier
i
trust
that
a
noble
maiden
can
do
no
more
in
a
case
like
this
that
i
have
thanked
him
and
thanked
him
from
my
soul
is
true
fervently
exclaimed
violetta
when
i
forget
the
service
maria
santissima
and
the
good
saints
forget
me
i
doubt
signora
florinda
that
your
charge
hath
spent
more
hours
among
the
light
works
of
her
late
father
library
and
less
time
with
her
missal
than
becomes
her
birth
the
eye
of
violetta
kindled
and
she
folded
an
arm
around
the
form
of
her
shrinking
companion
who
drew
down
her
veil
at
this
reproof
though
she
forbore
to
answer
signor
gradenigo
said
the
young
heiress
i
may
have
done
discredit
to
my
instructors
but
if
the
pupil
has
been
idle
the
fault
should
not
be
visited
on
the
innocent
it
is
some
evidence
that
the
commands
of
holy
church
have
not
been
neglected
that
i
now
come
to
entreat
favor
in
behalf
of
one
to
whom
i
owe
my
life
don
camillo
monforte
has
long
pursued
without
success
a
claim
so
just
that
were
there
no
other
motive
to
concede
it
the
character
of
venice
should
teach
the
senators
the
danger
of
delay
my
ward
has
spent
lier
leisure
with
the
doctors
of
padua
the
republic
hath
its
laws
and
none
who
have
right
on
their
side
appeal
to
them
in
vain
thy
gratitude
is
not
to
be
censured
it
is
rather
worthy
of
thy
origin
and
hopes
still
donna
violetta
we
should
remember
how
difficult
it
is
to
winnow
the
truth
from
the
chaff
of
imposition
and
legal
subtlety
and
most
of
all
should
a
judge
be
certain
before
he
gives
his
decree
that
in
confirming
the
claims
of
one
applicant
he
does
not
defeat
those
of
another
they
tamper
with
his
rights
being
born
in
a
foreign
realm
he
is
required
to
renounce
more
in
the
land
of
the
stranger
than
he
will
gain
within
the
limits
of
the
republic
he
wastes
life
and
youth
in
pursuing
a
phantom
you
are
of
weight
in
the
senate
my
guardian
and
were
you
to
lend
him
the
support
of
your
powerful
voice
and
great
instruction
a
wronged
noble
would
have
justice
and
venice
though
she
might
lose
a
trifle
from
her
stores
would
better
deserve
the
character
of
which
she
is
so
jealous
thou
art
a
persuasive
advocate
and
i
will
think
of
what
thou
urgest
said
the
signor
gradenigo
changing
the
frown
which
had
been
gathering
about
his
brow
to
a
look
of
indulgence
with
a
facility
that
betrayed
much
practice
in
adapting
the
expression
of
his
features
to
his
policy
i
ought
only
to
hearken
to
the
neapolitan
in
my
public
character
of
a
judge
but
his
service
to
thee
and
my
weakness
in
thy
behalf
extorts
that
thou
have
donna
violetta
received
the
promise
with
a
bright
and
guileless
smile
she
kissed
the
hand
he
extended
as
the
pledge
of
his
faith
with
a
fervor
that
gave
her
attentive
guardian
serious
uneasiness
thou
art
too
winning
even
to
be
resisted
by
one
wearied
with
rebutting
plausible
pretensions
he
added
the
young
and
the
generous
donna
florinda
believe
all
to
be
as
their
own
wishes
and
simplicity
would
have
them
as
for
this
right
of
don
camillo
but
no
matter
thou
wilt
have
it
so
and
it
shall
be
examined
with
that
blindness
which
is
said
to
be
the
failing
of
justice
i
have
understood
the
metaphor
to
mean
blind
to
favor
but
not
insensible
to
the
right
i
fear
that
is
a
sense
which
might
defeat
our
hopes
but
we
will
look
into
it
my
son
has
been
mindful
of
his
duty
and
respect
of
late
donna
violetta
as
i
would
have
him
the
boy
wants
little
urging
i
know
to
do
honor
to
my
ward
and
the
fairest
of
venice
thou
wilt
receive
him
with
friendship
for
the
love
thou
bearest
his
father
donna
violetta
curtsied
but
it
was
with
womanly
reserve
the
door
of
my
palace
is
never
shut
on
the
signor
giacomo
on
all
proper
occasions
she
said
coldly
signore
the
son
of
my
guardian
could
hardly
be
other
than
an
honored
visitor
i
would
have
the
boy
attentive
and
even
more
i
would
have
him
prove
some
little
of
that
great
esteem
but
we
live
in
a
jealous
city
donna
florinda
and
one
in
which
prudence
is
a
virtue
of
the
highest
price
if
the
youth
is
less
urgent
than
i
could
wish
believe
me
it
is
from
the
apprehension
of
giving
premature
alarm
to
those
who
interest
themselves
in
the
fortunes
of
our
charge
both
the
ladies
bowed
and
by
the
manner
in
which
they
drew
their
cloaks
about
them
they
made
evident
their
wish
to
retire
donna
violetta
craved
a
blessing
and
after
the
usual
compliments
and
a
short
dialogue
of
courtesy
she
and
her
companion
withdrew
to
their
boat
the
signor
gradenigo
paced
the
room
in
which
he
had
received
his
ward
for
several
minutes
in
silence
not
a
sound
of
any
sort
was
audible
throughout
the
whole
of
that
vast
abode
the
stillness
and
cautious
tread
of
those
within
answering
to
the
quiet
town
without
but
a
young
man
in
whose
countenance
and
air
were
to
be
seen
most
of
the
usual
signs
of
a
profligacy
sauntering
along
the
suite
of
chambers
at
length
caught
the
eye
of
the
senator
who
beckoned
him
to
approach
thou
art
unhappy
as
of
wont
giacomo
he
said
in
a
tone
between
paternal
indulgence
and
reproach
the
donna
violetta
has
but
a
minute
since
departed
and
thou
wert
absent
some
unworthy
intrigue
with
the
daughter
of
a
jeweller
or
some
injurious
bargain
of
thy
hopes
with
the
father
hath
occupied
the
time
that
might
have
been
devoted
more
honorably
and
to
far
better
profit
you
do
me
little
justice
returned
the
youth
neither
jew
nor
jewess
hath
this
day
greeted
my
eye
the
calendar
should
mark
the
time
for
its
singularity
i
would
know
giacomo
if
thou
turnest
to
a
right
advantage
the
occasion
of
my
guardianship
and
if
thou
thinkest
with
sufficient
gravity
of
the
importance
of
what
i
urge
doubt
it
not
father
he
who
hath
so
much
suffered
for
the
want
of
that
which
the
donna
violetta
possesses
in
so
great
a
profusion
needeth
little
prompting
on
such
a
subject
by
refusing
to
supply
my
wants
you
have
made
certain
of
my
consent
there
is
not
a
fool
in
venice
who
sighs
more
loudly
beneath
his
mistress
window
than
i
utter
my
pathetic
wishes
to
the
lady
when
there
is
opportunity
and
i
am
in
the
humor
thou
knowest
the
danger
of
alarming
the
senate
fear
me
not
my
progress
is
by
secret
and
gradual
means
neither
my
countenance
nor
my
mind
is
unused
to
a
mask
thanks
to
necessity
my
spirits
have
been
too
buoyant
not
to
have
made
me
acquainted
with
duplicity
thou
speakest
ungrateful
boy
as
if
i
denied
thy
youth
the
usual
indulgences
of
thy
years
and
rank
it
is
thy
excesses
and
not
thy
spirits
i
would
check
but
i
would
not
now
harden
thee
with
reproof
giacomo
thou
hast
a
rival
in
the
stranger
his
act
in
the
giudecca
has
won
upon
the
fancy
of
the
girl
and
like
all
of
generous
and
ardent
natures
ignorant
as
she
is
of
his
merits
she
supplies
his
character
with
all
necessary
qualities
by
her
own
ingenuity
i
would
she
did
the
same
by
me
with
thee
sirrah
my
ward
might
be
required
to
forget
rather
than
invent
hast
thou
bethought
thee
of
turning
the
eyes
of
the
council
on
the
danger
which
besets
their
heiress
i
have
and
the
means
the
plainest
and
the
most
certain
the
lion
mouth
ha
that
indeed
is
a
bold
adventure
and
like
all
bold
adventures
it
is
the
more
likely
to
succeed
for
once
fortune
hath
not
been
a
niggard
with
me
i
have
given
them
the
neapolitan
signet
by
way
of
proof
giacomo
dost
thou
know
the
hazard
of
thy
temerity
i
hope
there
is
no
clue
left
in
the
handwriting
or
by
any
other
means
taken
to
obtain
the
ring
father
though
i
may
have
overlooked
thy
instruction
in
less
weighty
matters
not
an
admonition
which
touches
the
policy
of
venice
hath
been
forgotten
the
neapolitan
stands
accused
and
if
thy
council
is
faithful
he
will
be
a
suspected
if
not
a
banished
man
that
the
council
of
three
will
perform
its
trust
is
beyond
dispute
i
would
i
were
as
certain
that
thy
indiscreet
zeal
may
not
lead
to
some
unpleasant
exposure
the
shameless
son
stared
at
the
father
a
moment
in
doubt
and
then
he
passed
into
the
more
private
parts
of
the
palace
like
one
too
much
accustomed
to
to
lend
it
a
second
or
a
serious
thought
the
senator
remained
his
silent
walk
was
now
manifestly
disturbed
by
great
uneasiness
and
he
frequently
passed
a
hand
across
his
brow
as
if
he
mused
in
pain
while
thus
occupied
a
figure
stole
through
the
long
suite
of
and
stopped
near
the
door
of
the
room
he
occupied
the
intruder
was
aged
his
face
was
tawny
by
exposure
and
his
hair
thinned
and
whitened
by
time
his
dress
was
that
of
a
fisherman
being
both
scanty
and
of
the
meanest
materials
still
there
was
a
naturally
noble
and
frank
intelligence
in
his
bold
eye
and
prominent
features
while
the
bare
arms
and
naked
legs
exhibited
a
muscle
and
proportion
which
proved
that
nature
was
rather
at
a
stand
than
in
the
decline
he
had
been
many
moments
dangling
his
cap
in
habitual
but
unembarrassed
respect
before
his
presence
was
observed
ha
thou
here
antonio
exclaimed
the
senator
when
their
eyes
met
why
this
visit
signore
my
heart
is
heavy
hath
the
calendar
no
saint
the
fisherman
no
patron
i
suppose
the
sirocco
hath
been
tossing
the
waters
of
the
bay
and
thy
nets
are
empty
hold
thou
art
my
and
thou
must
not
want
the
fisherman
drew
back
with
dignity
refusing
the
gift
simply
but
decidedly
by
the
act
signore
we
have
lived
from
childhood
to
old
age
since
we
drew
our
milk
from
the
same
breast
in
all
that
time
have
you
ever
known
me
a
beggar
thou
art
not
wont
to
ask
these
boons
antonio
it
is
true
but
age
conquers
our
pride
with
our
strength
if
it
be
not
sequins
that
thou
seekest
what
thou
there
are
other
wants
than
those
of
the
body
signore
and
other
sufferings
besides
hunger
the
countenance
of
the
senator
lowered
he
cast
a
sharp
glance
at
his
and
ere
he
answered
he
closed
the
door
which
communicated
with
the
outer
chamber
thy
words
forebode
disaffection
as
of
wont
thou
art
accustomed
to
comment
on
measures
and
interests
that
are
beyond
thy
limited
reason
and
thou
knowest
that
thy
opinions
have
already
drawn
displeasure
on
thee
the
ignorant
and
the
low
are
to
the
state
as
children
whose
duty
it
is
to
obey
and
not
to
cavil
thy
errand
i
am
not
the
man
you
think
me
signore
i
am
used
to
poverty
and
want
and
little
satisfies
my
wishes
the
senate
is
my
master
and
as
such
i
honor
it
but
a
fisherman
hath
his
feelings
as
well
as
the
doge
again
these
feelings
of
thine
antonio
are
most
exacting
thou
namest
them
on
all
occasions
as
if
they
were
the
engrossing
concerns
of
life
signore
are
they
not
to
me
though
i
think
mostly
of
my
own
concerns
still
i
can
have
a
thought
for
the
distress
of
those
i
honor
when
the
beautiful
and
youthful
lady
your
eccellenza
daughter
was
called
away
to
the
company
of
the
saints
i
felt
the
blow
as
if
it
had
been
the
death
of
my
own
child
and
it
has
pleased
god
as
you
very
well
know
signore
not
to
leave
me
unacquainted
with
the
anguish
of
such
a
loss
thou
art
a
good
fellow
antonio
returned
the
senator
covertly
removing
the
moisture
from
his
eyes
an
honest
and
a
proud
man
for
thy
condition
she
from
whom
we
both
drew
our
first
nourishment
signore
often
told
me
that
next
to
my
own
kin
it
was
my
duty
to
love
the
noble
race
she
had
helped
to
support
i
make
no
merit
of
natural
feeling
which
is
a
gift
from
heaven
and
the
greater
is
the
reason
that
the
state
should
not
deal
lightly
with
such
affections
once
more
the
state
name
thy
errand
your
eccellenza
knows
the
history
of
my
humble
life
i
need
not
tell
you
signore
of
the
sons
which
god
by
the
intercession
of
the
virgin
and
blessed
anthony
was
pleased
to
bestow
on
me
or
of
the
manner
in
which
he
hath
seen
proper
to
take
them
one
by
one
away
thou
hast
known
sorrow
poor
antonio
i
well
remember
thou
hast
suffered
too
signore
i
have
the
deaths
of
five
manly
and
honest
sons
is
a
blow
to
bring
a
groan
from
a
rock
but
i
have
known
how
to
bless
god
and
be
thankful
worthy
fisherman
the
doge
himself
might
envy
this
resignation
it
is
often
easier
to
endure
the
loss
than
the
life
of
a
child
antonio
signore
no
boy
of
mine
ever
caused
me
grief
but
the
hour
in
which
he
died
and
even
then
the
old
man
turned
aside
to
conceal
the
working
of
his
features
i
struggled
to
remember
from
how
much
pain
and
toil
and
suffering
they
were
removed
to
enjoy
a
more
blessed
state
the
lip
of
the
signer
gradenigo
quivered
and
he
moved
to
and
fro
with
a
quicker
step
i
think
antonio
he
said
i
think
honest
antonio
i
had
masses
said
for
the
souls
of
them
all
signore
you
had
anthony
remember
the
kindness
in
your
own
extremity
i
was
wrong
in
saying
that
the
youths
never
gave
me
sorrow
but
in
dying
for
there
is
a
pain
the
rich
can
not
know
in
being
too
poor
to
buy
a
prayer
for
a
dead
child
wilt
thou
have
more
masses
son
of
thine
shall
never
want
a
voice
with
the
saints
for
the
ease
of
his
soul
i
thank
you
eccellenza
but
i
have
faith
in
what
has
been
done
and
more
than
all
in
the
mercy
of
god
my
errand
now
is
in
behalf
of
the
living
the
sympathy
of
the
senator
was
suddenly
checked
and
he
already
listened
with
a
doubting
and
suspicious
air
thy
errand
he
simply
repeated
is
to
beg
your
interest
signore
to
obtain
the
release
of
my
grandson
from
the
galleys
they
have
seized
the
lad
in
his
fourteenth
year
and
condemned
him
to
the
wars
with
the
infidels
without
thought
of
his
tender
years
without
thought
of
evil
example
without
thought
of
my
age
and
loneliness
and
without
justice
for
his
father
died
in
the
last
battle
given
to
the
turk
as
he
ceased
the
fisherman
riveted
his
look
on
the
marble
countenance
of
his
auditor
wistfully
endeavoring
to
trace
the
effect
of
his
words
but
all
there
was
cold
unanswering
and
void
of
human
sympathy
the
soulless
practised
and
specious
reasoning
of
the
state
had
long
since
deadened
all
feeling
in
the
senator
on
any
subject
that
touched
an
interest
so
vital
as
the
maritime
power
of
the
republic
he
saw
the
hazard
of
innovation
in
the
slightest
approach
to
interests
so
delicate
and
his
mind
was
drilled
by
policy
into
an
apathy
that
no
charity
could
disturb
when
there
was
question
of
the
right
of
mark
to
the
services
of
his
people
i
would
thou
hadst
come
to
beg
masses
or
gold
or
aught
but
this
antonio
he
answered
after
a
moment
of
delay
thou
hast
had
the
company
of
the
boy
if
i
remember
from
his
birth
already
signore
i
have
had
that
satisfaction
for
he
was
an
orphan
born
and
i
would
wish
to
have
it
until
the
child
is
fit
to
go
into
the
world
armed
with
an
honesty
and
faith
that
shall
keep
him
from
harm
were
my
own
brave
son
here
he
would
ask
no
other
fortune
for
the
lad
than
such
counsel
and
aid
as
a
poor
man
has
a
right
to
bestow
on
his
own
flesh
and
blood
he
fareth
no
worse
than
others
and
thou
knowest
that
the
republic
hath
need
of
every
arm
eccellenza
i
saw
the
signor
giacomo
land
from
his
gondola
as
i
entered
the
palace
out
upon
thee
fellow
dost
thou
make
no
distinction
between
the
son
of
a
fisherman
one
trained
to
the
oar
and
toil
and
the
heir
of
an
ancient
house
go
to
presuming
man
and
remember
thy
condition
and
the
difference
that
god
hath
made
between
our
children
mine
never
gave
me
sorrow
but
the
hour
in
which
they
died
said
the
fisherman
uttering
a
severe
but
mild
reproof
the
signor
gradenigo
felt
the
sting
of
this
retort
which
in
no
degree
aided
the
cause
of
his
indiscreet
after
pacing
the
room
in
agitation
for
some
time
he
so
far
conquered
his
resentment
as
to
answer
more
mildly
as
became
his
rank
antonio
he
said
thy
disposition
and
boldness
are
not
strangers
to
me
if
thou
have
masses
for
the
dead
or
gold
for
the
living
they
are
thine
but
in
asking
for
my
interest
with
the
general
of
the
galleys
thou
askest
that
which
at
a
moment
so
critical
could
not
be
yielded
to
the
son
of
the
doge
were
the
doge
a
fisherman
continued
antonio
observing
that
he
hesitated
signore
adieu
i
would
not
part
in
anger
with
my
and
i
pray
the
saints
to
bless
you
and
your
house
may
you
never
know
the
grief
of
losing
a
child
by
a
fate
far
worse
than
death
that
of
destruction
by
vice
as
antonio
ceased
he
made
his
reverence
and
departed
by
the
way
he
had
entered
he
retired
unnoticed
for
the
senator
averted
his
eyes
with
a
secret
consciousness
of
the
force
of
what
the
other
in
his
simplicity
had
uttered
and
it
was
some
time
before
the
latter
knew
he
was
alone
another
step
however
soon
diverted
his
attention
the
door
and
a
menial
appeared
he
announced
that
one
without
sought
a
private
audience
let
him
enter
answered
the
ready
senator
smoothing
his
features
to
the
customary
cautious
and
distrustful
expression
the
servant
withdrew
when
one
masked
and
wearing
a
cloak
quickly
entered
the
room
when
the
latter
instrument
of
disguise
was
thrown
upon
an
arm
and
the
visor
was
removed
the
form
and
face
of
the
dreaded
jacopo
became
visible
chapter
vi
caesar
himself
has
work
and
our
oppression
exceeds
what
we
expected
shakspeare
didst
thou
note
him
that
left
me
eagerly
demanded
the
signer
gradenigo
i
did
enough
so
to
recognise
form
and
countenance
was
a
fisherman
of
the
lagunes
named
antonio
the
senator
dropped
the
extended
limb
and
regarded
the
bravo
with
a
look
in
which
surprise
and
admiration
were
equally
blended
he
resumed
his
course
up
and
down
the
room
while
his
companion
stood
waiting
his
pleasure
in
an
attitude
so
calm
as
to
be
dignified
a
few
minutes
were
wasted
in
this
abstraction
thou
art
quick
of
sight
jacopo
continued
the
patrician
breaking
the
pause
hast
thou
had
dealings
with
the
man
never
thou
art
certain
it
is
your
eccellenza
i
did
not
inquire
into
thy
knowledge
of
his
infancy
and
origin
but
of
his
present
state
returned
the
signor
gradenigo
turning
away
to
conceal
his
countenance
from
the
glowing
eye
of
jacopo
has
he
been
named
to
thee
by
any
in
authority
he
has
not
my
mission
does
not
lie
with
fishermen
duty
may
lead
us
into
still
humbler
society
young
man
they
who
are
charged
with
the
grievous
burden
of
the
state
must
not
consider
the
quality
of
the
load
they
carry
in
what
manner
hath
this
antonio
come
to
thy
knowledge
i
have
known
him
as
one
esteemed
by
his
fellows
a
man
skilful
in
his
craft
and
long
practised
in
the
mystery
of
the
lagunes
he
is
a
defrauder
of
the
revenue
thou
be
understood
to
say
i
would
not
he
toils
too
late
and
early
to
have
other
means
of
support
than
labor
thou
knowest
jacopo
the
severity
of
our
laws
in
matters
that
concern
the
public
moneys
i
know
that
the
judgment
of
mark
signore
is
never
light
when
its
own
interest
is
touched
thou
art
not
required
to
utter
opinions
beyond
the
present
question
this
man
hath
a
habit
of
courting
the
goodwill
of
his
associates
and
of
making
his
voice
heard
concerning
affairs
of
which
none
but
his
superiors
may
discreetly
judge
signore
he
is
old
and
the
tongue
grows
loose
with
years
this
is
not
the
character
of
antonio
nature
hath
not
treated
him
unkindly
had
his
birth
and
education
been
equal
to
his
mind
the
senate
might
have
been
glad
to
listen
at
it
is
i
fear
he
speaks
in
a
sense
to
endanger
his
own
interests
surely
if
he
speaks
to
offend
the
ear
of
st
mark
there
was
a
quick
suspicious
glance
from
the
senator
to
the
bravo
as
if
to
read
the
true
meaning
of
the
latter
words
finding
however
the
same
expression
of
in
the
quiet
features
he
scrutinized
the
latter
continued
as
if
distrust
had
not
been
awakened
if
as
thou
sayest
he
so
speaks
as
to
injure
the
republic
his
years
have
not
brought
discretion
i
love
the
man
jacopo
for
it
is
usual
to
regard
with
some
partiality
those
who
have
drawn
nourishment
from
the
same
breast
with
ourselves
signore
it
is
and
feeling
this
weakness
in
his
favor
i
would
have
him
admonished
to
be
prudent
thou
art
acquainted
doubtless
with
his
opinions
concerning
the
recent
necessity
of
the
state
to
command
the
services
of
all
the
youths
on
the
lagunes
in
her
fleets
i
know
that
the
press
has
taken
from
him
the
boy
who
toiled
in
his
company
to
toil
honorably
and
perhaps
gainfully
in
behalf
of
the
republic
signore
perhaps
thou
art
brief
in
thy
speech
jacopo
but
if
thou
knowest
the
fisherman
give
him
counsel
of
discretion
mark
will
not
tolerate
such
free
opinions
of
his
wisdom
this
is
the
third
occasion
in
which
there
has
been
need
to
repress
that
fisherman
speech
for
the
paternal
care
of
the
senate
can
not
see
discontent
planted
in
the
bosom
of
a
class
it
is
their
duty
and
pleasure
to
render
happy
seek
opportunities
to
let
him
hear
this
wholesome
truth
for
in
good
sooth
i
would
not
willingly
see
a
misfortune
light
upon
the
head
of
a
son
of
my
ancient
nurse
and
that
too
in
the
decline
of
his
days
the
bravo
bent
his
body
in
acquiescence
while
the
signor
gradenigo
paced
the
room
in
a
manner
to
show
that
he
really
felt
concern
thou
hast
had
advice
of
the
judgment
in
the
matter
of
the
genoese
resumed
the
latter
when
another
pause
had
given
time
to
change
the
current
of
his
thoughts
the
sentence
of
the
tribunals
has
been
prompt
and
though
there
is
much
assumption
of
a
dislike
between
the
two
republics
the
world
can
now
see
how
sternly
justice
is
con
sulted
on
our
isles
i
hear
the
genoese
will
have
ample
amends
and
that
certain
of
our
own
citizens
will
be
mulcted
of
much
money
i
have
heard
the
same
since
the
sun
set
in
the
piazzetta
signore
and
do
men
converse
of
our
impartiality
and
more
than
all
of
our
promptitude
bethink
thee
jacopo
is
but
a
since
the
claim
was
preferred
to
the
senate
equity
none
dispute
the
promptitude
with
which
the
republic
visits
offences
nor
the
justice
i
trust
also
good
jacopo
there
is
a
beauty
and
a
harmony
in
the
manner
in
which
the
social
machine
rolls
on
its
course
under
such
a
system
that
should
secure
men
applause
justice
administers
to
the
wants
of
society
and
checks
the
passions
with
a
force
as
silent
and
dignified
as
if
her
decrees
came
from
a
higher
volition
i
often
compare
the
quiet
march
of
the
state
contrasted
with
the
troubled
movements
of
some
other
of
our
italian
sisters
to
the
difference
between
the
clatter
of
a
clamorous
town
and
the
stillness
of
our
own
noiseless
canals
then
the
uprightness
of
the
late
decree
is
in
the
mouths
of
the
masquers
signore
the
venetians
are
bold
when
there
is
an
opportunity
to
praise
their
masters
dost
thou
think
thus
jacopo
to
me
they
have
ever
seemed
more
prone
to
vent
their
seditious
discontent
but
is
the
nature
of
man
to
be
niggardly
of
praise
and
lavish
of
censure
this
decree
of
the
tribunal
must
not
be
suffered
to
die
with
the
mere
justice
of
the
case
our
friends
should
dwell
on
it
openly
in
the
cafés
and
at
the
lido
they
will
have
no
cause
to
fear
should
they
give
their
tongues
a
little
latitude
a
just
government
hath
no
jealousy
of
comment
true
signore
i
look
to
thee
and
thy
fellows
to
see
that
the
affair
be
not
too
quickly
forgotten
the
contemplation
of
acts
such
as
this
will
quicken
the
dormant
seeds
of
virtue
in
the
public
mind
he
who
has
examples
of
equity
incessantly
before
his
eyes
will
come
at
last
to
love
the
quality
the
genoese
i
trust
will
depart
satisfied
doubt
it
not
signore
he
has
all
that
can
content
a
sufferer
his
own
with
usury
and
revenge
of
him
who
did
the
wrong
such
is
the
decree
ample
restoration
and
the
chastening
hand
of
punishment
few
states
would
thus
render
a
judgment
against
themselves
jacopo
is
the
state
answerable
for
the
deed
of
the
merchant
signore
through
its
citizen
he
who
inflicts
punishment
on
his
own
members
is
a
sufferer
surely
no
one
can
part
with
his
own
flesh
without
pain
is
not
this
true
fellow
there
are
nerves
that
are
delicate
to
the
touch
signore
and
an
eye
or
a
tooth
is
precious
but
the
paring
of
a
nail
or
the
fall
of
the
beard
is
little
heeded
one
who
did
not
know
thee
jacopo
would
imagine
thee
in
the
interest
of
the
emperor
the
sparrow
does
not
fall
in
venice
without
the
loss
touching
the
parental
feelings
of
the
senate
well
is
there
further
rumor
among
the
jews
of
a
decrease
of
gold
sequins
are
not
so
abundant
as
of
wont
and
the
chicanery
of
that
race
lends
itself
to
the
scarcity
in
the
hope
of
larger
profits
i
have
seen
faces
on
the
rialto
of
late
signore
that
look
empty
purses
the
christian
seems
anxious
and
in
want
while
the
unbelievers
wear
their
gaberdines
with
a
looser
air
than
is
usual
this
hath
been
expected
doth
report
openly
name
any
of
the
israelites
who
are
in
the
custom
of
lending
on
usury
to
the
young
nobles
all
who
have
to
lend
may
be
accounted
of
the
class
the
whole
synagogue
rabbis
and
all
are
of
a
mind
when
there
is
question
of
a
christian
purse
thou
likest
not
the
hebrew
jacopo
but
he
is
of
good
service
in
the
republic
straits
we
count
all
friends
who
are
ready
with
their
gold
at
need
still
the
young
hopes
of
venice
must
not
be
left
to
waste
their
substance
in
unwary
bargains
with
the
gainful
race
and
thou
hear
of
any
of
mark
who
are
thought
to
be
too
deeply
in
their
clutches
thou
wilt
do
wisely
to
let
the
same
be
known
with
little
delay
to
the
guardians
of
the
public
weal
we
must
deal
tenderly
with
those
who
prop
the
state
but
we
must
also
deal
discreetly
with
those
who
will
shortly
compose
it
hast
thou
aught
to
say
in
the
matter
i
have
heard
men
speak
of
signor
giacomo
as
paying
dearest
for
their
favors
gesu
maria
my
son
and
heir
dost
thou
not
deceive
me
man
to
gratify
thine
own
displeasure
against
the
hebrews
i
have
no
other
malice
against
the
race
signore
than
the
wholesome
disrelish
of
a
christian
thus
much
i
hope
may
be
permitted
to
a
believer
but
beyond
that
in
reason
i
carry
hatred
to
no
man
it
is
well
known
that
your
heir
is
disposing
freely
of
his
hopes
and
at
prices
that
lower
expectations
might
command
this
is
a
weighty
concern
the
boy
must
be
speedily
admonished
of
the
consequences
and
care
must
be
had
for
his
future
discretion
the
hebrew
shall
be
punished
and
as
a
solemn
warning
to
the
whole
tribe
the
debt
confiscated
to
the
benefit
of
the
borrower
with
such
an
example
before
their
eyes
the
knaves
will
be
less
ready
with
their
sequins
holy
theodore
to
suffer
one
of
such
promise
to
be
lost
for
the
want
of
prudent
forethought
i
will
charge
myself
with
the
matter
as
an
especial
duty
and
the
senate
shall
have
no
cause
to
say
that
its
interests
have
been
neglected
hast
thou
had
applications
of
late
in
thy
character
of
avenger
of
private
wrongs
none
of
note
there
is
one
that
seeks
me
earnestly
though
i
am
not
yet
wholly
the
master
of
his
wishes
thy
office
is
of
much
delicacy
and
trust
and
as
thou
art
well
aware
the
reward
is
weighty
and
sure
the
eyes
of
the
bravo
kindled
with
an
expression
which
caused
his
companion
to
pause
but
observing
that
the
repose
for
which
the
features
of
jacopo
were
so
remarkable
again
presided
over
his
pallid
face
he
continued
as
if
there
had
been
no
interruption
i
repeat
the
bounty
and
clemency
of
the
state
will
not
be
forgotten
if
its
justice
is
stern
and
infallible
its
forgiveness
is
cordial
and
its
favors
ample
of
these
facts
i
have
taken
much
pains
to
assure
thee
jacopo
blessed
mark
that
one
of
the
scions
of
thy
great
stock
should
waste
his
substance
for
the
benefit
of
a
race
of
unbelievers
but
thou
hast
not
named
him
who
seeks
thee
with
this
earnestness
as
i
have
yet
to
learn
his
errand
before
i
go
further
signore
it
may
be
well
to
know
more
of
his
wishes
this
reserve
is
uncalled
for
thou
art
not
to
distrust
the
prudence
of
the
republic
ministers
and
i
should
be
sorry
were
the
inquisitors
to
get
an
unfavorable
opinion
of
thy
zeal
the
individual
must
be
denounced
i
denounce
him
not
the
most
that
i
can
say
is
that
he
hath
a
desire
to
deal
privately
with
one
with
whom
it
is
almost
criminal
to
deal
at
all
the
prevention
of
crime
is
better
than
its
punishment
and
such
is
the
true
object
of
all
government
thou
wilt
not
withhold
the
name
of
thy
correspondent
it
is
a
noble
neapolitan
who
hath
long
sojourned
in
venice
on
matters
touching
a
great
succession
and
some
right
even
to
the
dignity

don
camillo
monforte
am

the
same
the
pause
which
followed
was
only
broken
by
the
clock
of
the
great
square
striking
eleven
or
the
fourth
hour
of
the
night
as
it
is
termed
by
the
usage
of
italy
the
senator
started
consulted
a
in
his
own
apartment
and
again
addressed
his
companion
this
is
well
he
said
thy
faith
and
punctuality
shall
be
remembered
look
to
the
fisherman
antonio
the
murmurs
of
the
old
man
must
not
be
permitted
to
awaken
discontent
for
a
cause
so
trifling
as
this
transfer
of
his
descendant
from
a
gondola
to
a
galley
and
most
of
all
keep
thy
ears
attentive
to
any
rumors
on
the
rialto
the
glory
and
credit
of
a
patrician
name
must
not
be
weakened
by
the
errors
of
boyhood
as
to
this
stranger
quickly
thy
mask
and
cloak
depart
as
if
thou
wert
merely
a
friend
bent
on
some
of
the
idle
pleasantries
of
the
hour
the
bravo
resumed
his
disguise
with
the
readiness
of
one
long
practised
in
its
use
but
with
a
composure
that
was
not
so
easily
disconcerted
as
that
of
the
more
sensitive
senator
the
latter
did
not
speak
again
though
he
hurried
jacopo
from
his
presence
by
an
impatient
movement
of
the
hand
when
the
door
was
closed
and
the
signor
gradenigo
was
again
alone
he
once
more
consulted
the
passed
his
hand
slowly
and
thoughtfully
across
his
brow
and
resumed
his
walk
for
nearly
an
hour
this
exercise
or
nervous
sympathy
of
the
body
with
a
mind
that
was
possibly
overworked
continued
without
any
interruption
from
without
then
came
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
and
at
the
usual
bidding
one
entered
closely
masked
like
him
who
had
departed
as
was
so
much
the
usage
of
that
city
in
the
age
of
which
we
write
a
glance
at
the
figure
of
his
guest
seemed
to
apprise
the
senator
of
his
character
for
the
reception
while
it
was
distinguished
by
the
quaint
courtesy
of
the
age
was
that
of
one
expected
i
am
honored
in
the
visit
of
don
camillo
monforte
said
the
host
while
the
individual
named
laid
aside
his
cloak
and
silken
visor
though
the
lateness
of
the
hour
had
given
me
reason
to
apprehend
that
some
casualty
had
interfered
between
me
and
the
pleasure
a
thousand
excuses
noble
senator
but
the
coolness
of
the
canals
and
the
gaiety
of
the
square
together
with
some
apprehension
of
intruding
prematurely
on
time
so
precious
has
i
fear
kept
me
out
of
season
but
i
trust
to
the
known
goodness
of
the
signor
gradenigo
for
my
apology
the
punctuality
of
the
great
lords
of
lower
italy
is
not
their
greatest
merit
the
signor
gradenigo
drily
answered
the
young
esteem
life
so
endless
that
they
take
little
heed
of
the
minutes
that
escape
them
while
we
whom
age
begins
to
menace
think
chiefly
of
repairing
the
omissions
of
youth
in
this
manner
signor
duca
does
man
sin
and
repent
daily
until
the
opportunities
of
doing
either
are
imperceptibly
lost
but
we
will
not
be
more
prodigal
of
the
moments
than
there
is
need
are
we
to
hope
for
better
views
of
the
spaniard
i
have
neglected
little
that
can
move
the
mind
of
a
reasonable
man
and
i
have
in
particular
laid
before
him
the
advantage
of
conciliating
the
senate
esteem
therein
have
you
done
wisely
signore
both
as
respects
his
interests
and
your
own
the
senate
is
a
liberal
paymaster
to
him
who
serves
it
well
and
a
fearful
enemy
to
those
who
do
harm
to
the
state
i
hope
the
matter
of
the
succession
draws
near
a
conclusion
i
wish
it
were
possible
to
say
it
did
i
urge
the
tribunal
in
all
proper
assiduity
omitting
no
duty
of
personal
respect
nor
of
private
solicitation
padua
has
not
a
doctor
more
learned
than
he
who
presents
my
right
to
their
wisdom
and
yet
the
affair
lingers
like
life
in
the
hectic
if
i
have
not
shown
myself
a
worthy
son
of
mark
in
this
affair
with
the
spaniard
it
is
more
from
the
want
of
a
habit
of
managing
political
interests
than
from
any
want
of
zeal
the
scales
of
justice
must
be
nicely
balanced
to
hang
so
long
without
determining
to
one
side
or
the
other
you
will
have
need
of
further
assiduity
don
camillo
and
of
great
discretion
in
disposing
the
minds
of
the
patricians
in
your
favor
it
will
be
well
to
make
your
attachment
to
the
state
be
observed
by
further
service
near
the
ambassador
you
are
known
to
have
his
esteem
and
counsel
coming
from
such
a
quarter
will
enter
deeply
into
his
mind
it
should
also
quicken
the
exertions
of
so
benevolent
and
generous
a
young
spirit
to
know
that
in
serving
his
country
he
also
aids
the
cause
of
humanity
don
camillo
did
not
appear
to
be
strongly
impressed
with
the
justice
of
the
latter
remark
he
bowed
however
in
courtesy
to
his
opinion
it
is
pleasant
signore
to
be
thus
persuaded
he
answered
my
kinsman
of
castile
is
a
man
to
hear
reason
let
it
come
from
what
quarter
it
may
though
he
meets
my
arguments
with
some
allusions
to
the
declining
power
of
the
republic
i
do
not
see
less
of
deep
respect
for
the
influence
of
a
state
that
hath
long
made
itself
remarkable
by
its
energy
and
will
venice
is
no
longer
what
the
city
of
the
isles
hath
been
signer
duca
still
she
is
not
powerless
the
wings
of
our
lion
are
a
little
clipped
but
his
leap
is
still
far
and
his
teeth
dangerous
if
the
prince
would
have
his
ducal
coronet
sit
easily
on
his
brow
he
would
do
well
to
secure
the
esteem
of
his
nearest
neighbors
this
is
obviously
true
and
little
that
my
influence
can
do
towards
effecting
the
object
shall
be
wanting
and
now
may
i
entreat
of
your
friendship
advice
as
to
the
manner
of
further
urging
my
own
claims
you
will
do
well
don
camillo
to
remind
the
senators
of
your
presence
by
frequent
observance
of
the
courtesies
due
to
their
rank
and
yours
this
do
i
never
neglect
as
seemly
both
in
my
station
and
my
object
the
judges
should
not
be
forgotten
young
man
for
it
is
wise
to
remember
that
justice
hath
ever
an
ear
for
solicitation
none
can
be
more
assiduous
in
the
duty
nor
is
it
common
to
see
a
suppliant
so
mindful
of
those
whom
he
troubleth
by
more
substantial
proofs
of
respect
but
chiefly
should
we
be
particular
to
earn
the
senate
esteem
no
act
of
service
to
the
state
is
overlooked
by
that
body
and
the
smallest
good
deed
finds
its
way
into
the
recesses
of
the
two
councils
would
i
could
have
communication
with
those
reverend
fathers
i
think
the
justice
of
my
claim
would
speedily
work
out
its
own
right
that
were
impossible
gravely
returned
the
senator
those
august
bodies
are
secret
that
their
majesty
may
not
be
tarnished
by
communication
with
vulgar
interests
they
rule
like
the
unseen
influence
of
mind
over
matter
and
form
as
it
were
the
soul
of
the
state
whose
seat
like
that
of
reason
remains
a
problem
exceeding
human
penetration
i
express
the
desire
rather
as
a
wish
than
with
any
hope
of
its
being
granted
returned
the
duke
of
agata
resuming
his
cloak
and
mask
neither
of
which
had
been
entirely
laid
aside
adieu
noble
signore
i
shall
not
cease
to
move
the
castilian
with
frequent
advice
and
in
return
i
commit
my
affair
to
the
justice
of
the
patricians
and
your
own
good
friendship
signor
gradenigo
bowed
his
guest
through
all
the
rooms
of
the
long
suite
but
the
last
where
he
committed
him
to
the
care
of
the
groom
of
his
chambers
the
youth
must
be
stirred
to
greater
industry
in
this
matter
by
clogging
the
wheels
of
the
law
he
that
would
ask
favors
of
mark
must
first
earn
them
by
showing
zealous
dispositions
in
his
behalf
such
were
the
reflections
of
the
signor
gradenigo
as
he
slowly
returned
towards
his
closet
after
a
ceremonious
with
his
guest
in
the
outer
apartment
closing
the
door
he
commenced
pacing
the
small
apartment
with
the
step
and
eye
of
a
man
who
again
mused
with
some
anxiety
after
a
minute
of
profound
stillness
a
door
concealed
by
the
hangings
of
the
room
was
cautiously
opened
and
the
face
of
still
another
visitor
appeared
enter
said
the
senator
betraying
no
surprise
at
the
apparition
the
hour
is
past
and
i
wait
for
thee
the
flowing
dress
the
grey
and
venerable
beard
the
noble
outline
of
features
the
quick
greedy
and
suspicious
eye
with
an
expression
of
countenance
that
was
perhaps
equally
marked
by
worldly
sagacity
and
feelings
often
rudely
rebuked
proclaimed
a
hebrew
of
the
rialto
enter
hosea
and
unburden
thyself
continued
the
senator
like
one
prepared
for
some
habitual
communication
is
there
aught
new
that
touches
the
public
weal
blessed
is
the
people
over
whom
there
is
so
fatherly
a
care
can
there
be
good
or
evil
to
the
citizen
of
the
republic
noble
signore
without
the
bowels
of
the
senate
moving
as
the
parent
yearneth
over
his
young
happy

the
country
in
which
men
of
reverend
years
and
whitened
heads
watch
until
night
draws
towards
the
day
and
weariness
is
forgotten
in
the
desire
to
do
good
and
to
honor
the
state
thy
mind
partaketh
of
the
eastern
imagery
of
the
country
of
thy
fathers
good
hosea
and
thou
art
apt
to
forget
that
thou
art
not
yet
watching
on
the
steps
of
the
temple
what
of
interest
hath
the
day
brought
forth
say
rather
the
night
signore
for
little
worthy
of
your
ear
hath
happened
save
a
matter
of
some
trifling
import
which
hath
grown
out
of
the
movements
of
the
evening
have
there
been
stilettoes
busy
on
the
bridge
ha
or
do
the
people
joy
less
than
common
in
their
levities
none
have
died
wrongfully
and
the
square
is
gay
as
the
fragrant
vineyards
of
engedi
holy
abraham
what
a
place
is
venice
for
its
pleasures
and
how
the
hearts
of
old
and
young
revel
in
their
merriment
it
is
almost
sufficient
to
fix
the
font
in
the
synagogue
to
witness
so
joyous
a
dispensation
in
behalf
of
the
people
of
these
islands
i
had
not
hoped
for
the
honor
of
an
interview
signore
and
i
had
prayed
before
laying
my
head
upon
the
pillow
when
one
charged
by
the
council
brought
to
me
a
jewel
with
an
order
to
decipher
the
arms
and
other
symbols
of
its
owner
is
a
ring
with
the
usual
marks
which
accompany
private
confidences
thou
hast
the
signet
said
the
noble
stretching
out
an
arm
it
is
here
and
a
goodly
stone
it
is
a
turquoise
of
price
whence
came
it
and
why
is
it
sent
to
thee
it
came
signore
as
i
gather
more
through
hints
and
intimations
of
the
messenger
than
by
his
words
from
a
place
resembling
that
which
the
righteous
daniel
escaped
in
virtue
of
his
godliness
and
birth
thou
meanest
the
lion
mouth
so
say
our
ancient
books
signore
in
reference
to
the
prophet
and
so
would
the
council
agent
seem
to
intimate
in
reference
to
the
ring
here
is
naught
but
a
crest
with
the
equestrian
helmet
comes
it
of
any
in
venice
the
upright
solomon
guided
the
judgment
of
his
servant
in
a
matter
of
this
delicacy
the
jewel
is
of
rare
beauty
such
as
few
possess
but
those
who
have
gold
in
store
for
other
purposes
do
but
regard
the
soft
lustre
in
this
light
noble
signore
and
remark
the
pleasing
colors
that
rise
by
the
change
of
view
ay
is
well
but
who
claimeth
the
bearings
it
is
wonderful
to
contemplate
how
great
a
value
may
lie
concealed
in
so
small
a
compass
i
have
known
sequins
of
full
weight
and
heavy
amount
given
for
baubles
less
precious
wilt
thou
never
forget
thy
stall
and
the
wayfarers
of
the
rialto
i
bid
thee
name
him
who
beareth
these
symbols
as
marks
of
his
family
and
rank
noble
signore
i
obey
the
crest
is
of
the
family
of
monforte
the
last
senator
of
which
died
some
fifteen
years
since
and
his
jewels
they
have
passed
with
other
movables
of
which
the
state
taketh
no
account
into
the
keeping
of
his
kinsman
and
successor
if
it
be
the
senate
pleasure
that
there
shall
be
a
successor
to
that
ancient
name
don
camillo
of
agata
the
wealthy
neapolitan
who
now
urges
his
rights
here
in
venice
is
the
present
owner
of
this
precious
stone
give
me
the
ring
this
must
be
looked
to
hast
thou
more
to
say
nothing
signore
unless
to
petition
if
there
is
to
be
any
condemnation
and
sale
of
the
jewel
that
it
may
first
be
offered
to
an
ancient
servitor
of
the
republic
who
hath
much
reason
to
regret
that
his
age
hath
been
less
prosperous
than
his
youth
thou
shalt
not
be
forgotten
i
hear
it
said
hosea
that
divers
of
our
young
nobles
frequent
thy
hebrew
shops
with
intent
to
borrow
gold
which
lavished
in
present
prodigality
is
to
be
bitterly
repaid
at
a
later
day
by
and
such
embarrassments
as
suit
not
the
heirs
of
noble
names
take
heed
of
this
matter
for
if
the
displeasure
of
the
council
should
alight
on
any
of
thy
race
there
would
be
long
and
serious
accounts
to
settle
hast
thou
had
employment
of
late
with
other
signets
besides
this
of
the
neapolitan
unless
in
the
vulgar
way
of
our
daily
occupation
none
of
note
illustrious
signore
regard
this
continued
the
signor
gradenigo
first
searching
in
a
secret
drawer
whence
he
drew
a
small
bit
of
paper
to
which
a
morsel
of
wax
adhered
canst
thou
form
any
conjecture
by
the
impression
concerning
him
who
used
that
seal
the
jeweller
took
the
paper
and
held
it
towards
the
light
while
his
glittering
eyes
intently
examined
the
conceit
this
would
surpass
the
wisdom
of
the
son
of
david
he
said
after
a
long
and
seemingly
fruitless
examination
here
is
naught
but
some
fanciful
device
of
gallantry
such
as
the
cavaliers
of
the
city
are
fond
of
using
when
they
tempt
the
weaker
sex
with
fair
words
and
seductive
vanities
it
is
a
heart
pierced
with
the
dart
of
love
and
the
motto
of
al
cuore
trafitto
naught
else
as
my
eyes
do
their
duty
i
should
think
there
was
but
very
little
meant
by
those
words
signore
that
as
may
be
thou
hast
never
sold
a
jewel
with
that
conceit
just
samuel
we
dispose
of
them
daily
to
christians
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
i
know
no
device
of
greater
frequency
whereby
i
conceive
there
is
much
commerce
in
this
light
fidelity
he
who
used
it
did
well
in
concealing
his
thoughts
beneath
so
general
a
dress
there
will
be
a
reward
of
a
hundred
sequins
to
him
who
traces
the
owner
hosea
was
about
to
return
the
seal
as
beyond
his
knowledge
when
this
remark
fell
casually
from
the
lips
of
the
signor
gradenigo
in
a
moment
his
eyes
were
fortified
with
a
glass
of
microscopic
power
and
the
paper
was
again
before
the
lamp
i
disposed
of
a
cornelian
of
no
great
price
which
bore
this
conceit
to
the
wife
of
the
emperor
ambassador
but
conceiving
there
was
no
more
in
the
purchase
than
some
waywardness
of
fancy
i
took
no
precaution
to
note
the
stone
a
gentleman
in
the
family
of
the
legate
of
ravenna
also
trafficked
with
me
for
an
amethyst
of
the
same
design
but
with
him
neither
did
i
hold
it
important
to
be
particular
ha
here
is
a
private
mark
that
in
truth
seemeth
to
be
of
my
own
hand
dost
thou
find
a
clue
what
is
the
sign
of
which
thou
speakest
naught
noble
senator
but
a
slur
in
a
letter
which
would
not
be
apt
to
catch
the
eye
of
an
maiden
and
thou
parted
with
the
seal
to
hosea
hesitated
for
he
foresaw
some
danger
of
losing
his
reward
by
a
too
hasty
communication
of
the
truth
if
it
be
important
that
the
fact
be
known
signore
he
said
i
will
consult
my
books
in
a
matter
of
this
gravity
the
senate
should
not
be
misled
thou
sayest
well
the
affair
is
grave
and
the
reward
a
sufficient
pledge
that
we
so
esteem
it
something
was
said
illustrious
signore
of
a
hundred
sequins
but
my
mind
taketh
little
heed
of
such
particulars
when
the
good
of
venice
is
in
question
a
hundred
is
the
sum
i
promised
i
parted
with
a
bearing
some
such
design
to
a
female
in
the
service
of
the
nuncio
first
gentleman
but
this
seal
can
not
come
of
that
since
a
woman
of
her
station
art
sure
eagerly
interrupted
the
signor
gradenigo
hosea
looked
earnestly
at
his
companion
and
reading
in
his
eye
and
countenance
that
the
clue
was
agreeable
he
answered
promptly
as
that
i
live
under
the
law
of
moses
the
bauble
had
been
long
on
hand
without
an
offer
and
i
abandoned
it
to
the
uses
of
my
money
the
sequins
are
thine
excellent
jew
this
clears
the
mystery
of
every
doubt
go
thou
shalt
have
thy
reward
and
if
thou
hast
any
particulars
in
thy
secret
register
let
me
be
quickly
possessed
of
them
go
to
good
hosea
and
be
punctual
as
of
wont
i
tire
of
these
constant
exercises
of
the
spirit
the
hebrew
exulting
in
his
success
now
took
his
leave
with
a
manner
in
which
habitual
cupidity
and
subdued
policy
completely
mastered
every
other
feeling
he
disappeared
by
the
passage
through
which
he
had
entered
it
seemed
by
the
manner
of
the
signor
gradenigo
that
the
receptions
for
that
evening
had
now
ended
he
carefully
examined
the
locks
of
several
secret
drawers
in
his
cabinet
extinguished
the
lights
closed
and
secured
the
doors
and
quitted
the
place
for
some
time
longer
however
he
paced
one
of
the
principal
rooms
of
the
outer
suite
until
the
usual
hour
having
arrived
he
sought
his
rest
and
the
palace
was
closed
for
the
night
the
reader
will
have
gained
some
insight
into
the
character
of
the
individual
who
was
the
chief
actor
in
the
foregoing
scenes
the
signor
gradenigo
was
born
with
all
the
sympathies
and
natural
kindliness
of
other
men
but
accident
and
an
education
which
had
received
a
strong
bias
from
the
institutions
of
the
republic
had
made
him
the
creature
of
a
conventional
policy
to
him
venice
seemed
a
free
state
because
he
partook
so
largely
of
the
benefits
of
her
social
system
and
though
shrewd
and
practised
in
most
of
the
affairs
of
the
world
his
faculties
on
the
subject
of
the
political
ethics
of
his
country
were
possessed
of
a
rare
and
accommodating
dulness
a
senator
he
stood
in
relation
to
the
state
as
a
director
of
a
moneyed
institution
is
proverbially
placed
in
respect
to
his
corporation
an
agent
of
its
collective
measures
removed
from
the
responsibilities
of
the
man
he
could
reason
warmly
if
not
acutely
concerning
the
principles
of
government
and
it
would
be
difficult
even
in
this
age
to
find
a
more
zealous
convert
to
the
opinion
that
property
was
not
a
subordinate
but
the
absorbing
interest
of
civilized
life
he
would
talk
ably
of
character
and
honor
and
virtue
and
religion
and
the
rights
of
persons
but
when
called
upon
to
act
in
their
behalf
there
was
in
his
mind
a
tendency
to
blend
them
all
with
worldly
policy
that
proved
as
unerring
as
the
gravitation
of
matter
to
the
earth
centre
as
a
venetian
he
was
equally
opposed
to
the
domination
of
one
or
of
the
whole
being
as
respects
the
first
a
furious
republican
and
in
reference
to
the
last
leaning
to
that
singular
sophism
which
calls
the
dominion
of
the
majority
the
rule
of
many
tyrants
in
short
he
was
an
aristocrat
and
no
man
had
more
industriously
or
more
successfully
persuaded
himself
into
the
belief
of
all
the
dogmas
that
were
favorable
to
his
caste
he
was
a
powerful
advocate
of
vested
rights
for
their
possession
was
advantageous
to
himself
he
was
sensitively
alive
to
innovations
on
usages
and
to
vicissitudes
in
the
histories
of
families
for
calculation
had
substituted
taste
for
principles
nor
was
he
backward
on
occasion
in
defending
his
opinions
by
analogies
drawn
from
the
decrees
of
providence
with
a
philosophy
that
seemed
to
satisfy
himself
he
contended
that
as
god
had
established
orders
throughout
his
own
creation
in
a
descending
chain
from
angels
to
men
it
was
safe
to
follow
an
example
which
emanated
from
a
wisdom
that
was
infinite
nothing
could
be
more
sound
than
the
basis
of
his
theory
though
its
application
had
the
capital
error
of
believing
there
was
any
imitation
of
nature
in
an
endeavor
to
supplant
it

the

nothing
now

where
the
lamp
of

shone
faintly
rogers
just
as
the
secret
audiences
of
the
palazzo
gradenigo
were
ended
the
great
square
of

began
to
lose
a
portion
of
its
gaiety
the
cafés
were
now
occupied
by
parties
who
had
the
means
and
were
in
the
humor
to
put
their
indulgences
to
more
substantial
proof
than
the

idle
laugh

who
were
reluctantly
compelled
to
turn
their

to
the
cares

were
departing
in
crowds
to

there
remained
one
of
the
latter
class
however
who
continued
to
occupy
a
spot
near
the

squares
as
motionless
as

grew
to
the

the
whole
of

bronzed
features
beneath
the
rays
of

the
dark
anxious
and
stern
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
mild
orb
as
if
their
owner
sought
to
penetrate
into
another
world
in
quest
of
that
peace
which
he
had
never
known
in
this
there
was
suffering
in
the
expression
of
the
face

it
was
the
suffering
of
one
whose
native
sensibilities
had
been
a
little
deadened
by
too
much
familiarity
with
the
lot
of
the
feeble
to
one
who
considered
life
and
humanity
in
any
other
than
their
familiar
and
vulgar
aspects
he
would
have
presented
a
touching
picture
of
a
noble
nature
enduring
with
pride
blunted
by
habit
while
to
him
who
regards
the
accidental
dispositions
of
society
as
paramount
laws
he
might
have
presented
the
image
of
dogged
turbulence
and
discontent
healthfully
repressed

the
hand

heavy
sigh
struggled
from
the
chest
of
the

man
and
stroking
down
the
few
hairs
which
time
had
left
him
he
lifted
his
cap
from
the
pavement
and
prepared
to
move
thou
art
late
from
thy
bed
antonio
said
a
voice
at
his
elbow
the
triglie
must
be
of
good
price
or
of
great
plenty
that
one
of
thy
trade
can
spare
time
to
air
himself
in
the
piazza
at
this
hour
thou
hearest
the
clock
is
telling
the
fifth
hour
of
the
night
the
fisherman
bent
his
head
aside
and
regarded
the
figure
of
his
masked
companion
for
a
moment
with
indifference
betraying
neither
curiosity
nor
feeling
at
his
address
since
thou
knowest
me
he
answered
it
is
probable
thou
knowest
that
in
quitting
this
place
i
shall
go
to
an
empty
dwelling
since
thou
knowest
me
so
well
thou
also
know
my
wrongs
who
hath
injured
thee
worthy
fisherman
that
thou
speakest
so
boldly
beneath
the
very
windows
of
the
doge
the
state
this
is
hardy
language
for
the
ear
of
mark
were
it
too
loudly
spoken
yonder
lion
might
growl
of
what
dost
thou
accuse
the
republic
lead
me
to
them
that
sent
thee
and
i
will
spare
the
trouble
of
a
i
am
ready
to
tell
my
wrongs
to
the
doge
on
his
throne
for
what
can
one
poor
and
old
as
i
dread
from
their
anger
thou
believest
me
sent
to
betray
thee
thou
knowest
thine
own
errand
the
other
removed
his
mask
and
turned
his
face
towards
the
moon
jacopo
exclaimed
the
fisherman
gazing
at
the
expressive
italian
features
one
of
thy
character
can
have
no
errand
with
me
a
flush
that
was
visible
even
in
that
light
passed
athwart
the
countenance
of
the
bravo
but
he
stilled
every
other
exhibition
of
feeling
thou
art
wrong
my
errand
is
with
thee
does
the
senate
think
a
fisherman
of
the
lagunes
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
struck
by
a
stiletto
do
thy
work
then
he
added
glancing
at
his
brown
and
naked
bosom
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
thee
antonio
thou
dost
me
wrong
the
senate
has
no
such
purpose
but
i
have
heard
that
thou
hast
reason
for
discontent
and
that
thou
speakest
openly
on
the
lido
and
among
the
islands
of
affairs
that
the
patricians
like
not
to
be
stirred
among
men
of
your
class
i
come
as
a
friend
to
warn
thee
of
the
consequences
of
such
indiscretion
rather
than
as
one
to
harm
thee
thou
art
sent
to
say
this
old
man
age
should
teach
thy
tongue
moderation
what
will
avail
vain
complaints
against
the
republic
or
what
canst
thou
hope
for
as
their
fruits
but
evil
to
thyself
and
evil
to
the
child
that
thou
lovest
i
know
not
but
when
the
heart
is
sore
the
tongue
will
speak
they
have
taken
away
my
boy
and
they
have
left
little
behind
that
i
value
the
life
they
threaten
is
too
short
to
be
cared
for
thou
temper
thy
regrets
with
wisdom
the
signor
gradenigo
has
long
been
friendly
to
thee
and
i
have
heard
that
thy
mother
nursed
him
try
his
ears
with
prayers
but
cease
to
anger
the
republic
with
complaints
antonio
looked
wistfully
at
his
companion
but
when
he
had
ceased
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
as
if
to
express
the
hopelessness
of
relief
from
that
quarter
i
have
told
him
all
that
a
man
born
and
nursed
on
the
lagunes
can
find
words
to
say
he
is
a
senator
jacopo
and
he
thinks
not
of
suffering
he
does
not
feel
art
thou
not
wrong
old
man
to
accuse
him
who
hath
been
born
in
affluence
of
hardness
of
heart
merely
that
he
doth
not
feel
the
misery
thou
avoid
too
were
it
in
thy
power
thou
hast
thy
gondola
and
nets
with
health
and
the
cunning
of
thy
art
and
in
that
art
thou
happier
than
he
who
hath
neither
thou
forget
thy
skill
and
share
thy
little
stock
with
the
beggar
of
san
marco
that
your
fortunes
might
be
equal
there
may
be
truth
in
what
thou
sayest
of
our
labor
and
our
means
but
when
it
comes
to
our
young
nature
is
the
same
in
both
i
see
no
reason
why
the
son
of
the
patrician
should
go
free
and
the
child
of
the
fisherman
be
sold
to
blood
have
not
the
senators
enough
of
happiness
in
their
riches
and
greatness
that
they
rob
me
of
my
son
thou
knowest
antonio
the
state
must
be
served
and
were
its
officers
to
go
into
the
palaces
in
quest
of
hardy
mariners
for
the
fleet
would
they
think
you
find
them
that
would
honor
the
winged
lion
in
the
hour
of
his
need
thy
old
arm
is
muscular
and
thy
leg
steady
on
the
water
and
they
seek
those
who
like
thee
have
been
trained
to
the
seas
thou
have
said
also
and
thy
old
breast
is
scarred
before
thy
birth
jacopo
i
went
against
the
infidel
and
my
blood
was
shed
like
water
for
the
state
but
they
have
forgotten
it
while
there
are
rich
marbles
raised
in
the
churches
which
speak
of
what
the
nobles
did
who
came
unharmed
from
the
same
wars
i
have
heard
my
father
say
as
much
returned
the
bravo
gloomily
and
speaking
in
an
altered
voice
he
too
bled
in
that
war
but
that
is
forgotten
the
fisherman
glanced
a
look
around
and
perceiving
that
several
groups
were
conversing
near
in
the
square
he
signed
to
his
companion
to
follow
him
and
walked
towards
the
quays
thy
father
he
said
as
they
moved
slowly
on
together
was
my
comrade
and
my
friend
i
am
old
jacopo
and
poor
my
days
are
passed
in
toil
on
the
lagunes
and
my
nights
in
gaining
strength
to
meet
the
labor
of
the
morrow
but
it
hath
grieved
me
to
hear
that
the
son
of
one
i
much
loved
and
with
whom
i
have
so
often
shared
good
and
evil
fair
and
foul
hath
taken
to
a
life
like
that
which
men
say
is
thine
the
gold
that
is
the
price
of
blood
was
never
yet
blessed
to
him
that
gave
or
him
that
received
the
bravo
listened
in
silence
though
his
companion
who
at
another
moment
and
under
other
emotions
would
have
avoided
him
as
one
shrinks
from
contagion
saw
on
looking
mournfully
up
into
his
face
that
the
muscles
were
slightly
agitated
and
that
a
paleness
crossed
his
cheeks
which
the
light
of
the
moon
rendered
ghastly
thou
hast
suffered
poverty
to
tempt
thee
into
grievous
sin
jacopo
but
it
is
never
too
late
to
call
on
the
saints
for
aid
and
to
lay
aside
the
stiletto
it
is
not
profitable
for
a
man
to
be
known
in
venice
as
thy
fellow
but
the
friend
of
thy
father
will
not
abandon
one
who
shows
a
penitent
spirit
lay
aside
thy
stiletto
and
come
with
me
to
the
lagunes
thou
wilt
find
labor
less
burdensome
than
guilt
and
though
thou
never
canst
be
to
me
like
the
boy
they
have
taken
for
he
was
innocent
as
the
lamb
thou
wilt
still
be
the
son
of
an
ancient
comrade
and
a
stricken
spirit
come
with
me
then
to
the
lagunes
for
poverty
and
misery
like
mine
can
not
meet
with
more
contempt
even
for
being
thy
companion
what
is
it
men
say
that
thou
treatest
me
thus
demanded
jacopo
in
a
low
struggling
voice
i
would
they
said
untruth
but
few
die
by
violence
in
venice
that
thy
name
is
not
uttered
and
would
they
suffer
one
thus
marked
to
go
openly
on
the
canals
or
to
be
at
large
in
the
great
square
of
san
marco
we
never
know
the
reasons
of
the
senate
some
say
thy
time
is
not
yet
come
while
others
think
thou
art
too
powerful
for
judgment
thou
dost
equal
credit
to
the
justice
and
the
activity
of
the
inquisition
but
should
i
go
with
thee
wilt
thou
be
more
discreet
in
speech
among
thy
fellows
of
the
lido
and
the
islands
when
the
heart
hath
its
load
the
tongue
will
strive
to
lighten
it
i
would
do
anything
to
turn
the
child
of
my
friend
from
his
evil
ways
but
forget
my
own
thou
art
used
to
deal
with
the
patricians
jacopo
would
there
be
possibility
for
one
clad
in
this
dress
and
with
a
face
blackened
by
the
sun
to
come
to
speak
with
the
doge
there
is
no
lack
of
seeming
justice
in
venice
antonio
the
want
is
in
the
substance
i
doubt
not
thou
be
heard
then
will
i
wait
here
upon
the
stones
of
the
square
until
he
comes
forth
for
the
pomp
of
and
try
to
move
his
heart
to
justice
he
is
old
like
myself
and
he
hath
bled
too
for
the
state
and
what
is
more
he
is
a
father
so
is
the
signor
gradenigo
thou
doubtest
his
pity
ha
thou
canst
but
try
the
doge
of
venice
will
hearken
to
a
petition
from
the
meanest
citizen
i
think
added
jacopo
speaking
so
low
as
to
be
scarcely
audible
he
would
listen
even
to
me
though
i
am
not
able
to
put
my
prayer
in
such
speech
as
becometh
the
ear
of
a
great
prince
he
shall
hear
the
truth
from
a
wronged
man
they
call
him
the
chosen
of
the
state
and
such
a
one
should
gladly
listen
to
justice
this
is
a
hard
bed
jacopo
continued
the
fisherman
seating
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
column
of
theodore
but
i
have
slept
on
colder
and
as
hard
when
there
was
less
reason
to
do
it
a
happy
night
the
bravo
lingered
a
minute
near
the
old
man
who
folded
his
arms
on
his
naked
breast
which
was
fanned
by
the
and
disposed
of
his
person
to
take
his
rest
in
the
square
a
practice
not
unusual
among
men
of
his
class
but
when
he
found
that
antonio
was
inclined
to
be
alone
he
moved
on
leaving
the
fisherman
to
himself
the
night
was
now
getting
to
be
advanced
and
few
of
the
revellers
remained
in
the
areas
of
the
two
squares
jacopo
cast
a
glance
around
and
noting
the
hour
and
the
situation
of
the
place
he
proceeded
to
the
edge
of
the
quay
the
public
gondoliers
had
left
their
boats
moored
as
usual
at
this
spot
and
a
profound
stillness
reigned
over
the
whole
bay
the
water
was
scarce
darkened
by
the
air
which
rather
breathed
upon
than
ruffled
its
surface
and
no
sound
of
oar
was
audible
amid
the
forest
of
picturesque
and
classical
spars
which
crowded
the
view
between
the
piazzetta
and
the
giudecca
the
bravo
hesitated
cast
another
wary
glance
around
him
settled
his
mask
undid
the
slight
fastenings
of
a
boat
and
presently
he
was
gliding
away
into
the
centre
of
the
basin
who
cometh
demanded
one
who
seemingly
stood
at
watch
in
a
felucca
anchored
a
little
apart
from
all
others
one
expected
was
the
answer
roderigo
the
same
thou
art
late
said
the
mariner
of
calabria
as
jacopo
stepped
upon
the
low
deck
of
the
bella
sorrentina
my
people
have
long
been
below
and
i
have
dreamt
thrice
of
shipwreck
and
twice
of
a
heavy
sirocco
since
thou
hast
been
expected
thou
hast
had
more
time
to
wrong
the
customs
is
the
felucca
ready
for
her
work
as
for
the
customs
there
is
little
chance
of
gain
in
this
greedy
city
the
senators
secure
all
profits
to
themselves
and
their
friends
while
we
of
the
barks
are
tied
down
to
low
freights
and
hard
bargains
i
have
sent
a
dozen
casks
of
lachryma
christi
up
the
canals
since
the
masquers
came
abroad
and
beyond
that
i
have
not
occasion
there
is
enough
left
for
thy
comfort
at
need
wilt
drink
i
am
sworn
to
sobriety
is
thy
vessel
ready
as
wont
for
the
errand
is
the
senate
as
ready
with
its
money
this
is
the
fourth
of
my
voyages
in
their
service
and
they
have
only
to
look
into
their
own
secrets
to
know
the
manner
in
which
the
work
hath
been
done
they
are
content
and
thou
hast
been
well
rewarded
say
it
not
i
have
gained
more
gold
by
one
lucky
shipment
of
fruits
from
the
isles
than
by
all
their
would
those
who
employ
me
give
a
little
especial
traffic
on
the
entrance
of
the
felucca
there
might
be
advantage
in
the
trade
there
is
nothing
which
mark
visits
with
a
heavier
punishment
than
frauds
on
his
receipts
have
a
care
with
thy
wines
or
thou
wilt
lose
not
only
thy
bark
and
thy
voyage
but
thy
liberty
this
is
just
the
ground
of
my
complaint
signor
roderigo
rogue
and
no
rogue
is
the
republic
motto
here
they
are
as
close
in
justice
as
a
father
amid
his
children
and
there
it
is
better
that
what
is
done
should
be
done
at
midnight
i
like
not
the
contradiction
for
just
as
my
hopes
are
a
little
raised
by
what
i
have
witnessed
perhaps
a
little
too
near
they
are
all
blown
to
the
winds
by
such
a
frown
as
san
gennero
himself
might
cast
upon
a
sinner
remember
thou
art
not
in
thy
wide
mediterranean
but
on
a
canal
of
venice
this
language
might
be
unsafe
were
it
heard
by
less
friendly
ears
i
thank
thee
for
thy
care
though
the
sight
of
yonder
old
palace
is
as
good
a
hint
to
the
loose
tongue
as
the
sight
of
a
gibbet
on
the
to
a
pirate
i
met
an
ancient
fellow
in
the
piazzetta
about
the
time
the
masquers
came
in
and
we
had
some
words
on
this
matter
by
his
tally
every
second
man
in
venice
is
well
paid
for
reporting
what
the
others
say
and
do
is
a
pity
with
all
their
seeming
love
of
justice
good
roderigo
that
the
senate
should
let
divers
knaves
go
at
large
men
whose
very
faces
cause
the
stones
to
redden
with
anger
and
shame
i
did
not
know
that
any
such
were
openly
seen
in
venice
what
is
secretly
done
may
be
favored
for
a
time
through
difficulty
of
proof
but
cospetto
they
tell
me
the
councils
have
a
short
manner
of
making
a
sinner
give
up
his
misdeeds
now
here
is
the
miscreant
jacopo
what
aileth
thee
man
the
anchor
on
which
thou
leanest
is
not
heated
nor
is
it
of
feathers
one
bones
may
ache
from
its
touch
without
offence
i
hope
the
iron
is
of
elba
and
was
forged
in
a
volcano
this
jacopo
is
one
that
should
not
go
at
large
in
an
honest
city
and
yet
is
he
seen
pacing
the
square
with
as
much
ease
as
a
noble
in
the
broglio
i
know
him
not
not
to
know
the
boldest
hand
and
surest
stiletto
in
venice
honest
roderigo
is
to
thy
praise
but
he
is
well
marked
among
us
of
the
port
and
we
never
see
the
man
but
we
begin
to
think
of
our
sins
and
of
penances
forgotten
i
marvel
much
that
the
inquisitors
do
not
give
him
to
the
devil
on
some
public
ceremony
for
the
benefit
of
small
offenders
are
his
deeds
so
notorious
that
they
might
pronounce
on
his
fate
without
proof
go
ask
that
question
in
the
streets
not
a
christian
loses
his
life
in
venice
without
warning
and
the
number
is
not
few
to
say
nothing
of
those
who
die
with
state
fevers
but
men
see
the
work
of
his
sure
hand
in
the
blow
signor
roderigo
your
canals
are
convenient
graves
for
sudden
deaths
methinks
there
is
contradiction
in
this
thou
speakest
of
proofs
of
the
hand
that
gave
it
in
the
manner
of
the
blow
and
then
thou
callest
in
the
aid
of
the
canals
to
cover
the
whole
deed
truly
there
is
some
wrong
done
this
jacopo
who
is
haply
a
man
slandered
i
have
heard
of
slandering
a
priest
for
they
are
christians
bound
to
keep
good
names
for
the
church
honor
but
to
utter
an
injury
against
a
bravo
would
a
little
exceed
the
tongue
of
an
avocato
what
mattereth
it
whether
the
hand
be
a
shade
deeper
in
color
or
not
when
blood
is
on
it
thou
sayest
truly
answered
the
pretended
roderigo
drawing
a
heavy
breath
it
mattereth
little
indeed
to
him
condemned
whether
the
sentence
cometh
of
one
or
of
many
crimes
dost
know
friend
roderigo
that
this
very
argument
hath
made
me
less
scrupulous
concerning
the
freight
i
am
called
on
to
carry
in
this
secret
trade
of
ours
thou
art
fairly
in
the
senate
business
worthy
stefano
i
say
to
myself
and
therefore
the
less
reason
that
thou
be
particular
in
the
quality
of
the
merchandise
that
jacopo
hath
an
eye
and
a
scowl
that
would
betray
him
were
he
chosen
to
the
chair
of
peter
but
doff
thy
mask
signor
roderigo
that
the
may
cool
thy
cheek
is
time
there
should
no
longer
be
this
suspicion
between
old
and
tried
friends
my
duty
to
those
that
send
me
forbid
the
liberty
else
would
i
gladly
stand
face
to
face
with
thee
master
stefano
well
notwithstanding
thy
caution
cunning
signore
i
would
hazard
ten
of
the
sequins
thou
art
to
pay
to
me
that
i
will
go
on
the
morrow
into
the
crowd
of
san
marco
and
challenge
thee
openly
by
name
among
a
thousand
thou
mayest
as
well
unmask
for
i
tell
thee
thou
art
as
well
known
to
me
as
the
lateen
yards
of
my
felucca
the
less
need
to
uncover
there
are
certain
signs
no
doubt
by
which
men
who
meet
so
often
should
be
known
to
each
other
thou
hast
a
goodly
countenance
signore
and
the
less
need
to
hide
it
i
have
noted
thee
among
the
revellers
when
thou
hast
thought
thyself
unseen
and
i
will
say
of
thee
this
much
without
wish
to
gain
aught
in
our
bargain
one
of
appearance
fair
as
thine
signor
roderigo
had
better
be
seen
openly
than
go
thus
for
ever
behind
a
cloud
my
answer
hath
been
made
what
the
state
wills
can
not
be
overlooked
but
since
i
see
thou
knowest
me
take
heed
not
to
betray
thy
knowledge
thou
not
be
more
safe
with
thy
confessor
diamine
i
am
not
a
man
to
gad
about
among
the
with
a
secret
at
the
top
of
my
voice
but
thou
didst
leer
aside
when
i
winked
at
thee
dancing
among
the
masquers
on
the
quay
is
it
not
so
roderigo
there
is
more
cleverness
in
thee
master
stefano
than
i
had
thought
though
thy
readiness
with
the
felucca
is
no
secret
there
are
two
things
signor
roderigo
on
which
i
value
myself
but
always
i
hope
with
christian
moderation
as
a
mariner
of
the
coast
in
mistral
or
sirocco
levanter
or
zephyr
few
can
claim
more
practice
and
for
knowing
an
acquaintance
in
a
carnival
i
believe
the
father
of
evil
himself
could
not
be
so
disguised
that
eye
of
mine
should
not
see
his
foot
for
anticipating
a
gale
or
looking
behind
a
mask
signor
roderigo
i
know
not
my
own
equal
among
men
of
small
learning
these
faculties
are
great
gifts
in
one
who
liveth
by
the
sea
and
a
critical
trade
here
came
one
gino
a
gondolier
of
don
camillo
monforte
and
an
ancient
fellow
of
mine
aboard
the
felucca
attended
by
a
woman
in
mask
he
threw
off
the
girl
dexterously
enough
and
as
he
thought
among
strangers
but
i
knew
her
at
a
glance
for
the
daughter
of
a
who
had
already
tasted
lachryma
christi
of
mine
the
woman
was
angered
at
the
trick
but
making
the
best
of
luck
we
drove
a
bargain
for
the
few
casks
which
lay
beneath
the
ballast
while
gino
did
his
business
in
san
marco
and
what
that
business
was
thou
didst
not
learn
good
stefano
how
should
i
master
roderigo
when
the
gondolier
scarce
left
time
for
greeting
but
annina
annina
the
same
thou
knowest
annina
old
tomaso
daughter
for
she
danced
in
the
very
set
in
which
i
detected
thy
countenance
i
would
not
speak
thus
of
the
girl
but
that
i
know
thou
art
not
backward
to
receive
liquors
that
do
not
visit
the
thyself
for
that
fear
nothing
i
have
sworn
to
thee
that
no
secret
of
this
nature
shall
pass
my
lips
but
this
annina
is
a
girl
of
quick
wit
and
much
boldness
between
ourselves
signor
roderigo
it
is
not
easy
to
tell
who
is
in
the
senate
pay
here
in
venice
or
who
is
not
i
have
sometimes
fancied
by
thy
manner
of
starting
and
the
tones
of
thy
voice
that
thou
wert
thyself
no
less
than
the
of
the
galleys
a
little
disguised
and
this
with
thy
knowledge
of
men
if
faith
were
always
equal
where
would
be
its
merit
thou
hast
never
been
hotly
chased
by
an
infidel
master
roderigo
or
thou
know
how
the
mind
of
man
can
change
from
hope
to
fear
from
the
big
voice
to
the
humble
prayer
i
remember
once
in
the
confusion
and
hurry
of
baffling
winds
and
whistling
shot
having
always
turbans
before
the
eye
and
the
bastinado
in
mind
to
have
beseeched
stefano
in
some
such
voice
as
one
would
use
to
a
dog
and
to
have
bullied
the
men
with
the
whine
of
a
young
kitten
corpo
di
bacco
one
hath
need
of
experience
in
these
affairs
signor
roderigo
to
know
even
his
own
merits
i
believe
thee
but
who
is
this
gino
of
whom
thou
hast
spoken
and
what
has
his
occupation
as
a
gondolier
to
do
with
one
known
in
thy
youth
in
calabria
therein
lie
matters
exceeding
my
knowledge
his
master
and
i
may
say
my
master
for
i
was
born
on
his
estates
is
the
young
duca
di
agata
the
same
that
pushes
his
fortunes
with
the
senate
in
a
claim
to
the
riches
and
honors
of
the
last
monforte
that
sat
in
thy
councils
the
debate
hath
so
long
endured
that
the
lad
hath
made
himself
a
gondolier
by
sheer
shoving
an
oar
between
his
master
palace
and
those
of
the
nobles
he
moves
with
interest
at
least
such
is
gino
own
history
of
his
education
i
know
the
man
he
wears
the
colors
of
him
he
serves
is
he
of
quick
wit
signor
roderigo
all
who
come
of
calabria
can
not
boast
that
advantage
we
are
no
more
than
our
neighbors
and
there
are
exceptions
in
all
communities
as
in
all
families
gino
is
ready
enough
with
his
oar
and
as
good
a
youth
in
his
way
as
need
be
but
as
to
looking
into
things
beyond
their
surface
why
we
should
not
expect
the
delicacy
of
a
beccafica
in
a
goose
nature
makes
men
though
kings
make
nobles
gino
is
a
gondolier
and
of
good
skill
i
say
nothing
of
his
arm
or
his
leg
both
of
which
are
well
enough
in
their
places
but
when
it
comes
to
knowing
men
and
things
poor
gino
is
but
a
gondolier
the
lad
hath
a
most
excellent
heart
and
is
never
backward
to
serve
a
friend
i
love
him
but
thou
not
have
me
say
more
than
the
truth
will
warrant
well
keep
thy
felucca
in
readiness
for
we
know
not
the
moment
it
may
be
needed
thou
hast
only
to
bring
thy
freight
signore
to
have
the
bargain
fulfilled
adieu
i
would
recommend
to
thee
to
keep
apart
from
all
other
trades
and
to
see
that
the
revelries
of
do
not
debauch
thy
people
god
speed
thee
signor
roderigo
naught
shall
be
wanting
the
bravo
stepped
into
his
gondola
which
glided
from
the
felucca
side
with
a
facility
which
showed
that
an
arm
skilled
in
its
use
held
the
oar
he
waved
his
hand
in
adieu
to
stefano
and
then
the
boat
disappeared
among
the
hulls
that
crowded
the
port
for
a
few
minutes
the
padrone
of
the
bella
sorrentina
continued
to
pace
her
decks
snuffing
the
fresh
breeze
that
came
in
over
the
lido
and
then
he
sought
his
rest
by
this
time
the
dark
silent
gondolas
which
had
been
floating
by
hundreds
through
the
basin
were
all
gone
the
sound
of
music
was
heard
no
longer
on
the
canals
and
venice
at
all
times
noiseless
and
peculiar
seemed
to
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
dead
chapter
viii
the
fisher
came
from
his
green
islet
bringing
the
waves
his
wife
and
little
one
the
husbandman
from
the
firm
land
with
many
a
friar
and
nun
and
village
maiden
her
first
flight
from
home
crowding
the
common
ferry
rogers
a
brighter
day
than
that
which
succeeded
the
night
last
mentioned
never
dawned
upon
the
massive
domes
the
gorgeous
palaces
and
the
glittering
canals
of
venice
the
sun
had
not
been
long
above
the
level
of
the
lido
before
the
strains
of
horns
and
trumpets
arose
from
the
square
of
mark
they
were
answered
in
full
echoes
from
the
distant
arsenal
a
thousand
gondolas
glided
from
the
canals
stealing
in
every
direction
across
the
port
the
giudecca
and
the
various
outer
channels
of
the
place
while
the
well
known
routes
from
fusina
and
the
neighboring
isles
were
dotted
with
endless
lines
of
boats
urging
their
way
towards
the
capital
the
citizens
began
to
assemble
early
in
their
holiday
attire
while
thousands
of
contadini
landed
at
the
different
bridges
clad
in
the
gay
costumes
of
the
main
before
the
day
had
far
advanced
all
the
avenues
of
the
great
square
were
again
thronged
and
by
the
time
the
bells
of
the
venerable
cathedral
had
finished
a
peal
of
high
rejoicing
mark
again
teemed
with
its
gay
multitude
few
appeared
in
masks
but
pleasure
seemed
to
lighten
every
eye
while
the
frank
and
unconcealed
countenance
willingly
courted
the
observation
and
sympathy
of
its
neighbors
in
short
venice
and
her
people
were
seen
in
all
the
gaiety
and
carelessness
of
a
favorite
italian
festa
the
banners
of
the
conquered
nations
flapped
heavily
on
the
triumphal
masts
each
hung
out
its
image
of
the
winged
lion
and
every
palace
was
rich
in
its
hangings
of
tapestry
and
silk
floating
from
balcony
and
window
in
the
midst
of
this
exhilarating
and
bright
spectacle
was
heard
the
din
of
a
hundred
thousand
voices
above
the
constant
hum
there
arose
from
time
to
time
the
blasts
of
trumpets
and
the
symphonies
of
rich
music
here
the
improvisatore
secretly
employed
by
a
politic
and
mysterious
government
recounted
with
a
rapid
utterance
and
in
language
suited
to
the
popular
ear
at
the
foot
of
the
spars
which
upheld
the
conquered
banners
of
candia
crete
and
the
morea
the
ancient
triumphs
of
the
republic
while
there
a
chanted
to
the
greedy
crowd
the
glory
and
justice
of
san
marco
shouts
of
approbation
succeeded
each
happy
allusion
to
the
national
renown
and
bravos
loud
and
were
the
reward
of
the
agents
of
the
police
whenever
they
most
administered
to
the
and
vanity
of
their
audience
in
the
meantime
gondolas
rich
in
carvings
and
gildings
and
containing
females
renowned
for
grace
and
beauty
began
to
cluster
in
hundreds
around
the
port
a
general
movement
had
already
taken
place
among
the
shipping
and
a
wide
and
clear
channel
was
opened
from
the
quay
at
the
foot
of
the
piazzetta
to
the
distant
bank
which
shut
out
the
waves
of
the
adriatic
near
this
watery
path
boats
of
all
sizes
and
descriptions
filled
with
the
curious
and
observant
were
fast
collecting
the
crowd
thickened
as
the
day
drew
in
all
the
vast
plains
of
the
padovano
appearing
to
have
given
up
their
people
to
swell
the
numbers
of
those
that
rejoiced
a
few
timid
and
irresolute
masquers
now
began
to
appear
in
the
throng
stealing
a
momentary
pleasure
under
the
favor
of
that
privileged
disguise
from
out
of
the
seclusion
and
monotony
of
their
cloisters
next
came
the
rich
marine
equipages
of
the
accredited
agents
of
foreign
states
and
then
amid
the
sound
of
clarions
and
the
cries
of
the
populace
the
bucentaur
rowed
out
of
the
channel
of
the
arsenal
and
came
sweeping
to
her
station
at
the
quay
of
mark
these
preliminaries
which
occupied
some
hours
being
observed
the
and
others
employed
about
the
person
of
the
head
of
the
republic
were
seen
opening
an
avenue
through
the
throng
after
which
the
rich
strains
of
a
hundred
instruments
proclaimed
the
approach
of
the
doge
we
shall
not
detain
the
narrative
to
describe
the
pomp
in
which
a
luxurious
and
affluent
aristocracy
that
in
general
held
itself
aloof
from
familiar
intercourse
with
those
it
ruled
displayed
its
magnificence
to
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
on
an
occasion
of
popular
rejoicing
long
lines
of
senators
dressed
in
their
robes
of
office
and
attended
by
crowds
of
liveried
followers
came
from
under
the
galleries
of
the
palace
and
descended
by
the
giant
stairway
into
the
sombre
court
thence
the
whole
issued
into
the
piazzetta
in
order
and
proceeded
to
their
several
stations
on
the
canopied
deck
of
the
well
known
bark
each
patrician
had
his
allotted
place
and
before
the
rear
of
the
cortège
had
yet
quitted
the
quay
there
was
a
long
and
imposing
row
of
grave
legislators
seated
in
the
established
order
of
their
precedency
the
ambassadors
the
high
dignitaries
of
the
state
and
the
aged
man
who
had
been
chosen
to
bear
the
empty
honors
of
sovereignty
still
remained
on
the
land
waiting
with
the
quiet
of
trained
docility
the
moment
to
embark
at
this
moment
a
man
of
an
embrowned
visage
legs
bare
to
the
knee
and
breast
open
to
the
breeze
rushed
through
the
guards
and
knelt
on
the
stones
of
the
quay
at
his
feet
justice
great
prince
cried
the
bold
stranger
justice
and
mercy
listen
to
one
who
has
bled
for
mark
and
who
hath
his
scars
for
his
witnesses
justice
and
mercy
are
not
always
companions
calmly
observed
he
who
wore
the
horned
bonnet
motioning
to
his
officious
attendants
to
let
the
intruder
stay
mighty
prince
i
come
for
the
last
who
and
what
art
thou
a
fisherman
of
the
lagunes
one
named
antonio
who
seeketh
the
liberty
of
the
prop
of
his
years
a
glorious
boy
that
force
and
the
policy
of
the
state
have
torn
from
me
this
should
not
be
violence
is
not
the
attribute
of
justice
but
the
youth
hath
offended
the
laws
and
he
suffereth
for
his
crimes
he
is
guilty
excellent
and
most
serene
highness
of
youth
and
health
and
strength
with
some
skill
in
the
craft
of
the
mariner
they
have
taken
him
without
warning
or
consent
for
the
service
of
the
galleys
and
have
left
me
in
my
age
alone
the
expression
of
pity
which
had
taken
possession
of
the
venerable
features
of
the
prince
changed
instantly
to
a
look
of
uneasiness
and
distrust
the
eye
which
just
before
had
melted
with
compassion
became
cold
and
set
in
its
meaning
and
signing
to
his
guards
he
bowed
with
dignity
to
the
attentive
and
curious
auditors
among
the
foreign
agents
to
proceed
bear
him
away
said
an
officer
who
took
his
master
meaning
from
the
glance
the
ceremonies
may
not
be
retarded
for
a
prayer
so
idle
antonio
offered
no
resistance
but
yielding
to
the
pressure
of
those
around
him
he
sank
back
meekly
among
the
crowd
disappointment
and
sorrow
giving
place
for
an
instant
to
an
awe
and
an
admiration
of
the
gorgeous
spectacle
that
were
perhaps
in
some
degree
inseparable
from
his
condition
and
habits
in
a
few
moments
the
slight
interruption
produced
by
this
short
scene
was
forgotten
in
the
higher
interest
of
the
occasion
when
the
ducal
party
had
taken
their
places
and
an
admiral
of
reputation
was
in
possession
of
the
helm
the
vast
and
gorgeous
bark
with
its
gilded
galleries
thronged
with
attendants
swept
away
from
the
quay
with
a
grand
and
stately
movement
its
departure
was
the
signal
for
a
new
burst
of
trumpets
and
clarions
and
for
fresh
acclamations
from
the
people
the
latter
rushed
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
by
the
time
the
bucentaur
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
port
the
stream
was
black
with
the
gondolas
that
followed
in
her
train
in
this
manner
did
the
gay
and
shouting
cortège
sweep
on
some
darting
ahead
of
the
principal
bark
and
some
clinging
like
smaller
fish
swimming
around
the
leviathan
as
near
to
her
sides
as
the
fall
of
the
ponderous
oars
would
allow
as
each
effort
of
the
crew
sent
the
galley
further
from
the
land
the
living
train
seemed
to
extend
itself
by
some
secret
principle
of
expansion
nor
was
the
chain
of
its
apparent
connexion
entirely
broken
until
the
bucentaur
had
passed
the
island
long
famous
for
its
convent
of
religious
arminians
here
the
movement
became
slower
in
order
to
permit
the
thousand
gondolas
to
approach
and
then
the
whole
moved
forward
in
nearly
one
solid
phalanx
to
the
landing
of
the
lido
the
marriage
of
the
adriatic
as
the
ceremony
was
quaintly
termed
has
been
too
often
described
to
need
a
repetition
here
our
business
is
rather
with
incidents
of
a
private
and
personal
nature
than
with
descriptions
of
public
events
and
we
shall
pass
over
all
that
has
no
immediate
connexion
with
the
interest
of
the
tale
when
the
bucentaur
became
stationary
a
space
around
her
stern
was
cleared
and
the
doge
appeared
in
a
rich
gallery
so
constructed
as
to
exhibit
the
action
to
all
in
sight
he
held
a
ring
glittering
with
precious
stones
on
high
and
pronouncing
the
words
of
betrothal
he
dropped
it
upon
the
bosom
of
his
fancied
spouse
shouts
arose
trumpets
blew
their
blasts
and
each
lady
waved
her
handkerchief
in
felicitation
of
the
happy
union
in
the
midst
of
the
fracas
which
was
greatly
heightened
by
the
roar
of
cannon
on
board
the
cruisers
in
the
channel
and
from
the
guns
in
the
arsenal
a
boat
glided
into
the
open
space
beneath
the
gallery
of
the
bucentaur
the
movement
of
the
arm
which
directed
the
light
gondola
was
dexterous
and
still
strong
though
the
hairs
of
him
who
held
the
oar
were
thin
and
white
a
suppliant
eye
was
cast
up
at
the
happy
faces
that
adorned
the
state
of
the
prince
and
then
the
look
was
changed
intently
to
the
water
a
small
buoy
fell
from
the
boat
which
glided
away
so
soon
that
amid
the
animation
and
uproar
of
that
moment
the
action
was
scarce
heeded
by
the
excited
throng
the
aquatic
procession
now
returned
towards
the
city
the
multitude
rending
the
air
with
shouts
at
the
happy
termination
of
a
ceremony
to
which
time
and
the
sanction
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
had
given
a
species
of
sanctity
that
was
somewhat
increased
by
superstition
it
is
true
that
a
few
among
the
venetians
themselves
regarded
these
famous
nuptials
of
the
adriatic
with
indifference
and
that
several
of
the
ministers
of
the
northern
and
more
maritime
states
who
were
witnesses
on
the
occasion
had
scarcely
concealed
as
they
cast
glances
of
intelligence
and
pride
among
themselves
their
smiles
still
such
was
the
influence
of
habit
for
so
much
does
even
arrogant
assumption
when
long
and
perseveringly
maintained
count
among
men
that
neither
the
increasing
feebleness
of
the
republic
nor
the
known
superiority
of
other
powers
on
the
very
element
which
this
pageant
was
intended
to
represent
as
the
peculiar
property
of
mark
could
yet
cover
the
lofty
pretension
with
the
ridicule
it
merited
time
has
since
taught
the
world
that
venice
continued
this
idle
deception
for
ages
after
both
reason
and
modesty
should
have
dictated
its
discontinuance
but
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
that
ambitious
crapulous
and
factitious
state
was
rather
beginning
to
feel
the
symptomatic
evidence
of
its
fading
circumstances
than
to
be
fully
conscious
of
the
swift
progress
of
a
downward
course
in
this
manner
do
communities
like
individuals
draw
near
their
dissolution
inattentive
to
the
symptoms
of
decay
until
they
are
overtaken
with
that
fate
which
finally
overwhelms
empires
and
their
power
in
the
common
lot
of
man
the
bucentaur
did
not
return
directly
to
the
quay
to
disburden
itself
of
its
grave
and
dignified
load
the
gaudy
galley
anchored
in
the
centre
of
the
port
and
opposite
to
the
wide
mouth
of
the
great
canal
officers
had
been
busy
throughout
the
morning
in
causing
all
the
shipping
and
heavy
boats
of
which
hundreds
lay
in
that
principal
artery
of
the
city
to
remove
from
the
centre
of
the
passage
and
heralds
now
summoned
the
citizens
to
witness
the
regatta
with
which
the
public
ceremonies
of
the
day
were
to
terminate
venice
from
her
peculiar
formation
and
the
vast
number
of
her
watermen
had
long
been
celebrated
for
this
species
of
amusement
families
were
known
and
celebrated
in
her
traditions
for
dexterous
skill
with
the
oar
as
they
were
known
in
rome
for
feats
of
a
far
less
useful
and
of
a
more
barbarous
nature
it
was
usual
to
select
from
these
races
of
watermen
the
most
vigorous
and
skilful
and
after
invoking
the
aid
of
and
arousing
their
pride
and
recollections
by
songs
that
recounted
the
feats
of
their
ancestors
to
start
them
for
the
goal
with
every
incitement
that
pride
and
the
love
of
victory
could
awaken
most
of
these
ancient
usages
were
still
observed
as
soon
as
the
bucentaur
was
in
its
station
some
thirty
or
forty
gondoliers
were
brought
forth
clad
in
their
gayest
habiliments
and
surrounded
and
supported
by
crowds
of
anxious
friends
and
relatives
the
intended
competitors
were
expected
to
sustain
the
reputations
of
their
several
names
and
they
were
admonished
of
the
disgrace
of
defeat
they
were
cheered
by
the
men
and
stimulated
by
the
smiles
and
tears
of
the
other
sex
the
rewards
were
recalled
to
their
minds
they
were
fortified
by
prayers
to
the
saints
and
then
they
were
dismissed
amid
the
cries
and
the
wishes
of
the
multitude
to
seek
their
allotted
places
beneath
the
stern
of
the
galley
of
state
it
has
already
been
mentioned
in
these
pages
that
the
city
of
venice
is
divided
into
two
nearly
equal
parts
by
a
channel
much
broader
than
that
of
the
ordinary
passages
of
the
town
this
dividing
artery
from
its
superior
size
and
depth
and
its
greater
importance
is
called
the
grand
canal
its
course
is
not
unlike
that
of
an
undulating
line
which
greatly
increases
its
length
as
it
is
much
used
by
the
larger
boats
of
the
bay
being
in
fact
a
sort
of
secondary
port
and
its
width
is
so
considerable
it
has
throughout
the
whole
distance
but
one
bridge
the
celebrated
rialto
the
regatta
was
to
be
held
on
this
canal
which
offered
the
requisites
of
length
and
space
and
which
as
it
was
lined
with
most
of
the
palaces
of
the
principal
senators
afforded
all
the
facilities
necessary
for
viewing
the
struggle
in
passing
from
one
end
of
this
long
course
to
the
other
the
men
destined
for
the
race
were
not
permitted
to
make
any
exertion
their
eyes
roamed
over
the
gorgeous
hangings
which
as
is
still
wont
throughout
italy
on
all
days
of
festa
floated
from
every
window
and
on
groups
of
females
in
rich
attire
brilliant
with
the
peculiar
charms
of
the
famed
venetian
beauty
that
clustered
in
the
balconies
those
who
were
domestics
rose
and
answered
to
the
encouraging
signals
thrown
from
above
as
they
passed
the
palaces
of
their
masters
while
those
who
were
watermen
of
the
public
endeavored
to
gather
hope
among
the
sympathizing
faces
of
the
multitude
at
length
every
formality
had
been
duly
observed
and
the
competitors
assumed
their
places
the
gondolas
were
much
larger
than
those
commonly
used
and
each
was
manned
by
three
watermen
in
the
centre
directed
by
a
fourth
who
standing
on
the
little
deck
in
the
stern
steered
while
he
aided
to
impel
the
boat
there
were
light
low
staffs
in
the
bows
with
flags
that
bore
the
distinguishing
colors
of
several
noble
families
of
the
republic
or
which
had
such
other
simple
devices
as
had
been
suggested
by
the
fancies
of
those
to
whom
they
belonged
a
few
flourishes
of
the
oars
resembling
the
preparatory
movements
which
the
master
of
fence
makes
ere
he
begins
to
push
and
parry
were
given
a
whirling
of
the
boats
like
the
prancing
of
curbed
racers
succeeded
and
then
at
the
report
of
a
gun
the
whole
darted
away
as
if
the
gondolas
were
impelled
by
volition
the
start
was
followed
by
a
shout
which
passed
swiftly
along
the
canal
and
an
eager
agitation
of
heads
that
went
from
balcony
to
balcony
till
the
sympathetic
movement
was
communicated
to
the
grave
load
under
which
the
bucentaur
labored
for
a
few
minutes
the
difference
in
force
and
skill
was
not
very
obvious
each
gondola
glided
along
the
element
apparently
with
that
ease
with
which
a
swallow
skims
the
lake
and
with
no
visible
advantage
to
any
one
of
the
ten
then
as
more
art
in
him
who
steered
or
greater
powers
of
endurance
in
those
who
rowed
or
some
of
the
latent
properties
of
the
boat
itself
came
into
service
the
cluster
of
little
barks
which
had
come
off
like
a
flock
of
birds
taking
flight
together
in
alarm
began
to
open
till
they
formed
a
long
and
vacillating
line
in
the
centre
of
the
passage
the
whole
train
shot
beneath
the
bridge
so
near
each
other
as
to
render
it
still
doubtful
which
was
to
conquer
and
the
exciting
strife
came
more
in
view
of
the
principal
personages
of
the
city
but
here
those
radical
qualities
which
insure
success
in
efforts
of
this
nature
manifested
themselves
the
weaker
began
to
yield
the
train
to
lengthen
and
hopes
and
fears
to
increase
until
those
in
front
presented
the
exhilarating
spectacle
of
success
while
those
behind
offered
the
still
more
noble
sight
of
men
struggling
without
hope
gradually
the
distances
between
the
boats
increased
while
that
between
them
and
the
goal
grew
rapidly
less
until
three
of
those
in
advance
came
in
like
glancing
arrows
beneath
the
stern
of
the
bucentaur
with
scarce
a
length
between
them
the
prize
was
won
the
conquerors
were
rewarded
and
the
artillery
gave
forth
the
usual
signals
of
rejoicing
music
answered
to
the
roar
of
cannon
and
the
peals
of
bells
while
sympathy
with
success
that
predominant
and
so
often
dangerous
principle
of
our
nature
drew
shouts
even
from
the
disappointed
the
clamor
ceased
and
a
herald
proclaimed
aloud
the
commencement
of
a
new
and
different
struggle
the
last
and
what
might
be
termed
the
national
race
had
been
limited
by
an
ancient
usage
to
the
known
and
recognised
gondoliers
of
venice
the
prize
had
been
awarded
by
the
state
and
the
whole
affair
had
somewhat
of
an
official
and
political
character
it
was
now
announced
however
that
a
race
was
to
be
run
in
which
the
reward
was
open
to
all
competitors
without
question
as
to
their
origin
or
as
to
their
ordinary
occupations
an
oar
of
gold
to
which
was
attached
a
chain
of
the
same
precious
metal
was
exhibited
as
the
boon
of
the
doge
to
him
who
showed
most
dexterity
and
strength
in
this
new
struggle
while
a
similar
ornament
of
silver
was
to
be
the
portion
of
him
who
showed
the
dexterity
and
bottom
a
mimic
boat
of
less
precious
metal
was
the
third
prize
the
gondolas
were
to
be
the
usual
light
vehicles
of
the
canals
and
as
the
object
was
to
display
the
peculiar
skill
of
that
city
of
islands
but
one
oarsman
was
allowed
to
each
on
whom
would
necessarily
fall
the
whole
duty
of
guiding
while
he
impelled
his
little
bark
any
of
those
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
previous
trial
were
admitted
to
this
and
all
desirous
of
taking
part
in
the
new
struggle
were
commanded
to
come
beneath
the
stern
of
the
bucentaur
within
a
prescribed
number
of
minutes
that
note
might
be
had
of
their
wishes
as
notice
of
this
arrangement
had
been
previously
given
the
interval
between
the
two
races
was
not
long
the
first
who
came
out
of
the
crowd
of
boats
which
environed
the
vacant
place
that
had
been
left
for
the
competitors
was
a
gondolier
of
the
public
landing
well
known
for
his
skill
with
the
oar
and
his
song
on
the
canal
how
art
thou
called
and
in
whose
name
dost
thou
put
thy
chance
demanded
the
herald
of
this
aquatic
course
all
know
me
for
bartolomeo
one
who
lives
between
the
piazzetta
and
the
lido
and
like
a
loyal
venetian
i
trust
in
san
teodoro
thou
art
well
protected
take
thy
place
and
await
thy
fortune
the
conscious
waterman
swept
the
water
with
a
back
stroke
of
his
blade
and
the
light
gondola
whirled
away
into
the
centre
of
the
vacant
spot
like
a
swan
giving
a
sudden
glance
aside
and
who
art
thou
demanded
the
official
of
the
next
that
came
enrico
a
gondolier
of
fusina
i
come
to
try
my
oar
with
the
braggarts
of
the
canals
in
whom
is
thy
trust
sant
antonio
di
padua
thou
wilt
need
his
aid
though
we
commend
thy
spirit
enter
and
take
place
and
who
art
thou
he
continued
to
another
when
the
second
had
imitated
the
easy
skill
of
the
first
i
am
called
gino
of
calabria
a
gondolier
in
private
service
what
noble
retaineth
thee
the
illustrious
and
most
excellent
don
camillo
monforte

and
lord
of
sant
agata
in

and
of
right
a
senator
in
venice
thou
have
come
of
padua
friend
by
thy
knowledge
of
the
laws
dost
thou
trust
in
him
thou
servest
for
the
victory
there
was
a
movement
among
the
senators
at
the
answer
of
gino
and
the
varlet
thought
he
perceived
frowns
gathering
on
more
than
one
brow
he
looked
around
in
quest
of
him
whose
greatness
he
had
vaunted
as
if
he
sought
succor
wilt
thou
name
thy
support
in
this
great
trial
of
force
resumed
the
herald
my
master
uttered
the
terrified
gino
januarius
and
st
mark
thou
art
well
defended
should
the
two
latter
fail
thee
thou
mayest
surely
count
on
the
first
signor
monforte

an
illustrious
name
and
he
is
welcome
to
our
venetian
sports
observed
the
doge
slightly
bending
his
head
towards
the
young
calabrian
noble
who
stood
at
no
great
distance
in
a
gondola
of
state
regarding
the
scene
with
a
countenance
this
cautious
interruption
of
the
pleasantries
of
the
official
was
acknowledged
by
a
low
reverence
and
the
matter
proceeded
take
thy
station
gino
of
calabria
and
a
happy
fortune
be
thine
said
the
latter
then
turning
to
another
he
asked
in
surprise
why
art
thou
here
i
come
to
try
my
gondola
swiftness
thou
art
old
and
unequal
to
this
struggle
husband
thy
strength
for
daily
toil
an
ambition
hath
put
thee
on
this
useless
trial
the
new
aspirant
had
forced
a
common
fisherman
gondola
of
no
bad
shape
and
of
sufficient
lightness
but
which
bore
about
it
all
the
vulgar
signs
of
its
daily
uses
beneath
the
gallery
of
the
bucentaur
he
received
the
reproof
meekly
and
was
about
to
turn
his
boat
aside
though
with
a
sorrowing
and
mortified
eye
when
a
sign
from
the
doge
arrested
his
arm
question
him
as
of
wont
said
the
prince
how
art
thou
named
continued
the
reluctant
official
who
like
all
of
subordinate
condition
had
far
more
jealousy
of
the
dignity
of
the
sports
he
directed
than
his
superior
i
am
known
as
antonio

of
the
lagunes

this
levity
again
antonio
would
have
shrunk
from
the
ten
thousand
eyes
that
shone
upon
him
when
the
calm
voice
of
the
doge
once
more
came
to
his
aid
the
struggle
is
open
to
all
said
the
sovereign
still
i
would
advise
the
poor
and
aged
man
to
take
counsel
give
him
silver
for
want
urges
him
to
this
hopeless
trial
thou
hearest
alms
are
offered
thee
but
give
place
to
those
who
are
stronger
and
more
seemly
for
the
sport
i
will
obey
as
is
the
duty
of
one
born
and
accustomed
to
poverty
they
said
the
race
was
open
to
all
and
i
crave
the
pardon
of
the
nobles
since
i
meant
to
do
them
no
dishonor
justice
in
the
palace
and
justice
on
the
canals
hastily
observed
the
prince
if
he
will
continue
it
is
his
right
it
is
the
pride
of
mark
that
his
balances
are
held
with
an
even
hand
a
murmur
of
applause
succeeded
the
specious
sentiment
for
the
powerful
rarely
affect
the
noble
attribute
of
justice
however
limited
may
be
its
exercise
without
their
words
finding
an
echo
in
the
tongues
of
the
selfish
thou
hearest
his
highness
who
is
the
voice
of
a
mighty
state
says
thou
mayest
remain
though
thou
art
still
advised
to
withdraw
i
will
then
see
what
virtue
is
left
in
this
naked
arm
returned
antonio
casting
a
mournful
glance
and
one
that
was
not
entirely
free
from
the
latent
vanity
of
man
at
his
meagre
and
threadbare
attire
the
limb
hath
its
scars
but
the
infidels
may
have
spared
enough
for
the
little

ask
in

thy

it
your

pleasure
that
one
disguised
should

for
the

doubt
it
not
a

is
sacred
in
venice
it
is
the
glory
of
our
excellent
and
wise
laws
that
he
who
seeketh
to
dwell
within
the
privacy
of
his
own
thoughts
and
to
keep
aloof
from
curiosity
by
shadowing
his
features
rangeth
our
streets
and
canals
as
if
he
dwelt
in
the
security
of
his
own
abode
such
are
the
high
privileges
of
liberty
and
such
it
is
to
be
a
citizen
of
a
generous
a
magnanimous
and
a
free
state
a
thousand
bowed
in
approbation
of
the
sentiment
and
a
rumor
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
that
a
young
noble
was
about
to
try
his
strength
in
the
regatta
in
compliment
to
some
wayward
beauty
such
is
justice
exclaimed
the
herald
in
a
loud
voice
admiration
apparently
overcoming
respect
in
the
ardor
of
the
moment
happy
is
he
that
is
born
in
venice
and
envied
are
the
people
in
whose
councils
wisdom
and
mercy
preside
like
lovely
and
benignant
sisters
on
whom
dost
thou
rely
mine
own
arm
ha
this
is
impious
none
so
presuming
may
enter
into
these
privileged
sports
the
hurried
exclamation
of
the
herald
was
accompanied
by
a
general
stir
such
as
denotes
sudden
and
strong
emotion
in
a
multitude
the
children
of
the
republic
are
protected
by
an
even
hand
observed
the
venerable
prince
it
formeth
our
just
pride
and
blessed
mark
forbid
that
aught
resembling
should
be
uttered
but
it
is
truly
our
boast
that
we
know
no
difference
between
our
subjects
of
the
islands
or
those
of
the
dalmatian
coast
between
padua
or
candia
corfu
or
giorgio
still
it
is
not
permitted
for
any
to
refuse
the
intervention
of
the
saints
name
thy
patron
or
quit
the
place
continued
the
observant
herald
anew
the
stranger
paused
as
if
he
looked
into
his
mind
and
then
he
answered
san
giovanni
of
the
wilderness
thou
namest
one
of
blessed
memory
i
name
him
who
may
have
pity
on
me
in
this
living
desert
the
temper
of
thy
soul
is
best
known
to
thyself
but
this
reverend
rank
of
patricians
yonder
brilliant
show
of
beauty
and
that
goodly
multitude
may
claim
another
take
thy
place
while
the
herald
proceeded
to
take
the
names
of
three
or
four
more
applicants
all
gondoliers
in
private
service
a
murmur
ran
through
the
spectators
which
proved
how
much
their
interest
and
curiosity
had
been
awakened
by
the
replies
and
appearance
of
the
two
last
competitors
in
the
meantime
the
young
nobles
who
entertained
those
who
came
last
began
to
move
among
the
throng
of
boats
with
the
intention
of
making
such
manifestations
of
their
gallant
desires
and
personal
devotion
as
suited
the
customs
and
opinions
of
the
age
the
list
was
now
proclaimed
to
be
full
and
the
gondolas
were
towed
off
as
before
towards
the
starting
point
leaving
the
place
beneath
the
stern
of
the
bucentaur
vacant
the
scene
that
followed
consequently
passed
directly
before
the
eyes
of
those
grave
men
who
charged
themselves
with
most
of
the
private
interests
as
well
as
with
the
public
concerns
of
venice
there
were
many
unmasked
and
dames
whirling
about
in
their
boats
attended
by
cavaliers
in
rich
attire
and
here
and
there
appeared
a
pair
of
dark
lustrous
eyes
peeping
through
the
silk
of
a
visor
that
concealed
some
countenance
too
youthful
for
exposure
in
so
gay
a
scene
one
gondola
in
particular
was
remarked
for
the
singular
grace
and
beauty
of
the
form
it
held
qualities
which
made
themselves
apparent
even
through
the
of
the
simple
habiliments
she
wore
the
boat
the
servants
and
the
ladies
for
there
were
two
were
alike
distinguished
for
that
air
of
severe
but
finished
simplicity
which
oftener
denotes
the
presence
of
high
quality
and
true
taste
than
a
more
lavish
expenditure
of
vulgar
ornament
a
carmelite
whose
features
were
concealed
by
his
cowl
testified
that
their
condition
was
high
and
lent
a
dignity
to
their
presence
by
his
reverend
and
grave
protection
a
hundred
gondolas
approached
this
party
and
after
as
many
fruitless
efforts
to
penetrate
the
disguises
glided
away
while
whispers
and
interrogatories
passed
from
one
to
another
to
learn
the
name
and
station
of
the
youthful
beauty
at
length
a
gay
bark
with
watermen
in
gorgeous
liveries
and
in
whose
equipment
there
was
a
studied
display
of
magnificence
came
into
the
little
circle
that
curiosity
had
drawn
together
the
single
cavalier
who
occupied
the
seat
arose
for
few
gondolas
appeared
that
day
with
their
and
mysterious
pavilions
and
saluted
the
masked
females
with
the
ease
of
one
accustomed
to
all
presences
but
with
the
reserve
of
deep
respect
i
have
a
favorite
follower
in
this
race
he
said
gallantly
and
one
in
whose
skill
and
force
i
put
great
trust
until
now
i
have
uselessly
sought
a
lady
of
a
beauty
and
merit
so
rare
as
to
warrant
that
i
should
place
his
fortune
on
her
smiles
but
i
seek
no
further
you
are
gifted
with
a
keen
sight
signore
that
you
discover
all
you
seek
beneath
these
masks
returned
one
of
the
two
females
while
their
companion
the
carmelite
bowed
graciously
to
the
compliment
which
seemed
little
more
than
was
warranted
by
the
usage
of
such
scenes
there
are
other
means
of
recognition
than
the
eyes
and
other
sources
of
admiration
than
the
senses
lady
conceal
yourselves
as
you
will
here
do
i
know
that
i
am
near
the
fairest
face
the
warmest
heart
and
the
purest
mind
of
venice
this
is
bold
augury
signore
returned
she
who
was
evidently
the
oldest
of
the
two
glancing
a
look
at
her
companion
as
if
to
note
the
effect
of
this
gallant
speech
venice
has
a
name
for
the
beauty
of
its
dames
and
the
sun
of
italy
warms
many
a
generous
heart
better
that
such
noble
gifts
should
be
directed
to
the
worship
of
the
creator
than
of
the
creature
murmured
the
monk
some
there
are
holy
father
who
have
admiration
for
both
such
i
would
fain
hope
is
the
happy
lot
of
her
who
is
favored
with
the
spiritual
counsel
of
one
so
virtuous
and
wise
as
yourself
here
i
place
my
fortune
let
what
may
follow
and
here
would
i
gladly
place
a
heavier
stake
were
it
permitted
as
the
cavalier
spoke
he
tendered
to
the
silent
fair
a
bouquet
of
the
sweetest
and
most
fragrant
flowers
and
among
them
were
those
to
which
poets
and
custom
have
ascribed
the
emblematic
qualities
of
constancy
and
love
she
to
whom
this
offering
of
gallantry
was
made
hesitated
to
accept
it
it
much
exceeded
the
reserve
imposed
on
one
of
her
station
and
years
to
allow
of
such
homage
from
the
other
sex
though
the
occasion
was
generally
deemed
one
that
admitted
of
more
than
usual
gallantry
and
she
evidently
shrank
with
the
sensitiveness
of
one
whose
feelings
were
unpractised
from
a
homage
so
public
receive
the
flowers
my
love
mildly
whispered
her
companion
the
cavalier
who
offers
them
simply
intends
to
show
the
quality
of
his
breeding
that
will
be
seen
in
the
end
hastily
returned
don
camillo
for
it
was
he
signora
adieu
we
have
met
on
this
water
when
there
was
less
restraint
between
us
he
bowed
and
signing
to
his
gondolier
was
quickly
lost
in
the
crowd
of
boats
ere
the
barks
however
were
separated
the
mask
of
the
silent
fair
was
slightly
moved
as
if
she
sought
relief
from
the
air
and
the
neapolitan
was
rewarded
for
his
gallantry
by
a
momentary
glance
at
the
glowing
countenance
of
violetta
thy
guardian
hath
a
displeased
eye
hurriedly
observed
donna
florinda
i
wonder
that
we
should
be
known
i
should
more
wonder
that
we
were
not
i
could
recall
the
noble
neapolitan
cavalier
amid
a
million
thou
dost
not
remember
all
that
i
owe
to
him
donna
florinda
did
not
answer
but
in
secret
she
offered
up
a
fervent
prayer
that
the
obligation
might
be
blessed
to
the
future
happiness
of
her
who
had
received
it
there
was
a
furtive
and
uneasy
glance
between
her
and
the
carmelite
but
as
neither
spoke
a
long
and
thoughtful
silence
succeeded
the
rencontre
from
this
musing
the
party
in
common
with
all
the
gay
and
laughing
multitude
by
which
they
were
surrounded
were
reminded
of
the
business
on
which
they
were
assembled
by
the
the
agitation
on
the
great
canal
nearest
the
scene
of
strife
and
a
clear
blast
of
the
trumpets
but
in
order
that
the
narrative
may
proceed
regularly
it
is
fit
that
we
should
return
a
little
in
the
order
of
time
chapter
ix
here
art
thou
in
appointment
fresh
and
fair
anticipating
time
with
starting
courage
shakspeare
it
has
been
seen
that
the
gondolas
which
were
to
contend
in
the
race
had
been
towed
towards
the
place
of
starting
in
order
that
the
men
might
enter
on
the
struggle
with
undiminished
vigor
in
this
precaution
even
the
humble
and
fisherman
had
not
been
neglected
but
his
boat
like
the
others
was
attached
to
the
larger
barges
to
which
this
duty
had
been
assigned
still
as
he
passed
along
the
canal
before
the
crowded
balconies
and
groaning
vessels
which
lined
its
sides
there
arose
that
scornful
and
deriding
laugh
which
seems
ever
to
grow
more
strong
and
bold
as
misfortune
weighs
most
heavily
on
its
subject
the
old
man
was
not
unconscious
of
the
remarks
of
which
he
was
the
subject
and
as
it
is
rare
indeed
that
our
sensibilities
do
not
survive
our
better
fortunes
even
he
was
so
far
conscious
of
a
fall
as
not
to
be
callous
to
contempt
thus
openly
expressed
he
looked
wistfully
on
every
side
of
him
and
seemed
to
seek
in
every
eye
he
encountered
some
portion
of
the
sympathy
which
his
meek
and
humble
feelings
still
craved
but
even
the
men
of
his
caste
and
profession
threw
jibes
upon
his
ear
and
though
of
all
the
competitors
perhaps
the
one
whose
motive
most
hallowed
his
ambition
he
was
held
to
be
the
only
proper
subject
of
mirth
for
the
solution
of
this
revolting
trait
of
human
character
we
are
not
to
look
to
venice
and
her
institutions
since
it
is
known
that
none
are
so
arrogant
on
occasions
as
the
ridden
and
that
the
abject
and
insolent
spirits
are
usually
tenants
of
the
same
bosom
the
movement
of
the
boats
brought
those
of
the
masked
waterman
and
the
subjects
of
those
taunts
side
by
side
thou
art
not
the
favorite
in
this
strife
observed
the
former
when
a
fresh
burst
of
jibes
was
showered
on
the
head
of
his
unresisting
associate
thou
hast
not
been
sufficiently
heedful
of
thy
attire
for
this
is
a
town
of
luxury
and
he
who
would
meet
applause
must
appear
on
the
canals
in
the
guise
of
one
less
borne
upon
by
fortune
i
know
them
i
know
them
returned
the
fisherman
they
are
led
away
by
their
pride
and
they
think
ill
of
one
who
can
not
share
in
their
vanities
but
friend
unknown
i
have
brought
with
me
a
face
which
old
though
it
be
and
wrinkled
and
worn
by
the
weather
like
the
stones
of
the
is
uncovered
to
the
eye
and
without
shame
there
may
be
reasons
which
thou
knowest
not
why
i
wear
a
mask
but
if
my
face
be
hid
the
limbs
are
bare
and
thou
seest
there
is
no
lack
of
sinews
to
make
good
that
which
i
have
undertaken
thou
have
thought
better
of
the
matter
ere
thou
puttest
thyself
in
the
way
of
so
much
mortification
defeat
will
not
cause
the
people
to
treat
thee
more
tenderly
if
my
sinews
are
old
and
stiffened
signor
mask
they
are
long
used
to
toil
as
to
shame
if
it
is
a
shame
to
be
below
the
rest
of
mankind
in
fortune
it
will
not
now
come
for
the
first
time
a
heavy
sorrow
hath
befallen
me
and
this
race
may
lighten
the
burden
of
grief
i
shall
not
pretend
that
i
hear
this
laughter
and
all
these
scornful
speeches
as
one
listens
to
the
evening
breeze
on
the
lagunes
for
a
man
is
still
a
man
though
he
lives
with
the
humblest
and
eats
of
the
coarsest
but
let
it
pass
sant
antonio
will
give
me
heart
to
bear
it
thou
hast
a
stout
mind
fisherman
and
i
would
gladly
pray
my
patron
to
grant
thee
a
stronger
arm
but
that
i
have
much
need
of
this
victory
myself
wilt
thou
be
content
with
the
second
prize
if
by
any
manner
of
skill
i
might
aid
thy
efforts
for
i
suppose
the
metal
of
the
third
is
as
little
to
thy
taste
as
it
is
to
my
own
nay
i
count
not
on
gold
or
silver
can
the
honor
of
such
a
struggle
awaken
the
pride
of
one
like
thee
the
old
man
looked
earnestly
at
his
companion
but
he
shook
his
head
without
answer
fresh
merriment
at
his
expense
caused
him
to
bend
his
face
towards
the
scoffers
and
he
perceived
they
were
just
then
passing
a
numerous
group
of
his
fellows
of
the
lagunes
who
seemed
to
feel
that
his
unjustifiable
ambition
reflected
in
some
degree
on
the
honor
of
their
whole
body
how
now
old
antonio
shouted
the
boldest
of
the
band
is
it
not
enough
that
thou
hast
won
the
honors
of
the
net
but
thou
have
a
golden
oar
at
thy
neck
we
shall
yet
see
him
of
the
senate
cried
a
second
he
standeth
in
need
of
the
horned
bonnet
for
his
naked
head
continued
a
third
we
shall
see
the
brave
admiral
antonio
sailing
in
the
bucentaur
with
the
nobles
of
the
land
their
sallies
were
succeeded
by
coarse
laughter
even
the
fair
in
the
balconies
were
not
uninfluenced
by
these
constant
jibes
and
the
apparent
discrepancy
between
the
condition
and
the
means
of
so
unusual
a
pretender
to
the
honors
of
the
regatta
the
purpose
of
the
old
man
wavered
but
he
seemed
goaded
by
some
inward
incentive
that
still
enabled
him
to
maintain
his
ground
his
companion
closely
watched
the
varying
expression
of
a
countenance
that
was
far
too
little
trained
in
deception
to
conceal
the
feelings
within
and
as
they
approached
the
place
of
starting
he
again
spoke
thou
mayest
yet
withdraw
he
said
why
should
one
of
thy
years
make
the
little
time
he
has
to
stay
bitter
by
bearing
the
ridicule
of
his
associates
for
the
rest
of
his
life
anthony
did
a
greater
wonder
when
he
caused
the
fishes
to
come
up
on
the
waters
to
hear
his
preaching
and
i
will
not
show
a
cowardly
heart
at
a
moment
when
there
is
most
need
of
resolution
the
masked
waterman
crossed
himself
devoutly
and
relinquishing
all
further
design
to
persuade
the
other
to
abandon
the
fruitless
contest
he
gave
all
his
thoughts
to
his
own
interest
in
the
coming
struggle
the
narrowness
of
most
of
the
canals
of
venice
with
the
innumerable
angles
and
the
constant
passing
have
given
rise
to
a
fashion
of
construction
and
of
rowing
that
are
so
peculiar
to
that
city
and
its
immediate
dependencies
as
to
require
some
explanation
the
reader
has
doubtless
already
understood
that
a
gondola
is
a
long
narrow
and
light
boat
adapted
to
the
uses
of
the
place
and
distinct
from
the
wherries
of
all
other
towns
the
distance
between
the
dwellings
on
most
of
the
canals
is
so
small
that
the
width
of
the
latter
does
not
admit
of
the
use
of
oars
on
both
sides
at
the
same
time
the
necessity
of
constantly
turning
aside
to
give
room
for
others
and
the
frequency
of
the
bridges
and
the
corners
have
suggested
the
expediency
of
placing
the
face
of
the
waterman
in
the
direction
in
which
the
boat
is
steering
and
of
course
of
keeping
him
on
his
feet
as
every
gondola
when
fully
equipped
has
its
pavilion
in
the
centre
the
height
of
the
latter
renders
it
necessary
to
place
him
who
steers
on
such
an
elevation
as
will
enable
him
to
overlook
it
from
these
several
causes
a
boat
in
venice
is
propelled
by
a
gondolier
who
stands
on
a
little
angular
deck
in
its
stern
formed
like
the
low
roof
of
a
house
and
the
stroke
of
the
oar
is
given
by
a
push
instead
of
a
pull
as
is
common
elsewhere
this
habit
of
rowing
erect
however
which
is
usually
done
by
a
forward
instead
of
a
backward
movement
of
the
body
is
not
unfrequent
in
all
the
ports
of
the
mediterranean
though
in
no
other
is
there
a
boat
which
resembles
the
gondola
in
all
its
properties
or
uses
the
upright
position
of
the
gondolier
requires
that
the
pivot
on
which
the
oar
rests
should
have
a
corresponding
elevation
and
there
is
consequently
a
species
of
bumkin
raised
from
the
side
of
the
boat
to
the
desired
height
and
which
being
formed
of
a
crooked
and
very
irregular
knee
of
wood
has
two
or
three
one
above
the
other
to
suit
the
stature
of
different
individuals
or
to
give
a
broader
or
a
narrower
sweep
of
the
blade
as
the
movement
shall
require
as
there
is
frequent
occasion
to
cast
the
oar
from
one
of
these
to
the
other
and
not
unfrequently
to
change
its
side
it
rests
in
a
very
open
bed
and
the
instrument
is
kept
in
its
place
by
great
dexterity
alone
and
by
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
means
of
accommodating
the
force
and
the
rapidity
of
the
effort
to
the
forward
movement
of
the
boat
and
the
resistance
of
the
water
all
these
difficulties
united
render
skill
in
a
gondolier
one
of
the
most
delicate
branches
of
a
waterman
art
as
it
is
clear
that
muscular
strength
alone
though
of
great
aid
can
avail
but
little
in
such
a
practice
the
great
canal
of
venice
following
its
windings
being
more
than
a
league
in
length
the
distance
in
the
present
race
was
reduced
nearly
half
by
causing
the
boats
to
start
from
the
rialto
at
this
point
then
the
gondolas
were
all
assembled
attended
by
those
who
were
to
place
them
as
the
whole
of
the
population
which
before
had
been
extended
along
the
entire
course
of
the
water
was
now
crowded
between
the
bridge
and
the
bucentaur
the
long
and
graceful
avenue
resembled
a
vista
of
human
heads
it
was
an
imposing
sight
to
look
along
that
bright
and
living
lane
and
the
hearts
of
each
competitor
beat
high
as
hope
or
pride
or
apprehension
became
the
feeling
of
the
moment
gino
of
calabria
cried
the
marshal
who
placed
the
gondolas
thy
station
is
on
the
right
take
it
and
januarius
speed
thee
the
servitor
of
don
camillo
assumed
his
oar
and
the
boat
glided
gracefully
into
its
berth

ever

he
then
summoned
in
succession
those
whose
names
have
not
been
mentioned
and
placed
them
side
by
side
in
the
centre
of
the
canal
here
is
place
for
thee
signore
continued
the
officer
inclining
his
head
to
the
unknown
gondolier
for
he
had
imbibed
the
general
impression
that
the
face
of
some
young
patrician
was
concealed
beneath
the
mask
to
humor
the
fancy
of
some
capricious
chance
hath
given
thee
the
extreme
left
thou
hast
forgotten
to
call
the

the
masker
as
he
drove
his
own
gondola
into
its
station

the
hoary
fool
persist
in
exposing
his
vanity
and
his
rags
to
the
best
of
venice
i
can
take

the
rear
meekly
observed
antonio
there
may
be
those

it
doth
not

like
me
to
crowd
and
a
few
strokes
of
the
oar
more
or
less
can
differ
but
little
in
so
long
a
strife
thou
hadst
better
push
modesty
to
discretion
and
remain
if
it

pleasure

i
would
rather
see
what
anthony
may
do
for
an
old
fisherman

has

sixty
years
it
is

as
thou
seemest
content
with
it
keep
the
place
thou
hast

it

a
little

appeal
to
your

there
is
to
be
no

or
other
foul
expedients

except
ready
oars
and
nimble

he
who
varies
needlessly
from
his
line
until
he
leadeth
shall
be
recalled
by
name
and
whoever
is
guilty
of
any
act
to
spoil
the
sports
or
otherwise
to
offend
the
patricians
shall
be
both
checked
and
punished
be
ready
for
the
signal
the
assistant
who
was
in
a
strongly
manned
boat
fell
back
a
little
while
runners
similarly
equipped
went
ahead
to
order
the
curious
from
the
water
these
preparations
were
scarcely
made
when
a
signal
floated
on
the
nearest
dome
it
was
repeated
on
the
campanile
and
a
gun
was
fired
at
the
arsenal
a
deep
but
suppressed
murmur
arose
in
the
throng
which
was
as
quickly
succeeded
by
suspense
each
gondolier
had
suffered
the
bows
of
his
boat
to
incline
slightly
towards
the
left
shore
of
the
canal
as
the
jockey
is
seen
at
the
to
turn
his
courser
aside
in
order
to
repress
its
ardor
or
divert
its
attention
but
the
first
long
and
broad
sweep
of
the
oar
brought
them
all
in
a
line
again
and
away
they
glided
in
a
body
for
the
first
few
minutes
there
was
no
difference
in
speed
nor
any
sign
by
which
the
instructed
might
detect
the
probable
evidence
of
defeat
or
success
the
whole
ten
which
formed
the
front
line
skimmed
the
water
with
an
equal
velocity
beak
to
beak
as
if
some
secret
attraction
held
each
in
its
place
while
the
humble
though
equally
light
bark
of
the
fisherman
steadily
kept
its
position
in
the
rear
the
boats
were
soon
held
in
command
the
oars
got
their
justest
poise
and
widest
sweep
and
the
wrists
of
the
men
accustomed
to
their
play
the
line
began
to
waver
it
undulated
the
glittering
prow
of
one
protruding
beyond
the
others
and
then
it
changed
its
form
enrico
of
fusina
shot
ahead
and
privileged
by
success
he
insensibly
sheered
more
into
the
centre
of
the
canal
avoiding
by
the
change
the
eddies
and
the
other
obstructions
of
the
shore
this
manoeuvre
which
in
the
language
of
the
course
would
have
been
called
taking
the
track
had
the
additional
advantage
of
throwing
upon
those
who
followed
some
trifling
impediment
from
the
the
sturdy
and
practised
bartolomeo
of
the
lido
as
his
companions
usually
called
him
came
next
occupying
the
space
on
his
leader
quarter
where
he
suffered
least
from
the
reaction
caused
by
the
stroke
of
his
oar
the
gondolier
of
don
camillo
also
soon
shot
out
of
the
crowd
and
was
seen
plying
his
arms
vigorously
still
farther
to
the
right
and
a
little
in
the
rear
of
bartolomeo
then
came
in
the
centre
of
the
canal
and
near
as
might
be
in
the
rear
of
the
triumphant
waterman
of
the
main
a
dense
body
with
little
order
and
varying
positions
compelling
each
other
to
give
way
and
otherwise
increasing
the
difficulties
of
their
struggle
more
to
the
left
and
so
near
to
the
palaces
as
barely
to
allow
room
for
the
sweep
of
his
oar
was
the
masked
competitor
whose
progress
seemed
retarded
by
some
unseen
cause
for
he
gradually
fell
behind
all
the
others
until
several
boats
lengths
of
open
water
lay
between
him
and
even
the
group
of
his
nameless
opponents
still
he
plied
his
arms
steadily
and
with
sufficient
skill
as
the
interest
of
mystery
had
been
excited
in
his
favor
a
rumor
passed
up
the
canal
that
the
young
cavalier
had
been
little
favored
by
fortune
in
the
choice
of
a
boat
others
who
reflected
more
deeply
on
causes
whispered
of
the
folly
of
one
of
his
habits
taking
the
risk
of
mortification
by
a
competition
with
men
whose
daily
labor
had
hardened
their
sinews
and
whose
practice
enabled
them
to
judge
closely
of
every
chance
of
the
race
but
when
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
turned
from
the
cluster
of
passing
boats
to
the
solitary
barge
of
the
fisherman
who
came
singly
on
in
the
rear
admiration
was
again
turned
to
derision
antonio
had
cast
aside
the
cap
he
wore
of
wont
and
the
few
straggling
hairs
that
were
left
streamed
about
his
hollow
temples
leaving
the
whole
of
his
swarthy
features
exposed
to
view
more
than
once
as
the
gondola
came
on
his
eyes
turned
aside
reproachfully
as
if
he
keenly
felt
the
stings
of
so
many
unlicensed
tongues
applied
to
feelings
which
though
blunted
by
his
habits
and
condition
were
far
from
extinguished
laugh
arose
above
laugh
however
and
taunt
succeeded
taunt
more
bitterly
as
the
boats
came
among
the
gorgeous
palaces
which
lined
the
canal
nearer
to
the
goal
it
was
not
that
the
owners
of
these
lordly
piles
indulged
in
the
unfeeling
triumph
but
their
dependants
constantly
subject
themselves
to
the
degrading
influence
of
a
superior
presence
let
loose
the
torrents
of
their
arrogance
on
the
head
of
the
first
unresisting
subject
which
offered
antonio
bore
all
these
jibes
manfully
if
not
in
tranquillity
and
always
without
retort
until
he
again
approached
the
spot
occupied
by
his
companions
of
the
lagunes
here
his
eye
sank
under
the
reproaches
and
his
oar
faltered
the
taunts
and
denunciations
increased
as
he
lost
ground
and
there
was
a
moment
when
the
rebuked
and
humbled
spirit
of
the
old
man
seemed
about
to
relinquish
the
contest
but
dashing
a
hand
across
his
brow
as
if
to
clear
a
sight
which
had
become
dimmed
and
confused
he
continued
to
ply
the
oar
and
happily
he
was
soon
past
the
point
most
trying
to
his
resolution
from
this
moment
the
cries
against
the
fisherman
diminished
and
as
the
bucentaur
though
still
distant
was
now
in
sight
interest
in
the
issue
of
the
race
absorbed
all
other
feelings
enrico
still
kept
the
lead
but
the
judges
of
the
gondolier
skill
began
to
detect
signs
of
exhaustion
in
his
faltering
stroke
the
waterman
of
the
lido
pressed
him
hard
and
the
calabrian
was
drawing
more
into
a
line
with
them
both
at
this
moment
too
the
masked
competitor
exhibited
a
force
and
skill
that
none
had
expected
to
see
in
one
of
his
supposed
rank
his
body
was
thrown
more
upon
the
effort
of
the
oar
and
as
his
leg
was
stretched
behind
to
aid
the
stroke
it
discovered
a
volume
of
muscle
and
an
excellence
of
proportion
that
excited
murmurs
of
applause
the
consequence
was
soon
apparent
his
gondola
glided
past
the
crowd
in
the
centre
of
the
canal
and
by
a
change
that
was
nearly
insensible
he
became
the
fourth
in
the
race
the
shouts
which
rewarded
his
success
had
scarcely
parted
from
the
multitude
ere
their
admiration
was
called
to
a
new
and
an
entirely
unexpected
aspect
in
the
struggle
left
to
his
own
exertions
and
less
annoyed
by
that
derision
and
contempt
which
often
defeat
even
more
generous
efforts
antonio
had
drawn
nearer
to
the
crowd
of
nameless
competitors
though
undistinguished
in
this
narrative
there
were
seen
in
that
group
of
gondoliers
faces
well
known
on
the
canals
of
venice
as
belonging
to
watermen
in
whose
dexterity
and
force
the
city
took
pride
either
favored
by
his
isolated
position
or
availing
himself
of
the
embarrassment
these
men
gave
to
each
other
the
despised
fisherman
was
seen
a
little
on
their
left
coining
up
abreast
with
a
stroke
and
velocity
that
promised
further
success
the
expectation
was
quickly
realized
he
passed
them
all
amid
a
dead
and
wondering
silence
and
took
his
station
as
fifth
in
the
struggle
from
this
moment
all
interest
in
those
who
formed
the
vulgar
mass
was
lost
every
eye
was
turned
towards
the
front
where
the
strife
increased
at
each
stroke
of
the
oar
and
where
the
issue
began
to
assume
a
new
and
doubtful
character
the
exertions
of
the
waterman
of
fusina
were
seemingly
redoubled
though
his
boat
went
no
faster
the
gondola
of
bartolomeo
shot
past
him
it
was
followed
by
those
of
gino
and
the
masked
gondolier
while
not
a
cry
betrayed
the
breathless
interest
of
the
multitude
but
when
the
boat
of
antonio
also
swept
ahead
there
arose
such
a
hum
of
voices
as
escapes
a
throng
when
a
sudden
and
violent
change
of
feeling
is
produced
in
their
wayward
sentiments
enrico
was
frantic
with
the
disgrace
he
urged
every
power
of
his
frame
to
avert
the
dishonor
with
the
desperate
energy
of
an
italian
and
then
he
cast
himself
into
the
bottom
of
the
gondola
tearing
his
hair
and
weeping
in
agony
his
example
was
followed
by
those
in
the
rear
though
with
more
governed
feelings
for
they
shot
aside
among
the
boats
which
lined
the
canal
and
were
lost
to
view
from
this
open
and
unexpected
abandonment
of
the
struggle
the
spectators
got
the
surest
evidence
of
its
desperate
character
but
as
a
man
has
little
sympathy
for
the
unfortunate
when
his
feelings
are
excited
by
competition
the
defeated
were
quickly
forgotten
the
name
of
bartolomeo
was
borne
high
upon
the
winds
by
a
thousand
voices
and
his
fellows
of
the
piazzetta
and
the
lido
called
upon
him
aloud
to
die
for
the
honor
of
their
craft
well
did
the
sturdy
gondolier
answer
to
their
wishes
for
palace
after
palace
was
left
behind
and
no
further
change
was
made
in
the
relative
positions
of
the
boats
but
like
his
predecessor
the
leader
redoubled
his
efforts
with
a
diminished
effect
and
venice
had
the
mortification
of
seeing
a
stranger
leading
one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
her
regattas
bartolomeo
no
sooner
lost
place
than
gino
the
masker
and
the
despised
antonio
in
turn
shot
by
leaving
him
who
had
so
lately
been
first
in
the
race
the
last
he
did
not
however
relinquish
the
strife
but
continued
to
struggle
with
the
energy
of
one
who
merited
a
better
fortune
when
this
unexpected
and
entirely
new
character
was
given
to
the
contest
there
still
remained
a
broad
sheet
of
water
between
the
advancing
gondolas
and
the
goal
gino
led
and
with
many
favorable
symptoms
of
his
being
able
to
maintain
his
advantage
he
was
encouraged
by
the
shouts
of
the
multitude
who
now
forgot
his
calabrian
origin
in
his
success
while
many
of
the
of
his
master
cheered
him
on
by
name
all
would
not
do
the
masked
waterman
for
the
first
time
threw
the
grandeur
of
his
skill
and
force
into
the
oar
the
ashen
instrument
bent
to
the
power
of
an
arm
whose
strength
appeared
to
increase
at
will
and
the
movements
of
his
body
became
rapid
as
the
leaps
of
the
greyhound
the
pliant
gondola
obeyed
and
amid
a
shout
which
passed
from
the
piazzetta
to
the
rialto
it
glided
ahead
if
success
gives
force
and
increases
the
physical
and
moral
energies
there
is
a
fearful
and
certain
reaction
in
defeat
the
follower
of
don
camillo
was
no
exception
to
the
general
law
and
when
the
masked
competitor
passed
him
the
boat
of
antonio
followed
as
if
it
were
impelled
by
the
same
strokes
the
distance
between
the
two
leading
gondolas
even
now
seemed
to
lessen
and
there
was
a
moment
of
breathless
interest
when
all
there
expected
to
see
the
fisherman
in
despite
of
his
years
and
boat
shooting
past
his
rival
but
expectation
was
deceived
he
of
the
mask
notwithstanding
his
previous
efforts
seemed
to
sport
with
the
toil
so
ready
was
the
sweep
of
his
oar
so
sure
its
stroke
and
so
vigorous
the
arm
by
which
it
was
impelled
nor
was
antonio
an
antagonist
to
despise
if
there
was
less
of
the
grace
of
a
practised
gondolier
of
the
canals
in
his
attitudes
than
in
those
of
his
companion
there
was
no
relaxation
in
the
force
of
his
sinews
they
sustained
him
to
the
last
with
that
enduring
power
which
had
been
begotten
by
threescore
years
of
unremitting
labor
and
while
his
still
athletic
form
was
exerted
to
the
utmost
there
appeared
no
failing
of
its
energies
a
few
moments
sent
the
leading
gondolas
several
lengths
ahead
of
their
nearest
followers
the
dark
beak
of
the
fisherman
boat
hung
upon
the
quarter
of
the
more
showy
bark
of
his
antagonist
but
it
could
do
no
more
the
port
was
open
before
them
and
they
glanced
by
church
palace
barge
mystick
and
felucca
without
the
slightest
inequality
in
their
relative
speed
the
masked
waterman
glanced
a
look
behind
as
if
to
calculate
his
advantage
and
then
bending
again
to
his
pliant
oar
he
spoke
loud
enough
to
be
heard
only
by
him
who
pressed
so
hard
upon
his
track
thou
hast
deceived
me
fisherman
he
said
there
is
more
of
manhood
in
thee
yet
than
i
had
thought
if
there
is
manhood
in
my
arms
there
is
childlessness
and
sorrow
at
the
heart
was
the
reply
dost
thou
so
prize
a
golden
bauble
thou
art
second
be
content
with
thy
lot
it
will
not
do
i
must
be
foremost
or
i
have
wearied
my
old
limbs
in
vain
this
brief
dialogue
was
uttered
with
an
ease
that
showed
how
far
use
had
accustomed
both
to
powerful
bodily
efforts
and
with
a
firmness
of
tones
that
few
could
have
equalled
in
a
moment
of
so
great
physical
effort
the
masker
was
silent
but
his
purpose
seemed
to
waver
twenty
strokes
of
his
powerful
and
the
goal
was
attained
but
his
sinews
were
not
so
much
extended
and
that
limb
which
had
shown
so
fine
a
development
of
muscle
was
less
swollen
and
rigid
the
gondola
of
old
antonio
glided
abeam
push
thy
soul
into
the
blade
muttered
he
of
the
mask
or
thou
wilt
yet
be
beaten
the
fisherman
threw
every
effort
of
his
body
on
the
coming
effort
and
he
gained
a
fathom
another
stroke
caused
the
boat
to
quiver
to
its
centre
and
the
water
curled
from
its
bows
like
the
ripple
of
a
rapid
then
the
gondola
darted
between
the
two
and
the
little
flags
that
marked
the
point
of
victory
fell
into
the
water
the
action
was
scarce
noted
ere
the
glittering
beak
of
the
masquer
shot
past
the
eyes
of
the
judges
who
doubted
for
an
instant
on
whom
success
had
fallen
gino
was
not
long
behind
and
after
him
came
bartolomeo
fourth
and
last
in
the
best
contested
race
which
had
ever
been
seen
on
the
waters
of
venice
when
the
flags
fell
men
held
their
breaths
in
suspense
few
knew
the
victor
so
close
had
been
the
struggle
but
a
flourish
of
the
trumpets
soon
commanded
attention
and
then
a
herald
proclaimed
that
antonio
a
fisherman
of
the
lagunes
favored
by
his
holy
patron
of
the
miraculous
draught
had
borne
away
the
prize
of
gold
while
a
waterman
who
wore
his
face
concealed
but
who
hath
trusted
to
the
care
of
the
blessed
san
giovanni
of
the
wilderness
is
worthy
of
the
silver
prize
and
that
the
third
had
fallen
to
the
fortunes
of
gino
of
calabria
a
servitor
of
the
illustrious
don
camillo
monforte
duca
di
sant
agata
and
lord
of
many
neapolitan
seignories
when
this
formal
announcement
was
made
there
succeeded
a
silence
like
that
of
the
tomb
then
there
arose
a
general
shout
among
the
living
mass
which
bore
on
high
the
name
of
antonio
as
if
they
celebrated
the
success
of
some
conqueror
all
feeling
of
contempt
was
lost
in
the
influence
of
his
triumph
the
fishermen
of
the
lagunes
who
so
lately
had
loaded
their
aged
companion
with
contumely
shouted
for
his
glory
with
a
zeal
that
manifested
the
violence
of
the
transition
from
mortification
to
pride
and
as
has
ever
been
and
ever
will
be
the
meed
of
success
he
who
was
thought
least
likely
to
obtain
it
was
most
greeted
with
praise
and
adulation
when
it
was
found
that
the
end
had
disappointed
expectation
ten
thousand
voices
were
lifted
in
proclaiming
his
skill
and
victory
and
young
and
old
the
fair
the
gay
the
noble
the
winner
of
sequins
and
he
who
lost
struggled
alike
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
humble
old
man
who
had
so
unexpectedly
wrought
this
change
of
sentiment
in
the
feelings
of
a
multitude
antonio
bore
his
triumph
meekly
when
his
gondola
had
reached
the
goal
he
checked
its
course
and
without
discovering
any
of
the
usual
signs
of
exhaustion
he
remained
standing
though
the
deep
heaving
of
his
broad
and
tawny
chest
proved
that
his
powers
had
been
taxed
to
their
utmost
he
smiled
as
the
shouts
arose
on
his
ear
for
praise
is
grateful
even
to
the
meek
still
he
seemed
oppressed
with
an
emotion
of
a
character
deeper
than
pride
age
had
somewhat
dimmed
his
eye
but
it
was
now
full
of
hope
his
features
worked
and
a
single
burning
drop
fell
on
each
rugged
cheek
the
fisherman
then
breathed
more
freely
like
his
successful
antagonist
the
waterman
of
the
mask
betrayed
none
of
the
debility
which
usually
succeeds
great
bodily
exertion
his
knees
were
motionless
his
hands
still
grasped
the
oar
firmly
and
he
too
kept
his
feet
with
a
steadiness
that
showed
the
physical
perfection
of
his
frame
on
the
other
hand
both
gino
and
bartolomeo
sank
in
their
respective
boats
as
they
gained
the
goal
in
succession
and
so
exhausted
was
each
of
these
renowned
gondoliers
that
several
moments
elapsed
before
either
had
breath
for
speech
it
was
during
this
momentary
pause
that
the
multitude
proclaimed
its
sympathy
with
the
victor
by
their
longest
and
loudest
shouts
the
noise
had
scarcely
died
away
however
before
a
herald
summoned
antonio
of
the
lagunes
the
masked
waterman
of
the
blessed
john
of
the
wilderness
and
gino
the
calabrian
to
the
presence
of
the
doge
whose
princely
hand
was
to
bestow
the
promised
prizes
of
the
regatta

shall
not

large

with
you
macbeth
when
the
three
gondolas
reached
the
side
of
the
bucentaur
the
fisherman
hung
back
as
if
he
distrusted
his
right
to
intrude
himself
into
the
presence
of
the
senate
he
was
however
commanded
to
ascend
and
signs
were
made
for
his
two
companions
to
follow
the
nobles
clad
in
their
attire
of
office
formed
a
long
and
imposing
lane
from
the
gangway
to
the
stern
where
the
titular
sovereign
of
that
still
more
titular
republic
was
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
high
officers
of

and

and
natural

said
the
prince
mildly
observing
that
the
old
and
man
that
led
the
victors
hesitated
to
advance
thou
art
the
conqueror
fisherman
and
to
thy
hands
must
i
consign
the
prize
antonio
bent
his
knee
to
the
deck
and
bowed
his
head
lowly
ere
he
obeyed
then
taking
courage
he
drew
nearer
to
the
person
of
the
doge
where
he
stood
with
a
bewildered
eye
and
rebuked
mien
waiting
the
further
pleasure
of
his
superiors
the
aged
prince
paused
for
stillness
to
succeed
the
slight
movements
created
by
curiosity
when
he
spoke
it
was
amid
a
perfect
calm
it
is
the
boast
of
our
glorious
republic
he
said
that
the
rights
of
none
are
disregarded
that
the
lowly
receive
their
merited
rewards
as
surely
as
the
great
that
mark
holds
the
balance
with
an
even
hand
and
that
this
obscure
fisherman
having
deserved
the
honors
of
this
regatta
will
receive
them
with
the
same
readiness
on
the
part
of
him
who
bestows
as
if
he
were
the
most
favored
follower
of
our
own
house
nobles
and
burghers
of
venice
learn
to
prize
your
excellent
and
equable
laws
in
this
occasion
for
it
is
most
in
acts
of
familiar
and
common
usage
that
the
paternal
character
of
a
government
is
seen
since
in
matters
of
higher
moment
the
eyes
of
a
world
impel
a
compliance
with
its
own
opinions
the
doge
delivered
these
preliminary
remarks
in
a
firm
tone
like
one
confident
of
his
auditors
applause
he
was
not
deceived
no
sooner
had
he
done
than
a
murmur
of
approbation
passed
through
the
assembly
and
extended
itself
to
thousands
who
were
beyond
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
to
more
who
were
beyond
the
reach
of
his
meaning
the
senators
bent
their
heads
in
acknowledgment
of
the
justice
of
what
their
chief
had
uttered
and
the
latter
having
waited
to
gather
these
signs
of
an
approving
loyalty
proceeded
it
is
my
duty
antonio
and
being
a
duty
it
hath
become
a
pleasure
to
place
around
thy
neck
this
golden
chain
the
oar
which
it
bears
is
an
emblem
of
thy
skill
and
among
thy
associates
it
will
be
a
mark
of
the
republic
favor
and
impartiality
and
of
thy
merit
take
it
then
vigorous
old
man
for
though
age
hath
thinned
thy
temples
and
furrowed
thy
cheek
it
hath
scarcely
affected
thy
wonderful
sinews
and
hardy
courage
highness
observed
antonio
recoiling
apace
when
he
found
that
he
was
expected
to
stoop
in
order
that
the
bauble
might
be
bestowed
i
am
not
fit
to
bear
about
me
such
a
sign
of
greatness
and
good
fortune
the
glitter
of
the
gold
would
mock
my
poverty
and
a
jewel
which
comes
from
so
princely
a
hand
would
be
ill
placed
on
a
naked
bosom
this
unexpected
refusal
caused
a
general
surprise
and
a
momentary
pause
thou
hast
not
entered
on
the
struggle
fisherman
without
a
view
to
its
prize
but
thou
sayest
truly
the
golden
ornament
would
indeed
but
ill
befit
thy
condition
and
daily
wants
wear
it
for
the
moment
since
it
is
meet
that
all
should
know
the
justice
and
impartiality
of
our
decisions
and
bring
it
to
my
treasurer
when
the
sports
are
done
he
will
make
such
an
exchange
as
better
suits
thy
wishes
there
is
precedent
for
this
practice
and
it
shall
be
followed
illustrious
highness
i
did
not
trust
my
old
limbs
in
so
hard
a
strife
without
hopes
of
a
reward
but
it
was
not
gold
nor
any
vanity
to
be
seen
among
my
equals
with
that
glittering
jewel
that
led
me
to
meet
the
scorn
of
the
gondoliers
and
the
displeasure
of
the
great
thou
art
deceived
honest
fisherman
if
thou
supposest
that
we
regard
thy
just
ambition
with
displeasure
we
love
to
see
a
generous
emulation
among
our
people
and
take
all
proper
means
to
encourage
those
aspiring
spirits
who
bring
honor
to
a
state
and
fortune
to
our
shores
i
pretend
not
to
place
my
poor
thoughts
against
those
of
my
prince
answered
the
fisherman
my
fears
and
shame
have
led
me
to
believe
that
it
would
give
more
pleasure
to
the
noble
and
gay
had
a
younger
and
happier
borne
away
this
honor
thou
must
not
think
this
bend
then
thy
knee
that
i
may
bestow
the
prize
when
the
sun
sets
thou
wilt
find
those
in
my
palace
who
will
relieve
thee
of
the
ornament
at
a
just
remuneration
highness
said
antonio
looking
earnestly
at
the
doge
who
again
arrested
his
movement
in
surprise
i
am
old
and
little
wont
to
be
spoilt
by
fortune
for
my
wants
the
lagunes
with
the
favor
of
the
holy
anthony
are
sufficient
but
it
is
in
thy
power
to
make
the
last
days
of
an
old
man
happy
and
to
have
thy
name
remembered
in
many
an
honest
and
well
meant
prayer
grant
me
back
my
child
forget
the
boldness
of
a
father
is
not
this
he
who
urged
us
with
importunity
concerning
a
youth
that
is
gone
into
the
service
of
the
state
exclaimed
the
prince
across
whose
countenance
passed
that
expression
of
habitual
reserve
which
so
often
concealed
the
feelings
of
the
man
the
same
returned
a
cold
voice
which
the

of

well

did
not
waver
he
kneeled
with
an
air
of
profound
respect
and
folding
his
hands
on
his
bosom
he
said
misery
has
made
me
bold
dread
prince
what
i
say
comes
from
a
heavy
heart
rather
than
from
a
licentious
tongue
and
i
pray
your
royal
ear
to
listen
with
indulgence
speak
briefly
for
the
sports
are
delayed
mighty
doge
riches
and
poverty
have
caused
a
difference
in
our
fortunes
which
knowledge
and
ignorance
have
made
wider
i
am
rude
in
my
discourse
and
little
suited
to
this
illustrious
company
but
signore
god
hath
given
to
the
fisherman
the
same
feelings
and
the
same
love
for
his
offspring
as
he
has
given
to
a
prince
did
i
place
dependence
only
on
the
aid
of
my
poor
learning
i
should
now
be
dumb
but
there
is
a
strength
within
that
gives
me
courage
to
speak
to
the
first
and
noblest
in
venice
in
behalf
of
my
child
thou
canst
not
impeach
the
senate
justice
old
man
or
utter
aught
in
truth
against
the
known
impartiality
of
the
laws
sovrano
mio
deign
to
listen
and
you
shall
hear
i
am
what
your
eyes
behold
a
man
poor
laborious
and
drawing
near
to
the
hour
when
he
shall
be
called
to
the
side
of
the
blessed
anthony
of
rimini
and
stand
in
a
presence
even
greater
than
this
i
am
not
vain
enough
to
think
that
my
humble
name
is
to
be
found
among
those
of
the
patricians
who
have
served
the
republic
in
her
wars
that
is
an
honor
which
none
but
the
great
and
the
noble
and
the
happy
can
claim
but
if
the
little
i
have
done
for
my
country
is
not
in
the
golden
book
it
is
written
here
as
antonio
spoke
he
pointed
to
the
scars
on
his
form
these
are
signs
of
the
enmity
of
the
turk
and
i
now
offer
them
as
so
many
petitions
to
the
bounty
of
the
senate
thou
speakest
vaguely
what
is
thy
will
justice
mighty
prince
they
have
forced
the
only
vigorous
branch
from
the
dying
trunk
they
have
lopped
the
withering
stem
of
its
most
promising
shoot
they
have
exposed
the
sole
companion
of
my
labors
and
pleasures
the
child
to
whom
i
have
looked
to
close
my
eyes
when
it
shall
please
god
to
call
me
away
untaught
and
young
in
lessons
of
honesty
and
virtue
a
boy
in
principle
as
in
years
to
all
the
temptation
and
sin
and
dangerous
companionship
of
the
galleys
is
this
all
i
had
thought
thy
gondola
in
the
decay
or
thy
right
to
use
the
lagunes
in
question
is
this
all
repeated
antonio
looking
around
him
in
bitter
melancholy
doge
of
venice
it
is
more
than
one
old
and
bereaved
can
bear
go
to
take
thy
golden
chain
and
oar
and
depart
among
thy
fellows
in
triumph
gladden
thy
heart
at
a
victory
on
which
thou
not
in
reason
have
counted
and
leave
the
interests
of
the
state
to
those
that
are
wiser
than
thee
and
more
fitted
to
sustain
its
cares
the
fisherman
arose
with
an
air
of
rebuked
submission
the
result
of
a
long
life
passed
in
the
habit
of
political
deference
but
he
did
not
approach
to
receive
the
proffered
reward
bend
thy
head
fisherman
that
his
highness
may
bestow
the
prize
commanded
an
officer
i
ask
not
for
gold
nor
any
oar
but
that
which
carries
me
to
the
lagunes
in
the
morning
and
brings
me
back
into
the
canals
at
night
give
me
my
child
or
give
me
nothing
away
with
him
muttered
a
dozen
voices
he
utters
sedition
let
him
quit
the
galley
antonio
was
hurried
from
the
presence
and
forced
into
his
gondola
with
very
unequivocal
signs
of
disgrace
this
unwonted
interruption
of
the
ceremonies
clouded
many
a
brow
for
the
sensibilities
of
a
venetian
noble
were
quick
indeed
to
reprehend
the
immorality
of
political
discontent
though
the
conventional
dignity
of
the
class
suppressed
all
other
exhibition
of
dissatisfaction
let
the
next
competitor
draw
near
continued
the
sovereign
with
a
composure
that
constant
practice
in
dissimulation
rendered
easy
the
unknown
waterman
to
whose
secret
favor
antonio
owed
his
success
approached
still
concealed
by
the
licensed
mask
thou
art
the
gainer
of
the
second
prize
said
the
prince
and
were
rigid
justice
done
thou
receive
the
first
also
since
our
favor
is
not
to
be
rejected
with
impunity
kneel
that
i
may
bestow
the
favor
highness
pardon
observed
the
masker
bowing
with
great
respect
but
withdrawing
a
single
step
from
the
offered
reward
if
it
be
your
gracious
will
to
grant
a
boon
for
the
success
of
the
regatta
i
too
have
to
pray
that
it
may
be
given
in
another
form
this
is
unusual
it
is
not
wont
that
prizes
offered
by
the
hand
of
a
venetian
doge
should
go
i
would
not
seem
to
press
more
than
is
respectful
in
this
great
presence
i
ask
but
little
and
in
the
end
it
may
cost
the
republic
less
than
that
which
is
now
offered
name
it
i
too
and
on
my
knee
in
dutiful
homage
to
the
chief
of
the
state
beg
that
the
prayer
of
the
old
fisherman
be
heard
and
that
the
father
and
son
may
be
restored
to
each
other
for
the
service
will
corrupt
the
tender
years
of
the
boy
and
make
the
age
of
his
parent
miserable
this
touches
on
importunity
who
art
thou
that
comest
in
this
hidden
manner
to
support
a
petition
once
refused
highness
the
second
victor
in
the
ducal
regatta
dost
trifle
in
thy
answers
the
protection
of
a
mask
in
all
that
does
not
tend
to
unsettle
the
peace
of
the
city
is
sacred
but
here
seemeth
matter
to
be
looked
into
remove
thy
disguise
that
we
see
thee
eye
to
eye
i
have
heard
that
he
who
kept
civil
speech
and
in
naught
offended
against
the
laws
might
be
seen
at
will
disguised
in
venice
without
question
of
his
affairs
or
name
most
true
in
all
that
does
not
offend
mark
but
here
is
a
concert
worthy
of
inquiry
i
command
thee
unmask
the
waterman
reading
in
every
face
around
him
the
necessity
of
obedience
slowly
withdrew
the
means
of
concealment
and
discovered
the
pallid
countenance
and
glittering
eyes
of
jacopo
an
involuntary
movement
of
all
near
left
this
dreaded
person
standing
singly
confronted
with
the
prince
of
venice
in
a
wide
circle
of
wondering
and
curious
listeners
i
know
thee
not
exclaimed
the
doge
with
an
open
amazement
that
proved
his
sincerity
after
regarding
the
other
earnestly
for
a
moment
thy
reasons
for
the
disguise
should
be
better
than
thy
reasons
for
refusing
the
prize
the
signor
gradenigo
drew
near
to
the
sovereign
and
whispered
in
his
ear
when
he
had
done
the
latter
cast
one
look
in
which
curiosity
and
aversion
were
in
singular
union
at
the
marked
countenance
of
the
bravo
and
then
he
silently
motioned
to
him
to
depart
the
throng
drew
about
the
royal
person
with
instinctive
readiness
closing
the
space
in
his
front
we
shall
look
into
this
at
our
leisure
said
the
doge
let
the
festivities
proceed
jacopo
bowed
low
and
withdrew
as
he
moved
along
the
deck
of
the
bucentaur
the
senators
made
way
as
if
pestilence
was
in
his
path
though
it
was
quite
apparent
by
the
expression
of
their
faces
that
it
was
in
obedience
to
a
feeling
of
a
mixed
character
the
avoided
but
still
tolerated
bravo
descended
to
his
gondola
and
the
usual
signals
were
given
to
the
multitude
beneath
who
believed
the
customary
ceremonies
were
ended
let
the
gondolier
of
don
camillo
monforte
stand
forth
cried
a
herald
obedient
to
the
beck
of
a
superior
highness
here
answered
gino
troubled
and
hurried
thou
art
of
calabria
highness
yes
but
of
long
practice
on
our
venetian
canals
or
thy
gondola
could
never
have
outstripped
those
of
the
readiest
oarsmen
thou
servest
a
noble
master
highness
yes
and
it
would
seem
that
the
duke
of
agata
is
happy
in
the
possession
of
an
honest
and
faithful
follower
highness
too
happy
kneel
and
receive
the
reward
of
thy
resolution
and
skill
gino
unlike
those
who
had
preceded
him
bent
a
willing
knee
to
the
deck
and
took
the
prize
with
a
low
and
humble
inclination
of
the
body
at
this
moment
the
attention
of
the
spectators
was
drawn
from
the
short
and
simple
ceremony
by
a
loud
shout
which
arose
from
the
water
at
no
great
distance
from
the
privileged
bark
of
the
senate
a
common
movement
drew
all
to
the
side
of
the
galley
and
the
successful
gondolier
was
quickly
forgotten
a
hundred
boats
were
moving
in
a
body
towards
the
lido
while
the
space
they
covered
on
the
water
presented
one
compact
mass
of
the
red
caps
of
fishermen
in
the
midst
of
this
marine
picture
was
seen
the
bare
head
of
antonio
borne
along
in
the
floating
multitude
without
any
effort
of
his
own
the
general
impulsion
was
received
from
the
vigorous
arms
of
some
thirty
or
forty
of
their
number
who
towed
those
in
the
rear
by
applying
their
force
to
three
or
four
large
gondolas
in
advance
there
was
no
mistaking
the
object
of
this
singular
and
characteristic
procession
the
tenants
of
the
lagunes
with
the
fickleness
with
which
extreme
ignorance
acts
on
human
passions
had
suddenly
experienced
a
violent
revolution
in
their
feelings
towards
their
ancient
comrade
he
who
an
hour
before
had
been
derided
as
a
vain
and
ridiculous
pretender
and
on
whose
head
bitter
imprecations
had
been
so
lavishly
poured
was
now
lauded
with
cries
of
triumph
the
gondoliers
of
the
canals
were
laughed
to
scorn
and
the
ears
of
even
the
haughty
nobles
were
not
respected
as
the
exulting
band
taunted
their
pampered
menials
in
short
by
a
process
which
is
common
enough
with
man
in
all
the
divisions
and
subdivisions
of
society
the
merit
of
one
was
at
once
intimately
and
inseparably
connected
with
the
glory
and
exultation
of
all
had
the
triumph
of
the
fishermen
confined
itself
to
this
natural
and
commonplace
exhibition
it
would
not
have
given
grave
offence
to
the
vigilant
and
jealous
power
that
watched
over
the
peace
of
venice
but
amid
the
shouts
of
approbation
were
mingled
cries
of
censure
words
of
grave
import
were
even
heard
denouncing
those
who
refused
to
restore
to
antonio
his
child
and
it
was
whispered
on
the
deck
of
the
bucentaur
that
filled
with
the
imaginary
importance
of
their
passing
victory
the
hardy
band
of
rioters
had
dared
to
menace
a
forcible
appeal
to
obtain
what
they
audaciously
termed
the
justice
of
the
case
this
ebullition
of
popular
feeling
was
witnessed
by
the
assembled
senate
in
ominous
and
brooding
silence
one
unaccustomed
to
reflection
on
such
a
subject
or
unpractised
in
the
world
might
have
fancied
alarm
and
uneasiness
were
painted
on
the
grave
countenances
of
the
patricians
and
that
the
signs
of
the
times
were
little
favorable
to
the
continuance
of
an
ascendency
that
was
dependent
more
on
the
force
of
convention
than
on
the
possession
of
any
physical
superiority
but
on
the
other
hand
one
who
was
capable
of
judging
between
the
power
of
political
ascendency
strengthened
by
its
combinations
and
order
and
the
mere
ebullitions
of
passion
however
loud
and
clamorous
might
readily
have
seen
that
the
latter
was
not
yet
displayed
in
sufficient
energy
to
break
down
the
barriers
which
the
first
had
erected
the
fishermen
were
permitted
to
go
their
way
unmolested
though
here
and
there
a
gondola
was
seen
stealing
towards
the
lido
bearing
certain
of
those
secret
agents
of
the
police
whose
duty
it
was
to
forewarn
the
existing
powers
of
the
presence
of
danger
among
the
latter
was
the
boat
of
the
which
departed
from
the
piazzetta
containing
a
stock
of
his
merchandise
with
annina
under
the
pretence
of
making
his
profit
out
of
the
present
turbulent
temper
of
their
ordinary
customers
in
the
meantime
the
sports
proceeded
and
the
momentary
interruption
was
forgotten
or
if
remembered
it
was
in
a
manner
suited
to
the
secret
and
fearful
power
which
directed
the
destinies
of
that
remarkable
republic
there
as
another
regatta
in
which
men
of
inferior
powers
contended
but
we
deem
it
unworthy
to
detain
the
narrative
by
a
description
though
the
grave
tenants
of
the
bucentaur
seemed
to
take
an
interest
in
what
was
passing
immediately
before
their
eyes
they
had
ears
for
every
shout
that
was
borne
on
the
evening
breeze
from
the
distant
lido
and
more
than
once
the
doge
himself
was
seen
to
bend
his
looks
in
that
direction
in
a
manner
which
betrayed
the
concern
that
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
still
the
day
passed
on
as
usual
the
conquerors
triumphed
the
crowd
applauded
and
the
collected
senate
appeared
to
sympathize
with
the
pleasures
of
a
people
over
whom
they
ruled
with
a
certainty
of
power
that
resembled
the
fearful
and
mysterious
march
of
destiny
chapter
xi
which

the

here
and
which
the
jew
shakspeare
the
evening
of
such
a
day
in
a
city
with
the
habits
of
venice
was
not
likely
to
be
spent
in
the
dulness
of
retirement
the
great
square
of
mark
was
again
filled
with
its
active
and
motley
crowd
and
the
scenes
already
described
in
the
opening
chapters
of
this
work
were
resumed
if
possible
with
more
apparent
devotion
to
the
levities
of
the
hour
than
on
the
occasion
mentioned
the
tumblers
and
jugglers
renewed
their
antics
the
cries
of
the
and
other
venders
of
light
luxuries
were
again
mingled
with
the
tones
of
the
flute
and
the
notes
of
the
guitar
and
harp
while
the
idle
and
the
busy
the
thoughtless
and
the
designing
the
conspirator
and
the
agent
of
the
police
once
more
met
in
privileged
security
the
night
had
advanced
beyond
its
turn
when
a
gondola
came
gliding
through
the
shipping
of
the
port
with
that
easy
and
motion
which
is
peculiar
to
its
slow
movement
and
touched
the
quay
with
its
beak
at
the
point
where
the
canal
of
mark
forms
its
junction
with
the
bay
thou
art
welcome
antonio
said
one
who
approached
the
solitary
individual
that
had
directed
the
gondola
when
the
latter
had
thrust
the
iron
spike
of
his
painter
between
the
crevices
of
the
stones
as
gondoliers
are
accustomed
to
secure
their
barges
thou
art
welcome
antonio
though
late
i
begin
to
know
the
sounds
of
that
voice
though
they
come
from
a
masked
face
said
the
fisherman
friend
i
owe
my
success
to
thy
kindness
and
though
it
has
not
had
the
end
for
which
i
had
both
hoped
and
prayed
i
ought
not
to
thank
thee
less
thou
hast
thyself
been
borne
hard
upon
by
the
world
or
thou
not
have
bethought
thee
of
an
old
and
despised
man
when
the
shouts
of
triumph
were
ringing
in
thy
ear
and
when
thy
own
young
blood
was
stirred
with
the
feelings
of
pride
and
victory
nature
gives
thee
strong
language
fisherman
i
have
not
passed
the
hours
truly
in
the
games
and
levities
of
my
years
life
has
been
no
festa
to
me
but
no
matter
the
senate
was
not
pleased
to
hear
of
lessening
the
number
of
the
galleys
crew
and
thou
wilt
bethink
thee
of
some
other
reward
i
have
here
the
chain
and
golden
oar
in
the
hope
that
it
will
still
be
welcome
antonio
looked
amazed
but
yielding
to
a
natural
curiosity
he
gazed
a
moment
with
a
longing
at
the
prize
then
recoiling
with
a
shudder
he
uttered
moodily
and
with
the
tones
of
one
whose
determination
was
made
i
should
think
the
bauble
coined
of
my
grandchild
blood
keep
it
they
have
trusted
it
to
thee
for
it
is
thine
of
right
and
now
that
they
refuse
to
hear
my
prayer
it
will
be
useless
to
all
but
to
him
who
fairly
earned
it
thou
makest
no
allowance
fisherman
for
difference
of
years
and
for
sinews
that
are
in
their
vigor
methinks
that
in
adjudging
such
a
prize
thought
should
be
had
to
these
matters
and
then
wouldest
thou
be
found
outstripping
us
all
holy
theodore
i
passed
my
childhood
with
the
oar
in
hand
and
never
before
have
i
met
one
in
venice
who
has
driven
my
gondola
so
hard
thou
touchest
the
water
with
the
delicacy
of
a
lady
fingering
her
harp
and
yet
with
the
force
of
the
wave
rolling
on
the
lido
i
have
seen
the
hour
jacopo
when
even
thy
young
arm
would
have
tired
in
such
a
strife
between
us
that
was
before
the
birth
of
my
eldest
son
who
died
in
battle
with
the
ottoman
when
the
dear
boy
he
left
me
was
but
an
infant
in
arms
thou
never
sawest
the
comely
lad
good
jacopo
i
was
not
so
happy
old
man
but
if
he
resembled
thee
well
mayest
thou
mourn
his
loss
body
of
diana
i
have
little
cause
to
boast
of
the
small
advantage
youth
and
strength
gave
me
there
was
a
force
within
that
bore
me
and
the
boat
on
but
of
what
use
hath
it
been
thy
kindness
and
the
pain
given
to
an
old
frame
that
hath
been
long
racked
by
hardship
and
poverty
are
both
thrown
away
on
the
rocky
hearts
of
the
nobles
we
know
not
yet
antonio
the
good
saints
will
hear
our
prayers
when
we
least
think
they
are
listening
come
with
me
for
i
am
sent
to
seek
thee
the
fisherman
regarded
his
new
acquaintance
with
surprise
and
then
turning
to
bestow
an
instant
of
habitual
care
on
his
boat
he
cheerfully
professed
himself
ready
to
proceed
the
place
where
they
stood
was
a
little
apart
from
the
thoroughfare
of
the
quays
and
though
there
was
a
brilliant
moon
the
circumstance
of
two
men
in
their
garbs
being
there
was
not
likely
to
attract
observation
but
jacopo
did
not
appear
to
be
satisfied
with
this
security
from
remark
he
waited
until
antonio
had
left
the
gondola
and
then
unfolding
a
cloak
which
had
lain
on
his
arm
he
threw
it
without
asking
permission
over
the
shoulders
of
the
other
a
cap
like
that
he
wore
himself
was
next
produced
and
being
placed
on
the
grey
hairs
of
the
fisherman
effectually
completed
his
metamorphosis
there
is
no
need
of
a
mask
he
said
examining
his
companion
attentively
when
his
task
was
accomplished
none
would
know
thee
antonio
in
this
garb
and
is
there
need
of
what
thou
hast
done
jacopo
i
owe
thee
thanks
for
a
well
meant
and
but
for
the
hardness
of
heart
of
the
rich
and
powerful
for
what
would
have
proved
a
great
kindness
still
i
must
tell
thee
that
a
mask
was
never
yet
put
before
my
face
for
what
reason
can
there
be
why
one
who
rises
with
the
sun
to
go
to
his
toil
who
trusteth
to
the
favor
of
the
blessed
anthony
for
the
little
he
hath
should
go
abroad
like
a
gallant
ready
to
steal
the
good
name
of
a
virgin
or
a
robber
at
night
thou
knowest
our
venetian
custom
and
it
may
be
well
to
use
some
caution
in
the
business
we
are
on
thou
forgettest
that
thy
intention
is
yet
a
secret
to
me
i
say
it
again
and
i
say
it
with
truth
and
gratitude
that
i
owe
thee
many
thanks
though
the
end
is
defeated
and
the
boy
is
still
a
prisoner
in
the
of
wickedness
but
thou
hast
a
name
jacopo
that
i
could
wish
did
not
belong
to
thee
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
all
that
they
have
this
day
said
on
the
lido
of
one
who
has
so
much
feeling
for
the
weak
and
wronged
the
bravo
ceased
to
adjust
the
disguise
of
his
companion
and
the
profound
stillness
which
succeeded
his
remark
proved
so
painful
to
antonio
that
he
felt
like
one
reprieved
from
suffocation
when
he
heard
the
deep
respiration
that
announced
the
relief
of
his
companion
i
would
not
willingly
say
no
matter
interrupted
jacopo
in
a
hollow
voice
no
matter
fisherman
we
will
speak
of
these
things
on
some
other
occasion
at
present
follow
and
be
silent
as
he
ceased
the
guide
of
antonio
beckoned
for
the
latter
to
come
on
when
he
led
the
way
from
the
water
side
the
fisherman
obeyed
for
little
did
it
matter
to
one
poor
and
as
he
whither
he
was
conducted
jacopo
took
the
first
entrance
into
the
court
of
the
doge
palace
his
footstep
was
leisurely
and
to
the
passing
multitude
they
appeared
like
any
others
of
the
thousands
who
were
abroad
to
breathe
the
soft
air
of
the
night
or
to
enter
into
the
pleasures
of
the
piazza
when
within
the
dimmer
and
broken
light
of
the
court
jacopo
paused
evidently
to
scan
the
persons
of
those
it
contained
it
is
to
be
presumed
he
saw
no
reason
to
delay
for
with
a
secret
sign
to
his
companion
to
follow
he
crossed
the
area
and
mounted
the
well
known
steps
down
which
the
head
of
the
faliero
had
rolled
and
which
from
the
statues
on
the
summit
is
called
the
giant
stairs
the
celebrated
mouths
of
the
lions
were
passed
and
they
were
walking
swiftly
along
the
open
gallery
when
they
encountered
a
halberdier
of
the
ducal
guard
who
comes
demanded
the
mercenary
throwing
forward
his
long
and
dangerous
weapon
friends
to
the
state
and
to
st
mark
none
pass
at
this
hour
without
the
word
jacopo
motioned
to
antonio
to
stand
fast
while
he
drew
nearer
to
the
halberdier
and
whispered
the
weapon
was
instantly
thrown
up
and
the
sentinel
again
paced
the
long
gallery
with
practised
indifference
the
way
was
no
sooner
cleared
than
they
proceeded
antonio
not
a
little
amazed
at
what
he
had
already
seen
eagerly
followed
his
guide
for
his
heart
began
to
beat
high
with
an
exciting
but
undefined
hope
he
was
not
so
ignorant
of
human
affairs
as
to
require
to
be
told
that
those
who
ruled
would
sometimes
concede
that
in
secret
which
policy
forbade
them
to
yield
openly
full
therefore
of
the
expectation
of
being
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
doge
himself
and
of
having
his
child
restored
to
his
arms
the
old
man
stepped
lightly
along
the
gloomy
gallery
and
darting
through
an
entrance
at
the
heels
of
jacopo
he
found
himself
at
the
foot
of
another
flight
of
massive
steps
the
route
now
became
confused
to
the
fisherman
for
quitting
the
more
public
vomitories
of
the
palace
his
companion
held
his
way
by
a
secret
door
through
many
dimly
lighted
and
obscure
passages
they
ascended
and
descended
frequently
as
often
quitting
or
entering
rooms
of
but
ordinary
dimensions
and
decorations
until
the
head
of
antonio
was
completely
turned
and
he
no
longer
knew
the
general
direction
of
their
course
at
length
they
stopped
in
an
apartment
of
inferior
ornaments
and
of
a
dusky
color
which
the
feeble
light
rendered
still
more
gloomy
thou
art
well
acquainted
with
the
dwelling
of
our
prince
said
the
fisherman
when
his
companion
enabled
him
to
speak
by
checking
his
swift
movements
the
oldest
gondolier
of
venice
is
not
more
ready
on
the
canals
than
thou
appearest
to
be
among
these
galleries
and
corridors
is
my
business
to
bring
thee
hither
and
what
i
am
to
do
i
endeavor
to
do
well
antonio
thou
art
a
man
that
feareth
not
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
the
great
as
this
day
hath
shown
summon
thy
courage
for
a
moment
of
trial
is
before
thee
i
have
spoken
boldly
to
the
doge
except
the
holy
father
himself
what
power
is
there
on
earth
besides
to
fear
thou
mayest
have
spoken
fisherman
too
boldly
temper
thy
language
for
the
great
love
not
words
of
disrespect
is
truth
unpleasant
to
them
that
is
as
may
be
they
love
to
hear
their
own
acts
praised
when
their
acts
have
merited
praise
but
they
do
not
like
to
hear
them
condemned
even
though
they
know
what
is
said
to
be
just
i
fear
me
said
the
old
man
looking
with
simplicity
at
the
other
there
is
little
difference
between
the
powerful
and
the
weak
when
the
garments
are
stripped
from
both
and
the
man
stands
naked
to
the
eye
that
truth
may
not
be
spoken
here
how
do
they
deny
that
they
are
christians
and
mortals
and
sinners
they
make
a
merit
of
the
first
antonio
they
forget
the
second
and
they
never
like
to
be
called
the
last
by
any
but
themselves
i
doubt
jacopo
after
all
if
i
get
from
them
the
freedom
of
the
boy
speak
them
fair
and
say
naught
to
wound
their
or
to
menace
their
authority
they
will
pardon
much
if
the
last
in
particular
be
respected
but
it
is
that
authority
which
has
taken
away
my
child
can
i
speak
in
favor
of
the
power
which
i
know
to
be
unjust
thou
must
feign
it
or
thy
suit
will
fail
i
will
go
back
to
the
lagunes
good
jacopo
for
this
tongue
of
mine
hath
ever
moved
at
the
bidding
of
the
heart
i
fear
i
am
too
old
to
say
that
a
son
may
righteously
be
torn
from
the
father
by
violence
tell
them
thou
from
me
that
i
came
thus
far
in
order
to
do
them
respect
but
that
seeing
the
hopelessness
of
beseeching
further
i
have
gone
to
my
nets
and
to
my
prayers
to
blessed
st
anthony
as
he
ceased
speaking
antonio
wrung
the
hand
of
his
motionless
companion
and
turned
away
as
if
to
retire
two
halberds
fell
to
the
level
of
his
breast
ere
his
foot
had
quitted
the
marble
floor
and
he
now
saw
for
the
first
time
that
armed
men
crossed
his
passage
and
that
in
truth
he
was
a
prisoner
nature
had
endowed
the
fisherman
with
a
quick
and
just
perception
and
long
habit
had
given
great
steadiness
to
his
nerves
when
he
perceived
his
real
situation
instead
of
entering
into
useless
remonstrance
or
in
any
manner
betraying
alarm
he
again
turned
to
jacopo
with
an
air
of
patience
and
resignation
it
must
be
that
the
illustrious
signore
wish
to
do
me
justice
he
said
smoothing
the
remnant
of
his
hair
as
men
of
his
class
prepare
themselves
for
the
presence
of
their
superiors
and
it
would
not
be
decent
in
an
humble
fisherman
to
refuse
them
the
opportunity
it
would
be
better
however
if
there
were
less
force
used
here
in
venice
in
a
matter
of
simple
right
and
wrong
but
the
great
love
to
show
their
power
and
the
weak
must
submit
we
shall
see
answered
jacopo
who
had
manifested
no
emotion
during
the
abortive
attempt
of
the
other
to
retire
a
profound
stillness
succeeded
the
halberdiers
maintained
their
rigid
attitudes
within
the
shadow
of
the
wall
looking
like
two
insensible
statues
in
the
attire
and
armor
of
the
age
while
jacopo
and
his
companion
occupied
the
centre
of
the
room
with
scarcely
more
of
the
appearance
of
consciousness
and
animation
it
may
be
well
to
explain
here
to
the
reader
some
of
the
peculiar
machinery
of
the
state
in
the
country
of
which
we
write
and
which
is
connected
with
the
scene
that
is
about
to
follow
for
the
name
of
a
republic
a
word
which
if
it
mean
anything
strictly
implies
the
representation
and
supremacy
of
the
general
interests
but
which
has
so
frequently
been
prostituted
to
the
protection
and
monopolies
of
privileged
classes
may
have
induced
him
to
believe
that
there
was
at
least
a
resemblance
between
the
outlines
of
that
government
and
the
more
just
because
more
popular
institutions
of
his
own
country
in
an
age
when
rulers
were
profane
enough
to
assert
and
the
ruled
weak
enough
to
allow
that
the
right
of
a
man
to
govern
his
fellows
was
a
direct
gift
from
god
a
departure
from
the
bold
and
selfish
principle
though
it
were
only
in
profession
was
thought
sufficient
to
give
a
character
of
freedom
and
common
sense
to
the
polity
of
a
nation
this
belief
is
not
without
some
justification
since
it
establishes
in
theory
at
least
the
foundations
of
government
on
a
base
sufficiently
different
from
that
which
supposes
all
power
to
be
the
property
of
one
and
that
one
to
be
the
representative
of
the
faultless
and
omnipotent
ruler
of
the
universe
with
the
first
of
these
principles
we
have
nothing
to
do
except
it
be
to
add
that
there
are
propositions
so
inherently
false
that
they
only
require
to
be
fairly
stated
to
produce
their
own
refutation
but
our
subject
necessarily
draws
us
into
a
short
digression
on
the
errors
of
the
second
as
they
existed
in
venice
it
is
probable
that
when
the
patricians
of
mark
created
a
community
of
political
rights
in
their
own
body
they
believed
their
state
had
done
all
that
was
necessary
to
merit
the
high
and
generous
title
it
assumed
they
had
innovated
on
a
generally
received
principle
and
they
can
not
claim
the
distinction
of
being
either
the
first
or
the
last
who
have
imagined
that
to
take
the
incipient
steps
in
political
improvement
is
at
once
to
reach
the
goal
of
perfection
venice
had
no
doctrine
of
divine
right
and
as
her
prince
was
little
more
than
a
pageant
she
boldly
laid
claim
to
be
called
a
republic
she
believed
that
a
representation
of
the
most
prominent
and
brilliant
interests
in
society
was
the
paramount
object
of
government
and
faithful
to
the
seductive
but
dangerous
error
she
mistook
to
the
last
collective
power
for
social
happiness
it
may
be
taken
as
a
governing
principle
in
all
civil
relations
that
the
strong
will
grow
stronger
and
the
feeble
more
weak
until
the
first
become
unfit
to
rule
or
the
last
unable
to
endure
in
this
important
truth
is
contained
the
secret
of
the
downfall
of
all
those
states
which
have
crumbled
beneath
the
weight
of
their
own
abuses
it
teaches
the
necessity
of
widening
the
foundations
of
society
until
the
base
shall
have
a
breadth
capable
of
securing
the
just
representation
of
every
interest
without
which
the
social
machine
is
liable
to
interruption
from
its
own
movement
and
eventually
to
destruction
from
its
own
excesses
venice
though
ambitious
and
tenacious
of
the
name
of
a
republic
was
in
truth
a
narrow
a
vulgar
and
an
exceedingly
heartless
oligarchy
to
the
former
title
she
had
no
other
claim
than
her
denial
of
the
naked
principle
already
mentioned
while
her
practice
is
liable
to
the
reproach
of
the
two
latter
in
the
unmanly
and
narrow
character
of
its
exclusion
in
every
act
of
her
foreign
policy
and
in
every
measure
of
her
internal
police
an
aristocracy
must
ever
want
the
high
personal
feeling
which
often
tempers
despotism
by
the
qualities
of
the
chief
or
the
generous
and
human
impulses
of
a
popular
rule
it
has
the
merit
of
substituting
things
for
men
it
is
true
but
unhappily
it
substitutes
the
things
of
a
few
men
for
those
of
the
whole
it
partakes
and
it
always
has
partaken
though
necessarily
tempered
by
circumstances
and
the
opinions
of
different
ages
of
the
selfishness
of
all
corporations
in
which
the
responsibility
of
the
individual
while
his
acts
are
professedly
submitted
to
the
temporizing
expedients
of
a
collective
interest
is
lost
in
the
subdivision
of
numbers
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
italy
had
several
of
these
commonwealths
in
not
one
of
which
however
was
there
ever
a
fair
and
just
confiding
of
power
to
the
body
of
the
people
though
perhaps
there
is
not
one
that
has
not
been
cited
sooner
or
later
in
proof
of
the
inability
of
man
to
govern
himself
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
fallacy
of
a
reasoning
which
is
so
fond
of
predicting
the
downfall
of
our
own
liberal
system
supported
by
examples
drawn
from
transatlantic
states
of
the
middle
ages
it
is
necessary
only
to
recount
here
a
little
in
detail
the
forms
in
which
power
was
obtained
and
exercised
in
the
most
important
of
them
all
distinctions
in
rank
as
separated
entirely
from
the
will
of
the
nation
formed
the
basis
of
venetian
polity
authority
though
divided
was
not
less
a
birthright
than
in
those
governments
in
which
it
was
openly
avowed
to
be
a
dispensation
of
providence
the
patrician
order
had
its
high
and
exclusive
privileges
which
were
guarded
and
maintained
with
a
most
selfish
and
engrossing
spirit
he
who
was
not
born
to
govern
had
little
hope
of
ever
entering
into
the
possession
of
his
natural
rights
while
he
who
was
by
the
intervention
of
chance
might
wield
a
power
of
the
most
fearful
and
despotic
character
at
a
certain
age
all
of
senatorial
rank
for
by
a
specious
fallacy
nobility
did
not
take
its
usual
appellations
were
admitted
into
the
councils
of
the
nation
the
names
of
the
leading
families
were
inscribed
in
a
register
which
was
well
entitled
the
golden
book
and
he
who
enjoyed
the
envied
distinction
of
having
an
ancestor
thus
enrolled
could
with
a
few
exceptions
such
as
that
named
in
the
case
of
don
camillo
present
himself
in
the
senate
and
lay
claim
to
the
honors
of
the
horned
bonnet
neither
our
limits
nor
our
object
will
permit
a
digression
of
sufficient
length
to
point
out
the
whole
of
the
leading
features
of
a
system
so
vicious
and
which
was
perhaps
only
rendered
tolerable
to
those
it
governed
by
the
extraneous
contributions
of
captured
and
subsidiary
provinces
of
which
in
truth
as
in
all
cases
of
metropolitan
rule
the
oppression
weighed
most
grievously
the
reader
will
at
once
see
that
the
very
reason
why
the
despotism
of
the
republic
was
tolerable
to
its
own
citizens
was
but
another
cause
of
its
eventual
destruction
as
the
senate
became
too
numerous
to
conduct
with
sufficient
secresy
and
dispatch
the
affairs
of
a
state
that
pursued
a
policy
alike
tortuous
and
complicated
the
most
general
of
its
important
interests
were
intrusted
to
a
council
composed
of
three
hundred
of
its
members
in
order
to
avoid
the
publicity
and
delay
of
a
body
large
even
as
this
a
second
selection
was
made
which
was
known
as
the
council
of
ten
and
to
which
much
of
the
executive
power
that
aristocratical
jealousy
withheld
from
the
titular
chief
of
the
state
was
confided
to
this
point
the
political
economy
of
the
venetian
republic
however
faulty
had
at
least
some
merit
for
simplicity
and
frankness
the
ostensible
agents
of
the
administration
were
known
and
though
all
real
responsibility
to
the
nation
was
lost
in
the
superior
influence
and
narrow
policy
of
the
patricians
the
rulers
could
not
entirely
escape
from
the
odium
that
public
opinion
might
attach
to
their
unjust
or
illegal
proceedings
but
a
state
whose
prosperity
was
chiefly
founded
on
the
contribution
and
support
of
dependants
and
whose
existence
was
equally
menaced
by
its
own
false
principles
and
by
the
growth
of
other
and
neighboring
powers
had
need
of
a
still
more
efficient
body
in
the
absence
of
that
executive
which
its
own
republican
pretensions
denied
to
venice
a
political
inquisition
which
came
in
time
to
be
one
of
the
most
fearful
engines
of
police
ever
known
was
the
consequence
an
authority
as
irresponsible
as
it
was
absolute
was
periodically
confided
to
another
and
still
smaller
body
which
met
and
exercised
its
despotic
and
secret
functions
under
the
name
of
the
council
of
three
the
choice
of
these
temporary
rulers
was
decided
by
lot
and
in
a
manner
that
prevented
the
result
from
being
known
to
any
but
to
their
own
number
and
to
a
few
of
the
most
confidential
of
the
more
permanent
officers
of
the
government
thus
there
existed
at
all
times
in
the
heart
of
venice
a
mysterious
and
despotic
power
that
was
wielded
by
men
who
moved
in
society
unknown
and
apparently
surrounded
by
all
the
ordinary
charities
of
life
but
which
in
truth
was
influenced
by
a
set
of
political
maxims
that
were
perhaps
as
ruthless
as
tyrannic
and
as
selfish
as
ever
were
invented
by
the
evil
ingenuity
of
man
it
was
in
short
a
power
that
could
only
be
intrusted
without
abuse
to
infallible
virtue
and
infinite
intelligence
using
the
terms
in
a
sense
limited
by
human
means
and
yet
it
was
here
confided
to
men
whose
title
was
founded
on
the
double
accident
of
birth
and
the
colors
of
balls
and
by
whom
it
was
wielded
without
even
the
check
of
publicity
the
council
of
three
met
in
secret
ordinarily
issued
its
decrees
without
communicating
with
any
other
body
and
had
them
enforced
with
a
fearfulness
of
mystery
and
a
suddenness
of
execution
that
resembled
the
blows
of
fate
the
doge
himself
was
not
superior
to
its
authority
nor
protected
from
its
decisions
while
it
has
been
known
that
one
of
the
privileged
three
has
been
denounced
by
his
companions
there
is
still
in
existence
a
long
list
of
the
state
maxims
which
this
secret
tribunal
recognised
as
its
rule
of
conduct
and
it
is
not
saying
too
much
to
affirm
that
they
set
at
defiance
every
other
consideration
but
expediency
all
the
recognised
laws
of
god
and
every
principle
of
justice
which
is
esteemed
among
men
the
advances
of
the
human
intellect
supported
by
the
means
of
publicity
may
temper
the
exercise
of
a
similar
irresponsible
power
in
our
own
age
but
in
no
country
has
this
substitution
of
a
soulless
corporation
for
an
elective
representation
been
made
in
which
a
system
of
rule
has
not
been
established
that
sets
at
naught
the
laws
of
natural
justice
and
the
rights
of
the
citizen
any
pretension
to
the
contrary
by
placing
profession
in
opposition
to
practice
is
only
adding
hypocrisy
to
usurpation
it
appears
to
be
an
unavoidable
general
consequence
that
abuses
should
follow
when
power
is
exercised
by
a
permanent
and
irresponsible
body
from
whom
there
is
no
appeal
when
this
power
is
secretly
exercised
the
abuses
become
still
more
grave
it
is
also
worthy
of
remark
that
in
the
nations
which
submit
or
have
submitted
to
these
undue
and
dangerous
influences
the
pretensions
to
justice
and
generosity
are
of
the
most
exaggerated
character
for
while
the
fearless
democrat
vents
his
personal
complaints
aloud
and
the
voice
of
the
subject
of
professed
despotism
is
smothered
entirely
necessity
itself
dictates
to
the
oligarchist
the
policy
of
seemliness
as
one
of
the
conditions
of
his
own
safety
thus
venice
prided
herself
on
the
justice
of
mark
and
few
states
maintained
a
greater
show
or
put
forth
a
more
lofty
claim
to
the
possession
of
the
sacred
quality
than
that
whose
real
maxims
of
government
were
veiled
in
a
mystery
that
even
the
loose
morality
of
the
age
exacted
chapter
xii
a
power
that
if
but
named
in
casual
converse
be
it
where
it
might
the
speaker
lowered
at
once
his
voice
his
eyes
and
pointed
upward
as
at
god
in
heaven
rogers
the
reader
has
probably
anticipated
that
antonio
was
now
standing
in
an
antechamber
of
the
secret
and
stern
tribunal
described
in
the
preceding
chapter
in
common
with
all
of
his
class
the
fisherman
had
a
vague
idea
of
the
existence
and
of
the
attributes
of
the
council
before
which
he
was
to
appear
but
his
simple
apprehension
was
far
from
comprehending
the
extent
or
the
nature
of
functions
that
equally
took
cognizance
of
the
most
important
interests
of
the
republic
and
of
the
more
trifling
concerns
of
a
patrician
family
while
conjectures
on
the
probable
result
of
the
expected
interview
were
passing
through
his
mind
an
inner
door
opened
and
an
attendant
signed
for
jacopo
to
advance
the
deep
and
imposing
silence
which
instantly
succeeded
the
entrance
of
the
summoned
into
the
presence
of
the
council
of
three
gave
time
for
a
slight
examination
of
the
apartment
and
of
those
it
contained
the
room
was
not
large
for
that
country
and
climate
but
rather
of
a
size
suited
to
the
closeness
of
the
councils
that
had
place
within
its
walls
the
floor
was
tessellated
with
alternate
pieces
of
black
and
white
marble
the
walls
were
draped
in
one
common
and
sombre
dress
of
black
cloth
a
single
lamp
of
dark
bronze
was
suspended
over
a
solitary
table
in
its
centre
which
like
every
other
article
of
the
scanty
furniture
had
the
same
melancholy
covering
as
the
walls
in
the
angles
of
the
room
there
were
projecting
closets
which
might
have
been
what
they
seemed
or
merely
passages
into
the
other
apartments
of
the
palace
all
the
doors
were
concealed
from
casual
observation
by
the
hangings
which
gave
one
general
and
chilling
aspect
of
gloom
to
the
whole
scene
on
the
side
of
the
room
opposite
to
that
on
which
antonio
stood
three
men
were
seated
in
curule
chairs
but
their
masks
and
the
drapery
which
concealed
their
forms
prevented
all
recognition
of
their
persons
one
of
this
powerful
body
wore
a
robe
of
crimson
as
the
representative
that
fortune
had
given
to
the
select
council
of
the
doge
and
the
others
robes
of
black
being
those
which
had
drawn
the
lucky
or
rather
the
unlucky
balls
in
the
council
of
ten
itself
a
temporary
and
body
of
the
senate
there
were
one
or
two
subordinates
near
the
table
but
these
as
well
as
the
still
more
humble
officials
of
the
place
were
hidden
from
all
ordinary
knowledge
by
disguises
similar
to
those
of
the
chiefs
jacopo
regarded
the
scene
like
one
accustomed
to
its
effect
though
with
evident
reverence
and
awe
but
the
impression
on
antonio
was
too
manifest
to
be
lost
it
is
probable
that
the
long
pause
which
followed
his
introduction
was
intended
to
produce
and
to
note
this
effect
for
keen
eyes
were
intently
watching
his
countenance
during
its
continuance
thou
art
called
antonio
of
the
lagunes
demanded
one
of
the
secretaries
near
the
table
when
a
sign
had
been
secretly
made
from
the
crimson
member
of
that
fearful
tribunal
to
proceed
a
poor
fisherman
eccellenza
who
owes
much
to
blessed
saint
antonio
of
the
miraculous
draught
and
thou
hast
a
son
who
bears
thine
own
name
and
who
follows
the
same
pursuit
it
is
the
duty
of
a
christian
to
submit
to
the
will
of
god
my
boy
has
been
dead
twelve
years
come
the
day
when
the
republic
galleys
chased
the
infidel
from
corfu
to
candia
he
was
slain
noble
signore
with
many
others
of
his
calling
in
that
bloody
fight
there
was
a
movement
of
surprise
among
the
clerks
who
whispered
together
and
appeared
to
examine
the
papers
in
their
hands
with
some
haste
and
confusion
glances
were
sent
back
at
the
judges
who
sate
motionless
wrapped
in
the
impenetrable
mystery
of
their
functions
a
secret
sign
however
soon
caused
the
armed
attendants
of
the
place
to
lead
antonio
and
his
companion
from
the
room
here
is
some
inadvertency
said
a
stern
voice
from
one
of
the
masked
three
so
soon
as
the
fall
of
the
footsteps
of
those
who
retired
was
no
longer
audible
it
is
not
seemly
that
the
inquisition
of
mark
should
show
this
ignorance
it
touches
merely
the
family
of
an
obscure
fisherman
illustrious
signore
returned
the
trembling
dependant
and
it
may
be
that
his
art
would
wish
to
deceive
us
in
the
opening
interrogatories
thou
art
in
error
interrupted
another
of
the
three
the
man
is
named
antonio
vecchio
and
as
he
sayeth
his
only
child
died
in
the
hot
affair
with
the
ottoman
he
of
whom
there
is
question
is
a
grandson
and
still
a
boy
the
noble
signore
is
right
returned
the
clerk
in
the
hurry
of
affairs
we
have
misconceived
a
fact
which
the
wisdom
of
the
council
has
been
quick
to
rectify
mark
is
happy
in
having
among
his
proudest
and
oldest
names
senators
who
enter
thus
familiarly
into
the
interests
of
his
meanest
children
let
the
man
be
again
introduced
resumed
the
judge
slightly
bending
his
head
to
the
compliment
these
accidents
are
unavoidable
in
the
press
of
affairs
the
necessary
order
was
given
and
antonio
with
his
companion
constantly
at
his
elbow
was
brought
once
more
into
the
presence
thy
son
died
in
the
service
of
the
republic
antonio
demanded
the
secretary
signore
he
did
holy
maria
have
pity
on
his
early
fate
and
listen
to
my
prayers
so
good
a
child
and
so
brave
a
man
can
have
no
great
need
of
masses
for
his
soul
or
his
death
would
have
been
doubly
grievous
to
me
since
i
am
too
poor
to
buy
them
thou
hast
a
grandson
i
had
one
noble
senator
i
hope
he
still
lives
he
is
not
with
thee
in
thy
labors
on
the
lagunes
san
teodoro
grant
that
he
were
he
is
taken
signore
with
many
more
of
tender
years
into
the
galleys
whence
may
our
lady
give
him
a
save
deliverance
if
your
eccellenza
has
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
the
general
of
the
galleys
or
with
any
other
who
may
have
authority
in
such
a
matter
on
my
knees
i
pray
you
to
speak
in
behalf
of
the
child
who
is
a
good
and
pious
lad
that
seldom
casts
a
line
into
the
water
without
an
ave
or
a
prayer
to
anthony
and
who
has
never
given
me
uneasiness
until
he
fell
into
the
grip
of
st
mark
rise
this
is
not
the
affair
in
which
i
have
to
question
thee
thou
hast
this
day
spoken
of
thy
prayer
to
our
most
illustrious
prince
the
doge
i
have
prayed
his
highness
to
give
the
boy
liberty
and
this
thou
hast
done
openly
and
with
little
deference
to
the
high
dignity
and
sacred
character
of
the
chief
of
the
republic
i
did
it
like
a
father
and
a
man
if
but
half
what
they
say
of
the
justice
and
kindness
of
the
state
were
true
his
highness
would
have
heard
me
as
a
father
and
a
man
a
slight
movement
among
the
fearful
three
caused
the
secretary
to
pause
when
he
saw
however
that
his
superiors
chose
to
maintain
their
silence
he
continued
this
didst
thou
once
in
public
and
among
the
senators
but
when
repulsed
as
urging
a
petition
both
out
of
place
and
out
of
reason
thou
soughtest
other
to
prefer
thy
request
true
illustrious
signore
thou
camest
among
the
gondoliers
of
the
regatta
in
an
unseemly
garb
and
placed
thyself
foremost
with
those
who
contended
for
the
favor
of
the
senate
and
its
prince
i
came
in
the
garb
which
i
wear
before
the
virgin
and
antonio
and
if
i
was
foremost
in
the
race
it
was
more
owing
to
the
goodness
and
favor
of
the
man
at
my
side
than
any
virtue
which
is
still
left
in
these
withered
sinews
and
dried
bones
san
marco
remember
him
in
his
need
for
the
kind
wish
and
soften
the
hearts
of
the
great
to
hear
the
prayer
of
a
childless
parent
there
was
another
slight
expression
of
surprise
or
curiosity
among
the
inquisitors
and
once
more
the
secretary
suspended
his
examination
thou
hearest
jacopo
said
one
of
the
three
what
answer
dost
thou
make
the
fisherman
signore
he
speaketh
truth
and
thou
hast
dared
to
trifle
with
the
pleasures
of
the
city
and
to
set
at
naught
the
wishes
of
the
doge
if
it
be
a
crime
illustrious
senator
to
have
pitied
an
old
man
who
mourned
for
his
offspring
and
to
have
given
up
my
own
solitary
triumph
to
his
love
for
the
boy
i
am
guilty
there
was
along
and
silent
pause
after
his
reply
jacopo
had
spoken
with
habitual
reverence
but
with
the
grave
composure
that
appeared
to
enter
deeply
into
the
composition
of
his
character
the
paleness
of
the
cheek
was
the
same
and
the
glowing
eye
which
so
singularly
lighted
and
animated
a
countenance
that
possessed
a
hue
not
unlike
that
of
death
scarce
varied
its
gaze
while
he
answered
a
secret
sign
caused
the
secretary
to
proceed
with
his
duty
and
thou
owest
thy
success
in
the
regatta
antonio
to
the
favor
of
thy
competitor
he
who
is
now
with
thee
in
the
presence
of
the
council
under
san
teodoro
and
antonio
the
city
patron
and
my
own
and
thy
whole
desire
was
to
urge
again
thy
rejected
petition
in
behalf
of
the
young
sailor
signore
i
had
no
other
what
is
the
vanity
of
a
triumph
among
the
gondoliers
or
the
bauble
of
a
mimic
oar
and
chain
to
one
of
my
years
and
condition
thou
forgettest
that
the
oar
and
chain
are
gold
excellent
gentlemen
gold
can
not
heal
the
wounds
which
misery
has
left
on
a
heavy
heart
give
me
back
the
child
that
my
eyes
may
not
be
closed
by
strangers
and
that
i
may
speak
good
counsel
into
his
young
ears
while
there
is
hope
my
words
may
be
remembered
and
i
care
not
for
all
the
metals
of
the
rialto
thou
mayest
see
that
i
utter
no
vain
vaunt
by
this
jewel
which
i
offer
to
the
nobles
with
the
reverence
due
to
their
greatness
and
wisdom
when
the
fisherman
had
done
speaking
he
advanced
with
the
timid
step
of
a
man
unaccustomed
to
move
in
superior
presences
and
laid
upon
the
dark
cloth
of
the
table
a
ring
that
sparkled
with
what
at
least
seemed
to
be
very
precious
stones
the
astonished
secretary
raised
the
jewel
and
held
it
in
suspense
before
the
eyes
of
the
judges
how
is
this
exclaimed
he
of
the
three
who
had
oftenest
interfered
in
the
examination
that
seemeth
the
pledge
of
our
nuptials
it
is
no
other
illustrious
senator
with
this
ring
did
the
doge
wed
the
adriatic
in
the
presence
of
the
ambassadors
and
the
people
hadst
thou
aught
to
do
with
this
also
jacopo
sternly
demanded
the
judge
the
bravo
turned
his
eye
on
the
jewel
with
a
look
of
interest
but
his
voice
maintained
its
usual
depth
and
steadiness
as
he
answered
signore
no
until
now
i
knew
not
the
fortune
of
the
fisherman
a
sign
to
the
secretary
caused
him
to
resume
his
questions
thou
must
account
and
clearly
account
antonio
he
said
for
the
manner
in
which
the
sacred
ring
came
into
thy
possession
hadst
thou
any
one
to
aid
thee
in
obtaining
it
signore
i
had
name
him
at
once
that
we
take
measures
for
his
security
be
useless
signore
he
is
far
above
the
power
of
venice
what
meanest
thou
fellow
none
are
superior
to
the
right
and
the
force
of
the
republic
that
dwell
within
her
limits
answer
without
evasion
as
thou
valuest
thy
person
i
should
prize
that
which
is
of
little
value
signore
and
be
guilty
of
a
great
folly
as
well
as
of
a
great
sin
were
i
to
deceive
you
to
save
a
body
old
and
worthless
as
mine
from
stripes
if
your
excellencies
are
willing
to
hear
you
will
find
that
i
am
no
less
willing
to
tell
the
manner
in
which
i
got
the
ring
speak
then
and
trifle
not
i
know
not
signori
whether
you
are
used
to
hearing
untruths
that
you
caution
me
so
much
not
to
deal
with
them
but
we
of
the
lagunes
are
not
afraid
to
say
what
we
have
seen
and
done
for
most
of
our
business
is
with
the
winds
and
waves
which
take
their
orders
from
god
himself
there
is
a
tradition
signori
among
us
fishermen
that
in
times
past
one
of
our
body
brought
up
from
the
bay
the
ring
with
which
the
doge
is
accustomed
to
marry
the
adriatic
a
jewel
of
that
value
was
of
little
use
to
one
who
casts
his
nets
daily
for
bread
and
oil
and
he
brought
it
to
the
doge
as
became
a
fisherman
into
whose
hands
the
saints
had
thrown
a
prize
to
which
he
had
no
title
as
it
were
to
prove
his
honesty
this
act
of
our
companion
is
much
spoken
of
on
the
lagunes
and
at
the
lido
and
it
is
said
there
is
a
noble
painting
done
by
some
of
our
venetian
masters
in
the
halls
of
the
palace
which
tells
the
story
as
it
happened
showing
the
prince
on
his
throne
and
the
lucky
fisherman
with
his
naked
legs
rendering
back
to
his
highness
that
which
had
been
lost
i
hope
there
is
foundation
for
this
belief
signore
which
greatly
flatters
our
pride
and
is
not
without
use
in
keeping
some
among
us
truer
to
the
right
and
better
favored
in
the
eyes
of
anthony
than
might
otherwise
be
the
fact
was
so
and
the
painting
excellent
signore
i
hope
our
vanity
has
not
deceived
us
concerning
the
picture
neither
the
picture
you
mention
is
to
be
seen
within
the
palace
corpo
di
bacco
i
have
had
my
misgivings
on
that
point
for
it
is
not
common
that
the
rich
and
happy
should
take
such
note
of
what
the
humble
and
the
poor
have
done
is
the
work
from
the
hands
of
the
great
tiziana
himself
eccellenza
it
is
not
one
of
little
name
hath
put
his
pencil
to
the
canvas
they
say
that
tiziano
had
the
art
of
giving
to
his
work
the
look
and
richness
of
flesh
and
one
would
think
that
a
just
man
might
find
in
the
honesty
of
the
poor
fisherman
a
color
bright
enough
to
have
satisfied
even
his
eye
but
it
may
be
that
the
senate
saw
danger
in
thus
flattering
us
of
the
lagunes
proceed
with
the
account
of
thine
own
fortune
with
the
ring
illustrious
nobles
i
have
often
dreamed
of
the
luck
of
my
fellow
of
the
old
times
and
more
than
once
have
i
drawn
the
nets
with
an
eager
hand
in
my
sleep
thinking
to
find
that
very
jewel
entangled
in
its
meshes
or
embowelled
by
some
fish
what
i
have
so
often
fancied
has
at
last
happened
i
am
an
old
man
signore
and
there
are
few
pools
or
banks
between
fusina
and
giorgio
that
my
lines
of
my
nets
have
not
fathomed
or
covered
the
spot
to
which
the
bucentoro
is
wont
to
steer
in
these
ceremonies
is
well
known
to
me
and
i
had
a
care
to
cover
the
bottom
round
about
with
all
my
nets
in
the
hope
of
drawing
up
the
ring
when
his
highness
cast
the
jewel
i
dropped
a
buoy
to
mark
the
spot
signore
this
is
all
my
accomplice
was
st
anthony
for
doing
this
you
had
a
motive
holy
mother
of
god
was
it
not
sufficient
to
get
back
my
boy
from
the
gripe
of
the
galleys
exclaimed
antonio
with
an
energy
and
a
simplicity
that
are
often
found
to
be
in
the
same
character
i
thought
that
if
the
doge
and
the
senate
were
willing
to
cause
pictures
to
be
painted
and
honors
to
be
given
to
one
poor
fisherman
for
the
ring
they
might
be
glad
to
reward
another
by
releasing
a
lad
who
can
be
of
no
great
service
to
the
republic
but
who
is
all
to
his
parent
thy
petition
to
his
highness
thy
strife
in
the
regatta
and
thy
search
for
the
ring
had
the
same
object
to
me
signore
life
has
but
one
there
was
a
slight
but
suppressed
movement
among
the
council
when
thy
request
was
refused
by
his
highness
as
ah
eccellenza
when
one
has
a
white
head
and
a
failing
arm
he
can
not
stop
to
look
for
the
proper
moment
in
such
a
cause
interrupted
the
fisherman
with
a
gleam
of
that
impetuosity
which
forms
the
true
base
of
italian
character
when
thy
request
was
denied
and
thou
hadst
refused
the
reward
of
the
victor
thou
went
among
thy
fellows
and
fed
their
ears
with
complaints
of
the
injustice
of
mark
and
of
the
senate
tyranny
signore
no
i
went
away
sad
and
for
i
had
not
thought
the
doge
and
nobles
would
have
refused
a
successful
gondolier
so
light
a
boon
and
this
thou
didst
not
hesitate
to
proclaim
among
the
fishermen
and
idlers
of
the
lido
eccellenza
it
was
not
needed
my
fellows
knew
my
unhappiness
and
tongues
were
not
wanting
to
tell
the
worst
there
was
a
tumult
with
thee
at
its
head
and
sedition
was
uttered
with
much
of
what
the
fleet
of
the
lagunes
could
perform
against
the
fleet
of
the
republic
there
is
little
difference
signore
between
the
two
except
that
the
men
of
the
one
go
in
gondolas
with
nets
and
the
men
of
the
other
are
in
the
galleys
of
the
state
why
should
brothers
seek
each
other
blood
the
movement
among
the
judges
was
more
manifest
than
ever
they
whispered
together
and
a
paper
containing
a
few
lines
rapidly
written
in
pencil
was
put
into
the
hands
of
the
examining
secretary
thou
didst
address
thy
fellows
and
spoke
openly
of
thy
fancied
wrongs
thou
didst
comment
on
the
laws
which
require
the
services
of
the
citizens
when
the
republic
is
compelled
to
send
forth
a
fleet
against
its
enemies
it
is
not
easy
to
be
silent
signore
when
the
heart
is
full
and
there
was
a
consultation
among
thee
of
coming
to
the
palace
in
a
body
and
of
asking
the
discharge
of
thy
grandson
from
the
doge
in
the
name
of
the
rabble
of
the
lido
signore
there
were
some
generous
enough
to
make
the
offer
but
others
were
of
advice
it
would
be
well
to
reflect
before
they
took
so
bold
a
measure
and
thou
what
was
thine
own
counsel
on
that
point
eccellenza
i
am
old
and
though
unused
to
be
thus
questioned
by
illustrious
senators
i
had
seen
enough
of
the
manner
in
which
mark
governs
to
believe
a
few
unarmed
fishermen
and
gondoliers
would
not
be
listened
to
with
ha
did
the
gondoliers
become
of
thy
party
i
should
have
believed
them
jealous
and
displeased
with
the
triumph
of
one
who
was
not
of
their
body
a
gondolier
is
a
man
and
though
they
had
the
feelings
of
human
nature
on
being
beaten
they
had
also
the
feelings
of
human
nature
when
they
heard
that
a
father
was
robbed
of
his
son
signore
continued
antonio
with
great
earnestness
and
a
singular
simplicity
there
will
be
great
discontent
on
the
canals
if
the
galleys
sail
with
the
boy
aboard
them
such
is
thy
opinion
were
the
gondoliers
on
the
lido
numerous
when
the
sports
ended
eccellenza
they
came
over
by
hundreds
and
i
will
do
the
generous
fellows
the
justice
to
say
that
they
had
forgotten
their
want
of
luck
in
the
love
of
justice
diamine
these
gondoliers
are
not
so
bad
a
class
as
some
pretend
but
they
are
men
like
ourselves
and
can
feel
for
a
christian
as
well
as
another
the
secretary
paused
for
his
task
was
done
and
a
deep
silence
pervaded
the
gloomy
apartment
after
a
short
pause
one
of
the
three
resumed
antonio
vecchio
he
said
thou
hast
served
thyself
in
these
said
galleys
to
which
thou
now
seemest
so
averse
and
served
bravely
as
i
learn
signore
i
have
done
my
duty
by
mark
i
played
my
part
against
the
infidel
but
it
was
after
my
beard
was
grown
and
at
an
age
when
i
had
learnt
to
know
good
from
evil
there
is
no
duty
more
cheerfully
performed
by
us
all
than
to
defend
the
islands
and
the
lagunes
against
the
enemy
and
all
the
republic
thou
canst
make
no
distinctions
between
any
of
the
rights
of
the
state
there
is
wisdom
granted
to
the
great
which
god
has
denied
the
poor
and
the
weak
signore
to
me
it
does
not
seem
clear
that
venice
a
city
built
on
a
few
islands
hath
any
more
right
to
carry
her
rule
into
crete
or
candia
than
the
turk
hath
to
come
here
how
dost
thou
dare
on
the
lido
to
question
the
claim
of
the
republic
to
her
conquests
or
do
the
irreverent
fishermen
dare
thus
to
speak
lightly
of
her
glory
eccellenza
i
know
little
of
rights
that
come
by
violence
god
hath
given
us
the
lagunes
but
i
know
not
that
he
has
given
us
more
this
glory
of
which
you
speak
may
sit
lightly
on
the
shoulder
of
a
senator
but
it
weighs
heavily
on
a
fisherman
heart
thou
speakest
bold
man
of
that
which
thou
dost
not
comprehend
it
is
unfortunate
signore
that
the
power
to
understand
hath
not
been
given
to
those
who
have
so
much
power
to
suffer
an
anxious
pause
succeeded
this
reply
thou
mayest
withdraw
antonio
said
he
who
apparently
presided
in
the
dread
councils
of
the
three
thou
wilt
not
speak
of
what
has
happened
and
thou
wilt
await
the
inevitable
justice
of
mark
in
full
confidence
of
its
execution
thanks
illustrious
senator
i
will
obey
your
excellency
but
my
heart
is
full
and
i
would
fain
say
a
few
words
concerning
the
child
before
i
quit
this
noble
company
thou
mayest
speak
and
here
thou
mayest
give
free
vent
to
all
thy
wishes
or
to
all
thy
griefs
if
any
thou
hast
mark
has
no
greater
pleasure
than
to
listen
to
the
wishes
of
his
children
i
believe
they
have
reviled
the
republic
in
calling
its
chiefs
heartless
and
sold
to
ambition
said
the
old
man
with
generous
warmth
disregarding
the
stern
rebuke
which
gleamed
in
the
eye
of
jacopo
a
senator
is
but
a
man
and
there
are
fathers
and
children
among
them
as
among
us
of
the
lagunes
speak
but
refrain
from
seditious
or
discreditable
discourse
uttered
a
secretary
in
a
proceed
i
have
little
now
to
offer
signori
i
am
not
used
to
boast
of
my
services
to
the
state
excellent
gentlemen
but
there
is
a
time
when
human
modesty
must
give
way
to
human
nature
these
scars
were
got
in
one
of
the
proudest
days
of
mark
and
in
the
foremost
of
all
the
galleys
that
fought
among
the
greek
islands
the
father
of
my
boy
wept
over
me
then
as
i
have
since
wept
over
his
own
son
yes
i
might
be
ashamed
to
own
it
among
men
but
if
the
truth
must
be
spoken
the
loss
of
the
boy
has
drawn
bitter
tears
from
me
in
the
darkness
of
night
and
in
the
solitude
of
the
lagunes
i
lay
many
weeks
signori
less
a
man
than
a
corpse
and
when
i
got
back
again
to
my
nets
and
my
toil
i
did
not
withhold
my
son
from
the
call
of
the
republic
he
went
in
my
place
to
meet
the
infidel
a
service
from
which
he
never
came
back
this
was
the
duty
of
men
who
had
grown
in
experience
and
who
were
not
to
be
deluded
into
wickedness
by
the
evil
company
of
the
galleys
but
this
calling
of
children
into
the
snares
of
the
devil
grieves
a
father
and
i
will
own
the
weakness
if
such
it
be
i
am
not
of
a
courage
and
pride
to
send
forth
my
own
flesh
and
blood
into
the
danger
and
corruption
of
war
and
evil
society
as
in
days
when
the
stoutness
of
the
heart
was
like
the
stoutness
of
the
limbs
give
me
back
then
my
boy
till
he
has
seen
my
old
head
laid
beneath
the
sands
and
until
by
the
aid
of
blessed
anthony
and
such
counsels
as
a
poor
man
can
offer
i
may
give
him
more
steadiness
in
his
love
of
the
right
and
until
i
may
have
so
shaped
his
life
that
he
will
not
be
driven
about
by
every
pleasant
or
treacherous
wind
that
may
happen
to
blow
upon
his
bark
signori
you
are
rich
and
powerful
and
honored
and
though
you
may
be
placed
in
the
way
of
temptations
to
do
wrongs
that
are
suited
to
your
high
names
and
illustrious
fortunes
ye
know
little
of
the
trials
of
the
poor
what
are
the
temptations
of
the
blessed
anthony
himself
to
those
of
the
evil
company
of
the
galleys
and
now
signori
though
you
may
be
angry
to
hear
it
i
will
say
that
when
an
aged
man
has
no
other
kin
on
earth
or
none
so
near
as
to
feel
the
glow
of
the
thin
blood
of
the
poor
than
one
poor
boy
mark
would
do
well
to
remember
that
even
a
fisherman
of
the
lagunes
can
feel
as
well
as
the
doge
on
his
throne
this
much
i
say
illustrious
senators
in
sorrow
and
not
in
anger
for
i
would
get
back
the
child
and
die
in
peace
with
my
superiors
as
with
my
equals
thou
mayest
depart
said
one
of
the
three
not
yet
signore
i
have
still
more
to
say
of
the
men
of
the
lagunes
who
speak
with
loud
voices
concerning
this
dragging
of
boys
into
the
service
of
the
galleys
we
will
hear
their
opinions
noble
gentlemen
if
i
were
to
utter
all
they
have
said
word
for
word
i
might
do
some
disfavor
to
your
ears
man
is
man
though
the
virgin
and
the
saints
listen
to
his
aves
and
prayers
from
beneath
a
jacket
of
serge
and
a
fisherman
cap
but
i
know
too
well
my
duty
to
the
senate
to
speak
so
plainly
but
signori
they
say
saving
the
bluntness
of
their
language
that
mark
should
have
ears
for
the
meanest
of
his
people
as
well
as
for
the
richest
noble
and
that
not
a
hair
should
fall
from
the
head
of
a
fisherman
without
its
being
counted
as
if
it
were
a
lock
from
beneath
the
horned
bonnet
and
that
where
god
hath
not
made
marks
of
his
displeasure
man
should
not
do
they
dare
to
reason
thus
i
know
not
if
it
be
reason
illustrious
signore
but
it
is
what
they
say
and
eccellenza
it
is
holy
truth
we
are
poor
workmen
of
the
lagunes
who
rise
with
the
day
to
cast
our
nets
and
return
at
night
to
hard
beds
and
harder
fare
but
with
this
we
might
be
content
did
the
senate
count
us
as
christians
and
men
that
god
hath
not
given
to
all
the
same
chances
in
life
i
well
know
for
it
often
happens
that
i
draw
an
empty
net
when
my
comrades
are
groaning
with
the
weight
of
their
draughts
but
this
is
done
to
punish
my
sins
or
to
humble
my
heart
whereas
it
exceeds
the
power
of
man
to
look
into
the
secrets
of
the
soul
or
to
foretell
the
evil
of
the
still
innocent
child
blessed
anthony
knows
how
many
years
of
suffering
this
visit
to
the
galleys
may
cause
to
the
child
in
the
end
think
of
these
things
i
pray
you
signori
and
send
men
of
tried
principles
to
the
wars
thou
mayest
retire
rejoined
the
judge
i
should
be
sorry
that
any
who
cometh
of
my
blood
continued
the
inattentive
antonio
should
be
the
cause
of
between
them
that
rule
and
them
that
are
born
to
obey
but
nature
is
stronger
even
than
the
law
and
i
should
discredit
her
feelings
were
i
to
go
without
speaking
as
becomes
a
father
ye
have
taken
my
child
and
sent
him
to
serve
the
state
at
the
hazard
of
body
and
soul
without
giving
opportunity
for
a
parting
kiss
or
a
parting
blessing
ye
have
used
my
flesh
and
blood
as
ye
would
use
the
wood
of
the
arsenal
and
sent
it
forth
upon
the
sea
as
if
it
were
the
insensible
metal
of
the
balls
ye
throw
against
the
infidel
ye
have
shut
your
ears
to
my
prayers
as
if
they
were
words
uttered
by
the
wicked
and
when
i
have
exhorted
you
on
my
knees
wearied
my
stiffened
limbs
to
do
ye
pleasure
rendered
ye
the
jewel
which
anthony
gave
to
my
net
that
it
might
soften
your
hearts
and
reasoned
with
you
calmly
on
the
nature
of
your
acts
you
turn
from
me
coldly
as
if
i
were
unfit
to
stand
forth
in
defence
of
the
offspring
that
god
hath
left
my
age
this
is
not
the
boasted
justice
of
mark
venetian
senators
but
hardness
of
heart
and
a
wasting
of
the
means
of
the
poor
that
would
ill
become
the
most
grasping
hebrew
of
the
rialto
hast
thou
aught
more
to
urge
antonio
asked
the
judge
with
the
wily
design
of
unmasking
the
fisherman
entire
soul
is
it
not
enough
signore
that
i
urge
my
years
my
poverty
my
scars
and
my
love
for
the
boy
i
know
ye
not
but
though
ye
are
hid
behind
the
folds
of
your
robes
and
masks
still
must
ye
be
men
there
may
be
among
ye
a
father
or
perhaps
some
one
who
hath
a
still
more
sacred
charge
the
child
of
a
dead
son
to
him
i
speak
in
vain
ye
talk
of
justice
when
the
weight
of
your
power
falls
on
them
least
able
to
bear
it
and
though
ye
may
delude
yourselves
the
meanest
gondolier
of
the
canal
knows
he
was
stopped
from
uttering
more
by
his
companion
who
rudely
placed
a
hand
on
his
mouth
why
hast
thou
presumed
to
stop
the
complaints
of
antonio
sternly
demanded
the
judge
it
was
not
decent
illustrious
senators
to
listen
to
such
disrespect
in
so
noble
a
presence
jacopo
answered
bending
reverently
as
he
spoke
this
old
fisherman
dread
signori
is
warmed
by
love
for
his
offspring
and
he
will
utter
that
which
in
his
cooler
moments
he
will
repent
mark
fears
not
the
truth
if
he
has
more
to
say
let
him
declare
it
but
the
excited
antonio
began
to
reflect
the
flush
which
had
ascended
to
his
cheek
disappeared
and
his
naked
breast
ceased
to
heave
he
stood
like
one
rebuked
more
by
his
discretion
than
his
conscience
with
a
calmer
eye
and
a
face
that
exhibited
the
composure
of
his
years
and
the
respect
of
his
condition
if
i
have
offended
great
patricians
he
said
more
mildly
i
pray
you
to
forget
the
zeal
of
an
ignorant
old
man
whose
feelings
are
master
of
his
breeding
and
who
knows
less
how
to
render
the
truth
agreeable
to
noble
ears
than
to
utter
it
thou
mayest
depart
the
armed
attendants
advanced
and
obedient
to
a
sign
from
the
secretary
they
led
antonio
and
his
companion
through
the
door
by
which
they
had
entered
the
other
officials
of
the

and
the

chapter
xiii
oh
the
days
that
we
have
seen
shelton
a
pause
like
that
which
accompanies
and
perhaps
conscious
distrust
of
purpose
succeeded
then
the
three
arose
together
and
began
to
lay
aside
the
instruments
of
their
disguise
when
the
masks
were
removed
they
exposed
the
grave
visages
of
men
in
the
decline
of
life
athwart
which
worldly
cares
and
worldly
passions
had
drawn
those
deep
lines
which
no
subsequent
ease
or
resignation
can
erase
during
the
process
of
unrobing
neither
spoke
for
the
affair
on
which
they
had
just
been
employed
caused
novel
and
disagreeable
sensations
to
them
all
when
they
were
delivered
from
their
superfluous
garments
and
their
masks
however
they
drew
near
the
table
and
each
sought
that
relief
for
his
limbs
and
person
which
was
natural
to
the
long
restraint
he
had
undergone
there
are
letters
from
the
french
king
intercepted
said
one
after
time
had
permitted
them
to
rally
their
thoughts
it
would
appear
they
treat
of
the
new
intentions
of
the
emperor
have
they
been
restored
to
the
ambassador
or
are
the
originals
to
go
before
the
senate
demanded
another
on
that
we
must
take
counsel
at
our
leisure
i
have
naught
else
to
communicate
except
that
the
order
given
to
intercept
the
messenger
of
the
holy
see
hath
failed
of
its
object
of
this
the
secretaries
advertised
me
we
must
look
into
the
negligence
of
the
agents
for
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
much
useful
knowledge
would
have
come
from
that
seizure
as
the
attempt
is
already
known
and
much
spoken
of
care
must
be
had
to
issue
orders
for
the
arrest
of
the
robbers
else
may
the
republic
fall
into
disrepute
with
its
friends
there
are
names
on
our
list
which
might
be
readily
marked
for
punishment
for
that
quarter
of
our
patrimony
is
never
in
want
of
proscribed
to
conceal
an
accident
of
this
nature
good
heed
will
be
had
to
this
since
as
you
say
the
affair
is
weighty
the
government
or
the
individual
that
is
negligent
of
reputation
can
not
expect
long
to
retain
the
respect
of
its
equals
the
ambition
of
the
house
of
hapsburgh
robs
me
of
my
sleep
exclaimed
the
other
throwing
aside
some
papers
over
which
his
eye
had
glanced
in
disgust
holy
theodore
what
a
scourge
to
the
race
is
the
desire
to
augment
territories
and
to
extend
an
unjust
rule
beyond
the
bounds
of
reason
and
nature
here
have
we
in
venice
been
in
undisputed
possession
of
provinces
that
are
adapted
to
our
institutions
convenient
to
our
wants
and
agreeable
to
our
desires
for
ages
provinces
that
were
gallantly
won
by
our
ancestors
and
which
cling
to
us
as
habits
linger
in
our
age
and
yet
are
they
become
objects
of
a
covetous
ambition
to
our
neighbor
under
a
vain
pretext
of
a
policy
that
i
fear
is
strengthened
by
our
increasing
weakness
i
sicken
signori
of
my
esteem
for
men
as
i
dive
deeper
into
their
tempers
and
desires
and
often
wish
myself
a
dog
as
i
study
their
propensities
in
his
appetite
for
power
is
not
the
austrian
the
most
rapacious
of
all
the
princes
of
the
earth
more
so
think
you
worthy
signore
than
the
castilian
you
overlook
the
unsatiated
desire
of
the
spanish
king
to
extend
his
sway
in
italy
hapsburgh
or
bourbon
turk
or
englishman
they
all
seem
actuated
by
the
same
fell
appetite
for
dominion
and
now
that
venice
hath
no
more
to
hope
than
to
preserve
her
present
advantages
the
least
of
all
our
enjoyments
becomes
a
subject
of
covetous
envy
to
our
enemies
there
are
passions
to
weary
one
of
an
interference
with
governments
and
to
send
him
to
his
cord
of
penitence
and
the
cloisters
i
never
listen
to
your
observations
signore
without
quitting
the
chamber
an
edified
man
truly
this
desire
in
the
strangers
to
trespass
on
our
privileges
and
it
may
be
well
said
privileges
which
have
been
gained
by
our
treasures
and
our
blood
becomes
more
manifest
daily
should
it
not
be
checked
mark
will
be
stripped
in
the
end
of
even
a

much
curtailed
excellent
sir
or
these
things
might
not
be
it
is
no
longer
in
our
power
to
persuade
or
to
command
as
of
old
and
our
canals
begin
to
be
encumbered
with
slimy
weeds
instead
of
well
freighted
argosies
and
feluccas
the
portuguese
hath
done
us
irretrievable
harm
for
without
his
african
discoveries
we
might
yet
have
retained
the
traffic
in
indian
commodities
i
cordially
dislike
the
mongrel
race
being
as
it
is
half
gothic
and
half
moorish
i
trust
not
myself
to
think
of
their
origin
or
of
their
deeds
my
friends
lest
prejudice
should
kindle
feelings
unbecoming
a
man
and
a
christian
how
now
signor
gradenigo
thou
art
thoughtful
the
third
member
of
the
secret
council
who
had
not
spoken
since
the
disappearance
of
the
accused
and
who
was
no
other
than
the
reader
old
acquaintance
of
the
name
just
mentioned
slowly
lifted
his
head
from
a
meditative
position
at
this
address
the
examination
of
the
fisherman
hath
recalled
scenes
of
my
boyhood
he
answered
with
a
touch
of
nature
that
seldom
found
place
in
that
chamber
i
heard
thee
say
he
was
thy
returned
the
other
struggling
to
conceal
a
gape
we
drank
of
the
same
milk
and
for
the
first
years
of
life
we
spoiled
at
the
same
games
these
imaginary
kindred
often
give
great
uneasiness
i
am
glad
your
trouble
hath
no
other
source
for
i
had
heard
that
the
young
heir
of
your
house
hath
shown
a
prodigal
disposition
of
late
and
i
feared
that
matter
might
have
come
to
your
knowledge
as
one
of
the
council
that
a
father
might
not
wish
to
learn
the
selfish
features
of
the
signor
gradenigo
instantly
underwent
a
change
he
glanced
curiously
and
with
a
strong
distrust
but
in
a
covert
manner
at
the
fallen
eyes
of
his
two
companions
anxious
to
penetrate
their
secret
thoughts
ere
he
ventured
to
expose
his
own
is
there
aught
of
complaint
against
the
youth
he
demanded
in
a
voice
of
hesitation
you
understand
a
father
interest
and
will
not
conceal
the
truth
signore
you
know
that
the
agents
of
the
police
are
active
and
little
that
comes
to
their
knowledge
fails
to
reach
the
ears
of
the
council
but
at
the
worst
the
matter
is
not
of
life
or
death
it
can
only
cost
the
inconsiderate
young
man
a
visit
to
dalmatia
or
an
order
to
waste
the
summer
at
the
foot
of
the
alps
youth
is
the
season
of
indiscretion
as
ye
know
signori
returned
the
father
breathing
more
freely
and
as
none
become
old
that
have
not
been
young
i
have
little
need
to
awaken
your
recollection
of
its
weaknesses
i
trust
my
son
is
incapable
of
designing
aught
against
the
republic
of
that
he
is
not
suspected
a
slight
expression
of
irony
crossed
the
features
of
the
old
senator
as
he
spoke
but
he
is
represented
as
aiming
too
freely
at
the
person
and
wealth
of
your
ward
and
that
she
who
is
the
especial
care
of
mark
is
not
to
be
solicited
without
the
consent
of
the
senate
is
an
usage
well
known
to
one
of
its
most
ancient
and
most
honorable
members
such
is
the
law
and
none
coming
of
me
shall
show
it
disrespect
i
have
preferred
my
claims
to
that
connexion
openly
but
with
diffidence
and
i
await
the
decision
of
the
state
in
respectful
confidence
his
associates
bowed
in
courteous
acknowledgment
of
the
justice
of
what
he
said
and
of
the
loyalty
of
his
conduct
but
it
was
in
the
manner
of
men
too
long
accustomed
to
duplicity
to
be
easily
duped
none
doubt
it
worthy
signor
gradenigo
for
thy
faith
to
the
state
is
ever
quoted
as
a
model
for
the
young
and
as
a
subject
for
the
approbation
of
the
more
experienced
hast
thou
any
communications
to
make
on
the
interest
of
the
young
heiress
thyself
i
am
pained
to
say
that
the
deep
obligation
conferred
by
don
camillo
monforte
seems
to
have
wrought
upon
her
youthful
imagination
and
i
apprehend
that
in
disposing
of
my
ward
the
state
will
have
to
contend
with
the
caprice
of
a
female
mind
the
waywardness
of
that
age
will
give
more
trouble
than
the
conduct
of
far
graver
matters
is
the
lady
attended
by
suitable
companions
in
her
daily
life
her
companions
are
known
to
the
senate
in
so
grave
an
interest
i
would
not
act
without
their
authority
and
sanction
but
the
affair
hath
great
need
of
delicacy
in
its
government
the
circumstance
that
so
much
of
my
ward
fortune
lies
in
the
states
of
the
church
renders
it
necessary
to
await
the
proper
moment
for
disposing
of
her
rights
and
of
transferring
their
substance
within
the
limits
of
the
republic
before
we
proceed
to
any
act
of
decision
once
assured
of
her
wealth
she
may
be
disposed
of
as
seemeth
best
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
without
further
delay
the
lady
hath
a
lineage
and
riches
and
an
excellence
of
person
that
might
render
her
of
great
account
in
some
of
these
knotty
negotiations
which
so
much
fetter
our
movements
of
late
the
time
hath
been
when
a
daughter
of
venice
not
more
fair
was
wooed
to
the
bed
of
a
sovereign
signore
those
days
of
glory
and
greatness
exist
no
longer
should
it
be
thought
expedient
to
overlook
the
natural
claims
of
my
son
and
to
bestow
my
ward
to
the
advantage
of
the
republic
the
most
that
can
be
expected
through
her
means
is
a
favorable
concession
in
some
future
treaty
or
a
new
prop
to
some
of
the
many
decaying
interests
of
the
city
in
this
particular
she
maybe
rendered
of
as
much
or
even
more
use
than
the
oldest
and
wisest
of
our
body
but
that
her
will
may
be
free
and
the
child
may
have
no
obstacles
to
her
happiness
it
will
be
necessary
to
make
a
speedy
determination
of
the
claim
preferred
by
don
camillo
can
we
do
better
than
to
recommend
a
compromise
that
he
may
return
without
delay
to
his
own
calabria
the
concern
is
weighty
and
it
demands
deliberation
he
complains
of
our
tardiness
already
and
not
without
show
of
reason
it
is
five
years
since
the
claim
was
first
preferred
signor
gradenigo
it
is
for
the
vigorous
and
healthful
to
display
their
activity
the
aged
and
the
tottering
must
move
with
caution
were
we
in
venice
to
betray
precipitation
in
so
weighty
a
concern
without
seeing
an
immediate
interest
in
the
judgment
we
should
trifle
with
a
gale
of
fortune
that
every
sirocco
will
not
blow
into
the
canals
we
must
have
terms
with
the
lord
of
sant
agata
or
we
greatly
slight
our
own
advantage
i
hinted
of
the
matter
to
your
excellencies
as
a
consideration
for
your
wisdom
methinks
it
will
be
something
gained
to
remove
one
so
dangerous
from
the
recollection
and
from
before
the
eyes
of
a
maiden
is
the
damsel
so
amorous
she
is
of
italy
signore
and
our
sun
bestows
warm
fancies
and
fervent
minds
let
her
to
the
confessional
and
her
prayers
the
godly
prior
of
mark
will
discipline
her
imagination
till
she
shall
conceit
the
neapolitan
a
moor
and
an
infidel
just
san
teodoro
forgive
me
but
thou
canst
remember
the
time
my
friends
when
the
penance
of
the
church
was
not
without
service
on
thine
own
fickle
tastes
and
truant
practices
the
signore
gradenigo
was
a
gallant
in
his
time
observed
the
third
as
all
well
know
who
travelled
in
his
company
thou
wert
much
spoken
of
at
versailles
and
at
vienna
nay
thou
canst
not
deny
thy
vogue
to
one
who
if
he
hath
no
other
merit
hath
a
memory
i
protest
against
these
false
recollections
rejoined
the
accused
a
withered
smile
lighting
his
faded
countenance
we
have
been
young
signori
but
among
us
all
i
never
knew
a
venetian
of
more
general
fashion
and
of
better
report
especially
with
the
dames
of
france
than
he
who
has
just
spoken
account
it
not
account
it
not
was
the
weakness
of
youth
and
the
use
of
the
times
i
remember
to
have
seen
thee
enrico
at
madrid
and
a
gayer
or
more
accomplished
gentleman
was
not
known
at
the
spanish
court
thy
friendship
blinded
thee
i
was
a
boy
and
full
of
spirits
no
more
i
may
assure
thee
didst
hear
of
my
affair
with
the
mousquetaire
when
at
paris
did
i
hear
of
the
general
war
thou
art
too
modest
to
raise
this
doubt
of
a
meeting
that
occupied
the
coteries
for
a
month
as
it
had
been
a
victory
of
the
powers
signor
gradenigo
it
was
a
pleasure
to
call
him
countryman
at
that
time
for
i
do
assure
thee
a
sprightlier
or
more
gallant
gentleman
did
not
walk
the
terrace
thou
tellest
me
of
what
my
own
eyes
have
been
a
witness
did
i
not
arrive
when
men
voices
spoke
of
nothing
else
a
beautiful
court
and
a
pleasant
capital
were
those
of
france
in
our
day
signori
none
pleasanter
or
of
greater
freedom
of
intercourse
mark
aid
me
with
his
prayers
the
many
pleasant
hours
that
i
have
passed
between
the
marais
and
the
chateau
didst
ever
meet
la
comtesse
de
mignon
in
the
gardens
zitto
thou
growest
loquacious
caro
nay
she
wanted
not
for
grace
and
affability
that
i
will
say
in
what
a
manner
they
played
in
the
houses
of
resort
at
that
time
i
know
it
to
my
cost
will
you
lend
me
your
belief
dear
friends
i
arose
from
the
table
of
la
belle
duchesse
de
the
loser
of
a
thousand
sequins
and
to
this
hour
it
seemeth
but
a
moment
that
i
was
occupied
i
remember
the
evening
thou
wert
seated
between
the
wife
of
the
spanish
ambassador
and
a
miladi
of
england
thou
wert
playing
at
in
more
ways
than
one
for
thy
eyes
were
on
thy
neighbors
instead
of
thy
cards
giulio
i
would
have
paid
half
the
loss
to
have
read
the
next
epistle
of
the
worthy
senator
thy
father
he
never
knew
it
he
never
knew
it
we
had
our
friends
on
the
rialto
and
the
account
was
settled
a
few
years
later
thou
wast
well
with
ninon
enrico
a
companion
of
her
leisure
and
one
who
basked
in
the
sunshine
of
her
wit
nay
they
said
thou
wert
of
more
favor
mere
gossip
of
the
saloons
i
do
protest
gentlemen
not
that
others
were
better
received
but
idle
tongues
will
have
their
discourse
wert
thou
of
the
party
alessandro
that
went
in
a
fit
of
gaiety
from
country
to
country
till
it
numbered
ten
courts
at
which
it
appeared
in
as
many
weeks
was
i
not
its
mover
what
a
memory
art
thou
getting
was
for
a
hundred
golden
louis
and
it
was
bravely
won
by
an
hour
a
postponement
of
the
reception
by
the
elector
of
bavaria
went
near
to
defeat
us
but
we
bribed
the
groom
of
the
chambers
as
thou
mayest
remember
and
got
into
the
presence
as
it
were
by
accident
was
that
held
to
be
sufficient
that
was
it
for
our
terms
mentioned
the
condition
of
holding
discourse
with
ten
sovereigns
in
as
many
weeks
in
their
own
palaces
oh
it
was
fairly
won
and
i
believe
i
may
say
that
it
was
as
gaily
expended
for
the
latter
will
i
vouch
since
i
never
quitted
thee
while
a
piece
of
it
all
remained
there
are
divers
means
of
dispensing
gold
in
those
northern
capitals
and
the
task
was
quickly
accomplished
they
are
pleasant
countries
for
a
few
years
of
youth
and
idleness
it
is
a
pity
that
their
climates
are
so
rude
a
slight
and
general
shudder
expressed
their
italian
sympathy
but
the
discourse
did
not
the
less
proceed
they
might
have
a
better
sun
and
a
clearer
sky
but
there
is
excellent
cheer
and
no
want
of
hospitality
observed
the
signor
gradenigo
who
maintained
his
full
share
of
the
dialogue
though
we
have
not
found
it
necessary
to
separate
sentiments
that
were
so
common
among
the
different
speakers
i
have
seen
pleasant
hours
even
with
the
genoese
though
their
town
hath
a
cast
of
reflection
and
sobriety
that
is
not
always
suited
to
the
dispositions
of
youth
nay
stockholm
and
copenhagen
have
their
pleasures
too
i
do
assure
thee
i
passed
a
season
between
them
your
dane
is
a
good
joker
and
a
hearty
bottle
companion
in
that
the
englishman
surpasseth
all
if
i
were
to
relate
their
powers
of
living
in
this
manner
dear
friends
ye
would
discredit
me
that
which
i
have
seen
often
seemeth
impossible
even
to
myself
is
a
gloomy
abode
and
one
that
we
of
italy
little
like
in
common
name
it
not
in
comparison
with
holland
wert
ever
in
holland
friends
didst
ever
enjoy
the
fashion
of
amsterdam
and
the
hague
i
remember
to
have
heard
a
young
roman
urge
a
friend
to
pass
a
winter
there
for
the
witty
rogue
termed
it
the
of
the
land
of
petticoats
the
three
old
italians
in
whom
this
sally
excited
a
multitude
of
absurd
recollections
and
pleasant
fancies
broke
out
into
a
general
and
hearty
fit
of
laughter
the
sound
of
their
cracked
merriment
echoing
in
that
gloomy
and
solemn
room
suddenly
recalled
them
to
the
recollection
of
their
duties
each
listened
an
instant
as
if
in
expectation
that
some
extraordinary
consequence
was
to
follow
so
extraordinary
an
interruption
of
the
usual
silence
of
the
place
like
a
child
whose
truant
propensities
were
about
to
draw
detection
on
his
offence
and
then
the
principal
of
the
council
furtively
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
and
resumed
his
gravity
signori
he
said
fumbling
in
a
bundle
of
papers
we
must
take
up
the
matter
of
the
fisherman
but
we
will
first
inquire
into
the
circumstance
of
the
signet
left
the
past
night
in
the
lion
mouth
signor
gradenigo
you
were
charged
with
the
examination
the
duty
hath
been
executed
noble
sirs
and
with
a
success
i
had
not
hoped
to
meet
with
haste
at
our
last
meeting
prevented
a
perusal
of
the
paper
to
which
it
was
attached
but
it
will
now
be
seen
that
the
two
have
a
connexion
here
is
an
accusation
which
charges
don
camillo
monforte
with
a
design
to
bear
away
beyond
the
power
of
the
senate
the
donna
violetta
my
ward
in
order
to
possess
her
person
and
riches
it
speaketh
of
proofs
in
possession
of
the
accuser
as
if
he
were
an
agent
intrusted
by
the
neapolitan
as
a
pledge
of
his
truth
i
suppose
for
there
is
no
mention
made
of
any
other
use
he
sends
the
signet
of
don
camillo
himself
which
can
not
have
been
obtained
without
that
confidence
is
it
certain
that
he
owns
the
ring
of
that
i
am
well
assured
you
know
i
am
especially
charged
with
conducting
his
personal
demand
with
the
senate
and
frequent
interviews
have
given
me
opportunity
to
note
that
he
was
wont
to
wear
a
signet
which
is
now
wanting
my
jeweller
of
the
rialto
hath
sufficiently
identified
this
as
the
missing
ring
thus
far
it
is
clear
though
there
is
an
obscurity
in
the
circumstance
that
the
signet
of
the
accused
should
be
found
with
the
accusation
which
being
unexplained
renders
the
charge
vague
and
uncertain
have
you
any
clue
to
the
writing
or
any
means
of
knowing
whence
it
comes
there
was
a
small
but
nearly
imperceptible
red
spot
on
the
cheek
of
the
signor
gradenigo
that
did
not
escape
the
keen
distrust
of
his
companions
but
he
concealed
his
alarm
answering
distinctly
that
he
had
none
we
must
then
defer
a
decision
for
further
proof
the
justice
of
mark
hath
been
too
much
vaunted
to
endanger
its
reputation
by
a
hasty
decree
in
a
question
which
so
closely
touches
the
interest
of
a
powerful
noble
of
italy
don
camillo
monforte
hath
a
name
of
distinction
and
counteth
too
many
of
note
among
his
kindred
to
be
dealt
with
as
we
might
dispose
of
a
gondolier
or
the
messenger
of
some
foreign
state
as
respects
him
signore
you
are
undoubtedly
right
but
may
we
not
endanger
our
heiress
by
too
much
tenderness
there
are
many
convents
in
venice
signore
the
monastic
life
is
ill
suited
to
the
temper
of
my
ward
the
signor
gradenigo
drily
observed
and
i
fear
to
hazard
the
experiment
gold
is
a
key
to
unlock
the
strongest
cell
besides
we
can
not
with
due
observance
of
propriety
place
a
child
of
the
state
in
durance
signor
gradenigo
we
have
had
this
matter
under
long
and
grave
consideration
and
agreeably
to
our
laws
when
one
of
our
number
hath
a
palpable
interest
in
the
affair
we
have
taken
counsel
of
his
highness
who
is
of
accord
with
as
in
sentiment
your
personal
interest
in
the
lady
might
have
warped
your
usually
excellent
judgment
else
be
assured
we
should
have
summoned
you
to
the
conference
the
old
senator
who
thus
unexpectedly
found
himself
excluded
from
consultation
on
the
very
matter
that
of
all
others
made
him
most
value
his
temporary
authority
stood
abashed
and
silent
reading
in
his
countenance
however
a
desire
to
know
more
his
associates
proceeded
to
communicate
all
it
was
their
intention
he
should
hear
it
hath
been
determined
to
remove
the
lady
to
a
suitable
retirement
and
for
this
purpose
care
hath
been
already
had
to
provide
the
means
thou
wilt
be
temporarily
relieved
of
a
most
grievous
charge
which
can
not
but
have
weighed
heavily
on
thy
spirits
and
in
other
particulars
have
lessened
thy
usefulness
to
the
republic
this
unexpected
communication
was
made
with
marked
courtesy
of
manner
but
with
an
emphasis
and
tone
that
sufficiently
acquainted
the
signor
gradenigo
with
the
nature
of
the
suspicions
that
beset
him
he
had
too
long
been
familiar
with
the
sinuous
policy
of
the
council
in
which
at
intervals
he
had
so
often
sat
not
to
understand
that
he
would
run
the
risk
of
a
more
serious
accusation
were
he
to
hesitate
in
acknowledging
its
justice
teaching
his
features
therefore
to
wear
a
smile
as
treacherous
as
that
of
his
wily
companion
he
answered
with
seeming
gratitude
his
highness
and
you
my
excellent
colleagues
have
taken
counsel
of
your
good
wishes
and
kindness
of
heart
rather
than
of
the
duty
of
a
poor
subject
of
mark
to
toil
on
in
his
service
while
he
hath
strength
and
reason
for
the
task
he
said
the
management
of
a
capricious
female
mind
is
a
concern
of
no
light
moment
and
while
i
thank
you
for
this
consideration
of
my
case
you
will
permit
me
to
express
my
readiness
to
resume
the
charge
whenever
it
shall
please
the
state
again
to
confer
it
of
this
none
are
more
persuaded
than
we
nor
are
any
better
satisfied
of
your
ability
to
discharge
the
trust
faithfully
but
you
enter
signore
into
all
our
motives
and
will
join
us
in
the
opinion
that
it
is
equally
unbecoming
the
republic
and
one
of
its
most
illustrious
citizens
to
leave
a
ward
of
the
former
in
a
position
that
shall
subject
the
latter
to
unmerited
censure
believe
me
we
have
thought
less
of
venice
in
this
matter
than
of
the
honor
and
the
interests
of
the
house
of
gradenigo
for
should
this
neapolitan
thwart
our
views
you
of
us
all
would
be
most
liable
to
be
disapproved
of
a
thousand
thanks
excellent
sir
returned
the
deposed
guardian
you
have
taken
a
load
from
my
mind
and
restored
some
of
the
freshness
and
elasticity
of
youth
the
claim
of
don
camillo
now
is
no
longer
urgent
since
it
is
your
pleasure
to
remove
the
lady
for
a
season
from
the
city
better
to
hold
it
in
deeper
suspense
if
it
were
only
to
occupy
his
mind
keep
up
thy
communications
as
of
wont
and
withhold
not
hope
which
is
a
powerful
exciter
in
minds
that
are
not
deadened
by
experience
we
shall
not
conceal
from
one
of
our
number
that
a
negotiation
is
already
near
a
termination
which
will
relieve
the
state
from
the
care
of
the
damsel
and
at
some
benefit
to
the
republic
her
estates
lying
without
our
limits
greatly
facilitate
the
treaty
which
hath
only
been
withheld
from
your
knowledge
by
the
consideration
that
of
late
we
have
rather
too
much
overloaded
thee
with
affairs
again
the
signor
gradenigo
bowed
submissively
and
with
apparent
joy
he
saw
that
his
secret
designs
had
been
penetrated
notwithstanding
all
his
practised
duplicity
and
specious
candor
and
he
submitted
with
that
species
of
desperate
resignation
which
becomes
a
habit
if
not
a
virtue
in
men
long
accustomed
to
be
governed
despotically
when
this
delicate
subject
which
required
the
utmost
finesse
of
venetian
policy
since
it
involved
the
interests
of
one
who
happened
at
that
moment
to
be
in
the
dreaded
council
itself
was
disposed
of
the
three
turned
their
attention
to
other
matters
with
that
semblance
of
indifference
to
personal
feeling
which
practice
in
tortuous
paths
of
enabled
men
to
assume
since
we
are
so
happily
of
opinion
concerning
the
disposition
of
the
donna
violetta

observed
the
oldest
senator

rare

of
hackneyed
and
worldly
morality

may
look

your

true
what
a
head
for
business
hath
he
nothing
that
is
useful
escapeth
his
ready
mind
the
old
senator
while
he
was
too
experienced
to
be
cajoled
by
such
language
saw
the
necessity
of
appearing
flattered
again
he
bowed
and
protested
aloud
and
frequently
against
the
justice
of
compliments
that
he
so
little
merited
when
this
little
byplay
was
over
they
proceeded
gravely
to
consider
the
matter
before
them
as
the
decision
of
the
council
of
three
will
be
made
apparent
in
the
course
of
the
narrative
we
shall
not
continue
to
detail
the
conversation
that
accompanied
their
deliberations
the
sitting
was
long
so
long
indeed
that
when
they
arose
having
completed
their
business
the
heavy
clock
of
the
square
tolled
the
hour
of
midnight
the
doge
will
be
impatient
said
one
of
the
two
nameless
members
as
they
threw
on
their
cloaks
before
leaving
the
chamber
i
thought
his
highness
wore
a
more
fatigued
and
feeble
air
than
he
is
wont
to
exhibit
at
the
festivities
of
the
city
his
highness
is
no
longer
young
signore
if
i
remember
right
he
greatly
outnumbers
either
of
us
in
years
our
lady
of
loretto
lend
him
strength
long
to
wear
the
ducal
bonnet
and
wisdom
to
wear
it
well
he
hath
lately
sent
offerings
to
her
shrine
signore
he
hath
his
confessor
hath
gone
in
person
with
the
offering
as
i
know
of
certainty
is
not
a
serious
gift
but
a
mere
remembrance
to
keep
himself
in
the
odor
of
sanctity
i
doubt
that
his
reign
will
not
be
long
there
are
truly
signs
of
decay
in
his
system
he
is
a
worthy
prince
and
we
shall
lose
a
father
when
called
to
weep
for
his
loss
most
true
signore
but
the
horned
bonnet
is
not
an
invulnerable
shield
against
the
arrows
of
death
age
and
infirmities
are
more
potent
than
our
wishes
thou
art
moody
signor
gradenigo
thou
art
not
used
to
be
so
silent
with
thy
friends
i
am
not
the
less
grateful
signore
for
their
favors
if
i
have
a
loaded
countenance
i
bear
a
lightened
heart
one
who
hath
a
daughter
of
his
own
so
happily
bestowed
in
wedlock
as
thine
may
judge
of
the
relief
i
feel
by
this
disposition
of
my

joy

the

to

his
two
companions
looked
at
the
speaker
with
much
obvious
sympathy
in
their
manners
they
then
left
the
chamber
of
doom
together
the
menials
entered
and
extinguished
the
lights
leaving
all
behind
them
in
an
obscurity
that
was
no
bad
type
of
the
gloomy
mysteries
of
the
place
chapter
xiv
then
methought
a
serenade
broke
silence
breathing
hope
through
walls
of
stone
italy
notwithstanding
the
lateness
of
the
hour
the
melody
of
music
was
rife
on
the
water
gondolas
continued
to
glide
along
the
shadowed
canals
while
the
laugh
or
the
song
was
echoed
among
the
arches
of
the
palaces
the
piazza
and
piazzetta
were
yet
brilliant
with
lights
and
gay
with
their
multitudes
of
unwearied
revellers
the
habitation
of
donna
violetta
was
far
from
the
scene
of
general
amusement
though
so
remote
the
hum
of
the
moving
throng
and
the
higher
strains
of
the
came
from
time
to
time
to
the
ears
of
its
inmates
mellowed
and
thrilling
by
distance
the
position
of
the
moon
cast
the
whole
of
the
narrow
passage
which
flowed
beneath
the
windows
of
her
private
apartments
into
shadow
in
a
balcony
which
overhung
the
water
stood
the
youthful
and
ardent
girl
listening
with
a
charmed
ear
and
a
tearful
eye
to
one
of
those
soft
strains
in
which
venetian
voices
answered
to
each
other
from
different
points
on
the
canals
in
the
songs
of
the
gondoliers
her
constant
companion
and
mentor
was
near
while
the
ghostly
father
of
them
both
stood
deeper
in
the
room
there
may
be
pleasanter
towns
on
the
main
and
capitals
of
more
revelry
said
the
charmed
violetta
withdrawing
her
person
from
its
leaning
attitude
as
the
voices
ceased
but
in
such
a
night
and
at
this
witching
hour
what
city
may
compare
with
venice
providence
has
been
less
partial
in
the
distribution
of
its
earthly
favors
than
is
apparent
to
a
vulgar
eye
returned
the
attentive
carmelite
if
we
have
our
peculiar
enjoyments
and
our
moments
of
divine
contemplation
other
towns
have
advantages
of
their
own
genoa
and
pisa

ancona
roma
palermo
and
chiefest
of
all
napoli
napoli
father
daughter
napoli
of
all
the
towns
of
sunny
italy
is
the
fairest
and
the
most
blessed
in
natural
gifts
of
every
region
i
have
visited
during
a
life
of
wandering
and
penitence
that
is
the
country
on
which
the
touch
of
the
creator
hath
been
the
most
thou
art
imaginative
good
father
anselmo
the
land
must
be
fair
indeed
that
can
thus
warm
the
fancy
of
a
carmelite
the
rebuke
is
just
i
have
spoken
more
under
the
influence
of
recollections
that
came
from
days
of
idleness
and
levity
than
with
the
chastened
spirit
of
one
who
should
see
the
hand
of
the
maker
in
the
most
simple
and
least
lovely
of
all
his
wondrous
works
you
reproach
yourself
causelessly
holy
father
observed
the
mild
donna
florinda
raising
her
eyes
towards
the
pale
countenance
of
the
monk
to
admire
the
beauties
of
nature
is
to
worship
him
who
gave
them
being
at
that
moment
a
burst
of
music
rose
on
the
air
proceeding
from
the
water
beneath
the
balcony
donna
violetta
started
back
abashed
and
as
she
held
her
breath
in
wonder
and
haply
with
that
delight
which
open
admiration
is
apt
to
excite
in
a
youthful
female
bosom
the
color
mounted
to
her
temples
there
passeth
a
band
calmly
observed
the
donna
florinda
no
it
is
a
cavalier
there
are
gondoliers
servitors
in
his
colors
this
is
as
hardy
as
it
may
be
gallant
returned
the
monk
who
listened
to
the
air
with
an
evident
and
grave
displeasure
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
but
that
a
serenade
was
meant
though
the
custom
was
of
much
use
it
was
the
first
time
that
a
similar
honor
had
been
paid
beneath
the
window
of
donna
violetta
the
studied
privacy
of
her
life
her
known
destiny
and
the
jealousy
of
the
despotic
state
and
perhaps
the
deep
respect
which
encircled
a
maiden
of
her
tender
years
and
high
condition
had
until
that
moment
kept
the
aspiring
the
vain
and
the
interested
equally
in
awe
it
is
for
me
whispered
the
trembling
the
distressed
the
delighted
violetta
it
is
for
one
of
us
indeed
answered
the
cautious
friend
be
it
for
whom
it
may
it
is
bold
rejoined
the
monk
donna
violetta
shrank
from
observation
behind
the
drapery
of
the
window
but
she
raised
a
hand
in
pleasure
as
the
rich
strains
rolled
through
the
wide
apartments
what
a
taste
rules
the
band
she
afraid
to
trust
her
voice
lest
a
sound
should
escape
her
ears
they
touch
an
air
of
petrarch
sonatas
how
indiscreet
and
yet
how
noble
more
noble
than
wise
said
the
donna
florinda
who
entered
the
balcony
and
looked
intently
on
the
water
beneath
here
are
musicians
in
the
color
of
a
noble
in
one
gondola
she
continued
and
a
single
cavalier
in
another
hath
he
no
servitor
doth
he
ply
the
oar
himself
truly
that
decency
hath
not
been
overlooked
one
in
a
flowered
jacket
guides
the
boat
speak
then
dearest
florinda
i
pray
thee
would
it
be
seemly
indeed
i
think
it
speak
them
fair
say
that
i
am
the
senate
that
it
is
not
discreet
to
urge
a
daughter
of
the
state
thus
say
what
thou
wilt
but
speak
them
fair
ha
it
is
don
camillo
monforte
i
know
him
by
his
noble
stature
and
the
gallant
wave
of
his
hand
this
temerity
will
undo
him
his
claim
will
be
refused
himself
banished
is
it
not
near
the
hour
when
the
gondola
of
the
police
passes
admonish
him
to
depart
good
florinda
and
yet
can
we
use
this
rudeness
to
a
signor
of
his
rank
father
counsel
us
you
know
the
hazards
of
this
rash
gallantry
in
the
neapolitan
aid
us
with
thy
wisdom
for
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
the
carmelite
had
been
an
attentive
and
an
indulgent
observer
of
the
emotion
which
sensations
so
novel
had
awakened
in
the
ardent
but
unpractised
breast
of
the
fair
venetian
pity
sorrow
and
sympathy
were
painted
on
his
mortified
face
as
he
witnessed
the
mastery
of
feeling
over
a
mind
so
guileless
and
a
heart
so
warm
but
the
look
was
rather
that
of
one
who
knew
the
dangers
of
the
passions
than
of
one
who
condemned
them
without
thought
of
their
origin
or
power
at
the
appeal
of
the
governess
he
turned
away
and
silently
quitted
the
room
donna
florinda
left
the
balcony
and
drew
near
her
charge
there
was
no
explanation
nor
any
audible
or
visible
means
of
making
their
sentiments
known
to
each
other
violetta
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
her
more
experienced
friend
and
struggled
to
conceal
her
face
in
her
bosom
at
this
moment
the
music
suddenly
ceased
and
the
plash
of
oars
falling
into
the
water
succeeded
he
is
gone
exclaimed
the
young
creature
who
had
been
the
object
of
the
serenade
and
whose
faculties
spite
of
her
confusion
had
lost
none
of
their
acuteness
the
gondolas
are
moving
away
and
we
have
not
made
even
the
customary
acknowledgments
for
their
civility
it
is
not
needed
or
rather
it
might
increase
a
hazard
that
is
already
too
weighty
remember
thy
high
destiny
my
child
and
let
them
depart
and
yet
methinks
one
of
my
station
should
not
fail
in
courtesy
the
compliment
may
mean
no
more
than
any
other
idle
usage
and
they
should
not
quit
us
unthanked
rest
you
within
i
will
watch
the
movement
of
the
boats
for
it
surpasseth
female
endurance
not
to
note
their
aspect
thanks
dearest
florinda
hasten
lest
they
enter
the
other
canal
ere
thou
seest
them
the
governess
was
quickly
in
the
balcony
active
as
was
her
movement
her
eyes
were
scarcely
cast
upon
the
shadow
beneath
before
a
hurried
question
demanded
what
she
beheld
both
gondolas
are
gone
was
the
answer
that
with
the
musicians
is
already
entering
the
great
canal
but
that
of
the
cavalier
hath
unaccountably
disappeared
nay
look
again
he
can
not
be
in
such
haste
to
quit
us
i
had
not
sought
him
in
the
right
direction
here
is
his
gondola
by
the
bridge
of
our
own
canal
and
the
cavalier
he
waits
for
some
sign
of
courtesy
it
is
meet
that
we
should
not
withhold
it
i
see
him
not
his
servitor
is
seated
on
the
steps
of
the
landing
while
the
gondola
appeareth
to
be
empty
the
man
hath
an
air
of
waiting
but
i
nowhere
see
the
master
blessed
maria
can
aught
have
befallen
the
gallant
duca
di
agata
naught
but
the
happiness
of
casting
himself
here
exclaimed
a
voice
near
the
person
of
the
heiress
the
donna
violetta
turned
her
gaze
from
the
balcony
and
beheld
him
who
filled
all
her
thoughts
at
her
feet
the
cry
of
the
girl
the
exclamation
of
her
friend
and
a
rapid
and
eager
movement
of
the
monk
brought
the
whole
party
into
a
group
this
may
not
be
said
the
latter
in
a
reproving
voice
arise
don
camillo
lest
i
repent
listening
to
your
prayer
you
exceed
our
conditions
as
much
as
this
emotion
exceedeth
my
hopes
answered
the
noble
holy
father
it
is
a
sin
to
oppose
providence
providence
brought
me
to
the
rescue
of
this
lovely
being
when
accident
threw
her
into
the
giudecca
and
once
more
providence
is
my
friend
by
permitting
me
to
be
a
witness
of
this
feeling
speak
fair
violetta
thou
wilt
not
be
an
instrument
of
the
senate
selfishness
thou
wilt
not
hearken
to
their
wish
of
disposing
of
thy
hand
on
the
mercenary
who
would
trifle
with
the
most
sacred
of
all
vows
to
possess
thy
wealth
for
whom
am
i
destined
demanded
violetta
no
matter
since
it
be
not
for
me
some
trafficker
in
happiness
some
worthless
abuser
of
the
gifts
of
fortune
thou
knowest
camillo
our
venetian
custom
and
must
see
that
i
am
hopelessly
in
their
hands
arise
duke
of
agata
said
the
monk
with
authority
when
i
suffered
you
to
enter
this
palace
it
was
to
remove
a
scandal
from
its
gates
and
to
save
you
from
your
own
rash
disregard
of
the
displeasure
it
is
idle
to
encourage
hopes
that
the
policy
of
the
republic
opposes
arise
then
and
respect
your
pledges
that
shall
be
as
this
lady
may
decide
encourage
me
with
but
an
approving
look
fairest
violetta
and
not
venice
with
its
doge
and
inquisition
shall
stir
me
an
inch
from
thy
feet
camillo
answered
the
trembling
girl
thou
the
preserver
of
my
life
hast
little
need
to
kneel
to
me
duke
of
st
agata
daughter
nay
heed
him
not
generous
violetta
he
utters
words
of
convention
he
speaks
as
all
speak
in
age
when
men
tongues
deny
the
feelings
of
their
youth
he
is
a
carmelite
and
must
feign
this
prudence
he
never
knew
the
tyranny
of
the
passions
the
dampness
of
his
cell
has
chilled
the
ardor
of
the
heart
had
he
been
human
he
would
have
loved
had
he
loved
he
would
never
have
worn
a
cowl
father
anselmo
receded
a
pace
like
one
pricked
in
conscience
and
the
paleness
of
his
ascetic
features
took
a
deadly
hue
his
lips
moved
as
if
he
would
have
spoken
but
the
sounds
were
smothered
by
an
oppression
that
denied
him
utterance
the
gentle
florinda
saw
his
distress
and
she
endeavored
to
interpose
between
the
impetuous
youth
and
her
charge
it
may
be
as
you
say
signor
monforte
she
said
and
that
the
senate
in
its
fatherly
care
searches
a
partner
worthy
of
an
heiress
of
a
house
so
illustrious
and
so
endowed
as
that
of
tiepolo
but
in
this
what
is
there
more
than
of
wont
do
not
the
nobles
of
all
italy
seek
their
equals
in
condition
and
in
the
gifts
of
fortune
in
order
that
their
union
may
be
fittingly
assorted
how
know
we
that
the
estates
of
my
young
friend
have
not
a
value
in
the
eye
of
the
duke
of
agata
as
well
as
in
those
of
him
that
the
senate
may
elect
for
thy
husband
can
this
be
true
exclaimed
violetta
believe
it
not
my
errand
in
venice
is
no
secret
i
seek
the
restitution
of
lands
and
houses
long
withheld
from
my
family
with
the
honors
of
the
senate
that
are
justly
mine
all
these
do
i
joyfully
abandon
for
the
hope
of
thy
favor
thou
nearest
florinda
don
camillo
is
not
to
be
distrusted
what
are
the
senate
and
the
power
of
mark
that
they
should
cross
our
lives
with
misery
be
mine
lovely
violetta
and
in
the
fastnesses
of
my
own
good
calabrian
castle
we
will
defy
their
vengeance
and
policy
their
disappointment
shall
furnish
merriment
for
my
vassals
and
our
felicity
shall
make
the
happiness
of
thousands
i
affect
no
disrespect
for
the
dignity
of
the
councils
nor
any
indifference
to
that
i
lose
but
to
me
art
thou
far
more
precious
than
the
horned
bonnet
itself
with
all
its
fancied
influence
and
glory
generous
camillo
be
mine
and
spare
the
cold
calculators
of
the
senate
another
crime
they
think
to
dispose
of
thee
as
if
thou
wert
worthless
merchandise
to
their
own
advantage
but
thou
wilt
defeat
their
design
i
read
the
generous
resolution
in
thine
eye
violetta
thou
wilt
manifest
a
will
superior
to
their
arts
and
egotism
i
would
not
be
trafficked
for
don
camillo
monforte
but
wooed
and
won
as
befitteth
a
maiden
of
my
condition
they
may
still
leave
me
liberty
of
choice
the
signor
gradenigo
hath
much
encouraged
me
of
late
with
this
hope
when
speaking
of
the
establishment
suited
to
my
years
believe
him
not
a
colder
heart
a
spirit
more
removed
from
charity
exists
not
in
venice
he
courts
thy
favor
for
his
own
prodigal
son
a
cavalier
without
honor
the
companion
of
profligates
and
the
victim
of
the
hebrews
believe
him
not
for
he
is
stricken
in
deceit
he
is
the
victim
of
his
own
designs
if
this
be
true
of
all
the
youths
of
venice
i
esteem
giacomo
gradenigo
least
this
interview
must
have
an
end
said
the
monk
imposing
effectually
and
compelling
the
lover
to
rise
it
would
be
easier
to
escape
the
toils
of
sin
than
to
elude
the
agents
of
the
police
i
tremble
lest
this
visit
should
be
known
for
we
are
encircled
with
the
ministers
of
the
state
and
not
a
palace
in
venice
is
more
narrowly
watched
than
this
were
thy
presence
here
detected
indiscreet
young
man
thy
youth
might
pine
in
a
prison
while
thou
be
the
cause
of
persecution
and
unmerited
sorrow
to
this
innocent
and
inexperienced
maiden
a
prison
sayest
thou
father
no
less
daughter
lighter
offences
are
often
expiated
by
heavier
judgments
when
the
pleasure
of
the
senate
is
thwarted
thou
must
not
be
condemned
to
a
prison
camillo
fear
it
not
the
years
and
peaceful
calling
of
the
father
make
him
timid
i
have
long
been
prepared
for
this
happy
moment
and
i
ask
but
a
single
hour
to
put
venice
and
all
her
toils
at
defiance
give
me
the
blessed
assurance
of
thy
truth
and
confide
in
my
means
for
the
rest
thou
nearest
florinda
this
bearing
is
suited
to
the
sex
of
don
camillo
dearest
but
it
ill
becometh
thee
a
maiden
of
high
quality
must
await
the
decision
of
her
natural
guardians
but
should
that
choice
be
giacomo
gradenigo
the
senate
will
not
hear
of
it
the
arts
of
his
father
have
long
been
known
to
thee
and
thou
must
have
seen
by
the
secresy
of
his
own
advances
that
he
distrusts
their
decision
the
state
will
have
a
care
to
dispose
of
thee
as
befitteth
thy
hopes
thou
art
sought
of
many
and
those
who
guard
thy
fortune
only
await

as
one
beneath
me
the
monk
again
interposed
this
interview
must
end
he
said
the
eyes
drawn
upon
us
by
your
indiscreet
music
are
now
turned
on
other
objects
signore
and
you
must
break
your
faith
or
depart
alone
father
is
the
donna
violetta
to
quit
the
roof
of
her
father
with
as
little
warning
as
an
unfavored
dependant
nay
signor
monforte
you
could
not
in
reason
have
expected
more
in
this
interview
than
the
hope
of
some
future
termination
to
your
suit
some
pledge
and
that
pledge
the
eye
of
violetta
turned
from
her
governess
to
her
lover
from
her
lover
to
the
monk
and
from
the
latter
to
the
floor
is
thine
camillo
a
common
cry
escaped
the
carmelite
and
the
governess
thy
mercy
excellent
friends
continued
the
blushing
but
decided
violetta
if
i
have
encouraged
don
camillo
in
a
manner
that
thy
counsels
and
maiden
modesty
would
reprove
reflect
that
had
he
hesitated
to
cast
himself
into
the
giudecca
i
should
have
wanted
the
power
to
confer
this
trifling
grace
why
should
i
be
less
generous
than
my
preserver
no
camillo
when
the
senate
condemns
me
to
wed
another
than
thee
it
pronounces
the
doom
of
celibacy
i
will
hide
my
griefs
in
a
convent
till
i
die
there
was
a
solemn
and
fearful
interruption
to
a
discourse
which
was
so
rapidly
becoming
explicit
by
the
sound
of
the
bell
that
the
groom
of
the
chambers
a
and
confidential
domestic
had
been
commanded
to
ring
before
he
entered
as
this
injunction
had
been
accompanied
by
another
not
to
appear
unless
summoned
or
urged
by
some
grave
motive
the
signal
caused
a
sudden
pause
even
at
that
interesting
moment
how
now
exclaimed
the
carmelite
to
the
servant
who
abruptly
entered
what
means
this
disregard
of
my
injunctions
father
the
republic
is
mark
in
jeopardy
that
females
and
priests
are
summoned
to
aid
him
there
are
officials
of
the
state
below
who
demand
admission
in
the
name
of
the
republic
this
grows
serious
said
don
camillo
who
alone
retained
his
my
visit
is
known
and
the
active
jealousy
of
the
state
anticipates
its
object
summon
your
resolution
donna
violetta
and
you
father
be
of
heart
i
will
assume
the
responsibility
of
the
offence
if
offence
it
be
and
exonerate
all
others
from
censure
forbid
it
father
anselmo
dearest
florinda
we
will
share
his
punishment
exclaimed
the
terrified
violetta
losing
all
in
the
fear
of
such
a
moment
he
has
not
been
guilty
of
this
indiscretion
without
participation
of
mine
he
has
not
presumed
beyond
his
encouragement
the
monk
and
donna
florinda
regarded
each
other
in
mute
amazement
and
haply
there
was
some
admixture
of
feeling
in
the
look
that
denoted
the
uselessness
of
caution
when
the
passions
were
intent
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
those
who
were
merely
prompted
by
prudence
the
former
simply
motioned
for
silence
while
he
turned
to
the
domestic
of
what
character
are
these
ministers
of
the
state
he
demanded
father
they
are
its
known
officers
and
wear
the
badges
of
their
condition
and
their
request
is
to
be
admitted
to
the
presence
of
the
donna
violetta
there
is
still
hope
rejoined
the
monk
breathing
more
freely
moving
across
the
room
he
opened
a
door
which
communicated
with
the
private
oratory
of
the
palace
retire
within
this
sacred
chapel
don
camillo
while
we
await
the
explanation
of
so
extraordinary
a
visit
as
the
time
pressed
the
suggestion
was
obeyed
on
the
instant
the
lover
entered
the
oratory
and
when
the
door
was
closed
upon
his
person
the
domestic
one
known
to
be
worthy
of
all
confidence
was
directed
to
usher
in
those
who
waited
without
but
a
single
individual
appeared
he
was
known
at
a
glance
for
a
public
and
responsible
agent
of
the
government
who
was
often
charged
with
the
execution
of
secret
and
delicate
duties
donna
violetta
advanced
to
meet
him
in
respect
to
his
employers
and
with
the
return
of
that
which
long
practice
interweaves
with
the
habits
of
the
great
i
am
honored
by
this
care
of
my
dreaded
and
illustrious
guardians
she
said
making
an
acknowledgment
for
the
low
reverence
with
which
the
official
saluted
the
richest
ward
of
venice
to
what
circumstance
do
i
owe
this
visit
the
officer
gazed
an
instant
about
him
with
an
habitual
and
suspicious
caution
and
then
repeating
his
salutations
he
answered
lady
he
said
i
am
commanded
to
seek
an
interview
with
the
daughter
of
the
state
the
heiress
of
the
illustrious
house
of
tiepolo
with
the
donna
florinda
mercato
her
female
companion
with
the
father
anselmo
her
commissioned
confessor
and
with
any
other
who
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
her
society
and
the
honor
of
her
confidence
those
you
seek
are
here
i
am
violetta
tiepolo
to
this
lady
am
i
indebted
for
a
mother
care
and
this
reverend
carmelite
is
my
spiritual
counsellor
shall
i
summon
my
household
it
is
unnecessary
my
errand
is
rather
of
private
than
of
public
concern
at
the
decease
of
your
late
most
honored
and
much
lamented
parent
the
illustrious
senator
tiepolo
the
care
of
your
person
lady
was
committed
by
the
republic
your
natural
and
careful
protector
to
the
especial
guardianship
and
wisdom
of
signore
alessandro
gradenigo
of
illustrious
birth
and
estimable
qualities
signore
you
say
true
though
the
parental
love
of
the
councils
may
have
seemed
to
be
dormant
it
has
ever
been
wakeful
and
vigilant
now
that
the
years
instruction
beauty
and
other
excellences
of
their
daughter
have
come
to
so
rare
perfection
they
wish
to
draw
the
ties
that
unite
them
nearer
by
assuming
their
own
immediate
duties
about
her
person
by
this
i
am
to
understand
that
i
am
no
longer
a
ward
of
the
signor
gradenigo
lady
a
ready
wit
has
helped
you
to
the
explanation
that
illustrious
patrician
is
released
from
his
cherished
and
well
acquitted
duties
new
guardians
will
be
charged
with
the
care
of
your
prized
person
and
will
continue
their
honorable
trust
until
the
wisdom
of
the
senate
shall
have
formed
for
you
such
an
alliance
as
shall
not
disparage
a
noble
name
and
qualities
that
might
adorn
a
throne
am
i
to
be
separated
from
those
i
love
demanded
violetta
impetuously
trust
to
the
senate
wisdom
i
know
not
its
determination
concerning
those
who
have
long
dwelt
with
you
but
there
can
be
no
reason
to
doubt
its
tenderness
or
discretion
i
have
now
only
to
add
that
until
those
charged
anew
with
the
honorable
office
of
your
protectors
shall
arrive
it
will
be
well
to
maintain
the
same
modest
reserve
in
the
reception
of
visitors
as
of
wont
and
that
your
door
lady
must
in
propriety
be
closed
against
the
signor
gradenigo
as
against
all
others
of
his
sex
shall
i
not
even
thank
him
for
his
care
he
is
tenfold
rewarded
in
the
senate
gratitude
it
would
have
been
gracious
to
have
expressed
my
feelings
towards
the
signor
gradenigo
in
words
but
that
which
is
refused
to
the
tongue
will
be
permitted
to
the
pen
the
reserve
that
becomes
the
state
of
one
so
favored
is
absolute
mark
is
jealous
where
he
loves
and
now
my
commission
is
discharged
i
humbly
take
my
leave
flattered
in
having
been
selected
to
stand
in
such
a
presence
and
to
have
been
thought
worthy
of
so
honorable
a
duty
as
the
officer
ceased
speaking
and
violetta
returned
his
bows
she
fixed
her
eyes
filled
with
apprehension
on
the
sorrowful
features
of
her
companions
the
ambiguous
language
of
those
employed
in
such
missions
was
too
well
known
to
leave
much
hope
for
the
future
they
all
anticipated
their
separation
on
the
morrow
though
neither
could
penetrate
the
reason
of
this
sudden
change
in
the
policy
of
the
state
interrogation
was
useless
for
the
blow
evidently
came
from
the
secret
council
whose
motives
could
no
more
be
fathomed
than
its
decrees
foreseen
the
monk
raised
his
hands
in
silent
benediction
towards
his
spiritual
charge
and
unable
even
in
the
presence
of
the
stranger
to
repress
their
grief
donna
florinda
and
violetta
sank
into
each
arms
and
wept
in
the
mean
time
the
minister
of
this
cruel
blow
had
delayed
his
departure
like
one
who
had
a
resolution
he
regarded
the
countenance
of
the
unconscious
carmelite
intently
and
in
a
manner
that
denoted
the
habit
of
thinking
much
before
he
decided
reverend
father
he
said
may
i
crave
a
moment
of
your
time
for
an
affair
that
concerns
the
soul
of
a
sinner
though
amazed
the
monk
could
not
hesitate
about
answering
such
an
appeal
obedient
to
a
gesture
of
the
officer
he
followed
him
from
the
apartment
and
continued
at
his
side
while
the
other
threaded
the
magnificent
rooms
and
descended
to
his
gondola
you
must
be
much
honored
of
the
senate
holy
monk
observed
the
latter
while
they
proceeded
to
hold
so
near
a
trust
about
the
person
of
one
in
whom
the
state
takes
so
great
an
interest
i
feel
it
as
such
my
son
a
life
of
peace
and
prayer
should
have
made
me

men
like
you

merit
the
esteem
they
crave
are
you
long
of
venice
since
the
last
conclave
i
came
into
the
republic
as
confessor
to
the
late
minister
from
florence
an
honorable
trust
you
have
been
with
us
then
long
enough
to
know
that
the
republic
never
forgets
a
servitor
nor
forgives
an
affront
is
an
ancient
state
and
one
whose
influence
still
reaches
far
and
near
have
a
care
of
the
step
these
marbles
are
treacherous
to
an
uncertain
foot
mine
is
too
practised
in
the
descent
to
be
unsteady
i
hope
i
do
not
now
descend
these
stairs
for
the
last
time
the
minister
of
the
council
affected
not
to
understand
the
question
but
he
answered
as
if
replying
only
to
the
previous
observation
is
truly
a
venerable
state
he
said
but
a
little
tottering
with
its
years
all
who
love
liberty
father
must
mourn
to
see
so
glorious
a
sway
on
the
decline

you
carmelites
do
well
to
mortify
the
flesh
in
youth
by
which
you
escape
the
pains
of
a
decreasing
power
one
like
you
can
have
few
wrongs
of
his
younger
days
to
repair
we
are
none
of
us
without
sin
returned
the
monk
crossing
himself
he
who
would
flatter
his
soul
with
being
perfect
lays
the
additional
weight
of
vanity
on
his
life
men
of
my
occupation

few
opportunities
of
looking
into
themselves
and
i
bless
the
hour
that
hath
brought
me
into
company
so
godly
my
gondola
waits
will
you
enter
the
monk
regarded
his
companion
in
distrust
but
knowing
the
uselessness
of
resistance
he
murmured
a
short
prayer
and
complied
a
strong
dash
of
the
oars
announced
their
departure
from
the
steps
of
the

the

was
at

its
rays
fell
in
a
flood
on
the
swelling
domes
and
massive
roofs
of
venice
while
the
margin
of
the
town
was
brilliantly
defined
by
the
glittering
bay
the
natural
and
gorgeous
setting
was
more
than

at

rich
as
was

the

the

the
broad

endless
to
the
eye
tranquil
as
the
vault
it
reflected
and
luminous
with
its
borrowed
light
here
and
there
a
low
island
reclaimed
from
the
sea
by
the
patient
toil
of
a
thousand
years
dotted
the
lagunes
burdened
with
the
group
of
some
conventual
dwellings
or
picturesque
with
the
modest
roofs
of
a
hamlet
of
the
fisherman
neither
oar
nor
song
nor
laugh
nor
flap
of
sail
nor
jest
of
mariner
disturbed
the
stillness
all
in
the
near
view
was
clothed
in
midnight
loveliness
and
all
in
the
distance
bespoke
the
solemnity
of
nature
at
peace
the
city
and
the
lagunes
the
gulf
and
the
dreamy
alps
the
interminable
plain
of
lombardy
and
the
blue
void
of
heaven
lay
alike
in
a
common
and
grand
repose
there
suddenly
appeared
a
gondola
it
issued
from
among
the
watery
channels
of
the
town
and
glided
upon
the
vast
bosom
of
the
bay
noiseless
as
the
fancied
progress
of
a
spirit
a
practised
and
nervous
arm
guided
its
movement
which
was
unceasing
and
rapid
so
swift
indeed
was
the
passage
of
the
boat
as
to
denote
pressing
haste
on
the
part
of
the
solitary
individual
it
contained
it
held
the
direction
of
the
adriatic
steering
between
one
of
the
more
southern
outlets
of
the
bay
and
the
well
known
island
of
giorgio
for
half
an
hour
the
exertions
of
the
gondolier
were
unrelaxed
though
his
eye
was
often
cast
behind
him
as
if
he
distrusted
pursuit
and
as
often
did
he
gaze
ahead
betraying
an
anxious
desire
to
reach
some
object
that
was
yet
invisible
when
a
wide
reach
of
water
lay
between
him
and
the
town
however
he
permitted
his
oar
to
rest
and
he
lent
all
his
faculties
to
a
keen
and
anxious
search
a
small
dark
spot
was
discovered
on
the
water
still
nearer
to
the
sea
the
oar
of
the
gondolier
dashed
the
element
behind
him
and
his
boat
again
glided
away
so
far
altering
its
course
as
to
show
that
all
indecision
was
now
ended
the
darker
spot
was
shortly
beheld
quivering
in
the
rays
of
the
moon
and
it
soon
assumed
the
form
and
dimensions
of
a
boat
at
anchor
again
the
gondolier
ceased
his
efforts
and
he
leaned
forward
gazing
intently
at
this
undefined
object
as
if
he
would
aid
his
powers
of
sight
by
the
sympathy
of
his
other
faculties
just
then
the
notes
of
music
came
softly
across
the
lagunes
the
voice
was
feeble
even
to
trembling
but
it
had
the
sweetness
of
tone
and
the
accuracy
of
execution
which
belong
so
peculiarly
to
venice
it
was
the
solitary
man
in
the
distant
boat
indulging
in
the
song
of
a
fisherman
the
strains
were
sweet
and
the
intonations
plaintive
to
melancholy
the
air
was
common
to
all
who
plied
the
oar
in
the
canals
and
familiar
to
the
ear
of
the
listener
he
waited
until
the
close
of
a
verse
had
died
away
and
then
he
answered
with
a
strain
of
his
own
the
alternate
parts
were
thus
maintained
until
the
music
ceased
by
the
two
singing
a
final
verse
in
chorus
when
the
song
was
ended
the
oar
of
the
gondolier
stirred
the
water
again
and
he
was
quickly
by
the
other
side
thou
art
busy
with
thy
hook

antonio
said
he
who
had
just
arrived
as
he
stepped
into
the
boat
of
the
old
fisherman
already
so
well
known
to
the
reader
there
are
men
that
an
interview
with
the
council
of
three
would
have
sent
to
their
prayers
and
a
sleepless
bed
there
is
not
a
chapel
in
venice
jacopo
in
which
a
sinner
may
so
well
lay
bare
his
soul
as
in
this
i
have
been
here
on
the
empty
lagunes
alone
with
god
having
the
gates
of
paradise
open
before
my
eyes
one
like
thee
hath
no
need
of
images
to
quicken
his
devotion
i
see
the
image
of
my
saviour
jacopo
in
those
bright
stars
that
moon
the
blue
heavens
the
misty
bank
of
mountain
the
waters
on
which
we
float
aye
even
in
my
own
sinking
form
as
in
all
which
has
come
from
his
wisdom
and
power
i
have
prayed
much
since
the
moon
has
risen
and
is
habit
so
strong
in
thee
that
thou
thinkest
of
god
and
thy
sins
while
thou
anglest
the
poor
must
toil
and
the
sinful
must
pray
my
thoughts
have
dwelt
so
much
of
late
on
the
boy
that
i
have
forgotten
to
provide
myself
with
food
if
i
fish
later
or
earlier
than
common
is
because
a
man
can
not
live
on
grief
i
have
bethought
me
of
thy
situation
honest
antonio
here
is
that
which
will
support
life
and
raise
thy
courage
see
added
the
bravo
stretching
forth
an
arm
into
his
own
gondola
from
which
he
drew
a
basket
here
is
bread
from
dalmatia
wine
of
lower
italy
and
figs
from
the
levant
eat
then
and
be
of
cheer
the
fisherman
threw
a
wistful
glance
at
the
viands
for
hunger
was
making
powerful
appeals
to
the
weakness
of
nature
but
his
hand
did
not
relinquish
its
hold
of
the
line
with
which
he
still
continued
to
angle
and
these
are
thy
gifts
jacopo
he
asked
in
a
voice
that
spite
of
his
resignation
betrayed
the
longings
of
appetite
antonio
they
are
the
offerings
of
one
who
respects
thy
courage
and
honors
thy
nature
bought
with
his
earnings
can
it
be
otherwise
i
am
no
beggar
for
the
love
of
the
saints
and
few
in
venice
give
unasked
eat
then
without
fear
seldom
wilt
thou
be
more
welcome
take
them
away
jacopo
if
thou
lovest
me
do
not
tempt
me
beyond
what
i
can
bear
how
art
thou
commanded
to
a
penance
hastily
exclaimed
the
other
not
so
not
so
it
is
long
since
i
have
found
leisure
or
heart
for
the
confessional
then
why
refuse
the
gift
of
a
friend
remember
thy
years
and
necessities
i
can
not
feed
on
the
price
of
blood
the
hand
of
the
bravo
was
withdrawn
as
if
repelled
by
an
electric
touch
the
action
caused
the
rays
of
the
moon
to
fall
athwart
his
kindling
eye
and
firm
as
antonio
was
in
honesty
and
principle
he
felt
the
blood
creep
to
his
heart
as
he
encountered
the
fierce
and
sudden
glance
of
his
companion
a
long
pause
succeeded
during
which
the
fisherman
diligently
plied
his
line
though
utterly
regardless
of
the
object
for
which
it
had
been
cast
i
have
said
it
jacopo
he
added
at
length
and
tongue
of
mine
shall
not
belie
the
thought
of
my
heart
take
away
thy
food
then
and
forget
all
that
is
past
for
what
i
have
said
hath
not
been
said
in
scorn
but
out
of
regard
to
my
own
soul
thou
knowest
how
i
have
sorrowed
for
the
boy
but
next
to
his
loss
i
could
mourn
over
thee
aye
more
bitterly
than
over
any
other
of
the
fallen
the
hard
breathing
of
the
bravo
was
audible
but
still
he
spoke
not
jacopo
continued
the
anxious
fisherman
do
not
mistake
me
the
pity
of
the
suffering
and
poor
is
not
like
the
scorn
of
the
rich
and
worldly
if
i
touch
a
sore
i
do
not
bruise
it
with
my
heel
thy
present
pain
is
better
than
the
greatest
of
all
thy
former
joys
enough
old
man
said
the
other
in
a
smothered
voice
thy
words
are
forgotten
eat
without
fear
for
the
offering
is
bought
with
earnings
as
pure
as
the
gleanings
of
a
mendicant
friar
i
will
trust
to
the
kindness
of
anthony
and
the
fortune
of
my
hook
simply
returned
antonio
is
common
for
us
of
the
lagunes
to
go
to
a
supperless
bed
take
away
the
basket
good
jacopo
and
let
us
speak
of
other
things
the
bravo
ceased
to
press
his
food
upon
the
fisherman
laying
aside
his
basket
he
sat
brooding
over
what
had
occurred
hast
thou
come
thus
far
for
naught
else
good
jacopo
demanded
the
old
man
willing
to
weaken
the
shock
of
his
refusal
the
question
appeared
to
restore
jacopo
to
a
recollection
of
his
errand
he
stood
erect
and
looked
about
him
for
more
than
a
minute
with
a
keen
eye
and
an
entire
intentness
of
purpose
the
look
in
the
direction
of
the
city
was
longer
and
more
earnest
than
those
thrown
towards
the
sea
and
the
main
nor
was
it
withdrawn
until
an
involuntary
start
betrayed
equally
surprise
and
alarm
is
there
not
a
boat
here
in
a
line
with
the
tower
of
the
campanile
he
asked
quickly
pointing
towards
the
city
it
so
seems
it
is
early
for
my
comrades
to
be
abroad
but
the
draughts
have
not
been
heavy
of
late
and
the
revelry
of
yesterday
drew
many
of
our
people
from
their
toil
the
patricians
must
eat
and
the
poor
must
labor
or
both
would
die
the
bravo
slowly
seated
himself
and
he
looked
with
concern
into
the
countenance
of
his
companion
art
thou
long
here
antonio
but
an
hour
when
they
turned
us
away
from
the
palace
thou
knowest
that
i
told
thee
of
my
necessities
there
is
not
in
common
a
more
certain
spot
on
the
lagunes
than
this
and
yet
have
i
long
played
the
line
in
vain
the
trial
of
hunger
is
hard
but
like
all
other
trials
it
must
be
borne
i
have
prayed
to
my
patron
thrice
and
sooner
or
later
he
will
listen
to
my
wants
thou
art
used
to
the
manners
of
these
masked
nobles
jacopo
dost
thou
think
them
likely
to
hearken
to
reason
i
hope
i
did
the
cause
no
wrong
for
want
of
breeding
but
i
spoke
them
fair
and
plainly
as
fathers
and
men
with
hearts
as
senators
they
have
none
thou
little
understandest
antonio
the
distinctions
of
these
patricians
in
the
gaiety
of
their
palaces
and
among
the
companions
of
their
pleasures
none
will
speak
you
fairer
of
humanity
and
justice
aye
even
of
god
but
when
met
to
discuss
what
they
call
the
interests
of
mark
there
is
not
a
rock
on
the
coldest
peak
of
yonder
alp
with
less
humanity
or
a
wolf
among
their
valleys
more
heartless
thy
words
are
strong
jacopo
i
would
not
do
injustice
even
to
those
who
have
done
me
this
wrong
the
senators
are
men
and
god
has
given
all
feelings
and
nature
alike
the
gift
is
then
abused
thou
hast
felt
the
want
of
thy
daily
assistant
fisherman
and
thou
hast
sorrowed
for
thy
child
for
thee
it
is
easy
to
enter
into
another
griefs
but
the
senators
know
nothing
of
suffering
their
children
are
not
dragged
to
the
galleys
their
hopes
are
never
destroyed
by
laws
coming
from
hard
nor
are
their
tears
shed
for
sons
ruined
by
being
made
companions
of
the
dregs
of
the
republic
they
will
talk
of
public
virtue
and
services
to
the
state
but
in
their
own
cases
they
mean
the
virtue
of
renown
and
services
that
bring
with
them
honors
and
rewards
the
wants
of
the
state
is
their
conscience
though
they
take
heed
those
wants
shall
do
themselves
no
harm
jacopo
providence
itself
hath
made
a
difference
in
men
one
is
large
another
small
one
weak
another
strong
one
wise
another
foolish
at
what
providence
hath
done
we
should
not
murmur
providence
did
not
make
the
senate
is
an
invention
of
man
mark
me
antonio
thy
language
hath
given
offence
and
thou
art
not
safe
in
venice
they
will
pardon
all
but
complaints
against
their
justice
that
is
too
true
to
be
forgiven
can
they
wish
to
harm
one
who
seeks
his
own
child
if
thou
wert
great
and
respected
they
would
undermine
thy
fortune
and
character
ere
thou
put
their
system
in
danger
as
thou
art
weak
and
poor
they
will
do
thee
some
direct
injury
unless
thou
art
moderate
before
all
i
warn
thee
that
their
system
must
stand
will
god
suffer
this
we
may
not
enter
into
his
secrets
returned
the
bravo
devoutly
crossing
himself
did
his
reign
end
with
this
world
there
might
be
injustice
in
suffering
the
wicked
to
triumph
but
as
it
is
we
yon
boat
approaches
fast
i
little
like
its
air
and
movements
they
are
not
fishermen
truly
for
there
are
many
oars
and
a
canopy
it
is
a
gondola
of
the
state
exclaimed
jacopo
rising
and
stepping
into
his
own
boat
which
he
cast
loose
from
that
of
his
companion
when
he
stood
in
evident
doubt
as
to
his
future
proceedings
antonio
we
should
do
well
to
row
away
thy
fears
are
natural
said
the
unmoved
fisherman
and
is
a
thousand
pities
that
there
is
cause
for
them
there
is
yet
time
for
one
skilful
as
thou
to
outstrip
the
fleetest
gondola
on
the
canals
quick
lift
thy
anchor
old
man
and
depart
my
eye
is
sure
i
know
the
boat
poor
jacopo
what
a
curse
is
a
tender
conscience
thou
hast
been
kind
to
me
in
my
need
and
if
prayers
from
a
sincere
heart
can
do
thee
service
thou
shalt
not
want
them
antonio
cried
the
other
causing
his
boat
to
whirl
away
and
then
pausing
an
instant
like
a
man
undecided
i
can
stay
no
longer
trust
them
not
they
are
false
as
fiends
there
is
no
time
to
lose
i
must
away
the
fisherman
murmured
an
ejaculation
of
pity
as
he
waved
a
hand
in
adieu
holy
anthony
watch
over
my
own
child
lest
he
come
to
some
such
miserable
life
he
added
in
an
audible
prayer
there
hath
been
good
seed
cast
on
a
rock
in
that
youth
for
a
warmer
or
kinder
heart
is
not
in
man
that
one
like
jacopo
should
live
by
striking
the
blow
the
near
approach
of
the
strange
gondola
now
attracted
the
whole
attention
of
the
old
man
it
came
swiftly
towards
him
impelled
by
six
strong
oars
and
his
eye
turned
feverishly
in
the
direction
of
the
fugitive
jacopo
with
a
readiness
that
necessity
and
long
practice
rendered
nearly
instinctive
had
taken
a
direction
which
blended
his
wake
in
a
line
with
one
of
those
bright
streaks
that
the
moon
drew
on
the
water
and
which
by
dazzling
the
eye
effectually
concealed
the
objects
within
its
width
when
the
fisherman
saw
that
the
bravo
had
disappeared
he
smiled
and
seemed
at
ease
aye
let
them
come
here
he
said
it
will
give
jacopo
more
time
i
doubt
not
the
poor
fellow
hath
struck
a
blow
since
quitting
the
palace
that
the
council
will
not
forgive
the
sight
of
gold
hath
been
too
strong
and
he
hath
offended
those
who
have
so
long
borne
with
him
god
forgive
me
that
i
have
had
communion
with
such
a
man
but
when
the
heart
is
heavy
the
pity
of
even
a
dog
will
warm
our
feelings
few
care
for
me
now
or
the
friendship
of
such
as
he
could
never
have
been
welcome
antonio
ceased
for
the
gondola
of
the
state
came
with
a
rushing
noise
to
the
side
of
his
own
boat
where
it
was
suddenly
stopped
by
a
backward
sweep
of
the
oars
the
water
was
still
in
ebullition
when
a
form
passed
into
the
gondola
of
the
fisherman
the
larger
boat
shot
away
again
to
the
distance
of
a
few
hundred
feet
and
remained
at
rest
antonio
witnessed
this
movement
in
silent
curiosity
but
when
he
saw
the
gondoliers
of
the
state
lying
on
their
oars
he
glanced
his
eye
again
furtively
in
the
direction
of
jacopo
saw
that
all
was
safe
and
faced
his
companion
with
confidence
the
brightness
of
the
moon
enabled
him
to
distinguish
the
dress
and
aspect
of
a
carmelite
the
latter
seemed
more
confounded
than
his
companion
by
the
rapidity
of
the
movement
and
the
novelty
of
his
situation
notwithstanding
his
confusion
however
an
evident
look
of
wonder
crossed
his
mortified
features
when
he
first
beheld
the
humble
condition
the
thin
and
whitened
locks
and
the
general
air
and
bearing
of
the
old
man
with
whom
he
now
found
himself
who
art
thou
escaped
him
in
the
impulse
of
surprise
antonio
of
the
lamines
a
fisherman
that
owes
much
to
anthony
for
favors
little
deserved
and
why
hath
one
like
thee
fallen
beneath
the
senate
displeasure
i
am
honest
and
ready
to
do
justice
to
others
if
that
offend
the
great
they
are
men
more
to
be
pitied
than
envied
the
convicted
are
always
more
disposed
to
believe
themselves
unfortunate
than
guilty
the
error
is
fatal
and
it
should
be
eradicated
from
the
mind
lest
it
lead
to
death
go
tell
this
to
the
patricians
they
have
need
of
plain
counsel
and
a
warning
from
the
church
my
son
there
is
pride
and
anger
and
a
perverse
heart
in
thy
replies
the
sins
of
the
senators
and
as
they
are
men
they
are
not
without
spot
can
in
no
manner
whiten
thine
own
though
an
unjust
sentence
should
condemn
one
to
punishment
it
leaves
the
offences
against
god
in
their
native
deformity
men
may
pity
him
who
hath
wrongfully
undergone
the
anger
of
the
world
but
the
church
will
only
pronounce
pardon
on
him
who
confesseth
his
errors
with
a
sincere
admission
of
their
magnitude
have
you
come
father
to
shrive
a
penitent
such
is
my
errand
i
lament
the
occasion
and
if
what
i
fear
be
true
still
more
must
i
regret
that
one
so
aged
should
have
brought
his
devoted
head
beneath
the
arm
of
justice
antonio
smiled
and
again
he
bent
his
eyes
along
that
dazzling
streak
of
light
which
had
swallowed
up
the
gondola
and
the
person
of
the
bravo
father
he
said
when
a
long
and
earnest
look
was
ended
there
can
be
little
harm
in
speaking
truth
to
one
of
thy
holy
office
they
have
told
thee
there
was
a
criminal
here
in
the
lagunes
who
hath
provoked
the
anger
of
st
mark
thou
art
right
it
is
not
easy
to
know
when
mark
is
pleased
or
when
he
is
not
continued
antonio
plying
his
line
with
indifference
for
the
very
man
he
now
seeks
has
he
long
tolerated
aye
even
in
presence
of
the
doge
the
senate
hath
its
reasons
which
lie
beyond
the
reach
of
the
ignorant
but
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
soul
of
the
poor
youth
and
more
seemly
for
the
republic
had
it
turned
a
discouraging
countenance
on
his
deeds
from
the
first
thou
speakest
of
another
thou
art
not
then
the
criminal
they
seek
i
am
a
sinner
like
all
born
of
woman
reverend
carmelite
but
my
hand
hath
never
held
any
other
weapon
than
the
good
sword
with
which
i
struck
the
infidel
there
was
one
lately
here
that
i
grieve
to
add
can
not
say
this
and
he
is
gone
father
you
have
your
eyes
and
you
can
answer
that
question
for
yourself
he
is
gone
though
he
is
not
far
still
is
he
beyond
the
reach
of
the
swiftest
gondola
in
venice
praised
be
st
mark
the
carmelite
bowed
his
head
where
he
was
seated
and
his
lips
moved
either
in
prayer
or
in
thanksgiving
are
you
sorry
monk
that
a
sinner
has
escaped
son
i
rejoice
that
this
bitter
office
hath
passed
from
me
while
i
mourn
that
there
should
be
a
spirit
so
depraved
as
to
require
it
let
us
summon
the
servants
of
the
republic
and
inform
them
that
their
errand
is
useless
be
not
of
haste
good
father
the
night
is
gentle
and
these
hirelings
sleep
on
their
oars
like
gulls
in
the
lagunes
the
youth
will
have
more
time
for
repentance
should
he
be
undisturbed
the
carmelite
who
had
risen
instantly
reseated
himself
like
one
actuated
by
a
strong
impulse
i
thought
he
had
already
been
far
beyond
pursuit
he
muttered
unconsciously
apologizing
for
his
apparent
haste
he
is
over
bold
and
i
fear
he
will
row
back
to
the
canals
in
which
case
you
might
meet
nearer
to
the
city
or
there
may
be
more
gondolas
of
the
state
out
in
short
father
thou
wilt
be
more
certain
to
escape
hearing
the
confession
of
a
bravo
by
listening
to
that
of
a
fisherman
who
has
long
wanted
an
occasion
to
acknowledge
his
sins
men
who
ardently
wish
the
same
result
require
few
words
to
understand
each
other
the
carmelite
took
intuitively
the
meaning
of
his
companion
and
throwing
back
his
cowl
a
movement
that
exposed
the
countenance
of
father
anselmo
he
prepared
to
listen
to
the
confession
of
the
old
man
thou
art
a
christian
and
one
of
thy
years
hath
not
to
learn
the
state
of
mind
that
becometh
a
penitent
said
the
monk
when
each
was
ready
i
am
a
sinner
father
give
me
counsel
and
absolution
that
i
may
have
hope
thy
will
be
done
thy
prayer
is
heard

and
kneel
antonio
who
had
fastened
his
line
to
his
seat
and
disposed
of
his
net
with
habitual
care
now
crossed
himself
devoutly
and
took
his
station
before
the
carmelite
his
acknowledgments
of
error
then
began
much
mental
misery
clothed
the
language
and
ideas
of
the
fisherman
with
a
dignity
that
his
auditor
had
not
been
accustomed
to
find
in
men
of
his
class
a
spirit
so
long
chastened
by
suffering
had
become
elevated
and
noble
he
related
his
hopes
for
the
boy
the
manner
in
which
they
had
been
blasted
by
the
unjust
and
selfish
policy
of
the
state
his
different
efforts
to
procure
the
release
of
his
grandson
and
his
bold
expedients
at
the
regatta
and
the
fancied
nuptials
with
the
adriatic
when
he
had
thus
prepared
the
carmelite
to
understand
the
origin
of
his
sinful
passions
which
it
was
now
his
duty
to
expose
he
spoke
of
those
passions
themselves
and
of
their
influence
on
a
mind
that
was
ordinarily
at
peace
with
mankind
the
tale
was
told
simply
and
without
reserve
but
in
a
manner
to
inspire
respect
and
to
awaken
powerful
sympathy
in
him
who
heard
it
and
these
feelings
thou
didst
indulge
against
the
honored
and
powerful
of
venice
demanded
the
monk
affecting
a
severity
he
could
not
feel
before
my
god
do
i
confess
the
sin
in
bitterness
of
heart
i
cursed
them
for
to
me
they
seemed
men
without
feeling
for
the
poor
and
heartless
as
the
marbles
of
their
own
palaces
thou
knowest
that
to
be
forgiven
thou
must
forgive
dost
thou
at
peace
with
all
of
earth
forget
this
wrong
and
thou
in
charity
with
thy
fellows
pray
to
him
who
died
for
the
race
in
behalf
of
those
who
have
injured
thee
antonio
bowed
his
head
on
his
naked
breast
and
he
seemed
to
commune
with
his
soul
father
he
said
in
a
rebuked
tone
i
hope
i
do
thou
must
not
trifle
with
thyself
to
thine
own
perdition
there
is
an
eye
in
yon
vault
above
us
which
pervades
space
and
which
looks
into
the
inmost
secrets
of
the
heart
thou
pardon
the
error
of
the
patricians
in
a
contrite
spirit
for
thine
own
sins
holy
maria
pray
for
them
as
i
now
ask
mercy
in
their
behalf
father
they
are
forgiven
amen
the
carmelite
arose
and
stood
over
the
kneeling
antonio
with
the
whole
of
his
benevolent
countenance
illuminated
by
the
moon
stretching
his
arms
towards
the
stars
he
pronounced
the
absolution
in
a
voice
that
was
touched
with
pious
fervor
the
upward
expectant
eye
with
the
withered
lineaments
of
the
fisherman
and
the
holy
calm
of
the
monk
formed
a
picture
of
resignation
and
hope
that
angels
would
have
loved
to
witness
amen
amen
exclaimed
antonio
as
he
arose
crossing
himself
anthony
and
the
virgin
aid
me
to
keep
these
resolutions
i
will
not
forget
thee
my
son
in
the
offices
of
holy
church
receive
my
benediction
that
i
may
depart
antonio
again
bowed
his
knee
while
the
carmelite
firmly
pronounced
the
words
of
peace
when
this
last
office
was
performed
and
a
decent
interval
of
mutual
but
silent
prayer
had
passed
a
signal
was
given
to
summon
the
gondola
of
the
state
it
came
rowing
down
with
great
force
and
was
instantly
at
their
side
two
men
passed
into
the
boat
of
antonio
and
with
officious
zeal
assisted
the
monk
to
resume
his
place
in
that
of
the
republic

the
penitent
shrived
half
whispered

seemingly
the
superior
of
the
two
here
is
an
error
he
thou
has
escaped
this
aged
man
is
a
fisherman
named
antonio
and
one
who
can
not
have
gravely
offended

hath
passed
towards
the
island
of
san
giorgio
and
must
be
sought

the
officer
released
the
person
of
the
monk
who
passed
quickly
beneath
the
canopy
and
he
turned
to
cast
a
hasty
glance
at
the
features
of
the
fisherman
the
rubbing
of
a
rope
was
audible
and
the
anchor
of
antonio
was
lifted
by
a
sudden
jerk
a
heavy
plashing
of
the
water
followed
and
the
two
boats
shot
away
together
obedient
to
a
violent
effort
of
the
crew
the
gondola
of
the
state
exhibited
its
usual
number
of
gondoliers
bending
to
their
toil
with
its
dark
and
canopy
but
that
of
the
fisherman
was
empty
the
sweep
of
the
oars
and
the
plunge
of
the
body
of
antonio
had
been
blended
in
a
common
wash
of
the
surge
when
the
fisherman
came
to
the
surface
after
his
fall
he
was
alone
in
the
centre
of
the
vast
but
tranquil
sheet
of
water
there
might
have
been
a
glimmering
of
hope
as
he
arose
from
the
darkness
of
the
sea
to
the
bright
beauty
of
that
moonlit
night
but
the
sleeping
domes
were
too
far
for
human
strength
and
the
gondolas
were
sweeping
madly
towards
the
town
he
turned
and
swimming
feebly
for
hunger
and
previous
exertion
had
undermined
his
strength
he
bent
his
eye
on
the
dark
spot
which
he
had
constantly
recognised
as
the
boat
of
the
bravo
jacopo
had
not
ceased
to
watch
the
interview
with
the
utmost
intentness
of
his
faculties
favored
by
position
he
could
see
without
being
distinctly
visible
he
saw
the
carmelite
pronouncing
the
absolution
and
he
witnessed
the
approach
of
the
larger
boat
he
heard
a
plunge
heavier
than
that
of
falling
oars
and
he
saw
the
gondola
of
antonio
towing
away
empty
the
crew
of
the
republic
had
scarcely
swept
the
lagunes
with
their
before
his

jacopo
jacopo
came
fearfully
and
faintly
to
his
ears
the
voice
was
known
and
the
occasion
thoroughly
understood
the
cry
of
distress
was
succeeded
by
the
rush
of
the
water
as
it
piled
before
the
beak
of
the
bravo
gondola
the
sound
of
the
parted
element
was
like
the
sighing
of
a
breeze
ripples
and
bubbles
were
left
behind
as
the
driven
scud
floats
past
the
stars
and
all
those
muscles
which
had
once
before
that
day
been
so
finely
developed
in
the
race
of
the
gondoliers
were
now
expanded
seemingly
in
twofold
volumes
energy
and
skill
were
in
every
stroke
and
the
dark
spot
came
down
the
streak
of
light
like
the
swallow
touching
the
water
with
its
wing
hither
jacopo
thou
steerest
wide
the
beak
of
the
gondola
turned
and
the
glaring
eye
of
the
bravo
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
fisherman
head
quickly
good
jacopo
i
fail
the
murmuring
of
the
water
again
drowned
the
stifled
words
the
efforts
of
the
oar
were
frenzied
and
at
each
stroke
the
light
gondola
appeared
to
rise
from
its
element
jacopo

the

the

the

gurgled
an

was
visible
in
the
air
and
it
disappeared
the
gondola
drove
upon
the
spot
where
the
limb
had
just
been
visible
and
a
backward
stroke
that
caused
the
ashen
blade
to
bend
like
a
reed
laid
the
trembling
boat
motionless
the
furious
action
threw
the
lagune
into
ebullition
but
when
the
foam
subsided
it
lay
calm
as
the
blue
and
peaceful
vault
it
reflected
antonio
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
bravo
a
frightful
silence
succeeded
the
call
there
was
neither
answer
nor
human
form
jacopo
compressed
the
handle
of
his
oar
with
fingers
of
iron
and
his
own
breathing
caused
him
to
start
on
every
side
he
bent
a
frenzied
eye
and
on
every
side
he
beheld
the
profound
repose
of
that
treacherous
element
which
is
so
terrible
in
its
wrath
like
the
human
heart
it
seemed
to
sympathize
with
the
tranquil
beauty
of
the
midnight
view
but
like
the
human
heart
it
kept
its
own
fearful
secrets

a

and
i
shall

where
no

my
angiolina
marino
faliero
when
the
carmelite
the
apartment
of
donna
violetta
his
face
was
covered
with
the
hue
of
death
and
his
limbs
with
difficulty
supported
him
to
a
chair
he
scarcely
observed
that
don
camillo
monforte
was
still
present
nor
did
he
note
the
brightness
and
joy
which
glowed
in
the
eyes
of
the
ardent
violetta
indeed
his
appearance
was
at
first
unseen
by
the
happy
lovers
for
the
lord
of
agata
had
succeeded
in
wresting
the
secret
from
the
breast
of
his
mistress
if
that
may
be
called
a
secret
which
italian
character
had
scarcely
struggled
to
retain
and
he
had
crossed
the
room
before
even
the
more
tranquil
look
of
the
donna
florinda
rested
on
his
person
thou
art
ill
exclaimed
the
governess
father
anselmo
hath
not
been
absent
without
grave
cause
the
monk
threw
back
his
cowl
for
air
and
the
act
discovered
the
deadly
paleness
of
his
features
but
his
eye
charged
with
a
meaning
of
horror
rolled
over
the
faces
of
those
who
drew
around
him
as
if
he
struggled
with
memory
to
recall
their
persons

the

thou

hast
thou

in
a
moment
of
so
much
importance
to
our

a
moment
that
may
prove
of
the
last
influence
on

happiness
hast
thou
been
absent
for
a
long
hour
violetta
turned
a
surprised
and
unconscious
glance
towards
the
clock
but
she
spoke
not
the
servants
of
the
state
had
need
of
me
returned
the
monk
easing
the
pain
of
his
spirit
by
a
groan
i
understand
thee
father
thou
hast
shrived
a
penitent
daughter
i
have
and
few
depart
more
at
peace
with
god
and
their
fellows
donna
florinda
murmured
a
short
prayer
for
the
soul
of
the
dead
piously
crossing
herself
as
she
concluded
her
example
was
imitated
by
her
pupil
and
even
the
lips
of
don
camillo
moved
while
his
head
was
bowed
by
the
side
of
his
fair
companion
in
seeming
reverence
was
a
just
end
father
demanded
donna
florinda
it
was
an
unmerited
one
cried
the
monk
with
fervor
or
there
is
no
faith
in
man
i
have
witnessed
the
death
of
one
who
was
better
fitted
to
live
as
happily
he
was
better
fitted
to
die
than
those
who
pronounced
his
doom
what
a
fearful
state
is
venice
and
such
are
they
who
are
masters
of
thy
person
violetta
said
don
camillo
to
these
midnight
murderers
will
thy
happiness
be
consigned
tell
us
father
does
thy
sad
tragedy
touch
in
any
manner
on
the
interests
of
this
fair
being
for
we
are
encircled
here
by
mysteries
that
are
as
incomprehensible
while
they
are
nearly
as
fearful
as
fate
itself
the
monk
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
a
more
human
expression
began
to
appear
in
his
countenance
thou
art
right
he
said
such
are
the
men
who
mean
to
dispose
of
the
person
of
our
pupil
holy
mark
pardon
the
prostitution
of
his
revered
name
and
shield
her
with
the
virtue
of
his
prayers
father
are
we
worthy
to
know
more
of
that
thou
hast
witnessed
the
secrets
of
the
confessional
are
sacred
my
son
but
this
hath
been
a
disclosure
to
cover
the
living
not
the
dead
with
shame
i
see
the
hand
of
those
up
above
in
this
for
so
most
spoke
of
the
council
of
three
they
have
tampered
with
my
right
for
years
to
suit
their
selfish
purposes
and
to
my
shame
must
i
own
it
they
have
driven
me
to
a
submission
in
order
to
obtain
justice
that
as
ill
accords
with
my
feelings
as
with
my
character
nay
camillo
thou
art
incapable
of
this
injustice
to
thyself
is
a
fearful
government
dearest
and
its
fruits
are
equally
pernicious
to
the
ruler
and
the
subject
it
hath
of
all
other
dangers
the
greatest
the
curse
of
secresy
on
its
intentions
its
acts
and
its
responsibilities
thou
sayest
true
my
son
there
is
no
security
against
oppression
and
wrong
in
a
state
but
the
fear
of
god
or
the
fear
of
man
of
the
first
venice
hath
none
for
too
many
souls
share
the
odium
of
her
sins
and
as
for
the
last
her
deeds
are
hid
from
their
knowledge
we
speak
boldly
for
those
who
live
beneath
her
laws
observed
donna
florinda
glancing
a
look
timidly
around
her
as
we
can
neither
change
nor
mend
the
practices
of
the
state
better
that
we
should
be
silent
if
we
can
not
alter
the
power
of
the
council
we
may
elude
it
hastily
answered
don
camillo
though
he
too
dropped
his
voice
and
assured
himself
of
their
security
by
closing
the
casement
and
casting
his
eyes
towards
the
different
doors
of
the
room
are
you
assured
of
the
fidelity
of
the
menials
donna
florinda
far
from
it
signore
we
have
those
who
are
of
ancient
service
and
of
tried
character
but
we
have
those
who
are
named
by
the
senator
gradenigo
and
who
are
doubtless
no
other
than
the
agents
of
the
state
in
this
manner
do
they
pry
into
the
privacy
of
all
i
am
compelled
to
entertain
in
my
palace
varlets
that
i
know
to
be
their
hirelings
and
yet
do
i
find
it
better
to
seem
unconscious
of
their
views
lest
they
environ
me
in
a
manner
that
i
can
not
even
suspect
think
you
father
that
my
presence
here
hath
escaped
the
spies
it
would
be
to
hazard
much
were
we
to
rely
on
such
security
none
saw
us
enter
as
i
think
for
we
used
the
secret
gate
and
the
more
private
entrance
but
who
is
certain
of
being
unobserved
when
every
fifth
eye
is
that
of
a
mercenary
the
terrified
violetta
laid
her
hand
on
the
arm
of
her
lover
even
now
camillo
she
said
thou
mayest
be
observed
and
secretly
devoted
to
punishment
if
seen
doubt
it
not
mark
will
never
pardon
so
bold
an
interference
with
his
pleasure
and
yet
sweetest
violetta
to
gain
thy
favor
this
risk
is
nothing
nor
will
a
far
greater
hazard
turn
me
from
my
purpose
these
inexperienced
and
confiding
spirits
have
taken
advantage
of
my
absence
to
communicate
more
freely
than
was
discreet
said
the
carmelite
in
the
manner
of
one
who
foresaw
the
answer
father
nature
is
too
strong
for
the
weak
preventives
of
prudence
the
brow
of
the
monk
became
clouded
his
companions
watched
the
workings
of
his
mind
as
they
appeared
in
a
countenance
that
in
common
was
so
benevolent
though
always
sad
for
a
few
moments
none
broke
the
silence
the
carmelite
at
length
demanded
raising
his
troubled
look
to
the
countenance
of
don
camillo
hast
thou
duly
reflected
on
the
consequences
of
this
rashness
son
what
dost
thou
purpose
in
thus
braving
the
anger
of
the
republic
and
in
setting
at
defiance
her
arts
her
secret
means
of
intelligence
and
her
terrors
father
i
have
reflected
as
all
of
my
years
reflect
when
in
heart
and
soul
they
love
i
have
brought
myself
to
feel
that
any
misery
would
be
happiness
compared
to
the
loss
of
violetta
and
that
no
risk
can
exceed
the
reward
of
gaining
her
favor
thus
much
for
the
first
of
thy
questions
for
the
last
i
can
only
say
that
i
am
too
much
accustomed
to
the
wiles
of
the
senate
to
be
a
novice
in
the
means
of
counteracting
them
there
is
but
one
language
for
youth
when
seduced
by
that
pleasing
delusion
which
paints
the
future
with
hues
of
gold
age
and
experience
may
condemn
it
but
the
weakness
will
continue
to
prevail
in

life
shall
appear
in
its
true
colors
duke
of
sant
agata
though
a
noble
of
high
lineage
and
illustrious
name
and
though
lord
of
many
vassals
thou
art
not
a
power
thou
not
declare
thy
palace
in
venice
a
fortress
nor
send
a
herald
to
the
doge
with
defiance
true
reverend
monk
i
can
not
do
this
nor
would
it
be
well
for
him
who
could
to
trust
his
fortune
on
so
reckless
a
risk
but
the
states
of
mark
do
not
cover
the
earth
we
can
fly
the
senate
hath
a
long
arm
and
it
hath
a
thousand
secret
hands
none
know
it
better
than
i
still
it
does
no
violence
without
motive
the
faith
of
their
ward
irretrievably
mine
the
evil
as
respects
them
becomes
irreparable
thou
so
means
would
quickly
be
found
to
separate
you
believe
not
that
venice
would
be
thwarted
of
its
design
so
easily
the
wealth
of
a
house
like
this
would
purchase
many
an
unworthy
suitor
and
thy
right
would
be
disregarded
or
haply
denied
but
father
the
ceremony
of
the
church
may
not
be
despised
exclaimed
violetta
it
comes
from
heaven
and
is
sacred
daughter
i
say
it
with
sorrow
but
the
great
and
the
powerful
find
means
even
to
set
aside
that
venerable
and
holy
sacrament
thine
own
gold
would
serve
to
seal
thy
misery
this
might
arrive
father
were
we
to
continue
within
the
grasp
of
mark
interrupted
the
neapolitan
but
once
beyond
his
borders
be
a
bold
interference
with
the
right
of
a
foreign
state
to
lay
hands
on
our
persons
more
than
this
i
have
a
castle
in
agata
that
will
defy
their
most
secret
means
until
events
might
happen
which
should
render
it
more
prudent
for
them
to
desist
than
to
persevere
this
reason
hath
force
wert
thou
within
the
walls
of
agata
instead
of
being
as
thou
art
among
the
canals
here
is
one
of
calabria
a
vassal
born
of
mine
a
certain
stefano
milano
the
padrone
of
a
sorrentine
felucca
now
lying
in
the
port
the
man
is
in
strict
amity
with
my
own
gondolier
he
who
was
third
in
this
day
race
art
thou
ill
father
that
thou
appearest
troubled
proceed
with
thy
expedient
answered
the
monk
motioning
that
he
wished
not
to
be
observed
my
faithful
gino
reports
that
this
stefano
is
on
the
canals
on
some
errand
of
the
republic
as
he
thinks
for
though
the
mariner
is
less
disposed
to
familiarity
than
is
wont
he
hath
let
drop
hints
that
lead
to
such
a
conclusion
the
felucca
is
ready
from
hour
to
hour
to
put
to
sea
and
doubt
not
that
the
padrone
would
rather
serve
his
natural
lord
than
these
miscreants
of
the
senate
i
can
pay
as
well
as
they
if
served
to
my
pleasure
and
i
can
punish
too
when
offended
there
is
reason
in
this
signore
wert
thou
beyond
the
wiles
of
this
mysterious
city
but
in
what
manner
thou
embark
without
drawing
the
notice
of
those
who
doubtless
watch
our
movements
on
thy
person
there
are
maskers
on
the
canals
at
all
hours
and
if
venice
be
so
impertinent
in
her
system
of
watchfulness
thou
knowest
father
that
without
extraordinary
motive
that
disguise
is
sacred
without
this
narrow
privilege
the
town
would
not
be
habitable
a
day
i
fear
the
result
observed
the
hesitating
monk
while
it
was
evident
from
the
thoughtfulness
of
his
countenance
that
he
calculated
the
chances
of
the
adventure
if
known
and
arrested
we
are
all
lost
trust
me
father
that
thy
fortune
shall
not
be
forgotten
even
in
that
unhappy
issue
i
have
an
uncle
as
you
know
high
in
the
favor
of
the
pontiff
and
who
wears
the
scarlet
hat
i
pledge
to
you
the
honor
of
a
cavalier
all
my
interest
with
this
relative
to
gain
such
intercession
from
the
church
as
shall
weaken
the
blow
to
her
servant
the
features
of
the
carmelite
flushed
and
for
the
first
time
the
ardent
young
noble
observed
around
his
ascetic
mouth
an
expression
of
worldly
pride
thou
hast
unjustly
rated
my
apprehensions
lord
of
agata
he
said
i
fear
not
for
myself
but
for
others
this
tender
and
lovely
child
hath
not
been
confided
to
my
care
without
creating
a
parental
solicitude
in
her
behalf
and
he
paused
and
seemed
to
struggle
with
himself
i
have
too
long
known
the
mild
and
womanly
virtues
of
donna
florinda
to
witness
with
indifference
her
exposure
to
a
near
and
fearful
danger
abandon
our
charge
we
can
not
nor
do
i
see
in
what
manner
as
prudent
and
watchful
guardians
we
may
in
any
manner
consent
to
this
risk
let
us
hope
that
they
who
govern
will
yet
consult
the
honor
and
happiness
of
donna
violetta
that
were
to
hope
the
winged
lion
would
become
a
lamb
or
the
dark
and
soulless
senate
a
community
of
and
godly
carthusians
no
reverend
monk
we
must
seize
the
happy
moment
and
none
is
likely
to
be
more
fortunate
than
this
or
trust
our
hopes
to
a
cold
and
calculating
policy
that
disregards
all
motives
but
its
own
object
an
hour
nay
half
the
time
would
suffice
to
apprise
the
mariner
and
ere
the
morning
light
we
might
see
the
domes
of
venice
sinking
into
their
own
hated
lagunes
these
are
the
plans
of
confident
youth
quickened
by
passion
believe
me
son
it
is
not
easy
as
thou
imaginest
to
mislead
the
agents
of
the
police
this
palace
could
not
be
quitted
the
felucca
entered
or
any
one
of
the
many
necessary
steps
hazarded
without
drawing
upon
us
their
eyes
hark
i
hear
the
wash
of
oars
a
gondola
is
even
now
at
the
donna
florinda
went
hastily
to
the
balcony
and
as
quickly
returned
to
report
that
she
had
seen
an
officer
of
the
republic
enter
the
palace
there
was
no
time
to
lose
and
don
camillo
was
again
urged
to
conceal
himself
in
the
little
oratory
this
necessary
caution
had
hardly
been
observed
before
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
the
privileged
messenger
of
the
senate
announced
his
own
appearance
it
was
the
very
individual
who
had
presided
at
the
fearful
execution
of
the
fisherman
and
who
had
already
announced
the
cessation
of
the
signor
powers
his
eye
glanced
suspiciously
around
the
room
as
he
entered
and
the
carmelite
trembled
in
every
limb
at
the
look
which
encountered
his
own
but
all
immediate
apprehensions
vanished
when
the
usual
artful
smile
with
which
he
was
wont
to
soften
his
disagreeable
communications
took
place
of
the
momentary
expression
of
a
vague
and
habitual
suspicion
noble
lady
he
said
bowing
with
deference
to
the
rank
of
her
he
addressed
you
may
learn
by
this
assiduity
on
the
part
of
their
servant
the
interest
which
the
senate
takes
in
your
welfare
anxious
to
do
you
pleasure
and
ever
attentive
to
the
wishes
of
one
so
young
it
hath
been
decided
to
give
you
the
amusement
and
variety
of
another
scene
at
a
season
when
the
canals
of
our
city
become
disagreeable
from
their
warmth
and
the
crowds
which
live
in
the
air
i
am
sent
to
request
you
will
make
such
preparations
as
may
befit
your
convenience
during
a
few
months
residence
in
a
purer
atmosphere
and
that
this
may
be
done
speedily
as
your
journey
always
to
prevent
discomfort
to
yourself
will
commence
before
the
rising
of
the
sun
this
is
short
notice
signore
for
a
female
about
to
quit
the
dwelling
of
her
ancestors
mark
suffers
his
love
and
parental
care
to
overlook
the
vain
ceremonies
of
form
it
is
thus
the
parent
dealeth
with
the
child
there
is
little
need
of
unusual
notice
since
it
will
be
the
business
of
the
government
to
see
all
that
is
necessary
dispatched
to
the
residence
which
is
to
be
honored
with
the
presence
of
so
illustrious
a
lady
for
myself
signore
little
preparation
is
needed
but
i
fear
the
train
of
servitors
that
befit
my
condition
will
require
more
leisure
for
their
arrangements
lady
that
embarrassment
hath
been
foreseen
and
to
remove
it
the
council
hath
decided
to
supply
you
with
the
only
attendant
you
will
require
during
an
absence
from
the
city
which
will
be
so
short
how
signore
am
i
to
be
separated
from
my
people
from
the
hired
menials
of
your
palace
lady
to
be
confided
to
those
who
will
serve
your
person
from
a
nobler
motive
and
my
maternal
friend
my
ghostly
adviser
they
will
be
permitted
to
repose
from
their
trusts
during
your
absence
an
exclamation
from
donna
florinda
and
an
involuntary
movement
of
the
monk
betrayed
their
mutual
concern
donna
violetta
suppressed
the
exhibition
of
her
own
resentment
and
of
her
wounded
affections
by
a
powerful
effort
in
which
she
was
greatly
sustained
by
her
pride
but
she
could
not
entirely
conceal
the
anguish
of
another
sort
that
was
seated
in
her
eye
do
i
understand
that
this
prohibition
extends
to
her
who
in
common
serves
my
person
signora
such
are
my
instructions
is
it
expected
that
violetta
tiepolo
will
do
these
menial
offices
for
herself
signora
no
a
most
excellent
and
agreeable
attendant
has
been
provided
for
that
duty
annina
he
continued
approaching
the
door
thy
noble
mistress
is
impatient
to
see
thee
as
he
spoke
the
daughter
of
the
appeared
she
wore
an
air
of
assumed
humility
but
it
was
accompanied
by
a
secret
mien
that
betrayed
independence
of
the
pleasure
of
her
new
mistress
and
this
damsel
is
to
be
my
nearest
confidante
exclaimed
donna
yioletta
after
studying
the
artful
and
demure
countenance
of
the
girl
a
moment
with
a
dislike
she
did
not
care
to
conceal
such
hath
been
the
solicitude
of
your
illustrious
guardians
lady
as
the
damsel
is
instructed
in
all
that
is
necessary
i
will
intrude
no
longer
but
take
my
leave
recommending
that
you
improve
the
hours
which
are
now
few
between
this
and
the
rising
sun
that
you
may
profit
by
the
morning
breeze
in
quitting
the
city
the
officer
glanced
another
look
around
the
room
more
however
through
habitual
caution
than
any
other
reason
bowed
and
departed
a
profound
and
sorrowful
silence
succeeded
then
the
apprehension
that
don
camillo
might
mistake
their
situation
and
appear
flashed
upon
the
mind
of
violetta
and
she
hastened
to
apprise
him
of
the
danger
by
speaking
to
the
new
attendant
thou
hast
served
before
this
annina
she
asked
so
loud
as
to
permit
the
words
to
be
heard
in
the
oratory
never
a
lady
so
beautiful
and
illustrious
signora
but
i
hope
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
one
that
i
hear
is
kind
to
all
around
her
thou
art
not
new
to
the
flattery
of
thy
class
go
then
and
acquaint
my
ancient
attendants
with
this
sudden
resolution
that
i
may
not
disappoint
the
council
by
tardiness
i
commit
all
to
thy
care
annina
since
thou
knowest
the
pleasure
of
my
guardians
those
without
will
furnish
the
means
the
girl
lingered
and
her
watchful
observers
noted
suspicion
and
hesitation
in
her
reluctant
manner
of
compliance
she
obeyed
however
leaving
the
room
with
the
domestic
donna
violetta
summoned
from
the
antechamber
the
instant
the
door
was
closed
behind
her
don
camillo
was
in
the
group
and
the
whole
four
stood
regarding
each
other
in
a
common
panic
canst
thou
still
hesitate
father
demanded
the
lover
not
a
moment
my
son
did
i
see
the
means
of
accomplishing
flight
how
thou
wilt
not
then
desert
me
exclaimed
violetta
kissing
his
hands
in
joy
nor
thou
my
second
mother
neither
answered
the
governess
who
possessed
intuitive
means
of
comprehending
the
resolutions
of
the
monk
we
will
go
with
thee
love
to
the
castle
of
agata
or
to
the
dungeon
of
st
mark
virtuous
and
sainted
florinda
receive
my
thanks
cried
the
reprieved
violetta
clasping
her
hands
on
her
bosom
with
an
emotion
in
which
piety
and
gratitude
were
mingled
camillo
we
await
thy
guidance
refrain
observed
the
monk
a
footstep
thy
concealment
don
camillo
was
scarce
hid
from
view
when
annina
reappeared
she
had
the
same
suspicious
manner
of
glancing
her
eye
around
as
the
official
and
it
would
seem
by
the
idle
question
she
put
that
her
entrance
had
some
other
object
than
the
mere
pretence
which
she
made
of
consulting
her
new
mistress
humor
in
the
color
of
a
robe
do
as
thou
wilt
girl
said
violetta
with
impatience
thou
knowest
the
place
of
my
intended
retirement
and
judge
of
the
fitness
of
my
attire
hasten
thy
preparations
that
i
be
not
the
cause
of
delay
enrico
attend
my
new
maid
to
the
wardrobe
annina
reluctantly
withdrew
for
she
was
far
too
much
practised
in
wiles
not
to
distrust
this
unexpected
compliance
with
the
will
of
the
council
or
not
to
perceive
that
she
was
admitted
with
displeasure
to
the
discharge
of
her
new
duties
as
the
faithful
domestic
of
donna
violetta
kept
at
her
side
she
was
fain
however
to
submit
and
suffered
herself
to
be
led
a
few
steps
from
the
door
suddenly
pretending
to
recollect
a
new
question
she
returned
with
so
much
rapidity
as
to
be
again
in
the
room
before
enrico
could
anticipate
the
intention
daughter
complete
thy
errands
and
forbear
to
interrupt
our
privacy
said
the
monk
sternly
i
am
about
to
confess
this
penitent
who
may
pine
long
for
the
consolations
of
the
holy
office
ere
we
meet
again
if
thou
hast
not
aught
urgent
withdraw
ere
thou
seriously
givest
offence
to
the
church
the
severity
of
the
carmelite
tone
and
the
commanding
though
subdued
gleaming
of
his
eye
had
the
effect
to
awe
the
girl
quailing
before
his
look
and
in
truth
startled
at
the
risk
she
ran
in
offending
against
opinions
so
deeply
seated
in
the
minds
of
all
and
from
which
her
own
superstitious
habits
were
far
from
free
she
muttered
a
few
words
of
apology
and
finally
withdrew
there
was
another
uneasy
and
suspicious
glance
thrown
around
her
however
before
the
door
was
closed
when
they
were
once
more
alone
the
monk
motioned
for
silence
to
the
impetuous
don
camillo
who
could
scarce
restrain
his
impatience
until
the
intruder
departed
son
be
prudent
he
said
we
are
in
the
midst
of
treachery
in
this
unhappy
city
none
know
in
whom
they
can
confide
i
think
we
are
sure
of
enrico
said
the
donna
florinda
though
the
very
doubts
she
affected
not
to
feel
lingered
in
the
tones
of
her
voice
it
matters
not
daughter
he
is
ignorant
of
the
presence
of
don
camillo
and
in
that
we
are
safe
duke
of
sant
agata
if
you
can
deliver
us
from
these
toils
we
will
accompany
you
a
cry
of
joy
was
near
bursting
from
the
lips
of
violetta
but
obedient
to
the
eye
of
the
monk
she
turned
to
her
lover
as
if
to
learn
his
decision
the
expression
of
don
camillo
face
was
the
pledge
of
his
assent
without
speaking
he
wrote
hastily
with
a
pencil
a
few
words
on
the
envelope
of
a
letter
and
inclosing
a
piece
of
coin
in
its
folds
he
moved
with
a
cautious
step
to
the
balcony
a
signal
was
given
and
all
awaited
in
breathless
silence
the
answer
presently
they
heard
the
wash
of
the
water
caused
by
the
movement
of
a
gondola
beneath
the
window
stepping
forward
again
don
camillo
dropped
the
paper
with
such
precision
that
he
distinctly
heard
the
fall
of
the
coin
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
gondolier
scarce
raised
his
eyes
to
the
balcony
but
commencing
an
air
much
used
on
the
canals
he
swept
onward
like
one
whose
duty
called
for
no
haste
that
has
succeeded
said
don
camillo
when
he
heard
the
song
of
gino
in
an
hour
my
agent
will
have
secured
the
felucca
and
all
now
depends
on
our
own
means
of
quitting
the
palace
unobserved
my
people
will
await
us
shortly
and
perhaps
be
well
to
trust
openly
to
our
speed
in
gaining
the
adriatic
there
is
a
solemn
and
necessary
duty
to
perform
observed
the
monk
daughters
withdraw
to
your
rooms
and
occupy
yourselves
with
the
preparation
necessary
for
your
flight
which
may
readily
be
made
to
appear
as
intended
to
meet
the
senate
pleasure
in
a
few
minutes
i
shall
summon
you
hither
again
wondering
but
obedient
the
females
withdrew
the
carmelite
then
made
a
brief
but
clear
explanation
of
his
intention
don
camillo
listened
eagerly
and
when
the
other
had
done
speaking
they
retired
together
into
the
oratory
fifteen
minutes
had
not
passed
before
the
monk
reappeared
alone
and
touched
the
bell
which
communicated
with
the
closet
of
violetta
donna
florinda
and
her
pupil
were
quickly
in
the
room
prepare
thy
mind
for
the
confessional
said
the
priest
placing
himself
with
grave
dignity
in
that
chair
which
he
habitually
used
when
listening
to
the
and
failings
of
his
spiritual
child
the
brow
of
violetta
paled
and
flushed
again
as
if
there
lay
a
heavy
sin
on
her
conscience
she
turned
an
imploring
look
on
her
maternal
monitor
in
whose
mild
features
she
met
an
encouraging
smile
and
then
with
a
beating
heart
though
for
the
solemn
duty
but
with
a
decision
that
the
occasion
required
she
knelt
on
the
cushion
at
the
feet
of
the
monk
the
murmured
language
of
donna
violetta
was
audible
to
none
but
him
for
whose
paternal
ear
it
was
intended
and
that
dread
being
whose
just
anger
it
was
hoped
it
might
lessen
but
don
camillo
gazed
through
the
door
of
the
chapel
on
the
kneeling
form
the
clasped
hands
and
the
uplifted
countenance
of
the
beautiful
penitent
as
she
proceeded
with
the
acknowledgment
of
her
errors
the
flush
on
her
cheek
deepened
and
a
pious
excitement
kindled
in
those
eyes
which
he
had
so
lately
seen
glowing
with
a
very
different
passion
the
ingenuous
and
disciplined
soul
of
violetta
was
not
so
quickly
disburdened
of
its
load
of
sin
as
that
of
the
more
practised
mind
of
the
lord
of
sant
agata
the
latter
fancied
that
he
could
trace
in
the
movement
of
her
lips
the
sound
of
his
own
name
and
a
dozen
times
during
the
confession
he
thought
he
could
even
comprehend
sentences
of
which
he
himself
was
the
subject
twice
the
good
father
smiled
involuntarily
and
at
each
indiscretion
he
laid
a
hand
in
affection
on
the
bared
head
of
the
suppliant
but
violetta
ceased
to
speak
and
the
absolution
was
pronounced
with
a
fervor
that
the
remarkable
circumstances
in
which
they
all
stood
did
not
fail
to
heighten
when
this
portion
of
his
duty
was
ended
the
carmelite
entered
the
oratory
with
steady
hands
he
lighted
the
candles
of
the
altar
and
made
the
other
dispositions
for
the
mass
during
this
interval
don
camillo
was
at
the
side
of
his
mistress
whispering
with
the
warmth
of
a
triumphant
and
happy
lover
the
governess
stood
near
the
door
watching
for
the
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
antechamber
the
monk
then
advanced
to
the
entrance
of
the
little
chapel
and
was
about
to
speak
when
a
hurried
step
from
donna
florinda
arrested
his
words
don
camillo
had
just
time
to
conceal
his
person
within
the
drapery
of
a
window
before
the
door
opened
and
annina
entered
when
the
preparations
of
the
altar
and
the
solemn
countenance
of
the
priest
first
met
her
eye
the
girl
recoiled
with
the
air
of
one
rebuked
but
rallying
her
thoughts
with
that
readiness
which
had
gained
her
the
employment
she
filled
she
crossed
herself
reverently
and
took
a
place
apart
like
one
who
while
she
knew
her
station
wished
to
participate
in
the
mysteries
of
the
holy
office
daughter
none
who
commence
this
mass
with
us
can
quit
the
presence
ere
it
be
completed
observed
the
monk
father
it
is
my
duty
to
be
near
the
person
of
my
mistress
and
it
is
a
happiness
to
be
near
it
on
the
occasion
of
this
early
matin
the
monk
was
embarrassed
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
indecision
and
was
about
to
frame
some
pretence
to
get
rid
of
the
intruder
when
don
cainillo
appeared
in
the
middle
of
the
room
reverend
monk
proceed
he
said
is
but
another
witness
of
my
happiness
while
speaking
the
noble
touched
the
handle
of
his
sword
significantly
with
a
finger
and
cast
a
look
at
the
half
petrified
annina
which
effectually
controlled
the
exclamation
that
was
about
to
escape
her
the
monk
appeared
to
understand
the
terms
of
this
silent
compact
for
with
a
deep
voice
he
commenced
the
offices
of
the
mass
the
singularity
of
their
situation
the
important
results
of
the
act
in
which
they
were
engaged
the
impressive
dignity
of
the
carmelite
and
the
imminent
hazard
which
they
all
ran
of
exposure
together
with
the
certainty
of
punishment
for
their
daring
to
thwart
the
will
of
venice
if
betrayed
caused
a
deeper
feeling
than
that
which
usually
pervades
a
marriage
ceremony
to
preside
at
nuptials
thus
celebrated
the
youthful
violetta
trembled
at
every
intonation
of
the
solemn
voice
of
the
monk
and
towards
the
close
she
leaned
in
helplessness
on
the
arm
of
the
man
to
whom
she
had
just
plighted
her
vows
the
eye
of
the
carmelite
kindled
as
he
proceeded
with
the
office
however
and
long
ere
he
had
done
he
had
obtained
such
a
command
over
the
feelings
of
even
annina
as
to
hold
her
mercenary
spirit
in
awe
the
final
union
was
pronounced
and
the
benediction
given
maria
of
pure
memory
watch
over
thy
happiness
daughter
said
the
monk
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
saluting
the
fair
brow
of
the
weeping
bride
duke
of
sant
agata
may
thy
patron
hear
thy
prayers
as
thou
provest
kind
to
this
innocent
and
confiding
child
amen
ha
we
are
not
too
soon
united
my
violetta
i
hear
the
sound
of
oars
a
glance
from
the
balcony
assured
him
of
the
truth
of
his
words
and
rendered
it
apparent
that
it
had
now
become
necessary
to
take
the
most
decided
step
of
all
a
gondola
of
a
size
suited
to
endure
the
waves
of
the
adriatic
at
that
mild
season
and
with
a
pavilion
of
fit
dimensions
stopped
at
the
of
the
palace
i
wonder
at
this
boldness
exclaimed
don
camillo
there
must
be
no
delay
lest
some
spy
of
the
republic
apprise
the
police
away
dearest
violetta
away
donna
florinda
father
away
the
governess
and
her
charge
passed
swiftly
into
the
inner
rooms
in
a
minute
they
returned
bearing
the
caskets
of
donna
violetta
and
a
sufficient
supply
of
necessaries
for
a
short
voyage
the
instant
they
reappeared
all
was
ready
for
don
camillo
had
long
held
himself
prepared
for
this
decisive
moment
and
the
carmelite
had
little
need
of
superfluities
it
was
no
moment
for
unnecessary
explanation
or
trivial
objections
our
hope
is
in
celerity
said
don
camillo
secresy
is
impossible
he
was
still
speaking
when
the
monk
led
the
way
from
the
room
donna
florinda
and
the
violetta
followed
don
camillo
drew
the
arm
of
annina
under
his
own
and
in
a
low
voice
bid
her
at
her
peril
refuse
to
obey
the
long
suite
of
outer
rooms
was
passed
without
meeting
a
single
observer
of
the
extraordinary
movement
but
when
the
fugitive
entered
the
great
hall
that
communicated
with
the
principal
stairs
they
found
themselves
in
the
centre
of
a
dozen
menials
of
both
sexes
place
cried
the
duke
of
sant
agata
whose
person
and
voice
were
alike
unknown
to
them
your
mistress
will
breathe
the
air
of
the
canals
wonder
and
curiosity
were
alive
in
every
countenance
but
suspicion
and
eager
attention
were
uppermost
in
the
features
of
many
the
foot
of
donna
violetta
had
scarcely
touched
the
pavement
of
the
lower
hall
when
several
menials
glided
down
the
flight
and
quitted
the
palace
by
its
different
outlets
each
sought
those
who
engaged
him
in
the
service
one
flew
along
the
narrow
streets
of
the
islands
to
the
residence
of
the
signor
gradenigo
another
sought
his
son
and
one
ignorant
of
the
person
of
him
he
served
actually
searched
an
agent
of
don
camillo
to
impart
a
circumstance
in
which
that
noble
was
himself
so
conspicuous
an
actor
to
such
a
pass
of
corruption
had
and
mystery
reduced
the
household
of
the
fairest
and
richest
in
venice
the
gondola
lay
at
the
marble
steps
of
the
water
gate
held
against
the
stones
by
two
of
its
crew
don
camillo
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
masked
gondoliers
had
neglected
none
of
the
precautions
he
had
prescribed
and
he
inwardly
commended
their
punctuality
each
wore
a
short
rapier
at
his
girdle
and
he
fancied
he
could
trace
beneath
the
folds
of
their
garments
evidence
of
the
presence
of
the
clumsy
in
use
at
that
period
these
observations
were
made
while
the
carmelite
and
violetta
entered
the
boat
donna
florinda
followed
and
annina
was
about
to
imitate
her
example
when
she
was
arrested
by
the
arm
of
don
camillo
thy
service
ends
here
whispered
the
bridegroom
seek
another
mistress
in
fault
of
a
better
thou
mayest
devote
thyself
to
venice
the
little
interruption
caused
don
camillo
to
look
backwards
and
for
a
single
moment
he
paused
to
scrutinize
the
group
of
eyes
that
crowded
the
hall
of
the
palace
at
a
respectful
distance
adieu
my
friends
he
added
those
among
ye
who
love
your
mistress
shall
be
remembered
he
would
have
said
more
but
a
rude
seizure
of
his
arms
caused
him
to
turn
hastily
away
he
was
firm
in
the
grasp
of
the
two
gondoliers
who
had
landed
while
he
was
yet
in
too
much
astonishment
to
struggle
annina
obedient
to
a
signal
darted
past
him
and
leaped
into
the
boat
the
oars
fell
into
the
water
don
camillo
was
repelled
by
a
violent
shove
backwards
into
the
hall
the
gondoliers
stepped
lightly
into
their
places
and
the
gondola
swept
away
from
the
steps
beyond
the
power
of
him
they
left
to
follow
gino
miscreant
what
means
this
treachery
the
moving
of
the
parting
gondola
was
accompanied
by
no
other
sound
than
the
usual
washing
of
the
water
in
speechless
agony
don
camillo
saw
the
boat
glide
swifter
and
swifter
at
each
stroke
of
the
oars
along
the
canal
and
then
whirling
round
the
angle
of
a
palace
disappear
venice
admitted
not
of
pursuit
like
another
city
for
there
was
no
passage
along
the
canal
taken
by
the
gondola
but
by
water
several
of
the
boats
used
by
the
family
lay
within
the
piles
on
the
great
canal
at
the
principal
entrance
and
don
camillo
was
about
to
rush
into
one
and
to
seize
its
oars
with
his
own
hands
when
the
usual
sounds
announced
the
approach
of
a
gondola
from
the
direction
of
the
bridge
that
had
so
long
served
as
a
place
of
concealment
to
his
own
domestic
it
soon
issued
from
the
obscurity
cast
by
the
shadows
of
the
houses
and
proved
to
be
a
large
gondola
pulled
like
the
one
which
had
just
disappeared
by
six
masked
gondoliers
the
resemblance
between
the
equipments
of
the
two
was
so
exact
that
at
first
not
only
the
wondering
camillo
but
all
the
others
present
fancied
the
latter
by
some
extraordinary
speed
had
already
made
the
tour
of
the
adjoining
palaces
and
was
once
more
approaching
the
private
entrance
of
that
of

this

at
a
moment
like
this

leaped
a
fearful
distance
and
happily
he
reached
the
gondola
to
pass
the
men
and
rush
into
the
canopy
needed
but
a
moment
to
perceive
that
it
was
empty
was
the
work
of
a
glance

you
dared
to
be

cried
the
confounded
noble
at
that
instant
the
clock
of
the
city
began
to
tell
the
hour
of
two
and
it
was
only
as
that
appointed
signal
sounded
heavy
and
melancholy
on
the
that
the
undeceived
camillo
got
a
certain
glimpse
of
the
truth
gino
he
said
repressing
his
voice
like
one
summoning
a
desperate
resolution
are
thy
fellows
true
as
faithful
as
your
own
vassals

not

to

and
i
do
the
man
the
justice
to
say
that
nothing

you

them
don
camillo
threw
himself
on
the
cushions
as
he
spoke
in
bitterness
of
heart
though
he
seconded
his
words
by
a
gesture
which
bid
the
men
proceed
gino
who
occupied
the
stern
and

opened
a

window
in

interior
and
bent
to
take

as
the
boat
sprang
ahead
rising
from
his
stooping
posture
the
practised
gondolier
gave
a
sweep
with
his
blade
which
caused
the
sluggish
element
of
the
narrow
canal
to
whirl
in
eddies
and
then
the
gondola
glided
into
the
great
canal
as
if
it
obeyed
an
instinct
chapter

why
liest
thou
so
on

green
earth
is
not
the
hour
of
slumber
why
so
pale
cain
notwithstanding
his
apparent
decision
the
duke
of
sant
agata
was
completely
at
a
loss
in
what
manner
to
direct
his
future
movements
that
he
had
been
duped
by
one
or
more
of
the
agents
to
whom
he
had
been
compelled
to
confide
his
necessary
preparations
for
the
flight
he
had
meditated
several
days
was
too
certain
to
admit
of
his
deceiving
himself
with
the
hopes
that
some
unaccountable
mistake
was
the
cause
of
his
loss
he
saw
at
once
that
the
senate
was
master
of
the
person
of
his
bride
and
he
too
well
knew
its
power
and
its
utter
disregard
of
human
obligations
when
any
paramount
interest
of
the
state
was
to
be
consulted
to
doubt
for
an
instant
its
willingness
to
use
its
advantage
in
any
manner
that
was
most
likely
to
contribute
to
its
own
views
by
the
premature
death
of
her
uncle
donna
violetta
had
become
the
heiress
of
vast
estates
in
the
dominions
of
the
church
and
a
compliance
with
that
jealous
and
arbitrary
law
of
venice
which
commanded
all
of
its
nobles
to
dispose
of
any
foreign
possessions
they
might
acquire
was
only
suspended
on
account
of
her
sex
and
as
has
already
been
seen
with
the
hope
of
disposing
of
her
hand
in
a
manner
that
would
prove
more
profitable
to
the
republic
with
this
object
still
before
them
and
with
the
means
of
accomplishing
it
in
their
own
hands
the
bridegroom
well
knew
that
his
marriage
would
not
only
be
denied
but
he
feared
the
witnesses
of
the
ceremony
would
be
so
disposed
of
as
to
give
little
reason
ever
to
expect
embarrassment
from
their
testimony
for
himself
personally
he
felt
less
apprehension
though
he
foresaw
that
he
had
furnished
his
opponents
with
an
argument
that
was
likely
to
defer
to
an
indefinite
period
if
it
did
not
entirely
defeat
his
claims
to
the
disputed
succession
but
he
had
already
made
up
his
mind
to
this
result
though
it
is
probable
that
his
passion
for
violetta
had
not
entirely
blinded
him
to
the
fact
that
her
roman
signories
would
be
no
unequal
offset
for
the
loss
he
believed
that
he
might
possibly
return
to
his
palace
with
impunity
so
far
as
any
personal
injury
was
concerned
for
the
great
consideration
he
enjoyed
in
his
native
land
and
the
high
interest
he
possessed
at
the
court
of
rome
were
sufficient
pledges
that
no
open
violence
would
be
done
him
the
chief
reason
why
his
claim
had
been
kept
in
suspense
was
the
wish
to
profit
by
his
near
connexion
with
the
favorite
cardinal
and
though
he
had
never
been
able
entirely
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
council
in
this
respect
he
thought
it
probable
that
the
power
of
the
vatican
would
not
be
spared
to
save
him
from
any
very
imminent
personal
hazard
still
he
had
given
the
state
of
venice
plausible
reasons
for
severity
and
liberty
just
at
that
moment
was
of
so
much
importance
that
he
dreaded
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
officials
as
one
of
the
greatest
misfortunes
which
could
momentarily
overtake
him
he
so
well
knew
the
crooked
policy
of
those
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
that
he
believed
he
might
be
arrested
solely
that
the
government
could
make
an
especial
merit
of
his
future
release
under
circumstances
of
so
seeming
gravity
his
order
to
gino
therefore
had
been
to
pull
down
the
principal
passage
towards
the
port
before
the
gondola
which
sprang
at
each
united
effort
of
its
crew
like
some
bounding
animal
entered
among
the
shipping
its
master
had
time
to
recover
his
and
to
form
some
hasty
plans
for
the
future
making
a
signal
for
the
crew
to
cease
rowing
he
came
from
beneath
the
canopy
notwithstanding
the
lateness
of
the
hour
boats
were
plying
on
the
water
within
the
town
and
the
song
was
still
audible
on
the
canals
but
among
the
mariners
a
general
stillness
prevailed
such
as
befitted
their
toil
during
the
day
and
their
ordinary
habits
call
the
first
idle
gondolier
of
thy
acquaintance
hither
gino
said
don
camillo
with
assumed
calmness
i
would
question
him
in
less
than
a
minute
he
was
gratified
hast
seen
any
strongly
manned
gondola
plying
of
late
in
this
part
of
the
canal
demanded
don
camillo
of
the
man
they
had
stopped
none
but
this
of
your
own
signore
which
is
the
fastest
of
all
that
passed
beneath
the
rialto
in
this
day
regatta
how
knowest
thou
friend
aught
of
the
speed
of
my
boat
signore
i
have
pulled
an
oar
on
the
canals
of
venice
years
and
i
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
a
gondola
move
more
swiftly
on
them
than
did
this
very
boat
but
a
few
minutes
ago
when
it
dashed
among
the
feluccas
further
down
in
the
port
as
if
it
were
again
running
for
the
oar
corpo
di
bacco
there
are
rich
wines
in
the
palaces
of
the
nobles
that
men
can
give
such
life
to
wood
whither
did
we
steer
eagerly
asked
don
camillo
blessed
san
teodoro
i
do
not
wonder
eccellenza
that
you
ask
that
question
for
though
it
is
but
a
moment
since
here
i
see
you
lying
as
motionless
on
the
water
as
a
floating
weed
friend
here
is
silver
addio
the
gondolier
swept
slowly
onwards
singing
a
strain
in
honor
of
his
bark
while
the
boat
of
don
camillo
darted
ahead
mystic
felucca
xebec
brigantine
and
ship
were
apparently
floating
past
them
as
they
shot
through
the
maze
of
shipping
when
gino
bent
forward
and
drew
the
attention
of
his
master
to
a
large
gondola
which
was
pulling
with
a
lazy
oar
towards
them
from
the
direction
of
the
lido
both
boats
were
in
a
wide
avenue
in
the
midst
of
the
vessels
the
usual
track
of
those
who
went
to
sea
and
there
was
no
object
whatever
between
them
by
changing
the
course
of
his
own
boat
don
camillo
soon
found
himself
within
an
oar
length
of
the
other
he
saw
at
a
glance
it
was
the
treacherous
gondola
by
which
he
had
been
duped
draw
men
and
follow
shouted
the
desperate
neapolitan
preparing
to
leap
into
the
midst
of
his
enemies
you
draw
against
st
mark
cried
a
warning
voice
from
beneath
the
canopy
the
chances
are
unequal
signore
for
the
smallest
signal
would
bring
twenty
galleys
to
our
succor
don
camillo
might
have
disregarded
this
menace
had
he
not
perceived
that
it
caused
the
rapiers
of
his
followers
to
return
to
their
scabbards
robber
he
answered
restore
her
whom
you
have
spirited
away
signore
you
young
nobles
are
often
pleased
to
play
your
extravagances
with
the
servants
of
the
republic
here
are
none
but
the
gondoliers
and
myself
a
movement
of
the
boat
permitted
don
camillo
to
look
into
the
covered
part
and
he
saw
that
the
other
uttered
no
more
than
the
truth
convinced
of
the
uselessness
of
further
parley
knowing
the
value
of
every
moment
and
believing
he
was
on
a
track
which
might
still
lead
to
success
the
young
neapolitan
signed
to
his
people
to
go
on
the
boats
parted
in
silence
that
of
don
camillo
proceeding
in
the
direction
from
which
the
other
had
just
come
in
a
short
time
the
gondola
of
don
camillo
was
in
an
open
part
of
the
giudecca
and
entirely
beyond
the
tiers
of
the
shipping
it
was
so
late
that
the
moon
had
begun
to
fall
and
its
light
was
cast
obliquely
on
the
bay
throwing
the
eastern
sides
of
the
buildings
and
the
other
objects
into
shadow
a
dozen
different
vessels
were
seen
aided
by
the
steering
towards
the
entrance
of
the
port
the
rays
of
the
moon
fell
upon
the
broad
surface
of
those
sides
of
their
canvas
which
were
nearest
to
the
town
and
they
resembled
so
many
spotless
clouds
sweeping
the
water
and
floating
seaward
they
are
sending
my
wife
to
dalmatia
cried
don
camillo
like
a
man
on
whom
the
truth
began
to
dawn
signore
mio
exclaimed
the
astonished
gino
i
tell
thee
sirrah
that
this
accursed
senate
hath
plotted
against
my
happiness
and
having
robbed
me
of
thy
mistress
hath
employed
one
of
the
many
feluccas
that
i
see
to
transport
her
to
some
of
its
strongholds
on
the
eastern
coast
of
the
adriatic
blessed
maria
signor
duca
and
my
honored
master
they
say
that
the
very
images
of
stone
in
venice
have
ears
and
that
the
horses
of
bronze
will
kick
if
an
evil
word
is
spoken
against
those
up
above
is
it
not
enough
varlet
to
draw
curses
from
the
meek
job
to
rob
him
of
a
wife
hast
thou
no
feeling
for
thy
mistres
i
did
not
dream
eccellenza
that
you
were
so
happy
as
to
have
the
one
or
that
i
was
so
honored
as
to
have
the
other
thou
remindest
me
of
my
folly
good
gino
in
aiding
me
on
this
occasion
thou
wilt
have
thy
own
fortune
in
view
as
thy
efforts
like
those
of
thy
fellows
will
be
made
in
behalf
of
the
lady
to
whom
i
have
just
plighted
a
husband
vows
san
theodoro
help
us
all
and
hint
what
is
to
be
done
the
lady
is
most
happy
signor
don
camillo
and
if
i
only
knew
by
what
name
to
mention
her
she
should
never
be
forgotten
in
any
prayer
that
so
humble
a
sinner
might
dare
to
offer
thou
hast
not
forgotten
the
beautiful
lady
i
drew
from
the
giudecca
corpo
di
bacco
your
eceellenza
floated
like
a
swan
and
swam
faster
than
a
gull
forgotten
signore
no
i
think
of
it
every
time
i
hear
a
plash
in
the
canals
and
every
time
i
think
of
it
i
curse
the
in
my
heart
theodore
forgive
me
if
it
be
unlike
a
christian
to
do
so
but
though
we
all
tell
marvels
of
what
our
lord
did
in
the
giudecca
the
dip
of
its
waters
is
not
the
marriage
ceremony
nor
can
we
speak
with
much
certainty
of
beauty
that
was
seen
to
so
great
disadvantage
thou
art
right
gino
but
that
lady
the
illustrious
donna
violetta
tiepolo
the
daughter
and
heiress
of
a
famed
senator
is
now
thy
mistress
it
remains
for
us
to
establish
her
in
the
castle
of
agata
where
i
shall
defy
venice
and
its
agents
gino
bowed
his
head
in
submission
though
he
cast
a
look
behind
to
make
sure
that
none
of
those
agents
whom
his
master
set
so
openly
at
defiance
were
within
in
the
meantime
the
gondola
proceeded
for
the
dialogue
in
no
manner
interrupted
the
exertions
of
gino
still
holding
the
direction
of
the
lido
as
the
freshened
the
different
vessels
in
sight
glided
away
and
by
the
time
don
camillo
reached
the
barrier
of
sand
which
separates
the
lagunes
from
the
adriatic
most
of
them
had
glided
through
the
passages
and
were
now
shaping
their
courses
according
to
their
different
destinations
across
the
open
gulf
the
young
noble
had
permitted
his
people
to
pursue
the
direction
originally
taken
in
pure
indecision
he
was
certain
that
his
bride
was
in
one
of
the
many
barques
in
sight
but
he
possessed
no
clue
to
lead
him
towards
the
right
one
nor
any
sufficient
means
of
pursuit
were
he
even
master
of
that
important
secret
when
he
landed
therefore
it
was
with
the
simple
hope
of
being
able
to
form
some
general
conjecture
as
to
the
portion
of
the
republic
dominions
in
which
he
might
search
for
her
he
had
lost
by
observing
to
what
part
of
the
adriatic
the
different
feluccas
held
their
way
he
had
determined
on
immediate
pursuit
however
and
before
he
quitted
the
gondola
he
once
more
turned
to
his
confidential
gondolier
to
give
the
necessary
instructions
thou
knowest
gino
he
said
that
there
is
one
born
a
vassal
on
my
estates
here
in
the
port
with
a
felucca
from
the
sorrentine
shore
i
know
the
man
better
than
i
know
my
own
faults
signore
or
even
my
own
virtues
go
to
him
at
once
and
make
sure
of
his
presence
i
have
imagined
a
plan
to
decoy
him
into
the
service
of
his
lord
but
i
would
now
know
the
condition
of
his
vessel
gino
said
a
few
words
in
commendation
of
the
zeal
of
his
friend
stefano
and
in
praise
of
the
bella
sorrentina
as
the
gondola
receded
from
the
shore
and
then
he
dashed
his
oar
into
the
water
like
a
man
in
earnest
to
execute
the
commission
there
is
a
lonely
spot
on
the
lido
di
palestrina
where
catholic
exclusion
has
decreed
that
the
remains
of
all
who
die
in
venice
without
the
pale
of
the
church
of
rome
shall
moulder
into
their
kindred
dust
though
it
is
not
distant
from
the
ordinary
landing
and
the
few
buildings
which
line
the
shore
it
is
a
place
that
in
itself
is
no
bad
emblem
of
a
hopeless
lot
solitary
exposed
equally
to
the
hot
airs
of
the
south
and
the
bleak
blasts
of
the
alps
frequently
covered
with
the
spray
of
the
adriatic
and
based
on
barren
sands
the
utmost
that
human
art
aided
by
a
soil
which
has
been
fattened
by
human
remains
can
do
has
been
to
create
around
the
modest
graves
a
meagre
vegetation
that
is
in
slight
contrast
to
the
sterility
of
most
of
the
bank
this
place
of
interment
is
without
the
relief
of
trees
at
the
present
day
it
is
uninclosed
and
in
the
opinions
of
those
who
have
set
it
apart
for
heretic
and
jew
it
is
unblessed
and
yet
though
condemned
alike
to
this
the
last
indignity
which
man
can
inflict
on
his
fellow
the
two
proscribed
classes
furnish
a
melancholy
proof
of
the
waywardness
of
human
passions
and
prejudice
by
refusing
to
share
in
common
the
scanty
pittance
of
earth
which
bigotry
has
allowed
for
their
everlasting
repose
while
the
protestant
sleeps
by
the
side
of
the
protestant
in
exclusive
obloquy
the
children
of
israel
moulder
apart
on
the
same
barren
heath
sedulous
to
preserve
even
in
the
grave
the
outward
distinctions
of
faith
we
shall
not
endeavor
to
seek
that
principle
which
renders
man
so
callous
to
the
most
eloquent
and
striking
appeals
to
liberality
but
rest
satisfied
with
being
grateful
that
we
have
been
born
in
a
land
in
which
the
interests
of
religion
are
as
little
as
possible
sullied
by
the
vicious
contamination
of
those
of
life
in
which
christian
humility
is
not
exhibited
beneath
the
purple
nor
jewish
adhesion
by
intolerance
in
which
man
is
left
to
care
for
the
welfare
of
his
own
soul
and
in
which
so
far
as
the
human
eye
can
penetrate
god
is
worshipped
for
himself
don
camillo
monforte
landed
near
the
retired
graves
of
the
proscribed
as
he
wished
to
ascend
the
low
which
have
been
thrown
up
by
the
waves
and
the
winds
of
the
gulf
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
lido
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
pass
directly
across
the
contemned
spot
or
make
such
a
circuit
as
would
have
been
inconvenient
crossing
himself
with
a
superstition
that
was
interwoven
with
all
his
habits
and
opinions
and
loosening
his
rapier
in
order
that
he
might
not
miss
the
succor
of
that
good
weapon
at
need
he
moved
across
the
heath
tenanted
by
the
despised
dead
taking
care
to
avoid
the
mouldering
heaps
of
earth
which
lay
above
the
bones
of
heretic
or
jew
he
had
not
threaded
more
than
half
the
graves
however
when
a
human
form
arose
from
the
grass
and
seemed
to
walk
like
one
who
mused
on
the
moral
that
the
piles
at
his
feet
would
be
apt
to
excite
again
don
camillo
touched
the
handle
of
his
rapier
then
moving
aside
in
a
manner
to
give
himself
an
equal
advantage
from
the
light
of
the
moon
he
drew
near
the
stranger
his
footstep
was
heard
for
the
other
paused
regarded
the
approaching
cavalier
and
folding
his
arms
as
it
might
be
in
sign
of
neutrality
awaited
his
nearer
approach
thou
hast
chosen
a
melancholy
hour
for
thy
walk
signore
said
the
young
neapolitan
and
a
still
more
melancholy
scene
i
hope
i
do
not
intrude
on
an
israelite
or
a
lutheran
who
mourns
for
his
friend

the

in
a
manner
that
threw
all
of
its
mild
light
upon
his
features

the

recoiling
as

habitually
when

unexpectedly

moment

glittered
in
the
rays
of
the

keep
thy
distance
fellow
and
explain
the
motive
that
hath
brought
thee
thus
across
my
solitude
the
bravo
smiled
but
his
arms
maintained
their
fold
i
might
with
equal
justice
call
upon
the
duke
of

to
furnish
reasons
why
he
wanders
at
this
hour
among
the
hebrew

nay
spare
thy
pleasantry
i
trifle
not
with
men
of
thy
reputation
if
any
in
venice
have
thought
fit
to
employ
thee
against
my
person
thou
wilt
have
need
of
all
thy
courage
and
skill
ere
thou
earnest
thy
fee

up
thy

here
is
none
to
do
you
harm
think
you
if
employed
in
the
manner
you
name
i
would
be
in
this
spot
to
seek
you
ask
yourself
whether
your
visit
here
was
known
or
whether
it
was
more
than
the
idle
caprice
of
a
young
noble
who
finds
his
bed
less
easy
than
his
gondola
we
have
met
duke
of
sant
agata
when
you
distrusted
my
honor
less
thou
speakest
true
jacopo
returned
the
noble
suffering
the
point
of
his
rapier
to
fall
from
before
the
breast
of
the
bravo
though
he
still
hesitated
to
withdraw
the
weapon
thou
sayest
the
truth
my
visit
to
this
spot
is
indeed
accidental
and
thou
not
have
possibly
foreseen
it
why
art
thou
here
why
are
these
here
demanded
jacopo
pointing
to
the
graves
at
his
feet
we
are
born

we
die
that
much
is
known
to
us
all
but
the
when
and
the
where
are
mysteries

thou
art
not
a
man
to
act
without
good
motive
though
these
israelites
could
not
foresee
their
visit
to
the

thine
hath
not

yon
city
of
crimes
as
the
bravo
spoke
he
shook
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
domes
of
mark
and
the
deep
tones
of
his
voice
appeared
to
heave
up
from
the
depths
of
his
chest
this
is
extraordinary
language
for
a
bravo
speak
the
word
boldly
signore
it
is
no
stranger
to
my
ears
but
even
the
stiletto
of
a
bravo
is
honorable
compared
to
that
sword
of
pretended
justice
which
mark
wields
the
commonest
hireling
of
italy
he
who
will
plant
his
dagger
in
the
heart
of
his
friend
for
two
sequins
is
a
man
of
open
dealing
compared
to
the
merciless
treachery
of
some
in
yonder
town
i
understand
thee
jacopo
thou
art
at
length
proscribed
the
public
voice
faint
as
it
is
in
the
republic
has
finally
reached
the
ears
of
thy
employers
and
they
withdraw
their
protection
jacopo
regarded
the
noble
for
an
instant
with
an
expression
so
ambiguous
as
to
cause
the
latter
insensibly
to
raise
the
point
of
his
rapier
but
when
he
answered
it
was
with
his
ordinary
quiet
signor
duca
he
said
i
have
been
thought
worthy
to
be
retained
by
don
camillo
monforte
i
deny
it
not
and
now
that
thou
recallest
the
occasion
new
light
breaks
in
upon
me
villain
to
thy
faithlessness
i
owe
the
loss
of
my
bride
though
the
rapier
was
at
the
very
throat
of
jacopo
he
did
not
flinch
gazing
at
his
excited
companion
he
laughed
in
a
smothered
manner
but
bitterly
it
would
seem
that
the
lord
of
sant
agata
wishes
to
rob
me
of
my
trade
he
said
arise
ye
israelites
and
bear
witness
lest
men
doubt
the
fact
a
common
bravo
of
the
canals
is
waylaid
among
your
despised
graves
by
the
proudest
signor
of
calabria
you
have
chosen
your
spot
in
mercy
don
camillo
for
sooner
or
later
this
crumbling
and
earth
is
to
receive
me
were
i
to
die
at
the
altar
itself
with
the
most
penitent
prayer
of
holy
church
on
my
lips
the
bigots
would
send
my
body
to
rest
among
these
hungry
hebrews
and
accursed
heretics
yes
i
am
a
man
proscribed
and
unfit
to
sleep
with
the
faithful
his
companion
spoke
with
so
strange
a
mixture
of
irony
and
melancholy
that
the
purpose
of
don
camillo
wavered
but
remembering
his
loss
he
shook
the
rapier
point
and
continued
thy
taunts
and
effrontery
will
not
avail
thee
knave
he
cried
thou
knowest
that
i
would
have
engaged
thee
as
the
leader
of
a
chosen
band
to
favor
the
flight
of
one
dear
from
venice
nothing
more
true
signore
and
thou
didst
refuse
the
service
noble
duke
i
did
not
content
with
this
having
learned
the
particulars
of
my
project
thou
sold
the
secret
to
the
senate
don
camillo
monforte
i
did
not
my
engagements
with
the
council
would
not
permit
me
to
serve
you
else
by
the
brightest
star
of
yonder
vault
it
would
have
gladdened
my
heart
to
have
witnessed
the
happiness
of
two
young
and
faithful
lovers
no
no
no
they
know
me
not
who
think
i
can
not
find
pleasure
in
the
joy
of
another
i
told
you
that
i
was
the
senate
and
there
the
matter
ended
and
i
had
the
weakness
to
believe
thee
jacopo
for
thou
hast
a
character
so
strangely
compounded
of
good
and
evil
and
bearest
so
fair
a
name
for
observance
of
thy
faith
that
the
seeming
frankness
of
the
answer
lulled
me
to
security
fellow
i
have
been
betrayed
and
that
at
the
moment
when
i
thought
success
most
sure
jacopo
manifested
interest
but
as
he
moved
slowly
on
accompanied
by
the
vigilant
and
zealous
noble
he
smiled
coldly
like
one
who
had
pity
for
the
other
credulity
in
bitterness
of
soul
i
have
cursed
the
whole
race
for
its
treachery
continued
the
neapolitan
this
is
rather
for
the
priore
of
mark
than
for
the
ear
of
one
who
carries
a
public
stiletto
my
gondola
has
been
imitated
the
liveries
of
my
people
copied
my
bride
stolen
thou
answerest
not
jacopo
what
answer
would
you
have
you
have
been
cozened
signore
in
a
state
whose
very
prince
dare
not
trust
his
secrets
to
his
wife
you
would
have
robbed
venice
of
an
heiress
and
venice
has
robbed
you
of
a
bride
you
have
played
high
don
camillo
and
have
lost
a
heavy
stake
you
have
thought
of
your
own
wishes
and
rights
while
you
have
pretended
to
serve
venice
with
the
spaniard
don
camillo
started
in
surprise
why
this
wonder
signore
you
forget
that
i
have
lived
much
among
those
who
weigh
the
chances
of
every
political
interest
and
that
your
name
is
often
in
their
mouths
this
marriage
is
doubly
disagreeable
to
venice
who
has
nearly
as
much
need
of
the
bridegroom
as
of
the
bride
the
council
hath
long
ago
forbidden
the
banns
aye
but
the
means
explain
the
means
by
which
i
have
been
duped
lest
the
treachery
be
ascribed
to
thee
signore
the
very
marbles
of
the
city
give
up
their
secrets
to
the
state
i
have
seen
much
and
understood
much
when
my
superiors
have
believed
me
merely
a
tool
but
i
have
seen
much
that
even
those
who
employed
me
could
not
comprehend
i
could
have
foretold
this
consummation
of
your
nuptials
had
i
known
of
their
celebration
this
thou
not
have
done
without
being
an
agent
of
their
treachery
the
schemes
of
the
selfish
may
be
foretold
it
is
only
the
generous
and
the
honest
that
baffle
calculation
he
who
can
gain
a
knowledge
of
the
present
interest
of
venice
is
master
of
her
dearest
secrets
of
state
for
what
she
wishes
she
will
do
unless
the
service
cost
too
dear
as
for
the
means
how
can
they
be
wanting
in
a
household
like
yours
signore
i
trusted
none
but
those
deepest
in
my
confidence
don
camillo
there
is
not
a
servitor
in
your
palace
gino
alone
excepted
who
is
not
a
hireling
of
the
senate
or
of
its
agents
the
very
gondoliers
who
row
you
to
your
daily
pleasures
have
had
their
hauds
crossed
with
the
republic
sequins
nay
they
are
not
only
paid
to
watch
you
but
to
watch
each
other
can
this
be
true
have
you
ever
doubted
it
signore
asked
jacopo
looking
up
like
one
who
admired
another
simplicity
i
knew
them
to
be
false
pretenders
to
a
faith
that
in
secret
they
mock
but
i
had
not
believed
they
dared
to
tamper
with
the
very
menials
of
my
person
this
undermining
of
the
security
of
families
is
to
destroy
society
at
its
core
you
talk
like
one
who
hath
not
been
long
a
bridegroom
signore
said
the
bravo
with
a
hollow
laugh
a
year
hence
you
may
know
what
it
is
to
have
your
own
wife
turning
your
secret
thoughts
into
gold
and
thou
servest
them
jacopo
who
does
not
in
some
manner
suited
to
his
habits
we
are
not
masters
of
our
fortune
don
camillo
or
the
duke
of
sant
agata
would
not
be
turning
his
influence
with
a
relative
to
the
advantage
of
the
republic
what
i
have
done
hath
not
been
done
without
bitter
penitence
and
an
agony
of
soul
that
your
own
light
servitude
may
have
spared
you
signore
poor
jacopo
if
i
have
lived
through
it
all
is
because
one
mightier
than
the
state
hath
not
deserted
me
but
don
camillo
monforte
there
are
crimes
which
pass
beyond
the
powers
of
man
to
endure
the
bravo
shuddered
and
he
moved
among
the
despised
graves
in
silence
they
have
then
proved
too
ruthless
even
for
thee
said
don
camillo
who
watched
the
contracting
eye
and
heaving
form
of
his
companion
in
wonder
signore
they
have
i
have
witnessed
this
night
a
proof
of
their
heartlessness
and
bad
faith
that
hath
caused
me
to
look
forward
to
my
own
fate
the
delusion
is
over
from
this
hour
i
serve
them
no
longer
the
bravo
spoke
with
deep
feeling
and
his
companion
fancied
strange
as
it
was
coming
from
such
a
man
with
an
air
of
wounded
integrity
don
camillo
knew
that
there
was
no
condition
of
life
however
degraded
or
lost
to
the
world
which
had
not
its
own
particular
opinions
of
the
faith
due
to
its
fellows
and
he
had
seen
enough
of
the
sinuous
course
of
the
oligarchy
of
venice
to
understand
that
it
was
quite
possible
its
shameless
and
irresponsible
duplicity
might
offend
the
principles
of
even
an
assassin
less
odium
was
attached
to
men
of
that
class
in
italy
and
at
that
day
than
will
be
easily
imagined
in
a
country
like
this
for
the
radical
defects
and
the
vicious
administration
of
the
laws
caused
an
irritable
and
sensitive
people
too
often
to
take
into
their
own
hands
the
right
of
redressing
their
own
wrongs
custom
had
lessened
the
odium
of
the
crime
and
though
society
denounced
the
assassin
himself
it
is
scarcely
too
much
to
say
that
his
employer
was
regarded
with
little
more
disgust
than
the
religious
of
our
time
regard
the
survivor
of
a
private
combat
still
it
was
not
usual
for
nobles
like
don
camillo
to
hold
intercourse
beyond
that
which
the
required
service
exacted
with
men
of
jacopo
cast
but
the
language
and
manner
of
the
bravo
so
strongly
attracted
the
curiosity
and
even
the
sympathy
of
his
companion
that
the
latter
unconsciously
sheathed
his
rapier
and
drew
nearer
thy
penitence
and
regrets
jacopo
may
lead
thee
yet
nearer
to
virtue
he
said
than
mere
abandonment
of
the
senate
service
seek
out
some
godly
priest
and
ease
thy
soul
by
confession
and
prayer
the
bravo
trembled
in
every
limb
and
his
eye
turned
wistfully
to
the
countenance
of
the
other
speak
jacopo
even
i
will
hear
thee
if
thou
remove
the
mountain
from
thy
breast
thanks
noble
signore
a
thousand
thanks
for
this
glimpse
of
sympathy
to
which
i
have
long
been
a
stranger
none
know
how
dear
a
word
of
kindness
is
to
one
who
has
been
condemned
by
all
as
i
have
been
i
have
prayed
i
have
craved
i
have
wept
for
some
ear
to
listen
to
my
tale
and
i
thought
i
had
found
one
who
would
have
heard
me
without
scorn
when
the
cold
policy
of
the
senate
struck
him
i
came
here
to
commune
with
the
hated
dead
when
chance
brought
us
together
could
i
the
bravo
paused
and
looked
doubtfully
again
at
his
companion
say
on
jacopo
i
have
not
dared
to
trust
my
secrets
even
to
the
confessional
signore
and
can
i
be
so
bold
as
to
offer
them
to
you
truly
it
is
a
strange
behest
signore
it
is
you
are
noble
i
am
of
humble
blood
your
ancestors
were
senators
and
doges
of
venice
while
mine
have
been
since
the
fishermen
first
built
their
huts
in
the
lagunes
laborers
on
the
canals
and
rowers
of
gondolas
you
are
powerful
and
rich
and
courted
while
i
am
denounced
and
in
secret
i
fear
condemned
in
short
you
are
don
camillo
monforte
and
i
am
jacopo
frontoni
don
camillo
was
touched
for
the
bravo
spoke
without
bitterness
and
in
deep
sorrow
i
would
thou
wert
at
the
confessional
poor
jacopo
he
said
i
am
little
able
to
give
ease
to
such
a
burden
signore
i
have
lived
too
long
shut
out
from
the
good
wishes
of
my
fellows
and
i
can
bear
with
it
no
longer
the
accursed
senate
may
cut
me
off
without
warning
and
then
who
will
stop
to
look
at
my
grave
signore
i
must
speak
or
die
thy
case
is
piteous
jacopo
thou
hast
need
of
ghostly
counsel
here
is
no
priest
signore
and
i
carry
a
weight
past
bearing
the
only
man
who
has
shown
interest
in
me
for
three
long
and
dreadful
years
is
gone
but
he
will
return
poor
jacopo
signore
he
will
never
return
he
is
with
the
fishes
of
the
lagunes
by
thy
hand
monster
by
the
justice
of
the
illustrious
republic
said
the
bravo
with
a
smothered
but
bitter
smile
ha
they
are
then
awake
to
the
acts
of
thy
class
thy
repentance
is
the
fruit
of
fear
jacopo
seemed
choked
he
had
evidently
counted
on
the
awakened
sympathy
of
his
companion
notwithstanding
the
difference
in
their
situations
and
to
be
thus
thrown
off
again
unmanned
him
he
shuddered
and
every
muscle
and
nerve
appeared
about
to
yield
its
power
touched
by
so
unequivocal
signs
of
suffering
don
camillo
kept
close
at
his
side
reluctant
to
enter
more
deeply
into
the
feelings
of
one
of
his
known
character
and
yet
unable
to
desert
a
in
so
grievous
agony
signor
duca
said
the
bravo
with
a
pathos
in
his
voice
that
went
to
the
heart
of
his
auditor
leave
me
if
they
ask
for
a
proscribed
man
let
them
come
here
in
the
morning
they
will
find
my
body
near
the
graves
of
the
heretics
speak
i
will
hear
thee
jacopo
looked
up
with
doubt
expressed
on
his
features
unburden
thyself
i
will
listen
though
thou
recounted
the
assassination
of
my
dearest
friend
the
oppressed
bravo
gazed
at
him
as
if
he
still
distrusted
his
sincerity
his
face
worked
and
his
look
became
still
more
wistful
but
as
don
camillo
faced
the
moon
and
betrayed
the
extent
of
his
sympathy
the
other
burst
into
tears
jacopo
i
will
hear
thee
i
will
hear
thee
poor
jacopo
cried
don
camillo
shocked
at
this
exhibition
of
distress
in
one
so
stern
by
nature
a
wave
from
the
hand
of
the
bravo
silenced
him
and
jacopo
struggling
with
himself
for
a
moment
spoke
you
have
saved
a
soul
from
perdition
signore
he
said
smothering
his
emotion
if
the
happy
knew
how
much
power
belongs
to
a
single
word
of
kindness
a
glance
of
feeling
when
given
to
the
despised
they
would
not
look
so
coldly
on
the
miserable
this
night
must
have
been
my
last
had
you
cast
me
off
without
pity
but
you
will
hear
my
tale
signore
you
will
not
scorn
the
confession
of
a
bravo
i
have
promised
be
brief
for
at
this
moment
i
have
great
care
of
my
own
signore
i
know
not
the
whole
of
your
wrongs
but
they
will
not
be
less
likely
to
be
redressed
for
this
grace
jacopo
made
an
effort
to
command
himself
when
he
commenced
his
tale
the
course
of
the
narrative
does
not
require
that
we
should
accompany
this
extraordinary
man
though
the
relation
of
the
secrets
he
imparted
to
don
camillo
it
is
enough
for
our
present
purposes
to
say
that
as
he
proceeded
the
young
calabrian
noble
drew
nearer
to
his
side
and
listened
with
growing
interest
the
duke
of
sant
agata
scarcely
breathed
while
his
companion
with
that
energy
of
language
and
feeling
which
marks
italian
character
recounted
his
secret
sorrows
and
the
scenes
in
which
he
had
been
an
actor
long
before
he
was
done
don
camillo
had
forgotten
his
own
private
causes
of
concern
and
by
the
time
the
tale
was
finished
every
shade
of
disgust
had
given
place
to
an
ungovernable
expression
of
pity
in
short
so
eloquent
was
the
speaker
and
so
interesting
the
facts
with
which
he
dealt
that
he
seemed
to
play
with
the
sympathies
of
the
listener
as
the
improvisatore
of
that
region
is
known
to
lead
captive
the
passions
of
the
admiring
crowd
during
the
time
jacopo
was
speaking
he
and
his
wondering
auditor
had
passed
the
limits
of
the
despised
cemetery
and
as
the
voice
of
the
former
ceased
they
stood
on
the
outer
beach
of
the
lido
when
the
low
tones
of
the
bravo
were
no
longer
audible
they
were
succeeded
by
the
sullen
wash
of
the
adriatic
this
surpasseth
belief
don
camillo
exclaimed
after
a
long
pause
which
had
only
been
disturbed
by
the
rush
and
retreat
of
the
waters
signore
as
holy
maria
is
kind
it
is
true
i
doubt
you
not
jacopo
poor
jacopo
i
can
not
distrust
a
tale
thus
told
thou
hast
indeed
been
a
victim
of
their
hellish
duplicity
and
well
mayest
thou
say
the
load
was
past
bearing
what
is
thy
intention
i
serve
them
no
longer
don
camillo
i
wait
only
for
the
last
solemn
scene
which
is
now
certain
and
then
i
quit
this
city
of
deceit
to
seek
my
fortune
in
another
region
they
have
blasted
my
youth
and
loaded
my
name
with
infamy
god
may
yet
lighten
the
load
reproach
not
thyself
beyond
reason
jacopo
for
the
happiest
and
most
fortunate
of
us
all
are
not
above
the
power
of
temptation
thou
knowest
that
even
my
name
and
rank
have
not
altogether
protected
me
from
their
arts
i
know
them
capable
signore
of
deluding
angels
their
arts
are
only
surpassed
by
their
means
and
their
pretence
of
virtue
by
their
indifference
to
its
practice
thou
sayest
true
jacopo
the
truth
is
never
in
greater
danger
than
when
whole
communities
lend
themselves
to
the
vicious
deception
of
seemliness
and
without
truth
there
is
no
virtue
this
it
is
to
substitute
profession
for
practice
to
use
the
altar
for
a
worldly
purpose
and
to
bestow
power
without
any
other
responsibility
than
that
which
is
exacted
by
the
selfishness
of
caste
jacopo
poor
jacopo
thou
shalt
be
my
servitor
i
am
lord
of
my
own
seignories
and
once
rid
of
this
specious
republic
i
charge
myself
with
the
care
of
thy
safety
and
fortunes
be
at
peace
as
respects
thy
conscience
i
have
interest
near
the
holy
see
and
thou
shalt
not
want
absolution
the
gratitude
of
the
bravo
was
more
vivid
in
feeling
than
in
expression
he
kissed
the
hand
of
don
camillo
but
it
was
with
a
reservation
of
that
belonged
to
the
character
of
the
man
a
system
like
this
of
venice
continued
the
musing
noble
leaves
none
of
us
masters
of
our
own
acts
the
wiles
of
such
a
combination
are
stronger
than
the
will
it
cloaks
its
offences
against
right
in
a
thousand
specious
forms
and
it
enlists
the
support
of
every
man
under
the
pretence
of
a
sacrifice
for
the
common
good
we
often
fancy
ourselves
simple
dealers
in
some
justifiable
state
intrigue
when
in
truth
we
are
deep
in
sin
falsehood
is
the
parent
of
all
crimes
and
in
no
case
has
it
a
progeny
so
numerous
as
that
in
which
its
own
birth
is
derived
from
the
state
i
fear
i
may
have
made
sacrifices
to
this
treacherous
influence
i
could
wish
forgotten
though
don
camillo
soliloquized
rather
than
addressed
his
companion
it
was
evident
by
the
train
of
his
thoughts
that
the
narrative
of
jacopo
had
awakened
disagreeable
reflections
on
the
manner
in
which
he
had
pushed
his
own
claims
with
the
senate
perhaps
he
felt
the
necessity
of
some
apology
to
one
who
though
so
much
his
inferior
in
rank
was
so
competent
to
appreciate
his
conduct
and
who
had
just
denounced
in
the
strongest
language
his
own
fatal
subserviency
to
the
arts
of
that
irresponsible
and
meretricious
body
jacopo
uttered
a
few
words
of
a
general
nature
but
such
as
had
a
tendency
to
quiet
the
uneasiness
of
his
companion
after
which
with
a
readiness
that
proved
him
qualified
for
the
many
delicate
missions
with
which
he
had
been
charged
he
ingeniously
turned
the
discourse
to
the
recent
abduction
of
donna
violetta
with
the
offer
of
rendering
his
new
employer
all
the
services
in
his
power
to
regain
his
bride
that
thou
mayest
know
all
thou
hast
undertaken
rejoined
don
camillo
listen
jacopo
and
i
will
conceal
nothing
from
thy
shrewdness
the
duke
of
sant
agata
now
briefly
but
explicitly
laid
bare
to
his
companion
all
his
own
views
and
measures
with
respect
to
her
he
loved
and
all
those
events
with
which
the
reader
has
already
become
acquainted
the
bravo
gave
great
attention
to
the
minutest
parts
of
the
detail
and
more
than
once
as
the
other
proceeded
he
smiled
to
himself
like
a
man
who
was
able
to
trace
the
secret
means
by
which
this
or
that
intrigue
had
been
effected
the
whole
was
just
related
when
the
sound
of
a
footstep
announced
the
return
of
gino
chapter
xviii
pale
she
looked
yet
cheerful
though
methought
once
if
not
twice
she
wiped
away
a
tear
that
would
be
coming
rogers
the
hours
passed
as
if
naught
had
occurred
within
the
barriers
of
the
city
to
disturb
their
progress
on
the
following
morning
men
proceeded
to
their
several
pursuits
of
business
or
of
pleasure
as
had
been
done
for
ages
and
none
stopped
to
question
his
neighbor
of
the
scene
which
might
have
taken
place
during
the
night
some
were
gay
and
others
sorrowing
some
idle
and
others
occupied
here
one
toiled
there
another
sported
and
venice
presented
as
of
wont
its
noiseless
suspicious
busy
mysterious
and
yet
stirring
throngs
as
it
had
before
done
at
a
thousand
similar
risings
of
the
sun
the
menials
lingered
around
the
of
donna
violetta
palace
with
distrustful
but
cautious
faces
scarce
whispering
among
themselves
their
secret
suspicions
of
the
fate
of
their
mistress
the
residence
of
the
signor
gradenigo
presented
its
usual
gloomy
magnificence
while
the
abode
of
don
camillo
monforte
betrayed
no
sign
of
the
heavy
disappointment
which
its
master
had
sustained
the
bella
sorrentina
still
lay
in
the
port
with
a
yard
on
deck
while
the
crew
repaired
its
sails
in
the
lazy
manner
of
mariners
who
work
without
excitement
the
lagunes
were
dotted
with
the
boats
of
fishermen
and
travellers
arrived
and
departed
from
the
city
by
the
well
known
channels
of
fusina
and
mestre
here
some
adventurer
from
the
north
quitted
the
canals
on
his
return
towards
the
alps
carrying
with
him
a
pleasing
picture
of
the
ceremonies
he
had
witnessed
mingled
with
some
crude
conjectures
of
that
power
which
predominated
in
the
suspected
state
and
there
a
countryman
of
the
main
sought
his
little
farm
satisfied
with
the
pageants
and
regatta
of
the
previous
day
in
short
all
seemed
as
usual
and
the
events
we
have
related
remained
a
secret
with
the
actors
and
that
mysterious
council
which
had
so
large
a
share
in
their
existence
as
the
day
advanced
many
a
sail
was
spread
for
the
pillars
of
hercules
or
the
genial
levant
and
feluccas
mystics
and
golettas
went
and
came
as
the
land
or
prevailed
still
the
mariner
of
calabria
lounged
beneath
the
awning
which
sheltered
his
deck
or
took
his
siesta
on
a
pile
of
old
sails
which
were
ragged
with
the
force
of
many
a
hot
sirocco
as
the
sun
fell
the
gondolas
of
the
great
and
idle
began
to
glide
over
the
water
and
when
the
two
squares
were
cooled
by
the
air
of
the
adriatic
the
broglio
began
to
fill
with
those
privileged
to
pace
its
vaulted
passage
among
these
came
the
duke
of
sant
agata
who
though
an
alien
to
the
laws
of
the
republic
being
of
so
illustrious
descent
and
of
claims
so
equitable
was
received
among
the
senators
in
their
moments
of
ease
as
a
welcome
sharer
in
this
vain
distinction
he
entered
the
broglio
at
the
wonted
hour
and
with
his
usual
composure
for
he
trusted
to
his
secret
influence
at
rome
and
something
to
the
success
of
his
rivals
for
impunity
reflection
had
shown
don
camillo
that
as
his
plans
were
known
to
the
council
they
would
long
since
have
arrested
him
had
such
been
their
intention
and
it
had
also
led
him
to
believe
that
the
most
efficient
manner
of
avoiding
the
personal
consequences
of
his
adventure
was
to
show
confidence
in
his
own
power
to
withstand
them
when
he
appeared
therefore
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
high
officer
of
the
papal
embassy
and
with
an
eye
that
spoke
assurance
in
himself
he
was
greeted
as
usual
by
all
who
knew
him
as
was
due
to
his
rank
and
expectations
still
don
camillo
walked
among
the
patricians
of
the
republic
with
novel
sensations
more
than
once
he
thought
he
detected
in
the
wandering
glances
of
those
with
whom
he
conversed
signs
of
their
knowledge
of
his
frustrated
attempt
and
more
than
once
when
he
least
suspected
such
scrutiny
his
countenance
was
watched
as
if
the
observer
sought
some
evidence
of
his
future
intentions
beyond
this
none
might
have
discovered
that
an
heiress
of
so
much
importance
had
been
so
near
being
lost
to
the
state
or
on
the
other
hand
that
a
bridegroom
had
been
robbed
of
his
bride
habitual
art
on
the
part
of
the
state
and
resolute
but
wary
intention
on
the
part
of
the
young
noble
concealed
all
else
from
observation
in
this
manner
the
day
passed
not
a
tongue
in
venice
beyond
those
which
whispered
in
secret
making
any
allusion
to
the
incidents
of
our
tale
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
a
gondola
swept
slowly
up
to
the
of
the
ducal
palace
the
gondolier
landed
fastened
his
boat
in
the
usual
manner
to
the
and
entered
the
court
he
wore
a
mask
for
the
hour
of
disguise
had
come
and
his
attire
was
so
like
the
ordinary
fashion
of
men
of
his
class
as
to
defeat
recognition
by
its
simplicity
glancing
an
eye
about
him
he
entered
the
building
by
a
private
door
the
edifice
in
which
the
doges
of
venice
dwelt
still
stands
a
gloomy
monument
of
the
policy
of
the
republic
furnishing
evidence
in
itself
of
the
specious
character
of
the
prince
whom
it
held
it
is
built
around
a
vast
but
gloomy
court
as
is
usual
with
nearly
all
of
the
principal
edifices
of
europe
one
of
its
fronts
forms
a
side
of
the
piazzetta
so
often
mentioned
and
another
lines
the
quay
next
the
port
the
architecture
of
these
two
exterior
faces
of
the
palace
renders
the
structure
remarkable
a
low
portico
which
forms
the
broglio
sustains
a
row
of
massive
oriental
windows
and
above
these
again
lies
a
pile
of
masonry
slightly
relieved
by
apertures
which
reverses
the
ordinary
uses
of
the
art
a
third
front
is
nearly
concealed
by
the
cathedral
of
mark
and
the
fourth
is
washed
by
its
canal
the
public
prison
of
the
city
forms
the
other
side
of
this
canal
eloquently
proclaiming
the
nature
of
the
government
by
the
close
approximation
of
the
powers
of
legislation
and
of
punishment
the
famous
bridge
of
sighs
is
the
material
and
we
might
add
the
metaphorical
link
between
the
two
the
latter
edifice
stands
on
the
quay
also
and
though
less
lofty
and
spacious
in
point
of
architectural
beauty
it
is
the
superior
structure
though
the
quaintness
and
unusual
style
of
the
palace
are
most
apt
to
attract
attention
the
masked
gondolier
soon
reappeared
beneath
the
arch
of
the
and
with
a
hurried
step
he
sought
his
boat
it
required
but
a
minute
to
cross
the
canal
to
land
on
the
opposite
quay
and
to
enter
the
public
door
of
the
prison
it
would
seem
that
he
had
some
secret
means
of
satisfying
the
vigilance
of
the
different
keepers
for
bolts
were
drawn
and
doors
unlocked
with
little
question
wherever
he
presented
himself
in
this
manner
he
quickly
passed
all
the
outer
barriers
of
the
place
and
reached
a
part
of
the
building
which
had
the
appearance
of
being
fitted
for
the
accommodation
of
a
family
judging
from
the
air
of
all
around
him
those
who
dwelt
there
took
the
luxury
of
their
abode
but
little
into
the
account
though
neither
the
furniture
nor
the
rooms
were
wanting
in
most
of
the
necessaries
suited
to
people
of
their
class
and
the
climate
and
in
that
age
the
gondolier
had
ascended
a
private
stairway
and
he
was
now
before
a
door
which
had
none
of
those
signs
of
a
prison
that
so
freely
abounded
in
other
parts
of
the
building
he
paused
to
listen
and
then
tapped
with
singular
caution
who
is
without
asked
a
gentle
female
voice
at
the
same
instant
that
the
latch
moved
and
fell
again
as
if
she
within
waited
to
be
assured
of
the
character
of
her
visitor
before
she
opened
the
door
a
friend
to
thee
gelsomina
was
the
answer
nay
here
all
are
friends
to
the
keepers
if
words
can
be
believed
you
must
name
yourself
or
go
elsewhere
for
your
answer
the
gondolier
removed
the
mask
a
little
which
had
altered
his
voice
as
well
as
concealed
his
face
it
is
i
gessina
he
said
using
the
diminutive
of
her
name
the
bolts
grated
and
the
door
was
hurriedly
opened
it
is
wonderful
that
i
did
not
know
thee
carlo
said
the
female
with
eager
simplicity
but
thou
takest
so
many
disguises
of
late
and
so
counterfeitest
strange
voices
that
thine
own
mother
might
have
distrusted
her
ear
the
gondolier
paused
to
make
certain
they
were
alone
then
laying
aside
the
mask
altogether
he
exposed
the
features
of
the
bravo
thou
knowest
the
need
of
caution
he
added
and
wilt
not
judge
me
harshly
i
said
not
that
carlo
but
thy
voice
is
so
familiar
that
i
thought
it
wonderful
thou
speak
as
a
stranger
hast
thou
aught
for
me
the
gentle
girl
for
she
was
both
young
and
gentle
hesitated
hast
thou
aught
new
gelsomina
repeated
the
bravo
reading
her
innocent
face
with
his
searching
gaze
thou
art
fortunate
in
not
being
sooner
in
the
prison
i
have
just
had
a
visitor
thou
not
have
liked
to
be
seen
carlo
thou
knowest
i
have
good
reasons
for
coming
masked
i
might
or
i
might
not
have
disliked
thy
acquaintance
as
he
should
have
proved
nay
now
thou
judgest
wrong
returned
the
female
hastily
i
had
no
other
here
but
my
cousin
annina
dost
thou
think
me
jealous
said
the
bravo
smiling
in
kindness
as
he
took
her
hand
had
it
been
thy
cousin
pietro
or
michele
or
roberto
or
any
other
youth
of
venice
i
should
have
no
other
dread
than
that
of
being
known
but
it
was
only
annina
my
cousin
annina
whom
thou
hast
never
seen
and
i
have
no
cousins
pietro
and
michele
and
roberto
we
are
not
many
carlo
annina
has
a
brother
but
he
never
comes
hither
indeed
it
is
long
since
she
has
found
it
convenient
to
quit
her
trade
to
come
to
this
dreary
place
few
children
of
sisters
see
each
other
so
seldom
as
annina
and
i
thou
art
a
good
girl
gessina
and
art
always
to
be
found
near
thy
mother
hast
thou
naught
in
particular
for
my
ear
again
the
soft
eyes
of
gelsomina
or
gessina
as
she
was
familiarly
called
dropped
to
the
floor
but
raising
them
ere
he
could
note
the
circumstance
she
hurriedly
continued
the
discourse
i
fear
annina
will
return
or
i
would
go
with
thee
at
once
is
this
cousin
of
thine
still
here
then
asked
the
bravo
with
uneasiness
thou
knowest
i
would
not
be
seen
fear
not
she
can
not
enter
without
touching
that
bell
for
she
is
above
with
my
poor
mother
thou
go
into
the
inner
room
as
usual
when
she
comes
and
listen
to
her
idle
discourse
if
thou
wilt
or
but
we
have
not
time
for
annina
comes
seldom
and
i
know
not
why
but
she
seems
to
love
a
sick
room
little
as
she
never
stays
many
minutes
with
her
aunt
thou
have
said
or
i
might
go
on
my
errand
gessina
i
would
carlo
but
i
am
certain
we
should
be
recalled
by
my
impatient
cousin
i
can
wait
i
am
patient
when
with
thee
dearest
gessina
hist
is
my
cousin
step
thou
canst
go
in
while
she
spoke
a
small
bell
rang
and
the
bravo
withdrew
into
the
inner
room
like
one
accustomed
to
that
place
of
retreat
he
left
the
door
ajar
for
the
darkness
of
the
closet
sufficiently
concealed
his
person
in
the
meantime
gelsomina
opened
the
outer
door
for
the
admission
of
her
visitor
at
the
first
sound
of
the
latter
voice
jacopo
who
had
little
suspected
the
fact
from
a
name
which
was
so
common
recognised
the
artful
daughter
of
the
thou
art
at
thy
ease
here
gelsomina
cried
the
latter
entering
and
throwing
herself
into
a
seat
like
one
fatigued
thy
mother
is
better
and
thou
art
truly
mistress
of
the
house
i
would
i
were
not
annina
for
i
am
young
to
have
this
trust
with
this
affliction
it
is
not
so
insupportable
gessina
to
be
mistress
within
doors
at
seventeen
authority
is
sweet
and
obedience
is
odious
i
have
found
neither
so
and
i
will
give
up
the
first
with
joy
whenever
my
poor
mother
shall
be
able
to
take
command
of
her
own
family
again
this
is
well
gessina
and
does
credit
to
the
good
father
confessor
but
authority
is
dear
to
woman
and
so
is
liberty
thou
wast
not
with
the
maskers
yesterday
in
the
square
i
seldom
wear
a
disguise
and
i
could
not
quit
my
mother
which
means
that
thou
have
been
glad
to
do
it
thou
hast
a
good
reason
for
thy
regrets
since
a
gayer
marriage
of
the
sea
or
a
braver
regatta
has
not
been
witnessed
in
venice
since
thou
wast
born
but
the
first
was
to
be
seen
from
thy
window
i
saw
the
galley
of
state
sweeping
towards
the
lido
and
the
train
of
patricians
on
its
deck
but
little
else
no
matter
thou
shalt
have
as
good
an
idea
of
the
pageant
as
if
thou
played
the
part
of
the
doge
himself
first
came
the
men
of
the
guard
with
their
ancient
dresses
nay
this
i
remember
to
have
often
seen
for
the
same
show
is
kept
from
year
to
year
thou
art
right
but
venice
never
witnessed
such
a
brave
regatta
thou
knowest
that
the
first
trial
is
always
between
gondolas
of
many
oars
steered
by
the
best
esteemed
of
the
canals
luigi
was
there
and
though
he
did
not
win
he
more
than
merited
success
by
the
manner
in
which
he
directed
his
boat
thou
knowest
luigi
i
scarce
know
any
in
venice
annina
for
the
long
illness
of
my
mother
and
this
unhappy
office
of
my
father
keep
me
within
when
others
are
on
the
canals
true
thou
art
not
well
placed
to
make
acquaintances
but
luigi
is
second
to
no
gondolier
in
skill
or
reputation
and
he
is
much
the
merriest
rogue
of
them
all
that
put
foot
on
the
lido
he
was
foremost
then
in
the
grand
race
he
should
have
been
but
the
awkwardness
of
his
fellows
and
some
unfairness
in
the
crossing
threw
him
back
to
be
second
was
a
sight
to
behold
that
of
many
noble
watermen
struggling
to
maintain
or
to
get
a
name
on
the
canals
santa
maria
i
would
thou
have
seen
it
girl
i
should
not
have
been
glad
to
see
a
friend
defeated
we
must
take
fortune
as
it
offers
but
the
most
wonderful
sight
of
the
day
after
all
though
luigi
and
his
fellows
did
so
well
was
to
see
a
poor
fisherman
named
antonio
in
his
bare
head
and
naked
legs
a
man
of
seventy
years
and
with
a
boat
no
better
than
that
i
use
to
carry
liquors
to
the
lido
entering
on
the
second
race
and
carrying
off
the
prize
he
could
not
have
met
with
powerful
rivals
the
best
of
venice
though
luigi
having
strived
for
the
first
could
not
enter
for
the
second
trial
is
said
too
continued
annina
looking
about
her
with
habitual
caution
that
one
who
may
scarce
be
named
in
venice
had
the
boldness
to
appear
in
that
regatta
masked
and
yet
the
fisherman
won
thou
hast
heard
of
jacopo
the
name
is
common
there
is
but
one
who
bears
it
now
in
venice
all
mean
the
same
when
they
say
jacopo
i
have
heard
of
a
monster
of
that
name
surely
he
hath
not
dared
to
show
himself
among
the
nobles
on
such
a
festa
gessina
we
live
in
an
unaccountable
country
the
man
walks
the
piazza
with
a
step
as
lordly
as
the
doge
at
his
pleasure
and
yet
none
say
aught
to
him
i
have
seen
him
at
noonday
leaning
against
the
triumphal
mast
or
the
column
of
san
theodoro
with
as
proud
an
air
as
if
he
were
put
there
to
celebrate
a
victory
of
the
republic
perhaps
he
is
master
of
some
terrible
secret
which
they
fear
he
will
reveal
thou
knowest
little
of
venice
child
holy
maria
a
secret
of
that
kind
is
a
of
itself
it
is
as
dangerous
to
know
too
much
as
it
is
to
know
too
little
when
one
deals
with
mark
but
they
say
jacopo
was
there
standing
eye
to
eye
with
the
doge
and
scaring
the
senators
as
if
he
had
been
an
uncalled
spectre
from
the
vaults
of
their
fathers
nor
is
this
all
as
i
crossed
the
lagunes
this
morning
i
saw
the
body
of
a
young
cavalier
drawn
from
the
water
and
those
who
were
near
it
said
it
had
the
mark
of
his
fatal
hand
the
timid
gelsomina
shuddered
they
who
rule
she
said
will
have
to
answer
for
this
negligence
to
god
if
they
let
the
wretch
longer
go
at
large
blessed
mark
protect
his
children
they
say
there
is
much
of
this
sort
of
sin
to
answer
for
but
see
the
body
i
did
with
my
own
eyes
in
entering
the
canals
this
morning
and
didst
thou
sleep
on
the
lido
that
thou
wert
abroad
so
early
the
lido
yes
nay
i
slept
not
but
thou
knowest
my
father
had
a
busy
day
during
the
revels
and
i
am
not
like
thee
gessina
mistress
of
the
household
to
do
as
i
would
but
i
tarry
here
to
chat
with
thee
when
there
is
great
need
of
industry
at
home
hast
thou
the
package
child
which
i
trusted
to
thy
keeping
at
my
last
visit
it
is
here
answered
gelsomina
opening
a
drawer
and
handing
to
her
cousin
a
small
but
closely
enveloped
package
which
unknown
to
herself
contained
some
articles
of
forbidden
commerce
and
which
the
other
in
her
indefatigable
activity
had
been
obliged
to
secrete
for
a
time
i
had
begun
to
think
that
thou
hadst
forgotten
it
and
was
about
to
send
it
to
thee
gelsomina
if
thou
lovest
me
never
do
so
rash
an
act
my
brother
giuseppe
thou
scarce
knowest
giuseppe
we
have
little
acquaintance
for
cousins
thou
art
fortunate
in
thy
ignorance
i
can
not
say
what
i
might
of
the
child
of
the
same
parents
but
had
giuseppe
seen
this
package
by
any
accident
it
might
have
brought
thee
into
great
trouble
nay
i
fear
not
thy
brother
nor
any
else
said
the
daughter
of
the
with
the
firmness
of
innocence
he
could
do
me
no
harm
for
dealing
kindly
by
a
relative
thou
art
right
but
he
might
have
caused
me
great
vexation
sainted
maria
if
thou
knewest
the
pain
that
unthinking
and
misguided
boy
gives
his
family
he
is
my
brother
after
all
and
you
will
fancy
the
rest
addio
good
gessina
i
hope
thy
father
will
permit
thee
to
come
and
visit
at
last
those
who
so
much
love
thee
addio
annina
thou
knowest
i
would
come
gladly
but
that
i
scarce
quit
the
side
of
my
poor
mother
the
wily
daughter
of
the
gave
her
guileless
and
unsuspecting
friend
a
kiss
and
then
she
was
let
out
and
departed
carlo
said
the
soft
voice
of
gessina
thou
come
forth
for
we
have
no
further
fear
of
visits
the
bravo
appeared
but
with
a
paleness
deeper
than
common
on
his
cheek
he
looked
mournfully
at
the
gentle
and
affectionate
being
who
awaited
his
return
and
when
he
struggled
to
answer
her
ingenuous
smile
the
abortive
effort
gave
his
features
an
expression
of
ghastliness
annina
has
wearied
thee
with
her
idle
discourse
of
the
regatta
and
of
murders
on
the
canals
thou
wilt
not
judge
her
harshly
for
the
manner
in
which
she
spoke
of
giuseppe
who
may
deserve
this
and
more
but
i
know
thy
impatience
and
i
will
not
increase
thy
weariness
hold
gessina
this
girl
is
thy
cousin
have
i
not
told
thee
so
our
mothers
are
sisters
and
she
is
here
often
not
as
often
as
she
could
wish
i
am
certain
for
her
aunt
has
not
quitted
her
room
for
many
many
months
thou
art
an
excellent
daughter
kind
gessina
and
would
make
all
others
as
virtuous
as
thyself
and
thou
hast
been
to
return
these
visits
never
my
father
forbids
it
for
they
are
dealers
in
wines
and
entertain
the
gondoliers
in
revelry
but
annina
is
blameless
for
the
trade
of
her
parents
no
doubt
and
that
package
it
hath
been
long
in
thy
keeping
a
month
annina
left
it
at
her
last
visit
for
she
was
hurried
to
cross
to
the
lido
but
why
these
questions
you
do
not
like
my
cousin
who
is
giddy
and
given
to
idle
conversation
but
who
i
think
must
have
a
good
heart
thou
the
manner
in
which
she
spoke
of
the
wretched
bravo
jacopo
and
of
this
late
murder
i
did
thou
not
have
shown
more
horror
at
the
monster
crime
thyself
carlo
nay
annina
is
thoughtless
and
she
might
be
less
worldly
but
she
hath
like
all
of
us
a
holy
aversion
to
sin
shall
i
lead
thee
to
the
cell
go
on
thy
honest
nature
carlo
revolts
at
the
cold
villany
of
the
assassin
i
have
heard
much
of
his
murders
and
of
the
manner
in
which
those
up
above
bear
with
him
they
say
in
common
that
his
art
surpasseth
theirs
and
that
the
officers
wait
for
proof
that
they
may
not
do
injustice
is
the
senate
so
tender
think
you
asked
the
bravo
huskily
but
motioning
for
his
companion
to
proceed
the
girl
looked
sad
like
one
who
felt
the
force
of
this
question
and
she
turned
away
to
open
a
private
door
whence
she
brought
forth
a
little
box
this
is
the
key
carlo
she
said
showing
him
one
of
a
massive
bunch
and
i
am
now
the
sole
warder
this
much
at
least
we
have
effected
the
day
may
still
come
when
we
shall
do
more
the
bravo
endeavored
to
smile
as
if
he
appreciated
her
kindness
but
he
only
succeeded
in
making
her
understand
his
desire
to
go
on
the
eye
of
the
girl
lost
its
gleam
of
hope
in
an
expression
of
sorrow
and
she
obeyed
chapter
xix
but
let
us
to
the
roof
and
when
thou
hast
surveyed
the
sea
the
land
visit
the
narrow
cells
that
cluster
there
as
in
a
place
of
tombs
mark
place
we
shall
not
attempt
to
thread
the
vaulted
galleries
the
gloomy
corridors
and
all
the
apartments
through
which
the
keeper
daughter
led
her
companion
those
who
have
ever
entered
an
extensive
prison
will
require
no
description
to
revive
the
feeling
of
pain
which
it
excited
by
barred
windows
creaking
hinges
grating
bolts
and
all
those
other
signs
which
are
alike
the
means
and
evidence
of
incarceration
the
building
unhappily
like
most
other
edifices
intended
to
repress
the
vices
of
society
was
vast
strong
and
intricate
within
although
as
has
been
already
intimated
of
a
chaste
and
simple
beauty
externally
that
might
seem
to
have
been
adopted
in
mockery
of
its
destination
gelsomina
entered
a
low
narrow
and
glazed
gallery
when
she
stopped
thou
soughtest
me
as
wont
beneath
the
carlo
she
asked
at
the
usual
hour
i
should
not
have
entered
the
prison
had
i
found
thee
there
for
thou
knowest
i
would
be
little
seen
but
i
bethought
me
of
thy
mother
and
crossed
the
canal
thou
wast
wrong
my
mother
rests
much
as
she
has
done
for
many
months
thou
must
have
seen
that
we
are
not
taking
the
usual
route
to
the
cell
i
have
but
as
we
are
not
accustomed
to
meet
in
thy
father
rooms
on
this
errand
i
thought
this
the
necessary
direction
hast
thou
much
knowledge
of
the
palace
and
the
prison
carlo
more
than
i
could
wish
good
gelsomina
but
why
am
i
thus
questioned
at
a
moment
when
i
would
be
otherwise
employed
the
timid
and
conscious
girl
did
not
answer
her
cheek
was
never
bright
for
like
a
flower
reared
in
the
shade
it
had
the
delicate
hue
of
her
secluded
life
but
at
this
question
it
became
pale
accustomed
to
the
ingenuous
habits
of
the
sensitive
being
at
his
side
the
bravo
studied
her
speaking
features
intently
he
moved
swiftly
to
a
window
and
looking
out
his
eye
fell
upon
a
narrow
and
gloomy
canal
crossing
the
gallery
he
cast
a
glance
beneath
him
and
saw
the
same
dark
watery
passage
leading
between
the
masonry
of
two
massive
piles
to
the
quay
and
the
port
gelsomina
he
cried
recoiling
from
the
sight
this
is
the
bridge
of
sighs
it
is
carlo
hast
thou
ever
crossed
it
before
never
nor
do
i
understand
why
i
cross
it
now
i
have
long
thought
that
it
might
one
day
be
my
fortune
to
walk
this
fatal
passage
but
i
could
not
dream
of
such
a
keeper
the
eye
of
gelsomina
brightened
and
her
smile
was
cheerful
thou
wilt
never
cross
it
to
thy
harm
with
me
of
that
i
am
certain
kind
gessina
he
answered
taking
her
hand
but
this
is
a
riddle
that
i
can
not
explain
art
thou
in
the
habit
of
entering
the
palace
by
this
gallery
it
is
little
used
except
by
the
keepers
and
the
condemned
as
doubtless
thou
hast
often
heard
but
yet
they
have
given
me
the
keys
and
taught
me
the
windings
of
the
place
in
order
that
i
might
serve
as
usual
for
thy
guide
gelsomina
i
fear
i
have
been
too
happy
in
thy
company
to
note
as
prudence
would
have
told
me
the
rare
kindness
of
the
council
in
permitting
me
to
enjoy
it
dost
thou
repent
carlo
that
thou
hast
known
me
the
reproachful
melancholy
of
her
voice
touched
the
bravo
who
kissed
the
hand
he
held
with
italian
fervor
i
should
then
repent
me
of
the
only
hours
of
happiness
i
have
known
for
years
he
said
thou
hast
been
to
me
gelsomina
like
a
flower
in
a
desert
a
pure
spring
to
a
feverish
man
a
gleam
of
hope
to
one
suffering
under
malediction
no
no
not
for
a
moment
have
i
repented
knowing
thee
my
gelsomina
not
have
made
my
life
more
happy
carlo
to
have
thought
i
had
added
to
thy
sorrows
i
am
young
and
ignorant
of
the
world
but
i
know
we
should
cause
joy
and
not
pain
to
those
we
esteem
thy
nature
would
teach
thee
this
gentle
lesson
but
is
it
not
strange
that
one
like
me
should
be
suffered
to
visit
the
prison
unattended
by
any
other
keeper
i
had
not
thought
it
so
carlo
but
surely
it
is
not
common
we
have
found
so
much
pleasure
in
each
other
dear
gessina
that
we
have
overlooked
what
ought
to
have
caused
alarm
alarm
carlo
or
at
least
distrust
for
these
wily
senators
do
no
act
of
mercy
without
a
motive
but
it
is
now
too
late
to
recall
the
past
if
we
would
and
in
that
which
relates
to
thee
i
would
not
lose
the
memory
of
a
moment
let
us
proceed
the
slight
cloud
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
mild
auditor
of
the
bravo
but
still
she
did
not
move
few
pass
this
bridge
they
say
she
added
tremulously
and
enter
the
world
again
and
yet
thou
dost
not
even
ask
why
we
are
here
carlo
there
was
a
transient
gleam
of
distrust
in
the
hasty
glance
of
the
bravo
as
he
shot
a
look
at
the
undisturbed
eye
of
the
innocent
being
who
put
this
question
but
it
scarcely
remained
long
enough
to
change
the
expression
of
manly
interest
she
was
accustomed
to
meet
in
his
look
since
thou
wilt
have
me
curious
he
said
why
hast
thou
come
hither
and
more
than
all
being
here
why
dost
thou
linger
the
season
is
advanced
carlo
she
answered
speaking
scarcely
above
her
breath
and
we
should
look
in
vain
among
the
cells
i
understand
thee
he
said
we
will
proceed
gelsomina
lingered
to
gaze
wistfully
into
the
face
of
her
companion
but
finding
no
visible
sign
of
the
agony
he
endured
she
went
on
jacopo
spoke
hoarsely
but
he
was
too
long
accustomed
to
disguise
to
permit
the
weakness
to
escape
when
he
knew
how
much
it
would
pain
the
sensitive
and
faithful
being
who
had
yielded
her
affections
to
him
with
a
singleness
and
devotion
which
arose
nearly
as
much
from
her
manner
of
life
as
from
natural
ingenuousness
in
order
that
the
reader
may
be
enabled
to
understand
the
allusions
which
seem
to
be
so
plain
to
our
lovers
it
may
be
necessary
to
explain
another
odious
feature
in
the
policy
of
the
republic
of
venice
whatever
may
be
the
pretension
of
a
state
in
its
acknowledged
theories
an
unerring
clue
to
its
true
character
is
ever
to
be
found
in
the
machinery
of
its
practice
in
those
governments
which
are
created
for
the
good
of
the
people
force
is
applied
with
caution
and
reluctance
since
the
protection
and
not
the
injury
of
the
weak
is
their
object
whereas
the
more
selfish
and
exclusive
the
system
becomes
the
more
severe
and
ruthless
are
the
coercive
means
employed
by
those
in
power
thus
in
venice
whose
whole
political
fabric
reposed
on
the
narrow
foundation
of
an
oligarchy
the
jealousy
of
the
senate
brought
the
engines
of
despotism
in
absolute
contact
with
even
the
pageantry
of
their
titular
prince
and
the
palace
of
the
doge
himself
was
polluted
by
the
presence
of
the
dungeons
the
princely
edifice
had
its
summer
and
winter
cells
the
reader
may
be
ready
to
believe
that
mercy
had
dictated
some
slight
solace
for
the
miserable
in
this
arrangement
but
this
would
be
ascribing
pity
to
a
body
which
to
its
latest
moment
had
no
tie
to
subject
it
to
the
weakness
of
humanity
so
far
from
consulting
the
sufferings
of
the
captive
his
winter
cell
was
below
the
level
of
the
canals
while
his
summers
were
to
be
passed
beneath
the
leads
exposed
to
the
action
of
the
burning
sun
of
that
climate
as
the
reader
has
probably
anticipated
already
that
jacopo
was
in
the
prison
on
an
errand
connected
with
some
captive
this
short
explanation
will
enable
him
to
understand
the
secret
allusion
of
his
companion
he
they
sought
had
in
truth
been
recently
conveyed
from
the
damp
cells
where
he
had
passed
the
winter
and
spring
to
the
heated
chambers
beneath
the
roof
gelsomina
continued
to
lead
the
way
with
a
sadness
of
eye
and
feature
that
betrayed
her
strong
sympathy
with
the
sufferings
of
her
companion
but
without
appearing
to
think
further
delay
necessary
she
had
communicated
a
circumstance
which
weighed
heavily
on
her
own
mind
and
like
most
of
her
mild
temperament
who
had
dreaded
such
a
duty
now
that
it
was
discharged
she
experienced
a
sensible
relief
they
ascended
many
flights
of
steps
opened
and
shut
numberless
doors
and
threaded
several
narrow
corridors
in
silence
before
reaching
the
place
of
destination
while
gelsomina
sought
the
key
of
the
door
before
which
they
stopped
in
the
large
bunch
she
carried
the
bravo
breathed
the
hot
air
of
the
attic
like
one
who
was
suffocating
they
promised
me
that
this
should
not
be
done
again
he
said
but
they
forget
their
pledges
fiends
as
they
are
carlo
thou
forgettest
that
this
is
the
palace
of
the
doge
whispered
the
girl
while
she
threw
a
timid
glance
behind
her
i
forget
nothing
that
is
connected
with
the
republic
it
is
all
here
striking
his
flushed
brow
what
is
not
there
is
in
my
heart
poor
carlo
this
can
not
last
for
ever
there
will
be
an
end
thou
art
right
answered
the
bravo
hoarsely
the
end
is
nearer
than
thou
thinkest
no
matter
turn
the
key
that
we
may
go
in
the
hand
of
gelsomina
lingered
on
the
lock
but
admonished
by
his
impatient
eye
she
complied
and
they
entered
the
cell
father
exclaimed
the
bravo
hastening
to
the
side
of
a
pallet
that
lay
on
the
floor
the
attenuated
and
feeble
form
of
an
old
man
rose
at
the
word
and
an
eye
which
while
it
spoke
mental
feebleness
was
at
that
moment
even
brighter
than
that
of
his
son
glared
on
the
faces
of
gelsomina
and
her
companion
thou
hast
not
suffered
as
i
had
feared
by
this
sudden
change
father
continued
the
latter
kneeling
by
the
side
of
the
straw
thine
eye
and
cheek
and
countenance
are
better
than
in
the
damp
caves
below
i
am
happy
here
returned
the
prisoner
there
is
light
and
though
they
have
given
me
too
much
of
it
thou
canst
never
know
my
boy
the
joy
of
looking
at
the
day
after
so
long
a
night
he
is
better
gelsomina
they
have
not
yet
destroyed
him
see
his
eye
is
bright
even
and
his
cheek
has
a
glow
they
are
ever
so
after
passing
the
winter
in
the
lower
dungeons
whispered
the
gentle
girl
hast
thou
news
for
me
boy
what
tidings
from
thy
mother
jacopo
bowed
his
head
to
conceal
the
anguish
occasioned
by
this
question
which
he
now
heard
for
the
hundredth
time
she
is
happy
father
happy
as
one
can
be
who
so
well
loves
thee
when
away
from
thy
side
does
she
speak
of
me
often
the
last
word
that
i
heard
from
her
lips
was
thy
name
holy
maria
bless
her
i
trust
she
remembers
me
in
her
prayers
doubt
it
not
father
they
are
the
prayers
of
an
angel
and
thy
patient
sister
thou
hast
not
named
her
son
she
too
is
well
father
has
she
ceased
to
blame
herself
for
being
the
innocent
cause
of
my
sufferings
she
has
then
she
pines
no
longer
over
a
blow
that
can
not
be
helped
the
bravo
seemed
to
search
for
relief
in
the
sympathizing
eye
of
the
pale
and
speechless
gelsomina
she
has
ceased
to
pine
father
he
uttered
with
compelled
calmness
thou
hast
ever
loved
thy
sister
boy
with
manly
tenderness
thy
heart
is
kind
as
i
have
reason
to
know
if
god
has
given
me
grief
he
has
blessed
me
in
my
children
a
long
pause
followed
during
which
the
parent
seemed
to
muse
on
the
past
while
the
child
rejoiced
in
the
suspension
of
questions
which
harrowed
his
soul
since
those
of
whom
the
other
spoke
had
long
been
the
victims
of
family
misfortune
the
old
man
for
the
prisoner
was
aged
as
well
as
feeble
turned
his
look
on
the
still
kneeling
bravo
thoughtfully
and
continued
there
is
little
hope
of
thy
sister
marrying
for
none
are
fond
of
tying
themselves
to
the
proscribed
she
wishes
it
not
she
wishes
it
not
she
is
happy
with
my
mother
it
is
a
happiness
the
republic
will
not
begrudge
is
there
no
hope
of
our
being
able
to
meet
soon
thou
wilt
meet
my
mother
yes
that
pleasure
will
come
at
last
it
is
a
weary
time
since
any
of
my
blood
but
thee
have
stood
in
my
sight
kneel
that
i
may
bless
thee
jacopo
who
had
risen
under
his
mental
torture
obeyed
and
bowed
his
head
in
reverence
to
receive
the
paternal
benediction
the
lips
of
the
old
man
moved
and
his
eyes
were
turned
to
heaven
but
his
language
was
of
the
heart
rather
than
that
of
the
tongue
gelsomina
bent
her
head
to
her
bosom
and
seemed
to
unite
her
prayers
to
those
of
the
prisoner
when
the
silent
but
solemn
ceremony
was
ended
each
made
the
customary
sign
of
the
cross
and
jacopo
kissed
the
wrinkled
hand
of
the
captive
hast
thou
hope
for
me
the
old
man
asked
this
pious
and
grateful
duty
done
do
they
still
promise
to
let
me
look
upon
the
sun
again
they
do
they
promise
fair
would
that
their
words
were
true
i
have
lived
on
hope
for
a
weary
time
i
have
now
been
within
these
walls
more
than
four
years
methinks
jacopo
did
not
answer
for
he
knew
that
his
father
named
the
period
only
that
he
himself
had
been
permitted
to
see
him
i
built
upon
the
expectation
that
the
doge
would
remember
his
ancient
servant
and
open
my
still
jacopo
was
silent
for
the
doge
of
whom
the
other
spoke
had
long
been
dead
and
yet
i
should
be
grateful
for
maria
and
the
saints
have
not
forgotten
me
i
am
not
without
my
pleasures
in
captivity
god
be
praised
returned
the
bravo
in
what
manner
dost
thou
ease
thy
sorrows
father
look
hither
boy
exclaimed
the
old
man
whose
eye
betrayed
a
mixture
of
feverish
excitement
caused
by
the
recent
change
in
his
prison
and
the
growing
imbecility
of
a
mind
that
was
gradually
losing
its
powers
for
want
of
use
dost
thou
see
the
rent
in
that
bit
of
wood
it
opens
with
the
heat
from
time
to
time
and
since
i
have
been
an
inhabitant
here
that
fissure
has
doubled
in
length
i
sometimes
fancy
that
when
it
reaches
the
knot
the
hearts
of
the
senators
will
soften
and
that
my
doors
will
open
there
is
a
satisfaction
in
watching
its
increase
as
it
lengthens
inch
by
inch
year
after
year
is
this
all
nay
i
have
other
pleasures
there
was
a
spider
the
past
year
that
wove
his
web
from
yonder
beam
and
he
was
a
companion
too
that
i
loved
to
see
wilt
thou
look
boy
if
there
is
hope
of
his
coming
back
i
see
him
not
whispered
the
bravo
well
there
is
always
the
hope
of
his
return
the
flies
will
enter
soon
and
then
he
will
be
looking
for
his
prey
they
may
shut
me
up
on
a
false
charge
and
keep
me
weary
years
from
my
wife
and
daughter
but
they
can
not
rob
me
of
all
my
happiness
the
aged
captive
was
mute
and
thoughtful
a
childish
impatience
glowed
in
his
eye
and
he
gazed
from
the
rent
the
companion
of
so
many
solitary
summers
to
the
face
of
his
son
like
one
who
began
to
distrust
his
enjoyments
well
let
them
take
it
away
he
said
burying
his
head
beneath
the
covering
of
his
bed
i
will
not
curse
them
father
the
prisoner
made
no
reply
father
jacopo
in
his
turn
the
bravo
was
speechless
he
did
not
venture
even
to
steal
a
glance
towards
the
breathless
and
attentive
gelsomina
though
his
bosom
heaved
with
longing
to
examine
her
guileless
features
dost
thou
hear
me
son
continued
the
prisoner
uncovering
his
head
dost
thou
really
think
they
will
have
the
heart
to
chase
the
spider
from
my
cell
they
will
leave
thee
this
pleasure
father
for
it
touches
neither
their
power
nor
their
fame
so
long
as
the
senate
can
keep
its
foot
on
the
neck
of
the
people
and
so
long
as
it
can
keep
the
seemliness
of
a
good
name
it
will
not
envy
thee
this
blessed
maria
make
me
thankful
i
had
my
fears
child
for
it
is
not
pleasant
to
lose
any
friend
in
a
cell
jacopo
then
proceeded
to
soothe
the
mind
of
the
prisoner
and
he
gradually
led
his
thoughts
to
other
subjects
he
laid
by
the
a
few
articles
of
food
that
he
was
allowed
to
bring
with
him
and
again
holding
out
the
hope
of
eventual
liberation
he
proposed
to
take
his
leave
i
will
try
to
believe
thee
son
said
the
old
man
who
had
good
reason
to
distrust
assurances
so
often
made
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
believe
it
thou
wilt
tell
thy
mother
that
i
never
cease
to
think
of
her
and
to
pray
for
her
and
thou
wilt
bless
thy
sister
in
the
name
of
her
poor
imprisoned
parent
the
bravo
bowed
in
acquiescence
glad
of
any
means
to
escape
speech
at
a
sign
from
the
old
man
he
again
bent
his
knee
and
received
the
parting
benediction
after
busying
himself
in
arranging
the
scanty
furniture
of
the
cell
and
in
trying
to
open
one
or
two
small
fissures
with
a
view
to
admit
more
light
and
air
he
quitted
the
place
neither
gelsomina
nor
jacopo
spoke
as
they
returned
by
the
intricate
passages
through
which
they
had
ascended
to
the
attic
until
they
were
again
on
the
bridge
of
sighs
it
was
seldom
that
human
foot
trod
this
gallery
and
the
former
with
female
quickness
selected
it
as
a
place
suited
to
their
further
conference
dost
thou
find
him
changed
she
asked
lingering
on
the
arch
much
thou
speakest
with
a
frightful
meaning
i
have
not
taught
my
countenance
to
lie
to
thee
gelsomina
but
there
is
thou
him
there
was
hope
thyself
blessed
maria
forgive
the
fraud
i
could
not
rob
the
little
life
he
has
of
its
only
comfort
carlo
carlo
why
art
thou
so
calm
i
have
never
heard
thee
speak
so
calmly
of
thy
father
wrongs
and
imprisonment
it
is
because
his
liberation
is
near
but
this
moment
he
was
without
hope
and
thou
speakest
now
of
liberation
the
liberation
of
death
even
the
anger
of
the
senate
will
respect
the
grave
dost
thou
think
his
end
near
i
had
not
seen
this
change
thou
art
kind
good
gelsomina
and
true
to
thy
friends
and
without
suspicion
of
those
crimes
of
which
thou
art
so
innocent
but
to
one
who
has
seen
as
much
evil
as
i
a
jealous
thought
comes
at
every
new
event
the
sufferings
of
my
poor
father
are
near
their
end
for
nature
is
worn
out
but
were
it
not
i
can
foresee
that
means
would
be
found
to
bring
them
to
a
close
thou
not
suspect
that
any
here
would
do
him
harm
i
suspect
none
that
belong
to
thee
both
thy
father
and
thyself
gelsomina
are
placed
here
by
the
interposition
of
the
saints
that
the
fiends
should
not
have
too
much
power
on
earth
i
do
not
understand
thee
carlo
but
thou
art
often
thy
father
used
a
word
that
i
could
wish
he
had
not
in
speaking
to
thee
the
eye
of
the
bravo
threw
a
quick
uneasy
suspicious
glance
at
his
companion
and
then
averted
its
look
with
haste
he
called
thee
jacopo
continued
the
girl
men
often
have
glimpses
of
their
fate
by
the
kindness
of
their
patrons
thou
say
carlo
that
thy
father
suspects
the
senate
will
employ
the
monster
he
named
why
not
they
have
employed
worse
men
if
report
says
true
he
is
not
unknown
to
them
can
this
be
so
thou
art
bitter
against
the
republic
because
it
has
done
injury
to
thy
family
but
thou
canst
not
believe
it
has
ever
dealt
with
the
hired
stiletto
i
said
no
more
than
is
whispered
daily
on
the
canals
i
would
thy
father
had
not
called
thee
by
this
terrible
name
carlo
thou
art
too
wise
to
be
moved
by
a
word
gelsomina
but
what
thinkest
thou
of
my
unhappy
father
this
visit
has
not
been
like
the
others
thou
hast
made
him
in
my
company
i
know
not
the
reason
but
to
me
thou
hast
ever
seemed
to
feel
the
hope
with
which
thou
hast
cheered
the
prisoner
while
now
thou
seemest
to
have
even
a
frightful
pleasure
in
despair
thy
fears
deceive
thee
returned
the
bravo
scarce
speaking
above
his
breath
thy
fears
deceive
thee
and
we
will
say
no
more
the
senate
mean
to
do
us
justice
at
last
they
are
honorable
signori
of
illustrious
birth
and
renowned
names
be
madness
to
distrust
the
patricians
dost
thou
not
know
girl
that
he
who
is
born
of
gentle
blood
is
above
the
weaknesses
and
temptations
that
beset
us
of
base
origin
they
are
men
placed
by
birth
above
the
weaknesses
of
mortals
and
owing
their
account
to
none
they
will
be
sure
to
do
justice
this
is
reasonable
and
who
can
doubt
it
as
he
ended
the
bravo
laughed
bitterly
nay
now
thou
triflest
with
me
carlo
none
are
above
the
danger
of
doing
wrong
but
those
whom
the
saints
and
kind
maria
favor
this
comes
of
living
in
a
prison
and
of
saying
thy
prayers
night
and
morning
no
no
silly
girl
there
are
men
in
the
world
born
wise
from
generation
to
generation
born
honest
virtuous
brave
incorruptible
and
fit
in
all
things
to
shut
up
and
imprison
those
who
are
born
base

where
hast
thou
passed
thy
days
foolish

not
to
have
felt
this
truth
in
the
very
air
thou
breathest
is
clear
as
the
sun
light
and
palpable
aye
palpable
as
these
prison
walls
the
timid
girl
recoiled
from
his
side
and
there
was
a
moment
when
she
meditated
flight
for
never
before
during
their
numberless
and
confidential
interviews
had
she
ever
heard
so
bitter
a
laugh
or
seen
so
wild
a
gleam
in
the
eye
of
her
companion
i
could
almost
fancy
carlo
that
my
father
was
right
in
using
the
name
he
did
she
said
as
recovering
herself
she
turned
a
reproachful
look
on
his
still
excited
features
it
is
the
business
of
parents
to
name
their
children
but
enough
i
must
leave
thee
good
gelsomina
and
i
leave
thee
with
a
heavy
heart
the
unsuspecting
gelsomina
forgot
her
alarm
she
knew
not
why
but
though
the
imaginary
carlo
seldom
quitted
her
that
she
was
not
sad
she
felt
a
weight
heavier
than
common
on
her
spirits
at
this
declaration
thou
hast
thy
affairs

they
must
not
be
forgotten
art

throws
the
whole

of

venerable
prisoner
on
my
toil
i
have
little
as
thou
knowest
carlo
said
gelsomina
in
a
voice
but
it
is
thine
my
father
is
not
rich
as
thou
feel
or
he
would
not
live
on
the
sufferings
of
others
by
holding
the
keys
of
the
prison
he
is
better
employed
than
those

set
the

the
choice
given

to
wear
the
horned
bonnet
to
feast
in
their

to
rest
in

to
be
the
gayest
bauble
in
such
a
pageant
as
that
of
yesterday
to
plot
in
their
secret
councils
and
to
be
the
heartless
judge
to
condemn
my
fellows
to
this
misery
or
to
be
merely
the
keeper
of
the
keys
and
turner
of
the
bolts
i
should
seize
on
the
latter
office
as
not
only
the
most
innocent
but
by
far
the
most
honorable
thou
dost
not
judge
as
the

i
had
feared
thou
feel
shame
at
being
the
husband
of
a
jailor
daughter
nay
i
will
not
hide
the
secret
longer
since
thou
speakest
so
calmly
i
have
wept
that
it
should
be
so
then
thou
hast
neither
understood
the

nor
me
were
thy
father

could
the
grievous
fact
be
known
thou
have
cause
to
sorrow
but
gelsomina
the
canals
are
getting
dusky
and
i
must
leave
thee
the
reluctant
girl
saw
the
truth
of
what
he
said
and
applying
a
key
she
opened
the
door
of
the
covered
bridge
a
few
turnings
and
a
short
descent
brought
the
bravo
and
his
companion
to
the
level
of
the
quays
here
the
former
took
a
hurried
leave
and
quitted

the
hour
had
come
for
the
revels
of
the
piazza
and
for
the
movement
of
the
gondolas
maskers
glided
along
the
porticoes
as
usual
the
song
and
cry
were
heard
anew
and
venice
was
again
absorbed
in
delusive
gaiety
when
jacopo
issued
from
the
prison
on
the
quay
he
mingled
with
the
stream
of
human
beings
that
was
setting
towards
the
squares
protected
from
observation
by
the
privileged
mask
while
crossing
the
lower
bridge
of
the
canal
of
mark
he
lingered
an
instant
to
throw
a
look
at
the
glazed
gallery
he
had
just
quitted
and
then
moved
forward
with
the
crowd
the
image
of
the
artless
and
confiding
gelsomina
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
as
he
passed
slowly
along
the
gloomy
arches
of
the
broglio
his
eye
sought
the
person
of
don
camillo
monforte
they
met
at
the
angle
of
the
little
square
and
exchanging
secret
signs
the
bravo
moved
on
unnoticed
hundreds
of
boats
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
piazzetta
among
these
jacopo
sought
his
own
gondola
which
he
extricated
from
the
floating
mass
and
urged
into
the
stream
a
few
sweeps
of
the
oar
and
he
lay
at
the
side
of
la
bella
sorrentina
the
padrone
paced
the
deck
enjoying
the
cool
of
the
evening
with
italian
indolence
while
his
people
grouped
on
the
forecastle
sang
or
rather
chanted
a
song
of
those
seas
the
greetings
were
blunt
and
brief
as
is
usual
among
men
of
that
class
but
the
padrone
appeared
to
expect
the
visit
for
he
led
his
guest
far
from
the
ears
of
his
crew
to
the
other
extremity
of
the
felucca
hast
thou
aught
in
particular
good
roderigo
demanded
the
mariner
who
knew
the
bravo
by
a
sign
and
yet
who
only
knew
him
by
that
fictitious
name
thou
seest
we
have
not
passed
the
time
idly
though
yesterday
was
a
festa
art
thou
ready
for
the
gulf
for
the
levant
or
the
pillars
of
hercules
as
shall
please
the
senate
we
have
got
our
yard
aloft
since
the
sun
went
behind
the
mountains
and
though
we
may
seem
careless
of
delay
an
hour
notice
will
fit
us
for
the
outside
of
the
lido
then
take
the
notice
master
roderigo
you
bring
your
news
to
an
overstocked
market
i
have
already
been
informed
that
we
shall
be
wanted
the
quick
movement
of
suspicion
made
by
the
bravo
escaped
the
observation
of
the
padrone
whose
eye
was
running
over
the
gear
with
a
sailor
habitual
attention
to
that
part
of
his
vessel
when
there
was
question
of
its
service
thou
art
right
stefano
but
there
is
little
harm
in
repeated
caution
preparation
is
the
first
duty
in
a
delicate
commission
will
you
look
for
yourself
signor
roderigo
said
the
mariner
in
a
lower
tone
la
bella
sorrentina
is
not
the
bucentaur
nor
a
galley
of
the
grand
master
of
malta
but
for
her
size
better
rooms
are
not
to
be
had
in
the
palace
of
the
doge
when
they
told
me
there
was
a
lady
in
the
freight
the
honor
of
calabria
was
stirred
in
her
behalf
is
well
if
they
have
named
to
thee
all
the
particulars
thou
wilt
not
fail
to
do
thyself
credit
i
do
not
say
that
they
have
shown
me
half
of
them
good
signore
interrupted
stefano
the
secresy
of
your
venetian
shipments
is
my
greatest
objection
to
the
trade
it
has
more
than
once
happened
to
me
that
i
have
lain
weeks
in
the
canals
with
my
hold
as
clean
as
a
friar
conscience
when
orders
have
come
to
weigh
with
some
such
cargo
as
a
messenger
who
has
got
into
his
berth
as
we
cleared
the
port
to
get
out
of
it
on
the
coast
of
dalmatia
or
among
the
greek
islands
in
such
cases
thou
hast
earned
thy
money
easily
diamine
master
roderigo
if
i
had
a
friend
in
venice
to
give
timely
advice
the
felucca
might
be
ballasted
with
articles
that
would
bring
a
profit
on
the
other
shore
of
what
concern
is
it
to
the
senate
when
i
do
my
duty
to
the
nobles
faithfully
that
i
do
my
duty
at
the
same
time
to
the
good
woman
and
her
little
brown
children
left
at
home
in
calabria
there
is
much
reason
in
what
thou
sayest
stefano
but
thou
knowest
the
republic
is
a
hard
master
an
affair
of
this
nature
must
be
touched
with
a
gentle
hand
none
know
it
better
than
i
for
when
they
sent
the
trader
with
all
his
movables
out
of
the
city
i
was
obliged
to
throw
certain
casks
into
the
sea
to
make
room
for
his
worthless
stuffs
the
senate
owes
me
just
compensation
for
that
loss
worthy
signor
roderigo
which
thou
be
glad
to
repair

you
may
be
the
doge
himself
signore
for
anything
i
know
of
your
countenance
but
i
could
swear
at
the
altar
you
ought
to
be
of
the
senate
for
your
sagacity
if
this
lady
will
not
be
burdened
with
many
effects
and
there
is
yet
time
i
might
humor
the
tastes
of
the

with
certain
of
the
articles
that
come
from
the
countries
beyond
the

thou
art
the
judge
of
the
probability
thyself
since
they
told
thee
of
the
nature
of
thy
errand

gennaro
of

open
my
eyes
they
said
not
a
word
beyond
this
little
fact
that
a
youthful
lady
in
whom
the
senate
had
great
interest
would
quit
the
city
this
night
for
the
eastern
coast
if
it
is
at
all
agreeable
to
your
conscience
master
roderigo
i
should
be
happy
to
hear
who
are
to
be
her
companions
of
that
thou
shalt
hear
more
in
proper
season
in
the
meantime
i
would
recommend
to
thee
a
cautious
tongue
for
mark
makes
no
idle
jokes
with
those
who
offend
him
i
am
glad
to
see
thee
in
this
state
of
preparation
worthy
padrone
and
wishing
thee
a
happy
night
and
a
prosperous
voyage
i
commit
thee
to
thy
patron
but

ere
i
quit
thee
i
would
know
the
hour
that
the
will

you
are
exact
as
a
compass
in
your
own
matters
signore
but
of
little
charity
to
thy
friends
with
the
burning
sun
of
we
should
have
the
air
of
the
alps
about
the
turn
of
the
night
is
well
my
eye
shall
be
on
thee
once
more
addio
cospetto
and
thou
hast
said
nothing
of
the
cargo
not
be
so
weighty
in
bulk
as
in
value
carelessly
answered
jacopo
shoving
his
gondola
from
the
side
of
the
felucca
the
fall
of
his
oar
into
the
water
succeeded
and
as
stefano
stood
meditating
the
chances
of
his
speculation
on
his
deck
the
boat
glided
away
towards
the
quay
with
a
swift
but
easy
movement
deceit
like
the
windings
of
that
subtle
animal
the
fox
often
crosses
its
own
path
it
consequently
throws
out
those
by
whom
it
is
practised
as
well
as
those
who
art
meant
to
be
its
victims
when
jacopo
parted
from
don
camillo
it
was
with
an
understanding
that
he
should
adopt
all
the
means
that
his
native
sagacity
or
his
experience
might
suggest
to
ascertain
in
what
manner
the
council
intended
to
dispose
of
the
person
of
donna
yioletta
they
had
separated
on
the
lido
and
as
none
knew
of
their
interview
but
him
and
none
would
probably
suspect
their
recent
alliance
the
bravo
entered
on
his
new
duty
with
some
chances
of
success
that
might
otherwise
have
been
lost
a
change
of
its
agents
in
affairs
of
peculiar
delicacy
was
one
of
the
ordinary
means
taken
by
the
republic
to
avoid
investigation
jacopo
had
often
been
its
instrument
in
negotiating
with
the
mariner
who
as
has
been
so
plainly
intimated
had
frequently
been
engaged
in
carrying
into
effect
its
secret
and
perhaps
justifiable
measures
of
police
but
in
no
instance
had
it
ever
been
found
necessary
to
interpose
a
second
agent
between
the
commencement
and
the
consummation
of
its
bargains
except
in
this
he
had
been
ordered
to
see
the
padrone
and
to
keep
him
in
preparation
for
immediate
service
but
since
the
examination
of
antonio
before
the
council
his
employers
had
neglected
to
give
him
any
further
instructions
the
danger
of
leaving
the
bride
within
reach
of
the
agents
of
don
camillo
was
so
obvious
that
this
unusual
caution
had
been
considered
necessary
it
was
under
this
disadvantage
therefore
that
jacopo
entered
on
the
discharge
of
his
new
and
important
duties
that
cunning
as
has
just
been
observed
is
apt
to
overreach
itself
has
passed
into
a
proverb
and
the
case
of
jacopo
and
his
employers
was
one
in
point
to
prove
its
truth
the
unusual
silence
of
those
who
ordinarily
sought
him
on
similar
occasions
had
not
been
lost
on
the
agent
and
the
sight
of
the
felucca
as
he
strayed
along
the
quays
gave
an
accidental
direction
to
his
inquiries
the
manner
in
which
they
were
aided
by
the
cupidity
of
the
calabrian
has
just
been
related
jacopo
had
no
sooner
touched
the
quay
and
secured
his
boat
than
he
hastened
again
to
the
broglio
it
was
now
filled
by
maskers
and
the
idlers
of
the
piazzetta
the
patricians
had
withdrawn
to
the
scenes
of
their
own
pleasures
or
in
furtherance
of
that
system
of
mysterious
sway
which
it
was
their
policy
to
maintain
they
did
not
choose
to
remain
exposed
to
the
common
eye
during
the
hours
of
license
which
were
about
to
follow
it
would
seem
that
jacopo
had
his
instructions
for
no
sooner
did
he
make
sure
that
don
camillo
had
retired
than
he
threaded
the
throng
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
course
was
decided
by
this
time
both
the
squares
were
full
and
at
least
half
of
those
who
spent
the
night
in
those
places
of
amusement
were
masked
the
step
of
the
bravo
though
so
unhesitating
was
leisurely
and
he
found
time
in
passing
up
the
piazzetta
to
examine
the
forms
and
when
circumstances
permitted
the
features
of
all
he
met
he
proceeded
in
this
manner
to
the
point
of
junction
between
the
two
squares
when
his
elbow
was
touched
by
a
light
hand
jacopo
was
not
accustomed
unnecessarily
to
trust
his
voice
in
the
square
of
mark
and
at
that
hour
but
his
look
of
inquiry
was
returned
by
a
sign
to
follow
he
had
been
stopped
by
one
whose
figure
was
so
completely
concealed
by
a
domino
as
to
baffle
all
conjecture
concerning
his
true
character
perceiving
however
that
the
other
wished
to
lead
him
to
a
part
of
the
square
that
was
vacant
and
which
was
directly
on
the
course
he
was
about
to
pursue
the
bravo
made
a
gesture
of
compliance
and
followed
no
sooner
were
the
two
apart
from
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
and
in
a
place
where
no
could
overhear
their
discourse
without
detection
than
the
stranger
stopped
he
appeared
to
examine
the
person
stature
and
dress
of
jacopo
from
beneath
his
mask
with
singular
caution
closing
the
whole
with
a
sign
that
meant
recognition
jacopo
returned
his
dumb
show
but
maintained
a
rigid
silence
just
daniel
muttered
the
stranger
when
he
found
that
his
companion
was
not
disposed
to
speak
one
would
think
illustrious
signore
that
your
confessor
had
imposed
a
penance
of
silence
by
the
manner
in
which
you
refuse
to
speak
to
your
servant
what
thou
here
am
i
sent
into
the
piazza
among
knights
of
industry
valets
gondoliers
and
all
other
manner
of
revellers
that
adorn
this
christian
land
in
search
of
the
heir
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
honorable
houses
of

how
knowest
thou
i
am
he
thou
seekest
signore
there
are
many
signs
seen
by
a
wise
man
that
escape
the
unobservant
when
young
cavaliers
have
a
taste
for
mingling
with
the
people
in
honorable
disguise
as
in
the
case
of
a
certain
patrician
of
this
republic
they
are
to
be
known
by
their
air
if
not
by
their
voices
thou
art
a
cunning
agent
hosea
but
the
shrewdness
of
thy
race
is
its
livelihood
it
is
its
sole
defence
against
the
wrongs
of
the
oppressor
young
noble
we
are
hunted
like
wolves
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
we
sometimes
show
the
ferocity
of
the
beasts
yon
take
us
for
but
why
should
i
tell
the
wrongs
of
my
people
to
one
who
believes
life
is
a
masquerade
and
who
would
not
be
sorry
ingenious
hosea
were
it
composed
only
of
hebrews
but
thy
errand
i
have
no
gage
unredeemed
nor
do
i
know
that
i
owe
thee
gold
righteous
samuel
your
cavaliers
of
the
senate
are
not
always
mindful
of
the
past
signore
or
these
are
words
that
might
have
been
spared
if
your
excellency
is
inclined
to
forget
pledges
the
fault
is
not
of
my
seeking
but
as
for
the
account
that
has
been
so
long
growing
between
us
there
is
not
a
dealer
on
the
rialto
that
will
dispute
the
proofs
well
be
it
so
thou
dun
my
father
son
in
the
face
of
the
revellers
in

i
would
do
no
discredit
to
any
come
of
that
illustrious
race
signore
and
therefore
we
will
say
no
more
of
the
matter
always
relying
that
at
the
proper
moment
you
will
not
question
your
own
hand
and
seal
i
like
thy
prudence
hebrew
it
is
a
pledge
thou
comest
on
some
errand
less
ungracious
than
common
as
i
am
pressed
for
time
be
a
favor
wert
thou
to
name
it
hosea
examined
in
a
covert
but
very
thorough
manner
the
vacant
spot
around
them
and
drawing
nearer
to
the
supposed
noble
he
continued
signore
your
family
is
in
danger
of
meeting
with
a
great
loss
it
is
known
to
you
that
the
senate
has
altogether
and
suddenly
removed
donna
violetta
from
the
keeping
of
the
faithful
and
illustrious
senator
your
father
though
jacopo
started
slightly
the
movement
was
so
natural
for
a
disappointed
lover
that
it
rather
aided
than
endangered
his
disguise
compose
yourself
young
signore
continued
hosea
these
disappointments
attend
us
all
in
youth
as
i
know
by
severe
trials
leah
was
not
gained
without
trouble
and
next
to
success
in
barter
success
in
love
is
perhaps
the
most
uncertain
gold
is
a
great
in
both
and
it
commonly
prevails
but
you
are
nearer
to
losing
the
lady
of
your
love
and
her
possessions
than
you
may
imagine
for
i
am
sent
expressly
to
say
that
she
is
about
to
be
removed
from
the
city
whither
demanded
jacopo
so
quickly
as
to
do
credit
to
his
assumed
character
that
is
the
point
to
learn
signore
thy
father
is
a
sagacious
senator
and
is
deep
at
times
in
the
secrets
of
the
state
but
judging
from
his
uncertainty
on
this
occasion
i
think
he
is
guided
more
by
his
calculations
than
by
any
assurance
of
his
own
knowledge
just
daniel
i
have
seen
the
moments
when
i
have
suspected
that
the
venerable
patrician
himself
was
a
member
of
the
council
of
three
his
house
is
ancient
and
his
privileges
well
established
why
should
he
not
i
say
naught
against
it
signore
it
is
a
wise
body
that
doeth
much
good
and
preventeth
much
harm
none
speak
evil
of
the
secret
councils
on
the
rialto
where
men
are
more
given
to
gainful
industry
that
to
wild
discussions
of
their
rulers
acts
but
signore
be
he
of
this
or
that
council
or
merely
of
the
senate
a
heedful
hint
has
fallen
from
his
lips
of
the
danger
we
are
in
of
losing
we
hast
thou
thoughts
of
donna
violetta
hosea
leah
and
the
law
forbid
if
the
comely
queen
of
sheba
herself
were
to
tempt
me
and
a
frail
nature
showed
signs
of
weakness
i
doubt
that
our
rabbis
would
find
reasons
for
teaching
besides
the
daughter
of
levi
is
no
favorer
of
polygamy
nor
any
other
of
our
privileges
i
spoke
in
pluralities
signore
because
the
rialto
has
some
stake
in
this
marriage
as
well
as
the
house
of
gradenigo
i
understand
thee
thou
hast
fears
for
thy
gold
had
i
been
easily
alarmed
signor
giacomo
in
that
particular
i
might
not
have
parted
with
it
so
readily
but
though
the
succession
of
thy
illustrious
father
will
be
ample
to
meet
any
loan
within
my
humble
means
that
of
the
late
signor
tiepolo
will
not
weaken
the
security
i
admit
thy
sagacity
and
feel
the
importance
of
thy
warning
but
it
seems
to
have
no
other
object
or
warranty
than
thy
own
fears
with
certain
obscure
hints
from
your
honored
father
signore
did
he
say
more
to
the
point
he
spoke
in
parables
young
noble
but
having
an
oriental
ear
his
words
were
not
uttered
to
the
wind
that
the
rich
damsel
is
about
to
be
conveyed
from
venice
am
i
certain
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
little
stake
i
have
myself
in
her
movements
i
would
give
the
best
turquoise
in
my
shop
to
know
whither
canst
thou
say
with
certainty
be
this
night
giving
no
pledge
for
redemption
in
the
event
of
mistake
i
am
so
sure
young
cavalier
as
to
have
many
unquiet
thoughts
enough
i
will
look
to
my
own
interests
and
to
thine
jacopo
waved
his
hand
in
adieu
and
pursued
his
walk
up
the
piazza
had
i
looked
more
sharply
to
the
latter
as
became
one
accustomed
to
deal
with
the
accursed
race
muttered
the
hebrew
it
would
be
a
matter
of
no
concern
to
me
if
the
girl
married
a
turk
hosea
said
a
mask
at
his
ear
a
word
with
thee
in
secret
the
jeweller
started
and
found
that
in
his
zeal
he
had
suffered
one
to
approach
within
sound
of
his
voice
unseen
the
other
was
in
a
domino
also
and
so
well
enveloped
as
to
be
effectually
concealed
what
thou
signor
mask
demanded
the
wary
jew
a
word
in
friendship
and
in
thou
hast
moneys
to
lend
at
usury
the
question
had
better
be
put
to
the
republic
treasury
i
have
many
stones
valued
much
below
their
weight
and
would
be
glad
to
put
them
with
some
one
more
lucky
than
myself
who
will
be
able
to
keep
them
nay
this
will
not
suffice
thou
art
known
to
be
abounding
in
sequins
one
of
thy
race
and
riches
will
never
refuse
a
sure
loan
with
securities
as
certain
as
the
laws
of
venice
a
thousand
ducats
in
thy
willing
hand
is
no
novelty
they
who
call
me
rich
signor
mask
are
pleased
to
joke
with
the
unhappy
child
of
a
luckless
race
that
i
might
have
been
above
want
nay
that
i
am
not
downright
needy
may
be
true
but
when
they
speak
of
a
thousand
ducats
they
speak
of
affairs
too
weighty
for
my
burdened
shoulders
were
it
your
pleasure
to
purchase
an
amethyst
or
a
ruby
gallant
signore
there
might
possibly
be
dealings
between
us
i
have
need
of
gold
old
man
and
can
spare
thee
jewels
myself
at
need
my
wants
are
urgent
at
this
moment
and
i
have
little
time
to
lose
in
words
name
thy
conditions
one
should
have
good
securities
signore
to
be
so
peremptory
in
a
matter
of
money
thou
hast
heard
that
the
laws
of
venice
are
not
more
certain
a
thousand
sequins
and
that
quickly
thou
shalt
settle
the
usury
with
thine
own
conscience
hosea
thought
that
this
was
giving
ample
room
to
the
treaty
and
he
began
to
listen
more
seriously
signore
he
said
a
thousand
ducats
are
not
picked
up
at
pleasure
from
the
pavement
of
the
great
square
he
who
would
lend
them
must
first
earn
them
with
long
and
patient
toil
and
he
who
would
borrow
waits
at
thy
elbow
should
have
a
name
and
countenance
well
known
on
the
rialto
thou
lendest
on
sufficient
pledges
to
masks
careful
hosea
or
fame
belies
thy
generosity
a
sufficient
pledge
gives
me
power
to
see
the
way
clearly
though
the
borrower
should
be
as
much
hidden
as
those
up
above
but
here
is
none
forthcoming
come
to
me
masked
or
not
as
may
suit
your
own
pleasure
for
i
have
no
impertinent
desire
to
pry
into
any
man
secrets
beyond
what
a
regard
to
my
own
interests
requires
and
i
will
look
into
my
coffers
though
those
of
no
in
venice
can
be
emptier
my
necessities
are
too
urgent
to
brook
delay
hast
thou
the
gold
on
condition
of
naming
thine
own
usury
with
sufficient
pledges
in
stones
of
price
i
might
rake
together
the
sum
among
our
dispersed
people
signore
but
he
who
goes
on
the
island
to
borrow
as
i
shall
be
obliged
to
do
should
be
able
to
satisfy
all
doubts
concerning
the
payment
the
gold
can
then
be
had
on
that
point
i
may
be
easy
hosea
hesitated
for
he
had
in
vain
endeavored
to
penetrate
the
disguise
and
while
he
thought
his
assurance
a
favorable
omen
with
a
lender
instinct
he
disliked
his
impatience
i
have
said
by
the
friendly
aid
of
our
people
he
answered
with
caution
this
uncertainty
will
not
answer
my
need
addio
hosea
i
must
seek
elsewhere
signore
you
could
not
be
more
hurried
were
the
money
to
pay
the
cost
of
your
nuptials
could
i
find
isaac
and
aaron
within
at
this
late
hour
i
think
i
might
be
safe
in
saying
that
part
of
the
money
might
be
had
i
can
not
trust
to
this
chance
nay
signore
the
chance
is
but
small
since
aaron
is
and
isaac
never
fails
to
look
into
his
affairs
after
the
toil
of
the
day
is
ended
the
honest
hebrew
finds
sufficient
recreation
in
the
employment
though
i
marvel
at
his
satisfaction
since
nothing
but
losses
have
come
over
our
people
the
year
past
i
tell
thee
jew
no
doubt
must
hang
over
the
negotiation
the
money
with
pledges
and
thine
own
conscience
for
arbiter
between
us
but
no
equivocal
dealings
to
be
followed
by
a
disappointment
under
the
pretence
that
second
parties
are
not
satisfied
just
daniel
to
oblige
you
signore
i
think
i
may
venture
the
well
known
hebrew
levi
of
livorno
has
left
with
me
a
sack
containing
the
very
sum
of
which
there
is
question
and
under
the
conditions
named
i
will
convert
it
to
my
uses
arid
repay
the
good
jeweller
his
gold
with
moneys
of
my
own
at
a
later
day
i
thank
thee
for
the
fact
hosea
said
the
other
partially
removing
his
mask
but
as
instantly
replacing
it
it
will
greatly
shorten
our
negotiations
thou
hast
not
that
sack
of
the
jew
of
livorno
beneath
thy
domino
hosea
was
speechless
the
removal
of
the
mask
had
taught
him
two
material
facts
he
had
been
communicating
his
distrust
of
the
intentions
concerning
donna
violetta
to
an
unknown
person
and
possibly
to
an
agent
of
the
police
and
he
had
just
deprived
himself
of
the
only
argument
he
had
ever
found
available
in
refusing
the
attempts
of
giacomo
gradenigo
to
borrow
by
admitting
to
that
very
individual
that
he
had
in
his
power
the
precise
sum
required
i
trust
the
face
of
an
old
customer
is
not
likely
to
defeat
our
bargain
hosea
demanded
the
profligate
heir
of
the
senator
scarce
concealing
the
irony
in
which
the
question
was
put
father
abraham
had
i
known
it
had
been
you
signor
giacomo
we
might
have
greatly
shortened
the
treaty
by
denying
that
thou
hadst
the
money
as
thou
hast
so
often
done
of
late
nay
nay
i
am
not
a
swallower
of
my
own
words
young
signore
but
my
duty
to
levi
must
not
be
forgotten
the
careful
hebrew
made
me
take
a
vow
by
the
name
of
our
tribe
that
i
would
not
part
with
his
gold
to
any
that
had
not
the
means
of
placing
its
return
beyond
all
chances
this
assurance
is
not
wanting
since
thou
art
the
borrower
thyself
to
lend
to
me
signore
you
place
my
conscience
in
an
awkward
position
you
are
now
my
debtor
some
six
thousand
sequins
and
were
i
to
make
this
loan
of
money
in
trust
and
were
you
to
return
it
two
propositions
i
make
on
supposition
a
natural
love
for
my
own
might
cause
me
to
pass
the
payment
to
account
whereby
i
should
put
the
assets
of
levi
in
jeopardy
settle
that
as
thou
wilt
with
thy
conscience
hosea
thou
hast
confessed
to
the
money
and
here
are
jewels
for
the
pledge
i
ask
only
the
sequins
it
is
probable
that
the
appeal
of
giacomo
gradenigo
would
not
have
produced
much
effect
on
the
flinty
nature
of
the
hebrew
who
had
all
the
failings
of
a
man
proscribed
by
opinion
but
having
recovered
from
his
surprise
he
began
to
explain
to
his
companion
his
apprehensions
on
account
of
donna
violetta
whose
marriage
it
will
be
remembered
was
a
secret
to
all
but
the
witnesses
and
the
council
of
three
when
to
his
great
joy
he
found
that
the
gold
was
wanting
to
advance
his
own
design
of
removing
her
to
some
secret
place
this
immediately
changed
the
whole
face
of
the
bargain
as
the
pledges
offered
were
really
worth
the
sum
to
be
received
hosea
thought
taking
the
chances
of
recovering
back
his
ancient
loans
from
the
foreign
estates
of
the
heiress
into
the
account
the
loan
would
be
no
bad
investment
of
the
pretended
sequins
of
his
friend
levi
as
soon
as
the
parties
had
come
to
a
clear
understanding
they
left
the
square
together
to
consummate
their
bargain

the
night
wore
on
the
strains
of
music
again
began
to
break
through
the
ordinary
stillness
of
the
town
and
the
boats
of
the
great
were
once
more
in
motion
on
every
canal
hands
waved
timidly
in
recognition
from
the
windows
of
the
little
dark
canopies
as
the
gondolas
glided
by
but
few
paused
to
greet
each
other
in
that
city
of
mystery
and
suspicion
even
the
refreshing
air
of
the
evening
was
inhaled
under
an
appearance
of
restraint
which
though
it
might
not
be
at
the
moment
felt
was
too
much
interwoven
with
the
habits
of
the
people
ever
to
be
entirely
thrown
aside
among
the
lighter
and
gayer
barges
of
the
patricians
a
gondola
of
more
than
usual
size
but
of
an
exterior
so
plain
as
to
denote
vulgar
uses
came
sweeping
down
the
great
canal
its
movement
was
leisurely
and
the
action
of
the
gondoliers
that
of
men
either
fatigued
or
little
pressed
for
time
he
who
steered
guided
the
boat
with
consummate
skill
but
with
a
single
hand
while
his
three
fellows
from
time
to
time
suffered
their
oars
to
trail
on
the
water
in
very
idleness
in
short
it
had
the
ordinary
listless
appearance
of
a
boat
returning
to
the
city
from
an
excursion
on
the
brenta
or
to
some
of
the
more
distant
isles
suddenly
the
gondola
diverged
from
the
centre
of
the
passage
down
which
it
rather
floated
than
pulled
and
shot
into
one
of
the
least
frequented
canals
of
the
city
from
this
moment
its
movement
became
more
rapid
and
regular
until
it
reached
a
quarter
of
the
town
inhabited
by
the
lowest
order
of
the
venetians
here
it
stopped
by
the
side
of
a
warehouse
and
one
of
its
crew
ascended
to
a
bridge
the
others
threw
themselves
on
the
thwarts
and
seemed
to
repose
he
who
quitted
the
boat
threaded
a
few
narrow
but
public
alleys
such
as
are
to
be
found
in
every
part
of
that
confined
town
and
knocked
lightly
at
a
window
it
was
not
long
before
the
casement
opened
and
a
female
voice
demanded

thy

made
a
better
day
of
it
than
common
on
the
lido
thy
pride
always
mounts
with
thy
father
purse
diamine
to
hear
the
fellow
one
would
think
he
had
my
troth
and
that
he
only
waited
in
the
sacristy
for
the
candles
to
be
lighted
to
receive
my
vows
what
art
thou
to
me
gino
tullini
that
thou
takest
on
thee
these
sudden
airs
and
what
art
thou
to

that
thou
playest
off
these
caprices
on

out
upon

to
be
rid
of
thee
now
listen
to
what
i
say
gino
and
let
every
word
go
to
thy
heart
for
they
are
the
last
thou
wilt
ever
hear
from
me
thou
servest
a
decayed
noble
one
who
will
shortly
be
chased
in
disgrace
from
the
city
and
with
him
will
go
all
his
idle
servitors
i
choose
to
remain
in
the
city
of
my
birth
the
gondolier
laughed
in
real
indifference
at
her
affected
scorn
but
remembering
his
errand
he
quickly
assumed
a
graver
air
and
endeavored
to
still
the
resentment
of
his
fickle
mistress
by
a
more
respectful
manner
mark
protect
me
annina
he
said
if
we

it

we

not
bargain
in

of

door
with
a
gondola
of
mellow
lachryma
christi
such
as
honest
thy
father
has
rarely
dealt
in
and
thou
treatest
me
as
a
dog
that
is
chased
from
a
church
i
have
little
time
for
thee
or
thy
wines
gino
hadst
thou
not
stayed
me
i
should
already
have
been
abroad
and
happy
close
thy
door
girl
and
make
little
ceremony
with
an
old
friend
said
the
gondolier
officiously
offering
to
aid
her
in
securing
the
dwelling
annina
took
him
at
his
word
and
as
both
appeared
to
work
with
good
will
the
house
was
locked
and
the
wilful
girl
and
her
suitor
were
soon
in
the
street
their
route
lay
across
the
bridge
already
named
gino
pointed
to
the
gondola
as
he
said
thou
art
not
to
be
tempted
annina
thy
rashness
in
leading
the
smugglers
to
my
father
door
will
bring
us
to
harm
some
day
silly
fellow
the
boldness
of
the
act
will
prevent
suspicion
of
what
vineyard
is
the
liquor
it
came
from
the
foot
of
vesuvius
and
is
ripened
by
the
heat
of
the
volcano
should
my
friends
part
with
it
to
thy
enemy
old
beppo
thy
father
will
rue
the
hour
annina
who
was
much
addicted
to
consulting
her
interests
on
all
occasions
cast
a
longing
glance
at
the
boat
the
canopy
was
closed
but
it
was
large
and
her
willing
imagination
readily
induced
her
to
fancy
it
well
filled
with
skins
from
naples
this
will
be
the
last
of
thy
visits
to
our
door
gino
as
thou
shalt
please
but
go
down
and
taste
annina
hesitated
and
as
a
woman
is
said
always
to
do
when
she
hesitates
she
complied
they
reached
the
boat
with
quick
steps
and
without
regarding
the
men
who
were
still
lounging
on
the
thwarts
annina
glided
immediately
beneath
the
canopy
a
fifth
gondolier
was
lying
at
length
on
the
cushions
for
unlike
a
boat
devoted
to
the
contraband
the
canopy
had
the
usual
arrangement
of
a
barque
of
the
canals
i
see
nothing
to
turn
me
aside
exclaimed
the
disappointed
girl
wilt
thou
aught
with
me
signore
thou
art
welcome
we
shall
not
part
so
readily
as
before
the
stranger
had
arisen
while
speaking
and
as
he
ended
he
laid
a
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
his
visitor
who
found
herself
confronted
with
don
camillo
monforte
annina
was
too
much
practised
in
deception
to
indulge
in
any
of
the
ordinary
female
symptoms
either
of
real
or
of
affected
alarm
commanding
her
features
though
in
truth
her
limbs
shook
she
said
with
assumed
pleasantry
the
secret
trade
is
honored
in
the
services
of
the
noble
duke
of
st
agata
i
am
not
here
to
trifle
girl
as
thou
wilt
see
in
the
end
thou
hast
thy
choice
before
thee
frank
confession
or
my
just
anger
don
camillo
spoke
calmly
but
in
a
manner
that
plainly
showed
annina
she
had
to
deal
with
a
resolute
man
what
confession
would
your
eccellenza
have
from
the
daughter
of
a
poor
she
asked
her
voice
trembling
in
spite
of
herself
the
truth
and
remember
that
this
time
we
do
not
part
until
i
am
satisfied
the
venetian
police
and
i
are
now
fairly
at
issue
and
thou
art
the
first
fruits
of
my
plan
signor
duca
this
is
a
bold
step
to
take
in
the
heart
of
the
canals
the
consequences
be
mine
thy
interest
will
teach
thee
to
confess
i
shall
make
no
great
merit
signore
of
doing
that
which
is
forced
upon
me
as
it
is
your
pleasure
to
know
the
little
i
can
tell
you
i
am
happy
to
be
permitted
to
relate
it
speak
then
for
time
presses
signore
i
shall
not
pretend
to
deny
you
have
been
capperi
how
ill
has
the
council
treated
you
a
noble
cavalier
of
a
strange
country
who
the
meanest
gossip
in
venice
knows
has
a
just
right
to
the
honors
of
the
senate
to
be
so
treated
is
a
disgrace
to
the
republic
i
do
not
wonder
that
your
eccellenza
is
out
of
humor
with
them
blessed
mark
himself
would
lose
his
patience
to
be
thus
treated
a
truce
with
this
girl
and
to
your
facts
my
facts
signor
duca
are
a
thousand
times
clearer
than
the
sun
and
they
are
all
at
your
eccellenza
service
i
am
sure
i
wish
i
had
more
of
them
since
they
give
you
pleasure
enough
of
this
profession
speak
to
the
facts
themselves
annina
who
in
the
manner
of
most
of
her
class
in
italy
that
had
been
exposed
to
the
intrigues
of
the
towns
had
been
lavish
of
her
words
now
found
means
to
cast
a
glance
at
the
water
when
she
saw
that
the
boat
had
already
quitted
the
canals
and
was
rowing
easily
out
upon
the
lagunes
perceiving
how
completely
she
was
in
the
power
of
don
camillo
she
began
to
feel
the
necessity
of
being
more
explicit
your
eccellenza
has
probably
suspected
that
the
council
found
means
to
be
acquainted
with
your
intention
to
fly
from
the
city
with
donna
violetta
all
that
is
known
to
me
why
they
chose
me
to
be
the
servitor
of
the
noble
lady
is
beyond
my
powers
to
discover
our
lady
of
loretto
i
am
not
the
person
to
be
sent
for
when
the
state
wishes
to
part
two
lovers
i
have
borne
with
thee
annina
because
i
would
let
the
gondola
get
beyond
the
limits
of
the
city
but
now
thou
must
throw
aside
thy
subterfuge
and
speak
plainly
where
didst
thou
leave
my
wife
does
your
eccellenza
then
think
the
state
will
admit
the
marriage
to
be
legal
girl
answer
or
i
will
find
means
to
make
thee
where
didst
thou
leave
my
wife
blessed
theodore
signore
the
agents
of
the
republic
had
little
need
of
me
and
i
was
put
on
the
first
bridge
that
the
gondola
passed
thou
strivest
to
deceive
me
in
vain
thou
wast
on
the
lagunes
till
a
late
hour
in
the
day
and
i
have
notice
of
thy
having
visited
the
prison
of
mark
as
the
sun
was
setting
and
this
on
thy
return
from
the
boat
of
donna
violetta
there
was
no
acting
in
the
wonder
of
annina
santissima
maria
you
are
better
served
signore
than
the
council
thinks
as
thou
wilt
find
to
thy
cost
unless
the
truth
be
spoken
from
what
convent
thou
come
signore
from
none
if
your
eccellenza
has
discovered
that
the
senate
has
shut
up
the
signora
tiepolo
in
the
prison
of
mark
for
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
thy
artifice
is
useless
annina
observed
don
camillo
calmly
thou
wast
in
the
prison
in
quest
of
forbidden
articles
that
thou
hadst
long
left
with
thy
cousin
gelsomina
the
keeper
daughter
who
little
suspected
thy
errand
and
on
whose
innocence
and
ignorance
of
the
world
thou
hast
long
successfully
practised
donna
violetta
is
no
vulgar
prisoner
to
be
immured
in
a
jail
santissima
madre
di
dio
amazement
confined
the
answer
of
the
girl
to
this
single
but
strong
exclamation
thou
seest
the
impossibility
of
deception
i
am
acquainted
with
so
much
of
thy
movements
as
to
render
it
impossible
that
thou
lead
me
far
astray
thou
art
not
wont
to
visit
thy
cousin
but
as
thou
entered
the
canals
this
evening
a
shout
on
the
water
caused
don
camillo
to
pause
on
looking
out
he
saw
a
dense
body
of
boats
sweeping
towards
the
town
as
if
they
were
all
impelled
by
a
single
set
of
oars
a
thousand
voices
were
speaking
at
once
and
occasionally
a
general
and
doleful
cry
proclaimed
that
the
floating
multitude
which
came
on
was
moved
by
a
common
feeling
the
singularity
of
the
spectacle
and
the
fact
that
his
own
gondola
lay
directly
in
the
route
of
the
fleet
which
was
composed
of
several
hundred
boats
drove
the
examination
of
the
girl
momentarily
from
the
thoughts
of
the
noble
what
have
we
here
jacopo
he
demanded
in
an
of
the
gondolier
who
steered
his
own
barge
they
are
fishermen
signore
and
by
the
manner
in
which
they
come
down
towards
the
canals
i
doubt
they
are
bent
on
some
disturbance
there
has
been
discontent
among
them
since
the
refusal
of
the
doge
to
liberate
the
boy
of
their
companion
from
the
galleys
curiosity
induced
the
people
of
don
camillo
to
linger
a
minute
and
then
they
perceived
the
necessity
of
pulling
out
of
the
course
of
the
floating
mass
which
came
on
like
a
torrent
the
men
sweeping
their
boats
with
that
desperate
stroke
which
is
so
often
seen
among
the
italian
oarsmen
a
menacing
hail
with
a
command
to
remain
admonished
don
camillo
of
the
necessity
of
downright
flight
or
of
obedience
he
chose
the
latter
as
the
least
likely
to
interfere
with
his
own
plans
who
art
thou
demanded
one
who
had
assumed
the
character
of
a
leader
if
men
of
the
lagunes
and
christians
join
your
friends
and
away
with
us
to
mark
for
justice
what
means
this
tumult
asked
don
camillo
whose
dress
effectually
concealed
his
rank
a
disguise
that
he
completed
by
adopting
the
venetian
dialect
why
are
you
here
in
these
numbers
friends
behold
don
camillo
turned
and
he
beheld
the
withered
features
and
glaring
eyes
of
old
antonio
fixed
in
death
the
explanation
was
made
by
a
hundred
voices
accompanied
by
oaths
so
bitter
and
denunciations
so
deep
that
had
not
don
camillo
been
prepared
by
the
tale
of
jacopo
he
would
have
found
great
difficulty
in
understanding
what
he
heard
in
dragging
the
lagunes
for
fish
the
body
of
antonio
had
been
found
and
the
result
was
first
a
consultation
on
the
probable
means
of
his
death
and
then
a
collection
of
the
men
of
his
calling
and
finally
the
scene
described
giustizia
exclaimed
fifty
excited
voices
as
the
grim
visage
of
the
fisherman
was
held
towards
the
light
of
the
moon

to
cast
our

in
the

lest
the
secrets
of

should
be
known
and
yet
they
have
grown
bold
enough
to
drown

the
fishermen
again
plied
their
oars
and
the
whole
fleet
swept
away
as
if
it
was
composed
of
a
single
mass
the
meeting
though
so
short
was
accompanied
by
cries
menaces
and
all
those
accustomed
signs
of
rage
which
mark
a
popular
tumult
among
those
excitable
people
and
it
had
produced
a
sensible
effect
on
the
nerves
of
annina
don
camillo
profited
by
her
evident
terror
to
press
his
questions
for
the
hour
no
longer
admitted
of
trifling
the
result
was
that
while
the
agitated
mob
swept
into
the
mouth
of
the
great
canal
raising
hoarse
shouts
the
gondola
of

the
tranquillity
of
the
best
ordered
society
may
be
disturbed
at
any
time
by
a
sudden
outbreaking
of
the
malcontents
against
such
a
disaster
there
is
no
more
guarding
than
against
the
commission
of
more
vulgar
crimes
but
when
a
government
trembles
for
its
existence
before
the
turbulence
of
popular
commotion
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
some
radical
defect
in
its
organization
men
will
rally
around
their
institutions
as
freely
as
they
rally
around
any
other
cherished
interest
when
they
merit
their
care
and
there
can
be
no
surer
sign
of
their
hollowness
than
when
the
rulers
seriously
apprehend
the
breath
of
the
mob
no
nation
ever
exhibited
more
of
this
symptomatic
terror
on
all
occasions
of
internal
disturbance
than
the
pretending
republic
of
venice
there
was
a
and
a
natural
tendency
to
dissolution
in
her
factious
system
which
was
only
resisted
by
the
alertness
of
her
aristocracy
and
the
political
buttresses
which
their
ingenuity
had
reared
much
was
said
of
the
venerable
character
of
her
polity
and
of
its
consequent
security
but
it
is
in
vain
that
selfishness
contends
with
truth
of
all
the
fallacies
with
which
man
has
attempted
to
gloss
his
expedients
there
is
none
more
evidently
false
than
that
which
infers
the
duration
of
a
social
system
from
the
length
of
time
it
has
already
lasted
it
would
be
quite
as
reasonable
to
affirm
that
the
man
of
seventy
has
the
same
chances
for
life
as
the
youth
of
fifteen
or
that
the
inevitable
fate
of
all
things
of
mortal
origin
was
not
destruction
there
is
a
period
in
human
existence
when
the
principle
of
vitality
has
to
contend
with
the
feebleness
of
infancy
but
this
probationary
state
passed
the
child
attains
the
age
when
it
has
the
most
reasonable
prospect
of
living
thus
the
social
like
any
other
machine
which
has
run
just
long
enough
to
prove
its
fitness
is
at
the
precise
period
when
it
is
least
likely
to
fail
and
although
he
that
is
young
may
not
live
to
become
old
it
is
certain
that
he
who
is
old
was
once
young
the
empire
of
china
was
in
its
time
as
youthful
as
our
own
republic
nor
can
we
see
any
reason
for
believing
that
it
is
to
outlast
us
from
the
decrepitude
which
is
a
natural
companion
of
its
years
at
the
period
of
our
tale
venice
boasted
much
of
her
antiquity
and
dreaded
in
an
equal
degree
her
end
she
was
still
strong
in
her
combinations
but
they
were
combinations
that
had
the
vicious
error
of
being
formed
for
the
benefit
of
the
minority
and
which
like
the
mimic
fortresses
and
moats
of
a
scenic
representation
needed
only
a
strong
light
to
destroy
the
illusion
the
alarm
with
which
the
patricians
heard
the
shouts
of
the
fishermen
as
they
swept
by
the
different
palaces
on
their
way
to
the
great
square
can
be
readily
imagined
some
feared
that
the
final
consummation
of
their
artificial
condition
which
had
so
long
been
anticipated
by
a
secret
political
instinct
was
at
length
arrived
and
began
to
bethink
them
of
the
savest
means
of
providing
for
their
own
security
some
listened
in
admiration
for
habit
had
so
far
mastered
dulness
as
to
have
created
a
species
of
identity
between
the
state
and
far
more
durable
things
and
they
believed
that
mark
had
gained
a
victory
in
that
decline
which
was
never
exactly
intelligible
to
their
apathetic
capacities
but
a
few
and
these
were
the
spirits
that
accumulated
all
the
national
good
which
was
vulgarly
and
falsely
ascribed
to
the
system
itself
intuitively
comprehended
the
danger
with
a
just
appreciation
of
its
magnitude
as
well
as
of
the
means
to
avoid
it
but
the
rioters
were
unequal
to
any
estimate
of
their
own
force
and
had
little
aptitude
in
measuring
their
accidental
advantages
they
acted
merely
on
impulse
the
manner
in
which
their
aged
companion
had
triumphed
on
the
preceding
day
his
cold
repulse
by
the
doge
and
the
scene
of
the
lido
which
in
truth
led
to
the
death
of
antonio
had
prepared
their
minds
for
the
tumult
when
the
body
was
found
therefore
after
the
time
necessary
to
collect
their
forces
on
the
lagunes
they
yielded
to
passion
and
moved
away
towards
the
palace
of
mark
as
described
without
any
other
definite
object
than
a
simple
indulgence
of
feeling
on
entering
the
canal
the
narrowness
of
the
passage
compressed
the
boats
into
a
mass
so
dense
as
in
a
measure
to
impede
the
use
of
oars
and
the
progress
of
the
crowd
was
necessarily
slow
all
were
anxious
to
get
as
near
as
possible
to
the
body
of
antonio
and
like
all
mobs
they
in
some
degree
frustrated
their
own
objects
by
zeal
once
or
twice
the
names
of
offensive
senators
were
shouted
as
if
the
fishermen
intended
to
visit
the
crimes
of
the
state
on
its
agents
but
these
cries
passed
away
in
the
violent
breath
that
was
expended
on
reaching
the
bridge
of
the
rialto
more
than
half
of
the
multitude
landed
and
took
the
shorter
course
of
the
streets
to
the
point
of
destination
while
those
in
front
got
on
the
faster
for
being
disembarrassed
of
the
pressure
in
the
rear
as
they
drew
nearer
to
the
port
the
boats
began
to
loosen
and
to
take
something
of
the
form
of
a
funeral
procession
it
was
during
this
moment
of
change
that
a
powerfully
manned
gondola
swept
with
strong
strokes
out
of
a
lateral
passage
into
the
great
canal
accident
brought
it
directly
in
front
of
the
moving
phalanx
of
boats
that
was
coming
down
the
same
channel
its
crew
seemed
staggered
by
the
extraordinary
appearance
which
met
their
view
and
for
an
instant
its
course
was
undecided
a
gondola
of
the
republic
shouted
fifty
fishermen
a
single
voice
added
canale
orfano
the
bare
suspicion
of
such
an
errand
as
was
implied
by
the
latter
words
and
at
that
moment
was
sufficient
to
excite
the
mob
they
raised
a
cry
of
denunciation
and
some
twenty
boats
made
a
furious
demonstration
of
pursuit
the
menace
however
was
sufficient
for
quicker
far
than
the
movements
of
the
pursuers
the
gondoliers
of
the
republic
dashed
towards
the
shore
and
leaping
on
one
of
those
passages
of
planks
which
encircle
so
many
of
the
palaces
of
venice
they
disappeared
by
an
alley
encouraged
by
this
success
the
fishermen
seized
the
boat
as
a
waif
and
towed
it
into
their
own
fleet
filling
the
air
with
cries
of
triumph
curiosity
led
a
few
to
enter
the
canopy
whence
they
immediately
reissued
dragging
forth
a
priest
who
art
thou
hoarsely
demanded
he
who
took
upon
himself
the
authority
of
a
leader
a
carmelite
and
a
servant
of
god
dost
thou
serve
mark
hast
thou
been
to
the
canale
orfano
to
shrive
a
wretch
i
am
here
in
attendance
on
a
young
and
noble
lady
who
has
need
of
my
counsel
and
prayers
the
happy
and
the
miserable
the
free
and
the
captive
are
equally
my
care
ha
thou
art
not
above
thy
office
thou
wilt
say
the
prayers
for
the
dead
in
behalf
of
a
poor
man
soul
my
son
i
know
no
difference
in
this
respect
between
the
doge
and
the
poorest
fisherman
still
i
would
not
willingly
desert
the
females
the
ladies
shall
receive
no
harm
come
into
my
boat
for
there
is
need
of
thy
holy
office
father
anselmo
the
reader
will
readily
anticipate
that
it
was
he
entered
the
canopy
said
a
few
words
in
explanation
to
his
trembling
companions
and
complied
he
was
rowed
to
the
leading
gondola
and
by
a
sign
directed
to
the
dead
body
thou
that
corpse
father
continued
his
conductor
it
is
the
face
of
one
who
was
an
upright
and
pious
christian
he
was
we
all
knew
him
as
the
oldest
and
the
most
skilful
fisherman
of
the
lagunes
and
one
ever
ready
to
assist
an
unlucky
companion
i
can
believe
thee
thou
mayest
for
the
holy
books
are
not
more
true
than
my
words
yesterday
he
came
down
this
very
canal
in
triumph
for
he
bore
away
the
honors
of
the
regatta
from
the
stoutest
oars
in
venice
i
have
heard
of
his
success
they
say
that
jacopo
the
bravo
he
who
once
held
the
best
oar
in
the
canals
was
of
the
party
santa

such
a
man
was
too
precious
to
die
it
is
the
fate
of
all
rich
and
poor
strong
and
feeble
happy
and
miserable
must
alike
come
to
this
end
not
to
this
end

thou

make
good
thy
words
i
will
said
father
anselmo
firmly
make
room
son
that
no
decency
of
my
duty
be
overlooked
the
swarthy
expressive
faces
of
the
fishermen
gleamed
with
satisfaction
for
in
the
midst
of
the
rude
turmoil
they
all
retained
a
deep
and
rooted
respect
for
the
offices
of
the
church
in
which
they
had
been
educated
silence
was
quickly
obtained
and
the
boats
moved
on
with
greater
order
than
before
the
spectacle
was
now
striking
in
front
rowed
the
gondola
which
contained
the
remains
of
the
dead
the
widening
of
the
canal
as
it
approached
the
port
permitted
the
rays
of
the
moon
to
fall
upon
the
rigid
features
of
old
antonio
which
were
set
in
such
a
look
as
might
be
supposed
to
characterize
the
dying
thoughts
of
a
man
so
suddenly
and
so
fearfully
destroyed
the
carmelite
with
clasped
hands
and
a
devout
heart
bowed
his
head
at
the
feet
of
the
body
with
his
white
robes
flowing
in
the
light
of
the
moon
a
single
gondolier
guided
the
boat
and
no
other
noise
was
audible
but
the
plash
of
the
water
as
the
oars
slowly
fell
and
rose
together
this
silent
procession
lasted
a
few
minutes
and
then
the
tremulous
voice
of
the
monk
was
heard
chanting
the
prayers
for
the
dead
the
practised
fishermen
for
few
in
that
disciplined
church
and
that
obedient
age
were
ignorant
of
those
solemn
rites
took
up
the
responses
in
a
manner
that
must
be
familiar
to
every
ear
that
has
ever
listened
to
the
sounds
of
italy
the
gentle
washing
of
the
element
on
which
they
glided
forming
a
soft
accompaniment
casement
after
casement
opened
while
they
passed
and
a
thousand
curious
and
anxious
faces
crowded
the
balconies
as
the
funeral
cortége
swept
slowly
on
the
gondola
of
the
republic
was
towed
in
the
centre
of
the
moving
mass
by
fifty
lighter
boats
for
the
fishermen
still
clung
to
their
prize
in
this
manner
the
solemn
procession
entered
the
port
and
touched
the
quay
at
the
foot
of
the
piazzetta
while
numberless
eager
hands
were
aiding
in
bringing
the
body
of
antonio
to
land
there
arose
a
shout
from
the
centre
of
the
ducal
palace
which
proclaimed
the
presence
already
of
the
other
part
of
their
body
in
its
court
the
squares
of
mark
now
presented
a
novel
picture
the
quaint
and
oriental
church
the
rows
of
massive
and
rich
architecture
the
giddy
pile
of
the
campanile
the
columns
of
granite
the
masts
of
triumph
and
all
those
peculiar
and
remarkable
fixtures
which
had
witnessed
so
many
scenes
of
violence
of
rejoicing
of
mourning
and
of
gaiety
were
there
like
landmarks
of
the
earth
defying
time
beautiful
and
venerable
in
despite
of
all
those
varying
exhibitions
of
human
passions
that
were
daily
acted
around
them
but
the
song
the
laugh
and
the
jest
had
ceased
the
lights
of
the
had
disappeared
the
revellers
had
fled
to
their
homes
fearful
of
being
confounded
with
those
who
braved
the
anger
of
the
senate
while
the
grotesque
the
and
the
buffoon
had
abandoned
their
assumed
gaiety
for
an
appearance
more
in
unison
with
the
true
feelings
of
their
hearts
giustizia
cried
a
thousand
deep
voices
as
the
body
of
antonio
was
borne
into
the
court
illustrious
doge
giustizia
in
palazzo
e
pane
in
piazza
give
us
justice
we
are
beggars
for
justice
the
gloomy
but
vast
court
was
paved
with
the
swarthy
faces
and
glittering
eyes
of
the
fishermen
the
corpse
was
laid
at
the
foot
of
the
giant
stairs
while
the
trembling
halberdier
at
the
head
of
the
flight
scarce
commanded
himself
sufficiently
to
maintain
that
air
of
firmness
which
was
exacted
by
discipline
and
professional
pride
but
there
was
no
other
show
of
military
force
for
the
politic
power
which
ruled
in
venice
knew
too
well
its
momentary
impotency
to
irritate
when
it
could
not
quell
the
mob
beneath
was
composed
of
nameless
rioters
whose
punishment
could
carry
no
other
consequences
than
the
suppression
of
immediate
danger
and
for
that
those
who
ruled
were
not
prepared
the
council
of
three
had
been
apprised
of
the
arrival
of
the
excited
fishermen
when
the
mob
entered
the
court
it
was
consulting
in
secret
conclave
on
the
probabilities
of
the
tumult
having
a
graver
and
more
determined
object
than
was
apparent
in
the
visible
symptoms
the
routine
of
office
had
not
yet
dispossessed
the
men
already
presented
to
the
reader
of
their
dangerous
and
despotic
power
are
the
dalmatians
apprised
of
this
movement
asked
one
of
the
secret
tribunal
whose
nerves
were
scarcely
equal
to
the
high
functions
he
discharged
we
may
have
occasion
for
their
volleys
ere
this
riot
is
appeased
confide
in
the
ordinary
authorities
for
that
signore
answered
the
senator
gradenigo
i
have
only
concern
lest
some
conspiracy
which
may
touch
the
fidelity
of
the
troops
lies
concealed
beneath
the
outcry
the
evil
passions
of
man
know
no
limits
what
would
the
wretches
have
for
a
state
in
the
decline
venice
is
to
the
last
degree
prosperous
our
ships
are
thriving
the
bank
flourishes
with
goodly
dividends
and
i
do
assure
you
signore
that
for
many
years
i
have
not
known
so
ample
revenues
for
most
of
our
interests
as
at
this
hour
all
can
not
thrive
alike
you
are
happily
connected
with
flourishing
affairs
signore
but
there
are
many
that
are
less
lucky
our
form
of
government
is
somewhat
exclusive
and
it
is
a
penalty
that
we
have
ever
paid
for
its
advantages
to
be
liable
to
sudden
and
malevolent
accusations
for
any
evil
turn
of
fortune
that
besets
the
republic
can
nothing
satisfy
these
exacting
spirits
are
they
not
free
are
they
not
happy
it
would
seem
that
they
want
better
assurance
of
these
facts
than
our
own
feelings
or
our
words
man
is
the
creature
of
envy
the
poor
desire
to
be
rich
the
weak
powerful
there
is
an
exception
to
your
rule
at
least
signore
since
the
rich
rarely
wish
to
be
poor
or
the
powerful
weak
you
deride
my
sentiments
signor
gradenigo
i
speak
i
hope
as
becomes
a
senator
of
venice
and
in
a
manner
that
you
are
not
unaccustomed
to
hear
nay
the
language
is
not
unusual
but
i
fear
me
there
is
something
unsuited
to
a
falling
fortune
in
the
exacting
and
narrow
spirit
of
our
laws
when
a
state
is
eminently
flourishing
its
subjects
overlook
general
defects
in
private
prosperity
but
there
is
no
more
fastidious
commentator
on
measures
than
your
merchant
of
a
failing
trade
this
is
their
gratitude
have
we
not
converted
these
muddy
isles
into
a
mart
for
half
christendom
and
now
they
are
dissatisfied
that
they
can
not
retain
all
the
monopolies
that
the
wisdom
of
our
ancestors
has
accumulated
they
complain
much
in
your
own
spirit
signore
but
you
are
right
in
saying
the
present
riot
must
be
looked
to
let
us
seek
his
highness
who
will
go
out
to
the
people
with
such
patricians
as
may
be
present
and
one
of
our
number
as
a
witness
more
than
that
might
expose
our
character
the
secret
council
withdrew
to
carry
this
resolution
into
effect
just
as
the
fishermen
in
the
court
received
the
accession
of
those
who
arrived
by
water
there
is
no
body
so
sensible
of
an
increase
of
its
members
as
a
mob
without
discipline
and
dependent
solely
on
animal
force
for
its
ascendency
the
sentiment
of
physical
power
is
blended
with
its
very
existence
when
they
saw
the
mass
of
living
beings
which
had
assembled
within
the
wall
of
the
ducal
palace
the
most
audacious
of
that
throng
became
more
hardy
and
even
the
wavering
grew
strong
this
is
the
reverse
of
the
feeling
which
prevails
among
those
who
are
called
on
to
repress
this
species
of
violence
who
generally
gain
courage
as
its
exhibition
is
least
required
the
throng
in
the
court
was
raising
one
of
its
loudest
and
most
menacing
cries
as
the
train
of
the
doge
appeared
approaching
by
one
of
the
long
open
galleries
of
the
principal
floor
of
the
edifice
the
presence
of
the
venerable
man
who
nominally
presided
over
that
factitious
state
and
the
long
training
of
the
fishermen
in
habits
of
deference
to
authority
notwithstanding
their
present
tone
of
insubordination
caused
a
sudden
and
deep
silence
a
feeling
of
awe
gradually
stole
over
the
thousand
dark
faces
that
were
gazing
upwards
as
the
little
cortége
drew
near
so
profound
indeed
was
the
stillness
caused
by
this
sentiment
that
the
rustling
of
the
ducal
robes
was
audible
as
the
prince
impeded
by
his
infirmities
and
consulting
the
state
usual
to
his
rank
slowly
advanced
the
previous
violence
of
the
untutored
fishermen
and
their
present
deference
to
the
external
state
that
met
their
eyes
had
its
origin
in
the
same
causes
ignorance
and
habit
were
the
parents
of
both
why
are
ye
assembled
here
my
children
asked
the
doge
when
he
had
reached
the
summit
of
the
giant
stairs
and
most
of
all
why
have
ye
come
into
the
palace
of
your
prince
with
these
unbefitting
cries
the
tremulous
voice
of
the
old
man
was
clearly
audible
for
the
lowest
of
its
tones
were
scarcely
interrupted
by
a
breath
the
fishermen
gazed
at
each
other
and
all
appeared
to
search
for
him
who
might
be
bold
enough
to
answer
at
length
one
in
the
centre
of
the
crowded
mass
and
effectually
concealed
from
observation
cried
justice
such
is
our
object
mildly
continued
the
prince
and
such
i
will
add
is
our
practice
why
are
ye
assembled
here
in
a
manner
so
offensive
to
the
state
and
so
disrespectful
to
your
prince
still
none
answered
the
only
spirit
of
their
body
which
had
been
capable
of
freeing
itself
from
the
trammels
of
usage
and
prejudice
had
deserted
the
shell
which
lay
on
the
lower
step
of
the
giant
stairs
will
none
speak
are
ye
so
bold
with
your
voices
when
unquestioned
and
so
silent
when
confronted
speak
them
fair
your
highness
whispered
he
of
the
council
who
was
commissioned
to
be
a
secret
witness
of
the
interview
the
dalmatians
are
scarce
yet
apparelled
the
prince
bowed
to
advice
which
he
well
knew
must
be
respected
and
he
assumed
his
former
tone
if
none
will
acquaint
me
with
your
wants
i
must
command
you
to
retire
and
while
my
parental
heart
grieves
giustizia
repeated
the

was
always

in

and
the
discreetest
in
knowing
when
to
be

the
doge
began
to
have
a
dawning
of
the
truth
and
he
cast
a
glance
aside
to
examine
the
countenance
of
the
unknown
inquisitor
it
is
far
easier
to
understand
the
merits
of
the
unfortunate
man
than
the
manner
of
his

he
said

speaker
among

willingly
took
on
himself
the
office
and
in
the
desultory
manner
of
one
of

he
acquainted
the
doge
with
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
finding
of
the
body
when
he
had
done
the

again
asked
explanations
with
his
eye
from
the
senator
at
his
side
for
he
was
ignorant
whether
the
policy
of
the

required
an
example
or
simply
a
death
i
see
nothing
in
this
your

observed

but
the
chances
of
a

the
unhappy
old
man
has
come
to
his
end
by
accident
and
it
would
be
charity
to
have
a
few
masses
said
for
his
soul
noble
senator
exclaimed
the
fisherman
doubtingly
mark
was
offended
rumor
tells
many
idle
tales
of
the
pleasure
and
displeasure
of
mark
if
we
are
to
believe
all
that
the
wit
of
men
can
devise
in
affairs
of
this
nature
the
criminals
are
not
drowned
in
the
lagunes
but
in
the
canale

true
eccellenza
and
we
are
forbidden
to
cast
our
nets
there
on
pain
of
sleeping
with
the
eels
at
its
bottom
so
much
greater
reason
for
believing
that
this
old
man
hath
died
by
accident
is
there
mark
of
violence
on
his
body
for
though
the

could
scarcely
occupy
itself
with
such
as
he
some
other
might
hath
the
condition
of

been
looked
to

it
was
enough
to
cast
one
of
his
years
into
the
centre
of
the

the
stoutest
arm
in

could
not
save
him
there
may
have
been
violence
in

quarrel

the
proper
authority

be
vigilant
here

do
you
know
aught
of
this
the
monk
endeavored
to
answer
but
his
voice
failed
he
stared
wildly
about
him
for
the
whole
scene
resembled
some
frightful
picture
of
the
imagination
and
then
folding
his
arms
on
his
bosom
he
appeared
to
resume
his
prayers

dost
not

observed
the
doge
who
had
been
as
effectually
deceived
by
the
natural
and
indifferent
manner
of
the
inquisitor
as
any
other
of
his
auditors
where
didst
thou
find
this

briefly
explained
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
pressed
into
the
service
of
the
fishermen
at
the
elbow
of
the
prince
there
stood
a
young
patrician
who
at
the
moment
filled
no
other
office
in
the
state
than
such
as
belonged
to
his
birth
deceived
like
the
others
by
the
manner
of
the
only
one
who
knew
the
real
cause
of
antonio
death
he
felt
a
humane
and
praiseworthy
desire
to
make
sure
that
no
foul
play
had
been
exercised
towards
the
victim
i
have
heard
of
this
antonio
said
this
person
who
was
called
the
senator
soranzo
and
who
was
gifted
by
nature
with
feelings
that
in
any
other
form
of
government
would
have
made
him
a
philanthropist
and
of
his
success
in
the
regatta
was
it
not
said
that
jacopo
the
bravo
was
his
competitor
a
low
meaning
and
common
murmur
ran
through
the
throng
a
man
of
his
reputed
passions
and
ferocity
may
well
have
sought
to
revenge
defeat
by
violence

a
louder
murmur

the

still
doubting

that

character
may
have
recourse
to
other
means
to
gratify
his
malice
do
you
not
agree
with
me
signore
the
senator
soranzo
put
this
question
in
perfect
good
faith
to
the
unknown
member
of
the
secret
council
the
latter
appeared
struck
with
the
probability
of
the
truth
of
his
companion
conjecture
but
contented
himself
with
a
simple
acknowledgment
to
that
effect
by
bowing

said
the

and
thou
canst
do
no
better
service
than
to
pass
the
night
in
prayer
by
its
side
a
thousand
caps
were
waved
in
commendation
of
this
gracious
command
and
the
whole
throng
stood
in
silent
respect
as
the
prince
followed
by
his
retinue
retired
as
he
had
approached
through
the
long
vaulted
gallery
above
a
secret
order
of
the
inquisition
prevented
the
appearance
of
the
dalmatians
a
few
minutes
later
and
all
was
prepared
a
bier
and
canopy
were
brought
out
of
the
adjoining
cathedral
and
the
corpse
was
placed
upon
the
former
father
anselmo
then
headed
the
procession
which
passed
through
the
principal
gate
of
the
palace
into
the
square
chanting
the
usual
service
the
piazzetta
and
the
piazza
were
still
empty
here
and
there
indeed
a
curious
face
belonging
to
some
agent
of
the
police
or
to
some
observer
more
firm
than
common
looked
out
from
beneath
the
arches
of
the
porticoes
on
the
movements
of
the
mob
though
none
ventured
to
come
within
its
influence
but
the
fishermen
were
no
longer
bent
on
violence
with
the
fickleness
of
men
little
influenced
by
reflection
and
subject
to
sudden
and
violent
emotions
a
temperament
which
the
effect
of
a
selfish
system
is
commonly
tortured
into
the
reason
why
it
should
never
be
improved
they
had
abandoned
all
idea
of
revenge
on
the
agents
of
the
police
and
had
turned
their
thoughts
to
the
religious
services
which
being
commanded
by
the
prince
himself
were
so
flattering
to
their
class
it
is
true
that
a
few
of
the
sterner
natures
among
them
mingled
menaces
against
the
bravo
with
their
prayers
for
the
dead
but
these
had
no
other
effect
on
the
matter
in
hand
than
is
commonly
produced
by
the
on
the
principal
action
of
the
piece
the
great
portal
of
the
venerable
church
was
thrown
open
and
the
solemn
chant
was
heard
issuing
in
responses
from
among
the
quaint
columns
and
vaulted
roofs
within
the
body
of
the
lowly
and
sacrificed
antonio
was
borne
beneath
that
arch
which
sustains
the
precious
relics
of
grecian
art
and
deposited
in
the
nave
candles
glimmered
before
the
altar
and
around
the
ghastly
person
of
the
dead
throughout
the
night
and
the
cathedral
of
mark
was
pregnant
with
all
the
imposing
ceremonials
of
the
catholic
ritual
until
the
day
once
more
appeared
priest
succeeded
priest
in
repeating
the
masses
while
the
attentive
throng
listened
as
if
each
of
its
members
felt
that
his
own
honor
and
importance
were
elevated
by
this
concession
to
one
of
their
number
in
the
square
the
maskers
gradually
reappeared
though
the
alarm
had
been
too
sudden
and
violent
to
admit
a
speedy
return
to
the
levity
which
ordinarily
was
witnessed
in
that
spot
between
the
setting
and
the
rising
of

of
a
lady
in
her
earliest
youth
the
very
last
of
that
illustrious
race
rogers
when
the
fishermen
landed
on
the
quay
they
deserted
the
gondola
of
the
state
to
a
man
donna
violetta
and
her
governess
heard
the
tumultuous
departure
of
their
singular
captors
with
alarm
for
they
were
nearly
in
entire
ignorance
of
the
motive
which
had
deprived
them
of
the
protection
of
father
anselmo
and
which
had
so
unexpectedly
made
them
actors
in
the
extraordinary
scene
the
monk
had
simply
explained
that
his
offices
were
required
in
behalf
of
the
dead
but
the
apprehension
of
exciting
unnecessary
terror
prevented
him
from
adding
that
they
were
in
the
power
of
a
mob
donna
florinda
however
had
ascertained
sufficient
by
looking
from
the
windows
of
the
canopy
and
from
the
cries
of
those
around
her
to
get
a
glimmering
of
the
truth
under
the
circumstances
she
saw
that
the
most
prudent
course
was
to
keep
themselves
as
much
as
possible
from
observation
but
when
the
profound
stillness
that
succeeded
the
landing
of
the
rioters
announced
that
they
were
alone
both
she
and
her
charge
had
an
intuitive
perception
of
the
favorable
chance
which
fortune
had
so
strangely
thrown
in
their
way
they
are
gone
whispered
donna
florinda
holding
her
breath
in
attention
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken
and
the
police
will
be
soon
here
to
seek
us
no
further
explanation
passed
for
venice
was
a
town
in
which
even
the
young
and
innocent
were
taught
caution
donna
florinda
stole
another
look
without
they
have
disappeared
heaven
knows
where
let
us
go
in
an
instant
the
trembling
fugitives
were
on
the
quay
the
piazzetta
was
without
a
human
form
except
their
own
a
low
murmuring
sound
arose
from
the
court
palace
which
resembled
the
hum
of
a
disturbed
hive
but
nothing
was
distinct
or
intelligible
there
is
violence
meditated
again
whispered
the
governess
would
to
god
that
father
anselmo
were
here
a
shuffling
footstep
caught
their
ears
and
both
turned
towards
a
boy
in
the
dress
of
one
of
the
lagunes
who
approached
from
the
direction
of
the
broglio
a
reverend
carmelite
bid
me
give
you
this
said
the
youth
stealing
a
glance
behind
him
like
one
who
dreaded
detection
then
putting
a
small
piece
of
paper
in
the
hand
of
donna
florinda
he
turned
his
own
swarthy
palm
in
which
a
small
silver
coin
glittered
to
the
moon
and
vanished
by
the
aid
of
the
same
light
the
governess
succeeded
in
tracing
in
a
hand
that
had
been
well
known
to
her
younger
days
save
thyself
florinda
there
is
not
an
instant
to
lose
avoid
public
places
and
seek
a
shelter
quickly
but
whither
asked
the
bewildered
woman
when
she
had
read
aloud
the
scroll
anywhere
but
here
rejoined
donna
violetta
follow
me
nature
frequently
more
than
supplies
the
advantages
of
training
and
experience
by
her
own
gifts
had
donna
florinda
been
possessed
of
the
natural
decision
and
firmness
of
her
pupil
she
would
not
now
have
been
existing
in
the
isolated
condition
which
is
so
little
congenial
to
female
habits
nor
would
father
anselmo
have
been
a
monk
both
had
sacrificed
inclination
to
what
they
considered
to
be
duty
and
if
the
ungenial
life
of
the
governess
was
owing
to
the
tranquil
course
of
her
ordinary
feelings
it
is
probable
that
its
impunity
was
to
be
ascribed
to
the
same
respectable
cause
not
so
with
violetta
she
was
ever
more
ready
to
act
than
to
reflect
and
though
in
general
the
advantage
might
possibly
be
with
those
of
a
more
regulated
temperament
there
are
occasions
that
form
exceptions
to
the
rule
the
present
moment
was
one
of
those
turns
in
the
chances
of
life
when
it
is
always
better
to
do
anything
than
to
do
nothing
donna
violetta
had
scarcely
spoken
before
her
person
was
shadowed
beneath
the
arches
of
the
broglio
her
governess
clung
to
her
side
more
in
affection
than
in
compliance
with
the
warnings
of
the
monk
or
with
the
dictates
of
her
own
reason
a
vague
and
romantic
intention
of
throwing
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
doge
who
was
a
collateral
descendant
of
her
own
ancient
house
had
flashed
across
the
mind
of
the
youthful
bride
when
she
first
fled
but
no
sooner
had
they
reached
the
palace
than
a
cry
from
the
court
acquainted
them
with
its
situation
and
consequently
with
the
impossibility
of
penetrating
to
the
interior
let
us
retire
by
the
streets
to
thy
dwelling
my
child
said
donna
florinda
drawing
her
mantle
about
her
in
womanly
dignity
none
will
offend
females
of
our
condition
even
the
senate
must
in
the
end
respect
our
sex
this
from
thee
florinda
thou
who
hast
so
often
trembled
for
their
anger
but
go
if
thou
wilt
i
am
no
longer
the
senate
don
camillo
monforte
has
my
duty
donna
florinda
had
no
intention
of
disputing
this
point
and
as
the
moment
had
now
arrived
when
the
most
energetic
was
likely
to
lead
she
quietly
submitted
herself
to
the
superior
decision
of
her
pupil
the
latter
took
the
way
along
the
portico
keeping
always
within
its
shadows
in
passing
the
gateway
which
opened
towards
the
sea
the
fugitives
had
a
glimpse
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
court
the
sight
quickened
their
steps
and
they
now
flew
rather
than
ran
along
the
arched
passage
in
a
minute
they
were
on
the
bridge
which
crosses
the
canal
of
mark
still
flying
with
all
their
force
a
few
mariners
were
looking
from
their
feluccas
and
gazing
in
curiosity
but
the
sight
of
two
terrified
females
seeking
refuge
from
a
mob
had
nothing
in
itself
likely
to
attract
notice
at
this
moment
a
dark
mass
of
human
bodies
appeared
advancing
along
the
quay
in
the
opposite
direction
arms
glittered
in
the
and
the
measured
tread
of
trained
men
became
audible
the
dalmatians
were
moving
down
from
the
arsenal
in
a
body
advance
and
retreat
now
seemed
equally
impossible
to
the
breathless
fugitives
as
decision
and
are
very
different
qualities
donna
violetta
did
not
understand
so
readily
as
the
circumstances
required
that
it
was
more
than
probable
the
hirelings
of
the
republic
would
consider
the
flight
perfectly
natural
as
it
had
appeared
to
the
curious
gazers
of
the
port
terror
made
them
blind
and
as
shelter
was
now
the
sole
object
of
the
fugitives
they
would
probably
have
sought
it
in
the
chamber
of
doom
itself
had
there
been
an
opportunity
as
it
was
they
turned
and
entered
the
first
and
indeed
the
only
gate
which
offered
they
were
met
by
a
girl
whose
anxious
face
betrayed
that
singular
compound
of
and
terror
which
probably
has
its
rise
in
the
instinct
of
feminine
sympathies
here
is
safety
noble
ladies
said
the
youthful
venetian
in
the
soft
accent
of
her
native
islands
none
will
dare
do
you
harm
within
these
walls
into
whose
palace
have
i

the

a
name
in

and
still
leading
the
way
deeper
within
the
vast
edifice
you
bear
the
name
of
an
illustrious
house
there
are
few
in
the
republic
of
note
from
whom
i
may
not
claim
either
the
kindness
of
ancient
and
near
services
or
that
of
kindred
dost
thou
serve
a
noble
master
the
first
in
venice
lady
name
him
that
we
may
demand
his
hospitality
as
befits
us
saint
mark
donna
violetta
and
her
governess
stopped
short
have
we
unconsciously
entered
a
portal
of
the
palace
that
were
impossible
lady
since
the
canal
lies
between
you
and
the
residence
of
the
doge
still
is
mark
master
here
i
hope
you
will
not
esteem
your
safety
less
because
it
has
been
obtained
in
the
public
prison
and
by
the
aid
of
its
keeper
daughter
the
moment
for
headlong
decision
was
passed
and
that
of
reflection
had
returned
how
art
thou
called
child
asked
donna
florinda
moving
ahead
of
her
pupil
and
taking
the
discourse
up
where
in
wonder
the
other
had
permitted
it
to
pause
we
are
truly
grateful
for
the
readiness
with
which
thou
threw
open
the
gate
for
our
admission
in
a
moment
of
such
alarm
how
art
thou
called
gelsomina
answered
the
modest
girl
i
am
the
keeper
only
child
and
when
i
saw
ladies
of
your
honorable
condition
fleeing
on
the
quay
with
the
dalmatians
marching
on
one
side
and
a
mob
shouting
on
the
other
i
bethought
me
that
even
a
prison
might
be
welcome
thy
goodness
of
heart
did
not
mislead
thee
had
i
known
it
was
a
lady
of
the
tiepolo
i
should
have
been
even
more
ready
for
there
are
few
of
that
great
name
now
left
to
do
us
honor
violetta
curtsied
to
the
compliment
but
she
seemed
uneasy
that
haste
and
pride
of
rank
had
led
her
so
indiscreetly
to
betray
herself
canst
thou
not
lead
us
to
some
place
less
public
she
asked
observing
that
her
conductor
had
stopped
in
a
public
corridor
to
make
this
explanation
here
you
will
be
retired
as
in
your
own
palaces
great
ladies
answered
gelsomina
turning
into
a
private
passage
and
leading
the
way
towards
the
rooms
of
her
family
from
a
window
of
which
she
had
first
witnessed
the
embarrassment
of
her
guests
none
enter
here
without
cause
but
my
father
and
myself
and
my
father
is
much
occupied
with
his
charge
hast
thou
no
domestic
none
lady
a
daughter
should
not
be
too
proud
to
serve
herself
thou
sayest
well
one
of
thy
discretion
good
gelsomina
must
know
it
is
not
seemly
for
females
of
condition
to
be
thrown
within
walls
like
these
even
by
accident
and
thou
wilt
do
us
much
favor
by
taking
more
than
common
means
to
be
certain
that
we
are
unseen
we
give
thee
much
trouble
but
it
shall
not
go
unrequited
here
is
gold
gelsomina
did
not
answer
but
as
she
stood
with
her
eyes
cast
to
the
floor
the
color
stole
to
her
cheeks
until
her
usually
bloodless
face
was
in
a
soft
glow
nay
i
have
mistaken
thy
character
said
donna
florinda
secreting
the
sequins
and
taking
the
unresisting
hand
of
the
silent
girl
if
i
have
pained
thee
by
my
indiscretion
attribute
the
offer
to
our
dread
of
the
disgrace
of
being
seen
in
this
place
the
glow
deepened
and
the
lips
of
the
girl
quivered
is
it
then
a
disgrace
to
be
innocently
within
these
walls
lady
she
asked
still
with
an
averted
eye
i
have
long
suspected
this
but
none
has
ever
before
said
it
in
my
hearing
holy
maria
pardon
me
if
i
have
uttered
a
syllable
to
pain
thee
excellent
girl
it
has
been
unwittingly
and
without
intention
we
are
poor
lady
and
the
needy
must
submit
to
do
that
which
their
wishes
might
lead
them
to
avoid
i
understand
your
feelings
and
will
make
sure
of
your
being
secret
and
blessed
maria
will
pardon
a
greater
sin
than
any
you
have
committed
here
while
the
ladies
were
wondering
at
witnessing
such
proofs
of
delicacy
and
feeling
in
so
singular
a
place
the
girl
withdrew
i
had
not
expected
this
in
a
prison
exclaimed
violetta
as
all
is
not
noble
or
just
in
a
palace
neither
is
all
to
be
condemned
unheard
that
we
find
in
a
prison
but
this
is
in
sooth
an
extraordinary
girl
for
her
condition
and
we
are
indebted
to
blessed
theodore
crossing
herself
for
putting
her
in
our
way
can
we
do
better
than
by
making
her
a
confidante
and
a
friend
the
governess
was
older
and
less
disposed
than
her
pupil
to
confide
in
appearances
but
the
more
ardent
mind
and
superior
rank
of
the
latter
had
given
her
an
influence
that
the
former
did
not
always
successfully
resist
gelsomina
returned
before
there
was
time
to
discuss
the
prudence
of
what
violetta
had
proposed
thou
hast
a
father
gelsomina
asked
the
venetian
heiress
taking
the
hand
of
the
gentle
girl
as
she
put
her
question
holy
maria
be
praised
i
have
still
that
happiness
it
is
a
happiness
for
surely
a
father
would
not
have
the
heart
to
sell
his
own
child
to
ambition
and
mercenary
hopes
and
thy
mother
has
long
been
lady
i
believe
we
should
not
have
been
here
but
we
have
no
other
place
so
suitable
for
her
sufferings
as
this
jail
gelsomina
thou
art
happier
than
i
even
in
thy
prison
i
am
fatherless
motherless
i
could
almost
say
friendless
and
this
from
a
lady
of
the
tiepolo
all
is
not
as
it
seems
in
this
evil
world
kind
gelsomina
we
have
had
many
doges
but
we
have
had
much
suffering
thou
mayest
have
heard
that
the
house
of
which
i
come
is
reduced
to
a
single
youthful
girl
like
thyself
who
has
been
left
in
the
senate
charge
they
speak
little
of
these
matters
lady
in
venice
and
of
all
here
none
go
so
seldom
into
the
square
as
i
still
have
i
heard
of
the
beauty
and
riches
of
donna
violetta
the
last
i
hope
is
true
the
first
i
now
see
is
so
the
daughter
of
tiepolo
colored
in
turn
but
it
was
not
in
resentment
they
have
spoken
in
too
much
kindness
for
an
orphan
she
answered
though
that
fatal
wealth
is
perhaps
not
thou
knowest
that
the
state
charges
itself
with
the
care
and
establishment
of
all
noble
females
whom
providence
has
left
fatherless
lady
i
did
not
it
is
kind
of
mark
to
do
it
thou
wilt
think
differently
anon
thou
art
young
gelsomina
and
hast
passed
thy
time
in
privacy
true
lady
it
is
seldom
i
go
further
than
my
mother
room
or
the
cell
of
some
suffering
prisoner
violetta
looked
towards
her
governess
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
that
she
anticipated
her
appeal
would
be
made
in
vain
to
one
so
little
exposed
to
the
feelings
of
the
world
thou
wilt
not
understand
then
that
a
noble
female
may
have
little
inclination
to
comply
with
all
the
senate
wishes
in
disposing
of
her
duties
and
affections
gelsomina
gazed
at
the
fair
speaker
but
it
was
evident
that
she
did
not
clearly
comprehend
the
question
again
violetta
looked
at
the
governess
as
if
asking
aid
the
duties
of
our
sex
are
often
painful
said
donna
florinda
understanding
the
appeal
with
female
instinct
our
attachments
may
not
always
follow
the
wishes
of
our
friends
we
may
not
choose
but
we
can
not
always
obey
i
have
heard
that
noble
ladies
are
not
suffered
to
see
those
to
whom
they
are
to
be
wedded
signora
if
that
is
what
your
eccellenza
means
and
to
me
the
custom
has
always
seemed
unjust
if
not
cruel
and
are
females
of
thy
class
permitted
to
make
friends
among
those
who
may
become
dearer
at
any
other
day
asked
violetta
lady
we
have
that
much
freedom
even
in
the
prisons
then
art
thou
happier
than
those
of
the
palaces
i
will
trust
thee
generous
girl
for
thou
canst
not
be
unfaithful
to
the
weakness
and
wrongs
of
thy
sex
gelsomina
raised
a
hand
as
if
to
stop
the
impetuous
confidence
of
her
guest
and
then
she
listened
intently
few
enter
here
she
said
but
there
are
many
ways
of
learning
secrets
within
these
walls
which
are
still
unknown
to
me
come
deeper
into
the
rooms
noble
ladies
for
here
is
a
place
that
i
have
reason
to
think
is
safe
even
from
listeners
the
keeper
daughter
led
the
way
into
the
little
room
in
which
she
was
accustomed
to
converse
with
jacopo
you
were
saying
lady
that
i
had
a
feeling
for
the
weakness
and
helplessness
of
our
sex
and
surely
you
did
me
justice
violetta
had
leisure
to
reflect
an
instant
in
passing
from
one
room
to
the
other
and
she
began
her
communications
with
more
reserve
but
the
sensitive
interest
that
a
being
of
the
gentle
nature
and
secluded
habits
of
gelsomina
took
in
her
narrative
won
upon
her
own
natural
frankness
and
in
a
manner
nearly
imperceptible
to
herself
she
made
the
daughter
mistress
of
most
of
the
circumstances
under
which
she
had
entered
the
prison
the
cheek
of
gelsomina
became
colorless
as
she
listened
and
when
donna
violetta
ceased
every
limb
of
her
slight
frame
trembled
with
interest
the
senate
is
a
fearful
power
to
resist
she
said
speaking
so
low
as
hardly
to
be
audible
have
you
reflected
lady
on
the
chances
of
what
you
do
if
i
have
not
it
is
now
too
late
to
change
my
intentions
i
am
the
wife
of
the
duke
of
sant
agata
and
can
never
wed
another
gesu
this
is
true
and
yet
methinks
i
would
choose
to
die
a
nun
rather
than
offend
the
council
thou
knowest
not
good
girl
to
what
courage
the
heart
of
even
a
young
wife
is
equal
thou
art
still
bound
to
thy
father
in
the
instruction
and
habits
of
childhood
but
thou
mayest
live
to
know
that
all
thy
hopes
will
centre
in
another
gelsomina
ceased
to
tremble
and
her
mild
eye
brightened
the
council
is
terrible
she
answered
but
it
must
be
more
terrible
to
desert
one
to
whom
you
have
vowed
duty
and
love
at
the
altar
hast
thou
the
means
of
concealing
us
kind
girl
interrupted
donna
florinda
and
canst
thou
when
this
tumult
shall
be
quieted
in
any
manner
help
us
to
further
secresy
or
flight
lady
i
have
none
even
the
streets
and
squares
of
venice
are
nearly
strangers
to
me
santissima
maria
what
would
i
give
to
know
the
ways
of
the
town
as
well
as
my
cousin
annina
who
passes
at
will
from
her
father
shop
to
the
lido
and
from
mark
to
the
rialto
as
her
pleasure
suits
i
will
send
for
my
cousin
who
will
counsel
us
in
this
fearful
strait
thy
cousin
hast
thou
a
cousin
named
annina
lady
annina
my
mother
sister
child
the
daughter
of
a
called
tomaso
torti
do
the
noble
dames
of
the
city
take
such
heed
of
their
inferiors
this
will
charm
my
cousin
for
she
has
great
desires
to
be
noted
by
the
great
and
does
thy
cousin
come
hither
rarely
lady
we
are
not
of
much
intimacy
i
suppose
annina
finds
a
girl
simple
and
uninstructed
as
i
unworthy
of
her
company
but
she
will
not
refuse
to
aid
us
in
a
danger
like
this
i
know
she
little
loves
the
republic
for
we
have
had
words
on
its
acts
and
my
cousin
has
been
bolder
of
speech
about
them
than
befits
one
of
her
years
in
this
prison
gelsomina
thy
cousin
is
a
secret
agent
of
the
police
and
unworthy
of
thy
confidence
lady
i
do
not
speak
without
reason
trust
me
she
is
employed
in
duties
that
are
unbecoming
her
sex
and
unworthy
of
thy
confidence
noble
dames
i
will
not
say
anything
to
do
displeasure
to
your
high
rank
and
present
distress
but
you
should
not
urge
me
to
think
thus
of
my
mother
niece
you
have
been
unhappy
and
you
may
have
cause
to
dislike
the
republic
and
you
are
safe
here
but
i
do
not
desire
to
hear
annina
censured
both
donna
florinda
and
her
less
experienced
pupil
knew
enough
of
human
nature
to
consider
this
generous
incredulity
as
a
favorable
sign
of
the
integrity
of
her
who
manifested
it
and
they
wisely
contented
themselves
with
stipulating
that
annina
should
on
no
account
be
made
acquainted
with
their
situation
after
this
understanding
the
three
discussed
more
leisurely
the
prospect
of
the
fugitives
being
able
to
quit
the
place
when
ready
without
detection
at
the
suggestion
of
the
governess
a
servitor
of
the
prison
was
sent
out
by
gelsomina
to
observe
the
state
of
the
square
he
was
particularly
charged
though
in
a
manner
to
avoid
suspicion
to
search
for
a
carmelite
of
the
order
of
the
friars
on
his
return
the
menial
reported
that
the
mob
had
quitted
the
court
of
the
palace
and
was
gone
to
the
cathedral
with
the
body
of
the
fisherman
who
had
so
unexpectedly
gained
the
prize
in
the
regatta
of
the
preceding
day
repeat
your
aves
and
go
to
sleep
bella
gelsomina
concluded
the
for
the
fishermen
have
left
off
shouting
to
say
their
prayers
per
diana
the
and
rascals
are
as
impudent
as
if
mark
were
their
inheritance
the
noble
patricians
should
give
them
a
lesson
in
modesty
by
sending
every
tenth
knave
among
them
to
the
galleys
miscreants
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
an
orderly
town
with
their
vulgar
complaints
but
thou
hast
said
nothing
of
the
friar
is
he
with
the
rioters
there
is
a
carmelite
at
the
altar
but
my
blood
boiled
at
seeing
such
vagabonds
disturb
the
peace
of
respectable
persons
and
i
took
little
note
of
his
air
or
years
then
thou
failedst
to
do
the
errand
on
which
i
sent
thee
it
is
now
too
late
to
repair
thy
fault
thou
canst
return
to
thy
charge
a
million
pardons
bellissima
gelsomina
but
indignation
is
the
uppermost
feeling
when
one
in
office
sees
his
rights
attacked
by
the
multitude
send
me
to
corfu
or
to
candia
if
you
please
and
i
will
bring
back
the
color
of
every
stone
in
their
prisons
but
do
not
send
me
among
rebels
my
gorge
rises
at
the
sight
of
villany
as
the
keeper
daughter
withdrew
while
her
father
assistant
was
making
this
protestation
of
loyalty
the
latter
was
compelled
to
give
vent
to
the
rest
of
his
indignation
in
a
soliloquy
one
of
the
tendencies
of
oppression
is
to
create
a
scale
of
tyranny
descending
from
those
who
rule
a
state
to
those
who
domineer
over
a
single
individual
he
who
has
been
much
accustomed
to
view
men
need
not
be
told
that
none
are
so
arrogant
with
their
inferiors
as
those
who
are
oppressed
by
their
superiors
for
poor
human
nature
has
a
secret
longing
to
revenge
itself
on
the
weak
for
all
the
injuries
it
receives
from
the
strong
on
the
other
hand
no
class
is
so
willing
to
render
that
deference
when
unexacted
which
is
the
proper
meed
of
virtue
and
experience
and
intelligence
as
he
who
knows
that
he
is
fortified
on
every
side
against
innovations
on
his
natural
rights
thus
it
is
that
there
is
more
security
against
popular
violence
and
popular
insults
in
these
free
states
than
in
any
other
country
on
earth
for
there
is
scarcely
a
citizen
so
debased
as
not
to
feel
that
in
assuming
the
appearance
of
a
wish
to
revenge
the
chances
of
fortune
he
is
making
an
undue
admission
of
inferiority
though
the
torrent
may
be
pent
up
and
dammed
by
art
it
is
with
the
constant
hazard
of
breaking
down
the
unnatural
barriers
but
left
to
its
own
course
it
will
become
the
tranquil
and
the
deep
stream
until
it
finally
throws
off
its
superfluous
waters
into
the
common
receptacle
of
the
ocean
when
gelsomina
returned
to
her
visitors
it
was
with
a
report
favorable
to
their
tranquillity
the
riot
in
the
court
of
the
palace
and
the
movement
of
the
dalmatians
had
drawn
all
eyes
in
another
direction
and
although
some
errant
gaze
might
have
witnessed
their
entrance
into
the
gate
of
the
prison
it
was
so
natural
a
circumstance
that
no
one
would
suspect
females
of
their
appearance
of
remaining
there
an
instant
longer
than
was
necessary
the
momentary
absence
of
the
few
servants
of
the
prison
who
took
little
heed
of
those
who
entered
the
open
parts
of
the
building
and
who
had
been
drawn
away
by
curiosity
completed
their
security
the
humble
room
they
were
in
was
exclusively
devoted
to
the
use
of
their
gentle
protector
and
there
was
scarcely
a
possibility
of
interruption
until
the
council
had
obtained
the
leisure
and
the
means
of
making
use
of
those
terrible
means
which
rarely
left
anything
it
wished
to
know
concealed
with
this
explanation
donna
violetta
and
her
companion
were
greatly
satisfied
it
left
them
leisure
to
devise
means
for
their
flight
and
kindled
a
hope
in
the
former
of
being
speedily
restored
to
don
camillo
still
there
existed
the
cruel
embarrassment
of
not
possessing
the
means
of
acquainting
the
latter
with
their
situation
as
the
tumult
ceased
they
resolved
to
seek
a
boat
avored
by
such
disguises
as
the
means
of
gelsomina
could
supply
and
to
row
to
his
palace
but
reflection
convinced
donna
florinda
of
the
danger
of
such
a
step
since
the
neapolitan
was
known
to
be
surrounded
by
the
agents
of
the
police
accident
which
is
more
effectual
than
stratagem
in
defeating
intrigues
had
thrown
them
into
a
place
of
momentary
security
and
it
would
be
to
lose
the
of
their
situation
to
cast
themselves
without
the
utmost
caution
into
the
hazards
of
the
public
canals
at
length
the
governess
bethought
her
of
turning
the
services
of
the
gentle
creature
who
had
already
shown
so
much
sympathy
in
their
behalf
to
account
during
the
revelations
of
her
pupil
the
feminine
instinct
of
donna
florinda
had
enabled
her
to
discover
the
secret
springs
which
moved
the
unpractised
feelings
of
their
auditor
gelsomina
had
listened
to
the
manner
in
which
don
camillo
had
thrown
himself
into
the
canal
to
save
the
life
of
violetta
with
breathless
admiration
her
countenance
was
a
pure
reflection
of
her
thoughts
when
the
daughter
of
tiepolo
spoke
of
the
risks
he
had
run
to
gain
her
love
and
woman
glowed
in
every
lineament
of
her
mild
face
when
the
youthful
bride
touched
on
the
nature
of
the
engrossing
tie
which
had
united
them
and
which
was
far
too
holy
to
be
severed
by
the
senate
policy
if
we
had
the
means
of
getting
our
situation
to
the
ears
of
don
camillo
said
the
governess
all
might
yet
be
saved
else
will
this
happy
refuge
in
the
prison
avail
us
nothing
is
the
cavalier
of
too
stout
a
heart
to
shrink
before
those
up
above
demanded
gelsomina
he
would
summon
the
people
of
his
confidence
and
ere
the
dawn
of
day
we
might
still
be
beyond
their
power
those
calculating
senators
will
deal
with
the
vows
of
my
pupil
as
if
they
were
childish
oaths
and
set
the
anger
of
the
holy
see
itself
at
defiance
when
there
is
question
of
their
interest
but
the
sacrament
of
marriage
is
not
of
man
that
at
least
they
will
respect
believe
it
not
there
is
no
obligation
so
solemn
as
to
be
respected
when
their
policy
is
concerned
what
are
the
wishes
of
a
girl
or
what
the
happiness
of
a
solitary
and
helpless
female
to
their
fortunes
that
my
charge
is
young
is
a
reason
why
their
wisdom
should
interfere
though
it
is
none
to
touch
their
hearts
with
the
reflection
that
the
misery
to
which
they
would
condemn
her
is
to
last
the
longer
they
take
no
account
of
the
solemn
obligations
of
gratitude
the
ties
of
affection
are
so
many
means
of
working
upon
the
fears
of
those
they
rule
but
none
for
forbearance
and
they
laugh
at
the
devotedness
of
woman
love
as
a
folly
to
amuse
their
leisure
or
to
take
off
the
edge
of
disappointment
in
graver
concerns
can
anything
be
more
grave
than
wedlock
lady
to
them
it
is
important
as
it
furnishes
the
means
of
perpetuating
their
honors
and
their
proud
names
beyond
this
the
council
looks
little
at
domestic
interests
they
are
fathers
and
husbands
true
for
to
be
legally
the
first
they
must
become
the
last
marriage
to
them
is
not
a
tie
of
sacred
and
dear
affinity
but
the
means
of
increasing
their
riches
and
of
sustaining
their
names
continued
the
governess
watching
the
effect
of
her
words
on
the
countenance
of
the
guileless
girl
they
call
marriages
of
affection
children
games
and
they
deal
with
the
wishes
of
their
own
daughters
as
they
would
traffic
with
their
commodities
of
commerce
when
a
state
sets
up
an
idol
of
gold
as
its
god
few
will
refuse
to
sacrifice
at
its
altar
i
would
i
might
serve
the
noble
donna

thou
art
too
young
good

can
do
my

like
another
in
a
good
cause
if
it
were
possible
to
convey
to
don
camillo
monforte
a
knowledge
of
our
situation
but
thou
art
too
inexperienced
for
the
service
believe
it
not
signora
interrupted
the
generous
gelsomina
whose
pride
began
to
stimulate
her
natural
sympathies
with
one
so
near
her
own
age
and
one
too
like
herself
subject
to
that
passion
which
engrosses
a
female
heart
i
may
be
apter
than
my
appearance
would
give
reason
to
think
i
will
trust
thee
kind
girl
and
if
the
sainted
virgin
protects
us
thy
fortunes
shall
not
be
forgotten
the
pious
gelsomina
crossed
herself
and
first
acquainting
her
companions
with
her
intentions
she
went
within
to
prepare
herself
while
donna
florinda
penned
a
note
in
terms
so
guarded
as
to
defy
detection
in
the
event
of
accident
but
which
might
suffice
to
let
the
lord
of
agata
understand
their
present
situation
in
a
few
minutes
the
keeper
daughter
reappeared
her
ordinary
attire
which
was
that
of
a
modest
venetian
maiden
of
humble
condition
needed
no
concealment
and
the
mask
an
article
of
dress
which
none
in
that
city
were
without
effectually
disguised
her
features
she
then
received
the
note
with
the
name
of
the
street
and
the
palace
she
was
to
seek
a
description
of
the
person
of
the
neapolitan
with
cautions
to
be
wary
and
departed
chapter
xxiv
which
is
the
wiser
here
justice
or
iniquity
measure
for
measure
in
the
constant
struggle
between
the
innocent
and
the
artful
the
latter
have
the
advantage
so
long
as
they
confine
themselves
to
familiar
interests
but
the
moment
the
former
conquer
their
disgust
for
the
study
of
vice
and
throw
themselves
upon
the
protection
of
their
own
high
principles
they
are
far
more
effectually
concealed
from
the
calculations
of
their
adversaries
than
if
they
practised
the
most
refined
of
their
subtle
expedients
nature
has
given
to
every
man
enough
of
frailty
to
enable
him
to
estimate
the
workings
of
selfishness
and
fraud
but
her
truly
privileged
are
those
who
can
shroud
their
motives
and
intentions
in
a
degree
of
justice
and
disinterestedness
which
surpass
the
calculations
of
the
designing
millions
may
bow
to
the
commands
of
a
conventional
right
but
few
indeed
are
they
who
know
how
to
choose
in
novel
and
difficult
cases
there
is
often
a
mystery
in
virtue
while
the
cunning
of
vice
is
no
more
than
a
pitiful
imitation
of
that
art
which
endeavors
to
cloak
its
workings
in
the
thin
veil
of
deception
the
other
in
some
degree
resembles
the
sublimity
of
infallible
truth
thus
men
too
much
practised
in
the
interests
of
life
constantly
overreach
themselves
when
brought
in
contact
with
the
simple
and
intelligent
and
the
experience
of
every
day
proves
that
as
there
is
no
fame
permanent
which
is
not
founded
on
virtue
so
there
is
no
policy
secure
which
is
not
bottomed
on
the
good
of
the
whole
vulgar
minds
may
control
the
concerns
of
a
community
so
long
as
they
arc
limited
to
vulgar
views
but
woe
to
the
people
who
confide
on
great
emergencies
in
any
but
the
honest
the
noble
the
wise
and
the
philanthropic
for
there
is
no
security
for
success
when
the
meanly
artful
control
the
occasional
and
providential
events
which
regenerate
a
nation
more
than
half
the
misery
which
has
defeated
as
well
as
disgraced
civilization
proceeds
from
neglecting
to
use
those
great
men
that
are
always
created
by
great
occasions
treating
as
we
are
of
the
vices
of
the
venetian
system
our
pen
has
run
truant
with
its
subject
since
the
application
of
the
moral
must
be
made
on
the
familiar
scale
suited
to
the
incidents
of
our
story
it
has
already
been
seen
that
gelsomina
was
intrusted
with
certain
important
keys
of
the
prison
for
this
trust
there
had
been
sufficient
motive
with
the
wily
guardians
of
the
jail
who
had
made
their
calculations
on
her
serving
their
particular
orders
without
ever
suspecting
that
she
was
capable
of
so
far
listening
to
the
promptings
of
a
generous
temper
as
might
induce
her
to
use
them
in
any
manner
prejudicial
to
their
own
views
the
service
to
which
they
were
now
to
be
applied
proved
that
the
keepers
one
of
whom
was
her
own
father
had
not
fully
known
how
to
estimate
the
powers
of
the
innocent
and
simple
provided
with
the
keys
in
question
gelsomina
took
a
lamp
and
passed
upwards
from
the
mezzinino
in
which
she
dwelt
to
the
first
floor
of
the
edifice
instead
of
descending
to
its
court
door
was
opened
after
door
and
many
a
gloomy
corridor
was
passed
by
the
gentle
girl
with
the
confidence
of
one
who
knew
her
motive
to
be
good
she
soon
crossed
the
bridge
of
sighs
fearless
of
interruption
in
that
unfrequented
gallery
and
entered
the
palace
here
she
made
her
way
to
a
door
that
opened
on
the
common
and
public
vomitories
of
the
structure
moving
with
sufficient
care
to
make
impunity
from
detection
sure
she
extinguished
the
light
and
applied
the
key
at
the
next
instant
she
was
on
the
vast
and
gloomy
stairway
it
required
but
a
moment
to
descend
it
and
to
reach
the
covered
gallery
which
surrounded
the
court
a
halberdier
was
within
a
few
feet
of
her
he
looked
at
the
unknown
female
with
interest
but
as
it
was
not
his
business
to
question
those
who
issued
from
the
building
nothing
was
said
gelsomina
walked
on
a
but
vindictive
being
was
dropping
an
accusation
in
the
lion
mouth
gelsomina
stopped
involuntarily
until
the
secret
accuser
had
done
his
treacherous
work
and
departed
then
when
she
was
about
to
proceed
she
saw
that
the
halberdier
at
the
head
of
the
giant
stairway
was
smiling
at
her
indecision
like
one
accustomed
to
such
scenes
is
there
danger
in
quitting
the
palace
she
asked
of
the
rough
mountaineer
corpo
di
bacco
there
might
have
been
an
hour
since
bella
donna
but
the
rioters
are
muzzled
and
at
their
prayers
gelsomina
hesitated
no
longer
she
descended
the
well
known
flight
down
which
the
head
of
faliero
had
rolled
and
was
soon
beneath
the
arch
of
the
gate
here
the
timid
and
unpractised
maid
again
stopped
for
she
could
not
venture
into
the
square
without
assuring
herself
like
a
deer
about
to
quit
its
cover
of
the
tranquillity
of
the
place
into
which
she
was
to
enter
the
agents
of
the
police
had
been
too
much
alarmed
by
the
rising
of
the
fishermen
not
to
call
their
usual
ingenuity
and
finesse
into
play
the
moment
the
disturbance
was
appeased
money
had
been
given
to
the
mountebanks
and
ballad
singers
to
induce
them
to
reappear
and
groups
of
hirelings
some
in
masks
and
others
without
concealment
were
ostentatiously
assembled
in
different
parts
of
the
piazza
in
short
those
usual
expedients
were
resorted
to
which
are
constantly
used
to
restore
the
confidence
of
a
people
in
those
countries
in
which
civilization
is
so
new
that
they
are
not
yet
considered
sufficiently
advanced
to
be
the
guardians
of
their
own
security
there
are
few
artifices
so
shallow
that
many
will
not
be
their
dupes
the
idler
the
curious
the
really
discontented
the
factious
the
designing
with
a
suitable
mixture
of
the
unthinking
and
of
those
who
only
live
for
the
pleasure
of
the
passing
hour
a
class
not
the
least
insignificant
for
numbers
had
lent
themselves
to
the
views
of
the
police
and
when
gelsomina
was
ready
to
enter
the
piazzetta
she
found
both
the
squares
partly
filled
a
few
excited
fishermen
clustered
about
the
doors
of
the
cathedral
like
bees
swarming
before
their
hive
but
on
that
side
there
was
no
very
visible
cause
of
alarm
unaccustomed
as
she
was
to
scenes
like
that
before
her
the
first
glance
assured
the
gentle
girl
of
the
real
privacy
which
so
singularly
distinguishes
the
solitude
of
a
crowd
gathering
her
simple
mantle
more
closely
about
her
form
and
settling
her
mask
with
care
she
moved
with
a
swift
step
into
the
centre
of
the
piazza
we
shall
not
detail
the
progress
of
our
heroine
as
avoiding
the
commonplace
gallantry
that
assailed
and
offended
her
ear
she
went
her
way
on
her
errand
of
kindness
young
active
and
impelled
by
her
intentions
the
square
was
soon
passed
and
she
reached
the
place
of
san
nico
here
was
one
of
the
landings
of
the
public
gondolas
but
at
the
moment
there
was
no
boat
in
waiting
for
curiosity
or
fear
had
induced
the
men
to
quit
their
usual
stand
gelsomina
had
ascended
the
bridge
and
was
on
the
crown
of
its
arch
when
a
gondolier
came
sweeping
lazily
in
from
the
direction
of
the
grand
canal
her
hesitation
and
doubting
manner
attracted
his
attention
and
the
man
made
the
customary
sign
which
conveyed
the
offer
of
his
services
as
she
was
nearly
a
stranger
in
the
streets
of
venice
labyrinths
that
offer
greater
embarrassment
to
the
uninitiated
than
perhaps
the
passages
of
any
other
town
of
its
size
she
gladly
availed
herself
of
the
offer
to
descend
to
the
steps
to
leap
into
the
boat
to
utter
the
word
rialto
and
to
conceal
herself
in
the
pavilion
was
the
business
of
a
minute
the
boat
was
instantly
in
motion
gelsomina
now
believed
herself
secure
of
effecting
her
purpose
since
there
was
little
to
apprehend
from
the
knowledge
or
the
designs
of
a
common
boatman
he
could
not
know
her
object
and
it
was
his
interest
to
carry
her
in
safety
to
the
place
she
had
commanded
but
so
important
was
success
that
she
could
not
feel
secure
of
attaining
it
while
it
was
still
unaccomplished
she
soon
summoned
sufficient
resolution
to
look
out
at
the
palaces
and
boats
they
were
passing
and
she
felt
the
refreshing
air
of
the
canal
revive
her
courage
then
turning
with
a
sensitive
distrust
to
examine
the
countenance
of
the
gondolier
she
saw
that
his
features
were
concealed
beneath
a
mask
that
was
so
well
designed
as
not
to
be
perceptible
to
a
casual
observer
by
moonlight
though
it
was
common
on
occasions
for
the
servants
of
the
great
it
was
not
usual
for
the
public
gondoliers
to
be
disguised
the
circumstance
itself
was
one
justly
to
excite
slight
apprehension
though
on
second
thoughts
gelsomina
saw
no
more
in
it
than
a
return
from
some
expedition
of
pleasure
or
some
serenade
perhaps
in
which
the
caution
of
a
lover
had
compelled
his
followers
to
resort
to
this
species
of
concealment
shall
i
put
you
on
the
public
quay
signora
demanded
the
gondolier
or
shall
i
see
you
to
the
gate
of
your
own
palace
the
heart
of
gelsomina
beat
high
she
liked
the
tone
of
the
voice
though
it
was
necessarily
smothered
by
the
mask
but
she
was
so
little
accustomed
to
act
in
the
affairs
of
others
and
less
still
in
any
of
so
great
interest
that
the
sounds
caused
her
to
tremble
like
one
less
worthily
employed
dost
thou
know
the
palace
of
a
certain
don
camillo
monforte
a
lord
of
calabria
who
dwells
here
in
venice
she
asked
after
a
moment
pause
the
gondolier
sensibly
betrayed
surprise
by
the
manner
in
which
he
started
at
the
question
would
you
be
rowed
there
lady
if
thou
art
certain
of
knowing
the
palazzo
the
water
stirred
and
the
gondola
glided
between
high
walls
gelsomina
knew
by
the
sound
that
they
were
in
one
of
the
smaller
canals
and
she
augured
well
of
the
boatman
knowledge
of
the
town
they
soon
stopped
by
the
side
of
a
and
the
man
appeared
on
the
step
holding
an
arm
to
aid
her
in
ascending
after
the
manner
of
people
of
his
craft
gelsomina
bade
him
wait
her
return
and
proceeded
there
was
a
marked
derangement
in
the
household
of
don
camillo
that
one
more
practised
than
our
heroine
would
have
noted
the
servants
seemed
undecided
in
the
manner
of
performing
the
most
ordinary
duties
their
looks
wandered
distrustfully
from
one
to
another
and
when
their
visitor
entered
the
vestibule
though
all
arose
none
advanced
to
meet
her
a
female
masked
was
not
a
rare
sight
in
venice
for
few
of
that
sex
went
upon
the
canals
without
using
the
customary
means
of
concealment
but
it
would
seem
by
their
hesitating
manner
that
the
menials
of
don
camillo
did
not
view
the
entrance
of
her
who
now
appeared
with
the
usual
indifference
i
am
in
the
dwelling
of
the
duke
of
agata
a
signore
of
calabria
demanded
gelsomina
who
saw
the
necessity
of
being
firm
signora
si
is
your
lord
in
the
palace
signora
he
is
and
he
is
not
what
beautiful
lady
shall
i
tell
him
does
him
this
honor
if
he
be
not
at
home
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
tell
him
anything
if
he
is
i
could
wish
to
see
him
the
domestics
of
whom
there
were
several
put
their
heads
together
and
seemed
to
dispute
on
the
propriety
of
receiving
the
visit
at
this
instant
a
gondolier
in
a
flowered
jacket
entered
the
vestibule
gelsomina
took
courage
at
his
eye
and
frank
manner
do
you
serve
don
camillo
monforte
she
asked
as
he
passed
her
on
his
way
to
the
canal
with
the
oar
bellissima
donna
answered
gino
touching
his
cap
though
scarce
looking
aside
at
the
question
and
could
he
be
told
that
a
female
wishes
earnestly
to
speak
to
him
in
private
a
female
santa
maria
bella
donna
there
is
no
end
to
females
who
come
on
these
errands
in
venice
you
might
better
pay
a
visit
to
the
statue
of
san
teodore
in
the
piazza
than
see
my
master
at
this
moment
the
stone
will
give
you
the
better
reception
and
this
he
commands
you
to
tell
all
of
my
sex
who
come
diavolo
lady
you
are
particular
in
your
questions
perhaps
my
master
might
on
a
strait
receive
one
of
the
sex
i
could
name
but
on
the
honor
of
a
gondolier
he
is
not
the
most
gallant
cavalier
of
venice
just
at
this
moment
if
there
is
one
to
whom
he
would
pay
this
deference
you
are
bold
for
a
servitor
how
know
you
i
am
not
that
one
gino
started
he
examined
the
figure
of
the
applicant
and
lifting
his
cap
he
bowed
lady
i
do
not
know
anything
about
it
he
said
you
may
be
his
highness
the
doge
or
the
ambassador
of
the
emperor
i
pretend
to
know
nothing
in
venice
of
late
the
words
of
gino
were
cut
short
by
a
tap
on
the
shoulder
from
the
public
gondolier
who
had
hastily
entered
the
vestibule
the
man
whispered
in
the
ear
of
don
camillo
servitor
this
is
not
a
moment
to
refuse
any
he
said
let
the
stranger
go
up
gino
hesitated
no
longer
with
the
decision
of
a
favored
menial
he
pushed
the
groom
of
the
chambers
aside
and
offered
to
conduct
gelsomina
himself
to
the
presence
of
his
master
as
they
ascended
the
stairs
three
of
the
inferior
servants
disappeared
the
palace
of
don
camillo
had
an
air
of
more
than
venetian
gloom
the
rooms
were
dimly
lighted
many
of
the
walls
had
been
stripped
of
the
most
precious
of
their
pictures
and
in
other
respects
a
jealous
eye
might
have
detected
evidence
of
a
secret
intention
on
the
part
of
its
owner
not
to
make
a
permanent
residence
of
the
dwelling
but
these
were
particulars
that
gelsomina
did
not
note
as
she
followed
gino
through
the
apartments
into
the
more
private
parts
of
the
building
here
the
gondolier
unlocked
a
door
and
regarding
his
companion
with
an
air
he
made
a
sign
for
her
to
enter
my
master
commonly
receives
the
ladies
here
he
said
enter
eccellenza
while
i
run
to
tell
him
of
his
happiness
gelsomina
did
not
hesitate
though
she
felt
a
violent
throb
at
the
heart
when
she
heard
the
key
turning
in
the
lock
behind
her
she
was
in
an
and
inferring
from
the
light
which
shone
through
the
door
of
an
adjoining
room
that
she
was
to
proceed
she
went
on
no
sooner
had
she
entered
the
little
closet
than
she
found
herself
alone
with
one
of
her
own
sex
annina
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
unpractised
under
the
impulse
of
surprise
gelsomina
the
simple
quiet
whispering
modest
gelsomina
returned
the
other
the
words
of
annina
admitted
but
of
one
construction
wounded
like
the
bruised
sensitive
plant
gelsomina
withdrew
her
mask
for
air
actually
gasping
for
breath
between
offended
pride
and
wonder
thou
here
she
added
scarce
she
uttered
thou
here
repeated
annina
with
such
a
laugh
as
escapes
the
degraded
when
they
believe
the
innocent
reduced
to
their
own
level
nay
i
come
on
an
errand
of
pity
santa
maria
we
are
both
here
with
the
same
end
annina
i
know
not
what
thou
say
this
is
surely
the
palace
of
don
camillo
monforte
a
noble
neapolitan
who
urges
claims
to
the
honors
of
the
senate
the
gayest
the
handsomest
the
richest
and
the
most
inconstant
cavalier
in
venice
hadst
thou
been
here
a
thousand
times
thou
not
be
better
informed
gelsomina
listened
in
horror
her
artful
cousin
who
knew
her
character
to
the
full
extent
that
vice
can
comprehend
innocence
watched
her
colorless
cheek
and
contracting
eye
with
secret
triumph
at
the
first
moment
she
had
believed
all
that
she
insinuated
but
second
thoughts
and
a
view
of
the
visible
distress
of
the
frightened
girl
gave
a
new
direction
to
her
suspicions
but
i
tell
thee
nothing
new
she
quickly
added
i
only
regret
thou
find
me
where
no
doubt
you
expected
to
meet
the
duca
di
sant
agata
himself
annina
this
from
thee
thou
surely
didst
not
come
to
his
palace
to
seek
thy
cousin
gelsomina
had
long
been
familiar
with
grief
but
until
this
moment
she
had
never
felt
the
deep
humiliation
of
shame
tears
started
from
her
eyes
and
she
sank
back
into
a
seat
in
utter
inability
to
stand
i
would
not
distress
thee
out
of
bearing
added
the
artful
daughter
of
the
but
that
we
are
both
in
the
closet
of
the
gayest
cavalier
of
venice
is
beyond
dispute
i
have
told
thee
that
pity
for
another
brought
me
hither
pity
for
don
camillo
for
a
noble
lady
a
young
a
virtuous
and
a
beautiful
wife
a
daughter
of
the
tiepolo
of
the
tiepolo
annina
why
should
a
lady
of
the
tiepolo
employ
a
girl
of
the
public
prisons
why
because
there
has
been
injustice
by
those
up
above
there
has
been
a
tumult
among
the
fishermen
and
the
lady
and
her
governess
were
liberated
by
the
rioters
and
his
highness
spoke
to
them
in
the
great
court
and
the
dalmatians
were
on
the
quay
and
the
prison
was
a
refuge
for
ladies
of
their
quality
in
a
moment
of
so
great
terror
and
the
holy
church
itself
has
blessed
their
love
gelsomina
could
utter
no
more
but
breathless
with
the
wish
to
vindicate
herself
and
wounded
to
the
soul
by
the
strange
embarrassment
of
her
situation
she
sobbed
aloud
incoherent
as
had
been
her
language
she
had
said
enough
to
remove
every
doubt
from
the
mind
of
annina
privy
to
the
secret
marriage
to
the
rising
of
the
fishermen
and
to
the
departure
of
the
ladies
from
the
convent
on
a
distant
island
where
they
had
been
carried
on
quitting
their
own
palace
the
preceding
night
and
whither
she
had
been
compelled
to
conduct
don
camillo
who
had
ascertained
the
departure
of
those
he
sought
without
discovering
their
destination
the
daughter
of
the
readily
comprehended
not
only
the
errand
of
her
cousin
but
the
precise
situation
of
the
fugitives
and
thou
believest
this
fiction
gelsomina
she
said
affecting
pity
for
her
cousin
credulity
the
characters
of
thy
pretended
daughter
of
tiepolo
and
her
governess
are
no
secrets
to
those
who
frequent
the
piazza
of
san
marco
hadst
thou
seen
the
beauty
and
innocence
of
the
lady
annina
thou
not
say
this
blessed
san
teodoro
what
is
more
beautiful
than
vice
is
the
cheapest
artifice
of
the
devil
to
deceive
frail
sinners
this
thou
hast
heard
of
thy
confessor
gelsomina
or
he
is
of
much
lighter
discourse
than
mine
but
why
should
a
woman
of
this
life
enter
the
prisons
they
had
good
reasons
to
dread
the
dalmatians
no
doubt
but
it
is
in
my
power
to
tell
thee
more
of
these
thou
hast
entertained
with
such
peril
to
thine
own
reputation
there
are
women
in
venice
who
discredit
their
sex
in
various
ways
and
of
these
more
particularly
she
who
calls
herself
florinda
is
notorious
for
her
agency
in
robbing
mark
of
his
revenue
she
has
received
a
largess
from
the
neapolitan
of
wines
grown
on
his
calabrian
mountains
and
wishing
to
tamper
with
my
honesty
she
offered
the
liquor
to
me
expecting
one
like
me
to
forget
my
duty
and
to
aid
her
in
deceiving
the
republic
can
this
be
true
annina
why
should
i
deceive
thee
are
we
not
sisters
children
and
though
affairs
on
the
lido
keep
me
much
from
thy
company
is
not
the
love
between
us
natural
i
complained
to
the
authorities
and
the
liquors
were
seized
and
the
pretended
noble
ladies
were
obliged
to
hide
themselves
this
very
day
is
thought
they
wish
to
flee
the
city
with
their
profligate
neapolitan
driven
to
take
shelter
they
have
sent
thee
to
acquaint
him
with
their
in
order
that
he
may
come
to
their
aid
and
why
art
thou
here
annina
i
marvel
that
thou
didst
not
put
the
question
sooner
gino
the
gondolier
of
don
camillo
has
long
been
an
unfavored
suitor
of
mine
and
when
this
florinda
complained
of
my
having
what
every
honest
girl
in
venice
should
do
exposed
her
fraud
to
the
authorities
she
advised
his
master
to
seize
me
partly
in
revenge
and
partly
with
the
vain
hope
of
making
me
retract
the
complaint
i
have
made
thou
hast
heard
of
the
bold
violence
of
these
cavaliers
when
thwarted
in
their
wills
annina
then
related
the
manner
of
her
seizure
with
sufficient
exactitude
merely
concealing
those
facts
that
it
was
not
her
interest
to
reveal
but
there
is
a
lady
of
the
tiepolo
annina
as
sure
as
there
are
cousins
like
ourselves
santa
madre
di
dio
that
woman
so
treacherous
and
so
bold
should
have
met
one
of
thy
innocence
it
would
have
been
better
had
they
fallen
in
with
me
who
am
too
ignorant
for
their
cunning
blessed
anna
knows
but
who
have
not
to
learn
their
true
characters
they
did
speak
of
thee
annina
the
glance
which
the
daughter
threw
at
her
cousin
was
such
as
the
treacherous
serpent
casts
at
the
bird
but
preserving
her
she
added
not
to
my
favor
it
would
sicken
me
to
hear
words
of
favor
from
such
as
they
they
are
not
thy
friends
annina
perhaps
they
told
thee
child
that
i
was
in
the
employment
of
the
council
indeed
they
did
no
wonder
your
dishonest
people
can
never
believe
one
can
do
an
act
of
pure
conscience
but
here
comes
the
note
the
libertine
gelsomina
and
thou
wilt
feel
for
him
the
same
disgust
as
i
the
door
opened
and
don
camillo
monforte
entered
there
was
an
appearance
of
distrust
in
his
manner
which
proved
that
he
did
not
expect
to
meet
his
bride
gelsomina
arose
and
though
bewildered
by
the
tale
of
her
cousin
and
her
own
previous
impressions
she
stood
resembling
a
meek
statue
of
modesty
awaiting
his
approach
the
neapolitan
was
evidently
struck
by
her
beauty
and
the
simplicity
of
her
air
but
his
brow
was
fixed
like
that
of
a
man
who
had
steeled
his
feelings
against
deceit
thou
see
me
he
said
i
had
that
wish
noble
signore
but
annina
seeing
another
thy
mind
hath
changed
signore
it
has
don
camillo
looked
at
her
earnestly
and
with
manly
regret
thou
art
young
for
thy
vocation
here
is
gold
retire
as
thou
but
hold
dost
thou
know
this
annina
she
is
my
mother
sister
daughter
noble
duca
per
diana
a
worthy
sisterhood
depart
together
for
i
have
no
need
of
either
but
mark
me
and
as
he
spoke
don
camillo
took
annina
by
the
arm
and
led
her
aside
when
he
continued
with
a
low
but
menacing
voice
thou
seest
i
am
to
be
feared
as
well
as
thy
councils
thou
canst
not
cross
the
threshold
of
thy
father
without
my
knowledge
if
prudent
thou
wilt
teach
thy
tongue
discretion
do
as
thou
wilt
i
fear
thee
not
but
remember
prudence
annina
made
an
humble
reverence
as
if
in
acknowledgment
of
the
wisdom
of
his
advice
and
taking
the
arm
of
her
cousin
she
again
curtsied
and
hurried
from
the
room
as
the
presence
of
their
master
in
his
closet
was
known
to
them
none
of
the
menials
presumed
to
stop
those
who
issued
from
the
privileged
room
gelsomina
who
was
even
more
impatient
than
her
wily
companion
to
escape
from
a
place
she
believed
polluted
was
nearly
breathless
when
she
reached
the
gondola
its
owner
was
in
waiting
on
the
steps
and
in
a
moment
the
boat
whirled
away
from
a
spot
which
both
of
those
it
contained
were
though
for
reasons
so
very
different
glad
to
quit
gelsomina
had
forgotten
her
mask
in
her
hurry
and
the
gondola
was
no
sooner
in
the
great
canal
than
she
put
her
face
at
the
window
of
the
pavilion
in
quest
of
the
evening
air
the
rays
of
the
moon
fell
upon
her
guileless
eye
and
a
cheek
that
was
now
glowing
partly
with
offended
pride
and
partly
with
joy
at
her
escape
from
a
situation
she
felt
to
be
so
degrading
her
forehead
was
touched
with
a
finger
and
turning
she
saw
the
gondolier
making
a
sign
of
caution
he
then
slowly
lifted
his
mask
carlo
had
half
burst
from
her
lips
but
another
sign
suppressed
the
cry
gelsomina
withdrew
her
head
and
after
her
beating
heart
had
ceased
to
throb
she
bowed
her
face
and
murmured
thanksgivings
at
finding
herself
at
such
a
moment
under
the
protection
of
one
who
possessed
all
her
confidence
the
gondolier
asked
no
orders
for
his
direction
the
boat
moved
on
taking
the
direction
of
the
port
which
appeared
perfectly
natural
to
the
two
females
annina
supposed
it
was
returning
to
the
square
the
place
she
would
have
sought
had
she
been
alone
and
gelsomina
who
believed
that
he
whom
she
called
carlo
toiled
regularly
as
a
gondolier
for
support
fancied
of
course
that
he
was
taking
her
to
her
ordinary
residence
but
though
the
innocent
can
endure
the
scorn
of
the
world
it
is
hard
indeed
to
be
suspected
by
those
they
love
all
that
annina
had
told
her
of
the
character
of
don
camillo
and
his
associates
came
gradually
across
the
mind
of
the
gentle
gelsomina
and
she
felt
the
blood
creeping
to
her
temples
as
she
saw
the
construction
her
lover
might
put
on
her
conduct
a
dozen
times
did
the
artless
girl
satisfy
herself
with
saying
inwardly
he
knows
me
and
will
believe
the
best
and
as
often
did
her
feelings
prompt
her
to
tell
the
truth
suspense
is
far
more
painful
at
such
moments
than
even
vindication
which
in
itself
is
a
humiliating
duty
to
the
virtuous
pretending
a
desire
to
breathe
the
air
she
left
her
cousin
in
the
canopy
annina
was
not
sorry
to
be
alone
for
she
had
need
to
reflect
on
all
the
windings
of
the
sinuous
path
on
which
she
had
entered
gelsomina
succeeded
in
passing
the
pavilion
and
in
gaining
the
side
of
the
gondolier
carlo
she
said
observing
that
he
continued
to
row
in
silence
gelsomina
thou
hast
not
questioned
me
i
know
thy
treacherous
cousin
and
can
believe
thou
art
her
dupe
the
moment
to
learn
the
truth
will
come
thou
didst
not
know
me
carlo
when
i
called
thee
from
the
bridge
i
did
not
any
fare
that
would
occupy
my
time
was
welcome
why
dost
thou
call
annina
treacherous
because
venice
does
not
hold
a
more
wily
heart
or
a
falser
tongue
gelsomina
remembered
the
warning
of
donna
florinda
possessed
of
the
advantage
of
blood
and
that
reliance
which
the
inexperienced
always
place
in
the
integrity
of
their
friends
until
exposure
comes
to
destroy
the
illusion
annina
had
found
it
easy
to
persuade
her
cousin
of
the
unworthiness
of
her
guests
but
here
was
one
who
had
all
her
sympathies
who
openly
denounced
annina
herself
in
such
a
dilemma
the
bewildered
girl
did
what
nature
and
her
feelings
suggested
she
recounted
in
a
low
but
rapid
voice
the
incidents
of
the
evening
and
annina
construction
of
the
conduct
of
the
females
whom
she
had
left
behind
in
the
prison
jacopo
listened
so
intently
that
his
oar
dragged
in
the
water
enough
he
said
when
gelsomina
blushing
with
her
own
earnestness
to
stand
exculpated
in
his
eyes
had
done
i
understand
it
all
distrust
thy
cousin
for
the
senate
itself
is
not
more
false
the
pretended
carlo
spoke
cautiously
but
in
a
firm
voice
gelsomina
took
his
meaning
though
wondering
at
what
she
heard
and
returned
to
annina
within
the
gondola
proceeded
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
chapter
xxv
enough
i
could
be
merry
now
hubert
i
love
thee
well
i
not
say
what
i
intend
for
thee
remember
king
john
jacopo
was
deeply
practised
in
the
windings
of
venetian
deceit
he
knew
how
unceasingly
the
eyes
of
the
councils
through
their
agents
were
on
the
movements
of
those
in
whom
they
took
an
interest
and
he
was
far
from
feeling
all
the
advantage
circumstances
had
seemingly
thrown
in
his
way
annina
was
certainly
in
his
power
and
it
was
not
possible
that
she
had
yet
communicated
the
intelligence
derived
from
gelsomina
to
any
of
her
employers
but
a
gesture
a
look
in
passing
the
the
appearance
of
duresse
or
an
exclamation
might
give
the
alarm
to
some
one
of
the
thousand
spies
of
the
police
the
disposal
of
annina
person
in
some
place
of
safety
therefore
became
the
first
and
the
most
material
act
to
return
to
the
palace
of
don
camillo
would
be
to
go
into
the
midst
of
the
hirelings
of
the
senate
and
although
the
neapolitan
relying
on
his
rank
and
influence
had
preferred
this
step
when
little
importance
was
attached
to
the
detention
of
the
girl
and
when
all
she
knew
had
been
revealed
the
case
was
altered
now
that
she
might
become
the
connecting
link
in
the
information
necessary
to
enable
the
officers
to
find
the
fugitives
the
gondola
moved
on
palace
after
palace
was
passed
and
the
impatient
annina
thrust
her
head
from
a
window
to
note
its
progress
they
came
among
the
shipping
of
the
port
and
her
uneasiness
sensibly
increased
making
pretext
similar
to
that
of
gelsomina
the
daughter
quitted
the
pavilion
to
steal
to
the
side
of
the
gondolier
i
would
be
landed
quickly
at
the
of
the
doge
palace
she
said
slipping
a
piece
of
silver
into
the
hand
of
the
boatman
you
shall
be
served
bella
donna
but
diamine
i
marvel
that
a
girl
of
thy
wit
should
not
scent
the
treasures
in
yonder
felucca
dost
thou
mean
the
sorrentine
what
other
padrone
brings
as
well
flavored
liquors
within
the
lido
quiet
thy
impatience
to
land
daughter
of
honest
old
maso
and
traffic
with
the
padrone
for
the
comfort
of
us
of
the
canals
how
thou
knowest
me
then
to
be
the
pretty
of
the
lido
corpo
di
bacco
thou
art
as
well
known
as
the
itself
to
us
gondoliers
why
art
thou
masked
thou
canst
not
be
luigi
it
is
little
matter
whether
i
am
called
luigi
or
enrico
or
giorgio
i
am
thy
customer
and
honor
the
shortest
hair
of
thy
eyebrows
thou
knowest
annina
that
the
young
patricians
have
their
frolics
and
they
swear
us
gondoliers
to
keep
secret
till
all
danger
of
detection
is
over
were
any
impertinent
eyes
following
me
i
might
be
questioned
as
to
the
manner
of
having
passed
the
earlier
hours
methinks
it
would
be
better
to
have
given
thee
gold
and
to
have
sent
thee
at
once
to
thy
home
to
be
followed
like
a
denounced
hebrew
to
my
door
when
i
have
confounded
my
boat
with
a
thousand
others
it
will
be
time
to
uncover
wilt
thou
to
the
bella
sorrentina
nay
is
not
necessary
to
ask
since
thou
takest
the
direction
of
thine
own
will
the
gondolier
laughed
and
nodded
his
head
as
if
he
would
give
his
companion
to
understand
that
he
was
master
of
her
secret
wishes
annina
was
hesitating
in
what
manner
she
should
make
him
change
his
purpose
when
the
gondola
touched
the
felucca
side
we
will
go
up
and
speak
to
the
padrone
whispered
jacopo
it
is
of
no
avail
he
is
without
liquors
trust
him
not
i
know
the
man
and
his
pretences
thou
forgettest
my
cousin
she
is
an
innocent
and
unsuspecting
child
jacopo
lifted
annina
as
he
spoke
on
the
deck
of
the
bella
sorrentina
in
a
manner
between
gallantry
and
force
and
leaped
after
her
without
pausing
or
suffering
her
to
rally
her
thoughts
he
led
her
to
the
cabin
stairs
which
she
descended
wondering
at
his
conduct
but
determined
not
to
betray
her
own
secret
wrongs
on
the
customs
to
a
stranger
stefano
milano
was
asleep
in
a
sail
on
deck
a
touch
aroused
him
and
a
sign
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
imaginary
roderigo
stood
before
him
a
thousand
pardons
signore
said
the
gaping
mariner
is
the
freight
come
in
part
only
i
have
brought
thee
a
certain
annina
torti
the
daughter
of
old
tommaso
torti
a
of
the
lido
santa
madre
does
the
senate
think
it
necessary
to
send
one
like
her
from
the
city
in
secret
it
does
and
it
lays
great
stress
on
her
detention
i
have
come
hither
with
her
without
suspicion
of
my
object
and
she
has
been
prevailed
on
to
enter
thy
cabin
under
a
pretence
of
some
secret
dealings
in
wines
according
to
our
former
understanding
it
will
be
thy
business
to
make
sure
of
her
presence
that
is
easily
done
returned
stefano
stepping
forward
and
closing
the
which
he
secured
by
a
bolt
she
is
alone
now
with
the
image
of
our
lady
and
a
better
occasion
to
repeat
her
aves
can
not
offer
this
is
well
if
thou
canst
keep
her
so
it
is
now
time
to
lift
thy
anchors
and
to
go
beyond
the
tiers
of
the
vessels
with
the
felucca
signore
there
wants
but
five
minutes
for
that
duty
since
we
are
ready
then
perform
it
in
all
speed
for
much
depends
on
the
management
of
this
delicate
duty
i
will
be
with
thee
anon
harkee
master
stefano
take
heed
of
thy
prisoner
for
the
senate
makes
great
account
of
her
security
the
calabrian
made
such
a
gesture
as
one
initiated
uses
when
he
would
express
a
confidence
in
his
own
shrewdness
while
the
pretended
roderigo
his
gondola
stefano
began
to
awaken
his
people
as
the
gondola
entered
the
canal
of
san
marco
the
sails
of
the
felucca
fell
and
the
low
calabrian
vessel
stole
along
the
tiers
towards
the
clear
water
beyond
the
boat
quickly
touched
the
steps
of
the
of
the
palace
gelsomina
entered
the
arch
and
glided
up
the
giant
stairway
the
route
by
which
she
had
quitted
the
palace
the
halberdier
was
the
same
that
watched
as
she
went
out
he
spoke
to
her
in
gallantry
but
offered
no
impediment
to
her
entrance
haste
noble
ladies
hasten
for
the
love
of
the
holy
virgin
exclaimed
gelsomina
as
she
burst
into
the
room
in
which
donna
violetta
and
her
companion
awaited
her
appearance
i
have
endangered
your
liberty
by
my
weakness
and
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
follow
while
you
may
nor
stop
to
whisper
even
a
prayer
thou
art
hurried
and
breathless
returned
donna
florinda
hast
thou
seen
the
duca
di
sant
agata
nay
question
me
not
but
follow
noble
dames
gelsomina
seized
the
lamp
and
casting
a
glance
that
appealed
strongly
to
her
visitors
for
tacit
compliance
she
led
the
way
into
the
corridors
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
she
was
followed
the
prison
was
left
in
safety
the
bridge
of
sighs
was
passed
for
it
will
be
remembered
that
gelsomina
was
still
mistress
of
the
keys
and
the
party
went
swiftly
by
the
great
stairs
of
the
palace
into
the
open
gallery
no
obstruction
was
offered
to
their
progress
and
they
all
descended
to
the
court
with
the
quiet
demeanor
of
females
who
went
out
on
their
ordinary
affairs
jacopo
awaited
at
the
in
less
than
a
minute
he
was
driving
his
gondola
across
the
port
following
the
course
of
the
felucca
whose
white
sail
was
visible
in
the
moonlight
now
bellying
in
the
breeze
and
now
flapping
as
the
mariners
checked
her
speed
gelsomina
watched
their
progress
for
a
moment
in
breathless
interest
and
then
she
crossed
the
bridge
of
the
quay
and
entered
the
prison
by
its
public
gate
hast
thou
made
sure
of
the
old
daughter
demanded
jacopo
on
reaching
the
deck
of
the
bella
sorrentina
again
she
is
like
shifting
ballast
master
roderigo
first
on
one
side
of
the
cabin
and
then
on
the
other
but
you
see
the
bolt
is
undrawn
is
well
here
is
more
of
thy
freight
thou
hast
the
proper
passes
for
the
galley
of
the
guard
all
is
in
excellent
order
signore
when
was
stefano
milano
out
of
rule
in
a
matter
of
haste
diamine
let
the
breeze
come
and
though
the
senate
should
wish
us
back
again
it
might
send
all
its
sbirri
after
us
in
vain
excellent
stefano
fill
thy
sails
then
for
our
masters
watch
your
movements
and
set
a
value
on
your
diligence
while
the
calabrian
complied
jacopo
assisted
the
females
to
come
up
out
of
the
gondola
in
a
moment
the
heavy
yards
swung
off
wing
and
wing
and
the
bubbles
that
appeared
to
glance
past
the
side
of
the
bella
sorrentina
denoted
her
speed
thou
hast
noble
ladies
in
thy
passengers
said
jacopo
to
the
padrone
when
the
latter
was
released
from
the
active
duties
of
getting
his
vessel
in
motion
and
though
policy
requires
that
they
should
quit
the
city
for
a
time
thou
wilt
gain
favor
by
consulting
their
pleasures
doubt
me
not
master
roderigo
but
thou
forgettest
that
i
have
not
yet
received
my
sailing
instructions
a
felucca
without
a
course
is
as
badly
off
as
an
owl
in
the
sun
that
in
good
time
there
will
come
an
officer
of
the
republic
to
settle
this
matter
with
thee
i
would
not
have
these
noble
ladies
know
that
one
like
annina
is
to
be
their
while
they
are
near
the
port
for
they
might
complain
of
disrespect
thou
understandest
stefano
cospetto
am
i
a
fool
a
blunderer
if
so
why
does
the
senate
employ
me
the
girl
is
out
of
hearing
and
there
let
her
stay
as
long
as
the
noble
dames
are
willing
to
breathe
the
night
air
they
shall
have
none
of
her
company
no
fear
of
them
the
dwellers
of
the
land
little
relish
the
pent
air
of
thy
cabin
thou
wilt
go
without
the
lido
stefano
and
await
my
coming
if
thou
not
see
me
before
the
hour
of
one
bear
away
for
the
port
of
ancona
where
thou
wilt
get
further
tidings
stefano
who
had
often
previously
received
his
instructions
from
the
imaginary
roderigo
nodded
assent
and
they
parted
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
that
the
fugitives
had
been
fully
instructed
in
the
conduct
they
were
to
maintain
the
gondola
of
jacopo
never
flew
faster
than
he
now
urged
it
towards
the
land
in
the
constant
passage
of
the
boats
the
movements
of
one
were
not
likely
to
be
remarked
and
he
found
when
he
reached
the
quay
of
the
square
that
his
passing
and
repassing
had
not
been
observed
he
boldly
unmasked
and
landed
it
was
near
the
hour
when
he
had
given
don
camillo
a
rendezvous
in
the
piazza
and
he
walked
slowly
up
the
smaller
square
towards
the
appointed
place
of
meeting
jacopo
as
has
been
seen
in
an
earlier
chapter
had
a
practice
of
walking
near
the
columns
of
granite
in
the
first
hours
of
the
night
it
was
the
vulgar
impression
that
he
waited
there
for
custom
in
his
bloody
calling
as
men
of
more
innocent
lives
take
their
stands
in
places
of
mark
when
seen
on
his
customary
stand
he
was
avoided
by
all
who
were
chary
of
their
character
or
scrupulous
of
appearances
the
persecuted
and
yet
singularly
tolerated
bravo
was
slowly
pacing
the
flags
on
his
way
to
the
appointed
place
unwilling
to
anticipate
the
moment
when
a
laquais
thrust
a
paper
into
his
hand
and
disappeared
as
fast
as
legs
would
carry
him
it
has
been
seen
that
jacopo
could
not
read
for
that
was
an
age
when
men
of
his
class
were
studiously
kept
in
ignorance
he
turned
to
the
first
passenger
who
had
the
appearance
of
being
likely
to
satisfy
his
wishes
and
desired
him
to
do
the
office
of
interpreter
he
had
addressed
an
honest
of
a
distant
quarter
the
man
took
the
scroll
and
commenced
reading
its
contents
aloud
i
am
called
away
and
can
not
meet
thee
jacopo
at
the
name
of
jacopo
the
tradesman
dropped
the
paper
and
fled
the
bravo
walked
slowly
back
again
towards
the
quay
ruminating
on
the
awkward
accident
which
had
crossed
his
plans
his
elbow
was
touched
and
a
masker
confronted
him
when
he
turned
thou
art
jacopo
frontoni
said
the
stranger
none
else
thou
hast
a
hand
to
serve
an
employer
faithfully
i
keep
my
faith
is
well
thou
wilt
find
a
hundred
sequins
in
this
sack
whose
life
is
set
against
this
gold
asked
jacopo
in
an
under
tone
don
camillo
monforte
don
camillo
monforte
the
same
dost
thou
know
the
rich
noble
you
have
well
described
him
signore
he
would
pay
his
barber
this
for
letting
blood
do
thy
job
thoroughly
and
the
price
shall
be
doubled
i
want
the
security
of
a
name
i
know
you
not
signore
the
stranger
looked
cautiously
around
him
and
raising
his
mask
for
an
instant
he
showed
the
countenance
of
giacomo
gradenigo
is
the
pledge
sufficient
signore
it
is
when
must
this
deed
be
done
this
night
nay
this
hour
even
shall
i
strike
a
noble
of
his
rank
in
his
palace
in
his
very
pleasures
come
hither
jacopo
and
thou
shalt
know
more
hast
thou
a
mask
the
bravo
signified
his
assent
then
keep
thy
face
behind
a
cloud
for
it
is
not
in
favor
here
and
seek
thy
boat
i
will
join
thee
the
young
patrician
whose
form
was
effectually
concealed
by
his
attire
quitted
his
companion
with
a
view
of
rejoining
him
anew
where
his
person
should
not
be
known
jacopo
forced
his
boat
from
among
the
crowd
at
the
quay
and
having
entered
the
open
space
between
the
tiers
he
lay
on
his
oar
well
knowing
that
he
was
watched
and
that
he
would
soon
be
followed
his
conjecture
was
right
for
in
a
few
moments
a
gondola
pulled
swiftly
to
the
side
of
his
own
and
two
men
in
masks
passed
from
the
strange
boat
into
that
of
the
bravo
without
speaking
to
the
lido
said
a
voice
which
jacopo
knew
to
be
that
of
his
new
employer
he
was
obeyed
the
boat
of
giacomo
gradenigo
following
at
a
little
distance
when
they
were
without
the
tiers
and
consequently
beyond
the
danger
of
being
overheard
the
two
passengers
came
out
of
the
pavilion
and
made
a
sign
to
the
bravo
to
cease
rowing
thou
wilt
accept

it

have
found

from

he
is
now
in
thy

with
no
other
hope
than
that
which
may
come

giacomo
you
have
no
respect
for
reputations
and
surety
i
see
no
necessity
for
a

master
jacopo
but
a
smart
wound
that
may
put
matrimony
out
of
the
head
of
the
duca
for
a
time
at

and
penitence
into

the

preferred

secondary
expedients

hosea
our
affair
is
ended
giacomo
gradenigo
made
a
sign
for
his
gondola
to
approach
and
dropping
a
sack
which
contained
the
retainer
in
this
bloody
business
he
passed
into
it
with
the
indifference
of
one
who
had
been
accustomed
to
consider
such
means
of
attaining
his
object
lawful
not
so
hosea
he
was
a
rogue
rather
than
a
villain
the
preservation
of
his
money
with
the
temptation
of
a
large
sum
which
had
been
promised
him
by
both
father
and
son
in
the
event
of
the
latter
success
with
violetta
were
irresistible
temptations
to
one
who
had
lived
contemned
by
those
around
him
and
he
found
his
solace
for
the
ruthless
attempt
in
the
acquisition
of
those
means
of
enjoyment
which
are
sought
equally
by
christian
and
jew
still
his
blood
curdled
at
the
extremity
to
which
giacomo
would
push
the
affair
and
he
lingered
to
utter
a
parting
word
to
the
bravo
thou
art
said
to
carry
a
sure
stiletto
honest
jacopo
he
whispered
a
hand
of
thy
practice
must
know
how
to
maim
as
well
as
to
slay
strike
the
neapolitan
smartly
but
spare
his
life
even
the
bearer
of
a
public
dagger
like
thine
may
not
fare
the
worse
at
the
coming
of
shiloh
for
having
been
tender
of
his
strength
on
occasion
thou
forgettest
the
gold
hosea
father
abraham
what
a
memory
am
i
getting
in
my
years
thou
sayest
truth
mindful
jacopo
the
gold
shall
be
forthcoming
in
any
event
always
provided
that
the
affair
is
so
managed
as
to
leave
my
young
friend
a
successful
adventurer
with
the
heiress
jacopo
made
an
impatient
gesture
for
at
that
moment
he
saw
a
gondolier
pulling
rapidly
towards
a
private
part
of
the
lido
the
hebrew
joined
his
companion
and
the
boat
of
the
bravo
darted
ahead
it
was
not
long
ere
it
lay
on
the
strand
of
the
lido
the
steps
of
jacopo
were
rapid
as
he
moved
towards
those
proscribed
graves
among
which
he
had
made
his
confession
to
the
very
man
he
was
now
sent
to
slay
art
thou
sent
to
meet
me
demanded
one
who
started
from
behind
a
rising
in
the
sands
but
who
took
the
precaution
to
bare
his
rapier
as
he
appeared
signor
duca
i
am
returned
the
bravo
unmasking
jacopo
this
is
even
better
than
i
had
hoped
hast
thou
tidings
from
my
bride
follow
don
camillo
and
you
shall
quickly
meet
her
words
were
unnecessary
to
persuade
when
there
was
such
a
promise
they
were
both
in
the
gondola
of
jacopo
and
on
their
way
to
one
of
the
passages
through
the
lido
which
conducts
to
the
gulf
before
the
bravo
commenced
his
explanation
this
however
was
quickly
made
not
forgetting
the
design
of
giacomo
gradenigo
on
the
life
of
his
auditor
the
felucca
which
had
been
previously
provided
with
the
necessary
pass
by
the
agents
of
the
police
itself
had
quitted
the
port
under
easy
sail
by
the
very
inlet
through
which
the
gondola
made
its
way
into
the
adriatic
the
water
was
smooth
the
breeze
fresh
from
the
land
and
in
short
all
things
were
favorable
to
the
fugitives
donna
violetta
and
her
governess
were
leaning
against
a
mast
watching
with
impatient
eyes
the
distant
domes
and
the
midnight
beauty
of
venice
occasionally
strains
of
music
came
to
their
ears
from
the
canals
and
then
a
touch
of
natural
melancholy
crossed
the
feelings
of
the
former
as
she
feared
they
might
be
the
last
sounds
of
that
nature
she
should
ever
hear
from
her
native
town
but
unalloyed
pleasure
drove
every
regret
from
her
mind
when
don
camillo
leaped
from
the
gondola
and
folded
her
in
triumph
to
his
heart
there
was
little
difficulty
in
persuading
stefano
milano
to
abandon
for
ever
the
service
of
the
senate
for
that
of
his
feudal
lord
the
promises
and
commands
of
the
latter
were
sufficient
of
themselves
to
reconcile
him
to
the
change
and
all
were
convinced
there
was
no
time
to
lose
the
felucca
soon
spread
her
canvas
to
the
wind
and
slid
away
from
the
beach
jacopo
permitted
his
gondola
to
be
towed
a
league
to
sea
before
he
prepared
to
it
you
will
steer
for
ancona
signor
don
camillo
said
the
bravo
leaning
on
the
felucca
side
still
unwilling
to
depart
and
throw
yourself
at
once
under
the
protection
of
the
cardinal
secretary
if
stefano
keep
the
sea
he
may
chance
to
meet
the
galleys
of

distrust
us
not
but
thou
my
excellent
jacopo
what
wilt
thou
become
in
their
hands
fear
not
for
me
signore
god
disposes
of
all
as
he
sees
fit
i
have
told
your
eccellenza
that
i
can
not
yet
quit

if
fortune
favor
me
i
may
still
see
your
stout
castle
of
sant
agata
and
none
will
be
more
welcome
within
its
secure
walls
i
have
much
fear
for
thee
jacopo
signore
think
not
of
it
i
am
used
to
danger
and
to
misery
and
to
hopelessness
i
have
known
a
pleasure
this
night
in
witnessing
the
happiness
of
two
young
hearts
that
god
in
his
anger
has
long
denied
me
lady
the
saints
keep
you
and
god
who
is
above
all
shield
you
from
harm
he
kissed
the
hand
of
donna
violetta
who
half
ignorant
still
of
his
services
listened
to
his
words
in
wonder
don
camillo
monforte
he
continued
distrust
venice
to
your
dying
day
let
no
promises
no
hopes
no
desire
of
increasing
your
honors
or
your
riches
ever
tempt
you
to
put
yourself
in
her
power
none
know
the
falsehood
of
the
state
better
than
i
and
with
my
parting
words
i
warn
you
to
be
wary
thou
speakest
as
if
we
were
to
meet
no
more
worthy
jacopo
the
bravo
turned
and
the
action
brought
his
features
to
the
moon
there
was
a
melancholy
smile
in
which
deep
satisfaction
at
the
success
of
the
lovers
was
mingled
with
serious
forebodings
for
himself
we
are
certain
only
of
the
past
he
said
in
a
low
voice
touching
the
hand
of
don
camillo
he
kissed
his
own
and
leaped
hastily
into
his
gondola
the
fast
was
thrown
loose
and
the
felucca
glided
away
leaving
this
extraordinary
being
alone
on
the
waters
the
neapolitan
ran
to
the
taffrail
and
the
last
he
saw
of
jacopo
the
bravo
was
rowing
leisurely
back
towards
that
scene
of
violence
and
deception
from
which
he
himself
was
so
glad
to
have
escaped

the

dawned
on
the

morning
the
square

was
empty
the
priests
still
chanted
their
prayers
for
the
dead
near
the
body
of

and
a
few
fishermen
still
lingered
in
and
near
the
cathedral
but
half
persuaded
of
the
manner
in
which
their
companion
had
come
to
his
end
but
as
was
usual
at
that
hour
of
the
day
the
city
appeared
tranquil
for
though
a
slight
alarm
had
passed
through
the
canals
at
the
movement
of
the
rioters
it
had
subsided
in
that
specious
and
distrustful
quiet
which
is
more
or
less
the
unavoidable
consequence
of
a
system
that
is
not
substantially
based
on
the
willing
support
of

jacopo
was
again
in
the
attic
of
the
doge
palace
accompanied
by
the
gentle
gelsomina
as
they
threaded
the
windings
of
the
building
he
recounted
to
the
eager
ear
of
his
companion
all
the
details
connected
with
the
escape
of
the
lovers
omitting
as
a
matter
of
prudence
the
attempt
of
giacomo
gradenigo
on
the
life
of
don
camillo
the
unpractised
and
girl
heard
him
in
breathless
attention
the
color
of
her
cheek
and
the
changeful
eye
betraying
the
force
of
her
sympathies
at
each
turn
in
their
hazardous
adventure
and
dost
thou
think
they
can
yet
escape
from
those
up
above

gelsomina
for
few
in

would
trust
their
voices
by
putting
such
a
question
aloud
thou
knowest

hath
at

its

in

we
have

there
a
place
here
whence
we
can
look
out
upon
the
sea
gelsomina
led
the
bravo
into
an
empty
room
of
the
attic
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
port
the
lido
and
the
waste
of
water
beyond
the
breeze
came
in
strong
currents
over
the
roofs
of
the
town
and
causing
the
masts
of
the
port
to
rock
it
lighted
on
the
lagunes
without
the
tiers
of
the
shipping
from
this
point
to
the
barrier
of
sand
it
was
apparent
by
the
stooping
sails
and
the
struggles
of
the
gondoliers
who
pulled
towards
the
quay
that
the
air
was
swift
without
the
lido
itself
the
element
was
shadowed
and
fitful
while
further
in
the
distance
the
troubled
waters
with
their
crests
of
foam
sufficiently
proved
its
power
santa
maria
be
praised
exclaimed
jacopo
when
his
understanding
eye
had
run
over
the
near
and
distant
view
they
are
already
far
down
the
coast
and
with
a
wind
like
this
they
can
not
fail
to
reach
their
haven
in
a
few
hours
let
us
go
to
the
cell
gelsomina
smiled
when
he
assured
her
of
the
safety
of
the
fugitives
but
her
look
saddened
when
he
changed
the
discourse
without
reply
however
she
did
as
he
desired
and
in
a
very
few
moments
they
were
standing
by
the
side
of
the
prisoner
pallet
the
latter
did
not
appear
to
observe
their
entrance
and
jacopo
was
obliged
to
announce
himself
father
he
said
with
that
melancholy
pathos
which
always
crept
into
his
voice
when
he
addressed
the
old
man
it
is
i
the
prisoner
turned
and
though
evidently
much
enfeebled
since
the
last
visit
a
wan
smile
gleamed
on
his
wasted
features
and
thy
mother
boy
he
asked
so
eagerly
as
to
cause
gelsomina
to
turn
hastily
aside
happy
father
happy
happy
without
me
she
is
ever
with
thee
in
spirit
father
she
thinks
of
thee
in
her
prayers
thou
hast
a
saint
for
an
intercessor
in
my
mother
father
and
thy
good
sister
happy
too
doubt
it
not
father
they
are
both
patient
and
resigned
the
senate
boy
is
the
same
soulless
selfish
and
pretending
answered
jacopo
sternly
then
turning
away
his
face
in
bitterness
of
heart
though
without
permitting
the
words
to
be
audible
he
cursed
them
the
noble
signori
were
deceived
in
believing
me
concerned
in
the
attempt
to
rob
their
revenues
returned
the
patient
old
man
one
day
they
will
see
and
acknowledge
their
error
jacopo
made
no
answer
for
unlettered
as
he
was
and
curtailed
of
that
knowledge
which
should
be
and
is
bestowed
on
all
by
every
paternal
government
the
natural
strength
of
his
mind
had
enabled
him
to
understand
that
a
system
which
on
its
face
professed
to
be
founded
on
the
superior
acquirements
of
a
privileged
few
would
be
the
least
likely
to
admit
the
fallacy
of
its
theories
by
confessing
it
could
err
thou
dost
the
nobles
injustice
son
they
are
illustrious
patricians
and
have
no
motive
in
oppressing
one
like
me
none
father
but
the
necessity
of
maintaining
the
severity
of
the
laws
which
make
them
senators
and
you
a
prisoner
nay
boy
i
have
known
worthy
gentlemen
of
the
senate
there
was
the
late
signor
tiepolo
who
did
me
much
favor
in
my
youth
but
for
this
false
accusation
i
might
now
have
been
one
of
the
most
thriving
of
my
craft
in
venice
father
we
will
pray
for
the
soul
of
the
tiepolo
is
the
senator
dead
so
says
a
gorgeous
tomb
in
the
church
of
the
redentore
we
must
all
die
at
last
whispered
the
old
man
crossing
himself
doge
as
well
as
patrician
patrician
as
well
as
gondolier
jaco
father
exclaimed
the
bravo
so
suddenly
as
to
interrupt
the
coming
word
then
kneeling
by
the
pallet
of
the
prisoner
he
whispered
in
his
ear
thou
forgettest
there
is
reason
why
thou
not
call
me
by
that
name
i
have
told
thee
often
if
thus
called
my
visits
must
stop
the
prisoner
looked
bewildered
for
the
failing
of
nature
rendered
that
obscure
which
was
once
so
evident
to
his
mind
after
gazing
long
at
his
son
his
eye
wandered
between
him
and
the
wall
and
he
smiled
childishly
wilt
thou
look
good
boy
if
the
spider
is
come
back
jacopo
groaned
but
he
rose
to
comply
i
do
not
see
it
father
the
season
is
not
yet
warm
not
warm
my
veins
feel
heated
to
bursting
thou
forgettest
this
is
the
attic
and
that
these
are
the
leads
and
then
the
sun
oh
the
sun
the
illustrious
senators
do
not
bethink
them
of
the
pain
of
passing
the
bleak
winter
below
the
canals
and
the
burning
summers
beneath
hot
metal
they
think
of
nothing
but
their
power
murmured
jacopo
that
which
is
wrongfully
obtained
must
be
maintained
by
merciless
injustice
but
why
should
we
speak
of
this
father
hast
thou
all
thy
body
needs
air
son
air
give
me
of
that
air
which
god
has
made
for
the
meanest
living
thing
the
bravo
rushed
towards
those
fissures
in
the
venerable
but
polluted
pile
he
had
already
striven
to
open
and
with
frantic
force
he
endeavored
to
widen
them
with
his
hands
the
material
resisted
though
blood
flowed
from
the
ends
of
his
fingers
in
the
desperate
effort
the
door
gelsomina
open
wide
the
door
he
cried
turning
away
from
the
spot
exhausted
with
his
fruitless
exertions
nay
i
do
not
suffer
now
my
child
it
is
when
thou
hast
left
me
and
when
i
am
alone
with
my
own
thoughts
when
i
see
thy
weeping
mother
and
neglected
sister
that
i
most
feel
the
want
of
air
are
we
not
in
the
fervid
month
of
august
son
father
it
is
not
yet
june
i
shall
then
have
more
heat
to
bear
god
will
be
done
and
blessed
santa
maria
his
mother
undefiled
give
me
strength
to
endure
it
the
eye
of
jacopo
gleamed
with
a
wildness
scarcely
less
frightful
than
the
ghastly
look
of
the
old
man
his
chest
heaved
his
fingers
were
clenched
and
his
breathing
was
audible
no
he
said
in
a
low
but
in
so
determined
a
voice
as
to
prove
how
fiercely
his
resolution
was
set
thou
shalt
not
await
their
torments
arise
father
and
go
with
me
the
doors
are
open
the
ways
of
the
palace
are
known
to
me
in
the
darkest
night
and
the
keys
are
at
hand
i
will
find
means
to
conceal
thee
until
dark
and
we
will
quit
the
accursed
republic
for
ever
hope
gleamed
in
the
eye
of
the
old
captive
as
he
listened
to
this
frantic
proposal
but
distrust
of
the
means
immediately
altered
its
expression
thou
forgettest
those
up
above
son
i
think
only
of
one
truly
above
father
and
this
girl
how
canst
thou
hope
to
deceive
her
she
will
take
thy
place
she
is
with
us
in
heart
and
will
lend
herself
to
a
seeming
violence
i
do
not
promise
for
thee
idly
kindest
gelsomina
the
frightened
girl
who
had
never
before
witnessed
so
plain
evidence
of
desperation
in
her
companion
had
sunk
upon
an
article
of
furniture
speechless
the
look
of
the
prisoner
changed
from
one
to
the
other
and
he
made
an
effort
to
rise
but
debility
caused
him
to
fall
backwards
and
not
till
then
did
jacopo
perceive
the
impracticability
on
many
accounts
of
what
in
a
moment
of
excitement
he
had
proposed
a
long
silence
followed
the
hard
breathing
of
jacopo
gradually
subsided
and
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
to
its
customary
settled
and
collected
look
father
he
said
i
must
quit
thee
our
misery
draws
near
a
close
thou
wilt
come
to
me
soon
again
if
the
saints
permit
thy
blessing
father
the
old
man
folded
his
hands
above
the
head
of
jacopo
and
murmured
a
prayer
when
this
pious
duty
was
performed
both
the
bravo
and
gelsomina
busied
themselves
a
little
time
in
contributing
to
the
bodily
comforts
of
the
prisoner
and
then
they
departed
in
company
jacopo
appeared
unwilling
to
quit
the
vicinity
of
the
cell
a
melancholy
presentiment
seemed
to
possess
his
mind
that
these
stolen
visits
were
soon
to
cease
after
a
little
delay
however
they
descended
to
the
apartments
below
and
as
jacopo
desired
to
quit
the
palace
without
the
prisons
gelsomina
prepared
to
let
him
out
by
the
principal
corridor
thou
art
sadder
than
common
carlo
she
observed
watching
with
feminine
assiduity
his
averted
eye
methinks
thou
rejoice
in
the
fortunes
of
the
neapolitan
and
of
the
lady
of
the
tiepolo
that
escape
is
like
a
gleam
of
sunshine
in
a
wintry
day
good
girl
but
we
are
observed
who
is
yon
spy
on
our
movements
is
a
menial
of
the
palace
they
constantly
cross
us
in
this
part
of
the
building
come
hither
if
thou
art
weary
the
room
is
little
used
and
we
may
again
look
out
upon
the
sea
jacopo
followed
his
mild
conductor
into
one
of
the
neglected
closets
of
the
second
floor
where
in
truth
he
was
glad
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
state
of
things
in
the
piazza
before
he
left
the
palace
his
first
look
was
at
the
water
which
was
still
rolling
southward
before
the
gale
from
the
alps
satisfied
with
this
prospect
he
bent
his
eye
beneath
at
the
instant
an
officer
of
the
republic
issued
from
the
palace
gate
preceded
by
a
trumpeter
as
was
usual
when
there
was
occasion
to
make
public
proclamation
of
the
senate
will
gelsomina
opened
the
casement
and
both
leaned
forward
to
listen
when
the
little
procession
had
reached
the
front
of
the
cathedral
the
trumpet
sounded
and
the
voice
of
the
officer
was
heard
whereas
many
wicked
and
ruthless
assassinations
have
of
late
been
committed
on
the
persons
of
divers
good
citizens
of
venice
he
proclaimed
the
senate
in
its
fatherly
care
of
all
whom
it
is
charged
to
protect
has
found
reason
to
resort
to
extraordinary
means
of
preventing
the
repetition
of
crimes
so
contrary
to
the
laws
of
god
and
the
security
of
society
the
illustrious
ten
therefore
offer
thus
publicly
a
reward
of
one
hundred
sequins
to
him
who
shall
discover
the
perpetrator
of
any
of
these
most
horrible
assassinations
and
whereas
during
the
past
night
the
body
of
a
certain
antonio
a
well
known
fisherman
and
a
worthy
citizen
much
esteemed
by
the
patricians
has
been
found
in
the
lagunes
and
whereas
there
is
but
too
much
reason
to
believe
that
he
has
come
to
his
death
by
the
hands
of
a
certain
jacopo
frontoni
who
has
the
reputation
of
a
common
bravo
but
who
has
been
long
watched
in
rain
by
the
authorities
with
the
hope
of
detecting
him
in
the
commission
of
some
one
of
the
aforesaid
horrible
assassinations
now
all
good
and
honest
citizens
of
the
republic
are
enjoined
to
assist
the
authorities
in
seizing
the
person
of
the
said
jacopo
frontoni
even
though
he
should
take
sanctuary
for
venice
can
no
longer
endure
the
presence
of
one
of
his
sanguinary
habits
and
for
the
encouragement
of
the
same
the
senate
in
its
paternal
care
offers
the
reward
of
three
hundred
sequins
the
usual
words
of
prayer
and
sovereignty
closed
the
proclamation
as
it
was
not
usual
for
those
who
ruled
so
much
in
the
dark
to
make
their
intentions
public
all
near
listened
with
wonder
and
awe
to
the
novel
procedure
some
trembled
lest
the
mysterious
and
power
was
about
to
exhibit
itself
while
most
found
means
of
making
their
admiration
of
the
fatherly
interest
of
their
rulers
audible
none
heard
the
words
of
the
officer
with
more
feeling
than
gelsomina
she
bent
her
body
far
from
the
window
in
order
that
not
a
syllable
should
escape
her
thou
hear
carlo
demanded
the
eager
girl
as
she
drew
back
her
head
they
proclaim
at
last
money
for
the
monster
who
has
committed
so
many
murders
jacopo
laughed
but
to
the
ears
of
his
startled
companion
the
sounds
were
unnatural
the
patricians
are
just
and
what
they
do
is
right
he
said
they
are
of
illustrious
birth
and
can
not
err
they
will
do
their
duty
but
here
is
no
other
duty
than
that
they
owe
to
god
and
to
the
people
i
have
heard
of
the
duty
of
the
people
but
little
is
said
of
the
senate
nay
carlo
we
will
not
refuse
them
credit
when
in
truth
they
seek
to
keep
the
citizens
from
harm
this
jacopo
is
a
monster
detested
by
all
and
his
bloody
deeds
have
too
long
been
a
reproach
to
venice
thou
hearest
that
the
patricians
are
not
niggard
of
their
gold
when
there
is
hope
of
his
being
taken
listen
they
proclaim
again
the
trumpet
sounded
and
the
proclamation
was
repeated
between
the
granite
columns
of
the
piazzetta
and
quite
near
to
the
window
occupied
by
gelsomina
and
her
unmoved
companion
why
dost
thou
mask
carlo
she
asked
when
the
officer
had
done
it
is
not
usual
to
be
disguised
in
the
palace
at
this
hour
they
will
believe
it
the
doge
blushing
to
be
an
auditor
of
his
own
liberal
justice
or
they
may
mistake
me
for
one
of
the
three
itself
they
go
by
the
quay
to
the
arsenal
thence
they
will
take
boat
as
is
customary
for
the
rialto
thereby
giving
this
redoubtable
jacopo
timely
notice
to
secrete
himself
your
judges
up
above
are
mysterious
when
they
should
be
open
and
open
when
they
should
be
secret
i
must
quit
thee
gelsomina
go
then
back
to
the
room
of
thy
father
and
leave
me
to
pass
out
by
the
court
of
the
palace
it
may
not
be
carlo
thou
knowest
the
permission
of
the
authorities
i
have
exceeded
why
should
i
wish
to
conceal
it
from
thee
but
it
was
not
permitted
to
thee
to
enter
at
this
hour
and
thou
hast
had
the
courage
to
transgress
the
leave
for
my
sake
gelsomina
the
abashed
girl
hung
her
head
and
the
color
which
glowed
about
her
temples
was
like
the
rosy
light
of
her
own
italy
thou
have
it
so
she
said
a
thousand
thanks
dearest
kindest
truest
gelsomina
but
doubt
not
my
being
able
to
leave
the
palace
unseen
the
danger
was
in
entering
they
who
go
forth
do
it
with
the
air
of
having
authority
none
pass
the
halberdiers
masked
by
day
carlo
but
they
who
have
the
secret
word
the
bravo
appeared
struck
with
this
truth
and
there
was
great
embarrassment
expressed
in
his
manner
the
terms
of
his
admittance
were
so
well
understood
to
himself
that
he
distrusted
the
expediency
of
attempting
to
get
upon
the
quays
by
the
prison
the
way
he
had
entered
since
he
had
little
doubt
that
his
retreat
would
be
intercepted
by
those
who
kept
the
outer
gate
and
who
were
probably
by
this
time
in
the
secret
of
his
true
character
it
now
appeared
that
egress
by
the
other
route
was
equally
hazardous
he
had
not
been
surprised
so
much
by
the
substance
of
the
proclamation
as
by
the
publicity
the
senate
had
seen
fit
to
give
to
its
policy
and
he
had
heard
himself
denounced
with
a
severe
pang
it
is
true
but
without
terror
still
he
had
so
many
means
of
disguise
and
the
practice
of
personal
concealment
was
so
general
in
venice
that
he
had
entertained
no
great
distrust
of
the
result
until
he
now
found
himself
in
this
awkward
dilemma
gelsomina
read
his
indecision
in
his
eye
and
regretted
that
she
should
have
caused
him
so
much
uneasiness
it
is
not
so
bad
as
thou
seemest
to
think
carlo
she
observed
they
have
permitted
thee
to
visit
thy
father
at
stated
hours
and
the
permission
is
a
proof
that
the
senate
is
not
without
pity
now
that
i
to
oblige
thy
wishes
have
forgotten
one
of
their
injunctions
they
will
not
be
so
hard
of
heart
as
to
visit
the
fault
as
a
crime
jacopo
gazed
at
her
with
pity
for
well
did
he
understand
how
little
she
knew
of
the
real
nature
and
wily
policy
of
the
state
it
is
time
that
we
should
part
he
said
lest
thy
innocence
should
be
made
to
pay
the
price
of
my
mistake
i
am
now
near
the
public
corridor
and
must
trust
to
my
fortune
to
gain
the
quay
gelsomina
hung
upon
his
arm
unwilling
to
trust
him
to
his
own
guidance
in
that
fearful
building
it
will
not
do
carlo
thou
wilt
stumble
on
a
soldier
and
thy
fault
will
be
known
perhaps
they
will
refuse
to
let
thee
come
again
perhaps
altogether
shut
the
door
of
thy
poor
father
cell
jacopo
made
a
gesture
for
her
to
lead
the
way
and
followed
with
a
beating
but
still
lightened
heart
gelsomina
glided
along
the
passages
carefully
locking
each
door
as
of
wont
behind
her
when
she
had
passed
through
it
at
length
they
reached
the
well
known
bridge
of
sighs
the
anxious
girl
went
on
with
a
lighter
step
when
she
found
herself
approaching
her
own
abode
for
she
was
busy
in
planning
the
means
of
concealing
her
companion
in
her
father
rooms
should
there
be
hazard
in
his
passing
out
of
the
prison
during
the
day
but
a
single
minute
carlo
she
whispered
applying
the
key
to
the
door
which
opened
into
the
latter
building
the
lock
yielded
but
the
hinges
refused
to
turn
gelsomina
paled
as
she
added
they
have
drawn
the
bolts
within
no
matter
i
will
go
down
by
the
court
of
the
palace
and
boldly
pass
the
halberdier
unmasked
gelsomina
after
all
saw
but
little
risk
of
his
being
known
by
the
mercenaries
who
served
the
doge
and
anxious
to
relieve
him
from
so
awkward
a
position
she
flew
back
to
the
other
end
of
the
gallery
another
key
was
applied
to
the
door
by
which
they
had
just
entered
with
the
same
result
gelsomina
staggered
back
and
sought
support
against
the
waft
we
can
neither
return
nor
proceed
she
exclaimed
frightened
she
knew
not
why
i
see
it
all
answered
jacopo
we
are
prisoners
on
the
fatal
bridge
as
he
spoke
the
bravo
calmly
removed
his
mask
and
showed
the
countenance
of
a
man
whose
resolution
was
at
its
height
santa
madre
di
dio
what
can
it
mean
that
we
have
passed
here
once
too
often
love
the
council
is
tender
of
these
visits
the
bolts
of
both
doors
grated
and
the
hinges
creaked
at
the
same
instant
an
officer
of
the
inquisition
entered
armed
and
bearing
manacles
gelsomina
shrieked
but
jacopo
moved
not
limb
or
muscle
while
he
was
fettered
and
chained
i
too
cried
his
frantic
companion
i
am
the
most
guilty
bind
me
cast
me
into
a
cell
but
let
poor
carlo
go
carlo
echoed
an
officer
laughing
unfeelingly
is
it
such
a
crime
to
seek
a
father
in
his
prison
they
knew
of
his
visits
they
permitted
them
he
has
only
mistaken
the
hour
girl
dost
thou
know
for
whom
thou
pleadest
for
the
kindest
heart
the
most
faithful
son
in
venice
oh
if
ye
had
seen
him
weep
as
i
have
done
over
the
sufferings
of
the
old
captive
if
ye
had
seen
his
very
form
shivering
in
agony
ye
would
have
pity
on
him
listen
returned
the
officer
raising
a
finger
for
attention
the
trumpeter
sounded
on
the
bridge
of
mark
immediately
beneath
them
and
proclamation
was
again
made
offering
gold
for
the
arrest
of
the
bravo
is
the
officer
of
the
republic
bidding
for
the
head
of
one
who
carries
a
common
stiletto
cried
the
gelsomina
who
little
heeded
the
ceremony
at
that
instant
he
merits
his
fate
then
why
resist
it
ye
speak
without
meaning
doting
girl
this
is
jacopo
frontoni
gelsomina
would
have
disbelieved
her
ears
but
for
the
anguished
expression
of
jacopo
eye
the
horrible
truth
burst
upon
her
mind
and
she
fell
lifeless
at
that
moment
the
bravo
was
hurried
from
the
bridge
chapter
xxvii
let
us
lift
up
the
curtain
and
observe
what
passes
in
that
chamber
rogers
there
were
many
rumors
uttered
in
the
fearful
and
secret
manner
which
characterized
the
manner
of
the
town
in
the
streets
of
venice
that
day
hundreds
passed
near
the
granite
columns
as
if
they
expected
to
see
the
bravo
occupying
his
accustomed
stand
in
audacious
defiance
of
the
proclamation
for
so
long
and
so
mysteriously
had
he
been
permitted
to
appear
in
public
that
men
had
difficulty
in
persuading
themselves
he
would
quit
his
habits
so
easily
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
vague
expectation
was
disappointed
much
was
also
said
vauntingly
in
behalf
of
the
republic
justice
for
the
humbled
are
bold
enough
in
praising
their
superiors
and
he
who
had
been
dumb
for
years
on
subjects
of
a
public
nature
now
found
his
voice
like
a
fearless
freeman
but
the
day
passed
away
without
any
new
occurrence
to
call
the
citizens
from
their
pursuits
the
prayers
for
the
dead
were
continued
with
little
intermission
and
masses
were
said
before
the
altars
of
half
the
churches
for
the
repose
of
the
fisherman
soul
his
comrades
a
little
distrustful
but
greatly
gratified
watched
the
ceremonies
with
jealousy
and
exultation
singularly
blended
ere
the
night
set
in
again
they
were
among
the
most
obedient
of
those
the
oligarchy
habitually
trod
upon
for
such
is
the
effect
of
this
species
of
domination
that
it
acquires
a
power
to
appease
by
its
flattery
the
very
discontents
created
by
its
injustice
such
is
the
human
mind
a
factitious
but
sentiment
of
respect
is
created
by
the
habit
of
submission
which
gives
the
subject
of
its
influence
a
feeling
of
atonement
when
he
who
has
long
played
the
superior
comes
down
from
his
stilts
and
confesses
the
community
of
human
frailties
the
square
of
mark
filled
at
the
usual
hour
the
patricians
deserted
the
broglio
as
of
wont
and
the
gaieties
of
the
place
were
again
uppermost
before
the
clock
had
struck
the
second
hour
of
the
night
gondolas
filled
with
noble
dames
appeared
on
the
canals
the
blinds
of
the
palaces
were
raised
for
the
admission
of
the
and
music
began
to
be
heard
in
the
port
on
the
bridges
and
under
the
balconies
of
the
fair
the
course
of
society
was
not
to
be
arrested
merely
because
the
wronged
were
unavenged
or
the
innocent
suffered
there
stood
then
on
the
grand
canal
as
there
stand
now
many
palaces
of
scarcely
less
than
royal
magnificence
the
reader
has
had
occasion
to
become
acquainted
with
one
or
two
of
these
splendid
edifices
and
it
is
now
our
duty
to
convey
him
in
imagination
to
another
the
peculiarity
of
construction
which
is
a
consequence
of
the
watery
site
of
venice
gives
the
same
general
character
to
all
the
superior
dwellings
of
that
remarkable
town
the
house
to
which
the
thread
of
the
narrative
now
leads
us
had
its
its
vestibule
its
massive
marble
stairs
its
inner
court
its
magnificent
suites
of
rooms
above
its
pictures
its
lustres
and
its
floors
of
precious
stones
embedded
in
composition
like
all
those
which
we
have
already
found
it
necessary
to
describe
the
hour
was
ten
according
to
our
own
manner
of
computing
time
a
small
but
lovely
family
picture
presented
itself
deep
within
the
walls
of
the
patrician
abode
to
which
we
have
alluded
there
was
a
father
a
gentleman
who
had
scarcely
attained
the
middle
age
with
an
eye
in
which
spirit
intelligence
philanthropy
and
at
that
moment
paternal
fondness
were
equally
glowing
he
tossed
in
his
arms
with
paternal
pride
a
laughing
urchin
of
some
three
or
four
years
who
rioted
in
the
amusement
which
brought
him
and
the
author
of
his
being
for
a
time
seemingly
on
a
level
a
fair
venetian
dame
with
golden
locks
and
glowing
cheeks
such
as
titian
loved
to
paint
her
sex
reclined
on
a
couch
nigh
by
following
the
movements
of
both
with
the
joint
feelings
of
mother
and
wife
and
laughing
in
pure
sympathy
with
the
noisy
merriment
of
her
young
hope
a
girl
who
was
the
youthful
image
of
herself
with
tresses
that
fell
to
her
waist
romped
with
a
crowing
infant
whose
age
was
so
tender
as
scarcely
to
admit
the
uncertain
evidence
of
its
intelligence
such
was
the
scene
as
the
clock
of
the
piazza
told
the
hour
struck
with
the
sound
the
father
set
down
the
boy
and
consulted
his
watch
dost
thou
use
thy
gondola
love
he
demanded
with
thee
paolo
not
with
me
dearest
i
have
affairs
which
will
employ
me
until
twelve
nay
thou
art
given
to
cast
me
off
when
thy
caprices
are
wayward
say
not
so
i
have
named
for
an
interview
with
my
agent
and
i
know
thy
maternal
heart
too
well
to
doubt
thy
being
willing
to
spare
me
for
that
time
while
i
look
to
the
interests
of
these
dear
ones
the
donna
giulietta
rang
for
her
mantle
and
attendants
the
crowing
infant
and
the
noisy
boy
were
dismissed
to
their
beds
while
the
lady
and
the
eldest
child
descended
to
the
gondola
donna
giulietta
was
not
permitted
to
go
unattended
to
her
boat
for
this
was
a
family
in
which
the
inclinations
had
fortunately
seconded
the
ordinary
calculations
of
interest
when
the
nuptial
knot
was
tied
her
husband
kissed
her
hand
fondly
as
he
assisted
her
into
the
gondola
and
the
boat
had
glided
some
distance
from
the
palace
ere
he
quitted
the
moist
stones
of
the
hast
thou
prepared
the
cabinet
for
my
friends
demanded
the
signor
soranzo
for
it
was
the
same
senator
who
had
been
in
company
with
the
doge
when
the
latter
went
to
meet
the
fishermen
signore
si
and
the
quiet
and
the
lights
as
ordered
eccellenza
all
will
be
done
thou
hast
placed
seats
for
six
we
shall
be
six
signore
there
are
six
is
well
when
the
first
of
my
friends
arrive
i
will
join
them
eccellenza
there
are
already
two
cavaliers
in
masks
within
the
signor
soranzo
started
again
consulted
his
watch
and
went
hastily
towards
a
distant
and
very
silent
part
of
the
palace
he
reached
a
small
door
unattended
and
closing
it
found
himself
at
once
in
the
presence
of
those
who
evidently
awaited
his
appearance
a
thousand
pardons
signori
cried
the
master
of
the
house
this
is
novel
duty
to
me
at
least
i
know
not
what
may
be
your
honorable
experience
and
the
time
stole
upon
me
unmarked
i
pray
for
grace
messires
future
diligence
shall
repair
the
present
neglect
both
the
visitors
were
older
men
than
their
host
and
it
was
quite
evident
by
their
hardened
visages
they
were
of
much
longer
practice
in
the
world
his
excuses
were
received
with
courtesy
and
for
a
little
time
the
discourse
was
entirely
of
usage
and
convention
we
are
in
secret
here
signore
asked
one
of
the
guests
after
some
little
time
had
been
wasted
in
this
manner
as
the
tomb
none
enter
here
unbidden
but
my
wife
and
she
has
this
moment
taken
boat
for
better
enjoyment
of
the
evening
the
world
gives
you
credit
signor
soranzo
for
a
happy
ménage
i
hope
you
have
duly
considered
the
necessity
of
shutting
the
door
even
against
the
donna
giulietta
doubt
me
not
signore
the
affairs
of
mark
are
paramount
i
feel
myself
thrice
happy
signori
that
in
drawing
a
lot
for
the
secret
council
my
good
fortune
hath
given
me
so
excellent
colleagues
believe
me
i
have
discharged
this
awful
trust
in
my
day
in
less
agreeable
company
this
flattering
speech
which
the
wily
old
senator
had
made
regularly
to
all
whom
chance
had
associated
with
him
in
the
inquisition
during
a
long
life
was
well
received
and
it
was
returned
with
equal
compliments
it
would
appear
that
the
worthy
signor
alessandro
gradenigo
was
one
of
our
predecessors
he
continued
looking
at
some
papers
for
though
the
actual
three
were
unknown
at
the
time
being
to
all
but
a
few
secretaries
and
officers
of
the
state
venetian
policy
transmitted
their
names
to
their
successors
as
a
matter
of
course
a
noble
gentleman
and
one
of
great
devotion
to
the
state
the
others
assented
like
men
accustomed
to
speak
with
caution
we
were
about
to
have
entered
on
our
duties
at
a
troublesome
moment
signori
observed
another
but
it
would
seem
that
this
tumult
of
the
fishermen
has
already
subsided
i
understand
the
knaves
had
some
reason
for
their
distrust
of
the
state
it
is
an
affair
happily
settled
answered
the
senior
of
the
three
who
was
long
practised
in
the
expediency
of
forgetting
all
that
policy
required
should
cease
to
be
remembered
after
the
object
was
attained
the
galleys
must
be
manned
else
would
mark
quickly
hang
his
head
in
shame
the
signor
soranzo
who
had
received
some
previous
instruction
in
his
new
duties
looked
melancholy
but
he
too
was
merely
the
creature
of
a
system
is
there
matter
of
pressing
import
for
our
reflection
he
demanded
signori
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
state
has
just
sustained
a
grievous
loss
ye
both
well
know
the
heiress
of
tiepolo
by
reputation
at
least
though
her
retired
manner
of
life
may
have
kept
you
from
her
company
donna
giulietta
is
eloquent
in
praise
of
her
beauty
said
the
young
husband
we
had
not
a
better
fortune
in
venice
rejoined
the
third
inquisitor
excellent
in
qualities
and
better
in
riches
as
she
is
i
fear
we
have
lost
her
signori
don
camillo
monforte
whom
god
protect
until
we
have
no
future
use
for
his
influence
had
come
near
to
prevail
against
us
but
just
as
the
state
baffled
his
well
laid
schemes
the
lady
has
been
thrown
by
hazard
into
the
hands
of
the
rioters
since
which
time
there
is
no
account
of
her
movements
paolo
soranzo
secretly
hoped
she
was
in
the
arms
of
the
neapolitan
a
secretary
has
communicated
to
me
the
disappearance
of
the
duca
di
sant
agata
also
observed
the
third
nor
is
the
felucca
usually
employed
in
distant
and
delicate
missions
any
longer
at
her
anchors
the
two
old
men
regarded
each
other
as
if
the
truth
was
beginning
to
dawn
upon
their
suspicions
they
saw
that
the
case
was
hopeless
and
as
theirs
was
altogether
a
practical
duty
no
time
was
lost
in
useless
regrets
we
have
two
affairs
which
press
observed
the
elder
the
body
of
the
old
fisherman
must
be
laid
quietly
in
the
earth
with
as
little
risk
of
future
tumult
as
may
be
and
we
have
this
notorious
jacopo
to
dispose
of
the
latter
must
first
be
taken
said
the
signor
soranzo
that
has
been
done
already
would
you
think
it
sirs
he
was
seized
in
the
very
palace
of
the
doge
to
the
block
with
him
without
delay
the
old
men
again
looked
at
each
other
and
it
was
quite
apparent
that
as
both
of
them
had
been
in
previous
councils
they
had
a
secret
intelligence
to
which
their
companion
was
yet
a
stranger
there
was
also
visible
in
their
glances
something
like
a
design
to
manage
his
feelings
before
they
came
more
openly
to
the
graver
practices
of
their
duties
for
the
sake
of
blessed
mark
signori
let
justice
be
done
openly
in
this
instance
continued
the
unsuspecting
member
of
the
three
what
pity
can
the
bearer
of
a
common
stiletto
claim
and
what
more
lovely
exercise
of
our
authority
than
to
make
public
an
act
of
severe
and
justice
the
old
senators
bowed
to
this
sentiment
of
their
colleague
which
was
uttered
with
the
fervor
of
young
experience
and
the
frankness
of
an
upright
mind
for
there
is
a
conventional
acquiescence
in
received
morals
which
is
permitted
in
semblance
at
least
to
adorn
the
most
tortuous
it
may
be
well
signore
soranzo
to
do
this
homage
to
the
right
returned
the
elder
here
have
been
sundry
charges
found
in
different
lions
mouths
against
the
neapolitan
signor
don
camillo
monforte
i
leave
it
to
your
wisdom
my
illustrious
colleagues
to
decide
on
their
character
an
excess
of
malice
betrays
its
own
origin
exclaimed
the
least
practised
member
of
the
inquisition
my
life
on
it
signori
these
accusations
come
of
private
spleen
and
are
unworthy
of
the
attention
i
have
consorted
much
with
the
young
lord
of
sant
agata
and
a
more
worthy
gentleman
does
not
dwell
among
us
still
hath
he
designs
on
the
hand
of
old
tiepolo
daughter
is
it
a
crime
in
youth
to
seek
beauty
he
did
great
service
to
the
lady
in
her
need
and
that
youth
should
feel
these
sympathies
is
nothing
strange
venice
hath
her
sympathies
as
well
as
the
youngest
of
us
all
signore
but
venice
can
not
wed
the
heiress
true
mark
must
be
satisfied
with
playing
the
prudent
part
you
are
yet
young
signore
soranzo
and
the
donna
giulietta
is
of
rare
beauty
as
life
wears
upon
ye
both
ye
will
see
the
fortunes
of
kingdoms
as
well
as
of
families
differently
but
we
waste
our
breath
uselessly
in
this
matter
since
our
agents
have
not
yet
reported
their
success
in
the
pursuit
the
most
pressing
affair
just
now
is
the
disposition
of
the
bravo
hath
his
highness
shown
you
the
letter
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
in
the
question
of
the
intercepted
dispatches
signore
he
hath
a
fair
answer
was
returned
by
our
predecessors
and
it
must
rest
there
we
will
then
look
freely
into
the
matter
of
jacopo
frontoni
there
will
be
necessity
of
our
assembling
in
the
chamber
of
the
inquisition
that
we
may
have
the
prisoner
confronted
to
his
accusers
is
a
grave
trial
signori
and
venice
would
lose
in
men
estimation
were
not
the
highest
tribunal
to
take
an
interest
in
its
decision
to
the
block
with
the
villain
again
exclaimed
the
signor
soranzo
he
may
haply
meet
with
that
fate
or
even
with
the
punishment
of
the
wheel
a
mature
examination
will
enlighten
us
much
on
the
course
which
policy
may
dictate
there
can
be
but
one
policy
when
the
protection
of
the
lives
of
our
citizens
is
in
question
i
have
never
before
felt
impatience
to
shorten
the
life
of
man
but
in
this
trial
i
can
scarce
brook
delay
your
honorable
impatience
shall
be
gratified
signor
soranzo
for
foreseeing
the
urgency
of
the
case
my
colleague
the
worthy
senator
who
is
joined
with
us
in
this
high
duty
and
myself
have
already
issued
the
commands
necessary
to
that
object
the
hour
is
near
and
we
will
repair
to
the
chamber
of
the
inquisition
in
time
to
our
duty
the
discourse
then
turned
on
subjects
of
a
more
general
concern
this
secret
and
extraordinary
tribunal
which
was
obliged
to
confine
its
meetings
to
no
particular
place
which
could
decide
on
its
decrees
equally
in
the
piazza
or
the
palace
amidst
the
revelries
of
the
masquerade
or
before
the
altar
in
the
assemblies
of
the
gay
or
in
their
own
closets
had
of
necessity
much
ordinary
matter
submitted
to
its
inspection
as
the
chances
of
birth
entered
into
its
original
composition
and
god
hath
not
made
all
alike
fit
for
so
heartless
a
duty
it
sometimes
happened
as
in
the
present
instance
that
the
more
worldly
of
its
members
had
to
overcome
the
generous
disposition
of
a
colleague
before
the
action
of
the
terrible
machine
could
go
on
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
communities
always
establish
a
higher
standard
of
justice
and
truth
than
is
exercised
by
their
individual
members
the
reason
is
not
to
be
sought
for
since
nature
hath
left
to
all
a
perception
of
that
right
which
is
abandoned
only
under
the
stronger
impulses
of
personal
temptation
we
commend
the
virtue
we
can
not
imitate
thus
it
is
that
those
countries
in
which
public
opinion
has
most
influence
are
always
of
the
purest
public
practice
it
follows
as
a
corollary
from
this
proposition
that
a
representation
should
be
as
real
as
possible
for
its
tendency
will
be
inevitably
to
elevate
national
morals
miserable
indeed
is
the
condition
of
that
people
whose
maxims
and
measures
of
public
policy
are
below
the
standard
of
its
private
integrity
for
the
fact
not
only
proves
it
is
not
the
master
of
its
own
destinies
but
the
still
more
dangerous
truth
that
the
collective
power
is
employed
in
the
fatal
service
of
undermining
those
very
qualities
which
are
necessary
to
virtue
and
which
have
enough
to
do
at
all
times
in
resisting
the
attacks
of
immediate
selfishness
a
strict
legal
representation
of
all
its
interests
is
far
more
necessary
to
a
worldly
than
to
a
simple
people
since
responsibility
which
is
the
essence
of
a
free
government
is
more
likely
to
keep
the
agents
of
a
nation
near
to
its
own
standard
of
virtue
than
any
other
means
the
common
opinion
that
a
republic
can
not
exist
without
an
extraordinary
degree
of
virtue
in
its
citizens
is
so
flattering
to
our
own
actual
condition
that
we
seldom
take
the
trouble
to
inquire
into
its
truth
but
to
us
it
seems
quite
apparent
that
the
effect
is
here
mistaken
for
the
cause
it
is
said
as
the
people
are
virtually
masters
in
a
republic
that
the
people
ought
to
be
virtuous
to
rule
well
so
far
as
this
proposition
is
confined
to
degrees
it
is
just
as
true
of
a
republic
as
of
any
other
form
of
government
but
kings
do
rule
and
surely
all
have
not
been
virtuous
and
that
aristocracies
have
ruled
with
the
very
minimum
of
that
quality
the
subject
of
our
tale
sufficiently
shows
that
other
things
being
equal
the
citizens
of
a
republic
will
have
a
higher
standard
of
private
virtue
than
the
subjects
of
any
other
form
of
government
is
true
as
an
effect
we
can
readily
believe
for
responsibility
to
public
opinion
existing
in
all
the
branches
of
its
administration
that
conventional
morality
which
characterizes
the
common
sentiment
will
be
left
to
act
on
the
mass
and
will
not
be
perverted
into
a
terrible
engine
of
corruption
as
is
the
case
when
factitious
institutions
give
a
false
direction
to
its
influence
the
case
before
us
was
in
proof
of
the
truth
of
what
has
here
been
said
the
signor
soranzo
was
a
man
of
great
natural
excellence
of
character
and
the
charities
of
his
domestic
circle
had
assisted
in
confirming
his
original
dispositions
like
others
of
his
rank
and
expectations
he
had
from
time
to
time
made
the
history
and
polity
of
the
republic
his
study
and
the
power
of
collective
interests
and
specious
necessities
had
made
him
admit
sundry
theories
which
presented
in
another
form
he
would
have
repulsed
with
indignation
still
the
signor
soranzo
was
far
from
understanding
the
full
effects
of
that
system
which
he
was
born
to
uphold
even
venice
paid
that
homage
to
public
opinion
of
which
there
has
just
been
question
and
held
forth
to
the
world
but
a
false
picture
of
her
true
state
maxims
still
many
of
those
which
were
too
apparent
to
be
concealed
were
difficult
of
acceptance
with
one
whose
mind
was
yet
untainted
with
practice
and
the
young
senator
rather
shut
his
eyes
on
their
tendency
or
as
he
felt
their
influence
in
every
interest
which
environed
him
but
that
of
poor
neglected
abstract
virtue
whose
rewards
were
so
remote
he
was
fain
to
seek
out
some
palliative
or
some
specious
and
indirect
good
as
the
excuse
for
his
acquiescence
in
this
state
of
mind
the
signor
soranzo
was
unexpectedly
admitted
a
member
of
the
council
of
three
often
in
the
of
his
youth
had
he
contemplated
the
possession
of
this
very
irresponsible
power
as
the
consummation
of
his
wishes
a
thousand
pictures
of
the
good
he
would
perform
had
crossed
his
brain
and
it
was
only
as
he
advanced
in
life
and
came
to
have
a
near
view
of
the
wiles
which
beset
the
that
he
could
bring
himself
to
believe
most
of
that
which
he
meditated
was
impracticable
as
it
was
he
entered
into
the
council
with
doubts
and
misgivings
had
he
lived
in
a
later
age
under
his
own
system
modified
by
the
knowledge
which
has
been
a
consequence
of
the
art
of
printing
it
is
probable
that
the
signor
soranzo
would
have
been
a
noble
in
opposition
now
supporting
with
ardor
some
measure
of
public
benevolence
and
now
yielding
gracefully
to
the
suggestions
of
a
sterner
policy
and
always
influenced
by
the
positive
advantages
he
was
born
to
possess
though
scarcely
conscious
himself
he
was
not
all
he
professed
to
be
the
fault
however
was
not
so
much
that
of
the
patrician
as
that
of
circumstances
which
by
placing
interest
in
opposition
to
duty
lures
many
a
benevolent
mind
into
still
greater
weaknesses
the
companions
of
the
signor
soranzo
however
had
a
more
difficult
task
to
prepare
him
for
the
duties
of
the
statesman
which
were
so
very
different
from
those
he
was
accustomed
to
perform
as
a
man
than
they
had
anticipated
they
were
like
two
trained
elephants
of
the
east
possessing
themselves
all
the
finer
instincts
and
generous
qualities
of
the
noble
animal
but
disciplined
by
a
force
quite
foreign
to
their
natural
condition
into
creatures
of
mere
convention
placed
one
on
each
side
of
a
younger
brother
fresh
from
the
plains
and
whom
it
was
their
duty
to
teach
new
services
for
the
trunk
new
affections
and
haply
the
manner
in
which
to
carry
with
dignity
the
howdah
of
a
rajah
with
many
allusions
to
their
policy
but
with
no
direct
intimation
of
their
own
intention
the
seniors
of
the
council
continued
the
conversation
until
the
hour
for
the
meeting
in
the
doge
palace
drew
nigh
they
then
separated
as
privately
as
they
had
come
together
in
order
that
no
vulgar
eye
might
penetrate
the
mystery
of
their
official
character
the
most
practised
of
the
three
appeared
in
an
assembly
of
the
patricians
which
noble
and
beautiful
dames
graced
with
their
presence
from
which
he
disappeared
in
a
manner
to
leave
no
clue
to
his
motions
the
other
visited
the
of
a
friend
where
he
discoursed
long
and
well
with
a
friar
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
the
hopes
of
a
christian
when
he
departed
the
godly
man
bestowing
his
blessing
and
the
family
he
left
being
loud
and
eloquent
in
his
praise
the
signor
soranzo
clung
to
the
enjoyments
of
his
own
family
circle
until
the
last
moment
the
donna
giulietta
had
returned
fresher
and
more
lovely
than
ever
from
the
invigorating
and
her
soft
voice
with
the
melodious
laugh
of
his
the
blooming
girl
described
still
rang
in
his
ears
when
his
gondolier
landed
him
beneath
the
bridge
of
the
rialto
here
he
masked
and
drawing
his
cloak
about
him
he
moved
with
the
current
towards
the
square
of
mark
by
means
of
the
narrow
streets
once
in
the
crowd
there
was
little
danger
of
impertinent
observation
disguise
was
as
often
useful
to
the
oligarchy
of
venice
as
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
elude
its
despotism
and
to
render
the
town
tolerable
to
the
citizen
paolo
saw
swarthy
men
of
the
lagunes
entering
occasionally
into
the
cathedral
he
followed
and
found
himself
standing
near
the
dimly
lighted
altar
at
which
masses
were
still
saying
for
the
soul
of
antonio
this
is
one
of
thy
fellows
he
asked
of
a
fisherman
whose
dark
eye
glittered
in
that
light
like
the
organ
of
a
basilisk
signore
he
was
a
more
honest
or
a
more
just
man
did
not
cast
his
net
in
the
gulf
he
has
fallen
a
victim
to
his
craft
cospetto
di
bacco
none
know
in
what
manner
he
came
by
his
end
some
say
mark
was
impatient
to
see
him
in
paradise
and
some
pretend
he
has
fallen
by
the
hand
of
a
common
bravo
named
jacopo
frontoni
why
should
a
bravo
take
the
life
of
one
like
this
by
having
the
goodness
to
answer
your
own
question
signore
you
will
spare
me
some
trouble
why
should
he
sure
enough
they
say
jacopo
is
revengeful
and
that
shame
and
anger
at
his
defeat
in
the
late
regatta
by
one
old
as
this
was
the
reason
is
he
so
jealous
of
his
honor
with
the
oar
diamine
i
have
seen
the
time
when
jacopo
would
sooner
die
than
lose
a
race
but
that
was
before
he
carried
a
stiletto
had
he
kept
to
his
oar
the
thing
might
have
happened
but
once
known
for
the
hired
blow
it
seems
unreasonable
he
should
set
his
heart
so
strongly
on
the
prizes
of
the
canals
may
not
the
man
have
fallen
into
the
lagunes
by
accident
no
doubt
signore
this
happens
to
some
of
us
daily
but
then
we
think
it
wiser
to
swim
to
the
boat
than
to
sink
old
antonio
had
an
arm
in
youth
to
carry
him
from
the
quay
to
the
lido
but
he
may
have
been
struck
in
falling
and
rendered
unable
to
do
himself
this
good
office
there
would
be
marks
to
show
this
were
it
true
signore
would
not
jacopo
have
used
the
stiletto
perhaps
not
on
one
like
antonio
the
gondola
of
the
old
man
was
found
in
the
mouth
of
the
grand
canal
half
a
league
from
the
body
and
against
the
wind
we
note
these
things
signore
for
they
are
within
our
knowledge
a
happy
night
to
thee
fisherman
a
most
happy
night
eccellenza
said
the
laborer
of
the
lagunes
gratified
with
having
so
long
occupied
the
attention
of
one
he
rightly
believed
so
much
his
superior
the
disguised
senator
passed
on
he
had
no
difficulty
in
quitting
the
cathedral
unobserved
and
he
had
his
private
means
of
entering
the
palace
without
attracting
any
impertinent
eye
to
his
movements
here
he
quickly
joined
his
colleagues
of
the
fearful
tribunal
chapter
xxviii
the
prisoners
rest
together
they
hear
not
the
voice
of
the
oppressor
job
the
manner
in
which
the
council
of
three
held
its
more
public
meetings
if
aught
connected
with
that
mysterious
body
could
be
called
public
has
already
been
seen
on
the
present
occasion
there
were
the
same
robes
the
same
disguises
and
the
same
officers
of
the
inquisition
as
in
the
scene
related
in
a
previous
chapter
the
only
change
was
in
the
character
of
the
judges
and
in
that
of
the
accused
by
a
peculiar
arrangement
of
the
lamp
too
most
of
the
light
was
thrown
upon
the
spot
it
was
intended
the
prisoner
should
occupy
while
the
side
of
the
apartment
on
which
the
inquisitors
sat
was
left
in
a
dimness
that
well
accorded
with
their
gloomy
and
secret
duties
previously
to
the
opening
of
the
door
by
which
the
person
to
be
examined
was
to
appear
there
was
audible
the
clanking
of
chains
the
certain
evidence
that
the
affair
in
hand
was
considered
serious
the
hinges
turned
and
the
bravo
stood
in
presence
of
those
unknown
men
who
were
to
decide
on
his
fate
as
jacopo
had
often
been
before
the
council
though
not
as
a
prisoner
he
betrayed
neither
surprise
nor
alarm
at
the
black
aspect
of
all
his
eye
beheld
his
features
were
composed
though
pale
his
limbs
immovable
and
his
mien
decent
when
the
little
bustle
of
his
entrance
had
subsided
there
reigned
a
stillness
in
the
room
thou
art
called
jacopo
frontoni
said
the
secretary
who
acted
as
the
of
the
three
on
this
occasion
i
am
thou
art
the
son
of
a
certain
ricardo
frontoni
a
man
well
known
as
having
been
concerned
in
robbing
the
republic
customs
and
who
is
thought
to
have
been
banished
to
the
distant
islands
or
to
be
otherwise
punished
signore
or
otherwise
punished
thou
wert
a
gondolier
in
thy
youth
i
was
a
gondolier
thy
mother
is
dead
said
jacopo
perceiving
the
other
paused
to
examine
his
notes
the
depth
of
the
tone
in
which
this
word
was
uttered
caused
a
silence
that
the
secretary
did
not
interrupt
until
he
had
thrown
a
glance
backwards
at
the
judges
she
was
not
accused
of
thy
father
crime
had
she
been
signore
she
is
long
since
beyond
the
power
of
the
republic
shortly
after
thy
father
fell
under
the
displeasure
of
the
state
thou
quittedst
thy
business
of
a
gondolier
signore
i
did
thou
art
accused
jacopo
of
having
laid
aside
the
oar
for
the
stiletto
signore
i
am
for
several
years
the
rumors
of
thy
bloody
deeds
have
been
growing
in
venice
until
of
late
none
have
met
with
an
untimely
fate
that
the
blow
has
not
been
attributed
to
thy
hand
this
is
too
true
signor
segretario
i
would
it
were
not
the
ears
of
his
highness
and
of
the
councils
have
not
been
closed
to
these
reports
but
they
have
long
attended
to
the
rumors
with
the
earnestness
which
becomes
a
paternal
and
careful
government
if
they
have
suffered
thee
to
go
at
large
it
hath
only
been
that
there
might
be
no
hazard
of
sullying
the
ermine
of
justice
by
a
premature
and
not
sufficiently
supported
judgment
jacopo
bent
his
head
but
without
speaking
a
smile
so
wild
and
meaning
however
gleamed
on
his
face
at
this
declaration
that
the
permanent
officer
of
the
secret
tribunal
he
who
served
as
its
organ
of
communication
bowed
nearly
to
the
paper
he
held
as
it
might
be
to
look
deeper
into
his
documents
let
not
the
reader
turn
back
to
this
page
in
surprise
when
he
shall
have
reached
the
explanation
of
the
tale
for
mysticisms
quite
as
palpable
if
not
of
so
ruthless
a
character
have
been
publicly
acted
by
political
bodies
in
his
own
times
there
is
now
a
specific
and
a
frightful
charge
brought
against
thee
jacopo
frontoni
continued
the
secretary
and
in
tenderness
of
the
citizen
life
the
dreaded
council
itself
hath
taken
the
matter
in
hand
didst
thou
know
a
certain
antonio
vecchio
a
fisherman
here
in
our
lagunes
signore
i
knew
him
well
of
late
and
much
regret
that
it
was
only
of
late
thou
knowest
too
that
his
body
hath
been
found
drowned
in
the
bay
jacopo
shuddered
signifying
his
assent
merely
by
a
sign
the
effect
of
this
tacit
acknowledgment
on
the
youngest
of
the
three
was
apparent
for
he
turned
to
his
companions
like
one
struck
by
the
confession
it
implied
his
colleagues
made
dignified
inclinations
in
return
and
the
silent
communication
ceased
his
death
has
excited
discontent
among
his
fellows
and
its
cause
has
become
a
serious
subject
of
inquiry
for
the
illustrious
council
the
death
of
the
meanest
man
in
venice
should
call
forth
the
care
of
the
patricians
signore
dost
thou
know
jacopo
that
thou
art
accused
of
being
his
murderer
signore
i
do
it
is
said
that
thou
earnest
among
the
gondoliers
in
the
late
regatta
and
that
but
for
this
aged
fisherman
thou
have
been
winner
of
the
prize
in
that
rumor
hath
not
lied
signore
thou
dost
not
then
deny
the
charge
said
the
examiner
in
evident
surprise
it
is
certain
that
but
for
the
fisherman
i
should
have
been
the
winner
and
thou
wished
it
jacopo
signore
greatly
returned
the
accused
with
a
show
of
emotion
that
had
not
hitherto
escaped
him
i
was
a
man
condemned
of
his
fellows
and
the
oar
had
been
my
pride
from
childhood
to
that
hour
another
movement
of
the
third
inquisitor
betrayed
equally
his
interest
and
his
surprise
dost
thou
confess
the
crime
jacopo
smiled
but
more
in
derision
than
with
any
other
feeling
if
the
illustrious
senators
here
present
will
unmask
i
may
answer
that
question
haply
with
greater
confidence
he
said
thy
request
is
bold
and
out
of
rule
none
know
the
persons
of
the
patricians
who
preside
over
the
destinies
of
the
state
dost
thou
confess
the
crime
the
entrance
of
an
officer
in
some
haste
prevented
a
reply
the
man
placed
a
written
report
in
the
hands
of
the
inquisitor
in
red
and
withdrew
after
a
short
pause
the
guards
were
ordered
to
retire
with
their
prisoner
great
senators
said
jacopo
advancing
earnestly
towards
the
table
as
if
he
would
seize
the
moment
to
urge
what
he
was
about
to
say
mercy
grant
me
your
authority
to
visit
one
in
the
prisons
beneath
the
leads
i
have
weighty
reasons
for
the
wish
and
i
pray
you
as
men
and
fathers
to
grant
it
the
interest
of
the
two
who
were
consulting
apart
on
the
new
intelligence
prevented
them
from
listening
to
what
he
urged
the
other
inquisitor
who
was
the
signer
soranzo
had
drawn
near
the
lamp
anxious
to
read
the
lineaments
of
one
so
notorious
and
was
gazing
at
his
striking
countenance
touched
by
the
pathos
of
his
voice
and
agreeably
disappointed
in
the
lineaments
he
studied
he
took
upon
himself
the
power
to
grant
the
request
humor
his
wish
he
said
to
the
halberdiers
but
have
him
in
readiness
to
reappear
jacopo
looked
his
gratitude
but
fearful
that
the
others
might
still
interfere
to
prevent
his
wish
he
hurried
from
the
room
the
march
of
the
little
procession
which
proceeded
from
the
chamber
of
the
inquisition
to
the
summer
cells
of
its
victims
was
sadly
characteristic
of
the
place
and
the
government
it
went
through
gloomy
and
secret
corridors
that
were
hid
from
the
vulgar
eye
while
thin
partitions
only
separated
them
from
the
apartments
of
the
doge
which
like
the
specious
aspect
of
the
state
concealed
the
nakedness
and
misery
within
by
their
gorgeousness
and
splendor
on
reaching
the
attic
jacopo
stopped
and
turned
to
his
conductors
if
you
are
beings
of
god
forming
he
said
take
off
these
clanking
chains
though
it
be
but
for
a
moment
the
keepers
regarded
each
other
in
surprise
neither
offering
to
do
the
charitable
office
i
go
to
visit
probably
for
the
last
time
continued
the
prisoner
a
i
may
say
a
dying
father
who
knows
nothing
of
my
situation
will
ye
that
he
should
see
me
thus
the
appeal
which
was
made
more
with
the
voice
and
manner
than
in
the
words
had
its
effect
a
keeper
removed
the
chains
and
bade
him
proceed
with
a
cautious
tread
jacopo
advanced
and
when
the
door
was
opened
he
entered
the
room
alone
for
none
there
had
sufficient
interest
in
an
interview
between
a
common
bravo
and
his
father
to
endure
the
glowing
warmth
of
the
place
the
while
the
door
was
closed
after
him
and
the
room
became
dark
notwithstanding
his
assumed
firmness
jacopo
hesitated
when
he
found
himself
so
suddenly
introduced
to
the
silent
misery
of
the
forlorn
captive
a
hard
breathing
told
him
the
situation
of
the
pallet
but
the
walls
which
were
solid
on
the
side
of
the
corridor
effectually
prevented
the
admission
of
light
father
said
jacopo
with
gentleness
he
got
no
answer
father
he
repeated
in
a
stronger
voice
the
breathing
became
more
audible
and
then
the
captive
spoke
holy
maria
hear
my
prayers
he
said
feebly
god
hath
sent
thee
son
to
close
my
eyes
doth
thy
strength
fail
thee
father
greatly
my
time
is
come
i
had
hoped
to
see
the
light
of
the
day
again
to
bless
thy
dear
mother
and
sister
god
will
be
done
they
pray
for
us
both
father
they
are
beyond
the
power
of
the
senate
jacopo
i
do
not
understand
thee
my
mother
and
sister
are
dead
they
are
saints
in
heaven
father
the
old
man
groaned
for
the
tie
of
earth
had
not
yet
been
entirely
severed
jacopo
heard
him
murmuring
a
prayer
and
he
knelt
by
the
side
of
his
pallet
this
is
a
sudden
blow
whispered
the
old
man
we
depart
together
they
are
long
dead
father
why
hast
thou
not
told
me
this
before
jacopo
hadst
thou
not
sorrows
enough
without
this
now
that
thou
art
about
to
join
them
it
will
be
pleasant
to
know
that
they
have
so
long
been
happy
and
thou
thou
wilt
be
alone
give
me
thy
hand
poor
jacopo
the
bravo
reached
forth
and
took
the
feeble
member
of
his
parent
it
was
clammy
and
cold
jacopo
continued
the
captive
whose
mind
still
sustained
the
body
i
have
prayed
thrice
within
the
hour
once
for
my
own
soul
once
for
the
peace
of
thy
mother
lastly
for
thee
bless
thee
father
bless
thee
i
have
need
of
prayer
i
have
asked
of
god
favor
in
thy
behalf
i
have
bethought
me
of
all
thy
love
and
care
of
all
thy
devotion
to
my
age
and
sufferings
when
thou
wert
a
child
jacopo
tenderness
for
thee
tempted
me
to
acts
of
weakness
i
trembled
lest
thy
manhood
might
bring
upon
me
pain
and
repentance
thou
hast
not
known
the
yearnings
of
a
parent
for
his
offspring
but
thou
hast
well
requited
them
kneel
jacopo
that
i
may
ask
of
god
once
more
to
remember
thee
i
am
at
thy
side
father
the
old
man
raised
his
feeble
arms
and
with
a
voice
whose
force
appeared
reviving
he
pronounced
a
fervent
and
solemn
benediction
the
blessing
of
a
dying
parent
will
sweeten
thy
life
jacopo
he
added
after
a
pause
and
give
peace
to
thy
last
moments
it
will
do
the
latter
father
a
rude
summons
at
the
door
interrupted
them
come
forth
jacopo
said
a
keeper
the
council
seeks
thee
jacopo
felt
the
convulsive
start
of
his
father
but
he
did
not
answer
will
they
not
leave
thee
a
few
minutes
longer
whispered
the
old
man
i
shall
not
keep
thee
long
the
door
opened
and
a
gleam
from
the
lamp
fell
on
the
group
in
the
cell
the
keeper
had
the
humanity
to
shut
it
again
leaving
all
in
obscurity
the
glimpse
which
jacopo
obtained
by
that
passing
light
was
the
last
look
he
had
of
his
father
countenance
death
was
fearfully
on
it
but
the
eyes
were
turned
in
unutterable
affection
on
his
own
the
man
is
merciful
he
will
not
shut
thee
out
murmured
the
parent
they
can
not
leave
thee
to
die
alone
father
son
i
am
with
my
god
yet
i
would
gladly
have
thee
by
my
side
didst
thou
say
thy
mother
and
thy
sister
were
dead
dead
thy
young
sister
too
father
both
they
are
saints
in
heaven
the
old
man
breathed
thick
and
there
was
silence
jacopo
felt
a
hand
moving
in
the
darkness
as
if
in
quest
of
him
he
aided
the
effort
and
laid
the
member
in
reverence
on
his
own
head
maria
undefiled
and
her
son
who
is
god
bless
thee
jacopo
whispered
a
voice
that
to
the
excited
imagination
of
the
kneeling
bravo
appeared
to
hover
in
the
air
the
solemn
words
were
followed
by
a
quivering
sigh
jacopo
hid
his
face
in
the
blanket
and
prayed
after
which
there
was
deep
quiet
father
he
added
trembling
at
his
own
smothered
voice
he
was
unanswered
stretching
out
a
hand
it
touched
the
features
of
a
corpse
with
a
firmness
that
had
the
quality
of
desperation
he
again
bowed
his
head
and
uttered
fervently
a
prayer
for
the
dead
when
the
door
of
the
cell
opened
jacopo
appeared
to
the
keepers
with
a
dignity
of
air
that
belongs
only
to
character
and
which
was
heightened
by
the
scene
in
which
he
had
just
been
an
actor
he
raised
his
hands
and
stood
immovable
while
the
manacles
were
replaced
this
office
done
they
walked
away
together
in
the
direction
of
the
secret
chamber
it
was
not
long
ere
all
were
again
in
their
places
before
the
council
of
three
jacopo
frontoni
resumed
the
secretary
thou
art
suspected
of
being
privy
to
another
dark
deed
that
hath
had
place
of
late
within
our
city
hast
thou
any
knowledge
of
a
noble
calabrian
who
hath
high
claim
to
the
senate
honors
and
who
hath
long
had
his
abode
in
venice
signore
i
have
hast
thou
had
aught
of
concern
with
him
signore
yes
a
movement
of
common
interest
made
itself
apparent
among
the
auditors
dost
thou
know
where
the
don
camillo
monforte
is
at
present
jacopo
hesitated
he
so
well
understood
the
means
of
intelligence
possessed
by
the
council
that
he
doubted
how
far
it
might
be
prudent
to
deny
his
connexion
with
the
flight
of
the
lovers
besides
at
that
moment
his
mind
was
deeply
impressed
with
a
holy
sentiment
of
truth
canst
thou
say
why
the
young
duca
is
not
to
be
found
in
his
palace
repeated
the
secretary
illustrissimo
he
hath
quitted
venice
for
ever
how
canst
thou
know
this
would
he
make
a
confidant
of
a
common
bravo
the
smile
which
crossed
the
features
of
jacopo
was
full
of
superiority
it
caused
the
conscious
agent
of
the
secret
tribunal
to
look
closely
at
his
papers
like
one
who
felt
its
power
art
thou
his
confidant
i
ask
again
signore
in
this
i
am
i
have
the
assurance
from
the
mouth
of
don
camillo
monforte
himself
that
he
will
not
return
this
is
impossible
since
it
would
involve
a
loss
of
all
his
fair
hopes
and
illustrious
fortunes
he
consoled
himself
signore
with
the
possession
of
the
heiress
of
tiepolo
love
and
with
her
riches
again
there
was
a
movement
among
the
three
which
all
their
practised
restraint
and
the
conventional
dignity
of
their
mysterious
functions
could
not
prevent
let
the
keepers
withdraw
said
the
inquisitor
of
the
scarlet
robe
so
soon
as
the
prisoner
was
alone
with
the
three
and
their
permanent
officer
the
examination
continued
the
senators
themselves
trusting
to
the
effect
produced
by
their
masks
and
some
feints
speaking
as
occasion
offered
this
is
important
intelligence
that
thou
hast
communicated
jacopo
continued
he
of
the
robe
of
flame
it
may
yet
redeem
thy
life
wert
thou
wise
enough
to
turn
it
to
account
what
would
your
eccellenza
at
my
hands
it
is
plain
that
the
council
know
of
the
flight
of
don
camillo
nor
will
i
believe
that
eyes
which
so
seldom
are
closed
have
not
yet
missed
the
daughter
of
the
tiepolo
both
are
true
jacopo
but
what
hast
thou
to
say
of
the
means
remember
that
as
thou
findest
favor
with
the
council
thine
own
fate
will
be
decided
the
prisoner
suffered
another
of
those
freezing
gleams
to
cross
his
face
which
invariably
caused
his
examiners
to
bend
their
looks
aside
the
means
of
escape
can
not
be
wanting
to
a
bold
lover
signore
he
replied
don
camillo
is
rich
and
might
employ
a
thousand
agents
had
he
need
of
them
thou
art
equivocating
be
the
worse
for
thee
that
thou
triflest
with
the
council
who
are
these
agents
he
had
a
generous
household
eccellenza
many
hardy
gondoliers
and
servitors
of
all
conditions
of
these
we
have
nothing
to
learn
he
hath
escaped
by
other
means
or
art
thou
sure
he
hath
escaped
at
all
signore
is
he
in
venice
nay
that
we
ask
of
thee
here
is
an
accusation
found
in
the
mouth
which
charges
thee
with
his
assassination
and
the
donna
violetta
too
eccellenza
of
her
we
have
heard
nothing
what
answer
dost
make
to
the
charge
signore
why
should
i
betray
my
own
secrets
ha
art
thou
equivocating
and
faithless
remember
that
we
have
a
prisoner
beneath
the
leads
who
can
extract
the
truth
from
thee
jacopo
raised
his
form
to
such
an
altitude
as
one
might
fancy
to
express
the
mounting
of
a
liberated
spirit
still
his
eye
was
sad
and
spite
of
an
effort
to
the
contrary
his
voice
melancholy
senators
he
said
your
prisoner
beneath
the
leads
is
free
how
thou
art
trifling
in
thy
despair
i
speak
truth
the
liberation
so
long
delayed
hath
come
at
last
thy
father
is
dead
interrupted
jacopo
solemnly
the
two
elder
members
of
the
council
looked
at
each
other
in
surprise
while
their
junior
colleague
listened
with
the
interest
of
one
who
was
just
entering
on
a
noviciate
of
secret
and
embarrassing
duties
the
former
consulted
together
and
then
they
communicated
as
much
of
their
opinions
to
the
signor
soranzo
as
they
deemed
necessary
to
the
occasion
wilt
thou
consult
thine
own
safety
jacopo
and
reveal
all
thou
knowest
of
this
affair
of
the
neapolitan
continued
the
inquisitor
when
this
was
ended
jacopo
betrayed
no
weakness
at
the
menace
implied
by
the
words
of
the
senator
but
after
a
moment
reflection
he
answered
writh
as
much
frankness
as
he
could
have
used
at
the
confessional
it
is
known
to
you
illustrious
senator
he
said
that
the
state
had
a
desire
to
match
the
heiress
of
tiepolo
to
its
own
advantage
that
she
was
beloved
of
the
neapolitan
noble
and
that
as
is
wont
between
young
and
virtuous
hearts
she
returned
his
love
as
became
a
maiden
of
her
high
condition
and
tender
years
is
there
anything
extraordinary
in
the
circumstance
that
two
of
so
illustrious
hopes
should
struggle
to
prevent
their
own
misery
signori
the
night
that
old
antonio
died
i
was
alone
among
the
graves
of
the
lido
with
many
melancholy
and
bitter
thoughts
and
life
had
become
a
burden
to
me
had
the
evil
spirit
which
was
then
uppermost
maintained
its
mastery
i
might
have
died
the
death
of
a
hopeless
suicide
god
sent
don
camillo
monforte
to
my
succor
praised
be
the
immaculate
maria
and
her
blessed
son
for
the
mercy
it
was
there
i
learned
the
wishes
of
the
neapolitan
and
enlisted
myself
in
his
service
i
swore
to
him
senators
of
venice
to
be
true
to
die
in
his
cause
should
it
be
necessary
and
to
help
him
to
his
bride
this
pledge
have
i
redeemed
the
happy
lovers
are
now
in
the
states
of
the
church
and
under
the
puissant
protection
of
the
cardinal
secretary
don
camillo
mother
brother
fool
why
thou
this
thou
no
thought
for
thyself
eccellenza
but
little
i
thought
more
of
finding
a
human
bosom
to
pour
out
my
sufferings
to
than
of
your
high
displeasure
i
have
not
known
so
sweet
a
moment
in
years
as
that
in
which
i
saw
the
lord
of
sant
agata
fold
his
beautiful
and
weeping
bride
to
his
heart
the
inquisitors
were
struck
with
the
quiet
enthusiasm
of
the
bravo
and
surprise
once
more
held
them
in
suspense
at
length
the
elder
of
the
three
resumed
the
examination
wilt
thou
impart
the
manner
of
this
escape
jacopo
he
demanded
remember
thou
hast
still
a
life
to
redeem
signore
it
is
scarce
worth
the
trouble
but
to
do
your
pleasure
nothing
shall
be
concealed
jacopo
then
recounted
in
simple
and
undisguised
terms
the
entire
means
employed
by
don
camillo
in
effecting
his
escape
his
hopes
his
disappointments
and
his
final
success
in
this
narrative
nothing
was
concealed
but
the
place
in
which
the
ladies
had
temporarily
taken
refuge
and
the
name
of
gelsomina
even
the
attempt
of
giacomo
gradenigo
on
the
life
of
the
neapolitan
and
the
agency
of
the
hebrew
were
fully
exposed
none
listened
to
this
explanation
so
intently
as
the
young
husband
notwithstanding
his
public
duties
his
pulses
quickened
as
the
prisoner
dwelt
on
the
different
chances
of
the
lovers
and
when
their
final
union
was
proclaimed
he
felt
his
heart
bound
with
delight
on
the
other
hand
his
more
practised
colleagues
heard
the
detail
of
the
bravo
with
politic
coolness
the
effect
of
all
factitious
systems
is
to
render
the
feelings
subservient
to
expediency
convention
and
fiction
take
place
of
passion
and
truth
and
like
the
mussulman
with
his
doctrine
of
predestination
there
is
no
one
more
acquiescent
in
defeat
than
he
who
has
obtained
an
advantage
in
the
face
of
nature
and
justice
his
resignation
being
in
common
as
perfect
as
his
previous
arrogance
was
insupportable
the
two
old
senators
perceived
at
once
that
don
camillo
and
his
fair
companion
were
completely
beyond
the
reach
of
their
power
and
they
instantly
admitted
the
wisdom
of
making
a
merit
of
necessity
having
no
farther
occasion
for
jacopo
they
summoned
the
keepers
and
dismissed
him
to
his
cell
it
will
be
seemly
to
send
letters
of
congratulation
to
the
cardinal
secretary
on
the
union
of
his
nephew
with
so
rich
an
heiress
of
our
city
said
the
inquisitor
of
the
ten
as
the
door
closed
on
the
retiring
group
so
great
an
interest
as
that
of
the
neapolitan
should
be
propitiated
but
should
he
urge
the
state
resistance
to
his
hopes
returned
the
signor
soranzo
in
feeble
objection
to
so
bold
a
scheme
we
will
excuse
it
as
the
act
of
a
former
council
these
misconceptions
are
the
unavoidable
consequences
of
the
caprices
of
liberty
signore
the
steed
that
ranges
the
plains
in
the
freedom
of
nature
can
not
be
held
to
perfect
command
like
the
dull
beast
that
draws
the
car
this
is
the
first
of
your
sittings
in
the
three
but
experience
will
show
you
that
excellent
as
we
are
in
system
we
are
not
quite
perfect
in
practice
this
is
grave
matter
of
the
young
gradenigo
signori
i
have
long
known
his
unworthiness
returned
his
more
aged
colleague
it
is
a
thousand
pities
that
so
honorable
and
so
noble
a
patrician
should
have
produced
so
ignoble
a
child
but
neither
the
state
nor
the
city
can
tolerate
assassination
would
it
were
less
frequent
exclaimed
the
signore
soranzo
in
perfect
sincerity
would
it
were
indeed
there
are
hints
in
our
secret
information
which
tend
to
confirm
the
charge
of
jacopo
though
long
experience
has
taught
us
to
put
full
faith
in
his
reports
how
is
jacopo
then
an
agent
of
the
police
of
that
more
at
our
leisure
signor
soranzo
at
present
we
must
look
to
this
attempt
on
the
life
of
one
protected
by
our
laws
the
three
then
entered
into
a
serious
discussion
of
the
case
of
the
two
delinquents
venice
like
all
despotic
governments
had
the
merit
of
great
efficiency
in
its
criminal
police
when
it
was
disposed
to
exert
it
justice
was
sure
enough
in
those
instances
in
which
the
interests
of
the
government
itself
were
not
involved
or
in
which
bribery
could
not
well
be
used
as
to
the
latter
through
the
jealousy
of
the
state
and
the
constant
agency
of
those
who
were
removed
from
temptation
by
being
already
in
possession
of
a
monopoly
of
benefits
it
was
by
no
means
as
frequent
as
in
some
other
communities
in
which
the
affluent
were
less
interested
the
signor
soranzo
had
now
a
fair
occasion
for
the
exercise
of
his
generous
feelings
though
related
to
the
house
of
gradenigo
he
was
not
backward
in
decrying
the
conduct
of
its
heir
his
first
impulses
were
to
make
a
terrible
example
of
the
accused
and
to
show
the
world
that
no
station
brought
with
it
in
venice
impunity
for
crime
from
this
view
of
the
case
however
he
was
gradually
enticed
by
his
companions
who
reminded
him
that
the
law
commonly
made
a
distinction
between
the
intention
and
the
execution
of
an
offence
driven
from
his
first
determination
by
the
cooler
heads
of
his
colleagues
the
young
inquisitor
next
proposed
that
the
case
should
be
sent
to
the
ordinary
tribunals
for
judgment
instances
had
not
been
wanting
in
which
the
aristocracy
of
venice
sacrificed
one
of
its
body
to
the
seemliness
of
justice
for
when
such
cases
were
managed
with
discretion
they
rather
strengthened
than
weakened
their
ascendency
but
the
present
crime
was
known
to
be
too
common
to
permit
so
lavish
an
expenditure
of
their
immunities
and
the
old
inquisitors
opposed
the
wish
of
their
younger
colleague
with
great
plausibility
and
with
some
show
of
reason
it
was
finally
resolved
that
they
should
themselves
decide
on
the
case
the
next
question
was
the
degree
of
punishment
the
wily
senior
of
the
council
began
by
proposing
a
banishment
for
a
few
months
for
giacomo
gradenigo
was
already
obnoxious
to
the
anger
of
the
state
on
more
accounts
than
one
but
this
punishment
was
resisted
by
the
signor
soranzo
with
the
ardor
of
an
uncorrupted
and
generous
mind
the
latter
gradually
prevailed
his
companions
taking
care
that
their
compliance
should
have
the
air
of
a
concession
to
his
arguments
the
result
of
all
this
management
was
that
the
heir
of
gradenigo
was
condemned
to
ten
years
retirement
in
the
provinces
and
hosea
to
banishment
for
life
should
the
reader
be
of
opinion
that
strict
justice
was
not
meted
out
to
the
offenders
he
should
remember
that
the
hebrew
ought
to
be
glad
to
have
escaped
as
he
did
we
must
not
conceal
this
judgment
nor
its
motive
observed
the
inquisitor
of
the
ten
when
the
affair
was
concluded
the
state
is
never
a
loser
for
letting
its
justice
be
known
nor
for
its
exercise
i
should
hope
returned
the
signor
soranzo
as
our
affairs
are
ended
for
the
night
is
it
your
pleasures
signori
that
we
return
to
our
palaces
nay
we
have
this
matter
of
jacopo
him
may
we
now
surely
turn
over
to
the
ordinary
tribunals
as
you
may
decide
signori
is
this
your
pleasure
both
the
others
bowed
assent
and
the
usual
preparations
were
made
for
departure
ere
the
two
seniors
of
the
council
left
the
palace
however
they
held
a
long
and
secret
conference
together
the
result
was
a
private
order
to
the
criminal
judge
and
then
they
returned
each
to
his
own
abode
like
men
who
had
the
approbation
of
their
own
consciences
on
the
other
hand
the
signor
soranzo
hastened
to
his
own
luxurious
and
happy
dwelling
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
entered
it
with
a
distrust
of
himself
without
being
conscious
of
the
reason
he
felt
sad
for
he
had
taken
the
first
step
in
that
tortuous
and
corrupting
path
which
eventually
leads
to
the
destruction
of
all
those
generous
and
noble
sentiments
which
can
only
flourish
apart
from
the
sophistry
and
fictions
of
selfishness
he
would
have
rejoiced
to
have
been
as
light
of
heart
as
at
the
moment
he
handed
his
partner
into
the
gondola
that
night
but
his
head
had
pressed
the
pillow
for
many
hours
before
sleep
drew
a
veil
over
the
solemn
trifling
with
the
most
serious
of
your
duties
in
which
he
had
been
an
actor

the
following
morning
brought
the
funeral
of
antonio
the
agents
of
the
police
took
the
precaution
to
circulate
in
the
city
that
the
senate
permitted
this
honor
to
the
memory
of
the
old
fisherman
on
account
of
his
success
in
the
regatta
and
as
some
atonement
for
his
unmerited
and
mysterious
death
all
the
men
of
the
lagunes
were
assembled
in
the
square
at
the
appointed
hour
in
decent
guise
flattered
with
the
notice
that
their
craft
received
and
more
than
half
disposed
to
forget
their
former
anger
in
the
present
favor
thus
easy
is
it
for
those
who
are
elevated
above
their
by
the
accident
of
birth
or
by
the
opinions
of
a
factitious
social
organization
to
repair
the
wrongs
they
do
in
deeds
by
small
concessions
of
their
conventional
superiority
masses
were
still
chanted
for
the
soul
of
old
antonio
before
the
altar
of
mark
foremost
among
the
priests
was
the
good
carmelite
who
had
scarce
known
hunger
or
fatigue
in
his
pious
desire
to
do
the
offices
of
the
church
in
behalf
of
one
whose
fate
he
might
be
said
to
have
witnessed
his
zeal
however
in
that
moment
of
excitement
passed
unnoticed
by
all
but
those
whose
business
it
was
to
suffer
no
unusual
display
of
character
nor
any
unwonted
circumstance
to
have
place
without
attracting
their
suspicion
as
the
carmelite
finally
withdrew
from
the
altar
previously
to
the
removal
of
the
body
he
felt
the
sleeve
of
his
robe
slightly
drawn
aside
and
yielding
to
the
impulse
he
quickly
found
himself
among
the
columns
of
that
gloomy
church
alone
with
a
stranger
father
thou
hast
shrived
many
a
parting
soul
observed
rather
than
asked
the
other
it
is
the
duty
of
my
holy
office
son
the
state
will
note
thy
services
there
will
be
need
of
thee
when
the
body
of
this
fisherman
is
committed
to
the
earth
the
monk
shuddered
but
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
he
bowed
his
pale
face
in
signification
of
his
readiness
to
discharge
the
duty
at
that
moment
the
bearers
lifted
the
body
and
the
procession
issued
upon
the
great
square
first
marched
the
usual
lay
underlings
of
the
cathedral
who
were
followed
by
those
who
chanted
the
offices
of
the
occasion
among
the
latter
the
carmelite
hastened
to
take
his
station
next
came
the
corpse
without
a
coffin
for
that
is
a
luxury
of
the
grave
even
now
unknown
to
the
italians
of
old
antonio
degree
the
body
was
clad
in
the
holiday
vestments
of
a
fisherman
the
hands
and
feet
being
naked
a
cross
lay
on
the
breast
the
grey
hairs
were
blowing
about
in
the
air
and
in
frightful
adornment
of
the
ghastliness
of
death
a
bouquet
of
flowers
was
placed
upon
the
mouth
the
bier
was
rich
in
gilding
and
carving
another
melancholy
evidence
of
the
lingering
wishes
and
false
direction
of
human
vanity
next
to
this
characteristic
equipage
of
the
dead
walked
a
lad
whose
brown
cheek
body
and
dark
roving
eye
announced
the
grandson
of
the
fisherman
venice
knew
when
to
yield
gracefully
and
the
boy
was
liberated
unconditionally
from
the
galleys
in
pity
as
it
was
whispered
for
the
untimely
fate
of
his
parent
there
was
the
aspiring
look
the
dauntless
spirit
and
the
rigid
honesty
of
antonio
in
the
bearing
of
the
lad
but
these
qualities
were
now
smothered
by
a
natural
grief
and
as
in
the
case
of
him
whose
funeral
escort
he
followed
something
obscured
by
the
rude
chances
of
his
lot
from
time
to
time
the
bosom
of
the
generous
boy
heaved
as
they
marched
along
the
quay
taking
the
route
of
the
arsenal
and
there
were
moments
in
which
his
lips
quivered
grief
threatening
to
overcome
his
manhood
still
not
a
tear
wetted
his
cheek
until
the
body
disappeared
from
his
view
then
nature
triumphed
and
straying
from
out
the
circle
he
took
a
seat
apart
and
wept
as
one
of
his
years
and
simplicity
would
be
apt
to
weep
at
finding
himself
a
solitary
wanderer
in
the
wilderness
of
the
world
thus
terminated
the
incident
of
antonio
vecchio
the
fisherman
whose
name
soon
ceased
to
be
mentioned
in
that
city
of
mysteries
except
on
the
lagunes
where
the
men
of
his
craft
long
vaunted
his
merit
with
the
net
and
the
manner
in
which
he
bore
away
the
prize
from
the
best
oars
of
venice
his
descendant
lived
and
toiled
like
others
of
his
condition
and
we
will
here
dismiss
him
by
saying
that
he
so
far
inherited
the
native
qualities
of
his
ancestor
that
he
forbore
to
appear
a
few
hours
later
in
the
crowd
which
curiosity
and
vengeance
drew
into
the
piazzetta
father
anselmo
took
boat
to
return
to
the
canals
and
when
he
landed
at
the
quay
of
the
smaller
square
it
was
with
the
hope
that
he
would
now
be
permitted
to
seek
those
of
whose
fate
he
was
still
ignorant
but
in
whom
he
felt
so
deep
an
interest
not
so
however
the
individual
who
had
addressed
him
in
the
cathedral
was
apparently
in
waiting
and
knowing
the
uselessness
as
well
as
the
danger
of
remonstrance
where
the
state
was
concerned
the
carmelite
permitted
himself
to
be
conducted
whither
his
guide
pleased
they
took
a
devious
route
but
it
led
them
to
the
public
prisons
here
the
priest
was
shown
into
the
keeper
apartment
where
he
was
desired
to
wait
a
summons
from
his
companion
our
business
now
leads
us
to
the
cell
of
jacopo
on
quitting
the
presence
of
the
three
he
had
been
remanded
to
his
gloomy
room
where
he
passed
the
night
like
others
similarly
situated
with
the
appearance
of
the
dawn
the
bravo
had
been
led
before
those
who
ostensibly
discharged
the
duties
of
his
judges
we
say
ostensibly
for
justice
never
yet
was
pure
under
a
system
in
which
the
governors
have
an
interest
in
the
least
separated
from
that
of
the
governed
for
in
all
cases
which
involve
the
ascendency
of
the
existing
authorities
the
instinct
of
is
as
certain
to
bias
their
decision
as
that
of
life
is
to
cause
man
to
shun
danger
if
such
is
the
fact
in
countries
of
milder
sway
the
reader
will
easily
believe
in
its
existence
in
a
state
like
that
of
venice
as
may
have
been
anticipated
those
who
sat
in
judgment
on
jacopo
had
their
instructions
and
the
trial
that
he
sustained
was
rather
a
concession
to
appearances
than
a
homage
to
the
laws
all
the
records
were
duly
made
witnesses
were
examined
or
said
to
be
examined
and
care
was
had
to
spread
the
rumor
in
the
city
that
the
tribunals
were
at
length
occupied
in
deciding
on
the
case
of
the
extraordinary
man
who
had
so
long
been
permitted
to
exercise
his
bloody
profession
with
impunity
even
in
the
centre
of
the
canals
during
the
morning
the
credulous
tradesmen
were
much
engaged
in
recounting
to
each
other
the
different
flagrant
deeds
that
in
the
course
of
the
last
three
or
four
years
had
been
imputed
to
his
hand
one
spoke
of
the
body
of
a
stranger
that
had
been
found
near
the
frequented
by
those
who
visited
venice
another
recalled
the
fate
of
the
young
noble
who
had
fallen
by
the
assassin
blow
even
on
the
rialto
and
another
went
into
the
details
of
a
murder
which
had
deprived
a
mother
of
her
only
son
and
the
daughter
of
a
patrician
of
her
love
in
this
manner
as
one
after
another
contributed
to
the
list
a
little
group
assembled
on
the
quay
enumerated
no
less
than
lives
which
were
believed
to
have
been
taken
by
the
hand
of
jacopo
without
including
the
vindictive
and
useless
assassination
of
him
whose
funeral
rites
had
just
been
celebrated
happily
perhaps
for
his
peace
of
mind
the
subject
of
all
these
rumors
and
of
the
maledictions
which
they
drew
upon
his
head
knew
nothing
of
either
before
his
judges
he
had
made
no
defence
whatever
firmly
refusing
to
answer
their
interrogatories
ye
know
what
i
have
done
messires
he
said
haughtily
and
what
i
have
not
done
ye
know
as
for
yourselves
look
to
your
own
interests
when
again
in
his
cell
he
demanded
food
and
ate
tranquilly
though
with
moderation
every
instrument
which
could
possibly
be
used
against
his
life
was
then
removed
his
irons
were
finally
and
carefully
examined
and
he
was
left
to
his
thoughts
it
was
in
this
situation
that
the
prisoner
heard
the
approach
of
footsteps
to
his
cell
the
bolts
turned
and
the
door
opened
the
form
of
a
priest
appeared
between
him
and
the
day
the
latter
however
held
a
lamp
which
as
the
cell
was
again
shut
and
secured
he
placed
on
the
low
shelf
that
held
the
jug
and
loaf
of
the
prisoner
jacopo
received
his
visitor
calmly
but
with
the
deep
respect
of
one
who
reverenced
his
body
office
he
arose
crossed
himself
and
advanced
as
far
as
the
chains
permitted
to
do
him
honor
thou
art
welcome
father
he
said
in
cutting
me
off
from
earth
the
council
i
see
does
not
wish
to
cut
me
off
from
god
that
would
exceed
their
power
son
he
who
died
for
them
shed
his
blood
for
thee
if
thou
wilt
not
reject
his
grace
but
heaven
knows
i
say
it
with
reluctance
thou
art
not
to
think
that
one
of
thy
sins
jacopo
can
have
hope
without
deep
and
heartfelt
repentance
father
have
any
the
carmelite
started
for
the
point
of
the
question
and
the
tranquil
tones
of
the
speaker
had
a
strange
effect
in
such
an
interview
thou
art
not
what
i
had
supposed
thee
jacopo
he
answered
thy
mind
is
not
altogether
obscured
in
darkness
and
thy
crimes
have
been
committed
against
the
consciousness
of
their
enormity
i
fear
this
is
true
reverend
monk
thou
must
feel
their
weight
in
the
poignancy
of
grief
in
the
father
anselmo
stopped
for
a
sob
at
that
moment
apprised
them
that
they
were
not
alone
moving
aside
in
a
little
alarm
the
action
discovered
the
figure
of
the
shrinking
gelsomina
who
had
entered
the
cell
favored
by
the
keepers
and
concealed
by
the
robes
of
the
carmelite
jacopo
groaned
when
he
beheld
her
form
and
turning
away
he
leaned
against
the
wall
daughter
why
art
thou
here
and
who
art
thou
demanded
the
monk
is
the
child
of
the
principal
keeper
said
jacopo
perceiving
that
she
was
unable
to
answer
one
known
to
me
in
my
frequent
adventures
in
this
prison
the
eye
of
father
anselmo
wandered
from
one
to
the
other
at
first
its
expression
was
severe
and
then
as
it
saw
each
countenance
in
turn
it
became
less
unkind
until
it
softened
at
the
exhibition
of
their
mutual
agony
this
comes
of
human
passions
he
said
in
a
tone
between
consolation
and
reproof
such
are
ever
the
fruits
of
crime
father
said
jacopo
with
earnestness
i
may
deserve
the
word
but
the
angels
in
heaven
are
scarce
purer
than
this
weeping
girl
i
rejoice
to
hear
it
i
will
believe
thee
unfortunate
man
and
glad
am
i
that
thy
soul
is
relieved
from
the
sin
of
having
corrupted
one
so
youthful
the
bosom
of
the
prisoner
heaved
while
gelsomina
shuddered
why
hast
thou
yielded
to
the
weakness
of
nature
and
entered
the
cell
asked
the
good
carmelite
endeavoring
to
throw
into
his
eye
a
reproof
that
the
pathos
and
kindness
of
his
tones
contradicted
didst
thou
know
the
character
of
the
man
thou
loved
immaculate
maria
exclaimed
the
girl
no
no
no
no
and
now
that
thou
hast
learned
the
truth
surely
thou
art
no
longer
the
victim
of
wayward
fancies
the
gaze
of
gelsomina
was
bewildered
but
anguish
prevailed
over
all
other
expression
she
bowed
her
head
partly
in
shame
but
more
in
sorrow
without
answering
i
know
not
children
what
end
this
interview
can
answer
continued
the
monk
i
am
sent
hither
to
receive
the
last
confession
of
a
bravo
and
surely
one
who
has
so
much
cause
to
condemn
the
deception
he
has
practised
would
not
wish
to
hear
the
details
of
such
a
life
no
no
no
murmured
gelsomina
again
enforcing
her
words
with
a
wild
gesture
of
the
hand
it
is
better
father
that
she
should
believe
me
all
that
her
fancy
can
imagine
as
monstrous
said
jacopo
in
a
thick
voice
she
will
then
learn
to
hate
my
memory
gelsomina
did
not
speak
but
the
negative
gesture
was
repeated
franticly
the
heart
of
the
poor
child
hath
been
sorely
touched
said
the
carmelite
with
concern
we
must
not
treat
so
tender
a
flower
rudely
hearken
to
me
daughter
and
consult
thy
reason
more
than
thy
weakness
question
her
not
father
let
her
curse
me
and
depart
carlo
shrieked
gelsomina
a
long
pause
succeeded
the
monk
perceived
that
human
passion
was
superior
to
his
art
and
that
the
case
must
be
left
to
time
while
the
prisoner
maintained
within
himself
a
struggle
more
fierce
than
any
which
it
had
yet
been
his
fate
to
endure
the
lingering
desires
of
the
world
conquered
and
he
broke
silence
father
he
said
advancing
to
the
length
of
his
chain
and
speaking
both
solemnly
and
with
dignity
i
had
hoped
i
had
prayed
that
this
unhappy
but
innocent
creature
might
have
turned
from
her
own
weakness
with
loathing
when
she
came
to
know
that
the
man
she
loved
was
a
bravo
but
i
did
injustice
to
the
heart
of
woman
tell
me
gelsomina
and
as
thou
valuest
thy
salvation
deceive
me
not
canst
thou
look
at
me
without
horror
gelsomina
trembled
but
she
raised
her
eyes
and
smiled
on
him
as
the
weeping
infant
returns
the
earnest
and
tender
regard
of
its
mother
the
effect
of
that
glance
on
jacopo
was
so
powerful
that
his
sinewy
frame
shook
until
the
wondering
carmelite
heard
the
clanking
of
his
chains
is
enough
he
said
struggling
to
command
himself
gelsomina
thou
shalt
hear
my
confession
thou
hast
long
been
mistress
of
one
great
secret
none
other
shall
be
hid
from
thee
antonio
gasped
the
girl
carlo
carlo
what
had
that
aged
fisherman
done
that
thy
hand
should
seek
his
life
antonio
echoed
the
monk
dost
thou
stand
charged
with
his
death
my
son
it
is
the
crime
for
which
i
am
condemned
to
die
the
carmelite
sank
upon
the
stool
of
the
prisoner
and
sat
motionless
looking
with
an
eye
of
horror
from
the
countenance
of
the
unmoved
jacopo
to
that
of
his
trembling
companion
the
truth
began
to
dawn
upon
him
though
his
mind
was
still
enveloped
in
the
web
of
venetian
mystery
here
is
some
horrible
mistake
he
whispered
i
will
hasten
to
thy
judges
and
undeceive
them
the
prisoner
smiled
calmly
as
he
reached
out
a
hand
to
arrest
the
zealous
movement
of
the
simple
carmelite
be
useless
he
said
it
is
the
pleasure
of
the
three
that
i
should
suffer
for
old
antonio
death
then
wilt
thou
die
unjustly
i
am
a
witness
that
he
fell
by
other
hands
father
shrieked
gelsomina
oh
repeat
the
words
say
that
carlo
could
not
do
the
cruel
deed
of
that
murder
at
least
he
is
innocent
gelsomina
said
jacopo
struggling
to
stretch
forth
his
arms
towards
her
and
yielding
to
a
full
heart
and
of
every
other
a
cry
of
wild
delight
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
girl
who
in
the
next
instant
lay
senseless
on
his
bosom
we
draw
the
veil
before
the
scene
that
followed
near
an
hour
must
pass
before
we
can
again
remove
it
the
cell
then
exhibited
a
group
in
its
centre
over
which
the
lamp
shed
its
feeble
light
marking
the
countenances
of
the
different
personages
with
strong
tints
and
deep
shadows
in
a
manner
to
bring
forth
all
the
force
of
italian
expression
the
carmelite
was
seated
on
the
stool
while
jacopo
and
gelsomina
knelt
beside
him
the
former
of
the
two
last
was
speaking
earnestly
while
his
auditors
caught
each
syllable
that
issued
from
his
lips
as
if
interest
in
his
innocence
were
still
stronger
than
curiosity
i
have
told
you
father
he
continued
that
a
false
accusation
of
having
wronged
the
customs
brought
my
unhappy
parent
under
the
displeasure
and
that
he
was
many
years
an
innocent
inhabitant
of
one
of
these
accursed
cells
while
we
believed
him
in
exile
among
the
islands
at
length
we
succeeded
in
getting
such
proof
before
the
council
as
ought
to
have
satisfied
the
patricians
of
their
own
injustice
i
am
afraid
that
when
men
pretend
that
the
chosen
of
the
earth
exercise
authority
they
are
not
ready
to
admit
their
errors
for
it
would
be
proof
against
the
merit
of
their
system
the
council
delayed
a
weary
time
to
do
us
justice
so
long
that
my
poor
mother
sank
under
her
sufferings
my
sister
a
girl
of
gelsomina
years
followed
her
soon
for
the
only
reason
given
by
the
state
when
pressed
for
proof
was
the
suspicion
that
one
who
sought
her
love
was
guilty
of
the
crime
for
which
my
unhappy
father
perished
and
did
they
refuse
to
repair
their
injustice
exclaimed
the
carmelite
they
could
not
do
it
father
without
publishing
their
fallibility
the
credit
of
certain
great
patricians
was
concerned
and
i
fear
there
is
a
morality
in
these
councils
which
separates
the
deed
of
the
man
from
those
of
the
senators
putting
policy
before
justice
this
may
be
true
son
for
when
a
community
is
grounded
on
false
principles
its
interests
must
of
necessity
be
maintained
by
sophisms
god
will
view
this
act
with
a
different
eye
else
would
the
world
be
hopeless
father
after
years
of
prayers
and
interest
i
was
under
a
solemn
oath
of
secresy
admitted
to
my
cell
there
was
happiness
in
being
able
to
administer
to
his
wants
in
hearing
his
voice
in
kneeling
for
his
blessing
gelsomina
was
then
a
child
approaching
womanhood
i
knew
not
their
motive
though
after
thoughts
left
it
no
secret
and
i
was
permitted
to
see
my
father
through
her
means
when
they
believed
that
i
was
sufficiently
caught
in
their
toils
i
was
led
into
that
fatal
error
which
has
destroyed
my
hopes
and
brought
me
to
this
condition
thou
hast
affirmed
thy
innocence
my
son
innocent
of
shedding
blood
father
but
not
of
lending
myself
to
their
artifices
i
will
not
weary
you
holy
monk
with
the
history
of
the
means
by
which
they
worked
upon
my
nature
i
was
sworn
to
serve
the
state
as
its
secret
agent
for
a
certain
time
the
reward
was
to
be
my
father
freedom
had
they
taken
me
in
the
world
and
in
my
senses
their
arts
would
not
have
triumphed
but
a
daily
witness
of
the
sufferings
of
him
who
had
given
me
life
and
who
was
now
all
that
was
left
me
in
the
world
they
were
too
strong
for
my
weakness
they
whispered
to
me
of
racks
and
wheels
and
i
was
shown
paintings
of
dying
martyrs
that
i
might
understand
the
agony
they
could
inflict
assassinations
were
frequent
and
called
for
the
care
of
the
police
in
short
father
jacopo
hid
his
face
in
the
dress
of
gelsomina
i
consented
to
let
them
circulate
such
tales
as
might
draw
the
eye
of
the
public
on
me
i
need
not
add
that
he
who
lends
himself
to
his
own
infamy
will
soon
attain
his
object
with
what
end
was
this
miserable
falsehood
invented
father
i
was
applied
to
as
a
public
bravo
and
my
reports
in
more
ways
than
one
answered
their
designs
that
i
saved
some
lives
is
at
least
a
consolation
for
the
error
or
crime
into
which
i
fell
i
understand
thee
jacopo
i
have
heard
that
venice
did
not
hesitate
to
use
the
ardent
and
brave
in
this
manner
holy
mark
can
deceit
like
this
be
practised
under
the
sanction
of
thy
blessed
name
father
it
is
and
more
i
had
other
duties
connected
with
the
interests
of
the
republic
and
of
course
i
was
practised
in
their
discharge
the
citizens
marvelled
that
one
like
me
should
go
at
large
while
the
vindictive
and
revengeful
took
the
circumstance
as
a
proof
of
address
when
rumor
grew
too
strong
for
appearances
the
three
took
measures
to
direct
it
to
other
things
and
when
it
grew
too
faint
for
their
wishes
it
was
fanned
in
short
for
three
long
and
bitter
years
did
i
pass
the
life
of
the
damned
sustained
only
by
the
hope
of
liberating
my
father
and
cheered
by
the
love
of
this
innocent
poor
jacopo
thou
art
to
be
pitied
i
will
remember
thee
in
my
prayers
and
thou
gelsomina
the
keeper
daughter
did
not
answer
her
ears
had
drunk
in
each
syllable
that
fell
from
his
lips
and
now
that
the
whole
truth
began
to
dawn
on
her
mind
there
was
a
bright
radiance
in
her
eye
that
appeared
almost
supernatural
to
those
who
witnessed
it
if
i
have
failed
in
convincing
thee
gelsomina
continued
jacopo
that
i
am
not
the
wretch
i
seemed
would
that
i
had
been
dumb
she
stretched
a
hand
towards
him
and
dropping
her
head
on
his
bosom
wept
i
see
all
thy
temptations
poor
carlo
she
said
softly
i
know
how
strong
was
thy
love
for
thy
father
dost
thou
forgive
me
dearest
gelsomina
for
the
deception
on
thy
innocence
there
was
no
deception
i
believed
thee
a
son
ready
to
die
for
his
father
and
i
find
thee
what
i
thought
thee
the
good
carmelite
regarded
this
scene
with
eyes
of
interest
and
indulgence
tears
wetted
his
cheeks
thy
affection
for
each
other
children
he
said
is
such
as
angels
might
indulge
has
thy
intercourse
been
of
long
date
it
has
lasted
years
father
and
thou
daughter
hast
been
with
jacopo
in
the
cell
of
his
parent
i
was
his
constant
guide
on
these
holy
errands
father
the
monk
mused
deeply
after
a
silence
of
several
minutes
he
proceeded
to
the
duties
of
his
holy
office
receiving
the
spiritual
confession
of
the
prisoner
he
gave
the
absolution
with
a
fervor
which
proved
how
deeply
his
sympathies
were
enlisted
in
behalf
of
the
youthful
pair
this
duty
done
he
gave
gelsomina
his
hand
and
there
was
a
mild
confidence
in
his
countenance
as
he
took
leave
of
jacopo
we
quit
thee
he
said
but
be
of
heart
son
i
can
not
think
that
even
venice
will
be
deaf
to
a
tale
like
thine
trust
first
to
thy
god
and
believe
that
neither
this
faithful
girl
nor
i
will
abandon
thee
without
an
effort
jacopo
received
this
assurance
like
one
accustomed
to
exist
in
extreme
jeopardy
the
smile
which
accompanied
his
own
adieux
had
in
it
as
much
of
incredulity
as
of
melancholy
it
was
however
full
of
the
joy
of
a
lightened
heart

the
carmelite
and
gelsomina
found
the
keepers
in
waiting
and
when
they
quitted
the
cell
its
door
was
secured
for
the
night
as
they
had
no
further
concerns
with
the
jailors
they
passed
on
unquestioned
but
when
the
end
of
the
corridor
which
led
towards
the
apartments
of
the
keeper
was
reached
the
monk
stopped
art
thou
equal
to
a
great
effort
in
order
that
the
innocent
shall
not
die
he
suddenly
asked
though
with
a
solemnity
that
denoted
the
influence
of
a
high
and
absorbing
motive
father
i
would
know
if
thy
love
for
the
youth
can
sustain
thee
in
a
trying
scene
for
without
this
effort
he
will
surely
perish
i
would
die
to
save
jacopo

pang

thou

diffidence
of
thy
years

condition
stand
and
speak
fearlessly
in
the
presence
of
the
great
and
dreaded
reverend
carmelite
i
speak
daily
without
fear
though
not
without
awe
to
one
more
to
be
dreaded
than
any
in
venice
the
monk
looked
in
admiration
at
the
gentle
being
whose
countenance
was
glowing
with
the
mild
resolution
of
innocence
and
affection
and
he
motioned
for
her
to
follow
we
will
go
then
before
the
proudest
and
the
most
fearful
of
earth
should
there
be
occasion
he
resumed
we
will
do
our
duty
to
both
parties
to
the
oppressor
and
the
oppressed
that
the
sin
of
omission
lie
not
on
our
souls
father
anselmo
without
further
explanation
led
the
obedient
girl
into
that
part
of
the
palace
which
was
known
to
be
appropriated
to
the
private
uses
of
the
titular
head
of
the
republic
the
jealousy
of
the
venetian
patricians
on
the
subject
of
their
doge
is
matter
of
history
he
was
by
situation
a
puppet
in
the
hands
of
the
nobles
who
only
tolerated
his
existence
because
the
theory
of
their
government
required
a
seeming
agent
in
the
imposing
ceremonies
that
formed
part
of
their
specious
system
and
in
their
intercourse
with
other
states
he
dwelt
in
his
palace
like
the
in
the
hive
pampered
and
honored
to
the
eye
but
in
truth
devoted
to
the
objects
of
those
who
alone
possess
the
power
to
injure
and
perhaps
we
might
add
like
the
insect
named
known
for
consuming
more
than
a
usual
portion
of
the
fruits
of
the
common
industry
father
anselmo
was
indebted
to
his
own
decision
and
to
the
confidence
of
his
manner
for
reaching
the
private
apartments
of
a
prince
thus
secluded
and
watched
he
was
permitted
to
pass
by
various
sentinels
who
imagined
from
his
holy
calling
and
calm
step
that
he
was
some
friar
employed
in
his
usual
and
privileged
office
by
this
easy
quiet
method
did
the
carmelite
and
his
companion
penetrate
to
the
very
of
the
sovereign
a
spot
that
thousands
had
been
defeated
in
attempting
to
reach
by
means
more
elaborate
there
were
merely
two
or
three
drowsy
inferior
officers
of
the
household
in
waiting
one
arose
quickly
at
the
unexpected
appearance
of
these
unknown
visitors
expressing
by
the
surprise
and
the
confusion
of
his
eye
the
wonder
into
which
he
was
thrown
by
so
guests
his
highness
waits
for
us
i
fear
simply
observed
father
anselmo
who
had
known
how
to
quiet
his
concern
in
a
look
of
passive
courtesy
santa
maria
holy
father
you
should
know
best
but
we
will
not
lose
more
time
in
idle
words
son
when
there
has
already
been
this
delay
show
us
to
the
closet
of
his
highness
it
is
forbidden
to
usher
any
unannounced
into
the
presence
thou
seest
this
is
not
an
ordinary
visit
go
inform
the
doge
that
the
carmelite
he
expects
and
the
youthful
maiden
in
whom
his
princely
bosom
feels
so
parental
an
interest
await
his
pleasure
his
highness
has
then
commanded
tell
him
moreover
that
time
presses
for
the
hour
is
near
when
innocence
is
condemned
to
suffer
the
usher
was
deceived
by
the
gravity
and
assurance
of
the
monk
he
hesitated
and
then
throwing
open
a
door
he
showed
the
visitors
into
an
inner
room
where
he
requested
them
to
await
his
return
after
this
he
went
on
the
desired
commission
to
the
closet
of
his
master
it
has
already
been
shown
that
the
reigning
doge
if
such
a
title
can
be
used
of
a
prince
who
was
merely
a
tool
of
the
aristocracy
was
a
man
advanced
in
years
he
had
thrown
aside
the
cares
of
the
day
and
in
the
retirement
of
his
privacy
was
endeavoring
to
indulge
those
human
sympathies
that
had
so
little
play
in
the
ordinary
duties
of
his
factitious
condition
by
holding
intercourse
with
the
mind
of
one
of
the
classics
of
his
country
his
state
was
laid
aside
for
lighter
ease
and
personal
freedom
the
monk
could
not
have
chosen
a
happier
moment
for
his
object
since
the
man
was
undefended
by
the
usual
appliances
of
his
rank
and
he
was
softened
by
communion
with
one
who
had
known
how
to
mould
and
temper
the
feelings
of
his
readers
at
will
so
entire
was
the
abstraction
of
the
doge
at
the
moment
that
the
usher
entered
unheeded
and
had
stood
in
respectful
attention
to
his
sovereign
pleasure
near
a
minute
before
he
was
seen
what
thou
marco
demanded
the
prince
when
his
eye
rose
from
the
page
signore
returned
the
officer
using
the
familiar
manner
in
which
those
nearest
to
the
persons
of
princes
are
permitted
to
indulge
here
are
the
reverend
carmelite
and
the
young
girl
in
waiting
how
sayest
thou
a
carmelite
and
a
girl
signore
the
same
those
whom
your
highness
expects
what
bold
pretence
is
this
signore
i
do
but
repeat
the
words
of
the
monk
his
highness
said
the
father
the
carmelite
he
wishes
to
see
and
the
young
girl
in
whose
happiness
his
princely
bosom
feels
so
parental
an
interest
await
his
pleasure
there
passed
a
glow
in
which
indignation
was
brighter
than
shame
over
the
wasted
cheek
of
the
old
prince
and
his
eye
kindled
and
this
to
me
even
in
my
palace
pardon
signore
this
is
no
shameless
priest
like
so
many
that
disgrace
the
tonsure
both
monk
and
girl
have
innocent
and
harmless
looks
and
i
do
suspect
your
highness
may
have
forgotten
the
bright
spots
disappeared
from
the
prince
cheeks
and
his
eye
regained
its
paternal
expression
but
age
and
experience
in
his
delicate
duties
had
taught
the
doge
of
venice
caution
he
well
knew
that
memory
had
not
failed
him
and
he
at
once
saw
that
a
hidden
meaning
lay
concealed
beneath
an
application
so
unusual
there
might
be
a
device
of
his
enemies
who
were
numerous
and
active
or
in
truth
there
might
be
some
justifiable
motive
to
warrant
the
applicant
in
resorting
to
a
measure
so
hardy
did
the
carmelite
say
more
good
marco
he
asked
after
deep
reflection
signore
he
said
there
was
great
urgency
as
the
hour
was
near
when
the
innocent
might
suffer
i
doubt
not
that
he
comes
with
a
petition
in
behalf
of
some
young
indiscreet
for
there
are
said
to
be
several
young
nobles
arrested
for
their
follies
in
the
carnival
the
female
may
be
a
sister
disguised
bid
one
of
thy
companions
come
hither
and
when
i
touch
my
bell
do
thou
usher
these
visitors
to
my
presence
the
attendant
withdrew
taking
care
to
pass
into
the
antechamber
by
doors
that
rendered
it
unnecessary
to
show
himself
too
soon
to
those
who
expected
his
return
the
second
usher
quickly
made
his
appearance
and
was
immediately
dispatched
in
quest
of
one
of
the
three
who
was
occupied
with
important
papers
in
an
adjoining
closet
the
senator
was
not
slow
to
obey
the
summons
for
he
appeared
there
as
a
friend
of
the
prince
having
been
admitted
publicly
and
with
the
customary
honors
here
are
visitors
of
an
unusual
character
signore
said
the
doge
rising
to
receive
him
whom
he
had
summoned
in
precaution
to
himself
and
i
would
have
a
witness
of
their
requests
your
highness
does
well
to
make
us
of
the
senate
share
your
labors
though
if
any
mistaken
opinion
of
the
necessity
has
led
you
to
conceive
it
important
to
call
a
councillor
each
time
a
guest
enters
the
palace
it
is
well
signore
mildly
interrupted
the
prince
touching
the
bell
i
hope
my
importunity
has
not
deranged
you
but
here
come
those
i
expect
father
anselmo
and
gelsomina
entered
the
closet
together
the
first
glance
convinced
the
doge
that
he
received
strangers
he
exchanged
looks
with
the
member
of
the
secret
council
and
each
saw
in
the
other
eye
that
the
surprise
was
mutual
when
fairly
in
the
presence
the
carmelite
threw
back
his
cowl
entirely
exposing
the
whole
of
his
ascetic
features
while
gelsomina
awed
by
the
rank
of
him
who
received
them
shrank
abashed
partly
concealed
by
his
robes
what
means
this
visit
demanded
the
prince
whose
finger
pointed
to
the
shrinking
form
of
the
girl
while
his
eye
rested
steadily
on
that
of
the
monk
and
that
unusual
companion
neither
the
hour
nor
the
mode
is
customary
father
anselmo
stood
before
the
venetian
sovereign
for
the
first
time
accustomed
like
all
of
that
region
and
more
especially
in
that
age
to
calculate
his
chances
of
success
warily
before
venturing
to
disburden
his
mind
the
monk
fastened
a
penetrating
look
on
his
interrogator
illustrious
prince
he
said
we
come
petitioners
for
justice
they
who
are
thus
commissioned
had
need
be
bold
lest
they
do
their
own
character
and
their
righteous
office
discredit
justice
is
the
glory
of
mark
and
the
happiness
of
his
subjects
thy
course
father
is
not
according
to
established
rules
and
wholesome
restraints
but
it
may
have
its
apology
name
thy
errand
there
is
one
in
the
cells
condemned
of
the
public
tribunals
and
he
must
die
with
the
return
of
day
unless
your
princely
authority
interfere
to
save
him
one
condemned
of
the
tribunals
may
merit
his
fate
i
am
the
ghostly
adviser
of
the
unhappy
youth
and
in
the
execution
of
my
sacred
office
i
have
learned
that
he
is
innocent
didst
thou
say
condemned
of
the
common
sentenced
to
die
highness
by
a
decree
of
the
criminal
tribunals
the
prince
appeared
relieved
so
long
as
the
affair
had
been
public
there
was
at
least
reason
to
believe
he
might
indulge
his
love
of
the
species
by
listening
further
without
offence
to
the
tortuous
policy
of
the
state
glancing
his
eye
at
the
motionless
inquisitor
as
if
to
seek
approbation
he
advanced
a
step
nearer
to
the
carmelite
with
increasing
interest
in
the
application
by
what
authority
reverend
priest
dost
thou
impeach
the
decision
of
the
judges
he
demanded
signore
as
i
have
just
said
in
virtue
of
knowledge
gained
in
the
exercise
of
my
holy
office
he
has
laid
bare
his
soul
to
me
as
one
whose
feet
were
in
the
grave
and
though
offending
like
all
born
of
woman
towards
his
god
he
is
guiltless
as
respects
the
state
thinkest
thou
father
that
the
law
would
ever
reach
its
victim
were
we
to
listen
only
to
i
am
old
monk
and
have
long
worn
that
troublesome
cap
pointing
to
the
horned
bonnet
which
lay
near
his
hand
the
symbol
of
his
state
and
in
my
day
i
do
not
recall
the
criminal
that
has
not
fancied
himself
the
victim
of
untoward
circumstances
that
men
apply
this
treacherous
solace
to
their
consciences
one
of
my
vocation
has
not
to
learn
our
chief
task
is
to
show
the
delusion
of
those
who
while
condemning
their
own
sins
by
words
of
confession
and
make
a
merit
of
humility
but
doge
of
venice
there
is
still
a
virtue
in
the
sacred
rite
i
have
this
evening
been
required
to
perform
which
can
overcome
the
mounting
of
the
most
exalted
spirit
many
attempt
to
deceive
themselves
at
the
confessional
while
by
the
power
of
god
few
succeed
praised
be
the
blessed
mother
and
the
incarnate
son
that
it
is
so
returned
the
prince
struck
by
the
mild
faith
of
the
monk
and
crossing
himself
reverently
father
thou
hast
forgotten
to
name
the
condemned
it
is
a
certain
jacopo
frontoni
a
reputed
bravo
the
start
the
changing
color
and
the
glance
of
the
prince
of
venice
were
full
of
natural
surprise
callest
thou
the
bloodiest
stiletto
that
ever
disgraced
the
city
the
weapon
of
a
reputed
bravo
the
arts
of
the
monster
have
prevailed
over
thy
experience
monk
the
true
confession
of
such
a
wretch
would
be
but
a
history
of
bloody
and
revolting
crimes
i
entered
his
cell
with
this
opinion
but
i
left
it
convinced
that
the
public
sentiment
has
done
him
wrong
if
your
highness
will
deign
hear
his
tale
you
will
think
him
a
fit
subject
for
your
pity
rather
than
for
punishment
of
all
the
criminals
of
my
reign
this
is
the
last
in
whose
favor
i
could
have
imagined
there
was
aught
to
be
said
speak
freely
carmelite
for
curiosity
is
as
strong
as
wonder
so
truly
did
the
doge
give
utterance
to
his
feelings
that
he
momentarily
forgot
the
presence
of
the
inquisitor
whose
countenance
might
have
shown
him
that
the
subject
was
getting
to
be
grave
the
monk
ejaculated
a
thanksgiving
for
it
was
not
always
easy
in
that
city
of
mystery
to
bring
truth
to
the
ears
of
the
great
when
men
live
under
a
system
of
duplicity
more
or
less
of
the
quality
gets
interwoven
with
the
habits
of
the
most
ingenuous
although
they
may
remain
themselves
unconscious
of
the
taint
thus
father
anselmo
as
he
proceeded
with
the
desired
explanation
touched
more
tenderly
on
the
practices
of
the
state
and
used
more
of
reserve
in
alluding
to
those
usages
and
opinions
which
one
of
his
holy
calling
and
honest
nature
under
other
circumstances
would
have
fearlessly
condemned
it
may
not
be
known
to
one
of
your
high
condition
sovereign
prince
resumed
the
carmelite
that
an
humble
but
laborious
mechanic
of
this
city
a
certain
francesco
frontoni
was
long
since
condemned
for
frauds
against
the
republic
revenue
this
is
a
crime
mark
never
fails
to
visit
with
his
heavy
displeasure
for
when
men
place
the
goods
of
the
world
before
all
other
considerations
they
mistake
the
objects
which
have
brought
them
together
in
social
union
father
thou
wert
speaking
of
a
certain
francesco
frontoni
highness
such
was
his
name
the
unhappy
man
had
taken
into
his
confidence
and
friendship
one
who
pretending
to
his
daughter
love
might
appear
to
be
the
master
of
his
secrets
when
this
false
suitor
stood
on
the
verge
of
detection
for
offences
against
the
customs
he
laid
a
snare
of
deception
which
while
he
was
permitted
to
escape
drew
the
anger
of
the
state
on
his
too
confiding
friend
francesco
was
condemned
to
the
cells
until
he
might
reveal
facts
which
never
had
an
existence
this
is
a
hard
fate
reverend
friar
could
it
be
but
proved
is
the
evil
of
secresy
and
intrigue
great
doge
in
managing
the
common
interests
hast
thou
more
of
this
francesco
monk
his
history
is
short
signore
for
at
the
age
when
most
men
are
active
in
looking
to
their
welfare
he
was
pining
in
a
prison
i
remember
to
have
heard
of
some
such
accusation
but
it
occurred
in
the
reign
of
the
last
doge
did
it
not
father
and
he
has
endured
to
near
the
close
of
the
reign
of
this
highness
how
the
senate
when
apprised
of
the
error
of
its
judgment
was
not
slow
to
repair
the
wrong
the
monk
regarded
the
prince
earnestly
as
if
he
would
make
certain
whether
the
surprise
he
witnessed
was
not
a
piece
of
consummate
acting
he
felt
convinced
that
the
affair
was
one
of
that
class
of
acts
which
however
oppressive
unjust
and
destructive
of
personal
happiness
had
not
sufficient
importance
to
come
before
them
who
govern
under
systems
which
care
more
for
their
own
preservation
than
for
the
good
of
the
ruled
signor
doge
he
said
the
state
is
discreet
in
matters
that
touch
its
own
reputation
there
are
reasons
that
i
shall
not
presume
to
examine
why
the
cell
of
poor
francesco
was
kept
closed
long
after
the
death
and
confession
of
his
accuser
left
his
innocence
beyond
dispute
the
prince
mused
and
then
he
bethought
him
to
consult
the
countenance
of
his
companion
the
marble
of
the
pilaster
against
which
he
leaned
was
not
more
cold
and
unmoved
than
the
face
of
the
inquisitor
the
man
had
learned
to
smother
every
natural
impulse
in
the
assumed
and
factitious
duties
of
his
office
and
what
has
this
case
of
francesco
to
do
with
the
execution
of
the
bravo
demanded
the
doge
after
a
pause
in
which
he
had
in
vain
struggled
to
assume
the
indifference
of
his
counsellor
that
i
shall
leave
this
daughter
to
explain
stand
forth
child
and
relate
what
you
know
remembering
if
you
speak
before
the
prince
of
venice
that
you
also
speak
before
the
king
of
heaven
gelsomina
trembled
for
one
of
her
habits
however
supported
by
her
motives
could
not
overcome
a
nature
so
retiring
without
a
struggle
but
faithful
to
her
promise
and
sustained
by
her
affection
for
the
condemned
she
advanced
a
step
and
stood
no
longer
concealed
by
the
robes
of
the
carmelite
thou
art
the
daughter
of
the
asked
the
prince
mildly
though
surprise
was
strongly
painted
in
his
eye
highness
we
are
poor
and
we
are
unfortunate
we
serve
the
state
for
bread
ye
serve
a
noble
master
child
dost
thou
know
aught
of
this
bravo
dread
sovereign
they
that
call
him
thus
know
not
his
heart
one
more
true
to
his
friends
more
faithful
to
his
word
or
more
suppliant
with
the
saints
than
jacopo
frontoni
is
not
in
venice
this
is
a
character
which
art
might
appropriate
even
to
a
bravo
but
we
waste
the
moments
what
have
these
frontoni
in
common
highness
they
are
father
and
son
when
jacopo
came
to
be
of
an
age
to
understand
the
misfortunes
of
his
family
he
wearied
the
senators
with
applications
in
his
father
behalf
until
they
commanded
the
door
of
the
cell
to
be
secretly
opened
to
a
child
so
pious
i
well
know
great
prince
that
they
who
rule
can
not
have
eyes
else
could
this
wrong
never
have
happened
but
francesco
wasted
years
in
cells
chill
and
damp
in
winter
and
scorching
in
summer
before
the
falsehood
of
the
accusation
was
known
then
as
some
relief
to
sufferings
so
little
merited
jacopo
was
admitted
with
what
object
girl
highness
was
it
not
in
pity
they
promised
too
that
in
good
time
the
service
of
the
son
should
buy
the
father
liberty
the
patricians
were
slow
to
be
convinced
and
they
made
terms
with
poor
jacopo
who
agreed
to
undergo
a
hard
service
that
his
father
might
breathe
free
air
before
he
died
thou
dealest
in
enigmas
i
am
little
used
great
doge
to
speak
in
such
a
presence
or
on
such
subjects
but
this
i
know
that
for
three
weary
years
hath
jacopo
been
admitted
to
his
father
cell
and
that
those
up
above
consented
to
the
visits
else
would
my
father
have
denied
them
i
was
his
companion
in
the
holy
act
and
will
call
the
blessed
maria
and
the
saints
girl
didst
thou
know
him
for
a
bravo
oh
highness
no
to
me
he
seemed
a
dutiful
child
fearing
god
and
honoring
his
parent
i
hope
never
to
feel
another
pang
like
that
which
chilled
my
heart
when
they
said
he
i
had
known
as
the
kind
carlo
was
hunted
in
venice
as
the
abhorred
jacopo
but
it
is
passed
the
mother
of
god
be
praised
thou
art
betrothed
to
this
condemned
man
the
color
did
not
deepen
on
the
cheek
of
gelsomina
at
this
abrupt
question
for
the
tie
between
her
and
jacopo
had
become
too
sacred
for
the
ordinary
weaknesses
of
her
sex
highness
yes
we
were
to
be
married
should
it
have
pleased
god
and
those
great
senators
who
have
so
much
influence
over
the
happiness
of
the
poor
to
permit
it
and
thou
art
still
willing
knowing
the
man
to
pledge
thy
vows
to
one
like
jacopo
it
is
because
i
do
know
him
to
be
as
he
is
that
i
most
reverence
him
great
doge
he
has
sold
his
time
and
his
good
name
to
the
state
in
order
to
save
his
imprisoned
father
and
in
that
i
see
nothing
to

loves
this
affair
needs
explanation
carmelite
the
girl
has
a
heated
fancy
and
she
renders
that
obscure
she
should
explain
illustrious
prince
she
would
say
that
the
republic
was
content
to
grant
the
son
the
indulgence
of
visiting
the
captive
with
some
encouragement
of
his
release
on
condition
that
the
youth
might
serve
the
police
by
bearing
a
bravo
reputation
and
for
this
incredible
tale
father
you
have
the
word
of
a
condemned
criminal
with
the
near
view
of
death
before
his
eyes
there
are
means
of
rendering
truth
evident
familiar
to
those
who
are
often
near
the
dying
penitents
that
are
unknown
to
those
of
the
world
in
any
case
signore
the
matter
is
worthy
of
investigation
in
that
thou
art
right
is
the
hour
named
for
the
execution
with
the
morning
light
prince
and
the
father
is
dead
a
prisoner
carmelite
a
prisoner
prince
of
venice
there
was
a
pause
hast
thou
heard
of
the
death
of
one
named
antonio
signore
yes
by
the
sacred
nature
of
my
holy
office
do
i
affirm
that
of
this
crime
is
jacopo
innocent
i
shrived
the
fisherman
the
doge
turned
away
for
the
truth
began
to
dawn
upon
him
and
the
flush
which
glowed
on
his
aged
cheek
contained
a
confession
that
might
not
be
observed
by
every
eye
he
sought
the
glance
of
his
companion
but
his
own
expression
of
human
feeling
was
met
by
the
disciplined
features
of
the
other
as
light
is
coldly
repelled
from
polished
stone
highness
added
a
tremulous
voice
what
thou
child
there
is
a
god
for
the
republic
as
well
as
for
the
gondolier
your
highness
will
turn
this
great
crime
from
venice
thou
art
of
plain
speech
girl
the
danger
of
carlo
has
made
me
bold
you
are
much
beloved
by
the
people
and
none
speak
of
you
that
they
do
not
speak
of
your
goodness
and
of
your
desire
to
serve
the
poor
you
are
the
root
of
a
rich
and
happy
family
and
you
will
not
nay
you
can
not
if
you
would
think
it
a
crime
for
a
son
to
devote
all
to
a
father
you
are
our
father
and
we
have
a
right
to
come
to
you
even
for
mercy
but
highness
i
ask
only
for
justice
justice
is
the
motto
of
venice
they
who
live
in
the
high
favor
of
providence
do
not
always
know
what
the
unhappy
undergo
it
has
pleased
god
to
afflict
my
own
poor
mother
who
has
griefs
that
but
for
her
patience
and
christian
faith
would
have
been
hard
to
bear
the
little
care
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
show
first
caught
jacopo
eye
for
his
heart
was
then
full
of
the
duty
of
the
child
would
your
highness
consent
to
see
poor
carlo
or
to
command
him
to
be
brought
hither
his
simple
tale
would
give
the
lie
to
every
foul
slander
they
have
dared
to
say
against
him
it
is
unnecessary
it
is
unnecessary
thy
faith
in
his
innocence
girl
is
more
eloquent
than
any
words
of
his
can
prove
a
gleam
of
joy
irradiated
the
face
of
gelsomina
who
turned
eagerly
to
the
listening
monk
as
she
continued
his
highness
listens
she
said
and
we
shall
prevail
father
they
menace
in
venice
and
alarm
the
timid
but
they
will
never
do
the
deed
we
feared
is
not
the
god
of
jacopo
my
god
and
your
god
the
god
of
the
senate
and
of
the
doge
of
the
council
and
of
the
republic
i
would
the
secret
members
of
the
three
could
have
seen
poor
jacopo
as
i
have
seen
him
coming
from
his
toil
weary
with
labor
and
with
delay
enter
the
winter
or
the
summer
cell
chilling
or
scorching
as
the
season
might
be
struggling
to
be
cheerful
that
the
falsely
accused
might
not
feel
a
greater
weight
of
misery
oh
venerable
and
kind
prince
you
little
know
the
burden
that
the
feeble
are
often
made
to
carry
for
to
you
life
has
been
sunshine
but
there
are
millions
who
are
condemned
to
do
that
they
loathe
that
they
may
not
do
that
they
dread
child
thou
me
nothing
new
except
in
convincing
you
highness
that
jacopo
is
not
the
monster
they
would
have
him
i
do
not
know
the
secret
reasons
of
the
councils
for
wishing
the
youth
to
lend
himself
to
a
deception
that
had
nigh
proved
so
fatal
but
all
is
explained
we
have
naught
now
to
fear
come
father
we
will
leave
the
good
and
just
doge
to
go
to
rest
as
suits
his
years
and
we
will
return
to
gladden
the
heart
of
jacopo
with
our
success
and
thank
the
blessed
maria
for
her
favor
stay
exclaimed
the
old
man
is
this
true
that
thou
tellest
me
girl
father
can
it
be
so
signore
i
have
said
all
that
truth
and
my
conscience
have
prompted
the
prince
seemed
bewildered
turning
his
look
from
the
motionless
girl
to
the
equally
immovable
member
of
the
three
come
hither
child
he
said
his
voice
trembling
as
he
spoke
come
hither
that
i
may
bless
thee
gelsomina
sprang
forward
and
knelt
at
the
feet
of
her
sovereign
father
anselmo
never
uttered
a
clearer
or
more
fervent
benediction
than
that
which
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
prince
of
venice
he
raised
the
daughter
of
the
and
motioned
for
both
his
visitors
to
withdraw
gelsomina
willingly
complied
for
her
heart
was
already
in
the
cell
of
jacopo
in
the
eagerness
to
communicate
her
success
but
the
carmelite
lingered
to
cast
a
look
behind
like
one
better
acquainted
with
the
effects
of
worldly
policy
when
connected
with
the
interests
of
those
who
pervert
governments
to
the
advantage
of
the
privileged
as
he
passed
through
the
door
however
he
felt
his
hopes
revive
for
he
saw
the
aged
prince
unable
any
longer
to
suppress
his
feelings
hastening
towards
his
still
silent
companion
with
both
hands
extended
eyes
moistening
with
tears
and
a
look
that
betrayed
the
emotions
of
one
anxious
to
find
relief
in
human
sympathies

our
knell

that
of
on
marino
faliero
another
morning
called
the
venetians
to
their
affairs
agents
of
the
police
had
been
active
in
preparing
the
public
mind
and
as
the
sun
rose
above
the
narrow
sea
the
squares
began
to
fill
there
were
present
the
curious
citizen
in
his
cloak
and
cap
laborers
in
wondering
awe
the
circumspect
hebrew
in
his
gaberdine
and
beard
masked
gentlemen
and
many
an
attentive
stranger
from
among
the
thousands
who
still
frequented
that
declining
mart
it
was
rumored
that
an
act
of
retributive
justice
was
about
to
take
place
for
the
peace
of
the
town
and
the
protection
of
the
citizen
in
short
curiosity
idleness
and
revenge
with
all
the
usual
train
of
human
feelings
had
drawn
together
a
multitude
eager
to
witness
the
agonies
of
a
the
dalmatians
were
drawn
up
near
the
sea
in
a
manner
to
inclose
the
two
granite
columns
of
the
piazzetta
their
grave
and
disciplined
faces
fronted
inwards
towards
the
african
pillars
those
well
known
landmarks
of
death
a
few
grim
warriors
of
higher
rank
paced
the
flags
before
the
troops
while
a
dense
crowd
filled
the
exterior
space
by
special
favor
more
than
a
hundred
fishermen
were
grouped
within
the
armed
men
witnesses
that
their
class
had
revenge
between
the
lofty
pedestals
of
theodore
and
the
winged
lion
lay
the
block
and
the
axe
the
basket
and
the
the
usual
accompaniments
of
justice
in
that
day
by
their
side
stood
the
executioner
at
length
a
movement
in
the
living
mass
drew
every
eye
towards
the
gate
of
the
palace
a
murmur
arose
the
multitude
wavered
and
a
small
body
of
the
sbirri
came
into
view
their
steps
were
swift
like
the
march
of
destiny
the
dalmatians
opened
to
receive
these
ministers
of
fate
into
their
bosom
and
closing
their
ranks
again
appeared
to
preclude
the
world
with
its
hopes
from
the
condemned
on
reaching
the
block
between
the
columns
the
sbirri
fell
off
in
files
waiting
at
a
little
distance
while
jacopo
was
left
before
the
engines
of
death
attended
by
his
ghostly
counsellor
the
carmelite
the
action
left
them
open
to
the
gaze
of
the
throng
father
anselmo
was
in
the
usual
attire
of
a
friar
of
his
order
the
cowl
of
the
holy
man
was
thrown
back
exposing
his
mortified
lineaments
and
his
eye
to
those
around
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
that
of
bewildered
uncertainty
relieved
by
frequent
but
fitful
glimmerings
of
hope
though
his
lips
were
constant
in
prayer
his
looks
wandered
by
an
irrepressible
impulse
from
one
window
of
the
doge
palace
to
another
he
took
his
station
near
the
condemned
however
and
thrice
crossed
himself
fervently
jacopo
had
tranquilly
placed
his
person
before
the
block
his
head
was
bare
his
cheek
colorless
his
throat
and
neck
uncovered
from
the
shoulders
his
body
in
its
linen
and
the
rest
of
his
form
was
clad
in
the
ordinary
dress
of
a
gondolier
he
kneeled
with
his
face
bowed
to
the
block
repeated
a
prayer
and
rising
he
faced
the
multitude
with
dignity
and
composure
as
his
eye
moved
slowly
over
the
array
of
human
countenances
by
which
he
was
environed
a
hectic
glowed
on
his
features
for
not
one
of
them
all
betrayed
sympathy
in
his
sufferings
his
breast
heaved
and
those
nearest
to
his
person
thought
the
of
the
miserable
man
was
about
to
fail
him
the
result
disappointed
expectation
there
was
a
shudder
and
the
limbs
settled
into
repose
thou
hast
looked
in
vain
among
the
multitude
for
a
friendly
eye
said
the
carmelite
whose
attention
had
been
drawn
to
the
convulsive
movement
none
here
have
pity
for
an
assassin
remember
thy
redeemer
son
he
suffered
ignominy
and
death
for
a
race
that
denied
his
godhead
and
derided
his
sorrows
jacopo
crossed
himself
and
bowed
his
head
in
reverence
hast
thou
more
prayers
to
repeat
father
demanded
the
chief
of
the
sbirri
he
who
was
particularly
charged
with
the
duty
of
the
hour
though
the
illustrious
councils
are
so
sure
in
justice
they
are
merciful
to
the
souls
of
sinners
are
thy
orders
peremptory
asked
the
monk
unconsciously
fixing
his
eye
again
on
the
windows
of
the
palace
is
it
certain
that
the
prisoner
is
to
die
the
officer
smiled
at
the
simplicity
of
the
question
but
with
the
apathy
of
one
too
much
familiarized
with
human
suffering
to
admit
of
compassion
do
any
doubt
it
he
rejoined
it
is
the
lot
of
man
reverend
monk
and
more
especially
is
it
the
lot
of
those
on
whom
the
judgment
of
mark
has
alighted
it
were
better
that
your
penitent
looked
to
his
soul
surely
thou
hast
thy
private
and
express
commands
they
have
named
a
minute
when
this
bloody
work
is
to
be
performed
holy
carmelite
i
have
the
time
will
not
be
weary
and
you
will
do
well
to
make
the
most
of
it
unless
you
have
faith
already
in
the
prisoner
condition
as
he
spoke
the
officer
threw
a
glance
at
the
dial
of
the
square
and
walked
coolly
away
the
action
left
the
priest
and
the
prisoner
again
alone
between
the
columns
it
was
evident
that
the
former
could
not
yet
believe
in
the
reality
of
the
execution
hast
thou
no
hope
jacopo
he
asked
carmelite
in
my
god
they
can
not
commit
this
wrong
i
shrived
antonio
i
witnessed
his
fate
and
the
prince
knows
it
what
is
a
prince
and
his
justice
where
the
selfishness
of
a
few
rules
father
thou
art
new
in
the
senate
service
i
shall
not
presume
to
say
that
god
will
blast
those
who
do
this
deed
for
we
can
not
trace
the
mysteries
of
his
wisdom
this
life
and
all
this
world
can
offer
are
but
specks
in
his
omniscient
eye
and
what
to
us
seems
evil
may
be
pregnant
with
hast
thou
faith
in
thy
redeemer
jacopo
the
prisoner
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
smiled
with
the
calm
assurance
that
none
but
those
who
are
thus
sustained
can
feel
we
will
again
pray
my
son
the
carmelite
and
jacopo
kneeled
side
by
side
the
latter
bowing
his
head
to
the
block
while
the
monk
uttered
a
final
appeal
to
the
mercy
of
the
deity
the
former
arose
but
the
latter
continued
in
the
suppliant
attitude
the
monk
was
so
full
of
holy
thoughts
that
forgetting
his
former
wishes
he
was
nearly
content
the
prisoner
should
pass
into
the
fruition
of
that
hope
which
elevated
his
own
mind
the
officer
and
executioner
drew
near
the
former
touching
the
arm
of
father
anselmo
and
pointing
towards
the
distant
dial
the
moment
is
near
he
whispered
more
from
habit
than
in
any
tenderness
to
the
prisoner
the
carmelite
turned
instinctively
towards
the
palace
forgetting
in
the
sudden
impulse
all
but
his
sense
of
earthly
justice
there
were
forms
at
the
windows
and
he
fancied
a
signal
to
stay
the
impending
blow
was
about
to
be
given
hold
he
exclaimed
for
the
love
of
maria
of
most
pure
memory
be
not
too
hasty
the
exclamation
was
repeated
by
a
shrill
female
voice
and
then
gelsomina
eluding
every
effort
to
arrest
her
rushed
through
the
dalmatians
and
reached
the
group
between
the
granite
columns
wonder
and
curiosity
agitated
the
multitude
and
a
deep
murmur
ran
through
the
square
is
a
maniac
cried
one
is
a
victim
of
his
arts
said
another
for
when
men
have
a
reputation
for
any
particular
vice
the
world
seldom
fails
to
attribute
all
the
rest
gelsomina
seized
the
bonds
of
jacopo
and
endeavored
frantically
to
release
his
arms
i
had
hoped
thou
have
been
spared
this
sight
poor
gessina
said
the
condemned
be
not
alarmed
she
answered
gasping
for
breath
they
do
it
in
mockery
is
one
of
their
wiles
to
mislead
but
they
can
not
no
they
dare
not
harm
a
hair
of
thy
head
carlo
dearest
gelsomina
nay
do
not
hold
me
i
will
speak
to
the
citizens
and
tell
them
all
they
are
angry
now
but
when
they
know
the
truth
they
will
love
thee
carlo
as
i
do
bless
thee
bless
thee
i
would
thou
hadst
not
come
fear
not
for
me
i
am
little
used
to
such
a
crowd
but
thou
wilt
see
that
i
shall
dare
to
speak
them
fair
and
to
make
known
the
truth
boldly
i
want
but
breath
dearest
thou
hast
a
mother
a
father
to
share
thy
tenderness
duty
to
them
will
make
thee
happy
now
i
can
speak
and
thou
shalt
see
how
i
will
vindicate
thy
name
she
arose
from
the
arms
of
her
lover
who
notwithstanding
his
bonds
released
his
hold
of
her
slight
form
with
a
reluctance
greater
than
that
with
which
he
parted
with
life
the
struggle
in
the
mind
of
jacopo
seemed
over
he
bowed
his
head
passively
to
the
block
before
which
he
was
kneeling
and
it
is
probable
by
the
manner
in
which
his
hands
were
clasped
that
he
prayed
for
her
who
left
him
not
so
gelsomina
parting
her
hair
over
her
spotless
forehead
with
both
hands
she
advanced
towards
the
fishermen
who
were
familiar
to
her
eye
by
their
red
caps
and
bare
limbs
her
smile
was
like
that
which
the
imagination
would
bestow
on
the
blessed
in
their
intercourse
of
love
venetians
she
said
i
can
not
blame
you
ye
are
here
to
witness
the
death
of
one
whom
ye
believe
unfit
to
live
the
murderer
of
old
antonio
muttered
several
of
the
group
aye
even
the
murderer
of
that
aged
and
excellent
man
but
when
you
hear
the
truth
when
you
come
to
know
that
he
whom
you
have
believed
an
assassin
was
a
pious
child
a
faithful
servant
of
the
republic
a
gentle
gondolier
and
a
true
heart
you
will
change
your
bloody
purpose
for
a
wish
for
justice
a
common
murmur
drowned
her
voice
which
was
so
trembling
and
low
as
to
need
deep
stillness
to
render
the
words
audible
the
carmelite
had
advanced
to
her
side
and
he
motioned
earnestly
for
silence
hear
her
men
of
the
lagunes
he
said
she
utters
holy
truth
this
reverend
and
pious
monk
with
heaven
is
my
witness
when
you
shall
know
carlo
better
and
have
heard
his
tale
ye
will
be
the
first
to
cry
out
for
his
release
i
tell
you
this
that
when
the
doge
shall
appear
at
yon
window
and
make
the
signal
of
mercy
you
need
not
be
angry
and
believe
that
your
class
has
been
wronged
poor
carlo
the
girl
raves
interrupted
the
moody
fishermen
here
is
no
carlo
but
jacopo
frontoni
a
common
bravo
gelsomina
smiled
in
the
security
of
the
innocent
and
regaining
her
breath
which
nervous
agitation
still
disturbed
she
resumed
carlo
or
jacopo
jacopo
or
carlo
it
matters
little
ha
there
is
a
sign
from
the
palace
shouted
the
carmelite
stretching
both
his
arms
in
that
direction
as
if
to
grasp
a
boon
the
clarions
sounded
and
another
wave
stirred
the
multitude
gelsomina
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
and
turned
to
throw
herself
upon
the
bosom
of
the
reprieved
the
axe
glittered
before
her
eyes
and
the
head
of
jacopo
rolled
upon
the
stones
as
if
to
meet
her
a
general
movement
in
the
living
mass
denoted
the
end
the
dalmatians
wheeled
into
column
the
sbirri
pushed
aside
the
throng
on
their
way
to
their
haunts
the
water
of
the
bay
was
dashed
upon
the
flags
the
clotted
was
gathered
the
head
and
trunk
block
basket
axe
and
executioner
disappeared
and
the
crowd
circulated
around
the
fatal
spot
during
this
horrible
and
brief
moment
neither
father
anselmo
nor
gelsomina
moved
all
was
over
and
still
the
entire
scene
appeared
to
be
delusion
take
away
this
maniac
said
an
officer
of
the
police
pointing
to
gelsomina
as
he
spoke
he
was
obeyed
with
venetian
readiness
but
his
words
proved
prophetic
before
his
servitors
had
quitted
the
square
the
carmelite
scarce
breathed
he
gazed
at
the
moving
multitude
at
the
windows
of
the
palace
and
at
the
sun
which
shone
so
gloriously
in
the
heavens
thou
art
lost
in
this
crowd
whispered
one
at
his
elbow
reverend
carmelite
you
will
do
well
to
follow
me
the
monk
was
too
much
subdued
to
hesitate
his
conductor
led
him
by
many
secret
ways
to
a
quay
where
he
instantly
embarked
in
a
gondola
for
the
main
before
the
sun
reached
the
meridian
the
thoughtful
and
trembling
monk
was
on
his
journey
towards
the
states
of
the
church
and
ere
long
he
became
established
in
the
castle
of
sant
agata
at
the
usual
hour
the
sun
fell
behind
the
mountains
of
the
tyrol
and
the
moon
reappeared
above
the
lido
the
narrow
streets
of
venice
again
poured
out
their
thousands
upon
the
squares
the
mild
light
fell
athwart
the
quaint
architecture
and
the
giddy
tower
throwing
a
deceptive
glory
on
the
city
of
islands
the
porticoes
became
brilliant
with
lamps
the
gay
laughed
the
reckless
trifled
the
masker
pursued
his
hidden
purpose
the
cantatrice
and
the
grotesque
acted
their
parts
and
the
million
existed
in
that
vacant
enjoyment
which
distinguishes
the
pleasures
of
the
thoughtless
and
the
idle
each
lived
for
himself
while
the
state
of
venice
held
its
vicious
sway
corrupting
alike
the
ruler
and
the
ruled
by
its
mockery
of
those
sacred
principles
which
are
alone
founded
in
truth
and
natural
justice
